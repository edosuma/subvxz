00:48.950 --> 00:51.504
Oh, God. Oh, God, it hurts.

00:53.012 --> 00:53.998
Pupils are sluggish.

00:54.210 --> 00:55.538
Ophthalmoscope.

00:56.207 --> 00:58.171
She's out. Respiratory arrest.

00:58.371 --> 01:00.561
Give me an ET tube 7.0. I'll take that.

01:02.266 --> 01:03.253
Mrs. Horne.

01:03.464 --> 01:04.985
Kathleen, can you hear me?

01:05.194 --> 01:09.179
Let's give her 500cc normal saline.

01:10.189 --> 01:11.982
It's in. Let's bag her.

01:13.751 --> 01:15.408
Hyperventilate, blow off the CO-2.

01:15.615 --> 01:16.773
Let me give you a hand.

01:16.980 --> 01:18.910
A 36-year-old female, fell off a ladder.

01:19.110 --> 01:22.833
BP 70 over 50, pulse is 45,
possible bleeding in the brain.

01:23.039 --> 01:25.797
GCS 6, hematomas to the
left lower quadrant.

01:26.001 --> 01:29.395
Lacerations of the upper
right quadrant and a left thigh.

01:29.564 --> 01:30.551
Contusions on her back.

01:30.895 --> 01:33.154
She fell off the ladder
and got this banged up?

01:33.358 --> 01:35.219
I see papilledema.

01:35.423 --> 01:37.318
She's in trouble. Decorticate.

01:37.520 --> 01:38.677
Head CT.

01:38.885 --> 01:40.848
Let's lavage first.
Her abdomen's rigid.

01:41.049 --> 01:45.305
Terry, call the O.R.,
get a neurosurgeon down here now.

01:46.908 --> 01:50.767
- I'm not getting any sound down here.
- Let's get a chest and KUB too.

01:53.633 --> 01:55.993
Hey, guys, come over here. Come on.

01:58.226 --> 02:01.052
- My mom's gonna be okay, right?
- We hope so.

02:01.256 --> 02:04.150
- Is your dad coming?
- Yeah, I tried to call him.

02:04.984 --> 02:06.608
What happened to your hand?

02:07.614 --> 02:10.406
I hurt it when my mom
fell off the ladder.

02:10.610 --> 02:13.402
We've got to get you cleaned up.
Come on.

02:23.926 --> 02:25.117
See who's on for Neuro.

02:25.990 --> 02:27.318
You look awful, Carter.

02:27.521 --> 02:28.746
Exhausted.

02:28.953 --> 02:30.883
- Good morning, Carter.
- Morning.

02:31.083 --> 02:33.637
You shooting for high honors
on your ER presentation?

02:33.847 --> 02:37.672
I was up all night. It's hard putting
surgical procedures down on paper.

02:37.874 --> 02:40.201
Can I have Dr. Benton's charts, please?

02:40.405 --> 02:42.493
His patients have already been checked.

02:42.701 --> 02:44.823
Deb. Been here an hour.

02:45.165 --> 02:46.957
All right, I'll go get their labs.

02:47.162 --> 02:48.353
Deb sent them.

02:48.561 --> 02:50.853
- Breakfast orders?
- Gone to the kitchen.

02:51.390 --> 02:53.580
Oh, John, boy am I glad you're here.

02:53.787 --> 02:55.512
Jerry, thank you.

02:55.718 --> 02:58.839
I've done a census of all
6-month-olds with fever.

02:59.046 --> 03:01.941
I want to develop a protocol.
Can you help?

03:02.142 --> 03:04.264
You checked Dr. Benton's patients.

03:04.473 --> 03:06.266
Now don't be upset.

03:06.470 --> 03:09.660
Everybody likes you here.
I want to make a good impression.

03:09.865 --> 03:11.988
Carter, can you stitch up a girl in 2?

03:12.196 --> 03:13.183
Sure.

03:17.523 --> 03:20.451
This isn't a Sunday stroll, people.
Come on.

03:28.608 --> 03:32.092
Mrs. Horne's been here three
times in the last six months.

03:32.303 --> 03:35.855
She broke her arm falling down
the stairs, but no bruises.

03:36.065 --> 03:38.653
Orbital fracture walking into a door.

03:42.224 --> 03:43.744
Hi, Mandy, I'm Dr. Ross.

03:43.955 --> 03:46.883
- Let me finish up here?
- Just about to bandage it up.

03:47.084 --> 03:48.513
Let me do this.

03:50.579 --> 03:51.566
Thank you.

03:55.573 --> 03:57.434
Is my mom gonna be okay?

03:58.336 --> 03:59.663
We don't know yet.

04:02.464 --> 04:04.757
Hey, what's your name, buddy?

04:05.194 --> 04:06.385
David.

04:07.091 --> 04:08.748
Wanna come over here?

04:11.186 --> 04:13.206
Okay, you guys, look.

04:13.416 --> 04:16.207
Your mom got hurt pretty bad today.

04:16.911 --> 04:18.875
It could be a while
before she comes home.

04:19.076 --> 04:21.765
- How long?
- We don't know yet.

04:24.202 --> 04:28.061
You wanna tell me who's been hitting
your mom for the last six months?

04:28.762 --> 04:29.953
Mandy?

04:32.092 --> 04:34.781
Your mom can't take a whole
lot more of this. David?

04:37.152 --> 04:40.375
Is there somebody else staying
at the house? If we know...

04:40.581 --> 04:45.098
...we can get your mom some help, we can
find a safe place for you to stay.

04:45.308 --> 04:47.396
Things will get better for all of you.

04:47.605 --> 04:49.125
I promise that.

04:54.296 --> 04:55.283
No?

04:57.425 --> 04:58.447
All right.

04:59.056 --> 05:02.018
Okay, I'll be back when I know
more about your mom.

05:06.913 --> 05:08.774
- It was Mandy.
- Shut up, David.

05:08.976 --> 05:11.201
- It was Mandy.
- I told you to shut up!

05:11.907 --> 05:13.166
You didn't like her dress.

05:13.371 --> 05:15.425
You shut up or I'll kill you! Liar!

05:15.635 --> 05:17.496
It's not true! He's lying!

05:17.698 --> 05:19.185
She hit her with my bat.

05:19.396 --> 05:21.053
I didn't, she fell off the...

05:21.261 --> 05:22.725
She fell down.

05:31.181 --> 05:32.872
When can my mom go home?

06:23.812 --> 06:26.105
Pregnant patient in 2.
Suicide attempt's coming in.

06:26.276 --> 06:27.262
Okay, thank...

06:27.474 --> 06:29.404
Rachel. Rachel Greene.

06:31.103 --> 06:32.532
Oh, really, that's great.

06:32.734 --> 06:35.821
Tell her that her dad called
and he'll talk to her later?

06:36.029 --> 06:37.288
Thanks.

06:37.494 --> 06:41.114
Rachel's on a field trip to an aquarium.
I wish I was on a field trip.

06:41.322 --> 06:44.341
Gunshot hunting accident.
He's waiting for discharge.

06:44.519 --> 06:45.505
So discharge him.

06:45.717 --> 06:49.270
- Have we decided I'm not incompetent?
- Nobody said you were incompetent.

06:49.478 --> 06:51.839
I'm the only one who has to bring
my charts to the chief.

06:52.041 --> 06:53.868
What time is your review board?

06:54.073 --> 06:56.195
3:00.
Please don't come to offer support.

06:56.403 --> 06:58.264
God knows what you'd say.

06:59.731 --> 07:01.389
Does that happen? She's a kid.

07:01.596 --> 07:04.955
- She hit her mother with a bat?
- We see 3 or 4 of them a month.

07:05.158 --> 07:07.643
- Doug, broken leg, Exam 4.
- A nice diversion.

07:07.855 --> 07:09.443
I just can't believe it.

07:09.652 --> 07:11.910
Well, you will get used to it.

07:12.116 --> 07:13.875
Send Mrs. Neely up to the O.R.

07:14.079 --> 07:16.837
Dr. Benton, she wants her surgery
explained to her again.

07:17.042 --> 07:19.528
I've explained it to her twice.
That's enough.

07:19.705 --> 07:20.692
I could try.

07:20.904 --> 07:24.263
I'm taking a course on relating
to patients as people.

07:24.466 --> 07:26.225
It's called "The Whole Patient."

07:26.430 --> 07:29.392
Just don't let it interfere
with your work.

07:29.592 --> 07:32.078
He didn't mean that. Did he?

07:32.289 --> 07:33.651
I didn't throw him that hard.

07:33.854 --> 07:37.713
I was showing him a take-down move.
I've done it 100 times.

07:37.915 --> 07:39.436
Does this hurt, Zack?

07:40.112 --> 07:41.508
Yeah, it hurts a little.

07:41.711 --> 07:44.605
I bet it hurts a lot.
I broke my arm when I was nine.

07:44.806 --> 07:47.962
Connie, two migs of morphine, IV.
Does this hurt?

07:48.801 --> 07:51.888
Thirteen years of teaching,
this has never happened to me.

07:52.097 --> 07:55.547
Mr. Allman, it's a broken leg. Relax.

07:55.858 --> 07:58.446
Posterior tibial pulse is weak.

07:58.654 --> 08:01.310
Zack, push down on my hand,
like a gas pedal.

08:01.518 --> 08:03.311
Okay, wiggle your toes.

08:04.181 --> 08:05.338
Femur films?

08:05.513 --> 08:07.067
AP and lateral.

08:07.276 --> 08:11.102
We're gonna get you up, get you some
x-rays and see what's going on.

08:11.305 --> 08:12.769
Is it gonna hurt more?

08:12.969 --> 08:17.453
Lt'll hurt a bit, but think of the fun
you'll have getting your cast signed.

08:21.392 --> 08:24.354
She's been throwing up,
maybe you should induce labor.

08:24.554 --> 08:26.483
That's a little extreme right now.

08:26.685 --> 08:28.807
Mrs. Chang, have you had
any cramps, bleeding?

08:29.015 --> 08:30.411
It's just her stomach.

08:30.613 --> 08:34.539
You could have preeclampsia.
Your blood pressure's a little elevated.

08:34.741 --> 08:36.671
But we'll know more after the tests.

08:36.871 --> 08:40.764
Maybe the baby's in trouble. Why not
induce? It's only two weeks away.

08:40.966 --> 08:44.222
We'll take care of your wife.
Why don't you try to stay calm?

08:45.160 --> 08:46.317
<i>Who's on for Ortho?</i>

08:46.525 --> 08:47.921
Taglieri.

08:50.420 --> 08:53.473
What about Dr. Nelson?
He's still up there, isn't he?

08:53.682 --> 08:57.235
Tell Dr. Nelson, 10-year-old,
broken femur.

08:59.941 --> 09:02.698
- I need somebody a few days a week.
- Your mom's worse, huh?

09:02.904 --> 09:04.368
You know anybody?

09:04.568 --> 09:07.689
A woman on 8, part-time in physical
therapy, Jeanie Boulet.

09:07.897 --> 09:10.883
You'll like her.
As much as you like anyone.

09:11.925 --> 09:13.049
Haleh.

09:13.556 --> 09:16.212
Can you get a blood workup
on the pregnant woman in 2?

09:16.420 --> 09:18.905
The lab's completely shut down.
Just kidding.

09:19.115 --> 09:20.375
Mark, suicide attempt.

09:20.581 --> 09:25.065
Harris, Fran, 32, looks like an OD, they
found an empty bottle of imipramine.

09:25.274 --> 09:28.032
- Vitals?
- BP 50 palp, pulse 120.

09:28.237 --> 09:30.326
I started calling at 7.

09:30.534 --> 09:32.498
I should have gotten there sooner.

09:33.198 --> 09:35.059
Put her on the bed.

09:35.261 --> 09:37.225
On my count: One...

09:37.425 --> 09:39.389
Point eight Narcan.

09:39.589 --> 09:41.416
Haleh, get a glucose.

09:41.620 --> 09:43.878
- Dialysis or hemoperfusion?
- Not with tricyclics.

09:44.083 --> 09:45.637
We gotta pump her stomach.

09:45.848 --> 09:48.073
Let's get an Ewald tube and a charcoal.

09:48.278 --> 09:49.674
Draw a tox screen...

09:50.075 --> 09:52.231
...and a Rud's.
- Was she on anti-depressants?

09:52.439 --> 09:53.766
I don't know.

09:54.336 --> 09:56.765
She kept saying
she wasn't that depressed.

09:56.966 --> 09:58.759
You should take your baby outside.

09:58.963 --> 10:01.324
He's not mine. He's hers.

10:01.660 --> 10:03.919
Take him outside.
Somebody help her, please.

10:04.124 --> 10:05.849
Millette, see the bottle of pills...

10:06.054 --> 10:08.846
...get the shrink's name,
find out what else she was on.

10:09.284 --> 10:10.339
Ewald tube.

10:11.980 --> 10:14.136
Capillary refill's poor.

10:14.843 --> 10:16.965
Three liters saline.
Lavage till clear.

10:17.173 --> 10:18.864
BP's falling, 40 palp.

10:19.071 --> 10:20.296
Sinus tach 140.

10:20.969 --> 10:22.398
Seizures, Mark.

10:22.999 --> 10:24.088
Ah, crap!

10:24.597 --> 10:26.787
Valium, 10 milligrams IV push.

10:26.994 --> 10:29.479
Dilantin 1 gram at 50 migs a minute.

10:31.521 --> 10:32.577
- Hold her!
- Tachycardic.

10:34.418 --> 10:37.811
Give her an amp bicarb IV push,
then put 2 amps into that liter.

10:38.679 --> 10:39.665
Looks like torsade.

10:39.877 --> 10:42.339
Magnesium sulfate, two grams.

10:43.872 --> 10:45.426
Pulse ox is falling here.

10:45.636 --> 10:47.395
IV's infiltrated.

10:48.133 --> 10:49.358
Slow down.

10:49.565 --> 10:51.051
Slow down.

10:54.258 --> 10:56.346
Happened in gym class, wrestling.

10:58.619 --> 11:01.308
- I won't need you for the exam.
- No problem.

11:01.515 --> 11:02.604
And, Doug...

11:02.814 --> 11:06.298
I'm the attending on call.
You call me, not somebody else.

11:06.508 --> 11:08.835
It's not personal, it's professional.

11:09.039 --> 11:11.558
- Got that clear?
- Yes, John, that's clear.

11:11.768 --> 11:13.527
Hey, tiger, how you doing?

11:15.431 --> 11:16.725
Would you like to sit down?

11:16.928 --> 11:18.415
No, I should stay.

11:18.626 --> 11:21.089
When she wakes up
she'll wanna see her baby.

11:21.289 --> 11:25.047
We can't reach her therapist.
What else could she have taken?

11:25.251 --> 11:27.975
I should call her boyfriend, Carl,
he should be here.

11:28.180 --> 11:30.439
Was she taking any other prescriptions?

11:30.644 --> 11:32.470
How could she do this?

11:32.674 --> 11:33.899
She was happy.

11:34.106 --> 11:36.001
She'd gone back to school.
She was fine.

11:36.203 --> 11:37.326
If you'd just let me...

11:37.535 --> 11:40.089
- No, I'll take care of him.
- It's okay.

11:42.362 --> 11:44.291
Was she taking any other drugs?

11:44.493 --> 11:45.650
I should call Carl.

11:45.858 --> 11:48.184
Do you have a phone?
Where's the phone?

11:55.944 --> 11:57.068
Pulse ox is 60.

11:57.275 --> 11:59.534
- This isn't working.
- Still PEA.

11:59.739 --> 12:00.829
No pulse.

12:01.037 --> 12:03.432
High-dose epi, seven milligrams...

12:03.633 --> 12:05.494
...another mig of atropine.

12:07.196 --> 12:08.354
She's really cyanotic.

12:09.792 --> 12:10.983
Time down?

12:11.191 --> 12:13.347
25 minutes at least.

12:13.555 --> 12:14.576
I don't hear a thing.

12:14.786 --> 12:16.181
She's in asystole.

12:16.384 --> 12:18.245
She had to take tricyclics.

12:19.014 --> 12:21.204
Why the hell didn't you
take painkillers?

12:21.410 --> 12:24.134
Abnormal doll's eyes.
Pupils fixed and dilated.

12:25.871 --> 12:27.028
Brain stem's shot.

12:36.691 --> 12:38.121
She's gone.

12:54.867 --> 12:56.592
It's okay, buddy.

12:57.164 --> 12:58.752
You'll be okay.

13:03.355 --> 13:06.476
This mass around the bone
may represent an osteosarcoma.

13:06.685 --> 13:08.478
I can't believe I did this.

13:08.682 --> 13:10.646
Well, it turns out to be a good thing.

13:10.846 --> 13:13.071
What's the hell's good?
He broke my nephew's leg.

13:13.277 --> 13:14.706
Ted, please don't swear.

13:14.908 --> 13:17.927
Because of it we found out
about Zack's condition sooner.

13:18.136 --> 13:19.997
Wait a minute. What condition?

13:20.201 --> 13:22.187
We won't know till we get a biopsy.

13:22.397 --> 13:23.555
A biopsy?

13:24.928 --> 13:26.153
What is this, cancer?

13:26.359 --> 13:29.378
It would explain why his leg
broke so easily.

13:29.588 --> 13:32.346
My husband died of liver cancer.

13:32.551 --> 13:33.742
Is Zack gonna die?

13:33.949 --> 13:36.809
We really don't know.
It's too early to worry about that.

13:37.012 --> 13:38.941
Would you like me to talk to Zack?

13:41.639 --> 13:42.933
No.

13:43.936 --> 13:45.365
We'll tell him.

13:46.266 --> 13:47.730
I'll talk to him, all right?

13:48.996 --> 13:50.483
You have to induce labor.

13:50.694 --> 13:55.087
Your wife's tests are normal. Her
nausea was caused by something she ate.

13:55.288 --> 13:56.717
She...

13:57.818 --> 14:00.008
She had a drink from the herbalist.

14:00.215 --> 14:02.303
Her gynecologist was out of town.

14:02.512 --> 14:04.100
Your gynecologist is an herbalist?

14:04.310 --> 14:05.569
No, no...

14:06.906 --> 14:10.061
The new year is coming.
It's the Year of the Pig.

14:10.268 --> 14:15.126
And right now it's the Year of the Dog.
I can't believe I'm saying this.

14:16.560 --> 14:20.510
People think sometimes that babies born
in the Year of the Pig will be lazy.

14:20.721 --> 14:21.878
We don't believe that.

14:22.486 --> 14:24.381
I mean, we sort of believe it.

14:24.583 --> 14:27.409
I mean, my mother believes it...

14:27.612 --> 14:29.405
...and her mother believes it.

14:29.609 --> 14:31.596
So you used herbs to induce.

14:31.807 --> 14:36.495
You wanted your baby to be born in the
Year of the Dog instead of the Pig.

14:36.700 --> 14:38.822
It sounds crazy. But yes, we want...

14:39.030 --> 14:42.220
Mr. Chang, this is an emergency room,
not an auto body shop.

14:42.426 --> 14:45.286
We don't do procedures
just because you want them.

14:45.489 --> 14:46.646
Dr. Greene?

14:46.853 --> 14:48.317
I'm Dr. Noble. How are you?

14:48.519 --> 14:51.038
- Mr. And Mrs. Chang?
- I was about to discharge them.

14:51.248 --> 14:55.834
I'm checking them in. They left a
message they wanted labor induced.

14:56.041 --> 14:57.437
Some religious thing?

14:57.639 --> 14:58.626
Oh, thank God.

14:58.838 --> 15:00.029
She's not due for 10 days.

15:00.236 --> 15:03.131
We induce so people
can go on vacation, and...

15:03.332 --> 15:05.988
...on Christmas for the tax break.
What's the big deal?

15:08.192 --> 15:10.485
Have a very happy Year of the Dog.

15:12.819 --> 15:13.977
Gently...

15:14.184 --> 15:16.239
...let the water do the work.

15:19.045 --> 15:21.099
I'm not a housekeeper,
I'm a therapist.

15:21.309 --> 15:25.202
We need someone to take her for walks
and look after her a few times a week.

15:25.403 --> 15:29.421
Stroke victims need a lot of care.
I'm sure you love your mother, but...

15:29.631 --> 15:31.322
...you should be thinking nursing home.

15:31.528 --> 15:34.547
Slowly, Mr. Fayid. You're in
for an hour, no matter what.

15:34.758 --> 15:37.017
Will you at least consider it?

15:37.221 --> 15:40.377
Can you afford me?
On a resident's salary?

15:43.447 --> 15:45.206
I'll find the money.

15:48.306 --> 15:50.826
I have nursing classes
Mondays and Fridays.

15:51.036 --> 15:53.590
I'm working Saturdays here.

15:53.800 --> 15:57.727
I can do a middle of the week. We'll
try it for a while, see how it works.

15:57.927 --> 15:59.618
Okay, okay.

16:00.457 --> 16:01.921
I appreciate it.

16:02.122 --> 16:04.244
It's not a favor. I get paid.

16:05.484 --> 16:06.470
All right.

16:06.683 --> 16:07.908
That's cool.

16:11.309 --> 16:15.327
Crispy critters coming in.
Guy tried to rescue a kid from a fire.

16:15.971 --> 16:19.228
- Tag, you promised.
- Can't help it. Staff meeting's at six.

16:19.433 --> 16:21.987
We get the room at 7:30,
and I don't want to be late.

16:22.195 --> 16:24.680
I've been dreaming about this.
A romantic weekend...

16:24.892 --> 16:27.354
...with room service without
my mother or your dog.

16:27.555 --> 16:29.348
I'll try and move the meeting, okay?

16:30.385 --> 16:32.507
Gurney coming in, move over.

16:33.181 --> 16:37.335
Kane, William, entered a burning
building to save a kid. Vitals normal.

16:37.542 --> 16:39.698
My throat. It's burning!

16:39.905 --> 16:41.630
Put him in Trauma 1.

16:41.837 --> 16:45.764
Potter, Nancy, 14. Burns on her legs,
chest abrasion, hit by a falling beam.

16:45.964 --> 16:47.791
BP 90 over 50, pulse 90.

16:47.996 --> 16:50.390
All right, Connie,
we'll need blood gases.

16:50.592 --> 16:54.609
Cross-table C-spine, H and H type
and cross 4 units.

16:54.820 --> 16:56.976
Get O-negative in the meantime.

16:57.183 --> 16:58.613
All right, on my count.

16:58.815 --> 17:00.244
I can't breathe!

17:00.845 --> 17:03.864
Ready? One, two, three.

17:05.039 --> 17:06.526
I can't breathe.

17:07.736 --> 17:09.324
Let's get that mask on.

17:10.266 --> 17:12.162
Start a gram of Ancef.

17:12.363 --> 17:13.917
Connie, call the burn unit.

17:17.922 --> 17:19.409
Throat's fine.

17:19.621 --> 17:21.141
Pupils normal.

17:21.352 --> 17:23.540
How long were you
in the fire, Mr. Kane?

17:23.748 --> 17:24.837
Couple minutes.

17:25.047 --> 17:26.271
Lot of smoke.

17:26.611 --> 17:29.438
- Pulse ox is only 80.
- Respiratory's high, 36.

17:29.640 --> 17:32.194
- Is the little girl okay?
- Come on, lie back now, sir.

17:32.404 --> 17:37.092
Sounds like fluid in here. Let's get
him on a mask, 15 liters of O-2.

17:37.298 --> 17:39.954
- And a chest film, quick.
- Right, I'll go check.

17:40.160 --> 17:41.283
No distal pulses.

17:41.492 --> 17:43.251
BP's falling, 70 over 50.

17:43.455 --> 17:45.113
Open the IVs wide.

17:45.320 --> 17:46.614
Looks like a bone fragment.

17:46.818 --> 17:48.781
We got an open tib-fib fracture here.

17:48.982 --> 17:53.408
We'll need Vascular and Orthopedic.
Let's get her up to O.R. Now.

17:55.474 --> 17:56.960
All right, here we go.

17:57.538 --> 17:58.593
Coming through!

18:00.134 --> 18:01.927
O.R.'s been notified.

18:02.231 --> 18:03.593
Hold that elevator, please.

18:03.795 --> 18:05.622
- Blood's waiting.
- Carter!

18:06.293 --> 18:09.380
- Can you look at this guy outside?
- Can't somebody bring him in?

18:09.588 --> 18:12.573
- I don't think that's gonna work.
- Come on, John, let's go.

18:12.784 --> 18:16.677
Hey, I really need a cigarette.
Do you know where Lydia keeps her stash?

18:16.879 --> 18:19.138
- I didn't know you smoked.
- I don't.

18:23.470 --> 18:24.559
Uncle Ed?

18:30.294 --> 18:32.348
How long has he been "sleeping"?

18:33.224 --> 18:34.949
Since breakfast, I guess.

18:37.285 --> 18:40.270
I don't know how to tell you,
but your Uncle Ed is dead.

18:40.581 --> 18:44.339
My God! I thought he was
awful quiet back there.

18:46.673 --> 18:48.728
Jackie, I said I was gonna be there.

18:48.937 --> 18:50.594
Yeah, Michigan and Wacker.

18:50.801 --> 18:52.730
All right, I won't be late.

18:52.932 --> 18:54.157
Oh, my Lord...

18:54.363 --> 18:56.417
...that's dead.

18:58.890 --> 19:01.478
We can take him to Denver,
leave him with his son.

19:01.687 --> 19:04.581
Please move. You can't do that,
it's against the law.

19:04.783 --> 19:07.506
- Why? He's our uncle.
- Medical Examiner has to get him.

19:07.712 --> 19:10.368
His people are in Denver.
We're not burying him here.

19:10.575 --> 19:12.471
Carter, throw a sheet over him.

19:14.237 --> 19:15.825
S3 and S4 gallop.

19:16.035 --> 19:18.157
Add nitro 50 milligrams in 250 D5W.

19:18.365 --> 19:21.384
Willy. Everybody calls me Willy.

19:21.927 --> 19:23.947
How's your breathing? Okay?

19:24.890 --> 19:26.478
How's the little girl?

19:26.687 --> 19:27.981
Nancy's gonna be fine.

19:29.517 --> 19:32.309
Fire Department said
you inhaled toxic chemicals.

19:33.212 --> 19:35.368
Your lungs are badly damaged.

19:38.140 --> 19:39.569
That's not...

19:39.970 --> 19:41.661
...the only reason.

19:42.633 --> 19:43.620
CF.

19:45.596 --> 19:46.821
You have cystic fibrosis?

19:51.123 --> 19:54.414
Is there anyone you want me to call,
your wife or your family?

19:55.283 --> 19:56.440
Dad.

19:57.514 --> 19:59.773
Doug, get a pulmonary consult.

20:07.135 --> 20:09.291
Do you know Dr. Lubin's extension?

20:09.498 --> 20:12.222
4230. Lungs blown, huh?

20:13.094 --> 20:16.317
Billy, go to the third floor
and get us some gauze.

20:17.787 --> 20:19.841
Six gross of gloves and no 4-by-4s.

20:20.051 --> 20:21.639
Thanks.

20:23.081 --> 20:24.806
That must be hard for you.

20:26.177 --> 20:29.162
The overdose this morning.
Girl with the kid.

20:29.372 --> 20:30.836
I didn't have a kid.

20:31.935 --> 20:35.726
Haleh, I really try not to think
about it too much.

20:38.393 --> 20:39.721
Can I ask?

20:43.354 --> 20:44.908
Did you leave a note?

20:48.813 --> 20:50.969
I couldn't figure out what to say.

21:21.870 --> 21:23.527
When did your pain start?

21:23.735 --> 21:24.960
This morning.

21:25.499 --> 21:27.961
- Is it constant or intermittent?
- Both.

21:28.161 --> 21:30.057
I think she means it comes and goes.

21:30.260 --> 21:31.281
Is it sharp or dull?

21:31.491 --> 21:32.477
Sharp.

21:33.256 --> 21:37.183
- Ask her if she's had the pain before.
- Right, have you had this pain before?

21:37.383 --> 21:41.310
The pain is in my stomach, it hurts
like hell. What else can I tell you?

21:41.478 --> 21:42.464
Ask her about meds.

21:42.676 --> 21:45.195
Oh, do you take any medications?

21:45.406 --> 21:48.368
Yeah, Norvasc and Tenormin
for my blood pressure...

21:48.568 --> 21:52.155
...allopurinol, colchicine,
sometimes Indocin for the gout.

21:52.363 --> 21:55.484
- Zoloft for depression, Antivert for...
- Wait a minute.

21:56.192 --> 21:57.520
What did you eat today?

21:58.455 --> 21:59.942
Some granola...

22:00.153 --> 22:03.445
...a couple of poppy seed bagels,
some cheese...

22:03.648 --> 22:05.135
...a nice lamb chop.

22:06.012 --> 22:07.600
Excuse us a second.

22:08.676 --> 22:11.070
I bet it was the poppy seeds
or the granola.

22:11.272 --> 22:12.929
We better find Dr. Benton.

22:13.136 --> 22:15.622
I questioned Dr. Lewis
about every symptom.

22:16.165 --> 22:17.720
Is that the case, Dr. Lewis?

22:17.930 --> 22:20.654
I don't think so.
No. Dr. Kayson was in a hurry.

22:21.326 --> 22:25.446
Dr. Kayson, the patient,
Mr. Venerbeck, died under our care.

22:25.654 --> 22:29.047
You say you asked about every
symptom, including back pain?

22:29.248 --> 22:30.542
She should have mentioned it.

22:30.747 --> 22:33.209
You didn't tell him about
the back pain, Dr. Lewis?

22:33.410 --> 22:34.930
It was on the chart.

22:35.141 --> 22:38.466
- You should have showed me.
- Let's try to stay civil.

22:40.034 --> 22:42.758
Are you sure you gave her
your full attention?

22:42.931 --> 22:44.723
That's not the problem here.

22:44.928 --> 22:46.482
But you did sign the chart.

22:46.692 --> 22:49.154
I didn't have all
the relevant information.

22:49.356 --> 22:51.342
Aren't you supposed to obtain it?

22:51.553 --> 22:53.482
We know what this is about.

22:54.315 --> 22:56.778
We all depend on the residents
to do their job.

22:57.911 --> 23:02.032
Attendings are here to help
residents do their job.

23:05.501 --> 23:06.965
Dr. Lewis...

23:10.361 --> 23:13.754
...the back pain was ascribed
to a previous injury.

23:13.957 --> 23:16.284
How would you assess
that information now?

23:16.886 --> 23:21.313
I think I'd consider it more carefully.
A possible sign of unstable angina.

23:23.844 --> 23:25.274
We all make those judgments.

23:26.373 --> 23:27.962
And we learn from them.

23:29.869 --> 23:30.925
Ladies, gentlemen...

23:31.134 --> 23:32.995
...Dr. Lewis, Dr. Kayson.

23:45.815 --> 23:47.336
How you doing, buddy?

23:48.411 --> 23:49.898
They gonna fix my leg now?

23:52.306 --> 23:56.529
We gotta do a couple of things first.
Can I talk to you quickly, please?

24:01.295 --> 24:02.815
You haven't told him.

24:03.026 --> 24:04.614
We were gonna, but...

24:04.823 --> 24:08.342
We discussed it and we think
he's just too young to hear it.

24:08.552 --> 24:11.276
We have to do a biopsy now.
Do you understand?

24:11.481 --> 24:14.103
He doesn't need to know.
So just do it, okay?

24:14.311 --> 24:17.273
Mrs. Meeker, we won't go through
with this unless he knows.

24:17.473 --> 24:18.698
I won't do that to him.

24:29.491 --> 24:31.421
Sweetie, Zack...

24:34.917 --> 24:37.902
Sweetie, I've got to tell you something.

24:43.007 --> 24:45.436
I'm gonna let the doctor tell you...

24:54.891 --> 24:59.011
Zack, you may have a form of cancer.
You know what cancer is?

25:00.351 --> 25:03.279
Yeah, my dad had cancer and he died.

25:04.678 --> 25:06.142
Am I gonna die too?

25:06.343 --> 25:09.635
We don't think so, but you're gonna
have to go through some tests...

25:09.838 --> 25:11.268
...and that'll hurt a little.

25:11.470 --> 25:15.726
Then you'll have to take some medication
which will make you feel really sick.

25:15.930 --> 25:18.359
Am I always going to be sick?

25:18.560 --> 25:22.283
No, I think when it's all over
you're gonna be okay.

25:22.488 --> 25:23.816
What kind of tests?

25:25.018 --> 25:29.036
We're gonna put a needle
in your leg today, a little one.

25:30.312 --> 25:31.606
Are you going to do it?

25:31.810 --> 25:32.933
No.

25:34.006 --> 25:35.527
Will you come with me?

25:36.304 --> 25:37.461
Sure.

25:38.634 --> 25:41.687
So let's go do it then, okay?

25:42.629 --> 25:44.217
Okay, kiddo.

25:44.959 --> 25:46.253
Let's do it.

25:46.457 --> 25:48.919
49-year-old woman
with acute stomach pain.

25:49.121 --> 25:52.878
Leukocytosis with a high BUN.
Diet includes both seeds and nuts.

25:53.081 --> 25:55.703
Diagnosis, likely diverticulitis.
Surgical candidate.

25:55.912 --> 25:59.271
- What made you ask about her diet?
- Actually, it was Deb's idea.

26:01.404 --> 26:04.763
Well, the next time Deb has
an idea, let her present it.

26:07.097 --> 26:08.822
How did you come up with that?

26:09.926 --> 26:12.446
I have a photographic memory.
It's embarrassing...

26:12.656 --> 26:16.640
...but I saw a page of the
pocket manual in my head.

26:16.850 --> 26:20.642
Stomach pains, plus seeds or nuts,
could be diverticulitis.

26:20.812 --> 26:21.799
That's right.

26:24.274 --> 26:26.464
You could have
inflammation in the colon.

26:26.671 --> 26:29.826
If it doesn't improve in a few hours,
we'll operate.

26:30.033 --> 26:32.258
Dr. Chen will come back
and check on you.

26:37.024 --> 26:38.420
Great!

26:39.987 --> 26:41.383
You holding up?

26:43.682 --> 26:45.237
What happens now?

26:45.912 --> 26:50.101
Well, Dr. Taglieri's gonna
mark a spot on your leg.

26:50.507 --> 26:52.470
This won't hurt, it's just a pen.

26:55.799 --> 26:59.386
This is gonna feel a little cool.
Nurse cleans it.

27:00.260 --> 27:01.554
You're ready for the local?

27:01.759 --> 27:06.186
It's gonna sting a little. It's a small
needle with some stuff to dull the pain.

27:07.950 --> 27:09.142
You okay?

27:12.179 --> 27:13.165
Needle gun.

27:13.377 --> 27:15.839
This thing I told you about, the gun.

27:16.406 --> 27:19.232
Dr. Taglieri will take a piece
of the tumor out of your leg.

27:19.435 --> 27:21.523
You'll feel it when it goes in.

27:21.733 --> 27:22.890
Okay?

27:23.464 --> 27:25.756
- Ready?
- I'm ready.

27:34.116 --> 27:35.977
That's all she wrote.

27:36.513 --> 27:38.306
Wasn't so bad, was it?

27:39.809 --> 27:41.795
Never got shot before.

27:42.838 --> 27:44.824
You're gonna do okay.

27:46.767 --> 27:51.023
- This woman does this for a living.
- I've been looking at nursing homes.

27:51.227 --> 27:54.190
She's my mother too. Don't make
these decisions without me.

27:54.389 --> 27:56.012
Why do you keep fighting this?

27:56.221 --> 27:59.342
- It's the solution we're looking for.
- You're looking for.

27:59.549 --> 28:01.036
I know the solution.

28:01.913 --> 28:04.932
She goes to a nursing home
and you get our house, right?

28:05.142 --> 28:08.865
Don't give me that sentimental crap.
You wouldn't care if it burned.

28:09.070 --> 28:12.759
Don't answer that. I came all the way
across town to see you.

28:13.331 --> 28:14.421
Jackie...

28:14.963 --> 28:17.789
...I don't want to see Ma in some
warehouse for old folks.

28:17.992 --> 28:21.420
Look, Jackie, this woman will come
three times a week.

28:21.620 --> 28:24.776
- I'll look after her two times a week.
- No, you won't.

28:24.982 --> 28:26.276
You never have before.

28:26.481 --> 28:30.102
And how do you plan on paying
this physical therapist person?

28:30.709 --> 28:33.637
- Lf it's three days, I can swing it.
- Three days!

28:33.838 --> 28:37.959
God, Peter, when are you gonna accept
that Mommy needs full-time care?

28:38.898 --> 28:41.088
How are you gonna pay
for a nursing home?

28:42.227 --> 28:44.519
- Her savings.
- That's perfect.

28:44.724 --> 28:48.277
You get the house, you get to spend
every penny she ever saved.

28:48.485 --> 28:50.346
Except what she gave you
for med school.

28:50.549 --> 28:51.843
Don't even go there.

28:52.048 --> 28:53.909
I'm up to my ass in debt.

28:54.111 --> 28:58.266
And in a few years you'll make more
money than Walt and I will ever see.

28:59.505 --> 29:01.400
I'll tell you what, Peter.

29:01.602 --> 29:03.429
Take the damn house. Take it.

29:03.632 --> 29:07.082
You can even have your room back.
We'll clear out of there tomorrow.

29:07.294 --> 29:11.811
You bathe her, feed her, keep her from
undressing in front of the neighbors.

29:12.022 --> 29:14.144
Look, Jackie, we'll work it out.

29:19.079 --> 29:20.065
Hold on.

29:23.007 --> 29:24.631
Yeah, this is Benton.

29:24.838 --> 29:26.132
He did what?

29:27.102 --> 29:30.655
Tell him I'm sorry and I'm on my way.
I'll be right there, okay?

29:31.163 --> 29:32.320
I'm leaving right now.

29:32.894 --> 29:34.551
Look, Jackie, we can...

29:46.077 --> 29:47.938
I couldn't move the meeting.

29:48.140 --> 29:49.570
You're kidding.

29:50.138 --> 29:51.726
But it'll be short.

29:51.936 --> 29:56.861
- We can still get out of here by eight.
- I hope so, or I'll feel very unromantic.

29:57.529 --> 29:59.355
If I'm not here, just page me.

30:00.425 --> 30:04.579
If you're not here, I'll come up to that
meeting stark naked and drag you out.

30:06.483 --> 30:08.003
I'll see you at 8, okay?

30:15.072 --> 30:16.366
How was the review?

30:16.571 --> 30:18.034
Fine, thank you.

30:19.600 --> 30:21.960
I see you two are still
having a love-fest.

30:22.396 --> 30:23.383
Doug?

30:23.627 --> 30:25.114
Kid's been beaten up.

30:26.757 --> 30:30.945
They just kept hitting him and the cops
wouldn't even come, you know?

30:32.283 --> 30:33.407
Hey, buddy...

30:33.614 --> 30:35.975
...you're pretty banged up.
What's your name?

30:36.177 --> 30:37.233
Terry.

30:39.840 --> 30:41.826
All right, Terry.

30:42.037 --> 30:43.059
This hurt?

30:43.835 --> 30:46.025
I don't know why the cops wouldn't come.

30:46.231 --> 30:47.389
How about this?

30:47.829 --> 30:49.055
You okay, man?

30:51.324 --> 30:52.788
Any of this hurt?

30:53.356 --> 30:54.479
Nothing looks broken.

30:55.486 --> 30:57.313
I'm just taking your temperature.

30:57.583 --> 30:58.672
We should've gone away.

30:58.882 --> 31:00.039
How old are you, Terry?

31:01.411 --> 31:02.398
Eighteen.

31:02.610 --> 31:05.266
Temp 102, resp's 24.

31:06.605 --> 31:08.296
You have a fever.
Been sick?

31:09.534 --> 31:11.430
Nah, I got a cough.

31:11.632 --> 31:13.220
His lungs are clear.

31:13.429 --> 31:16.823
Let's get a CBC, lytes,
ABG and a chest film.

31:17.024 --> 31:18.283
Terry, this is Haleh.

31:18.490 --> 31:22.212
She'll clean you up, give you bandages
and get some x-rays, okay?

31:22.418 --> 31:23.779
Can I talk to you?

31:26.579 --> 31:27.566
You his girlfriend?

31:27.777 --> 31:29.707
No, I'm just his friend.

31:30.307 --> 31:32.463
We need to call his family.

31:32.838 --> 31:34.029
Do you know their number?

31:34.235 --> 31:38.458
They live someplace in Georgia
or someplace.

31:38.663 --> 31:40.490
They threw him out or he ran away.

31:42.292 --> 31:45.311
He's my best friend.
Is he gonna be okay?

31:45.520 --> 31:47.608
Where does Terry live?

31:47.818 --> 31:50.008
We don't live no place.

31:50.414 --> 31:53.342
We had this place on the West Side.
It got torn down.

31:53.910 --> 31:55.135
How old is Terry?

31:55.341 --> 31:58.303
- You heard him, he's 18.
- How old is he?

32:01.133 --> 32:02.120
Fifteen.

32:04.430 --> 32:06.393
He has to say so
or the cops'll take him.

32:07.825 --> 32:08.982
All right.

32:09.322 --> 32:11.683
Could you just take care of him? Sir?

32:11.886 --> 32:13.248
Sure. Sure.

32:17.512 --> 32:19.033
Hey, bad day?

32:19.243 --> 32:21.967
Pediatrics is fine
when the kids are healthy.

32:22.173 --> 32:24.227
How was the review board thing?

32:24.436 --> 32:27.160
They crucified Kayson.
I loved watching him squirm.

32:27.366 --> 32:29.488
So are you giving Mark a break now?

32:29.696 --> 32:30.820
Does he deserve one?

32:31.027 --> 32:34.012
- Can you help me?
- Just see the nurse back there.

32:34.224 --> 32:35.687
You guys are friends.

32:35.888 --> 32:40.473
- I've been waiting forty minutes.
- Yeah, I know. We're very busy.

32:42.346 --> 32:43.900
Sir! Sir!

32:44.909 --> 32:45.896
Come here.

32:47.273 --> 32:48.668
What is that?

32:50.236 --> 32:52.461
What does it look like?

32:52.733 --> 32:55.218
The kids next door were
playing Cowboys and Indians.

32:55.429 --> 32:57.188
How did you get here?

32:57.393 --> 32:59.152
I took the bus.

33:00.855 --> 33:01.979
You wanna just...

33:02.187 --> 33:03.708
I'll get it.

33:08.712 --> 33:12.140
Doctors said he had five
or six years left.

33:15.004 --> 33:16.990
He's not gonna make it, is he?

33:17.200 --> 33:19.958
His lungs are filling with fluid.

33:20.164 --> 33:24.852
We'll suction them out,
but they will fill back up again.

33:25.057 --> 33:27.713
Eventually we'll have to put him
on a respirator.

33:28.186 --> 33:30.206
He never had kids.

33:30.417 --> 33:32.380
He said it wouldn't be fair.

33:32.580 --> 33:34.770
He wouldn't be around
long enough for them.

33:35.277 --> 33:36.605
Five...

33:37.008 --> 33:38.733
...six years.

33:39.937 --> 33:41.491
It's a lot of time.

33:41.702 --> 33:43.631
New blood gases. Not good.

33:43.832 --> 33:46.817
PO-2 is 50, PCO-2's 60.

33:47.161 --> 33:49.215
They brought the girl
down from the fire.

33:49.425 --> 33:51.887
Her mother says she wants
to talk to him.

33:53.120 --> 33:56.843
The Versed has him under.
He might not be able to hear her.

33:57.681 --> 33:58.906
It's okay?

33:59.312 --> 34:00.402
Sure.

34:08.600 --> 34:09.962
What's his name?

34:10.797 --> 34:11.954
Willy.

34:13.627 --> 34:14.750
His name's Willy.

34:15.690 --> 34:16.780
Willy...

34:18.021 --> 34:19.077
...my name's Nancy.

34:20.516 --> 34:21.913
Nancy Potter.

34:23.214 --> 34:24.768
You saved me from the fire.

34:24.978 --> 34:26.601
Can you hear her, son?

34:29.039 --> 34:30.628
Thank you, Willy.

34:32.534 --> 34:33.998
Thank you for getting me.

34:46.117 --> 34:47.739
Good afternoon to you, Dr. Benton.

34:47.949 --> 34:50.139
- I don't want to talk about it.
- I didn't ask.

34:50.344 --> 34:53.274
You know, for the first time
I've missed grand rounds.

34:53.474 --> 34:56.833
- What do I tell Morgenstern?
- You had something more important to do.

34:57.036 --> 34:58.331
Yeah, right.

34:58.534 --> 35:01.429
You know, pediatrics,
you guys got it made.

35:01.630 --> 35:03.651
You all go into private practice.

35:03.861 --> 35:07.448
But surgeons, we all wanna be chief.

35:08.821 --> 35:11.113
One more day like this,
I don't have a prayer.

35:11.318 --> 35:13.837
There are more important things
than being chief.

35:14.048 --> 35:16.237
Yeah, right. Like what?

35:16.545 --> 35:20.938
This morning I had a little girl
beat up her mom, and her mom is dead.

35:21.138 --> 35:23.794
Another kid with osteosarcoma
might lose his leg.

35:24.002 --> 35:26.657
Another one with cystic fibrosis...

35:29.227 --> 35:30.782
It's the middle of winter...

35:30.992 --> 35:32.616
...my apartment is freezing...

35:32.823 --> 35:37.307
...and the woman that I vaguely
thought might stay with me...

35:37.517 --> 35:40.105
...said that I'm not the kind of guy...

35:40.313 --> 35:42.639
...that women marry.

35:45.174 --> 35:47.034
So I'm gonna go shoot some hoops.

35:57.524 --> 35:59.045
You wanna share the court?

35:59.255 --> 36:00.742
Play you one-on-one.

36:01.252 --> 36:03.216
- I'm Doug.
- Jake.

36:03.416 --> 36:04.710
Nickel a point.

36:04.914 --> 36:06.071
Dime. To 21.

36:06.279 --> 36:08.605
Okay, dump that.
Let's go, right now.

36:09.275 --> 36:12.033
My mom works at the hospital.
Diane Leeds, you know her?

36:12.238 --> 36:14.065
Nope!

36:16.266 --> 36:17.594
Lucky shot.

36:19.162 --> 36:20.149
What's your mom do?

36:20.494 --> 36:23.320
She's on the 7th floor.
I'm waiting for her.

36:24.522 --> 36:26.382
Oh, very fancy!

36:26.885 --> 36:28.440
Drains it.

36:28.616 --> 36:29.808
Nice.

36:30.281 --> 36:32.937
- We're going to the Bulls tonight.
- Who's your favorite?

36:33.144 --> 36:34.335
B.J. Armstrong.

36:34.543 --> 36:35.666
Mine too. Know why?

36:35.873 --> 36:37.632
He's short, just like I was.

36:41.666 --> 36:43.822
- You're good for a short guy.
- Thank you.

36:44.530 --> 36:47.515
- Jacob?
- Damn it!

36:49.123 --> 36:52.313
- Hi, Mom.
- Hi, kiddo. I'm sorry I'm late.

36:52.585 --> 36:53.947
You got a killer player.

36:54.150 --> 36:55.478
He's a pretty tough guy.

36:55.681 --> 36:57.667
Much longer, I'll be
paying his allowance.

36:57.879 --> 36:59.274
I wish you would.

36:59.476 --> 37:02.835
Video games alone I could go broke.
Are you ready, hon?

37:03.438 --> 37:06.298
I'm Doug Ross.
Pediatrics in the ER.

37:07.998 --> 37:09.791
Diane Leeds, Risk Management.

37:09.996 --> 37:12.753
- Yeah, we spoke on the phone once.
- Dr. Ross...

37:12.959 --> 37:17.409
...before you try any harder,
Cindy Sadwick is a very good friend.

37:19.183 --> 37:20.477
How is Cindy?

37:20.682 --> 37:25.166
She can't say your name without adding
a few words I don't want my son to hear.

37:25.376 --> 37:27.169
Tell her I said hello.

37:27.872 --> 37:28.962
Right.

37:32.034 --> 37:33.225
I owe you a dime.

37:33.432 --> 37:36.451
You'll win it back from me next time.
Have fun at the game.

37:49.777 --> 37:51.865
Rescue 61, MI on the way in.

37:52.074 --> 37:55.093
53-year-old male, drunk out of
his gourd at Shaw's Crab House.

37:55.303 --> 37:58.493
A drunken coronary.
Can you talk Mark into taking it?

37:58.699 --> 38:01.957
He quit. He's now the house doctor
at Field's.

38:03.892 --> 38:07.184
Department meeting. Benton's in
surgery, Mintzer went home sick.

38:07.387 --> 38:09.112
I wish I could go home sick.

38:09.319 --> 38:11.747
Susan! We got a chest pain here!

38:11.949 --> 38:14.343
Trauma 2. Trauma 2's open.

38:14.545 --> 38:17.904
Patient complained of a mid-sternal
chest pain, vomited twice.

38:18.106 --> 38:20.161
Sublingual nitro, 2 migs morphine.

38:20.370 --> 38:22.832
- Says he's a doctor.
- Sir, are you...

38:23.034 --> 38:24.464
Oh, my God.

38:24.665 --> 38:27.060
- Dr. Kayson.
- Dr. Lewis.

38:40.344 --> 38:43.238
This is aspirin, Dr. Kayson.
Can you chew?

38:43.706 --> 38:44.830
Start chewing.

38:45.038 --> 38:46.332
BP 150 over 100.

38:46.536 --> 38:47.830
O-2, fifteen liters.

38:48.034 --> 38:51.292
Dr. Kayson, I know how you feel
about TPA. Do you want it?

38:52.062 --> 38:53.390
I don't know.

38:53.593 --> 38:58.519
Cath lab is prepping for angioplasty.
The choice is yours, but make it now.

38:58.721 --> 39:00.275
Run a twelve-lead.

39:00.484 --> 39:01.971
Where's Steinman?

39:02.183 --> 39:05.769
He's in surgery, Cardiology will
be here as soon as they can.

39:06.377 --> 39:08.272
Tachy 120, resp's 24.

39:08.474 --> 39:09.496
His blood results?

39:09.706 --> 39:11.261
What's the EKG say?

39:11.470 --> 39:13.456
ST elevation in the inferior leads.

39:14.267 --> 39:17.695
- I'm gonna die.
- You are not going to die.

39:17.895 --> 39:20.619
- BP's crashing, he's bradycardic.
- No, cardiogenic shock.

39:20.824 --> 39:23.185
Okay, ET tube 7.0.

39:23.421 --> 39:25.408
Full respiratory down.

39:25.618 --> 39:27.173
Open up the IV.

39:30.345 --> 39:32.400
Bolus one milligram atropine IV.

39:33.974 --> 39:35.597
It's falling, 60 over 35.

39:35.805 --> 39:37.235
Start a dopamine drip.

39:39.234 --> 39:40.528
Tube's in.

39:40.731 --> 39:41.753
Bag him.

39:41.964 --> 39:44.392
All right, he may need a pacemaker.

39:45.991 --> 39:48.783
- Carotid's okay.
- Let's get him upstairs. Now!

39:54.447 --> 39:58.533
Haleh, call Cardiology. Tell them
he's stable, he needs angioplasty.

39:58.742 --> 40:01.035
See if anyone's gotten
ahold of his wife.

40:04.002 --> 40:05.465
Coming through!

40:09.228 --> 40:11.486
What is this, a convention?

40:15.187 --> 40:17.150
- Is that a joke?
- No.

40:21.312 --> 40:24.762
- Hey, Terry, how you feeling?
- Better.

40:25.906 --> 40:28.131
I want to talk to you
about your condition.

40:28.336 --> 40:31.820
You heard of PCP,
pneumocystis pneumonia?

40:36.192 --> 40:37.418
AIDS, huh?

40:37.624 --> 40:42.482
We need to confirm the diagnosis, but if
it's PCP, then yes, you may have AIDS.

40:44.448 --> 40:47.036
Angie, don't cry, don't cry, please.

40:47.245 --> 40:49.072
Come on.

40:52.371 --> 40:56.355
Would you get my coat
and stuff, please?

40:56.833 --> 40:59.058
Go on, get my coat.

40:59.262 --> 41:02.383
You still working the street, Terry?
You playing safe?

41:04.489 --> 41:06.146
They don't want you using rubbers.

41:06.885 --> 41:09.075
It's not what they pay for.

41:09.283 --> 41:12.370
We'll check you in, do an HIV test
and treat your pneumonia.

41:12.578 --> 41:16.131
Thanks anyway, but no thanks.
I just want to get out of here.

41:16.340 --> 41:18.734
If you have sex with people
you'll infect them.

41:18.937 --> 41:22.296
I gotta feed myself, right?
And some of my friends too.

41:22.498 --> 41:24.553
You're sick and you'll get sicker.

41:24.762 --> 41:28.121
We can stop the pneumonia
and put you on a program for AZT.

41:29.057 --> 41:31.679
Hey, man, I'm okay.

41:31.887 --> 41:35.780
Listen to me. You are not gonna get
healthier on the street.

41:35.981 --> 41:38.466
Can you go home? Is there anyone
to take you in?

41:40.009 --> 41:41.666
They threw me out.

41:42.773 --> 41:44.997
They won't be taking me back now.

41:53.758 --> 41:54.780
Use these condoms.

41:57.719 --> 42:00.909
I'll get you a medicine called Bactrim.
Take it every day.

42:01.115 --> 42:04.009
The only time I took medicine
every day was in jail.

42:04.211 --> 42:05.233
Please try.

42:05.442 --> 42:08.700
And use the condoms, Terry.
Use the condoms.

42:12.400 --> 42:17.326
Here's some numbers for a shelter and
an AIDS treatment center. Keep this.

42:17.526 --> 42:18.785
You'll need it, okay?

42:19.690 --> 42:21.120
All right.

42:21.321 --> 42:22.479
Thanks.

42:29.677 --> 42:33.298
Your wife's on the way. Steinman will
take you to the cath lab.

42:33.505 --> 42:36.059
Nod if that's what you want.

42:36.235 --> 42:37.222
Do you want TPA?

42:39.098 --> 42:41.686
Jack, you look great.
We'll blow your arteries out.

42:41.895 --> 42:44.085
Dr. Steinman, he wants TPA.

42:44.291 --> 42:46.380
I looked at your echo.
You need angioplasty.

42:48.386 --> 42:50.871
You're scared.
We did hundreds of these last year.

42:51.915 --> 42:54.571
When this is over, stop smoking
and start jogging.

42:55.810 --> 42:58.170
- Let's move him.
- You can't do that.

42:58.340 --> 43:02.131
He's my patient. He doesn't want
angioplasty, he wants TPA.

43:02.335 --> 43:03.855
Dr. Lewis?

43:04.066 --> 43:07.619
This man's under sedation,
he's in no condition to make a decision.

43:08.660 --> 43:11.282
Stop this adolescent behavior
and get out of my way.

43:11.490 --> 43:14.145
If you take him I'll see you
at a review committee.

43:14.352 --> 43:17.802
They will fry your ass so fast
you'll be lucky to keep your license.

43:20.411 --> 43:22.601
Please order the TPA.
Get it in here right now.

43:45.545 --> 43:47.406
That was really dull.

43:49.406 --> 43:51.369
I guess I'll have to try it again.

43:51.970 --> 43:55.523
Maybe we should use that stuff
you got in New Orleans last year.

43:55.731 --> 43:56.855
Really?

43:57.063 --> 43:59.526
You still have some of that
edible massage oil?

43:59.726 --> 44:01.213
It gave you a rash.

44:01.424 --> 44:03.411
We could try a different flavor.

44:05.053 --> 44:06.641
Where's my bag?

44:06.851 --> 44:09.279
You know, that little Gladstone bag?

44:09.947 --> 44:12.273
What? You had it.

44:15.140 --> 44:16.399
You're joking.

44:16.804 --> 44:18.529
No, I'm not.

44:21.364 --> 44:22.726
Where is it?

44:24.594 --> 44:27.817
I brought the bags downstairs,
I stopped to get you.

44:31.119 --> 44:33.377
I'll never be able to go to work again.

44:35.612 --> 44:36.974
Where did you leave it?

44:37.178 --> 44:40.106
Admissions. Under the desk.

44:50.660 --> 44:52.385
Doug, you sleeping?

44:53.623 --> 44:54.951
I wish.

44:57.152 --> 44:59.410
How many kids am I gonna see this year?

45:00.148 --> 45:02.406
Based on last year...

45:03.010 --> 45:04.066
...3000, give or take.

45:07.405 --> 45:09.731
I feel like I saw them all today.

45:12.364 --> 45:13.885
Baby with croup.

45:14.429 --> 45:16.221
God love the croup.

45:17.325 --> 45:19.652
At least it's something I can fix.

45:21.819 --> 45:23.645
You okay?

45:23.816 --> 45:24.905
Yeah.

45:26.380 --> 45:27.639
I'm coming.
