00:34.434 --> 00:35.958
Here you go. Thank you.

00:36.036 --> 00:37.936
I'll be right back with your order.

00:41.708 --> 00:42.868
Good morning, Bill.

00:51.518 --> 00:53.918
Let me guess. Pancakes, side of bacon.

00:54.421 --> 00:56.252
Who's dying? Come on, pick it up.

00:57.090 --> 00:59.456
Phil, Big Papa, please? I need 15.

00:59.659 --> 01:01.957
I love it when you call me Big Papa.

01:03.997 --> 01:05.931
Hey, you're up early today.

01:08.968 --> 01:10.799
Okay, you're good to go.

01:12.872 --> 01:14.203
Is this yours?

01:20.880 --> 01:22.438
Does that line ever work?

01:22.749 --> 01:24.410
What's the problem here?

01:25.385 --> 01:26.613
It's hot!

01:34.828 --> 01:36.193
Here you go.

01:37.263 --> 01:38.525
Sorry.

01:46.306 --> 01:51.005
Why not? My grandfather was a lawyer.
Plus, I have a logical mind.

01:51.244 --> 01:56.079
And you're only, like, what?
$299,000 short of what you need for law school?

01:56.282 --> 01:57.909
-Piece of cake.
-Piece of pie.

01:57.984 --> 02:00.851
Piece of ass. So what would you do?

02:02.489 --> 02:04.457
-I don't know.
-Liar.

02:04.858 --> 02:08.419
You know, I was thinking
I could go back to school full-time.

02:09.662 --> 02:12.790
And quit here? I won't allow it, Slim.

02:13.066 --> 02:15.034
-Careful, it's hot.
-Sorry, sir.

02:17.170 --> 02:20.071
-Ever try the Roc?
-What?

02:20.907 --> 02:24.900
It's the deodorant thing.
It's like salts or something.

02:25.845 --> 02:30.305
You rub it on your pits.
It looks like some kind of hippie crystal.

02:33.052 --> 02:35.247
-Are you saying I sweat?
-No, you just....

02:35.321 --> 02:37.915
-Do I smell?
-No. God....

02:38.925 --> 02:41.553
-Ladies?
-Okay. Your turn.

02:41.961 --> 02:43.326
I'm sweating too much.

02:52.172 --> 02:53.662
You waiting for somebody?

02:56.276 --> 02:58.471
-Something to drink?
-Just water, thanks.

02:59.078 --> 03:00.807
I'll give you a minute to look at the menu.

03:00.880 --> 03:04.111
That's okay. I was in here yesterday, Slim.

03:06.452 --> 03:08.682
-What's your real name?
-No.

03:10.023 --> 03:12.924
I like it. Don't you think
it's kind of negative, though?

03:12.992 --> 03:14.721
No, I don't tell my name.

03:15.862 --> 03:17.022
Okay.

03:17.397 --> 03:22.130
Give me the soup, turkey burger,
coleslaw, couple of extra slices of tomato.

03:22.302 --> 03:25.328
I write books. Do you read books?
What are you reading now?

03:28.808 --> 03:32.608
You know Finnegans Wake by James Joyce?

03:33.012 --> 03:36.140
My friend told me it's the hardest book
in the English language.

03:36.216 --> 03:40.448
I mean, not the hardest,
but the hardest one that you can actually read.

03:40.720 --> 03:44.781
I thought to myself, if I can get through it,
I could probably read the rest.

03:44.857 --> 03:47.189
-How long have you been reading it?
-Six years.

03:47.560 --> 03:49.152
I'll be back with your soup.

03:51.798 --> 03:54.062
-He likes you.
-He's a dick.

03:55.468 --> 03:58.869
-He was in here yesterday, you know?
-I know.

03:58.938 --> 04:03.807
Now he's back today, he brought a rose,
he pulls you into conversation.

04:04.410 --> 04:05.843
Okay, so he likes me.

04:06.045 --> 04:09.811
-So, do you like him?
-I don't know him.

04:10.750 --> 04:15.346
What's that got to do with anything?
He's a major piece of cake, piece of pie.

04:16.522 --> 04:19.047
Trust me, okay? He's carrot cake.

04:19.959 --> 04:24.020
And when a guy like that,
who's actually cuter than you, likes you....

04:24.564 --> 04:25.929
He's cuter than me?

04:25.999 --> 04:29.127
Face it, no one will ever go for you
because of your looks.

04:29.335 --> 04:32.202
That sucks, because my personality bites.

04:36.142 --> 04:37.632
Cup of soup.

04:40.780 --> 04:42.714
You don't really write books, do you?

04:43.116 --> 04:43.912
No.

04:44.050 --> 04:47.349
I haven't really been reading
Finnegans Wake either.

04:48.888 --> 04:50.219
I'm going into law...

04:50.823 --> 04:51.949
...enforcement.

04:53.059 --> 04:54.492
Who's the rose for?

04:58.798 --> 04:59.958
Enjoy your grub.

05:01.167 --> 05:02.156
Hey!

05:06.839 --> 05:07.828
You.

05:14.047 --> 05:15.605
How much did you settle on?

05:17.884 --> 05:19.181
Excuse me?

05:19.886 --> 05:22.252
The bet. How much is it?

05:27.226 --> 05:29.990
You and your friend, yesterday, was it $200?

05:30.530 --> 05:32.930
Was it $500? What was it?

05:34.967 --> 05:35.956
What?

05:37.737 --> 05:39.466
He bet his friend...

05:40.340 --> 05:43.241
...that he could get into your pants
by noon tomorrow.

05:44.744 --> 05:47.178
Is this your business?
Are you the morals police?

05:48.781 --> 05:51.545
Take it easy, man. I was just having some fun.

05:53.019 --> 05:55.579
What was it? $200 or $500?

05:57.090 --> 05:58.853
I want to know what I'm worth.

06:00.193 --> 06:01.626
The bet was for $200.

06:02.762 --> 06:04.730
But now that I know you...

06:06.599 --> 06:07.930
...way too high.

06:12.939 --> 06:14.531
Don't come back here again...

06:14.941 --> 06:15.908
...ever.

06:26.052 --> 06:27.849
I'm sorry to get in your business.

06:28.154 --> 06:29.485
No. Thanks.

06:30.723 --> 06:33.157
I can't believe you actually said something.

06:33.860 --> 06:35.487
I'd have felt bad about it...

06:35.995 --> 06:37.485
...if I'd have kept quiet.

06:39.432 --> 06:40.831
Good luck.

07:21.240 --> 07:25.836
Please tell me, Phil, as Mitch was rather vague...

07:26.679 --> 07:28.442
...is her father dead, too?

07:28.681 --> 07:32.640
Well, he is to her.
He left when she was maybe two or three.

07:33.820 --> 07:37.984
-Then I'm happy to pay for the wedding.
-Yes, we're very happy.

07:40.359 --> 07:41.826
You sure you love me?

07:44.063 --> 07:45.621
Forever and ever?

07:48.201 --> 07:49.725
You're safe with me, Slim.

07:50.536 --> 07:54.495
You're safe, and it's okay to be happy.
We deserve it.

08:00.046 --> 08:03.743
-Wait, so this was during or after college?
-During.

08:06.719 --> 08:08.243
What's wrong with you?

08:10.223 --> 08:13.158
No, I mean, why did you and Slim break up?

08:15.161 --> 08:16.788
I'm terrible in bed.

08:18.130 --> 08:21.463
Plus, she had to drop out,
some money problems...

08:21.534 --> 08:24.025
...and so we kind of evolved into being friends.

08:28.574 --> 08:30.201
What do you think?

08:39.719 --> 08:41.778
Can I take you home right now?

08:42.154 --> 08:43.985
If you've got a sense of humor.

08:44.423 --> 08:46.482
My kids are out for tonight--

08:46.559 --> 08:50.689
I live in Seattle.
Women always want the possibility of long-term.

08:51.230 --> 08:53.221
I didn't just propose.

08:54.000 --> 08:56.230
I just thought that maybe we could...

08:56.302 --> 09:00.500
...have a brief,
totally unsatisfying sexual encounter.

09:02.108 --> 09:03.473
I'm your guy.

09:09.682 --> 09:12.310
Excuse me, I'm sorry, I'm sorry...

09:13.653 --> 09:16.918
...but I've got to get up at 5:00 in the morning
to buy green beans.

09:16.989 --> 09:18.149
Now...

09:18.724 --> 09:22.626
...l know you don't need it,
but it's tradition in my family...

09:23.429 --> 09:26.762
-...to give money to the groom.
-That's sweet.

09:28.401 --> 09:31.996
Thank you, Phil.
And thank you for giving me away today.

09:32.705 --> 09:35.299
You're the best substitute father a girl ever had.

09:35.641 --> 09:37.905
No substitute. I'm the real thing.

09:40.546 --> 09:41.774
Thank you.

09:47.820 --> 09:49.185
He really loves you.

09:50.890 --> 09:52.050
Yeah.

09:54.760 --> 09:56.421
You gonna give me babies, Slim?

09:57.897 --> 09:59.057
Yeah.

09:59.999 --> 10:01.489
How soon?

10:03.402 --> 10:05.233
How soon can we get out of here?

10:12.712 --> 10:14.509
-Hi.
-Hello.

10:15.448 --> 10:17.211
We've been driving around...

10:17.717 --> 10:21.710
...and my wife has fallen completely in love
with your house.

10:23.322 --> 10:24.949
Yes, it's great, isn't it?

10:25.992 --> 10:29.519
We want to buy it. She wants it for our family.

10:33.366 --> 10:37.200
-Well, it's.... We're not selling.
-Sure you are.

10:38.938 --> 10:40.269
That's the price.

10:42.041 --> 10:43.906
Don't worry, it's well over market.

10:47.913 --> 10:50.780
-You're out of your mind.
-I know, that's just it.

10:51.250 --> 10:53.081
So before you say no again...

10:54.086 --> 10:57.613
...think how miserable one determined,
crazy person can make you.

10:57.990 --> 11:02.484
Miserable today, tomorrow,
pretty much every day, until the day you sell.

11:04.430 --> 11:07.558
Your kids are grown,
you'll be happier in a smaller place.

11:28.621 --> 11:31.215
Parker, how are you? How's the jump shot?

11:33.059 --> 11:33.821
Mitch!

11:33.893 --> 11:36.384
-Not now, sweetie.
-It's Slim.

11:36.996 --> 11:38.657
Give me a second. Yeah?

11:39.932 --> 11:41.058
What?

11:43.169 --> 11:47.367
Hey, Parker!
Parker, give me a ride to the hospital.

11:48.007 --> 11:49.474
Look after the client.

12:07.026 --> 12:09.358
She looks just like my baby pictures.

12:11.931 --> 12:13.159
Don't you?

12:19.805 --> 12:20.863
Who was that?

12:21.407 --> 12:24.843
I don't know. Who cares?
Some construction thing.

12:25.411 --> 12:27.106
Bring her here. Let me see.

12:27.179 --> 12:29.909
That's my baby, that's my baby.

12:44.697 --> 12:46.028
What do you got there?

12:48.901 --> 12:51.096
Okay. Let's put it out here.

12:54.940 --> 12:56.430
What's that one?

13:16.195 --> 13:17.184
Hey.

13:22.535 --> 13:23.524
Hey.

13:23.869 --> 13:25.393
Should I join you?

13:27.706 --> 13:29.298
No. I'm about to get out.

13:31.110 --> 13:34.341
I'm just showering to wake myself up.
I got to go back to work.

13:35.781 --> 13:37.442
-Sorry.
-Yeah.

13:39.718 --> 13:40.878
Me, too.

15:03.769 --> 15:05.828
Hi, darling. Where are you?

15:08.207 --> 15:10.402
You just paged my husband, right?

15:10.676 --> 15:12.007
Oh, my God.

15:12.611 --> 15:13.600
Mitch?

15:15.781 --> 15:17.544
Who are you? What's your name?

15:18.450 --> 15:20.008
I'm so sorry, l--

15:20.185 --> 15:22.710
No, it's too late to deny it now.

15:24.256 --> 15:26.918
-Your name?
-I have to go.

15:27.126 --> 15:29.856
Don't hang up. Don't be a coward.

15:33.432 --> 15:34.990
Just tell me your name.

15:35.634 --> 15:38.068
That's the least you could do, don't you think?

15:39.104 --> 15:41.834
I'm Darcelle. I'm very sorry.

16:38.764 --> 16:39.753
Hey.

16:44.503 --> 16:45.765
She paged you.

16:48.240 --> 16:49.229
Who?

16:50.075 --> 16:51.770
Number 33. Darcelle.

16:58.317 --> 16:59.784
I guess you're late.

17:06.125 --> 17:07.683
She's French?

17:08.660 --> 17:10.890
-She's not important.
-No?

17:11.396 --> 17:13.058
-You're important.
-Yeah.

17:13.632 --> 17:15.065
And Gracie.

17:19.003 --> 17:20.733
I must be brain-dead.

17:21.040 --> 17:25.136
I must be the biggest moron on the planet
because I thought we were happy.

17:25.411 --> 17:26.673
Were we happy?

17:27.512 --> 17:29.606
And I used to think we were so lucky.

17:30.682 --> 17:32.673
And I thought in bed we were still....

17:32.851 --> 17:34.842
-Slim, please.
-No.

17:35.421 --> 17:38.288
-You said I was safe with you.
-You are.

17:38.590 --> 17:40.854
You are. I promise.

17:43.662 --> 17:44.856
I'm sorry.

17:46.532 --> 17:49.194
I'm so sorry. I'm sorry.

17:59.878 --> 18:01.937
Everything is going to be okay.

18:13.492 --> 18:15.357
-I can smell her.
-What?

18:16.528 --> 18:18.052
Her perfume.

18:18.997 --> 18:22.228
-Darcelle, or whoever.
-We just had a drink.

18:22.301 --> 18:23.393
Stop it!

18:24.036 --> 18:28.632
You're caught! I caught you!
And you won't talk your way out of this.

18:31.443 --> 18:32.569
How many, Mitch?

18:34.279 --> 18:37.373
How many are there?
How many have there been?

18:37.649 --> 18:39.048
What does it matter?

18:41.887 --> 18:46.449
It's not that our sex life hasn't been good.
It's been great, Slim. But I'm a man.

18:47.493 --> 18:49.427
Men and women have different needs...

18:50.863 --> 18:52.763
...and that's okay. Darcelle's....

18:53.565 --> 18:58.093
She's willing to take care of that,
and maybe that's better for everybody.

18:58.403 --> 18:59.870
It's better for you!

19:00.973 --> 19:03.066
You have a pretty good deal, don't you?

19:03.142 --> 19:07.841
You go out, you fool around!
I sit here, take care of your house and kid.

19:08.580 --> 19:10.070
Well, no more, Mitch!

19:10.516 --> 19:12.484
That's it! The party is over!

19:12.551 --> 19:15.042
-Calm down.
-I won't do this anymore.

19:15.454 --> 19:19.220
I won't sit here and take it, and take it, and take it.

19:19.491 --> 19:22.051
Sorry! I love you, yes.

19:22.494 --> 19:26.863
But I am not a doormat!
I'm your wife. I'm your wife.

19:27.366 --> 19:31.029
And you cannot do this to me!
You cannot do this to me anymore.

19:37.409 --> 19:39.877
What? I can't hit you?

19:43.115 --> 19:44.446
No, you can't.

19:50.989 --> 19:52.456
You want to fight?

19:53.058 --> 19:54.923
I'm a man, honey, it's no contest.

19:56.094 --> 19:58.585
You have to understand, and I thought you did.

19:59.097 --> 20:03.659
I make the money here,
so I set the rules, right? It's my rules.

20:04.303 --> 20:05.634
You're with me?

20:07.439 --> 20:08.736
It's your rules.

20:09.575 --> 20:10.564
Yeah.

20:11.610 --> 20:14.841
-And what if I don't like the rules?
-If you don't like them?

20:16.515 --> 20:19.678
Come on, sweetie,
life isn't just stuff we like, is it?

20:20.118 --> 20:22.450
We have to take the good with the bad.

20:23.055 --> 20:24.886
That's what marriage is.

20:28.160 --> 20:32.756
So, for you, maybe today is a bad day.
Tomorrow may be great.

20:34.466 --> 20:36.331
Tomorrow will be great.

20:38.937 --> 20:39.926
Yeah.

20:41.673 --> 20:43.004
Today...

20:44.176 --> 20:46.872
...is the price you pay for having such a good life.

20:47.879 --> 20:49.107
I'm going to go out.

20:53.051 --> 20:54.951
This will be better, don't you think?

20:55.020 --> 20:58.456
I don't have to sneak around
and pretend I'm going to work. I can say:

20:59.992 --> 21:03.553
"I'm going to Darcelle's.
I'll be back in a few hours."

21:17.809 --> 21:21.677
Just so you don't do anything later
you might regret. Okay?

22:10.529 --> 22:11.894
Who are you calling?

22:14.433 --> 22:15.422
Your mother.

22:16.401 --> 22:17.800
What will you tell her?

22:18.570 --> 22:21.869
I was supposed to bring Gracie by tomorrow,
so I better cancel.

22:24.643 --> 22:26.702
You know, love is a scary thing.

22:27.879 --> 22:30.370
How powerful it is, what it does to you.

22:32.050 --> 22:33.745
That is what happened here.

22:35.220 --> 22:37.211
See, if I ever think of....

22:39.658 --> 22:41.421
I just.... I can't....

22:42.160 --> 22:45.129
I refuse to live without you.

22:47.833 --> 22:50.233
I think you understand what I'm saying.

23:09.621 --> 23:11.589
Hey, you're late.

23:11.923 --> 23:15.757
Where have you been? You are late.
I was worried you weren't coming at all.

23:18.563 --> 23:20.053
No Gracie?

23:22.367 --> 23:24.597
We will have a regular girls' luncheon...

23:24.669 --> 23:27.331
...and we will gossip about absolutely everybody.

23:34.780 --> 23:36.907
My poor baby. My God.

23:37.182 --> 23:38.672
Honey, I am so sorry.

23:44.790 --> 23:47.782
What did you do? What did you say to him?

23:52.030 --> 23:53.827
Men are like land mines.

23:54.666 --> 23:57.965
Some you trigger the first week,
others it's years in.

23:58.136 --> 24:00.502
The problem is you want a man-man.

24:00.872 --> 24:05.673
Meaning his veins run thick with testosterone,
which is good.

24:05.877 --> 24:09.074
But then he can turn around
without any warning and...

24:09.848 --> 24:10.837
...hit you.

24:11.283 --> 24:13.080
I'm not this person.

24:14.786 --> 24:17.812
I'm not a person whose husband beats her up.

24:18.123 --> 24:19.454
I know.

24:26.731 --> 24:28.358
What do I do?

24:30.502 --> 24:31.867
You got to go to the cops.

24:34.806 --> 24:39.573
He's the father of my child, okay?
I will not put him in jail!

24:40.545 --> 24:42.137
Hold on. I'm sorry.

24:42.848 --> 24:46.750
I'm sorry, okay? Sit down. Relax for a second.

24:50.255 --> 24:54.658
I'm just saying that either you endure this...

24:54.726 --> 24:58.560
...and you live it out like you're
in some goddamn country western song...

24:58.797 --> 25:02.995
...or you take the kid,
you take Gracie and you get out.

25:11.776 --> 25:15.337
Mrs. Hiller, how are you? Your husband got her.

25:17.716 --> 25:18.944
I must've forgotten.

25:19.017 --> 25:22.282
Gracie was totally psyched.
I told him he should do it more often.

25:37.869 --> 25:38.858
Mitch!

25:40.372 --> 25:41.634
Toots!

25:44.376 --> 25:45.365
Gracie!

26:12.637 --> 26:14.502
Is that my little croissant?

26:14.873 --> 26:16.534
No, it's your loaf of bread.

26:17.042 --> 26:18.509
Oh, hi. How is it going?

26:20.845 --> 26:23.211
-Where are you?
-Zoo.

26:24.716 --> 26:27.981
-Why didn't you tell me--
-I called you at home, left messages.

26:28.420 --> 26:29.409
Hey, Daddy.

26:29.955 --> 26:31.786
-Come here.
-It's your mom, honey.

26:31.856 --> 26:34.381
Mom, the elephants are peeing.

26:34.826 --> 26:36.350
She's a little excited.

26:36.895 --> 26:40.922
Hey, Dad, here. Come here. Look at the giraffe.

26:43.268 --> 26:46.726
So, when are you guys going to be home?

26:47.005 --> 26:51.533
I don't know. I'll take her for a pony ride,
maybe get a cotton candy.

26:52.177 --> 26:54.111
You want a cotton candy, honey?

26:55.046 --> 26:56.877
-I'll see you later.
-'Bye, Mommy.

27:06.191 --> 27:09.058
Made me nervous
when I couldn't reach you today.

27:14.633 --> 27:17.227
I thought you were going to cancel
with my mother.

27:21.006 --> 27:24.066
And you have to go crying to the old gang
at the greasy spoon.

27:26.311 --> 27:28.006
Whatever happened to privacy?

27:29.881 --> 27:33.146
I guess it's dead, along with chivalry and fidelity.

27:35.220 --> 27:36.380
Tell me.

27:37.555 --> 27:39.113
Do you have any idea...

27:39.691 --> 27:41.352
...how bad things can get?

27:43.662 --> 27:45.152
Educate me.

27:45.397 --> 27:49.458
Slim, I'm a determined man.
I was determined to have you, and I did.

27:50.869 --> 27:53.337
This house, my company....

27:55.106 --> 27:58.269
I am and always will be a person
who gets what he wants.

28:02.414 --> 28:04.075
And I still want you.

28:07.852 --> 28:09.786
You can either accept that...

28:10.321 --> 28:12.915
...or you can fight it.
Which way do you want to go?

28:15.527 --> 28:17.188
I want to be happy.

28:22.734 --> 28:23.894
Good.

28:41.119 --> 28:42.916
-Can I help you?
-Yeah.

28:43.621 --> 28:46.613
I have a friend whose husband beats her up.

28:47.358 --> 28:49.792
She should come in here and file a complaint.

28:50.128 --> 28:53.689
If she has physical evidence of abuse
on her person...

28:53.865 --> 28:55.594
...we'll go out and arrest him.

28:55.667 --> 28:59.603
-If he has money, he can bail himself out.
-That's true.

28:59.971 --> 29:03.771
-Then he's free till it goes to trial.
-If it goes to trial.

29:04.242 --> 29:07.302
It's up to the city's attorney's office
whether to prosecute.

29:07.378 --> 29:08.402
Okay, so...

29:08.913 --> 29:11.677
...she comes in here, she has him arrested...

29:12.150 --> 29:14.345
...and pisses him off...

29:14.486 --> 29:18.115
...then there's no guarantee
that he won't come after her once he's out.

29:18.223 --> 29:19.986
She could get a protection order.

29:20.058 --> 29:23.391
What's that? A little piece of paper
that says he can't come around?

29:24.229 --> 29:27.960
And when he comes around,
what does she do, throw it at him?

29:28.900 --> 29:29.992
She calls us.

29:33.438 --> 29:35.668
And what about the kid? ls the....

29:36.407 --> 29:40.343
-Is the paper good for the kid, too?
-There's a child involved?

29:41.546 --> 29:43.878
That's a matter for the family courts.

29:43.948 --> 29:47.179
But unless she can prove
that he's a danger to the child...

29:47.919 --> 29:51.446
...she can't legally bar him access. Miss! Miss!

31:17.909 --> 31:20.878
-Maybe she didn't hear the signal.
-No, she heard it.

31:20.979 --> 31:21.968
No.

31:24.048 --> 31:26.039
I think maybe Teddy is right.

32:05.523 --> 32:07.582
Maybe she could still be sleeping.

32:07.759 --> 32:10.922
She's not sleeping, okay, Phil?
She's coming any second.

32:25.977 --> 32:27.740
Okay, do it again.

32:55.106 --> 32:56.266
Put her down.

32:57.442 --> 32:58.909
We should go in.

33:00.244 --> 33:02.235
It'd be crazy if we woke him up.

33:03.748 --> 33:06.683
Plus, she's going to flick the lights
if anything is wrong.

33:06.751 --> 33:08.742
-Right?
-Yeah.

33:44.222 --> 33:46.019
Another step and you're dead.

33:50.628 --> 33:52.562
Oh, my God!

33:56.567 --> 34:00.298
You don't understand.
You've broken into our house.

34:01.339 --> 34:02.601
She's alive.

34:02.673 --> 34:06.439
The lights are out. I can't see who you are.
I could kill you free and clear.

34:06.611 --> 34:07.543
Sir, please.

34:11.081 --> 34:13.550
-Where's Gracie?
-She's here.

34:13.618 --> 34:17.418
We are happy to leave, Mitch,
with Slim and Miss Gracie.

34:18.056 --> 34:22.719
And make no mistake. If you keep them here,
we will go straight to the police...

34:23.094 --> 34:27.496
...who will surely arrest you
with a great deal of pleasure.

34:30.400 --> 34:32.995
I don't want to say this in front of the group...

34:34.304 --> 34:37.172
...but you are just a rug head.

34:37.708 --> 34:41.166
If you go to the cops,
it will be her word against mine.

34:41.679 --> 34:45.842
And they will find drugs in her bureau
or her car, or whatever.

34:46.150 --> 34:49.779
Trust me on that. I'll have custody of Gracie
by the end of the week.

34:50.288 --> 34:53.882
No. Help me. I got to get her out of here.

34:53.958 --> 34:56.391
Enough with her. Get out.

34:59.230 --> 35:03.530
Wake up, baby. Wake up. Look at your papa.

35:04.168 --> 35:07.331
We're going for a little ride. Look at your papa.

35:07.438 --> 35:09.702
Help them up. Get the bag.

35:12.110 --> 35:14.601
-Look at your papa.
-I'll see you soon.

35:15.880 --> 35:17.040
'Bye, sweetie.

35:24.122 --> 35:26.386
And she's tied up because...

35:27.225 --> 35:31.321
...once a mean guy got her, tied her up....

35:31.429 --> 35:33.056
Could be a broken rib.

35:33.264 --> 35:34.891
You could play with her ears.

35:35.600 --> 35:37.124
Flicks her ears out.

35:37.335 --> 35:39.269
At least it's not my face this time.

35:40.004 --> 35:41.130
Where are we going?

35:41.205 --> 35:42.832
-Hospital.
-No.

35:44.075 --> 35:46.043
-I'm fine.
-You are not.

35:46.310 --> 35:47.777
-Where to, Phil?
-Hospital.

35:47.845 --> 35:52.509
I don't want to take her to the ER
in the middle of the night.

35:53.251 --> 35:56.516
She needs someplace safe where she can sleep.

35:56.587 --> 35:58.555
We could go to my house.

35:59.023 --> 36:00.991
No. He knows where you live.

36:02.627 --> 36:04.527
He knows where we all live.

36:05.530 --> 36:06.622
Yeah.

36:25.416 --> 36:29.443
-One queen-size bed is all right?
-Yeah, it's just me and my daughter.

36:31.822 --> 36:36.225
I'm sorry. This card has been refused.
Would you like to try another?

36:48.940 --> 36:52.876
I'm sorry, Mrs. Hiller.
The funds in your account seem to be frozen.

37:04.255 --> 37:06.746
-I love motels.
-Me, too.

37:06.924 --> 37:09.484
-Hotels, too.
-Yeah, more potato.

37:10.428 --> 37:14.057
-I'm going to bounce on the bed.
-Okay, toots. Be careful.

37:15.733 --> 37:17.496
-Hello.
-Hey, there.

37:18.869 --> 37:20.200
-Not too high.
-What?

37:20.271 --> 37:21.636
I'm talking to Gracie.

37:23.074 --> 37:25.838
We're watching some TV,
getting ready to hit the sack.

37:26.077 --> 37:27.669
Look, Mom.

37:29.680 --> 37:34.014
-What about what we talked about?
-No. No shelters.

37:35.286 --> 37:38.653
She hasn't been tainted by anything so far...

37:39.223 --> 37:43.592
-...and I want to keep it that way.
-Okay. I understand.

37:43.661 --> 37:46.789
-Can we talk about this tomorrow?
-Piece of cake.

37:46.964 --> 37:48.898
Piece of pie. 'Bye.

37:52.136 --> 37:54.104
Come on, toots. Ready for bed.

37:55.039 --> 37:59.271
What's "tainted"? ls that like "painted"?

38:04.715 --> 38:09.175
-Gin, I said tomorrow, okay?
-Not exactly the Biltmore, is it?

38:11.188 --> 38:14.624
It's the information age, sweetheart.
You leave a trail everywhere.

38:14.725 --> 38:18.126
Especially when your best friend
rents your room with her credit card.

38:18.195 --> 38:21.926
I had to do that since someone froze
all my accounts, right?

38:22.266 --> 38:24.700
-We need to talk.
-No, we don't.

38:24.969 --> 38:25.958
Please.

38:26.504 --> 38:29.064
If we do this the hard way,
you know who will suffer.

38:29.140 --> 38:32.109
I'm not talking about you, honey.
I mean Gracie.

38:32.276 --> 38:36.406
You don't want her touched or affected
by something bad or undesirable.

38:36.480 --> 38:38.971
-What?
-"Tainted, " right?

38:45.756 --> 38:47.314
That's what tainted means.

38:58.736 --> 39:01.967
-Who's banging on the door?
-I don't know.

39:02.239 --> 39:03.934
Why? What's going on?

39:05.176 --> 39:08.373
-Mom, I'm scared.
-It will be okay, baby.

39:22.026 --> 39:23.015
Slim!

39:28.232 --> 39:29.392
Hold the bus!

39:30.968 --> 39:31.957
Hold the bus!

39:39.276 --> 39:40.743
Go, go, go!

39:43.881 --> 39:45.610
Open the door. Open it.

39:57.528 --> 39:59.018
Los Angeles-Seattle?

39:59.096 --> 40:03.795
That fare is $409 round trip.
How would you like to pay for that?

40:05.069 --> 40:06.297
Cash.

40:13.277 --> 40:17.509
I always thought you'd come back here with me,
but not eight years later.

40:17.581 --> 40:20.482
Well, if I had known how pretty it was....

40:20.918 --> 40:23.716
This place really sparkles!

40:23.788 --> 40:26.450
You know what they call it? The Emerald City.

40:27.291 --> 40:29.782
Isn't that where Dorothy is?

40:30.428 --> 40:33.795
No, sweetie,
that's where Dorothy goes in her dream.

40:35.433 --> 40:37.958
Where is she when she wakes up?

40:39.103 --> 40:40.593
Back in Kansas.

40:41.839 --> 40:45.172
-All right, game time. Duck your heads.
-Pigeon poop.

41:06.263 --> 41:07.890
Why did you come to me?

41:09.266 --> 41:12.064
I tried to think of the last time that I felt safe.

41:13.838 --> 41:15.396
Then I saw your face.

41:18.542 --> 41:20.442
And, I wanted a place that...

41:21.345 --> 41:23.404
...M-l-T-C-H wouldn't think of.

41:23.814 --> 41:27.045
-And someone who was stupid enough to do it.
-Yeah.

41:32.022 --> 41:34.490
-Anybody here like hot fudge sundaes?
-Yeah.

41:35.993 --> 41:36.982
I do. I do.

41:58.415 --> 41:59.404
Yeah.

41:59.917 --> 42:03.284
-FBl. Can we talk?
-Go ahead.

42:03.454 --> 42:07.015
Would you mind opening up?
I'm investigating a kidnapping.

42:07.091 --> 42:08.683
I'd like to look around.

42:13.764 --> 42:14.992
You got a warrant?

42:26.210 --> 42:29.111
-You letting us in or not?
-Hold on a second.

42:37.555 --> 42:38.988
Can I see the warrant?

42:52.903 --> 42:54.234
Watch the front.

42:57.207 --> 42:58.640
Who are you looking for?

43:15.826 --> 43:18.920
Mister, unless you leave right now,
I'm calling the police.

43:19.163 --> 43:21.597
Jeez, that's a scary thought.

43:26.103 --> 43:28.867
I married a cop.
I don't need their bullshit right now.

44:06.210 --> 44:08.974
That's enough. Do you hear me?
It's time to go. Now!

44:11.949 --> 44:14.816
You're not FBl, okay. I know who hired you.

44:16.120 --> 44:19.112
Do you know what it's like
to have a knife hit your carotid?

44:19.189 --> 44:20.281
No.

44:21.892 --> 44:24.918
Do you know what it's like to die
because you're really stupid?

44:24.995 --> 44:26.963
No, I really don't.

44:27.498 --> 44:28.522
John boy.

44:29.433 --> 44:31.492
This is not listed on the program.

44:32.136 --> 44:34.036
They're not here. Let's ride.

44:34.104 --> 44:35.366
-Can't I just--
-No!

44:36.807 --> 44:38.502
Not today.

44:48.719 --> 44:49.777
Your phone.

44:51.622 --> 44:52.919
'Night, John boy.

45:31.061 --> 45:33.962
-Are you okay?
-I'm fine. I needed a shave anyway.

45:34.031 --> 45:35.089
I'm sorry.

45:36.066 --> 45:38.091
-I shouldn't be here.
-Sure you should.

45:38.168 --> 45:39.032
No.

45:39.536 --> 45:43.996
-I can't keep putting people I love in danger.
-What danger? They killed my sofa.

45:52.282 --> 45:54.910
-Hello.
-Joe. This is Mitch Hiller.

45:56.019 --> 45:57.008
It's him.

45:58.155 --> 46:01.090
Hello. How are you?

46:01.959 --> 46:04.086
I assume Slim's called you?

46:05.062 --> 46:06.393
Yeah. Of course.

46:06.730 --> 46:08.527
Could you give her a message?

46:09.166 --> 46:12.033
-If she calls back again, I mean?
-I don't know.

46:12.636 --> 46:14.570
I'm on her side, not yours.

46:15.439 --> 46:16.428
Her side.

46:17.207 --> 46:19.232
What did you expect, Mitch? Really?

46:20.110 --> 46:22.169
Come on, Joe. You're a smart guy.

46:23.514 --> 46:25.505
Let me say two words to you, okay?

46:26.617 --> 46:27.413
Lug nuts.

46:28.285 --> 46:31.948
You don't want to worry they are loose
every time you pull on the freeway.

46:32.523 --> 46:35.788
How about the windows in your apartment?
Are they still locked?

46:36.293 --> 46:38.887
Person could go crazy
thinking about stuff like that.

46:47.137 --> 46:51.369
-You think those thugs are coming back?
-It doesn't make any difference.

46:51.441 --> 46:52.908
Sure it does.

46:53.544 --> 46:56.638
You don't have to go.
They're not coming back tonight.

46:57.281 --> 47:00.216
You know that it is not safe for you
if I stay here.

47:00.617 --> 47:05.145
You can come back any time.
Tomorrow, the next day.

47:08.325 --> 47:10.555
Maybe I'll take you up on that one day.

47:12.663 --> 47:15.461
Where will you go? What will you do?

47:31.381 --> 47:35.715
Jupiter, girl out there says she's your daughter.
She insists on seeing you.

47:41.358 --> 47:45.226
She can't possibly be my daughter.
I haven't had sex since 1995.

47:45.729 --> 47:47.629
Not in this country, at least.

47:48.532 --> 47:50.693
Not her. Me.

47:51.468 --> 47:52.992
I'm your daughter.

47:56.974 --> 48:00.671
-What year were you born?
-You are my father, Jupiter.

48:01.245 --> 48:05.409
I wrote you, like, 20 times.
But even when Mom died you didn't answer.

48:05.949 --> 48:10.249
-I didn't have enough money to bury her.
-Don't blame me. I didn't kill her.

48:10.921 --> 48:12.047
No. You had help.

48:13.290 --> 48:15.383
That's a stupid thing to say.

48:16.693 --> 48:18.820
What do you want? Money?

48:20.530 --> 48:22.589
I wanted Gracie to meet her grandpa.

48:25.669 --> 48:26.658
Hi.

48:31.475 --> 48:34.000
And, yes, we need money to survive.

48:35.078 --> 48:36.170
Look, sweetheart...

48:36.513 --> 48:40.449
...from 1968-1972, I had five kids. Maybe more.

48:41.351 --> 48:45.515
Half the people in that room could be my kid.
It's a running joke around here.

48:45.889 --> 48:50.189
How will you feel when you wake up one day
and find out your daughter is dead?

48:50.861 --> 48:52.726
And you didn't do anything to help?

48:55.299 --> 48:57.665
You're good. The kid's a sweet touch, too.

48:58.502 --> 49:02.336
But you're not the first to think of this gig
since that Fortune article.

49:02.739 --> 49:06.368
So I'll give you the same thing
I gave the other three.

49:06.543 --> 49:11.105
$6. Enough to buy a sandwich.
But for you, I'll make it $12.

49:12.749 --> 49:14.944
Make sure you buy the kid a sandwich, too.

49:17.521 --> 49:21.116
I believe this originally belonged to you.

49:21.925 --> 49:25.417
Pawn it, since you're so hard up.
I'm sure it's worth more than $12.

49:52.089 --> 49:54.319
Mommy, don't cry.

49:55.392 --> 49:56.723
Please don't cry.

50:24.254 --> 50:25.585
Mommy!

50:38.402 --> 50:39.733
This way.

50:55.619 --> 50:58.247
I'm sorry. This is the best we can do.

50:58.422 --> 51:00.890
It's okay. We're fine. Thanks.

51:02.025 --> 51:03.925
Who are all these people?

51:07.597 --> 51:10.760
They're kind of friends of friends of Phil.

51:21.511 --> 51:23.172
What is it?

51:25.015 --> 51:26.846
It's food, okay?

51:45.001 --> 51:47.469
Hi, I lost my birth certificate.

52:04.054 --> 52:06.284
This is for you. Phil sent it.

52:07.657 --> 52:09.852
Are you surprised?

52:10.794 --> 52:13.422
Sure, we take care of you. All right?

52:15.232 --> 52:16.529
Dear Slim:

52:17.400 --> 52:21.200
Yesterday three men threatened to kill me
if I helped you in any way.

52:21.972 --> 52:25.305
Fortunately for you, this aroused my interest.

52:25.742 --> 52:27.107
But she may also be....

52:27.177 --> 52:30.544
I'm sending this to an old address,
the diner where you worked.

52:30.914 --> 52:33.644
If this reaches you and you need more...

52:33.884 --> 52:37.183
...leave word at my office. Jupiter.

53:26.369 --> 53:29.167
What do we think? We like it here?

53:29.773 --> 53:33.834
-Why? Are we moving again?
-No. We just--

53:33.977 --> 53:35.103
Good.

53:35.178 --> 53:39.308
Because I'm sick and tired to death of moving.

53:40.684 --> 53:42.549
Me, too. So here's the deal.

53:42.619 --> 53:47.249
You can call me Mom or you can call me Erin,
but you cannot call me Slim.

53:48.124 --> 53:50.115
I never call you Slim.

53:50.427 --> 53:53.191
I know, but just in case
somebody asks you someday--

53:53.296 --> 53:55.264
I don't think you are that slim.

53:56.499 --> 53:57.796
Thanks a lot.

54:00.704 --> 54:04.902
-Do I get a new name, too?
-I guess. If you want one.

54:06.076 --> 54:07.373
-Excuse me!
-Yes?

54:07.644 --> 54:09.805
-Hi. Betty?
-Yes?

54:10.213 --> 54:13.671
-I'm Erin Shleeter. I called you.
-Yes, I remember.

54:13.750 --> 54:15.377
This is my daughter.

54:16.319 --> 54:19.516
Look at you. You are so.... What's your name?

54:19.990 --> 54:21.321
Queen Elizabeth.

54:23.159 --> 54:26.822
Welcome, Queen Elizabeth.
You'll have a good time here.

54:26.896 --> 54:28.693
May I call you "Queen" for short?

54:30.734 --> 54:34.568
I like talking to Grandma, but every Sunday...

54:34.971 --> 54:38.737
...do we have to drive for 55 hours...

54:39.042 --> 54:41.806
...just to reach some phone booth?

54:43.013 --> 54:46.073
-Can I call Daddy this time?
-No.

54:46.149 --> 54:49.016
Please? Please?

54:49.286 --> 54:51.015
Don't beg. You look like a dog.

54:55.992 --> 54:59.291
You know he has friends
in the police department...

54:59.362 --> 55:03.628
...and you're depriving him of his rights
as a father, nonsense like that.

55:03.800 --> 55:06.394
It's leading up to a big custody hearing.

55:06.469 --> 55:07.868
What are you saying?

55:07.937 --> 55:12.033
Talk to him. Calm him down.
Call him before he does something stupid.

55:12.108 --> 55:14.736
It might help if he talked to Gracie...

55:15.245 --> 55:20.148
...for her sake, too.
It's not healthy to be without a father.

55:21.418 --> 55:24.114
We better keep this short. I'll call you next week.

55:24.187 --> 55:26.553
Wait. I want to speak to Gracie--

55:35.832 --> 55:39.233
Hi, Daddy. We're having a great vacation.

55:39.536 --> 55:40.525
Where?

55:40.737 --> 55:44.229
We've been everywhere. Chicago and--

55:44.641 --> 55:47.109
No questions, okay? Or it ends now.

55:48.445 --> 55:52.711
Listen, bitch. She's my daughter, too.
Don't tell me how I can talk to her.

55:53.049 --> 55:56.712
Put me back on the phone with Gracie.
Give her the damn phone.

55:57.087 --> 55:59.749
Tell Daddy that you love him and say goodbye.

56:02.158 --> 56:05.321
Gracie, you there, honey? Sweetheart, talk to me.

56:05.395 --> 56:06.327
'Bye, Daddy.

56:06.396 --> 56:09.729
Honey, I'm sorry, baby.
Daddy didn't mean to use bad words.

56:09.866 --> 56:12.061
-I'm really, really sad.
-Graciel

56:16.506 --> 56:18.997
I'm sorry, kid. It was my mistake.

56:22.912 --> 56:24.777
Mommy's just a big dummy.

56:30.854 --> 56:32.082
What do you think?

56:35.258 --> 56:38.386
-Her voice?
-Yeah, she sounds the same.

56:38.528 --> 56:41.656
Good. 'Cause if she's changed her appearance--

56:41.731 --> 56:43.164
Thanks, John.

56:45.835 --> 56:49.134
I remember her. I told you.
The diner. The scam.

56:49.773 --> 56:53.265
I don't remember why you broke the rules
and decided to marry the bitch.

56:53.543 --> 56:55.101
She's not a bitch.

56:56.146 --> 56:57.272
Sorry.

56:59.149 --> 57:00.639
She is a waitress.

57:02.285 --> 57:04.719
-What does that mean?
-Means she's stupid.

57:05.522 --> 57:08.514
-Call your mother. Now to call you.
-She's not stupid.

57:08.591 --> 57:12.391
She thinks if the calls are short
they can't be traced.

57:12.462 --> 57:16.626
I still want to know.
With all the girls that we pulled that on, why her?

57:17.634 --> 57:18.965
Maybe it's love.

57:20.069 --> 57:21.001
Yeah.

57:21.070 --> 57:25.234
I know what that means.
If you were smart, you'd forget her.

57:25.375 --> 57:29.072
I can't simply forget her. She kidnapped my kid.

57:29.612 --> 57:33.446
How many times do I have to go there?
It's not kidnapping.

57:34.484 --> 57:37.578
Kidnapping is when someone
who isn't the mother takes the kid.

57:37.654 --> 57:40.282
When the mother takes the kid,
it's called parenting.

57:40.423 --> 57:42.050
How soon can you get there?

57:43.259 --> 57:46.956
I don't know.
You know, I could lose my job for this.

57:47.330 --> 57:48.319
Robbie...

57:49.432 --> 57:53.892
...you could lose your job for all the jobs
you're doing besides doing your job.

57:54.437 --> 57:56.928
-You know what I mean?
-You got to be reasonable.

58:00.810 --> 58:03.973
-I know some guys in Detroit.
-Like your guys in Seattle?

58:04.280 --> 58:06.475
I don't think so. I know what they're like.

58:06.649 --> 58:08.844
They've never met her, never heard her voice.

58:09.285 --> 58:11.810
She'll spot them and run
before they even see her.

58:13.623 --> 58:15.056
It's you, Robbie.

58:16.125 --> 58:17.092
It's you...

58:18.194 --> 58:19.525
...or it's you.

58:24.067 --> 58:26.501
What do you think? ls it okay?

58:26.669 --> 58:27.829
It's okay, right?

58:29.906 --> 58:31.635
No, it's not. It's horrible.

58:32.242 --> 58:34.472
It's not horrible, Mom.

58:34.644 --> 58:37.238
Yeah, but it's not good, is it?

58:37.447 --> 58:39.972
Mom, you tasted it.

59:02.372 --> 59:04.306
You know what I think?

59:07.577 --> 59:08.908
No, what's that?

59:09.412 --> 59:11.676
I think you miss Daddy.

59:14.651 --> 59:16.346
Daddy yells at me, toots.

59:16.953 --> 59:19.547
Well, you miss somebody.

59:35.405 --> 59:36.770
There he is.

59:37.774 --> 59:39.298
Joe! Joe!

59:39.542 --> 59:40.770
-Joe!
-Joe!

59:42.145 --> 59:44.443
Joe! Joe, over here!

59:46.482 --> 59:48.882
Hey! How are you?

59:53.022 --> 59:57.015
You're lucky I like you.
This is the most preposterous trip I've ever taken.

59:57.460 --> 59:59.519
Change your plane. Rent a car.

01:00:03.132 --> 01:00:04.121
Let's do it.

01:00:22.819 --> 01:00:25.083
You guys hungry as I am?

01:00:42.171 --> 01:00:44.503
-Seems like she's doing great.
-Yeah.

01:00:45.408 --> 01:00:47.000
How about you? You okay?

01:00:47.343 --> 01:00:50.005
Cut off from everybody,
can't talk to your friends....

01:00:50.813 --> 01:00:52.041
Gracie is safe.

01:00:54.283 --> 01:00:55.545
So Mitch is....

01:00:57.220 --> 01:01:00.087
-When is this custody thing?
-Couple of months.

01:01:01.858 --> 01:01:03.849
Anyway, they favor the mother, so....

01:01:05.561 --> 01:01:06.892
Yeah, they do.

01:01:07.530 --> 01:01:10.727
But he has a lot of money, and a lot of lawyers.

01:01:11.467 --> 01:01:15.403
That's kind of what I mean.
I mean, you can't run forever, Slim.

01:01:17.006 --> 01:01:18.735
Why not? I'm good at it.

01:01:18.975 --> 01:01:22.911
You are. But, then again,
you're good at everything.

01:01:31.287 --> 01:01:36.020
Wait, I'm confused.
Are you criticizing me or flirting with me?

01:01:36.726 --> 01:01:38.523
Let me get back to you on that.

01:01:40.163 --> 01:01:43.655
-Hi, Gracie. Is that your ball?
-Yes.

01:01:46.703 --> 01:01:48.227
You want to see a trick?

01:01:49.572 --> 01:01:50.698
Yeah.

01:01:53.643 --> 01:01:55.804
I don't hear the basketball. Do you?

01:01:57.346 --> 01:01:58.643
She was just....

01:01:59.615 --> 01:02:00.604
Gracie!

01:02:02.785 --> 01:02:03.774
Gracie!

01:02:05.988 --> 01:02:07.853
Gracie! I mean, Queen!

01:02:08.357 --> 01:02:11.292
Mommy! Mommy! Watch my new trick!

01:02:14.330 --> 01:02:16.389
Didn't I tell you to stay close?

01:02:18.634 --> 01:02:19.623
Come on.

01:02:46.796 --> 01:02:48.730
Do you remember the house rules?

01:02:50.933 --> 01:02:53.424
Who can forget, with Gracie here?

01:03:05.481 --> 01:03:06.470
Joe.

01:03:09.652 --> 01:03:11.950
-What would have happened if we--
-Don't.

01:03:14.390 --> 01:03:16.051
It's wrong to think like that.

01:03:17.226 --> 01:03:19.387
-Why?
-Because of Gracie.

01:03:20.863 --> 01:03:22.854
She's truly a great kid.

01:03:23.232 --> 01:03:26.292
Any path that doesn't include her
doesn't make any sense.

01:03:28.237 --> 01:03:30.569
Ginny told me about that weekend.

01:03:32.408 --> 01:03:34.103
Of your wedding?

01:03:36.512 --> 01:03:38.537
Did she tell you how terrible I was?

01:03:38.681 --> 01:03:43.311
Joe, that might work with other people,
but you forget. I've had you.

01:03:45.288 --> 01:03:46.915
I didn't forget.

01:03:48.291 --> 01:03:51.624
And I'm telling you from experience...

01:03:53.062 --> 01:03:54.495
...you're not that bad.

01:03:59.735 --> 01:04:02.670
-Do you have to go tomorrow?
-Yeah.

01:04:03.372 --> 01:04:07.308
Why? Why can't you quit your job
and come here...

01:04:07.810 --> 01:04:11.337
...and play the horses,
and become independently wealthy?

01:04:13.749 --> 01:04:15.478
Please, kiss me, Slim.

01:04:15.852 --> 01:04:18.548
I know we're not supposed to,
and it's against house rules.

01:04:18.621 --> 01:04:21.920
But for me to come all this way
and feel the way I do--

01:04:46.349 --> 01:04:48.180
You're a great person, Slim.

01:04:49.585 --> 01:04:51.951
You're a great person. Just like your daughter.

01:05:13.809 --> 01:05:15.538
Can I get a chocolate kiss?

01:05:17.413 --> 01:05:20.348
-Who wants to put two eggs in.
-I want to put the eggs.

01:05:21.684 --> 01:05:22.446
Careful.

01:08:17.593 --> 01:08:19.254
I want you back.

01:08:20.496 --> 01:08:21.484
No.

01:08:21.564 --> 01:08:23.691
-It could be just like it was.
-No!

01:08:26.836 --> 01:08:29.202
That's pretty stupid. You know why?

01:08:30.706 --> 01:08:33.004
Because if I can't have you, nobody will.

01:08:36.278 --> 01:08:39.839
Like that jerk who was here with you.
He'll be fishing for his guts.

01:08:40.549 --> 01:08:43.518
You know what else?
For murder, they need a body.

01:08:43.986 --> 01:08:46.420
Otherwise, they'll think you ran away again.

01:08:47.223 --> 01:08:49.316
Only this time, you'll never come back.

01:08:51.627 --> 01:08:52.616
Mommy!

01:08:53.828 --> 01:08:55.558
Daddy, no!

01:08:55.764 --> 01:08:57.698
Stop, Daddy! Stop it!

01:08:58.267 --> 01:08:59.256
Mommy!

01:08:59.468 --> 01:09:01.435
Stop, Daddy! Stop!

01:09:25.761 --> 01:09:29.697
Go on, honey. Get in your seat.
Get in the back. Strap yourself in.

01:10:02.565 --> 01:10:03.589
Put that on.

01:10:04.300 --> 01:10:05.824
Mommy, what's happening?

01:10:07.002 --> 01:10:09.129
Put it on. Put these on, too.

01:10:14.777 --> 01:10:15.539
You.

01:10:30.259 --> 01:10:31.419
Car seat, honey.

01:10:32.094 --> 01:10:35.188
-Then slow so I can.
-I can't slow down right now.

01:11:20.409 --> 01:11:21.171
Bitch!

01:11:33.455 --> 01:11:34.387
Pull over.

01:11:35.557 --> 01:11:37.184
Pull the car over!

01:11:37.760 --> 01:11:39.250
Mommy, stop it!

01:11:39.828 --> 01:11:40.988
Hold on tight.

01:11:44.433 --> 01:11:45.457
Pull over.

01:11:50.806 --> 01:11:51.465
Shit!

01:11:58.080 --> 01:11:59.069
Come on.

01:12:01.517 --> 01:12:03.985
-Mommy!
-Hold on, Gracie, okay.

01:12:07.890 --> 01:12:08.879
Mommy!

01:12:15.831 --> 01:12:16.559
Come on!

01:12:19.702 --> 01:12:23.229
It will be over soon. We're almost there!
Just hold on, okay?

01:13:29.171 --> 01:13:32.504
You'll be all right, okay? All right.

01:14:03.539 --> 01:14:04.836
Okay, toots.

01:14:05.841 --> 01:14:07.035
Let's talk.

01:14:10.512 --> 01:14:12.639
You want me to tell you what happened?

01:14:14.049 --> 01:14:15.243
Fair enough.

01:14:15.951 --> 01:14:17.316
First thing...

01:14:18.687 --> 01:14:20.052
...Erin is over.

01:14:20.823 --> 01:14:22.256
I liked Erin.

01:14:23.625 --> 01:14:26.059
And you are not the Queen of England anymore.

01:14:27.596 --> 01:14:28.756
Okay?

01:14:35.537 --> 01:14:36.868
I'm hungry.

01:14:48.684 --> 01:14:51.084
-Is everything okay here?
-Yeah, thanks.

01:14:52.054 --> 01:14:54.579
Hey there, little cutie. What's your name?

01:14:55.357 --> 01:14:56.619
I don't know.

01:15:02.498 --> 01:15:04.932
Hey, Millie, 14 needs menus.

01:15:15.978 --> 01:15:17.172
Come on.

01:15:18.313 --> 01:15:22.374
You'll be okay? You're going to sit here,
be Mommy's good girl? Okay?

01:15:22.885 --> 01:15:26.048
All right. Don't talk to any strangers.
Be right back.

01:15:28.257 --> 01:15:30.452
-Is Mr. Toller with someone?
-No, but--

01:15:30.526 --> 01:15:33.188
Good. I'm not a crazy person. I swear.

01:15:33.262 --> 01:15:35.753
-Wait a minute. You can't--
-Don't call security.

01:15:35.831 --> 01:15:39.460
Hi, Mr. Toller. My name is Erin....
I mean, my name is Slim.

01:15:39.535 --> 01:15:43.938
I got your name from Millie.
Down at the diner, right down the block.

01:15:44.506 --> 01:15:46.064
The thing is....

01:15:46.675 --> 01:15:49.974
My husband keeps trying to kill me.
You know? See?

01:15:50.112 --> 01:15:53.206
I need someone to talk to who is smart.

01:15:53.448 --> 01:15:56.713
And I have money, you know.

01:15:57.653 --> 01:16:00.417
I have money. $500.

01:16:01.890 --> 01:16:05.155
And you can have it. You can have it all...

01:16:05.527 --> 01:16:07.688
...if you just listen to what....

01:16:09.097 --> 01:16:10.086
Two minutes.

01:16:12.067 --> 01:16:13.329
Please.

01:16:21.843 --> 01:16:23.140
Thanks.

01:16:23.579 --> 01:16:27.071
Small person. Can you watch her? Thank you.

01:16:31.153 --> 01:16:32.848
Pardon my French, dear, but...

01:16:33.555 --> 01:16:37.548
...l hope you got some pleasure from it
because you've really screwed yourself.

01:16:38.360 --> 01:16:41.887
You had two chances to go to the police,
file a complaint...

01:16:41.964 --> 01:16:43.955
...put his violence on record.

01:16:44.566 --> 01:16:45.931
You ignored them both.

01:16:46.735 --> 01:16:49.568
Which tells him to keep on coming
until he kills you.

01:16:50.906 --> 01:16:54.364
As for Gracie,
you're going to the custody hearing?

01:16:54.710 --> 01:16:55.506
Yes, sir.

01:16:55.744 --> 01:16:59.612
If you didn't, the judge would rule against you,
and you'd become a fugitive.

01:17:00.382 --> 01:17:04.944
Once you're there, your husband will,
as you say, portray you as a drug addict.

01:17:06.088 --> 01:17:09.421
For all I know, you are one.
You break in here uninvited.

01:17:10.258 --> 01:17:14.991
I'd say your attacker has a very good chance
of gaining sole custody.

01:17:15.864 --> 01:17:18.833
-If you don't mind, put this away.
-No, no. Take it.

01:17:19.334 --> 01:17:20.926
Is that it?

01:17:24.373 --> 01:17:25.704
You won't help me?

01:17:26.541 --> 01:17:28.475
That's what I'm telling you.

01:17:29.378 --> 01:17:30.504
It's too late.

01:17:35.450 --> 01:17:37.884
There isn't anybody who can help you.

01:17:42.624 --> 01:17:45.149
In good conscience, I should say...

01:17:45.227 --> 01:17:47.525
...the custody hearing is probably a trick.

01:17:48.397 --> 01:17:51.423
It's not about itself. It's a way to find you.

01:17:52.367 --> 01:17:56.997
A way to get you in a particular place and time
so his men can follow you...

01:17:57.172 --> 01:18:00.039
...and he can come to wherever you are...

01:18:01.777 --> 01:18:03.210
...and kill you.

01:18:10.986 --> 01:18:12.112
Okay.

01:18:19.628 --> 01:18:21.858
Now I got to make you a promise, Grace.

01:18:23.665 --> 01:18:25.656
Ever since you were born....

01:18:26.868 --> 01:18:31.271
One day I started thinking
of all the awful things that could happen.

01:18:32.808 --> 01:18:36.244
People who you'd love would die...

01:18:37.879 --> 01:18:40.245
...or leave you, or betray you...

01:18:42.517 --> 01:18:44.041
...and break your heart.

01:18:44.686 --> 01:18:47.348
Or a guy would hurt you in some way.

01:18:47.823 --> 01:18:50.189
And I thought to myself, if I could...

01:18:50.959 --> 01:18:53.689
...protect you from that, even once.

01:18:56.398 --> 01:18:57.831
If I could just...

01:18:59.367 --> 01:19:01.528
...absorb any of that myself.

01:19:16.752 --> 01:19:18.049
Here goes.

01:19:22.758 --> 01:19:26.285
Okay, you guys, keep up with me.
This is really busy here.

01:19:27.329 --> 01:19:29.456
Would you hold her hand, please?

01:19:31.266 --> 01:19:33.996
This is the most ridiculous thing I've ever done.

01:19:34.169 --> 01:19:38.333
-Oh, yeah? How about Horace?
-Okay, the second most.

01:19:38.874 --> 01:19:41.809
Rent a car, drive to Reno, then fly to San Jose.

01:19:42.844 --> 01:19:45.472
-Are you out of your mind?
-You noticed?

01:20:03.198 --> 01:20:04.187
Oh, my!

01:20:05.233 --> 01:20:08.634
What happened?
I thought I'm supposed to drive to Reno.

01:20:08.703 --> 01:20:10.762
I had to make sure you weren't followed.

01:20:11.840 --> 01:20:13.102
Okay.

01:20:13.875 --> 01:20:16.275
Hey, Graceland. How are you?

01:20:18.547 --> 01:20:20.276
Hey, Gracie! Over here!

01:20:24.319 --> 01:20:26.184
-Here are the tickets.
-Okay.

01:20:26.388 --> 01:20:29.448
Some cash and credit cards. It's on me.

01:20:30.125 --> 01:20:33.686
-Just don't call home. Or Phil's.
-Okay.

01:20:34.763 --> 01:20:37.630
Think of it as a paid vacation you never had.

01:20:41.203 --> 01:20:42.636
Hey, toots.

01:20:42.938 --> 01:20:44.565
You want to give Mommy a hug?

01:20:45.774 --> 01:20:47.002
Come here.

01:20:49.244 --> 01:20:51.405
Say goodbye to me. Okay?

01:20:53.181 --> 01:20:56.116
I'm going to miss you. It's just for a little while.

01:20:58.320 --> 01:20:59.480
A little kiss?

01:21:00.822 --> 01:21:02.915
Can I have a little smile before you go?

01:21:06.361 --> 01:21:07.350
Okay.

01:21:15.570 --> 01:21:17.868
Sweetie, why don't you sit up front, okay?

01:21:21.543 --> 01:21:23.010
Take care of her.

01:21:23.245 --> 01:21:24.735
Oh, honey.

01:21:27.215 --> 01:21:29.649
I don't want you to worry, okay?

01:21:29.718 --> 01:21:33.484
Eric will have her dribbling behind her back
the next time you see her.

01:21:34.356 --> 01:21:38.087
Thanks. I'm number 1 on the auto dialer.

01:21:38.860 --> 01:21:40.521
Call me, or I'll call you.

01:21:40.896 --> 01:21:43.660
All calls, 15 seconds or less.

01:21:46.067 --> 01:21:48.228
-Cake?
-Pie.

01:21:51.439 --> 01:21:52.963
Try to have fun.

01:21:54.242 --> 01:21:55.709
Hey, how long?

01:21:55.777 --> 01:21:58.473
The custody hearing is in the next month, so....

01:21:59.114 --> 01:22:01.605
-That's my deadline.
-Deadline for what?

01:22:17.332 --> 01:22:19.857
Relax. Close your eyes.

01:22:21.169 --> 01:22:24.138
I'm not here. He's not here.

01:22:27.442 --> 01:22:28.636
Time!

01:22:29.044 --> 01:22:31.877
Relax. Breathe. Close your eyes.

01:22:32.213 --> 01:22:35.011
Close your eyes. That's it. Go!

01:22:38.820 --> 01:22:40.811
Relax. Keep your balance.

01:22:40.889 --> 01:22:43.050
-You ready?
-Yes.

01:22:43.692 --> 01:22:44.886
You sure?

01:22:47.762 --> 01:22:50.390
-Can you lose?
-No.

01:22:51.333 --> 01:22:53.858
-Can he hurt you?
-No.

01:22:54.302 --> 01:22:57.169
-Even though he's bigger?
-He's a lot bigger.

01:22:57.405 --> 01:23:00.897
-Even though he's stronger?
-He's a lot stronger.

01:23:03.979 --> 01:23:07.039
Get some rest tonight.
Tomorrow we're gonna work on the ball.

01:23:12.153 --> 01:23:13.177
Look at me!

01:23:14.756 --> 01:23:16.417
-If he hits you....
-No way.

01:23:16.925 --> 01:23:17.949
Say it.

01:23:18.059 --> 01:23:21.893
It takes twice as much energy
to swing and miss as to swing and hit.

01:23:23.031 --> 01:23:26.592
You think you're done for.
He's got you by the throat. Left arm up.

01:23:26.968 --> 01:23:31.132
Good. Rotate around. Drop that arm.
Reach up, grab my hand.

01:23:31.206 --> 01:23:32.639
There. Good.

01:23:35.910 --> 01:23:37.172
So how do you win?

01:23:39.381 --> 01:23:40.507
How?

01:23:41.816 --> 01:23:43.215
I attack.

01:23:43.585 --> 01:23:47.214
-And what do you do after you attack?
-Nothing.

01:23:48.089 --> 01:23:49.386
Why nothing?

01:23:50.225 --> 01:23:52.386
Because I never stop attacking.

01:23:56.264 --> 01:23:57.356
Good! Do it!

01:23:57.432 --> 01:23:59.730
Use your legs. Keep that chin down!

01:24:00.435 --> 01:24:03.199
That's it! Go! Go!

01:24:06.608 --> 01:24:07.973
One last thing.

01:24:09.577 --> 01:24:11.169
The hardest lesson.

01:24:12.313 --> 01:24:14.713
We can't control the universe.

01:24:16.951 --> 01:24:18.441
Suddenly the maid enters.

01:24:18.520 --> 01:24:21.580
You're distracted for an instant and he hits you.

01:24:22.190 --> 01:24:23.623
That's not possible.

01:24:24.426 --> 01:24:28.385
To win, we must prepare,
even for the impossible.

01:24:29.531 --> 01:24:33.126
We bend the universe to our will,
but it will only go so far.

01:24:36.805 --> 01:24:38.796
-So you're saying....
-Yes.

01:24:44.112 --> 01:24:45.374
You're down.

01:24:46.481 --> 01:24:47.709
Lying there.

01:24:48.616 --> 01:24:50.083
Seemingly beaten.

01:24:53.822 --> 01:24:54.982
But hear me.

01:24:56.391 --> 01:24:57.790
Hold on to my voice.

01:24:59.961 --> 01:25:01.485
He's standing over you.

01:25:03.164 --> 01:25:04.688
He thinks he's won.

01:25:06.134 --> 01:25:09.661
And as sure as he's a coward,
he will try to kick you.

01:25:10.205 --> 01:25:11.331
Yes.

01:25:12.273 --> 01:25:14.468
But because you know what he'll do...

01:25:15.677 --> 01:25:17.838
...you're smiling inside.

01:25:25.854 --> 01:25:28.550
-How's that guy I set you up with?
-He's good.

01:25:29.357 --> 01:25:32.019
-He teach you how to think?
-I hope so.

01:25:33.862 --> 01:25:35.352
Did you find Mitch?

01:25:35.430 --> 01:25:38.490
He sold the house.
Bought a place out near the marina.

01:25:38.933 --> 01:25:42.835
I need a woman who looks like me.
5'5", 115 pounds.

01:25:42.904 --> 01:25:46.840
An off-duty cop or something.
She should have her hair cut short, too.

01:25:46.941 --> 01:25:49.933
-She should wear jeans and sneakers.
-Here's his address.

01:25:50.011 --> 01:25:52.479
I got her a room at the Washington Square lnn.

01:25:53.014 --> 01:25:54.106
What's she for?

01:25:54.182 --> 01:25:56.810
I need Mitch to think I'm here, in San Francisco.

01:25:57.352 --> 01:26:00.378
Have her meet me, 5:45,
top floor of the Vesuvio's.

01:26:00.622 --> 01:26:04.456
Today? Well, that's awful short notice.
I don't know--

01:26:04.526 --> 01:26:09.463
I thought Jupiter was almighty,
powerful, king of the gods.

01:26:12.967 --> 01:26:14.958
Yeah. One more thing.

01:26:15.537 --> 01:26:18.597
At some point,
not right now because it would be phony...

01:26:18.706 --> 01:26:20.867
...l need you to acknowledge I'm your kid.

01:26:31.352 --> 01:26:33.820
-You sure this will work?
-You bet your life.

01:26:36.124 --> 01:26:38.092
Thanks. I will.

01:26:39.360 --> 01:26:43.194
-And where is Gracie?
-Well, she gets back the day after tomorrow.

01:26:43.364 --> 01:26:45.229
And then we're gonna fly to LA.

01:26:45.400 --> 01:26:49.166
Tell me something, please.
Why is this call different?

01:26:49.337 --> 01:26:52.704
Well, you know, we were in the country then.

01:26:52.774 --> 01:26:55.766
Now we're in the city, meeting with my lawyers.

01:26:55.843 --> 01:26:58.334
So, you know, there's lots of cell phones here.

01:27:00.181 --> 01:27:02.479
So, there's no way they can trace this.

01:27:03.017 --> 01:27:05.315
Make sure you call me the minute you get back.

01:27:05.386 --> 01:27:07.445
I can't wait to see my girls, okay?

01:27:08.356 --> 01:27:10.347
Hey, give me the ball, man!

01:30:41.269 --> 01:30:45.171
-Coffee?
-No, I got to get home. Change for work.

01:30:46.307 --> 01:30:47.501
I'll call you.

01:30:49.444 --> 01:30:50.809
You want my number?

01:30:52.013 --> 01:30:53.173
Sure.

01:30:55.450 --> 01:30:58.283
-Thanks, for everything.
-You, too.

01:31:01.189 --> 01:31:02.850
I really appreciate it.

01:31:05.893 --> 01:31:06.985
Really.

01:31:14.101 --> 01:31:16.262
Lucy. Hey, baby.

01:31:18.139 --> 01:31:19.731
No, I had to work late.

01:31:23.978 --> 01:31:27.778
Tonight's no good. I have a flight
to San Francisco early tomorrow morning.

01:31:28.349 --> 01:31:30.715
If it was pleasure, you'd be going, too.

01:31:31.352 --> 01:31:34.082
No, I have to go up and pick up my daughter.

01:31:35.423 --> 01:31:37.653
Yeah, the custody hearing is down here.

01:31:37.992 --> 01:31:41.519
But it looks as if Gracie
is being taken to San Francisco...

01:31:42.663 --> 01:31:43.857
...and my wife...

01:31:43.931 --> 01:31:48.391
...it seems as if she has completely vanished.
Right off the face of the earth.

01:31:49.804 --> 01:31:51.999
I doubt they'll ever find her this time.

01:31:53.741 --> 01:31:57.973
I want her to meet you, too.
We'll call you as soon as we get back.

01:31:58.746 --> 01:32:00.111
Love you. 'Bye.

01:34:31.832 --> 01:34:34.357
-Hi. What's up?
-I'm in.

01:35:29.457 --> 01:35:32.051
Thanks for letting me come talk about Gracie.

01:35:32.393 --> 01:35:34.725
I'm glad you're willing to admit your temper.

01:35:34.995 --> 01:35:38.658
And let's not mince words.
The physical abuse you subjected me to.

01:35:39.200 --> 01:35:42.727
Perhaps with your new attitude,
we can really work something out.

01:35:43.370 --> 01:35:46.362
Per your last letter, I'll see you the evening of....

01:36:46.300 --> 01:36:48.461
Hey. You okay?

01:36:50.304 --> 01:36:51.293
Say it again.

01:36:52.139 --> 01:36:53.071
Say what?

01:36:53.808 --> 01:36:55.332
You know, what you told me.

01:36:56.710 --> 01:36:59.235
You have a divine, animal right...

01:36:59.547 --> 01:37:02.573
...to protect your own life
and the life of your offspring.

01:37:08.522 --> 01:37:09.784
Are you still there?

01:37:10.858 --> 01:37:11.847
Yeah.

01:37:13.494 --> 01:37:15.792
Stay on the line. I want to see if this works.

01:39:25.392 --> 01:39:26.689
It's me.

01:39:35.002 --> 01:39:35.991
Yeah.

01:39:37.271 --> 01:39:38.704
And this morning?

01:39:38.806 --> 01:39:41.366
You always did forget to turn off the coffee.

01:39:53.587 --> 01:39:55.418
I found it, Mitch.

01:40:31.225 --> 01:40:33.557
It's a machine. It knocks out cell phones.

01:40:50.144 --> 01:40:52.009
Found that gun, too.

01:40:54.581 --> 01:40:56.481
-Scared?
-Of what?

01:40:57.651 --> 01:40:59.642
Now is when you decide, Mitch.

01:41:00.888 --> 01:41:04.119
Whether you're a coward or not.
If you are, you can run.

01:41:04.458 --> 01:41:05.686
Go ahead, run.

01:41:05.826 --> 01:41:07.919
You will shoot me with my own gun?

01:41:08.695 --> 01:41:10.219
I threw them away.

01:41:12.266 --> 01:41:14.359
Then someone else is here with you.

01:41:16.370 --> 01:41:17.496
No.

01:41:19.406 --> 01:41:20.839
You're alone.

01:41:21.508 --> 01:41:22.770
Why not?

01:41:31.985 --> 01:41:33.953
This is what you wanted, right?

01:41:35.622 --> 01:41:37.988
What you were going to San Francisco for?

01:41:38.692 --> 01:41:40.284
The chance to get me alone?

01:41:40.961 --> 01:41:42.121
Yeah.

01:41:43.030 --> 01:41:44.622
But what are you doing?

01:41:49.269 --> 01:41:51.737
You want to fight me? Man to man?

01:41:53.073 --> 01:41:54.563
Woman, Mitch.

01:41:56.477 --> 01:41:58.968
Yeah, that's what I mean. Man against woman.

01:42:01.482 --> 01:42:03.416
You sure that's fair?

01:42:05.185 --> 01:42:06.447
Fair to whom?

01:42:09.323 --> 01:42:13.020
-No, I'm sorry. I can't do this.
-Can't do what?

01:42:13.260 --> 01:42:14.989
This. It's ridiculous.

01:42:15.896 --> 01:42:19.457
You could hit me before, though, couldn't you?
When I was defenseless.

01:42:23.937 --> 01:42:25.302
That's not going to--

01:42:30.210 --> 01:42:33.805
As I was saying, that's not going to do anything.

01:42:34.214 --> 01:42:35.681
Then what will do it?

01:42:35.949 --> 01:42:39.612
Are you such a coward that you can only hit me
when I'm not expecting it?

01:42:59.773 --> 01:43:00.535
Come on.

01:43:00.607 --> 01:43:03.201
I don't understand, Slim.
How does this work for you?

01:43:05.579 --> 01:43:07.740
I mean, this is carefully thought out.

01:43:08.482 --> 01:43:12.782
But say you do succeed. You beat me up
or whatever. You won't murder me.

01:43:16.924 --> 01:43:20.257
So all you've done is further piss me off.

01:43:27.501 --> 01:43:29.992
Self-defense is not murder.

01:43:31.972 --> 01:43:33.633
You don't have the guts.

01:43:40.113 --> 01:43:41.102
Come on.

01:43:41.648 --> 01:43:44.515
It's not self-defense
when you break in here and attack me.

01:43:44.585 --> 01:43:47.816
Attack you?
All I did was slap you around a little bit.

01:43:50.424 --> 01:43:53.621
You really think you're going to kill me
and get away with it?

01:43:57.598 --> 01:44:00.032
I told you. Self-defense.

01:44:01.068 --> 01:44:04.196
As arranged in our letters,
I'm here to talk about Gracie.

01:44:04.738 --> 01:44:06.171
There are no letters.

01:44:06.240 --> 01:44:08.902
Sure there are.
In the drawer where your pistol was.

01:44:13.347 --> 01:44:15.542
You just put your prints all over them.

01:44:16.049 --> 01:44:18.745
You attacked me, I fought back.

01:44:19.953 --> 01:44:21.716
If something should happen....

01:44:28.228 --> 01:44:31.959
I don't care how long it takes.
I only have to hit you once.

01:44:32.633 --> 01:44:35.534
Just one good hit and it's over.

01:44:47.614 --> 01:44:48.603
He bleeds.

01:44:48.782 --> 01:44:50.613
You can count on one thing, baby.

01:44:50.717 --> 01:44:54.016
Even if I don't kill you,
you'll never see Gracie again.

01:44:54.454 --> 01:44:55.682
You never will.

01:45:13.674 --> 01:45:16.336
I'm confused, Mitch. Aren't you a man?

01:45:17.711 --> 01:45:19.508
Can't you hit me again, even once?

01:45:36.630 --> 01:45:38.154
What do you think now?

01:45:38.598 --> 01:45:42.659
All your training, all your practice....
It's over, baby.

01:45:42.903 --> 01:45:43.801
It's over.

01:46:34.321 --> 01:46:36.255
-Hi.
-I can't do it, Gin.

01:46:36.390 --> 01:46:38.290
What do you mean? What happened?

01:46:39.192 --> 01:46:40.352
I can't do it.

01:46:40.660 --> 01:46:42.890
He'll come after you and after Gracie.

01:46:42.963 --> 01:46:46.194
I know all that, but I can't do it.

01:46:47.234 --> 01:46:49.429
I'm not a killer, Gin.

01:46:49.903 --> 01:46:52.872
I'm not him. I can't do this.

01:46:54.641 --> 01:46:58.304
Hello? Slim, are you there?
Should I call the cops?

01:46:58.612 --> 01:47:00.944
Slim, answer mel Sliml

01:47:03.083 --> 01:47:04.948
Hold on to my voice.

01:47:05.685 --> 01:47:07.346
He thinks he's won.

01:47:08.155 --> 01:47:11.682
And as sure as he's a coward,
he will try to kick you.

01:48:37.377 --> 01:48:39.504
Some woman called. Ginny?

01:48:42.949 --> 01:48:44.246
He's still in there?

01:48:46.253 --> 01:48:47.550
Armed?

01:48:48.622 --> 01:48:50.021
Dangerous?

01:49:01.468 --> 01:49:03.663
Looks like you're one of the lucky ones.

01:49:49.849 --> 01:49:50.838
Gracie!

01:49:53.286 --> 01:49:54.583
Mommy!

01:50:02.729 --> 01:50:03.491
My baby!

01:50:03.563 --> 01:50:06.054
Where are we going now, Mommy?

01:50:06.266 --> 01:50:07.699
Anywhere you want to go.

01:50:07.767 --> 01:50:09.462
Emerald City.

01:50:10.437 --> 01:50:12.632
I was thinking the same thing.

01:50:14.140 --> 01:50:18.577
-I have something to show you, Mommy.
-You do? Show me.

01:50:20.680 --> 01:50:22.739
Something for you.

01:50:27.253 --> 01:50:29.915
Oh, my goodness. Look at all this.

01:50:30.857 --> 01:50:32.848
Where did you get all this stuff?

01:50:34.894 --> 01:50:36.486
From Hawaii.
