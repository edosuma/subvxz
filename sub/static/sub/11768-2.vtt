TAKE HIM OR LEAVE HIM.

04:29.767 --> 04:31.133

HE'S A LITTLE STRANGE.

04:33.467 --> 04:34.900

04:39.400 --> 04:40.433
"OH, THIS IS HEAVEN."

04:40.467 --> 04:42.367
HAD TO TASTE
A CHOCOLATE BAR.

04:42.400 --> 04:44.067

04:50.533 --> 04:51.933
A LOT OF QUESTIONS,
YOU DIDN'T HEAR ANY OF THIS,

04:51.967 --> 04:53.300
BUT HE ASKED ME
A LOT OF QUESTIONS ABOUT

04:53.333 --> 04:55.067
MY PERSONAL HYGIENE, TOO.

04:55.067 --> 04:57.767
YEAH, YEAH, I'M NOT GONNA
EVEN TELL YOU WHAT THEY WERE,

04:57.800 --> 05:00.067

LIVING WITH TED DANSON.

05:11.300 --> 05:12.667

05:18.333 --> 05:20.333
BUT SHE REALLY HAS
AN INNER BEAUTY,

05:20.367 --> 05:21.700
DIDN'T YOU THINK ?

05:21.733 --> 05:23.267
AND IT JUST
KIND OF RADIATES ?

05:23.300 --> 05:24.533
MMM.

05:24.567 --> 05:25.800
YOU KNOW,
THE SHAME IS THAT

05:25.833 --> 05:27.933
I COULD NEVER BE FRIENDS
WITH HER, YOU KNOW ?

05:27.967 --> 05:30.067
WHY COULDN'T YOU BE
FRIENDS WITH HER ?

05:30.100 --> 05:32.067
WELL, BECAUSE,
UH, SHE'S A WOMAN.

05:32.067 --> 05:33.067
SHE'S MARRIED.

05:33.067 --> 05:35.067
I'M A MARRIED MAN.

05:35.067 --> 05:37.500
I'D LOVE TO JUST
HAVE A CUP OF COFFEE
WITH HER OR SOMETHING.

05:37.533 --> 05:38.767
BUT YOU CAN
NEVER DO THAT

05:38.800 --> 05:41.433
BECAUSE, WELL, SOCIETY
FROWNS ON RELATIONSHIPS

05:41.467 --> 05:44.067
BETWEEN MEN
AND WOMEN LIKE THAT.

05:44.067 --> 05:46.533
WELL, DON'T LET ME
STOP YOU, I MEAN...

05:46.567 --> 05:49.067
IF WE'RE GONNA BE
MAKING FRIENDS WITH THEM,

05:49.067 --> 05:51.500
I'D JUST AS SOON
BE FRIENDS WITH HER

05:51.533 --> 05:53.233
AND YOU CAN
BE FRIENDS WITH HIM.

05:53.267 --> 05:55.067
AND YOU COULD GET THE PERSONAL
HYGIENE QUESTIONS, OKAY ?

05:55.067 --> 05:56.967
ALRIGHT.

05:59.433 --> 06:01.533
AND THAT, HOW ABOUT
THAT CLINTON STUFF ?

06:01.567 --> 06:03.233
YEAH.

06:03.267 --> 06:05.767

I GOT THIS LAST WEEK.

08:27.067 --> 08:28.067

A MAN'S JACKET.

08:29.233 --> 08:31.100

08:32.733 --> 08:34.867
IT'S A HALF JACKET,
HALF SHIRT.

08:34.900 --> 08:36.067
YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT IT IS.

08:36.067 --> 08:37.367
I COULDN'T HELP,

08:55.533 --> 08:56.900
THIS IS INTERESTING,
ISN'T IT ?

08:56.933 --> 08:58.067
IT'S LIKE A SHIRT
AND A JACKET.

08:58.067 --> 08:59.067
I THINK IT'S ME.

08:59.100 --> 09:00.500
IT'S BEAUTIFUL ON YOU.

09:00.533 --> 09:02.167
YOU DON'T MIND THE TWO OF US
HAVING THE SAME COAT ?

09:02.200 --> 09:03.633

09:10.567 --> 09:12.467
MORE THAN LIKED,
I LOVED IT.

09:12.500 --> 09:15.467
ARE YOU SURE, 'CAUSE I COULDN'T
TELL WHEN I PUT IT ON.

09:15.500 --> 09:16.900
THERE WAS SOMETHING
IN YOUR EYES.

09:16.933 --> 09:18.833
OH, NO, NO, I THOUGHT
IT WAS PERFECT ON YOU.

09:18.867 --> 09:20.867
OH, LOOK AT THIS.

09:20.900 --> 09:22.900
SHOES.

09:22.933 --> 09:24.333
YOU KNOW WHAT ?

09:24.367 --> 09:26.633
I SHOULD REPLACE THE SHOES
FROM THE BOWLING ALLEY.

09:26.667 --> 09:28.833
MAYBE THEY'LL
HAVE THEM.

09:28.867 --> 09:30.833
I'M LOOKING FOR
A PAIR OF SHOES.

09:30.867 --> 09:32.900
UH, THEY'RE BROWN...

09:34.567 --> 09:37.333
OKAY, THEY LOOK LIKE
A SOCCER SHOE, ALMOST...

09:37.367 --> 09:39.367
YOU DON'T KNOW
THE BRAND NAME OF IT ?

09:39.400 --> 09:41.433
THEY GOT LIKE BLACK BUBBLES
ON THE BOTTOM.

09:41.467 --> 09:44.133
I BET YOU'RE TALKING
ABOUT CAMPERS.

09:44.167 --> 09:45.800
THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT THEY ARE.

09:45.833 --> 09:48.567
OKAY, OKAY, LET ME GO SEE
IF I CAN FIND THEM.

09:48.600 --> 09:49.867

WHAT ABOUT THAT BLUE SHIRT
I HAD WITH THE ZIPPERED--

09:53.500 --> 09:55.133
OH, LOVELY.

09:55.167 --> 09:56.800
YOU DON'T THINK THE SLEEVES
GO OUT TOO FAR ?

09:56.833 --> 09:59.167
NO, NO, YOU LOOK
SO BUFF IN IT.

09:59.200 --> 10:01.167
OH, NO, HONEY,
YOU'RE HANDSOME IN THAT.

10:01.200 --> 10:03.033

10:05.567 --> 10:08.300
OKAY, YEAH, UH,
I HOPE THAT YOU'RE A NINE.

10:08.333 --> 10:09.467
NO, I'M AN 11.

10:09.500 --> 10:11.333
OKAY.

10:11.367 --> 10:14.267
THIS IS, WE DON'T HAVE
IT IN ANYTHING,

10:14.300 --> 10:15.767
BUT A NINE RIGHT NOW.

10:15.800 --> 10:17.367
SO, I'D BE HAPPY
TO ORDER IT FOR YOU.

10:17.400 --> 10:18.967
IT WOULD TAKE
A COUPLE DAYS.

10:19.000 --> 10:20.467
IS THAT OKAY ?

10:20.500 --> 10:21.467
YEAH.

10:21.500 --> 10:22.733
UH, I'LL NEED
SOME INFORMATION FROM YOU.

10:31.267 --> 10:33.800

10:33.833 --> 10:36.133
HOW AMAZING WERE YOU

10:36.167 --> 10:38.167
I'M NEVER SEEN A MAN
TAKE TO SHOPPING

10:38.200 --> 10:40.633
THE WAY OUR LARRY
TOOK TO SHOPPING.

10:40.667 --> 10:42.700
I LOVE TO SHOP.

10:42.733 --> 10:44.133
I LOVE TO SHOP.

10:44.167 --> 10:45.767
I'VE NEVER KNOWN A MAN
WHO LOVED TO SHOP.

10:45.800 --> 10:47.200
YOU KNOW WHAT ?
I'M EXHAUSTED FROM PICKING UP--

10:47.233 --> 10:48.567
FROM THOSE
SHOPPING BAGS.

10:48.600 --> 10:49.900
I CAN'T EVEN
LIFT MY SANDWICH.

10:49.933 --> 10:51.967
YOUR WIFE MUST BE
VERY PROUD OF YOU.

10:52.000 --> 10:53.167
NO, SHE'S NOT.

10:53.200 --> 10:54.200
SHE'S NOT ?

10:54.233 --> 10:56.667
NOT EVEN A LITTLE BIT.

10:56.700 --> 10:59.000
OH, SHE IS, TOO.
CHERYL ADORES YOU.

10:59.033 --> 11:00.067
I LOVE TO SHOP,
YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE ?

11:00.100 --> 11:01.067
WHAT ?

11:01.100 --> 11:02.067
COOK.

11:02.100 --> 11:03.067
I SHOP AND I COOK.

11:03.100 --> 11:04.167
YOU DON'T COOK, LARRY.

11:04.200 --> 11:05.400
I'M THE DOUBLE HEADER.

11:05.433 --> 11:07.767
MARY, YOU SHOULD HAVE
MARRIED THIS MAN.

11:07.800 --> 11:08.900
LET ME TELL YOU
SOMETHING.

11:08.933 --> 11:10.467
NOTHING...

11:10.500 --> 11:12.967
NOTHING GIVES ME MORE PLEASURE
THAN CRACKING AN EGG.

11:13.067 --> 11:14.300
NOTHING.

11:14.333 --> 11:15.333
I'LL MAKE YOU
SOME OMELETS.

11:15.367 --> 11:16.733
I'LL FLIP YOU OUT.

11:16.767 --> 11:18.500
I WILL FLIP YOU OUT.

11:18.533 --> 11:19.500
YOU COOK ?

11:19.533 --> 11:21.733
THAT IS SO SEXY.

11:21.767 --> 11:22.867
MARY !

11:22.900 --> 11:23.933
WELL, I'M SORRY.

11:23.967 --> 11:25.567
WE'RE FRIENDS,
I CAN SAY THAT.

11:25.600 --> 11:26.867
NO BIG DEAL.

11:26.900 --> 11:28.700
I KNOW, I KNOW,
I'M SORRY, I'M SORRY.

11:28.733 --> 11:30.400
I'M JUST VERY OLD FASHIONED
ABOUT THAT KIND OF--

11:30.433 --> 11:31.933
OH, NO, LARRY, LARRY, HONEY,
THAT'S, THAT'S MY WATER.

11:31.967 --> 11:33.767
OH !

11:35.333 --> 11:37.667

EXCUSE ME.

11:44.433 --> 11:45.900

11:58.067 --> 11:59.167

12:01.167 --> 12:04.167
( laughing )
WHAT HAVE YOU,

12:04.200 --> 12:05.300

I CAN SEE THAT.

12:06.533 --> 12:07.500

12:07.533 --> 12:09.267
I NEEDED

12:09.300 --> 12:10.733
A NEW JACKET ?

12:10.767 --> 12:12.533
OH, YEAH.

12:12.567 --> 12:13.733
YOU LIKE IT ?

12:13.767 --> 12:14.733
IT'S INTERESTING,
DON'T YOU THINK ?

12:14.767 --> 12:17.067
IT'S LIKE HALF,
HALF JACKET, HALF SHIRT.

12:17.067 --> 12:20.467
I'VE NEVER SEEN YOU WITH
SHOPPING BAGS BEFORE.

12:20.500 --> 12:23.200
WHAT MADE YOU
DECIDE TO GO SHOPPING ?

12:23.233 --> 12:24.833
I DON'T KNOW.

12:24.867 --> 12:26.200
I WAS IN THE KITCHEN
THIS MORNING READING THE PAPER

12:26.233 --> 12:27.333
AND MARY CALLED.

12:27.367 --> 12:30.600
AND SHE SAID SHE WAS
GOING TO BARNEY'S AND...

12:30.633 --> 12:32.733
I THOUGHT,
OH, WHAT THE HELL,

12:32.767 --> 12:34.567
I NEEDED SOME STUFF,
SO, I MET HER OVER THERE.

12:34.600 --> 12:36.733
SO, YOU WENT
SHOPPING WITH MARY ?

12:36.767 --> 12:38.533
SHE CALLED UP TO TALK
ABOUT LAST NIGHT ACTUALLY.

12:38.567 --> 12:39.867
UH-HUH.

12:39.900 --> 12:41.133
AND WHAT A GREAT
TIME SHE HAD

12:41.167 --> 12:43.133

WE HAD A GREAT TIME.

12:43.167 --> 12:44.133
SHE SAYS HELLO.

12:44.167 --> 12:45.433
OH, OKAY.

12:45.467 --> 12:47.733
AND I DON'T KNOW, SHE JUST
MENTIONED SHE WAS GOING SHOPPING

12:47.767 --> 12:50.067
AND NEXT THING I KNEW,

12:50.067 --> 12:51.633
I SAID, ALRIGHT, YOU KNOW,
YEAH, I'LL GO.

12:51.667 --> 12:54.533
THAT'S BIZARRE,
DON'T YOU THINK ?

12:54.567 --> 12:56.500
WHY ?

12:56.533 --> 13:00.200
I'VE NEVER BEEN ABLE TO
GET YOU TO GO SHOPPING BEFORE.

13:00.233 --> 13:01.400
I'LL GO SHOPPING.

13:01.433 --> 13:02.900
NO, YOU WON'T.

13:02.933 --> 13:04.900
I'LL GO SHOPPING ANY TIME
YOU WANT TO GO SHOPPING,

13:04.933 --> 13:06.067
YOU LET ME KNOW.

13:06.067 --> 13:07.500
I'VE ASKED YOU TO GO
SHOPPING WITH ME BEFORE.

13:07.533 --> 13:08.600
WELL, MAYBE WHEN
YOU ASKED ME,

13:08.633 --> 13:10.300
I HAD SOMETHING TO DO,
I DON'T KNOW.

13:10.333 --> 13:11.833
YOU WANT TO GO,
LET'S GO ?!

13:11.867 --> 13:13.567
NOT NOW, YOU DON'T
NEED ANYTHING NOW !

13:13.600 --> 13:15.067
YES, I DO.

13:15.100 --> 13:17.300
I COULD USE SOME SOCKS
AND UNDERWEAR, SOME STUFF.

13:17.333 --> 13:18.833

13:18.867 --> 13:20.267

15:57.067 --> 15:59.067
KIDDING ? NO,
THEY'RE MY SHOES.

15:59.067 --> 16:00.867
THEY'RE YOUR SHOES ?

16:00.900 --> 16:01.867
YEAH.

16:01.900 --> 16:03.700
HOW CAN THEY
BE YOUR SHOES ?

16:03.733 --> 16:05.200
HOW CAN THEY BE ?

16:05.233 --> 16:07.367
BECAUSE THAT GUY GAVE THEM
TO YOU BY MISTAKE THE OTHER DAY.

16:07.400 --> 16:09.733
WELL, THAT'S WEIRD.

16:09.767 --> 16:11.133
THAT'S WEIRD ?

16:11.167 --> 16:12.167
YEAH.

16:12.200 --> 16:13.533
WHAT'S WEIRD ?

16:13.567 --> 16:14.767
THAT HE WOULD
GIVE ME THOSE SHOES ?

16:14.800 --> 16:16.167
NO, THAT'S NOT WEIRD.

16:16.200 --> 16:17.400
WHAT'S WEIRD IS THAT
YOU WOULD PUT THEM ON.

16:17.433 --> 16:18.467
THAT'S WHAT'S WEIRD.

16:18.500 --> 16:20.100
THAT'S, OH, MAN,

16:20.133 --> 16:21.900
IT'S NOT WEIRD THAT HE WOULD
GIVE ME THESE SHOES ?

16:21.933 --> 16:23.100
NO, THAT'S A MISTAKE.

16:23.133 --> 16:24.367
AND THEY'RE NOT MY SHOES
AND HE GAVE THEM TO ME.

16:24.400 --> 16:25.500
YEAH,
THAT'S A MISTAKE.

16:25.533 --> 16:26.833
THAT'S AN
HONEST MISTAKE.

16:26.867 --> 16:28.833
YEAH, WHAT'S WEIRD IS
THAT YOU WOULD TAKE SHOES

16:28.867 --> 16:30.233
THAT DON'T BELONG TO YOU
AND PUT THEM ON.

16:30.267 --> 16:31.500
THAT'S WEIRD.

16:31.533 --> 16:34.067
OR EVEN WEIRDER THAT YOU LEFT
WITHOUT EVEN YOUR SHOES.

16:34.100 --> 16:35.833
THAT'S NOT THAT WEIRD.

16:35.867 --> 16:37.067
I HAD NOTHING
ELSE TO WEAR.

16:37.100 --> 16:39.067
OH, THAT WOULD BE,
THAT'D BE KIND OF WEIRD.

16:39.067 --> 16:40.867
NO, THAT'S GONNA
BE WEIRD FOR YOU NOW

16:40.900 --> 16:42.067
AFTER I GET
THE SHOES BACK.

16:42.100 --> 16:43.100
THAT'LL BE WEIRD.

16:43.133 --> 16:44.100
OH, YOU WANT
THEM BACK ?

16:44.133 --> 16:45.100
YEAH, I DO.

16:45.133 --> 16:46.233
OH, OKAY.

16:46.267 --> 16:47.533
WOW.

16:47.567 --> 16:49.600
THEY'RE COMFORTABLE SHOES.

16:49.633 --> 16:50.867
YEAH, I KNOW THEY ARE.

16:50.900 --> 16:52.767
HE GAVE THEM TO ME, I DON'T
KNOW WHAT HE WAS THINKING.

16:52.800 --> 16:54.133
HE'S A NUT.

16:54.167 --> 16:55.800
HE'S A LITTLE NUTTY,
ISN'T HE ?

16:55.833 --> 16:57.067
YEAH, I KNOW.

16:57.067 --> 16:58.067
HE'S A LITTLE CRAZY.

16:58.100 --> 16:59.067
HE'S JUST
A LITTLE CRAZY.

16:59.100 --> 17:00.133
HE'S A LITTLE CRAZY.

17:00.167 --> 17:01.233
THOSE ARE
COMFORTABLE SHOES.

17:01.267 --> 17:02.333
I'M GLAD
YOU LIKED 'EM.

17:02.367 --> 17:03.333
OKAY.

17:03.367 --> 17:04.900
CRAZY, JEEZ.

17:13.500 --> 17:14.500
REMEMBER ME ?

17:14.533 --> 17:15.667
SURE DO.

17:15.700 --> 17:16.667
YEAH,
THE SHOES ?

17:16.700 --> 17:17.667
I KNOW THE ONES.

17:17.700 --> 17:18.667
HOW'D YOU DO ?

17:18.700 --> 17:19.733
PERFECT.

17:19.767 --> 17:23.167
I USED A DESALTER LIQUID
WITH A SCRUB BRUSH.

17:23.200 --> 17:26.300
AND THEN I USED
A DEODORIZER SPRAY.

17:26.333 --> 17:28.467
THEY SMELL
LIKE NEW SHOES.

17:28.500 --> 17:29.467
NO KIDDING.

17:29.500 --> 17:30.633
ALL FUMIGATED ?

17:30.667 --> 17:31.633
PERFECT.

17:31.667 --> 17:32.967
SO, I CAN WEAR THEM ?

17:33.067 --> 17:33.967
ALL SAFE ?

17:34.067 --> 17:35.100
YEAH, ENJOY THEM.

17:35.133 --> 17:36.300
THANKS.

17:36.333 --> 17:37.300
I'M GONNA
PUT THEM ON.

17:37.333 --> 17:38.267
PLEASE, DO.

17:42.100 --> 17:43.267
LISTEN TO THIS.

17:43.300 --> 17:47.300
SMOKEY GOT ME FLOOR SEATS
TO PAUL SIMON.

17:47.333 --> 17:48.900
YOU'RE KIDDING,
REALLY ?

17:48.933 --> 17:49.900
YUP.

17:49.933 --> 17:51.300
THAT'S GREAT.

17:51.333 --> 17:54.167
YOU KNOW WHAT ? I STILL HAVEN'T
HEARD FROM TED AND MARY.

17:54.200 --> 17:56.300
I MEAN, YOU KNOW,
WE DON'T KNOW WHERE TO GO,

17:56.333 --> 17:58.433
WHERE TO PICK UP THE TICKETS,
WE DON'T KNOW ANYTHING.

17:58.467 --> 18:00.733
IT'S THURSDAY ALREADY,
I'M GETTING A LITTLE CONCERNED.

18:00.767 --> 18:01.767
WANT ME TO
CALL THEM ?

18:01.800 --> 18:04.867
HI, I'M THE SALESMAN
FROM BARNEY'S, DANNY.

18:04.900 --> 18:06.567
YOU ORDERED
SOME SHOES.

18:06.600 --> 18:07.933
OH, THE SHOES,
YEAH, YEAH.

18:07.967 --> 18:08.933
HOW YOU DOING ?

18:08.967 --> 18:10.433
GOOD.

18:10.467 --> 18:12.833
THEY HAVEN'T COME IN YET,
BUT AS SOON AS THEY DO...

18:12.867 --> 18:14.233
UM...

18:16.900 --> 18:17.867
THOSE ARE CAMPERS.

18:17.900 --> 18:19.267
YEAH, WHAT HAPPENED WAS,
UH...

18:19.300 --> 18:21.533
YOU'RE STILL COMING IN
TO GET THE...

18:21.567 --> 18:23.200
WELL, LET ME
TELL YOU WHAT HAPPENED.

18:23.233 --> 18:26.367
SOMEBODY TOOK THE SHOES
ORIGINALLY THAT I HAD--

18:26.400 --> 18:27.733
I DON'T NEED TO HEAR
THE WHOLE STORY.

18:27.767 --> 18:31.067
YOU'RE COMING IN TO PURCHASE
THE SHOES THOUGH, RIGHT ?

18:31.067 --> 18:34.067
WELL, I DON'T REALLY
NEED THE SHOES NOW

18:34.100 --> 18:36.467
BECAUSE I GOT THEM BACK
AT THE BOWLING ALLEY, SO.

18:36.500 --> 18:39.867
YOU ASKED ME TO
WAIVE THE DEPOSIT

18:39.900 --> 18:41.500
AND I DID THAT FOR YOU.

18:41.533 --> 18:43.733
YOU LOOKED LIKE AN HONEST PERSON
AND I TRUSTED YOUR FACE.

18:43.767 --> 18:45.067
HE IS AN HONEST PERSON.

18:45.067 --> 18:47.600
YOU'RE VERY HONEST,
YOU'RE HONEST.

18:47.633 --> 18:49.533
OKAY, THIS DOESN'T
CONCERN YOU.

18:49.567 --> 18:51.333
I HAVEN'T DONE
ANYTHING DISHONEST.

18:51.367 --> 18:53.500
I CAN'T, I DON'T
NEED THE SHOES ANYMORE.

18:53.533 --> 18:54.767
THAT'S NOT DISHONEST.

18:54.800 --> 18:57.533
SIR, YOU ASKED A FAVOR OF ME
AND I HELPED YOU OUT,

18:57.567 --> 18:59.300
BUT AS LONG
YOU'RE TAKEN CARE OF,

18:59.333 --> 19:01.100
I GUESS THAT'S ALL
THAT REALLY MATTERS.

19:01.133 --> 19:04.667
NO, THAT'S NOT WHAT'S
ALL THAT REALLY MATTERS.

19:04.700 --> 19:06.133
THAT'S NOT WHAT MATTERS.

19:06.167 --> 19:08.133
I MEAN, DO YOU WANT ME
TO BUY TWO PAIRS ?

19:08.167 --> 19:10.833
NO, I WORK
ON COMMISSION, OKAY ?

19:10.867 --> 19:14.367
AND NOW, I'M PUT IN
A BAD SITUATION, ALRIGHT ?

19:14.400 --> 19:16.600
YOU KNOW,
I'M STUCK WITH THESE SHOES.

19:16.633 --> 19:19.067
AND SO I CAN'T EVEN--

19:19.067 --> 19:20.200
HOW MUCH IS
THE COMMISSION ?

19:20.233 --> 19:21.200
I'LL PAY YOU
THE COMMISSION, OKAY ?

19:21.233 --> 19:22.500
THAT IS
SO INSULTING.

19:22.533 --> 19:23.967
HOW DARE YOU ?

19:24.067 --> 19:25.333
THAT'S NOT
A "HOW DARE YOU".

19:25.367 --> 19:27.367
WHAT DO YOU MEAN, DARE ?
I'M NOT DARE--

19:27.400 --> 19:28.733
I AM NOT
A SHOE WHORE.

19:28.767 --> 19:30.267
I DIDN'T ACCUSE YOU
OF BEING A SHOE WHORE.

19:30.300 --> 19:32.200
I'M TRYING TO
RECTIFY THE SITUATION.

19:32.233 --> 19:35.100
YOU CANNOT BUY YOUR WAY
OUT OF THIS SITUATION.

19:35.133 --> 19:37.967
PEOPLE LIKE YOU
ARE THE PROBLEM.

19:38.067 --> 19:39.600
OH, YEAH, I'M NOT--
I'M THE SOLUTION.

19:39.633 --> 19:42.467
I'M THE SOLUTION
TO THE PROBLEM, OKAY ?

19:59.433 --> 20:01.533
THIS IS OUTRAGEOUS,
IT REALLY IS.

20:01.567 --> 20:04.600
I MEAN, WHAT KIND OF PEOPLE
INVITE YOU TO GO TO A CONCERT

20:04.633 --> 20:06.200
AND THEN THEY
DON'T CALL YOU ?

20:06.233 --> 20:07.867
IT'S 4:30.

20:07.900 --> 20:09.433
MAYBE WE SHOULD
CALL THEM.

20:09.467 --> 20:11.100
DO YOU KNOW HOW
AWKWARD THAT IS ?

20:11.133 --> 20:14.000
I MEAN, THEY KNOW
THEY INVITED US TO THE CONCERT.

20:14.033 --> 20:16.100
THEY'RE OBVIOUSLY
DELIBERATELY NOT CALLING.

20:16.133 --> 20:18.067
HOW COULD I CALL
THEM UP AND GO,

20:18.100 --> 20:19.367
"WE'RE WAITING
FOR YOUR CALL."

20:19.400 --> 20:20.500
AND THEN THEY'LL SAY,

20:20.533 --> 20:22.400
"WELL, WE DON'T
WANT TO GO WITH YOU."

20:23.700 --> 20:25.000
AT LEAST LIE TO US.

20:25.033 --> 20:26.000
RIGHT, SOMETHING.

20:26.033 --> 20:27.000
YOU KNOW,
CALL US AND LIE.

20:27.033 --> 20:28.400
DON'T LET US SIT HERE
LIKE SCHMUCKS.

20:28.433 --> 20:29.500
YEAH.

20:29.533 --> 20:32.000
A LIE IS A GESTURE,
IT'S A COURTESY.

20:32.033 --> 20:33.533
IT'S A LITTLE RESPECT.

20:33.567 --> 20:36.333
THIS IS
VERY DISRESPECTFUL.

20:38.100 --> 20:39.300
WELL, WHY WOULD
THEY DECIDE

20:39.333 --> 20:40.800
THAT THEY DON'T WANT
TO GO WITH US, THOUGH ?

20:40.833 --> 20:42.167
I DON'T KNOW.

20:42.200 --> 20:43.667
I MEAN, DID WE NOT
HAVE A GOOD TIME WITH THEM

20:43.700 --> 20:45.000
WHEN WE WENT BOWLING ?

20:45.033 --> 20:46.867
WE HAD A GREAT--
WAS THAT FUN ?

20:46.900 --> 20:48.233
THAT WAS A GOOD TIME.

20:48.267 --> 20:52.133
I MEAN, DID WE DO SOMETHING
TO OFFEND THEM ?

21:02.900 --> 21:04.200
WHAT ?

21:04.233 --> 21:07.833
AFTER BARNEY'S THE OTHER DAY,
WE WENT OUT TO LUNCH.

21:07.867 --> 21:09.067
RIGHT.

21:09.067 --> 21:13.433
AND, UH, I TOOK A SIP
FROM A GLASS OF WATER.

21:13.467 --> 21:19.333
AND HER MOTHER SAID TO ME,
"THAT'S MY GLASS."

21:19.367 --> 21:22.267
AND I WENT "BLEH !",
LIKE THAT.

21:28.467 --> 21:29.700
LARRY.

21:31.933 --> 21:33.933
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU'RE EVEN ACTING

21:33.967 --> 21:35.800
LIKE YOU DON'T KNOW
WHY WE'RE NOT INVITED.

21:35.833 --> 21:37.400
I DIDN'T THINK OF IT.

21:37.433 --> 21:38.767
UNBELIEVABLE.

21:38.800 --> 21:41.467
OF COURSE, THEY'RE NOT
GONNA CALL US.

21:41.500 --> 21:43.200
MARY'S MOTHER ?

21:44.467 --> 21:46.333
WHAT'S WRONG
WITH YOU ?

21:49.067 --> 21:51.700
I REALLY WANTED TO
GO TO THAT CONCERT.

21:51.733 --> 21:53.700
SO DID I,
I LIKE PAUL SIMON.

21:56.500 --> 22:02.600
* I MET MY OLD LOVER
ON THE STREET LAST NIGHT *

22:02.633 --> 22:05.700
* SHE SEEMS SO GLAD
TO SEE ME *

22:05.733 --> 22:07.800
* I JUST SMILE

22:09.300 --> 22:12.600
* AND WE TALKED
ABOUT SOME OLD TIMES *

22:12.633 --> 22:15.633
* AND WE DRANK
OURSELVES SOME BEERS *

22:15.667 --> 22:21.867
* STILL CRAZY
AFTER ALL THESE YEARS *

22:21.900 --> 22:26.967
* OH, STILL CRAZY
AFTER ALL THESE YEARS *

22:33.500 --> 22:38.900
* I'M NOT THE KIND OF MAN
WHO TENDS TO SOCIALIZE *

22:40.833 --> 22:44.900
* I SEEM TO LEAN ON
OLD FAMILIAR WAYS *

22:46.633 --> 22:53.700
* AND I AIN'T NO FOOL
FOR LOVE SONGS
THAT WHISPER IN MY EARS *

22:53.733 --> 22:58.933
* STILL CRAZY
AFTER ALL THESE YEARS *

22:58.967 --> 23:04.633
* OH, STILL CRAZY
AFTER ALL THESE YEARS *

23:04.667 --> 23:06.500
OH, HI,
HOW ARE YOU ?

23:06.533 --> 23:07.800
GOOD, I'D LIKE
TO RETURN THIS, PLEASE.

23:07.833 --> 23:09.567
WHAT SEEMS TO
BE THE PROBLEM ?

23:09.600 --> 23:12.300
UH, YOU KNOW, IT'S KIND OF
HALF JACKET, HALF SHIRT,

23:12.333 --> 23:14.167
HALF MAN, HALF BEAST.

23:14.200 --> 23:15.467
I DON'T KNOW,
IT'S...

23:15.500 --> 23:17.267
IT LOOKED SO GREAT ON YOU
THE OTHER DAY.

23:17.300 --> 23:18.533
EXCUSE ME.

23:18.567 --> 23:19.967
NO, SIR,
NO, I'M SORRY.

23:20.067 --> 23:21.733
WE WILL NOT BE
ACCEPTING THAT FROM YOU.

23:21.767 --> 23:22.967
WHY, WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT ?

23:23.067 --> 23:23.967
WHY NOT ?

23:24.067 --> 23:25.067
I KNOW YOUR LITTLE GAME.

23:25.100 --> 23:26.933
AND I'M NOT PLAYING IT.

23:26.967 --> 23:28.900
THERE'S NO GAME !
WHAT DO YOU MEAN, A GAME ?

23:28.933 --> 23:30.533
I HAVEN'T WORN THIS.

23:30.567 --> 23:32.300
LISTEN, I ONLY WORE THIS IN
THE STORE THE DAY I BOUGHT IT.

23:32.333 --> 23:33.567
SIR, I DID
A FAVOR FOR YOU.

23:33.600 --> 23:35.067
AND YOU
MESSED ME OVER ONCE

23:35.100 --> 23:36.333
AND I'M NOT GONNA
LET IT HAPPEN AGAIN.

23:36.367 --> 23:38.067
WHEN DID
I MESS YOU OVER ?

23:38.067 --> 23:39.267
I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE
TALKING ABOUT, MESS YOU OVER.

23:39.300 --> 23:40.733
OH, YOU'RE SO INNOCENT.

23:40.767 --> 23:42.833
I'M NOT DIABOLICAL,
YOU THINK I'M DIABOLICAL ?

23:42.867 --> 23:45.167
YAP, YAP, YAP, I DON'T
WANT TO HEAR ABOUT IT, OKAY ?

23:45.200 --> 23:46.433
HERE'S THE THING.

23:46.467 --> 23:50.400
I DID A FAVOR FOR YOU
AND YOU WALKED OVER ME.

23:50.433 --> 23:52.100
I DIDN'T EVEN
WEAR THIS THING.

23:52.133 --> 23:53.233
I SHOULD BE ALLOWED
TO RETURN THIS.

23:53.267 --> 23:54.233
IT IS RIDICULOUS.

23:54.267 --> 23:56.133
LARRY ? LARRY ?

23:56.167 --> 23:57.467
OH, HI !

23:57.500 --> 23:59.533
HI !

24:00.467 --> 24:01.433
HOW ARE YOU ?

24:01.467 --> 24:02.567
GOOD, HOW YOU DOING ?

24:02.600 --> 24:03.733
JUST FINE.

24:03.767 --> 24:04.967
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE ?

24:05.067 --> 24:06.900
UH, I HAD A LITTLE ZIPPER
PROBLEM ON THE... IT'S OKAY.

24:06.933 --> 24:10.067
HEY, WERE YOU AT
THAT CONCERT LAST NIGHT ?

24:10.100 --> 24:11.633
OH, YES.

24:11.667 --> 24:13.067
I MEAN, THE BOX
WAS ENTIRELY FULL.

24:13.100 --> 24:14.233
IS THAT SO ?

24:14.267 --> 24:15.500
YES.

24:15.533 --> 24:18.433
DID TED OR MARY
SAY ANYTHING ABOUT ME, OR ?

24:18.467 --> 24:20.433
OH, HONEY, I DON'T THINK ANYBODY
MENTIONED YOUR NAME AT ALL.

24:20.467 --> 24:21.867
OH, IS THAT RIGHT ?

24:21.900 --> 24:22.867
YEAH.

24:22.900 --> 24:24.400
IT WASN'T EVEN
MENTIONED AT ALL ?

24:24.433 --> 24:26.167
WELL, I DIDN'T HEAR
ANYBODY SAY ANYTHING.

24:26.200 --> 24:29.367
WHERE'S MARY ?

24:29.400 --> 24:31.767
OH, SHE'S RIGHT
OVER THERE.
