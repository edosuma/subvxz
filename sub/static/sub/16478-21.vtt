Shots fired!

Hey, you shot?

01:14.336 --> 01:15.602
I don't know.

01:15.604 --> 01:17.137
I don't think so.

01:54.176 --> 01:56.843
I mean, c-can't they
hack into that

01:56.845 --> 01:59.145
and record me
without my knowing?

01:59.147 --> 02:00.847
We've already
disabled it, Mr. Mayor.

02:00.849 --> 02:02.515
Same with your
laptop and cell.

02:02.517 --> 02:04.417
Yeah. You sure about that?
'Cause, uh,

02:04.419 --> 02:06.620
I don't need no more leaks.
I got enough problems.

02:06.622 --> 02:08.854
Certain people
try to bring me down

02:08.857 --> 02:11.157
any way they can, you know?

02:11.159 --> 02:13.827
We'll scan your car
and home next.

02:13.829 --> 02:16.196
But, for now,
this room's secure.

02:16.198 --> 02:18.365
Good. Phones, too?

02:18.367 --> 02:19.733
Uh, don't use landlines.

02:19.735 --> 02:21.468
But make sure your
assistant lets you know

02:21.470 --> 02:22.969
if she hears any
echoes or clicks.

02:22.971 --> 02:24.471
Could mean a wiretap.

02:24.473 --> 02:26.506
And, if so, we should be
able to trace its source.

02:26.508 --> 02:27.874
What about cell phones--
they good?

02:27.876 --> 02:29.242
Cell's good.

02:29.244 --> 02:32.412
All right.
We're good, then.

02:32.414 --> 02:33.880
2,000, right?

02:33.882 --> 02:35.615
Uh, that's okay,
we'll just bill you.

02:35.617 --> 02:37.050
Uh, no. No, no.

02:37.052 --> 02:38.451
No bills.

02:38.453 --> 02:40.553
It's between us, you understand?

02:40.555 --> 02:41.755
Understood.

02:41.757 --> 02:43.690
Okay.

02:49.264 --> 02:51.331
Hello?
Frank, it's Hamilton.

02:51.333 --> 02:53.066
Are you sure
this line is secure?

02:53.068 --> 02:54.768
Honestly, I'm not sure
about anything anymore.

02:54.770 --> 02:56.469
Gotten in pretty deep here.

02:56.471 --> 02:58.905
Nor should you be, Mr. Mayor,
'cause I'm gonna be

02:58.907 --> 03:00.840
up and in your grill, baby.

03:00.842 --> 03:03.977
How can we still hear him
if they swept his cell?

03:03.979 --> 03:07.447
You can't sweep
a Triple P shadow app,

03:07.449 --> 03:09.983
which allows me
to listen to and record

03:09.985 --> 03:12.953
any and everything
within earshot.

03:12.955 --> 03:15.055
Problem is, anything
and everything isn't covered

03:15.057 --> 03:16.690
under the wiretap warrant.

03:16.692 --> 03:18.491
Only what's related
to Clearwater

03:18.493 --> 03:20.727
or his alleged
offshore slush funds.

03:20.729 --> 03:22.062
And Javier Garcia's murder.

03:22.064 --> 03:23.530
Let Jess know,

03:23.532 --> 03:26.066
uh, I won't be seeing her
for a while.

03:26.068 --> 03:28.868
Can't risk the media finding out
about any more of these affairs.

03:28.870 --> 03:31.705
Stop recording.
Wait, what?

03:31.707 --> 03:33.239
Personal information
is not covered

03:33.241 --> 03:35.075
under the scope
of the wiretap.

03:35.077 --> 03:37.744
Look, Dwayne, if this isn't done
within the strict parameters

03:37.746 --> 03:39.813
of the order,
it won't stand up in court.

03:39.815 --> 03:42.048
Mayor's dirty, Karen.

03:42.050 --> 03:44.484
Look, Rita's put together
a solid circumstantial case,

03:44.486 --> 03:47.153
but Jenkins-- he was
the only judge willing to risk

03:47.155 --> 03:50.156
going up against Hamilton
to grant the tap.

03:50.158 --> 03:52.158
I know how bad
you want to take him down,

03:52.160 --> 03:53.994
but if you don't
do this by the book,

03:53.996 --> 03:55.362
you're gonna
blow the wiretap.

03:55.364 --> 03:57.630
And Hamilton
gets away with murder.

03:57.632 --> 03:59.666
And everything else.

04:01.470 --> 04:03.136
Stop recording.

04:06.108 --> 04:08.174
Ah, all right,
I got a case.

04:08.176 --> 04:09.843
Keep monitoring the mayor.

04:09.845 --> 04:12.479
Are you sure Patton knows
what keywords to listen for?

04:12.481 --> 04:13.980
Is he read in
on Clearwater,

04:13.982 --> 04:15.482
every detail?

04:15.484 --> 04:17.350
No, not everything.

04:17.351 --> 04:19.786
Then I'd stay put
if I were you.

04:19.788 --> 04:22.155
May only get this one shot
at Hamilton.

04:32.134 --> 04:35.035
Yeah, is Pride all right?
How'd he sound?

04:35.037 --> 04:36.569
Torn.

04:36.571 --> 04:38.004
Had to talk him
into staying put,

04:38.006 --> 04:39.339
focusing on trying
to get Hamilton

04:39.341 --> 04:40.640
before Hamilton gets us.

04:40.642 --> 04:42.442
Yeah, King's loyal to the job.

04:42.444 --> 04:45.345
It's not easy for him not
taking the lead on a case.

04:45.347 --> 04:47.147
All the more reason for us
to kick ass on this one.

04:47.149 --> 04:48.615
Do you want me to go
pick up Percy?

04:48.617 --> 04:51.117
No, I'm already here
at the coffee shop.

04:51.119 --> 04:53.086
We'll meet you at the crime...

04:54.122 --> 04:56.089
...scene.

04:57.826 --> 04:59.859
Lasalle?

05:01.129 --> 05:02.796
Lasalle, you still there?

05:02.798 --> 05:05.065
Yeah, I'm still here.

05:05.067 --> 05:06.633
We'll see you in a bit.

05:06.635 --> 05:08.535
Hey!

05:08.537 --> 05:10.036
Country Mouse.

05:10.038 --> 05:11.504
If I knew you were my ride,

05:11.506 --> 05:13.440
I would've picked
you up a croissant.

05:16.645 --> 05:17.677
Everything all right?

05:17.679 --> 05:20.747
Yeah, sure. Let's roll.

05:33.061 --> 05:34.961
Hey, you sure
nothing's bothering you?

05:34.963 --> 05:36.796
Me? No, why?

05:36.798 --> 05:38.498
I don't know, maybe 'cause
you only said, like,

05:38.500 --> 05:40.533
two words to me
on the way over.

05:40.535 --> 05:42.268
Come on, it's me. What?

05:42.270 --> 05:43.603
Gregorio, what do we got?

05:43.605 --> 05:44.938
Hello to you, too,
Christopher.

05:44.940 --> 05:46.573
Oh, girl, he is in a mood.

05:46.575 --> 05:48.541
I can see that.

05:48.543 --> 05:50.043
Heist crew were pros,

05:50.045 --> 05:51.845
took out cameras,
jammed communication,

05:51.847 --> 05:54.114
knew exactly what they were
after and where to get it.

05:54.116 --> 05:55.849
Sebastian, what's the haul?

05:55.851 --> 05:57.884
Couple hundred MP5s
headed to Fort Bragg.

05:57.886 --> 05:59.519
The Navy's still
doing an inventory

05:59.521 --> 06:01.187
to get an exact
count, but...

06:01.189 --> 06:03.656
That's a lot
of serious firepower.

06:03.658 --> 06:05.892
I mean, this can't just
be about selling them

06:05.894 --> 06:07.360
on the black market.

06:07.362 --> 06:09.062
We're dealing with
some kind of militia?

06:09.064 --> 06:11.064
Well, whoever it was,
they came prepared.

06:11.066 --> 06:13.867
According to the railway cops,
they all had body armor,

06:13.869 --> 06:15.969
were using AR-15s,
concussive grenades.

06:15.971 --> 06:17.337
How many were injured?

06:17.339 --> 06:18.571
That's the thing-- none.

06:18.573 --> 06:22.475
Whoa. Heist crew
using AR-15s, grenades,

06:22.477 --> 06:26.045
making off with MP5s,
and no cop gets shot?

06:26.047 --> 06:28.381
Oh, no, cops were shot all
right, just not with bullets.

06:28.383 --> 06:29.749
Yeah, not with lethal rounds.

06:29.751 --> 06:31.117
With rubber bullets.

06:31.119 --> 06:32.352
Specifically
designed composite,

06:32.354 --> 06:33.686
packs a heck of a punch,

06:33.688 --> 06:35.221
especially coming
out of an AR-15.

06:35.223 --> 06:37.190
It's more than enough to
knock the wind out of you.

06:37.192 --> 06:39.259
- But not kill.
- Which begs the question,

06:39.261 --> 06:41.461
what kind of heist crew steals
hundreds of lethal weapons

06:41.463 --> 06:43.129
using nonlethal rounds?

06:43.131 --> 06:44.531
Yeah. Doesn't make sense.

06:44.533 --> 06:45.899
Yeah, well, fortunately
the rail cops

06:45.901 --> 06:47.534
were using live ammo.

06:49.237 --> 06:50.570
They tagged one of the crew.

06:50.572 --> 06:53.173
Lost a lot of blood. I should
be able to get a DNA I.D.

06:53.175 --> 06:54.908
All right, let us know
what you find, Sebastian.

06:54.910 --> 06:56.976
Who's the fat cat?

06:57.946 --> 06:59.946
Owner of the company
that makes the guns,

06:59.948 --> 07:01.181
Justus Bancroft.

07:01.183 --> 07:02.715
Or the victim.

07:02.717 --> 07:05.418
Whoa. Spent a lot
of years at ATF

07:05.420 --> 07:07.987
seeing the pain
Bancroft guns cause.

07:07.989 --> 07:10.190
Hardly makes them a victim.

07:12.360 --> 07:13.626
Excuse me.

07:13.628 --> 07:16.863
NCIS. Mind if I get a word?

07:16.865 --> 07:19.032
Sorry, is there a problem?

07:19.034 --> 07:21.134
No, no, no, not at all.

07:21.136 --> 07:22.635
It's just that, uh, well,

07:22.637 --> 07:24.604
we already told the police
everything we know.

07:24.606 --> 07:26.139
And we have to go.

07:26.141 --> 07:28.374
I'm sorry, who are you?

07:28.376 --> 07:29.809
Nadine.

07:29.811 --> 07:31.244
Bancroft.

07:32.547 --> 07:35.148
Special Agent Lasalle.

07:35.150 --> 07:37.483
We'll talk with NOPD afterwards,
but if you don't mind...

07:37.485 --> 07:41.120
No, no, of course, of course.
Ask me anything.

07:41.122 --> 07:43.156
Well, it's just that,
uh, we're hosting

07:43.158 --> 07:44.958
our annual charity
event tomorrow.

07:44.960 --> 07:48.761
I kind of think a couple hundred
missing submachine guns

07:48.763 --> 07:50.964
trumps your little party,
don't you?

07:50.966 --> 07:52.065
Percy.

07:53.001 --> 07:54.901
No disrespect, but, uh,

07:54.903 --> 07:57.470
we got to do our jobs,
and that's a lot of guns.

07:57.472 --> 07:59.072
Oh, yeah, trust me, I know.

07:59.074 --> 08:01.040
It's not the first time
we've been hit, either.

08:01.042 --> 08:02.275
You've been robbed before?

08:02.277 --> 08:04.911
Well, not to this extent,
but yes.

08:04.913 --> 08:06.980
Uh, the FBI, ATF,
they both investigated

08:06.982 --> 08:09.349
the other two times,
and, uh, come up empty.

08:09.351 --> 08:11.784
I'm just glad none
of the police got hurt.

08:11.786 --> 08:14.520
Well, third time, there's
got to be a connection.

08:14.522 --> 08:16.823
We'll dig into it and
let you know what we find.

08:16.825 --> 08:18.424
All right.
We'll be in touch.

08:18.426 --> 08:20.493
You, uh, call me anytime.

08:20.495 --> 08:22.128
Thank you.
All right.

08:22.130 --> 08:23.263
Thanks.

08:25.166 --> 08:27.500
I don't think King

08:27.502 --> 08:29.736
would've much liked
the way you talked to her.

08:29.738 --> 08:32.238
Don't much like the way
you talked to me.

08:32.240 --> 08:33.840
She acted like this
was nothing more

08:33.842 --> 08:36.208
than an inconvenience.

08:36.211 --> 08:37.943
That didn't bother you?

08:37.946 --> 08:39.979
Oh, I forgot,

08:39.981 --> 08:42.682
nothing's
bothering you.

08:42.683 --> 08:44.116
Right.

08:49.691 --> 08:51.057
Making yourself at home
at my desk?

08:51.059 --> 08:52.659
Oh, Pride, no, no, no.
I'm sorry.

08:52.661 --> 08:53.960
I just, I didn't want to

08:53.962 --> 08:55.628
bother you and Patton.
It's okay, Sebastian.

08:55.630 --> 08:57.196
Just teasing. Sit down.

08:57.198 --> 09:00.566
Be more than happy to trade
places with you, believe me.

09:00.568 --> 09:02.502
Sitting on a wiretap's
kind of boring, huh?

09:02.504 --> 09:03.770
More like tedious.

09:03.772 --> 09:05.438
Plus, I'm learning
more about Hamilton

09:05.440 --> 09:07.907
than I ever wanted to know.
A lot more.

09:07.909 --> 09:10.943
But nothing that connects him
to the murders or Clearwater?

09:10.945 --> 09:12.612
Not yet.

09:12.614 --> 09:13.613
But it's just

09:13.615 --> 09:14.881
a matter of time.

09:14.883 --> 09:16.482
Where are you on the case?

09:16.484 --> 09:19.152
Well, using the DNA I
found at the crime scene,

09:19.154 --> 09:21.087
I'm trying to I.D.
our wounded bad guy,

09:21.089 --> 09:22.255
but nothing's coming up so far,

09:22.257 --> 09:23.790
which is, you know,
a little odd.

09:23.792 --> 09:25.558
Okay. But not unusual.

09:25.560 --> 09:26.993
I just got off
the phone with FBI,

09:26.995 --> 09:28.928
checked on the prior heists,
and they got nothing, either.

09:28.930 --> 09:30.730
Well, that's
hard to believe.

09:30.732 --> 09:32.632
Three high-profile
hits, no evidence.

09:32.634 --> 09:33.933
How's that possible?

09:33.935 --> 09:35.401
Even stranger, none of
the past stolen guns

09:35.403 --> 09:37.003
have showed up on
the street or black market.

09:37.005 --> 09:38.237
It's as if they
just disappeared.

09:38.239 --> 09:41.240
Yeah, maybe I should
get involved.

09:41.242 --> 09:42.508
No, Hamilton knows
you're after him.

09:42.510 --> 09:43.910
You can't let up now.
It's too important.

09:43.912 --> 09:45.878
So is a couple hundred
missing guns.

09:45.880 --> 09:47.880
Oh, no wonder I
didn't get a match.

09:47.882 --> 09:51.184
I programmed the I.D. search
for bad guys, not bad girls.

09:51.186 --> 09:52.118
That's male bias,
by the way.

09:52.120 --> 09:53.486
I apologize for that.

09:53.488 --> 09:55.955
Uh, Josephine Bellacroix.

09:55.957 --> 09:57.290
First Lieutenant,
born in New Orleans.

09:57.292 --> 09:58.358
A Marine?

09:58.360 --> 09:59.726
Yeah, flawless record, too.

09:59.728 --> 10:02.762
She did a tour
in Somalia and Sudan.

10:02.764 --> 10:04.297
Left the Corps a year ago.

10:04.299 --> 10:06.466
Just before the first heist.

10:06.468 --> 10:08.501
Wonder what made her
start stealing guns.

10:08.503 --> 10:10.403
Pick her up, find out.

10:10.405 --> 10:11.738
And before you do that...
All right, I'll call Lasalle.

10:11.740 --> 10:13.172
He and Sonja are
still in the field.

10:13.174 --> 10:15.341
Sebastian, start looking
for known associates,

10:15.343 --> 10:16.511
see if we can find out
who she's working with.

10:16.535 --> 10:17.611
I'm on it.

10:17.612 --> 10:19.045
Hey.

10:19.848 --> 10:21.814
We got this.
Don't worry about us.

10:33.161 --> 10:35.161
If you're gonna keep giving me
the silent treatment

10:35.163 --> 10:36.629
and being mean to me...

10:36.631 --> 10:38.097
I'm not being
mean to you.

10:38.099 --> 10:40.566
Okay, so what's your problem?

10:40.568 --> 10:42.802
I don't understand.

10:42.804 --> 10:45.004
I was just surprised
this morning,

10:45.006 --> 10:47.673
seeing you with that guy
at the coffee shop.

10:47.675 --> 10:50.343
Wait, Tom?

10:50.345 --> 10:52.245
I didn't know you
were dating anybody.

10:52.247 --> 10:54.647
I'm not dating anybody.

10:54.649 --> 10:56.082
It was just coffee.

10:56.084 --> 10:57.784
Besides, I barely know that guy.

10:57.786 --> 10:59.819
Well, you knew him
well enough to kiss him.

10:59.821 --> 11:02.422
I didn't kiss--
he kissed me.

11:05.593 --> 11:06.993
Are you jealous?

11:06.995 --> 11:08.694
Jealous.

11:08.696 --> 11:10.663
You're jealous.
You're trippin', girl.

11:10.665 --> 11:13.099
Come on. Let's gear up.

11:25.847 --> 11:28.114
Shotguns? Really?

11:28.116 --> 11:29.715
Yeah, wounded Marine.

11:29.717 --> 11:32.418
She's probably armed
with a MP5 by now.

11:32.420 --> 11:34.187
Better safe than sorry.

11:37.225 --> 11:39.225
Federal agents!

11:44.199 --> 11:45.898
Percy.

11:52.907 --> 11:55.808
No way that's just
from the heist shooting.

12:05.193 --> 12:07.393
House across the street
has a security camera,

12:07.395 --> 12:09.161
but it's a bad angle
to I.D. anyone

12:09.163 --> 12:11.197
going in and out
of Bellacroix's place.

12:11.199 --> 12:14.233
Ooh, so no one walking out
with an MP5?

12:14.235 --> 12:16.435
Lady carrying a small bag.
That's about it.

12:16.437 --> 12:17.703
It's looking
more and more like

12:17.705 --> 12:19.605
the crew took her out
to cover their tracks.

12:19.607 --> 12:22.542
Takes a pretty vicious crew
to take out one of their own.

12:22.544 --> 12:23.809
We need to find out
who they are

12:23.811 --> 12:25.811
so we can get
those guns back, fast.

12:25.813 --> 12:28.114
The problem is, they're so good
at covering their tracks,

12:28.116 --> 12:29.582
we got squat.

12:29.584 --> 12:33.052
Yeah. If we could just figure
out what made a decorated Marine

12:33.054 --> 12:35.121
join a heist crew
in the first place.

12:35.123 --> 12:37.123
Are you sure
there weren't any red flags

12:37.125 --> 12:38.324
in her service record?

12:38.326 --> 12:40.359
No PTSD, no psych alarm.

12:40.361 --> 12:43.262
Any of her known associates
with criminal backgrounds?

12:43.264 --> 12:46.699
No. Bellacroix's a NOLA native,
LSU grad, top of her class.

12:46.701 --> 12:48.434
Like I said, squat.

12:48.436 --> 12:52.305
Look, I know the Hamilton wire
is important and everything,

12:52.307 --> 12:54.574
but think maybe it's time
to loop Pride in?

12:54.576 --> 12:58.077
King's expecting us
to find leads.

13:00.081 --> 13:01.347
Let's keep digging.

13:01.349 --> 13:03.716
All right.

13:07.155 --> 13:08.654
Hey, guys.

13:08.656 --> 13:10.590
Oh, man, it's so weird
being back here

13:10.592 --> 13:11.991
and seeing you guys there.

13:11.993 --> 13:15.528
It's like, “Just when I thought
I was out, they pulled...”

13:15.530 --> 13:18.264
It's Michael Corleone,
from, uh, from <i>The Godfather 3.</i>

13:20.902 --> 13:23.302
Guys, I think my...
my screen froze.

13:23.304 --> 13:24.904
Ballistics on
the victim, please.

13:24.906 --> 13:26.238
Right, sure.

13:26.240 --> 13:28.274
Well, the bullet pattern
on our dead Marine

13:28.276 --> 13:31.010
suggests that all 13 bullets
came from an MP5.

13:31.012 --> 13:32.778
Which, if you ask me,
that's overkill.

13:32.780 --> 13:35.548
Even more reason to suspect
her crew took her out.

13:35.550 --> 13:36.716
Still, something doesn't add up.

13:36.718 --> 13:38.618
They went out of their way
to use rubber bullets

13:38.620 --> 13:40.186
for the heist,
but then use real bullets

13:40.188 --> 13:41.420
to kill one of their own?

13:41.422 --> 13:44.023
Maybe they knew killing cops
guarantees the needle.

13:44.025 --> 13:47.059
Yeah, but if any of those guns
end up as the murder weapon,

13:47.061 --> 13:48.327
they'll get the needle anyway.

13:48.329 --> 13:49.895
We're missing something.

13:49.897 --> 13:51.931
Hey, did you get anything
on those rubber bullets yet?

13:53.034 --> 13:54.367
You wanted me to call

13:54.369 --> 13:56.769
as soon as the autopsy
was completed.

13:56.771 --> 13:58.170
Whoa. Hey, Doc.

13:58.172 --> 14:00.106
This is so crazy,
it's like old times.

14:00.108 --> 14:01.874
You, me, plasmas.

14:01.876 --> 14:03.476
I didn't know you were
in your lab, Sebastian.

14:03.478 --> 14:05.011
Why didn't you say something?

14:05.013 --> 14:06.912
Well, I know
better than to bother you

14:06.914 --> 14:08.781
when you're elbow deep in liver.

14:08.783 --> 14:10.116
I hate to interrupt.

14:10.118 --> 14:11.951
Autopsy results, right.

14:11.953 --> 14:13.319
Okay, no surprises.

14:13.321 --> 14:16.255
C.O.D.: multiple gunshot wounds.

14:16.257 --> 14:19.759
The bullets hit every
major artery and organ,

14:19.761 --> 14:21.560
and any one of them
would've sufficed.

14:21.562 --> 14:25.297
This was obviously
a statement killing.

14:25.299 --> 14:27.767
One way to keep the rest
of the crew in line.

14:27.769 --> 14:29.535
However, there
is an anomaly.

14:29.537 --> 14:32.071
Before Ms. Bellacroix
was murdered,

14:32.073 --> 14:34.840
someone sutured
the initial gunshot wound

14:34.842 --> 14:36.676
inflicted by the railway officer

14:36.678 --> 14:38.144
during the heist.

14:38.146 --> 14:39.679
Even removed the bullet.

14:39.681 --> 14:42.915
Wait, why would they try
to save her only to kill her?

14:42.917 --> 14:44.417
That doesn't make any sense.

14:44.419 --> 14:46.952
Especially when you factor in
that they gave her

14:46.954 --> 14:50.990
broad-spectrum prophylaxis
to fight infection.

14:50.992 --> 14:52.858
Bullet removal, sutures,

14:52.860 --> 14:54.193
antibiotics--
I mean, this has to

14:54.195 --> 14:55.861
have been done
by a doctor, right?

14:55.863 --> 14:57.296
Maybe.

14:57.298 --> 14:58.798
But she didn't go to a hospital.

14:58.800 --> 15:01.634
The lady with the bag.

15:01.636 --> 15:03.169
Sebastian,
did you tell them about

15:03.171 --> 15:04.303
the rubber bullets yet?

15:04.305 --> 15:06.072
No, not yet.

15:06.074 --> 15:07.173
So, um, police everywhere
have been

15:07.175 --> 15:08.240
looking to use more and more

15:08.242 --> 15:09.408
nonlethal ammo.

15:09.410 --> 15:11.143
It's been a real boon
for gun manufacturers.

15:11.145 --> 15:14.246
Fortunately, each company
that makes rubber bullets

15:14.248 --> 15:16.482
uses its own
proprietary design, so,

15:16.484 --> 15:19.485
the bullets used by
the heist crew

15:19.487 --> 15:21.487
are actually Bancroft bullets.

15:21.489 --> 15:24.790
Bancroft bullets used
to steal Bancroft guns?

15:24.792 --> 15:26.959
I might've found another
Bancroft connection.

15:26.961 --> 15:29.295
Sorry, Doc, I need
the screen for another doc.

15:29.297 --> 15:32.598
Emma Miller, a Doctors
Without Borders physician,

15:32.600 --> 15:34.033
also Bellacroix's doctor
of record.

15:34.035 --> 15:35.768
They grew up in
New Orleans together

15:35.770 --> 15:38.237
and graduated LSU
at the same time.

15:38.239 --> 15:40.606
Which makes sense Bellacroix
would call a doctor friend

15:40.608 --> 15:42.302
to stitch her up
without ratting her out.

15:42.326 --> 15:42.943
Mm-hmm.

15:42.944 --> 15:46.345
Yeah, we need to find Dr. Miller
and see what she has to say.

15:46.347 --> 15:47.646
What's the Bancroft connection?

15:47.648 --> 15:49.515
A big one.
Dr. Miller sits on the board

15:49.517 --> 15:52.551
of the Bancroft Family
Foundation of New Orleans.

15:52.553 --> 15:55.421
Which means that she could be at
that charity shindig right now.

15:55.423 --> 15:57.356
Bancroft bullets,
guns and friends.

15:57.358 --> 16:00.126
You guys think
this is an inside job?

16:00.128 --> 16:03.696
Only way to find out is for us
to crash their little party.

16:03.698 --> 16:04.964
Hold on.

16:04.966 --> 16:06.866
Bancrofts are
a founding family here,

16:06.868 --> 16:08.467
go back for generations.

16:08.469 --> 16:10.736

who stole them real soon,

She helped set up.

17:46.567 --> 17:48.334
What's she got to do with this?

17:48.336 --> 17:49.969
Yeah, we're not sure. That's why
we want to talk to her.

Yeah, she's here somewhere,

18:02.950 --> 18:04.350
Afraid not.

18:04.352 --> 18:05.818
How well do you know Dr. Miller?

18:05.820 --> 18:07.519
She's like

18:27.808 --> 18:29.341
Emma Miller.

18:30.411 --> 18:33.112
Executed, just like Bellacroix.

18:35.082 --> 18:37.016
Looks like it happened
a couple hours ago.

18:37.018 --> 18:39.285
Maybe even before
the party started.

18:42.356 --> 18:44.757
Well, we just got back
from Dr. Miller's house.

18:44.759 --> 18:48.227
Found body armor, a balaclava
and night vision goggles.

18:48.229 --> 18:50.829
So, unless she liked
performing surgery in the dark

18:50.831 --> 18:53.465
and under enemy fire, I'd say
she was part of the heist crew.

18:53.467 --> 18:55.834
Two women on the crew?
That's unusual.

18:55.836 --> 18:57.703
Yeah, but if it's true,
it doesn't make sense

18:57.705 --> 18:59.872
that the crew's trying
to cover their tracks now.

18:59.874 --> 19:01.974
It's got to be
somebody else targeting them.

19:01.976 --> 19:03.342
Like what, a rival crew?

19:03.344 --> 19:06.445
Trying to get the guns
for themselves, possibly.

19:06.447 --> 19:09.615
Could be a black market buyer
double-crossing them.

19:09.617 --> 19:11.984
You find any rubber bullets
at Miller's house?

19:11.986 --> 19:15.087
Yeah, several boxes, actually.
All of them made by Bancroft.

19:15.089 --> 19:17.122
Bancroft's name just keeps
popping up, doesn't it?

19:17.124 --> 19:19.224
Popping up in
more places than you think.

19:19.226 --> 19:21.460
You need to hear this,
but hurry.

19:23.464 --> 19:25.531
off my back, you understand?

19:25.533 --> 19:28.567
I can't have them investigating
those missing guns,

19:28.569 --> 19:30.402
not now.
What does that mean?

19:30.404 --> 19:31.670
You know where they are?

19:31.672 --> 19:33.105
Mayor Hamilton?

19:33.107 --> 19:34.907
Hamilton was on
the phone just starting

19:34.909 --> 19:37.876
to talk about Clearwater
when Bancroft bulled his way in.

19:37.878 --> 19:39.211
- Shh.
- But I got enough

19:39.213 --> 19:40.546
of my own problems with NCIS.

19:40.548 --> 19:41.814
There's nothing I can do.

19:41.816 --> 19:43.782
You can use
your connections.

19:43.784 --> 19:45.818
Go over their heads.

19:45.820 --> 19:49.054
Say you'll get the guns back
on your own. Be a hero.

19:49.056 --> 19:51.824
Yeah, and how am I supposed to
get those guns back exactly?

19:51.826 --> 19:53.792
You leave that to me.

19:55.930 --> 19:58.163
Wasn't anything to do
with Clearwater,

19:58.165 --> 20:00.699
but I thought I should
record it anyway.

20:00.701 --> 20:03.102
Can't believe Bancroft
stole his own guns.

20:03.104 --> 20:04.803
Yeah, question is: why?

20:04.805 --> 20:06.605
Company's doing
great financially,

20:06.607 --> 20:08.407
doesn't need
the insurance payoff.

20:08.409 --> 20:10.809
Doesn't matter, we can't use
what we just heard anyway.

20:10.811 --> 20:12.244
Scope of the wiretap

20:12.246 --> 20:14.313
is only for Hamilton
and Clearwater.

20:14.315 --> 20:16.115
Well, we can't
just ignore it.

20:16.117 --> 20:18.250
Man all but
incriminated himself.

20:18.252 --> 20:20.586
Why don't you just
bring Bancroft in, scare him?

20:20.588 --> 20:21.820
And let the lawyers argue

20:21.822 --> 20:23.555
whether it was
admissible or not later.

20:23.557 --> 20:25.758
Because then Bancroft would
find out about the tap,

20:25.760 --> 20:27.559
which means so
would Hamilton.

20:27.561 --> 20:30.262
And then it would blow your
one chance to bring him down.

20:30.264 --> 20:33.165
Yeah, on the other hand,
two people are already dead

20:33.167 --> 20:34.800
'cause of those guns.

20:34.802 --> 20:37.536
How many more are gonna die
before we get them back?

20:37.538 --> 20:39.405
So what are you gonna do?

20:50.418 --> 20:52.584
You're making a mistake.

21:01.695 --> 21:04.830
It's a big risk, Pride.
Just saying.

21:04.832 --> 21:07.833
Hope we don't lose
Hamilton over it.

21:07.835 --> 21:09.368
Me, too.

21:22.925 --> 21:24.958
Got to say,
I'm a little surprised.

21:24.960 --> 21:26.726
Man of your means--

21:26.728 --> 21:29.496
would've thought you'd have
asked for a lawyer by now.

21:29.498 --> 21:32.432
I'm innocent.
I don't need a lawyer.

21:32.434 --> 21:34.434
Well, innocent men don't tend
to incriminate themselves,

21:34.436 --> 21:36.269
Mr. Bancroft.

21:36.271 --> 21:39.339
How else do you think I would've
gotten an arrest warrant?

21:39.341 --> 21:41.541
I don't know, you tell me.

21:43.345 --> 21:44.611
Patton?

21:44.613 --> 21:45.846
Yeah.

21:45.848 --> 21:47.080
I'm sorry, Bancroft,

21:47.082 --> 21:48.915
but I got enough of
my own problems with NCIS.

21:48.917 --> 21:50.083
There's nothing I can do.

21:50.085 --> 21:51.985
You can use your connections,

21:51.987 --> 21:53.487
go over their heads.

21:53.489 --> 21:57.357
Say you'll get the guns back
on your own. Be a hero.

21:57.359 --> 22:00.293
Yeah, and how am I supposed
to get those guns back exactly?

22:00.295 --> 22:02.796
You leave that to me.

22:03.966 --> 22:06.266
Doesn't sound
so innocent to me.

22:06.268 --> 22:09.002
That is taken out of context.

22:09.004 --> 22:11.438
Besides, how'd you get that?

22:11.440 --> 22:14.474
You put a tap on me?
On what grounds?

22:14.476 --> 22:17.043
Tap wasn't on you.
It was on the mayor.

22:17.045 --> 22:19.212
You just got help
from the wrong person,

22:19.214 --> 22:20.547
got caught.

22:20.549 --> 22:23.150
I don't give a damn
why you stole your own guns.

22:23.152 --> 22:26.353
I just want to get 'em back
before anybody else gets killed.

22:26.355 --> 22:28.088
I didn't steal them.

22:28.090 --> 22:30.190
Then why do you know
where the guns are?

22:30.192 --> 22:32.993
How come you told Hamilton
you can get 'em back?

22:34.796 --> 22:38.932
Unless you start talking,
U.S. attorney's gonna charge you

22:38.934 --> 22:41.568
as a coconspirator,
felony murder.

22:42.905 --> 22:45.739
You don't want to spend
the rest of your life in prison,

22:45.741 --> 22:48.074
talk... fast.

22:50.179 --> 22:52.212
I can't.

22:56.351 --> 22:58.351
Sorry, Pride, but Izzo's here.

22:58.353 --> 23:00.620
She insists on talking to you.

23:00.622 --> 23:03.623
<i>Do you realize how many</i>
<i>hoops I had to jump through</i>

23:03.625 --> 23:06.126
just to get that wiretap granted
in the first place?

23:06.128 --> 23:07.594
I know, Karen, but I had...

23:07.596 --> 23:09.329
No buts, Dwayne.

23:09.331 --> 23:12.899
You based the arrest of
Bancroft on Hamilton's wiretap.

23:12.901 --> 23:15.535
A good defense attorney
will get that kicked easily.

23:15.537 --> 23:17.204
Well, Bancroft
incriminated himself.

23:17.206 --> 23:18.205
What was I supposed to do?

23:18.207 --> 23:19.573
You were supposed to ignore

23:19.575 --> 23:21.408
what you heard, that's what.

23:21.410 --> 23:23.810
Too many guns are missing.
I had to make a choice.

23:23.812 --> 23:25.845
A choice that's probably
gonna cost you

23:25.847 --> 23:27.847
any chance of
bringing down Hamilton.

23:27.849 --> 23:30.917
He's gonna find out,
if he hasn't already.

23:30.919 --> 23:32.319
I'll worry about that later.

23:32.321 --> 23:34.654
No, you need to
worry about that now.

23:34.656 --> 23:38.892
Dwayne, if Mayor Hamilton
is as dirty as you say he is,

23:38.894 --> 23:40.193
he's going to retaliate.

23:40.195 --> 23:41.661
You know he will.

23:41.663 --> 23:44.097
I wasn't gonna let
more people get killed.

23:44.099 --> 23:45.532
You should've called me!

23:45.534 --> 23:47.867
I didn't have time,
I had to act.

23:47.869 --> 23:49.269
I warned you.

23:49.271 --> 23:50.737
I warned you about the risk

23:50.739 --> 23:52.906
of going after a powerful man
like Hamilton,

23:52.908 --> 23:55.508
about blowing the wire.

23:55.510 --> 23:58.011
You have no idea
what you've done.

24:11.126 --> 24:13.560
Well, she doesn't seem happy.

24:13.562 --> 24:15.528
She's not.

24:15.530 --> 24:16.997
But let's stay on point.

24:16.999 --> 24:21.234
Bancroft's not talking,
and I think I know why.

24:21.236 --> 24:24.404
I don't know how he's involved
with the stolen guns,

24:24.406 --> 24:25.939
but there's no question
in my mind

24:25.941 --> 24:27.407
that he knows where they are.

24:27.409 --> 24:29.576
But he still wouldn't tell you?
Nope.

24:29.578 --> 24:32.112
And I think it's because
he's protecting somebody,

24:32.114 --> 24:34.748
somebody he's willing
to go to jail for.

24:34.750 --> 24:36.850
His daughter.

24:36.852 --> 24:38.618
How can Nadine

24:38.620 --> 24:39.986
possibly be involved in this?

24:39.988 --> 24:41.621
Well, she may be
more involved than you think.

24:41.623 --> 24:45.025
I just ran case
and victim profiles

24:45.027 --> 24:46.826
through advanced link
and social network analysis;

24:46.828 --> 24:48.295
guess whose name
lit up the scoreboard.

24:48.297 --> 24:50.030
Nadine Bancroft.

24:50.032 --> 24:51.865
She connects to the case
on several levels, too:

24:51.867 --> 24:55.468
geographic, socioeconomic, age,
schools, social media.

24:55.470 --> 24:56.736
I mean,
all were bridesmaids

24:56.738 --> 24:58.204
at three other
friends' weddings.

24:58.206 --> 24:59.673
Doctors Without Borders,
Marines,

24:59.675 --> 25:01.408
Nadine joined the Peace Corps.

25:01.410 --> 25:04.611
I mean, these are hardly just
a bunch of rich debutantes.

25:04.613 --> 25:06.646
Could explain why nobody's
been able to catch the crew.

25:06.648 --> 25:08.615
Nobody would ever
suspect them, plus...

25:08.617 --> 25:10.850
Nadine would know exactly
how to steal the guns

25:10.852 --> 25:11.985
without getting caught.

25:11.987 --> 25:14.487
Are you seriously
suggesting that

25:14.489 --> 25:16.856
Nadine Bancroft
is part of the heist crew?

25:16.858 --> 25:19.826
That she stole the guns
from her own family? Why?

25:19.828 --> 25:22.996
Don't know, but if her father
found out what she was doing,

25:22.998 --> 25:25.365
makes sense
he's trying to protect her.

25:25.367 --> 25:27.934
And that's why he told Hamilton
he'd get him back the guns.

25:27.936 --> 25:30.870
So, what, Silver Spoon here
is vying for attention?

25:30.872 --> 25:33.573
Rebelling against
how rich they are or something?

25:33.575 --> 25:35.875
Nah, there's got to be another
reason why they're doing this.

25:35.877 --> 25:38.611
Yeah, it's a lot of guns,
whatever the reason.

25:38.613 --> 25:40.347
Problem is, we're never gonna
figure out who's killing off

25:40.349 --> 25:42.082
the heist crew
unless we figure out why.

25:42.084 --> 25:46.419
Which means, they could be
after Nadine next.

25:47.255 --> 25:48.788
Alert NOPD.

25:48.790 --> 25:50.924
Get 'em out to the Bancrofts'.

25:50.926 --> 25:52.125
Let's go.

25:57.799 --> 26:00.066
<i>We're on scene,</i>
<i>Christopher. Stand by.</i>

26:00.068 --> 26:03.069
Copy that. Any sign of Nadine?

26:03.071 --> 26:04.637
<i>No, not yet.</i>

26:06.508 --> 26:07.540
Shots fired!

26:10.178 --> 26:11.611
<i>I think they've got Nadine!</i>

26:11.613 --> 26:12.979
<i>We're in pursuit!</i>

26:12.981 --> 26:13.980
They're coming your way!

26:13.982 --> 26:15.181
Box 'em in!

26:15.183 --> 26:16.783
<i>We're almost there.</i>

26:18.620 --> 26:21.054
<i>Here they come!</i>
<i>We got 'em, Pride!</i>

26:32.033 --> 26:33.900
Drop, Nadine!

26:45.213 --> 26:47.113
You're okay.

26:47.816 --> 26:50.850
You're okay. You're okay.

27:04.010 --> 27:06.778
Hate to rush you,
Loretta, but...

27:06.780 --> 27:09.080
please tell me
you can help us identify...

27:09.082 --> 27:10.682
They're Boko Haram.

27:12.018 --> 27:13.751
At least, that's the particular
terrorist group

27:13.753 --> 27:15.153
these two gunmen belonged to.

27:15.155 --> 27:17.856
Boko Haram in New Orleans?

27:17.858 --> 27:19.190
Are you sure?

27:19.192 --> 27:20.925
Unfortunately, I am.

27:20.927 --> 27:24.062
Notice the scarring
from forehead to nose,

27:24.064 --> 27:26.598
the two rectilinear
lines down the cheeks.

27:26.600 --> 27:28.066
Tribal scars.

27:28.068 --> 27:32.437
Many African ethnic groups use
distinctive facial markings--

27:32.439 --> 27:37.408
Yoruba, Igbo, Hausa--
but these men are Kanuri.

27:37.410 --> 27:40.111
Heavily recruited by Boko Haram.

27:40.113 --> 27:42.380
I couldn't believe it
myself until

27:42.382 --> 27:45.850
I saw the keloid tattoo
on their ankles.

27:45.852 --> 27:47.719
“BH.”

27:47.721 --> 27:49.854
You know how much time
I've spent

27:49.856 --> 27:51.489
volunteering in Africa, Dwayne.

27:51.491 --> 27:53.324
I've witnessed firsthand

27:53.326 --> 27:55.026
the horrors
these animals perpetrate

27:55.028 --> 27:56.527
on innocent women and children.

27:56.529 --> 27:58.263
I know, Loretta.

27:58.265 --> 28:00.465
We're gonna do everything we can
to stop them.

28:00.467 --> 28:01.599
Yeah,
the question is:

28:01.601 --> 28:03.368
what are they doing here?

28:03.370 --> 28:06.104
And why are they killing
the heist crew?

28:06.106 --> 28:08.439
They must want the guns.

28:08.441 --> 28:10.341
But still, how'd they
know Nadine and her crew

28:10.343 --> 28:12.243
were gonna steal the
guns in the first place?

28:12.245 --> 28:13.578
I don't know.

28:13.580 --> 28:15.346
Maybe Nadine
could tell us.

28:15.348 --> 28:17.615
Let the rest of the team know
we're heading back.

28:17.617 --> 28:19.150
Have Gregorio

28:19.152 --> 28:21.219
alert DHS and FBI.

28:21.221 --> 28:23.988
Doubt these are the only
two members of the hit squad,

28:23.990 --> 28:26.858
which means we could use a lot
of help finding the others.

28:26.860 --> 28:28.459
On it.

28:30.597 --> 28:33.531
Must've taken Nadine
instead of killing her

28:33.533 --> 28:36.534
in hopes that she would tell 'em
where the guns were hidden.

28:36.536 --> 28:39.604
No doubt by
torturing her.

28:39.606 --> 28:40.805
What do you mean?

28:40.807 --> 28:42.206
From the Marine.

28:42.208 --> 28:45.944
Torn ligaments,
antemortem bruising.

28:45.946 --> 28:48.012
I didn't see it
in the prelim,

28:48.014 --> 28:50.715
but the poor woman
was clearly tortured

28:50.717 --> 28:52.483
before she was executed.

28:52.485 --> 28:55.420
They would've gotten
everything they wanted from her.

28:55.422 --> 28:57.655
Dwayne,

28:57.657 --> 28:59.891
you've got to get
these bastards.

28:59.893 --> 29:01.960
But be careful.

29:06.466 --> 29:10.034
You saved my life,
and I'm grateful.

29:10.036 --> 29:12.370
But I can't tell you
where the guns are.

29:12.372 --> 29:14.305
Okay, I
don't understand.

29:14.307 --> 29:17.075
You stole
your father's guns.

29:17.077 --> 29:19.243
Two of your friends
were killed,

29:19.245 --> 29:20.979
you were nearly killed,

29:20.981 --> 29:24.115
and you won't
cooperate with us?

29:24.117 --> 29:26.517
Who do you think you are?

29:26.519 --> 29:28.987
Doesn't matter,
you won't believe me.

29:28.989 --> 29:31.489
Try me.

29:33.293 --> 29:37.161
Emma and I visited Jo in
Sudan a couple of years ago.

29:37.163 --> 29:39.030
We were shocked.

29:39.032 --> 29:41.232
It couldn't have been more
different than here--

29:41.234 --> 29:44.869
war-torn, famine.

29:44.871 --> 29:47.872
Place is a
humanitarian disaster.

29:47.874 --> 29:51.075
We volunteered to help
villagers set up

29:51.077 --> 29:53.311
a girls' school
in Khartoum,

29:53.313 --> 29:55.680
but then Boko Haram attacked.

29:55.682 --> 29:57.448
We were whisked

29:57.450 --> 30:00.284
into the embassy
for safety, but...

30:00.286 --> 30:04.622
we watched the attack keep
happening through the gates.

30:06.092 --> 30:08.459
And nobody tried to stop it.

30:09.729 --> 30:12.363
Women being raped,

30:12.365 --> 30:14.532
children being shot.

30:15.902 --> 30:18.236
And there was nothing
we could do.

30:20.106 --> 30:23.041
You don't ever unsee
something like that.

30:26.846 --> 30:29.047
Guns are for the villagers.

30:30.283 --> 30:31.949
To protect themselves.

30:31.951 --> 30:33.718
'Cause nobody else will.

30:33.720 --> 30:36.154
But Boko Haram
must've found out

30:36.156 --> 30:37.255
what we've been doing,

30:37.257 --> 30:39.123
so they came here
to try and stop us.

30:39.125 --> 30:41.459
It's a noble cause,

30:41.461 --> 30:44.896
but it's-it's
completely illegal.

30:44.898 --> 30:47.065
Stealing guns,

30:47.067 --> 30:50.601
smuggling them
out of the country...

30:50.603 --> 30:54.672
breaks 15 federal laws,
you know that.

30:56.276 --> 30:59.677
You're really willing to risk
your life for this, aren't you?

30:59.679 --> 31:02.013
Yes, I am.

31:04.484 --> 31:06.250
If you don't
let me go,

31:06.252 --> 31:08.352
get the villagers those guns...

31:09.389 --> 31:11.289
...Boko Haram
will keep attacking them

31:11.291 --> 31:13.124
until they're all dead.

31:14.527 --> 31:17.095
Can you really live with that?

31:25.438 --> 31:27.305
We have to find
a way to help her.

31:27.307 --> 31:29.040
Well, there's no way
to help her, Sonja.

31:29.042 --> 31:30.174
We can't let her go.

31:30.176 --> 31:31.509
But what if Nadine's right?

31:31.511 --> 31:33.211
We can't just
let those people die.

31:33.213 --> 31:34.312
It's halfway around the world.

31:34.314 --> 31:35.413
There's people like that
everywhere,

31:35.415 --> 31:36.714
we can't help 'em all.

31:36.716 --> 31:38.749
Yeah, but we know
about these people

31:38.751 --> 31:40.718
and can do something about it.

31:40.720 --> 31:42.887
Helping Nadine
means breaking the law.

31:42.889 --> 31:44.288
So? We've risked
breaking the law before

31:44.290 --> 31:45.490
to do the right thing.

31:45.492 --> 31:47.091
Not like this.
This is different.

31:47.093 --> 31:48.960
How? How is this different?

31:48.962 --> 31:50.361
If you have to ask,

31:50.363 --> 31:51.596
you're not thinking straight.

31:51.598 --> 31:52.997
Now take a breath.

31:52.999 --> 31:54.499
Seems like

31:54.501 --> 31:56.300
we're danged if we do
and danged if we don't.

31:56.302 --> 31:58.102
I mean, if we don't
do something,

31:58.104 --> 32:00.972
the terrorists are gonna get
their hands on them guns anyway.

32:00.974 --> 32:02.773
Yeah, and probably use them
against the very people

32:02.775 --> 32:03.941
Nadine's trying to save.

32:03.943 --> 32:05.743
Nadine knows we know that, too,

32:05.745 --> 32:08.012
probably hoping we'll let her go
because of it.

32:08.014 --> 32:09.814
It's a catch-22.

32:09.816 --> 32:12.049
All right,

32:12.051 --> 32:13.784
we'll let her go.

32:14.854 --> 32:17.522
But only to follow her
so she leads us to the guns.

32:17.524 --> 32:19.257
Wait, you mean
we're gonna trick her?

32:19.259 --> 32:22.493
No, not trying to trick her,
trying to save her life

32:22.495 --> 32:24.295
and keep Boko Haram
from getting those guns.

32:24.297 --> 32:27.798
And that's gonna have to be
enough for you.

32:28.935 --> 32:30.835
Clear?

32:45.398 --> 32:46.745
<i>Nadine's still</i>
<i>heading east towards</i>

32:46.746 --> 32:48.579
<i>Stars and Stripes Boulevard,</i>

32:48.581 --> 32:50.381
<i>going about 15 miles</i>
<i>over the speed limit,</i>

32:50.383 --> 32:52.216
in case you want to
add that to the charges.

32:52.218 --> 32:53.418
Think she's heading
to the airport?

32:53.420 --> 32:54.819
I hope not,

32:54.821 --> 32:56.287
'cause all the RF
and cell signals

32:56.289 --> 32:58.456
might screw up the geotracker
you put in her coat.

32:58.458 --> 32:59.824
Counting on you, Patton.

32:59.826 --> 33:01.726
We got to stay close enough
to protect her

33:01.728 --> 33:02.927
in case the terrorists attack,

33:02.929 --> 33:04.696
but not so close
that she spots us.

33:04.698 --> 33:06.397
I wonder why they haven't
attacked her yet.

33:06.399 --> 33:07.899
Maybe they already
found the guns,

33:07.901 --> 33:09.701
and if so, they don't
need to follow her.

33:09.703 --> 33:11.135
Except they didn't come
for the guns first,

33:11.137 --> 33:12.537
they came for Nadine.

33:12.539 --> 33:15.373
Don't worry, we're not gonna let
anything happen to her.

33:15.375 --> 33:18.042
Just remember, as soon
as she leads us to the guns,

33:18.044 --> 33:20.244
we got to get Nadine,

33:20.246 --> 33:22.080
get the guns,
and then get out of there.

33:22.082 --> 33:23.381
Especially if they
already found them.

33:23.383 --> 33:25.016
They could be lying
in wait for her.

33:25.018 --> 33:26.718
She's getting off on Crofton.

33:26.720 --> 33:29.053
She might be headed
to the charter hangars.

33:29.055 --> 33:31.255
Damn it,
her signal's breaking up.

33:31.257 --> 33:33.358
We got to close the gap.

33:36.963 --> 33:39.497
I don't know about this,
Christopher.

33:39.499 --> 33:42.266
I still can't believe
we're gonna arrest her.

33:42.268 --> 33:46.104
King made the call.
Let's just do our jobs.

33:55.548 --> 33:57.448
The storage pods were
supposed to be unloaded

33:57.450 --> 33:59.717
and on the plane by now.
I can't wait that long.

33:59.719 --> 34:01.486
I'm sorry, Nadine,
but we got delayed

34:01.488 --> 34:02.520
getting to the airport.

34:02.522 --> 34:04.956
Wait. Something's happened.

34:04.958 --> 34:06.257
Where are the guns?

34:06.259 --> 34:08.025
What do you mean,
where are the guns?

34:08.027 --> 34:09.460
Nadine, what's wrong?

34:09.462 --> 34:10.895
Is everything okay?

34:10.897 --> 34:12.597
Nadine? Nadine!

34:16.469 --> 34:18.302
Hey!

34:18.304 --> 34:20.405
What are you doing...

34:45.732 --> 34:47.498
Nadine, stop!

34:47.500 --> 34:48.498
You followed me.

34:48.501 --> 34:50.168
Yeah, and saved your life again.

34:51.271 --> 34:53.337
Run to the terminal.
I'm gonna run farther than that.

34:53.339 --> 34:55.339
Boko Haram's gonna retaliate
against the villagers for this.

34:55.341 --> 34:58.709
If I can't get them guns,
at least let me warn them,

34:58.711 --> 35:00.011
move them.

35:02.248 --> 35:03.648
I have the means.

35:03.650 --> 35:05.750
I can easily leave the
country if you let me.

35:05.752 --> 35:07.685
No, I'm sorry, Nadine, I can't.

35:07.687 --> 35:09.687
Please.

35:24.704 --> 35:25.937
Percy, you good?

35:40.687 --> 35:42.220
How's Nadine?

35:46.226 --> 35:47.725
Where is she?

35:49.562 --> 35:50.962
Sh-She got away.

35:50.964 --> 35:53.331
Stay with him.

36:05.178 --> 36:07.879
I want to know what
happened out there today.

36:07.881 --> 36:09.914
I told you
what I know, Pride.

36:09.916 --> 36:13.017
You told me what
you want me to know.

36:13.019 --> 36:15.319
No way Nadine got
away from you.

36:15.321 --> 36:18.256
Damn it, Sonja,

36:18.258 --> 36:22.593
I worked too hard to rebuild
this team after Brody left.

36:22.595 --> 36:24.228
Stronger than ever.

36:24.230 --> 36:26.831
How could you be so willing
to risk throwing it all away?

36:26.833 --> 36:30.251
This team means as much, if not
more, to you than to anybody.

36:30.252 --> 36:31.166
I know that.

36:31.190 --> 36:33.150
Then why the hell won't you
tell me what happened?

36:33.806 --> 36:35.606
What difference does it make?

36:35.608 --> 36:37.575
We got the terrorists,
didn't we?

36:37.577 --> 36:39.076
And the guns.

36:39.078 --> 36:40.578
Nadine is not the bad guy.

36:40.580 --> 36:42.713
Then how come half
of law enforcement's

36:42.715 --> 36:44.782
still out there looking for her?

36:48.721 --> 36:53.024
If I told you, Pride, and
anybody outside of this office

36:53.026 --> 36:54.592
found out,

36:54.594 --> 36:56.360
you would get in trouble, too.

36:56.362 --> 36:57.828
I can't let that happen.

36:57.830 --> 36:59.363
I'm already in trouble.

36:59.365 --> 37:01.732
I sacrificed Hamilton
for this.

37:01.734 --> 37:04.235
God only knows
how he's gonna retaliate.

37:06.873 --> 37:08.706
This is serious, Sonja.

37:10.543 --> 37:13.477
Not just legally.

37:13.479 --> 37:16.747
You cannot cherry-pick
which orders to follow--

37:16.749 --> 37:18.216
not on my watch.

37:18.218 --> 37:19.850
That is not what a team is.

37:19.852 --> 37:21.252
And I won't stand for it.

37:21.254 --> 37:24.222
And we've had
this conversation before.

37:26.993 --> 37:29.260
What happened to Nadine?

37:39.572 --> 37:42.840
I'm sorry.

37:42.842 --> 37:45.009
I can't.

37:49.582 --> 37:52.550
That'll be all.

38:03.329 --> 38:05.062
Hey.

38:05.064 --> 38:07.565
Hey.

38:07.567 --> 38:09.000
You waited for me?

38:09.002 --> 38:11.235
Well, I was a little worried.

38:11.237 --> 38:13.371
Everything all right?

38:13.373 --> 38:15.940
I don't know.

38:15.942 --> 38:18.276
Pride is pretty pissed.

38:18.278 --> 38:21.212
Can't say I blame him.

38:21.214 --> 38:24.015
And I... I don't know
what he's gonna do yet.

38:24.017 --> 38:26.217
What does that mean?
Do what?

38:26.219 --> 38:29.687
I don't know if he's
gonna report me to HQ.

38:29.689 --> 38:31.722
King's not gonna do that.

38:31.724 --> 38:33.357
He knows you'll be done for.

38:33.359 --> 38:37.128
Yeah, like I said,
he's pretty pissed.

38:39.232 --> 38:41.198
Well, did you tell him
what really happened?

38:41.200 --> 38:43.467
What, you're trying
to find out, too?

38:45.405 --> 38:48.105
Don't you trust me?

38:51.244 --> 38:53.077
Were you jealous?

38:54.681 --> 38:57.481
Guy in the coffee shop.

38:57.483 --> 39:00.418
Now, what does that
got to do with...

39:00.420 --> 39:02.953
Ah, you can't expect me
to trust you

39:02.955 --> 39:04.822
if you don't trust me, right?

39:06.726 --> 39:10.261
Well, honestly, I don't
know what I felt.

39:10.263 --> 39:13.030
I...

39:13.032 --> 39:15.666
Maybe I could have
been a little jealous.

39:17.537 --> 39:20.338
And maybe I could have
let Nadine go.

39:22.475 --> 39:25.609
Hey, look, I don't need
a lecture from you, Christopher,

39:25.611 --> 39:28.846
and I don't want this
to bite you in the ass later,

39:28.848 --> 39:30.448
so please,

39:30.450 --> 39:32.983
don't ask me
any more questions, okay?

39:34.454 --> 39:35.720
Okay.

39:35.722 --> 39:38.723
Come on, let's
get out of here.

39:40.126 --> 39:41.692
Percy.

39:43.129 --> 39:46.664
Just got off the phone with
Assistant U.S. Attorney Izzo.

39:47.734 --> 39:50.034
Judge wants us both
downtown now.

40:01.280 --> 40:02.613
The evidence
clearly contradicts

40:02.615 --> 40:04.648
Agent Percy's statement
to the court.

40:04.650 --> 40:06.150
You lied.

40:06.152 --> 40:07.985
No. See...

40:07.987 --> 40:10.855
the team was in the middle
of a firefight. I...

40:10.857 --> 40:13.157
You said in
your sworn statement,

40:13.159 --> 40:16.394
and I quote,
“Nadine Bancroft got away.”

40:16.396 --> 40:19.830
Clearly, you could have arrested
her right then and there.

40:19.832 --> 40:21.665
Cuffed her before
you went back in.

40:21.667 --> 40:24.168
I was worried about my team.

40:25.838 --> 40:27.338
I made a judgment call.

40:27.340 --> 40:28.639
You let a felon escape.

40:28.641 --> 40:31.375
Okay, hold on.

40:31.377 --> 40:34.445
Just out of curiosity...

40:34.447 --> 40:36.714
what made you think
to look for surveillance?

40:36.716 --> 40:38.015
That's not the point.

40:38.017 --> 40:40.184
It is if this is more about
retribution than justice.

40:41.320 --> 40:43.120
Are you condoning your agent's
behavior, Agent Pride?

40:43.122 --> 40:46.056
I'm not condoning a witch hunt,
if that's what you're asking.

40:46.058 --> 40:48.492
What the hell are
you two talking about?

40:48.494 --> 40:51.362
Your Honor, Agent Pride
and Mayor Hamilton

40:51.364 --> 40:52.663
don't exactly get along.

40:52.665 --> 40:54.198
And what does that
have to do with this?

40:54.200 --> 40:56.934
Because when the mayor
heard about what happened,

40:56.936 --> 40:59.837
he asked the inspector general
to open an investigation.

40:59.839 --> 41:02.406
Retribution for
my investigating him.

41:02.408 --> 41:04.241
Conjecture.
Like hell it is!

41:04.243 --> 41:05.242
Enough.

41:05.244 --> 41:06.811
You two can argue
about this later.

41:06.813 --> 41:08.879
But it doesn't change
the facts.

41:09.982 --> 41:12.116
You're in serious trouble,
young lady.

41:12.118 --> 41:13.250
Because as far as
I'm concerned,

41:13.252 --> 41:15.286
you're not telling me the truth.

41:15.288 --> 41:18.088
You have one last chance.

41:18.090 --> 41:21.292
I want to know why you didn't
arrest Nadine Bancroft,

41:21.294 --> 41:23.360
and I want to know
where she is,

41:23.362 --> 41:25.696
or I'm gonna charge you
with perjury

41:25.698 --> 41:28.232
and hold you in contempt.

41:28.234 --> 41:30.167
Do you understand?

41:35.041 --> 41:37.475
Karen, Karen,
come on, come on.

41:37.477 --> 41:39.643
Why are you doing this?

41:39.645 --> 41:40.878
Don't blame me, Dwayne.

41:40.880 --> 41:42.346
Your agent brought
this on herself.

41:42.348 --> 41:43.814
I'm just doing my job.

41:43.816 --> 41:45.950
Yeah, more like doing
Hamilton's bidding.

41:45.952 --> 41:48.452
Didn't realize that you were
in the mayor's pocket, too.

41:48.454 --> 41:49.653
You know that's not true.

41:49.655 --> 41:50.688
Do I?

41:50.690 --> 41:51.922
Bottom line:

41:51.924 --> 41:54.158
your agent screwed up,
and Hamilton pounced.

41:54.160 --> 41:57.228
I warned you what would happen
if he found out about the wire.

41:57.230 --> 41:58.529
