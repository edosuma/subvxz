00:44.210 --> 00:46.915
# Bring out what's been in me #

00:46.915 --> 00:49.543
# Far too long #

00:49.543 --> 00:51.127
# And, uh... #

00:51.127 --> 00:57.718
# That's all
I've been dreaming of #

00:57.718 --> 01:00.345
# Do me, baby #

01:00.345 --> 01:03.686
# Like you never done before #

01:03.686 --> 01:07.224
# Ahh, ooh, give it to me #

01:07.224 --> 01:10.437
# Till I just can't take no more #

01:10.437 --> 01:16.734
# Come on, do me, baby,
like you never done before #

01:16.734 --> 01:20.872
# Ahh, ooh, I want you, babe #

01:20.872 --> 01:24.456
# Like I just can't take no more #

01:24.456 --> 01:27.414
# Ooh, ahh #

01:27.414 --> 01:31.089
# Hooh-ooh ooh! #

01:31.089 --> 01:34.260
# Ooooooooh! #

01:34.972 --> 01:35.885
Whoo!

01:35.885 --> 01:36.966
What the hell are you doing?

01:36.966 --> 01:38.466
What the hell?!

01:38.466 --> 01:40.764
I didn't tell you to go!
Goddamn!

01:40.764 --> 01:42.262
- It was him!
- That was you!

01:43.229 --> 01:45.352
Shit! Oh, man!

01:45.352 --> 01:47.397
Ain't nobody listenin' today.

01:47.397 --> 01:51.101
Ladies, you just dented
a '81 Cutlass Supreme.

01:51.101 --> 01:52.903
I need to see your license
and registration.

01:52.903 --> 01:54.566
Brother, you OK? You cool?

02:03.249 --> 02:05.787
Ten minutes.
Doors open on my signal.

02:05.787 --> 02:07.336
I'm glad you're here, Lee.

02:07.336 --> 02:09.793
I always feel better
with you watching my back.

02:09.793 --> 02:13.001
I'm just doing my job,
Mr. Ambassador.

02:13.001 --> 02:15.003
Stay close today, Lee.

02:15.003 --> 02:16.209
We're making history.

02:19.474 --> 02:21.966
This is bullshit!
Do you know who I am?

02:21.966 --> 02:24.219
My family owns
half of Rodeo Drive.

02:24.219 --> 02:25.808
Do you know who I am?

02:25.808 --> 02:28.021
Detective James Carter, LAPD.

02:28.021 --> 02:29.934
My family owns half of
Crenshaw Boulevard.

02:29.934 --> 02:30.940
I want a lawyer.

02:30.940 --> 02:32.438
You need a personal trainer.

02:32.438 --> 02:33.808
This license says 180 pounds.

02:33.808 --> 02:35.234
You weigh more than
the damn car, girl.

02:35.234 --> 02:37.649
- I have a thyroid condition.
- Well, stop eating thyroids.

02:37.649 --> 02:41.822
Look, can't you just,
like give us a warning or something?

02:41.822 --> 02:45.364
That depends.
You girls like Chinese?

02:48.211 --> 02:49.955
Excuse me.

02:49.955 --> 02:51.162
Carter.

02:51.162 --> 02:52.715
Lee, we are on for tonight.

02:52.715 --> 02:55.753
I just picked up two girls who wanna
play hide the little Asian policeman.

02:55.753 --> 02:58.418
I can't talk now. I'm in the car
with Ambassador Han.

02:58.418 --> 03:00.173
Trust me, these girls
are sushi grade.

03:00.173 --> 03:02.472
- We gotta hit this!
- I have to go. I'm sorry.

03:02.472 --> 03:04.019
You're still mad at me, aren't you?

03:04.019 --> 03:06.392
You're mad because of what happened
when we was in New York.

03:06.392 --> 03:07.477
I don't want to talk about that.

03:07.477 --> 03:09.854
It was three years ago.
When you gonna let it go?

03:09.854 --> 03:12.398
Let it go? Isabella was my girlfriend.

03:12.398 --> 03:13.400
Lee, we're friends, man.

03:13.400 --> 03:14.650
Just come out with me one night.

03:14.650 --> 03:16.648
The mu shu's on me.

03:16.648 --> 03:18.365
Lee!

03:18.993 --> 03:20.157
Ha.

03:20.157 --> 03:22.200
My mom says hi.

03:23.997 --> 03:27.283
World Criminal Court

03:50.191 --> 03:53.525
The Chinese triads now have
half a million members...

03:53.525 --> 03:56.067
in over 100 countries.

03:56.067 --> 03:59.737
And these are not street kids shaking down
local merchants.

03:59.737 --> 04:04.120
These are businessmen who have built
a $50 billion empire...

04:04.120 --> 04:07.906
of extortion, drugs,
sex and slavery.

04:07.906 --> 04:13.290
We must cut off the head of this snake
before it swallows us whole.

04:13.290 --> 04:15.456
As chairman of
the World Criminal Court...

04:15.456 --> 04:19.334
I have entrusted my good friend
Ambassador Han to lead the fight...

04:19.334 --> 04:22.383
against the largest criminal
organization in the world.

04:30.440 --> 04:32.598
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

04:37.072 --> 04:40.238
Chairman Reynard,
ladies and gentlemen.

04:42.827 --> 04:46.411
The triad society
is built on secrecy.

04:46.411 --> 04:50.746
Nobody knows who these men are,
who controls them, who leads them.

04:50.746 --> 04:53.243
Nobody has known for 500 years.

04:53.243 --> 04:57.086
But today, I stand before you
with a secret of my own.

04:57.086 --> 05:01.803
Today, I will disclose information
that affects everyone in this room.

05:01.803 --> 05:06.431
After years of searching,
I believe I've finally located Shy Shen.

05:07.227 --> 05:10.927
Mr. Ambassador,
Shy Shen does not exist.

05:10.927 --> 05:13.940
Excuse me, who is this Shy Shen?

05:13.940 --> 05:15.520
With all due respect, sir, I le...

05:25.704 --> 05:28.160
Everybody down!

05:28.160 --> 05:29.791
Call an ambulance!

05:29.791 --> 05:30.905
Someone get a doctor.

05:30.905 --> 05:32.994
Ambassador down,
Ambassador down.

05:32.994 --> 05:34.462
Stay with him.

05:49.436 --> 05:50.552
Yugh!

06:09.499 --> 06:11.075
Uh-uh-uh. Keepin' these
till I see you tonight.

06:11.075 --> 06:13.492
Attention all units, shots have been fired
at the World Criminal Court building.

06:13.492 --> 06:15.578
The Chinese Ambassador
has been shot.

06:15.578 --> 06:17.082
Chinese Ambassador?
Move your asses over.

06:17.082 --> 06:19.166
- Move over!
- What? Whoa. Shit!

06:59.549 --> 07:00.498
What're you doing?!

07:00.498 --> 07:01.968
Lee!

07:06.389 --> 07:07.883
- Where the hell is he goin'?
- Ah!

07:10.977 --> 07:12.970
LAPD! Get the hell outta the way!

07:12.970 --> 07:14.724
People are crazy.

07:16.608 --> 07:18.731
I'm-a give your ass a ticket
when I come back!

07:42.383 --> 07:43.925
Lee, I'm comin'!

07:52.645 --> 07:54.351
Ugh!

07:59.818 --> 08:01.443
Don't move!

08:05.950 --> 08:07.740
Hello, Lee.

08:16.336 --> 08:17.746
Don't move, Kenji.

08:18.171 --> 08:22.382
Lee, what're you waiting for?
Shoot me!

08:27.430 --> 08:29.138
Maybe this will help.

08:35.979 --> 08:38.186
Drop the gun or I'll shoot!

08:38.690 --> 08:41.645
I think we both know
that's not gonna happen.

08:46.656 --> 08:47.736
Kenji!

08:49.201 --> 08:52.238
You see?
I know you too well.

08:56.834 --> 08:58.579
Aaaah!

09:03.091 --> 09:05.048
- Ugh!
- Aaaah!

09:07.637 --> 09:09.962
- Ungh.
- Lee, you OK?

09:12.725 --> 09:15.347
We almost killed your ass.
Why you didn't move?

09:15.347 --> 09:17.015
Ohh.

09:17.015 --> 09:21.020
I'd like for you to meet our dates
for this evenin'. Masha and Zoe.

09:21.020 --> 09:22.023
Urgh.

09:22.023 --> 09:23.605
Fat one's yours.

09:28.991 --> 09:31.233
How many times
do you want me to say it? I'm sorry.

09:31.233 --> 09:33.119
I'm sorry I ran you over, man. Damn!

09:33.119 --> 09:34.449
- Not now, Carter.
- Aww.

09:34.449 --> 09:37.457
All right, hold it right there.
Don't say a word, Carter.

09:37.457 --> 09:39.581
Captain Diel, I had nothin'
to do with this.

09:39.581 --> 09:41.708
All I did was borrow a car,
backed up Lee.

09:41.708 --> 09:42.745
Tell him, partner.

09:42.745 --> 09:44.250
I need to see Ambassador Han.

09:44.250 --> 09:46.499
The Ambassador
is just out of surgery.

09:46.499 --> 09:49.131
The bullet missed his heart.
He's gonna be OK.

09:49.131 --> 09:50.799
Captain, you have to give me
back my shield...

09:50.799 --> 09:52.680
and put me on this case.
I made one little mistake.

09:52.680 --> 09:54.924
- Take a brother off the bench.
- One little mistake?

09:54.924 --> 09:56.678
You handcuffed two women
and stole their car.

09:56.678 --> 09:58.348
Isn't that why we have insurance?

09:58.348 --> 10:00.063
Everyone has
an off day, Captain.

10:00.063 --> 10:02.687
Last month you put
six Iranians in jail for a week!

10:02.687 --> 10:05.349
You and I both know
them Iranians was terrorists.

10:05.349 --> 10:07.568
They were scientists at UCLA!

10:07.568 --> 10:08.688
Big deal.

10:08.688 --> 10:10.063
'Cause they cure cancer in rats...

10:10.063 --> 10:11.951
that doesn't mean
they won't blow shit up.

10:11.951 --> 10:13.696
Let me find the person
who shot Ambassador Han.

10:13.696 --> 10:16.706
Relax, Carter. The LAPD won't be leading
this investigation.

10:16.706 --> 10:18.747
The Ambassador
is my responsibility.

10:18.747 --> 10:21.538
Well, then maybe you could
tell me exactly how that shooter got away.

10:23.004 --> 10:23.918
Thought so.

10:23.918 --> 10:27.422
The Ambassador's daughter
is coming to see her father right now.

10:27.422 --> 10:29.383
Make sure nothing happens to her.

10:29.383 --> 10:31.545
Don't worry, Captain,
we're gonna make you proud.

10:31.545 --> 10:33.631
And try not to think about
your wife leaving you.

10:33.631 --> 10:35.135
She'll come back.

10:35.135 --> 10:36.684
Soo Yung's here?

10:36.684 --> 10:38.428
I haven't seen her
since she was ten years old.

10:38.428 --> 10:40.514
She lives in Los Angeles now.

10:40.514 --> 10:42.765
Let's go to the gift shop
and get her a little teddy bear.

10:45.403 --> 10:46.517
And a bra.

10:46.517 --> 10:47.526
- Lee!
- Soo Yung.

10:47.526 --> 10:49.273
I'm so glad you're here.

10:50.992 --> 10:52.700
- Detective Carter.
- Soo Yung.

10:52.700 --> 10:55.491
- It's been so long.
- So long, Soo Yung.

10:55.491 --> 10:56.777
So... So young.

10:58.082 --> 11:00.573
- How is he?
- He's out of surgery.

11:00.573 --> 11:02.625
They said he'll be OK.

11:05.215 --> 11:06.923
Soo Yung, I'm sorry.

11:08.051 --> 11:12.343
It was my fault.
I didn't get to him fast enough.

11:16.476 --> 11:18.764
I want you both
to promise me something.

11:20.020 --> 11:22.890
I want you to find the man
who did this to him.

11:22.890 --> 11:25.022
I want you to find him because
I don't think he'll stop...

11:25.022 --> 11:26.484
until my father is dead.

11:27.529 --> 11:28.809
Soo Yung.

11:28.809 --> 11:30.897
I need to hear you say it.

11:32.200 --> 11:33.908
OK, I promise.

11:33.908 --> 11:34.943
And so do I.

11:39.123 --> 11:40.784
Thank you.

11:40.784 --> 11:45.253
Soo Yung, your father was addressing
the court before he was shot.

11:45.253 --> 11:48.789
Two weeks ago, my father
mailed me an envelope.

11:48.789 --> 11:50.793
He said if anything ever
happened to him...

11:50.793 --> 11:53.092
- I should give it to you.
- Where is it?

11:53.092 --> 11:56.880
I put it in my locker
at the kung-fu studio where I teach.

11:56.880 --> 12:01.555
It's at 8347 First Street...

12:01.555 --> 12:03.520
Chinatown.

12:14.076 --> 12:16.613
Go home, Carter.
This has nothing to do with you.

12:16.613 --> 12:18.826
I made Soo Yung a promise,
the same as you.

12:18.826 --> 12:21.452
This is the business of China.

12:21.452 --> 12:24.033
Well, for your information,
I'm part Chinese now.

12:24.033 --> 12:26.037
That's right, Lee.
For the last three years I've studied...

12:26.037 --> 12:28.121
the ancient teachings of Buddha,
earning two black belts...

12:28.121 --> 12:30.006
in wushu martial arts,
spending every afternoon...

12:30.006 --> 12:32.417
at the Hong Kong Garden massage parlour
on Pico and Bundy.

12:32.417 --> 12:33.839
I am half-Chinese, baby.

12:33.839 --> 12:36.337
If you're half-Chinese,
I'm half-black.

12:36.337 --> 12:39.433
I'm your brother and I'm fly.
You down with that, Snoopy?

12:39.433 --> 12:40.976
That's dope, isn't it?

12:40.976 --> 12:44.015
Sorry, Lee, you can't be black.
There's a height requirement.

12:44.015 --> 12:45.269
Same as riding the Matterhorn.

12:45.269 --> 12:46.388
Go home, Carter.

12:46.388 --> 12:47.812
I can't leave you, Lee.

12:49.988 --> 12:51.268
Can't leave my brother.

13:12.134 --> 13:15.800
All right, listen up!
I need everyone's attention.

13:15.800 --> 13:19.222
I'm Detective Carter,
this is Inspector Lee.

13:19.222 --> 13:22.144
We need to see Soo Yung's
locker right now.

13:22.144 --> 13:24.933
No one's allowed in the back
without the master's permission.

13:24.933 --> 13:29.021
Maybe you didn't hear me.
We need to see that locker.

13:29.021 --> 13:31.150
- I'm sorry.
- Wait. Carter.

13:31.780 --> 13:32.977
Lee, I got this.

13:34.073 --> 13:36.315
Hey! Heh heh. Kids.

13:36.315 --> 13:39.280
Listen. Violence will solve nothin'.

13:39.280 --> 13:42.621
Now, as the Chinese say, all great battles
are won without fightin'.

13:42.621 --> 13:43.906
- Sorry.
- OK?

13:43.906 --> 13:45.164
I don't know him.

13:45.164 --> 13:46.281
Now, let's just calm down
and put this...

13:46.281 --> 13:47.491
- Haa!
- Ow!

13:47.491 --> 13:48.997
God da...

13:52.049 --> 13:54.089
OK...

13:54.089 --> 13:55.885
I tried talkin'.

13:56.804 --> 13:59.473
Hoo! Now I'm about to beat
the puberty out of y'all.

13:59.473 --> 14:02.308
You ain't gonna see it comin'.
You ain't gonna see it comin', come on!

14:02.308 --> 14:04.469
Waaa! Whoo!

14:04.469 --> 14:06.472
Runnin' for your lives.

14:06.472 --> 14:09.187
About time y'all showed
some respect around here.

14:10.903 --> 14:13.309
- Huh?
- Carter, wait for the master.

14:17.742 --> 14:20.946
Whoa! Damn!

14:20.946 --> 14:23.659
Heh, I'm sorry, man.
I thought this was the bathroom.

14:23.659 --> 14:24.946
Sorry.

14:24.946 --> 14:27.995
Lee, I got a big problem, man.

14:27.995 --> 14:30.411
This boy's on steroids.
He got a head like Barry Bonds.

14:30.411 --> 14:31.668
- Oh, no.
- Come on, man.

14:31.668 --> 14:33.750
- Aaaah!
- Aaaaah!

14:33.750 --> 14:34.839
Ah!

14:34.839 --> 14:36.754
Carter, are you OK?

14:36.754 --> 14:38.552
Lee, Lee, get him, Lee!

14:38.552 --> 14:39.551
Ooh!

14:39.551 --> 14:41.216
Ahhh! Ah!

14:41.216 --> 14:41.999
Ah!

14:42.726 --> 14:44.184
Urgh!

14:44.184 --> 14:45.893
Lee, let's get the hell outta...

14:45.893 --> 14:47.438
Aah! My bunions!

14:48.481 --> 14:50.558
Yah! Hyah! Mm! Ungh!

14:50.558 --> 14:52.607
- Grr! Rargh!
- Ha ha ha.

14:52.607 --> 14:54.983
Urgh! Whoo!

14:54.983 --> 14:56.447
Oh! Aaaah!

14:56.447 --> 14:58.608
Come on, man, let me go.
I love Chinese people!

14:58.608 --> 15:00.243
Aaaah!

15:00.243 --> 15:01.442
Wait. I don't...

15:10.212 --> 15:11.588
Ah!

15:11.588 --> 15:13.167
Urgh!

15:13.167 --> 15:15.416
How do you say "surrender"
in Chinese?

15:16.219 --> 15:17.213
Aaaah!

15:18.637 --> 15:21.592
OK. I'm about to slice you up
like a giant California roll!

15:21.592 --> 15:22.963
Raaah!

15:26.396 --> 15:28.970
- Ooh! Ooh! Ooh!
- Ha ha ha. Funny black man.

15:28.970 --> 15:30.439
Ooh... Oh! Shit!

15:32.276 --> 15:33.556
I'm not playin' no more.

15:33.556 --> 15:35.277
Ahh!

15:36.321 --> 15:37.353
Aaah!

15:43.870 --> 15:46.077
- Lee, let go!
- Carter!

15:46.077 --> 15:46.953
Grrrrr!

15:49.293 --> 15:51.500
Down! Put us down!

15:52.839 --> 15:55.081
Let me down! I'm sorry!

15:55.081 --> 15:57.332
- Aaaaah!
- I'm sorry, man!

15:57.332 --> 15:59.300
How the hell did we
get in this mess?

16:00.388 --> 16:01.716
- Ugh!
- Agh!

16:14.944 --> 16:16.273
May I help you?

16:17.322 --> 16:19.315
We'll be asking
the questions, old man.

16:19.315 --> 16:20.439
- Who are you?
- Yu.

16:20.439 --> 16:22.240
- No, not me. You.
- Yes, I am Yu.

16:22.240 --> 16:23.785
Just answer the damn questions.

16:23.785 --> 16:25.494
- Who are you?
- I have told you.

16:25.494 --> 16:27.619
- Are you deaf?
- No, Yu is blind.

16:27.619 --> 16:28.870
I'm not blind, you blind.

16:28.870 --> 16:31.284
- That is what I just said.
- You just said what?

16:31.284 --> 16:34.047
- I did not say what, I said Yu.
- That's what I'm asking you.

16:34.047 --> 16:36.003
- And Yu is answering.
- Shut up!

16:36.003 --> 16:36.956
- You!
- Yes?

16:36.956 --> 16:38.080
Not you, him!

16:38.080 --> 16:39.255
- What's your name?
- Mi.

16:39.255 --> 16:40.838
- Yes, you!
- I am Mi.

16:40.838 --> 16:42.839
He is Mi, and I am Yu.

16:42.839 --> 16:45.885
And I'm about to whup your old ass, man,
'cause I'm sick of playin' games!

16:45.885 --> 16:49.142
You, me, everybody's ass
around here! Him!

16:49.142 --> 16:50.474
- Carter, Carter.
- I'm-a kick his ass.

16:50.474 --> 16:51.974
- I'm sick of this.
- Carter, let me handle this.

16:51.974 --> 16:53.145
- Lee. No, Lee. No!
- Carter!

16:53.145 --> 16:53.926
Go.

16:56.486 --> 17:00.022
My name is Inspector Lee.
We have a key to Soo Yung's locker.

17:02.451 --> 17:04.692
Some men came here this morning.
They had guns.

17:04.692 --> 17:06.944
They emptied her locker.
I could not stop them.

17:06.944 --> 17:08.117
You must go to her at once.

17:08.117 --> 17:09.202
Why?

17:09.202 --> 17:13.124
They said she would end up like her father.

17:14.256 --> 17:16.127
Let's go.

17:16.127 --> 17:17.708
I don't know what the hell
you feedin' him...

17:17.708 --> 17:20.717
- but he is too damn big!
- Carter. Go.

17:41.907 --> 17:42.903
Where is everyone?

17:42.903 --> 17:44.486
Where's all the damn cops?

17:50.625 --> 17:52.036
- Lee.
- Where's security?

17:52.036 --> 17:53.325
They were called away.

17:53.325 --> 17:55.542
W... What's wrong?

17:55.542 --> 17:57.290
Carter.

17:58.425 --> 18:00.298
Aw, this ain't good.

18:00.298 --> 18:02.543
They're coming for him.

18:02.543 --> 18:04.131
What do we do?

18:16.693 --> 18:18.021
No.

18:21.113 --> 18:22.393
No!

18:23.866 --> 18:27.282
Don't move, or I'll
blow your ass cheeks off.

18:27.282 --> 18:28.699
Get back.

18:28.699 --> 18:30.068
Ugh!

18:31.082 --> 18:32.955
Who sent you?

18:33.876 --> 18:34.659
Oh!

18:37.422 --> 18:38.833
Don't move!

18:43.345 --> 18:44.721
Lee, throw me a gun!

18:44.721 --> 18:46.049
- Huh?
- Throw me a gun!

18:48.892 --> 18:50.517
- Damn, Lee!
- Huh?

19:16.836 --> 19:18.628
Lee! I thought you had my back!

19:21.592 --> 19:23.501
Aaaaaah!

19:28.014 --> 19:29.058
Ugh!

19:35.230 --> 19:36.559
Soo Yung, one more!

19:38.942 --> 19:40.353
Hyah!

19:41.570 --> 19:43.313
Aaaaah!

19:44.365 --> 19:46.903
Lee, I'm in trouble!
I need some assistance.

19:48.745 --> 19:50.026
Here.

19:51.496 --> 19:52.659
It's empty.

19:52.659 --> 19:53.910
What?

19:56.543 --> 19:57.824
Hah!

20:02.717 --> 20:04.625
You see? I always got your back.

20:04.625 --> 20:06.260
Why the hell you give me
an empty gun, then?

20:06.260 --> 20:08.254
I didn't know.

20:08.254 --> 20:10.506
You almost got me killed, Lee.

20:12.935 --> 20:14.892
- Ah! Ahh!
- Who are you? Who sent you?

20:19.566 --> 20:20.562
What the hell is that?

20:20.562 --> 20:21.683
I think he's speaking French.

20:21.683 --> 20:23.687
French? What kind of
Chinaman speak French?

20:23.687 --> 20:25.238
Tell him to stop playin' around
and talk right.

20:25.238 --> 20:26.901
How can I tell him?
I don't speak French.

20:27.575 --> 20:28.358
Ah!

20:29.077 --> 20:30.868
Talk right, man.

20:30.868 --> 20:33.409
No! You're Asian.
Stop humiliatin' yourself.

20:35.166 --> 20:37.787
Shut the hell up.
Shut up. Come here.

20:37.787 --> 20:40.120
We're gonna need a few minutes
alone with this guy.

20:40.120 --> 20:42.372
Find someone here
who speaks French, please.

20:44.550 --> 20:45.664
Speak English!

20:47.804 --> 20:50.176
Uh, this is Sister Agnes
from the chapel upstairs.

20:50.176 --> 20:52.970
She speaks fluent French
and has agreed to interpret for you.

20:52.970 --> 20:54.886
Sister, we appreciate you doin' this.

20:54.886 --> 20:55.890
My pleasure.

20:55.890 --> 20:58.433
Sister Agnes,
please ask who sent him.

21:04.863 --> 21:07.235
He says you're both making
a big mistake.

21:07.235 --> 21:09.315
That one day soon
you'll beg for mercy.

21:09.315 --> 21:10.737
He also said...

21:10.737 --> 21:12.404
What?

21:12.404 --> 21:14.951
Please, Sister, we have to know.

21:14.951 --> 21:16.119
There's lives at stake.

21:17.167 --> 21:18.745
Well, he used the N-word.

21:18.745 --> 21:20.875
What? The N-word?

21:20.875 --> 21:23.002
- You tell this little motherf...
- Carter!

21:24.049 --> 21:26.125
She's a nun.

21:26.125 --> 21:31.094
Sister, you tell this piece of S-word
that I will personally F-word him up.

21:41.065 --> 21:42.097
Did he say "Negro"?

21:42.097 --> 21:45.193
He used the N-word again, but this time
he mentioned your grandmother.

21:45.193 --> 21:47.982
You tell him
that his mama's a H!

21:47.982 --> 21:51.192
Carter, I believe "whore" is
spelled with a W.

21:51.192 --> 21:53.526
Right. W. And his sister's a W.

21:53.526 --> 21:55.494
And his grandmama's
a two-big W...

21:55.494 --> 21:57.538
who makes double
'cause she got no teeth!

21:57.538 --> 21:59.368
You tell him I said that.

22:11.722 --> 22:12.636
Did he say it again?

22:12.636 --> 22:14.680
No. This time he called...

22:14.680 --> 22:17.436
this gentleman a word
that means "cat"...

22:17.436 --> 22:20.189
and another word that rhymes
with "maggot."

22:20.189 --> 22:21.304
What?!

22:22.233 --> 22:25.234
Well, you tell him he's an A.W.

22:25.234 --> 22:27.809
Uh, Lee,
"hole" is spelled with a H.

22:27.809 --> 22:29.482
I have a dictionary upstairs.

22:29.482 --> 22:31.067
Just call him an asshole.

22:35.913 --> 22:38.831
He says you've both been marked
for death, like Han and the girl.

22:38.831 --> 22:41.667
Ooh. Sister, turn your back.
You don't want to see this.

22:41.667 --> 22:43.745
Who is Shy Shen
and how do we find him?

22:43.745 --> 22:46.245
Tell us right now or I'll cut your B's off
and shove 'em in your mouth.

22:46.245 --> 22:48.547
- His beads?
- His beads, Sister.

22:48.547 --> 22:50.046
His hairy, stinkin' beads.

22:50.046 --> 22:51.595
Tell me somethin' now.

22:51.595 --> 22:54.086
Lee, give me the gun.
Give me the gun, Lee.

22:56.058 --> 22:58.929
It's over, brother. It's over. OK.

22:58.929 --> 23:00.563
Who is Shy Shen?!

23:00.563 --> 23:01.595
What did he say, Sister?

23:01.595 --> 23:03.101
He said "shoot me."

23:04.943 --> 23:06.650
Lee, there's no bullets in here.

23:06.650 --> 23:10.319
- I'm sorry.
- I am trying to kill somebody, man.

23:10.319 --> 23:13.076
Damn. OK.

23:13.076 --> 23:14.322
You better tell me
something right now.

23:14.322 --> 23:15.490
I'll send you right to heaven, man.

23:15.490 --> 23:16.907
- I don't even care no more.
- Carter.

23:16.907 --> 23:20.115
I'm marked for death.
I ain't got nothin' to lose.

23:20.115 --> 23:23.125
That's right, Sister. Call the Lord and tell
him he 'bout to have some company.

23:23.125 --> 23:25.084
Carter, stop.

23:25.084 --> 23:27.080
Tell me something!

23:27.080 --> 23:29.131
- Carter, enough.
- Oh, she's almost done.

23:29.131 --> 23:31.590
Forgive me, Father,
for I have sinned!

23:31.590 --> 23:33.504
He says wait!

23:36.015 --> 23:38.886
- What did he say?
- 50 Franklin D. Roosevelt.

23:38.886 --> 23:40.091
Geneviève.

23:40.091 --> 23:41.930
Thank you.

23:44.400 --> 23:45.596
Nice workin' with ya, Sister.

23:45.596 --> 23:47.234
Anytime, brother.

23:49.571 --> 23:50.899
50 FDR.

23:50.899 --> 23:52.899
- It's an address.
- It's a wild goose chase.

23:52.899 --> 23:55.448
Every city in America has
a street named after Roosevelt.

23:55.448 --> 23:57.612
- And who is Geneviève?
- I don't know.

23:57.612 --> 24:00.326
Soo Yung, we're getting you
out of here.

24:00.326 --> 24:01.993
- Why?
- It's not safe for you here.

24:01.993 --> 24:03.282
I won't leave him.

24:03.282 --> 24:04.955
We have no choice.

24:30.278 --> 24:32.188
- Soo Yung.
- Mr. Reynard.

24:33.449 --> 24:34.991
I'm glad your father is OK.

24:34.991 --> 24:36.736
My people won't leave his side.

24:36.736 --> 24:38.535
- You have my word.
- Thank you.

24:38.535 --> 24:39.819
So, let's go.

24:39.819 --> 24:42.156
- Ah.
- Wh... Where am I going?

24:42.156 --> 24:45.583
We're getting out of Los Angeles.
It's not safe for us.

24:45.583 --> 24:47.709
Just a few days, Soo Yung.
I promise.

24:47.709 --> 24:50.417
You'll come with me
and my family to Paris.

24:53.677 --> 24:54.460
OK.

24:58.975 --> 25:00.802
Wait.

25:02.938 --> 25:04.311
You made me a promise.

25:06.481 --> 25:07.857
Don't forget.

25:19.077 --> 25:20.323
My God.

25:21.830 --> 25:24.582
We got a assassin in custody
who only speaks French...

25:24.582 --> 25:27.205
a limo blows up
at the French Consulate...

25:27.205 --> 25:31.162
and the next meeting of the World Court
is in Paris, two days from now.

25:31.162 --> 25:32.419
Are you thinking
what I'm thinking?

25:32.419 --> 25:33.504
Yeah.

25:33.504 --> 25:35.301
That we go to Fiji,
we hide out for a year...

25:35.301 --> 25:37.177
maybe change our names,
get jobs as bartenders...

25:37.177 --> 25:38.544
and I'm-a call you Kiko.

25:38.544 --> 25:41.428
We have to find Shy Shen
before he finds us.

25:41.428 --> 25:42.845
We're going to Paris, aren't we?

25:42.845 --> 25:44.679
Yes. Tonight.

25:54.532 --> 25:58.362
Did you know the average French woman
is naked 34 percent of the time?

25:58.362 --> 26:00.159
We are not going there
to meet women.

26:02.580 --> 26:05.286
You have to forget about her,
and let me hook you up.

26:05.286 --> 26:08.246
Hook me up?
After what you did to Isabella?

26:08.246 --> 26:09.913
It was an accident.

26:09.913 --> 26:11.379
Besides, you never even
slept with her.

26:11.379 --> 26:13.920
Thanks to you.
It was going to happen.

26:13.920 --> 26:15.384
But you just had to ruin it.

26:15.384 --> 26:16.666
What did I do that was so terrible?

26:16.666 --> 26:19.253
You shot my girlfriend.
In the neck!

26:19.253 --> 26:20.629
There's nothing else to say.

26:20.629 --> 26:21.802
It's not like she died.

26:21.802 --> 26:24.845
So she has droopy eyes.
So she works at El Poco Loco.

26:24.845 --> 26:26.396
That was temporary.

26:26.396 --> 26:28.936
As soon as she could blink,
the Secret Service took her back.

26:28.936 --> 26:32.025
You know what your problem is?
You need to relax, have some fun.

26:32.025 --> 26:34.731
You have too much rice in your diet.
You're constipated.

26:34.731 --> 26:36.280
I never should have brought you.

26:36.280 --> 26:37.740
Face it, you need me, brother.

26:37.740 --> 26:41.194
I don't need anyone.
And please don't call me brother.

26:41.194 --> 26:42.236
What is this?

26:42.236 --> 26:44.489
Underground gentleman's club
in Paris.

26:44.489 --> 26:46.290
"Club La Passe"? Forget it.

26:46.290 --> 26:48.497
Check out the address.

26:48.497 --> 26:50.910
"50 Franklin D... Roosevelt."

26:50.910 --> 26:53.293
Like I said, you need me.

26:53.293 --> 26:58.008
'Scuse me. Can we have one
gefilte fish and some Ex-Lax?

27:05.728 --> 27:07.138
Where the bags at, man?

27:08.522 --> 27:11.013
Excuse me, gentlemen.

27:11.013 --> 27:14.108
Commissaire Revi of the DST.
Would you please come with me?

27:14.108 --> 27:15.440
Why?

27:15.440 --> 27:18.199
Just need to ask you
a few questions.

27:18.199 --> 27:21.781
Oh! Oh! Man!
Goddamn, man!

27:21.781 --> 27:25.702
Oh! Man, this is by far the worst airport
I ever been to.

27:25.702 --> 27:26.484
Oh!

27:27.416 --> 27:28.911
- Ooph!
- Ah, man!

27:28.911 --> 27:31.327
Now that I have your attention,
why don't you tell me...

27:31.327 --> 27:33.544
what you cops are looking for
here in Paris.

27:33.544 --> 27:35.874
I told you, man. We on vacation.

27:35.874 --> 27:37.378
Just taking in the sights.

27:37.378 --> 27:39.839
Gentlemen, this is my city...

27:39.839 --> 27:42.680
and I'm responsible
if two stupid cops come here...

27:42.680 --> 27:45.338
and get their heads
blown off by the triads.

27:45.338 --> 27:49.563
Now, I can't force you to leave,
but I can make the suggestion.

27:49.563 --> 27:54.309
After all, I found this dirty little gun
inside your jacket.

27:54.309 --> 27:58.316
Which means you could both
do 20 years in my jail.

27:58.316 --> 27:59.900
Do we understand each other?

28:01.159 --> 28:03.068
Do we understand each other?

28:03.068 --> 28:07.324
Excellent. It was wonderful
meeting you both.

28:09.167 --> 28:10.958
So we can go now?

28:10.958 --> 28:12.871
This will just take a moment.

28:12.871 --> 28:14.706
Welcome to Paris.

28:14.706 --> 28:16.208
Oh, shit.

28:26.935 --> 28:28.810
Ohh. Ohhh.

28:28.810 --> 28:31.103
- Ahh.
- Where you go?

28:31.103 --> 28:33.098
- Ugh.
- 50 Franklin, uh...

28:33.098 --> 28:34.187
D. Roosevelt.

28:34.187 --> 28:36.102
No. Get out.

28:36.102 --> 28:37.818
- What?
- I don't drive his kind.

28:37.818 --> 28:39.363
- My kind?
- Americans.

28:39.363 --> 28:40.776
I don't drive Americans.

28:40.776 --> 28:42.823
- But I'm Chinese.
- Yeah, but you're with him...

28:42.823 --> 28:44.618
and they're the most
violent people on earth.

28:44.618 --> 28:46.991
Always starting wars,
always killing people.

28:46.991 --> 28:48.704
Americans make me sick.

28:48.704 --> 28:50.783
Look, man, we are not
in the mood for this.

28:50.783 --> 28:53.545
Me and my partner just got violated
by a small Frenchman.

28:53.545 --> 28:55.124
Wearing a very large ring.

28:55.124 --> 28:58.796
You're a pathetic bunch of criminals
who always resort to violence.

28:58.796 --> 29:00.259
Always push around the little guy.

29:00.259 --> 29:02.087
Hey, that stuff ain't true.
America's not violent!

29:02.087 --> 29:04.053
Come on, America is a joke.

29:04.053 --> 29:06.048
You lost in Vietnam,
you lost in Iraq.

29:06.048 --> 29:08.633
You can't even beat the Europeans
in basketball anymore.

29:08.633 --> 29:10.139
The Dream Team is dead.

29:10.139 --> 29:12.554
Ha ha. I didn't hear you, man.

29:12.554 --> 29:14.973
Talk about the NBA again,
I dare ya. I double-dare ya.

29:14.973 --> 29:17.274
Even your skinny women disgust me.

29:17.274 --> 29:19.188
- Halle Berry.
- Wh...? Aw, hell no.

29:19.188 --> 29:20.443
Now you done gone too far.

29:20.443 --> 29:22.026
You want violence,
smelly Frenchman? Huh?

29:22.026 --> 29:23.825
Do you want violence?
Well, you got it!

29:23.825 --> 29:25.818
- Carter, put the gun down.
- Say you love America.

29:25.818 --> 29:28.236
I love America.
Please, don't kill me.

29:28.236 --> 29:29.610
Sing the national anthem!

29:31.417 --> 29:33.493
Not that one, man!
Sing the American one.

29:33.493 --> 29:34.914
Don't know it.

29:34.914 --> 29:39.417
# Oh, say can you see #

29:39.841 --> 29:43.341
# Oh, say can you see #

29:43.341 --> 29:47.012
# By the dawn's early light #

29:47.012 --> 29:48.974
# Ah-doo da-doo-dee light... #

30:20.341 --> 30:22.215
Wait for us here, George.

30:36.400 --> 30:38.392
Ooh la la. Lee.

30:38.392 --> 30:40.027
Carter, stay focused.

30:40.027 --> 30:41.772
We're looking for Geneviève.

30:41.772 --> 30:45.148
Let's split up.
I'll take the women.

31:09.390 --> 31:12.178
Carter. James Carter.

31:17.232 --> 31:19.806
I know you probably don't understand
a word I'm saying...

31:19.806 --> 31:21.145
but I gotta tell you...

31:21.145 --> 31:23.561
you're the most beautiful woman
I ever seen in my life.

31:23.561 --> 31:25.862
And I'd like to strip you down
and butter you...

31:25.862 --> 31:27.823
like a slice of Wonder Bread.

31:27.823 --> 31:31.610
And shave your armpits and pour honey
all over your naked body.

31:31.610 --> 31:34.789
And for the next two weeks
pretend I was a hungry bear.

31:34.789 --> 31:39.253
Well, James Carter,
I happen to speak six languages.

31:39.253 --> 31:40.998
One of 'em English?

31:42.591 --> 31:44.667
Are you in or out?

31:48.514 --> 31:50.008
Money plays.

31:50.008 --> 31:52.009
Sir, it's a thousand-euro minimum.

31:52.009 --> 31:53.476
How much I'm short?

31:53.476 --> 31:55.470
930 euros.

31:55.470 --> 31:57.686
- Heh.
- It's OK.

31:57.686 --> 31:59.482
Let him play.

31:59.482 --> 32:00.597
Thank you.

32:00.597 --> 32:01.937
Changez.

32:01.937 --> 32:02.940
- Changez.
- Changez.

32:02.940 --> 32:03.977
Changez?

32:19.086 --> 32:20.878
I'm looking for Geneviève.

32:28.721 --> 32:30.299
Maybe I can help you.

32:34.769 --> 32:36.264
Do you know what
I hate about cops?

32:38.440 --> 32:40.099
Even when they're
with a woman...

32:40.099 --> 32:43.525
they can't stop thinking
about getting their man.

32:43.525 --> 32:46.317
Who is Shy Shen?

32:46.317 --> 32:47.687
See what I mean?

32:49.784 --> 32:53.484
Come upstairs, cop.
I'll give you what you want.

32:58.459 --> 33:01.247
- Hit me.
- Monsieur, this is baccarat.

33:01.247 --> 33:02.536
I know that!

33:02.536 --> 33:04.873
You think I don't know
baccarack when I play it?

33:04.873 --> 33:06.709
When I was a kid,
me and my friends and I...

33:06.709 --> 33:08.461
used to hang out in front of
the Magic Johnson Theater...

33:08.461 --> 33:10.675
and play baccarack all night long.

33:10.675 --> 33:12.721
Now hit me.

33:18.771 --> 33:20.930
Three kings.
Read 'em and weep.

33:24.987 --> 33:26.315
Three kings is a zero.

33:26.315 --> 33:28.896
You have the worst possible hand.
You lose.

33:28.896 --> 33:30.450
What?

33:33.203 --> 33:34.745
Ah, madame has a 7.

33:34.745 --> 33:37.202
She wins 100,000 euros. Bravo.

33:37.202 --> 33:39.912
Mr. Carter, it appears you have
brought me luck.

33:39.912 --> 33:42.327
I'd like to bring you
breakfast in bed.

33:46.424 --> 33:47.918
Excuse me.

33:56.727 --> 33:58.137
Way to go, Lee.

33:58.137 --> 34:00.351
Today, my boy becomes a man.

34:02.233 --> 34:03.940
Why are you helping me?

34:03.940 --> 34:06.351
Maybe I'm helping myself.

34:06.351 --> 34:08.319
How do I find Geneviève?

34:08.319 --> 34:10.730
I see you like to get right to it.

34:10.730 --> 34:12.402
Do you know Shy Shen?

34:14.328 --> 34:16.237
Would you like to know
a secret, cop?

34:16.237 --> 34:17.576
Yes, please.

34:18.873 --> 34:21.710
Someone's gonna die here tonight.

34:27.257 --> 34:28.539
And it's you.

34:28.539 --> 34:29.915
- Huh! Huh!
- Ugh!

34:29.915 --> 34:32.051
- Huh!
- Ahh!

34:34.766 --> 34:36.391
Unh!

34:36.391 --> 34:37.885
- Unh!
- Ah!

34:39.143 --> 34:41.221
- Uh!
- Urgh! Ah!

34:41.221 --> 34:44.563
Ohh! Ah! Oh!

34:44.563 --> 34:47.022
Ugh! Grrrrr!

34:48.279 --> 34:50.318
Ohhh!

34:50.318 --> 34:51.947
Ohhh!

34:51.947 --> 34:54.239
Ah! Ahhh!

34:54.239 --> 34:56.485
- Nngh! Guh!
- Oh! Ah!

34:56.485 --> 34:57.658
- Gnnh!
- Ahhh!

35:09.301 --> 35:11.507
Come on, crouching tiger,
don't hide that dragon.

35:11.507 --> 35:13.137
- Uh!
- Aaah!

35:25.735 --> 35:28.308
Do it, Lee.
You tear that ass up.

35:28.308 --> 35:30.312
- Ahh!
- Oh, oh!

35:41.250 --> 35:42.791
You are a super freak!

35:42.791 --> 35:44.204
Carter!

35:44.204 --> 35:45.408
Oh!

35:45.408 --> 35:46.832
- Run!
- Oh!

35:53.512 --> 35:54.709
- Ahh!
- Sorry.

35:54.709 --> 35:56.596
- You got a boyfriend?
- Carter!

35:58.934 --> 36:00.344
Start the car.

36:00.344 --> 36:02.891
- Start the car!
- Drive fast!

36:24.250 --> 36:26.658
Carter. Look!

36:26.658 --> 36:29.458
Uh, George?
We need you to go faster, man.

36:29.458 --> 36:30.663
No. Forget it.

36:30.663 --> 36:34.007
You wanna kill me,
then go ahead, kill me.

36:34.007 --> 36:36.134
- Ahh!
- Drive faster!

36:38.766 --> 36:40.474
Please! I'm scared!

36:40.474 --> 36:42.137
George, you watch
American movies?

36:42.137 --> 36:43.259
- Yeah.
- OK, man. All right.

36:43.259 --> 36:45.394
Listen, you're a super-spy.

36:45.394 --> 36:48.019
A super-spy.

36:48.019 --> 36:50.813
Now drive this cab.

36:50.813 --> 36:52.527
- Come on.
- OK.

36:53.781 --> 36:55.240
I'm a super-spy.

37:07.045 --> 37:08.919
Oh, shit, George. Go!

37:13.425 --> 37:14.374
- Aah!
- George...

37:14.374 --> 37:16.176
When I tell you to,
hit the brakes.

37:20.391 --> 37:21.304
Now!

37:26.897 --> 37:28.096
Oh, they got guns, Lee!

37:28.096 --> 37:29.934
- Ungh!
- Ah!

37:32.362 --> 37:34.153
- Ungh!
- Back up!

37:44.666 --> 37:45.911
Argh!

37:47.043 --> 37:49.167
Way to go, George.

37:51.758 --> 37:52.586
It's OK.

37:56.553 --> 37:57.751
Uh!

37:57.751 --> 37:58.795
Aah!

37:59.848 --> 38:00.797
Hey!

38:09.607 --> 38:11.149
I got this one.

38:12.528 --> 38:13.772
Aah!

38:13.772 --> 38:16.020
Oh! Whoa! He's got my leg!

38:16.782 --> 38:18.738
Aaaah!

38:18.738 --> 38:20.368
Lee! God!

38:20.368 --> 38:25.079
- Aaaaah!
- Hold m...

38:25.079 --> 38:26.244
Ah!

38:32.130 --> 38:33.293
Get your own damn cab.

38:41.141 --> 38:42.516
Ow!

38:42.516 --> 38:43.976
Lee!

38:43.976 --> 38:45.684
- Urgh!
- Yah!

38:47.104 --> 38:48.433
Yeah! Whoa!

38:48.433 --> 38:49.803
- Ungh!
- Oh!

38:49.803 --> 38:52.686
The French are neutral!
This is not my fight!

38:52.686 --> 38:53.726
This is not...!

38:56.531 --> 39:00.610
Ah! Lee, I'm alive.

39:00.610 --> 39:02.610
My whole life flashed in front of me.

39:02.610 --> 39:04.411
In three years I'll be married
to a Chinese woman.

39:04.411 --> 39:07.249
We had three kids looked just like you,
only a little darker.

39:07.249 --> 39:08.246
- Carter.
- What?

39:08.246 --> 39:10.076
Put your hands up.

39:10.076 --> 39:12.042
What you talkin' 'bout?

39:12.042 --> 39:13.872
Whoa!

39:30.940 --> 39:33.858
Some people say the modern world
was invented...

39:33.858 --> 39:36.647
when the French built
these sewers.

39:36.647 --> 39:39.988
10 million gallons pumped
through every hour.

39:39.988 --> 39:43.278
A marvel that no one ever sees.

39:43.278 --> 39:45.493
Welcome to Paris, Lee.

39:45.493 --> 39:46.909
Lee, you know this clown?

39:46.909 --> 39:50.829
Go on, Lee. Tell him who I am.
Don't be shy.

39:50.829 --> 39:52.875
Introduce him
to your shyong dih.

39:52.875 --> 39:55.667
Shyong dih? Your brother?

39:55.667 --> 39:57.334
He doesn't talk about me much.

39:57.334 --> 40:00.461
In fact, he's spent his whole life
trying to forget me.

40:00.461 --> 40:03.091
How would it look if Hong Kong's
great Inspector Lee...

40:03.091 --> 40:05.754
had a brother on the wrong side
of the law?

40:05.754 --> 40:08.341
You're not my brother anymore.

40:08.341 --> 40:10.013
Are you forgetting about Chenzhou?

40:10.605 --> 40:11.886
Yes, I forgot.

40:11.886 --> 40:14.936
You spared my life in Los Angeles.

40:14.936 --> 40:18.894
You should have shot me in that alley.
But you didn't pull the trigger

40:18.894 --> 40:21.527
because you can't escape your past.

40:21.867 --> 40:24.440
I didn't kill you
because I'm not an assassin.

40:24.787 --> 40:27.788
Let me repay the favour, Lee.

40:27.788 --> 40:31.621
I'll allow you to live
if you promise to leave Paris tonight.

40:31.621 --> 40:34.415
You got a deal. Thank you
for showin' us the sewer.

40:34.415 --> 40:37.126
Listen, that's a badass suit.
Let's get the hell outta here.

40:37.126 --> 40:39.707
What about Han and his daughter?

40:39.707 --> 40:41.543
There is nothing I can do for them.

40:42.720 --> 40:45.425
- I have no choice.
- Then I have no choice.

40:45.425 --> 40:48.600
Well, I guess he's stayin'.
Who wanna take me to the airport?

40:50.729 --> 40:52.805
We'll always be brothers, Lee.

40:52.805 --> 40:55.388
In this life and the next.

40:59.571 --> 41:01.445
Tell me, Kenji, who's Shy Shen?

41:02.783 --> 41:05.987
Some secrets are worth dying for.

41:06.829 --> 41:09.236
Oh. OK. A... All right. OK.

41:10.582 --> 41:12.824
Lee, what the hell is goin' on?

41:18.758 --> 41:20.134
Go!

41:20.134 --> 41:22.009
Hey, which way, man?

41:32.439 --> 41:34.346
- Shit, Lee, it's locked!
- Over here!

41:34.346 --> 41:36.063
- Lee!
- We have to jump!

41:37.150 --> 41:39.642
- Ooph.
- Oh, that's the sewer!

41:39.642 --> 41:41.729
- Hell no, Lee!
- No choice!

41:41.729 --> 41:42.985
- I'd rather die.
- Come on!

41:44.283 --> 41:45.065
Oh!

41:45.994 --> 41:50.620
Shi-i-i-i-i-it!

41:54.752 --> 41:56.413
I'm gonna kill you, Lee!

42:05.137 --> 42:07.426
Bonjour. Welcome to
the Plaza Athénée.

42:07.426 --> 42:08.547
How may I help you?

42:08.547 --> 42:11.727
It's great to see you again.
It's been too long.

42:11.727 --> 42:13.222
Yes, far too long, sir.

42:13.222 --> 42:16.230
Listen, I need a big suite,
two beds, two showers...

42:16.230 --> 42:19.816
a massage therapist, some new clothes
and a case of Old Spice.

42:23.031 --> 42:26.233
It's all your fault.
How come you didn't tell me about Kenji?

42:26.233 --> 42:28.567
It was none of your business.

42:28.567 --> 42:32.493
In case you missed it, man,
people are tryin' to kill me.

42:32.493 --> 42:35.370
I'm covered in shit and some French cops
whupped my ass...

42:35.370 --> 42:36.740
with some Yellow Pages, man.

42:36.740 --> 42:38.379
So don't tell me it ain't
none of my business.

42:38.379 --> 42:39.873
You're lucky we're not
in Hong Kong.

42:39.873 --> 42:41.458
Phone book is twice as big.

42:41.458 --> 42:43.708
Why you didn't tell me
you had a brother, man?

42:46.972 --> 42:48.764
Oh, hell, no...

42:49.683 --> 42:50.632
- Lady.
- Oui?

42:50.632 --> 42:53.263
This damn dog just pissed on me.

42:53.263 --> 42:54.977
Good girl.

42:57.774 --> 43:00.396
You know what I think?

43:00.396 --> 43:03.523
I think you feel sorry for this guy.

43:03.523 --> 43:05.570
Maybe Kenji didn't get away in LA.

43:07.492 --> 43:09.616
Maybe you let him go.

43:09.616 --> 43:14.117
The yakuza killed his family in Tokyo.
He was sent to China when he was 7.

43:14.117 --> 43:18.667
He was put in Chenzhou,
the orphanage where I grew up.

43:18.667 --> 43:20.829
We kept each other alive.

43:20.829 --> 43:24.208
You protected each other.
And you're still protectin' him.

43:25.844 --> 43:27.672
I call him shyong dih.

43:27.672 --> 43:30.171
He was like my brother.

43:30.171 --> 43:32.305
And then I left him.

43:32.305 --> 43:34.301
You was adopted.
What choice did you have?

43:34.301 --> 43:36.470
He ended up on the streets.

43:38.065 --> 43:39.607
You could never understand.

43:39.607 --> 43:41.234
I understand, man.
I got a brother.

43:41.234 --> 43:42.268
My little brother Perry.

43:42.268 --> 43:44.519
We used to be best friends.
Now we don't even speak.

43:44.519 --> 43:47.318
He think I tipped off the cops
about his chicken fights in his garage.

43:47.318 --> 43:49.863
Can you believe that?
My own brother think I'm a snitch.

43:49.863 --> 43:51.695
Just 'cause my chicken lost
in the semifinals.

43:51.695 --> 43:52.701
I didn't even really care.

43:52.701 --> 43:53.952
- Carter.
- Fight was fixed, man.

43:53.952 --> 43:55.950
My bird was fightin' a chicken
that didn't make his weight.

43:55.950 --> 43:57.072
And he still went the distance.

43:57.072 --> 43:59.540
He had a lotta heart.
And he was delicious.

43:59.540 --> 44:02.998
It's best if I do this on my own.
This fight is personal.

44:02.998 --> 44:04.633
Lemme help you, man.
I'm-a tell you right now...

44:04.633 --> 44:06.177
whatever Kenji's
tellin' you, it ain't true.

44:06.177 --> 44:08.966
- He ain't your brother.
- And you are not my brother.

44:10.180 --> 44:11.591
Huh.

44:13.851 --> 44:15.890
Fine.

44:15.890 --> 44:18.184
I'm not your brother.

44:28.908 --> 44:32.954
# What have I got to do
to make you love me? #

44:35.249 --> 44:40.040
# Sorry seems to be
the hardest word #

44:43.424 --> 44:45.048
- # It's sad #
- # So sad #

44:45.048 --> 44:46.841
# So sad #

44:46.841 --> 44:50.711
# It's a sad, sad situation #

44:50.711 --> 44:55.218
# And it's getting more and more absurd #

44:56.479 --> 44:58.436
Wow. Holy smokes!

44:58.436 --> 45:00.016
- # It's sad #
- Crash landing!

45:00.016 --> 45:03.060
- # So sad #
- Short Round... step on it!

45:03.060 --> 45:06.021
Okey-dokey, Dr. Jones.
Hold on to your potatoes.

45:06.021 --> 45:08.782
# Always seems to me #

45:08.782 --> 45:09.979
# That sorry... #

45:09.979 --> 45:13.990
Yes, I would like to order
some fried chicken, please.

45:13.990 --> 45:16.404
Oh, and some sweet-potato pie.

45:17.498 --> 45:18.412
Merci.

45:18.412 --> 45:20.907
Enjoy your mu shu, sir.

45:20.907 --> 45:22.959
- Merci.
- Goodbye.

45:24.882 --> 45:26.542
# East Coast girl are 'ip #

45:26.542 --> 45:31.176
# I really dig those styles
they wear #

45:31.176 --> 45:34.763
# And southern girls
with the way they talk #

45:34.763 --> 45:38.682
# They knock me out
when I'm down there #

45:38.682 --> 45:41.890
# The Midwest
farmers' daughters #

45:41.890 --> 45:45.601
# Really make you feel all right #

45:45.601 --> 45:49.229
# And the northerns girls
with the way they kiss #

45:49.229 --> 45:53.369
# They keep their boyfriend
warm at night #

45:53.369 --> 45:57.116
# I wish they all could
be California #

45:57.116 --> 46:00.657
# I wish they all could be California #

46:00.657 --> 46:04.251
# I wish they all
could be California... #

46:04.251 --> 46:06.331
Hm. "Geneviève."

46:14.223 --> 46:15.682
Phew.

46:19.354 --> 46:22.354
- Oh.
- Hello, Inspector.

46:22.354 --> 46:23.768
Minister Reynard.

46:23.768 --> 46:26.693
They want to kill me.
Me and my family.

46:26.693 --> 46:28.770
A dozen agents
from the French secret police...

46:28.770 --> 46:31.865
have already been murdered...
only this last month.

46:31.865 --> 46:34.487
We are at war with the triads,
right here in my own city.

46:34.487 --> 46:36.154
Who is Shy Shen?

46:36.154 --> 46:39.531
Ah, Shy Shen... uh...
Shy Shen is not a person.

46:39.531 --> 46:41.083
It's a list.

46:41.083 --> 46:43.327
- A list?
- Yes.

46:43.327 --> 46:46.335
Every 5 years, the triad bosses
come together...

46:46.335 --> 46:49.838
for an election, and during that ceremony
they choose the men...

46:49.838 --> 46:52.214
who will lead the triads.

46:52.214 --> 46:54.509
- Dragon heads.
- Yes.

46:54.509 --> 46:56.803
13 dragon heads who will control...

46:56.803 --> 46:59.560
the largest criminal organization
in the world.

46:59.560 --> 47:04.305
And their 13 names are inscribed
on the list known as Shy Shen.

47:04.305 --> 47:07.269
A list which has been handed
down and kept secret...

47:07.269 --> 47:10.112
from generation to generation.

47:10.112 --> 47:12.865
If the names on that list
were ever to get out...

47:12.865 --> 47:16.116
well, the secret society
wouldn't be so secret anymore...

47:16.116 --> 47:19.120
and they would all end up in jail,
or dead.

47:19.120 --> 47:20.949
And the list is somewhere in Paris?

47:20.949 --> 47:25.501
A young lady named Geneviève
made contact with Ambassador Han...

47:25.501 --> 47:27.545
and we believe she knows where it is.

47:30.425 --> 47:33.095
I'm asking for your help, Inspector.

47:33.095 --> 47:36.298
Finish what Ambassador Han started.

47:36.298 --> 47:41.383
Get to the girl before the triads do
and you'll get Shy Shen.

48:07.254 --> 48:08.535
Ha ha ha!

48:19.016 --> 48:20.724
Ca va, oui, oui, voulez-vous.

48:20.724 --> 48:23.265
I don't understand.
Who are you?

48:23.265 --> 48:25.346
- Who am I?
- Oui.

48:25.346 --> 48:29.189
I'm Bubbles.
The new costume designer!

48:29.189 --> 48:31.315
Has anyone seen Geneviève?

48:31.315 --> 48:33.146
Uh, she has her own
dressing room.

48:33.146 --> 48:33.928
Ah.

48:35.949 --> 48:37.574
Wait. Bubbles.

48:38.911 --> 48:40.454
Uh, do we look OK?

48:51.298 --> 48:52.497
No. No, no.

48:52.497 --> 48:54.169
These costumes are terrible!

48:54.169 --> 48:57.047
Ladies, please, we have work to do!

49:36.719 --> 49:40.302
First, I will dress the blondes.

49:46.563 --> 49:48.887
And then...

49:48.887 --> 49:51.188
the brunettes.

49:54.195 --> 49:56.484
And finally...

49:56.484 --> 49:58.151
the hybrids.

50:02.996 --> 50:07.457
The Lord have truly bless you all
with tremendous talent...

50:07.457 --> 50:09.251
trust me.

50:10.880 --> 50:15.505
And some of you have
what I like to call...

50:15.505 --> 50:18.961
silver-dollar potential.

50:25.560 --> 50:27.766
# Vous avez lu I'histoire de Jesse James? #

50:30.315 --> 50:33.351
# Comment il vécut,
comment il est mort? #

50:35.154 --> 50:38.357
# Ca vous a plu, hein?
Vous en demandez encore #

50:39.826 --> 50:41.319
# Et bien... #

50:41.319 --> 50:43.532
Lee! What you doin' here?

50:43.532 --> 50:44.534
What are you doing here?

50:44.534 --> 50:46.329
- I found Geneviève.
- So did I.

50:46.329 --> 50:48.040
- They're gonna kill her.
- What?

50:48.040 --> 50:49.953
- Look.
- # Comment il vécut #

50:49.953 --> 50:53.496
# Comment il est mort #

50:53.496 --> 50:54.751
# Ca vous a plu, hein? #

50:54.751 --> 50:58.126
- Lee, you get the lights, I'll get the girl.
- Oh.

50:58.126 --> 51:01.552
# Et bien, écoutez I'histoire #

51:01.552 --> 51:03.846
# De Bonnie and Clyde #

51:08.437 --> 51:11.723
# Alors, voilà,
Clyde a une petite amie #

51:13.275 --> 51:15.601
# Elle est belle et son prénom c'est... #

51:15.601 --> 51:18.364
# Bonnie #

51:18.364 --> 51:23.073
# À eux deux
ils forment le gang Barrow #

51:23.073 --> 51:24.868
- # Leurs noms... #
- # Bonnie Parker #

51:24.868 --> 51:26.698
# Et Clyde Barrow #

51:26.698 --> 51:29.993
# Bonnie and Clyde #

51:31.670 --> 51:35.204
# Bonnie and Clyde #

51:37.717 --> 51:41.252
# Moi, lorsque j'ai connu
Clyde autrefois #

51:42.723 --> 51:46.304
# C'était un gars loyal,
honnête et droit #

51:47.644 --> 51:50.977
# II faut croire
que c'est la société #

51:52.482 --> 51:55.852
# Qui m'a définitivement abîmé #

51:55.852 --> 51:58.813
# Bonnie and Clyde #

52:00.907 --> 52:04.655
# Bonnie and Clyde #

52:07.080 --> 52:09.038
# Qu'est-ce qu'on n'a pas écrit... #

52:09.038 --> 52:11.497
- Your life is in danger.
- What the hell's going on?

52:11.497 --> 52:15.416
You step into that spotlight,
it's the last step you ever gonna take.

52:15.416 --> 52:18.126
They're gonna kill you right now.

52:18.126 --> 52:21.668
- Who are you?
- # On est bien obligé #

52:21.668 --> 52:23.304
# De faire taire celui qui... #

52:23.304 --> 52:25.131
James Carter, LAPD.

52:25.131 --> 52:27.761
# Bonnie and Clyde #

52:27.761 --> 52:30.139
Sorry, James.
It's time for my solo.

52:30.139 --> 52:33.229
# Bonnie and Clyde #

52:37.902 --> 52:40.110
You gotta come with me now, girl.

52:52.584 --> 52:55.371
# The closer I get to you #

53:00.426 --> 53:05.965
# The more you make me see #

53:08.309 --> 53:14.513
# By giving me all you've got #

53:16.192 --> 53:22.645
# Your love has captured
meee-ee-ee #

53:24.200 --> 53:27.284
# Over and over again #

53:27.284 --> 53:31.414
# I tried to tell myself that we #

53:31.414 --> 53:35.331
# Could never be
more than friends #

53:35.331 --> 53:36.499
# And all the while #

53:36.499 --> 53:40.716
# Inside I knew it was real #

53:40.716 --> 53:46.920
# The way you make me feel #

53:46.920 --> 53:50.762
# Sweeter and sweeter
love grows #

53:50.762 --> 53:53.936
# And heaven's there for those #

53:53.936 --> 53:55.814
- What's happening?
- # Who fooled... #

54:00.111 --> 54:01.190
Get your hands off me!

54:01.190 --> 54:02.857
We are friends of Ambassador Han.

54:02.857 --> 54:04.441
Trust us, girl.

54:23.677 --> 54:24.921
Taxi.

54:24.921 --> 54:26.755
Taxi!

54:26.755 --> 54:28.175
- Get in.
- It's George!

54:28.175 --> 54:29.676
Go, go, go.

54:32.936 --> 54:35.473
I've been looking for you
all day, my friend.

54:35.473 --> 54:36.559
We need to talk.

54:36.559 --> 54:38.723
Forget it, George.
We're not paying for any damages.

54:38.723 --> 54:40.773
Oh, no, no, no.
I don't want you to pay.

54:40.773 --> 54:43.980
I wanna ask if I could
drive you full time no charge.

54:43.980 --> 54:45.021
Why you want to drive us?

54:45.021 --> 54:48.483
Today was amazing.
The guns, the shooting.

54:48.483 --> 54:50.865
Now I understand
what it is to be an American.

54:50.865 --> 54:53.623
Please, I'm begging you.
Let me be your driver.

54:53.623 --> 54:56.376
Let me kill someone tonight!

54:56.376 --> 54:58.453
You'll never be an American, OK?

54:58.453 --> 55:00.669
I'll drink this shit all day if I have to.

55:00.669 --> 55:02.036
Just give me a chance.

55:02.036 --> 55:04.041
All right, fine.
Get us to the Plaza, fast.

55:04.041 --> 55:06.211
You got it, boss.

55:06.211 --> 55:07.252
Hold on.

55:16.897 --> 55:19.435
So you think she stole this
Shy Shen list from the triads?

55:19.435 --> 55:21.352
Only one way to find out.

55:21.352 --> 55:22.819
You thinking what I'm thinking?

55:22.819 --> 55:25.276
We need her to talk.
Get her relaxed.

55:25.276 --> 55:27.486
Maybe open up some wine
from the minibar.

55:27.486 --> 55:29.068
Wow.

55:32.954 --> 55:34.330
Maybe we should put on
a dirty movie.

55:34.330 --> 55:36.407
- Lee!
- Only 9.95.

55:36.407 --> 55:38.160
This our chance to find Shy Shen.

55:39.295 --> 55:40.836
I'm goin' in.

55:40.836 --> 55:42.202
What's wrong with you?

55:42.202 --> 55:43.626
Wait, let me go with you.

55:46.427 --> 55:48.716
Some things a man has to do
on his own.

55:54.810 --> 55:56.269
You OK?

55:56.269 --> 55:58.429
Kenji must have figured out
what I've done.

55:58.429 --> 56:00.516
I'm as good as dead.

56:01.526 --> 56:04.527
You stole the list, didn't you?
You tried to sell it to Han?

56:05.948 --> 56:09.647
You don't get it.
I'm one of them.

56:09.647 --> 56:12.412
And if I'm dead, you're dead.

56:19.542 --> 56:24.882
Hey, we're safe.
No one knows we're here.

56:24.882 --> 56:26.211
Just relax.

56:26.211 --> 56:29.669
No one is safe.

56:29.669 --> 56:31.138
I'm marked.

56:31.138 --> 56:32.384
Trust me.

56:32.384 --> 56:33.932
Now why should I trust you?

56:33.932 --> 56:35.808
As the Chinese say...

56:38.771 --> 56:39.970
What does that mean?

56:39.970 --> 56:42.816
"A donkey's lips will not fit
on a horse's mouth."

56:44.904 --> 56:46.527
I'm not sure how that applies.

56:47.989 --> 56:52.153
Well, I was just thinking
you had nice lips.

56:53.370 --> 56:55.777
That's all.

56:56.623 --> 56:59.707
You saved my life today.
Thank you, Carter.

56:59.707 --> 57:02.462
Oh, please. Call me James.

57:02.462 --> 57:03.826
Or Stallion.

57:03.826 --> 57:07.256
No one's saved me
in a long time.

57:07.256 --> 57:08.719
How can I repay you?

57:08.719 --> 57:10.345
You got 20 bucks?

57:13.056 --> 57:14.550
How 'bout ten?

57:15.809 --> 57:17.718
Oh, man. Mmm.

57:17.718 --> 57:18.890
- James.
- What?

57:18.890 --> 57:20.307
- I'm bad.
- I'm bad too.

57:20.307 --> 57:21.477
I'm a bad girl.

57:21.477 --> 57:23.439
Hallelujah!

57:31.659 --> 57:33.568
Oh, yeah.
That's it, baby. Yeah. Uh-oh.

57:33.568 --> 57:35.285
Ha ha. Oh, yeah. That's it, baby.

57:35.285 --> 57:37.742
Oh, yeah. Bite that ear.
Punish that ear.

57:37.742 --> 57:39.160
Do what you wanna do.

57:39.160 --> 57:41.123
Oh, baby... Whoa, whoa,
whoa, wait a minute.

57:41.123 --> 57:42.620
My nipples are sensitive.
Be careful down there.

57:42.620 --> 57:44.835
I've never been with
an American man before.

57:44.835 --> 57:46.001
Neither have I.

57:46.001 --> 57:48.581
I feel so safe with you.
Do you want me?

57:48.581 --> 57:51.961
Ha. How you say "Twice now
and once in the shower" in French?

57:51.961 --> 57:54.426
Wait here. I'm going
to the bathroom.

57:54.426 --> 57:56.424
Make myself more comfortable.

57:58.061 --> 57:59.436
You need some matches?

57:59.436 --> 58:02.273
Don't move.
I'll be right back.

58:05.275 --> 58:06.389
Hello, room service?

58:06.389 --> 58:08.561
Send me up a bottle of honey
and some Red Bull.

58:38.351 --> 58:39.811
Do you like it?

58:39.811 --> 58:42.895
No wonder Lance Armstrong
came all the way here to ride a bike.

58:44.107 --> 58:45.601
Merci beaucoup.

58:49.655 --> 58:50.935
Oui, baby, oui!

58:53.367 --> 58:55.277
Oh, yeah.

58:55.277 --> 58:59.697
Voulez... vous
coucher avec moi, baby?

59:00.749 --> 59:02.290
Je t'aime.

59:02.290 --> 59:03.655
Voulez-vous.

59:03.655 --> 59:05.032
Oh, yeah.

59:05.032 --> 59:07.833
Je t'aime, baby, je t'aime!

59:10.717 --> 59:12.259
Freeze! Don't move!

59:13.303 --> 59:15.177
Ah! Shit! Damn!

59:23.146 --> 59:24.640
- I'm shot.
- It's OK, it's OK.

59:24.640 --> 59:25.976
It's just a flesh wound.
It's OK. Gen...

59:25.976 --> 59:27.180
Geneviève, Geneviève,
let me help you.

59:27.180 --> 59:28.189
- Let me help you, baby.
- I'm terribly sorry.

59:28.189 --> 59:29.439
- I'm OK.
- Where you going?

59:29.439 --> 59:31.320
Je... Damn.

59:31.320 --> 59:33.694
So we even now, huh?
Is that it?

59:33.694 --> 59:35.406
I shoot your girl,
you shoot my girl?

59:35.406 --> 59:37.070
I was trying to save your life.

59:37.070 --> 59:38.275
Well, you couldn't wait five minutes?

59:38.275 --> 59:40.244
We... We was about to
make love, man!

59:40.244 --> 59:41.244
And you ruin it.

59:41.244 --> 59:44.499
They will be coming for us.
We have to get out of here now.

59:44.499 --> 59:46.625
You hear that?
We have to get out of here now.

59:46.625 --> 59:48.620
- Damn, Lee! Damn you.
- Sorry.

59:48.620 --> 59:50.539
Next time I'm getting
my own damn room.

59:53.802 --> 59:55.131
Get them out, George.

59:55.131 --> 59:57.890
These people are danger,
they're bleeding.

59:57.890 --> 59:59.516
How can you bring them
to our home?

59:59.516 --> 01:00:02.269
Paulette, there is something
you should know.

01:00:02.269 --> 01:00:03.976
I'm not what you think I am.

01:00:05.648 --> 01:00:07.023
Are you telling me you're gay?

01:00:11.862 --> 01:00:15.646
I'm trying tell you... l'm an American spy.

01:00:15.646 --> 01:00:17.235
Ha. You a spy?

01:00:17.235 --> 01:00:19.318
Yes, I'm working undercover
with the police.

01:00:19.318 --> 01:00:20.574
We're about to crack a big case!

01:00:20.574 --> 01:00:23.368
Shut your mouth, George.
Not another word.

01:00:23.368 --> 01:00:26.709
You're a stupid cab driver,
like your father was a stupid cab driver.

01:00:26.709 --> 01:00:28.169
What kind of case could you crack?

01:00:28.169 --> 01:00:29.582
Can't talk about it.

01:00:31.758 --> 01:00:35.838
From this moment on, don't ever ask me
about my business!

01:00:37.056 --> 01:00:39.013
Come with me, schmuck. Now.

01:00:45.604 --> 01:00:47.063
We need to get out of the city.

01:00:47.063 --> 01:00:50.351
We're not going anywhere till you tell us
exactly what's going on.

01:00:50.351 --> 01:00:51.937
Did you steal that list
from the triads?

01:00:51.937 --> 01:00:55.148
Geneviève, we cannot help you
until you tell us the truth.

01:00:55.148 --> 01:00:57.196
Where is Shy Shen?

01:00:59.202 --> 01:01:01.159
It's right here.

01:01:02.080 --> 01:01:04.536
Holy mother of Jesus!
She's a man.

01:01:04.536 --> 01:01:07.197
I went to second base
with a damn Frenchman.

01:01:07.197 --> 01:01:08.621
It's The Crying Games.

01:01:08.621 --> 01:01:10.585
I'm Brokeback Carter. Oh, God.

01:01:10.585 --> 01:01:12.380
I'm not a man. It's just a wig.

01:01:12.380 --> 01:01:14.624
You sure about that? Huh?

01:01:14.624 --> 01:01:16.378
Lee, go over there
and check the hardware.

01:01:16.378 --> 01:01:18.712
If she got anything in her bag
bigger than a three-iron...

01:01:18.712 --> 01:01:20.050
we gonna beat his ass!

01:01:20.050 --> 01:01:22.713
I'm a woman, James.
A woman who needs a way out.

01:01:22.713 --> 01:01:24.008
You have to help me.

01:01:24.008 --> 01:01:26.060
- You have Shy Shen?
- No.

01:01:26.060 --> 01:01:28.020
I am Shy Shen.

01:01:35.822 --> 01:01:39.606
In ancient times, when the triads
would select new leaders...

01:01:39.606 --> 01:01:42.488
they would secretly tattoo
the names onto a woman...

01:01:43.830 --> 01:01:46.665
a woman who could carry
the list of Shy Shen...

01:01:46.665 --> 01:01:49.371
to the 35 provinces of China.

01:01:49.371 --> 01:01:52.912
When her journey ended
and the new leaders were informed...

01:01:52.912 --> 01:01:56.173
the woman would be beheaded
and buried forever.

01:01:56.173 --> 01:01:58.631
No records, no witnesses.

01:01:58.631 --> 01:02:00.428
What type of tradition is that?

01:02:00.428 --> 01:02:02.637
Have these guys ever heard of
a damn fax machine?

01:02:02.637 --> 01:02:05.560
Kenji made me do it,
said it was a great honour.

01:02:05.560 --> 01:02:08.598
I wanted to do it for him.
For the brotherhood.

01:02:08.598 --> 01:02:10.267
Then why did you
send the names to Han?

01:02:10.267 --> 01:02:12.848
Because I thought the World Court
could protect me.

01:02:12.848 --> 01:02:15.695
But now I see... nobody can.

01:02:15.695 --> 01:02:18.105
You are messed up
in some weird shit, lady.

01:02:18.105 --> 01:02:20.026
I mean man.
Whatever the hell you are.

01:02:20.026 --> 01:02:21.493
I'm a woman!

01:02:21.493 --> 01:02:24.826
And they will send a army to kill me.
To protect their way.

01:02:24.826 --> 01:02:27.154
You know what?
We can't fight no army, Lee.

01:02:27.154 --> 01:02:29.371
Who gonna protect me? I mean us?

01:02:30.502 --> 01:02:31.534
I know a place.

01:02:41.138 --> 01:02:43.510
I won't be here
when you come out. I'm sorry.

01:02:43.510 --> 01:02:47.549
My wife says I can't be a spy,
that I have to be home for dinner.

01:02:47.549 --> 01:02:50.847
The truth is I'm a driver.
Nothing more.

01:02:50.847 --> 01:02:52.648
This is my destiny.

01:02:52.648 --> 01:02:55.354
I will never know what it's like
to be an American.

01:02:55.354 --> 01:02:58.231
Never know what it feels like
to kill for no reason.

01:02:58.231 --> 01:03:00.031
George, it's OK.

01:03:01.034 --> 01:03:02.659
Thank you.

01:03:02.659 --> 01:03:04.985
Au revoir. And good luck.

01:03:04.985 --> 01:03:07.452
- Au revoir.
- Bye, George.

01:03:15.841 --> 01:03:17.547
Minister Reynard.

01:03:18.925 --> 01:03:19.922
We have it.

01:03:22.471 --> 01:03:25.389
The Shy Shen list?
This is incredible.

01:03:25.389 --> 01:03:26.755
Some people said it was a myth.

01:03:26.755 --> 01:03:29.685
Naw, it's no myth.
I've seen it. Felt it.

01:03:29.685 --> 01:03:31.431
Kissed it.
But I didn't French-kiss it.

01:03:31.431 --> 01:03:33.480
You do understand
how dangerous this is?

01:03:33.480 --> 01:03:34.941
I was gonna use protection.

01:03:34.941 --> 01:03:36.818
Can we go to the police?

01:03:36.818 --> 01:03:39.572
The triads control
too many of them here.

01:03:39.572 --> 01:03:41.945
We have to get you
out of the country.

01:03:42.992 --> 01:03:44.237
Now, my dear...

01:03:44.237 --> 01:03:48.194
would you mind taking off that wig
and showing us Shy Shen?

01:03:48.194 --> 01:03:50.163
We never told him she was the list.

01:03:55.880 --> 01:04:01.468
Look at that. 13 names linked
to centuries of tradition.

01:04:01.468 --> 01:04:04.674
The only real proof
that their secret world exists.

01:04:12.146 --> 01:04:13.806
Ugh!

01:04:13.806 --> 01:04:15.559
Geneviève, get their guns.

01:04:25.243 --> 01:04:27.152
I told you he was bad.
Didn't I tell you?

01:04:27.152 --> 01:04:27.935
No.

01:04:29.040 --> 01:04:30.070
Well, I was thinkin' it.

01:04:30.070 --> 01:04:31.494
The explosion at the embassy.

01:04:31.494 --> 01:04:33.292
As head of
the World Criminal Court...

01:04:33.292 --> 01:04:35.499
it would make sense
for me to be a target.

01:04:35.499 --> 01:04:37.081
Why did you come to my room?

01:04:37.081 --> 01:04:39.331
Geneviève was going to be killed.

01:04:39.331 --> 01:04:43.719
Having you die in the crossfire
would put an end to the investigation.

01:04:43.719 --> 01:04:46.046
Now, it will end another way.

01:04:46.046 --> 01:04:49.224
Ha ha. It's over, Reynard.

01:04:49.224 --> 01:04:51.766
You know what it's like
for old men in prison?

01:04:51.766 --> 01:04:54.891
They call you "pops."
They make you work in the library.

01:04:54.891 --> 01:04:57.272
Your best friend? Gonna be a mouse.

01:04:59.154 --> 01:05:02.237
I'm not going to prison.

01:05:02.237 --> 01:05:04.529
You have a phone call, Inspector.

01:05:10.665 --> 01:05:12.823
Hello, brother.

01:05:12.823 --> 01:05:14.576
I'd like to make a trade.

01:05:14.576 --> 01:05:18.536
Some friends of mine came across
something in Los Angeles.

01:05:18.536 --> 01:05:21.004
Something very valuable.

01:05:22.051 --> 01:05:23.629
Lee.

01:05:23.629 --> 01:05:25.760
Help me, please.

01:05:28.808 --> 01:05:30.385
Do we understand each other?

01:05:30.385 --> 01:05:31.556
What do you want?

01:05:31.556 --> 01:05:33.352
Shy Shen.

01:05:33.352 --> 01:05:36.225
You and Geneviève
will meet me alone tonight.

01:05:36.225 --> 01:05:40.812
If I see your partner
or any other cops, the girl dies.

01:05:41.696 --> 01:05:42.894
Where?

01:05:42.894 --> 01:05:48.150
Jules Verne restaurant, midnight.
Don't be late.

01:06:22.278 --> 01:06:24.770
He brought the girl.
Send the elevator down.

01:06:57.647 --> 01:07:00.220
Welcome to the party, Lee.

01:07:01.401 --> 01:07:03.857
Tonight we celebrate
the return of Shy Shen...

01:07:03.857 --> 01:07:06.864
and the return of my brother.

01:07:06.864 --> 01:07:08.573
Where is Soo Yung?

01:07:16.709 --> 01:07:17.824
Ungh.

01:07:25.551 --> 01:07:27.093
This sword has a past.

01:07:27.093 --> 01:07:30.927
And like ours, it has seen
much pain, much blood.

01:07:30.927 --> 01:07:32.558
Urgh!

01:07:34.769 --> 01:07:38.433
Hundreds of years ago
the triads would kill their enemies...

01:07:38.433 --> 01:07:40.764
with 100 cuts to the body.

01:07:40.764 --> 01:07:44.358
They would be very careful to avoid
any major arteries...

01:07:44.358 --> 01:07:48.110
so that the victim would stay alive
for as long as possible.

01:07:49.409 --> 01:07:52.907
You have just experienced
your first cut.

01:07:53.955 --> 01:07:56.161
If anything happens to Soo Yung...

01:07:57.625 --> 01:08:01.244
You could never kill me, Lee.
We both know that.

01:08:01.244 --> 01:08:03.376
You know nothing about me.

01:08:03.376 --> 01:08:08.090
I know you have no wife,
no children, no family.

01:08:08.090 --> 01:08:11.463
Your life ended when we were kids,
back in Chenzhou.

01:08:16.894 --> 01:08:19.930
You have nothing. Just like me.

01:08:21.064 --> 01:08:22.975
I wouldn't say nothin'!

01:08:27.448 --> 01:08:29.818
He has me.

01:08:29.818 --> 01:08:32.113
His brother from another mother.

01:08:38.667 --> 01:08:40.042
Where is she?

01:08:40.042 --> 01:08:41.832
Enjoying the view.

01:08:45.631 --> 01:08:46.747
Soo Yung!

01:08:46.747 --> 01:08:48.466
Lee!

01:08:50.053 --> 01:08:51.631
Help.

01:08:53.849 --> 01:08:55.093
Let her go.

01:08:55.093 --> 01:08:56.676
What the hell is wrong with you?

01:08:56.676 --> 01:08:58.261
Do you wanna die, Kenji?

01:08:58.261 --> 01:08:59.930
Get her in here!

01:09:00.897 --> 01:09:02.770
Carter, drop the gun.

01:09:02.770 --> 01:09:04.234
Get her off that damn rope,
or I'm shootin' you...

01:09:04.234 --> 01:09:05.942
and the damn Temptations.

01:09:05.942 --> 01:09:07.108
Right now!

01:09:09.029 --> 01:09:10.988
Oh, no! Lee!

01:09:12.618 --> 01:09:13.898
Lee.

01:09:13.898 --> 01:09:15.654
- Do it!
- Put her down!

01:09:15.654 --> 01:09:17.288
I'm serious!

01:09:18.457 --> 01:09:19.786
I'm not playin'!

01:09:19.786 --> 01:09:22.365
You ain't my damn brother.

01:09:22.365 --> 01:09:23.538
Kenji.

01:09:23.538 --> 01:09:25.537
- Drop the gun.
- No.

01:09:25.537 --> 01:09:26.661
Drop it, Carter.

01:09:27.758 --> 01:09:29.216
Shit.

01:09:29.216 --> 01:09:30.879
Damn it.

01:09:35.223 --> 01:09:37.131
- Tonight I lose a brother.
- Aah!

01:09:44.899 --> 01:09:46.395
Get him, Lee!

01:09:48.404 --> 01:09:50.063
Gonna get your ass kicked, Kenji.

01:10:02.793 --> 01:10:04.703
Come on, kill him already!

01:10:12.346 --> 01:10:15.131
Lee, he might be your brother,
but turn him into your sister.

01:10:31.906 --> 01:10:32.937
Watch out!

01:10:37.871 --> 01:10:39.447
Yeah!

01:10:39.447 --> 01:10:41.199
Bring your little ass here.
Come here.

01:10:44.002 --> 01:10:46.078
Aaaargh.

01:10:46.078 --> 01:10:47.451
Give me your hand.

01:10:52.301 --> 01:10:53.761
Nnngh!

01:10:56.515 --> 01:10:57.296
Ah!

01:11:00.811 --> 01:11:02.685
- Grrrah!

01:11:03.898 --> 01:11:06.565
Lee? Lee!

01:11:06.858 --> 01:11:08.815
- Gnn!
- Hold on, I'm comin'!

01:11:16.660 --> 01:11:18.119
Get the hell off me.

01:11:24.584 --> 01:11:25.783
Oh.

01:11:36.555 --> 01:11:38.180
Yeah, Lee!

01:11:39.141 --> 01:11:40.849
Whoo!

01:11:41.977 --> 01:11:43.140
Whoa!

01:12:20.642 --> 01:12:22.681
Yaaaaah!

01:12:29.066 --> 01:12:30.609
Ah! Ahhhh!

01:12:30.609 --> 01:12:33.066
Ahh... ah...

01:12:33.066 --> 01:12:34.946
Ahhhh! God da...

01:13:08.272 --> 01:13:09.601
Enough, Kenji!

01:13:09.601 --> 01:13:11.315
Grrrargh!

01:13:19.159 --> 01:13:20.035
Aaaaah!

01:13:29.377 --> 01:13:31.915
Rrrraaaargh!

01:13:40.306 --> 01:13:41.584
Rrrraargh!

01:13:42.890 --> 01:13:45.132
Hoh hoh hoh hoh

01:13:46.478 --> 01:13:50.310
# Everybody was

01:13:50.310 --> 01:13:52.640
# The man was fast as ligh... #

01:13:52.640 --> 01:13:54.360
Soo Yung!

01:13:58.073 --> 01:13:59.732
Aaaaah!

01:14:07.041 --> 01:14:09.496
What are you waiting for? Do it!

01:14:13.464 --> 01:14:14.662
Ah!

01:14:16.467 --> 01:14:18.009
Ungh!

01:14:22.765 --> 01:14:24.389
Let go.

01:14:24.389 --> 01:14:25.850
Or we're both gonna die.

01:14:25.850 --> 01:14:27.560
No! I can save you.

01:14:28.479 --> 01:14:30.473
Ungh. Grrn.

01:14:34.693 --> 01:14:35.974
Guh.

01:14:37.613 --> 01:14:38.728
Goodbye, Lee.

01:14:38.728 --> 01:14:40.020
No, Kenji!

01:14:44.578 --> 01:14:45.361
No!

01:14:50.835 --> 01:14:51.997
Aaah!

01:14:56.007 --> 01:14:57.631
Ah...

01:15:02.388 --> 01:15:03.799
Gah!

01:15:04.683 --> 01:15:05.797
Unh.

01:15:07.852 --> 01:15:08.603
Aaaah!

01:15:16.069 --> 01:15:17.895
I'm comin', Soo Yung!

01:15:22.785 --> 01:15:24.778
Oh, my God!

01:15:25.952 --> 01:15:28.444
What the hell am I doin' up here?

01:15:29.790 --> 01:15:31.534
Aah! Help.

01:15:34.671 --> 01:15:37.043
Stay cool, lady.
This doesn't have to end this way.

01:15:38.509 --> 01:15:41.081
Don't do it. Don't do it, lady.

01:15:41.081 --> 01:15:42.885
Don't you do it!

01:15:43.764 --> 01:15:45.222
Think about what you doin'.

01:15:45.222 --> 01:15:46.765
Please.

01:15:46.765 --> 01:15:48.594
Please. No.

01:15:48.594 --> 01:15:50.227
Hey. Hey!

01:15:51.313 --> 01:15:53.638
Would you like to know
a secret, cop?

01:15:53.638 --> 01:15:54.419
No.

01:15:57.694 --> 01:15:58.857
Please.

01:15:58.857 --> 01:16:01.484
Aaah! Oh, no! No!

01:16:01.484 --> 01:16:02.265
No!

01:16:03.492 --> 01:16:04.950
Aaaah!

01:16:06.066 --> 01:16:08.035
Aaah!

01:16:08.035 --> 01:16:09.948
Ah! Aaah!

01:16:09.948 --> 01:16:11.583
Ah! Aaaaaaah!

Huh!

01:16:29.935 --> 01:16:30.810
Uh! Uh!

01:16:32.562 --> 01:16:33.345

01:16:38.777 --> 01:16:41.351
Lee! You shoulda seen us, man.
We whupped their ass.

01:16:41.351 --> 01:16:43.654
Soo Yung!

01:16:43.654 --> 01:16:45.318
I'm OK.

01:16:47.453 --> 01:16:48.532
Oh, shit!

01:16:50.373 --> 01:16:51.783
Call the police.

01:17:27.034 --> 01:17:27.984

Whoa! Whoa!

01:17:51.678 --> 01:17:53.891
Whoa-oa! Whoa!

01:17:53.891 --> 01:17:55.603
Rah! Hah! Carter!

01:17:55.603 --> 01:17:57.099
- Hold on!

01:17:57.816 --> 01:18:00.354
Ah! Yaaaaah!

01:18:00.354 --> 01:18:01.856
- Aaaaah!
- Aaah!

01:18:01.856 --> 01:18:03.569
Gnn.

01:18:03.569 --> 01:18:04.603
Ah! Oh!

01:18:04.603 --> 01:18:06.773
- Hang on!

01:18:06.773 --> 01:18:09.155
- I got you!

01:18:09.155 --> 01:18:10.952
Get me up. Get me up.

01:18:10.952 --> 01:18:12.994
Come on, man. Hurry up.

01:18:12.994 --> 01:18:14.280

01:18:34.561 --> 01:18:36.103
Carter! Hold on to the flag!

01:18:36.103 --> 01:18:37.599
Wait, no, no, no, no, no, no!

01:18:37.599 --> 01:18:39.813

Aaaaaaaah!

01:18:56.667 --> 01:19:00.450
Lee, I'm gonna kill you
if we don't die!

01:19:02.380 --> 01:19:05.216
- Aaaah!
- Aaaaaah!

01:19:05.216 --> 01:19:08.503
Oh, dear Lord, please!
Baby Jesus, help us!

01:19:10.347 --> 01:19:14.215
- Aaaaaaaaah!
- Aaaaaaaaaaah!

01:19:16.145 --> 01:19:18.185
Lee! Where you at?

01:19:18.185 --> 01:19:20.560
I'm drownin'! I'm drownin'!

01:19:20.560 --> 01:19:23.104
Get this thing off me, Lee!

01:19:27.615 --> 01:19:29.157
- Carter.
- What?

01:19:29.157 --> 01:19:31.994
I'm not constipated anymore.

01:19:41.421 --> 01:19:43.461
Put your hands up.

01:19:43.461 --> 01:19:44.663
Geneviève.

01:19:44.663 --> 01:19:46.914
Hey, man, you're the head
of the World Court.

01:19:46.914 --> 01:19:49.215
What you gonna do,
shoot us down like animals?

01:19:49.215 --> 01:19:50.548
We're police officers.

01:19:50.548 --> 01:19:53.473
Yes. And you two
just killed this girl.

01:19:53.473 --> 01:19:54.933
Blew her brains out.

01:19:56.978 --> 01:19:58.141
- Carter!
- Don't do it!

01:20:20.627 --> 01:20:22.038
Carter.

01:20:22.038 --> 01:20:24.585
- You all right?
- Put the gun down.

01:20:24.585 --> 01:20:26.416
I followed you.

01:20:28.426 --> 01:20:30.633
Case closed.

01:20:37.603 --> 01:20:39.261
Good job, man.

01:20:50.115 --> 01:20:51.822
Hey, man! You touch me again...

01:20:51.822 --> 01:20:53.450
you gonna owe me
dinner and a movie.

01:20:53.450 --> 01:20:54.566
Congratulations.

01:20:54.566 --> 01:20:57.745
It appears we have finally
brought down the triads.

01:20:57.745 --> 01:20:59.491
- We?!
- You didn't do shit.

01:20:59.491 --> 01:21:00.864
My butt still hurts.

01:21:01.960 --> 01:21:03.420
The Americans and the French...

01:21:03.420 --> 01:21:06.077
need to work together
in the spirit of brotherhood.

01:21:06.077 --> 01:21:08.046
Together, we can do anything.

01:21:08.046 --> 01:21:09.710
Anything! Ha ha ha.

01:21:09.710 --> 01:21:11.842
He's right, Lee.
Together, we can do anything.

01:21:11.842 --> 01:21:12.925
You go this way...

01:21:12.925 --> 01:21:14.508
And I'll go that way.

01:21:17.893 --> 01:21:18.806
# War #

01:21:18.806 --> 01:21:20.970
# Huh, yeah #

01:21:20.970 --> 01:21:22.972
# What is it good for? #

01:21:22.972 --> 01:21:24.560
- # Absolutely #
- # Nothin' #

01:21:24.560 --> 01:21:26.477
# Uh-huh #

01:21:26.477 --> 01:21:27.483
# War #

01:21:27.483 --> 01:21:29.397
# Huh, yeah #

01:21:29.397 --> 01:21:31.694
# What is it good for? #

01:21:31.694 --> 01:21:33.359
- # Absolutely #
- # Nothin' #

01:21:33.359 --> 01:21:34.944
# Say it again, y'all #

01:21:34.944 --> 01:21:35.948
# War #

01:21:35.948 --> 01:21:38.195
# Huh, look out #

01:21:38.195 --> 01:21:40.282
# What is it good for? #

01:21:40.282 --> 01:21:41.785
- # Absolutely #
- # Nothin' #

01:21:41.785 --> 01:21:42.790
# Listen to me #

01:21:42.790 --> 01:21:43.871
# Ohhhh, war! #

01:21:45.671 --> 01:21:47.331
That's right, Lee.
For the last 3 years...

01:21:47.331 --> 01:21:49.415
I've studied the ancient teaching
of booty. Ev...

01:21:49.415 --> 01:21:51.501
Oh, booty. Ha ha ha ha!

01:21:51.501 --> 01:21:53.005
Cheese!

01:21:53.005 --> 01:21:54.673
- Ha ha ha!
- "Cheese"?

01:21:54.673 --> 01:21:57.088
- Ha ha ha ha ha!
- What?

01:21:57.088 --> 01:21:59.389
- Freeze.
- Oh, freeze!

01:22:00.353 --> 01:22:02.808
As soon as she could blink,
the s... seafood service...

01:22:02.808 --> 01:22:04.688
- Seaf... seafood...
- Secret Service.

01:22:04.688 --> 01:22:06.019
As soon as sh... she could blink...

01:22:06.019 --> 01:22:08.018
the sheafood shervish...
Uh, swa...

01:22:08.018 --> 01:22:09.226
Secret Service.

01:22:09.226 --> 01:22:11.693
The ssssseaf...

01:22:11.693 --> 01:22:13.525
Secret, not seafood.

01:22:13.525 --> 01:22:14.944
I know seafood.

01:22:14.944 --> 01:22:16.280
- I know secret.
- Secret.

01:22:16.280 --> 01:22:17.911
- Secret.
- Secret. See?

01:22:17.911 --> 01:22:20.831
But when everything together,
it become a seafood!

01:22:20.831 --> 01:22:22.953
- Ha ha ha!
- Ha ha ha ha!

01:22:22.953 --> 01:22:24.750
Action!

01:22:24.750 --> 01:22:27.042
- I'm sorry! So sorry.
- It came off.

01:22:27.042 --> 01:22:28.505
Action!

01:22:28.505 --> 01:22:30.084
- Oh, shit. You all right?
- Yeah, good.

01:22:30.084 --> 01:22:32.844
That was my... Muhammad Ali swing, man!

01:22:32.844 --> 01:22:34.719
Yeah, baby!

01:22:37.265 --> 01:22:38.260
Ooh.

01:22:38.260 --> 01:22:40.307
- Oh.
- Whoa.

01:22:40.307 --> 01:22:42.053
- That's the one, Mama.
- That would have been it.

01:22:42.053 --> 01:22:43.260
I'm sick of you, Kenji.

01:22:43.260 --> 01:22:46.724
You been tryin' to kill us
ever since the start of this damn movie.

01:22:47.818 --> 01:22:49.774
- Raaaaah!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

01:22:49.774 --> 01:22:50.557
Ah!

01:22:52.155 --> 01:22:53.235
Ah!

01:22:53.235 --> 01:22:54.272
Action.

01:22:55.868 --> 01:22:56.982
Action.

01:22:57.870 --> 01:22:58.901
Action.

01:22:58.901 --> 01:23:00.276
Ooph!

01:23:00.276 --> 01:23:01.699
You OK?

01:23:02.916 --> 01:23:05.372
So her eye is a little
droopy now and she's...

01:23:05.372 --> 01:23:07.453
So she's working for
El Loc... Lar El Poco.

01:23:07.453 --> 01:23:08.791
- Ha ha ha.
- I'm sorry.

01:23:08.791 --> 01:23:10.161
It's El Pollo Loco.

01:23:10.161 --> 01:23:12.927
So sh... now she works at
El Lolo Poco.

01:23:12.927 --> 01:23:14.173
El Pollo Loco.

01:23:14.173 --> 01:23:16.336
El Lo... Loro Poco. Uh.

01:23:16.336 --> 01:23:17.508
El Poco Loco.

01:23:17.508 --> 01:23:18.712
El Loco Poco.

01:23:18.712 --> 01:23:21.132
So... so she works at Elo... Loco Poco,

01:23:22.269 --> 01:23:23.217
Ha ha!

01:23:23.217 --> 01:23:25.518
And... So she works for
El L... Loro Poco.

01:23:25.518 --> 01:23:27.727
- Ha ha ha.
- El Pollo Loco.

01:23:27.727 --> 01:23:29.310
- No, we gonna go past that...
- Ha ha ha!

01:23:29.310 --> 01:23:30.598
...'cause I'm not gettin' that tonight.

01:23:30.598 --> 01:23:31.857
El Pollo Loco.

01:23:31.857 --> 01:23:33.736
El... Ohh! Jackie!

01:23:33.736 --> 01:23:35.365
- El Pollo Loco!
- Whoo!

01:23:43.207 --> 01:23:44.487
The mom's gone.

01:23:45.710 --> 01:23:47.252
Maybe we should
put on a dirty movie.

01:23:47.252 --> 01:23:48.616
Lee!

01:23:48.616 --> 01:23:50.753
- I like the ones with a story.
- What?

01:23:50.753 --> 01:23:53.129
- I like the one with a locker-room scene.
- What?

01:23:53.129 --> 01:23:54.711
I like the one with a prison scene.

01:23:54.711 --> 01:23:56.083
I like the one with a shower scene.

01:23:56.083 --> 01:23:57.589
I like the ones with a white girl.

01:23:57.589 --> 01:23:59.008
I'm into feet.

01:23:59.008 --> 01:24:00.758
I like the one with the horses.

01:24:00.758 --> 01:24:02.475
- What's that mean?
- Damn.

01:24:02.475 --> 01:24:03.723
What he teach me?

01:24:03.723 --> 01:24:04.926
That's it, one more, one more.
Last one.

01:24:04.926 --> 01:24:06.350
Are you teaching me a bad word?

01:24:06.350 --> 01:24:07.932
I like the one with hairy woman.

01:24:07.932 --> 01:24:09.102
What's wrong with you?

01:24:09.102 --> 01:24:10.305
I don't know. Brett Ratner tell...

01:24:10.305 --> 01:24:12.309
- teach me that.
- He'll teach you anything.

01:24:12.309 --> 01:24:14.028
And you're not my brother.

01:24:14.028 --> 01:24:16.818
I'm not your brother?

01:24:16.818 --> 01:24:18.947
All the stuff we've been through?

01:24:20.619 --> 01:24:22.328
Rush Hour 1, Rush Hour 2?

01:24:23.414 --> 01:24:25.572
- Ha ha ha.
- Ha ha ha ha ha!

01:24:28.628 --> 01:24:31.914
# Bienvenue à Paris #

01:24:31.914 --> 01:24:35.671
# C'est le retour
de Rush Hour 3 #

01:24:35.671 --> 01:24:39.461
# Avec Cee-Lo et Nas #

01:24:41.474 --> 01:24:43.597
# Attention #
# La la la la #

01:24:43.597 --> 01:24:46.009
# La la la la #

01:24:46.009 --> 01:24:48.429
# Uh-oh, yeah #

01:24:48.429 --> 01:24:52.391
# Mr. International,
the man's in a four-women love #

01:24:52.391 --> 01:24:54.858
# Voice pump out the Bose
and the tinted rose #

01:24:54.858 --> 01:24:56.904
# Craftiness, take a stab at it #

01:24:56.904 --> 01:24:58.651
# Don't ask if Nasty's back at it #

01:24:58.651 --> 01:24:59.855
# I'll run out of magic #

01:24:59.855 --> 01:25:01.990
# Popular boxcutter flow #

01:25:01.990 --> 01:25:04.450
# Time is money, the watch costs dough
shakin' the dice #

01:25:04.450 --> 01:25:06.413
# Fragrancing some beautiful ladies,
the lights #

01:25:06.413 --> 01:25:08.373
# The ambiance here,
this is the life #

01:25:08.373 --> 01:25:10.832
# The money,
hotties on each arm, it's on #

01:25:10.832 --> 01:25:12.200
# I party like a rap star #

01:25:12.200 --> 01:25:14.668
# Baby, the fat's on,
the third time's a charm #

01:25:14.668 --> 01:25:17.427
# So meet me by the Eiffel Tower,
bring a bottle of Dom #

01:25:17.427 --> 01:25:19.468
# I am here #

01:25:19.468 --> 01:25:21.927
# This is the place #

01:25:21.927 --> 01:25:26.095
# The atmosphere of espionage
and expensive taste #

01:25:26.095 --> 01:25:31.525
# And each one that I see
is an unfamiliar face #

01:25:31.525 --> 01:25:35.938
# So I guess I'll just cut
straight to the chase #

01:25:35.938 --> 01:25:42.115
# And before I could say
the name of who I came to see #

01:25:42.115 --> 01:25:43.116
# Geneviève #

01:25:43.116 --> 01:25:46.038
# Someone's suspicion, it came to me #

01:25:46.038 --> 01:25:49.623
# I'm so close, and I've come so far #

01:25:49.623 --> 01:25:54.418
# A glass of red wine sips on the woman
at the end of the bar #

01:25:54.418 --> 01:25:58.835
# I'd love to talk to you
but I don't have the time #

01:25:58.835 --> 01:26:03.257
# She looks like the prettiest part
of a perfect crime #

01:26:03.257 --> 01:26:06.799
# But if I could
I'd put a picket fence #

01:26:06.799 --> 01:26:10.594
# Around her wild flower #

01:26:10.594 --> 01:26:13.774
# But, darling, I have less than an hour #

01:26:13.774 --> 01:26:20.526
# I have less than an hour #

01:26:22.201 --> 01:26:23.661
# I have less than an hour #

01:26:29.751 --> 01:26:31.209
# Mmm #

01:26:31.209 --> 01:26:32.704
# Oh, oh, oh #

01:26:32.704 --> 01:26:37.043
# Funny how time flies
when you're having fun #

01:26:37.043 --> 01:26:38.544
# Yeah, you know #

01:26:38.544 --> 01:26:41.090
# But I got to do
what must be done #

01:26:41.090 --> 01:26:43.668
# We're on a winning streak,
we survived the killing streets #

01:26:43.668 --> 01:26:46.219
# Now you at the crap table
where the real villains meet #

01:26:46.219 --> 01:26:48.052
# Number 7 might get you to heaven #

01:26:48.052 --> 01:26:50.469
# You break the bank,
just might make you a legend #

01:26:50.469 --> 01:26:52.935
# 'Cause after 11
you plan to get some poker face #

01:26:52.935 --> 01:26:55.231
# Genie eyes, light green,
sipping on Bellinis #

01:26:55.231 --> 01:26:57.191
# You play your cards right,
she'll let you touch #

01:26:57.191 --> 01:26:59.566
# She be a devil in disguise, lady incubus #

01:26:59.566 --> 01:27:01.114
# Better know who to trust #

01:27:01.114 --> 01:27:04.402
# She might roll with thugs
who roll bodies up in Asian rugs #

01:27:04.402 --> 01:27:05.905
# I'm-a rush up and move on 'em #

01:27:05.905 --> 01:27:07.240
# Put the ooze on 'em #

01:27:07.240 --> 01:27:10.699
# The crews do somethin' new
and formal, yeah #

01:27:10.699 --> 01:27:15.454
# I have less than an hour #

01:27:15.454 --> 01:27:18.382
# Ohh, time rolls away, baby #

01:27:18.382 --> 01:27:24.671
# I have less than an hour #

01:27:24.671 --> 01:27:28.714
# Whoo, mmm #

01:27:28.714 --> 01:27:35.179
# I'm in the pursuit
of my own personal power #

01:27:35.179 --> 01:27:38.975
# And I only have an hour #

01:27:39.305 --> 01:27:45.869
