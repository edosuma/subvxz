<i>Once upon a time
there lived a bamboo cutter.</i>

01:16.744 --> 01:22.541
<i>On the mountain he would cut bamboo
to make all manner of things.</i>

01:24.919 --> 01:29.215
<i>Sanuki no Miyatsuko
was his name.</i>

01:31.592 --> 01:37.765
<i>One day he saw light
shining from a bamboo stalk.</i>

01:43.437 --> 01:46.649
<i>In wonder, he drew closer.</i>

01:51.445 --> 01:57.034
A bamboo shoot growing
before the plums flower?

02:04.375 --> 02:06.001
What's this?!

02:27.565 --> 02:28.858
Um...

02:29.316 --> 02:33.195
... may I ask who you might be?

03:03.350 --> 03:07.104
What a beautiful princess!

03:07.438 --> 03:12.526
Heaven must have sent her to me
as a blessing.

04:03.786 --> 04:05.955
Did you catch something?

04:15.673 --> 04:17.757
What a pretty doll!

04:17.882 --> 04:20.135
No, she's sleeping.

04:20.261 --> 04:21.803
What?!

04:27.101 --> 04:28.936
I've been blessed.

04:29.061 --> 04:30.187
"Blessed"?

04:30.312 --> 04:32.523
By Heaven, in the grove!

04:36.610 --> 04:38.237
It's <i>me</i> Heaven's blessed.

04:38.362 --> 04:40.239
I'm the one who'll raise her.

04:40.364 --> 04:44.159
"Raise her"? She's already
a beautiful princess.

04:44.285 --> 04:47.204
There'll be more to this than you think.

04:47.663 --> 04:48.747
Right?

04:54.545 --> 04:56.088
Give her here!

05:11.645 --> 05:15.232
Don't just sit there!
Bring me a cloth.

05:18.610 --> 05:20.029
How's this?

05:23.157 --> 05:26.035
There, there!

05:27.202 --> 05:28.537
What's going on?

05:28.704 --> 05:31.999
She wants me to raise her.

05:34.960 --> 05:37.588
Get me a nice basket.

05:38.088 --> 05:42.009
This is very strange, you know.

05:42.134 --> 05:43.677
What if she's some kind of spirit?

05:43.802 --> 05:45.637
What does she look like?

05:45.763 --> 05:47.431
A baby.

05:47.556 --> 05:48.390
Right!

05:48.515 --> 05:50.851
But just now she was a princess!

05:50.976 --> 05:57.024
That was Heaven telling us
who she'll grow into.

05:57.149 --> 05:57.983
Really?

05:58.108 --> 06:01.904
So that means
we must raise her properly.

06:02.029 --> 06:04.073
Yes! That must be it.

06:04.198 --> 06:05.449
Yes.

06:06.200 --> 06:07.826
I see!

06:07.951 --> 06:09.787
But who'll nurse her?

06:09.912 --> 06:11.747
A wet nurse.

06:11.872 --> 06:15.042
And the lathe-turners
have a new baby.

06:15.167 --> 06:16.168
So this is...

06:16.377 --> 06:18.379
A gift.

06:20.381 --> 06:21.340
What's the matter?

06:35.938 --> 06:38.732
What are you doing?!

06:41.026 --> 06:44.279
There, there!
You must be hungry.

06:44.405 --> 06:45.781
What?!

06:45.989 --> 06:49.159
She's drinking it right down.

06:50.702 --> 06:53.622
I've got milk!

07:20.607 --> 07:21.817
She laughed!

07:22.443 --> 07:24.153
She did!

07:24.778 --> 07:27.406
Suddenly she feels heavier.

07:27.531 --> 07:29.116
That can't be!

07:45.674 --> 07:46.550
Now what?

07:46.675 --> 07:47.801
She's heavier still!

07:47.926 --> 07:49.845
Let me see.

07:50.637 --> 07:53.599
She's growing really fast.

08:10.657 --> 08:13.660
Plum blossoms already!

08:23.545 --> 08:25.464
She just got heavier again!

08:25.672 --> 08:27.049
You see?

08:27.174 --> 08:29.885
Well, I'll be!

08:30.844 --> 08:36.433
<i>From that day on
the Bamboo Cutter and his wife...</i>

08:36.558 --> 08:39.895
<i>... would raise this miraculous child
as their very own.</i>

09:40.664 --> 09:44.251
No! You can't have those yet.

09:51.758 --> 09:53.176
There's a baby!

09:53.302 --> 09:55.596
Yeah? Where?

09:56.597 --> 09:58.015
Don't push!

09:58.140 --> 09:59.516
There!

10:20.078 --> 10:21.663
She looked at us!

10:21.788 --> 10:22.456
Yeah!

10:22.581 --> 10:23.832
No.

10:42.059 --> 10:43.268
What is it?

10:59.368 --> 11:00.327
Oh, my!

11:00.452 --> 11:01.578
Well, I'll be!

11:22.015 --> 11:23.475
Princess!

11:29.022 --> 11:30.357
She's standing!

11:33.694 --> 11:34.778
She's walking!

11:41.493 --> 11:43.370
Oh, my!

11:57.050 --> 11:59.261
There, there...

11:59.720 --> 12:01.304
She's funny!

12:01.430 --> 12:02.514
She walked.

12:02.639 --> 12:03.765
She was just crawling.

12:03.890 --> 12:05.434
She's growing fast!

12:05.684 --> 12:08.061
Like a bamboo shoot!

12:08.186 --> 12:09.938
That's her! Li'l Bamboo!

12:10.063 --> 12:11.106
Li'l Bamboo!

12:11.231 --> 12:12.441
Li'l Bamboo!

12:12.691 --> 12:14.109
Li'l Bamboo!

12:14.234 --> 12:15.277
Li'l Bamboo!

12:15.402 --> 12:18.947
She's not "Li'l Bamboo"!
She's "Princess"!

12:19.114 --> 12:20.782
Li'l Bamboo!

12:21.074 --> 12:22.909
Li'l Bamboo!

12:23.160 --> 12:24.786
Li'l Bamboo!

12:35.714 --> 12:37.674
Princess!

12:37.799 --> 12:39.926
Come to me!

12:40.093 --> 12:42.304
Princess!

12:47.058 --> 12:48.643
Li'l Bamboo!

12:48.935 --> 12:50.020
Li'l Bamboo!

12:50.187 --> 12:52.314
Princess!

12:52.439 --> 12:54.316
Come to me!

12:54.649 --> 12:56.401
Li'l Bamboo!

12:56.526 --> 12:58.278
Li'l Bamboo!

12:58.904 --> 13:00.822
Princess!

13:00.947 --> 13:03.241
Princess!

13:06.203 --> 13:07.621
Princess! Come to me!

13:07.913 --> 13:09.498
Princess! Come to me!

13:09.623 --> 13:10.707
Princess!

13:11.041 --> 13:13.210
Come to me!

13:55.085 --> 13:56.878
Do you want to come?

14:17.065 --> 14:19.150
Bamboo shoots. That's supper.

14:19.276 --> 14:22.863
Supper! Bamboo shoots!

14:25.699 --> 14:26.700
Right!

14:26.825 --> 14:28.827
Stand back.

14:36.334 --> 14:37.460
There's lots!

14:37.586 --> 14:39.129
Yeah!

15:10.285 --> 15:11.494
Come here!

15:40.690 --> 15:43.610
You don't mess with a wild pig!

15:45.946 --> 15:47.072
Huh?

15:48.615 --> 15:51.993
You're a strange kid.
You just got bigger.

15:52.118 --> 15:55.163
She's weird, Sutemaru.

15:55.830 --> 15:58.166
She's gotten bigger again!

15:58.291 --> 16:00.669
Like a bamboo shoot.

16:01.044 --> 16:01.920
A bamboo shoot?

16:02.045 --> 16:03.672
Bamboo shoot! Supper!

16:04.214 --> 16:06.007
Bamboo shoot!

16:06.132 --> 16:08.009
Li'l Bamboo!

16:12.555 --> 16:16.309
Round, round, go round

16:16.518 --> 16:20.313
Waterwheel, go round

16:20.522 --> 16:24.359
Go round, and call Mr Sun

16:24.484 --> 16:28.196
Go round, and call Mr Sun

16:28.613 --> 16:32.492
Birds, bugs, beasts

16:32.659 --> 16:36.371
Grass, trees, flowers

16:36.579 --> 16:40.333
Bring spring and summer,
fall and winter

16:40.500 --> 16:44.379
Bring spring and summer,
fall and winter

16:44.546 --> 16:45.505
Birds!

16:45.630 --> 16:46.589
Bugs!

16:47.173 --> 16:48.341
Beasts!

16:48.591 --> 16:49.509
Grass!

16:49.634 --> 16:50.385
Trees!

16:50.510 --> 16:51.636
Flowers!

16:53.930 --> 16:55.056
Huh?

16:55.348 --> 16:57.142
Do you know this song?

16:57.267 --> 16:58.518
Yes!

17:00.603 --> 17:04.898
Go round, come round,
come round

17:05.025 --> 17:09.445
Come round, O distant time

17:09.695 --> 17:14.200
Come round,
call back my heart

17:14.451 --> 17:19.705
Come round,
call back my heart

17:19.914 --> 17:25.045
Birds, bugs, beasts

17:25.211 --> 17:30.258
Grass, trees, flowers

17:30.717 --> 17:35.847
Teach me how to feel

17:36.181 --> 17:41.561
If I hear that you pine for me

17:41.728 --> 17:49.235
I will return to you

17:53.156 --> 17:54.574
That's a weird song.

17:54.699 --> 17:56.367
She's crying!

17:56.493 --> 17:57.702
Yeah!

17:59.120 --> 18:00.163
What's wrong?

18:01.581 --> 18:03.083
I don't know.

18:03.750 --> 18:05.293
She's weird!

18:07.921 --> 18:09.964
We live over there.

18:10.548 --> 18:12.425
That's your bamboo grove.

18:15.595 --> 18:17.680
Bamboo shoots!

18:19.766 --> 18:20.975
Let's go!

18:25.438 --> 18:28.108
Princess!

18:28.274 --> 18:29.692
Princess!

18:30.235 --> 18:32.779
Where are you?!

18:33.154 --> 18:36.199
Princess! Princess!

18:50.088 --> 18:51.506
What's that?

19:14.112 --> 19:15.655
Could this be...?

19:58.948 --> 20:00.325
See you later!

20:00.450 --> 20:02.076
Be careful!

20:03.828 --> 20:07.457
Should we be letting her
play with those boys?

20:07.582 --> 20:10.210
She's fine with them.

20:10.335 --> 20:14.422
It's just that
up in the grove I found...

20:14.839 --> 20:17.550
No. It's nothing.

20:29.771 --> 20:31.814
That's lacquer. You'll get a rash!

20:31.981 --> 20:33.274
"Lacquer"?

20:38.613 --> 20:40.156
That smells good!

20:41.074 --> 20:42.909
We'll make bowls from them.

20:43.034 --> 20:44.327
From these?

20:48.581 --> 20:49.749
Wow!

20:49.874 --> 20:52.919
That's my dad, my elder brother,
and my mom.

21:06.766 --> 21:08.309
Goodbye!

21:10.520 --> 21:12.730
Bring us something back!

21:13.273 --> 21:14.941
The Bamboo Cutter's girl.

21:16.651 --> 21:17.986
"Li'l Bamboo".

21:25.076 --> 21:28.079
Come on, Li'l Bamboo!

21:46.764 --> 21:48.683
It's so hot!

21:48.808 --> 21:51.185
I'm thirsty.

22:05.658 --> 22:08.453
I'll bet those are good.

22:08.578 --> 22:09.912
Yeah?

22:10.830 --> 22:11.914
Don't!

22:22.425 --> 22:23.551
Come on!

22:24.844 --> 22:26.012
Someone's coming!

22:40.026 --> 22:41.277
Leave it!

23:46.592 --> 23:48.428
This is for the others.

24:04.902 --> 24:06.988
This is good!

24:07.113 --> 24:08.823
This is good!

24:42.482 --> 24:46.819
When these beautiful clothes
came flying up, I knew...

24:47.069 --> 24:49.155
... what Heaven wants.

24:49.655 --> 24:51.866
What Heaven wants?

24:53.075 --> 24:58.456
It wants us to give her a life
that suits these robes.

24:58.581 --> 25:01.042
To make her a noble princess.

25:02.168 --> 25:03.836
A noble princess?

25:05.880 --> 25:10.426
With this gold, I'll build her
a fine mansion in the capital.

25:16.349 --> 25:18.226
Take her there?

25:18.351 --> 25:19.185
Yes.

25:19.310 --> 25:22.396
Out here she'll always be
just a country girl.

25:22.688 --> 25:28.194
Living with nobles
as a real princess...

25:28.319 --> 25:30.238
... she'll be happy.

25:30.363 --> 25:33.950
In any case,
that is Heaven's wish.

25:34.575 --> 25:36.410
A noble princess...

25:36.827 --> 25:37.828
Yes.

25:37.954 --> 25:41.249
Anyway, tomorrow I'll go
to the capital.

26:06.941 --> 26:10.486
<i>From the next day on,
the Bamboo Cutter...</i>

26:10.611 --> 26:14.240
<i>... went often to the capital,
with gold in his kimono.</i>

26:18.202 --> 26:24.083
<i>The summer went by,
and the autumn harvest came round.</i>

26:26.752 --> 26:30.548
Blow, O wind, blow, blow

26:30.756 --> 26:34.802
Blow hard, O wind

26:36.178 --> 26:38.306
Li'l Bamboo! Take him!

26:38.889 --> 26:42.643
Bring the fruits of the mountains

26:42.768 --> 26:50.484
Chestnuts, mushrooms, grapes...

26:51.152 --> 26:52.987
Carry me!

26:57.908 --> 27:00.286
Carry me!

27:14.550 --> 27:16.677
I'll rub it all over you!

27:20.389 --> 27:21.974
A pheasant!

27:22.975 --> 27:25.436
It's heading for you!

27:25.561 --> 27:27.897
Li'l Bamboo! Chase it left!

27:28.064 --> 27:29.148
Okay!

27:40.993 --> 27:43.037
It's coming your way!

27:52.213 --> 27:53.047
I'll get you!

28:03.140 --> 28:04.892
Sutemaru!

28:05.017 --> 28:06.394
Sutemaru!

28:08.688 --> 28:09.897
Sutemaru!

28:14.443 --> 28:16.028
Sutemaru!

28:22.660 --> 28:23.703
I got it.

28:24.704 --> 28:25.538
I got it!

28:25.871 --> 28:28.165
Great!

28:29.083 --> 28:29.917
Are you hurt?

28:30.084 --> 28:31.419
I'm coming down.

28:34.213 --> 28:35.214
No!

28:45.474 --> 28:46.976
Sutemaru!

28:47.476 --> 28:49.979
The rocks are weak here!

28:52.857 --> 28:53.774
I'm sorry.

28:54.024 --> 28:56.110
Get a long vine, will you!

28:56.235 --> 28:57.486
Sure!

28:58.863 --> 29:01.198
You're bleeding.

29:01.407 --> 29:03.659
A little spit'll fix that.

29:04.452 --> 29:05.411
No!

29:06.829 --> 29:07.955
Wait.

29:21.427 --> 29:22.762
There.

29:26.098 --> 29:27.308
Li'l Bamboo...

29:28.225 --> 29:30.186
... did you get bigger again?

29:30.311 --> 29:32.772
You think so?

29:33.773 --> 29:38.027
Somehow I have the feeling
you'll just keep on growing...

29:38.819 --> 29:41.614
... and go somewhere far away.

29:43.991 --> 29:45.993
Why do you say that?

29:46.619 --> 29:50.456
I'll always be here with you,
forever and ever.

29:50.623 --> 29:53.417
I'll always be one of your gang.

29:53.626 --> 29:55.085
Sutemaru!

29:55.211 --> 29:56.504
How's this?

29:56.837 --> 29:58.297
Good.

30:03.719 --> 30:04.595
Tie it!

30:04.720 --> 30:05.679
We did!

30:05.805 --> 30:06.806
Right!

30:10.142 --> 30:11.143
Go on.

30:15.189 --> 30:18.067
Hey, there's mushrooms here!

30:18.776 --> 30:20.194
Look, Sutemaru!

30:20.653 --> 30:21.695
You're right!

30:21.821 --> 30:25.825
Look at them all!
Tomorrow let's have a stew!

30:26.200 --> 30:28.327
Yeah! We'll cook this bird.

30:28.661 --> 30:30.329
Great! Pheasant stew!

30:30.830 --> 30:35.167
Pheasant! Pheasant! Pheasant stew!

30:48.180 --> 30:50.015
Sorry I'm late.

30:51.100 --> 30:53.352
Sutemaru caught a pheasant.

30:53.477 --> 30:55.896
And we found mushrooms and grapes!

30:59.483 --> 31:01.110
Where are you going?

31:01.402 --> 31:02.444
The capital.

31:02.570 --> 31:03.904
The capital?

31:05.114 --> 31:06.407
Me, too?

31:07.616 --> 31:08.409
Now?

31:08.534 --> 31:11.078
Yes. Leave that basket there.

31:11.245 --> 31:15.708
But I told Sutemaru
we'd all have pheasant stew.

31:15.833 --> 31:17.251
Leave it.

31:23.215 --> 31:25.551
Let's go.

31:46.238 --> 31:49.450
Will we be back in time
for stew tomorrow?

31:50.409 --> 31:56.749
<i>But for the Princess and Sutemaru,
that tomorrow never came.</i>

32:36.246 --> 32:38.499
The young miss is awake.

32:43.462 --> 32:45.506
Good morning.

33:11.782 --> 33:13.200
If you please...

33:52.531 --> 33:55.242
Well, well, well!

33:55.367 --> 33:59.663
I trust Your Highest is in
the bestest of spirits this finest...

34:00.039 --> 34:01.707
... of mornings?

34:04.543 --> 34:05.794
Momma?

34:11.382 --> 34:13.342
Poppa? Is that you?

34:22.478 --> 34:24.772
You scared me!

34:24.897 --> 34:27.608
Why are you dressed like that?

34:27.733 --> 34:29.693
It doesn't suit us, does it.

34:29.818 --> 34:30.944
Now, now!

34:31.402 --> 34:36.574
Get yourself a range of chobe,
I mean, "a change of robe"!

34:37.076 --> 34:39.119
In there.

34:45.250 --> 34:48.837
All those robes are yours,
Your Highness.

34:55.260 --> 34:56.637
They smell so nice!

35:03.060 --> 35:04.645
They're beautiful!

35:09.108 --> 35:11.485
Like a rainbow!

35:16.949 --> 35:19.743
I'm glad she likes them.

35:19.868 --> 35:21.245
I told you!

35:21.453 --> 35:24.665
You're going to live here now.

35:28.710 --> 35:29.837
In this mansion?!

35:29.962 --> 35:31.338
Yes.

35:39.847 --> 35:41.682
Wow!

36:09.668 --> 36:12.629
Poppa, can I swim in there?

36:15.507 --> 36:18.302
You most certainly may not.

36:21.471 --> 36:26.768
A noble princess does not frolic
and dance around in such a manner.

36:28.061 --> 36:29.396
Your Highness...

36:29.521 --> 36:35.569
... I've summoned Lady Sagami
from the palace to teach you...

36:35.694 --> 36:38.572
... the ways of a noble princess.

36:38.697 --> 36:40.574
A "noble princess"?

36:41.366 --> 36:42.743
"Palace"?

36:45.329 --> 36:50.417
I have never met a child
so much in need of my instruction.

36:50.626 --> 36:57.674
I will undertake to make her
a truly fine lady.

36:59.343 --> 37:02.221
<i>And so with Lady Sagami...</i>

37:02.346 --> 37:06.767
<i>... the princess began to learn
the noble airs and graces of a lady.</i>

37:07.476 --> 37:09.102
Watch carefully.

37:09.561 --> 37:14.566
One holds one's back straight,
and stands with a "swish".

37:16.193 --> 37:17.444
"Swish"?

37:19.488 --> 37:21.782
That will do for now.

37:21.990 --> 37:26.453
In any event, a noble lady stands
only on rare occasions.

37:27.746 --> 37:30.791
Then how do I move
to pick something up?

37:30.916 --> 37:31.750
In that case...

37:31.875 --> 37:32.626
... thus!

37:32.751 --> 37:37.130
One proceeds on one's knees,
and <i>always</i> gracefully.

37:42.261 --> 37:44.096
Be graceful at all times...

37:46.598 --> 37:49.977
Your Highness!

37:55.565 --> 37:57.317
Beautiful, is it not?

37:57.442 --> 38:01.989
Unroll it like this, and the story
flows out in the pictures.

38:05.200 --> 38:07.661
Yeah! It really flows!

38:18.797 --> 38:20.924
Let us have a short rest.

38:21.717 --> 38:25.512
Your enthusiasm
for practicing handwriting...

38:25.804 --> 38:28.515
... makes me proud.

38:36.481 --> 38:37.941
Your Highness!

38:45.115 --> 38:47.784
Once more, together.

38:53.165 --> 38:54.875
Hey, this is fun!

38:55.000 --> 38:56.543
Your Highness!

38:57.502 --> 38:58.337
Well?

38:58.670 --> 39:01.715
How's the koto practice going?

39:01.840 --> 39:03.717
Sir!

39:09.848 --> 39:13.560
I trust you are well, Father.

39:13.685 --> 39:15.062
Well, well, well!

39:19.274 --> 39:22.194
You're so elegant
I hardly recognized you.

39:22.319 --> 39:23.403
Whoops!

39:24.196 --> 39:27.157
And how is the koto lesson going?

39:27.282 --> 39:31.370
We've only just begun...

39:43.882 --> 39:46.385
Well, well, well!

39:54.017 --> 39:58.772
With me, she treats everything
as if it were a game.

39:58.897 --> 40:02.734
But then instantly
she does everything perfectly.

40:02.859 --> 40:04.778
That makes sense.

40:05.070 --> 40:07.781
She is truly a princess from Heaven.

40:07.906 --> 40:11.952
She is not one to stay forever
out in the mountains.

40:14.204 --> 40:20.252
<i>Thus the princess seemed devoted
to making a noble lady of herself.</i>

40:47.028 --> 40:48.280
Whoops!

40:49.614 --> 40:51.491
What's going on here?!

40:51.616 --> 40:54.453
Will you stop doing all this!

40:54.578 --> 40:58.123
You are now the mother
of a noble princess.

40:58.248 --> 41:01.334
But this makes me feel at home.

41:01.460 --> 41:05.338
It's because of you
the princess won't...

41:09.092 --> 41:11.052
Is something the matter?

41:12.304 --> 41:14.514
You're very quiet.

41:14.639 --> 41:16.683
Well, Husband...

41:25.317 --> 41:27.694
Is that true?

41:27.819 --> 41:29.029
Yes.

41:29.738 --> 41:33.533
That's wonderful!
We'll have to hold a banquet!

41:33.658 --> 41:34.784
A banquet?

41:34.910 --> 41:37.120
To mark your coming of age.

41:37.245 --> 41:40.332
This is the happiest of occasions!

41:40.749 --> 41:43.126
So we can invite my friends?

41:44.669 --> 41:46.713
I miss them so much!

41:47.005 --> 41:50.884
That might be nice.

41:51.259 --> 41:52.552
Don't be a fool!

41:52.677 --> 41:56.056
Do you realize
how important this is?!

41:57.516 --> 42:01.728
We live in a different world
to those hillbillies!

42:02.479 --> 42:05.524
We'll have the naming ceremony
after New Year's.

42:05.690 --> 42:10.904
After your coming-out banquet
you'll be a true princess!

42:12.197 --> 42:13.323
Poppa...

42:13.448 --> 42:16.576
This is wonderful!

42:16.701 --> 42:20.914
I know! I'll ask Inbe no Akita
to be your "Name Father".

42:23.375 --> 42:25.627
Is anyone here?!

42:26.002 --> 42:29.214
Lady Sagami? Lady Sagami!

42:33.552 --> 42:34.761
What a bore.

43:12.924 --> 43:18.471
Birds, bugs, beasts

43:18.930 --> 43:23.810
Grass, trees, flowers...

43:25.437 --> 43:29.149
Momma, can I use
this piece of the garden?

43:29.274 --> 43:29.983
Sorry?

43:30.150 --> 43:32.944
To plant things I like.

43:33.111 --> 43:35.655
Why, of course you can.

43:35.780 --> 43:38.241
Do what you like with it.

43:38.366 --> 43:40.493
Thanks, Momma.

44:02.766 --> 44:04.643
No! Never!

44:09.481 --> 44:12.817
You'll never be a fine princess
looking like that.

44:12.984 --> 44:15.362
I'll get sweat in my eyes
if you pluck my eyebrows!

44:15.487 --> 44:19.658
A noble princess does not sweat.

44:19.783 --> 44:20.659
Now...

44:20.784 --> 44:23.536
And blackened teeth
just look weird!

44:23.703 --> 44:25.705
How will I laugh?

44:25.830 --> 44:30.043
A noble princess does not
open her mouth and laugh.

44:30.335 --> 44:31.378
That's stupid!

44:31.503 --> 44:36.216
Even a princess must sweat
and laugh out loud sometimes!

44:36.508 --> 44:38.218
Or want to cry.

44:38.343 --> 44:40.136
Or get mad and shout!

44:40.303 --> 44:42.389
No. A noble princess...

44:43.014 --> 44:45.892
Then a noble princess isn't human!

44:51.481 --> 44:52.565
Your Highness!

44:52.691 --> 44:55.652
The poor thing was tied up!

44:59.531 --> 45:01.074
Your Highness!

45:03.535 --> 45:06.579
This way, Lord Akita.

45:37.402 --> 45:38.486
Your Highness!

45:43.908 --> 45:47.245
I'm very sorry!
She's still very young.

45:47.370 --> 45:48.955
Not at all.

45:49.080 --> 45:52.417
She's an adorable little princess.

45:55.920 --> 46:00.925
She has yet to be made up.
I am truly ashamed.

46:01.050 --> 46:03.762
Don't give it a second thought.

46:03.928 --> 46:06.765
To observe her as she really is...

46:06.890 --> 46:11.478
... will help me think of
an appropriate name.

46:11.603 --> 46:13.271
I am glad to hear that.

46:13.396 --> 46:18.151
Please bestow a fine name
on our princess.

46:18.860 --> 46:23.323
Your Highness,
come and greet Lord Akita.

46:50.475 --> 46:53.019
How do you do, sir.

46:54.646 --> 47:00.693
Your Highness, let Lord Akita
hear you play on the koto.

47:28.137 --> 47:30.390
Beautiful!

47:32.851 --> 47:36.729
"The Shining Princess
of the Supple Bamboo"...

47:38.356 --> 47:39.899
"The Princess...

47:40.024 --> 47:41.693
"Kaguya"?

47:41.818 --> 47:42.902
Yes.

47:43.027 --> 47:46.739
A form as graceful
as slender bamboo...

47:46.948 --> 47:49.909
... and a beauty
that shines out from her.

47:50.034 --> 47:54.330
I give her a name
that means "shining light".

47:54.873 --> 47:58.084
I thus suggest "Princess Kaguya".

47:58.209 --> 48:00.086
"Princess Kaguya"!

48:01.379 --> 48:05.758
Lord Akita, you have given her
a truly fine name.

48:06.009 --> 48:08.094
Thank you very much.

48:50.428 --> 48:55.266
<i>Following the rites of hair
and trailing skirt...</i>

48:55.433 --> 48:58.478
<i>... guests were invited
in great numbers...</i>

48:58.937 --> 49:03.483
<i>... to a banquet celebrating
the taking of her name.</i>

49:13.952 --> 49:16.746
Congratulations!

49:16.871 --> 49:20.500
"Princess Kaguya"
certainly is a fine name.

49:44.482 --> 49:48.027
There are so many
fine gentlemen here!

49:48.987 --> 49:53.366
This is a banquet to celebrate
the taking of my name?

49:53.491 --> 49:55.535
Yes, it is.

49:55.660 --> 49:59.372
But all I'm doing is sitting.

49:59.664 --> 50:03.668
I may as well
not even be here.

50:28.484 --> 50:30.737
Thank you very much!

50:30.862 --> 50:36.576
<i>Princess Kaguya's naming banquet
went on for three days and nights.</i>

50:37.952 --> 50:42.373
To Princess Kaguya having
her hair put up!

50:42.498 --> 50:44.375
'Tis a fine thing!

50:44.500 --> 50:48.504
A fine thing! A fine thing!

50:57.889 --> 51:01.601
But isn't this all
a bit pretentious?

51:01.851 --> 51:04.270
Your "princess".

51:04.395 --> 51:07.857
Princess Kaguya, or whoever it is...

51:07.982 --> 51:11.235
... enshrined behind
that bamboo blind.

51:11.360 --> 51:15.782
What's wrong with us seeing
if she's as beautiful as they say?

51:16.741 --> 51:19.952
No! Anything but that!

51:20.203 --> 51:24.916
So we come to celebrate
and we can't even say hello?

51:25.041 --> 51:27.376
That's the custom!

51:27.502 --> 51:30.630
The custom for noble women,
not commoners.

51:30.755 --> 51:31.547
Hey!

51:31.672 --> 51:34.383
She's not a real princess.

51:34.509 --> 51:37.303
She <i>is</i> a princess!

51:38.930 --> 51:42.809
What did it cost
to get her named one?

51:42.934 --> 51:45.645
At least let us see her!

51:46.437 --> 51:48.314
Maybe she's ugly!

51:48.439 --> 51:49.816
What a farce!

54:44.156 --> 54:45.199
Um...

54:46.325 --> 54:50.663
... would you know what happened to
the people who lived down below?

54:50.997 --> 54:54.208
I wouldn't know.

54:54.834 --> 54:59.380
They're on a journey
looking for good trees.

54:59.630 --> 55:00.715
A journey?

55:00.840 --> 55:03.050
They won't be back for ten years.

55:03.509 --> 55:04.885
Ten years?

55:05.344 --> 55:09.056
Use up all the trees
and you kill the mountain.

55:09.348 --> 55:14.061
Leave its power and go away,
and it revives.

55:14.687 --> 55:18.607
Give the trees ten years,
and you can work them again.

55:18.941 --> 55:21.235
Charcoal's like that, too.

55:22.361 --> 55:27.074
But what if the mountain
really is dead?

55:27.199 --> 55:30.244
The leaves were so beautiful...

55:34.707 --> 55:37.084
It's not dead.

55:42.381 --> 55:43.549
Look.

55:44.884 --> 55:48.095
The trees are getting ready
for spring.

55:49.889 --> 55:51.599
They are?

55:52.058 --> 55:53.934
Will spring come back here?

55:54.060 --> 55:55.770
Sure it will.

55:55.895 --> 56:01.942
Now the trees are waiting
for it to come round again.

56:02.568 --> 56:04.278
But who...

56:32.098 --> 56:36.143
I've seen this before.

58:28.881 --> 58:32.426
<i>From that day on,
Princess Kaguya...</i>

58:32.551 --> 58:37.598
<i>... was like a different person,
devoting herself to her studies...</i>

58:37.723 --> 58:41.435
<i>... in pensive silence.</i>

58:42.728 --> 58:44.772
Your Highness!

58:50.903 --> 58:54.323
Look at all these gifts!

58:54.448 --> 58:58.786
The nobility has accepted you
as one of them!

58:59.078 --> 59:02.456
This is the proof!

59:10.089 --> 59:12.800
For old times' sake...

59:12.925 --> 59:18.973
... I'll weave you a fine bamboo cage
for this meadow bunting.

59:20.266 --> 59:22.977
Thank you, Father.

59:29.608 --> 59:32.152
Thanks be to Heaven!

59:33.445 --> 59:35.656
Thanks be to Heaven!

59:36.282 --> 59:38.659
I'll just leave this here.

01:00:18.490 --> 01:00:21.702
<i>As word of this great beauty spread...</i>

01:00:21.910 --> 01:00:25.372
<i>... huge crowds gathered
outside the mansion...</i>

01:00:25.831 --> 01:00:29.376
<i>... hoping to catch a glimpse of
Princess Kaguya.</i>

01:00:37.343 --> 01:00:39.511
Do you serve Princess Kaguya?

01:00:40.512 --> 01:00:42.389
Then give her this!

01:00:42.514 --> 01:00:44.058
Please!

01:00:44.183 --> 01:00:45.559
And this!

01:00:53.984 --> 01:00:56.779
There's another crowd
of gentlemen outside.

01:00:58.697 --> 01:01:03.744
They've given me
all these letters for you.

01:01:04.370 --> 01:01:07.748
And I brought you
some cherry blossoms...

01:01:07.873 --> 01:01:11.919
... because you can't go out
with that crowd outside.

01:01:13.337 --> 01:01:14.588
Thank you!

01:01:44.743 --> 01:01:48.288
You summoned me,
Prince Ishitsukuri?

01:01:52.251 --> 01:01:55.629
About that rich upstart's daughter
that you named...

01:01:55.754 --> 01:01:58.424
You mean Princess Kaguya?

01:01:58.757 --> 01:02:00.134
Keep your voice down!

01:02:00.259 --> 01:02:02.469
Did you say "Princess Kaguya"?

01:02:02.594 --> 01:02:06.974
Princess Kaguya?
I've heard the gossip about her.

01:02:07.099 --> 01:02:09.351
They say she's very beautiful.

01:02:09.935 --> 01:02:12.187
You would shout, wouldn't you.

01:02:12.604 --> 01:02:15.983
Beautiful she may be,
but she is of humble birth.

01:02:16.108 --> 01:02:19.153
She is not a woman
for any of us.

01:02:19.278 --> 01:02:24.491
"Princess Kaguya" is
a presumptuous name...

01:02:24.616 --> 01:02:27.745
... for a daughter of
the likes of Miyatsuko.

01:02:27.870 --> 01:02:29.621
No, Minister.

01:02:30.122 --> 01:02:33.834
She is not his true daughter.

01:02:33.959 --> 01:02:36.336
She was born from a bamboo stalk.

01:02:36.462 --> 01:02:37.963
A bamboo stalk?

01:02:38.130 --> 01:02:41.717
How interesting.
So she's a woodland spirit?

01:02:41.967 --> 01:02:46.263
That is not entirely impossible,
Lord Counselor.

01:02:46.597 --> 01:02:47.514
What?!

01:02:47.639 --> 01:02:51.810
The moment I stood before her...

01:02:52.144 --> 01:02:55.689
... this aged body began to tremble...

01:02:55.814 --> 01:02:59.359
... as if a dry fountain
had come back to life.

01:02:59.985 --> 01:03:05.032
Just the memory of
that glimmering beauty...

01:03:05.324 --> 01:03:09.953
... leaves me completely lost for words!

01:03:19.171 --> 01:03:20.506
Stand aside!

01:03:30.015 --> 01:03:31.725
I will win this race!

01:03:32.017 --> 01:03:34.144
I will be first!

01:03:34.269 --> 01:03:37.523
That glimmering beauty will be mine!

01:03:37.689 --> 01:03:39.900
I will have her!

01:03:40.192 --> 01:03:42.069
I go to meet my wife!

01:03:51.870 --> 01:03:54.623
Lady Sagami! Lady Sagami!

01:03:55.374 --> 01:03:56.458
What is it?

01:03:56.708 --> 01:03:58.418
Look at these!

01:03:58.585 --> 01:04:02.548
Five of the land's highest-born men
have come...

01:04:02.798 --> 01:04:04.758
... and in formal dress!

01:04:04.883 --> 01:04:05.884
Oh, my!

01:04:06.260 --> 01:04:08.595
Thanks be to Heaven!

01:04:08.720 --> 01:04:11.265
A minister, two princes...

01:04:11.557 --> 01:04:15.435
But how will we choose among them?

01:04:15.727 --> 01:04:20.107
They're all here together,
awaiting an answer.

01:04:20.232 --> 01:04:23.277
I understand.
Leave the princess to me.

01:04:23.402 --> 01:04:25.946
You go entertain them.

01:04:26.071 --> 01:04:27.281
I will!

01:04:27.406 --> 01:04:30.075
Thank you very much!

01:04:31.952 --> 01:04:33.996
Thanks be to Heaven!

01:04:34.121 --> 01:04:37.624
That banquet was worth
every penny I spent on it!

01:04:39.084 --> 01:04:41.753
They are all of the highest rank.

01:04:41.879 --> 01:04:45.132
You will not go wrong
with any of them.

01:04:45.257 --> 01:04:48.802
So, Your Highness,
choose the one you wish.

01:04:49.011 --> 01:04:51.138
Even though I don't know them?

01:04:51.430 --> 01:04:52.556
Of course.

01:04:52.681 --> 01:04:58.979
A gentleman makes a proposal,
and you meet on your wedding day.

01:04:59.396 --> 01:05:03.525
With your choice
of these five nobles...

01:05:03.650 --> 01:05:06.778
... how happy you will be!

01:05:07.112 --> 01:05:08.822
"Happy"?

01:05:10.782 --> 01:05:13.660
I have no wish
to marry anyone yet.

01:05:13.785 --> 01:05:15.329
You can't mean that!

01:05:15.454 --> 01:05:20.292
You must marry a suitable gentleman
as soon as possible.

01:05:20.459 --> 01:05:23.003
That is happiness itself.

01:05:23.128 --> 01:05:24.838
Why would you hesitate?

01:05:24.963 --> 01:05:29.009
With any of those men,
your happiness is assured.

01:05:29.134 --> 01:05:31.136
I will not choose any of them!

01:05:31.303 --> 01:05:33.513
Please ask them to leave.

01:05:35.974 --> 01:05:39.353
Do you wish to hurt your father?

01:05:40.395 --> 01:05:44.483
He is as glad for you
as he would be for himself.

01:05:55.994 --> 01:06:01.041
All has been made ready.
If you would come this way...

01:06:25.857 --> 01:06:30.070
Now, if you would each speak
in order of precedence.

01:06:31.863 --> 01:06:35.075
I am Prince Kuramochi.

01:06:35.200 --> 01:06:36.576
Princess...

01:06:37.202 --> 01:06:43.583
... my feelings toward you are
as I wrote in my letter.

01:06:44.459 --> 01:06:50.590
If it came to pass
that you became my wife...

01:06:50.716 --> 01:06:55.762
... my joy would be as if I had found
a jeweled branch from a tree...

01:06:55.887 --> 01:06:58.098
... of Mount Horai in China...

01:06:58.223 --> 01:07:01.435
... with silver roots, gold trunk,
and pearls for fruit.

01:07:01.727 --> 01:07:07.274
To me, you are a treasure
as unattainable as that.

01:07:07.399 --> 01:07:08.275
If you would...

01:07:08.400 --> 01:07:12.612
I am Prince Ishitsukuri.
If you consent to be my wife...

01:07:12.738 --> 01:07:16.950
... I will worship you day and night,
my forehead to the ground...

01:07:17.075 --> 01:07:21.955
... as I would the stone begging bowl
of Lord Buddha himself in India.

01:07:22.080 --> 01:07:25.625
You would treat her
as a piece of cold stone?

01:07:26.418 --> 01:07:29.921
To me you are
as a robe of fire-rat fur.

01:07:30.047 --> 01:07:33.759
Put in the flames,
all impurities burn away...

01:07:33.884 --> 01:07:36.803
... but it is not consumed,
and merely glistens...

01:07:36.928 --> 01:07:39.014
... all the brighter.

01:07:39.264 --> 01:07:45.645
You are as pure
as this rare treasure of China.

01:07:45.771 --> 01:07:49.983
You compare Princess Kaguya
to a rat-skin?

01:07:50.108 --> 01:07:52.319
To me, Princess...

01:07:52.444 --> 01:07:56.656
... you are a jewel
that glistens more radiantly...

01:07:56.782 --> 01:08:01.787
... than the five-colored stone
that shines from the dragon's neck!

01:08:01.953 --> 01:08:02.829
No, no, no!

01:08:02.954 --> 01:08:04.998
To me, Princess Kaguya...

01:08:05.123 --> 01:08:10.504
... is like the cowry shell
the swallow warms as a treasure...

01:08:10.629 --> 01:08:15.092
... and a charm for safe birth.

01:08:15.467 --> 01:08:16.343
"A treasure"...

01:08:16.468 --> 01:08:20.846
A cowry shell is a treasure?
It is to laugh!

01:08:21.473 --> 01:08:24.559
Well, a dragon's neck stinks!

01:08:24.893 --> 01:08:26.685
It's the jewel <i>on</i> the neck!

01:08:50.669 --> 01:08:53.380
What a beautiful melody!

01:08:54.339 --> 01:08:59.051
I am grateful for these sentiments
toward someone...

01:08:59.678 --> 01:09:02.721
... you have neither met nor seen.

01:09:03.849 --> 01:09:04.850
I ask...

01:09:06.977 --> 01:09:09.895
... that you bring me...

01:09:10.354 --> 01:09:13.358
... these rare treasures
of which you speak.

01:09:14.317 --> 01:09:19.906
Then I will be able
to feel clearly in my heart...

01:09:20.031 --> 01:09:22.742
... how you treasure me.

01:09:23.868 --> 01:09:28.415
Prince Kuramochi, bring me
the jeweled branch of Horai.

01:09:28.790 --> 01:09:32.419
Prince Ishitsukuri,
Lord Buddha's stone bowl.

01:09:32.544 --> 01:09:33.587
But... but...

01:09:33.712 --> 01:09:38.258
Lord Minister of the Right Abe,
bring a robe of fire-rat fur.

01:09:38.383 --> 01:09:39.301
What?!

01:09:39.426 --> 01:09:44.430
Grand Counselor Otomo,
the jewel from the dragon's neck.

01:09:45.223 --> 01:09:51.270
And Middle Counselor Isonokami,
the swallow's cowry shell.

01:09:51.395 --> 01:09:52.606
Impossible!

01:09:52.731 --> 01:09:54.274
No, no no no...

01:09:54.441 --> 01:09:57.777
These things may not even exist!

01:09:57.903 --> 01:10:01.323
They were only figures of speech!

01:10:01.573 --> 01:10:02.782
Yes.

01:10:03.033 --> 01:10:08.455
You have all compared me
to very rare treasures.

01:10:08.747 --> 01:10:12.751
If I can obtain one of them...

01:10:13.418 --> 01:10:17.797
... I will happily become
that gentleman's "treasure".

01:10:19.424 --> 01:10:21.968
Gentlemen, I apologize!

01:10:22.093 --> 01:10:24.763
She knows nothing of the world.

01:10:24.930 --> 01:10:28.975
But she must be beautiful.
Her voice, her music...

01:10:29.100 --> 01:10:32.896
Indeed! That melody was
quite out of this world.

01:10:33.104 --> 01:10:36.983
But to set us
these impossible tasks...

01:10:37.275 --> 01:10:39.319
Out of the question!

01:10:39.444 --> 01:10:42.697
She is truly
an unattainable treasure.

01:10:49.287 --> 01:10:50.664
It's terrible!

01:10:50.956 --> 01:10:55.168
When the nobles left,
so did everyone else outside!

01:10:55.293 --> 01:10:58.171
Just like the tide going out?

01:10:58.296 --> 01:10:59.506
Yes.

01:10:59.631 --> 01:11:01.549
I thought I should tell you.

01:11:04.135 --> 01:11:05.553
Your Highness!

01:11:10.141 --> 01:11:11.351
Let's go!

01:11:11.476 --> 01:11:12.686
Where?

01:11:12.811 --> 01:11:13.687
Out!

01:11:13.812 --> 01:11:14.771
Out?

01:11:14.938 --> 01:11:16.815
To see the cherry blossoms!

01:11:17.148 --> 01:11:20.860
Go ask Father and Mother
to come, too!

01:11:22.654 --> 01:11:25.490
There is nothing more I can do.

01:11:25.615 --> 01:11:27.826
Yes, but surely...

01:11:28.118 --> 01:11:30.996
Next time the princess will...

01:11:31.121 --> 01:11:33.999
There will be no next time.

01:11:34.374 --> 01:11:38.503
I will take my leave of you.

01:11:38.670 --> 01:11:40.672
But...

01:11:44.634 --> 01:11:48.305
The carriage the princess requested
awaits, Squire.

01:11:48.596 --> 01:11:51.308
Tell them to go on ahead!

01:12:49.366 --> 01:12:51.076
Oh, my!

01:12:59.709 --> 01:13:01.252
It's beautiful!

01:13:04.798 --> 01:13:05.548
Stop!

01:13:11.179 --> 01:13:12.347
Your Highness?

01:13:33.284 --> 01:13:35.286
How wonderful!

01:14:21.124 --> 01:14:23.334
I'm very sorry, Milady.

01:14:26.796 --> 01:14:29.174
Please forgive us!

01:14:34.971 --> 01:14:36.181
Come on.

01:14:50.904 --> 01:14:52.864
They're right at their peak.

01:14:52.989 --> 01:14:56.117
Yes, they're beautiful.

01:15:03.166 --> 01:15:04.542
Let's go home.

01:15:56.010 --> 01:15:58.930
Something's happened up ahead.

01:15:59.055 --> 01:16:00.598
Someone's coming.

01:16:00.723 --> 01:16:01.766
Sutemaru!

01:16:01.891 --> 01:16:02.600
Run!

01:16:02.767 --> 01:16:03.518
Sutemaru?

01:16:14.070 --> 01:16:15.613
Sutemaru!

01:16:17.407 --> 01:16:18.491
Sutemaru!

01:16:31.588 --> 01:16:32.797
What's wrong?!

01:16:32.922 --> 01:16:34.507
They'll catch us!

01:16:36.551 --> 01:16:37.802
We're going!

01:16:50.106 --> 01:16:51.149
Li'l Bamboo!

01:17:09.292 --> 01:17:11.002
Sutemaru!

01:17:12.295 --> 01:17:13.838
Sutemaru!

01:17:13.963 --> 01:17:15.673
Sutemaru!

01:17:25.808 --> 01:17:27.018
Come on.

01:18:00.009 --> 01:18:04.555
<i>Three years went by.</i>

01:18:48.891 --> 01:18:50.101
Off you go.

01:19:02.530 --> 01:19:06.951
Isn't it a lovely day.
Look how the garden has grown.

01:19:07.076 --> 01:19:09.287
Yes, but you know...

01:19:11.122 --> 01:19:14.459
... it all looks different
when you see it from here.

01:19:22.258 --> 01:19:23.259
Well!

01:19:27.930 --> 01:19:30.141
It's like the mountain back home.

01:19:30.266 --> 01:19:31.267
You're right.

01:19:31.934 --> 01:19:34.979
There's the forest, and the hill...

01:19:35.104 --> 01:19:37.315
And there's our house.

01:19:37.440 --> 01:19:40.485
And the grass is the bamboo grove.

01:19:40.610 --> 01:19:42.987
The mugwort looks just like trees.

01:19:43.446 --> 01:19:47.158
You can almost see the moon
rising behind the mountain.

01:19:47.283 --> 01:19:50.787
And we could go over the bridge
and up the hill...

01:19:50.953 --> 01:19:52.330
Princess!

01:19:52.622 --> 01:19:55.166
Where is Her Highness?

01:19:55.792 --> 01:19:57.168
You're here again?

01:19:57.293 --> 01:19:58.836
What's wrong with it?

01:19:58.961 --> 01:20:00.630
You're here all the time!

01:20:00.797 --> 01:20:02.673
Anyway, not now.

01:20:03.299 --> 01:20:04.342
The Prince!

01:20:04.467 --> 01:20:08.763
Prince Kuramochi has brought
the jeweled branch of Horai!

01:20:09.555 --> 01:20:10.765
Impossible!

01:20:10.890 --> 01:20:14.018
It's hard to believe,
but he's true to his word.

01:20:14.143 --> 01:20:18.022
You'd think he'd be angry
with a task like that...

01:20:18.147 --> 01:20:22.860
... but he really has brought back
a jeweled branch!

01:20:23.653 --> 01:20:28.032
Your Highness, go and get ready
for your wedding!

01:20:28.157 --> 01:20:29.700
I should hurry!

01:20:29.826 --> 01:20:33.204
The two of them will need
a bedchamber!

01:20:35.164 --> 01:20:39.168
If only Lady Sagami were here!

01:20:40.837 --> 01:20:42.463
This can't be right!

01:20:43.339 --> 01:20:44.882
A bedchamber...

01:20:48.344 --> 01:20:49.595
Princess Kaguya!

01:20:49.846 --> 01:20:52.056
Where is Princess Kaguya?

01:20:52.181 --> 01:20:54.642
Please wait, Your Highness!

01:20:57.186 --> 01:20:59.105
Squire Miyatsuko!

01:20:59.522 --> 01:21:01.399
Forgive me.

01:21:01.524 --> 01:21:06.904
I was in such a rush to get here
I didn't change my clothes.

01:21:07.029 --> 01:21:11.325
Oh, this is wonderful!
Thanks be to Heaven!

01:21:11.492 --> 01:21:13.578
Please... this way.

01:21:16.372 --> 01:21:17.915
Come in.

01:21:35.057 --> 01:21:39.270
Without further ado,
I will show what I promised to bring.

01:21:58.247 --> 01:22:01.626
It's so beautiful it dazzles the eye!

01:22:01.751 --> 01:22:06.297
As you wished,
the jeweled branch of Horai.

01:22:07.089 --> 01:22:10.551
Princess Kaguya,
are you in there?

01:22:11.093 --> 01:22:14.472
Come near and take a good look.

01:22:14.597 --> 01:22:16.140
One moment.

01:22:16.766 --> 01:22:22.813
First, allow me to ask
how you came by it.

01:22:23.272 --> 01:22:25.483
Of course!

01:22:42.917 --> 01:22:46.462
Three years ago
I vowed to carry out your wish.

01:22:46.629 --> 01:22:48.506
I boarded a ship...

01:22:48.631 --> 01:22:52.677
... and we set course
for Mount Horai.

01:22:53.135 --> 01:22:55.513
Tossed by angry waves...

01:22:55.638 --> 01:22:58.516
... and starving for lack of food...

01:22:58.641 --> 01:23:02.520
... after all manner of
trials and tribulations...

01:23:03.980 --> 01:23:05.022
... "Behold!

01:23:05.147 --> 01:23:10.695
"What is that mountain,
so beautiful yet forbidding?

01:23:11.821 --> 01:23:13.698
"Amazing!

01:23:13.823 --> 01:23:17.702
"It flows with water of gold,
silver, and lapis lazuli!

01:23:18.160 --> 01:23:19.203
"Look!

01:23:19.662 --> 01:23:23.040
"A celestial maiden scoops water
with a silver bowl!

01:23:23.833 --> 01:23:25.292
"Hello!

01:23:25.835 --> 01:23:28.546
"What is the name
of this mountain?"

01:23:30.006 --> 01:23:33.050
"This is Mount Horai.

01:23:33.676 --> 01:23:37.388
"And my name is Ukanruri."

01:23:39.181 --> 01:23:43.561
At last I had made my way
to Mount Horai!

01:23:44.520 --> 01:23:49.567
Without a second glance at the maiden,
I climbed the mountain.

01:23:51.027 --> 01:23:54.071
"Look at those beautiful trees!

01:23:54.530 --> 01:23:59.910
"Silver branches, trunks of gold,
and fruit of pearls!

01:24:00.036 --> 01:24:02.580
"How beautiful!

01:24:02.913 --> 01:24:07.251
"Are these not
the jeweled branches of Horai...

01:24:07.376 --> 01:24:10.421
"... Princess Kaguya said
she wished for?"

01:24:11.589 --> 01:24:16.761
This is the branch
I snapped off then.

01:24:24.560 --> 01:24:27.104
One look is worth a hundred tales.

01:24:27.271 --> 01:24:30.608
Look upon it with your own eyes.

01:24:39.075 --> 01:24:40.284
No! You can't do this!

01:24:40.409 --> 01:24:42.620
Get out of my way!

01:24:44.246 --> 01:24:46.290
What is the meaning of this?

01:24:46.457 --> 01:24:49.627
I most humbly apologize.
I'll go see.

01:24:54.590 --> 01:24:57.134
At least read this letter!

01:24:57.259 --> 01:24:58.552
What's going on?

01:24:59.261 --> 01:25:03.307
Pay us our fee for
the jeweled branch we made!

01:25:03.432 --> 01:25:04.475
What?!

01:25:05.476 --> 01:25:06.644
"Made"?

01:25:08.270 --> 01:25:13.818
I am Ayabe no Uchimaro,
of the Guild of Artisans.

01:25:14.777 --> 01:25:19.740
Prince Kuramochi had us
mount gems...

01:25:19.990 --> 01:25:23.202
... and fashion them into
a jeweled branch.

01:25:23.494 --> 01:25:24.662
What?

01:25:24.954 --> 01:25:28.165
The Prince, however,
has not yet paid us.

01:25:28.290 --> 01:25:29.583
He hasn't?

01:25:30.793 --> 01:25:31.585
Oh, dear!

01:25:31.710 --> 01:25:36.006
And since Princess Kaguya,
one of his concubines...

01:25:36.132 --> 01:25:40.845
... sorry, his <i>wife,</i>
was here in this house...

01:25:41.137 --> 01:25:43.639
... we had no choice...

01:25:43.806 --> 01:25:48.185
... but to come here
and ask her for payment.

01:25:52.148 --> 01:25:53.858
I see.

01:25:54.650 --> 01:25:57.027
Your Highness, what is the...

01:25:58.779 --> 01:26:01.532
Your Highness?
Where did he go?!

01:26:02.658 --> 01:26:04.034
Where's the branch?

01:26:04.326 --> 01:26:07.204
His Highness has taken his leave.

01:26:07.329 --> 01:26:08.706
What?!

01:26:15.588 --> 01:26:20.551
Please reward the artisans
very well.

01:26:25.848 --> 01:26:26.724
There!

01:26:28.350 --> 01:26:33.564
<i>Next to call at the mansion
was Abe, Minister of the Right.</i>

01:26:43.866 --> 01:26:45.409
Look!

01:26:45.534 --> 01:26:48.370
See how it glistens!

01:26:50.539 --> 01:26:56.587
The world has never seen
such an expensive engagement gift.

01:26:57.046 --> 01:27:00.841
But if it should please
Princess Kaguya...

01:27:00.966 --> 01:27:04.011
... it is a mere trifle.

01:27:05.721 --> 01:27:06.764
In that case...

01:27:06.889 --> 01:27:09.266
Ah, you're right here?

01:27:09.391 --> 01:27:11.143
Put it into a fire.

01:27:11.310 --> 01:27:12.102
Huh?

01:27:13.312 --> 01:27:14.772
What?

01:27:16.065 --> 01:27:18.776
If it is truly the fur
of the fire-rat...

01:27:19.235 --> 01:27:23.781
... it will not burn,
but merely glisten all the brighter.

01:27:23.906 --> 01:27:25.616
Of course!

01:27:25.741 --> 01:27:29.119
This robe is the genuine article!

01:27:29.245 --> 01:27:31.956
Placed in the fire, it will not burn.

01:27:32.581 --> 01:27:35.793
Or at least, it "should not" burn.

01:27:35.918 --> 01:27:40.047
Unless of course between myself
and the princess...

01:27:40.172 --> 01:27:44.635
... there remains
some unwarranted impurity.

01:27:44.760 --> 01:27:46.470
Yes, indeed.

01:27:46.595 --> 01:27:49.640
All the more reason to test it.

01:27:49.765 --> 01:27:54.436
Burn away all the impurity
of my doubts.

01:27:57.773 --> 01:27:59.441
Oh, all right!

01:28:40.482 --> 01:28:42.359
What did I tell you?

01:28:42.484 --> 01:28:43.861
You see?

01:28:53.829 --> 01:28:55.039
Ow!

01:28:59.001 --> 01:29:01.879
My fortune is burning!

01:29:11.930 --> 01:29:15.559
I've lost everything!

01:29:24.193 --> 01:29:27.071
Do you realize how much this cost?!

01:29:27.196 --> 01:29:30.240
Look at it, will you!

01:29:30.366 --> 01:29:33.243
"Burn it," she says!

01:29:35.704 --> 01:29:37.581
How infuriating!

01:29:45.047 --> 01:29:51.095
I wonder how much
the Minister spent on that fake.

01:29:51.220 --> 01:29:54.640
I assume that is what I am
to those gentlemen.

01:29:55.557 --> 01:30:00.104
A fake jeweled branch,
or a rat-fur robe that burns.

01:30:01.730 --> 01:30:05.109
Both those objects
were very expensive.

01:30:05.567 --> 01:30:07.778
But don't worry.

01:30:07.903 --> 01:30:11.865
Grand Counselor Otomo
has indeed put to sea...

01:30:11.990 --> 01:30:16.537
... in quest of the gem
hanging from the dragon's neck.

01:30:17.246 --> 01:30:21.792
They say in order to marry you...

01:30:21.917 --> 01:30:24.294
... he has sent his wife away...

01:30:24.420 --> 01:30:27.798
... and completely rebuilt his mansion.

01:30:28.590 --> 01:30:32.302
A warrior's resolve
is a wondrous thing.

01:30:36.932 --> 01:30:39.685
All right, Dragon! Have at me!

01:30:44.648 --> 01:30:46.024
Careful!

01:31:09.840 --> 01:31:11.550
The Dragon!

01:31:12.509 --> 01:31:16.054
Forgive me! Forgive me!

01:31:28.025 --> 01:31:30.235
Another one!

01:31:32.196 --> 01:31:33.655
Help me!

01:31:33.822 --> 01:31:37.409
Calm down!
The storm will blow itself out.

01:31:47.419 --> 01:31:54.051
<i>About that time, Prince Ishitsukuri
was paying a call on Princess Kaguya.</i>

01:32:13.904 --> 01:32:20.035
Well, Your Highness,
is this Lord Buddha's stone bowl?

01:32:20.244 --> 01:32:22.454
Give this to her.

01:32:22.579 --> 01:32:25.123
What is it exactly?

01:32:25.249 --> 01:32:27.292
Give it to her, please.

01:32:27.417 --> 01:32:30.462
Yes, but...

01:32:36.093 --> 01:32:40.806
Your Highness,
this is from Prince Ishitsukuri.

01:32:56.280 --> 01:32:59.825
Since I first heard your voice
three years ago...

01:32:59.950 --> 01:33:02.953
... you have been constantly
on my mind.

01:33:03.453 --> 01:33:08.166
Desperately I searched for
"Buddha's stone begging bowl".

01:33:08.834 --> 01:33:13.338
I crossed meadow and mountain,
visiting every temple in the land.

01:33:14.131 --> 01:33:18.844
Eventually, weary as could be,
I sat on a rock by the roadside.

01:33:19.970 --> 01:33:25.684
Suddenly my eye fell upon
a wildflower there at my feet.

01:33:26.310 --> 01:33:31.857
Ah! My feelings for you
bloomed unknown, I thought...

01:33:31.982 --> 01:33:34.693
... just like that flower.

01:33:35.652 --> 01:33:40.198
Suddenly the realization dawned...

01:33:40.991 --> 01:33:43.869
... that what I wanted to give you...

01:33:43.994 --> 01:33:47.539
... and you wanted to receive...

01:33:47.831 --> 01:33:52.044
... was not some unattainable treasure,
but that flower.

01:33:52.336 --> 01:33:57.382
In other words,
the symbol of my devotion to you.

01:33:58.175 --> 01:33:59.551
"Devotion"...

01:34:00.677 --> 01:34:03.805
Princess Kaguya!
You are the one...

01:34:03.972 --> 01:34:07.392
... to whom I would give my heart.

01:34:07.809 --> 01:34:11.897
Would you accept
that lovely flower...

01:34:12.022 --> 01:34:14.232
... and my devotion?

01:34:17.027 --> 01:34:20.405
I have always loved plants.

01:34:20.530 --> 01:34:26.244
I am entranced by the nameless flowers
that grow by the roadside.

01:34:26.870 --> 01:34:29.581
And I always wish...

01:34:29.873 --> 01:34:33.877
... I could live as one of those
flowers of the field.

01:34:39.716 --> 01:34:45.263
Princess, come with me
to some place that is not this one.

01:34:46.014 --> 01:34:49.643
Let us leave the capital
and its formalities...

01:34:50.227 --> 01:34:54.940
... for a rich green land of flowers,
birds, and leaping fish.

01:34:55.399 --> 01:34:57.275
Somewhere not here.

01:34:59.069 --> 01:35:04.449
We will laugh, sing, and sleep
to our hearts' content.

01:35:04.950 --> 01:35:08.620
Morning to night,
the seasons meeting our needs...

01:35:08.745 --> 01:35:11.790
... let us spin a beautiful tale.

01:35:13.417 --> 01:35:17.796
Come with me
to somewhere that is not here!

01:35:18.255 --> 01:35:24.302
A land of green where flowers bloom,
birds sing, and fish dance!

01:35:24.428 --> 01:35:26.972
Somewhere that is not here!

01:35:38.358 --> 01:35:39.651
What?!

01:35:40.777 --> 01:35:44.156
"Somewhere that is not here"?

01:35:44.448 --> 01:35:49.077
I would very much like
to be taken there again.

01:35:49.202 --> 01:35:51.329
I'm sorry!

01:35:51.455 --> 01:35:53.498
Forgive me!

01:35:57.085 --> 01:35:59.838
How many flowers...

01:35:59.963 --> 01:36:05.010
... have you plucked
and thrown away...

01:36:05.135 --> 01:36:09.139
... leaving them
to shave their heads in despair...

01:36:09.264 --> 01:36:12.684
... and become nuns?

01:36:17.063 --> 01:36:18.857
I've found one!

01:36:20.150 --> 01:36:21.526
Get me down!

01:36:21.860 --> 01:36:22.986
<i>Remaining now...</i>

01:36:23.153 --> 01:36:28.700
<i>... was Middle Counselor Isonokami,
and the swallow's cowry shell.</i>

01:36:31.661 --> 01:36:32.996
Counselor!

01:36:41.671 --> 01:36:43.089
He's dead?!

01:36:43.215 --> 01:36:44.049
Yes.

01:36:44.174 --> 01:36:48.720
The fall broke
the Middle Counselor's back.

01:37:14.371 --> 01:37:15.831
What's wrong?

01:37:16.873 --> 01:37:19.835
This garden! It's a fake!

01:37:21.837 --> 01:37:22.629
Fake!

01:37:23.380 --> 01:37:24.422
Fake!

01:37:24.673 --> 01:37:25.757
Fake!

01:37:26.216 --> 01:37:27.592
Fake!

01:37:27.717 --> 01:37:29.261
All of it! Fake!

01:37:29.553 --> 01:37:32.430
And so am I!

01:37:32.722 --> 01:37:33.807
Stop it.

01:37:42.899 --> 01:37:45.944
It's my fault everyone's miserable.

01:37:46.570 --> 01:37:50.115
It's not your fault. It's not.

01:37:50.699 --> 01:37:53.785
It <i>is</i> my fault.

01:37:54.578 --> 01:37:56.621
Because I'm a fake!

01:37:57.581 --> 01:37:58.456
Princess!

01:37:58.582 --> 01:38:02.627
I never dreamed
things would turn out like this!

01:38:02.752 --> 01:38:03.962
Of course not.

01:38:04.713 --> 01:38:07.632
But it's not your fault.

01:38:18.184 --> 01:38:24.107
<i>Now, in spite of her wishes,
there was even more talk of her.</i>

01:38:24.232 --> 01:38:28.320
<i>His Majesty himself
became interested.</i>

01:38:30.947 --> 01:38:34.659
She has toyed with
five of the greatest nobles.

01:38:35.285 --> 01:38:36.536
Fascinating.

01:38:36.953 --> 01:38:38.997
That must mean...

01:38:39.122 --> 01:38:44.502
... this "Princess Kaguya"
wishes to come to me.

01:38:46.379 --> 01:38:50.008
Send word that she is to come
and serve at court.

01:38:50.133 --> 01:38:51.593
Yes, Sire.

01:38:51.968 --> 01:38:56.681
If she comes, I'll give her father,
Sanuki no Miyatsuko...

01:38:56.806 --> 01:38:58.892
... a court rank!

01:38:59.309 --> 01:39:00.852
Yes, Sire.

01:39:01.645 --> 01:39:03.438
Thanks be to Heaven!

01:39:03.647 --> 01:39:05.690
Your Highness!

01:39:05.815 --> 01:39:07.525
Please! No more of this!

01:39:07.651 --> 01:39:09.027
Your Highness!

01:39:11.821 --> 01:39:15.033
Your Highness! Rejoice!

01:39:15.575 --> 01:39:20.205
His Majesty summons you
to serve him at court!

01:39:20.997 --> 01:39:24.042
You'll be one of his ladies.

01:39:24.167 --> 01:39:26.795
And I'll wear a courtier's cap!

01:39:26.920 --> 01:39:29.214
Thanks be to Heaven!

01:39:29.339 --> 01:39:32.384
You still don't understand
how she feels?

01:39:32.509 --> 01:39:34.344
<i>You</i> don't understand!

01:39:34.511 --> 01:39:37.138
This is what I've worked for!

01:39:37.263 --> 01:39:39.057
A court lady!

01:39:39.182 --> 01:39:43.228
There is no greater happiness
for a girl in this land!

01:39:44.104 --> 01:39:47.899
At last the princess will be happy!

01:39:48.024 --> 01:39:49.401
Father...

01:39:49.693 --> 01:39:52.737
... I'm sorry, but please refuse.

01:39:53.530 --> 01:39:55.907
I couldn't be His Majesty's now.

01:39:56.533 --> 01:40:00.412
What?! This is for your sake...

01:40:00.537 --> 01:40:02.247
Tell him no.

01:40:03.206 --> 01:40:04.582
But...

01:40:04.749 --> 01:40:09.421
... no one in this land may disobey
an order from His Majesty!

01:40:09.546 --> 01:40:12.632
Now, please!
Don't be so contrary!

01:40:14.050 --> 01:40:18.596
If you wish to accuse me...

01:40:18.888 --> 01:40:21.933
... of disobedience to His Majesty...

01:40:23.226 --> 01:40:26.730
... then feel free to kill me.

01:40:27.063 --> 01:40:28.106
Princess!

01:40:28.231 --> 01:40:34.946
If your happiness depends
on a courtier's cap...

01:40:35.697 --> 01:40:38.450
... then I will go to him.

01:40:39.242 --> 01:40:44.289
When I see you wearing that cap,
then I will kill myself.

01:40:58.053 --> 01:41:01.306
What? She refuses?

01:41:01.765 --> 01:41:03.475
What can this mean?

01:41:03.725 --> 01:41:08.271
I never dreamed a woman
would ever turn me down.

01:41:10.440 --> 01:41:14.486
Fascinating.
I wish to meet her all the more.

01:41:15.111 --> 01:41:20.617
In that case, I'll pay a quiet visit
to the Miyatsuko mansion.

01:41:21.618 --> 01:41:22.994
Yes, Sire.

01:41:40.136 --> 01:41:42.180
This way, please.

01:41:46.810 --> 01:41:49.270
She plays wonderfully.

01:42:10.834 --> 01:42:13.044
How beautiful!

01:42:25.348 --> 01:42:29.060
Come with me to the palace.

01:42:29.185 --> 01:42:31.271
Why are you doing this?!

01:42:31.437 --> 01:42:35.066
No woman is unhappy
when I do this.

01:42:35.191 --> 01:42:37.735
I will never be yours!

01:42:37.861 --> 01:42:43.074
You must be, if I wish it.

01:42:44.033 --> 01:42:46.077
Bring the palanquin!

01:42:52.041 --> 01:42:53.084
What?

01:42:53.543 --> 01:42:54.752
Where are you?

01:43:01.050 --> 01:43:02.427
Where did you go?

01:43:22.405 --> 01:43:27.952
I apologize for acting in haste.
Please show yourself.

01:43:29.245 --> 01:43:30.288
Please.

01:43:31.080 --> 01:43:34.959
I will burn the sight of you
into my eyes and leave.

01:43:44.928 --> 01:43:46.804
How beautiful!

01:43:49.933 --> 01:43:51.601
Forgive me.

01:43:56.773 --> 01:43:58.650
I will withdraw.

01:43:58.942 --> 01:44:02.070
But I still believe...

01:44:02.278 --> 01:44:05.323
... your happiness lies in being mine.

01:44:07.700 --> 01:44:09.827
Beautiful!

01:44:38.481 --> 01:44:41.234
<i>His Majesty returned to his palace.</i>

01:44:42.026 --> 01:44:46.197
<i>Now, every night
that the moon was out...</i>

01:44:46.322 --> 01:44:49.367
<i>... the princess would gaze up at it.</i>

01:45:10.013 --> 01:45:11.764
What's wrong?

01:45:12.515 --> 01:45:15.560
Lately you don't come to see me.

01:45:16.853 --> 01:45:22.233
You've left your spinning to sit,
and your garden to grow wild.

01:45:22.525 --> 01:45:25.570
You sit every night
and gaze at the moon.

01:45:25.695 --> 01:45:28.406
What's the matter?

01:45:28.698 --> 01:45:30.074
Nothing.

01:45:30.199 --> 01:45:33.077
It's something.

01:45:33.369 --> 01:45:36.581
I can tell by the look in your eyes.

01:45:37.373 --> 01:45:39.709
There's really nothing wrong.

01:45:39.876 --> 01:45:41.753
That's not true.

01:45:49.177 --> 01:45:52.263
Can't you tell even me?

01:45:58.728 --> 01:46:01.939
I don't want to go back
to the Moon!

01:46:02.899 --> 01:46:04.108
"Go back"?

01:46:04.901 --> 01:46:06.110
"To the Moon"?

01:46:06.235 --> 01:46:10.615
I've begged them to let me stay!

01:46:10.740 --> 01:46:13.284
Here! In this land!

01:46:14.077 --> 01:46:18.206
But they're coming for me
on the 15th night!

01:46:18.581 --> 01:46:19.957
Coming for you?

01:46:21.417 --> 01:46:24.629
I don't understand.

01:46:25.338 --> 01:46:26.964
Your Highness...

01:46:27.298 --> 01:46:31.803
... tell me something
that makes sense.

01:46:33.221 --> 01:46:37.475
You poor thing!
This is serious, isn't it.

01:46:50.780 --> 01:46:54.992
I am one who was sent down here
from the Moon.

01:46:55.118 --> 01:46:56.661
The Moon?!

01:46:59.455 --> 01:47:01.666
So that's what it was!

01:47:01.791 --> 01:47:02.834
Yes.

01:47:04.043 --> 01:47:08.840
I only realized that
when His Majesty came.

01:47:09.590 --> 01:47:15.513
And now on the 15th
I must leave you...

01:47:16.097 --> 01:47:18.057
... and go back.

01:47:18.975 --> 01:47:22.687
To the Moon? And leave us?

01:47:23.980 --> 01:47:26.357
What have we done
to deserve this?

01:47:26.816 --> 01:47:31.487
Everything we've done has been
for your happiness!

01:47:32.321 --> 01:47:37.493
That happiness you wished for me
was hard to bear.

01:47:38.661 --> 01:47:40.496
Without realizing it...

01:47:40.788 --> 01:47:43.541
... I prayed to the Moon to save me.

01:47:44.167 --> 01:47:48.880
When His Majesty embraced me,
my heart screamed out...

01:47:49.338 --> 01:47:52.049
... "I don't want to be here!"

01:47:53.342 --> 01:47:58.055
You deliberately called them
to take you back?

01:47:58.514 --> 01:48:01.726
How could you!

01:48:01.851 --> 01:48:04.520
What have you done?!

01:48:04.729 --> 01:48:07.940
But I don't want to go.
Not like this!

01:48:08.065 --> 01:48:09.901
Then why not just stay?

01:48:10.026 --> 01:48:13.571
Fine! Even if they come
to take you...

01:48:13.696 --> 01:48:15.406
... I won't let them!

01:48:15.531 --> 01:48:17.074
It's too late...

01:48:17.200 --> 01:48:18.576
... for everything!

01:48:20.369 --> 01:48:24.916
What have I been doing down here?!

01:48:25.708 --> 01:48:29.086
Throwing tantrums about
belonging to someone...

01:48:29.212 --> 01:48:31.589
... ignoring your wishes...

01:48:31.714 --> 01:48:36.052
... and fooling myself with
fake meadows and mountains!

01:48:38.221 --> 01:48:45.770
But now that I have to leave
I finally remember...

01:48:47.605 --> 01:48:52.777
... why I came down to this place...

01:48:53.694 --> 01:49:00.952
... and why, in this strange land,
I'd always known that song.

01:49:02.578 --> 01:49:08.960
"Birds, bugs, beasts"...

01:49:09.126 --> 01:49:11.963
That's right.

01:49:12.463 --> 01:49:18.970
I was born to truly live!
Just like the birds and the beasts.

01:49:23.933 --> 01:49:25.643
I don't want to leave!

01:49:26.394 --> 01:49:29.897
Do you think I'd let you go?!

01:49:30.273 --> 01:49:34.819
From the day I took you
out of that bamboo stalk...

01:49:35.278 --> 01:49:38.990
... I've loved you
as if you were my own child!

01:49:41.450 --> 01:49:47.331
When I held you, changed you,
set you on your feet...

01:49:47.623 --> 01:49:51.502
... I was as happy as if
I were in Heaven!

01:49:57.466 --> 01:49:59.677
It's not too late!

01:49:59.802 --> 01:50:02.930
You're still here!

01:50:03.055 --> 01:50:06.183
Here in my arms!

01:50:07.268 --> 01:50:08.936
We'll drive them away!

01:50:09.729 --> 01:50:13.357
No matter how many come for you!

01:50:14.150 --> 01:50:15.693
Is anyone here?!

01:50:16.152 --> 01:50:19.113
Prepare to defend the princess!

01:50:22.491 --> 01:50:25.369
I'm sorry, Father.

01:50:37.298 --> 01:50:39.842
What a lot of noise!

01:50:43.137 --> 01:50:45.681
Let's sing to keep up our spirits.

01:50:55.274 --> 01:50:59.195
Round, round, go round

01:50:59.320 --> 01:51:03.032
Waterwheel, go round

01:51:03.240 --> 01:51:06.869
Go round, and call Mr Sun

01:51:07.203 --> 01:51:11.207
Go round, and call Mr Sun

01:51:11.332 --> 01:51:15.211
Birds, bugs, beasts

01:51:15.419 --> 01:51:19.048
Grass, trees, flowers

01:51:19.340 --> 01:51:23.052
Bring spring and summer,
fall and winter

01:51:23.344 --> 01:51:27.390
Bring spring and summer,
fall and winter

01:51:29.684 --> 01:51:35.398
Go round, come round,
come round

01:51:35.523 --> 01:51:40.903
Come round, O distant time

01:51:41.195 --> 01:51:46.575
Come round,
call back my heart

01:51:46.826 --> 01:51:52.081
Come round,
call back my heart

01:51:52.373 --> 01:51:57.586
Birds, bugs, beasts

01:51:58.045 --> 01:52:02.633
Grass, trees, flowers

01:52:03.551 --> 01:52:09.265
Teach me how to feel

01:52:12.059 --> 01:52:17.690
If I hear that you pine for me

01:52:17.982 --> 01:52:25.781
I will return to you

01:52:29.744 --> 01:52:32.288
There's another verse to that song?

01:52:33.038 --> 01:52:34.290
Long ago...

01:52:34.415 --> 01:52:40.129
... someone who'd come back from here
used to sing it on the Moon.

01:52:42.256 --> 01:52:47.136
When you put on the robe of the Moon,
you lose all memory of this place.

01:52:47.428 --> 01:52:49.805
All grief and sadness are gone.

01:52:50.765 --> 01:52:56.812
But when she sang that song,
tears would come to her eyes.

01:52:59.607 --> 01:53:05.154
And for some reason, that magic
took my heart, too.

01:53:06.614 --> 01:53:10.659
And now I understand
exactly how she felt.

01:53:11.744 --> 01:53:14.997
And why I yearned for here,
and broke the rules...

01:53:15.289 --> 01:53:18.793
... and maybe why
I was sent down here.

01:53:19.543 --> 01:53:20.669
Princess!

01:53:21.462 --> 01:53:23.005
She wanted...

01:53:23.130 --> 01:53:29.178
... to come back here.
I'm sure of it!

01:53:31.138 --> 01:53:35.684
"If I hear that you pine for me,
I will return to you."

01:53:36.977 --> 01:53:40.314
"If you are truly waiting for me...

01:53:40.606 --> 01:53:43.859
"... I will come straight back."

01:53:43.984 --> 01:53:48.197
I want to go home! Right now!

01:53:53.994 --> 01:53:57.832
Prepare a carriage, please.
Don't tell anyone.

01:54:46.964 --> 01:54:48.757
All these ginger flowers!

01:55:15.576 --> 01:55:17.620
It's been a long time.

01:55:17.745 --> 01:55:18.662
Num-nums!

01:55:18.787 --> 01:55:20.956
What, are you hungry?

01:55:29.256 --> 01:55:30.799
Did you hear that?

01:55:32.426 --> 01:55:33.677
Nope.

01:55:34.261 --> 01:55:35.638
I'll go on ahead.

01:55:57.284 --> 01:55:59.161
Sutemaru?

01:55:59.453 --> 01:56:00.287
Is that you?

01:56:00.621 --> 01:56:01.997
Li'l Bamboo?

01:56:02.456 --> 01:56:03.999
Can I call you that?

01:56:09.797 --> 01:56:12.341
We're just getting back here.

01:56:12.466 --> 01:56:16.178
Coming over the pass,
I thought I heard you singing.

01:56:16.303 --> 01:56:18.180
I'm so glad to see you!

01:56:20.307 --> 01:56:22.184
Uh, yeah.

01:56:23.978 --> 01:56:26.855
But why are you here,
and dressed like that?

01:56:26.981 --> 01:56:30.025
All this time
I've wanted to come home.

01:56:30.985 --> 01:56:32.695
"Home"?

01:56:33.821 --> 01:56:34.738
Here?

01:56:34.863 --> 01:56:36.031
Yes.

01:56:37.825 --> 01:56:40.077
Didn't you like the capital?

01:56:41.537 --> 01:56:46.875
You had nice clothes, a mansion,
fine food...

01:56:47.001 --> 01:56:51.588
All the time I was thinking about
how we all used to play here.

01:56:51.714 --> 01:56:54.466
They'll all be here soon.

01:56:54.675 --> 01:56:56.885
With you, Sutemaru...

01:57:00.848 --> 01:57:05.853
With you, Sutemaru,
I might have been happy.

01:57:07.104 --> 01:57:08.647
With me?

01:57:09.356 --> 01:57:11.233
Now I realize that.

01:57:13.193 --> 01:57:14.236
Yeah, right!

01:57:15.362 --> 01:57:18.073
You couldn't live like we do.

01:57:18.198 --> 01:57:21.744
Sure I could!
I did when we were kids.

01:57:32.046 --> 01:57:33.255
In these clothes?

01:57:34.214 --> 01:57:36.425
Half-starving, eating roots?

01:57:38.177 --> 01:57:40.763
Sometimes having to steal?

01:57:40.888 --> 01:57:42.431
I saw that!

01:57:44.391 --> 01:57:47.102
I got you beaten up.

01:57:47.227 --> 01:57:48.687
That was nothing.

01:57:48.854 --> 01:57:53.442
You're right! As long as you can
answer back by being alive.

01:57:56.236 --> 01:57:58.781
I'm sure I would have been happy.

01:58:03.744 --> 01:58:04.953
Li'l Bamboo!

01:58:06.747 --> 01:58:08.207
But it won't happen.

01:58:09.124 --> 01:58:10.626
It's too late.

01:58:10.876 --> 01:58:12.127
Too late?

01:58:14.421 --> 01:58:16.298
His Majesty?

01:58:16.423 --> 01:58:17.466
No!

01:58:17.716 --> 01:58:19.384
No one will own me!

01:58:19.510 --> 01:58:20.302
Well, then...

01:58:20.469 --> 01:58:21.303
It won't happen.

01:58:21.428 --> 01:58:23.472
Why not? We could start now.

01:58:25.432 --> 01:58:26.642
Let's run away.

01:58:26.767 --> 01:58:27.851
Right now!

01:58:28.102 --> 01:58:30.312
I'll carry you on my back.

01:58:30.521 --> 01:58:33.649
We'll go far away,
where no one knows us.

01:58:34.441 --> 01:58:36.985
I can't run away now.

01:58:37.277 --> 01:58:38.737
Sure you can!

01:58:39.029 --> 01:58:41.490
If they find us, I'll protect you!

01:58:41.615 --> 01:58:43.492
They've already found me.

01:58:43.784 --> 01:58:45.327
What do you mean?

01:58:46.286 --> 01:58:47.830
I've been found.

01:58:50.124 --> 01:58:51.583
So you've been found.

01:58:52.459 --> 01:58:53.585
So what?!

01:58:53.836 --> 01:58:55.045
Who cares?

01:58:55.170 --> 01:58:56.588
I want us to run away!

01:59:00.467 --> 01:59:01.426
Come on!

01:59:03.470 --> 01:59:04.721
Sutemaru!

01:59:06.140 --> 01:59:07.224
Right!

01:59:10.811 --> 01:59:13.522
I'll run, too! As fast as I can!

01:59:35.002 --> 01:59:36.378
Li'l Bamboo!

01:59:36.837 --> 01:59:37.713
Li'l Bamboo!

01:59:37.838 --> 01:59:39.381
Sutemaru!

02:00:06.200 --> 02:00:09.745
O heaven and earth!
Take me in!

02:01:37.457 --> 02:01:38.542
Please!

02:01:38.667 --> 02:01:41.003
Let me stay a little longer!

02:01:41.712 --> 02:01:46.174
Just a little longer, to feel
the joy of living in this place!

02:01:46.383 --> 02:01:47.676
What do you mean?

02:01:47.801 --> 02:01:49.511
I'm holding you!

02:01:49.761 --> 02:01:52.848
Hold me tighter! Don't let me go!

02:01:56.977 --> 02:01:58.186
Li'l Bamboo!

02:01:59.479 --> 02:02:00.647
Li'l Bamboo!

02:02:18.665 --> 02:02:20.042
Li'l Bamboo!

02:02:21.501 --> 02:02:22.711
Li'l Bamboo!

02:02:25.339 --> 02:02:26.548
A dream?

02:02:30.677 --> 02:02:32.220
I dreamed that?

02:02:34.848 --> 02:02:36.725
Poppa!

02:02:37.351 --> 02:02:39.061
Poppa!

02:02:54.368 --> 02:02:55.744
Poppa!

02:03:12.010 --> 02:03:17.015
<i>Now, at last,
August 15th came round.</i>

02:04:03.603 --> 02:04:04.771
Loose arrows!

02:04:39.264 --> 02:04:40.182
Princess!

02:04:40.599 --> 02:04:41.808
Princess!

02:04:43.101 --> 02:04:45.312
Princess!

02:04:45.437 --> 02:04:47.814
Princess!

02:04:48.231 --> 02:04:49.316
Princess!

02:05:19.304 --> 02:05:20.055
Princess...

02:06:35.672 --> 02:06:38.633
Birds, bugs, beasts

02:06:39.467 --> 02:06:43.263
Grass, trees, flowers

02:06:43.597 --> 02:06:47.267
Flower, bear fruit, and die

02:06:47.601 --> 02:06:51.271
Be born, grow up, and die

02:06:51.396 --> 02:06:55.191
Still the wind blows, the rain falls

02:06:55.400 --> 02:06:59.112
The waterwheel goes round

02:06:59.487 --> 02:07:03.116
Lifetimes come and go in turn

02:07:03.575 --> 02:07:07.621
Lifetimes come and go in turn

02:07:08.580 --> 02:07:09.956
Princess!

02:07:10.415 --> 02:07:15.670
Lifetimes come and go in turn

02:07:19.215 --> 02:07:21.968
Princess! Don't go!

02:07:22.427 --> 02:07:23.637
Wait!

02:07:24.262 --> 02:07:25.639
Please, wait.

02:07:26.931 --> 02:07:28.933
Once I don this robe...

02:07:29.267 --> 02:07:32.979
... I will forget everything
about this place.

02:07:33.355 --> 02:07:35.482
Give me a little more time.

02:07:38.276 --> 02:07:39.486
Princess!

02:07:44.282 --> 02:07:46.159
Momma! Poppa!

02:07:48.453 --> 02:07:49.496
Princess!

02:07:49.621 --> 02:07:52.123
Take us with you!

02:07:53.291 --> 02:07:56.127
Poppa, Momma... forgive me!

02:07:57.128 --> 02:07:59.172
Come along.

02:07:59.297 --> 02:08:02.342
In the purity of
the City of the Moon...

02:08:02.467 --> 02:08:07.347
... leave behind
this world's sorrow and uncleanness.

02:08:07.472 --> 02:08:08.848
It's not unclean!

02:08:11.810 --> 02:08:13.728
There's joy, there's grief...

02:08:13.853 --> 02:08:17.357
All who live here feel them
in all their different shades!

02:08:17.982 --> 02:08:20.360
There's birds, bugs, beasts...

02:08:20.485 --> 02:08:22.028
... grass, trees, flowers...

02:08:22.320 --> 02:08:24.197
... and feelings.

02:08:27.409 --> 02:08:28.702
Princess!

02:08:40.505 --> 02:08:42.382
Princess!

02:09:05.029 --> 02:09:06.239
Princess!

02:09:35.393 --> 02:09:39.272
Forgive me!

02:11:34.846 --> 02:11:41.561
<i>The joy I felt when I touched you</i>

02:11:41.811 --> 02:11:48.067
<i>Went deep, deep down</i>

02:11:49.360 --> 02:11:57.076
<i>And seeped into</i>

02:11:57.368 --> 02:12:03.082
<i>Every nook and cranny of this body</i>

02:12:04.292 --> 02:12:10.757
<i>Even if I'm far away</i>

02:12:12.050 --> 02:12:19.766
<i>And no longer understand anything</i>

02:12:20.725 --> 02:12:27.106
<i>Even when the time comes</i>

02:12:27.565 --> 02:12:34.948
<i>For this life to end</i>

02:12:36.366 --> 02:12:42.121
<i>Everything of now</i>

02:12:43.957 --> 02:12:50.630
<i>Is everything of the past</i>

02:12:51.589 --> 02:12:58.471
<i>We'll meet again, I'm sure</i>

02:12:58.930 --> 02:13:05.478
<i>In some nostalgic place</i>

02:13:38.469 --> 02:13:45.351
<i>The warmth you gave me</i>

02:13:45.643 --> 02:13:52.025
<i>Deep, deep down</i>

02:13:53.484 --> 02:14:01.200
<i>Comes to me now, complete</i>

02:14:01.659 --> 02:14:06.706
<i>From a time long past</i>

02:14:08.332 --> 02:14:15.548
<i>Steadily in my heart</i>

02:14:16.174 --> 02:14:24.057
<i>The flames of passion give light</i>

02:14:24.682 --> 02:14:31.397
<i>And softly soothe my pain</i>

02:14:31.689 --> 02:14:39.072
<i>Down to the depths of my grief</i>

02:14:40.531 --> 02:14:46.913
<i>Everything now</i>

02:14:47.747 --> 02:14:54.253
<i>Is hope for the future</i>

02:14:55.046 --> 02:15:01.594
<i>I'll remember, I'm sure</i>

02:15:01.886 --> 02:15:10.269
