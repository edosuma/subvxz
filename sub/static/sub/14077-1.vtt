00:14.786 --> 00:16.049
Gabby!

00:17.753 --> 00:19.837
Wake up!

01:02.726 --> 01:07.258
Do you feel it... how close you are?

01:12.432 --> 01:16.151
Feel how alive your heart is.

01:18.137 --> 01:22.655
You ever wonder how much
a human heart can take?

01:39.587 --> 01:40.938
Mommy?

02:22.318 --> 02:25.940
Come on, man. What are you doing?
Give me that. Give me that. Come on.

02:29.327 --> 02:32.029
There's more news on the Night Stalker.

02:32.129 --> 02:34.814
I'm so sorry for your loss.

02:36.699 --> 02:39.469
They got him. They got him.

02:39.569 --> 02:43.355
There was a car chase, shoot out.

02:44.873 --> 02:46.546
What about the house?

02:46.646 --> 02:50.112
It's all boarded up,
it's a crime scene for God's sake.

02:50.212 --> 02:52.232
Did you go in?

02:52.332 --> 02:54.530
No, I mean...

02:54.630 --> 02:58.438
I snuck through the grounds but I couldn't.
It was all sealed up.

02:59.451 --> 03:02.387
We've got to find out
what happened to our machine.

03:02.487 --> 03:06.691
It's still there. It's still there. The police
probably didn't know what to make of it.

03:06.791 --> 03:09.094
We have to go back.

03:09.594 --> 03:11.095
What?

03:11.195 --> 03:15.564
No, no, there's patrol cars there
every night, we can't go back.

03:15.664 --> 03:18.367
We have to get the machine up and running!

03:18.467 --> 03:21.404
No, your wife and daughter
just died in that place.

03:21.504 --> 03:23.839
That's exactly why we have to go back!

03:23.939 --> 03:27.507
Neil, we built the machine
to capture ghosts, alright?

03:27.607 --> 03:31.745
If there was ever a reason to use
that goddamned machine, now is the time!

03:31.845 --> 03:36.302
I don't want their spirits flying around
in that house for a second longer!

03:47.123 --> 03:49.192
Yeah, I got the call from him too.

03:49.292 --> 03:51.801
<i>You on your way there now?</i>

03:51.901 --> 03:54.996
We've been driving about an hour.
Has Henry said how he's doing?

03:55.096 --> 03:58.782
<i>I think it's too early for him
to let it all sink in.</i>

03:59.100 --> 04:02.436
<i>He's dealing with it the only way he can.</i>

04:03.036 --> 04:06.207
Yeah. That's why I'm coming.

04:06.757 --> 04:10.325
- Alright, I'll see you soon.
- <i>See you soon.</i>

04:10.425 --> 04:13.243
We should be getting there
around nightfall.

04:15.314 --> 04:18.482
I'm just glad you're finally
letting me come along.

04:18.582 --> 04:23.269
I know you've been busy with your work,
but I think I can really be help.

04:23.369 --> 04:25.254
Yeah.

04:26.455 --> 04:29.490
I just want to make sure
that you give Henry his space.

04:29.590 --> 04:34.662
Just observe. Everything is really
sensitive now with this situation.

04:34.762 --> 04:38.335
Hey. I can be compassionate too.

05:06.287 --> 05:08.122
Hi.

05:08.222 --> 05:10.072
Neil.

05:12.192 --> 05:14.929
- How you holding up?
- Good.

05:15.029 --> 05:16.997
I'm glad you're here.

05:17.097 --> 05:21.616
- Seen Henry yet?
- Not since I called him.

05:21.733 --> 05:24.970
Henry's dealing with it as Henry does.

05:25.550 --> 05:27.955
And who's this?

05:28.538 --> 05:31.540
Neil, this is Devon. Devon, Neil.

05:31.640 --> 05:35.945
- The Devon. I've heard so much about you.
- Nice to meet you.

05:36.045 --> 05:39.239
And this is my girlfriend, Amy.
Jessica, Devon.

05:39.339 --> 05:42.884
Hey. It's so nice to finally meet you.

05:43.484 --> 05:47.805
It's okay, guys, I checked inside,
it's clean and... Who's this?

05:49.118 --> 05:53.108
Henry, this is my girlfriend, Amy.
You remember the reporter that I met?

05:54.125 --> 05:59.197
Neil... this is no time to turn this
into some sort of a media circus.

05:59.297 --> 06:03.595
- We're doing really dangerous work...
- I'm freelance. This will all be private.

06:03.695 --> 06:07.775
I thought she could do a piece for us,
alright? If this is successful this time,

06:07.875 --> 06:10.840
we're going to need somebody
to report on it, objectively.

06:10.940 --> 06:14.101
You said yourself from the beginning,
we're trying to change the world...

06:14.201 --> 06:18.646
Honestly, I could use someone that
could talk about my work in lay terms.

06:18.746 --> 06:23.231
A reporter on our side
is gonna change lives.

06:27.620 --> 06:29.670
Alright.

06:30.855 --> 06:33.525
No stories on Martha or Gabby, okay?

06:33.625 --> 06:35.927
Stay focused on the work at hand.

06:36.027 --> 06:39.429
Henry, you remember Devon?

06:39.529 --> 06:41.365
Devon.

06:41.865 --> 06:43.333
You ready?

06:43.433 --> 06:47.852
Alright. I got here early.
There's equipment upstairs already, okay?

06:51.139 --> 06:53.301
Let me help you with that.

07:27.102 --> 07:29.203
No thanks, I've got my own.

07:29.303 --> 07:31.670
So do the lights not work
anymore in this place?

07:31.770 --> 07:35.441
I prefer to use our portable power. Okay?

07:35.541 --> 07:38.911
Wiring in here sets the EMF
all over the place.

07:39.011 --> 07:41.112
And I can't get a good read.

07:41.212 --> 07:45.616
So you're saying that a spike
in the electromagnetic field

07:45.716 --> 07:48.384
means that there's ghosts around?

07:48.484 --> 07:50.621
Well, almost.

07:50.721 --> 07:55.905
Ghosts and spirits are a form of energy,
so a spike in the EMF meter

07:56.005 --> 07:58.841
can indicate a presence.

07:59.762 --> 08:02.897
We just have better data
to back up our claims.

08:02.997 --> 08:06.015
Yeah, like holding a seance.

08:07.733 --> 08:12.326
Do you think that perhaps these high EMFs

08:12.426 --> 08:16.246
could be the cause of paranoia
or hallucinations

08:16.346 --> 08:21.126
that would make one 'think'
that they're seeing ghosts?

08:22.780 --> 08:25.481
There have been some claims.

08:25.581 --> 08:27.400
But...

08:27.500 --> 08:31.414
when you see what we're doing,
you'll know it's no hallucination.

08:32.520 --> 08:34.190
Upstairs.

08:34.289 --> 08:38.025
- Is there where he found her?
- Yeah.

08:38.125 --> 08:42.477
So you guys were working
in an active serial killer site?

08:43.297 --> 08:47.166
We figured since the cops
were onto it, we'd go on the run.

08:47.266 --> 08:50.636
So we set our experiments
here in the house.

08:51.636 --> 08:54.854
We didn't anticipate that he'd return.

08:55.640 --> 08:58.325
Well, he ain't gonna return this time.

08:59.809 --> 09:02.227
Can we go up?

09:03.045 --> 09:07.567
That's the only place to go. The attic,
that's where we set up base camp.

09:41.277 --> 09:45.663
So these are the rooms
where we'll be searching for ghosts.

09:47.482 --> 09:51.468
Well, hopefully with the high energy
surrounding this place we'll find something.

09:52.819 --> 09:55.637
Just one of his many rooms.

10:45.795 --> 10:48.298
Hey, are you okay?

10:48.398 --> 10:50.973
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

10:52.733 --> 10:55.003
Thought of Martha and Gabby.

10:55.103 --> 10:56.804
In there.

10:56.904 --> 10:59.755
Yeah, yeah. I know. I know.

11:02.040 --> 11:05.127
Why don't you stay
out of here for a bit, okay?

11:07.378 --> 11:09.596
You good?

11:37.169 --> 11:39.386
What is it?

11:40.038 --> 11:42.185
- What is it?
- I...

11:42.285 --> 11:44.275
I thought I felt something.

11:44.375 --> 11:47.812
You can feel the sadness in this place.

11:47.912 --> 11:50.313
It's the residual memories.

11:50.413 --> 11:53.437
All the dark energy surrounding it.

11:54.217 --> 11:57.202
Stains even the walls.

11:59.605 --> 12:03.491
Come on. Let's go up to the attic.

12:24.441 --> 12:26.442
What is this thing?

12:26.542 --> 12:29.160
This is what we've been working on.

12:32.915 --> 12:34.933
I designed it.

12:35.851 --> 12:38.268
Neil here built it.

12:38.920 --> 12:40.855
Jessica is in charge
of all the programming for it.

12:40.955 --> 12:45.476
- It's the only one of its kind.
- It's a machine designed to capture ghosts

12:45.576 --> 12:48.246
and generate ectoplasm out of them.

12:48.346 --> 12:51.430
- Wait? Like the one Robert Bess invented?
- This is my design.

12:51.530 --> 12:53.698
Do you mind if I record this
for my article?

12:53.798 --> 12:56.868
And can you try explaining
how all this works?

12:56.968 --> 13:00.787
Or at the very least,
what else needs to be done.

13:03.206 --> 13:04.742
Well...

13:04.842 --> 13:07.592
A general idea
is that the containment chamber

13:07.692 --> 13:11.146
is able to analyze its surroundings
for haunted activity.

13:11.246 --> 13:14.883
Since all ghosts have
their own magnetic properties,

13:14.983 --> 13:19.849
it has to be a specific inverse
electric magnetic charge.

13:26.724 --> 13:29.728
And this is where
the problematic part comes in.

13:29.828 --> 13:32.863
Now, once the ghost has been captured,

13:32.963 --> 13:37.266
this machine is supposed to convert
electromagnetic energy

13:37.366 --> 13:39.436
into ectoplasm.

13:39.536 --> 13:44.890
Sorry, can you repeat the last part?

13:45.674 --> 13:50.902
You're creating ectoplasm.

13:51.845 --> 13:53.347
That's what we're trying to do.

13:53.447 --> 13:56.270
In theory we discovered that...

13:56.370 --> 13:59.565
every ectoplasm
has its own unique quality.

13:59.665 --> 14:02.619
Kind of like a ghost DNA.

14:02.719 --> 14:06.491
Each one of them is unique
in its own right, okay?

14:06.691 --> 14:09.931
Hypothetically, this machine should be able
to tell us everything we need to know

14:10.031 --> 14:12.674
about where the ectoplasm came from,

14:12.774 --> 14:15.231
and who it was when it was living.

14:15.531 --> 14:20.735
You think you can identify
beings with ectoplasm?

14:20.835 --> 14:25.305
That's the only way we're going
to find out if it's Martha and Gabby.

14:26.205 --> 14:28.983
I have to know that it's them.

14:30.609 --> 14:36.482
Only then can we consider
our work here a success.

14:37.748 --> 14:39.633
Yeah.

14:40.252 --> 14:42.884
Let's get back to work then.

15:08.107 --> 15:11.392
- Henry, come here.
- What is it?

15:46.970 --> 15:50.418
Hey. What are you doing up here?

16:16.145 --> 16:17.796
Coffee?

16:19.265 --> 16:21.083
Thanks.

16:31.807 --> 16:33.710
So...

16:33.810 --> 16:35.894
What are you making?

16:36.210 --> 16:38.528
Preservation agent.

16:39.646 --> 16:41.350
For?

16:41.450 --> 16:43.420
Ectoplasm...

16:43.520 --> 16:47.587
deteriorates moments upon
being exposed to the elements.

16:47.687 --> 16:51.658
Oxygen, air, something. I don't know.

16:51.758 --> 16:54.225
If we're going to create ectoplasm,

16:54.325 --> 16:59.030
we have to preserve it long enough that
we can run all of our experiments on it.

16:59.130 --> 17:03.351
And it's the only way
that I can identify the ectoplasm

17:03.451 --> 17:07.559
as belonging to Martha and Gabby.

17:11.873 --> 17:16.726
So you're trying to put science
in the paranormal.

17:18.579 --> 17:21.614
Science is merely the discovery
of the unknown.

17:21.714 --> 17:25.752
Just because you don't understand
something, doesn't mean it's paranormal.

17:25.852 --> 17:28.036
Just undiscovered.

17:29.053 --> 17:33.338
So all you need now is to find
the spirits and capture them.

17:34.992 --> 17:37.283
And since none of us is psychic...

17:38.294 --> 17:41.062
we created these goggles...

17:41.162 --> 17:45.615
to detect the presence
of spiritual entities.

17:45.968 --> 17:50.839
You're saying I could actually see
ghosts with these?

17:50.939 --> 17:53.490
I would love to try it out.

17:58.276 --> 18:00.096
Careful.

20:02.845 --> 20:05.314
Amy! Amy!

20:05.414 --> 20:08.483
Are you okay? I heard you scream.

20:10.460 --> 20:12.909
Yeah. I'm... I'm fine.

20:15.355 --> 20:19.960
- You're still not convinced, are you?
- I'm not saying I don't believe in it.

20:20.060 --> 20:25.879
I'm just saying that most of the time
there's another explanation for it.

20:28.165 --> 20:30.567
Alright, well, the machine's ready.

20:30.767 --> 20:33.285
- Yeah.
- Let's go.

20:43.278 --> 20:44.813
Hey.

20:44.913 --> 20:47.447
I think Amy might have found
something on the radar.

20:47.547 --> 20:52.055
- What did you see?
- It looked like moving shadows, but...

20:52.155 --> 20:55.421
as I told Neil, it could have been
light from outside.

20:55.521 --> 21:00.441
Keep an open mind.
Constant skepticism can be unhealthy.

21:01.425 --> 21:03.227
Okay.

21:03.627 --> 21:08.097
Back to the machine.
Tell me where we are in all this.

21:08.197 --> 21:11.300
Okay, so I re-calibrated the machine.

21:11.400 --> 21:14.169
Previously, the magnets didn't have
their own voltage setting.

21:14.269 --> 21:17.071
So I installed 3 magnets
with their own motor.

21:17.171 --> 21:20.862
Which means they can work independently
against each other. Alright?

21:21.442 --> 21:25.786
Each magnet has a specific polarized path,
and with each one being an integer,

21:25.886 --> 21:30.103
we can hone in on the exact cross-
electromagnetic fields to capture any spirits.

21:30.583 --> 21:32.550
What are you measuring
your magnetic charge against?

21:32.650 --> 21:36.719
Your scanners are measuring
a spiritual energy in voltages, right?

21:36.819 --> 21:40.181
- Yes, SI voltage. SI base in coulombs.
- Okay, well, same thing.

21:40.481 --> 21:44.061
Except we're on the negative side
to counter any activity.

21:44.761 --> 21:46.563
Okay.

21:47.563 --> 21:49.781
You guys ready?

21:50.131 --> 21:52.265
Let's go get some ghosts.

21:52.365 --> 21:55.402
Test these new modifications.

21:55.502 --> 21:58.071
Wanna give this another go?

21:58.371 --> 21:59.939
I'll try to be more open this time.

22:00.039 --> 22:02.040
Let's see if we can find something
up here first.

22:02.140 --> 22:03.991
Okay.

22:22.558 --> 22:24.892
I think I got something.

22:24.992 --> 22:28.830
Over here by the box.
It just looks like some kind of mask.

22:28.930 --> 22:31.648
- Over here?
- No, left corner.

22:32.165 --> 22:34.133
I can feel something.

22:34.233 --> 22:37.202
SI's only 115.2.

22:37.302 --> 22:39.472
That very small.
Are you sure it's a ghost?

22:39.572 --> 22:41.206
I don't know what it is.

22:41.306 --> 22:44.342
Looks like some kind of blob
on the glasses.

22:44.442 --> 22:47.979
- That's probably residual memory.
- No, my readings confirm it's paranormal.

22:48.079 --> 22:50.596
Give it a shot anyway.

22:51.348 --> 22:54.182
Setting stat volt at negative 115.2.

22:54.282 --> 22:56.300
Standing by.

22:58.219 --> 23:00.704
Powering up the decoder.

23:01.321 --> 23:03.572
We're set.

23:08.895 --> 23:11.145
I've got something.

23:16.184 --> 23:18.569
It's in the machine.

23:54.132 --> 23:56.349
Ectoplasm.

24:00.669 --> 24:04.908
Take one of us, Henry,
we'll take one of you.

24:05.408 --> 24:07.410
An eye for an eye!

24:07.510 --> 24:10.060
Tooth for a tooth.

24:14.849 --> 24:16.648
We did it!

24:16.748 --> 24:19.996
Easy, easy, easy!
We don't wanna break this vial.

24:20.096 --> 24:22.483
Remember, ectoplasm disintegrates

24:22.583 --> 24:25.067
within moments of coming
in contact with the elements.

24:25.167 --> 24:30.729
We don't want to miss any chance of
losing identification with any ghost DNA.

24:30.829 --> 24:36.333
We have to get this right if we have
any chance of getting Martha and Gabby.

24:36.433 --> 24:41.036
Is there any way your can validate
your claim that this is ectoplasm?

24:41.136 --> 24:42.971
I'm gonna work on some code.

24:43.071 --> 24:45.739
It's a start. We'll know once
we get more ectoplasm samples.

24:45.839 --> 24:48.343
Let's go. We don't have much time left.

24:48.443 --> 24:50.511
No, no, no, no. Wait.

24:50.611 --> 24:53.713
Did anyone ever stop to think
that this can all be dangerous?

24:53.813 --> 24:56.081
We're merely retrieving information
at this point, Devon.

24:56.181 --> 24:59.752
Exactly! From another dimension.

24:59.852 --> 25:02.552
Priest, shamans, and pagans,
they have rituals to protect themselves.

25:02.652 --> 25:05.616
We know what we're doing. We'll have
our protocols fully up and running,

25:05.716 --> 25:09.811
- when this is going.
- So now you're an expert in occult history.

25:11.761 --> 25:15.812
I don't see anything else
that could be paranormal left.

25:16.765 --> 25:18.633
The attic seems clean.

25:18.733 --> 25:22.042
If your claims are true,
then perhaps we should go downstairs

25:22.142 --> 25:25.373
and try to find more of those samples
Neil was talking about.

25:25.473 --> 25:28.111
With the new mods on the machine,
do you think we can get this thing mobile

25:28.211 --> 25:32.078
- and get it there?
- Goggles and scanners are already mobile.

25:32.178 --> 25:35.480
All we need to do is separate the demagnetizer
and the rest of the machine can stay here.

25:35.580 --> 25:38.783
- How are you going to do that?
- Well, I'll need a motor.

25:38.883 --> 25:41.385
Probably a generator.

25:41.485 --> 25:43.820
Definitely gonna be battery operated.

25:43.920 --> 25:47.355
I saw some stuff laying around outside.
Maybe you can use it.

25:47.455 --> 25:51.643
- It's old and rusty though.
- Okay. Yeah. I'll take a look.

25:53.461 --> 25:57.042
Bring me back some chain, would you?
I wanna stabilize the machine.

25:57.142 --> 26:00.434
It was shaking when
the demagnetizer was going off.

26:00.534 --> 26:03.018
Yeah, you got it.

26:40.698 --> 26:44.085
Well... looks like the analysis works.

26:44.185 --> 26:47.071
But I can't make out
any language in the code.

26:47.171 --> 26:49.707
This is your 'ghost DNA'
you were talking about.

26:49.807 --> 26:52.226
How do you guys even read all this stuff?

26:52.326 --> 26:54.660
Well, this is what the computer analyzed.

26:54.760 --> 26:57.446
Decrypting it, it's another story.

26:57.546 --> 26:59.505
We've got to know
what ghosts we're capturing.

26:59.605 --> 27:02.084
We have to be able to identify them.

27:02.184 --> 27:05.619
We don't know if it's Martha, Gabby,
could be any ghost in here.

27:05.719 --> 27:07.938
- You think there could be a pattern?
- Everything has a pattern.

27:08.038 --> 27:11.890
Basic mathematics and chaos theory.
It's just figuring how much.

27:12.925 --> 27:14.361
Interesting.

27:14.461 --> 27:16.564
I wonder if...

27:16.895 --> 27:21.099
- What's happening here?
- I used Maxwell's equation on the data.

27:21.499 --> 27:23.968
Maxwell's equation?

27:25.168 --> 27:28.905
Essentially, Maxwell's equation
is to classical electromagnetism.

27:29.005 --> 27:32.073
What Newton's law of motion
and law of universal gravitation are to...

27:32.173 --> 27:34.457
classical mechanics.

27:36.511 --> 27:39.397
- Binary.
- Yeah.

27:41.647 --> 27:43.798
I wonder...

27:45.752 --> 27:50.138
What if we use the cassette speaker
as a output decoder.

27:51.857 --> 27:53.992
You can decode this binary into sound?

27:54.092 --> 27:55.973
To sound waves.

27:56.093 --> 27:59.578
No idea what we'll come up with,
no guarantees.

27:59.678 --> 28:01.865
Messages from the afterlife.

28:02.065 --> 28:03.941
If our EVP...

28:04.041 --> 28:08.326
can pick up specific information
only the deceased person would know,

28:08.426 --> 28:12.340
that would be our proof.
Wouldn't matter what the message is.

28:18.044 --> 28:20.479
What's going on with Neil?

28:20.579 --> 28:23.064
Still looking, I guess.

28:23.781 --> 28:26.266
I'll go check on him.

28:51.304 --> 28:53.155
Perfect.

28:53.607 --> 28:55.423
Neil.

28:55.942 --> 28:58.678
- Find something?
- Yeah.

28:58.778 --> 29:03.048
I found this old motor and a chainsaw.

29:03.148 --> 29:06.967
I think I can get it to work.
Hopefully the wiring is still good.

29:07.818 --> 29:10.254
Come on. Let's head back
so I can work on this.

29:10.354 --> 29:12.739
Who are you talking to?

29:38.877 --> 29:43.815
I thought it was Henry right
beside me and I turn around,

29:43.915 --> 29:47.734
I look up, Henry is right there
in front of me.

29:48.083 --> 29:50.319
S... yeah.

29:50.419 --> 29:53.455
And the ghost did nothing to you?

29:53.555 --> 29:55.324
Said nothing to you?

29:55.424 --> 29:58.708
I thought all the ghosts
are supposed to be inside.

29:59.060 --> 30:01.629
Ghosts do move around.

30:01.729 --> 30:04.164
We have to get moving
if the ghosts are moving around.

30:04.264 --> 30:07.032
Wanna get started finishing up
the modifications on the demagnetizer.

30:07.132 --> 30:09.335
I'll clean up the code.
Make it simple and more efficient.

30:09.435 --> 30:12.552
Guy, you can always use
seals to keep them in.

30:16.040 --> 30:19.944
For being a bunch of ghost hunters, you sure
don't know much about the occult, do you?

30:20.044 --> 30:24.563
Occult and paranormal science
isn't exactly the same.

30:24.979 --> 30:27.331
Maybe you should try this.

30:29.133 --> 30:31.501
Clavicula Salomonis Regis.

30:33.521 --> 30:36.524
- What is this?
- It's the Lesser Key of Solomon.

30:36.624 --> 30:41.094
It's a grimoire. 17th century collection
of books used to conjure the spirits.

30:41.494 --> 30:44.831
We can use the seals inside
to keep the ghost from getting in.

30:46.131 --> 30:48.615
Or out of the place.

30:50.568 --> 30:53.304
I'm using science.
You're using occult theories.

30:53.404 --> 30:55.306
So what else do you have?

30:55.406 --> 30:58.974
These seals have been used for centuries,
and if it works why not use it?

30:59.074 --> 31:02.959
It's not gonna ruin your little
science experiment just trying, is it?

31:04.480 --> 31:06.530
Alright.

31:07.849 --> 31:09.850
What do these seals do?

31:09.950 --> 31:13.703
If you draw them around the house,
in front of the windows, in front of doors,

31:13.803 --> 31:16.838
you can stop the ghost from getting out.

31:17.522 --> 31:19.758
But we need salt.

31:19.858 --> 31:22.792
Alright, I'll look in the kitchen.

31:23.861 --> 31:26.245
Might get lucky.

31:27.496 --> 31:29.547
Let me come.

31:29.966 --> 31:32.069
I can help you draw it out.

31:32.169 --> 31:34.886
I can be of use around here, you know?

31:35.836 --> 31:37.369
Alright, we'll try this.

31:37.469 --> 31:40.537
I need the rest of you working.
We can't afford to slow down.

31:40.637 --> 31:44.944
Yeah, Neil, I can use your help
soldering the speaker to the decoder.

31:45.044 --> 31:49.045
Yeah. Yeah, of course. Let's do it.

32:04.128 --> 32:06.579
Everything is rotten.

32:06.929 --> 32:09.448
At least salt doesn't go bad.

32:14.168 --> 32:18.055
- What is it?
- I thought I've seen something.

32:21.541 --> 32:24.560
You really are sensitive to these things.

32:27.878 --> 32:30.296
I kinda like this stuff.

32:32.050 --> 32:33.945
But to be honest with you...

32:34.045 --> 32:38.004
I think you guys are messing with something
you know very little about.

32:41.291 --> 32:43.175
Henry...

32:43.726 --> 32:46.977
do you think these ghosts know
what we're doing here?

32:47.912 --> 32:50.196
They don't like it.

32:50.531 --> 32:52.982
You're thinking too much.

32:59.973 --> 33:03.810
It's not much. Can you work with it?

33:04.510 --> 33:06.411
Yeah.

33:06.511 --> 33:08.963
It's enough to seal.

33:14.684 --> 33:18.219
- I'm out.
- Yeah, I'm almost out too.

33:18.319 --> 33:20.972
I'll go in the kitchen and find some more.

36:05.254 --> 36:07.107
Henry!

36:27.873 --> 36:31.242
I saw... I saw something!

36:31.342 --> 36:34.484
We must... they said we must get out.

36:35.014 --> 36:36.813
There's something here too.

36:36.913 --> 36:39.632
No. This isn't supposed to happen.
Something's wrong.

37:03.569 --> 37:07.339
- What happened?
- Henry's bleeding!

37:07.439 --> 37:10.943
A poltergeist... we got attacked.

37:11.043 --> 37:13.744
Get a shirt. Get a shirt.
We've got to stop the bleeding.

37:13.844 --> 37:16.329
Devon, are you okay?

37:16.969 --> 37:21.282
- Is him gonna be okay?
- My arm hurts, my back hurts but I'm alive.

37:21.382 --> 37:24.654
What happened down there?
Just leave it on.

37:24.754 --> 37:28.806
It started happening
as we were finishing the seals.

37:29.190 --> 37:31.807
I've never seen ghosts
act that violent before.

37:31.907 --> 37:35.014
- They were aware of our presence.
- Where?

37:35.114 --> 37:38.898
It knows what you're trying to do
and it doesn't want us here.

37:38.998 --> 37:41.399
We have to get out.

37:41.499 --> 37:45.704
- Baby, we're going to get out soon.
- No, no, no, no. We have to stay, alright?

37:45.804 --> 37:48.206
We gotta push on. We gotta stay here.

37:48.306 --> 37:50.807
We have to stay because
if the ghost are getting hostile,

37:50.907 --> 37:53.872
then Gabby and Martha
could be in danger. Alright?

37:53.972 --> 37:56.145
Neil, tell me what's going on
with the machine?

37:56.245 --> 38:00.532
- It's done, the modifications are done.
- I decoded the ectoplasm.

38:00.632 --> 38:04.254
You have to hear it. Okay, hold on, guys.

38:05.986 --> 38:10.106
I decrypted the ectoplasm. You have
to listen. Check out the sound waves.

38:50.955 --> 38:53.239
What is it?

38:54.725 --> 38:56.676
Play it one more time.

39:00.896 --> 39:02.765
There!

39:02.865 --> 39:06.217
Between the second scream
and the third wail,

39:06.317 --> 39:08.219
sounds like...

39:09.370 --> 39:13.756
Sound like it's saying,
'An eye for an eye.'

39:16.175 --> 39:18.394
Guys, this is it.

39:19.780 --> 39:22.615
Proof of the existence of ghosts.

39:22.715 --> 39:25.950
A spiritual realm.
They're sending a message to us.

39:26.050 --> 39:30.309
Messages from their DNA. Embedded in time.

39:30.689 --> 39:33.123
I can't believe you, guys.

39:33.223 --> 39:35.925
Can't you see it doesn't want us here!

39:36.025 --> 39:38.476
Martha and Gabby.

39:38.895 --> 39:42.130
- They're still here, someplace.
- Are you hearing this?

39:42.230 --> 39:46.400
Dev. Dev, Henry's right.
This is a huge breakthrough.

39:46.500 --> 39:48.936
I don't care about your breakthrough!

39:49.036 --> 39:52.806
Henry is bleeding and all you care about
is your little ghost experiments.

39:53.206 --> 39:55.775
These experiments aren't little.

39:55.875 --> 39:58.661
I don't want the spirit
of my wife and my daughter

39:58.761 --> 40:01.282
floating around in here, suffering!

40:01.480 --> 40:03.982
We're doing this all for them!

40:04.382 --> 40:07.050
- I'm done.
- Devon!

40:07.150 --> 40:09.287
No! I'm sick of this.

40:09.387 --> 40:13.123
You guys are crazy and I don't want
to have anything to do with this.

40:13.223 --> 40:17.142
You're messing with things
that you think you know.

40:18.158 --> 40:19.962
Devon.

40:20.462 --> 40:23.906
- She'll calm down.
- She doesn't calm down.

40:27.867 --> 40:31.627
Okay. Come on, let's finish this.

40:35.306 --> 40:37.423
Devon!

40:38.643 --> 40:41.394
Devon, come over here.

40:42.012 --> 40:43.896
Henry?

40:46.782 --> 40:49.351
Henry, is that you?

40:49.451 --> 40:53.237
Yes, Devon. It's me, Henry.

40:53.521 --> 40:58.141
It's all over now, we're going to go home.

42:39.507 --> 42:40.852
Devon!

42:56.954 --> 42:59.604
We're going to need more ectoplasm.

43:00.324 --> 43:02.425
You guys are going to be okay
with me coming?

43:02.525 --> 43:06.587
You can play with those goggles.
Might as well be in charge of them.

43:06.687 --> 43:10.264
I'll take care of the scanner, and Neil,
you can be in charge of the demagnetizer.

43:10.364 --> 43:14.369
- Yeah, I'm coming with you.
- No, you are not.

43:14.469 --> 43:17.137
Your wounds are barely healed, closed up.

43:17.237 --> 43:19.205
What do you expect me to do?
Stay here all by myself?

43:19.305 --> 43:23.457
We're just going to have a test run
down there. Get a couple more samples.

43:24.142 --> 43:27.045
Alright.
Don't go in Martha's room, alright?

43:27.145 --> 43:29.533
Wait for me. I'll be ready then.

43:32.451 --> 43:35.886
Don't worry.
You'll need all your strength soon.

43:35.986 --> 43:38.088
You think this is a good idea?

43:38.188 --> 43:41.023
So long as we all stay together.

43:41.123 --> 43:43.191
Can ghosts kill us?

43:43.291 --> 43:45.859
There's no direct evidence to support it,

43:45.959 --> 43:50.611
but in Henry's case they did manipulate
objects to cause harm.

43:51.866 --> 43:55.218
So is that a yes or a no?

44:03.174 --> 44:06.210
Hey, do you think turning on the lights
will mess up the scanner?

44:06.310 --> 44:09.612
- Henry said the old wiring would.
- No.

44:09.712 --> 44:13.364
These new scanners are way better
at filtering cross-frequencies.

44:17.520 --> 44:20.972
Damn, nothing in this house works right.

44:24.126 --> 44:26.593
All the switches on one light?

44:26.893 --> 44:29.277
Seems like it.

44:40.338 --> 44:42.252
- The reading just spiked.
- Can you get a scan of it?

44:42.352 --> 44:45.308
- I think so. Am I on the right spot?
- Yeah.

44:45.408 --> 44:47.893
I think it went in there.

45:22.304 --> 45:25.976
Henry, get up. There's someone coming.

45:26.576 --> 45:28.177
Martha.

45:28.277 --> 45:33.457
- Come on, get up.
- Everything's going to be okay.

45:34.615 --> 45:37.033
Kill them all!

46:36.431 --> 46:38.999
You're like the first one.

46:45.973 --> 46:48.391
One of many to come.

47:12.393 --> 47:14.911
I don't see anything.

47:21.533 --> 47:24.238
- There's something there!
- What is it? What is it? What is it?

47:24.338 --> 47:26.120
I got something.

47:27.872 --> 47:31.781
Okay, almost there.
A charge of 667.84. 667.84!

47:31.881 --> 47:35.728
667.84. Okay, ready?

47:53.843 --> 47:56.261
What happened?

48:07.337 --> 48:11.141
You are a religious man.
Do you remember this?

48:11.241 --> 48:13.443
Please don't.

48:13.743 --> 48:18.215
Yes. Abraham and his son.

48:18.315 --> 48:21.650
This is where he sacrifices him.

48:22.984 --> 48:26.969
Please, please don't do this.

48:31.592 --> 48:36.227
Imagine... this must be
how his son Isaac felt

48:36.327 --> 48:41.381
when Abraham was put
to the test... by the Lord.

48:47.237 --> 48:49.706
Do you feel it?

48:50.926 --> 48:53.413
The panic?

48:54.063 --> 48:55.877
The fear!

49:01.882 --> 49:04.401
I got it! I got it!

49:06.452 --> 49:09.437
I must've... dropped my camera.

49:10.823 --> 49:13.025
This container isn't gonna hold it long.
We gotta go.

49:13.125 --> 49:16.703
- I'll check for your camera in a bit.
- Don't worry abut it.

49:34.574 --> 49:36.425
Hey.

49:38.245 --> 49:40.063
Hey.

49:42.319 --> 49:45.914
Any luck?
Hearing out anything else was said?

49:46.014 --> 49:49.270
No. No, just those sounds.

49:51.888 --> 49:53.758
Well...

49:54.158 --> 49:57.427
- we caught something.
- Where?

49:57.527 --> 50:01.379
- The occult room.
- Set the depolarizer. Let's go.

50:26.149 --> 50:29.135
Full spiritual manifestation.

50:35.224 --> 50:37.225
Run the decoder.

50:45.232 --> 50:47.250
Play it.

51:19.092 --> 51:22.578
Guys. This is it.

51:22.695 --> 51:27.484
The whole process. From scanning,
to the decryption of ectoplasm DNA.

51:27.584 --> 51:30.463
- We did it.
- Wait. Someone else is here.

51:30.563 --> 51:34.820
- What?
- There's another energy in here.

51:35.173 --> 51:38.093
I felt it downstairs
before we headed into the room.

51:38.193 --> 51:40.811
- Martha? Gabby?
- No.

51:40.911 --> 51:43.562
It's the same feeling
I had in the kitchen.

51:44.113 --> 51:46.583
It's not like the ghosts.

51:46.683 --> 51:50.368
There's no distress. No pain.

51:50.618 --> 51:52.991
It's darker.

51:53.091 --> 51:55.550
Almost demonic.

51:57.924 --> 52:00.442
Hey. Hey.

52:01.060 --> 52:04.897
They have more reason
to be afraid of us, okay?

52:04.997 --> 52:10.517
I don't know how I know it.
I just feel it.

52:11.503 --> 52:17.274
Okay, well, it's normal to feel weird.
To feel spooked out, alright?

52:17.374 --> 52:20.157
This is the Night Stalker's house.

52:22.144 --> 52:24.679
Look, I've started to see things.

52:24.779 --> 52:26.414
What?

52:26.514 --> 52:31.499
Sense things I've never felt before.

52:33.120 --> 52:37.290
I want to see the whole process
again with my own eyes.

52:37.390 --> 52:40.306
And then we go and get Martha and Gabby.

52:40.826 --> 52:45.630
- Are you sure you're ready for that?
- I'm fine. My arm's fine.

52:45.730 --> 52:48.648
Let's go! We don't have a lot of time.

52:58.674 --> 53:02.343
This is Officer Mack.
I'm on Blackburn Lane house now. Over.

53:02.443 --> 53:06.004
<i>S&R Realty has requested patrol on property.
Security is non-responsive.</i>

53:06.104 --> 53:08.858
Copy. Who am I looking for?

53:08.958 --> 53:13.665
<i>Check the premises for any unauthorized
trespassers and report back.</i>

53:14.352 --> 53:16.520
I got a visual on 3 vehicles.

53:16.620 --> 53:20.022
Run a check on license plate TRR544,

53:20.122 --> 53:25.762
YDK178, and FDR012. I'll be back.

53:25.862 --> 53:28.931
<i>10-4. Do not go into the house,
set up perimeter.</i>

53:29.031 --> 53:30.882
Copy.

54:01.657 --> 54:03.759
I'm only getting a small ratings.

54:03.859 --> 54:06.377
I can't pick anything up yet.

54:14.334 --> 54:17.620
- Something's here.
- It's spiking.

54:21.241 --> 54:23.510
I can see her.

54:23.610 --> 54:25.794
Let me see.

54:26.978 --> 54:30.630
Fourth lens, dial it at 32 degrees.

54:38.753 --> 54:41.973
- It's moving.
- I need a frequency!

54:42.073 --> 54:44.926
449.67. 449.67.

54:45.026 --> 54:47.178
Alright. Here we go.

55:04.407 --> 55:06.359
Peek-a-boo.

55:15.150 --> 55:17.602
I need some food.

55:28.061 --> 55:30.579
I need some food.

55:36.435 --> 55:40.371
No, no! I can't. I can't eat meat!

55:54.538 --> 55:57.289
- I got it! I got it!
- Amy!

55:58.307 --> 56:00.125
Amy!

56:50.749 --> 56:52.567
Hello?

56:56.821 --> 56:58.939
Come on!

57:01.824 --> 57:04.141
Somebody help me!

57:22.041 --> 57:23.893
- What happened?
- She was catatonic

57:23.993 --> 57:26.868
while the magnetizer was going.
And the moment it stopped she passed out.

57:26.968 --> 57:29.146
- Hey, hey, hey!
- Epilepsy.

57:29.246 --> 57:31.576
No, she doesn't have epilepsy. Come on!

57:31.676 --> 57:33.781
The strobe lights.
This could be her first time.

57:33.881 --> 57:37.436
Hey, baby! Hey, baby!
Come back. Come back.

57:39.756 --> 57:45.494
Hey, it's okay! It's okay! It's okay.
You're back. It's okay. It's okay.

57:45.594 --> 57:47.913
You scared me.
I'm going to get you to a hospital.

57:48.013 --> 57:51.165
No. No, no, no, I'm fine.

57:51.265 --> 57:55.001
No, no. We gotta get you checked out.
We don't know what happened.

57:55.101 --> 57:56.987
Really.

57:57.087 --> 57:59.104
I'm fine.

58:03.607 --> 58:06.059
This isn't the first time.

58:07.245 --> 58:09.529
What do you mean?

58:10.380 --> 58:13.916
Every time the demagnetizer goes off...

58:14.016 --> 58:17.419
something happens to me.

58:17.519 --> 58:21.222
I go into some sort of trance.

58:21.322 --> 58:23.373
Trance?

58:23.892 --> 58:25.884
You mean, like having visions?

58:28.160 --> 58:30.262
What did you see?

58:30.362 --> 58:32.646
The killings.

58:33.199 --> 58:36.318
What happened in these rooms.

58:37.202 --> 58:39.520
Like I was there.

58:40.673 --> 58:43.357
Do you have any control over this?

58:44.342 --> 58:47.427
I don't know what's happening to me.

58:48.812 --> 58:52.071
Well, you're not gonna see it again, alright?
You're not gonna see it again.

58:52.171 --> 58:55.790
- We're not gonna put you in that...
- I saw a girl.

58:55.890 --> 58:59.505
She was forced to eat human meat.

59:00.255 --> 59:03.707
Gets off on the stress of its victims.

59:06.258 --> 59:10.010
Forces their bodies to the point
where they can die by stress.

59:11.530 --> 59:13.930
Just like Martha.

59:14.030 --> 59:16.133
The Night Stalker.

59:16.233 --> 59:21.653
He would use that monitor to measure
their stress levels before killing them.

59:23.873 --> 59:28.643
You know that dark demonic energy
I was talking about?

59:28.743 --> 59:31.227
I know what it is now.

59:31.978 --> 59:36.597
The Night Stalker.
I felt the same thing in my visions.

59:39.485 --> 59:43.454
You're saying
the Night Stalker's ghost is here?

59:43.554 --> 59:45.725
I don't know.

59:45.825 --> 59:48.860
But that sense of dread...

59:48.960 --> 59:51.377
I can't shake it off.

59:52.563 --> 59:56.449
Whatever or whoever is here...

59:58.668 --> 01:00:00.852
it doesn't want us here.

01:00:01.269 --> 01:00:03.721
And it's watching.

01:00:05.755 --> 01:00:09.179
I just... I just need some air.

01:00:09.279 --> 01:00:11.072
Yeah.

01:00:15.581 --> 01:00:17.898
What do you make of this?

01:01:00.184 --> 01:01:02.003
Gabby?

01:02:24.318 --> 01:02:28.055
He will lurk in your souls.

01:02:28.255 --> 01:02:30.139
Martha?

01:02:32.525 --> 01:02:35.428
Who... what are you saying?

01:02:35.528 --> 01:02:39.445
He's back. Don't fall asleep.

01:02:39.545 --> 01:02:41.782
Who's back?

01:03:35.376 --> 01:03:37.178
What are you doing here?

01:03:37.278 --> 01:03:39.162
Henry.

01:03:39.480 --> 01:03:42.665
I heard some noises
and I came to check it out.

01:03:42.882 --> 01:03:46.833
I think they were
coming from the rocking chair.

01:03:48.121 --> 01:03:50.372
Everything okay?

01:03:51.454 --> 01:03:54.039
Let's get the scanner on the chair.

01:04:02.565 --> 01:04:05.050
- Henry!
- Neil!

01:04:06.835 --> 01:04:10.253
I can't get it loose!
I can't get it loose!

01:04:15.641 --> 01:04:19.260
- Henry!
- Henry! Henry! Henry!

01:04:29.686 --> 01:04:32.655
- He's alive. Hurt bad though.
- This is the second time.

01:04:32.755 --> 01:04:35.640
It's like it's out for Henry or...

01:04:36.324 --> 01:04:38.442
What's wrong?

01:04:38.795 --> 01:04:41.062
What's wrong?

01:04:41.162 --> 01:04:43.231
When I was in the room...

01:04:43.331 --> 01:04:45.633
I heard Martha tell me something.

01:04:45.733 --> 01:04:49.018
She's been trying to warm me
more than once.

01:04:50.269 --> 01:04:53.671
- What kind of warning?
- About the poltergeist attacks.

01:04:53.771 --> 01:04:56.208
All the hauntings.

01:04:56.308 --> 01:04:58.544
I think the Night Stalker is back.

01:04:58.644 --> 01:05:01.445
He wants to finish what he started.

01:05:01.545 --> 01:05:04.648
He wants to kill Henry.
Kill us for coming into this house.

01:05:04.748 --> 01:05:08.445
- No, I think it's just Henry he wants.
- What about Martha and Gabby?

01:05:08.545 --> 01:05:10.617
Unless we get him out now,
he's gonna be dead.

01:05:10.717 --> 01:05:14.416
What if we just go? We take Henry
and we can keep him safe.

01:05:14.516 --> 01:05:16.224
No, no. He'll come back
with or without us.

01:05:16.324 --> 01:05:19.492
He's right. All Henry cares about
is getting Martha and Gabby.

01:05:19.592 --> 01:05:23.244
The only way we all leave,
is to end this now.

01:05:24.864 --> 01:05:27.182
We go get them.

01:05:31.103 --> 01:05:32.837
Amy.

01:05:32.937 --> 01:05:34.755
Amy.

01:05:37.641 --> 01:05:41.158
This is where Devon said
she saw Gabby's ghost.

01:05:47.282 --> 01:05:49.534
I feel her.

01:06:02.739 --> 01:06:05.178
What do you see?

01:06:07.066 --> 01:06:09.583
She's right behind you.

01:06:23.813 --> 01:06:26.231
She was right there.

01:06:27.781 --> 01:06:29.599
Gabby?

01:06:30.583 --> 01:06:35.036
Gabby, if you're here, give us a sign.

01:06:40.059 --> 01:06:41.877
Something.

01:06:45.162 --> 01:06:50.541
Gabby, if you have something
to tell us... now is the time.

01:06:57.973 --> 01:07:00.775
He's coming!

01:07:01.575 --> 01:07:03.811
- What happened? What happened?
- Hey!

01:07:03.911 --> 01:07:06.195
What did it say?

01:07:07.813 --> 01:07:10.265
She said he's coming.

01:07:10.849 --> 01:07:13.101
The Night Stalker?

01:07:13.819 --> 01:07:17.838
Okay. We should get
to Martha and Gabby's room.

01:07:18.657 --> 01:07:22.360
It's got the highest sense
of spiritual phenomenon.

01:07:22.460 --> 01:07:25.511
Okay. Let's go.

01:07:48.414 --> 01:07:50.665
Why is that light off?

01:07:53.984 --> 01:07:57.737
- Do you feel anything?
- There's something here.

01:08:02.658 --> 01:08:06.577
It's Gabby. She wants us to go in.

01:08:06.928 --> 01:08:09.679
Let's get them quick and get out of here.

01:08:10.097 --> 01:08:14.182
Keep your eyes open.
Night Stalker's ghost could be anywhere.

01:08:15.802 --> 01:08:17.953
I'll try.

01:08:27.211 --> 01:08:29.147
What's going on here?

01:08:29.247 --> 01:08:31.698
He knew we were coming.

01:08:36.285 --> 01:08:40.104
Check over there.
I'll try to get a visual.

01:08:50.497 --> 01:08:52.631
I'm not getting a reading.

01:08:52.732 --> 01:08:55.296
I don't see Martha anywhere.

01:09:02.606 --> 01:09:05.091
I'm not getting a reading.

01:09:10.145 --> 01:09:13.703
- What's going on?
- It's Gabby! She's on me, quick.

01:09:13.804 --> 01:09:16.142
- Eyes on Martha?
- I can't see her. Hurry!

01:09:16.242 --> 01:09:19.684
I have a reading 147.89.
We should try to get Gabby.

01:09:19.783 --> 01:09:24.207
- See if we have time to get Martha.
- Here we go! Setting charge!

01:10:08.428 --> 01:10:12.818
Do you feel... how close you are?

01:10:20.136 --> 01:10:24.221
Feel how alive your heart is.

01:10:24.774 --> 01:10:28.581
You ever wonder how much
a human heart can take?

01:10:37.617 --> 01:10:41.807
What did you want to tell me?
I'm listening.

01:10:45.722 --> 01:10:47.123
Mommy!

01:11:05.873 --> 01:11:08.957
- Neil, something's wrong!
- What?

01:11:09.672 --> 01:11:13.295
- What?
- Turn off the demagnetizer.

01:12:01.836 --> 01:12:04.152
She's going into shock!

01:12:05.354 --> 01:12:06.571
Henry?

01:12:10.776 --> 01:12:13.363
- Come back.
- Henry!

01:12:13.463 --> 01:12:15.374
Come back.

01:12:16.930 --> 01:12:19.566
There's nothing to be afraid of.

01:12:19.666 --> 01:12:21.810
You are going to be a part of history.

01:12:26.037 --> 01:12:29.490
An evolution of science.

01:12:36.113 --> 01:12:39.830
You're okay! You're okay!
You're okay! You're okay!

01:12:39.930 --> 01:12:43.350
- You're back. You're back, baby.
- Is she still with you?

01:12:43.618 --> 01:12:48.539
- What?
- Gabby? She... linked to you.

01:12:48.639 --> 01:12:51.392
She's been trying to use you
to get us up here.

01:12:51.492 --> 01:12:53.376
Link?

01:12:53.494 --> 01:12:57.697
You weren't psychic
before you got here, right?

01:12:57.797 --> 01:12:59.614
Gabby, the incident in the kitchen,

01:12:59.714 --> 01:13:02.968
I think she's been using you
to try to tell us the truth.

01:13:03.068 --> 01:13:05.286
The truth.

01:13:05.802 --> 01:13:07.690
I saw it all.

01:13:08.939 --> 01:13:11.123
We heard it all.

01:14:14.258 --> 01:14:16.142
Neil.

01:14:16.661 --> 01:14:18.678
Neil!

01:14:19.697 --> 01:14:22.519
He better not be doing...

01:14:22.619 --> 01:14:25.974
what I think he's doing.

01:14:51.622 --> 01:14:54.644
Henry can't be the Night Stalker.
It's not possible.

01:14:54.744 --> 01:14:58.961
I saw it all.
I saw him kill Martha and Gabby.

01:14:59.261 --> 01:15:02.096
And they found the killer
and you've been having those feelings...

01:15:02.196 --> 01:15:06.268
The energy I felt... is not a ghost.

01:15:06.368 --> 01:15:09.202
It's Henry I've been
picking up the whole time.

01:15:09.302 --> 01:15:13.807
Why would Henry kill Martha and Gabby?
They're his everything.

01:15:13.907 --> 01:15:16.576
I bet their ghosts want to know that too.

01:15:16.676 --> 01:15:20.746
- That doesn't make sense.
- You really can't look...

01:15:20.846 --> 01:15:25.082
at the situation from just one angle.

01:15:25.582 --> 01:15:27.432
Henry.

01:15:28.218 --> 01:15:30.469
What are you doing here?

01:15:32.522 --> 01:15:35.906
Seems you guys disappeared on me.

01:15:39.627 --> 01:15:42.079
What are you doing with that?

01:15:48.868 --> 01:15:51.904
Have you ever heard of Unit 731?

01:15:52.404 --> 01:15:54.172
Jessica.

01:15:54.672 --> 01:15:56.489
Neil.

01:15:57.276 --> 01:15:59.127
Amy.

01:16:03.279 --> 01:16:05.153
Horrible.

01:16:05.253 --> 01:16:09.741
Horrible atrocities committed
on prisoners of war by the Japanese...

01:16:10.441 --> 01:16:12.989
during World War II.

01:16:13.689 --> 01:16:17.953
Did you know that all of the scientists...

01:16:18.797 --> 01:16:21.935
were given pardons by the US government...

01:16:22.035 --> 01:16:26.882
in exchange for their... research.

01:16:28.133 --> 01:16:31.156
They tested the human body...

01:16:31.256 --> 01:16:34.958
to see how long it could endure pain...

01:16:35.337 --> 01:16:38.054
before it dies.

01:16:40.477 --> 01:16:42.961
But this was all excusable.

01:16:44.046 --> 01:16:46.280
Because you see...

01:16:46.380 --> 01:16:49.040
their experiments provided...

01:16:49.140 --> 01:16:53.247
advancements and leaps...

01:16:53.347 --> 01:16:57.406
in the science of the human body.

01:16:58.124 --> 01:17:01.542
World War II finished years ago, Henry.

01:17:02.060 --> 01:17:06.171
Science never changes, Neil.

01:17:06.664 --> 01:17:09.166
Just admit it, Henry.

01:17:09.266 --> 01:17:13.704
- You killed them.
- Not seeing the point.

01:17:13.804 --> 01:17:15.839
How could you?

01:17:15.939 --> 01:17:18.279
Your wife. Your daughter.

01:17:18.379 --> 01:17:21.811
The deaths weren't gruesome enough.

01:17:22.511 --> 01:17:26.312
We weren't making any movement
with our experiments...

01:17:26.412 --> 01:17:31.475
because the energies
of the spirits was weak.

01:17:32.885 --> 01:17:35.937
And I realized...

01:17:37.321 --> 01:17:39.858
- I had to up the ante.
- I can't believe it!

01:17:39.958 --> 01:17:42.677
How do you think it makes me feel?

01:17:44.161 --> 01:17:46.729
I had to sacrifice my wife.

01:17:46.829 --> 01:17:49.046
My daughter.

01:17:50.066 --> 01:17:53.251
You even know what that does to a man?

01:17:54.169 --> 01:17:58.189
I had to live with their blood
on my hands.

01:18:01.441 --> 01:18:05.694
But our research... we succeeded.

01:18:07.060 --> 01:18:11.283
Their... their deaths were not in vain.

01:18:11.383 --> 01:18:14.768
That's my only consolation.

01:18:20.024 --> 01:18:22.492
What was that?

01:18:22.592 --> 01:18:24.409
Nothing.

01:18:26.528 --> 01:18:28.330
What...

01:18:29.030 --> 01:18:30.932
was...

01:18:31.032 --> 01:18:32.849
that?

01:18:34.669 --> 01:18:37.705
I must have turned it on
when I came in the room.

01:18:37.805 --> 01:18:40.973
I forgot, I forgot to turn it off.

01:18:41.073 --> 01:18:45.310
You wanted to expose me?
You... you wanted a confession!

01:18:45.410 --> 01:18:47.993
No! It was an accident, please!

01:18:48.113 --> 01:18:52.055
And to think that I trusted you!

01:18:58.872 --> 01:19:01.340
- Go! Go!
- Come on!

01:19:01.440 --> 01:19:04.008
- No!
- Come on!

01:19:04.875 --> 01:19:06.343
Neil!

01:19:25.410 --> 01:19:26.890
It's over.

01:20:03.352 --> 01:20:06.003
Go, go, go, go!

01:20:08.522 --> 01:20:10.539
Over there!

01:21:15.177 --> 01:21:17.060
Go.

01:21:29.988 --> 01:21:32.006
Come on.

01:21:41.431 --> 01:21:44.015
Hide! Hide!

01:21:58.779 --> 01:22:01.706
Too many sins in his hands.

01:22:01.806 --> 01:22:05.933
Blood. The blood is in the machine.

01:22:10.104 --> 01:22:11.870
The Parabot machine.

01:22:41.963 --> 01:22:44.310
There you are!

01:23:16.941 --> 01:23:18.048
Henry!

01:23:23.081 --> 01:23:25.382
Let her go or I'll drop these!

01:23:25.482 --> 01:23:30.134
You're willing to risk your life for this?

01:23:30.686 --> 01:23:34.623
If I drop these you lose everything
that you worked for.

01:23:34.723 --> 01:23:39.760
So it's between... your life and my work?

01:23:40.060 --> 01:23:42.079
You're going to kill me anyway.

01:23:45.332 --> 01:23:49.150
True. True.

01:23:50.970 --> 01:23:53.448
But I'm gonna make sure, Jessica...

01:23:54.472 --> 01:23:59.442
that you suffer a slow one
before I'm finished with you!

01:23:59.542 --> 01:24:02.945
Henry!

01:24:13.154 --> 01:24:14.969
Drop them!

01:24:23.195 --> 01:24:25.046
Jess.

01:24:46.932 --> 01:24:48.711
Oh, God.
