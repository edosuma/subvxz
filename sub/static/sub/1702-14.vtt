WEBVTT

00:10.135 --> 00:13.929
'Cause every time I see your face

00:14.556 --> 00:18.100
I can't help but fall from grace

00:18.268 --> 00:19.852
Wow. This girl's good.

00:20.020 --> 00:23.856
Oh, yeah, a song with rhyming words.
Ooh, I never thought of that before.

00:26.192 --> 00:27.234
I like her.

00:27.402 --> 00:29.278
Why? Because she can sing
and play guitar...

00:29.446 --> 00:31.655
...and do both at the same time?

00:32.741 --> 00:35.492
Well, that's pretty much all I'm looking for
from these people.

00:36.369 --> 00:38.412
Look at you, all jealous.

00:38.580 --> 00:41.665
Yeah, Pheebs, come on.
You two have completely different styles.

00:41.833 --> 00:47.880
You know, she's more... you know?
And you're more:

00:49.257 --> 00:52.801
Say you'll stay beside me

00:57.807 --> 01:01.018
Okay. See? See?
Everybody else is happy she's done.

01:02.979 --> 01:05.647
Okay, my next song's called:

01:05.815 --> 01:08.692
"Phoebe Buffay, What Can I Say?
I Really Loved When We Were...

01:08.860 --> 01:12.321
...Singing Partners and I Shouldn't
Have Left You That Way."

01:14.657 --> 01:18.327
Oh, no. One of those
look-for-the-hidden-meaning songs.

02:09.086 --> 02:10.753
Hey, Phoebe.

02:10.922 --> 02:12.005
Hey, Leslie.

02:12.173 --> 02:13.715
How'd you know I'd be here?

02:13.883 --> 02:16.552
I ran into Vlad at the place
where they sell the big fish...

02:16.719 --> 02:18.720
...and he said you played here a lot, so...

02:18.888 --> 02:20.806
All right. I have to go to the bathroom.

02:20.974 --> 02:23.058
But if the place with the big fish
comes up again...

02:23.226 --> 02:27.104
...I'd like to know whether that's several
big fish or just one big fish.

02:28.398 --> 02:30.440
So Phoebe tells us you write jingles.

02:30.608 --> 02:33.360
Actually, I said she abandoned me
to write jingles.

02:35.446 --> 02:37.072
Uh, anything we might've heard of?

02:37.240 --> 02:39.283
Uh, yeah, um...

02:39.450 --> 02:41.660
Home is never far away

02:41.828 --> 02:45.497
Home is Homestar Stew

02:46.916 --> 02:50.294
Yeah, but I don't do that anymore.
I got kind of sick of it.

02:50.461 --> 02:54.923
And then I couldn't come up with
anything good, so they fired me.

02:55.091 --> 02:56.633
Hmm, bummer.

02:57.886 --> 02:59.970
Well, you know, I was just...

03:00.138 --> 03:04.641
Um, I was just thinking
and just hoping that...

03:04.809 --> 03:07.311
...maybe you'd want
to get back together?

03:07.937 --> 03:09.313
No, but thanks.

03:09.480 --> 03:11.899
Oh, come on, Phoebe.
Would you just think about it?

03:13.401 --> 03:14.610
Okay.

03:14.777 --> 03:16.111
No, but thanks.

03:19.782 --> 03:22.075
Okay, uh...

03:22.243 --> 03:23.994
See you, Pheebs.

03:26.915 --> 03:29.124
Wow. That was kind of brutal.

03:29.667 --> 03:31.877
Well, okay.
Let this be a lesson to all of you.

03:32.045 --> 03:35.631
All right? Once you betray me,
I become like the Ice Woman.

03:35.798 --> 03:40.969
You know, I'm just very cold,
hard, unyielding.

03:41.137 --> 03:44.556
You know, nothing, nothing
can penetrate this icy exterior.

03:44.724 --> 03:46.016
Can I have a tissue, please?

03:46.184 --> 03:47.309
Oh, yes.

03:52.941 --> 03:54.733
Is someone in there?

03:55.318 --> 03:57.653
No. This is just part
of a daredevil game...

03:57.820 --> 04:01.657
...that I play called "Wait Until
the Last Moment Before I Burst and Die."

04:02.116 --> 04:05.160
Jeez, man. Did you fall...? Hi.

04:06.037 --> 04:08.872
So, uh, did you? Did you fall high?

04:09.874 --> 04:12.251
Someone was in the ladies' room.
I couldn't wait.

04:12.418 --> 04:15.170
- I left the lid up for you, though.
- Ha, ha.

04:16.673 --> 04:19.091
You know what, uh, Gunther?
Go, uh... Go ahead.

04:19.259 --> 04:21.426
I'm talking to, uh...

04:22.845 --> 04:24.846
This is the part
where you say your name.

04:25.014 --> 04:28.475
- Ginger.
- Ginger. I'm talking to Ginger, so...

04:32.272 --> 04:35.357
- Don't you have to use the bathroom?
- No.

04:35.525 --> 04:38.360
No, I just, uh...
I'd rather, uh, talk to you.

04:39.362 --> 04:40.988
Yes, I do.

04:41.531 --> 04:44.074
Yes, I do have to go to the bathroom.

04:44.534 --> 04:46.535
Someone in here.

04:48.121 --> 04:50.163
- Where's Chandler?
- He can't make it.

04:50.331 --> 04:53.250
He said he had to go back
to his, uh, job to do, uh...

04:53.418 --> 04:54.876
Uh-oh.

04:55.878 --> 04:57.087
Joey?

04:59.007 --> 05:00.215
Joey Tribbiani?

05:06.264 --> 05:08.140
Joey, I can see you, okay?

05:08.308 --> 05:10.726
You're hiding behind the coats.

05:21.654 --> 05:23.447
Close one. Heh.

05:29.162 --> 05:30.829
- Hi.
- Hi, sweetie.

05:30.997 --> 05:32.956
Hello.

05:33.124 --> 05:34.374
Hey, Ross.

05:34.542 --> 05:35.959
Uh-huh.

05:37.295 --> 05:39.463
- I've got some bad news.
- What?

05:39.630 --> 05:41.965
I can get a quick bite,
but I have to come back here.

05:42.133 --> 05:45.427
Come on, sweetie. You've worked late
every night for the past two weeks.

05:45.595 --> 05:48.305
- What is it this time?
- It's kind of my fault. I quit today.

05:48.473 --> 05:50.390
But work comes first.

05:50.808 --> 05:54.061
Oh, hey. But that's sad about you, though.
What happened?

05:54.228 --> 05:57.689
What happened? Burn out?
Burn all out, did you?

05:59.609 --> 06:01.735
No, he's leaving for a better job.

06:01.903 --> 06:05.072
Oh, well, that's great.
So I guess this is, uh, goodbye then.

06:05.239 --> 06:06.740
Goodbye. Ha, ha.

06:08.910 --> 06:10.702
- Okay, then.
- Okay.

06:10.870 --> 06:12.996
Well, we're gonna
miss you around here.

06:13.456 --> 06:15.207
Yeah, me too.

06:17.502 --> 06:20.629
- So see you on Saturday.
- Yeah, you bet.

06:28.638 --> 06:29.846
Ugh.

06:39.982 --> 06:42.359
Now, you know those
are a delicacy in India.

06:43.945 --> 06:47.531
Yeah, that was Leslie calling again
to see if we can get back together.

06:47.698 --> 06:51.785
It's like the 20th time today.
Yeah, good luck, Leslie.

06:52.620 --> 06:54.621
Wow. She must've hurt you
pretty bad, huh?

06:55.123 --> 06:57.874
Well, yeah.
You know, we were best friends...

06:58.042 --> 07:01.711
...ever since we were little.
Our moms worked on the barge together.

07:02.672 --> 07:05.507
You two must've been so cute
running around on a barge.

07:05.675 --> 07:07.843
You never run on a barge.

07:10.513 --> 07:12.097
- Hey.
- Hey.

07:12.265 --> 07:13.682
Is, uh...? Is Chandler around?

07:13.850 --> 07:16.560
No, um, he met some girl
at the coffeehouse.

07:16.727 --> 07:18.311
- Ooh.
- Yeah. Ginger something.

07:18.479 --> 07:20.021
No.

07:21.274 --> 07:24.901
No, no. Uh, are you sure it wasn't
something that sounded liked Ginger?

07:25.069 --> 07:26.653
Like, uh, "Gingeer"?

07:28.197 --> 07:29.698
No, it was Ginger.

07:29.866 --> 07:32.033
I remember because
when he told me, I said:

07:32.201 --> 07:34.411
The movie star

07:35.413 --> 07:36.455
Oh, man.

07:36.622 --> 07:38.707
That's the girl I was hiding from.

07:38.875 --> 07:41.543
When she finds out he's my roommate,
she'll tell him what I did.

07:41.711 --> 07:45.755
- What did you do?
- Oh. Oh, no, no. I can't...

07:46.382 --> 07:49.092
I can't tell you that.
It's like the most awful, horrible thing...

07:49.260 --> 07:52.220
...I've ever done in my whole life.
- You know what? Don't tell us.

07:52.388 --> 07:55.015
We'll wait till Chandler gets home
because it'll be more fun.

07:55.183 --> 07:56.516
All right.

07:58.102 --> 08:00.562
Okay, it was, like, four years ago.

08:00.730 --> 08:03.773
Okay, Ginger and I had gone out
a few times. Then one weekend...

08:03.941 --> 08:05.442
...we went to her dad's cabin...

08:05.610 --> 08:09.696
...just me, her and her
annoying little dog, Pepper. Heh.

08:09.864 --> 08:12.824
Well, that night I cooked
this really romantic dinner...

08:12.992 --> 08:15.243
You gave her food poisoning.

08:15.411 --> 08:16.870
I wish. No.

08:17.747 --> 08:21.625
After dinner, me, her and Pepper
all fell asleep in front of the fire.

08:21.918 --> 08:25.587
Well, I woke up in the middle of the night
and I saw that the fire was dying out...

08:25.755 --> 08:29.090
...so I picked up a log and threw it on.

08:31.093 --> 08:32.928
Or at least what I thought was a log.

08:33.095 --> 08:35.722
Oh, my God.
You threw Pepper on the fire.

08:36.765 --> 08:38.308
I wish.

08:40.102 --> 08:43.605
See, I guess another thing I probably
should've told you about Ginger...

08:43.773 --> 08:46.650
...is that she kind of has a, uh...

08:46.943 --> 08:48.068
...artificial leg.

08:54.158 --> 08:55.825
Oh, my God.

08:56.369 --> 08:59.829
Joey. What did you do after
you threw her leg on the fire?

09:01.582 --> 09:02.624
I ran.

09:11.926 --> 09:14.261
Well, that's the best kiss I've had...

09:14.428 --> 09:16.137
...with anybody I met in a men's room.

09:17.723 --> 09:18.974
Actually, me too.

09:20.476 --> 09:22.644
Oh. Foot in a puddle.
Foot all in the puddle.

09:22.812 --> 09:25.146
Oh, damn. I hate that.

09:25.314 --> 09:27.148
We're gonna have to get you
out of those shoes.

09:27.316 --> 09:28.525
Oh, don't worry about it.

09:28.693 --> 09:32.112
- No, really. You're gonna freeze.
- No, I'm not.

09:33.823 --> 09:37.367
Huh. You're not?
What do you got, a bionic foot?

09:38.536 --> 09:40.579
Someday. Maybe.

09:51.215 --> 09:52.674
Funny book?

09:52.842 --> 09:58.138
Hmm? Oh, no, no. I'm just thinking about
something funny I heard today.

09:58.723 --> 10:02.225
Um, Mark saying, "I'll see you Saturday."

10:04.478 --> 10:05.729
Yeah, at the lecture.

10:05.896 --> 10:08.315
I told you that last week.
You said you didn't mind.

10:08.482 --> 10:12.777
Oh, no, no, no.
It's not the lecture, uh, I mind. Um...

10:12.945 --> 10:16.281
Oh, please tell me it's not because
I'm going with Mark.

10:16.866 --> 10:19.618
- Well...
- Oh, my God. Ross.

10:19.785 --> 10:22.996
Well, I'm sorry, but... Look,
if you're not working with him anymore...

10:23.164 --> 10:25.123
...why do you still have to do stuff
with him?

10:25.291 --> 10:27.083
Because he's my friend.

10:27.251 --> 10:31.463
Okay. But do you really need
another friend? I mean...

10:32.423 --> 10:37.010
Okay. Well, if I stop playing with Joey
and Chandler, can I play with Mark?

10:37.928 --> 10:40.221
Is that funny?
Am I suppose to be laughing?

10:40.389 --> 10:44.059
I don't know. You thought
"See you Saturday" was funny.

10:44.727 --> 10:46.561
Look, honey, Mark is in fashion, okay?

10:46.729 --> 10:49.397
I like having a friend
that I can share this stuff with.

10:49.565 --> 10:51.483
You guys would never
go to a lecture with me.

10:54.987 --> 10:56.571
I would love to go with you.

10:56.739 --> 10:57.864
- Really?
- Yeah.

10:58.032 --> 11:01.660
Hey, I have clothes. I even pick them out.

11:01.827 --> 11:05.121
I mean, for all you know,
I could be a fashion...

11:05.915 --> 11:06.956
...monger.

11:11.379 --> 11:15.256
Okay. Honey, I would love for you
to go with me.

11:15.549 --> 11:16.925
What?

11:17.301 --> 11:19.969
What should I wear?
Now I'm all nervous.

11:29.814 --> 11:33.149
You know, they say,
"A watched pot never beeps."

11:35.152 --> 11:38.446
It's, you know, ahem...
It's been a couple hours...

11:38.948 --> 11:40.782
...and she hasn't called.

11:41.450 --> 11:43.535
Not that I even care. I don't.

11:44.328 --> 11:46.538
Phoebe, why don't you just call her?

11:46.706 --> 11:48.790
You obviously want to.

11:48.958 --> 11:50.959
You think you know me so well.

11:51.127 --> 11:53.962
- Well, don't you wanna?
- Yeah.

11:55.131 --> 11:58.842
- Okay, so I do know you.
- That's what I said.

12:01.053 --> 12:03.596
- Well, so?
- I can't.

12:03.764 --> 12:06.057
I can't. She dumped me.

12:06.267 --> 12:08.768
I mean, I totally trusted her,
and then one day it was like:

12:08.978 --> 12:11.020
"Okay, bye, Pheebs." Gone.

12:12.648 --> 12:16.359
You know what the saddest part is?
When we were playing together...

12:16.527 --> 12:20.864
...that was like the most fun
I've ever had in, like, all my lives.

12:23.075 --> 12:27.871
My favorite shoes
So good to me, I wear them every day

12:28.038 --> 12:33.001
Down at the heel, holes in the toes
Don't care what people say

12:33.169 --> 12:36.004
My feet's best friend
Pals to the end

12:36.213 --> 12:38.840
With them, I'm one hot chickie

12:39.091 --> 12:42.552
Though late one night
Not much light

12:42.720 --> 12:46.306
I stepped in something icky

12:49.101 --> 12:51.936
Sticky shoes, sticky shoes

12:52.104 --> 12:54.647
Always make me smile

12:54.857 --> 12:59.861
Sticky shoes, sticky shoes
Next time I'll

13:00.905 --> 13:03.823
Avoid the

13:03.991 --> 13:05.700
Pile

13:14.543 --> 13:18.713
We're beginning to see a lot
of layering of sheer fabrics and colors.

13:18.881 --> 13:22.217
For instance, a sheer navy blouse
over a pink...

13:22.384 --> 13:24.969
I'm really glad we came.

13:29.725 --> 13:30.767
You're so pretty.

13:34.146 --> 13:35.897
I love you.

13:39.193 --> 13:42.195
Smelly cat, smelly cat

13:42.363 --> 13:45.406
What are they feeding you?

13:45.574 --> 13:48.535
Smelly cat, smelly cat

13:48.702 --> 13:52.914
It's not your fault

13:53.707 --> 13:54.999
Wow, that's great.

13:55.167 --> 13:58.169
- Oh, yeah?
- You know, you could totally sell this.

13:58.337 --> 14:02.257
It'd be perfect for, like, um,
a kitty-litter campaign.

14:03.092 --> 14:05.343
A jingle? No, no, no.

14:05.511 --> 14:07.178
Why not? You make a ton of money.

14:07.346 --> 14:10.849
Okay, if I was in this for the money,
I'd be a millionaire by now, you know?

14:12.601 --> 14:14.978
You gotta get out
of that jingle-head, sweetie.

14:15.980 --> 14:18.773
Ugh. You're right. You're right. I'm sorry.

14:18.941 --> 14:20.066
- That's okay.
- Okay.

14:20.234 --> 14:23.194
All right, I'm gonna play a song now
that's really, really sad.

14:23.362 --> 14:26.406
- Okay.
- Okay, it's called "Magician Box Mix-Up."

14:31.745 --> 14:34.622
Oversized bracelets,
oversized earrings...

14:34.790 --> 14:38.626
...oversizing of accessories in general
is very popular now.

14:50.180 --> 14:51.514
- Hi.
- Hey.

14:51.682 --> 14:53.558
Oh, can I borrow this?
My milk's gone bad.

14:53.726 --> 14:55.059
Oh, I hate that.

14:55.227 --> 14:58.313
I once had a thing of half-and-half.
Stole my car.

15:00.649 --> 15:03.234
So how was your date with Ginger?

15:04.570 --> 15:07.739
Great. Ahem. It was great. She's, uh...

15:07.907 --> 15:10.867
She's great. Great looking,
great personality. She's greatness.

15:12.953 --> 15:15.038
Sounds like she's got the, uh...

15:15.664 --> 15:17.332
...whole package.

15:18.792 --> 15:21.377
- Joey told you about the leg, huh?
- Uh-huh.

15:22.463 --> 15:26.174
Oh, God. It freaked me out.
Okay? I know it shouldn't have, but it did.

15:26.342 --> 15:29.177
I like her. I don't wanna stop seeing her,
but every so often, it's like:

15:29.345 --> 15:31.846
"Hey, you know what?
Where's your leg?"

15:35.267 --> 15:38.019
I mean, I'm the smallest person
in the world, aren't I?

15:38.187 --> 15:40.188
I'm the smallest person in the world.

15:40.356 --> 15:41.689
Morning.

15:41.857 --> 15:44.692
Actually, he's the smallest person
in the world.

15:50.532 --> 15:52.867
Heard about the leg-burning, huh?

15:55.412 --> 15:56.996
It came up.

15:57.581 --> 16:00.833
Ahem, listen, I, uh...
I know it's a long shot, but...

16:01.627 --> 16:04.420
...by any chance,
did she find that funny?

16:09.051 --> 16:10.802
So I nodded off a little.

16:10.970 --> 16:14.055
"Nodded off"? Ross, you were snoring.

16:14.223 --> 16:18.434
My father's boat didn't make
that much noise when it hit rocks.

16:18.602 --> 16:21.145
Come on. Forty-five minutes.

16:21.313 --> 16:25.483
Forty-five minutes, the man talked
about strappy-backed dresses.

16:26.610 --> 16:31.406
Well, okay, how about four hours
in a freezing museum auditorium...

16:31.573 --> 16:33.908
...listening to Professor Pitstains
and his:

16:34.076 --> 16:37.662
"Hey, everybody. Remember that thing
that's been dead for a gazillion years?

16:37.830 --> 16:40.873
Well, here's a little bone
we didn't know it had."

16:44.253 --> 16:48.631
First of all, it's Professor Pitain.

16:48.799 --> 16:51.426
And second of all,
that little bone proved that...

16:51.593 --> 16:54.971
...that particular dinosaur had wings
but didn't fly.

16:55.139 --> 16:57.265
Okay, you know what I just heard?

16:57.516 --> 17:01.394
Blah, blah, blah.

17:02.062 --> 17:06.607
You know what? A hundred million people
went to see a movie about what I do.

17:06.775 --> 17:11.112
I wonder how many people would go see
a movie called Jurassic Parka.

17:11.280 --> 17:13.281
Oh, that is so...

17:13.449 --> 17:15.742
No, no, no.
A bunch of out-of-control jackets...

17:15.909 --> 17:17.242
...take over an island.

17:24.542 --> 17:27.295
You know, if what I do is so lame...

17:27.463 --> 17:30.715
...then why did you insist on coming
with me this morning?

17:30.883 --> 17:33.051
Huh? Was it so
I just wouldn't go with Mark?

17:33.218 --> 17:34.385
No.

17:34.803 --> 17:38.389
I... I wanted to be with you.

17:39.058 --> 17:41.517
I don't know. I feel like lately...

17:41.685 --> 17:43.436
I feel like you're slipping away from me...

17:43.604 --> 17:46.230
...with this new job
and all these new people.

17:46.398 --> 17:49.067
And you've got this
whole other life going on.

17:49.234 --> 17:51.402
I know it's dumb...

17:51.570 --> 17:55.573
...but I just hate that I'm not a part of it.

17:59.995 --> 18:01.871
It's not dumb.

18:03.123 --> 18:06.417
But maybe it's okay
that you're not a part of it.

18:06.585 --> 18:07.752
You know what I mean?

18:09.588 --> 18:15.343
I mean, it's like I like that you're not
involved in that part of my life.

18:15.677 --> 18:17.970
That's a little clearer.

18:18.555 --> 18:21.641
Honey, see, it doesn't mean
that I don't love you...

18:21.809 --> 18:24.769
...because I do. I love you.
I love you so much.

18:24.937 --> 18:27.647
But my work, it's for me, you know?

18:27.815 --> 18:30.066
I'm out there on my own,
and I'm doing it.

18:30.234 --> 18:34.362
And it's scary,
but I love it because it's mine.

18:35.239 --> 18:37.573
But I mean, is that okay?

18:37.825 --> 18:39.867
Sure. Ha, ha.

18:49.044 --> 18:51.129
You're thinking about my leg,
aren't you?

18:51.839 --> 18:53.131
No, no.

18:53.298 --> 18:56.050
Actually, I forgot.
What is the deal with that again?

18:56.218 --> 18:59.137
Look, it's okay if it bothers you.

18:59.304 --> 19:02.140
I mean, the only thing I need to know
is how much it bothers you...

19:02.307 --> 19:04.642
...because I don't like wasting my time.

19:05.602 --> 19:06.936
Am I wasting my time?

19:07.896 --> 19:11.274
- No. No, I don't think so.
- Okay.

19:11.441 --> 19:14.819
It's just like anything else.
You just have to get used to it.

19:27.291 --> 19:28.332
What's that?

19:29.877 --> 19:31.711
That's my nubbin.

19:36.300 --> 19:37.758
What's a nubbin?

19:39.428 --> 19:43.097
It's kind of a, uh...
A third-nipple kind of thing.

19:44.600 --> 19:46.184
Do you have three nipples?

19:46.351 --> 19:48.936
Well, you know, two regulars, ahem...

19:49.104 --> 19:52.440
...and, uh, one that barely qualifies.

19:55.444 --> 19:58.112
- Uh, what?
- Nothing. I...

19:58.280 --> 20:00.448
I just remembered. I have to leave.

20:00.616 --> 20:04.035
You, uh...? You have to leave?
Now? How come?

20:04.203 --> 20:05.995
Well, it's nubbin. Nothing.

20:06.205 --> 20:11.375
Um, you know what?
I'll see you later. Okay.

20:11.793 --> 20:13.127
Uh...

20:14.713 --> 20:15.963
Ew.

20:19.301 --> 20:21.636
Oh. I thought you weren't coming.

20:21.803 --> 20:24.305
- Where were you?
- Come here. Come here.

20:24.765 --> 20:27.058
Okay. Don't get mad, okay?

20:27.226 --> 20:29.894
Okay, don't give me a reason to get mad,
okay?

20:30.562 --> 20:34.565
I played "Smelly Cat" for the people
at my old ad agency. They went nuts.

20:34.733 --> 20:38.361
No, look. I told you that I didn't want you
to try and sell it...

20:38.528 --> 20:41.697
...and you just big fat did it anyway.

20:42.991 --> 20:45.660
God. You know what?
I think, five years ago...

20:45.827 --> 20:48.496
...I probably would have done anything
to play with you.

20:48.664 --> 20:52.458
But I can do it by myself, right?
And if I can't trust you, then just forget it.

20:52.626 --> 20:54.460
No. No. I don't wanna forget it.

20:54.628 --> 20:56.337
Okay, you know what?
You have to choose.

20:56.505 --> 21:00.007
All right? If the most important thing
on the planet to you...

21:00.175 --> 21:05.179
...is this cat-poopy thing,
then, okay, you can have "Smelly Cat."

21:05.347 --> 21:07.390
But we won't be partners.

21:07.891 --> 21:09.392
So what's it gonna be?

21:09.559 --> 21:13.145
Smelly cat, smelly cat
ANNOUNCER: Odor in the litter box?

21:13.313 --> 21:16.565
Don't change your kitty.
Change your kitty litter.

21:16.733 --> 21:19.485
It's not your fault

21:21.989 --> 21:24.532
- Sorry, Pheebs.
- Yeah.

21:24.700 --> 21:26.200
You okay?

21:26.702 --> 21:28.786
Yeah. I actually am. Yeah.

21:28.954 --> 21:32.665
Because, you know, life's gonna
hand you all kinds of stuff.

21:32.916 --> 21:35.960
You know, you learn your little lessons
and hopefully you grow.

21:37.087 --> 21:38.254
You wanna hear a new song?

21:38.422 --> 21:39.714
- Yeah.
- Oh, we'd love to.

21:39.881 --> 21:41.090
Okay.

21:42.551 --> 21:44.343
Jingle bitch screwed me over

21:46.471 --> 21:48.139
Go to hell, jingle whore

21:48.307 --> 21:52.351
Go to hell, go to hell, go to hell

21:52.978 --> 21:55.062
That's all I have so far.

21:59.693 --> 22:01.152
Well, hello.

22:02.279 --> 22:04.196
- Where have you been?
- The doctor.

22:04.364 --> 22:05.698
- Is everything okay?
- Oh, yes.

22:05.866 --> 22:08.451
Just had me a little nubbin-ectomy.

22:10.912 --> 22:13.873
Yep. Two nipples, no waiting.

22:14.041 --> 22:16.709
Well. Just like Rachel in high school.

22:18.712 --> 22:19.837
What?

22:20.005 --> 22:23.799
Come on. Come on, I was kidding.
It was such an obvious joke.

22:23.967 --> 22:25.885
That was an obvious joke.

22:26.053 --> 22:28.054
And I didn't think of it.
Why didn't I think of it?

22:29.348 --> 22:31.599
The source of all my powers.

22:33.101 --> 22:35.603
Oh, dear God, what have I done?
