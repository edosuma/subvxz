"A MAN APART"

02:06.910 --> 02:12.507
<i>The Mexican cartels have</i>
<i>1,500 miles of border between them</i>

02:12.582 --> 02:15.346
<i>and the greatest drug-consuming</i>
<i>nation on earth...</i>

02:16.920 --> 02:20.014
<i>... separated</i>
<i>by a 15-foot-high fence</i>

02:20.089 --> 02:22.523
<i>which starts at the Pacific Ocean</i>

02:22.592 --> 02:25.925
<i>and travels the distance</i>
<i>of four states.</i>

02:36.940 --> 02:42.003
<i>They flood our streets,</i>
<i>day after day, week after week,</i>

02:42.078 --> 02:45.514
<i>at an average of 20 tons a month.</i>

02:45.582 --> 02:48.346
<i>That's enough to provide</i>
<i>a line of cocaine</i>

02:48.418 --> 02:51.080
<i>for every man, woman,</i>
<i>and child on this planet.</i>

03:12.842 --> 03:14.810
- Yeah?
<i>- It's me.</i>

03:14.878 --> 03:15.902
What's up?

03:15.979 --> 03:18.504
I've got tickets
to the Tuesday game.

03:18.581 --> 03:21.141
<i>- Is that right?</i>
- Row 10, seat 14.

03:21.217 --> 03:25.017
14? Oh, I'm with that!
I'll see you there.

03:25.088 --> 03:27.022
<i>From 10 tons</i>
<i>a week ago in Colombia</i>

03:27.090 --> 03:29.183
<i>to one bump tonight in L.A.,</i>

03:29.259 --> 03:31.022
<i>worlds away from the men</i>

03:31.094 --> 03:32.789
<i>who run</i>
<i>the whole goddamned show.</i>

03:53.216 --> 03:55.411
And remember, no one must
make all the arrests.

03:55.485 --> 03:57.510
We book them downtown,

03:57.587 --> 04:00.283
and the extradition will
take place from there.

04:00.356 --> 04:01.823
Are we clear?

04:01.891 --> 04:05.258
We're clear that you wouldn't be
going in there without us.

04:05.328 --> 04:06.761
You heard the man.

04:06.829 --> 04:10.026
Let's get ready to move.
Demetrius, let's have the gun.

04:11.567 --> 04:14.263
<i>- Est√° loco.</i>
- You gotta be kidding me, Frost.

04:14.337 --> 04:18.603
We are on their turf.
Isn't that right, Sean?

04:18.675 --> 04:20.005
Come on.

04:47.403 --> 04:49.701
<i>Memo Lucero was a Colombian</i>

04:49.772 --> 04:53.230
<i>who saw opportunity in Mexico's</i>
<i>northern border towns.</i>

04:53.309 --> 04:55.470
<i>He set up shop in Tijuana</i>

04:55.545 --> 04:59.037
<i>and built the busiest,</i>
<i>most lucrative drug pipeline</i>

04:59.115 --> 05:00.412
<i>the world has ever seen.</i>

05:03.486 --> 05:07.388
<i>Lucero never slept</i>
<i>in the same place twice,</i>

05:07.457 --> 05:09.721
<i>so no one</i>
<i>ever knew where he was.</i>

05:09.792 --> 05:14.593
<i>But after seven years,</i>
<i>we finally tracked him down.</i>

05:16.399 --> 05:17.491
Let's go.

05:17.567 --> 05:19.865
Frost, this is stupid.

05:19.936 --> 05:23.372
They call us down here.
They take away our weapons?

05:23.439 --> 05:25.270
They expect us to go
into a building

05:25.341 --> 05:29.175
full of drunken
cartel gunmen unarmed?

05:29.245 --> 05:30.712
I mean, that isn't fun.

05:30.780 --> 05:32.680
You're not getting paid
to have fun.

05:32.749 --> 05:34.876
Good luck, gentlemen.

05:42.992 --> 05:44.425
Bureaucrats!

05:44.494 --> 05:46.621
<i>Ay, chingado.</i>

05:46.696 --> 05:48.630
All right.

08:32.094 --> 08:33.082
Stay down!

08:46.108 --> 08:47.598
Shit!

10:22.638 --> 10:25.937
You have no idea what kind
of mistake you're making.

10:33.816 --> 10:35.374
Put your hands up!

10:35.451 --> 10:38.909
Things are only
gonna get worse, for all of us.

10:38.988 --> 10:41.047
Do me a favor
and shut the fuck up!

10:51.334 --> 10:52.699
Come on.

11:05.915 --> 11:09.009
Boss, let me go home
and see my wife.

11:09.085 --> 11:11.178
- I'll think about it.
- I can't go home and see my wife?

11:11.253 --> 11:13.744
I'll think about it!
Get out of here, you knucklehead!

11:15.091 --> 11:16.786
Hey! Good job!

11:17.860 --> 11:19.293
Damn right, good job!

11:21.097 --> 11:23.190
Seven years, dog!

11:23.265 --> 11:24.562
We got him!

11:41.283 --> 11:43.877
- Where are you?
<i>- Honey, I'm still down here.</i>

11:43.953 --> 11:47.389
- Are you okay?
<i>- Yeah, I'm okay.</i>

11:47.456 --> 11:49.219
<i>It was a little crazy,</i>

11:49.291 --> 11:52.055
<i>but I'll be home tomorrow</i>
<i>or the next day.</i>

11:52.128 --> 11:53.288
Right.

11:53.362 --> 11:54.829
<i>Baby...</i>

11:55.965 --> 11:57.626
<i>... what are you wearing?</i>

11:59.301 --> 12:01.462
One of your old jerseys.

12:03.072 --> 12:05.939
Not that blue one that you
look incredibly sexy in.

12:07.743 --> 12:10.007
Yeah, the one that
smells like you.

12:10.079 --> 12:13.344
<i>- Is that a good thing?</i>
- It's a great thing.

12:13.416 --> 12:15.611
<i>What are you doing right now?</i>

12:15.684 --> 12:17.675
Making candles.

12:17.753 --> 12:19.744
Is that pine or evergreen?

12:20.990 --> 12:22.685
Sean!

12:27.263 --> 12:29.197
It's my favorite one.

12:29.265 --> 12:30.857
Of course it is.

12:30.933 --> 12:33.367
Oh, I miss you!

12:35.004 --> 12:38.599
Two months ago,
with the arrest of Memo Lucero,

12:38.674 --> 12:41.438
we finally dealt the Pacific corridor

12:41.510 --> 12:44.377
its first substantial blow.

12:44.447 --> 12:47.177
<i>We didn't talk like cops,</i>
<i>we didn't look like cops,</i>

12:47.249 --> 12:49.274
<i>we didn't act like cops.</i>

12:49.351 --> 12:53.287
<i>For that matter, we never</i>
<i>hung out with them, either.</i>

12:53.355 --> 12:56.222
<i>We had an edge that came</i>
<i>from growing up on the streets.</i>

12:56.292 --> 12:58.089
<i>That's why were</i>
<i>the most successful</i>

12:58.160 --> 13:00.720
<i>anti-narcotics crew</i>
<i>in law enforcement.</i>

13:00.796 --> 13:05.130
We made the dent that
the naysayers said we couldn't make.

13:07.203 --> 13:11.003
<i>From this day forward,</i>
<i>things will be different.</i>

13:11.073 --> 13:13.564
<i>By taking out Lucero,</i>

13:13.642 --> 13:16.805
<i>we have cut the head</i>
<i>off the dragon.</i>

13:16.879 --> 13:20.975
<i>And now we are sending</i>
<i>an emphatic message</i>

13:21.050 --> 13:24.076
to anyone out there
who may have designs

13:24.153 --> 13:27.680
on filling the void
left by Memo Lucero.

13:27.756 --> 13:30.816
The cartels know now

13:30.893 --> 13:33.293
<i>that the U.S. Will not stand by idly</i>

13:33.362 --> 13:36.195
<i>while they pollute our shores</i>
<i>with their narcotics.</i>

13:36.265 --> 13:37.562
What's happening, homes?

13:39.635 --> 13:45.073
<i>Peace will be restored,</i>
<i>and the flow of cocaine will stop.</i>

14:08.831 --> 14:11.925
I'm happy to announce
that, effective today,

14:12.001 --> 14:16.802
their business
in Southern California is over.

14:20.843 --> 14:23.311
To the men and women
of our undercover units,

14:23.379 --> 14:26.576
enjoy the accolades,
because you've certainly earned them.

17:15.184 --> 17:17.550
They want to play in a tournament.
They want to ball against us, dog.

17:17.618 --> 17:19.143
Against who?

17:19.221 --> 17:22.156
Ramon Cardena
was killed yesterday.

17:23.224 --> 17:25.489
- Who, Lucero's guy?
- Yeah, state's attorney's.

17:25.560 --> 17:27.290
I'm not gonna shed
any tears over it,

17:27.362 --> 17:28.989
but I am concerned
about one thing...

17:29.064 --> 17:31.555
this could get a little bit messy.

17:33.702 --> 17:35.602
Frost, this is for you.

17:35.671 --> 17:38.105
It's eucalyptus, for enlightenment.

17:38.173 --> 17:40.164
Enlightenment?
Baby, he's a senior citizen.

17:40.242 --> 17:42.437
- Give him the Viagra candle.
- Sean!

17:44.246 --> 17:46.146
Big Sexy!

17:46.215 --> 17:47.204
What's up, dog?

17:47.282 --> 17:50.513
What did I tell you about smoking?

17:50.586 --> 17:51.678
I got you, dog.

17:51.754 --> 17:54.018
You don't want me to
put you in the sleeper hold.

17:54.089 --> 17:56.683
What's up with all these
damn narc cars out here?

17:56.759 --> 17:59.193
Is this a police convention?

17:59.261 --> 18:01.525
Supposed to be
a damn barbecue, dog.

18:01.597 --> 18:04.794
Believe me, you're cool here.
You're with me. It's my house.

18:04.867 --> 18:08.325
I sure hope
it's cool to go through.

18:09.905 --> 18:11.497
- Thanks.
- Hi.

18:13.575 --> 18:15.304
What's up with that?

18:17.880 --> 18:19.142
What's up, my Main D?

18:19.214 --> 18:21.307
Yo, Sexy,
what's going on, boy?

18:21.383 --> 18:23.351
Man, it's cracking out here.

18:24.620 --> 18:25.951
Check that out.

18:26.021 --> 18:27.989
- Yeah!
- Oh, my goodness!

18:29.758 --> 18:31.555
Talkin' to me!

18:31.627 --> 18:32.855
Yeah?

18:34.963 --> 18:37.124
Imagine she was like us...

18:37.199 --> 18:39.565
just wanted to fuck,
you know what I'm saying?

18:39.635 --> 18:41.899
Right here, right now.
Why can't women think like that?

18:41.970 --> 18:43.995
Sometimes a man
got to get his fuck on

18:44.072 --> 18:47.166
without love getting
in the way of it, that's all I'm saying.

18:47.242 --> 18:49.005
Can I get an amen up in here?

18:49.077 --> 18:50.840
- Amen.
- That's what I'm talking about.

18:50.913 --> 18:54.349
Now, I'm sure that my man Sean
feels the same way, right?

18:54.416 --> 18:55.678
- Yes.
- Huh?

18:55.751 --> 18:58.652
- Yes.
- Get the hell out of here!

18:58.720 --> 19:00.915
Why you trying
to do that to me?

19:00.989 --> 19:04.015
Hey, dog, his girl
got him whipped, dog, for real.

19:04.092 --> 19:07.118
- Oh, you're not whipped?
- No. I'm peeping right now.

19:07.196 --> 19:10.563
You still got the game?
Candice!

19:11.800 --> 19:13.597
No, no, I'm just joking.

19:13.669 --> 19:15.864
We're having a debate about
the survival of the species...

19:15.938 --> 19:17.235
You're having a what?

19:18.640 --> 19:20.403
Both of y'all whipped!
Look at y'all!

19:20.475 --> 19:22.670
What are you guys
talking about?

19:22.744 --> 19:24.803
You see what I'm talking about?

19:26.748 --> 19:28.181
All changed!

19:29.484 --> 19:31.418
Want to help out your pops?

19:31.486 --> 19:33.283
Give me...

19:35.324 --> 19:39.522
D.E.A., punk. Don't move,
bitch, or I'll blast you!

19:41.163 --> 19:43.154
No, that's enough of that.

19:43.232 --> 19:46.633
Don't be teaching her that
funky armlock and curse words.

19:46.702 --> 19:48.761
What?
I didn't make her do it.

19:50.172 --> 19:52.868
Hicks taught her that, not me.

19:52.941 --> 19:56.433
- You didn't teach her that?
- I just taught her to...

19:56.511 --> 20:01.107
- I love watching you with her.
- Do you?

20:01.183 --> 20:02.582
You're so sweet.

20:04.753 --> 20:06.516
Sounded rough to you?

20:06.588 --> 20:09.955
Yeah. I know you taught her that.

20:13.629 --> 20:15.062
I love you.

20:15.130 --> 20:16.620
Want me to kick everyone out?

20:18.200 --> 20:19.690
You read my mind.

20:20.903 --> 20:22.768
- Who loves you?
- You.

20:34.283 --> 20:35.910
<i>¬ø Qu√© pasa, homes?</i>

20:35.984 --> 20:36.973
What's up?

20:39.755 --> 20:41.689
What do you think, homes?

20:41.757 --> 20:42.746
What do I think?

20:49.197 --> 20:51.427
Got equipment or what, man?

20:51.500 --> 20:53.195
Good shit, man.

20:53.268 --> 20:57.932
I think we should
let the games begin.

21:18.727 --> 21:20.194
I'll take care of him.

21:47.289 --> 21:49.553
I'm so proud of you, baby.

22:19.821 --> 22:21.083
Who is it, baby?

22:22.090 --> 22:23.717
Get down!

22:24.960 --> 22:26.188
Stay down!

22:29.865 --> 22:31.730
Fuck!

22:38.774 --> 22:40.366
Hey!

22:46.014 --> 22:47.038
Hey!

22:55.157 --> 22:59.651
Hey, you fuck, you come
into my house while I sleep?

23:02.564 --> 23:04.327
You can't kill Diablo.

23:05.901 --> 23:07.892
What did you say?

23:10.572 --> 23:12.767
You cannot kill Diablo.

23:26.421 --> 23:30.016
Stace, call 9-1-1.

23:39.434 --> 23:40.662
Get up.

23:52.214 --> 23:53.203
Are you...?

23:57.919 --> 23:59.045
Baby...

24:00.455 --> 24:02.150
...I‚Äôm okay.

24:02.224 --> 24:05.625
I got 'em. I protected you.

24:07.028 --> 24:08.996
You okay?

24:09.064 --> 24:11.532
- You hit?
- I am.

24:18.907 --> 24:20.636
Honey?

24:20.709 --> 24:22.233
I'm okay.

24:28.583 --> 24:29.811
<i>9- 1-1.</i>

24:29.885 --> 24:31.853
All right, baby...

24:31.920 --> 24:33.854
Hello?

24:33.922 --> 24:35.253
...look at me.

24:36.958 --> 24:38.425
<i>Sir?</i>

24:41.930 --> 24:44.160
<i>What's the nature</i>
<i>of the emergency?</i>

24:45.233 --> 24:46.928
I'm fine.

24:50.172 --> 24:51.867
<i>What kind of assistance</i>
<i>do you require?</i>

24:51.940 --> 24:53.373
I'm okay.

24:53.441 --> 24:56.205
<i>I can't understand you, sir.</i>
<i>Can you speak up?</i>

24:56.278 --> 24:58.212
Baby...

24:58.280 --> 24:59.770
<i>Are you there, sir?</i>

25:40.021 --> 25:41.010
It's all right.

25:44.893 --> 25:46.884
Say hi to Uncle Sean.

25:46.962 --> 25:48.953
Hi, Sean.

25:52.834 --> 25:54.267
It's all right, dog.

25:55.937 --> 25:56.926
Just rest.

26:00.642 --> 26:01.768
Stacy.

26:07.882 --> 26:09.042
Stacy.

26:13.388 --> 26:14.412
Sean.

26:20.729 --> 26:21.718
Sean.

26:33.108 --> 26:34.541
Where's Stacy?

26:36.044 --> 26:38.137
Where's my wife?

26:38.213 --> 26:40.704
Look, man, um...

26:40.782 --> 26:44.513
You've been out for a while.
You lost a lot of blood.

26:52.193 --> 26:53.683
Where is she?

27:11.980 --> 27:14.244
They buried her, Sean.

27:26.561 --> 27:28.085
Where's my wife?

27:31.733 --> 27:35.169
Calm down.
Calm down, now.

27:44.913 --> 27:47.006
I've got you, man.

27:47.082 --> 27:48.845
I've got you.

27:50.418 --> 27:52.010
I'm here for you, man.

27:52.087 --> 27:56.046
Fight on, man.
We'll take care of you.

28:09.371 --> 28:10.633
Which one is it?

28:11.706 --> 28:12.764
Right over there.

30:19.667 --> 30:23.034
This prisoner is
in for two life sentences.

30:23.104 --> 30:25.368
He's got nothing to lose,
but that doesn't matter.

30:25.440 --> 30:26.839
You and I both know

30:26.908 --> 30:29.342
who this guy is
and what he is capable of,

30:29.410 --> 30:31.878
so you stay ten feet away
from him at all times,

30:31.946 --> 30:35.040
and do not touch or threaten
the prisoner at any time.

30:35.116 --> 30:37.607
- We clear?
- Clear. Open it up.

30:44.592 --> 30:46.583
You've got five minutes.

30:51.633 --> 30:54.227
You didn't expect
to see me again, did you?

30:54.302 --> 30:55.701
Ten feet, Vetter!

31:05.580 --> 31:08.606
- This good?
- Yeah.

31:10.718 --> 31:13.050
You tried to have me killed...

31:14.489 --> 31:17.219
...and you don't want
to talk to me?

31:18.793 --> 31:21.091
That's okay. I have
all the time in the world.

31:28.836 --> 31:30.497
Get him out of here!

31:30.572 --> 31:32.733
You didn't think
I was gonna get to you?

31:38.846 --> 31:40.143
Is that your family?

31:42.050 --> 31:43.540
All right, fuck the talk.

31:43.618 --> 31:45.609
Let me just ask you a question.

31:46.621 --> 31:48.612
Did you kill my wife?

31:56.464 --> 31:58.694
Did you kill my wife?

32:01.235 --> 32:03.669
Answer me, motherfucker.

32:05.873 --> 32:07.773
Answer the fucking question!

32:10.244 --> 32:12.269
Vetter, step away
from the prisoner!

32:13.748 --> 32:15.841
Vetter, damn it, I told you!

32:16.751 --> 32:18.685
Get away from him.
Get away.

32:18.753 --> 32:21.449
I was just
asking him for a smoke.

32:21.522 --> 32:23.615
Get off me.

32:24.692 --> 32:26.421
I got a smoke for you.

32:35.903 --> 32:37.632
If I wanted you dead...

32:42.110 --> 32:43.668
...you would be.

32:44.746 --> 32:47.044
That's enough.
Let's go, Vetter.

32:47.115 --> 32:48.548
Come on. Come on!

32:48.616 --> 32:49.605
Come on!

32:49.684 --> 32:50.946
Okay, okay, okay.

32:56.124 --> 32:57.887
Come on, Vetter, let's move.

32:59.260 --> 33:00.386
Come on.

33:08.436 --> 33:11.098
<i>The order to hit my home</i>
<i>had to come from the top,</i>

33:11.172 --> 33:14.835
<i>but to find that person,</i>
<i>you have to start at the bottom</i>

33:14.909 --> 33:16.843
<i>and work your way</i>
<i>up the pipeline.</i>

33:16.911 --> 33:20.369
<i>Somewhere along the line,</i>
<i>someone will talk.</i>

33:22.917 --> 33:24.680
- Yo, "T," what up?
- What's up with you?

33:24.752 --> 33:26.845
Chillin', man.
Where Sexy at?

33:26.921 --> 33:29.014
- In the house.
- Okay.

33:30.091 --> 33:31.353
Yo, Big Sexy.

33:32.427 --> 33:33.860
What's up, boy?

33:33.928 --> 33:35.225
What's up with your D-Max?

33:35.296 --> 33:37.230
- Chillin', dog.
- I'm glad you came.

33:37.298 --> 33:41.530
I didn't know y'all was rolling.
Sean. What's up, man?

33:42.770 --> 33:46.365
If you need a place to stay,
you are more than welcome.

33:46.441 --> 33:47.703
All right?

33:48.776 --> 33:51.472
Hey, man, we've got to
get at you about something.

33:51.546 --> 33:53.036
So what's up?

33:53.114 --> 33:56.049
We need to know who
out there moving major weight.

33:56.117 --> 33:57.641
What kind of weight
y'all talking about?

33:57.719 --> 34:01.450
Distribution level.
Some real shit.

34:01.522 --> 34:03.717
Guys who are hooked up
with this new network.

34:03.791 --> 34:07.318
Why you drinking out
the milk carton? Get a glass, man.

34:07.395 --> 34:08.453
Damn!

34:08.529 --> 34:10.759
Sexy, for real, man.

34:10.831 --> 34:13.391
Talkin' about this weight,
we need to know who movin' it.

34:13.467 --> 34:15.402
Those niggas
over in Ghost Town.

34:15.469 --> 34:18.438
They movin' major weight
over by that church, man.

34:18.505 --> 34:22.498
You still runnin' that dog?
You know, with your little dog?

34:22.577 --> 34:24.237
I got the dog thing goin'.

34:26.080 --> 34:28.105
Sean, I'm thinking
that could help us out.

34:29.751 --> 34:31.411
You down with
hitting them fools up?

34:31.485 --> 34:33.976
I don't care much about
them niggas on that side of town.

34:34.054 --> 34:36.922
- Let's hit 'em up.
- Yeah, like tonight.

34:36.991 --> 34:38.322
Cool.

34:38.391 --> 34:40.860
I heard you came by the hospital.

34:43.331 --> 34:44.855
Sorry, man.

34:44.931 --> 34:47.196
I appreciate that.

34:47.268 --> 34:48.667
That's cool.

34:55.676 --> 34:57.701
I'm telling you, man,

34:57.779 --> 34:59.713
we should have brought
the D.E.A. Dogs out here.

34:59.781 --> 35:01.544
Come on, D,
don't insult me like that.

35:04.051 --> 35:06.042
Capone will sniff a roach
out of the ashtray

35:06.120 --> 35:08.554
out of any damn car on the block,
you know what I'm talking about?

35:08.623 --> 35:11.114
- Well, get to sniffin'.
- Chill, chill, chill.

35:11.192 --> 35:14.593
- We ain't got all night.
- Come on, boy.

35:18.466 --> 35:20.024
Go get 'em, boy.

35:28.209 --> 35:29.870
Come on, Capone.

35:29.944 --> 35:31.138
All right, cool.

35:31.212 --> 35:32.873
Go on, baby.

35:34.282 --> 35:37.410
What's taking so long?
We ain't got all night, man.

35:43.624 --> 35:45.558
Yeah.

35:45.626 --> 35:46.820
Ain't in that one.

35:49.630 --> 35:51.154
Come on, Capone.

35:53.835 --> 35:54.859
- He got it.
- You sure?

35:54.936 --> 35:56.233
Yeah, I'm sure!

35:57.138 --> 35:59.072
He got it, man.

36:08.516 --> 36:11.508
Hey, wait a minute! Wait a minute!
What you call yourself doing?

36:11.586 --> 36:13.281
This ain't your car!
You get away from here.

36:13.354 --> 36:15.720
Easy, ma'am,
I'm just doing my job.

36:15.790 --> 36:17.849
You assholes ain't got
nothing else to do

36:17.925 --> 36:21.383
but come harass innocent,
hardworking citizens with this crap?

36:21.462 --> 36:24.022
This is an honest,
blue-collar neighborhood.

36:24.098 --> 36:25.963
Why don't you take your fat ass
up to the Palisades?

36:26.033 --> 36:27.694
They could afford to pay
those $130 tow jobs.

36:27.768 --> 36:30.430
This is an official impound.
It has five tickets.

36:30.504 --> 36:32.734
My man, we got this.
Is this your vehicle?

36:32.807 --> 36:35.708
It could be my vehicle.
Who are you supposed to be?

36:35.776 --> 36:39.177
This is who I'm
supposed to be, right here.

36:39.247 --> 36:41.807
Sexy, pop the trunk, man.

36:47.989 --> 36:50.150
Dog, what you doin'?
Pop the trunk!

36:50.224 --> 36:52.215
Hurry up!
Fuck is going on? Come on.

37:00.701 --> 37:01.998
Damn!

37:03.204 --> 37:04.728
Now, is that your shit?

37:04.805 --> 37:08.002
Is this your car or not? Is it?

37:08.075 --> 37:09.940
Come to think about it...

37:10.011 --> 37:12.912
No. That's Monroe's car.

37:12.980 --> 37:15.813
- Monroe?
- They call him Overdose.

37:15.883 --> 37:18.317
- Where he stay?
- Right over there.

37:18.386 --> 37:21.446
All right.
Go on back in the house.

37:21.522 --> 37:23.854
Ain't got
enough time for this stuff.

37:24.926 --> 37:26.416
Tow the car, nigga.

37:38.439 --> 37:39.838
Yo, Sexy,
you've got to come here.

37:39.907 --> 37:41.670
I ain't meetin' y'all
over here like this!

37:41.742 --> 37:44.768
- Sexy, roll, man.
- Careful, man.

38:23.985 --> 38:25.646
We got dope.

38:48.175 --> 38:50.006
Aw, shit! Fuck!

39:07.995 --> 39:09.553
"Diablo."

39:38.292 --> 39:39.554
Fuck!

39:48.903 --> 39:51.895
Hold your fire!
We're police officers!

39:51.972 --> 39:53.462
Get the fuck out of my house!

39:53.541 --> 39:56.339
- You got to chill!
- "Chill"? Fuck you!

40:00.314 --> 40:02.441
You want me to chill
so you can ice me?

40:02.516 --> 40:04.575
Fuck you!
Get the fuck out!

40:07.721 --> 40:13.182
Yo, listen, I said
we're police officers, so relax.

40:13.260 --> 40:14.784
We're here to help. That's all.

40:16.363 --> 40:18.126
I'm coming up, all right?

40:18.199 --> 40:20.963
Do your thing.
I'm reloading my shit.

40:21.035 --> 40:23.003
Sean, hold your fire.

40:25.706 --> 40:29.870
Now, look, man, I'm coming up,
so you've got to stop shooting.

40:33.380 --> 40:35.211
Don't try nothing, homey.

40:35.282 --> 40:37.273
Just take it easy, all right?

40:37.351 --> 40:39.319
If we were the cleanup crew,

40:39.386 --> 40:42.947
we would have finished you off
from down here, man.

40:43.023 --> 40:46.186
Wouldn't be sticking my head
in here trying to get shot.

40:47.194 --> 40:50.652
Just want to talk, all right?
Now, I'm coming up.

40:50.731 --> 40:51.720
Slow.

41:05.880 --> 41:08.246
I put my gun down, all right?

41:34.608 --> 41:36.166
I know you scared.

41:36.243 --> 41:38.541
I know you don't like the police...

41:38.612 --> 41:41.945
Damn sure talking
to a police in an attic.

41:42.016 --> 41:46.248
Back in the day,
I couldn't stand the police.

41:46.320 --> 41:48.015
They used to fuck with us
all the time.

41:48.088 --> 41:50.181
Me and my homies would be
rolling down the street.

41:50.257 --> 41:51.690
They'd pull us over jackin' fools.

41:51.759 --> 41:53.886
- You po-po.
- I know.

41:53.961 --> 41:58.022
We used to complain that police
didn't do nothing for us.

41:58.098 --> 42:00.862
And we was right, they didn't.

42:00.935 --> 42:04.632
I got tired of complaining.
I made a choice.

42:05.706 --> 42:07.298
I'm trying to help.

42:07.374 --> 42:12.812
But what you doin', man,
you ain't helpin' us.

42:14.815 --> 42:17.147
By the way things look downstairs,

42:17.218 --> 42:20.449
you need to think about
getting into a whole 'nother game.

42:22.523 --> 42:25.981
Only one alternative...
you put that gun down,

42:26.060 --> 42:29.029
or my partner downstairs,
man, trust me,

42:29.096 --> 42:31.064
he will take you out.

42:35.302 --> 42:39.432
Now, do the right thing
and just put it down.

42:48.582 --> 42:51.642
Since everything went down
with the big man,

42:51.719 --> 42:53.846
shit has been major slow,
know what I'm sayin'?

42:53.921 --> 42:56.754
He went up to,
like, $20,000 a ki.

42:56.824 --> 42:59.952
I couldn't do nothing
with that, man.

43:00.027 --> 43:02.996
This new dude was
supposed to hook me up...

43:03.063 --> 43:06.590
- Who's this new dude?
- I don't know his name.

43:06.667 --> 43:09.363
He contacted me, say he had
this, that, and the other.

43:09.436 --> 43:13.770
He said he had kis for $14,000,
so I'm thinkin' everything's velvet.

43:13.841 --> 43:15.468
- Right.
- But hell no.

43:15.542 --> 43:17.703
Then this stupid motherfucker
gonna call me back,

43:17.778 --> 43:20.542
telling me some shit about,
he want $20,000 a ki,

43:20.614 --> 43:22.343
and I got to buy it?

43:22.416 --> 43:25.351
I'm like, man, you stupid!
Who you think you talkin' to?

43:25.419 --> 43:26.716
You kiss my ass.

43:26.787 --> 43:28.311
- So what happened?
- What you mean?

43:28.389 --> 43:30.380
Why you still alive
and your homies are dead?

43:30.457 --> 43:31.890
I was in the attic.

43:31.959 --> 43:33.290
- Doin' what?
- Hidin'.

43:33.360 --> 43:35.225
What kind of coward shit
is that, man?

43:35.296 --> 43:37.025
You see homey
in there in that chair

43:37.097 --> 43:39.565
with his tongue
pulled through his neck?

43:40.634 --> 43:44.001
You'd better get real.
Reflexes too slow.

43:44.071 --> 43:46.039
Enough of the bullshit, dog.

43:47.274 --> 43:49.367
The name... the new guy,
what is his name?

43:49.443 --> 43:52.378
I ain't tellin' y'all shit else.
Nothin' else.

43:52.446 --> 43:54.038
I'm cool with y'all.

43:54.114 --> 43:55.741
These motherfuckers ain't no joke!

43:55.816 --> 43:58.478
They would scalp me and send
my braids to my momma!

43:58.552 --> 44:01.453
What y'all gonna do,
take me to jail?

44:01.522 --> 44:03.319
Take me, then.
I'm cold anyway.

44:03.390 --> 44:05.483
Give me a fuckin' coat.
Put me in the car.

44:07.561 --> 44:09.825
We got us a hardhead right now.

44:09.897 --> 44:12.365
- You sure about that?
- Actin' like you want to, man.

44:12.433 --> 44:13.923
You're not gonna
tell us anything else?

44:14.001 --> 44:15.025
Nothing else!

44:17.137 --> 44:19.605
- You don't want to talk anymore?
- He ain't gonna talk.

44:19.673 --> 44:22.574
You sure about that?

44:24.078 --> 44:25.170
Here you go.

44:25.245 --> 44:28.510
You think you a player
'cause you got an S600?

44:28.582 --> 44:32.348
Not because of those
wack-ass dubs on that piece of shit.

44:32.419 --> 44:34.114
Oh, yeah.

44:34.188 --> 44:37.021
Does he think 'cause of this tatt
he's a gangster?

44:37.091 --> 44:38.285
Get your hands off me.

44:38.359 --> 44:40.122
Not 'cause of
the played-out platinum.

44:40.194 --> 44:42.788
You don't think you're
crossing them over, do you?

44:42.863 --> 44:45.957
Back in the day,
I would have taken this from you.

44:46.033 --> 44:49.298
You think you're a man because
you move a ki here and there.

44:49.370 --> 44:52.737
That ain't weight! Did he think
that was weight in that piece of shit?

44:54.775 --> 44:56.743
Let me tell you something...

44:56.810 --> 44:59.244
the real motherfuckers
don't move a ki here and there.

44:59.313 --> 45:01.645
They move
50 metric tons a month!

45:03.050 --> 45:04.312
I'm gonna ask you...

45:04.385 --> 45:06.148
Get your gun
out of my face, man.

45:07.221 --> 45:08.779
Okay.

45:09.723 --> 45:11.418
We'll do it like this.

45:15.496 --> 45:16.986
Okay.

45:19.700 --> 45:23.101
Now, I'm gonna ask you
one more time.

45:23.170 --> 45:24.831
What's the name?

45:28.542 --> 45:30.669
I don't know their name!
Hey, man!

45:32.179 --> 45:34.807
I'm gonna ask you again.
What the fuck is his name?

45:34.882 --> 45:36.179
Hey, man!

45:36.250 --> 45:38.946
- What's up with your people?
- What's the fucking name?

45:40.587 --> 45:41.986
I don't know, man!

45:42.055 --> 45:43.852
Motherfucker named
Hollywood Jack, man!

45:43.924 --> 45:45.687
Hollywood Jack, man.
My name Monroe Johnson.

45:45.759 --> 45:48.125
I don't want no problems
with y'all, man.

45:48.195 --> 45:50.186
The rest of the dope
in the gray Monte Carlo.

45:50.264 --> 45:52.425
We got it, man. Come on.

45:55.102 --> 45:59.368
We got ten pages on this thing,
all from the same number...

45:59.440 --> 46:02.102
Soleil Tanning Salon.

46:02.176 --> 46:04.041
Tanning salon?

46:04.111 --> 46:06.306
You know damn well
you don't need no tan.

46:38.145 --> 46:39.134
Whoa!

46:40.981 --> 46:42.539
Slow down!

46:42.616 --> 46:44.174
I think that's him.

46:44.251 --> 46:45.809
<i>Looks Hollywood to me.</i>

46:56.163 --> 46:57.926
<i>Yeah, that's definitely him.</i>

46:57.998 --> 47:01.593
Ricky Martin, move over.
Here comes Hollywood Jack.

47:01.668 --> 47:02.692
Hold on.

47:04.505 --> 47:06.439
Yeah, we got you.

47:06.507 --> 47:07.804
All right, I'm back.

47:07.875 --> 47:09.433
Yeah, all right.

47:09.510 --> 47:11.569
Yeah, I can do that for you.

47:11.645 --> 47:13.135
Yeah, okay.

47:16.049 --> 47:17.482
Yeah. Good-bye.

47:20.888 --> 47:22.321
Hello. How's it going?

47:22.389 --> 47:23.720
Good. Hey...

47:24.558 --> 47:26.822
...how long has that clown
in the truck been out there?

47:26.894 --> 47:28.657
I don't know.

47:41.441 --> 47:43.272
<i>I'm gonna check him out.</i>

47:43.343 --> 47:46.244
- Just go easy, all right?
<i>- I'm just gonna talk to him.</i>

47:58.158 --> 48:00.558
Let's make this quick.

48:01.628 --> 48:04.756
- I like this car.
- Hey, nice truck.

48:04.831 --> 48:05.957
Thanks.

48:06.033 --> 48:08.797
In fact, I was thinking
about trading this one in

48:08.869 --> 48:10.803
for, like, seven of those.

48:10.871 --> 48:12.133
Really?

48:12.205 --> 48:14.469
I like it better than the S600.

48:15.842 --> 48:18.777
Let me get your license
and registration, please.

48:18.845 --> 48:21.609
May I ask what I did?

48:21.682 --> 48:25.311
Yeah, your mud flaps.
You got no mud flaps on this.

48:25.385 --> 48:27.615
It's a fuckin' Porsche.

48:27.688 --> 48:30.657
You won't have to worry
when you trade it for the truck.

48:30.724 --> 48:33.090
And you're parked
in a handicapped spot.

48:33.160 --> 48:34.252
Did you know that?

48:34.328 --> 48:36.489
Oh, really? No!

48:36.563 --> 48:37.928
Aw, shit!

48:37.998 --> 48:40.899
- You can get out of your car.
- Thank you.

48:43.604 --> 48:45.765
<i>Beverly Hills dispatch.</i>

48:45.839 --> 48:49.536
2-1-6. Run this plate
for me real quick.

48:49.610 --> 48:51.544
You can go ahead and get out.

48:51.612 --> 48:56.345
Number
4-queen-david-apple-4-8-6.

48:56.416 --> 48:57.440
<i>Stand by.</i>

48:57.517 --> 48:59.849
I said get out of the car.

48:59.920 --> 49:01.285
This is fucking ridiculous!

49:01.355 --> 49:02.947
When in the history of mankind

49:03.023 --> 49:06.015
has anyone been harassed
for their fuckin' mud flaps?

49:06.093 --> 49:07.617
Watch your language.

49:07.694 --> 49:09.685
Oh, I'm sorry.
Let me rephrase.

49:09.763 --> 49:11.321
Fuck you!

49:13.934 --> 49:15.299
Aw, shit.

49:17.137 --> 49:18.695
God!

49:20.807 --> 49:22.798
I'm out, I'm out!

49:22.876 --> 49:24.537
Damn! Chill, dog.

49:24.611 --> 49:26.010
What does the name
Overdose mean to you?

49:26.079 --> 49:28.513
- Over who?
- Overdose!

49:28.582 --> 49:30.709
There's a human being
named Overdose?

49:30.784 --> 49:32.046
Answer the fucking question.

49:32.119 --> 49:33.882
<i>2- 19-54.</i>

49:34.955 --> 49:37.480
What the hell is a 2-1-9-5-4?

49:37.557 --> 49:39.320
<i>Subject has</i>
<i>a warrant for jaywalking.</i>

49:39.393 --> 49:41.190
Jaywalking?

49:41.261 --> 49:45.254
Tell me why you paged
some drug trafficker ten times.

49:45.332 --> 49:46.993
I didn't page anyone.

49:47.067 --> 49:50.764
That's your salon, right?
The calls came from your salon.

49:51.838 --> 49:54.671
Ninety percent of
my clients do narcotics,

49:54.741 --> 49:56.834
and they all use that phone.

49:56.910 --> 49:59.435
I don't know.

49:59.513 --> 50:02.004
Why would Overdose
refer to you as his supplier?

50:02.082 --> 50:03.845
You're Hollywood Jack,
aren't you?

50:03.917 --> 50:07.512
- Come again?
- Hollywood Jack.

50:07.587 --> 50:11.523
My civil rights are being violated
'cause some jig drug dealer

50:11.591 --> 50:14.560
named Overkill or Oreo
or whatever the fuck his name is

50:14.628 --> 50:16.858
mentioned a guy
named Hollywood Jack?

50:19.433 --> 50:21.924
Call my lawyer, you cocksucker!

50:22.002 --> 50:24.197
Call your lawyer?

50:25.539 --> 50:26.528
God!

50:27.874 --> 50:29.569
Can you guys see this?

50:29.643 --> 50:32.271
You don't know who that is?
I'll call your lawyer.

50:32.345 --> 50:35.314
I'll beat the shit out of him
after I beat the fuck out of you!

50:35.382 --> 50:37.213
What the fuck
does Overdose mean to you?

50:37.284 --> 50:39.218
What are you doing, man?
You've got to chill.

50:39.286 --> 50:40.878
Damn! Chill, boy!

50:40.954 --> 50:44.014
Get the fuck back in the car!

50:44.091 --> 50:45.991
What's wrong with you, man?
People could be videotaping!

50:46.059 --> 50:47.321
Chill out!

50:47.394 --> 50:49.089
Get back in the car, man!

50:49.162 --> 50:51.892
All we got on this guy
is a warrant for jaywalking.

50:51.965 --> 50:53.557
That's it.

50:53.633 --> 50:56.329
That's all we got...
a fuckin' jaywalking ticket!

50:56.403 --> 50:59.634
Yo, Hollywood, how'd you know
Overdose is black?

50:59.706 --> 51:01.071
What?

51:01.141 --> 51:03.905
Correct me if I'm wrong,
but you called him a "jig," right?

51:03.977 --> 51:06.741
Don't stupid fucks like you
call black people "jigs"?

51:08.148 --> 51:09.172
You fucked up.

51:09.249 --> 51:13.515
My lawyer is gonna have
a field day with you, psycho fuck!

51:13.587 --> 51:16.750
Your lawyer?
I'll strike him, too!

51:18.759 --> 51:20.021
Is there a problem?

51:20.093 --> 51:22.027
Get back in the fuckin' salon.

51:22.095 --> 51:24.188
Everything's okay.
Everything's fine.

51:24.264 --> 51:26.027
Can I help you with something?

51:26.099 --> 51:29.034
Get in your truck, man!
Everything is fine.

51:29.102 --> 51:31.195
Get the fuck
in the truck, man. Damn!

51:50.290 --> 51:52.383
Hey, sleepyhead!

51:52.459 --> 51:54.222
What the fuck, homey?

51:54.294 --> 51:56.228
I just want... whoa!

51:56.296 --> 51:58.230
I was crashed out, man.

51:58.298 --> 52:00.732
I'm sorry, man.
I just wanted to ask a question.

52:00.801 --> 52:03.736
Could I get a beer or something?

52:05.238 --> 52:06.830
Yeah, get a beer, man.

52:06.907 --> 52:07.896
Okay.

52:07.974 --> 52:09.839
What were you doing
down at the salon

52:09.910 --> 52:13.402
paging some ghetto rat's
crack pad, like, ten times?

52:13.480 --> 52:14.879
I fucked up.

52:14.948 --> 52:17.678
Oh, no, hey, fuck it.
Don't worry about it.

52:17.751 --> 52:19.514
It's no big deal.

52:19.586 --> 52:21.520
But...

52:21.588 --> 52:25.183
what is a big deal is,
I spent my afternoon with cops...

52:25.258 --> 52:27.658
specifically, the cop
you were supposed to take out.

53:02.062 --> 53:03.461
Stupid ass.

55:19.899 --> 55:21.389
When I was little...

55:23.136 --> 55:26.401
...my brothers and sisters and me...

55:27.574 --> 55:29.599
...we all slept in the same room.

55:29.676 --> 55:34.375
There was no electricity,
dirt floors.

55:34.447 --> 55:36.745
When it would rain...

55:38.084 --> 55:42.578
...we couldn't sleep 'cause
the raindrops on the tin roof

55:42.655 --> 55:44.850
were too loud.

55:44.924 --> 55:48.018
What did you
call me down here for?

55:48.094 --> 55:50.619
I might be able to help you.

55:52.198 --> 55:54.257
You had your chance to talk to me.

56:00.106 --> 56:02.574
They killed my wife...

56:04.611 --> 56:07.239
...and my son.

56:22.896 --> 56:24.989
When there's a change at the top,

56:25.065 --> 56:29.399
they start over,
build their own pipeline.

56:30.403 --> 56:32.633
They'll be looking for new buyers.

56:33.740 --> 56:36.800
So if you could come up
with enough money,

56:36.876 --> 56:39.242
you'll flush him out.

56:39.312 --> 56:45.410
I can't do anything about him,
but you can.

56:50.990 --> 56:52.457
Romans.

57:30.730 --> 57:33.722
Come on, baby, slide over here!

57:45.245 --> 57:47.179
We've been hurting for product

57:47.247 --> 57:49.340
ever since these fuckers
took down the sale.

57:50.917 --> 57:53.681
And you hear all this
stupid shit about Diablo.

57:53.753 --> 57:55.516
I don't want any part of Diablo.

57:55.588 --> 57:58.182
I just need to get
back to business.

57:58.258 --> 58:01.022
Diablo's been pulling
some bold fuckin' moves.

58:01.094 --> 58:02.618
He's been clipping
the lower-level guys,

58:02.695 --> 58:03.957
cutting 'em clean out.

58:04.030 --> 58:06.464
Bam! Gone!
Streamlinin' the pipeline.

58:06.533 --> 58:09.730
Now, with us, they've got to
walk on eggshells.

58:09.802 --> 58:12.134
They fuck with us,
they got problems in the jails.

58:12.205 --> 58:15.368
We'll kick their wetback ass
in every jail in the state.

58:15.441 --> 58:17.671
It's like
an insurance policy for 'em...

58:17.744 --> 58:20.372
we get Central and NorCal,
they get SoCal. Simple.

58:20.446 --> 58:23.210
Don't worry about us.
We don't deal with California.

58:23.283 --> 58:24.409
Right.

58:32.492 --> 58:35.620
You're looking at a shipment
like that every month.

58:39.632 --> 58:41.691
He can do 18 per.

58:41.768 --> 58:43.736
Eighteen? You gotta be
kidding me, man.

58:43.803 --> 58:45.998
- What?
- You're wasting my time.

58:47.207 --> 58:50.142
All right, all right. Wait up.

58:50.210 --> 58:52.974
- Sixteen.
- Sixteen?

58:53.046 --> 58:55.037
I can't believe I just said that.

58:55.114 --> 58:58.208
- Who pays them prices, cops?
- You got some nuts on you.

58:58.284 --> 59:00.548
You want to do business
with me or not?

59:00.620 --> 59:04.215
Aw, fuck, man,
you're killing me here.

59:04.290 --> 59:07.623
All right, look, we can do fifteen.

59:07.694 --> 59:10.925
You know how fuckin' tight
it's been around here.

59:10.997 --> 59:14.125
Anything less than fifteen,
I'm cuttin' my own throat!

59:20.506 --> 59:22.940
We could do fifteen.

59:23.009 --> 59:24.977
All right. Jesus!

59:25.044 --> 59:27.979
Hey, guys.
Want a dance, honey?

59:28.047 --> 59:29.514
No, thanks.

59:30.583 --> 59:34.485
Joe, buy him a dance.
We need to loosen him up.

59:35.588 --> 59:38.216
He's so... serious.

59:39.225 --> 59:41.216
Get the fuck off my lap.

59:42.929 --> 59:44.260
Fuck you!

59:45.198 --> 59:47.530
You should have
more respect for yourself.

59:47.600 --> 59:49.534
What's your deal, bro?
You a faggot?

59:54.274 --> 59:55.639
What did you just say to me?

59:58.578 --> 01:00:00.978
You call me a fuckin' faggot?

01:00:03.049 --> 01:00:07.008
What the fuck you standing up for?
We got a problem here?

01:00:15.061 --> 01:00:16.187
The fuck you looking at?

01:00:20.733 --> 01:00:22.633
There's not a problem.

01:00:27.907 --> 01:00:29.534
Come on, sit down.

01:00:30.109 --> 01:00:31.599
You kill me, man.

01:00:33.913 --> 01:00:36.245
I'm hoping
you're a good businessman,

01:00:36.316 --> 01:00:39.717
'cause if you are, there's
a whole lot more business for you.

01:00:39.786 --> 01:00:41.651
There's nobody else
out there right now.

01:00:41.721 --> 01:00:43.916
But don't ever talk to me
like that again.

01:00:43.990 --> 01:00:48.757
Don't ever try to disrespect me.
I don't care who is around.

01:00:48.828 --> 01:00:52.195
Where I'm from, you talk like that,
you get punched in the face.

01:00:52.265 --> 01:00:54.165
It's just business.

01:00:57.570 --> 01:01:01.836
Now, look, here's the deal...
you get a car, something clean,

01:01:01.908 --> 01:01:04.900
meet me 2:00 Friday
at Utro's by the harbor,

01:01:04.977 --> 01:01:06.501
right there near berth 73.

01:01:06.579 --> 01:01:09.013
My people will be there.
You switch keys with them...

01:01:38.711 --> 01:01:40.770
<i>- Who loves you?</i>
<i>- You.</i>

01:02:02.535 --> 01:02:07.632
The man that runs this organization
calls himself Diablo.

01:02:07.707 --> 01:02:10.403
This man is Jack Slayton.

01:02:10.476 --> 01:02:12.569
Everything we have leads to him.

01:02:14.647 --> 01:02:16.512
What the fuck are you reading?

01:02:16.582 --> 01:02:19.483
Does that have anything to do
with what we were talking about?

01:02:19.552 --> 01:02:21.816
If you don't want
to be here, get out!

01:02:24.991 --> 01:02:26.253
Get on with it.

01:02:30.763 --> 01:02:32.594
The second move...

01:02:33.599 --> 01:02:37.467
The second big move is to flood
the whole entire West Coast

01:02:37.537 --> 01:02:40.631
with more coke
than we've ever seen before

01:02:40.706 --> 01:02:42.674
in a straight-up hostile takeover.

01:02:42.742 --> 01:02:44.767
If that happens, we're
right back where we started.

01:02:46.279 --> 01:02:48.008
We shouldn't have
gone to Mexico.

01:02:49.081 --> 01:02:50.605
We can do this.

01:02:50.683 --> 01:02:52.548
We can shut them down
before they become

01:02:52.618 --> 01:02:54.347
the next dominant cartel.

01:02:56.422 --> 01:02:58.447
It's very important to me.

01:02:58.524 --> 01:02:59.957
They're ruthless.

01:03:02.295 --> 01:03:04.729
Come into your fuckin' home.

01:03:23.416 --> 01:03:24.678
<i>This is Mobile One.</i>

01:03:24.750 --> 01:03:27.218
<i>Approaching</i>
<i>entry point unsecured.</i>

01:03:29.622 --> 01:03:30.884
How's it going?

01:03:30.957 --> 01:03:31.946
Good.

01:03:32.024 --> 01:03:34.015
Where's your clowns?

01:03:34.093 --> 01:03:36.084
They wanted to
meet up with you later, man.

01:03:36.162 --> 01:03:37.891
You all set?

01:03:39.999 --> 01:03:41.864
Yeah, I like these rims.

01:03:41.934 --> 01:03:44.494
Yeah, thanks, man. Pull in.

01:03:44.570 --> 01:03:47.198
<i>I got the all right.</i>
<i>Everybody in place?</i>

01:03:47.273 --> 01:03:49.673
<i>We got Mobile Two</i>
<i>on the waterfront. That's covered.</i>

01:03:52.945 --> 01:03:55.505
<i>Exit road is secure.</i>

01:03:57.483 --> 01:04:00.247
<i>This is C.R. Team,</i>
<i>behind Utro's. Got it covered.</i>

01:04:01.821 --> 01:04:03.550
There's your boy.

01:04:17.470 --> 01:04:18.960
How you doin'?

01:04:29.482 --> 01:04:31.973
Just making sure
you're not wired, that's all.

01:04:36.889 --> 01:04:40.347
What are you doing?
I'm not wired, man!

01:04:40.426 --> 01:04:42.087
That's what every cop says.

01:04:42.161 --> 01:04:43.219
Hey...

01:04:45.231 --> 01:04:46.755
Where do I know you from?

01:04:46.832 --> 01:04:48.299
You don't know me.

01:04:49.735 --> 01:04:51.600
You want to do business or not?

01:04:58.978 --> 01:05:02.345
- Is that all of it?
- All there, to the penny.

01:05:02.415 --> 01:05:03.973
You're lucky, you know.

01:05:04.050 --> 01:05:06.314
Yeah, I'm lucky
to be back in business.

01:05:07.653 --> 01:05:09.814
We're taking over the corridor.
You know that, don't you?

01:05:09.889 --> 01:05:11.481
Anybody who fucks with Diablo...

01:05:13.025 --> 01:05:14.925
Come on. Fuck.

01:05:14.994 --> 01:05:17.155
Remember that cop
who took down the big man?

01:05:17.229 --> 01:05:19.493
We took care of
his stupid bitch wife.

01:05:21.901 --> 01:05:24.301
So you took care of
his stupid bitch wife?

01:05:27.607 --> 01:05:29.837
Any bitch who marries a cop
has got to be stupid.

01:05:29.909 --> 01:05:31.809
The keys are in the car.
Take care.

01:05:35.581 --> 01:05:37.845
You killed my wife,
you motherfucker?

01:05:38.551 --> 01:05:39.984
Damn!

01:05:40.052 --> 01:05:41.280
<i>Red is on waterfront.</i>

01:05:42.622 --> 01:05:44.214
Get in here!

01:05:47.093 --> 01:05:48.390
You mother!

01:05:49.929 --> 01:05:51.692
<i>Hold on.</i>

01:05:51.764 --> 01:05:53.891
<i>We've got</i>
<i>an L.A. Sheriff's unit coming in.</i>

01:05:56.035 --> 01:05:58.128
<i>Think we ought to move in?</i>

01:05:58.204 --> 01:06:01.867
<i>- Stay in place.</i>
<i>- This one ours?</i>

01:06:01.941 --> 01:06:03.135
<i>That's not our guy.</i>

01:06:03.209 --> 01:06:05.541
<i>I repeat, that is not our guy.</i>

01:06:07.613 --> 01:06:09.638
<i>Negative!</i>
<i>It's not one of ours!</i>

01:06:09.715 --> 01:06:11.046
<i>Move in!</i>

01:06:13.452 --> 01:06:14.646
Fuck!

01:06:31.137 --> 01:06:33.765
<i>Code 13!</i>
<i>We've got an officer down!</i>

01:06:33.839 --> 01:06:36.364
Fuckin' son of a bitch!

01:06:44.984 --> 01:06:46.110
Fuck!

01:06:48.854 --> 01:06:50.344
Fuckin' monkey cocksucker!

01:06:50.423 --> 01:06:51.947
Fuck you!

01:06:56.195 --> 01:06:58.186
Motherfucker!

01:07:13.212 --> 01:07:14.611
Oh, shit!

01:10:10.322 --> 01:10:12.449
Boss, you wanted to see me?

01:10:12.524 --> 01:10:14.219
Yeah, Sean, come in.
Sit down.

01:10:22.668 --> 01:10:24.135
Sean, you're done.

01:10:25.704 --> 01:10:28.605
- Boss, it was a setup.
- It was a disaster.

01:10:29.642 --> 01:10:31.633
You lost it
in the middle of an operation,

01:10:31.710 --> 01:10:33.940
and now
three officers are dead.

01:10:38.117 --> 01:10:39.379
Boss, I'm sorry.

01:10:39.451 --> 01:10:42.909
I know I fucked up,
but you can't take away my...

01:10:42.988 --> 01:10:44.819
This is all I have left.

01:10:44.890 --> 01:10:46.721
I'm sorry, too, Sean.
I'm sorry about...

01:10:46.792 --> 01:10:49.420
I'm very sorry about Stacy...

01:10:51.463 --> 01:10:53.488
She was like a daughter to me.

01:10:53.565 --> 01:10:57.001
What you need is
some time to grieve.

01:10:57.069 --> 01:10:59.560
You're going to take six months.

01:10:59.638 --> 01:11:02.505
We'll do a psych evaluation
at the end of that time,

01:11:02.574 --> 01:11:04.735
and then we'll see
where we're at.

01:11:14.086 --> 01:11:16.714
I remember
when you gave me this.

01:11:16.789 --> 01:11:18.780
How proud it made me.

01:11:18.857 --> 01:11:22.657
You said I was part of the family.

01:11:32.371 --> 01:11:33.929
I grieve every day.

01:11:35.274 --> 01:11:38.266
You know what it's like not being
able to go into your own home?

01:11:41.447 --> 01:11:43.779
I don't know
what the hell I'm doing.

01:11:49.621 --> 01:11:51.418
This takes time.

01:11:52.958 --> 01:11:54.289
Yo, Sean.

01:11:56.628 --> 01:11:58.459
Yo, man,
what the hell was that?

01:12:08.073 --> 01:12:10.439
They said it was a setup.

01:12:12.511 --> 01:12:13.910
What do you think?

01:12:26.925 --> 01:12:29.723
I let my emotions take over.

01:12:29.795 --> 01:12:32.286
I lost it out there.

01:12:32.364 --> 01:12:35.527
I can't help this anymore.
They took my badge.

01:12:35.601 --> 01:12:39.059
You're beating against
a billion-dollar business.

01:12:40.139 --> 01:12:43.870
You alone are trying
to bring down a monster.

01:12:43.942 --> 01:12:45.637
As a cop, that's impossible.

01:12:46.645 --> 01:12:49.273
You must become a monster.

01:12:57.289 --> 01:13:00.087
She must have been
a good woman.

01:13:00.159 --> 01:13:02.559
She was a wonderful woman.

01:13:07.232 --> 01:13:08.597
And a wonderful wife.

01:13:09.668 --> 01:13:11.693
Met her when I was 15.

01:13:13.705 --> 01:13:15.832
I don't know what
would have happened to me

01:13:15.908 --> 01:13:17.432
if she hadn't come into my life.

01:13:19.211 --> 01:13:21.202
She was all I ever had.

01:13:31.090 --> 01:13:35.151
What's the one thing a man
like me won't touch in this business?

01:13:35.227 --> 01:13:39.095
The end product, the end result.

01:13:41.433 --> 01:13:42.593
The money.

01:13:42.668 --> 01:13:45.660
I know where the money
is being safe-housed.

01:13:45.737 --> 01:13:48.934
You'll have to follow it to Mexico.

01:13:49.007 --> 01:13:52.443
But in Mexico, you'll be alone.

01:13:54.513 --> 01:13:56.947
But you must give me your word
you'll get me out of here.

01:13:59.685 --> 01:14:01.676
I'm not safe here.

01:14:03.188 --> 01:14:05.383
I need a transfer.

01:14:09.228 --> 01:14:11.389
Tell me where it is.

01:14:36.922 --> 01:14:41.154
- You haven't painted this place yet?
- You sound like Candice.

01:14:41.226 --> 01:14:44.923
I'm gonna come by this weekend
with a couple of cans of paint.

01:14:44.997 --> 01:14:46.862
What's going on, man?

01:14:46.932 --> 01:14:51.369
I just staked out the place.
I need four guys.

01:14:51.436 --> 01:14:52.869
Staked out what place?

01:14:52.938 --> 01:14:55.202
I found out where the money is.

01:14:55.274 --> 01:14:58.072
Sean, you should let
the department handle this.

01:14:58.143 --> 01:14:59.872
I'm gonna be back for you
in a little while.

01:14:59.945 --> 01:15:02.436
You should really
let Frost handle this.

01:15:02.514 --> 01:15:04.448
Have you
seen Rachel anywhere?

01:15:04.516 --> 01:15:06.746
I haven't seen her.
She's probably in the house.

01:15:06.818 --> 01:15:08.217
All right.

01:15:13.192 --> 01:15:15.126
She doesn't want me here?

01:15:16.195 --> 01:15:18.925
Things ain't been
so cool around here.

01:15:20.232 --> 01:15:22.530
You know when we came
to visit you in the hospital?

01:15:22.601 --> 01:15:24.296
That freaked Rachel out.

01:15:24.369 --> 01:15:27.167
She asked me
when was daddy next

01:15:27.239 --> 01:15:29.104
to be laid up there in the hospital,

01:15:29.174 --> 01:15:31.904
tubes all in my face
and my chest.

01:15:31.977 --> 01:15:34.571
I'm sorry
about the family thing.

01:15:35.814 --> 01:15:37.941
Big Sexy's in.

01:15:38.016 --> 01:15:39.176
Sexy?

01:15:40.752 --> 01:15:42.447
You went and got Se...

01:15:42.521 --> 01:15:44.182
No. Let me
tell you something, man.

01:15:44.256 --> 01:15:46.121
We ain't no gangbangers no more.

01:15:46.191 --> 01:15:48.125
I know we're not gangbangers.

01:15:48.193 --> 01:15:50.161
Then what's with Sexy?

01:15:50.229 --> 01:15:52.629
I'm using
whatever resources I have.

01:15:52.698 --> 01:15:54.598
Let me tell you something...

01:15:54.666 --> 01:15:56.531
I just came here to get you.

01:15:56.602 --> 01:15:59.298
I'm gonna be back later.
We'll work this out.

01:15:59.371 --> 01:16:02.738
Don't bother to come and get me.
I'm not rollin'.

01:16:02.808 --> 01:16:05.675
That's right. You fuckin' up.
You out of control, man.

01:16:05.744 --> 01:16:06.938
How am I fuckin' up?

01:16:07.012 --> 01:16:08.604
Everything you do is messy,

01:16:08.680 --> 01:16:10.944
and I got to clean up
after your sloppy ass.

01:16:11.016 --> 01:16:13.507
But that's not my fault
if somebody gets out of line.

01:16:13.585 --> 01:16:15.576
I'm not fuckin' with you.

01:16:15.654 --> 01:16:19.112
How could you turn your back on me,
as long as we been rolling together?

01:16:19.191 --> 01:16:21.921
You fuckin' up, and I'm
not about to risk my family!

01:16:21.994 --> 01:16:24.758
What the fuck would you do?
Ask yourself that.

01:16:24.830 --> 01:16:27.424
You talk about the hospital,
the nightmares.

01:16:27.499 --> 01:16:29.399
What would you do if she died?

01:16:50.422 --> 01:16:52.856
<i>Hi. You've reached</i>
<i>the Vetter residence.</i>

01:16:52.924 --> 01:16:54.516
<i>We can't get</i>
<i>to the phone right now.</i>

01:16:54.593 --> 01:16:56.026
<i>Sean, knock it off!</i>

01:16:56.094 --> 01:16:58.358
<i>We're a little busy,</i>
<i>but we'll call you back.</i>

01:16:58.430 --> 01:16:59.419
<i>Thanks.</i>

01:17:00.932 --> 01:17:03.696
<i>Yo, Sean, it's "D." Pick up.</i>

01:17:04.770 --> 01:17:05.862
<i>Yo, Sean.</i>

01:17:07.205 --> 01:17:09.799
<i>Yo, man, trust me,</i>

01:17:09.875 --> 01:17:12.810
<i>you gotta think this through</i>
<i>before you make a move.</i>

01:17:12.878 --> 01:17:15.813
<i>I'm tellin' you,</i>
<i>think it over, man.</i>

01:17:16.882 --> 01:17:18.110
<i>You hear me?</i>

01:17:51.917 --> 01:17:53.407
Yo, Sean, what up?

01:17:58.757 --> 01:18:00.850
You got all your people here?

01:18:00.926 --> 01:18:01.950
Man, we ready.

01:18:02.027 --> 01:18:05.190
Yo, you don't have to
go through with this.

01:18:05.263 --> 01:18:08.255
This is how we roll.
Stacy was like family.

01:18:08.333 --> 01:18:11.131
Plus I got some new shit
I want to test out.

01:18:36.328 --> 01:18:39.559
I can't let you
roll without me, man.

01:18:46.238 --> 01:18:48.069
It's on, dog.

01:18:48.140 --> 01:18:50.131
I got some extra vests in the car.

01:18:52.144 --> 01:18:53.839
Let's move!

01:19:22.841 --> 01:19:25.435
Get the fuck down!

01:19:25.510 --> 01:19:28.308
Get the fuck down!
Everybody stay down!

01:19:28.380 --> 01:19:29.904
The fuck...?

01:19:31.516 --> 01:19:32.710
Move!

01:19:34.085 --> 01:19:36.019
Move! Move!

01:19:36.087 --> 01:19:39.215
Stay down! Stay down!

01:19:39.291 --> 01:19:40.485
Move!

01:19:40.559 --> 01:19:42.823
You thought I wasn't
gonna find you?

01:19:42.894 --> 01:19:44.862
The fuck, man?

01:19:44.930 --> 01:19:46.363
Get up, fucker!

01:19:47.532 --> 01:19:49.295
Stay down!

01:19:52.571 --> 01:19:56.007
- Yo, watch these motherfuckers!
- I got these motherfuckers!

01:20:01.046 --> 01:20:02.070
When are you
dropping the money?

01:20:02.147 --> 01:20:03.341
I don't know.

01:20:05.150 --> 01:20:07.084
When are you dropping
the fuckin' money?

01:20:07.152 --> 01:20:09.586
- Soon as I make the call!
- Get up!

01:20:12.791 --> 01:20:16.318
Make the fuckin' call.
Use the satellite phone.

01:20:17.395 --> 01:20:19.260
God damn!

01:20:19.331 --> 01:20:20.662
Hurry up, man!

01:20:20.732 --> 01:20:23.257
And don't try that smuggler talk.
I speak it fluently.

01:20:29.941 --> 01:20:31.568
New York Pizza.

01:20:31.643 --> 01:20:34.111
Yeah, we're having a party.
I'd like to order some pizza.

01:20:34.179 --> 01:20:36.010
Cheer the fuck up!

01:20:36.081 --> 01:20:37.708
<i>You want it right now?</i>

01:20:37.782 --> 01:20:39.409
Party already started.

01:20:39.484 --> 01:20:41.611
We've got some really
hungry people here.

01:20:41.686 --> 01:20:44.246
That's just excellent.
What would you like on your pie?

01:20:44.823 --> 01:20:46.256
Everything.

01:20:49.761 --> 01:20:51.558
Is that gonna be cash,
check, or charge?

01:20:51.630 --> 01:20:53.791
Cash, check, or charge?

01:20:56.401 --> 01:20:57.561
Cash.

01:20:57.636 --> 01:20:58.796
<i>What's your location?</i>

01:20:58.870 --> 01:21:00.804
Devil's Playground.

01:21:00.872 --> 01:21:03.432
That's gonna take a little
longer than 30 minutes.

01:21:03.508 --> 01:21:05.271
I'll see you there.

01:21:27.432 --> 01:21:29.627
Ladies and gentlemen,

01:21:29.701 --> 01:21:31.362
please put your seatbacks
and tray tables

01:21:31.436 --> 01:21:32.926
Into their upright position.

01:21:34.272 --> 01:21:36.365
We are about to make
our final descent

01:21:36.441 --> 01:21:40.241
into the middle
of fuckin' nowhere.

01:22:11.242 --> 01:22:12.903
<i>¬ø Qu√© pasa, Joe?</i>

01:22:14.946 --> 01:22:17.676
Is this fuckin' beautiful or what?

01:22:17.749 --> 01:22:22.482
I think I'm gonna open a salon
three miles north of here,

01:22:22.554 --> 01:22:24.488
'cause people
all around the world, Joe,

01:22:24.556 --> 01:22:26.183
they just want to look pretty.

01:22:27.525 --> 01:22:29.459
'Cept for you, of course.

01:22:30.595 --> 01:22:33.393
Don't move, Joe. I'll get the door.

01:22:45.944 --> 01:22:48.640
Man, I don't know
how you stayed alive this long.

01:22:48.713 --> 01:22:50.578
Get the fuck in the car!
Get in the car!

01:22:50.649 --> 01:22:51.741
All right! Jesus!

01:22:51.816 --> 01:22:53.875
Big Sexy, get rid of him
and come back for the truck!

01:22:53.952 --> 01:22:55.351
See ya, Joe.

01:22:57.155 --> 01:22:58.918
So you're not a hairdresser.

01:22:58.990 --> 01:23:01.356
You tellin' me this punk is Diablo?

01:23:01.426 --> 01:23:04.327
- Whoa. I'm not Diablo, man.
- Shut up.

01:23:04.396 --> 01:23:07.832
No, he's not Diablo,
but he's gonna take us to Diablo.

01:23:07.899 --> 01:23:10.663
Yeah, I'm gonna
take you guys to Diablo...

01:23:10.735 --> 01:23:12.396
or not.

01:23:15.774 --> 01:23:18.174
What are you gonna do, man?
You gonna shoot me?

01:23:18.243 --> 01:23:20.006
Fuck you!
You're not gonna do shit!

01:23:20.078 --> 01:23:22.603
Push comes to shove,
you're just a fuckin' cop!

01:23:23.682 --> 01:23:24.876
What did you say?

01:23:24.949 --> 01:23:27.281
Don't bury me! Come on!

01:23:27.352 --> 01:23:29.912
Don't want to
tell the truth, do you?

01:23:29.988 --> 01:23:32.252
Okay, bad fuck!

01:23:32.323 --> 01:23:34.553
So you say
you never seen him before?

01:23:34.626 --> 01:23:37.288
I've never seen him.
I don't know his name.

01:23:37.362 --> 01:23:40.297
- But you ran drugs for him.
- That's the way it works.

01:23:40.365 --> 01:23:42.026
He's fuckin' lying.

01:23:42.100 --> 01:23:43.533
...the way it works!

01:23:43.601 --> 01:23:46.263
Assuming this worked,
what was gonna happen next?

01:23:51.342 --> 01:23:54.778
Assuming this worked,
what was gonna happen next?

01:23:54.846 --> 01:23:57.041
The airstrip...

01:23:57.115 --> 01:23:58.377
Stop.

01:23:59.451 --> 01:24:01.544
They have a house
south of the border.

01:24:01.619 --> 01:24:05.077
I drop the cash, I just walk.

01:24:05.156 --> 01:24:07.750
It would have been a done deal.

01:24:07.826 --> 01:24:09.225
It's still gonna be.

01:24:19.370 --> 01:24:21.998
Sean, money's ready.

01:24:25.810 --> 01:24:27.607
When we get there,

01:24:27.679 --> 01:24:30.512
you keep that personality thing
going, all right?

01:24:31.583 --> 01:24:32.948
You understand me?

01:25:01.713 --> 01:25:03.374
<i>¬ø Qu√© pasa, fellas?</i>

01:25:05.850 --> 01:25:10.810
Oh, just "turbulencia,"
you know.

01:25:21.332 --> 01:25:22.731
Get that for you.

01:25:28.706 --> 01:25:30.731
Oh! I didn't tell you?

01:25:30.809 --> 01:25:32.902
My girlfriend
lives near the airstrip.

01:25:32.977 --> 01:25:37.471
Yeah. And we went to the Red
over there in Barstow...

01:25:37.549 --> 01:25:41.542
Some drinks...
Cerveza, nachos,

01:25:41.619 --> 01:25:43.177
couple of laughs.

01:25:46.791 --> 01:25:48.554
You guys need to relax.

01:25:52.730 --> 01:25:53.856
No, you got to...

01:26:35.907 --> 01:26:37.204
Damn!

01:27:10.208 --> 01:27:12.199
Let's go! Let's go!

01:27:19.384 --> 01:27:20.817
Straight ahead.

01:27:20.885 --> 01:27:22.375
They stopped.

01:27:30.228 --> 01:27:32.662
I thought we
closed this place down, man.

01:27:32.730 --> 01:27:35.130
I know a way in.

01:28:09.901 --> 01:28:12.199
We separate,
we meet back here.

01:29:40.124 --> 01:29:41.557
Shut up!

01:29:56.641 --> 01:29:58.506
I'm going left.

01:29:58.576 --> 01:30:01.511
Yo, man,
if anything happens to you...

01:30:01.579 --> 01:30:03.171
I'm going left.

01:30:06.184 --> 01:30:08.618
Nothing's gonna happen.
You're going home.

01:30:58.803 --> 01:31:00.236
Diablo.

01:31:04.075 --> 01:31:06.873
So this is what
the devil looks like.

01:31:12.950 --> 01:31:14.042
Why?

01:31:16.120 --> 01:31:18.179
Why'd you take my wife?

01:31:18.256 --> 01:31:20.190
You think I am the one.

01:32:22.820 --> 01:32:24.981
You should have stayed
out of Mexico,

01:32:25.056 --> 01:32:28.719
and perhaps your wife
would still be alive.

01:33:59.650 --> 01:34:01.242
Die!

01:35:20.898 --> 01:35:21.887
Come on.

01:35:21.966 --> 01:35:23.831
Let's go.

01:35:23.901 --> 01:35:25.732
It's not over.

01:35:29.907 --> 01:35:32.000
Sean, come on! Keep moving!

01:35:32.076 --> 01:35:33.668
Stay with me. Come on.

01:35:33.744 --> 01:35:35.006
Stay with me.

01:35:35.079 --> 01:35:36.740
Shit! Come on.

01:35:39.417 --> 01:35:42.909
Keep moving!
Come on. Let's go.

01:35:45.956 --> 01:35:48.424
<i>From the wreckage,</i>
<i>officials believe</i>

01:35:48.492 --> 01:35:50.687
<i>the gunmen attacked</i>
<i>with semiautomatic weapons,</i>

01:35:50.761 --> 01:35:52.695
<i>killing two</i>
<i>Bureau of Prisons officers</i>

01:35:52.763 --> 01:35:54.355
<i>and injuring several others.</i>

01:35:54.432 --> 01:35:56.366
<i>The specifics are being withheld</i>

01:35:56.434 --> 01:35:58.527
<i>until the investigation</i>
<i>is complete,</i>

01:35:58.602 --> 01:36:00.536
<i>but we believe that</i>
<i>the gunmen were able</i>

01:36:00.604 --> 01:36:02.970
<i>to spring cartel leader</i>
<i>Memo Lucero,</i>

01:36:03.040 --> 01:36:05.304
<i>who was serving</i>
<i>two life sentences</i>

01:36:05.376 --> 01:36:08.368
<i>for a string of murders</i>
<i>and trafficking of narcotics.</i>

01:36:08.446 --> 01:36:10.141
<i>The prisoner</i>
<i>was being transferred</i>

01:36:10.214 --> 01:36:12.546
<i>to a maximum</i>
<i>security prison outside L.A.</i>

01:36:12.616 --> 01:36:14.311
<i>I signed the transfer.</i>

01:36:14.385 --> 01:36:17.479
It is not your fault
that Lucero busted out, okay?

01:36:17.555 --> 01:36:19.648
<i>Yeah,</i>
<i>but I recommended it.</i>

01:36:19.723 --> 01:36:22.817
They say he's
somewhere in Mexico, man.

01:36:22.893 --> 01:36:25.327
<i>He's not in Mexico,</i>
<i>Demetrius.</i>

01:36:25.396 --> 01:36:26.829
How do you know that?

01:36:26.897 --> 01:36:29.832
<i>I'm taking Frost's advice.</i>
<i>I'm taking a little time.</i>

01:36:29.900 --> 01:36:31.697
Sean, where you at?

01:36:31.769 --> 01:36:35.000
Don't worry. I'm in a good place.
I'm recovering.

01:36:35.072 --> 01:36:37.006
<i>Just give me</i>
<i>a call soon, all right?</i>

01:36:37.074 --> 01:36:38.098
Okay.

01:39:53.504 --> 01:39:56.371
This will only take a second.

01:39:59.243 --> 01:40:01.234
I got all the time in the world.

01:40:02.946 --> 01:40:05.574
I tracked you for seven years.

01:40:07.251 --> 01:40:09.742
You never went
to the same place twice.

01:40:11.522 --> 01:40:13.080
Until you came home.

01:40:14.158 --> 01:40:16.092
I told you you had no idea

01:40:16.160 --> 01:40:18.094
what you were
getting yourself into.

01:40:20.164 --> 01:40:22.257
If you'd stayed
out of my business,

01:40:22.332 --> 01:40:24.232
your wife would still be alive.

01:40:28.706 --> 01:40:32.437
Your arrogance killed her,
not me.

01:40:33.444 --> 01:40:35.810
Like your arrogance coming here!

01:40:35.879 --> 01:40:41.283
Do you think you can come
into my domain and kill me?

01:40:58.302 --> 01:41:02.796
If I wanted you dead,
you would be.

01:41:19.056 --> 01:41:21.081
Finish the job.

01:42:59.523 --> 01:43:02.219
I know that you're
with me in spirit.

01:43:10.067 --> 01:43:12.058
But I still miss you.

01:43:32.823 --> 01:43:34.017
You okay?

01:43:41.565 --> 01:43:43.032
Who picked the stone?

01:43:44.101 --> 01:43:45.693
We all did.

01:43:45.769 --> 01:43:47.862
Yeah, she would have
liked that.
