WEBVTT

00:10.034 --> 00:11.344
- Oh.

00:11.413 --> 00:12.793
Uh, good morning.

00:12.862 --> 00:14.517
- Good morning, Liza.
This is Beth.

00:14.586 --> 00:16.655
- Hi! It's so nice
to meet you, Beth.

00:16.724 --> 00:19.793
- Likewise. I finally get
to meet the roommate.

00:19.862 --> 00:20.793
Yoga at 10:00?

00:20.862 --> 00:22.137
- Yeah.
- Okay.

00:22.206 --> 00:24.586
- Bye.
- Mm.

00:24.655 --> 00:26.379
- Uh, is that the
vagina counselor?

00:26.448 --> 00:28.758
- Yes.
We just finished a session.

00:28.827 --> 00:30.965
- Ugh.

00:31.034 --> 00:32.551
And now you're doing yoga.

00:32.620 --> 00:34.310
Wow. I don't even
know you anymore.

00:34.379 --> 00:35.793
- Oh, we hardly ever
see each other,

00:35.862 --> 00:37.517
I mean, now
that we're all boo'd up.

00:37.586 --> 00:39.517
We should have
a little double date--

00:39.586 --> 00:40.965
me and Beth, you and Charles.

00:41.034 --> 00:42.275
- Yeah, I just--

00:42.344 --> 00:44.068
- I promise
not to call him Chaz.

00:44.137 --> 00:46.068
- No, it's not that.
It's just...

00:46.137 --> 00:47.655
I'm worried that he...

00:47.724 --> 00:50.413
He might be secretly
funding a new company.

00:50.482 --> 00:52.586
- Chaz?
- I know it sounds crazy.

00:52.655 --> 00:55.137
It's just, there are a lot,
like, of odd coincidences.

00:55.206 --> 00:56.482
Like, he recently took out

00:56.551 --> 00:58.482
a huge mortgage
on his town house.

00:58.551 --> 01:00.137
- Well, he's going
through a divorce.

01:00.206 --> 01:01.482
He probably needs the cash.

01:01.551 --> 01:02.931
- I know. You're right.
- Yeah.

01:03.000 --> 01:04.862
- But I--also, I saw him
meeting with Zane.

01:04.931 --> 01:06.206
- Mm-hmm.

01:06.275 --> 01:07.517
- And now this
new publishing company

01:07.586 --> 01:09.206
with Zane in charge
buys a book

01:09.275 --> 01:10.482
right out
from under Millennial.

01:10.551 --> 01:13.206
- Eh. Sounds random.

01:13.275 --> 01:14.448
But if you're looking
for trouble,

01:14.517 --> 01:15.827
you're probably
going to find it.

01:20.862 --> 01:22.379
- Okay. Marketing.

01:22.448 --> 01:24.862
I was allotting a certain budget
for Audrey Colbert's advance,

01:24.931 --> 01:26.689
but now that we don't
have that anymore,

01:26.758 --> 01:28.724
what do we have to promote?

01:28.793 --> 01:31.413
- Bronwyn Madigan just finished
the final pass on her new book.

01:31.482 --> 01:33.379
- "The Seasoned Slut"?
Really?

01:33.448 --> 01:35.482
- Well, I mean, the main
character's a chef

01:35.551 --> 01:38.241
and also older...and a slut.

01:38.310 --> 01:39.413
- Oh.
- There's a great recipe

01:39.482 --> 01:41.137
for meatloaf in the back.

01:41.206 --> 01:42.655
- It's erotica
for baby boomers.

01:42.724 --> 01:44.310
Her books did well
for Empirical.

01:44.379 --> 01:47.103
Maybe Millennial makes
a bigger push to show

01:47.172 --> 01:49.655
that a female-run company
supports our female authors.

01:49.724 --> 01:52.586
- Okay, let's just make sure
that she re-ups her contract.

01:52.655 --> 01:54.689
- As the boss,
I suggest you make that happen.

01:54.758 --> 01:59.172
She's a cash cow, and...
Millennial could use the milk.

01:59.241 --> 02:00.896
- Did you have to say that?

02:00.965 --> 02:02.448
- I did.

02:05.551 --> 02:07.103
- Look at this.

02:07.172 --> 02:10.000
- He always looks like a dog
that just ate your pizza.

02:10.068 --> 02:11.862
- We need to make sure
that we have the funds in place

02:11.931 --> 02:14.241
to compete with him
and whoever's backing this.

02:14.310 --> 02:15.965
- Do you think that
it could be, like,

02:16.034 --> 02:17.965
one really rich person?

02:18.034 --> 02:19.620
-  No way.

02:19.689 --> 02:21.620
I found out that Mercury
has offices

02:21.689 --> 02:23.103
in the Financial District.

02:23.172 --> 02:25.793
It's got to the some
deep-pocketed media company

02:25.862 --> 02:28.000
who has the resources
to play in publishing.

02:28.068 --> 02:29.379
- Yeah, that sounds right.

02:29.448 --> 02:31.103
- I'm going to lunch,
and on my way,

02:31.172 --> 02:33.413
I'm going to pay Zane a little
surprise visit

02:33.482 --> 02:37.000
and find out how big of a
problem he's actually gonna be.

02:39.620 --> 02:41.965

03:09.655 --> 03:12.275
What is this?

03:12.344 --> 03:14.586
- Welcome to Mercury.

03:14.655 --> 03:16.793
- This is a community
workspace.

03:16.862 --> 03:19.241
This is where you go if
you're starting a taco pop-up.

03:19.310 --> 03:21.517
- This is the future
of business.

03:21.586 --> 03:23.413
There's no overhead,
and I take all my meetings

03:23.482 --> 03:24.793
at Suffolk House.

03:24.862 --> 03:26.724
- Is that how you got
Audrey Colbert?

03:26.793 --> 03:28.931
A nice breakfast
and a big check?

03:29.000 --> 03:32.586
- Oh, money isn't everything.
Sometimes it's about charm.

03:32.655 --> 03:34.896
So you slept with her?

03:34.965 --> 03:37.448
God, that is
completely unethical...

03:37.517 --> 03:38.724
and so creepy.

03:38.793 --> 03:40.655
- Oh, but it's fine
when you do it?

03:40.724 --> 03:43.965
- I've only slept with my
authors after they signed.

03:44.034 --> 03:46.034
- Mm.
- Is that what this is about?

03:46.103 --> 03:47.620
You getting back at me?

03:47.689 --> 03:49.793
You went after Audrey
because you knew I was.

03:49.862 --> 03:51.655
- You lost the book, Peters.
Suck it up, all right?

03:51.724 --> 03:53.551
There will be others--

03:53.620 --> 03:55.620
oh, if they don't all
get snatched up by me first.

03:55.689 --> 03:58.448
- This isn't cute, Zane.

03:58.517 --> 04:00.827
That book was important to me,
and you know it.

04:00.896 --> 04:03.551
You could've been up front,
but you played me.

04:12.172 --> 04:13.862
- Listen, you are energetically
inflamed, all right?

04:13.931 --> 04:18.172
Your aura is like a cartoon bird
that just ate a pepper.

04:18.241 --> 04:19.758
- I am stressed, okay?

04:19.827 --> 04:22.724
And my quick, easy way
to de-stress was Zane,

04:22.793 --> 04:24.758
and I hate him now.

04:24.827 --> 04:27.793
- Okay, okay, let's, um--let's
redirect some of that heat

04:27.862 --> 04:29.551
before I have to take one
for the team, all right?

04:29.620 --> 04:31.034
Pull up your apps, Kels.

04:31.103 --> 04:32.137
We can find you

04:32.206 --> 04:33.758
some no-strings-attached
love tonight.

04:33.827 --> 04:35.586
- Okay, well, it's going
to take a second

04:35.655 --> 04:37.172
because I just added them
back on the train.

04:37.241 --> 04:39.896
- Um, that is not
how dating apps work, babe.

04:39.965 --> 04:41.586
Yeah, you--your profile
doesn't come down

04:41.655 --> 04:43.413
just because you delete
the app off your phone.

04:43.482 --> 04:45.517
The bait has been in the water.

04:45.586 --> 04:47.448
- Then how come
I don't have any bites?

04:47.517 --> 04:49.586
- I don't know. Give.

04:49.655 --> 04:51.931
Oh, Kelsey, no, no, no.

04:52.000 --> 04:55.413
This says that you're
Publisher of Millennial Print.

04:55.482 --> 04:58.137
Yeah. That is my job.

04:58.206 --> 05:00.965
- Yes. And it is a great job,
and I am in constant awe

05:01.034 --> 05:03.448
of your accomplishments,
but this kind of overachieving

05:03.517 --> 05:05.206
only works if you're trying
to pick up women, all right?

05:05.275 --> 05:07.586
Men don't want to deal
with your big-dick energy.

05:07.655 --> 05:09.137
- Oh, my God. Okay.

05:09.206 --> 05:11.275
I don't have that energy,
and you're shouting.

05:11.344 --> 05:13.448
- You have BDE, Kelsey.
You do.

05:13.517 --> 05:14.793
I mean,
you are basically wielding

05:14.862 --> 05:16.310
a giant psychic schlong.

05:16.379 --> 05:18.034
I almost got us a three-top.

05:18.103 --> 05:20.620
- I don't have
big-dick energy, okay?

05:20.689 --> 05:22.689
There's just something wrong
with my app.

05:22.758 --> 05:23.965
- Yes, okay,
and I will show you.

05:24.034 --> 05:26.241
I'll show you what
is wrong with your apps.

05:31.000 --> 05:32.586
- What is a creative director?

05:32.655 --> 05:35.413
- No one knows, okay?
And no one cares.

05:35.482 --> 05:37.586
Oh!

05:37.655 --> 05:39.206
What was that?

05:39.275 --> 05:41.172
Did someone get a ding?

05:47.275 --> 05:48.758
- Liza!

05:48.827 --> 05:50.689
I just got off the phone
with a rep from MetroCycle.

05:50.758 --> 05:53.862
I pitched them the idea of
putting erotica on the kiosks.

05:53.931 --> 05:56.172
- Bronwyn's?
- No, my own.

05:56.241 --> 05:57.827
Yes, Bronwyn's!

05:57.896 --> 05:59.655
We are working out a deal where
excerpts from her book appear

05:59.724 --> 06:01.379
on every kiosk
from April to June--

06:01.448 --> 06:02.793
a sign that spring has sprung.

06:02.862 --> 06:05.379
- Oh, we could call
the campaign

06:05.448 --> 06:07.551
"Get On and Get Off."

06:07.620 --> 06:09.172
- That's disgusting.

06:09.241 --> 06:10.241
Maybe.

06:10.310 --> 06:11.896
Call Bronwyn,
give her the headline,

06:11.965 --> 06:13.827
see if that spurs her on
to sign the contract.

06:19.793 --> 06:21.206
- Hi.
- Thanks for helping out.

06:21.275 --> 06:23.724
- Yeah, of course.
Hi, baby girl. How are you?

06:23.793 --> 06:26.034
Oh, yeah.
- I have to crash this program.

06:26.103 --> 06:28.068
- Okay.
- It's only gonna take

06:28.137 --> 06:29.931
a couple of days.

06:30.000 --> 06:31.344
I pumped.

06:31.413 --> 06:33.517
Put half in the fridge,
half in the freezer.

06:33.586 --> 06:35.000
- All right.

06:35.068 --> 06:36.862
Oh, hey, hey.

06:36.931 --> 06:39.172
Hey, what's going on,
baby girl?

06:39.241 --> 06:41.862
- She's probably just hungry.
- We okay?

06:41.931 --> 06:44.034
- She's hungry all the time.

06:44.103 --> 06:45.206
- Okay.

06:45.275 --> 06:46.758
Ooh.

06:46.827 --> 06:49.517
Okay.

06:54.137 --> 06:55.862
- Oh.

06:55.931 --> 06:58.206
Ow.
- Ow? What?

06:58.275 --> 07:01.551
- Oh, nothing. It's fine.
- That doesn't sound fine.

07:01.620 --> 07:03.689
What can I do to help?
- Uh...

07:03.758 --> 07:05.137
- What's happening?

07:05.206 --> 07:08.206
- Ah, I think I just have
a clogged duct.

07:08.275 --> 07:09.448
It's fine. Ah!

07:09.517 --> 07:11.793
- Oh.

07:13.689 --> 07:15.620
I'm so sorry.

07:15.689 --> 07:18.379
I guess it's unclogged.

07:19.517 --> 07:23.689
- I don't know, something
natural, easy, a little sexy.

07:23.758 --> 07:24.896
- Of course.

07:24.965 --> 07:27.137
You going out tonight?
- Yes.

07:27.206 --> 07:29.655
Tonight I'm practicing
a little self-care

07:29.724 --> 07:31.103
with someone else.

07:31.172 --> 07:32.724
- Okay!

07:32.793 --> 07:35.931
Well, one tip for keeping this
blowout fresh--no missionary.

07:36.000 --> 07:38.275
- Oh, no problem.

07:38.344 --> 07:40.137
I like you.

07:40.206 --> 07:42.310
- My roommate says
I need to tone it down.

07:42.379 --> 07:45.655
She claims I have BDE.
- Big-dick energy?

07:45.724 --> 07:47.586
- According to her.
- Uh-oh.

07:47.655 --> 07:50.551
- Yeah. Uh, apparently it's
a turn-off if you're a woman--

07:50.620 --> 07:52.103
- Did you know
you had a patch?

07:52.172 --> 07:56.068
- What's that?
- You've lost some hair here.

07:57.862 --> 08:00.689
- Oh, my God.

08:00.758 --> 08:03.172
I don't have
big-dick energy.

08:03.241 --> 08:06.482
I have bald-dude energy!
Aah!

08:09.586 --> 08:10.965
- ♪ Hush now, baby,
don't you cry ♪

08:11.034 --> 08:14.413
♪ It's time for us
to say good-bye ♪

08:14.482 --> 08:15.793
- Hey.

08:15.862 --> 08:17.827
Does this hat look ridiculous?
- Shh!

08:17.896 --> 08:19.103
- I've tried
putting my hair up.

08:19.172 --> 08:20.758
I've tried putting
a bandanna on.

08:20.827 --> 08:22.068
- Kelsey, Kelsey,
I really don't want to hear

08:22.137 --> 08:23.655
about your
bad hair day, okay?

08:23.724 --> 08:25.482
I-I have been up all night
with a crying baby.

08:25.551 --> 08:26.896
Why? I don't know.
I don't know.

08:26.965 --> 08:28.482
Because the rest of you
either don't have ears

08:28.551 --> 08:29.827
or you don't have souls.

08:29.896 --> 08:31.482
- It is not a bad hair day,
Lauren.

08:31.551 --> 08:34.482
My hair's falling out!
- Okay, well, animals shed.

08:34.551 --> 08:35.931
You're just blowin' coat.
It's normal.

08:36.000 --> 08:37.586
- I am not a sheltie!

08:37.655 --> 08:40.655
I've lost four clumps of hair
since last night. Four!

08:40.724 --> 08:43.793
I'm going to the doctor to see
if he can put them back in!

08:43.862 --> 08:44.965
Oh, my God!

08:45.034 --> 08:46.793
- What happened?

08:46.862 --> 08:48.344
What happened?
Did she wake up?

08:48.413 --> 08:50.379
- No, Josh. You are the only
one who just woke up, okay?

08:50.448 --> 08:53.275
I mean, get it together, man!
Kelsey doesn't need this!

08:53.344 --> 08:55.034
She's got a bag full of hair!

09:07.068 --> 09:09.793
- Kelsey.

09:09.862 --> 09:11.172
- Bronwyn Madigan is
coming in today,

09:11.241 --> 09:12.620
and we need
to put on a show,

09:12.689 --> 09:14.034
which you can be
the ringleader of

09:14.103 --> 09:17.000
since you're
wearing a top hat?

09:17.068 --> 09:19.206
- What's going on?
- She won't sign her contract.

09:19.275 --> 09:21.620
I thinks she just needs some
face time with the new boss.

09:21.689 --> 09:22.931
Make sure she's in good hands.

09:23.000 --> 09:25.172
- So I'd re-think
the Sorting Hat.

09:25.241 --> 09:27.551
- Some of my hair...

09:27.620 --> 09:30.034
has recently gone.

09:30.103 --> 09:32.000
The doctor says
that it's alopecia.

09:32.068 --> 09:33.689
- Oh, my God!
Are you okay?

09:33.758 --> 09:36.000
- I had alopecia...
not on my head.

09:36.068 --> 09:38.206
I've also had
stress-induced dermatitis,

09:38.275 --> 09:39.896
three bulging disks,

09:39.965 --> 09:41.931
and something quaintly referred
to as "nutcracker's esophagus."

09:42.000 --> 09:43.724
Oh, and every April
I get shingles,

09:43.793 --> 09:45.379
right up the side
of my rib cage.

09:45.448 --> 09:47.034
It's like wearing
an electric tube top

09:47.103 --> 09:48.586
one month out of the year.

09:48.655 --> 09:50.172
- That's not
making me feel better.

09:50.241 --> 09:52.000
- It's making me feel better.

09:52.068 --> 09:55.275
Look, eventually the pendulum
swings the other way.

09:55.344 --> 09:57.551
In the meantime, just...

09:57.620 --> 10:00.241
hang in there.

10:03.793 --> 10:05.862
- Can I take anything
off your plate?

10:05.931 --> 10:08.275
- Just keep an eye out, okay?

10:08.344 --> 10:09.517
- Okay.

10:12.896 --> 10:16.103
- MetroCycle
has 62,000 riders a day,

10:16.172 --> 10:18.344
which guarantees
at least that many

10:18.413 --> 10:20.379
the chance to marinate
in your words

10:20.448 --> 10:23.000
as they get on and get off.

10:23.068 --> 10:24.827
- Gross.

10:24.896 --> 10:26.275
- I agree. It's...

10:26.344 --> 10:29.000
- You know, it's a great
marketing opportunity.

10:29.068 --> 10:31.551
And it's perfect for the release
of "The Seasoned Slut."

10:31.620 --> 10:32.931
- It's not my demo.

10:33.000 --> 10:35.586
Women my age
don't ride MetroCycle.

10:35.655 --> 10:36.827
- I'm not so sure about that.

10:36.896 --> 10:39.379
- Do you ride MetroCycle?

10:39.448 --> 10:40.896
- Funny story, I--

10:40.965 --> 10:43.103
Am I your demographic?

10:43.172 --> 10:45.793
- We want to introduce
new readers to your books.

10:45.862 --> 10:48.586
- I'm good. New readers can
find me in the Twittersphere.

10:48.655 --> 10:50.310
I'm a big tweeter.

10:50.379 --> 10:54.034
I don't want to sign
with a company called Millennial

10:54.103 --> 10:56.517
and have my voice reimagined
for a new audience.

10:56.586 --> 10:58.344
- Oh, Bronwyn.
I promise you,

10:58.413 --> 11:01.137
we don't want to chance
your voice or your books.

11:01.206 --> 11:03.448
- You say that now,
but I've been around the block.

11:03.517 --> 11:07.137
When you sign a contract,
you sign your rights away.

11:07.206 --> 11:08.482
I'm not going to re-up, ladies.

11:08.551 --> 11:10.862
I just thought I owed you
the face-to-face.

11:10.931 --> 11:12.896
- You've built
your entire career here.

11:12.965 --> 11:15.758
- No, I built my career
at Empirical...

11:15.827 --> 11:18.517
where I met you
as an assistant.

11:18.586 --> 11:20.034
- So your problem is with me?

11:20.103 --> 11:22.758
- No, my problem is
with the lack of value

11:22.827 --> 11:24.758
placed on experience.

11:24.827 --> 11:26.655
Where's the gray hair
in the room?

11:26.724 --> 11:30.448
I write erotic fiction
for women of a certain age.

11:30.517 --> 11:31.965
Yeah...

11:32.034 --> 11:35.275
I bet any man would let
the two of you blow him.

11:35.344 --> 11:36.620
- "Let"?

11:36.689 --> 11:39.310
- Women my age
have to work hard for that BJ,

11:39.379 --> 11:41.241
and we are better at it.

11:41.310 --> 11:43.689
Am I right?

11:43.758 --> 11:45.965
- Do people think I'm her age?

11:55.655 --> 11:57.310
- Maggie.

11:57.379 --> 11:58.862
- Oh, hey!

11:58.931 --> 12:00.620
I came all the way
to Greenpoint

12:00.689 --> 12:02.000
so that I wouldn't run
into anybody.

12:02.068 --> 12:03.379
- Yeah, me too.

12:03.448 --> 12:05.206
I'm balding.

12:05.275 --> 12:06.586
Yeah.

12:06.655 --> 12:09.172
I think it's work-related.
I don't know.

12:09.241 --> 12:10.827
- Well, itching and burning
over here.

12:10.896 --> 12:12.620
You know, this new woman
I'm seeing, Beth--

12:12.689 --> 12:14.310
she's got me
doing so much hot yoga

12:14.379 --> 12:16.172
that my cooch
finally had enough.

12:16.241 --> 12:17.896
There's a cure for that.

12:17.965 --> 12:20.344
The grass is always greener.

12:20.413 --> 12:22.034
Hey, why don't you
come over for a drink

12:22.103 --> 12:23.896
and a home-cooked meal?

12:23.965 --> 12:25.655
You can meet Beth.
I mean, she's a naturopath.

12:25.724 --> 12:29.275
Maybe she's got, you know,
a cure for your situation.

12:29.344 --> 12:31.827
- Why don't you talk to her
about your situation?

12:31.896 --> 12:34.586
- Well, the key
to a good lesbian relationship

12:34.655 --> 12:37.551
is never tell each other
about your yeast infections.

12:37.620 --> 12:38.827
- Hmm.
- Yeah.

12:45.896 --> 12:48.275
- So I'm supposed
to just not stress

12:48.344 --> 12:49.896
while my hair is falling out?

12:49.965 --> 12:51.310
- No, you're supposed to try

12:51.379 --> 12:53.379
to remember that
everything is temporary.

12:53.448 --> 12:55.862
- Oh, that's nice to hear from
the woman that you're dating.

12:55.931 --> 12:57.206
- Hey!

12:57.275 --> 12:59.724
- Hi, we come bearing
Blackout cake.

12:59.793 --> 13:02.241
- Hey!
- Kelsey, good to see you.

13:02.310 --> 13:04.103
- Just don't look too close.

13:04.172 --> 13:06.275
Hey, Charles.
Liza.

13:06.344 --> 13:07.965
- Hey.

13:08.034 --> 13:10.034
- I saw the prescription
in the bathroom.

13:10.103 --> 13:12.310
- Oh, God. Can you pretend
that you didn't?

13:12.379 --> 13:13.586
- No, it's fine.

13:13.655 --> 13:15.241
It's just that that shit's
loaded with chemicals,

13:15.310 --> 13:17.275
and you should really
try a natural antifungal.

13:17.344 --> 13:18.620
- Like what?

13:18.689 --> 13:19.862
- Boop.
- Garlic?

13:19.931 --> 13:21.172
- Yes.

13:21.241 --> 13:23.206
Mm-hmm.

13:23.275 --> 13:26.517
- Wait, what are you doing?
- Trust me.

13:28.724 --> 13:30.586
Breathe.

13:30.655 --> 13:32.862
- Oh, my God, you're crazy.
- Shh.

13:34.310 --> 13:37.275
It's...it's tingling.

13:37.344 --> 13:40.655
- It's doing the job already.

13:40.724 --> 13:42.172
- Okay.

13:47.517 --> 13:48.827
Here you go.

13:48.896 --> 13:52.034
- Mmm.
Maggie, this looks so good!

13:52.103 --> 13:54.000
- Mmm. It does.

13:54.068 --> 13:55.827
Is there garlic bread
on the menu tonight?

13:55.896 --> 13:57.586
- Oh, no.
- Really?

13:57.655 --> 13:59.793
'Cause I'm totally smelling it.
- Yeah.

14:01.034 --> 14:02.310
- Well, there's no bread.

14:02.379 --> 14:05.275
You don't serve bread
with polenta.

14:06.689 --> 14:09.000
- Did you tell Charles
about Bronwyn Madigan?

14:09.068 --> 14:10.689
- Uh, not yet.
- Wait a minute.

14:10.758 --> 14:13.137
Is that the woman that writes
those horny senior novels?

14:13.206 --> 14:14.793
Is she one of your authors?

14:14.862 --> 14:16.206
- She was.

14:16.275 --> 14:18.137
- She left
because we're too young

14:18.206 --> 14:20.931
to understand
how to publish her books.

14:21.000 --> 14:22.724
You can't win.

14:22.793 --> 14:25.000
Don't be too young,
but don't be too old,

14:25.068 --> 14:27.413
and work hard,
but don't stress.

14:27.482 --> 14:30.448
- Well, the new person
always has the hard job

14:30.517 --> 14:32.793
of proving themselves
to the old guard.

14:32.862 --> 14:35.000
- Hmm.
- You'll be fine.

14:39.000 --> 14:41.758
- It's as if someone is
toasting an everything bagel.

14:41.827 --> 14:44.689
- Maybe you're having a stroke.

14:44.758 --> 14:46.448
- Oh, my gosh,
I just got it.

14:46.517 --> 14:48.517
Is there something
in the oven?

14:48.586 --> 14:49.965
- Um, not exactly.

14:50.034 --> 14:51.586
- Oh, so do you guys
all work together?

14:51.655 --> 14:53.034
- We used to.

14:53.103 --> 14:54.517
- Ah, we don't have
to talk about work.

14:54.586 --> 14:56.000
- Oh, my God!

14:56.068 --> 14:58.482
Have you heard about Zane's
new publishing house?

14:58.551 --> 15:00.034
Mercury?

15:00.103 --> 15:04.310
The god of profit and trickery--
it is so Zane.

15:04.379 --> 15:06.827
- Yeah, I heard about the, uh--
the Audrey Colbert book.

15:06.896 --> 15:09.758
That was a, uh...
I was surprised.

15:09.827 --> 15:12.655
Um, is there more wine?
- Oh, yeah, sure.

15:12.724 --> 15:15.275
- On top of all the stress
of being a brand-new publisher,

15:15.344 --> 15:18.413
I also get to deal with Zane
targeting all my authors.

15:18.482 --> 15:20.758
- Ooh.

15:20.827 --> 15:24.724
Ooh, ooh, I just got
a really big hit of it again.

15:24.793 --> 15:27.172
Oh, it's like a garlic knot.
- Yes!

15:27.241 --> 15:29.344
You guys have a garlic knot
haunting your apartment.

15:29.413 --> 15:32.068
- Oh, my God.
- Or escargot.

15:32.137 --> 15:34.241
- I love escargot.

15:34.310 --> 15:36.206
People are smelling me.

15:36.275 --> 15:38.689
It's okay. It's natural.

15:38.758 --> 15:40.862
- You know, Kelsey,
about Zane...

15:40.931 --> 15:42.689
that--that's just business.

15:42.758 --> 15:44.206
I'm sure it's not personal.

15:44.275 --> 15:46.344
- Well, then you clearly
don't know Zane very well,

15:46.413 --> 15:49.344
because he's up to something,
and he's not working alone,

15:49.413 --> 15:51.793
but he wants to
make it seem like he is.

15:51.862 --> 15:53.137
- Yeah, it is strange.

15:53.206 --> 15:55.758
Someone is clearly
giving him money.

15:55.827 --> 15:57.965
- I know, but who?

15:58.034 --> 15:59.379
Who is it?

15:59.448 --> 16:01.896
Seriously, who is it?

16:01.965 --> 16:04.000
- It's me!
I'm the garlic knot.

16:04.068 --> 16:06.344
Beth stuck a whole clove
up my pussy.

16:06.413 --> 16:08.689
- It's plant medicine.

16:08.758 --> 16:11.482
And I think it smells fine.

16:11.551 --> 16:13.448
- Maggie!
- Oh, my God.

16:19.344 --> 16:22.310
- ♪ It's what you're
doing to me, doing to me ♪

16:22.379 --> 16:25.793
♪ Turning it
upside down, yeah ♪

16:25.862 --> 16:27.620
- Hey.

16:27.689 --> 16:29.620
Is there something
you're not telling me?

16:29.689 --> 16:32.827
- Yeah. You know, in a--
in a lot of circles,

16:32.896 --> 16:36.137
Bronwyn's books are known as,
uh, matron lit.

16:36.206 --> 16:38.586
Uh, so it--it probably
wouldn't be a good fit

16:38.655 --> 16:40.034
for Millennial anyway.

16:40.103 --> 16:42.344
Good night, Liza.

16:45.793 --> 16:49.310
- Charles...

16:49.379 --> 16:52.000
I have lied to a lot of people
for a long time,

16:52.068 --> 16:54.275
and I know what it looks like.

16:54.344 --> 16:56.241
I saw you with Zane.

16:56.310 --> 16:58.103
I know you mortgaged
the town house,

16:58.172 --> 17:01.241
and I think you're
behind Mercury.

17:03.275 --> 17:07.000
- I never wanted
to give up publishing.

17:08.793 --> 17:11.758
I wanted to be with you.

17:11.827 --> 17:13.827
And I wanted to keep
the company going,

17:13.896 --> 17:16.517
so I had to make choices.

17:16.586 --> 17:20.379
- So you are behind Mercury.

17:20.448 --> 17:24.793
Why didn't you just tell me?
- I'm sorry, Liza.

17:24.862 --> 17:26.241
I was planning to tell you.

17:26.310 --> 17:28.275
I was looking
for the right time.

17:28.344 --> 17:29.655
To be honest,
this whole thing

17:29.724 --> 17:32.655
took off a lot faster
than expected.

17:32.724 --> 17:35.758
- But I don't understand.
Millennial is your company.

17:35.827 --> 17:38.241
- No, it's my dad's company.

17:38.310 --> 17:41.206
I wanted to build
something of my own.

17:41.275 --> 17:42.827
And this...

17:42.896 --> 17:45.068
this was my chance...

17:45.137 --> 17:48.965
to take a risk,
to--to reinvent myself.

17:49.034 --> 17:51.827
If anyone
can understand that...

17:51.896 --> 17:53.379
it's you.

17:53.448 --> 17:55.413
- You cannot be
on the board of Millennial

17:55.482 --> 17:58.310
and run a competing
publishing house.

17:58.379 --> 18:01.862
- I just need some time
to figure it out.

18:03.344 --> 18:05.379
Until that time...

18:05.448 --> 18:08.379
can this stay between us?

18:08.448 --> 18:11.931
- You mean don't tell Kelsey.
- Not anyone.

18:13.655 --> 18:15.689
Just for now.

18:24.724 --> 18:26.379
- Hey.
- Don't come too close.

18:26.448 --> 18:28.689
I'm still off-gassing.
-  What a night.

18:28.758 --> 18:30.862
-  At least your date
didn't try to stuff you

18:30.931 --> 18:32.931
like a cocktail olive.

18:36.551 --> 18:38.655
- Hey.
- I can't text, I'm running.

18:38.724 --> 18:40.517
Bronwyn tweeted that
she has a meeting

18:40.586 --> 18:43.241
at Suffolk House this morning,
and I know it's with Zane.

18:43.310 --> 18:45.275
I'm running to intercept, okay?
- Wait.

18:45.344 --> 18:47.931
- I'm going underground.
Just meet me there.

18:48.000 --> 18:50.827
- Kelsey. Kelsey!
Shit. Damn it!

18:50.896 --> 18:52.517
- Um...

18:52.586 --> 18:53.931
uh, okay, bye!

19:10.103 --> 19:12.034
I know that you're meeting
with other publishing houses.

19:12.103 --> 19:15.103
And I just want you
to make the right choice.

19:15.172 --> 19:16.551
That's not Mercury.

19:16.620 --> 19:19.586
- Yeah, I suppose
the right choice is Millennial?

19:19.655 --> 19:21.068
- Yes.

19:21.137 --> 19:22.931
We are a company run by women

19:23.000 --> 19:27.379
who want important women's
voices to be heard--your voice.

19:27.448 --> 19:29.517
What is Mercury?
Who is Mercury?

19:29.586 --> 19:31.413
- Hey, there!
- The cavalry is here.

19:31.482 --> 19:33.379
- Kelsey, can I talk to you
for a minute?

19:33.448 --> 19:35.000
- Yes. Sit down.

19:35.068 --> 19:37.344
Honestly, Bronwyn,
not to take away from your work,

19:37.413 --> 19:39.620
but Zane is out to steal
our authors, all right?

19:39.689 --> 19:42.206
He's a former employee
who has a personal vendetta

19:42.275 --> 19:43.448
against our company.

19:43.517 --> 19:44.862
- She didn't come here
to see Zane.

19:44.931 --> 19:46.586
- I'm pretty sure she did.

19:46.655 --> 19:48.551
- No, I don't know Zane
from a wart on my butt.

19:48.620 --> 19:52.275
I came here to see Charles.

19:52.344 --> 19:53.965
- What the--

19:54.034 --> 19:55.413
- Oh, God.

19:55.482 --> 19:57.206
- You're the money
behind Mercury?

19:57.275 --> 19:59.896
- Kelsey, if you just give me--
- Did you know about this?

19:59.965 --> 20:02.103
- I just found out.
I was coming to tell you.

20:02.172 --> 20:04.172
- You're the Chairman
of the Board.

20:04.241 --> 20:05.862
You're working
against your own company?

20:05.931 --> 20:10.413
You're working against me?
- Wow, this is interesting.

20:10.482 --> 20:12.241
- Could we talk outside?

20:12.310 --> 20:13.896
- Yeah, that's a good idea.
- No.

20:13.965 --> 20:15.620
No, you know what?

20:15.689 --> 20:17.655
Bronwyn should know who she's
getting into business with.

20:17.724 --> 20:20.448
A man who is
by your side one minute

20:20.517 --> 20:23.586
and then the next trying
to steal your authors.

20:23.655 --> 20:28.034
My hair is falling out because
of you and because of you.

20:28.103 --> 20:30.275
I hope you know who you're
getting into business with

20:30.344 --> 20:32.620
because I sure as hell didn't.

20:34.137 --> 20:36.241
- Liza, wait.
- Is this you figuring it out?

20:36.310 --> 20:39.241
- Bronwyn reached out to me.

20:40.724 --> 20:43.172
- He called your books
"matron lit."

20:50.241 --> 20:51.482

20:51.551 --> 20:53.758

21:01.206 --> 21:03.655
- Hi, Gemma!

21:03.724 --> 21:05.862
Are you sure it's a good idea
to have her in the studio?

21:05.931 --> 21:07.344
- Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

21:07.413 --> 21:09.448
The buzzing needles actually
put her right to sleep.

21:09.517 --> 21:11.413
It's been amazing.

21:11.482 --> 21:15.137
I have learned so much
in the last two days.

21:15.206 --> 21:18.068
Like, she loves walks...

21:18.137 --> 21:20.517
loves being read to.

21:22.275 --> 21:24.862
- "The Hung Juror"?
- Yeah.

21:24.931 --> 21:26.689
- Is this what
you've been reading her?

21:26.758 --> 21:30.137
- Okay, look, Kelsey brought
home a bunch of senior erotica.

21:30.206 --> 21:32.448
Here, listen to this.

21:34.034 --> 21:38.931
"Frank held Cathy as she waved
good-bye to her grandkids.

21:39.000 --> 21:42.000
His tumescence growing."

21:42.068 --> 21:43.448
Look at her eyes.

21:43.517 --> 21:45.241
- Are you kidding me with this?

21:45.310 --> 21:46.896
She loves it!

21:46.965 --> 21:48.724
- Well, thanks
for looking after her.

21:48.793 --> 21:51.827
- Yeah.
I mean...

21:51.896 --> 21:55.689
I'm her dad, you know,
not her babysitter.

21:55.758 --> 21:57.620
- I know.

21:59.551 --> 22:02.931
Hey, um...

22:03.000 --> 22:05.068
Look, so...

22:06.862 --> 22:09.862
I know we're getting
a divorce, and...

22:09.931 --> 22:14.724
we're going to deal
with custody stuff, but...

22:14.793 --> 22:18.172
I really want
to be in her life full-time.

22:20.241 --> 22:23.068
Or at least
equally split time.

22:25.000 --> 22:26.758
And, uh...

22:26.827 --> 22:30.034
I want sleepovers
on a regular basis.

22:32.000 --> 22:33.241
Let's just figure out

22:33.310 --> 22:35.517
this whole
parenting thing together, okay?

22:35.586 --> 22:38.655
- That'd be great, actually.

22:38.724 --> 22:40.241
Just...

22:40.310 --> 22:42.586
don't bring her down
to the studio anymore.

22:42.655 --> 22:45.689
- Deal.

22:52.586 --> 22:56.413
- My hair is falling out
because of you and you!

22:56.482 --> 22:57.517
Everyone is going
to see this video.

22:57.586 --> 23:00.000
- It's just Publisher's Lunch.

23:00.068 --> 23:01.689
- It's also trending
on Reddit.

23:01.758 --> 23:03.034
- You know what?

23:03.103 --> 23:04.931
Charles is the one
that looks bad, not me.

23:05.000 --> 23:08.827
He's completely
in the wrong here.

23:08.896 --> 23:10.275
Say something.

23:10.344 --> 23:12.310
- Bronwyn, who apparently
does think we're peers,

23:12.379 --> 23:14.137
is staying put.

23:14.206 --> 23:15.620
- Really?
- Yeah!

23:15.689 --> 23:17.000
- She said anyone who fights

23:17.068 --> 23:18.517
for her like you did,
she's sticking with.

23:18.586 --> 23:20.758
- Okay.
Now, that is some good news.

23:22.862 --> 23:24.655
- So--
- Why are you two looking

23:24.724 --> 23:26.379
at me like
my eyebrows fell off?

23:26.448 --> 23:27.931
Oh, my God, did they?

23:28.000 --> 23:29.586
- No, gosh, of course not.

23:29.655 --> 23:31.517
I got calls from three agents

23:31.586 --> 23:33.137
and emails
from another handful.

23:33.206 --> 23:35.344
They're all making noise
about moving their clients

23:35.413 --> 23:38.000
from Millennial...

23:38.068 --> 23:39.655
to Mercury.

23:39.724 --> 23:41.586
They don't care
that Charles is in the wrong.

23:41.655 --> 23:43.344
They want the gray hair
in the room.

23:43.413 --> 23:47.413
- No. I'm calling an emergency
board meeting. He can't do that!

23:47.482 --> 23:49.482
- Charles resigned
from the board

23:49.551 --> 23:51.689
about an hour ago.

23:51.758 --> 23:53.310
- He did?

23:54.448 --> 23:56.655
What does that mean?

23:56.724 --> 23:59.241
- That he's officially
our competition now.

23:59.310 --> 24:02.793
- ♪ This is a woman's world ♪

24:05.103 --> 24:08.827
♪ We're strong,
and we're taking the world ♪
