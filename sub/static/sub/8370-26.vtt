01:01.112 --> 01:03.378
_

01:06.317 --> 01:08.217
This way everyone!

01:09.921 --> 01:11.086
What a mess!

01:11.122 --> 01:13.255
The rhino's headed
for the baboons' tree!

01:13.291 --> 01:16.125
- Then we better get there first.
- On it.

01:20.932 --> 01:22.131
What just happened?

01:22.166 --> 01:23.966
<i> Hapana!
We're too late!</i>

01:24.001 --> 01:26.368
Un-Bunga-lievable!

01:26.404 --> 01:28.237
It's raining baboons!

01:29.140 --> 01:31.941
Not exactly. Look!

01:31.976 --> 01:35.177
Hey! That's Kifaru!
But he's a nice rhino.

01:35.212 --> 01:38.180
- Why's he smashin' into things?
- I dunno, Beshte.

01:39.250 --> 01:40.916
But we've got to stop him

01:40.952 --> 01:43.285
before he really hurts
somebody. Come on!

01:43.321 --> 01:46.121
Hey, you know, we could
just catch the baboons...

01:48.960 --> 01:49.959
Or...

01:49.994 --> 01:51.160
Or maybe not.

01:51.195 --> 01:54.096
Kifaru!
Stop shaking that tree!

01:54.131 --> 01:57.166
Don't yell at me.
I didn't put the tree here!

01:57.201 --> 01:59.335
Hey, Kifaru?
What's the kerbubble?

01:59.370 --> 02:01.103
Oh, Beshte. It's you.

02:02.039 --> 02:03.172
I'm kinda stuck.

02:03.207 --> 02:05.975
Don't worry.
Everything's gonna be okay.

02:06.010 --> 02:07.109
The Lion Guard's here now.

02:07.144 --> 02:08.943
We'll get you loose, Kifaru.

02:08.979 --> 02:10.245
Then you can tell us
what happened.

02:10.281 --> 02:12.314
Oh, that would be wonderful.

02:12.350 --> 02:15.184
Beshte, you push
the tree that way.

02:15.219 --> 02:18.153
Fuli, Bunga, and I will
move Kifaru the other way.

02:18.189 --> 02:20.356
Ono, watch his horn
but don't get too close.

02:22.026 --> 02:23.959
You don't have
to tell me twice.

02:23.995 --> 02:26.895
Everybody ready?
Now, go!

02:29.266 --> 02:32.234
Okay, doing great...
So close...

02:32.269 --> 02:35.204
- Yes!
- Thank you!

02:35.239 --> 02:38.307
You don't know how it felt
to be stuck like that!

02:38.342 --> 02:40.142
I kinda do!

02:40.177 --> 02:43.078
Oh.
Sorry, Bunga.

02:43.114 --> 02:46.081
And I thought your pointy end
was the dangerous one.

02:46.117 --> 02:48.117
So what's going on, Kifaru?

02:48.152 --> 02:51.020
- Why're you causing so much trouble?
- What trouble?

02:51.055 --> 02:53.155
You shook the baboons
out of their tree.

02:53.190 --> 02:56.091
So that's what
they were shouting about...

02:56.127 --> 02:57.359
Not to mention knocking down

02:57.395 --> 02:58.961
a whole bunch of trees before that.

02:59.430 --> 03:03.232
Oh... I thought it
was odd that so many trees

03:03.267 --> 03:05.134
were growing
on the path to Lake Matope.

03:05.169 --> 03:06.969
- Hey! Look out!
- Oh, sorry!

03:07.004 --> 03:10.105
Whoa! Watch where
you point that thing!

03:10.141 --> 03:13.755
Sorry! Sorry!
I better be on my way.

03:15.046 --> 03:16.912
He's going to run
into another tree.

03:16.947 --> 03:18.347
It's like he doesn't
know it's there.

03:18.382 --> 03:22.080
He doesn't!
He doesn't have his tickbird!

03:23.020 --> 03:25.354
- Kifaru! Stop, stop!
- Ono?

03:25.389 --> 03:27.256
- What's wrong?
- You tell me.

03:27.291 --> 03:29.291
What happened to your tickbird?

03:29.326 --> 03:31.293
You mean Mwenzi?

03:31.328 --> 03:33.195
That's right. Mwenzi!

03:33.230 --> 03:35.164
I see you guys
together all the time.

03:35.199 --> 03:39.068
Not anymore you won't.
He left me this morning.

03:39.103 --> 03:42.171
No reason or anything.
He just flew away.

03:42.206 --> 03:44.039
That explains everything!

03:44.075 --> 03:46.075
- It does?
- Absolutely!

03:46.110 --> 03:50.045
- Rhinos have very poor eyesight...
- Ono! Shh!

03:50.081 --> 03:51.914
He's standing right there!

03:51.949 --> 03:54.083
Believe me,
I know all about it.

03:54.118 --> 03:56.952
My eyesight's worse
than most rhinos!

03:56.987 --> 03:59.321
That's why rhinos
partner with tickbirds.

03:59.356 --> 04:01.190
The tickbirds
ride on the rhinos

04:01.225 --> 04:02.891
and warn them
about dangers

04:02.927 --> 04:04.259
that the rhinos can't see!

04:04.295 --> 04:05.961
Common knowledge, really.

04:05.996 --> 04:07.329
That's awfully nice of them!

04:07.364 --> 04:09.031
What's in it for the tickbirds?

04:09.066 --> 04:10.899
- Ticks, of course.
- Ugh.

04:10.935 --> 04:12.968
And all the other bugs
they find on our backs!

04:13.003 --> 04:15.037
They eat 'em all up!

04:15.072 --> 04:17.272
Mmm! Sounds like
a good deal to me.

04:17.308 --> 04:18.940
Oh, it is!

04:20.277 --> 04:23.946
<i> # Tickbirds and rhinos #</i>

04:23.981 --> 04:25.513
<i> # Were always a pair #</i>

04:40.998 --> 04:42.729
<i> # We're always a pair #</i>

04:45.136 --> 04:47.202
So you didn't mean
to cause all that trouble.

04:47.238 --> 04:48.971
You just can't see
where you're going.

04:49.006 --> 04:52.141
That's right.
I'm really sorry.

04:52.176 --> 04:54.343
I was just trying
to go to Tamasha.

04:54.378 --> 04:57.317
- What's Tamasha?
- Every wet season,

04:57.352 --> 05:01.950
all us rhinos get
together near Lake Matope.

05:01.986 --> 05:04.319
And we all spar in the mud.

05:04.355 --> 05:06.188
It's great.

05:06.223 --> 05:08.991
Poor guy seems awfully sad
he won't get to go.

05:09.026 --> 05:12.027
That's why we need to find
Mwenzi and get him to come back.

05:12.062 --> 05:15.682
But what if we can't find him
in time to get Kifaru to Tamasha?

05:15.717 --> 05:19.134
I know! We find him a temporary
tickbird to take him there.

05:19.170 --> 05:21.270
A tickbird like me!

05:21.305 --> 05:23.105
- You?
- Sure!

05:23.140 --> 05:26.074
Riding around the savannah
with all the bugs I can eat?

05:26.110 --> 05:27.910
What could be better?

05:27.945 --> 05:32.114
Kifaru! Say hello
to your new tickbird!

05:32.149 --> 05:33.315
<i> Zuka Zama!</i>

05:33.350 --> 05:36.952
Bunga?
But you're not a bird!

05:36.987 --> 05:40.923
Trust me! I'll getcha to
Lake Matope and have a snack!

05:40.958 --> 05:41.924
Okay.

05:42.960 --> 05:46.962
Uh, well, bye, Kifaru!
See ya, Little B!

05:47.231 --> 05:48.363
See ya!

05:48.399 --> 05:51.333
I think Bunga's gonna do
a great job guiding Kifaru.

05:51.368 --> 05:54.687
No, he's not! Kifaru!

05:56.373 --> 05:59.108
- Kifaru, stop!
- Huh?

06:00.344 --> 06:02.110
Huh. Look at that.

06:02.146 --> 06:07.216
- Kifaru. Step back slowly.
- Uh, okay, Ono.

06:07.251 --> 06:09.318
That's it, keep going.

06:11.222 --> 06:13.021
Sorry, Kirafu.

06:13.057 --> 06:14.256
I was having
so much fun snacking,

06:14.291 --> 06:16.325
I forgot to look
where we were going!

06:16.360 --> 06:19.294
Wow! Kifaru really
listened to you, Ono.

06:19.330 --> 06:22.064
Well, you know.
It's a rhino/bird thing.

06:22.099 --> 06:23.198
<i> Poa!</i>

06:23.234 --> 06:26.034
You'd be great at helping
Kifaru get to Lake Matope.

06:26.070 --> 06:28.103
Definitely!
Wait.

06:28.138 --> 06:30.172
You want me
to be Kifaru's tickbird?

06:30.207 --> 06:32.007
You are the keenest
of sight...

06:32.042 --> 06:36.044
Which is why you need me to
help find Kifaru's real tickbird!

06:36.080 --> 06:38.046
Kion and I
can track Mwenzi by scent.

06:38.082 --> 06:39.881
And I know
what he looks like.

06:39.917 --> 06:41.116
He's got
a bright red beak.

06:41.151 --> 06:43.185
But I'm a member
of the Lion Guard.

06:43.220 --> 06:46.221
I can't just sit around on
some rhino's back all day!

06:46.257 --> 06:48.357
You won't be just
sitting around, Ono.

06:48.392 --> 06:50.993
By guiding Kifaru
to Tamasha,

06:51.028 --> 06:52.928
you'll be protecting
the Pride Lands.

06:52.963 --> 06:54.129
But... But...

06:54.164 --> 06:57.266
And protecting the Pride Lands
is the Lion Guard's duty.

06:57.301 --> 06:59.268
Yeah. You're right.

06:59.303 --> 07:02.271
Hey, Ono. You, uh, want some
tips from a former tickbird?

07:02.306 --> 07:05.841
You have tips?
You nearly guided him off a cliff!

07:05.876 --> 07:09.278
Okay, fine, no tips.
Suit yourself.

07:15.152 --> 07:16.918
I got the scent. You?

07:18.255 --> 07:20.188
Yeah. Let's go find Mwenzi.

07:20.224 --> 07:22.224
See you later, Ono!
Bye.

07:22.259 --> 07:24.259
Save me some ticks!

07:24.295 --> 07:27.162
Okay Ono.
Which way to Lake Matope?

07:27.197 --> 07:29.031
To the right.

07:29.066 --> 07:30.065
Righty-o!

07:31.168 --> 07:32.200
No! No!

07:32.236 --> 07:34.269
Your other right!
Other right!

07:34.305 --> 07:36.104
Oh, my other right!

07:37.207 --> 07:38.907
Why didn't you say so?

07:38.942 --> 07:42.210
This is going to be a long trip.

07:48.919 --> 07:51.365
- Everything okay, Ono?
- Fine. Fine.

07:51.400 --> 07:54.122
Everything's fine.
Just keep walking.

07:54.158 --> 07:55.357
Okey-dokey.

08:03.334 --> 08:06.034
Okay. We want to take
the path to the right.

08:06.937 --> 08:08.170
Righty-o.

08:08.205 --> 08:12.207
No, the other right.
The other right.

08:12.242 --> 08:13.975
It's this way!

08:14.011 --> 08:17.846
Okay, okay.
You don't have to shout.

08:17.881 --> 08:19.047
Mwenzi never shouted.

08:20.017 --> 08:21.850
Until...

08:21.885 --> 08:23.885
Until he decided
to leave.

08:26.123 --> 08:28.156
Oh, I'm sorry. I just...

08:29.360 --> 08:31.059
Ow!

08:31.095 --> 08:35.297
- Ono? I have an itch.
- Okay...

08:35.332 --> 08:39.301
When rhinos have itches,
their tickbirds scratch them.

08:39.336 --> 08:42.169
Mwenzi did it for me
all the time.

08:42.206 --> 08:45.240
I see. Okay.
Where's the itch?

08:46.977 --> 08:48.143
Inside my ear.

08:48.178 --> 08:49.978
Of course it is.

08:52.383 --> 08:53.915
There you go.

08:53.951 --> 08:55.283
Now...
You didn't get it.

08:58.956 --> 09:00.222
Up a little...

09:00.257 --> 09:02.824
Wait, now down
just a little...

09:02.860 --> 09:06.027
Okay. Why don't we get
going to Lake Matope now?

09:06.063 --> 09:09.931
But Mwenzi wouldn't stop
scratching till I told him to stop.

09:09.967 --> 09:13.235
Kifaru, I'm not Mwenzi.

09:13.270 --> 09:16.004
No. No, you're not...

09:21.278 --> 09:23.278
Excuse me.

09:23.313 --> 09:27.015
I hope the guard
finds Mwenzi soon.

09:27.050 --> 09:31.153
Ono, I may not see very well,
but my hearing is perfect.

09:31.188 --> 09:34.322
And Mwenzi would never mutter
under his breath!

09:34.358 --> 09:36.992
Sorry.

09:42.299 --> 09:44.199
I think I've seen
this tree before.

09:44.234 --> 09:45.233
You have.

09:45.269 --> 09:47.302
We're just going around
in circles.

09:47.337 --> 09:50.071
We just can't seem
to get a good scent!

09:53.343 --> 09:55.277
Hey, I think Mwenzi's
been here!

09:56.079 --> 09:57.245
Yeah.

09:57.281 --> 09:58.947
Pretty recently too.

09:58.982 --> 10:01.049
Maybe he's still here!
I'll check it out!

10:01.084 --> 10:03.118
<i> Zuka Zama!</i>

10:05.222 --> 10:08.056
Nope! No sign of...
Hey, look!

10:09.159 --> 10:11.359
- Is that him?
- I didn't see it!

10:11.395 --> 10:13.995
There!
I saw a red beak!

10:14.031 --> 10:15.964
Big B, you know Mwenzi.

10:15.999 --> 10:17.966
- Is that him?
- I'm not sure.

10:18.001 --> 10:21.102
He flew by so fast.
Mwenzi!

10:21.138 --> 10:23.104
I don't know
if that's not Mwenzi,

10:23.140 --> 10:26.719
- or he's just ignoring me.
- I have an idea.

10:28.178 --> 10:33.215
Oh, no! I'm a lonely
little rhino covered with ticks!

10:33.250 --> 10:36.218
If only I had a tickbird to help me out!

10:39.256 --> 10:43.024
Don't worry, little rhino!
I'll help you!

10:43.060 --> 10:45.994
Hey! I don't have any
ticks back here! What gives?

10:46.029 --> 10:47.766
- Hey, there, Mwenzi!
- Beshte?

10:47.801 --> 10:50.966
- But you're not a rhino!
- Ha!

10:51.001 --> 10:54.202
But you're just the tickbird
we've been looking for!

10:55.172 --> 10:57.105
Uh-uh? Lion Guard?

10:57.140 --> 10:58.340
What do you want with me?

10:58.375 --> 11:00.208
Sorry we tricked you, Mwenzi.

11:00.244 --> 11:04.012
But it was the only way to
get you to stop and talk to us.

11:04.047 --> 11:06.314
- Talk about what?
- Uh, Kifaru?

11:06.350 --> 11:08.950
Oh. Him?
What about him?

11:08.986 --> 11:12.187
Well, without you, he's
causing all sorts of damage.

11:12.222 --> 11:14.055
He really needs his tickbird.

11:14.091 --> 11:15.323
You have to come back to him.

11:15.359 --> 11:17.158
After what he did?
No way!

11:17.194 --> 11:18.226
What'd he do?

11:18.262 --> 11:21.029
He said you just flew off
for no reason.

11:21.064 --> 11:23.265
No reason?
No reason?!

11:23.300 --> 11:26.034
Is that what he said?
No reason?

11:26.069 --> 11:30.272
- So you're saying there was a reason?
- Uh, yeah!

11:30.307 --> 11:33.942
We were running late for
Tamasha, and he blamed me!

11:33.977 --> 11:38.079
We're always late.
It's always Kifaru's fault!

11:38.115 --> 11:42.150
But he always blames me!
So what would you do?

11:42.185 --> 11:45.053
I'd leave and I wouldn't look back.

11:46.390 --> 11:49.391
But, uh, that doesn't mean
it's what you should do.

11:49.426 --> 11:50.926
Yeah, Mwenzi.

11:50.961 --> 11:53.128
You and Kifaru were
such good friends.

11:53.163 --> 11:55.230
He seems pretty lost
without you.

11:55.265 --> 11:57.232
And not just because
he can't see!

11:57.267 --> 12:00.001
Though he really
can't see!

12:00.037 --> 12:02.337
Doesn't seem like
you're doing so great either.

12:02.372 --> 12:05.040
Looked like you were
just flying around aimlessly.

12:05.075 --> 12:07.943
Well, uh, I am used
to having a job to do.

12:07.978 --> 12:11.112
- Looking after Kifaru, right?
- Yeah.

12:11.148 --> 12:13.882
Just come with us
and talk to him.

12:13.917 --> 12:15.183
Real friends work things out.

12:15.218 --> 12:18.887
- You really think he misses me?
- Of course he does.

12:18.922 --> 12:20.088
Look how much time
you spent together.

12:20.123 --> 12:21.122
How could he not?

12:21.959 --> 12:25.360
Okay. I guess it
wouldn't hurt to talk to him.

12:30.133 --> 12:31.299
Whew.

12:32.169 --> 12:33.234
Here you go!

12:33.270 --> 12:34.336
What are these?

12:34.371 --> 12:36.004
Jackalberry leaves.

12:36.039 --> 12:37.205
You asked for them.

12:37.240 --> 12:39.274
I had to fly halfway across
the savannah to...

12:39.309 --> 12:42.177
But I like the dark green
jackalberry leaves.

12:42.212 --> 12:44.079
How am I supposed
to know that?

12:44.114 --> 12:45.914
Well, Mwenzi knows.

12:45.949 --> 12:48.049
I'm not Mwenzi!

12:49.953 --> 12:52.053
Hmm, you know, Ono...

12:52.089 --> 12:54.847
- I should actually thank you.
- You think so?

12:54.882 --> 12:58.226
Yes. If you weren't so
bad at being a tickbird,

12:58.261 --> 13:02.130
I'd never know how wonderful
Mwenzi really was.

13:02.165 --> 13:04.099
Well, you're welcome.

13:04.134 --> 13:06.234
Wait, what?

13:06.269 --> 13:08.970
Ah! Kifaru!
What's wrong?

13:09.006 --> 13:13.141
All this walking's
got me overheated.

13:13.176 --> 13:17.078
Oh! Uh, well, the lake's
not too much farther...

13:17.114 --> 13:21.919
Mwenzi'd always make sure
I was near mud to cool off.

13:23.053 --> 13:25.320
Maybe I can dig for some mud.

13:25.355 --> 13:28.056
Huh. Here.
Let me help.

13:30.060 --> 13:33.128
Oh! Oh, this is nice!

13:33.163 --> 13:35.163
Mwenzi's so much
smaller than you.

13:35.198 --> 13:37.365
He could never do
something like this for me.

13:37.401 --> 13:41.236
Did you just say I was
better at something than Mwenzi?

13:41.271 --> 13:43.972
Oh, yeah.

13:44.007 --> 13:47.165
<i>Little Mwenzi couldn't
do this if he tried.</i>

13:47.244 --> 13:50.078
Ono, you're the best.

13:50.113 --> 13:51.212
Ono's the best?

13:51.248 --> 13:53.982
I thought you said Kifaru
was lost without me?!

13:54.017 --> 13:55.984
But he was!
You should have seen him...

13:56.019 --> 13:59.087
I do see him! And I see
that he's doing just fine!

13:59.122 --> 14:00.989
Well, if that's what he wants...

14:01.024 --> 14:02.924
- Kifaru!
- Huh? Mwenzi?

14:02.959 --> 14:05.026
Mwenzi! You came back!

14:05.062 --> 14:08.229
Only to say this.
Goodbye forever!

14:08.265 --> 14:10.865
- No!
- Mwenzi, wait!

14:11.134 --> 14:15.255
Mwenzi!

14:17.074 --> 14:22.811
Well, Ono, looks like you'll have
to be my tickbird from now on.

14:23.013 --> 14:25.914
Mwenzi!

14:25.949 --> 14:29.317
- Wait, wait! We need to talk!
- Ono, stop!

14:29.352 --> 14:32.921
What about Kifaru? It's
not safe to leave him alone!

14:32.956 --> 14:36.778
Then you four take care of him!
I'm getting that tickbird back!

14:38.061 --> 14:41.963
Hey, Kifaru!
We're back in business!

14:41.998 --> 14:44.065
Bring on the bugs!

14:44.101 --> 14:46.067
Hey! Did Ono eat 'em all?

14:46.970 --> 14:48.103
You okay, Kifaru?

14:48.138 --> 14:52.273
Well, I just lost my tickbird
and my backup tickbird.

14:54.144 --> 14:55.944
How do you think I feel?

14:55.979 --> 14:57.912
Know what'll
make you feel better?

14:57.948 --> 15:00.081
Sparring with other rhinos
at Tamasha!

15:00.117 --> 15:01.182
Come on, Kifaru.

15:01.218 --> 15:03.218
Let's get you to Lake Matope.

15:03.253 --> 15:05.019
Oh, okay...

15:05.055 --> 15:06.154
Thanks.

15:06.189 --> 15:08.890
Maybe Tamasha will make me
feel better.

15:08.925 --> 15:09.891
Hop down, Bunga.

15:13.330 --> 15:15.997
Go straight!
Go straight!

15:16.032 --> 15:17.098
Whoops. My bad.

15:18.368 --> 15:19.934
Mwenzi!

15:20.303 --> 15:22.237
Mwenzi!

15:22.272 --> 15:24.172
Mwenzi!
What are you doing?

15:24.207 --> 15:27.876
You can't stay here.
You can't order me around, Ono.

15:27.911 --> 15:31.079
- I'm not your rhino.
- I don't have a rhino.

15:31.114 --> 15:33.081
And I'm not
ordering you around.

15:33.116 --> 15:34.916
It's just not safe here.

15:34.951 --> 15:37.051
Makuu and his crocodiles
hang out here.

15:37.087 --> 15:39.888
If you don't want to get
eaten, you have to move!

15:39.923 --> 15:41.956
Oh, yeah?
Why would I listen to you?

15:41.992 --> 15:43.191
You were trying
to take my place!

15:43.226 --> 15:45.994
I wasn't!
And I couldn't, anyway.

15:46.029 --> 15:47.295
The whole time
I was with Kifaru,

15:47.330 --> 15:50.131
all he did was complain
and wish I was you.

15:50.167 --> 15:52.000
That's not what
it looked like to me.

15:52.035 --> 15:53.902
I couldn't do anything right.

15:53.937 --> 15:56.304
Speaking of right, how do you
get him to make a right turn?

15:56.339 --> 15:58.006
Why should I tell you?

15:58.041 --> 16:01.176
So you couldn't get him
to turn right either?

16:01.211 --> 16:05.113
Of course I could! You just
make him turn three lefts!

16:05.148 --> 16:09.984
Three lefts?
Why didn't I think of that?

16:10.020 --> 16:13.087
See, that's what makes
you a great tickbird.

16:13.123 --> 16:14.255
Oh, I did my best.

16:14.291 --> 16:16.324
Kifaru never was good
with directions.

16:16.359 --> 16:19.994
So how do you
handle the noises?

16:20.030 --> 16:23.264
You know, the...

16:23.300 --> 16:25.967
No, no, it's more like...

16:30.106 --> 16:32.106
Yes! Yes! That's it!

16:32.142 --> 16:33.274
That's totally it!

16:33.310 --> 16:35.877
Yeah, he's a mess.

16:35.912 --> 16:38.112
He's kind of my mess, though.

You miss him, don't you?

17:08.044 --> 17:11.246
Oh, he drives me crazy,
but he's my best friend.

17:11.281 --> 17:13.013
Does that make sense?

17:13.049 --> 17:15.215
One of my best friends
is a honey badger.

17:15.252 --> 17:17.852
You should
hear the noises he makes.

17:19.055 --> 17:22.223
Hmm. Lunchtime.

17:24.961 --> 17:26.994
I'm sure you two
can work things out.

17:27.030 --> 17:29.264
Just come back
with me and talk to him.

17:29.299 --> 17:33.098
- You know what? I will.

I'll go get help!

Okay, Ono.

Hey, look, Kifaru!

17:55.125 --> 17:57.926
- We're almost there!
- Really?

17:59.129 --> 18:00.295
Take our word for it.

18:00.330 --> 18:04.933
Everyone, everyone!
Mwenzi's in trouble!

18:04.968 --> 18:06.100
Who cares about him?

18:07.003 --> 18:09.037
Makuu's got him trapped!

18:09.072 --> 18:11.172
Makuu the crocodile?

18:11.207 --> 18:14.943
Mwenzi doesn't stand a chance!
I gotta save him!

18:14.978 --> 18:16.978
Any chance
he's going the right way?

18:17.013 --> 18:20.942
Mwenzi! I'm coming!

18:22.185 --> 18:24.152
Amazingly enough, he is!

18:24.187 --> 18:27.289

give it up, Makuu?

I'm not about to fall, and
I'm too high for you to reach.

18:37.334 --> 18:40.234
I might have a trick or
two that'll surprise you.

18:51.982 --> 18:54.248
You won't be
so lucky next time.

18:54.284 --> 18:57.318
There won't be
a next time, Makuu!

18:57.354 --> 19:00.088
Kifaru?
You came for me?

19:00.123 --> 19:03.057
Leave my friend alone!

19:07.097 --> 19:13.067
Nice try, rhino.
But this does change things.

19:13.103 --> 19:16.844
It's no longer a small snack...

19:25.148 --> 19:29.017
A great big meal like this

19:29.052 --> 19:33.021
is gonna take more than
one croc to bring down!

19:33.056 --> 19:36.324
Just wait till I get loose, Makuu!

19:36.359 --> 19:39.961
No, I don't think
we will.

19:39.996 --> 19:42.263
Think again, Makuu!

19:42.298 --> 19:45.333
Oh, the Lion Guard...

19:47.070 --> 19:50.004
This isn't
your business, Kion.
