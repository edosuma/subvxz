WEBVTT

00:06.353 --> 00:07.881
Oh no!

00:07.882 --> 00:09.785
- You didn't.
- Oh yes, I did.

00:10.654 --> 00:11.672
Told you I'd buy a bike.

00:11.673 --> 00:13.696
Jordan is not gonna be happy.

00:14.115 --> 00:15.194
Jordan knows.

00:15.195 --> 00:16.058
Really?

00:16.059 --> 00:16.394
Yeah.

00:16.395 --> 00:18.696
So, she's cool with her baby
daddy riding a donor cycle?

00:18.696 --> 00:20.993
Oh, no, I didn't say that. No.

00:20.994 --> 00:22.577
- I said I told her I was gonna do it.
- Mm.

00:22.578 --> 00:24.424
Speaking of, does Janet know

00:24.425 --> 00:26.665
that you're going to Dubai next month?

00:26.666 --> 00:28.661
Not exactly. Hasn't come up.

00:28.662 --> 00:30.964
Oh, hasn't come up 'cause
you haven't told her.

00:31.601 --> 00:32.720
Okay.

00:32.720 --> 00:34.214
Janet is gonna roast your nuts.

00:34.215 --> 00:35.711
I'm just waiting for the right time.

00:35.712 --> 00:37.014
Who am I kidding? I'm delaying

00:37.015 --> 00:38.327
because I know she's gonna be pissed,

00:38.328 --> 00:40.729
and I don't blame her, but I have to go.

00:40.730 --> 00:43.346
Oh, you have to. Ali saved your life.

00:43.347 --> 00:45.717
- You owe him.
- And so does Janet.

00:45.718 --> 00:48.122
I'm just waiting for the
right time to tell her.

00:48.123 --> 00:49.969
I don't know that there
is a right time, buddy.

00:50.290 --> 00:51.290
Yeah, I know.

00:51.496 --> 00:53.797
<i>The assailant opened
fire on military personnel</i>

00:53.798 --> 00:56.193
<i>and their families at an
army promotion ceremony.</i>

00:56.194 --> 00:58.480
<i>Eyewitnesses report a local hero</i>

00:58.481 --> 01:01.320
<i>and active serviceman sprang into action</i>

01:01.321 --> 01:03.132
<i>and tackled the gunman to the floor.</i>

01:03.133 --> 01:04.885
<i>Dr. Drew Alister then courageously</i>

01:04.885 --> 01:06.180
<i>wrestled the weapon out
of the gunman's hand.</i>

01:06.181 --> 01:07.405
Yo, San Antonio, superman.

01:07.406 --> 01:08.336
Get over here, man!

01:08.337 --> 01:09.492
You're on TV! There he is!

01:09.493 --> 01:11.943
- Yeah!
- Not interested.

01:11.944 --> 01:13.503
Toph, what do you got?

01:13.504 --> 01:15.719
Hey, it's your call, Dr. Badass.

01:15.720 --> 01:17.191
"Dr. Badass."

01:17.192 --> 01:18.933
Um, abdominal rupture, Trauma One,

01:18.934 --> 01:20.019
hemorrhoids, curtain three.

01:20.935 --> 01:21.915
Easy choice.

01:21.916 --> 01:23.189
Oh, so I get the hemorrhoids?

01:23.190 --> 01:24.243
Not if you're careful.

01:24.244 --> 01:26.004
- See what I did?
- No, it's terrible.

01:26.005 --> 01:27.347
Hey, Paul.

01:27.348 --> 01:29.700
Uh, knee pain in the waiting room.

01:29.701 --> 01:30.733
- Okay.
- Thanks.

01:30.734 --> 01:31.543
- Hey, Tee?
- Yeah.

01:31.544 --> 01:33.675
Do me a favor. Uh, with
Jordan out at the conference,

01:33.676 --> 01:34.870
can you keep an eye on Paul tonight?

01:34.871 --> 01:36.058
Yes, of course, baby.

01:37.768 --> 01:38.768
Hello.

01:41.408 --> 01:42.408
Hello?

01:42.455 --> 01:43.530
Hey, Simone.

01:44.018 --> 01:46.235
- Oh, what? Why?
- Topher?! 32-year-old male

01:46.236 --> 01:47.561
with a deep laceration to his left arm!

01:47.562 --> 01:48.749
- Okay, Trauma Two!
- Got it.

01:48.750 --> 01:50.341
Okay, Brent just came in
the door. See you soon.

01:50.342 --> 01:51.330
Michael, you're with me.

01:51.331 --> 01:53.029
Brent, how are you feeling, brother?

01:53.030 --> 01:54.668
Stupid, mostly.

01:54.669 --> 01:55.663
You two know each other?

01:55.664 --> 01:57.087
We lived down the street from each other.

01:57.088 --> 01:57.971
What happened?

01:57.972 --> 01:59.859
Build a new dining table.
Next thing I knew...

01:59.860 --> 02:01.789
Pissed off a power saw
from the looks of it.

02:01.790 --> 02:03.642
- Yeah.
- His pulse is 115.

02:03.643 --> 02:05.146
B.P. 80 over 42.

02:05.147 --> 02:07.470
I started a saline bolus in the field.

02:07.471 --> 02:09.543
Simone's on her way. I guess
you left her quite a message.

02:09.544 --> 02:10.953
Only that I was headed to the E.R.

02:10.954 --> 02:12.208
That's always soothing.

02:12.209 --> 02:13.989
Heather, grab some O-Neg
from the blood bank.

02:13.990 --> 02:14.514
You got it.

02:14.515 --> 02:16.656
And 1, 2, 3.

02:20.978 --> 02:22.527
Gonna fix you right up, brother.

02:22.528 --> 02:24.405
Okay.

02:26.435 --> 02:27.938
Hey, uh, just checked with X-ray.

02:27.939 --> 02:29.483
Uh, Kaylee's up next.
Where... where is she?

02:29.484 --> 02:31.208
- She stepped out for a sec.
- Okay.

02:31.209 --> 02:32.599
Hey, guys, I'm right here.

02:32.600 --> 02:33.942
I thought you went to the bathroom.

02:33.943 --> 02:36.201
I did, but the vending
machine was on the way.

02:36.202 --> 02:37.493
Kaylee

02:37.494 --> 02:40.070
I swear, I don't allow
her to eat processed sugar.

02:40.071 --> 02:41.647
Sorry, I'm nervous.

02:41.648 --> 02:43.293
You know what getting into
this play means for me.

02:43.294 --> 02:44.701
Don't be so hard on yourself.

02:44.702 --> 02:45.746
Well, how about we make sure

02:45.747 --> 02:47.165
you don't have to hobble
onto the stage, okay?

02:47.165 --> 02:48.852
I believe your Tendinitis is flaring up.

02:48.853 --> 02:50.917
I'll give her some
prescription-strength Ibuprofen,

02:50.918 --> 02:52.741
and we'll do the X-ray
just to be safe, okay?

02:52.742 --> 02:53.866
Hi. I'm Dr. Callahan.

02:53.867 --> 02:54.702
Everything good here?

02:54.703 --> 02:55.938
Uh, yeah, I was just letting Kaylee know

02:55.939 --> 02:57.836
that I think her Tendinitis is coming back.

02:57.837 --> 02:59.267
The excess weight is putting
pressure on her joints.

02:59.268 --> 03:01.538
We're working on her diet
and trying to work out.

03:01.539 --> 03:02.554
Excuse me.

03:02.555 --> 03:03.838
Ready for the X-rays.

03:03.839 --> 03:05.794
Okay, thank you. Uh, after you.

03:06.630 --> 03:08.071
That is a cute dress.

03:08.072 --> 03:09.574
Thank you.

03:11.943 --> 03:13.638
Hold all my calls.

03:13.639 --> 03:15.780
Will do.

03:16.528 --> 03:17.617
I found this on him,

03:17.618 --> 03:19.433
and I left it 'cause it was spot-on.

03:19.729 --> 03:21.488
This is an army tactical tourniquet.

03:21.489 --> 03:24.182
Chuck Norris here travels
to bases around the country,

03:24.182 --> 03:25.188
training our troops.

03:25.189 --> 03:26.224
Kidding.

03:26.225 --> 03:28.714
Oh, combatives...
hand-to-hand combat.

03:29.410 --> 03:31.535
But it looks like I'm gonna be
out of commission for a while.

03:31.536 --> 03:32.907
Topher will fix you right up.

03:32.908 --> 03:34.860
All right, I'm out on another call, okay?

03:34.861 --> 03:35.564
Thanks, Gwen.

03:35.565 --> 03:37.768
Felt like an idiot for calling 911.

03:39.240 --> 03:41.635
I tried to drive myself, but
the arm wouldn't cooperate.

03:41.636 --> 03:44.257
You did the right thing.
Treatment plan, Michael?

03:44.258 --> 03:45.246
Irrigate the wound,

03:45.247 --> 03:47.991
assess for nerve,
tendon, and vessel damage,

03:47.992 --> 03:50.945
suture on multiple layers,
Tetanus, prophylaxis,

03:50.946 --> 03:52.861
- and antibiotics.
- Yes, after Morphine.

03:52.862 --> 03:54.612
We want to make sure
he's comfortable first.

03:56.386 --> 03:57.623
Simone is gonna kill me.

03:57.624 --> 04:00.358
Oh, man, that's right. Your
wedding's in a few weeks.

04:00.359 --> 04:01.513
And I look like I just walked

04:01.514 --> 04:02.937
out of one of those "Saw" movies.

04:05.946 --> 04:08.431
So, when I started my
residency, any given night,

04:08.432 --> 04:11.529
you would have, you know,
like a half a dozen shootings,

04:11.530 --> 04:14.732
a few stabbings, a steady
flow of crack addicts.

04:14.733 --> 04:15.856
I mean, it was great.

04:16.384 --> 04:17.367
For learning. It...

04:17.368 --> 04:19.197
- Of course.
- It was great for learning.

04:19.197 --> 04:20.401
- For learning.
- Yeah.

04:20.402 --> 04:22.200
No wonder you're so calm under pressure.

04:22.201 --> 04:22.995
To be honest with you,

04:22.996 --> 04:24.794
if you want to know what
makes me not so calm,

04:24.795 --> 04:28.014
it's this speech that I have to deliver

04:28.015 --> 04:29.671
in front of, what, half my mentors.

04:29.671 --> 04:30.591
It's freaking me out.

04:30.592 --> 04:32.787
You'll do great, really.

04:32.788 --> 04:35.053
And thank you so much
for inviting me to this conference.

04:35.054 --> 04:37.078
- Yeah.
- Because, outside of you,

04:37.079 --> 04:39.199
I-it's just really hard to
find good female role models

04:39.200 --> 04:40.187
when you're working the night shift.

04:40.188 --> 04:42.413
Tell me about it. It's
a bit of a sausage fest.

04:45.043 --> 04:46.552
You gonna meet some really great people,

04:46.553 --> 04:47.953
and there are some really strong...

04:50.453 --> 04:51.645
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God.

04:51.646 --> 04:53.084
- Call 911.
- Yeah.

04:54.232 --> 04:55.603
Damn it! There's still no reception.

04:55.604 --> 04:57.271
Just keep trying.

05:01.092 --> 05:02.029
I see him!

05:02.030 --> 05:03.030
Yeah?

05:04.852 --> 05:06.436
Sir?

05:08.407 --> 05:09.893
All right, his pulse is weak.

05:09.894 --> 05:10.866
I need to roll him over

05:10.867 --> 05:12.297
and check his airway
and examine his c-spine.

05:12.298 --> 05:13.589
Okay, I'll get the head. You get the side.

05:13.590 --> 05:14.225
Okay, on three.

05:14.226 --> 05:16.514
1, 2, 3.

05:17.931 --> 05:19.773
Okay, easy, easy.

05:20.665 --> 05:22.748
C-spine intact on palpation.

05:27.183 --> 05:28.292
Damn, this is bad.

05:28.293 --> 05:29.648
We need to stop the bleeding now.

05:29.649 --> 05:31.199
Oh, man.

05:31.994 --> 05:33.125
We need to get him out of here.

05:33.126 --> 05:34.207
Yeah, we do.

05:34.208 --> 05:36.579
So, I, uh, I see you got your Harley back.

05:37.035 --> 05:38.605
Yeah. Jordan will never allow that.

05:38.606 --> 05:40.653
Oh, Kenny, I'm not sure how
you handle your relationships,

05:40.654 --> 05:41.312
but Jordan and I... Help!

05:41.313 --> 05:43.262
Help, Doctor! We need help!

05:43.262 --> 05:44.262
- Doctor!
- Oh!

05:46.776 --> 05:48.789
- What happened?!
- I don't know. She just started seizing.

05:48.790 --> 05:50.113
- Can we get a gurney?
- Yeah, on it.

05:50.114 --> 05:53.207
Oh, my gosh,
Kaylee! Doctors, help her.

05:54.473 --> 05:55.473
Make it stop.

Learn the unknown English words
of this movie at www.skeebdo.com

06:15.892 --> 06:18.166
Temp is 103 now, persistent cough.

06:18.167 --> 06:20.377
Been fighting the flu for a couple weeks.

06:20.757 --> 06:21.978
That's probably why I got lightheaded

06:21.979 --> 06:22.818
with the saw in my hand.

06:22.819 --> 06:24.464
Is the light bothering your eyes?

06:25.049 --> 06:27.168
I wouldn't say "bothering." I just...

06:27.169 --> 06:28.324
I notice it.

06:28.325 --> 06:29.288
Do you have a headache?

06:29.289 --> 06:30.123
Nothing I can't handle.

06:30.124 --> 06:31.356
Brent, it's me here, okay?

06:31.357 --> 06:32.480
No time to be a tough guy.

06:32.481 --> 06:34.206
I need to know if you
have a headache or not.

06:34.207 --> 06:35.872
Yeah.

06:36.669 --> 06:38.236
For a few weeks now.

06:38.992 --> 06:40.782
Okay, I'd like to do a spinal tap.

06:40.783 --> 06:42.995
A what? Why?

06:42.996 --> 06:45.596
Because fever, headache,
and light sensitivity

06:45.597 --> 06:47.891
may indicate something much
more serious than the flu.

06:47.892 --> 06:49.873
Temp is spiking. 104 and climbing.

06:49.874 --> 06:51.185
Okay, we need to do this now.

06:53.546 --> 06:54.541
Uh, we're headed to Trauma One!

06:54.542 --> 06:55.671
Okay, I'm gonna move you onto your side.

06:55.672 --> 06:56.670
Keep your airway unobstructed.

06:56.671 --> 06:58.669
Paul, I'm gonna need a
10 of Diazepam. Right.

06:58.670 --> 06:59.826
Did I miss something?

06:59.826 --> 07:01.348
Well, leg pain doesn't
usually cause a seizure, but...

07:01.349 --> 07:03.176
Seizure?! I don't know what happened!

07:03.177 --> 07:05.421
- She was just fine!
- She's gonna be okay.

07:06.866 --> 07:07.838
Okay, hold still, brother.

07:07.839 --> 07:08.874
I know it's gonna be uncomfortable,

07:08.875 --> 07:09.875
but you're doing great.

07:10.284 --> 07:11.232
Almost there.

07:11.233 --> 07:12.398
Oh, I can take it.

07:12.399 --> 07:14.108
I came as soon as I could!

07:14.109 --> 07:15.160
Hey, Simone.

07:15.161 --> 07:16.229
What the hell?

07:16.576 --> 07:19.047
My God, Brent, you said
you just cut yourself.

07:19.048 --> 07:20.965
I did, but they stitched
me up good. I'm fine.

07:20.966 --> 07:23.262
Okay, guys, if you can
just hold the discussion

07:23.263 --> 07:24.716
for a few more moments while I finish.

07:24.717 --> 07:25.605
I'm sorry, Topher.

07:25.605 --> 07:27.426
There's a gigantic needle in his spine.

07:27.427 --> 07:29.517
- What's going on?
- Babe, let him do his job.

07:29.518 --> 07:31.102
Okay, take that to the
lab, please, Heather.

07:31.103 --> 07:32.103
Yes, Doctor.

07:32.425 --> 07:33.486
Lie back down.

07:33.487 --> 07:34.487
Here.

07:36.824 --> 07:37.824
All right.

07:38.411 --> 07:39.571
Hey. Here's where we're at.

07:39.572 --> 07:41.329
We expect the arm to heal nicely.

07:41.330 --> 07:43.569
There wasn't any nerve damage from the saw.

07:43.570 --> 07:44.328
But...

07:44.329 --> 07:45.329
Here comes the "but."

07:46.100 --> 07:48.070
Y-you have symptoms of meningitis.

07:48.071 --> 07:50.203
We'll know for sure as soon as
we get the spinal-tap results.

07:50.204 --> 07:52.110
Oh, my God, that's...
That's serious, right?

07:52.111 --> 07:53.202
It can be.

07:53.203 --> 07:55.531
Um, but we've started him on antibiotics

07:55.532 --> 07:56.519
in case it's bacterial.

07:56.520 --> 07:58.490
In case? I mean, are you guessing?

07:58.491 --> 07:59.782
Listen, please.

07:59.783 --> 08:00.823
Sorry if I'm curious

08:00.824 --> 08:02.063
about the health of
my soon-to-be husband.

08:02.064 --> 08:04.214
- Is that a crime?
- No, it's not.

08:04.541 --> 08:06.523
It can be any number of things.

08:06.524 --> 08:09.532
Let's get the labs first,
and we'll go from there, okay?

08:09.533 --> 08:10.778
Okay.

08:11.830 --> 08:13.971
<i>Sources say Alister's heroics extend</i>

08:13.972 --> 08:15.512
<i>even further than the trauma room.</i>

08:15.513 --> 08:16.548
<i>In his personal life,</i>

08:16.549 --> 08:19.738
<i>Alister cared for his boyfriend
after a leg amputation.</i>

08:20.058 --> 08:21.822
Don't they have any real news to report?

08:21.823 --> 08:24.108
That was real news! Man, you are a hero!

08:24.109 --> 08:25.792
People like knowing there
are guys like you out there.

08:25.793 --> 08:26.793
Yeah, too many people.

08:27.289 --> 08:28.077
Last day and a half,

08:28.078 --> 08:29.867
I've had random guys cyber hitting on me,

08:29.868 --> 08:31.419
women trying to convert me,

08:31.420 --> 08:33.760
conservatives hoping to
shame me out of the military.

08:33.761 --> 08:35.075
Yeah, so now is probably not a good time

08:35.076 --> 08:37.130
to let you know that local
TV channels and express

08:37.131 --> 08:38.155
have called like a hundred times,

08:38.155 --> 08:39.287
asking for interviews, huh?

08:39.845 --> 08:41.318
Tell them that I'm not talking to anybody

08:41.318 --> 08:42.253
and I just want to be left alone.

08:42.254 --> 08:43.558
Hey, I didn't say I was your secretary.

08:43.559 --> 08:45.241
Just letting you know what they said, man.

08:57.560 --> 08:58.902
<i>Your call has been forwarded</i>

08:58.903 --> 09:00.463
<i>to an automated voice messaging system.</i>

09:01.204 --> 09:02.263
Rick, it's me.

09:02.264 --> 09:04.726
I don't know if you've seen
the news, but if you have...

09:05.260 --> 09:06.589
Sorry you got dragged into this.

09:06.590 --> 09:08.544
I have no idea how they
got that picture of us.

09:08.545 --> 09:10.687
I don't know how they found out
about us, so... hope you well.

09:10.687 --> 09:13.149
So, Kaylee had what's
called a grand mal seizure,

09:13.150 --> 09:14.671
But she's stable now.

09:15.152 --> 09:16.913
- What caused that?
- We don't know yet.

09:16.914 --> 09:18.463
We have to run some more tests.

09:18.464 --> 09:20.372
- Can I see her?
- Yeah.

09:20.373 --> 09:23.294
Uh, Jocelyn, can you...
Can you join us, please?

09:24.960 --> 09:26.315
Honey! What are you...

09:26.316 --> 09:28.489
I'm sorry, mom. I can't stop. I'm starving.

09:29.036 --> 09:30.563
How can you still be hungry?

09:30.564 --> 09:31.554
You already ate a full meal.

09:31.555 --> 09:33.193
Kaylee, can I examine your stomach?

09:33.486 --> 09:35.864
- Okay.
- I don't know what to do.

09:36.490 --> 09:39.697
She just keeps eating more
and more, no matter what I do.

09:40.499 --> 09:42.304
What's going on?

09:45.160 --> 09:46.636
Faggot!

09:46.637 --> 09:48.777
You are such a faggot!

09:49.378 --> 09:50.397
- Shut up, man.
- Dude, why are you...

09:50.397 --> 09:51.904
Hey!

09:54.262 --> 09:55.412
What did we do?

09:57.919 --> 09:59.291
Watch your mouth.

10:10.475 --> 10:12.768
All right, drive fast, Krista.
He's bleeding like crazy.

10:12.769 --> 10:13.988
Mm-hmm.

10:17.440 --> 10:20.054
Okay, pupils are equal and reactive.

10:20.055 --> 10:21.306
It's a good sign.

10:22.197 --> 10:23.208
Hey.

10:23.593 --> 10:24.482
Welcome back.

10:24.483 --> 10:25.936
Where... where am I?

10:25.937 --> 10:28.790
You were in an accident.
Can you tell me your name?

10:28.791 --> 10:32.326
- Joe... Joe Koller.
- Okay, Joe, you stay with me.

10:32.327 --> 10:33.577
My name's Dr. Alexander,

10:33.578 --> 10:35.848
and Dr. Bell-Hart is
driving us to the hospital.

10:35.849 --> 10:37.152
We're gonna give you
something for your pain.

10:37.153 --> 10:39.514
Good. 'Cause it-it's killing me.

10:39.515 --> 10:40.854
All right, Krista, look in my glove box.

10:40.855 --> 10:41.844
There's Benadryl.

10:41.845 --> 10:43.286
Hand it to me, and then tell me why.

10:44.589 --> 10:46.092
All right, so, it's an antihistamine,

10:46.093 --> 10:47.791
but it can be used as a local anesthetic.

10:47.792 --> 10:49.079
Do you need, um, a syringe?

10:49.080 --> 10:50.811
Yes.

10:51.411 --> 10:52.625
Here you go.

10:54.595 --> 10:57.377
You inject it near the
wound, and it blocks the pain.

10:59.315 --> 11:00.315
All right.

11:00.750 --> 11:03.267
Joe, this is gonna burn a little bit,

11:03.268 --> 11:05.032
but I need you to be tough
so that we can help you.

11:05.033 --> 11:06.491
- Can you do that for me?
- Okay.

11:06.492 --> 11:07.492
- Okay.
- Damn it.

11:07.713 --> 11:08.785
There's still no reception.

11:08.786 --> 11:10.966
W-we're a good 40 miles away
from the nearest hospital.

11:11.326 --> 11:12.955
Just keep flooring it.

11:23.951 --> 11:25.655
And you just feel like
you can't stop eating.

11:25.656 --> 11:26.933
You're... You're powerless?

11:26.934 --> 11:28.473
Because I'm always starving.

11:28.474 --> 11:29.859
So, you never feel full?

11:29.860 --> 11:30.811
Not really.

11:30.812 --> 11:33.253
On a scale from 1 to 10,
my hunger level is a 20.

11:33.254 --> 11:34.534
- Here you go, sweetie.
- Thanks.

11:34.864 --> 11:36.379
I know what you're thinking.

11:36.380 --> 11:38.043
You see me overweight, and you think,

11:38.044 --> 11:39.684
"like mother, like daughter,"

11:39.685 --> 11:41.412
but I try to feed her
fruits and vegetables.

11:41.413 --> 11:42.686
We're not thinking anything, ma'am.

11:42.687 --> 11:45.272
She started gaining weight
when her dad and I split up.

11:45.651 --> 11:46.866
Her counselor at school thinks

11:46.867 --> 11:49.102
her overeating is a coping mechanism.

11:49.103 --> 11:51.961
We've tried everything...
low carb, no carb, the zone.

11:51.962 --> 11:54.129
Okay, well, it sounds like
you're doing everything right.

11:54.130 --> 11:55.288
We're only asking these questions

11:55.289 --> 11:56.661
so we can try and help Kaylee.

11:56.662 --> 11:58.999
- Any illnesses, uh, surgeries?
- No.

11:59.000 --> 12:00.599
She's always been a really healthy kid.

12:01.030 --> 12:02.579
Actually, she has her dad's body.

12:02.580 --> 12:04.855
He's thin. And then...

12:05.419 --> 12:08.298
A few years ago, she, you
know, started getting bigger.

12:08.299 --> 12:10.897
She's trying to say that's when
I morphed into fatty pork chops.

12:10.898 --> 12:13.108
Please, K, don't talk
about yourself that way.

12:13.109 --> 12:14.145
Hey, y-you really shouldn't.

12:14.146 --> 12:15.786
Let's just stick to the task at hand,

12:15.787 --> 12:17.928
which is trying to figure out
why Kaylee's had her seizures.

12:17.929 --> 12:19.006
We're gonna run some blood work

12:19.006 --> 12:22.370
and an M.R.I., and we'll work it out, okay?

12:24.928 --> 12:26.206
You good with this?

12:31.261 --> 12:33.627
Hey, where do I know you from?

12:34.591 --> 12:37.129
Well, you've been in
here about a dozen times

12:37.129 --> 12:39.142
over the past couple years,
so I'd start with that.

12:39.143 --> 12:40.842
No, that ain't it.

12:41.283 --> 12:42.627
You're that guy.

12:42.628 --> 12:44.118
Yeah, I'm a guy. Open up.

12:44.119 --> 12:45.255
No, that guy that kicked

12:45.256 --> 12:47.670
that other dude's ass when he
was shooting at people, right?

12:48.028 --> 12:50.695
- Am I right? I'm right, right?
- Yeah, sir, you're right.

12:50.696 --> 12:52.119
Let's just stick out your tongue.

12:52.120 --> 12:53.078
Let's finish the exam.

12:53.079 --> 12:54.160
Uh, actually,

12:54.731 --> 12:56.473
can I have another doctor?

12:56.474 --> 12:57.833
Why do you want another doc?

12:57.834 --> 13:00.210
I don't feel comfortable
having a gay dude touch me...

13:00.211 --> 13:01.187
Nothing personal.

13:01.188 --> 13:02.663
It gives me the heebie-jeebies.

13:03.503 --> 13:04.989
So, let me get this straight.

13:05.512 --> 13:07.338
You, a homeless drug addict,

13:07.339 --> 13:09.383
has a problem with me touching you?

13:09.384 --> 13:10.384
Yeah.

13:10.889 --> 13:12.560
I don't want you near my junk.

13:12.561 --> 13:13.775
You have a sore throat.

13:13.776 --> 13:15.528
I'm not going anywhere near your junk.

13:15.528 --> 13:17.671
I want a new doc.

13:19.017 --> 13:20.519
I'll put you back in the queue.

13:22.440 --> 13:24.327
Get you a new doctor.

13:24.328 --> 13:27.175
Mmm, this is nice.

13:31.350 --> 13:33.148
Hey, whoa, Drew!

13:33.149 --> 13:34.415
Drew, what's... What's going on, man?

13:34.416 --> 13:35.840
No good deed goes unpunished!

13:35.841 --> 13:37.289
You try to do something good,

13:37.290 --> 13:39.737
and the media, they grab
it, and they just spoil it!

13:39.738 --> 13:40.813
What are you talking about, man?

13:40.814 --> 13:43.608
I just got kicked out of an
exam room by a homeless guy.

13:43.609 --> 13:44.350
Why?

13:44.351 --> 13:45.857
'Cause he didn't want a
gay doctor touching him.

13:45.858 --> 13:48.764
I have treated that guy thousands of times!

13:49.377 --> 13:51.424
Didn't have a problem with
it, but now that he knows...

13:51.425 --> 13:53.048
So what, man? He's just
one deluded junkie, man.

13:53.049 --> 13:55.874
It's not gonna be just that guy!

13:55.875 --> 13:58.000
There's gonna be more. You know it.

13:59.141 --> 14:01.928
- I'm just the gay doctor to everyone.
- So?

14:01.929 --> 14:03.456
How would you like to be the black nurse?

14:03.456 --> 14:04.901
I am a black nurse.

14:05.821 --> 14:07.066
And?

14:08.078 --> 14:10.119
- What else you got?
- I just want my privacy back.

14:10.120 --> 14:12.701
I want my life back. I
don't want any part of this.

14:12.702 --> 14:15.736
Look, Drew, look, I know
you're a private guy, man,

14:15.737 --> 14:17.148
but I'm sorry.

14:17.149 --> 14:18.464
That ship has sailed,

14:18.465 --> 14:19.420
and I got to say,

14:19.421 --> 14:20.996
ever since you came out last year,

14:20.997 --> 14:23.040
it's like you still got
one foot in the closet, man.

14:23.041 --> 14:24.690
So, what, are you some sort of expert now?

14:24.691 --> 14:26.384
I am on one of my best friends.

14:26.758 --> 14:29.808
And I know you got to stop
hiding behind this privacy thing

14:29.809 --> 14:31.844
and step up and use this as an opportunity

14:31.845 --> 14:33.661
to let people know who you are, man.

14:33.661 --> 14:34.526
That's not who I am!

14:34.527 --> 14:37.516
That is who you are! That is who you are!

14:37.517 --> 14:39.294
Man, you served your country!

14:39.295 --> 14:40.723
You took care of your troops in battle!

14:40.724 --> 14:41.724
You're a doctor!

14:42.171 --> 14:43.896
You, my friend, are a caregiver

14:43.897 --> 14:46.650
from the very bottom of that
thing beating in your chest,

14:46.651 --> 14:48.798
and you have a
responsibility to be counted,

14:48.799 --> 14:51.291
a responsibility to fight
this bigotry head on.

14:51.665 --> 14:52.926
N-not just for yourself

14:53.495 --> 14:56.420
but, more importantly,
man, for those who can't.

14:57.360 --> 15:00.340
And that, I-I do know a
little something about.

15:13.695 --> 15:15.426
We're losing his pulse.

15:15.427 --> 15:16.935
Bleeder must be in the retro peritoneum.

15:16.936 --> 15:18.388
I think his aorta is leaking.

15:18.389 --> 15:19.862
I'm driving as fast as I can.

15:19.863 --> 15:23.533
I-I need something to simulate
an abdominal aortic tourniquet.

15:23.533 --> 15:25.992
I could use this seat belt.

15:25.993 --> 15:28.605
I need to apply pressure into the wound.

15:28.606 --> 15:30.446
- You need something inflatable, right?
- Yeah.

15:30.538 --> 15:31.954
Okay, okay, that bag right there,

15:31.955 --> 15:33.176
um, I was bringing toys for my niece.

15:33.177 --> 15:34.516
I got her a water balloon launcher.

15:34.517 --> 15:35.608
- Are you serious?
- Yes!

15:39.942 --> 15:41.542
All right, this balloon's going to work.

15:42.339 --> 15:43.579
I hope so.

15:46.924 --> 15:48.484
All right, stay with me, Joe.

15:48.485 --> 15:51.298
This is gonna hurt a
little, but it's gonna help.

15:53.219 --> 15:54.711
This should hold him for now,

15:54.712 --> 15:56.472
but I really need to open him up asap.

15:56.473 --> 15:57.762
Y-you can't open him up in the back.

15:57.763 --> 16:00.838
We'll have to do it somewhere,
or he's going to die.

16:01.700 --> 16:02.734
Hey, guys.

16:02.735 --> 16:04.697
The prelim spinal-tap results

16:04.698 --> 16:06.554
do look like bacterial meningitis,

16:06.555 --> 16:08.159
but we're still waiting for the cultures.

16:08.160 --> 16:10.108
- My God.
- You're already getting antibiotics,

16:10.109 --> 16:11.929
so you should start to feel better soon.

16:11.929 --> 16:13.510
His temp's going up. It's 106.

16:13.511 --> 16:16.486
Going up? Is he getting
the right dose of the meds?

16:16.487 --> 16:17.577
Yes.

16:18.708 --> 16:20.316
My legs are going numb.

16:20.317 --> 16:22.201
- Topher, is that normal?
- It's not bacterial.

16:22.202 --> 16:24.076
He should be responding
to the antibiotics by now.

16:24.077 --> 16:25.690
- What's wrong with him?
- We're gonna find out.

16:25.691 --> 16:27.782
L-let's give him steroids,
and add an antiviral.

16:27.783 --> 16:29.080
You got it.

16:29.550 --> 16:31.750
Could it be something he
picked up in a foreign country?

16:32.044 --> 16:32.645
Simone...

16:32.646 --> 16:33.460
Could it?

16:33.461 --> 16:34.808
Is there something you
should be telling me?

16:34.809 --> 16:36.069
Let's not get ahead of ourselves.

16:36.069 --> 16:37.550
No, no, no, I'm not being quiet here.

16:37.896 --> 16:39.363
Okay, you came home, and
you started feeling sick,

16:39.364 --> 16:41.450
so just... just tell him where you were.

16:41.451 --> 16:42.986
I know you were at Fort Bragg recently.

16:42.987 --> 16:44.182
Did you also leave the country?

16:44.183 --> 16:47.276
Brent, please just tell
him where you really were.

16:48.117 --> 16:48.825
He was overseas.

16:48.826 --> 16:50.792
- Simone, don't.
- He's special ops.

16:50.793 --> 16:52.709
He's not a-a Roving instructor.

16:52.710 --> 16:53.802
Oh, for the love of God, Simone.

16:53.803 --> 16:54.861
He won't tell me anything.

16:54.862 --> 16:56.666
He can't tell me anything ever.

16:57.514 --> 16:58.546
It's his job, and I get it,

16:58.547 --> 17:01.340
but this started when he
came back, and now he's sick.

17:01.640 --> 17:03.270
I'm sorry, babe. I'm sorry, Topher,

17:03.271 --> 17:04.710
- that we kept this secret.
- I understand.

17:04.711 --> 17:05.680
Look, right now,

17:05.681 --> 17:08.930
anything you say could
help before it's too late.

17:08.931 --> 17:10.021
You know me.

17:10.022 --> 17:11.462
Nothing you say leaves this room.

17:12.742 --> 17:14.662
Tell him. Please.

17:22.259 --> 17:24.594
My best buddy, Troy, and
I, we were hanging out.

17:26.900 --> 17:28.831
Talking about how
terrible the fake beer is.

17:28.832 --> 17:29.930
One thing I don't miss

17:29.931 --> 17:31.710
about deployment's the nonalcoholic beer.

17:31.711 --> 17:32.934
Exactly.

17:33.461 --> 17:34.972
It all sucks.

17:36.261 --> 17:38.638
Our Humvee got hit by an I.E.D.

17:40.966 --> 17:42.340
Killed everyone.

17:43.564 --> 17:44.454
Brent...

17:44.455 --> 17:46.601
This is why I don't tell you things.

17:47.564 --> 17:48.953
I mean, I know I can't.

17:48.954 --> 17:51.122
Walked away with minor damage.

17:53.032 --> 17:55.130
I had shrapnel in my
upper chest and my neck.

17:56.873 --> 17:59.049
They got the metal out at
the center at Landstuhl.

17:59.049 --> 18:00.551
How long ago did this happen?

18:00.552 --> 18:01.885
Six weeks.

18:03.739 --> 18:04.666
Does that help?

18:04.667 --> 18:06.369
Yeah.

18:06.370 --> 18:08.017
I think it might.

18:09.568 --> 18:13.310
We're gonna get you an
M.R.I. and some more X-rays.

18:19.661 --> 18:24.105
Okeydokey. Mr. Licorice and
Mrs. Marshmallow are all set.

18:24.106 --> 18:25.741
That's one a day each after meals.

18:25.741 --> 18:28.391
You should notice a spring
in their hop in no time.

18:28.392 --> 18:31.992
I need your biggest
gurney and an O.R... now!

18:34.238 --> 18:35.904
How did you get my number?

18:36.670 --> 18:38.609
No, I'm not doing any interviews.

18:38.610 --> 18:40.567
Stop calling me, and don't call the E.R.

18:40.568 --> 18:42.325
Because we're trying to
get some work done here.

18:42.326 --> 18:44.857
Doctor Alister?

18:47.644 --> 18:49.823
Aren't you gonna answer that?

18:53.533 --> 18:54.778
Rick.

18:54.779 --> 18:57.726
So you recognized me. That's a good start.

18:57.727 --> 18:58.762
Yeah.

19:02.930 --> 19:04.812
Let me just get someone to cover for me.

19:05.621 --> 19:07.833
But do you eat anything besides grits?

19:08.167 --> 19:09.208
Why would I?

19:09.209 --> 19:11.316
Talking about cheese, bacon,

19:11.317 --> 19:13.111
green onions, with smoked sausage.

19:13.112 --> 19:14.262
Mmm!

19:14.263 --> 19:15.594
Mmm!

19:15.595 --> 19:17.668
Oh, honestly, I could eat
that morning, noon, and night.

19:17.669 --> 19:18.888
- Okay, okay.
- I'm serious.

19:18.889 --> 19:20.840
But next time, I'm picking the restaurant.

19:22.057 --> 19:23.662
As long as they got grits. All I'm saying.

19:23.663 --> 19:24.978
Grits.

19:25.827 --> 19:27.443
Emergency medic...

19:27.444 --> 19:29.523
Whoa, whoa, whoa, okay,
slow down, slow down.

19:30.122 --> 19:32.132
All right, who are you?

19:33.304 --> 19:34.304
Where?

19:35.151 --> 19:36.077
All right, got it.

19:36.078 --> 19:36.810
What's up?

19:36.811 --> 19:38.173
Jordan and Krista brought in an M.V.A.

19:38.174 --> 19:39.803
to an animal clinic out on 281.

19:39.804 --> 19:40.892
I need a MedEvac STAT.

19:40.893 --> 19:42.171
All right, I'm heading out.

19:42.172 --> 19:43.999
- Call me with the address.
- I got you.

19:44.000 --> 19:46.427
<i>Paging Dr. Statham. Dr. Statham, please.</i>

19:47.206 --> 19:51.252
Just keep breathing,
Kaylee. Only be a bit longer.

19:51.253 --> 19:53.810
Here's your lesson for the night, Paul.

19:53.811 --> 19:55.445
Never bring your bias into the exam room.

19:55.446 --> 19:57.338
All I saw was a girl with knee problems

19:57.339 --> 19:58.206
because she was overweight.

19:58.207 --> 19:59.614
Yeah, as did I.

19:59.615 --> 20:01.976
Her mom was right. I
judged her and her mother.

20:02.511 --> 20:04.261
I just saw an obese girl eating candy

20:04.262 --> 20:06.640
and never considered there
could be something more going on.

20:07.178 --> 20:09.436
Could've asked a hundred
questions, and I didn't.

20:09.437 --> 20:11.594
Do you think you could've
predicted the seizures?

20:11.595 --> 20:12.583
We'll never know,

20:12.584 --> 20:15.196
but I know we won't make
the same mistake again.

20:15.197 --> 20:16.358
Such a cool kid.

20:17.536 --> 20:19.693
Son of a bitch. See that?

20:20.475 --> 20:21.694
Oh, man.

20:24.531 --> 20:27.057
Yeah.

20:29.995 --> 20:30.812
I called my owner.

20:30.813 --> 20:32.118
He said I can't let you guys in here.

20:32.119 --> 20:34.085
Pushing 10 of Morphine. Any Propofol?

20:34.086 --> 20:36.522
Uh, yeah. It's for the
big dogs. It's over here.

20:36.523 --> 20:37.755
All right, hand it to me.

20:37.756 --> 20:39.225
Come on, 80 milligrams.

20:40.841 --> 20:42.968
Hey, hey, don't go anywhere.
We're gonna need your help.

20:42.969 --> 20:44.788
I can't. I just do animals.

20:44.789 --> 20:46.605
If it's an emergency, I call the vet.

20:46.606 --> 20:48.091
All right, sweetie, what's your name?

20:48.092 --> 20:49.538
- Carl.
- Propofol in.

20:49.539 --> 20:50.947
All right, Carl, you're freaking out,

20:50.948 --> 20:51.920
and I don't blame you,

20:51.921 --> 20:54.042
but we need to help this kid pull through,

20:54.043 --> 20:55.614
or I'm gonna have to call his mother

20:55.614 --> 20:57.138
and tell her that he died.

20:57.139 --> 20:58.683
Now, tell me, would you want your mother

20:58.684 --> 21:00.132
to get that kind of phone call about you?

21:00.133 --> 21:02.422
- Oh, no way. She'd go nuts.
- That's what I thought.

21:02.423 --> 21:05.401
So, you're just gonna have
to take a very deep breath.

21:05.402 --> 21:06.295
Get a hold of yourself

21:06.296 --> 21:07.848
'cause you are gonna help us save this kid.

21:07.849 --> 21:08.785
Okay, I'm in.

21:08.786 --> 21:10.252
Just... just don't make me touch anything.

21:10.253 --> 21:10.942
All right, Krista,

21:10.943 --> 21:12.269
you just finished your surgical rotation.

21:12.270 --> 21:13.747
- Are you ready to do this?
- Hand me the 10 blade.

21:13.748 --> 21:14.748
Here you go.

21:17.483 --> 21:20.667
Okay now take the incision
down to the rectus muscle.

21:22.174 --> 21:23.507
Deep breath, Carl.

21:28.580 --> 21:31.365
Okay, so, you see this white area here?

21:31.366 --> 21:33.032
It's a tumor in her pituitary gland

21:33.033 --> 21:34.154
pushing on the hypothalamus.

21:34.423 --> 21:35.925
- A tumor.
- Mm-hmm.

21:35.926 --> 21:37.776
Oh, my god, Kaylee has brain cancer.

21:37.777 --> 21:39.417
Oh, no, don't... Don't go down that road.

21:39.512 --> 21:40.764
The mass is probably benign,

21:40.765 --> 21:42.321
but it has grown big enough
to cause some bleeding.

21:42.322 --> 21:43.946
It's also what caused the seizure,

21:44.483 --> 21:46.369
which is why we need to have
it removed as soon as possible.

21:46.370 --> 21:48.218
But the good news is
that we believe the tumor

21:48.219 --> 21:49.772
is the cause of her insatiable appetite.

21:49.773 --> 21:51.473
It's what's called hypothalamic obesity.

21:51.474 --> 21:52.743
That's good news?

21:53.125 --> 21:55.043
Yeah, the... the tumor's
in a part of the brain

21:55.044 --> 21:57.211
that tells us when we're
hungry and when we're not.

21:57.212 --> 21:58.604
We believe that's why
she's always starving.

21:58.605 --> 21:59.690
So when it's removed,

21:59.691 --> 22:01.378
her appetite will return to normal.

22:01.379 --> 22:03.435
- But brain surgery...
- I know it sounds scary,

22:03.436 --> 22:05.168
but they go right through the
nose, and they take it out.

22:05.169 --> 22:08.059
It's relatively simple. This could fix her.

22:08.060 --> 22:11.154
It takes about an hour. Okay?

22:11.155 --> 22:13.008
I saw all the news coverage on you.

22:13.630 --> 22:14.992
Past couple days are so...

22:15.954 --> 22:16.465
On us.

22:16.466 --> 22:17.815
I meant what I said in the voice mail.

22:17.816 --> 22:18.896
I didn't give them the picture of us.

22:18.897 --> 22:19.856
- I didn't...
- Drew...

22:19.857 --> 22:21.162
talk to them about us.

22:21.163 --> 22:22.798
I don't care about the damn picture.

22:23.685 --> 22:24.766
I can only imagine what hell

22:24.767 --> 22:26.287
the past couple days have been on you.

22:27.429 --> 22:28.616
Beyond my worst nightmare.

22:28.617 --> 22:30.386
Which is why I hopped on the last red-eye.

22:30.387 --> 22:31.750
That's why I didn't return your calls.

22:31.751 --> 22:32.666
I was flying.

22:32.666 --> 22:34.581
So you flew here to be with me?

22:34.582 --> 22:36.142
No, I came for the great hospital food.

22:36.723 --> 22:38.001
What do you think?

22:39.005 --> 22:40.280
Look...

22:41.084 --> 22:44.245
When I left, I had to get my life together.

22:44.246 --> 22:46.067
I did think some things through.

22:46.068 --> 22:47.727
Yeah, I mean, you've been through a lot.

22:47.728 --> 22:49.315
Yeah.

22:49.701 --> 22:51.949
Had to rethink, redefine who I am.

22:52.862 --> 22:55.350
Had to set things right with my parents.

22:55.740 --> 22:57.695
My mom, she always kind of knew.

22:58.351 --> 22:59.614
Dad, uh...

23:00.587 --> 23:01.747
He's getting there.

23:01.748 --> 23:03.505
That's great.

23:04.014 --> 23:06.956
I mean, I know how heavily
that weighed on you.

23:07.475 --> 23:09.961
You know what else weighed on me is us.

23:12.974 --> 23:15.308
I realized how much I need you in my life.

23:16.756 --> 23:18.643
I want us to be together again.

23:18.644 --> 23:19.894
So do I.

23:20.808 --> 23:21.829
But...

23:22.205 --> 23:24.357
- But?
- Not like it was before.

23:24.358 --> 23:25.358
I'm out.

23:26.467 --> 23:27.950
My platoon... they don't care.

23:28.598 --> 23:30.264
I bled with them. I almost died with them.

23:30.265 --> 23:31.083
They're my brothers.

23:31.084 --> 23:33.585
So, what do you mean
not like it was before?

23:33.586 --> 23:36.357
I mean, when we're together
around other people.

23:36.358 --> 23:38.603
Okay, a-all my friends,
they, uh, they know about you.

23:38.604 --> 23:41.378
I'm not talking about
here in your safe cocoon,

23:41.379 --> 23:43.697
surrounded by your supporting friends.

23:45.179 --> 23:48.202
I'm talking about in the world.

23:48.203 --> 23:50.606
I'm talking about us...

23:50.607 --> 23:54.225
Standing 10 feet apart when
we get a hotel room on vacation

23:54.226 --> 23:57.666
or not sitting beside each
other at the movie theater or...

23:58.913 --> 24:00.464
Or holding each other's hand.

24:00.465 --> 24:01.522
I'm a private person.

24:01.523 --> 24:03.807
That's what I used to tell myself, too.

24:06.514 --> 24:08.145
God, life is too short.

24:08.710 --> 24:10.654
It feels so good to just live

24:10.655 --> 24:13.622
and not worry about
what other people think.

24:13.623 --> 24:14.803
I want to be with you.

24:14.804 --> 24:17.883
We have to stop worrying about
what the rest of the world thinks.

24:18.752 --> 24:20.045
I can't live like that anymore.

24:20.046 --> 24:21.153
I just can't.

24:21.800 --> 24:23.723
Uh, excuse me, gents.

24:23.724 --> 24:24.928
Hey, Drew, I got a tool laceration

24:24.929 --> 24:25.629
for you in curtain four.

24:25.630 --> 24:26.938
All right, I'll be right there.

24:26.939 --> 24:28.073
Good seeing you, Rick.

24:28.073 --> 24:29.338
You too, Kenny.

24:35.258 --> 24:36.562
Anyway, uh...

24:37.798 --> 24:39.442
I said what I came to say.

24:40.645 --> 24:41.645
So...

24:45.463 --> 24:46.677
let me know.

25:06.031 --> 25:07.950
Oh, Toph, hey.

25:08.684 --> 25:11.239
I just got off the phone with
the American embassy in Dubai.

25:11.240 --> 25:12.943
They are processing your visa,

25:12.944 --> 25:14.918
but they are still working on Ali's.

25:14.919 --> 25:15.941
Thanks for taking care of that.

25:15.942 --> 25:16.696
No problem.

25:16.697 --> 25:18.230
Any word on Jordan and Krista?

25:18.231 --> 25:19.037
No.

25:19.038 --> 25:20.987
Not since the guy from
the animal hospital called,

25:20.988 --> 25:22.270
freaking out.

25:22.271 --> 25:24.347
Gwen just headed out,
but that's all I know.

25:24.348 --> 25:27.867
Oh. Your trauma scans
for Brent just came in.

25:28.309 --> 25:29.595
Come take a look.

25:31.003 --> 25:33.835
All right, here's his chest X-ray.

25:34.787 --> 25:37.216
Oh, wait, stop.

25:37.217 --> 25:38.849
There it is. See that?

25:40.120 --> 25:43.101
That's a foreign body.
Brent was in an explosion.

25:43.102 --> 25:46.171
Nice shrapnel. That looks like bone.

25:46.678 --> 25:48.309
Good eye. It is.

25:48.821 --> 25:50.986
But you said it was a foreign body.

25:50.987 --> 25:52.800
Because it's not his bone.

25:54.136 --> 25:55.355
That's Troy.

25:55.356 --> 25:57.013
My god, how did that even get there?

25:57.014 --> 25:58.351
It's from the explosion, right?

25:58.868 --> 25:59.190
Yeah.

25:59.191 --> 26:01.578
I've seen a whole lot of things
embedded in soldiers' bodies

26:01.579 --> 26:02.676
from I.E.D.s, but...

26:02.677 --> 26:03.832
It's called bio-shrapnel,

26:04.383 --> 26:06.555
which is probably the
source of your infection.

26:06.556 --> 26:08.654
We need to get you to
surgery as soon as possible

26:08.655 --> 26:10.135
to extract it and send it to the lab.

26:10.627 --> 26:12.278
So, he's... He's gonna be okay now?

26:12.279 --> 26:13.379
Well, he's not out of the woods yet.

26:13.380 --> 26:14.761
We need to do a blood transfusion.

26:14.762 --> 26:17.916
The infection caused your
body to start breaking down.

26:17.917 --> 26:20.082
Which means we need extra blood on hand

26:20.083 --> 26:22.164
in case there's excess
bleeding during the procedure.

26:22.267 --> 26:22.702
Correct.

26:22.703 --> 26:23.876
Oh, take mine.

26:23.877 --> 26:25.522
I mean, I-I don't know if
I'm the same blood type,

26:25.523 --> 26:26.718
- but I really...
- Honey, you don't have to.

26:26.719 --> 26:28.202
No, no, I want to. I want to
feel like I'm doing something

26:28.203 --> 26:30.287
to help you, okay? It's
okay, right, Topher?

26:30.288 --> 26:32.146
Speeds up the process.
Let's get her set up.

26:32.147 --> 26:33.747
Okay. Okay, great.

26:34.046 --> 26:35.752
Love you. Okay.

26:37.077 --> 26:38.305
Suction.

26:39.791 --> 26:40.844
Okay.

26:40.845 --> 26:42.718
Man, if you guys hadn't been there,

26:42.719 --> 26:44.369
he'd be out there dying in the desert.

26:44.370 --> 26:46.076
I know. We leave five minutes later,

26:46.076 --> 26:47.964
five minutes sooner, hit traffic,

26:47.965 --> 26:49.827
stop for dinner, I mean,
we never would've seen him.

26:49.828 --> 26:51.274
Okay, I found the bleeder.

26:51.274 --> 26:52.244
Apply pressure with the sponge-stick

26:52.245 --> 26:53.360
and hand me a satinsky clamp.

26:53.361 --> 26:55.092
All right, you clamp, I'll suture. Great.

26:55.634 --> 26:57.957
Whoa! Somebody call for a MedEvac?

26:57.958 --> 26:59.846
You are a sight for sore eyes.

26:59.847 --> 27:00.592
O.R. standing by.

27:00.593 --> 27:01.913
We should be there in 20 minutes.

27:02.316 --> 27:03.628
Good. Let's get him out of here.

27:03.629 --> 27:05.044
Done. That's great.

27:06.569 --> 27:08.311
Carl, you did great. Thank you.

27:08.312 --> 27:09.312
Yeah, thank you.

27:10.598 --> 27:12.554
S-so, you guys have boyfriends, or...

27:14.066 --> 27:15.508
Yeah, we do.

27:18.355 --> 27:19.597
Unfortunately,

27:19.598 --> 27:21.873
even though the tumor
removal was successful,

27:21.874 --> 27:23.504
the underlying tissue was damaged.

27:23.505 --> 27:25.671
So, what are you saying...
Nothing's changed?

27:25.672 --> 27:26.772
Because of the damage,

27:26.773 --> 27:27.960
she will continue to gain weight,

27:27.961 --> 27:29.721
which will lead to more
severe complications.

27:29.964 --> 27:31.457
How much more severe?

27:31.776 --> 27:32.872
Um...

27:32.873 --> 27:35.014
Well, she won't be able
to control her eating,

27:35.015 --> 27:36.810
and if left untreated, she will...

27:37.689 --> 27:39.157
Basically eat herself to death.

27:39.158 --> 27:40.533
Oh, my god, what do we do?

27:40.534 --> 27:42.424
She needs gastric bypass surgery.

27:42.425 --> 27:44.156
It's a lap-band which
constricts the stomach.

27:44.157 --> 27:47.002
It limits food intake and
makes the patient feel full.

27:47.003 --> 27:49.093
- Let's do it.
- The only problem is that

27:49.094 --> 27:50.672
there is a two-month waiting list here.

27:50.673 --> 27:53.024
Two months? You just said
she's eating herself to death.

27:53.025 --> 27:54.025
I know.

27:54.133 --> 27:55.522
Well, can't you do it?

27:55.954 --> 27:57.827
It's a surgical procedure
I'm not trained in.

27:57.828 --> 28:00.330
So I just have to watch her die?

28:01.343 --> 28:03.183
Let's go! Heading to the O.R.!

28:03.184 --> 28:04.628
Jordan, rough night?

28:04.629 --> 28:05.818
Yeah, I've had better.

28:05.819 --> 28:08.925
You should've seen your girl
in action... total badass.

28:08.926 --> 28:09.885
Not so bad yourself.

28:09.886 --> 28:11.480
Hey, look, I got to get to the O.R.,

28:11.481 --> 28:13.232
and don't think I didn't see
your bike sitting out there.

28:13.233 --> 28:14.253
I-I told you I was gonna buy it.

28:14.253 --> 28:15.589
No, you said we'd discuss it.

28:15.590 --> 28:17.263
We can discuss it, but I already bought it.

28:17.264 --> 28:18.893
Okay, we will talk about this.

28:20.252 --> 28:22.215
Dr. Kaminsky.

28:22.216 --> 28:23.723
Yeah, uh, I spoke to your assistant

28:23.724 --> 28:25.597
who said your schedule
for lap-band surgery

28:25.598 --> 28:27.356
is all booked up for the next two months.

28:27.357 --> 28:28.951
- Life is good.
- Yeah, yeah.

28:28.952 --> 28:32.010
See, I got a patient who
requires surgery right away.

28:32.011 --> 28:34.212
Uh, she's got morbid
obesity causing heart strain.

28:34.213 --> 28:35.266
Could lead to failure.

28:35.267 --> 28:37.032
Be a big favor if you could bump her up.

28:37.033 --> 28:38.249
Yeah, stop right there, Callahan.

28:38.250 --> 28:40.326
I'm not a fan of your cowboy antics.

28:40.704 --> 28:42.950
And my surgery department
doesn't work that way.

28:43.500 --> 28:45.674
Get in line like everybody else.

28:47.917 --> 28:49.370
I take it that's a no-go

28:49.371 --> 28:51.204
for getting Kaylee
cutsies in the lap-band?

28:51.205 --> 28:52.205
I'll figure it out.

28:52.629 --> 28:54.303
Yeah, I put calls in to some clinics,

28:54.304 --> 28:55.511
but it may take a few days.

28:55.512 --> 28:57.642
You know, it's too bad you can't bribe him

28:57.643 --> 29:00.181
or blackmail him 'cause I
hear he's a bit of a dick.

29:00.801 --> 29:01.941
Yeah.

29:02.582 --> 29:05.717
Toph. You have to see this.

29:06.169 --> 29:08.312
It's Brent's blood results.

29:15.689 --> 29:16.559
Hey.

29:16.560 --> 29:18.041
Hey.

29:18.042 --> 29:19.167
Brent's still in surgery?

29:19.168 --> 29:20.569
We just moved him to recovery,

29:20.570 --> 29:22.238
so you can go see him when he wakes up.

29:23.051 --> 29:24.297
Good.

29:24.623 --> 29:25.632
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

29:25.633 --> 29:26.342
Thank you so much.

29:26.343 --> 29:29.800
Hey, Simone, there's something
else we need to talk about.

29:29.801 --> 29:32.605
We know the meningitis is fungal,

29:32.606 --> 29:35.095
and fungal meningitis happens to patients

29:35.096 --> 29:37.657
with suppressed immune systems.

29:38.590 --> 29:41.518
I'm sorry. There's no easy
way to say this, but...

29:41.519 --> 29:43.378
Brent has H.I.V.

29:43.379 --> 29:43.893
Uh, what?

29:43.894 --> 29:47.919
And, uh, your blood was
screened when you donated.

29:48.605 --> 29:51.084
Simone... You have it, too.

29:59.188 --> 30:01.707
This is an unexpected bombshell, I know,

30:01.708 --> 30:03.190
but it's important to understand

30:03.191 --> 30:05.341
H.I.V. is no longer a death sentence.

30:05.342 --> 30:06.976
I don't... I don't understand.

30:07.819 --> 30:10.272
I mean, if we both have
it, w-why am I not sick?

30:10.273 --> 30:11.505
Y-you may never be.

30:11.970 --> 30:13.689
Look at Magic Johnson.

30:13.690 --> 30:16.061
I mean, it's really just a...

30:16.062 --> 30:17.417
a sad luck of the draw.

30:17.418 --> 30:19.103
Is it possible that he got it

30:19.104 --> 30:22.094
from the bio-shrapnel from the bone?

30:22.095 --> 30:24.580
Right, we checked with
military autopsy records,

30:24.581 --> 30:26.482
and Brent's buddy was H.I.V. negative,

30:26.483 --> 30:28.303
so he didn't get it from Troy.

30:28.693 --> 30:30.058
Okay. It's none of my business,

30:30.059 --> 30:32.968
and he could've contracted
it any number of ways.

30:32.969 --> 30:35.848
But I know what it's like
to be overseas, and...

30:36.550 --> 30:37.248
It's tough.

30:37.249 --> 30:39.214
- Brent didn't cheat.
- He's a good man.

30:39.802 --> 30:42.083
I know. I-I'm just saying

30:42.084 --> 30:44.829
that being so far from home

30:44.829 --> 30:46.872
for so long and under pressure...

30:46.873 --> 30:48.125
Brent didn't cheat.

30:49.746 --> 30:50.900
I did.

30:52.383 --> 30:53.875
- You did?
- Yeah, I did.

30:54.594 --> 30:56.048
I know, I know.

30:56.702 --> 30:58.429
I'm a horrible person.

30:59.075 --> 31:01.571
No, I'm... I'm not here to judge you.

31:01.572 --> 31:02.690
I'm... I'm here to help you.

31:02.691 --> 31:05.670
He's just... he's gone
for months at a time.

31:05.671 --> 31:08.095
I never know when he's
leaving, where he's going,

31:08.096 --> 31:09.593
or when he's coming back.

31:09.594 --> 31:12.765
We had to lie to our
family, to our friends...

31:13.535 --> 31:16.062
To you and Janet. It's just...

31:17.260 --> 31:19.785
It's just so much pressure...

31:20.576 --> 31:22.457
That he can never talk
about what he's done.

31:22.458 --> 31:24.264
I'm sorry. I know it's difficult,

31:24.265 --> 31:26.295
and this is a delicate thing,

31:26.296 --> 31:29.979
but you will have to tell
everyone you've been with.

31:30.275 --> 31:31.275
It was one guy.

31:31.610 --> 31:32.230
O-okay.

31:32.231 --> 31:33.796
It was one guy. It was one time.

31:33.797 --> 31:35.069
I-I swear.

31:36.612 --> 31:39.489
Uh, just a couple of
months ago, New Year's Eve.

31:39.490 --> 31:40.490
- I just...
- You don't...

31:40.840 --> 31:42.439
I got lonely. I...

31:42.440 --> 31:43.889
It's okay.

31:43.890 --> 31:46.869
What did I do? Oh, my God, what did I do?

31:51.109 --> 31:51.942
What's happening?

31:51.943 --> 31:53.292
She's been vomiting for five minutes.

31:53.292 --> 31:55.226
- I'm thinking gastroparesis.
- What is that?

31:55.227 --> 31:56.602
It means she can't hold anything down.

31:56.603 --> 31:58.496
Kenny, give her Metoclopramide
and Erythromycin.

31:58.497 --> 31:59.168
Yeah, on it.

31:59.169 --> 32:00.889
And they still won't
move her up after this?

32:01.705 --> 32:03.815
Please. You've got to do something.

32:03.816 --> 32:06.085
I'll figure it out. I promise.

32:07.494 --> 32:08.605
Oh, sweetie.

32:11.935 --> 32:14.690
Yes, well, he
totally dodged a bullet,

32:14.691 --> 32:16.431
but he's resting comfortably now.

32:17.010 --> 32:18.010
Yeah.

32:18.391 --> 32:20.981
Uh, of course, we will
absolutely let him know.

32:20.982 --> 32:24.049
Yeah. Okay, all right.

32:24.050 --> 32:25.202
Sure.

32:26.352 --> 32:28.115
Oh, man.

32:28.775 --> 32:30.804
Those phone calls are always fun to make.

32:30.805 --> 32:32.309
Yeah.

32:35.848 --> 32:37.322
- Jocelyn?
- Hey, what's up?

32:37.323 --> 32:38.306
Can I talk to you for a second?

32:38.307 --> 32:39.353
Sure, sure. What's up?

32:39.354 --> 32:41.349
I know you're pretty plugged
into the gossip around here.

32:41.350 --> 32:43.349
- Yeah, it's a fun hobby.
- Yeah, I bet.

32:43.350 --> 32:45.177
What do you know about Dr. Kaminsky?

32:45.177 --> 32:46.201
The lap-band surgeon.

32:46.202 --> 32:47.941
He's being a real dick to my patient,

32:47.942 --> 32:49.418
and anything you could give me?

32:49.419 --> 32:51.040
- Come on, come on.
- Yeah.

32:51.041 --> 32:52.107
Yeah?

32:58.738 --> 33:01.904
Those two have a long road ahead of them.

33:01.905 --> 33:03.984
Nice couple.

33:04.307 --> 33:05.123
Just goes to show,

33:05.124 --> 33:07.590
you never know what's going
on in other people's lives.

33:07.976 --> 33:09.084
Yeah.

33:09.085 --> 33:11.057
Hope they can work through it.

33:11.058 --> 33:12.426
Yeah.

33:14.025 --> 33:15.720
I don't know if I could.

33:15.721 --> 33:18.167
It's not your typical cheating situation.

33:18.168 --> 33:20.240
It's hard for the wives, girlfriends,

33:20.241 --> 33:22.708
and partners who stay home.

33:22.709 --> 33:24.596
They pay a price, too.

33:25.014 --> 33:28.052
Sometimes we forget that. I know I did.

33:28.363 --> 33:31.156
Really? You cheat?

33:31.449 --> 33:36.308
No. No! I... I was lucky to find Janet.

33:36.606 --> 33:38.581
I mean, I'm not blowing that.

33:38.582 --> 33:39.700
I'm just saying, you know,

33:39.701 --> 33:44.312
sometimes not appreciating
your wife the way you should.

33:44.692 --> 33:47.177
You know, we're a team.

33:50.997 --> 33:52.811
Ah. Callahan.

33:52.812 --> 33:55.083
I already told you...
And so did my assistant...

33:55.084 --> 33:56.814
It's a two-month waiting list.

33:57.134 --> 33:58.955
Right. Your assistant.

33:59.404 --> 34:00.174
She's cute.

34:00.175 --> 34:02.252
I hear you pay her to do little dances

34:02.253 --> 34:03.614
for you after hours.

34:04.077 --> 34:06.927
Rumor has it the nurses
call you "Dr. Lap Dance."

34:06.928 --> 34:08.667
- What?
- You don't have to convince me,

34:08.668 --> 34:10.553
but it's your wife I'm worried about.

34:10.554 --> 34:12.701
How much does divorce cost these days?

34:12.702 --> 34:14.844
You son of a bitch.

34:14.846 --> 34:16.199
You wouldn't have the balls.

34:16.199 --> 34:17.829
Oh, I... I would.

34:17.830 --> 34:19.710
See, my patient needs surgery today,

34:19.710 --> 34:20.505
not in two months,

34:20.505 --> 34:22.786
so if you take care of her,
I'll forget everything I know.

34:23.121 --> 34:24.335
If not...

34:24.676 --> 34:26.426
Gonna have to call your wife right now.

34:28.737 --> 34:31.030
Get her prepped. I'll get to her when
I can.

34:31.031 --> 34:32.237
Actually, she's already prepped

34:32.237 --> 34:33.905
'cause I figured you would say yes.

34:34.286 --> 34:35.692
Jocelyn, Paul.

34:41.266 --> 34:42.896
You kept your promise.

34:43.483 --> 34:47.610
Damn right, and I will be
there for your next play, okay?

34:48.936 --> 34:50.561
You better keep your mouth shut, Callahan.

34:50.562 --> 34:52.384
Oh, hey, professional courtesy.

34:53.190 --> 34:54.092
Thanks, Jocelyn.

34:54.094 --> 34:55.690
Anytime. He's a pig.

35:02.796 --> 35:03.772
Hey, so, I was thinking...

35:03.773 --> 35:04.864
That could be dangerous.

35:04.865 --> 35:06.802
Oh, this is dangerous.
This is very dangerous.

35:06.803 --> 35:08.570
Uh, my sister's coming into town next week,

35:08.571 --> 35:10.368
and I was thinking about
maybe introducing you.

35:10.368 --> 35:12.121
Oh, the sister test.
What happens if I fail?

35:12.122 --> 35:14.002
Does that mean you have
to get a new girlfriend?

35:16.152 --> 35:17.873
Oh, so you're officially my girlfriend now?

35:18.211 --> 35:19.516
It's a figure of speech.

35:19.517 --> 35:21.462
I meant friend who happens to be a girl.

35:21.463 --> 35:22.458
- Okay.
- God!

35:22.459 --> 35:24.190
No, no, that's how I'll introduce you.

35:24.191 --> 35:26.755
"This is Gwen, my friend
who happens to be a girl."

35:27.288 --> 35:28.833
Oh, yeah?

35:28.834 --> 35:29.828
Mm-hmm.

35:29.829 --> 35:31.511
Thank you so much!

35:31.512 --> 35:33.127
You're welcome. She's a great kid.

35:33.128 --> 35:34.186
She deserves a better life.

35:34.187 --> 35:35.305
Hopefully, now she'll have it.

35:35.306 --> 35:36.545
- I'll check on her later.
- Okay.

35:36.545 --> 35:38.212
She'll be in recovery soon.

35:53.427 --> 35:54.698
- Hey.
- Hey.

35:55.126 --> 35:56.147
Thanks for coming.

35:56.148 --> 35:57.269
Thanks for asking.

35:57.270 --> 35:58.648
You sure you want to do this?

35:58.649 --> 35:59.927
Yeah, I'm sure.

36:05.016 --> 36:06.487
- Hello.
- Hi.

36:06.488 --> 36:07.575
Captain Drew Alister.

36:07.576 --> 36:09.294
Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you.

36:09.295 --> 36:11.697
I appreciate you doing
this. Please, have a seat.

36:16.749 --> 36:17.975
Okay, you all set? You ready?

36:19.039 --> 36:20.556
Yeah.

36:20.557 --> 36:23.242
And 3, 2...

36:23.786 --> 36:25.509
I'm here with Dr. Drew Alister,

36:25.510 --> 36:27.398
the hero who risked his own life

36:27.399 --> 36:30.499
to stop the shooting from
happening just a few days ago.

36:30.500 --> 36:31.880
Can you tell us about it, Doctor?

36:32.469 --> 36:34.472
I just did what any other soldier would do.

36:34.473 --> 36:35.917
It just happened to be me,

36:36.309 --> 36:38.807
but I firmly believe that the
men and women I served with

36:38.808 --> 36:40.388
would've done the same thing.

36:41.238 --> 36:42.835
My partner, Rick...

36:42.836 --> 36:45.740
Would've done the same thing, as well.

36:45.741 --> 36:47.483
I was just trying to do what was right.

36:47.484 --> 36:50.148
And this man sitting
next to you, your partner,

36:50.149 --> 36:51.963
army captain Rick Lincoln.

36:52.393 --> 36:54.204
Please tell me what went through your head

36:54.205 --> 36:55.615
when you heard the news?

36:55.616 --> 36:58.206
Uh, well, honestly, the first thought was,

36:58.207 --> 36:59.255
"that stupid idiot."

37:00.350 --> 37:01.537
But, um...

37:01.538 --> 37:03.653
You know, of course,
he behaved exactly like

37:03.654 --> 37:05.349
I knew he would.

37:06.260 --> 37:08.136
Train for these things, and he was...

37:08.904 --> 37:12.090
So, what are your
big plans today, Doctor?

37:12.091 --> 37:13.725
Well, I got my mom to watch the kids,

37:13.726 --> 37:15.803
so Janet and I are headed out for a picnic.

37:16.172 --> 37:18.592
Figure it's time to tell
her about my trip to Dubai.

37:18.593 --> 37:20.669
That's my boy. Just rip the band-aid off.

37:20.670 --> 37:22.375
No, no, you got to remove it gently.

37:22.376 --> 37:24.243
That way, you don't cause more pain.

37:24.718 --> 37:26.996
Anyway, it looks like
your band-aid's still on.

37:26.997 --> 37:29.633
- She is not happy.
- I got to say...

37:30.286 --> 37:32.135
- I'm on her side.
- Aw, get out.

37:48.089 --> 37:49.435
Hey.

37:52.220 --> 37:54.126
So, my motorcycle guy pulled through.

37:54.126 --> 37:55.708
Yeah. Thanks to you.

37:55.709 --> 37:58.540
I'm more worried about this motorcycle guy.

37:59.705 --> 38:03.115
I am not trying to change you.

38:03.116 --> 38:06.019
I just don't want anything
bad to happen to you.

38:06.020 --> 38:07.328
Nothing is gonna happen to me.

38:07.329 --> 38:09.124
You don't know that.

38:09.648 --> 38:12.461
Okay, people say those
kind of things, and then...

38:12.982 --> 38:14.946
You can't control the other guy.

38:14.947 --> 38:16.033
I love this bike.

38:16.596 --> 38:19.096
I love how this bike makes
me feel when I ride it.

38:19.097 --> 38:20.965
I-I love working on this bike.

38:21.958 --> 38:25.437
But I love you, too, and,
uh, how about a compromise?

38:26.189 --> 38:27.389
I'll only ride it on the weekends.

38:27.390 --> 38:28.972
Babe, this is not about the bike.

38:29.465 --> 38:30.302
I thought this was about the bike.

38:30.303 --> 38:32.820
No, this is about
responsibility, okay?!

38:32.821 --> 38:36.408
I have a child, our child,
growing inside of me,

38:36.409 --> 38:38.146
and it is changing me!

38:38.147 --> 38:39.907
I am changing!

38:39.908 --> 38:42.494
And I thought it was
just gonna be physical,

38:42.495 --> 38:45.912
but finding out that it is
way, way bigger than that.

38:45.913 --> 38:46.764
Yeah, I can see that.

38:46.765 --> 38:48.211
I have all these hormones,

38:48.212 --> 38:50.208
and they're just raging and
flying all over the place.

38:50.209 --> 38:51.943
I don't know. I was...
I was out there today,

38:51.944 --> 38:54.183
and I just... I felt like this mama lion.

38:54.524 --> 38:55.340
Mama lion?

38:55.341 --> 38:57.034
Don't you dare make fun of me!

38:57.035 --> 38:59.501
- Sorry.
- I saw this kid,

38:59.502 --> 39:03.218
and I saw his boyish face,
and I thought about his mother,

39:03.219 --> 39:04.575
and then I thought about the fact

39:04.576 --> 39:08.472
that I am going to be a mother,
and it all just kicked in.

39:09.951 --> 39:11.767
And I hate this bike!

39:12.409 --> 39:14.167
And I don't want you to get rid of it

39:14.168 --> 39:15.406
if you don't want to get rid of it,

39:15.407 --> 39:17.228
but I want you to want to get rid of it

39:17.229 --> 39:18.992
and not because I asked
you to get rid of it.

39:19.859 --> 39:21.332
- So you want me to give up the bike?
- No.

39:21.333 --> 39:22.465
Are you even listening to me?

39:22.466 --> 39:24.759
Yeah, no, I-it's a good idea.

39:25.354 --> 39:29.608
Just go home.

39:30.118 --> 39:31.184
Okay.

39:31.185 --> 39:33.692
I left my
car at the animal hospital.

39:33.693 --> 39:36.755
Okay. We can just take my bike.

39:36.756 --> 39:38.188
- You're not funny.
- No, I...

39:39.430 --> 39:40.560
I called a cab.

39:41.042 --> 39:41.774
You did?

39:41.775 --> 39:42.674
Yeah.

39:42.674 --> 39:44.508
Really?

39:44.509 --> 39:45.932
- You did?
- Yeah.

39:45.933 --> 39:47.107
Thank you.

39:48.212 --> 39:49.298
Thank you so much.
