WEBVTT

00:41.208 --> 00:46.964
II'

00:54.596 --> 00:57.891
<i>Order, order!</i>

00:58.058 --> 01:02.938
In the matter of Lajos Kossuth
of Hungary.

01:03.105 --> 01:06.733
Who is this tormentor
of the Austrian monarchy?

01:06.900 --> 01:11.530
This exile now seeking asylum
in Britain?

01:11.697 --> 01:13.907
Mr. Speaker,
Kossuth is seen here

01:14.074 --> 01:16.868
as a hero of the common people,

01:17.035 --> 01:19.246
a cat set amongst
the fluttering pigeons

01:19.413 --> 01:21.999
of the royal families of Europe.

01:24.209 --> 01:26.545
Order.

01:26.712 --> 01:31.466
II'

01:39.558 --> 01:41.602
II'

01:44.021 --> 01:45.314
Herr Kossuth,

01:45.480 --> 01:47.274
I am the foreign secretary
of Great Britain,

01:47.441 --> 01:48.710
and you are most welcome,
friend.

01:48.734 --> 01:50.611
<i>Alas, these pigeons,</i>

01:50.777 --> 01:53.405
<i>they fear the conversation.</i>

01:53.572 --> 01:55.449
They are all a-commotion.

01:56.617 --> 01:57.617
Some of them

01:57.743 --> 01:59.411
have even fled their nests.

01:59.578 --> 02:03.707
II'

02:03.874 --> 02:06.126
We seem to be managing all right
without them.

02:12.633 --> 02:14.051
And... engage!

02:15.927 --> 02:18.096
Hi-yah!

02:19.931 --> 02:21.516
No mercy, princess.

02:27.230 --> 02:28.390
Know it's the Peninsular War,

02:28.523 --> 02:30.609
but... I'm unclear which battle.

02:30.776 --> 02:34.613
Fuentes de Onoro.

02:34.780 --> 02:36.740
Bertie is the duke
of Wellington.

02:36.907 --> 02:38.742
Naturally.

02:38.909 --> 02:40.345
As well as the
physical exercise, you see,

02:40.369 --> 02:42.079
there is also
a dramatic representation

02:42.245 --> 02:44.122
of military conquest.

02:44.289 --> 02:45.957
So his historical knowledge
is expanded.

02:46.124 --> 02:47.417
The English will never take us.

02:47.584 --> 02:49.127
<i>Vive Napoléon!</i>

02:50.462 --> 02:52.881
I wish there were a part for me.

02:53.048 --> 02:55.258
Do a party joust. BERTIE: Oh!

02:55.425 --> 02:56.425
Oh!

02:58.011 --> 02:59.304
Well played, sir.

03:05.852 --> 03:08.021
Your Majesty.

03:08.188 --> 03:10.023
Well fought, sir. Well played.

03:15.737 --> 03:18.865
Kossuth was received
"rapturously."

03:20.200 --> 03:21.910
Palmerston addressed him
as "friend."

03:22.077 --> 03:24.955
Palmerston is a blackguard,
and he must be disciplined.

03:25.122 --> 03:27.541
A simpler task were I not
100 miles from Parliament.

03:27.708 --> 03:30.108
We should demonstrate solidarity
with our royal counterparts,

03:30.252 --> 03:31.420
not offer sanctuary

03:31.586 --> 03:34.047
to those who seek
to annihilate us.

03:34.214 --> 03:35.632
Perhaps I shall write
to the emperor

03:35.799 --> 03:38.135
and explain the decision
to admit him was not yours.

03:38.301 --> 03:40.095
It wasn't.

03:40.262 --> 03:41.972
Because I wasn't there.

03:44.766 --> 03:46.184
Yes, of course, write a letter.

03:46.351 --> 03:47.951
How else can we participate
in government

03:48.103 --> 03:49.646
except by writing letters?

03:49.813 --> 03:51.106
- I didn't cheat.
- You did.

03:51.273 --> 03:52.816
Take that! Ow!

03:52.983 --> 03:55.360
Bertie! VICKY: That hurt.

03:55.527 --> 03:57.154
Be gracious in victory.

04:06.079 --> 04:09.207
God's bloody trousers.

04:09.374 --> 04:10.959
I did not enter royal service

04:11.126 --> 04:14.838
to go traipsing around
a garden clattering a drum.

04:15.005 --> 04:17.799
Give it up, then.

04:17.966 --> 04:19.217
Like this.

04:25.515 --> 04:27.768
I fear the queen
will be very wounded

04:27.934 --> 04:29.352
by Lord Palmerston's remarks.

04:29.519 --> 04:32.439
The man is a scoundrel.

04:32.606 --> 04:34.065
Incorrigible.

04:36.193 --> 04:39.029
I wonder how long
we shall remain here.

04:39.196 --> 04:42.574
Your Serene Highness must long
for the comforts of home.

04:42.741 --> 04:47.204
My only home, for now,
is with my sister;

04:47.370 --> 04:49.372
And if she chooses to live
on an island,

04:49.539 --> 04:51.208
so be it.

04:53.251 --> 04:57.380
Though I do wish my bedroom
had a view of the sea.

04:57.547 --> 04:58.566
My room looks onto the sea.

04:58.590 --> 04:59.590
Shall we exchange?

04:59.633 --> 05:00.967
How kind you are.

05:01.134 --> 05:02.344
But surely,

05:02.511 --> 05:05.388
you shall be returning home
soon?

05:05.555 --> 05:08.558
Your husband must be pining
for you.

05:08.725 --> 05:12.145
Do you know
what that man has done?

05:12.312 --> 05:15.524
He's sent our son away
to boarding school.

05:15.690 --> 05:16.817
The child is six.

05:19.319 --> 05:23.782
It is better that I am here.

05:23.949 --> 05:26.535
Bertie answers to nothing,
nothing!

05:26.701 --> 05:28.036
How am I supposed to teach a boy

05:28.203 --> 05:29.329
that...

05:29.496 --> 05:31.832
Oh, but your concern is
the report

05:31.998 --> 05:33.750
of your spy in London»
he speaks of what?

05:33.917 --> 05:35.517
Uh, crowds cheering Palmerston,
no doubt.

05:35.585 --> 05:36.962
Albert, this is not from London.

05:37.128 --> 05:38.964
It's from Francatelli.

05:39.130 --> 05:40.841
The cook.

05:41.007 --> 05:42.050
He's resigned.

05:42.217 --> 05:43.260
Then he shall be replaced.

05:43.426 --> 05:44.511
Victoria, really,

05:44.678 --> 05:46.318
this is such
a, a trivial domestic matter.

05:46.471 --> 05:48.807
Drina, if you will permit,

05:48.974 --> 05:50.308
when we return to London...

05:50.475 --> 05:52.155
Did you know anything
about this, Skerrett?

05:53.311 --> 05:54.813
No, ma'am.

05:57.274 --> 05:58.942
Please, um...

05:59.109 --> 06:00.402
Would you mind?

06:05.699 --> 06:07.284
Unleashing your
vitriol on Skerrett

06:07.450 --> 06:08.719
is not going to make
the situation better.

06:08.743 --> 06:10.161
Vitriol?

06:13.874 --> 06:16.877
II'

06:18.670 --> 06:20.297
I didn't believe
you really would.

06:20.463 --> 06:22.841
Well, Mrs. Francatelli,

06:23.008 --> 06:24.593
ldid.

06:24.759 --> 06:26.595
And did the world end?

06:26.761 --> 06:28.346
More or less.

06:28.513 --> 06:30.473
They've been at
each other's throats for weeks.

06:32.601 --> 06:33.828
Problem is,
she's queen of England,

06:33.852 --> 06:36.479
but he's king
of the Isle of Wight.

06:40.275 --> 06:42.986
Your turn, my honey.

06:44.654 --> 06:48.283
Do it.

06:48.450 --> 06:49.951
You don't have to say it
to her face.

06:50.118 --> 06:50.952
You can write it, like I did.

06:51.119 --> 06:52.245
No.

06:53.997 --> 06:57.500
No, I... I have to say it.

07:00.045 --> 07:01.397
The natural ebb and flow
of the staff, Victoria,

07:01.421 --> 07:02.773
is something you must not
allow yourself

07:02.797 --> 07:03.858
to be distracted by... Must?

07:03.882 --> 07:04.942
Must? ...While we are here.

07:04.966 --> 07:06.593
It is not what matters.

07:06.760 --> 07:08.845
Here, what matters is
the children.

07:09.012 --> 07:11.181
Here, they can be occupied.

07:11.348 --> 07:13.266
It is what corrupts
the aristocracy,

07:13.433 --> 07:15.268
to have no occupation.

07:15.435 --> 07:17.187
Bertie, for example;

07:17.354 --> 07:18.873
I want Bertie to be able
to make things,

07:18.897 --> 07:20.374
to, to repair them
when they are broken,

07:20.398 --> 07:21.566
to, to grow the wheat,

07:21.733 --> 07:23.902
make the flour, bake the bread.

07:24.069 --> 07:27.781
But most of all,
I want him to... read.

07:29.199 --> 07:30.784
He does not read.

07:30.951 --> 07:34.162
If our children are going
to be of value,

07:34.329 --> 07:35.914
it is their duty to be the best.

07:36.081 --> 07:38.333
<i>Our duty to make them so.</i>

07:38.500 --> 07:41.086
I designed this house
to be a place

07:41.252 --> 07:43.004
where our children
can become superb.

07:43.171 --> 07:45.590
Palmerston has invited Kossuth

07:45.757 --> 07:47.676
to dine with him
in his London club.

07:47.842 --> 07:49.820
Albert, that is an
insubordination I cannot ignore.

07:49.844 --> 07:52.681
He's lied through his teeth
about the Chartists.

07:52.847 --> 07:54.474
And then he... swaggers about,

07:54.641 --> 07:56.309
openly calling me a coward.

07:56.476 --> 07:57.852
Albert, I must return

07:58.019 --> 07:59.396
to London. No.

08:01.606 --> 08:03.358
No, Victoria.

08:05.110 --> 08:06.820
Well, then, London must come
to me.

08:08.571 --> 08:13.660
II'

08:24.504 --> 08:26.339
Without your train, Henry,

08:26.506 --> 08:28.341
if that's possible.

08:31.136 --> 08:32.554
Gentlemen,

08:32.721 --> 08:36.307
the prime minister and I
have some private business.

08:36.474 --> 08:38.977
Thank you.

08:47.360 --> 08:48.903
We haven't time.

08:49.070 --> 08:50.155
It is not a suggestion.

08:50.321 --> 08:52.699
It's a royal command.

08:52.866 --> 08:54.451
Oh, well.

08:54.617 --> 08:57.120
We couldn't possible refuse
one of those, could we?

09:00.498 --> 09:04.294
II'

09:11.092 --> 09:14.888
Can we explore the cave, Papa?

09:15.055 --> 09:16.389
Lead on.

09:16.556 --> 09:18.641
Papa, look!

09:21.895 --> 09:23.730
Well, we must make the most

09:23.897 --> 09:26.733
of what the prince calls,
"the amenities."

09:26.900 --> 09:29.444
However unamenable
they might seem.

09:32.363 --> 09:34.741
You'll be all
right, Your Majesty.

09:34.908 --> 09:36.534
Do you suppose
it's possible, actually,

09:36.701 --> 09:39.537
to breathe under the water?

09:39.704 --> 09:42.415
I really don't know, ma'am.

09:42.582 --> 09:43.666
Fish do it.

09:43.833 --> 09:45.251
Hmm.

09:49.589 --> 09:52.425
Right.

09:57.639 --> 10:00.308
II'

10:25.875 --> 10:28.128
Your Majesty!

10:29.796 --> 10:30.964
Your Majesty.

10:39.222 --> 10:40.223
Drina.

10:46.229 --> 10:47.564
Well, lthink we have established

10:47.730 --> 10:48.940
the queen of England is...

10:49.107 --> 10:51.234
not a fish.

10:58.867 --> 11:02.996
We came at once, as
the situation is clearly urgent.

11:03.163 --> 11:06.708
How may we be of assistance
to Your Majesty?

11:17.427 --> 11:18.845
This room is very...

11:21.222 --> 11:22.432
<i>N001'!-</i>

11:22.599 --> 11:24.142
I designed it myself.

11:24.309 --> 11:25.852
Yes, I can see that.

11:26.019 --> 11:27.770
Lord John,

11:27.937 --> 11:29.689
concerning this Kossuth.

11:29.856 --> 11:30.982
It is paramount

11:31.149 --> 11:33.318
we do not antagonize
the Austrian monarchy.

11:33.484 --> 11:35.069
I am addressing
my prime minister.

11:35.236 --> 11:36.654
Kossuth's reception into Britain

11:36.821 --> 11:39.616
makes my country look
duplicitous and weak.

11:39.782 --> 11:41.159
With respect, ma'am...

11:41.326 --> 11:42.970
There is no respect
in what you have to say,

11:42.994 --> 11:44.078
Lord Palmerston.

11:44.245 --> 11:45.965
Saying "with respect"
does not put it there.

11:46.122 --> 11:49.167
These are matters
of foreign diplomacy, ma'am.

11:49.334 --> 11:50.752
I am your foreign secretary.

11:50.919 --> 11:52.420
And we shall come to that.

11:54.589 --> 11:57.133
Understand a member of
your cabinet has invited Kossuth

11:57.300 --> 11:58.760
to dine with him...
Is that correct?

11:58.927 --> 12:00.929
May... May I speak?

12:01.095 --> 12:02.222
If there is time

12:02.388 --> 12:03.973
in your busy schedule of dinners

12:04.140 --> 12:05.558
with regicidal anarchists.

12:05.725 --> 12:07.810
Lajos Kossuth is not a regicide,

12:07.977 --> 12:09.312
and he's not an anarchist.

12:09.479 --> 12:11.731
He's beheld his people
being taxed to death

12:11.898 --> 12:13.024
by a rapacious tyrant.

12:13.191 --> 12:14.609
As my minister of state,

12:14.776 --> 12:16.256
you will undertake to do
three things.

12:16.361 --> 12:17.713
One: You will retract
your invitation

12:17.737 --> 12:19.572
to dine with Kossuth.

12:19.739 --> 12:21.407
Two: You will see him cleanly

12:21.574 --> 12:22.992
off the premises of my country.

12:23.159 --> 12:25.012
Three: You will write to
the crowned heads of Europe,

12:25.036 --> 12:27.997
assuring them
of my government's allegiance.

12:28.164 --> 12:30.583
Is there anything on that list
you do not understand?

12:32.126 --> 12:35.004
Your Majesty is
pellucidly clear.

12:35.171 --> 12:38.299
Then why do you grin at me?

12:38.466 --> 12:41.803
I cannot help the disposition
of my face, ma'am.

12:43.638 --> 12:45.390
Or is that thing number four'?

12:49.936 --> 12:53.147
Please forgive
me for being so bold,

12:53.314 --> 12:54.565
but am I right

12:54.732 --> 12:58.278
in assuming you share
my opinion of Palmerston?

12:58.444 --> 13:01.030
That the man is
a preening buffoon?

13:01.197 --> 13:05.285
Palmerston is
morbidly incapable of not preening,

13:05.451 --> 13:06.577
but he is no buffoon.

13:06.744 --> 13:08.997
I'd sooner he were lolling

13:09.163 --> 13:11.666
in my cabinet,
causing irritation

13:11.833 --> 13:13.334
than ranked
on the opposite bench,

13:13.501 --> 13:15.336
whipping up the mob against me.

13:15.503 --> 13:17.046
Hmm.

13:17.213 --> 13:19.882
I trust you shall stay
for a day or two?

13:20.049 --> 13:22.719
Isensed
the queen wished us gone.

13:22.885 --> 13:25.680
Oh, well, you have traveled
such a long way.

13:25.847 --> 13:28.433
It would be discourteous
not to invite you.

13:28.599 --> 13:30.310
Ah.

13:30.476 --> 13:31.602
Here.

13:34.147 --> 13:38.318
It's best to eat just the top.

13:40.445 --> 13:42.488
Oh, Russell, good heavens.

13:42.655 --> 13:45.867
You must cook them first.

13:47.327 --> 13:49.078
Ah, good day.

13:49.245 --> 13:50.538
Papa.

13:50.705 --> 13:51.998
My, my-

13:52.165 --> 13:54.500
<i>Good.</i>

13:54.667 --> 13:58.671
Russell, it is, um,
safe to eat this.

14:10.725 --> 14:12.101
Bertie.

14:14.062 --> 14:15.188
Bertie!

14:24.113 --> 14:25.281
I'd, um...

14:25.448 --> 14:27.700
I'd like to exchange rooms
with Princess Feodora.

14:27.867 --> 14:30.078
She wishes
for a view of the sea.

14:30.244 --> 14:31.412
Will you arrange it?

14:31.579 --> 14:33.498
Of course, Your Grace.

14:33.664 --> 14:36.125
Though, uh...

14:36.292 --> 14:38.878
The sea's a fine thing
to look upon.

14:41.255 --> 14:42.524
It makes no difference
what I look upon

14:42.548 --> 14:44.467
if it isn't my little boy.

14:46.135 --> 14:48.679
I'm so sorry you have to be
parted from him.

14:48.846 --> 14:50.807
It must, uh...

14:50.973 --> 14:52.058
Forgive me, I...

14:57.146 --> 14:59.583
Prime minister and the foreign
secretary are here, Your Grace.

14:59.607 --> 15:02.318
Lord Palmerston has come?

15:04.862 --> 15:07.031
Joseph, isn't it?

15:18.876 --> 15:22.046
II'

15:25.550 --> 15:28.553
Naught, multiplied by two.

15:28.719 --> 15:29.804
Two.

15:29.971 --> 15:33.641
No, naught has no value.

15:33.808 --> 15:36.894
Try to imagine the, the two
and the naught on the page.

15:37.061 --> 15:38.146
20.

15:38.312 --> 15:40.064
Albert.

15:40.231 --> 15:41.983
Can it be true
you've invited...?

15:42.150 --> 15:47.113
This boy's refusal to learn
is preposterous.

15:47.280 --> 15:49.157
He can hear you, you know.

15:51.868 --> 15:54.120
All right.

15:54.287 --> 15:57.457
Let's leave arithmetic behind,

15:57.623 --> 16:01.294
turn our attention to French.

16:01.461 --> 16:02.753
I shall set a test.

16:02.920 --> 16:05.089
Thank you.

16:05.256 --> 16:06.632
This way.

16:37.580 --> 16:38.664
Forgive me, Your Grace,

16:38.831 --> 16:41.626
there is something come adrift.

16:44.003 --> 16:45.129
Uh...

17:09.862 --> 17:12.031
Where's your husband, Duchess?

17:15.576 --> 17:17.495
The man to whom you are married?

17:18.913 --> 17:20.164
He's in London.

17:20.331 --> 17:22.291
Excellent.

17:24.961 --> 17:27.713
It is shocking
that you find it excellent

17:27.880 --> 17:29.048
that my husband isn't here.

17:29.215 --> 17:30.299
Shocking.

17:31.717 --> 17:34.470
Excessively shocking.

17:34.637 --> 17:37.598
But also excellent.

17:44.689 --> 17:49.569
II'

17:57.952 --> 17:59.412
Henry.

17:59.579 --> 18:01.497
How is Lady Palmerston?

18:01.664 --> 18:03.207
As ever.

18:03.374 --> 18:05.876
In charge, full of plans.

18:06.043 --> 18:08.129
It's kind of you to ask.

18:22.143 --> 18:24.312
Lord Palmerston. Ma'am.

18:24.478 --> 18:25.980
Will you make up our table?

18:26.147 --> 18:27.273
Ma'am.

18:32.570 --> 18:35.031
Now that I have you
within range, sir,

18:35.197 --> 18:37.074
I want to know:
Why did you suppose

18:37.241 --> 18:39.160
that I would not be offended

18:39.327 --> 18:44.498
to hear myself dismissed...
as a pigeon?

18:44.665 --> 18:47.293
I did not suppose it, ma'am.

18:47.460 --> 18:49.086
In truth, I...

18:49.253 --> 18:50.796
didn't expect you to hear
my analogy

18:50.963 --> 18:52.548
from... such a distance.

18:52.715 --> 18:53.942
Whenever statesmen plead
"in truth,"

18:53.966 --> 18:56.969
I cannot help
but doubt their word.

18:57.136 --> 18:59.513
I can assure you
I wasn't pleading.

18:59.680 --> 19:01.766
I merely sought to engage
the attention of the House.

19:01.932 --> 19:03.601
You were playing to the gallery.

19:03.768 --> 19:06.228
Something we all relish, ma'am.

19:09.482 --> 19:12.860
I read in the newspaper, ma'am.

19:13.027 --> 19:14.904
The German states
are now considered

19:15.071 --> 19:16.364
as safe.

19:16.530 --> 19:17.730
Thought it might be something;

19:17.865 --> 19:19.092
That would be
of particular interest

19:19.116 --> 19:20.910
to... Her Serene Highness.

19:21.077 --> 19:23.329
Oh, that's wonderful news.

19:23.496 --> 19:24.580
Albert. ALBERT: Hmm?

19:24.747 --> 19:26.624
We must make arrangements
accordingly.

19:26.791 --> 19:28.834
Drina,

19:29.001 --> 19:31.212
might 1 have your permission
to {withdraw?

19:33.506 --> 19:34.799
I don't understand.

19:34.965 --> 19:37.802
Surely you long to be reunited
with your family?

19:37.968 --> 19:39.553
In Langenburg,
there is still such...

19:39.720 --> 19:41.389
hatred.

19:41.555 --> 19:42.890
And I am, of course,

19:43.057 --> 19:45.309
a blood relative of a queen.

19:47.228 --> 19:49.146
Were I to return, my life,

19:49.313 --> 19:53.484
the lives of my children,

19:53.651 --> 19:55.027
they would be in...

19:55.194 --> 19:57.196
great danger.

19:57.363 --> 20:00.616
My own husband tells me so.

20:00.783 --> 20:03.035
Is this your understanding?

20:03.202 --> 20:05.621
I cannot say, ma'am.

20:05.788 --> 20:07.140
But I do have informants
in the city

20:07.164 --> 20:09.542
and I will interrogate them
closely.

20:09.709 --> 20:12.336
Anything to assist a princess.

20:12.503 --> 20:15.840
And until then,

20:16.006 --> 20:18.426
there is absolutely no question
of you going anywhere.

20:18.592 --> 20:21.554
You shall remain here,

20:21.721 --> 20:23.264
with us.

20:27.101 --> 20:33.774
II'

20:37.278 --> 20:40.281
This <i>carpet</i> is <i>very mouvementé.</i>

20:40.448 --> 20:45.745
Do you suppose the prince
designed it, as well?

20:45.911 --> 20:49.749
It was considerate of you
to offer to assist me.

20:49.915 --> 20:51.208
Thank you.

20:51.375 --> 20:54.462
"Considerate" is one word.

20:57.798 --> 21:01.886
My informers in Langenburg
reported back to me

21:02.052 --> 21:03.804
just the other day.

21:03.971 --> 21:06.557
They said, quite categorically,
that it's perfectly safe

21:06.724 --> 21:08.726
for you to return home
when you wish,

21:08.893 --> 21:10.895
as you well know.

21:11.061 --> 21:14.482
But I am the sister of...
Your Serene Highness,

21:14.648 --> 21:17.318
the dissenters have
no interest in you.

21:17.485 --> 21:21.322
You simply want to stay
in England.

21:21.489 --> 21:25.367
What sort of trick
do you play on me?

21:25.534 --> 21:28.120
What sort of trick
do you play on her?

21:43.511 --> 21:45.304
<i>I</i> know you do not care

21:45.471 --> 21:46.680
for my house.

21:46.847 --> 21:48.849
I love your house.

21:49.016 --> 21:50.810
I love you,

21:50.976 --> 21:53.771
and the children
you have blessed me with, but...

21:53.938 --> 21:56.106
The troubles of my
country do not simply vanish

21:56.273 --> 21:58.734
because I can no longer see them
from my window.

22:00.152 --> 22:01.362
What?

22:01.529 --> 22:02.696
I did not speak.

22:02.863 --> 22:05.282
Yet, as you intended, I heard.

22:05.449 --> 22:07.827
You radiate sullen disapproval.

22:07.993 --> 22:11.372
No, it's not disapproval,
Victoria.

22:11.539 --> 22:13.332
I'm afraid.

22:13.499 --> 22:15.101
You demonstrated your authority
to Palmerston,

22:15.125 --> 22:17.211
you told him what you wanted,
he acquiesced.

22:17.378 --> 22:19.481
Whether or not he will actually
carry out what you want

22:19.505 --> 22:21.674
when he returns to London...
That man's trouble is,

22:21.841 --> 22:23.092
he's in love,

22:23.259 --> 22:26.303
with the people being
in love with him.

22:26.470 --> 22:28.931
This is my fear:

22:29.098 --> 22:30.808
That it may also be true of you.

22:32.810 --> 22:35.563
That your heart craves

22:35.729 --> 22:37.815
adulation.

22:39.942 --> 22:41.360
"Craves adulation"?

22:41.527 --> 22:43.529
That's why you find it
so hard to be here.

22:43.696 --> 22:46.448
Deprived of it.

22:52.746 --> 22:55.457
It is your prerogative

22:55.624 --> 23:00.421
to favor me
with your analysis, Albert.

23:00.588 --> 23:02.172
Mine to disregard it.

23:04.592 --> 23:06.093
Now I wish to sleep.

23:12.016 --> 23:13.142
Good night.

23:43.839 --> 23:46.717
II'

24:03.400 --> 24:06.612
Your Serene
Highness, good evening.

24:06.779 --> 24:08.364
Trivial misunderstanding.

24:10.658 --> 24:14.119
Oh, I think it's very clear
what has happened here.

24:24.380 --> 24:29.718
II'

24:55.202 --> 25:00.290
II'

25:12.803 --> 25:13.637
Mr. Penge.

25:13.804 --> 25:15.931
What's that in your wig, boy'?

25:23.814 --> 25:24.940
Sand.

25:28.902 --> 25:29.987
See that.

25:30.154 --> 25:33.490
There is much, much less
than that

25:33.657 --> 25:36.076
between you working here

25:36.243 --> 25:38.454
and you being out
on your thick ear

25:38.620 --> 25:40.706
without a reference.

25:43.834 --> 25:45.753
"Lo!

25:45.919 --> 25:48.088
"We shall not...

25:48.255 --> 25:49.882
"shield..." ALBERT: No, no, no.

25:50.049 --> 25:51.675
"Yield," I think.

25:51.842 --> 25:52.926
Try again.

25:53.093 --> 25:57.139
We shall remain here
until you master it.

25:57.306 --> 25:58.932
It looks like "shield."

25:59.099 --> 26:00.976
How can one letter

26:01.143 --> 26:02.519
look like two'?

26:02.686 --> 26:04.188
"We shall not shield"?

26:04.354 --> 26:05.439
It's stupid.

26:05.606 --> 26:07.149
You're stupid. Bertie.

26:07.316 --> 26:09.026
Concentrate... again -.

26:09.193 --> 26:10.277
It's not fair.

26:10.444 --> 26:12.237
The letters won't stay still.

26:12.404 --> 26:14.114
They're all... swimming.

26:16.617 --> 26:18.994
That is not the behavior
of a future king.

26:19.161 --> 26:20.579
Why can't we do digging?

26:20.746 --> 26:24.458
Well, there is a time for spades

26:24.625 --> 26:28.921
and a time for books, no?

26:29.088 --> 26:30.380
Try again.

26:30.547 --> 26:31.632
"Lo!

26:31.799 --> 26:33.133
We shall not..."

26:37.179 --> 26:42.267
II'

26:42.434 --> 26:45.687
Lest we forget
we are on an island.

26:45.854 --> 26:49.149
You're an aficionado
of the decorative arts?

26:49.316 --> 26:52.569
I collect the decorative.

26:52.736 --> 26:55.322
It's my only vice, and secret.

26:55.489 --> 26:56.782
Hm.

26:56.949 --> 26:58.789
There are no secrets from God,
Lord Palmerston.

26:58.826 --> 27:00.953
He registers our every misdeed.

27:01.120 --> 27:03.539
Makes us pay for them.

27:06.083 --> 27:08.335
Wander what will be
the price? Of mine.

27:08.502 --> 27:11.672
1 really don't {want
to go back to Langenburgi-.

27:11.839 --> 27:13.674
Do make sure I don't.

27:13.841 --> 27:17.094
That would be the wise thing.

27:17.261 --> 27:20.931
The queen and her husband
detest you.

27:21.098 --> 27:24.393
How that antipathy would swell

27:24.560 --> 27:27.229
if they learned
about last night.

27:27.396 --> 27:30.232
II'

27:30.399 --> 27:32.109
Don't sulk.

27:32.276 --> 27:33.735
It doesn't suit you.

27:33.902 --> 27:37.322
II'

27:37.489 --> 27:39.032
Are we allowed
to discuss our son

27:39.199 --> 27:41.743
without you losing your temper?

27:41.910 --> 27:43.537
Bertie has
the perfect situation here

27:43.704 --> 27:44.913
in which to learn.

27:45.080 --> 27:46.307
Yau use that as a pretext
to? Keep us here.

27:46.331 --> 27:47.749
I see.

27:47.916 --> 27:50.544
And do you use Kossuth
as a pretext for us to leave?

27:51.879 --> 27:53.148
What I endeavor to achieve
with Bertie

27:53.172 --> 27:55.090
is an investment in the future.

27:55.257 --> 27:57.551
We, we cannot mindlessly exist
in the present.

27:57.718 --> 28:00.012
But is it mindless to consider
the respect of my subjects

28:00.179 --> 28:01.889
a thing worth having?

28:02.055 --> 28:03.775
Does it actually matter
whether the poor boy

28:03.932 --> 28:05.809
can or cannot
conjugate his verbs

28:05.976 --> 28:07.769
if he might not have
a throne to inherit?

28:07.936 --> 28:09.855
How dare you construe
that as vanity.

28:10.022 --> 28:13.108
The throne, Victoria, is secure.

28:13.275 --> 28:15.319
Yes, but currently unoccupied.

28:27.623 --> 28:30.876
I sought your dismissal,
you know.

28:33.337 --> 28:34.504
Lord John advised against it.

28:35.923 --> 28:37.090
Hm.

28:39.343 --> 28:40.761
Now make your case
about Kossuth.

28:42.971 --> 28:46.183
It is desirable...

28:46.350 --> 28:47.559
for the world to see

28:47.726 --> 28:49.046
that Britain is not afraid
of him.

28:49.186 --> 28:50.938
So, let him have his say.

28:51.104 --> 28:54.691
And when he has
delighted us enough,

28:54.858 --> 28:56.902
let us send him on
to somebody else.

28:59.905 --> 29:03.283
The <i>sands</i> will close over
the imprint of his visit,

29:03.450 --> 29:07.746
whereas Ycur Majesty
will be rightly celebrated

29:07.913 --> 29:09.831
for her tolerance
and willingness

29:09.998 --> 29:13.710
to let her subjects
have their free debate.

29:16.171 --> 29:18.757
You are the only constitutional
monarch in Europe.

29:18.924 --> 29:23.679
And your understanding of that
is clear for all to see.

29:23.845 --> 29:27.391
It's no bad thing
to keep the people on your side.

29:29.726 --> 29:33.397
Perplexing to hear you
style yourself my admirer.

29:33.563 --> 29:35.691
Not yours, ma'am.

29:35.857 --> 29:37.442
Britain's.

29:37.609 --> 29:41.822
Perhaps, after all,
you and I do think alike.

29:43.991 --> 29:45.242
Just a little.

29:45.409 --> 29:48.495
II'

29:49.663 --> 29:52.874
In any one day,

29:53.041 --> 29:54.126
you are allowed

29:54.293 --> 29:58.046
precisely 20 minutes of liberty.

29:58.213 --> 30:00.566
I think we just made pretty good use of it.
The rest of the time,

30:00.590 --> 30:02.759
she rings that bell,
day Qr night...

30:02.926 --> 30:04.195
Mothering Sunday
I get the whole day off.

30:04.219 --> 30:05.637
V0U go running.

30:05.804 --> 30:08.849
If that bell had rung just now,

30:09.016 --> 30:12.436
you'd have upped and gone,
even then, wouldn't you?

30:20.610 --> 30:22.738
My love...

30:22.904 --> 30:24.990
Now is the perfect moment.

30:25.157 --> 30:25.991
She's got a new child,
she's got...

30:26.158 --> 30:28.618
But she knew what I was.

30:28.785 --> 30:30.245
What I'd done.

30:30.412 --> 30:32.789
And she waved it all away.

30:32.956 --> 30:35.375
She gave me a new life.

30:41.631 --> 30:44.217
It's me offering you
a new life now.

30:44.384 --> 30:50.557
II'

30:59.483 --> 31:02.277
Sophie Monmouth
is out of bounds.

31:02.444 --> 31:05.572
Not to be used
for the amorous complications

31:05.739 --> 31:07.282
you have in mind.

31:10.035 --> 31:13.663
I ask this in remembrance
of our own complications.

31:15.123 --> 31:16.708
She cries out for something
we both know

31:16.875 --> 31:18.919
you will never give her.

31:19.086 --> 31:22.089
It would be cruel, Henry.

31:22.255 --> 31:29.054
II'

31:29.221 --> 31:31.306
I withdraw my artillery.

31:35.560 --> 31:39.815
II'

31:43.985 --> 31:48.865
II'

31:52.285 --> 31:55.038
It's truly the most
outstandingly vulgar building

31:55.205 --> 31:56.498
I've ever seen in my life.

31:58.166 --> 31:59.501
It is incongruous.

32:00.669 --> 32:02.796
A want of congruity

32:02.963 --> 32:04.047
is the least of its sins.

32:06.383 --> 32:09.177
And what of your sins, my lord?

32:13.306 --> 32:16.643
What an alarming question.

32:16.810 --> 32:19.210
Alas, I cannot stay to ventilate
the matter with you further.

32:19.271 --> 32:20.355
I have affairs of state.

32:20.522 --> 32:21.606
Shall I see you later?

32:21.773 --> 32:23.024
For what purpose, Duchess?

32:23.191 --> 32:24.484
For the purpose

32:24.651 --> 32:28.071
of consolidating
our acquaintance.

32:28.238 --> 32:30.824
Our acquaintance
is sufficiently consolidated.

32:30.991 --> 32:32.701
Don't you think?

32:34.035 --> 32:35.454
Listen.

32:35.620 --> 32:40.208
All can offer you
is pleasure and (distraction,

32:40.375 --> 32:41.769
and you may think
that's what you need,

32:41.793 --> 32:45.172
but it isn't.

32:45.338 --> 32:51.094
What you need,
I am not at liberty to give you.

32:51.261 --> 32:53.346
I'm so sorry.

33:01.855 --> 33:07.736
II'

33:10.322 --> 33:11.448
Get out of the way!

33:36.598 --> 33:37.849
Silly tears.

33:41.019 --> 33:42.246
Why must I look to seek comfort

33:42.270 --> 33:44.231
where it cannot possibly
be found?

33:46.775 --> 33:48.401
Oh, please say something.

33:49.861 --> 33:51.112
Your Grace, I...

33:53.573 --> 33:54.824
Listen.

33:56.535 --> 34:00.205
Can you hear the waves
folding over on the beach?

34:06.169 --> 34:10.215
It frightens me a little...
The sea.

34:10.382 --> 34:12.759
It makes me feel alive.

34:25.230 --> 34:26.648
Victoria.

34:26.815 --> 34:28.709
The new Austrian emperor
has dispatched ambassadors

34:28.733 --> 34:31.570
to every European country
except ours.

34:31.736 --> 34:34.239
Mine. Well,
clearly he finds us a liability...

34:34.406 --> 34:35.574
Leopold told me as much.

34:35.740 --> 34:39.869
Kossuth must be evicted.

34:40.036 --> 34:41.746
I have changed my mind.

34:45.542 --> 34:48.712
I have agreed that he should
be honored with a dinner.

34:50.046 --> 34:52.507
At which Palmerston
should preside.

34:52.674 --> 34:54.676
Two of a kind.

34:57.220 --> 34:59.340
He's told you that your people
will love you for this,

34:59.472 --> 35:02.517
and you wrap his words
around you like

35:03.977 --> 35:05.103
cloak.

35:12.652 --> 35:13.737
Skerrett...

35:13.903 --> 35:16.406
Oh, I do apologize,
Your Majesty.

35:19.743 --> 35:21.661
Are you quite well?

35:23.538 --> 35:25.415
What's the matter? Tell me.

35:27.751 --> 35:30.003
Have you broken something?

35:30.170 --> 35:31.963
Come on,
you know I shan“: Be angry.

35:32.130 --> 35:34.507
I desire to leave your service,
ma'am.

35:37.260 --> 35:39.179
For the sake of my marriage.

35:41.723 --> 35:43.141
Marriage.

35:43.308 --> 35:46.770
To Mr. Francatelli.

35:46.936 --> 35:50.023
I had no wish to keep it secret
from you, ma'am, I just...

35:53.151 --> 35:55.278
I just couldn't...

35:57.364 --> 36:00.367
It is time...

36:00.533 --> 36:01.618
for me to go.

36:01.785 --> 36:09.376
II'

36:09.542 --> 36:11.252
I'm so sorry.

36:11.419 --> 36:16.299
II'

36:29.646 --> 36:36.611
II'

37:01.886 --> 37:02.971
Hm.

37:06.057 --> 37:09.602
In what respect does une vache
translate as "a hammer"?

37:09.769 --> 37:13.356
How would one milk a hammer?

37:13.523 --> 37:15.650
I don't bloody know!

37:18.903 --> 37:21.239
Right.

37:21.406 --> 37:23.283
Go to your room... shall follow.

37:23.450 --> 37:25.285
Please don't.
Please do not interfere.

37:25.452 --> 37:27.120
Please don't bully my child.

37:27.287 --> 37:30.832
Victoria, I have never bullied
our child, and I never shall,

37:30.999 --> 37:33.018
but it must be made clear to the boy.
It's perfectly clear

37:33.042 --> 37:35.003
how little you value
his attempts to please you.

37:35.170 --> 37:36.171
Clear to us all.

37:36.337 --> 37:37.815
Victoria, by God,
you're being inappropriate.

37:37.839 --> 37:39.424
If you find me
inappropriate, Albert,

37:39.591 --> 37:40.818
either remark upon it privately,

37:40.842 --> 37:41.885
or if you insist

37:42.051 --> 37:43.571
on drawing the matter
to the attention of the court,

37:43.595 --> 37:45.638
address me with respect.

37:45.805 --> 37:50.018
If you were deserving
of respect, Your Majesty...

37:53.188 --> 37:54.355
then I should.

37:58.902 --> 38:01.613
II'

38:12.123 --> 38:15.293
II'

38:20.006 --> 38:21.758
Really.

38:21.925 --> 38:24.928
One quite understands.

38:26.179 --> 38:28.890
The wine was not good.

38:31.518 --> 38:33.394
May I speak frankly?

38:35.897 --> 38:39.067
I agree with you.

38:39.234 --> 38:44.072
Oh, how I wish we could return
to London so we could breathe.

38:45.657 --> 38:47.200
My dear, the Peninsular War,

38:47.367 --> 38:49.452
surely it never
went on this long.

38:53.081 --> 38:57.126
Albert is a kind man,

38:57.293 --> 39:00.505
but it is observed

39:00.672 --> 39:02.465
that he constricts you.

39:06.427 --> 39:07.554
Observed by whom?

39:07.720 --> 39:09.389
Who says such a thing?

39:09.556 --> 39:11.182
People of little consequence.

39:11.349 --> 39:13.351
Silly, talkative women.

39:16.563 --> 39:19.107
My only desire
is to serve you, Drina,

39:19.274 --> 39:23.820
but if I hear something
detrimental to your authority,

39:23.987 --> 39:25.363
I must tell it.

39:25.530 --> 39:29.367
That is all I say.

39:29.534 --> 39:31.452
Now cut off my head.

39:33.663 --> 39:35.874
I know you find me disagreeable.

39:36.040 --> 39:37.500
Fee...

39:39.836 --> 39:42.255
How could you say such a thing?

39:42.422 --> 39:46.301
II'

39:53.975 --> 39:56.603
Of course.

39:56.769 --> 39:59.480
She is upset.

39:59.647 --> 40:02.358
To be obliged to withdraw
from London

40:02.525 --> 40:03.776
is insupportable.

40:03.943 --> 40:05.528
I see that.

40:05.695 --> 40:09.157
May I... speak frankly?

40:11.826 --> 40:15.246
It seems to me
that there is a simple test

40:15.413 --> 40:19.792
whether or not a man
has married the right woman.

40:19.959 --> 40:23.296
The man must ask himself:
This wife of mine,

40:23.463 --> 40:26.507
does she increase me
or diminish me?

40:26.674 --> 40:28.384
Am I more of a man
because of her?

40:28.551 --> 40:30.094
Or less?

40:30.261 --> 40:34.849
Marriage to Victoria
has undoubtedly increased me.

40:35.016 --> 40:37.685
It continues to increase me.

40:37.852 --> 40:40.647
I am infinitely more a man
because of her.

40:42.065 --> 40:43.983
<i>Good.</i>

40:44.150 --> 40:46.027
Then all is well.

40:46.194 --> 40:47.946
This will blow over.

40:49.614 --> 40:53.409
My sister is a little
<i>difficile</i> at present.

40:53.576 --> 40:54.994
That is the strain

40:55.161 --> 40:58.873
of the feminine humors.

40:59.040 --> 41:01.542
Repeated childbirth.

41:01.709 --> 41:03.252
Makes women stupid.

41:03.419 --> 41:07.006
Are you suggesting
that Victoria's sanity depends

41:07.173 --> 41:08.841
on she and I having no more...

41:10.843 --> 41:12.512
"children?"

41:12.679 --> 41:13.805
No! No.

41:13.972 --> 41:15.932
Of course not!

41:16.099 --> 41:18.601
The disorder of her mind
is strictly temporary.

41:22.105 --> 41:23.940
Not at all like
her dear grandpapds.

41:39.998 --> 41:41.238
Will that be all, Your Majesty?

41:41.290 --> 41:42.667
Apparently so.

41:42.834 --> 41:47.463
II'

41:59.475 --> 42:06.399
II'

42:27.045 --> 42:28.880
What day is it today?

42:29.047 --> 42:30.423
Remind me.

42:32.425 --> 42:33.259
Sunday, Mr. Penge.

42:33.426 --> 42:34.802
Sunday.

42:34.969 --> 42:40.850
And what do we do
on a Sunday morning,

42:41.017 --> 42:42.268
wherever we happen to be?

42:45.021 --> 42:47.815
We go to church,
you bloody heathen!

42:47.982 --> 42:49.317
Yes, Mr. Penge.

42:49.484 --> 42:50.818
"Yes, Mr. Penge."

42:50.985 --> 42:53.071
You're not in Chatsworth, now.
Sir...

42:53.237 --> 42:55.364
And don't speak
while I'm shouting at you!

42:58.034 --> 42:59.368
Where were you?

43:01.537 --> 43:03.331
Bathing, Mr. Penge.

43:03.498 --> 43:05.249
Bathing.

43:05.416 --> 43:07.210
In the sea.

43:13.966 --> 43:15.259
Do you smell that?

43:17.345 --> 43:18.971
That's your goose.

43:19.138 --> 43:21.641
Well and truly cooked.

43:32.443 --> 43:36.030
To whom do you write
so assiduously, Duchess?

43:36.197 --> 43:38.825
My son.

43:38.991 --> 43:41.702
I trust they will allow him
letters at this wretched school.

43:45.456 --> 43:48.709
Last night... at the table...

43:48.876 --> 43:50.461
I think it would be good
for all of us

43:50.628 --> 43:52.380
if we were to return to London.

43:54.549 --> 43:57.468
Relations between the inmates
of a country house party

43:57.635 --> 43:59.846
can very soon become...

44:00.012 --> 44:01.514
eccentric.

44:07.061 --> 44:09.981
Where is, um...
I don't know his name.

44:10.148 --> 44:11.440
The large fellow?

44:11.607 --> 44:13.734
Joseph, Your Grace.

44:13.901 --> 44:15.444
He has been dismissed.

44:15.611 --> 44:17.947
Whatever for?

44:18.114 --> 44:20.867
Skipping church, ma'am.

44:21.033 --> 44:23.411
II'

44:29.876 --> 44:30.877
K! Good.

44:31.043 --> 44:36.424
II'

44:38.926 --> 44:40.386
S! Good.

44:40.553 --> 44:44.849
II'

44:48.394 --> 44:49.394
'v!

44:49.437 --> 44:50.771
No, no, no, no, no.

44:50.938 --> 44:52.023
A little...

44:52.190 --> 44:54.442
A little bigger than a V.

44:57.069 --> 44:58.821
W!

44:58.988 --> 45:00.698
Is... correct.

45:05.286 --> 45:08.414
So you are leaving?

45:08.581 --> 45:09.999
We are, sir.

45:11.459 --> 45:13.544
Enjoy your dinner with Kossuth.

45:13.711 --> 45:15.922
I shall do my best, sir.

45:16.088 --> 45:20.301
It is the queen's command
that I should.

45:20.468 --> 45:27.266
II'

45:33.481 --> 45:36.734
You weren't going
without saying goodbye?

45:38.069 --> 45:39.237
Taking French leave.

45:40.488 --> 45:42.198
Good heavens, no, ma'am.

45:42.365 --> 45:43.717
But interestingly,
the French call it

45:43.741 --> 45:44.867
<i>partir comme un angiais.</i>

45:45.034 --> 45:46.410
"To leave like an Englishman."

45:46.577 --> 45:48.788
Your time in office
has taught you something.

45:48.955 --> 45:50.039
Indeed, ma'am.

45:50.206 --> 45:51.832
It has also taught me

45:51.999 --> 45:54.877
that when the queen tells me
to do a thing,

45:55.044 --> 45:57.338
she probably has
a good reason for it.

45:58.506 --> 45:59.340
Did you doubt it?

45:59.507 --> 46:00.883
I did, ma'am.

46:01.050 --> 46:02.927
As you doubted me.

46:09.475 --> 46:12.603
1 shall see you in London,
Lord Palmerston.

46:14.397 --> 46:17.650
I hope so, ma'am.

46:17.817 --> 46:19.860
And before too long.

46:20.027 --> 46:23.864
II'

46:38.921 --> 46:41.090
So, the unwelcome guests
have departed.

46:41.257 --> 46:42.341
Albert...

46:42.508 --> 46:44.510
<i>Afresh start.</i>

46:46.429 --> 46:49.598
I'm going back to London.

46:49.765 --> 46:54.562
You can remain here,
if you wish.

46:57.898 --> 47:01.235
II'

47:01.402 --> 47:03.362
Yes, yes, perfect.

47:03.529 --> 47:05.573
Thank you very much»
that can go...

47:05.740 --> 47:12.079
II'

47:13.247 --> 47:14.540
I'm looking for the steward.

47:18.002 --> 47:19.712
Mr. Penge.

47:22.381 --> 47:25.051
Can I help you, Your Grace?

47:25.217 --> 47:27.887
The man Joseph»
is that his name?

47:28.054 --> 47:29.555
I gather you have dismissed him.

47:29.722 --> 47:31.098
Indeed, Your Grace, he failed...

47:31.265 --> 47:33.476
He was performing
a service for me.

47:35.603 --> 47:37.104
An errand, a trivial thing.

47:37.271 --> 47:38.356
But you see, I am to blame.

47:38.522 --> 47:40.358
Not the... the man.

47:40.524 --> 47:42.109
What is his name again?

47:43.361 --> 47:44.487
Joseph, Your Grace.

47:45.863 --> 47:47.031
So it strikes one as unjust

47:47.198 --> 47:50.451
that this Joseph
should be punished.

47:54.747 --> 47:55.831
Yes, Your Grace.

47:55.998 --> 47:57.291
<i>Good.</i>

47:58.501 --> 48:00.836
Well, that's that.

48:05.257 --> 48:08.010
II'

48:13.391 --> 48:16.310
Well, well, well.

48:16.477 --> 48:18.104
II'

48:22.775 --> 48:27.655
II'

48:31.575 --> 48:35.037
II'

48:54.598 --> 48:57.268
II'

49:14.952 --> 49:15.786
Gentlemen.

49:15.953 --> 49:18.330
And guests.

49:18.497 --> 49:21.292
We are privileged to welcome.

49:21.459 --> 49:24.253
Herr Kossuth of Hungary
to address us

49:24.420 --> 49:27.715
on the character of democracy.

49:27.882 --> 49:29.758
Sir.

49:29.925 --> 49:32.636
Foreign Secretary, thank you.

49:34.180 --> 49:36.307
In the course
of an eventful life,

49:36.474 --> 49:38.934
I have learned

49:39.101 --> 49:43.189
that not all democracies
are equally democratic.

49:45.900 --> 49:47.276
Though still I have...

49:48.861 --> 49:51.530
The noble pride
of my principles,

49:51.697 --> 49:57.703
and though I have the
inspiration of a just cause...

50:05.628 --> 50:08.589
The people await their queen.

50:10.883 --> 50:13.135
As she awaits to be adored.

50:19.141 --> 50:25.231
II'

50:44.208 --> 50:50.923
II'

50:58.013 --> 51:02.059
II'

51:09.984 --> 51:14.863
II'

51:24.957 --> 51:28.502
II'

51:54.069 --> 51:56.572
One more week.

51:56.739 --> 51:58.657
You'll miss it when it's gone.

51:58.824 --> 52:00.409
I shall.

52:02.328 --> 52:05.372
That doesn't mean this isn't
the right thing to do.

52:07.541 --> 52:13.589
II'

52:13.756 --> 52:15.966
What the hell
do you think you're doing?

52:18.177 --> 52:20.262
I'm...

52:20.429 --> 52:24.558
I'm comforting my wife,
Mr. Penge.

52:24.725 --> 52:25.809
What are you doing?

52:25.976 --> 52:31.440
II'

52:55.297 --> 52:56.382
Albert?

52:58.634 --> 53:01.845
Albert, let me in, my darling.

53:02.012 --> 53:03.639
Albert, please.

53:06.934 --> 53:10.396
II'

53:16.568 --> 53:21.448
II'

53:30.124 --> 53:35.003
II'
