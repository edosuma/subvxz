or ever became

was because of him,

07:09.196 --> 07:12.464

07:20.707 --> 07:22.707

a boyfriend

07:22.709 --> 07:24.376

07:24.378 --> 07:26.211
Homer, I'm a

07:26.213 --> 07:29.114
who's home-straight
and highway-gay,

07:29.116 --> 07:31.283
but, uh, how do you know
about Grinder?

07:31.285 --> 07:32.918
My wife put me on to it.

07:32.920 --> 07:34.920
I was looking for an app
for pepper grinders,

07:34.922 --> 07:36.221
and I found this.

07:36.223 --> 07:38.390
Uh, doesn't Smithers
dig Burns?

07:38.392 --> 07:40.625
Yeah, but Burns
doesn't want Smithers.

07:40.627 --> 07:43.929
Isn't it sad, Marge,
when somebody really,

07:43.931 --> 07:47.065

really wants somebody,

07:47.067 --> 07:48.900
and they're sitting

07:50.270 --> 07:52.971

for the Internet.

08:07.254 --> 08:09.087
Hmm, no.

08:09.089 --> 08:10.088

08:10.090 --> 08:11.089

08:11.091 --> 08:12.123

08:24.771 --> 08:26.671
Hey, why am I on this?

08:26.673 --> 08:28.106
Well, only one way
to find out.

08:28.108 --> 08:29.674
Swipe.

08:29.676 --> 08:32.677
Maybe we should just
invite them all to a party

08:32.679 --> 08:34.779
and see
who Mr. Smithers likes.

08:34.781 --> 08:36.147
Good idea.

08:36.149 --> 08:39.284
(with dramatic affectation):
Did somebody here swipe me?

08:39.286 --> 08:40.452
Here's five bucks.

08:40.454 --> 08:41.853
Visit my Dad.
Say you're me.

08:41.855 --> 08:44.523
Finally, I'm paid to act.

08:46.025 --> 08:47.158
Tell you what,

08:47.160 --> 08:49.027
if you buy a half-page ad
in the program,

08:49.029 --> 08:52.697
Sam plays "As Time Goes By"
with Hulk hands.

08:52.699 --> 08:54.032
(register dings)
You have a deal.

08:56.702 --> 08:59.137
I'm glad someone's getting
something from this play.

08:59.139 --> 09:00.805
(sighs)

09:00.807 --> 09:02.707
As an understudy,
all I get is to watch

09:02.709 --> 09:04.976
Lisa and Jack fall in love.

09:04.978 --> 09:07.379
Oh, you're still here.

09:09.015 --> 09:11.883
Look, Milhouse,
if anything happens

09:11.885 --> 09:13.985
to that kid playing Rick...

09:13.987 --> 09:15.220
you get the part.

09:15.222 --> 09:17.022
If you catch my drift.

09:17.024 --> 09:18.990
You know I can't catch.

09:18.992 --> 09:20.992
(slurping)

09:20.994 --> 09:23.295
Don't judge me.

09:24.830 --> 09:26.164
Jack, you're amazing.

09:26.166 --> 09:28.800
You're blowing away
everyone else in the play.

09:30.169 --> 09:34.039
(in Peter Lorre voice):
You despise me, don't you?

09:34.041 --> 09:35.907
(in Humphrey Bogart voice):
If I gave you any thought,

09:35.909 --> 09:38.176
I probably would.

09:38.178 --> 09:39.911
(in normal voice):
I'll be in my trailer.

09:41.047 --> 09:42.847
This isn't Fiji water.

09:42.849 --> 09:46.718
Yo, dingus, someone doesn't
want you in that play.

09:46.720 --> 09:49.220
Who let you three gorillas
out of the zoo?

09:49.222 --> 09:50.221
(laughs)

09:50.223 --> 09:51.222
Gorillas.

09:51.224 --> 09:53.558
It's not funny.

09:53.560 --> 09:54.759
(grunting, shouting)

09:54.761 --> 09:56.027
How'd you get the bullies

09:56.029 --> 09:57.362
to take out Jack?

09:57.364 --> 09:58.897
The most powerful bribe
in the world:

09:58.899 --> 10:02.100
a free full-page ad
in the play program.

10:03.869 --> 10:06.237
It's a funny thing about fists,
everyone gets them,

10:06.239 --> 10:09.107
but not everyone gets
the instruction manual.

10:09.109 --> 10:13.311
Oh, no, his mouth wrote checks
his fists <i>could</i> cash!

10:15.414 --> 10:16.715
(gasps)

10:16.717 --> 10:18.049
Someone is using the go-round

10:18.051 --> 10:19.751
for non-merry purposes.

10:19.753 --> 10:22.921
Attention: in <i>Casablanca,</i>
<i>the part of Rick Blaine</i>

10:22.923 --> 10:24.255
will now be played by Milhouse.

10:24.257 --> 10:26.725
Also, the cafeteria
is out of buns,

10:26.727 --> 10:28.126
so for hamburgers
we will now be using

10:28.128 --> 10:30.061
two slices of day-old toast.

10:30.063 --> 10:31.563
That is all.

10:31.565 --> 10:34.299
(crunching loudly)

10:35.134 --> 10:38.069
Where you're going,
I can't...

10:38.071 --> 10:39.104
Line!

10:39.106 --> 10:40.739
Follow!

10:40.741 --> 10:41.973
Sounds weird to me.

10:41.975 --> 10:43.274
"I can't follow."

10:43.276 --> 10:45.110
"I can't follow."

10:45.112 --> 10:47.979
Also, why would Nazis
respect letters of transit

10:47.981 --> 10:49.247
signed by De Gaulle?

10:49.249 --> 10:51.416
I may be pulling on a thread,
but hear me out...

10:51.418 --> 10:53.151
(groans)

10:56.288 --> 10:58.089
Everything looks
great, Marge.

10:58.091 --> 11:00.091
That cheese is
cubed perfectly.

11:00.093 --> 11:01.092
Thank you.

11:01.094 --> 11:02.093
I get queasy when I see

11:02.095 --> 11:03.928
cubes that are cut
on the bias.

11:03.930 --> 11:04.929
(doorbell rings)

11:04.931 --> 11:07.766
Oh, Mr. Smithers.

11:07.768 --> 11:08.967
Come in, come in, come in.

11:08.969 --> 11:10.935
Can I get you
a Tom Collins?

11:10.937 --> 11:13.038
Hello, Tom Collins.

11:14.140 --> 11:16.007
Hmm, I see
what's going on here.

11:16.009 --> 11:18.977
Fix up your boss
so he won't be so hard on you.

11:18.979 --> 11:21.312
Well, nice try.

11:21.314 --> 11:25.116
I want a vodka tonic,
and then I'm gonna leave.

11:25.118 --> 11:28.119
Mr. Collins, would you be
charmed by horror stories

11:28.121 --> 11:29.954
of working
with Bill Shatner?

11:29.956 --> 11:30.955
Uh, who?

11:30.957 --> 11:32.490
I like you already.

11:32.492 --> 11:34.125
You know what?

11:34.127 --> 11:36.127
I don't think that attitude
is the real you.

11:36.129 --> 11:39.130
I believe you have
a pinched nerve in your neck,

11:39.132 --> 11:40.465
and guess what?

11:40.467 --> 11:43.968
You're in luck,
because I give great massage.

11:43.970 --> 11:45.136
Sorry, not interested.

11:45.138 --> 11:45.970
(bones popping)

11:45.972 --> 11:47.338
Wow, wow.

11:47.340 --> 11:49.140
How did you do that?

11:49.142 --> 11:51.976
Would you like to discuss that
over Peruvian tapas?

11:51.978 --> 11:54.012
Simpson, I'm stealing
your bartender.

11:54.014 --> 11:55.013
Take the next
couple days off.

11:55.015 --> 11:56.047
Woo-hoo!

11:56.049 --> 11:57.716
Three day bender!

11:59.985 --> 12:02.854
Are there any gay-themed songs
about celebrating?

12:02.856 --> 12:05.156
♪ Celebrate

12:05.158 --> 12:06.491
♪ Good times, come on

12:06.493 --> 12:09.160

12:09.162 --> 12:11.362
Did you used to jog

12:11.364 --> 12:13.498
Mm, sort of.

12:13.500 --> 12:17.836

12:26.545 --> 12:27.746
(door opens)

12:27.748 --> 12:30.014
(humming)

12:30.016 --> 12:31.916
Smithers, where have you been?

12:31.918 --> 12:33.551
I'm dictating my autobiography.

12:33.553 --> 12:36.020
Chapter One: A Commotion
at the Telegraph Office.

12:36.022 --> 12:38.056
I'm afraid I have other plans.

12:38.058 --> 12:39.224
There are no other plans.

12:39.226 --> 12:40.992
Now take my picture
for the back cover.

12:42.094 --> 12:44.062
No, sir, I don't think I will.

12:44.064 --> 12:47.031
In fact, what I'm going
to do is...

12:47.033 --> 12:48.600
quit!

12:48.602 --> 12:51.269
(gasps) My God, I did it.

12:51.271 --> 12:52.270
I actually quit.

12:52.272 --> 12:54.439
No one quits me.

12:56.108 --> 12:56.641
(groans)

12:59.378 --> 13:01.045
One more button.

13:01.047 --> 13:02.380
(screams)

13:02.382 --> 13:05.150
You're forgetting
who installed this system.

13:06.218 --> 13:07.285
Ahoy-hoy!

13:12.892 --> 13:14.559
So, you want time off
for your sister's funeral?

13:14.561 --> 13:15.560
(laughs)

13:15.562 --> 13:16.594
Miss Naegle,

13:16.596 --> 13:19.097
release the hounds.

13:19.099 --> 13:20.098
Wh-What do you mean?

13:20.100 --> 13:22.901
Send vicious dogs
to rip him to shreds.

13:22.903 --> 13:25.069
But wouldn't I be
criminally liable?

13:25.071 --> 13:26.070
I said release!

13:26.072 --> 13:26.971
Release, release!

13:26.973 --> 13:29.407
That sounds vaguely sexual.

13:29.409 --> 13:31.142
I'm gonna have to file
a grievance.

13:31.144 --> 13:34.145
Also, let's just see how you've
been treating those hounds.

13:34.147 --> 13:35.079
What the...

13:35.081 --> 13:35.947
Okay, we're gonna have

13:35.949 --> 13:38.082
to shut this all down.

13:38.084 --> 13:39.918
You know, he doesn't
give me health insurance...

13:39.920 --> 13:42.587
and I, uh,
I think I have rabies.

13:42.589 --> 13:43.988
Okay, that's it,
Mr. Burns.

13:43.990 --> 13:45.123
I'm gonna need to speak

13:45.125 --> 13:46.958
to your head
of Human Resources.

13:46.960 --> 13:48.326
It's this guy.

13:54.099 --> 13:55.967
Um... what are you doing?

13:55.969 --> 13:56.968
Oh, sorry.

13:56.970 --> 13:58.169
I used to do that
for Mr. Burns.

13:58.171 --> 14:00.171
Ah, forget about Burns.

14:00.173 --> 14:01.639
Ancient-a history.

14:01.641 --> 14:04.108
I left-a the Italy
40 years ago,

14:04.110 --> 14:06.110
but do you see me-a crying

14:06.112 --> 14:09.948
in my <i>pappardelle rustiche</i>
<i>con salsiccia e porri?</i>

14:09.950 --> 14:12.383
Waylon, just what
did you see in him?

14:17.656 --> 14:21.359
Now to set her down gently
on the golf course.

14:26.632 --> 14:28.299
You're right, totally.

14:28.301 --> 14:29.534
I'm here for you.

14:29.536 --> 14:32.003
Listen, I'm making
a trip to Cuba, okay?

14:32.005 --> 14:34.005
My homeland,
where my accent

14:34.007 --> 14:36.174
is not so reedickoloss.

14:36.176 --> 14:38.142
Come with me to Havana.

14:38.144 --> 14:41.479
(Cuban music plays)

14:41.481 --> 14:43.214
SMITHERS:
<i>W-wait a minute.</i>

14:43.216 --> 14:45.016
<i>I'm... not sure.</i>

14:45.018 --> 14:47.018
But this is the route
we're gonna take.

14:47.020 --> 14:47.986
Oh, what the hell,

14:47.988 --> 14:49.320
this is gonna be
the time of my life.

14:49.322 --> 14:51.122
I'm in!

14:52.491 --> 14:53.992
(crying)

14:53.994 --> 14:56.327
Milhouse is the worst actor
I've ever seen,

14:56.329 --> 14:59.230
and I have to play
opposite him!

14:59.232 --> 15:01.032
He's so bad.

15:01.034 --> 15:03.167
Look at his headshot.

15:03.169 --> 15:05.336
(Marge groans)

15:05.338 --> 15:07.005
Whenever I'm dealing
with someone who

15:07.007 --> 15:08.539
isn't doing a great job,

15:08.541 --> 15:11.509
what I do is treat them
like they're perfect.

15:11.511 --> 15:12.844
(sniffles)
Really?

15:12.846 --> 15:14.579
If they sense
you believe in them,

15:14.581 --> 15:15.880
they'll get better.

15:15.882 --> 15:17.515
Did our taxes, Marge.

15:17.517 --> 15:19.918
The government
owes us $2 million.

15:19.920 --> 15:22.186
That is really, really great,

15:22.188 --> 15:23.855
but maybe
you should check again.

15:23.857 --> 15:24.856
What?

15:24.858 --> 15:26.090
Oh, I... my mistake.

15:26.092 --> 15:27.725
We owe them $37.

15:27.727 --> 15:29.761
That's some nice adding.

15:29.763 --> 15:31.462
Yeah.

15:34.934 --> 15:37.435
(Cuban music playing)

15:38.370 --> 15:39.704
I've done it.

15:39.706 --> 15:40.705
I'm happy.

15:40.707 --> 15:42.073
I'm in a new world

15:42.075 --> 15:43.441
and completely
forgotten about...

15:43.443 --> 15:44.442
(shouts)

15:44.444 --> 15:45.910
What, the buzzard of death?

15:45.912 --> 15:46.945
(gasps)

15:46.947 --> 15:48.780
It reminds you of him!

15:48.782 --> 15:49.781
I'm sorry, sir.

15:49.783 --> 15:50.949
(gasps)

15:50.951 --> 15:52.917
You address me
like I am him.

15:52.919 --> 15:54.786
Everything reminds you
of him!

15:54.788 --> 15:57.055
I bet that mural of him

15:57.057 --> 15:59.257
being driven out
of Cuba in 1959

15:59.259 --> 16:01.726
reminds you of him!

16:01.728 --> 16:06.297
Waylon, I am a man who needs
100% commitment, okay?

16:07.399 --> 16:09.300
Okay, well, maybe not 100,

16:09.302 --> 16:11.936
but at least, like, 20,
you know, which is

16:11.938 --> 16:13.938
the percentage that
your cell phone needs

16:13.940 --> 16:15.106
to stay in the green.

16:15.108 --> 16:16.741
So tell me now, Waylon.

16:16.743 --> 16:18.910
Am I in the green?

16:18.912 --> 16:19.744
(sighs)

16:19.746 --> 16:21.646
I'm afraid not.

16:23.082 --> 16:27.752
(sobbing) Beneath this mask
I am crying.

16:27.754 --> 16:28.920
Everyone who's
replaced Smithers

16:28.922 --> 16:30.288
has been nothing
but trouble.

16:30.290 --> 16:31.956
You're my lawyers,
tell me what to do.

16:31.958 --> 16:35.426
Sir, I think your only option
is to get Mr. Smithers back.

16:35.428 --> 16:36.627
You'll have to give him money.

16:36.629 --> 16:39.130
Lots of money,
but it won't be enough.

16:39.132 --> 16:40.264
(lawyers muttering agreement)

16:40.266 --> 16:42.300
Yes, I suppose
what this calls for

16:42.302 --> 16:45.837
is a personal apology
straight from my heart.

16:45.839 --> 16:48.606
Have it on my desk
first thing tomorrow...

16:48.608 --> 16:51.642
and write yourselves apologies
from me to you

16:51.644 --> 16:53.177
for making you work late,

16:53.179 --> 16:56.581
and they'd better
sound sincere.

17:03.956 --> 17:05.990
You're going to be great.

17:05.992 --> 17:07.625
I already am...

17:07.627 --> 17:09.794
because you just
told me so.

17:09.796 --> 17:10.795
Oh.

17:10.797 --> 17:11.863
(giggles)

17:11.865 --> 17:13.197
Thank you.

17:13.199 --> 17:16.801
So, what brought you
to Casablanca?

17:16.803 --> 17:19.537
I came here for the waters.

17:19.539 --> 17:22.640
There are no waters
in Casablanca.

17:22.642 --> 17:24.976
I was misinformed.

17:24.978 --> 17:26.677
(audience cheers)

17:26.679 --> 17:29.480
Is it just me or is Milhouse
really killing it?

17:29.482 --> 17:31.749
He's like
a young Noah Wylie.

17:32.985 --> 17:34.152
(groans)

17:34.154 --> 17:35.853
If that plane
leaves the ground

17:35.855 --> 17:37.989
and you're not with him,
you'll regret it.

17:37.991 --> 17:40.992
Maybe not today,
maybe not tomorrow,

17:40.994 --> 17:43.828
but soon and for the rest
of your life.

17:43.830 --> 17:44.829
(audience cheers)

17:44.831 --> 17:46.664
You did it, Marge.

17:46.666 --> 17:48.699
This earns
my highest praise:

17:48.701 --> 17:50.401
get through-able.

17:54.540 --> 17:57.041
Milhouse,
you were incredible.

17:57.043 --> 17:59.077
Maybe that's because...

17:59.079 --> 18:01.179
I'm not Milhouse.

18:01.181 --> 18:02.880
(gasps)

18:02.882 --> 18:04.916
Oh, but,
is Milhouse okay?

18:04.918 --> 18:06.851
Is Milhouse ever okay?

18:06.853 --> 18:08.052
Good point. (laughs)

18:08.054 --> 18:10.188
Now let's go
to the soda fountain

18:10.190 --> 18:12.690
and ask the jerk
for a float with two straws.

18:12.692 --> 18:14.192
What year are you from?

18:14.194 --> 18:15.193
(laughs)

18:15.195 --> 18:16.828
Oh, who cares?

18:18.030 --> 18:20.531
Mr. Burns, Mr. Smithers,

18:20.533 --> 18:24.569
I make-a something
very special for your reunion.

18:24.571 --> 18:26.104
One cheese pizza.

18:26.106 --> 18:27.371
Well, Smithers,
I got here

18:27.373 --> 18:28.873
as soon as I heard
you wanted to meet.

18:28.875 --> 18:31.042
Took something called Uber,
which I thought would be

18:31.044 --> 18:33.211
a Wehrmacht staff car,
but turned out to be a...

18:33.213 --> 18:34.212
(groans)

18:34.214 --> 18:35.379
Prius, driven by a...

18:35.381 --> 18:36.714
(groans)
woman.

18:36.716 --> 18:38.015
Now, down to business.

18:40.052 --> 18:41.619
<i>It's all here.</i>

18:41.621 --> 18:43.054
<i>Everything it'll take</i>
<i>to get him back.</i>

18:43.056 --> 18:44.455
<i>Oh, no, forgot</i>
<i>the Starbucks card.</i>

18:44.457 --> 18:45.456
<i>Is it too late to...</i>

18:45.458 --> 18:46.557
Sir, before you start,

18:46.559 --> 18:47.925
let me say I don't want money,

18:47.927 --> 18:50.895
and I don't want some letter
written by your lawyers.

18:50.897 --> 18:52.263
I want to know
why you want me back.

18:52.265 --> 18:54.765
I see.

18:54.767 --> 18:56.467
Well, the thing is,

18:56.469 --> 18:59.070
you really care about me,
don't you?

18:59.072 --> 19:01.572
Maybe a little, still.

19:01.574 --> 19:02.940
All right, Smithers.

19:02.942 --> 19:04.408
There's one thing
I've never given you.

19:04.410 --> 19:06.811
I kept it bottled up
inside all these years

19:06.813 --> 19:07.945
and here it is...

19:07.947 --> 19:09.313
your performance review.

19:09.315 --> 19:10.314
(gasps)

19:10.316 --> 19:12.150
It's... excellent.

19:12.152 --> 19:14.418
Amazingly, that's enough.

19:14.420 --> 19:15.486
Thank you, sir.

19:15.488 --> 19:19.090
♪ You must remember this

19:19.092 --> 19:21.959
♪ A kiss is just a kiss...

19:21.961 --> 19:23.728
No music!

19:30.102 --> 19:31.936
I heard you serve
10-year-olds.

19:31.938 --> 19:34.005
That's referring to the age
of the pickled eggs,

19:34.007 --> 19:36.007
but, uh, I'll get you a milk.

19:37.276 --> 19:39.777
Mr. Smithers,
why do guys do

19:39.779 --> 19:42.280
such stupid things
when it comes to dames?

19:42.282 --> 19:44.682
Hey, you been talking
to that weird Bogart kid?

19:44.684 --> 19:46.617
He came around here
trying to talk me

19:46.619 --> 19:49.120
into an expedition
to find some gold.

19:49.122 --> 19:51.789
Yeah, so I'm getting
the mules.

19:51.791 --> 19:53.457
Let me tell you about dames,
Milhouse.

19:53.459 --> 19:55.660
I know nothing about them,
but as for love,

19:55.662 --> 19:57.695
what keeps you going
is the thrill of the chase.

19:57.697 --> 19:59.297
The possibility
that one day you

19:59.299 --> 20:01.132
might get what you want,
even though the reality is

20:01.134 --> 20:03.301
you probably never will.

20:03.303 --> 20:05.303
That's why I don't
chase dames.

20:05.305 --> 20:06.537
Just gold.

20:06.539 --> 20:08.139
I'll be back in six months

20:08.141 --> 20:09.540
with one-third
of the biggest treasure

20:09.542 --> 20:11.342
you ever saw.

20:11.344 --> 20:13.878

Shh!

21:27.919 --> 21:29.787
You've just watched
The Simpsons.

21:29.789 --> 21:32.623
Now here are a few more shows
to check out from Fox.

21:33.558 --> 21:35.459
Welcome to the toughest
challenge of your life.

21:35.461 --> 21:37.828
<i>Four decorated heroes--</i>

21:37.830 --> 21:39.463

gunshot)

21:39.465 --> 21:41.565
will train 16 civilians--

21:41.567 --> 21:43.734
-(horn blows)
-Whoo!

21:43.736 --> 21:45.670
just like they were military.

21:45.672 --> 21:48.005
Let's go!
Get down here now!

21:48.007 --> 21:50.341
-John Cena hosts
<i>a team competition--</i>
<i>-ALL: Booyah!</i>

21:50.343 --> 21:53.077
where you're only as strong
as your weakest link.

21:53.079 --> 21:54.478
We would have been better off
without you there.

21:54.480 --> 21:56.447
<i>-You give up--</i>
<i>-I'm-a stop this now.</i>

21:56.449 --> 21:57.948
You will be pushed!

21:57.950 --> 22:00.351
-you go home.
-WOMAN: No, no, no!
