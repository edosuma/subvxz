00:11.136 --> 00:12.703
Valentine's day was a month ago.

00:12.771 --> 00:14.104
Why are you giving it to me now?

00:14.172 --> 00:16.673
Whatever. Happy
early valentine's day.

00:16.741 --> 00:18.308
I saw this and I thought of you.

00:18.375 --> 00:20.994
Hope you keep that
somewhere special.

00:21.062 --> 00:23.626
Okay, this is one of those
nanny cam teddy bears, isn't it?

00:23.694 --> 00:25.044
What? No!

00:25.111 --> 00:27.018
It's a regular
camera-less teddy bear.

00:27.086 --> 00:29.623
Just put it in your droom,
don't even think about it.

00:29.691 --> 00:31.024
[scoffs]

00:31.091 --> 00:34.161
It's a robot bear.
It's programmed to snuggle.

00:34.229 --> 00:35.496
I'll take it.

00:35.563 --> 00:37.130
Donna, there's a camera in it.

00:37.198 --> 00:39.898
I know.

00:39.965 --> 00:42.867
[triumphant music]

00:42.935 --> 00:52.980
<font color="#ffff00">Sync by honeybunny</font>
<font color="#ffff00">www.addic7ed.com</font>

01:00.552 --> 01:01.916
All right, that's basically it.

01:01.984 --> 01:03.618
Water the plants, get the mail--

01:03.685 --> 01:04.650
Can I read your mail?

01:04.718 --> 01:05.852
No, please don't.

01:05.919 --> 01:07.385
Fine.

01:07.453 --> 01:08.485
Oh, and, um...

01:08.553 --> 01:10.485
Here are the keys, and remember--

01:10.553 --> 01:12.720
I know, don't let
tom make a copy.

01:12.788 --> 01:14.321
That's right, good.

01:14.389 --> 01:17.523
I'm paying April 50 bucks to
watch my house while I'm away.

01:17.591 --> 01:18.891
I would have asked leslie,

01:18.959 --> 01:22.160
But I've seen the way she
takes care of her house.

01:22.228 --> 01:23.728
Plus, there's always been

01:23.795 --> 01:25.930
A little distance
between me and April.

01:25.998 --> 01:27.732
And I thought this would maybe,
I don't know,

01:27.800 --> 01:30.133
Give us a chance to
get a little closer,

01:30.201 --> 01:31.234
Maybe even--

01:31.301 --> 01:32.435
I don't like ann.

01:32.502 --> 01:34.035
Become friends.

01:34.103 --> 01:35.403
Who knows?

01:35.471 --> 01:38.805
Leslie, this is evelyn rowshlind

01:38.873 --> 01:40.006
From the mayor's office.

01:40.074 --> 01:42.341
Oh, hello,
I've always dreamed of you.

01:42.409 --> 01:44.143
- Excuse me?
- Meeting you.

01:44.210 --> 01:45.477
What can I do for you? Have a seat.

01:45.545 --> 01:47.245
- Uh, I prefer to stand.
- Okay.

01:47.313 --> 01:49.113
I have kind of an
odd favor to ask.

01:49.180 --> 01:50.947
Mayor gunderson was
playing golf last week

01:51.015 --> 01:53.482
At pawnee municipal,
and he brought his dog--

01:53.550 --> 01:54.683
Rufus.

01:54.751 --> 01:56.385
We all know rufus.
Everybody loves rufus.

01:56.452 --> 01:58.019
He's a great dog. Continue.

01:58.087 --> 02:00.154
Well, uh, they were
out on the sixth hole

02:00.222 --> 02:01.522
When suddenly, out of nowhere--

02:01.589 --> 02:02.922
Rufus was bitten by a possum?

02:02.990 --> 02:04.691
Yes, how did you know that?

02:04.758 --> 02:07.026
[sigh] it was fairway frank.

02:07.094 --> 02:09.628
Fairway frank is this awful possum

02:09.697 --> 02:11.965
Who lives near the sixth hole
of the public golf course.

02:12.033 --> 02:14.201
And he's actually number three
on the parks department's

02:14.269 --> 02:15.769
Most wanted pests list.

02:15.837 --> 02:18.738
Right behind the bats who like
to poop on the bell tower,

02:18.806 --> 02:20.673
And poopy, the raccoon who poops

02:20.740 --> 02:22.207
All over the high school cafeteria.

02:22.274 --> 02:24.474
Shouldn't you take this
up with animal control?

02:24.542 --> 02:26.403
Let's be honest,
animal control is not

02:26.470 --> 02:28.371
The most effective
branch of our government.

02:28.439 --> 02:29.839
They're a bunch of
burned-out morons.

02:29.907 --> 02:31.173
Well, you have the reputation

02:31.241 --> 02:32.641
As a person who gets things done.

02:32.709 --> 02:35.544
So we'd like you to form
a little task force,

02:35.612 --> 02:37.179
Find the animal, and t it down.

02:37.247 --> 02:38.180
Task force?

02:38.248 --> 02:39.414
Needless to say,

02:39.482 --> 02:40.715
The mayor will be very
grateful for your help.

02:40.783 --> 02:43.017
Ma'am, the next time we speak,

02:43.085 --> 02:45.552
We shall be dancing on
the grave of a possum.

02:45.620 --> 02:46.920
Great.

02:46.988 --> 02:48.455
Ron will show you around.

02:48.522 --> 02:52.292
Um, right this way is the exit.

02:52.359 --> 02:53.559
Yo, police.

02:53.627 --> 02:55.493
Ah, ha ha, no, you're not.

02:55.561 --> 02:56.561
Coffee? [gasp]

02:56.628 --> 02:57.628
Yup.

02:57.696 --> 02:58.995
You always know what to bring me.

02:59.063 --> 03:00.829
I only ever bring you coffee.

03:00.897 --> 03:04.965
And it is my very favorite
non-alcoholic hot drink,

03:05.033 --> 03:06.667
Except for hot tea.

03:06.735 --> 03:09.135
And hot orange juice,
weirdly delicious.

03:09.203 --> 03:11.070
Anyways, thank you so much.
I needed it.

03:11.138 --> 03:13.573
I got a really bad case
of shoe shine head today.

03:13.640 --> 03:15.741
Andy recently diagnosed himself

03:15.809 --> 03:18.977
With what he calls "
shoe shine head."

03:19.045 --> 03:21.245
It's when you shine too many shoes

03:21.313 --> 03:23.080
And the fumes create

03:23.148 --> 03:25.582
A thunderstorm in your brain.

03:25.650 --> 03:30.184
Cures include coffee,
cheeseburgers,

03:30.252 --> 03:33.254
And napping on the floor.

03:33.321 --> 03:36.156
Mark brendanawicz.

03:36.224 --> 03:37.490
Hey, ron. What's up?

03:37.558 --> 03:40.393
I have a wood shop

03:40.460 --> 03:42.194
And I'm planning a
little expansion.

03:42.262 --> 03:44.162
Need my buddy mark,
the city planner,

03:44.230 --> 03:46.531
To sign off on the plans.

03:46.598 --> 03:48.532
Sure, I just need to
schedule an inspection.

03:48.600 --> 03:50.066
That's not really necessary.

03:50.134 --> 03:51.401
Yes, it is, but you'll be fine

03:51.469 --> 03:53.869
As long as you don't
have any code violations.

03:53.937 --> 03:58.139
You don't have any code
violations, do you?

04:02.210 --> 04:03.676
Nope.

04:05.178 --> 04:06.278
[kcking on door]

04:06.345 --> 04:07.779
Eugene!

04:07.847 --> 04:09.781
Boy, we have a really
important job for you.

04:09.848 --> 04:11.449
We'll get to it
first thing Monday.

04:11.517 --> 04:13.049
Today's Wednesday.

04:13.117 --> 04:14.818
Look, this is not a request.

04:14.885 --> 04:16.285
We're acting under direct orders

04:16.353 --> 04:17.386
From mayor gunderson's dog.

04:17.454 --> 04:18.487
Office.

04:18.555 --> 04:20.589
I need your two
best guys to join me

04:20.656 --> 04:21.889
And be part of my task force.

04:21.957 --> 04:24.824
That would be harris and brett.

04:24.892 --> 04:26.993
But they're not here.

04:27.060 --> 04:28.294
Isn't that them there?

04:28.362 --> 04:29.295
Nope.

04:29.363 --> 04:30.329
Hey, brett.

04:30.397 --> 04:31.731
- Yeah.
- Dude!

04:31.798 --> 04:34.800
Listen, that stupid possum
is on the golf course again.

04:34.868 --> 04:36.235
Would you rather I
capture it myself

04:36.302 --> 04:37.803
And then just call you so
you can come and pick it up?

04:37.871 --> 04:38.871
Okay.

04:38.938 --> 04:40.672
[sighs]

04:40.740 --> 04:41.840
Hey, guys.

04:41.908 --> 04:43.241
Aw, cool! Hey,
you want your ball back?

04:43.309 --> 04:45.710
Want your ball back? Come with me.

04:45.777 --> 04:47.944
Aw, man.

04:48.012 --> 04:50.012
How you know my name, homie?

04:50.080 --> 04:51.514
- Stop, man.
- Stop hanging yourself.

04:51.581 --> 04:52.681
I'm gonna hang yourself.

04:52.749 --> 04:53.983
Stop hanging yourself.

04:54.050 --> 04:56.051
Quite a crack team
you've assembled, leslie.

04:56.119 --> 04:57.686
Yeah, well there's five
of us and only one possum.

04:57.754 --> 04:58.820
How hard can it be?

04:58.888 --> 05:01.256
Excuse us,
task force coming through.

05:02.759 --> 05:04.826
Task force clear, resume golfing.

05:04.894 --> 05:06.661
I used to love tiger woods

05:06.729 --> 05:08.294
Because he was a great champion.

05:08.362 --> 05:11.795
But after that sex scandal,
the man is a god.

05:13.431 --> 05:14.998
[knocking on door]

05:15.066 --> 05:17.900
Hey, mark. Welcome to my haven.

05:17.968 --> 05:19.101
Thank you.

05:19.169 --> 05:20.636
You're the first
non-me to set foot

05:20.704 --> 05:22.171
In this building in ten years.

05:22.238 --> 05:25.373
Um, ron, none of
this is up to code.

05:25.441 --> 05:28.875
Sure it is.
It's up to the swanson code.

05:28.943 --> 05:30.010
There's no drainage,

05:30.078 --> 05:31.711
Doesn't seem to be any ventilation,

05:31.779 --> 05:34.114
You've got hazardous
chemicals over here.

05:34.181 --> 05:35.782
Yeah, which only I am breathing.

05:35.850 --> 05:37.216
It's the same liberty that gives me

05:37.284 --> 05:39.018
The right to fart in my own car.

05:39.086 --> 05:40.619
Are you gonna tell a man

05:40.687 --> 05:42.254
That he can't fart in his own car?

05:42.322 --> 05:44.522
There is a basket
of oil-soaked rags

05:44.590 --> 05:47.091
Above a wood burning stove.

05:47.159 --> 05:48.860
Oh, good thing I've
got a fire extinguisher.

05:48.927 --> 05:50.428
Which, I can assure you,

05:50.496 --> 05:53.497
Is totally up to
your precious code.

05:53.565 --> 05:59.035
Um, this says it should
be recharged June of 1996.

05:59.103 --> 06:00.670
Those dates are arbitrary.

06:00.738 --> 06:02.938
They're like those expiration
dates that t government

06:03.006 --> 06:05.807
Forces companies to put
on yogurt and medicine.

06:05.875 --> 06:07.542
Observe. Watch yourself.

06:07.609 --> 06:09.276
Yeah.

06:12.245 --> 06:14.613
Okay, I'll replace this.

06:14.681 --> 06:15.747
Happy?

06:15.815 --> 06:17.382
How long do you think

06:17.450 --> 06:18.783
It would take me to
learn golf, leslie?

06:18.851 --> 06:21.220
I could teach you.
I have a 16 handicap.

06:21.287 --> 06:22.488
But you know,
it takes a lot of practice.

06:22.556 --> 06:24.125
You have to get up early,
hit the range,

06:24.193 --> 06:25.228
Practice reading greens.

06:25.295 --> 06:26.729
See, I don't wanna do all that.

06:26.796 --> 06:28.797
I think I just want some
of those dope pants.

06:28.865 --> 06:30.766
[gasps] oh my god!

06:30.834 --> 06:32.034
Oh, my god, it's fairway frank!

06:32.101 --> 06:34.436
Wow, okay, um... All right, tom?

06:34.504 --> 06:36.438
I want you to very slowly--

06:42.578 --> 06:46.279
25, 26, 27, 28 violations.

06:46.347 --> 06:49.514
Come on, brendanawicz. Relax.

06:49.582 --> 06:52.149
Let me make you a canoe.

06:52.217 --> 06:53.851
Uh, well,
I don't need a canoe, ron.

06:53.918 --> 06:56.353
I need you to fix this place up.

06:56.420 --> 06:59.690
So... I'll give you 24 hours.

07:01.000 --> 07:07.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

07:09.665 --> 07:13.100
Okay, we may only get one
chance to catch this thing,

07:13.168 --> 07:14.568
So we have to play it smart.

07:14.636 --> 07:16.603
You two flank the left,
I'll flank the right,

07:16.671 --> 07:17.804
Andy will come in through--

07:17.871 --> 07:21.708
[screaming]

07:21.775 --> 07:24.777
Andy! - I got it.

07:24.845 --> 07:25.778
Oh, my--

07:25.846 --> 07:26.779
Ha ha! I got him.

07:26.847 --> 07:27.781
Task force! Engage!

07:27.849 --> 07:28.782
- He's got it.
- I got him.

07:28.850 --> 07:29.783
He's good.

07:29.851 --> 07:31.117
Come on, you cowards!

07:31.185 --> 07:33.052
Lemme see his face.
Lemme see his face.

07:33.120 --> 07:34.487
It's him! It's him, we got him!

07:34.555 --> 07:36.088
It's okay. He's on my neck.

07:36.156 --> 07:37.556
- Okay, okay, okay, okay!
- He's on my neck.

07:37.591 --> 07:38.857
It's all right, it's all right,
it's all right.

07:38.925 --> 07:40.159
- He's on my neck.
- All right, it's okay.

07:40.226 --> 07:42.060
You're next, poopy.

07:42.128 --> 07:43.595
Very impressive, leslie.

07:43.663 --> 07:45.497
Aw, thank you.
I had a great task force.

07:45.565 --> 07:47.399
I was just the simple mastermind

07:47.466 --> 07:48.433
Who planned the whole operation

07:48.500 --> 07:49.867
And executed it to perfection.

07:49.935 --> 07:52.503
This is andy dwyer.
He actually caught the thing.

07:52.570 --> 07:54.137
- Mr. Dwyer--
- please...

07:54.205 --> 07:56.673
My friends call me andy radical.

07:56.741 --> 07:58.073
No, we don't.

07:58.141 --> 08:01.143
By day, andy dwyer,
shoeshine-ist.

08:01.211 --> 08:04.680
By different time of day,
andy radical, possum tackler.

08:04.747 --> 08:07.181
And by night...

08:07.249 --> 08:09.148
I do whatever I want, no job.

08:09.216 --> 08:11.650
We think that this is
a great p.R. Opportunity

08:11.718 --> 08:13.719
<i>So we've arranged for a
reporter from the journal</i>

08:13.787 --> 08:16.521
To stop by to interview,
get some pictures of the team.

08:16.589 --> 08:18.056
Task force. Great.

08:18.124 --> 08:19.891
And next time you
need a special favor

08:19.959 --> 08:22.193
From the mayor's office,
give me a call.

08:22.261 --> 08:26.095
Oh, my god, I will.
I need so many special favors.

08:26.163 --> 08:27.463
Which one should I choose?

08:27.530 --> 08:28.797
Well, you don't
have to choose right--

08:28.864 --> 08:29.864
How about an extra recycling can?

08:29.932 --> 08:30.898
No.

08:30.966 --> 08:32.566
Laminated bus pass? No.

08:32.634 --> 08:33.933
What time do you
usually go to sleep?

08:34.001 --> 08:35.501
'cause my best ideas
usually come to me at nit.

08:35.568 --> 08:37.068
Let's stick to
business hours, shall we?

08:37.135 --> 08:38.068
Yeah, all right.

08:38.136 --> 08:40.438
See you in hell, buddy.

08:46.610 --> 08:48.643
Am I sure the possum we
caught is fairway frank?

08:48.711 --> 08:49.644
Yes.

08:49.712 --> 08:51.379
Am I quite sure? No.

08:51.447 --> 08:52.980
Am I sure enough? Maybe.

08:53.048 --> 08:54.815
If it wasn't fairway frank,
would I feel badly?

08:54.882 --> 08:55.815
Of course.

08:55.883 --> 08:56.883
Could I live with myself?

08:56.951 --> 08:58.051
That depends.

08:58.118 --> 08:59.852
As a city official it's important

08:59.920 --> 09:01.921
That I ask myself a
lot of questions.

09:01.988 --> 09:03.922
Does doing so help
me make decisions

09:03.990 --> 09:04.923
Uh...

09:07.138 --> 09:08.105
- Oh, hey, shauna.
- Hi, leslie.

09:08.172 --> 09:09.206
Hi!

09:09.273 --> 09:10.640
Andy, you remember
shauna malwae-tweep

09:10.708 --> 09:11.641
<i>From the pawnee journal.</i>

09:11.709 --> 09:12.809
How could I forget?

09:12.877 --> 09:14.043
You wrote the article
when I fell in the pit.

09:14.111 --> 09:15.078
And then afterwards

09:15.145 --> 09:16.112
Had sex with Mark,

09:16.179 --> 09:17.680
And everyone talked about it.

09:21.132 --> 09:24.066
So you're on the golf course,
and you see fairway frank.

09:24.134 --> 09:27.269
Well, we see a possum that
we believe to be fairway frank.

09:27.337 --> 09:29.103
So for right now,
let's just refer to it as

09:29.171 --> 09:30.237
A possum.

09:30.305 --> 09:31.704
Let me explain
something to you, tweep.

09:31.772 --> 09:34.007
When you're in a situation,

09:34.075 --> 09:36.643
You don't have time to think.

09:36.710 --> 09:39.945
So I thought to myself,

09:40.013 --> 09:42.380
"don't think, andy. Act."

09:42.448 --> 09:44.483
So you weren't thinking.

09:44.551 --> 09:46.418
Not at all.

09:46.486 --> 09:49.321
I cannot emphasize enough
how little I was thinking.

09:49.389 --> 09:50.322
Were you scared?

09:50.390 --> 09:52.458
No, no, I wasn't.

09:52.526 --> 09:54.726
Well, I, uh, I lived in the pit

09:54.794 --> 09:56.394
For the better part of last year

09:56.462 --> 09:59.897
And made some vermin friends.

09:59.965 --> 10:01.599
Um, you know what?
Friends sounds stupid.

10:01.666 --> 10:03.934
Colleagues.

10:04.001 --> 10:07.069
Uh, they are bad at sharing,

10:07.137 --> 10:09.172
But they are good at tag.

10:09.240 --> 10:11.074
Well, your family
must bvery proud.

10:11.141 --> 10:12.708
What does your girlfriend think?

10:12.776 --> 10:13.709
Uh, the nurse?

10:13.777 --> 10:17.046
Uh, I broke up with ann.

10:17.114 --> 10:18.047
- Hmm.
- Yeah.

10:18.114 --> 10:19.315
Shortly after she kicked me out

10:19.382 --> 10:21.516
And told me we wouldn't
be togeer anymore.

10:21.584 --> 10:26.187
Well, maybe this article
will change her mind.

10:26.255 --> 10:27.755
What now?

10:27.823 --> 10:29.224
I hadn't even thought of that.

10:29.292 --> 10:31.192
[chuckles] wow.

10:31.260 --> 10:34.662
Of all the things I thought
would bring us back together,

10:34.729 --> 10:38.199
Catching a possum was
never on that list.

10:40.068 --> 10:42.669
Well, let's go take some
pictures of fairway frank.

10:42.737 --> 10:44.671
Of the possum.

10:46.506 --> 10:48.707
Seriously, man,
when you wear these clothes,

10:48.775 --> 10:51.209
You just feel better
than everyone else.

10:51.277 --> 10:53.044
You know? - Yeah.

10:53.111 --> 10:54.844
[knocking] busy?

10:54.912 --> 10:56.078
No, what's up?

10:56.145 --> 10:57.845
Ju wanted to tell you,

10:57.912 --> 11:00.679
I understand that city codes exist

11:00.747 --> 11:02.881
And I know why they exist.

11:02.948 --> 11:05.949
And I understand that
you enforce them.

11:06.017 --> 11:07.184
Okay.

11:07.251 --> 11:08.418
Okay, good talk.

11:08.485 --> 11:10.052
Can you sign off on my plans now?

11:10.120 --> 11:13.591
Did you get
everything up to code?

11:19.064 --> 11:20.331
- Yup.
- No, you didn't.

11:20.399 --> 11:22.466
You clearly didn't.

11:22.534 --> 11:24.768
It's my property, my land,

11:24.835 --> 11:26.336
My shop!

11:26.403 --> 11:29.138
Ooh, tummy needs a banana,
you guys good?

11:29.206 --> 11:32.274
Ron, you're asking me to
do a bad job, at my job,

11:32.342 --> 11:34.409
And I'm just not gonna do that.

11:34.476 --> 11:35.577
So if you don't mind,

11:35.644 --> 11:39.080
Would you please just
get out of my office?

11:39.147 --> 11:41.548
Ooh, silly me,
there was this little

11:41.616 --> 11:44.284
Pom-pom on my glove
and it fell off.

11:44.352 --> 11:45.387
Have you seen it?

11:45.454 --> 11:46.454
Could you help me look
for it real quick?

11:46.522 --> 11:47.655
It should be on the
ground somewhere

11:47.723 --> 11:49.423
Where I was puttin' it up.

11:49.491 --> 11:51.158
Let's see.

11:52.194 --> 11:53.194
So how's your hole?

11:53.261 --> 11:54.228
Excuse me?

11:54.296 --> 11:55.662
The pit. Lot 48?

11:55.730 --> 11:57.864
Oh, we're making really
good progress on the park.

11:57.931 --> 12:00.900
In fact, there may be some big
news on that front coming soon.

12:00.968 --> 12:04.971
All because of this very
important business card.

12:05.039 --> 12:06.639
So this isn't really
a big story, right?

12:06.707 --> 12:08.340
Nobody cares about this very much.

12:08.407 --> 12:10.208
Well, fairway frank did
bite the mayor's dog,

12:10.276 --> 12:12.943
So this could be on the front page.

12:13.011 --> 12:15.611
* fairway frank,
you're gonna die *

12:15.679 --> 12:19.248
* you're gonna fry, oh, yeah *

12:19.316 --> 12:23.019
* you guilty son-of-a-bitch *

12:23.087 --> 12:27.623
* you're gonna fry when
they flip that switch *

12:30.159 --> 12:31.159
Hey, April, can I talk to you

12:31.227 --> 12:32.728
About this situation
with the possum?

12:32.796 --> 12:34.029
No.

12:34.097 --> 12:35.631
Okay, hypothetically,
if you were going on a mission

12:35.698 --> 12:37.899
To, say, catch a guilty whale.

12:37.967 --> 12:40.234
And while you were
catching the whale

12:40.302 --> 12:42.870
You saw something else that
may also be another whale,

12:42.937 --> 12:44.171
And you were like, "what?"

12:44.239 --> 12:45.372
But then you thought,
maybe it's not a whale?

12:45.439 --> 12:46.740
Maybe it's a big fish.

12:46.807 --> 12:48.174
Maybe it's a submarine
with a face painted on it.

12:48.242 --> 12:49.175
The point is,

12:49.243 --> 12:50.476
If I kill the first whale,

12:50.543 --> 12:52.077
Am I technically a murderer?

12:52.145 --> 12:53.411
I don't know what
you're talking about.

12:53.479 --> 12:55.679
I saw a second possum.

12:55.747 --> 12:57.880
There was another possum.

12:57.948 --> 13:00.451
Wait, andy's in there
talking to a reporter,

13:00.519 --> 13:02.820
Literally kissing his own biceps.

13:02.887 --> 13:03.854
You're telling me he
might not be a hero,

13:03.921 --> 13:04.988
But just some jerk

13:05.056 --> 13:07.857
That goes around
tackling random possums?

13:07.925 --> 13:09.425
No, I've gotta help
leslie find the truth.

13:09.493 --> 13:12.161
Not because I'm pissed at andy,
which I'm not.

13:12.228 --> 13:16.531
Because I care so
deeply about possums.

13:18.167 --> 13:19.901
'cause they're so adorable.

13:19.969 --> 13:24.171
April, did you
see my photo shoot?

13:24.239 --> 13:25.572
I think I nailed it.

13:25.640 --> 13:27.841
I fell off the stool once when
I was trying to look serious.

13:27.909 --> 13:29.577
But I'm okay.

13:29.645 --> 13:32.079
That's cool, um,
I'm really happy for you.

13:32.147 --> 13:35.648
You are?

13:35.716 --> 13:38.384
Man, our happy reactions
are super different.

13:38.452 --> 13:40.787
So, uh, he said he's gonna email me

13:40.855 --> 13:42.121
The photos in, like, six hours.

13:42.189 --> 13:43.589
You wanna wait with me?

13:43.657 --> 13:45.324
Um, yeah, that sounds good,

13:45.392 --> 13:47.059
But I can't because I have to go

13:47.126 --> 13:48.760
Do something that actually matters.

13:52.999 --> 13:54.266
Fairway frank's been haunting

13:54.334 --> 13:55.600
The sixth hole for a while now.

13:55.667 --> 13:56.600
You must know him pretty well.

13:56.668 --> 13:58.302
I sure do.

13:58.369 --> 13:59.536
I've chased that little sucker off

13:59.604 --> 14:02.405
More times than I can count.

14:02.473 --> 14:04.140
Can you just take a
look at these photos

14:04.208 --> 14:06.842
And make sure that
it's fairway frank?

14:06.910 --> 14:09.644
Yup, that's him.

14:09.712 --> 14:11.812
Mr. Campopiano, those are photos

14:11.880 --> 14:14.714
Of three different possums.

14:14.781 --> 14:16.415
Huh.

14:16.483 --> 14:19.784
You guys want something to drink?

14:19.852 --> 14:21.119
Hey, boss, there's a possum

14:21.187 --> 14:22.887
Wandering around on the 14th green.

14:22.955 --> 14:24.522
Should I call animal control again?

14:24.590 --> 14:26.857
Yup.

14:26.925 --> 14:29.960
Oh, my god, those idiots
are here from animal control.

14:30.028 --> 14:31.094
They're gonna take it away.

14:31.162 --> 14:32.495
Okay, we need a
little bit more time

14:32.563 --> 14:33.530
To figure out the truth.

14:33.597 --> 14:34.564
Look, I have an idea.

14:34.631 --> 14:35.798
I'm gonna distract everybody,

14:35.866 --> 14:37.165
And then you get that
possum out of here.

14:37.233 --> 14:38.199
Can you do that, April?

14:38.267 --> 14:39.200
April, can you do that?

14:39.268 --> 14:40.234
Can you get the possum out of here?

14:40.302 --> 14:41.669
Can you sneak it out of here?

14:41.737 --> 14:42.804
April, can you do it?
Can you do it?

14:42.871 --> 14:43.871
Please, April,
tell me you can do this.

14:43.939 --> 14:46.274
Yes, yes, I can do it. God.

14:46.341 --> 14:48.242
I can't kill the possum
because it might be innocent.

14:48.309 --> 14:51.110
I can't let the possum go
because it might be guilty.

14:51.178 --> 14:53.446
Can't make a good soup,
can't do a handstand in a pool,

14:53.513 --> 14:55.881
Can't spell the word "lieutenant."

14:55.949 --> 14:57.917
There's a lot of "can'ts"
in my life right now.

14:57.984 --> 15:00.018
Let's make it happen, captain.

15:00.086 --> 15:03.522
[harris and brett
chatter indistinctly]

15:06.559 --> 15:08.994
Help, help, my arm
looks like it's bleeding.

15:09.062 --> 15:10.362
Holy cow--leslie!

15:10.430 --> 15:11.530
Oh, boy, oh,
look how much it's bleeding.

15:11.598 --> 15:12.664
Everybody look at it.

15:12.732 --> 15:14.432
Everybody look over here.

15:14.500 --> 15:16.167
I need everyone's full
attention during this--

15:16.235 --> 15:17.168
There's a lot of blood.

15:17.236 --> 15:18.169
It is, it's so--

15:18.237 --> 15:19.670
It's ketchup.

15:19.738 --> 15:21.872
Is it?

15:21.939 --> 15:22.906
Yes.

15:22.973 --> 15:24.640
- Jerry, jerry.
- It's ketchup.

15:32.411 --> 15:34.779
Do you know them?

15:34.847 --> 15:37.482
What do you mean,
that fairway frank is not here?

15:37.549 --> 15:38.949
Here's the thing, evelyn.

15:39.017 --> 15:40.818
We're not sure that the possum

15:40.886 --> 15:43.053
We caught is, in fact,
fairway frank.

15:43.121 --> 15:46.321
Leslie, whoever it is,
it's a possum.

15:46.389 --> 15:48.457
And the sooner it's dead,
the sooner the mayor

15:48.524 --> 15:51.258
Can do what he wants with it.

15:51.326 --> 15:53.960
Does he want to have
sex with a dead possum?

15:54.028 --> 15:55.528
- No!
- No.

15:55.596 --> 15:57.097
He's not a monster.

15:57.165 --> 16:00.033
He wants to stuff it and
hang it above the urinal

16:00.101 --> 16:02.268
In his office bathroom so
that little flecks of pee

16:02.336 --> 16:04.470
Can get on it forever.

16:04.537 --> 16:05.671
Eww.

16:05.739 --> 16:08.640
Now, leslie, you did a great job.

16:08.708 --> 16:12.043
And the mayor knows that
you did a great job.

16:12.111 --> 16:13.712
Now where is the possum?

16:13.780 --> 16:17.582
I'm sorry but he's somewhere.
You'll never find it.

16:17.650 --> 16:19.851
And he's gonna stay there
until the truth comes out.

16:19.918 --> 16:21.853
And I will not reveal his location,

16:21.920 --> 16:23.354
No matter how much you ask me.

16:23.421 --> 16:24.788
But I'm gonna stop talking
now 'cause I'm afraid

16:24.856 --> 16:25.989
I may accidentally say where it is.

16:26.057 --> 16:28.325
So please go.

16:32.870 --> 16:33.503
This is interesting.

16:33.571 --> 16:35.472
They put down a raccoon

16:35.539 --> 16:38.474
That bit a jogger in a
park in staten island.

16:38.542 --> 16:39.742
Wow.

16:39.810 --> 16:41.277
And in walnut creek, california,

16:41.345 --> 16:43.512
They put down a
duck that bit a kid.

16:43.580 --> 16:46.181
But security footage later revealed

16:46.249 --> 16:49.185
That it was actually a goose.

16:49.252 --> 16:51.487
- That's great.
- No, it's awful, tom.

16:51.554 --> 16:53.589
How would you feel if you
killed an innocent duck

16:53.656 --> 16:56.091
And let a vicious
goose waddle free?

16:56.158 --> 16:57.525
[phone ringing]

16:57.593 --> 16:59.327
- Tom haverford.
- Tom, it's April.

16:59.394 --> 17:01.361
I'm at ann's house and
the possum's loose, okay?

17:01.429 --> 17:02.562
I need your help.

17:02.630 --> 17:03.663
Oh, my god, it's
chewing on everything!

17:03.731 --> 17:04.696
Don't tell leslie!

17:04.765 --> 17:07.233
You got it.

17:07.300 --> 17:09.101
Possum got loose at ann's house.

17:09.169 --> 17:10.469
Oh, my god.

17:10.537 --> 17:12.739
April! April, it's leslie knope

17:12.807 --> 17:14.108
From the parks department!

17:14.175 --> 17:15.808
Stop ringing the doorbell.
It's making him mad!

17:15.876 --> 17:17.276
[knocking]

17:17.344 --> 17:18.377
Oh!

17:18.444 --> 17:20.246
Oh, my god, how did this happen?

17:20.314 --> 17:22.415
I let it out of its cage
because it needed water

17:22.482 --> 17:24.083
And I thought it would just
drink out of the toilet

17:24.150 --> 17:25.250
Or something, but then it ran off

17:25.318 --> 17:27.885
And I couldn't get it back in.

17:27.953 --> 17:29.619
He did that too.

17:29.687 --> 17:30.653
Oh...Oh boy.

17:30.721 --> 17:31.854
Yeah, and then I
opened all the doors

17:31.921 --> 17:33.454
'cause I thought it
would just go outside,

17:33.522 --> 17:34.755
But it won't leave the house.

17:34.823 --> 17:36.489
It must love tacky
pictures of flowers.

17:36.557 --> 17:37.790
Okay, okay, okay,
I'm gonna fix this.

17:37.858 --> 17:39.792
Um, let me just think for a second.

17:39.860 --> 17:41.492
- Uh-oh.
- What?

17:41.560 --> 17:42.492
Where is it? I can't see it!

17:42.560 --> 17:43.693
No! Okay, where did it go?

17:43.760 --> 17:45.494
- I don't know!
- Um, here's what we do.

17:45.562 --> 17:46.561
We just go outside, all right?

17:46.629 --> 17:47.562
Let's just go outside--

17:47.630 --> 17:50.865
[screaming] - get in here!

17:54.637 --> 17:58.507
[lengthy groan]

17:58.574 --> 17:59.842
[knock on door]

17:59.909 --> 18:02.877
I haven't even started yet.

18:02.945 --> 18:04.045
I know.

18:04.112 --> 18:06.713
I thought you could use some help.

18:06.781 --> 18:08.448
Those city planning guys can
be real pains in the ass.

18:08.515 --> 18:10.549
You know what I'm sayin'?

18:10.617 --> 18:12.284
Okay.

18:12.351 --> 18:13.818
I just want you to know

18:13.886 --> 18:15.619
That I still don't
think city codes--

18:15.687 --> 18:18.655
Ron, shut up, would you please?

18:18.723 --> 18:21.358
I'm taking a half day off
to come and help you out

18:21.426 --> 18:23.059
Because you're my friend.

18:23.127 --> 18:26.062
So just shut up.

18:26.130 --> 18:29.999
No, I'm bringing my workshop
up to the swanson code.

18:30.066 --> 18:33.101
And if the swanson
code happens to overlap

18:33.168 --> 18:35.636
With the city government code--

18:35.704 --> 18:38.238
Shut up!

18:38.306 --> 18:40.941
I know there's a door there,
but I kind of feel like

18:41.008 --> 18:42.309
It's gonna chew through the door

18:42.377 --> 18:43.944
And come and jump on
my face and bite me.

18:44.011 --> 18:45.645
- Eww, I know.
- What if it's in here?

18:45.713 --> 18:46.746
What if it laid eggs in the bed?

18:46.814 --> 18:48.214
[both scream]

18:48.281 --> 18:49.248
Okay, there are no eggs.

18:49.316 --> 18:50.549
We should have killed it,

18:50.617 --> 18:51.984
It's so huge. I'm gonna call andy.

18:52.052 --> 18:53.218
- No.
- Yeah.

18:53.286 --> 18:54.420
He tackled it once before.

18:54.487 --> 18:55.420
He can do it again.

18:55.488 --> 18:56.455
No, please don't, okay?

18:56.522 --> 18:57.789
He's gonna be pissed at me.

18:57.857 --> 19:00.192
I already ruined his big day,
and it's my fault

19:00.259 --> 19:01.926
That it's in ann's house,
who he's obviously

19:01.994 --> 19:03.693
Still in love with.

19:03.761 --> 19:04.894
I just--

19:04.962 --> 19:10.097
I don't want him to
be mad at me, okay?

19:10.165 --> 19:14.101
Oh, April. He'll forgive you.

19:14.169 --> 19:15.436
You think so?

19:15.504 --> 19:17.338
Yeah. I--

19:17.406 --> 19:18.973
We don't have to call andy.

19:19.041 --> 19:20.841
We can just call animal control.

19:20.909 --> 19:23.544
Okay.

19:23.612 --> 19:26.613
And, April, anytime you
want to talk about boys--

19:26.681 --> 19:29.715
Oh my god, stop. [both scream]

19:43.158 --> 19:46.527
[phone ringing]

19:48.896 --> 19:50.497
Yo.

19:50.564 --> 19:52.164
So I feel like you were
mad at me yesterday,

19:52.232 --> 19:53.332
And I don't know why.

19:53.400 --> 19:55.501
So I made a list
of everything I did

19:55.569 --> 19:57.903
And I'm gonna try not
to do any of them again.

19:57.971 --> 20:02.939
Also, I got you this coffee.

20:03.007 --> 20:04.507
And then there's this.

20:04.574 --> 20:06.008
Fourth paragraph down.

20:06.075 --> 20:08.009
"but dwyer had some help
catching the possum.

20:08.077 --> 20:10.044
"'I wouldn't have been able to
do it without an early morning

20:10.111 --> 20:12.278
"'caffeine boost from the
amazing April ludgate.

20:12.345 --> 20:14.312
"'she gave me the
liquid courage I needed

20:14.380 --> 20:17.948
To wrestle that beast
to the ground.'"

20:18.016 --> 20:19.817
Well, ms. Knope, I have to say

20:19.884 --> 20:21.352
I'm very disappointed.

20:21.420 --> 20:22.921
You didn't have to say that.

20:22.988 --> 20:23.989
You could have just thought it.

20:24.057 --> 20:26.758
What'd you do with
the possum exactly?

20:26.826 --> 20:29.328
Well, I'm proud to
say that it's somewhere

20:29.396 --> 20:31.530
The mayor can never pee on it.

20:31.598 --> 20:33.098
It's okay, honestly.

20:33.166 --> 20:35.400
I mean, look, when I retire,

20:35.468 --> 20:37.869
And I'm attending some gala

20:37.937 --> 20:40.905
Honoring the first three
female presidents in history--

20:40.972 --> 20:44.141
Myself, and two other
women I've inspired--

20:44.209 --> 20:46.576
I wanna be looking back at
my distinguished legacy,

20:46.644 --> 20:50.312
And not thinking that I owe
my career to some possum.

20:50.380 --> 20:52.747
And I wanna be wearing a huge,
beautiful blue hat.

20:54.054 --> 20:55.721
- Thank you so much.
- Sure.

20:56.429 --> 20:57.996
It made me feel so happy
that I knew somebody was here

20:58.064 --> 20:59.398
Taking care of my house.

20:59.465 --> 21:00.566
Cool.

21:00.633 --> 21:01.834
So did the neighbors
give you any problems?

21:01.901 --> 21:03.202
- No.
- Anything in--

21:03.270 --> 21:05.004
Possum. There was a possum.

21:05.071 --> 21:06.906
We captured a possum and we
brought it into your house

21:06.973 --> 21:08.973
And it got out and it might
have laid eggs in your bed.

21:09.040 --> 21:10.373
What?

21:10.441 --> 21:11.841
And it went into your
laundry and your kitchen

21:11.909 --> 21:13.576
And it touched all your bras,
and I'm so sorry.

21:13.644 --> 21:15.277
It's our fault, we captured it,
and it got out

21:15.345 --> 21:16.779
And it ran around
and it was a possum.

21:16.846 --> 21:18.079
Okay, April-- run! Run, April!

21:18.147 --> 21:19.881
Sorry, ann! I love you!

21:21.149 --> 21:22.950
I'm gonna go.

21:23.017 --> 21:24.785
I think that would be best.
