<i>What's out there, out
in the great beyond?</i>

00:55.035 --> 00:57.417
<i>And what's beyond that?</i>

00:57.452 --> 00:59.765
<i>What's beyond beyond?</i>

00:59.800 --> 01:02.765
<i>The answer is: I don't know.</i>

01:02.800 --> 01:05.400
<i>And quite frankly, I don't want to know,</i>

01:05.435 --> 01:07.967
<i>because what I do
know is that they don't</i>

01:08.002 --> 01:10.465
<i>hold a candle to the greatest town</i>

01:10.500 --> 01:13.800
<i>in the greatest country
on the greatest planet</i>

01:13.835 --> 01:16.167
<i>in the whole universe.</i>

01:16.202 --> 01:18.500
<i>Glenview, Ohio.</i>

01:18.535 --> 01:20.265
<i>USA.</i>

01:20.300 --> 01:21.100
<i>Earth.</i>

01:23.100 --> 01:25.765
<i>Here in Glenview, we value diversity.</i>

01:25.800 --> 01:29.700
<i>I myself am friends with
an Indian man named Clyde.</i>

01:29.735 --> 01:32.600
<i>And Mrs. Kim, a wonderful
widow from Korea.</i>

01:32.635 --> 01:34.165
Hey, Mrs. Kim.

01:34.200 --> 01:36.500
Spray me. Spray me, neighbor.

01:37.800 --> 01:39.350
Sun shower.

01:39.385 --> 01:40.865
Fun shower!

01:40.900 --> 01:43.100
<i>I don't have any black friends yet,</i>

01:43.135 --> 01:44.517
<i>but I am on the market.</i>

01:44.552 --> 01:45.900
My name's Evan Trautwig.

01:45.935 --> 01:47.065
Oh. Ed Bosani.

01:47.100 --> 01:48.365
<i>Every day, I ask</i>

01:48.400 --> 01:49.850
<i>not what Glenview can do for me;</i>

01:49.885 --> 01:51.092
<i>What can I do for Glenview?</i>

01:51.127 --> 01:52.363
Oh, geez, Jared, your glutes

01:52.398 --> 01:53.565
are tighter than a snare drum.

01:53.600 --> 01:56.265
<i>That's why I founded the running club,</i>

01:56.300 --> 01:58.300
<i>the Spanish table at
the community center...</i>

02:00.702 --> 02:02.965
<i>And created the position</i>

02:03.000 --> 02:05.200
<i>of deputy secretary at the city council.</i>

02:05.235 --> 02:06.765
All right, next item on the agenda

02:06.800 --> 02:09.100
stipulates curb height
for wheelchair access

02:09.134 --> 02:11.100
be no more than six inches in height.

02:11.135 --> 02:12.565
Now, I know this is a hot topic,

02:12.600 --> 02:14.950
so I will defer to the commissioner.

02:14.985 --> 02:17.265
<i>Here, dreams really do come true.</i>

02:17.300 --> 02:20.700
<i>A simple man can start out
as a junior manager at Costco,</i>

02:20.735 --> 02:23.265
<i>and 12 years later, with
hard work and gumption,</i>

02:23.300 --> 02:27.200
<i>end up the senior manager
at that very same Costco.</i>

02:27.235 --> 02:30.000
<i>I should know, because that man's name</i>

02:30.035 --> 02:31.865
<i>is me.</i>

02:31.900 --> 02:33.300
I don't mean to bust
your chops here, kid,

02:33.335 --> 02:35.065
but this is total bullshit.

02:35.100 --> 02:37.000
Those rats are as flat
as they ever have been.

02:37.035 --> 02:38.400
I'm sorry. It really should be working.

02:38.435 --> 02:39.565
Excuse me, sir, if I might.

02:39.600 --> 02:41.500
The activation button is right there.

02:41.535 --> 02:42.765
Holy shit.

02:42.800 --> 02:44.400
This is incredible.

02:44.435 --> 02:45.765
Yeah.

02:45.800 --> 02:48.100
There's chipmunks all
coming out of the TV, Costco!

02:48.200 --> 02:49.050
Look, the whole gang's here.

02:49.085 --> 02:49.865
Yeah. Yeah, it's a great set.

02:49.900 --> 02:52.864
Full HD, 1080p, 240 hertz, TrueMotion.

02:52.865 --> 02:52.865
Totally wireless...

02:52.900 --> 02:54.850
Hey, hey, hey, buddy, please.

02:54.885 --> 02:56.800
This is a miracle of technology.

02:56.835 --> 02:58.165
This is incredible.

02:58.200 --> 02:59.665
Where do I pay for this baby?

02:59.700 --> 03:01.300
Justin will load you up.
Go to front-end checkout.

03:01.335 --> 03:02.300
- You're a beauty.
- Okay.

03:02.335 --> 03:03.864
Thank you, switch man.

03:03.865 --> 03:03.865
All right.

03:03.900 --> 03:04.898
Turning the switch on!

03:04.899 --> 03:06.365
Turning on a whole new world for me.

03:06.400 --> 03:09.100
Hey, Justin, if we stop
by some free food samples,

03:09.135 --> 03:10.300
I'm not gonna be pissed, either.

03:12.300 --> 03:13.565
<i>But you know what?</i>

03:13.600 --> 03:15.600
<i>It's not all about work.</i>

03:15.635 --> 03:17.565
<i>I've had a lot of fun</i>

03:17.600 --> 03:21.500
<i>and formed friendships
that will last a lifetime.</i>

03:24.200 --> 03:26.400
Hey, there he is.

03:27.365 --> 03:27.365
So?

03:27.400 --> 03:29.350
There are 50 stars

03:29.385 --> 03:31.265
on the American flag,

03:31.300 --> 03:34.500
the Constitution was written in 1787,

03:34.535 --> 03:35.565
and...

03:35.600 --> 03:37.800
I am now an American citizen.

03:38.900 --> 03:39.600
Really?

03:39.635 --> 03:40.417
Yes.

03:41.200 --> 03:42.900
Antonio, that's great.

03:42.935 --> 03:44.565
I knew it. I knew it.

03:44.600 --> 03:46.400
You see, good things
happen to good people,

03:46.435 --> 03:48.317
and you are a good man.

03:48.352 --> 03:50.165
Oh. And look, boss.

03:50.200 --> 03:52.000
I got a new tattoo to celebrate.

03:52.752 --> 03:53.676
Yeah.

03:54.600 --> 03:56.264
That's really fresh, isn't it?

03:56.265 --> 03:56.265
Yeah.

03:56.300 --> 03:57.365
"Proud to be an American."

03:57.400 --> 03:58.765
Good. Maybe keep it covered, though,

03:58.800 --> 04:00.900
just 'cause it's not
really Costco policy, okay?

04:00.935 --> 04:02.067
Yes, of course, boss.

04:02.102 --> 04:03.151
I'm proud of you.

04:03.186 --> 04:04.165
This is great.

04:04.200 --> 04:06.100
All right, I got to get out of here.

04:06.065 --> 04:06.065
Okay.

04:06.100 --> 04:08.165
Oh, hey, listen.

04:08.200 --> 04:10.200
If a bag of Bugles
and a six-pack of Coke

04:10.235 --> 04:11.700
go missing, it's on me.

04:11.735 --> 04:13.367
You earned it.

04:13.402 --> 04:15.201
Thanks, boss.

Mr. Trautwig.

05:41.135 --> 05:43.300
Is that you?

05:56.200 --> 05:58.800
Who's there?

06:04.900 --> 06:06.300
Okay.

06:15.400 --> 06:18.800
What the fuck?

06:21.800 --> 06:23.465
Listen!

06:23.500 --> 06:25.765
They gave me a gun, okay?

06:25.800 --> 06:29.200
And they didn't teach
me to use it properly.

06:29.235 --> 06:32.265
So... you're in a lot of danger

06:32.300 --> 06:36.100
if you don't just
back the fuck up, okay?

06:38.100 --> 06:39.950
Oh, no!

06:39.985 --> 06:41.800
No!

06:43.400 --> 06:45.700
Oh, no, no...!

07:08.600 --> 07:10.165
<i>It's just a baby shower, hon.</i>

07:10.200 --> 07:12.800
<i>I don't know why you're so
excited about going there</i>

07:12.835 --> 07:14.617
when everything is so great here.

07:14.652 --> 07:16.376
We used to hate New York together.

07:16.411 --> 07:18.100
It was, like, one of our things.

07:18.135 --> 07:19.865
It is great here, Evan.

07:19.900 --> 07:21.800
I love it. It's just a little boring.

07:21.835 --> 07:23.617
Actually, it's super boring.

07:23.652 --> 07:25.426
I just... I want to get out

07:25.461 --> 07:27.080
and see the world a little bit.

07:27.115 --> 07:28.665
You know, get some culture,

07:28.700 --> 07:30.900
eat some good food, go to a few museums.

07:30.935 --> 07:32.665
We have museums here.

07:32.700 --> 07:35.000
All right, I think we're
still a couple days away,

07:35.035 --> 07:36.300
but when I get back...

07:36.265 --> 07:36.265
Yeah?

07:36.300 --> 07:38.400
I'm going to walk through that door,

07:38.435 --> 07:41.900
and we are going to S-C-R-E-W.

07:41.935 --> 07:43.065
Okay, okay.

07:43.100 --> 07:44.565
Right on the kitchen floor.

07:44.600 --> 07:46.300
I love it when you spell it.

07:46.335 --> 07:47.365
Definitely.

07:47.400 --> 07:49.300
Or we could do it in the bedroom.

07:49.335 --> 07:50.217
Thank you. Okay.

07:50.252 --> 07:51.065
Or we could...

07:51.100 --> 07:53.900
start in the kitchen, then
move up to the bedroom.

07:53.935 --> 07:55.065
Bye.

07:55.100 --> 07:57.000
Have fun.

07:57.035 --> 07:58.467
Be safe.

07:58.502 --> 07:59.900
I love you.

08:04.900 --> 08:07.800
What is going on?

08:21.300 --> 08:22.965
Sorry, sir.

08:23.000 --> 08:24.050
Can't let you in there.

08:24.085 --> 08:25.065
No, no, no, it's okay.

08:25.100 --> 08:26.850
I'm the manager. This is my store.

08:26.885 --> 08:28.565
Well, I'm afraid your store is closed

08:28.600 --> 08:30.600
- until further notice.
- What are you talking about?

08:30.635 --> 08:32.500
I can't divulge that, sir.

08:32.534 --> 08:34.267
Police policy.

08:34.302 --> 08:35.965
Oh, wait a second.

08:36.000 --> 08:38.100
You're the manager, so
do you happen to know

08:38.135 --> 08:40.200
the name of the guy who
was working last night?

08:40.235 --> 08:41.717
Yes... Antonio.

08:41.751 --> 08:43.200
Antonio Guzman.

08:43.235 --> 08:44.365
Antonio...

08:44.400 --> 08:46.000
Why? Did something happen to him?

08:46.035 --> 08:48.165
Guz... man.

08:48.200 --> 08:50.000
Yeah, he's dead.

08:51.000 --> 08:52.165
What?

08:52.200 --> 08:54.800
Are... are you sure?

08:54.835 --> 08:56.165
Pretty sure.

08:56.200 --> 08:59.400
Looks like your friend was
ripped apart by a wild animal.

08:59.435 --> 09:00.865
Jesus.

09:00.900 --> 09:03.600
We're dealing with one sick son of a B.

09:03.635 --> 09:05.500
Took the victim's skin.

09:05.535 --> 09:06.765
Is... did...

09:06.800 --> 09:09.500
did... are there... are there any leads

09:09.535 --> 09:12.100
or... fingerprints or...?

09:12.135 --> 09:13.765
Slow down, guy.

09:13.800 --> 09:16.300
I mean, we only got
here, like, two hours ago.

09:16.335 --> 09:18.800
We strung up this yellow
tape, which took a while.

09:18.835 --> 09:22.100
So you knew the victim well?

09:22.135 --> 09:23.365
Yeah. I...

09:23.400 --> 09:24.565
He was a friend.

09:24.600 --> 09:27.300
He was... just became
an American citizen.

09:27.335 --> 09:28.817
And that made you angry.

09:28.852 --> 09:30.265
No, it made me happy.

09:30.300 --> 09:31.700
I was happy for him. He was...

09:31.735 --> 09:33.700
Then why'd you kill him?

09:34.700 --> 09:36.265
I didn't kill him.

09:36.300 --> 09:39.800
What... what are you talking about?

09:40.800 --> 09:43.200
Why are you staring at me like that?

09:44.200 --> 09:45.565
I'm just kidding.

09:45.600 --> 09:48.000
Come on. Maybe you
can help I.D. the body.

09:48.035 --> 09:48.865
Back here.

09:48.900 --> 09:50.800
I had you going, though... man!

10:12.000 --> 10:13.700
<i>The victim has been identified</i>

10:13.735 --> 10:14.965
<i>as Antonio Guzman.</i>

10:15.000 --> 10:16.600
<i>Here's what police told
us about the attack.</i>

10:16.635 --> 10:19.365
We will do the best we can,

10:19.400 --> 10:20.965
but I, for one, would like to put

10:21.000 --> 10:24.100
some of the responsibility
on the citizens of this town.

10:24.135 --> 10:26.417
There's only like
eight cops in this town,

10:26.452 --> 10:29.176
and there's thousands of you guys, so,

10:29.211 --> 10:31.900
not to point fingers or anything, but...

10:31.935 --> 10:34.200
Stay with us for the latest details

10:34.235 --> 10:35.700
on this developing story.

10:35.735 --> 10:38.000
Back to you, Gail.

10:45.700 --> 10:48.465
That's the half, and as the players

10:48.500 --> 10:50.300
march into the locking
room, we're going to be

10:50.335 --> 10:51.400
joined on the field by...

10:52.400 --> 10:54.300
Evan Trautwig.

11:08.200 --> 11:13.000
Did anyone here cry
themselves to sleep last night?

11:15.900 --> 11:17.865
It's okay. You can laugh.

11:17.900 --> 11:20.700
Laughter is a common
expression of grief.

11:20.735 --> 11:22.865
And yes, I did cry.

11:22.900 --> 11:25.765
Because a man was killed yesterday.

11:25.800 --> 11:30.700
But tonight, my tears
have turned to fists!

11:30.735 --> 11:32.800
Because whoever did this

11:32.835 --> 11:33.767
is still out there.

11:33.802 --> 11:34.665
Who is this guy?

11:34.700 --> 11:38.200
And we need to stop him
before he strikes again.

11:38.235 --> 11:39.465
Oh, struck again.

11:39.500 --> 11:41.400
No more murders!

11:43.600 --> 11:46.700
Because our society has rules.

11:46.735 --> 11:49.765
And one of those rules is:

11:49.800 --> 11:53.800
You can't kill someone
and take their skin!

11:53.835 --> 11:55.500
That's not cool.

11:57.500 --> 11:58.965
So, with that in mind,

11:59.000 --> 12:02.050
I am forming a neighborhood watch,

12:02.085 --> 12:05.092
a task force of concerned citizens

12:05.127 --> 12:08.065
to solve the murder of Antonio Guzman.

12:08.100 --> 12:11.600
To keep an eye on any and
all suspicious activities,

12:11.635 --> 12:14.765
and generally...

12:14.800 --> 12:17.400
get to the bottom of things.

12:17.435 --> 12:19.800
Thank you.

12:45.835 --> 12:47.265
Okay.

12:47.300 --> 12:49.065
Solid turnout.

12:49.100 --> 12:50.765
Thanks, everybody, for coming.

12:50.800 --> 12:52.700
You're that guy from Costco, right?

12:52.735 --> 12:54.600
Yes, I am that guy.

12:54.635 --> 12:55.217
Okay. Yeah.

12:55.252 --> 12:55.765
Thanks.

12:55.800 --> 12:57.300
All right, you want to...

12:58.600 --> 13:00.265
One more concerned citizen.

13:00.300 --> 13:01.800
You mind if I look around
the place a little bit?

13:01.835 --> 13:04.500
Looks like you got a lot of knickknacks.

13:04.535 --> 13:06.265
Oh, wow. Hi.

13:06.300 --> 13:09.400
Neighborhood watch meeting is...?

13:09.435 --> 13:10.964
Yes. Really?

13:10.965 --> 13:10.965
Yeah.

13:11.000 --> 13:12.500
Great.

13:12.535 --> 13:13.067
Okay.

13:13.102 --> 13:13.333
I'm Evan.

13:13.368 --> 13:13.565
I'm Jamarcus.

13:13.600 --> 13:14.700
Great to meet you.

13:14.735 --> 13:15.817
Good to meet you.

13:15.852 --> 13:16.865
Great. That's great.

13:16.900 --> 13:18.265
I was hoping another person would come,

13:18.300 --> 13:20.965
and you're the best type
of person it could be.

13:21.000 --> 13:23.600
I mean, actually, I couldn't
have even hoped as much for...

13:23.635 --> 13:24.517
This is...

13:24.552 --> 13:25.365
Come on in.

13:25.400 --> 13:27.900
I'm so pleased to have
this effect this early.

13:27.935 --> 13:29.100
Terrific. This is exciting.

13:29.065 --> 13:29.065
Come on in.

13:29.100 --> 13:30.864
Thank you. I'm excited, too.

13:30.865 --> 13:30.865
Great.

13:30.900 --> 13:32.650
Most people are disappointed

13:32.685 --> 13:34.400
when they meet me, which...

13:34.435 --> 13:34.967
British?

13:35.002 --> 13:35.465
I am.

13:35.500 --> 13:37.064
And you're American.

13:37.065 --> 13:37.065
Yeah.

13:37.100 --> 13:39.800
This looks like it's a...
Thailand or something.

13:39.835 --> 13:42.500
I don't know what it is.
I mean, it's b-beautiful.

13:42.535 --> 13:43.765
Oh, my God!

13:43.800 --> 13:45.450
There's another doll in here! Hi!

13:45.485 --> 13:47.100
Look at this, there's a doll in here.

13:47.135 --> 13:48.665
Hey, and look at this thing.

13:48.700 --> 13:50.450
Oh, my God, there's another one!

13:50.485 --> 13:52.200
Look at this. Did you know that?

13:52.235 --> 13:52.300
Yeah, yeah, I did.

13:52.335 --> 13:52.365
That's awesome.

13:52.400 --> 13:53.665
It's a Russian nesting doll.

13:53.700 --> 13:55.500
You want to have a seat
and we start the meeting?

13:55.535 --> 13:56.800
That's incredible. Look
at that little doll.

13:56.835 --> 13:57.900
Oh, my goodness, look at that.

13:57.935 --> 13:58.900
Yeah, yeah, can you...

13:58.935 --> 13:59.265
It keeps going.

13:59.300 --> 14:00.350
It keeps going. There's more.

14:00.385 --> 14:01.400
There's more dolls in here.

14:01.435 --> 14:01.665
Yeah.

14:01.700 --> 14:02.965
No, they call it a nesting doll.

14:03.000 --> 14:04.100
You want to sit down,
we can start the meeting?

14:04.135 --> 14:05.200
No, but they keep going.
There's more dolls.

14:05.235 --> 14:06.200
You have one doll, you have another...

14:06.235 --> 14:07.465
Put this on top of this doll.

14:07.500 --> 14:09.300
I just got to see... got
to get to the bottom of it.

14:09.335 --> 14:09.917
Yeah, there's a lot.

14:09.952 --> 14:10.465
You're kidding me.

14:10.500 --> 14:12.550
Okay, but why don't
we start the meeting.

14:12.585 --> 14:14.600
You're not gonna tell
me that it goes again.

14:14.635 --> 14:16.000
What's that?

14:18.000 --> 14:19.465
Guys, there's another one.

14:19.500 --> 14:20.600
Where can I pick one of these up?

14:20.635 --> 14:21.665
Yeah, I'm not sure.

14:21.700 --> 14:23.600
Want to sit down? We can get going?

14:23.635 --> 14:25.317
Okay, I'm gonna jump
in here and do this.

14:25.352 --> 14:27.000
Make a party out of this thing, right?

14:27.035 --> 14:28.400
Here's some handbooks.

14:28.435 --> 14:29.700
Here you go.

14:29.800 --> 14:31.865
All right.

14:31.900 --> 14:33.165
My name is Evan.

14:33.200 --> 14:34.765
I want to thank you all for coming.

14:34.800 --> 14:37.300
And I thought we'd start out by
just getting to know each other.

14:37.335 --> 14:40.900
Maybe we each stand up, say
who we are, why we joined up,

14:40.935 --> 14:42.865
what it's all about for us, okay?

14:42.900 --> 14:44.600
You have any beers
while we get acquainted?

14:44.635 --> 14:46.217
Beers? No.

14:46.252 --> 14:47.765
No beers.

14:47.800 --> 14:49.900
All right, well, I'll start this off.

14:49.935 --> 14:52.000
My name is Bob, with a "B."

14:52.035 --> 14:52.965
Okay. Welcome, Bob.

14:53.000 --> 14:54.065
And I love the town.

14:54.100 --> 14:55.665
I love my wife, I love my daughter,

14:55.700 --> 14:58.200
and I love getting a chance
to hang with the guys.

14:58.235 --> 15:00.417
So I'm really into
what you're doing here.

15:00.452 --> 15:02.600
Once a week, away
from the wife and kids,

15:02.635 --> 15:03.965
telling some dirty jokes,

15:04.000 --> 15:05.900
having some beers, if we're good.

15:05.935 --> 15:07.265
I really look forward

15:07.300 --> 15:09.800
to getting a chance at
tearing this shit up.

15:09.835 --> 15:11.067
Really fucking it up.

15:11.102 --> 15:12.265
Great. Thank you, Bob.

15:12.300 --> 15:13.800
Really great to meet you, bud.

15:13.835 --> 15:15.500
You, too, pal.

15:16.800 --> 15:19.565
That was a...

15:19.600 --> 15:22.200
that was a great speech.

15:22.235 --> 15:24.765
I'm Franklin.

15:24.800 --> 15:26.664
Welcome, Franklin.

15:26.665 --> 15:26.665
Yeah.

15:26.700 --> 15:31.100
Few years ago
dropped out of high school.

15:31.135 --> 15:33.065
Wasn't feeling the vibe.

15:33.100 --> 15:35.799
Wanted to become a member of
the Glenview Police Department.

15:35.800 --> 15:37.700
I guess they didn't see

15:37.735 --> 15:39.565
the magic that was me.

15:39.600 --> 15:42.965
Apparently, I didn't
pass the written exam

15:43.000 --> 15:47.400
or the physical exam or
the mental health exam.

15:47.435 --> 15:48.900
Whatever that means.

15:50.900 --> 15:52.765
So, here I am, with
this vigilante squad,

15:52.800 --> 15:55.365
and I figure that's the
best way to work through

15:55.400 --> 15:58.450
my emotional shit and bust
some heads in the process.

15:58.485 --> 16:01.042
Okay, just to be clear,
we're not a vigilante squad.

16:01.077 --> 16:03.600
Vigilante squad, militia...
whatever you're going for.

16:03.635 --> 16:04.665
Doesn't matter.

16:04.700 --> 16:06.800
No, not-not a militia
or a vigilante squad.

16:06.835 --> 16:08.065
Every group needs a wild card,

16:08.100 --> 16:10.500
and I think it's safe
to say we found ours.

16:10.535 --> 16:11.465
I dig it.

16:11.500 --> 16:13.150
Well, thank you, Franklin.

16:13.185 --> 16:14.800
We got a good one here.

16:14.065 --> 16:14.065
Yep.

16:14.100 --> 16:15.650
What are you about?

16:15.685 --> 16:17.092
Hello. Yeah.

16:17.127 --> 16:18.465
My name's Jamarcus.

16:18.500 --> 16:20.265
Recently very happily divorced,

16:20.300 --> 16:23.500
and just looking to get more
involved in the local community.

16:23.535 --> 16:25.117
Well, that was simple.

16:25.152 --> 16:26.700
Welcome, Jamarcus.

16:26.735 --> 16:27.765
Also,

16:27.800 --> 16:31.065
I have this one scenario in my mind

16:31.100 --> 16:33.165
that I'm kind of hoping
plays out like this.

16:33.200 --> 16:37.400
Young, sexy, Asian housewife
alone at night, frightened.

16:37.435 --> 16:38.765
A noise out

16:38.800 --> 16:40.065
by the trash cans.

16:40.100 --> 16:42.165
Best call the neighborhood watch.

16:42.200 --> 16:46.200
I show up, look heroic,
and then... get this...

16:46.235 --> 16:49.300
she sucks my balls.

16:51.600 --> 16:52.900
Hear me now!

16:55.900 --> 16:58.300
I'm also interested in
that happening to me.

16:58.335 --> 16:59.165
Okay.

16:59.200 --> 17:01.865
Well, Jamarcus, Bob, Franklin,

17:01.900 --> 17:04.599
I guess it doesn't matter
what brought us all here.

17:04.635 --> 17:06.800
What matters is that we're all united

17:06.835 --> 17:08.065
in one cause.

17:08.099 --> 17:10.000
And with that, I'd
like to welcome you all

17:10.035 --> 17:12.800
to the first official meeting of...

17:12.835 --> 17:15.400
the neighborhood watch.

17:15.435 --> 17:18.464
Okay, now,

17:18.500 --> 17:21.900
I've taken the liberty
of dividing Glenview

17:21.935 --> 17:23.964
into 12 sectors.

17:24.000 --> 17:25.464
Though some might argue there are 13,

17:25.500 --> 17:28.200
if you abide by the Yorktown
Zoning Commission ruling.

17:28.234 --> 17:29.467
I'm not buying it, but then again

17:29.502 --> 17:30.700
I'm not from Honeywell County.

17:30.735 --> 17:31.867
Thank God. Regardless...

17:31.902 --> 17:32.965
I'm sorry to be

17:33.000 --> 17:34.400
the squeaky wheel, but
it feels like you have

17:34.435 --> 17:35.400
a lot of dense material

17:35.435 --> 17:35.665
Yeah.

17:35.700 --> 17:36.750
That you're starting

17:36.785 --> 17:37.765
to go through here.

17:37.800 --> 17:39.200
And to be honest with you, you know,

17:39.235 --> 17:40.600
my house is about five blocks away,

17:40.635 --> 17:41.817
and I just fixed her up.

17:41.852 --> 17:42.965
Gentlemen, I got drinks,

17:43.000 --> 17:45.000
I got La-Z-Boys,
I got flat-screens,

17:45.035 --> 17:46.265
I got the whole nine.

17:46.300 --> 17:47.850
I know you guys are gonna love it.

17:47.885 --> 17:49.365
So I just want to throw it out there.

17:49.400 --> 17:50.950
If I'm overstepping, just
say the word and you're not

17:50.985 --> 17:52.500
gonna hear another squeak
from this little wheel.

17:52.535 --> 17:54.265
Well, honestly...

17:54.300 --> 17:56.000
That sounds a fuck-load
better than this.

17:55.965 --> 17:55.965
No offense.

17:56.000 --> 17:58.100
I don't even know why
I'm still sitting here.

17:58.135 --> 17:59.565
I'm gonna go warm up the car.

17:59.600 --> 18:02.700
You're gonna love this
place; it's awesome.

18:03.700 --> 18:05.965
Gentlemen...

18:06.000 --> 18:08.200
welcome to paradise.

18:09.500 --> 18:10.665
Oh! Yes!

18:10.700 --> 18:13.465
I'm a construction manager, and I built

18:13.500 --> 18:16.300
this little slice of heaven
with my own two hands.

18:16.335 --> 18:17.267
It's so nice. I love it.

18:17.302 --> 18:18.165
Thanks, everyone.

18:18.200 --> 18:19.700
Yeah, I'll set up over there.

18:19.735 --> 18:20.765
You have a pool table.

18:20.800 --> 18:21.965
Yeah. Just got it re-felted.

18:22.000 --> 18:23.600
Go ahead and take her for a spin.

18:23.635 --> 18:25.165
Here we go.

18:25.200 --> 18:26.565
Hey, you like that thing?

18:26.600 --> 18:28.450
It feels like this chair
is inside me, Robert.

18:28.485 --> 18:30.592
That is the best 2,300
bucks I ever spent.

18:30.627 --> 18:32.613
I got it at a place
called Relax-the-Back.com.

18:32.648 --> 18:34.524
It's like Toys "R" Us
for your ass and back.

18:34.559 --> 18:36.365
Feels like a thousand
little baby wizards are

18:36.400 --> 18:38.900
massaging my ass cheeks
with their little baby wands.

18:38.935 --> 18:40.265
Powerful imagery, brother!

18:40.300 --> 18:41.900
I'm digging where he's coming from!

18:41.865 --> 18:41.865
Handbooks. Boom.

18:41.900 --> 18:43.700
Rack them up. I'm in.
What are you drinking?

18:43.735 --> 18:45.500
What's your poison?
You down with scotch?

18:45.535 --> 18:46.467
I... no poison.

18:46.502 --> 18:47.365
Scotch and yes.

18:47.400 --> 18:49.400
No, no, no. No poison.

18:49.435 --> 18:49.435
Scotch and yes?

18:49.065 --> 18:49.065
No.

18:49.100 --> 18:51.165
Scotch and yes!

18:51.200 --> 18:52.600
You know, we got a
lot of ground to cover,

18:52.635 --> 18:53.965
and we're already an
hour behind, so why don't

18:54.000 --> 18:56.300
we just dig in, and then we
can get to whatever afterwards.

18:56.265 --> 18:56.265
Guitar.

18:56.300 --> 18:57.765
Come on, Evan.

18:57.800 --> 18:59.465
We're just bonding a little bit.

18:59.500 --> 19:01.500
Tell me about yourself.
I know you got a wife.

19:01.535 --> 19:03.000
Do you have any kids? How old?

19:03.035 --> 19:04.664
Zero years old.

19:04.665 --> 19:04.665
No kids.

19:04.700 --> 19:06.465
That's a shame.

19:06.500 --> 19:09.700
I couldn't imagine my life
without my little Chelsea.

19:09.735 --> 19:11.267
I mean, being a parent is...

19:11.302 --> 19:12.800
well, it's unbelievable.

19:12.835 --> 19:13.965
That's great.

19:14.000 --> 19:15.900
Dad, can I go to a movie at 11:00?

19:15.935 --> 19:18.367
Hell, no! It's a weeknight!

19:18.402 --> 19:20.464
But Mandy and Judy are going.

19:20.465 --> 19:20.465
Mandy?!

19:20.500 --> 19:21.865
Thank you for proving my point!

19:21.900 --> 19:24.100
Mandy's dead weight. She's a succubus.

19:24.135 --> 19:25.365
I told you that.

19:25.400 --> 19:27.200
Dad, I'm trying to talk
to you like an adult,

19:27.165 --> 19:27.165
and you just...

19:27.200 --> 19:28.465
Don't want to listen!

19:28.500 --> 19:29.665
That's right! So skedaddle!

19:29.700 --> 19:31.165
Get up there and do your homework!

19:31.200 --> 19:33.200
Are you serious?! I
fucking hate it here!

19:33.235 --> 19:34.867
Well, I fucking love it here!

19:34.902 --> 19:36.465
That's my little princess.

19:36.500 --> 19:37.865
That's my little angel,
Chelsea, right there.

19:37.900 --> 19:40.200
I'm sorry I didn't get a
chance to introduce you guys.

19:40.235 --> 19:41.717
How about some drinks?

19:41.752 --> 19:43.165
Fresh horses for my men!

19:43.200 --> 19:45.200
Tonight we ride! Get
in here, Frankfurter!

19:45.235 --> 19:45.235
Yes, thank you.

19:45.065 --> 19:45.065
Yeah!

19:45.100 --> 19:46.565
I don't...

19:46.600 --> 19:47.600
Come on, Evaroo.

19:47.635 --> 19:48.465
No, thanks.

19:48.500 --> 19:50.000
You'll be bummed if you don't.

19:49.965 --> 19:49.965
No, I don't...

19:50.000 --> 19:51.665
Can I interest anyone
in some finger foods?

19:51.700 --> 19:53.600
I got to order some pies
up in this thing, right?

19:53.635 --> 19:54.467
You guys want some pies?

19:54.502 --> 19:55.265
Okay, you know what?

19:55.300 --> 19:57.000
You guys got your own
thing going on there.

19:57.035 --> 19:58.765
I am going to

19:58.800 --> 19:59.565
put up some flyers.

19:59.600 --> 20:00.600
Come on, have one drink.

20:00.635 --> 20:01.267
No.

20:01.302 --> 20:01.583
Bye.

20:01.618 --> 20:01.865
No?

20:01.900 --> 20:03.400
All right, I'll see you guys.

20:03.435 --> 20:03.917
Okay.

20:03.952 --> 20:04.365
See you.

20:04.400 --> 20:06.064
Hey, see you tomorrow night.

20:06.065 --> 20:06.065
Okay.

20:06.100 --> 20:08.100
Same Bob time, same Bob place.

20:15.100 --> 20:17.265
Hey, fella!

20:17.300 --> 20:18.899
What are you doing?

20:18.900 --> 20:19.965
There you are.

20:20.000 --> 20:22.400
1162 Jerome Park Drive.

20:22.435 --> 20:23.665
Excuse me?

20:23.700 --> 20:25.750
I'm 1157 Jerome Park Drive.

20:25.785 --> 20:27.800
Name's Paul. Just moved in.

20:27.835 --> 20:30.000
Oh! You're... oh.

20:30.035 --> 20:30.965
Oh, sorry.

20:31.000 --> 20:32.500
I'm... I'm Evan.

20:32.535 --> 20:33.617
Hi.

20:33.652 --> 20:34.665
Evan.

20:34.700 --> 20:37.465
Evan Trautwig, subscriber
to Men's Fitness.

20:37.500 --> 20:40.800
Oh, yeah, that's... that
is... yeah, that's mine.

20:40.835 --> 20:41.765
Thank you.

20:41.800 --> 20:43.100
Not that you need it.

20:43.135 --> 20:44.765
Excuse me?

20:44.800 --> 20:48.000
You got the body of a decathlete, Evan.

20:50.000 --> 20:51.800
And you got great skin.

20:52.800 --> 20:56.500
You live here alone
in this big old house?

20:56.535 --> 20:57.865
No. No.

20:57.900 --> 20:59.600
I live with my wife.

20:59.635 --> 21:01.300
My female wife Abby.

21:06.300 --> 21:07.865
I'm gonna go inside now.

21:07.900 --> 21:10.000
All right, Evan Trautwig.

21:10.035 --> 21:11.700
Nice to meet you.

21:11.735 --> 21:13.165
Stay fit.

21:13.200 --> 21:14.600
Evan Trautwig!

21:14.635 --> 21:16.200
Yeah.

21:19.200 --> 21:22.465
<i>It was really cute.</i>

21:22.500 --> 21:23.865
We all got our own puff paints

21:23.900 --> 21:26.200
and made these little
customized onesies.

21:27.852 --> 21:29.365
Okay.

21:29.400 --> 21:30.700
So you started another club.

21:30.735 --> 21:31.665
No.

21:31.700 --> 21:32.765
It's not a club,

21:32.800 --> 21:34.765
it's a task force of concerned citizens.

21:34.800 --> 21:37.100
I went to the Spartans
game and made a speech,

21:37.135 --> 21:38.765
and the community really responded.

21:38.800 --> 21:43.600
Well, guess who peed on the
ovulation stick on the plane?

21:43.635 --> 21:44.917
You?

21:44.952 --> 21:46.165
Yep.

21:46.200 --> 21:48.200
It's kind of faint, but I
think there's two pink lines.

21:48.235 --> 21:49.465
Yeah, I can't tell.

21:49.500 --> 21:51.400
Well, I think we should do it anyway.

21:51.435 --> 21:53.400
I would love to do it.

21:53.435 --> 21:53.435
Just to be safe.

21:54.400 --> 21:56.065
But I got to go meet

21:56.100 --> 21:57.900
the neighborhood watch
guys for a patrol.

21:57.935 --> 22:00.565
Evan! You promised.

22:00.600 --> 22:02.600
I know, but I also
promised Antonio's family

22:02.635 --> 22:04.800
that I would catch his killer.

22:04.835 --> 22:06.265
I made a vow.

22:06.300 --> 22:07.265
Okay, okay, okay...

22:07.300 --> 22:09.050
It's a great group of guys.

22:09.085 --> 22:10.800
Really. I'm very excited.

22:10.835 --> 22:12.165
Here we go.

22:12.200 --> 22:13.700
Bad-ass jackets for the watch.

22:13.735 --> 22:15.200
I went to the mall this morning,

22:15.235 --> 22:16.217
and I had them made up.

22:16.252 --> 22:17.226
Get them while they're hot.

22:17.261 --> 22:18.200
- Blam.
- Let's do it.

22:18.385 --> 22:18.465
What?

22:18.500 --> 22:19.565
Thank you.

22:19.600 --> 22:20.450
Got your names on them.

22:20.485 --> 22:21.300
Got our names on them.

22:21.265 --> 22:21.265
Yep.

22:21.300 --> 22:22.600
All right, Bob.

22:22.635 --> 22:23.767
This is great.

22:23.802 --> 22:24.900
These are good.

22:24.935 --> 22:25.665
Okay.

22:25.700 --> 22:27.465
Hey, what-what happened to my logo?

22:27.500 --> 22:30.600
Oh, this is, this is just
like your initial logo,

22:30.635 --> 22:31.965
only now it's awesome.

22:32.000 --> 22:33.665
This has nothing to do
with my original logo.

22:33.700 --> 22:36.700
My logo was an eye that was
watching over the neighborhood.

22:36.735 --> 22:38.617
I don't know what this is.

22:38.652 --> 22:40.500
What, a tiger with wings?

22:40.535 --> 22:41.265
Exactly!

22:41.300 --> 22:42.265
This is a tiger,

22:42.300 --> 22:43.865
who's fierce and sleek.

22:43.900 --> 22:45.900
But it's got wings, so it
flies above the neighborhood,

22:45.935 --> 22:48.167
and if it sees a domestic
problem, it kills it!

22:48.202 --> 22:50.364
The other thing is,
your original one's here.

22:50.365 --> 22:50.365
So I think...

22:50.400 --> 22:52.600
Got the eye right there on the side.

22:52.635 --> 22:54.164
It's always on the side.

22:54.165 --> 22:54.165
Small on the side.

22:54.200 --> 22:56.500
That's weird, 'cause it's
like an eye on the shoulder,

22:56.535 --> 22:57.900
but there's a tiger on your back.

22:57.865 --> 22:57.865
Weird how?

22:57.900 --> 22:59.600
What are we, the flaming tigers?

22:59.635 --> 23:01.267
'Cause that's what it looks like.

23:01.302 --> 23:02.900
We're the flaming, flying tigers.

23:02.935 --> 23:04.465
It makes no sense.

23:04.500 --> 23:05.465
Are you out of your mind?!

23:05.500 --> 23:06.965
This is inspiring for the watch!

23:07.000 --> 23:09.900
Whenever you have a
tiger, flames and wings,

23:09.935 --> 23:11.465
all in the same logo,

23:11.500 --> 23:14.400
it's like the Chinese symbol
for "Shut the fuck up and dance!"

23:14.435 --> 23:16.165
This is inspiring for the watch!

23:16.200 --> 23:17.850
I don't know. What are
we, in a doo-wop group?

23:17.885 --> 23:19.500
We're gonna, like,
stand over a garbage can

23:19.535 --> 23:20.565
with fire and harmonize?

23:20.600 --> 23:22.200
I would see this doo-wop group.

23:22.235 --> 23:23.465
Hey, for your information,

23:23.500 --> 23:25.365
doo-wop groups were known to close ass.

23:25.400 --> 23:28.200
Singing was their hobby,
closing ass was their job.

23:28.235 --> 23:29.465
The baritone from Boyz II Men had to

23:29.500 --> 23:31.200
stop making music 'cause
he got so much pussy.

23:31.235 --> 23:32.865
- Thank you.
- They're like ass collectors.

23:32.900 --> 23:34.900
This is not about fashion,
this is about brotherhood,

23:34.935 --> 23:35.965
this is about solidarity.

23:36.000 --> 23:37.500
You should get that more than anybody.

23:37.535 --> 23:38.517
He's actually right.

23:38.552 --> 23:39.465
Pigs have uniforms,

23:39.500 --> 23:41.065
I think we should have uniforms, too.

23:41.100 --> 23:43.300
We got to match those
fuckers on every level.

23:43.335 --> 23:44.900
Understand? Every level.

23:44.935 --> 23:46.917
Can I just say, Bob,

23:46.952 --> 23:48.900
that these are the shit.

23:48.935 --> 23:50.265
Just the shit.

23:50.300 --> 23:54.100
These are just shit.

23:56.100 --> 23:58.000
Okay, you know what, fine.

23:58.035 --> 23:59.165
I'll wear it.

23:59.200 --> 24:01.300
But you have to promise me that tonight

24:01.335 --> 24:03.400
we're actually gonna do something, okay?

24:03.435 --> 24:04.017
Absolutely.

24:04.052 --> 24:04.565
For sure.

24:04.600 --> 24:06.600
Gentlemen, we're part
of more than a club,

24:06.635 --> 24:08.065
we're part of a way of life.

24:08.100 --> 24:09.500
We're making a commitment to ourselves

24:09.535 --> 24:10.465
and to the watch today.

24:10.500 --> 24:11.700
Get your hands in here, Evan.

24:11.735 --> 24:12.865
Get that pretty hand in there.

24:12.900 --> 24:14.500
On three, let me hear you sing it out

24:14.535 --> 24:16.300
with pride in your hearts.

24:16.335 --> 24:17.717
Neighborhood watch.

24:17.752 --> 24:19.065
One, two, three.

24:19.100 --> 24:20.400
Neighborhood watch!

24:22.400 --> 24:23.965
<i>Yeah, this is boring.</i>

24:24.000 --> 24:25.165
<i>Yeah, Franklin's right.</i>

24:25.200 --> 24:27.300
We're not gonna sit
here all night, are we?

24:27.335 --> 24:28.300
Yeah, guys, we are.

24:28.265 --> 24:28.265
Really?

24:28.300 --> 24:30.000
If we need to.

24:30.100 --> 24:31.165
It's a stakeout.

24:31.200 --> 24:32.965
I don't mean to

24:33.000 --> 24:34.950
sound childish, but I do have to pee.

24:34.985 --> 24:36.865
You should've peed earlier. I'm sorry.

24:36.900 --> 24:38.900
As an adult, you're just
gonna have to hold it.

24:38.935 --> 24:41.264
How you doing, Jamarcus?

24:41.265 --> 24:41.265
Ready.

24:41.300 --> 24:42.765
I still have to pee.

24:42.800 --> 24:44.200
You know, the liquid
comes in, the liquid's

24:44.235 --> 24:45.365
got to come out; I got to piss.

24:45.400 --> 24:46.500
Here. Why don't you just pee in this.

24:46.535 --> 24:47.465
Oh, great.

24:47.500 --> 24:48.465
That's a good idea.

24:48.500 --> 24:49.600
No, no, don't pee in that.

24:49.635 --> 24:50.367
I got to mount up.

24:50.402 --> 24:51.100
What are you doing?

24:51.065 --> 24:51.065
No, don't...

24:51.100 --> 24:52.165
I'm mounting up to piss.

24:52.200 --> 24:53.200
You're not gonna pee in a can.

24:53.235 --> 24:53.500
Why not?

24:53.535 --> 24:53.765
No, Bob.

24:53.800 --> 24:54.965
I'm not gonna miss anything.

24:55.000 --> 24:56.200
I'm a good shot, I'm
gonna get it perfect.

24:56.165 --> 24:56.165
Open the door.

24:56.200 --> 24:58.100
I've taken lots of road trips.

24:58.135 --> 24:59.964
I've always done this shit.

24:59.965 --> 24:59.965
No, piss out the door.

25:00.000 --> 25:01.500
And blow our-our stakeout
position? No shot.

25:01.535 --> 25:02.767
You're not gonna pee in a can.

25:02.802 --> 25:03.965
I'd never hear the end of it

25:04.000 --> 25:06.100
from you if I blew our stakeout
position; there's no shot.

25:06.135 --> 25:07.600
So I got to mount up. I'm mounting up.

25:07.635 --> 25:08.817
Okay, and we're going.

25:08.852 --> 25:10.000
Oh, my God, we're going.

25:10.035 --> 25:10.565
You're in.

25:10.600 --> 25:12.065
Oh, my God, we're going.

25:12.100 --> 25:14.800
This is almost like... I've
had to pee so bad for so long,

25:14.835 --> 25:16.100
it's borderline sexual, Evaroo.

25:16.135 --> 25:18.064
I'm not missing, either.

25:18.065 --> 25:18.065
It's so controlled.

25:18.100 --> 25:19.700
I mean, it's incredibly
controlled, Evan.

25:19.735 --> 25:21.700
It's like he's threading a needle.

25:21.165 --> 25:21.165
I know I'm okay

25:21.200 --> 25:23.200
'cause I can feel the
steel right around the tip.

25:23.235 --> 25:24.565
I'm squishing it against it.

25:24.600 --> 25:26.250
I got the mushroom pushed
right against the cold steel.

25:26.285 --> 25:27.900
Bob, hit me with a beat.
Hit me with a stop and go.

25:27.935 --> 25:29.900
Stop it. Make it happen.

25:30.100 --> 25:31.050
Stop it. Make it happen.

25:31.085 --> 25:32.000
Stop it.

25:32.800 --> 25:34.200
Make it happen.

25:34.235 --> 25:35.417
Killing it.

25:35.452 --> 25:36.600
And we're done.

25:36.565 --> 25:36.565
Good.

25:36.600 --> 25:37.665
Well done. Well done.

25:37.700 --> 25:38.800
Oh, thank you. That was a good one.

25:38.900 --> 25:40.800
Would you be a pal and hold this for me?

25:40.765 --> 25:40.765
Oh, come on! Come on!

25:40.800 --> 25:42.400
Just so I can get repositioned.

25:42.435 --> 25:43.400
That's enough!

25:43.435 --> 25:43.565
Come on!

25:43.600 --> 25:45.850
I'm busting your chain!
I'm busting your chain!

25:45.885 --> 25:48.100
Hey, did I miss anything
while I was pissing?

25:48.135 --> 25:49.300
Did we catch the killer?

25:50.300 --> 25:51.665
Lighten up, big guy!

25:51.700 --> 25:54.265
I'm glad you think
this is so funny, Bob.

25:54.300 --> 25:56.865
I'm glad you think this
is a laugh riot, okay?

25:56.900 --> 25:59.700
Let's all have a laugh
while Antonio Guzman's killer

25:59.735 --> 26:01.300
continues to roam free.

26:01.335 --> 26:02.717
You know what?

26:02.752 --> 26:04.065
He's right.

26:04.100 --> 26:05.800
That sicko's probably
out there right now,

26:05.835 --> 26:07.865
staring at us from a distance,

26:07.900 --> 26:09.800
beating the living shit out of his dick,

26:09.835 --> 26:12.300
reliving his sick fantasy.

26:14.400 --> 26:16.100
What are you doing?

26:16.135 --> 26:17.065
Popping a top.

26:17.100 --> 26:18.864
No, no, you can't do that.

26:18.865 --> 26:18.865
Why not?

26:18.900 --> 26:20.465
It's against the law.

26:20.500 --> 26:23.200
It's illegal. You can't
have open alcohol in the car.

26:23.235 --> 26:24.265
The car's not moving.

26:24.300 --> 26:25.700
There's not even a key in the ignition.

26:25.735 --> 26:26.665
Doesn't matter, it's still...

26:26.700 --> 26:28.100
Franklin, you failed the police test.

26:28.135 --> 26:29.065
Is this illegal?

26:29.100 --> 26:30.465
It's definitely illegal.

26:30.500 --> 26:33.200
But I also failed the boring
test, you know what I'm saying?

26:33.235 --> 26:33.817
I dig it.

26:33.852 --> 26:34.726

Evening, gentlemen.

Doing a little cruising?

27:06.485 --> 27:07.765
No, Officers.

We're actually on...
neighborhood watch business.

Hide your bong, Chucho.

27:13.702 --> 27:16.301
Neighborhood watch is here.

27:16.336 --> 27:18.900
Sergeant, you remember me?

27:18.935 --> 27:19.965
No.

27:20.000 --> 27:21.800
What, have I arrested you before?

27:21.835 --> 27:23.700
Not so good with faces.

27:23.735 --> 27:25.165
Faces.

27:25.200 --> 27:26.065
You're a cop.

27:26.100 --> 27:27.165
What do you mean you're not...

27:27.200 --> 27:29.400
You're not good with faces? What?!

27:29.435 --> 27:30.565
I don't see the connection.

27:30.600 --> 27:33.300
What I have been
seeing are these babies.

27:33.335 --> 27:34.500
How's it been going?

27:34.535 --> 27:36.200
Good, actually.

27:36.235 --> 27:37.317
Very good.

27:37.352 --> 27:38.365
Great.

27:38.400 --> 27:39.565
Yeah, we thought we'd start here

27:39.600 --> 27:41.100
at the Costco and stake
it out for a while.

27:41.135 --> 27:42.565
'Cause, as you know, most killers

27:42.600 --> 27:44.200
return to the scene of the crime, so...

27:44.235 --> 27:45.865
Oh, of course they do.

27:45.900 --> 27:49.200
The killer always returns
to the scene of the crime.

27:49.235 --> 27:50.865
So...

27:50.900 --> 27:53.800
fancy seeing you here, Trautwig.

27:53.835 --> 27:55.617
At the scene of the crime.

27:55.652 --> 27:57.365
I don't know what that means.

27:57.400 --> 28:00.700
It means it's super-suspicious
that you're here right now.

28:00.735 --> 28:03.600
And it makes me feel like
you have some secrets.

28:03.635 --> 28:05.400
Well, I don't.

28:07.100 --> 28:10.400
Any-who, when you fellas
finish playing Hardy Boys,

28:10.435 --> 28:12.417
don't forget to pay this ticket

28:12.452 --> 28:14.400
for those open alcohol containers.

28:19.400 --> 28:20.765
And...

28:20.800 --> 28:23.900
this one is for putting up
200 flyers without a permit.

28:23.935 --> 28:24.700
What?!

28:24.800 --> 28:26.200
I'm sorry, guys.

28:28.200 --> 28:30.600
You fellas have a safe night.

28:30.635 --> 28:32.300
Hit it, Chucho.

28:37.100 --> 28:39.365
Goddamn it!

28:39.400 --> 28:40.565
I know he remembers me!

28:40.600 --> 28:41.965
He's just messing with my head!

28:42.000 --> 28:43.700
You can't drink in your car anymore?

28:43.735 --> 28:45.400
What the hell is this country coming to?

28:47.400 --> 28:49.850
Evan Trautwig.

28:49.885 --> 28:52.265
Yes, of course.

28:52.300 --> 28:55.600
Noise complaint at the football field.

28:55.635 --> 28:57.800
This is it, guys.

28:57.900 --> 28:59.750
It's our first call.

28:59.785 --> 29:01.600
Hell, yeah. Let's roll!

29:01.635 --> 29:03.700
Let's do it.

29:23.600 --> 29:26.100
You see anything?

29:30.465 --> 29:30.465
Hello?

29:30.500 --> 29:32.265
What the hell?

29:32.300 --> 29:33.300
Turn off the lights!

29:35.000 --> 29:35.650
What?!

29:35.685 --> 29:36.265
I'm hit!

29:36.300 --> 29:38.165
What the fuck is going on?!

29:38.200 --> 29:40.000
Robert, we're getting ambushed here!

29:40.035 --> 29:41.864
They're kids!

29:41.865 --> 29:41.865
Eggs!

29:41.900 --> 29:43.400
Yeah, we're getting
egged! It's raining eggs!

29:43.435 --> 29:44.465
We came to help!

29:44.500 --> 29:46.065
Yolk's on you, ass wipes!

29:46.100 --> 29:48.300
Yolk's on me?! A fucking pun?!

29:48.335 --> 29:50.400
I'm gonna kill this kid.

29:50.435 --> 29:52.064
I'm gonna kill you!

29:52.065 --> 29:52.065
Goddamn it!

29:52.100 --> 29:54.200
They're getting away, Bob!

29:54.235 --> 29:55.165
No, they're not.

29:55.200 --> 29:57.150
Because one of us is the founder

29:57.185 --> 29:59.100
of the Glenview Running Club!

30:10.900 --> 30:12.250
Yeah, you fucked him up, man!

30:12.285 --> 30:13.565
Who's laughing now, kid?

30:13.600 --> 30:16.265
I bet you didn't egg-pect
to get your ass kicked.

30:16.300 --> 30:18.200
You throw eggs at
people, you think that's funny?

30:18.235 --> 30:19.517
Look how much pain he's in.

30:19.552 --> 30:20.765
Guess what you learned tonight.

30:20.800 --> 30:23.400

30:57.335 --> 30:58.967
Egging, Sergeant.

30:59.002 --> 31:00.600

31:05.300 --> 31:09.400
Then he tried to run away
on his little skitter-board.

31:09.435 --> 31:10.400
Did you really?

31:11.500 --> 31:14.350
Get back to the playground
and the monkey bars.

31:14.385 --> 31:17.200

throw eggs at people?

31:17.235 --> 31:18.065
Do you?

31:18.100 --> 31:20.300
You gonna answer the question?

31:20.335 --> 31:21.665
It's rude.

31:21.700 --> 31:24.100
It hurts people's feelings
and it hurts their faces.

31:24.135 --> 31:26.467
And now you deal with the consequences.

31:26.502 --> 31:28.800
Homegirl's trying to make an omelet.

31:28.835 --> 31:29.567
Yeah, look at me.

31:29.602 --> 31:30.451
Look at his face.

31:30.486 --> 31:31.265
Look at my face.

31:31.300 --> 31:32.500
Look at his face and listen to me.

31:32.535 --> 31:33.717
Look at him and listen to me.

31:33.752 --> 31:34.865
Look at him and understand me.

31:34.900 --> 31:36.800
Look at both of us,
but understand no one.

31:36.835 --> 31:39.000
Listen to my words and hear his face.

31:39.035 --> 31:39.965
Do you think it is funny

31:40.000 --> 31:41.365
to throw an egg in somebody's face?

31:41.400 --> 31:42.700
You think it's funny?
You think it's a yolk?

31:42.735 --> 31:44.000
I'll shove a full egg
inside your asshole

31:44.035 --> 31:45.065
and watch it hatch.

31:45.100 --> 31:46.964
Franklin. Inappropriate.

31:46.965 --> 31:46.965
Sorry.

31:47.000 --> 31:48.500
No, I understand, it's too far.

31:48.535 --> 31:49.565
Sorry.

32:02.300 --> 32:05.000

32:05.035 --> 32:06.765
Am I under arrest?

32:06.800 --> 32:08.365
Of course not. Those guys are a joke.

32:08.400 --> 32:10.400
Okay, can one of you guys give
me a ride home or something?

32:10.435 --> 32:11.465
Fuck no.

32:11.500 --> 32:12.950

we focus on the living.

34:26.335 --> 34:27.600
Just drive us out of here.

34:27.565 --> 34:27.565
Just drive away!

34:27.600 --> 34:28.800

34:49.199 --> 34:51.000
What the fuck is this thing?

34:53.000 --> 34:56.300
Looks like an octopus
tentacle or something.

34:56.335 --> 34:57.767
All right, well, I think

34:57.802 --> 34:59.001
it's very obvious what,

34:59.036 --> 35:00.118
what happened here, guys.

35:00.153 --> 35:01.165
It doesn't take, you know,

35:01.200 --> 35:03.300
a brain surgeon to figure this one out.

35:03.335 --> 35:05.365
Evan accidentally... obviously, right...

35:05.400 --> 35:07.400
hit a crate that fell
off the back of a truck

35:07.435 --> 35:09.100
that just so happened to be carrying

35:09.135 --> 35:11.065
some freshly caught octopus

35:11.100 --> 35:13.400
to a nearby sushi establishment.

35:13.435 --> 35:15.665
It's octopus, and a fresh one.

35:15.700 --> 35:18.500
Right, you got nothing but the
thing and the octopus and this,

35:18.535 --> 35:21.100
and I think we pack it in
and we know what happened.

35:21.135 --> 35:23.065
Okay, worst-case scenario:

35:23.100 --> 35:24.900
Evan murdered a Japanese
man who was eating octopus

35:24.935 --> 35:25.917
while crossing the street.

35:25.952 --> 35:26.900
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa...

35:26.935 --> 35:27.865
I didn't... come on,

35:27.900 --> 35:29.700
I did not murder anybody.

35:29.735 --> 35:30.967
Doesn't matter.

35:31.002 --> 35:32.165
You know why?

35:32.200 --> 35:34.200
'Cause no one's going to say
shit about this to anybody

35:34.235 --> 35:35.365
'cause we don't dime

35:35.400 --> 35:37.600
on our fellow neighborhood
watchers, okay?

35:39.600 --> 35:41.565
Wait a second, I've
seen this stuff before.

35:41.600 --> 35:44.350
Back at Costco, this was
the stuff by Antonio's body.

35:44.385 --> 35:47.100
Had he just won a Nickelodeon's
Kids' Choice Award?

35:47.135 --> 35:47.900
Franklin, he was dead.

35:47.935 --> 35:48.665
So he wasn't eligible.

35:48.700 --> 35:50.465
That's pretty amazing, then,

35:50.500 --> 35:52.200
that he won 'cause usually
you have to do some sort

35:52.235 --> 35:55.600
of kids type thing to win that award.

35:57.600 --> 35:59.399
Feels like cum.

35:59.400 --> 36:00.665
Well, I dare anyone

36:00.700 --> 36:02.700
to touch it and tell me
it doesn't feel like cum.

36:02.735 --> 36:04.365
May I?

36:04.400 --> 36:06.265
Yeah, that's cum.

36:06.300 --> 36:07.600
Well, it's green, it's
not cum, but I'm saying

36:07.635 --> 36:08.800
it's a cum... it feels like cum.

36:08.835 --> 36:10.865
The texture, the flavor,

36:10.900 --> 36:12.800
the color, the consistency...

36:12.835 --> 36:15.665
It's very cum-like.

36:15.700 --> 36:17.800
Hey, guys, check this
out, I found something.

36:17.835 --> 36:19.317
What is it?

36:19.352 --> 36:20.765
I don't know.

36:20.800 --> 36:24.300
Looks like a big silver
basketball or something.

36:29.265 --> 36:29.265
What is it?

36:29.300 --> 36:31.600
It looks like a toy.

36:34.600 --> 36:36.350
What the fuck is that?

36:36.385 --> 36:38.100
What's going on

36:38.135 --> 36:39.065
up here?

36:39.100 --> 36:40.165
We got company.

36:40.200 --> 36:41.900
What in the hell are you people doing

36:41.935 --> 36:43.065
in my yard?!

36:43.100 --> 36:44.900
Hi, sorry, we're the Neighborhood Watch.

36:44.935 --> 36:46.467
We were just out on a nightly patrol.

36:46.502 --> 36:47.965
How you doing? I'm Evan Trautwig.

36:48.000 --> 36:50.900
I got your neighborhood
watch right here, sweet lips.

36:50.935 --> 36:52.365
We-We're, we're on your side, sir.

36:52.400 --> 36:54.300
We're just wondering if
you heard anything strange

36:54.335 --> 36:56.417
or just anything out
of the ordinary tonight.

36:56.452 --> 36:58.500
You mean, like four
nitwits standing around

36:58.535 --> 37:00.417
on my lawn in the middle of the night?

37:00.452 --> 37:02.300
That's kind of strange, don't you think?

37:02.265 --> 37:02.265
Okay.

37:02.300 --> 37:03.465
Hey, you know what, pal?

37:03.500 --> 37:05.065
If being overly aggressive
and a little bit snippy

37:05.100 --> 37:07.850
was a crime, I'd be making
a citizen's arrest right now.

37:07.885 --> 37:09.942
Why don't you just shut your
cocksucker there, dickweed?

37:09.977 --> 37:12.088
You know, we're taking time
out of our busy schedules

37:12.123 --> 37:14.200
to help the neighborhood,
so I think you could just...

37:14.235 --> 37:15.200
you know, you don't have to...

37:15.500 --> 37:18.600
Excuse me, got a phone call here.

37:18.635 --> 37:20.164
Hey, Bill.

37:20.165 --> 37:20.165
Bill.

37:20.200 --> 37:21.365
I got four members

37:21.400 --> 37:23.200
of the Baby-sitters Club up here...

37:23.235 --> 37:23.967
It's the Neighborhood Watch.

37:24.002 --> 37:24.665
Trying to solve some kind

37:24.700 --> 37:27.000
of mystery before beddy-bye time.

37:27.035 --> 37:28.217
I'll call you back later.

37:28.252 --> 37:29.365
All right, okay, we...

37:29.400 --> 37:31.600
It's okay, sir, we get it, we're...

37:31.635 --> 37:33.217
Thank you for... We'll just...

37:33.252 --> 37:34.765
You guys, I'm gonna count to ten.

37:34.800 --> 37:36.100
Okay, you know what? Let's start again.

37:36.135 --> 37:37.200
I'm gonna count to ten!

37:37.235 --> 37:38.200
He wants to count.

37:38.235 --> 37:38.400
Okay.

37:38.435 --> 37:38.565
One...

37:38.600 --> 37:40.200
Steal that cool ball.

37:40.235 --> 37:41.967
Two, three...

37:42.002 --> 37:43.551
Nice to meet you.

37:43.586 --> 37:45.100
Fuck you, Curly!

37:45.135 --> 37:46.365
Four.

37:46.400 --> 37:49.900
Get in your goddamn soccer
mom van and move on out.

37:50.900 --> 37:52.650
Neighborhood Watch.

37:52.685 --> 37:54.400
What a fucking joke.

37:56.400 --> 37:58.465
Look at this.

37:58.500 --> 38:00.500
Every time I stick a finger
in, another light goes on.

38:00.535 --> 38:02.300
That's weird.

38:04.300 --> 38:05.365
Hey, why don't we try to stick

38:05.400 --> 38:06.800
all our fingers in at the same time,

38:06.835 --> 38:08.067
see what happens?

38:08.102 --> 38:09.265
All right, guys,

38:09.300 --> 38:11.000
let's all finger these holes together.

38:11.035 --> 38:12.365
This is a bad idea.

38:12.400 --> 38:14.865
Oh, don't be such a
pussy, Jamarcus, come on.

38:14.900 --> 38:16.500
- Come over here and finger
- Bang this ball with us.

38:16.535 --> 38:18.517
I don't like this.

38:18.552 --> 38:19.864
Come on, Jamarcus.

38:19.865 --> 38:19.865
Okay,

38:19.900 --> 38:21.650
fine, but this is a bad idea.

38:21.685 --> 38:23.400
Get your finger in there.

38:23.435 --> 38:24.235
Okay.

38:31.885 --> 38:32.865
Jesus!

38:32.900 --> 38:34.350
Shit! Holy shit!

38:34.385 --> 38:36.592
Are you kidding me?

38:36.627 --> 38:37.263
Did you see that shit?

38:37.298 --> 38:37.865
That cow's fucking head

38:37.900 --> 38:39.200
exploded all over the place.

38:39.235 --> 38:40.465
That's terrible for the cow,

38:40.500 --> 38:42.100
but this thing's fucking awesome.

38:42.135 --> 38:43.417
This is a major find.

38:43.452 --> 38:44.665
This thing is the shit.

38:44.700 --> 38:46.350
Okay, nobody touches this ball

38:46.385 --> 38:47.965
till we figure out what it is.

38:48.000 --> 38:50.700
We definitely should not
fuck around with this thing.

38:50.735 --> 38:53.400
The last thing we want to
do is cause a disturbance.

38:56.300 --> 38:57.800
♪ Straight outta Compton... ♪

38:58.900 --> 39:00.900
Good-bye, tractor!

39:26.700 --> 39:28.200
<i>Hey, wait, that's hilarious.</i>

39:28.235 --> 39:29.467
That was so fun.

39:29.502 --> 39:30.851
I mean, we blew

39:30.886 --> 39:32.165
that shit up.

39:32.200 --> 39:34.200
That cow's fucking head
just poof ed, just puffed.

39:34.235 --> 39:34.765
Oh, man.

39:34.800 --> 39:35.965
Guys, this is not from this world.

39:36.000 --> 39:37.565
I, I, I think it could be
the government, you know.

39:37.600 --> 39:39.900
There are lots of these kind
of prototypes that you find.

39:39.935 --> 39:41.465
It's always the government.

39:41.500 --> 39:42.700
I don't disagree that there could be

39:42.735 --> 39:43.865
a government or an alien

39:43.900 --> 39:45.965
or where governments and aliens connect.

39:46.000 --> 39:48.200
Get the fuck out of here,
man, this is not alien shit.

39:48.235 --> 39:49.200
I think you're paranoid.

39:49.235 --> 39:49.465
I'm not paranoid.

39:49.500 --> 39:50.900
Everything is on the table; right now

39:50.935 --> 39:51.567
we don't take anything off.

39:51.602 --> 39:52.165
This was probably on the way

39:52.200 --> 39:53.600
to the fucking Mac Store,
and it fell off the truck.

39:53.635 --> 39:54.765
What the fuck is this? This is like

39:54.800 --> 39:57.600
a Magical 8 Ball bowling
ball that blows shit up.

39:57.635 --> 39:58.900
I'm trying to find a killer here.

39:58.935 --> 39:59.900
Right, a killer alien.

39:59.935 --> 40:00.465
It's a...

40:00.500 --> 40:01.565
Somebody killed Antonio.

40:01.600 --> 40:02.800
Okay, I don't know if they're an alien,

40:02.835 --> 40:03.965
I don't know if it was an octopus.

40:04.000 --> 40:05.665
I don't know what it was or who it was,

40:05.700 --> 40:06.800
but this has something
to do with it, right?

40:06.835 --> 40:07.367
You. Well, you.

40:07.402 --> 40:07.865
Yes, that's a yes.

40:07.900 --> 40:09.300
Let's go to the things we can agree on.

40:09.335 --> 40:10.317
We don't know what it is.

40:10.352 --> 40:11.265
That's correct as well.

40:11.300 --> 40:13.300
It's the same goo that
was on Antonio's body.

40:13.335 --> 40:13.765
This is

40:13.800 --> 40:16.000
information you're sharing,
and I'll say yes to it.

40:16.035 --> 40:18.200
The goo was on the car,
the orb was near the car.

40:18.235 --> 40:19.865
Let's call her Lucy.

40:19.900 --> 40:20.900
The second after we find Lucy...

40:20.935 --> 40:21.365
Lucy.

40:21.400 --> 40:23.300
Who kicks us off his property?

40:23.335 --> 40:25.265
Crazy old guy with a shotgun.

40:25.300 --> 40:27.765
Why'd he want us off his property?

40:27.800 --> 40:29.800
- Why did he not want us near the ball or the goo?
- Right?

40:29.835 --> 40:31.217
This is the guy, we
got to kick his tires.

40:31.252 --> 40:32.726
There's something we got to figure out.

40:32.761 --> 40:34.165
I think we dress Franklin up as a girl

40:34.200 --> 40:37.065
named Fran-Francesca, he
goes to the door as a salesman

40:37.100 --> 40:39.100
because they'll suspect him any
other way. He's pretty enough.

40:39.135 --> 40:39.967
I'm, I'm listening.

40:40.002 --> 40:40.765
He's an attractive guy

40:40.800 --> 40:42.765
and he has the features
where he can fool 'em.

40:42.800 --> 40:45.800
- Feminine features.
- So we put Franklin in a costume,

40:45.835 --> 40:46.517
send him for the old man.

40:46.552 --> 40:47.165
He's lonely, he's lonely.

40:47.200 --> 40:48.600
He'll let Franklin in the house.

40:48.565 --> 40:48.565
Boom, he's in.

40:48.600 --> 40:50.265
We're inside the house.

40:50.300 --> 40:52.150
Now it's intel, he's under the radar.

40:52.185 --> 40:53.965
It's an attractive lady showing up.

40:54.000 --> 40:56.800
His liver-spotted hands are
going to want to caress her.

40:56.835 --> 40:58.400
Can I tell you something, Bob?

40:59.400 --> 41:00.900
That could work.

41:00.935 --> 41:01.965
Yes!

41:02.000 --> 41:03.000
Here's the thing.

41:03.035 --> 41:03.565
Finally!

41:03.600 --> 41:05.400
I'm not going to go past
second with this old guy,

41:05.435 --> 41:06.665
but if I have to, I will.

41:06.700 --> 41:07.950
I think it's important we get,

41:07.985 --> 41:09.165
we get really, really confirmed

41:09.200 --> 41:11.000
on what you're prepared to
do so it's not a new thing.

41:11.035 --> 41:11.817
Let's talk about it.

41:11.852 --> 41:12.776
I will use both hands.

41:12.811 --> 41:13.665
I won't use a mouth.

41:13.700 --> 41:15.200
He may use his hands and
may not use his mouth.

41:15.235 --> 41:16.465
Well, I think you got

41:16.500 --> 41:17.700
to make it all go down
before you get found out.

41:17.735 --> 41:18.765
Here's the issue.

41:18.800 --> 41:20.000
- What's the best
- Case on this one?

41:20.035 --> 41:21.165
Okay, here's the best-case scenario:

41:21.200 --> 41:22.500
He's a lonely old
man, he wants to waltz,

41:22.535 --> 41:23.565
he wants to listen to some

41:23.600 --> 41:25.265
of the old songs from his childhood.

41:25.300 --> 41:27.350
Worst-case scenario: you're
getting fucked in the ass.

41:27.385 --> 41:29.692
Either way we're gonna find
out who this old man is.

41:29.727 --> 41:32.013
Either way we're gonna get
involved in this guy's life.

41:32.048 --> 41:34.300
Here's the pressing question:
What do we do with this?

41:34.335 --> 41:35.864
We don't give it to the cops.

41:35.865 --> 41:35.865
Agreed.

41:35.900 --> 41:37.550
This is ours; No one hears about it.

41:37.585 --> 41:38.942
I don't know, but we keep it

41:38.977 --> 41:40.300
a Neighborhood Watch secret.

41:40.265 --> 41:40.265
Cheers.

41:40.300 --> 41:41.500
Well, we're in the game.

41:41.535 --> 41:43.100
To the watch.

41:43.135 --> 41:44.100
Boom.

42:23.500 --> 42:26.500
"OMG, Mandy's party is so awesome."

42:26.535 --> 42:28.765
Good for Mandy.

42:28.800 --> 42:30.800
Frickin' kidding me, right?

42:41.700 --> 42:43.965
Chelsea!

42:44.000 --> 42:45.300
Dad, what the F?

42:45.335 --> 42:46.265
Don't F me.

42:46.300 --> 42:48.264
Who's this boy toy named Jason?

42:48.265 --> 42:48.265
Boy toy?

42:48.300 --> 42:50.065
What's his toy story?

42:50.100 --> 42:53.500
Oh, wait, were you creeping
on my Facebook again?

42:53.535 --> 42:54.465
Are you kidding me?

42:54.500 --> 42:56.365
You're gonna let some guy car-wash

42:56.400 --> 42:58.065
the inside of your mouth with his tongue

42:58.100 --> 43:00.300
and then you're gonna
post it on the Internet?

43:00.335 --> 43:01.700
Stop Internet stalking me, okay?

43:01.735 --> 43:03.065
Just get out of my room.

43:03.100 --> 43:04.500
You don't see me and your
mom posting our sessions

43:04.535 --> 43:05.500
on the Internet, do you?

43:05.535 --> 43:05.630
That's

43:05.665 --> 43:05.665
disgusting, Dad.

43:05.700 --> 43:07.300
Well, how do you think that makes

43:07.335 --> 43:08.265
me feel? It is disgusting.

43:08.300 --> 43:10.050
You keep your tongue in your mouth.

43:10.085 --> 43:11.542
And what's going on with this collage?

43:11.577 --> 43:13.000
This is moving in the
direction of, like,

43:13.035 --> 43:14.000
strippers on spring break.

43:14.035 --> 43:14.165
Oh, my God.

43:14.200 --> 43:15.400
That's a collage of my friends, Dad.

43:15.435 --> 43:16.365
This is uncomfortable.

43:16.400 --> 43:17.665
The whole thing's uncomfortable.

43:17.700 --> 43:18.900
I'm not comfortable with
what's going on, Chelsea.

43:18.935 --> 43:20.700
If you're uncomfortable, then get out.

43:20.735 --> 43:24.065
Sex is for love.

43:24.100 --> 43:25.900
Here's what's happening
now... the video's off.

43:26.000 --> 43:27.700
Okay, Dad, I'm gonna get the video off.

43:27.735 --> 43:28.367
Fine, right, okay.

43:28.402 --> 43:29.000
Or we got a problem.

43:28.965 --> 43:28.965
Please get out.

43:29.000 --> 43:30.250
Houston, we have a problem.

43:30.285 --> 43:31.465
Okay, Dad, that's good.

43:31.500 --> 43:33.464
Really productive conversation.

43:33.465 --> 43:33.465
Seriously, really.

43:33.500 --> 43:35.100
We should do more of it.

43:38.100 --> 43:40.565
Right on the edge.

43:40.600 --> 43:42.300
You're right on the edge.

44:08.000 --> 44:12.264
♪ You and tequila make me crazy... ♪

44:12.265 --> 44:12.265
Hey.

44:12.300 --> 44:13.765
Hey, buddy.

44:13.800 --> 44:15.600
Come on, I saved a seat for you.

44:15.635 --> 44:17.317
Said you were desperate.

44:17.352 --> 44:18.965
Yeah, here, take a load off.

44:19.000 --> 44:21.600
Look, I know we're trying to
catch the Costco Killer, but,

44:21.635 --> 44:23.100
well, it's good to have
an honest heart-to-heart

44:23.135 --> 44:25.800
with just a couple of guys, right?

44:25.835 --> 44:26.967
There's my boy.

44:27.002 --> 44:28.100
Bring it down here.

44:28.135 --> 44:29.865
Get in here.

44:29.900 --> 44:32.100
It's all about honesty, right?

44:33.200 --> 44:34.700
I've been being honest with my daughter.

44:34.735 --> 44:36.400
I don't think she wants to hear it.

44:37.600 --> 44:39.465
My wife's been traveling
so much for work that a,

44:39.500 --> 44:42.700
you know, a lot of the parenting
stuff has fallen on me lately.

44:42.735 --> 44:43.965
How about you?

44:44.000 --> 44:47.800
When are you going to take
the plunge and knock a few out?

44:47.835 --> 44:50.265
It's not that simple.

44:50.300 --> 44:54.500
Well, it's about as simple as
putting your dick in a vagina.

44:54.535 --> 44:56.717
You know what I mean? Make it happen.

44:56.752 --> 44:58.900
Well, I don't really
have a choice, so...

45:00.900 --> 45:05.800
It turns out that my gun doesn't really

45:05.835 --> 45:07.700
shoot too well.

45:07.735 --> 45:08.467
Gun?

45:08.502 --> 45:09.165
Yeah.

45:09.200 --> 45:10.265
You mean your prick?

45:10.300 --> 45:11.365
Why are you saying "gun"?

45:11.400 --> 45:13.000
This is two guys sitting on a bench.

45:13.035 --> 45:14.467
You can say it, say
"prick," say "cock."

45:14.502 --> 45:15.900
Just say "prick. " Anyway, did you take

45:15.935 --> 45:17.000
a couple of those blue bombers?

45:16.965 --> 45:16.965
No.

45:17.000 --> 45:18.500
Got to get that wang nice and stiff

45:18.535 --> 45:19.500
and get you all monstered up.

45:19.535 --> 45:20.267
No, no, no.

45:20.302 --> 45:20.965
Oh, it will,

45:21.000 --> 45:22.000
and then you'll be fucking
like a champ in no time.

45:22.035 --> 45:22.530
No.

45:22.565 --> 45:22.565
No, I can, I, that's...

45:22.600 --> 45:24.500
I know a guy that'll give you some

45:24.535 --> 45:26.500
and I got some from Mexico...

45:26.535 --> 45:27.400
That's not the problem.

45:27.435 --> 45:27.765
I'll get you some

45:27.800 --> 45:28.750
of those Mexican bombs.

45:28.785 --> 45:30.492
I can do everything.

45:30.527 --> 45:32.200
It's just that...

45:33.200 --> 45:35.764
I'm... about a year and a half ago...

45:35.765 --> 45:35.765
Okay.

45:35.800 --> 45:38.000
Abby and I started trying

45:38.035 --> 45:39.000
to have kids...

45:39.200 --> 45:41.365
and nothing was happening, so,

45:41.400 --> 45:45.100
on my own, I went to see this
doctor, to get my sperm checked.

45:45.135 --> 45:46.365
You know, I've always
wondered about that.

45:46.400 --> 45:48.500
I've just had a curiosity
about it if you don't mind.

45:48.535 --> 45:50.600
When you go to one of those doctors,

45:50.635 --> 45:52.065
do you jerk yourself off

45:52.100 --> 45:53.800
or does the doctor, like, jerk you off

45:53.835 --> 45:55.065
or, like, an assistant?

45:55.100 --> 45:57.200
Is it like a massage parlor or
do they have, like, a machine,

45:57.235 --> 45:58.900
like, a medical machine that
does the milking for you?

45:58.935 --> 46:01.800
Like, milks you like an animal?

46:02.800 --> 46:04.600
I'm asking how you
get the cum out of you.

46:04.565 --> 46:04.565
I...

46:04.600 --> 46:05.865
They do it.

46:05.900 --> 46:08.864
No, I jerked me off.

46:08.865 --> 46:08.865
Okay.

46:08.900 --> 46:10.265
Doesn't matter.

46:10.300 --> 46:14.200
The point is, I went, I got tested,

46:14.235 --> 46:17.865
and... no go.

46:17.900 --> 46:20.665
I'm shooting blanks.

46:20.700 --> 46:22.350
I, I could shoot a bucketful,

46:22.385 --> 46:23.965
it would make no difference.

46:24.000 --> 46:27.100
Doctor's actual words... "a bucketful."

46:27.135 --> 46:30.200
It's because of me, we can't have kids.

46:30.235 --> 46:32.065
Just me.

46:32.100 --> 46:34.600
I didn't realize that
that's such a big deal.

46:34.635 --> 46:35.765
I mean, it's 2012.

46:35.800 --> 46:39.000
Can't you just get,
like, a ball transplant?

46:39.035 --> 46:42.217
Yeah, I don't think the
science is there yet.

46:42.252 --> 46:45.400
What'd the old lady
say when you told her?

46:48.400 --> 46:49.365
Evaroony, don't tell me

46:49.400 --> 46:51.100
that you haven't talked to her about it.

46:51.135 --> 46:54.800
Well, what am I going to say?

46:54.835 --> 46:57.165
Hey, honey, guess what?

46:57.200 --> 47:00.400
The one thing you
want most in the world,

47:00.435 --> 47:02.865
I can't give you.

47:02.900 --> 47:05.900
Evan, you listen to me.

47:05.935 --> 47:08.267
You talk to Abby.

47:08.302 --> 47:10.501
She married you,

47:10.536 --> 47:12.700
not your dead jizz.

47:13.700 --> 47:15.200
Thanks.

47:20.500 --> 47:21.865
Evan Trautwig.

47:21.900 --> 47:24.300
Hey, this is Manfred Salisbury.

47:24.335 --> 47:25.300
Are you on my roof?

47:25.335 --> 47:25.765
What?

47:25.800 --> 47:27.600
Well, there's somebody on my roof

47:27.635 --> 47:28.767
jumping around like a maniac.

47:28.802 --> 47:30.451
Is that one of you idiots?

47:30.486 --> 47:32.065
It most certainly is not.

47:32.100 --> 47:34.400
Please just hang
tight, Mr. Salisbury,

47:34.435 --> 47:35.467
we'll be right there.

47:35.502 --> 47:36.901
Yeah, I'll bet you will.

47:36.936 --> 47:38.768
Got to get to Manfred's.

47:38.803 --> 47:40.600
Call the Watch; come on.

47:49.600 --> 47:51.600
Nobody's here.

47:52.600 --> 47:53.665
Seriously?

47:53.700 --> 47:54.800
You see anybody on the roof?

47:54.835 --> 47:56.665
No.

47:56.700 --> 47:58.250
Okay, we should fan out. Franklin,

47:58.285 --> 47:59.542
you and Bob get in the car, check

47:59.577 --> 48:00.938
the block, see if you get any action.

48:00.973 --> 48:02.300
Jamarcus and I will go around back.

48:02.335 --> 48:03.467
Okay.

48:03.502 --> 48:04.701
Got it.

48:04.736 --> 48:05.865

We should go.

Yeah, and maybe he's
really pissed off about it

You okay?

51:28.200 --> 51:32.100
That was really stressful.

51:32.135 --> 51:34.400
I think I killed it.

51:35.400 --> 51:36.400
<i>What's going on here?</i>

51:36.435 --> 51:37.365
<i>Gentlemen,</i>

51:37.400 --> 51:38.800
we formed the Neighborhood Watch

51:38.835 --> 51:40.665
with a very specific task:

51:40.700 --> 51:44.100
To find the murderer of
my friend Antonio Guzman.

51:44.135 --> 51:47.500
Well, tonight, I say to you...

51:49.500 --> 51:51.000
Holy shit!

51:51.035 --> 51:52.465
Jesus Christ!

51:52.500 --> 51:53.900
What the fuck is that?!

51:53.935 --> 51:55.665
It's an alien.

51:55.700 --> 51:57.500
It killed Manfred, then
it tried to kill Jamarcus,

51:57.535 --> 51:58.565
and I came up

51:58.600 --> 52:00.250
and I nailed it with a garden gnome

52:00.285 --> 52:01.900
and it cracked its neck and it's dead.

52:01.935 --> 52:03.300
This is fucking insane.

52:03.335 --> 52:05.065
I know, I know.

52:05.100 --> 52:06.800
We tried to find a
killer, but guess what...

52:06.835 --> 52:08.165
we found a frickin' alien.

52:08.200 --> 52:11.100
It touches it
and it feels it...

52:11.135 --> 52:13.317
This intelligent,

52:13.352 --> 52:15.465
sentient being

52:15.500 --> 52:18.100
traveled untold light-years

52:18.135 --> 52:20.700
to come and visit our planet.

52:20.735 --> 52:22.400
And you killed him.

52:24.400 --> 52:25.565
Nice!

52:25.600 --> 52:26.965
Evan, yeah!

52:27.000 --> 52:28.764
He killed it.

52:28.765 --> 52:28.765
Holy shit.

52:28.800 --> 52:31.050
Man, screw the police department.

52:31.085 --> 52:33.265
I'm gonna get into the CIA for this.

52:33.300 --> 52:35.300
I think we should slow down,
we should keep this quiet.

52:35.335 --> 52:37.100
Or a hundred miles an
hour and really loud,

52:37.135 --> 52:38.300
because you're looking at an alien.

52:38.335 --> 52:39.817
I'm thinking about T-shirts,

52:39.852 --> 52:41.300
merchandising, movie deals...

52:41.335 --> 52:42.365
my mind's going crazy

52:42.400 --> 52:44.000
with this thing here.
All right, who wants

52:44.035 --> 52:45.265
a snapper with the alien?

52:45.300 --> 52:47.100
What am I thinking?
Right, let's go, bitches.

52:47.135 --> 52:48.417
I don't want to put pressure on you,

52:48.452 --> 52:49.665
but it's the first historical picture

52:49.700 --> 52:52.300
of anyone with an alien, so
whatever that means to you.

52:52.335 --> 52:53.865
Here we go, ready,
and we're bringing it.

52:53.900 --> 52:56.900

sunshine... somebody get in here.

Bob, the pool balls aren't hurting him.

54:12.335 --> 54:13.600
Franklin, you've got to hit him.

54:13.565 --> 54:13.565
Fuck.

54:13.600 --> 54:15.165
This is bad aim.

54:15.200 --> 54:15.932
Please don't kill me!

54:15.967 --> 54:16.665
Hey, hey, al-alien.

54:16.700 --> 54:19.100

54:19.135 --> 54:20.365
He's not a bumblebee!

54:20.400 --> 54:21.750
Evan, help! He's gonna kill me

54:21.785 --> 54:23.100
and I don't know what to do.

54:29.000 --> 54:30.400
Oh, shit!

54:32.400 --> 54:34.900
Oh, shit! Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

54:34.935 --> 54:37.300
He's gonna eat my face!

54:39.700 --> 54:42.400
He's getting goo in my mouth!

54:42.435 --> 54:43.332
Pull him up.

54:43.367 --> 54:44.300
Oh, my God!

54:48.000 --> 54:49.600
Franklin, Jamarcus.

54:54.400 --> 54:56.764
I can taste the fucking goo!

54:56.765 --> 54:56.765
Bring him down.

54:56.800 --> 54:59.100
That's right. Give up, go to sleep.

55:00.100 --> 55:03.265
Relax, you go to sleep.

55:03.300 --> 55:07.200
We are already among you.

55:18.200 --> 55:19.900
What the fuck was that?!

55:19.935 --> 55:21.565
You can forget about

55:21.600 --> 55:23.100
the damn merchandising play.

55:23.135 --> 55:24.100
Is everyone all right?

55:24.600 --> 55:26.700
Fucking alien came on my face.

55:28.600 --> 55:30.100
Did you hear that thing?

55:32.200 --> 55:34.500
"We are among you"?

55:34.535 --> 55:35.217
What does that mean?

55:35.252 --> 55:35.865
Means there's more

55:35.900 --> 55:37.900
of those damn things out there.

55:37.935 --> 55:40.365
Oh, my God.

55:40.400 --> 55:42.000
That's why they take the skins.

55:44.000 --> 55:46.000
To wear them.

55:46.035 --> 55:47.817
They're among us.

55:47.852 --> 55:49.565
Oh, fucking great.

55:49.600 --> 55:51.700
And that damn thing's been to my house.

55:51.735 --> 55:52.567
He knows where I live.

55:52.602 --> 55:53.365
I think if that thing

55:53.400 --> 55:54.665
had wanted us dead, we'd be dead, Bob.

55:54.700 --> 55:57.700
So we don't know who is
and who isn't an alien.

55:57.735 --> 55:59.800
Bressman's one of them, I guarantee it.

55:59.835 --> 56:01.965
1,000 percent.

56:02.000 --> 56:02.965
Yeah, we should keep this quiet

56:03.000 --> 56:05.100
until we find out who we can trust.

56:05.135 --> 56:07.200
And right now, we can't trust anybody.

57:16.100 --> 57:17.465
I'm not dealing with this well.

57:17.500 --> 57:20.100
Any one of these people
could be an alien.

57:23.100 --> 57:24.200
Check her out.

57:25.200 --> 57:26.465
It's like she's studying

57:26.500 --> 57:28.800
some new discovery or something.

57:28.835 --> 57:31.717
Some strange object, some weird,

57:31.752 --> 57:34.565
bizarre human... circle fruit.

57:34.600 --> 57:37.500
Looks like she's thinking,
can I ingest this?

57:37.535 --> 57:39.017
Should I put it

57:39.052 --> 57:40.465
in my flavor snout?

57:40.500 --> 57:42.800
Look at this piece of shit over here.

57:42.835 --> 57:44.717
That alien hasn't learned

57:44.752 --> 57:46.926
how to eat properly yet.

57:46.961 --> 57:49.100
So primitive, so clumsy.

57:51.100 --> 57:52.600
So dangerous.

57:55.600 --> 57:58.065
There's that motherfucking Jason kid.

57:58.100 --> 58:01.500
That's the kid that's all
over Chelsea's Facebook page.

58:03.500 --> 58:05.100
Magnums?! There's no way

58:05.135 --> 58:05.617
your dick's that big!

58:05.652 --> 58:06.100
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

58:06.135 --> 58:08.365
Bob.

58:08.400 --> 58:09.000
It's a family store.

58:09.035 --> 58:09.565
I'm just saying,

58:09.600 --> 58:10.900
there's no way his dick's that big

58:10.935 --> 58:12.467
he needs to buy that shit.

58:12.502 --> 58:13.965
Some people's are that big.

58:14.000 --> 58:16.000
Otherwise, they wouldn't
sell condoms like that.

58:16.035 --> 58:17.165
He's right, they're a big seller.

58:17.200 --> 58:19.000
I swear to God, I'm
gonna rip his dick off.

58:19.035 --> 58:20.900
You're gonna need two hands, Bobby.

58:20.935 --> 58:21.900
Hello there, neighbor.

58:22.700 --> 58:24.565
Jesus.

58:24.600 --> 58:25.565
I'm so sorry.

58:25.600 --> 58:27.099
Did I startle you?

58:27.100 --> 58:29.000
It's good for you, you know, though.

58:29.035 --> 58:29.035
Gets the heart racing.

58:29.800 --> 58:31.765
And I know you like to stay fit.

58:31.800 --> 58:36.300
In any case, I just moseyed
on over here to invite you to

58:36.335 --> 58:38.167
a little bit of a gathering

58:38.202 --> 58:39.965
I'm having at my... home.

58:40.000 --> 58:45.100
A lot of interesting characters
will be in attendance.

58:45.135 --> 58:47.400
And...

58:50.400 --> 58:53.965
Well, I'll think about it.

58:54.000 --> 58:55.700
Oh, well, don't think about it too long,

58:55.735 --> 58:57.800
because before you know it...

58:59.300 --> 59:00.765
life's over.

59:00.800 --> 59:03.600
Isn't that the truth?

59:09.600 --> 59:13.165
Holy shit.

59:13.200 --> 59:14.665
He's one of them.

59:14.700 --> 59:17.600
I can't believe I didn't
figure it out earlier.

59:17.635 --> 59:19.967
He's so creepy, he's been spying on me.

59:20.002 --> 59:22.300
He said I had nice skin the other night.

59:22.335 --> 59:23.517
Get it?

59:23.552 --> 59:24.665
Skin.

59:24.700 --> 59:25.750
Yeah, you have incredible skin.

59:25.785 --> 59:27.442
You don't have to brag about it.

59:27.477 --> 59:29.065
No, the aliens rip off the skin.

59:29.100 --> 59:30.800
Did you see all the
batteries that guy bought?

59:30.835 --> 59:33.017
Nobody needs that many batteries.

59:33.052 --> 59:35.200
I mean, nobody from Earth, that is.

59:35.235 --> 59:37.900
He said, "Before we know it..."

59:37.935 --> 59:39.665
life ends."

59:39.700 --> 59:41.700
Maybe he thinks you're
getting kind of close

59:41.735 --> 59:43.465
and he wants to take you out.

59:43.500 --> 59:44.865
This is what it's about, tonight.

59:44.900 --> 59:47.300
This is why we formed
the Neighborhood Watch.

59:49.300 --> 59:51.065
Just got to grab my jacket.

59:51.100 --> 59:53.165
ABBY Oh, thank goodness.

59:53.200 --> 59:55.300
It's the leader of
the Neighborhood Watch.

59:55.335 --> 59:57.265
Abby, what the fuck?

59:57.300 --> 01:00:00.000
I'm forming a little club, too,
and it's only got one opening,

01:00:01.800 --> 01:00:02.700
do you have any water?

01:00:02.735 --> 01:00:03.667
Oh, my God!

01:00:03.702 --> 01:00:04.651
No, no, no, no!

01:00:04.686 --> 01:00:05.600
Go out, go out.

01:00:05.700 --> 01:00:06.600
Get out, get out.

01:00:06.635 --> 01:00:07.465
Is that Mrs. Evan?

01:00:07.500 --> 01:00:08.500
- Just leave.
- That's your jacket.

01:00:08.535 --> 01:00:09.500
That's your wife?

01:00:09.535 --> 01:00:09.665
Stop.

01:00:09.700 --> 01:00:10.700
It's nice to meet you, Mrs. Trautwig.

01:00:10.735 --> 01:00:11.917
- Well done, though.
- Get out!

01:00:11.952 --> 01:00:13.026
I'm Franklin. I work with...

01:00:13.061 --> 01:00:14.100
I'm a dear friend of Evan's.

01:00:14.135 --> 01:00:14.565
She doesn't care.

01:00:14.600 --> 01:00:16.365
Honey... what is... what?

01:00:16.400 --> 01:00:18.700
You're starting a club, you
want me to fill your hole?

01:00:18.735 --> 01:00:19.617
What-what's going on?

01:00:19.652 --> 01:00:20.465
Are you making fun of me?

01:00:20.500 --> 01:00:21.700
Honey, I'm not making fun of you.

01:00:21.735 --> 01:00:22.865
You look awesome.

01:00:22.900 --> 01:00:25.865
It's just, the timing
kind of is weird and...

01:00:25.900 --> 01:00:28.300
No, what's weird is that I
have to make an appointment

01:00:28.335 --> 01:00:30.300
to have sex with my husband.

01:00:30.335 --> 01:00:30.465
No, you don't.

01:00:30.500 --> 01:00:33.400
And then he forgets and brings
a bunch of weird dudes over.

01:00:33.435 --> 01:00:35.200
I mean, that little one saw everything.

01:00:35.165 --> 01:00:35.165
Evan, come on!

01:00:35.200 --> 01:00:37.150
Oh, honey, I'm sorry.

01:00:37.185 --> 01:00:39.100
I forgot. I'm sorry.

01:00:39.200 --> 01:00:41.165
Yeah. You forgot.

01:00:41.200 --> 01:00:43.400
BOB Give her some
truth, pal. She needs it.

01:00:43.435 --> 01:00:44.765
What? What is that?

01:00:44.800 --> 01:00:46.800
Be that truth-teller, brother!

01:00:46.835 --> 01:00:46.835
He's... I don't know.

01:00:46.870 --> 01:00:47.765
I have no idea.

01:00:47.800 --> 01:00:50.400
You know, I don't even care.

01:00:50.435 --> 01:00:51.365
Just here.

01:00:51.400 --> 01:00:52.565
Go play with your friends.

01:00:52.600 --> 01:00:53.900
Take your stupid jacket and go.

01:00:53.935 --> 01:00:55.067
Honey, please believe me.

01:00:55.102 --> 01:00:56.165
There are forces greater

01:00:56.200 --> 01:00:57.665
than what we're talking about here

01:00:57.700 --> 01:01:00.100
that I can't explain to you,
that I promise I will explain

01:01:00.135 --> 01:01:02.500
to you at a certain point,
but it just can't be right now.

01:01:02.465 --> 01:01:02.465
Go!

01:01:02.500 --> 01:01:04.450
I'm sorry.

01:01:04.485 --> 01:01:06.400
Honey, if I...

01:01:09.400 --> 01:01:11.500
Come on.

01:01:30.600 --> 01:01:32.265
Hey.

01:01:32.300 --> 01:01:33.665
It's beer.

01:01:33.700 --> 01:01:35.265
You serious?

01:01:35.300 --> 01:01:36.300
Do you want some?

01:01:36.400 --> 01:01:38.300
Here we go. Someone's coming.

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:43.365
Do you see that?

01:01:43.400 --> 01:01:44.600
We don't know what that is,

01:01:44.635 --> 01:01:45.700
but that's a couple.

01:01:54.900 --> 01:01:58.300
Guys, I definitely smell
alien all over this thing.

01:01:58.335 --> 01:02:00.065
Bob! Vibrate!

01:02:00.100 --> 01:02:02.200
Give me one second. Hang on.

01:02:02.235 --> 01:02:03.964
One second. Hello.

01:02:03.965 --> 01:02:03.965
What?

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:05.465
What are you doing?

01:02:05.500 --> 01:02:06.999
Are her parents gonna be there?

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:08.265
Absolutely not!

01:02:08.300 --> 01:02:09.300
What the hell are you talking about?

01:02:09.500 --> 01:02:10.200
Chel... no!

01:02:10.235 --> 01:02:10.865
Hey.

01:02:10.900 --> 01:02:12.900
Damn it, guys. I'm sorry,
we got to get out of here.

01:02:12.865 --> 01:02:12.865
Come on, go.

01:02:12.900 --> 01:02:14.265
What are you doing?

01:02:14.300 --> 01:02:16.300
We got to move out quick. Let's go.

01:02:15.965 --> 01:02:15.965
What are you doing?

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:18.500
You're gonna give away our position.

01:02:18.535 --> 01:02:19.565
Okay, listen to me.

01:02:19.600 --> 01:02:20.800
I got to fill you in quick.

01:02:20.900 --> 01:02:23.300
Chelsea is on her way to
Mandy's house for a party.

01:02:23.335 --> 01:02:24.517
Her parents are not there.

01:02:24.552 --> 01:02:25.665
Now, what I can gather so far

01:02:25.700 --> 01:02:27.300
from Mandy's Facebook page
is she's a total whore.

01:02:27.335 --> 01:02:28.900
This is gonna be a
full-blown fuck festival.

01:02:28.935 --> 01:02:29.900
There's gonna be touching and pulling,

01:02:29.935 --> 01:02:30.865
there's gonna be climaxing.

01:02:30.900 --> 01:02:32.000
Chelsea's gonna be there any minute.

01:02:32.035 --> 01:02:33.067
I cannot allow that to happen.

01:02:33.102 --> 01:02:34.065
I need you guys to come with me.

01:02:34.100 --> 01:02:35.800
We need to put a stop to this. Let's go.

01:02:35.835 --> 01:02:37.065
Bob, what are you talking about?

01:02:37.100 --> 01:02:40.800
We are literally on the possible
doorstep of an alien hive.

01:02:40.835 --> 01:02:41.765
You're right. You know what,

01:02:41.800 --> 01:02:43.265
we got to split up for a little bit.

01:02:43.300 --> 01:02:44.565
Jamarky-Mark, you
stay with the Evanator.

01:02:44.600 --> 01:02:46.000
That's right. And you,
Frankfurter, you come with me.

01:02:46.035 --> 01:02:47.465
Me and my guy work well together.

01:02:47.500 --> 01:02:49.000
I'm so fucking far ahead
of you it's not even funny.

01:02:49.035 --> 01:02:50.000
- No, no, no!
- Let's go!

01:02:50.035 --> 01:02:51.165
Franklin, Franklin!

01:02:51.200 --> 01:02:52.200
- Franklin, Franklin, Franklin.
- Let's go.

01:02:52.235 --> 01:02:53.400
You're not going anywhere.

01:02:53.435 --> 01:02:54.365
Bob, your daughter

01:02:54.400 --> 01:02:55.465
is not official business.

01:02:55.500 --> 01:02:57.265
Now, our mandate is to pursue murderers

01:02:57.300 --> 01:02:59.900
and thieves and aliens
and anyone who threatens

01:02:59.935 --> 01:03:02.465
to tear the fabric of
this neighborhood apart.

01:03:02.500 --> 01:03:05.050
Well, my mandate as a father
is to pursue little pricks

01:03:05.085 --> 01:03:07.600
that try to tear the fabric
of my daughter's hymen apart!

01:03:08.700 --> 01:03:10.300
Don't you walk away.

01:03:10.335 --> 01:03:12.167
Don't you dare.

01:03:12.202 --> 01:03:14.301
Oh, I dare.

01:03:14.336 --> 01:03:16.365
Caw-caw!

01:03:16.400 --> 01:03:17.900
This sucks! This sucks!

01:03:17.935 --> 01:03:18.817
Caw-caw!

01:03:18.852 --> 01:03:19.776
Shut up!

01:03:19.811 --> 01:03:20.665
I'm a bird!

01:03:20.700 --> 01:03:22.500
They can't hear me, idiot!

01:03:22.535 --> 01:03:24.067
We're good.

01:03:24.102 --> 01:03:25.501
Let's go.

01:03:25.536 --> 01:03:26.900
You...!

01:03:37.600 --> 01:03:40.300
Sounds like somebody's
getting ripped apart in there.

01:03:40.335 --> 01:03:42.767
Smells funky and musty.

01:03:42.802 --> 01:03:45.200
Do you see anything...

01:03:47.100 --> 01:03:48.300
You okay?

01:03:48.335 --> 01:03:49.165
Aye.

01:03:49.200 --> 01:03:50.250
Are you okay?

01:03:50.285 --> 01:03:51.292
I'm okay.

01:03:51.327 --> 01:03:52.913
Hi, Paul.

01:03:52.948 --> 01:03:54.224
Hi, Evan.

01:03:54.500 --> 01:03:55.765
You all right?

01:03:55.800 --> 01:03:57.565
Scared us.

01:03:57.600 --> 01:03:59.500
And who is this mountain of a man?

01:03:59.535 --> 01:04:02.500
My name's Jamarcus.

01:04:02.535 --> 01:04:03.800
He's Jamarcus.

01:04:03.835 --> 01:04:05.900
Shall we?

01:04:10.300 --> 01:04:13.165

Thanks for taking me here.

01:04:29.952 --> 01:04:32.265
This is erotic as hell.

01:04:32.300 --> 01:04:35.400
Big Bob, you got daughter
at midnight, 12:00.

01:04:35.435 --> 01:04:36.565
Move to extraction?

01:04:36.600 --> 01:04:37.765
Stand down, Seal Six.

01:04:37.800 --> 01:04:39.250
We go in there hot, we'll humiliate her

01:04:39.285 --> 01:04:40.700
for the rest of her high school days.

01:04:40.735 --> 01:04:42.467
Let's just lay low.

01:04:42.502 --> 01:04:44.165
Just taking in intel.

01:04:44.200 --> 01:04:46.750
Look, there's that kid from
Costco with the big fat dick.

01:04:46.785 --> 01:04:49.300
Walking around with his massive
cock like he owns the joint.

01:04:49.335 --> 01:04:51.500
That shit's just banging
against his kneecaps.

01:04:51.535 --> 01:04:52.865
20 bucks that guy's dick

01:04:52.900 --> 01:04:55.500
dips in the toilet when he takes a shit.

01:04:57.800 --> 01:04:58.800
Oh, hey, girl.

01:05:01.700 --> 01:05:03.265
Oh, yeah.

01:05:03.300 --> 01:05:04.365
Dig that shit!

01:05:04.400 --> 01:05:06.500
Dig that shit! Who's your daddy?!

01:05:06.535 --> 01:05:08.600
I'm her daddy, you piece of shit!

01:05:08.635 --> 01:05:10.465
Come to Daddy's bedroom.

01:05:10.500 --> 01:05:12.499
Yeah, it's the master bedroom.

01:05:12.500 --> 01:05:13.765
Let's move ass!

01:05:13.800 --> 01:05:15.300
Which way are we going here?

01:05:15.335 --> 01:05:16.765
Down, down!

01:05:16.800 --> 01:05:18.600
Right this way, gentlemen.

01:05:18.635 --> 01:05:21.217
Please, after you.

01:05:21.252 --> 01:05:23.800
Thank you, Jamarcus.

01:05:30.400 --> 01:05:31.265
It's a nice...

01:05:31.300 --> 01:05:32.900
place you got here, Paul.

01:05:32.935 --> 01:05:33.865
Like the paint.

01:05:33.900 --> 01:05:36.365
Oh, thank you, Evan Trautwig.

01:05:36.400 --> 01:05:39.500
And allow me to pay you
a compliment in kind.

01:05:39.535 --> 01:05:42.600
I see you out there
jog, jog, jog, jogging,

01:05:42.635 --> 01:05:43.965
and I often think to myself,

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:47.500
my God, what a perfect specimen...

01:05:47.535 --> 01:05:48.465
Excuse me.

01:05:48.500 --> 01:05:50.400
Two perfect specimens.

01:05:50.435 --> 01:05:53.165
Gentlemen...

01:05:53.200 --> 01:05:55.700
say good-bye to the
world as you know it.

01:05:57.700 --> 01:05:59.665
More!

01:05:59.700 --> 01:06:02.800
And say hello to paradise.

01:06:05.400 --> 01:06:08.100
Welcome to the sanctuary
of the human spirit, gents,

01:06:08.135 --> 01:06:11.700
because tonight's all about freedom.

01:06:11.735 --> 01:06:15.600
And some about boning.

01:06:16.600 --> 01:06:18.600
Think we solved the battery mystery.

01:06:20.700 --> 01:06:21.965
Come on in, boys.

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:23.565
The water is just right.

01:06:23.600 --> 01:06:25.965
Oh, yeah, cinematography's unreal.

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:27.900
It's definitely gonna win Best Picture.

01:06:27.935 --> 01:06:29.400
Yeah. Switch?

01:06:29.435 --> 01:06:31.600
Yeah.

01:06:32.600 --> 01:06:34.565
This is disgusting.

01:06:34.600 --> 01:06:36.700
It stinks in here. Come on, I was wrong.

01:06:36.735 --> 01:06:37.964
Let's go.

01:06:37.965 --> 01:06:37.965
Hey.

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:40.550
Do you mind if I suck on your balls?

01:06:40.585 --> 01:06:43.100
I'm gonna see how this plays out.

01:06:43.135 --> 01:06:44.465
I'm going.

01:06:44.500 --> 01:06:46.265
Oh, here we go.

01:06:46.300 --> 01:06:48.365
I'll get your name in due course.

01:06:48.400 --> 01:06:51.500
♪ I'm fresh, I'm fly, I'm so damn high ♪

01:06:51.535 --> 01:06:52.765
Mr. McAllister.

01:06:52.800 --> 01:06:55.200
Mandy, this is quite a
gathering you got cooking here.

01:06:55.235 --> 01:06:56.465
I'm a little surprised.

01:06:56.500 --> 01:06:59.200
It's a little late for
the chess club to be out!

01:06:59.235 --> 01:07:00.617
Come on, what do we got here?

01:07:00.652 --> 01:07:01.926
A little weed, little tequila.

01:07:01.961 --> 01:07:03.230
Where's the hard stuff, pussies?

01:07:03.265 --> 01:07:04.500
Oh, my God, are you guys twins?

01:07:04.535 --> 01:07:05.565
Yes.

01:07:05.600 --> 01:07:07.200
Oh, my gosh, I can't
even tell you guys apart.

01:07:07.235 --> 01:07:08.465
I'm kidding! I'm kidding!

01:07:08.500 --> 01:07:10.465
Slow down! You kids
are out of your mind!

01:07:10.500 --> 01:07:12.450
It's, like, I feel like
the three of us just met,

01:07:12.485 --> 01:07:14.400
but I feel like I'm the
triplet in a weird way,

01:07:14.435 --> 01:07:15.967
but in, like, like, in a sexual way.

01:07:16.002 --> 01:07:17.465
Like, where do we take it from here?

01:07:17.500 --> 01:07:19.800
I'm located about 45
minutes south of here.

01:07:19.835 --> 01:07:21.065
I live with my mom.

01:07:21.100 --> 01:07:22.700
Look, I'm not here
to break up the party.

01:07:22.735 --> 01:07:24.699
I want you kids to get hopped up.

01:07:24.700 --> 01:07:26.800
But I'm looking for
a Chelsea McAllister.

01:07:26.835 --> 01:07:28.165
Anyone here know where she might be?

01:07:28.200 --> 01:07:29.900
You guys know who I'm
talking about, right?

01:07:35.500 --> 01:07:39.500
Maybe we should
go back to the party.

01:07:39.535 --> 01:07:40.465
No.

01:07:40.500 --> 01:07:41.800
I want to keep doing this.

01:07:42.900 --> 01:07:46.100
Okay, I just think we're
going a little fast.

01:07:46.135 --> 01:07:47.565
We're not.

01:07:47.600 --> 01:07:48.565
This is amazing.

01:07:48.600 --> 01:07:51.200
We should keep moving
at this exact pace.

01:07:51.235 --> 01:07:53.067
Maybe even a little bit faster.

01:07:53.102 --> 01:07:54.900
Okay, seriously, Jason, stop it.

01:07:54.935 --> 01:07:55.967
Seriously, Chelsea,

01:07:56.002 --> 01:07:57.000
I don't want to.

01:07:57.035 --> 01:07:58.067
Chelsea?

01:07:58.102 --> 01:07:59.065
Dad?

01:07:59.100 --> 01:08:00.964
What are you doing here?

01:08:00.965 --> 01:08:00.965
What the hell?!

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:03.000
Dude, get out of here!

01:08:03.035 --> 01:08:04.067
Let's just go.

01:08:04.102 --> 01:08:05.251
Are you okay?

01:08:05.286 --> 01:08:06.400
Ruining this.

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:09.500
Catch you later, Chelse.

01:08:09.535 --> 01:08:11.700
Oh, shit.

01:08:11.735 --> 01:08:13.065
Hey!

01:08:13.100 --> 01:08:14.965
Hey, jackass!

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:16.765
I'm talking to you, prick!

01:08:16.800 --> 01:08:19.000
You think you're cute, you little fuck?!

01:08:19.035 --> 01:08:19.899
Oh, my God!

01:08:22.800 --> 01:08:23.765
Ouch.

01:08:23.800 --> 01:08:27.000
That looks like a real gusher, Bob.

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:30.600
Come here, come here!

01:08:30.635 --> 01:08:31.700
Dad!

01:08:33.700 --> 01:08:35.600
Dad!

01:08:36.800 --> 01:08:37.965
Oh, my God.

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:39.465
Are you okay, Dad?

01:08:39.500 --> 01:08:40.899
I'm okay. It just stung a little bit.

01:08:44.899 --> 01:08:46.550
You don't fuck with Bob.

01:08:46.585 --> 01:08:47.942
You show Bob respect.

01:08:47.977 --> 01:08:49.265
Okay.

01:08:49.300 --> 01:08:51.000
Bob's my special guy.

01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:56.265
That's right.

01:08:56.300 --> 01:08:58.064
That's right, that just happened.

01:08:58.100 --> 01:08:59.850
You don't tell your parents about this.

01:08:59.885 --> 01:09:01.564
You don't tell your friends about this.

01:09:01.600 --> 01:09:04.300
You write it in your dream
journal, you lock it up,

01:09:04.335 --> 01:09:06.300
and you put it under your pillow.

01:09:06.335 --> 01:09:07.465
I will come back here

01:09:07.500 --> 01:09:09.600
and I will kill each
and every one of you!

01:09:11.600 --> 01:09:13.600
Except for those two hot
girls I was talking to.

01:09:13.635 --> 01:09:15.167
They have my information,
please have them

01:09:15.202 --> 01:09:16.700
get in contact with me; They seem great.

01:09:16.734 --> 01:09:18.800
No, I'm glad you showed up tonight.

01:09:18.835 --> 01:09:19.865
I'm sorry.

01:09:19.899 --> 01:09:21.865
It's okay, honey.

01:09:21.899 --> 01:09:23.500
Come on, let's go home.

01:09:23.535 --> 01:09:24.399
Okay.

01:09:34.399 --> 01:09:35.465
Daddy?

01:09:35.500 --> 01:09:37.100
I'm okay, honey. I think you got it all.

01:09:37.135 --> 01:09:38.817
You can put it away.

01:09:38.852 --> 01:09:40.500
You doing all right?

01:09:39.865 --> 01:09:39.865
Good.

01:09:39.899 --> 01:09:42.000
Hey, Bob, can I talk
to you for a second?

01:09:42.035 --> 01:09:42.899
Yeah, sure.

01:09:44.899 --> 01:09:46.500
Okay, honey, I'll be in in a second.

01:09:46.535 --> 01:09:47.265
All right.

01:09:47.300 --> 01:09:48.950
I love you so much.

01:09:48.984 --> 01:09:50.600
I love you, too.

01:09:51.600 --> 01:09:53.265
I appreciate you showing up.

01:09:53.300 --> 01:09:56.150
I know it takes a big man to apologize.

01:09:56.185 --> 01:09:59.000
What happened back there was not cool.

01:09:59.035 --> 01:10:00.265
You abandoned your post.

01:10:00.300 --> 01:10:02.900
If that had been an alien
hive, we would have been killed.

01:10:02.935 --> 01:10:03.967
So, it wasn't a hive?

01:10:04.002 --> 01:10:04.965
Where's Jamarcus?

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:06.500
Jamarcus decided to stay at Paul's.

01:10:06.535 --> 01:10:07.965
And no, it wasn't a hive.

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:10.364
It turned out to be a local orgy.

01:10:10.365 --> 01:10:10.365
What?

01:10:10.400 --> 01:10:12.565
There's an orgy happening? Locally?

01:10:12.600 --> 01:10:15.200
So, wait, y-you're mad
at me for leaving an orgy?

01:10:15.235 --> 01:10:16.265
Doesn't matter what it was.

01:10:16.300 --> 01:10:17.900
The point is you left us hanging.

01:10:17.935 --> 01:10:18.965
It's the principle.

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:20.350
No, the principle is I went to go

01:10:20.385 --> 01:10:21.665
help my daughter who was in trouble.

01:10:21.700 --> 01:10:23.800
Evan, you can't be such
a control freak, man.

01:10:23.835 --> 01:10:25.417
You're too uptight.

01:10:25.452 --> 01:10:26.965
Yeah, Bob, I'm uptight.

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:28.265
I'm uptight about the aliens

01:10:28.300 --> 01:10:30.300
that are killing people
in our neighborhood.

01:10:30.335 --> 01:10:31.965
That's what I'm uptight about.

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:33.365
Neighborhood Watch isn't for people

01:10:33.400 --> 01:10:35.500
who can't handle their
daughter's personal shit.

01:10:35.535 --> 01:10:37.317
Do you even hear how
you sound right now?

01:10:37.352 --> 01:10:39.100
Why don't you look at
your own personal life,

01:10:39.135 --> 01:10:40.200
Evan, 'cause you don't even have one.

01:10:40.235 --> 01:10:41.767
You don't talk to your wife.

01:10:41.802 --> 01:10:43.300
You don't have any friends.

01:10:43.335 --> 01:10:44.117
I have friends.

01:10:44.152 --> 01:10:45.026
No, you don't, man.

01:10:45.061 --> 01:10:45.865
I have tons of friends.

01:10:45.900 --> 01:10:47.165
No, you don't. You have clubs.

01:10:47.200 --> 01:10:48.200
You start these clubs!
That's what you do!

01:10:48.235 --> 01:10:49.265
And you become a dictator!

01:10:49.300 --> 01:10:50.865
You just boss everyone
and tell them what to do

01:10:50.900 --> 01:10:52.500
because you're running away
from what really matters.

01:10:52.535 --> 01:10:53.817
You don't have the guts to deal with

01:10:53.852 --> 01:10:55.100
what's going on in your own home.

01:10:55.135 --> 01:10:57.065
Yeah, well...

01:10:57.100 --> 01:10:59.300
I have the guts to do this.

01:10:59.335 --> 01:11:01.465
You're out of the Watch.

01:11:01.500 --> 01:11:04.000
You can't throw me out of the Watch.

01:11:04.035 --> 01:11:05.565
I just did.

01:11:05.600 --> 01:11:06.800
Okay. You know what? I don't care.

01:11:06.835 --> 01:11:08.800
I'm gonna start my own watch.

01:11:08.065 --> 01:11:08.065
You know what?

01:11:08.100 --> 01:11:09.900
You can't, because
there already is a watch!

01:11:09.935 --> 01:11:10.965
So you can't do that.

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:12.600
Oh, yes, I can start my watch,

01:11:12.700 --> 01:11:14.650
'cause if I'm not in your watch,

01:11:14.685 --> 01:11:16.492
you can't give me rules anymore.

01:11:16.527 --> 01:11:18.413
I'm gonna keep my own logo, too.

01:11:18.448 --> 01:11:20.300
I never liked that logo anyway.

01:11:20.335 --> 01:11:21.617
My logo is awesome!

01:11:21.652 --> 01:11:22.865
My logo is "Chinee."

01:11:22.900 --> 01:11:25.100
The "Chinee" understand movement,

01:11:25.135 --> 01:11:26.965
and I understand the Chinese.

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:31.400
I combined flight with
flames with a tiger.

01:11:31.435 --> 01:11:33.100
What am I combining, Evan?

01:11:33.135 --> 01:11:34.165
Serenity,

01:11:34.200 --> 01:11:37.565
optimism, attack!

01:11:37.600 --> 01:11:40.600
Franklin, let's get
some pudding inside you.

01:11:40.635 --> 01:11:42.200
Franklin, you do not go in that house!

01:11:42.235 --> 01:11:44.300
Jesus, Evan, you don't own him.

01:11:44.335 --> 01:11:45.900
You don't own all of us.

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:47.665
Franklin is his own man.

01:11:47.700 --> 01:11:49.300
He can make his own decisions.

01:11:49.335 --> 01:11:50.865
He can think for himself.

01:11:50.900 --> 01:11:52.700
Now, Franklin, get your
fucking ass in the house!

01:11:52.735 --> 01:11:54.400
Don't you speak with Franklin!

01:11:54.435 --> 01:11:55.667
Franklin, you stay!

01:11:55.702 --> 01:11:56.865
Franklin, stay!

01:11:56.900 --> 01:11:58.300
Come! Franklin, come!

01:11:58.335 --> 01:11:59.765
Come here!

01:11:59.800 --> 01:12:02.200
Frank, come here, come
here, come here, Franklin.

01:12:02.235 --> 01:12:04.217
Come here, Franklin.

01:12:04.252 --> 01:12:06.200
Franklin, look at me.

01:12:06.235 --> 01:12:07.165
Franklin.

01:12:07.200 --> 01:12:08.365
Franklin, come on.

01:12:08.400 --> 01:12:10.300
Evan, you're a special friend...

01:12:12.300 --> 01:12:14.300
but I live here.

01:12:22.300 --> 01:12:26.100
How's it feel, Evan,
to be in a club of one?

01:12:47.800 --> 01:12:49.200
Maybe he's jacking off too much.

01:12:49.165 --> 01:12:49.165
No.

01:12:49.200 --> 01:12:50.365
You know what I mean?

01:12:50.400 --> 01:12:52.400
Like, the well is dry
by the time you get home.

01:12:52.365 --> 01:12:52.365
Stop.

01:12:52.400 --> 01:12:53.500
Well, I don't know.

01:12:53.600 --> 01:12:54.665
Have you noticed, like,

01:12:54.700 --> 01:12:57.200
any abrasions or signs
of stress on his penis?

01:12:57.235 --> 01:12:58.565
Abrasions? No.

01:12:58.600 --> 01:13:00.900
Well, like, he's pulling on it too hard.

01:13:02.200 --> 01:13:04.150
I'm sterile.

01:13:04.185 --> 01:13:06.100
Bye-bye.

01:13:09.100 --> 01:13:11.300
- Hey, Carla.
- Hey.

01:13:11.335 --> 01:13:13.465
Honey, I can't have kids.

01:13:13.500 --> 01:13:16.300
I went to a doctor
and got it checked out.

01:13:16.335 --> 01:13:18.465
And I am barren.

01:13:18.500 --> 01:13:20.265
It's me, it's not you.

01:13:20.300 --> 01:13:21.865
It's not the both of us, it's me.

01:13:21.900 --> 01:13:25.250
And I've been trying to
tell you, but just every time

01:13:25.285 --> 01:13:28.600
you wanted to have sex, it
was all I could think about.

01:13:28.635 --> 01:13:31.300
And I didn't know how
to tell you, so I...

01:13:34.300 --> 01:13:36.265
I mean, I mean, why?

01:13:36.300 --> 01:13:37.900
Why wouldn't you tell me?

01:13:37.935 --> 01:13:39.465
Isn't that the kind of thing

01:13:39.500 --> 01:13:42.865
that couples figure out together?

01:13:42.900 --> 01:13:46.700
I just knew how much
you wanted this, and...

01:13:48.700 --> 01:13:50.700
I didn't want to let you down.

01:13:50.735 --> 01:13:53.317
Yeah, but I want this.

01:13:53.352 --> 01:13:55.976
More than anything.

01:13:56.011 --> 01:13:58.565
And... I don't know,

01:13:58.600 --> 01:14:02.350
we can figure all that other stuff out.

01:14:02.385 --> 01:14:06.100
All I ever wanted was
for us to be a team.

01:14:06.135 --> 01:14:09.200
That's all I ever wanted.

01:14:09.235 --> 01:14:10.465
Honey, oh...

01:14:10.500 --> 01:14:11.900
No more secrets, okay?

01:14:13.900 --> 01:14:15.265
Actually...

01:14:15.300 --> 01:14:19.500
there is one more secret.

01:14:19.535 --> 01:14:22.300
Okay.

01:14:27.065 --> 01:14:27.065
Hey, Evan.

01:14:27.100 --> 01:14:30.000
Jamarcus, you know what,
now's not a good time.

01:14:30.035 --> 01:14:31.465
Okay, well, I need
to tell you something.

01:14:31.500 --> 01:14:33.900
I know. I just need to
be with my wife right now.

01:14:33.935 --> 01:14:35.217
This is more important.

01:14:35.252 --> 01:14:36.500
Whatever it is, it isn't.

01:14:36.535 --> 01:14:37.665
Trust me.

01:14:37.700 --> 01:14:39.850
We need to get the
Neighborhood Watch together now.

01:14:39.885 --> 01:14:42.000
Do you want another one?
That gonna hold you over?

01:14:42.035 --> 01:14:43.800
I'll eat more pudding if you have more.

01:14:46.800 --> 01:14:49.100
I don't know that I'm
open to an apology yet.

01:14:49.135 --> 01:14:50.665
You serious?

01:14:50.700 --> 01:14:52.900
Jamarcus, what's going on?

01:14:56.285 --> 01:14:57.600
The fuck?

01:14:59.600 --> 01:15:01.500
Oh, my God.

01:15:02.500 --> 01:15:03.900
Is that a... like, a parlor trick?

01:15:03.935 --> 01:15:06.217
It's okay. It's okay.

01:15:06.252 --> 01:15:08.500
Touch my goo, Bob.

01:15:12.500 --> 01:15:13.665
Feels like cum.

01:15:13.700 --> 01:15:15.664
Holy fuck, it feels like cum!

01:15:15.665 --> 01:15:15.665
What?

01:15:15.700 --> 01:15:17.765
He's a fucking alien!

01:15:17.800 --> 01:15:19.650
You stay the fuck back, Jamarcus!

01:15:19.685 --> 01:15:21.242
All right, what the hell is going on?

01:15:21.277 --> 01:15:22.765
Franklin, I'm not here to hurt you.

01:15:22.800 --> 01:15:24.800
Believe me, I've had
many chances to kill you.

01:15:25.800 --> 01:15:26.900
You're one of them?

01:15:28.900 --> 01:15:30.965
You're an alien?

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:33.000
Look, our ship came here six months ago,

01:15:33.035 --> 01:15:35.065
and we've been hiding ever since.

01:15:35.100 --> 01:15:38.900
We inhabited your human form
to infiltrate your society

01:15:38.935 --> 01:15:41.265
and learn your
weaknesses, but instead...

01:15:41.300 --> 01:15:43.700
Why is this thing still
talking? Let's kill him.

01:15:43.735 --> 01:15:46.065
Because, in a few hours,

01:15:46.100 --> 01:15:48.065
our transmitter will become operational.

01:15:48.100 --> 01:15:52.500
When it signals, our armada
will commence a global invasion

01:15:52.535 --> 01:15:55.400
starting here in
Glenview, which is clearly

01:15:55.435 --> 01:15:57.400
not ideal for you.

01:15:57.435 --> 01:15:57.450
What?

01:15:57.465 --> 01:15:57.485
Why?

01:15:57.500 --> 01:15:59.065
We're aliens.

01:15:59.100 --> 01:16:01.400
That's we do... we come to planets,

01:16:01.435 --> 01:16:03.300
we destroy them, we move on.

01:16:03.335 --> 01:16:05.165
Wait a minute.

01:16:05.200 --> 01:16:07.000
Did you kill Antonio?

01:16:07.035 --> 01:16:08.765
No. God, of course not.

01:16:08.800 --> 01:16:11.200
I know who did. His name's Flertrok.

01:16:11.235 --> 01:16:13.365
The man is a fucking cunt.

01:16:13.400 --> 01:16:15.665
Where is this transmitter thing?

01:16:15.700 --> 01:16:18.400
The only place big enough
with enough power and supplies.

01:16:20.400 --> 01:16:21.900
Costco?

01:16:21.935 --> 01:16:23.365
Yeah.

01:16:23.400 --> 01:16:26.100
You've been planning an
alien invasion in my Costco?

01:16:26.135 --> 01:16:28.800
You really do have everything
you need under one roof.

01:16:28.835 --> 01:16:30.065
Why are you telling us this

01:16:30.100 --> 01:16:31.865
if we don't have any time to stop it?

01:16:31.900 --> 01:16:33.700
What kind of sick fucking
head game are you playing?

01:16:33.735 --> 01:16:35.717
Well, because there's good news.

01:16:35.752 --> 01:16:37.700
If you leave now, you will survive

01:16:37.735 --> 01:16:39.165
the initial invasion,

01:16:39.200 --> 01:16:41.265
and after that, if
you take to the desert

01:16:41.300 --> 01:16:44.200
and live in caves and crevices,
you could, you know, live

01:16:44.235 --> 01:16:46.700
with moderate dignity
for most of your lives.

01:16:46.735 --> 01:16:48.700
I don't believe a word he's saying.

01:16:48.735 --> 01:16:50.265
He betrayed the Watch.

01:16:50.300 --> 01:16:52.265
Yes, but since then, I've come to know

01:16:52.300 --> 01:16:56.100
humanity's compassion and...
and beauty and... and love.

01:16:56.135 --> 01:16:58.365
I don't want to lie anymore.

01:16:58.400 --> 01:17:01.300
And also, the ball sucking
was a real eye opener.

01:17:01.335 --> 01:17:02.865
Look, I'm not going to ask

01:17:02.900 --> 01:17:06.300
for your forgiveness,
because I don't deserve it.

01:17:07.300 --> 01:17:08.600
I'm really sorry.

01:17:09.900 --> 01:17:11.650
Just go.

01:17:11.685 --> 01:17:13.400
Okay.

01:17:17.400 --> 01:17:18.750
Please, save yourselves

01:17:18.785 --> 01:17:20.100
while there's still time.

01:17:23.100 --> 01:17:24.565
What the hell is happening?

01:17:24.600 --> 01:17:26.300
Well, if we don't leave here right now,

01:17:26.335 --> 01:17:27.265
we're going to die.

01:17:27.300 --> 01:17:28.265
Guys, are you actually talking

01:17:28.300 --> 01:17:29.600
about giving up and leaving Glenview?

01:17:29.635 --> 01:17:30.967
No, I think we go and...

01:17:31.002 --> 01:17:32.265
and alert the authorities,

01:17:32.300 --> 01:17:34.100
get as many people out as possible.

01:17:34.135 --> 01:17:35.265
And then what?

01:17:35.300 --> 01:17:36.300
And then... I don't know.

01:17:36.335 --> 01:17:37.265
Evan's right.

01:17:37.300 --> 01:17:38.965
We need to hit the caves.

01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:41.050
Guys, we're not going to let
Glenview become ground zero

01:17:41.085 --> 01:17:43.100
for an alien invasion and
not do something about it.

01:17:43.135 --> 01:17:45.100
We're the Neighborhood Watch.

01:17:45.135 --> 01:17:46.617
This is what we do.

01:17:46.652 --> 01:17:48.065
No, Bob, come on.

01:17:48.100 --> 01:17:49.750
It's what we did... or never really did,

01:17:49.785 --> 01:17:51.400
because we didn't really do anything.

01:17:51.435 --> 01:17:52.465
Until now.

01:17:52.500 --> 01:17:53.865
I say, tonight, we change that.

01:17:53.900 --> 01:17:55.500
Evan, you started the neighborhood watch

01:17:55.535 --> 01:17:56.800
because you believed in something.

01:17:56.835 --> 01:17:58.467
You believed in this town.

01:17:58.502 --> 01:18:00.065
You believed in these people.

01:18:00.100 --> 01:18:01.600
You believed in us.
And damn it, I still do.

01:18:01.635 --> 01:18:03.467
We're not going to let a bunch of aliens

01:18:03.502 --> 01:18:05.300
waltz in here and do whatever the hell

01:18:05.335 --> 01:18:06.365
they want to do.

01:18:06.400 --> 01:18:07.765
I say, not on our watch.

01:18:07.800 --> 01:18:10.300
I say they drew the short
straw when they picked Glenview.

01:18:10.335 --> 01:18:11.465
Now, come on, guys,

01:18:11.500 --> 01:18:12.865
and get your heads right.

01:18:12.900 --> 01:18:16.350
This neighborhood's going
to need our best tonight.

01:18:16.385 --> 01:18:19.800
Evan, some aliens just
set up tents in your store.

01:18:19.835 --> 01:18:22.600
What do you want to do about it?

01:18:23.600 --> 01:18:26.500
Costco is for members only.

01:18:28.500 --> 01:18:29.800
Let's take out that transmitter.

01:18:29.835 --> 01:18:31.767
Now we're talking.

01:18:31.802 --> 01:18:33.700
All right, Watch.

01:18:33.735 --> 01:18:35.465
This is it.

01:18:35.500 --> 01:18:36.865
Now it gets real.

01:18:36.900 --> 01:18:38.465
That's a cute ten-milly Beretta, Bobby.

01:18:38.500 --> 01:18:42.100
But I say we make a little
pit stop at my house.

01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:55.950
♪ I was a moving man ♪

01:18:55.985 --> 01:18:58.865
♪ In my younger days... ♪

01:18:58.900 --> 01:19:01.400
Welcome to the candy
shop, motherfuckers.

01:19:01.435 --> 01:19:02.000
Jesus.

01:19:02.035 --> 01:19:02.565
Nice.

01:19:02.600 --> 01:19:04.350
Holy shit.

01:19:04.385 --> 01:19:06.100
Ladies first.

01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:09.400
This one looks cute.

01:19:09.435 --> 01:19:12.117
Cute and deadly.

01:19:12.152 --> 01:19:13.899
Just like me.

01:19:13.900 --> 01:19:15.400
Franklin, what are you doing?

01:19:15.435 --> 01:19:16.665
Who are these people?

01:19:16.700 --> 01:19:17.865
And what are you doing with these guns?

01:19:17.900 --> 01:19:20.000
Goddamn it, Mom, stay
the fuck out of my room!

01:19:20.035 --> 01:19:21.517
I don't go through your shit!

01:19:21.552 --> 01:19:23.000
I don't touch your butterflies!

01:19:23.035 --> 01:19:24.265
Franklin.

01:19:24.300 --> 01:19:25.900
Stay the fuck out. All right,
everyone out of my room.

01:19:25.935 --> 01:19:27.065
Everyone out of my room.

01:19:27.100 --> 01:19:28.900
Everyone leave. Everyone
leave. Everyone out.

01:19:28.935 --> 01:19:30.700
- I got shit I have to do.
- Nice to meet you.

01:19:30.735 --> 01:19:31.800
Politeness, yeah.

01:19:31.835 --> 01:19:32.865
It was a pleasure.

01:19:32.900 --> 01:19:33.965
I'm sorry, Mama.

01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:35.500
I was trying to impress my friends.

01:19:35.535 --> 01:19:36.865
I was trying to be a big man.

01:19:36.900 --> 01:19:39.700
I love you. Stay inside
the house tonight, okay?

01:19:39.735 --> 01:19:41.265
What...

01:19:41.300 --> 01:19:43.800
You're an angel.

01:19:50.400 --> 01:19:51.965
<i>Glenview PD.</i>

01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:53.864
<i>This is Sergeant Bressman.</i>

01:19:53.865 --> 01:19:53.865
<i>Bressman?</i>

01:19:53.900 --> 01:19:56.250
It's Evan Trautwig. Listen
to me very carefully.

01:19:56.285 --> 01:19:58.565
There is an alien invasion
happening at the Costco.

01:19:58.600 --> 01:20:01.700
I know it sounds crazy, but you
got to get down there right now.

01:20:01.735 --> 01:20:02.867
Oh, an alien invasion?

01:20:02.902 --> 01:20:03.965
Really? At-at Costco?

01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:06.400
Right now? Oh, great, I'm on my way.

01:20:06.435 --> 01:20:07.765
Oh, wait, no, I'm not.

01:20:07.800 --> 01:20:10.365
I'm still here for some reason.

01:20:10.400 --> 01:20:11.800
Give me the phone. Give me the phone.

01:20:11.835 --> 01:20:13.665
Bressman, you were right.

01:20:13.700 --> 01:20:14.765
Trautwig is the Costco killer.

01:20:14.800 --> 01:20:16.650
He's going to take
us to Costco right now

01:20:16.685 --> 01:20:18.500
and kill us. You got to help us.

01:20:18.535 --> 01:20:19.800
He's coming.

01:20:19.835 --> 01:20:20.367
Really?

01:20:20.402 --> 01:20:20.865
Yeah.

01:20:20.900 --> 01:20:22.200
He believed that?

01:20:38.600 --> 01:20:39.965
Look.

01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:42.200
Oh, my God. That's an alien.

01:20:42.235 --> 01:20:43.665
I...

01:20:43.700 --> 01:20:45.564
I'm looking at an alien.

01:20:45.565 --> 01:20:45.565
I know.

01:20:45.600 --> 01:20:47.065
It can be a total mind-fuck.

01:20:47.100 --> 01:20:49.100
What do we do, bust in the
front door, guns blazing?

01:20:49.135 --> 01:20:51.300
I love the enthusiasm, Frank 'n' Beans,

01:20:51.335 --> 01:20:52.617
but I think we're going to need

01:20:52.652 --> 01:20:53.865
a different kind of strategy here.

01:20:53.900 --> 01:20:56.465
There's only one way
underneath the store.

01:20:56.500 --> 01:20:59.600
It's through the drainage
grate in frozen foods.

01:20:59.635 --> 01:21:01.667
When we rebuilt the tire section,

01:21:01.702 --> 01:21:03.700
we put shelving over the trash chute,

01:21:03.735 --> 01:21:06.400
but we never sealed it off.

01:21:07.400 --> 01:21:09.500
Stay behind me.

01:21:12.500 --> 01:21:13.900
Let's go.

01:21:16.900 --> 01:21:18.800
Pop this bitch open.

01:21:18.835 --> 01:21:22.365
I'll cover you.

01:21:22.400 --> 01:21:24.600
Come on, let's go, guys.
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

01:21:24.635 --> 01:21:26.200
I can't...

01:21:27.400 --> 01:21:30.800
Do you have nails? Do you have nails?

01:21:51.300 --> 01:21:53.900
He's guarding the grate.
Are you guys in position?

01:21:53.935 --> 01:21:56.265
In position.

01:21:56.300 --> 01:21:58.600
This is exciting.

01:21:58.635 --> 01:22:00.065
Okay.

01:22:00.100 --> 01:22:01.500
All right, we shoot him on three.

01:22:01.535 --> 01:22:04.200
I repeat... shoot on three.

01:22:04.235 --> 01:22:06.317
One. Two.

01:22:06.352 --> 01:22:08.365
Three!

01:22:08.400 --> 01:22:10.800
Freeze, Trautwig.

01:22:10.835 --> 01:22:12.265
Game over.

01:22:12.300 --> 01:22:13.864
Where'd it go? Did you see it?

01:22:13.865 --> 01:22:13.865
I don't know.

01:22:13.900 --> 01:22:15.900
You're under arrest for the
murder of Manfred Salisbury,

01:22:15.935 --> 01:22:16.900
Antonio Guzman

01:22:17.200 --> 01:22:18.964
And that little punk skater kid.

01:22:18.965 --> 01:22:18.965
Shut up.

01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:20.265
Drop the guns.

01:22:20.300 --> 01:22:21.500
You don't understand what's happening.

01:22:21.535 --> 01:22:23.500
There's aliens in the store.

01:22:23.535 --> 01:22:23.665
Oh, yeah?

01:22:23.700 --> 01:22:25.065
Aliens? Where?

01:22:25.100 --> 01:22:27.000
It was right over there
until you scared it.

01:22:27.035 --> 01:22:28.065
Now, keep your mouth down.

01:22:28.100 --> 01:22:29.800
Oh, aliens who are scared by the sound

01:22:29.835 --> 01:22:30.917
of a door opening.

01:22:30.952 --> 01:22:31.965
Look out, Earth.

01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:33.100
You've met your match.

01:22:33.135 --> 01:22:33.715
Drop the guns!

01:22:33.750 --> 01:22:34.365
No, we're not

01:22:34.400 --> 01:22:36.300
going to drop our guns,
because there are aliens here.

01:22:36.335 --> 01:22:38.167
Chucho, what's up, buddy?

01:22:38.202 --> 01:22:40.000
You got something to say?

01:22:41.400 --> 01:22:44.400
Oh, what the fuck is that thing?

01:22:46.500 --> 01:22:47.400
No.

01:22:50.700 --> 01:22:51.700
No!

01:22:53.700 --> 01:22:55.150
Fuck! Fuck!

01:22:55.185 --> 01:22:56.565
Shit! Oh!

01:22:56.600 --> 01:22:58.600
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck!

01:23:03.600 --> 01:23:04.865
Chucho.

01:23:04.900 --> 01:23:07.065
Oh, Chucho, Chucho.

01:23:07.100 --> 01:23:09.500
Oh, stay with me, buddy.

01:23:09.535 --> 01:23:10.565
Stay with me.

01:23:10.600 --> 01:23:12.000
Oh, no, no, no, Chucho.

01:23:12.035 --> 01:23:13.267
Come on, come on, come on.

01:23:13.302 --> 01:23:15.401
Come on, stay with me.

01:23:15.436 --> 01:23:17.064
Stay with me. Come on.

01:23:17.065 --> 01:23:17.065
His...

01:23:17.100 --> 01:23:18.650
his heart is out of his body, fella.

01:23:18.685 --> 01:23:20.292
I don't think he's going to make it.

01:23:20.327 --> 01:23:21.900
What? No, no, he's going to make it.

01:23:21.935 --> 01:23:23.600
Come on! Come on!

01:23:23.635 --> 01:23:25.165
Listen, cop!

01:23:25.200 --> 01:23:27.300
You got a lot of shit you
need to brought up to speed on,

01:23:27.335 --> 01:23:28.717
and I, for one, don't
have the goddamn time

01:23:28.752 --> 01:23:30.100
to hold your hand and
walk you through it.

01:23:30.135 --> 01:23:31.800
First, aliens exist.

01:23:31.835 --> 01:23:33.265
Deal with it.

01:23:33.300 --> 01:23:35.300
Second, your boy Chuch,
here, is dead as fuck.

01:23:35.335 --> 01:23:37.300
And there ain't nothing
on God's green Earth

01:23:37.335 --> 01:23:38.565
that's going to bring him back to us.

01:23:38.600 --> 01:23:40.900
Now, I have a bunch of
aliens underneath this Costco,

01:23:40.935 --> 01:23:43.000
and we are moments away from this Earth

01:23:43.035 --> 01:23:44.865
being stomped a new asshole.

01:23:44.900 --> 01:23:46.165
Now, I have one important question,

01:23:46.200 --> 01:23:48.600
and I need you to answer
it for me right now.

01:23:48.635 --> 01:23:50.567
Are you with us?

01:23:50.602 --> 01:23:52.465
Are you a cop?

01:23:52.500 --> 01:23:55.165
No. You rejected me.

01:23:55.200 --> 01:23:57.550
'Cause I was too awesome for you.

01:23:57.585 --> 01:23:59.492
Well, that was clearly the biggest

01:23:59.527 --> 01:24:01.400
goddamn mistake I've ever made.

01:24:01.500 --> 01:24:03.500
I'll do whatever you say, kid.

01:24:03.535 --> 01:24:05.365
Lock and load, bitches.

01:24:05.400 --> 01:24:07.465
Anything from outer space, kill it.

01:24:07.500 --> 01:24:11.700
Come on. That alien was
guarding that grate for a reason.

01:24:28.600 --> 01:24:31.065
Die! Die!

01:24:31.100 --> 01:24:33.900
You... killed... my... friend!

01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:35.765
You stupid Flertrok!

01:24:35.800 --> 01:24:37.800
I don't know if we can confirm or deny

01:24:37.835 --> 01:24:39.017
whether or not that's Flertrok,

01:24:39.052 --> 01:24:40.200
but this thing's a goner for sure.

01:24:51.200 --> 01:24:52.200
Oh, it hurts.

01:24:58.800 --> 01:25:02.300
I guess this is the part
where you leave me to die.

01:25:02.335 --> 01:25:03.165
No, no.

01:25:03.200 --> 01:25:04.600
You're not going to die.

01:25:04.635 --> 01:25:05.965
Yeah, you're not going to die.

01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:07.700
He's going to... he's going to die.

01:25:07.735 --> 01:25:09.900
You better get some help.

01:25:11.900 --> 01:25:13.265
That doesn't sound good.

01:25:13.300 --> 01:25:14.700
Come on, we got to
find that transmitter.

01:25:14.735 --> 01:25:16.265
Hey.

01:25:16.300 --> 01:25:18.200
Go kill me some aliens, baby.

01:25:18.235 --> 01:25:20.900
All right.

01:25:20.935 --> 01:25:22.465
Okay.

01:25:22.500 --> 01:25:24.800
Hey. I need you to be
strong for me, okay?

01:25:25.402 --> 01:25:25.633
Okay...

01:25:25.668 --> 01:25:25.865
Franklin.

01:25:25.900 --> 01:25:27.100
What's the deal?

01:25:27.135 --> 01:25:27.967
What are we doing?

01:25:28.002 --> 01:25:28.800
All right, you ready?

01:25:28.765 --> 01:25:28.765
Yeah, okay.

01:25:28.800 --> 01:25:31.300
Okay, I'm just going to lift your arm.

01:25:44.600 --> 01:25:46.800
Here we go.

01:26:02.600 --> 01:26:05.765
Holy shit.

01:26:05.800 --> 01:26:07.100
Gentlemen.

01:26:09.100 --> 01:26:11.400
What the hell are you doing down here?

01:26:11.435 --> 01:26:12.665
Nothing, really.

01:26:12.700 --> 01:26:15.800
Just picking up some
paper towels in bulk.

01:26:15.835 --> 01:26:17.600
Super-big tub of mayo.

01:26:17.635 --> 01:26:18.700
And what else?

01:26:18.735 --> 01:26:19.965
Oh, yeah.

01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:22.400
Transmitting a signal to my armada

01:26:22.435 --> 01:26:24.000
to destroy your entire race.

01:26:24.035 --> 01:26:25.167
Holy shit!

01:26:25.202 --> 01:26:26.265
He's an alien!

01:26:26.300 --> 01:26:28.000
You motherfucker!

01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:33.000
You guys go destroy the transmitter.

01:26:33.035 --> 01:26:34.565
I'll deal with this jackass.

01:26:34.600 --> 01:26:36.150
No. We're not going to
leave you alone with him.

01:26:36.185 --> 01:26:37.700
Goddamn it, Evan, we don't
have time for this shit.

01:26:37.735 --> 01:26:39.565
Just go, go, go, go,
go! I got him. I got him.

01:26:39.600 --> 01:26:41.600
Bob's right. Look, they have
some shit they have to work out.

01:26:41.635 --> 01:26:42.767
Let's just go. Come on.

01:26:42.802 --> 01:26:43.900
Okay, you be careful.

01:26:43.935 --> 01:26:45.817
Okay. Okay, Bob.

01:26:45.852 --> 01:26:47.700
You can do this.

01:26:53.700 --> 01:26:55.200
Come on, Bob.

01:26:55.235 --> 01:26:56.700
This is too easy.

01:27:08.635 --> 01:27:10.200
Yeah!

01:27:11.200 --> 01:27:13.600
God.

01:27:16.600 --> 01:27:18.350
Oh, my God.

01:27:18.385 --> 01:27:19.842
What do we do?

01:27:19.877 --> 01:27:21.300
I have an idea.

01:27:28.300 --> 01:27:30.200
My idea didn't work.

01:27:39.100 --> 01:27:41.400
Evan, they're not dying!

01:27:43.400 --> 01:27:44.500
I'm out of bullets.

01:27:45.500 --> 01:27:47.165
So am I.

01:27:47.200 --> 01:27:48.365
It's going to be an honor

01:27:48.400 --> 01:27:49.900
getting skinned alive next to you.

01:27:54.900 --> 01:27:56.200
What is happening?

01:27:58.400 --> 01:28:00.600
Why are their dicks exploding?

01:28:05.600 --> 01:28:07.265
Hi.

01:28:07.300 --> 01:28:08.900
That's the only way to kill us.

01:28:08.935 --> 01:28:10.500
Severe trauma to the dick.

01:28:11.500 --> 01:28:12.750
That's where our brains are.

01:28:12.785 --> 01:28:13.942
Like all guys. Am I right?

01:28:13.977 --> 01:28:15.065
You know it.

01:28:15.100 --> 01:28:16.065
Bob, come in.

01:28:16.100 --> 01:28:18.100
If you can hear me...

01:28:18.200 --> 01:28:19.365
their weakness is their dick.

01:28:19.400 --> 01:28:21.000
Their Achilles' heel is in their dicks.

01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:24.200
Die!

01:28:43.200 --> 01:28:45.265
Magnum, my ass.

01:28:45.300 --> 01:28:46.900
I only needed one hand for that shit.

01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:52.300
Jamarcus, how do you
shut this thing down?

01:28:52.335 --> 01:28:54.900
Looks like the orb's powering it,

01:28:54.935 --> 01:28:57.000
so maybe removing the orb

01:28:57.035 --> 01:28:58.167
would de-power it?

01:28:58.202 --> 01:28:59.265
You're guessing?

01:28:59.300 --> 01:29:00.700
You seriously don't know
how this thing works?

01:29:00.735 --> 01:29:01.865
I'm not an engineer. I didn't build it.

01:29:01.900 --> 01:29:03.950
I mean, do you know how
your cell phone works?

01:29:03.985 --> 01:29:05.792
Do I... Yes, I know
how my cell phone works.

01:29:05.827 --> 01:29:07.600
You hit a bunch of
numbers and you hit send.

01:29:07.635 --> 01:29:09.100
At least don't you know the basic...?

01:29:09.135 --> 01:29:10.065
What do you mean, the basic?

01:29:10.100 --> 01:29:12.350
Look at it. It's not fucking basic.

01:29:12.385 --> 01:29:14.565
It looks complicated. That light bit.

01:29:14.600 --> 01:29:16.900
See, that light... that means
it's almost charged, right?

01:29:16.935 --> 01:29:18.665
What's happening?

01:29:18.700 --> 01:29:20.300
What the fuck is he doing here?

01:29:20.335 --> 01:29:21.900
Bob, it's all right. We were surrounded,

01:29:21.935 --> 01:29:23.000
and he saved our asses.

01:29:22.965 --> 01:29:22.965
You okay?

01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:24.165
He came in here

01:29:24.200 --> 01:29:25.900
jacking dicks left and right.

01:29:27.400 --> 01:29:29.465
Shit. What is that?

01:29:29.500 --> 01:29:30.900
I'm going to go get that orb thing.

01:29:30.935 --> 01:29:31.900
You guys cover me, all right?

01:29:31.935 --> 01:29:32.565
Yeah, Evaroo.

01:29:32.600 --> 01:29:34.500
Just go quick. Hurry
up. This place sucks.

01:29:34.535 --> 01:29:36.500
I've gone to the other side, guys.

01:29:36.535 --> 01:29:38.065
I'm fucking way in it.

01:29:38.100 --> 01:29:41.000
If first thing in war is
lost is fucking innocence...

01:29:41.035 --> 01:29:43.500
Yeah!

01:29:45.500 --> 01:29:46.950
Better watch it.

01:29:46.985 --> 01:29:48.400
Hurry up, buddy.

01:29:48.435 --> 01:29:50.400
Hurry up.

01:29:54.100 --> 01:29:54.900
It's transmitting!

01:30:00.900 --> 01:30:02.300
Get it off that thing.

01:30:11.365 --> 01:30:12.015
It worked!

01:30:12.050 --> 01:30:12.665
All right.

01:30:12.700 --> 01:30:14.400
Let's get the fuck out of here.

01:30:17.400 --> 01:30:19.200
What is it?

01:30:22.200 --> 01:30:23.800
Franklin!

01:30:26.500 --> 01:30:28.300
Holy shit. Evan, let's go!

01:30:30.800 --> 01:30:33.700
We got to get the orb out of here.

01:30:33.735 --> 01:30:35.165
Cover us. Let's go.

01:30:35.200 --> 01:30:37.800
I got you, Frank 'n' Bean!

01:30:55.600 --> 01:30:57.500
Come on!

01:30:57.535 --> 01:30:59.400
Let's go!

01:31:00.400 --> 01:31:02.200
Get up there, Frank.

01:31:02.235 --> 01:31:03.367
Come on, Evan.

01:31:03.402 --> 01:31:04.465
Move, move, move.

01:31:04.500 --> 01:31:05.800
This place is crawling.

01:31:10.200 --> 01:31:11.765
Jamarcus, give me your hand!

01:31:11.800 --> 01:31:14.000
Just go. Take the orb out and go.

01:31:14.035 --> 01:31:15.465
No Watchman left behind!

01:31:15.500 --> 01:31:17.300
Give me your hand! Come on, pal!

01:31:19.300 --> 01:31:21.164
Come on, brother. Let's go.

01:31:21.165 --> 01:31:21.165
Fridge! Franklin!

01:31:21.200 --> 01:31:22.900
Get up here. Let's go.

01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:31.800
Go! Go! Go! Go!

01:31:37.500 --> 01:31:39.000
Come on, come on! Let's go!

01:31:48.200 --> 01:31:50.000
Franklin, the switch!

01:32:04.300 --> 01:32:06.100
Get back, Abby!

01:32:06.135 --> 01:32:07.165
Abby!

01:32:07.200 --> 01:32:08.400
Take cover!

01:32:10.400 --> 01:32:11.465
Come on, boys!

01:32:11.500 --> 01:32:13.200
Let's plug these motherfucking holes!

01:32:21.500 --> 01:32:24.200
Good-bye, sweet child of mine.

01:32:35.200 --> 01:32:36.500
Evan!

01:33:04.800 --> 01:33:06.200
Wait, what's happening?

01:33:06.235 --> 01:33:07.465
Did we win?

01:33:07.500 --> 01:33:10.100
I can't see. Are those tears of joy?

01:33:10.135 --> 01:33:13.067
They're not tears of joy, are they?

01:33:13.102 --> 01:33:15.701
Oh, no. Your husband's dead, isn't he?

01:33:15.736 --> 01:33:18.300
Your husband's dead. I'm so sorry.

01:33:18.335 --> 01:33:21.600
You're going to find somebody.

01:33:21.635 --> 01:33:22.867
You're a great person.

01:33:22.902 --> 01:33:24.065
Life goes on, though.

01:33:24.100 --> 01:33:25.500
There's always something better

01:33:25.535 --> 01:33:26.565
around the corner.

01:33:26.600 --> 01:33:28.300
That's what my mom always said.

01:33:28.335 --> 01:33:30.300
I'm single, too, actually.

01:33:47.200 --> 01:33:48.500
Hey.

01:33:53.600 --> 01:33:55.100
Your Costco.

01:33:55.135 --> 01:33:56.600
I'm sorry, baby.

01:33:56.635 --> 01:33:58.600
Don't be.

01:33:59.600 --> 01:34:00.865
She'll rise again.

01:34:00.900 --> 01:34:03.665
Like a phoenix from the ashes.

01:34:03.700 --> 01:34:05.400
And when she does, we'll be there.

01:34:08.400 --> 01:34:10.850
We did it, Ev.

01:34:10.885 --> 01:34:13.300
Yeah, we did.

01:34:17.300 --> 01:34:19.765
You came back for us.

01:34:19.800 --> 01:34:22.065
We went to an orgy together.

01:34:22.100 --> 01:34:25.250
We are, like, friends forever now.

01:34:25.285 --> 01:34:28.400
I'll explain that to you later.

01:34:28.435 --> 01:34:29.117
Yeah.

01:34:29.152 --> 01:34:30.226
Okay.

01:34:30.261 --> 01:34:31.265
Hey.

01:34:31.300 --> 01:34:33.400
Listen, I'm sorry about
that stuff I said before.

01:34:33.435 --> 01:34:34.665
Forget it, man.

01:34:34.700 --> 01:34:37.700
I'm really sorry about the
stuff I said, too, but...

01:34:37.735 --> 01:34:39.600
I mean, that's what brothers do.

01:34:39.635 --> 01:34:41.800
They fight.

01:34:42.800 --> 01:34:44.500
But then they always make up, right?

01:34:46.500 --> 01:34:48.000
Are we cool?

01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:51.365
Yeah.

01:34:51.400 --> 01:34:52.665
All right.

01:34:52.700 --> 01:34:54.400
Get in here, little big man.

01:34:54.435 --> 01:34:55.765
That's my guy.

01:34:55.800 --> 01:34:58.400
That was really beautiful, you guys.

01:34:58.435 --> 01:35:00.200
Now do me.

01:35:00.235 --> 01:35:01.265
What?

01:35:01.300 --> 01:35:03.400
Apologize to me.

01:35:03.435 --> 01:35:04.765
For what?

01:35:04.800 --> 01:35:07.200
If I have to tell you, then
the apology is meaningless.

01:35:07.235 --> 01:35:08.764
All right, Frank 'n' Beans.

01:35:08.765 --> 01:35:08.765
Get in here.

01:35:08.800 --> 01:35:10.750
Thank you. Thank you.

01:35:10.785 --> 01:35:12.642
Come on, Jamrock.

01:35:12.677 --> 01:35:14.500
All right, guys.

01:35:15.500 --> 01:35:18.200
Listen, baby, I know things
get tough, but I'm okay.

01:35:18.235 --> 01:35:20.200
Yeah. No, look, I understand.

01:35:20.235 --> 01:35:20.565
You got to stop that.

01:35:20.600 --> 01:35:22.250
Really. What are you doing? Really.

01:35:22.285 --> 01:35:23.992
I'm in a weird place. I'm sorry.

01:35:24.027 --> 01:35:25.665
I don't want to come off

01:35:25.700 --> 01:35:27.200
as kind of a bottom-feeder,
but there could be

01:35:27.235 --> 01:35:28.600
a couple of knickknacks in that store

01:35:28.635 --> 01:35:30.600
that no one's going to miss.

01:35:30.635 --> 01:35:30.650
Don't even finish it.

01:35:30.685 --> 01:35:31.265
What are you doing? No.

01:35:31.300 --> 01:35:33.200
Pick up a couple knickknacks
or something for the...

01:35:33.235 --> 01:35:35.000
That stuff's all covered by insurance.

01:35:35.035 --> 01:35:36.965
You can't... What are you...?

01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:39.400
<i>I used to think I had it all,</i>

01:35:39.435 --> 01:35:40.765
<i>but then I realized:</i>

01:35:40.800 --> 01:35:42.265
<i>What was it all about without friends?</i>

01:35:42.300 --> 01:35:44.900
All right, kids, let's get
in a little tighter here.

01:35:44.935 --> 01:35:46.367
Let's keep the hands above the hips.

01:35:46.402 --> 01:35:47.765
Let's keep it 1950s in this bitch, okay?

01:35:47.800 --> 01:35:51.100
Is it true your dad ripped
your last boyfriend's dick off?

01:35:51.135 --> 01:35:52.465
Yup.

01:35:52.500 --> 01:35:54.264
Hey, you guys be home by midnight.

01:35:54.265 --> 01:35:54.265
I was thinking

01:35:54.300 --> 01:35:56.465
actually 10:30, sir,
if that's okay with you.

01:35:56.500 --> 01:35:58.800
Don't be such a suck-up. What, are
you going to blow me in the driveway?

01:35:58.835 --> 01:36:00.565
Midnight's going to be fine.

01:36:17.700 --> 01:36:18.800

Oh! Where did you come from?

01:36:21.100 --> 01:36:24.565
<i>I now know that we are not alone.</i>

01:36:24.600 --> 01:36:27.400
<i>And I'm feeling pretty good about that.</i>

01:36:27.435 --> 01:36:28.565
