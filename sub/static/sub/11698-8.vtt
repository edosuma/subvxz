WEBVTT

00:01.000 --> 00:02.269
Okay. Saddle up, people!

00:02.269 --> 00:04.003
Megan's gonna be here any minute.

00:04.003 --> 00:06.139
(Western accent) Time to move
'em on up and get 'em on out.

00:07.441 --> 00:09.176
Hold your horses, cowboy.

00:09.176 --> 00:11.311
Well, actually, if you knew how to do that,

00:11.311 --> 00:12.980
we wouldn't have this little buckaroo.

00:15.015 --> 00:16.483
Oh, good. You're home.

00:16.483 --> 00:17.985
No no no no no. Whatever it is,

00:17.985 --> 00:19.119
now is not a good time.

00:19.119 --> 00:20.187
Unless you're leaving.

00:20.187 --> 00:22.055
Because then, now would be a perfect time.

00:22.135 --> 00:25.539
I need someone to talk to about Fitch.

00:25.539 --> 00:26.840
- I'm breaking up with him.
- (Bonnie gasps)

00:26.840 --> 00:28.141
Oh my God. Talk slow.

00:28.141 --> 00:30.711
Don't leave anything out.

00:30.711 --> 00:32.679
What's there to tell? You
already gave away the ending.

00:32.679 --> 00:35.048
You're dumping him. Thanks for stopping by.

00:35.238 --> 00:37.274
He lives in Africa.

00:37.274 --> 00:39.276
What was I thinking?

00:39.276 --> 00:40.377
Gorgeous, smart

00:40.377 --> 00:42.279
and dedicated to helping others.

00:42.279 --> 00:44.414
You're right. You could totally do better.

00:44.414 --> 00:47.484
I know all that.

00:47.484 --> 00:50.353
But it's cancelled out
by that weird giggly laugh

00:50.353 --> 00:52.789
and that stupid feather necklace

00:52.789 --> 00:54.291
he wears all the time.

00:54.291 --> 00:56.393
I mean, it's hideous, right?

00:57.561 --> 00:59.296
(Gasps)

01:02.933 --> 01:04.801
We have nothing in common.

01:04.801 --> 01:08.238
Riley, no one is arguing with you.

01:08.238 --> 01:09.973
So why don't you go call
him and share the news?

01:09.973 --> 01:11.374
I can't,

01:11.374 --> 01:12.642
because he's on some stupid

01:12.642 --> 01:14.811
two-week trek for the orphanage in Africa.

01:14.811 --> 01:16.847
- See? No time for me.
- Yeah.

01:18.471 --> 01:20.707
Hey, Ben.

01:20.707 --> 01:23.176
I really like these new towels you got.

01:23.176 --> 01:24.477
You got to use a lot of them,

01:24.477 --> 01:25.545
but they're super soft.

01:26.713 --> 01:29.115
Those are hand towels!

01:29.115 --> 01:30.884
And they're not for
you. They were for Megan.

01:30.884 --> 01:33.219
I really need everything to be perfect.

01:33.219 --> 01:36.890
Okay, Bromeo, here is my sexy candle.

01:36.890 --> 01:38.024
(Tucker laughs)

01:38.024 --> 01:39.192
One whiff of that

01:39.192 --> 01:42.629
and inhibitions won't be
the only thing dropping.

01:42.629 --> 01:44.998
Oh, so that's what this is all about.

01:44.998 --> 01:46.599
You haven't closed with Megan yet.

01:46.599 --> 01:48.001
I don't know what's wrong.

01:48.001 --> 01:49.436
I've never had this problem before.

01:49.436 --> 01:50.470
Every time I try to make a move,

01:50.470 --> 01:52.906
I get all nervous and flustery.

01:52.906 --> 01:54.207
You sound like a girl.

01:55.642 --> 02:00.213
I mean, you must really like this girl.

02:00.213 --> 02:01.648
Yeah, I do.

02:01.648 --> 02:03.216
But you want to know
what I'd like even more?

02:03.216 --> 02:05.518
For all of you to grab your jackets,

02:05.518 --> 02:07.754
purses, wallets, underage loved ones,

02:07.754 --> 02:09.455
and get out.

02:09.455 --> 02:10.957
Oh, okay.

02:10.957 --> 02:13.059
No, not you, Megan, come on in. Okay.

02:13.059 --> 02:14.427
Hi, everyone.

02:14.427 --> 02:17.030
- Hi, Megan.
- Out. Out. Out.

02:17.030 --> 02:19.165
F.Y.I., we already got one of these.

02:21.468 --> 02:23.803

That was really good.

And I'm really hoping
that that was chicken.

02:37.573 --> 02:39.175
(Laughs)

02:39.175 --> 02:41.010
Well, then if we're both done,

02:41.010 --> 02:43.612
maybe we can move on to the
entertainment portion of the evening.

02:43.612 --> 02:47.283
And what exactly did you have in mind?

02:47.283 --> 02:50.052
How 'bout we call it a surprise?

02:50.052 --> 02:52.555
But just know I did change my sheets.

02:53.889 --> 02:55.824
Ow. (Laughs)

02:55.824 --> 02:57.826
Ow, sorry... teeth.

02:57.826 --> 02:59.161
It's fine. It's fine.

03:05.000 --> 03:06.202
Ow, ow, ow.

03:06.202 --> 03:07.269
My hair. My hair.

03:07.269 --> 03:08.737
I'm sorry. Are you okay?

03:08.737 --> 03:11.774
Yeah, no, I'm fine, but are you okay?

03:11.774 --> 03:13.776
Other than some seriously sweaty palms,

03:13.776 --> 03:15.244
I'm fine.

03:15.244 --> 03:18.113
Okay. Why are you suddenly
so nervous and flustery?

03:18.113 --> 03:20.216
I assume you've done this before?

03:20.216 --> 03:22.484
Done it before?

03:22.484 --> 03:23.786
If I was on my usual schedule,

03:23.786 --> 03:25.788
your bra would have been
off after the eggrolls.

03:25.788 --> 03:29.091
I'm sorry if I'm not inspiring you.

03:29.091 --> 03:30.759
No no no no. Of course,

03:30.759 --> 03:32.094
I'm super inspired.

03:32.094 --> 03:34.063
Trust me it's all I've been thinking about.

03:34.063 --> 03:36.165
Really?

03:36.165 --> 03:38.234
Because what I'm thinking is we
don't seem to have a connection.

03:38.234 --> 03:39.668
But that shouldn't matter.

03:39.668 --> 03:41.136
I've slept with a ton of girls

03:41.136 --> 03:42.671
I'd had almost no
connection with whatsoever.

03:43.906 --> 03:44.940
Oh, wait wait.

03:44.940 --> 03:46.208
Oh, I know what's missing.

03:48.911 --> 03:50.112
Oh. (Laughs)

03:51.580 --> 03:52.648
(Knocking on door)

03:53.749 --> 03:55.684
Breathe deep. I'll be right back.

03:59.655 --> 04:02.491
Riley, kind of busy trying to get busy.

04:02.491 --> 04:03.859
I'm sorry.

04:03.859 --> 04:04.994
I didn't know where else to go.

04:04.994 --> 04:06.595
- What's wrong?
- It's Fitch.

04:06.595 --> 04:08.130
Yeah, got it.

04:08.130 --> 04:09.131
You're breaking up with him.

04:09.131 --> 04:11.233
Hideous laugh... super happy for you.

04:11.233 --> 04:13.802
I just got off the phone with his dad.

04:13.802 --> 04:16.672
Ben, Fitch is dead.

04:22.645 --> 04:24.280
I should probably blow out that candle.

04:26.048 --> 04:27.116
Riley: Thanks again for coming with me,

04:27.116 --> 04:28.517
Mrs. Wheeler. I just...

04:28.517 --> 04:30.686
I don't think I could
face Fitch's family alone.

04:30.686 --> 04:32.221
You know I'm always here for you.

04:33.589 --> 04:35.057
You're still buying me
lunch afterwards, right?

04:37.493 --> 04:40.029
Just I can't believe my
last words to him were

04:40.029 --> 04:44.133
"What? I can't hear you.
God, your phone sucks!"

04:44.133 --> 04:47.136
At least it wasn't "See
you in hell, old man!"

04:47.136 --> 04:49.138
Sorry, grandpa.

04:52.074 --> 04:53.876
Fitch says he hasn't
talked to his dad in years.

04:53.876 --> 04:56.845
So he's probably gonna
ask me a million questions.

04:56.845 --> 04:58.113
I don't know what I'm gonna say.

04:58.113 --> 05:00.549
I barely knew Fitch.

05:00.549 --> 05:02.184
That was one of our problems.

05:02.184 --> 05:03.252
You're gonna be fine.

05:03.252 --> 05:05.120
Just give him the box of Fitch's stuff.

05:05.165 --> 05:07.701
Offer a quick "heaven
just got another angel."

05:07.701 --> 05:09.236
As long as you get in, get out

05:09.236 --> 05:11.038
and get it over with, Riley, you'll...

05:11.038 --> 05:13.674
Hit the jackpot.

05:15.042 --> 05:17.745
Why didn't you tell me Fitch was loaded?

05:17.745 --> 05:19.179
Because he never told me.

05:19.179 --> 05:22.116
He said that money makes humanity ugly.

05:22.116 --> 05:24.184
Yeah, but it sure makes
apartments awfully pretty.

05:24.184 --> 05:26.787
Riley?

05:26.787 --> 05:28.555
Winston Douglas, Fitch's dad.

05:28.555 --> 05:31.125
Heaven just got another angel.

05:32.192 --> 05:34.128
Bonnie: Wait.

05:34.128 --> 05:35.696
Winston Douglas?

05:35.696 --> 05:37.164
Scourge of Wall Street?

05:37.164 --> 05:39.166
Indicted for insider
trading and racketeering?

05:39.166 --> 05:40.768
A gazillionaire a dozen times over?

05:40.768 --> 05:42.302
- That's me.
- Bonnie Wheeler, huge fan.

05:43.737 --> 05:44.738
I'm sorry, Mr. Douglas.

05:44.738 --> 05:45.906
- This is my...
- Friend.

05:45.906 --> 05:47.040
We're girlfriends.

05:48.108 --> 05:49.877
You were probably thinking sisters.

05:54.848 --> 05:57.918
Well, I am eternally in
this young woman's debt.

05:57.918 --> 06:00.988
Thanks to you, my son and I
reconciled just days before he passed.

06:00.988 --> 06:03.257
Me? What did I do?

06:03.257 --> 06:04.691
He called the old man to say

06:04.691 --> 06:06.093
he met the girl he was gonna marry.

06:07.795 --> 06:09.096
He was gonna ask me to marry him?

06:09.096 --> 06:12.132
Well, his phone sucked, but
I think that's what he said.

06:12.132 --> 06:15.869
(Laughs)

06:15.869 --> 06:18.138
We hadn't talked in years.

06:18.138 --> 06:20.040
He hated everything that I stood for.

06:20.040 --> 06:23.043
Thought I valued money
and power more than people.

06:23.043 --> 06:26.580
God, I'm attracted to you.

06:26.580 --> 06:28.849
I'm only sorry my late
wife couldn't have met you.

06:28.849 --> 06:31.618
Late as in she's not here yet

06:31.618 --> 06:33.086
- or...?
- She passed away some time ago.

06:33.086 --> 06:37.124
Oh, that is so sad.

06:37.124 --> 06:39.092
So I was hoping you could tell
me a little bit about my son.

06:39.092 --> 06:40.594
Oh.

06:40.594 --> 06:43.096
Honestly, I don't know
what I could tell you.

06:43.096 --> 06:44.298
Oh, honey, don't be shy.

06:44.298 --> 06:47.000
Tell the rich man what he wants to hear.

06:47.000 --> 06:48.101
Please.

06:48.101 --> 06:49.837
If half of what my son
said about you was true,

06:49.837 --> 06:51.839
you're the most wonderful,
compassionate, caring,

06:51.839 --> 06:53.273
giving young woman in the world.

06:55.083 --> 06:57.978
Well, he always was a pretty
good judge of character.

06:58.158 --> 07:00.327
You sure there's nothing you can tell me?

07:00.327 --> 07:03.964
There might be one or two things.

07:03.964 --> 07:05.332
We were kind of soul mates.

07:11.571 --> 07:13.406
It's weird.

07:13.496 --> 07:17.033
Fitch is the first dead person I ever met.

07:17.033 --> 07:20.503
And that is why I am honoring
him with my tucket list.

07:20.503 --> 07:22.305
Your what?

07:22.305 --> 07:23.406
My tucket list.

07:23.406 --> 07:24.574
You know? All the important things

07:24.574 --> 07:25.675
I want to do before I die.

07:25.675 --> 07:27.344
Look.

07:27.344 --> 07:28.678
Swim with the dolphins.

07:28.678 --> 07:30.213
Run with the bulls.

07:30.213 --> 07:32.515
Date twins named Mandy and Sandy.

07:34.417 --> 07:37.554
Fitch's death is all that
I've been able to think about.

07:37.554 --> 07:40.390
Hey, did you close with Megan yet?

07:40.390 --> 07:44.094
Actually, she was the one who closed...

07:44.094 --> 07:46.529
the door...

07:46.529 --> 07:49.466
in my face.

07:49.466 --> 07:50.634
Dude, what are you talking about?

07:50.634 --> 07:52.002
You guys were perfect together.

07:52.002 --> 07:53.103
Yeah, I thought you really...

07:53.103 --> 07:54.504
and I mean really liked her.

07:54.504 --> 07:56.406
Yeah, I do, but I'm truly
not myself around her.

07:56.406 --> 07:57.908
I don't know what's wrong.

07:57.908 --> 08:00.510
You ever consider that you
might not just like her?

08:00.510 --> 08:02.345
You could actually be in love with her.

08:02.345 --> 08:05.382
(Laughs) What? No, I am not in love.

08:05.382 --> 08:07.284
I've only ever loved
three women in my life.

08:07.284 --> 08:10.387
Emma, mom and Mrs. Rubenstein,
my first grade teacher.

08:12.322 --> 08:14.424
Now that was a woman.

08:16.192 --> 08:17.218
I don't know.

08:17.262 --> 08:20.697
I think I might actually agree
with the big guy on this one.

08:20.697 --> 08:23.500
Do you try to smell her
hair whenever she's around?

08:23.500 --> 08:26.469
Of course. It smells like sunshine.

08:26.469 --> 08:27.604
Know her favorite flower?

08:27.604 --> 08:29.072
- Daisies.
- Eyes?

08:29.072 --> 08:30.240
Blue with little gold flecks.

08:30.240 --> 08:31.341
- Movie?
- "The Notebook."

08:31.341 --> 08:32.409
- Watch it with her?
- Twice.

08:32.409 --> 08:34.110
(All groan)

08:35.412 --> 08:37.047
You've got it bad.

08:37.047 --> 08:38.548
You, little brother, are in love.

08:38.548 --> 08:40.317
No, no. It's not possible.

08:40.317 --> 08:41.952
Has Fitch's death taught you nothing?

08:41.952 --> 08:43.352
Life is short, bro.

08:43.352 --> 08:46.156
Yeah, which is why we make lists.

08:46.156 --> 08:48.291
And falling in love
should be at the very top.

08:48.291 --> 08:51.027
Well, right next to
having your own talk show

08:51.027 --> 08:52.095
called "Hey Tucker."

08:53.330 --> 08:56.032
I'm telling you, if you
just let her walk away,

08:56.032 --> 08:57.400
you're gonna regret it.

08:57.400 --> 08:58.935
You're right.

08:58.935 --> 09:01.037
You're totally right. Can
you finish feeding Emma?

09:01.037 --> 09:02.138
I'll be right back.

09:04.274 --> 09:07.911
What is love...?

09:07.911 --> 09:09.079
Next on "Hey Tucker."

09:11.581 --> 09:13.450
Hi, there.

09:13.450 --> 09:15.051
Ben?

09:15.051 --> 09:17.053
Hi, Megan. We need to talk.

09:17.053 --> 09:18.655
I'm, honestly, a little busy right now.

09:18.655 --> 09:20.557
But I know what the problem is with us.

09:20.557 --> 09:21.591
I'm sorry,

09:21.591 --> 09:23.426
haven't we kind of been through this?

09:23.426 --> 09:25.628
I just think it's best if we both move on.

09:29.232 --> 09:30.600
(Over intercom) This is Ben Wheeler

09:30.600 --> 09:32.102
and I'm in love with Megan Watson.

09:32.102 --> 09:34.637
(Babies cry)

09:34.637 --> 09:36.339
Oh, is it nap time?

09:37.607 --> 09:40.276
(Over intercom) Sorry, babies.

09:46.082 --> 09:47.117
- Ben.
- Look,

09:47.117 --> 09:48.184
I know what you're gonna say.

09:48.184 --> 09:50.553
Too soon... we hardly know each other.

09:50.553 --> 09:51.688
I'm mean...

09:51.688 --> 09:52.689
(Over intercom) we
haven't even had sex yet.

09:54.255 --> 09:57.291
I beg you to step away from that thing.

09:57.101 --> 09:59.938
Megan, life is short.

09:59.938 --> 10:01.072
I'd tell you to just ask Fitch,

10:01.072 --> 10:03.107
but you can't because, well,

10:03.107 --> 10:04.142
his life was short.

10:05.944 --> 10:08.179
All I'm really asking
for is a second chance.

10:10.279 --> 10:11.516
Chance granted.

10:12.917 --> 10:13.985
Okay.

10:20.925 --> 10:24.925
Watch and learn, kid. Watch and learn.

10:25.496 --> 10:26.931
Pound it.

10:29.934 --> 10:34.038
A mere 20... (Mumbles) years old,

10:34.038 --> 10:37.909
Fitch was a selfless, devoted humanitarian.

10:37.909 --> 10:39.844
Or, as I once heard you describe him,

10:39.844 --> 10:41.145
a dull, self-important, know-it-all

10:41.145 --> 10:42.880
who reeks of patchouli.

10:42.880 --> 10:45.083
Danny, leave Riley alone.

10:45.083 --> 10:47.885
Fitch's father... your
soon to be stepfather...

10:49.587 --> 10:50.888
has personally asked her

10:50.888 --> 10:52.523
to deliver the eulogy
at his son's memorial.

10:52.523 --> 10:53.791
Now I think you could try

10:53.791 --> 10:56.160
to be a little more
supportive of me... us... her.

10:57.929 --> 10:59.597
Whoo!

10:59.597 --> 11:02.867
That was the most exhilarating
and scary thing I have ever done.

11:02.867 --> 11:06.004
Aw, look who's finally shaven.

11:06.004 --> 11:07.939
No.

11:07.939 --> 11:09.607
Skydiving,

11:09.607 --> 11:11.542
number 14 on my tucket list.

11:11.542 --> 11:14.012
Wow, I can't believe you actually did it.

11:14.012 --> 11:15.980
Yup, just me, the clouds

11:15.980 --> 11:17.949
and the 300-pound guy strapped to my back

11:17.949 --> 11:19.951
who actually pulled the chord.

11:20.852 --> 11:23.821
I could have died up there.

11:23.821 --> 11:25.923
How could you be so insensitive?

11:25.923 --> 11:29.127
The love my life just passed away.

11:29.127 --> 11:32.563
Well, before you get matching
his and hers cemetery plots,

11:32.563 --> 11:33.765
let me remind you of something.

11:33.765 --> 11:35.933
You didn't love him.

11:35.933 --> 11:37.535
You don't know that.

11:38.903 --> 11:40.505
Hey.

11:40.505 --> 11:42.907
Did you guys know that Megan
spelled backwards is nagem?

11:44.642 --> 11:45.843
If we ever have a kid together,

11:45.843 --> 11:47.512
I think that's what we might name it...

11:47.512 --> 11:48.746
boy or girl.

11:50.459 --> 11:51.860
Yes, I do,

11:51.860 --> 11:53.629
because that's what love looks like.

11:53.629 --> 11:54.896
It makes you look like an idiot.

11:56.865 --> 11:59.835
Honestly, Riley, sometimes I
don't know what I miss more,

11:59.835 --> 12:03.905
you or parasite-free drinking water.

12:03.905 --> 12:05.741
You know you didn't actually

12:05.741 --> 12:07.776
talk to him this much
when he was alive, right?

12:07.776 --> 12:09.544
This is Fitch's laptop.

12:09.544 --> 12:12.114
There's a bunch of unsent
messages on it for me

12:12.114 --> 12:15.150
so his dad wanted me to have it.

12:15.150 --> 12:19.150
Along with this necklace, which I cherish.

12:20.055 --> 12:23.425
And tried to flush last time he was home.

12:23.425 --> 12:26.828
Riley, admit it. You barely knew that guy.

12:26.828 --> 12:27.829
Oh, really?

12:27.829 --> 12:29.765
Than why did the New York Times

12:29.765 --> 12:31.933
call me for a quote for his obituary?

12:31.933 --> 12:33.802
Do you know how hard it is

12:33.802 --> 12:37.039
to sound heartfelt and
pithy in 25 words or less?

12:37.039 --> 12:39.541
Well, you could make something up.

12:39.541 --> 12:41.510
Oh wait, you did.

12:41.510 --> 12:43.679
Danny, what's your problem?

12:43.679 --> 12:45.514
I need you right now.

12:45.514 --> 12:47.749
You may not recognize it, but this...

12:49.584 --> 12:52.054
this is the face of grief.

12:52.054 --> 12:54.790
Fine.

12:54.790 --> 12:56.158
I'm sorry.

12:56.158 --> 12:57.526
I guess I just didn't realize

12:57.526 --> 12:58.760
how much you cared for him.

12:58.760 --> 13:00.595
What can I do to help?

13:00.595 --> 13:02.864
Well, you can start

13:02.864 --> 13:05.467
by finding something fun
to play during my eulogy.

13:07.536 --> 13:09.037
Fitch's dad is sending his car and driver

13:09.037 --> 13:11.640
so I can find something decent to wear.

13:11.640 --> 13:13.809
It probably has to be black, right?

13:15.000 --> 13:21.074

13:24.586 --> 13:26.688
Riley, I miss you so much.

13:26.688 --> 13:28.690
Riley, you truly mean everything to me.

13:28.690 --> 13:31.693
Riley, you really are the
only who understands...

13:31.693 --> 13:33.962
Riley, I'm sorry, but I
think we need to break up.

13:41.622 --> 13:43.624
Thank you so much for coming.

13:45.359 --> 13:47.995
You know, the receiving line
is only for immediate family.

13:47.995 --> 13:50.264
Oh, of course.

13:50.264 --> 13:53.367
You heard the man, sister, move it along.

13:53.367 --> 13:54.401
That's my mother.

13:56.670 --> 13:58.405
And she's lovely.

14:00.941 --> 14:03.944
Sorry, not exactly the
romantic dinner I promised,

14:03.944 --> 14:05.579
but, hey, great party, right?

14:05.579 --> 14:08.682
It's a funeral.

14:08.682 --> 14:10.918
A funeral with an open bar.

14:10.918 --> 14:13.287
Oh, thank you.

14:13.287 --> 14:15.789
One for me and one for my girlfriend here.

14:15.789 --> 14:19.793
Wow. I've never actually
said that word before.

14:20.861 --> 14:23.497
Girlfriend. I think I like it.

14:23.497 --> 14:25.766
In fact, I think I love it.

14:25.766 --> 14:28.335
Ben, I was really hoping

14:28.335 --> 14:30.437
that we were gonna be able
to talk about all of this.

14:30.437 --> 14:33.574
Hey, if you knew something about someone

14:33.574 --> 14:34.808
that might hurt another someone,

14:34.808 --> 14:36.243
but you think that
someone should know anyway

14:36.243 --> 14:37.878
because it's what
someone would have wanted,

14:37.878 --> 14:40.347
what would you do?

14:40.347 --> 14:42.416
I'd ask someone else.

14:44.351 --> 14:45.886
Oh, Mr. Douglas.

14:45.886 --> 14:47.388
Hi, I'm Ben Wheeler.

14:47.388 --> 14:48.589
I just wanted to say that your son

14:48.589 --> 14:50.791
was an inspiration to me.
And if it wasn't for him,

14:50.791 --> 14:52.292
we wouldn't be standing here now.

14:52.292 --> 14:53.360
Well, there's probably no other way

14:53.360 --> 14:55.596
I would have let you into my house.

14:55.596 --> 14:59.600
And may I present my girlfriend here?

14:59.600 --> 15:01.802
Who, thanks to Fitch, I recently discovered

15:01.802 --> 15:03.570
I am in love with.

15:03.570 --> 15:05.339
Okay, I can't do this.

15:05.339 --> 15:07.341
Ben, I don't love you.

15:07.341 --> 15:09.309
In fact, I don't even
know who you are right now.

15:09.309 --> 15:10.411
I'm sorry. I've got to go.

15:15.249 --> 15:17.885
Well, you make a lovely couple.

15:23.724 --> 15:26.393
Megan?

15:31.799 --> 15:33.400
Tucker?!

15:33.400 --> 15:35.302
What?

15:35.302 --> 15:38.305
Man, I always try on
people's coats at parties.

15:38.305 --> 15:41.008
They keep such random
things in their pockets.

15:43.911 --> 15:46.280
(Gasping cough)

15:46.280 --> 15:48.348
Oh my God, that was not breath spray.

15:48.348 --> 15:49.950
(Coughing continues)

15:49.950 --> 15:52.753
Okay, well, if you see Megan,
tell her I need to talk to her.

15:52.753 --> 15:55.956
Uh-huh.

15:55.956 --> 15:58.325
Megan, hey, um. Ben really needs...

15:58.325 --> 15:59.460
Consider the message delivered.

15:59.460 --> 16:00.728
I just need to get my
coat and get out of here.

16:00.728 --> 16:03.530
I think you're making a really big mistake.

16:03.530 --> 16:04.998
So did the guy who sold you that coat.

16:06.633 --> 16:08.435
Tucker, you don't know what's going on.

16:08.435 --> 16:10.537
No, I do know. And I know Ben.

16:10.537 --> 16:12.740
And he has never acted like this before.

16:12.740 --> 16:14.942
And he's dated a lot of girls.

16:14.942 --> 16:16.343
I mean...

16:16.343 --> 16:17.811
a lot.

16:17.811 --> 16:20.881
Thanks, already feeling better.

16:20.881 --> 16:22.983
Listen,

16:22.983 --> 16:26.720
you are the first girl to
completely shut him down,

16:26.720 --> 16:28.956
to knock him off his game.

16:28.956 --> 16:31.024
Let me tell you something about guys.

16:31.024 --> 16:32.960
We're actually really simple.

16:34.762 --> 16:37.264
The more we like a girl,
the stupider we get.

16:38.632 --> 16:41.835
Basically we become bumbling,
immature, slack-jawed idiots...

16:41.835 --> 16:43.937
also known as Ben.

16:45.706 --> 16:48.442
But that's just it. I don't know that Ben.

16:48.442 --> 16:50.410
I want the Ben I first fell for.

16:50.410 --> 16:52.346
You know, the less weird one.

16:52.346 --> 16:54.314
He's right here.

16:54.314 --> 16:56.750
Megan, listen,

16:56.750 --> 16:59.787
I don't know what we
have or what to call it.

16:59.787 --> 17:02.689
All I know is I've honestly
never felt this way before.

17:02.689 --> 17:05.358
And I know I keep screwing this up,

17:05.358 --> 17:06.492
but I'm new at this.

17:06.492 --> 17:08.862
And I just need to

17:09.863 --> 17:11.898
wait.

17:11.898 --> 17:12.933
I know what I need to do.

17:21.008 --> 17:23.810
Now see, that was perfect.

17:24.944 --> 17:27.446
Yes!

17:27.446 --> 17:28.515
Number 43.

17:28.515 --> 17:31.718
Oh my... bring a couple
together at a funeral.

17:34.822 --> 17:36.924
Thanks, guys. Thought
I'd never get that one.

17:36.924 --> 17:37.991
Swag!

17:42.029 --> 17:43.997
So maybe we'll just take it slow this time?

17:43.997 --> 17:47.568
Hopefully not as slow
as we've been taking it.

17:51.238 --> 17:53.540
So... (Laughs)

17:53.540 --> 17:56.577
Madame, I believe you
were looking for your coat.

17:56.577 --> 17:58.245
(Gasps and giggles)

18:02.950 --> 18:04.885
Danny: Riley, stop. You need to see this.

18:04.885 --> 18:06.353
Danny, not now.

18:06.353 --> 18:08.689
I'm about to give a heartfelt eulogy.

18:08.689 --> 18:10.624
Yeah, about that...

18:10.624 --> 18:12.593
I didn't want to go with "I told you so,"

18:12.593 --> 18:15.028
because that would be rude,
but it's kind of implied.

18:17.598 --> 18:18.765
Just let me see it.

18:20.234 --> 18:22.502
I thought a lot about this.

18:22.502 --> 18:24.838
Riley, I'm sorry, but I
think we need to break up.

18:25.973 --> 18:28.342
At the end of the day, I just...

18:28.342 --> 18:29.610
don't know how much we have in common.

18:30.844 --> 18:32.312
We're such different people.

18:35.816 --> 18:37.684
Well, that's not right. That's not fair.

18:37.684 --> 18:39.519
He can't break up with me.

18:39.519 --> 18:40.687
I was gonna break up with him.

18:40.687 --> 18:42.356
I was gonna do it first.

18:44.958 --> 18:45.959
Fitch: You're breaking up with me?

18:47.027 --> 18:48.929
Fitch.

18:48.929 --> 18:50.631
Oh, my God, son, you're alive.

18:51.865 --> 18:52.966
Aw, man.

18:52.966 --> 18:54.902
Now I haven't met any dead people.

18:57.404 --> 18:58.872
I guess when they found
nothing but my laptop

18:58.872 --> 19:00.908
and that necklace, they assumed I was dead.

19:00.958 --> 19:04.958
Turns out you can't trust
a monkey with a note.

19:06.330 --> 19:07.798
You were gone for two weeks.

19:07.798 --> 19:09.032
What were you doing that whole time?

19:11.702 --> 19:13.704
Guess I needed time to think...

19:13.704 --> 19:15.672
about us.

19:15.672 --> 19:18.875
Oh. Oh, and how you were
gonna break up with me

19:18.875 --> 19:20.610
via video message, which is just like

19:20.610 --> 19:23.647
a notch above a text, by the way.

19:23.647 --> 19:27.384
I never sent that message
because it wasn't true.

19:27.384 --> 19:30.020
I was just trying to protect myself.

19:30.020 --> 19:32.522
In my heart of hearts,

19:32.522 --> 19:33.991
I knew you would never say yes.

19:43.600 --> 19:45.936
Is there any chance I was wrong?

19:48.005 --> 19:49.706
I'm really sorry.

19:52.542 --> 19:56.046
But there is a girl out
there that deserves this

19:56.046 --> 19:57.948
because you are,

19:57.948 --> 20:00.450
in every way,

20:00.450 --> 20:03.286
truly one of a kind.

20:03.286 --> 20:06.490
I really wish you were
the right guy for me.

20:08.925 --> 20:10.627
Oh, my God.

20:13.897 --> 20:15.799
Reconsidering?

20:18.702 --> 20:20.670
No.

20:20.670 --> 20:22.939
I'm good.

20:22.939 --> 20:26.376
But that girl is gonna be really lucky.

20:28.879 --> 20:30.814
Whoo! What did we miss?

20:32.883 --> 20:34.918
Oh, hey, Fitch, you met my girlfriend?

20:36.486 --> 20:37.854
Whoo!

20:42.292 --> 20:43.927
(Sighs)

20:47.998 --> 20:50.000
(Exhales)

20:52.035 --> 20:54.704
(Moans)

20:54.439 --> 20:57.342
Oh, I'm gonna be very happy here.

20:59.477 --> 21:01.246
What the hell are you doing in my house?!

21:02.680 --> 21:04.349
Winston.

21:04.349 --> 21:06.751
Oh, this isn't my coat.
