04:17.437 --> 04:19.769
You're not getting a bike, love,
not at the moment.

04:19.898 --> 04:21.514
- But, Mum...
- But nothing.

04:21.649 --> 04:24.437
- Please?
- I said not at the moment.

04:29.074 --> 04:30.440
Maybe next year, OK?

04:34.496 --> 04:37.079
Sweetie, I said maybe next year.

04:37.207 --> 04:39.540
Stuart Macken says our Jeep
looks like something

04:39.667 --> 04:41.374
a "fedophile" would drive.

04:41.503 --> 04:44.587
- And who's Stuart Macken?
- In my class.

04:44.714 --> 04:46.626
- Is he your friend?
- He's an ass-face.

04:46.758 --> 04:47.839
Hey.

04:49.719 --> 04:50.880
Can I say "anus face"?

04:51.012 --> 04:53.174
- No.
- But it's a science word.

04:54.891 --> 04:56.928
Mum, look out!

05:04.275 --> 05:05.436
Are you all right?

05:05.568 --> 05:07.560
- Chris, are you all right?
- Yes.

05:09.823 --> 05:10.823
Don't move.

05:19.207 --> 05:20.743
Are you OK?

05:41.146 --> 05:43.604
I didn't see you,
you came out of nowhere.

05:43.731 --> 05:46.690
He's not my son, he's not my son...

05:46.818 --> 05:49.151
he's not my son, he's not my son,

05:49.279 --> 05:50.986
he's not my son, he's not my son...

06:34.449 --> 06:37.908
"I'm Chuck, the strongest soldier
in the whole land,

06:38.036 --> 06:40.824
and you're nothing
but a little weakling."

06:40.955 --> 06:42.821
"No, please, leave me alone!"

06:42.957 --> 06:45.700
"Silence, weakling!"

06:45.835 --> 06:47.121
You finished?

06:48.671 --> 06:51.539
- Chris?
- It's gone cold.

06:53.259 --> 06:54.716
Put some more cheese on it.

06:54.844 --> 06:56.551
I don't like that dust cheese.

06:56.679 --> 06:59.592
Then don't put more cheese on it.
Just finish it, please.

07:15.698 --> 07:16.814
Three...

07:20.161 --> 07:21.447
Two...

07:23.289 --> 07:24.450
One!

07:33.841 --> 07:36.709
- Mum wins. You know the rules.
- Aw.

08:20.847 --> 08:22.509
Mum!

08:22.640 --> 08:24.506
What is it, sweetie?

08:28.271 --> 08:30.012
Quick!

08:36.404 --> 08:37.736
Chris?

08:39.365 --> 08:41.106
There's another one.

08:43.660 --> 08:46.495
You're getting far too big
to be scared of them.

08:46.623 --> 08:48.114
What if it comes back inside?

08:48.249 --> 08:49.615
She won't.

08:49.751 --> 08:52.084
How do you know it's a girl?

08:52.211 --> 08:54.419
Eight legs and no willy, see?

08:57.008 --> 09:00.251
- Why don't you just kill it?
- What did she ever do to you?

09:00.386 --> 09:02.924
Encrotched on my personal space.

09:03.056 --> 09:05.799
It's "encroached," and I don't think
she did it on purpose.

09:08.311 --> 09:10.223
Dad would kill it for me.

09:13.941 --> 09:15.523
I'm not Dad.

09:16.653 --> 09:18.690
Why did we move here without him?

09:20.156 --> 09:22.569
It's not that simple, sweetie.

09:22.700 --> 09:24.032
Why?

09:24.160 --> 09:26.527
- It's just not, OK?
- Why?

09:26.663 --> 09:29.497
You said he'd be right behind us.
You're a liar.

09:41.094 --> 09:42.460
- Liar!
- Chris!

09:42.595 --> 09:44.837
- Liar!
- Sweetie...

09:57.318 --> 09:59.355
Chris! Wait!

10:04.242 --> 10:05.858
Christopher!

10:13.876 --> 10:15.367
Chris?

10:16.379 --> 10:18.166
Christopher!

10:44.907 --> 10:46.318
Chris?

11:24.405 --> 11:26.237
Mum?

11:30.912 --> 11:33.199
Never run off on me like that again, OK?

11:35.416 --> 11:36.416
I'm sorry.

11:38.669 --> 11:39.669
Me too.

11:42.089 --> 11:44.081
I know that Dad makes you sad.

11:50.014 --> 11:51.471
Love you.

11:51.599 --> 11:52.885
I love you, too.

11:56.062 --> 11:57.143
Mum?

12:00.191 --> 12:01.773
What is that?

12:03.986 --> 12:05.693
Nothing.

12:07.114 --> 12:08.821
Come on, let's go home.

12:29.679 --> 12:32.968
<i>Anne? This is Woody.</i>

12:33.099 --> 12:36.183
<i>Well, I have a ticket for
the Hi-Teen Carnival Saturday,</i>

12:36.310 --> 12:38.893
<i>and... well, would you like to go?</i>

12:39.981 --> 12:41.188
<i>Why, yes, Woody.</i>

12:41.315 --> 12:44.934
<i>I'll have to talk to my folks about it
but I think I can go.</i>

12:45.069 --> 12:47.061
<i>That'll be fun!</i>

12:47.196 --> 12:48.277
<i>Yeah.</i>

12:48.406 --> 12:51.649
<i>Well, shall I pick you up
about eight o'clock?</i>

12:51.784 --> 12:53.241
<i>That's fine, Woody.</i>

14:30.383 --> 14:31.999
Are you gonna show me that?

14:41.978 --> 14:43.514
You should sign up.

14:44.522 --> 14:46.559
Might be a good way
of making new friends.

14:46.691 --> 14:48.182
Don't wanna make new friends.

14:50.736 --> 14:53.695
You know, when I was your age,
I moved town once, too.

14:53.823 --> 14:57.112
I was really scared about going
to this new place where I'd never been.

14:57.243 --> 15:00.611
But when I got there, my mum
signed me up for the Brownies,

15:00.746 --> 15:04.160
and before I knew it,
I had a whole group of new friends.

15:04.291 --> 15:08.035
So, maybe that might happen to you
if you sign up for this.

15:08.170 --> 15:09.456
Maybe.

15:12.425 --> 15:14.007
You'll settle in, sweetie.

15:15.011 --> 15:16.877
We're gonna be happy living here.

15:17.013 --> 15:19.096
I promise.

15:19.223 --> 15:21.431
<i>Well, he had one of those faces...</i>

15:21.559 --> 15:24.518
you just wanted to punch
over and over and over again.

15:24.645 --> 15:26.728
You know, like this?

15:26.856 --> 15:29.519
You've never punched anyone
in your entire life.

15:29.650 --> 15:31.767
I punched Tom Drum.

15:31.902 --> 15:35.020
That poor kid who always had
the moustache of snot under his nose?

15:35.156 --> 15:36.237
That's the one, yeah.

15:36.365 --> 15:39.529
Yeah, I punched him square
in the forehead, remember?

15:39.660 --> 15:40.992
Why?

15:42.413 --> 15:43.904
It was years ago. It doesn't matter.

15:44.040 --> 15:46.123
But the thing is,
he gets out of his car.

15:46.250 --> 15:49.209
And he's walking towards me,
screaming at me that I cut him off,

15:49.336 --> 15:52.374
- and he's raging...
- You want a bloody degree to open this.

15:53.424 --> 15:54.835
That's you fucked, isn't it?

15:54.967 --> 15:57.550
And when are you planning on graduating?

15:57.678 --> 15:59.635
Jay's a permanent student.

15:59.764 --> 16:02.507
- I'm a lecturer.
<i>- Assistant</i> lecturer.

16:02.641 --> 16:05.054
I am shaping impressionable minds.

16:05.186 --> 16:06.768
Sarah studied teaching too.

16:06.896 --> 16:10.105
Well, I only did a year.
I, uh... had to drop out.

16:10.983 --> 16:14.147
I got pregnant with Chris
and kind of took a different path.

16:14.278 --> 16:17.737
I'm glad your path took you down here.
Best employee I ever had.

16:17.865 --> 16:19.731
How is that junk shop
of yours anyway?

16:19.867 --> 16:21.574
Rob, tell your brother he's an asshole.

16:21.702 --> 16:22.818
You're an asshole.

16:22.953 --> 16:25.320
So, what happened
with the guy who hit your car?

16:25.456 --> 16:28.039
Oh, yeah, yeah. So, anyway,
he comes over to the car, right?

16:28.167 --> 16:29.567
And he puts his hand on the bonnet.

16:29.668 --> 16:31.455
And I swear
he's not gonna budge an inch,

16:31.587 --> 16:33.624
and he's glaring right at me,
and you can see...

16:33.756 --> 16:36.590
- Sounds like Walkie-Talkie.
- Who's that?

16:36.717 --> 16:38.299
Walkie-Talkie.

16:38.427 --> 16:41.261
It's this crazy old lady
who lives up in the hills near here.

16:41.388 --> 16:43.721
Near the bridge by your house.
You must have seen her.

16:43.849 --> 16:46.136
Yeah, that's the woman
you told me murdered her kid.

16:46.268 --> 16:47.600
She didn't murder him.

16:47.728 --> 16:49.594
- No?
- No.

16:50.689 --> 16:52.271
Tell the story.

16:52.399 --> 16:53.435
There's no story.

16:53.567 --> 16:55.650
No. Go on.

16:58.280 --> 17:02.570
Her son James was in my class,
used to sit across from me in school.

17:02.701 --> 17:06.069
He was really nice, friendly,
really into nature, I remember.

17:06.204 --> 17:09.868
He used to have, um,
ants in a pencil case under his desk.

17:10.000 --> 17:12.992
Anyway, when we were around eight,
Noreen...

17:13.128 --> 17:14.336
Noreen Brady's her name...

17:14.463 --> 17:16.796
she came bursting into the classroom.

17:16.924 --> 17:20.166
Out of control,
screaming insane things about him.

17:20.301 --> 17:23.545
It took three teachers
to drag her into the principal's office

17:23.681 --> 17:25.798
and lock her in before the police came.

17:25.933 --> 17:27.720
Nobody knew what was wrong with her.

17:27.852 --> 17:30.139
He was taken out of school for a while,
and...

17:30.271 --> 17:32.012
she went away to have her head fixed.

17:32.898 --> 17:35.311
- And then, a few months later...
- She got out...

17:35.442 --> 17:37.149
got a car and mowed the kid down.

17:37.278 --> 17:39.190
No.
No, that's not what happened.

17:39.321 --> 17:42.109
It was an accident.
It was an awful tragedy.

17:42.241 --> 17:43.823
The poor woman.

18:54.688 --> 18:55.929
Chris?

19:15.876 --> 19:17.412
Sweetie?

19:18.462 --> 19:20.499
What are you doing down here?

21:30.219 --> 21:31.380
Christopher?

21:57.704 --> 22:00.367
<i>- Emergency.</i>
- Um, is this the police?

22:00.499 --> 22:03.242
<i>No, but I can connect you to
the police. What's the emergency?</i>

22:03.377 --> 22:05.118
It's my son, he's missing.

22:05.254 --> 22:08.418
<i>- OK, what's your address, please?</i>
- Uh... there's, um...

22:09.425 --> 22:11.382
There's no number on the house.

22:11.510 --> 22:15.470
<i>- Tell me what town you're in.</i>
- No, someone might've taken him.

22:15.597 --> 22:17.839
<i>You're gonna have to stay calm
and tell me where you live</i>

22:17.975 --> 22:20.058
<i>if you want me to help you.</i>

22:20.185 --> 22:22.017
<i>OK?</i>

22:24.982 --> 22:26.268
<i>Hello?</i>

22:27.901 --> 22:30.484
<i>- Hello?</i>
- Mummy?

22:30.612 --> 22:32.353
<i>Hel...</i>

22:33.824 --> 22:34.940
Where were you?

22:36.076 --> 22:38.534
Chris! Where were you?

22:39.580 --> 22:41.913
- Here.
- No, you weren't.

22:44.460 --> 22:45.871
Are you OK, Mummy?

22:53.051 --> 22:56.215
- How long you been in the area?
- Um, just a few weeks.

22:56.346 --> 22:59.510
And has it only been since the move
that you've felt like this?

22:59.641 --> 23:02.554
Any history of anxiety disorders
in your family?

23:02.686 --> 23:05.224
- No.
- Have you ever been on medication?

23:05.355 --> 23:07.893
- No.
- How about that scar?

23:09.693 --> 23:11.184
May I see it, please?

23:20.621 --> 23:22.362
That's quite the bump.

23:22.498 --> 23:25.832
- Yeah, I was in an accident.
- Not so long ago, by the look of it.

23:25.959 --> 23:29.327
About a year ago.
It just sometimes gets irritated.

23:29.463 --> 23:31.750
This is three weeks' worth.

23:31.882 --> 23:34.420
It's not too heavy
but best to take before bed.

23:34.551 --> 23:38.215
Check back in with me then,
and we'll see how you're doing, OK?

23:42.434 --> 23:44.642
<i>Ah, my prairie flower!</i>

23:44.770 --> 23:47.763
<i>Fly with me!</i>

23:47.898 --> 23:50.140
<i>What do you say, toots?</i>

23:50.275 --> 23:52.267
Sweetie, dinner's ready!

23:53.612 --> 23:56.150
<i>You shall have diamonds!</i>

23:57.074 --> 24:00.442
<i>Like those sparkling eyes of yours.</i>

24:00.577 --> 24:03.160
<i>- Ooh!
- Blue white diamonds!</i>

24:10.587 --> 24:11.828
- Chris!
- Mummy?

24:14.383 --> 24:16.875
- I thought you were upstairs.
- You called me.

24:18.637 --> 24:20.253
Must be pretty hungry.

24:20.389 --> 24:21.755
I'm starving.

25:03.765 --> 25:05.381
Good morning, Mummy.

25:06.393 --> 25:09.352
- Where did you get those?
- The garden.

25:10.856 --> 25:13.974
You know you're not supposed
to go outside on your own.

25:16.528 --> 25:18.064
I wanted to surprise you.

25:21.700 --> 25:23.236
Let me see.

25:29.833 --> 25:32.166
They're beautiful. Thank you.

25:40.010 --> 25:42.468
I can hear your heart beat.

25:42.596 --> 25:44.303
How does it sound?

25:45.932 --> 25:47.423
Peaceful.

26:28.183 --> 26:30.220
So, what are your new friends' names?

26:30.352 --> 26:34.221
Michael and Peter and Sam and Stuart.

26:34.356 --> 26:37.565
Stuart? Stuart Macken?

26:37.693 --> 26:39.434
I thought you didn't like him.

26:43.490 --> 26:46.483
- I don't have to be his friend.
- No, no.

26:46.618 --> 26:48.860
Making new friends is good, remember?

27:33.874 --> 27:35.035
It's OK, sweetie.

28:07.282 --> 28:09.148
Stay here, OK?

28:14.539 --> 28:15.950
Excuse me?

28:21.296 --> 28:23.379
Can you move off the road, please?

28:32.474 --> 28:33.760
Mrs. Brady?

28:36.770 --> 28:38.227
Mrs. Brady?

28:42.776 --> 28:44.392
It's not your boy.

28:47.656 --> 28:48.692
Noreen?

28:51.910 --> 28:54.027
I'm sorry. She...

28:54.162 --> 28:55.744
She likes to wander.

28:56.957 --> 28:59.244
I told her to keep to the side,
but, uh...

29:00.627 --> 29:02.118
she's not a great listener.

29:04.130 --> 29:05.291
Des.

29:06.800 --> 29:08.132
Sarah.

29:12.430 --> 29:14.843
And what's the little man's name, eh?

29:17.435 --> 29:19.518
I should get going.

29:19.646 --> 29:21.854
If you ever need anything...

29:21.982 --> 29:23.268
Thanks.

29:35.829 --> 29:37.536
- He's not your son!
- Noreen!

29:37.664 --> 29:40.452
He's not your son!

29:40.584 --> 29:42.041
Not your son.

29:43.795 --> 29:45.081
Noreen!

30:58.119 --> 31:01.408
<i>Looking beyond this morning,
coastal counties and further inland,</i>

31:01.539 --> 31:03.872
<i>it will be on the cool side
for this time of year.</i>

31:04.000 --> 31:07.289
<i>It's definitely a week of contrasts
ahead, with many scattered showers...</i>

31:07.420 --> 31:09.582
I'm just gonna stop for one minute.

31:21.434 --> 31:23.551
Don't move a muscle, OK?

31:40.912 --> 31:42.369
Noreen?

32:10.734 --> 32:13.351
"I then approached the woman.

32:13.486 --> 32:17.105
She was crouched down on the ground
in front of her house.

32:17.240 --> 32:19.152
I thought she was looking for something,

32:19.284 --> 32:21.742
maybe something she had lost.

32:21.870 --> 32:26.205
But when I got closer, I saw that
her head was buried in the ground.

32:27.125 --> 32:29.082
And I tried to dig it out..."

32:50.607 --> 32:54.476
Ms. O'Neill? Are you happy to sign this?

32:57.739 --> 33:00.072
Ms. O'Neill?

33:00.200 --> 33:02.283
- Ms. O'Neill?
- I'm strong...

33:02.410 --> 33:04.197
Do you want to change anything?

33:04.329 --> 33:07.788
Double or nothing. Go on.
See? Look at that. It's too easy.

33:50.041 --> 33:51.907
Morning.

33:52.043 --> 33:55.377
Hey. I thought I told you
to take a few days.

33:55.505 --> 33:58.293
I know, I'm just not good
at sitting around the house.

33:58.424 --> 33:59.960
Oh, I hear ya.

34:00.093 --> 34:02.176
Why do you think I opened this place?

34:05.849 --> 34:08.717
- So, how was your weekend?
- Fine.

34:11.771 --> 34:14.058
Must've been quite a shock.

34:14.190 --> 34:15.931
Finding her like that.

34:20.737 --> 34:23.856
Is it true? The way she was?

34:25.577 --> 34:27.534
Sorry, I don't mean to probe. Sorry.

34:27.661 --> 34:29.995
- It's just it's so bizarre.
- I know.

34:32.458 --> 34:34.165
And how's Chris?

34:36.795 --> 34:38.331
Yeah. He's fine, thanks.

34:43.428 --> 34:46.637
Do you ever look at your kids
and not recognize them?

34:46.764 --> 34:49.757
Yeah, twins are usually hidden
under a layer of shite.

34:49.893 --> 34:52.601
Or food, or both. And as for Saoirse...

34:52.728 --> 34:55.141
Jesus!
It's all about the eyebrows these days.

34:55.273 --> 34:57.981
Not how they look, but how they are.

34:59.110 --> 35:01.727
- Their personalities.
- Of course.

35:01.863 --> 35:05.322
They swing from monsters to angels
and back again in the blink of an eye.

35:08.745 --> 35:10.327
You all right?

35:11.623 --> 35:13.239
Yeah.

35:13.374 --> 35:15.206
Just a funny few days.

36:44.465 --> 36:46.172
Sarah?

36:49.887 --> 36:51.628
Sorry for your loss.

36:53.182 --> 36:55.640
I'm just glad she's at peace now.

36:55.768 --> 36:58.055
They wanted me to put a lid on,

36:58.187 --> 37:00.520
but she'll be in the dark long enough.

37:03.860 --> 37:05.567
Will you join me?

37:05.695 --> 37:08.278
OK.

37:10.074 --> 37:11.485
Thanks.

37:18.833 --> 37:21.701
James. He, uh...

37:21.836 --> 37:24.829
lost that tooth playing hurling.

37:24.964 --> 37:28.002
He thought it a badge of honor.

37:30.845 --> 37:32.052
He's cute.

37:34.140 --> 37:35.506
He was.

37:39.103 --> 37:41.561
I remember the day he was born.

37:41.689 --> 37:47.026
Noreen said she finally understood
what life was all about.

37:48.988 --> 37:50.445
We both did.

37:54.118 --> 37:58.658
You, did you get that same feeling
when your little man was born?

38:00.541 --> 38:03.909
And what's his name?
I didn't catch it the last time we met.

38:04.045 --> 38:05.786
Christopher.

38:05.922 --> 38:07.333
Chris.

38:11.552 --> 38:14.010
She didn't mean him any harm, you know?

38:20.103 --> 38:21.935
Why did she say he wasn't my son?

38:23.648 --> 38:25.560
That's what Noreen did.

38:27.068 --> 38:30.687
Just after his eighth birthday,
Noreen started to say that...

38:30.822 --> 38:34.111
James was... different.

38:35.493 --> 38:40.955
She saw tiny, insignificant things
only a mother would notice.

38:42.500 --> 38:46.244
It was like little pebbles
rolling down a hill, you know?

38:46.379 --> 38:48.871
Then you blink
and it becomes a landslide.

38:50.007 --> 38:54.502
A specialist had some fancy name
for whatever fuse had popped,

38:54.637 --> 38:57.550
but putting a label on it
didn't make her any better.

38:59.642 --> 39:00.758
She was convinced.

39:02.562 --> 39:03.562
Of what?

39:05.606 --> 39:07.393
That he was an impostor.

39:09.444 --> 39:10.810
Wasn't her son.

39:12.113 --> 39:14.605
I suppose when she saw your Chris,

39:14.740 --> 39:17.904
it reminded her of our James.

39:18.035 --> 39:20.618
What happened to him?

39:20.746 --> 39:22.282
He was hit by a car.

39:23.833 --> 39:25.074
My car.

39:27.170 --> 39:29.537
I didn't see him dart out on the road.

39:35.303 --> 39:36.419
Well...

39:37.763 --> 39:39.425
here I am, eh?

39:40.475 --> 39:42.762
Maudlin as that bunch of...

39:42.894 --> 39:45.728
professional mourners
lurking out there.

39:54.238 --> 39:59.108
I always think it's better to...
remember happier times.

40:03.331 --> 40:04.993
Thanks for coming by.

42:39.070 --> 42:42.814
Do you remember those beautiful flowers
you picked for me in the garden?

42:43.991 --> 42:45.152
Yes.

42:45.284 --> 42:47.276
Have you been going anywhere else?

42:48.579 --> 42:50.286
No.

42:50.414 --> 42:52.201
Like the forest, maybe?

42:55.670 --> 42:57.332
No, Mummy.

43:00.675 --> 43:02.712
So, how's Chuck doing?

43:02.843 --> 43:05.756
Haven't seen you play with him lately.

43:05.888 --> 43:07.675
He's still your favorite, right?

43:13.938 --> 43:17.352
Are you sure you haven't been
going into the forest on your own?

43:17.483 --> 43:19.099
No, Mummy.

43:20.695 --> 43:22.607
Then how did he get out there?

43:24.699 --> 43:26.782
- No more lies, Christopher.
- I'm not.

43:26.909 --> 43:31.370
- Tell me the truth.
- I am.

43:31.497 --> 43:33.238
- Tell me the truth!
- I am!

43:33.374 --> 43:36.538
- Stop lying to me!
- I'm not lying!

43:41.590 --> 43:43.502
I'm sorry, Mummy.

46:43.772 --> 46:46.640
Mummy? Is that you?

46:54.450 --> 46:56.407
Mummy?

46:57.369 --> 46:59.782
Chris.

46:59.914 --> 47:01.496
Where are you?

47:03.208 --> 47:04.915
In bed, why?

47:13.177 --> 47:14.964
Good night, Mummy.

47:17.264 --> 47:18.880
Good night, sweetie.

47:29.902 --> 47:32.394
And in.

47:32.529 --> 47:35.317
And out.

47:35.449 --> 47:37.611
And in.

47:37.743 --> 47:39.780
And out.

47:41.622 --> 47:44.956
And a big, deep one.

47:45.084 --> 47:47.918
And out.

47:48.045 --> 47:51.209
<i>It's not the most unusual thing
I've heard of a kid eating.</i>

47:51.340 --> 47:53.923
Yeah, but usually
he's petrified of them.

47:56.929 --> 47:59.797
There's something
not right with him lately.

47:59.932 --> 48:02.595
I can't put my finger on it, but I know.

48:03.852 --> 48:06.094
I just know he's not himself.

48:06.230 --> 48:08.222
And how are you feeling?

48:08.357 --> 48:10.314
Is the medication helping?

48:16.907 --> 48:19.524
May I ask you a personal question?

48:19.660 --> 48:20.992
Yeah.

48:21.120 --> 48:24.033
Chris's father, is he around?

48:27.793 --> 48:30.001
And that scar on your head...

48:31.630 --> 48:34.043
was it actually an accident, Sarah?

49:16.300 --> 49:21.295
..<i>picked him up to have a chat.
Hired me, right there on the spot.</i>

49:21.430 --> 49:25.344
<i>Three tours...</i>

49:25.476 --> 49:28.014
<i>So, which one of you boys can sing?</i>

50:35.796 --> 50:37.913
What are you doing, Mummy?

50:40.467 --> 50:42.083
Washing.

51:32.269 --> 51:33.510
Morning.

51:34.771 --> 51:36.057
I finished it.

51:38.775 --> 51:40.391
Are you hungry?

51:40.527 --> 51:41.859
Come on.

52:04.843 --> 52:07.130
You know I love you very much, sweetie.

52:09.890 --> 52:13.554
I'm sorry if I've been acting a little
strange lately. It's just that...

52:14.645 --> 52:19.185
sometimes when you're a grown-up,
life gets all blocked up with worry.

52:21.902 --> 52:24.394
But then I look at you and...

52:24.529 --> 52:27.021
I remember what life
is really all about.

52:37.960 --> 52:39.496
Chris...

53:33.974 --> 53:36.341
Next up, we have <i>my</i> class.

53:36.476 --> 53:40.811
So, please, put your hands together
for the Rattlin' Boggers!

53:51.825 --> 53:55.785
<i>♪ O-ro the rattlin' bog

55:08.777 --> 55:11.110
the valley-o.

55:54.156 --> 55:55.613
Sarah?

55:57.367 --> 55:58.858
Sarah?

55:58.994 --> 56:00.360
Are you all right?

56:02.622 --> 56:04.033
Sarah?

56:07.794 --> 56:09.035
He's not my son.

56:11.173 --> 56:12.414
Chris?

56:14.217 --> 56:17.005
- Whose son is he?
- I don't know, but it's not Chris.

56:17.137 --> 56:18.969
I don't know what you mean.

56:19.097 --> 56:21.464
I know I sound crazy,
but if it was yours, you would know.

56:21.600 --> 56:24.593
OK. Let's go for a walk.

56:26.146 --> 56:28.980
Sarah... let's get some air.

56:32.277 --> 56:34.018
Did you see me?

56:35.447 --> 56:36.483
Mummy?

56:37.657 --> 56:39.899
- What's wrong?
- Wasn't he brilliant?

56:42.329 --> 56:43.365
Sarah?

56:43.497 --> 56:46.240
You OK, Ms. O'Neill?

56:46.374 --> 56:47.785
Mummy?

56:53.340 --> 56:54.797
Mummy!

57:52.524 --> 57:55.642
I've seen myself grow old
from too many angles.

57:58.071 --> 58:01.940
Even after 30 years,
she still checked me every day.

58:02.075 --> 58:04.067
Checked you for what?

58:04.202 --> 58:05.534
That I was still me.

58:08.415 --> 58:10.532
The mirror always tells the truth.

58:11.585 --> 58:13.326
That's what she'd say.

58:19.718 --> 58:21.300
I need to show you something.

58:22.554 --> 58:25.513
What was wrong with James,
I think it's happening to Chris.

58:25.640 --> 58:29.725
- There was nothing wrong with James.
- Please, just look at it.

58:31.021 --> 58:33.684
<i>What are you doing, Mummy?</i>

58:33.815 --> 58:34.896
Please.

58:35.025 --> 58:37.062
<i>Washing.</i>

58:37.193 --> 58:40.061
<i>Why don't you stay up here
and play with your toys?</i>

58:46.202 --> 58:47.659
Do you see it?

58:49.331 --> 58:51.072
That can't be my son.

58:53.335 --> 58:56.123
Tell me you see him. Tell me.

58:58.965 --> 59:01.423
I'm sorry. I can't see anything.

59:01.551 --> 59:03.213
- Noreen was right.
- Enough.

59:03.345 --> 59:04.927
- He wasn't your son!
- Enough.

59:05.055 --> 59:07.468
Chris isn't Chris,
and James wasn't James!

59:07.599 --> 59:09.431
Enough!

59:20.820 --> 59:22.527
Then tell me I'm wrong.

59:23.490 --> 59:25.573
Tell me I'm crazy. Tell me.

59:29.412 --> 59:30.653
I can't.

01:00:11.746 --> 01:00:13.032
Mummy?

01:00:17.669 --> 01:00:19.911
Why did you run away from me at school?

01:00:22.799 --> 01:00:24.665
I wasn't feeling too good.

01:00:26.594 --> 01:00:27.960
Do you feel better now?

01:00:29.431 --> 01:00:31.889
Yeah. Much.

01:00:34.894 --> 01:00:37.762
You won't run away on me again,
will you?

01:00:39.149 --> 01:00:40.230
No.

01:00:42.360 --> 01:00:44.693
I don't like being left on my own.

01:00:52.036 --> 01:00:53.117
You hungry?

01:00:56.666 --> 01:00:58.282
I'll make your favorite.

01:01:22.066 --> 01:01:23.728
I love you, Mummy.

01:01:24.944 --> 01:01:26.480
I love you, too.

01:01:38.208 --> 01:01:39.995
Dinner's ready!

01:01:51.888 --> 01:01:53.470
Come on, before it gets cold.

01:02:06.861 --> 01:02:09.228
Don't you want some?

01:02:09.364 --> 01:02:12.107
You know I don't like the dust cheese,
remember?

01:02:44.732 --> 01:02:48.100
<i>- Chuck?
- That's damn right, soldier.</i>

01:02:51.698 --> 01:02:54.907
<i>You need to be more careful
with your weapon, trooper...</i>

01:02:58.621 --> 01:03:00.988
You know what
we haven't played in a while?

01:03:02.041 --> 01:03:03.782
Our game.

01:03:05.253 --> 01:03:06.460
Our favorite.

01:03:15.513 --> 01:03:16.845
Three...

01:03:24.689 --> 01:03:26.021
two...

01:03:33.239 --> 01:03:34.239
one.

01:03:43.207 --> 01:03:44.823
You're not my son.

01:03:51.466 --> 01:03:53.207
You're not Chris.

01:03:56.679 --> 01:03:58.261
You're not my son.

01:04:01.351 --> 01:04:03.013
You're not my son.
