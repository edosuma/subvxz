00:00.253 --> 00:03.039
- <i>Previously on</i> Underground...
- I made a plan.

00:03.073 --> 00:05.179
<i>Going back to get Momma and James.</i>

00:05.219 --> 00:07.561
But ain't nothin' ever go as planned.

00:07.689 --> 00:09.425
You can still bite, can't you?

00:09.458 --> 00:12.459
Everywhere you take me,
there's no reflections of us.

00:12.506 --> 00:14.875
<i>It's just rich and white.</i>

00:14.908 --> 00:17.578
- How can we get to the Black Rose?
- You got to go through her momma.

00:17.611 --> 00:19.213
<i>She the only thing that girl care about.</i>

00:19.245 --> 00:20.646
It work!

00:20.680 --> 00:21.914
<i>Ain't gonna be long</i>

00:21.948 --> 00:23.317
<i>'fore he do whatever I want.</i>

00:23.349 --> 00:24.851
<i>Good.</i>

00:24.884 --> 00:27.854
'Cause you gonna use him
to get me off this island.

00:35.529 --> 00:37.331
That one right there.

00:37.364 --> 00:38.724
"Mahk."

00:38.758 --> 00:39.885
"Make."

00:41.020 --> 00:43.169
You said "A"s sound like "ah."

00:43.203 --> 00:45.172
It does until it doesn't.

00:45.205 --> 00:46.907
You see that "E" on the end there?

00:46.940 --> 00:48.574
Changes it.

00:49.125 --> 00:51.452
Why they ain't put it
at the beginning, then?

00:52.145 --> 00:54.047
Daddy, someone's coming.

00:58.475 --> 01:00.978
- They got us trapped!
- Hide the papers.

01:02.011 --> 01:03.180
You run as fast as you can.

01:03.213 --> 01:05.182
Go! Don't look back.

01:07.000 --> 01:13.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:12.248 --> 02:14.217
What do you want from me?

02:14.250 --> 02:15.651
Trust.

02:16.086 --> 02:18.723
That's how you get people
to let their guard down.

02:18.755 --> 02:20.724
And people trust those
that look like them

02:20.758 --> 02:23.094
more than they trust those that do not.

02:23.127 --> 02:26.529
This scar of yours might throw
a few folks off, but...

02:26.563 --> 02:29.800
I'm sure with your charm, you'll
figure out a way around it.

02:29.832 --> 02:31.468
I've noticed that the niggers in my crew

02:31.502 --> 02:33.203
tend to think quick on their feet.

02:33.236 --> 02:34.804
On your crew?

02:35.177 --> 02:37.240
You want me to work for you?

02:37.940 --> 02:39.809
The thing that makes you an asset to me

02:39.843 --> 02:42.213
is also the thing
that makes you a liability.

02:42.246 --> 02:44.008
You don't trust me.

02:45.152 --> 02:46.783
Well, you ain't gonna break me.

02:46.816 --> 02:48.537
Didn't think we would.

02:49.696 --> 02:52.088
But I wanted it to be very clear
on all the ways

02:52.122 --> 02:54.259
in which we could break your girl.

02:57.848 --> 03:00.463
Now that you fully understand
my leverage,

03:00.883 --> 03:03.500
we can properly negotiate
the terms of our partnership.

03:04.129 --> 03:05.770
So...

03:08.872 --> 03:10.808
...how much is she worth to you?

03:15.068 --> 03:20.067

03:30.446 --> 03:32.383
Whoa.

03:33.796 --> 03:35.865
Well, my goodness.

03:35.898 --> 03:38.268
I never thought
I'd see the likes of you again.

03:38.302 --> 03:41.105
Me neither, but it turns out
I need your help one more time.

03:41.137 --> 03:43.673
Last time I helped you,
I ended up with a shot-up shack

03:43.707 --> 03:47.311
and four broken bones,
so my answer is a firm no.

03:47.343 --> 03:48.945
I ain't asking this time around.

03:48.979 --> 03:50.181
Oh, that right?

03:50.213 --> 03:51.681
Things are a little different
since you left.

03:51.714 --> 03:53.350
Really? How's that?

03:53.384 --> 03:55.219
For starters, I keep this close,

03:55.252 --> 03:57.163
in case of such occurrences.

03:58.087 --> 03:59.856
I brought something along, too.

03:59.890 --> 04:01.225
Oh, yeah? What's that?

04:01.258 --> 04:03.794
He got me.

04:30.520 --> 04:33.423
Welcome to the new order of things.

04:33.457 --> 04:34.992
<i>Master Matthew has</i>

04:35.024 --> 04:37.395
<i>taken interest
in this part of the island,</i>

04:37.428 --> 04:38.729
<i>and Master Matthew has mandated</i>

04:38.762 --> 04:41.899
severe punishment for anybody
caught with these.

05:00.217 --> 05:02.919
<i>I see any contraband
in these quarters again,</i>

05:02.952 --> 05:06.589
won't just be the holder of said
contraband who's gonna suffer.

05:08.392 --> 05:09.860
No! No!

05:09.892 --> 05:11.227
No!

05:40.089 --> 05:42.226
Well, it ain't shooting
fish in a barrel.

05:42.258 --> 05:44.727
But this new operation of yours, it is?

05:44.760 --> 05:46.830
Not at all. Simply a way to profit

05:46.863 --> 05:48.731
within the boundaries
of the written law.

05:48.765 --> 05:50.234
How many fugitive slaves come in and out

05:50.267 --> 05:51.435
of your office every month, Magistrate?

05:51.467 --> 05:52.902
More than I care to count.

05:52.935 --> 05:55.138
And, as I understand,
it's upon you to determine

05:55.171 --> 05:57.340
whether the slave matches
the description of its owner.

05:57.373 --> 05:58.775
That's correct.

05:58.808 --> 06:01.244
And if you determine
that they are free men?

06:01.277 --> 06:02.813
I release them.

06:02.846 --> 06:04.282
- Do you collect a fee?
- Five dollars.

06:09.352 --> 06:11.187
And if you determine
that they are slaves?

06:11.221 --> 06:12.723
I collect ten dollars.

06:14.825 --> 06:16.426
You give us three of those dollars,

06:16.460 --> 06:18.294
and we will bring you an endless supply

06:18.327 --> 06:19.897
of runaways.

06:23.567 --> 06:26.837
Seven dollars to sell free men
into the slave trade.

06:26.870 --> 06:28.205
Well, it's nothing so harsh.

06:28.238 --> 06:30.140
Just a case of misidentification.

06:30.173 --> 06:31.175
It happens.

06:31.207 --> 06:32.342
For example, this girl,

06:32.375 --> 06:35.378
real pretty East Indian number...

06:35.411 --> 06:37.515
she has no business being
here in the States.

06:37.548 --> 06:39.183
But it doesn't matter
that her shade of brown

06:39.215 --> 06:40.183
is a little different.

06:40.217 --> 06:41.519
I know a few men, deep down,

06:41.551 --> 06:43.520
who would pay a pretty penny

06:43.553 --> 06:45.388
to put those ruby lips to use.

06:49.092 --> 06:50.628
It's risky.

06:51.054 --> 06:52.830
We capture the wrong Negro,

06:52.863 --> 06:56.033
we place our occupation on the line.

06:56.065 --> 06:59.536
There is no such thing
as the wrong nigger.

06:59.570 --> 07:00.438
Cato.

07:03.839 --> 07:05.409
This one here,

07:05.442 --> 07:07.711
he fancies himself a cosmopolitan sort.

07:08.333 --> 07:11.815
But at the end of the day,
he's just like all the others.

07:12.365 --> 07:16.152
Fact, I bet you ten dollars

07:16.960 --> 07:19.524
he won't hit one out
of five glass pigeons.

07:25.561 --> 07:29.165
Go on, get at it.

08:02.332 --> 08:04.401
Free or not, these niggers are all

08:04.433 --> 08:06.070
still dumb as a post.

08:07.270 --> 08:08.806
Oh.

08:15.311 --> 08:16.713
Momma take Miss Suzanna's chamber pots

08:16.746 --> 08:18.548
out to start of the field
in the morning.

08:18.582 --> 08:20.784
That's closer to the big house
than I want to be.

08:20.817 --> 08:22.119
That's the only time
I know she gonna be alone

08:22.152 --> 08:23.320
to tell her the plan.

08:23.352 --> 08:24.754
What about when she take James out

08:24.787 --> 08:26.422
to the quarters
at the end of the work day?

08:26.455 --> 08:28.092
I don't even know if he's
staying out there anymore.

08:28.125 --> 08:29.994
Not with Sam gone.

08:37.033 --> 08:38.167
I'm sorry.

08:38.200 --> 08:39.902
I just worried about my family.

08:39.934 --> 08:42.006
Don't worry about it. Ain't nothing.

08:44.644 --> 08:47.512
The mistress wouldn't let him
in the big house, would she?

08:48.210 --> 08:49.779
Not unless he working.

08:49.812 --> 08:51.981
When he was younger, Momma used
to sneak him into the attic

08:52.014 --> 08:53.783
to sleep with us in the bed,
then sneak him out

08:53.816 --> 08:56.919
'fore Miss Suzanna woke, but one
of the house girls told on us.

08:56.953 --> 08:58.322
I think it was Corra.

08:58.354 --> 09:01.325
All right, so, if we approach
through the sugar cane,

09:01.358 --> 09:03.460
the wash house'll give us some cover.

09:03.493 --> 09:06.241
Get us eyes on the back porch
without any on us.

09:06.273 --> 09:09.365
And we wait till she come to us,
just like Harriet taught me.

09:09.398 --> 09:10.868
You run 600 miles

09:10.901 --> 09:15.506
to win your freedom,
and now you headed back?

09:17.339 --> 09:19.209
But you ain't even touched on

09:19.242 --> 09:21.178
the hardest part of this plan.

09:21.210 --> 09:23.880
How in the hell you gonna
get your asses back

09:23.913 --> 09:25.282
on Macon land?

09:25.315 --> 09:27.517
Well, that's where you come in.

10:26.776 --> 10:29.159
I know I've been real distant
since we get on that train.

10:29.186 --> 10:30.821
For that I'm sorry.

10:30.854 --> 10:32.961
Rose, you got to stop apologizing.

10:32.995 --> 10:34.002
It's all right.

10:34.035 --> 10:36.554
No, it ain't. I know it.

10:37.428 --> 10:38.538
I just...

10:40.077 --> 10:41.679
I feel like my heart

10:42.011 --> 10:43.549
been broken enough in this past year

10:43.583 --> 10:45.237
for three lifetimes.

10:45.869 --> 10:47.239
And I know I ain't the only one

10:47.272 --> 10:48.323
that the hurt happened to.

10:48.357 --> 10:49.942
It happened to you, too.

10:52.502 --> 10:54.872
After all this, it gonna be different.

10:57.047 --> 10:59.183
I'm gonna be better, I promise.

11:03.594 --> 11:04.757
Here she come.

11:11.209 --> 11:12.636
Ain't my momma.

11:12.669 --> 11:14.032
That's Sara.

11:15.344 --> 11:17.680
- Something wrong.
- Well, maybe your momma

11:17.712 --> 11:19.448
got her doing some work.

11:20.582 --> 11:22.251
What? What did...?

11:22.284 --> 11:23.852
- What did you see?
- She got my momma's keys.

11:23.885 --> 11:25.713
- Rose. Rose. Rose, Rose,
- I got to go.

11:25.738 --> 11:26.488
Where you going?

11:26.522 --> 11:27.586
I need to know
what happened to my momma.

11:27.611 --> 11:28.758
No, no, no, no, we can't just

11:28.791 --> 11:30.211
run up on her so close to
the big house; we don't know how

11:30.243 --> 11:31.624
- she gonna react.
- She go back inside,

11:31.649 --> 11:32.595
I lose my only chance.

11:32.628 --> 11:33.830
Listen to what you just said.

11:33.863 --> 11:35.865
Our only chance, only one we got.

11:35.898 --> 11:37.600
All right, we waste it now,
this whole thing is over

11:37.633 --> 11:39.035
before it even begins.

11:39.067 --> 11:41.069
We got to be strategic,
just like Harriet taught you.

11:41.102 --> 11:43.438
- I ain't leaving without my momma.
- I'm not saying that.

11:43.471 --> 11:45.874
Just, we push back further
into the white.

11:45.908 --> 11:48.510
Nobody be working,
so it's easier for us to move.

11:48.543 --> 11:51.747
Think... this... through.

12:07.769 --> 12:09.472
Noah, if we came too late...

12:09.505 --> 12:10.874
Don't think like that.

12:10.907 --> 12:12.809
We just got to get
the new lay of the land.

12:12.842 --> 12:14.114
How we gonna do that?

12:14.147 --> 12:16.580
I'll sneak into the quarters,
find someone to tell us

12:16.612 --> 12:18.247
what's been going on
around here since we run.

12:18.280 --> 12:19.715
All right, I'll go with you.

12:19.749 --> 12:21.485
Mm-mm, two of us will stick out more.

12:21.518 --> 12:23.653
- I ain't just gonna sit here and wait.
- You got to.

12:23.686 --> 12:24.422
- No, I don't...
- For now.

12:24.455 --> 12:26.709
Rose, look at me.

12:26.742 --> 12:29.058
We got to be patient. All right?

12:29.092 --> 12:31.995
The plan's changed,
but the end result's the same.

12:32.028 --> 12:34.998
We ain't gon' leave this
plantation without your kin.

12:35.030 --> 12:36.572
Trust me.

12:45.107 --> 12:47.510
Ain't nobody so much as glanced this way

12:47.543 --> 12:49.197
since the new overseer come through.

12:49.779 --> 12:50.914
And they won't.

12:50.947 --> 12:53.026
Massa took care of that for me.

12:54.550 --> 12:56.519
It ain't enough.

12:56.553 --> 12:59.088
I want him dead just like my baby.

12:59.121 --> 13:01.457
- No, you don't.
- Yes, I do.

13:01.491 --> 13:03.659
And why you tryin' for save him?

13:03.692 --> 13:05.428
Hmm? He done hurt you, too.

13:05.461 --> 13:08.669
We done hurt each other,
and I'm trying to save you.

13:09.492 --> 13:10.827
Killing?

13:11.333 --> 13:14.103
That's a dark place you
don't want to live in.

13:14.136 --> 13:17.306
Trust me. I know.

13:17.340 --> 13:19.271
And even if you work
through Massa Matthew,

13:19.304 --> 13:21.170
the blood still going be on your hands.

13:21.203 --> 13:23.513
I don't need massa for this.

13:23.545 --> 13:25.748
I gon' do it; you gon' help me.

13:27.417 --> 13:29.824
Make me a poison.

13:30.565 --> 13:32.902
I know you know how the root work.

13:35.225 --> 13:36.860
I can't let you do this.

13:36.893 --> 13:40.169
Let me? You ain't my momma.

13:41.063 --> 13:43.866
Massa done arranged for you
to go work on the mainland

13:43.899 --> 13:46.307
just like I told him.

13:47.337 --> 13:50.781
But I can also tell him otherwise.

13:52.126 --> 13:54.077
You want off this island,

13:54.110 --> 13:56.546
you gon' make me that poison.

13:57.126 --> 13:58.515
We clear?

13:58.548 --> 13:59.448
We clear.

14:15.597 --> 14:18.281
This your grandpa's land...

14:20.569 --> 14:22.471
but it ain't never been home.

14:25.033 --> 14:27.316
You ain't gon' know this life.

14:29.144 --> 14:31.948
Your pappy and me gon'
make sure of that.

14:53.135 --> 14:54.803
- Corra.
- Rosalee.

14:54.837 --> 14:56.139
Why you bring her here?

14:56.172 --> 14:57.455
She gonna help.

14:57.488 --> 14:59.808
She never helped nobody
but herself a day in her life.

14:59.842 --> 15:01.603
And who was you
looking out for when you ran?

15:01.636 --> 15:03.693
She know what happened to your momma.

15:05.962 --> 15:07.264
Is she...?

15:07.289 --> 15:10.784
Mistress sold her off
after massa hung himself.

15:13.255 --> 15:14.491
And James?

15:14.524 --> 15:15.958
He up in the big house now.

15:15.991 --> 15:17.493
With your momma out the way,

15:17.526 --> 15:19.495
mistress done taken him on like her own.

15:19.529 --> 15:21.336
He her favorite now.

15:22.036 --> 15:24.306
- We got to get him out of here.
- Oh, we will.

15:24.331 --> 15:27.167
And the four of us gonna ride
on out and never look back.

15:27.192 --> 15:29.061
Four of us?

15:29.650 --> 15:31.675
She ain't coming with us.

15:31.707 --> 15:34.003
I ain't made for the fields.
They gon' be the death of me.

15:34.036 --> 15:35.135
At least in the big house,

15:35.169 --> 15:37.246
I had clean clothes, a bed, food.

15:37.279 --> 15:40.283
- And you think you gon' last on the run?
- You did.

15:40.316 --> 15:42.485
She know the gossip in the
big house and in the quarters.

15:42.518 --> 15:44.625
We gon' need her to
come up with a new plan.

15:47.095 --> 15:49.265
Guess you gonna have to get used to me.

16:04.029 --> 16:06.365
I haven't seen you around here before.

16:06.397 --> 16:07.726
I never been.

16:08.199 --> 16:11.235
One of my new... cohorts brought me

16:11.269 --> 16:13.371
as an initiation of sorts.

16:13.405 --> 16:14.958
No, thank you.

16:15.740 --> 16:18.876
Normally, I would say
congratulations, but...

16:18.910 --> 16:21.246
your manner and mood doesn't
seem to be that of celebration.

16:21.279 --> 16:23.381
I usually ain't one for joining, but...

16:23.414 --> 16:26.184
this time I really don't have a choice.

16:26.217 --> 16:28.453
That sounds like obligation,

16:28.487 --> 16:30.756
kind usually go along with a woman.

16:30.789 --> 16:31.790
You married?

16:33.891 --> 16:37.261
I was... a long time ago.

16:37.294 --> 16:39.530
- They're trouble.
- Women?

16:39.564 --> 16:42.034
You can only count on yourself.
That's what I say.

16:42.067 --> 16:45.537
I used to think like that.

16:45.569 --> 16:47.640
Yeah? What changed?

16:51.842 --> 16:53.813
I don't know.

16:56.180 --> 17:00.051
Build them walls. Keep them high.

17:00.084 --> 17:02.787
That's the only thing that
can protect you in this world.

17:03.234 --> 17:05.723
That explains a lot.

17:05.756 --> 17:07.325
What do you mean?

17:07.358 --> 17:09.513
Well...

17:10.094 --> 17:12.396
you built your shoe-cobbling
business by yourself.

17:12.429 --> 17:13.798
Got no family.

17:13.832 --> 17:17.468
No, uh, woman, no one to miss you.

17:17.502 --> 17:19.704
No one who's gonna come looking.

17:57.542 --> 17:59.311
You can't do this!

17:59.343 --> 18:00.478
I got my papers!

18:00.512 --> 18:01.647
I'm a free man!

18:03.915 --> 18:05.884
I'm a free man!

18:05.917 --> 18:08.020
Ain't none of us free.

18:10.673 --> 18:13.176
We got to find a way to talk
to James when he out the house.

18:13.209 --> 18:15.746
I've been spending some time
down with Harlan in the stables.

18:15.778 --> 18:17.515
And he told me Miss Suzanna

18:17.547 --> 18:20.002
gon' buy James a new pony for Christmas.

18:20.035 --> 18:23.120
Any time I got a new present,
I played with it right away.

18:23.152 --> 18:24.255
And we catch him tomorrow morning

18:24.287 --> 18:25.355
<i>while he out riding,</i>

18:25.389 --> 18:26.357
<i>tell him where to meet us</i>

18:26.390 --> 18:27.458
<i>after everybody gone to sleep.</i>

18:27.490 --> 18:29.192
He can slip right out the big house.

18:29.226 --> 18:30.795
Can you get us a wagon from your man?

18:30.827 --> 18:32.195
I'll see what I can do.

18:32.228 --> 18:34.364
Still need to know where my momma at.

18:34.398 --> 18:36.434
- I told you, she gone.
- What she's saying is

18:36.467 --> 18:37.767
we got to find out
where they sold her to.

18:37.801 --> 18:39.503
I remember Tom kept

18:39.535 --> 18:41.439
this big, green book.

18:41.471 --> 18:44.275
<i>It-it record every slave
that ever come and goes.</i>

18:44.307 --> 18:45.709
They only care about our names

18:45.743 --> 18:47.445
when they buying, selling or hunting us.

18:47.478 --> 18:48.813
I know that green book.

18:48.845 --> 18:50.592
It ain't in the massa's office no more.

18:50.626 --> 18:51.782
Where is it?

18:51.814 --> 18:52.816
In the overseer's.

18:52.850 --> 18:54.785
It ain't gon' be easy to find.

18:54.817 --> 18:56.853
Bill's a messy drunk.

18:57.313 --> 18:59.343
Bill's still alive?

18:59.722 --> 19:01.524
I'll handle Bill.

19:02.296 --> 19:03.861
Now we know what we got to do.

19:04.337 --> 19:07.698
The book, the boy, then we wait.

19:08.812 --> 19:11.468
And tomorrow night, we all
gon' be gone from here,

19:12.048 --> 19:13.552
for good.

19:35.359 --> 19:37.261
Thank you, massa.

19:43.033 --> 19:44.968
Thank you, massa.

19:51.074 --> 19:54.548
Father, this a surprise.

19:54.582 --> 19:56.914
You don't usually come round here.

19:56.947 --> 19:59.183
You want I get you
some tea cake from the house?

19:59.216 --> 20:00.684
Where that come from?

20:00.717 --> 20:01.752
Where una get that, there?

20:01.785 --> 20:03.353
Oh, massa gave it to me.

20:03.387 --> 20:04.889
Not even for Christmas, just 'cause.

20:04.921 --> 20:07.056
"Just 'cause."

20:07.090 --> 20:08.559
I had to come see for myself,

20:08.592 --> 20:10.628
that what they've been saying been true.

20:11.425 --> 20:13.071
Folks been gossiping 'round here,

20:13.105 --> 20:15.090
that una been laying with the buckra.

20:16.810 --> 20:19.702
Folks say that the baby una
lose belonged to the massa.

20:19.736 --> 20:24.441
After, you ain't never ask me,
not once, if I was okay.

20:25.072 --> 20:27.445
All you ask me was "Who the father?"

20:32.820 --> 20:35.290
You wanted the devil's blood
gone, I did that.

20:35.322 --> 20:37.691
The only thing you should be
coming around here to say to me

20:37.724 --> 20:39.159
is thank you.

20:39.898 --> 20:41.663
No, no...

20:41.695 --> 20:42.830
I'm not going nowhere.
This is my new home.

20:42.864 --> 20:45.080
You're going. Listen to me.

20:51.304 --> 20:53.273
Perhaps I should intervene.

20:53.307 --> 20:54.876
Do you love her?

20:54.908 --> 20:57.277
I... I-I don't know.

20:57.310 --> 21:00.147
Well, if you think you might,
you should know,

21:00.181 --> 21:02.717
she 'bout to do something
she gon' regret.

21:03.524 --> 21:04.986
She may look pretty on the surface,

21:05.019 --> 21:07.622
but she got some scars that run deep.

21:07.655 --> 21:10.095
You can't live the life we do and not.

21:11.559 --> 21:13.022
What happened to her?

21:14.729 --> 21:17.131
Just 'cause bad things happen to us,

21:17.164 --> 21:19.032
don't mean we got to be bad people.

21:19.066 --> 21:21.402
We got to learn to forgive ourselves,

21:21.435 --> 21:25.941
the shame done to us,
'fore we visit it on others.

21:28.775 --> 21:31.345
You care about her,
you need to tell her that.

21:33.214 --> 21:34.749
Why don't you just tell her?

21:34.781 --> 21:38.051
No. She ain't gonna listen to me.

21:39.086 --> 21:40.421
Got to come from you.

21:41.059 --> 21:42.357
Why?

21:44.457 --> 21:47.327
You the only person's
been good to her lately.

21:47.360 --> 21:49.263
Maybe ever.

22:01.549 --> 22:03.176
Oh, I hate the waiting.

22:03.210 --> 22:05.079
It's the worst part.

22:07.247 --> 22:09.683
With Harriet, it was the lion's share.

22:09.716 --> 22:11.785
Working at that hospital,
trying to save up money

22:11.819 --> 22:14.388
so that we could go back on
the run; and even on the road,

22:14.422 --> 22:17.893
it was about hiding,
waiting in safe houses.

22:19.148 --> 22:20.794
And with that waiting,
there comes the worrying.

22:20.828 --> 22:23.064
Thoughts start creeping in about

22:23.097 --> 22:25.718
what could go wrong,
what you should've done better.

22:26.801 --> 22:30.038
It ain't like
I be looking for the danger.

22:30.070 --> 22:31.726
I know.

22:32.439 --> 22:35.275
But in the thick of it,
you know, when it hits,

22:35.309 --> 22:37.414
got to make choices in a flash.

22:38.205 --> 22:41.116
At least there ain't that time
for second-guessing.

22:55.988 --> 22:57.132
Here.

22:59.666 --> 23:00.801
What is it?

23:00.835 --> 23:02.770
Christmas present.

23:02.802 --> 23:04.705
Go on, open it.

23:11.419 --> 23:12.813
I remember you had one

23:12.847 --> 23:15.550
when we was on the run,
for a bit, anyways.

23:16.930 --> 23:19.100
Yeah, I lost it in the brush huts.

23:20.167 --> 23:21.456
Thank you.

23:26.458 --> 23:28.897
Well, you ain't slept
since we got off that train.

23:31.031 --> 23:32.466
Corra gonna be back soon.

23:32.500 --> 23:34.868
I want to hear
what she has to say about James.

23:34.902 --> 23:38.073
I'll keep an eye out for her.
You go on, get some rest.

23:41.509 --> 23:43.411
Thank you.

23:51.823 --> 23:53.621
Tell me about it.

23:53.917 --> 23:55.444
About what?

23:56.735 --> 23:57.892
That house

23:57.925 --> 23:59.894
you're going build for us.

24:18.412 --> 24:19.814
Where Massa Matthew?

24:19.847 --> 24:21.795
Out riding that horse of his.

24:21.827 --> 24:25.218
But he don't mind if
I'm in here, and you my guest.

24:25.691 --> 24:26.625
Ah.

24:31.163 --> 24:32.265
Miss Clara?

24:33.347 --> 24:35.449
Any chance you drank Massa's 24?

24:36.135 --> 24:37.671
You serve it to me?

24:38.465 --> 24:39.699
Then I ain't drank it.

24:39.733 --> 24:43.070
It's just, I can't seem to find it.

24:43.104 --> 24:44.605
How's that my problem?

24:44.637 --> 24:46.273
Something that expensive go missing,

24:46.307 --> 24:48.589
massa gon' have questions,
mean trouble for her.

24:50.023 --> 24:52.012
Then just tell him I drank it.
He ain't gonna care.

24:52.045 --> 24:53.747
Leave us now.

24:56.804 --> 24:58.718
How you feeling?

24:58.752 --> 25:01.923
I'm fine.

25:01.955 --> 25:05.193
I only ask 'cause I know
a lot of people suffering now.

25:05.225 --> 25:07.216
Ones that was on that stuff.

25:07.982 --> 25:10.277
Stuff I done rid the island of.

25:11.298 --> 25:14.234
I'm surviving, thank you.

25:14.268 --> 25:16.904
I guess that no surprise.

25:16.936 --> 25:20.646
I bet you knew I was gonna
go after Hicks all along, huh?

25:21.341 --> 25:23.043
Listen and learn.

25:23.077 --> 25:25.378
That what you taught me.

25:25.412 --> 25:27.781
That how you stay one step ahead.

25:27.814 --> 25:29.583
I learned that lesson good, didn't I?

25:30.882 --> 25:32.252
Seems like it.

25:34.510 --> 25:36.791
You should be proud.

25:36.823 --> 25:38.058
Look at me.

25:38.091 --> 25:40.560
I doing better than even you did.

25:40.593 --> 25:43.296
I ain't serving Matthew,
he practically serving me.

25:44.478 --> 25:47.335
He do treat you more like
the mistress of the house.

25:49.102 --> 25:51.191
Maybe one day I will be.

25:51.638 --> 25:53.306
Maybe.

25:53.339 --> 25:56.444
And maybe this feel like freedom
to you, but it ain't.

25:56.476 --> 25:58.012
Ain't nothing good come from they world,

25:58.044 --> 26:00.937
even if you sitting at the top of it.

26:03.684 --> 26:05.653
Matthew should be back soon.

26:05.685 --> 26:08.489
He always asking me to come
ride with him, but I told him,

26:08.522 --> 26:10.957
I ain't gon' let one of
them beasts kill me.

26:10.991 --> 26:13.161
He swear it gon' save his life,

26:13.194 --> 26:15.156
he ever have to do any fighting.

26:15.190 --> 26:17.098
War coming, he say.

26:17.130 --> 26:19.766
That all he be talking 'bout,
worrying 'bout.

26:19.800 --> 26:22.270
I just tune him out, cause them
white folks start fighting,

26:22.302 --> 26:25.630
ain't nothing ever
gonna touch this island.

26:26.372 --> 26:28.375
But he should be worried.

26:28.408 --> 26:29.976
He got some anger in him,

26:30.010 --> 26:32.379
but he ain't got it in him
to kill a man.

26:33.351 --> 26:35.216
And you do?

26:39.263 --> 26:42.656
Matthew said something
that got me thinking.

26:42.689 --> 26:46.193
That just because bad things
happen to us

26:46.226 --> 26:47.828
don't mean we got to be

26:47.860 --> 26:49.030
bad people.

26:49.062 --> 26:50.665
That sound like good advice.

26:52.566 --> 26:55.303
I know them words come from you.

26:55.815 --> 26:58.740
You warn me off hurting Hicks earlier.

26:59.799 --> 27:03.303
But Matthew also told me he love me.

27:04.110 --> 27:06.980
Those words, they were real.

27:07.013 --> 27:10.217
And I guess I got you
to thank for that, too.

27:30.737 --> 27:33.340
I been thinking a lot
on forgiveness lately.

27:34.413 --> 27:36.177
And I figure,

27:36.210 --> 27:38.679
saying you forgive somebody

27:38.712 --> 27:42.049
is just admitting you ain't got
no power against they wrongs.

27:42.867 --> 27:46.219
That you can't do nothing but give in,

27:46.252 --> 27:51.391
forget, or maybe even kill yourself.

27:53.426 --> 27:59.300
But I got power now,
and I do not forgive.

27:59.708 --> 28:01.875
You knew I wanted it.

28:02.735 --> 28:04.804
And you know what it mean
to be a mother.

28:04.838 --> 28:07.108
You're right.

28:07.140 --> 28:08.908
And I'm sorry,

28:08.942 --> 28:11.242
even though I know
it don't mean nothing.

28:11.869 --> 28:15.548
It's a shame I'm gon' take
to my grave. Know that.

28:16.534 --> 28:19.753
That gonna come a lot sooner
than you think.

28:35.002 --> 28:37.938
It ain't poison you give me, was it?

28:41.675 --> 28:46.280
I made hundreds of cocktails
serving my old massa.

28:46.312 --> 28:50.951
Never thought to add
lemon water and thyme to them.

28:57.523 --> 29:00.194
You owed blood.

29:02.663 --> 29:05.300
But you can't have mine.

29:32.932 --> 29:34.666
- What did they do to you?
- Me?

29:35.281 --> 29:36.917
Look at you.

29:41.552 --> 29:43.521
I overheard some of them talking,

29:43.554 --> 29:45.323
about selling me into slavery.

29:45.355 --> 29:47.491
- No, that's not gonna happen.
- I'm not even American.

29:47.525 --> 29:48.892
They can't do this.

29:49.427 --> 29:51.062
Yes, they can.

29:51.477 --> 29:53.096
But they won't.

29:53.130 --> 29:55.065
- I'm handling it.
- How?

29:57.200 --> 29:59.737
I made a deal with the woman
who runs this gang.

30:00.453 --> 30:02.373
What kind of deal?

30:05.375 --> 30:07.964
Cato, I'm here with you.

30:08.379 --> 30:10.680
You need to tell me
what's really going on.

30:11.116 --> 30:14.117
If I help her kidnap
a number of free black folks

30:14.151 --> 30:16.720
to sell into slavery, she'll let us go.

30:19.890 --> 30:21.758
A number?

30:21.792 --> 30:23.127
30 for me, 30 for you.

30:23.160 --> 30:24.862
You can't do it.

30:24.894 --> 30:26.029
I already started.

30:26.063 --> 30:27.084
With who?

30:27.117 --> 30:28.514
It doesn't matter.

30:28.697 --> 30:30.533
That's a person you're talking about.

30:31.000 --> 30:32.302
You sent someone into bondage...

30:32.336 --> 30:33.938
I don't care about that man.

30:33.970 --> 30:35.539
Before today, he didn't even exist.

30:35.573 --> 30:37.708
The only thing I got to do
is protect you and me.

30:37.740 --> 30:39.376
And if that means
that man's got to suffer,

30:39.410 --> 30:40.537
then that's what that means.

30:40.569 --> 30:41.675
You say that as if
you don't have a choice.

30:41.709 --> 30:43.645
What am I supposed to do?
Let-let them sell you?

30:43.677 --> 30:44.748
Yes.

30:47.163 --> 30:49.487
If it's between me
and subjecting 30 people

30:49.519 --> 30:51.523
into servitude, then yes.

30:53.990 --> 30:56.161
You don't understand what it's like.

31:00.012 --> 31:03.483
I've been trying to figure out
why you... why you left.

31:03.517 --> 31:06.892
Why you came back here when
nothing good could come from it.

31:07.354 --> 31:09.957
I see now that this horrible
country is your excuse.

31:09.990 --> 31:12.193
- Devi...
- You need it to justify

31:12.225 --> 31:13.753
all the bad things you do,

31:14.194 --> 31:16.331
when the truth is...

31:17.196 --> 31:19.566
you're just a bad man.

31:44.625 --> 31:46.093
What time is it?

31:47.066 --> 31:48.291
It's coming up on midnight.

31:48.325 --> 31:49.693
Corra's supposed to be back
right after dinner.

31:49.726 --> 31:51.450
She probably just got held up.

31:51.484 --> 31:53.131
I knew we should've never trusted her.

31:53.164 --> 31:54.464
She sold us down the river.

31:54.498 --> 31:55.718
- We don't know that.
- Don't you see?

31:55.751 --> 31:57.001
Turning us in is her ticket back

31:57.033 --> 31:58.235
- to the big house.
- Nobody come for us yet.

31:58.269 --> 31:59.337
We got to go right now.

31:59.369 --> 32:01.238
Hey, we ain't going nowhere

32:01.271 --> 32:03.207
till you tell me the plan.

32:09.046 --> 32:11.516
I sneak into the big house,
get my brother.

32:11.549 --> 32:12.849
You get that book from Bill's.

32:12.883 --> 32:14.352
Then we meet back at the stables.

32:18.088 --> 32:19.683
Yeah.

32:20.391 --> 32:22.027
Yeah, okay.

34:17.974 --> 34:20.277
Shh. It's me, it's me.

34:20.311 --> 34:22.780
Come on, now, we got to be quick.

34:22.813 --> 34:24.382
- Rosalee?
- We got to leave, okay?

34:24.414 --> 34:26.183
Just get dressed. Hurry up.

34:26.217 --> 34:27.985
- Rosalee, but...
- Come on, now.

34:29.420 --> 34:30.721
Help!

34:30.753 --> 34:32.489
Help! Help!

34:32.523 --> 34:34.725
- Help!
- James, what you doing?

34:34.757 --> 34:36.393
Shh!

34:39.764 --> 34:42.831
This man could have
his own chapter in my book.

34:43.268 --> 34:46.447
The runaway slave
who came to capture 60.

34:47.304 --> 34:49.463
60 ain't the number anymore.

34:51.077 --> 34:52.277
That's right.

34:52.310 --> 34:54.112
My mistake.

34:54.146 --> 34:56.081
It's 59.

34:58.149 --> 34:59.552
It's 28.

35:10.729 --> 35:12.397
<i>She ain't no good.</i>

35:12.430 --> 35:13.765
She sneaky.

35:17.637 --> 35:18.604
And a liar.

35:21.640 --> 35:23.809
And she planning to run.

35:29.515 --> 35:31.317
If you love me,

35:31.350 --> 35:34.387
you'll punish her
for what she done to me.

36:07.940 --> 36:10.076
She gone.

36:56.669 --> 36:57.904
Pardon me.

37:12.084 --> 37:14.986
What the hell's going on?

37:25.030 --> 37:29.702
I been imagining this moment
in my head for so long.

37:29.734 --> 37:31.738
Hell,

37:31.771 --> 37:33.238
I don't even know if I'm dreaming.

37:38.109 --> 37:40.312
But I remember our last night together.

37:43.281 --> 37:47.486
Every time I wake, I can barely speak.

37:50.555 --> 37:52.091
I sit up...

37:52.792 --> 37:55.228
and I think about what went down.

37:56.662 --> 37:58.598
What could have been.

38:01.701 --> 38:04.169
And it always ends in a wish.

38:05.504 --> 38:06.940
A prayer.

38:08.841 --> 38:11.890
Against all odds,
that you and I would...

38:11.922 --> 38:13.746
see each other again.

38:15.280 --> 38:17.416
But I tell you what.

38:20.084 --> 38:23.289
I never believed in God
more than I do right now.

38:23.321 --> 38:24.791
Wait, don't please!

38:24.823 --> 38:27.193
I'm carrying a child!

38:41.640 --> 38:43.442
That don't change nothing.
