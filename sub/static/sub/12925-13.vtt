00:03.567 --> 00:08.567
Ladies and gentlemen,
The Preacher!

00:08.667 --> 00:10.500
Would you extend your interim
preaching period...

00:10.600 --> 00:13.667
so that I can pursue my dreams
of becoming a wrestling star?

00:13.767 --> 00:15.700
Follow your dreams, hoss!

00:15.800 --> 00:17.467
Somebody blew up your mailbox.

00:17.567 --> 00:19.033
Yeah, it's got a catfish logo
on it.

00:19.133 --> 00:21.333
Looks like these criminals
left their calling card.

00:21.433 --> 00:24.467
We are such awesome parents!

00:24.567 --> 00:25.833
Woo-hoo!

00:25.933 --> 00:29.367
Maybe we could just stick
around, have one more drink.

00:29.467 --> 00:31.100
You've been treating me like
a second-class citizen all day.

00:31.200 --> 00:32.833
And the only reason why
I put up with it...

00:32.933 --> 00:34.767
is so you don't get embarrassed
in front of these people...

00:34.867 --> 00:36.533
who clearly don't give a crap
about you in the first place.

00:36.633 --> 00:38.900
You just don't understand how
the music business works.

00:39.000 --> 00:40.600
Is he with you?
Nope.

00:40.700 --> 00:42.767
Sir, you can't get in here
without a ticket.

00:47.867 --> 00:49.700
Dallas, wait!

00:49.800 --> 00:52.233
I thought he'd finally gotten
his act together.

00:52.333 --> 00:54.667
I just wish I hadn't wasted my
time on this stupid article.

00:54.767 --> 00:56.200
Why don't you give it to him?

00:56.300 --> 00:57.633
No, Mom, no, I can't do that.

00:57.733 --> 00:59.967
I might have fallen for your
white-trash...

01:00.067 --> 01:01.267
Prince Charming act once--

01:01.367 --> 01:02.633
Twice.

01:02.733 --> 01:04.433
But I think you should know
what an ass[BLEEP] you are!

01:04.533 --> 01:08.500
She wrote it... about what
a crap-ass dad I am.

01:12.233 --> 01:15.167
[DEBBIE] You know, you are
nothing but a selfish prick...

01:15.267 --> 01:16.933
who only cares about his ego.

01:17.033 --> 01:19.767
[DEBBIE] I want you out
of our lives forever.

01:50.767 --> 01:53.333
There was a bit of a shake-up
on stage...

01:53.433 --> 01:55.933
at a recent Trayne Crostown
concert.

01:56.033 --> 01:58.633
The culprit?
Burnin' Vernon Brown.

01:58.733 --> 02:01.267
Am I the only one who thought
this guy was dead?

02:01.367 --> 02:03.167
And apparently the deadbeat
didn't know...

02:03.267 --> 02:05.033
he had a 15-year-old daughter.

02:05.133 --> 02:07.433
I don't blame her for selling
him out at all.

02:07.533 --> 02:11.433
So apparently his daughter sold
him out in one of her 'zines?

02:11.533 --> 02:13.300
Anyway, this guy not only
went to jail...

02:13.400 --> 02:15.100
for crashing into a church...

02:15.200 --> 02:17.400
but convinced that very same
church...

02:17.500 --> 02:19.200
that he should be their
preacher! What?

02:19.300 --> 02:20.733
Wonder how that interview
went...

02:20.833 --> 02:22.733
"Do you have any prior
experience, sir?"

02:22.833 --> 02:25.133
"Ah, yeah, I took a crash
course about a year ago."

02:29.067 --> 02:32.200
( THEME MUSIC PLAYING )

02:40.300 --> 02:44.800
Well, now, I didn't expect
to see you here.

02:44.900 --> 02:47.567
Sorry, I treated you
like crap, man.

02:47.667 --> 02:51.100
I guess I just got caught
up in the spotlight.

02:51.200 --> 02:54.133
Either way, man,
I'm sorry, buddy.

02:55.133 --> 02:56.633
We're cool, man.

02:56.733 --> 02:59.633
But you didn't have to act
like such a jackass?

02:59.733 --> 03:03.833
Well, that'd be like askin'
a bird not to fly.

03:03.933 --> 03:05.467
So you need a ride or what?

03:05.567 --> 03:07.700
I don't think you got enough
gas in that thing...

03:07.800 --> 03:09.033
to take me where I'm headed.

03:09.133 --> 03:12.467
Thought you might say that.

03:12.567 --> 03:14.967
So I guess I'll see ya around.
Hey...

03:15.067 --> 03:16.767
Thanks for bailing me
out of jail.

03:18.767 --> 03:20.800
It's tit for tat, my friend.

03:23.933 --> 03:25.700
It's tit for tat.

03:44.300 --> 03:47.767
Ronnie? Ronnie, have you seen
my aqua high heels?

03:47.867 --> 03:49.233
What is that, like water shoes?

03:49.333 --> 03:50.567
Aqua, it's a color.

03:50.667 --> 03:53.433
Oh, that makes sense...
so where you goin'?

03:53.533 --> 03:55.667
To shoot the Pool and Spa Depot
commercial.

03:55.767 --> 03:59.533
Because I'm the new girl.
I've told you like ten times.

04:10.100 --> 04:11.833
Hey, is Charlotte home?

04:11.933 --> 04:13.100

Yeah.

04:13.200 --> 04:15.167
She's in her room.
Thanks.

Hi... can I come in?

04:28.367 --> 04:29.567
Yeah.

04:29.667 --> 04:34.267
So, I just wanted to--
about the other night--

04:34.367 --> 04:36.367
My dad's an ass[BLEEP].

04:36.467 --> 04:40.467
He wrecked your show
and you got upset, I get it.

04:40.567 --> 04:42.667
Apology accepted.

04:45.633 --> 04:48.200
Don't worry, she's not
gonna come in.

We're getting so much exposure
from your article.

04:58.133 --> 04:59.800
It's all over the internet.

04:59.900 --> 05:00.867

05:00.967 --> 05:03.900
Your article, about your dad?

05:04.000 --> 05:05.567
What?

Yeah, just search our band
and your Dad's name.

at the concert with my dad.

05:15.333 --> 05:16.767
How did you find out about this?

out in a good way for once.

06:08.733 --> 06:12.633
For good. Sorry for screwing
up your church.

You were always so good to me,
and I won't forget that.

is the blindest of all...

have Laura Beth read it to you.

please read this to Curtis...

and give him these
sunglasses for me.

of freaked me out.

06:42.000 --> 06:46.033

Don't make any plans.

suspicious activity next door?

mowin' her lawn in a Snuggie
once, kinda weird.

large shipments...

ain't no snitch, pal.

Can't say, last question...
whose boat is this?

07:19.267 --> 07:23.267
It is equally on yours
and his properties.

07:27.600 --> 07:30.967
Sir, the boat... is it yours?
I'm assuming it's yours?

07:31.067 --> 07:32.933
Yep, yep, she's a beaut!

07:33.033 --> 07:34.467

application.

out and roll on.

Why would you do that?

08:25.400 --> 08:28.867
Giving him that article
was a stupid thing to do!

for well over 40 years...

my streak now.

just really upset.

08:38.933 --> 08:40.600

to get you busted.

I had the whole thing made up.

the good...

am I to you in jail?

have been better off...

sweeteners.

bad luck by many...

So he's just gonna run
from the cops forever?

12:54.167 --> 12:55.633
Sounds exhausting.

12:55.733 --> 12:59.200
I just hope I get
to see him again.

Dad?

13:02.367 --> 13:04.433
What are you doing?

13:08.533 --> 13:10.567
I don't want to miss out
on any more of your life.

13:10.667 --> 13:12.700
Well, what about jail?

13:12.800 --> 13:17.533

one at a time.

I'm gonna stand right here
until I get some answers.

13:35.133 --> 13:37.933
And I'm not leaving 'til
I get my donations money back.

13:38.033 --> 13:41.867

Y'all, listen, we can't help if
you won't listen to reason, now.

14:06.733 --> 14:08.467
By now, I'm sure a lot of you...

14:08.567 --> 14:10.233
may have read my daughter's
words.

14:10.333 --> 14:13.933
What she didn't write and what
she probably doesn't know...

14:14.033 --> 14:16.800
is that I was afraid.

14:16.900 --> 14:19.567
I've done so many selfish
things, I mean...

14:19.667 --> 14:21.767
there ain't no way I could
ever pay them all back.

14:21.867 --> 14:25.400
I've been untruthful to each
and every one of you.

14:25.500 --> 14:28.767
'Cause the truth is, I ain't
nothing but a liar.

14:28.867 --> 14:30.600
So I figure now,
least I can do...

14:30.700 --> 14:32.367
is stand here and accept
my judgment.

here spouting out all that...

any sense.

We didn't know what
to do with you.

I thought was a preacher!

Well, I just wanted to come
in here and say thank you...

15:13.567 --> 15:17.300
to this man. I mean, he told me
I should follow my dreams.

15:17.400 --> 15:21.067
Not my dad's or my granddad's,
but my own!

15:21.167 --> 15:22.700
And by God, I did.

15:22.800 --> 15:25.633
Now I'm kicking ass
and taking names for Jesus!

15:29.267 --> 15:31.033
Amen.
Amen.

15:31.133 --> 15:34.133
That man up there taught me how
to express myself...

15:34.233 --> 15:37.367
and not worry about what a cake
looks like on the outside...

15:37.467 --> 15:39.633
even if it is a little curvy...

15:39.733 --> 15:42.667
that don't mean it ain't as
sweet as can be deep down.

15:42.767 --> 15:46.167
He scared my friends
and I out of doing drugs...

15:46.267 --> 15:47.833
and I'm never getting married.

15:47.933 --> 15:49.533
He showed us that our marriage
was a sham...

15:49.633 --> 15:51.367
and that we were just going
through the motions.

15:51.467 --> 15:53.600

good friends.

in a while...

but I also know that the reason
we come to this wooden box...

16:15.700 --> 16:19.933
every Sunday is to remind each
other to judge not...

16:20.033 --> 16:22.400

is going to jail, buddy.
