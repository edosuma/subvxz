02:08.657 --> 02:10.392
Hey, Ma.

02:10.394 --> 02:12.394
Where you sneaking off to?

02:12.396 --> 02:14.463
I'm not sneaking off anywhere.

02:14.465 --> 02:17.466
I was just trying to be
considerate and not wake you up.

02:17.468 --> 02:18.634
Oh, that's nice.

02:18.636 --> 02:20.068
Thank you for being
considerate

02:20.070 --> 02:21.770
while sneaking off.

02:21.772 --> 02:22.771
Where you going?

02:22.773 --> 02:24.673
I'm just...

02:26.677 --> 02:28.443
Um, I'll get that.

02:33.349 --> 02:34.316
Oh, good morning.

02:34.318 --> 02:35.617
Morning, ma'am.
I got it, Mom.

02:35.619 --> 02:37.586
Hey, buddy.
Hey. What is all this?

02:37.588 --> 02:38.854
Don't worry about it.

02:38.856 --> 02:41.056
What'd I just say?
Don't worry about it.

02:41.058 --> 02:42.324
Sign the thing
for the guy.

02:42.326 --> 02:45.060
No, not until you tell
me what's in the boxes.

02:45.062 --> 02:46.428
Okay, I'll sign it.

02:46.430 --> 02:48.263
All right?

02:52.101 --> 02:53.235
Thanks, buddy.

02:53.237 --> 02:55.370
Good luck.
All right.

02:55.372 --> 02:58.340
So, you're really not gonna
tell me what's in the boxes?

02:58.342 --> 03:00.409
You're not gonna tell me
where you're going?

03:00.411 --> 03:01.677
I have an appointment.

03:01.679 --> 03:03.245
It's really none
of your business.

03:03.247 --> 03:05.414
Okay. Well, have fun
at your, uh,

03:05.416 --> 03:06.648
none-of-my-business appointment.

03:06.650 --> 03:07.649
Okay.

03:07.651 --> 03:10.752
Have fun
with your mystery boxes.

04:00.303 --> 04:02.004
What's all this?

04:02.006 --> 04:03.772
A farewell breakfast.

04:05.074 --> 04:08.343
OJ or papaya this morning?

04:09.846 --> 04:13.815
Jerry, I appreciate
this farewell breakfast

04:13.817 --> 04:15.817
and the farewell
dinner last night,

04:15.819 --> 04:17.052
and I think
we both agreed

04:17.053 --> 04:19.120
it's time for you
to move on, right?

04:19.889 --> 04:22.324
Was it the snoring?
No.

04:22.326 --> 04:24.659
Because, you know, I can get one
of those breathing mask things.

04:24.661 --> 04:26.261
Listen to me. It wasn't
the snoring, okay?

04:26.263 --> 04:27.729
It wasn't... it's
not you at all.

04:27.731 --> 04:28.830
You didn't... It's me.

04:28.832 --> 04:30.966
You're a great roomie.
I'm just...

04:30.968 --> 04:32.601
I like to live alone, okay?

04:32.603 --> 04:34.302
You can understand
that, right?

04:35.171 --> 04:37.339
You sure it's safe
for me to go home?

04:37.341 --> 04:39.841
Yeah! Yes!

04:39.843 --> 04:42.844
The-the Chinese
government are...

04:42.846 --> 04:44.946
they got... they got bigger
fish to fry right now.

04:44.948 --> 04:47.015
We can still be friends?
What are you talking about?

04:47.017 --> 04:48.683
We are friends.
That's not gonna change.

04:50.086 --> 04:51.186
Good-bye hug?

04:51.188 --> 04:53.021
Come on.

04:55.925 --> 04:57.225
That's it, buddy.

05:00.898 --> 05:01.963
Jerry.

05:01.965 --> 05:02.931
You want me to get that?

05:04.101 --> 05:06.034
Might be better
if I get it, Jerry.

05:09.038 --> 05:10.772
McGarrett.

05:13.076 --> 05:14.910
Okay, I'm on my way.

05:14.912 --> 05:17.112
I gotta go, all right?

05:17.114 --> 05:18.747
You okay with this?

05:19.749 --> 05:21.683
Okay.

05:28.424 --> 05:30.025
Divorce attorney?
Mm-hmm.

05:30.027 --> 05:31.760
You sure?
I'm positive.

05:31.762 --> 05:34.029
She told you that?

05:35.364 --> 05:37.365
No, it's not what she told me.

05:37.367 --> 05:39.468
You followed her?

05:39.470 --> 05:41.870
I might have followed her.

05:41.872 --> 05:43.138
You followed her.
I did.

05:43.140 --> 05:45.073
But she was being very
suspicious this morning, okay?

05:45.075 --> 05:46.341
She's sneaking
all around the house.

05:46.343 --> 05:48.009
And you're not allowed
to judge me, okay,

05:48.011 --> 05:51.179
because I know for a fact that
you surveilled your own mother,

05:51.181 --> 05:53.515
and that makes us even, so...

06:00.289 --> 06:02.390
You know what?

06:02.392 --> 06:05.193
Maybe seeing a divorce attorney
isn't the worst thing.

06:05.195 --> 06:07.529
I mean, then your mother can
weigh her options, right?

06:07.531 --> 06:09.164
No-no-no. Attorneys
are never a good thing, okay?

06:09.166 --> 06:11.800
They get a hold of you, and
forget about it. It's no good.

06:11.802 --> 06:13.603
All right, well,
you'll want to hope that this

06:13.604 --> 06:15.504
top secret op you got planned
for tonight works.

06:15.506 --> 06:17.639
It will. I hope.
Uh-huh.

06:17.641 --> 06:20.175
How are you gonna get
her out of the house?

06:20.177 --> 06:22.144
Day of beauty
at the SpaMakani.

06:22.146 --> 06:25.280
Shiatsu massage,
mani-pedi by the pool.

06:25.282 --> 06:26.948
The whole thing,
it was not cheap.

06:26.950 --> 06:29.417
But if it works,
it'll be worth it, you know?

06:32.121 --> 06:34.356
Hey, Chin, what do you got?

06:34.358 --> 06:36.057
Mailman noticed that
the door was forced.

06:36.059 --> 06:38.193
Thought it looked
suspicious and dialed 911.

06:38.195 --> 06:40.862
Operating theory is that we're
looking at a burglary gone bad.

06:40.864 --> 06:42.430
How bad?

06:42.432 --> 06:44.065
Take a look.

06:44.067 --> 06:46.835
The victim is the homeowner,

06:46.837 --> 06:48.436
Russell Donovan.

06:48.438 --> 06:49.638
And based on
preliminary examination,

06:49.640 --> 06:50.805
Mr. Donovan's C.O.D.

06:50.807 --> 06:52.974
is a close-contact gunshot wound

06:52.976 --> 06:54.276
to the ventral thorax.

06:54.278 --> 06:55.477
That, along with the

06:55.479 --> 06:57.012
rather notable hematomas

06:57.014 --> 06:58.780
and ecchymoses
along the victim's arms,

06:58.782 --> 07:00.749
suggest that the victim made

07:00.751 --> 07:02.284
quite a struggle
prior to being shot.

07:02.286 --> 07:03.985
Liver temperature puts
the time of death

07:03.987 --> 07:05.320
at approximately
3:00 a.m.

07:05.322 --> 07:07.422
Looks like whoever
busted in here brought

07:07.424 --> 07:08.790
their own key.
Very subtle.

07:08.792 --> 07:10.458
So, this guy
gets woken up

07:10.460 --> 07:12.060
to the sounds
of a burglary,

07:12.062 --> 07:14.496
come outs, this guy
surprises him with a gun,

07:14.498 --> 07:16.031
and here we go.

07:16.033 --> 07:17.999
What else do we know
about Mr. Donovan?

07:18.001 --> 07:19.301
He's a 45-year-old
schoolteacher.

07:19.303 --> 07:20.635
Single father. Lives here

07:20.637 --> 07:22.504
with his 16 year-old
daughter, Kelly.

07:22.506 --> 07:23.905
Where is she?

07:23.907 --> 07:25.540
At this point, we're not sure.
Bed's still made.

07:25.542 --> 07:26.942
We're still trying
to determine whether

07:26.944 --> 07:29.144
she's staying with some
other family or maybe a friend.

07:29.146 --> 07:30.412
Hey, I don't
think she is.

07:30.414 --> 07:32.047
A neighbor a few houses down
saw a car

07:32.049 --> 07:33.615
racing down the block
around 3:00 a.m.

07:33.617 --> 07:34.950
with Kelly
in the passenger seat.

07:34.952 --> 07:37.419
They brought it up to an
officer during the canvass.

07:37.421 --> 07:39.120
We get a description of the car
or the driver?

07:39.122 --> 07:41.890
Nothing solid on the driver--
male, 20s-- but we have a plate.

07:41.892 --> 07:44.759
Vanity tags, H2OSPRT.

07:44.761 --> 07:45.794
Commander.
Yeah?

07:45.796 --> 07:47.195
You may want to look at that.

07:47.197 --> 07:48.463
It's the daughter's
cell phone.

07:48.465 --> 07:49.598
CSU found it

07:49.600 --> 07:51.399
on the floor
of one of the bedrooms.

07:51.401 --> 07:52.667
Looks like
she was trying

07:52.669 --> 07:54.369
to call for help.

07:54.371 --> 07:55.670
Killer took her.

07:55.672 --> 07:57.606
Duke, get a MAILE AMBER Alert
out right now.

07:57.608 --> 07:58.840
I want that girl found

07:58.842 --> 08:00.642
before this turns
into a double homicide.

08:44.211 --> 08:45.745
How's it going?
Aloha.

08:45.747 --> 08:47.647
We're looking for Jay Cooper.

08:47.649 --> 08:49.950
That's Jay over there.

08:49.952 --> 08:51.685
How do we
get him down?

08:51.687 --> 08:54.487
Let me call him in for you.

08:54.489 --> 08:56.389
Jay, bring it in.

08:56.391 --> 08:58.558
Five-O wants to talk to you.

09:12.173 --> 09:13.707
Can I help you gentlemen?

09:13.709 --> 09:16.509
Ditch the hardware.
We're gonna be here a while.

09:19.180 --> 09:20.747
I want you
to take another look.

09:20.749 --> 09:22.015
I think you might
be mistaken.

09:22.017 --> 09:23.717
I don't need to
take another look.

09:23.719 --> 09:24.918
I don't know them.

09:24.920 --> 09:26.853
I've never seen this girl
before in my life.

09:26.855 --> 09:28.755
Okay, fine.
Then why don't you explain to me

09:28.757 --> 09:30.423
how she was in your car
this morning

09:30.425 --> 09:32.158
leaving the scene
of a murder/kidnapping?

09:32.160 --> 09:34.027
What?

09:34.029 --> 09:37.030
Wait. Hold on. What car?

09:37.032 --> 09:38.231
2008 blue Chevy Impala.

09:38.233 --> 09:41.501
"H2O Sports" vanity plate
registered to you.

09:41.503 --> 09:42.869
I wasn't driving that car
last night.

09:42.871 --> 09:44.170
Oh, somebody drove that car.

09:44.172 --> 09:45.739
Well, it wasn't me.

09:45.741 --> 09:47.240
It died on me
about a week ago.

09:47.242 --> 09:50.310
It was towed to 'Aikapu's
Auto Repair over on 17th.

09:50.312 --> 09:52.178
As far as I know,
it's still there.

09:52.180 --> 09:53.747
I don't understand.

09:53.749 --> 09:55.749
That car was for sure here

09:55.751 --> 09:58.418
when I closed up
and was <i>pau hana</i> last night.

09:58.420 --> 09:59.719
Anything else missing?

10:00.855 --> 10:03.857
Uh, just one of my mechanics.

10:03.859 --> 10:05.125
Kid named Tommy Fa'alo

10:05.127 --> 10:06.726
He never show up
for work.

10:06.728 --> 10:08.361
I been calling his ass
all morning

10:08.363 --> 10:09.362
trying to get a hold of him.

10:09.364 --> 10:11.531
Is he the type
that might borrow a car?

10:11.533 --> 10:12.799
Tommy? Nah.

10:12.801 --> 10:15.035
He had <i>pilikia</i>
with the law a while back,

10:15.037 --> 10:16.569
but he's a good kid.

10:16.571 --> 10:18.071
Been nothing but honest
and reliable

10:18.073 --> 10:19.539
since the day I hired him.

10:19.541 --> 10:21.441
Do you recognize these people?

10:21.443 --> 10:23.777
Yeah, that's Russ Donovan
and his daughter Kelly.

10:23.779 --> 10:26.346
Been a customer of mine
for a couple years.

10:26.348 --> 10:27.747
Schoolteacher, I think.

10:27.749 --> 10:30.350
I never even know he had
a daughter until she brought

10:30.352 --> 10:33.353
her car in here a few months ago
with a transmission problem.

10:33.355 --> 10:34.687
Did something happen to them?

10:34.689 --> 10:36.022
They okay or what?

10:36.024 --> 10:37.624
No, they're not okay.

10:37.626 --> 10:40.360
Mr. Donovan was murdered
early this morning,

10:40.362 --> 10:41.995
and we suspect his
daughter Kelly

10:41.997 --> 10:43.663
was kidnapped
by the person

10:43.665 --> 10:45.131
who was driving
that blue Impala.

10:45.133 --> 10:47.200
What, you think Tommy
had something to do with it?

10:47.202 --> 10:48.401
Well, we don't know.
I mean,

10:48.403 --> 10:49.869
it's looking like maybe, yeah.

10:49.871 --> 10:51.738
You got a recent address for him?
Yeah.

10:51.740 --> 10:53.773
Right upstairs.
I rent him one room.

10:53.775 --> 10:55.375
Any family you know about?

10:55.377 --> 10:56.910
None that I know of.

10:56.912 --> 10:58.878
This no make sense.

10:58.880 --> 11:01.581
I know Tommy's done
some stupid things in the past,

11:01.583 --> 11:03.349
but... the boy's not a killer.

11:03.351 --> 11:04.784
Well, nobody's
a killer

11:04.786 --> 11:07.520
until they kill somebody, right?

11:10.658 --> 11:12.892
Tommy Fa'aloa was first arrested
when he was

11:12.894 --> 11:16.062
12 years old. Since then, he's
been locked up for assault,

11:16.064 --> 11:18.565
burglary and a couple of
strong-armed robberies.

11:18.567 --> 11:21.201
Right, but never anything
approaching the level of murder

11:21.203 --> 11:23.937
or kidnapping.
Well, something set this kid off.

11:23.939 --> 11:26.239
Just got off the
phone with CSU.

11:26.241 --> 11:28.007
Search of Tommy's
room came up empty.

11:28.009 --> 11:29.676
So I searched into
his juvie record

11:29.678 --> 11:33.079
to see if I could get
some info on his family.

11:33.081 --> 11:35.582
Check this out.

11:35.584 --> 11:37.083
It's not a pretty picture.

11:37.085 --> 11:39.752
Parents were charged
with meth trafficking in 2000

11:39.754 --> 11:41.621
when Tommy was just
seven years old.

11:41.623 --> 11:43.356
They were also charged
with child abuse

11:43.358 --> 11:45.091
when CPS found
evidence that Tommy

11:45.093 --> 11:47.127
was severely malnourished
and physically abused.

11:47.129 --> 11:48.695
He was put into
foster care.

11:48.697 --> 11:50.663
And when he
wasn't in jail,

11:50.665 --> 11:53.433
he bounced around from family
to family until he was 18.

11:53.435 --> 11:57.871
Okay. All right, Catherine,
listen, call Crime Stoppers.

11:57.873 --> 12:00.206
Have them get Tommy's photo
to all the local TV stations,

12:00.208 --> 12:02.375
and let's get a dedicated
TIPS line set up, too.

12:02.377 --> 12:04.944
Got it. Kono's also running down
past arrest associates

12:04.946 --> 12:06.779
and digging into
some phone records.

12:06.781 --> 12:09.482
Uh, we also flagged his
credit cards and bank accounts.

12:09.484 --> 12:11.417
So, if they're on this
island, we'll find them.

12:11.419 --> 12:12.752
Okay.

12:15.823 --> 12:17.590
Jerry, what are
you doing here,

12:17.592 --> 12:19.459
and why do you have
my father's toolbox?

12:19.461 --> 12:21.194
I found it in your garage.

12:21.196 --> 12:22.862
You found it. Okay, yes.
You found it.

12:22.864 --> 12:25.165
Because it-it wasn't lost.
That's where I keep it.

12:25.167 --> 12:27.734
In the garage. What were you
doing in my garage?

12:27.736 --> 12:29.169
Laundry.

12:29.171 --> 12:31.337
I thought I'd get a load in
before moving out.

12:31.339 --> 12:32.839
We should go.

12:33.874 --> 12:35.141
All right, Jerry,

12:35.143 --> 12:36.643
I thought...
I thought this morning

12:36.645 --> 12:38.511
we... we both agreed
that you were leaving.

12:38.513 --> 12:39.879
You were leaving
this morning, right?

12:39.881 --> 12:41.981
Well, I was.
But then I found

12:41.983 --> 12:44.117
this little anomaly.
It's a giant mystery

12:44.119 --> 12:46.686
that's been sitting
under your nose the whole time.

12:50.658 --> 12:53.726
Okay, Jerry, what's the mystery?

12:53.728 --> 12:55.361
What color is this?

12:55.363 --> 12:57.864
Well, it's red, Jerry.

12:57.866 --> 13:00.967
That's a good guess,
but it's actually American Rose.

13:00.969 --> 13:02.788
Okay.
You don't get it, do you?

13:02.789 --> 13:03.258
No.

13:03.283 --> 13:05.285
These toolboxes only came
in one color,

13:05.807 --> 13:08.341
Alizarin Crimson,
not American Rose.

13:08.343 --> 13:11.144
So the question is,
who would repaint a toolbox?

13:11.146 --> 13:13.213
I don't know. Who would repaint
a toolbox, Jerry?

13:13.215 --> 13:14.347
No one.

13:14.349 --> 13:17.050
Not unless they were trying
to hide something.

13:17.052 --> 13:19.018
Take a look at this.

13:20.221 --> 13:22.088
You'd be surprised
what you'd find

13:22.090 --> 13:25.391
with an active imagination
and a little scraping.

13:25.393 --> 13:27.894
This means something to you.

13:31.632 --> 13:36.803
Shelburne was a code name my
mother used as a CIA operative.

13:36.805 --> 13:38.805
The other two lines,
they don't mean anything to me.

13:38.807 --> 13:40.240
Hold on. Back up.

13:40.242 --> 13:42.342
Did you just say your mom worked
for the Company?

13:42.344 --> 13:43.710
Still does.

13:43.712 --> 13:46.279
Whoa. Info bomb.

13:46.281 --> 13:48.348
I need a sec to process this.

13:48.350 --> 13:50.383
Shelburne is misspelled.
There should be an "E"

13:50.385 --> 13:53.119
on the end of it.
It's probably a mistake.

13:53.121 --> 13:54.687
Probably not.

13:54.689 --> 13:56.789
Look, I know you got a lot
on your plate,

13:56.791 --> 13:59.292
but this is clearly some kind
of code or cipher.

13:59.294 --> 14:02.161
So if it's all right with you,
I'd like to dig a little deeper.

14:02.163 --> 14:04.097
I promise I'll stay out
of your hair.

14:04.965 --> 14:07.533
Okay. All right.

14:07.535 --> 14:08.868
See what you can do.

14:08.870 --> 14:10.670
Do me a favor: Keep it on the DL

14:10.672 --> 14:13.339
and, uh, keep me in the loop.
Of course.

14:13.341 --> 14:15.074
We're a team.

14:15.076 --> 14:16.242
Steve?

14:16.244 --> 14:17.543
Yeah.

14:18.679 --> 14:19.879
Hey.

14:20.714 --> 14:22.582
Thanks.

14:24.018 --> 14:26.519
Okay, so Tommy's cell
phone is turned off,

14:26.521 --> 14:29.088
making it untraceable.
No shock there.

14:29.090 --> 14:31.758
But we also ran Kelly's phone
and found this.

14:31.760 --> 14:32.992
Multiple calls

14:32.994 --> 14:34.894
between Tommy and Kelly
dating back three months.

14:34.896 --> 14:37.363
And they start the day after

14:37.365 --> 14:39.565
she took her car into the shop.
And they're not these two-minute

14:39.567 --> 14:42.001
"when will my car be ready?"
type of phone calls.

14:42.003 --> 14:43.803
Yeah, some of them
lasted over an hour.

14:43.805 --> 14:45.905
These two were in a relationship.
Yeah.

14:45.907 --> 14:47.140
That could
explain a lot.

14:47.142 --> 14:49.309
Young, innocent girl
falls for...

14:49.311 --> 14:51.511
older bad-boy type;
father disapproves,

14:51.513 --> 14:53.413
tries to break it up.
Yeah.

14:53.415 --> 14:56.082
And he pays for it
with his life.

15:06.627 --> 15:09.128
Hey, hey!
Tommy, look out!

15:09.130 --> 15:12.332
What the hell
are you doing to my car?

15:12.334 --> 15:14.967
Stop it!

15:16.870 --> 15:18.104
Stop it! You're gonna kill him!

15:18.106 --> 15:20.073
Tommy!

15:23.678 --> 15:25.244
Get in the car!

15:42.287 --> 15:45.587
<i>All units be advised,</i>

15:46.682 --> 15:49.317

16:11.975 --> 16:13.775

16:13.777 --> 16:14.909
Sergeant Lukela.
Hey, Duke,

16:14.911 --> 16:16.644
McGarrett. Listen to me,
we got eyes

16:16.646 --> 16:18.279
on the subject vehicle, okay?
He's headed northbound

16:18.281 --> 16:20.681
on Salt Lake
approaching Aloha Stadium.

16:20.683 --> 16:21.816
I'm gonna need roadblocks.

16:21.818 --> 16:23.117
<i>Copy that.</i>

16:37.499 --> 16:40.334
All right, we got cops.

16:40.336 --> 16:41.903
What?

16:41.905 --> 16:44.105
Don't-don't look.

16:44.107 --> 16:45.540
Don't turn around.

16:45.542 --> 16:48.042
Tommy, what are
you doing?

16:53.715 --> 16:55.650
What are you doing?

16:55.652 --> 16:57.018
Disconnecting the air bags.

17:02.758 --> 17:05.193
Son of a bitch. He's made us.
All right, put the pursuit out.

17:05.194 --> 17:07.461
<i>This is Lieutenant Kelly.</i>
<i>All units,</i>

17:07.463 --> 17:09.696
please be advised we are
in pursuit of the vehicle.

17:16.070 --> 17:18.573
Hang on.
What?

17:20.742 --> 17:21.642
Look out!

17:36.992 --> 17:38.259
You all right?

17:38.261 --> 17:40.194
Yeah.

17:40.196 --> 17:41.662
That's a pretty good trick.

17:41.664 --> 17:43.531
Son of a bitch.

17:45.334 --> 17:47.168
Ma?

17:55.110 --> 17:57.111
Ma?

17:57.946 --> 18:00.882
Ma, you home?

18:00.884 --> 18:02.750
Daniel?

18:02.752 --> 18:04.185
I thought you were at work.

18:04.187 --> 18:06.821
I was at work.
I called you 30 times.

18:06.823 --> 18:07.855
I was worried about you.

18:07.857 --> 18:09.156
I told you we're doing
something at 3:00.

18:09.158 --> 18:10.124
What's going on?

18:10.126 --> 18:11.292
Oh.

18:11.294 --> 18:13.394
Sorry.

18:13.396 --> 18:15.463
What are you doing?
What, are you crying?

18:15.465 --> 18:18.366
No. I was cutting onions before.

18:18.368 --> 18:19.734
Did you bring the onion
in the bathroom?

18:19.736 --> 18:20.835
Huh?

18:20.837 --> 18:22.003
No.

18:22.005 --> 18:23.804
Do you always have
to be a detective?

18:23.806 --> 18:26.774
Yeah. Pretty much.
It's what I do.

18:26.776 --> 18:29.977
You want to have a seat, Mom?

18:29.979 --> 18:32.713
Sure.

18:34.717 --> 18:37.051
Look, Ma, I know, uh...

18:37.053 --> 18:41.055
I know you went and saw
a... an attorney today.

18:41.057 --> 18:43.157
Oh, yeah? How do you know that?
Uh-huh.

18:43.159 --> 18:44.692
Because I'm a detective.

18:44.694 --> 18:47.628
What happened?

18:47.630 --> 18:48.696
What did he say?

18:48.698 --> 18:51.866
He said that it
would be rough,

18:51.868 --> 18:54.168
that we don't have a lot
of savings

18:54.170 --> 18:59.073
and that we would have
to sell the house.

18:59.975 --> 19:02.076
Well, that's...
that can't happen.

19:02.078 --> 19:04.345
I know that. All those memories
and everything.

19:04.347 --> 19:07.315
But...

19:07.317 --> 19:12.954
Daniel, I deserve someone
who appreciates me.

19:12.956 --> 19:17.091
I deserve to
be happy, too.

19:17.093 --> 19:19.760
And if it takes...

19:19.762 --> 19:23.497
getting a divorce
and selling the house,

19:23.499 --> 19:26.033
then so be it.

19:26.035 --> 19:28.502
That is on your father, not me.

19:28.504 --> 19:31.105
Okay. So... so what happened?
What-what...

19:31.107 --> 19:32.340
what'd you do?

19:32.342 --> 19:34.342
I mean, I have been
here for a month,

19:34.344 --> 19:37.378
and he hasn't
tried to call once.

19:37.380 --> 19:41.015
The silence, it speaks
volumes, doesn't it?

19:41.017 --> 19:43.617
Yes. Uh, but, Mom...

19:43.619 --> 19:48.522
So I went to the lawyer and
I filed for divorce today.

19:51.360 --> 19:53.361
I'm sorry.

19:53.363 --> 19:57.098
I know that hurts,
and I'm really sorry.

19:57.100 --> 19:59.266
It is not about me.
It is about you,

19:59.268 --> 20:00.835
and it's about you being happy.

20:00.837 --> 20:03.504
All right? So if you make
a decision that makes you happy,

20:03.506 --> 20:05.406
then I will support you
no matter what, okay?

20:05.408 --> 20:07.641
I promise.

20:08.477 --> 20:10.177
I love you.

20:10.179 --> 20:12.613
I love you, too.

20:12.615 --> 20:15.649
All right?

20:17.854 --> 20:21.255
Now, come on. I told you, I got
something nice planned today.

20:21.257 --> 20:22.723
Yeah, I don't really

20:22.725 --> 20:24.125
feel like going anywhere.

20:24.127 --> 20:27.094
Which is exactly why you should
do this. Trust me, okay?

20:27.096 --> 20:29.630
It's gonna be very nice.
I got you a-a beauty day,

20:29.632 --> 20:31.232
a day of beauty
at the SpaMakani.

20:31.234 --> 20:33.734
Okay? They're gonna do
all kinds of nice things,

20:33.736 --> 20:35.403
uh, set you up
really good

20:35.405 --> 20:38.172
and put a pretty smile
on that beautiful face, okay?

20:38.174 --> 20:40.207
You did that?
I did that, yes.

20:40.209 --> 20:43.010
Uh, all paid for by me,
your loving son,

20:43.012 --> 20:46.013
who you cannot
say no to.

20:46.015 --> 20:48.616
Uh, also it is gonna be too late
to get a refund,

20:48.618 --> 20:51.752
so if you could. Come on.
It'll be really nice.

20:51.754 --> 20:54.288
Okay, I'll do that for you.

20:54.290 --> 20:59.226
You know, your father could
learn a few things from you.

20:59.228 --> 21:01.328
Uh, we got
about ten minutes, though.

21:01.330 --> 21:02.563
Let's go, okay?

21:16.211 --> 21:19.013
You guys okay?
Oh, a little banged up.

21:19.015 --> 21:20.648
Egos a little bruised,
but we'll live.

21:20.650 --> 21:22.368
They found the car
ditched a couple of miles away.

21:22.579 --> 21:24.259
Probably jacked another
set of wheels by now, huh?

21:24.284 --> 21:25.588
I'd say so.

21:25.589 --> 21:26.653
How's Tommy's latest victim?

21:26.654 --> 21:28.921
GSW to the thigh,
just missed the femoral artery,

21:28.923 --> 21:30.189
but he's in stable condition.

21:30.191 --> 21:31.653
You said on the phone
you had some other news?

21:31.678 --> 21:32.792
Yeah.

21:32.793 --> 21:34.894
The phone company got back to me
with the incoming

21:34.896 --> 21:36.528
and outgoing call records
on Donovan's home phone.

21:36.530 --> 21:39.431
There was a phone call placed
to Tommy's cell phone

21:39.433 --> 21:42.434
30 minutes before
Donovan was killed.

21:42.436 --> 21:45.871
Wait a minute. So, this whole
thing could have been planned?

21:45.873 --> 21:47.439
Maybe, but then
why would Tommy need

21:47.441 --> 21:49.141
to force his way in
with a crowbar

21:49.143 --> 21:51.110
if Kelly was there
to let him in?

22:04.257 --> 22:05.891
Hey.

22:05.893 --> 22:08.260
Oh. Uh, I-I know
what you're thinking.

22:08.262 --> 22:09.428
<i>A Beautiful Mind.</i>

22:09.430 --> 22:10.562
I get it,
but don't worry.

22:10.564 --> 22:11.864
The marker's erasable,

22:11.866 --> 22:13.365
and I can have all this
cleaned up in five minutes.

22:13.367 --> 22:14.567
You won't even
know I was here.

22:14.568 --> 22:15.534
What is all this stuff?

22:15.536 --> 22:16.568
Well, I was thinking
about what you said

22:16.570 --> 22:18.537
about "Shelburn"
being misspelled.

22:18.539 --> 22:19.905
You see, a lot
of codes use ciphers

22:19.907 --> 22:22.408
that don't repeat letters.
"Shelburne"

22:22.410 --> 22:25.244
has two E's, but on the toolbox,
there's only one.

22:25.246 --> 22:26.712
And one of the ciphers

22:26.714 --> 22:29.315
that eliminates repeat letters
is called "Polybius Square."

22:29.317 --> 22:32.017
I think that's what
the "PS" stands for.

22:32.019 --> 22:33.185
Polybius Square.

22:33.187 --> 22:34.586
Boom. You see that?

22:34.588 --> 22:36.789
You and me finishing
each other's sentences.

22:36.791 --> 22:38.657
Well, you just...
you just told me what...

22:38.659 --> 22:39.992
Oh. All right,
I got it.

22:39.994 --> 22:41.794
Can we...? I don't have
all day, Jerry, is all.

22:41.796 --> 22:43.429
Copy that, partner.

22:43.431 --> 22:45.531
I constructed this

22:45.533 --> 22:50.336
Polybius Square, and I used
the code name Shelburn

22:50.338 --> 22:52.371
to decipher the two
other letter sequences

22:52.373 --> 22:55.541
on the tool box,
and it gave me these numbers.

22:55.543 --> 22:57.242
It's pretty cool, right?
Sure.

22:57.244 --> 22:58.510
Yeah, yeah,
I mean, it'd be cooler

22:58.512 --> 23:00.145
if I knew
what the numbers meant, though?

23:00.981 --> 23:03.482
The "Q" in the first sequence is

23:03.484 --> 23:04.917
actually the Greek symbol phi.

23:04.919 --> 23:06.352
Phi.
Which...

23:06.354 --> 23:08.787
Phi, which is sometimes used
to denote latitude.

23:08.789 --> 23:10.489
Bingo.

23:10.491 --> 23:12.057
These are
geographic coordinates?

23:12.059 --> 23:14.727
Exactly.

23:15.729 --> 23:17.863
And e mystery
location is...

23:19.699 --> 23:21.500
Cambodia.

23:21.502 --> 23:23.769
Your dad have any connection
to that part of the world?

23:23.771 --> 23:25.771
I mean, he served
in Vietnam in '68,

23:25.773 --> 23:27.172
but my mom is Shelburne.

23:27.174 --> 23:29.008
She hadn't even met my dad
in '68.

23:29.010 --> 23:31.977
So what does any of this have
to do with her?

23:36.449 --> 23:38.717
I just can't believe
this is happening.

23:38.719 --> 23:41.253
I mean, I didn't like Tommy.

23:41.255 --> 23:43.188
I told Kelly that.

23:43.190 --> 23:45.557
But I didn't think
he'd ever kill her father.

23:45.559 --> 23:47.192
Why didn't you
like Tommy?

23:47.194 --> 23:50.262
He was older than her,
and just seemed sketchy.

23:50.264 --> 23:52.598
Kelly said
he was even in prison.

23:52.600 --> 23:54.500
I told her to dump him.

23:54.502 --> 23:57.503
I mean, she could have any guy
she wanted at school.

23:57.505 --> 23:59.338
But Tommy had her convinced

23:59.340 --> 24:01.740
he was trying
to turn his life around.

24:01.742 --> 24:04.276
I didn't buy it.

24:04.278 --> 24:05.911
Amy, did Kelly ever mention

24:05.913 --> 24:07.479
the two of them
running away together?

24:07.481 --> 24:08.714
Like, where they might go?

24:08.716 --> 24:11.216
No, never.

24:11.218 --> 24:14.553
I just don't get
why she liked him.

24:14.555 --> 24:17.689
All Tommy ever did was make
her life more difficult at home.

24:17.691 --> 24:19.324
What do you mean?

24:19.326 --> 24:21.060
Nothing.

24:21.062 --> 24:23.295
I just...

24:23.297 --> 24:25.130
you know.

24:25.132 --> 24:27.132
It caused a lot of problems.

24:28.268 --> 24:31.136
Amy, I'm just trying
to get Kelly home safe,

24:31.138 --> 24:34.173
so if you know anything
that can help me do that,

24:34.175 --> 24:36.075
you need to tell me.

24:36.077 --> 24:38.544
He was hitting her.

24:38.546 --> 24:39.978
Tommy?

24:41.247 --> 24:43.682
No. Her dad.

24:46.186 --> 24:49.021
So, I was able to pull these
images from Kelly's computer.

24:49.023 --> 24:51.190
According to her
best friend, Amy,

24:51.192 --> 24:53.058
Russell Donovan
was an overprotective,

24:53.060 --> 24:55.194
controlling father
who had a bad temper.

24:55.196 --> 24:57.329
Right, and, apparently,
he liked to use his fists.

24:57.331 --> 25:01.200
Yeah, and Kelly wasn't just
documenting it with pictures.

25:01.202 --> 25:03.035
CSU was able
to recover this journal

25:03.037 --> 25:04.536
during a search of her room.

25:04.538 --> 25:05.704
She writes about incidents
of abuse

25:05.706 --> 25:07.539
dating all the way back
to when she was 11.

25:08.475 --> 25:09.675
It's, uh,
some pretty chilling stuff.

25:09.677 --> 25:11.677
That's what her and Tommy
had in common.

25:11.679 --> 25:13.378
They were both victims of abuse.

25:13.380 --> 25:16.281
These photos look
like they were taken recently.

25:16.283 --> 25:17.749
Well, maybe Kelly finally got
the courage

25:17.751 --> 25:19.384
to take a stand
against her father

25:19.386 --> 25:21.120
and she was
gathering evidence

25:21.122 --> 25:22.354
to make a case against him.

25:22.356 --> 25:23.922
So, Kelly

25:23.924 --> 25:26.425
gets into a beef
with her father, she threatens

25:26.427 --> 25:27.960
to turn him in,
he gets rough with her,

25:27.962 --> 25:29.428
she goes, and she calls Tommy.

25:29.430 --> 25:30.696
Tommy shows up,

25:30.698 --> 25:33.732
forces his way in
and puts a bullet into

25:33.734 --> 25:34.867
Donovan's chest.

25:34.869 --> 25:36.135
Maybe not.

25:36.137 --> 25:37.569
Ballistics report
just came back,

25:37.571 --> 25:39.872
and the slug that Max took out
of Russell Donovan's body

25:39.874 --> 25:42.307
was an exact match
to a nine-millimeter Glock

25:42.309 --> 25:43.809
that was registered to him.

25:44.677 --> 25:46.044
Donovan was murdered
with his own gun.

25:46.046 --> 25:48.413
So, Tommy didn't
go there intending

25:48.415 --> 25:50.516
- to murder Kelly's father.
- No.

25:50.518 --> 25:52.684
He went there
intending to save her.

26:03.326 --> 26:05.427
All right, that's it.

26:05.429 --> 26:06.729
There's nobody left inside

26:06.731 --> 26:08.464
but the clerk.

26:08.466 --> 26:13.168
Remember, honk twice
if there's trouble.

26:13.170 --> 26:15.537
Look, are you sure
you want to do this?

26:15.539 --> 26:17.573
We're gonna need the cash if
we want to get off this rock.

26:17.575 --> 26:19.842
Right.

26:19.844 --> 26:21.677
Tommy, wait.

26:21.679 --> 26:24.079
I love you.

26:31.021 --> 26:33.088
I'll be right back.

26:33.090 --> 26:35.357
Okay.

26:46.703 --> 26:48.337
Liquor store? How long ago?

26:48.339 --> 26:50.939
Couple of minutes. Clerk I.D.'d
the stickup man as Tommy.

26:50.941 --> 26:52.741
Anybody hurt?
No, not this time.

26:52.743 --> 26:55.511
They fled south
on Kaukohua Road in a Cadillac

26:55.513 --> 26:57.746
that was reported stolen
in the area a little while ago.

26:57.748 --> 27:00.115
Call HPD, have them
get a helo in the air.

27:00.117 --> 27:01.784
I want roadblocks
in a 15-mile radius,

27:01.786 --> 27:02.885
360-degree perimeter.

27:02.887 --> 27:04.720
The whole place needs
to be locked down.

27:04.722 --> 27:06.789
No one gets away this time.
Copy.

27:07.624 --> 27:10.359
There's over 900 bucks here.

27:10.361 --> 27:12.795
Yeah. Should be enough
to lay low

27:12.797 --> 27:15.164
till we can make the move
to the mainland.

27:16.066 --> 27:18.500
We got to ditch this
car, get off the road.

27:18.502 --> 27:21.270
Gonna be lots of cops out
there looking for us, you know?

27:24.674 --> 27:26.842
Were you scared?

27:27.911 --> 27:31.113
Yeah. Yeah, I was.

27:31.115 --> 27:33.816
I'm just glad
the clerk didn't get stupid.

27:33.818 --> 27:35.818
And what if he did?

27:35.820 --> 27:38.120
Would you have shot him, too?

27:42.492 --> 27:43.859
Only if I had to.

27:58.575 --> 28:00.342
<i>3 Bravo 233 to Central.</i>

28:00.344 --> 28:02.945
<i>Be advised, we are in pursuit</i>
<i>of a Code-10 vehicle</i>

28:02.947 --> 28:05.047
with two occupants. The subject
<i>vehicle now headed southbound</i>

28:05.049 --> 28:07.082
<i>on the 1500 block</i>
<i>of Kapiolani Boulevard...</i>

28:07.084 --> 28:09.651
Slow down! Slow... What's wrong with you?
What's the matter?

28:09.653 --> 28:11.553
What's the matter with you?

28:13.491 --> 28:16.191
Slow down!
What are you talking about?

28:16.193 --> 28:18.727
It's like your first time
on a roller coaster.

28:18.729 --> 28:20.596
N-No. Roller coasters
aren't this scary, okay?

28:20.598 --> 28:22.030
This is petrifying.
Danny, Danny, Danny, Danny!

28:22.032 --> 28:25.167
What?
We've done this 118 times.

28:25.169 --> 28:26.969
And I have been petrified
118 times.

28:26.971 --> 28:28.036
Okay? I'm just verbalizing.

28:28.038 --> 28:29.304
Verbalizing?

28:29.306 --> 28:30.906
Look, yes, it means
to-to be verbal.

28:30.908 --> 28:32.074
I know what it means.

28:32.076 --> 28:33.976
3 Bravo 233 to all units,

28:33.978 --> 28:36.078
be advised suspect vehicle
is now on Ilalo Street

28:36.080 --> 28:37.713
approaching Kakaako.
Okay, we're about five minutes out,

28:37.715 --> 28:38.814
assuming we make it
there at all.

28:38.816 --> 28:40.015
Kono, what do you got?

28:40.017 --> 28:41.316
A pretty good theory, I think.

28:41.318 --> 28:43.385
You know those photos
on Kelly's computer of abuse?

28:43.387 --> 28:44.653
They're not real.

28:44.655 --> 28:46.288
The digital time stamp data

28:46.290 --> 28:48.357
on the photos didn't match with
the details in the journal,

28:48.359 --> 28:50.459
so we took a closer
look at everything.

28:50.461 --> 28:52.294
Max examined the photos
of Kelly's injuries,

28:52.296 --> 28:53.629
and he's convinced
they were self-inflicted.

28:53.631 --> 28:54.797
Wait a minute.

28:54.799 --> 28:56.165
She faked the abuse.
Why would she do that?

28:56.167 --> 28:57.332
To convince Tommy

28:57.334 --> 28:58.534
she was being abused,

28:58.536 --> 29:00.435
and then manipulate him
into killing her father.

29:00.437 --> 29:02.037
We got any evidence
to back this up?

29:02.039 --> 29:04.840
Four months ago, Kelly paid for
access to a commercial database,

29:04.842 --> 29:06.108
and she used it to run

29:06.110 --> 29:07.776
a criminal history check
on Tommy Fa'aloa.

29:07.778 --> 29:10.746
Hold on. That's-that's a month
before she met him at the shop.

29:10.748 --> 29:11.547
That's right.

29:11.549 --> 29:13.182
She used him, Steve.

29:13.184 --> 29:14.983
She needed someone
to get rid of her father,

29:14.985 --> 29:16.952
and Tommy fit the bill
perfectly.

29:16.954 --> 29:20.389
Parolee with a temper
and a violent criminal past,

29:20.391 --> 29:21.824
no girlfriend on the
island, no family.

29:21.826 --> 29:23.058
He was the perfect candidate.

29:23.060 --> 29:24.259
If she wasn't being abused,

29:24.261 --> 29:26.094
why would she want
to murder her own father?

29:26.096 --> 29:27.830
Money. Life insurance.

29:27.832 --> 29:29.965
Her father had
a platinum policy, and

29:29.967 --> 29:32.868
Kelly was
the sole beneficiary.

29:35.973 --> 29:38.273
Hold on.

29:55.892 --> 29:58.260
What are we gonna do?

30:18.147 --> 30:19.114
Tommy!

30:29.426 --> 30:30.726
Throw out your weapon

30:30.728 --> 30:34.830
and place your hands on
the dashboard in front of you.

30:36.766 --> 30:38.967
This is your last warning.

30:38.969 --> 30:41.003
Throw your weapon from the car

30:41.005 --> 30:42.905
and place your hands
on the dashboard.

30:45.976 --> 30:50.012
Duke? Duke?

30:50.014 --> 30:51.780
Hold your fire. Hold your fire.

30:51.782 --> 30:53.315
Nobody fires until
I give the order.

30:53.317 --> 30:55.317
Damn!

30:55.319 --> 30:57.286
I'm sorry.

30:57.288 --> 30:59.488
I just wanted to stop
him from hurting you.

31:00.823 --> 31:02.524
It wasn't supposed
to be like this.

31:08.398 --> 31:10.365
No.

31:10.367 --> 31:12.868
Actually, it was.

31:16.039 --> 31:16.872
Help!

31:16.874 --> 31:18.607
Help! He has a gun!

31:20.076 --> 31:21.176
No! Kelly, wait!

31:21.178 --> 31:23.278
Gun! Gun!
Hold your fire!

31:23.280 --> 31:24.880
Put the gun down!
Get away from me!

31:24.882 --> 31:26.362
Put the gun down!
Hold your fire!

31:29.118 --> 31:30.319
Cease fire!

31:31.621 --> 31:33.155
Cease fire!

31:33.157 --> 31:35.390
Cease fire.

31:36.926 --> 31:38.493
Cease fire!

31:44.834 --> 31:47.035
Tommy. Hang in
there, kid.

31:48.471 --> 31:49.972
All right?
You hang in there.

31:49.974 --> 31:52.708
Paramedic here right now!
Get me a paramedic!

32:00.680 --> 32:03.081
Hello?

32:03.083 --> 32:07.319
Hey... if you can hear me,
I need to talk to somebody.

32:07.321 --> 32:09.254
Look, I'm not supposed
to be here.

32:09.256 --> 32:11.089
There's been
some kind of mistake.

32:14.026 --> 32:15.660
Oh, thank God.

32:16.629 --> 32:18.497
Look, there's been
some kind of mix-up.

32:18.499 --> 32:20.632
I shouldn't be here.

32:20.634 --> 32:22.868
No. You're right where
you belong, Kelly.

32:22.870 --> 32:24.569
You better get used to it,
'cause you're

32:24.571 --> 32:26.805
gonna be in a place like this
for a very long time.

32:26.807 --> 32:30.408
Who are you?
What-what are you talking about?

32:30.410 --> 32:32.144
I'm a victim.

32:32.146 --> 32:33.945
You know, a
lot of people

32:33.947 --> 32:35.347
have sat in that chair--

32:35.349 --> 32:38.550
murderers, thieves...

32:38.552 --> 32:40.185
terrorists.

32:40.187 --> 32:43.288
You know what makes
most of them... so dangerous?

32:43.290 --> 32:46.992
It's the same thing
that makes you so dangerous.

32:46.994 --> 32:49.694
The complete lack
of a conscience.

32:49.696 --> 32:53.064
The inability to feel remorse.

32:53.066 --> 32:55.433
I was kidnapped.

32:56.602 --> 33:00.338
My father was murdered.
You're not a victim.

33:00.340 --> 33:03.308
And Tommy Fa'aloa...

33:03.310 --> 33:05.911
he wasn't your boyfriend.

33:05.913 --> 33:07.946
He was your mark.

33:07.948 --> 33:11.383
And now he's dead.

33:11.385 --> 33:13.652
You knew everything
about him,

33:13.654 --> 33:15.086
didn't you?

33:15.088 --> 33:17.823
You knew where he was from.

33:17.825 --> 33:20.125
You knew what he did.

33:22.428 --> 33:23.528
You handpicked that kid.

33:23.530 --> 33:26.131
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

33:26.133 --> 33:28.500
You found someone who
was capable of killing,

33:28.502 --> 33:32.370
someone who had nothing to lose
and no one to love,

33:32.372 --> 33:34.239
and then you
convinced him

33:34.241 --> 33:36.408
that your father
was abusing you.

33:36.410 --> 33:38.977
You see, Tommy...

33:38.979 --> 33:42.247
Tommy thought he was
protecting you from a monster.

33:42.249 --> 33:45.283
But as it
turns out...

33:45.285 --> 33:47.385
the monster's you.

33:47.387 --> 33:49.521
Kelly, you know

33:49.523 --> 33:51.089
what a sociopath is?

33:51.924 --> 33:53.892
You think I'm stupid?

33:54.727 --> 33:55.927
No.

33:55.929 --> 33:57.762
On the contrary,
I think you're brilliantly evil.

33:57.764 --> 34:00.365
I'm just glad we were able
to stop you when we did,

34:00.367 --> 34:02.367
'cause left alone,
who knows how many bodies

34:02.369 --> 34:03.768
would've been left in your wake?

34:03.770 --> 34:05.203
I want a lawyer.

34:05.205 --> 34:07.572
Right now.
And I want my phone call.

34:07.574 --> 34:09.373
I get a phone call!

34:10.109 --> 34:12.444
Kelly!

34:12.446 --> 34:15.112
You get nothing.

34:20.286 --> 34:23.288
That's your father's
million-dollar

34:23.290 --> 34:25.422
life insurance policy.

34:25.425 --> 34:27.058
He was a real planner, your dad.

34:27.060 --> 34:29.594
He wanted to make sure
you were taken care of

34:29.596 --> 34:31.897
in case anything
were to ever happen to him.

34:31.899 --> 34:34.065
But you knew that, didn't you?
What you didn't know

34:34.067 --> 34:36.434
is that he recently let
the policy lapse.

34:36.436 --> 34:39.304
He stopped paying
the premium.

34:40.973 --> 34:42.574
You're lying.

34:42.576 --> 34:44.609
No, she's not.

34:44.610 --> 34:46.610
You see, your dad
had to make a choice--

34:46.612 --> 34:48.679
start saving
for your college education

34:48.681 --> 34:50.748
or keep paying this premium.

34:50.751 --> 34:53.918
He couldn't afford both.

34:53.920 --> 34:56.755
Chose your education.

34:58.925 --> 35:02.494
So you see, Kelly,
it's like I said.

35:04.330 --> 35:06.698
You get nothing.

35:06.700 --> 35:08.800
Happy reading.

35:41.534 --> 35:42.767
Wow, Ma.

35:42.769 --> 35:44.669
Check you out.
You look amazing.

35:44.671 --> 35:46.237
Thank you.

35:46.239 --> 35:48.907
You look very nice yourself.
Why are you all dressed up?

35:48.909 --> 35:50.806
That's a fantastic question.
Come on, I'll show you.

35:50.831 --> 35:52.111
Okay.

35:52.112 --> 35:54.446
You really look good.
What are you up to, Daniel?

35:54.448 --> 35:55.680
Wait for it, Ma.

35:56.515 --> 35:58.550
This way, lady.

35:58.552 --> 36:00.585
Whoa, what is all of this?

36:02.889 --> 36:06.524
Uh, the table is right this way.

36:06.526 --> 36:08.793
Silvio's?

36:08.795 --> 36:11.396
Yeah.
That's where your father and I...

36:11.398 --> 36:13.498
Had your first date, yeah.
This is all authentic.

36:13.500 --> 36:14.699
This is
the original table

36:14.701 --> 36:17.802
that you guys sat at.
Um, had it all shipped in.

36:17.804 --> 36:20.538
So that's what
the boxes were?

36:20.540 --> 36:22.874
Yeah. This is...
this is the last of it.

36:24.076 --> 36:26.177
It's amazing, but
how did you do this?

36:26.179 --> 36:27.612
You were at work all day,
weren't you?

36:27.614 --> 36:29.014
I did a little, uh, preplanning.

36:29.016 --> 36:31.316
Uh, I took care
of all the finances,

36:31.318 --> 36:34.252
and, uh, my beautiful sisters
back in Jersey, they took care

36:34.254 --> 36:35.687
of the purchasing
and the shipping.

36:35.689 --> 36:38.723
And I even, uh, imported
a thickheaded consultant

36:38.725 --> 36:39.958
from the mainland

36:39.960 --> 36:41.860
to make sure I got
all the details just right.

36:41.862 --> 36:42.861
Okay.

36:52.605 --> 36:54.272
Hi, Eddie.

36:54.274 --> 36:57.208
Hello, Clara.

36:58.577 --> 36:59.944
Okay, you guys got
some stuff to discuss.

36:59.946 --> 37:01.646
I'm gonna go check
on the kitchen.

37:01.648 --> 37:03.848
Okay.

37:17.296 --> 37:19.497
Thank you.

37:27.173 --> 37:29.674
You really hurt me, you know.

37:29.676 --> 37:32.143
I'm sorry.

37:33.813 --> 37:35.280
I love you and...

37:35.282 --> 37:38.149
I miss you
and I want you to come home.

37:40.854 --> 37:42.153
Well, that's not gonna do it.

37:42.155 --> 37:44.222
You can't just come here
and say you're sorry

37:44.224 --> 37:46.324
and expect me
to go running back home.

37:47.293 --> 37:49.094
Why didn't you call me?
I must have had

37:49.096 --> 37:52.597
the phone in my hand at least
a dozen times, I swear I did,

37:52.599 --> 37:54.032
but...
But what?

37:55.969 --> 37:58.169
I was...

37:58.171 --> 38:00.004
embarrassed...

38:00.006 --> 38:02.006
and ashamed.

38:02.008 --> 38:03.875
I was confused.

38:03.877 --> 38:06.144
Confused about what?

38:06.146 --> 38:07.278
About everything.

38:07.280 --> 38:10.348
You see, for more
than half of my life,

38:10.350 --> 38:12.851
that firehouse has been...

38:12.853 --> 38:14.486
my world.

38:14.488 --> 38:17.555
I had someplace
to go every day.

38:17.557 --> 38:19.624
I had a purpose.

38:19.626 --> 38:22.327
Then...

38:22.329 --> 38:25.363
one day, I just...

38:25.365 --> 38:27.332
age out.

38:27.334 --> 38:30.802
And... they throw
me a nice dinner

38:30.804 --> 38:33.571
and they send me on my way
with a shiny plaque.

38:33.573 --> 38:36.107
You have no idea

38:36.109 --> 38:40.011
what it's like to have something
like that taken away...

38:40.013 --> 38:41.913
to-to feel like...

38:41.915 --> 38:45.016
to feel like you
just don't matter anymore.

38:45.018 --> 38:46.584
Oh, you think so?

38:46.586 --> 38:49.454
I know exactly
what it feels like

38:49.456 --> 38:51.689
to not matter anymore.

38:51.691 --> 38:53.558
But I missed you,

38:53.560 --> 38:55.994
I missed you all the time,

38:55.996 --> 38:57.328
and I really thought

38:57.330 --> 39:00.465
that when you retired,
that it would be our time again.

39:00.467 --> 39:02.100
We wouldn't
have the kids,

39:02.102 --> 39:04.502
and we can fall in love
all over again

39:04.504 --> 39:09.307
and be romantic and be a couple
and have a good time.

39:09.309 --> 39:14.078
But you made me feel like
I didn't matter... at all.

39:14.080 --> 39:16.548
Oh, Clara, that's not true.

39:16.550 --> 39:18.149
I realize that...

39:18.151 --> 39:20.818
you're all that matters.

39:20.820 --> 39:22.086
If I could,

39:22.088 --> 39:24.255
I'd go back
and I would treat you

39:24.257 --> 39:26.357
like the princess that you are.

39:35.167 --> 39:37.068
I, uh...

39:37.070 --> 39:39.938
I came here to get you back.

39:41.774 --> 39:44.008
And I'm not leaving without you.

39:46.545 --> 39:49.280
'Cause the truth is,

39:49.282 --> 39:51.649
I'm nothing without you.

40:00.326 --> 40:02.260
I love you.

40:05.331 --> 40:06.731
May I take your order?

40:06.733 --> 40:09.133
What do you recommend,
young lady?

40:09.135 --> 40:12.770
Um... well, we're out of
everything but pizza.

40:12.772 --> 40:14.272
Okay.

40:14.274 --> 40:17.442
Well, then,
I guess it's pizza.

40:17.444 --> 40:18.476
One pizza.

40:18.478 --> 40:20.044
Would you like wine with dinner?

40:20.046 --> 40:22.013
Oh, sure.
Definitely.

40:22.015 --> 40:26.017
Daddy won't let me
open it by myself.

40:27.453 --> 40:29.053
Enjoy.

40:29.055 --> 40:30.755
Thank you, baby.

40:33.626 --> 40:34.892
How we looking out there?

40:34.894 --> 40:35.927
I think it's working.

40:35.929 --> 40:37.395
Yeah?

40:37.397 --> 40:38.730
Have a look.

41:01.787 --> 41:03.655
What are we doing here?

41:03.657 --> 41:06.424
Joe White told me
you were the man to see,

41:06.426 --> 41:07.625
uh, regarding Doris.

41:07.627 --> 41:10.028
And I'll tell you the
same thing I told him.

41:10.030 --> 41:12.697
The location of Agency
assets is classified.

41:12.699 --> 41:15.166
I can't change the rules just
because it's your mother.

41:15.168 --> 41:16.868
I'm not asking you
to tell me where she is.

41:16.870 --> 41:20.038
Look, I'm compromising my
position with the Agency

41:20.040 --> 41:22.440
even acknowledging
she's an active asset.

41:22.442 --> 41:25.510
So why don't you tell me exactly
what it is that you want?

41:33.686 --> 41:35.186
Looks like an empty field.

41:35.188 --> 41:37.155
Yeah, we both know
it's more than that.

41:37.157 --> 41:39.223
Walk away, Commander.

41:39.225 --> 41:40.558
Well, you know
I'm not going to do that,

41:40.560 --> 41:41.893
so why don't you, uh,
save me the trouble

41:41.895 --> 41:43.394
and tell me
what's in this field?

41:43.396 --> 41:44.762
And you know that's classified.

41:44.764 --> 41:47.031
If I told you, I'd be
violating operational security.

41:47.033 --> 41:48.366
What's one more violation?

41:48.368 --> 41:50.735
You gotta be kidding me.
You wore a wire?

41:50.737 --> 41:52.804
The recording gets destroyed

41:52.806 --> 41:55.173
right after you tell me
what's in this field.

41:57.109 --> 41:58.943
It's a grave.

41:58.945 --> 42:01.012
It's a grave. Okay.
Whose grave? Who's buried here?

42:01.014 --> 42:02.647
I'm done talking.

42:02.649 --> 42:04.215
I've already said enough.

42:04.217 --> 42:05.683
Listen to me.

42:05.685 --> 42:07.251
What you say here stays here.

42:07.253 --> 42:08.619
It stays between us.

42:08.621 --> 42:10.955
I'm not going to do anything
to jeopardize your career.

42:12.858 --> 42:15.693
It's not my career
that I'm worried about.
