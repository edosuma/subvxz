[DOOR OPENS]

38:44.820 --> 38:46.993
[WALT]: How much did you tell Luz?

38:46.994 --> 38:49.819
Just that it's a good job.

38:49.820 --> 38:53.120
She's worried enough as it is.

38:59.714 --> 39:01.300
Take care.

39:06.400 --> 39:09.010
That Ken guy, he being nice to you?

39:18.380 --> 39:21.570
You're going to look so
handsome in uniform.

39:23.267 --> 39:24.531
We'll see after Luz.

39:25.824 --> 39:28.785
Pop will come around.

39:37.002 --> 39:40.088
I found a woman who
was making dresses...

39:40.100 --> 39:42.939
in case you get sick
of wearing my shirts.

[LAUGHING]

39:55.540 --> 39:57.919
How did you pay for it?

39:57.920 --> 40:00.691
I... traded my camera for it.

40:00.692 --> 40:03.530
Chester...

Chester!

40:45.980 --> 40:47.819
What's she doing?

40:47.820 --> 40:49.679
If Chester dies and there's no body,

40:49.680 --> 40:51.479
she can cremate the hair.

40:51.480 --> 40:53.740
Give him a proper burial.

Do you know if there's
another doctor at the camp?

41:35.328 --> 41:37.038
Why? What's wrong?

41:41.390 --> 41:43.080
I feel fine,

41:43.090 --> 41:46.256
but I don't want to see
Dr. Kitamura again.

41:47.960 --> 41:51.599
A woman in the <i> mesu</i>
told me about a midwife,

41:51.600 --> 41:54.619
in the new barracks, north
of the guard tower.

41:54.620 --> 41:56.057
Why don't I come with you?

41:56.058 --> 41:57.779
I can make it.

Can you tell me if the head...

42:32.320 --> 42:33.940
Is it down?

42:33.950 --> 42:36.555
- The head... down?
