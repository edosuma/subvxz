you can't wear these.

from the Alvarez case?

03:37.740 --> 03:38.839
[Donna] I called several times.

03:38.841 --> 03:40.909
She's not answering the phone.

03:40.911 --> 03:42.843
I'm taking patrol over there.
Something's up at that house.

03:42.845 --> 03:44.278
Patricia Alvarez?

03:44.280 --> 03:45.747
Why? What's going on?

03:45.749 --> 03:47.115
We got a call from the school.

03:47.117 --> 03:48.849
Alvarez boys
aren't going to class again.

03:48.851 --> 03:50.184
Okay, well,
why is Donna going over there?

03:50.186 --> 03:51.952
I transferred
some of your cases.

03:51.954 --> 03:53.121
Now, Donna has more energy.

03:53.123 --> 03:54.723
- More energy?
- And more time.

03:54.725 --> 03:57.058
She doesn't have the outside
responsibilities you have.

03:57.060 --> 03:59.260
- She has no kids.
- She has support at home.

03:59.262 --> 04:00.764

04:03.066 --> 04:06.735

All right? But believe me,
we all understand.

04:09.373 --> 04:10.804
Do you?

04:10.806 --> 04:12.643
Doesn't really feel like it.

04:13.876 --> 04:15.643
Less time here,
more time at home

04:15.645 --> 04:16.844
might not be such a bad thing.

04:16.846 --> 04:19.113
Patricia Alvarez isn't gonna
talk to someone like Donna.

04:19.115 --> 04:20.315
"Someone like Donna"?

04:20.317 --> 04:22.217
I just mean that she knows me.

I've been with that family
for four years.

04:24.021 --> 04:26.154
I've seen those kids grow up.
Patricia trusts me.

04:26.156 --> 04:27.856
She knows that I'm a mom, too.

04:27.858 --> 04:29.293
The job is to do
what's best for the kids.

04:30.324 --> 04:31.825
Okay, okay, look.
Just keep the case.

04:31.827 --> 04:33.861
Once you get done here,
check in with patrol.

04:33.863 --> 04:36.296
- I don't need patrol.
- Take an officer.

04:36.298 --> 04:38.168
That's not a request.

04:39.803 --> 04:40.935
[officer] I'm sorry.

04:40.937 --> 04:43.371
[Anna] You know what, I can
handle this myself, okay?

Are the boys home?

05:00.356 --> 05:02.823
- Ma'am, open the door.
- No, that's okay.

05:02.825 --> 05:04.758
Just give us a second.

05:04.760 --> 05:07.195
Patricia, where are the boys?

05:07.197 --> 05:09.029
They're somewhere safe, Anna.

05:09.031 --> 05:10.864
[Anna] Oh.

05:10.866 --> 05:12.433
Look, I don't know
what's going on,

05:12.435 --> 05:14.301
but I might be your best bet
at clearing things up.

05:14.303 --> 05:16.003
So why don't you let me in

05:16.005 --> 05:19.275
and you can show me that
they're safe, like you said?

05:21.945 --> 05:24.746
No, he doesn't even
have to come inside.

05:24.748 --> 05:27.351
Okay? Why don't you
just let me in?

05:28.250 --> 05:29.217
[door chain unfastens]

05:29.219 --> 05:31.820
Uh-uh. Promised her
that I'd go in alone.

05:31.822 --> 05:34.289
Yeah, out of respect
for Officer Garcia.

05:34.291 --> 05:36.056
Your husband
was a police officer.

05:36.058 --> 05:38.294
You think he'd let you
go in there alone?

05:39.161 --> 05:40.330
Yeah, I do.

05:42.164 --> 05:43.964
[sighs] I'll be right here.

[Tomas] No.

10:04.493 --> 10:06.095
It wasn't her.

Who did you try to stop?

17:26.568 --> 17:27.970
<i>La Llorona.</i>

[Chris shuddering]

19:51.980 --> 19:53.916

19:59.354 --> 20:00.923

20:04.026 --> 20:05.695
[La Llorona] <i>Nino!</i>

20:13.169 --> 20:15.872

20:16.138 --> 20:17.771
Open!

20:31.286 --> 20:32.886
[gasping]

20:32.888 --> 20:34.220
What's going on?

20:34.222 --> 20:35.691
Didn't you see her?

20:36.025 --> 20:37.093
Who?

20:47.737 --> 20:49.038

Chris, what's going on?

21:04.152 --> 21:05.654
[gasping]

21:08.923 --> 21:09.959
Chris?

21:13.895 --> 21:15.632
[winder squeaks]

21:41.957 --> 21:43.059
[gasping]

21:43.859 --> 21:45.395
Hey, sorry, guys.

21:49.297 --> 21:50.299
Are you okay?

21:55.837 --> 21:57.204
Yeah.

21:57.206 --> 21:59.209
Yeah, I'm fine.

22:00.008 --> 22:01.307
[sighs]

22:01.309 --> 22:02.344
I'm fine.

22:11.453 --> 22:13.821
You okay, honey?

22:13.823 --> 22:16.726
Yeah. I was just
imagining things.

22:18.326 --> 22:19.328
Okay.

22:19.894 --> 22:20.963
Night.

22:23.298 --> 22:24.867
Love you.

22:48.958 --> 22:50.293
[inaudible]

23:11.313 --> 23:13.346
[Father Perez]
He's a <i>curandero.</i>

23:13.348 --> 23:16.015
The ritual is called smudging.

23:16.017 --> 23:18.284
It's supposed to rid the body
of any negativity

23:18.286 --> 23:20.053
that may have
attached itself to it

23:20.055 --> 23:22.221
during times of great stress.

23:22.223 --> 23:23.990
Do you believe it works?

23:23.992 --> 23:24.793
[chuckles softly]

23:26.094 --> 23:28.861
What does it matter
what I believe?

23:28.863 --> 23:30.799
It's what they believe.

23:31.534 --> 23:33.033
And if they believe in that,

23:33.035 --> 23:36.439
then surely
they believe in this.

23:39.007 --> 23:40.509
Did you know the boys?

23:41.876 --> 23:44.980
Yeah. I was their case worker.

23:50.518 --> 23:52.285
Can I ask you
a question, Father?

23:52.287 --> 23:53.887
Yes.

23:53.889 --> 23:56.523
Do you know anything
about <i>La Llorona?</i>

23:56.525 --> 23:57.794
[gasps softly]

24:00.161 --> 24:02.966
I haven't heard that name
since I was a child.

24:05.433 --> 24:08.101
The Weeping Woman.

24:08.103 --> 24:10.105
She was known for her beauty.

24:11.907 --> 24:15.876
The most beautiful woman
in that part of Mexico.

24:15.878 --> 24:18.978
Then one day,
a rich and handsome <i>ranchero</i>

24:18.980 --> 24:20.980
rode into her village.
[chuckles]

24:20.982 --> 24:23.851
<i>She set her sights on him.</i>

24:23.853 --> 24:26.018
<i>The marriage was splendid.</i>

24:26.020 --> 24:29.389
<i>They had two beautiful
children whom they treasured.</i>

24:29.391 --> 24:33.427
But then, after a time,

24:33.429 --> 24:36.533
she discovered him in the arms
of a younger woman.

24:38.566 --> 24:40.434
What'd she do?

24:40.436 --> 24:43.540
She took from him
what was most priceless.

24:45.274 --> 24:47.043
She murdered their children.

24:49.245 --> 24:53.346
In a fit of jealous rage,
she drowned them in the river.

24:53.348 --> 24:55.983
<i>After she realized
what she had done,</i>

24:55.985 --> 24:58.651
- <i>she was consumed by guilt.</i>
- [sobbing]

24:58.653 --> 25:01.420
She threw herself
into those same waters.

25:01.422 --> 25:04.056
Then is cursed
to roam the earth,

25:04.058 --> 25:06.595
searching for children
to take their place.

25:08.197 --> 25:10.300
Children are told to behave,

25:11.366 --> 25:14.034
listen to their elders,

25:14.036 --> 25:17.974
or <i>La Llorona</i> will come
and steal them away.

25:20.174 --> 25:21.877
So it's a folktale?

25:25.447 --> 25:26.916
To some.

25:31.386 --> 25:32.554
Here.

25:33.956 --> 25:37.024
It has seen me through
many dark nights.

25:37.026 --> 25:38.492
May it do the same for you.

25:38.494 --> 25:43.199
Oh, thank you but my husband
was the religious one, not me.

25:44.365 --> 25:46.368
You don't
have to be religious

25:47.135 --> 25:48.971
to have faith.

25:52.674 --> 25:54.476
[thunder rumbles]

26:03.986 --> 26:05.988
[thunder rumbling]

26:08.157 --> 26:10.526
[sobbing in distance]

26:25.207 --> 26:27.209

26:33.748 --> 26:35.584

28:02.504 --> 28:03.740

- [sizzles]

28:04.706 --> 28:06.209
[gasping]

28:20.189 --> 28:21.423
Chris?

28:24.159 --> 28:25.395
Chris!

28:29.198 --> 28:30.233
Sam?

28:32.133 --> 28:33.135
Sam?

28:34.870 --> 28:36.671
[footsteps running]

28:40.609 --> 28:41.711
Sam?

28:45.180 --> 28:47.182
[Samantha whimpering]

28:58.727 --> 29:00.095
Sam?

29:20.582 --> 29:21.584
Sam?

29:22.784 --> 29:24.487
What's going on, honey?

29:25.453 --> 29:27.089
Honey, what happened
to your arm?

29:28.390 --> 29:29.725
I fell.

29:31.392 --> 29:32.862
That's quite a fall.

29:35.463 --> 29:36.465
Hey.

29:37.499 --> 29:41.234
I know things are a little bit
hard right now.

29:41.236 --> 29:43.706
And I know that the world
sometimes seems scary.

29:45.873 --> 29:47.707
But I was thinking,

29:47.709 --> 29:50.744
remember what
Daddy used to say?

29:50.746 --> 29:53.583
About if you were scared
and he wasn't there?

29:54.716 --> 29:56.649
He'd tell you
to hold onto to Misty

29:56.651 --> 29:58.621
and you squeeze her
really tight.

29:59.688 --> 30:01.755
Does it feel any better?

30:01.757 --> 30:03.758
That feels
a little bit better, right?

30:08.197 --> 30:09.398
What are you looking at?

30:12.500 --> 30:13.667
[knock on door]

30:13.669 --> 30:15.204
Coop's here.

30:24.313 --> 30:25.648
Come on.

30:28.316 --> 30:29.651
Come on, sweetie.

30:34.989 --> 30:36.858
[thunder rumbling]

30:46.235 --> 30:47.737
Rough day, guys?

30:50.305 --> 30:51.673
Can we go watch TV?

30:53.275 --> 30:54.410
Sure.

30:59.648 --> 31:00.950
[sighs heavily]

31:04.253 --> 31:06.189
[TV playing]

31:06.520 --> 31:07.653
Um...

31:07.655 --> 31:08.823
Cheers?

31:11.293 --> 31:12.792
It's been that kinda day, huh?

31:12.794 --> 31:14.761
- Week.
- Month?

31:14.763 --> 31:17.697
- Year.
- [chuckles]

31:17.699 --> 31:19.466
I don't know.
They're hanging in.

31:19.468 --> 31:21.737
I think we need...

31:23.337 --> 31:24.603
Time.

31:24.605 --> 31:25.807
Yeah.

31:26.674 --> 31:27.976
And the occasional takeout,

31:28.844 --> 31:30.276
so thank you.

31:30.278 --> 31:32.445
You're welcome.

31:32.447 --> 31:33.513
Well, if you're not
in the mood

31:33.515 --> 31:34.581
to talk personal problems,

31:34.583 --> 31:36.518
how about professional ones?

31:36.951 --> 31:38.517
Oh, no. What?

31:38.519 --> 31:40.690
It's about Patricia Alvarez.

31:42.958 --> 31:43.990
We know that she had
some involvement

31:43.992 --> 31:46.793
in her sons' deaths,
but she has a solid alibi.

31:46.795 --> 31:48.328
Several parishioners
at her church say

31:48.330 --> 31:50.063
they saw her at the time
that her kids were taken.

31:50.065 --> 31:51.163
Really?

31:51.165 --> 31:54.668
You know her story.
Just take a look at the file.

31:54.670 --> 31:56.471
Maybe you'll see
something I missed.

31:57.939 --> 31:59.572
I would love to help you

31:59.574 --> 32:02.508
but she does not
want to see me.

32:02.510 --> 32:04.476
Well, that's just it.

32:04.478 --> 32:05.480
She's angry at you.

32:06.948 --> 32:07.813
And one of the first things

32:07.815 --> 32:09.448
your husband
ever taught me is that...

32:09.450 --> 32:11.386
Angry people love to talk.

33:25.494 --> 33:26.796
[sighs]

33:58.759 --> 33:59.929

37:06.681 --> 37:07.850

37:11.018 --> 37:12.787
What are you doing?

37:15.122 --> 37:16.124
Chris.

37:17.658 --> 37:18.861
Hey.

37:19.660 --> 37:20.895
You okay, honey?

37:22.330 --> 37:23.332
Chris?

37:24.064 --> 37:25.833
Honey?

37:26.835 --> 37:28.070
You all right?

Honey. Hey.

Come on.

37:57.098 --> 37:58.431
Hey, wake up.

37:58.433 --> 37:59.931
What happened?

37:59.933 --> 38:01.234
You were sleepwalking, baby.

38:01.236 --> 38:02.902
Oh, sweetie.

38:02.904 --> 38:05.038
You were just sleepwalking.

38:05.040 --> 38:06.406
It's okay.

38:06.408 --> 38:07.873
Come on. Come on, baby.

38:07.875 --> 38:09.178
Let's get you upstairs.
Let's go to sleep.

38:10.011 --> 38:11.411
Come on.

You're okay.

[rustling]

[switch clicks]

39:02.830 --> 39:04.767
Is there someone in here?

39:14.274 --> 39:15.908
Because my husband is a cop

39:15.910 --> 39:18.413
and he's gonna be home
any minute now.

Nothing. Nothing.

I'm sorry.
Come on in, honey.

get your foot off of me.

What?

41:20.100 --> 41:21.803
[door buzzes]

41:36.651 --> 41:38.520
Patricia?

41:43.091 --> 41:46.862
I'm very sorry
about your loss.

41:48.930 --> 41:51.933
I can't even imagine
how you must feel.

How I feel?

41:57.571 --> 41:59.006
[scoffs]

42:00.408 --> 42:02.310
I feel nothing.

42:03.243 --> 42:05.413
Because I have felt the worst.

42:07.348 --> 42:09.147
I am done.

42:09.149 --> 42:11.252
I don't care
what they do to me.

42:13.553 --> 42:15.623
You should be sitting here
instead of me.

42:16.491 --> 42:19.458
You killed my boys, not me.

42:19.460 --> 42:21.960
[speaks Spanish]

42:21.962 --> 42:23.596
Patricia,
you had them locked up.

42:23.598 --> 42:25.163
I had them hidden.

42:25.165 --> 42:26.368
[speaks Spanish]

42:27.634 --> 42:29.567
[in English]
And now she has them!

42:29.569 --> 42:31.172
She has them!

42:33.140 --> 42:34.375
[whispers] <i>Mis hijos.</i>

42:40.247 --> 42:42.714
What happened to your arm?

42:42.716 --> 42:44.585
What happened to you,
Patricia?

42:48.589 --> 42:50.392
<i>La Llorona.</i>

42:52.393 --> 42:54.029
Your children,

42:55.562 --> 42:57.131
have they heard her crying?

42:58.533 --> 43:01.670
Have they felt
the sting of her tears?

43:03.538 --> 43:05.607
They will. Soon.

43:06.707 --> 43:09.141
And she will come for them.

43:09.143 --> 43:10.145
You know why?

43:12.379 --> 43:14.348
Because I told her to.

43:14.982 --> 43:16.449
No, Patricia...

43:16.451 --> 43:19.217
You know, when my boys died,

43:19.219 --> 43:22.754
I didn't pray to God
for their salvation.

43:22.756 --> 43:26.294
Instead, I prayed to her.

43:26.761 --> 43:28.127
[chuckles]

43:28.129 --> 43:30.228
I prayed,

43:30.230 --> 43:32.665
and I prayed,
and I prayed to her

43:32.667 --> 43:34.266
to give my children
back to me

43:34.268 --> 43:36.238
and take yours instead.

43:54.721 --> 43:56.257
[inhales sharply]

- [doctor] Ah.
- [Chris exhales]

46:20.567 --> 46:23.104

46:52.299 --> 46:53.868
[knocking on door]

47:05.312 --> 47:06.814
[Anna] Cooper, hi.

47:09.783 --> 47:11.283
What?

47:11.285 --> 47:12.717
The hospital called?

47:12.719 --> 47:13.886
Yeah.

47:13.888 --> 47:15.556
Welfare check.

47:28.301 --> 47:31.338
[Donna] <i>Samantha,
how did you get those burns?</i>

47:39.647 --> 47:41.480
How about you, Chris?

47:41.482 --> 47:43.652
I told you, I fell.

47:44.518 --> 47:46.351
Is that true?

47:46.353 --> 47:47.689
Where was your mom?

47:52.359 --> 47:54.692
Anna, you know
you can't be here.

47:54.694 --> 47:56.328
Oh, come on, Donna.
I wouldn't...

47:56.330 --> 47:57.395
They're trying to protect you.

47:57.397 --> 47:58.931
They're telling you the truth.

47:58.933 --> 48:01.533
I would never hurt my kids.

48:01.535 --> 48:03.335
She's right.

48:03.337 --> 48:04.739
You can't be here.

48:16.750 --> 48:18.219
[Donna sighs]

48:20.453 --> 48:24.426
You may not believe this,
but I hate having to be here.

48:30.830 --> 48:32.531
I promised your dad
I'd watch out for you guys.

48:32.533 --> 48:33.598
So if you ever need anything,

48:33.600 --> 48:35.936
just call me. Got it?

48:39.372 --> 48:42.007
We had to release
Patricia Alvarez.

48:42.009 --> 48:43.445
Didn't have enough
to charge her.

48:46.346 --> 48:48.249
Maybe she didn't do it.

48:49.317 --> 48:50.452
What do you mean?

48:55.056 --> 48:57.459
I don't know. Never mind.

48:58.359 --> 48:59.725
Anna,

48:59.727 --> 49:01.462
whatever's going on here,

49:01.995 --> 49:03.430
fix it.

49:13.741 --> 49:17.810
<i>Dad, for the first time
in my life, I'm in love.</i>

49:17.812 --> 49:18.976
<i>That's very serious.</i>

49:18.978 --> 49:20.112
[Anna] Hey.

49:20.114 --> 49:21.349
<i>And she loves me, Dad.</i>

49:25.986 --> 49:27.355
Chris...

49:30.056 --> 49:31.593
Can we talk?

49:35.895 --> 49:37.832
Honey, I need to know
what really happened.

49:44.904 --> 49:46.473
[water splashing]

50:11.899 --> 50:13.498
[Chris] <i>I saw a woman.</i>

50:13.500 --> 50:14.703
In the house?

50:17.571 --> 50:18.906
In Samantha's room.

50:20.174 --> 50:22.911
I thought it was Sam but...

50:25.946 --> 50:28.083
A woman in a white dress.

50:29.417 --> 50:30.685
She was crying.

50:31.585 --> 50:33.455
She wants us.

50:35.689 --> 50:37.558
She wants us to be hers.

50:41.529 --> 50:43.531
Ow. Mom, that hurts.

50:46.901 --> 50:48.103
Rinsing.

50:54.507 --> 50:55.944
You believe me?

50:57.944 --> 50:59.046
Yes.

50:59.647 --> 51:00.882
I do.

51:05.152 --> 51:06.888
[grunting]

51:07.687 --> 51:08.956
[gasping heavily]

51:27.140 --> 51:28.609
[muffled screaming]

51:31.044 --> 51:32.813
[faint thudding]

51:36.517 --> 51:37.652
Sam?

51:43.056 --> 51:44.058
Sam?

51:49.529 --> 51:51.865
Sam! Sam!

51:52.665 --> 51:54.067
Sam! Open the door! Sam!

51:55.102 --> 51:56.103
Sam!

51:56.837 --> 51:58.039
[grunts]

52:01.007 --> 52:02.743
[Samantha coughing]

52:03.611 --> 52:05.145
[gasping deeply]

52:09.817 --> 52:12.120
What happened?
What happened to you?

52:12.719 --> 52:13.851
Honey.

52:13.853 --> 52:15.622
You okay?
What happened?

52:18.158 --> 52:19.160
Sam?

52:22.897 --> 52:24.165
[whimpering]

52:26.232 --> 52:27.533
Sam?

52:27.535 --> 52:28.569
[Chris] Mom.

52:29.136 --> 52:30.705
[stammers] Mom. Mom!

52:31.171 --> 52:32.703
Mom!

52:32.705 --> 52:33.839
- [screeching]
- [screaming]

52:33.841 --> 52:35.109
- [sizzling]
- [screaming]

52:36.810 --> 52:38.243
[groans] Go!

52:38.245 --> 52:40.011
[Samantha continues screaming]

52:40.013 --> 52:41.915
Go! Run!

52:42.815 --> 52:43.982
Go!

52:43.984 --> 52:45.049
Run!

52:45.051 --> 52:46.754
[whimpers]

52:48.321 --> 52:50.257
- [rumbling]
- [yelling]

52:53.192 --> 52:54.495
[door rattling]

52:55.895 --> 52:57.129
Run!

52:57.131 --> 52:58.266
Go!

52:58.799 --> 52:59.801
Run!

53:01.835 --> 53:03.705
- [whimpers]
- [rumbling stops]

53:22.723 --> 53:25.058
[Anna] I know it sounds
hard to believe.

53:29.129 --> 53:30.629
[Father Perez]
A few years ago,

53:30.631 --> 53:34.766
I placed little stock
in legends, myths,

53:34.768 --> 53:36.971
things that go
bump in the night.

53:38.004 --> 53:39.172
But then

53:40.006 --> 53:41.842
there was an incident

53:43.611 --> 53:44.946
with a doll.

53:50.984 --> 53:52.317
It opened my mind

53:52.319 --> 53:54.589
to possibilities
out of the ordinary.

53:55.788 --> 53:57.057
Can you help us?

53:59.859 --> 54:01.792
The Church works with people

54:01.794 --> 54:04.629
who specialize
in situations like this.

54:04.631 --> 54:05.897
Okay.

54:05.899 --> 54:09.836
But to get to them, we'd have
to go through the archdiocese.

54:11.337 --> 54:13.638
How long does that take?

54:13.640 --> 54:17.344
At its best, several weeks
for a case to be approved.

54:22.315 --> 54:23.317
[Anna] No.

54:25.285 --> 54:27.419
There may be another way.

54:27.421 --> 54:30.792
It's unorthodox,
but he's local.

54:31.859 --> 54:34.094
However,
if you choose this route,

54:35.428 --> 54:37.362
I must obey
the laws of the Church,

54:37.364 --> 54:40.431
and remove myself
from this process.

54:40.433 --> 54:44.069
As I said,
his methods are unorthodox.

54:44.071 --> 54:46.237
And the Church, well,

54:46.239 --> 54:49.373
the Church has their ways,
and he has his.

54:49.375 --> 54:52.714
It's why he abandoned
the collar years ago.

54:53.446 --> 54:54.913
He used to be a priest.

54:54.915 --> 54:55.917
Yes.

54:58.252 --> 55:00.951
But now, he's a faith healer.

55:00.953 --> 55:02.853
A shaman who operates

55:02.855 --> 55:05.727
on the fringes
of religion and science.

55:07.995 --> 55:10.395
A <i>curandero.</i>

55:10.397 --> 55:12.400
- [music playing on radio]
- [door bells jingling]

55:19.172 --> 55:21.042
Don't touch anything, okay?

55:23.176 --> 55:24.875
<i>Hola.</i> Excuse me.

55:24.877 --> 55:26.713
- Um...
- I've seen you before.

55:28.815 --> 55:30.449
The Alvarez memorial.

55:30.451 --> 55:31.719
Yes?

55:32.453 --> 55:34.819
Yes. I was her case worker.

55:34.821 --> 55:37.321
Well, if you've come just to
gawk at my shop,

55:37.323 --> 55:40.127
I have more
important things to do.

55:41.261 --> 55:42.426
You know what,
I don't think that

55:42.428 --> 55:43.795
we're in the right spot.
I'm sorry.

55:43.797 --> 55:45.132
Come on, guys.

55:51.437 --> 55:52.439
Have you seen this before?

55:53.439 --> 55:54.505
Yes.

55:54.507 --> 55:55.743
What is it?

55:56.810 --> 55:57.942
The Church can help you.

55:57.944 --> 56:00.981
No, no, no, please. The Church
sent us here, to you.

56:01.848 --> 56:05.385
This is Church business.

56:07.386 --> 56:08.922
Please.

56:19.265 --> 56:23.335
[Rafael] These are the marks
of <i>La Llorona.</i>

56:23.337 --> 56:25.273
You have seen her then?

56:29.810 --> 56:30.942
[Anna] You ever seen her?

56:30.944 --> 56:31.946
No.

56:33.446 --> 56:34.981
Not directly.

56:35.982 --> 56:37.984
But I have seen what she does.

56:39.520 --> 56:41.486
What do we do?

56:41.488 --> 56:45.192
We are facing an evil
that has no bounds.

56:47.861 --> 56:51.429
But she's not human. Right?

56:51.431 --> 56:54.435
No. But she was,

56:56.169 --> 57:00.340
until her murderous vanity
consumed her.

57:01.308 --> 57:04.241
She's just a dark spirit.

57:04.243 --> 57:06.310
Unholy. Forsaken by God.

57:06.312 --> 57:08.279
Okay, that's it. I'm gonna
take them to a motel.

57:08.281 --> 57:09.415
Why?

57:09.417 --> 57:14.252
She's attached herself to
your family, not your house.

57:14.254 --> 57:17.225
If you move,
she will follow you.

57:19.125 --> 57:20.928
What are we supposed
to do then?

57:28.835 --> 57:31.169
I don't think
that's gonna help.

57:31.171 --> 57:34.174
No. Not just this.

57:38.245 --> 57:39.046
At the memorial,

57:41.147 --> 57:44.415
I saw you speaking
with Father Perez.

57:44.417 --> 57:46.419
He said that
you used to be a priest.

57:49.288 --> 57:51.424
My journey
began in the Church.

57:53.292 --> 57:54.461
Yes.

57:57.263 --> 57:58.999
That was a long time ago.

58:03.437 --> 58:06.274
Take me to your home.
We must begin immediately.

58:13.446 --> 58:14.712
We're done.

58:14.714 --> 58:18.016
I'm sorry, are you just gonna
rub eggs all over everything?

58:18.018 --> 58:20.221
You think it's silly,
don't you?

58:20.953 --> 58:22.355
Pretty much.

58:25.091 --> 58:26.259
Come with me.

58:28.261 --> 58:31.228
This ritual, <i>la limpia,</i>

58:31.230 --> 58:33.567
is used to detect
the presence of evil.

58:38.205 --> 58:40.004
The bloodier the content,

58:40.006 --> 58:42.108
the greater the evil.

58:46.580 --> 58:48.882
[chanting in Spanish]

59:14.341 --> 59:17.344
Oh, that's a trick.
I saw it on <i>Johnny Carson.</i>

59:20.980 --> 59:21.982
Mom.

59:33.125 --> 59:34.194
[all gasp]

59:36.228 --> 59:37.265
Ta-da.

59:38.531 --> 59:40.300
Did you see that on <i>Carson?</i>

59:41.701 --> 59:42.904
No.

59:44.504 --> 59:46.107
[praying in Spanish]

59:50.176 --> 59:51.178
<i>Amen.</i>

59:56.015 --> 59:58.984
[Rafael in English]
<i>We all need to work together.</i>

59:58.986 --> 01:00:01.522
La Llorona
<i>thrives in darkness.</i>

01:00:02.189 --> 01:00:03.524
<i>Let's prepare.</i>

01:00:17.703 --> 01:00:20.040
[muttering prayer]

01:00:25.712 --> 01:00:30.181
That cross was carved
from a tree in Mexico.

01:00:30.183 --> 01:00:32.116
It blooms with red blossoms

01:00:32.118 --> 01:00:34.719
that make it look like
it's on fire.

01:00:34.721 --> 01:00:36.357
[speaks Spanish]

01:00:39.058 --> 01:00:40.424
The fire tree.

01:00:40.426 --> 01:00:41.962
[in English] They say

01:00:42.495 --> 01:00:44.029
the fire trees wept

01:00:44.031 --> 01:00:46.730
as <i>La Llorona</i>
drowned her children.

01:00:46.732 --> 01:00:49.567
As the only witness
to her sins,

01:00:49.569 --> 01:00:52.373
they hold a special power
over her.

01:00:55.709 --> 01:00:57.178
[blowing]

01:01:10.689 --> 01:01:14.591
<i>In nomine Patris, et Filii,
et Spiritus Sancti.</i>

01:01:14.593 --> 01:01:15.662
<i>Amen.</i>

01:01:27.607 --> 01:01:29.110
What is that?

01:01:29.843 --> 01:01:32.076
[Rafael]
The tears of <i>La Llorona.</i>

01:01:32.078 --> 01:01:33.279
I've sanctified them.

01:01:33.647 --> 01:01:34.648
Why?

01:01:35.815 --> 01:01:37.417
Antivenom.

01:01:46.259 --> 01:01:48.295
[thunder rumbling]

01:02:01.674 --> 01:02:03.440
Is that another ritual?

01:02:03.442 --> 01:02:06.147
Yes. Breakfast for dinner.

01:02:07.580 --> 01:02:09.547
That was David's thing.

01:02:09.549 --> 01:02:12.350
Breakfast for dinner.
I used to always tease him

01:02:12.352 --> 01:02:13.585
it was 'cause cereal
was the only thing

01:02:13.587 --> 01:02:14.520
he knew how to make.

01:02:14.522 --> 01:02:18.589
Tonight, <i>la comida</i>
is for comfort,

01:02:18.591 --> 01:02:20.525
after everything
that you've been through,

01:02:20.527 --> 01:02:21.796
and what's to come.

01:02:22.696 --> 01:02:24.895
You don't seem very confident.

01:02:24.897 --> 01:02:27.732
I'm confident in God.

01:02:27.734 --> 01:02:30.435
Father Perez said you turned
your back on the Church.

01:02:30.437 --> 01:02:33.074
The Church? Yes.

01:02:33.772 --> 01:02:36.176
God? Never.

01:02:37.277 --> 01:02:39.313

01:02:44.518 --> 01:02:46.220
[rattling]

01:02:50.524 --> 01:02:52.359
Watch the flames.

01:02:54.160 --> 01:02:55.359
A steady flame tells us

01:02:55.361 --> 01:02:57.230
that our protective charms
are working.

01:02:58.431 --> 01:03:00.201
Is she coming?

01:03:03.803 --> 01:03:05.806
She's already here.

01:03:06.640 --> 01:03:07.708

- [thudding continues]
- [floorboard creaking]

01:03:31.864 --> 01:03:33.498
What is she doing?

01:03:33.500 --> 01:03:35.299
She's searching.

01:03:35.301 --> 01:03:36.504
For what?

01:03:37.870 --> 01:03:39.239
Us.

01:03:47.446 --> 01:03:49.482
[La Llorona screeching]

01:07:42.147 --> 01:07:44.015
You told us we'd be safe!

01:07:44.017 --> 01:07:45.917
You said
the light would protect us!

01:07:45.919 --> 01:07:47.185
Not true.

01:07:47.187 --> 01:07:48.819
Mommy, Misty's gone!
I can't find her!

01:07:48.821 --> 01:07:50.520
[Anna] Honey, not now.

01:07:50.522 --> 01:07:51.858
You let her get me.

01:07:53.625 --> 01:07:55.094
What are you talking about?

01:07:57.497 --> 01:07:58.929
You used my son as bait?

01:07:58.931 --> 01:08:01.165
No. Of course not.

01:08:01.167 --> 01:08:03.033
I used all of you as bait.

01:08:03.035 --> 01:08:04.601
Are you crazy?

01:08:04.603 --> 01:08:06.103
What if you didn't
get to him in time?

01:08:06.105 --> 01:08:07.103
But I did.

01:08:07.105 --> 01:08:09.109
And now <i>La Llorona</i>
is out of your house.

01:08:10.643 --> 01:08:11.812
What are those?

01:08:12.578 --> 01:08:13.946
Remember the fire tree?

01:08:14.747 --> 01:08:17.113
Those are its seeds.

01:08:17.116 --> 01:08:20.084
As long as this line
remains unbroken,

01:08:20.086 --> 01:08:21.651
she cannot enter.

01:08:21.653 --> 01:08:22.953
Do not touch them.

01:08:22.956 --> 01:08:24.921

whatever she can

01:08:24.924 --> 01:08:26.859

Grab a hammer and nails!

01:08:47.979 --> 01:08:49.645

01:08:49.648 --> 01:08:50.981

Don't let her in! Don't!

01:08:52.251 --> 01:08:53.850
[Rafael] Away, spirit!

01:08:53.853 --> 01:08:55.819
You have no power here!

01:13:36.368 --> 01:13:37.970
What did you do?

01:13:39.871 --> 01:13:42.539
Your pool is now filled
with holy water.

01:13:42.541 --> 01:13:45.344
<i>La Llorona</i> had no choice
but to leave.

01:13:51.349 --> 01:13:52.952
Thank you, honey.

What's wrong with her?

01:14:27.486 --> 01:14:30.119
<i>La Llorona</i> had your daughter
in her grasp.

01:14:30.121 --> 01:14:34.057
Now, when she calls to her
she will go.

01:14:34.059 --> 01:14:35.491
When we banish the spirit,

01:14:35.493 --> 01:14:36.893
her trance will be broken.

01:14:36.895 --> 01:14:39.032
Until then,
we have to keep them close.

What?
What do we do?

01:15:07.559 --> 01:15:08.926
Do we have to?

01:15:08.928 --> 01:15:10.026
[Rafael] Yes.

01:15:10.028 --> 01:15:12.098
Just until sunrise.

01:15:13.532 --> 01:15:14.968
Okay.

You are so brave.

Your daddy would be
so proud of you.

I need you to know
that it's okay to be scared.

[Rafael] Keep it close.
