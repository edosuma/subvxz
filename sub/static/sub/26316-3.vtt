WEBVTT

00:05.423 --> 00:07.967
Michael, a demon has infiltrated the group.

00:08.510 --> 00:10.220
Not just any demon.

00:10.512 --> 00:14.349
Trevor is a diabolical, sadistic
agent of evil.

00:14.682 --> 00:18.394
Might just be the single most dangerous
creature in the universe.

00:18.853 --> 00:21.731
Who wants lemon bars?

00:21.981 --> 00:24.984
It's my nana's recipe
and they are just sinful.

00:25.026 --> 00:27.946
Love 'em on my lips but hate 'em on my hips,
if you know what I mean.

00:28.029 --> 00:30.532
Alright, new guy, comin' in strong
with free dessert.

00:30.615 --> 00:33.952
You must be Eleanor, the reason
this is all happening.

00:34.077 --> 00:36.746
I am. That's so nice to hear someone say

00:36.830 --> 00:38.540
"Eleanor, you're the reason
this is all happening"

00:38.623 --> 00:40.375
who isn't a judge in small claims court.

00:40.792 --> 00:42.418
Thank you for this, Eleanor.

00:42.502 --> 00:44.754
It's a wonderful thing you've done.

00:44.921 --> 00:47.048
Mm... Happy to help you out, buddy.

00:47.924 --> 00:49.259
Oh, we're doing a long hug!

00:50.426 --> 00:52.220
- Are you crying?
- I'm sorry, I...

00:52.762 --> 00:56.099
God, I'm just so happy to be here,
if that makes sense.

00:56.224 --> 00:58.810
OK, the five of us narrowly avoided death.

00:58.977 --> 01:00.228
The operating theory

01:00.311 --> 01:02.230
of this experiment is that--

01:08.820 --> 01:12.073
So, I give them ethics problems
and we scan their brains

01:12.157 --> 01:14.284
and we get a sense
of their baseline moral instincts.

01:14.409 --> 01:15.827
Right. Then I'll show them pictures

01:15.910 --> 01:17.954
that trigger memories
of their near-death experiences.

01:18.037 --> 01:20.790
We'll scan again,
and see if we get a different result.

01:21.207 --> 01:24.794
For example, I'll show Jason
pictures of: a safe...

01:25.253 --> 01:27.463
a snorkel, and whip-it canisters.

01:27.630 --> 01:31.342
Got it. Also, what a grim death
that would've been.

01:31.634 --> 01:34.053
Darling, do you remember all the rules
about what can

01:34.137 --> 01:36.139
and cannot be worn inside an MRI?

01:36.347 --> 01:40.226
More specifically,
what if one's brassiere is very thin

01:40.602 --> 01:43.229
but also very pure... gold.

01:43.479 --> 01:46.733
I dunno but I'm in a similar "situ-aysh"

01:46.816 --> 01:49.777
because the sports bra I'm wearing
is kind of rust-coloured

01:49.861 --> 01:53.281
underneath the armpits, so I guess
we'll roll the dice together.

01:53.781 --> 01:56.367
Hey, Eleanor, do I have
the right phone number for you?

01:56.451 --> 01:59.537
You haven't responded
to any of the dank memes I've sent!

01:59.621 --> 02:01.039
Oh, yeah, I...

02:01.122 --> 02:03.625
cos I was laughing too hard to reply.

02:03.750 --> 02:06.669
OK, what's your "fave?"
Cos mine's "Damn, Daniel!"

02:06.836 --> 02:08.963
"Back at it again with the white Vans!"

02:09.672 --> 02:11.966
- Should we get started maybe?
- Oh, Mrs Teacher...

02:12.050 --> 02:13.968
for my turn,
is there any way to get like...

02:14.802 --> 02:18.890
- extra radiation?
- There is no radiation in an MRI.

02:18.973 --> 02:21.059
- But why do you ask?
- Uh, no reason.

02:21.142 --> 02:23.811
Jason, what have you got
in your hand there, bud?

02:23.895 --> 02:25.688
- Nothing.
- Is it a spider?

02:26.898 --> 02:28.733
- Yes.
- Do you think taking a spider

02:28.816 --> 02:31.236
in an MRI machine
will give you super powers?

02:31.319 --> 02:33.655
Hey, it might work. He already bit me
a bunch of times

02:33.696 --> 02:36.032
and gave me the power to swell up my hand!

02:36.115 --> 02:38.076
- Oh, my God!
- What?

02:40.995 --> 02:44.582
- Trevor.
- Hey, Mikey, fancy seeing you down on Earth

02:44.666 --> 02:46.501
completely illegally.

02:46.751 --> 02:48.002
Sweet outfit.

02:48.086 --> 02:52.048
Dick Tracy called, he said you're a butt-face
and he's been ploughing your mum.

02:52.090 --> 02:54.300
Yeah, well,
Dick Tracy called me too, first.

02:54.634 --> 02:57.887
And he said he was about to call you
and say a lie about me

02:57.971 --> 03:00.848
that was actually true about you, instead.

03:01.808 --> 03:02.684
Whatever.

03:03.059 --> 03:04.852
What are you doing here, Trevor?

03:04.936 --> 03:07.522
Shawn hacked the Judge's system,
and we caught you cheating

03:07.605 --> 03:09.857
getting your four little cockroaches
to meet up.

03:09.941 --> 03:13.611
What? You think we were just gonna sit
around in the Bad Place blowin' beefers

03:13.695 --> 03:16.322
while you're down on Earth
boning us in the meat-hole?

03:16.489 --> 03:19.284
So, why didn't Shawn just go
to the Judge and turn me in?

03:19.409 --> 03:21.995
Because this way's more fun, knuckle-nuts!

03:22.078 --> 03:23.371
First of all...

03:23.496 --> 03:26.916
I'm currently formulating a better comeback
to your Dick Tracy burn

03:27.083 --> 03:28.793
and it's gonna devastate you.

03:28.835 --> 03:30.461
Second, you're too late...

03:30.545 --> 03:33.131
because when I did this experiment
in my Neighbourhood

03:33.214 --> 03:37.593
every time Eleanor asked Chidi for help,
their bond became unbreakable

03:37.635 --> 03:39.887
and the entire group improved.

03:39.971 --> 03:41.389
No, you're right.

03:41.472 --> 03:45.977
There's no way I'll get one of these bozos
to drop out of an unpaid

03:46.060 --> 03:49.605
rigorous academic, study, especially
when they're doing it with me...

03:49.689 --> 03:51.816
their overeager new best friend.

03:51.899 --> 03:54.152
Well, I should head back.
You want to come with?

03:54.235 --> 03:56.988
Oh, right, they've all seen you already

03:57.030 --> 03:59.615
so you can't show your
face to them again...

03:59.699 --> 04:02.368
so you're powerless to stop me.

04:02.660 --> 04:04.370
Later days, dingus.

04:05.038 --> 04:08.416
Dick Tracy called back, on his watch phone

04:08.499 --> 04:10.501
and said you better watch out!

04:11.085 --> 04:13.087
Shoot. A second too late.

04:13.755 --> 04:18.676
OK, uh, Simone's gotta analyse the scans,
so why don't the rest of you head home?

04:18.885 --> 04:21.304
- Good first day, everyone.
- Hey, Teach. Um...

04:22.513 --> 04:23.806
do you think maybe...

04:24.432 --> 04:27.643
we could continue the one-on-one lessons
on the side?

04:27.810 --> 04:30.521
I feel like, last week, I had my own
personal ninja master

04:30.688 --> 04:35.276
and now I'm taking tai chi
with bunch of farting housewives.

04:36.277 --> 04:39.447
Between the new project and my classes,
I won't have time.

04:39.530 --> 04:42.700
But this is way better!
You're still gonna learn a lot

04:42.784 --> 04:45.703
and you'll have a fun group of people
to study with outside of class!

04:46.037 --> 04:47.705
- But...
- Hey, gang!

04:47.747 --> 04:49.540
I just had a neat idea.

04:49.874 --> 04:51.084
Let's all go sight seeing.

04:51.167 --> 04:53.628
- Dope!
- Yeah, we can check out Sydney

04:53.711 --> 04:55.922
get to know each other, bond.

04:55.963 --> 04:58.883
What do you say, E-Street Band,
you up for a Segway tour of...

04:58.966 --> 05:00.802
Australia, mate?

05:01.094 --> 05:04.347
This is a knife, on the barbie.

05:04.389 --> 05:06.057
Cool idea.

05:06.140 --> 05:08.601
I'm just worried that maybe
it's too cool.

05:08.810 --> 05:12.730
I think I'm just gonna find the nearest bar,
have one or eight drinks and hit the hay.

05:12.772 --> 05:14.190
Even better, we'll all go

05:14.273 --> 05:16.109
"bend an elbow".

05:16.192 --> 05:19.779
Actually, I know the perfect place
for homesick Americans!

05:22.532 --> 05:23.741
Hi, dudes!

05:23.825 --> 05:26.285
Welcome to the Cowboy
Skyscraper Buffet!

05:26.369 --> 05:30.790
Oh, hey, can we get the Florida table?
They absolutely nail the swamp stench!

05:31.165 --> 05:33.000
Aw, someone's seated there.

05:33.084 --> 05:36.671
But if you purchase our "Manifest Destiny"
package for 30 dollars

05:36.754 --> 05:39.424
you can have anyone you want
forcibly removed from the table.

05:39.465 --> 05:40.925
We'll just sit anywhere.

05:40.967 --> 05:43.761
When your table's ready,
this gun will go off!

05:45.721 --> 05:47.682
I think... this is real.

05:51.727 --> 05:53.062
So listen up, y'all.

05:53.104 --> 05:55.440
I was so excited to join the group

05:55.523 --> 05:58.901
that I made sweatshirts!

05:59.235 --> 06:00.445
You get a sweatshirt.

06:00.945 --> 06:02.280
You get a sweatshirt.

06:02.321 --> 06:03.781
- You get a sweatshirt.
- I get a sweatshirt.

06:03.865 --> 06:05.032
The Brain-y Bunch.

06:05.116 --> 06:07.201
Awesome! I love being on teams!

06:07.285 --> 06:09.328
And if we're on a
team now, we need nicknames!

06:09.412 --> 06:13.166
Optimus, Bumblebee, Jazz, uh...
Megatron.

06:13.249 --> 06:16.169
That's what you can each call me.
Now we need nicknames for you guys.

06:16.294 --> 06:18.129
Ah, this is the best!

06:18.212 --> 06:21.257
I'm gonna get the first round
and we are all gonna toast to Eleanor

06:21.591 --> 06:24.802
The reason we're all here! Yay, Eleanor!

06:25.386 --> 06:28.473
Oh, well if you guys are celebrating,
I recommend the jalapeÃ±o poppers.

06:28.514 --> 06:30.391
Hi there, I'm Janet.

06:30.475 --> 06:31.809
I'll be taking care of you tonight.

06:34.854 --> 06:36.564
Can I get you started with some drinks?

06:36.647 --> 06:39.859
Our specialty cocktail tonight
is "The Fourth of July".

06:39.901 --> 06:43.613
It's half an apple pie, blended
with Southern Comfort and Coca Cola

06:43.654 --> 06:45.448
served in a Chevy hubcap.

06:45.490 --> 06:47.950
Why don't you just go get us
a round of beers?

06:47.992 --> 06:49.327
Of course. Here you go...

06:50.870 --> 06:53.623
Sorry... I... will...

06:53.706 --> 06:56.000
go... physically... pick those up...

06:56.626 --> 07:01.005
I guess, and... then walk them
back here with my feet.

07:01.589 --> 07:03.591
But just so you know,
I will be here all night.

07:03.966 --> 07:05.968
Watching everything...

07:06.344 --> 07:08.930
that... you... order.

07:10.973 --> 07:14.977
So, Ellie Baby. Brainstorm.
We should get a house!

07:15.019 --> 07:19.732
Me, you, Tahani, Jason,
we should all go in together on a place!

07:19.815 --> 07:21.734
- Roomies!
- Roomies!

07:21.984 --> 07:23.194
That is...

07:24.403 --> 07:25.571
technically an idea.

07:25.655 --> 07:28.074
I think it would be "supes" fun.
We could play pranks

07:28.115 --> 07:29.450
- on each other for my vlog.
- No.

07:29.534 --> 07:31.410
We could do one of those
ice bucket challenges

07:31.494 --> 07:32.620
- that I sent you.
- I don't think so.

07:32.745 --> 07:34.372
- Not!
- Or maybe just a Harlem Shake?

07:34.413 --> 07:35.915
I like to cook.

07:35.998 --> 07:37.708
- And I have been dying to experiment
- Please stop.

07:37.792 --> 07:39.377
- ...with Jamaican food, man.
- Please stop now!

07:39.418 --> 07:40.711
I like-a Jamaican food.

07:40.836 --> 07:43.297
Listen to the reggae and smoke da joint.

07:43.381 --> 07:45.007
That's a Jamaican accent.

07:47.468 --> 07:50.096
Come on, come on, come on,
come on, come on, come on!

07:50.137 --> 07:51.097
Hey, how's it going?

07:51.180 --> 07:54.892
Not good, Michael. I don't have my powers.
I can't summon things.

07:54.976 --> 07:56.727
Dictionary. Spaghetti.

07:57.353 --> 07:59.063
Jet-ski. Giraffe. Gah!

07:59.146 --> 08:00.648
Look what I've been reduced to!

08:00.690 --> 08:02.066
Humans only live 80 years

08:02.149 --> 08:05.278
and they spend so much of it
just waiting for things to be over.

08:05.361 --> 08:07.071
I'm all out of sorts down here, too.

08:07.113 --> 08:10.074
I'm bad at lying now.
That used to be my thing!

08:10.116 --> 08:13.327
And every part of my body is either
too dry or too wet.

08:13.411 --> 08:14.787
It's worse for me, man!

08:14.829 --> 08:19.000
Ever since we walked through that portal,
my knowledge has stopped updating.

08:19.292 --> 08:20.876
The instant before we left

08:20.960 --> 08:23.713
a man in Caracas, Venezuela
named Raul Benitez

08:23.796 --> 08:25.715
was eating a ham sandwich.

08:25.798 --> 08:29.176
Did he finish it? I don't know
and it's making me crazy!

08:29.260 --> 08:30.636
- I gotta find him.
- Janet!

08:31.012 --> 08:32.805
Focus on the mission!

08:32.888 --> 08:35.391
We have to get Trevor away from the humans.

08:37.059 --> 08:40.730
I am so glad you came out with us, man!

08:40.896 --> 08:43.524
I just assumed you would think it's
unprofessional to be friends

08:43.608 --> 08:44.900
with the subjects of your study.

08:44.942 --> 08:46.485
No, I never thought that.

08:48.112 --> 08:49.739
I mean, I... I kind of do now.

08:49.989 --> 08:51.532
Should I not be socialising?

08:51.657 --> 08:54.368
I'm sure it's fine. I mean,
how much harm could it possibly do.

08:54.702 --> 08:55.703
Good point.

08:57.121 --> 09:00.416
Such a good point, that I'm gonna go think
about how good a point that is

09:00.499 --> 09:02.793
over there, by myself,
for several minutes. Excuse me.

09:04.837 --> 09:06.005
Hey, "El-Train"...

09:06.047 --> 09:09.634
you think with all these new <i>Star Wars</i> movies
they'll finally make a new <i>Spaceballs?</i>

09:09.717 --> 09:12.303
I'm sorry, I'm getting a text,
and I have to take this.

09:12.637 --> 09:14.472
OK, everybody...

09:14.513 --> 09:16.891
here are your beers

09:16.974 --> 09:20.269
and here is yours. Oh no!

09:20.311 --> 09:21.354
Oh...

09:21.437 --> 09:24.565
I guess you should go to the bathroom,
or maybe go home and never come back.

09:24.607 --> 09:26.484
No worries. I made extra sweatshirts!

09:26.525 --> 09:28.986
Besides, we're having
too much fun to leave.

09:29.028 --> 09:32.865
Hey, speaking of fun, I know this super-fun
drinking game we can play.

09:32.948 --> 09:37.370
Every time one of you says something
that the other can't relate to

09:37.453 --> 09:38.579
you both drink.

09:38.663 --> 09:42.124
Could be fun. I once played a drinking game
with Ryan Reynolds and Blake Lively

09:42.208 --> 09:43.626
at their macrobiotic farm

09:43.751 --> 09:47.922
with a particularly robust batch
of homemade kombucha.

09:48.005 --> 09:50.549
Do I have to drink for every word
I don't know?

09:50.633 --> 09:52.551
Up to you. Just drink.

09:52.885 --> 09:55.096
Ooh, hey, what happened with Chidi

09:55.137 --> 09:56.263
and where's Eleanor?

09:56.347 --> 09:58.474
This... this...
this is all moving too fast!

09:58.516 --> 10:00.142
Can we just take Trevor out?

10:00.226 --> 10:02.770
I don't know if he can die, but I
could drop a steamroller on his head.

10:03.020 --> 10:05.189
Oh, darn it! I can't summon things!

10:05.231 --> 10:07.983
I guess I could kick him with my soft feet?

10:08.067 --> 10:10.444
- Earth sucks!
- You stay on Trevor.

10:10.569 --> 10:12.321
Keep interfering with his plan, alright?

10:12.405 --> 10:16.033
I'm gonna do my librarian act
and nudge Chidi back to the table.

10:17.868 --> 10:20.287
Oh! Yummy!

10:20.371 --> 10:22.998
You gotta relax, man, you're off the clock.

10:23.082 --> 10:24.834
It's just a simple drink with friends

10:24.875 --> 10:26.419
at the world's worst restaurant.

10:26.502 --> 10:28.087
No, but Trevor's right.

10:28.170 --> 10:31.257
I might skew the study
by fraternising with the subjects.

10:31.340 --> 10:32.425
We can be colleagues.

10:32.466 --> 10:34.427
"Associates" is pushing it.

10:34.510 --> 10:38.305
And by even having this conversation,
you're becoming my confidant!

10:38.347 --> 10:39.974
I can't have that.

10:40.057 --> 10:44.729
Geez, I kinda thought that before everyone
else showed up, you and I were...

10:45.479 --> 10:47.273
like becoming actual friends.

10:48.065 --> 10:50.401
Oh no, you're right! What have I done?

10:50.443 --> 10:54.363
OK, OK. I... I'm gonna go...
to the bar and get you a hot tea.

10:54.447 --> 10:56.532
- OK.
- Or a regular-temperature Xanax.

10:56.615 --> 10:58.701
- Mm.
- Try not to fall apart.

11:00.870 --> 11:02.079
Professor Anagonye!

11:02.496 --> 11:04.457
Oh, yeah, I thought I recognised you.

11:04.498 --> 11:06.876
It's me, the librarian, from the library.

11:07.334 --> 11:09.003
Oh, right. Hi!

11:09.086 --> 11:12.465
Sorry, uh... I was just kind of
in the middle of something here.

11:12.506 --> 11:14.008
Well, maybe I can help.

11:14.383 --> 11:16.719
You know what I like to do
in situations like these?

11:17.470 --> 11:19.805
I haven't told you anything
about what I'm going through.

11:20.890 --> 11:22.141
Do that first.

11:22.224 --> 11:24.477
Then I'll tell you
what I'd do in situations

11:24.560 --> 11:26.353
such as the one you're about to describe.

11:26.437 --> 11:27.938
I've been in every situation.

11:28.272 --> 11:29.523
Cos I'm a librarian.

11:30.065 --> 11:31.066
Hit me, go ahead.

11:31.650 --> 11:33.986
- Mm...
- Ah-la-la-la.

11:34.153 --> 11:35.696
I'm tired.

11:36.155 --> 11:37.656
Does anybody want a gallon of water

11:37.740 --> 11:39.366
- to sober up?
- No thanks, sweetheart.

11:39.450 --> 11:41.452
I just called a car for
these two lovebirds.

11:41.535 --> 11:43.537
So why don't you just bring us the cheque?

11:43.579 --> 11:46.207
Oh, and you should smile more...

11:46.248 --> 11:47.666
you'll get bigger tips.

11:49.001 --> 11:51.420
- Gosh, you're pretty.
- No.

11:51.545 --> 11:52.505
You're pretty.

11:53.130 --> 11:54.590
Pretty beautiful.

11:56.008 --> 11:57.176
If you ask me, Chidi...

11:57.218 --> 12:00.721
you need to get back over there, you know,
spend time with the team.

12:00.763 --> 12:03.432
Though we do have a saying
in the library game.

12:03.516 --> 12:06.519
Uh... "There's only room
for one male subject

12:06.602 --> 12:07.937
in an academic study.

12:08.103 --> 12:10.689
So keep the one who got there first...

12:11.732 --> 12:13.734
- Catchy.
- Gotta go now.

12:13.818 --> 12:16.195
Closest thing I could find to herbal tea
was a root beer

12:16.278 --> 12:17.988
I had them throw in the microwave.

12:18.405 --> 12:19.865
Dou know what? Don't drink that!

12:20.407 --> 12:21.659
I think I'm just gonna head home.

12:21.700 --> 12:23.494
But you can go and spend time
with the others.

12:23.536 --> 12:26.413
Yeah, man, that's not really
what I signed up for.

12:26.497 --> 12:27.832
I mean, Tahani is... meh.

12:27.915 --> 12:29.500
But Jason, woof!

12:29.583 --> 12:31.085
And Trevor... urgh!

12:31.168 --> 12:34.213
They're not the reason I flew
all the way from Arizona.

12:35.130 --> 12:36.966
- You are.
- I'm sorry.

12:37.049 --> 12:38.676
Uh... but this is just...

12:39.552 --> 12:40.511
how it has to be.

12:41.220 --> 12:42.847
I'll, uh... I'll see you tomorrow.

12:44.682 --> 12:46.684
Hey, E-dog, get over here.

12:46.767 --> 12:48.227
It's trivia night.

12:48.269 --> 12:50.688
First round questions are
all about Logan Paul

12:50.813 --> 12:52.815
and you know I'm Lo-gang for life.

12:53.315 --> 12:54.900
Go put your head up your own butt.

12:54.984 --> 12:56.026
- What?
- What?

12:56.068 --> 12:56.861
What?

13:01.031 --> 13:03.993
Oh, don't you butt-necks ever give up?

13:04.368 --> 13:07.580
No, and what are you even doing in a
bathroom? You're a demon, you don't...

13:08.455 --> 13:10.374
- need it.
- I like the smells.

13:10.457 --> 13:12.293
And I like putting my hands in the toilet

13:12.376 --> 13:14.670
so everything I touch gets a little bit
of poop on it.

13:14.962 --> 13:16.797
Hey, you guys see what I did out there?

13:16.839 --> 13:21.135
I am so good, I got Eleanor
to leave a bar... early!

13:21.218 --> 13:24.346
Chidi's melting down,
Jason and Tahani just left together.

13:24.430 --> 13:26.974
If they hook up, she's on the first
private jet out of here.

13:27.016 --> 13:28.434
This was too easy!

13:28.642 --> 13:31.061
Gonna take a lot more than that
to break up this group.

13:31.520 --> 13:33.355
Why don't you give up, Trevor?

13:33.439 --> 13:36.317
As long as we're here,
you'll never succeed.

13:36.400 --> 13:38.152
Maybe, but how long will that take?

13:38.235 --> 13:40.195
I mean, at some point
the Judge will find out

13:40.279 --> 13:42.239
that you're not in your little room
watching ticker tape.

13:42.740 --> 13:44.241
Right? Tick, tick, tick, tick.

13:44.909 --> 13:46.869
But hey, may the worst demon win.

13:47.411 --> 13:48.370
Good luck, Mikey.

13:50.205 --> 13:51.749
- Ha, poop hands!
- Oh!

13:51.832 --> 13:53.667
I can't believe you fell for that!

13:57.922 --> 14:00.174
Are you alright?
You didn't sleep at all last night.

14:00.257 --> 14:02.468
Yeah, I got a solid eight minutes.

14:02.551 --> 14:04.887
Not consecutively, but still. It's fine!

14:05.387 --> 14:06.764
You're not even that blurry.

14:06.805 --> 14:08.140
You gotta take it easy, man.

14:08.182 --> 14:10.434
I mean, you're not sleeping.
Your eye is twitching.

14:10.517 --> 14:12.937
This study has to be airtight.

14:12.978 --> 14:16.065
And this ethical question of friendship

14:16.106 --> 14:18.067
with the subjects is weighing on me.

14:18.150 --> 14:19.443
I've done a million of these things.

14:19.526 --> 14:21.779
I promise I'll warn you
if you cross any lines.

14:21.862 --> 14:24.990
I don't want to come anywhere near
those lines!

14:25.240 --> 14:29.161
I have been waiting my entire career
for the right thesis

14:29.244 --> 14:30.996
and I am not going to blow it.

14:31.872 --> 14:33.332
I have to keep this professional.

14:33.374 --> 14:35.042
Fine. But you need to get some rest.

14:35.084 --> 14:37.503
This morning you bit into a raw egg
like it was an apple.

14:37.544 --> 14:39.588
I thought it was hard boiled.

14:39.922 --> 14:41.423
Yeah, but still the shell.

14:42.716 --> 14:44.843
This is the best secret friend
handshake, bro.

14:44.885 --> 14:46.053
And it goes...

14:46.178 --> 14:48.597
Attention everyone, do not look at me!

14:48.889 --> 14:51.058
Oh, I don't... don't know what to do.

14:51.100 --> 14:54.436
I am both over hung and humiliated

14:54.478 --> 14:56.855
by my uncouth comportment last night.

14:56.897 --> 14:59.483
Please accept
these formal letters of apology.

14:59.942 --> 15:01.777
Further apologies for their appearance.

15:01.860 --> 15:04.613
I just couldn't find a proper calligrapher
at five in the morning.

15:04.655 --> 15:07.408
So what happened to you two love birds
last night, huh?

15:07.491 --> 15:09.827
- Frankly, it is none of your business.
- Uh, sorry.

15:09.952 --> 15:12.788
Jason was a perfect gentleman last night.

15:13.247 --> 15:16.000
Thank you so much for
getting me home safely.

15:16.041 --> 15:20.295
I wouldn't blame you, should you
ostracise me for my boorish behaviour.

15:20.337 --> 15:22.047
You weren't boring, you were fun.

15:22.548 --> 15:26.010
Crazy story. After you got into the cab,
I forgot where I lived

15:26.093 --> 15:28.929
but then I looked across the street
and there was a motel.

15:29.596 --> 15:32.558
And behind that there was a dumpster.
I slept in a dumpster.

15:33.475 --> 15:35.769
- Jason!
- No, no, no, it was fine.

15:35.811 --> 15:38.188
And it was super fun getting to know you.

15:38.397 --> 15:40.190
You're the fanciest person I know.

15:40.232 --> 15:42.234
Next to my friend Ronnie,
who drives a limo.

15:42.359 --> 15:43.902
He's in limos all the time.

15:43.944 --> 15:45.738
Oh, what a life.

15:46.196 --> 15:49.199
Right. As soon as Eleanor gets here,
we'll begin.

15:49.283 --> 15:51.702
Bad news, prof,
Eleanor might not be coming.

15:51.744 --> 15:53.746
She bailed right after you did last night.

15:53.787 --> 15:57.750
Seemed like she was having second thoughts
about being part of the brainy bunch, so...

15:58.250 --> 15:59.543
Oh, well that's disappointing.

15:59.626 --> 16:00.753
In... in terms of...

16:01.336 --> 16:02.880
how it affects the study, but...

16:03.589 --> 16:05.841
we press on, like professionals.

16:13.015 --> 16:14.641
- Hey, do you think I should--
- Yeah.

16:14.725 --> 16:16.977
And I already called you a car
because you should not drive.

16:17.019 --> 16:18.854
- It's outside.
- Thanks.

16:23.275 --> 16:24.401
Where's outside?

16:31.617 --> 16:32.785
Hey, man.

16:36.371 --> 16:37.623
Are you OK?

16:37.748 --> 16:41.251
Sorry, uh, literally one second ago

16:42.002 --> 16:45.380
I was at the front desk.
Uh, don't know where I got this.

16:45.881 --> 16:48.342
Anyway, are you coming to class?

16:50.344 --> 16:52.471
I just don't think the
group thing is for me.

16:52.554 --> 16:54.139
I'm better when it's one-on-one

16:54.264 --> 16:58.102
and we're both looking at our phones
and I don't know the other person

16:58.185 --> 17:01.146
and we don't talk.
I might just head back to Arizona.

17:01.647 --> 17:03.273
L... listen.

17:04.608 --> 17:09.029
My whole life has been a...
a torture chamber of indecision

17:09.446 --> 17:12.533
and now I'm finally on the path
to understanding why

17:12.699 --> 17:15.994
and the only reason that's happening
is because you walked into my office

17:16.120 --> 17:18.330
and you said you wanted
to be a better person.

17:18.413 --> 17:19.790
That was really brave.

17:19.873 --> 17:24.753
Now, I know we barely know each other but...
please could you give me three months?

17:25.087 --> 17:29.133
Can you give me three months?
I am asking you as a friend.

17:30.592 --> 17:32.344
See, I just told you I don't like talking.

17:32.469 --> 17:35.764
That whole thing could have been sent
in a text that I pretended I never saw.

17:38.433 --> 17:41.770
Fine. You did good at talking.
I'll come back to class.

17:44.273 --> 17:46.400
Come in. No?

17:46.692 --> 17:48.152
- I'm gonna drive you back.
- OK.

17:50.028 --> 17:51.071
Hey.

17:51.655 --> 17:53.073
Hey, Dick Tracy called...

17:53.115 --> 17:57.494
said that I was right about Eleanor
and Chidi having an unbreakable bond.

17:57.578 --> 17:59.413
I don't think you understand
how that joke works.

17:59.496 --> 18:02.332
Yeah, that doesn't matter.
We won, that's the point.

18:02.499 --> 18:05.419
You won squat.
We're gonna get 'em eventually.

18:05.502 --> 18:08.338
I'll just keep chipping away
till one of 'em bails.

18:08.463 --> 18:11.508
These four humans are all I care about
in the universe

18:11.800 --> 18:14.011
and there is nothing, I mean nothing

18:14.094 --> 18:15.596
that's gonna come between me--

18:19.224 --> 18:20.893
Oh, cool. You're all together.

18:20.934 --> 18:22.102
The Judge wants to see you.

18:22.769 --> 18:24.521
Now? Right now?

18:24.605 --> 18:26.982
- Um, like all of us or--
- Yep.

18:28.817 --> 18:30.027
So this is Earth, huh?

18:32.779 --> 18:34.531
Whoo! Pretty cool.

18:45.500 --> 18:48.837
Michael, how many times
did I say you could go down to Earth?

18:49.171 --> 18:52.090
- Actually, you weren't 100% explicit--
- One time!

18:52.799 --> 18:55.219
I said you could go down there,
save their lives

18:55.260 --> 18:59.223
start the new time line
and then come back here to observe them.

18:59.306 --> 19:00.349
One time!

19:00.766 --> 19:02.976
Is what I said. <i>Uno!</i>

19:04.061 --> 19:05.270
One!

19:05.771 --> 19:09.983
Your Honour, I have to say, I support you
one "hundo" percent.

19:10.067 --> 19:13.070
I mean, what Michael did is unbelievable.

19:13.153 --> 19:16.490
Now, granted, I also tricked the Doorman
and snuck down to Earth

19:16.573 --> 19:18.867
but what are we gonna do--

19:18.909 --> 19:21.119
Do you realise what you did?

19:21.203 --> 19:23.914
You meddled in human affairs.

19:23.997 --> 19:26.250
That ripples out, man.

19:26.291 --> 19:30.212
Do you know how much weird stuff has
happened because of your little experiment?

19:30.254 --> 19:31.505
England left Europe.

19:31.964 --> 19:34.841
That Hugh Jackman musical
about P.T. Barnham...

19:34.883 --> 19:36.843
it made like 400 million dollars.

19:37.094 --> 19:40.722
Also, the Jacksonville Jaguars
are good now!

19:40.806 --> 19:42.015
Impossible!

19:42.057 --> 19:44.226
I'm serious!
They're gonna make the playoffs.

19:44.643 --> 19:47.271
Blake Bortles is kind of OK...

19:47.354 --> 19:50.357
Maybe? I don't know, it's being debated
amongst experts.

19:50.440 --> 19:54.194
It's confusing.
But whatever it is, it's yo' fault!

19:54.528 --> 19:56.446
Your experiment with the humans is over.

19:56.488 --> 19:58.240
- Are you gonna kill them?
- No.

19:59.199 --> 20:00.325
But starting now...

20:00.909 --> 20:02.536
there is no more monitoring them.

20:02.786 --> 20:06.290
They're just regular humans that need
to hit the regular point threshold

20:06.373 --> 20:07.833
to see if they make it into the Good Place.

20:07.874 --> 20:09.293
- Hm...
- And if they don't...

20:17.342 --> 20:20.429
And right now, the two of you
are going back to the Bad Place.

20:20.470 --> 20:21.763
But they'll retire Michael.

20:22.347 --> 20:23.515
And I'll be marbleised!

20:23.598 --> 20:26.184
Well, maybe you should have
thought about that

20:26.226 --> 20:29.521
before you intervened in human affairs!

20:29.771 --> 20:33.608
I mean, because of you, Byron Allen owns
The Weather Channel now.

20:34.401 --> 20:37.529
- Is-is that bad?
- I don't know, but it's weird, man!

20:38.113 --> 20:40.115
Now, come with me.

20:40.157 --> 20:42.492
Hey, my powers are back online.

20:43.910 --> 20:45.871
This must be everything
I tried to summon on Earth.

20:47.331 --> 20:49.958
- Stop it!
- I don't think I can. I'm like a printer

20:50.000 --> 20:53.253
when the print queue suddenly starts
processing all the unprinted documents...

20:54.713 --> 20:56.590
Oh, man! Buckle up, folks.

21:01.303 --> 21:03.472
Let's go. Right now!

21:03.764 --> 21:04.765
Janet!

21:05.390 --> 21:07.976
Make it stop! Janet, stop it!

21:09.019 --> 21:10.437
Janet, this is annoying!

21:11.730 --> 21:12.731
Janet!

21:13.940 --> 21:16.109
Good luck, frog man. I'm pulling for ya.

21:16.443 --> 21:18.153
Janet, I know you're still there.

21:25.911 --> 21:28.789
- They escaped.
- Yeah. Thanks, Jeff.
