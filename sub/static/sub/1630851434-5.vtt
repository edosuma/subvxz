WEBVTT

00:06.000 --> 00:07.958
A NETFLIX SERIES

00:28.541 --> 00:29.541
What are you doing?

00:30.708 --> 00:31.750
Easy.

00:35.916 --> 00:37.750
It's so nice in here!

00:37.833 --> 00:39.708
You chose some wonderful colors!

00:42.958 --> 00:44.791
It's very spacious too.

00:46.041 --> 00:47.958
You like the twist?!

00:48.041 --> 00:51.208
Me too.
It's a bit frivolous, but it's catchy.

00:51.291 --> 00:52.750
What are you doing here?

00:58.541 --> 01:00.625
I want to fix things between us.

01:03.875 --> 01:04.750
Rosa…

01:09.583 --> 01:11.666
My grandma told me everything.

01:12.333 --> 01:15.166
The story about the stroller isn't true.
I was kidnapped.

01:16.583 --> 01:18.125
By these people?

01:18.208 --> 01:21.291
If anything, these people saved me.

01:24.375 --> 01:26.541
Garbatella.
The low-income housing projects.

01:26.625 --> 01:29.250
-Do you know them?
-No! Of course I don't.

01:29.333 --> 01:31.000
That's where they found me.

01:31.083 --> 01:34.000
Locked up in a basement.
And there was a tall man with a cane.

01:34.083 --> 01:36.541
My grandmother thinks he was guarding me.

01:36.625 --> 01:39.375
If that's true,
we have to tell Mom and Dad now.

01:39.458 --> 01:42.333
No, Rosa.
I don't want to see you guys anymore.

01:42.416 --> 01:43.541
Why?

01:43.625 --> 01:46.000
Because if your parents find out,
your mother

01:46.833 --> 01:49.125
will take me away from here,
give me a tetanus shot

01:49.208 --> 01:50.916
and put a ribbon on my head.

01:51.000 --> 01:52.750
You're talking nonsense, Nora.

01:54.583 --> 01:55.500
Also,

01:57.166 --> 01:59.583
my father is the person
I love most in the world.

02:01.791 --> 02:04.583
If he finds out I'm not his daughter,
he'll never get over it.

02:04.666 --> 02:06.041
It would kill him.

02:07.250 --> 02:08.416
You might even discover

02:08.500 --> 02:11.916
something unpleasant
about your perfect family.

02:12.000 --> 02:15.083
Why? What happened to you
is definitely not their fault.

02:15.166 --> 02:17.833
How can you still believe
the story about the stroller?

02:18.458 --> 02:22.208
I envied you, you know?
I thought you had more courage than me.

02:22.291 --> 02:24.125
What does courage have to do with it?

02:25.666 --> 02:26.500
All right.

02:26.583 --> 02:29.833
So basically, you couldn't care less
about your real parents.

02:29.916 --> 02:32.166
You'd rather let them suffer, right?

02:33.583 --> 02:35.625
And you don't care about Simone either?

02:37.125 --> 02:39.375
No. I don't care about him.

02:39.458 --> 02:42.125
It's the first time
he's fallen in love, you know?

02:42.625 --> 02:45.125
I've never seen him
so crazy about someone.

02:46.208 --> 02:48.708
But you don't care.
Right, how silly of me!

02:49.458 --> 02:52.125
You know what?
I'm leaving. Do as you wish.

02:53.541 --> 02:54.500
Goodbye.

02:54.583 --> 02:56.041
-Where are you going?
-Going!

02:56.541 --> 02:58.958
You don't get it. No one can see you here.

03:01.916 --> 03:03.125
Come with me.

03:22.833 --> 03:25.291
How can you not care about me either?

03:26.333 --> 03:27.625
We're sisters.

03:28.541 --> 03:29.583
Twins.

03:29.666 --> 03:31.000
You can't really tell.

03:31.083 --> 03:32.791
At least we agree on one thing.

04:01.416 --> 04:04.083
I'll end up in jail,
so will your father. Well done!

04:04.166 --> 04:06.333
You're not going to jail, Grandma!

04:06.416 --> 04:07.833
Rosa won't tell anyone.

04:07.916 --> 04:10.208
You've been hanging out with those people.

04:10.291 --> 04:11.875
This is the first time you've lied to me.

04:11.958 --> 04:13.916
I grew up in a lie thanks to you.

04:15.625 --> 04:18.541
Maybe that's true.
I did raise you based on a lie.

04:19.250 --> 04:21.625
But it's done now,
and all you can do is forgive me.

04:22.125 --> 04:23.416
Why should I?

04:25.333 --> 04:26.250
Because…

04:27.541 --> 04:30.875
Because everyone has the right
to have a secret, that's why.

04:31.791 --> 04:33.000
Says who?

04:33.875 --> 04:35.541
Your grandmother does!

04:48.375 --> 04:50.166
Good morning. Hi.

04:50.250 --> 04:51.083
Matteo!

04:53.208 --> 04:56.250
-What are you doing here?
-I need to ask you a favor.

04:57.708 --> 04:59.875
Didn't we establish
it was all in your head?

04:59.958 --> 05:02.083
No, not after what I saw last night.

05:04.708 --> 05:05.916
Ralli is guilty.

05:06.000 --> 05:07.708
Let me use the darkroom.

05:08.458 --> 05:10.416
Matteo, I'm not asking as your brother,

05:11.083 --> 05:12.708
I'm asking as a journalist.

05:18.541 --> 05:19.666
Come with me.

05:27.666 --> 05:29.416
This is heaven!

05:30.750 --> 05:33.541
-Look at this machine!
-Yeah, better than sex!

05:33.625 --> 05:34.916
Like you would know!

05:35.875 --> 05:39.625
Let's just say that Rosa's been reading
modern literature lately.

05:39.708 --> 05:41.500
Now I have to keep up with her.

05:46.500 --> 05:48.833
Let me get to work now. Go.

05:51.333 --> 05:53.500
-Behave yourself.
-Yes.

06:09.875 --> 06:11.750
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

06:14.083 --> 06:15.416
What happened here?

06:15.500 --> 06:17.708
-The canopy fell.
-Where were you?

06:19.333 --> 06:20.333
Let me help you.

06:20.416 --> 06:23.791
This was my gift to you.
If it breaks, I have to fix it.

06:25.791 --> 06:27.208
-Ettore?
-Yes?

06:27.833 --> 06:29.458
My sketches for The Flight are gone.

06:30.083 --> 06:31.958
-Yes, I know.
-How do you know?

06:32.041 --> 06:33.208
Did you take them?

06:34.500 --> 06:35.333
Why?

06:37.750 --> 06:38.750
It's a surprise.

06:38.833 --> 06:41.375
I don't like surprises. Come with me.

06:51.541 --> 06:54.416
I just took the sketches
for The Flight and I gave them to

06:55.750 --> 06:58.208
a manufacturing company
that will make an amazing ride.

06:58.291 --> 07:00.666
It was supposed to be a gift,
not get you so upset.

07:01.833 --> 07:03.791
You took the Grottas' offer?

07:04.625 --> 07:05.958
Yes.

07:11.583 --> 07:13.458
It would've been foolish not to.

07:14.250 --> 07:16.916
What kind of deal did they offer you
for this much money?

07:20.041 --> 07:23.166
Listen, if you want me to stay,
you have to give me some space.

07:23.250 --> 07:24.833
-I can't always--
-No!

07:24.916 --> 07:28.458
Because if the police shut us down,
we're all ruined!

07:28.541 --> 07:30.916
What? I'm doing this for all of us!

07:31.000 --> 07:33.208
For you, for that old hag
and for your daughter!

07:33.291 --> 07:36.000
-Leave my daughter out of it.
-Why should I?

07:36.083 --> 07:38.791
Did you see the guy
she's going out with? Did you?

07:38.875 --> 07:40.250
What are you talking about?

07:40.333 --> 07:43.041
You don't know
because your head is up in the clouds!

07:43.125 --> 07:44.875
He's rich, with nice clothes,

07:44.958 --> 07:48.333
and a camera that's worth more
than this whole place!

07:48.416 --> 07:52.083
Your daughter is ashamed of you.
She's ashamed of you, me, everyone here!

08:08.583 --> 08:09.833
Look, I'm sorry.

08:13.125 --> 08:15.125
Why are we even arguing?

08:18.958 --> 08:20.208
Let's put it this way.

08:21.250 --> 08:23.666
You took care of Tina
to clear your conscience.

08:24.250 --> 08:25.083
I know.

08:25.166 --> 08:26.791
And I fucked up,

08:27.625 --> 08:30.208
and to clear my own conscience,
I bought you a ride.

08:33.875 --> 08:34.916
Ettore.

08:35.500 --> 08:37.666
We cannot get into more shady stuff.

08:40.916 --> 08:42.000
The war is over.

08:48.041 --> 08:50.416
For people like us, the war is never over.

08:52.000 --> 08:53.000
Never.

10:31.500 --> 10:32.625
Simone?

10:35.041 --> 10:36.041
Simone!

10:36.750 --> 10:38.291
So? How did it go?

10:39.041 --> 10:41.166
You were right. There's nothing to see.

10:49.000 --> 10:50.000
I was being an idiot.

10:51.500 --> 10:52.333
Bye.

10:54.625 --> 10:55.666
Bye.

11:09.833 --> 11:13.166
And now, ladies and gentlemen,
our new game!

11:13.250 --> 11:16.250
Come and play
the Music Betting Slip with us!

11:16.333 --> 11:19.750
Guess the ten biggest hits of the week

11:19.833 --> 11:22.750
and you will win
a state-of-the-art refrigerator.

11:27.750 --> 11:28.583
Giggi!

11:29.208 --> 11:30.333
Fuck.

11:30.416 --> 11:33.875
-One scratch and you're paying for it!
-No, there are no scratches.

11:33.958 --> 11:36.541
I barely touched it.
It's like it's made of cardboard.

11:36.625 --> 11:38.500
It's cheap! Like you!

11:38.583 --> 11:42.083
Who decided to entrust a show like this
to a 20-year-old moron?

11:42.166 --> 11:43.458
You did.

11:44.458 --> 11:47.791
Because you hired me, that's why.

11:54.083 --> 11:55.958
This is the perfect time
for a coffee break.

11:56.833 --> 11:58.333
Sandro, my dear!

11:59.208 --> 12:01.291
Excuse me, but Sandro Ralli needs me.

12:14.708 --> 12:17.833
I think I had a bit too much to drink
at the party last night.

12:19.708 --> 12:20.833
But I remember.

12:21.333 --> 12:22.208
Oh, I remember.

12:23.250 --> 12:25.250
You and your friend were there.

12:27.041 --> 12:29.041
Tell me if I'm wrong,
but you two helped me and--

12:29.125 --> 12:32.458
Yes. Don't worry, though.
It's happened to me a lot.

12:32.541 --> 12:35.416
Listen, did I happen to say
anything weird?

12:37.333 --> 12:39.833
-Because when I drink, I talk nonsense.
-Like what?

12:40.416 --> 12:41.333
I don't know.

12:41.875 --> 12:43.041
I don't remember a thing.

12:44.500 --> 12:47.791
Me neither.
After all those drinks, I mean…

12:47.875 --> 12:49.625
It was some night, huh?

12:53.791 --> 12:55.416
Sandro, can you teach me?

12:56.333 --> 12:58.208
-You want to smoke?
-Yes.

12:59.375 --> 13:01.750
It would be a pleasure, my friend.

13:01.833 --> 13:02.708
Please.

13:03.541 --> 13:05.791
You should know that smoking is an art.

13:06.291 --> 13:07.625
It's like acting.

13:09.208 --> 13:11.625
-You need practice.
-So I have to do it often?

13:11.708 --> 13:13.875
Did you see those American actors,
like James Dean?

13:13.958 --> 13:16.958
What do they do? They're famous
because they use their hand.

13:17.041 --> 13:18.416
The hand is their secret.

13:18.500 --> 13:21.000
You get your hand
slowly closer to your face.

13:21.083 --> 13:23.333
-Slower, Giggi.
-Slower.

13:23.416 --> 13:26.166
And then, you take a nice long puff.

13:35.416 --> 13:37.708
-That's why you need practice.
-I'm sorry.

13:43.833 --> 13:46.416
-You look just like Marlon Brando.
-Yeah, right.

13:49.166 --> 13:51.083
You should be happy, Giggi.

13:52.666 --> 13:54.708
Starting tomorrow, you'll be famous too.

13:54.791 --> 13:56.333
Cars, parties,

13:56.875 --> 13:58.541
surrounded by women.

13:58.625 --> 14:00.333
I bet it feels great, doesn't it?

14:02.000 --> 14:05.333
You'll be surrounded by women,
but not a single male friend, Giggi.

14:05.416 --> 14:08.333
Well, I mean,
there's worse things in life.

14:08.916 --> 14:10.208
Did you drive here?

14:10.291 --> 14:12.500
No. My ditzy sister
is driving the car today.

14:12.583 --> 14:14.375
No problem. I'll give you a ride.

14:15.333 --> 14:17.000
If it's not too much trouble.

14:17.083 --> 14:18.375
Not at all.

14:27.125 --> 14:28.791
What are you learning that for?

14:29.291 --> 14:31.791
As soon as the lights go off,
you fall asleep.

14:32.375 --> 14:34.541
I want to stay awake this time.

14:34.625 --> 14:37.708
Because you're trying to impress
the Baldis. Am I right?

14:38.458 --> 14:40.583
You're starting to like them too.
Admit it.

14:40.666 --> 14:44.125
No way! We just spent
one fun evening together, that's all.

14:46.541 --> 14:50.166
Do you realize that Rosa and Matteo
have serious feelings for each other?

14:50.250 --> 14:54.083
And do you realize that I will never
let some commies become family?

14:55.041 --> 14:56.333
Rosa is changing.

14:58.000 --> 14:59.666
We made a mistake with her.

15:00.416 --> 15:02.666
We raised her inside a bubble.

15:02.750 --> 15:05.666
Oh, come on. What bubble?
Don't be dramatic.

15:05.750 --> 15:09.583
We would have been better parents
had we not lost Adele.

15:09.666 --> 15:11.916
Rosa turned out just fine.

15:12.666 --> 15:13.791
Yes, that's true.

15:14.375 --> 15:16.541
But she's looking for something different.

15:17.208 --> 15:19.583
You should see this new friend of hers.

15:19.666 --> 15:23.666
She's bizarre,
to say the least, and Matteo…

15:23.750 --> 15:25.333
Matteo is different too.

15:25.833 --> 15:27.500
Communists are not different.

15:28.583 --> 15:29.500
What?

15:30.708 --> 15:34.916
We give to charity too, but, unlike them,
we don't expect to change the world.

15:35.708 --> 15:37.375
They just chat about it a lot.

15:38.541 --> 15:40.500
Chat counts, it really does.

15:41.166 --> 15:42.458
And so does silence.

15:43.416 --> 15:46.625
Doriana was right. There's always
too much noise in this house.

15:51.041 --> 15:54.583
He showed up at the rehearsal
out of nowhere.

15:55.458 --> 15:56.583
He was acting strange.

15:57.416 --> 15:59.083
He wasn't. He was worried.

15:59.750 --> 16:03.250
He wanted to know if we understood
what he was raving about last night.

16:04.041 --> 16:07.250
Or maybe he thinks I'm a nice guy
because I am a nice guy.

16:07.333 --> 16:09.125
No, that's out of the question.

16:09.208 --> 16:10.416
What do you mean no?

16:12.041 --> 16:15.791
You don't get it. He's just using you.
He wants to control you.

16:16.541 --> 16:18.958
Are you sure you're not just jealous?

16:19.041 --> 16:20.416
Are you insane?

16:20.500 --> 16:23.625
You should see how fast he drives his car.

16:23.708 --> 16:25.416
We got stopped by the police,

16:25.500 --> 16:28.875
but when they saw, they asked
for his autograph and let us go.

16:29.750 --> 16:32.833
If he really did kill Gioia,
he'd be untouchable, you know?

16:32.916 --> 16:34.083
So he killed her?

16:36.750 --> 16:38.375
What was in those pictures?

16:40.916 --> 16:42.166
What's going on?

16:42.250 --> 16:44.583
Simone used the darkroom at the newspaper.

16:44.666 --> 16:47.208
Yes, but nothing showed up.

16:47.291 --> 16:48.125
Tell me the truth.

16:49.375 --> 16:51.916
It is the truth! God, this is so boring!

16:53.791 --> 16:55.541
You're trying to protect us, right?

16:56.333 --> 16:59.291
I can tell you're afraid for us.
And for Nora.

16:59.375 --> 17:01.375
Nora doesn't want to see us anymore.

17:01.458 --> 17:02.541
What?

17:02.625 --> 17:05.166
She said she wants nothing to do with us.

17:05.250 --> 17:06.375
Including me?

17:06.458 --> 17:08.083
Especially you.

17:08.166 --> 17:09.416
Rosa.

17:09.500 --> 17:11.791
Please, don't be so insensitive.

17:11.875 --> 17:13.916
Show some tact with this young man.

17:14.000 --> 17:16.416
He just lost his best friend,
that would be me,

17:16.500 --> 17:18.000
and now his girlfriend too.

17:18.083 --> 17:19.458
-Will you stop it?
-Hey!

17:19.541 --> 17:20.750
Have you gone crazy?

17:23.375 --> 17:26.666
-Let's go take a walk.
-No! Please, leave me alone!

17:36.458 --> 17:38.000
-All right.
-He's lost it.

17:58.958 --> 17:59.875
Hey. Give me that.

18:03.541 --> 18:04.541
No.

18:09.250 --> 18:13.041
If you make it too tight,
it'll be jerky when it moves.

18:15.500 --> 18:18.250
It has to float up, slowly.

18:18.333 --> 18:20.083
In the air, right?

18:20.166 --> 18:22.291
Like a child dreaming of flying.

18:23.458 --> 18:24.333
Understand?

19:24.166 --> 19:25.000
Go, Tina!

19:30.916 --> 19:32.291
Bravo!

19:32.791 --> 19:33.750
Bravo!

19:38.166 --> 19:41.750
I'm sorry. I'll just steal the stage
for a minute, ladies and gentlemen.

19:42.333 --> 19:44.583
I took the liberty
of organizing this little party,

19:44.666 --> 19:46.666
first of all, to thank my brother,

19:46.750 --> 19:48.291
my beautiful niece,

19:49.500 --> 19:54.208
and all of you, who with your kindness
and your affection

19:55.833 --> 19:58.125
have basically
given me no choice but to stay.

19:58.208 --> 19:59.500
Long live the carnival!

19:59.583 --> 20:01.083
Hurray!

20:01.166 --> 20:02.333
Music!

20:03.125 --> 20:04.375
Music!

20:14.916 --> 20:15.958
Good job.

20:54.458 --> 20:56.291
-You're so beautiful!
-Put me down!

21:17.375 --> 21:18.208
Nice!

23:12.166 --> 23:14.500
I should close the door

23:15.125 --> 23:17.958
Now I'm closing the door

23:18.791 --> 23:20.875
Now I'm closing it.

23:31.125 --> 23:33.291
-Are you nuts?
-No, you're nuts.

23:35.041 --> 23:37.500
What are you doing up?
It must be two in the morning.

23:38.083 --> 23:39.416
I was waiting for you.

23:40.166 --> 23:41.041
Why?

23:42.000 --> 23:43.375
What an honor!

23:46.375 --> 23:48.458
You want my car keys,

23:48.541 --> 23:49.916
but I won't give them to you.

23:50.000 --> 23:52.041
No, I don't want your car, Giggi!

23:52.125 --> 23:54.666
-No?
-Come on. I have something to show you.

23:54.750 --> 23:56.958
-No, please.
-Come on! Come with me!

23:57.041 --> 23:58.416
Pretty please!

24:06.125 --> 24:07.333
You know who this guy is?

24:08.250 --> 24:09.708
I have no idea.

24:09.791 --> 24:13.041
Isn't it weird? It's a photo
from my christening. He must be family.

24:13.125 --> 24:16.583
Yes, maybe, but you know, Rosa,
I wasn't even born at that time.

24:16.666 --> 24:18.208
What's your point, Rosa?

24:18.291 --> 24:21.958
I don't know. But something doesn't
add up in our sister's story. Right?

24:22.541 --> 24:25.041
Yes. Something doesn't add up.

24:25.125 --> 24:28.166
But you'll have to excuse me, Rosa,
because I'm exhausted.

24:28.791 --> 24:31.583
I'm exhausted because tonight
I was at one of those parties

24:31.666 --> 24:34.708
where you really need to know
how to dance,

24:35.250 --> 24:38.791
how to sing,
and you also need to be a smooth talker.

24:38.875 --> 24:42.583
Because smooth talk,
done properly, sometimes can--

24:43.250 --> 24:44.958
-Ouch!
-Giggi! What are you doing?

24:45.041 --> 24:47.625
-This chair is very small.
-Oh, come on.

24:50.958 --> 24:52.250
Wait.

24:53.916 --> 24:55.208
I'm listening.

24:57.458 --> 24:58.291
Nora

24:58.791 --> 24:59.916
is our sister.

25:00.500 --> 25:02.625
-Oh God. You've lost it!
-It's true.

25:02.708 --> 25:04.000
Her grandma confessed to it.

25:04.083 --> 25:07.291
But the version she told Nora
is a bit different from the one we know.

25:07.375 --> 25:09.083
Whose grandma? What version?

25:09.166 --> 25:12.000
The carnies found her
locked up in a basement.

25:12.083 --> 25:15.750
And there was a tall man with a cane,
hanging around nearby.

25:16.416 --> 25:18.583
A tall man with a cane!

25:18.666 --> 25:22.041
What a unique specimen! It must be him!

25:24.583 --> 25:26.333
Rosa, don't you get it?

25:27.166 --> 25:30.208
-She's playing you!
-She'd have no reason to, Giggi!

25:30.291 --> 25:32.916
Why don't you believe me?
Nora is our sister.

25:37.833 --> 25:38.916
Come here.

25:44.125 --> 25:45.625
You're not going to find her.

25:48.250 --> 25:49.916
Hey, look at me.

25:54.541 --> 25:56.416
You'll have to make do with me.

25:58.250 --> 25:59.916
I care about you a lot.

26:01.416 --> 26:03.666
That's why I'm telling you the truth.

26:06.958 --> 26:08.083
All right.

26:09.083 --> 26:11.500
Now talk about it with Dad, then.

26:12.166 --> 26:14.041
Tell him what Nora told you.

26:14.125 --> 26:18.791
Show him the photo of the tall, shady man
so you can snap out of it. Goodnight.

26:18.875 --> 26:20.708
You know I can't do that, Giggi.

26:23.041 --> 26:26.291
Besides, Dad might not want to
tell us the whole truth.

26:29.375 --> 26:32.458
No, I had nothing to do with this!

26:33.583 --> 26:37.625
No! It was him!
He allowed the Gabriellis to buy the land!

26:37.708 --> 26:40.666
-That's not true!
-It was him! Because he is…

26:43.375 --> 26:45.458
-We'll go on strike!
-Strike it is!

26:56.916 --> 26:58.083
I'm fine.

26:58.708 --> 26:59.583
Giggi.

27:02.625 --> 27:03.458
He's good.

27:03.541 --> 27:05.833
Come on.
The merry-go-round is about to start!

27:05.916 --> 27:07.750
Come, quick!

27:07.833 --> 27:10.083
-The horses are leaving! Come with me!
-Kids.

27:10.166 --> 27:13.166
-Come here.
-One, two…

27:13.250 --> 27:15.583
All set? Everybody ready?

27:16.083 --> 27:18.041
Say, "Bye, mom! We're leaving!"

27:18.125 --> 27:19.125
Bye!

27:19.750 --> 27:21.916
Celeste! I'll be right there.

27:46.916 --> 27:50.291
Nora! I don't get it. I opened up to you.

27:50.375 --> 27:53.875
I was there for you.
And now you don't want to see me anymore?

27:53.958 --> 27:55.625
Sorry, you're right, but I…

27:55.708 --> 27:57.916
I have something to show you. Come on.

27:58.000 --> 27:59.416
I'm working.

27:59.500 --> 28:00.916
It's important.

28:23.416 --> 28:24.291
So?

28:25.166 --> 28:26.541
Why are we here?

28:26.625 --> 28:27.458
Look.

28:32.208 --> 28:33.833
Oh my God, he killed her!

28:33.916 --> 28:36.458
-He strangled her!
-Lower your voice.

28:36.541 --> 28:37.833
What do your friends say?

28:38.333 --> 28:41.291
Nobody else knows.
I didn't want to put them in danger.

28:41.375 --> 28:44.291
Simone, if you take this
to the newspaper, you'll be rich.

28:45.833 --> 28:46.958
Yes, but…

28:47.041 --> 28:48.708
I don't want to anymore.

28:48.791 --> 28:49.666
Why?

28:49.750 --> 28:52.750
Ralli is a money machine.
And we're taking a huge risk.

28:52.833 --> 28:55.458
Think about Gioia's parents.
They must be desperate.

28:56.208 --> 28:58.083
We have to take them to the police.

28:58.166 --> 28:59.958
We could leave the photos anonymously.

29:00.041 --> 29:01.750
-Yes. Let's go.
-Let's go.

29:08.250 --> 29:09.791
-Who is it?
-It's Minnella.

29:09.875 --> 29:11.250
At this time of night?

29:12.250 --> 29:14.333
Someone better have died.

29:14.416 --> 29:16.541
They did, in fact, as you well know.

29:16.625 --> 29:19.833
There are two witnesses
who know what your protégé did.

29:19.916 --> 29:20.750
A young couple.

29:20.833 --> 29:22.500
They even took photos.

29:22.583 --> 29:24.208
Tell me you're joking. Please.

29:26.041 --> 29:27.500
I can take care of it.

29:28.250 --> 29:30.208
But this involves a lot more risk.

29:30.291 --> 29:33.000
Ralli can afford it. Name your price.

29:33.083 --> 29:34.833
It'll have to reflect the risk.

29:34.916 --> 29:37.875
All right! Just make sure
you do everything you can.

30:00.958 --> 30:03.500
I know you think I made a mistake, honey.

30:04.083 --> 30:05.833
Maybe I shouldn't have said anything.

30:05.916 --> 30:09.625
But please, don't hate me.
We need you to watch over us, my love.

30:11.666 --> 30:12.916
Watch over Nora.

30:14.250 --> 30:18.000
She's spinning out of control,
and I'm sure she'll do something stupid.

30:18.666 --> 30:20.291
And watch over your husband too.

30:21.166 --> 30:22.916
Because if he finds out the truth…

30:24.916 --> 30:26.416
his heart will break in two.

30:28.500 --> 30:30.458
Please help us, my child.

30:36.500 --> 30:37.458
Stella?

30:38.666 --> 30:39.541
Stella?

30:40.125 --> 30:41.000
Who's there?

30:42.666 --> 30:43.541
Is that you?

31:02.916 --> 31:04.125
Okay. I'll go now.

31:05.000 --> 31:06.333
When will I see you again?

31:07.250 --> 31:08.250
I don't know.

31:09.666 --> 31:13.291
My grandma told me everything.
It's true, the Gabriellis are my parents.

31:14.291 --> 31:15.916
So why don't you want to see them?

31:16.000 --> 31:18.000
Because I chose my true family over them.

31:18.083 --> 31:19.083
What about me?

31:19.166 --> 31:21.583
You're too close to them. It's dangerous.

31:21.666 --> 31:23.125
My dad could find out.

31:23.208 --> 31:26.125
Nora, you don't have to pick a side.

31:26.208 --> 31:28.208
Who said you can't stand in the middle?

31:28.916 --> 31:30.958
Rosa is right, I don't have the courage.

31:31.041 --> 31:32.291
Nora…

31:36.083 --> 31:37.416
I don't want to lose you.

31:41.750 --> 31:45.125
Simone, we went on one date.
It's not like we are--

31:55.083 --> 31:57.208
Come on. Enough bullshit.

32:00.583 --> 32:02.166
The Baldis again?

32:02.250 --> 32:03.708
You said they weren't spies.

32:04.291 --> 32:06.916
Just like I've been saying since day one.

32:07.750 --> 32:09.333
Lando and Doriana are okay.

32:09.916 --> 32:11.875
But I have a problem with their son.

32:12.500 --> 32:14.000
-Which one? Matteo?
-No.

32:15.625 --> 32:16.458
The other one.

32:17.916 --> 32:19.416
Do me a favor.

32:19.500 --> 32:22.458
Find a way for me
to have a private chat with him.

32:22.541 --> 32:24.541
I have to talk to him alone.

32:24.625 --> 32:25.625
About what?

32:27.041 --> 32:28.791
Just take the kid somewhere.

32:29.666 --> 32:30.916
Somewhere quiet.

32:32.208 --> 32:33.583
And leave him there for me.

32:36.750 --> 32:39.500
We both know how you paid
for that thingamajig.

32:41.541 --> 32:43.333
Just tell me what Ettore did.

32:43.416 --> 32:44.458
He won't say.

32:46.875 --> 32:48.875
He has brought negative energy here.

32:59.458 --> 33:01.583
There's a spirit in the park, Antonio.

33:05.250 --> 33:06.333
I felt it.

33:09.541 --> 33:11.291
You know I have a gift, don't you?

33:13.125 --> 33:15.000
Making up bullshit, that's your gift.

33:15.083 --> 33:16.500
Listen to me.

33:17.875 --> 33:19.583
There's a spirit that

33:20.416 --> 33:21.750
is searching for peace.

33:26.416 --> 33:27.750
It's my spirit, Miranda.

33:30.083 --> 33:31.125
Be quiet.

33:32.083 --> 33:35.708
Quit summoning spirits, and go back
to the accounting. It's for the best.

33:56.250 --> 33:57.416
Good afternoon!

33:58.166 --> 33:59.125
Hello, love!

34:00.333 --> 34:01.250
What's going on?

34:01.333 --> 34:03.833
We're setting up the room
to enjoy the show.

34:03.916 --> 34:05.125
What show?

34:05.208 --> 34:07.250
Giggi's show. It's tonight.

34:07.333 --> 34:09.458
Right! Giggi's show is tonight.

34:09.541 --> 34:10.541
Thank you.

34:10.625 --> 34:13.250
-Honey, will you help us?
-Mom, I'm studying. Please.

34:13.333 --> 34:14.625
How many guests are coming?

34:14.708 --> 34:17.250
Actually, it will only be us and the help.

34:17.333 --> 34:18.583
No Matteo and Simone?

34:18.666 --> 34:21.708
They're at the studios with Giggi,
for emotional support.

34:21.791 --> 34:23.625
Oh, well. He surely needs that.

34:23.708 --> 34:26.625
All this stuff just for us?
Isn't it a bit too much, my love?

34:26.708 --> 34:27.750
No!

34:27.833 --> 34:30.083
Look at this picture I found
of Adele and I.

34:30.166 --> 34:31.291
Let me see.

34:35.833 --> 34:36.833
It's nice, isn't it?

34:37.500 --> 34:38.625
Yes, very nice.

34:38.708 --> 34:40.500
-Where did you find it?
-In the attic.

34:40.583 --> 34:41.708
What's that, dear?

34:41.791 --> 34:44.375
A photo of our christening, I believe.

34:44.458 --> 34:45.666
Let me see.

34:45.750 --> 34:48.125
-Oh, look. Alfio.
-Who's Alfio?

34:48.833 --> 34:52.000
Alfio, your godfather.
He was a special person.

34:52.083 --> 34:56.333
But he ran off to America with his family,
and we never heard from him again.

34:56.416 --> 34:57.958
Oh really? And when was that?

34:58.041 --> 34:59.833
A long time ago, during the war.

34:59.916 --> 35:02.041
It's an old story.
Let's not talk about it.

35:02.125 --> 35:04.291
So when's the show going to start?

35:04.375 --> 35:07.125
In a couple of hours.
Were you really good friends, Dad?

35:07.625 --> 35:09.916
-Well, yes.
-Inseparable.

35:10.750 --> 35:12.958
You wouldn't remember, dear.
You were tiny.

35:13.041 --> 35:14.416
Just a baby.

35:15.083 --> 35:19.041
Listen, I'll go make
a couple of phone calls in my study.

35:19.541 --> 35:20.375
My love?

35:21.291 --> 35:22.916
-My love?
-Yes.

35:23.000 --> 35:25.166
-I'll be right back, my love.
-Okay.

35:26.166 --> 35:27.000
Nora?

35:27.666 --> 35:30.416
Can you come outside
and help me put the sign up?

35:30.500 --> 35:31.416
No. Ask Celeste.

35:34.541 --> 35:37.000
Right. You don't care
about the Luna Park anymore.

35:37.833 --> 35:39.291
What are you talking about?

35:39.375 --> 35:40.708
That's not true!

35:40.791 --> 35:43.541
-I wish you were a bit more free.
-More than I already am?

35:43.625 --> 35:45.708
If someone's free, they don't run away.

35:45.791 --> 35:47.916
You're dating someone
but pretend you're not.

35:50.041 --> 35:51.500
You have no clue, Dad.

35:52.333 --> 35:53.833
I want you to be happy.

35:55.791 --> 35:57.000
Don't I look happy to you?

35:58.541 --> 35:59.666
Are you?

36:00.458 --> 36:01.583
No.

36:01.666 --> 36:02.916
I'm running away.

36:05.250 --> 36:08.041
Not from you though. Not from us.

36:09.291 --> 36:10.500
I would never.

36:13.083 --> 36:15.541
What are you running away from, then?

36:18.791 --> 36:20.250
Listen, sweetheart.

36:20.333 --> 36:23.000
Whatever the problem is,
you have to be yourself.

36:23.875 --> 36:25.125
You have to be Nora.

36:26.958 --> 36:28.833
Are you ready? Do you know the lines?

36:28.916 --> 36:30.083
I sure do.

36:30.166 --> 36:33.166
The contestants, though,
I don't know where they found them.

36:33.250 --> 36:35.833
One forgets his lines,
another can't find his mark.

36:35.916 --> 36:39.166
They're incompetent.
I don't know. It's going to be a disaster.

36:39.250 --> 36:40.416
It's going to be fine.

36:43.000 --> 36:45.166
-Where's my champ?
-Sandro.

36:45.250 --> 36:48.000
Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Cinema.

36:49.041 --> 36:51.125
But what have you done, Sandro?

36:51.208 --> 36:53.083
You'll steal the spotlight in that suit.

36:53.708 --> 36:56.083
You think this is too much?
I'll take it off.

36:56.166 --> 36:59.000
No. That'd be worse.
You'd steal the spotlight even more.

36:59.833 --> 37:02.333
Sandro will do me the honor
of being my guest star.

37:03.083 --> 37:04.083
Your what?

37:04.166 --> 37:07.416
My guest star.
Like a special guest, you know?

37:08.041 --> 37:09.166
These are my friends.

37:09.708 --> 37:13.125
-Sandro Ralli. My pleasure.
-Yes, I know who you are. Matteo Baldi.

37:14.416 --> 37:15.666
And you are?

37:17.250 --> 37:20.541
-Simone.
-I think we've met before, haven't we?

37:21.166 --> 37:23.333
-No. I don't think so.
-I could've sworn we have.

37:23.416 --> 37:25.000
-Champagne?
-I don't drink.

37:25.083 --> 37:27.000
Bambi, are you ready?

37:27.083 --> 37:28.208
Yes, of course.

37:28.291 --> 37:32.208
Bambi is just a pet name.
Please, forget it. Excuse me.

37:35.458 --> 37:36.291
Excuse me.

37:41.541 --> 37:43.250
So? Do you like it?

37:43.333 --> 37:44.416
THE FLIGHT

37:44.500 --> 37:46.291
-It's beautiful.
-Shall we?

37:47.416 --> 37:50.333
I have to do something first.
You were right.

38:19.833 --> 38:22.958
Ladies and gentlemen,
good evening and welcome.

38:23.041 --> 38:26.208
I am Giggi Gabrielli
and this is Musicherò!

38:26.291 --> 38:27.125
Turn it up.

38:27.208 --> 38:29.083
APPLAUSE

38:30.625 --> 38:34.875
The most amazing music quiz show
on Italian television.

38:34.958 --> 38:36.333
After Canzonissima, of course.

38:36.416 --> 38:40.041
But only here can you compete and even win

38:40.125 --> 38:42.708
with our exclusive Music Betting Slip.

38:42.791 --> 38:45.875
Let's go and find out who our guests are
for this first episode,

38:45.958 --> 38:48.333
other than my wonderful jacket, of course!

38:48.416 --> 38:50.291
Our three contestants!

38:50.375 --> 38:54.208
Paola from Rome, Lino from Verona,
and Stefania from Catania!

38:54.291 --> 38:55.416
It even rhymes.

38:56.458 --> 38:58.958
Also, we have a special guest.

38:59.041 --> 39:00.291
For our opening night,

39:00.375 --> 39:02.666
we have our own "guest star,"

39:02.750 --> 39:04.458
as they would say in America.

39:04.541 --> 39:05.791
Here on Musicherò,

39:05.875 --> 39:08.041
Italy's most famous
and best-looking actor,

39:08.125 --> 39:09.625
with the slickest hairdo,

39:09.708 --> 39:11.541
Sandro Ralli!

39:14.541 --> 39:15.750
It's such a pleasure

39:15.833 --> 39:18.875
and honor to have you as a godfather
to this… What do we call it?

39:18.958 --> 39:19.916
Baptism of fire?

39:20.000 --> 39:21.916
The pleasure is mine.
I'll say a few words.

39:22.000 --> 39:23.250
Of course.

39:23.333 --> 39:24.583
Ladies and gentlemen,

39:25.250 --> 39:27.875
tonight, on this stage,
you're looking at what, exactly?

39:28.416 --> 39:29.250
The past,

39:29.833 --> 39:30.750
the present,

39:31.333 --> 39:32.291
and the future.

39:32.375 --> 39:33.583
Giggi Gabrielli.

39:35.333 --> 39:37.958
-Is he wearing makeup?
-That's what they do on TV.

39:38.041 --> 39:39.500
Isn't it a bit too much?

39:39.583 --> 39:41.208
Yes. He looks like Grandma Ada.

39:43.458 --> 39:46.250
Not to mention the jacket! Is that his?

39:46.333 --> 39:47.916
No, he looks sharp. I like it.

39:48.000 --> 39:49.666
-He looks like a Christmas tree.
-No.

39:49.750 --> 39:52.583
It's very simple. All you have to do
is guess the missing word

39:52.666 --> 39:56.625
from the song that our wonderful
orchestra will play for you live.

39:56.708 --> 39:59.666
Wow, he's good! He's great, isn't he?

39:59.750 --> 40:01.958
-You think?
-He's great, Mommy.

40:02.041 --> 40:04.708
Remember to push the buzzer

40:04.791 --> 40:07.750
only when you're absolutely sure
you know the answer, okay?

40:07.833 --> 40:10.333
You have to be sure, all right?

40:10.416 --> 40:12.250
Sandro, what's left to say?

40:12.333 --> 40:16.708
All we can do is listen
to the song for round number one.

40:16.791 --> 40:17.833
Orchestra, music!

40:19.833 --> 40:22.541
Those incredible tan lines

40:25.375 --> 40:27.791
And the sunburned skin

40:27.875 --> 40:29.333
I love this song.

40:29.416 --> 40:32.333
-I know this one.
-Of course. We all do.

40:32.416 --> 40:34.041
But there's one girl

40:35.791 --> 40:38.083
Who's bathing

40:39.083 --> 40:40.000
In the…

40:45.208 --> 40:50.625
Paola from Rome!

40:50.708 --> 40:54.000
A fellow Roman! So please, don't make us
look bad. Okay, Paola from Rome?

40:54.791 --> 40:58.833
So, Paola from Rome,
what does this girl bathe in?

40:58.916 --> 41:00.958
-Sun lotion.
-Sun lotion!

41:01.041 --> 41:02.291
No. What?

41:02.375 --> 41:03.750
-No!
-Sun lotion?

41:03.833 --> 41:05.500
Where do they find these people?

41:05.583 --> 41:07.333
Sandro, could it be the sun lotion?

41:07.416 --> 41:09.541
No, ma'am. You slipped on the sun lotion.

41:10.333 --> 41:13.750
-Esther, even you know this one.
-Even Esther knows the answer.

41:13.833 --> 41:16.333
…only when you are absolutely sure.

41:16.416 --> 41:18.833
Holy mackerel! Don't do it again.
Lino from Verona!

41:18.916 --> 41:20.541
Look at the faces he's making.

41:21.083 --> 41:23.083
I think he looks really good on camera.

41:23.166 --> 41:24.500
-Yes.
-Yes.

41:24.583 --> 41:27.291
-What does the girl bathe in?
-Under a parasol?

41:27.375 --> 41:29.541
A parasol? No. It's not a parasol.

41:29.625 --> 41:31.750
Don't worry, Esther.
I'll get it. I'm here.

41:31.833 --> 41:33.458
No, Lino! You should…

41:34.208 --> 41:37.750
You should pay attention
to the hints we give. I mean,

41:37.833 --> 41:41.666
There's one who bathes in…

41:41.750 --> 41:44.541
What does she bathe in,
Stefania from Catania?

41:45.291 --> 41:48.625
What is it? Stefania from Catania,
what does she bathe in?

41:48.708 --> 41:52.333
Nothing? Stefania is giving up
her right to speak.

41:52.416 --> 41:54.458
Why doesn't she even try? But…

41:54.541 --> 41:56.458
What kind of game is it
if they don't play?

41:56.541 --> 41:59.708
-Don't worry, Mommy. It's okay.
-I'm just sorry for Giggi, darling.

41:59.791 --> 42:01.708
And now the orchestra

42:01.791 --> 42:04.291
will reveal the missing word
for round one.

42:04.375 --> 42:05.833
But there's one girl

42:07.541 --> 42:10.333
Who's bathing in

42:11.125 --> 42:14.458
The moonlight

42:14.541 --> 42:16.750
The moonlight, ladies and gentlemen!

42:16.833 --> 42:18.708
The moonlight!

42:35.625 --> 42:36.958
Rosa?

42:37.541 --> 42:38.458
Rosa!

42:39.333 --> 42:41.166
A friend of yours came to see you.

42:41.250 --> 42:43.083
Please, come in. Something to drink?

42:43.166 --> 42:44.500
No, thanks.

42:44.583 --> 42:47.541
Come in! Are you sure you don't want
something to drink?

42:47.625 --> 42:49.291
-No.
-Hi, dear.

43:01.541 --> 43:02.833
What are you doing here?

43:04.541 --> 43:06.208
-They have to know.
-Now? Like this?

43:06.291 --> 43:07.250
Now. Like this.

43:07.333 --> 43:09.375
And who is this nice young woman?

43:16.041 --> 43:17.333
I'm your daughter.

43:26.250 --> 43:27.708
Is that a joke?

43:31.791 --> 43:33.250
It's not a joke, Dad.

43:33.875 --> 43:35.208
This is our Adele.

43:35.291 --> 43:36.416
Nora.

43:37.000 --> 43:38.208
Mom?

43:39.666 --> 43:43.458
I'm sorry, darling, but didn't you say
you were friends from university?

43:44.750 --> 43:45.583
No.

43:46.166 --> 43:48.250
Listen, I can tell you everything I know.

43:50.375 --> 43:52.000
But my father can never find out.

43:52.083 --> 43:55.500
Your father? Didn't you just say
I was your father, seconds ago?

43:55.583 --> 43:58.583
No. My father's name is Antonio.
We're carnies at the Luna Park.

43:58.666 --> 44:00.458
Carnies! Of course!

44:01.041 --> 44:02.416
I'm sorry. I don't understand.

44:02.500 --> 44:05.291
How can this girl be our daughter

44:05.375 --> 44:08.250
if she has a father
whose name's Antonio and he's a carny?

44:08.333 --> 44:10.625
Don't you get it, my love?

44:11.208 --> 44:13.208
They're lowlifes, after my money.

44:13.291 --> 44:16.208
How much do you want
to put an end to this charade?

44:16.291 --> 44:17.750
I don't want your money.

44:17.833 --> 44:18.833
You only take checks?

44:20.750 --> 44:21.708
Dad, stop it!

44:22.291 --> 44:23.708
Show him your back.

44:24.833 --> 44:25.791
Please.

44:33.375 --> 44:34.333
See?

44:34.416 --> 44:37.541
Under the tattoo, there's Adele's
butterfly-shaped birthmark.

44:37.625 --> 44:38.708
Of course!

44:38.791 --> 44:41.166
The birthmark's covered by a tattoo.
How convenient.

44:41.250 --> 44:43.791
How long have you been manipulating
our daughter?

44:43.875 --> 44:46.875
No, wait. Let's hear what she has to say.

44:46.958 --> 44:49.208
If there was even the slightest chance--

44:49.291 --> 44:52.500
This is a scam. We will not
be conned in our own house.

44:52.583 --> 44:53.833
This is ridiculous.

44:53.916 --> 44:56.708
See how stubborn you are?
You two are the same!

44:56.791 --> 44:58.333
-Who?
-You and her.

44:58.416 --> 45:01.000
Really? So it's you and her now?

45:01.083 --> 45:03.750
Well, you know what?
I'm even more stubborn than her!

45:03.833 --> 45:05.750
And this farce ends here!

45:06.250 --> 45:08.875
Why do you think it's a scam, Dad?
Will you tell me?

45:08.958 --> 45:10.166
I said, enough!

45:10.750 --> 45:12.541
Whoever is behind this sham
is going to pay.

45:12.625 --> 45:15.333
Tullio! Tullio, where are you going?

45:15.416 --> 45:17.375
-Where is he going?
-I don't know.

45:17.458 --> 45:19.708
-But you can stay. Maybe we can talk--
-Wait!

45:43.291 --> 45:46.291
