01:28.421 --> 01:30.156
You guys are good.

01:32.759 --> 01:34.828
Balki, you always do "Bambi."

01:37.731 --> 01:39.399
Boy, when the four of us
get together

01:39.432 --> 01:41.101
we sure do have fun, don't we?

01:42.468 --> 01:44.805
Speaking of the four of us
being together

01:44.838 --> 01:47.407
Jennifer has something
she's been wanting to tell you.

01:48.341 --> 01:50.544
Uh, um, maybe later.

01:50.577 --> 01:53.179
Now, come on. What is it?

01:53.213 --> 01:56.650
Well, the airline
is giving me a promotion.

01:56.683 --> 01:57.884
[gasps]
Oh!

01:57.918 --> 01:59.920
‐ Oh, that's great!
‐ That's wonderful.

01:59.953 --> 02:02.222
And I'm moving to Los Angeles.

02:02.255 --> 02:03.690
Oh!

02:06.627 --> 02:07.928
Oh.

02:07.961 --> 02:09.663
What do you think
about that, Larry?

02:10.663 --> 02:12.899
Los Angeles. That's great.

02:14.501 --> 02:15.836
A promotion.

02:16.937 --> 02:18.371
In Los Angeles.

02:19.906 --> 02:21.407
Mary Anne.

02:21.441 --> 02:23.910
Are you going
to Los Angeles too?

02:23.944 --> 02:26.179
Oh, no, I have allergies.

02:27.413 --> 02:28.682
So, uh, ahem...

02:30.383 --> 02:32.953
Jennifer, when are you moving?

02:32.986 --> 02:35.488
I haven't given them
a definite yes.

02:35.522 --> 02:37.290
I mean, It's a good career move

02:37.323 --> 02:38.659
and it's more money

02:38.692 --> 02:40.527
and the weather is great

02:40.561 --> 02:43.296
but Chicago is my home.

02:43.329 --> 02:44.698
What do you think
about that, Larry?

02:49.736 --> 02:51.271
What do I think?

02:51.304 --> 02:52.372
Yeah, I mean, she has a point.

02:52.405 --> 02:54.240
It's a good career move...

02:54.908 --> 02:56.777
...more money.

02:56.810 --> 02:58.579
Well, weather is great.

02:59.713 --> 03:02.282
I mean, maybe she should
go for it.

03:02.315 --> 03:03.416
Uh, you know what they say

I was so indecisive.

a good career move

03:13.660 --> 03:15.529

03:16.830 --> 03:18.832
Well, what's keeping me here?

03:23.436 --> 03:24.437
Nothing.

03:26.673 --> 03:28.809
Let's go, Mary Anne,
it's late.

03:28.842 --> 03:31.011
Thanks for
the wonderful evening.

03:31.044 --> 03:32.679

03:45.325 --> 03:48.428
The woman of your dreams

03:57.303 --> 03:58.905
Alright, what
was I supposed to say?

04:00.006 --> 04:02.275
She obviously has
her plans made

04:02.308 --> 04:04.545
and‐and I'm not part of them.

04:04.578 --> 04:07.981

that made Mypos great.

04:14.655 --> 04:16.690
There are none so blind

04:16.723 --> 04:18.659
as those who will not hear.

04:22.428 --> 04:24.330
Cousin, you‐you've
gotta go up to her

04:24.364 --> 04:26.032
and tell her you will die
a thousand deaths

04:26.066 --> 04:27.067
if she go to California.

04:27.100 --> 04:29.302
Not a chance.

04:29.335 --> 04:30.737
If I went out there
and told her how I felt

04:30.771 --> 04:32.773
she'd laugh in my face.

04:32.806 --> 04:36.409
But, cousin,
if‐if you don't‐don't tell her

04:36.442 --> 04:38.579
you'll regret it
for the rest of your life.

04:39.913 --> 04:41.047
Forget it, Balki.

How was your day?

06:08.602 --> 06:11.838
Well, I bought two
more shopping malls

06:11.872 --> 06:13.840
and a hotel.

06:13.874 --> 06:16.409
Oh, Balki, I thought we agreed
we had enough hotels.

06:16.442 --> 06:18.044
Well, I know,
but this one

06:18.078 --> 06:20.046
got a revolving door and...

06:20.080 --> 06:22.783
...you know how much
I love revolving doors.

06:24.217 --> 06:26.787
Oh, Balki.
You'll never grow up.

I certainly hope not.

Come in, Cousin Larry.

06:55.682 --> 06:57.417
Hope I'm not
interrupting anything.

06:58.785 --> 07:00.821
I brought the rent check.

07:00.854 --> 07:03.957
I'm afraid I'm a little short
this month.

07:03.990 --> 07:05.726
Larry, we've told you
every month.

07:05.759 --> 07:07.127
You don't have to pay rent.

07:07.160 --> 07:08.762
Balki owns the building.

07:08.795 --> 07:09.730
I know, I know

07:09.763 --> 07:12.699
but an Appleton
likes to pay his own way.

07:13.767 --> 07:15.602
I'll‐I'll make it up next month.

07:16.770 --> 07:18.038
How much am I behind?

07:18.071 --> 07:19.973
Oh, cousin, I have no idea.

07:20.006 --> 07:21.808
No, really I want to know.

07:21.842 --> 07:23.544
I‐it's absolutely nothing.

07:23.577 --> 07:25.546
‐ I insist.
‐ Cousin, it's a pittance.

07:25.579 --> 07:27.681
Balki, how much do I owe you?

07:27.714 --> 07:30.050
Thirty five thousand dollars.

I'm gonna hit the lottery.

07:37.924 --> 07:40.460
Well, of course you are,
don't be absurd.

07:48.134 --> 07:50.971
Is that pig snout I smell?

07:51.004 --> 07:54.040
I haven't had a good pig snout
dinner since, uh...

07:54.074 --> 07:55.041
...since, uh...

07:55.075 --> 07:56.476

to join us.

I dropped by.

08:13.126 --> 08:15.862

08:32.679 --> 08:34.179

Always have.

08:40.754 --> 08:43.724
You'll never guess who I got
a letter from today.

08:43.756 --> 08:45.258
'I got a letter from Jennifer.'

08:48.629 --> 08:49.663
Jennifer?

08:49.696 --> 08:52.533
I don't remember any Jennifer.

08:53.967 --> 08:56.302
Remember you, you let her
go to Los Angeles

08:56.336 --> 08:57.804
and it ruined your life.

09:00.674 --> 09:01.942
No, can't place her.

09:09.750 --> 09:11.752
In her letter she said
she's getting a divorce.

09:11.785 --> 09:14.254
I think he's
a Yugoslavian prince.

09:14.287 --> 09:15.922
Are you sure
it's not the astronaut?

09:15.956 --> 09:19.626
No, no, no, the prince
was her second husband.

09:19.660 --> 09:22.262
He came between the Texas oil
man and the astronauts.

09:22.295 --> 09:24.798
She's divorcing
her fourth husband.

09:24.831 --> 09:28.034
I don't know what he does
but I think he owns Asia.

09:32.305 --> 09:35.241
If it's the same Jennifer
I'm thinking about.

09:37.043 --> 09:39.379
Well, if it is the Jennifer
you're thinking about

09:39.412 --> 09:41.281
she'll be in town tomorrow
and she's stopping

09:41.314 --> 09:43.183
by here for a visit.

09:43.216 --> 09:45.619
Isn't that
magnificent, cousin?

09:45.652 --> 09:47.253
Finally, after all these years

09:47.287 --> 09:49.890
you'll be able to see
Jennifer face to face.

Jennifer's here, we've been
waiting for you for 20 minutes.

10:35.368 --> 10:38.872
That makes you a bit more
than fashionably late.

10:41.174 --> 10:43.209
I started dressing
three hours ago

10:43.243 --> 10:45.912
but I can't help but feel...

10:45.946 --> 10:47.681
...something's missing.

10:54.287 --> 10:56.022
Your pants, perhaps, hmm?

10:57.157 --> 10:59.159
Oh, oh.

11:00.460 --> 11:02.295
Cousin, you know...

11:02.328 --> 11:04.197
...I haven't seen you
dressed in a necktie

11:04.230 --> 11:05.298
in quite a while.

11:05.331 --> 11:07.133
You cut a fine figure.

11:10.436 --> 11:11.471
You mean it?

11:11.505 --> 11:12.839
Would I lie to you?

11:18.044 --> 11:19.980
Cousin, come along,
let's go and see Jennifer.

11:20.013 --> 11:23.249
Oh, Balki, what's the point?

11:24.050 --> 11:25.919
Any feelings...

11:30.991 --> 11:33.760
Any feelings
I had for Jennifer are...

11:33.794 --> 11:34.895
...dead and buried.

11:39.299 --> 11:40.767
Well, from the looks
of your apartment

11:40.801 --> 11:42.035
it's a shallow grave.

11:44.505 --> 11:47.007
Well, maybe I still feel
something for Jennifer.

11:47.040 --> 11:48.341
So what?

11:48.374 --> 11:49.876
So tell her, man

11:49.910 --> 11:51.745
as you ought to have done
40 years ago.

11:51.778 --> 11:53.146
It's too late.

11:53.179 --> 11:55.148
Ah! It's never too late.

11:55.181 --> 11:57.317
It's over. It's done.

11:57.350 --> 11:59.820
It's yesterday's potatoes.

11:59.853 --> 12:02.155

12:03.289 --> 12:05.091

12:05.125 --> 12:07.360
Yeah, it's easy
for you to say.

12:09.495 --> 12:12.232
But for me,
the ship has sailed.

12:14.034 --> 12:16.770
[speaking gibberish]

12:29.516 --> 12:31.351
She said she'd love
to see you again.

12:33.153 --> 12:34.320
She did?

12:34.354 --> 12:35.321
Yes, she did.

12:36.857 --> 12:39.292
Well, I would like
to see her again.

12:39.325 --> 12:41.261
See how she's changed.

12:41.294 --> 12:43.564
See if the years
have treated her well.

12:43.597 --> 12:46.399
We could talk about
all the things she's done.

12:46.432 --> 12:49.069
All the things I...haven't done.

12:50.504 --> 12:52.405
Cousin, think of it, man.

12:52.438 --> 12:54.174
There was a spark there once.

12:54.207 --> 12:57.377
Perhaps you can fan it
into a flame again.

12:57.410 --> 12:58.545
You think so?

12:58.579 --> 13:01.114
Fan it, man. Fan it.

14:03.644 --> 14:05.078
I'm an old man.

14:05.111 --> 14:06.647
Well, cousin, we're all old.

14:06.680 --> 14:10.250
And, listen, if we didn't get
older, we'd be dead.

14:15.388 --> 14:17.457
Oh, you're here.

14:17.490 --> 14:18.892
And you look so...

14:19.660 --> 14:20.861
...clean.

14:23.163 --> 14:25.398
Jennifer's a little nervous
about seeing you.

14:26.499 --> 14:29.035
Maybe she's not as cute
as she used to be.

14:31.137 --> 14:32.539
Here's Jennifer, Larry.

14:45.285 --> 14:46.452
Hi, Larry.

14:48.121 --> 14:50.691
Jennifer, you haven't
changed a bit.

14:50.724 --> 14:51.792
Well...

14:51.825 --> 14:54.961
No, I mean you really haven't
changed a bit.

14:54.995 --> 14:56.663
I mean nothing.

14:57.463 --> 14:58.999
Not anything.

14:59.566 --> 15:01.568
You're gorgeous.

15:08.141 --> 15:09.576
Try to show a little dignity.

15:11.477 --> 15:13.279
Why don't we all sit down?

15:28.328 --> 15:30.964
Well, here we all are...

15:30.997 --> 15:31.965
...together again.

15:31.998 --> 15:33.700
The four musketeers.

15:34.568 --> 15:36.069
Friends till the end.

15:36.102 --> 15:37.103
That's right.

15:37.671 --> 15:39.372
Well...

15:39.405 --> 15:40.507
We got to go.

15:41.642 --> 15:43.443
No... What‐what
do you mean go?

15:43.476 --> 15:44.511
Where‐where are you going?

15:44.545 --> 15:46.012
I just got here.

15:46.046 --> 15:47.380
Ever since Balki
bought the cubs

15:47.413 --> 15:49.449
he likes to throw out
the first ball.

15:49.482 --> 15:51.084
Of every game.

15:51.685 --> 15:53.219
Baseball fever.

15:53.253 --> 15:55.556
I caught it,
and I bought it.

15:57.524 --> 15:58.992
Balki. Balki.

16:01.294 --> 16:03.496
You can't leave me alone
with Jennifer.

16:03.530 --> 16:07.167
But, cousin, this is your chance
to reveal to her how you feel.

16:07.200 --> 16:08.101
I‐i‐it..

16:08.134 --> 16:10.671
The sounds you hear
is opportunity knocking.

16:10.704 --> 16:12.405
‐ So you ju‐just walk right‐‐
‐ Balki?

16:12.438 --> 16:13.740
We should be going
we're going to be late.

16:13.774 --> 16:15.609
Darling, thank you.
You just walk right across‐‐

16:15.642 --> 16:17.177
Balki, honey,
let them both speak.

16:17.210 --> 16:19.245
Darling, we're‐we're not
going to be late.

16:19.279 --> 16:20.514
‐ You just walk right across‐‐
‐ Balki.

16:20.547 --> 16:22.048
Darling, I'm involved.

16:26.186 --> 16:27.521
Alright. Let's go.

16:29.222 --> 16:30.290
See you later.

16:48.609 --> 16:51.144
‐ Uh, Larry, I meant to‐‐
‐ Jennifer, I‐‐

16:51.177 --> 16:53.046
‐ Uh, go ahead.
‐ No, you go on.

16:53.079 --> 16:54.414
No, ladies first.

16:54.447 --> 16:56.683
Well, what‐what
were you gonna say?

16:56.717 --> 16:58.018
‐ I have to go.
‐ Huh?

16:59.452 --> 17:02.088
I don't have much time,
I have a plane to catch.

17:02.122 --> 17:04.758
Jennifer don't go
to Los Angeles!

17:04.790 --> 17:07.761
I'm not going to Los Angeles.
I'm going to Monte Carlo.

17:07.794 --> 17:11.364
No, no, it's what I should
have said 40 years ago

17:11.396 --> 17:13.398
when you had
that job opportunity

17:13.433 --> 17:14.768
in California.

17:14.800 --> 17:17.470
I wanted you to stay
in Chicago with me.

17:18.304 --> 17:20.240
I liked you a lot then.

17:21.473 --> 17:22.643
I like you a lot now.

17:22.675 --> 17:25.546
I'll probably always
like you a lot.

17:26.412 --> 17:28.414
I like you a lot too, Larry.

17:31.384 --> 17:32.586
You do?

17:33.486 --> 17:35.522
You like me?

17:35.556 --> 17:37.624
That's wonderful.

17:37.658 --> 17:40.226
We can build a life together.

17:40.260 --> 17:41.528
We'll start over.

17:41.562 --> 17:43.463
Let's have lots of kids.

17:45.566 --> 17:46.767
Where do you want to live?

17:46.800 --> 17:48.835
I like Chicago
but California's

17:48.869 --> 17:51.505
probably better
for my rheumatism.

17:51.538 --> 17:53.707
Little thing here.
Oh, what the heck!

17:53.740 --> 17:55.742
It doesn't matter where we are

17:55.776 --> 17:58.779
as long as we're together.

17:58.812 --> 18:02.716
Oh, gosh, Jennifer.
I feel 60 again.

18:06.452 --> 18:09.355
Well, Larry, we live
in different worlds now.

18:09.389 --> 18:11.658
I mean, mine is a world
of fancy parties

18:11.692 --> 18:15.195
lunch at the Polo Lounge,
dinner at Maxim's.

18:15.228 --> 18:17.497
The cholesterol alone
would kill you.

18:18.799 --> 18:20.667
Wh‐where are you going?

18:20.701 --> 18:23.369
To the airport, that's where
they keep the planes.

18:23.403 --> 18:25.706
Please, don't go.

18:25.739 --> 18:28.542
If only you'd
said something 40 years ago

18:28.575 --> 18:30.210
things might
have been different.

18:31.945 --> 18:33.413
I understand.

18:35.949 --> 18:37.417
Goodbye, Jennifer.

18:44.357 --> 18:45.559
Goodbye, Larry.

18:47.561 --> 18:48.895
No, don't go!

18:50.864 --> 18:54.234
Don't leave me!
Don't leave me!

18:55.602 --> 18:57.470
Don't leave me.

18:57.504 --> 18:58.772
Don't leave me!

18:58.805 --> 19:00.707
Oh, what... What...

19:01.808 --> 19:03.744
[screaming]

19:12.385 --> 19:13.920
Yes! Yes! Yes!

19:13.954 --> 19:17.558
Hello, you wonderful
old Myposian artifacts!

19:20.727 --> 19:23.263
Ah‐hah!
I have hair! I have hair!

19:23.296 --> 19:24.364
Lots of hair.

19:27.901 --> 19:29.603
Mom!

19:35.876 --> 19:38.178
You have no mustache!

19:49.723 --> 19:51.191
Zuzu's petals!

19:58.431 --> 20:00.333
It's not too late.

20:05.706 --> 20:07.674
Must be an antacid flashback.

20:09.743 --> 20:11.578
[knock on door]

20:14.581 --> 20:15.549
Who is it?

20:15.582 --> 20:17.718
[Larry]
It's Larry, Jennifer.

20:19.019 --> 20:21.522
‐ Larry, what's wrong?
‐ Jennifer, don't go.

20:21.555 --> 20:23.389
‐ What?
‐ Don't go to Los Angeles.

20:23.423 --> 20:24.457
You don't want me to go?

20:24.490 --> 20:26.492
No. No.

20:26.527 --> 20:27.828
I'm not too late again am I?

20:27.861 --> 20:30.564
You‐you can change your mind?
Can't you?

20:30.597 --> 20:34.434
Jennifer... I really like you.

20:34.467 --> 20:36.937
I don't think
I've liked anybody as much.

20:36.970 --> 20:38.739
Oh, Larry,
when you didn't say anything

20:38.772 --> 20:39.873
I thought that you didn't feel

20:39.906 --> 20:42.008
about me the way
I feel about you.

20:43.710 --> 20:45.712
Well, how do you feel about me?

20:45.746 --> 20:47.814
I like you, Larry.

20:47.848 --> 20:49.015
As long as you like me.

20:50.316 --> 20:52.318
I do, I do, I like you.

20:53.319 --> 20:54.555
And I want you to stay.

20:55.488 --> 20:57.691
I want to stay here too.

20:57.724 --> 20:59.660
‐ You do?
‐ I do.

20:59.693 --> 21:02.428
So... you'll stay?

21:03.329 --> 21:05.599
I'll stay.

21:05.632 --> 21:06.800
You won't be sorry.

21:06.833 --> 21:08.434
We'll have fun.

21:08.468 --> 21:09.736
I'll do nice things for you.

21:12.706 --> 21:13.807
Do you want a pizza?

21:16.877 --> 21:19.412
Larry, it's three o'clock
in the morning.

21:21.114 --> 21:22.683
Right.

21:22.716 --> 21:24.585
Yes, I got you up.

21:24.618 --> 21:27.053
I‐I‐I'll go back downstairs

21:27.087 --> 21:28.955
'cause, and I just‐I just, I...

21:28.989 --> 21:30.390
Do you still like me?

21:39.900 --> 21:41.568
Does that answer
your question?

21:53.146 --> 21:54.548
I guess it does.

22:00.887 --> 22:03.557
Well, I‐I‐I should be going.

22:05.892 --> 22:06.993
Shouldn't I?

22:09.996 --> 22:11.698
‐ I‐I think so.
‐ Yeah, I know.

22:11.732 --> 22:12.799
I thought I should.

22:14.568 --> 22:16.036
Goodnight.

22:18.404 --> 22:19.773
[Larry
Whoa! Whoa!

22:21.942 --> 22:23.844
[thud]

22:23.877 --> 22:26.412
I'm fine! I'm fine!

22:33.520 --> 22:35.055
Balki.

22:35.088 --> 22:36.757
You'll never guess
what happened.

22:36.790 --> 22:38.058
You fell down the stairs.

22:39.760 --> 22:42.529
Well, yes,
but that's not important.

22:42.563 --> 22:44.665
Jennifer's not going
to Los Angeles.

22:44.698 --> 22:47.568
She likes me,
she really likes me.

22:47.601 --> 22:49.836
Cousin, you're starting
to sound like Sally Field

22:49.870 --> 22:51.104
at the academy awards.

22:52.639 --> 22:53.874
I can't help it.

22:53.907 --> 22:56.577
I'm so happy and I owe
it all to you, Balki.

22:56.610 --> 22:57.778
You're the one
who told me to go upstairs

22:57.811 --> 22:58.779
and tell her how I feel.

22:58.812 --> 23:02.549
Well, I like to call them
like I call them.

23:04.150 --> 23:06.720
You know, I have always
let opportunities

23:06.753 --> 23:07.621
slip through my fingers

23:07.654 --> 23:09.455
because I've been
afraid to take chances.

23:09.489 --> 23:11.491
Well, I learned
a lesson tonight.

23:11.525 --> 23:12.759
Yes, you did.

23:12.793 --> 23:14.595
You took the bull by the horns

23:14.628 --> 23:17.598
and you stepped in
something good.

23:20.567 --> 23:21.535
Balki...

23:22.769 --> 23:25.772
...I feel, like,
I'm on top of the world.

23:25.806 --> 23:28.875
I feel, like,
I could do anything.

23:28.909 --> 23:29.943
I feel...

23:31.745 --> 23:33.947
I feel like
I broke my leg.

23:33.980 --> 23:36.917
[instrumental music]

23:43.990 --> 23:46.627
[theme music]
