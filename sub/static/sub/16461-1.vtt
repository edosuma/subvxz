and you wash it

03:39.969 --> 03:43.805

06:09.952 --> 06:11.244
Didn't I teach you?

Uh, no.
That's all gonna have to end, Skunk.

13:27.139 --> 13:28.306
Really?

13:28.516 --> 13:31.810
Well, you see, the relationship
between student and teacher

13:32.686 --> 13:34.729
- is by its nature...
- (Jed) You won't be our teacher.

13:34.855 --> 13:36.397
- Well, you never know, Jed.
- Mike.

13:36.524 --> 13:38.566
- By nature is what?
- Well, it's adversarial.

13:38.901 --> 13:40.151
- What does that mean?
- (whispers) Go.

13:40.236 --> 13:43.738
Well, it means that it'll be my job
to see you as the enemy.

13:43.823 --> 13:46.574
- He's full of shit.
- Somebody only worthy of my contempt.

13:46.659 --> 13:47.992

- No, I'm not!

13:58.003 --> 13:59.212
(Mike) Guys, guys.

13:59.255 --> 14:02.423
ln my experience, the person
who brings up the subject of love

14:02.508 --> 14:05.677
is more often than not
the person who is in love.

14:05.761 --> 14:07.095
- Really?
- Shut up.

14:07.221 --> 14:09.180

14:09.265 --> 14:11.766
What about you two? Are you in love?

14:11.934 --> 14:13.768
Mike and I? Of course.

14:13.936 --> 14:15.937
Then why aren't you married yet?

Close your curtains.

14:42.381 --> 14:44.299
(Archie) Have you called Dr Curtis?

14:44.425 --> 14:47.760
Oh, yes, but he says, uh,
he can't act in any way

14:47.803 --> 14:50.221
without Rick's permission.

14:50.764 --> 14:52.640
- Which he won't give.
- This is what I'm saying.

14:52.766 --> 14:54.434
He won't come out of his bedroom, Archie.

14:56.145 --> 14:57.812
(Mr Buckley)
Janet sits outside his door all day

14:57.897 --> 14:59.772

15:05.821 --> 15:09.324
(sighs) I'm sorry to drop in on you
like this, out of the blue,

15:09.408 --> 15:11.117
but I just...
You know, I just thought...

15:11.160 --> 15:13.828
I thought, "Well, Archie, he's a...
a solicitor and..."

15:13.954 --> 15:16.664
So you want...
you want to take this matter further?

15:16.790 --> 15:19.292
You want to make this a legal matter?

15:19.335 --> 15:21.753
Bloody legal action?
No, no, no. Forget it. Uh...

15:21.837 --> 15:23.671
I don't want anything more
to do with the bastard.

15:24.173 --> 15:26.174
- Oswald?
- Yes.

15:26.675 --> 15:27.842
Why not?

15:29.011 --> 15:31.012
Because I'm scared of him.

15:32.181 --> 15:34.265
I'm just really bloody scared of him.

15:35.476 --> 15:38.686
(Mrs Buckley) And you went under the water.

15:38.938 --> 15:40.313
Five years old.

15:42.191 --> 15:47.111
And your father ran so fast
across those stones to get you.

15:47.947 --> 15:49.280
And he got you.

15:50.866 --> 15:52.617
He saved you.

15:57.665 --> 15:59.207
- And then...
- (doorbell chiming)

16:13.180 --> 16:16.808
Hello, Mrs Buckley. ls Rick in?

16:17.059 --> 16:18.476
Why?

16:18.727 --> 16:20.186
Don't know.

16:20.604 --> 16:22.522
Just thought he might like
to hang out or something.

16:22.606 --> 16:25.233
He's ill, love. He can't come out.

16:25.818 --> 16:27.443
Oh...

16:27.611 --> 16:29.946
- Okay, well...
- Goodbye now, love.

16:30.614 --> 16:31.614
Bye.

16:34.660 --> 16:36.077
(door closes)

16:42.209 --> 16:43.710
(keys jangling)

16:48.924 --> 16:50.717
(footsteps approaching)

16:51.760 --> 16:53.511
(Mrs Buckley) And anyway...

16:55.055 --> 16:58.599
Then we bought you that Matchbox tank.

16:59.935 --> 17:01.644
Do you remember?
For being so brave.

17:02.104 --> 17:05.147
And you tried to give it to your dad

17:05.482 --> 17:07.817
because he'd cut his feet up

17:08.109 --> 17:10.737
running over those stones.

17:10.988 --> 17:13.698
So kind, you were, so...

17:18.954 --> 17:22.373
I mean, what five-year-old in the world...

17:24.334 --> 17:26.419
would have done that, huh?

17:37.014 --> 17:38.639
Um...

17:42.895 --> 17:45.646
(mumbling) Stupid.

17:56.825 --> 17:58.618
- Hello, Archie.
- Bob.

17:58.702 --> 18:00.536
What can I do for you?

18:01.288 --> 18:04.207
I was wondering if we could have a little chat.

18:04.416 --> 18:05.541
- Chat?
- Yeah.

18:05.626 --> 18:07.126
Yeah, absolutely.

18:11.882 --> 18:14.383
Okay, well, um...

18:16.220 --> 18:21.432
I know things have been... tough for you
since Barbara passed away, you know?

18:21.517 --> 18:24.102
For you and for the girls, you know?
And what with...

18:24.186 --> 18:26.437
everything that's been happening lately...

18:26.522 --> 18:30.149
I just... I wanted you to know that,
you know, if ever you wanted to talk...

18:30.234 --> 18:31.359
- Talk?
- Yeah.

18:31.443 --> 18:32.777
Fuck off, Archie, will you?

18:37.866 --> 18:38.991
All right. Um...

18:39.660 --> 18:43.788
Well, what I wanted to ask you was, uh...

18:43.914 --> 18:49.210
if you could ask your girls
to give the Buckleys a break.

18:50.337 --> 18:51.879
They've been having a tough time of it lately.

18:51.964 --> 18:53.047
- Have they?
- Yeah.

18:53.340 --> 18:55.925
That's really awful. (sniffs)

19:01.431 --> 19:03.641
When was the last time you cried, Archie?

19:04.977 --> 19:06.185
- Cried?
- Yeah.

19:06.562 --> 19:08.646
- I don't know. Why?
- 'Cause the next time you will

19:08.730 --> 19:11.232
is the next time that you criticise my girls... 
No, hang on.

19:11.316 --> 19:13.734
...in any fucking way whatsoever, all right?

19:13.819 --> 19:15.319
They're out of bounds.

19:15.863 --> 19:18.573
And if Buckley can't take
a little friendly fucking ribbing,

19:18.657 --> 19:21.909
then he's more of a pathetic prick
than I thought he was.

19:21.994 --> 19:24.036
Now, I'm having my dinner, mate,
so if you don't mind fucking off.

19:24.121 --> 19:26.205
Thanks.

19:37.634 --> 19:39.051
(Jed)
You know what'd make it better?

19:39.136 --> 19:40.344
A Blu-ray player.

19:40.429 --> 19:41.637
Yeah, well, you can't have everything, Jed.

19:41.722 --> 19:43.055
No, I'm just saying.

19:43.140 --> 19:45.600
I got you that ashtray, didn't I?

19:45.851 --> 19:47.852
That's what I'm saying, Skunk.
lt's brilliant.

19:48.061 --> 19:49.937
lt's the best ever.

19:52.900 --> 19:55.610
- Be great if we never had to go back.
- What, to school?

19:55.694 --> 19:56.819
Yeah.

19:56.904 --> 19:59.655
I don't know. I'm kind of
looking forward to going, actually.

19:59.740 --> 20:02.074
Oh, first year.

20:02.159 --> 20:03.159
What?

20:03.243 --> 20:04.911
Sometimes when you're walking
down the corridors,

20:04.995 --> 20:06.787
- the older kids will punch you.
- What?

20:06.872 --> 20:08.080
ln the stomach.

20:08.165 --> 20:09.248
(Skunk shrieks)

20:09.333 --> 20:10.333
(Dillon) ldiots!

20:10.417 --> 20:12.001
- Watch where you're going, will you?
- (Jed) Listen, mate,

20:12.127 --> 20:13.920
it's not our fault you can't ride your bike.

20:14.004 --> 20:17.840
lt's not my bike.
And I can ride it. Watch this.

20:17.925 --> 20:19.175
Whose is it, then?

20:20.260 --> 20:22.470
- That is a travesty.
- (Dillon) Hang on, hang on.

20:22.554 --> 20:24.138
Right, you ready?

20:25.557 --> 20:26.891
(laughs)

20:26.975 --> 20:28.684
Hey! You thieving little spastic!

20:28.769 --> 20:29.769
I'll kill you!

20:29.853 --> 20:32.355
I'll kill you! I'll bloody kill you!

20:33.857 --> 20:35.149
Twats!

20:36.652 --> 20:38.194
- Yes!
- What the fucking hell?

20:40.948 --> 20:43.908
Fucking hell! (gags)

20:51.124 --> 20:52.833
So who do you live with, then?

20:53.043 --> 20:54.460
My auntie.

20:54.544 --> 20:57.046
- Where's your dad?
- He's dead.

20:57.673 --> 20:59.173
Dead?

20:59.591 --> 21:02.802
He was killed in a fire, along with my mum.

21:02.886 --> 21:05.763
- That's terrible.
- And my sister.

21:09.810 --> 21:13.020
I don't give a shit.
I was only five or six at the time.

21:13.355 --> 21:14.939
(Skunk) Oh.

21:15.440 --> 21:17.441
(Jed) Wow. Cool.

21:20.570 --> 21:23.698
Our mum ran away
with an accountant from Birmingham.

21:23.782 --> 21:26.951
Yeah? So are you a lesbian?

21:27.077 --> 21:28.536
No.

21:28.620 --> 21:30.037
You look like a lesbian.

21:30.122 --> 21:32.123
What does a lesbian look like?

21:34.084 --> 21:35.668
Kind of ugly.

21:35.877 --> 21:37.086
(Jed) Oi, Skunk!

21:38.839 --> 21:40.631
(Mrs Buckley) No, but just stop them taking him.

21:40.716 --> 21:42.216
Dave, why don't you
just go in there and do something?

21:42.301 --> 21:44.635
- (Mr Buckley) Calm down. I'm really...
- Sort it out, for Christ's sake.

21:44.720 --> 21:46.178
(Sunrise) He's coming!

21:46.305 --> 21:48.180
(Mrs Buckley) Rick, Rick.
You've done nothing wrong, Rick.

21:48.348 --> 21:49.974
Here he is.

21:50.058 --> 21:51.934
(Saskia) Get the straitjacket.
(Mrs Buckley) Stop it!

21:52.019 --> 21:54.770
(Sunrise) Lock him up!
(Mrs Buckley) Rick! Rick! I love you.

21:54.855 --> 21:56.856
Put him in a padded fucking cell, the psycho.

21:57.607 --> 21:59.025
(Sunrise)
Cut his knob off.

22:00.444 --> 22:01.986
(Saskia)
Feed it to him.

22:02.070 --> 22:04.030
(Sunrise)
His donkey fucking knob!

22:04.281 --> 22:05.906
Hee-haw, hee-haw!

22:06.616 --> 22:08.117
(Saskia laughs)

22:08.410 --> 22:09.994
(Kasia)
Jed.

22:11.371 --> 22:13.497
(Jed) Has Rick gone mental?
(Kasia) Shut up and go inside.

22:13.582 --> 22:14.999
Where are you going?

22:15.083 --> 22:16.959
(Jed) He's coming in to play Xbox.
(Kasia) No, he's not.

22:17.044 --> 22:19.420
Bye-bye.
Off you go back to your halting site.

22:19.629 --> 22:22.214
(Dillon) I ain't no pikey.
(Jed) That's racist, Kasia.

22:22.424 --> 22:24.383
- Sorry, mate. She's Polish.
- (Kasia) Skunk!

22:31.892 --> 22:34.143
- Bye.
- You don't look like a lesbian.

22:34.353 --> 22:36.354
No? So why'd you say I did, then?

22:37.439 --> 22:39.565
- I don't know.
- Because I'm ugly?

22:39.649 --> 22:40.649
No, you're not.

22:41.401 --> 22:43.027
You're really pretty.

22:44.654 --> 22:47.406
- Am I?
- (laughs) No. You're ugly.

22:47.949 --> 22:49.241
(Dillon) See ya.

22:49.576 --> 22:51.619
(Mr Buckley) Well, sitting outside his
bedroom door all day's not gonna help.

22:51.703 --> 22:52.787
lt's that kind of babying...

22:52.871 --> 22:53.996
- (Mrs Buckley) Babying?
- Yes.

22:54.081 --> 22:56.540
You don't know whether you're coming
or going. Look at yourself.

22:56.625 --> 22:58.626
When did you last have a shower?

22:59.461 --> 23:01.879
- Our son is sick.
- Give him a break.

23:01.963 --> 23:05.132
- Our son needs to know I'm here!
- Calm down... Well, I'll...

23:05.217 --> 23:07.051
Please, don't. Please, don't.

23:07.135 --> 23:09.053
(Mr Buckley)
Rick, get out of this room!

23:09.137 --> 23:11.305
Rick, open this door.
lf you don't open this door...

23:11.390 --> 23:13.724
I'm... Rick, I'm coming in, you...

23:14.768 --> 23:15.893
- (tearing)
- Ah!

23:25.779 --> 23:27.446
(Mr Buckley)
I asked the doctor they had there

23:28.031 --> 23:30.449
how long they could keep him in, and, uh...

23:31.576 --> 23:33.953
he said, indefinitely.

23:34.496 --> 23:36.872
- Right.
- ls that true?

23:38.375 --> 23:39.625
Well, um...

23:41.044 --> 23:43.879
lf a patient's been sectioned,

23:43.964 --> 23:48.968
they have the right to keep them in
as long as they see fit.

23:49.177 --> 23:50.970
(Mr Buckley)
I see.

23:53.348 --> 23:55.349
(Archie)
I'm sorry, Dave.

24:03.275 --> 24:04.567
(Skunk)
What's it like?

24:04.651 --> 24:05.985
I don't know. I don't know.

24:06.194 --> 24:07.778
ls it like One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest?

24:07.863 --> 24:09.363
(moaning)

24:09.448 --> 24:12.032
- Stop it!
- Wait, hang on. You saw that?

24:12.117 --> 24:14.285
(Jed) Kasia fell asleep
in front of the telly one night.

24:14.494 --> 24:16.745
Oh, my God. Was she drinking?

24:17.080 --> 24:18.622
- (tuts)
- What? I'm joking.

24:18.790 --> 24:20.499
- Ooh.
- (Skunk) They cut a part

24:20.584 --> 24:21.667
- of his brain out.
- (Mike) Who?

24:21.751 --> 24:23.586
- McMurphy.
- (moaning)

24:23.670 --> 24:24.837
- Stop it!
- (Kasia) Jed.

24:24.921 --> 24:27.506
(Mike) Look, listen, that is not
gonna happen to Rick, okay?

24:27.674 --> 24:28.841
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

24:28.925 --> 24:31.051
- How do you know?
- Because I just know.

24:31.261 --> 24:33.637
That sort of stuff, you know,
it just isn't...

24:33.722 --> 24:36.682
- (moans) ...done any more.
- Ugh. Stop it.

24:36.766 --> 24:39.101
All right, let's go and make these things fly.

24:44.316 --> 24:45.941
- Whoa.
- (laughs)

24:47.319 --> 24:48.819
(all laugh)

25:09.007 --> 25:11.842
(Mike) ...fucking obsessing!
Every single...

25:11.927 --> 25:15.054
(Kasia) lt's because you're avoiding...
I'm not obsessing about a thing.

25:15.430 --> 25:16.805
(Mike) Why can't we just have
a normal...

25:16.890 --> 25:19.600
(Mike, whispering) Why can't
we just have a normal conversation?

25:19.684 --> 25:22.895
When I come over here,
it's my life, my life. What am I doing?

25:22.979 --> 25:25.606
Can I just live my life? I'm getting
this job because you asked me...

25:25.690 --> 25:26.899
(Kasia) What are you doing with me?

25:26.983 --> 25:28.400
You know what, I am fucking out of here.

25:28.485 --> 25:30.569
I was just about to say that you should...

25:30.654 --> 25:32.613
(Mike)
 I'm actually going! So there you go!

25:32.697 --> 25:35.991
- (Kasia) Where are you going now?
- Fucking home to my manky flat.

25:36.201 --> 25:37.368
(Kasia)
Asshole.

25:37.452 --> 25:39.078
I mean, why the hell are you with a person

25:39.162 --> 25:42.081
unless you plan
to stay with that person, you know?

25:42.165 --> 25:44.833
- (Mike) Fucking out of here!
- (screams indistinctly)

25:44.918 --> 25:46.919
(Kasia)
Fucking coward. Asshole.

25:51.550 --> 25:53.008
(sighs)

25:54.761 --> 25:56.303
Are you and Mike splitting up?

25:57.931 --> 25:59.431
Go to bed.

25:59.724 --> 26:01.475
(Kasia)
And the things he said to me...

26:01.560 --> 26:02.935
- You know what he called me?
- What?

26:03.019 --> 26:06.063
- Obsessive fucking bitch.
- Mm.

26:06.898 --> 26:07.898
Fuck you!

26:08.692 --> 26:13.654
I'm just so worn out with it, Archie, you know?

26:17.993 --> 26:21.203
Well, we could sue him, I suppose.

26:21.288 --> 26:23.539
- Yeah, for what?
- I don't know.

26:24.124 --> 26:26.208
Dereliction of premarital duty.

26:26.668 --> 26:31.005
Very funny.
How about just for being a dick?

26:31.089 --> 26:33.299
- Yeah, we could get him for that.
- A lazy dick.

26:33.383 --> 26:36.844
He values his freedom too much, his comforts.

26:37.012 --> 26:41.181
Well, most men do.
That's why we need that push.

26:41.474 --> 26:43.100
I've been pushing long enough.

26:43.435 --> 26:46.270
Four years.
I'm 35 years old, you know?

26:46.354 --> 26:48.606
- Really?
- Fuck off. I can't wait any more

26:48.690 --> 26:50.441
I just can't.

26:51.735 --> 26:53.527
- (Archie) ls that my wine?
- No.

26:54.571 --> 26:56.238
(doorbell rings)

27:01.328 --> 27:03.412
What are you doing here?

27:03.538 --> 27:05.539
Just thought I'd knock about.

27:06.041 --> 27:07.249
Jed isn't here.

27:13.173 --> 27:16.759
(Skunk)
 So angry. And she was crying and...

27:16.843 --> 27:19.219
- I think she really loved him.
- Yeah?

27:19.429 --> 27:23.390
(Skunk) I think she wanted them
to get married. Or buy a house.

27:23.516 --> 27:25.934
- Or have a baby maybe.
- Right.

27:26.061 --> 27:28.020
- I would have married him.
- Yeah?

27:28.104 --> 27:29.563
Mm.

27:29.648 --> 27:31.106
(crane whirring)

27:35.862 --> 27:37.237
Oh, wow.

27:42.952 --> 27:44.411
Come on!

27:47.749 --> 27:49.416
Oh, wow.

27:58.468 --> 27:59.885
Dillon!

28:05.266 --> 28:07.726
This is really cool. lt's like...

28:08.061 --> 28:09.978
Come in.

28:12.273 --> 28:14.942
- You're a really cool girl.
- Thanks.

28:15.276 --> 28:16.276
For a lesbian.

28:18.071 --> 28:19.571
(chuckles)

28:24.828 --> 28:25.828
Do you want a Nik Nak?

28:27.497 --> 28:29.498
No, thanks.

28:31.376 --> 28:33.627
Must be a pain
not being able to eat what you want.

28:37.590 --> 28:39.591
Do you want to be my girlfriend?

28:41.845 --> 28:43.470
Okay.

28:44.514 --> 28:45.556
Can I have a kiss?

28:46.933 --> 28:48.684
M... Maybe later.

28:49.185 --> 28:53.689
All right, but later
my mouth's gonna be all Nik-y Nak-y.

28:54.774 --> 28:58.444
All right. But not a splasher.

28:59.195 --> 29:00.904
- A what?
- No swirly tongues.

29:01.990 --> 29:04.324
(chuckles)
Okay.

29:20.633 --> 29:22.760
(Jed) Look, you've got pretty ears.
lt doesn't hurt that much.

29:22.844 --> 29:24.928
- (laughs) Get off. lt hurts.
- Stop it.

29:25.013 --> 29:26.972
(both laughing)

29:28.349 --> 29:29.892
Get your arms out.

29:29.976 --> 29:32.311
- There, one up your nose.
- No, no. (laughs)

29:33.897 --> 29:36.940
Look, if you keep moving your arms,
I can't give you a lovely nose piercing.

29:39.569 --> 29:42.279
- Get off.
- You look so pretty.

29:44.991 --> 29:46.992
Give me your eyebrow.

29:49.746 --> 29:51.121
- There we go.
- (Skunk gurgles)

29:51.206 --> 29:53.290
(Kasia)
 All right, guys. Come on, bed.

29:53.374 --> 29:54.541
- But we're doing our books.
- (Skunk laughs)

29:54.751 --> 29:55.959
Bed.

29:56.127 --> 29:57.586
(Skunk whines) Dad.

29:57.670 --> 30:00.422
Come on, do as you're told.
Big day tomorrow.

30:01.633 --> 30:03.342
Night, Dad.

30:04.719 --> 30:06.512
- Good night, love.
- Good night.

30:06.596 --> 30:07.596
Very attractive.

30:07.680 --> 30:11.517
- (Jed growls)
- Yeah, all right, yeah. Good, yeah.

30:11.601 --> 30:13.018
(Jed chuckles)

30:13.102 --> 30:14.728
Hey, where's mine?

30:14.813 --> 30:16.230
(both) Night, Kasia.

30:16.314 --> 30:17.856
Very funny.

30:17.941 --> 30:19.566
- And don't forget teeth!
- (Skunk laughs)

30:30.620 --> 30:32.120
You want a drink?

30:33.164 --> 30:35.624
(Jed) And if you're wearing trainers,
they'll stomp on them. Bang!

30:35.708 --> 30:36.834
And if your hair's too long,

30:36.918 --> 30:38.460
what they'll do is they'll grab it from behind.

30:38.545 --> 30:40.712
- All right. Stop!
- And they'll just start...

30:41.589 --> 30:44.049
(sighs) 
You need so know about this stuff, Skunk.

30:44.133 --> 30:46.552
The better prepared you are,
the better you'll do.

30:47.262 --> 30:50.639
So, what they do
is they grab your hair from behind

30:50.807 --> 30:53.517
and they just start snipping away
with a pair of scissors.

30:53.601 --> 30:55.644
- So you pick your moment.
- Yeah.

30:56.104 --> 30:57.521
And you let them know the arrangement.

30:57.647 --> 30:59.481
Yeah... What?

30:59.566 --> 31:01.441
- The deal.
- Right.

31:02.694 --> 31:04.695
And then they know where they stand.

31:05.321 --> 31:07.406
- Yeah.
- Which is...

31:08.032 --> 31:11.118
- Nowhere.
- Absolutely fucking nowhere.

31:11.286 --> 31:12.703
(laughing)

31:15.707 --> 31:19.710
- lt's funnier later on.
- Okay.

31:51.868 --> 31:53.869
(Kasia)
What about Rachel?

31:56.706 --> 31:58.415
What about her?

31:58.708 --> 32:00.500
(Kasia)
lf she walked in right now,

32:01.544 --> 32:03.170
would you take her back?

32:03.254 --> 32:04.671
You must be joking.

32:07.383 --> 32:10.135
- Not even for the kids?
- Why?

32:10.553 --> 32:12.763
So they could live in fear
of her walking out again

32:12.847 --> 32:15.599
whenever she felt like it?
No, thank you very much.

32:17.018 --> 32:18.644
They wouldn't even know

32:18.978 --> 32:20.604
who she was.

32:21.689 --> 32:23.106
Poor Archie.

32:27.028 --> 32:29.029
Poor Kasia.

32:50.635 --> 32:52.636
I'm off to bed.

32:53.221 --> 32:55.222
All right, then.

32:57.183 --> 32:59.184
- Good night.
- Good night.

33:05.692 --> 33:07.693
You can follow me up if you want.

33:13.116 --> 33:14.616
(sighs)

33:26.462 --> 33:28.088
(Skunk)
Dad?

33:31.009 --> 33:32.551
Dad!

33:38.057 --> 33:39.725
Why aren't you in bed?

33:39.809 --> 33:42.978
Jed said I was gonna get
my head flushed down the toilet.

33:43.187 --> 33:45.397
- By who?
- ln school.

33:46.524 --> 33:49.568
- And you believed him?
- And punched in the stomach.

33:49.777 --> 33:51.737
Yeah, I believe him. He said it's...

33:51.821 --> 33:52.904
He said it's tradition.

33:52.989 --> 33:55.532
I was told the very same thing
when I was your age.

33:55.616 --> 33:57.743
- That's the tradition.
- What is?

33:57.994 --> 34:00.078
Putting the fear of God into the first years.

34:00.163 --> 34:02.497
Nothing's gonna happen to you.

34:04.000 --> 34:06.543
Come on, then. Up you get.

34:08.504 --> 34:10.505
- Night.
- Good night.

34:13.885 --> 34:18.054
Dad, will you lie next to me till I go to sleep?

34:26.563 --> 34:28.065
Dad!

34:33.071 --> 34:34.612
(overlapping chatter)

34:57.345 --> 34:59.387
My God, Mike!

35:00.223 --> 35:04.726
- lt's Mr Kiernan in school, Skunk.
- Oh.

35:04.811 --> 35:07.020
- Not Mike.
- Oh, right.

35:08.231 --> 35:11.024
Well, in that case
you can call me Miss Cunningham.

35:11.609 --> 35:13.777
(chuckles) Fair enough.

35:14.028 --> 35:16.279
Okay, everyone. My name is Mr Kiernan.

35:16.447 --> 35:17.739
(school bell rings)

35:26.874 --> 35:28.625
Uh, Miss Cunningham.

35:28.709 --> 35:30.877
Yes, Mr Kiernan?

35:30.962 --> 35:33.880
Um, how is Kasia?

35:33.965 --> 35:35.215
Kasia's fine.

35:36.217 --> 35:39.261
Will you, um, say hi to her for me?

35:39.387 --> 35:40.762
Do you have a message back?

35:41.264 --> 35:42.264
I do.

35:42.557 --> 35:43.723
Dick.

35:43.975 --> 35:44.975
Excuse me?

35:45.810 --> 35:47.477
lt's what she said.

35:48.729 --> 35:49.980
(Fiona) How many did you get?

35:50.106 --> 35:51.731
- (Skunk) A hundred.
- Shit.

35:51.816 --> 35:53.233
And one of the long ones.

35:53.317 --> 35:55.068
"I must not use inappropriate language..."

35:55.778 --> 35:57.612
What the hell did you just do that for?

35:57.697 --> 36:00.532
Sit down. Give me some money.

36:00.658 --> 36:02.367
- What?
- Some money.

36:02.451 --> 36:03.910
- Why?
- 'Cause I want some.

36:03.995 --> 36:06.955
And if you don't, my sister's
gonna kick the fucking shit out of you.

36:07.331 --> 36:10.208
- (Fiona) How much?
- All you got. Get it all out.

36:10.293 --> 36:11.626
You as well.

36:11.711 --> 36:12.794
Go on, quick! Hurry up!

36:13.629 --> 36:17.966
Now, every week, from next week on,
I want £2 from each of you.

36:18.050 --> 36:19.092
What?

36:19.177 --> 36:20.343
That's what it costs to stay off the list.

36:20.428 --> 36:22.971
- (Fiona) What list?
- The list of fucking death, bitch.

36:23.181 --> 36:27.392
Here's your shit fucking loser's
out-of-date fucking mobile.

36:28.561 --> 36:30.687
- lt's broken.
- (Fiona) What?

36:31.314 --> 36:35.525
The cow. The absolute fucking ugly...

36:35.943 --> 36:37.444
Go on.

36:38.404 --> 36:40.864
- How many did you get?
- Two hundred.

36:43.576 --> 36:45.368
Must be one of the bad ones.

36:47.038 --> 36:48.538
Can I get a new phone?

36:50.291 --> 36:52.125
- You've got a phone.
- lt broke.

36:52.210 --> 36:54.044
- Can I get a new one?
- No.

36:54.128 --> 36:55.337
Why not?

36:55.421 --> 36:57.380
You should have taken better care
of the old one.

36:59.759 --> 37:01.176
(Skunk)
lt would make me so happy.

37:01.427 --> 37:03.178
Quiet, Skunk.

37:04.388 --> 37:06.389
I'd just be the happiest child.

37:08.851 --> 37:10.268
I'm trying to work, love.

37:11.312 --> 37:12.979
(knocking on door)

37:16.317 --> 37:18.401
♪ <i>I'd be delirious! ♫</i> ♪

37:18.569 --> 37:20.654
lt's just not fair.

37:20.738 --> 37:23.615
- I don't care.
- You don't care about me.

37:23.699 --> 37:25.492
Yeah, he doesn't care about me.

37:25.701 --> 37:27.035
(mimics telephone ringing)

37:28.621 --> 37:30.163
Go away, Skunk!

37:30.248 --> 37:32.374
He hates me. That's what he said.

37:33.626 --> 37:34.793
- Please.
- Stop it.

37:34.877 --> 37:36.628
Please, Dad.

37:36.712 --> 37:38.880
- He wishes I was dead.
- What?

37:39.757 --> 37:41.424
- Nothing.
- (beeps)

37:42.927 --> 37:44.094
Please!

37:44.178 --> 37:46.012
Emily!

37:48.307 --> 37:50.141
I don't want to hear it again.

37:50.685 --> 37:52.185
Do you understand me?

37:52.728 --> 37:54.437
Do you understand me?!

37:57.608 --> 37:59.109
(Jed, mockingly)
Emily.

38:17.503 --> 38:20.088
(Dillon) What time is it?
(Skunk) Ten past ten.

38:20.381 --> 38:22.382
(Skunk)
Do you think he's learnt his lesson yet?

38:22.466 --> 38:24.301
- (girl yelps)
- Who's this?

38:24.385 --> 38:26.094
(Susan laughs)

38:33.686 --> 38:35.270
(Skunk)
Susan Oswald.

38:36.772 --> 38:38.315
Slut.

38:38.774 --> 38:40.191
No, she's not.

38:43.070 --> 38:44.529
- Told you.
- (unzipping)

38:46.115 --> 38:47.574
(sighs)

38:47.950 --> 38:50.660
They call that fell-at-io.

38:52.621 --> 38:54.205
(Susan moaning)

38:55.499 --> 38:57.042
I have to go home.

39:01.005 --> 39:04.841
(Kasia) Where have you been?
Why didn't you call?

39:05.384 --> 39:07.218
I don't have a phone.

39:07.762 --> 39:12.432
You little brat!
How dare you do what you just did!

39:13.434 --> 39:14.976
Sit down!

39:18.189 --> 39:19.773
(dialling)

39:23.194 --> 39:26.654
Yes, she's here. She's fine.

39:29.450 --> 39:30.825
(Skunk)
Sorry, Dad.

39:47.218 --> 39:48.301
(breathes heavily)

39:55.017 --> 39:57.018
(Skunk)
Dad.

39:57.478 --> 39:58.978
My levels are off.

40:01.690 --> 40:04.484
(Archie)
You can never forget how important this is.

40:04.527 --> 40:05.652
I know.

40:07.071 --> 40:10.365
I know it's routine, I know it's hard...

40:11.325 --> 40:13.493
- Say it's okay, Dad.
- What?

40:14.328 --> 40:15.995
I said I was sorry.

40:16.831 --> 40:18.998
Now you have to say it's okay.

40:29.009 --> 40:30.260
lt's okay.

40:37.226 --> 40:39.394
What would you do if I died, Dad?

40:41.439 --> 40:43.606
I can't even answer that question.

40:43.691 --> 40:45.191
Would you cry?

40:45.234 --> 40:46.401
Uh-huh.

40:46.527 --> 40:47.861
A lot?

40:47.903 --> 40:49.904
I don't think I'd ever stop.

40:50.114 --> 40:51.448
What if I...

40:51.949 --> 40:54.451
(groans and gasps)

40:59.582 --> 41:01.458
(laughs)
Stop!

41:01.709 --> 41:03.126
- No.
- Get off!

41:03.210 --> 41:04.544
Get off!

41:04.587 --> 41:05.712
(laughs)

41:07.423 --> 41:10.383
- Tell about the night I was born.
- No.

41:10.926 --> 41:12.969
- Go on.
- I don't know. Why?

41:13.053 --> 41:15.889
- The night, or the...
- The dream.

41:16.474 --> 41:18.224
- Please. Come on.
- No. Not again.

41:18.309 --> 41:19.893
- Tell me.
- Why do you...

41:19.977 --> 41:22.812
- I don't even know why you like this.
- I just do. Come on.

41:23.981 --> 41:27.233
- All right, well, it's about this woman.
- Mm-hm.

41:27.318 --> 41:30.320
- And different times in her life.
- Different moments. Yes.

41:30.404 --> 41:31.946
- Different moments.
- Like what?

41:32.072 --> 41:33.990
- I can't remember.
- Think.

41:34.074 --> 41:35.950
- I can't remember.
- Try.

41:38.412 --> 41:41.998
- Um... Well, some of them are sad.
- Hmm.

41:43.000 --> 41:44.959
- But most of them are happy.
- Hmm.

41:45.794 --> 41:47.587
(Skunk)
And the woman was me.

41:47.671 --> 41:49.088
(Archie)
And the woman was you.

41:49.590 --> 41:51.508
And the dream was my future.

41:51.592 --> 41:52.926
I don't know about that.

41:52.968 --> 41:56.095
I mean, that's what it felt like,
yeah, but, yeah...

41:57.806 --> 41:59.807
But what did I look like?

42:01.477 --> 42:02.769
Hideous.

42:03.521 --> 42:05.146
You're nice.

42:05.272 --> 42:06.523
Stunning.

42:07.441 --> 42:08.942
And then you woke.

42:08.984 --> 42:12.529
And then I woke, and I was happy
and I was sad all at the same time.

42:12.613 --> 42:14.113
And Mum was there.

42:14.490 --> 42:16.824
She was the one that woke me up.

42:17.826 --> 42:19.452
And she said...

42:19.787 --> 42:22.288
(both)
"Archie, she's here."

42:23.791 --> 42:25.542
- Meaning me.
- Meaning you.

42:25.626 --> 42:27.168
Well, you were the one
about to be born, weren't you?

42:27.294 --> 42:28.461
(sniffs)

42:31.465 --> 42:32.882
Oh, Skunk.

42:32.967 --> 42:35.385
- I can't help it.
- I know.

42:42.142 --> 42:45.061
(Archie)
You're such a strange girl.

42:45.354 --> 42:46.813
(Skunk sniffs)

42:59.910 --> 43:01.244
Wah!

43:01.328 --> 43:03.162
Come on, let's get this done.

43:08.419 --> 43:11.045
Here, you do it.

Skunk, we can go in now, love.

43:54.089 --> 43:55.715
- Hi, Skunk.
- Hi.

43:57.718 --> 43:59.218
(Mr Buckley)
Why don't you sit down there, Skunk?

43:59.261 --> 44:00.720
(Skunk)
Okay.

44:02.431 --> 44:05.266
- How are you?
- (Skunk) I'm fine.

44:05.392 --> 44:08.728
- Why are you talking like that?
- (Mr Buckley) lt's his medication.

44:08.812 --> 44:12.607
- Talking like what?
- Kind of groggy.

44:14.568 --> 44:15.652
Am I?

44:16.320 --> 44:18.154
(all chuckle)

44:19.740 --> 44:21.449
Wow. You've got your own telly and all.

44:21.575 --> 44:24.118
Oh, yeah. You know, I...
I watch, um...

44:33.420 --> 44:36.089
- I'm sorry.
- No, no.

44:37.591 --> 44:39.842
- How's school?
- (Skunk) lt's fine.

44:39.927 --> 44:41.177
We're actually on a half day today.

44:41.261 --> 44:43.179
- lsn't she good to come, Rick?
- Yes, she is.

44:43.263 --> 44:45.515
- She asked to, you know.
- She's really good.

44:46.433 --> 44:49.185
I always thought
Skunk was really good, didn't I?

44:49.269 --> 44:50.645
- (Mrs Buckley) Uh-huh.
- I don't know.

44:50.771 --> 44:51.771
(all laughing)

44:54.525 --> 44:56.317
What was it like?

44:56.777 --> 44:57.985
Hmm?

44:58.112 --> 44:59.195
You know, when you went kind of mad?

44:59.780 --> 45:02.490
- That's...
- ls it all right if I say that?

45:06.954 --> 45:09.664
Actually, it's really hard to describe.

45:11.291 --> 45:15.712
But it's kind of like there was a toxic cloud.

45:16.296 --> 45:18.381
- A toxic cloud?
- Yeah, or a...

45:18.966 --> 45:22.176
a mist of evil or something.

45:22.511 --> 45:23.553
Really?

45:24.179 --> 45:25.722
- Or badness.
- Wow.

45:25.806 --> 45:27.640
- Yeah.
- (both laugh)

45:28.225 --> 45:29.350
ls it there right now?

45:30.644 --> 45:32.228
(Mrs Buckley)
Uh... Less.

45:32.312 --> 45:34.397
ln fact, Dr Sinclair was saying
at this rate of improvement,

45:34.481 --> 45:35.982
Rick might be able to come home for the weekend.

45:36.024 --> 45:37.316
- lsn't that right, son?
- When?

45:37.401 --> 45:39.318
- Not, not now.
- No, no, no.

45:39.361 --> 45:40.528
- No, not now.
- (Mr Buckley) No, not now.

45:40.654 --> 45:42.029
But soon.

45:46.493 --> 45:47.827
(laughs)

45:50.080 --> 45:51.998
(Dillon)
I had an uncle who was a nutter like that.

45:52.082 --> 45:54.208
- Thought he had worms in his hair.
- Oh, yeah?

45:54.334 --> 45:56.335
Yeah, like nesting there.

45:57.045 --> 46:00.047
Shaved it all off.
Been bald ever since.

46:00.174 --> 46:03.342
- ls he better, though?
- No, he's worse.

46:03.510 --> 46:06.679
He lives in Florida now.
D'you know, they have lizards there.

46:06.930 --> 46:09.849
- What?
- Lizards, millions of 'em,

46:09.933 --> 46:12.018
just walking round the streets.

46:12.102 --> 46:13.686
(in American accent)
"Hey, how you doin'?"

46:13.771 --> 46:15.062
(laughs)

46:15.189 --> 46:17.398
You and I should go sometime, d'you know that?

46:17.524 --> 46:18.608
When?

46:19.026 --> 46:21.360
I don't know. One day.

46:22.571 --> 46:24.238
Why? Would you come
if I asked you to?

46:24.364 --> 46:25.448
Yeah.

46:25.532 --> 46:27.200
What about that guy you're in love with?

46:27.242 --> 46:29.202
- Mike.
- That teacher.

46:29.286 --> 46:32.205
He'd understand.
I'm in love with you as well.

46:32.915 --> 46:35.374
Sweet. They call that a "ménage à trois."

46:35.876 --> 46:36.918
What does that mean?

46:37.044 --> 46:38.377
Love triangle.

46:38.462 --> 46:40.213
- Give us a kiss.
- No.

46:49.139 --> 46:50.223
Nice one.

46:59.149 --> 47:00.983
(Fiona)
I don't know. lt was like...

47:01.068 --> 47:04.487
I think he just switched off
or something. Click.

47:05.072 --> 47:08.741
Click and he just wasn't there any more.

47:09.576 --> 47:10.910
(Sunrise)
Hello, fatty.

47:11.328 --> 47:12.662
I haven't got it.

47:13.497 --> 47:14.622
You haven't got it?

47:14.748 --> 47:18.167
- Are you fucking joking?
- Let me go.

47:18.252 --> 47:19.669
Let go!

47:20.963 --> 47:22.797
(stifles laughter)

47:23.131 --> 47:27.260
- Fucking laughing?
- No. I'm sorry, Sunrise.

47:27.427 --> 47:28.469
Bitch, you're gone!

47:28.595 --> 47:29.762
History, yeah?

47:29.805 --> 47:34.267
You're now officially on the list.
Just you fucking wait!

47:34.309 --> 47:35.935
Dumpy little turd.

47:39.189 --> 47:40.356
(Vikram)
Does he die?

47:40.524 --> 47:41.691
(Mike)
I can't tell you if he dies or not

47:41.775 --> 47:44.318
because that's why we read, to find out, okay?

47:44.444 --> 47:46.487
But let's just all agree there is a chance

47:46.613 --> 47:48.364
that he may die, all right?

47:48.448 --> 47:50.116
- (Vikram) I don't want him to.
- All right.

47:50.158 --> 47:53.035
(clears throat)
Now, why do we think he goes on? Kevin?

47:53.120 --> 47:54.287
Well, his life was rubbish, weren't it?

47:54.329 --> 47:55.621
And boring.

47:55.873 --> 47:57.790
Whereas through the doors
there could be wicked shit.

47:57.875 --> 48:00.293
- Like dragons.
- Like dragons and shit.

48:00.335 --> 48:02.003
- Trolls.
- Yeah, like teachers.

48:02.129 --> 48:03.671
(overlapping chatter)

48:04.381 --> 48:05.715
(Mike)
Everyone, just wait, wait.

48:05.799 --> 48:07.341
That, what Kevin said,

48:07.676 --> 48:10.970
is the definition of courage. Right?

48:11.054 --> 48:12.638
Being afraid...

48:15.183 --> 48:17.310
but doing it anyway.

48:17.394 --> 48:19.312
(Vikram) I still would not go.
(Boy) 'Course you wouldn't go.

48:19.396 --> 48:20.855
(Vikram) I wouldn't want to die.

48:21.899 --> 48:24.692
- He doesn't die, Vikram.
- You told me the end!

48:24.818 --> 48:26.193
Why did you have to ruin it?

48:26.320 --> 48:28.821
(all yelling)
Why? Why?

48:28.864 --> 48:31.574
(yelling continues, echoes)

49:04.024 --> 49:05.524
You all right?

49:12.866 --> 49:14.367
(Skunk grunts)

49:14.701 --> 49:16.869
- Please...
- Frigid slut.

49:17.120 --> 49:18.204
- Please.
- Hold her.

49:18.372 --> 49:19.705
I'm trying.

49:21.583 --> 49:24.043
- Well, kick her while she's down, then.
- I am!

49:24.086 --> 49:26.128
- Properly, in the ribs.
- I am! Watch! I am!

49:26.213 --> 49:28.381
- Do it harder than that.
- God, shut up!

49:28.423 --> 49:29.590
Do it in the ribs, not the arm.

49:29.716 --> 49:32.051
- Shut up! I'll kick you next time!
- Harder!

49:32.135 --> 49:34.387
- What you doing?
- What the hell is going on here?

49:34.429 --> 49:35.471
Come on.

49:35.722 --> 49:37.139
Skunk, you all right?

49:37.224 --> 49:39.558
Listen, if you fucking touch me
like that again, I'll report you.

49:39.601 --> 49:40.643
- Oh, you'll report me, will you?
- Yeah.

49:40.727 --> 49:42.228
How old are you? Come on!

49:42.312 --> 49:43.896
- She's half your size.
- Oh, fuck off, you paedo.

49:43.981 --> 49:45.398
(Mike) Go on, get out of here.
Get out of my sight.

49:45.440 --> 49:47.650
- Hey, Sunrise, get back here.
- What are you doing? That's my sister.

49:47.734 --> 49:49.151
- Stay right there.
- Don't talk to my sister like that.

49:49.236 --> 49:50.277
(Mike)
Come here.

49:50.404 --> 49:52.071
- Fucking queer.
- Down there. Stand down there.

49:52.155 --> 49:53.823
- You, be quiet.
- Why are you listening to him for?

49:53.907 --> 49:55.992
- He's a teacher, Sas.
- Yeah, just get out of here!

49:56.576 --> 49:59.996
(Mike) For the next two weeks,
you're gonna come here for...

50:00.080 --> 50:02.415
(Sunrise) Yeah, right.
(Mike) Sunrise, look at me.

50:05.293 --> 50:08.587
For an hour and a half's detention
after school, starting tomorrow.

50:09.423 --> 50:12.023
Do you understand?

50:19.599 --> 50:22.435
Good. Go home.

50:27.691 --> 50:29.442
(Mike)
She had a bit of a run-in with another girl,

50:29.526 --> 50:31.527
but we sorted it out and everything's fine,

50:31.611 --> 50:33.529
so don't worry, it's...

50:34.114 --> 50:35.781
Mike rescued me.

50:35.866 --> 50:37.491
- (Kasia) Really?
- Hmm.

50:39.202 --> 50:41.454
- Can I have a jam sandwich?
- Okay.

50:43.373 --> 50:45.541
Go change out of your uniform first.

50:45.625 --> 50:46.834
(groans)

50:52.549 --> 50:53.966
(clears throat)

50:54.968 --> 50:57.011
Here, I'll... I'll get that.

51:00.223 --> 51:02.308
(muttering)
Butter...

51:15.155 --> 51:17.531
You know, it's kind of weird, isn't it,

51:17.657 --> 51:19.575
when you're in the middle of something,

51:19.659 --> 51:23.704
how things can be so, uh, confusing, you know?

51:23.830 --> 51:25.414
- Unclear.
- What are you talking about?

51:25.499 --> 51:28.417
No. Whereas, you know,
what I'm saying is,

51:28.502 --> 51:34.006
whereas with a bit of time
and a bit of distance and perspective,

51:34.049 --> 51:35.674
things kind of...

51:39.721 --> 51:42.598
Look, whatever you want...

51:43.183 --> 51:44.350
Sorry?

51:44.768 --> 51:47.895
A house, a baby,

51:48.021 --> 51:50.940
whatever you want, I'll give you.

51:54.361 --> 51:56.195
- That's very kind of you, Mike.
- That's what I'm saying.

51:56.238 --> 51:58.364
lt took me, I don't know,
stepping away...

51:58.406 --> 51:59.532
(Kasia)
To get a perspective.

51:59.574 --> 52:03.202
Yes, and to realise
that the things that you want, Kasia,

52:03.286 --> 52:06.247
the things that you want are,
are the things that I want.

52:06.373 --> 52:08.916
Mike, I'm with Archie now.

52:11.711 --> 52:13.045
I'm sorry.

52:13.880 --> 52:16.132
(Mike)
You're with fucking Ar... Archie?

52:16.550 --> 52:17.800
(Kasia)
Yes.

52:17.884 --> 52:19.218
(Mike)
As lovers?

52:21.721 --> 52:25.224
Well, what? Are you in love?

52:26.726 --> 52:28.477
Yes.

52:30.814 --> 52:33.566
Well, I'm s... I'm so fucking...
I'm happy for you.

52:33.608 --> 52:35.609
I'm so fucking happy for you!

54:41.569 --> 54:43.237
(Sunrise)
Whose could it be?

54:43.571 --> 54:46.240
- Simon Malloy's.
- (Sunrise) Okay.

54:46.366 --> 54:48.200
Jed Cunningham. Dennis Woods.

54:48.285 --> 54:49.868
Jed Cunningham?

54:49.953 --> 54:51.287
- Yeah.
- Ugh.

54:51.538 --> 54:52.788
Who else?

54:53.206 --> 54:55.207
(Susan)
A couple of guys, I can't remember their names.

54:56.042 --> 54:58.711
- Who's that one with the dreadlocks?
- Brian Williams.

54:58.878 --> 55:01.714
- He's gonna fucking kill me, Sunrise!
- Shut up!

55:03.550 --> 55:05.759
Just let me think.

55:09.639 --> 55:11.140
(door closes)

55:21.151 --> 55:23.402
(DC Carson)
And when's the last time you saw Miss Oswald?

55:24.571 --> 55:26.405
Uh... Last Tuesday.

55:27.407 --> 55:28.574
Where?

55:29.117 --> 55:30.576
Outside the school.

55:30.618 --> 55:35.914
Uh, she was attacking another child,
so I had to...

55:37.625 --> 55:40.586
Sorry, did you say Sunrise?

55:41.463 --> 55:44.340
- Sorry?
- Um, Sunrise Oswald?

55:45.175 --> 55:46.342
Susan.

55:46.426 --> 55:48.469
- What did we say?
- Susan.

55:48.595 --> 55:51.513
Oh, right, sorry, 'cause I don't know Susan.

55:51.973 --> 55:54.350
lt was Sunrise who I reprimanded.

55:54.684 --> 55:57.144
- (DC Carson) You don't know her?
- No.

55:57.270 --> 55:59.355
Well, I mean, I know her, she's in the school,

55:59.439 --> 56:02.274
but I've never had any contact with her.

56:02.359 --> 56:03.650
(swallows)

56:04.527 --> 56:05.861
(DC Carson)
I see.

56:05.945 --> 56:07.363
Well, she claims you've been having an affair.

56:10.950 --> 56:12.451
(laughs)
What?

56:17.457 --> 56:19.792
Well, that's insane. She's a child.

56:19.834 --> 56:21.877
(DC Jenks)
She's 14 years old, Mr Kiernan.

56:22.337 --> 56:23.796
She's also pregnant.

56:33.473 --> 56:36.308
- Mr Kiernan?
- (teacher) Can I help you?

56:37.018 --> 56:38.227
- Mr Kiernan?
- Yes.

56:39.896 --> 56:41.146
(child screams)

56:41.481 --> 56:42.731
(grunts)

56:42.857 --> 56:44.483
- lt's all right, don't worry.
- Everybody, get out!

56:45.819 --> 56:47.653
(students screaming)

56:47.695 --> 56:49.154
(Mike grunts)

56:50.365 --> 56:51.824
Kids, out!

56:59.207 --> 57:00.374
(panting)

57:11.177 --> 57:12.344
(Skunk)
Mike.

57:12.720 --> 57:13.846
(groans)

57:15.348 --> 57:17.516
- (Sunrise) They're coming, Dad!
- (gasps)

57:18.893 --> 57:20.561
(Bob)
All right, all right, all right.

57:21.020 --> 57:23.522
Now, you know I'll be back, yeah?

57:23.565 --> 57:25.566
You know I'll make sure
everything's all right, yeah?

57:25.692 --> 57:27.943
- I love you so fucking much.
- Dad.

57:28.695 --> 57:29.862
Oh, thanks, love.

57:29.946 --> 57:33.949
And I love you so much, yeah?
Give us a kiss.

57:34.576 --> 57:36.869
Come here, come here. Come here.

57:36.911 --> 57:39.872
Oh, come on. Let's do a big
family fucking hug, yeah?

57:39.914 --> 57:41.373
- (Sunrise) I love you, Dad.
- I love you so much.

57:41.458 --> 57:43.792
- I love you, Dad. I love you.
- I love you, I love you, I love you.

57:44.752 --> 57:46.628
I love you, I love you, I love you.

57:46.713 --> 57:48.630
I love you, I love you, I love you.
I love you, I love you.

57:48.715 --> 57:50.257
(Sunrise)
I love you, Dad.

57:53.595 --> 57:54.761
Can you not cause a scene, all right?

57:54.888 --> 57:56.889
Saskia, no boys, all right? No parties.

57:56.973 --> 57:59.224
- Oh, fuck off.
- (girls shouting)

57:59.309 --> 58:00.642
Fuck off, you cunt!

58:00.727 --> 58:02.311
(shouting indistinctly)

58:04.147 --> 58:07.274
- Girls, get back inside.
- Get the fuck out of here!

58:14.157 --> 58:16.241
I've a right to call a solicitor, don't I?

58:16.451 --> 58:19.244
- (DC Jenks) Yes.
- I'd like to do that now.

58:19.287 --> 58:20.412
(knock on door)

58:20.455 --> 58:24.917
Sorry.
Uh... Mr Kiernan's solicitor's here.

58:29.756 --> 58:32.090
- So this is alleged?
- (DC Carson) Yes.

58:33.301 --> 58:34.760
You haven't arrested my client?

58:34.844 --> 58:37.804
(DC Carson)
For the moment, he's helping us with our inquiries.

58:38.014 --> 58:40.265
- Get your jacket on.
- Wait a minute.

58:40.350 --> 58:41.767
(Archie) No. She's a liar.
(DC Jenks) What?

58:41.809 --> 58:43.602
(Archie)
She's done this type of thing before.

58:43.686 --> 58:46.522
Another man,
another accusation, essentially of rape.

58:47.607 --> 58:49.650
Another lie.

58:49.776 --> 58:52.194
Look it up, Detective.

58:52.529 --> 58:54.112
So you have a decision to make.

58:54.197 --> 58:58.283
Either you release my client or...
you arrest him.

58:58.326 --> 59:01.954
And then we'll take this matter further
as her story falls apart.

59:07.961 --> 59:09.461
(Mike)
Thank you.

59:13.675 --> 59:16.009
You can thank Kasia.

59:17.470 --> 59:19.054
She's the one that asked me to...

59:19.138 --> 59:20.722
(clears throat)
Right.

59:20.807 --> 59:23.141
- ...come in for you.
- Yeah. How are you two doing?

59:25.687 --> 59:27.312
Well, I don't really want to talk about that.

59:27.355 --> 59:30.482
- Oh. Don't you?
- No.

59:30.567 --> 59:32.818
(laughs)
Why is that, Archie?

59:32.902 --> 59:35.487
ls that because what you have
is so fucking special

59:35.572 --> 59:36.863
it can't be articulated, huh?

59:36.990 --> 59:38.699
No, it's because it's none of your business.

59:38.825 --> 59:39.908
Fuck you.

59:40.326 --> 59:42.327
You know what? Fuck you.

59:43.329 --> 59:47.165
The last thing I need
beyond losing the woman that I love

59:47.250 --> 59:50.043
is to be obliged to the man
who fucking stole her.

59:50.169 --> 59:51.837
- Well, I didn't steal her...
- Yeah, well, you fuck...

59:51.921 --> 59:53.171
And there's no obligation.

59:53.256 --> 59:54.506
Oh, fuck off, Archie!

59:54.841 --> 59:58.010
Man, you couldn't be
more fucking patronising if you tried.

01:00:02.390 --> 01:00:04.099
(Skunk) Then what?
(Archie) I don't know, love.

01:00:04.183 --> 01:00:06.184
They'll probably give him some kind of DNA test.

01:00:06.227 --> 01:00:07.686
- Right.
- Right.

01:00:07.770 --> 01:00:09.896
- You know what that is, do you?
- Yes.

01:00:11.274 --> 01:00:12.691
- No.
- lt's a test

01:00:12.775 --> 01:00:15.861
- that'll show he isn't the father.
- But he isn't the father!

01:00:15.903 --> 01:00:17.362
- We know that, love.
- She's a liar.

01:00:17.447 --> 01:00:19.865
Everyone knows she's done it with...

01:00:21.409 --> 01:00:22.743
lots of boys.

01:00:22.869 --> 01:00:24.786
- lt doesn't matter, Skunk.
- Why not?

01:00:24.871 --> 01:00:26.038
Because they're boys.

01:00:26.289 --> 01:00:28.290
Mike is an adult. You understand?

01:00:28.374 --> 01:00:30.459
A teacher. ln this kind of situation,

01:00:30.543 --> 01:00:33.295
they have to be absolutely sure
of his innocence.

01:00:33.379 --> 01:00:34.755
(doorbell ringing)

01:00:34.881 --> 01:00:39.134
And until they are, they just can't
allow him to work with children.

01:00:39.218 --> 01:00:41.428
- So he's not coming back?
- (Archie) Not at the moment, no.

01:00:43.264 --> 01:00:44.640
Sorry, love.

01:00:45.892 --> 01:00:48.101
Skunk, it's your boyfriend.

01:00:48.895 --> 01:00:49.978
Birmingham?

01:00:51.397 --> 01:00:55.233
But I thought... I thought you and me
were gonna go to Florida

01:00:55.318 --> 01:00:58.236
- and see... see the lizards and stuff.
- Yeah, I know, but...

01:00:58.279 --> 01:00:59.905
That was when we were older.

01:00:59.947 --> 01:01:01.573
Why not now, though?

01:01:01.616 --> 01:01:04.743
Because my aunt says
I have to go to Birmingham, Skunk.

01:01:04.827 --> 01:01:06.912
What am I gonna do without you?

01:01:10.667 --> 01:01:12.668
- Here.
- (sighs)

01:01:13.586 --> 01:01:16.755
- Will you take this?
- Why should I?

01:01:17.757 --> 01:01:19.841
To remember me by.

01:01:23.596 --> 01:01:25.597
When do you go?

01:01:26.307 --> 01:01:27.933
Tomorrow.

01:01:29.602 --> 01:01:32.437
Early. So I'm not
gonna get to see you again.

01:01:32.522 --> 01:01:34.439
How long did you know that?

01:01:36.943 --> 01:01:38.485
How long did you know, Dillon?!

01:01:38.611 --> 01:01:40.278
- Skunk.
- You're only telling me now!

01:01:40.321 --> 01:01:41.947
- Why haven't you told me?!
- Skunk, stop.

01:01:42.031 --> 01:01:43.115
You're an arsehole, Dillon.

01:01:43.199 --> 01:01:45.117
I wanted to tell you, but I was afraid to.

01:01:46.035 --> 01:01:47.828
Please don't hate me.

01:01:47.954 --> 01:01:49.788
You're leaving me, Dillon.

01:01:50.289 --> 01:01:52.124
'Course I hate you.

01:01:52.542 --> 01:01:54.292
I'll always hate you!

01:01:55.795 --> 01:01:58.296
(Mrs Buckley)
Oh, it's lopsided.

01:01:58.381 --> 01:02:00.048
(Mr Buckley) It's okay.
(Mrs Buckley) No, it's not.

01:02:00.133 --> 01:02:01.174
(Mr Buckley)
It's fine.

01:02:01.467 --> 01:02:02.634
Fine?

01:02:03.302 --> 01:02:05.637
Well, I wanted it to be perfect.

01:02:06.389 --> 01:02:08.014
ls it edible?

01:02:09.308 --> 01:02:11.685
Well, of course it is.

01:02:11.811 --> 01:02:15.147
- Dave!
- Well, the message is...

01:02:15.189 --> 01:02:17.691
is clear enough.
That's all you want really, isn't it?

01:02:17.817 --> 01:02:21.361
Yeah, well... I suppose.

01:02:23.698 --> 01:02:25.323
Well, I'd better go.

01:02:25.366 --> 01:02:26.491
Hmm.

01:02:26.993 --> 01:02:28.034
He'll love it, Janet.

01:02:28.411 --> 01:02:29.536
Hmm.

01:02:43.843 --> 01:02:46.762
- (♫ drum and bass)
- (overlapping chatter)

01:03:02.945 --> 01:03:04.571
- Fuck off.
- Oi!

01:03:19.295 --> 01:03:22.380
- (doorbell ringing)
- Fuck off.

01:03:22.465 --> 01:03:24.549
ls anyone gonna get that?

01:03:24.634 --> 01:03:25.926
Saskia.

01:03:26.052 --> 01:03:27.552
(Saskia)
You get it.

01:03:27.637 --> 01:03:28.720
(ringing continues)

01:03:33.059 --> 01:03:35.101
(Girl)
Saskia. Saskia!

01:03:42.401 --> 01:03:44.486
- Yeah?
- All right?

01:03:45.238 --> 01:03:46.738
Can I ask you something?

01:03:46.781 --> 01:03:48.406
- What is it?
- Um...

01:03:49.992 --> 01:03:52.661
I just wanted you to know that,
if you wanted me to,

01:03:52.745 --> 01:03:54.412
I'd be the daddy.

01:03:54.831 --> 01:03:57.999
- The what?
- The... the dad.

01:03:58.251 --> 01:04:01.586
Uh... Of the baby.
T-Take responsibility for it.

01:04:02.171 --> 01:04:03.797
- You and me, we could get married.
- Jesus Christ.

01:04:03.923 --> 01:04:07.008
- Are you being serious?
- Yeah.

01:04:07.093 --> 01:04:09.845
Jed, we're having a party in here, all right?

01:04:09.929 --> 01:04:13.098
- Just don't call over again.
- But...

01:04:27.280 --> 01:04:29.865
(Archie)
Skunk? Are you okay?

01:04:31.367 --> 01:04:34.703
(Skunk)
Why didn't you tell me and Jed about you and Kasia?

01:04:40.167 --> 01:04:42.168
(Archie)
I'm sorry.

01:04:43.129 --> 01:04:45.881
- I was trying to find the right moment.
- Are you gonna marry her?

01:04:45.965 --> 01:04:48.800
- I don't know.
- Kasia, I know you're there!

01:04:49.677 --> 01:04:50.802
- Are you?
- I don't know, love.

01:04:50.887 --> 01:04:53.179
Because she'll leave us, Dad,
the way she left Mike.

01:04:53.306 --> 01:04:55.473
Like Mum left us. Like everyone does.

01:04:55.516 --> 01:04:58.310
- No, I won't.
- Yes, you will! Don't lie.

01:04:58.352 --> 01:05:01.187
lt'll all go wrong, Dad.
Everything always goes wrong.

01:05:01.314 --> 01:05:03.523
- Why do only bad things happen?
- Good things happen.

01:05:03.649 --> 01:05:05.317
Like what, your sex with Kasia?

01:05:05.401 --> 01:05:09.571
- Skunk, listen.
- What about me or Jed or Rick or Mike?

01:05:09.655 --> 01:05:11.865
- What about Mike, Kasia?
- Skunk, you need to stop.

01:05:11.991 --> 01:05:15.869
I don't want to talk to either of you.
Just get out! lt's my room!

01:05:16.203 --> 01:05:17.913
So let's, as much as we can,

01:05:17.997 --> 01:05:20.206
confine things to the home
for the weekend, okay?

01:05:20.333 --> 01:05:22.584
- Yes.
- Just to be safe this first time out.

01:05:22.668 --> 01:05:24.377
- Thank you, Doctor. Yes.
- Not at all.

01:05:24.503 --> 01:05:25.712
- Best of luck, Rick.
- Thank you.

01:05:25.838 --> 01:05:27.339
Have a great weekend.

01:05:48.110 --> 01:05:50.737
(♫ dubstep)

01:06:07.964 --> 01:06:12.133
Susan. Susan. Susan?

01:06:12.218 --> 01:06:13.927
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

01:06:14.053 --> 01:06:16.388
Susan. Susan!

01:06:16.722 --> 01:06:18.640
There's blood everywhere.
Why is there blood everywhere?

01:06:18.724 --> 01:06:21.559
(Sunrise) Call an ambulance!
Call an ambulance!

01:06:21.602 --> 01:06:24.771
- Susan!
- Call a fucking ambulance!

01:06:24.897 --> 01:06:27.983
- What's the fucking number?
- 999, you twat!

01:06:28.734 --> 01:06:31.319
(Mr Buckley)
I wonder if she means we can't have a kick-about.

01:06:31.404 --> 01:06:32.487
(laughs)
Hmm.

01:06:32.571 --> 01:06:33.822
Wouldn't mind
a bit of a kick-about, eh, Rick?

01:06:35.574 --> 01:06:37.575
I think I'd rather stay inside, Dad.

01:06:37.618 --> 01:06:41.830
Oh, well, yes, you're probably right.
Best to... Best to play by the book.

01:06:42.248 --> 01:06:48.086
Oh, Mum's made a cake that's...
lt's... lt's a bit lopsided.

01:06:48.295 --> 01:06:51.297
Just, uh, thought
I should warn you. (chuckles)

01:06:52.133 --> 01:06:54.217
(police chatter on radio)

01:06:54.760 --> 01:06:58.930
Well, what's going on here?
Nothing changes. (sighs)

01:06:58.973 --> 01:07:01.891
Well, we won't let it bother us, huh?

01:07:08.482 --> 01:07:11.818
Hello, my baby. Hello.

01:07:11.944 --> 01:07:14.112
(Mr Buckley)
What's... What's happening?

01:07:14.238 --> 01:07:16.740
(Mrs Buckley) Oh, just don't pay any
attention. Um... What are you doing?

01:07:16.782 --> 01:07:18.324
(Mr Buckley) Well, I've got to...
I forgot the milk,

01:07:18.451 --> 01:07:20.285
so just put the kettle on, I won't be long.

01:07:20.411 --> 01:07:22.620
- Why isn't she talking?
- Let's just get her in the ambulance.

01:07:22.705 --> 01:07:24.998
(Saskia) She's not even moving.
(paramedic) Move out the way, please.

01:07:25.124 --> 01:07:26.458
(Saskia)
Just hurry up and get her in there.

01:07:26.542 --> 01:07:28.043
(Sunrise)
Just tell them.

01:07:28.377 --> 01:07:30.462
(Mrs Buckley) Rick. Come on, Rick.
Just... Just come inside.

01:07:30.546 --> 01:07:33.381
There's nothing going on there
that's of any interest. Come on.

01:07:34.050 --> 01:07:35.133
You getting a good look, are you?

01:07:35.217 --> 01:07:37.135
Right, let's go in. Let's go in.

01:07:37.178 --> 01:07:38.553
- (Saskia) Pervert!
- Rick, come on...

01:07:38.637 --> 01:07:40.680
lt's 'cause of fucking scum like you
that this is happening.

01:07:40.806 --> 01:07:43.183
- (Mrs Buckley) Just go inside.
- You sicko!

01:07:43.309 --> 01:07:45.518
Go on, just piss off inside,
you fucking pervert!

01:07:46.645 --> 01:07:47.854
Fucking evil bastard!

01:07:50.483 --> 01:07:51.566
(Saskia)
You sick...

01:07:58.491 --> 01:08:00.075
Cup of tea, love?

01:08:03.079 --> 01:08:04.079
Hmm?

01:08:08.417 --> 01:08:10.418
Where are you going?

01:08:11.587 --> 01:08:14.339
- To... To my room.
- But...

01:08:15.174 --> 01:08:18.343
- Just... Just for a little...
- But I made you a cake, love.

01:08:18.886 --> 01:08:21.429
- I'll have some later, Mum.
- But you just got here.

01:08:21.514 --> 01:08:23.515
Rick, please don't go
to your room. Please, don't.

01:08:23.599 --> 01:08:25.517
Don't mind what those people say.
Please, don't.

01:08:25.600 --> 01:08:29.520
- But they're right. They're right.
- No, they're not right.

01:08:29.563 --> 01:08:33.566
They could not be more wrong.
Rick, you are kind and you are good!

01:08:33.692 --> 01:08:35.527
- They're right!
- You are so good.

01:08:35.611 --> 01:08:38.571
- No, they're right, Mum!
- No, stop it! Come back, Rick!

01:08:38.697 --> 01:08:40.406
Don't go to your room!
Don't go, Rick!

01:08:45.203 --> 01:08:47.372
Oh, hello, sir.
Your change, please.

01:08:47.456 --> 01:08:48.540
Oh, sorry.

01:08:48.624 --> 01:08:50.792
- Miles away. Thanks very much.
- Thank you. Good night.

01:08:50.876 --> 01:08:52.085
(Mr Buckley)
Good night.

01:09:27.246 --> 01:09:28.830
(door opening)

01:09:30.457 --> 01:09:31.832
(door closes)

01:09:33.627 --> 01:09:35.420
(Mr Buckley)
Janet?

01:09:36.671 --> 01:09:38.298
Janet?

01:09:39.258 --> 01:09:41.259
Oh, Christ.

01:09:41.426 --> 01:09:42.844
Jesus Christ.

01:09:43.845 --> 01:09:45.846
I'm sorry, Dad.

01:09:49.977 --> 01:09:51.978
Rick?

01:09:53.856 --> 01:09:57.817
- What did you do?
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

01:09:57.943 --> 01:09:59.444
What did you do?

01:10:07.036 --> 01:10:09.037
I need to call someone.

01:10:11.957 --> 01:10:14.292
- lt's gonna be all right.
- They'll say I'm bad.

01:10:14.376 --> 01:10:17.128
- No, no, no.
- They'll say that I'm bad like before.

01:10:17.213 --> 01:10:18.546
They have to come and look after your mother.

01:10:18.631 --> 01:10:19.964
You don't have to tell them.

01:10:20.049 --> 01:10:21.132
lt's all right, Rick.

01:10:21.175 --> 01:10:23.218
- You'll be all right. Everything's fine.
- (dialling)

01:10:23.302 --> 01:10:24.969
You don't have to tell them.

01:10:25.054 --> 01:10:26.638
You don't have to tell them, Dad!

01:10:41.028 --> 01:10:42.487
(policeman)
Mr Oswald?

01:11:52.766 --> 01:11:54.225
(door opens)

01:11:55.311 --> 01:11:56.894
Hi, Rick.

01:12:01.233 --> 01:12:02.233
(door closes)

01:12:02.318 --> 01:12:03.901
(man sobbing)

01:12:16.332 --> 01:12:18.166
(no audio)

01:12:30.763 --> 01:12:33.348
(sobbing continues)

01:12:35.351 --> 01:12:37.143
(no audio)

01:12:50.532 --> 01:12:52.825
(Bob sobs)
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

01:13:03.837 --> 01:13:05.671
(Archie)
I'm gonna kill her.

01:13:05.881 --> 01:13:08.216
- Maybe...
- Maybe what? Maybe what?

01:13:13.806 --> 01:13:16.641
She knows she can't come and go as she pleases.

01:13:18.310 --> 01:13:19.310
Call her again.

01:13:19.395 --> 01:13:21.396
She knows that from the last time.

01:13:26.985 --> 01:13:28.694
Skunk. Yeah, it's Dad.

01:13:28.821 --> 01:13:32.156
Yeah, listen, love,
I'm really, really, really worried,

01:13:32.199 --> 01:13:34.409
so could you call me, please, darling?

01:13:34.701 --> 01:13:36.577
All right. lt's Dad.

01:13:38.372 --> 01:13:40.331
- Where are you going?
- I'm going to look for her.

01:13:40.374 --> 01:13:42.166
- Dad.
- What?

01:13:43.168 --> 01:13:44.460
I think I might know where she is.

01:13:44.503 --> 01:13:45.545
(door slams)

01:13:57.766 --> 01:13:59.684
(mobile ringing)

01:14:01.103 --> 01:14:02.186
Archie!

01:14:02.271 --> 01:14:04.605
- (Mike) I'm sorry to ring so Iate.

01:14:06.775 --> 01:14:09.735
(Archie) And you come here to...
(Jed) Just hang out.

01:14:10.737 --> 01:14:13.865
- Whose are the cigarettes?
- They're not mine.

01:14:13.949 --> 01:14:16.242
- Can I just... Can I talk to you?
- This really isn't a good time.

01:14:16.368 --> 01:14:19.287
- It's not gonna take Iong. PIease?
- Okay.

01:14:19.955 --> 01:14:24.459
(Mike) I just wanted to ring this once,
just to say, I don't know...

01:14:25.127 --> 01:14:26.627
Just to say sorry.

01:14:26.712 --> 01:14:30.256
- All right.
- You know, thank you for today

01:14:30.382 --> 01:14:33.217
and for, you know, for helping me out,

01:14:33.302 --> 01:14:35.428
- and for Archie, too...
- Okay.

01:14:35.554 --> 01:14:39.223
Listen, I was really rude to him
and I didn't mean to be.

01:14:39.975 --> 01:14:42.226
He's really a decent guy.

01:14:42.728 --> 01:14:44.729
And I wish you the very best.

01:14:45.731 --> 01:14:47.106
All right.

01:14:47.441 --> 01:14:52.069
And I...
Will you do one thing for me?

01:14:52.488 --> 01:14:54.113
(policeman)
Kids, they wander in...

01:14:54.239 --> 01:14:57.742
(Mike)
Will you just apologise to Skunk for me?

01:14:57.826 --> 01:15:01.078
We've spoken to her friends.
We've spoken to all of her friends.

01:15:01.121 --> 01:15:04.624
(Mike) For all the embarrassing shit

01:15:04.750 --> 01:15:07.668
- that she's had to witness.
- (Archie) No. So my daughter...

01:15:07.753 --> 01:15:08.753
(Kasia)
Okay, Mike.

01:15:08.837 --> 01:15:11.672
...has Type 1 diabetes,
do you understand?

01:15:12.174 --> 01:15:14.008
She has Type 1 diabetes!

01:15:14.092 --> 01:15:17.261
'Cause she's a terrific kid.

01:15:17.638 --> 01:15:18.846
(Archie)
So without...

01:15:18.931 --> 01:15:20.598
- lf she doesn't stay monitored...
- Okay, now just...

01:15:20.641 --> 01:15:21.766
- No! She could die!
- Dad!

01:15:21.808 --> 01:15:23.518
Do you understand me?!

01:15:23.685 --> 01:15:26.479
(Mike) You know, and someday
she's just gonna blow us all away.

01:15:28.357 --> 01:15:29.649
Do you reckon... She's...

01:15:29.775 --> 01:15:33.694
Kasia, someday she's just gonna
blow us all away.

01:15:33.779 --> 01:15:35.613
(sobbing)

01:15:35.948 --> 01:15:37.782
(Mike)
Anyway, that's all I have to say.

01:15:40.786 --> 01:15:43.287
Yeah, you have a good Iife, yeah?

01:15:44.164 --> 01:15:46.040
(Kasia)
You too, Mike.

01:16:10.399 --> 01:16:12.400
(breathing heavily)

01:16:33.088 --> 01:16:35.506
(both breathing loudly)

01:16:45.767 --> 01:16:47.560
(shuddering)

01:17:01.450 --> 01:17:02.867
(door opens)

01:17:03.201 --> 01:17:04.201
Hi, Rick.

01:17:16.214 --> 01:17:17.590
(Skunk moans softly)

01:17:17.716 --> 01:17:19.634
Don't be scared. Don't be scared.

01:17:20.927 --> 01:17:23.471
I just want your goodness.

01:17:26.725 --> 01:17:29.310
(sobbing) I just want your goodness.

01:17:34.566 --> 01:17:36.901
(whimpers) I just want your goodness.

01:17:38.070 --> 01:17:40.237
I just want your goodness.

01:17:41.281 --> 01:17:42.948
(shuddering)

01:17:44.660 --> 01:17:45.660
(Rick sniffling)

01:18:35.669 --> 01:18:37.378
(sobbing) Shh...

01:18:45.011 --> 01:18:47.471
Stop it, please. Stop it.
You have to stop it.

01:18:48.640 --> 01:18:50.641
Please stop it. Stop it.

01:18:52.477 --> 01:18:53.728
(sobbing)

01:18:53.812 --> 01:18:55.146
No! No...

01:18:56.857 --> 01:18:58.858
No, no, no, no!

01:19:00.318 --> 01:19:02.862
No, no, no! Please!

01:19:32.851 --> 01:19:34.310
(Sunrise) Did Dad come home?

01:19:34.394 --> 01:19:35.811
(Saskia) No.

01:19:37.147 --> 01:19:39.148
(Sunrise) Where is he?

01:19:40.776 --> 01:19:42.777
(Saskia) Don't know.

01:19:46.072 --> 01:19:47.490
(sighs)

01:20:10.764 --> 01:20:12.765
Jesus Christ.

01:20:12.974 --> 01:20:15.142
(thumping)

01:20:16.019 --> 01:20:17.561
Rick?

01:20:27.280 --> 01:20:28.739
(loud thumping)

01:20:40.293 --> 01:20:41.585
(mumbling)

01:20:42.212 --> 01:20:44.213
Yeah, hello, hello.
Can I get an ambulance, please?

01:20:44.422 --> 01:20:45.714
Archie!

01:20:47.008 --> 01:20:48.676
lt's in, uh... Archie!

01:20:51.304 --> 01:20:53.472
Uh, six... 13 Drummond Close.

01:20:53.890 --> 01:20:55.474
I don't fucking know. Just...
Archie!

01:20:56.351 --> 01:21:00.646
What? I don't fucking know!
Some people have been stabbed as well.

01:21:00.730 --> 01:21:01.730
Please!

01:21:01.898 --> 01:21:04.567
Yes! Thank you. All right.

01:21:04.651 --> 01:21:07.736
(roars) Archie! Archie!

01:21:10.866 --> 01:21:13.450
Come on, darling.
Your daddy's coming.

01:21:14.119 --> 01:21:17.121
Your daddy's coming.
You're all right. You're all right.

01:21:17.330 --> 01:21:18.998
Sweetheart, sweetheart, sweetheart.
Daddy's coming.

01:21:57.078 --> 01:21:59.246
(no audio)

01:22:33.114 --> 01:22:34.531
Rick.

01:22:43.166 --> 01:22:45.042
Where's my dad?

01:22:53.176 --> 01:22:56.387
(Archie) And there were
different times in her life.

01:22:56.596 --> 01:22:58.472
Different moments.

01:22:58.556 --> 01:23:04.019
Some of them were sad,
but most of them were happy.

01:23:05.355 --> 01:23:09.525
And the woman was you.
And she was stunning.

01:23:18.618 --> 01:23:20.619
And, um...

01:23:26.876 --> 01:23:28.127
(Rick) Are you ready?

01:23:29.629 --> 01:23:31.296
What's it like there?

01:23:33.925 --> 01:23:37.177
(Archie) Then your mum woke me up and she said,

01:23:38.471 --> 01:23:41.849
"Archie, she's here."

01:23:46.563 --> 01:23:48.147
Christ.

01:23:53.069 --> 01:23:54.778
You're my...

01:23:56.698 --> 01:23:59.033
You're my girl.

01:24:03.329 --> 01:24:05.789
Come back, Skunk.

01:24:07.876 --> 01:24:09.418
Please.

01:24:11.504 --> 01:24:13.005
Shall we go?

01:24:13.673 --> 01:24:15.215
(hushed) Okay.

01:24:21.222 --> 01:24:22.765
(Archie whispers) Skunk.

01:24:27.729 --> 01:24:29.730
I'll be back in a minute.

01:24:45.830 --> 01:24:48.248
Why won't you say goodbye?

01:24:54.631 --> 01:24:57.716
Please, Dad, just... just say goodbye.

01:25:03.473 --> 01:25:04.973
(Rick) Skunk?

01:25:05.058 --> 01:25:07.059
Please.

01:25:12.482 --> 01:25:14.066
(sobbing)
