<i>&lrm;Yo, peeps, Alya here</i>

00:36.560 --> 00:38.800
<i>&lrm;bringing you</i>
<i>&lrm;the one and only Ladyblog.</i>

00:38.960 --> 00:40.560
&lrm;[she gasps]
<i>&lrm;What is that?</i>

<i>&lrm;Freak out...</i>

00:48.760 --> 00:52.760
<i>&lrm;This is no ordinary book,</i>
<i>&lrm;it's a 10th-grade history book.</i>

00:52.920 --> 00:56.080
<i>&lrm;And I should know,</i>
<i>&lrm;I've got the very same book.</i>

00:56.240 --> 00:58.720
<i>&lrm;Could Ladybug be a high-school student</i>

00:59.040 --> 01:00.520
<i>&lrm;in real life?</i>

01:00.960 --> 01:04.360
&lrm;I told you from day one, Tikki,
&lrm;I'm a total klutz.

01:04.879 --> 01:07.520
&lrm;What's done is done.
&lrm;We can't change what happened.

01:07.680 --> 01:11.720
&lrm;We can only move forward.
&lrm;Alya mustn't find out who you are.

01:11.880 --> 01:16.480
&lrm;You know how persistent she can be
&lrm;with her blog dedicated to Ladybug.

01:16.640 --> 01:17.800
&lrm;How do we get it back?

01:17.960 --> 01:20.240
&lrm;I'm not cut out for this Ladybug thing.

01:20.960 --> 01:23.040
&lrm;You are the chosen one, Marinette.

01:23.200 --> 01:25.080
&lrm;It will all work out, trust me.

01:25.240 --> 01:27.520
&lrm;Everyone has a past
&lrm;they can learn from.

01:29.360 --> 01:31.320
&lrm;This'll show you why.

01:33.960 --> 01:36.360
&lrm;An exhibition on the pharaoh Tutankhamun?

01:36.520 --> 01:38.560
&lrm;What's that got to do with Alya?

01:38.840 --> 01:41.880
&lrm;Persuade Alya to go
&lrm;and make sure she brings the book.

01:42.040 --> 01:44.560
&lrm;Tell her you found out
&lrm;something about Ladybug.

01:45.080 --> 01:47.360
&lrm;-At the museum?
&lrm;-You'll see.

01:47.760 --> 01:50.000
&lrm;I don't know
&lrm;how I'm gonna convince Alya

01:50.160 --> 01:51.920
&lrm;to go to an Egyptian exhibit

01:52.080 --> 01:54.800
&lrm;much less convince her
&lrm;that I'm not Ladybug.

01:54.960 --> 01:59.520
&lrm;She will be interested,
&lrm;and so will you. Promise.

02:04.880 --> 02:06.400
&lrm;[Alya] Can you believe it?

02:06.560 --> 02:09.360
&lrm;If I find out
&lrm;who this history book belongs to

02:09.520 --> 02:12.080
&lrm;and I figure out
&lrm;Ladybug's true identity.

02:12.240 --> 02:13.480
&lrm;I'm so on this one.

02:13.800 --> 02:16.280
&lrm;You think you can figure out
&lrm;who Ladybug is

02:16.440 --> 02:18.680
&lrm;from a book
&lrm;every high-school student owns?

02:18.840 --> 02:23.000
&lrm;Yep, ours is the only school
&lrm;that uses that book

02:23.160 --> 02:24.240
&lrm;[she yells]

02:24.400 --> 02:27.920
&lrm;All I gotta do is find out
&lrm;which girl lost her book last week.

02:29.000 --> 02:31.080
&lrm;-There are 43, not counting me.
&lrm;-42...

02:31.760 --> 02:33.640
&lrm;not counting you or me.

02:33.800 --> 02:34.880
&lrm;[she groans]

02:35.040 --> 02:38.600
&lrm;Yesterday, somebody didn't have
&lrm;her textbook in class.

02:39.040 --> 02:42.040
&lrm;I left it at home.
&lrm;You know I always forget stuff.

02:42.520 --> 02:43.880
&lrm;[questioning hum]

02:44.040 --> 02:46.520
&lrm;[she giggles]
&lrm;Just messing with you.

02:47.040 --> 02:49.320
&lrm;I'll only drop you
&lrm;from my investigation

02:49.480 --> 02:51.920
&lrm;when you bring your book to class.

02:57.160 --> 02:58.800
&lrm;[Alya yells]
&lrm;[tinkling]

02:59.720 --> 03:00.640
&lrm;It's not broken.

03:00.960 --> 03:02.880
&lrm;Hey, I'm OK too.

03:03.040 --> 03:04.440
&lrm;Thanks for asking.

03:04.720 --> 03:05.720
&lrm;[Jalil] I'm sorry.

03:06.000 --> 03:07.960
&lrm;You're in the same grade
&lrm;as Alix, right?

03:08.120 --> 03:09.640
&lrm;I'm her brother, Jalil Kubdel.

03:10.280 --> 03:12.280
&lrm;You're into Tutankhamun too?

03:12.440 --> 03:13.680
&lrm;Doc!

03:13.960 --> 03:15.200
&lrm;[sighs]
&lrm;Weird.

03:16.000 --> 03:17.920
&lrm;So, again, why are we here?

03:18.080 --> 03:20.120
&lrm;It has something to do
&lrm;with Ladybug?

03:20.720 --> 03:22.040
&lrm;-For reals?
&lrm;-Well...

03:26.600 --> 03:28.680
&lrm;Yeah, it's over there.

03:33.600 --> 03:34.720
&lrm;[she hesitates]

03:36.440 --> 03:38.920
<i>&lrm;Hang on, we're going for a ride.</i>

&lrm;[Alya gasps]
<i>&lrm;Freak out.</i>

03:41.600 --> 03:45.640
<i>&lrm;This is no ordinary book,</i>
<i>&lrm;it's a 10th-grade history book.</i>

03:45.800 --> 03:48.800
<i>&lrm;And I should know,</i>
<i>&lrm;I've got the very same book.</i>

03:48.960 --> 03:51.640
<i>&lrm;Could Ladybug be high-school student</i>

03:51.800 --> 03:52.920
<i>&lrm;in real life?</i>

03:53.080 --> 03:55.840
&lrm;What are the odds
&lrm;that we have the same textbook?

03:56.000 --> 03:57.640
&lrm;Maybe we go to the same school.

03:57.800 --> 03:59.480
&lrm;Wouldn't you know her then?

03:59.640 --> 04:02.000
&lrm;[chewing]
&lrm;Why bother yourself with ladies

04:02.160 --> 04:03.760
&lrm;when you could be enjoying this?

04:04.200 --> 04:06.880
&lrm;Ladies smell far better
&lrm;than that cheese

04:07.040 --> 04:08.600
&lrm;and they're better looking.

04:08.960 --> 04:11.240
&lrm;Suit yourself, your loss.

04:11.920 --> 04:13.880
&lrm;My only loss is my appetite.

04:15.160 --> 04:17.120
&lrm;Come on. Tell me what it is.

04:17.279 --> 04:20.720
&lrm;No, cuz it wouldn't be
&lrm;a surprise then...

04:20.880 --> 04:22.000
&lrm;To you or me.

04:24.640 --> 04:26.120
&lrm;[Jalil] I'm telling you, father,

04:26.280 --> 04:27.520
&lrm;it's in the hieroglyphics.

04:27.680 --> 04:28.760
&lrm;Excuse me.

04:28.920 --> 04:30.160
&lrm;There, as you know,

04:30.320 --> 04:32.240
&lrm;the one with the sceptre is
&lrm;Tutankhamun 1.

04:32.400 --> 04:34.560
&lrm;Opposite, is Nefertiti, his princess,

04:34.720 --> 04:36.600
&lrm;with 100 mummies beside them.

04:36.760 --> 04:38.320
&lrm;She died before him.

04:38.480 --> 04:40.880
&lrm;The Sun God, Ra,
&lrm;took her as his Goddess.

04:41.040 --> 04:42.400
&lrm;Yes, I know all that.

04:42.560 --> 04:44.960
&lrm;I'm the director
&lrm;of this exhibition, remember?

04:45.120 --> 04:47.680
&lrm;Then you know Tutankhamun wanted
&lrm;to bring her back to life

04:47.840 --> 04:50.760
&lrm;by offering the Sun God a new wife.

04:50.920 --> 04:53.080
&lrm;This illustrates a ritual he devised.

04:53.240 --> 04:56.720
&lrm;Nobody has ever deciphered it,
&lrm;but I have!

04:56.880 --> 05:00.360
&lrm;It's a magic chant
&lrm;to recite to complete the ritual.

05:00.520 --> 05:01.680
&lrm;I'm sure of it!

05:01.840 --> 05:04.680
&lrm;He reminds me of someone else
&lrm;with crazy ideas...

05:04.840 --> 05:05.960
&lrm;You!

05:06.120 --> 05:08.840
&lrm;You might think
&lrm;my Ladybug theories are crazy

05:09.000 --> 05:11.320
&lrm;but you watch, I'll prove you wrong.

05:11.720 --> 05:16.120
&lrm;Jalil, frescoes like these are
&lrm;often illustrations of a legend.

05:16.280 --> 05:18.360
&lrm;They call it a legend for a reason.

05:18.520 --> 05:20.960
&lrm;That's what everyone thinks
&lrm;but I know it's real.

05:21.120 --> 05:22.200
&lrm;I can prove it.

05:22.360 --> 05:25.080
&lrm;Really?
&lrm;How are you going to do that?

05:25.560 --> 05:27.640
&lrm;I need to get my hands on
&lrm;Tutankhamun's sceptre

05:27.800 --> 05:29.040
&lrm;and recite the spell.

05:29.200 --> 05:30.360
&lrm;Are you serious?

05:30.520 --> 05:33.960
&lrm;Don't even think of touching it.
&lrm;I'd lose my job on the spot.

05:34.120 --> 05:35.920
&lrm;It's a priceless, historical object,

05:36.080 --> 05:37.160
&lrm;not a toy.

05:37.840 --> 05:40.080
&lrm;Dad, we have to try out the spell.

05:40.240 --> 05:43.240
&lrm;What if he had found out
&lrm;how to bring people back to life?

05:43.680 --> 05:47.080
&lrm;Jalil, that's enough.
&lrm;Get your head out of those scrolls,

05:47.240 --> 05:49.520
&lrm;and focus on the real world...
&lrm;this one.

05:57.680 --> 06:00.520
&lrm;There's nothing wrong
&lrm;with living out a fantasy,

06:00.680 --> 06:03.400
&lrm;especially when
&lrm;I can make it a reality.

06:09.880 --> 06:11.640
&lrm;Fly away, my evil Akuma,

06:11.800 --> 06:14.680
&lrm;and transform that young man.

06:21.560 --> 06:22.760
&lrm;[confused sigh]

06:29.560 --> 06:30.920
&lrm;[she squeals]
&lrm;Put that down.

06:31.080 --> 06:33.760
&lrm;I'll show you what
&lrm;I found out about Ladybug.

06:34.320 --> 06:37.240
&lrm;About time.
&lrm;This better be blog worthy.

06:38.000 --> 06:41.520
&lrm;[dramatic music]

06:44.160 --> 06:45.200
&lrm;[Hawk Moth] Pharaoh,

06:45.360 --> 06:47.760
&lrm;I am Hawk Moth.

06:47.920 --> 06:51.920
&lrm;I have endowed you
&lrm;with the power of the ancient gods.

06:52.080 --> 06:55.400
&lrm;You must do me a favour
&lrm;in return for this gift.

06:56.040 --> 06:59.000
&lrm;My precious Nefertiti
&lrm;will come back to life

07:02.080 --> 07:04.280
&lrm;This thing's making my eyes hurt.

07:04.800 --> 07:06.760
&lrm;Look closely. It is in there...

07:06.920 --> 07:08.000
&lrm;[whistle]

07:08.160 --> 07:09.040
&lrm;Hey, you.

07:11.560 --> 07:13.000
&lrm;Tut, give me time.

07:15.480 --> 07:16.800
&lrm;[man whimpers]

07:17.200 --> 07:18.120
&lrm;Hey!

07:22.800 --> 07:24.240
&lrm;Alya, hide!

07:26.440 --> 07:28.200
&lrm;Get out of here, faster.

07:33.560 --> 07:34.440
&lrm;I gotta transform.

07:35.800 --> 07:37.520
&lrm;Tikki, spots on!

&lrm;I'm here before
&lrm;Ladybug or Cat Noir. It's insane.

08:00.920 --> 08:03.600
&lrm;I love the face changes.
&lrm;They'd suit you.

08:03.760 --> 08:05.120
&lrm;Time to transform.

08:23.120 --> 08:24.280
&lrm;[alarm rings]

08:25.880 --> 08:27.680
&lrm;You know that's stealing?

08:28.280 --> 08:31.040
&lrm;I'm taking back
&lrm;what rightfully belongs to me.

08:31.680 --> 08:34.799
&lrm;Maybe, if you were the real Pharaoh,
&lrm;which you're not.

08:34.960 --> 08:36.240
&lrm;Look at Ladybug go.

08:36.400 --> 08:38.760
&lrm;If I'm dreaming, don't wake me up.

08:39.440 --> 08:41.960
&lrm;Ladybug waved at me. No way.

08:46.160 --> 08:47.680

&lrm;to hold the door open.

&lrm;This is crazy. Keep your eyes peeled.

&lrm;[Pharaoh] Your face...

09:12.600 --> 09:14.520

&lrm;I can walk myself.

&lrm;[she groans]

&lrm;[Marinette] Let her go.

09:28.120 --> 09:30.160
&lrm;-You're weak.
&lrm;-I'm more powerful than you.

&lrm;Don't forget all the latest
&lrm;behind the scenes are on my blog.

&lrm;yep, that's her.

&lrm;but what exactly is going on?

10:42.840 --> 10:45.320
&lrm;I'm going to carry out the sacred spell,

10:45.480 --> 10:46.880
&lrm;to bring Nefertiti back.

10:47.440 --> 10:48.960
&lrm;Oh... gotcha.

10:49.120 --> 10:51.120
&lrm;You mean the spell on the papyrus?

10:51.480 --> 10:54.200
&lrm;Correct. The 100 mummies
&lrm;and the offering.

10:54.360 --> 10:55.480
&lrm;What offering?

10:55.880 --> 10:59.400
&lrm;To persuade the sun god Ra
&lrm;to give me back my sweet princess.

10:59.560 --> 11:02.160
&lrm;I must give a pure soul in return.

11:02.320 --> 11:04.440
&lrm;Dude, that's hard to come by.

11:04.760 --> 11:06.160
&lrm;I've already found her.

11:06.320 --> 11:08.160
&lrm;You look so much like her.

11:10.840 --> 11:12.120
&lrm;Say what?

11:12.600 --> 11:13.840
&lrm;[he cackles]

11:14.000 --> 11:14.920
&lrm;Hold on, Alya.

11:15.960 --> 11:17.120
&lrm;[she yells]

11:17.840 --> 11:21.360
&lrm;Oh no, I ran right into
&lrm;one of those time bubbles.

11:22.120 --> 11:25.600
&lrm;[slow motion]
&lrm;I've got to get out of this.

11:26.480 --> 11:27.960
&lrm;Ladybug, this is Alya.

11:28.120 --> 11:30.880
&lrm;I'm the sacrificial offering
&lrm;for the Sun God.

11:31.040 --> 11:31.920
<i>&lrm;Please hurry.</i>

11:32.400 --> 11:33.440
&lrm;Hold on, Alya.

11:34.120 --> 11:36.760
&lrm;[slow motion]
&lrm;I'm nearly there.

11:37.560 --> 11:39.040
&lrm;[Plagg] Do you really think

11:39.320 --> 11:42.440
&lrm;this mumbo jumbo with the sun
&lrm;and mummies is gonna work?

11:42.600 --> 11:43.680
&lrm;[Plagg burps]

11:43.840 --> 11:45.080
&lrm;You have no respect.

11:45.240 --> 11:46.960
&lrm;Your batteries are charged enough.

11:47.120 --> 11:48.800
&lrm;Plagg, claws out!

12:09.640 --> 12:10.680
&lrm;Thanks for waiting.

12:11.400 --> 12:12.440
&lrm;No problem.

12:12.600 --> 12:16.440
&lrm;We must find the Akuma and free it
&lrm;before he sacrifices her.

12:20.320 --> 12:22.360
&lrm;I can't see her or Pharaoh.

12:23.760 --> 12:24.800
&lrm;Over there.

12:26.080 --> 12:28.360
&lrm;[Alya struggles]

12:32.880 --> 12:33.960
&lrm;Hey, back up.

12:34.120 --> 12:38.400
&lrm;Who's that goddess chick
&lrm;with black spots on your papyrus?

12:38.560 --> 12:40.160
&lrm;Ladybug, my sworn enemy.

12:40.760 --> 12:44.640
&lrm;My nemesis kept me from carrying out
&lrm;my ritual 5000 years ago,

12:44.800 --> 12:48.320
&lrm;but she won't stop Nefertiti
&lrm;from coming back to me this time.

12:49.120 --> 12:52.280
&lrm;Did you say Ladybug
&lrm;5000 years ago?

12:52.440 --> 12:55.320
&lrm;Everyone does have a past
&lrm;they can learn from.

12:55.480 --> 12:57.880
&lrm;Well, you don't look a day over 3000.

12:58.040 --> 13:01.400
&lrm;Now you know why
&lrm;I'm so much wiser than you.

13:01.880 --> 13:02.840
&lrm;Oh sacred Ra,

13:03.000 --> 13:04.240
&lrm;God of the Sun,

13:04.840 --> 13:07.400
&lrm;I, Pharaoh, offer to thee,

13:07.560 --> 13:08.640
&lrm;a pure soul,

13:08.800 --> 13:11.440
&lrm;This sacrifice
&lrm;for the return of Nefertiti.

13:12.440 --> 13:13.720
&lrm;I bow to you

13:13.840 --> 13:16.640
&lrm;and present this gift with my mummies.

13:17.000 --> 13:20.920
&lrm;We pray to you the safe return
&lrm;of Princess Nefertiti.

13:21.080 --> 13:22.360
&lrm;Awaken, Nefertiti!

13:22.520 --> 13:23.960
&lrm;Awaken!

13:24.120 --> 13:25.880
&lrm;Awaken, Nefertiti!

13:26.040 --> 13:27.240
&lrm;Awaken!

13:27.400 --> 13:29.720
&lrm;Awaken Nefertiti.

13:30.360 --> 13:31.800
&lrm;Ladybug!

13:33.000 --> 13:34.080
&lrm;We must save her.

13:34.240 --> 13:37.680
&lrm;If he completes the ritual
&lrm;Alya will be gone, forever.

13:37.840 --> 13:39.120
&lrm;What should we do?

13:39.280 --> 13:41.160
&lrm;Hold back the mummies.
&lrm;I'll take on the Pharaoh.

13:41.320 --> 13:45.640
&lrm;Why do I have to deal with them
&lrm;while you go calmly around the back?

13:45.800 --> 13:48.400
&lrm;I'm the only one
&lrm;who can capture his Akuma.

13:48.560 --> 13:50.120
&lrm;And you're the bravest.

13:50.280 --> 13:51.400
&lrm;Sure.

13:53.440 --> 13:55.800
&lrm;I'll just pretend you really think that.

13:55.960 --> 14:00.040
&lrm;[chanting]
&lrm;Awaken, Nefertiti. Awaken.

14:00.200 --> 14:03.240
&lrm;Awaken, Nefertiti. Awaken.

14:03.400 --> 14:05.720
&lrm;Awaken, Nefertiti. Awaken.

14:05.880 --> 14:07.640
&lrm;Hey, you bunch of bandages.

14:07.800 --> 14:09.800
&lrm;Shall we wrap this up?

14:09.960 --> 14:10.880
&lrm;Cat Noir!

14:11.520 --> 14:12.680
&lrm;Seize him!

14:14.600 --> 14:16.800
&lrm;Is that really as fast as you can go?

14:16.960 --> 14:18.440
&lrm;[mummies groan]

14:19.000 --> 14:21.760
&lrm;Wait, this looks like a trap!

14:27.760 --> 14:28.840
&lrm;Gotcha.

14:29.280 --> 14:31.320
&lrm;Horus, give me your wings!

14:32.720 --> 14:34.680
&lrm;[dramatic music]

14:35.160 --> 14:37.760
&lrm;[bleep]
&lrm;Peeps, you've just witnessed

14:37.920 --> 14:40.520
&lrm;another feat from Ladybug.
&lrm;Thanks for saving me.

14:41.200 --> 14:44.400
&lrm;Oh, you're welcome,
&lrm;but it's not over yet, not until...

14:44.560 --> 14:47.880
&lrm;Not until Ladybug destroys
&lrm;the pendant with the Akuma,

14:48.040 --> 14:51.040
&lrm;and turns everything back to normal.
&lrm;I pay attention.

14:51.200 --> 14:53.920
&lrm;[she gasps]
&lrm;The pendant... Good eye.

14:54.080 --> 14:55.280
&lrm;[Ayla screams]

14:55.440 --> 14:56.840
&lrm;[he roars]

14:59.960 --> 15:01.080
&lrm;[sigh of relief]

15:01.240 --> 15:02.280
&lrm;Way to go, Ladybug!

15:05.760 --> 15:06.760
&lrm;No!

15:08.520 --> 15:11.200
&lrm;You're not going to win
&lrm;this time, Ladybug!

15:11.640 --> 15:12.880
&lrm;Help me, Ladybug!

15:13.040 --> 15:14.480
&lrm;Crush that insect!

15:22.160 --> 15:24.160
&lrm;[Alya yells]

15:28.320 --> 15:29.160
&lrm;What the...

15:34.080 --> 15:36.000
&lrm;Cat Noir, this way.

15:46.600 --> 15:47.960
&lrm;[Cat Noir giggles]

15:48.760 --> 15:52.400
&lrm;We have to save Alya before
&lrm;she reaches the circle of darkness.

15:52.840 --> 15:54.400
&lrm;[Pharaoh] You won't stop me

15:54.560 --> 15:57.360
&lrm;from bringing Nefertiti back.
&lrm;I'll finish you.

15:57.520 --> 15:59.440
&lrm;Anubis, bring me mummies!

16:09.320 --> 16:11.880
&lrm;Horus, give me your wings!

16:12.280 --> 16:15.360
&lrm;[yelling]

16:19.000 --> 16:21.120
&lrm;[Pharaoh cackles]
&lrm;[Ladybug screams]

16:24.720 --> 16:28.320
&lrm;Cat Noir, the pendant.
&lrm;That's where the Akuma is.

16:33.880 --> 16:36.240
&lrm;Sekhmet, give me your strength!

16:38.320 --> 16:39.840
&lrm;[yelling]

16:45.160 --> 16:47.040
&lrm;It's over.

16:47.560 --> 16:49.520
&lrm;Ladybug, save me!

16:50.000 --> 16:52.680
&lrm;Ra, God of the Sun,

16:52.840 --> 16:56.640
&lrm;accept this humble offering
&lrm;and return the princess to me!

16:57.200 --> 16:58.840
&lrm;Lucky charm!

17:02.880 --> 17:04.839
&lrm;A Ladybug outfit?

17:05.000 --> 17:06.520
&lrm;That's our last hope?

17:06.680 --> 17:08.280
&lrm;[questioning sigh]

17:09.920 --> 17:12.520
&lrm;This offering isn't good enough
&lrm;for Nefertiti.

17:12.839 --> 17:14.640
&lrm;Hey, thanks a lot.

17:14.800 --> 17:17.440
&lrm;Too late, Ladybug,
&lrm;the ritual has begun.

17:17.599 --> 17:20.359
&lrm;Set Alya free
&lrm;and sacrifice me instead.

17:20.520 --> 17:23.640
&lrm;Wouldn't that be the sweetest
&lrm;revenge 5000 years later?

17:23.800 --> 17:26.920
&lrm;I'm the one who kept
&lrm;Nefertiti from you all these years.

17:27.359 --> 17:30.560
&lrm;It's true that you'd make
&lrm;a much more precious offering

17:30.720 --> 17:32.440
&lrm;than this mortal.

17:33.840 --> 17:36.520
&lrm;Horus, give me wings!

17:39.560 --> 17:40.880
&lrm;Seriously?

17:44.760 --> 17:49.120
&lrm;Excuse you, but I make
&lrm;excellent sacrificing material.

17:51.160 --> 17:52.960
&lrm;Take her Miraculous, the earrings!

17:54.560 --> 17:55.920
&lrm;You win, Pharaoh.

17:59.480 --> 18:00.480
&lrm;[he gasps]

18:00.760 --> 18:02.200
&lrm;You want my Miraculous?

18:02.360 --> 18:04.240
&lrm;-Go get it.
&lrm;-Get it!

18:10.240 --> 18:11.320
&lrm;[tinkling]
&lrm;A toy?

18:11.480 --> 18:12.720
&lrm;You tricked me!

18:19.600 --> 18:21.960
&lrm;No more evil-doing for you,
&lrm;little Akuma.

18:25.240 --> 18:27.280
&lrm;Time to de-evilise!

18:30.960 --> 18:32.000
&lrm;Gotcha!

18:33.400 --> 18:35.120
&lrm;Bye-bye, little butterfly.

18:35.680 --> 18:37.440
&lrm;Miraculous Ladybug!

18:48.840 --> 18:50.560
&lrm;What happened?

18:52.800 --> 18:54.200
&lrm;Thanks, Ladybug,

18:54.360 --> 18:57.520
&lrm;but I still gotta ask
&lrm;how old are you really?

18:57.680 --> 19:01.040
&lrm;Much older than a high-school
&lrm;student, that's for sure.

19:03.920 --> 19:05.840
&lrm;Don't you wanna know
&lrm;how old I am?

19:06.000 --> 19:07.760
&lrm;In a sec, it looks like

19:07.920 --> 19:09.440
&lrm;I'll find out for myself.

19:09.600 --> 19:10.600
&lrm;[he gasps]

19:12.360 --> 19:15.040
&lrm;[Alya giggles]

19:18.480 --> 19:20.080
&lrm;[Alya] Where have you been?

19:20.240 --> 19:23.000
&lrm;You won't believe this,
&lrm;I got mummified.

19:23.160 --> 19:26.600
&lrm;Hope you weren't trying
&lrm;to swap me for Nefertiti. Creepy.

19:26.760 --> 19:28.920
&lrm;What? You were almost sacrificed?

19:29.080 --> 19:31.120
&lrm;Without you, I'd never have found out

19:31.280 --> 19:33.040
&lrm;that Ladybug's 5000 years old.

19:33.840 --> 19:35.920
&lrm;Hey, what are friends for?

19:36.680 --> 19:38.040
&lrm;[Alya] I still don't get it.

19:38.200 --> 19:40.760
&lrm;Why did she have
&lrm;a 10th-grade history book?

19:40.920 --> 19:43.720
&lrm;[hesitantly]
&lrm;She... She probably had to find out

19:43.880 --> 19:46.560
&lrm;what's been going on
&lrm;for the past 50 centuries.

19:46.720 --> 19:50.160
&lrm;You're probably right.
&lrm;It's tough staying in the loop.

19:51.480 --> 19:54.040
&lrm;Hey, Ladybug's textbook, it's gone.

19:54.680 --> 19:56.400
&lrm;[Marinette giggles]

19:56.560 --> 20:00.520
&lrm;You might have gotten away this time
&lrm;but I assure you, Ladybug,

20:00.680 --> 20:05.120
&lrm;someday, wherever you are,
&lrm;I will have your Miraculous,

20:05.280 --> 20:08.480
&lrm;and you'll be nothing,
&lrm;nothing at all!

20:12.440 --> 20:15.560
&lrm;I don't get it.
&lrm;I know I'm not 5000 years old.

20:15.720 --> 20:18.720
&lrm;So who exactly was
&lrm;that Ladybug in the papyrus?

20:18.880 --> 20:22.680
&lrm;Kwamis like me and superheroes
&lrm;like you have always existed.

20:22.840 --> 20:25.800
&lrm;So that wasn't you
&lrm;on the papyrus, either?

20:26.240 --> 20:29.640
&lrm;-What do you think?
&lrm;-You don't look 5000 years old.

20:29.800 --> 20:33.320
&lrm;[Tikki chuckles]
&lrm;Well, I'm not. I'm older than that.

20:33.480 --> 20:37.560
&lrm;I'm the Kwami who has watched over
&lrm;every Ladybug since the beginning.

20:37.720 --> 20:41.400
&lrm;You must have known much less klutzy
&lrm;Ladybugs than me, right?

20:41.560 --> 20:43.280
&lrm;Every Ladybug is different.

20:43.440 --> 20:45.240
&lrm;[sadly]
&lrm;Yeah, that's what I thought.

20:45.400 --> 20:46.960
&lrm;Marinette, you are different,

20:47.120 --> 20:50.840
&lrm;but different as in surprising,
&lrm;unpredictable and endearing,

20:51.000 --> 20:52.520
&lrm;and very talented.

20:52.680 --> 20:54.360
&lrm;-You learn fast.
&lrm;-Really?

20:54.520 --> 20:56.160
&lrm;Yes.

20:58.720 --> 21:00.280
&lrm;[they giggle]

21:00.440 --> 21:04.240
<i>&lrm;You'd better get to sleep.</i>
<i>&lrm;You have that history test tomorrow.</i>

21:04.400 --> 21:07.200
<i>&lrm;Oh yeah,</i>
<i>&lrm;good thing it's on Ancient Egypt.</i>

21:08.160 --> 21:11.760
&lrm;[lively music]
