WEBVTT

02:01.329 --> 02:02.705
I can't stay for long.

02:03.873 --> 02:04.791
Where are the girls?

02:18.972 --> 02:20.765
They tried to wait for you,
but didn't make it.

02:20.932 --> 02:22.183
What time do they wake up?

02:22.267 --> 02:23.726
At six. Like clockwork.

02:25.311 --> 02:26.146
Stay.

02:27.522 --> 02:28.731
Everyone is on my trail.

02:29.107 --> 02:31.484
Fucking traitorous government
turned its back on me.

02:32.569 --> 02:34.696
They'll go after me wherever I am.

02:35.738 --> 02:36.656
What's going to happen?

02:37.824 --> 02:39.576
I need to disappear for a while.

02:40.285 --> 02:41.119
For how long?

02:43.163 --> 02:44.164
Where will you go?

02:44.622 --> 02:45.456
I don't know.

02:46.666 --> 02:47.542
But you'll hear from me.

02:55.383 --> 02:57.594
I couldn't leave without saying
goodbye to you three.

03:05.768 --> 03:08.146
We always come out on top,
even at the worst times, right?

03:34.339 --> 03:38.509
I feel the warmth
from my boiling blood

03:38.801 --> 03:43.014
I feel the fear, sweat dripping away

03:43.223 --> 03:47.518
There's a stillness
that nothing transmits

03:47.644 --> 03:53.650
I'm a breeze
that grows stronger

03:54.317 --> 03:57.445
Even when the clouds drift away

03:58.613 --> 04:02.116
Even when my skin dries away

04:02.742 --> 04:06.746
I'll be back someday

04:07.497 --> 04:11.793
To unleash my return

04:15.797 --> 04:19.842
I have the dust
that protects the road

04:20.218 --> 04:24.681
I have the branches
of a leafless tree

04:24.764 --> 04:28.893
I'm the guardian of the tired night

04:29.227 --> 04:35.233
There are silhouettes that
come to meet me

04:35.692 --> 04:39.112
Even when the clouds drift away

04:40.029 --> 04:43.533
Even when my skin dries away

04:44.033 --> 04:48.121
I'll be back someday

04:48.913 --> 04:53.418
To unleash my return

04:57.380 --> 05:00.258
MIRAMAR BUILDING
MAZATLÁN, MEXICO

05:01.175 --> 05:04.012
FEBRUARY 22, 2014
5:40 AM

05:52.185 --> 05:53.269
Don't shoot.

05:55.396 --> 05:56.606
What do you want?

06:06.949 --> 06:09.077
I'm alone!
There's no one else, I swear!

06:14.207 --> 06:15.124
Let me go!

06:27.929 --> 06:30.264
Let me go!
I want to see my daughters!

06:36.854 --> 06:37.730
Chapo!

06:38.147 --> 06:39.023
Surrender!

06:41.776 --> 06:44.695
Let me go!
I want to see my daughters!

06:45.488 --> 06:47.031
That's enough, Chapo!

06:50.159 --> 06:51.744
Do you want your family?

06:52.036 --> 06:53.162
Give yourself up!

07:00.586 --> 07:04.423
My girls, my girls! Let me go!

07:22.316 --> 07:23.192
OK, OK.

07:23.276 --> 07:24.652
Do you have him?

07:24.735 --> 07:25.611
Negative. Not yet.

07:45.214 --> 07:46.215
Hold him, hold him!

07:48.551 --> 07:49.635
Hands up!

07:50.178 --> 07:51.554
Hands up!

07:52.763 --> 07:53.806
Head down!

07:57.059 --> 07:58.102
Head down!

08:00.855 --> 08:04.233
Let me go!
I want to see my daughters!

08:08.738 --> 08:10.531
Go, go! Let's go, let's go!

09:14.971 --> 09:15.846
Have you seen him?

09:16.597 --> 09:17.890
Not yet, Mr. President.

09:19.725 --> 09:20.810
At any moment now, though.

09:27.400 --> 09:28.317
Conrado.

09:30.611 --> 09:31.445
Everything's all right.

09:32.989 --> 09:33.823
He's here.

09:35.575 --> 09:36.409
And the press?

09:37.660 --> 09:38.619
Don't worry about it.

09:40.288 --> 09:41.414
The world will see it.

10:12.820 --> 10:13.696
How do you feel?

10:13.821 --> 10:14.697
Excuse me?

10:14.947 --> 10:15.823
How do you feel?

10:16.532 --> 10:17.366
Fine, fine.

10:27.960 --> 10:29.128
When you got away from us in Culiacan,

10:29.211 --> 10:30.504
we thought that you'd go further away.

10:30.921 --> 10:32.048
Why did you stay in Mazatlán?

10:34.383 --> 10:35.509
I was about to go
to the mountains.

10:38.387 --> 10:39.597
I hadn't seen my children.

10:40.181 --> 10:41.057
Thanks.

10:41.807 --> 10:43.601
Don't worry about them, sir.
They will be fine.

10:43.934 --> 10:45.895
And your wife's arrest
was merely routine.

10:45.978 --> 10:46.812
She's already free.

10:47.521 --> 10:48.397
Do you want to talk with her?

10:50.232 --> 10:51.150
Is that possible?

10:51.233 --> 10:52.151
Everything's possible here.

10:52.234 --> 10:53.277
Except leaving.

10:56.447 --> 10:57.323
You have one minute.

11:00.618 --> 11:02.244
Where are you going, girl?

11:02.411 --> 11:04.538
Almoloya. They'll probably
take him there.

11:15.257 --> 11:16.175
Hello?

11:16.550 --> 11:17.593
Sweetie.

11:23.682 --> 11:25.351
How are you?

11:25.893 --> 11:26.936
Fine. I'm already in Culiacan.

11:28.729 --> 11:29.605
And the girls?

11:30.898 --> 11:32.274
Fine, don't worry.

11:33.734 --> 11:35.069
Where are you calling from?

11:36.070 --> 11:37.613
Everything will be fine, sweetie.

11:39.990 --> 11:41.158
I love you all very much.

11:41.242 --> 11:42.201
We will see each other soon.

11:42.326 --> 11:43.202
Where are they taking you?

11:50.084 --> 11:51.794
We are live in the Marine hangar

11:51.877 --> 11:54.797
at the airport in Mexico City,

11:54.880 --> 11:56.549
where the Secretary of State

11:56.632 --> 12:00.177
will give out details about
Chapo's capture.

12:00.261 --> 12:02.263
With Efficiency,

12:02.847 --> 12:05.015
and without firing a single shot,

12:05.099 --> 12:07.560
Marine forces managed to arrest

12:07.643 --> 12:08.644
Chapo Guzman.

12:25.619 --> 12:27.288
There weren't any damages

12:28.122 --> 12:30.166
or a single injury.

12:32.501 --> 12:33.419
That's all.

12:33.919 --> 12:35.129
Thank you.

12:44.847 --> 12:47.475
At this moment,
Joaquin "El Chapo" Guzman

12:47.558 --> 12:50.644
is being taken out of the Marine's
hangar and shown to the press.

12:52.354 --> 12:54.648
After 13 years as a fugitive,

12:54.732 --> 12:57.735
this is the face of the world's
most wanted drug lord.

13:01.322 --> 13:02.823
According to the authorities,

13:02.990 --> 13:06.577
El Chapo will be transferred
to the Altiplano Supermax,

13:06.869 --> 13:09.288
the very same prison
that took him in 21 years ago

13:09.705 --> 13:11.874
and from where no one has ever escaped.

13:16.962 --> 13:20.299
There, he will await what seems
to be his destiny...

13:20.758 --> 13:21.926
extradition.

13:41.904 --> 13:44.490
ALTIPLANO PRISON
ALMOLOYA DE JUAREZ, MEXICO

14:34.373 --> 14:36.041
You don't have a name anymore!

14:36.500 --> 14:38.210
You are not a person anymore!

14:38.961 --> 14:39.920
You are a number!

14:40.087 --> 14:42.840
From now on, you will be 3578.

14:43.257 --> 14:44.383
That's what you will be called.

14:44.508 --> 14:46.176
And that's what you will answer to.

14:46.302 --> 14:47.177
Understood?

14:47.261 --> 14:48.137
Yes, sir.

14:48.470 --> 14:49.805
Answer respectfully.

14:49.889 --> 14:50.848
Yes, sir!

14:53.684 --> 14:55.519
CULIACAN, MEXICO

14:56.478 --> 14:58.188
ISMAEL ZAMBRANO'S HOME

15:02.067 --> 15:03.402
Did you manage to get in touch
with my dad?

15:04.069 --> 15:06.280
They haven't let our lawyers
anywhere near him.

15:06.363 --> 15:07.239
What are we going to do?

15:08.240 --> 15:09.700
After Joaquin's arrest, we are weakened

15:09.783 --> 15:10.701
in the eyes of the government.

15:11.410 --> 15:12.620
They'll come for us.

15:13.037 --> 15:14.038
Let them come. We'll be waiting.

15:14.121 --> 15:15.080
Keep a cool head, Quino.

15:18.542 --> 15:20.044
Joaquin is the most notorious among us

15:20.127 --> 15:21.337
and the DEA had their eye on him.

15:22.630 --> 15:24.423
It was in the government's
best interest to arrest him.

15:24.882 --> 15:27.426
The president can show off
his capture to the whole world.

15:28.093 --> 15:29.678
What we need to do is plan

15:30.054 --> 15:31.639
on how to continue by ourselves.

15:32.014 --> 15:32.848
What do we do?

15:34.558 --> 15:36.143
Who will make Joaquin's decisions?

15:37.311 --> 15:39.730
All decisions will be made here,
between us.

15:42.399 --> 15:43.233
OK?

15:47.321 --> 15:48.280
Sounds good to me.

15:48.781 --> 15:51.075
I know we need to keep
the business up, for everyone.

15:53.243 --> 15:56.121
MEXICO CITY

16:18.227 --> 16:19.228
Cheers.

16:19.311 --> 16:20.187
Cheers.

16:23.065 --> 16:26.068
I want to thank
the support that you,

16:26.151 --> 16:29.196
and your government, have
offered us during this operation.

16:29.738 --> 16:32.282
And I assure you, by the honor
of the Mexican people,

16:32.700 --> 16:34.159
that Guzman Loera will face

16:34.243 --> 16:36.036
the full weight of the law.

16:36.954 --> 16:39.373
We'll punctually meet every step required

16:39.456 --> 16:41.041
for his extradition.

16:41.750 --> 16:44.253
Respecting the due process
at every moment

16:44.336 --> 16:46.296
as well as his human rights.

16:47.423 --> 16:48.632
Thank you. Cheers!

16:51.719 --> 16:53.595
You are gonna die here, Chapo.

16:58.809 --> 16:59.977
Or even worse,

17:00.769 --> 17:02.229
you'll be extradited.

17:03.564 --> 17:05.107
You are fucked for good.

17:05.190 --> 17:06.400
Silence! Who's talking?

17:06.483 --> 17:07.484
"LA MUÑECA"
ARTURO BERNAL LEYDA'S LIEUTENANT

17:13.198 --> 17:14.324
3578,

17:14.908 --> 17:16.702
you know the rules very well.

17:17.286 --> 17:18.120
Yes, sir.

17:18.871 --> 17:21.123
And that's why I request
permission to speak.

17:21.707 --> 17:22.583
Speak.

17:22.666 --> 17:25.335
I haven't been allowed
to contact my lawyers yet.

17:26.670 --> 17:28.422
And I have that right.

17:29.006 --> 17:31.383
That's not going to happen.
Orders from above.

17:31.800 --> 17:32.760
From the warden?

17:33.510 --> 17:34.845
Allow me to talk with him.

17:35.262 --> 17:37.973
The warden will talk with you
whenever he decides to.

17:38.265 --> 17:39.725
Don't waste your time, 3578.

17:40.184 --> 17:42.102
The orders come from somewhere higher.

17:46.565 --> 17:47.441
Lights out!

17:49.651 --> 17:51.070
Fucking gringos...

17:51.737 --> 17:52.821
They want everything.

17:53.655 --> 17:55.240
We can't extradite him.

17:55.574 --> 17:56.742
He knows too much.

17:57.451 --> 17:59.870
If we hand him over,
he could speak about the party.

18:01.038 --> 18:01.997
But here...

18:04.249 --> 18:06.043
we could always silence him.

18:07.377 --> 18:08.962
What can the gringos do if they find out

18:09.046 --> 18:10.047
that we don't want to give him up?

18:10.422 --> 18:12.633
Threaten with stopping subsidies,

18:14.301 --> 18:15.552
cutting funds,

18:16.220 --> 18:18.055
press us with closing Plan Merida.

18:19.807 --> 18:21.517
They'll need to settle
for his arrest.

18:22.643 --> 18:26.021
The DEA came, celebrated.
Everyone's happy and satisfied.

18:26.105 --> 18:28.482
We need to stall the extradition order,

18:29.274 --> 18:32.152
approve every appeal from his lawyers.

18:36.532 --> 18:37.366
I'll take care of that.

18:45.958 --> 18:47.084
Berta,

18:47.251 --> 18:48.335
we had something real.

18:49.253 --> 18:51.839
People spend their whole lives
searching for what we had.

18:51.922 --> 18:52.965
Had, Miguel.

18:53.632 --> 18:54.591
We don't have it anymore.

18:54.842 --> 18:57.136
But we can still count
on each other, right?

18:58.470 --> 18:59.346
Always.

19:00.514 --> 19:01.849
When love is real,

19:03.058 --> 19:04.476
you never forget that person.

19:05.811 --> 19:06.895
Maybe,

19:08.355 --> 19:10.107
but I'm after something else right now.

19:10.816 --> 19:12.192
And I get closer every day.

19:15.863 --> 19:17.656
All of it is about
to take off, Miguel.

19:21.326 --> 19:22.661
There will be time for the rest.

19:33.881 --> 19:34.840
Good evening.

19:35.090 --> 19:36.258
How was dinner?

19:36.842 --> 19:37.718
Fine.

19:38.343 --> 19:39.386
You know,

19:39.845 --> 19:40.971
DEA pressuring us.

19:41.847 --> 19:43.015
Nothing we didn't expect.

19:44.683 --> 19:45.642
Conrado.

19:47.936 --> 19:50.189
Do you think that people
never forget those they love?

19:54.818 --> 19:55.944
Are you talking about your ex?

19:56.778 --> 19:57.613
No.

19:58.280 --> 19:59.740
I'm thinking about that boy,

20:00.490 --> 20:01.867
the one you left for this.

20:04.995 --> 20:05.829
Did you love him?

20:08.582 --> 20:09.416
No.

20:12.127 --> 20:13.086
Don't you miss him?

20:15.422 --> 20:16.715
You really forgot about him?

20:20.177 --> 20:21.720
It was just another fling, Berta.

20:23.597 --> 20:25.057
Some boy I knew.

20:27.476 --> 20:28.310
Good night.

20:48.956 --> 20:49.831
I want to see you.

20:52.376 --> 20:53.252
Come.

20:54.753 --> 20:56.421
I can't. It's too risky.

20:59.132 --> 21:00.133
Be patient.

21:01.343 --> 21:03.387
I'll find a safe way to meet.

21:06.431 --> 21:07.474
I'll call you.

21:14.606 --> 21:15.816
You got 20 minutes.

21:29.037 --> 21:30.956
MARTIN CAMPOS
ALTIPLANO PRISON WARDEN

21:35.836 --> 21:36.670
Is he alone?

21:37.504 --> 21:38.714
Yes, Mister Secretary.

21:39.006 --> 21:40.882
He can't share the yard with anyone else.

21:41.216 --> 21:42.884
Has he had any contact with his lawyers?

21:42.968 --> 21:45.095
No. We are following your directions

21:45.178 --> 21:46.430
to the T.

21:47.097 --> 21:48.724
No visits, no calls.

21:49.558 --> 21:50.600
Keep an eye on him.

21:51.893 --> 21:53.812
Knowing Chapo,
he must be planning something.

22:36.938 --> 22:38.356
What is happening, Valdovinos?

22:39.900 --> 22:41.318
How long will we have to wait?

22:42.527 --> 22:44.237
They have to let him talk to his lawyers.

22:44.446 --> 22:47.074
The order comes directly from
the Secretary of the Interior.

22:47.449 --> 22:49.201
He instructed the prison's warden

22:49.493 --> 22:50.827
not to let him see us.

22:51.411 --> 22:53.121
They called it a special case

22:53.830 --> 22:57.084
because he once escaped from a Supermax.

22:59.211 --> 23:01.421
We can't just wait.

23:03.507 --> 23:04.674
What do you propose?

23:06.802 --> 23:08.220
Appeal to those who love him.

23:28.657 --> 23:29.574
Muñeca?

23:29.991 --> 23:31.785
The food got you sick, right?

23:33.078 --> 23:34.830
Wouldn't you want to have decent food

23:34.913 --> 23:36.039
and medical care?

23:37.707 --> 23:39.334
They can't keep us like this, man.

23:39.501 --> 23:41.128
No one cares about you here, Chapo.

23:41.795 --> 23:43.338
You might have been a king out there,

23:43.713 --> 23:45.423
but here, you're a piece of shit.

23:46.716 --> 23:48.260
That's why we need
to attack them from the outside.

23:49.302 --> 23:50.637
I don't have access to my lawyers,

23:50.720 --> 23:51.972
but you do.

23:54.516 --> 23:55.767
I'm not going to eat this trash anymore.

23:55.934 --> 23:57.978
-It's rotten!
-Silence, 3578.

23:58.186 --> 23:59.062
Sit down.

24:00.605 --> 24:02.190
I won't eat it either.

24:02.858 --> 24:03.692
I'm on a hunger strike

24:03.775 --> 24:05.777
until the government treats us
with dignity and respect.

24:07.279 --> 24:08.780
They can't give us rotten food.

24:09.865 --> 24:11.491
Or deny us medical care.

24:12.450 --> 24:14.369
Feel welcome to join.

24:15.078 --> 24:15.912
Hey! What the hell?

24:21.459 --> 24:22.294
Silence!

24:23.503 --> 24:24.796
Sit down!

24:27.382 --> 24:28.383
-Hit me, too!
-Sit down!

24:29.843 --> 24:31.052
Give up the hunger strike,

24:31.720 --> 24:33.346
or you'll end up in deeper trouble.

24:34.639 --> 24:36.016
We are only asking for the basics.

24:36.266 --> 24:38.393
Decent food, medical care,

24:38.643 --> 24:40.228
and access to our lawyers.

24:40.395 --> 24:42.522
The press already knows
and they'll go after you.

24:43.148 --> 24:45.567
Joaquin and Muñeca's
strike worked.

24:46.318 --> 24:48.403
The media is asking for

24:48.528 --> 24:49.613
every lawyer's statements.

24:49.696 --> 24:51.489
We'll hit the president
where it hurts him the most:

24:51.573 --> 24:52.407
his public image.

24:53.992 --> 24:56.244
We have a surprise for him
in Culiacan, too.

24:59.706 --> 25:01.291
The Sinaloa Cartel boss

25:01.750 --> 25:03.293
will face charges in Mexico

25:03.376 --> 25:05.754
before any chance of being extradited.

25:06.338 --> 25:08.381
Nevertheless, hundreds of protesters

25:08.506 --> 25:10.842
left their homes in Culiacan to demand

25:10.926 --> 25:12.719
Chapo Guzman's release.

25:13.428 --> 25:16.264
Men, women and children
attended after being

25:16.348 --> 25:18.308
anonymously summoned through social media

25:18.433 --> 25:21.770
to march in favor of the famous drug lord

25:21.853 --> 25:23.563
and oppose his extradition.

25:25.523 --> 25:27.734
Some of them arrived
on private buses.

25:30.195 --> 25:32.739
Chapo forever! 701 forever!

25:32.822 --> 25:34.449
Long live Badiraguato!

25:34.866 --> 25:36.076
Protesters showed up

25:36.159 --> 25:37.994
at other municipalities as well,

25:38.203 --> 25:41.790
with messages supporting Chapo
written on signs and shirts.

25:41.873 --> 25:42.874
WE WANT EL CHAPO FREE

25:42.958 --> 25:45.085
Meanwhile, in Mexico City,

25:45.168 --> 25:46.753
Chapo Guzman's lawyers

25:46.962 --> 25:49.422
are about to talk about the hunger strike

25:49.547 --> 25:52.300
started by their client
at the Altiplano prison.

25:52.676 --> 25:53.927
Valdovinos!

25:54.302 --> 25:55.553
Would you leave me alone, please?

25:55.637 --> 25:56.972
We'd like to inform the press

25:57.222 --> 25:59.599
that over 1,000 inmates have joined

25:59.683 --> 26:00.767
the hunger strike

26:00.976 --> 26:03.144
to protest the awful conditions

26:03.228 --> 26:04.688
they endure at the prison.

26:04.896 --> 26:06.940
There are no guarantees today

26:07.482 --> 26:10.819
that any inmate can survive there.

26:11.569 --> 26:13.697
That isn't the proper way
to treat anyone in Mexico.

26:14.197 --> 26:18.868
That's why we have called on international
human rights organizations

26:19.202 --> 26:22.414
to visit the prison and speak about it.

26:22.956 --> 26:25.250
But the main question is:

26:26.751 --> 26:27.877
Mr. President,

26:28.753 --> 26:30.088
are you aware of the fact

26:30.463 --> 26:32.173
that in Mexican prisons,

26:32.424 --> 26:34.175
human rights are being violated?

26:35.593 --> 26:38.388
The eyes of the world
are on you, Mr. President.

26:42.517 --> 26:43.685
Hello?

26:43.977 --> 26:44.894
What the fuck is happening?

26:44.978 --> 26:45.895
This is outrageous.

26:48.773 --> 26:51.526
They want to hurt your image,
Mr. President.

26:52.235 --> 26:53.528
Let's issue a press release.

26:54.321 --> 26:55.238
And what do we say?

26:55.363 --> 26:57.240
That we agree with the inmates' demands.

26:57.615 --> 26:58.992
Are you crazy, Conrado?

26:59.242 --> 27:00.660
That's the best course of action, sir.

27:01.453 --> 27:05.165
We give into the demands because we have

27:05.915 --> 27:09.085
a principled, humane,
compassionate president.

27:09.169 --> 27:10.920
Not a tyrant who abuses his prisoners.

27:12.255 --> 27:15.008
A president who respects human rights.

27:17.635 --> 27:18.553
Very well. Take care of it.

27:22.766 --> 27:24.726
Martin, we're going to
give them what they want.

27:26.102 --> 27:27.062
But be on your guard.

27:28.188 --> 27:29.981
I'm sure El Chapo is plotting something.

27:30.774 --> 27:32.192
I don't believe he started the strike

27:32.275 --> 27:34.319
out of concern
for the prison's conditions.

27:34.569 --> 27:37.155
Do not worry, sir.
We'll keep an eye on him.

27:45.580 --> 27:47.499
Francisca, I'll be unavailable
for 15 minutes.

28:15.443 --> 28:16.861
Excuse me, a question.

28:16.986 --> 28:19.239
Is there always this much movement?

28:19.322 --> 28:22.367
Yes, sir. This is the shift change.
It's done twice a day.

28:23.326 --> 28:24.411
Thank you.

28:37.090 --> 28:38.550
I know how we can see each other.

29:54.167 --> 29:55.710
Don't worry, son.

29:56.961 --> 29:57.921
It's just old age.

30:00.465 --> 30:02.509
Your mom is so worried, she doesn't sleep.

30:09.724 --> 30:11.267
What do you worry about, Mom?

30:11.601 --> 30:12.602
Everything will be fine.

30:13.102 --> 30:14.687
How could I not worry?

30:15.522 --> 30:17.524
I don't know whether you'll be
sent to the other side,

30:17.774 --> 30:18.817
or killed.

30:18.900 --> 30:19.818
That won't happen.

30:20.235 --> 30:21.778
You know I'm immortal.

30:24.864 --> 30:25.698
And the girls?

30:26.115 --> 30:26.950
Fine.

30:27.867 --> 30:29.035
Look what they made for you.

30:36.668 --> 30:38.670
Valdovinos? I have an assignment for you.

30:41.256 --> 30:43.132
We need to thank
the captain for the operation.

30:44.342 --> 30:46.052
Send him a carton of cold beer.

30:56.938 --> 31:02.068
YOU HAVE A NICE FAMILY, WARDEN.
KEEP YOUR EARS OPEN TOMORROW.

31:29.095 --> 31:31.639
MEXICO CITY

31:59.500 --> 32:01.002
Francisca, I'm not available for anyone.

32:01.419 --> 32:02.712
I'm going to eat with my wife.

32:03.087 --> 32:05.465
Yes, Mr. Secretary.

33:40.768 --> 33:41.644
Hi, Francisca.

33:41.978 --> 33:42.854
And my husband?

33:43.104 --> 33:44.897
He already left, ma'am.

33:45.064 --> 33:46.441
He said he was going to lunch with you.

33:47.483 --> 33:49.652
I figured you'd meet at the restaurant.

33:50.653 --> 33:51.529
Do you want me to call him?

33:51.738 --> 33:53.281
No. It's fine.

33:53.406 --> 33:54.699
I probably got it wrong.

33:55.158 --> 33:55.992
Thanks.

34:23.186 --> 34:24.520
Will we meet here from now on?

34:24.979 --> 34:25.813
No.

34:26.230 --> 34:28.399
We'll use a different apartment
every time.

34:29.192 --> 34:30.193
I'll get it.

34:31.903 --> 34:33.571
You will receive a text
with the address here.

34:34.530 --> 34:35.782
Use it only for that.

34:36.657 --> 34:38.701
Don't store any number
and don't make calls.

34:39.911 --> 34:41.621
We'll switch the SIM card
after each encounter.

34:44.499 --> 34:45.958
These are security protocols.

34:48.252 --> 34:49.253
I learned them from Joaquin.

34:50.588 --> 34:52.215
What if I want to see you?
How do I contact you?

34:53.257 --> 34:54.175
That can't happen.

34:55.468 --> 34:57.136
We'll only meet whenever I can.

35:02.433 --> 35:03.309
What's wrong?

35:04.727 --> 35:06.229
I'm not sure I want to live like that.

35:07.271 --> 35:08.815
Paranoid, hidden.

35:09.398 --> 35:10.942
That's the only way, Sebastian.

35:13.861 --> 35:15.488
Each time we see each other,
I'm risking everything

35:15.571 --> 35:16.614
I've worked for.

35:20.660 --> 35:21.494
What about me?

35:22.870 --> 35:24.247
What will I risk if I accept this?

35:26.165 --> 35:28.167
I found it very hard to be fine again

35:28.292 --> 35:29.710
after we split, Conrado.

35:31.796 --> 35:33.131
Now I'm a counselor.

35:34.048 --> 35:34.966
I feel at ease.

35:36.551 --> 35:37.593
I don't want to lose any of that.

35:39.595 --> 35:40.721
And I don't want to lose you.

35:43.057 --> 35:45.143
You are the only reason
I'm willing to risk so much.

35:48.146 --> 35:49.147
Isn't that enough?

36:18.926 --> 36:19.969
It's good to see you, sir.

36:20.136 --> 36:21.345
Did you fulfill my request?

36:21.679 --> 36:22.513
Yes.

36:22.680 --> 36:24.891
It should have arrived
to its destination last night.

36:25.808 --> 36:26.642
Martin.

36:27.852 --> 36:28.811
This is the plan.

36:29.979 --> 36:30.897
I'm getting out of here.

36:31.355 --> 36:32.607
I need your help.

36:32.690 --> 36:35.276
3578, back to your cell. Now!

36:39.322 --> 36:40.823
Leave him. Go away.

36:51.500 --> 36:53.002
I will leave hidden in one
of the food trucks

36:53.085 --> 36:54.545
that come through customs.

36:55.671 --> 36:57.590
We need to reach
the DICE director

36:57.673 --> 36:59.967
to deactivate the security cameras

37:00.051 --> 37:01.177
from the outside.

37:01.761 --> 37:03.179
You only need to contact him.

37:05.223 --> 37:08.559
Valdovinos will take care of
the negotiations.

37:10.561 --> 37:11.646
As for you,

37:13.147 --> 37:14.190
tell us your price

37:14.565 --> 37:15.691
and we'll give you twice as much.

37:16.984 --> 37:18.486
But if you don't want to help,

37:19.487 --> 37:20.738
we'll go after your family

37:22.031 --> 37:23.866
and the pictures won't be as pretty.

37:35.378 --> 37:36.796
Don't make that face, buddy.

37:36.879 --> 37:38.297
He'll help us.

37:38.381 --> 37:39.465
He has no choice.

37:44.720 --> 37:46.055
Where do you want to begin?

38:16.669 --> 38:17.795
You saw him again.

38:20.339 --> 38:21.382
You scared me.

38:23.551 --> 38:24.635
Who did I see again?

38:25.970 --> 38:27.013
Don't deny it.

38:28.597 --> 38:29.640
That boy.

38:30.266 --> 38:32.518
You haven't forgotten about him,
and you saw him today.

38:34.145 --> 38:35.271
I don't know what you're talking about.

38:35.354 --> 38:36.897
Don't deny it. I had you trailed.

38:39.900 --> 38:41.986
You are ruining everything, Conrado.

38:42.403 --> 38:43.321
For both of us.

38:44.488 --> 38:46.532
My godfather does not
forgive treason.

38:54.206 --> 38:55.541
I only saw him a couple times.

38:57.126 --> 38:58.127
I swear.

39:00.755 --> 39:02.173
Please don't tell him.

39:06.469 --> 39:07.762
It was only a hunch.

39:10.848 --> 39:11.807
What?

39:13.017 --> 39:14.310
I did not have you trailed.

39:15.353 --> 39:17.146
I didn't know you saw him again.

39:20.316 --> 39:21.567
But don't worry.

39:21.734 --> 39:22.693
I won't say anything.

39:23.361 --> 39:25.946
I don't care whether
you fuck Lalo or anyone else.

39:26.489 --> 39:28.699
I just wanted to know where I stand.

39:32.620 --> 39:34.163
What do you want for your silence?

39:35.748 --> 39:36.624
Nothing.

39:38.084 --> 39:40.711
All I want is
for this not to affect us.

39:43.047 --> 39:46.342
Are you sure the boy is trustworthy?

39:48.803 --> 39:49.637
Yes.

40:10.282 --> 40:11.409
On your feet.

40:15.496 --> 40:16.455
Warden.

40:16.956 --> 40:18.582
Joaquin Guzman Loera.

40:19.625 --> 40:21.377
From this moment on, there will be a guard

40:21.502 --> 40:22.962
keeping watch over you
every hour of the day.

40:23.504 --> 40:25.464
You won't be allowed to speak
with any other inmate.

40:26.757 --> 40:28.551
You won't be visited by family,

40:28.634 --> 40:30.177
or have any contact with your lawyers.

40:33.013 --> 40:34.974
Tell him whatever
he wants to hear, Martin.

40:36.058 --> 40:37.143
Where do you want to begin?

40:38.144 --> 40:39.979
We'll take care of your family.

40:40.938 --> 40:42.481
We'll take them wherever you tell us to,

40:42.982 --> 40:44.733
and place them under constant guard.

40:45.860 --> 40:46.735
What about him?

40:48.320 --> 40:50.531
Joaquin will be under new rules.

40:50.990 --> 40:52.575
From this moment on, you will be

40:52.658 --> 40:54.326
completely isolated, Guzman.

40:54.702 --> 40:55.953
This violates my rights!

40:56.036 --> 40:57.371
We had a deal, you fucking traitor!

40:57.496 --> 40:58.330
Son of a bitch!

40:58.414 --> 40:59.290
Silence!

41:02.960 --> 41:04.670
Get used to your new company, Guzman.

41:05.004 --> 41:06.088
The guards will be your family

41:06.172 --> 41:07.298
until the gringos take you.

41:12.636 --> 41:13.721
The plan failed.

41:14.138 --> 41:15.264
They isolated him again.

41:15.973 --> 41:17.391
It will be impossible to see him.

41:19.185 --> 41:20.227
What did he say?

41:21.145 --> 41:22.855
I think that this time,

41:22.938 --> 41:24.106
Joaquin is gone forever.

42:12.655 --> 42:14.657
