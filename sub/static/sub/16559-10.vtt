00:02.830 --> 00:03.830
Previously on "How To Get Away
With Murder"...

00:03.830 --> 00:05.080
Here.
A plane ticket home.

00:05.080 --> 00:06.880
Your friends
aren't your family, Micky.

00:06.880 --> 00:08.040
I remember you showing up

00:08.040 --> 00:10.080
messed up
the night of the bonfire.

00:10.080 --> 00:12.500
I wasn't high, Oli.
I was traumatized.

00:12.500 --> 00:13.670
Traumatized from what?

00:13.670 --> 00:15.620
Like you don't
already know.

00:15.620 --> 00:17.210
Hello?
Don't get alarmed, but you need
to come to the police station.

00:17.210 --> 00:18.540
His attorney's calling him
down here right now.

00:18.540 --> 00:20.080
Land him.

00:20.080 --> 00:22.460
We'd like Wes to cooperate
in an ongoing investigation.

00:22.460 --> 00:23.750
A body was found
in the woods.

00:23.750 --> 00:25.880
Rebecca Sutter.
Here it is -- immunity.

00:25.880 --> 00:27.960
Wes,
come to the house right away.

00:28.830 --> 00:29.960
Annalise?

00:31.790 --> 00:33.380
No, no!!

00:33.380 --> 00:34.670
Wipe it clean.

00:34.670 --> 00:36.290
Everything on it.

00:36.290 --> 00:38.460
The official charge --
arson and first-degree murder.

00:38.460 --> 00:39.790
The evidence?

00:39.790 --> 00:40.830
An anonymous source.

00:40.830 --> 00:42.620
Laurel's pregnant.

00:42.620 --> 00:44.620
- Who's dead?
- It's Wes.

00:44.620 --> 00:46.960
He was already dead,
before the fire.

00:46.960 --> 00:49.920

Hey!
Professor Keating.

01:39.080 --> 01:41.380
I, uh --
I got that internship.

01:41.380 --> 01:42.500
What internship?

01:42.500 --> 01:44.210
To work
with undocumented immigrants?

01:44.210 --> 01:45.330
Oh, right.
You got it?

01:45.330 --> 01:46.210
Yeah.

01:46.210 --> 01:47.420

01:58.120 --> 02:00.920

02:04.420 --> 02:07.540

I have a meeting.

Hi.

04:22.710 --> 04:26.210
Everyone's
in the waiting area.

04:26.210 --> 04:27.540
They want to see you,

04:27.540 --> 04:29.880
but the doctors
would only let me in.

04:29.880 --> 04:31.290
I told them
I was your lawyer.

04:37.080 --> 04:38.790
Oh.

04:38.790 --> 04:41.420
Wes died
before the fire.

04:43.080 --> 04:44.920
The M.E. told me.

04:44.920 --> 04:48.920
Did you see anything
before the explosion?

04:50.040 --> 04:51.380
Mm.

04:51.380 --> 04:52.710
I know you're in pain,

04:52.710 --> 04:54.330
but the detectives
will be here soon.

04:57.580 --> 04:58.920
Good.

04:58.920 --> 05:01.040
I want to tell them
who did it.

05:04.120 --> 05:05.040
Frank.

05:05.040 --> 05:07.170
No.

05:07.170 --> 05:10.830
Where is he, then?

05:10.830 --> 05:13.210
I want to ask him
to his face.

05:13.210 --> 05:16.670
You know he would never
hurt any of us.

05:16.670 --> 05:19.420
Of course he would.

05:22.080 --> 05:24.500
Leave.

05:24.500 --> 05:29.080
If you tell the police,
it will hurt all of us.

05:33.170 --> 05:36.250
Leave,
or I'll tell them everything.

05:47.330 --> 05:50.080
How is she?

05:50.080 --> 05:51.920
Okay.

05:51.920 --> 05:54.000
Can we see her?

05:54.000 --> 05:55.540
The doctor said
she's too weak.

05:55.540 --> 05:57.040
Does she remember
anything?

05:57.040 --> 05:58.790
No.
She's in shock.

05:58.790 --> 06:00.330
I'll call Meggy,
see if she can get us in.

06:00.330 --> 06:01.710
Don't.

06:01.710 --> 06:02.670
She needs to be with people
right now.

06:02.670 --> 06:03.710
She needs sleep.

06:03.710 --> 06:05.210
Or you just don't want us
to see her.

06:07.290 --> 06:09.710
You're scared that we
might find out what
actually happened.

06:09.710 --> 06:10.620
No one knows
what happened.

06:10.620 --> 06:12.000
The police
seem pretty confident

06:12.000 --> 06:13.000
that this was Annalise.

06:13.000 --> 06:15.000
Someone's framing her.

06:15.000 --> 06:18.380
And this is not the place
to talk about it.

06:18.380 --> 06:20.790
Go home.
Take care of each other.

06:20.790 --> 06:22.500
I will call you
once I know anything.

06:26.080 --> 06:27.250
Where are you going?

06:27.250 --> 06:29.170
To see Annalise.

06:29.170 --> 06:32.500
Just...tell her
I'm sorry.

06:39.710 --> 06:40.710
Are you okay?

06:40.710 --> 06:42.500
No.

06:42.500 --> 06:43.750
You should come back
with us.

06:43.750 --> 06:44.830
I think
I'm just gonna go home.

06:44.830 --> 06:46.960
Ol, it's not healthy
to be alone right now.

06:46.960 --> 06:50.880
No, I -- Actually, I
think that's exactly
what I need, so...

06:50.880 --> 06:54.330
Laurel thinks it was you.

06:54.330 --> 06:56.080
And what do you think?

06:56.080 --> 06:57.710
Just answer me.

06:57.710 --> 06:59.620
You think I'd do this
to Annalise?

06:59.620 --> 07:00.790
After everything?

07:00.790 --> 07:02.750
I don't know what to think
anymore.

07:07.250 --> 07:10.170
We know who did this.

07:10.170 --> 07:12.750
It's the Mahoneys.

07:12.750 --> 07:16.170
They must have found out
Wes is Wallace's son,

07:16.170 --> 07:18.080
that you knew him.

07:18.080 --> 07:19.670
They have money to make
whatever they need happen.

07:22.120 --> 07:24.920
Annalise?

07:24.920 --> 07:26.000
Doesn't matter
who did it.

07:28.420 --> 07:29.620
Only person locked up
is me.

07:31.250 --> 07:34.960
Your bail hearing
is tomorrow at 2:00.

07:34.960 --> 07:36.710
I called Helen Hughes.
She wants the case.

07:37.790 --> 07:39.750
Eve would be
a conflict of interest.

07:39.750 --> 07:41.580
Everyone's
a conflict of interest.

07:45.830 --> 07:47.210
You have to do this.

07:48.170 --> 07:49.460
No.

07:51.460 --> 07:52.460
I will find someone
you trust.

07:52.460 --> 07:54.500
Bonnie.
You need the best.

07:54.500 --> 07:56.830
We're under attack here.

07:59.670 --> 08:02.000
It has to be you.

08:09.750 --> 08:12.120
Are you sure?

08:12.120 --> 08:13.170
I showed you.

08:13.170 --> 08:14.790
No, I know,
but what if it ripped

08:14.790 --> 08:16.170
when you were
taking it off?

08:16.170 --> 08:17.460
Yeah.

08:17.460 --> 08:19.420
"Yeah" as in
"That's what happened"?

08:19.420 --> 08:20.960
I don't know.

08:23.960 --> 08:25.250
Come here.

08:31.460 --> 08:34.210
I hate my genes.

08:34.210 --> 08:36.880
I was on the pill
when I was 17,

08:36.880 --> 08:39.170
but I turned
into my mother --

08:39.170 --> 08:43.330
anxious, depressed.

08:47.000 --> 08:48.540
I'm fine.

08:48.540 --> 08:50.290
I just had my period,
so...

08:50.290 --> 08:53.380
Yeah,
I'm just being paranoid.

08:53.380 --> 08:56.500
I'm sorry.

08:56.500 --> 08:58.330
It's not your fault.

08:58.330 --> 08:59.540
It is.

08:59.540 --> 09:01.670
No, it's the condom
manufacturer's fault.

09:01.670 --> 09:04.000
Yeah,
but if I wasn't so big,

09:04.000 --> 09:05.170
it never would've broke.

09:11.210 --> 09:13.330
Come on.
That was funny.

09:13.330 --> 09:15.080
It wasn't.

09:15.080 --> 09:16.330
I thought it was.

09:16.330 --> 09:17.330
It wasn't.

09:29.500 --> 09:31.830
Hey.

09:31.830 --> 09:34.960
Those detectives
are here.

09:37.750 --> 09:40.880
Could these drugs
hurt the baby?

09:40.880 --> 09:42.920
No.

09:42.920 --> 09:45.290
They have you on Dilaudid
because it's safe for pregnancy.

09:48.670 --> 09:49.460
Send them in.

09:51.790 --> 09:54.920
I walked in,
I didn't see anyone,

09:54.920 --> 09:58.460
so I looked
in the kitchen.

09:58.460 --> 10:01.250
That's when I saw that
the basement door was open,

10:01.250 --> 10:04.540
so I went down there.

10:04.540 --> 10:06.330
What did you see?

10:06.330 --> 10:08.170
Um...

10:08.170 --> 10:10.710
I just heard a -- mm --

10:10.710 --> 10:14.000
a noise
coming from upstairs,

10:14.000 --> 10:16.580
and then I woke up here.

10:16.580 --> 10:19.210
When Professor Keating
called you,

10:19.210 --> 10:21.380
did she say why
she wanted you at the house?

10:21.380 --> 10:24.960
You're trying
to charge her

10:24.960 --> 10:27.290
with my attempted murder,
right?

10:31.880 --> 10:33.460
Annalise didn't do this.

10:33.460 --> 10:35.420
Because you know who did?

10:37.830 --> 10:41.620
Well, that's your job
to figure out.

10:41.620 --> 10:43.500
It's got to be Frank's,
right?

10:43.500 --> 10:45.120
He's only been back
a week.

10:45.120 --> 10:48.380
Yeah, well, it only takes
one orgasm to make a baby.

10:48.380 --> 10:50.880
Can we please stop
talking about this,

10:50.880 --> 10:52.620
especially
in front of my mom?

10:52.620 --> 10:54.420
Why? You afraid she's gonna want
to adopt it?

11:00.620 --> 11:02.710
Mom?

11:04.540 --> 11:06.040
Mom?

11:06.040 --> 11:07.420
Michaela.

11:09.330 --> 11:10.750
What does it say?

11:18.750 --> 11:19.880
I'm sorry.

11:21.120 --> 11:22.920
I told her to go.

11:22.920 --> 11:24.920
Yeah, but that was before
she knew anyone was dead.

11:24.920 --> 11:26.120
She knew.

11:26.120 --> 11:27.830
She's probably at the airport.
I-I can go grab her.

11:27.830 --> 11:28.790
I don't...

11:28.790 --> 11:31.710
I don't care.

11:31.710 --> 11:33.330
Look, anyone
would be upset by this.

11:33.330 --> 11:35.830
I'm upset because
our friend is dead,

11:35.830 --> 11:37.920
not because
of that terrible woman.

11:37.920 --> 11:39.960
Did you really just call
Waitlist your friend?

11:39.960 --> 11:42.880
'Cause I kind of
recall you hating him

11:42.880 --> 11:44.920
before he became
barbecue.

11:46.920 --> 11:49.080
I'm gonna take a shower.

11:49.080 --> 11:51.080
Dibs on the second shower.

12:05.290 --> 12:08.170
You not eating?

12:08.170 --> 12:09.920
What, you trying to keep it
tight for a conjugal,

12:09.920 --> 12:13.920
or you just afraid of needing to
drop the kids off at the pool?

12:13.920 --> 12:18.210
Look, you gonna pee,
drop a deuce,

12:18.210 --> 12:20.960
get your period,
have sex in front of us.

12:20.960 --> 12:23.540
Sooner you get over it
the better.

12:23.540 --> 12:26.210
Mm!

12:26.210 --> 12:28.620
Ahh.

12:28.620 --> 12:30.250
See, it's easy.

12:30.250 --> 12:32.330
It's no different
than you alone

12:32.330 --> 12:34.290
in what I'm guessing
is some big ol', fancy crib --

12:34.290 --> 12:39.580
Bitch, will you just
leave her be?

12:39.580 --> 12:42.250
Or do I need to drown you
in your own piss?

12:43.710 --> 12:46.420
So, you admit

12:46.420 --> 12:48.210
going to talk to Ms. Keating
in her holding cell,

12:48.210 --> 12:50.170
and this is just an hour

12:50.170 --> 12:51.830
after you talked
to the Medical Examiner?

12:51.830 --> 12:53.460
Due to
our prior relationship,

12:53.460 --> 12:55.330
I felt she might disclose
key evidence for us.

12:55.330 --> 12:57.710
To be clear,
you did this on your own.

12:57.710 --> 13:00.080
No one in this office
cleared you to do that?

13:01.670 --> 13:02.960
No.

13:02.960 --> 13:05.790
Well, Nate, I'm sorry,

13:05.790 --> 13:07.290
but we're gonna need
to reassess your position here.

13:08.670 --> 13:10.620
You tell him about us?

13:10.620 --> 13:11.620
Nate.

13:11.620 --> 13:12.880
That's a no.

13:12.880 --> 13:13.750
We've been
sleeping together.

13:15.040 --> 13:18.880
I imagine any demotion

13:18.880 --> 13:20.920
might be construed
as sexual harassment.

13:33.750 --> 13:34.750
Grabbing a woman's ass
is never okay.

13:34.750 --> 13:35.580
I thought you were
my girlfriend.

13:35.580 --> 13:36.670
That's the best excuse

13:36.670 --> 13:38.120
you could come up with,
Baby Trump?

13:38.120 --> 13:39.620
Mm, it's not an excuse.

13:39.620 --> 13:41.000
You look just like her.

13:41.000 --> 13:42.500
You might know her --
Michaela Pratt?

13:42.500 --> 13:44.750
I might know her
'cause she's black?

13:44.750 --> 13:45.750
We all look alike?

13:45.750 --> 13:47.580
No. No, no.
That's not what I meant.

13:47.580 --> 13:49.380
So you're a racist
and a pervert.

13:49.380 --> 13:50.620
H-How does that
make me a racist?

13:50.620 --> 13:52.580
I-I can understand a pervert,
sure, but --

13:52.580 --> 13:53.920
Wes.
Wes!

13:53.920 --> 13:54.830
This is my friend Wes.

13:54.830 --> 13:56.120
He'll tell you.

13:56.120 --> 13:57.330
Doesn't she look
exactly like Michaela?

13:57.330 --> 13:59.540
Oh, my God.
You're just making this worse!

14:01.920 --> 14:04.380
You do kind of
look like her.

14:04.380 --> 14:06.120
See?
Not a racist.

14:06.120 --> 14:07.500
Come anywhere near me
again,

14:07.500 --> 14:10.080
and I report you
to the police.

14:12.250 --> 14:13.920
You think that was racist,
don't you?

14:13.920 --> 14:15.330
I just think
you're white.

14:15.330 --> 14:18.120
Please don't tell Michaela.

14:39.580 --> 14:41.120
Stop it.

14:41.120 --> 14:44.080
Sorry.

14:44.080 --> 14:45.670
How you doing?

14:45.670 --> 14:49.580
I just need sleep.

14:52.330 --> 14:54.170
I told you
I want to be alone.

14:54.170 --> 14:55.420
I know.

14:55.420 --> 14:59.540
I just didn't know
if you really meant that.

15:01.920 --> 15:04.330
What's going on, Oli?

15:04.330 --> 15:05.500
Annalise asked me

15:05.500 --> 15:07.670
to delete everything
on her phone last night...

15:07.670 --> 15:10.670
before I knew
Wes was dead.

15:10.670 --> 15:12.580
That means
she did this, right?

15:12.580 --> 15:13.670
No.

15:13.670 --> 15:15.460
You told Bonnie
you thought she did it.

15:15.460 --> 15:17.790
Yeah, I was wrong.
She's being framed.

15:17.790 --> 15:19.080
Or maybe
you're lying to me

15:19.080 --> 15:20.420
the same way you lied about
the night of the bonfire.

15:23.420 --> 15:25.920
Sam Keating went missing
that night.

15:28.540 --> 15:30.710
His remains were found
a few weeks later.

15:30.710 --> 15:31.960
Did you all do that?

15:35.380 --> 15:36.960
Do you really
want to know?

15:40.460 --> 15:44.250
No, because
the minute you tell me...

15:44.250 --> 15:46.460
I'm guilty, too, right?

15:46.460 --> 15:50.170
Of conspiracy
to commit murder,

15:50.170 --> 15:51.830
obstruction of justice?

15:51.830 --> 15:54.040
You could go to the police
right now.

15:54.040 --> 15:58.120
Nobody would blame you.

15:58.120 --> 16:00.460
I just want to be by myself
right now.
Oli, look, I'll stay.

16:00.460 --> 16:02.710
We don't even
need to talk.
Connor, please.

16:10.580 --> 16:11.920
Okay.

16:11.920 --> 16:13.540
Um...

16:13.540 --> 16:15.920

heard something --

I haven't.

17:03.750 --> 17:05.210
I can't be telling you
when I do.

17:07.830 --> 17:12.120
Why'd you go to her last night
if you don't want to help?

17:12.120 --> 17:15.620
So I could look her in the eye
and see if she did this.

17:15.620 --> 17:17.330
She didn't.

17:17.330 --> 17:20.960
You know that
for a fact?

the bail hearing a day.

19:35.170 --> 19:36.920
Why?

19:36.920 --> 19:39.210
They still haven't released
the autopsy reports,

19:39.210 --> 19:41.290
which we need if we want
to challenge a bail denial.

19:41.290 --> 19:42.790
Did you go to Nate?

19:48.540 --> 19:51.330
We don't need Nate.

19:51.330 --> 19:54.330
The M.E. will release
the cause of death soon,

every call
made or received.

20:46.040 --> 20:47.250
Best I could do.

20:52.330 --> 20:55.080
What's wrong?

20:57.960 --> 20:59.960
She needs
a real lawyer.

21:03.080 --> 21:05.250
What would Sam say
right now?

21:07.670 --> 21:09.620
You're as good
as Annalise.

21:11.790 --> 21:13.580
Let's go.

21:15.790 --> 21:17.210
Did you call your parents?

21:19.750 --> 21:21.540
Do you want me
to call them?

21:21.540 --> 21:23.210
Mm, they'll just
make it worse.

21:23.210 --> 21:26.880
BonBon said the police
will be stopping by.

21:26.880 --> 21:28.000
Yeah, they were here.

21:29.500 --> 21:32.080
They wanted me to tell them
it was Annalise.

21:32.080 --> 21:33.920
Did you?

21:33.920 --> 21:35.080
No.

21:35.080 --> 21:37.540
Why not?

21:41.830 --> 21:44.040
Annalise wouldn't hurt Wes.

21:44.040 --> 21:48.210
She would
if he was gonna turn her in.

21:48.210 --> 21:50.620
She probably
had Frank do it.
Connor.

21:50.620 --> 21:52.540
And you're just protecting Frank
'cause the baby's his, right?

21:52.540 --> 21:53.790
Shut your mouth
right now.

21:53.790 --> 21:54.960
Annalise wouldn't
do this.

21:54.960 --> 21:56.000
Then why
did she have Oliver

21:56.000 --> 21:57.170
delete everything
from her phone?

21:57.170 --> 21:58.080
What are you
talking about?

21:58.080 --> 22:00.380
She told him
to clear her phone

22:00.380 --> 22:02.920
before he knew
that Wes was dead.

22:02.920 --> 22:04.330
And now he might go
to the police.

22:04.330 --> 22:05.670
You have to stop him.

22:07.120 --> 22:08.750
No.

22:08.750 --> 22:10.120
Have you lost your mind?
We'll all go to jail!

22:10.120 --> 22:11.960
How do you know
that she didn't do this

22:11.960 --> 22:13.880
or that she's coming
for one of us next?

22:13.880 --> 22:15.750
It was the Mahoneys.
Wes testified against them.

22:15.750 --> 22:17.000
How do we know
this wasn't you?

22:17.000 --> 22:18.460
What?

22:18.460 --> 22:20.330
Where were you
last night?

22:20.330 --> 22:24.250
I was with Thomas.
I told you.

22:24.250 --> 22:25.460
And he'll verify that?

22:25.460 --> 22:27.380
Because you haven't seemed
that upset by this.

22:27.380 --> 22:28.540
Do you seriously think
I did this?

22:28.540 --> 22:30.080
Wes is dead,
and you're not upset at all!

22:30.080 --> 22:31.460
Who's the person
who started all this?

22:31.460 --> 22:32.960
It's always been him.

22:32.960 --> 22:34.290
Stop talking.
So, yeah.

22:34.290 --> 22:36.170
Maybe part of me
is relieved that he's gone.

22:36.170 --> 22:37.670
Connor!
He did kill someone,
after all,

22:37.670 --> 22:38.790
so maybe
this is just karma.

22:38.790 --> 22:40.920
The baby is Wes'.

22:48.500 --> 22:50.830
Well, you should
just get an abortion now,

22:50.830 --> 22:53.540
'cause Waitlist isn't
the type of father you
want for your child.

22:54.500 --> 22:56.790
Asher!

22:56.790 --> 22:58.040
Hit me!
Stop!

22:58.040 --> 22:59.710
Do it! Hit me!
Asher!

22:59.710 --> 23:01.750
Get off!
Get off of him!

23:01.750 --> 23:02.790
Asher,
what is wrong with you?!

23:12.830 --> 23:13.580
Waitlist!

23:15.880 --> 23:17.750
Aww.

23:17.750 --> 23:18.830
You look like a picture

23:18.830 --> 23:20.790
straight out
of a Middleton brochure.

23:20.790 --> 23:24.620
You know, if they allowed
killers in there.

23:25.620 --> 23:27.750
What do you want?

23:27.750 --> 23:31.080
I just like
looking at you.

23:32.460 --> 23:34.120
I have to study,
Connor.

23:34.120 --> 23:38.500
I just got out of therapy.

23:38.500 --> 23:40.750
It's the first time
I've been back since I was 17

23:40.750 --> 23:43.710
and needed to talk through
all my gay stuff.

23:43.710 --> 23:45.460
Now I just need
to talk through

23:45.460 --> 23:47.420
all my murder stuff.

23:49.290 --> 23:50.920
I'm kidding.

23:52.380 --> 23:53.920
I talked about Oliver
the whole time.

23:53.920 --> 23:57.290
It's lame, I know.

24:00.710 --> 24:02.080
He just needs space.

24:03.750 --> 24:05.790
How do you know?

24:05.790 --> 24:08.120
He got really drunk at my
birthday party the other night

24:08.120 --> 24:10.000
and told Meggy.

24:13.920 --> 24:17.080
We should let them go,
right?

24:17.080 --> 24:20.420
Like, if we were
at all good people,

24:20.420 --> 24:21.580
we'd want them
to be free of us.

24:27.330 --> 24:28.500
Maybe.

24:36.080 --> 24:39.040
What did you do to him?

24:41.750 --> 24:43.710
I-I assume
there's a reason

24:43.710 --> 24:44.960
that he went all frat boy
on you.

24:49.170 --> 24:50.620
I said something stupid.

24:54.460 --> 24:56.540
Grief makes people
do stupid things.

25:00.000 --> 25:01.420
How are you?

25:05.460 --> 25:06.380
I don't know.

25:11.670 --> 25:13.460
I can't even
look at you right now.

25:13.460 --> 25:15.120
Is that what you were like
when you ran over Sinclair?

25:15.120 --> 25:16.750
You've got some crazy
rage problems or something?

25:16.750 --> 25:18.380
I'm just upset.
We're all upset!

25:18.380 --> 25:20.290
You don't seem
that sad.

25:20.290 --> 25:22.210
I'm sad.

25:22.210 --> 25:24.500
I'm just not crying about it
every second like you.

25:24.500 --> 25:25.500
Okay, but what about
when your mom left?

25:25.500 --> 25:26.830
That clearly
hurt you --

25:26.830 --> 25:28.420
We're dealing with your mess
right now, not mine.

25:28.420 --> 25:30.290
We're all a mess
right now!

25:30.290 --> 25:31.670
That's
the point!

25:31.670 --> 25:32.920
And maybe
I'm supposed to hide that

25:32.920 --> 25:34.670
or pretend
that I'm some unfeeling jerk,

25:34.670 --> 25:38.540
but...Wes is dead.

25:38.540 --> 25:43.000
That doesn't mean you get
to act like an animal.

25:43.000 --> 25:43.960
Go home.

25:43.960 --> 25:46.750
What?

25:46.750 --> 25:48.170
I'm staying here
with Laurel

25:48.170 --> 25:50.500
to make sure you didn't
put her on suicide watch.

26:04.170 --> 26:05.960
What?

26:05.960 --> 26:09.250
Look at this number --
where it came from.

26:09.250 --> 26:11.540
Brookline, Mass.

26:11.540 --> 26:14.250
Hannah Keating called the police
at 10:30 that night.

26:14.250 --> 26:17.750
It was after
the fire started.

26:17.750 --> 26:19.750
I don't know how she could have
found out about it so soon

26:19.750 --> 26:22.170
unless she knew
it was going to happen.

26:22.170 --> 26:23.920
Or she was working
with the Mahoneys.

26:23.920 --> 26:26.880
It seems insane,
I know,

26:26.880 --> 26:29.210
but she's always wanted
the house,

26:29.210 --> 26:31.830
and she'd know that hurting Wes
would hurt you.

26:31.830 --> 26:33.290
I called her.

26:40.000 --> 26:42.330
Automated voicemail box for...

26:42.330 --> 26:43.790
Hannah Keating.

26:43.790 --> 26:45.620
You always hated
my black ass

26:45.620 --> 26:47.290
living in your mommy
and daddy's house.

26:47.290 --> 26:50.790
So take it, Hannah.

26:50.790 --> 26:52.710
I'm done with it.

26:54.920 --> 26:57.920
Not like anything good
happened to me

26:57.920 --> 27:00.170
since the minute
I moved in here.

27:02.880 --> 27:05.170
That's not enough
to incriminate you.

27:05.170 --> 27:06.500
She thinks I killed Sam,

27:06.500 --> 27:09.330
so she'll say
whatever it takes to ruin me.

27:09.330 --> 27:12.880
She finally won.

27:12.880 --> 27:15.960
It just took me
helping her.

27:34.460 --> 27:36.120
Shopping for Meggy?

27:36.120 --> 27:37.710
You feel bad
you dumped her

27:37.710 --> 27:39.790
and think tacky jewelry
will win her back?

27:39.790 --> 27:41.920
No.

27:41.920 --> 27:44.620
Then who's it for?

27:44.620 --> 27:46.620
Do not say Annalise.

27:46.620 --> 27:48.080
No. God.

27:51.830 --> 27:53.540
Laurel.

27:55.210 --> 27:56.620
Don't tell anyone.

27:56.620 --> 27:57.960
Why not?

27:57.960 --> 28:00.250
The same reason you didn't want
to tell us about Asher.

28:00.250 --> 28:02.080
Because I was
embarrassed of him.

28:02.080 --> 28:03.710
Which makes sense

28:03.710 --> 28:05.330
if you're Laurel
in this situation,

28:05.330 --> 28:06.920
but  you...

28:09.380 --> 28:11.880
Mm.

28:11.880 --> 28:14.000
You're worried
Frank's gonna find out.

28:14.000 --> 28:14.960
He'll kill you.
You know that?

28:14.960 --> 28:16.830
We're happy.

28:16.830 --> 28:20.290
I just...don't want
to ruin that.

28:22.120 --> 28:23.830
I won't tell anyone.

28:23.830 --> 28:26.290
Thanks.

28:26.290 --> 28:27.830
But I do not approve.

28:27.830 --> 28:30.790
You broke up with Meggy
like five minutes ago,

28:30.790 --> 28:32.620
and now you're already buying
jewelry for some other girl?

28:32.620 --> 28:33.880
It's not just
some other girl.

28:33.880 --> 28:35.580
I'm just saying,

28:35.580 --> 28:38.040
maybe you need to be alone
for a second.

28:38.040 --> 28:39.620
How would you know
what I need?

28:39.620 --> 28:41.790
This is the most
we've ever talked.

28:41.790 --> 28:43.920
Well...

28:43.920 --> 28:46.540
it's not like you come
talk to me, either.

28:49.080 --> 28:52.000
How much can you spend?

28:52.000 --> 28:54.080
'Cause our girl's rich, and
she'll know if you cheap out.

29:02.790 --> 29:04.790
Your nurses are no joke.

29:04.790 --> 29:06.290
They won't give up
the pain meds.

29:09.830 --> 29:10.920
Should I get ice chips?

29:13.120 --> 29:14.620
I could read you
a ConLaw brief.

29:14.620 --> 29:15.830
That should put you
right to sleep.

29:18.210 --> 29:19.830
How's your mom?

29:19.830 --> 29:20.880
Uh, she left.

29:20.880 --> 29:22.420
Why?

29:22.420 --> 29:24.000
It doesn't matter.

29:24.000 --> 29:25.750
Please.
I need to be distracted.

29:25.750 --> 29:28.500
Um...

29:31.250 --> 29:33.170
I kicked her out.

29:33.170 --> 29:36.420
It was before
I knew what happened.

29:36.420 --> 29:39.040
Or I'm just
a horrible person.

29:39.040 --> 29:41.670
You're not.

29:43.790 --> 29:46.080
I am.

29:48.750 --> 29:54.210
Whatever
you need or decide,

29:54.210 --> 29:56.330
I'm here for you,
okay?

30:02.790 --> 30:04.880
Oh, press it.

30:04.880 --> 30:06.540
It's green.

30:14.580 --> 30:17.500
Automated voicemail box for...

30:17.500 --> 30:18.500
Hannah Keating.

30:18.500 --> 30:20.710
So, take it, Hannah.

30:20.710 --> 30:22.420
I'm done with it.

30:24.500 --> 30:25.830
No, no!!

30:29.580 --> 30:32.420
You burned a boy
in your house.

30:32.420 --> 30:36.500
Or that's...what
I heard the guards say.

30:38.920 --> 30:41.750
Good thing
you a lawyer.

30:44.250 --> 30:47.790
I knew I'd seen
your face before --

30:47.790 --> 30:52.620
In court once,
waiting on one of my cases.

30:52.620 --> 30:59.460
You was wearing this badass
red-leather jacket --

30:59.460 --> 31:03.170
had them Malaysian tracks
flowing,

31:03.170 --> 31:07.880
guns out, screaming
at that old-white-man D.A.

31:10.580 --> 31:13.080
And I'm thinking,

31:13.080 --> 31:17.080
"Why can't this queen
defend me?"

31:20.790 --> 31:23.000
Jacked up, ain't it?

31:25.210 --> 31:33.250
No matter how high
or how far we climb,

31:33.250 --> 31:39.830
they gonna find a way
to pull us back down.

31:45.920 --> 31:47.460
I have a plan.

31:47.460 --> 31:49.750
If I compel them to disclose
Hannah as their source,

31:49.750 --> 31:52.500
I can undermine her testimony
completely.

31:52.500 --> 31:54.710
She accused you
of killing Sam.

31:54.710 --> 31:57.000
It all speaks
to her bias against you.

31:59.790 --> 32:02.290
Tell me you think
it's a good idea.

32:04.920 --> 32:07.380
Whatever you think.

32:09.420 --> 32:12.080
Due to the heinous
nature of this crime,

32:12.080 --> 32:14.500
specifically
the murder of Wesley Gibbins,

32:14.500 --> 32:15.960
we believe
Ms. Keating's release

32:15.960 --> 32:18.290
would pose a threat
to the citizens of Philadelphia.

32:19.830 --> 32:21.330
And with
her financial resources...

32:21.330 --> 32:25.290
...we see little
impeding her flight.

32:25.290 --> 32:26.580
Therefore,
the State strongly recommends

32:26.580 --> 32:27.960
Your Honor deny her bail.

32:27.960 --> 32:28.960
Ms. Winterbottom?

32:33.580 --> 32:35.250
Your Honor,
the State's evidence

32:35.250 --> 32:37.040
to support their allegations
against my client

32:37.040 --> 32:39.120
is lacking,
if not non-existent.

32:39.120 --> 32:41.170
We aren't arguing the facts
of this case today, Your Honor.

32:41.170 --> 32:43.380
Any effort
to deny my client bail

32:43.380 --> 32:45.250
must be based
on credible evidence...

32:45.250 --> 32:47.960
...but the State's case
is based on an anonymous source.

32:47.960 --> 32:49.330
Objection.
Speculative.

32:49.330 --> 32:50.750
My client was arrested

32:50.750 --> 32:52.960
before an autopsy of the victim
could be conducted.

32:52.960 --> 32:54.750
There's an independent basis
for probable cause.

32:54.750 --> 32:57.000
It's our right to ask
that the source be identified

32:57.000 --> 32:59.120
to know whether there's
any warrant to this case.

32:59.120 --> 33:01.250
Mr. Denver,
may I ask why

33:01.250 --> 33:03.420
you don't want
to reveal this source?

33:03.420 --> 33:05.330
We are protecting their safety,
Your Honor.

33:05.330 --> 33:06.880
Well, certainly
there's additional evidence

33:06.880 --> 33:09.040
you could offer the court
to prove that the defendant

33:09.040 --> 33:11.830
should remain in custody
until the trial,

33:11.830 --> 33:14.500
otherwise I'm inclined
to set bail.

33:18.960 --> 33:21.290
Your Honor, we would ask
for a short recess

33:21.290 --> 33:22.460
so that we may discuss
the matter internally?

33:22.460 --> 33:24.210
15 minutes.

33:30.120 --> 33:31.620
Oh, my God.
What happened?

33:31.620 --> 33:34.880
I said some stuff
I shouldn't have.

33:38.750 --> 33:40.580
Well,
where is everyone?

33:40.580 --> 33:42.790
Michaela's
at the hospital.

33:42.790 --> 33:46.040
Asher's at
Annalise's bail hearing.

33:46.040 --> 33:49.210
And you didn't want
to go?

33:49.210 --> 33:52.670
I don't know what I want
to happen to Annalise right now.

33:52.670 --> 33:55.330
Because you think
she did it?

33:55.330 --> 33:58.040
I don't know.

33:58.040 --> 34:00.290
Oli, you got to go
to the police.

34:00.290 --> 34:01.420
No.

34:01.420 --> 34:02.830
You can tell them

34:02.830 --> 34:04.250
that you cleared her phone
because she threatened you.

34:04.250 --> 34:05.750
She didn't.
You can get immunity.

34:05.750 --> 34:07.120
And what about you?
It doesn't matter.

34:07.120 --> 34:08.210
I-I'm not just gonna
go turn you in.

34:08.210 --> 34:09.330
I'm gonna be fine,
okay?

34:09.330 --> 34:10.380
You're my life, Connor.

34:10.380 --> 34:11.290
Well, you can find
someone better!

34:11.290 --> 34:12.210
Don't say that.

34:13.920 --> 34:16.040
I slept with Thomas.

34:19.080 --> 34:21.040
That's what I was doing
last night.

34:21.040 --> 34:22.040
I was -- I was
sleeping with him.

34:22.040 --> 34:24.580
I -- I wasn't at Asher's.

34:28.210 --> 34:29.210
You still want
to protect me?

34:34.210 --> 34:36.000
Of course.
Oli.

34:36.000 --> 34:39.170
You just slept with him
to hurt me.

34:39.170 --> 34:41.710
Yeah, and I'm gonna
continue to hurt you.

34:41.710 --> 34:43.460
It's -- It's what I do.

34:43.460 --> 34:44.790
It's who --
It's who I am.

34:44.790 --> 34:46.920
It's who we all are.
We are bad people.

34:46.920 --> 34:48.040
No.
No, you're not.

34:48.040 --> 34:49.790
Look, I don't even care
that Wes is dead.

34:49.790 --> 34:52.620
I don't.
Honestly, I do--

34:52.620 --> 34:55.790
I feel nothing.

34:55.790 --> 34:59.330
I'm just broken and sick,

34:59.330 --> 35:01.500
and I need
all of this to stop.

35:01.500 --> 35:04.460
So, please...

35:04.460 --> 35:06.920
please, just do
what I never could.

35:06.920 --> 35:08.960
You're bleeding.

35:15.250 --> 35:16.580
I --

35:16.580 --> 35:20.420
You can end all this.

35:20.420 --> 35:22.750
Just be quiet.

35:22.750 --> 35:24.920
This is a question
of safety, Your Honor,

35:24.920 --> 35:27.620
which is why we cannot reveal
the identity of our source.

35:27.620 --> 35:30.080
However,
we are prepared to disclose

35:30.080 --> 35:32.120
an additional piece of evidence
at this time.

35:32.120 --> 35:34.250
Ms. Atwood.

35:34.250 --> 35:37.580
Your Honor,
I've been running point

35:37.580 --> 35:39.790
on an investigation

35:39.790 --> 35:42.580
into Annalise Keating's
potential involvement

35:42.580 --> 35:45.830
in a number
of unsolved crimes.

35:45.830 --> 35:48.960
We approached Wesley Gibbins
with an immunity deal

35:48.960 --> 35:51.000
in exchange
for his cooperation

35:51.000 --> 35:52.670
in building the case
against her.

35:52.670 --> 35:54.540
Mr. Gibbins did not
sign the immunity deal,

35:54.540 --> 35:56.080
but you can see
he made notations

35:56.080 --> 35:58.750
which prove he was about
to accept the terms.

35:58.750 --> 36:01.120
Unfortunately,
he left the station

36:01.120 --> 36:05.170
and, in just a few hours,
was killed in a fire.

36:05.170 --> 36:08.170
We proffer that Mr. Gibbins
went to Ms. Keating's,

36:08.170 --> 36:09.710
told her about
the investigation,

36:09.710 --> 36:11.170
which is why
she killed him.

36:11.170 --> 36:12.750
Your Honor,
there are other suspects

36:12.750 --> 36:14.170
the D.A.'s Office
is refusing to look into.

36:14.170 --> 36:15.250
Furthermore,
our investigation --

36:15.250 --> 36:16.250
The victim
was an eyewitness

36:16.250 --> 36:17.790
in the Charles Mahoney
murder trial.

36:17.790 --> 36:19.080
All the evidence
points to Ms. Keating.

36:19.080 --> 36:20.460
Clearly,
the Mahoney family had motive

36:20.460 --> 36:21.920
to kill Mr. Gibbins.

36:21.920 --> 36:23.460
Ms. Winterbottom,
you asked for more evidence.

36:23.460 --> 36:25.750
This is it.
But, Your Honor --

36:25.750 --> 36:28.210
I'm denying Ms. Keating's
request for bail

36:28.210 --> 36:30.290
and ordering
that she be remanded

36:30.290 --> 36:33.920
to Philadelphia County Prison
to await trial.

36:45.540 --> 36:47.080
Wes didn't sign the deal.

36:47.080 --> 36:48.620
That means we can challenge
the theory of motive.
Bonnie.

36:48.620 --> 36:50.330
If that's all they have,
I'll get it thrown out.
Didn't you hear them?

36:50.330 --> 36:52.120
It's just the beginning.

36:53.500 --> 36:55.710
You did your best.

36:58.460 --> 37:00.420
Good afternoon.

37:00.420 --> 37:02.880
On behalf of
the District Attorney's Office,

37:02.880 --> 37:04.330
we're pleased
with the judge's decision

37:04.330 --> 37:06.000
to keep Annalise Keating
in state custody

37:06.000 --> 37:07.960
for the duration
of her prosecution.

37:07.960 --> 37:09.790
A young man
has been murdered,

37:09.790 --> 37:11.460
and it is
of the upmost importance

37:11.460 --> 37:14.540
to A.D.A. Atwood and myself

37:14.540 --> 37:15.540
that Ms. Keating
be brought to justice

37:15.540 --> 37:17.500
for this heinous crime.

37:17.500 --> 37:18.920
You're right.

37:18.920 --> 37:21.040
I acted
like a Neanderthal,

37:21.040 --> 37:24.620
and...clearly, that's
something I have to work on,

37:24.620 --> 37:27.250
and I will, but...

37:27.250 --> 37:30.290
to have to spend another night
in that dorm, alone --

37:30.290 --> 37:32.290
Promise me I'll never see you
act that way again.

37:32.290 --> 37:33.880
I promise.

37:33.880 --> 37:35.460
I'm serious.

37:35.460 --> 37:36.880
That's not behavior
I can handle.

37:36.880 --> 37:37.790
I know, and I --

37:37.790 --> 37:40.210
Asher...

37:40.210 --> 37:43.290
I'm not the only one
you need to apologize to.

37:43.290 --> 37:45.120
We intend to hold
Ms. Keating accountable

37:45.120 --> 37:48.080
for her violent,
senseless actions.

37:48.080 --> 37:50.880
♪ There's something
on your mind ♪
She took the life
of this bright young man...

37:50.880 --> 37:52.330
Hey.

37:52.330 --> 37:53.540
...one of her own law students

37:53.540 --> 37:55.170
at Middleton University.

37:55.170 --> 37:58.080
He was someone who trusted her,
who worked for her,

37:58.080 --> 38:00.790
and, ultimately,
was murdered by her.

38:00.790 --> 38:03.290
Current charges
against Ms. Keating

38:03.290 --> 38:05.540
are arson
and first-degree murder.

38:05.540 --> 38:07.250
But we have just
scratched the surface

38:07.250 --> 38:08.460
of the evidence
we plan to present.

38:10.830 --> 38:13.500
In the past, Ms. Keating
has been questioned

38:13.500 --> 38:17.080
for crimes close to her
that have gone unsolved --

38:17.080 --> 38:20.710
most notably the murder
of her husband, Sam Keating.

38:20.710 --> 38:24.580
This trial will yield new
information about that murder.

38:28.420 --> 38:31.250
We're also here today
to announce that we've received

38:31.250 --> 38:34.960
the official autopsy report
for Mr. Gibbins.

38:34.960 --> 38:36.250
Dr. Bradfield

38:36.250 --> 38:37.920
of the Philadelphia
Medical Examiner's Office

38:37.920 --> 38:40.960
has confirmed
our initial suspicions

38:40.960 --> 38:43.670
that Mr. Gibbins'
cause of death

38:43.670 --> 38:46.540
is asphyxiation
due to smoke inhalation.

38:46.540 --> 38:48.920
This reaffirms
our belief

38:48.920 --> 38:52.040
that Ms. Keating planned
and executed the fire

38:52.040 --> 38:54.460
in order to kill
Mr. Gibbins.

38:54.460 --> 38:57.250
Mmm!
Smells like fresh fish.

38:57.250 --> 39:01.880
I saw someone there...

39:01.880 --> 39:05.790
in the basement.

39:05.790 --> 39:07.670
They ran out
of the storm door.

39:09.580 --> 39:12.040
Was it you?

39:12.040 --> 39:15.040
No.

39:17.330 --> 39:19.000
It should have been you.

39:23.210 --> 39:24.580
He'd still be alive

39:24.580 --> 39:26.710
if you would have
just stayed away.

39:34.040 --> 39:36.250
But he's dead.

39:36.250 --> 39:38.500
I don't blame Annalise
for that.

39:40.210 --> 39:44.380
I blame you,
'cause it's always you.

39:46.500 --> 39:50.290
I loved him so much more
than I have ever loved you.

39:52.040 --> 39:54.290
It should have been you.

39:58.380 --> 40:00.710
Well, look who's back.

40:10.080 --> 40:11.170
You're not permitted
to be here.

40:11.170 --> 40:13.330
You said he died
before the fire.

40:13.330 --> 40:16.040
Before I did
the official autopsy.

40:16.040 --> 40:17.540
Our initial theories
change all the time.

40:24.540 --> 40:26.500
Here.

40:28.540 --> 40:30.120
I ain't trying
to kill you.

Wes died in the fire,

41:06.420 --> 41:09.710

so...

41:09.710 --> 41:12.830
Just -- I need you.

41:17.790 --> 41:20.710
We were told you wanted
to make a statement?

41:20.710 --> 41:23.040
About the murder
of Wes Gibbins.

41:23.040 --> 41:24.380
What about it?

41:27.790 --> 41:29.460
I did it.

41:47.170 --> 41:48.210
Hey.

41:50.080 --> 41:51.460
Get in.
