-Well, I'm not going to.

It's one thing
to dislike your parents.

It's not like you
have a choice.

29:51.706 --> 29:54.250
when I first met her,
I was just...

29:56.252 --> 29:58.379
immediately in love.

30:00.423 --> 30:02.634
-In love?
-Rue: Yeah.

I don't know.
Maybe that's what
it was, right?

30:26.658 --> 30:28.409
Like...

30:28.493 --> 30:32.247
as soon as I saw her,
I was just immediately
afraid to lose her.

30:33.248 --> 30:34.624
Who have you lost?

30:35.667 --> 30:37.752
Uh, my dad.

30:37.835 --> 30:40.296
-Meaning?
-Meaning he's dead.

30:42.048 --> 30:44.467
Shit, I'm sorry.

30:44.551 --> 30:46.719
It's fine.
You didn't, like, kill him.

with hating yourself is you

33:26.504 --> 33:28.172
