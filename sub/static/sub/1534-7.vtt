All right, Queenie, time to talk.

12:23.851 --> 12:26.119
Ooh. You should get that looked at, Emma.

12:26.153 --> 12:27.888
Oh, now you want to play nice?

12:27.922 --> 12:29.189
With you two?

12:29.223 --> 12:31.657
Don't you understand,
that's all I've ever wanted.

12:31.692 --> 12:34.059
We don't care what you want. Where is Anna?

12:34.094 --> 12:35.895
She's alive. We know it.
We heard her heartbeat.

12:35.929 --> 12:37.697
You heard her heartbeat?

12:37.731 --> 12:39.632
From Bo Peep's Crook.

12:39.666 --> 12:41.434
Sounds like someone's grasping at straws

12:41.468 --> 12:42.802
about their long-lost sister.

12:42.836 --> 12:43.903
What happened to her?

12:43.937 --> 12:45.571
I'm not sure you should care.

12:45.606 --> 12:47.572
I told you... she's the
one who put you in that urn.

12:47.607 --> 12:50.209
I have no idea why you'd want
to find someone like that.

12:50.243 --> 12:53.045
Because she is my sister and
she would never do what you say.

12:53.079 --> 12:54.380
Or she's your sister

12:54.414 --> 12:57.316
and she couldn't handle
what you... what we... are,

12:57.350 --> 12:58.984
<i>and she did exactly as I say.</i>

12:59.019 --> 13:00.819
- No!
- Elsa.

13:00.853 --> 13:03.522
[Exhales sharply] Please.

13:03.556 --> 13:05.156
Take it easy. She's
getting under your skin.

13:05.190 --> 13:07.492
Don't let your emotions
cloud your judgment.

13:07.527 --> 13:09.327
If we want answers, we have to be calm.

13:09.361 --> 13:12.030
She knows what happened to Anna.
And we're gonna figure it all out.

13:12.064 --> 13:13.231
You go help David and hook

13:13.265 --> 13:14.733
try to figure out how
to take apart her mirror.

13:14.767 --> 13:16.000
- I got this.
- Emma...

13:16.035 --> 13:17.035
I got it.

13:22.374 --> 13:24.342
Okay. Now it's just me.

13:24.376 --> 13:27.745
Good. You're the one I
wanted to talk to anyway.

13:27.779 --> 13:29.414
Yeah, yeah. I know. You want
me to turn to the dark side

13:29.448 --> 13:30.781
and be your... sister-buddy-something or other.

13:30.816 --> 13:33.284
I'm not interested.

13:33.319 --> 13:35.119
I'm so proud of you, Emma.

13:35.154 --> 13:36.386
No, that's not gonna work.

13:36.421 --> 13:38.221
I know that we have a past,
which we're gonna get into.

13:38.256 --> 13:39.623
But you're not gonna push my buttons.

13:39.658 --> 13:41.291
I'm being completely sincere.

13:41.326 --> 13:43.894
Use your super power... you'll
see I'm telling the truth.

13:46.130 --> 13:47.765
How do you know about that?

13:47.799 --> 13:50.935
You told me. When you were a child.

13:50.969 --> 13:52.769
What a lovely child you were.

13:52.803 --> 13:54.771
I am so grateful I got to know you then.

13:54.805 --> 13:56.406
Don't talk to me like we're friends.

13:56.441 --> 13:59.576
We're not friends, Emma. We're family.

13:59.610 --> 14:01.744
I know that's what you want,
but whatever past we had...

14:01.779 --> 14:03.113
the past you stole from me...

14:03.147 --> 14:04.848
I know enough to tell you about the future.

14:04.882 --> 14:06.749
And what you want? It
ain't gonna happen, sister.

14:06.784 --> 14:08.218
Oh, but it will.

14:08.252 --> 14:10.252
You see, at the end of
the day, you'll understand

14:10.287 --> 14:13.089
that everything that
I've been saying is true.

14:13.123 --> 14:14.924
And then you'll do the
last thing in the world

14:14.959 --> 14:17.093
you'd think possible right now.

14:17.127 --> 14:19.395
Yeah? What's that?

14:19.429 --> 14:22.131
You're going to let me go.

14:24.869 --> 14:26.335
[Sighs]

14:26.370 --> 14:28.837
Now, then...

14:28.872 --> 14:31.740
What would you like to talk about?

14:45.149 --> 14:48.652
[sighs]

14:54.630 --> 14:59.767
Hey, mom. Could you
help me with this thing?

14:59.801 --> 15:02.570
Well, look at you all dressed up.

15:02.604 --> 15:04.972
- What's the occasion?
- I'm getting married.

15:05.642 --> 15:08.943
Work. With grandpa. At the shop.

15:08.977 --> 15:11.279
He said if I was gonna
learn the family business,

15:11.313 --> 15:13.581
I'd have to represent the family business.

15:13.615 --> 15:17.552
Which would be fine if it
didn't also mean wearing a tie.

15:19.922 --> 15:23.390
Well, I think you look very handsome.

15:23.425 --> 15:26.727
[Sighs]

15:26.762 --> 15:30.264
So, what happened?

15:30.298 --> 15:31.599
What do you mean?

15:31.633 --> 15:34.101
You were tearing through the
book with your scary face on.

15:34.135 --> 15:35.734
Did something happen with Robin Hood?

15:35.831 --> 15:37.841
No. I'm just...

15:40.908 --> 15:42.543
I'm moving on.

15:42.577 --> 15:45.379
Whatever he and I had, it's over.

15:45.413 --> 15:47.747
I just need to let it go.

15:48.883 --> 15:50.717
I'm sorry, mom.

15:52.720 --> 15:55.189
But the next time a happy
ending knocks on my door,

15:55.223 --> 15:56.856
I'm gonna be ready.

15:56.891 --> 15:59.893
I'm not gonna let this book stop me again.

15:59.927 --> 16:01.828
From now on...

16:01.862 --> 16:06.232
Operation Mongoose is my main focus.

16:06.266 --> 16:08.568
We will find the author.

16:08.603 --> 16:10.904
Good. And I have a few ideas

16:10.938 --> 16:13.573
about where to look for
clues next in the shop.

16:13.607 --> 16:15.941
Now get to work.

16:20.680 --> 16:23.483
So, the spell of shattered sight.

16:23.517 --> 16:25.585
Pretty impressive stuff.

16:25.619 --> 16:27.820
What does it matter? You stopped me.

16:27.854 --> 16:30.322
That's right. I did. We know who you are.

16:30.356 --> 16:31.824
We know what you're planning.

16:31.858 --> 16:33.325
And we know that for
some sick, twisted reason,

16:33.359 --> 16:35.928
you want Elsa and me to
replace your long-lost sisters.

16:35.962 --> 16:37.763
Well, then, you have all your answers.

16:37.797 --> 16:40.766
- May I retire to my cell now?
- No. I want to know why.

16:40.800 --> 16:43.468
Why have you been
tracking me my whole life?

16:43.503 --> 16:45.504
I was trying to protect you, Emma.

16:45.538 --> 16:46.638
Is that what you were doing

16:46.672 --> 16:47.972
in the foster home, protecting me?

16:48.007 --> 16:50.041
So why did you erase my memories?

16:50.075 --> 16:51.510
<i>Because they were just too good?</i>

16:51.544 --> 16:53.612
Every family has their ups and downs.

16:53.646 --> 16:56.281
You see, no, you and
I... we are not family.

16:56.315 --> 16:57.415
I have one of those,

16:57.450 --> 16:59.784
and it spans three
generations and 400 years.

16:59.818 --> 17:01.453
Family isn't about blood.

17:01.487 --> 17:04.155
It is a bond far stronger
than mere genetics.

17:04.189 --> 17:05.823
Elsa and I are your real family

17:05.858 --> 17:07.157
because we are the only ones like you.

17:07.192 --> 17:08.726
We belong together.

17:08.761 --> 17:12.730
The family that you think you have...

17:12.765 --> 17:15.633
They may love you, but they also fear you.

17:15.667 --> 17:17.167
No. They don't.

17:17.202 --> 17:19.136
You've never seem them wince at your power?

17:19.171 --> 17:21.972
You've never seen a twinge of
panic just behind their eyes?

17:22.006 --> 17:24.508
Not even once? I find that hard to believe.

17:24.542 --> 17:27.310
They love me for who I
am, including my powers.

17:30.182 --> 17:32.683
I thought that once, too, Emma.

17:34.352 --> 17:36.586
Helga: Ingrid, you have to taste this.

17:36.620 --> 17:38.889
The royal Baker really outdid himself.

17:40.457 --> 17:41.658
What are you doing?

17:41.693 --> 17:45.361
I was hoping to be gone
before you returned.

17:45.396 --> 17:47.497
Nonsense.

17:47.531 --> 17:50.167
You were perfectly fine when we left you.

17:50.201 --> 17:51.401
What happened?

17:51.435 --> 17:53.603
I went to the party.

17:53.637 --> 17:57.207
- You did?
- We didn't see you there.

17:57.241 --> 17:59.342
I saw you.

17:59.376 --> 18:01.711
I watched you dancing and laughing.

18:01.745 --> 18:05.615
You looked so vibrant and... and free.

18:05.649 --> 18:07.617
I'm not meant for such things, Helga.

18:07.651 --> 18:08.784
I've accepted that.

18:08.819 --> 18:10.285
When I'm gone,

18:10.320 --> 18:16.258
you'll both be able to have the
normal lives that you deserve.

18:16.292 --> 18:20.429
Your compassion and strength

18:20.463 --> 18:23.833
will make you a wonderful leader, Helga.

18:25.635 --> 18:29.771
[Voice breaking] You are the
Queen that Arendelle deserves.

18:29.805 --> 18:32.140
Ingrid, stop this right now.

18:32.174 --> 18:35.910
I can't control my power. It's too strong.

18:35.945 --> 18:38.213
I don't want to hurt anyone.

18:38.248 --> 18:40.749
Remember what we promised, Ingrid.

18:40.783 --> 18:43.952
<i>We will never abandon each other.</i>

18:43.986 --> 18:46.154
I think I know someone who can help.

18:46.188 --> 18:48.289
What did you say, Gerda?

18:48.323 --> 18:53.128
I've heard whispers of a man, a sorcerer,

18:53.162 --> 18:56.798
who might be powerful enough
to control Ingrid's powers.

18:58.967 --> 19:01.636
Where does this sorcerer live?

19:03.538 --> 19:06.507
He lives in a land called Misthaven.

19:06.541 --> 19:08.576
And his name...

19:08.610 --> 19:12.146
Is Rumplestiltskin.

19:18.119 --> 19:20.754
This is what we've been worried about?

19:20.789 --> 19:23.590
Shouldn't it be shaking
or doing something evil?

19:23.624 --> 19:24.925
Agreed.

19:24.959 --> 19:28.996
It feels like just a
harmless looking glass to me.

19:29.030 --> 19:32.499
I've found nothing to
counteract the spell yet.

19:32.533 --> 19:36.269
<i>Hey, stop! Do not look in that thing.</i>

19:36.304 --> 19:38.505
It'll make you see the worst in yourself.

19:38.539 --> 19:39.773
It must be broken.

19:39.807 --> 19:41.441
I've been staring at it all
day, and I think I'm even

19:41.475 --> 19:43.510
more devilishly handsome
and charming than usual.

19:48.949 --> 19:51.083
Uh... [scoffs]

19:51.118 --> 19:54.486
Th-this isn't the same mirror.

19:54.521 --> 19:57.489
Why would the Snow Queen risk
coming all the way out here

19:57.524 --> 19:58.691
to plant a fake mirror?

19:59.759 --> 20:01.694
Because she wanted to get caught.

20:05.932 --> 20:08.934
[Tinkling]

20:11.404 --> 20:13.405
[Ice crackling]

20:23.549 --> 20:25.984
Emma! Emma!

20:35.167 --> 20:37.469
[Sighs]

20:37.503 --> 20:39.638
[Door bells jingle]

20:48.831 --> 20:50.465
I can explain.

20:50.490 --> 20:53.625
No need.

20:53.650 --> 20:55.607
Another for me.

20:55.649 --> 20:58.484
And one for Mr. Will Scarlet.

20:58.558 --> 21:02.194
I really do want to make amends, you know,

21:02.228 --> 21:04.530
for what I did to you and the
Merry Men at Sherwood Forest.

21:04.564 --> 21:07.199
- You nearly got us all killed.
- Nearly.

21:07.233 --> 21:08.900
Surely that's worth something?

21:08.934 --> 21:12.070
Because of a woman. And where is she now?

21:17.242 --> 21:18.409
Sorry.

21:20.179 --> 21:22.981
I chose my path.

21:23.015 --> 21:26.017
Sometimes even when you win, you lose.

21:28.453 --> 21:30.754
I ever tell you about how I met Marian?

21:30.789 --> 21:32.423
Only about three dozen times.

21:32.457 --> 21:34.225
I stole her father's horse.

21:34.259 --> 21:35.626
Three dozen and one.

21:35.661 --> 21:39.430
I was just a two-bit thief in those days.

21:39.464 --> 21:40.565
I didn't even need it.

21:40.599 --> 21:42.633
Already had two horses back at the camp.

21:42.668 --> 21:44.768
And that night, you woke to
an arrow pointed at your head.

21:44.803 --> 21:46.603
Her family, she said, were poor farmers.

21:46.637 --> 21:47.938
The little that they had

21:47.972 --> 21:50.440
was held together by that prized steed.

21:50.474 --> 21:54.611
I didn't say a word as
she rode off that night.

21:54.645 --> 21:56.446
And the next day, I returned
to her cottage...

21:56.480 --> 21:59.316
With two of your own horses
as a gift to her family.

21:59.350 --> 22:00.383
And from that day forward,

22:00.418 --> 22:02.252
you never stole for yourself again.

22:02.286 --> 22:03.953
From that day forward, you only stole

22:03.987 --> 22:05.422
from the rich and give to the poor.

22:05.456 --> 22:07.724
She made me the man I am today, Will.

22:07.758 --> 22:12.061
I need to remember that.

22:14.365 --> 22:16.333
It wasn't easy for her, you know.

22:16.367 --> 22:20.169
Living like an outlaw.

22:20.204 --> 22:24.473
I asked her once how she gave
up everything to be with you.

22:24.507 --> 22:27.476
Do you know what she told me?

22:27.510 --> 22:28.577
What?

22:28.612 --> 22:32.081
She said, "there's good in him, Will.

22:32.116 --> 22:33.582
And when you see the good in someone,

22:33.617 --> 22:35.251
you don't give up on them...

22:35.285 --> 22:38.454
especially if they don't see it themselves.

22:38.488 --> 22:41.290
And if you're ever lucky
enough to find true love,

22:41.324 --> 22:44.660
you fight for it every day."

22:44.694 --> 22:46.629
Do you still believe that?

22:46.663 --> 22:49.298
<i>After everything you did for love?</i>

22:49.332 --> 22:51.467
- Was it worth it?
- Mate, if you find someone

22:51.501 --> 22:54.803
you love enough to ruin
your entire life for,

22:54.837 --> 22:56.838
it's always worth it.

23:09.251 --> 23:12.353
Okay, I've swept the floor twice.

23:12.388 --> 23:14.188
Don't you think it's time I learned

23:14.222 --> 23:17.024
something a bit more... magical?

23:17.058 --> 23:20.060
Well, Henry, today is your lucky day.

23:20.095 --> 23:22.163
Because I am gonna give you

23:22.197 --> 23:23.831
a potion that possesses the power

23:23.865 --> 23:26.867
to transform something
old into something new.

23:26.902 --> 23:28.635
What kind of potion is that?

23:28.670 --> 23:30.470
Furniture Polish.

23:32.407 --> 23:34.241
You can start in the back.

23:34.276 --> 23:36.443
Don't touch anything you shouldn't.

23:39.580 --> 23:40.981
[Door bell jingles]

23:42.950 --> 23:45.686
Ah, this kind of
procession never bodes well.

23:45.720 --> 23:47.688
The Snow Queen iced over the
locks of the Sheriff's Station.

23:47.722 --> 23:49.088
Emma's trapped inside with her.

23:49.123 --> 23:50.490
Belle: We need your help, Rumple.

23:50.525 --> 23:52.158
You must be able to get us in there.

23:52.193 --> 23:53.827
Elsa: Please.

23:53.861 --> 23:55.662
Please.

23:55.697 --> 23:59.532
How could I turn down the
pleas of my beloved wife?

24:01.068 --> 24:03.036
After you.

24:03.070 --> 24:05.038
[Door bell jingles]

24:05.072 --> 24:07.707
All right, Crocodile. What's your game?

24:09.076 --> 24:11.377
The last two villains that came
into town tried to kill you.

24:11.411 --> 24:13.746
But you seem rather
unconcerned by this one.

24:13.780 --> 24:16.315
Makes a man wonder if
you two have a history.

24:16.350 --> 24:18.451
You can wonder all you like, dearie.

24:18.485 --> 24:22.488
My history... my business.

24:23.657 --> 24:27.092
Ice powers, you say?

24:27.126 --> 24:28.938
And snow.

24:28.963 --> 24:33.198
My, my. How intriguing.
And such a rare gift.

24:33.233 --> 24:35.067
Why would you ever want to give it up?

24:35.101 --> 24:38.103
Perhaps I could interest
you in lessons instead?

24:38.137 --> 24:40.105
No.

24:40.139 --> 24:41.940
I want to stop them.

24:41.975 --> 24:43.775
We heard that you were
the greatest collector

24:43.809 --> 24:45.443
of magic in all the Land.

24:45.478 --> 24:47.212
You must have something that can help.

24:47.247 --> 24:48.980
Well, of course I do, dearie.

24:49.014 --> 24:52.316
The thing I don't
understand is why you need me

24:52.351 --> 24:54.753
<i>when you already have all the help</i>

24:54.787 --> 24:56.621
- you could possibly ask for.
- What do you mean?

24:58.090 --> 24:59.056
[Whoosh]

24:59.091 --> 25:01.893
True love comes in many forms.

25:01.927 --> 25:04.328
But the sisterly bond... oh!

25:04.363 --> 25:07.298
Worth its weight in magic.

25:09.534 --> 25:12.169
My powers are too strong.

25:12.204 --> 25:14.005
I need something to control them.

25:14.039 --> 25:15.572
Well, if you insist.

25:15.607 --> 25:18.242
Just remember. Love is free.

25:18.277 --> 25:21.745
But all magic comes with a price.

25:21.780 --> 25:26.917
These gloves can help conceal your powers.

25:26.951 --> 25:28.118
And stop them?

25:28.152 --> 25:31.588
Well, only if you believe
it. Faith can be powerful.

25:31.623 --> 25:32.923
But for those who lack it,

25:32.957 --> 25:38.628
well, sometimes another
solution is required.

25:40.031 --> 25:43.833
Think of this as your fail-safe.

25:43.867 --> 25:47.437
If things get too chilly,
simply pop the top and in you go.

25:48.973 --> 25:50.941
All your powers will be contained,

25:50.975 --> 25:55.377
and all of the Realms
shall be safe from you.

25:55.412 --> 25:57.146
Problem solved.

25:57.180 --> 25:59.281
[Exhales sharply]

25:59.316 --> 26:02.117
I don't know how you do
things in Arendelle, dearie,

26:02.152 --> 26:06.155
but here a deal requires
an exchange of goods.

26:06.189 --> 26:08.658
What I want is, uh...

26:08.692 --> 26:11.827
These lovely ribbons... all three.

26:12.895 --> 26:15.797
Our ribbons? But they're just

26:15.832 --> 26:18.334
silly little things we've
worn since we were children.

26:18.368 --> 26:22.838
Sometimes, with enough
love, ordinary objects

26:22.872 --> 26:27.008
can come to possess their
own special kind of magic.

26:27.042 --> 26:28.677
Ingrid, no.

26:28.711 --> 26:31.580
We can't give them up. It's not right.

26:31.614 --> 26:35.249
I-I-it's just a symbol.
It's not strong enough.

26:35.284 --> 26:37.251
I need something that will guarantee

26:37.286 --> 26:39.588
that I never hurt anyone again.

26:39.622 --> 26:42.156
Like, he said, a fail-safe.

26:42.191 --> 26:45.626
<i>We are your fail-safe, Ingrid.</i>

26:47.429 --> 26:49.563
Do we have a deal?

26:53.568 --> 26:58.339
I'm sorry. It's not enough.

27:07.048 --> 27:11.184
Deal, deal, deal.

27:11.219 --> 27:14.755
It's understandable you feel upset.

27:14.789 --> 27:16.923
Now you think you know how I feel?

27:16.957 --> 27:18.691
I know you better than
you know yourself, Emma.

27:18.726 --> 27:20.527
Yeah, because you took...
what?... A year from my life?

27:20.561 --> 27:21.661
When you lived with me,

27:21.695 --> 27:23.663
you talked about your parents all the time.

27:23.697 --> 27:24.864
You were so angry with
them for giving you up.

27:24.899 --> 27:27.600
They had a good reason
for that. I know that now.

27:27.635 --> 27:29.436
It doesn't change the
fact that you felt unwanted

27:29.470 --> 27:32.039
- for 28 years.
- They didn't have a choice.

27:32.073 --> 27:34.574
There is always a choice,
Emma. They could have kept you.

27:34.608 --> 27:36.809
They could have figured out something else.

27:36.844 --> 27:37.977
They could have tried.

27:38.012 --> 27:40.613
They did what they could
to save an entire Kingdom.

27:40.648 --> 27:42.448
You were their only child.

27:42.482 --> 27:44.617
And they used you to break a curse.

27:44.652 --> 27:46.786
They're still using your powers.

27:46.820 --> 27:48.988
- That's not true.
- Isn't it?

27:49.023 --> 27:51.257
How many times have you saved them?

27:51.291 --> 27:52.925
How often have you felt
more like a "Savior"

27:52.959 --> 27:54.460
than their daughter?

27:54.494 --> 27:59.731
And all it takes is one
tiny mistake, one accident,

27:59.766 --> 28:02.568
and you and your powers go
from being their salvation

28:02.602 --> 28:05.104
- to their worst nightmare.
- You don't know them or me.

28:05.138 --> 28:07.105
I don't have to know you, Emma.

28:07.139 --> 28:08.506
<i>I've been you...</i>

28:08.541 --> 28:11.944
different, misunderstood, alone.

28:11.978 --> 28:17.182
And now they've chosen to have a new child.

28:17.216 --> 28:20.351
And don't you think that they thank

28:20.386 --> 28:25.790
their lucky stars every
day that he was born normal?

28:25.824 --> 28:29.026
They love me.

28:29.061 --> 28:30.495
[Bubbling]

28:30.529 --> 28:33.498
You can't love somebody
you don't understand.

28:33.532 --> 28:34.832
And do you know what happens

28:34.866 --> 28:36.834
when people don't understand something?

28:36.868 --> 28:38.103
They learn to fear it.

28:38.137 --> 28:39.971
And then they look at it like a monster!

28:40.005 --> 28:41.973
- Shut up!
- [Whoosh]

28:46.244 --> 28:47.945
W-what did you do to me?

28:47.980 --> 28:49.981
- [Chains rattle]
- Ah.

28:50.015 --> 28:52.316
All I did is show you who you really are.

28:52.350 --> 28:54.952
M-make it stop.

28:54.987 --> 28:56.620
I can't.

28:56.654 --> 29:01.524
It's you, Emma, and... It's beautiful.

29:01.558 --> 29:02.525
[Whoosh]

29:02.559 --> 29:05.027
[Wind howling]

29:23.467 --> 29:26.071
What have I done?

29:26.096 --> 29:27.687
David: Emma! You all right?

29:27.721 --> 29:29.156
- We were so worried.
- Wait!

29:29.190 --> 29:31.158
Seems you didn't need my help after all.

29:31.192 --> 29:34.361
Swan, what did that monster
do to the Sheriff's Station?

29:34.395 --> 29:37.397
The "monster" who did this was
not the Snow Queen. It was me.

29:37.432 --> 29:38.598
What?

29:38.632 --> 29:40.199
Just keep your distance.

29:40.233 --> 29:42.535
I don't know if I can control myself.

29:42.570 --> 29:43.903
I don't want to hurt anyone.

29:43.938 --> 29:45.171
- Swan.
- We should heed her words.

29:45.205 --> 29:47.073
- Emma, we can help.
- Just stay away! Let me go!

29:47.107 --> 29:49.709
- [Electricity crackles, metal creaks]
- Ooh.

29:52.212 --> 29:53.880
Watch out!

29:53.914 --> 29:56.648
- [Groans]
- David!

29:58.785 --> 30:01.587
[Groans]

30:01.621 --> 30:03.355
[Gasps]

30:03.390 --> 30:05.757
Emma!

30:05.792 --> 30:07.560
Emma...

30:07.594 --> 30:09.562
Emma, wait.

30:09.813 --> 30:10.946
Please come back.

30:10.971 --> 30:11.937
- Swan!
- Mom!

30:11.965 --> 30:13.364
It's okay!

30:13.399 --> 30:15.333
Emma!

30:17.403 --> 30:18.937
[Engine revs]

30:25.511 --> 30:27.512
[Birds chirping]

30:34.453 --> 30:37.755
Duke: Ah, the Golden Crocus.

30:37.789 --> 30:39.328
A mysterious flower

30:39.358 --> 30:42.327
that blooms only for those
who are willing to wait.

30:44.796 --> 30:47.654
I don't believe we've had the pleasure.

30:48.545 --> 30:50.000
Ingrid.

30:52.137 --> 30:54.539
You must be here for Helga.
I'll go and fetch her for you.

30:54.573 --> 30:58.209
Yeah, I-I'd heard rumors of
this mysterious third sister,

30:58.244 --> 31:01.511
- but I had to see her for myself.
- Oh.

31:01.546 --> 31:04.581
The stories did not lie.

31:04.616 --> 31:06.784
You are more beautiful and intriguing

31:06.818 --> 31:08.685
than I could have ever imagined.

31:09.520 --> 31:11.254
Did I say that out loud?

31:11.288 --> 31:14.257
[Laughs] Of course I did.

31:14.291 --> 31:16.092
Oh, you are enchanting.

31:16.126 --> 31:18.450
Oh, no. Don't do this.

31:18.475 --> 31:20.630
Helga will never know.

31:20.664 --> 31:22.727
- She loves you.
- [Sighs]

31:22.766 --> 31:28.422
<i>But it's you that I want,
you mysterious flower...</i>

31:28.472 --> 31:30.039
The Queen to be.

31:30.073 --> 31:32.542
No, no, no, no, no, no!

31:32.576 --> 31:34.442
- Get back!
- [Whoosh]

31:36.179 --> 31:37.312
[Exhales sharply]

31:37.346 --> 31:38.547
[Coughs]

31:38.581 --> 31:42.384
What dark sorcery is this?

31:42.418 --> 31:44.720
Stay away from me.

31:44.754 --> 31:46.565
Please, don't tell anyone.

31:46.623 --> 31:48.390
Please.

31:48.424 --> 31:50.559
This has to be our secret.

31:50.593 --> 31:52.026
Helga: Ingrid.

31:54.130 --> 31:57.332
Ingrid, what's going on here?

31:58.634 --> 32:01.503
Your sister started kissing me.

32:01.537 --> 32:04.939
- [Scoffs]
- She told me she loved me.

32:04.974 --> 32:06.108
And when I rebuffed
her, she tried to kill me

32:06.142 --> 32:08.309
with... with her magic.

32:08.343 --> 32:10.111
No! Helga, no.

32:10.145 --> 32:11.278
Thank you, Duke.

32:11.313 --> 32:12.981
That is not...

32:13.015 --> 32:14.649
thank you for showing me what a...

32:14.683 --> 32:16.450
Liar and a scoundrel you are,

32:16.485 --> 32:18.520
and for saving me the trouble

32:18.554 --> 32:21.890
of considering taking your
worthless hand in marriage.

32:21.924 --> 32:23.857
How dare you?

32:23.892 --> 32:27.161
We shall see to it that your
diplomatic mission here is over.

32:27.195 --> 32:30.131
And we shall send you
straight back to "Weaselton."

32:30.165 --> 32:33.967
It's pronounced "Wesel-ton."

32:34.002 --> 32:37.871
And I am its Duke, and I
do not take orders from you.

32:37.906 --> 32:40.874
Believe me, when Arendelle
learns the truth about her,

32:40.909 --> 32:42.475
they shall side with me.

32:43.945 --> 32:47.748
Ingrid is my sister, and
I love her for who she is.

32:47.782 --> 32:50.083
And so shall everyone else.

32:50.117 --> 32:51.418
Really?

32:51.452 --> 32:55.221
Is this why you hide her away
from balls and royal dinners?

32:55.256 --> 32:57.723
Why no one has ever
laid eyes on this freak?

32:57.758 --> 33:01.027
You are out of line, "Weasel-ton."

33:01.062 --> 33:04.264
Mock me all you want, but
the people deserve to know

33:04.298 --> 33:06.566
what their future Queen is.

33:06.600 --> 33:08.734
Before I'm through, all of
Arendelle will know your secret.

33:08.769 --> 33:10.903
And when they find out how
dangerous your sister really is,

33:10.938 --> 33:12.772
you won't have to hide her any longer

33:12.806 --> 33:15.007
because they'll lock her
up and throw away the key.

33:15.042 --> 33:17.877
- Enough!
- Because that is the only fate

33:17.911 --> 33:19.745
befitting a monster.

33:19.780 --> 33:20.947
Stop!

33:20.981 --> 33:21.948
- [Whoosh]
- No!

33:21.982 --> 33:23.583
[Ice crackling]

33:23.617 --> 33:25.317
N-no! No!

33:26.119 --> 33:27.753
Helga!

33:27.788 --> 33:30.522
- Helga, no. Helga.
- Ohh.

33:32.125 --> 33:33.758
Helga.

33:33.793 --> 33:35.727
Helga, hey.

33:35.761 --> 33:37.862
I'm so sorry.

33:37.897 --> 33:40.031
H-Helga...

33:40.066 --> 33:41.066
No.

33:45.305 --> 33:47.572
I... no! No! No!

33:47.607 --> 33:51.109
[Sobbing] No!

33:51.143 --> 33:53.111
[Gasping]

33:55.948 --> 33:58.750
What have I done?

34:08.234 --> 34:10.568
[Footsteps approach]

34:13.237 --> 34:17.487
Why am I getting a sense of déjà vu?

34:17.512 --> 34:19.261
Regina...

34:19.286 --> 34:23.717
I have lived by a code my entire life...

34:23.751 --> 34:26.552
steal from the rich and give to the poor.

34:26.585 --> 34:30.056
Be truthful, righteous, and good.

34:30.090 --> 34:34.060
I have tried to live by that
code every day of my life.

34:35.295 --> 34:37.263
Then why are you here?

34:37.297 --> 34:39.065
'Cause today is not one of those days.

34:59.752 --> 35:02.087
Did you find her?

35:02.121 --> 35:06.091
No. We looked everywhere,
which means only one thing.

35:06.125 --> 35:07.625
She doesn't want to be found.

35:07.660 --> 35:09.061
Elsa: I've been through this.

35:09.095 --> 35:11.396
And I saw the same looks
on my loved ones' faces

35:11.431 --> 35:13.731
as Emma just did.

35:13.766 --> 35:15.767
I saw fear.

35:15.801 --> 35:18.536
David, we failed today.

35:18.571 --> 35:21.773
When our daughter needed us
most, she looked in our eyes,

35:21.807 --> 35:24.976
and... all she saw was fear.

35:25.010 --> 35:27.078
- [Sighs]
- This Snow Queen has

35:27.112 --> 35:28.913
some mirror that turns
us against each other?

35:28.948 --> 35:31.748
Well, she doesn't need it. Look at us.

35:31.783 --> 35:35.286
[Breathes deeply] We are
doing it to ourselves.

35:38.490 --> 35:40.491
[Insects chirping]

35:52.036 --> 35:55.706
[Breathes deeply]

36:07.218 --> 36:09.719
[Sobbing]

36:12.656 --> 36:15.958
Ingrid? Ingrid, what happened?

36:15.993 --> 36:17.793
Where's hel... [Gasps]

36:19.896 --> 36:22.297
[Sobbing] I didn't mean to.

36:22.332 --> 36:24.333
What did you do?

36:24.367 --> 36:28.303
- [Sniffles]
- What did you do?!

36:28.338 --> 36:29.972
[Crying] I was trying to stop the Duke.

36:30.007 --> 36:32.008
- It was an accident. You have to believe me.
- [Gasps]

36:32.042 --> 36:33.809
- You stay away from me. Stay!
- No!

36:33.844 --> 36:37.546
No. Please... please, don't be afraid.

36:37.580 --> 36:39.714
We said that we would always
be there for each other.

36:39.749 --> 36:43.718
We made a promise. I love you.

36:43.753 --> 36:47.055
Gerda, please, you have to help me.

36:47.089 --> 36:48.357
Take my hand.

36:48.391 --> 36:52.461
Please take my hand.

36:52.495 --> 36:54.629
You're all I have left.

36:54.664 --> 36:58.867
Ingrid... you killed our sister.

36:58.901 --> 37:01.670
[Inhales sharply] You're...

37:01.704 --> 37:04.172
You're a monster.

37:06.742 --> 37:09.843
No, G-Gerda, no.

37:17.052 --> 37:18.219
No! No!

37:18.253 --> 37:19.320
[Whoosh]

37:25.760 --> 37:27.695
[Grunts]

37:27.729 --> 37:30.497
[Sobs]

37:45.112 --> 37:50.083
Grand Pabbie: Your face
shows great tragedy, my child.

37:50.117 --> 37:53.086
I lost both my sisters today.

37:53.120 --> 37:56.423
Oh, I am so sorry.

37:56.457 --> 37:59.058
How did such a thing happen?

37:59.093 --> 38:02.628
It's too painful to talk about.

38:02.662 --> 38:06.799
But my pain has to be set aside.

38:06.834 --> 38:09.869
We need to see that
Arendelle survives this.

38:09.903 --> 38:13.639
Which is where I need your help.

38:13.673 --> 38:17.976
I need a memory potion strong enough

38:18.010 --> 38:19.478
to make all the realm forget

38:19.512 --> 38:21.880
that Ingrid and Helga ever existed.

38:21.914 --> 38:24.983
My father, the Duke of Weselton,

38:25.017 --> 38:28.153
everyone within our borders must forget.

38:28.187 --> 38:30.155
Can you do this?

38:30.189 --> 38:31.890
Yes.

38:31.924 --> 38:33.725
But, my dear, I must warn you,

38:33.760 --> 38:37.295
the truth has a way of coming
out, one way or the other.

38:37.329 --> 38:38.797
It mustn't.

38:38.831 --> 38:41.800
The future of the Kingdom depends on it.

38:41.834 --> 38:45.670
I will do this for you.

38:45.704 --> 38:46.772
[Sighs]

38:46.806 --> 38:49.940
But this is strong magic that you speak of.

38:49.975 --> 38:54.145
And magic always comes with a price.

38:54.179 --> 38:59.016
I... I'm fairly certain
I've already paid it.

39:03.889 --> 39:07.391
We shall see.

39:09.161 --> 39:11.662
[Door bells jingle]

39:13.598 --> 39:18.068
As someone who's created
many monsters in his time,

39:18.103 --> 39:21.605
I am impressed by the
number you did on Ms. Swan.

39:24.975 --> 39:28.111
I'm ready to make that deal.

39:28.145 --> 39:31.682
So...

39:31.716 --> 39:35.719
You finally understand what
you didn't so many years ago.

39:35.753 --> 39:39.555
I want my ribbons back.

39:39.589 --> 39:41.724
Then you'll also understand

39:41.758 --> 39:45.328
that a... a deal requires
an exchange of goods.

39:45.362 --> 39:48.731
And I'm no longer convinced
you have anything I want.

39:48.765 --> 39:51.067
You still need one more thing

39:51.101 --> 39:53.069
to cleave yourself from that dagger.

39:53.103 --> 39:57.306
And how do you know about that?

39:57.341 --> 40:01.711
I had that hat longer than you.

40:01.745 --> 40:05.214
I learned many things.

40:05.248 --> 40:10.219
Among them... the missing
piece of your puzzle.

40:10.253 --> 40:13.688
Give me my ribbon. I'll
tell you what it is.

40:13.723 --> 40:17.092
You see, I've figured out your plan.

40:17.126 --> 40:24.266
Storybrooke... is a small town.

40:24.300 --> 40:27.102
Too small for someone

40:27.136 --> 40:32.340
as powerful as the dark one to be content.

40:32.375 --> 40:34.509
Well, they did close down

40:34.543 --> 40:38.413
that ice-cream parlor I was so fond of.

40:38.447 --> 40:41.082
You want to cleave yourself from the dagger

40:41.116 --> 40:43.117
so you can venture outside Storybrooke

40:43.151 --> 40:46.754
without losing your power
or your precious Belle.

40:50.425 --> 40:54.195
You want, in short, what all villains want.

40:54.229 --> 40:56.397
And what's that?

41:00.135 --> 41:02.436
[Gasps]

41:02.470 --> 41:05.606
Everything.

41:05.640 --> 41:07.875
And I want to give it to you.

41:07.909 --> 41:10.711
What makes you so generous?

41:16.350 --> 41:19.485
What you want is out there.

41:19.520 --> 41:22.989
And everything that I want is in here.

41:23.024 --> 41:28.128
- [Ice crackling]
- Do what you want with the rest of the world.

41:28.162 --> 41:30.830
Storybrooke will be mine.

41:33.267 --> 41:36.436
Do you want your answer?

41:38.539 --> 41:41.173
You know I do.

41:41.207 --> 41:43.876
Then we have a deal.

41:47.180 --> 41:49.348
You first.

41:52.218 --> 41:54.886
Tell me what I require.

41:59.960 --> 42:02.294
[Indistinct whispering]

42:04.230 --> 42:09.033
Not only can I do that...

42:09.068 --> 42:12.270
But I shall do it with great pleasure.
