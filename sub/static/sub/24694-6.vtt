IN NEW YORK CITY'S WAR ON CRIME,

00:04.801 --> 00:06.434
THE WORST CRIMINAL OFFENDERS
ARE PURSUED

00:06.434 --> 00:08.901
BY THE DETECTIVES
OF THE MAJOR CASE SQUAD.

00:08.901 --> 00:10.968
THESE ARE THEIR STORIES.

00:15.667 --> 00:17.667
>> [Irish accent]
THIS ONE'S ON ME.

00:17.667 --> 00:22.133
BUT...YOU HAVE
TO PROMISE ME ONE THING.

00:22.133 --> 00:23.367
CALL ME.

00:33.701 --> 00:35.400
>> IS THAT NEAR PENNSYLVANIA
OR SOMETHING?

00:35.400 --> 00:37.634
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

00:37.634 --> 00:39.334
>> THAT'S HILARIOUS.
>> I KNOW.

00:39.334 --> 00:41.367
[laughing]

00:41.367 --> 00:43.200
[laughs]

00:43.200 --> 00:44.667
>> AH, I LIKE THAT.

00:49.434 --> 00:53.133
LET'S TAKE IT SLOW.

00:53.133 --> 00:54.701
I'D LIKE TO SEE YOU AGAIN.

00:54.701 --> 00:56.801
>> UM...

00:56.801 --> 00:58.567
THERE'S SOMETHING
I HAVE TO TELL YOU

00:58.567 --> 01:01.534
IF WE'RE GONNA
GO ANY FURTHER.

01:01.534 --> 01:04.132
I HAVE A SEVEN-YEAR-OLD SON.

01:07.701 --> 01:09.634
>> I LOOK FORWARD
TO MEETING HIM.

01:18.834 --> 01:20.834
>> [snarling]

01:20.834 --> 01:22.367
>> DO YOU WANT
TO TAKE HIM HOME?

01:22.367 --> 01:23.801
>> CAN I, MOM?

01:23.801 --> 01:25.901
>> SURE, HE CAN SLEEP
IN YOUR BEDROOM.

01:25.901 --> 01:28.367
IF HE MAKES TOO MUCH NOISE,
I'LL BRING HIM BACK.

01:40.767 --> 01:43.167
SHH, SHH, SHH, SHH.

01:43.167 --> 01:45.100
DON'T WAKE HIM UP.

01:54.000 --> 01:57.300
>> YOU'RE REALLY
GETTING TO HIM.

01:57.300 --> 02:00.400
I HAVEN'T SEEN HIM THIS HAPPY
IN A LONG TIME.

02:00.400 --> 02:02.033
>> HE'S A GREAT KID.

02:29.968 --> 02:32.167
>> HEY...WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

02:32.167 --> 02:36.400
>> UH, JUST FILLING OUT
MY HOURS FOR WORK.

02:36.400 --> 02:40.000
WE CAN DO IT ONLINE.

02:40.000 --> 02:41.334
>> [laughs]

03:19.534 --> 03:20.534
>> LET'S GO.

03:26.334 --> 03:27.367
>> GET DOWN!
GET DOWN!

03:30.167 --> 03:32.000
>> UHH!

03:32.000 --> 03:34.701
[tires screech]

03:48.534 --> 03:49.901
[tires screech]

03:49.901 --> 03:51.834
[squeaking]

03:55.534 --> 03:57.467
[car engine humming]

04:59.167 --> 05:01.000
>> I WOKE UP THE OWNER
OF THE MANAGEMENT COMPANY.

05:01.000 --> 05:02.767
THEY RENTED THE GARAGE
TO A BOB SMITH.

05:02.767 --> 05:04.868
715 WEST 23RD, BUT...

05:04.868 --> 05:07.033
>> NUMBERS ON 23RD STREET
DON'T GO THAT HIGH,

05:07.033 --> 05:08.934
SO WE CAN ASSUME
THAT HIS NAME ISN'T BOB.

05:08.934 --> 05:10.100
>> OR SMITH.

05:10.100 --> 05:11.667
THEY PAID IN CASH
LAST JUNE 2ND.

05:11.667 --> 05:12.901
TWO-YEAR RENTAL.

05:12.901 --> 05:14.701
AND, ACCORDING TO THE THREE
COMPANY EMPLOYEES,

05:14.701 --> 05:16.234
HE WAS BLACK,
WHITE, OR ASIAN,

05:16.234 --> 05:18.767
AND IN HIS 20s, 30s,
OR 40s.

05:18.767 --> 05:21.067
>> HEH HEH, MEMORY'S
A WONDERFUL THING, ISN'T IT?

05:21.067 --> 05:22.400
>> IT'S AMMONIA.

05:22.400 --> 05:23.767
KEROSENE.
>> MM-HMM.

05:23.767 --> 05:25.934
>> THE BOMBER USED
AMMONIUM NITRATE FERTILIZER.

05:25.934 --> 05:28.868
ADD AN ACCELERANT, AND BOOM,
YOU DESTROY THE VAN.

05:28.868 --> 05:30.901
>> WELL, HE GOT THE GUY
HE WAS AFTER.

05:30.901 --> 05:33.167
>> HOW SO?

05:33.167 --> 05:35.734
>> PADLOCK ON THE DOOR--
OPEN.

05:35.734 --> 05:39.267
KEY TO THE BACK OF THE VAN
STILL IN THE DOOR.

05:39.267 --> 05:42.100
THE VICTIM HAD BOTH KEYS.
HE'S NOT BREAKING IN.

05:42.100 --> 05:43.868
THIS IS WHAT
THE BOMBER WANTED.

05:43.868 --> 05:46.267
>> SO NOW YOU'RE READING
HIS MIND, DR. FREUD?

05:46.267 --> 05:48.868
>> DETECTIVES...
A BALLISTIC MATERIAL.

05:48.868 --> 05:51.667
USED TO TRANSPORT
SOMETHING WORTH PROTECTING.

05:54.334 --> 05:56.033
>> DOES HE HAVE
A LICENSE PLATE UP FRONT?

05:56.033 --> 05:57.200
>> BOTH GONE.

05:57.200 --> 05:59.100
>> CAN YOU GET A VIN NUMBER?
>> FRAGMENTS.

05:59.100 --> 06:00.400
WE'LL PIECE IT TOGETHER.

06:03.801 --> 06:05.234
>> [murmuring]

06:07.067 --> 06:10.767
>> MR. RED JACKET...

06:10.767 --> 06:11.934
IS ALEX CARLISLE,

06:11.934 --> 06:14.734
LATE OF LONG ISLAND CITY.

06:14.734 --> 06:17.234
GEE, THIS IS INTERESTING.

06:17.234 --> 06:18.767
WHAT ARE WE SUPPOSED
TO BE LOOKING AT HERE?

06:18.767 --> 06:20.767
>> WE ARE SUPPOSED TO BE
LOOKING AT A VELCRO STRIP

06:20.767 --> 06:22.601
HANGING OFF THE BALLISTIC
MATERIAL

06:22.601 --> 06:23.901
IN THE BLOWN-UP VAN.

06:23.901 --> 06:25.133
>> SPAGHETTI.

06:25.133 --> 06:27.767
>> MAGNIFIED 35 TIMES.

06:27.767 --> 06:29.367
IT WAS TAGGED
WITH NANO-FIBERS

06:29.367 --> 06:31.601
SO IT COULD BE IDENTIFIED
IF THE BAGS WERE STOLEN.

06:31.601 --> 06:34.234
IT'S A SECURITY DEVICE
USED IN THOUSANDS OF PRODUCTS:

06:34.234 --> 06:36.501
OIL, CLOTHING,
EVEN SOME FOODS.

06:36.501 --> 06:37.767
>> SPAGHETTI?

06:37.767 --> 06:39.934
>> UH, IF IT WAS ESPECIALLY
VALUABLE SPAGHETTI.

06:39.934 --> 06:41.501
>> WOW. CAN YOU TASTE IT?

06:41.501 --> 06:42.767
>> NO, NO.

06:42.767 --> 06:44.434
IF IT WAS FOOD,
THEY'D USE AN EDIBLE STARCH.

06:44.434 --> 06:45.601
>> HMM.

06:45.601 --> 06:47.167
SO IF YOU AND I WENT
TO AN ITALIAN RESTAURANT

06:47.167 --> 06:48.400
AND ORDERED SPAGHETTI,

06:48.400 --> 06:50.667
MARKERS WOULD HAVE NO, UH,
NO HARMFUL EFFECT?

06:50.667 --> 06:52.234
>> [whispers] NO.

06:52.234 --> 06:53.634
[giggles]

06:53.634 --> 06:54.968
>> YOU FOUND SOMETHING?

06:54.968 --> 06:57.601
>> UH, THE FABRIC IN THE VAN
IS FROM BAGS

06:57.601 --> 06:59.567
USED BY
DBC SECURITY NETWORKS.

06:59.567 --> 07:01.434
>> ONE OF ITS ARMORED TRUCKS
WAS ROBBED SIX MONTHS AGO

07:01.434 --> 07:02.501
BY A THREE-MAN TEAM.

07:02.501 --> 07:04.634
>> ONE OF WHOM
WAS NO DOUBTEDLY

07:04.634 --> 07:06.133
OUR VICTIM
MR. CARLISLE.

07:06.133 --> 07:07.267
HIS RECORD CAME IN.

07:07.267 --> 07:08.934
JUVENILE ARRESTS
FOR CHECK KITING,

07:08.934 --> 07:10.200
TICKET SCALPING.

07:10.200 --> 07:11.334
>> BIG LEAP TO ARMED ROBBERY.

07:11.334 --> 07:13.033
>> HE GREW UP.

07:13.033 --> 07:15.400
LET'S GO DIG UP THE FILES
ON THAT DBC ROBBERY.

07:15.400 --> 07:16.968
>> HMM.

07:16.968 --> 07:18.400
SPAGHETTI.

07:18.400 --> 07:20.234
WE OWE IT TO SCIENCE.

07:22.701 --> 07:24.200
>> "WITNESSES
TO THE ARMORED TRUCK ROBBERY

07:24.200 --> 07:27.267
"DESCRIBED
A WHITE ECONOLINE VAN

07:27.267 --> 07:28.334
"AND THREE MEN,

07:28.334 --> 07:30.300
ONE IN A RED
LEATHER JACKET."

07:30.300 --> 07:34.300
>> MR. CARLISLE,
WHO JUST GOT BLOWN UP.

07:34.300 --> 07:37.801
SO ONE'S DEAD, AND WE HAVE
TO LOOK FOR THE OTHER TWO.

07:37.801 --> 07:39.934
EITHER THEY SPLIT
THE MONEY...

07:39.934 --> 07:41.400
>> OR ONE OF THEM HAS IT,

07:41.400 --> 07:43.300
AND HE'S HOPING TO GET RID
OF THE THIRD GUY...

07:43.300 --> 07:45.467
WHICH MEANS WHOEVER
DIDN'T SET THIS BOMB

07:45.467 --> 07:46.868
IS WONDERING IF HE'S NEXT.

07:46.868 --> 07:48.000
>> SEE WHAT I MEAN?

07:48.000 --> 07:49.601
HE INSISTS ON FINISHING
MY SENTENCES.

07:49.601 --> 07:51.100
>> [chuckles]

07:51.100 --> 07:54.000
THE ARMORED TRUCK
WAS FILLING ATM MACHINES.

07:54.000 --> 07:55.667
THE BILLS WERE NEW,
SEQUENTIALLY NUMBERED.

07:55.667 --> 07:57.701
NOW, THIS IS INTERESTING.

07:57.701 --> 07:58.934
THE TRUCK WAS HIT
RIGHT BEFORE

07:58.934 --> 08:01.133
THE FIRST ATM STOP
OF THE DAY.

08:01.133 --> 08:02.701
>> WHEN THEY'D HAVE
THE MOST CASH.

08:02.701 --> 08:03.934
INSIDE JOB?

08:03.934 --> 08:05.334
>> THAT WAS THE THINKING
AT THE TIME.

08:05.334 --> 08:07.901
GUYS WORKING THE CASE
SAID THERE WERE TWO LIKELIES.

08:07.901 --> 08:10.634
NUMBER ONE, LEO CIPRIOTTI.

08:10.634 --> 08:13.868
HE WAS ONE OF THE GUARDS
IN THE ARMORED TRUCK.

08:13.868 --> 08:15.901
>> WE KNOW WHERE HE IS NOW?

08:15.901 --> 08:18.033
>> RAISED A STINK ABOUT
P.T.S.D.

08:18.033 --> 08:20.834
HE'S RETIRED,
FULL DISABILITY.

08:20.834 --> 08:22.534
>> LOOK AT HIM
IN THIS PICTURE.

08:22.534 --> 08:24.501
AY! WHAT A MOOK.

08:24.501 --> 08:26.667
LOOK AT THAT,
HOW HE LEANS HIS HEAD BACK,

08:26.667 --> 08:28.300
CREATES A DISTANCE.

08:28.300 --> 08:29.701
SUPERIORITY.

08:29.701 --> 08:33.534
>> CONTESTANT NUMBER TWO,
HELEN BRAMER.

08:33.534 --> 08:36.534
DBC OFFICE EMPLOYEE.

08:36.534 --> 08:38.701
DELIVERY SCHEDULE
COORDINATOR.

08:38.701 --> 08:40.000
>> YEAH, DETECTIVES
WHO CAUGHT THE CASE

08:40.000 --> 08:41.133
SAID SHE HAD
FINANCIAL TROUBLES.

08:41.133 --> 08:42.567
THEY HAD A FEELING
ABOUT HER,

08:42.567 --> 08:44.067
SAT ON HER
FOR A COUPLE MONTHS.

08:44.067 --> 08:45.100
NOTHING.

08:45.100 --> 08:46.767
>> AND HER CURRENT
WHEREABOUTS?

08:46.767 --> 08:48.767
>> STILL AT DBC.

08:52.901 --> 08:55.701
>> I DON'T KNOW WHAT I CAN ADD
TO WHAT I ALREADY

08:55.701 --> 08:57.300
TOLD THE OTHER DETECTIVES.

08:57.300 --> 08:59.834
>> OH, YOU NEVER KNOW
WHAT MIGHT JUST, UH,

08:59.834 --> 09:00.934
BUBBLE UP, YOU KNOW.

09:00.934 --> 09:02.434
WE'RE JUST GABBING.

09:02.434 --> 09:04.934
>> HAVE A SEAT.

09:06.834 --> 09:10.434
HAVE YOU EVER TOLD ANYONE
ABOUT THE ARMORED CAR ROUTES?

09:10.434 --> 09:13.100
>> NO, I WOULDN'T DO THAT.

09:13.100 --> 09:15.634
I'LL CUT TO THE CHASE
AND SAY THE SAME THING

09:15.634 --> 09:17.467
I SAID TO THE OTHER COPS.

09:17.467 --> 09:18.634
YOU SHOULD TALK TO LEO.

09:18.634 --> 09:20.100
LEO CIPRIOTTI.

09:20.100 --> 09:22.968
>> YOU THINK LEO
TIPPED SOMEBODY OFF?

09:24.567 --> 09:26.334
>> THE GUARDS NEVER
KNOW THEIR ROUTE

09:26.334 --> 09:27.934
UNTIL THE NIGHT
BEFORE A RUN,

09:27.934 --> 09:32.400
AND LEO WAS ALWAYS
ASKING FOR INFORMATION.

09:32.400 --> 09:33.934
>> ABOUT...

09:33.934 --> 09:36.734
>> MY LOVE LIFE.

09:36.734 --> 09:39.400
MY KID.

09:39.400 --> 09:40.968
AND THEN, ALL OF A SUDDEN,

09:40.968 --> 09:44.567
HE'D ASK ABOUT WORK.

09:44.567 --> 09:47.234
>> DID YOU TWO EVER DATE?

09:47.234 --> 09:48.300
>> NO.

09:48.300 --> 09:50.334
IT'S AGAINST THE RULES.

09:52.434 --> 09:53.534
>> HELEN...

09:57.000 --> 09:58.434
YOU DATED LEO, RIGHT?

09:58.434 --> 10:01.534
>> IT WAS JUST
A COUPLE OF DATES.

10:03.701 --> 10:06.434
PLEASE, I CAN'T
LOSE THIS JOB.

10:15.100 --> 10:16.033
>> LEO CIPRIOTTI?

10:19.434 --> 10:21.667
>> THE DBC SECURITY JOB?

10:21.667 --> 10:24.167
>> IT'S THE SHOES.

10:24.167 --> 10:26.400
POLICE OFFICERS
ALL HAVE THE SAME SHOES.

10:26.400 --> 10:28.133
>> IT'S ALWAYS THE GUARDS,
ISN'T IT?

10:28.133 --> 10:30.467
>> WHAT WOULD MAKE US
THINK OTHERWISE, LEO?

10:30.467 --> 10:31.467
>> IF I'M INVOLVED,

10:31.467 --> 10:32.634
HOW COME THE GUYS
ROBBED THE TRUCK

10:32.634 --> 10:34.200
SMACKED ME UP SO GOOD?

10:34.200 --> 10:35.667
>> MAYBE THEY GIVE YOU
A LITTLE TAP,

10:35.667 --> 10:36.934
ROBBERY SEEMS KOSHER.

10:36.934 --> 10:39.734
>> OH, YEAH,
YOU GOT ME, PERRY MASON.

10:39.734 --> 10:41.234
20 STITCHES
AND A CRACKED SKULL

10:41.234 --> 10:43.267
IS MORE THAN A LITTLE TAP.

10:43.267 --> 10:45.567
AH, YOU BEEN TALKING
TO THAT HELEN BROAD

10:45.567 --> 10:47.167
FROM DBC?

10:47.167 --> 10:48.734
SHE'S YOUR WEAK LINK.

10:48.734 --> 10:50.167
NOT MUCH SHE WOULDN'T DO
TO GET ATTENTION,

10:50.167 --> 10:51.334
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

10:51.334 --> 10:53.601
>> GET ANY
OF THAT ATTENTION YOURSELF?

10:53.601 --> 10:56.601
>> WE WENT OUT FOR DRINKS
A COUPLE OF TIMES.

10:56.601 --> 10:58.200
BUT I DON'T LIKE WOMEN
LOOKING FOR A MAN

10:58.200 --> 10:59.968
TO DADDY UP
FOR THEIR KID.

10:59.968 --> 11:01.901
CAN I GET BACK TO MY GAME?

11:01.901 --> 11:03.434
>> WELL,
DON'T OVERDO IT, LEO.

11:03.434 --> 11:04.868
ONCE YOU GET
KICKED OFF DISABILITY,

11:04.868 --> 11:06.567
IT'S HARD TO GET BACK ON.

11:11.667 --> 11:13.467
>> I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT
ABOUT HELEN BRAMER.

11:13.467 --> 11:14.634
SHE'S AFRAID.

11:14.634 --> 11:17.100
SHE SEEMS TIRED, BEAT UP.

11:19.167 --> 11:20.701
>> LOOK AT HER.

11:20.701 --> 11:22.300
LOOK AT LEO CIPRIOTTI.

11:22.300 --> 11:23.501
YOU WONDER WHY SHE'D EVEN

11:23.501 --> 11:25.400
WANT TO GO FOR A DRINK
WITH THIS GUY.

11:25.400 --> 11:28.067
BET SHE ALWAYS
PICKS THE WRONG GUY.

11:28.067 --> 11:29.601
PROBABLY, UH,

11:29.601 --> 11:32.334
INSUFFICIENTLY PRAISED
AS A CHILD.

11:32.334 --> 11:34.667
GIVES YOU
ATTACHMENT PROBLEMS.

11:34.667 --> 11:37.334
>> WERE YOU INSUFFICIENTLY
PRAISED AS A CHILD?

11:37.334 --> 11:38.801
>> ME?

11:38.801 --> 11:40.200
NO.

11:40.200 --> 11:42.000
THEY PRAISED ME
ALL THE TIME.

11:42.000 --> 11:44.067
WHICH, UH, BACKFIRED

11:44.067 --> 11:46.334
AND MADE ME THINK
TOO MUCH OF MYSELF.

11:46.334 --> 11:47.734
>> YOU OVER THAT?

11:47.734 --> 11:49.934
>> I'M WORKING ON IT.

11:51.934 --> 11:53.868
>> ANYTHING?

11:53.868 --> 11:56.234
>> UH, CAN'T RULE OUT
HELEN BRAMER

11:56.234 --> 11:57.701
OR THE GUARD.

11:57.701 --> 12:00.000
BUT NOTHING BIG
OFF EITHER.

12:00.000 --> 12:03.267
>> THE LAB LIFTED TWO
PARTIAL PRINTS OFF THE VAN.

12:03.267 --> 12:04.601
NO HITS.

12:04.601 --> 12:06.534
BUT THEY DID PUT A VIN NUMBER
TOGETHER.

12:06.534 --> 12:09.100
THAT VAN WAS REPORTED STOLEN
SIX MONTHS AGO

12:09.100 --> 12:13.100
BY A FRANK STROUP.

12:13.100 --> 12:15.100
>> WELL, TRUTH BE TOLD,
I WASN'T UNHAPPY

12:15.100 --> 12:17.100
THAT PIECE OF CRAP
GOT RIPPED OFF.

12:17.100 --> 12:20.701
NEW RIG,
MY BUSINESS REALLY EXPANDS.

12:20.701 --> 12:22.968
>> "MAN WITH A VAN"
TYPE BUSINESS?

12:22.968 --> 12:24.601
>> THIS IS MORE
THAN JUST A VAN.

12:24.601 --> 12:27.234
PAYLOAD OVER 3,000 POUNDS.

12:27.234 --> 12:29.701
CAPACITY, 275 CUBIC FEET.

12:31.834 --> 12:34.567
LOSING THE OLD RIG
WAS THE BEST NEWS I EVER GOT.

12:34.567 --> 12:36.434
>> WELL, FRANK,
WE GOT MORE NEWS FOR YOU.

12:36.434 --> 12:37.934
YOUR OLD VAN...

12:37.934 --> 12:39.100
WE FOUND IT.

12:39.100 --> 12:41.334
>> NO.

12:41.334 --> 12:42.334
I JUST WENT THROUGH

12:42.334 --> 12:44.734
THE WHOLE INSURANCE CLAIM
PROCESS.

12:44.734 --> 12:46.400
IT TOOK ME, LIKE,
THREE MONTHS.

12:46.400 --> 12:47.834
ARE THEY GONNA GET--
>> NO, FRANK.

12:47.834 --> 12:49.033
IT'S OKAY.

12:49.033 --> 12:50.601
NOBODY'S GONNA
MAKE YOU TAKE IT BACK.

12:50.601 --> 12:53.734
IT'S, UH, IT'S KIND OF
OUT OF COMMISSION, ANYWAY.

12:53.734 --> 12:55.901
>> WHERE WERE YOU
IN EARLY JUNE?

12:55.901 --> 12:57.367
>> EARLY JUNE?

12:57.367 --> 12:59.267
SAME PLACE I GO
EVERY YEAR.

12:59.267 --> 13:00.601
FLORIDA.

13:00.601 --> 13:01.701
FISHING LARGEMOUTH BASS.

13:01.701 --> 13:03.434
BEEN GOING
SINCE I WAS A KID.

13:03.434 --> 13:05.100
>> HEY, ALL THIS DETAILING.

13:05.100 --> 13:07.033
IS THIS, UH,
THAT'S YOU, ISN'T IT?

13:10.501 --> 13:12.100
>> WITH MY DAD.

13:12.100 --> 13:13.467
I KNOW THIS GUY.

13:13.467 --> 13:14.834
YOU GIVE HIM A PHOTO,

13:14.834 --> 13:17.167
HE CAN PUT IT ANYWHERE.

13:17.167 --> 13:19.934
VERY REASONABLE,
IF YOU'RE INTERESTED.

13:19.934 --> 13:22.834
>> WOW, LOOK, IT FILLS
THE WHOLE SIDE OF THE VAN.

13:24.767 --> 13:27.300
>> WELL, YOU KNOW.
IT'S MY DAD.

13:27.300 --> 13:30.000
WHO DOESN'T LOVE THEIR DAD?

13:30.000 --> 13:32.667
>> AND, JUST SO I UNDERSTAND,

13:32.667 --> 13:34.300
YOUR OLD VAN GOT STOLEN

13:34.300 --> 13:36.067
WHEN YOU WERE AWAY
FISHING IN FLORIDA?

13:36.067 --> 13:37.300
>> YEAH, IT WAS IN THERE.

13:37.300 --> 13:40.934
UH, CAME HOME, AND THE LOCKS
WERE BUSTED OFF.

13:40.934 --> 13:42.634
>> ANYONE KNOW
YOU WERE GONE?

13:42.634 --> 13:44.667
>> UH...I MEAN,

13:44.667 --> 13:47.534
IT'S NOT LIKE I MAKE
ANY SECRETS OF MY MOVEMENTS.

13:47.534 --> 13:49.334
COULD YOU NOT LEAN
ON THE VAN?

13:49.334 --> 13:50.634
>> ON THE VAN?
OH, SORRY.

13:50.634 --> 13:53.100
SORRY.

13:55.334 --> 13:57.267
[indistinct chatter]

14:00.033 --> 14:01.334
>> 'SCUSE ME.
THANK YOU.

14:01.334 --> 14:02.868
UH, AHEM.

14:02.868 --> 14:04.601
THEY TOLD ME
YOU WERE DOWN HERE.

14:04.601 --> 14:07.100
>> UM, YEAH, I LIKE
TO WATCH THESE GUYS.

14:07.100 --> 14:10.133
>> AH, ANOTHER ONE OF THOSE
EMPTY-YOUR-MIND THINGS?

14:10.133 --> 14:12.534
>> YEAH, A REPORT
CAME UP ON FRANK STROUP.

14:12.534 --> 14:14.634
UH, HE WAS TELLING THE TRUTH,
AS IT TURNS OUT.

14:14.634 --> 14:16.734
HE FLEW DOWN TO FLORIDA
ON THE LAST DAY OF MAY.

14:16.734 --> 14:18.167
CHECKED INTO
THE PINK FLAMINGO

14:18.167 --> 14:21.167
GOLF AND GAME FISHING RESORT
IN CLEARWATER FOR TWO WEEKS,

14:21.167 --> 14:23.701
RENTED A BOAT, AND RAN UP
A $1,000 BAR TAB.

14:23.701 --> 14:27.067
>> CAN YOU DRINK THAT MUCH
AND STILL GO FISHING?

14:27.067 --> 14:28.167
I ASSUME WE CHECKED
CREDIT CARDS?

14:28.167 --> 14:29.167
>> CREDIT CARDS
AND AIRLINE MANIFESTS.

14:29.167 --> 14:30.367
YEAH, IT ALL CHECKED OUT.

14:30.367 --> 14:32.167
>> DON'T START FINISHING
MY SENTENCES TOO.

14:32.167 --> 14:35.534
UH, WE GOT A HIT
ON THOSE PRINTS FROM THE VAN.

14:35.534 --> 14:37.000
THEY MATCHED
A JOE GALLAGHER.

14:37.000 --> 14:39.400
HE WAS PRINTED WHEN HE APPLIED
TO BE A SUBSTITUTE TEACHER.

14:39.400 --> 14:40.901
CURRENT ADDRESS?

14:40.901 --> 14:42.834
>> WELL, ACCORDING TO THE NEW
BURIAL RULES AT ST. MARY'S,

14:42.834 --> 14:45.100
I'D GUESS HE'S ABOUT
NINE FEET UNDER THE GRASS.

14:47.534 --> 14:49.567
>> THEY FOUND HIS PRINTS
IN THE VAN, BUT HE'S DEAD?

14:49.567 --> 14:52.400
>> HE DIED IN A FIRE
IN JUNE.

14:52.400 --> 14:54.133
JUNE 4TH, TO BE EXACT.

15:00.067 --> 15:01.267
>> SO JOE GALLAGHER

15:01.267 --> 15:03.567
DIES IN A FIRE
IN HIS APARTMENT JUNE 4TH,

15:03.567 --> 15:06.400
TWO DAYS AFTER
THE ARMORED CAR HIT.

15:06.400 --> 15:07.934
SUSPECT ONE, ALEX CARLISLE.

15:07.934 --> 15:11.868
SUSPECT TWO, JOE GALLAGHER.

15:11.868 --> 15:14.400
>> AND THEN THE THIRD MAN
GETS RID OF JOE GALLAGHER.

15:14.400 --> 15:17.534
SIX MONTHS LATER,
HE GETS RID OF ALEX CARLISLE.

15:17.534 --> 15:21.067
>> BUT THE MONEY'S
STILL TOO HOT TO SPEND.

15:21.067 --> 15:23.634
HE'S PLAYING THE LONG GAME,
BURYING ALL HIS LEADS.

15:23.634 --> 15:24.634
>> LET'S UNBURY ONE OF THEM.

15:24.634 --> 15:25.767
WE'RE GONNA NEED
A COURT ORDER

15:25.767 --> 15:28.400
TO DISINTER
JOE GALLAGHER'S BODY.

15:28.400 --> 15:31.200
>> HE WAS D.O.A., OBVIOUSLY.

15:31.200 --> 15:32.901
BUT THERE ARE SIGNS
RIGOR SET IN

15:32.901 --> 15:34.801
BEFORE THE FLAMES
GOT TO HIM.

15:34.801 --> 15:36.267
>> THE ORIGINAL
M.E.'S REPORT

15:36.267 --> 15:37.934
SAID HE DIED
OF SMOKE INHALATION.

15:37.934 --> 15:40.567
>> UH, YOU'D HAVE RESIDUE
IN HIS RIB CAGE

15:40.567 --> 15:41.767
IF HE WAS STILL BREATHING.

15:41.767 --> 15:43.767
THERE ISN'T ANY.
>> CAUSE OF DEATH?

15:43.767 --> 15:45.901
>> UH, THERE'S NO SIGN
OF TRAUMA.

15:45.901 --> 15:46.934
IT'S HARD TO TELL.

15:46.934 --> 15:48.200
MAYBE SUFFOCATION?

15:48.200 --> 15:50.167
>> SO MAYBE HE SMOTHERED
IN THE BED.

15:50.167 --> 15:52.234
>> WHICH WOULD EXPLAIN
THE ORIGINAL M.E.'S REPORT.

15:52.234 --> 15:55.968
>> AND THE FIRE WAS SET
TO COVER THE MURDER.

15:55.968 --> 15:59.467
NOT THE FINAL CHAPTER
JOE GALLAGHER WAS LOOKING FOR.

15:59.467 --> 16:02.601
>> OH, THAT CHAPTER
HASN'T BEEN WRITTEN.

16:04.968 --> 16:06.000
>> THIS ISN'T JOE GALLAGHER.

16:08.033 --> 16:10.400
>> RICHARD GREENWOOD,
IRAQ VETERAN.

16:12.200 --> 16:13.934
V.A. FILES
WITH DENTAL RECORDS.

16:13.934 --> 16:15.367
HE WAS IN AND OUT
OF SHELTERS,

16:15.367 --> 16:17.100
WHEN HE WASN'T
LIVING ON THE STREET.

16:17.100 --> 16:18.601
ADJUSTMENT PROBLEMS
WHEN HE GOT BACK.

16:18.601 --> 16:20.434
DRINKING, DRUGS.

16:20.434 --> 16:22.767
>> JOE GALLAGHER
WANTS TO DISAPPEAR.

16:22.767 --> 16:25.434
WHAT BETTER WAY
THAN FAKING YOUR OWN DEATH?

16:32.701 --> 16:33.767
>> THIS IS IT.

16:33.767 --> 16:35.667
JOE GALLAGHER'S
RENTAL APPLICATION

16:35.667 --> 16:37.467
SAID HE WORKED HERE.

16:37.467 --> 16:39.667
>> WELL, I WORKED HERE,

16:39.667 --> 16:42.300
I'D BE THINKING ABOUT
HITTING AN ARMORED CAR TOO.

16:42.300 --> 16:43.467
>> YEAH.

16:43.467 --> 16:45.634
>> YEAH, SURE.
JOE GALLAGHER.

16:45.634 --> 16:47.467
>> YOU KNOW HIM?
>> KNEW.

16:47.467 --> 16:49.434
HE GOT BURNED UP
IN A FIRE.

16:49.434 --> 16:52.033
HE LIKED THE LADIES,
I CAN TELL YOU THAT MUCH.

16:52.033 --> 16:53.367
HE NEVER LEFT HERE ALONE.

16:53.367 --> 16:55.868
>> DID YOU TWO EVER DATE?

16:55.868 --> 16:56.868
>> [chuckles]

16:56.868 --> 16:58.634
YOU COULD CALL IT THAT.

16:58.634 --> 17:01.634
HE CAME OVER TO MY PLACE
A COUPLE TIMES AFTER WORK.

17:01.634 --> 17:04.000
HE WASN'T MUCH GOOD,
YOU KNOW...IN THE SACK.

17:05.901 --> 17:09.334
AS FAR AS EYE CANDY GOES,
HE WAS PRETTY SWEET.

17:09.334 --> 17:11.634
HE LIKED HEARING
ABOUT HIS LOOKS.

17:11.634 --> 17:14.767
HE WOULDN'T MIND IF YOU
TOLD HIM A COUPLE TIMES A DAY.

17:14.767 --> 17:17.166
>> WELL, THANK YOU
FOR YOUR HELP.

17:21.701 --> 17:23.099
THAT WAS A BUST.

17:23.099 --> 17:24.367
>> UH, THE WAY SHE TALKED,

17:24.367 --> 17:25.901
JOE GALLAGHER
DOESN'T JUST LIKE WOMEN,

17:25.901 --> 17:27.400
HE NEEDS TO IMPRESS THEM.

17:27.400 --> 17:28.567
>> MEANING...

17:28.567 --> 17:30.100
>> PROBABLY NEEDS
TO IMPRESS EVERYBODY.

17:30.100 --> 17:31.434
AN EASY MARK.

17:31.434 --> 17:32.968
WHOEVER OUR THIRD MAN IS,

17:32.968 --> 17:35.367
HE KNEW WHO TO RECRUIT.

17:35.367 --> 17:38.133
>> I'M ALIVE.
SURPRISED?

17:40.367 --> 17:42.434
NO, IT WASN'T ME
DIED IN THAT FIRE.

17:42.434 --> 17:43.801
YOU KNOW WHY.

17:43.801 --> 17:46.567
I FIGURED YOU'D GET ME
FIRST CHANCE YOU HAD.

17:46.567 --> 17:48.000
NO, I AIN'T TELLING YOU
WHERE I AM.

17:48.000 --> 17:51.367
I'M COMING TO YOU.
I WANT MY SHARE.

17:51.367 --> 17:53.501
I KNOW WHAT HAPPENED
TO ALEX.

17:53.501 --> 17:55.434
I'M TAKING MEASURES.

17:55.434 --> 17:57.667
NO, YOU LISTEN.

17:57.667 --> 17:59.434
ONE OTHER THING.

17:59.434 --> 18:01.667
YOU RUN,
I TALK TO THE COPS

18:01.667 --> 18:04.501
BEFORE YOU CLEAR JERSEY.

18:04.501 --> 18:06.467
[beeps]

18:08.868 --> 18:10.234
[beeping]

18:10.234 --> 18:13.300
[sniffles]

18:13.300 --> 18:14.501
[phone ringing]

18:14.501 --> 18:17.033
>> DON'T ANSWER IT, KEVIN!

18:17.033 --> 18:18.234
IT'S PROBABLY
A WRONG NUMBER.

18:18.234 --> 18:20.334
IT'LL STOP RINGING
IN A MINUTE.

18:20.334 --> 18:22.767
COME ON, LET'S FINISH
YOUR HOMEWORK, OKAY?

18:35.701 --> 18:37.133
>> SO GALLAGHER
LURES THE VET HOME,

18:37.133 --> 18:38.968
KILLS HIM, SETS THE FIRE,

18:38.968 --> 18:40.434
AND WE ASSUME WHAT?

18:40.434 --> 18:42.868
GALLAGHER AND THE THIRD MAN
SPLIT THE MONEY?

18:42.868 --> 18:46.067
>> STILL NOT ONE DOLLAR
OF WHICH HAS TURNED UP.

18:46.067 --> 18:47.534
>> I PUT THE STORY
OUT TO THE PRESS.

18:47.534 --> 18:49.167
PAPER COMES OUT
IN THREE HOURS.

18:49.167 --> 18:50.567
LET'S SEE IF WE
FLUSH SOMEONE OUT.

18:50.567 --> 18:53.400
>> GALLAGHER AND THE OTHER GUY
COULD RUN.

18:53.400 --> 18:54.667
[phone ringing]
>> ALEX CARLISLE DIDN'T RUN.

18:54.667 --> 18:56.968
I'M BETTING
THEY'RE ALL LOCAL.

18:56.968 --> 18:59.000
>> NICHOLS.

18:59.000 --> 19:00.934
WHAT HAPPENED?

19:00.934 --> 19:03.200
YEAH, SURE.
WE'LL BE RIGHT THERE.

19:07.934 --> 19:09.033
>> YOU GONNA SHARE?

19:09.033 --> 19:11.133
>> UM, THAT WAS
ABOUT FRANK STROUP,

19:11.133 --> 19:12.634
THE GUY WHOSE VAN
WAS STOLEN FOR THE ROBBERY.

19:15.400 --> 19:17.567
HE'S BEEN SHOT.

19:17.567 --> 19:19.067
>> I'M WORKING OUT BACK

19:19.067 --> 19:22.767
AND THIS GUY JUMPS OUT
FROM THE SIDE OF THE HOUSE.

19:25.167 --> 19:26.901
>> LOOKS LIKE HE MISSED.

19:27.367 --> 19:28.734
>> LUCKY FOR ME.

19:28.734 --> 19:31.267
OTHERWISE, I'M IN THE MORGUE
INSTEAD OF THE HOSPITAL.

19:31.267 --> 19:32.701
>> WE STILL
WOULD HAVE VISITED.

19:32.701 --> 19:37.133
>> THANKS.
YOUR PARTNER'S A COMEDIAN.

19:37.133 --> 19:40.434
>> WITNESSES SAID THEY HEARD
MORE THAN ONE SHOT.

19:40.434 --> 19:43.033
>> I TOOK THE GUN
OFF THE GUY

19:43.033 --> 19:44.934
AND THEN I TOOK
A COUPLE OF SHOTS AT HIM.

19:44.934 --> 19:46.834
>> JUST FIRED A COUPLE OF--

19:46.834 --> 19:48.767
COUPLE OF RANDOM SHOTS?

19:48.767 --> 19:51.133
>> THE GUY
TRIES TO KILL ME.

19:51.133 --> 19:53.200
I TRIED TO KILL HIM BACK.

19:53.200 --> 19:54.434
YOU HEARD OF SELF-DEFENSE?

19:57.400 --> 19:58.601
>> YOU GOT A DESCRIPTION?

19:58.601 --> 19:59.667
>> YEAH.

19:59.667 --> 20:02.133
SKINNY, NOT REAL TALL.

20:02.133 --> 20:03.934
COULD HAVE BEEN A KID.

20:03.934 --> 20:07.601
UH, JEAN JACKET,
YANKEE CAP.

20:07.601 --> 20:09.434
>> BLACK? WHITE?

20:09.434 --> 20:13.601
>> AH, HE WAS WEARING
ONE OF THOSE STOCKING MASKS.

20:13.601 --> 20:16.234
>> ANY IDEA WHY SOMEONE
MIGHT WANT TO SHOOT YOU?

20:16.234 --> 20:18.534
>> WHO KNOWS?

20:18.534 --> 20:20.634
I MEAN, I GOT ENEMIES.

20:20.634 --> 20:21.767
WHO DOESN'T?

20:21.767 --> 20:23.634
BUT NOTHING I'M GONNA
GET SHOT OVER.

20:27.300 --> 20:29.667
>> HE WAS IN FLORIDA,
CLEARWATER, FLORIDA.

20:29.667 --> 20:31.000
>> I KNOW.
>> WE HAVE PASSENGER LISTS.

20:31.000 --> 20:32.234
RESORT RECORDS.

20:32.234 --> 20:34.100
>> I'M JUST SAYING
HIS VAN WAS STOLEN.

20:34.100 --> 20:35.334
IT'S USED IN A ROBBERY.

20:35.334 --> 20:36.834
HE GETS SHOT
IN HIS OWN BACKYARD.

20:36.834 --> 20:38.701
IF HE'S NOT INVOLVED
IN THAT ROBBERY,

20:38.701 --> 20:40.501
HE'S HAVING
A SERIOUS RUN OF BAD LUCK.

20:40.501 --> 20:41.667
>> OKAY, HERE WE ARE.

20:41.667 --> 20:44.467
FRANK SAYS THE SHOOTER

20:44.467 --> 20:46.200
COMES AROUND
THE SIDE OF THE GARAGE.

20:46.200 --> 20:47.534
JUMPS HIM HERE.

20:47.534 --> 20:49.133
FRANK...

20:49.133 --> 20:50.501
YOU KNOW,
WRESTLES THE GUN AWAY

20:50.501 --> 20:52.367
AND GETS OFF
A COUPLE OF SHOTS.

20:52.367 --> 20:54.534
>> AND THE SHOOTER
ESCAPES OVER THE BACK FENCE.

20:54.534 --> 20:56.367
>> YEAH, HERE'S WHERE FRANK
WAS SHOOTING AT.

20:56.367 --> 20:57.567
>> TELL ME THIS:

20:57.567 --> 20:59.334
WHY DOESN'T FRANK
HAVE A BETTER IDEA

20:59.334 --> 21:00.667
OF WHO MIGHT
WANT TO KILL HIM?

21:00.667 --> 21:02.868
>> WELL, THAT'S
THE $64,000 QUESTION.

21:02.868 --> 21:04.434
WHICH, GIVEN
THE CURRENT ECONOMY,

21:04.434 --> 21:06.234
IS NOW THE, WHAT,
$10,000 QUESTION?

21:06.234 --> 21:09.334
UH, YOU KNOW, HE COULD
HAVE CHEATED SOMEBODY.

21:09.334 --> 21:10.767
MIGHT HAVE RIPPED
SOMEBODY OFF.

21:10.767 --> 21:12.200
HE WOULDN'T
HAVE TOLD US THAT.

21:12.200 --> 21:15.000
YOU KNOW,
FRANK'S A GRIFTER, HUSTLER.

21:15.000 --> 21:17.868
>> WELL, HE MUST KEEP RECORDS
FOR HIS LEGIT BIZ.

21:17.868 --> 21:19.801
MAYBE WE CAN FIND
SOMETHING THERE.

21:22.534 --> 21:23.868
>> WHOSE IDEA WAS THIS?

21:23.868 --> 21:27.033
>> I THINK FRANK MISSED
THE BOOKKEEPING CHAPTER

21:27.033 --> 21:28.901
IN <i>SMALL BUSINESSES</i>
 <i>FOR DUMMIES.</i>

21:28.901 --> 21:30.767
>> YEAH, HASN'T HE
HEARD OF COMPUTERS?

21:30.767 --> 21:32.467
THIS IS NUTS.

21:32.467 --> 21:34.400
>> TELL ME YOU'VE GOT
A WARRANT FOR THAT.

21:34.400 --> 21:36.901
>> OH, WHY BOTHER?

21:36.901 --> 21:38.434
>> WE GOT
STROUP'S PERMISSION.

21:38.434 --> 21:40.868
>> HEY, LOOK AT THIS.

21:40.868 --> 21:43.100
PICKUP, LIVINGSTONE AVENUE
IN RIVERDALE.

21:43.100 --> 21:45.234
MARCH 20, A SANDRABRAMER.

21:47.434 --> 21:48.501
>> BRAMER.

21:51.901 --> 21:54.133
AS IN HELEN BRAMER?

21:58.701 --> 22:00.868
[bell rings]

22:00.868 --> 22:02.067
[indistinct chatter]

22:06.634 --> 22:09.267
>> HEY, BUDDY!

22:09.267 --> 22:11.968
HOW WAS YOUR DAY?

22:30.334 --> 22:32.667
>> FRANK STROUP.

22:32.667 --> 22:34.767
HE'S A MOVING GUY.

22:34.767 --> 22:37.501
I HIRED HIM TO HELP ME
MOVE MY MOTHER'S THINGS

22:37.501 --> 22:38.634
AFTER SHE DIED.

22:38.634 --> 22:40.200
>> YOU STAY IN TOUCH
AFTER THE MOVE?

22:40.200 --> 22:42.000
>> WHY WOULD I?

22:42.000 --> 22:44.267
>> BECAUSE THE VAN
STROUP DROVE

22:44.267 --> 22:46.968
WAS USED IN THE DBC
ARMORED ROBBERY.

22:46.968 --> 22:48.767
YOU SAY ANYTHING
TO HIM AT ALL?

22:48.767 --> 22:51.067
>> ABOUT WORK? NO.

22:51.067 --> 22:53.267
WAIT, I...

22:53.267 --> 22:55.601
HE PICKED ME UP
AT THE OFFICE

22:55.601 --> 22:59.167
TO GO MY MOM'S PLACE,
SO HE KNEW WHERE I WORKED.

22:59.167 --> 23:00.834
>> DO YOU KNOW THIS FELLA?

23:09.033 --> 23:11.367
HELEN, DO YOU--
DO YOU KNOW HIM?

23:20.367 --> 23:21.834
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

23:30.000 --> 23:31.400
IF I STAY IN THERE,

23:31.400 --> 23:33.334
HELEN'S GONNA CLAM UP
LIKE A PISTACHIO.

23:33.334 --> 23:35.334
>> [sighs]

23:35.334 --> 23:39.701
FRANK PICKED ME UP
TO GO TO MY MOM'S PLACE.

23:39.701 --> 23:41.868
AND...

23:41.868 --> 23:44.534
HE ASKED ME OUT
FOR A DRINK.

23:44.534 --> 23:47.567
AND, WELL, I WASN'T--

23:47.567 --> 23:49.133
HE'S NOT REALLY MY TYPE.

23:49.133 --> 23:52.200
THEN A COUPLE OF DAYS LATER,
HE CALLED,

23:52.200 --> 23:55.601
SAID HE KNEW SOMEONE
I MIGHT LIKE.

23:55.601 --> 23:57.234
>> JOE GALLAGHER?

23:57.234 --> 23:58.367
>> THE PLACE
WHERE JOE WORKED

23:58.367 --> 23:59.868
WAS ON MY WAY HOME
FROM WORK,

23:59.868 --> 24:01.167
SO I WENT.

24:01.167 --> 24:05.167
JOE WAS THERE
POURING DRINKS.

24:05.167 --> 24:07.067
HE WAS CUTE.

24:07.067 --> 24:10.300
>> SO WHAT HAPPENED
WITH JOE, HELEN?

24:10.300 --> 24:12.868
>> WE DATED A FEW WEEKS.

24:12.868 --> 24:15.400
ALL OF A SUDDEN,
HE DISAPPEARED,

24:15.400 --> 24:17.767
LIKE IT DIDN'T EVEN
MATTER TO HIM.

24:20.434 --> 24:22.901
>> DID YOU TELL JOE ANYTHING

24:22.901 --> 24:24.601
ABOUT THE DBC
ARMORED CAR ROUTE?

24:24.601 --> 24:26.767
>> NO.

24:26.767 --> 24:29.467
BUT...I...

24:29.467 --> 24:32.968
DID SEE HIM ON MY COMPUTER
ONE TIME.

24:34.501 --> 24:39.100
I HAD NO IDEA
WHAT HE WAS DOING.

24:39.100 --> 24:40.767
>> THEN WHY BRING IT UP?

24:42.567 --> 24:45.067
WHAT DID YOU THINK
HE WAS DOING?

24:45.067 --> 24:48.801
>> MY PARTNER IS--WHAT'S
GOING ON WITH HER TODAY?

24:48.801 --> 24:50.567
>> YOU KNEW EXACTLY
WHAT JOE WAS DOING.

24:50.567 --> 24:53.133
HE WAS LOOKING UP
THE ARMORED CAR INFORMATION

24:53.133 --> 24:55.267
WHEN YOU CAUGHT HIM,
AND YOU SAID NOTHING.

24:59.267 --> 25:02.367
>> I WANTED HIM TO STAY.

25:02.367 --> 25:03.801
I WOULD HAVE DONE ANYTHING.

25:03.801 --> 25:05.868
>> INCLUDING
LYING TO THE DETECTIVES

25:05.868 --> 25:08.267
WHO WERE INVESTIGATING
THE ARMORED CAR ROBBERY.

25:08.267 --> 25:10.234
>> SO INTERESTING.

25:10.234 --> 25:12.534
>> WHAT DID YOU SEE
IN JOE, HUH?

25:12.534 --> 25:15.601
TELL ME, WHAT DID YOU
SEE IN THIS GUY, HUH?

25:15.601 --> 25:18.067
HOW DID YOU GET TAKEN IN?

25:20.067 --> 25:22.467
HE USED YOU.
HE TOOK ADVANTAGE OF YOU.

25:22.467 --> 25:25.567
>> HE WANTED TO BE A FAMILY!
HE SAID...

25:25.567 --> 25:28.367
HE WANTED TO BE A FAMILY
WITH ME AND KEVIN.

25:31.234 --> 25:34.634
I SHOULD HAVE
SAID SOMETHING.

25:34.634 --> 25:36.234
I THOUGHT HE WOULD
BE A GOOD FATHER

25:36.234 --> 25:39.434
BECAUSE HE WAS
SUCH A GOOD SON.

25:39.434 --> 25:41.400
>> A GOOD SON?

25:43.234 --> 25:44.567
>> HE WAS A PERFECT SON.

25:44.567 --> 25:47.267
HE DID EVERYTHING
TO GET HIS MOTHER'S APPROVAL.

25:47.267 --> 25:50.267
CALLED HER EVERY SUNDAY,
WITHOUT FAIL.

26:01.801 --> 26:04.701
>> JOE'S DEATH MUST HAVE BEEN
A TERRIBLE SHOCK TO YOU,

26:04.701 --> 26:06.234
MRS. GALLAGHER.

26:06.234 --> 26:08.334
>> [Irish accent]
YES, HE WAS MY ONLY SON.

26:08.334 --> 26:09.834
>> MRS. GALLAGHER,
WAS YOUR SON'S BODY

26:09.834 --> 26:12.534
EVERY POSITIVELY IDENTIFIED
AFTER THE FIRE?

26:12.534 --> 26:13.968
>> NO, THE FIRE DEPARTMENT

26:13.968 --> 26:16.133
SAID HE WAS BURNED
BEYOND RECOGNITION.

26:16.133 --> 26:18.667
>> WHEN DID YOU LAST
HEAR FROM HIM?

26:18.667 --> 26:20.501
>> A FEW WEEKS
BEFORE THE FIRE.

26:20.501 --> 26:23.667
>> SO...SIX,
SEVEN MONTHS AGO?

26:23.667 --> 26:24.667
>> YES.

26:24.667 --> 26:26.467
>> WE HAVE PHONE RECORDS
INDICATING

26:26.467 --> 26:27.801
YOU RECEIVE CALLS
EVERY WEEK

26:27.801 --> 26:30.000
MADE FROM DISPOSABLE PHONES
PURCHASED IN QUEENS.

26:33.667 --> 26:35.234
DO YOU HAVE FAMILY THERE?

26:37.801 --> 26:40.300
>> MY SON TOLD ME
HE WAS IN TROUBLE,

26:40.300 --> 26:43.133
SO I KEPT QUIET.

26:43.133 --> 26:47.501
>> THE MAN DIES IN A FIRE,
AND YOU KEEP IT TO YOURSELF?

26:47.501 --> 26:49.968
>> I GREW UP IN COUNTY ARMAGH
IN IRELAND

26:49.968 --> 26:52.033
IN THE 1970s.

26:52.033 --> 26:54.567
THERE ARE A LOT WORSE SECRETS
THAN THANKING GOD

26:54.567 --> 26:56.300
YOUR ONLY SON'S
STILL ALIVE.

26:56.300 --> 26:57.634
>> WHERE'S JOE?

26:57.634 --> 27:02.167
>> I DON'T KNOW.
HE DOESN'T TELL ME.

27:02.167 --> 27:04.400
>> MAY I, UH...
DO YOU MIND?

27:04.400 --> 27:07.200
"MOM, HAPPY BIRTHDAY.
LOVE, JOE."

27:07.200 --> 27:09.300
OHH.

27:09.300 --> 27:11.334
THAT IS SUCH A NICE GIFT.
WHEN WAS YOUR BIRTHDAY?

27:11.334 --> 27:13.234
>> THREE WEEKS AGO.

27:13.234 --> 27:15.601
BUT THAT
WAS FROM LAST YEAR.

27:25.667 --> 27:27.868
>> JOE DIDN'T BRING
THAT PIECE OF JUNK

27:27.868 --> 27:28.968
UP HERE HIMSELF.

27:28.968 --> 27:30.200
>> NO, AND IT WAS BRAND-NEW.

27:30.200 --> 27:32.267
EVERYTHING ELSE
ON THAT MANTLE IS DUSTY,

27:32.267 --> 27:34.300
EXCEPT FOR JOE'S PRESENT.

27:34.300 --> 27:36.701
>> SO UPS, FED EX, OR DHL?

27:36.701 --> 27:38.400
>> LET'S CHECK
WITH THE LOCAL POST OFFICE.

27:49.901 --> 27:52.000
>> UM...EXCUSE ME.

27:52.000 --> 27:54.434
UH, MY SON KEVIN
DIDN'T COME OUT.

27:54.434 --> 27:55.734
CAN I CHECK INSIDE?

27:58.801 --> 28:00.701
>> HE MUST HAVE LEFT IT
WITH A SUPER, 'CAUSE IT'S ODD

28:00.701 --> 28:02.601
THAT UPS WOULD COME DOWN HERE
FOR A PACKAGE.

28:02.601 --> 28:05.167
>> INFANTILE
CRIMINAL BEHAVIOR.

28:05.167 --> 28:08.133
NO PROBLEMS
KILLING A HOMELESS VET,

28:08.133 --> 28:10.367
BUT NEVER MISS
HIS MOM'S BIRTHDAY.

28:10.367 --> 28:12.667
[door opens,
footsteps]

28:38.868 --> 28:40.200
>> OHH! UHH!

28:42.434 --> 28:44.934
[groaning]

28:47.601 --> 28:50.734
>> EASY, JOE, WE WOULDN'T
WANT YOU TO HURT YOURSELF.

28:50.734 --> 28:52.634
>> ROSS JUST GOT A CALL
FROM HELEN BRAMER.

28:52.634 --> 28:54.234
HER SON KEVIN IS MISSING.

29:03.367 --> 29:06.667
>> OKAY, LET'S DO THIS
THE LONG WAY.

29:06.667 --> 29:08.567
WE FOUND YOUR PRINTS
IN THE VAN.

29:08.567 --> 29:11.334
WE KNOW YOU DID
THE DBC JOB.

29:11.334 --> 29:13.033
WAS ALEX CARLISLE
A FRIEND OF YOURS?

29:13.033 --> 29:14.701
AND WHAT ABOUT FRANK STROUP?

29:14.701 --> 29:16.767
DID HE GIVE YOU HIS VAN?

29:20.501 --> 29:22.667
>> WHAT'S THE MATTER?
THE CAT GOT YOUR TONGUE?

29:22.667 --> 29:24.234
IT'S ALL A BIG GAME

29:24.234 --> 29:25.734
WHEN YOU'RE SCREWING
WITH SOME POOR WOMAN'S LIFE,

29:25.734 --> 29:27.467
BUT IT'S NOT
A GAME ANYMORE.

29:27.467 --> 29:28.901
>> HERE'S WHAT I KNOW:
YOU MET HELEN,

29:28.901 --> 29:30.234
YOU GOT
THE ARMORED CAR ROUTES,

29:30.234 --> 29:31.601
AND THEN
YOU PLANNED THAT JOB.

29:31.601 --> 29:33.868
AND THEN YOU KILLED
THAT VET GREENWOOD.

29:33.868 --> 29:35.701
>> NO, I DIDN'T KILL HIM.

29:35.701 --> 29:37.334
HE WAS ALREADY DEAD.

29:37.334 --> 29:39.634
HE USED TO HANG
AROUND THE BUILDING,

29:39.634 --> 29:41.267
AND THE NIGHT
AFTER THE ROBBERY

29:41.267 --> 29:42.701
I FOUND HIM
BY THE DUMPSTERS.

29:42.701 --> 29:44.634
>> WHY DID YOU SET THE FIRE?

29:44.634 --> 29:47.501
>> 'CAUSE I THOUGHT
THEY'D COME AFTER ME.

29:47.501 --> 29:48.601
>> WELL, YOU WERE SMART.

29:48.601 --> 29:50.200
YOU DIDN'T
TRUST YOUR PARTNERS.

29:50.200 --> 29:51.801
>> I DIDN'T RIG THE VAN,
OKAY?

29:51.801 --> 29:52.901
I DIDN'T RIG THAT VAN.

29:52.901 --> 29:54.801
>> HEY, SIT DOWN.

29:54.801 --> 29:56.501
ONCE YOUR PARTNER
GETS OUT OF THE CITY,

29:56.501 --> 29:57.801
HE'S NOT GONNA
KEEP KEVIN WITH HIM.

29:57.801 --> 29:58.767
YOU GOT THAT?

30:02.467 --> 30:04.000
KID'S GONNA BE DEAD WEIGHT,

30:04.000 --> 30:05.467
AND THEN
HE'S JUST GONNA BE DEAD.

30:09.767 --> 30:11.567
EVERY SECOND THAT GOES BY,
YOU'RE IN DEEPER.

30:11.567 --> 30:13.634
YOU'RE GOING DOWN FOR MURDER
AND ARMED ROBBERY.

30:13.634 --> 30:16.067
YOU WANT TO ADD ACCESSORY
TO CHILD MURDER?

30:16.067 --> 30:18.367
>> HE WOULDN'T KILL A KID.

30:18.367 --> 30:19.901
HE WOULDN'T.

30:24.167 --> 30:27.267
>> WHO'S "HE," JOE?

30:37.501 --> 30:39.734
[door opens]

30:45.434 --> 30:47.767
>> HEY, I SAW YOU LEAVING.
DO YOU MIND?

30:47.767 --> 30:50.067
>> NO, PLEASE.
I'M--I'M GLAD YOU'RE HERE.

30:50.067 --> 30:52.534
>> HE'S NOT GONNA GIVE IT UP.

30:52.534 --> 30:57.033
>> I ALWAYS SEE PEOPLE
INSIDE THESE DOLLS.

30:57.033 --> 30:59.200
LAYERS, EACH PERSONALITY.

30:59.200 --> 31:01.868
THE CHILD INSIDE THE ADULT.

31:01.868 --> 31:03.367
EACH NEED.

31:03.367 --> 31:05.367
EACH DISORDER...

31:05.367 --> 31:06.868
ENCASED IN THE NEXT.

31:09.734 --> 31:11.033
>> WHAT?

31:19.701 --> 31:21.300
>> WHAT DO YOU CALL
A PRIEST?

31:21.300 --> 31:23.133
>> A PRIEST?

31:23.133 --> 31:25.267
>> NO, WHAT DO YOU CALL
 <i>YOUR</i> PRIEST?

31:25.267 --> 31:27.667
>> I CALL HIM FATHER BILL.

31:29.968 --> 31:31.400
>> I SHOULD LISTEN TO YOU.

31:31.400 --> 31:34.634
OHH, ALL THAT DETAILING
ON HIS VAN.

31:34.634 --> 31:36.400
HIS FATHER.

31:36.400 --> 31:38.200
WHO CALLED THE FLORIDA HOTEL
TO GET THE ROOM RECORD

31:38.200 --> 31:39.300
WHERE FRANK STROUP WENT?

31:39.300 --> 31:40.801
>> LOUIS, DOWNSTAIRS.

31:40.801 --> 31:41.934
HE'S A GOOD COP.

31:41.934 --> 31:45.300
>> UH-HUH.

31:45.300 --> 31:46.868
JERSEY DRIVER'S LICENSE.

31:46.868 --> 31:51.601
FRANCIS STROUP, AGE 73.

31:51.601 --> 31:53.534
MEN DON'T LIKE
BEING CALLED FRANCIS.

31:53.534 --> 31:55.801
WANT TO BET HE'S FRANK'S DAD
AND CALLS HIMSELF FRANK.

31:55.801 --> 31:57.267
WHERE'S OUR FRANK?

31:57.267 --> 31:59.934
>> CHECKED OUT
OF ST. VINCENT'S AROUND NOON.

31:59.934 --> 32:02.634
>> YOU WERE RIGHT.

32:02.634 --> 32:04.701
HE'S THE THIRD MAN.

32:04.701 --> 32:07.100
HE USED HIS CREDIT CARD
TO BUY THE PLANE TICKET,

32:07.100 --> 32:09.767
CHARGE THE HOTEL
FOR THE FATHER.

32:09.767 --> 32:13.467
LET'S FAX A PHOTO OF FRANK
THE YOUNGER DOWN TO FLORIDA.

32:13.467 --> 32:15.234
I'M BETTING HE DIDN'T
GO FISHING THIS YEAR.

32:16.834 --> 32:20.267
>> I'LL GET E.S.U.
TO PICK UP FRANK STROUP.

32:20.267 --> 32:24.667
>> FRANK...KNEW THAT JOE
CARED ABOUT THE KID.

32:24.667 --> 32:29.634
HE KNEW
HOW TO KEEP JOE QUIET.

32:29.634 --> 32:32.300
THAT'S WHY FRANK TOOK HIM.

32:34.801 --> 32:37.467
[door opens]

32:37.467 --> 32:39.634
>> FRANK KIDNAPPED THE BOY
BECAUSE OF YOU.

32:39.634 --> 32:40.834
DIDN'T HE?

32:40.834 --> 32:42.467
YOU SHOT HIM.

32:42.467 --> 32:44.467
THEN YOU GRABBED THE MONEY
FROM THAT ARMORED CAR.

32:44.467 --> 32:46.501
DID YOU?

32:46.501 --> 32:49.334
YEAH, YOU DID.

32:49.334 --> 32:51.234
NOW FRANK WANTS IT BACK.

32:51.234 --> 32:52.734
YOU WERE GONNA
GIVE IT TO HIM AS RANSOM,

32:52.734 --> 32:53.734
BUT WE ARRESTED YOU FIRST.

32:53.734 --> 32:54.834
>> NO.

32:54.834 --> 32:56.067
>> WHERE IS HE, JOE?

32:56.067 --> 32:57.801
WHERE WERE YOU SUPPOSED
TO MEET FRANK?

32:59.601 --> 33:01.701
>> I CAN'T TELL YOU.

33:01.701 --> 33:02.968
HE'LL KILL THE BOY.

33:02.968 --> 33:04.734
>> YOU CAN'T SAVE HIM, JOE.

33:04.734 --> 33:05.801
WE CAN.

33:05.801 --> 33:07.534
>> YOU DON'T KNOW FRANK.

33:07.534 --> 33:09.767
I JUST WENT TO TALK TO HIM,
AND HE STARTED SHOOTING.

33:09.767 --> 33:11.267
I SHOT HIM IN SELF-DEFENSE.

33:11.267 --> 33:13.734
>> WHERE ARE THEY, JOE?
>> HE'S CRAZY.

33:13.734 --> 33:17.067
MOVES PEOPLE AROUND
LIKE PAWNS.

33:17.067 --> 33:19.334
YOU GOT TO LET ME GO.

33:19.334 --> 33:22.934
HE'S EXPECTING ME.

33:22.934 --> 33:25.334
>> I CAN'T DO THAT, JOE.

33:30.434 --> 33:32.133
[door opens]

33:37.834 --> 33:39.767
>> WE JUST TALKED
TO THE RESORT IN FLORIDA.

33:39.767 --> 33:41.567
THE FRANK
WHO STAYED THERE IN JUNE

33:41.567 --> 33:44.367
WAS A HAPPY, HARD-DRINKING
MAN IN HIS 70s.

33:44.367 --> 33:46.300
OUR FRANK IS GONE.

33:46.300 --> 33:47.834
I PUT OUT A STATEWIDE.

33:52.267 --> 33:54.901
>> HE KNOWS WHERE HE IS.

33:54.901 --> 33:57.200
AND I THINK I MAY KNOW...

33:57.200 --> 33:59.200
SOMEONE WHO CAN
PERSUADE HIM TO TELL.

34:21.601 --> 34:24.567
>> WHERE'S KEVIN?

34:27.199 --> 34:31.067
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
WHAT YOU DID TO HIM?

34:31.067 --> 34:32.734
A CHILD.

34:32.734 --> 34:35.567
YOU GAVE HIM
WHAT HE WANTED

34:35.567 --> 34:37.132
AND THEN YOU TOOK IT AWAY.

34:37.132 --> 34:41.234
THE ONLY THING HE WANTED.

34:41.234 --> 34:42.701
WHERE IS HE?

34:46.067 --> 34:47.900
WHERE IS HE?

34:50.199 --> 34:53.766
>> FRANK HAS
A CABIN UPSTATE.

34:58.100 --> 35:02.801
[receding footsteps]

35:02.801 --> 35:04.834
[door slams]

35:06.133 --> 35:07.434
>> HE'S INSIDE.

35:07.434 --> 35:09.567
HE WANTS TO DRIVE
HIS VAN OUT CLEAN

35:09.567 --> 35:10.968
WITH AN ESCORT
TO THE CANADIAN BORDER.

35:10.968 --> 35:12.467
HE'LL LET THE KID GO THEN.

35:12.467 --> 35:14.167
>> HE'LL LET THE KID GO NOW.

35:25.934 --> 35:27.934
>> I'M COMING IN!

35:27.934 --> 35:29.534
I DON'T HAVE A GUN.

35:32.767 --> 35:35.601
YOU'RE NOT IN THAT DEEP
RIGHT NOW.

35:35.601 --> 35:37.234
WE KNOW YOU DIDN'T DO IT.

35:45.100 --> 35:47.801
FRANK...

35:47.801 --> 35:49.467
THIS IS ME COMING IN.

35:51.701 --> 35:53.334
FRANK, LET HIM GO, FRANK.

35:53.334 --> 35:55.000
>> IT WAS ALL JOE'S IDEA.

35:55.000 --> 35:56.734
GETTING THE ROUTES
FROM THAT CHICK,

35:56.734 --> 35:58.801
THE FIRE IN HIS APARTMENT--
ALL JOE.

35:58.801 --> 35:59.868
>> WE GET IT.

35:59.868 --> 36:01.601
HE CONVINCED YOU,
THEN HE SHOT YOU.

36:01.601 --> 36:03.200
HE'S A DOUBLE-CROSSING
SON OF A BITCH.

36:03.200 --> 36:04.234
LET KEVIN GO.

36:07.234 --> 36:08.901
>> I WAS AFRAID
HE WOULD KILL ME.

36:08.901 --> 36:11.367
I WAS ONLY TRYING
TO PROTECT MYSELF.

36:11.367 --> 36:12.834
I WOULD NEVER HURT THE BOY.

36:12.834 --> 36:14.167
>> OF COURSE YOU WOULDN'T
HURT THE BOY, FRANK.

36:14.167 --> 36:15.801
THAT'S NOT WHO YOU ARE.
LET HIM COME WITH ME.

36:19.634 --> 36:20.801
>> NO.

36:20.801 --> 36:22.534
I GIVE HIM UP,
I GOT NOTHING.

36:22.534 --> 36:23.834
>> YOU'LL HAVE ME, FRANK.
HELP US OUT.

36:23.834 --> 36:25.434
LET THE KID GO.

36:35.067 --> 36:36.467
COME ON.

36:36.467 --> 36:37.501
COME ON.

36:37.501 --> 36:39.367
FRANK, THAT'S NOT
WHO YOU ARE.

36:39.367 --> 36:40.534
LET HIM COME WITH ME.

36:48.267 --> 36:50.868
>> YOU'RE STAYING!

36:50.868 --> 36:52.167
>> THAT'S RIGHT, WE'RE OKAY.
I'M STAYING.

36:52.167 --> 36:54.567
GO AHEAD, KEVIN.
>> HURRY UP!

36:54.567 --> 36:56.000
COME ON!

37:03.501 --> 37:06.300
JUST SO WE'RE CLEAR,
JOE IS BEHIND ALL OF THIS.

37:06.300 --> 37:07.367
>> WE KNOW, FRANK.

37:07.367 --> 37:08.601
JOE LOOKS
FOR DESPERATE PEOPLE,

37:08.601 --> 37:09.667
AND HE USES THEM.

37:09.667 --> 37:11.367
AND WHEN HE NEEDS TO,
HE KILLS THEM.

37:16.300 --> 37:18.701
>> I WAS SCARED, MAN.
HE SCARED ME.

37:18.701 --> 37:20.467
>> YOU NEEDED THE MONEY
FOR YOUR BUSINESS, RIGHT?

37:20.467 --> 37:23.067
>> YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT.
I NEEDED THE MONEY.

37:23.067 --> 37:25.901
I CAN HELP YOU.
I CAN TELL YOU EVERYTHING.

37:25.901 --> 37:28.734
>> GREAT, THAT'S PERFECT.

37:30.567 --> 37:32.467
>> I WAS A MAN WITH A VAN.

37:32.467 --> 37:34.767
WHAT THE HELL
IS A MAN WITH A VAN?

37:34.767 --> 37:37.334
HE PROMISED ME
MY OWN MOVING COMPANY!

37:40.534 --> 37:42.133
>> HE MANIPULATED YOU.

37:42.133 --> 37:43.934
YOU CAN HELP US.
AND WE CAN HELP YOU.

37:53.634 --> 37:54.667
[cocks gun]

37:54.667 --> 37:55.767
>> FRANK...

37:55.767 --> 37:57.167
FRANK.
YOU DON'T WANT TO DO THAT.

38:02.200 --> 38:05.033
LET JOE GO DOWN FOR THIS,
NOT YOU.

38:22.133 --> 38:23.968
THAT'S RIGHT.

38:23.968 --> 38:25.434
THAT'S RIGHT.

38:29.000 --> 38:31.434
[gun clicks]

38:31.434 --> 38:33.734
LET'S GO.

38:33.734 --> 38:35.334
COME ON.

38:39.334 --> 38:41.601
LET'S GO.
COME ON.

38:41.601 --> 38:42.734
THERE WE GO.

38:45.300 --> 38:47.133
>> [grunting]
[siren approaching]

38:47.133 --> 38:49.067
>> FRANK STROUP, YOU'RE
UNDER ARREST FOR KIDNAPPING,

38:49.067 --> 38:50.534
ARMED ROBBERY, AND MURDER.

38:50.534 --> 38:53.334
YOU HAVE THE RIGHT
TO REMAIN SILENT.

38:53.334 --> 38:55.267
>> WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

38:55.267 --> 38:57.667
I'M GONNA HELP YOU GUYS.

38:57.667 --> 38:59.234
WHAT ABOUT JOE GALLAGHER?

38:59.234 --> 39:00.834
>> I LIED.

39:00.834 --> 39:03.868
OR YOU COULD CALL IT,
UH, MANIPULATION.

39:03.868 --> 39:07.200
THE TROUBLE WITH BEING
A MALIGNANT NARCISSIST, FRANK,

39:07.200 --> 39:10.000
YOU FORGET OTHER PEOPLE
MANIPULATE TOO.

39:10.000 --> 39:13.133
I WASN'T TALKING ABOUT JOE
USING PEOPLE.

39:13.133 --> 39:15.701
I WAS TALKING ABOUT YOU.

39:26.100 --> 39:27.634
THAT'S GOOD.
LOOK AT THAT.

39:27.634 --> 39:29.367
YOU LIKE THAT?
OH, LOOK WHO'S HERE.

39:30.968 --> 39:32.367
>> MOM.

39:32.367 --> 39:33.467
>> OH!

39:42.868 --> 39:45.868
I AM SO GRATEFUL.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

39:45.868 --> 39:48.400
>> WE'RE GLAD EVERYTHING
WORKED OUT WITH KEVIN.

39:48.400 --> 39:51.367
THE D.A. IS NOT GONNA
PRESS CHARGES.

39:51.367 --> 39:52.801
HOPE EVERYTHING
WORKS OUT.

39:52.801 --> 39:56.601
>> YEAH, I THINK WE'RE
PROBABLY GONNA HEAD TO MAINE.

39:56.601 --> 39:59.200
BE NEAR FAMILY.

39:59.200 --> 40:01.534
I'VE GOT TO STOP LOOKING
FOR SOMETHING HERE

40:01.534 --> 40:03.200
I'M NEVER GONNA FIND.

40:09.601 --> 40:10.868
>> GOOD LUCK TO YOU BOTH.

40:10.868 --> 40:12.200
>> SAME TO YOU.

40:12.200 --> 40:13.467
>> BYE.

40:15.801 --> 40:19.467
>> SO HOW DID YOU
FINALLY GET TO FRANK?

40:19.467 --> 40:21.934
>> PRIEST, FATHER,
RUSSIAN DOLLS.

40:21.934 --> 40:25.834
AND YOU
IN FRANK'S BACKYARD.

40:25.834 --> 40:27.267
YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY.

40:27.267 --> 40:29.167
THE MIND IS
A RELEVANCE-MAKING MACHINE.

40:29.167 --> 40:31.200
>> IT'S A GOOD THING
YOUR MIND WORKS THAT WAY.

40:31.200 --> 40:34.033
>> YOURS TOO.
