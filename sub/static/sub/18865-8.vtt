00:06.974 --> 00:08.874
- Well, where are you off to?

00:08.909 --> 00:10.876
- To pick up the motel coasters.

00:10.911 --> 00:12.945
- Oh, you were serious.

00:12.980 --> 00:14.713
- Yeah, custom coasters

00:14.748 --> 00:16.215
are a very effective
marketing tool.

00:16.250 --> 00:17.716
- Says who?!

00:17.751 --> 00:19.685
The guy who invented custom
beer cozies?

00:19.720 --> 00:21.120
- Coasters work.

00:21.155 --> 00:22.688
- Yes, the last thing
we want to do

00:22.723 --> 00:24.757
is stain these exquisite
table tops.

00:24.792 --> 00:26.525
- Moira, you're having a drink,

00:26.560 --> 00:28.027
you glance down at your coaster,

00:28.062 --> 00:30.162
it says, "tweet us on Facebook!"

00:30.197 --> 00:31.864
Or uh, "leave us a review!"

00:31.899 --> 00:33.699

00:33.734 --> 00:35.601
okay, I think I will.

00:35.636 --> 00:37.836
- Is that what it says?

an online presence.

If they're at the motel
using the coasters,

01:03.764 --> 01:06.632
they don't need to know
where the motel is.

01:08.168 --> 01:11.370
- Um, I was referring
to a web address.

01:11.405 --> 01:13.539
Or a Twitter handle.

01:13.574 --> 01:15.107

you'd wanna put on there.

this down.

05:21.421 --> 05:23.155
A brief description
of the business.

05:23.190 --> 05:24.489
- Um well, it's- um,

05:24.524 --> 05:26.258
it's a General Store,

05:26.293 --> 05:28.126
but it's also a very
specific store.

05:28.161 --> 05:29.561
- Huh.

05:29.596 --> 05:31.964
- And it's also
not just a store,

05:31.999 --> 05:34.066
it's like a place where people
can come and get coffee,

05:34.101 --> 05:36.168
um, or drinks,
but it's not a coffee shop,

05:36.203 --> 05:38.070
nor is it a bar.

05:38.105 --> 05:41.139
- Okay, so we're pretty clear
on what it's not.

05:41.174 --> 05:42.607
- Yeah, it's an environment.

05:42.642 --> 05:45.344
And yes, we will be
selling things,

05:45.379 --> 05:46.812
but it's more like...

05:46.847 --> 05:49.681
more like a branded
immersive experience.

05:49.716 --> 05:52.317
- Right, I love the buzzwords,
David,

05:52.352 --> 05:55.487

something down here.

anything I just said?

05:58.525 --> 05:59.858
- I'll tell you what.

05:59.893 --> 06:01.560
Why don't you take these
home with you,

06:01.595 --> 06:03.528
and just fill them out
when you have a...

06:03.563 --> 06:05.864
a clearer idea of what you want
to do with your business.

06:05.899 --> 06:07.866

06:07.901 --> 06:10.635

06:10.670 --> 06:13.472
- Oh! You've settled
on a name, then?

06:14.808 --> 06:16.441

very impatient,

06:16.476 --> 06:18.710
or extremely sure of yourself.

06:18.745 --> 06:20.645
- I threw you a bit
of a change-up there, huh?

06:20.680 --> 06:22.247

what that means,

06:22.282 --> 06:23.715

will need it.

all that when you depart.

are in the room?

07:03.523 --> 07:04.923

to get a cot,

07:06.860 --> 07:08.660

put in the room?

07:08.695 --> 07:10.796

07:10.831 --> 07:13.598
- No, I use it to lay out
my clothes.

07:13.633 --> 07:15.867
- The chest of drawers
should suffice, no?

07:15.902 --> 07:18.336
- I like to see all my clothes
at once.

07:18.371 --> 07:20.872
- Might the other bed not do?

07:20.907 --> 07:22.207
- Yes...

07:22.242 --> 07:24.543
Except I haven't decided
which bed to sleep in,

07:24.578 --> 07:26.311
so that's tricky.

07:26.346 --> 07:28.346
Really, the cot would be best.

07:28.381 --> 07:30.382
- A cot it is, then.
- Thank you.

07:30.417 --> 07:32.784
Oh, and are the pillows
feather, or foam?

07:32.819 --> 07:34.953
- Yes.
- Sorry, which one?

07:34.988 --> 07:36.988
- I don't care.
- I'm sorry?

07:37.023 --> 07:38.557
- I don't know!

07:38.592 --> 07:40.225
I'm not entirely versed

07:40.260 --> 07:42.694
of the motel's pillow
collection.

07:42.729 --> 07:44.096

08:27.073 --> 08:28.840
Well, you have to go back

08:28.875 --> 08:30.675
that information was founded

08:30.710 --> 08:32.944
on practical experience
in the field!

08:32.979 --> 08:35.914
- It should've been founded
on my research.

08:38.919 --> 08:40.752

08:42.255 --> 08:43.622
- I didn't do anything!

08:43.657 --> 08:45.023
I didn't do anything
with your paper.

08:45.058 --> 08:48.126
your laptop was open, I did...

08:48.161 --> 08:49.861
a little editing, nothing major.

08:49.896 --> 08:52.197
- I've been accused
of plagiarism!

08:52.232 --> 08:54.666
- What?

08:54.701 --> 08:56.134
- Yeah!

08:56.169 --> 08:58.770
Jocelyn thought I cheated
because "someone"

08:58.805 --> 09:01.206
used words like duplexity,

09:01.241 --> 09:02.741
and backtowards!

09:02.776 --> 09:04.409
- Untoward.
- Whatever!

09:04.444 --> 09:06.044
And now I have to do
the whole thing again,

09:06.079 --> 09:08.380
when my original paper
was totally fine!

09:08.415 --> 09:09.948
- Well, it wasn't totally
fine, honey.

09:09.983 --> 09:12.150
There was questionable grammar,

09:12.185 --> 09:14.119
and a few spelling mistakes,
and I mean--

09:14.154 --> 09:16.121
- Dad!
- All right, I'll back off.

09:16.156 --> 09:17.656
- Thank you!

09:17.691 --> 09:19.124
- Just out of curiosity,

09:19.159 --> 09:21.593
did she happen to say anything
about that quote

09:21.628 --> 09:23.495
from Lee Iacocca?

09:29.035 --> 09:30.902
(Suitcase rattles)

09:32.639 --> 09:34.072
(Birds chirp)

09:37.877 --> 09:39.211

09:39.246 --> 09:40.679
- Those are the clean sheets.

09:40.714 --> 09:42.447
- No, I know.

09:42.482 --> 09:45.083
Um, so I went to incorporate
earlier today,

09:45.118 --> 09:47.919
and some guy basically told me

09:47.954 --> 09:49.821
that my business was a failure.

09:49.856 --> 09:52.123
- What?!
- Yeah!

09:52.158 --> 09:53.825
- Who told you that?

09:53.860 --> 09:56.094
- Some guy who's working
at Ray's.

09:56.129 --> 09:57.996
- Some guy who's working
at Ray's

09:58.031 --> 09:59.664
told you your business
was a failure?

09:59.699 --> 10:01.766
- Basically, yeah.

10:01.801 --> 10:04.202
- Oh well, what did he say?

10:04.237 --> 10:06.238
- He told me to come
back to him

10:06.273 --> 10:09.274
once I had a clearer idea
of what my business was.

10:09.309 --> 10:11.743
- And then he told you
it was a failure?

10:11.778 --> 10:15.013
- Well no, not like--
not exactly.

10:15.048 --> 10:16.815
- I'm sorry, I'm just trying
to figure out

10:16.850 --> 10:18.783
when he called your business
a failure.

10:18.818 --> 10:21.219
- Okay, maybe he didn't call
my business a failure,

10:21.254 --> 10:23.321
but it was insinuated.

10:23.356 --> 10:24.789
- Okay.

10:26.393 --> 10:30.128
So you know that I think your
business is a good idea,

10:30.163 --> 10:31.997
and you know that I mean that,

10:32.032 --> 10:34.432
because I'm incapable
of faking sincerity.

10:34.467 --> 10:37.702
I'm also just incapable
of sincerity in general.

10:37.737 --> 10:39.471
- Okay, you know what,
I'm going through it right now,

10:39.506 --> 10:41.706
and I actually think that
I might've been the one

10:41.741 --> 10:44.776
that insinuated that
my business was a failure.

10:44.811 --> 10:47.279
- Wait, you blew something
out of proportion?

10:47.314 --> 10:49.114
- No, what if he's right?

10:49.149 --> 10:52.117
I am sitting on a big,
empty space,

10:54.554 --> 10:56.321
and I couldn't even tell him
what I wanted to do with it!

10:56.356 --> 10:57.989
- You're freaking out.
- Uh--

10:58.024 --> 11:00.292
- Because you know what you
wanna do with your business,

11:00.327 --> 11:03.161
you have walked me through it
one too many times.

11:03.196 --> 11:06.197
So he was probably just
trying to help.

11:06.232 --> 11:08.533
- No, I mean,
he was very snippy.

11:08.568 --> 11:09.801
- Okay, um...

11:11.338 --> 11:13.271
I found this under
the bed in room two,

11:13.306 --> 11:14.973

18:39.552 --> 18:41.753
- It's my responsibility
to relate my experience

18:41.788 --> 18:44.322
to other customers.
- Is it?

18:44.357 --> 18:46.424
- I didn't even mention that
the hot water runs brown

18:46.459 --> 18:47.825
for three seconds.

18:47.860 --> 18:49.227
- All right, I'll agree,

18:49.262 --> 18:51.028
this motel could use
some improvements.

18:51.063 --> 18:54.198
But your review will scare off
the guests we need

18:54.233 --> 18:56.267
to afford those improvements.

18:56.302 --> 18:57.902
- I was just being honest.

18:57.937 --> 18:59.804
- I see.

18:59.839 --> 19:02.340
Then I suppose I should
be honest.

19:02.375 --> 19:05.243
My daughter married a man
who turned out to be her uncle.

19:05.278 --> 19:07.111
- I'm sorry?

19:07.146 --> 19:09.914
- The lowlife uncle she
believed to have been executed

19:09.949 --> 19:12.316
years before by the Indian
cartel.

19:12.351 --> 19:14.185
This is all on my ex-husband's
side,

19:14.220 --> 19:16.154
I'm good people,
and so's my daughter.

19:16.189 --> 19:18.723
She had nothing to do
with Raven's accident.

19:18.758 --> 19:20.958
When the Bangalores
finally found Dagger,

19:20.993 --> 19:23.027
and gave him what he deserved,

19:23.062 --> 19:25.163
they threatened to burn
down the motel,

19:25.198 --> 19:27.732
and leave my pregnant baby
penniless.

19:27.767 --> 19:29.200
- This motel?

19:29.235 --> 19:31.702
She begged them
to let her keep this place,

19:31.737 --> 19:34.539
and she promised them a cut
of the profits in return.

19:34.574 --> 19:36.707
They laughed, and left,

19:36.742 --> 19:40.378
but not without first shaving
all her beautiful hair!

19:40.413 --> 19:43.714
When people ask me, why do you
work here for nothing?

19:43.749 --> 19:46.017
I tell them, this is my flesh
and blood!

19:46.052 --> 19:47.385
I do this for her!

19:47.420 --> 19:50.888
Nothing! She is my everything!

19:50.923 --> 19:53.424
- Okay, wow, I had no idea.

19:53.459 --> 19:55.293
I can take down that review.

19:55.328 --> 19:56.894
- Oh, I--
- I'll take it down.

19:56.929 --> 19:58.763
- Oh, do what you must.

19:58.798 --> 20:00.264
(Sobs)

20:04.136 --> 20:06.437
(Birds chirp)

20:06.472 --> 20:08.973
(People chatter, dishes clink)

20:09.008 --> 20:10.374
- Good morning, Roses.

20:10.409 --> 20:12.310
I just wanted to pop by
to congratulate Alexis

20:12.345 --> 20:14.345
on her economics paper.

20:14.380 --> 20:16.447
Johnny: Oh honey,
that's great news!

20:16.482 --> 20:18.883
- Our little woman of academia!

20:18.918 --> 20:21.018
David: I would love to read
this economics paper.

20:21.053 --> 20:23.154
- I will admit that your thesis

20:23.189 --> 20:24.889
of "why shop in store when
you can buy online"

20:24.924 --> 20:26.457
was a little off-topic,

20:26.492 --> 20:28.659
but still a really fresh take.

20:28.694 --> 20:30.361
- Thank you.

20:30.396 --> 20:32.930
- Well, look at you, Alexis,
acing your paper!

20:32.965 --> 20:34.265
- Oh, no, no, God no.

20:34.300 --> 20:36.300
I gave her a solid C plus.

20:36.335 --> 20:38.302
- Oh, so she did
write it herself.

20:38.337 --> 20:39.770
- It was a noticeable
improvement

20:39.805 --> 20:41.205
over the first paper.

20:41.240 --> 20:42.640
- Um well, I should hope so!

20:42.675 --> 20:45.109
- Well, m-maybe not
a noticeable improvement,

20:45.144 --> 20:47.445
but um, a different
improvement.

20:47.480 --> 20:50.314
- No, no, this one
was definitely better.

20:50.349 --> 20:52.316
Because no one helped her
write it.

20:53.753 --> 20:54.952
Enjoy your breakfast.

20:56.656 --> 20:58.155
David: Mm!

20:58.190 --> 21:00.591
Have you seen Dad's coasters?

21:03.029 --> 21:07.665
- "Follow us on tweeters!"

21:09.168 --> 21:11.502
Tweeters!

21:11.537 --> 21:14.305
- We're going to get lots
of disciples, dear.
