WEBVTT

00:02.601 --> 00:03.726
-Felix.
-Oh, he cute.

00:03.726 --> 00:04.809
Okay, what about neighbor Beck?

00:04.809 --> 00:06.184
Oh, I'm still
keeping him around.

00:06.184 --> 00:07.893
-Mm-hmm.
-Just get a few more.

00:08.184 --> 00:10.434
-This bitch building a roster.
-Yep.

00:11.184 --> 00:12.225
MOLLY: (ON PHONE)
Lionel's great.

00:12.434 --> 00:14.434
He's attractive, smart,
he making the money.

00:14.434 --> 00:17.392
-But?
-I just don't know what it is.

00:18.559 --> 00:20.184
-We should probably stop.
-Molly, it's cool.

00:20.184 --> 00:22.059
Candace and I,
we're open.

00:22.351 --> 00:23.476
So, they both step out?

00:23.476 --> 00:25.225
Is anyone married
like my parents anymore?

00:25.225 --> 00:27.225
Shit, I didn't even know
and I do their taxes.

00:27.601 --> 00:30.392
I can't believe you
just met two bitches
at the grocery store.

00:30.392 --> 00:31.476
It was great, right?

00:31.768 --> 00:32.809
Yeah, it was great.

00:34.768 --> 00:36.309
I shouldn't have said
what I said, or--

00:36.309 --> 00:39.809
It was months ago, you know?
It-- it happened. I'm good.

00:47.851 --> 00:50.017

00:50.017 --> 00:52.142

on the stoop.

01:24.934 --> 01:27.351
You have to sign for it.

01:27.351 --> 01:29.017
It's a package

01:29.017 --> 01:30.476
for your package.

01:30.476 --> 01:31.934
Handle with care.

01:31.934 --> 01:34.434
Or not.
( giggles )

01:34.434 --> 01:36.351
I got a gun.

01:36.351 --> 01:37.851
It's Issa!

01:37.851 --> 01:39.184
( chuckles )

01:41.225 --> 01:43.184
( both chuckle )

01:43.184 --> 01:44.059

01:56.267 --> 01:57.851
So just follow up
with Sharon.

01:57.851 --> 01:59.726
She's our senior associate
who covers that area.

01:59.726 --> 02:01.100
Wait, which one
is Sharon again?

02:01.100 --> 02:03.267
We just walked
past her office.

02:03.267 --> 02:04.975
She had on a tan suit.

02:04.975 --> 02:06.225
Look like T-Boz.

02:06.225 --> 02:07.893
The one that was reading
"Think Like a Man"?

02:07.893 --> 02:10.559
- ( laughs )
- There's really
a lot of us here.

02:10.559 --> 02:12.142
Look, I don't know
how you do it.

02:12.142 --> 02:14.975
I mean,
the LA office remind me
of why I went to Howard.

02:14.975 --> 02:18.434
It reminds me
of why that Solange album
stays on repeat in my car.

02:18.434 --> 02:21.059
So, um,
did you tell them

02:21.059 --> 02:22.975
that you know the white boy
make more than you?

02:22.975 --> 02:25.059
You know I can't
say anything.

02:25.059 --> 02:26.100
Hey, look.

02:28.267 --> 02:31.351
- You ever think
about leaving?
- Leaving?

02:31.351 --> 02:34.059
You know MJ&S is not
the only good firm.

02:34.059 --> 02:35.476
You need
to just get out of LA

02:35.476 --> 02:37.434
and move to a city
with a real football team.

02:37.434 --> 02:39.434
Okay, calm down.
The Bears suck, so.

02:39.434 --> 02:41.517
Okay, you just got
the Rams.

02:41.517 --> 02:44.476
- ( both laugh )
- Plus, I've already
been there for four years.

02:44.476 --> 02:46.517
I'm not about to just
let that time go to waste.

02:46.517 --> 02:48.975
Look, Molly,
all I'm saying is
you have options.

02:48.975 --> 02:52.267
You bring a lot
to the table if it's
at MJ&S or somewhere else.

02:52.267 --> 02:54.267
I really do appreciate
you saying that.

02:54.267 --> 02:57.517
Well, appreciate it
by bringing me some Roscoe's
next time you come.

02:57.517 --> 03:00.059
So I can be
the black girl on a plane
with fried chicken?

03:00.059 --> 03:02.934
- Nope.
- Come on, now. You ain't
gonna feed a brother?

03:02.934 --> 03:04.309
I done gave you
some advice.

03:04.309 --> 03:06.184
I'm slim thick.
You gotta feed me.

03:06.184 --> 03:09.809
- ( laughing )
- I got a pastor's body.
Don't laugh.

03:11.809 --> 03:15.975
Massa, why you let 'Nessa
shave you this morning?

03:15.975 --> 03:17.434
Oh, Ninny...

03:19.059 --> 03:22.309
she only trimmed
the tree.

03:22.309 --> 03:23.809
I'll let you
tend the bush.

03:25.476 --> 03:27.726
Ooh, 'Nessa about to get got,
messing with Ninny's man.

03:27.726 --> 03:29.476
This show is so stupid.

03:29.476 --> 03:32.643
- Oh, you leaving?
- Yeah, I was just about
to head out.

03:32.643 --> 03:34.684
( sighs )

03:37.726 --> 03:40.267
- Mmm.
- Oh.

03:40.267 --> 03:42.017
You got plans
tomorrow night?

03:43.392 --> 03:46.684
I don't know.

03:46.684 --> 03:48.851
Do you?

03:48.851 --> 03:49.893
Maybe.

03:53.184 --> 03:55.059
Tsk, you ain't got
no plans.

03:55.059 --> 03:57.309
( both laugh )

03:57.309 --> 03:59.476
( clears throat )

03:59.476 --> 04:02.517
- Where you going?
- About to go to Brolly Hut.

04:02.517 --> 04:05.351
So, you're just gonna get
pastrami tacos without me?

04:05.351 --> 04:06.601
Niggas ain't shit.

04:06.601 --> 04:09.017
( chuckles )
We're not.

04:09.017 --> 04:10.142
( laughs )

04:11.684 --> 04:13.517
( panting )

04:15.184 --> 04:16.684
Yo, so, nobody's heard
from Gary?

04:16.684 --> 04:17.809
Last thing I heard,
he was yelling,

04:17.809 --> 04:20.601
"Slow down,
you fuckers!"

04:20.601 --> 04:22.392
- You calling him?
- No.

04:22.392 --> 04:23.809
I gotta check and see
if I have jury duty
in the morning.

04:23.809 --> 04:26.225
Man, jury duty's
the fucking worst.

04:28.309 --> 04:29.975
You got called, huh?

04:29.975 --> 04:31.809
Aw, you're gonna miss
Colin and me pitching
your app tomorrow.

04:31.809 --> 04:33.434
Oh, sitting
in a courtroom all day

04:33.434 --> 04:35.768
or listening to Colin talk
for 10 minutes straight--

04:35.768 --> 04:37.184
not sure what's worse.

04:37.184 --> 04:39.225
- ( panting )
- Aparna: Oh, looky here.

04:39.225 --> 04:42.434
- Fuck this fucking marathon.
- ( all laughing )

04:42.434 --> 04:45.059
- Brooke: Gar-bear!
- Aparna: Oh, Gary!

04:45.059 --> 04:46.225
Cheese.

04:46.225 --> 04:48.059
- Gary: Cheese.
- ( camera clicks )

04:48.059 --> 04:51.851
Girl, I found us
a bomb-ass hotel
in Morocco to stay at.

04:51.851 --> 04:53.643
Palais Faraj.

04:53.643 --> 04:56.267
That's French
for "palace," bitch.

04:56.267 --> 04:59.267
Okay, well, I will be
staying at the Motel "See,"

04:59.267 --> 05:02.726
and that's French
for "I'm broke as fuck," bitch.

05:02.726 --> 05:04.975
Tsk, can you hand me
the birds of paradise,
please?

05:04.975 --> 05:06.559
I wanna add them
to these roses.

05:06.559 --> 05:08.434
- This is
a big-ass bouquet.
- I know.

05:08.434 --> 05:10.851
My dad has been
so fucking extra
with this vow renewal.

05:10.851 --> 05:14.601
Talking about some
"I want it to look like
an ocean of flowers."

05:14.601 --> 05:16.267
He lucky I don't drown
these shits.

05:16.267 --> 05:18.434
I love your parents.
They're so cute.

05:18.434 --> 05:20.559
- You sure you don't
wanna come?
- No, girl.

05:20.559 --> 05:22.684
I told you, I got
this fuck-ass
work retreat.

05:22.684 --> 05:24.142
( phone buzzes )

05:27.392 --> 05:30.601
- Who's that?
- Huh? Oh, just Daniel.

05:30.601 --> 05:32.184
Oh, y'all cool now?

05:32.184 --> 05:34.517
Wait, what'd you call him?
The zit you had to pop?

05:34.517 --> 05:36.934
Wait, or was it a rash
you had to put ointment on?

05:36.934 --> 05:38.851
You know what?
We're fine, okay?

05:38.851 --> 05:42.142
Daniel and I have history
and we always bounce back.

05:42.142 --> 05:44.934
Oh, so y'all can just be cool
without catching feelings?

05:44.934 --> 05:47.267
- Yeah, we're friends
who fuck.
- M'kay.

05:47.267 --> 05:48.851
Daniel knows what it is.

05:48.851 --> 05:51.559
Plus I told you, I'm not about
this feeling shit right now.

05:51.559 --> 05:53.684
Listen, if you like it,
I love it.

05:53.684 --> 05:56.309
- Get yours.
- Oh, I sure the fuck will.

05:56.309 --> 05:58.559
Because I am
all about what?

05:58.559 --> 06:00.893
Putting niggas
in my "hotation."

06:00.893 --> 06:03.059
Oh, oh, we got--
we got a hotation?

06:03.059 --> 06:05.059
- Listen, I got Daniel.
- Okay.

06:05.059 --> 06:06.476
- I got neighbor bae.
- What?

06:06.476 --> 06:10.975
And I'm about to add
a new one tonight.

06:10.975 --> 06:13.142
- He Latino?
- Sí,  bitch!

06:13.142 --> 06:15.017
( trilling, laughs )

06:15.017 --> 06:16.809
That was really racist.

06:16.809 --> 06:18.684
Narrator on TV:
What's the first thing
you think of

06:18.684 --> 06:21.601
when you hear the words
"jury duty"?

06:21.601 --> 06:24.225
- Is it finding
an excuse not to serve?
- ( phone buzzes )

06:24.225 --> 06:26.809
Or the inconvenience
to your schedule?

06:26.809 --> 06:28.893
Or being absent from work?

06:28.893 --> 06:32.559
It's time
to take a fresh look
at jury service,

06:32.559 --> 06:34.726
not as a duty,
but as a privilege,

06:34.726 --> 06:38.017
and see why
there's no justice
without you.

06:38.017 --> 06:41.225
It all starts
with the selection process

06:41.225 --> 06:43.559
where jurors are chosen.

06:43.559 --> 06:46.225
Today I wanna talk to you
about the world's
hottest pepper--

06:46.225 --> 06:48.059
the Carolina Reaper.

06:48.059 --> 06:49.517
( laughing, crunches )

06:49.517 --> 06:52.017
Mmm... fuck!

06:52.017 --> 06:53.559
- What is wrong with her?
- Kelli: Oh, God!

06:53.559 --> 06:57.559
Would the following jurors
please report to courtroom 65?

06:57.559 --> 07:00.684
Javier Alvarado,
Francis Butler,

07:00.684 --> 07:04.184
Rodrigo Fuentes,
Edwin Gordon,

07:04.184 --> 07:06.851
Karen James,
Joseph Lin,

07:06.851 --> 07:10.017
Rachel Simmons,
Lawrence Walker,

07:10.017 --> 07:12.059
and Thomas Williams.

07:14.768 --> 07:16.768
Just a reminder,
I am still looking to name

07:16.768 --> 07:20.059
a Director of Student Outreach
for We Got Y'all.

07:20.059 --> 07:21.975
And don't forget
tomorrow's retreat

07:21.975 --> 07:23.601
will begin promptly
at 9:00 a.m.

07:23.601 --> 07:27.059
So, we're coming to work
on a Saturday... for free?

07:27.059 --> 07:31.017
And also,
we will be partnering
with Inner-City Arts

07:31.017 --> 07:33.225
to give opportunities
to students

07:33.225 --> 07:34.975
who have an interest
in the arts.

07:34.975 --> 07:38.392
So, everyone, think
about which of your kids
would be a good fit.

07:38.392 --> 07:42.017
God, arts education
is so important for kids
like these.

07:42.017 --> 07:46.476
- Especially in this climate.
- Betsy DeVos.

07:46.476 --> 07:48.601
Joanne:
And with the state of things
in this country,

07:48.601 --> 07:51.100
people seem to not
be hearing each other.

07:51.100 --> 07:53.434
I bet you
she's gonna say
"now more than ever."

07:53.434 --> 07:57.643
...unity are
vital to our mission
now more than ever.

08:01.934 --> 08:03.601
( bubbling )

08:07.267 --> 08:08.684
Hey, can we talk?

08:08.684 --> 08:10.851
Honestly,
I don't know
what to say.

08:10.851 --> 08:13.434
Well, clearly you're upset
about something, so...

08:13.434 --> 08:14.934
you know you can
just talk to me.

08:16.893 --> 08:18.434
I still feel weird

08:18.434 --> 08:20.809
about just going along
with Gaines.

08:20.809 --> 08:22.351
( scoffs )
Still?

08:22.351 --> 08:24.934
I was just trying to make
the best out of the situation.

08:24.934 --> 08:28.017
It seemed like you were trying
to help yourself more than--

08:28.017 --> 08:30.975
Do you know how many
racist-ass Gaines types
there are out there?

08:30.975 --> 08:33.100
And, truthfully,

08:33.100 --> 08:35.893
black people can't really
be racist like that, so.

08:35.893 --> 08:36.934
Yes, they can.

08:36.934 --> 08:38.434
Racism is about
having the power

08:38.434 --> 08:41.184
to manipulate a situation
against someone.

08:41.184 --> 08:44.434
Oh, so you're just
gonna be literal?

08:44.434 --> 08:46.893
- Yes.
- It must be nice
to have the privilege

08:46.893 --> 08:48.975
to choose to be upset
over this.

08:48.975 --> 08:50.975
So, you're saying
I  can never call out

08:50.975 --> 08:52.809
when someone of color's
doing something wrong?

08:52.809 --> 08:54.517
- Kinda.
- That's not fair.

08:54.517 --> 08:56.726
- Well, that's
the world we live in.
- Maybe it is.

08:56.726 --> 08:58.726
I just expected
more from you.

08:58.726 --> 09:00.768
( bubbling continues )

09:04.809 --> 09:07.768
I would leave,
but I literally
just filled up the water.

09:10.809 --> 09:12.184
Yo, yo.

09:12.184 --> 09:14.142
What you doing here
so early?

09:14.142 --> 09:16.851
Came up last night
to hang with the parents.

09:16.851 --> 09:18.309
Oh, okay.
I see.

09:18.309 --> 09:22.100
So, we just out here
wearing tight T-shirts now?

09:22.100 --> 09:25.309
Okay, well, I mean,
if people out here
noticing, then, yeah.

09:25.309 --> 09:27.684
- Man, your pops still
didn't fix that gate, huh?
- ( both laugh )

09:27.684 --> 09:29.851
Used to wake up
the whole block
when you missed curfew.

09:29.851 --> 09:31.684
Man, my dad
ain't fixing that gate.

09:31.684 --> 09:34.351
- It's the only alarm we got.
- ( both laugh )

09:34.351 --> 09:37.601
Well, I wanted to catch you
before tomorrow,

09:37.601 --> 09:39.351
make sure
we all cool and...

09:39.351 --> 09:40.893
Yeah, we good.

09:40.893 --> 09:43.809
I know
I dropped a lot on you
at Kiss-n-Grind, so.

09:43.809 --> 09:48.184
It kind of was,
but we were both
pretty drunk.

09:48.184 --> 09:50.017
I wasn't that drunk.

09:51.517 --> 09:53.476
You never thought
about us like that?

09:53.476 --> 09:55.559
I mean, yeah, when you had
your colored contacts in.

09:55.559 --> 09:59.392
I was like, "Okay."
But then you took them out
and I was like, "Nah."

09:59.392 --> 10:00.851
Don't do that.

10:00.851 --> 10:02.559
Yeah, I've thought
about it.

10:02.559 --> 10:05.643
I've been
thinking about you,
but you're married.

10:05.643 --> 10:07.893
So, open or not,

10:07.893 --> 10:10.059
that's just not
how I see my life.

10:11.267 --> 10:13.434
Okay, yeah.
No, I get it.

10:13.434 --> 10:16.184
Look, well, just know
we will always be good.

10:16.184 --> 10:18.726
- No matter what.
- Good.

10:18.726 --> 10:20.267
Tomorrow should be fun.

10:20.267 --> 10:23.517
So, get ready,
'cause I am going
to wear my tight suit.

10:23.517 --> 10:24.643
Oh, okay.

10:24.643 --> 10:26.225
Is it gonna be
tighter than this shirt?

10:26.225 --> 10:27.726
- Bam!
- Okay...

10:27.726 --> 10:31.601
Your Honor, I have
just a few more questions
for Juror #9.

10:31.601 --> 10:33.351
Judge:
Okay, proceed.

10:33.351 --> 10:36.851
Juror #9,
have you ever testified
in any court proceeding?

10:36.851 --> 10:39.100
- No.
- Do you harbor any bias

10:39.100 --> 10:40.893
towards the Los Angeles
Police Department?

10:40.893 --> 10:42.059
Actually...

10:44.768 --> 10:46.267
Not buying it.

10:48.517 --> 10:52.184
Attorney:
Your Honor, the defense
would like to dismiss Juror #3.

10:52.184 --> 10:54.975
Judge:
Juror #3,
you're dismissed.

10:54.975 --> 10:56.351
Juror #3.

10:56.351 --> 10:58.142
While you're still young!

11:02.184 --> 11:04.434
Y'all are really going
all out for this, huh?

11:04.434 --> 11:07.017
Oh, please, I got
these champagne glasses

11:07.017 --> 11:08.975
from the little
Mexican dollar store.

11:08.975 --> 11:10.975
They're probably
full of lead.

11:10.975 --> 11:14.100
- Besides, I'm saving
for somebody's wedding.
- ( tsks, groans )

11:14.100 --> 11:16.434
You know, Costco
is selling atriums now.

11:16.434 --> 11:18.267
Cee-Cee,
Molly is too special

11:18.267 --> 11:21.893
to settle for
the first little ashy boy
who wants to put a ring on it.

11:21.893 --> 11:23.267
Thank you, Daddy.

11:24.726 --> 11:26.142
- Ooh.
- Okay.

11:26.142 --> 11:28.601
Now, don't start nothing
you can't finish.

11:28.601 --> 11:30.809
- Oh, yuck, please stop.
- ( parents laughing )

11:30.809 --> 11:32.851
- Hey.
- Oh, come on, now.

11:32.851 --> 11:35.184
Red cups?
What you think
this is, Freaknik?

11:35.184 --> 11:36.975
( laughs )
What's up, Mo?

11:36.975 --> 11:40.225
- What's up, Big Head?
- Hey, Curtis. Hey, Ugly.

11:40.225 --> 11:42.684
Hey, I thought you said
those were yours.

11:42.684 --> 11:44.934
- Yeah, they are.
- You ain't never
gave us one.

11:44.934 --> 11:47.225
- Ah...
- Mmm.

11:47.225 --> 11:49.392
You gonna drink it
in front of my face?

11:49.392 --> 11:52.309
- I can't stand you.
- Wait, it took two of you
to pick that up?

11:52.309 --> 11:55.476
- You know Jerome don't drive.
- Man, I don't need to.
Michelle drive.

11:55.476 --> 11:58.309
I don't even understand
how your scrub-ass self
gets bitches.

11:58.309 --> 12:01.142
Like this.
( snaps fingers )

12:01.142 --> 12:03.726
- Stupid, man...
- Mm-mm. I'm done.

12:03.726 --> 12:09.684
♪ Baby, I want
some of your love ♪

12:09.684 --> 12:13.434
♪ Your love, your love,
your love ♪

12:13.434 --> 12:19.059
♪ Baby, can I have
some of your ♪

12:19.059 --> 12:23.017
♪ Your love,
your love? ♪

12:23.017 --> 12:26.851
Come through, Tinder.
Come through.

12:26.851 --> 12:28.975
Hi. Nico?

12:28.975 --> 12:31.059
- Issa?
- Hi.

12:31.059 --> 12:31.975
Uh...

12:34.309 --> 12:36.726
So, uh,
what are we drinking?

12:36.726 --> 12:38.809
Well, this place is known
for their martinis.

12:38.809 --> 12:40.768
I heard that they infuse
a lot of their gins.

12:40.768 --> 12:43.059
Fuck gin.
I want the horchata.

12:43.059 --> 12:46.601
Easy on the chata,
heavy on the whore.

12:46.601 --> 12:49.726
- You pick.
- Don't worry,
you're in good hands.

12:49.726 --> 12:51.142
Are you good
with your hands?

12:51.142 --> 12:53.351
Or are you better
with your dick?

12:55.059 --> 12:57.851
Yeah, to be honest,
I'm not really much
of a martini guy.

12:57.851 --> 12:59.975
I was only trying
to impress.

12:59.975 --> 13:03.017
Well, I bought it,
so I'm clearly easy.

13:03.017 --> 13:05.059
To-- to impress.

13:05.059 --> 13:07.559
Well, now that we're throwing
the cards on the table,

13:07.559 --> 13:11.225
I should tell you that I caught
that Spider-Man reference
in your profile.

13:11.225 --> 13:13.893
- Marvel, huh?
- All day.

13:13.893 --> 13:15.768
See, the thing is
I'm a DC guy.

13:15.768 --> 13:17.434
- What?!
- Oh, come on.

13:17.434 --> 13:18.934
Superman beats
Spider-Man.

13:18.934 --> 13:20.893
I mean, Superman's dog
beats Spider-Man.

13:20.893 --> 13:22.225
You know what?
I should go.

13:22.225 --> 13:23.893
Actually, you should.

13:23.893 --> 13:27.309
Okay, here, hold on.
Excuse me, drink, please?

13:27.309 --> 13:29.059
( phone buzzes )

13:32.309 --> 13:33.975
Nicely poured.

13:33.975 --> 13:36.142
- For you.
- Thank you.

13:36.142 --> 13:38.934
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

13:38.934 --> 13:40.601
- ( music playing )
- I love it.

13:40.601 --> 13:42.434
( both laugh )

13:42.434 --> 13:43.975
You guys
doing okay, or...?

13:43.975 --> 13:45.351
Uh, did you want
anything else?

13:45.351 --> 13:46.643
No, I'm good,
thank you.

13:46.643 --> 13:48.601
I think we're good.
Thank you.

13:51.267 --> 13:53.934
- Oh.
- If you're gonna go for it,
you've gotta commit to it.

13:53.934 --> 13:55.893
- What? I did.
- Uh-huh.

13:55.893 --> 13:58.434
Next time, don't stop
until I say, "I got it."

13:58.434 --> 13:59.934
Noted.

13:59.934 --> 14:02.434
- Well, thank you.
- You're very welcome.

14:04.559 --> 14:06.934
Wow, it's almost midnight.

14:06.934 --> 14:10.392
- Time just flew by.
- Yeah.

14:10.392 --> 14:11.809
But I'm not tired.

14:11.809 --> 14:14.809
So, if you want,
we could keep hanging out.

14:14.809 --> 14:17.517
I wish.
I have to get up
super early.

14:17.517 --> 14:19.643
I have a flight
in the morning, so.

14:19.643 --> 14:21.142
Oh, okay.

14:21.142 --> 14:24.351
But, hey, this is an excuse
for us to do this again.

14:24.351 --> 14:27.309
- Okay.
- ( chuckles )

14:29.893 --> 14:32.893
...only then can
we truly achieve empathy.

14:32.893 --> 14:35.851
Let's practice
how we listen

14:35.851 --> 14:39.142
to students experiencing
personal challenges.

14:39.142 --> 14:43.601
Those skills would be
especially important
for whomever I name

14:43.601 --> 14:46.975
as our new Director
of Student Outreach.

14:46.975 --> 14:50.476
Issa, Frieda, Kitty, Ken,
please come up.

14:52.142 --> 14:54.768
- Why don't you go first?
- Okay.

14:54.768 --> 14:56.851
"A student who was
formerly engaged

14:56.851 --> 14:59.559
is now talking back
and missing assignments.

14:59.559 --> 15:02.392
What are some possible
underlying causes?"

15:02.392 --> 15:04.059
Um, mm.

15:04.059 --> 15:06.059
Okay, so,
my first thought
might be

15:06.059 --> 15:07.851
has something
in their home life
changed?

15:07.851 --> 15:11.517
Okay, I'd wanna know
if any of their parents

15:11.517 --> 15:16.225
are affiliated
with any organizations.

15:16.225 --> 15:18.184
I mean, we're all
thinking drugs, right?

15:18.184 --> 15:20.142
Are they old enough
to get pregnant?

15:20.142 --> 15:22.517
Because they're
probably pregnant.

15:22.517 --> 15:24.059
Maybe instead
of assuming,

15:24.059 --> 15:27.851
we should just ask them
what the hell is going on.

15:27.851 --> 15:28.975
Sorry.

15:28.975 --> 15:31.017
No, it's the retreat.

15:31.017 --> 15:33.684
Honestly, sometimes
it's more than one thing.

15:33.684 --> 15:35.059
And these are kids.

15:35.059 --> 15:36.934
Even adults can have
a hard time

15:36.934 --> 15:38.851
being honest
with themselves
about things.

15:38.851 --> 15:40.601
I agree with Frieda.

15:40.601 --> 15:42.851
We're mining
a deep vein, here.

15:42.851 --> 15:44.225
Let's keep digging.

15:44.225 --> 15:47.559
Everyone, pair up,
pick a card from the bowl.

15:47.559 --> 15:48.851
- Kitty: You wanna partner?
- Ken: Yeah.

15:48.851 --> 15:50.059
Kitty:
Okay, all right.

15:50.059 --> 15:52.351
Uh, you wanna be
my partner?

15:52.351 --> 15:53.726
Oh, we're really
doing this?

15:53.726 --> 15:56.142
Yeah, we're doing it.
Sit up. Up.

15:56.142 --> 15:58.559
- Patricia: You can do it.
- Frieda: Thank you.

16:00.643 --> 16:03.267
Hey, Sarah,
do you wanna partner up?

16:04.768 --> 16:07.309
( chatter )

16:07.309 --> 16:10.517
- Sure.
- Frieda: Okay, you learn
that a student

16:10.517 --> 16:12.851
is scared of going
for his dreams.

16:12.851 --> 16:14.601
Well, that's stupid.

16:14.601 --> 16:16.142
Dreams aren't meant
to be achieved.

16:16.142 --> 16:17.643
That's why
they're called dreams.

16:17.643 --> 16:19.601
Otherwise, they'd
be called reality, so.

16:19.601 --> 16:22.684
They might as well learn that
sooner rather than later.

16:22.684 --> 16:25.934
- That's kind of dark, Patricia.
- It's true.

16:25.934 --> 16:28.267
- These are beautiful, Mom.
- Thank you.

16:28.267 --> 16:30.267
I got the champagne
from the fridge.

16:30.267 --> 16:31.934
See something,
do something, right?

16:31.934 --> 16:32.975
Thank you.

16:32.975 --> 16:35.184
You're welcome.

16:35.184 --> 16:37.809
- Your parents
are kind of great.
- ( chuckles )

16:37.809 --> 16:39.726
Yeah, they are.

16:39.726 --> 16:42.934
- Man: Molly!
- Ah, Mr. and Mrs. Peña.

16:42.934 --> 16:46.142
- Ven.  Mwah!
- Oh, mwah!

16:46.142 --> 16:47.809
- So good.
- Thank you.

16:47.809 --> 16:50.059
I was just asking my parents
if they ever thought about

16:50.059 --> 16:51.434
renewing their
wedding vows.

16:51.434 --> 16:53.601
( speaking Spanish )

16:57.559 --> 16:59.975
Mrs. Peña: On that note,
we're gonna go find
your parents.

16:59.975 --> 17:01.392
- Come on, Papi.
- Sí, sí.

17:01.392 --> 17:03.309
- Sí, Mami.
- Hola.

17:05.851 --> 17:08.768
Oh, uh, Dro,
this is Lionel.
Lionel, Dro.

17:08.768 --> 17:10.225
- Pleasure.
- How you doing, Dro?

17:10.225 --> 17:12.309
- Good, good.
- Dro and I grew up together.

17:12.309 --> 17:14.309
Yeah, my parents' house is
right across the street there.

17:14.309 --> 17:16.100
- Okay.
- You two work together?

17:16.100 --> 17:17.643
- Uh, no.
- No.

17:17.643 --> 17:18.934
We met out.

17:18.934 --> 17:20.809
Yeah, Lionel's
a mortgage broker.

17:20.809 --> 17:22.601
Marketing consultant.

17:22.601 --> 17:24.809
- You are a...
- Both: Marketing consultant.

17:24.809 --> 17:27.142
Yes. Yes.

17:27.142 --> 17:28.184
Yeah.

17:29.309 --> 17:30.643
So, where's Candice?

17:30.643 --> 17:33.809
- Bachelorette party in Cabo.
- Jerome: Dro!

17:33.809 --> 17:35.643
Little bruv.

17:36.975 --> 17:39.225
- Hi!
- What's up?

17:39.225 --> 17:40.851
That dude is tall.

17:40.851 --> 17:42.893
Is he?

17:42.893 --> 17:44.768
- ( music playing )
- Nah, man, I didn't know.

17:44.768 --> 17:47.351
So, Tiffany hasn't said
anything about Issa and Daniel?

17:47.351 --> 17:49.017
After what happened
with the whole Tasha thing,

17:49.017 --> 17:51.309
Tiff and I had to stop
discussing y'all

17:51.309 --> 17:53.100
because we'd always
end up taking sides.

17:53.100 --> 17:54.768
It'd get real, bro.

17:54.768 --> 17:57.684
I just can't believe
Issa is still out here
seeing this dude.

17:57.684 --> 17:59.184
Yeah, man, I feel you.

17:59.184 --> 18:02.559
Yo, and now I'm like
was she playing me

18:02.559 --> 18:04.309
the whole time
we were together?

18:04.309 --> 18:06.267
Women are slick
about hiding their dirt.

18:06.267 --> 18:07.851
- Iss, slick?
- Yeah.

18:07.851 --> 18:10.726
You've seen her dance, right?
Or just, like, live?

18:10.726 --> 18:12.184
That's exactly why
you wouldn't expect it.

18:12.184 --> 18:13.893
'Cause they don't
seem like the type.

18:13.893 --> 18:16.934
I mean, how you know
that Tiffany isn't
out there just--

18:16.934 --> 18:19.184
- Come on.
- I'm just saying.

18:19.184 --> 18:21.351
All right,
I thought Issa and I
were in it together,

18:21.351 --> 18:25.059
but she was out there
doing whatever.

18:27.351 --> 18:30.684
Honestly,
this ain't all on Issa.

18:32.559 --> 18:34.100
What?

18:34.100 --> 18:38.017
I mean, you spent
two years unemployed,

18:38.017 --> 18:42.017
not doing shit,
letting your woman
take care of you.

18:42.017 --> 18:44.392
Kind of left
the door open.

18:44.392 --> 18:47.225
So, what?
That gives her the right
to fuck some other dude?

18:47.225 --> 18:49.893
No, but I can see
why she'd be attracted

18:49.893 --> 18:52.225
to a guy who's out there,
making things happen.

18:54.893 --> 18:57.059
Hey, can we get
two more?

18:57.059 --> 18:59.100
I appreciate it.

18:59.100 --> 19:00.975
( chatter )

19:00.975 --> 19:02.726
- Curtis: So, is that you?
- Molly: Yeah.

19:02.726 --> 19:04.309
We went out
a couple weeks ago

19:04.309 --> 19:05.975
and I decided
to give him another shot.

19:05.975 --> 19:07.768
Oh, so it's a pity date.

19:07.768 --> 19:09.392
- He went to Penn.
- He went to Penn?

19:09.392 --> 19:10.934
- He has a good job.
- Most niggas should.

19:10.934 --> 19:12.975
He's ready to settle down.
You know what?

19:12.975 --> 19:17.267
I figure if I'm ever gonna
have what Mom and Dad have,
I might as well just...

19:17.267 --> 19:18.559
Okay, look.

19:18.559 --> 19:20.559
Just because you meet
some good guy

19:20.559 --> 19:22.100
don't mean it's gonna
end up like Mom and Dad.

19:22.100 --> 19:23.768
Ain't no rule books
to this shit.

19:23.768 --> 19:26.142
You're just saying that
because you married
a stripper.

19:26.142 --> 19:27.809
No, I love Kim.

19:27.809 --> 19:29.726
She trapped me,
but I love her.

19:29.726 --> 19:31.309
I'm just being real.

19:31.309 --> 19:33.768
If you ain't
feeling this nigga,
then why you with him?

19:33.768 --> 19:35.643
Jerome:
Yo, Curtis, Curtis.

19:35.643 --> 19:37.309
I'm gonna kill
your fucking brother.

19:37.309 --> 19:40.851
- Curtis.
- What, nigga? Damn!

19:40.851 --> 19:42.934
- Jerome: You gonna
try to get a drink?
- Curtis: No, nigga, I'm not.

19:42.934 --> 19:45.017
- Jerome: Try the berry one?
- Curtis: No!

19:46.351 --> 19:48.309
( sighs )

19:51.809 --> 19:53.309
( phone buzzing )

19:53.309 --> 19:54.476
- Hey.
- Hey.

19:54.476 --> 19:55.726
Remember
when we were kids

19:55.726 --> 19:57.309
and that white girl
Amanda Johnson--

19:57.309 --> 19:59.434
- Samantha Bronson.
- Her.

19:59.434 --> 20:01.059
Remember how she swore
up and down

20:01.059 --> 20:02.893
that there was a sex scene
at the end of "Aladdin"

20:02.893 --> 20:04.934
and I knew there wasn't
because I had fast-forwarded

20:04.934 --> 20:07.225
to the end of the tape
and knew she was wrong?

20:07.225 --> 20:09.059
Why are
we talking about "Aladdin"
and little white girls?

20:09.059 --> 20:11.809
Because I was right then
and I'm right now.

20:11.809 --> 20:14.517
My self-righteous-ass coworker
is acting like I'm leaving out

20:14.517 --> 20:16.059
all the Latino kids
on purpose.

20:16.059 --> 20:17.726
Why you leaving out
all Latino kids?

20:17.726 --> 20:20.267
- Didn't nobody say "all."
- You literally just said "all."

20:20.267 --> 20:21.975
I know what I said,
and I didn't say "all."

20:21.975 --> 20:23.975
You can never admit
when you're wrong.

20:23.975 --> 20:26.684
Never say never, nigga!
How about that?

20:26.684 --> 20:28.684
Stupid-ass.

21:15.517 --> 21:16.975
Don't act like
we're the same age.

21:16.975 --> 21:20.225

Cousin Mary.

21:20.225 --> 21:23.309
So, brought you
a man this time.

21:23.309 --> 21:24.726

21:27.059 --> 21:29.559

David and Carol.

21:29.559 --> 21:31.100

21:31.100 --> 21:32.768
- Amazing.
- Mm-hmm!

21:32.768 --> 21:35.100
I didn't think
they were gonna make it
to 5, let alone 35.
