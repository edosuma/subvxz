02:27.500 --> 02:28.620

02:28.620 --> 02:30.110
<b>I had a great time!</b>

02:31.420 --> 02:34.250

02:34.250 --> 02:38.120
<b>Right! As a token of my appreciation,</b>

02:38.120 --> 02:39.760
<b>I'll give you some advice.</b>

02:39.760 --> 02:41.200
<b>Advice?</b>

02:41.200 --> 02:46.370
<b>Look. See that big cedar tree on the hilltop?</b>

02:46.370 --> 02:47.390
<b>Uh-huh.</b>

02:47.390 --> 02:49.930
<b>You should make your way there first.</b>

02:49.930 --> 02:52.270
<b>It's a shortcut to the exam site.</b>

02:52.270 --> 02:53.520
<b>A shortcut?</b>

02:53.520 --> 02:54.530
<b>Got it!</b>

02:54.530 --> 02:56.280
<b>So, I just need to head for that tree!</b>

02:56.280 --> 02:58.090
<b>I'll do that, Captain!</b>

02:58.090 --> 02:59.280
<b>Thanks!</b>

02:59.280 --> 03:00.780
<b>Best of luck!</b>

03:00.780 --> 03:03.020

03:16.750 --> 03:19.320

03:19.320 --> 03:20.310
<b>Why?</b>

03:20.310 --> 03:23.680
<b>According to the notice I received,</b>

03:23.680 --> 03:27.510
<b>the exam is supposedly being held 
somewhere in Zaban City.</b>

03:28.450 --> 03:30.020
<b>Right now, we're here.</b>

03:30.020 --> 03:34.020
<b>That tree is in the opposite direction.</b>

03:34.020 --> 03:36.190
<b>Perhaps you misheard him?</b>

03:36.190 --> 03:40.080
<b>No, he told me to head toward that cedar tree.</b>

03:40.080 --> 03:41.400
<b>I see...</b>

03:41.400 --> 03:44.940
<b>And this notice isn't any help!</b>

03:44.940 --> 03:49.040
<b>Where, exactly, in Zaban City 
are we meant to go?</b>

03:49.040 --> 03:53.140
<b>Our task is to find the exam site, 
using a limited amount of information.</b>

03:53.140 --> 03:56.240
<b>Just another test before we'll be allowed 
to take the Hunter Exam.</b>

03:56.240 --> 03:58.590
<b>I-I knew that...</b>

03:58.590 --> 03:59.800
<b>I already knew that!</b>

03:59.800 --> 04:02.230
<b>Anyway, I'll go have a look.</b>

04:02.230 --> 04:04.430
<b>The captain must have had 
a reason to suggest that.</b>

04:04.430 --> 04:05.410
<b>Hey, hey...</b>

04:05.410 --> 04:06.300
<b>You're serious?</b>

04:06.830 --> 04:09.520
<b>The bus to Zaban is about to leave.</b>

04:09.520 --> 04:11.290
<b>We should just take it.</b>

04:12.000 --> 04:13.440
<b>Hey!</b>

04:13.440 --> 04:15.180
<b>Man...</b>

04:15.180 --> 04:19.430
<b>He's gotta learn that you 
can't trust everyone.</b>

04:19.430 --> 04:20.410
<b>Huh?</b>

04:20.410 --> 04:21.260
<b>Hey!</b>

04:21.260 --> 04:22.190
<b>Kurapika!</b>

04:22.190 --> 04:26.950
<b>Gon's behavior interests me more 
than the captain's advice.</b>

04:27.360 --> 04:29.710
<b>I'm going with him.</b>

04:29.710 --> 04:31.430
<b>Oh, is that so?</b>

04:31.430 --> 04:32.490
<b>See ya.</b>

04:32.490 --> 04:34.960
<b>Wasn't very long... Nice knowing you.</b>

04:35.930 --> 04:38.710
<b>Guess he's not as independent as I'd thought...</b>

04:38.710 --> 04:41.070
<b>I'm just gonna take the bus!</b>

04:41.070 --> 04:42.590
<b>So it was a trap...</b>

04:43.840 --> 04:47.350
<b>Seems none of the buses have 
made it to Zaban City.</b>

04:48.040 --> 04:52.510
<b>Rookies usually fail this part 
because they're too na√Øve.</b>

04:53.930 --> 04:55.100
<b>Wait, wait, wait!</b>

04:55.100 --> 04:56.850
<b>Wait for me!</b>

05:01.390 --> 05:04.120
<b>Well, I knew you guys would 
be lonely without me.</b>

05:04.120 --> 05:06.260
<b>And it's no fun traveling alone.</b>

05:06.820 --> 05:10.090
<b>So I decided to stick with you 
guys a while longer.</b>

05:19.290 --> 05:21.990
<b>This is a creepy place...</b>

05:21.990 --> 05:24.050
<b>I don't see a single person.</b>

05:24.050 --> 05:26.910
<b>No, there are plenty here.</b>

05:26.910 --> 05:28.300
<b>What?</b>

05:41.940 --> 05:44.940
<b>Wh-What's with the freak show?</b>

05:45.790 --> 05:47.450
<b>Exciting...</b>

05:47.450 --> 05:49.450
<b>E-Exciting?</b>

05:50.200 --> 05:51.950
<b>Exciting...</b>

05:51.950 --> 05:53.110
<b>Exciting.</b>

05:55.780 --> 05:58.960
<b>Exciting two-choice quiz!</b>

06:07.210 --> 06:11.470
<b>You boys are headed for that 
tree on the hill, correct?</b>

06:11.930 --> 06:13.910
<b>To reach that tree,</b>

06:13.910 --> 06:17.110
<b>you must pass through this town.</b>

06:17.110 --> 06:17.980
<b>Huh?</b>

06:17.980 --> 06:21.410
<b>I shall administer a single-question quiz.</b>

06:21.410 --> 06:22.680
<b>H-Hold on!</b>

06:22.680 --> 06:24.270
<b>What's going on here?</b>

06:24.270 --> 06:26.740
<b>You'll have five seconds to state your answer.</b>

06:26.740 --> 06:29.610
<b>Give the wrong answer, and you're disqualified.</b>

06:29.610 --> 06:32.740
<b>You'll have to give up on taking 
this year's Hunter Exam.</b>

06:32.740 --> 06:34.360
<b>I see...</b>

06:34.360 --> 06:37.570
<b>Then this is part of the Hunter Exam.</b>

06:37.570 --> 06:39.220
<b>I see how it is.</b>

06:39.220 --> 06:41.110
<b>I happen to be a quiz expert.</b>

06:41.110 --> 06:42.500
<b>Wait. Only one question?</b>

06:42.500 --> 06:45.770
<b>Your answer will be either the number 1 or 2.</b>

06:45.770 --> 06:50.010
<b>Any other answer will be considered incorrect.</b>

06:50.440 --> 06:51.780
<b>Hold on!</b>

06:51.780 --> 06:53.860
<b>All three of us share one question?</b>

06:53.860 --> 06:57.270
<b>So if one of them answers incorrectly, 
I'm disqualified, too?</b>

06:57.270 --> 06:59.110
<b>As if that would happen!</b>

06:59.110 --> 07:02.550
<b>What scares me is the high likelihood 
of the vice versa happening.</b>

07:02.550 --> 07:03.590
<b>What was that?</b>

07:03.590 --> 07:04.590
<b>But you know...</b>

07:04.590 --> 07:08.770
<b>This way's easier, since only one of us 
needs to know the answer.</b>

07:08.770 --> 07:10.880
<b>I'm not good at quizzes.</b>

07:10.880 --> 07:11.590
<b>I suppose...</b>

07:11.590 --> 07:12.460
<b>Fair point.</b>

07:12.460 --> 07:15.660
<b>Hey, there. Hurry it up.</b>

07:15.660 --> 07:18.450
<b>Or else I'll answer the question first.</b>

07:18.830 --> 07:19.990
<b>Who are you?</b>

07:19.990 --> 07:23.880
<b>He followed us here, all the way from port.</b>

07:23.880 --> 07:25.460
<b>Huh? Seriously?</b>

07:25.460 --> 07:27.280
<b>Sorry, kid.</b>

07:27.280 --> 07:30.720
<b>I happened to overhear your conversation.</b>

07:30.720 --> 07:32.430
<b>What will you do?</b>

07:32.430 --> 07:34.310
<b>He seems eager to take it.</b>

07:34.310 --> 07:35.760
<b>We should let him go first.</b>

07:35.760 --> 07:37.930
<b>That way, we'll know what kind 
of question to expect.</b>

07:37.930 --> 07:39.570
<b>I don't mind.</b>

07:39.570 --> 07:40.900
<b>I have no objection.</b>

07:40.900 --> 07:42.480
<b>Then I'll get to it.</b>

07:42.960 --> 07:44.020
<b><i>Fools.</i></b>

07:44.020 --> 07:48.230
<b><i>I'll leave a trail of traps behind me.</i></b>

07:48.230 --> 07:50.820
<b>Here is your question...</b>

07:51.990 --> 07:56.050
<b>Evil villains have captured your mother and lover.</b>

07:56.050 --> 07:58.400
<b>You can only save one.</b>

07:58.400 --> 08:01.500
<b>Select 1 for your mother, or 2 for your lover.</b>

08:01.500 --> 08:04.120
<b>Which will you save?</b>

08:05.130 --> 08:07.290
<b>H-How is this even a quiz?</b>

08:11.090 --> 08:12.550
<b>The answer is 1.</b>

08:12.550 --> 08:15.300
<b>Oh? Why do you say that?</b>

08:15.760 --> 08:18.990
<b>Because you can't replace your mother.</b>

08:18.990 --> 08:21.590
<b>But you can find another lover.</b>

08:21.590 --> 08:22.560
<b>What?</b>

08:26.680 --> 08:27.820
<b>You may pass.</b>

08:27.820 --> 08:29.070
<b>What?</b>

08:29.780 --> 08:33.700
<b>You just have to tell the old lady 
what she wants to hear.</b>

08:33.700 --> 08:35.200
<b>Adios.</b>

08:35.200 --> 08:37.780
<b>Hey, now! That's all bull!</b>

08:37.780 --> 08:39.950
<b>How was that the right answer?</b>

08:40.430 --> 08:42.960
<b>We're supposed to give the answer 
the old lady wants?</b>

08:43.470 --> 08:45.210
<b>And that's considered correct?</b>

08:45.900 --> 08:47.360
<b>Hey, say something!</b>

08:49.500 --> 08:52.050
<b>I won't put up with this sham.</b>

08:52.050 --> 08:53.680
<b>I'll find a different route.</b>

08:53.680 --> 08:54.830
<b>It's too late.</b>

08:55.720 --> 09:00.470
<b>Refuse to take the quiz, and you're disqualified.</b>

09:01.470 --> 09:03.080
<b>Th-That's just ridiculous!</b>

09:03.080 --> 09:05.960
<b>Different people would expect different answers!</b>

09:05.960 --> 09:09.230
<b>There is no right answer!</b>

09:10.270 --> 09:12.180
<b>No right answer...</b>

09:12.890 --> 09:13.990
<b>I see!</b>

09:15.120 --> 09:15.990
<b>Leorio!</b>

09:15.990 --> 09:16.990
<b>Wait!</b>

09:18.750 --> 09:22.490
<b><i>The cat-eyed boy has figured it out.</i></b>

09:22.490 --> 09:25.310
<b>Not another word from you.</b>

09:25.400 --> 09:27.340
<b>Say anything but the answer,</b>

09:27.340 --> 09:29.000
<b>and you're immediately disqualified.</b>

09:30.750 --> 09:32.520
<b><i>Wake up, Leorio...</i></b>

09:32.520 --> 09:34.780
<b><i>It's a simple trick...</i></b>

09:36.150 --> 09:37.010
<b><i>Gon...</i></b>

09:37.510 --> 09:39.230
<b>Here is your question...</b>

09:41.260 --> 09:44.800
<b>Your son and daughter have been kidnapped.</b>

09:44.800 --> 09:47.610
<b>You can only rescue one.</b>

09:47.610 --> 09:50.770
<b>Select 1 for your son, or 2 for your daughter.</b>

09:50.770 --> 09:53.500
<b>Which will you rescue?</b>

09:53.880 --> 09:56.030
<b><i>She's making fun of us...</i></b>

09:57.530 --> 09:58.470
<b>Five.</b>

10:00.660 --> 10:03.160
<b><i>Go ahead and count down, you hag.</i></b>

10:01.050 --> 10:02.270
<b>Four.</b>

10:03.740 --> 10:05.130
<b>Three.</b>

10:06.950 --> 10:08.170
<b>Two.</b>

10:10.070 --> 10:11.210
<b>One.</b>

10:14.630 --> 10:16.750
<b>Buzz. Time's up.</b>

10:27.230 --> 10:29.020
<b>Don't stop me, Kurapika!</b>

10:29.020 --> 10:32.690
<b>I won't be satisfied until I've 
taught this hag a lesson!</b>

10:32.690 --> 10:34.190
<b>Calm down, Leorio!</b>

10:34.190 --> 10:36.880
<b>How am I supposed to calm down?</b>

10:36.880 --> 10:39.490
<b>You'll waste our correct response.</b>

10:40.640 --> 10:42.240
<b>Correct response?</b>

10:42.240 --> 10:44.930
<b>We gave the right answer.</b>

10:44.930 --> 10:48.000
<b>Silence was the correct response.</b>

10:48.000 --> 10:50.530
<b>Silence? What do you mean...</b>

10:50.530 --> 10:53.240
<b>You hit the nail on the head.</b>

10:54.140 --> 10:57.760
<b><i>There is no right answer!</i></b>

10:57.760 --> 10:58.810
<b>Precisely.</b>

10:58.810 --> 11:01.040
<b>This quiz had no right answer.</b>

11:01.040 --> 11:04.390
<b>However, we could only state 
1 or 2 as the answer.</b>

11:04.390 --> 11:07.070
<b>In other words, we weren't meant 
to respond at all.</b>

11:07.070 --> 11:08.770
<b>Silence was the only response.</b>

11:08.770 --> 11:10.840
<b>But what about that other guy?</b>

11:10.840 --> 11:14.600
<b>They never said he gave the right answer. 
She only said, "You may pass."</b>

11:14.600 --> 11:18.280
<b>In other words, this path is the wrong path.</b>

11:18.280 --> 11:19.460
<b>Am I right?</b>

11:21.160 --> 11:23.250
<b>Precisely.</b>

11:24.280 --> 11:26.960
<b>The correct path is over here.</b>

11:28.000 --> 11:29.530
<b>This leads directly to the tree.</b>

11:29.530 --> 11:32.290
<b>Walk two hours, and you'll reach the top.</b>

11:33.040 --> 11:36.290
<b>Oh, so that's what this was about...</b>

11:36.290 --> 11:40.430
<b>A couple lives in the cabin beneath that tree.</b>

11:40.430 --> 11:42.050
<b>They serve as Navigators.</b>

11:42.660 --> 11:48.060
<b>If you meet their standards, I believe that 
they will guide you to the exam site.</b>

11:50.600 --> 11:53.900
<b>Gran, I'm sorry for my rudeness.</b>

11:53.900 --> 11:56.190
<b>Don't be. I don't mind.</b>

11:56.190 --> 12:00.610
<b>I do this job because I enjoy 
meeting people like you.</b>

12:00.610 --> 12:01.700
<b>Huh?</b>

12:03.440 --> 12:06.950
<b>Do your best to become a good Hunter.</b>

12:15.730 --> 12:19.210
<b>It's no use. I can't think of an answer.</b>

12:21.880 --> 12:24.680
<b>You were still trying to find an answer?</b>

12:24.680 --> 12:25.700
<b>You can stop.</b>

12:25.700 --> 12:27.360
<b>Huh? Why?</b>

12:27.360 --> 12:29.440
<b>The quiz is over.</b>

12:29.440 --> 12:31.260
<b>I know.</b>

12:31.260 --> 12:31.980
<b>But...</b>

12:31.980 --> 12:33.580
<b>But you know...</b>

12:33.580 --> 12:36.490
<b>What if I run into a situation like that</b>

12:36.490 --> 12:40.040
<b>and I can only save one person...</b>

12:40.040 --> 12:41.490
<b>What should I do then?</b>

12:42.710 --> 12:45.490
<b>It wouldn't be right to choose just one...</b>

12:45.490 --> 12:51.250
<b>But one day, I might have 
to make that choice.</b>

12:57.380 --> 12:58.640
<b><i>That's right.</i></b>

12:58.640 --> 13:02.460
<b><i>That is the true purpose of this test.</i></b>

13:03.210 --> 13:06.720
<b><i>You must be prepared to face the 
worst possible scenarios...</i></b>

13:06.720 --> 13:11.590
<b><i>Because harsh reality strikes without warning.</i></b>

13:11.590 --> 13:15.880

<b>Kurapika</b>

13:28.360 --> 13:30.740
<b>It's totally dark out...</b>

13:30.740 --> 13:33.260
<b>"Walk two hours," she said?</b>

13:33.260 --> 13:35.650
<b>It was two hours, two hours ago!</b>

13:35.650 --> 13:36.750
<b>Damn.</b>

13:37.400 --> 13:39.750
<b>Beware of Magical Beasts!</b>

13:39.750 --> 13:43.160
<b>Another "Beware of Magical Beasts" sign?</b>

13:43.160 --> 13:46.630
<b>Are we ever gonna make it to the exam site?</b>

13:46.630 --> 13:48.540
<b>I'm hungry!</b>

13:48.540 --> 13:50.260
<b>I need to take a dump!</b>

13:49.240 --> 13:50.260
<b>Leorio!</b>

13:50.260 --> 13:51.640
<b>We'll leave you behind!</b>

13:50.260 --> 13:52.490
<b>I've gotta take a leak, too!</b>

13:52.490 --> 13:53.280
<b>I see it.</b>

13:53.280 --> 13:53.890
<b>Hey!</b>

14:00.680 --> 14:02.900
<b>Hello? Anyone home?</b>

14:02.900 --> 14:04.260
<b>Are they out?</b>

14:06.740 --> 14:07.970
<b>We're coming in.</b>

14:15.790 --> 14:16.980
<b>It's a Magical Beast!</b>

14:16.980 --> 14:17.790
<b>A Magical Beast?</b>

14:17.790 --> 14:19.720
<b>A Transforming Magical Beast, the Kiriko!</b>

14:19.720 --> 14:21.290
<b>They can take human form!</b>

14:21.290 --> 14:23.550
<b>That's an extremely intelligent creature!</b>

14:23.550 --> 14:25.220
<b>There's a woman in his arms!</b>

14:25.220 --> 14:27.510
<b>And the guy on the floor 
needs medical attention...</b>

14:32.490 --> 14:33.600
<b>P-Please...</b>

14:33.600 --> 14:36.140
<b>Please save my wife...</b>

14:36.850 --> 14:38.740
<b>Leorio, we'll leave the injured man to you!</b>

14:38.740 --> 14:39.900
<b>Got it!</b>

14:48.470 --> 14:53.120
<b><i>He can follow that faint shadow, 
even through this dark forest.</i></b>

14:57.420 --> 14:59.040
<b><i>Impressive.</i></b>

15:01.880 --> 15:03.880
<b>Kiriko! Let her go!</b>

15:05.020 --> 15:06.860
<b>Take her from me, if you can!</b>

15:10.600 --> 15:13.070
<b>Wow! He can talk!</b>

15:13.070 --> 15:16.240
<b>That Magical Beast, 
the Kiriko, uses human speech.</b>

15:16.240 --> 15:19.320
<b>Oh. That makes this a lot easier!</b>

15:22.100 --> 15:24.110
<b>Hey! Silly Kiriko!</b>

15:24.110 --> 15:24.980
<b>What?</b>

15:26.610 --> 15:28.360
<b><i>H-He's fast!</i></b>

15:30.990 --> 15:32.070
<b>Kurapika!</b>

15:36.580 --> 15:38.200
<b>He's so reckless...</b>

15:38.870 --> 15:40.120
<b>Stupid kid.</b>

15:40.120 --> 15:41.410
<b>You'll pay for this!</b>

15:41.410 --> 15:42.210
<b>Wait!</b>

15:48.460 --> 15:49.880
<b>Are you okay?</b>

15:49.880 --> 15:51.970
<b>Are you injured anywhere?</b>

15:51.970 --> 15:53.440
<b>I'm okay.</b>

15:53.440 --> 15:54.880
<b>What about my husband?</b>

15:54.880 --> 15:55.970
<b>How is he?</b>

15:55.970 --> 15:57.420
<b>Don't worry.</b>

15:57.420 --> 15:59.230
<b>Our friend is taking care of him.</b>

15:59.230 --> 16:01.980
<b>Please take me to my husband!</b>

16:03.570 --> 16:04.730
<b>Those tattoos...</b>

16:08.230 --> 16:09.870
<b>You're...</b>

16:09.870 --> 16:10.780
<b>Kurapika!</b>

16:11.740 --> 16:12.960
<b>You okay?</b>

16:12.960 --> 16:13.990
<b>Leorio?</b>

16:13.990 --> 16:16.850
<b>Whew... Guess you guys are all right.</b>

16:16.850 --> 16:18.740
<b>How is that man?</b>

16:18.740 --> 16:21.310
<b>Yeah, no worries.</b>

16:21.310 --> 16:24.110
<b>The wound wasn't as deep as it looked.</b>

16:24.110 --> 16:27.780
<b>I gave him some painkillers, 
and he's sound asleep in the cabin.</b>

16:27.780 --> 16:28.710
<b>I see...</b>

16:37.880 --> 16:39.260
<b>How did you know?</b>

16:41.270 --> 16:45.230
<b>How did you know I was an impostor?</b>

16:47.470 --> 16:50.540
<b>I didn't think that you were.</b>

16:50.540 --> 16:55.160
<b>I told Leorio to take care of the 
injured man, and he consented.</b>

16:55.860 --> 16:58.980
<b>Given the Magical Beast is still on the loose,</b>

16:58.980 --> 17:04.670
<b>I attacked you for foolishly leaving 
an injured man on his own.</b>

17:04.670 --> 17:06.170
<b>That's all.</b>

17:09.810 --> 17:12.670
<b>Now I need you to answer my question.</b>

17:13.210 --> 17:15.480
<b>Who are you?</b>

17:24.530 --> 17:25.690
<b>Wait!</b>

17:47.640 --> 17:49.590
<b>For a kid, you're pretty quick.</b>

17:50.210 --> 17:53.090
<b>Didn't expect you'd land a blow on me.</b>

17:58.660 --> 18:00.390
<b>You're about to discover</b>

18:00.390 --> 18:05.880
<b>the high price that accomplishment came with!</b>

18:14.110 --> 18:15.740
<b>Who are you?</b>

18:20.210 --> 18:23.240
<b>You aren't the one I hit.</b>

18:23.240 --> 18:25.750
<b>Are you his friend?</b>

18:26.950 --> 18:31.250
<b>How can you tell that I'm not the same one?</b>

18:31.250 --> 18:32.400
<b>Huh?</b>

18:32.400 --> 18:34.510
<b>Your face is completely different.</b>

18:34.510 --> 18:38.690
<b>And your voice is a little higher and thinner.</b>

18:45.080 --> 18:45.840
<b>What?</b>

18:45.840 --> 18:47.620
<b>Did I say something funny?</b>

18:48.920 --> 18:50.610
<b>Hey, sweetheart!</b>

18:50.610 --> 18:51.640
<b>Come out here!</b>

18:51.640 --> 18:53.740
<b>You're gonna love this!</b>

18:54.980 --> 18:56.530
<b>Hmm...</b>

18:56.530 --> 19:01.380
<b>How many years has it been since someone 
was able to tell us apart?</b>

19:01.380 --> 19:02.780
<b>I'm ecstatic!</b>

19:02.780 --> 19:05.830
<b>Can you tell their faces and 
voices are different?</b>

19:05.830 --> 19:07.290
<b>No, not at all...</b>

19:07.290 --> 19:11.800
<b>You see, the one Kurapika and I 
beat up is the husband.</b>

19:11.800 --> 19:14.290
<b>Which one are you talking about?</b>

19:14.290 --> 19:16.800
<b>Allow us to introduce ourselves.</b>

19:17.260 --> 19:19.190
<b>We are the Navigators.</b>

19:19.190 --> 19:21.980
<b>Our family provides support 
for the Hunter Exam.</b>

19:21.980 --> 19:23.260
<b>I'm their daughter!</b>

19:23.260 --> 19:24.300
<b>I'm their son!</b>

19:24.300 --> 19:27.330
<b>Man, you had us fooled.</b>

19:27.330 --> 19:30.480
<b>The Hunter Exam changes site every year.</b>

19:30.480 --> 19:34.380
<b>It's quite difficult to locate it.</b>

19:34.380 --> 19:39.600
<b>So we Navigators help by guiding 
the applicants to the site.</b>

19:39.600 --> 19:41.570
<b>Oh, that's how it works.</b>

19:41.570 --> 19:45.330
<b>But we don't help every candidate.</b>

19:45.330 --> 19:49.300
<b>We test applicants to see if they're qualified</b>

19:49.300 --> 19:52.080
<b>to take the exam.</b>

19:52.080 --> 19:53.590
<b>Kurapika-dono.</b>

19:53.590 --> 19:54.840
<b>Yes.</b>

19:54.840 --> 19:58.990
<b>You successfully used the most vague of hints</b>

19:58.990 --> 20:02.860
<b>to determine that we weren't spouses.</b>

20:02.860 --> 20:07.010
<b>The hint was these tattoos 
which, in this region,</b>

20:07.010 --> 20:10.600
<b>mark a woman as single for life.</b>

20:10.600 --> 20:14.580
<b>Kurapika-dono demonstrated that 
he is very knowledgeable.</b>

20:14.860 --> 20:17.260
<b>Therefore, he passes.</b>

20:18.330 --> 20:20.130
<b>Way to go, Kurapika.</b>

20:20.130 --> 20:20.940
<b>Thanks.</b>

20:20.940 --> 20:22.380
<b>Leorio-dono.</b>

20:22.380 --> 20:23.320
<b>Yeah...</b>

20:23.320 --> 20:27.580
<b>You never realized my true identity.</b>

20:28.760 --> 20:30.630
<b>However, you dressed my injuries</b>

20:30.630 --> 20:33.020
<b>faster and more thoroughly than any doctor.</b>

20:33.020 --> 20:37.250
<b>Most importantly, you continued 
to reassure me</b>

20:37.250 --> 20:41.010
<b>that my wife was safe.</b>

20:41.010 --> 20:42.690
<b>S-Stop it...</b>

20:42.690 --> 20:43.830
<b>It's embarrassing...</b>

20:44.360 --> 20:48.850
<b>Your kindness makes you worthy 
to take the Hunter Exam.</b>

20:49.630 --> 20:51.350
<b>Thus, you pass.</b>

20:51.350 --> 20:52.970
<b>R-Really?</b>

20:53.550 --> 20:56.560
<b>Thank goodness...</b>

20:56.560 --> 20:57.780
<b>You did it!</b>

21:00.170 --> 21:02.370
<b>And finally, Gon-dono.</b>

21:02.370 --> 21:03.240
<b>Yes!</b>

21:03.860 --> 21:08.740
<b>Your superhuman physical ability 
and powers of observation</b>

21:09.280 --> 21:12.500
<b>make you worthy to take the Hunter Exam.</b>

21:13.520 --> 21:14.750
<b>You pass.</b>

21:22.580 --> 21:26.800
<b>We will now take you to the exam site.</b>

21:27.890 --> 21:31.020
<b>Isn't it great that we all passed?</b>

21:31.020 --> 21:32.880
<b>It's too early to celebrate.</b>

21:32.880 --> 21:35.380
<b>We've merely earned the right 
to take the real exam.</b>

21:35.380 --> 21:36.950
<b>What's wrong with celebrating a little?</b>

21:36.950 --> 21:39.330
<b>We're making progress.</b>

21:39.330 --> 21:42.170
<b>Honestly, you people really should think.</b>

21:42.170 --> 21:44.780
<b>Hey! Why must you be such a smart-ass?</b>

21:44.780 --> 21:46.670
<b>Stop moving around!</b>

21:46.670 --> 21:48.780
<b>If you fall, blame yourself!</b>

21:50.020 --> 21:54.270
<b>Gon and his friends enjoy a brief 
journey through the sky.</b>

21:54.270 --> 21:59.990
<b>However, they still haven't reached 
the starting line.</b>

23:30.380 --> 23:32.620
<b>Next time: Rivals x For x Survival.</b>

23:32.620 --> 23:34.100
<b>I'm going to do my best!</b>
