WEBVTT

00:11.312 --> 00:15.100
- Have you got your eye on anyone?
- Not really.

00:15.272 --> 00:17.866
Actually, I was talking to the mouse,

00:18.032 --> 00:21.547
but now you mention it,
some of those Thosian women are hot.

00:21.712 --> 00:25.751
We did just save them from the Wraith,
so we gotta trade on that.

00:25.912 --> 00:27.948
Sit down. I'm ready.

00:32.552 --> 00:35.112
I'm surprised you're so eager to volunteer.

00:35.272 --> 00:38.981
- You know me, always eager to help.
- Right.

00:39.152 --> 00:42.747
Any questions about the process?
I mean, you are a scientist.

00:42.912 --> 00:47.906
Yeah. I'm sorry. Medicine is
about as much of a science as voodoo.

00:49.632 --> 00:53.944
I need it to enable me to use Ancient
technology like Major Sheppard or you.

00:54.112 --> 00:57.104
Yes, hopefully.
You are the first human trial.

00:57.832 --> 01:02.030
Why now? We knew we'd need as many
people with the gene as we could get.

01:02.192 --> 01:06.265
Without proper FDA approval
it was virtually impossible on Earth...

01:07.112 --> 01:09.990
Let's just say
it's legal in the Pegasus galaxy.

01:10.152 --> 01:13.349
- And completely safe?
- As far as gene therapy goes.

01:15.112 --> 01:18.866
- I am manipulating your DNA. Here we go.
- Tell me more.

01:19.032 --> 01:24.709
We believe Ancient Technology Activation
is caused by one gene that's always on,

01:24.872 --> 01:29.309
instructing various cells to produce
a series of proteins and enzymes

01:29.472 --> 01:32.669
that interact with the skin,
the nervous system and the brain.

01:32.832 --> 01:36.427
We're using a mouse retrovirus
to deliver the missing gene.

01:36.592 --> 01:39.186
- A mouse retrovirus?
- It's been deactivated.

01:39.352 --> 01:43.186
- Are there any side effects?
- Dry mouth, headache.

01:43.352 --> 01:46.867
- The urge to run on a small wheel.
- That's very amusing.

01:47.032 --> 01:50.422
- How long till it starts working?
- Some time. What is that?

01:50.592 --> 01:53.311
Something I found
in one of the research labs.

01:53.472 --> 01:56.464
Something the Ancients
were experimenting with.

01:56.632 --> 02:00.625
- Do you know what it is?
- Uh... pretty sure.

02:01.432 --> 02:05.141
It's desalinising the sea water
and storing it for the whole city.

02:05.312 --> 02:07.303
Fresh water won't be a problem.

02:07.472 --> 02:10.350
Some Ancient technology
requires users to have the gene.

02:10.512 --> 02:15.745
Other things require initialisation. Once
activated, anyone can make them work.

02:15.912 --> 02:19.461
- Good morning, Dr Weir.
- Morning. Careful.

02:19.632 --> 02:23.022
- We need to designate recreational areas.
- Yes.

02:23.192 --> 02:26.787
We need to clear the hallway
as soon as possible.

02:26.952 --> 02:29.910
Can we lose
the 10,000-year-old dead plants?

02:30.072 --> 02:34.145
Of course. We're still making sure
everyone has living quarters.

02:34.312 --> 02:36.587
Major Sheppard
seems to be taking his time.

02:36.752 --> 02:39.664
- The safety and security...
- I'm ready.

02:42.112 --> 02:43.784
Oh, my God.

02:43.952 --> 02:45.908
- Did you see that?
- Yes. What the...?

02:46.632 --> 02:48.463
I'm fine.

02:52.912 --> 02:55.142
Look. Beckett's gene therapy worked.

02:55.312 --> 02:58.509
I activated this personal shield.
Acts like a protective skin.

02:58.672 --> 03:02.665
It must have inertial-dampening
properties too. Watch this.

03:02.832 --> 03:06.620
- Hit me.
- Ow! God!

03:06.792 --> 03:10.580
You didn't have to swing so hard.
Notice he didn't even hesitate.

03:10.752 --> 03:15.701
Why did you test this device by
having someone throw you off a balcony?

03:15.872 --> 03:17.863
That's not the first thing we tried.

03:18.832 --> 03:20.902
I shot him.

03:21.072 --> 03:22.744
In the leg.

03:23.392 --> 03:25.064
I'm invulnerable.

03:25.232 --> 03:30.306
Don't you always say how proper
scientific procedure must be adhered to?

03:30.472 --> 03:34.465
- Invulnerable.
- Take it off. Let's go have this meeting.

03:34.632 --> 03:37.385
- You're just jealous.
- Yes, green with envy.

03:40.312 --> 03:42.428
This could be a problem.

03:43.392 --> 03:45.781
I can't get at it.

03:52.792 --> 03:54.783
Just checking.

03:56.000 --> 04:02.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:00.072 --> 05:03.621
- I'm thinking Mr Invincible.
- Captain Untouchable.

05:03.792 --> 05:06.226
- That's good.
- You guys done?

05:06.392 --> 05:08.622
I've been working on this for months.

05:08.792 --> 05:12.831
Forgive me for wanting to celebrate
the fact that it worked first time.

05:12.992 --> 05:14.425
Let's have a toast.

05:17.792 --> 05:22.308
Just a thought, but have you tried
eating or drinking since you put that on?

05:39.832 --> 05:41.265
That's great.

05:42.792 --> 05:45.067
This may be more serious
than I suspected.

05:45.232 --> 05:49.191
I'm hungry. What am I gonna do?
I'll be dead by the end of the day.

05:49.352 --> 05:52.549
- You can live for days without water.
- I'm talking about food.

05:52.712 --> 05:55.749
What did the Ancient texts say
about taking it off?

05:55.912 --> 05:58.380
There were instructions
which I chose to ignore.

05:58.552 --> 06:01.544
Some Ancient technology
uses a mental component.

06:01.712 --> 06:04.510
Shut up. I'm thinking.

06:08.232 --> 06:11.542
Is there any chance
that the gene therapy isn't permanent?

06:11.712 --> 06:14.863
- It's possible.
- I'm a dead man.

06:15.032 --> 06:19.025
We can probably maintain security
in this area with our limited personnel.

06:19.192 --> 06:21.581
- My people can help.
- Thank you, Teyla.

06:21.752 --> 06:24.550
We'll find other ways
the Athosians can contribute.

06:25.152 --> 06:28.189
- You do not trust us?
- It's not that, it's just that...

06:28.352 --> 06:31.424
..we need to train your people
in our weapons and tactics.

06:31.592 --> 06:35.983
- You invited me to be in your team.
- We value your knowledge and expertise.

06:36.152 --> 06:38.143
As we value all the Athosians.

06:38.312 --> 06:42.510
For now there should be more
than enough living space for everyone.

06:42.672 --> 06:44.867
We have lived
in the shadow of the Wraith,

06:45.032 --> 06:48.183
but my people have never been
in a place such as this.

06:48.352 --> 06:52.664
They are afraid. Some believe
the ghosts of the Ancestors remain.

06:52.832 --> 06:57.860
I don't think so, but we're gonna need
more time to explore the entire city.

06:58.032 --> 07:01.661
We're very cautious
intergalactic explorers.

07:01.832 --> 07:04.869
We don't want anyone else getting hurt
the way Halling did.

07:05.032 --> 07:09.867
No one must touch anything unfamiliar
unless it's been cleared first.

07:10.032 --> 07:15.743
It's very important. Even a tiny little
innocuous thing can... kill you.

07:17.632 --> 07:20.305
Dead man talking.

07:23.032 --> 07:26.024
- Carson.
- Dr Weir.

07:26.792 --> 07:31.183
Grodin's team's going through the Ancient
research material with the shield device,

07:31.352 --> 07:35.504
but McKay didn't find anything helpful
and he is the smartest guy here.

07:35.672 --> 07:37.742
So he likes to tell us.

07:37.912 --> 07:40.665
Listen. I feel terrible.

07:40.832 --> 07:43.949
It may have been a result
of artificially imposing the gene.

07:44.112 --> 07:46.228
I have another theory.

07:46.392 --> 07:50.021
We know there is a mental component
to using Ancient technology.

07:50.192 --> 07:54.390
I experienced it first hand
with that drone weapon back on Earth.

07:54.552 --> 07:59.831
Exactly. Don't you think McKay should be
able to shut this thing off with his mind?

07:59.992 --> 08:02.222
Are you suggesting he doesn't want to?

08:02.392 --> 08:06.146
We may be settling in here,
but this place is still pretty intimidating.

08:06.312 --> 08:10.544
A giant abandoned city full of things
way beyond our level of understanding.

08:10.712 --> 08:12.987
Impending threat of attack from the Wraith.

08:13.152 --> 08:15.871
No question.
It gets bloody creepy here at night.

08:16.032 --> 08:20.389
I'm not saying it's conscious,
but perhaps subconsciously...

08:20.552 --> 08:22.747
I don't think he wants to die
of dehydration.

08:22.912 --> 08:25.824
No, neither do I, but he's not there yet.

08:26.992 --> 08:30.143
You think the shield
will just shut itself down?

08:30.312 --> 08:34.464
The Ancients were smart enough to build
fail safes into their other technology.

08:34.631 --> 08:38.750
This entire city rose from the deep
of the ocean when danger was imminent.

08:38.912 --> 08:41.823
Why design a personal shield
that could kill you?

08:41.991 --> 08:45.143
I certainly hope you're right.
For Rodney's sake.

08:50.392 --> 08:53.111
The self-destruct system
requires two separate codes.

08:53.272 --> 08:56.344
Each code is unique
and everyone must memorise their code.

08:56.512 --> 08:59.185
Don't bother giving me one. Sorry.

08:59.352 --> 09:03.903
This is the only Stargate in the Pegasus
galaxy capable of dialling Earth,

09:04.072 --> 09:06.506
making it the last defence
against the Wraith.

09:06.672 --> 09:10.028
If they attack,
which we must consider a very real threat,

09:10.192 --> 09:12.660
we cannot let them gain control
of this complex.

09:12.832 --> 09:17.144
If both codes are entered, the naquadah
generator will overload in 30 seconds.

09:17.312 --> 09:20.987
- Will it do enough damage?
- Ever see a 20-kiloton nuclear explosion?

09:21.152 --> 09:23.143
I have.

09:24.152 --> 09:25.710
Not up close.

09:25.872 --> 09:28.625
I think we should tell Teyla
what's going on here.

09:28.792 --> 09:33.183
We still don't know if one of the Athosians
tipped off your arrival at their planet.

09:33.352 --> 09:37.265
- I trust Teyla.
- So do I. But Teyla trusts her people.

09:37.432 --> 09:42.142
If we tell her, she'll want to tell them,
and I need more time to get to know them.

09:47.992 --> 09:51.382
Well, they thought he was finally dead,

09:52.352 --> 09:54.502
but when they turned their backs to go,

09:54.672 --> 09:57.232
his cold, dead eyes opened
beneath his hockey mask

09:57.392 --> 09:59.269
and he rose up with his knife...

09:59.432 --> 10:02.026
What's a hockey mask?

10:03.112 --> 10:08.709
Hockey's a game... Guys skate around
the ice and try to put a puck into the net.

10:12.152 --> 10:14.507
The goalies wear masks. It's really...

10:18.352 --> 10:20.388
..scary.

10:20.552 --> 10:23.020
- Tell us more of this game.
- Can we play it?

10:23.192 --> 10:25.342
I don't really see the attraction.

10:25.512 --> 10:28.390
Now, football...
Football's a real man's sport.

10:28.552 --> 10:30.429
We'll save that for another time.

10:30.592 --> 10:33.265
Yes, time for bed.

10:33.432 --> 10:39.746
Remember, tomorrow night, kids, another
tale called <i>Nightmare On Elm Street</i>.

10:40.792 --> 10:42.703
All right, children, let's go.

10:47.352 --> 10:49.343
Thank you, Major.

10:49.512 --> 10:51.946
I hope I didn't scare 'em too much.

10:52.112 --> 10:54.307
I don't think so.

10:54.472 --> 10:56.463
Good.

11:00.432 --> 11:03.230
Good night. Good night.

11:03.392 --> 11:05.383
Listen, Teyla.

11:06.152 --> 11:10.031
Don't tell McKay what I said
about hockey not being a real man's sport,

11:10.192 --> 11:13.070
'cause it's a Canadian thing,
they're touchy about it.

11:13.232 --> 11:18.431
I'm interested in hearing more about
this football you say you love so much.

11:18.592 --> 11:21.311
I can do one better. Come here.

11:24.672 --> 11:29.268
Father? Do you think we are safe here
from the Wraith?

11:32.392 --> 11:38.024
I think there's nothing certain in life...
except my love for you.

11:42.952 --> 11:45.785
- Do you miss the wind?
- Yes.

11:45.952 --> 11:48.671
But if you're very quiet
you can hear the ocean.

11:51.392 --> 11:56.261
- Do the ghosts of the Ancestors live here?
- Jinto. Go to sleep.

12:03.072 --> 12:06.826
- Funny.
- Here it comes. Watch this.

12:06.992 --> 12:12.271
<i>Flutie is back. Four seconds,</i>
<i>three seconds, two seconds, one.</i>

12:12.432 --> 12:16.710
<i>Flutie throws. This game is over.</i>
<i>Hail Mary. It is caught!</i>

12:16.872 --> 12:19.989
Oh! That is beautiful!
Can you believe that?

12:20.152 --> 12:21.631
Should I not?

12:21.792 --> 12:26.627
The defence didn't think
the quarterback could throw that far.

12:26.792 --> 12:28.384
They seem very happy.

12:28.552 --> 12:31.703
They won one of the best games
of all time against all odds.

12:31.872 --> 12:34.432
- Flutie won the Heisman.
- And played in Canada.

12:34.592 --> 12:36.583
He played hockey too?

12:38.112 --> 12:39.704
What are you guys doing?

12:39.872 --> 12:43.706
Teaching Teyla how football
is the cornerstone of Western civilisation.

12:43.872 --> 12:46.386
- You didn't invite me?
- You like football?

12:46.552 --> 12:48.270
No, not really.

12:48.432 --> 12:53.870
Come on. It's real, unpredictable,
it's full of passion and... beer, hot dogs.

12:54.032 --> 12:55.351
Cheerleaders.

12:55.512 --> 12:59.664
I can't understand. You're allowed
one personal item and you chose this.

12:59.832 --> 13:06.510
It's a metaphor. This entire expedition
is the biggest Hail Mary in human history.

13:06.672 --> 13:10.426
- What is a Hail Mary?
- It's a play that you just saw.

13:10.952 --> 13:12.943
It's named after a prayer.

13:13.112 --> 13:16.661
There's this woman
and her name is Mary and she...

13:16.832 --> 13:19.300
Did I mention how much
I like Ferris wheels?

13:31.312 --> 13:33.428
Psst.

13:35.992 --> 13:39.302
- Your turn to be the Wraith.
- You can be the Wraith.

13:39.472 --> 13:42.703
- I get to be Major Sheppard.
- Ohh.

13:47.712 --> 13:51.466
One, two, three...

13:51.632 --> 13:54.908
..four, five, six...

14:07.792 --> 14:09.783
Wex?

14:37.592 --> 14:39.583
Jinto?

14:57.592 --> 14:59.787
Jinto's missing. I can't find him.

14:59.952 --> 15:03.467
I told him to be careful.
Anything he touches could be dangerous.

15:03.632 --> 15:06.385
- What if there are monsters here?
- We'll find him.

15:09.712 --> 15:12.465
Jinto's missing. Teams of two.
Floor-to-floor sweep.

15:12.632 --> 15:15.146
Start with the jumpers. Full gear.

15:15.312 --> 15:17.268
Yes, sir.

15:17.432 --> 15:20.151
- He's not in the living quarters.
- I'm with you.

15:20.312 --> 15:24.544
- You gonna be OK with that leg?
- He's my son.

15:32.072 --> 15:34.222
Can we use the sensors to locate him?

15:34.392 --> 15:36.587
Not enough power to activate the city.

15:36.752 --> 15:38.708
And the sensors don't distinguish...

15:40.552 --> 15:41.871
..individuals.

15:42.032 --> 15:44.705
There may be shielded areas
or malfunctioning sensors.

15:44.872 --> 15:48.706
We are getting a strange energy reading
in one of the unexplored areas.

15:48.872 --> 15:53.309
- Activate the communication system.
- Done.

15:53.472 --> 15:56.544
Jinto, this is Dr Weir.

15:57.472 --> 16:00.270
<i>If you can hear me, please respond.</i>

16:01.152 --> 16:03.108
<i>Jinto?</i>

16:04.872 --> 16:07.261
If you're lost, if you can't...

16:09.112 --> 16:11.831
- We've lost power.
- We've still got lights.

16:16.312 --> 16:19.509
I don't know why that happened.

16:23.592 --> 16:26.311
That wasn't me.

16:35.032 --> 16:36.863
Shut it down now.

16:40.872 --> 16:42.942
- What's going on?
- I don't know.

16:43.112 --> 16:46.946
- This hasn't happened before.
- We've only been here a few days.

16:47.112 --> 16:51.583
This stuff is pretty old.
It's that, or there really are ghosts.

17:03.952 --> 17:06.182
This is Sheppard. Lights just went out.

17:06.352 --> 17:09.105
We're experiencing
some technical malfunctions.

17:17.352 --> 17:20.627
It could be the interfaces
between our generators and the city.

17:20.791 --> 17:24.102
Or certain systems
could be causing erroneous operations.

17:24.271 --> 17:27.105
I'll run a diagnostic on the power flow.

17:27.271 --> 17:29.149
Strange that you believe in ghosts.

17:29.312 --> 17:34.432
I never used to until I learned how Wraiths
suck the life out of you with their hands.

17:35.392 --> 17:38.828
- Dr Weir?
- Teyla. I'll be right there.

17:39.752 --> 17:42.027
- Do what you can.
- Right.

17:46.072 --> 17:48.381
Dr Weir, this is Marta.

17:49.432 --> 17:52.185
Pleased to meet you.

17:52.352 --> 17:55.469
It's all right. Tell her what you saw.

17:55.632 --> 17:57.145
A shadow.

17:58.632 --> 18:03.262
The Wraith project them,
make you see things that aren't there.

18:03.432 --> 18:06.026
Are you sure?

18:06.992 --> 18:08.983
Yet I sense no Wraith here.

18:09.152 --> 18:12.667
Have you ever been wrong about that?

18:13.512 --> 18:15.309
Major, this is Weir.

18:15.472 --> 18:19.511
<i>One of the Athosians is claiming</i>
<i>to have seen what she calls a shadow.</i>

18:21.152 --> 18:23.712
She does not believe me?

18:25.472 --> 18:29.021
Teyla says she senses no Wraith here,
but I'm still concerned.

18:29.192 --> 18:32.707
All teams fall back to the gate room
and wait for instructions.

18:32.872 --> 18:37.388
- We can't stop searching.
- We need to establish a proper perimeter.

18:50.792 --> 18:53.864
I secured access to the control towers
and living quarters.

18:54.032 --> 18:55.988
Two more Athosians saw shadows.

18:56.152 --> 18:58.586
That means the Wraith would be here.

18:58.752 --> 19:02.381
- You don't think so?
- I don't think they wanna scare us.

19:02.552 --> 19:05.988
When they come, they're gonna blow
the crap out of this place.

19:06.152 --> 19:10.703
- The Athosians are just seeing things?
- Like Teyla said, it's scary for them.

19:10.872 --> 19:13.909
- Not just for them.
- Halling wishes to speak with Jinto.

19:14.072 --> 19:16.063
Please.

19:19.232 --> 19:21.223
Go ahead.

19:22.072 --> 19:23.744
Jinto.

19:25.032 --> 19:30.664
If you can hear me, I'm not angry.
I just want to know that you are safe.

19:32.432 --> 19:36.983
<i>So if you are lost or hurt,</i>
<i>stay where you are.</i>

19:37.992 --> 19:42.429
Make some noise if you can.
We will find you.

19:53.192 --> 19:55.547
- Is that Latin?
- It's Ancient.

19:55.712 --> 19:58.510
The Fathers of Light
of the Everlasting Temple?

19:58.672 --> 20:00.902
It is a prayer to the Ancestors.

20:01.072 --> 20:05.031
If you are angry that we have
unrightfully inhabited your great city,

20:05.192 --> 20:07.422
we humbly apologise.

20:07.592 --> 20:11.062
We mean no harm.

20:11.232 --> 20:13.541
We will leave if it is your wish.

20:13.712 --> 20:16.180
But I will not go without my son.

20:33.032 --> 20:35.023
- He fainted.
- Is there a better word?

20:35.192 --> 20:39.151
- Faint is the proper medical term.
- I passed out from manly hunger.

20:39.312 --> 20:41.143
Well, hang in there.

20:42.152 --> 20:45.906
Dr Weir, this is Sheppard.
McKay's OK. He... he fainted.

20:46.072 --> 20:49.951
Very sympathetic.
Let's all mock the dying man.

20:50.112 --> 20:52.990
Thank you.

22:16.032 --> 22:20.822
It didn't look like the phantoms
the Wraith make you see, but I understand.

22:20.992 --> 22:23.267
- What did it look like?
- It looked like...

22:23.432 --> 22:24.751
Darkness.

22:24.912 --> 22:28.746
It surrounded the generator and grew,
like it was feeding off the energy.

22:28.912 --> 22:33.110
When you shut it down,
the whole whatever it was went away.

22:34.472 --> 22:40.422
If it feeds on energy, we could be in big
trouble, or you could, as I won't be around.

22:40.592 --> 22:43.504
We need to figure out
what it is and what to do.

22:43.672 --> 22:46.470
- It's attracted to energy.
- Shut down the generators?

22:46.632 --> 22:48.543
People give off heat energy.

22:48.712 --> 22:51.021
It's negligible compared to a generator,

22:51.192 --> 22:53.581
but take away
the other obvious food source...

22:53.752 --> 22:56.391
- It could come after us?
- I know one thing.

22:56.552 --> 22:59.225
Flying darkness that eats energy
is very bad.

22:59.392 --> 23:01.428
OK, we keep the power on.

23:01.592 --> 23:03.708
Grodin, figure out a way to detect it.

23:03.872 --> 23:06.591
Major, establish surveillance
on all the generators.

23:06.752 --> 23:09.346
If one is targeted,
we'll shut it down remotely.

23:09.512 --> 23:13.790
Hopefully we can keep this thing busy
until we find a way to get rid of it.

23:13.952 --> 23:15.465
Everyone, this is Weir.

23:15.632 --> 23:19.466
We need you all to remain in your quarters
unless otherwise instructed.

23:19.632 --> 23:21.782
- If you see anything...
<i>- Hello?</i>

23:21.952 --> 23:24.944
<i>Can you hear me? Can anyone hear me?</i>

23:25.112 --> 23:27.342
- Jinto?
<i>- Major Sheppard!</i>

23:27.512 --> 23:29.742
- Are you OK?
<i>- I'm scared.</i>

23:29.912 --> 23:31.982
- Where are you?
<i>- I don't know.</i>

23:32.152 --> 23:35.064
Tell us how you got to where you are.

23:35.232 --> 23:38.861
<i>I was in the hall outside my quarters.</i>

23:44.152 --> 23:46.985
- Where did you go next?
<i>- I can't remember.</i>

23:47.152 --> 23:50.462
He's used to the forest,
being able to see the stars at night.

23:50.632 --> 23:53.271
<i>I found a small room</i>
<i>filled with boxes from Earth.</i>

24:03.112 --> 24:06.422
- No boxes.
<i>- They're here with me.</i>

24:06.592 --> 24:09.823
Someone thought
it would make a nice closet.

24:14.272 --> 24:16.422
It's definitely not a closet.

24:16.592 --> 24:18.822
- Did the panel glow?
<i>- Yes!</i>

24:18.992 --> 24:20.391
- Did you touch it?
<i>- Yes.</i>

24:20.552 --> 24:24.022
- What exactly?
<i>- I don't remember.</i>

24:24.192 --> 24:27.707
Before he disappeared we got
an unusual energy reading from here.

24:27.872 --> 24:29.225
Wait. No.

24:38.312 --> 24:41.702
- It must be a transporter.
- We can name it later.

24:51.232 --> 24:53.268
Major Sheppard!

24:54.272 --> 24:58.231
- Jinto! Are you OK?
- Yes.

24:58.392 --> 25:01.190
<i>We've got Jinto. He's OK.</i>

25:08.072 --> 25:12.145
- Any idea what this place is?
- A research lab. We've seen a few of them.

25:12.312 --> 25:16.942
These access the computer system,
so Jinto could have caused malfunctions.

25:17.112 --> 25:19.910
I need to know everything you touched.

25:24.112 --> 25:27.184
As far as I can tell, there's only one entity.

25:27.352 --> 25:29.820
The blue spots
are the naquadah generators.

25:29.992 --> 25:32.984
This blob is our entity.
We had to calibrate the sensors.

25:33.152 --> 25:38.943
Your idea works. I anticipate his approach
to the generators and shut them off.

25:39.112 --> 25:43.185
Here, watch. I've got it going in circles.

25:43.352 --> 25:45.547
- Good job.
- Thanks.

25:45.712 --> 25:48.146
I hope we're not making this thing mad.

25:50.512 --> 25:54.266
Lieutenant, this is Dr Grodin.
I'm tracking the entity heading your way.

25:54.432 --> 25:56.502
You might want to get out of the hall.

25:56.672 --> 25:58.742
Roger that.

26:07.432 --> 26:10.105
<i>This is Ford.</i>
<i>A bulkhead just blocked our way.</i>

26:10.272 --> 26:13.105
<i>There's no panel on the wall to open it.</i>

26:13.272 --> 26:14.830
- Roger that.
- McKay?

26:14.992 --> 26:18.189
We didn't touch anything.
The entity may be causing malfunctions.

26:18.352 --> 26:22.823
The proximity to that large a disturbance
could make the technology go haywire.

26:22.992 --> 26:26.462
Lieutenant, double back
and try the door on the east of the hall.

26:32.632 --> 26:34.782
- This door won't open.
- Here it comes.

26:34.952 --> 26:38.262
<i>Pull open the console on the wall.</i>

26:39.472 --> 26:43.226
- Hurry.
- What next?

26:43.392 --> 26:45.223
- What do you see?
- Three crystals.

26:45.392 --> 26:48.623
Take out the middle one.
Move the top one down.

26:53.232 --> 26:57.589
If this door opens, go.
I'll be right behind you.

26:59.352 --> 27:02.549
- Not working.
- Use the middle one to bridge the others.

27:02.712 --> 27:05.670
- You sure about this?
- Not exactly.

27:10.472 --> 27:12.622
Go!

27:25.752 --> 27:28.141
Man down. I need a medical team.

27:34.112 --> 27:36.706
Right, hang in there.

27:38.552 --> 27:42.830
- Are we in any danger here?
- I wish I could tell you.

27:42.992 --> 27:45.381
- How's Ford?
- Like he was hit by lightning.

27:45.552 --> 27:48.908
- He's gonna be OK?
- He's a tough kid.

27:53.632 --> 27:55.623
Sir.

27:58.792 --> 28:00.145
Hi.

28:03.832 --> 28:06.346
Tell him
there's nothing he could have done.

28:07.432 --> 28:11.505
- There is nothing you could have done.
- I could have pulled him out.

28:11.672 --> 28:15.506
- Then we'd both look like this.
- You don't look so bad.

28:15.672 --> 28:19.745
Dr Beckett says you're gonna be back
to pretty boy in no time.

28:23.752 --> 28:27.711
- Apparently it's also an elevator.
- We can stop taking the stairs.

28:27.872 --> 28:30.022
- How nice for you.
- What you got?

28:30.192 --> 28:35.391
Jinto didn't touch anything
of any consequence other than that.

28:38.712 --> 28:41.351
It must have its own power source
like the jumpers.

28:41.512 --> 28:45.585
- What is it?
- A containment vessel for the creature.

28:45.752 --> 28:48.744
- And Jinto released it?
- It seems that way.

28:48.912 --> 28:52.302
As I suggested, the entity's
been causing our technical problems.

28:52.472 --> 28:54.781
It was captured for observation.

28:54.952 --> 28:57.830
The Ancients were researching Ascension.

28:57.992 --> 29:00.904
- Really?
- What exactly is Ascension?

29:01.072 --> 29:05.304
At some point during their evolution,
the Ancients reached a stage of being,

29:05.472 --> 29:09.067
where they rid themselves of their bodies
and rose to a higher plane,

29:09.232 --> 29:12.349
one in which they live as pure energy.

29:12.512 --> 29:18.269
This is the first indication that there
may have been evolutionary intervention.

29:18.432 --> 29:20.423
Gene therapy of their own.

29:20.592 --> 29:24.790
I haven't read all the notes,
but I do know the entity is energy.

29:24.952 --> 29:26.829
It feeds on energy. Ford's lucky.

29:26.992 --> 29:31.349
The more it feeds, the bigger it gets and
the more charged and deadly it becomes.

29:31.512 --> 29:35.585
- Is it intelligent?
- According to the research, it is sentient.

29:35.752 --> 29:38.471
But you'd have more luck
talking to a shark.

29:38.632 --> 29:43.626
This thing will suck the power
out of our generators and then kill us all.

29:43.792 --> 29:45.430
What do we do about it?

29:45.592 --> 29:48.106
It's been trapped here
since the Ancients left.

29:48.272 --> 29:50.740
- I know I'd be pissed.
- And hungry.

29:50.912 --> 29:56.350
This device was designed to attract it,
capture it and hold it for observation.

29:56.512 --> 30:00.790
We may still be able to get it back inside.
I need more time to figure out how.

30:11.912 --> 30:15.507
- Hi.
- Jinto has something he wishes to say.

30:15.672 --> 30:20.587
I'm sorry.
What happened to you was my fault.

30:21.992 --> 30:25.826
Where I come from we got a little saying.
Stuff happens.

30:25.992 --> 30:30.110
It's a little different, but you
didn't mean for this to happen, did you?

30:31.592 --> 30:34.550
No. You're a good kid.

30:34.712 --> 30:38.341
You weren't doing anything wrong,
which means this isn't your fault.

30:43.272 --> 30:46.230
The same as
when we came to your planet.

30:46.392 --> 30:49.748
We didn't mean for the Wraith to show up.
That's why you're here.

30:49.912 --> 30:52.551
Your home was destroyed.
You almost lost your dad.

30:52.712 --> 30:56.910
- I don't remember you getting mad at me.
- Stuff happens.

31:10.192 --> 31:13.423
- It's not falling for the same tricks.
- How smart is it?

31:13.592 --> 31:17.107
- Rodney?
- This is much simpler than I thought.

31:17.272 --> 31:19.069
It's like a mousetrap.

31:19.232 --> 31:22.907
This button makes it emit
an energy signature to attract the creature.

31:23.072 --> 31:24.790
This one shuts it in.

31:24.952 --> 31:28.342
The only downside is that
someone has to press the buttons.

31:30.072 --> 31:32.950
- I'll do it.
- OK.

31:33.112 --> 31:35.785
Wait, Rodney.
You're still wearing the shield.

31:35.952 --> 31:39.149
If something went wrong,
would that protect you?

31:52.072 --> 31:54.108
I had a feeling.

31:54.272 --> 31:57.230
What do you mean?
Had a feeling about what?

31:58.112 --> 32:01.991
You think I wanted it to come off?
I'm not scared. I'll do this.

32:02.152 --> 32:03.983
That's OK. You might faint again.

32:04.152 --> 32:07.861
It's just not working any more.
It doesn't work on you either.

32:08.032 --> 32:10.182
I meant it wasn't gonna let you die.

32:10.352 --> 32:12.866
It is a coincidence
that it stopped working now.

32:13.032 --> 32:15.148
I need a drink.

32:15.312 --> 32:17.303
Go.

32:32.192 --> 32:35.184
You always told me
I shouldn't be afraid of the dark.

32:37.432 --> 32:39.502
I was wrong.

32:39.672 --> 32:43.665
I can't sleep now.
What if the darkness comes?

32:43.832 --> 32:45.868
It won't.

32:46.032 --> 32:48.341
How do you know?

32:48.512 --> 32:50.503
Because...

32:54.432 --> 32:56.707
..it's afraid of fire.

32:57.352 --> 32:59.183
The darkness is afraid?

33:03.032 --> 33:05.910
Everything is afraid of something.

33:32.912 --> 33:35.665
So the shield device
just came off by itself?

33:35.832 --> 33:38.141
Yeah. It just stopped working.

33:38.312 --> 33:42.908
- He even tried it on Sheppard.
- It wouldn't work on Sheppard.

33:43.072 --> 33:45.632
- Why not?
- McKay didn't tell you?

33:45.792 --> 33:48.829
The text we studied
said the shield imprints on the wearer.

33:48.992 --> 33:51.904
If we're right,
it wouldn't work on anyone else.

33:54.912 --> 33:56.948
Are we ready?

33:57.112 --> 34:01.947
You realise we're going to lose
the sensors? We won't be able to track it.

34:02.112 --> 34:04.910
We have security personnel
around the living quarters.

34:05.072 --> 34:07.222
At least we have some warning.

34:10.032 --> 34:14.264
Teyla told the Athosian children
that a candle would help protect them.

34:15.472 --> 34:18.190
- You're doing it because...
- It's gonna get dark.

34:23.431 --> 34:26.230
OK, Major. Go ahead.

34:34.752 --> 34:36.743
Now.

34:38.552 --> 34:40.907
Shutting down power.

35:02.952 --> 35:04.351
It's coming.

35:13.072 --> 35:15.142
I think we're gonna need a bigger boat.

35:15.312 --> 35:17.951
<i>- Size doesn't matter.</i>
- It's a myth.

35:18.112 --> 35:20.546
It'll fit. The device traps it in subspace.

35:20.712 --> 35:23.829
<i>Make sure it gets all the way</i>
<i>inside the containment vessel.</i>

35:27.192 --> 35:29.308
All right, come on.

35:45.032 --> 35:46.943
<i>Son of a bitch.</i>

35:47.112 --> 35:50.309
- What happened?
<i>- It took one look and went away.</i>

35:51.352 --> 35:54.310
It's a lot smarter than we thought.

35:59.952 --> 36:04.104
- We need to know where it is.
- We'll have to turn the power on.

36:04.272 --> 36:07.901
- We can't do that.
- Do it. Just the operations tower.

36:11.232 --> 36:13.871
- What now?
- It's headed this way.

36:14.032 --> 36:16.387
- You turned the power on.
- We can't go on.

36:16.552 --> 36:18.702
Do you think it wants to be here?

36:20.872 --> 36:24.990
- What do you mean?
- It's been trapped here alone.

36:25.152 --> 36:28.747
- It's not alone any more.
- It thinks about eating, that's it.

36:28.912 --> 36:31.380
- You would know.
- If we stay, it will kill us.

36:31.552 --> 36:33.782
- Unless we kill it first.
- I don't see how.

36:33.952 --> 36:36.625
Then either we must go or it must.

36:36.792 --> 36:39.181
Maybe it wants to go.

36:41.232 --> 36:44.065
If we open the Stargate...

36:49.112 --> 36:52.149
- This is a bad idea.
- You said that already.

36:52.312 --> 36:54.701
Well, it's worth saying again.

37:02.472 --> 37:03.951
It's coming.

37:04.112 --> 37:06.182
An open Stargate is a huge power source.

37:06.352 --> 37:08.741
It didn't get trapped in the Ancient vessel.

37:08.912 --> 37:11.665
Why should it follow
a naquadah generator?

37:11.832 --> 37:14.790
You got a better idea?

37:16.392 --> 37:19.907
- Good luck.
- Are you OK?

37:23.432 --> 37:25.468
It's almost here.

37:25.632 --> 37:29.625
- Do you have an address?
- M4X-337. Barren wasteland.

37:29.792 --> 37:31.783
Dial it.

37:34.792 --> 37:37.829
That was good thinking.

38:14.672 --> 38:16.469
It's not going anywhere.

38:16.632 --> 38:18.987
I can't see if the MALP got through.

38:19.152 --> 38:23.270
- It could have drained the battery.
- It could be feeding off the Stargate.

38:23.432 --> 38:26.026
Shut it down.

38:28.552 --> 38:31.146
- I can't.
- The consoles are dead.

38:33.872 --> 38:35.988
There must be something we can do.

38:36.152 --> 38:38.586
We don't know
if the MALP is still down there.

38:38.752 --> 38:43.667
The entity could go through the gate once
it's depleted the energy in the generator.

38:43.832 --> 38:46.824
Or it could continue to feed
off the gate's energy.

39:08.752 --> 39:10.390
McKay?

39:17.472 --> 39:18.791
Rodney!

40:21.312 --> 40:23.906
McKay?

40:24.072 --> 40:26.506
The power must have been drained
by the entity.

40:26.672 --> 40:28.503
Medical team to the gate room.

40:28.672 --> 40:31.027
He's not burnt. He's breathing.

40:35.432 --> 40:38.469
McKay? McKay.

40:38.632 --> 40:41.305
- Hey.
- What happened?

40:41.472 --> 40:44.862
- You did it.
- I did?

40:45.032 --> 40:46.750
It went through the gate.

40:49.552 --> 40:52.385
You must have passed out.

40:52.552 --> 40:55.146
Thanks for not saying the other thing.

40:59.352 --> 41:01.741
That was a Hail Mary.

41:11.552 --> 41:14.430
Thank you. Take your time.

41:15.712 --> 41:17.703
Man down.
