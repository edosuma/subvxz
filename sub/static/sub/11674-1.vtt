WEBVTT

00:39.915 --> 00:41.075
On January 2nd,

00:41.208 --> 00:43.252
I was quietly summoned
to the Pentagon

00:43.419 --> 00:45.921
to meet with
the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

00:46.088 --> 00:48.883
Each branch was represented--

00:49.050 --> 00:52.386
the Army, the Air Force,

00:52.553 --> 00:55.389
the Navy, and the Marines.

00:55.556 --> 00:57.892
"Michael,"
they said to me,

00:58.059 --> 01:00.394
"We don't know
what the fuck we're doing."

01:00.561 --> 01:04.272
 Dressed up to win,
we're dressed up to win... 

01:04.440 --> 01:08.027
They hadn't won a war outright
since the big one, WWII.

01:08.194 --> 01:11.781
 We are just beginning
and we won't stop winning... 

01:11.947 --> 01:15.242
They went over
each of the wars that they had lost.

01:16.911 --> 01:18.037
One...

01:18.204 --> 01:20.206
after...

01:20.372 --> 01:22.374
the other.

01:24.877 --> 01:28.130
They regretted
having wasted trillions of dollars

01:28.297 --> 01:32.301
and helping to create
new groups like ISIS.

01:32.468 --> 01:35.971
They admitted that what they got
from these wars was just...

01:36.138 --> 01:37.640
more war.

01:37.807 --> 01:41.727
They couldn't even get us the oil
they promised us from Iraq.

01:41.894 --> 01:45.523
They felt embarrassed,
humiliated.

01:45.689 --> 01:48.818
Their hands were all placed
in a no-fly zone.

01:49.944 --> 01:52.655
They asked me for my advice.

01:55.991 --> 01:59.328
I thought for a moment
and then said the following.

01:59.495 --> 02:02.123
"You must stand down."

02:02.289 --> 02:05.668
I told them that our troops
needed a much-deserved break.

02:05.835 --> 02:08.920
Finally a break.
Finally some downtime.

02:09.088 --> 02:11.465
For the foreseeable future,

02:11.632 --> 02:13.968
there are
to be no invasions,

02:14.135 --> 02:16.428
no sending in
military advisors...

02:17.596 --> 02:20.266
no more using drones
as wedding crashers.

02:21.433 --> 02:25.146
Instead of sending in the Marines,
my suggestion?

02:25.312 --> 02:26.814
Send in me.

02:28.023 --> 02:31.026
I will invade countries
populated by Caucasians

02:31.193 --> 02:33.487
with names I can
mostly pronounce,

02:33.654 --> 02:36.365
take the things
we need from them,

02:36.532 --> 02:41.370
and bring it all back home
to the United States of America.

02:42.538 --> 02:46.041
For we have problems
no army could solve.

02:47.376 --> 02:49.545
I believe
our government has a responsibility

02:49.712 --> 02:51.380
to go to the aid of its citizens.

02:51.547 --> 02:54.550
The life of a Vietnam vet
comes to a tragic end.

02:54.717 --> 02:56.927
The man was found frozen
to death in his own home...

02:57.094 --> 03:00.639
After Consumers Energy
turned his natural gas off.

03:00.806 --> 03:03.851
I've made it clear
that we will hunt down terrorists

03:04.018 --> 03:06.729
who threaten our country
wherever they are.

03:06.896 --> 03:09.773
You will find no safe haven.

03:11.400 --> 03:13.736
Our enemies
are innovative and resourceful,

03:13.903 --> 03:15.321
and so are we.

03:15.487 --> 03:16.864
They never stop thinking
about new ways

03:17.031 --> 03:18.741
to harm our country
and our people

03:18.908 --> 03:21.952
and neither do we.

03:22.119 --> 03:23.829
This country will hunt down terrorists

03:23.996 --> 03:25.372
and bring them to justice.

03:25.539 --> 03:28.167
- On your face!
- No! Let me go!

03:34.757 --> 03:37.718
The rule of law,
not the law of the jungle,

03:37.885 --> 03:40.429
governs the conduct of nations.

03:40.596 --> 03:43.474
Let her go! Let her go!

03:43.641 --> 03:46.352
One of the things
this country stands for is...

03:46.518 --> 03:48.437
Put your hand
behind your back.

03:48.604 --> 03:51.815
- ...freedom.
- I can't breathe. I can't breathe.

03:51.982 --> 03:54.276
I can't breathe.

03:57.238 --> 03:59.907
We're disrupting their command
and control and supply lines.

04:00.074 --> 04:02.159
We're destroying their facilities
and infrastructure

04:02.326 --> 04:04.078
that fund their operations.

04:05.663 --> 04:08.207
We cannot save
all the world's children,

04:08.374 --> 04:10.459
but we can save many of them.

04:10.626 --> 04:12.336
Some school districts
are asking parents

04:12.503 --> 04:16.048
to buy toilet paper
for the upcoming school year.

04:18.716 --> 04:21.470
Our troops will have
the best possible support

04:21.637 --> 04:23.138
in the entire world.

04:23.305 --> 04:24.974
Banks illegally foreclosed

04:25.140 --> 04:29.520
on nearly 5,000 service members
while they were fighting abroad.

04:32.648 --> 04:34.483
We destroyed a threat

04:34.650 --> 04:37.653
and locked a tyrant
in the prison of his own country.

04:37.820 --> 04:39.822
I've been in prison almost 42 years

04:39.989 --> 04:41.031
for something I didn't do.

04:41.198 --> 04:43.575
I spent my 20s, my 30s, my 40s

04:43.742 --> 04:46.370
and nearly all of my 50s
in prison.

04:47.621 --> 04:49.081
Should the day come
when we Americans

04:49.248 --> 04:51.583
remain silent in the face
of armed aggression...

04:51.750 --> 04:53.544
A doctor in the middle
of the abortion debate

04:53.711 --> 04:56.463
was gunned down in the church lobby
while serving as an usher.

04:56.630 --> 04:59.425
...then the cause of freedom
will have been lost.

05:01.927 --> 05:04.388
We will not hesitate
to use our military might

05:04.555 --> 05:07.141
to defend our allies
and our way of life.

05:07.308 --> 05:10.352
Hands up, don't shoot.

05:21.697 --> 05:25.034
I hitched a ride
aboard the U.S.S. Ronald Reagan

05:25.200 --> 05:29.038
and made my way
to my first target--

05:29.204 --> 05:31.832
the country of Italy.

05:41.050 --> 05:42.718
It was time...

05:45.387 --> 05:47.056
to invade.

05:52.019 --> 05:54.563
Have you ever noticed that Italians

05:54.730 --> 05:58.067
always look like
they just had sex?

06:06.367 --> 06:08.911
Meet Gianni
and Cristina Fancelli,

06:09.078 --> 06:12.206
two working-class Italians.

06:12.373 --> 06:13.916
Gianni is a cop

06:14.083 --> 06:17.419
and Cristina orders clothes
for department stores.

06:17.586 --> 06:19.713
It was my first encounter
with the enemy.

06:19.880 --> 06:22.091
They led me to their compound

06:22.257 --> 06:25.969
where they wouldn't shut up
about where they had gone on vacation.

06:26.136 --> 06:29.973
We usually plan one week
during the winter...

06:30.974 --> 06:33.018
and then the first week
of June...

06:33.185 --> 06:35.521
- Right.
- ...because it's our anniversary.

06:35.687 --> 06:36.814
Okay.

06:36.980 --> 06:38.732
Then three weeks in August.

06:38.899 --> 06:39.942
Okay.

06:40.109 --> 06:42.027
'Cause in Italy,
during the month of August

06:42.194 --> 06:44.279
is usually, like,
a shutdown.

06:44.446 --> 06:45.781
And are you paid
for these weeks?

06:45.948 --> 06:48.617
Yeah, sure,
because every year

06:48.784 --> 06:51.412
we usually have,
like, 30, 35 days

06:51.578 --> 06:52.955
of, you know, holiday.

06:53.122 --> 06:54.289
- Paid holiday, yeah.
- We don't pay.

06:54.456 --> 06:58.210
So, wait, that's five days a week--
that's seven weeks.

06:58.377 --> 07:00.546
Plus, we have
the national holidays.

07:00.712 --> 07:01.922
How many are there of those?

07:02.089 --> 07:03.729
- Dodici.
- 12? 12 days.

07:03.799 --> 07:05.239
So that's another week or two.

07:06.802 --> 07:09.054
Ah, each city
has a saint patron.

07:09.221 --> 07:10.597
Patron saint, yeah.

07:10.764 --> 07:12.933
- It's a city holiday.
- You're paid for this date?

07:13.100 --> 07:15.102
- Yes.
- Yes.

07:15.269 --> 07:16.979
And when you get married,

07:17.146 --> 07:19.648
you have 15 days more.

07:19.815 --> 07:21.233
Yeah.

07:21.400 --> 07:22.526
- 15-- wait a minute.
- 15.

07:22.693 --> 07:26.071
When you get married,
you have 15 days' paid holiday?

07:26.238 --> 07:28.598
- To go on honeymoon.
- To pay for your honeymoon?

07:28.699 --> 07:30.139
- Yes.
- They pay for your honeymoon?

07:30.284 --> 07:31.660
Yes.

07:31.827 --> 07:34.663
Eight weeks' paid vacation.

07:34.830 --> 07:38.792
In December, we have
an additional salary in Italy.

07:38.959 --> 07:41.039
- Most-- I think everybody.
- What's additional mean?

07:41.170 --> 07:45.257
We call it 13th
because 12 months.

07:45.424 --> 07:48.260
So we have the 13th salary
in December.

07:50.679 --> 07:52.556
- Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
- Yes.

07:52.723 --> 07:54.475
You get this 13th month,

07:54.641 --> 07:56.643
this imaginary month
that you didn't work...

07:56.810 --> 07:58.520
- Yes.
- ...and then you get--

07:58.687 --> 08:01.523
Another salary
during the month of December.

08:01.690 --> 08:04.610
Like, what, 10% more?
20?

08:04.776 --> 08:07.029
No, no, a full salary.

08:07.196 --> 08:09.573
So you get two months' pay
for one month of work?

08:09.740 --> 08:11.200
Yes.

08:11.366 --> 08:12.534
Why?

08:12.701 --> 08:15.913
Your regular pay
is to pay the monthly bills.

08:16.079 --> 08:18.499
What money do you have left over
to go on vacation?

08:18.665 --> 08:20.209
That's the way
the Italians see it.

08:20.375 --> 08:24.004
What good's a vacation
if you can't afford to go on it?

08:25.214 --> 08:27.716
If you don't use
all those days,

08:27.883 --> 08:32.513
the following year, you still have
the vacation of the previous year.

08:32.679 --> 08:34.765
- Wait a minute.
- So you don't lose that.

08:34.932 --> 08:36.475
- No, no, that's not true.
- It's true.

08:36.642 --> 08:38.519
No, that's not true.

08:38.684 --> 08:41.188
Tell him, tell him
how many days you have.

08:44.441 --> 08:47.110
- 80 days.
- You have 80 days in the bank?

08:47.277 --> 08:48.957
In the holiday bank.

08:52.824 --> 08:54.618
He would like
to do more, of course.

08:54.785 --> 08:56.954
Of course.

08:57.120 --> 08:59.289
But how do companies
make any money

08:59.456 --> 09:02.167
if they pay all this
to their employees?

09:02.334 --> 09:04.419
I approached the owner
of a multimillion-dollar

09:04.586 --> 09:07.089
clothing manufacturer,
the Lardini Company,

09:07.256 --> 09:11.093
who makes men's fashions
for brands like Dolce & Gabbana,

09:11.260 --> 09:13.762
Burberry, and Versace.

09:13.929 --> 09:15.764
Do you mind
paying your employees

09:15.931 --> 09:17.432
for all this time off?

09:37.619 --> 09:43.083
And stress causes a lot of sickness.

09:43.250 --> 09:44.751
So, do you get sick very often?

09:44.918 --> 09:45.919
No.

09:54.636 --> 09:58.765
Italians have one of the highest
life expectancies in the world.

09:58.932 --> 10:01.852
They live four years longer
than the average American.

10:20.412 --> 10:23.999
Yes, it's lunchtime at Lardini.

10:24.166 --> 10:27.461
But they're not getting in their cars
to drive to the vending machine

10:27.628 --> 10:29.046
or the takeout window.

10:30.714 --> 10:33.467
They're going home,
like they do every day,

10:33.634 --> 10:37.763
for a nice, relaxing two-hour lunch.

10:46.688 --> 10:48.857
Do you come home
every day for lunch?

10:55.030 --> 10:57.115
I continued my invasion of Italy

10:57.282 --> 11:00.911
by going to the Ducati
motorcycle company.

11:01.078 --> 11:03.872
Agreeing to meet with me
for a possible surrender

11:04.039 --> 11:08.710
was the C.E.O. of Ducati,
Claudio Domenicali.

11:08.877 --> 11:11.338
There is the very end
of the assembly line.

11:11.505 --> 11:13.882
You call this an assembly line?

11:14.049 --> 11:16.259
The line is hardly moving.

11:16.426 --> 11:18.512
- It's moving very, very slow.
- Very slow.

11:18.679 --> 11:20.681
The C.E.O. explained to me
that his workers

11:20.847 --> 11:23.558
have numerous weeks
of paid vacation,

11:23.725 --> 11:27.396
including other benefits,
as well as a strong union.

11:29.231 --> 11:32.693
He saw no problem
with any of this.

11:32.859 --> 11:36.571
We really feel that we are
being rewarded by this,

11:36.738 --> 11:38.740
because the people
are very committed.

11:38.907 --> 11:41.868
There is no clash
between the profit of the company

11:42.035 --> 11:44.538
and the well-being of the people.

11:44.705 --> 11:47.708
"There is no clash
between the profit of the company

11:47.874 --> 11:49.251
and the well-being of the people."

11:49.418 --> 11:50.460
Yes.

11:50.627 --> 11:54.673
He explained that by paying
a good wage with good benefits,

11:54.840 --> 11:57.092
the company still made
a healthy profit.

11:59.636 --> 12:03.056
Here we go again.
You know what that means.

12:03.223 --> 12:06.226
It's lunchtime, I-talian style.

12:06.393 --> 12:09.771
Grown men eating vegetables
and smiling?

12:14.234 --> 12:15.861
What kind of factory was this?

12:16.027 --> 12:18.488
All the fine benefits
these workers have--

12:18.655 --> 12:22.784
vacation, a wonderful lunch--

12:22.951 --> 12:24.077
how did this come about?

12:36.631 --> 12:39.259
Is it still a struggle?

12:50.437 --> 12:52.606
It's the system
that's part of the welfare, no?

12:52.773 --> 12:54.441
- Yeah, the social welfare.
- Yeah, of course--

12:54.608 --> 12:56.526
Welfare's a bad word
in the United States...

12:56.693 --> 12:58.612
- Okay.
- ...with certain conservative people.

12:58.779 --> 13:00.739
They don't like that word, welfare.

13:00.906 --> 13:02.407
- Here, it's not bad.
- It's not a bad word.

13:02.574 --> 13:03.950
- For whatever reason.
- It's a good word.

13:04.117 --> 13:05.494
Yeah, it's a good word.
Of course, you pay more--

13:05.660 --> 13:06.828
You take care
of the welfare of the people.

13:06.995 --> 13:08.747
You take more-- you pay
more taxes for that.

13:08.914 --> 13:09.998
Uh-huh.
You mind that?

13:10.165 --> 13:14.127
Because when you pay something
and you get something back...

13:14.294 --> 13:15.712
- Yeah?
- That's okay, you know?

13:15.879 --> 13:18.965
I asked the Lardini family
if they felt the same.

13:19.132 --> 13:22.385
You, the boss, C.E.O.,
if you did it the American way,

13:22.552 --> 13:26.181
you could make more money
and have more for yourselves.

13:47.869 --> 13:49.204
And you agree
with your sisters?

13:49.371 --> 13:50.497
Yes.

13:54.084 --> 13:56.419
He says that many Italians--

13:56.586 --> 14:00.173
that the dream of Italian people
is to come to America.

14:00.340 --> 14:01.508
To United States.

14:01.675 --> 14:04.761
Maybe they don't know
how it works there.

14:06.555 --> 14:07.722
Yeah, you know
what the law says in America?

14:07.889 --> 14:09.641
If you come to America,
for paid vacation,

14:09.808 --> 14:12.060
you know how many paid weeks
you get by law?

14:12.227 --> 14:13.311
- No.
- Zero.

14:13.478 --> 14:17.232
- Zero?
- Yes, zero.

14:17.399 --> 14:18.817
Zero.

14:20.902 --> 14:22.737
I'm serious.

14:22.904 --> 14:25.240
So, would you think twice now
about living in America,

14:25.407 --> 14:27.742
knowing that you get
zero paid weeks' vacation?

14:27.909 --> 14:29.744
Zero. It's zero.
Zero.

14:29.911 --> 14:33.039
Their law does not mandate
a paid vacation for anybody.

14:33.206 --> 14:36.585
So, if you decide to go on holiday,
you're not paid for that days?

14:36.751 --> 14:37.794
- So, it's--
- That is correct.

14:37.961 --> 14:39.880
Now, if you have a good union,

14:40.046 --> 14:43.300
you may have a contract that says
you get two weeks' paid vacation.

14:43.466 --> 14:45.677
- In a year?
- In a year. That would be good.

14:45.844 --> 14:47.596
- Two weeks would be a good--
- So, two weeks is a good--

14:47.762 --> 14:49.264
- A good job.
- Wow.

14:49.431 --> 14:51.808
- Three would be awesome.
- Ah.

14:51.975 --> 14:53.351
If you have that kind of job.

14:53.518 --> 14:55.645
I don't know anybody
with four weeks' paid vacation, frankly.

14:55.812 --> 14:56.897
I don't know.

14:57.063 --> 14:59.024
Zero paid weeks guaranteed.
Zero.

15:16.750 --> 15:19.336
I see what's going on here.

15:19.502 --> 15:22.005
First comes eight weeks
of vacation sex

15:22.172 --> 15:23.506
and then comes...

15:26.468 --> 15:30.430
You have five months
of maternity leave.

15:30.597 --> 15:32.390
Five months?
Are you paid for this?

15:32.557 --> 15:35.101
- Yes, sure.
- What do you mean, "Yes, sure"?

15:35.268 --> 15:36.353
You act as if I--

15:36.519 --> 15:39.481
It's something that for us
is very natural.

15:39.648 --> 15:40.732
What about the dad?

15:40.899 --> 15:42.567
I think one or the other can--

15:42.734 --> 15:43.818
Esatto.

15:43.985 --> 15:45.445
It's like a substitution, you know?

15:45.612 --> 15:47.332
But the mother
must take five months?

15:47.489 --> 15:48.657
For sure.

16:01.503 --> 16:06.174
It's true, the whole world
does have paid maternity leave,

16:06.341 --> 16:09.844
except for the two countries
too poor to afford it--

16:10.011 --> 16:13.348
Papua New Guinea
and this place.

16:16.309 --> 16:20.981
Even with the long vacations
and extended lunch breaks,

16:21.147 --> 16:23.566
the U.S. and Italy
are amongst the top 15

16:23.733 --> 16:26.111
most productive countries
in the world.

16:26.277 --> 16:28.613
We work many more hours
than Italians,

16:28.780 --> 16:30.740
but we are not that much more
productive than you.

16:34.869 --> 16:36.705
I believe that's true.

16:36.871 --> 16:39.541
I believe that you are having
more sex here

16:39.708 --> 16:43.336
and because of that you are happier
and you do better at work.

16:49.175 --> 16:51.052
 Volare... 

16:52.554 --> 16:54.222
 Oh, oh... 

16:56.141 --> 16:58.977
I've come to Italy
and I've invaded Italy--

16:59.144 --> 17:00.979
one man, one-man army--

17:01.146 --> 17:05.817
to take the best ideas I can find here,
bring them back to America,

17:05.983 --> 17:08.278
and convince
my fellow Americans

17:08.444 --> 17:11.823
to do some of the things
that the Italians do.

17:11.990 --> 17:14.117
And one of the things
I'm going to take from you

17:14.284 --> 17:18.788
is this concept of giving workers
eight weeks' paid vacation.

17:21.583 --> 17:23.126
Two or three years from now,
they're gonna be known

17:23.292 --> 17:25.920
as American ideas
from that point on,

17:26.087 --> 17:27.756
even though you were
doing it here first.

17:27.922 --> 17:28.965
- Yeah.
- You don't mind?

17:29.132 --> 17:30.508
No mind.
No worries.

17:30.675 --> 17:31.926
I shake your hand for that.

17:32.093 --> 17:33.178
Thank you, sir.

17:33.344 --> 17:35.221
And thank you for being
the first C.E.O.

17:35.388 --> 17:38.433
to meet with me
on a factory floor.

17:38.600 --> 17:40.852
- Big pleasure.
- Yeah, I got my American flag here.

17:41.019 --> 17:43.938
And I'm gonna plant my flag
here at Ducati.

17:44.105 --> 17:45.940
Good. We've got something.

17:46.107 --> 17:48.359
We've got something good
for the United States here.

17:48.526 --> 17:52.655
I'm gonna just plant the American flag
right here in your living room.

17:52.822 --> 17:54.949
- Oh.
- Is that okay?

17:55.116 --> 17:56.117
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

17:56.284 --> 17:57.660
- Salute.
- Salute.

17:57.827 --> 18:01.331
Sure, Italy has its problems,
like all countries,

18:01.498 --> 18:05.376
but my mission is to pick
the flowers, not the weeds.

18:05.543 --> 18:09.297
- We have just one life.
- Right, yeah.

18:09.464 --> 18:11.174
- That's the only one we have.
- We're not coming back.

18:11.341 --> 18:13.635
And we have to enjoy it.

18:13.802 --> 18:17.597
 Your love has given me wings... 

18:33.279 --> 18:35.615
- I am French.
- Ooh.

18:35.782 --> 18:36.825
You say you're French?

18:36.991 --> 18:38.034
Oui.

18:38.201 --> 18:41.412
"We"?
No, we are not French.

18:41.579 --> 18:44.040
We're American
'cause you're in America.

18:44.207 --> 18:46.417
Okay?
Greatest country on the planet.

18:46.584 --> 18:48.211
Well, what have you
given the world

18:48.378 --> 18:52.757
apart from George Bush, Cheerios,
and the ThighMaster?

18:52.924 --> 18:54.843
- Chinese food.
- Chinese food.

18:55.009 --> 18:56.094
That's from China.

18:56.261 --> 18:58.638
- Pizza.
- Italy.

18:58.805 --> 19:01.349
- Chimichanga.
- Mexico.

19:01.516 --> 19:03.685
Really, smarty-pants?
What did Frenchland give us?

19:03.852 --> 19:08.356
We invented democracy,
existentialism,

19:08.523 --> 19:09.899
and the blowjob.

19:10.066 --> 19:12.485
Those are three pretty good things.

19:16.406 --> 19:18.158
Yes, there was all that,

19:18.324 --> 19:22.162
but there was something else
we could steal from France.

19:22.328 --> 19:26.332
As usual, the French
offered little resistance.

19:29.127 --> 19:32.130
So, I entered a small village
in rural Normandy

19:32.297 --> 19:34.924
and went to one of the finest kitchens
in the country

19:35.091 --> 19:38.011
to see how they prepare
a gourmet meal.

19:38.178 --> 19:43.391
By my standards, it was a three,
maybe a four-star kitchen.

19:43.558 --> 19:47.437
It was definitely
the best place to eat in town.

19:47.604 --> 19:50.899
It was the school cafeteria.

20:19.052 --> 20:21.763
I only had
one year of French in school.

20:21.930 --> 20:23.973
Would you like to hear
my first lesson in French?

20:24.140 --> 20:27.060
- Yes.
- Ahem.

20:45.161 --> 20:47.497
The French love their cheese

20:47.664 --> 20:50.041
and they eat a lot of it.

20:50.208 --> 20:53.211
Chef Montignac
had dozens of types of cheese

20:53.378 --> 20:55.964
right here
in the school refrigerator.

21:01.636 --> 21:03.638
I showed the kids
what I used to do at their age

21:03.805 --> 21:08.977
when the lunch lady served us
what she called Thursday Surprise.

21:09.143 --> 21:12.438
The American way.
Didn't take long to get this going.

21:19.946 --> 21:22.156
Once a month,
the school chef gets together

21:22.323 --> 21:23.950
with city and school officials

21:24.117 --> 21:27.370
and a dietician
to go over the daily menu.

21:31.833 --> 21:33.543
Why is the mayor's office
concerned

21:33.710 --> 21:38.089
with what is being served
in the school cafeteria?

21:44.679 --> 21:47.849
See, here in France,
lunchtime isn't just 20 minutes

21:48.016 --> 21:50.852
where you have to stuff your face
as fast as you can.

21:51.019 --> 21:53.563
They consider lunch a class.

21:53.730 --> 21:58.651
A full hour where you learn
how to eat in a civilized manner,

21:58.818 --> 22:02.113
enjoy healthy food,
and serve each other.

22:03.948 --> 22:06.534
And, yes, drink water.

22:07.535 --> 22:09.829
Lots of water.

22:09.996 --> 22:12.540
Mm, water.

22:14.959 --> 22:17.837
They don't stand in a long line
waiting for a bunch of slop

22:18.004 --> 22:20.298
on their plastic
or Styrofoam tray.

22:21.924 --> 22:24.802
Wow, actual real china.

22:26.888 --> 22:29.098
Yeah.

22:31.684 --> 22:33.770
The chefs bring the food to them.

22:35.021 --> 22:37.106
Scallops with a curry sauce.

22:39.942 --> 22:42.070
Wow, and-- and with carrots?

22:43.946 --> 22:45.031
Oh, okay.

22:45.198 --> 22:47.825
And this was just the appetizer.

22:49.202 --> 22:51.079
C'est bon.

22:51.245 --> 22:52.288
French fries.

22:52.455 --> 22:53.539
Oh, oui.

22:55.750 --> 22:57.543
Two times a year
you'll have French fries.

22:57.710 --> 23:00.254
But French is in the wording.

23:00.421 --> 23:03.216
I couldn't find a single
vending machine in the school,

23:03.383 --> 23:05.927
so I smuggled in some contraband.

23:06.094 --> 23:08.262
- Do you drink Coca-Cola?
- No.

23:08.429 --> 23:10.807
You don't-- no?
No Coca-Cola? No?

23:10.973 --> 23:13.726
Coca-Cola? You don't drink--
you don't drink Coca-Cola?

23:13.893 --> 23:16.646
No?
Nobody drinks Coca-Cola?

23:16.813 --> 23:18.064
No.

23:18.231 --> 23:21.150
Here, try this.
Try this.

23:21.317 --> 23:23.277
- No.
- No.

23:23.444 --> 23:25.405
Want to try Coca-Cola?

23:42.463 --> 23:45.133
- It tastes good.
- It's what?

23:45.299 --> 23:46.968
Pretty good.

23:47.135 --> 23:49.387
It's okay?

23:49.554 --> 23:52.140
All right, tell me how you feel
in 15 minutes.

23:56.727 --> 23:58.438
How about a sloppy joe?

23:58.604 --> 24:00.314
Jamais. Never.

24:00.481 --> 24:01.761
- Never?
- Not at all.

24:01.816 --> 24:03.985
On this day,
the children were being served

24:04.152 --> 24:07.447
lamb skewers and chicken
over couscous.

24:07.613 --> 24:11.075
A four-course meal
that included a cheese course

24:11.242 --> 24:12.952
and dessert.

24:13.119 --> 24:15.121
Here's something
I had never seen before.

24:15.288 --> 24:19.250
When does a kid
share his ice cream?

24:19.417 --> 24:21.002
Come on,
you've had a Whopper.

24:21.169 --> 24:24.672
You've snuck somewhere
sometime in your life and had a Whopper.

24:27.467 --> 24:30.303
Well, you haven't lived
till you've had a Whopper.

24:30.470 --> 24:32.346
What's for lunch?

24:32.513 --> 24:34.348
The daughter
of one of our crew members

24:34.515 --> 24:37.018
is a high school student
near Boston.

24:37.185 --> 24:39.228
When she heard we were
filming a school lunch,

24:39.395 --> 24:40.980
she started sending
her mother pictures

24:41.147 --> 24:43.524
of what her school lunch
looked like.

24:43.691 --> 24:47.111
This is what American children
eat for lunch.

24:50.031 --> 24:51.231
Okay, yes,
that looks familiar.

24:54.869 --> 24:56.537
Does that look good to you?

24:56.704 --> 24:58.414
- No.
- No.

24:59.749 --> 25:01.417
We don't know what's inside this.

25:03.377 --> 25:05.097
No, no, no, no.

25:07.715 --> 25:09.884
Yeah.
I know, it's like I'm showing you

25:10.051 --> 25:12.595
photographs
on an episode of "C.S.I." here.

25:12.762 --> 25:15.640
Uh...

25:17.850 --> 25:21.771
You know it's bad
when the French pity you.

25:21.938 --> 25:25.191
What's even more remarkable
is that Chef Montignac

25:25.358 --> 25:27.485
spends less per lunch
than we do

25:27.652 --> 25:30.446
in our schools
in the United States.

25:30.613 --> 25:34.283
And this public school
is not in a wealthy area.

25:34.450 --> 25:37.411
In fact, I got ahold
of a copy of the menu

25:37.578 --> 25:41.165
from one of the poorest schools
in one of the poorest towns in France,

25:41.332 --> 25:44.418
and this is what
they're eating this month.

25:44.585 --> 25:47.171
A filet of cod in a dill sauce.

25:47.338 --> 25:48.631
Fennel and beef stew.

25:48.798 --> 25:49.966
Moussaka.

25:50.132 --> 25:53.177
And a choice between
a caramel or vanilla flan.

25:53.344 --> 25:55.930
Not to mention
there's at least one cheese option

25:56.097 --> 25:58.516
every single day.

25:58.683 --> 26:01.852
It seemed almost unbelievable
that this country,

26:02.019 --> 26:04.855
which provides
free health care for its people,

26:05.022 --> 26:07.441
nearly free day care,
also makes sure

26:07.608 --> 26:11.279
that the school lunches
are fit for a king.

26:11.445 --> 26:16.117
I had to ask myself,
how do the French afford all of this?

26:16.284 --> 26:20.037
Europe, for the past four decades,
has been raising taxes.

26:20.204 --> 26:21.872
Very high income taxes.

26:22.039 --> 26:24.458
- Some higher taxes.
- They're sick of the high taxes.

26:24.625 --> 26:26.961
Gérard Depardieu said,
"No more!

26:27.128 --> 26:28.379
I'm outta here."

26:28.546 --> 26:30.381
Here's how much
the average working American

26:30.548 --> 26:33.217
pays in income
and social security taxes.

26:33.384 --> 26:36.220
And those taxes get us
the basic services--

26:36.387 --> 26:41.934
police, fire, roads, water, war,
and bank bailouts.

26:42.101 --> 26:45.521
And here's what the average
French worker pays in taxes.

26:45.688 --> 26:47.189
A little more than we do.

26:47.356 --> 26:49.025
And for paying
just a little bit more,

26:49.191 --> 26:51.277
they, too,
get the basic services,

26:51.444 --> 26:55.323
but they also get
all this extra stuff.

26:55.489 --> 26:57.491
We can get some of that stuff, too,

26:57.658 --> 26:59.577
but we have to pay extra.

26:59.744 --> 27:03.372
And when we pay extra,
we don't call it a tax.

27:03.539 --> 27:07.752
We call it tuition and day care fees

27:07.918 --> 27:09.920
and the nursing home bill

27:10.087 --> 27:15.509
and copays and deductibles
and on and on and on.

27:15.676 --> 27:18.804
We don't call them taxes,
but they are,

27:18.971 --> 27:22.433
and we pay a whole lot more
than the French.

27:22.600 --> 27:25.519
One more thing--
every French paycheck

27:25.686 --> 27:30.858
has a detailed list of where their taxes
are going, line by line.

27:31.025 --> 27:32.818
This is what our paycheck
looks like.

27:32.985 --> 27:34.987
Other than Social Security
and Medicare,

27:35.154 --> 27:37.198
it doesn't say a damn thing.

27:37.365 --> 27:39.700
Maybe if we saw where
our income taxes were going,

27:39.867 --> 27:42.536
we wouldn't let Congress
spend nearly 60% of it

27:42.703 --> 27:44.372
on this.

27:50.169 --> 27:53.881
But the French aren't fighters,
they're lovers.

27:54.048 --> 27:58.552
 Sweetheart,
Pepé Le Pew loves you... 

27:58.719 --> 28:01.722
And if there's one thing
the French know how to do right,

28:01.889 --> 28:05.685
it's passion and desire.

28:05.851 --> 28:09.188
But where do you learn
something like that?

28:31.752 --> 28:33.629
Magical moment?

28:33.796 --> 28:36.048
I thought the whole point of sex ed
when I was in school

28:36.215 --> 28:38.384
was to scare us
from ever having any.

28:38.551 --> 28:42.263
Now, you took a risk by doing something
that society condemns.

28:42.430 --> 28:46.267
Perhaps you didn't realize
some of the penalties involved syphilis.

28:46.434 --> 28:48.519
Syphilis?

28:52.231 --> 28:53.774
Oui?

28:57.111 --> 28:59.363
Yeah, but what about abstinence?

29:11.959 --> 29:14.253
Too risky?
What does she mean by that?

29:14.420 --> 29:16.630
A small high school in West Texas

29:16.797 --> 29:18.507
that does not offer sex education

29:18.674 --> 29:20.926
is dealing with an STD outbreak.

29:21.093 --> 29:25.055
A significant rise in STDs
among Utah teens.

29:25.222 --> 29:27.057
Parents can always
preach abstinence,

29:27.224 --> 29:29.351
but teens, we know,
don't always listen.

29:29.518 --> 29:31.438
- A chlamydia outbreak.
- Chlamydia.

29:31.479 --> 29:32.521
Chlamydia.

29:32.688 --> 29:34.482
Why does Texas continue

29:34.648 --> 29:37.568
with abstinence
education programs

29:37.735 --> 29:39.153
when they don't seem
to be working?

29:39.320 --> 29:41.238
In fact, I think we have
the third highest teen pregnancy rate

29:41.405 --> 29:42.615
in the country,
among all the states.

29:42.782 --> 29:44.533
Abstinence works.

29:44.700 --> 29:46.911
But we are the third highest
teen pregnancy--

29:47.077 --> 29:48.287
we have the third highest

29:48.454 --> 29:50.998
teen pregnancy rate
among all states in the country.

29:51.165 --> 29:53.459
The questioner's point is
it doesn't seem to be working.

29:53.626 --> 29:57.838
I'm gonna tell you
from my own personal life,

29:58.005 --> 30:00.591
abstinence works.

30:05.846 --> 30:07.848
The teen pregnancy rate
in the United States

30:08.015 --> 30:10.059
is more than twice
France's rate,

30:10.226 --> 30:12.228
more than six times Germany's,

30:12.394 --> 30:14.730
and more than seven times
than the Swiss.

30:18.275 --> 30:20.653
Yes, education.

30:20.820 --> 30:23.113
I grabbed a copy
of their high school textbook,

30:23.280 --> 30:25.741
"Lovemaking is Fun,
Volume 1,"

30:25.908 --> 30:28.786
packed up a few
of their school lunches...

30:32.331 --> 30:35.835
and hopped aboard
what they call a train

30:36.001 --> 30:40.840
to a country that really was
number one in education.

30:42.466 --> 30:45.177
Finland is ranked at
or near the top

30:45.344 --> 30:48.806
of having the best-educated
students in the world.

30:48.973 --> 30:54.228
Which left everyone wondering,
"Really? Finland?"

30:55.646 --> 30:59.400
These are the people who gave us
the air guitar championship...

30:59.567 --> 31:02.236
Hello? Hello?

31:02.403 --> 31:05.406
...and the sports
of cell phone throwing

31:05.573 --> 31:07.074
and wife carrying.

31:10.077 --> 31:14.415
These are the geniuses
that cracked the code to good education?

31:14.582 --> 31:16.917
I mean, how is it
that the kids in Finland

31:17.084 --> 31:19.420
are ahead
of the rest of the world?

31:20.796 --> 31:22.590
So, here's what happened.

31:22.756 --> 31:25.050
Back in the day,
Finland's schools sucked

31:25.217 --> 31:27.094
on the level that ours suck on.

31:27.261 --> 31:29.013
When they tested the world's kids,

31:29.179 --> 31:31.765
both Finland and us
were usually about the same,

31:31.932 --> 31:34.727
you know, somewhere down
the list of nations.

31:34.894 --> 31:37.187
But Finland didn't like that,

31:37.354 --> 31:39.231
so they tried some new ideas

31:39.398 --> 31:43.152
and, in no time, Finland shot
to the top of the world.

31:43.319 --> 31:45.946
Their students were number one.

31:48.574 --> 31:50.993
How did they do that?

31:51.160 --> 31:54.496
That was the one question
I wanted an answer to.

31:54.663 --> 31:58.292
And I went straight to see
the enemy's minister of education.

31:58.459 --> 32:03.047
Before I could say anything,
she blurted out their top secret.

32:03.213 --> 32:04.715
They do not have homework.

32:07.134 --> 32:09.178
Wait, so you reduced
the homework you give them at school?

32:09.345 --> 32:10.429
Yes, yes.

32:10.596 --> 32:13.891
They should have more time
to be kids,

32:14.058 --> 32:15.498
to be youngsters, to enjoy the life.

32:18.354 --> 32:20.314
How many hours of homework
did you get last night?

32:20.439 --> 32:22.274
About 10 minutes or something.

32:22.441 --> 32:24.001
- 10 minutes of homework?
- Yeah.

32:24.026 --> 32:26.820
- Maybe 15 minutes or 20 minutes.
- 20 minutes.

32:26.987 --> 32:28.187
- 20 minutes?
- Not much. Yeah.

32:28.238 --> 32:30.032
Well, if I would've
done the homework,

32:30.199 --> 32:33.285
I think it would've been
like 10 minutes, tops.

32:33.452 --> 32:37.581
Usually I don't really
do homework that much.

32:37.748 --> 32:41.794
The whole term "homework"

32:41.961 --> 32:44.838
is kind of obsolete, I think.

32:45.005 --> 32:47.424
- In that way--
- Moore: Homework is obsolete?

32:47.591 --> 32:50.844
Yeah, yeah.
In that way that these kids,

32:51.011 --> 32:54.765
they have a lot of other things
to do after school.

32:54.932 --> 32:57.935
- Like what?
- Like being together,

32:58.102 --> 33:02.147
like being with family,
like doing sports,

33:02.314 --> 33:05.025
like playing music,
like reading.

33:05.192 --> 33:06.235
So they have no homework.

33:06.402 --> 33:08.153
What if all they want to do
is climb a tree?

33:08.320 --> 33:09.613
They could climb a tree, yeah.

33:09.780 --> 33:11.865
They can climb a tree.
Then they learned how to climb a tree.

33:12.032 --> 33:14.952
But they'll end up,
while climbing the tree,

33:15.119 --> 33:16.879
probably finding out
about different insects,

33:17.037 --> 33:18.539
and they can come
to school next day,

33:18.706 --> 33:21.458
tell me about what they found.

33:21.625 --> 33:23.002
Compared to the older kids,
how many hours a day

33:23.168 --> 33:24.837
do the younger ones
go to school?

33:26.755 --> 33:29.883
Mondays, three hours,
Tuesdays, four hours.

33:30.050 --> 33:32.469
It varies.
It's 20 hours a week.

33:32.636 --> 33:34.972
So they're-- oh, man.

33:35.139 --> 33:38.142
Now, does this three or four hours
of school include the lunch hour?

33:38.308 --> 33:39.893
Yes.

33:40.060 --> 33:41.103
How are they learning anything?

33:41.270 --> 33:42.590
How are you
getting anything done?

33:42.730 --> 33:46.400
Your brain has to-- it has to relax
every now and then.

33:46.567 --> 33:50.904
If you just constantly work, work, work,
then you stop learning.

33:51.071 --> 33:54.158
And there's no use of doing that
for a longer period of time.

33:54.324 --> 33:57.202
Finland's students
have the shortest school days

33:57.369 --> 34:02.249
and the shortest school years
in the entire Western world.

34:02.416 --> 34:05.836
They do better
by going to school less.

34:06.003 --> 34:08.422
Yay!

34:08.589 --> 34:10.424
How many languages
do you speak?

34:10.591 --> 34:13.092
English, yeah, Swedish,
Spanish.

34:13.260 --> 34:15.094
Finnish and Swedish.

34:15.262 --> 34:17.097
Finnish, English, and German.

34:17.264 --> 34:19.891
- French, German.
- Finnish and English.

34:20.059 --> 34:24.103
- English.
- Swedish and French and Spanish.

34:27.107 --> 34:28.867
So, you were
an exchange student in the U.S.?

34:28.942 --> 34:30.694
- Yeah.
- When you got back here in school,

34:30.860 --> 34:33.614
what did you notice
that you felt relieved about?

34:33.781 --> 34:36.742
No more multiple choice exams.
They--

34:36.909 --> 34:41.246
- No multiple choice exams here?
- Or very few of them, if any.

34:41.413 --> 34:43.791
- Really?
- 'Cause all of my exams in the U.S.--

34:43.956 --> 34:45.708
How do you answer the question right
if it isn't listed

34:45.876 --> 34:47.795
as one of the four choices?

34:47.960 --> 34:49.801
- You write your answer.
- You have to know it.

34:49.880 --> 34:51.465
- You have to know it, actually.
- Yeah.

34:51.632 --> 34:53.831
- You actually have to know it?
- Yeah.

34:54.635 --> 34:58.764
If there was one thing I heard
over and over again from the Finns,

34:58.931 --> 35:03.727
it was that America should stop
teaching to a standardized test.

35:03.894 --> 35:06.939
- Get rid of those standardized tests.
- National testing.

35:07.106 --> 35:09.483
- The standardized tests.
- The "standardizized testings."

35:09.650 --> 35:12.027
If what you are teaching your students
is to do well on those tests,

35:12.194 --> 35:13.654
then you're not really
teaching them anything.

35:13.821 --> 35:14.905
No, we are teaching them.

35:15.072 --> 35:16.615
We're teaching them
how to flunk a test

35:16.782 --> 35:19.034
and then a bunch of schools
fail the test

35:19.201 --> 35:21.495
and those schools
are turned into charter schools

35:21.662 --> 35:24.790
and then somebody
makes a lot of money.

35:24.957 --> 35:28.877
But school is about finding
your happiness, finding what--

35:29.044 --> 35:32.589
you know, finding a way to learn
what makes you happy.

35:33.632 --> 35:36.093
They figured out
about one-third of the school time--

35:36.260 --> 35:37.386
the students are in school--

35:37.553 --> 35:40.931
is spent preparing
for the standardized test.

35:41.098 --> 35:43.725
And so they've eliminated
a lot of things that aren't on the test.

35:43.892 --> 35:46.228
So, music is gone,
art is gone, poetry is gone.

35:46.395 --> 35:48.981
- Art is gone?
- Yeah, in many schools.

35:49.148 --> 35:51.483
Civics isn't even on the test,
so now schools are dropping civics.

35:51.650 --> 35:53.026
- Really?
- Yes.

35:53.193 --> 35:55.195
- Civics, American civics.
- Okay.

35:56.613 --> 35:57.698
Unbelievable.

35:57.865 --> 35:59.425
- We got rid of poetry.
- Really?

35:59.491 --> 36:00.701
- Yeah.
- Why?

36:00.868 --> 36:01.910
It's a waste of time.

36:02.077 --> 36:05.706
When are they ever gonna speak
as poets when they're adults?

36:05.873 --> 36:07.958
How does that
help them get a job?

36:14.673 --> 36:17.217
We try to teach them
everything that they need

36:17.384 --> 36:22.097
so that they could actually use
their brain as well as they can,

36:22.264 --> 36:26.852
including PE, including arts,
including music--

36:27.019 --> 36:30.397
anything that can actually
make brain work better.

36:30.564 --> 36:33.233
The children need to be baking,
they should be singing,

36:33.400 --> 36:36.236
they should be doing art
and going on nature walks

36:36.403 --> 36:39.698
and doing all these things
because there's this very short time

36:39.865 --> 36:42.534
that they're allowed
to be children.

36:47.164 --> 36:49.583
If you don't have standardized tests
here in Finland,

36:49.750 --> 36:52.920
how do you know
which schools are the best?

36:53.086 --> 36:54.713
You know, people need a list.

36:54.880 --> 36:57.674
The neighborhood school
is the best school.

36:57.841 --> 37:00.427
It is not different than the school

37:00.594 --> 37:03.722
which can be, for example,
situated in the town center,

37:03.889 --> 37:08.268
because all the schools in Finland,
they are all equal.

37:08.435 --> 37:11.271
When we move to a new city,

37:11.438 --> 37:13.106
we never ask
where the best school is.

37:13.273 --> 37:14.942
It's never a question.

37:15.108 --> 37:17.444
So nobody
has to shop for schools.

37:17.611 --> 37:20.113
There's nothing different
in any of our schools.

37:20.280 --> 37:21.323
They are the same.

37:21.490 --> 37:23.283
It is illegal in Finland

37:23.450 --> 37:26.453
to set up a school
and charge tuition.

37:26.620 --> 37:30.374
That's why, for the most part,
private schools don't exist.

37:30.540 --> 37:33.377
And what that means
is that the rich parents

37:33.543 --> 37:37.673
have to make sure
that the public schools are great.

37:37.839 --> 37:41.969
And by making the rich kids
go to school with everyone else,

37:42.135 --> 37:46.390
they grow up
with those other kids as friends.

37:46.556 --> 37:49.643
And when they become
wealthy adults,

37:49.810 --> 37:52.980
they have to think twice
before they screw them over.

37:54.356 --> 37:56.483
In the United States,
education is a business.

37:56.650 --> 37:58.944
They're corporations making money.

37:59.111 --> 38:04.032
Here, it's so student-centered
that when we had to redo our playground,

38:04.199 --> 38:07.160
they had the architects
come in and talk to the kids.

38:07.327 --> 38:09.538
- Were they listened to?
- Yes, yes.

38:09.705 --> 38:13.917
There are things on our playground
that the students really wanted.

38:14.084 --> 38:16.253
Being in school here
is more independent.

38:16.420 --> 38:18.505
We are treated more like adults
than in the United States.

38:18.672 --> 38:20.007
- Yeah.
- I mean, we don't need a hall pass

38:20.173 --> 38:21.533
to go to the bathroom
during class.

38:21.633 --> 38:22.634
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

38:22.801 --> 38:25.804
And we'll see students
commuting on the subway,

38:25.971 --> 38:30.475
even as young as seven and eight,
going on their own to school.

38:32.019 --> 38:36.523
When I started doing teacher training
practice back in the U.S.,

38:36.690 --> 38:40.527
I was in these certain neighborhoods
teaching these kids

38:40.694 --> 38:44.614
and telling them, "You can be anything
you want to be when you grow up."

38:46.616 --> 38:48.493
This is kind of a lie.

38:49.786 --> 38:52.706
And when I came to Finland,

38:52.873 --> 38:56.209
a lot of my teaching is based
on what the kids want

38:56.376 --> 38:58.587
and what they see for their future,

38:58.754 --> 39:02.257
so it doesn't feel so false
to say, "You can really be

39:02.424 --> 39:05.010
whatever you want to be
when you grow up,"

39:05.177 --> 39:07.721
because they're making it
happen already.

39:07.888 --> 39:10.307
They already have such power.

39:16.021 --> 39:17.773
That's upsetting

39:17.939 --> 39:19.858
to think about that.

39:20.025 --> 39:21.902
That our kids don't have that.

39:24.488 --> 39:26.073
That's really beautiful.

39:28.784 --> 39:31.411
It's not that we have
figured out something

39:31.578 --> 39:33.205
that nobody else has done
in education.

39:33.372 --> 39:34.581
That's wrong.

39:34.748 --> 39:39.586
Many of these things that have made
Finland perform well in education

39:39.753 --> 39:42.422
are initially American ideas.

39:43.590 --> 39:46.426
We try to teach them
to think for themselves

39:46.593 --> 39:48.970
and to be critical
to what they're learning.

39:49.137 --> 39:53.308
We try to teach them
to be happy person,

39:53.475 --> 39:56.686
to be-- respect others
and respect yourself.

39:56.853 --> 39:58.063
You're concerned
with their happiness.

39:58.230 --> 40:00.310
- Oh, yeah.
- What the hell do you teach?

40:00.399 --> 40:01.733
I teach math.

40:01.900 --> 40:04.540
So the math teacher says--
the first thing out of your mouth

40:04.653 --> 40:07.280
of what you wanted these students
to get out of school

40:07.447 --> 40:10.283
was to be happy,
have a happy life.

40:10.450 --> 40:12.035
Yep.

40:12.202 --> 40:14.413
- And you're the math teacher?
- Yep.

40:14.579 --> 40:17.290
When do they have
their time to play

40:17.457 --> 40:20.127
and socialize
with their friends

40:20.293 --> 40:23.422
and grow as human beings?

40:23.588 --> 40:28.385
'Cause there's so much more life
around than just school.

40:28.552 --> 40:29.928
You want them to play?

40:30.095 --> 40:32.639
I want children to play.

40:32.806 --> 40:36.184
And that was the principal.

40:36.351 --> 40:39.229
I'm planting the American flag
right here in the middle of your school

40:39.396 --> 40:41.815
and claiming
this great idea for us.

40:41.982 --> 40:43.525
Thanks for stealing it.

40:43.692 --> 40:46.069
Yeah, that's how we roll.

40:46.236 --> 40:47.904
- All right.
- I'm just saying.

40:50.407 --> 40:54.077
So after getting
a great K-12 education,

40:54.244 --> 40:57.038
where do you go next?

40:57.205 --> 41:01.460
Deep in the heart
of the eastern slopes of the Alps

41:01.626 --> 41:06.256
is the home of Rapunzel
and Sleeping Beauty--

41:06.423 --> 41:08.091
Slovenia.

41:08.258 --> 41:11.511
Not Slovakia, Slovenia.

41:11.678 --> 41:15.974
Actually, much of Slovenia's mail
gets missent to Slovakia,

41:16.141 --> 41:18.477
but that's not why I'm here.

41:18.643 --> 41:21.771
Slovenia is a magical fairyland

41:21.938 --> 41:24.858
home to the rarest
of mythical creatures--

41:25.025 --> 41:28.695
a college student with no debt.

41:28.862 --> 41:30.363
How much debt
do you have here, being a student?

41:30.530 --> 41:32.032
None.

41:32.199 --> 41:34.951
- None.
- It's free.

41:35.118 --> 41:38.330
Slovenia is one
of dozens of countries

41:38.497 --> 41:42.417
where it is essentially free
to go to university.

41:44.044 --> 41:46.213
Do you have any debts?

41:46.379 --> 41:47.839
No.

41:48.006 --> 41:49.246
Do you know what I mean
by debt?

41:49.341 --> 41:51.176
- Not really.
- No?

41:51.343 --> 41:56.014
Debt is, um, when you owe other people
a whole lot of money.

41:56.181 --> 41:58.225
- Ah. We don't have it.
- No, we don't have any. No.

41:58.391 --> 42:00.769
No. No.

42:00.936 --> 42:03.230
- Nothing?
- Nothing.

42:03.396 --> 42:07.067
I did find one student with debt.

42:07.234 --> 42:10.111
I actually moved here four years ago
to finish my education

42:10.278 --> 42:13.156
'cause I couldn't afford
to go to CU Boulder anymore.

42:13.323 --> 42:14.923
- Really?
- University of Colorado, yeah.

42:14.950 --> 42:18.370
- Yeah.
- I still owe the government $7,000.

42:18.537 --> 42:20.914
- So, what do you pay here now?
- I don't pay anything.

42:21.081 --> 42:22.415
- Nothing?
- No.

42:22.582 --> 42:24.822
You're an American?
Why'd you decide to come here?

42:24.876 --> 42:28.588
I couldn't even afford
to finish community college.

42:28.755 --> 42:30.924
So, then I found out
the situation in Slovenia.

42:31.091 --> 42:33.176
I had never heard
anything like that before,

42:33.343 --> 42:34.886
- school being so cheap.
- Did you even know where Slovenia was?

42:35.053 --> 42:36.930
No, I had no idea
where Slovenia was.

42:37.097 --> 42:39.766
Yeah, but, seriously, what kind
of education are you getting here?

42:39.933 --> 42:41.935
- It's miles better.
- Really?

42:42.102 --> 42:44.437
Yeah, it's not even comparable.

42:44.604 --> 42:45.981
It's like high school here
is more difficult

42:46.147 --> 42:49.109
than American
undergraduate work.

42:49.276 --> 42:52.445
How do you say in Slovenian,
"Any American student can come here

42:52.612 --> 42:54.406
and go to university for free?"

42:56.992 --> 42:59.703
Wait a minute. Slow, slow.

43:04.416 --> 43:05.856
Do you use
the regular alphabet here?

43:06.001 --> 43:07.502
A-B-C-D-E-F-G?

43:07.669 --> 43:08.753
Yes, we do.

43:10.630 --> 43:12.799
- We have 26, right?
- One less, yeah.

43:12.966 --> 43:14.968
Which one did you cut out?

43:16.803 --> 43:20.807
Did you cut out "W" while Bush
was president or was that before?

43:20.974 --> 43:22.017
I'm just curious.

43:22.183 --> 43:23.703
No, it's not--
it's from the beginning.

43:23.852 --> 43:25.353
It's from the beginning.
It has nothing to do with Bush.

43:25.520 --> 43:27.105
- No, nothing.
- Okay, all right.

43:27.272 --> 43:30.483
Luckily, the University
of Ljubljana in Slovenia

43:30.650 --> 43:35.655
offers nearly 100 courses of study
that are taught in English.

43:35.822 --> 43:37.662
Why do they do that?
You're a foreigner.

43:37.782 --> 43:41.202
I mean, it's-- their tax dollars
are paying for you.

43:41.369 --> 43:45.457
Well, I think-- the thing is that here,
education is really seen

43:45.624 --> 43:47.224
as something
that's really a public good,

43:47.334 --> 43:52.005
and the issue is once you start charging
foreign students for education,

43:52.172 --> 43:55.300
you automatically open up the idea
that you can charge everyone.

43:55.467 --> 43:57.385
And as soon as anyone
starts paying tuition,

43:57.552 --> 44:01.014
the entire idea of "free university
for everyone" is under threat.

44:03.516 --> 44:07.187
That changes the nature
of school being a public good.

44:07.354 --> 44:10.106
A while back,
the government of Slovenia

44:10.273 --> 44:14.069
decided it was time
to start charging students tuition.

44:14.235 --> 44:16.529
That sent a shock wave
through the country

44:16.696 --> 44:18.698
and the students responded.

44:26.373 --> 44:30.043
We organized
a protest against that law.

44:30.210 --> 44:33.380
We spent nine months meeting
with the minister for education,

44:33.546 --> 44:35.590
with the heads
of the universities.

44:35.757 --> 44:39.594
We managed to delay the law
long enough

44:39.761 --> 44:41.971
for the government
to eventually collapse.

44:42.138 --> 44:45.016
Wait a minute. An organization
that's got 40 to 50 active members...

44:45.183 --> 44:47.894
- Yes.
- ...and you helped to bring down

44:48.061 --> 44:49.562
- the government...
- That's right.

44:49.729 --> 44:51.815
- ...and force a new election?
- That's right.

44:51.981 --> 44:54.359
That's amazing.
That's an amazing story.

44:54.526 --> 44:56.569
Here's what students do

44:56.736 --> 45:00.740
when the government tries to fleece them
in countries like Canada...

45:00.907 --> 45:05.870
...Germany, France,

45:06.037 --> 45:09.874
Finland, and Norway.

45:11.835 --> 45:16.381
And here's what happens each time
there's a tuition hike in the U.S.

45:22.262 --> 45:24.222
I would like to give you
a small present to memorize...

45:24.389 --> 45:27.267
- Oh, thank you.
- ...your visit to the university.

45:27.434 --> 45:30.311
Here, there's a very strong tradition
of lace-making.

45:30.478 --> 45:31.896
- Of lace-making?
- Lace-making.

45:32.063 --> 45:34.733
But this is a metal lace.

45:34.899 --> 45:37.444
No man has ever given me
a gift of lace before,

45:37.610 --> 45:39.779
so thank you for this.

45:41.906 --> 45:44.492
The idea
of making college free

45:44.659 --> 45:47.829
and not sending 22-year-olds
into a debtors' prison...

45:50.165 --> 45:53.501
was something I could definitely
take back to the United States.

45:53.668 --> 45:57.172
I asked for a meeting
with the president of Slovenia.

45:57.338 --> 46:00.425
And, strangely enough,
they gave me one.

46:00.592 --> 46:03.011
- How are you today? Welcome.
- Thank you.

46:03.178 --> 46:04.179
- How are you?
- It's such a pleasure.

46:04.345 --> 46:06.931
No, it's an honor to meet you.
Thank you for seeing me.

46:18.151 --> 46:20.737
The president
was happy to meet with me,

46:20.904 --> 46:23.364
but he ordered my crew
out of the room

46:23.531 --> 46:27.202
because he did not want
any witnesses to his surrender.

46:52.060 --> 46:54.562
Thank you so much.

47:00.193 --> 47:02.487
See how easy that was?

47:02.654 --> 47:03.863
Success.

47:04.030 --> 47:09.410
No casualties, no P.T.S.D.,
no Dick Cheney.

47:09.577 --> 47:13.748
Just me walking away
with something better than oil.

47:13.915 --> 47:16.376
I've just met with
the President of Slovakia...

47:16.543 --> 47:18.336
...and he has surrendered

47:18.503 --> 47:20.171
to the United States.

47:20.338 --> 47:22.340
I have invaded your country,
essentially,

47:22.507 --> 47:24.884
to take this incredible idea

47:25.051 --> 47:28.054
that all college
should be free for everyone.

47:28.221 --> 47:29.889
Thank you.

47:31.683 --> 47:35.436
Germany.

47:40.984 --> 47:43.278
With no student loans to pay off,

47:43.444 --> 47:45.822
imagine then going
into the real world

47:45.989 --> 47:50.410
and getting a job where you
only work 36 hours a week,

47:50.577 --> 47:52.829
but got paid for 40,

47:52.996 --> 47:58.126
a place where you can still find
a thriving middle class,

47:58.293 --> 48:02.505
even amongst people
who make pencils.

48:06.634 --> 48:08.314
We are producing pencils.

48:08.469 --> 48:09.762
- Pencils?
- It's still a good business.

48:09.929 --> 48:11.264
- We start in 17-- still, yes.
- Still?

48:11.431 --> 48:12.515
Even with computers
and everything?

48:12.682 --> 48:13.842
They're still buying pencils.

48:13.933 --> 48:15.653
And, by the way, last year
was the best year

48:15.810 --> 48:18.646
in producing pencils
in Germany ever.

48:18.813 --> 48:20.293
Where are the pencil factories?

48:20.398 --> 48:22.609
The pencil factory is this here,
around us.

48:22.775 --> 48:24.319
- Right behind us?
- Yeah, yeah, those factories.

48:24.485 --> 48:26.362
No, no, no, no.
These aren't factories.

48:26.529 --> 48:29.741
- They have windows.
- What do you mean, windows?

48:29.908 --> 48:31.409
Factories don't have windows.

48:31.576 --> 48:33.494
Doch.
Of course we have windows.

48:33.661 --> 48:35.288
They must have good light.

48:35.455 --> 48:36.539
What do they need sunlight for?

48:36.706 --> 48:38.124
They're just making pencils.

48:38.291 --> 48:39.334
Yeah, but good pencils

48:39.500 --> 48:41.502
and also to feel better,
not to get sick.

48:41.669 --> 48:45.298
Because if you have workers who are ill,
then you have problems.

48:45.465 --> 48:47.258
We don't want that.

48:49.469 --> 48:50.637
I opened a door...

48:50.803 --> 48:52.013
Hello.

48:52.180 --> 48:54.515
...and found something
that was missing in America.

48:54.682 --> 48:56.100
The middle class.

48:56.267 --> 48:57.507
What's everybody doing in here?

49:00.480 --> 49:01.856
You're on a break?

49:02.023 --> 49:04.859
You only work
36 hours a week as it is!

49:06.653 --> 49:09.364
How many of you
have a second or third job?

49:10.990 --> 49:13.743
Nobody.

49:15.370 --> 49:17.080
You're laughing
like that's a funny idea.

49:28.299 --> 49:31.177
You leave here at 2:00 PM.
You're home at 2:30.

49:31.344 --> 49:33.262
What do you do
with all this free time?

49:37.308 --> 49:39.560
And do what?

49:39.727 --> 49:41.270
- Nothing.
- Nothing?

49:56.911 --> 49:59.247
In Germany, work is work.

49:59.414 --> 50:03.751
And when work is over,
work is done.

50:03.918 --> 50:06.129
In fact, they're so concerned
that the workplace

50:06.295 --> 50:08.756
has created so much stress

50:08.923 --> 50:11.926
that under the German
universal health care system,

50:12.093 --> 50:16.764
any stressed-out German can get
their doctor to write a prescription

50:16.931 --> 50:20.101
for a free three-week stay
at a spa.

50:44.959 --> 50:47.754
You don't have to cook,
you don't have to wash.

50:47.920 --> 50:51.466
I need time for me.
I need more time for my children.

50:51.632 --> 50:55.303
We have massage,
gymnastics, then we go to the pool

50:55.470 --> 50:56.721
and we eat healthy.

50:56.888 --> 50:58.431
It's very yummy.

50:58.598 --> 51:00.478
I don't understand
why the government does this.

51:00.641 --> 51:03.561
Because it's cheaper.
In the long run, it's cheaper.

51:03.728 --> 51:06.355
Definitely.
To prevent worse sickness.

51:06.522 --> 51:07.648
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

51:07.815 --> 51:10.318
So, it makes sense
to pay before.

51:10.485 --> 51:11.903
And what about the kids also?

51:12.070 --> 51:14.489
Yeah, well,
some kids get massage and--

51:14.655 --> 51:17.325
- The kids get massage?
- Yeah, yep.

51:17.492 --> 51:19.160
Yeah.

51:19.327 --> 51:22.455
- We really like it.
- We are in paradise here.

51:31.047 --> 51:34.884
If everybody takes
a little bit care of the neighbor,

51:35.051 --> 51:37.345
life is more easy for everyone.

51:37.512 --> 51:40.014
It's just common sense.

51:47.188 --> 51:48.948
One of the reasons
that German workers

51:49.107 --> 51:52.193
have all this free time
and other benefits

51:52.360 --> 51:55.279
is because they have power.

51:55.446 --> 51:56.656
Real power.

51:56.823 --> 52:02.036
It's a law that companies
have to have a supervisory board

52:02.203 --> 52:06.374
which consists
50% representatives

52:06.541 --> 52:08.960
from the workers' side.

52:09.127 --> 52:10.628
That's right.

52:10.795 --> 52:14.298
Not a token worker on the board.

52:14.465 --> 52:18.386
Half of these boards are workers.

52:20.179 --> 52:24.058
And one of the good things about having
workers with power on the board

52:24.225 --> 52:26.435
is that when the company
breaks the law...

52:26.602 --> 52:27.687
End of the road.

52:27.854 --> 52:29.564
Volkswagen, the world's
largest automaker,

52:29.730 --> 52:32.650
was busted for cheating
its way around the law.

52:32.817 --> 52:36.737
...the workers make sure
the company is prosecuted.

52:36.904 --> 52:41.200
That's why companies
listen to the workers.

52:41.367 --> 52:43.744
We ask our employees,
"What can we do better?"

52:43.911 --> 52:46.414
Why? You're in charge.
You're management.

52:46.581 --> 52:48.207
Just tell them what to do.

52:48.374 --> 52:50.668
They observe what we are doing

52:50.835 --> 52:52.879
and they make proposals,
what we can do better.

52:53.045 --> 52:55.256
Do you ever adopt
any of the workers' proposals?

52:55.423 --> 52:57.967
Yes, of course.
We do it regularly.

52:58.134 --> 53:00.595
- Of course.
- Why? Just to keep them happy, or...?

53:00.761 --> 53:02.221
No, no, they have good ideas.

53:02.388 --> 53:04.599
- They have good ideas?
- They have good ideas.

53:04.765 --> 53:06.142
- They know--
- You don't really mean that.

53:06.309 --> 53:08.019
Of course.
It's true.

53:08.186 --> 53:09.770
You're just saying that
'cause the camera's on.

53:09.937 --> 53:12.064
No, no, no. They are so important
and so intelligent.

53:12.231 --> 53:14.817
Believe me, it's--
it's the key to success.

53:14.984 --> 53:18.112
We know that the more
you give people a say,

53:18.279 --> 53:20.823
the more they help
the company to win.

53:20.990 --> 53:24.577
The latest area that
German workers have advocated for

53:24.744 --> 53:27.622
is how they're to be treated
during their free time

53:27.788 --> 53:29.624
when they're not at work.

53:29.790 --> 53:33.127
It is against the law in Germany
to contact an employee

53:33.294 --> 53:36.297
while he or she is on vacation.

53:36.464 --> 53:39.133
And now many companies in Germany
have adopted the rule

53:39.300 --> 53:44.805
that the company cannot send an e-mail
to employees after work.

53:44.972 --> 53:47.099
At Mercedes,
the company's computers

53:47.266 --> 53:51.771
will block any boss who tries
to bother an employee at home.

53:55.191 --> 53:58.819
Employees have
the right not to answer e-mails,

53:58.986 --> 54:04.700
and bosses are not supposed
to intervene on the weekends

54:04.867 --> 54:08.579
or in the vacation or after
normal working hours a day

54:08.746 --> 54:11.666
into the private spheres
of employees.

54:11.832 --> 54:14.085
Ah!

54:14.252 --> 54:17.797
No, the Germans
don't want to interfere

54:17.964 --> 54:19.882
with your private sphere.

54:20.049 --> 54:23.302
But things weren't always
like this in Germany.

54:23.469 --> 54:27.807
Here in Nuremberg,
they didn't just make pencils.

54:27.974 --> 54:30.977
They made documentaries.

56:15.373 --> 56:18.918
My duty is to make a future

56:19.085 --> 56:21.796
without such things.

56:21.962 --> 56:26.634
To make everything that
this is never possible again.

56:26.801 --> 56:28.219
Or to do everything.

56:31.138 --> 56:35.309
Every day in Germany,
in every school,

56:35.476 --> 56:40.231
they teach the young
what their predecessors did.

56:40.398 --> 56:42.149
We had the chance
to meet survivors

56:42.316 --> 56:44.527
and they told us their stories.

56:44.693 --> 56:47.363
And, yeah,
you can't forget it.

56:48.989 --> 56:50.825
They don't whitewash it.

56:50.991 --> 56:53.702
They don't pretend
it didn't happen.

56:53.869 --> 56:57.331
They don't say,
"Hey, that was before my time.

56:57.498 --> 56:59.500
What's this got to do with me?

56:59.667 --> 57:01.669
I didn't kill anyone."

57:03.170 --> 57:05.131
I just adopted
the German nationality,

57:05.297 --> 57:09.969
and I think by my adopting
the German nationality,

57:10.136 --> 57:13.180
I have to adopt the history
of Germans, too,

57:13.347 --> 57:16.642
and also feel responsible
for the things a German did

57:16.809 --> 57:18.144
because I'm German, too.

57:19.937 --> 57:22.690
They treat it as their original sin,

57:22.857 --> 57:25.860
a permanent mark
on their collective German soul,

57:26.026 --> 57:29.029
one for which they must always
seek redemption

57:29.196 --> 57:33.868
and make reparation
and never forget.

57:35.953 --> 57:38.706
And they can't forget,

57:38.873 --> 57:43.377
because outside of their homes
on the sidewalk

57:43.544 --> 57:46.130
are little engravings
that remind them

57:46.297 --> 57:48.466
of the name
of the Jewish family

57:48.632 --> 57:50.968
that used to live in this house,

57:51.135 --> 57:53.387
but was taken away and killed.

57:56.557 --> 57:59.351
Local artists
have installed around town

57:59.518 --> 58:02.897
the "Jews Forbidden" signs
from the 1930s...

58:09.195 --> 58:11.238
...to remind today's generation

58:11.405 --> 58:16.076
that to be German isn't just
about Beethoven and Bach...

58:17.786 --> 58:21.457
but also about
genocide and evil.

58:22.917 --> 58:25.169
What would our signs look like?

58:38.265 --> 58:40.809
What would our classes teach

58:40.976 --> 58:43.395
if we wanted to teach our young

58:43.562 --> 58:47.024
the whole story
of what it means to be American?

58:48.776 --> 58:51.612
What reparations
would we make?

58:52.988 --> 58:57.576
Have we truly changed?

58:57.743 --> 59:03.415
Until 2015, the United States
never had a museum of slavery.

59:04.625 --> 59:07.127
Why do we hide from our sins?

59:08.295 --> 59:10.631
The first step to recovery,

59:10.798 --> 59:15.135
the first step to being a better person
or a better country

59:15.302 --> 59:20.558
is to be able to just stand up
and honestly say who and what you are.

59:22.393 --> 59:24.645
"I am an American.

59:24.812 --> 59:29.567
I live in a great country
that was born in genocide

59:29.733 --> 59:32.820
and built on the backs of slaves."

59:38.492 --> 59:41.328
If there's one thing we should
steal from the Germans,

59:41.495 --> 59:44.748
it's the idea that if you
acknowledge your dark side

59:44.915 --> 59:47.001
and make amends for it,

59:47.167 --> 59:51.130
you can free yourself
to be a better people

59:51.297 --> 59:53.757
and to do well by others.

59:55.175 --> 59:58.804
If they can do it,
surely we can.

01:00:38.761 --> 01:00:42.139
My invasion across Europe
continued.

01:00:42.306 --> 01:00:45.684
The next stop was Portugal,

01:00:45.851 --> 01:00:49.647
the country that helped
to bring slavery to the Americas.

01:00:49.813 --> 01:00:53.609
After a few hundred years,
they gave up the slave trade,

01:00:53.776 --> 01:00:56.362
but they kept the slaves' drums.

01:01:00.532 --> 01:01:04.536
Somehow, the Portuguese
had caught wind of my invasion.

01:01:10.918 --> 01:01:13.128
But of course this was May Day,

01:01:13.295 --> 01:01:16.882
a celebration of workers
held all over the world.

01:01:17.049 --> 01:01:20.177
In some countries,
it's a day off work.

01:01:20.344 --> 01:01:22.805
But not in the United States.

01:01:39.613 --> 01:01:41.949
Portugal, like most countries,

01:01:42.116 --> 01:01:44.660
had a war on drugs.

01:01:44.827 --> 01:01:49.123
And, like most countries,
they were losing that war.

01:01:49.289 --> 01:01:51.959
So they decided to try
something new.

01:01:54.628 --> 01:01:56.868
It's my understanding
that you don't arrest people

01:01:56.922 --> 01:01:59.299
for using drugs anymore.

01:01:59.466 --> 01:02:00.926
No?

01:02:01.093 --> 01:02:05.055
Heroin? Pot? Meth?
Pills? Nothing?

01:02:06.306 --> 01:02:08.183
If I told you I had cocaine
on me right now,

01:02:08.350 --> 01:02:09.977
you wouldn't do anything?

01:02:11.103 --> 01:02:12.980
- No? Okay.
- No.

01:02:13.147 --> 01:02:16.650
Officers, I have cocaine
in my pocket.

01:02:16.817 --> 01:02:19.570
A whole bunch of it.

01:02:19.737 --> 01:02:22.823
Sorry, ahem, allergies.

01:02:25.033 --> 01:02:27.995
I found my way to the offices
of Portugal's...

01:02:28.162 --> 01:02:30.789
well, I don't know
what they call this guy.

01:02:30.956 --> 01:02:32.875
I guess he's some sort
of drug czar.

01:02:33.041 --> 01:02:35.169
Nuno Capaz.

01:02:35.335 --> 01:02:36.837
You know, you look like a drug user.

01:02:37.004 --> 01:02:39.757
Yeah, people told me that before.
I know that.

01:02:39.923 --> 01:02:42.426
It's-- well, it helps me relate to them,
so I'm okay with that.

01:02:42.593 --> 01:02:44.219
- You don't care?
- I don't care. No, not really.

01:02:44.386 --> 01:02:46.013
Right.
Are you a drug user?

01:02:46.180 --> 01:02:48.223
Yes, I am.
Yes, I am.

01:02:48.390 --> 01:02:49.475
What drugs do you use?

01:02:49.641 --> 01:02:54.980
Well, mostly alcohol,
Internet, a lot of coffee,

01:02:55.147 --> 01:02:58.192
some sugar,
sex, occasionally.

01:02:58.358 --> 01:03:01.195
Well, a lot of things
that make me feel good.

01:03:01.361 --> 01:03:04.865
How many people last year
went to prison for using drugs?

01:03:05.032 --> 01:03:06.825
For using drugs?
Zero.

01:03:06.992 --> 01:03:08.869
How many people went to prison
two years ago for using drugs?

01:03:09.036 --> 01:03:10.329
- Zero.
- Five years ago?

01:03:10.496 --> 01:03:13.540
In the last 15 years,
no one was arrested in Portugal

01:03:13.707 --> 01:03:15.417
because they were caught
using drugs.

01:03:15.584 --> 01:03:16.794
- No one?
- No.

01:03:16.960 --> 01:03:19.630
It's not considered a crime,
so there's no legal possibility

01:03:19.797 --> 01:03:23.133
of someone getting
a jail sentence out of it.

01:03:23.300 --> 01:03:26.929
So, if I had 25 joints on me,
I would be considered a user.

01:03:27.095 --> 01:03:29.807
Mm-hmm, yeah.
Yes.

01:03:29.973 --> 01:03:33.310
Have you had an increase
in drug-related crimes as a result of...

01:03:33.477 --> 01:03:36.563
No. If there's less people using,
there will be less people

01:03:36.730 --> 01:03:38.357
causing troubles
because they are using.

01:03:38.524 --> 01:03:39.566
Okay, wait a minute.

01:03:39.733 --> 01:03:42.694
You're saying that
by decriminalizing all drugs,

01:03:42.861 --> 01:03:47.241
not throwing people in jail,
drug usage went down, not up?

01:03:47.407 --> 01:03:49.076
Mm-hmm.

01:03:50.244 --> 01:03:53.288
Um...

01:03:56.792 --> 01:03:58.312
When you think about drug users,

01:03:58.377 --> 01:04:03.257
everybody thinks about those
small 10% that are causing problems.

01:04:03.423 --> 01:04:05.509
People don't think about
the 90% of people

01:04:05.676 --> 01:04:07.177
that are not causing
any troubles

01:04:07.344 --> 01:04:09.596
although they are using
illicit substances.

01:04:10.597 --> 01:04:13.350
People that are using drugs
might be causing harm...

01:04:13.517 --> 01:04:16.077
Causing harm to themselves,
but not necessarily to others.

01:04:16.103 --> 01:04:17.563
...but not necessarily to others.

01:04:17.729 --> 01:04:19.940
I mean, they may be bringing sadness
to their marriage or their family or...

01:04:20.107 --> 01:04:23.026
So? So does Facebook.

01:04:23.193 --> 01:04:24.820
Are we going to illegalize it?

01:04:26.029 --> 01:04:28.282
See, we think of it the other way.

01:04:28.448 --> 01:04:31.451
By identifying those
who are using and doing drugs,

01:04:31.618 --> 01:04:34.079
we can weed them out.

01:04:34.246 --> 01:04:37.916
- We use that as the crime--
- Is it working?

01:04:38.083 --> 01:04:42.296
Well, actually, it is.

01:04:45.132 --> 01:04:46.675
It's probably just a coincidence,

01:04:46.842 --> 01:04:49.761
but in the 1950s and '60s,

01:04:49.928 --> 01:04:54.391
the Negroes of the United States,
after 400 years of oppression,

01:04:54.558 --> 01:04:58.437
got all uppity and started
demanding their civil rights.

01:04:58.604 --> 01:05:00.814
And they started
to assert their power.

01:05:06.737 --> 01:05:09.489
Our people want an end

01:05:09.656 --> 01:05:11.366
to the living hell

01:05:11.533 --> 01:05:14.161
that drug-pushing has spawned.

01:05:14.328 --> 01:05:16.663
In order to fight
and defeat this enemy,

01:05:16.830 --> 01:05:20.876
it is necessary to wage
a new, all-out offensive.

01:05:21.043 --> 01:05:22.044
- Down.
- On the ground.

01:05:22.210 --> 01:05:23.545
On the ground, man.

01:05:23.712 --> 01:05:24.838
On the ground.

01:05:25.005 --> 01:05:27.591
This is one area where
we cannot have budget cuts.

01:05:27.758 --> 01:05:29.843
Drugs are menacing
our society.

01:05:30.010 --> 01:05:32.971
They're threatening our values
and undercutting our institutions.

01:05:33.138 --> 01:05:34.818
Here's how I think
the history books

01:05:34.890 --> 01:05:38.393
will record all of this
100 years from now.

01:05:38.560 --> 01:05:41.188
"Around the time that the blacks
began to rise up,

01:05:41.355 --> 01:05:45.192
coincidentally, new laws were passed
imposing harsher sentences

01:05:45.359 --> 01:05:48.737
on the drugs that were created
for the 'urban' demographic"...

01:05:48.904 --> 01:05:50.697
See this cute little vial here?

01:05:50.864 --> 01:05:52.491
It's crack, rock cocaine.

01:05:52.658 --> 01:05:54.368
This is crack cocaine.

01:05:54.534 --> 01:05:56.495
..."while the drugs used
in the white community

01:05:56.662 --> 01:05:58.956
resulted in lesser punishments."

01:05:59.122 --> 01:06:01.500
So help me God.

01:06:01.667 --> 01:06:05.837
I experimented with marijuana
a time or two and I didn't like it,

01:06:06.004 --> 01:06:08.256
and didn't inhale,
and never tried it again.

01:06:16.390 --> 01:06:20.227
"Their leaders assassinated,
the uprising grew quiet,

01:06:20.394 --> 01:06:22.229
and over the next four decades,

01:06:22.396 --> 01:06:27.901
the police coincidentally rounded up
millions upon millions of black men,

01:06:28.068 --> 01:06:30.988
stripping from all of them
their right to vote,

01:06:31.154 --> 01:06:33.907
with 35 states
not even letting them vote

01:06:34.074 --> 01:06:36.243
after they get out of prison.

01:06:36.410 --> 01:06:40.580
Which means that in states
like Florida and Virginia,

01:06:40.747 --> 01:06:43.500
one in three black men
cannot vote."

01:06:43.667 --> 01:06:47.587
When we fight drugs,
we fight the war on terror.

01:06:47.754 --> 01:06:49.339
"And the way you get the states

01:06:49.506 --> 01:06:52.426
with the largest percentage
of terrorists

01:06:52.592 --> 01:06:54.302
to become red states

01:06:54.469 --> 01:06:57.139
is by taking away
their right to vote."

01:07:00.600 --> 01:07:02.853
Yes, white America
had inadvertently

01:07:03.020 --> 01:07:06.106
figured out a way
to bring back slavery.

01:07:06.273 --> 01:07:09.735
And master knew
that the way to get rich

01:07:09.901 --> 01:07:13.280
was having all that free labor.

01:07:14.364 --> 01:07:17.200
Today's masters
have found our prisons

01:07:17.367 --> 01:07:20.787
to be the perfect places
to make their products

01:07:20.954 --> 01:07:24.332
for as little as 23 cents an hour.

01:07:25.459 --> 01:07:29.963
Yes, that burger you're eating,
that airline reservation you've made,

01:07:30.130 --> 01:07:34.426
the software you're using to watch
the pirated copy of this movie,

01:07:34.593 --> 01:07:37.637
your child's backpack
with its five hours of homework.

01:07:37.804 --> 01:07:40.807
I always wondered
what Victoria's secret was.

01:07:40.974 --> 01:07:42.476
And now I know.

01:07:42.642 --> 01:07:48.315
It's one of many companies
that have used 21st century slaves.

01:07:51.485 --> 01:07:55.614
It was an act of pure,
mad genius.

01:07:57.657 --> 01:07:59.497
So, what do you do
with your black people here?

01:07:59.618 --> 01:08:00.994
- Do you have black people here?
- Yep.

01:08:01.161 --> 01:08:03.830
And you don't-- you don't have
drug laws to put them in prison.

01:08:03.997 --> 01:08:05.624
No, no.

01:08:05.791 --> 01:08:06.792
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:08:06.958 --> 01:08:10.128
You're telling me that if you arrested
someone who was black

01:08:10.295 --> 01:08:13.423
for usage of drugs,
they wouldn't go to prison?

01:08:13.590 --> 01:08:15.967
They wouldn't be arrested
in the first place.

01:08:16.134 --> 01:08:18.428
The usage of drugs
is not an excuse

01:08:18.595 --> 01:08:21.473
to arrest anyone in Portugal,
regardless of their color.

01:08:21.640 --> 01:08:23.975
Right, but it's a way
to help control the population,

01:08:24.142 --> 01:08:26.019
if you understand what I'm saying.

01:08:26.185 --> 01:08:28.313
- In the US, we have millions...
- I know.

01:08:28.479 --> 01:08:30.357
...of black, mostly men...

01:08:30.524 --> 01:08:32.067
With a criminal record,
and it's--

01:08:32.234 --> 01:08:33.401
Even though they're out of prison.

01:08:33.568 --> 01:08:34.944
And they can't ever vote again.

01:08:35.112 --> 01:08:38.031
Our prisoners actually vote first.

01:08:38.198 --> 01:08:41.368
I'm here right now
to steal your great idea.

01:08:41.535 --> 01:08:43.828
I'm gonna take it back
to the United States.

01:08:43.995 --> 01:08:48.834
The thing is it won't work
if you just take it there and pfft.

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:52.129
If you just go there and you just
decriminalize drug usage,

01:08:52.295 --> 01:08:53.546
that's not going to work.

01:08:53.712 --> 01:08:56.299
You have to steal some other good ideas
that we had before.

01:08:56.466 --> 01:08:57.551
Yeah?
Like what?

01:08:57.716 --> 01:09:00.554
A health care system
that is universal and free for all.

01:09:00.720 --> 01:09:03.974
That will increase
the accessibility to treatment.

01:09:04.140 --> 01:09:05.850
So, what you're saying is
it's not just taking back

01:09:06.017 --> 01:09:08.645
the criminalization
part of drugs,

01:09:08.812 --> 01:09:11.022
I am also gonna have
to convince the United States

01:09:11.189 --> 01:09:12.983
to increase treatment,

01:09:13.149 --> 01:09:16.403
basically take the stick out of our ass,
and help people.

01:09:16.569 --> 01:09:17.946
Exactly.

01:09:43.095 --> 01:09:44.576
As we were packing up to leave,

01:09:44.723 --> 01:09:48.310
the Lisbon cops asked
if they could say something directly

01:09:48.475 --> 01:09:51.688
to law enforcement
in the United States.

01:10:08.205 --> 01:10:10.749
- Is against that dignity?
- Yeah.

01:10:10.916 --> 01:10:15.712
And you guys are cops
and this is how you feel?

01:10:15.879 --> 01:10:18.340
I don't know what to say.

01:10:19.799 --> 01:10:22.636
A lot of work to be done, yeah.

01:10:27.641 --> 01:10:29.559
- Thank you.
- Thank you very much.

01:10:56.086 --> 01:10:57.337
And I think in general...

01:11:14.688 --> 01:11:15.855
Yeah.

01:11:16.022 --> 01:11:17.399
Yeah.

01:11:19.067 --> 01:11:22.195
Welcome to the Norwegian
prison system,

01:11:22.362 --> 01:11:27.117
based on the principle
of rehabilitation, not revenge.

01:11:27.284 --> 01:11:28.743
I want to meet prisoners.

01:11:28.910 --> 01:11:30.510
- Yeah, you wanna meet prisoners?
- Yeah.

01:11:30.620 --> 01:11:31.830
You're meeting one now.

01:11:31.997 --> 01:11:33.873
You're-- you're a prisoner,
dressed like this?

01:11:34.040 --> 01:11:35.208
Yes.

01:11:38.712 --> 01:11:43.967
So, this is the house
and in here is the living room.

01:11:44.134 --> 01:11:46.970
It's a nice, okay view.

01:11:49.055 --> 01:11:51.016
And this is my room.

01:11:51.182 --> 01:11:52.559
It's pretty okay.

01:11:52.726 --> 01:11:54.686
Yeah, so, this is your cell.

01:11:54.853 --> 01:11:56.396
Yes.

01:11:56.563 --> 01:11:57.731
Do they lock you in at night?

01:11:57.897 --> 01:12:01.818
No. I am the only one
that has the key for it, so...

01:12:06.990 --> 01:12:08.908
We watch TV,
we can play basketball.

01:12:09.075 --> 01:12:12.620
- Bicycle or running, swimming.
- Fishing.

01:12:12.787 --> 01:12:14.789
Wait a minute.
What do you mean swimming?

01:12:14.956 --> 01:12:16.458
You can swim
to the other side?

01:12:16.624 --> 01:12:18.084
That is not allowed.

01:12:18.251 --> 01:12:19.794
From another side,
you can swim here,

01:12:19.961 --> 01:12:22.172
but you cannot swim from here
to another side.

01:12:22.339 --> 01:12:26.092
Because they call escape.

01:12:26.259 --> 01:12:28.303
- You're in prison for murder.
- Yeah.

01:12:28.470 --> 01:12:31.222
- You killed somebody.
- Yeah.

01:12:31.389 --> 01:12:33.933
I can't help but notice
that right behind you

01:12:34.100 --> 01:12:35.685
are a whole bunch
of very sharp knives.

01:12:35.852 --> 01:12:37.771
Yeah.

01:12:37.937 --> 01:12:39.022
Yes.

01:12:39.189 --> 01:12:41.608
- Nobody here is worried about that?
- No, no.

01:12:41.775 --> 01:12:43.443
- Should I be worried about that?
- No.

01:12:43.610 --> 01:12:45.987
- You're not worried about it.
- I'm not worried about it.

01:12:57.749 --> 01:12:59.793
- I love this.
- Yeah.

01:12:59.959 --> 01:13:02.253
If I could get one of these
to take home,

01:13:02.420 --> 01:13:04.631
I would have ketchup
on everything.

01:13:04.798 --> 01:13:07.175
That is, like, the cool--
look at it, it's still going.

01:13:07.342 --> 01:13:09.552
Yeah.

01:13:09.719 --> 01:13:12.931
In the weekend,
it's four guards at work

01:13:13.098 --> 01:13:14.349
in another building.

01:13:14.516 --> 01:13:16.101
- That's it?
- Yeah, that's it.

01:13:16.267 --> 01:13:18.019
And how many of you
are there here?

01:13:18.186 --> 01:13:21.439
- 115.
- 115 and four guards?

01:13:21.606 --> 01:13:23.149
- Yeah.
- Wow.

01:13:25.485 --> 01:13:27.487
Warden, where's the punishment?

01:13:27.654 --> 01:13:29.447
Where is the punishment?

01:13:29.614 --> 01:13:35.203
The main idea is we're just supposed
to take away their freedom.

01:13:35.370 --> 01:13:37.997
That's the only punishment
we're actually giving them.

01:13:38.164 --> 01:13:40.166
They miss their family,
they miss their friends.

01:13:40.333 --> 01:13:42.001
Right, right.

01:13:42.168 --> 01:13:44.712
But also I think and I hope
when you speak to them,

01:13:44.879 --> 01:13:46.673
they will also feel
that we're trying to help them

01:13:46.840 --> 01:13:48.800
back to the same society.

01:13:48.967 --> 01:13:51.803
You know, this is gonna be very hard
for Americans to see this.

01:13:51.970 --> 01:13:55.682
This looks very strange to understand
why you're doing it,

01:13:55.849 --> 01:13:58.977
why you do
your prison system this way.

01:14:15.034 --> 01:14:17.954
We have to show more love
and affection for each other,

01:14:18.121 --> 01:14:21.374
to take care of each other
in another way.

01:14:21.541 --> 01:14:22.625
- This is the way.
- Yeah.

01:14:22.792 --> 01:14:24.669
This is a sense of life,
you know?

01:14:24.836 --> 01:14:26.254
If we showed a little more
love and affection

01:14:26.421 --> 01:14:27.741
and kindness toward each other...

01:14:27.881 --> 01:14:29.466
Yeah, yeah.

01:14:29.632 --> 01:14:32.343
This is the way.
And this is so important.

01:14:32.510 --> 01:14:35.221
- So important.
- Yeah.

01:14:35.388 --> 01:14:39.559
The U.S. has one of the highest
recidivism rates in the world.

01:14:39.726 --> 01:14:44.063
Nearly 80% of prisoners
are re-arrested within five years.

01:14:44.230 --> 01:14:49.068
Norway has
one of the lowest, at 20%.

01:14:50.987 --> 01:14:55.492
And that was something
I was claiming for the U.S.A.

01:14:55.658 --> 01:14:58.620
Of course, I was visiting
a model prison.

01:14:58.786 --> 01:15:01.789
A place for inmates
who were being rewarded

01:15:01.956 --> 01:15:03.833
for their good behavior.

01:15:06.461 --> 01:15:10.965
I said it wasn't fair to show
the American public their nicest place.

01:15:11.132 --> 01:15:15.386
I wanted to see
a maximum security facility.

01:15:17.096 --> 01:15:19.432
And that's where I went.

01:15:20.600 --> 01:15:23.478
When the prison
first opened in 2010,

01:15:23.645 --> 01:15:25.772
the guards wanted to send
a strong message

01:15:25.939 --> 01:15:27.607
to the new inmates,

01:15:27.774 --> 01:15:30.485
so they made
this orientation video.

01:15:53.841 --> 01:15:56.469
 There comes a time 

01:15:56.636 --> 01:15:59.681
 When we heed a certain call 

01:15:59.847 --> 01:16:05.144
 When the world
must come together as one 

01:16:06.145 --> 01:16:09.440
 There are people dyin' 

01:16:09.607 --> 01:16:12.902
 And it's time to lend a hand 

01:16:13.069 --> 01:16:19.534
 To live, the greatest gift of all 

01:16:19.701 --> 01:16:22.537
 We can't go on 

01:16:22.704 --> 01:16:25.665
 Pretending day by day 

01:16:25.832 --> 01:16:32.171
 That someone somewhere
will soon make a change... 

01:16:32.338 --> 01:16:35.216
Is that braille?
For the blind?

01:16:35.383 --> 01:16:37.010
Yeah.
For the blind, yes, yes.

01:16:37.176 --> 01:16:40.680
It's art.
Modern art.

01:16:41.931 --> 01:16:44.684
You have modern art
throughout the prison here?

01:16:44.851 --> 01:16:47.729
 We are the world 

01:16:47.895 --> 01:16:51.107
 We are the children 

01:16:51.274 --> 01:16:54.027
 We are the ones
who make a brighter day 

01:16:54.193 --> 01:16:58.031
 So let's start givin' 

01:16:58.197 --> 01:17:01.326
 There's a choice we're making 

01:17:01.492 --> 01:17:04.829
 We're saving our own lives 

01:17:04.996 --> 01:17:10.126
 It's true we'll make a better day,
just you and me... 

01:17:11.836 --> 01:17:12.879
How many fights have you been in?

01:17:13.046 --> 01:17:15.590
I have never been in fights,
actually.

01:17:15.757 --> 01:17:17.717
You don't need a knife
to protect yourself with?

01:17:17.884 --> 01:17:19.260
- Oh, no, no, no.
- No?

01:17:19.427 --> 01:17:21.387
- We don't need that.
- No.

01:17:21.554 --> 01:17:23.389
Show me your wounds,
the number of times you've been stabbed.

01:17:23.556 --> 01:17:24.891
- Oh, no, never.
- Never been stabbed.

01:17:25.058 --> 01:17:26.225
I've never been stabbed.

01:17:26.392 --> 01:17:27.560
How many times have you
been beaten up here

01:17:27.727 --> 01:17:29.062
- by other prisoners?
- No, never.

01:17:29.228 --> 01:17:30.563
How many times you've been
raped in the shower?

01:17:30.730 --> 01:17:32.732
Never.
That's not gonna happen

01:17:32.899 --> 01:17:34.139
because you got
your own shower.

01:17:38.071 --> 01:17:39.197
Yeah, here's the bed.

01:17:39.364 --> 01:17:41.699
Mm-kay, that's a bed. TV.

01:17:41.866 --> 01:17:43.910
- Got the flat-screen TV.
- Mm-hmm.

01:17:48.706 --> 01:17:52.085
I'm painting, and besides that,
I'm studying art class, you know.

01:17:52.251 --> 01:17:53.731
You're taking philosophy class?

01:17:53.878 --> 01:17:55.713
I'm gonna have exam
after summer.

01:17:55.880 --> 01:17:59.217
I want to work with community problems
and things like that.

01:17:59.384 --> 01:18:01.886
Maybe politics later on.

01:18:02.053 --> 01:18:03.680
That's not a bad idea.

01:18:03.846 --> 01:18:06.933
Go to prison first,
then become a politician.

01:18:08.685 --> 01:18:10.436
And speaking of politicians,

01:18:10.603 --> 01:18:14.941
as in Portugal,
prisoners in Norway can vote.

01:18:15.108 --> 01:18:17.527
And in order
to get their votes,

01:18:17.694 --> 01:18:20.446
candidates show up
for election debates,

01:18:20.613 --> 01:18:24.158
televised live
from inside the prison.

01:18:30.623 --> 01:18:32.625
I had to keep reminding myself

01:18:32.792 --> 01:18:35.628
this was a maximum
security facility.

01:18:36.796 --> 01:18:39.757
Here, the inmates have keys, too.

01:18:39.924 --> 01:18:42.593
And this inmate was a murderer.

01:18:42.760 --> 01:18:46.431
They had Xboxes and a library

01:18:46.597 --> 01:18:50.518
as nice as any suburban
high school library in the U.S.

01:18:53.396 --> 01:18:55.940
They even had
their own record label

01:18:56.107 --> 01:18:58.443
and a recording studio.

01:19:05.575 --> 01:19:09.996
Music can actually open
a lot of the creativity inside of them.

01:19:10.163 --> 01:19:13.499
And if it's one thing that's said
about the guys here,

01:19:13.666 --> 01:19:16.961
they are very creative
in all sorts of ways.

01:19:23.092 --> 01:19:25.344
They've got their own laundry,

01:19:25.511 --> 01:19:27.472
they've got a pantry,

01:19:27.638 --> 01:19:31.601
and, yes, they've got
their own knives, too.

01:19:31.768 --> 01:19:32.852
Where are your guns?

01:19:33.019 --> 01:19:34.604
- We don't--
- We don't need it.

01:19:34.771 --> 01:19:36.011
- You don't need any guns?
- No.

01:19:36.105 --> 01:19:37.899
We talk to the guys.
That's our weapon.

01:19:38.065 --> 01:19:40.693
- Your weapon is your mouth?
- Yeah.

01:19:40.860 --> 01:19:43.946
When it comes to do the job,
they will do it good, you know,

01:19:44.113 --> 01:19:45.990
because the officers,
they serve you.

01:19:46.157 --> 01:19:48.618
You know,
they're there for you.

01:19:48.785 --> 01:19:50.385
- The guards.
- It's not like in America.

01:19:50.536 --> 01:19:52.296
They're there for--
beat the shit out of you.

01:19:52.413 --> 01:19:55.208
Crawl, motherfucker, crawl!

01:19:55.374 --> 01:19:57.877
This way. Go!

01:19:58.044 --> 01:20:01.088
Get him! Go!

01:20:02.840 --> 01:20:04.967
Don't get bit.
You're gonna get bit.

01:20:05.134 --> 01:20:07.595
Get down and spread!
Get down and spread!

01:20:13.935 --> 01:20:16.771
- Don't move!
- Behave yourselves, behave yourselves.

01:20:31.285 --> 01:20:33.329
This is Trond Blattmann,

01:20:33.496 --> 01:20:35.581
a plumber by trade.

01:20:35.748 --> 01:20:40.711
On July 22nd, 2011,
he lost his 17-year-old son

01:20:40.878 --> 01:20:44.090
when he was murdered
with 54 other teenagers

01:20:44.257 --> 01:20:48.553
on a summer camp island
in a lake in Norway.

01:20:48.719 --> 01:20:52.849
One killer, who espoused
neo-Nazi and racist beliefs,

01:20:53.015 --> 01:20:56.143
not only killed
all of these children,

01:20:56.310 --> 01:20:59.313
but blew up a federal building
in downtown Oslo.

01:21:01.607 --> 01:21:05.152
My son called me
from the island and said,

01:21:05.319 --> 01:21:07.905
"Daddy, Daddy,
there's somebody

01:21:08.072 --> 01:21:11.284
shooting at us on the island.

01:21:11.450 --> 01:21:13.411
What are we gonna do?"

01:21:13.578 --> 01:21:16.058
I had never been on the island,
so I didn't know what he meant,

01:21:16.163 --> 01:21:18.124
and I said, "Are you together
with other people,

01:21:18.291 --> 01:21:19.625
other youngsters? Yes?

01:21:19.792 --> 01:21:23.170
Well, then, hide
and stick together,

01:21:23.337 --> 01:21:24.630
take care of each other,

01:21:24.797 --> 01:21:28.259
and be careful."

01:21:29.427 --> 01:21:31.470
He called me around 5:20

01:21:31.637 --> 01:21:35.057
and he was dead
just past 6:00.

01:21:38.060 --> 01:21:39.520
Do you wish
that your son had a gun

01:21:39.687 --> 01:21:41.647
instead of a cell phone
that day?

01:21:45.443 --> 01:21:50.281
What I wished that he had done
was to swim.

01:21:50.448 --> 01:21:53.284
Because the ones
who swam survived.

01:21:54.535 --> 01:21:56.871
We don't have
death sentences here in Norway,

01:21:57.038 --> 01:21:59.248
so we kind of said,
"That mass murderer,

01:21:59.415 --> 01:22:02.460
he's going to have the same
kind of treatment as everybody else."

01:22:02.627 --> 01:22:05.212
The justice system
is going to judge him

01:22:05.379 --> 01:22:07.256
and he's going to have
his sentence.

01:22:07.423 --> 01:22:08.883
You cared about
whether he had a fair trial.

01:22:09.050 --> 01:22:11.552
- Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
- You. You yourself.

01:22:11.719 --> 01:22:13.888
But don't you personally
want to kill him?

01:22:14.055 --> 01:22:16.349
- No. No.
- If you had the chance?

01:22:16.515 --> 01:22:17.683
- If you had the chance?
- No.

01:22:17.850 --> 01:22:21.354
- But he killed your son.
- Yeah, but I-- no.

01:22:21.520 --> 01:22:23.230
- You don't want to kill him?
- No.

01:22:24.649 --> 01:22:27.526
- But he killed your son.
- Yeah, he killed my son.

01:22:27.693 --> 01:22:29.195
- You wouldn't want to--
- But I don't want to step--

01:22:29.362 --> 01:22:33.866
I don't want to step down
on the ladder and say,

01:22:34.033 --> 01:22:38.871
"I had the same right
as you thought you had to kill."

01:22:39.038 --> 01:22:40.456
I don't have the same right.

01:22:40.623 --> 01:22:42.103
Even though he's just
a piece of scum?

01:22:42.208 --> 01:22:46.128
Yeah, but that's-- I know
he's a piece of scum,

01:22:46.295 --> 01:22:49.173
but it doesn't give me the right
to shoot him or kill him.

01:22:51.217 --> 01:22:53.511
So, after this horrible
act of terrorism,

01:22:53.678 --> 01:22:55.388
Norway didn't change its system.

01:22:55.554 --> 01:22:57.890
You don't try to institute
a Patriot Act.

01:22:58.057 --> 01:22:59.141
No.

01:22:59.308 --> 01:23:00.434
You don't try to take away
people's freedoms.

01:23:00.601 --> 01:23:01.978
No.

01:23:02.144 --> 01:23:03.604
You're cautiously thinking
about arming the police now.

01:23:03.771 --> 01:23:06.482
But even that is bothersome
and worrisome.

01:23:06.649 --> 01:23:10.069
Why didn't you respond
the way we responded after 9/11?

01:23:10.236 --> 01:23:13.239
Well, let me put it this way.

01:23:13.406 --> 01:23:14.907
The whole establishment,

01:23:15.074 --> 01:23:17.994
from the prime minister
through the king's family

01:23:18.160 --> 01:23:21.747
and all of the officials in Norway,

01:23:21.914 --> 01:23:24.542
all of the press,
the media said,

01:23:24.709 --> 01:23:27.294
"Well, let's now
take care of Norway.

01:23:27.461 --> 01:23:29.880
As we have been used
to taking care of each other,

01:23:30.047 --> 01:23:31.173
we take care of Norway.

01:23:31.340 --> 01:23:34.468
So, we stay together,
we open our hearts,

01:23:34.635 --> 01:23:35.928
we open our society.

01:23:36.095 --> 01:23:40.766
We're gonna have more democracy,
more freedom of speech,

01:23:40.933 --> 01:23:44.437
because to lock up
wouldn't help us.

01:23:44.603 --> 01:23:47.314
That would just create
more hatred.

01:23:58.617 --> 01:24:03.914
 It's true, we'll make a better day,
just you and me 

01:24:04.081 --> 01:24:07.126
 We are the world 

01:24:07.293 --> 01:24:10.379
 We are the children 

01:24:10.546 --> 01:24:13.299
 We are the ones
who make a brighter day 

01:24:13.466 --> 01:24:16.969
 So let's start givin' 

01:24:17.136 --> 01:24:20.639
 There's a choice we're makin' 

01:24:20.806 --> 01:24:24.143
 We're savin' our own lives 

01:24:24.310 --> 01:24:26.312
 It's true,
we'll make a better day 

01:24:26.479 --> 01:24:31.067
 Just you and me 

01:24:31.233 --> 01:24:35.112
 It's true,
we'll make a better day 

01:24:35.279 --> 01:24:40.326
 Just you and me. 

01:24:49.460 --> 01:24:51.670
There was much
I took from Norway

01:24:51.837 --> 01:24:54.507
and much more to think about.

01:24:54.673 --> 01:24:57.009
A country that forgave.

01:24:57.176 --> 01:24:59.970
A country that,
when it locked up its citizens,

01:25:00.137 --> 01:25:02.681
it treated them as human beings.

01:25:04.183 --> 01:25:06.268
So what was I to do now?

01:25:06.435 --> 01:25:10.022
Where to invade next?

01:25:12.233 --> 01:25:14.401
Sweden?

01:25:14.568 --> 01:25:16.028
Denmark?

01:25:16.195 --> 01:25:17.905
I could go somewhere else.

01:25:18.072 --> 01:25:20.950
Like Iran

01:25:21.117 --> 01:25:24.078
or Brazil

01:25:24.245 --> 01:25:27.289
or even Rwanda.

01:25:27.456 --> 01:25:30.167
But I chose Tunisia.

01:25:34.713 --> 01:25:37.174
A country
in Muslim North Africa

01:25:37.341 --> 01:25:41.178
that has something
that we don't--

01:25:41.345 --> 01:25:44.557
free government-funded
women's health clinics

01:25:44.723 --> 01:25:46.642
and government-funded abortion.

01:25:51.480 --> 01:25:56.110
We have 24
reproductive health centers in Tunisia

01:25:56.277 --> 01:25:59.488
and it is our main mission--
contraception.

01:25:59.655 --> 01:26:05.494
We have I.U.D.s, pills, implant,
and of course condoms.

01:26:05.661 --> 01:26:08.247
- So, how about abortion?
- Yes, of course.

01:26:08.414 --> 01:26:12.668
In Tunisia, abortion is legal
since 1973.

01:26:12.835 --> 01:26:14.837
And the Tunisian people
are okay with that?

01:26:15.004 --> 01:26:17.590
Yes, because
these kind of services

01:26:17.756 --> 01:26:20.676
help women
to be the equal of men,

01:26:20.843 --> 01:26:23.095
and when a woman
is well-educated,

01:26:23.262 --> 01:26:26.098
when she work,
she have a better quality of life,

01:26:26.265 --> 01:26:29.727
so she will have
a better life expectancy.

01:26:29.894 --> 01:26:34.273
And I think that family planning
has played a great role.

01:26:34.440 --> 01:26:36.775
As in other countries,

01:26:36.942 --> 01:26:39.987
once women had control
over their own bodies,

01:26:40.154 --> 01:26:42.781
eventually
both women and men

01:26:42.948 --> 01:26:45.451
want control
over their own lives.

01:26:45.618 --> 01:26:47.411
And in Tunisia's case,

01:26:47.578 --> 01:26:51.123
that meant the dictator had to go.

01:26:51.290 --> 01:26:55.002
We are gonna turn now to an almost
inconceivable act of protest.

01:26:55.169 --> 01:26:57.171
More than a dozen men
across the Middle East

01:26:57.338 --> 01:26:59.298
have now set themselves on fire

01:26:59.465 --> 01:27:02.134
to oppose corruption and repression
in their own countries.

01:27:02.301 --> 01:27:04.428
This massive uprising

01:27:04.595 --> 01:27:07.806
began with one man--
Mohamed Bouazizi.

01:27:07.973 --> 01:27:11.852
A 26-year-old college grad,
he was unable to find work

01:27:12.019 --> 01:27:14.480
and forced to sell fruit
in the street.

01:27:14.647 --> 01:27:18.275
Last month, harassed and insulted
by corrupt officials,

01:27:18.442 --> 01:27:21.820
he snapped
and set himself on fire.

01:27:21.987 --> 01:27:25.032
Mr. Bouazizi, he was a hero.

01:27:25.199 --> 01:27:28.452
Mr. Bouazizi was a martyr.
He was a hero.

01:27:28.619 --> 01:27:29.912
He's a symbol.

01:27:30.079 --> 01:27:33.749
He's a-- I thank him

01:27:33.916 --> 01:27:38.128
because he freed me
of my fear.

01:27:38.295 --> 01:27:39.546
Fear of what?

01:27:39.713 --> 01:27:43.425
Fear of oppression,
fear of the government.

01:27:43.592 --> 01:27:46.762
Armed only with the fruit
from Bouazizi's broken cart,

01:27:46.929 --> 01:27:50.641
the people of his town
stormed the governor's mansion

01:27:50.808 --> 01:27:53.185
and the revolution had begun.

01:27:56.355 --> 01:27:59.566
When the revolution happened,
I was pregnant,

01:27:59.733 --> 01:28:04.905
and I was so proud
that my babies are born free.

01:28:05.072 --> 01:28:07.574
They are born free citizens.

01:28:07.741 --> 01:28:10.119
They are born
proud to be Tunisian.

01:28:10.286 --> 01:28:12.288
I wasn't proud.
I was so ashamed.

01:28:12.454 --> 01:28:14.373
I studied in Paris
and I was like,

01:28:14.540 --> 01:28:18.043
"I'm here, I can talk to you
because it's in France. I'm safe."

01:28:18.210 --> 01:28:22.381
But I won't have the courage
to outspeak in my country

01:28:22.548 --> 01:28:24.466
because I choose life

01:28:24.633 --> 01:28:28.053
and I didn't have the courage
to be persecuted.

01:28:28.220 --> 01:28:30.222
And I'm quite ashamed
about that.

01:28:30.389 --> 01:28:32.269
So, what did you do
when the revolution started?

01:28:32.391 --> 01:28:35.561
The day of the revolution,
the 14 of January,

01:28:35.728 --> 01:28:39.481
as I told you, I wasn't in the street
because I was pregnant.

01:28:39.648 --> 01:28:42.359
And I was having journalists
all over Tunisia.

01:28:42.526 --> 01:28:48.073
I was trying, really,
to not censor

01:28:48.240 --> 01:28:49.742
as much as I could

01:28:49.908 --> 01:28:51.744
because censorship
was everywhere.

01:28:51.910 --> 01:28:55.456
And at some point,
one of my journalists called me crying

01:28:55.622 --> 01:28:56.749
and said to me,

01:28:56.915 --> 01:29:01.920
"My brother was shot
three minutes ago.

01:29:02.087 --> 01:29:04.506
So what are you
going to do now?"

01:29:04.673 --> 01:29:07.968
And it was like
a point of no return for me.

01:29:08.135 --> 01:29:12.431
I was ready to lose my job,
everything, but this guy--

01:29:12.598 --> 01:29:17.102
I still remember when
I put the phone down and I said,

01:29:17.269 --> 01:29:18.854
"Okay, stop.

01:29:19.021 --> 01:29:20.731
There's no turning back.

01:29:20.898 --> 01:29:22.941
His brother is dead
in front of him."

01:29:23.108 --> 01:29:28.655
So, I went into the studio and said,
"Guys are shot.

01:29:28.822 --> 01:29:31.325
We have to outspoke this."

01:29:33.869 --> 01:29:35.454
There were many women like Amel

01:29:35.621 --> 01:29:38.207
who played a key role
in the revolution.

01:29:39.666 --> 01:29:43.587
They toppled the dictator
and formed a democratic government.

01:29:46.048 --> 01:29:48.801
But when the newly formed
Islamist Party

01:29:48.967 --> 01:29:50.803
decided they
didn't want women's rights

01:29:50.969 --> 01:29:52.805
as part of the new constitution,

01:29:52.971 --> 01:29:55.140
the women of Tunisia
fought back.

01:30:01.605 --> 01:30:04.149
We have many new
political movements

01:30:04.316 --> 01:30:05.734
that weren't here before,

01:30:05.901 --> 01:30:09.738
and those movements
are threatening women's rights.

01:30:09.905 --> 01:30:11.740
And so now we're here
to defend them

01:30:11.907 --> 01:30:15.577
and to show that
we'll not lower our guards.

01:30:29.258 --> 01:30:31.385
E.R.A.! E.R.A.!

01:30:31.552 --> 01:30:33.637
Like with the women in Tunisia,

01:30:33.804 --> 01:30:37.391
women in America had tried to get
their Equal Rights Amendment

01:30:37.558 --> 01:30:41.145
to the Constitution passed
back in the 1970s,

01:30:41.311 --> 01:30:45.315
but it fell three states short
of ratification.

01:30:45.482 --> 01:30:47.443
The Tunisian women
were determined

01:30:47.609 --> 01:30:51.530
not to have the same fate
as those in America.

01:30:51.697 --> 01:30:54.741
They took to the streets
and rallied the people.

01:30:54.908 --> 01:30:59.455
And before long, the majority
of the country was behind them.

01:31:35.699 --> 01:31:38.076
The final vote
on the constitution was passed,

01:31:38.243 --> 01:31:42.873
with 200 voting yes,
four abstentions, and 12 no votes.

01:31:43.040 --> 01:31:45.459
Although
the Conservative Islamist Party

01:31:45.626 --> 01:31:47.461
controlled the most seats
in Parliament,

01:31:47.628 --> 01:31:50.047
they agreed to abide
by the will of the people,

01:31:50.214 --> 01:31:54.885
who wanted an equal rights provision
for women in the constitution.

01:31:55.052 --> 01:31:58.555
They also offered
to voluntarily step down,

01:31:58.722 --> 01:32:02.059
even though, legally,
they didn't have to.

01:32:02.226 --> 01:32:05.896
That's really amazing
that you decided to step down

01:32:06.063 --> 01:32:07.481
and follow the will of the people

01:32:07.648 --> 01:32:09.900
as opposed to following,
you know,

01:32:10.067 --> 01:32:13.070
maybe what some religious leader
might have told you to do.

01:32:30.587 --> 01:32:33.048
That's not
the impression that we're given

01:32:33.215 --> 01:32:37.052
in the United States
of anybody who's a Muslim.

01:32:37.219 --> 01:32:39.805
Do you require women
to cover their heads here?

01:33:02.786 --> 01:33:05.831
How do you feel about
discrimination against homosexuals?

01:33:25.809 --> 01:33:29.104
Is there something you think
America can learn from Tunisia?

01:33:31.273 --> 01:33:33.734
Americans are lucky.

01:33:33.900 --> 01:33:36.528
They are-- they belong

01:33:36.695 --> 01:33:39.865
to the most powerful country
in the world.

01:33:40.032 --> 01:33:43.827
But being the strongest one

01:33:43.994 --> 01:33:48.248
maybe stopped them
from being just curious.

01:33:49.833 --> 01:33:53.420
I know a lot about you guys.

01:33:53.587 --> 01:33:56.715
I know your music

01:33:56.882 --> 01:33:59.760
from the '70s until today.

01:33:59.926 --> 01:34:01.678
I dance on your music.

01:34:01.845 --> 01:34:04.598
I speak, as much as I can,
your language.

01:34:04.765 --> 01:34:09.519
I know Henry Miller, Kerouac,
Scott Fitzgerald.

01:34:09.686 --> 01:34:11.813
I wear your clothes.

01:34:11.980 --> 01:34:13.649
I eat your food.

01:34:13.815 --> 01:34:15.817
But I also have my culture.

01:34:15.984 --> 01:34:18.528
What do you know
about my culture?

01:34:18.695 --> 01:34:20.405
Or Estonian culture?

01:34:20.572 --> 01:34:23.367
Or Zimbabwean culture?

01:34:23.533 --> 01:34:26.828
I read an interesting article
about the average time

01:34:26.995 --> 01:34:30.874
an American spends
watching the Kardashian show.

01:34:32.918 --> 01:34:36.088
Why do you spend
your time for this?

01:34:36.254 --> 01:34:40.759
You invented the most powerful
weapon in the world--

01:34:40.926 --> 01:34:42.386
it's Internet, guys.

01:34:42.552 --> 01:34:45.222
Use it the right way.

01:34:45.389 --> 01:34:48.558
Check, read, watch,

01:34:48.725 --> 01:34:51.019
and then come to visit us.

01:34:51.186 --> 01:34:52.562
We're worth it.

01:34:52.729 --> 01:34:54.564
It's a little, small country.

01:34:54.731 --> 01:34:56.149
Its name is Tunisia.

01:34:56.316 --> 01:34:57.567
It's in North Africa.

01:34:57.734 --> 01:34:59.611
And I really think we deserve,

01:34:59.778 --> 01:35:03.073
as the other countries,
your attention,

01:35:03.240 --> 01:35:06.743
because if you keep
this way of thinking,

01:35:06.910 --> 01:35:11.540
that you are the best
and you know everything,

01:35:11.707 --> 01:35:13.250
it won't work.

01:35:32.394 --> 01:35:34.187
I was seven
when the women of Iceland

01:35:34.354 --> 01:35:38.066
went on strike
on October 24th, 1975.

01:35:41.445 --> 01:35:44.948
They marched into the center
of Reykjavik and filled the streets.

01:35:45.115 --> 01:35:48.201
90% of women
did no work that day.

01:35:48.368 --> 01:35:51.121
No schools opened.
No banks opened.

01:35:51.288 --> 01:35:54.416
No kids ate.
No busses rode into town.

01:35:54.583 --> 01:35:57.043
It was impossible
to get anything done on that day

01:35:57.210 --> 01:36:00.464
because when women don't work,
nothing works.

01:36:00.630 --> 01:36:04.593
They changed the impression
of the value of women

01:36:04.760 --> 01:36:07.095
for women and men
alike forever,

01:36:07.262 --> 01:36:09.723
because nothing worked
in Iceland that day.

01:36:09.890 --> 01:36:12.768
So they changed the very reality
that I grew up with,

01:36:12.934 --> 01:36:14.978
and they changed
my view on it forever.

01:36:15.145 --> 01:36:17.647
And five years after this day,
we were the first country

01:36:17.814 --> 01:36:20.442
to democratically elect
a female president.

01:36:20.609 --> 01:36:21.985
She was a single mom.

01:36:22.152 --> 01:36:23.987
She had
a seven-year-old daughter.

01:36:24.154 --> 01:36:28.450
You cannot help but to thank
those role models--

01:36:28.617 --> 01:36:30.160
and these women
who came before us--

01:36:30.327 --> 01:36:32.996
and think that we owe it
to the next generation

01:36:33.163 --> 01:36:37.709
to empower ourselves
and the generations that follow.

01:36:39.795 --> 01:36:41.505
I campaigned all over the country

01:36:41.671 --> 01:36:46.009
and it was absolutely
a unique experience.

01:36:46.176 --> 01:36:48.053
I never slept in a hotel.

01:36:48.220 --> 01:36:51.306
I slept in children's beds
around the country,

01:36:51.473 --> 01:36:52.557
and it was arranged.

01:36:52.724 --> 01:36:56.144
I knew who in the area
would vote for me

01:36:56.311 --> 01:36:58.814
and I campaigned,
and then--

01:36:58.980 --> 01:37:02.526
and finally I was elected.

01:37:06.530 --> 01:37:08.865
There were hundreds of people

01:37:09.032 --> 01:37:11.576
outside the house here.

01:37:11.743 --> 01:37:15.163
My daughter, seven years old,
was standing beside me.

01:37:19.334 --> 01:37:22.671
You know, if you take
the really long view of history,

01:37:22.838 --> 01:37:24.297
you have, essentially,

01:37:24.464 --> 01:37:27.551
a few thousand years
of it being just one way.

01:37:27.717 --> 01:37:29.886
Men in charge.

01:37:30.053 --> 01:37:31.429
Men in control.

01:37:31.596 --> 01:37:34.891
Men making the decisions,
calling the shots

01:37:35.058 --> 01:37:38.562
politically, economically,
socially, and personally.

01:37:40.188 --> 01:37:43.316
Look what's happened in this time
since that women's strike in '75,

01:37:43.483 --> 01:37:45.694
since your election in 1980.

01:37:45.861 --> 01:37:49.406
How many countries
have elected women?

01:37:49.573 --> 01:37:51.241
I mean, dozens.

01:37:51.408 --> 01:37:54.369
And that doesn't even count
the women elected by parliaments.

01:37:56.538 --> 01:38:00.625
All fathers know that their daughter
is as clever as the boy,

01:38:00.792 --> 01:38:02.085
has the same intelligence.

01:38:02.252 --> 01:38:05.088
All brothers know
that their sisters

01:38:05.255 --> 01:38:07.465
have the same intelligence
as they have.

01:38:07.632 --> 01:38:11.595
I'm very proud that Iceland
was the first and set an example.

01:38:11.761 --> 01:38:14.180
- Right.
- And, definitely, it had a very good--

01:38:14.347 --> 01:38:19.102
a very good effect
on our women and culture at home.

01:38:22.856 --> 01:38:23.940
Okay.

01:38:24.107 --> 01:38:25.587
That's exactly how I would've hit it.

01:38:26.610 --> 01:38:27.652
Dead center.

01:38:27.819 --> 01:38:29.946
I predict an eagle for this hole!

01:38:30.113 --> 01:38:33.658
Meet Hafdís,
Brynveig, and Margrét.

01:38:33.825 --> 01:38:36.244
Aside from beating me
in a game of golf

01:38:36.411 --> 01:38:41.625
on a balmy 29-degree day,
these women are all C.E.O.s,

01:38:41.791 --> 01:38:45.837
one of them the former head
of their Food and Drug Administration.

01:38:46.004 --> 01:38:48.673
They're part of a generation
of Icelandic women

01:38:48.840 --> 01:38:52.302
inspired by the election
of President Vigdís.

01:38:52.469 --> 01:38:56.514
I think Iceland is the best country
to be a female in

01:38:56.681 --> 01:38:57.807
in the world.

01:38:57.974 --> 01:39:01.478
There has been a lot of change
since the last, maybe, 20--

01:39:01.645 --> 01:39:04.189
- 15-- yeah, 15 to 20 years.
- To 20, yeah.

01:39:04.356 --> 01:39:05.556
- We've gone like that.
- Yeah.

01:39:05.649 --> 01:39:07.859
We have the same chance
as the men.

01:39:08.026 --> 01:39:09.426
- You do?
- Yeah, definitely.

01:39:09.486 --> 01:39:10.820
You do feel--
in your bones, you feel that?

01:39:10.987 --> 01:39:13.990
Yes, in your bones.
We grow up believing that.

01:39:14.157 --> 01:39:16.159
I mean, we don't even
think about it.

01:39:16.326 --> 01:39:18.828
We have a gender quota
for the biggest companies.

01:39:18.995 --> 01:39:20.288
You mean the company's
board of directors?

01:39:20.455 --> 01:39:23.166
- Yep.
- So, you have to be

01:39:23.333 --> 01:39:28.213
either at least 40% women
or 40% men.

01:39:28.380 --> 01:39:30.382
Because you also have to think
about the young men.

01:39:30.548 --> 01:39:32.175
They need to get
on the boards also,

01:39:32.342 --> 01:39:33.843
so it's a good law
for them also.

01:39:34.010 --> 01:39:35.428
Right, so-- so, yeah.

01:39:35.595 --> 01:39:37.555
So it can't be
more than 60% women.

01:39:37.722 --> 01:39:40.225
- Yeah.
- No, no.

01:39:40.392 --> 01:39:43.019
That's true, yeah.

01:39:43.186 --> 01:39:46.606
Research has shown us that--
and this is international research--

01:39:46.773 --> 01:39:48.817
that once you have three women
in the boardroom,

01:39:48.984 --> 01:39:50.860
that's when culture starts changing.

01:39:51.027 --> 01:39:52.821
Not when you have one or two.

01:39:52.988 --> 01:39:56.282
Because one is a token
and two is a minority.

01:39:56.449 --> 01:39:57.867
But once you have three,

01:39:58.034 --> 01:40:00.662
it all of a sudden changes
the group dynamics,

01:40:00.829 --> 01:40:04.207
it changes how the dialogue
is taken, what is discussed,

01:40:04.374 --> 01:40:08.670
and it's been well shown that
that goes beyond the balance sheet

01:40:08.837 --> 01:40:11.006
when you have more women
around the table.

01:40:11.172 --> 01:40:13.383
They start asking more
about all stakeholders,

01:40:13.550 --> 01:40:17.053
and this is what I call a different
moral and ethical compass.

01:40:17.220 --> 01:40:20.223
And I think this
is extremely valuable today.

01:40:20.390 --> 01:40:23.560
And I actually don't think you can
survive long-term in business

01:40:23.727 --> 01:40:25.603
without doing this today.

01:40:25.770 --> 01:40:27.689
Throughout my invasions,

01:40:27.856 --> 01:40:32.318
it was clear that where women
had power and were true equals,

01:40:32.485 --> 01:40:35.071
people were simply better off.

01:40:35.238 --> 01:40:38.116
Yet here in Iceland, I felt that
the women had taken this

01:40:38.283 --> 01:40:40.326
to an even higher level.

01:40:40.493 --> 01:40:43.913
And while they controlled nearly half
the seats on company boards

01:40:44.080 --> 01:40:46.207
and nearly half the seats
in Parliament,

01:40:46.374 --> 01:40:48.084
it did make me wonder--

01:40:48.251 --> 01:40:51.755
what was it that the men of Iceland
still controlled?

01:40:55.425 --> 01:40:57.802
When much of the world
went into recession last year,

01:40:57.969 --> 01:41:00.597
no country melted down
faster than Iceland,

01:41:00.764 --> 01:41:03.308
dragging down
three major banks with it.

01:41:03.475 --> 01:41:06.936
The only bank to operate in the black
is run by women.

01:41:07.103 --> 01:41:10.690
So, does gender make a difference
in the financial world?

01:41:10.857 --> 01:41:12.108
Here's Sheila MacVicar.

01:41:12.275 --> 01:41:14.903
Iceland's collapse
was the fastest in history,

01:41:15.070 --> 01:41:19.783
with 85% of the economy
wiped out in weeks.

01:41:19.949 --> 01:41:22.285
There was only one
financial institution,

01:41:22.452 --> 01:41:24.120
Audur Capital, in Iceland,

01:41:24.287 --> 01:41:27.123
that did not lose money
for its customers.

01:41:27.290 --> 01:41:29.959
Founded by two women
on the investment principle of

01:41:30.126 --> 01:41:32.253
"if we don't understand it,
we're not buying it,"

01:41:32.420 --> 01:41:35.298
there's a lot of talk here
about the difference it would've made

01:41:35.465 --> 01:41:38.093
if more women
were on the trading floors.

01:41:38.259 --> 01:41:40.970
It's been 99% men
that wanted to take risk,

01:41:41.137 --> 01:41:43.473
wanted speed,
wanted individual rewards

01:41:43.640 --> 01:41:45.016
and excessive rewards.

01:41:45.183 --> 01:41:46.743
There is new evidence emerging

01:41:46.851 --> 01:41:48.645
that some of what happens
on trading floors

01:41:48.812 --> 01:41:52.273
may be partly the result
of male hormones.

01:41:52.440 --> 01:41:54.317
When testosterone levels
get too high,

01:41:54.484 --> 01:41:56.027
traders become overconfident,

01:41:56.194 --> 01:41:58.863
take too much risk,
and the bubble bursts.

01:41:59.030 --> 01:42:01.366
Women, they think,
"What's good for the whole?"

01:42:01.533 --> 01:42:06.204
Where men, more,
they think, "What's in it for me?"

01:42:06.371 --> 01:42:09.207
It's a provocative question
being debated around the globe.

01:42:09.374 --> 01:42:13.294
Where would we be
if it had been Lehman Sisters?

01:42:13.461 --> 01:42:14.671
So, do you think
any of this would've happened

01:42:14.838 --> 01:42:16.673
if women had been
in charge in 2008?

01:42:16.840 --> 01:42:18.967
I thought we had created a world

01:42:19.134 --> 01:42:21.761
that was on
an empty pursuit for more,

01:42:21.928 --> 01:42:25.849
and I had a question about
if this growth journey we had been on

01:42:26.015 --> 01:42:29.686
was really a successful
business strategy

01:42:29.853 --> 01:42:33.189
that I had somehow missed
during my M.B.A. education.

01:42:33.356 --> 01:42:37.694
Is it a relentless pursuit
for getting big?

01:42:37.861 --> 01:42:40.572
Or is this the great big
penis competition?

01:42:40.738 --> 01:42:42.740
So, 20, 30 persons in Iceland

01:42:42.907 --> 01:42:45.326
has turned the whole economy
on this island on its head?

01:42:45.493 --> 01:42:46.870
Yes.

01:42:47.036 --> 01:42:48.121
20, 30 persons?

01:42:48.288 --> 01:42:49.706
Yes.

01:42:49.873 --> 01:42:51.040
That's insane.

01:42:51.207 --> 01:42:52.375
Yes, that is.

01:42:52.542 --> 01:42:56.421
Normally stoic and proper
Icelanders have started protesting.

01:43:06.890 --> 01:43:09.976
Yo.
Ahem.

01:43:40.256 --> 01:43:43.259
His name was Jón Gnarr

01:43:43.426 --> 01:43:45.470
and he's Iceland's top comedian.

01:43:49.766 --> 01:43:53.269
He decided to run for mayor
of its capital city, Reykjavik,

01:43:53.436 --> 01:43:55.230
as a joke.

01:43:55.396 --> 01:43:58.608
The people of Reykjavik
thought it was the best way

01:43:58.775 --> 01:44:00.735
to send a message to the bankers

01:44:00.902 --> 01:44:03.738
and the people who had
ruined their country.

01:44:03.905 --> 01:44:06.105
So, why did you decide
to call it the Best Party?

01:44:06.241 --> 01:44:10.745
Well, because there's
this idea of "best."

01:44:10.912 --> 01:44:14.374
Here, we're not allowed to say
that something is "best."

01:44:14.540 --> 01:44:15.959
You mean, here--

01:44:16.125 --> 01:44:17.210
it's not against the law.

01:44:17.377 --> 01:44:18.628
You mean Icelandic culture.

01:44:18.795 --> 01:44:20.797
- Yeah, I'm-- it's a law.
- Oh, it is a law.

01:44:20.964 --> 01:44:24.842
I cannot say that this brand of coffee
is the best brand of coffee.

01:44:25.009 --> 01:44:28.137
- Oh, really?
- No, you-- you cannot say it.

01:44:28.304 --> 01:44:30.682
- Have you tried it?
- Yeah, it's very good.

01:44:30.848 --> 01:44:33.142
But it's not the best.
It's the best, but I can't say it.

01:44:33.309 --> 01:44:35.478
It might be the-- okay.

01:44:35.645 --> 01:44:39.649
No, but they don't have
these rules in politics.

01:44:39.816 --> 01:44:42.110
He won in a landslide.

01:44:42.277 --> 01:44:46.281
His election was a total rebuke
of these guys.

01:44:48.533 --> 01:44:49.659
The bankers.

01:44:49.826 --> 01:44:51.995
Anybody who has kids
will know

01:44:52.161 --> 01:44:54.831
that if the kids get away
with their crime,

01:44:54.998 --> 01:44:57.375
chances are they will continue.

01:44:57.542 --> 01:44:59.502
When the bankers went to court,

01:44:59.669 --> 01:45:02.088
they went to a real criminal court.

01:45:02.255 --> 01:45:04.674
And when the judges
issued the sentence,

01:45:04.841 --> 01:45:07.010
they put the bankers away.

01:45:08.219 --> 01:45:10.388
Far away.

01:45:10.555 --> 01:45:12.557
Far...

01:45:12.724 --> 01:45:13.933
far...

01:45:14.976 --> 01:45:16.102
far...

01:45:16.269 --> 01:45:20.189
really far away.

01:45:20.356 --> 01:45:23.693
They were being kept as far away
from society as possible,

01:45:23.860 --> 01:45:27.363
where they could do no harm
to the people of Iceland.

01:45:27.530 --> 01:45:30.366
That's not exactly
how we did it.

01:45:30.533 --> 01:45:33.202
Well, there was that one guy
named Kareem.

01:45:33.369 --> 01:45:35.163
But since the crash of '08,

01:45:35.330 --> 01:45:37.749
not a single banker
without a Muslim name

01:45:37.915 --> 01:45:42.879
has been tried in a criminal court
in the United States of America.

01:45:43.046 --> 01:45:46.758
In Iceland, nearly 70 bankers

01:45:46.924 --> 01:45:49.677
and hedge fund managers
were prosecuted,

01:45:49.844 --> 01:45:52.472
with many of them sent to prison.

01:45:53.723 --> 01:45:55.767
I went to see the top cop,

01:45:55.933 --> 01:46:00.563
the special prosecutor appointed
to put the bankers in prison.

01:46:00.730 --> 01:46:04.484
His name was
Ólafur Thor Hauksson.

01:46:07.195 --> 01:46:11.199
The bankers
know him as Thor.

01:46:13.534 --> 01:46:16.621
So, Thor, I have
the files here, actually,

01:46:16.788 --> 01:46:19.540
of the people that I think
helped precipitate

01:46:19.707 --> 01:46:21.793
the banking collapse
in the United States.

01:46:21.959 --> 01:46:23.461
- Okay.
- Just take a look at that

01:46:23.628 --> 01:46:26.297
in your spare time here,
if you can.

01:46:26.464 --> 01:46:29.133
If you read through these,
these files...

01:46:30.760 --> 01:46:34.931
you'll see things that will make
even Icelandic hair stand up on end.

01:46:35.098 --> 01:46:36.224
- Okay.
- I mean, it's--

01:46:36.391 --> 01:46:37.809
- Can I keep these?
- You can, actually.

01:46:37.975 --> 01:46:40.478
Yep, I wish you would.
Yes.

01:46:40.645 --> 01:46:42.563
Actually,
you know, in the States,

01:46:42.730 --> 01:46:46.150
you have the ability
and the knowledge

01:46:46.317 --> 01:46:47.797
- to do the right thing.
- Yes.

01:46:47.860 --> 01:46:50.530
In America,
you had a prior incident.

01:46:50.696 --> 01:46:53.449
You had the savings
and loan scandal.

01:46:53.616 --> 01:46:55.660
You had some prosecutions
at that time.

01:46:55.827 --> 01:46:57.036
- We did.
- Yeah.

01:46:57.203 --> 01:46:58.287
That's right,
and people went to jail.

01:46:58.454 --> 01:47:01.457
So, you have-- one of the prosecutors
that actually worked on that,

01:47:01.624 --> 01:47:03.418
he gave us an advice.

01:47:03.584 --> 01:47:06.087
So, our prosecutor,
one of them,

01:47:06.254 --> 01:47:08.381
gave advice to your office
to help you...

01:47:08.548 --> 01:47:09.882
- Yeah. Yeah.
- ...do this?

01:47:12.927 --> 01:47:13.970
Jack Black?

01:47:14.137 --> 01:47:15.388
No, no, no.
Not Jack Black.

01:47:15.555 --> 01:47:17.140
It was Bill Black, I think.

01:47:17.306 --> 01:47:19.100
The former prosecutor
in the U.S.

01:47:19.267 --> 01:47:21.060
He was quite blunt with us.

01:47:21.227 --> 01:47:23.688
We learned a lot from him.

01:47:24.814 --> 01:47:27.191
Well, Thor,
I've invaded Iceland

01:47:27.358 --> 01:47:30.862
because you've decided
to investigate and prosecute

01:47:31.028 --> 01:47:32.905
your bankers
after your banking collapse

01:47:33.072 --> 01:47:35.241
and put a number of them
in prison.

01:47:35.408 --> 01:47:38.494
And that's just a genius idea

01:47:38.661 --> 01:47:40.261
I want to take back
to the United States.

01:47:40.413 --> 01:47:41.497
Okay.

01:47:41.664 --> 01:47:42.999
You're the man.

01:47:43.166 --> 01:47:45.877
Thank you for this great idea.

01:47:46.043 --> 01:47:48.045
- Thank you.
- God bless you.

01:47:52.884 --> 01:47:55.344
Because Iceland
didn't bail out their banks

01:47:55.511 --> 01:47:57.847
and instead prosecuted
the bankers

01:47:58.014 --> 01:48:02.018
and turned much of the financial
decision-making over to the women,

01:48:02.185 --> 01:48:04.770
their economy
has completely recovered.

01:48:04.937 --> 01:48:07.356
In fact,
it's doing better than ever.

01:48:08.357 --> 01:48:10.693
Why do you think
the United States is like this?

01:48:12.987 --> 01:48:14.739
Why don't we have
what you have?

01:48:14.906 --> 01:48:17.575
In America, you have
the American dream.

01:48:17.742 --> 01:48:21.204
That you have--
it's a land of opportunities.

01:48:21.370 --> 01:48:26.042
That everybody will be able
to do whatever.

01:48:26.209 --> 01:48:31.380
But in reality it isn't like that.

01:48:31.547 --> 01:48:33.508
Every kid should have
the same opportunity--

01:48:33.674 --> 01:48:37.470
the basic opportunity
to get education and health care.

01:48:38.554 --> 01:48:42.767
It's not Communism,
it's just a good society.

01:48:42.934 --> 01:48:45.937
Mm-hmm.
- You play more solo.

01:48:46.103 --> 01:48:48.397
I'm taking care of myself
and my family

01:48:48.564 --> 01:48:50.650
and the rest,
I don't care about.

01:48:50.816 --> 01:48:53.611
But we are more
like a big group

01:48:53.778 --> 01:48:56.864
and we try to take care of each other
within that group.

01:48:57.031 --> 01:49:01.285
Right. You structure yourself
with "we" in mind

01:49:01.452 --> 01:49:04.205
and we structure ourselves
with "me" in mind.

01:49:04.372 --> 01:49:06.499
- It's the women.
- More women.

01:49:06.666 --> 01:49:08.960
- It's women, right?
- It's our DNA.

01:49:09.126 --> 01:49:10.920
Yeah.

01:49:12.547 --> 01:49:15.258
I'm convinced.

01:49:15.424 --> 01:49:16.676
It's my conviction.

01:49:16.842 --> 01:49:19.512
That's my belief in women,

01:49:19.679 --> 01:49:23.099
the capacity
and the intelligence of women.

01:49:23.266 --> 01:49:28.062
If the world can be saved,
it will be women that do that.

01:49:28.229 --> 01:49:31.899
And they do not do it with war;
they do it with words.

01:49:37.738 --> 01:49:39.490
Women, if they are running society,

01:49:39.657 --> 01:49:41.409
they are looking for peace.

01:49:43.327 --> 01:49:46.038
They want to save humanity.

01:49:46.205 --> 01:49:48.082
They want to save their children.

01:49:51.794 --> 01:49:54.964
When the men on Earth open up

01:49:55.131 --> 01:49:57.133
to how women see things

01:49:57.300 --> 01:50:00.469
and add it to their way
of seeing things,

01:50:00.636 --> 01:50:02.597
then we get a better world.

01:51:07.578 --> 01:51:09.497
If you were to talk to Americans,

01:51:09.664 --> 01:51:11.207
if you had two minutes
to say anything you wanted

01:51:11.374 --> 01:51:14.043
to the American people,

01:51:14.210 --> 01:51:15.920
what would you say?

01:51:22.718 --> 01:51:24.720
And don't be afraid
of hurting our feelings.

01:51:24.887 --> 01:51:26.263
- No.
- We need some truth here.

01:51:26.430 --> 01:51:27.932
No.

01:51:28.099 --> 01:51:33.437
I wouldn't want to live in the States,
even though you paid me.

01:51:33.604 --> 01:51:38.067
Because there's-- the society
and the way that you treat people,

01:51:38.234 --> 01:51:40.986
the way that you treat
your neighbors.

01:51:41.153 --> 01:51:44.657
I would never want
to be your neighbor.

01:51:44.824 --> 01:51:47.201
Never, ever.

01:51:47.368 --> 01:51:52.081
Because you don't treat
your fellow Americans

01:51:52.248 --> 01:51:54.125
the way you should.

01:51:54.291 --> 01:51:59.046
How can you, in a way,
come home and feel well

01:51:59.213 --> 01:52:03.426
if you know there are
so many people that can't eat,

01:52:03.592 --> 01:52:05.970
they're sick, they can't
go to the doctor's,

01:52:06.137 --> 01:52:09.098
they can't get any education?

01:52:09.265 --> 01:52:12.435
How can you come home
and feel okay with that?

01:52:12.601 --> 01:52:14.353
I couldn't.

01:52:22.236 --> 01:52:23.863
I don't feel okay about it.

01:52:24.029 --> 01:52:25.906
No, that's good.

01:52:29.452 --> 01:52:32.538
You shouldn't feel okay with it.

01:52:55.019 --> 01:52:56.312
We just had, like,
a hammer and chisel

01:52:56.479 --> 01:52:59.607
and we were just-- I don't know,
there were a couple dozen people here,

01:52:59.774 --> 01:53:01.317
and we were just like--
the chisel

01:53:01.484 --> 01:53:04.779
and then banging away
on this thing, you know?

01:53:07.656 --> 01:53:09.366
Did this for two or three nights,

01:53:09.533 --> 01:53:11.869
and the crowd kept getting
larger and larger.

01:53:12.036 --> 01:53:14.705
And there was no hole yet
in the wall,

01:53:14.872 --> 01:53:18.417
but you'd hit this steel stuff
and then sooner or later,

01:53:18.584 --> 01:53:21.837
you know, a little crack
would appear in the wall

01:53:22.004 --> 01:53:25.257
and the East Germans
on the other side,

01:53:25.424 --> 01:53:26.864
they were just, like,
having a smoke.

01:53:27.009 --> 01:53:30.429
They didn't-- I think
they knew it was over.

01:53:31.680 --> 01:53:33.766
This is my buddy Rod
from Michigan,

01:53:33.933 --> 01:53:37.812
and we've met up in Berlin now
at the end of my invasions.

01:53:37.978 --> 01:53:41.106
In November of 1989, we happened
to be traveling through Berlin

01:53:41.273 --> 01:53:44.109
when we heard that a few people
were down at the Berlin Wall

01:53:44.276 --> 01:53:47.112
and were chiseling on it
for some reason.

01:53:47.279 --> 01:53:50.366
We thought, "Hey, we got
a couple hours to kill.

01:53:50.533 --> 01:53:53.202
Let's check this out."

01:53:53.369 --> 01:53:54.870
You know, there weren't
that many doing it then.

01:53:55.037 --> 01:53:56.580
It was just those first few nights.

01:53:56.747 --> 01:53:59.083
And I don't know,
I was just chiseling away on this thing

01:53:59.250 --> 01:54:01.836
and all of a sudden I looked up
and you were on top of that,

01:54:02.002 --> 01:54:04.713
you know, like, dancing around
on the top of the wall.

01:54:04.880 --> 01:54:07.258
I'm trying to remember,
how many Germans did it take

01:54:07.424 --> 01:54:09.885
to hoist you
up to the top of that wall?

01:54:10.052 --> 01:54:13.889
Well, there was one that got me--
you know, he sort of grabbed my foot.

01:54:14.056 --> 01:54:18.102
And then another one grabbed my belt
and kind of shoved me up,

01:54:18.269 --> 01:54:20.813
and then I was able
to grab hold of the top of it.

01:54:20.980 --> 01:54:22.356
We stayed at the wall,

01:54:22.523 --> 01:54:25.317
chiseling away
for the next three days.

01:54:25.484 --> 01:54:27.778
The thing about this
is that you and I grew up

01:54:27.945 --> 01:54:29.238
- in the Cold War...
- Yeah.

01:54:29.405 --> 01:54:31.699
...and if there was one thing
that was certain, it was that this wall

01:54:31.866 --> 01:54:33.576
- would never come down.
- Yes.

01:54:33.742 --> 01:54:36.078
Built to stand forever.

01:54:36.245 --> 01:54:38.247
Impenetrable.

01:54:38.414 --> 01:54:40.708
It lasted less than 30 years.

01:54:40.875 --> 01:54:41.959
Yeah.

01:54:42.126 --> 01:54:44.587
And, in a night,
it was over.

01:54:44.753 --> 01:54:47.423
I remember that,
and around the same time,

01:54:47.590 --> 01:54:48.924
Mandela got out of prison

01:54:49.091 --> 01:54:50.891
and then became
the president of South Africa.

01:54:50.926 --> 01:54:53.387
And those two events--
like, from that moment on in my life,

01:54:53.554 --> 01:54:55.598
I was like, "Oh, I get it.

01:54:55.764 --> 01:54:57.433
Anything can happen."

01:54:59.101 --> 01:55:01.729
They always say
the solution is too complicated,

01:55:01.896 --> 01:55:04.106
but there's always
simple answers to these things.

01:55:04.273 --> 01:55:07.234
You just take the hammer
and you knock it down.

01:55:07.401 --> 01:55:10.529
- You know?
- It really was as simple as that.

01:55:10.696 --> 01:55:14.158
Hammer, right?
Chisel, down.

01:55:14.325 --> 01:55:16.368
- Down.
- Hammer, chisel, down.

01:55:16.535 --> 01:55:19.121
- Rinse, repeat.
- Hammer, chisel, down.

01:55:19.288 --> 01:55:20.768
You know?
And then three months later,

01:55:20.915 --> 01:55:22.583
- it's official.
- Yeah.

01:55:22.750 --> 01:55:26.462
This Cold War, this wall that was
supposed to go on forever

01:55:26.629 --> 01:55:31.133
was-- boop-- gone,
just like that, you know?

01:55:31.300 --> 01:55:33.510
It's like, three years ago,
gay marriage in the United States

01:55:33.677 --> 01:55:35.763
was outlawed in every state.

01:55:35.930 --> 01:55:38.641
- Yeah.
- Now law of the land.

01:55:39.808 --> 01:55:42.853
It was like, wow, that was quick.

01:55:43.020 --> 01:55:44.355
You know?

01:55:44.521 --> 01:55:49.068
So, I'm just-- I've turned
into this kind of crazy optimist

01:55:49.234 --> 01:55:52.446
that-- just name something
that seems impossible,

01:55:52.613 --> 01:55:56.784
and this wall proves
that that could happen.

01:55:56.951 --> 01:55:58.869
- Yeah.
- That, you know, suddenly--

01:55:59.036 --> 01:56:02.665
first it's a wall,
now there's a hole in the wall,

01:56:02.831 --> 01:56:05.376
and then soon
the wall comes down.

01:56:16.011 --> 01:56:18.764
- Pretty cool.
- Yeah.

01:56:20.015 --> 01:56:23.686
We discussed all the great things
I had taken from my invasions,

01:56:23.852 --> 01:56:26.480
but I began to lament
that the American dream

01:56:26.647 --> 01:56:31.235
seemed to be alive and well
everywhere but America.

01:56:33.654 --> 01:56:38.033
It was then that Rod reminded me
that he and I and most of our generation

01:56:38.200 --> 01:56:40.786
went to college
for practically free.

01:56:42.371 --> 01:56:44.540
He reminded me
that the Finnish education chief

01:56:44.707 --> 01:56:49.378
had said that their education ideas
were American ideas,

01:56:49.545 --> 01:56:53.716
and that May Day didn't begin
in Moscow or Lisbon,

01:56:53.882 --> 01:56:56.885
it began in Chicago in 1886.

01:56:57.052 --> 01:56:59.054
That's where the fight
for the eight-hour day

01:56:59.221 --> 01:57:01.390
and a vacation came from--

01:57:01.557 --> 01:57:03.726
American unions.

01:57:04.893 --> 01:57:07.521
The fight for the E.R.A.
began eight years

01:57:07.688 --> 01:57:10.649
before Iceland elected
the first female president.

01:57:12.276 --> 01:57:14.820
The same thing
with the Norwegian prison warden,

01:57:14.987 --> 01:57:19.491
that the idea of no cruel or unusual
punishment was ours.

01:57:19.658 --> 01:57:21.994
And it was our state,
Michigan,

01:57:22.161 --> 01:57:25.414
that became the first English-speaking
government in the world

01:57:25.581 --> 01:57:28.250
to eliminate the death penalty.

01:57:28.417 --> 01:57:30.753
And the special prosecutor
in Iceland,

01:57:30.919 --> 01:57:34.631
he based his whole investigation
and prosecution of the bankers

01:57:34.798 --> 01:57:38.177
on our savings and loan scandal
back in the '80s.

01:57:38.343 --> 01:57:41.013
Even hired an American
to help him with it.

01:57:41.180 --> 01:57:44.224
These weren't European ideas.

01:57:44.391 --> 01:57:46.602
These weren't new ideas.

01:57:48.103 --> 01:57:50.522
These were our ideas.

01:57:50.689 --> 01:57:52.858
We didn't need to invade
all these countries

01:57:53.025 --> 01:57:55.611
to steal their ideas.

01:57:55.778 --> 01:57:57.946
They were already ours.

01:57:58.113 --> 01:58:00.324
We didn't need to invade.

01:58:00.491 --> 01:58:04.119
We just needed to go
to the American lost and found.

01:58:04.286 --> 01:58:07.122
Maybe that was the answer.

01:58:07.289 --> 01:58:09.583
Oh, will you help me?
Can you help me?

01:58:09.750 --> 01:58:11.752
You don't need to be helped
any longer.

01:58:11.919 --> 01:58:14.463
You've always had the power
to go back to Kansas.

01:58:14.630 --> 01:58:16.298
I have?

01:58:16.465 --> 01:58:18.926
Yes, you have.

01:58:19.093 --> 01:58:21.136
And so have we.

01:58:21.303 --> 01:58:22.971
We've always had it.

01:58:23.138 --> 01:58:24.973
Kansas, anyone?

01:58:25.140 --> 01:58:27.434
 What's your plan
for tomorrow? 

01:58:27.601 --> 01:58:30.145
 Are you a leader
or will you follow? 

01:58:30.312 --> 01:58:32.648
 Are you a fighter
or will you cower? 

01:58:32.815 --> 01:58:35.609
 It's our time
to take back the power 

01:58:36.777 --> 01:58:39.947
 We don't need
to run and hide 

01:58:41.490 --> 01:58:45.494
 We won't be pushed
off to the side 

01:58:45.661 --> 01:58:48.330
 What's your plan
for tomorrow? 

01:58:48.497 --> 01:58:50.874
 Are you a leader
or will you follow? 

01:58:51.041 --> 01:58:53.418
 Are you a fighter
or will you cower? 

01:58:53.585 --> 01:58:55.921
 It's our time
to take back the power 

01:58:56.088 --> 01:58:58.757
 What's your plan
for tomorrow? 

01:58:58.924 --> 01:59:01.176
 Are you a leader
or will you follow? 

01:59:01.343 --> 01:59:03.762
 Are you a fighter
or will you cower? 

01:59:03.929 --> 01:59:06.390
 It's our time
to take back the power 

01:59:06.557 --> 01:59:09.101
 What's your plan
for tomorrow? 

01:59:09.268 --> 01:59:11.603
 Are you a leader
or will you follow? 

01:59:11.770 --> 01:59:14.022
 Are you a fighter
or will you cower? 

01:59:14.189 --> 01:59:18.360
 It's our time
to take back the power. 

01:59:21.280 --> 01:59:23.532
 Anything you can do,
I can do better 

01:59:23.699 --> 01:59:25.784
 I can do anything
better than you 

01:59:25.951 --> 01:59:27.351
-  No, you can't 
-  Yes, I can 

01:59:27.494 --> 01:59:28.579
-  No, you can't 
-  Yes, I can 

01:59:28.745 --> 01:59:31.874
-  No, you can't 
-  Yes, I can, yes, I can 

01:59:32.040 --> 01:59:34.376
 Anything you can be,
I can be greater 

01:59:34.543 --> 01:59:36.795
 Sooner or later,
I'm greater than you 

01:59:36.962 --> 01:59:38.005
-  No, you're not 
-  Yes, I am 

01:59:38.172 --> 01:59:39.572
-  No, you're not 
-  Yes, I am 

01:59:39.715 --> 01:59:42.593
-  No, you're not 
-  Yes, I am, yes, I am 

01:59:42.759 --> 01:59:45.387
 Anything you can sing,
I can sing higher 

01:59:45.554 --> 01:59:47.723
 I can sing anything
higher than you 

01:59:47.890 --> 01:59:48.932
-  No, you can't 
-  Yes, I can 

01:59:49.099 --> 01:59:50.225
-  No, you can't 
-  Yes, I can 

01:59:50.392 --> 01:59:51.810
-  No, you can't 
-  Yes, I can 

01:59:51.977 --> 01:59:54.229
 No, you can't 

01:59:54.396 --> 02:00:02.396
-  Yes, I can. 
-  No, you can't. 

02:00:03.572 --> 02:00:05.908
- Ma'am. Ma'am.
- Ma'am, get off the pole.

02:00:06.074 --> 02:00:07.492
- Ma'am.
- Ma'am!
