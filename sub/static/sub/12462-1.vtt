00:43.650 --> 00:45.641
Mr. Kuklinski.

00:47.810 --> 00:51.006
Do you have any regrets
for the things you've done?

01:54.925 --> 01:57.677
You know,
it's not very polite.

01:57.764 --> 01:59.322
Ask a girl out for coffee,

01:59.404 --> 02:01.838
you should have
something to say.

02:01.924 --> 02:04.996
Like what?
I don't know.

02:05.084 --> 02:06.756
You're the one that
asked me here.

02:12.923 --> 02:15.756
So, what do you do for a living?

02:15.843 --> 02:18.437
I dub cartoons for Disney.

02:18.523 --> 02:21.799
No way!
What's your favorite?

02:21.882 --> 02:23.395
Cinderella.

02:27.322 --> 02:28.641
Really?

02:28.722 --> 02:29.996
Yeah.

02:31.162 --> 02:33.118
What is that?

02:33.202 --> 02:35.271
He, he used to be some sort
of devil, I think.

02:35.361 --> 02:36.953
I don't know.

02:37.041 --> 02:38.679
I was trying to look tough,
I guess.

02:38.761 --> 02:40.558
How come?

02:40.681 --> 02:42.433
Does it bother you?

02:42.521 --> 02:45.957
Not at all.

02:46.041 --> 02:51.034
You're, uh, you're a, you're
a prettier version of...

02:51.120 --> 02:53.588
What?

02:53.720 --> 02:55.676
Nah. No, what were
you going to say?

02:55.760 --> 02:57.318
Um, uh...

02:57.400 --> 02:58.799
You were going to say something.
What?

02:58.880 --> 03:00.199
No. Nothing.

03:02.359 --> 03:04.793
So, you got any family, or...?

03:04.879 --> 03:09.350
Yeah, my sister and brother are
around somewhere, I guess.

03:09.439 --> 03:11.430
What, you don't talk to them?

03:11.519 --> 03:15.830
Not really. They're lousy
conversationalists.

03:15.918 --> 03:19.672
Well, I guess it runs
in the family.

03:19.758 --> 03:22.397
Most people I talk to don't
have nothing to say.

03:22.478 --> 03:26.153
No, I... I didn't mean
anything. I just...

03:26.238 --> 03:28.307
I get nervous
around new people.

03:28.397 --> 03:30.433
I didn't mean you.

03:30.517 --> 03:32.394
No? Okay.

03:36.597 --> 03:39.907
You're a prettier version
of Natalie Wood.

03:39.997 --> 03:42.669
I don't look anything like her.

03:42.756 --> 03:44.553
To me, you do.

03:48.796 --> 03:50.593
Cheers.

03:50.676 --> 03:52.394
I thought it was bad luck
to cheer with water.

03:52.476 --> 03:55.148
I don't believe in bad luck.

04:10.634 --> 04:12.545
Oh, you're funny.

04:12.634 --> 04:14.033
I hope so.

04:17.474 --> 04:20.909
I'm sorry.
My aunt is always late.

04:20.993 --> 04:22.790
You don't have
to wait.

04:22.873 --> 04:23.908
I don't mind.

04:25.313 --> 04:27.429
I had a really good time.

04:27.513 --> 04:29.310
I'm glad
you insisted.

04:32.073 --> 04:33.585
You mind if I call you again?

04:33.672 --> 04:35.390
Please do.
That would be great.

04:35.472 --> 04:37.463
Um, here she is.

04:46.111 --> 04:47.464
Goodnight.

05:15.749 --> 05:17.705
It's Earl, right?

05:17.789 --> 05:19.268
What do you do?

05:19.349 --> 05:21.738
I do business.
I'm a businessman.

05:21.829 --> 05:23.342
Ask Terry.
He knows.

05:23.429 --> 05:25.180
Yeah. He delivers,
uh, fucking diapers.

05:26.348 --> 05:27.861
What do you do?

05:27.948 --> 05:29.700
Me and Ritchie,
we make porno movies.

05:29.788 --> 05:31.779
Yeah, we dub 'em.

05:31.868 --> 05:35.099
So, Terry, which one of these guys
dates that girl Deborah?

05:35.188 --> 05:36.940
That'll be Ritchie.

05:37.068 --> 05:38.864
Yeah?
Yeah, how do you know Deborah?

05:38.947 --> 05:40.858
My friend Danny
went out with her.

05:40.947 --> 05:42.778
Girl waited three weeks

05:42.867 --> 05:44.778
to tell him she doesn't have sex
'til she's married.

05:44.867 --> 05:47.939
Hey, Earl, have some fucking
respect, okay?

05:48.027 --> 05:49.779
It's his future wife
you're talking about.

05:49.867 --> 05:51.458
I guess, if he's
desperate enough.

05:51.546 --> 05:52.979
Ooh.

05:55.546 --> 05:58.618
Yeah, I'm
pretty desperate.

05:58.706 --> 06:01.857
But, where there's a will...

06:04.346 --> 06:06.301
Oh! Nice
shot, Ritchie.

06:06.385 --> 06:09.377
There's a way,
my friend.

06:09.465 --> 06:13.378
Good shot,
Ritchie. Jesus.

06:13.505 --> 06:14.984
Nice.
Whoa.

06:15.065 --> 06:17.658
Where there's a will,
there's a way.

06:17.744 --> 06:22.340
Unbelievable, man.
Good job.

06:22.424 --> 06:23.982
Hey, what the fuck
you think you're doing?

06:24.064 --> 06:25.895
No, what is this, man?
Come on. What?

06:25.984 --> 06:27.975
This asshole turns you down,
so I take the bait?

06:28.064 --> 06:30.180
Easy, Earl, you just
pay what you owe.

06:33.823 --> 06:35.654
No, I'm not paying
you anything.

06:35.743 --> 06:39.258
Put the money
on the table.

06:39.343 --> 06:42.096
Put that money
on the table.

06:44.662 --> 06:46.175
Trust me.

06:46.262 --> 06:48.093
Take your money.
All right, go.

06:48.182 --> 06:50.935
Go to your porn lab,
jerk off with your friends.

06:51.022 --> 06:52.740
I'm going to fuck
a real woman tonight.

06:52.822 --> 06:54.619
Wow.

06:54.702 --> 06:58.330
And good luck getting
your dick in her.

06:58.461 --> 07:01.021
Take a walk.
It's not worth it, Rich.

07:01.101 --> 07:02.819
Yeah, Ritchie,
don't sweat that.

07:16.500 --> 07:17.728
Not worth it.

07:20.700 --> 07:22.497
come on,
stack 'em up.

07:44.898 --> 07:46.456
Ah!

08:16.295 --> 08:19.492
Dr. Hunter,
to Delivery, please.

08:19.575 --> 08:22.248
Dr. Hunter, to Delivery, please.

08:22.335 --> 08:24.405
Mr. Kuklinski?
Yeah.

08:24.495 --> 08:27.089
Your wife and daughter are in recovery.
They're doing fine.

08:27.175 --> 08:31.008
Oh, thanks. Thanks.
Uh, can I see them?

08:31.094 --> 08:32.652
Come with me.
All right.

08:36.134 --> 08:37.328
They're in here.

08:41.414 --> 08:43.085
Oh, wow.
They're asleep now.

08:53.813 --> 08:56.280
Congratulations,
you're a father.

09:23.610 --> 09:25.760
Yeah.
Ritchie.

09:25.890 --> 09:28.040
What the fuck's the matter
with you? You still there?

09:28.130 --> 09:29.802
We're still
seven boxes short.

09:29.890 --> 09:31.721
They called me
twice already.

09:31.810 --> 09:33.926
They're probably on the way
over there as we speak.

09:34.009 --> 09:36.045
Don't we got any shoes to give,
it's the wrong date?

09:36.129 --> 09:37.960
Roy Demeo is with them.
This fucking guy is crazy.

09:38.089 --> 09:39.920
Go home to your family.
Trust me on this. Okay.

09:40.009 --> 09:42.159
Hang up the phone and walk out.
You hear me, Ritchie?

09:42.249 --> 09:44.444
All right.

09:53.408 --> 09:55.000
What's this guy's name?

09:55.088 --> 09:57.204
Dino Lapron.

09:57.288 --> 09:59.279
Lapron?

09:59.368 --> 10:01.756
He's probably going to accuse me
of fucking up the dates.

10:01.847 --> 10:03.246
Did you?

10:03.327 --> 10:04.442
What kind of question is that?

10:04.527 --> 10:05.516
Yes or no?
Did you?

10:05.607 --> 10:07.438
No.

10:07.527 --> 10:09.119
Are you Lapron?

10:09.207 --> 10:10.799
Excuse me?
You Dino Lapron?

10:10.887 --> 10:12.400
That's not him, Roy.

10:12.487 --> 10:14.124
Where's Dino Lapron?
He's not here.

10:14.206 --> 10:16.879
Open the door.
There's nobody in here.

10:16.966 --> 10:18.524
Just open the door.

10:18.646 --> 10:21.319
Let's go.
You're coming.

10:35.685 --> 10:39.996
Seen any good movies lately?
I don't really watch them.

10:40.124 --> 10:41.637
I'm not
into porn myself,

10:41.724 --> 10:44.716
but I got to look out
for my customers.

10:44.804 --> 10:46.635
What do you got
for us?

10:46.724 --> 10:48.635
Well, Dino had the date
for the 28th, you know?

10:48.724 --> 10:51.318
We can't take the blame if you
change it last minute.

10:51.404 --> 10:53.234
Hey. That's
fucking bullshit.

10:53.323 --> 10:55.632
That's not what
I asked you.

10:55.763 --> 10:58.038
We're seven boxes short.

10:58.163 --> 11:00.757
Seven. We gotta adjust the machines
when they run all week.

11:00.843 --> 11:02.720
If somebody
would of told us

11:02.803 --> 11:04.555
they needed the order
earlier we could have...

11:08.242 --> 11:10.358
You like that? Huh?

11:10.442 --> 11:11.875
You got something
to say to me,

11:11.962 --> 11:13.634
you say it
to my fucking face.

11:13.722 --> 11:15.474
You fuck us and try
to act like a tough guy?

11:15.562 --> 11:17.041
If I work all night they'll
be finished tomorrow.

11:17.122 --> 11:19.271
Hey, look at me.
Stupid fuck.

11:19.361 --> 11:21.636
Tell me the truth.

11:21.721 --> 11:23.359
Let's kill the fucking guy.
Fuck Lapron.

11:23.441 --> 11:27.070
Put the gun down.

11:27.161 --> 11:29.197
I didn't fuck nothing up.
I'll fuck you up. Come on.

11:29.281 --> 11:31.556
I'll smack you
in the fucking mouth.

11:31.641 --> 11:33.437
What's your name?

11:33.520 --> 11:35.397
Ritchie Kuklinski.

11:35.520 --> 11:37.511
You know who I am?
Mm-hm.

11:39.680 --> 11:42.797
So if I came down here,
I must have had a good reason.

11:42.880 --> 11:44.791
I didn't say you didn't have
a good reason,

11:44.880 --> 11:46.028
I said the date was...

11:52.719 --> 11:54.391
If you want to complain
about life,

11:54.479 --> 11:57.437
you're talking to the wrong
fucking guy.

11:57.519 --> 12:03.388
You'll have this done
by tomorrow? Yes?

12:03.478 --> 12:05.434
All right, good.

12:05.518 --> 12:08.476
Let's get the fuck
out of here.

12:45.355 --> 12:46.674
Hey.

12:49.835 --> 12:51.313
We're at
the Gemini Lounge.

12:51.394 --> 12:53.624
It's on Flatlands
near the parkway.

12:53.714 --> 12:56.182
I'll drop the prints
off tomorrow.

12:56.274 --> 13:02.190
It's got nothing to do with that.
Roy wants to see you.

13:02.274 --> 13:03.547
Just be there.

13:53.150 --> 13:55.823
There.
It's okay.

14:00.269 --> 14:02.066
Well, what's Mommy
been looking at?

14:03.829 --> 14:05.660
Four bedrooms.

14:05.749 --> 14:08.104
Is this a private
conversation?

14:08.189 --> 14:09.826
Yeah, she's doing
all the talking.

14:09.948 --> 14:11.859
Well, so don't mind me.
Did I wake you up?

14:11.988 --> 14:13.944
No, I have
to feed her.

14:14.028 --> 14:15.507
Huh?

14:15.588 --> 14:17.340
Oh.

14:17.428 --> 14:21.387
So, what were you
two talking about?

14:21.468 --> 14:24.345
She says she don't
like living here.

14:24.427 --> 14:26.418
She wants a four-bedroom
in Dumars.

14:26.507 --> 14:30.944
Well, she's got good taste,
our daughter.

14:31.027 --> 14:35.577
Did you just get home?
Yeah, not long ago.

14:35.666 --> 14:39.784
Hm. It's so late.

14:39.866 --> 14:41.697
How was your day?

14:41.786 --> 14:43.378
It was good.
What happened to your hand?

14:43.466 --> 14:46.060
Eh, some jerk left
some film cans out,

14:46.186 --> 14:47.460
I almost fell
on my face.

14:49.425 --> 14:54.977
So, what do
we got here?

14:55.065 --> 14:58.740
Oh, it's just Vice President
Nixon's house.

14:58.865 --> 15:00.264
He just put it
on the market.

15:00.345 --> 15:01.663
You want
to look at it?

15:01.744 --> 15:03.860
Sure.

15:03.944 --> 15:06.094
Why are
you laughing?

15:06.184 --> 15:10.621
If we could afford an apartment
in Hoboken I'd be happy, Ritchie.

15:10.704 --> 15:12.137
No, you wouldn't.

15:12.224 --> 15:14.498
You think
I'm a spoiled brat.

15:14.583 --> 15:16.653
No. You like to be
taken care of.

15:16.743 --> 15:19.177
There's nothing
wrong with that.

15:19.263 --> 15:22.061
I like the way
you take care of me.

15:43.901 --> 15:45.129
Thank you.

16:03.500 --> 16:05.491
Hey, the guy from the porn
lab's here.

16:05.580 --> 16:08.252
You want me
to bring him up?

16:08.339 --> 16:10.011
Nah.
Let him wait.

16:10.099 --> 16:11.930
Come here.
Sit down, I want to talk to you.

16:15.939 --> 16:18.499
Yeah.
What is it?

16:21.018 --> 16:23.532
You're really keeping that
mustache, huh?

16:23.618 --> 16:25.768
Why, you
don't like it?

16:25.858 --> 16:27.849
Nah, it just doesn't seem like
it goes with your face.

16:30.738 --> 16:32.296
Listen to me.

16:32.378 --> 16:34.937
The word's come
to me from the city

16:35.017 --> 16:37.326
that you're using
my name again, Josh.

16:37.417 --> 16:39.806
No, I...

16:39.937 --> 16:42.087
No, not really.
Not really?

16:42.177 --> 16:44.088
No, it was just, it was
just for the Westies.

16:44.177 --> 16:46.008
I didn't want to walk in there
for the deal,

16:46.096 --> 16:47.893
and with them thinking I'm
nobody, Roy.

16:47.976 --> 16:50.092
I'm not going to use Rosenthal.
It's too Jewish.

16:50.216 --> 16:54.209
You don't respect yourself to
use your own name?

16:54.296 --> 16:56.651
That only makes
you look weak.

16:56.736 --> 17:00.250
Listen to me. You and I,
we have a history together.

17:00.335 --> 17:02.326
That means
something to me.

17:02.415 --> 17:04.007
It means something
to me, too.

17:04.095 --> 17:05.813
Yeah?

17:05.895 --> 17:07.532
It won't happen again.

17:10.575 --> 17:12.929
All right, let's go see what this
guy's made of. Come on.

17:13.013 --> 17:14.367
Let's take this guy for a ride.

17:21.174 --> 17:25.723
Kulinski? Kolinsky?
Josh, pull over here.

17:29.053 --> 17:32.443
So... Kulinksi?
Kolinsky?

17:32.533 --> 17:34.046
How, how do you
say it? Who?

17:34.173 --> 17:36.209
Kuklinski.

17:36.293 --> 17:38.284
Kuklinski? With a... with a K?
Or is, what is that?

17:38.373 --> 17:40.488
A "C" or a "K"?
A "K."

17:40.572 --> 17:43.211
"Ski. " That's a "ski", "skis" are
Polish, right? You're a Polack?

17:43.292 --> 17:45.408
Yeah.
Yeah?

17:45.492 --> 17:47.369
Get away from the car.
Get away.

17:47.452 --> 17:48.601
Can you spare
some change?

17:48.692 --> 17:50.205
Get away.
Take a walk!

17:50.292 --> 17:51.565
Would it kill you
to give me a dime?

17:51.651 --> 17:54.324
Hey! Scumbag!

17:54.411 --> 17:57.687
Scicoli, here's a quarter.
You should go give it to him.

17:57.771 --> 17:59.568
Go give it to him.
What?

17:59.651 --> 18:01.801
Guy's not going to last
an hour in this weather.

18:01.931 --> 18:04.081
He's a fucking' reefer addict.
Have some heart. It's the holidays.

18:04.171 --> 18:08.049
Come on, Roy, why do
I got to freeze for a fucking skivatz?

18:08.130 --> 18:10.519
Here, give me the quarter.
I'll give him the quarter.

18:10.610 --> 18:14.888
I'll give him the fucking quarter.
Fucking give him a holiday quarter?

18:14.970 --> 18:16.403
The fucking skivatz.

18:16.490 --> 18:22.485
Kuklinski.
Kuklinski.

18:22.569 --> 18:23.922
There you go!

18:28.009 --> 18:29.727
Okay, I gave him
the quarter.

18:29.849 --> 18:32.806
Don't you feel
better about yourself?

18:32.888 --> 18:35.721
Yeah. You did something
nice for somebody.

18:35.808 --> 18:36.923
That's the fucking spirit.

18:41.248 --> 18:42.806
Look at that.

18:46.407 --> 18:48.682
Fucking guy's
cold as ice.

18:50.647 --> 18:52.763
Come on, you got to feel
something for somebody.

18:55.207 --> 18:56.481
Got a girlfriend?

18:56.567 --> 18:58.602
I'm married.

18:58.686 --> 19:02.281
Then why do you act like
you don't give a shit?

19:02.366 --> 19:03.401
What do you want?

19:10.205 --> 19:11.923
I'm closing
the porn lab.

19:13.565 --> 19:16.796
Sorry, but you're
out of a job.

19:16.885 --> 19:21.879
If you could follow orders,
you got everything to gain.

19:26.564 --> 19:30.443
Go put the bum
out of his misery.

19:32.684 --> 19:36.233
If you don't have it in you,
now's the time to say it.

20:10.161 --> 20:12.914
God almighty.
You got big hands.

20:13.001 --> 20:14.514
Are you a lumberjack
or something?

20:14.601 --> 20:17.592
No, I'm Polish.

20:18.800 --> 20:20.518
Mind if I sit down?

20:20.600 --> 20:23.478
It's your ass.
Put it where you want it.

20:30.439 --> 20:31.428
No.

20:44.878 --> 20:46.869
What the fuck is this?
What's he doing now?

20:46.958 --> 20:49.677
Shut the fuck up.
Just give him a second.

20:53.918 --> 20:58.513
Actually, I will have a drag.
What are you smoking? Camel...

21:06.237 --> 21:08.227
Come on.

21:16.636 --> 21:18.866
You all right?
Yeah.

21:18.956 --> 21:22.311
Not that big of a deal, is it?

21:22.395 --> 21:24.465
I know nobody forced
you to do anything

21:24.595 --> 21:26.233
but, I'm going to need a
guarantee of your loyalty.

21:26.315 --> 21:27.634
Give me the gun.

21:33.835 --> 21:35.187
This is for you.

21:39.114 --> 21:40.672
What you're going
to be doing is

21:40.754 --> 21:42.745
you'll be watching my back.

21:42.834 --> 21:44.187
You'll be collecting debts,
sending messages,

21:44.274 --> 21:46.663
whatever the messages are.

21:46.754 --> 21:50.109
But if I need you, Scicoli or Josh here
is going to get in contact with you.

21:50.193 --> 21:51.626
And payphones only.

21:54.353 --> 21:57.789
Now, you're going to deal with
whatever we can, for whatever reason.

22:01.232 --> 22:03.666
You're only going to work
for me, nobody else.

22:07.112 --> 22:08.101
You understand?

22:09.192 --> 22:10.181
Sure.

22:33.670 --> 22:36.025
Puh... please.
I got some money upstairs.

22:36.110 --> 22:40.341
I beg of you, please?
Please?

22:40.429 --> 22:42.579
Anything you want.
Anything, just...

23:27.986 --> 23:30.341
I give thanks for my
beautiful wife, Deborah.

23:30.426 --> 23:32.097
She means
the world to me.

23:32.185 --> 23:34.096
And she's carrying
our baby.

24:37.660 --> 24:39.696
Hey, honey.
Hi.

24:43.140 --> 24:47.133
Oh, sorry.
It's okay.

24:47.220 --> 24:49.131
Hi, Dad.
Take this.

24:49.220 --> 24:50.698
Thank you.
Is that everything?

24:50.779 --> 24:52.098
Yeah.
Perfect.

24:52.179 --> 24:54.056
Yeah.
You got it?

24:54.139 --> 24:55.413
Yeah, I got it.

24:55.539 --> 24:57.609
How was school?
It was good.

25:02.139 --> 25:03.935
That's good wine,
isn't it?

25:04.018 --> 25:05.610
For that price,
it better be.

25:05.698 --> 25:07.734
So how'd you guys meet?
You two?

25:07.818 --> 25:10.252
Oh, we met on a boat.
Really?

25:10.338 --> 25:12.488
Yeah. Like, big yacht,
one of those big fancy boats?

25:12.578 --> 25:14.808
The one you can eat and
drink anything you want on?

25:14.898 --> 25:16.774
So I'm in the bath
and I hear this voice

25:16.857 --> 25:18.893
from this other
stall, right?

25:19.057 --> 25:20.934
A little mousy voice.
Oh.

25:21.017 --> 25:23.167
And it goes, "Excuse me?"

25:23.297 --> 25:27.495
"Excuse me? Is there somebody in
the other stall?" I was locked in.

25:27.577 --> 25:30.044
Yeah, right. If you ask me, she
followed somebody in there.

25:30.136 --> 25:32.286
There was a huge line
for the girls room.

25:32.376 --> 25:34.128
How'd you meet Ritchie?

25:34.216 --> 25:37.094
Uh, it, it doesn't compare
to the bathroom story.

25:37.176 --> 25:39.770
I think it's pretty good.
Yeah?

25:39.856 --> 25:41.574
Yeah, tell us.
Come on.

25:41.656 --> 25:46.092
All right. Uh, I was working
across the street

25:46.175 --> 25:50.134
and, uh, Ritchie would come
over every break he had

25:50.255 --> 25:52.325
and he would bring me
flowers and candy.

25:52.415 --> 25:54.007
And then it got
really awkward,

25:54.135 --> 25:57.206
because I didn't
know who he was.

25:57.294 --> 26:01.685
And I started just making
any excuse I could to say no

26:01.774 --> 26:05.528
and then one day,
out of the blue he walks in

26:05.614 --> 26:08.174
and he tells me
I'm making a big mistake.

26:10.213 --> 26:12.249
And I didn't know
what to say,

26:12.333 --> 26:16.246
because he seemed
so convinced.

26:18.733 --> 26:20.325
So I went
out with him.

26:20.413 --> 26:22.687
All because he wouldn't
leave you alone?

26:22.772 --> 26:24.524
No.

26:24.612 --> 26:28.207
Because, he knew what
I needed more than I did.

26:29.612 --> 26:31.489
And now look at him.

26:31.572 --> 26:34.723
He goes from dubbing cartoons
to international banking.

26:36.251 --> 26:38.082
It's currency exchange.

26:38.211 --> 26:42.329
Cartoons? Is that what you
call porn these days? Porn?

26:42.411 --> 26:45.926
You're going to have
to excuse Terry as an idiot.

26:46.011 --> 26:47.922
When me and Ritchie
weren't looking

26:48.011 --> 26:50.763
he was using the equipment to
make porn for Adele here.

26:50.850 --> 26:52.886
I don't think there's anything
wrong with it.

26:52.970 --> 26:54.926
I mean, a little porn is healthy
now and then.

26:55.010 --> 26:56.602
You guys are
all perverts, okay?

26:56.690 --> 26:58.487
Hey, look at these.
These are our girls.

26:58.610 --> 27:00.328
Ah, look how much
they've grown.

27:00.410 --> 27:03.367
That's, um, Anabel,
and that's Betsy.

27:03.489 --> 27:04.717
So beautiful.
Now, Ritchie...

27:04.809 --> 27:06.447
Oh, they're gorgeous.
Yeah.

27:06.529 --> 27:08.520
What's currency exchange?

27:08.609 --> 27:13.080
That's when he watches the market,
like everybody else,

27:13.209 --> 27:15.563
and he looks for trends.
Okay.

27:15.648 --> 27:18.401
Like, um, natural
disaster or typhus,

27:18.488 --> 27:21.002
then he takes
advantage of inflation.

27:21.088 --> 27:23.522
And waits.
Is that right?

27:23.608 --> 27:25.599
That's pretty good.
Pretty good.

27:25.688 --> 27:28.155
You got all
the inside information?

27:28.247 --> 27:30.442
No. Vendor makes
the decisions.

27:30.527 --> 27:31.755
He's the one
who pays me.

27:31.847 --> 27:33.724
In Valentino suits?

27:33.807 --> 27:35.559
Uh, it's Bloomingdale's.

27:35.687 --> 27:37.359
Hey, this is actually...

27:37.447 --> 27:39.597
This is genuine Chinese silk.
It's nice, right?

27:39.687 --> 27:41.005
Did you pick it out for him?

27:41.086 --> 27:43.998
Absolutely not.

27:44.086 --> 27:47.317
It's a nice shirt, Terry.
Shows off your hair.

27:47.446 --> 27:50.119
Thank you. I spent a lot
of money on this shit.

27:50.206 --> 27:51.844
That is pretty awkward.

27:55.525 --> 27:57.436
That was really excellent.
Thanks a lot.

27:57.565 --> 27:59.920
Thank you.
Keep the change.

28:00.005 --> 28:01.882
See us again, sir.

28:02.045 --> 28:05.003
You got dinner?
Yeah, no skin off my nose.

28:05.085 --> 28:07.075
Thank you.
You're welcome.

28:07.164 --> 28:08.961
So what do you think?
About what?

28:09.044 --> 28:10.602
Olivia?

28:10.684 --> 28:12.242
She's all right.

28:12.324 --> 28:14.155
What is that supposed
to mean?

28:14.244 --> 28:17.156
Uh, you seem happy enough.
I'm happy for you. Okay.

28:17.244 --> 28:19.633
What do you want me to say?
She ain't my type.

28:19.724 --> 28:21.759
Well, I'm sorry you had
to be seen with us.

28:21.843 --> 28:24.482
What's your problem, Dino?
Forgot already?

28:24.563 --> 28:28.078
You couldn't even talk to a girl
unless I made the first move.

28:28.163 --> 28:29.994
I suppose. You're my best friend,
Ritchie.

28:30.123 --> 28:33.035
That's true. So I just think
about you all the time.

28:33.123 --> 28:35.238
I wonder how you're doing,
how your family is.

28:35.322 --> 28:36.835
You know, I used
to take care of you.

28:36.922 --> 28:38.514
Now I have to call
your wife

28:38.602 --> 28:40.672
every time I want to see you?
Really?

28:40.762 --> 28:43.196
I'm doing great.

28:43.282 --> 28:45.318
All right, that's good.
I'm sorry.

28:45.402 --> 28:46.880
Look, I, really,
I'm sorry.

28:47.001 --> 28:48.593
It's just that
I miss you, you know?

28:48.681 --> 28:50.797
It's okay.
Yeah.

28:50.921 --> 28:52.718
Can I have a hug?
Give me a hug.

28:52.881 --> 28:54.792
A hug? Jesus Christ.
Why are you hugging my husband?

28:54.881 --> 28:57.236
My best friend?
Where did Olivia go?

28:57.321 --> 28:58.754
She's in the restroom.

28:58.881 --> 29:00.233
She's all locked in there.
Really?

29:09.080 --> 29:10.308
Try it.

29:11.920 --> 29:13.830
It's the purest shit
you can find.

29:17.919 --> 29:19.796
It's good.
Like I told you.

29:19.879 --> 29:21.676
Same deal
we spoke about?

29:21.759 --> 29:26.274
Yeah, unless you want to
give me more money. No.

29:26.358 --> 29:30.033
Here.
We should count it.

30:00.956 --> 30:03.709
Oh! Oh!

30:03.796 --> 30:06.070
Oh.

30:14.835 --> 30:16.314
Oh.

30:16.395 --> 30:18.589
Oh, shit.

30:18.674 --> 30:20.949
Mom? Betsy woke me up.
Son of a bitch.

30:21.034 --> 30:22.945
Uh...
Go back to bed.

30:23.034 --> 30:24.911
She had a bad dream.
This is not fair.

30:28.234 --> 30:29.223
Oh.

30:30.514 --> 30:33.152
Hold on.

30:37.993 --> 30:39.346
Hm.

30:39.433 --> 30:41.867
All right.

30:41.953 --> 30:43.830
What the hell
is going on?

30:45.472 --> 30:46.985
Can I come
in the bed, please?

30:57.112 --> 30:59.671
Secretary of State
Henry Kissinger says

30:59.791 --> 31:01.747
he will ask
Congress for funds.

31:01.831 --> 31:04.186
They're coming
back from Vietnam?

31:04.271 --> 31:05.829
Yeah.

31:05.911 --> 31:08.630
Dad?
What?

31:08.711 --> 31:10.860
Sister Marjorie says
it's God's will.

31:10.950 --> 31:12.702
What's God's will?

31:12.790 --> 31:15.588
The people who died in Vietnam.

31:15.670 --> 31:17.786
That doesn't really make
sense to me.

31:17.870 --> 31:21.829
Well, you know, honey,
there's just too many people in the world

31:21.910 --> 31:23.581
for God to care
about everyone.

31:23.669 --> 31:25.739
So that's why we look
after each other.

31:25.829 --> 31:30.584
Yeah, your mom's right.
God's got nothing to do with it.

31:30.669 --> 31:32.500
There's nothing else on?

31:32.589 --> 31:34.386
They got school, Ritchie.
They got school real early.

31:34.469 --> 31:36.187
Mom's the boss.

31:36.269 --> 31:38.418
Can I stay in here with you?

31:38.508 --> 31:40.305
Not tonight.

31:40.388 --> 31:42.458
Come on.
You'll be all right.

31:42.548 --> 31:45.142
Come on, girls.

31:45.228 --> 31:47.458
No more bad dreams.
All right.

31:47.548 --> 31:50.061
All right, goodnight.
Love you.

31:50.147 --> 31:52.217
Love you. Just count sheep.
That's what I do.

31:52.307 --> 31:54.059
I'll try it.

31:59.347 --> 32:02.578
You're the one who wanted to
send them to Catholic school.

32:02.666 --> 32:06.136
I was an altar boy.

32:06.226 --> 32:09.138
Oh, yeah.
Come here.

32:44.143 --> 32:45.895
Hey, Jimmy.

32:45.983 --> 32:47.257
Hey, Josh.

32:49.223 --> 32:50.702
Who's up there?

32:50.783 --> 32:52.933
The Gambino guy,
Leo Marks.

32:53.063 --> 32:54.052
Leo?

32:54.143 --> 32:55.177
Yeah.

32:58.222 --> 33:00.690
You know something, Leo?

33:00.782 --> 33:04.331
One of these days I'm not going
to let you in here anymore.

33:04.422 --> 33:10.257
I'm starting to associate your
face with bad news. Salud.

33:10.341 --> 33:14.573
I got where I am by doing
what's right, Roy. Salud.

33:14.661 --> 33:18.256
Oh, yeah?
Is that how it works?

33:18.341 --> 33:20.650
You know, I'm the one
delivering the message.

33:21.980 --> 33:22.969
Not receiving it.

33:24.980 --> 33:28.768
All right, well,
what's the message?

33:28.860 --> 33:31.169
Rosenthal steals
half a mil in cocaine,

33:31.260 --> 33:32.852
then shoots
the couriers.

33:34.939 --> 33:36.338
You're being
held responsible

33:36.419 --> 33:38.330
by the Cubans
for his actions.

33:38.419 --> 33:40.649
How do you figure that?
How the fuck am I responsible?

33:40.739 --> 33:45.688
He goes around throwing your name.
Demeo this, Demeo that.

33:45.819 --> 33:48.127
Starts a war, so now everyone
thinks you're involved.

33:48.218 --> 33:50.368
He was just trying
to help me out, Leo!

33:50.458 --> 33:54.133
Help you out?
Ha!

33:54.218 --> 33:58.370
Then it's your fault you made
him feel sorry for you.

33:58.498 --> 34:00.295
You want to be friends
with the Gambinos,

34:00.418 --> 34:02.806
then be real with me.

34:02.897 --> 34:07.607
I understand you got this relationship
with Rosenthal.

34:07.697 --> 34:10.052
But the couriers he killed
and stole from,

34:10.177 --> 34:13.328
they were linked
to the Callies, Roy.

34:13.417 --> 34:15.804
Nothing gets forgotten.

34:15.896 --> 34:19.650
Leo, you're asking me
to kill Rosenthal?

34:19.735 --> 34:22.409
Why don't you stop asking questions
you know the answers to?

34:22.496 --> 34:24.327
I took the kid
from the streets!

34:24.416 --> 34:26.327
I raised him like he was
one of my own.

34:26.416 --> 34:28.087
Then that's
your problem.

34:28.175 --> 34:30.688
Kid goes around telling
everybody he's your son

34:30.775 --> 34:32.447
and they hold the...
the father accountable.

34:32.534 --> 34:34.411
They were fucking coked out
delivery boys!

34:34.574 --> 34:36.213
Who gives a fuck?
Who gives a shit about them?

34:36.295 --> 34:38.331
But that's
not the point.

34:38.415 --> 34:41.087
You understand? They'll come
after you and him no matter what.

34:41.214 --> 34:44.650
Do you fucking understand that in
your fucking thick head? Yes! Fuck me.

34:44.774 --> 34:48.527
You get what I'm telling you?
Yeah, I get it.

34:48.614 --> 34:52.289
Even people you consider friends
will come after him.

34:52.373 --> 34:54.250
You got
that friend, Marty.

34:54.333 --> 34:56.527
What about Marty?

34:56.612 --> 34:58.365
He already started spreading
the word where to find him.

34:58.453 --> 35:01.445
This is one big fucking mess
we don't need, Roy.

35:03.253 --> 35:05.209
Clean it up.

35:08.012 --> 35:11.482
The property is in Vernon and he's
asking Atlantic City price.

35:11.572 --> 35:13.688
Dad, we got to go.

35:13.772 --> 35:15.205
Gambling is going
legal any day.

35:15.292 --> 35:17.169
They're condominiums,
not a casino.

35:17.252 --> 35:19.128
You got to understand,
it's a seller's market.

35:19.211 --> 35:21.122
With the rumors of
gambling going legal,

35:21.211 --> 35:23.088
property values are going
through the roof.

35:23.171 --> 35:25.605
Tell them I'm not going
above 150, all right?

35:25.691 --> 35:27.363
You're changing
your tie.

35:27.451 --> 35:29.089
He won't give me the time of day.

35:29.171 --> 35:30.684
I'll have to call you back later.

35:30.771 --> 35:32.761
All right.
Take care.

35:32.850 --> 35:35.318
Hey, I'm going shopping.
Need anything?

35:35.410 --> 35:37.162
More cologne?

35:37.290 --> 35:39.599
What, again?
Yeah.

35:39.690 --> 35:41.726
You got a girlfriend
I don't know about?

35:41.810 --> 35:43.607
No, it's for you, baby.
Mom.

35:43.690 --> 35:45.441
Have a great day
at school, sweetie.

35:45.529 --> 35:47.167
All right, bye.
Bye.

35:48.329 --> 35:50.047
Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah.

35:50.129 --> 35:51.448
Look at that.

35:51.529 --> 35:54.168
Let's go, Bets!

35:57.929 --> 35:59.566
Don't take any crap
from any nuns.

35:59.648 --> 36:01.001
Okay, I won't.
Coming.

36:01.088 --> 36:02.157
Come here.
Bye.

36:02.248 --> 36:03.522
Love you.
Love you.

36:03.608 --> 36:04.677
Love you, too.
All right.

36:04.768 --> 36:05.803
See you after school.

36:41.325 --> 36:44.283
There's no sound on this,
but tell me your name.

36:44.365 --> 36:46.276
Alex.
Alex.

36:46.405 --> 36:50.114
Very nice to meet you, Alex.
I'm Marty.

36:50.205 --> 36:52.923
Very nice.

36:53.004 --> 36:55.472
Ah, look at that.
Bare your soul.

36:55.564 --> 36:57.953
Okay, you like that?

36:58.044 --> 36:59.033
I like that.

37:30.161 --> 37:32.117
No! No!

37:32.201 --> 37:34.715
Yes, he asked me
about Rosenthal,

37:34.801 --> 37:36.359
if I'd seen
him lately

37:36.441 --> 37:41.515
and I said not in a while!
That's all.

37:41.601 --> 37:44.717
That's... yes, that's all.

37:48.560 --> 37:51.677
Of course, yes.

37:51.760 --> 37:56.310
I swear to God. Yes.

37:58.119 --> 38:00.189
As soon as possible.

38:00.279 --> 38:02.315
Thank you, Roy.

38:02.399 --> 38:03.468
He wants to talk to you.

38:07.879 --> 38:09.948
Yeah?

38:10.038 --> 38:13.155
Right.

38:13.238 --> 38:16.628
Ah. Guess everyone has
a soft spot, right?

38:16.718 --> 38:18.197
Guess so.

38:18.278 --> 38:20.633
Hey, what the fuck's going on?

38:20.718 --> 38:21.867
He changed his mind.

38:21.958 --> 38:23.788
No, no, no, no.
Look,

38:23.877 --> 38:26.869
Rosenthal's my best friend.
I would never say anything.

38:26.997 --> 38:28.476
Not my problem.

38:28.557 --> 38:30.388
Well, do... no! No! Not...
Please don't!

38:30.477 --> 38:33.389
God, please!
God, please!

38:33.477 --> 38:35.308
What, are you praying?

38:35.397 --> 38:38.194
God, please! Please!

38:38.276 --> 38:39.914
You really believe that?

38:39.996 --> 38:41.952
You think God will come
down and save you?

38:46.156 --> 38:51.024
All right.
I'll give you some time.

38:51.115 --> 38:53.345
Pray to God.

38:53.435 --> 38:54.948
Tell him to come
down and stop me.

39:01.035 --> 39:02.228
Go ahead.

39:17.353 --> 39:18.468
Our Father...

39:18.553 --> 39:22.387
Our Father...
Mm-hm.

39:22.473 --> 39:25.067
All right, then.

39:25.153 --> 39:29.589
All right, all right, all right.

39:29.672 --> 39:32.744
I'm not
feeling nothing.

39:35.392 --> 39:36.791
Nothing at all.

39:42.511 --> 39:44.547
Harder.

39:44.631 --> 39:46.622
What? I'm...

39:46.711 --> 39:48.542
This your last chance.

40:03.150 --> 40:05.744
No. No. Don't.

40:08.989 --> 40:11.867
I think God's busy.

40:48.706 --> 40:53.382
Please... please,
I didn't see anything.

40:53.506 --> 40:55.258
I'm not Shannon.
I'm Alex.

40:55.346 --> 40:57.018
She's his girl usually.
I don't know him. I...

40:57.106 --> 40:58.585
Doesn't fucking matter!

41:01.345 --> 41:03.017
I promise
I won't say anything.

41:03.105 --> 41:07.974
Shh. How old are you?

41:08.065 --> 41:09.578
Seventeen.

41:09.665 --> 41:13.816
Get out. Come on.
Come on. Get dressed.

41:17.064 --> 41:18.577
Come on.

41:23.904 --> 41:24.939
Better hurry up.

41:30.503 --> 41:31.492
Come on.

41:33.943 --> 41:35.012
Just get out of here.

41:37.503 --> 41:39.572
Hey, Polack.
What?

41:39.662 --> 41:42.893
Let's take a ride.
Why?

41:42.982 --> 41:46.099
Suit yourself.

41:54.261 --> 41:56.252
What the hell
are you up to?

41:56.341 --> 41:57.694
Guess the man didn't
want to take any chances,

41:57.781 --> 42:00.056
putting us both
on the same mark.

42:00.141 --> 42:03.133
Kuklinski, right?
Yeah.

42:03.221 --> 42:08.419
Robert Pronge.
Introductions are long overdue.

42:08.540 --> 42:10.019
Who's the girl?
I don't know her.

42:10.100 --> 42:11.533
And you let her go?

42:11.660 --> 42:13.810
I don't kill
women or children.

42:13.900 --> 42:15.128
You're going to kill
your reputation.

42:17.380 --> 42:18.573
What are you doing?

42:18.659 --> 42:20.650
She saw my face.

42:26.939 --> 42:28.338
Stop the car.

42:29.899 --> 42:31.536
Stop the car now.

42:31.618 --> 42:33.210
The odds are against you.

42:33.298 --> 42:34.492
You shoot the captain,
the ship goes down.

42:36.138 --> 42:37.253
Stop the fucking car!

42:43.938 --> 42:46.656
Aw, what the fuck
is the matter with you?

42:48.297 --> 42:50.765
Christ! Are you
fucking nuts?

42:50.857 --> 42:52.973
Got to keep
my reputation.

42:53.057 --> 42:54.888
You owe me a window,
Polack.

42:54.977 --> 42:56.535
Yeah, I'll pay you back
someday.

42:58.896 --> 43:01.171
You want to get the
fuck out of the way?

43:07.856 --> 43:10.733
Stupid motherfucker.

43:22.575 --> 43:24.166
Vegetables are good
for you.

43:24.254 --> 43:26.927
Didn't your mom
ever tell you that?

43:27.014 --> 43:28.845
No.

43:28.934 --> 43:33.291
No? What about leaving
witnesses at a murder scene?

43:33.374 --> 43:36.843
She forget to tell you
that one, too?

43:36.933 --> 43:40.846
I guess she didn't
give me much advice.

43:40.933 --> 43:43.447
She was a kid, Roy.

43:43.533 --> 43:45.603
That's right.

43:45.693 --> 43:48.207
Young girls are notorious for keeping
their fucking mouths shut.

43:48.333 --> 43:50.243
She doesn't even know me.
They got nothing' on me.

43:50.332 --> 43:51.811
Can I do something?
No.

43:51.892 --> 43:52.881
Jimmy.

43:57.092 --> 44:00.721
Thing is? I told you
to zip it the fuck up.

44:00.852 --> 44:03.570
I did. I'm getting
paranoid, Polack.

44:03.651 --> 44:05.687
And it's all because he
wanted to help me out.

44:05.771 --> 44:07.489
The Gambinos
want to hurt me.

44:07.571 --> 44:10.369
The Callies want my whole
fucking family dead.

44:10.451 --> 44:12.840
The other day, there's a car
that I don't recognize,

44:12.931 --> 44:14.683
it's parked
outside of my house.

44:14.771 --> 44:16.328
Looked Cuban enough,
piece of shit car,

44:16.410 --> 44:18.002
dark skin,
I think one thing.

44:18.090 --> 44:20.081
So I panic.

44:20.170 --> 44:21.762
Turns out it's a fucking
Puerto Rican kid

44:21.850 --> 44:23.761
selling vacuum cleaners

44:23.850 --> 44:28.162
to help pay his way through college.
You get it now?

44:28.250 --> 44:31.082
I'm not going to do a thing
until this is resolved.

44:31.169 --> 44:33.683
For now,
you're decommissioned.

44:33.769 --> 44:38.968
We all got to make sacrifices
to stay alive.

44:39.089 --> 44:41.239
I need to work, Roy.
I'm good at what I do.

44:41.329 --> 44:42.886
If that were true,
then I wouldn't have

44:43.008 --> 44:45.283
any fucking loose ends,
now, would I?

44:45.368 --> 44:48.724
Nothing is done in my name
until we figure this out. Nothing.

44:48.848 --> 44:50.042
Let me do something
on the side.

44:50.128 --> 44:52.722
Not a fucking thing.

44:52.808 --> 44:54.924
Roy...
No. Nothing.

44:57.367 --> 44:59.198
Tell me
that you understand.

44:59.287 --> 45:02.836
I brought you into this,
and now I'm letting you go.

45:02.927 --> 45:04.246
I don't fucking
hear you, Polack.

45:04.327 --> 45:05.646
I understand.

45:15.646 --> 45:17.841
Here's some money
to hold you over.

45:17.926 --> 45:19.962
Josh, let's get
the fuck out of here.

45:37.044 --> 45:38.033
What?

45:40.244 --> 45:42.394
Hello?

45:42.524 --> 45:44.719
This is a call
from Hudson County Jail.

45:44.804 --> 45:46.954
If you'd like to take the call,
please remain on the line.

45:53.363 --> 45:54.796
Who was that?

46:18.001 --> 46:19.320
There you go.

46:19.401 --> 46:21.995
Thanks.

46:26.880 --> 46:28.359
Ritchie.

46:28.480 --> 46:32.359
What is it,
almost 11 years?

46:32.440 --> 46:35.750
How are you doing, Joey?

46:35.840 --> 46:39.515
You're looking
at it.

46:39.600 --> 46:43.194
I've got bed bugs.

46:43.279 --> 46:45.588
You got big.

46:45.679 --> 46:47.874
Yeah.

46:51.559 --> 46:54.595
Probably more pissed
I killed that dog than the girl, huh?

46:57.358 --> 46:59.508
She was 12 years old.

46:59.598 --> 47:04.956
Wasn't my fault.
She started screaming.

47:05.038 --> 47:08.393
After all these years,
you got someplace to go?

47:08.517 --> 47:10.508
Yeah, I told my kids I'd
take them roller skating.

47:10.597 --> 47:14.351
You're a family man now?

47:14.437 --> 47:16.155
That makes me an uncle?

47:16.277 --> 47:17.630
What, girls, boys, what?

47:17.717 --> 47:19.116
Two daughters.

47:19.237 --> 47:21.955
What are their names?

47:22.036 --> 47:25.233
Anabel and Betsy.

47:25.316 --> 47:27.671
Come on.

47:27.756 --> 47:30.190
You and me, Ritchie, we're too fucked
in the head for family.

47:30.276 --> 47:31.425
You know that.

47:31.516 --> 47:34.632
Speak for yourself.

47:34.715 --> 47:36.273
Think you're different
than me, huh?

47:36.355 --> 47:38.823
I don't have to think about it.

47:38.915 --> 47:40.712
Oh, yeah?

47:40.795 --> 47:42.513
What about
those stray dogs?

47:42.635 --> 47:44.512
The ones you tied
to the express train?

47:44.635 --> 47:46.704
You going to tell that story
to your daughters?

47:46.794 --> 47:51.822
What about that boy?
What was his name, uh, Frank?

47:51.914 --> 47:54.951
You caved his head in with
that shower pole. Remember?

47:55.034 --> 47:58.821
Yeah, I saw you doing it, but I didn't
say nothing 'cause I'm your brother.

47:58.913 --> 48:00.949
I don't want you to call
the house anymore.

48:01.033 --> 48:03.388
Why?

48:03.473 --> 48:06.545
Because I don't want to have to
explain to people who you are.

48:12.192 --> 48:15.184
What if I do, huh?

48:15.272 --> 48:16.671
What if I want
to be an uncle?

48:16.752 --> 48:18.504
U ncle Joey?

48:18.592 --> 48:20.947
Hey! I'm sorry,
all right?

48:21.032 --> 48:23.102
Hey, Ritchie, please.
I need you.

48:23.192 --> 48:25.580
I need your help.
Come back.

48:32.831 --> 48:37.427
The old man used to count them
out in Polish, remember?

48:37.511 --> 48:43.460
Every punch he landed,
you counted, too.

48:43.550 --> 48:45.745
He got so pissed,
he forgot about me.

48:45.830 --> 48:47.661
What do you need, Joey?

48:47.750 --> 48:50.105
A lawyer.

48:50.190 --> 48:52.225
There's a guy in Trenton,
he said he'd take me on.

48:52.309 --> 48:53.947
He wants
ten grand to start.

48:54.029 --> 48:55.667
I don't have that kind of cash.

48:55.749 --> 48:57.740
Well, do you know
anybody that does?

48:57.869 --> 49:00.258
Joey, look, it don't matter.
You killed a little girl.

49:00.349 --> 49:02.544
Nobody's going to forgive
you, okay?

49:02.629 --> 49:07.224
Yeah, I know I did.
I know.

49:11.828 --> 49:13.102
A wife?

49:13.188 --> 49:14.587
Fucking kids?

49:14.668 --> 49:16.863
Who are you kidding?

49:16.948 --> 49:19.302
You're going to end up
just like me, right here.

49:19.387 --> 49:21.423
So go fuck you
and your fucking family.

49:21.507 --> 49:22.701
Take care.

49:22.787 --> 49:24.539
Hey! Where you going?

49:24.667 --> 49:26.623
I can't stand it!
Richard!

49:26.707 --> 49:29.346
Don't leave me again,
you motherfucker!

49:29.427 --> 49:31.098
Goddamn! You fuck!

49:31.186 --> 49:33.381
Get the fuck off me!

49:33.466 --> 49:36.663
Fuck you!
Son of a bitch!

49:43.425 --> 49:44.824
Hey, Daddy.

49:49.865 --> 49:52.095
Hi, Mom!
Hi! You're doing great, girls.

49:52.185 --> 49:53.220
Hey, girls.

49:56.025 --> 49:59.016
What's going
on with Ritchie?

49:59.104 --> 50:01.015
I see he got
the day off again.

50:01.104 --> 50:04.255
Yeah, off,
I don't know about off.

50:04.344 --> 50:07.381
He seems to be making his
own schedule these days.

50:07.464 --> 50:09.182
You know what I mean?

50:09.264 --> 50:11.902
You know, you can ask him
what's going on, Deb.

50:11.983 --> 50:14.895
You're his wife.
It's got to be a work issue.

50:15.023 --> 50:16.854
And if it is?

50:16.983 --> 50:19.497
If your husband's been laid off,
it's your business.

50:19.583 --> 50:21.335
You're the one holding
down the house.

50:21.423 --> 50:24.095
That's all I'm saying.

50:32.462 --> 50:33.531
So much fun.

50:36.901 --> 50:39.540
You looked great.
Thank you.

50:39.621 --> 50:41.179
You look great, too.
Thanks.

50:41.261 --> 50:42.660
So much fun.

50:48.421 --> 50:51.093
Christ!
You all right?

50:51.180 --> 50:52.977
Yeah. You okay honey?

50:53.100 --> 50:54.818
Yeah.

50:54.900 --> 50:57.095
You didn't hit
your head?

50:57.180 --> 50:59.011
Hey! You going to get on out
and take a look at it?

50:59.100 --> 51:01.375
Why don't you just
get back in your car?

51:01.460 --> 51:02.892
Hey, fuck you, lady!

51:02.979 --> 51:04.651
Oh, Ritchie.
Ritchie!

51:04.779 --> 51:07.009
All right, all right,
all right, sorry, sorry!

51:07.099 --> 51:08.293
Hey, you hit my car!

51:08.379 --> 51:09.698
Get in
your fucking car.

51:09.779 --> 51:10.768
Peace, man.

51:16.738 --> 51:18.376
Son of a bitch.

51:18.498 --> 51:21.092
You know what? Fuck you!
And fuck your family!

51:24.698 --> 51:27.007
Ritchie! Ritchie!

51:28.977 --> 51:31.775
Stop the car!

51:31.857 --> 51:33.893
What are you doing?
Stop!

51:36.057 --> 51:37.854
Stop the car!

51:39.777 --> 51:41.051
Dad!

51:44.456 --> 51:48.244
Daddy, stop it!
Stop!

51:48.336 --> 51:51.328
Dad, stop the car!

51:53.416 --> 51:55.167
Dad!

51:57.535 --> 52:00.333
Dad, stop, please!
Daddy! Please!

52:02.655 --> 52:04.691
Just, just stop the car!

52:04.775 --> 52:06.333
Daddy, stop it!
Dad, stop!

52:08.174 --> 52:10.813
Stop the car! Dad!

52:18.094 --> 52:19.846
What is wrong with you?

52:19.974 --> 52:21.850
I'm sorry.

52:21.973 --> 52:24.487
Are you okay?
She's okay.

52:24.573 --> 52:27.007
She's okay.

53:09.570 --> 53:13.039
The Golden Nugget
in Atlantic City.

53:13.129 --> 53:15.848
You really have
to see it to believe it.

53:20.609 --> 53:23.248
What are you doing up?

53:23.329 --> 53:25.081
Can't sleep.

53:28.448 --> 53:29.881
Anything on?

53:29.968 --> 53:32.084
Not really.

53:43.887 --> 53:47.197
What's going on,
Ritchie?

53:47.287 --> 53:49.517
Please, talk to me.

53:49.607 --> 53:53.599
I'm all right.

53:53.726 --> 53:57.162
That's it?

53:57.246 --> 54:01.080
The condo prices
in AC skyrocketed.

54:01.166 --> 54:03.919
You know that's not
what I'm talking about.

54:04.006 --> 54:06.917
I just lost my temper.
So, what?

54:07.005 --> 54:11.920
Yeah. Yeah. That's been
happening a lot lately.

54:12.005 --> 54:13.882
The guy told you
to go fuck yourself.

54:13.965 --> 54:15.318
You think I'm going
to take that?

54:15.405 --> 54:17.396
So you put
everyone at risk?

54:17.485 --> 54:20.556
That's...

54:20.644 --> 54:22.874
that's not what
I meant to do.

54:23.004 --> 54:25.279
I said, "I'm sorry. "

54:25.364 --> 54:27.116
I don't want to talk
about it anymore.

54:27.204 --> 54:32.402
Ritchie, you-you-you
got to just talk to me.

54:32.483 --> 54:34.075
Got to tell me.

54:34.163 --> 54:38.759
You and me, we've been
through enough.

54:38.843 --> 54:40.913
We got too much
good here

54:41.003 --> 54:43.563
for you to be acting
this way.

54:43.683 --> 54:46.321
What way?
Like you don't care anymore.

54:49.842 --> 54:53.118
So that's what you think?
I don't care anymore?

54:53.202 --> 54:56.239
I see. I don't get
the benefit of the doubt?

54:56.322 --> 54:58.198
Really?
Of course, you do.

54:58.281 --> 55:00.511
I buy you all this shit,
I buy you this fucking house?

55:00.601 --> 55:02.159
I buy you
your fucking jewelry.

55:02.241 --> 55:04.232
I send the girls
to private school!

55:04.321 --> 55:06.152
Do not raise your voice
to me, Richard.

55:06.281 --> 55:09.353
"Richard?" What happened to "Ritchie?"
I don't know.

55:09.441 --> 55:11.396
Yeah? Well, fuck you!

55:11.480 --> 55:13.436
I don't give a shit what you
fucking think about anything!

55:15.320 --> 55:16.719
Fuck!

55:20.200 --> 55:22.395
Oh, Richard!

55:22.480 --> 55:24.947
Richard!

55:27.039 --> 55:28.677
I'm so sorry.

55:34.719 --> 55:36.834
Please. I'm so sorry.
Deb...

55:41.718 --> 55:44.186
This is it, okay?

55:44.278 --> 55:48.749
You and the girls.

55:48.838 --> 55:52.955
That is all I care about
in the whole fucking world.

55:53.037 --> 55:55.107
Do you understand me?
Yeah.

55:55.197 --> 55:56.755
That's it.

55:56.837 --> 56:01.627
I know. I know.
I do. I know. I know.

56:01.717 --> 56:06.836
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.

56:06.916 --> 56:07.985
I'm so sorry.

56:30.954 --> 56:32.182
There you go.
Thank you.

56:35.074 --> 56:38.191
All right, kids, that's it.
Go on home. We're closed.

56:38.274 --> 56:39.992
No, wait.
Please, Mr. Freezy.

56:40.074 --> 56:42.144
My little brother wants
a strawberry shortcake.

56:42.234 --> 56:43.985
My mom gave us three dollars.
Is that enough?

56:44.073 --> 56:45.426
Yeah, it's on the house.
Get out of here.

56:45.513 --> 56:46.548
Thank you.

56:52.953 --> 56:55.671
So, is it my lucky day,
or my last?

56:55.752 --> 56:56.741
You got a second?

57:01.792 --> 57:03.350
So who do you work for?

57:03.432 --> 57:05.150
I work for everyone.

57:05.232 --> 57:09.110
Gambinos, Luchezis,
Pananos, you name it.

57:09.191 --> 57:11.500
What about you?
Red with the arrow through the eye?

57:11.591 --> 57:13.183
That was you, wasn't it?

57:13.271 --> 57:14.670
That's fucking legendary.

57:14.751 --> 57:16.628
Was that
target practice?

57:16.711 --> 57:18.144
Somebody wants
somebody dead,

57:18.231 --> 57:19.459
who am I
to question it?

57:23.110 --> 57:26.625
Yeah. Remember her?
The cutie you let slide?

57:26.710 --> 57:28.587
Force-fed her
a puffer fish.

57:28.670 --> 57:31.742
Been frozen since the last
time I saw you.

57:31.830 --> 57:34.264
Three more months
I'll dump her up in Pittsburgh.

57:34.390 --> 57:38.746
There's a crack out there, sold his meds,
started torching bodies.

57:38.829 --> 57:42.219
I'll do the same to her.
Pin it on that crazy fucker.

57:42.309 --> 57:44.743
Roy put you up to that?

57:44.829 --> 57:48.707
You know he did. Hm.
Let me show you something.

57:48.788 --> 57:51.586
Coroners are lazier
than cops.

57:51.668 --> 57:53.420
If it looks like
a heart attack, it is.

57:53.508 --> 57:56.181
Arsenic?
Pure cyanide.

57:56.268 --> 58:01.136
Careful. It's rare.
Pricey. Comes as a powder.

58:01.227 --> 58:02.706
You can liquefy it,

58:02.787 --> 58:04.982
spray it, bake it
in a fucking cake.

58:05.067 --> 58:08.776
Pour it in a guy's shirt, he's dead
before you can say I'm sorry.

58:08.867 --> 58:11.381
No more stake outs.
I can do that anywhere.

58:11.507 --> 58:15.465
I don't have any friends,
so it makes it easy.

58:15.546 --> 58:18.618
I only feel alone
around other people.

58:18.706 --> 58:20.219
Couldn't be truer.

58:20.346 --> 58:22.064
You got a family?

58:22.146 --> 58:26.378
My son's a decent kid,
despite his cunt mother.

58:26.466 --> 58:30.094
Well, here's
my situation.

58:30.185 --> 58:33.177
I'm currently unemployable.

58:33.265 --> 58:36.098
Except maybe by the rat
who turned me in.

58:38.665 --> 58:41.417
Look, Polack,
I'm good at my job.

58:41.504 --> 58:42.823
Just because
you fucked up

58:42.904 --> 58:44.223
doesn't mean
I owe you shit.

58:44.304 --> 58:46.022
I'll make it
worth your while.

58:46.104 --> 58:48.857
You take care of the details,
I do the hit.

58:48.944 --> 58:53.255
No risk.
We split it 50-50.

58:53.343 --> 58:55.220
You trying to be
my partner?

58:55.303 --> 58:59.615
No. This is short term.

58:59.703 --> 59:03.457
Roy's got to think
I'm retired.

59:03.543 --> 59:05.374
You're Polish, I'm Dutch Irish.

59:05.463 --> 59:07.214
We're not exactly
membership material.

59:07.302 --> 59:08.815
We might as well look
out for each other. Mm-hm.

59:27.821 --> 59:29.334
Going to need
more shelves.

59:31.581 --> 59:33.252
Mr. Kuklinski,

59:33.340 --> 59:34.773
it's good to see
you all again.

59:34.860 --> 59:36.339
Good to see
you, George.

59:36.460 --> 59:38.690
My, your ladies
look radiant tonight.

59:38.780 --> 59:39.929
Don't they always?

59:40.020 --> 59:42.773
Indeed. Your table.

59:42.860 --> 59:44.088
Thanks, George.

59:44.180 --> 59:45.613
My pleasure, sir.

59:45.699 --> 59:47.849
June 2nd, 1979?

59:47.939 --> 59:49.691
Fuck, does it feel
like two years

59:49.779 --> 59:52.418
since we laid
this fucking steak?

59:52.499 --> 59:54.251
I don't remember.

59:54.339 --> 59:56.295
Going to take a while
to defrost.

59:56.379 --> 59:57.858
Nah, 24 hours
they'll be good.

59:59.978 --> 01:00:01.855
So I went
into your office

01:00:01.938 --> 01:00:03.929
to get your jacket
to take to the cleaners

01:00:04.018 --> 01:00:06.657
and there was a lot of money
in that pocket.

01:00:10.218 --> 01:00:14.768
I sold high
on 300,000 francs.

01:00:14.857 --> 01:00:17.325
That's about
thirty grand.

01:00:17.417 --> 01:00:18.975
Thirty grand?
Mm-hm.

01:00:19.057 --> 01:00:20.092
Wow.

01:00:22.657 --> 01:00:26.444
I'm really proud of you,
Ritchie. I really am. Hm.

01:00:36.136 --> 01:00:38.569
Hey.
Hey.

01:00:38.655 --> 01:00:41.613
Hey, Roy.
How are you doing, Leo?

01:00:43.855 --> 01:00:46.210
Have a seat, Josh.

01:00:46.295 --> 01:00:49.571
Yeah, yeah,
what's going on?

01:01:03.094 --> 01:01:05.766
Roy?

01:01:05.853 --> 01:01:08.048
You can't, Roy.
You, you can't.

01:01:08.133 --> 01:01:10.408
Wait, wait, Roy.
Come on, now.

01:01:10.493 --> 01:01:12.404
Listen, listen. I'll, I'll,
I'll disappear, okay?

01:01:12.493 --> 01:01:14.768
No one will ever hear
from me.

01:01:14.853 --> 01:01:18.049
Roy, Roy, hold- hold- hold, fuck!
Roy. No, you can't. Sorry, Josh.

01:01:18.132 --> 01:01:19.770
Oh!

01:01:19.852 --> 01:01:21.683
I can't! I can't!

01:01:21.772 --> 01:01:24.161
What the fuck are you doing here,
for Christ's sake?

01:01:24.292 --> 01:01:26.852
All right, all right, all right!
Stop! Just stop! Get off!

01:01:26.932 --> 01:01:29.082
Get the fuck off me!

01:01:29.172 --> 01:01:31.605
Just get... You don't fucking touch me,
you fucking son of a bitch!

01:01:31.731 --> 01:01:33.767
Will you leave?
Just go! It's done.

01:01:37.171 --> 01:01:39.241
Just fucking go.

01:01:39.331 --> 01:01:41.686
You're done.
You're a dead man, Scicoli.

01:02:41.446 --> 01:02:43.323
It's got to look
like a natural death.

01:02:43.406 --> 01:02:45.078
Like he choked
on a steak,

01:02:45.166 --> 01:02:48.044
or had a heart attack,
something like that.

01:02:48.126 --> 01:02:50.639
I want to be able to go
to the funeral,

01:02:50.725 --> 01:02:52.795
give my condolences
to Roy.

01:02:52.885 --> 01:02:54.443
Cry like
an old grandmother

01:02:54.525 --> 01:02:56.004
and not have my conscience
bother me.

01:02:56.085 --> 01:02:57.484
You get
what I'm saying.

01:02:57.565 --> 01:02:58.964
Yeah, I got it.

01:02:59.045 --> 01:03:00.842
I'll give you
40 grand.

01:03:00.925 --> 01:03:02.880
And if there's no suspicion at all,

01:03:02.964 --> 01:03:05.080
and I mean at all,

01:03:05.164 --> 01:03:07.519
I'll throw in another ten
as a holiday bonus.

01:03:09.964 --> 01:03:12.842
You can finish
jerking off.

01:03:16.803 --> 01:03:18.521
Cheer up, Polack.

01:03:18.603 --> 01:03:20.355
You look like you
don't want to be here.

01:03:20.443 --> 01:03:22.399
If I didn't have to leave the house,
I wouldn't.

01:03:23.803 --> 01:03:26.192
You sure Leo said 40?
Yeah.

01:03:26.283 --> 01:03:29.672
With an extra ten if it looks like
natural causes.

01:03:29.762 --> 01:03:31.275
We use cyanide?
Yeah.

01:03:31.362 --> 01:03:33.557
Use those new spray
bottles I got.

01:03:33.642 --> 01:03:37.112
Sneeze on him, one spray, tss,
he's done. Don't miss.

01:03:39.362 --> 01:03:41.397
Hitting Roy's man could
complicate things for us.

01:03:41.481 --> 01:03:44.951
Well, at the price
Leo's willing to pay,

01:03:45.041 --> 01:03:46.440
this will be it.

01:03:46.521 --> 01:03:48.671
So how's
Atlantic City looking?

01:03:48.761 --> 01:03:52.231
Eh, I should have bought
in before gambling went legal.

01:03:52.361 --> 01:03:53.714
Richard Kuklinski,
a landlord.

01:03:55.160 --> 01:03:57.276
Shit, I give
you two months.

01:03:57.360 --> 01:03:59.715
You're going to be bored
out of your fucking tree.

01:03:59.800 --> 01:04:02.553
More likely they'll find a couple
tenants under the boardwalk.

01:04:07.679 --> 01:04:10.637
Think people are looking
at you, just act gay.

01:04:10.719 --> 01:04:12.437
You know, swishy.

01:05:34.473 --> 01:05:36.828
Polack, what the fuck
are you doing here?

01:05:36.913 --> 01:05:38.232
Where are you going?
Where are you going?

01:05:44.152 --> 01:05:47.303
Baby. Baby, you okay?
What happened?

01:05:47.432 --> 01:05:50.708
Somebody call an ambulance!
Are you sick?

01:05:55.431 --> 01:05:57.581
Hey, you fuck...

01:05:57.671 --> 01:06:00.310
Yo, Ritchie! Ritchie!

01:06:02.351 --> 01:06:04.706
Yo, Ritchie!

01:06:04.791 --> 01:06:06.018
Ritchie!

01:06:06.150 --> 01:06:07.708
I'll meet you
in the car.

01:06:07.790 --> 01:06:09.303
Hey!

01:06:09.390 --> 01:06:10.789
Yo, we was just
talking about you.

01:06:10.870 --> 01:06:12.542
Yeah?

01:06:12.630 --> 01:06:15.906
Motherfucker,
look at you, big guy.

01:06:15.990 --> 01:06:18.026
How you doing, Terry?

01:06:18.110 --> 01:06:19.861
What the hell
happened in there?

01:06:19.949 --> 01:06:21.940
I don't know, looked
like a heart attack to me.

01:06:22.029 --> 01:06:23.860
Ah!
How you doing, Adele?

01:06:23.949 --> 01:06:25.507
I'm good.
How you doing, Ritchie?

01:06:25.629 --> 01:06:27.187
Not bad.
Staying fit.

01:06:27.269 --> 01:06:29.066
Give us a second, babe?
I'm freezing here.

01:06:29.149 --> 01:06:31.708
Just hang,
just one minute, okay?

01:06:31.788 --> 01:06:33.585
Okay.

01:06:33.668 --> 01:06:35.818
Dino tells me you've been
working in Brooklyn.

01:06:35.908 --> 01:06:37.899
Says you're the first Polack
that's going to be made.

01:06:37.988 --> 01:06:40.707
I don't know
what you're talking about.

01:06:40.788 --> 01:06:43.825
He said you got on
with Roy Demeo's crew.

01:06:43.908 --> 01:06:45.306
What can I do
for you, Terry?

01:06:45.387 --> 01:06:49.699
I could use some work.

01:06:49.787 --> 01:06:52.745
I'm married,
I got two kids now.

01:06:54.907 --> 01:06:57.023
Well, I'll see what I can do.
Okay?

01:06:57.107 --> 01:06:58.664
Good to see you.

01:06:58.746 --> 01:07:00.577
Take care, Adele.
Good to see you, Ritchie.

01:07:00.666 --> 01:07:02.065
Come on with the fucking guy.

01:07:04.506 --> 01:07:07.976
Roses are red, violets...

01:07:09.626 --> 01:07:11.502
My Anabel...

01:07:13.065 --> 01:07:15.215
is golden...

01:07:17.385 --> 01:07:18.977
as the light of the moon.

01:07:21.225 --> 01:07:25.263
My Anabel is golden...

01:07:25.344 --> 01:07:29.098
as the light of the moon.

01:07:29.184 --> 01:07:30.981
Nice.

01:07:32.784 --> 01:07:34.820
Nice.

01:07:34.944 --> 01:07:38.094
You just take the can,
you drain it and you just dump it.

01:07:38.183 --> 01:07:40.981
Yeah, I am excited.
Gosh, oh my gosh, I'm 16!

01:07:41.063 --> 01:07:44.135
Or what? Nobody's
even eating any of this.

01:07:44.223 --> 01:07:45.781
I don't like it.

01:07:45.863 --> 01:07:47.535
Hi.

01:07:47.663 --> 01:07:50.097
How you doing, baby?

01:07:50.182 --> 01:07:52.650
That looks nice, honey.
Excuse me, Ritchie.

01:07:52.742 --> 01:07:54.812
That's what I really
want for my birthday.

01:08:05.021 --> 01:08:06.249
What are you doing?

01:08:06.341 --> 01:08:07.774
Got a speech. I love it.

01:08:07.861 --> 01:08:11.092
Yeah. Yeah.

01:08:11.181 --> 01:08:14.491
Okay.

01:08:14.581 --> 01:08:17.697
Roses are red,
violets are blue.

01:08:17.779 --> 01:08:22.058
My Anabel is as golden
as the light of the moon.

01:08:22.140 --> 01:08:23.255
Salud!

01:08:23.340 --> 01:08:24.455
I'm not finished.

01:08:27.460 --> 01:08:31.657
Today is her birthday,
a blessing for all.

01:08:31.738 --> 01:08:35.287
Let's wish her a good one,
and have us a ball.

01:08:37.339 --> 01:08:41.298
That's beautiful!
Happy birthday!

01:08:41.419 --> 01:08:43.055
Thank you.
Oh, baby, I love you so much.

01:08:43.138 --> 01:08:45.732
He wrote the same poem
for my sweet sixteen.

01:08:45.818 --> 01:08:47.649
Oh, really?
Happy birthday.

01:08:47.738 --> 01:08:49.330
Thank you.
You look great.

01:08:49.417 --> 01:08:50.817
Hey, baby.
Thank you so much.

01:08:50.898 --> 01:08:53.093
I didn't know
you had it in you.

01:08:53.178 --> 01:08:54.531
Happy birthday!

01:08:54.618 --> 01:08:56.209
Who wants cake?
I want some cake.

01:08:56.296 --> 01:08:58.015
I got
the knife over here.

01:08:58.096 --> 01:08:59.894
Happy sweet 16th...

01:09:01.457 --> 01:09:02.526
Aw, thank you.

01:09:07.577 --> 01:09:09.770
Hey, Ritchie.
What the fuck are you doing here?

01:09:09.856 --> 01:09:12.654
Roy wants to see you.
I don't give a shit. Get lost.

01:09:12.736 --> 01:09:14.727
Happy birthday.

01:09:14.816 --> 01:09:18.013
Thank you. Oh my gosh.
Look at this!

01:09:42.174 --> 01:09:44.529
All right, Roy, do you mind
moving down the block?

01:09:44.613 --> 01:09:48.526
My daughter's birthday's
going on in there.

01:09:48.613 --> 01:09:54.210
Roy, I have guests.
My whole family is there.

01:09:54.292 --> 01:09:57.971
Maybe I should go in and say
happy birthday to her.

01:10:00.653 --> 01:10:02.290
You're doing hits
with Freezy

01:10:02.412 --> 01:10:05.210
for Leo Marks
behind my back?

01:10:05.332 --> 01:10:07.721
After what I've been
through with Rosenthal?

01:10:07.812 --> 01:10:11.600
Now you're going to send me
to another fucking funeral?

01:10:11.692 --> 01:10:13.762
I don't know what you're
talking about.

01:10:13.852 --> 01:10:17.207
Don't fucking lie to me.
Who do you think you're talking to?

01:10:17.291 --> 01:10:19.122
You fucking lie to me.

01:10:22.571 --> 01:10:24.402
Maybe we'll talk
to your friend Terry,

01:10:24.491 --> 01:10:27.243
seems to think that
you and I are friends.

01:10:29.170 --> 01:10:31.730
I can't imagine what
you've been telling them.

01:10:34.050 --> 01:10:38.202
Poor sons of bitches, thinking
their dad's a decent guy.

01:10:40.250 --> 01:10:42.444
What are you
going to tell your wife

01:10:42.529 --> 01:10:47.683
when I fucking blow your kids'
heads off?

01:10:47.769 --> 01:10:51.808
You think you got
something good?

01:10:51.889 --> 01:10:55.847
Man becomes so full of it,
he forgets what's true.

01:10:55.928 --> 01:10:56.917
Roy.

01:11:01.248 --> 01:11:03.557
Jimmy, get her the fuck
out of here, now.

01:11:06.048 --> 01:11:07.765
Go back inside.

01:11:07.887 --> 01:11:09.718
Don't let him touch her.
Don't let him touch her.

01:11:09.847 --> 01:11:10.916
Daddy?

01:11:12.607 --> 01:11:13.756
Daddy?

01:11:16.167 --> 01:11:17.520
What's going on?

01:11:17.647 --> 01:11:19.603
All right, Jimmy,
wait a minute.

01:11:23.046 --> 01:11:26.038
You best be looking over
your shoulder

01:11:26.126 --> 01:11:27.878
'cause if we cross
paths again,

01:11:27.966 --> 01:11:30.799
I'm going to bury your whole
fucking family.

01:11:30.886 --> 01:11:34.798
Now get out of my
fucking car, Polack.

01:11:41.525 --> 01:11:45.040
Hey, baby.
It's okay.

01:11:45.125 --> 01:11:46.034
Who are they?

01:11:46.124 --> 01:11:47.193
Oh, nobody.

01:11:48.964 --> 01:11:51.000
Nobody you
need to worry about.

01:11:58.324 --> 01:12:00.837
Relax. Everything's okay.
I'll be in in a second.

01:12:04.123 --> 01:12:06.159
It's fine.
You're fine.

01:12:11.043 --> 01:12:12.441
Everything okay, Ritchie?

01:12:12.522 --> 01:12:16.197
What the fuck
did you tell Terry?

01:12:21.802 --> 01:12:24.032
What the...
I don't know.

01:12:24.122 --> 01:12:25.793
You should probably
go talk to him.

01:12:28.041 --> 01:12:30.077
What happened?
Eh, eh...

01:12:30.161 --> 01:12:31.833
It's a misunderstanding.

01:12:31.921 --> 01:12:34.389
It's Anabel's birthday,
Ritchie.

01:12:34.481 --> 01:12:36.312
I got in a deal
with the wrong guys.

01:12:36.401 --> 01:12:38.675
They want the interest paid
before I sell the currency.

01:12:38.760 --> 01:12:40.432
And they came here
to collect?

01:12:40.520 --> 01:12:42.272
They're not
from the bank.

01:12:42.360 --> 01:12:44.316
You are full
of shit, Ritchie.

01:12:44.400 --> 01:12:47.790
Yeah... yeah.

01:12:47.880 --> 01:12:50.519
All right, I'm going back down.
You should come.

01:12:52.639 --> 01:12:55.392
Dad? What is going on?
It's okay, honey.

01:12:55.479 --> 01:12:56.912
Are you coming back
to the party?

01:12:56.999 --> 01:12:59.354
I'll be down
in a second, sweetie.

01:12:59.439 --> 01:13:00.667
Fuck!

01:13:19.477 --> 01:13:23.595
Yeah, I got this guy
in Connecticut, Sam Gunderson.

01:13:23.677 --> 01:13:26.271
He fences
Corvettes to Kuwait.

01:13:26.357 --> 01:13:29.747
For every one you bring him, he'll give
you 40 percent on the window price.

01:13:29.837 --> 01:13:31.986
What's the game plan?

01:13:32.076 --> 01:13:33.668
You just scout the dealership,
pretend you want to buy.

01:13:33.756 --> 01:13:35.986
T ake a test drive,
and you get a key made.

01:13:36.076 --> 01:13:39.307
Come back later and
take it off the lot.

01:13:42.436 --> 01:13:44.232
Just like that?

01:13:44.315 --> 01:13:45.873
What about you?

01:13:45.955 --> 01:13:48.310
What about me?
I was just thinking.

01:13:48.395 --> 01:13:50.147
I got nothing
to do with it.

01:13:50.235 --> 01:13:51.907
You asked me to hook
you up with a job, I did.

01:13:51.995 --> 01:13:55.431
Thank you, Ritchie.
Thank you.

01:13:55.515 --> 01:13:58.108
There's a York Motel
in Jersey City.

01:13:58.194 --> 01:14:00.947
Tomorrow night I'll introduce
you to Sale.

01:14:01.034 --> 01:14:05.630
Okay. Uh, I forgot
to tell you.

01:14:05.714 --> 01:14:10.833
I met your friend
Roy Demeo at Yawns.

01:14:10.913 --> 01:14:13.473
Yeah, I heard
about that.

01:14:13.553 --> 01:14:15.908
He pretended
he didn't know you.

01:14:15.993 --> 01:14:19.542
That's okay.

01:14:19.633 --> 01:14:21.908
I'll see you
tomorrow, Terry.

01:14:21.993 --> 01:14:23.903
Thanks again.
Thanks again.

01:14:43.231 --> 01:14:45.222
You want to be
my friend, Terry?

01:14:48.311 --> 01:14:50.266
Then you keep
your fucking mouth shut.

01:14:53.550 --> 01:14:55.984
Oh! Oh! Oh my.

01:14:56.070 --> 01:14:57.788
What did Santa get me?

01:14:58.870 --> 01:15:02.828
Oh.

01:15:04.309 --> 01:15:07.301
Oh, oh, my...
Let me see.

01:15:07.389 --> 01:15:10.142
You like it?
Oh...

01:15:10.229 --> 01:15:11.742
Mm, I love you.

01:15:11.829 --> 01:15:13.421
I love you.
Look at this.

01:15:13.509 --> 01:15:15.227
Um, Dad.

01:15:15.308 --> 01:15:19.665
Can you believe this.
I can't believe I got it.

01:15:19.788 --> 01:15:21.983
I have got
to try this on.

01:15:22.068 --> 01:15:26.027
Mom, is it okay if I
go over to Amanda's?

01:15:26.108 --> 01:15:28.416
It's Christmas Day.

01:15:28.547 --> 01:15:32.062
I know, I know, but I just, I want to
give her a present before she leaves.

01:15:32.147 --> 01:15:35.423
An hour, tops.
Okay, okay.

01:15:35.507 --> 01:15:37.338
All right, look at how it...

01:15:37.427 --> 01:15:39.099
Oh, my gosh.

01:15:39.187 --> 01:15:42.223
This is, this is...
So pretty.

01:15:42.306 --> 01:15:45.298
Honey,
I can't get the clasp.

01:15:45.386 --> 01:15:47.775
Damn.

01:15:47.866 --> 01:15:50.061
Where are you going?
I'll be right back.

01:15:50.146 --> 01:15:52.740
On Christmas Day? Honey.

01:15:52.826 --> 01:15:55.976
Yeah, yeah. I know, Deb.
I'll be right back.

01:15:56.065 --> 01:15:57.737
Leo's fucking paranoid.

01:15:57.865 --> 01:15:59.662
He thinks Roy knows
he ordered the hit.

01:15:59.745 --> 01:16:01.975
So now he's only offering
ten Gs. You there?

01:16:02.065 --> 01:16:03.180
Yeah.

01:16:04.985 --> 01:16:07.101
Yeah, it's been three months
already. Come on.

01:16:07.185 --> 01:16:09.015
Listen, we'll take
the ten grand.

01:16:09.104 --> 01:16:10.457
It's generous
considering the circumstances.

01:16:10.584 --> 01:16:12.654
Atlantic City can wait.
No.

01:16:12.744 --> 01:16:15.497
This is it.
This money, this job.

01:16:15.584 --> 01:16:18.144
No, we'll wait for this to settle,
and put the word out.

01:16:18.224 --> 01:16:20.783
Two or three more jobs,
you can put a down payment on Steel Pier.

01:16:20.863 --> 01:16:22.296
Where is he
going to be at?

01:16:22.383 --> 01:16:24.851
Dad?
It's a cemetery in Bergen.

01:16:24.943 --> 01:16:26.581
Dad?
Hey! Fuck.

01:16:26.663 --> 01:16:28.540
Hello?
Yes, yes, I'm here.

01:16:28.623 --> 01:16:30.375
Leo Marks is not man we can fuck with.
Do you hear me?

01:16:30.463 --> 01:16:32.454
Dad, it's not working.

01:16:32.543 --> 01:16:35.852
I said I'm on the fucking
phone! Polack. Hello?

01:17:11.580 --> 01:17:14.377
We did him
in a crowded club.

01:17:14.459 --> 01:17:18.896
That's a risk
I don't normally take.

01:17:18.979 --> 01:17:21.209
Forty plus ten
was the deal.

01:17:21.299 --> 01:17:26.214
You've ruined my fucking Christmas.
You're lucky you get away with ten.

01:17:26.298 --> 01:17:28.493
You promised fifty.

01:17:28.578 --> 01:17:30.057
And Chamberlain
promised peace.

01:17:31.538 --> 01:17:33.688
You know who that is?

01:17:36.218 --> 01:17:40.176
I agreed to meet with you because I was
told you were going to give a discount.

01:17:40.257 --> 01:17:42.851
Three months.

01:17:42.937 --> 01:17:46.486
You keep me waiting
three months.

01:17:46.577 --> 01:17:48.056
Fifty is a discount.

01:17:48.137 --> 01:17:50.970
Fifty is a fuck you.

01:17:51.057 --> 01:17:54.093
You and Freezy better
get your story straight.

01:17:54.176 --> 01:17:57.486
Leo, I just
want to go home.

01:17:57.576 --> 01:17:59.965
I just want my money.

01:18:00.056 --> 01:18:01.648
Hm.

01:18:05.256 --> 01:18:07.928
You got
some pair of balls.

01:18:08.015 --> 01:18:10.768
You fuck up a job and now
you want your money.

01:18:10.855 --> 01:18:13.847
No, now that Roy
knows I hired you,

01:18:13.935 --> 01:18:15.573
you get nothing.

01:18:15.655 --> 01:18:17.088
Give me the money, Leo.

01:18:20.414 --> 01:18:22.644
Get the fuck
out of my car, Polack.

01:18:22.734 --> 01:18:24.133
Yeah!

01:18:24.214 --> 01:18:26.330
Hey, don't you
fucking do that.

01:18:26.414 --> 01:18:29.326
You don't fucking do that.
You're a dead man.

01:18:33.653 --> 01:18:36.087
Look, you're good
at what you do. Okay?

01:18:36.173 --> 01:18:39.449
Don't fuck it up any more
than you already have.

01:18:39.533 --> 01:18:41.489
Now just get out of here.
Go.

01:18:44.972 --> 01:18:47.361
Go home to your family.

01:18:47.452 --> 01:18:52.162
Life can be
very random sometimes.

01:18:52.252 --> 01:18:54.891
Yeah. You're right.

01:19:03.931 --> 01:19:05.046
What the fuck?

01:19:14.530 --> 01:19:16.122
Goddamn it!

01:19:16.210 --> 01:19:19.361
You fuck! You fuck!

01:20:07.766 --> 01:20:11.441
Hello?
Betsy? You paged me?

01:20:11.526 --> 01:20:13.801
Yes, Daddy.

01:20:13.886 --> 01:20:16.116
There was an accident.
It's Anabel. She's in the hospital.

01:20:16.206 --> 01:20:17.354
What happened, honey?

01:20:17.445 --> 01:20:19.083
It was a hit and run.

01:20:19.165 --> 01:20:20.644
We're at
Glen Heights Hospital.

01:20:20.725 --> 01:20:22.078
Come on.

01:20:22.165 --> 01:20:23.678
Come now, please!

01:20:33.844 --> 01:20:36.153
Honey.
Hey.

01:20:36.244 --> 01:20:38.553
Hey, sweetie.
Come here.

01:20:38.644 --> 01:20:44.439
Come here, sweetie.
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

01:20:45.003 --> 01:20:50.236
Hey. That's my...

01:20:50.323 --> 01:20:53.759
I'm going to go in, okay.
Okay.

01:20:53.843 --> 01:20:55.515
Just sit down.
Sit down.

01:21:01.202 --> 01:21:04.877
This is
the end of it.

01:21:04.962 --> 01:21:08.159
There ain't going to be nothing
else to be afraid of.

01:21:08.242 --> 01:21:10.118
I promise.

01:21:10.201 --> 01:21:13.477
I didn't know I was
supposed to be afraid.

01:21:18.081 --> 01:21:21.710
What did the cops say?
Uh, they say a hit and run, no witnesses?

01:21:21.801 --> 01:21:23.438
Did they get a make
and model on the car?

01:21:23.560 --> 01:21:25.232
I don't know.
Well, didn't you talk to them?

01:21:25.320 --> 01:21:27.914
This was done
on purpose.

01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:29.638
They were just waiting
for her, Ritchie.

01:21:29.720 --> 01:21:31.711
Three blocks
from our house.

01:21:34.240 --> 01:21:36.036
No, don't you
touch her.

01:21:42.039 --> 01:21:43.631
I'm going to find out
who did this.

01:21:43.719 --> 01:21:45.072
Yeah, you better.

01:21:51.438 --> 01:21:53.076
Oh, my God.

01:22:00.158 --> 01:22:05.993
I'm sorry. I'm sorry!
I'm sorry!

01:22:06.077 --> 01:22:11.754
Sorry! I'm sorry!

01:22:43.634 --> 01:22:46.785
You're looking a little pale, Polack.
How are you?

01:22:46.874 --> 01:22:49.468
I'm not sure.
Why are you all cleaned up?

01:22:49.554 --> 01:22:51.988
Yeah, well,
let me give you a clue.

01:22:52.074 --> 01:22:56.271
We both should
be scared shitless.

01:22:56.353 --> 01:22:58.548
Well, they're not looking
for an ice cream truck.

01:22:58.633 --> 01:23:00.305
I know, they're looking
for the Iceman.

01:23:00.393 --> 01:23:02.304
Lucky son
of a bitch.

01:23:02.393 --> 01:23:05.226
I ought to charge you royalties
for headlines like that.

01:23:09.992 --> 01:23:13.029
That was your friend, right?
Guy outside the club?

01:23:13.112 --> 01:23:15.103
Yeah, but he's
not my friend.

01:23:15.192 --> 01:23:17.069
No shit.

01:23:17.152 --> 01:23:19.268
Listen, it's only
a matter of time now.

01:23:19.352 --> 01:23:22.309
Roy knows he's a dead man unless
you come forward on Leo Marks.

01:23:22.391 --> 01:23:26.862
He's got to prove
you pulled the trigger.

01:23:26.951 --> 01:23:30.421
My wife.
Our kids.

01:23:30.511 --> 01:23:32.263
They're all fucking
threats now.

01:23:32.351 --> 01:23:33.703
Doesn't matter
if they love you

01:23:33.790 --> 01:23:35.667
if they think
you're a murderer.

01:23:35.750 --> 01:23:38.025
Maybe there's a way we
can do each other a favor.

01:23:38.110 --> 01:23:39.099
What?

01:23:44.030 --> 01:23:46.179
Kill my family.

01:23:46.269 --> 01:23:49.545
You kill mine,
I'll kill yours.

01:23:49.629 --> 01:23:51.904
I know where you live.
I wouldn't even wake you up.

01:23:57.309 --> 01:23:59.868
Listen, the way
I see it, it's a lose lose.

01:23:59.948 --> 01:24:02.223
Either we get pinched,
or Roy finds us.

01:24:02.308 --> 01:24:05.505
Either way, we go away
and everybody suffers.

01:24:05.588 --> 01:24:07.499
How do you know?
What?

01:24:09.828 --> 01:24:12.625
How do you know
where I live?

01:24:12.707 --> 01:24:14.618
Course I know where you live.
You mentioned it.

01:24:16.747 --> 01:24:20.057
Nah. I never
told you that.

01:24:22.467 --> 01:24:24.298
Fuck!

01:24:24.387 --> 01:24:25.899
What the fuck
is wrong with you?

01:24:29.066 --> 01:24:30.943
Get your hand out
of your pocket.

01:24:31.026 --> 01:24:32.664
I'm getting
a fucking tissue.

01:24:32.746 --> 01:24:33.895
Relax!

01:24:36.546 --> 01:24:39.662
Fuck! Jesus Christ!

01:24:39.745 --> 01:24:41.622
You know, considering
your nerves

01:24:41.705 --> 01:24:45.095
maybe we should renegotiate
our little partnership, pal.

01:24:45.225 --> 01:24:49.377
Can I blow my nose now?
Jesus Christ.

01:25:23.342 --> 01:25:25.617
What's up, Ritchie?

01:25:25.702 --> 01:25:29.615
Shit. Hey.
I'm fucking exhausted.

01:25:33.221 --> 01:25:34.973
How do you know
this guy?

01:25:35.061 --> 01:25:36.460
He used to work with me.
Yeah?

01:25:36.541 --> 01:25:38.691
Chopping twenties
at the store.

01:25:38.781 --> 01:25:41.534
Sister used to work for a chemist,
so he's probably your best bet.

01:25:41.621 --> 01:25:42.974
You trust him?

01:25:43.061 --> 01:25:46.018
Do I trust him?
Yeah, I guess.

01:25:46.100 --> 01:25:48.978
It's not my usual thing,
but he gets whatever I need.

01:25:49.060 --> 01:25:50.812
I know him
from Brooklyn.

01:25:50.900 --> 01:25:54.529
Dominick Provenzano?
Yeah.

01:25:54.620 --> 01:25:58.214
I'll give him a shot.
I got to kill this cocksucker.

01:25:58.299 --> 01:26:00.813
Ritchie, you don't hurt a guy
like Roy Demeo

01:26:00.899 --> 01:26:02.730
without something happening to you,
you know?

01:26:02.819 --> 01:26:04.810
Yeah, that's why I need it.
There can't be a trace.

01:26:04.939 --> 01:26:07.214
He's coming after my family.
How do you know it's him?

01:26:07.299 --> 01:26:10.017
Because, he said he was going
to come after my family.

01:26:10.138 --> 01:26:11.696
Then get the fuck
out of town.

01:26:11.778 --> 01:26:13.450
Take Deb and the kids
and get out of here.

01:26:13.538 --> 01:26:15.051
Do you need money
or something? Nah.

01:26:15.138 --> 01:26:17.971
Nah, I got to take
care of this first.

01:26:18.098 --> 01:26:21.215
Did you hear about Terry?
Yeah. It's sad.

01:26:21.298 --> 01:26:25.370
It's fucking crazy.
They're calling him the Iceman.

01:26:25.457 --> 01:26:27.687
Terry tells me he's got
something with some guy.

01:26:27.777 --> 01:26:29.688
Next thing you know,
he's fucking dead.

01:26:29.777 --> 01:26:31.927
Found him on the side of the
highway in a garbage bag.

01:26:32.017 --> 01:26:33.973
Fucking crazy killer fucking
freezes his bodies

01:26:34.057 --> 01:26:38.334
so the cops won't know
the fucking time of death.

01:26:38.456 --> 01:26:41.493
I mean, do you believe this shit?

01:26:41.576 --> 01:26:42.565
What guy?

01:26:42.656 --> 01:26:44.647
What do you mean?

01:26:44.736 --> 01:26:46.567
Who was Terry
going to meet?

01:26:46.656 --> 01:26:48.772
I don't know.
He never told me.

01:26:48.856 --> 01:26:50.288
The police
talk to you?

01:26:50.375 --> 01:26:51.854
Yeah, twice.
But what do I know?

01:26:54.455 --> 01:26:57.731
Dino, thanks for coming,
all right?

01:26:57.815 --> 01:27:01.524
Hey.
Of course, Ritchie.

01:27:01.615 --> 01:27:02.729
Let's go see the girls,
huh?

01:27:02.854 --> 01:27:03.889
Yeah.

01:27:19.453 --> 01:27:21.409
How you doing?
Dominick.

01:27:21.493 --> 01:27:24.087
Yeah. Wow,
you're a big guy.

01:27:24.173 --> 01:27:26.368
A lot bigger than you
sound on the phone.

01:27:26.453 --> 01:27:27.806
Hey, you know
what they say.

01:27:27.893 --> 01:27:29.211
No, I have no idea.

01:27:29.292 --> 01:27:30.486
That's just what
they say.

01:27:35.252 --> 01:27:38.210
So...
One sec.

01:27:38.292 --> 01:27:40.248
Look, I'll be honest
with you, you know?

01:27:40.332 --> 01:27:41.844
I like Dino,
but, you know,

01:27:41.971 --> 01:27:43.882
sometimes he's
so full of it

01:27:43.971 --> 01:27:45.962
you never really know who
his friends are. You know?

01:27:46.051 --> 01:27:48.884
Oh, yeah. Yeah.
So, look, you know.

01:27:48.971 --> 01:27:52.122
I, I don't really understand this
whole cyanide thing, you know?

01:27:52.211 --> 01:27:56.806
I'm curious, you know,
how's this thing work?

01:27:56.890 --> 01:27:58.960
You put the stuff in a mist.

01:27:59.050 --> 01:28:03.089
You spray it in someone's face,
they fall asleep.

01:28:03.170 --> 01:28:08.402
I tell you, you know, it could
take some time to get that shit.

01:28:08.489 --> 01:28:09.922
How long
are we talking?

01:28:10.009 --> 01:28:11.886
Well, it might take
a week or two.

01:28:11.969 --> 01:28:13.641
That's too long.

01:28:13.729 --> 01:28:17.005
Oh, I mean, I can tell you
wanna, you know.

01:28:17.129 --> 01:28:18.562
I'm going to need
some cash then.

01:28:18.649 --> 01:28:21.082
Not until delivery.

01:28:21.168 --> 01:28:25.958
Well...
it wouldn't have to be.

01:28:26.048 --> 01:28:30.485
Tell you what.
I got this trust fund kid, okay?

01:28:30.568 --> 01:28:33.241
I've been supplying him with
coke for about couple years now.

01:28:33.328 --> 01:28:35.318
He wants me to get him two Ks.

01:28:35.407 --> 01:28:39.446
All this cyanide talk and everything,
it's got me thinking.

01:28:39.567 --> 01:28:42.525
Thinking what?

01:28:42.607 --> 01:28:45.917
We could kill two birds
here with one stone.

01:28:46.007 --> 01:28:47.917
Well, that's always
a good idea.

01:28:48.006 --> 01:28:50.122
Kill two birds
with one stone.

01:28:50.206 --> 01:28:53.915
Hey, you know, I could...
I could take care of the cyanide

01:28:54.006 --> 01:28:58.443
but, I'm going to need you
to take care of the kid.

01:29:00.685 --> 01:29:02.994
Why?

01:29:03.085 --> 01:29:04.996
He's a fucking
degenerate.

01:29:05.085 --> 01:29:07.360
He's got markers all over the
fucking place, you know?

01:29:07.445 --> 01:29:12.200
Besides, he holds a grudge. He's
liable to blackmail me and bail him out.

01:29:12.285 --> 01:29:14.161
You do me this favor

01:29:14.244 --> 01:29:16.997
and I'll split you with his
payment 50-50, okay?

01:29:17.084 --> 01:29:19.803
We'll keep the coke
and the cash.

01:29:19.884 --> 01:29:21.875
Deal is worth
60 grand, easy.

01:29:21.964 --> 01:29:24.637
And I'll have that shit to you
by next week. No problem.

01:29:24.724 --> 01:29:27.157
Who you work for?

01:29:27.243 --> 01:29:29.154
I work with Luchezi family.
You know?

01:29:29.243 --> 01:29:31.040
But I got to keep that
low key, you know?

01:29:31.123 --> 01:29:33.557
They want a piece of every
fucking thing that I got.

01:29:33.643 --> 01:29:34.996
Don't worry.

01:29:35.083 --> 01:29:36.801
I'm Polish.
I work for everybody.

01:29:39.003 --> 01:29:41.562
That's good to hear.

01:29:41.642 --> 01:29:44.839
He likes the offer, but he's
still looking for 315.

01:29:44.962 --> 01:29:49.035
And he'll get it, too,
with property that close to Atlantic City.

01:29:49.122 --> 01:29:53.319
315, huh? What's the down
payment on that?

01:29:53.401 --> 01:29:55.278
We could have gone
at 15 percent,

01:29:55.361 --> 01:29:56.874
but because it's all cash,
it's 40 grand.

01:29:56.961 --> 01:30:00.715
40. Okay.

01:30:04.841 --> 01:30:06.558
Tell them I'm in.

01:30:06.640 --> 01:30:08.551
I'll have the balance
in the next couple days.

01:30:08.640 --> 01:30:09.789
You sure?

01:30:09.880 --> 01:30:11.791
Yeah, I'm working on it.

01:30:11.880 --> 01:30:14.314
It's as sound as it gets,
Mr. Kuklinski.

01:30:14.400 --> 01:30:16.231
There's no reason
the building

01:30:16.320 --> 01:30:18.231
won't be filled by the
end of the year.

01:30:18.320 --> 01:30:20.275
Can you come by tomorrow
to finish the paperwork?

01:30:20.359 --> 01:30:22.270
Yeah, I'll call you
to schedule tomorrow.

01:30:22.359 --> 01:30:24.589
I hope you're
as excited as I am.

01:30:24.679 --> 01:30:26.397
Yeah, I am.

01:30:26.479 --> 01:30:29.073
Great!
Take care, Mr. Kuklinski.

01:30:29.159 --> 01:30:30.148
Thanks.

01:30:39.158 --> 01:30:40.796
How are you feeling?

01:30:40.878 --> 01:30:41.947
Agh.

01:30:49.757 --> 01:30:51.076
You still got
a fever.

01:30:51.157 --> 01:30:53.717
Mm.

01:30:53.797 --> 01:30:57.426
I left Anabel...
physical therapy at 4:00.

01:30:57.517 --> 01:30:59.268
Yeah, I'll take her.

01:30:59.356 --> 01:31:01.233
Oh, it's just the flu, Ritchie.
I can do it.

01:31:01.316 --> 01:31:05.070
Uh-uh. Let the doctor
tell me that.

01:31:11.995 --> 01:31:13.872
I'll make you
an appointment, okay?

01:31:13.955 --> 01:31:15.513
Okay.

01:31:33.794 --> 01:31:35.466
Hey, how you doing,
big guy?

01:31:35.554 --> 01:31:37.589
Show me
what you got.

01:31:37.673 --> 01:31:41.985
Please, I had a half a dozen
waivers to forge for that shit.

01:31:42.073 --> 01:31:44.587
It's 11:00 now.
See you back here at 1:30.

01:31:44.673 --> 01:31:46.789
What time did you
tell the kid?

01:31:46.873 --> 01:31:50.183
2:00. Hey, you going to put the,
uh, cyanide in the coke, right?

01:31:50.273 --> 01:31:51.785
No, I'm going
to make sandwiches.

01:31:51.912 --> 01:31:55.507
It's lunchtime.
We'll eat, too. Okay?

01:32:31.309 --> 01:32:32.264
Here you go
come on.

01:32:32.349 --> 01:32:33.577
Here, kitty.

01:32:37.269 --> 01:32:39.658
Here you go.
Yeah, good, huh?

01:33:01.347 --> 01:33:04.737
Okay. All right.
There you go.

01:33:26.185 --> 01:33:29.063
Something's not right.

01:33:29.145 --> 01:33:30.373
Honey?

01:33:31.745 --> 01:33:33.019
Nothing.

01:33:50.703 --> 01:33:52.022
Oh, my God!

01:33:53.863 --> 01:33:55.091
Ritchie!

01:33:56.183 --> 01:33:57.377
Ritchie!

01:34:02.022 --> 01:34:03.580
Oh, my God!

01:34:03.662 --> 01:34:06.096
Get out of the car,
Mr. Kuklinski!

01:34:06.182 --> 01:34:07.376
Get out of the vehicle!

01:34:07.462 --> 01:34:09.612
Ritchie?
Don't move.

01:34:09.742 --> 01:34:11.937
Get the fuck out of the car now!
Keep your hands up!

01:34:12.022 --> 01:34:15.900
Get out of the fucking car now!
Put your hands up!

01:34:15.981 --> 01:34:17.858
Put your hands
on the wheel!

01:34:17.941 --> 01:34:19.420
Open the door!

01:34:19.501 --> 01:34:22.061
Get the fuck
out of the car now!

01:34:22.141 --> 01:34:24.974
It's locked.
Get out of the car now!

01:34:25.061 --> 01:34:26.653
Break it!

01:34:26.741 --> 01:34:28.571
Put your hands somewhere
I can see them!

01:34:28.660 --> 01:34:30.969
No! No! Don't!

01:34:31.100 --> 01:34:32.249
Don't you touch him!

01:34:32.340 --> 01:34:33.773
Get out of the car!

01:34:33.860 --> 01:34:36.738
Come here!
Don't you touch my...

01:34:36.820 --> 01:34:38.538
Ritchie!

01:34:38.620 --> 01:34:40.611
You leave her alone!

01:34:40.699 --> 01:34:42.576
You fucking sons
of a bitches!

01:34:42.699 --> 01:34:46.328
I'll fucking kill every last one of you!
Ritchie!

01:34:46.419 --> 01:34:48.694
Throw him
down right now.

01:34:48.779 --> 01:34:50.849
Come on, in.

01:34:50.939 --> 01:34:54.294
Get him down!

01:34:54.378 --> 01:34:56.255
Put him down!
No!

01:34:56.338 --> 01:34:57.930
Get him down!
No!

01:34:58.018 --> 01:35:00.054
Take him down.

01:35:07.082 --> 01:35:08.052
Ritchie!

01:35:08.659 --> 01:35:09.853
Ritchie!

01:35:10.897 --> 01:35:12.455
Hold him down!
Hold him down!

01:35:12.537 --> 01:35:14.175
You've got the right
to remain silent.

01:35:14.257 --> 01:35:16.532
Anything you say or do
can and will be...

01:35:16.617 --> 01:35:19.256
All these fucking guys
for one little guy!

01:35:19.337 --> 01:35:22.373
Huh? You think
you're fucking tough?

01:35:22.456 --> 01:35:24.606
Come on, you piece of shit.

01:35:30.336 --> 01:35:34.248
Get him in!
Come on, get in!

01:35:34.335 --> 01:35:35.324
Close the door!

01:35:46.494 --> 01:35:49.088
Great job.

01:35:49.214 --> 01:35:51.284
Hey, Dominick!

01:35:51.374 --> 01:35:53.842
Good job.

01:35:53.934 --> 01:35:55.526
Yeah!

01:35:55.614 --> 01:35:56.649
Yeah.

01:36:00.573 --> 01:36:01.642
You recognize that guy?

01:36:06.213 --> 01:36:08.408
Ritchie.

01:36:08.493 --> 01:36:10.245
Rich!
Rich!

01:36:31.091 --> 01:36:33.764
Law enforcement authorities
have arrested

01:36:33.851 --> 01:36:35.489
one of the most notorious

01:36:35.571 --> 01:36:37.721
contract killers
in state history.

01:36:37.811 --> 01:36:40.722
A self-employed Bergen County
man is behind bars.

01:36:40.810 --> 01:36:45.247
He is such a cold-blooded killer,
they call him The Iceman.

01:36:45.330 --> 01:36:47.969
Mr. Kuklinski,
please rise.

01:36:55.849 --> 01:36:58.807
I never felt sorry
for anything I done...

01:37:00.529 --> 01:37:02.326
other than hurting
my family.

01:37:07.568 --> 01:37:10.480
The only thing
I feel sorry for.

01:37:15.008 --> 01:37:17.238
I'm not looking
for forgiveness.

01:37:19.247 --> 01:37:20.521
I'm not repenting.

01:37:25.927 --> 01:37:27.679
I know I'm wrong.

01:37:31.286 --> 01:37:32.514
I'm wrong.

01:37:38.006 --> 01:37:41.999
I do want my family
to forgive me.

01:37:44.045 --> 01:37:47.117
Oh, boy.

01:37:50.165 --> 01:37:52.599
Ain't going to make
this one.

01:38:00.244 --> 01:38:01.563
Holy shit.

01:38:08.604 --> 01:38:10.673
This would never be me.

01:38:13.923 --> 01:38:17.552
This would not be me.

01:38:22.323 --> 01:38:24.517
You see the Iceman crying?

01:38:26.762 --> 01:38:28.275
Not very macho.

01:38:36.681 --> 01:38:38.319
But I hurt people...

01:38:41.241 --> 01:38:43.596
that mean
everything to me.

01:38:49.680 --> 01:38:55.152
But the only people that
mean anything to me.

01:39:52.876 --> 01:39:56.948
# Walk on down the road #

01:39:57.035 --> 01:40:02.746
# Two separate lives #

01:40:02.835 --> 01:40:06.874
# One not more
than the other #

01:40:06.995 --> 01:40:11.863
# Unbalanced my mind #

01:40:13.554 --> 01:40:16.785
# Forget regret #

01:40:16.874 --> 01:40:22.823
# There's no looking back #

01:40:22.913 --> 01:40:26.223
# Sometimes I wish
I was another #

01:40:26.313 --> 01:40:29.988
# But there's no looking back #

01:40:33.433 --> 01:40:36.504
# Don't stand
never change it #

01:40:36.592 --> 01:40:39.743
# Steady to middle #

01:40:42.912 --> 01:40:46.791
# Black and white
Two straight lines #

01:40:46.872 --> 01:40:50.386
# To the bitter end #

01:40:57.871 --> 01:41:01.465
# Oooh #

01:41:01.550 --> 01:41:03.298
# Ooh ooh #

01:41:03.802 --> 01:41:05.687
# Ooh ooh #

01:41:18.669 --> 01:41:22.378
# No one sees pain #

01:41:22.469 --> 01:41:24.585
# It's not on display #

01:41:28.388 --> 01:41:32.427
# Deep into my silence #

01:41:32.508 --> 01:41:34.385
# You fade into gray #

01:41:38.948 --> 01:41:42.144
# Where did I get off #

01:41:42.227 --> 01:41:45.617
# And who's got my back #

01:41:48.827 --> 01:41:51.785
# Since I'm doing shows
and other #

01:41:51.867 --> 01:41:54.175
# But there's no looking back #

01:41:59.026 --> 01:42:02.416
# Constant never changing #

01:42:02.506 --> 01:42:08.102
# Steady to middle #

01:42:08.185 --> 01:42:12.337
# Black and white
Two straight lines #

01:42:12.425 --> 01:42:13.778
# To the bitter end #

01:42:23.880 --> 01:42:27.668
# Oooh #

01:42:27.760 --> 01:42:29.512
# Ooh ooh #

01:42:32.120 --> 01:42:35.317
# Ooh ooh #

01:42:38.920 --> 01:42:42.037
# Ooh ooh #
