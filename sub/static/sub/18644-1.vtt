20:19.178 --> 20:23.599
<i>On the first wave,
I dropped into it and
it literally broke.</i>

20:23.807 --> 20:26.643
I was like, "Is this...
Is this really even happening?"

20:26.852 --> 20:28.979
- On a wave.
- On a wave like this?

20:29.188 --> 20:31.315
It can only get better
from there.

[Ian] <i>I wasn't really here
on the buoys this morning,</i>

26:55.699 --> 26:58.994
so we slowed everything down
rather than launching at
like, six o'clock,

26:59.202 --> 27:02.789
we decided to just move
everything back

27:02.998 --> 27:07.502
<i>and not burn ourselves out
sitting out there,
waiting for the waves.</i>

27:07.711 --> 27:11.715
The winds are gonna come up,
but there's no wind right now,
so the quicker we get out there

27:11.923 --> 27:13.174
the glassier it'll be.

[Shane] <i>First thing that you
really feel is the texture

<i>Then you see if it's windy
or if it's choppy.</i>

27:39.826 --> 27:43.455
<i>There's a lot of refraction
coming off the rocks.</i>

27:43.663 --> 27:46.541
<i>You feel the energy
of the swell,</i>

27:46.750 --> 27:49.753

everything sets in for the day.

27:49.961 --> 27:51.713

Ian's dropping.

27:52.922 --> 27:54.132
[upbeat music playing]

28:04.225 --> 28:05.268
That was a stiff one.

28:05.477 --> 28:06.936
Got really steep.

28:16.946 --> 28:18.531
Keep an eye,
here comes the set.

28:30.418 --> 28:32.379
Grab the rope.
Grab the rope.

28:32.587 --> 28:33.505
Good?

28:36.132 --> 28:37.384
All right. This is Greg.

28:42.472 --> 28:44.015
This is Ian. This is Ian
Ian is up. Ian is up.

28:59.280 --> 29:01.574
[Ian] I think I've
cut myself pretty bad.

29:01.783 --> 29:04.160
We're getting back to the boat.
Ian cut his finger.

29:04.369 --> 29:06.121
Get the boat ready.

29:06.329 --> 29:07.580
- Can I surf still, you think?
- Yes.

29:08.540 --> 29:10.291
Just wrap it. Stitch it later.

29:10.500 --> 29:12.335
[Ian] <i>Had a little hiccup
in the middle of the day.</i>

29:12.544 --> 29:15.588
<i>The back of the fins
sliced my finger open</i>

29:15.797 --> 29:17.340
<i>pretty much down
to the bone.</i>

29:17.549 --> 29:19.551
<i>Wrapped it up real quick
and went back out,</i>

29:19.759 --> 29:24.389
<i>and I got another fun wave
that was really bumpy.</i>

29:24.597 --> 29:29.060
<i>Ended up taking a breather
and the waves just seemed to
get kinda weird right then.</i>

29:33.732 --> 29:36.609
That little bit of wind makes
night and day difference.

29:36.818 --> 29:39.654
Not seeing anything and having
<i>salt water in your eyes...</i>

29:42.532 --> 29:46.453
<i>you're basically jumping off
a bridge without knowing
what's at the bottom of it.</i>

29:50.498 --> 29:54.252
[Grant] <i>On a really good day
at Jaws, you could go and
just catch one wave</i>

29:54.461 --> 29:56.588
in those seven, eight,
nine hours.

29:59.382 --> 30:01.509
[Ian] <i>Kinda just finally got
the whole crew in,</i>

30:01.718 --> 30:03.720
<i>and I'll go get stitched up
this evening,</i>

30:03.928 --> 30:08.224
make sure I didn't chop
any tendons or anything weird.

30:08.433 --> 30:12.103
<i>I think it was a medium
to average day,
but very good start.</i>

30:13.104 --> 30:14.481
It's just the beginning.

30:16.900 --> 30:19.360
[man] <i>Push out. Good.
Close in.</i>

30:19.569 --> 30:20.528
Out.

30:20.737 --> 30:22.697
Good. Now put your hand
down completely.

30:22.906 --> 30:25.033
If there's a contest,
an epic swell,

30:25.241 --> 30:27.410
you need to surf tomorrow,
I could dress it properly.

30:27.619 --> 30:30.038
It's probably better you stay
out of the water for
a couple of days.

30:30.246 --> 30:32.290
Yeah, I'm aiming for the 10th.

30:32.499 --> 30:35.251
- Okay.
- So six days would be my goal.

30:40.423 --> 30:43.635
[Shane] <i>The whole history
of big wave surfing
is super interesting.</i>

30:43.843 --> 30:45.678
You know, those guys
are like, such pioneers.

30:45.887 --> 30:49.307
<i>They'd go out there with
no leashes
and no safety equipment.</i>

30:49.516 --> 30:54.187
[Greg] <i>There was always
this idea that anything
bigger than 40 feet</i>

30:54.395 --> 30:56.940
starts to become too dangerous
to paddle, you know,

30:57.148 --> 30:59.234
that borderline
impossible size.

30:59.442 --> 31:02.904
And then there was this
sort of introduction
of tow surfing.

31:03.112 --> 31:07.242
Basically, if you could stand
<i>up on a surf board, you would
get towed into a big wave.</i>

31:07.450 --> 31:10.620
You can ride 10 or 15
of those types of waves

31:10.829 --> 31:13.873
<i>because of how much more
you can position yourself.</i>

31:14.082 --> 31:16.417
[Greg] <i>Got a machine that can
go 40 miles an hour,</i>

31:16.626 --> 31:19.462
and if the wave is 50 feet
that direction, go get it.

31:22.131 --> 31:25.677
[man] <i>Guys wouldn't surf
all year, then they would
come out and tow 50 feet.</i>

31:25.885 --> 31:27.178
<i>It's insane.</i>

31:28.847 --> 31:31.891
You take any average person
to paddle surf out at Jaws,

31:32.100 --> 31:35.895
they're not gonna catch a wave,
<i>and if they do, they're gonna
get absolutely annihilated.</i>

31:46.656 --> 31:51.911
What the tow revolution did,
was show us that it was
possible to survive

31:52.120 --> 31:54.455
<i>waves a lot bigger
than we imagined.</i>

32:01.087 --> 32:06.092
[man] <i>Tow surfing just really
helped develop the jet ski
as a tool for water safety</i>

32:06.301 --> 32:09.846
<i>and anything you're gonna
do in the ocean.</i>

32:10.054 --> 32:16.853
[Chris] <i>That was really
the stepping stone for the next
evolution of big wave surfing.</i>

32:17.061 --> 32:19.731
<i>I used to race competitively
with paddle boards,</i>

32:19.939 --> 32:25.278
and had this idea I could
just really make these boards
paddle faster.

32:25.486 --> 32:29.991
<i>That's when Ian, and Greg,
and a handful of other guys</i>

32:30.199 --> 32:31.910
started paddling these things.

32:33.995 --> 32:37.332
[Grant] <i>We made that
conscious decision to
stop tow surfing</i>

32:37.540 --> 32:38.917
<i>and go back to paddling.</i>

32:44.631 --> 32:47.675
[Matt] <i>All the speed that
the wave travels once
it gets over 50 feet</i>

32:47.884 --> 32:51.679
is too fast for your
average board design.
Everything has to change.

32:52.931 --> 32:54.515
<i>Are they ready?
I'm not sure.</i>

32:54.724 --> 32:57.435
No one's ever done this before,
<i>so nobody knows.</i>

32:59.187 --> 33:02.440
[man] <i>Chris Christenson,
he keeps details</i>

33:02.649 --> 33:06.152
<i>that I don't think any other
shaper really does.</i>

33:06.361 --> 33:09.864
So I think finding something
that we can hold a higher line

33:10.073 --> 33:11.658
and whenever I get
really pounded,

33:11.866 --> 33:14.410
it's 'cause I'm drifting
a little bit too far
down the wave.

33:14.619 --> 33:16.496
[Chris] <i>After every
major swell he surfs,</i>

33:16.704 --> 33:18.748
<i>we get in touch with
each other right after it.</i>

33:18.957 --> 33:22.877
Having that more parallel rail
up here will allow the board
to work better in the pocket,

33:23.086 --> 33:26.172
we're able to get you
to paddle in faster
with the wider shoulders

33:26.381 --> 33:29.467
and then having that
wider tailbox is what's allowing
you to be a little looser.

33:32.762 --> 33:36.015
[Chris] <i>If they can be
confident in me before
they get into the water,</i>

33:36.224 --> 33:38.518
<i>that's, right away, they're
ahead of the game.</i>

33:50.196 --> 33:52.365
[man] <i>The forecast is
looking really good,</i>

33:52.573 --> 33:54.117
probably the best of the year.
