WEBVTT

00:02.090 --> 00:03.490
I'm so glad we could
finally do this.

00:03.491 --> 00:05.559
I know, Kylie says you're
always stuck at the precinct.

00:05.560 --> 00:08.296
- Yeah.
- [Phone rings]

00:08.297 --> 00:09.795
Speaking of,
this is work.

00:09.796 --> 00:11.529
Sorry.

00:11.530 --> 00:12.730
What's up, Peralta?

00:12.731 --> 00:14.431
Captain called.
He needs everybody back.

00:14.432 --> 00:16.397
There's a lead on
the nightingale strangler.

00:16.398 --> 00:19.799
We're looking for a white male,
5'10", medium build,

00:19.800 --> 00:23.000
brown hair, small scar
on his right cheek.

00:23.034 --> 00:24.467
Okay.

00:24.468 --> 00:27.867
His M.O. is he finds
lonely women with no friends,

00:27.868 --> 00:29.335
poisons their food,

00:29.336 --> 00:30.936
and then guts 'em
in his van.

00:30.937 --> 00:32.572
It's pretty gnarly.

00:32.573 --> 00:35.707
Last seen wearing
a salmon shirt, grey blazer,

00:35.708 --> 00:37.342
and witnesses have said

00:37.343 --> 00:39.610
he has trouble
fitting lettuce in his mouth.

00:39.644 --> 00:41.910
Okay.
Where are you?

00:41.911 --> 00:43.478
Apparently has the world's
smallest penis

00:43.479 --> 00:44.545
and doesn't know
how to use it...

00:44.546 --> 00:46.013
Hi, there,
I'm Jake Peralta,

00:46.014 --> 00:47.713
Amy's boss.
That's not true.

00:47.714 --> 00:48.747
What are you
doing here?

00:48.748 --> 00:50.315
I'm here
on a date.

00:50.316 --> 00:52.115
Who is
now leaving.

00:52.116 --> 00:54.350
Worth it.
Have a great night.

00:54.351 --> 00:56.351
- Your boss seems really nice.
- He's not my boss.

00:56.352 --> 00:57.351
Yes, I am!

five felonies in a week?

01:27.072 --> 01:28.072

Five felonies

That's the sweet taste

- You should shower more.
- Yep.

01:41.114 --> 01:43.520
Updates on open cases.

01:43.547 --> 01:45.014
I just got a DOA
on Bessimer street.

01:45.048 --> 01:47.049
You're the primary,
you're in charge.

01:47.050 --> 01:48.283
Take Diaz and Peralta.

01:48.318 --> 01:49.418
Yes.

01:49.419 --> 01:51.987
My fantasy threesome.

01:51.988 --> 01:53.422
Of cops on a case.

01:53.456 --> 01:55.057
Detectives, our monthly crime
statistics are due.

01:55.091 --> 01:57.660
I want all paperwork on
your closed cases by tomorrow.

01:57.661 --> 01:58.927
Scully, you can just write

01:58.928 --> 02:00.295
"I didn't close any"
on a piece of paper.

02:00.330 --> 02:01.363
You got it.

02:01.397 --> 02:02.797
I already got my paperwork in,
Captain.

02:02.831 --> 02:05.366
Then I guess this little
reminder isn't for you.

02:05.400 --> 02:08.235
Wow, looks like he hates you
even more than me.

02:08.269 --> 02:09.536
No, he doesn't.

02:09.537 --> 02:10.770
We have a good relationship.

02:10.771 --> 02:12.072
We're on the same page.

02:12.106 --> 02:14.274
Something to share with the rest
of us, Santiago?

02:14.275 --> 02:17.777
No, sir, I wasn't... Peralta was
the one that was talking.

02:17.778 --> 02:20.446
God, you must have been
the worst fourth grader ever.

02:20.480 --> 02:21.480
Joke's on you.

02:21.481 --> 02:22.976
I skipped fourth grade.

02:22.983 --> 02:24.283
Santiago, anything else?

02:24.317 --> 02:25.718
No.
No?

02:25.719 --> 02:27.319
Uh-uh.

02:27.320 --> 02:28.320
(Holt)
Dismissed.

02:28.321 --> 02:30.622
Hey, Boyle. I know you haven't
had Peralta

02:30.623 --> 02:31.790
as a secondary
in a while.

02:31.791 --> 02:32.791
Be careful.

02:32.792 --> 02:33.925
It can be rough.

02:33.960 --> 02:36.194
Hey, saboteur,
that's not true.

02:36.195 --> 02:39.197
I happen to be
a very good secondary.

02:39.231 --> 02:41.699
So you were just
borrowing those cars?

02:41.700 --> 02:44.335
(Peralta)
Ask about his bank account.

02:44.370 --> 02:45.470
Ask about his bank account!

02:45.504 --> 02:48.339
Ask him about
his bank...

02:48.340 --> 02:49.973
Account.

02:49.974 --> 02:51.407
You should ask him
about his bank account.

02:51.408 --> 02:54.610
Captain,
Santiago broke the glass.

02:54.611 --> 02:56.045
You can't
give up control,

02:56.046 --> 02:58.013
you're terrible at taking
your primary's orders,

02:58.014 --> 03:00.015
you just do
whatever you want.

03:00.016 --> 03:01.550
I could go
on and on and on.

03:01.584 --> 03:03.551
Is something no lover
of yours has ever said.

03:03.586 --> 03:04.853
Blammo.

03:04.854 --> 03:06.855
Look, I can be
an amazing secondary

03:06.856 --> 03:07.856
and I'll prove it.

03:07.857 --> 03:09.024
I know you will,
Jake-in-the-box.

03:09.025 --> 03:10.492
Okay, don't ever
call me that again.

03:10.493 --> 03:11.827
I'm driving.
We should leave now.

03:11.828 --> 03:13.629
Carry my bag.

03:13.663 --> 03:17.266
But you should pick the music,
primary.

03:17.300 --> 03:21.303

03:32.648 --> 03:33.681
I hate it.

03:33.682 --> 03:38.219
Me too.

03:38.220 --> 03:40.287
So I have an eyewitness in
the purse-snatcher case.

03:40.288 --> 03:42.689
Only problem is,
the sketch artist is out sick.

03:42.690 --> 03:44.023
How do you want me
to proceed?

03:44.024 --> 03:46.092
Figure it out, Santiago.
It's your case.

03:46.126 --> 03:48.427
Yes.
I will do that.

03:48.462 --> 03:50.162
Thank you.

03:50.163 --> 03:51.664
Are you bowing?

03:51.698 --> 03:54.066
No.

03:54.067 --> 03:57.070
This is how I walk.

03:59.407 --> 04:00.941
What do you need,
Quasimodo?

04:00.942 --> 04:02.242
I gotta go meet
with Boyle and Peralta.

04:02.276 --> 04:03.977
Is there something wrong
with the Captain?

04:03.978 --> 04:05.411
It seems like
he's in a bad mood.

04:05.446 --> 04:08.080
I don't know.
Who can tell?

04:08.115 --> 04:10.216
You all right,
Captain?

04:10.250 --> 04:11.250
Tough weekend?

04:11.251 --> 04:13.953
I went to Barbados
with my husband.

04:13.954 --> 04:16.454
We wove hats
out of Palm fronds

04:16.456 --> 04:18.156
and swam with
the stingrays.

04:18.158 --> 04:22.060
I've never been happier.

04:22.060 --> 04:24.463
Guy's impossible to read.
Don't even try.

04:24.497 --> 04:25.998
(Holt)
That is, without question,

04:25.999 --> 04:27.767
the funniest story
I've ever heard.

04:31.238 --> 04:32.738
Wow.

04:32.772 --> 04:34.733
This guy must have
weighed 500 pounds.

04:34.740 --> 04:36.140
I think we have an idea
what killed him.

04:36.141 --> 04:38.375
Spoiler alert:
It was not starvation.

04:38.409 --> 04:40.042
Both: What do we got?

04:40.043 --> 04:41.509
Sorry,
sorry.

04:41.510 --> 04:44.011
You're the primary,
you're in charge.

04:44.045 --> 04:45.345
Frank Patterson.

04:45.346 --> 04:47.914
58 years old, married,
no children.

04:47.915 --> 04:49.882
Wife found him this morning
and called it in.

04:49.883 --> 04:52.518
Any signs of forced entry
or a struggle?

04:52.552 --> 04:53.552
No.

04:53.553 --> 04:54.552
You sure about that?

04:54.553 --> 04:55.753
Looks like maybe his belt

04:55.754 --> 04:57.474
had a pretty epic struggle
with his stomach.

04:57.489 --> 04:58.554
[Laughs]

04:58.589 --> 04:59.622
What are you thinking,
Boyle?

04:59.656 --> 05:01.623
All ri...
I'm calling natural causes.

05:01.624 --> 05:03.091
We got heart medicine over here,

05:03.092 --> 05:04.758
home defibrillator.

05:04.759 --> 05:06.326
And a frequent customer
gift basket

05:06.327 --> 05:08.162
from the cardiac wing
of Brooklyn Methodist.

05:08.196 --> 05:09.563
This case is open
and shut.

05:09.564 --> 05:12.400
Just like his mouth was,
constantly.

05:12.401 --> 05:13.968
That was
my last fat joke.

05:13.969 --> 05:15.203
Okay?

05:15.204 --> 05:16.237
Diaz, check and see
if there's

05:16.238 --> 05:17.371
any more meds
in the bathroom.

05:17.372 --> 05:18.706
Boyle, see what
you can find in the bedroom.

05:18.707 --> 05:21.676
I'll take the kitchen.

05:21.710 --> 05:24.045
Yep, that's exactly
what I was gonna say.

05:24.046 --> 05:25.079
It's... it's so weird.

05:25.080 --> 05:26.180
He's so good at knowing

05:26.181 --> 05:27.315
what I'm gonna
tell him to do,

05:27.316 --> 05:31.486
he just does it.
It's weird.

05:32.821 --> 05:34.088
Hey, sergeant.

05:34.089 --> 05:36.090
You know how
you're really good at doodling?

05:36.124 --> 05:38.292
I know you think
you're complimenting me,

05:38.293 --> 05:40.661
but calling them doodles
is an insult.

05:40.696 --> 05:43.064
You a big fan
of Picasso's doodles?

05:43.098 --> 05:44.832
Sorry.

05:44.833 --> 05:46.200
Can you please
draw a perp for me?

05:46.201 --> 05:47.402
The sketch artist
is out sick

05:47.403 --> 05:49.037
and the Captain
wants this done right away.

05:49.038 --> 05:50.172
He's in a bad mood.

05:50.173 --> 05:51.206
Is he?

05:51.207 --> 05:53.508
I can never read him.

05:53.509 --> 05:55.043
You look chipper, Captain.

05:55.044 --> 05:56.043
You have a fun weekend?

05:56.078 --> 05:58.112
There was a small fire
in my home.

05:58.113 --> 06:02.153
I lost many photo albums
of treasured memories.

06:02.184 --> 06:03.685
I'm devastated.

06:03.686 --> 06:05.219
I'm telling you,

06:05.220 --> 06:06.387
he and I have a connection

06:06.388 --> 06:07.922
and there is something
bothering him.

06:07.923 --> 06:09.890
Can you help me out?

06:09.891 --> 06:11.625
Great.

06:11.660 --> 06:13.127
Ma'am, can you please
describe the perp

06:13.128 --> 06:14.395
to sergeant Jeffords?

06:14.396 --> 06:16.831
Yeah, he had,
um, dark, curly hair,

06:16.832 --> 06:18.132
and a neck tattoo...

06:18.133 --> 06:19.400
Wait, wait, wait.
Slow down.

06:19.434 --> 06:21.803
Let's start with the eyes.

06:21.804 --> 06:24.338
Were they desperate?
Lonely?

06:24.339 --> 06:25.473
Did they betray heartache?

06:25.507 --> 06:26.974
They were brown.

06:27.008 --> 06:30.010
Do you even
want your purse back?

06:31.980 --> 06:34.148
So far you've managed
to tell three fat jokes

06:34.149 --> 06:35.649
and completely
bulldoze Charles.

06:35.650 --> 06:37.284
Is that your idea
of being a good secondary?

06:37.318 --> 06:39.286
First off,
I've told four.

06:39.287 --> 06:40.921
And second,
I'm helping.

06:40.922 --> 06:43.123
I mean, I started cataloguing
the contents of the fridge,

06:43.124 --> 06:44.658
but it turns out there's not
enough paper on earth.

06:44.659 --> 06:46.360
Five fat jokes.

06:46.361 --> 06:47.395
- Thanks, Arnie.
- [Laughs]

06:47.396 --> 06:48.564
See, Arnie thinks
I'm doing great.

06:48.598 --> 06:49.665
Arnie, shut up.

06:49.666 --> 06:52.734
Jake, for once,
just hang back

06:52.735 --> 06:54.670
and let Boyle do his job.

06:54.704 --> 06:56.338
[Groans]
Fine.

06:56.339 --> 06:58.741
Unless I get a direct order
from Boyle

06:58.742 --> 07:00.509
I will stand
here motionless

07:00.510 --> 07:03.646
like a wise,
old oak tree.

07:03.680 --> 07:06.315
You look like an idiot.

07:06.316 --> 07:09.084
I'm so sorry for your loss,
Mrs. Patterson.

07:09.085 --> 07:11.353
Can you talk about
what happened after breakfast?

07:11.354 --> 07:12.654
I took the dog
for a walk.

07:12.655 --> 07:14.389
When I came back,
he was dead.

07:14.423 --> 07:15.935
I'm just in shock.

07:15.959 --> 07:18.194
We were going on a cruise
together next week.

07:18.195 --> 07:21.066
He had pre-purchased
the unlimited soda package.

07:21.098 --> 07:23.499
I'm sure the soft drink industry
mourns his passing.

07:27.337 --> 07:31.807
Motion reactivated.

07:31.842 --> 07:33.376
Hey.

07:33.410 --> 07:34.610
Detective Jake Peralta.

07:34.645 --> 07:36.713
Dr. Rossi.
I'm the new medical examiner.

07:36.714 --> 07:37.781
Don't let me
get in your way.

07:37.782 --> 07:38.942
I'm sure
you have a lot to do.

07:38.949 --> 07:40.617
Actually, I've been given
a direct order

07:40.618 --> 07:42.552
to do nothing, so.

07:42.553 --> 07:44.321
What brings you here...

07:44.322 --> 07:46.823
Okay.
All right.

07:46.824 --> 07:48.391
Sorry.
Sorry.

07:48.426 --> 07:52.429
- You all right?
- What's up?

07:55.433 --> 07:57.102
How's the Patterson case
looking?

07:57.135 --> 07:58.702
It looks like
natural causes,

07:58.703 --> 07:59.903
but I'll know for sure
once I get

07:59.904 --> 08:01.305
the autopsy results
tomorrow.

08:01.306 --> 08:03.807
Jake volunteered to follow up
with the M.E.

08:03.808 --> 08:05.376
My man is all over it.

08:05.410 --> 08:07.862
I'm really glad you could
sneak away from your case.

08:07.879 --> 08:10.881
Well, it's technically
not really my case,

08:10.915 --> 08:14.518
but on the plus side, I have
all the time in the world.

08:14.552 --> 08:16.086
- Oh.
- To you.

08:16.121 --> 08:18.155
And to the ginormous,
dead fat man

08:18.156 --> 08:19.857
- who brought us together.
- [Laughs]

08:26.820 --> 08:27.987
(Boyle)
Hey, Jake.

08:27.988 --> 08:29.054
Have you heard anything
from the M.E.?

08:29.055 --> 08:30.489
She hasn't sent
the autopsy report.

08:30.524 --> 08:31.924
Oh, that's strange.

08:31.925 --> 08:33.659
Maybe probably
a bunch more people died

08:33.659 --> 08:34.960
and she got super busy?

08:34.961 --> 08:36.028
That's definitely
what happened.

08:36.029 --> 08:38.097
Okay, just let me know
when she calls.

08:38.097 --> 08:39.698
You got it.

08:39.732 --> 08:41.400
[Clears throat]

08:41.400 --> 08:43.068
Hey, can I
ask you guys something?

08:43.102 --> 08:44.102
Can you keep a secret?

08:44.102 --> 08:45.403
Do you know anything
about my life?

08:45.404 --> 08:46.604
No, I do not.
Good point.

08:46.605 --> 08:48.506
Okay, so you know the new
medical examiner?

08:48.507 --> 08:50.575
I kinda had sex
with her last night.

08:50.576 --> 08:52.243
What?

08:52.244 --> 08:54.111
Oh, sorry, I forgot
who I was talking to.

08:54.112 --> 08:56.113
Sex is something that two adults
do with their bodies

08:56.114 --> 08:57.481
when they're attracted
to each other.

08:57.482 --> 08:59.162
He's right, Santiago.
Do you not know that?

08:59.184 --> 09:01.986
I meant,
what were you thinking?

09:01.987 --> 09:03.687
She was supposed
to be doing an autopsy

09:03.688 --> 09:05.456
for your primary, Charles.

09:05.490 --> 09:06.757
The guy died
of natural causes.

09:06.758 --> 09:07.858
What's the big deal?

09:07.859 --> 09:09.226
Anyways,
back to last night.

09:09.227 --> 09:10.828
As you would imagine,
I'm normally up

09:10.829 --> 09:12.463
for pretty much anything
in the bedroom,

09:12.464 --> 09:15.865
but I can't tell if what
happened was weird or sexy.

09:15.899 --> 09:17.934
Wait.
Close your eyes.

09:17.935 --> 09:22.405
Oh, okay.

09:22.406 --> 09:23.406
- [Yelps]
- Shh.

09:23.407 --> 09:26.375
Shh, shh, shh,
shh, shh, shh.

09:26.376 --> 09:27.476
What are you doing?

09:27.511 --> 09:29.812
I like 'em cold.

09:29.813 --> 09:31.214
Okay...

09:31.215 --> 09:32.215
Not that weird.

09:32.216 --> 09:33.716
Cold?
Like a dead guy?

09:33.717 --> 09:34.884
You're reading into that.

09:34.885 --> 09:36.085
Am I?

09:36.086 --> 09:37.987
You have a really nice chest.

09:38.021 --> 09:39.322
Thank you.

09:39.323 --> 09:40.756
I'd love to crack it open

09:40.757 --> 09:43.092
and get my hands
all over your organs.

09:43.093 --> 09:44.527
Okay...

09:44.528 --> 09:45.761
I wonder how much
your appendix weighs.

09:45.796 --> 09:47.730
[Gasps]
Oh.

09:47.765 --> 09:49.065
It's inflamed.

09:49.100 --> 09:50.266
All right.

09:50.267 --> 09:51.401
Wait, that's bad,
right?

09:51.402 --> 09:53.069
- Yeah, it is.
- Oh, no.

09:53.070 --> 09:54.270
Ew!

09:54.271 --> 09:55.805
Please tell me
you ran out of there.

09:55.839 --> 09:57.840
No.

09:57.841 --> 10:00.776
For some reason
I kinda started getting into it.

10:00.811 --> 10:03.146
Oh, what do we have here?

10:03.180 --> 10:06.482
A 34-year-old caucasian male
who is dead.

10:06.483 --> 10:07.483
Very dead.

10:07.484 --> 10:08.551
Mmm.

10:08.552 --> 10:09.686
Cause of death?

10:09.687 --> 10:12.588
Initial assessment:
Blunt force trauma.

10:12.589 --> 10:15.058
But what do I find when I probe
a little farther?

10:15.059 --> 10:16.559
Bruising around the neck.

10:16.560 --> 10:19.062
And ocean water
in the lungs.

10:19.063 --> 10:21.431
Ooh, how long
have you been dead, body?

10:21.432 --> 10:22.498
Four days.

10:22.499 --> 10:24.067
Gross.
Bloating. Odors.

10:24.068 --> 10:26.503
Oh, uh, 24 hours.

10:26.504 --> 10:28.538
Perfect.

10:28.539 --> 10:30.306
Here we go.

10:30.307 --> 10:32.775
Stop, stop, stop!
Weird, weird, weird!

10:32.776 --> 10:34.610
Rosa, what's your call?
Weird or sexy?

10:34.644 --> 10:35.644
Weird.

10:35.645 --> 10:36.878
I knew it.

10:36.879 --> 10:39.181
- But also kinda sexy?
- No. Weird.

10:39.182 --> 10:40.816
But more importantly,
that's what you were doing

10:40.817 --> 10:42.217
while Charles was grinding
through paperwork?

10:42.251 --> 10:43.719
Told ya.

10:43.720 --> 10:44.886
Worst secondary
in the unit.

10:44.921 --> 10:46.455
What do you guys
want from me?

10:46.456 --> 10:48.356
You know, I take over a crime
scene, I'm a bad secondary.

10:48.357 --> 10:50.159
I blow off work to have sex
with a hot coroner,

10:50.160 --> 10:51.326
I'm a bad secondary.

10:51.327 --> 10:52.327
I can't win.

10:52.328 --> 10:53.328
What are you guys
talking about?

10:53.329 --> 10:54.730
Um, just weird
sex stuff

10:54.731 --> 10:55.964
that has nothing
to do with work.

10:55.965 --> 10:58.032
I once had sex
on a futon.

10:58.033 --> 11:01.268
And it was in couch mode.

11:01.269 --> 11:03.270
Hmm.

11:06.474 --> 11:08.342
Sarge, all of these
are fine.

11:08.343 --> 11:09.643
How much longer are you
gonna work on this?

11:09.644 --> 11:11.212
It's questions like that

11:11.213 --> 11:13.180
that made Van Gogh
cut off his ear.

11:13.181 --> 11:16.117
You can't put a clock
on art.

11:16.151 --> 11:17.619
Ten minutes.

11:17.620 --> 11:18.620
Great.

11:18.621 --> 11:19.654
Let's catch this guy

11:19.655 --> 11:20.888
so we can give Holt
some good news.

11:20.889 --> 11:22.056
I wanna cheer him up.

11:22.057 --> 11:23.591
Well, how do you
even know he's in a bad mood?

11:23.625 --> 11:25.860
I mean, it's impossible
to read that guy.

11:25.861 --> 11:28.529
This is the most incompetent,
worthless report

11:28.530 --> 11:30.464
I have ever read
in my life!

11:30.499 --> 11:32.934
Get your act together
or, so help me God,

11:32.935 --> 11:35.536
you won't live
to see retirement!

11:35.537 --> 11:37.738
It's like,
"what's that guy thinking?"

11:37.739 --> 11:38.739
You know?

11:38.740 --> 11:40.141
I can read him.

11:40.142 --> 11:41.208
And if anyone
can figure out

11:41.209 --> 11:43.144
what's bothering him,
it's me.

11:43.145 --> 11:45.079
He and I
are exactly the same.

11:45.080 --> 11:47.348
Except that I'm younger,
Cuban,

11:47.349 --> 11:48.716
female, single,
and straight.

11:48.717 --> 11:51.319
Captain Holt's
not gay.

11:51.353 --> 11:52.353
Captain Holt's gay?

11:52.354 --> 11:55.357
Seriously, man,
just retire.

11:57.026 --> 11:59.260
Boyle, where's my paperwork
on that DOA?

11:59.295 --> 12:00.628
Still waiting on
the autopsy report.

12:00.629 --> 12:01.897
Supposed to come in
first thing this morning,

12:01.898 --> 12:04.299
- but so far, nothing.
- This is unacceptable.

12:04.300 --> 12:06.201
I'll call the M.E.
and find out what happened.

12:06.202 --> 12:08.704
Eh, bup-bup-bup-bup-bah.

12:08.738 --> 12:10.405
That's not necessary, sir.

12:10.406 --> 12:12.841
For the record, I think it's
natural causes anyway,

12:12.842 --> 12:14.843
but I'm also
the secondary in this case.

12:14.877 --> 12:17.111
It's my responsibility,
so I will head on down there

12:17.112 --> 12:18.112
and pick up the report.

12:18.113 --> 12:19.314
Good.

12:19.315 --> 12:20.815
But don't ever
bup-bup-bup-bup me again.

12:20.816 --> 12:21.816
Right,
I don't know...

12:21.851 --> 12:24.185
Bup-bup-bup-bup...
Bup-bup-bup.

12:24.186 --> 12:25.587
Just go.

12:25.588 --> 12:28.356
Yep, I am going to regret
teaching him that one.

12:30.359 --> 12:31.693
Rosa, can I
show you something?

12:31.694 --> 12:32.928
What's up?

12:32.929 --> 12:34.463
Patterson's wife told me

12:34.464 --> 12:36.565
that they were going
on a cruise together next month,

12:36.566 --> 12:38.933
but her credit card bill shows
only one ticket booked.

12:38.968 --> 12:42.570
Either she's lying
or she knew he was gonna die.

12:42.604 --> 12:44.906
Huh, nice find, Boyle.

12:44.907 --> 12:46.407
This could be a murder.

12:46.408 --> 12:47.742
Where's that autopsy?

12:47.743 --> 12:49.477
Jake went down to the M.E.
an hour and a half ago.

12:49.478 --> 12:50.878
He still hasn't
got back to me.

12:50.913 --> 12:52.413
Jake went to get
the autopsy report?

12:52.414 --> 12:54.816
I know.
Isn't he the best?

12:54.817 --> 12:57.185
I mean, he's really coming into
his own as a secondary.

12:57.219 --> 12:59.121
I wanna get him
something nice.

12:59.122 --> 13:00.889
Does he come across more
as a Pinot guy

13:00.890 --> 13:02.090
or more of a Shiraz?

13:02.124 --> 13:03.291
You know what?

13:03.292 --> 13:04.359
We better go down there.

13:04.360 --> 13:05.694
See what's holding him up.

13:05.695 --> 13:08.163
Good call.

13:10.032 --> 13:11.633
Detectives.
[Clears throat]

13:11.634 --> 13:12.634
Hello.

13:12.635 --> 13:14.002
Shirt's buttoned wrong.

13:14.003 --> 13:16.872
(Dr. Rossi) Huh.
So it is.

13:16.873 --> 13:17.973
Well, how can I help you?

13:17.974 --> 13:19.841
Uh, we came by
to get that autopsy report.

13:19.876 --> 13:21.943
- Hmm.
- Is Detective Peralta here?

13:21.944 --> 13:23.512
I haven't seen him.

13:23.513 --> 13:24.680
Thanks for coming by.

13:24.681 --> 13:25.681
(Peralta)
[Coughing]

13:25.682 --> 13:29.785
Hold on.

13:29.786 --> 13:31.419
Found him.

13:31.420 --> 13:33.621
Ah, thank goodness
you're here.

13:33.622 --> 13:35.857
I am so lost.

13:35.858 --> 13:38.393
Do you know where
the vending machines are?

13:41.474 --> 13:42.474
Look, it's not
what it seems like.

13:42.475 --> 13:43.575
Yes, it is.

13:43.576 --> 13:44.676
Yes, it is.
Here's what happened.

13:44.677 --> 13:46.578
I came down here
to get the autopsy report

13:46.579 --> 13:49.013
and in conclusion,
here we are.

13:49.014 --> 13:50.215
Now if you'll
excuse me...

13:50.249 --> 13:51.483
Cut the crap, Peralta.

13:51.484 --> 13:53.685
Look, I'm sorry I slowed down
the autopsy results,

13:53.686 --> 13:55.386
but everyone knows
it's natural causes.

13:55.421 --> 13:57.188
Not anymore.
We think it could be a murder.

13:57.222 --> 13:58.322
Wait,
like a murder murder,

13:58.323 --> 13:59.724
or, like,
his mouth murdered him

13:59.725 --> 14:00.725
by making him
eat so much food

14:00.726 --> 14:01.726
that his heart exploded?

14:01.727 --> 14:02.727
Murder murder.

14:02.728 --> 14:04.677
We need the autopsy
to be sure.

14:04.696 --> 14:05.897
I have not gotten
to that yet.

14:05.931 --> 14:07.699
You guys have been down here
for two hours.

14:07.700 --> 14:09.968
What, did you
have sex 40 times?

14:10.002 --> 14:11.235
40 times?

14:11.270 --> 14:12.437
No, Charles,
like...

14:12.438 --> 14:13.571
Look, I'm sorry.

14:13.572 --> 14:14.772
We didn't know
it was a homicide.

14:14.806 --> 14:16.007
Well, it shouldn't matter.

14:16.008 --> 14:17.708
I'm your primary
and I asked you to do something.

14:17.709 --> 14:20.277
So if it's okay,
I'd like to be upset with you.

14:20.312 --> 14:21.612
It's more than okay.

14:21.613 --> 14:22.947
It's okay times two.

14:22.981 --> 14:24.548
Now, Dr. Rossi,

14:24.583 --> 14:27.325
will you please perform
the autopsy for us right now?

14:27.352 --> 14:29.019
Actually,
with a body this size,

14:29.020 --> 14:30.187
I'd need my assistant,

14:30.221 --> 14:32.423
and I gave him
the rest of the afternoon off

14:32.424 --> 14:33.424
when Jake showed up.

14:33.425 --> 14:35.374
Guilty.

14:35.393 --> 14:36.994
Okay, fine.

14:36.995 --> 14:39.363
I will act
as your assistant

14:39.364 --> 14:42.065
because I am
a wonderful secondary.

14:42.066 --> 14:43.667
How gross could it be?

14:43.701 --> 14:45.002
Just gonna need you
to hold open

14:45.003 --> 14:46.937
this chest cavity
for me.

14:46.972 --> 14:48.972
Oh.
Wow.

14:48.973 --> 14:51.275
Okay, I can do that.
It's no big deal.

14:51.276 --> 14:53.877
Just like holding open
some slimy elevator doors.

14:53.912 --> 14:56.913
For a family of aliens...
Oh, my God.

14:56.948 --> 15:00.017
Yep, there are some signs
of stress on the heart,

15:00.018 --> 15:01.252
but that's not surprising.

15:01.253 --> 15:03.888
Oh, will you look
at that stomach lining?

15:03.889 --> 15:05.156
God,
that is just a beaut.

15:05.157 --> 15:06.658
Ugh.

15:06.692 --> 15:07.692
All right.

15:07.693 --> 15:08.693
I'm gonna need you
to go ahead

15:08.694 --> 15:09.694
and take your hand...

15:09.695 --> 15:10.695
[Groans]

15:10.696 --> 15:12.163
- Yep, get it down there.
- [Groans]

15:12.164 --> 15:13.231
Get it down there.

15:13.232 --> 15:14.232
Get it on in.

15:14.233 --> 15:15.566
- [Groans]
- There you go.

15:15.567 --> 15:16.701
Oh, that is so big.

15:18.437 --> 15:20.572
- Caught him?
- Yes, sir.

15:20.606 --> 15:21.740
He was easy to pick up.

15:21.741 --> 15:23.809
He looked just like
the sergeant's sketch.

15:23.844 --> 15:25.478
You could be
a professional artist, boss.

15:25.512 --> 15:26.946
Like on the boardwalk.

15:26.980 --> 15:29.515
You think I should
draw caricatures?

15:29.516 --> 15:30.817
That's garbage art!

15:30.818 --> 15:33.186
I don't draw giant-head people
on surfboards!

15:33.220 --> 15:36.088
I'm saying you could.
You're that good.

15:36.122 --> 15:38.257
Captain, the credit really goes
to sergeant Jeffords.

15:38.258 --> 15:40.459
Without his refined
artistic skills...

15:40.493 --> 15:41.826
Finish the paperwork
by noon.

15:41.827 --> 15:45.297
I want it included
in the crime stats.

15:45.331 --> 15:46.898
I gotta say, I always hate
how I look in pictures,

15:46.899 --> 15:48.400
but that is so flattering.

15:48.401 --> 15:49.969
Also, I'm innocent.

15:49.970 --> 15:50.970
You got the wrong guy.

15:50.971 --> 15:52.105
Shut up.

15:52.106 --> 15:54.674
Sarge, I need you to do
one more drawing for me.

15:54.709 --> 15:55.842
What?

16:00.248 --> 16:01.615
It'll cheer the Captain up.

16:01.616 --> 16:03.016
He'll be over the moon.

16:03.017 --> 16:05.018
He may even lean back
in his chair a little

16:05.019 --> 16:06.220
and nod slightly.

16:06.254 --> 16:07.488
This is a lot
of pressure.

16:07.489 --> 16:10.524
If I'm gonna do this,
it has to be done right.

16:10.559 --> 16:14.695
Scully, get me my oils.

16:14.729 --> 16:17.998
Paint or massage?

16:18.032 --> 16:19.665
I'll get both.

16:19.700 --> 16:21.767
You know, this is one
of the most unhealthy people

16:21.768 --> 16:22.834
I've ever seen.

16:22.835 --> 16:23.835
It's like cutting

16:23.836 --> 16:26.637
into a big,
overstuffed ravioli.

16:26.671 --> 16:27.905
Sure you want me
to keep digging?

16:27.939 --> 16:30.140
Unfortunately, yes.

16:30.141 --> 16:32.175
If the primary on this case
says it's a murder,

16:32.176 --> 16:33.409
we have to treat it
like a murder.

16:33.443 --> 16:35.945
Okay.
Here we go.

16:35.946 --> 16:36.946
Oh.

16:36.947 --> 16:37.947
Wanna see
something cool?

16:37.948 --> 16:38.948
No.

16:38.949 --> 16:39.949
Here it is.

16:39.950 --> 16:41.110
That's what
I'm talking about.

16:41.118 --> 16:43.919
[Gasps]
Listen.

16:43.954 --> 16:45.354
Goosh.

16:45.355 --> 16:46.656
Mm-hmm.

16:46.657 --> 16:48.124
You know
what that was?

16:48.125 --> 16:51.962
That was the air releasing from
the large intestine.

16:51.963 --> 16:53.763
[Sighs]
In the biz, we call that

16:53.764 --> 16:55.398
"the death bubble."
It's pretty cool.

16:55.399 --> 16:57.333
- Here, you wanna hold it?
- No!

16:58.802 --> 17:00.103
Knock knock.

17:00.137 --> 17:01.438
You can knock
with your hands.

17:01.439 --> 17:02.705
Saying it
is ridiculous.

17:02.740 --> 17:04.606
Okay.

17:04.607 --> 17:08.509
Well, I know
you're having a bad day...

17:08.542 --> 17:11.277
I think
you're having a bad day.

17:11.278 --> 17:15.880
So, to cheer you up
I had Terry do this painting

17:15.881 --> 17:17.848
to replace
the photo you hated.

17:17.883 --> 17:21.152
I threw away the photo because
I think it's ostentatious

17:21.153 --> 17:22.619
to hang pictures
of yourself.

17:22.621 --> 17:25.390
Especially when you haven't
earned a place on the wall.

17:25.424 --> 17:27.791
- Oh.
- But you would have me

17:27.792 --> 17:29.427
hang a baroque oil painting
of myself

17:29.428 --> 17:31.050
like I'm
a north Korean dictator.

17:31.063 --> 17:33.231
What?
No ornate gold frame?

17:33.232 --> 17:37.068
Why am I not astride
my noble steed, clad in armor?

17:37.102 --> 17:39.704
We could add a horse.

17:39.739 --> 17:41.740
You just wasted your time,
Terry's time,

17:41.741 --> 17:42.941
and now my time on this

17:42.975 --> 17:44.075
when you should
have been filing a report

17:44.076 --> 17:45.210
on the purse-snatcher.

17:45.244 --> 17:46.478
Oh, I did.

17:46.479 --> 17:47.560
It's already in the system.

17:47.580 --> 17:49.047
- Oh.
- Mm-hmm.

17:49.048 --> 17:51.015
Good.

17:51.016 --> 17:54.018
Thank you.
Dismissed.

17:55.787 --> 17:58.122
Here are the contents
of his stomach.

17:58.123 --> 17:59.857
Oh, that's where
they went.

17:59.858 --> 18:01.158
And here's
the really cool part.

18:01.159 --> 18:03.708
Get in here, look at
the scarring on this liver.

18:03.728 --> 18:06.163
Cause of death: Poison.

18:06.164 --> 18:08.232
Ingested.

18:08.233 --> 18:11.803
Boyle was right.

18:11.804 --> 18:13.037
All right,
I'm gonna go tell him.

18:13.038 --> 18:15.373
Yeah, you could.

18:15.407 --> 18:18.309
Or you could
stay for a post-mortem.

18:18.343 --> 18:20.144
Nope.
Sorry.

18:20.145 --> 18:21.279
The spell has worn off.

18:21.313 --> 18:23.481
No more weird dead guy sex
for me ever again.

18:23.515 --> 18:24.548
It's nothing personal,

18:24.549 --> 18:26.817
I just think sex
is for the living.

18:26.851 --> 18:27.851
Isn't that right, buddy?

18:27.852 --> 18:29.286
Oh, my God,
he has no eyes!

18:29.287 --> 18:30.721
Oh, that is terrifying.

18:37.212 --> 18:38.612
What now, Santiago?

18:38.647 --> 18:40.515
I figured out
why you've been so tense.

18:40.549 --> 18:42.783
You're worried about
the monthly crime statistics.

18:42.818 --> 18:45.119
That's not your concern.

18:45.153 --> 18:46.954
I just checked
the stats myself.

18:46.955 --> 18:49.490
Our arrest numbers haven't
improved since you got here.

18:49.491 --> 18:51.226
They're exactly the same
as last month.

18:51.260 --> 18:52.862
If this is your strategy
to cheer me up,

18:52.863 --> 18:53.929
it's backfiring.

18:53.930 --> 18:55.364
Sir, I don't think
you realize

18:55.365 --> 18:57.233
how good flat numbers are.

18:57.234 --> 18:59.068
I went back 12 years.

18:59.069 --> 19:01.104
A precinct's numbers
almost always get worse

19:01.105 --> 19:03.239
under new leadership,
but ours didn't.

19:03.273 --> 19:05.141
That's a win.

19:05.175 --> 19:06.576
It's just your first month.

19:06.610 --> 19:09.244
Morale is much higher,
people are working harder,

19:09.279 --> 19:10.279
you're well on your way

19:10.280 --> 19:11.847
to earning a place
on that wall.

19:11.881 --> 19:15.317
Thank you, Santiago.

19:15.352 --> 19:18.387
You know, we're birds
of a feather, you and I.

19:18.422 --> 19:19.422
I hate cliches.

19:19.456 --> 19:23.826
Cliches are the worst.
Okay.

19:32.803 --> 19:34.236
We know you killed
your husband.

19:34.271 --> 19:36.038
That cruise you planned
was for one,

19:36.039 --> 19:38.274
plus the autopsy showed
clear signs of poison.

19:38.308 --> 19:39.975
And for the record,
the inside of his body

19:39.976 --> 19:41.977
- was very gross.
- Noted.

19:41.978 --> 19:43.913
My only question is,
why'd you do it?

19:43.947 --> 19:46.516
Um, he drove me to it.

19:46.517 --> 19:48.017
He had affair after affair.

19:48.018 --> 19:49.552
He was a real don Juan.

19:49.586 --> 19:51.588
Permission to make a fat joke?
Granted.

19:51.589 --> 19:52.989
Are you sure you didn't mean
"don flan"?

19:53.023 --> 19:54.924
Thanks.
Nice.

19:54.959 --> 19:55.959
Mrs. Patterson,
you are under arrest

19:55.960 --> 19:59.729
for the murder
of your husband.

19:59.764 --> 20:01.598
Sarge, that painting
is tight.

20:01.632 --> 20:02.632
It's terrible.

20:02.633 --> 20:04.367
The brushwork
is sloppy.

20:04.402 --> 20:05.769
There's poor use
of negative space.

20:05.803 --> 20:06.970
I'm a fraud.

20:07.004 --> 20:09.139
Not at all.

20:09.140 --> 20:11.274
I'd like to take this home
for my husband.

20:11.308 --> 20:14.844
He'll be glad
you made me look so happy.

20:14.845 --> 20:16.913
I was trying
to make him look serious.

20:16.914 --> 20:18.081
I still can't read him.

20:18.115 --> 20:20.817
- No one can.
- I can.

20:20.818 --> 20:23.819
He likes it.

20:25.189 --> 20:26.356
- (Diaz)
- Nice job, Boyle.

20:26.357 --> 20:28.057
- You nailed it.
- Here.

20:28.058 --> 20:30.126
Of course he did.
He's a great primary.

20:30.127 --> 20:32.462
And I'm sorry
I was such a bad number two.

20:32.463 --> 20:33.997
I may,
for the first time,

20:33.998 --> 20:34.998
have been a bit of a jerk,

20:35.032 --> 20:36.566
and I'm sorry.

20:36.567 --> 20:38.201
What a wonderful moment.

20:38.235 --> 20:40.403
I agree, it is
a wonderful moment.

20:40.437 --> 20:41.604
What a wonderful moment.
Rosa, do you agree?

20:41.605 --> 20:42.739
It's all right.
It's all right.

20:42.773 --> 20:45.475
- ♪ Wonderful moment
- ♪ Moment

20:45.476 --> 20:48.411
Both: ♪ Between two guys

20:48.412 --> 20:50.713
[phone vibrates]
Oh.

20:50.714 --> 20:52.315
D.A. wants to set bail
for Patterson's wife.

20:52.350 --> 20:53.950
They need me to send them
all the files.

20:53.984 --> 20:56.735
I'm the secondary.

20:56.736 --> 20:58.471
I'll go back there
and do the busy work.

20:58.472 --> 21:00.306
You guys stay here
and keep celebrating.

21:00.340 --> 21:02.107
You sure you're not
just sneaking off

21:02.108 --> 21:03.476
for more weird
dead guy sex?

21:03.510 --> 21:04.543
[Laughs]

21:04.544 --> 21:06.412
We will never
speak of that again.

21:06.413 --> 21:08.247
Never.

21:08.248 --> 21:09.648
Okay, bye.

21:09.649 --> 21:12.351
God.
Crazy day, huh?

21:12.385 --> 21:13.919
I hate small talk.

21:13.920 --> 21:15.120
Let's drink in silence.

21:15.121 --> 21:18.157
Perfect.
