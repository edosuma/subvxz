when you listen to what I sent you.

Wouldn't it have been easier
to try to convince your mom?

05:23.948 --> 05:25.158

05:25.241 --> 05:26.868
No. You know how she gets.

She doesn't want to hear anything
about musical theater.

Katherine never understood her daughter.

the word "empathy." [gasps]

so don't worry.

sooner or later she's going to find out.

We're in the middle of an audition here.

Allegra has no reason to be here.

15:40.357 --> 15:41.524
The audition isn't over.

15:41.608 --> 15:43.401
Your daughter is very talented, Caterina.

15:43.485 --> 15:45.653
Well, she gets it from her grandma, no?

15:45.737 --> 15:49.366
I didn't give permission for my daughter
to participate in this audition.

15:49.449 --> 15:52.994
Allegra is a minor. You should be
a little more responsible and check--

15:53.078 --> 15:55.497
I'm sorry.
I have a signed consent right here.

15:55.580 --> 15:56.623
No, I didn't sign anything.

15:56.706 --> 15:58.249
But it's your signature.

That is not my signature.

Excuse me. Excuse me.

Did you forge your mother's signature?

Oh, no, I love her. I love her.
I love that attitude.

Did you hear that?
That is what I want in this audition.

16:11.971 --> 16:14.182
That's the attitude. She's a hurricane.

Mom, please, I'm begging you
to let me finish the audition--

16:16.768 --> 16:18.520
No way. Forget about this audition.

16:31.741 --> 16:33.785
[Caterina] Welcome to adulthood, Allegra.

16:33.868 --> 16:36.371
Lesson number one:
lots of things don't make sense,

16:36.454 --> 16:39.666
or they make sense because I say so.
You're a minor, and I'm your mother.

16:39.749 --> 16:42.252
That doesn't make sense.
I need you to sign the permission slip.

16:42.335 --> 16:45.422
No. I already told you
that you have to finish high school.

16:45.505 --> 16:47.632
I'm sick of you
always telling me what to do.

16:47.716 --> 16:49.092
You never put yourself in my shoes.

16:49.175 --> 16:50.385
That's not true.

Do you know how long I've been practicing

I've always dreamed
of joining Eleven O'Clock.

16:57.475 --> 16:59.269
How could you lie to me like this?

16:59.352 --> 17:00.562
[Allegra] You left me no choice.

17:00.645 --> 17:04.065
Don't put this on me. It's not my fault.
Why didn't you tell me the truth?

17:04.149 --> 17:06.317
It's impossible to talk to you
about what I want to do.

I can't even have a poster

Don't change the subject.
The problem is that you lied to me.

17:11.239 --> 17:13.616
No. The problem is that
I want to perform musical theater

17:13.700 --> 17:16.327
and you, for some unknown reason, refuse.

17:16.411 --> 17:19.164
I want to be "Ellie," the lead in

17:21.166 --> 17:22.876
Why can't I say her name?
She's my grandma.

What happened between you two?
I want to know the truth.

Did you get checked out?

I'm here for the wrong reasons

34:28.318 --> 34:30.236
