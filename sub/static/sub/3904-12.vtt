WEBVTT

00:09.500 --> 00:12.227
- Who's got the scene ?
- Massey and Crutchfield are working it.

00:12.275 --> 00:15.120
Norris is on his way to the morgue.
He'll beat the bodies there.

00:17.100 --> 00:18.997
He's getting the full treatment, boss.

00:20.288 --> 00:22.101
We're good there.

00:22.350 --> 00:25.037
Just one witness so far.

00:26.041 --> 00:29.593
You know what that means.
Right now it's all BNBG.

00:29.811 --> 00:31.781
It's Andy Kraw's
big adventure.

00:32.369 --> 00:35.642
Mayor's office already called twice,
worried sick about the man.

00:35.676 --> 00:37.140
You're kidding me.

00:37.381 --> 00:39.322
That's a whole lotta
campaign contributions

00:39.336 --> 00:41.321
sitting on the back of that ambo.

00:41.461 --> 00:43.072
So what's the scene say ?

00:43.224 --> 00:46.320
Two shooters. Shotgun, semiauto.

00:46.357 --> 00:49.710
One vic is a West Side soldier
with a pretty healthy sheet

00:50.373 --> 00:54.115
the other is a major player
in Daniel's wiretap case.

00:54.200 --> 00:56.206
So a hit.
Drug related.

00:56.349 --> 00:58.065
With a big time developer
in the middle ?

00:58.079 --> 00:59.497
What's the fit ?

00:59.508 --> 01:01.713
Second vic, Russell Bell

01:02.293 --> 01:04.061
owner and co-developer
of this here.

01:05.507 --> 01:07.679
And other downtown
real estate.

01:08.483 --> 01:11.242
Well propertied man,
he was.

01:13.161 --> 01:14.900
But you were aware that Russell Bell

01:14.960 --> 01:17.452
was regarded as a major
narcotic violator.

01:18.697 --> 01:21.337
Well, how do you think
he made his money ?

01:21.774 --> 01:23.514
I didn't inquire.

01:23.562 --> 01:26.092
You never got a look
at either of the gunmen.

01:26.115 --> 01:30.015
I told you. I saw only the one of them.
He was black

01:30.548 --> 01:34.288
big, I thought,
with a large weapon.

01:35.956 --> 01:37.184
BNBG.

01:43.599 --> 01:45.899
Big negro, big gun.

01:47.000 --> 01:53.074

02:06.624 --> 02:09.155
Two more
like it upstairs.

02:09.161 --> 02:10.210
Yeah.

02:13.697 --> 02:18.392
Have ballistics rush comparisons.
Drug-relateds for the last six months.

03:29.845 --> 03:31.286
I caught him, Bunk.

03:33.266 --> 03:34.779
On the wire. I caught him.

03:37.951 --> 03:39.472
He doesn't
fuckin'know it.

05:16.773 --> 05:18.070
Mission Accomplished

05:23.712 --> 05:25.575
Boxing, yeah.

05:26.227 --> 05:27.437
I know
you loved that.

05:27.627 --> 05:31.109
Ugh, I hated it.
I hated watching it.

05:31.202 --> 05:32.569
Yeah,
I know you did.

05:32.663 --> 05:34.777
So you're
doing good, huh ?

05:35.847 --> 05:38.227
Day to day, I am.

05:38.281 --> 05:40.085
'Cause I was thinking
maybe...

05:46.987 --> 05:49.819
I'm proud of you, Dennis.
Be well.

06:03.321 --> 06:04.960
Shut that
fuckin'door.

06:18.382 --> 06:19.441
Man, fuck it.

06:20.065 --> 06:21.155
I'm ready for this shit.

06:21.183 --> 06:23.692
These niggers are snappin'on us.
You see ?

06:23.787 --> 06:25.966
Do you believe this fucking shit ?

06:26.071 --> 06:29.067
Some shit like this woulda never
happened with the old Barksdale.

06:30.208 --> 06:33.573
Yo, Slim, man.
Say the motherfuckin'word.

06:39.552 --> 06:40.435
Shit is on.

06:48.453 --> 06:49.317
'Sup, B ?

06:57.350 --> 06:58.185
You a'ight ?

06:59.012 --> 07:02.000
We gonna bounce back
on the motherfucker, no question.

07:02.081 --> 07:03.275
Bounce back on who ?

07:03.608 --> 07:06.346
Marlo, boss.
Oh, he gonna fall.

07:06.397 --> 07:08.602
Marlo, Marlo ain't got
shit to do with it.

07:08.782 --> 07:10.576
Marlo couldn't
get String like that.

07:10.800 --> 07:12.977
String died'cause of some other shit.

07:14.772 --> 07:15.383
What ?

07:15.454 --> 07:17.619
He died because
of some other shit, nigger.

07:19.987 --> 07:21.985
I couldn't fix it.
I tried.

07:22.698 --> 07:25.158
That nigger String was
right about this shit, man.

07:26.107 --> 07:27.092
That nigger was right.

07:27.114 --> 07:31.209
Fuck Marlo. Fuck this fucking war.

07:31.210 --> 07:34.247
All this beef over
a couple of fuckin'corners.

07:36.059 --> 07:38.859
Don't matter who did
what to who at this point.

07:38.880 --> 07:40.507
Fact is, we went to war

07:40.522 --> 07:42.731
and now there ain't no going back.

07:42.790 --> 07:44.365
I mean, shit

07:44.445 --> 07:46.004
it's what war is, you know.

07:46.410 --> 07:49.289
Once you in it, you in it.

07:51.495 --> 07:54.168
If it's a lie
then we fight on that lie

07:55.023 --> 07:56.495
but we gotta fight.

08:02.746 --> 08:05.288
Got this out of his pocket.

08:08.874 --> 08:09.946
I got no idea.

08:11.423 --> 08:12.923
It's a cell chip from a phone.

08:15.175 --> 08:16.573
What elsedid you get off him ?

08:16.731 --> 08:19.843
200 cash, set of keys, license.

08:20.056 --> 08:21.272
President Street address ?

08:22.651 --> 08:25.028
I got Landsman bangin'out
a warrant for the place.

08:27.727 --> 08:29.308
Fuck the politics for a minute.

08:30.267 --> 08:31.937
What if the man happens to be right ?

08:31.954 --> 08:33.433
Legalizing drugs ?

08:33.461 --> 08:35.402
Crime is down in his district and

08:35.416 --> 08:37.525
people on that side of town,
they're okay with it.

08:37.546 --> 08:40.014
Look, if you don't exist,
what happens here ?

08:40.078 --> 08:41.283
If there's no Tommy Carcetti

08:41.284 --> 08:42.960
in this thing,
what's likely to happen ?

08:43.020 --> 08:45.240
The mayor and Burrell,
they shut this thing down.

08:45.241 --> 08:46.934
I figure the Mayor's
trying to find a way

08:46.942 --> 08:49.434
to shuit down to make it look like
it was an enforcement plan

08:49.492 --> 08:50.529
in case it goes public

08:50.633 --> 08:53.573
otherwise he'd have
moved to end it already.

08:54.346 --> 08:57.258
Makes sense.
But no matter what

08:57.322 --> 08:59.315
Colvin's little experiment
is finished.

09:01.108 --> 09:02.191
Come on, Tommy.

09:02.954 --> 09:04.312
They dealt you a winning hand

09:04.313 --> 09:06.252
and you're acting like you
forgot how to play.

09:09.949 --> 09:13.514
Mr. Mayor, call it legalization
and my office can't live with it.

09:13.585 --> 09:15.264
Agreed.
No one can.

09:15.352 --> 09:16.609
But harm reduction.

09:16.641 --> 09:19.689
That could sell provided there's a
reduction in the crime rate.

09:19.736 --> 09:22.235
Harm reduction.
Sounds good.

09:22.402 --> 09:25.243
Steven, what if we were
able to suggest

09:25.274 --> 09:28.282
limiting our
street level enforcement

09:28.303 --> 09:32.281
we were concentrating our resources
on high-level traffickers.

09:32.377 --> 09:33.380
How would that play ?

09:33.395 --> 09:36.053
Well, if I could show off that kind
of casework, yeah, maybe.

09:36.126 --> 09:38.353
But they've been doing
street rips for so long now

09:38.465 --> 09:39.875
I don't think
a high level exists.

09:39.876 --> 09:42.193
What if we were able to say
that no major traffickers

09:42.244 --> 09:44.771
were allowed in the free zone--

09:46.626 --> 09:49.601
That the major violators
were still being targeted, huh ?

09:49.983 --> 09:52.116
Are you suggesting
some kind of admissions

09:52.131 --> 09:54.110
criteria for the zones ?
How would that work ?

09:54.138 --> 09:55.266
I don't know that it would.

09:55.293 --> 09:57.612
I'm just saying that for
the sake of public perception.

09:57.629 --> 09:59.921
Come on, people,
work with me on this thing.

10:00.765 --> 10:01.692
<i>Fucked up, ain't it ?</i>

10:01.767 --> 10:04.489
<i>Marlo need to get his ass
dropped, him and all his crew.</i>

10:04.537 --> 10:06.224
<i>They gonna fall.
You'll see.</i>

10:06.415 --> 10:08.404
<i>All right, let me know.</i>

10:08.515 --> 10:10.774
That's the word
on the wire, anyway.

10:11.029 --> 10:14.006
Every mention puts it
on Marlo Stanfield's crew

10:14.107 --> 10:17.130
which means the war's
gonna ratchet up, no question.

10:17.369 --> 10:18.706
Where's Jimmy ?

10:18.786 --> 10:21.683
He went with Bunk Moreland
to rifle Stringer's spot downtown.

10:21.937 --> 10:26.091
- How'd he take it ?
- Like Stringer was kin.

10:28.031 --> 10:29.393
<i>- Yeah ?
- Bushy Top</i>

10:29.536 --> 10:32.862
<i>- need to pull your coat up.
- Hey, what's up, Major ?</i>

10:32.957 --> 10:36.399
<i>I got somethin'for y'all.
Mount Vernon Square in about an hour.</i>

10:36.665 --> 10:38.468
I'm there.

11:03.535 --> 11:04.627
This is Stringer's ?

11:07.509 --> 11:08.129
Yeah.

11:35.911 --> 11:37.872
Who in fuck was I chasing ?

12:05.087 --> 12:08.012
What's done is done.

12:19.353 --> 12:22.877
Gay ass gangsters.
Please.

12:34.065 --> 12:36.885
I took it for as long as I could.

12:40.886 --> 12:42.137
Let's go, man.

12:43.936 --> 12:44.628
Let's go.

13:03.675 --> 13:07.394
It being your town, I trust you
to do it proper.

13:19.320 --> 13:20.703
You off today, boss ?

13:21.232 --> 13:23.233
Every day, at this point.

13:23.247 --> 13:26.247
I told 'em over at COMSTAT
about my little experiment.

13:26.768 --> 13:28.741
Bosses went crazy, huh ?

13:29.378 --> 13:31.940
Anyway, that's why I called you.

13:32.529 --> 13:35.250
That there is a wartime lay-up
for your man Barksdale.

13:35.512 --> 13:37.108
My sources tell me the man's there

13:37.146 --> 13:38.817
most of the time
with a lot of muscle :

13:38.912 --> 13:41.279
sawed-offs, semiautos, Mac-11s.

13:41.954 --> 13:43.955
Whole lot of good shit
if you hit it right.

13:45.173 --> 13:47.055
- That's a hell of a tip.
- Shit.

13:48.864 --> 13:51.198
That right there might be
the last bit of police work

13:51.217 --> 13:52.594
in a long and storied career.

13:53.435 --> 13:55.201
I'll talk to you, Bushy Top.

14:02.553 --> 14:03.955
Which one is Ali ?

14:05.005 --> 14:06.709
In the white trunks, boy.

14:07.328 --> 14:09.174
- Damn, he look young.
- He was.

14:09.247 --> 14:11.777
This the Patterson fight
right here. Old school.

14:12.262 --> 14:14.171
Who Patterson ?
He soft.

14:14.235 --> 14:16.129
Ali whippin'his ass.

14:16.284 --> 14:18.044
He was a champ too.

14:18.179 --> 14:20.939
Look, any man still standing
at the end of a round

14:21.094 --> 14:24.133
you can't call him soft.
That's a rule, all right ?

14:30.214 --> 14:31.884
From Stringer's place downtown.

14:32.011 --> 14:35.529
B and B shit, college papers,
real estate stuff.

14:35.863 --> 14:38.758
There's no phone extension
in the place, just these.

14:38.839 --> 14:41.132
Cell phone chips.'Bout 100 of them.

14:41.197 --> 14:43.436
So that's why he wasn't
taking any phones

14:43.451 --> 14:44.809
from our man Bernard, huh ?

14:44.853 --> 14:45.987
Stringer had his own phone

14:46.003 --> 14:48.433
he just changed the number every
time he changed the chip.

14:48.452 --> 14:51.201
Shamrock too, probably, with
whatever phone he used to call Bell.

14:51.239 --> 14:52.076
Cautious man.

14:53.706 --> 14:54.598
Yes and no.

14:54.915 --> 14:58.353
Have a look in here.
All different manufacturers.

15:05.406 --> 15:07.189
Before Stringer Bell got aced

15:08.284 --> 15:10.986
he went out of his way to put in
his good friend Avon Barksdale.

15:12.805 --> 15:14.253
That's a Barksdale safe house.

15:16.011 --> 15:17.241
Where'd you get this ?

15:21.776 --> 15:22.438
Colvin.

15:24.042 --> 15:26.780
- Calls to the Western.
- Where's Daniels ?

15:27.466 --> 15:30.267
He's got this thing downtown.
It's for his wife.

15:30.701 --> 15:31.758
You should raise him.

15:34.292 --> 15:36.200
It's not enough
to make up for Stringer.

15:37.626 --> 15:38.977
It'll do for now.

15:41.243 --> 15:42.497
Because the neighborhoods

15:42.557 --> 15:44.631
and the residents
in this district are among

15:44.737 --> 15:47.653
the poorest in our city.
And it is these residents

15:47.888 --> 15:50.727
who most need
a strong voice at City Hall.

15:51.435 --> 15:53.174
Time has come for a change.

15:53.175 --> 15:55.946
<i>And I believe I can
bring about that change</i>

15:56.641 --> 16:00.217
<i>by providing a strong voice
for the new 11th District</i>

16:01.621 --> 16:02.879
<i>if you will do me the honor--</i>

16:02.974 --> 16:05.932
It's kind of cool, the lieutenant's wife
running for office, you know.

16:07.040 --> 16:10.223
<i>Well, as you just heard,
West Baltimore City</i>

16:10.225 --> 16:13.247
<i>Council woman Eunetta Perkins
is going to have her hands full</i>

16:13.263 --> 16:15.237
<i>in next September's
Democratic finals.</i>

16:16.796 --> 16:18.657
Stringer Bell.
Damn.

16:20.239 --> 16:21.434
Who could have got to him ?

16:21.649 --> 16:23.702
I mean, if it wasn't y'all on it.

16:24.107 --> 16:26.024
You know Avon's gonna
put it on you, right ?

16:26.312 --> 16:28.142
Shit, let him take it
on my jacket.

16:28.324 --> 16:29.645
Don't make me no never mind.

16:30.043 --> 16:32.734
I'm thinkin'it might be what
you call one of them good problems.

16:34.174 --> 16:35.081
Yeah.

16:40.978 --> 16:43.253
I heard Colvin's
in deep shit downtown.

16:44.144 --> 16:45.688
Looking at this right here

16:47.868 --> 16:49.253
he might not be the only one.

16:51.170 --> 16:52.651
Anything comes up,
I'm on the radio.

16:55.261 --> 16:58.237
My man, my man, my man.
Yo, you think I could get like $5 ?

16:58.348 --> 17:01.116
- I need like $5 to get on the bus.
- I look like a tourist to you ?

17:01.245 --> 17:03.521
- Man, I swear to God.
- Lookin'like that

17:03.576 --> 17:05.134
walking into
an open-air drug market

17:05.171 --> 17:07.171
why the hell would
I think you'll spend my $5

17:07.201 --> 17:08.380
on bus fare ?

17:09.695 --> 17:12.226
Shit,'cause I already
got my blast, man.

18:05.188 --> 18:10.550
All night you been drinking
like your ass is candy.

18:11.812 --> 18:12.985
That's shameful shit.

18:19.679 --> 18:21.009
12-gauge pumpkin balls.

18:24.264 --> 18:27.334
Last time I saw that kind of load
was the Pimlico double

18:27.799 --> 18:31.842
and I fuckin'know that motherfucker
was in the middle of that mess.

18:33.084 --> 18:34.903
And if I remember your boy

18:34.921 --> 18:37.755
he had no love
for the Barksdale people.

18:37.965 --> 18:40.386
Execution style, that don't play
like Omar Little.

18:42.024 --> 18:45.430
Besides, the word on our wire
is that Marlo's people did Stringer.

18:46.024 --> 18:48.635
- Marlo Stanfield ?
- The heir apparent.

18:49.306 --> 18:50.674
This city's going to hell, man.

18:53.285 --> 18:55.947
We're gonna push past 300 murders
before New Year's.

18:56.120 --> 18:58.920
Shit is fucked.

19:02.659 --> 19:05.311
Oh, hey, Cheryl.

19:05.955 --> 19:09.536
No ? My guess is she's, uh,
picking up a prisoner.

19:09.902 --> 19:12.074
Yeah, I spoke to her
about ten minutes ago.

19:12.336 --> 19:15.002
Yeah, well, they make you
check your stuff.

19:15.687 --> 19:18.711
Cell phone, money, weapon.

19:19.181 --> 19:21.694
Well, she'll call
when she gets the message.

19:22.244 --> 19:24.218
Not at all.

19:25.070 --> 19:27.233
I need more, Jimmy.

19:42.584 --> 19:43.729
More !

19:45.433 --> 19:46.928
Motherfucker.

19:47.326 --> 19:48.201
I'm tired, Bunk.

19:59.325 --> 20:00.122
Let's go.

20:03.066 --> 20:04.508
I heard the vanguard met.

20:05.179 --> 20:07.803
Heard they voted to have a
civilian review board look at it.

20:07.833 --> 20:11.759
It wasn't unanimous. And there were
people there speaking for you.

20:12.094 --> 20:13.287
I heard that too.

20:14.505 --> 20:18.946
So six out of ten black officers
think I'm just an asshole racist.

20:19.359 --> 20:21.214
On the other hand

20:21.754 --> 20:24.572
four out of ten
think you're just an asshole.

20:27.913 --> 20:32.035
It's an administrative charge.
You can fight it and win

20:32.067 --> 20:33.197
if you want.

20:33.396 --> 20:36.706
Failure to properly identify myself
as a police officer.

20:38.703 --> 20:41.341
Sounds like what I was guilty of
most of my career, actually.

20:44.671 --> 20:46.613
I'm not sure
I was supposed to be a police.

20:49.000 --> 20:50.178
Not really.

20:52.105 --> 20:53.813
What were ya supposed to be, huh ?

21:01.793 --> 21:03.289
This is from Major Colvin's CI ?

21:03.902 --> 21:05.382
What's the corroboration ?

21:05.796 --> 21:09.154
Well, the source knew that Barksdale
had a waterfront condo in his own name

21:09.265 --> 21:11.476
gave the accurate location,
and title info

21:11.501 --> 21:12.964
down to deed of transfer.

21:13.634 --> 21:16.496
Well, that's good, but it puts him on
the legitimate side of things.

21:16.785 --> 21:19.107
What corroboration is there
for illegal activities ?

21:20.269 --> 21:21.830
Sorry I'm late.

21:21.988 --> 21:23.245
I had to stop in at a friend.

21:23.341 --> 21:25.457
The source knew that Barksdale
was shot last month

21:25.458 --> 21:26.524
wounded in the shoulder.

21:26.755 --> 21:29.238
- Emergency room ?
- No, no hospital reports.

21:30.484 --> 21:31.598
We're gonna need better.

21:31.662 --> 21:34.813
Either Colvin goes back to the CI
or we sit on this address for a while.

21:34.925 --> 21:37.279
- we can see.
- Well, fuck it, then.

21:37.955 --> 21:40.260
Let's name the source.
Put him right in the affidavit.

21:40.287 --> 21:42.692
- It's Colvin's call, isn't it ?
- It's Stringer Bell.

21:44.973 --> 21:46.898
Lester figured it out from the DNRs.

21:47.608 --> 21:49.740
Bell was snitching out Barksdale.

21:50.226 --> 21:52.660
- You're sure of this ?
- Maybe that explains the murder.

21:52.740 --> 21:53.870
What's in the wire ?

21:54.467 --> 21:56.328
Loose talk about how
it was Marlo's people

21:56.345 --> 21:58.223
but nothing past rumor.

21:58.301 --> 22:00.976
With Bell gone, Barksdale might
have to come down a notch

22:00.999 --> 22:03.928
to oversee the day to day, and
maybe that puts him in contact

22:03.943 --> 22:06.284
with some of our
monitored cell phones.

22:06.443 --> 22:09.261
If he's as cautious
as Stringer, maybe not.

22:10.008 --> 22:12.362
My guess is Barksdale
never touches a cell phone.

22:12.952 --> 22:14.655
Safe house might be our best shot.

22:16.263 --> 22:17.170
All right.

22:18.196 --> 22:20.199
We stay on the wires until
this batch of burners

22:20.200 --> 22:22.406
goes dead, hoping
we have Barksdale

22:22.540 --> 22:24.068
but meanwhile, we get a warrant

22:24.085 --> 22:25.910
for that safe house
and wait on him there.

22:35.501 --> 22:37.808
Thanks for the cover last night.

22:43.240 --> 22:46.503
This is Greggs, Major Case Unit.
Who's the shift leader ?

23:18.217 --> 23:20.928
Holy Christ.

23:35.314 --> 23:37.343
<i>- They're all over it, Commissioner.
- Right</i>

23:39.413 --> 23:41.143
That was Foxtrot.

23:41.253 --> 23:43.799
The cameras have found our
little shit pile.

23:43.919 --> 23:46.684
Your fuckin'councilman
took his sweet time, didn't he ?

23:49.060 --> 23:50.890
Everyone's a critic.

23:51.279 --> 23:53.976
If this doesn't go, what line
of work are you gonna try next ?

23:56.661 --> 23:57.969
We're here in West Baltimore--

24:03.136 --> 24:05.814
For more than a month, police
from Baltimore's Western District.

24:05.834 --> 24:07.632
It's just an outrageous development.

24:14.483 --> 24:17.665
It's something I never thought I'd see
from this or any other administration.

24:18.104 --> 24:20.301
Frankly, this is one of the
reasons we need a change

24:20.330 --> 24:21.456
in leadership in this city.

24:21.484 --> 24:23.907
Did the Mayor know ?
What about the Police Commissioner ?

24:23.936 --> 24:26.386
These are questions for the
Mayor and Police Commissioner.

24:26.414 --> 24:28.367
These are central issues
of crime and safety.

24:28.386 --> 24:30.282
The Royce administration
is simply bankrupt.

24:30.320 --> 24:32.395
You still gonna announce
for mayor next month ?

24:32.474 --> 24:34.178
Standing here today
looking at this ?

24:34.312 --> 24:36.852
I can't see I can do anything
but put it out there right now.

24:36.881 --> 24:39.262
All I can tell you is that
for more than four weeks now

24:39.301 --> 24:41.140
the Baltimore Police
Department surrendered

24:41.159 --> 24:43.214
portions of the police district
to the drug trade

24:43.234 --> 24:44.872
and the Council was not informed.

24:44.999 --> 24:49.121
Fuck me. I fuckin' had this story
all to myself a week ago.

24:50.004 --> 24:52.344
<i>Police officers for weeks
have turned a blind eye...</i>

24:52.408 --> 24:54.397
What the fuck was I thinking ?

24:56.266 --> 24:58.065
<i>..sanctioning open-air
drug markets.</i>

24:58.876 --> 24:59.620
'Scuse us.

24:59.621 --> 25:05.131
<i>...in the so called free zones,
drug dealers routinely ply...</i>

25:05.163 --> 25:07.152
Mr. Mayor,
Commissioner Burrell is here.

25:07.200 --> 25:09.841
Tell the Commissioner the Mayor
will be with him shortly.

25:09.936 --> 25:12.293
<i>And young children run
the streets alone.</i>

25:13.144 --> 25:15.181
<i>The inhabitants of what
has come to be known</i>

25:15.197 --> 25:18.706
<i>as Hampsterdam have little
to say for the camera.</i>

25:18.770 --> 25:20.823
<i>But channel 5 has learned
that the police were...</i>

25:23.217 --> 25:23.838
Yeah ?

25:23.919 --> 25:25.080
<i>What are you seein'?</i>

25:25.224 --> 25:28.025
Coupla people in and out.
No sign of Barksdale, though.

25:28.277 --> 25:29.384
<i>It's quiet here too.</i>

25:29.648 --> 25:30.697
Okay.

25:31.605 --> 25:32.830
Need to look at the back.

25:33.244 --> 25:35.790
Our friend Carcetti's gonna
run wild with this.

25:36.745 --> 25:39.785
And from the sound of things,
Gray is gonna run with him.

25:39.952 --> 25:43.039
Tony Gray thinks he's gonna
get my chair behind this bullshit

25:43.946 --> 25:45.688
We're throwin'you out
of the boat, Ervin.

25:45.698 --> 25:47.059
This shit is on you alone.

25:50.059 --> 25:51.506
Not necessarily.

25:51.657 --> 25:54.030
Not if I talk about how
we were under pressure

25:54.122 --> 25:55.401
to keep the crime down

25:55.402 --> 25:57.583
to juke the stats
district by district...

25:57.782 --> 25:58.856
You never said that.

25:58.896 --> 26:02.039
About how Colvin under pressure,
lost his way

26:02.106 --> 26:03.792
about how I came to you
weeks ago...

26:03.994 --> 26:05.587
- Days ago.
- Weeks ago

26:05.604 --> 26:07.992
to tell you what he had
done and to assure you that

26:08.082 --> 26:09.886
we were on top of the situation

26:09.901 --> 26:13.106
that Colvin would be relieved
and his plan aborted.

26:13.297 --> 26:14.920
You lyin'motherfucker.

26:15.015 --> 26:18.246
But you heard about the drop
in Colvin's felony rate

26:18.389 --> 26:20.108
and you sent me packing.

26:20.443 --> 26:24.021
Brought in your liberal-ass
do-gooders to seriously consider

26:24.022 --> 26:25.661
this horseshit

26:25.883 --> 26:28.256
while Colvin's
mistake grew and grew.

26:28.835 --> 26:31.756
My hands were tied, Mr. Mayor

26:32.004 --> 26:34.439
my department thwarted.

26:35.241 --> 26:38.249
I was a prisoner
of the goddamn politicians.

26:39.078 --> 26:40.035
Or...

26:44.456 --> 26:48.529
I leave your office right now
willing to say a lot less than that.

26:48.874 --> 26:51.850
I put what I can
on crazy-ass Bunny Colvin

26:52.203 --> 26:57.554
and I take the hit.
And if Carcetti or Gray holds hearings

26:58.130 --> 27:01.751
I'm the wall between them and you.

27:02.448 --> 27:05.929
In which case, I am your commissioner

27:06.079 --> 27:08.983
for the full five-year term.

27:18.795 --> 27:21.032
Unit one to unit two.

27:21.342 --> 27:25.097
- Unit two standing by.
- Deal's made.

27:27.124 --> 27:30.555
Unit two to sector three,
move on the Winchester Homes.

27:30.679 --> 27:32.330
<i>Ten-four. We're moving.</i>

27:32.500 --> 27:34.135
Unit two to sector two.

27:34.359 --> 27:35.766
Move on the Koppers plant.

27:35.871 --> 27:36.945
<i>Roger that.</i>

27:40.253 --> 27:42.217
Over the top, gentlemen.

28:03.026 --> 28:04.643
'Bout fucking time.

28:15.977 --> 28:18.667
Man, g outaigo re-up.

28:19.113 --> 28:21.739
- Where Tuckie at ?
- I don't know.

28:26.043 --> 28:28.174
- Yo, where Tuckie at, man ?
- He rolled out.

28:28.255 --> 28:30.148
- He said the police comin'.

28:35.480 --> 28:38.432
- D'oh.
- Here they come. Let's roll.

29:04.079 --> 29:05.956
Hold it right there

29:13.021 --> 29:15.265
White jacket !
Stop right there ! Stop !

29:22.149 --> 29:24.281
Freeze ! Police, don't move !

29:27.004 --> 29:29.361
<i>Outstanding, red team.
Oustanding.</i>

29:29.803 --> 29:31.475
<i>Give you a case
of beer for that one.</i>

29:51.639 --> 29:54.010
Son, this nigga Stringer Bell, man

29:54.527 --> 29:56.388
was beggin'Chris, yo, for real.

29:56.718 --> 29:57.793
Like know what I mean ?

29:57.821 --> 30:00.418
Diggin'in his pockets,
talkin' 'bout how much cheese

30:00.518 --> 30:03.336
he gonna give us, I mean,
if we just let him walk.

30:03.390 --> 30:06.212
My man Chris holler,
"Man, bitch, you gonna die."

30:06.487 --> 30:08.619
This nigga just dropped
to his fuckin' knees like

30:08.635 --> 30:11.380
a little cocksucker,
man, start cryin'.

30:11.460 --> 30:13.593
That shit was worse
than fuckin' pathetic.

30:16.098 --> 30:20.045
- Yo, that's Marlo.
- Get on yo'burner, man.

30:27.510 --> 30:30.215
<i>- Got a line on him.
- The number one ? Where at ?</i>

30:30.278 --> 30:32.578
<i>Tall man says
to tell y'all to soldier up.</i>

30:32.653 --> 30:35.709
<i>They up at the rim shop.</i>

30:37.928 --> 30:40.762
- Boss, you okay ?
- What you want ?

30:40.857 --> 30:43.253
Slim said they got
their eye on Marlo.

30:44.473 --> 30:47.784
I'm just sayin', you know,
all the boys, they all waitin'on you.

30:48.983 --> 30:50.494
Go ahead, man.

30:51.090 --> 30:52.132
I'm behind you.

31:15.449 --> 31:17.403
What else you need
from us, Deputy ?

31:17.418 --> 31:19.282
City Hall wants
the bulldozers through here

31:19.301 --> 31:21.552
at dawnand then fencing
all around the site.

31:21.658 --> 31:23.951
Winchester Homes
and the Koppers plant as well.

31:24.404 --> 31:25.805
We got it.

31:27.667 --> 31:29.576
Come tomorrow,
the television reporters

31:29.671 --> 31:32.011
get nothing they can
stand in front of.

31:32.104 --> 31:35.337
'Scuse me, Deputy,
sir, we found a body.

31:46.031 --> 31:47.131
Any trauma ?

31:47.751 --> 31:50.089
Can't tell for sure
with all the rat bites.

31:50.861 --> 31:53.170
Take him to OCME
in a jail wagon.

31:53.240 --> 31:56.041
I don't want the fuckin'
reporters seeing any ambos.

31:57.864 --> 31:58.960
Shit.

32:09.824 --> 32:12.577
<i>He just landed. Him plus one.</i>

32:12.832 --> 32:14.518
Got it. Sit tight.

32:14.566 --> 32:15.681
That makes how many ?

32:18.068 --> 32:20.518
Including Barksdale, Sydnor
counted ten in

32:20.599 --> 32:22.667
and one comin'out,
so that's ten at least.

32:27.278 --> 32:28.886
2301 to KGA.

32:29.622 --> 32:31.040
<i>Go ahead, 2301.</i>

32:31.829 --> 32:35.707
We need QRT to meet us at our 20
for a search and seizure.

32:35.770 --> 32:39.624
Location has multiple suspects
and may contain automatic weapons.

32:39.660 --> 32:40.675
<i>Ten-four.</i>

32:49.283 --> 32:50.637
Word travels fast, huh ?

32:51.969 --> 32:52.642
Shit.

32:55.189 --> 32:57.614
Burrell called Johns Hopkins
personally this morning.

33:01.702 --> 33:03.323
Dragged your name into the gutter.

33:03.324 --> 33:05.557
Johns Hopkins doesn't
need the notoriety.

33:05.618 --> 33:08.652
The chief academic officer of a
major research university

33:08.776 --> 33:10.664
doesn't want to hear
that some new hire

33:10.665 --> 33:12.482
makes up the rules
as he goes along.

33:18.425 --> 33:19.544
Yeah, Colvin.

33:25.749 --> 33:27.243
COMSTAT tomorrow.

33:33.372 --> 33:33.835
I'm up.

33:41.226 --> 33:42.351
Y'all taking a door ?

33:43.064 --> 33:44.012
Where's tactical ?

33:45.220 --> 33:46.453
I called for QRT.

33:47.027 --> 33:48.004
You ain't heard ?

33:48.056 --> 33:50.744
They're a little busy tonight
tearin'down Colvin's fuck up.

33:50.926 --> 33:53.775
With all that goin'on,
you're lucky you even got us.

33:53.895 --> 33:56.949
- Who he hittin' on this ?
- Avon Barksdale and crew.

33:57.132 --> 34:00.650
I fuckin' told you he was out.
Did i fuckin' tell you ?

34:01.159 --> 34:03.228
I fuckin' told her.

34:03.363 --> 34:06.807
<i>For more than four weeks,
the Baltimore Police Department...</i>

34:08.201 --> 34:11.081
By tomorrow, the story goes national
and Washington reacts.

34:13.174 --> 34:15.170
Save the best
questions for Tony Gray.

34:16.181 --> 34:18.389
He needs to shine
even more than you.

34:27.663 --> 34:29.259
I can't believe
he wants us to knock.

34:29.297 --> 34:31.110
Well, you can' flush
guns, now, can you ?

34:31.177 --> 34:33.193
Well, fuck that.
What if they open up on us ?

34:33.259 --> 34:35.244
These guys are
at war with another crew.

34:35.342 --> 34:37.952
We go chargin'in there,
chances are we will get lit up.

34:52.737 --> 34:53.808
Yo, B.

34:54.630 --> 34:57.241
Sham sayin'that Charles
sayin'they still up at the rim shop.

34:57.384 --> 35:00.376
Marlo, his boy Chris,
and Vinson, they still eatin'

35:00.455 --> 35:03.018
but the rest of the muscle,
they rolled out.

35:12.234 --> 35:12.892
<i>Police !</i>

35:14.655 --> 35:15.219
No.

35:16.372 --> 35:17.446
Not the police.

35:17.470 --> 35:20.349
- Narco's out back too.
- Shit.

35:20.810 --> 35:24.261
<i>Let us in !
We know you're in there.</i>

35:27.132 --> 35:29.341
<i>Open the door,
you fucking cocksuckers !</i>

35:29.369 --> 35:30.366
Fucked up, man.

35:30.441 --> 35:32.179
Y'all ask me

35:32.911 --> 35:34.854
y'all ugly ass niggers
shouldn't be in here

35:34.855 --> 35:36.658
fucking around
with all these guns and shit

35:39.187 --> 35:40.083
Open it.

35:44.696 --> 35:47.814
<i>Come on, Avon. Enough with this shit.
Open the fucking door.</i>

35:51.064 --> 35:54.164
<i>Open the fucking door,
you cocksuckers.</i>

35:54.979 --> 35:55.881
Police !

36:00.689 --> 36:02.281
- Search warrant !
- I'm clean, man.

36:02.892 --> 36:05.343
<i>Open the fucking door.</i>

36:08.619 --> 36:09.448
Get down !

36:09.449 --> 36:11.519
Face that shit tight. Greggs.

36:11.598 --> 36:12.998
I'm opening up.

36:19.754 --> 36:21.458
That'd be mine.

36:21.481 --> 36:23.264
In fact,
all that's mine.

36:23.336 --> 36:25.978
You got a law degree ?

36:28.469 --> 36:29.599
Take him.

36:30.378 --> 36:33.974
You fall on the parole violation.
No matter whatever else happens

36:34.006 --> 36:35.955
you do every day of
what's left of your seven

36:35.973 --> 36:36.875
without seeing a jury.

36:36.884 --> 36:39.020
Maybe even conspiracy to murder.

36:39.035 --> 36:42.696
We take this federal, see if we can
get you ten to life... no parole.

36:42.871 --> 36:44.980
Whatever.

36:45.309 --> 36:48.301
Shit, you only do two days no how.

36:48.516 --> 36:51.810
- That's the day you go in.
- And the day you come out.

36:52.104 --> 36:54.237
Yeah, well, here's the warrant.

37:00.951 --> 37:02.060
You read it slow.

37:04.392 --> 37:06.788
In between them two days,
give you something to think on.

37:26.312 --> 37:26.980
Damn.

37:27.557 --> 37:28.894
Missed our shot.

37:30.592 --> 37:31.232
Roll, man.

37:34.421 --> 37:36.431
You bend over for us,
or I swear to God

37:36.459 --> 37:38.163
I will spend what's
left of my career

37:38.194 --> 37:40.709
shitting on every last
supervisor in your district.

37:40.756 --> 37:43.421
From shift commanders down
to sector sergeants, not one of them

37:43.450 --> 37:46.923
will have any rank at all if we
hear so much as a bark out of you.

37:47.090 --> 37:49.669
Look, my people saw this as a
tactical deployment only.

37:49.995 --> 37:51.530
The responsibility is mine alone.

37:51.531 --> 37:53.432
Well, you won't fall alone

37:54.020 --> 37:57.522
unless you're willing to fall exactly
as we want you to.

37:58.023 --> 38:00.905
After COMSTAT,
you go to retirement services

38:00.960 --> 38:03.681
and drop papers, going out
at a lieutenant's grade

38:03.721 --> 38:06.983
That's right, you're busted back.
We can't take your EOD away

38:07.150 --> 38:09.330
but you're not going out
on a major's pay.

38:09.331 --> 38:11.289
I can retire before you bust me.

38:11.703 --> 38:13.581
I got vacation time
enough to make my 30.

38:13.708 --> 38:15.880
Fuck your vacation time.

38:16.612 --> 38:19.556
You're out today, at the lower grade.

38:19.597 --> 38:21.760
That's against the goddamn contract.

38:21.881 --> 38:23.972
What part of bend over
didn't you understand ?

38:27.450 --> 38:28.882
Avon locked up ?

38:28.947 --> 38:30.617
With most of his muscle, yeah.

38:30.633 --> 38:33.100
Good day to get back out
on them corners, ain't it ?

38:34.612 --> 38:36.713
Make some money.

38:36.728 --> 38:38.066
You bet.

38:48.574 --> 38:50.858
It's not just the 17 millions
in federal funding

38:50.992 --> 38:53.497
for Baltimore law enforcement
that you've jeopardized.

38:53.521 --> 38:56.500
Take off another 200 million of federal
money in your operating budget

38:56.527 --> 38:59.051
another 75 in capital expenditures,

38:59.472 --> 39:02.545
plus untold millions in pass-through
federal dollars from Annapolis.

39:03.498 --> 39:05.457
All told, we're talking about

39:05.926 --> 39:08.615
half a billion a year that Baltimore
will be doing without.

39:08.712 --> 39:11.449
Furthermore, the U.S. Attorney here
will use all the resources

39:11.536 --> 39:13.740
of the Justice Department
to interdict and destroy

39:13.785 --> 39:15.425
any attempt to establish

39:15.443 --> 39:19.087
a geographic entity
where drugs are legal.

39:19.597 --> 39:22.207
Washington should know that
what happened in West Baltimore

39:22.350 --> 39:25.407
in no way reflects the policies
of my administration.

39:25.717 --> 39:27.387
That was an aberration,
Mr. Talmadge.

39:27.388 --> 39:29.680
The work of one
misguided police official.

39:29.854 --> 39:31.684
We understand your concerns

39:31.732 --> 39:34.994
but for the deputy drug czar

39:35.115 --> 39:37.628
to take the time out
to drive 30 miles north

39:37.644 --> 39:40.095
to deliver that message,
hardly necessary.

39:41.973 --> 39:43.548
Rest assured.

39:47.710 --> 39:49.094
What up, G ?

39:49.835 --> 39:51.959
Where the older ones at ?

39:52.329 --> 39:54.366
Marlo got his package back out.

40:05.584 --> 40:08.608
Fire Burrell.
This nonsense began in his shop

40:08.815 --> 40:11.535
without him knowing it.
Fire the man and move on.

40:11.783 --> 40:14.185
Odell, I respect your opinion.

40:15.204 --> 40:16.049
But right now

40:16.986 --> 40:19.970
Tony Gray, Carcetti maneuvering

40:20.018 --> 40:22.374
now is not the time.

40:23.702 --> 40:27.016
We get past the primary, then I'll drive
a stake in his heart.

40:27.117 --> 40:28.652
But right now
I need him where he is

40:28.672 --> 40:29.997
for no other reason than to

40:30.132 --> 40:32.178
well, to take the hit
for this thing right here.

40:32.196 --> 40:33.967
But I tell you what
I'm gonna do, though.

40:34.127 --> 40:36.753
I'm gonna shine on that new girl
you like in the 11th.

40:38.139 --> 40:40.274
Give her a spot on the ticket.
Cut Eunetta loose.

40:40.301 --> 40:41.362
Eunetta's had her day.

40:43.382 --> 40:46.278
I respect the fact that
you stood by me, Odell.

40:46.319 --> 40:47.625
I respect loyalty.

40:49.684 --> 40:52.771
And did so without properly
informing his superior officers

40:53.446 --> 40:56.598
and without regard to the criminal
statutes he was sworn to enforce

40:57.067 --> 40:59.931
thereby disgracing himself
and his command.

41:02.684 --> 41:05.002
Is any of that subject
to any contradiction

41:05.003 --> 41:07.368
or argument whatsoever,
Major Colvin ?

41:07.698 --> 41:08.270
No, sir.

41:08.684 --> 41:09.988
No argument at all, Bunny ?

41:10.793 --> 41:12.160
Not much you can say, is there ?

41:12.161 --> 41:13.847
Not to real police.

41:14.715 --> 41:16.924
- Get on with it,motherfu--
- 'Scuse me, major ?

41:19.076 --> 41:21.319
Is the admin lieutenant present ?

41:23.126 --> 41:25.178
Major Colvin is relieved of duty.

41:25.267 --> 41:28.353
You are now the acting commander
of the Western District.

42:02.802 --> 42:05.001
- Hey, Bunk.
- Hey, Freamon.

42:05.066 --> 42:07.642
- Who is that ? Crutchfield ?

42:07.643 --> 42:09.266
- Naw, Norris.

42:09.291 --> 42:10.945
Sleeping on a stakeout.

42:11.028 --> 42:13.425
<i>Damn, Bernard, didn't I tell
you about these guys ?</i>

42:16.254 --> 42:18.688
Yeah, that's everyone
we heard on the wire.

42:18.749 --> 42:20.824
McNulty's over there in number
one with Pearlman.

42:20.852 --> 42:22.484
Why don't you say hey ?

42:26.819 --> 42:29.142
You got to be
the stupidest motherfucker

42:29.190 --> 42:31.037
that I've ever gone out with.

42:31.340 --> 42:33.170
I can't wait to go to jail.

42:34.116 --> 42:35.739
What ? What you say ?

42:35.795 --> 42:38.373
What the fuck did you say, Bernard ?

42:49.561 --> 42:50.882
Hey, Donald.

42:55.981 --> 42:57.917
- You heard the tapes.
- Look, he came to me

42:58.035 --> 43:00.659
and said we could sell drugs
if we move down to Vincent Street

43:00.668 --> 43:02.039
and that's where I moved my crew.

43:02.058 --> 43:04.940
And you know I did because you the one
that popped me with the G-pack

43:04.941 --> 43:07.416
on my way to the spot,
and let me go, remember ?

43:07.742 --> 43:10.321
You were selling drugs
in Major Colvin's free zone ?

43:10.488 --> 43:12.986
- You can prove that.
- Ask him. He know.

43:13.774 --> 43:15.938
This must be one of them
contrapment things.

43:16.018 --> 43:17.638
You mean entrapment.

43:17.639 --> 43:20.037
Kid's got a point.

43:27.110 --> 43:29.481
19 in bracelets
from Barksdale on down.

43:29.489 --> 43:31.208
Another eight wanted on warrants.

43:31.216 --> 43:35.020
Any way you can tie your case
to this mess with Colvin ?

43:35.021 --> 43:38.161
Make it like what he was
doing led to your thing ?

43:38.162 --> 43:39.149
I don't see it.

43:39.341 --> 43:43.532
Well, it's good work
nonetheless, Major Daniels.

43:46.789 --> 43:48.922
Call came in from the Mayor's office

43:48.978 --> 43:51.954
half hour ago
approving your promotion.

43:52.033 --> 43:54.813
And now with Colvin,
there's a new vacancy.

43:57.404 --> 43:59.823
- What about my wife ?
- What about her ?

43:59.943 --> 44:02.425
The Mayor. Eunetta's seat.

44:02.442 --> 44:04.697
- Why would the Mayor...
- Good police work maybe.

44:08.576 --> 44:11.027
Not everything is politics.

44:15.579 --> 44:17.584
Hey, I'll take two. Western alumni.

44:17.624 --> 44:18.992
All right, you got it.

44:19.804 --> 44:20.604
Major.

44:23.282 --> 44:24.031
I heard.

44:26.251 --> 44:27.581
How's your family take it ?

44:33.340 --> 44:36.113
Lolita done dropped herself
30 pounds and got herself

44:36.145 --> 44:37.493
a real estate license

44:38.862 --> 44:40.684
so I guess she's fixin'to leave me.

44:49.556 --> 44:52.540
I just wanted you to know
that last tip you gave me

44:52.541 --> 44:53.886
was a winner.

44:54.370 --> 44:55.612
Yeah, I heard.

44:56.130 --> 44:57.024
That's good work.

45:00.976 --> 45:03.697
Also, I don't know if you know,
Stringer Bell was shot to death

45:03.697 --> 45:04.780
two days ago.

45:06.705 --> 45:09.936
So anyway,
I put his name on the paper

45:10.110 --> 45:11.181
to tighten the PC.

45:13.286 --> 45:15.657
I figured what the fuck
once he's aced, right ?

45:19.301 --> 45:21.513
You always did cut
them corners, didn't you ?

45:27.171 --> 45:29.224
Seems like you cut a few
yourself, Major.

45:33.313 --> 45:35.256
However it ends,
you're good police.

45:35.598 --> 45:37.159
I just did what I did.

45:38.996 --> 45:39.941
It felt right.

45:42.776 --> 45:43.790
I'm fine with that.

46:27.342 --> 46:28.821
I don't understand.

46:32.032 --> 46:33.027
Drink your wine.

46:39.854 --> 46:40.877
You and me in public.

46:43.031 --> 46:45.253
- But your wife.
- She wins without me.

46:48.962 --> 46:52.145
On the Mayor's ticket, she wins.

46:52.206 --> 46:53.368
And you make major ?

46:56.334 --> 46:58.964
I think she was waiting for this day
more than I ever was.

47:01.183 --> 47:02.453
And now she's not here.

47:04.067 --> 47:04.653
No.

47:06.396 --> 47:07.166
She's not.

47:15.031 --> 47:16.389
From out of nowhere, huh ?

47:17.767 --> 47:18.765
Nowhere is right.

47:20.960 --> 47:21.739
Why me ?

47:24.040 --> 47:25.524
I guess you don't live right.

47:31.147 --> 47:33.503
- Kari, what was that ?
- Nothing.

47:33.534 --> 47:35.075
- What broke ?
- Nothing, Mama.

47:42.073 --> 47:43.011
So...

47:43.807 --> 47:44.634
Yeah.

47:45.884 --> 47:47.715
You just drive over here.

47:48.280 --> 47:48.963
I did.

47:50.539 --> 47:53.021
Why tonight ? What happened ?

47:56.060 --> 47:58.407
I was in my old district tonight

47:58.427 --> 48:00.840
which is where I used
to feel pretty good, I think.

48:01.761 --> 48:03.658
I wasn't so angry
when I was there anyway.

48:05.351 --> 48:07.511
I don't know, someone said
something, I guess

48:09.513 --> 48:10.863
and, uhit doesn't make sense.

48:14.542 --> 48:15.942
I guess I finished something today.

48:16.772 --> 48:17.475
A case ?

48:18.800 --> 48:19.644
More than that.

48:21.893 --> 48:23.660
It's like everything
I poured into a glass

48:23.764 --> 48:25.275
came out the bottom

48:25.936 --> 48:28.100
and I just kept on pouring.

48:28.451 --> 48:30.431
Like the thing had
a hole in it, you know.

48:32.030 --> 48:33.745
Things that make me right
for this job

48:33.746 --> 48:35.772
maybe they're the same things
that make me wrong

48:35.790 --> 48:37.339
for everything else.

48:38.898 --> 48:40.794
Do you want to come inside
for a drink ?

48:45.150 --> 48:45.912
Not tonight.

48:49.792 --> 48:51.655
But if it's not too late,
I wouldn't mind

48:52.037 --> 48:52.887
meeting your kids.

49:52.007 --> 49:55.135
Major Colvin misled his officers.

49:55.181 --> 49:58.943
They thought that his initiative
was a tactical deployment

49:59.191 --> 50:01.304
to entrap narcotics traffickers.

50:01.664 --> 50:04.068
There was no mention whatsoever

50:04.123 --> 50:06.796
of the initiative to
any superior officer.

50:06.836 --> 50:09.691
And for five weeks, all evidence

50:09.692 --> 50:12.685
of what he was doing managed to elude
the entire command staff.

50:14.109 --> 50:15.476
Are you kidding, Commissioner ?

50:15.504 --> 50:16.988
I take full responsibility

50:17.308 --> 50:20.157
and indeed, after I first learned
of the matter

50:20.316 --> 50:22.326
I informed the Mayor, and together

50:22.385 --> 50:23.785
we moved immediately

50:23.881 --> 50:26.873
to relieve Major Colvin

50:26.998 --> 50:28.506
I'm under the impression that

50:28.507 --> 50:30.729
this administration
gave serious consideration

50:30.742 --> 50:32.319
with Colvin's initiative.

50:32.366 --> 50:33.495
No, sir.

50:33.503 --> 50:36.097
Major Colvin informed you of his effort
at a COMSTAT meeting

50:36.193 --> 50:37.434
more than a week ago.

50:37.442 --> 50:39.678
His free zones stayed up
for six days after that.

50:39.741 --> 50:42.304
That's my responsibility, Councilman.

50:42.359 --> 50:44.652
We needed the time to conclude
an ongoing investigation

50:44.670 --> 50:46.843
by the Major Crime Unit,
a wiretap case

50:46.844 --> 50:48.844
that would have been disrupted

50:48.853 --> 50:51.956
Correct, Mayor Royce was aware
of the pending case

50:52.012 --> 50:55.194
and allowed us to delay
our response accordingly.

50:55.249 --> 50:57.478
But the Mayor was unequivocal

50:57.692 --> 51:00.637
in his opposition
to what Major Colvin did.

51:00.835 --> 51:03.497
What we have here, I'm afraid,
is nothing more complicated

51:03.498 --> 51:06.556
than a solitary police commander
who, under great pressure

51:06.574 --> 51:10.920
proved to be amoral, incompetent,
and unfit for command.

51:11.373 --> 51:12.058
No.

51:13.752 --> 51:14.850
It's about more than that.

51:14.905 --> 51:17.421
This is more important
than who knew what when

51:17.627 --> 51:19.442
or who falls on his sword

51:19.546 --> 51:21.709
or whether someone
can use this disaster

51:21.734 --> 51:23.484
to make a political point or two.

51:23.531 --> 51:24.423
Mr. Chairman--

51:24.494 --> 51:27.343
We can forgive Major Colvin who,
out of his frustration

51:27.510 --> 51:29.924
and despair, found himself
condoning something which

51:29.925 --> 51:33.422
can't possibly be condoned.
We can do that much.

51:34.536 --> 51:37.417
But, gentlemen, what we can't forgive,

51:37.576 --> 51:40.237
what I can't forgive ever

51:41.260 --> 51:42.454
is how we...

51:44.729 --> 51:47.637
you, me, this administration,
all of us

51:48.860 --> 51:52.646
how we turned away from those streets
in West Baltimore. The poor, the sick

51:52.895 --> 51:56.404
the swollen underclass of our city
trapped in the wreckage of neighborhoods

51:56.435 --> 51:59.189
which were once so prized.
Communities which

51:59.522 --> 52:02.228
we've failed to defend,
which we have surrendered

52:02.253 --> 52:04.433
to the horrors of the drug trade.

52:04.575 --> 52:07.631
And if this disaster demands anything
of us as a city

52:07.973 --> 52:09.788
it demands that we say enough.

52:09.796 --> 52:12.772
Enough to the despair which makes
policemen even think about surrender.

52:12.780 --> 52:15.214
Enough to the fact that
these neighborhoods are not saved

52:15.334 --> 52:18.723
or are beyond the saving.
Enough to this administration's

52:18.779 --> 52:21.016
indecisiveness and lethargy

52:21.387 --> 52:23.546
to the garbage
which goes uncollected

52:23.594 --> 52:25.997
the lots and row houses
which stay vacant

52:26.165 --> 52:28.281
the addicts who go untreated

52:28.306 --> 52:30.052
the working men and women
who every day

52:30.053 --> 52:31.886
are denied a chance
at economic freedom.

52:34.715 --> 52:36.475
Enough to the crime,
which every day

52:36.476 --> 52:38.954
chokes more and more
of the life from our city.

52:40.825 --> 52:41.670
And...

52:42.562 --> 52:46.063
the thing of it is, if we don't
take responsibility and step up

52:46.113 --> 52:48.449
not just for the mistakes
and the miscues

52:48.639 --> 52:51.506
but for whether or not we're gonna
win this battle for our streets

52:51.534 --> 52:52.537
if that doesn't happen

52:52.771 --> 52:55.973
we're gonna lose these neighborhoods
and ultimately this city forever.

52:56.011 --> 52:57.854
If we don't have the courage

52:57.878 --> 53:00.914
and the conviction to fight this war
they way it should be fought

53:00.915 --> 53:03.473
the way it needs to be fought,
using every weapon

53:03.489 --> 53:06.497
that we can possibly muster,
if that doesn't happen

53:08.549 --> 53:10.127
well, then we're staring at defeat.

53:12.925 --> 53:14.884
And that defeat
should not and cannot

53:14.979 --> 53:16.913
and will not be forgiven.

53:25.192 --> 53:26.254
It was a good case

53:26.891 --> 53:27.962
I'm not denying that

53:28.959 --> 53:30.582
but I need to trust my people.

53:31.578 --> 53:34.235
Unless you can give
your word, there's no way--

53:34.435 --> 53:36.519
That's more than fair.

53:36.997 --> 53:38.542
Thanks.

53:39.010 --> 53:41.525
But it's better for me
if I do something else.

53:45.695 --> 53:47.318
Detective.

53:49.925 --> 53:51.107
It's not you, it's me.

53:53.286 --> 53:55.695
- But where--
- The western, I think.

53:56.957 --> 53:59.384
Western feels like home.

54:13.738 --> 54:15.894
You showed something today.

54:16.231 --> 54:18.063
Just felt like it needed to be said.

54:21.434 --> 54:23.388
Sounds like you're
running for something.

54:27.378 --> 54:28.167
Eunetta.

54:29.227 --> 54:29.941
Been a while.

54:45.239 --> 54:46.646
Thought y'all was in training.

55:02.534 --> 55:05.041
So what time you want us to be
there tomorrow, coach ?

55:06.400 --> 55:07.607
3:30 would be good.

55:08.396 --> 55:10.405
- Hope to see you all then.
- A'right.

55:27.347 --> 55:29.265
What the fuck y'all
standing around for ?

55:30.059 --> 55:31.049
Man, get to work.

56:35.584 --> 56:37.135
That's a seed.

56:38.803 --> 56:39.525
Yeah.

59:59.050 --> 01:00:00.608
What do you see right here?

01:00:01.268 --> 01:00:03.688
It's bulk metal. 10¢ a pound.

01:00:04.080 --> 01:00:04.493
Here.

01:00:05.294 --> 01:00:06.246
Aluminum.

01:00:06.393 --> 01:00:08.732
Right you are. 30¢ a pound

01:00:09.440 --> 01:00:11.302
no problem.

01:00:12.217 --> 01:00:15.878
in these modern times a man
gotta keep one eye on the ground

01:00:15.996 --> 01:00:17.843
pick up what he find, feel me ?

01:00:18.567 --> 01:00:20.731
There's money to be made
if you know where to look.

01:00:22.457 --> 01:00:25.126
I hope you listenin','cause
I'm tryin'to school you here.

01:00:26.514 --> 01:00:28.324
Yeah, you don't want to know.

01:00:28.325 --> 01:00:30.560
You see, You think you brown,
but you still green.

01:00:39.127 --> 01:00:39.961
How ya doin'?

01:00:45.900 --> 01:00:46.956
That's somethin', huh ?

01:00:47.497 --> 01:00:50.410
It's like they took a big
eraserand rubbed across it.

01:00:51.971 --> 01:00:52.476
Yaeh !

01:00:55.668 --> 01:00:58.182
Yeah, but before a dope
fiend come down here

01:00:58.417 --> 01:01:01.976
cop a little somethin',
ain't nary a soul hassle him.

01:01:02.681 --> 01:01:05.488
Hoppers and police,
they just let him be.

01:01:09.732 --> 01:01:11.096
Was a good thing, huh ?

01:01:15.306 --> 01:01:16.581
I'm just sayin'.

01:01:17.826 --> 01:01:20.211
You probly don't know,
but it's rough out there, baby.

01:01:20.671 --> 01:01:24.321
Cops be back bangin'on you.
Hoppers be messin' with you.

01:01:28.648 --> 01:01:29.502
Thank you.

01:01:30.969 --> 01:01:31.614
Aw, shit.

01:01:32.214 --> 01:01:33.948
That's a dime here.
That's a seed.

01:01:36.459 --> 01:01:37.057
Come on, boy.
