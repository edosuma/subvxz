[distorted static]

01:22.702 --> 01:24.668
- [Desmond] We're doing this?

01:24.668 --> 01:25.626
- [Clive] Are you serious?

01:25.626 --> 01:27.097
We've been through it many times.

01:27.097 --> 01:27.930
- [Desmond] I'm nervous.

01:27.930 --> 01:29.854
You know, first time and all.

01:29.854 --> 01:30.762
- [Clive] Just fucking-

01:30.762 --> 01:31.720
Shh.

01:31.720 --> 01:33.045
Trying to figure out what to say to him.

01:33.045 --> 01:33.878
- [Desmond] Okay.

01:33.878 --> 01:35.669
- What?
[Desmond shouting]

01:35.669 --> 01:38.350
- [Doug] What the hell is going on?

01:38.350 --> 01:39.870
What?

01:39.870 --> 01:41.710
Jesus Christ.

01:41.710 --> 01:42.700
Who tied me to this chair?

01:42.700 --> 01:43.533
- We tied you.

01:43.533 --> 01:44.366
Doug, we tied you to the chair.

01:44.366 --> 01:45.313
It's fine.

01:45.313 --> 01:47.370
- Is this some sort of weird prank?

01:47.370 --> 01:48.673
- Um, kind of.

01:49.870 --> 01:50.703
- Is this a-

01:50.703 --> 01:52.050
Is there a joke I'm missing?

01:52.050 --> 01:52.883
- No.

01:52.883 --> 01:54.570
- I, um. [sighs]

01:54.570 --> 01:56.350
This is awkward.

01:56.350 --> 01:57.183
- Why?

01:57.183 --> 01:59.780
- Look, honestly, we thought
you were gonna stay unconscious

01:59.780 --> 02:01.250
for way longer.

02:01.250 --> 02:02.330
- What for?

02:02.330 --> 02:05.730
And what's with the
weird Tom Cruise robes?

02:05.730 --> 02:07.233
- Look, we're here to murder you.

02:08.743 --> 02:09.576
[crickets chirping]

02:09.576 --> 02:11.816
[laughing loudly]

02:11.816 --> 02:12.649
- Bullies.

02:14.149 --> 02:15.540
It's just a joke, right?

02:15.540 --> 02:18.870
- Well, actually, yeah we are actually,

02:18.870 --> 02:20.886
legitimately, here to really murder you.

02:20.886 --> 02:21.903
- And Taylor.

02:23.040 --> 02:23.873
- What?

02:23.873 --> 02:24.845
- [Both] Yeah.

02:24.845 --> 02:25.678
- What?

02:25.678 --> 02:28.510
- Well, look, it's a
long story, to be honest.

02:28.510 --> 02:29.620
- Well, I'm a captive audience.

02:29.620 --> 02:30.453
- Sure.

02:30.453 --> 02:31.286
And I don't wanna tell you.

02:31.286 --> 02:33.043
Um, so.

02:34.636 --> 02:35.760
- Right.

02:35.760 --> 02:39.480
Least you can tell me if you
guys murdered anybody else?

02:39.480 --> 02:40.313
- No.

02:41.890 --> 02:45.410
- So, I'd be the first
person in this long story?

02:45.410 --> 02:47.140
- Yes.
- Mm hm.

02:47.140 --> 02:49.320
- You do realize you'd be

02:49.320 --> 02:51.760
murdering a black guy first, right?

02:51.760 --> 02:52.970
- God, no.

02:52.970 --> 02:54.120
What?

02:54.120 --> 02:57.290
- This is, like, the oldest
stereotype in the book.

02:57.290 --> 02:58.151
- Stereotype?

02:58.151 --> 02:58.984
That's not-

02:58.984 --> 02:59.817
What writing?

02:59.817 --> 03:01.107
- I've known you guys for a while now

03:01.107 --> 03:02.850
and you're both fucking racists.

03:02.850 --> 03:04.202
- Go get fucked, we are.

03:04.202 --> 03:05.310
- Whoa, whoa, hey.

03:05.310 --> 03:06.544
Ah, that's incorrect, sir.
- Fucking racists.

03:06.544 --> 03:07.753
- We are not.
- That's assumption.

03:07.753 --> 03:08.907
- We are not racists.

03:08.907 --> 03:11.912
- Yes, but you're murdering
the black guy first, right?

03:11.912 --> 03:13.120
[both sputtering]

03:13.120 --> 03:13.953
- [Clive] No, what?

03:13.953 --> 03:16.850
You're confused because
actually there's a, uh, a plan.

03:16.850 --> 03:17.920
- [Desmond] That there
is 13 steps in the plan.

03:17.920 --> 03:18.753
- Yes.

03:18.753 --> 03:20.040
And the plan is racist.

03:20.040 --> 03:20.919
- [Clive] What the fuck?

03:20.919 --> 03:21.752
No.

03:21.752 --> 03:22.585
- [Desmond] You're talking-

03:22.585 --> 03:23.418
No, no.

03:23.418 --> 03:24.251
This is not a race thing.

03:24.251 --> 03:25.084
- [Clive] Yeah, black lives matter, idiot.

03:25.084 --> 03:25.970
- [Desmond] And.

03:25.970 --> 03:27.678
You've got a white girlfriend
so I don't even know

03:27.678 --> 03:30.236
what you're talking about.

03:30.236 --> 03:31.069
- Well, you're not really a making

03:31.069 --> 03:31.920
a good case for yourselves.

03:31.920 --> 03:33.372
- [Clive] It's the plan.

03:33.372 --> 03:34.204
Huh?

03:34.204 --> 03:35.630
- You do know what
racists always say, right?

03:35.630 --> 03:36.463
- [Clive] Oh, I dunno.

03:36.463 --> 03:38.300
What do racists always say, huh?

03:38.300 --> 03:39.550
- That it's.

03:39.550 --> 03:40.440
That they're not racist.

03:40.440 --> 03:41.273
- [Clive] Sure.

03:41.273 --> 03:42.257
We can't fucking win, can we?

03:42.257 --> 03:43.090
- [Desmond] Well, what
does that give us then?

03:43.090 --> 03:44.210
I don't.

03:44.210 --> 03:46.009
- Sorry to be an inconvenience for you.

03:46.009 --> 03:46.841
You know.

03:46.841 --> 03:47.675
My colonizers here.

03:47.675 --> 03:48.508
- [Clive] Oh come on.

03:48.508 --> 03:49.341
Colonize- What?

03:49.341 --> 03:50.174
That is racial.

03:50.174 --> 03:51.655
- [Desmond] You've crossed a line.

03:51.655 --> 03:52.607
My nads hurt.

03:52.607 --> 03:55.650
- My Hispanic grandmother was,
is, was not even on the boat.

03:55.650 --> 03:56.483
So.

03:56.483 --> 03:57.529
- [Desmond] And it's not even
relevant to this situation.

03:57.529 --> 03:58.362
- [Clive] No, no. Not relevant at all.

03:58.362 --> 03:59.195
- You white demons.

03:59.195 --> 04:00.350
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

04:00.350 --> 04:01.960
- Put me, trapped me here.

04:01.960 --> 04:02.870
Tied me down.
- Racist now.

04:02.870 --> 04:03.703
Tellin' you what.

04:03.703 --> 04:04.690
- Now you're tryin' to
kill me and my girlfriend.

04:04.690 --> 04:05.677
- You know what, I've got things to do.

04:05.677 --> 04:06.510
- And that fact-
- So, actually if you'd just-

04:06.510 --> 04:09.010
[man screams]

04:12.741 --> 04:13.583
- [Desmond] Are we racist?

04:13.583 --> 04:16.277
- Fuckin' get his keys and go inside.

[upbeat electronic music]

07:55.905 --> 07:59.322
[melancholy synth music]

08:16.097 --> 08:17.793
- I'm seriously still trying to work out

08:17.793 --> 08:19.021
how this has happened.

08:19.021 --> 08:20.861
- Hey, don't.

08:20.861 --> 08:21.694
- But someone's doing this.

08:21.694 --> 08:23.262
Someone planned this.

08:23.262 --> 08:24.350
When this kind of stuff happens,

08:24.350 --> 08:27.043
it's usually spousal or drug-related.

08:28.040 --> 08:29.904
That's not what this was.

08:29.904 --> 08:31.062
- I know.

08:31.062 --> 08:32.746
But, maybe it's not time to talk about it.

08:32.746 --> 08:34.820
- Yeah, but then when else?

08:34.820 --> 08:35.909
Someone did it right.

08:35.909 --> 08:37.980
So why wait until the trail gets cold?

08:41.192 --> 08:44.275
[footsteps plodding]

08:49.418 --> 08:51.947
[heels clicking]

08:51.947 --> 08:53.280
- How you doing?

08:54.677 --> 08:56.453
This is all nuts, right?

08:56.453 --> 08:57.286
- Mm.

08:58.381 --> 08:59.214
Nuts.

09:01.992 --> 09:05.698
- Yeah, I'll, uh, leave
you to your thoughts.

09:05.698 --> 09:08.448
[heels clicking]

09:14.779 --> 09:16.696
- Brenda's fuckin' cat.

09:52.778 --> 09:55.445
[heels tapping]

09:56.861 --> 09:57.998
- How you doin'?

09:57.998 --> 09:59.158
- I'm fine.

09:59.158 --> 10:00.853
I mean, you know, everything.

10:00.853 --> 10:01.686
- Yeah.

10:01.686 --> 10:02.519
Yeah.

10:02.519 --> 10:04.093
- You?

10:04.093 --> 10:05.454
- I don't know what to think.

10:05.454 --> 10:06.287
- Mm.

10:07.723 --> 10:10.243
- How does something like this happen?

10:10.243 --> 10:11.181
- A psycho.

10:11.181 --> 10:13.917
- Yeah, maybe it was psychos.

10:13.917 --> 10:16.000
- I just said one psycho.

10:18.344 --> 10:20.060
- The police just aren't doing anything.

10:20.060 --> 10:21.110
It's been nearly a week.

10:21.110 --> 10:23.300
Why haven't they brought anyone in?

10:23.300 --> 10:24.920
- Hey these things.

10:24.920 --> 10:26.340
They don't get solved over night.

10:26.340 --> 10:27.173
They take time.

10:27.173 --> 10:28.710
Like months, years.

10:28.710 --> 10:30.080
- How long is it gonna take?

10:30.080 --> 10:32.290
Just analyze some shit
and find the fuckers.

10:32.290 --> 10:33.142
- Yeah find 'em.

10:33.142 --> 10:35.070
- Unless it's like a domestic situation

10:35.070 --> 10:36.140
where the killer's the husband,

10:36.140 --> 10:37.577
I don't think it's that easy.

10:37.577 --> 10:38.410
You know?

10:38.410 --> 10:40.401
Or, if it's like drug dealers,
then that could take years.

10:40.401 --> 10:42.050
- I don't think they're drug dealers.

10:42.050 --> 10:43.570
- No, this is a full on murder.

10:43.570 --> 10:46.196
They, like, tied him to
a chair and stabbed him.

10:46.196 --> 10:47.731
And then they hunted her in her house.

10:47.731 --> 10:49.820
This isn't an argument gone wrong.

10:49.820 --> 10:50.911
- Um, yeah.

10:50.911 --> 10:53.211
I'm not trying to start
an argument, I'm just.

10:54.240 --> 10:56.523
I'm saying, it isn't simple.

10:56.523 --> 10:57.872
You know, clearly this is fucked, so,

10:57.872 --> 10:59.828
it's not someone that they know.

10:59.828 --> 11:01.258
- Knew.

11:01.258 --> 11:02.091
- What?

11:02.091 --> 11:03.888
- You said know.

11:03.888 --> 11:04.810
- Oh, whatever.

11:04.810 --> 11:07.600
Look, the cops are probably
doing some CSI shit right now.

11:07.600 --> 11:08.780
Right? You know.

11:08.780 --> 11:10.170
Analyzing and enhancing and-

11:10.170 --> 11:12.610
And they're all probably
top people in their field.

11:12.610 --> 11:16.574
Otherwise, they would
be in our fields, right?

11:16.574 --> 11:17.407
- Yeah, Clive's right.

11:17.407 --> 11:18.391
- Right.

11:18.391 --> 11:20.541
- [sighing] I just don't want
it to go on forever, you know?

11:20.541 --> 11:22.152
You hear about these
cases that go unsolved

11:22.152 --> 11:25.013
and I don't want that for them.

11:25.013 --> 11:27.013
They deserve an answer.

11:27.013 --> 11:27.846
Justice.

11:27.846 --> 11:29.710
- Yeah, they'll get it.

11:29.710 --> 11:31.960
We just have to be patient.

11:38.957 --> 11:41.207
[grunting]

11:45.060 --> 11:47.110
- Isn't this a little weird?

11:47.110 --> 11:47.943
- It's fine.

11:49.280 --> 11:50.193
- We're at a wake.

11:51.050 --> 11:52.370
- Well, you know what they say,

11:52.370 --> 11:55.850
funerals are aphrodisiacs and all.

11:55.850 --> 11:56.683
- They say that?

11:57.830 --> 11:59.227
- Yeah, sure, whatever.

12:00.186 --> 12:02.436
[grunting]

12:04.010 --> 12:06.765
- Have you ever thought about us?

12:06.765 --> 12:08.245
- Huh?

12:08.245 --> 12:09.078
- I don't know.

12:09.078 --> 12:10.763
We've been doing this for a long time.

12:11.660 --> 12:12.630
- We only just started.

12:12.630 --> 12:14.440
- No, not this.

12:14.440 --> 12:16.030
You and me.

12:16.030 --> 12:16.863
- Oh.

12:18.690 --> 12:19.994
- Why don't we make it public?

12:19.994 --> 12:20.980
[scoffing]

12:20.980 --> 12:21.813
- Not this.

12:21.813 --> 12:22.710
Just.

12:22.710 --> 12:24.673
Why are we always so secretive?

12:25.669 --> 12:26.502
- Look, I just.

12:26.502 --> 12:28.160
- Are you ashamed of being gay?

12:28.160 --> 12:29.190
- No.

12:29.190 --> 12:32.590
- Weird parents or somethin' like that?

12:32.590 --> 12:34.100
- Is this really the best time that

12:34.100 --> 12:34.933
we could be talking about this?

12:34.933 --> 12:36.040
- Oh when else are we gonna talk about it?

12:36.040 --> 12:37.858
It's the only time we're
ever alone together.

12:37.858 --> 12:39.220
[grunting]

12:39.220 --> 12:40.140
I just.

12:40.140 --> 12:42.310
I wanna know that I'm more
than just this to you.

12:42.310 --> 12:45.600
I mean, if we're gonna be
together, we should be together.

12:45.600 --> 12:46.668
- Look, I just.

12:46.668 --> 12:49.001
[cries out]

12:51.968 --> 12:52.801
Oh.

12:53.812 --> 12:54.645
Fuck.

12:54.645 --> 12:56.241
[phone buzzing]

12:56.241 --> 12:58.908
[groans loudly]

13:01.404 --> 13:02.237
- What are you?

13:02.237 --> 13:03.529
Are you gonna?

13:03.529 --> 13:05.769
- Sorry, but I, I gotta go.

13:05.769 --> 13:06.769
- Of course.

13:12.842 --> 13:14.907
[footsteps plodding]

13:14.907 --> 13:15.740
- You rang?

13:16.790 --> 13:19.033
- Well, Brenda has some ideas.

13:21.160 --> 13:21.993
- What about?

13:23.460 --> 13:26.522
- Well, they must be planning
to strike again, right?

13:26.522 --> 13:27.625
- What do you mean?

13:27.625 --> 13:28.640
- Whoever did this clearly had a reason.

13:28.640 --> 13:30.967
You don't just randomly
kill two people like that

13:30.967 --> 13:32.950
unless you have a plan.

13:32.950 --> 13:34.241
- Well.

13:34.241 --> 13:35.940
- That feels a little alarmist.

13:35.940 --> 13:37.090
- It wasn't random.

13:37.090 --> 13:38.540
It was planned.

13:38.540 --> 13:39.850
They definitely had a reason.

13:39.850 --> 13:42.730
And they're, probably,
planning something else.

13:42.730 --> 13:43.650
- Why would you say that?

13:43.650 --> 13:45.294
That's awful.

The fuck does that even mean?

14:07.860 --> 14:10.310
Hey, uh, don't mean to be rude, but,

14:10.310 --> 14:12.160
I've got this space for another hour.

14:13.650 --> 14:14.483
You still there?

14:17.660 --> 14:18.493

15:30.167 --> 15:31.950
- Man, look how much hair got caught

15:31.950 --> 15:34.446
on the double-sided tape.

15:34.446 --> 15:35.696
- Don't, don't.

15:36.681 --> 15:37.514
- What?

15:37.514 --> 15:38.863
- Don't leave it here.

15:40.120 --> 15:41.580
- Why?

15:41.580 --> 15:42.883
- 'Cause it's your DNA.

15:44.080 --> 15:44.913
- Right.

15:46.470 --> 15:48.770
Maybe we should get,
like, some of Tom's DNA?

15:48.770 --> 15:49.670
Leave that around?

15:52.274 --> 15:53.107
Hmm.

15:56.920 --> 15:59.651
What kind of a killer do you think Tom is?

15:59.651 --> 16:00.513
- What d'you mean?

16:01.496 --> 16:03.683
- Like, would he be art-y?

16:05.030 --> 16:05.863
- Art-y?

16:05.863 --> 16:07.175
- Hm.

16:07.175 --> 16:09.841
Like, should we leave a word or something?

16:09.841 --> 16:10.674
- Oh.

16:10.674 --> 16:12.643
Spell out Satan in intestines.

16:14.070 --> 16:15.373
- Yeah, but backwards.

16:17.100 --> 16:17.933
Yeah.

16:17.933 --> 16:19.390
Natas.

16:19.390 --> 16:22.160
Then they could do it,
like, the mirror thing where

16:22.160 --> 16:24.660
they hold the mirror up and it spells it.

16:24.660 --> 16:26.483
- We could leave, like, a symbol.

16:27.500 --> 16:28.383
- Like drums?

16:33.134 --> 16:35.356
- No.

16:35.356 --> 16:39.050
I've got it.

16:39.050 --> 16:41.050
You made it too long here.

16:41.890 --> 16:43.977
You have to go straight and
then the bell end at the end.

16:48.479 --> 16:49.312
It's too long.

16:49.312 --> 16:50.145
- What do you mean?

16:50.145 --> 16:51.527
- I mean, it needs to be shorter.

16:51.527 --> 16:52.770
- You could be helping.

16:52.770 --> 16:54.460
- I'm helping by telling you how to do-

16:54.460 --> 16:56.251
If I wasn't doing this,
you'd be fucking it up.

16:56.251 --> 16:57.965
I mean, you are fucking it up.

16:57.965 --> 16:59.556
- So, I need to make it shorter then.

16:59.556 --> 17:00.389
- Mm.

17:03.461 --> 17:05.794
[muttering]

17:08.310 --> 17:09.844
- Is this too short then?

17:09.844 --> 17:10.676
- Hold on, it's-

17:10.676 --> 17:11.510
- What are we going for here?

17:11.510 --> 17:12.676
Long or short?

17:13.523 --> 17:16.010
- We're just going for a...

17:16.010 --> 17:18.300
- Look, I can make balls.

17:18.300 --> 17:21.308
But then, I've gotta make,
like, one bigger than the other.

17:21.308 --> 17:23.290
And then, what, what is this?

17:24.353 --> 17:27.190
Is it just gonna be, like,
a concave sort of a thing?

17:27.190 --> 17:28.860
- Yeah, I guess, it's just a bit of a-

17:28.860 --> 17:29.693
- That's not.

17:29.693 --> 17:30.526
[sighs]

17:30.526 --> 17:31.359
It's not gonna read.

17:31.359 --> 17:32.380
- One ball bigger than
the other's fine, though.

17:32.380 --> 17:33.520
I mean, that's, that's real.

17:33.520 --> 17:34.908
- That's, that's, yes.

17:34.908 --> 17:37.942
We're gonna do this, let's
do it properly, you know?

just stick to normal murder.

[water running]
[pots banging]

18:40.198 --> 18:41.386
- Got an idea.

18:41.386 --> 18:42.219
- Mm?

18:43.245 --> 18:45.717
- We should make a Facebook group.

18:45.717 --> 18:47.280
- Why?

18:47.280 --> 18:50.693
- Well, because, everyone
would be really afraid now.

18:52.113 --> 18:54.060
- Oh because of the murders.

18:54.060 --> 18:56.386
- And no one'll wanna walk home alone.

18:56.386 --> 18:57.219
- Mm hm.

18:58.589 --> 19:01.369
- And if we make it,
they won't suspect us.

19:01.369 --> 19:03.119
- Suspect us of what?

19:04.677 --> 19:05.844
- The murders.

19:06.890 --> 19:08.057
- Right, yeah.

19:09.458 --> 19:10.291
Cool.

19:12.541 --> 19:14.124
What do we call it?

19:15.791 --> 19:16.624
- Um.

19:19.720 --> 19:20.553
- Walker.

19:21.574 --> 19:22.824
- Texas ranger.

19:25.640 --> 19:26.473
- Um.

19:28.400 --> 19:29.933
Safe Uber.

19:32.522 --> 19:33.355
- Homecoming.

19:33.355 --> 19:35.280
Is it working?

19:35.280 --> 19:36.113
- No.

19:37.035 --> 19:38.202
Homer Safeson?

19:41.060 --> 19:42.143
- Walkin' pals.

19:43.110 --> 19:43.943
- Um.

19:43.943 --> 19:44.863
Edge of homorrow.

19:47.337 --> 19:48.170
- The strollers.

19:49.555 --> 19:51.500
- Homo erectus?

19:51.500 --> 19:53.740
- No, I think we're not
actually getting anywhere here.

19:53.740 --> 19:55.070
- Right.

19:55.070 --> 19:55.919
- Oh, hey.

19:55.919 --> 19:57.420
- No, we don't need anymore suggestions.

19:57.420 --> 19:58.963
- No, it wasn't that, but.

20:00.760 --> 20:02.493
Shouldn't we be taunting Lauren?

20:04.970 --> 20:06.234
- How does homo erectus
make you think of that?

20:06.234 --> 20:07.230
- I work fast.

20:07.230 --> 20:08.063
Just keep up.

20:08.063 --> 20:09.030
Come on, stay on point.

20:09.030 --> 20:11.000
Shouldn't we be taunting Lauren?

20:11.000 --> 20:12.091
- Why?

20:12.091 --> 20:12.924
- Well, think about it.

20:12.924 --> 20:15.000
I mean, in all the... films.

20:15.000 --> 20:17.022
That's what the murderers do.

20:17.022 --> 20:20.880
They turn it all into a big
game and get into their heads.

20:20.880 --> 20:23.410
And make them choose the next victim.

20:23.410 --> 20:27.605
Shouldn't we do that?

20:27.605 --> 20:28.855
Think about it.

20:29.840 --> 20:33.420
I mean if Tom is the one
who's doing all of this, then,

20:33.420 --> 20:34.253
why?

20:35.383 --> 20:36.290
- Why what?

20:36.290 --> 20:38.813
- Why is he doing all of the murders?

20:41.295 --> 20:45.620
- Well, um.

20:45.620 --> 20:46.453
Because...

20:47.703 --> 20:50.350
[dog barking]

20:50.350 --> 20:51.933
Because he wants...

20:53.863 --> 20:55.944
Fuck, I don't know.

20:55.944 --> 20:56.990
- Well.

20:56.990 --> 20:58.400
Maybe he's...

20:59.280 --> 21:02.480
Secretly gay, um, and has

21:03.520 --> 21:05.570
feelings, unrequited perhaps,

21:05.570 --> 21:07.570
for his best friend, say.

21:07.570 --> 21:10.450
And the frustration of all
that is causing him to lash out

21:10.450 --> 21:12.763
and commit murders.

21:15.470 --> 21:17.333
- I don't know that is very plausible.

21:17.333 --> 21:18.865
- It's not likely, is it?

21:18.865 --> 21:20.948
[laughs]

21:22.517 --> 21:26.170
But then, maybe, like, the
confusion that he could be

21:26.170 --> 21:29.130
feeling, um, about these feelings-

21:29.130 --> 21:29.963
- Is this still the gay thing?
- Which have been there

21:29.963 --> 21:30.880
a long time.

21:30.880 --> 21:32.810
He might not be comfortable
with that as a label.

21:32.810 --> 21:34.070
But, it's still.

21:34.070 --> 21:35.157
- Maybe he's a cunt.

21:36.821 --> 21:38.530
- Like...

21:38.530 --> 21:39.500
- Like, a cunt.

21:40.800 --> 21:42.931
Like, in school, he was a bully.

21:42.931 --> 21:44.080
Like a real shit head.

21:44.080 --> 21:46.650
And then he knows how to
be all charming and suave

21:46.650 --> 21:47.483
to the chicks.

21:48.430 --> 21:50.403
But that inner bully,

21:51.440 --> 21:52.735
cunt

21:52.735 --> 21:53.913
- edness is still there.

21:53.913 --> 21:55.493
- All right, I'm following.

21:56.680 --> 21:58.430
And being triggered.

21:58.430 --> 21:59.263
- Exactly.

21:59.263 --> 22:01.830
So, because he's repressing
this cunt-edness,

22:01.830 --> 22:03.613
it's coming out in behavior.

22:04.930 --> 22:06.210
Like murders.

22:06.210 --> 22:07.600
- Right.

22:07.600 --> 22:09.370
That makes sense.

22:09.370 --> 22:10.546
Because he's a cunt.

22:10.546 --> 22:11.690
- 'Cause he's a cunt.

22:11.690 --> 22:13.525
- Just a secret...

22:13.525 --> 22:14.358
cunt.

22:14.358 --> 22:16.525
- He's just a secret cunt.

22:18.226 --> 22:20.050
Why're you naked?

[crickets chirping]

[Clive sobbing]

26:12.309 --> 26:15.471
[melancholy synth music]

26:15.471 --> 26:18.170
- There's almost two
million people in the city.

26:18.170 --> 26:19.980
And three people from our friend group

26:19.980 --> 26:22.350
get killed in, like, a month.

26:22.350 --> 26:23.284
That isn't a coincidence.

26:23.284 --> 26:24.420
- Lauren.

26:24.420 --> 26:25.690
- No, I still think this is planned.

26:25.690 --> 26:26.980
It isn't random.

26:26.980 --> 26:27.900
- Not always.

26:27.900 --> 26:29.350
Not all killers need reasons.

26:32.600 --> 26:34.960
- Doug, Taylor, and Sarah.

26:34.960 --> 26:36.773
Maybe someone from our old class?

26:37.924 --> 26:39.662
- Yeah, but who do you think
we went to school with?

26:39.662 --> 26:42.560
No, there were no Bernies
in our English units.

26:42.560 --> 26:43.730
- You never know.

26:43.730 --> 26:46.680
People can get caught up
in some weird emotions.

26:46.680 --> 26:49.220
- Psychopaths don't feel emotions.

26:49.220 --> 26:52.370
- Maybe someone who felt
overlooked and powerless.

26:52.370 --> 26:53.403
Maybe they still do.

26:54.988 --> 26:57.460
- You're still saying this is deliberate?

26:57.460 --> 27:01.440
- Uh, seven stab wounds in
each victim so far, on average.

27:01.440 --> 27:02.800
That's so deliberate.

27:02.800 --> 27:04.880
Sloppy, but they meant to do it.

27:04.880 --> 27:05.713
- So far?

27:05.713 --> 27:07.188
- Sloppy?

27:07.188 --> 27:09.540
- I think I'm gonna see what
I can find on our old class.

27:09.540 --> 27:11.629
Maybe we missed something back then.

27:11.629 --> 27:13.150
- Or someone.

27:13.150 --> 27:16.010
- Yeah, or, maybe, there
wasn't, like, a neighborhood

27:16.010 --> 27:17.943
psycho or a creepy teacher or, like, a-

27:17.943 --> 27:19.970
- Or a lighthouse keeper.

27:19.970 --> 27:21.270
- Maybe it was just some dick.

27:21.270 --> 27:24.890
Some power hungry bully
who just happened to kill

27:24.890 --> 27:26.350
our friends first on his-

27:26.350 --> 27:29.180
- Or her.

27:29.180 --> 27:30.740
- Yeah, or her more-

27:30.740 --> 27:32.270
- How can you be so sure?

27:32.270 --> 27:33.810
- Where's the motive?

27:33.810 --> 27:36.510
It's like you said, these
things are always personal.

27:36.510 --> 27:37.990
We don't have some big group secret.

27:37.990 --> 27:39.050
Nothing we did last summer.

27:39.050 --> 27:40.325
So it.

27:40.325 --> 27:41.158
It doesn't make sense.

27:41.158 --> 27:42.098
We're too normal.

27:42.098 --> 27:43.723
- Yeah, normal.

27:43.723 --> 27:44.556
- Normal.

27:45.410 --> 27:46.373
- I guess.

27:47.450 --> 27:49.100
- Why would anyone wanna kill us?

27:51.010 --> 27:52.263
We aren't anything.

27:53.428 --> 27:54.261
Are we?

27:55.786 --> 27:58.286
[tense music]

28:38.195 --> 28:39.210
[dog barking]

28:39.210 --> 28:40.460
- [Kate] Thanks for this.

28:41.360 --> 28:42.193
- [Clive] Yeah, no worries.

28:42.193 --> 28:43.026
Safety in numbers.

28:43.026 --> 28:45.093
- [Kate] Fingers crossed.

28:46.030 --> 28:48.683
Just all so awful.

28:51.220 --> 28:52.330
- [Clive] This walk?

28:52.330 --> 28:54.483
- [Kate] [laughs] No, no, not the walk.

28:55.840 --> 28:56.673
Everything?

28:57.640 --> 28:58.473
- [Clive] Sure.

28:58.473 --> 28:59.306
Yeah, yeah.

29:01.140 --> 29:03.000
- [Kate] How does somebody?

29:03.000 --> 29:03.833
I mean.

29:05.830 --> 29:06.860
You know what I mean.

29:06.860 --> 29:08.693
- [Clive] I know.

29:08.693 --> 29:10.240
I dunno.

29:10.240 --> 29:11.460
- [Kate] Wasn't really
expecting you to have

29:11.460 --> 29:12.615
all the answers.

29:12.615 --> 29:13.633
- [Clive] Oh, well.

29:13.633 --> 29:15.282
Glad to meet your expectations.

29:15.282 --> 29:16.115
- [Kate] [laughs] Yep.

29:16.115 --> 29:18.220
Met and exceeded.

29:18.220 --> 29:19.310
- [Clive] Do what I can.

29:19.310 --> 29:20.543
- [Kate] Ah, do you now?

29:21.452 --> 29:24.332
[dog barking]

29:24.332 --> 29:25.165
So.

29:26.661 --> 29:27.970
- [Clive] So.

29:27.970 --> 29:28.970
- [Kate] This is me.

29:30.060 --> 29:30.960
- [Clive] Oh sure.

29:32.892 --> 29:34.225
- [Kate] Thanks.

29:35.220 --> 29:36.053
- [Clive] Yeah, no.

29:36.053 --> 29:37.349
No worries.

29:37.349 --> 29:38.182
Well goodnight.

29:38.182 --> 29:39.432
- [Kate] Night.

29:40.437 --> 29:41.470
- [Clive] Uh, hey.

29:41.470 --> 29:42.303
- Yeah?

29:43.940 --> 29:45.383
- I was just, um.

29:46.550 --> 29:49.640
Do you wanna grab a coffee
sometime or somethin'?

29:49.640 --> 29:51.867
- Yeah, that'd be great.

29:51.867 --> 29:54.800
Oh, but just as friends?

29:54.800 --> 29:55.633
- Yeah.
- I've.

29:55.633 --> 29:56.720
I've just gotten out of something

29:56.720 --> 29:58.870
and need some time, but.

29:58.870 --> 30:01.240
I would love to get coffee as friends.

30:01.240 --> 30:02.612
- Exactly.

30:02.612 --> 30:03.470
- Well, great.

30:03.470 --> 30:06.210
Well, send me a message
and we'll figure it out.

30:06.210 --> 30:07.130
- Will do.

30:07.130 --> 30:07.963
- All right.

30:07.963 --> 30:09.546
Night.
- Goodnight.

30:10.421 --> 30:13.421
[suspenseful music]

30:20.612 --> 30:23.779
[mechanical whirring]

30:43.866 --> 30:44.730
[shoes scuffing]

30:44.730 --> 30:46.261
- [Clive] She's the perfect target.

30:46.261 --> 30:47.094
- [Desmond] I know.

30:47.094 --> 30:47.927
- [Clive] 'Cause she's known to the group,

30:47.927 --> 30:49.210
but she's not part of the friend circle.

30:49.210 --> 30:51.290
So, it'll look less like
we're being targeted,

30:51.290 --> 30:52.890
but she's someone that Tom knows.

30:52.890 --> 30:55.029
I know we would be stupid not to do it.

30:55.029 --> 30:55.862
- [Desmond] Yep.

30:55.862 --> 30:57.295
- [Clive] Do you follow?

30:57.295 --> 31:00.767
- [Desmond} Maybe you could go
over it a couple more times.

31:05.197 --> 31:08.197
[suspenseful music]

31:29.346 --> 31:30.304
- [Desmond] Hey.

31:30.304 --> 31:31.196
- [Clive] Be quiet.

31:31.196 --> 31:32.322
- [Desmond] No, I've got a question.

31:32.322 --> 31:33.155
- [Clive] Be quiet.

31:33.155 --> 31:35.127
- [Desmond] How will we
know when she's here?

31:36.540 --> 31:39.004
- [Clive] Because we'll
hear her walk in the door.

31:39.004 --> 31:39.837
- [Desmond] Yeah, but what if-

31:39.837 --> 31:43.587
- [Clive] If you keep
talking, we won't hear.

31:48.592 --> 31:50.730
- [Desmond] Do you think
the inside of your cheek

31:50.730 --> 31:52.793
tastes like tongue or cheek?

31:54.070 --> 31:55.019
- [Clive] Fuckin' Christ.

31:55.019 --> 31:55.852
- [Desmond] What?

31:55.852 --> 31:56.710
- [Clive] Look, she's gonna be home soon.

31:56.710 --> 31:59.490
If you keep talking, we
won't hear her pull in.

31:59.490 --> 32:01.629
If we don't hear her pull
in, we won't know she's here

32:01.629 --> 32:02.860
until she opens the door.

32:02.860 --> 32:05.160
Which means she might hear us.

32:05.160 --> 32:06.880
Then she gets ticked off, calls the cops,

32:06.880 --> 32:09.300
we go to jail for murdering
a bunch of people,

32:09.300 --> 32:10.620
and we'll probably be on the bottom rung

32:10.620 --> 32:11.453
of the power ladder,

32:11.453 --> 32:12.653
so we'll be, like, trading cigarettes-

32:12.653 --> 32:13.600
- [Desmond] Shh.

32:13.600 --> 32:15.330
We won't hear her.

32:15.330 --> 32:16.163
- [Clive] Fuck!

32:19.223 --> 32:20.703
- [Desmond] This costume is hot.

32:21.943 --> 32:22.776
Clive?

32:24.885 --> 32:25.718
Clive?

32:27.660 --> 32:28.493
Clive?

32:29.690 --> 32:31.237
Clive?

32:31.237 --> 32:32.987
Clive?
- [Clive] Shut the fuck up.

32:33.893 --> 32:34.726
- [Desmond] When will she be home?

32:34.726 --> 32:36.809
- [Clive] Any minute now.

32:38.245 --> 32:39.078
- [Desmond] So...

32:39.078 --> 32:40.911
- [Clive] So, shut up.

32:41.907 --> 32:42.770
[latch clicking]

32:42.770 --> 32:45.520
[door squeaking]

32:46.635 --> 32:49.635
[door latch clicks]

33:00.900 --> 33:03.567
[water running]

33:28.686 --> 33:30.476
- [Kate] What the fuck?

33:30.476 --> 33:31.525
[door clattering]

33:31.525 --> 33:32.988
- [Desmond] Oh my God.

33:32.988 --> 33:34.298
[footsteps thudding]

33:34.298 --> 33:36.715
[door slams]

33:40.351 --> 33:41.793
[fist thuds]

33:41.793 --> 33:44.460
[water running]

33:54.299 --> 33:56.469
- Come on, come on, come on.

33:56.469 --> 33:59.136
[phone ringing]

34:14.101 --> 34:17.533
[Desmond thudding]

34:17.533 --> 34:20.070
- Clive, how'd you turn out to do this?

34:20.070 --> 34:20.902
I don't know what you're doing.

34:20.902 --> 34:22.289
[flesh squelching]

34:22.289 --> 34:24.956
[Clive gasping]

34:28.975 --> 34:30.225
- Friends, huh?

34:33.821 --> 34:36.571
[birds chirping]

34:37.413 --> 34:39.476
- That one looks like a frog.

34:41.570 --> 34:42.402
- Hm.

34:42.402 --> 34:43.235
Oh yeah.

34:45.360 --> 34:46.194
There.

34:46.194 --> 34:49.536
It's like a witch riding a broom.

34:49.536 --> 34:50.370
- Oh yeah.

34:51.221 --> 34:52.271
Thought it was a cat.

34:56.224 --> 34:57.302
- I like this.

34:57.302 --> 34:58.135
- Hm.

34:58.135 --> 34:59.669
Nice.

34:59.669 --> 35:00.502
- Hm.

35:01.888 --> 35:02.721
Just

35:04.018 --> 35:05.424
you and me.

35:05.424 --> 35:06.424
No one else.

35:07.885 --> 35:08.718
I like it.

35:10.400 --> 35:11.887
- Be nice, you know.

35:13.538 --> 35:15.121
In front of people.

35:17.810 --> 35:18.643
I know.

35:20.389 --> 35:22.683
I just don't know why.

35:25.594 --> 35:26.943
- But.

35:26.943 --> 35:27.776
- But?

35:30.770 --> 35:34.903
A lot of buts but not a
lot of butt stuff going on.

35:34.903 --> 35:37.103
- We are definitely in
the middle of a park.

35:38.442 --> 35:39.857
- Hasn't stopped us before.

35:45.573 --> 35:47.993
I know you have feelings for him.

35:49.557 --> 35:50.390
Clive.

35:52.906 --> 35:53.739
- Wait, what do you-

35:53.739 --> 35:54.739
- It's fine.

35:56.133 --> 35:58.573
Don't understand it, but it's fine.

36:02.840 --> 36:05.970
Have you ever told someone you love them?

36:10.323 --> 36:11.156
- No.

36:13.598 --> 36:16.681
- But you loved someone before, yeah?

36:19.159 --> 36:20.463
- Yes.

36:20.463 --> 36:21.296
- Yes?

36:23.995 --> 36:28.078
- Well, I mean, as much
as you can without, like,

36:30.179 --> 36:31.262
telling them.

36:32.762 --> 36:33.595
Them

36:34.508 --> 36:35.508
telling you.

36:38.228 --> 36:39.061
- Scary.

36:40.436 --> 36:41.269
Isn't it?

36:41.269 --> 36:42.436
Vulnerability.

36:43.997 --> 36:45.164
- Yeah, it is.

36:47.573 --> 36:50.490
- Maybe you should try it sometime.

36:52.688 --> 36:56.021
[soft electronic music]

37:16.600 --> 37:17.683
- I love you.

37:30.768 --> 37:31.837
[water running]

37:31.837 --> 37:34.504
[droning music]

37:42.062 --> 37:44.229
- [Distorted Voice] Clive.

37:54.739 --> 37:55.572
Clive.

38:21.504 --> 38:22.337
Clive.

38:47.969 --> 38:50.469
[tense music]

39:08.469 --> 39:11.219
[knocking thuds]

[door latch clicking]

39:18.275 --> 39:21.293
[upbeat groovy music]

39:21.293 --> 39:22.126
- Hey, Nick.

39:22.126 --> 39:24.163
Happy birthday.

39:24.163 --> 39:26.483
- Doesn't really feel like it, does it?

39:26.483 --> 39:28.304
- [sighing] Yeah, no it's a bit,

39:28.304 --> 39:29.243
a bit rough.

39:29.243 --> 39:31.499
And it seems a little weird
that we're celebrating

39:31.499 --> 39:34.663
after everything we've been through, but

39:34.663 --> 39:36.638
just gotta keep moving forward, you know?

39:36.638 --> 39:37.471
- I guess.

39:38.684 --> 39:39.517
- Look.

39:39.517 --> 39:40.663
I know you feel guilty.

39:42.070 --> 39:44.273
Doug and Sarah.

39:45.114 --> 39:46.377
Kate.

39:46.377 --> 39:47.343
And Taylor.

39:48.644 --> 39:49.819
Look, why don't you have a slice of cake

39:49.819 --> 39:51.605
and enjoy yourself?

39:51.605 --> 39:52.438
No?

39:53.779 --> 39:55.668
- Look at Brenda.

39:55.668 --> 39:57.189
She's not letting it bring her down.

39:57.189 --> 39:59.040
[both laughing]

39:59.040 --> 39:59.873
She's thick.

39:59.873 --> 40:00.706
- Yeah.

40:02.294 --> 40:03.683
So where's Lauren?

40:04.680 --> 40:07.539
- Oh, she's got this board and red string.

40:07.539 --> 40:11.968
Trynna work out all
what's been going on here.

40:11.968 --> 40:14.627
- Has she solved it yet?

40:14.627 --> 40:15.460
- No.

40:16.672 --> 40:17.689
I think she's more sad.

40:17.689 --> 40:18.522
You know?

40:18.522 --> 40:20.272
With all the murders.

40:24.310 --> 40:27.600
- Oh what about the game on the weekend?

40:27.600 --> 40:28.433
Did you win?

40:30.080 --> 40:31.030
- You know what?

40:31.030 --> 40:33.467
My religion forbids gamblin'.

40:34.709 --> 40:35.756
You know that, right?

40:35.756 --> 40:36.589
Didn't I tell you?

40:36.589 --> 40:37.457
- Right.

40:37.457 --> 40:38.290
- Hmm.

40:40.340 --> 40:43.110
- Yeah, I'm just gonna go say hi to him.

40:43.110 --> 40:44.883
- Yeah, enjoy yourself. With love.

40:51.390 --> 40:52.630
- Hey.

40:52.630 --> 40:53.463
- Hey.

40:57.160 --> 40:57.993
Happy birthday.

40:59.480 --> 41:00.726
- Kinda.

41:00.726 --> 41:01.559
- Kind of?

41:04.130 --> 41:05.300
The murders.

41:05.300 --> 41:06.415
Right.

41:06.415 --> 41:07.940
Yeah.

41:07.940 --> 41:10.940
- Doesn't seem like the
cops have a clue who did it.

41:10.940 --> 41:12.240
- Yeah.

41:12.240 --> 41:14.305
- Wonder who will be next.

41:14.305 --> 41:15.190
- I'm

41:15.190 --> 41:18.420
sure it won't be us.

41:18.420 --> 41:19.961
- It's us now?

41:19.961 --> 41:21.665
- Yeah.

41:21.665 --> 41:22.498
Us.

41:26.905 --> 41:31.238
Uh, so, did you get anything
cool for your birthday?

41:33.001 --> 41:34.251
- Dead friends.

41:35.145 --> 41:35.978
- Hmm.

41:37.636 --> 41:39.620
[Brenda scuffling]

41:39.620 --> 41:42.620
[breathing heavily]

41:45.950 --> 41:47.450
- Did you hear?

41:47.450 --> 41:48.283
- What?

41:48.283 --> 41:52.700
- Clive got taken into
questioning about the murders.

41:55.647 --> 41:56.923
- Are you okay?

41:58.810 --> 42:00.013
- Uh, yeah, um.

42:01.310 --> 42:04.227
I, uh, I didn't know where he was.

42:05.200 --> 42:07.393
But I guess that makes sense now.

42:09.400 --> 42:13.944
Is it something to be sent?

42:13.944 --> 42:15.270
- There's no way he would do it.

42:15.270 --> 42:17.377
- It doesn't make any sense.

42:17.377 --> 42:18.953
But it makes so much sense.

42:18.953 --> 42:21.010
- I mean he's a weird dude,

42:21.010 --> 42:22.590
but I don't think he'd kill anyone.

42:22.590 --> 42:23.423
- How brazen.

42:23.423 --> 42:25.440
He's part of the group,

42:25.440 --> 42:29.648
but he's, like, a secret
cunt killing all of us.

42:29.648 --> 42:32.025
- I don't think it's a secret.

42:32.025 --> 42:34.442
Or a big secret, nonetheless.

42:36.635 --> 42:38.921

[Desmond sniffing]

43:15.866 --> 43:19.199
[footsteps approaching]

43:21.649 --> 43:22.482
- I, uh.

43:23.897 --> 43:25.271
- Clive?

43:25.271 --> 43:26.104
- Yeah.

43:28.708 --> 43:30.400
He didn't do it.

43:30.400 --> 43:31.233
- Yeah, but.

43:32.620 --> 43:34.373
What are you gonna do about it?

43:35.680 --> 43:36.513
- I dunno.

43:38.780 --> 43:41.240
But, I just can't be here.

43:45.567 --> 43:47.234
I got you somethin'.

43:48.303 --> 43:50.345
[bag crinkling]

43:50.345 --> 43:52.095
Made me think of you.

43:59.244 --> 44:00.494
- What is that?

44:01.617 --> 44:03.284
I don't have a bath.

44:05.487 --> 44:08.404
[static crackling]

[papers slamming]

45:36.253 --> 45:38.920
[clears throat]

45:38.920 --> 45:39.753
- So.

45:41.187 --> 45:42.020
Clive

45:43.258 --> 45:44.091
Dickinson.

45:45.902 --> 45:47.528
- Johnson.

45:47.528 --> 45:48.361
- Johnson.

45:52.436 --> 45:56.517
How you get yourself in a mess like this?

45:56.517 --> 45:57.976
- Uh.

45:57.976 --> 45:59.893
You knocked on my door.

46:01.076 --> 46:02.526
- You think you're smart?

46:02.526 --> 46:04.898
- [scoffs] No, I just.

46:04.898 --> 46:05.731
I don't, I don't-

46:05.731 --> 46:07.218
- Look.

46:07.218 --> 46:09.968
We're just here for some answers.

46:14.648 --> 46:16.672
- Can I know why I'm here?

46:16.672 --> 46:18.236
- I'll ask the questions.

46:18.236 --> 46:19.983
- Okay.

46:19.983 --> 46:21.144
- Why are you here?

46:21.144 --> 46:21.977
- What?

46:21.977 --> 46:23.075
I,

46:23.075 --> 46:24.340
I,

46:24.340 --> 46:25.976
I don't.

46:25.976 --> 46:28.452
Well, obviously I'm here
because you want me to be here.

46:28.452 --> 46:30.119
- I just wanna chat.

46:36.368 --> 46:39.003
- Is this about the murders?

46:39.003 --> 46:40.075
- Is it?

46:40.075 --> 46:40.908
- Well,

46:42.206 --> 46:43.039
is it?

46:43.938 --> 46:45.124
- You tell me.

46:45.124 --> 46:45.957
- I ca-

46:45.957 --> 46:48.075
I don't know what you want me to tell you.

46:48.075 --> 46:49.461
- I think you do.

46:49.461 --> 46:51.628
[sighing]

46:54.403 --> 46:56.848
- Can you just tell me?

46:56.848 --> 46:59.515
[mouth squeaks]

47:00.846 --> 47:03.234
- Do you know who that is?

47:03.234 --> 47:05.010
- [Clive] Her?

47:05.010 --> 47:05.843
Yeah.

47:06.832 --> 47:07.665
- Who is it?

47:07.665 --> 47:08.602
Just go and say her name.

47:08.602 --> 47:09.435
- Kate.

47:10.553 --> 47:12.412
- Somethin' bad happened
to Kate, didn't it?

47:12.412 --> 47:13.855
- Yeah.

47:13.855 --> 47:15.801
- How do you feel about what happened?

47:15.801 --> 47:17.584
- I don't know.

47:17.584 --> 47:18.417
Sad.

47:19.817 --> 47:22.618
[sighs]

47:22.618 --> 47:24.902
I didn't know her well, but.

47:24.902 --> 47:26.020
- But?

47:26.020 --> 47:27.481
- She was nice.

47:27.481 --> 47:30.549
- Nice?

47:30.549 --> 47:31.632
- Yeah, nice.

47:34.059 --> 47:36.393
You know, she treated me like a person.

47:37.293 --> 47:39.623
We only spoke a few times, but,

47:40.960 --> 47:42.110
she left an impression.

47:43.170 --> 47:44.795
- You ever speak on the phone?

47:44.795 --> 47:45.801
- No.

47:45.801 --> 47:46.956
Not really.

47:46.956 --> 47:48.508
I mean,

47:48.508 --> 47:49.790
I don't know.

47:49.790 --> 47:51.040
- That's funny.

47:52.086 --> 47:53.209
- Funny?

47:53.209 --> 47:54.292
- Yeah it is.

47:55.366 --> 47:57.033
- How is that funny?

47:58.147 --> 47:59.314
[papers crinkling]

47:59.314 --> 48:01.731
- Here are her phone records.

48:03.364 --> 48:05.781
Recognize any of the numbers?

48:06.830 --> 48:08.413
Towards the bottom.

48:12.119 --> 48:13.198
- That's mine.

48:13.198 --> 48:14.281
- Yeah it is.

48:15.917 --> 48:19.833
That call was made right
before she was killed.

48:19.833 --> 48:21.166
Before she was murdered.

48:21.166 --> 48:22.083
- Oh.

48:22.083 --> 48:22.947
- Yeah.

48:22.947 --> 48:24.192
Oh.

48:24.192 --> 48:26.778
She called you.

48:26.778 --> 48:28.641
She called you

48:28.641 --> 48:30.103
right before she was murdered.

48:32.529 --> 48:33.362
Why?

48:40.775 --> 48:43.942
- Look, I walked her home a few nights

48:45.232 --> 48:46.065
before.

48:49.790 --> 48:52.164
I set up a Facebook group for
people who want walks home,

48:52.164 --> 48:56.150
who don't wanna walk home
alone because of the murders.

48:56.150 --> 48:58.070
She messaged, said she wanted a walk home,

48:58.070 --> 48:59.697
so I walked her home.

49:02.027 --> 49:03.477
I don't know why she rang me.

49:05.000 --> 49:07.150
I guess she felt safe
with me or something.

49:09.086 --> 49:10.557
- Facebook group, eh?

49:10.557 --> 49:11.620
- Yeah.

49:11.620 --> 49:13.730
It's just something I
thought I could do to help.

49:13.730 --> 49:14.673
- That's not a bad idea.

49:15.980 --> 49:16.813
- Thanks.

49:18.425 --> 49:20.118
- [inhales] You know,

49:20.118 --> 49:23.857
if I was gonna kill a
whole bunch of people,

49:25.030 --> 49:28.583
wouldn't be a bad way of
throwin' off suspicion.

49:30.507 --> 49:32.063
- Do I need a lawyer?

49:34.600 --> 49:36.940
Look, I didn't do anything.

49:36.940 --> 49:37.913
She.

49:39.220 --> 49:40.053
Kate.

49:41.610 --> 49:42.890
Obviously needed help.

49:42.890 --> 49:44.227
And she called me.

49:44.227 --> 49:46.743
So, she must've thought
that I could help her

49:47.640 --> 49:48.890
and I couldn't.

49:50.719 --> 49:53.219
Now, I don't know how to feel.

50:01.247 --> 50:03.705
[mouth squeaks]

50:03.705 --> 50:05.372
- You're free to go.

50:07.034 --> 50:07.867
- What?

50:10.371 --> 50:11.454
- You can go.

50:12.994 --> 50:16.556
You have to know this is a tough case.

50:16.556 --> 50:18.966
We're waitin' on some
DNA, but besides that

50:18.966 --> 50:19.799
we got nothin'.

50:19.799 --> 50:21.606
We know you didn't do it.

50:21.606 --> 50:26.288
I mean why you gonna call
the person who's killin' ya?

50:26.288 --> 50:27.278
Just wanted to bring you in.

50:27.278 --> 50:28.111
Fuck around with ya.

50:28.111 --> 50:29.611
See what came out.

50:30.878 --> 50:32.380
- Oh okay.

50:32.380 --> 50:33.538
Crap.

50:33.538 --> 50:35.554
- Get outta here, kid.

50:35.554 --> 50:38.637
Go to a grief counselor or somethin'.

50:43.525 --> 50:45.061
- Yeah.

50:45.061 --> 50:47.644

[car door slams]

51:07.957 --> 51:08.790
- Hey.

51:12.916 --> 51:15.554
- [Radio Broadcaster] There
has been another murder.

51:15.554 --> 51:17.150
A man was found dead
this morning in Highgate

51:17.150 --> 51:20.400
bearing all the hallmarks of
the recent spate of killings.

51:20.400 --> 51:23.240
The victim was part
aboriginal which leads some

51:23.240 --> 51:26.720
to suspect that the murders
may be racially motivated.

51:26.720 --> 51:28.810
Police are requesting
anyone with information

51:28.810 --> 51:29.728
to come forward.

51:38.280 --> 51:40.160
- [Lauren] Hey, over here.

51:40.160 --> 51:40.993
- Okay.

51:44.580 --> 51:45.413
Whoa.

51:46.440 --> 51:47.273
This is...

51:48.500 --> 51:49.485
Thorough.

51:49.485 --> 51:50.757
- You know me.

51:50.757 --> 51:51.590
Thorough.

51:51.590 --> 51:52.423
- Yeah.

51:54.459 --> 51:56.959
[tense music]

51:59.888 --> 52:00.805
- Thorough.

52:02.145 --> 52:04.233
- Hey, I'm sorry.

52:05.810 --> 52:07.000
- For what?

52:07.000 --> 52:08.890
- Well, I know when
Tom and I got together,

52:08.890 --> 52:11.660
things changed between us.

52:11.660 --> 52:12.940
- No.

52:12.940 --> 52:14.240
- They did.

52:14.240 --> 52:15.073
You know it.

52:15.073 --> 52:15.906
I know it.

52:16.763 --> 52:19.757
- Yeah, but, I think
that's natural, you know.

52:19.757 --> 52:22.653
You meet someone,
obviously priorities shift.

52:23.830 --> 52:27.450
- Yeah, but we used to
be such good friends.

52:27.450 --> 52:30.119
I think I forgot that and pushed you away.

52:30.119 --> 52:31.350
- No you didn't.

52:31.350 --> 52:32.203
- Clive, I did.

52:33.960 --> 52:35.528
- Yeah, I mean you did.

52:35.528 --> 52:36.662
A little.

52:36.662 --> 52:38.179
[Lauren laughs]

52:38.179 --> 52:39.329
- Feels good to say it.

52:40.294 --> 52:41.740
Forgive me?

52:41.740 --> 52:42.870
- There's nothing to forgive.

52:42.870 --> 52:43.853
- There is.

52:44.700 --> 52:45.767
I still love you.

52:47.260 --> 52:49.660
We used to be such good friends and

52:49.660 --> 52:50.493
I miss that.

52:51.470 --> 52:52.303
I want you back.

52:52.303 --> 52:53.340
I want my friend back.

52:54.300 --> 52:55.133
Yeah?

52:56.935 --> 52:58.595
Hugs?

52:58.595 --> 52:59.428
- Hugs.

53:01.222 --> 53:02.660
- We need to be closer now.

53:02.660 --> 53:03.493
All of us.

53:04.739 --> 53:05.572
- Yeah.

53:06.458 --> 53:07.720
What about Tom?

53:07.720 --> 53:08.910
Aren't you worried?

53:08.910 --> 53:10.240
- He didn't do it.

53:10.240 --> 53:12.240
I was with him when someone...

53:12.240 --> 53:13.620
It happened.

53:13.620 --> 53:15.230
- Yeah.

53:15.230 --> 53:16.655
Aren't there always two of them, though?

53:16.655 --> 53:18.110
You never talk about others.

53:18.110 --> 53:19.950
- Like a stupid best friend?

53:19.950 --> 53:20.920
- I don't know.

53:20.920 --> 53:21.820
- He didn't do it.

53:23.860 --> 53:25.775
- Why do you think they called him in?

53:25.775 --> 53:27.320
- Why'd they call you in?

53:27.320 --> 53:30.010
- Oh, well, I walked Kate home and

53:31.130 --> 53:32.850
she called me when.

53:32.850 --> 53:33.700
- [Lauren] Sorry.

53:35.720 --> 53:38.029
- Out of everyone, I
was the one she called.

53:38.029 --> 53:40.759
- [Lauren] Oh, she must
have felt safe around you.

53:40.759 --> 53:41.592
- I guess.

53:42.450 --> 53:45.117
[phone ringing]

53:46.040 --> 53:46.873
- Oh, it's Tom.

53:48.170 --> 53:49.770
Hey.

53:49.770 --> 53:51.020
No, I'm just with Clive.

53:51.020 --> 53:52.651
They let you go?

53:52.651 --> 53:55.401
[birds chirping]

54:00.810 --> 54:02.090
Okay.

54:02.090 --> 54:03.660
Glad that's over.

54:03.660 --> 54:04.493
Right.

54:04.493 --> 54:05.982
Headin' there now.

54:05.982 --> 54:06.815
Love you.

54:08.838 --> 54:10.357
- What is it?

54:10.357 --> 54:11.370
- Not sure.

54:11.370 --> 54:14.539
Something about it being clear
someone is setting him up.

54:14.539 --> 54:15.410
- Setting him up?

54:15.410 --> 54:16.680
That's weird.

54:16.680 --> 54:17.960
- Yeah.

54:17.960 --> 54:20.430
Why would anyone do that?

54:20.430 --> 54:21.970
- Maybe he does have a dark past.

54:21.970 --> 54:23.200
- Come on.

54:23.200 --> 54:25.410
- Well, you said it yourself.

54:25.410 --> 54:27.360
Someone did it, there must be a reason.

54:29.460 --> 54:31.446
- Anyway, I should get goin'.

54:31.446 --> 54:32.279
He's headed home.

54:32.279 --> 54:34.702
I should be there when he gets there.

54:34.702 --> 54:36.644
- Yeah.

54:36.644 --> 54:40.718
Okay.

54:40.718 --> 54:41.914
Oh, yeah.

54:41.914 --> 54:42.747
Okay.

54:42.747 --> 54:43.580
I'll.

54:44.706 --> 54:45.600
- Thanks.

54:45.600 --> 54:47.312
I appreciate this.

54:47.312 --> 54:48.360
And you.

54:48.360 --> 54:49.410
You know that, right?

54:50.670 --> 54:51.986
- Sure.

54:51.986 --> 54:53.319
- We'll be okay.

55:00.500 --> 55:02.740
- Okay, so this clearly didn't work.

55:02.740 --> 55:03.730
- Clearly.

55:03.730 --> 55:04.780
- Why didn't it work?

55:06.060 --> 55:06.893
- I don't know.

55:07.890 --> 55:09.230
- Tom's been cleared.

55:09.230 --> 55:10.063
- Yes.

55:10.063 --> 55:10.896
- I've been cleared.

55:10.896 --> 55:11.729
- Yes.

55:11.729 --> 55:12.562
- So what do we have to do to make them

55:12.562 --> 55:13.530
think it's Tom again?

55:14.640 --> 55:16.490
- Well, maybe they still suspect him.

55:17.330 --> 55:18.590
- What?

55:18.590 --> 55:20.680
- Could be the old catch and release,

55:20.680 --> 55:24.550
where they, like, know it's him, but

55:24.550 --> 55:26.630
they don't have enough
evidence to convict him.

55:26.630 --> 55:29.980
So, they let him go, hoping
that he'll slip up again.

55:29.980 --> 55:31.830
- We left his DNA all
over the crime scene.

55:31.830 --> 55:33.733
I don't know what else we
could've done to set him up.

55:34.749 --> 55:35.763
- [sighs] Yeah.

55:39.070 --> 55:40.575
- Wait, are they doing that with me?

55:40.575 --> 55:41.840
- Hm?

55:41.840 --> 55:42.673
No.

55:44.720 --> 55:45.553
Maybe.

55:47.960 --> 55:48.840
- No, no, they can't.

55:48.840 --> 55:51.937
Because if they thought it
was me then they'd have proof.

55:51.937 --> 55:53.090
- You did vomit everywhere.

55:53.090 --> 55:55.390
- But so did you and you
didn't get pulled in.

55:56.530 --> 55:57.363
- True.

55:57.363 --> 55:58.196
Just you.

56:02.170 --> 56:03.003
Although.

56:03.926 --> 56:04.890
- Although?

56:04.890 --> 56:08.120
- Well, the way we've
been doing everything...

56:08.120 --> 56:11.090
I mean, it's not as if everyone's
looking for two people.

56:11.090 --> 56:11.923
- No, they shouldn't be.

56:11.923 --> 56:12.850
They should just be looking for Tom.

56:12.850 --> 56:13.683
- Exactly.

56:13.683 --> 56:17.070
So, once they found your DNA in the vom,

56:17.070 --> 56:19.003
they would've stopped looking.

56:20.630 --> 56:22.640
- Cops don't just stop looking.

56:22.640 --> 56:23.977
They get to the crime scene, go,

56:23.977 --> 56:27.031
"Oh, look here's this moth,
let's all go home early now.

56:27.031 --> 56:28.730
Go to the pub."

56:28.730 --> 56:30.420
- Did we leave a moth?

56:30.420 --> 56:31.253
- No.

56:31.253 --> 56:32.960
It's a euphemism.

56:32.960 --> 56:34.620
Or a parable.

56:34.620 --> 56:36.910
I'm saying, they would've found your DNA

56:36.910 --> 56:37.950
if there was any there to find.

56:37.950 --> 56:39.280
And there was and they didn't.

56:39.280 --> 56:41.458
So they didn't find mine, right?

56:41.458 --> 56:42.291
- Right.

56:45.650 --> 56:47.510
Let's say they're not stringing Tom along.

56:47.510 --> 56:48.550
- And they might be.

56:48.550 --> 56:51.173
- Sure, but let's say they're not.

56:52.520 --> 56:55.103
What would have to happen to make them?

56:58.980 --> 57:02.860
- Well Lauren said something
about DNA being so old and

57:02.860 --> 57:05.183
so obviously placed
that it looked planted.

57:09.120 --> 57:11.413
- You know, that would
make a pretty good cover.

57:12.320 --> 57:13.153
- Cover?

57:14.168 --> 57:19.010
- Yeah, like, I make it so
obvious that I did a murder

57:19.880 --> 57:22.773
that I can't have been
the one to do it, right?

57:29.000 --> 57:29.833
- 'Kay.

57:36.982 --> 57:37.882
Yeah, that's good.

57:41.060 --> 57:42.620
Okay, so, we get someone else.

57:42.620 --> 57:44.180
- Mm hm.

57:44.180 --> 57:46.080
- Really jizz up the place.

57:46.080 --> 57:46.913
Saying that it's him,

57:46.913 --> 57:48.447
saying that it's not him.

57:48.447 --> 57:49.530
- Mm.

57:49.530 --> 57:51.570
- But he has to get too
clever and fuck it up.

57:51.570 --> 57:53.140
- Yeah, good thinking.

57:53.140 --> 57:54.490
- How much do we have left?

57:55.426 --> 57:56.259
- Jizz?

57:57.330 --> 57:58.233
Not much.

57:59.170 --> 58:02.450
- We'll have to get real
deliberate with its placement.

58:02.450 --> 58:03.623
- What are you thinking?

58:10.640 --> 58:11.740
- He wants to meet up.

58:12.920 --> 58:14.743
- He wants to meet?

58:16.890 --> 58:18.380
- Yeah.

58:18.380 --> 58:19.510
- Maybe...

58:20.590 --> 58:21.423
You should?

58:23.670 --> 58:24.503
- Yeah?

58:25.949 --> 58:26.782
- Yeah.

58:29.591 --> 58:30.424
- Yeah.

58:36.041 --> 58:38.854
Why'd you cover your mouth?

58:38.854 --> 58:41.687
[cars driving by]

58:44.210 --> 58:47.043
[light pop music]

58:55.791 --> 58:56.624
- Hey, man.

58:56.624 --> 58:57.457
- Oh hey.

58:57.457 --> 58:58.707
How's it goin'?

58:59.781 --> 59:01.380
Want some tea?

59:01.380 --> 59:02.605
- Sure.

59:02.605 --> 59:04.105
- I love this tea.

59:05.881 --> 59:06.838
This is gonna sound weird,

59:06.838 --> 59:09.073
but when I brew it at home,

59:09.073 --> 59:11.573
I offer a little prayer to it.

59:12.600 --> 59:13.433
- Okay.

59:14.380 --> 59:16.663
- There's something so
soothing about tea, you know.

59:18.090 --> 59:19.653
Just the brewing it,

59:20.743 --> 59:22.240
just the ritual of it is-

59:22.240 --> 59:25.033
Ah, it's like cumming.

59:26.920 --> 59:28.593
- I've never really thought about it.

59:28.593 --> 59:29.920
[glass clinks]
- Really?

59:29.920 --> 59:31.207
You should.

59:31.207 --> 59:32.463
'Cause it is a ritual.

59:33.409 --> 59:34.610
- Okay.

59:34.610 --> 59:37.803
- You see, you grab these leaves.

59:39.380 --> 59:42.044
And you curdle 'em, you
know, with boiling water.

59:42.044 --> 59:43.053
Wait a few minutes,

59:44.830 --> 59:46.970
breathing in the gentle steam.

59:46.970 --> 59:48.570
Letting it go through your body.

59:50.030 --> 59:51.080
Then, when it's done,

59:52.340 --> 59:55.040
you put your cup in front of you,

59:55.040 --> 59:56.953
letting the warm water flow forth.

59:58.427 --> 1:00:01.350
And you grab that cup in your hand,

1:00:01.350 --> 1:00:04.207
letting its warm pulse trip your fingers,

1:00:04.207 --> 1:00:06.430
before you bring it to your face

1:00:06.430 --> 1:00:07.593
and take a deep breath.

1:00:08.933 --> 1:00:11.683
[inhales deeply]

1:00:12.723 --> 1:00:15.473
[exhales loudly]

1:00:17.370 --> 1:00:19.860
And the ritual's complete.

1:00:19.860 --> 1:00:20.700
It's good, huh?

1:00:21.540 --> 1:00:22.373
- It is good.

1:00:24.107 --> 1:00:28.823
- I know that you caught up
with Lauren when I was, um.

1:00:31.640 --> 1:00:32.773
I was, uh.

1:00:34.090 --> 1:00:35.028
- Arrested?

1:00:35.028 --> 1:00:35.861
- Yeah.

1:00:35.861 --> 1:00:37.220
- Arrested about the murders?

1:00:37.220 --> 1:00:39.310
- Yeah, I just wanted to say thank you

1:00:39.310 --> 1:00:42.040
for being there for her when I couldn't.

1:00:42.040 --> 1:00:42.975
- Ah, yeah.

1:00:42.975 --> 1:00:43.808
No worries.

1:00:43.808 --> 1:00:44.981
- Yeah.

1:00:44.981 --> 1:00:47.064
What was it like for you?

1:00:48.370 --> 1:00:49.543
- Oh, um.

1:00:50.712 --> 1:00:52.400
You know, weird.

1:00:52.400 --> 1:00:53.540
- Were you scared?

1:00:55.265 --> 1:00:56.098
- Uh.

1:00:57.160 --> 1:00:57.993
- I was.

1:00:59.456 --> 1:01:01.020
- Yeah, yeah.

1:01:01.020 --> 1:01:01.853
I mean,

1:01:02.852 --> 1:01:05.550
I was.

1:01:05.550 --> 1:01:08.365
What'd they say to you?

1:01:08.365 --> 1:01:10.077
- They thought I was behind them.

1:01:10.077 --> 1:01:10.910
- But why?

1:01:10.910 --> 1:01:12.150
How?

1:01:12.150 --> 1:01:13.180
- Why'd they think you were?

1:01:13.180 --> 1:01:15.160
- Oh, because I walked Kate home.

1:01:15.160 --> 1:01:18.120
And I was the last
person she tried to call.

1:01:18.120 --> 1:01:18.953
- Sorry.

1:01:18.953 --> 1:01:20.307
I'm sorry, dude.

1:01:20.307 --> 1:01:21.396
- No, it's all right.

1:01:21.396 --> 1:01:22.690
- No, I'm actually really sorry that

1:01:22.690 --> 1:01:24.840
you had to go through all this.

1:01:24.840 --> 1:01:26.630
You did a really good thing and

1:01:26.630 --> 1:01:30.467
she clearly trusted you
and reached out to you.

1:01:30.467 --> 1:01:32.290
I just can only imagine how you feel

1:01:32.290 --> 1:01:35.252
knowing that you couldn't
get there in time.

1:01:35.252 --> 1:01:36.085
- Yep.

1:01:38.941 --> 1:01:39.858
- You okay?

1:01:41.870 --> 1:01:44.010
- Yeah, just.

1:01:44.010 --> 1:01:46.323
Still figuring out what
to think about all this.

1:01:47.210 --> 1:01:48.360
- Tell me about it.

1:01:48.360 --> 1:01:49.193
- Mm.

1:01:50.310 --> 1:01:51.640
[Tom sighs]

1:01:51.640 --> 1:01:52.640
So, what'd they,

1:01:53.600 --> 1:01:54.873
were they sayin'?

1:01:58.693 --> 1:02:00.113
- They found my DNA.

1:02:01.480 --> 1:02:02.313
- Really?

1:02:03.404 --> 1:02:04.730
How?

1:02:04.730 --> 1:02:05.580
- I have no idea.

1:02:08.215 --> 1:02:09.170
[sighs heaviLy]

1:02:09.170 --> 1:02:12.433
Someone threw a bunch of my jizz around.

1:02:13.517 --> 1:02:14.350
- Jizz?

1:02:15.250 --> 1:02:18.590
To make it look like you
jerked off at the crime scene.

1:02:18.590 --> 1:02:20.160
- I guess so.

1:02:20.160 --> 1:02:24.857
- And, how did they
figure that it wasn't you?

1:02:26.090 --> 1:02:29.170
- Well, apparently,
sperm has this half-life.

1:02:29.170 --> 1:02:32.090
And mine were dead, so
they knew it was old.

1:02:32.090 --> 1:02:33.100
- Half-life.

1:02:33.100 --> 1:02:34.588
- [Tom] Yeah.

1:02:34.588 --> 1:02:36.059
- I guess whoever did it wasn't storing it

1:02:36.059 --> 1:02:37.360
in a fridge or something.

1:02:37.360 --> 1:02:39.478
That would've been sensible.

1:02:39.478 --> 1:02:40.311
- [Tom] Yeah.

1:02:40.311 --> 1:02:41.144
Yeah.

1:02:42.181 --> 1:02:43.731
But who the hell would do that?

1:02:44.725 --> 1:02:46.400
And how would they even?

1:02:46.400 --> 1:02:48.230
- Oh, just go through your bins.

1:02:48.230 --> 1:02:49.726
- Hm.

1:02:49.726 --> 1:02:50.559
I guess so.

1:02:52.617 --> 1:02:53.817
[sighs]

1:02:53.817 --> 1:02:56.980
It's just so weird, isn't it?

1:02:56.980 --> 1:02:58.323
- Yeah, yeah, it's weird.

1:02:59.350 --> 1:03:02.317
Not only is there a
murderer running around,

1:03:02.317 --> 1:03:04.180
there's, what, a jizz thief?

1:03:04.180 --> 1:03:05.013
So weird.

1:03:06.520 --> 1:03:08.440
- Whoever did it is
definitely throwing off

1:03:08.440 --> 1:03:11.340
suspicion from themself or themselves.

1:03:11.340 --> 1:03:12.173
- Yeah.

1:03:12.173 --> 1:03:13.560
Yeah, 'cause.

1:03:13.560 --> 1:03:16.582
Yeah, surely there's no more
of a plan to it than that.

1:03:16.582 --> 1:03:18.082
I mean, it's just.

1:03:20.165 --> 1:03:22.767

1:03:22.767 --> 1:03:24.120
"I'll have that jizz."

1:03:24.120 --> 1:03:27.000
And then just gapped it
around a crime scene.

1:03:27.000 --> 1:03:27.833
- Yeah.

1:03:28.996 --> 1:03:30.984
That's the only.

1:03:30.984 --> 1:03:31.984
That's the only exp-

1:03:33.560 --> 1:03:34.951
Explanation, really.

together through this.

- Help you do what?

1:17:58.230 --> 1:17:59.090
- Well, you know Lauren.

1:17:59.090 --> 1:17:59.923
- [Brenda] Yeah?

1:18:01.279 --> 1:18:02.230
- Um, well.

1:18:02.230 --> 1:18:04.410
We used to be good friends.

1:18:04.410 --> 1:18:05.243
Great friends.

1:18:05.243 --> 1:18:06.076
Talk all the time.

1:18:06.076 --> 1:18:07.873
And then, she met Tom.

1:18:09.135 --> 1:18:10.450
And, I know everyone
thinks he's a great guy,

1:18:10.450 --> 1:18:13.440
but I thought she would notice.

1:18:13.440 --> 1:18:14.410
I thought everyone would notice,

1:18:14.410 --> 1:18:15.840
but only I could see.

1:18:15.840 --> 1:18:17.478
So,

1:18:17.478 --> 1:18:18.312
I had to.

1:18:18.312 --> 1:18:19.145
It was only right

1:18:20.545 --> 1:18:21.750
to set him up.

1:18:21.750 --> 1:18:23.284
To show everyone the truth.

1:18:23.284 --> 1:18:24.117
- Ah?

1:18:24.117 --> 1:18:24.950
- He's a dick.

1:18:24.950 --> 1:18:27.053
And, she deserves better.

1:18:28.040 --> 1:18:28.873
- You.

1:18:30.210 --> 1:18:31.043
- Well, yeah.

1:18:31.043 --> 1:18:32.690
- Are you kidding me?

1:18:32.690 --> 1:18:33.523
- What?

1:18:33.523 --> 1:18:34.356
- Are you kidding me?

1:18:34.356 --> 1:18:35.189
- No.

1:18:35.189 --> 1:18:37.030
- That's what this is all about?

1:18:37.030 --> 1:18:37.862
- Yes.

1:18:37.862 --> 1:18:40.219
- Some entitlement shit, really?

1:18:40.219 --> 1:18:41.053
- No, no, no.

1:18:41.053 --> 1:18:42.360
I was merely doing my duty.

1:18:42.360 --> 1:18:45.929
I mean, I needed to
explain to everyone that

1:18:45.929 --> 1:18:49.083
she had made a poor
choice and that there was

1:18:49.083 --> 1:18:50.510
a much better choice
right in front of her.

1:18:50.510 --> 1:18:51.553
- Jesus, fuck.

1:18:52.662 --> 1:18:54.331
- What?

1:18:54.331 --> 1:18:55.664
- Now, what about you?

1:18:55.664 --> 1:18:56.496
- What about him?

1:18:56.496 --> 1:18:57.570
- What about me?

1:18:57.570 --> 1:18:58.610
- You haven't told him?

1:18:58.610 --> 1:18:59.511
- Told him what?

1:18:59.511 --> 1:19:00.344
- Told me what?

1:19:00.344 --> 1:19:01.358
- You're shitting me.

1:19:01.358 --> 1:19:02.191
You haven't told him?

1:19:02.191 --> 1:19:03.023
- Told me what?

1:19:03.023 --> 1:19:04.349
- There's nothing to tell.

1:19:04.349 --> 1:19:05.182
- You're a soft cock.

1:19:05.182 --> 1:19:07.540
You love him and you haven't told him.

1:19:07.540 --> 1:19:11.433
That is not what this
friendship is about, is it?

1:19:13.410 --> 1:19:14.932
- I, um,

1:19:14.932 --> 1:19:16.309
I may

1:19:17.790 --> 1:19:20.750
have had some, um-

1:19:20.750 --> 1:19:21.670
- Some?

1:19:21.670 --> 1:19:22.503
- Feelings.

1:19:22.503 --> 1:19:23.403
- Feelings?

1:19:24.370 --> 1:19:25.202
- Yeah.

1:19:26.139 --> 1:19:27.440
- Like comraderie?

1:19:27.440 --> 1:19:29.610
Like, like Frodo and Sam?

1:19:29.610 --> 1:19:31.270
- Which interpretation?

1:19:31.270 --> 1:19:32.103
- What?

1:19:35.607 --> 1:19:36.670
- I thought if.

1:19:36.670 --> 1:19:38.639
If maybe I helped you out, then

1:19:39.840 --> 1:19:41.790
we'd get closer.

1:19:41.790 --> 1:19:43.260
- Yeah, as friends.

1:19:43.260 --> 1:19:44.320
- Friends. Yeah, sure.

1:19:44.320 --> 1:19:45.639
- This is bullshit.

1:19:45.639 --> 1:19:47.683
He wants to fuck you.

1:19:47.683 --> 1:19:48.612
- No.

1:19:48.612 --> 1:19:50.240
Whoa.

1:19:50.240 --> 1:19:52.670
- Uh, I, um.

1:19:52.670 --> 1:19:53.503
- Really?

1:19:54.750 --> 1:19:55.583
- Yeah.

1:19:56.662 --> 1:19:57.710
- Are you serious?

1:19:57.710 --> 1:19:59.719
- That's exactly what
you're doing with Lauren.

1:19:59.719 --> 1:20:01.746
- No, no it's.

1:20:01.746 --> 1:20:03.180
No, I'm.

1:20:03.180 --> 1:20:04.067
There's nuance.

1:20:05.892 --> 1:20:06.725
- Nuance?

1:20:06.725 --> 1:20:07.580
- Yes.

1:20:07.580 --> 1:20:09.710
My left flap, there's nuance.

1:20:09.710 --> 1:20:11.770
You've concocted this bullshit,

1:20:11.770 --> 1:20:13.660
because you think that
she owes you something.

1:20:13.660 --> 1:20:17.800
Because, what, you've put
a few friendship coins in?

1:20:17.800 --> 1:20:19.760
And you, what, you
think he's gonna open up

1:20:19.760 --> 1:20:24.270
his butthole because you helped
him kill a bunch of people?

1:20:24.270 --> 1:20:25.103
- I'd be the-

1:20:25.103 --> 1:20:25.936
- Rhetorical.

1:20:25.936 --> 1:20:28.530
Nobody owes you shit.

1:20:28.530 --> 1:20:30.920
Especially when you've
done fuck-all to earn it.

1:20:30.920 --> 1:20:33.785
Like, everything is so fucked right now,

1:20:33.785 --> 1:20:35.330
because entitled pricks like you.

1:20:35.330 --> 1:20:38.980
You're just too fucking incel man-babies

1:20:38.980 --> 1:20:40.213
who think that the world
revolves around them

1:20:40.213 --> 1:20:43.708
because you happen to
be white and have dicks.

1:20:43.708 --> 1:20:46.049
So, fuck both of you.

Just Clive.

- Ah, you're alive.

- What the fuck is going on?

1:25:08.270 --> 1:25:09.103
- Brenda.

1:25:09.103 --> 1:25:09.936
She's behind it all.

1:25:09.936 --> 1:25:11.070
- How did we not see this?

1:25:11.070 --> 1:25:11.903
- I don't know.

1:25:11.903 --> 1:25:12.855
She was with us,

1:25:12.855 --> 1:25:13.688
hanging out with us,

1:25:13.688 --> 1:25:14.521
talking to us,

1:25:14.521 --> 1:25:16.702
planning to kill us?

1:25:16.702 --> 1:25:18.414
- Why would she do such a thing?

1:25:18.414 --> 1:25:19.588
Such an awful thing.

1:25:19.588 --> 1:25:22.110
- Maybe she just felt like
she wasn't appreciated

1:25:22.110 --> 1:25:24.460
or validated or something.

1:25:24.460 --> 1:25:25.950
- So, it's a lesson?

1:25:25.950 --> 1:25:27.222
- Yeah, well, I mean, I don't know.

1:25:27.222 --> 1:25:28.055
I'm not a murderer.

1:25:28.055 --> 1:25:30.425
I'm in here hiding from the murderer, so.

1:25:30.425 --> 1:25:31.259
- I just can't believe this.

1:25:31.259 --> 1:25:32.740
It doesn't make any sense.

1:25:32.740 --> 1:25:34.050
- Yeah, but, does it have to?

1:25:34.050 --> 1:25:35.070
I mean she's killed people

1:25:35.070 --> 1:25:35.903
and is killing people,

1:25:35.903 --> 1:25:37.754
so maybe she's just a murderer.

1:25:37.754 --> 1:25:39.004
- Yeah, that makes sense.

1:25:39.907 --> 1:25:40.740
- Does it?

1:25:42.410 --> 1:25:45.573
- God, can we just focus on
trying to get out of here alive?

1:25:47.172 --> 1:25:48.005
We can sort that out after.

1:25:48.005 --> 1:25:49.410

how to tell you this, but.

- What?

1:25:58.554 --> 1:25:59.580
- [Lauren] Desmond.
