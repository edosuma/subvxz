01:04.656 --> 01:07.859
<i>(woman)</i> Ema Hesire,
I know you're in there.

01:10.746 --> 01:12.785
The wedding has been all arranged.

01:13.331 --> 01:17.281
Oh, please, gods.
Please get me out of this.

01:17.836 --> 01:20.837
You turned down the jeweller,
the grain merchant.

01:20.964 --> 01:23.289
You turned down
the Pharaoh's food taster.

01:23.425 --> 01:27.754
There's only one man left who'll have you.
You are going to marry Hazzi-ra.

01:27.888 --> 01:30.426
So what does he do?

01:30.557 --> 01:32.882
He's a fuel merchant.

01:33.018 --> 01:35.591
- Mother.
- All right, so he sells camel dung.

01:35.729 --> 01:38.136
- Forget it.
- You forget it!

01:38.273 --> 01:42.105
Mother, I don't want to settle down.
I want to do things, invent things.

01:42.235 --> 01:46.363
I want to try things that nobody's
ever tried before. I want to fly.

01:46.490 --> 01:49.693
And I want to smoke
and tell your father to go to hell.

01:50.410 --> 01:53.080
Oh, Emmy, Emmy!

01:53.205 --> 01:57.154
If I thought we women
could in any way change anything,

01:57.292 --> 01:59.332
don't you think I'd encourage you?

01:59.461 --> 02:02.378
No, no, no, no.
These are the times we live in.

02:02.506 --> 02:04.748
Mother, there's got to be a better way.

02:04.883 --> 02:08.169
Please, gods. Please help me find it.

02:08.303 --> 02:12.680
The Nile is overflowing.
There is a wheat shortage.

02:12.808 --> 02:14.847
The Pharaoh has haemorrhoids.

02:14.976 --> 02:18.262
The gods have bigger things
to worry about than you.

02:28.407 --> 02:29.735
Whoa!

02:30.283 --> 02:32.323
Emmy! Oh!

02:34.246 --> 02:37.081
Emmy? Emmy?

02:38.875 --> 02:41.366
Oh, Emmy.

02:41.503 --> 02:43.045
Oh.

You know, you could get

06:24.518 --> 06:27.934
What about quality, boss?
Style and grace? These things take time.

06:28.063 --> 06:30.518
That's it. You're fired!

06:31.525 --> 06:33.601
Fired?

06:34.736 --> 06:39.363
OK, but can I finish her? You see, I'm a

06:39.491 --> 06:41.863
Beat it! Now!

06:51.420 --> 06:54.337
Here you go. Have fun.

07:12.399 --> 07:15.982
Hey! Want a giraffe
for the birthday boy? Huh?

07:16.111 --> 07:19.278
Monkey? A pony? A tiger?

07:19.406 --> 07:22.656
- How about a hint?
- I want the big one, stupid.

07:22.784 --> 07:25.987
Sorry. That's the official Flights
of Fancy balloon. A poodle?

07:26.121 --> 07:29.620
Listen, biscuit brain.
My old man's paying for this party.

07:30.125 --> 07:32.616
One giant balloon coming up.

07:34.838 --> 07:38.005
There you go. Have fun.
Now... what do you want?

Take your hands off my kid!

07:49.019 --> 07:51.344
My balloon! You're fired.

07:51.480 --> 07:53.188
<i>(boy)</i> Whoa!

07:54.524 --> 07:57.858
- Trimmin' hedges long, Switcher?
- Oh, actually, no.

07:57.986 --> 08:02.529
I'm really a sculptor. But, uh, there's
not too much work for us these days.

08:02.657 --> 08:05.658
No reason why hedges
can't become art, though, huh?

08:05.786 --> 08:09.071
You're fired!
Get your paycheck and get outta here!

08:30.727 --> 08:34.595
- What do you think?
- What do I think?

08:35.357 --> 08:40.433
I'm fired! Pick up my paycheck. Get out.
No severance. Never come back.

09:00.590 --> 09:03.426
- Oh, look. The Road Warrior.
- Hi, Roxie.

09:04.428 --> 09:06.467
His Jag's in the shop.

09:06.596 --> 09:08.636
Hi.

09:14.771 --> 09:18.187
- Be nice if you had something with doors.
- Oh, come on.

09:18.316 --> 09:20.986
- Where are we going to dinner?
- I'm not that hungry.

09:21.111 --> 09:24.231
I thought we'd grab a hot dog,
go for a walk, look at the moon?

09:24.364 --> 09:28.029
- You lost your job again.
- I didn't lose it, I know where it is.

09:28.160 --> 09:31.196
- It's just somebody else has got it.
- Oh, jeez. Can we go?

09:31.329 --> 09:34.533
- Good night, Mr Wert.
- Nice work, children.

09:35.751 --> 09:38.372
- Who's that?
- BJ Wert, <i>the</i> regional manager.

09:38.503 --> 09:40.994
He <i>is</i> Illustra.
Now can this bucket of junk go?

09:41.131 --> 09:43.170
Yeah, I'm trying.

09:44.134 --> 09:46.803
- Oh, good night, Roxie.
- Good night!

09:47.429 --> 09:51.474
Must be nice havin' your own limo. You
can go from any funeral right to dinner.

09:51.600 --> 09:53.723
- <i>(engine starts)</i>
- Ah!

09:56.730 --> 10:00.395
This job at Illustra's destroying
your sense of humour. Get a grip!

10:00.525 --> 10:02.851
I'm not the one that can't deal with reality.

10:02.986 --> 10:05.442
Reality is very disappointing.

10:07.949 --> 10:12.410
Jonathan, I care about you, but if we sleep
together tonight it will confuse things.

10:12.537 --> 10:16.037
- I think you should see a professional.
- You mean a hooker?

10:16.166 --> 10:20.033
- No, a psychiatrist.
- I can't afford a psychiatrist, Roxie.

10:20.170 --> 10:22.922
Well, then, call
one of those shrinks on the radio.

10:23.048 --> 10:26.713
They're only good for little problems
that fit between commercials.

10:26.843 --> 10:29.050
Good night, Jonathan.

10:29.513 --> 10:32.004
Roxie, what... Roxie!

10:34.059 --> 10:36.098
<i>(thunder)</i>

10:37.479 --> 10:39.518
Rox!

11:31.950 --> 11:34.073
Oh, my God. It's you!

11:36.788 --> 11:39.279
I wanted to take you home,
but they didn't let me.

11:39.416 --> 11:44.410
You are the first thing I've created in a
long time that made me feel like an artist.

11:53.972 --> 11:56.012
Oh, no.

12:01.646 --> 12:03.686
Whoo!

12:23.251 --> 12:25.374
See you tomorrow!

12:35.597 --> 12:38.302
Good morning. What a gentleman.

12:38.433 --> 12:40.473
They're putting up the sign!

12:41.395 --> 12:43.683
How fun! Yoo-hoo!

12:44.648 --> 12:47.139
It's a scoshe crooked!

12:47.275 --> 12:51.190
Isn't this exciting? A customer
lined up to get into our store.

12:51.321 --> 12:53.990
- Tell me, do you like our new sign?
- It's very nice.

12:54.116 --> 12:58.528
- You really been here a hundred years?
- Not personally, but the store, yes.

12:58.662 --> 13:01.616
It was built by my grandfather,
Tough Teddy Prince.

13:01.748 --> 13:04.370
My father ran it
until he passed away recently.

13:04.501 --> 13:07.122
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Well, he was very old.

13:07.254 --> 13:11.382
And he died the way he wanted to,
in women's lingerie.

13:11.508 --> 13:15.257
- Pardon me?
- Heart attack in the women's department.

13:15.387 --> 13:18.423
Excuse me. They don't have
that sign quite right yet.

13:19.641 --> 13:21.847
- Oh, look out!
- Hey, sorry, man.

13:24.563 --> 13:26.306
Watch yourself, ma'am.

13:28.275 --> 13:30.314
I got it!

13:30.444 --> 13:32.483
Maybe.

13:38.493 --> 13:41.696
- Young man, I'm sorry!
- No, that's... Oh! No problem.

13:42.205 --> 13:43.700
Aah! Oh!

13:43.832 --> 13:47.830
- If I can make it up to you in any way...
- Yeah! I could use a job!

13:47.961 --> 13:51.128
- What do you do?
- Anything.

13:51.256 --> 13:54.506
- When can you start?
- Uh... As soon as I finish this.

13:54.634 --> 13:56.841
Yoo-hoo, young man! What's your name?

13:56.970 --> 14:00.090
- My name? Uh, Jonathan Switcher.
- You're hired!

14:00.557 --> 14:02.300
Thank you. My lucky day.

14:05.270 --> 14:08.354
Every time I walk through these doors,
I feel like I'm home.

14:08.482 --> 14:10.521
I practically grew up here.

14:12.611 --> 14:16.062
Greta Garbo used to get
her make-up right over there.

14:16.198 --> 14:19.483
Of course, you probably
don't know who Greta Garbo is.

14:19.618 --> 14:22.572
Sure I do. <i>Ninotchka, Grand Hotel.</i>

14:23.580 --> 14:26.036
I don't sleep much at night.

14:26.166 --> 14:30.792
Neither do I. At least, not in the two weeks
since I've been in charge here.

14:30.921 --> 14:34.965
I don't know how we're going
to make this store great again!

14:35.092 --> 14:38.757
Looks fine to me. What time do we open?

14:41.765 --> 14:43.804
We are open.

14:45.310 --> 14:47.386
Oh.

14:47.521 --> 14:50.522
Well, I... I'm sure
things'll pick up by lunch.

14:52.067 --> 14:57.108
Yes. Uh... BJ, it's all going
according to plan.

14:57.239 --> 14:59.481
I mean, it's like a ghost ship around here.

14:59.616 --> 15:03.151
They're gonna be beggin'
to sell this place within a month.

15:03.286 --> 15:05.824
No. No, Timkin is no threat.

15:06.707 --> 15:09.280
Well... BJ. Beej. She's here.

15:10.961 --> 15:15.005
Mr Richards, do you know
what this young man just did?

15:15.799 --> 15:18.919
- Uh... Shoplifting?
- He saved my life.

15:19.052 --> 15:21.722
Those incompetents you hired
nearly got me killed.

15:21.847 --> 15:24.219
If I were paranoid,
I'd swear this was sabotage.

15:24.349 --> 15:27.516
Claire, it's not as if I was
turning away Harvard graduates.

15:27.644 --> 15:30.894
If you know someone
you feel is qualified to work here...

15:31.022 --> 15:34.890
Yes! Jonathan Switcher!
Let's show him our gratitude.

15:35.610 --> 15:39.822
- Well, five dollars should do it.
- No, no. I want you to give him a job.

15:39.948 --> 15:41.988
Take good care of him.

15:43.368 --> 15:45.575
Well, uh... Switcher?

15:46.788 --> 15:49.575
What kind of work experience
have you had?

15:49.708 --> 15:53.788
Oh, I've had just about
every job there is. Briefly.

15:54.880 --> 15:58.829
I'd like to do something creative.
Maybe with, say, mannequins.

15:58.967 --> 16:03.510
Please. Uh, listen. I pride myself
on being able to size up a job applicant

16:03.638 --> 16:07.007
and see just what kind
of executive potential he has.

16:08.143 --> 16:09.970
I have just the job for you.

16:22.741 --> 16:26.074
<i>(Roxie) So you got a new job.</i>
<i>That's terrific. What is it?</i>

16:26.203 --> 16:29.204
Let's just say that thousands
of dollars of merchandise

16:29.331 --> 16:31.537
go through my hands every day.

16:31.666 --> 16:35.795
- I'm takin' you for a celebration dinner.
- Those panties, up to Lingerie.

16:35.921 --> 16:38.875
- Panties. Right. I'm into it.
- Did you say "panties"?

16:39.007 --> 16:41.676
- Panties?
- I can't talk now. Pick you up at eight.

16:41.802 --> 16:43.841
- <i>See you then.</i>
- Bye.

16:45.180 --> 16:49.759
I've seen him pick you up.
That little... pissant!

16:49.893 --> 16:53.938
You can't tell me
that he's satisfying you sexually.

16:54.064 --> 16:57.896
- That's none of your business.
- I would like to make it my business.

16:58.026 --> 17:01.775
I would love to sink my teeth
into your... little bottom.

17:01.905 --> 17:03.945
What? What, what?

17:04.907 --> 17:07.066
Did Armand say something bad?
Forgive me!

17:07.202 --> 17:10.286
English and me, it's new.
My tongue, it slides.

17:10.414 --> 17:13.782
Look, our relationship
is strictly business. You got that?

17:13.916 --> 17:19.920
Yes. Of course. I have some reports
to get out by noon o'clock.

17:48.577 --> 17:50.616
Agh!

17:53.248 --> 17:56.035
- See anything you like?
- Just lookin' for panties.

17:56.168 --> 18:01.708
You found them. However, you missed
the lingerie department by four floors.

18:01.840 --> 18:04.082
- Well, get going.
- Right.

18:05.302 --> 18:06.926
Asshole.

18:07.054 --> 18:09.093
What was that?

18:09.222 --> 18:11.678
Oh, nice hall.

18:35.499 --> 18:37.538
I must be losin' my mind.

18:38.794 --> 18:44.380
I guess all artists fall in love with their
creations, but you just seem so... special.

18:46.802 --> 18:48.960
Oh! Well, roll over Bill Shakespeare!

18:49.096 --> 18:51.503
That is the sweetest sentiment
I ever heard.

18:51.640 --> 18:55.554
- Uh, no, no. I was rehearsing a play.
- I always find it best not to explain.

18:55.685 --> 18:59.220
It adds a certain mystique
to one's reputation.

18:59.564 --> 19:03.432
No, no. No. I'm...
I'm a regular kind of guy, OK?

19:04.152 --> 19:07.153
Don't disappoint me.
When you finish your conversation,

19:07.280 --> 19:09.238
please bring her to window three.

19:09.366 --> 19:12.901
Sure. You got it. I'm Jonathan Switcher.

19:13.036 --> 19:16.203
Hollywood. Hollywood Montrose.

19:16.331 --> 19:18.407
Whoo! Doesn't it just sing?

19:18.542 --> 19:21.033
Oh, it sings, yeah.

19:21.169 --> 19:24.455
I'm a window-dresser here.
We're going to have fun, fun, fun!

19:24.589 --> 19:26.748
I am so glad you're working here!

19:27.592 --> 19:30.048
- You are?
- Why, of course I am, honey.

19:30.178 --> 19:33.879
I never thought they'd hire
anyone stranger than me.

19:39.521 --> 19:41.561
<i>(hums)</i>

19:42.065 --> 19:44.105
- <i>(dog growls)</i>
- Oh!

19:49.656 --> 19:52.230
Halt!

19:52.367 --> 19:55.570
- Identify yourself.
- Jonathan Switcher. New stock boy.

19:56.329 --> 20:00.078
Yeah. Mr Richards told me all about you.

20:00.208 --> 20:03.209
I am Captain Felix Maxwell,
night security commander.

20:03.336 --> 20:09.173
It is my responsibility to secure the
perimeter here at... Prince and Company.

20:09.634 --> 20:11.876
I didn't know there was
danger of invasion.

20:12.012 --> 20:16.425
There's no danger of nothing
as long as me and Rambo are on patrol.

20:16.558 --> 20:18.930
- Rambo?
- Yeah.

20:20.020 --> 20:25.560
I call him that
because he likes to draw... first blood.

20:28.904 --> 20:31.691
Just what is your assignment
here tonight, boy?

20:31.823 --> 20:38.740
- I'm helping Hollywood with the window.
- Oh, the little Mary has an assistant, huh?

20:38.872 --> 20:41.659
- Where do you people come from?
- Ohio.

20:41.792 --> 20:44.117
- Ohio?
- Yeah.

20:44.252 --> 20:46.375
You mean they got 'em in Ohio?

20:47.923 --> 20:51.505
So, you like your new assignment?

20:51.635 --> 20:55.335
Could have been worse. Could have
put me on with a bigoted jerk.

20:57.557 --> 21:01.851
Hold it there, boy!
Did you have anybody particular in mind?

21:03.313 --> 21:06.647
Do you think he meant
anybody in particular, Rambo?

21:09.611 --> 21:14.024
Oh, don't let Felix get to you.
He just has a bad case of <i>Miami Vice.</i>

21:14.157 --> 21:18.535
Listen, I gotta go, OK? I promised my
girlfriend I was gonna take her out, OK?

21:18.662 --> 21:22.446
- <i>(screams)</i>
- What? What happened? What did I say?

21:23.917 --> 21:26.752
Albert left me, the bitch.
He said my thighs are too fat.

21:26.878 --> 21:28.788
- Do my thighs look too fat to you?
- No.

21:28.922 --> 21:32.338
- You didn't look!
- I don't know about men's thighs.

21:32.467 --> 21:35.753
- They look fine to me. They really do.
- Thank you.

21:36.972 --> 21:39.297
Albert called me Cellulite City.

21:39.433 --> 21:43.644
Maybe he's right.
Maybe I should have my hips lifted.

21:43.770 --> 21:47.222
- If you wanna lose weight, just... diet.
- Oh, diets are no use.

21:47.357 --> 21:50.691
It's those jelly doughnuts.
They call to me in the night.

21:50.819 --> 21:55.730
"Hollywood! Come and get me,
Hollywood!" I can't stay away from them.

21:55.866 --> 22:00.195
- Like you and women's dressing rooms.
- No, no. That was a misunderstanding.

22:00.328 --> 22:02.654
Have any of your friends
been vacuumed out?

22:02.789 --> 22:05.874
I heard those doctors
in Beverly Hills just open you up

22:06.001 --> 22:09.452
- and suck those fat cells outta there!
- It... it sounds nice.

22:09.796 --> 22:14.174
I wonder if there's any way you could do
it yourself with a vacuum cleaner. Oh!

22:14.301 --> 22:16.459
<i>(sobs)</i>

22:17.387 --> 22:20.970
Albert's been off work for an hour.
There's no telling what he's...

22:21.099 --> 22:24.385
Hollywood, Hollywood.
Hey, hey. Take it easy, OK?

22:24.519 --> 22:27.556
Just go home and get yourself
some rest. You'll be fine.

22:27.689 --> 22:31.188
An artiste does not
leave his work unfinished.

22:31.318 --> 22:33.643
No, it looks fine to me.

22:33.779 --> 22:36.234
In that case, I'm a dream that once was.

22:38.909 --> 22:41.863
Look out, Albert,
because Hollywood is on your case!

22:41.995 --> 22:44.035
- Yeah! Go get 'im.
- Oh!

22:45.499 --> 22:47.538
Good grief.

22:50.253 --> 22:53.872
What's the matter?
Don't you like your new scarf?

22:54.007 --> 22:56.047
Not especially.

22:58.178 --> 23:01.381
- What a funny way to say hello.
- What the hell's going on?

23:02.057 --> 23:05.093
My name is Ema Hesire,
but you can call me Emmy.

23:05.894 --> 23:09.559
This is a joke, right? Some sort
of Prince and Company initiation?

23:09.689 --> 23:13.438
- Who hired you? Hollywood?
- Nobody, Jonathan. You know who I am.

23:13.568 --> 23:15.644
No, no. This can't be happening.

23:16.071 --> 23:19.771
The sign! The electricity.
My brain synapses were destroyed.

23:19.908 --> 23:24.404
I felt so sorry for you last night.
You looked so lost and lonely.

23:25.914 --> 23:30.790
Last night you saw me?
Oh, no. You can't be her.

23:31.253 --> 23:33.660
While making me,
didn't you feel inspiration,

23:33.797 --> 23:36.714
like your hands were moved
by a force not of this world?

23:36.842 --> 23:39.415
You made this body
so that I could come to life!

23:39.803 --> 23:42.294
Tell me, am I
in the twilight zone or just nuts?

23:42.431 --> 23:47.555
- I'm so glad I picked you.
- I'd create someone who doesn't like me?

23:47.686 --> 23:50.687
Tell me your life story.
It seems to have slipped my mind.

23:50.814 --> 23:55.143
It's a long story.
I was born in 2514 BC, in Edfu, Egypt.

23:55.277 --> 23:59.227
- I'll be 4,501 next April.
- I'll bake a cake.

23:59.364 --> 24:02.650
I couldn't do anything. Know
who my parents wanted me to marry?

24:02.784 --> 24:04.824
- Who?
- A camel-dung dealer.

24:07.456 --> 24:09.662
That would have been my guess.
It's stress.

24:09.791 --> 24:12.282
I'm having a hallucination
caused by stress.

24:12.419 --> 24:14.910
Does this feel like a hallucination?

24:15.047 --> 24:17.086
Come on. Let's go have some fun.

24:20.677 --> 24:23.299
Food additives. It's food additives.

24:23.430 --> 24:25.672
Jonathan! Come on!

24:28.894 --> 24:33.935
<i>(TV) Except for early morning clouds,</i>
<i>the weather for the Philadelphia area...</i>

24:34.066 --> 24:36.105
Damn him.

24:41.531 --> 24:43.571
Oh! Oh!

24:48.163 --> 24:52.161
- What I could have done with these toys!
- You like to work with your hands?

24:52.292 --> 24:57.535
Oh, yes. I love to build and invent things.
Back in Edfu I even made a pair of wings.

24:57.672 --> 24:59.914
- And I'm sure you flew.
- That's right!

25:00.675 --> 25:02.964
Well, almost.

25:03.095 --> 25:05.336
You still don't believe I'm real, do you?

25:06.556 --> 25:08.763
Uh... I'm open for discussion.

25:08.892 --> 25:10.351
<i>(nails ricochet)</i>

25:10.936 --> 25:15.728
Why don't we stick to good old-fashioned
hand tools for the time being, OK?

25:16.942 --> 25:19.065
- You've got good hands.
- Thank you.

25:19.194 --> 25:23.274
I like the way they felt
when you were putting me together.

25:27.953 --> 25:30.076
Tonight we'll do something different,

25:30.205 --> 25:32.743
something this store
has never seen before.

25:32.874 --> 25:36.243
- I wish you weren't so worried.
- Easy for you. You're a mannequin.

25:36.378 --> 25:40.245
You'll always have work. Me? I'm gonna
wind up in the nuthouse after this.

25:40.382 --> 25:43.299
Maybe insanity's covered
in the employee health plan.

25:43.427 --> 25:46.262
That's the dress
I should wear in the window.

25:51.935 --> 25:55.933
- Hey, don't do that.
- You weren't shy when you created me.

25:56.064 --> 25:58.104
You weren't so real.

26:00.485 --> 26:03.059
Good God. Who are you?

26:06.533 --> 26:10.068
<i>(TV) Oh, good morning, boys and girls.</i>
<i>I don't see Ziggy.</i>

26:10.203 --> 26:12.445
<i>Oh, she's a big smiley elephant.</i>

26:47.032 --> 26:51.112
Hey, hey! Roxie, you look foxy!
Can I ride you?

26:51.244 --> 26:54.744
- I'll be walking to work, thank you.
- Oh, no, no, no, no.

26:54.873 --> 26:57.660
- Don't be silly. Don't be silly.
- Roxie! Wait!

26:57.793 --> 27:00.794
I thought our plans were
for eight last night. My mistake.

27:00.921 --> 27:02.498
I gotta talk to you.

27:02.631 --> 27:05.501
- We have nothing to talk about.
- Take a hike, wussy pants.

27:05.634 --> 27:09.632
Roxie, I think I'm going crazy.
I saw things I know couldn't happen.

27:09.763 --> 27:11.969
Where were you?
Did you sleep in the street?

27:12.099 --> 27:15.099
- Prince and Company.
- Prince and Company. Your big job!

27:15.227 --> 27:17.385
You know the mannequin that I made?

27:17.521 --> 27:20.640
She's there, and she came to life
and she knew who I was, OK?

27:20.774 --> 27:23.691
You could have told me
you just decided to stand me up.

27:23.819 --> 27:26.985
Instead, you come here
lying with this ridiculous story!

27:27.114 --> 27:29.153
I'm not lying, I'm insane.

27:29.825 --> 27:32.398
Armand, let's just get out of here.

27:45.674 --> 27:49.837
Mom? When I was growing up,
did I ever do anything really strange?

27:50.971 --> 27:55.348
Yeah, I know I was always different.
Let me ask you this.

27:55.475 --> 27:59.343
Is there any history of insanity
in the family? I mean, Gran...

27:59.479 --> 28:02.397
Grandma and Grandpa
weren't half-brother and sister?

28:02.524 --> 28:07.316
No, I'm fine, Ma.
Well, you know, you're alone a lot.

28:07.446 --> 28:10.150
You know, you start inventing things. Ow!

28:10.282 --> 28:12.524
Women, you know, a beautiful woman.

28:12.659 --> 28:16.158
Enough about me. How are you?
You ever have hallucinations?

28:39.978 --> 28:43.892
Roxie, this is America. You do not
set the pace by redecorating.

28:44.024 --> 28:47.227
- You demolish.
- Of course. I'll remember that.

28:47.360 --> 28:51.690
We'll build the best Illustra yet
on that site. And when I move up,

28:51.823 --> 28:56.366
someone will have
to take my place here, huh? Huh?

28:58.038 --> 29:02.534
- I'll be keeping my eye on you, Roxie.
- BJ, BJ, BJ! You won't believe it.

29:02.667 --> 29:06.036
Prince and Company has
the most incredible window.

29:06.546 --> 29:11.007
I'm talking fab. People were
lined up outside to get a peek!

29:11.134 --> 29:13.708
I passed through
on my way from a tanning session.

29:13.845 --> 29:16.597
It's the most amazing thing I've ever seen.

29:17.557 --> 29:20.475
- Really?
- Well, uh...

29:20.602 --> 29:24.814
You know, it...
it really wasn't that great. It was...

29:24.940 --> 29:29.851
Um, it was interesting...
in a jejune way at best.

29:31.947 --> 29:34.568
I didn't care for it myself.

29:35.534 --> 29:37.573
You know...

29:41.248 --> 29:43.739
You should have seen it.
It was beyond brilliant.

29:43.875 --> 29:47.125
There were 20 mannequins, with
tennis rackets coming out of...

29:47.254 --> 29:51.086
Beej, he's just a twerpy stock boy.
That window was a fluke.

29:51.216 --> 29:55.712
Well, when I move up, somebody will
have to take my place here, Richards.

29:55.846 --> 29:59.594
But if you let that stock boy screw things
up, it sure as hell won't be you.

29:59.725 --> 30:04.552
I have worked on this deal too long to
have it ruined by some snot-nosed punk.

30:04.688 --> 30:06.977
I can handle him. I...

30:07.107 --> 30:09.349
I meant you, Richards!

30:09.484 --> 30:13.434
Of course you did, sir. But,
you know, the board meeting is today.

30:13.572 --> 30:16.027
I guarantee the sale will go through.

30:16.158 --> 30:20.369
And Illustra, under your inspired
leadership, will reach new heights.

30:20.495 --> 30:23.911
Richards! Where in the hell
did you learn to kiss ass like that?

30:24.041 --> 30:28.786
- Did you take a class?
- Oh, no, sir, no. That's a God-given gift.

30:29.379 --> 30:31.751
<i>Beej? BJ, are you there?</i>

30:32.340 --> 30:36.919
Mrs Timkin, what possessed Switcher
to create such a window display?

30:37.054 --> 30:40.672
Did you see the crowds gaping on
the sidewalk? It's an embarrassment.

30:46.605 --> 30:48.644
Never you fear. Your Hollywood is here!

30:48.774 --> 30:52.107
Rumour Control has it the board
wants to fire your little behind.

30:52.235 --> 30:55.604
Just let me at those so-and-sos.
I will straighten them out.

30:55.739 --> 30:58.408
- How can they fire you?
- These are business people.

30:58.533 --> 31:00.775
They won't appreciate
an emotional appeal.

31:00.911 --> 31:06.153
You're right. I was hoping to avoid this,
but this is an hour of desperation.

31:06.291 --> 31:08.616
This is not the way
to approach this, OK...

31:08.752 --> 31:11.041
You don't think so?

31:11.588 --> 31:15.502
Don't tell anyone you saw me dressed
like this. I have a reputation to uphold.

31:15.634 --> 31:18.089
Buddy, I appreciate this demonstration...

31:18.220 --> 31:23.214
Oh, that's it! A demonstration!
I will create a media event.

31:23.350 --> 31:25.675
Call the newspapers.
The headline will read,

31:25.811 --> 31:28.515
"If Jonathan is fired, Hollywood flies."

31:28.647 --> 31:31.850
Excuse me while I step out
onto the window ledge.

31:31.983 --> 31:34.142
No. Hollywood!

31:34.277 --> 31:36.235
- Hollywood!
- Whoo! Ooh!

31:36.363 --> 31:38.402
- Come on. Get off!
- Ooh!

31:41.451 --> 31:43.776
- I'm sorry.
- It's OK.

31:43.912 --> 31:45.988
- I get carried away sometimes.
- Not you!

31:46.123 --> 31:48.578
Oh, that Richards!
He gives men a bad name.

31:48.709 --> 31:52.291
- He said he would fix everything for me.
- Mm-hm.

31:53.004 --> 31:57.713
What arrogance! That worm of a stock
boy has affronted the dignity of this store.

31:58.218 --> 32:02.927
I'll have it taken down and make sure that
lunatic never works in this town again.

32:03.056 --> 32:05.215
Shall we move on to the sale to Illustra?

32:05.350 --> 32:10.178
Just a minute, Mr Richards.
I believe we're onto something here.

32:10.313 --> 32:13.517
Maybe people will come to see
our bold new window displays,

32:13.650 --> 32:16.022
and if they come to look,
they'll stay to buy.

32:16.153 --> 32:18.904
With all due respect,
it's a little late for that,

32:19.030 --> 32:21.237
and we do have
the firm offer from Illustra.

32:21.575 --> 32:23.982
For one-tenth the value of the store.

32:24.119 --> 32:27.239
Besides, I can't bear
the thought of selling this place,

32:27.372 --> 32:29.495
especially to that awful BJ Wert.

32:29.958 --> 32:32.663
We know how much
the store means to you, ma'am, but...

32:32.794 --> 32:35.464
Well, ten per cent
is better than bankruptcy.

32:36.214 --> 32:38.254
I think Mrs Timkin is right.

32:38.383 --> 32:40.755
I move we postpone the sale
for six weeks.

32:41.053 --> 32:43.425
- I second the motion.
- All in favour?

32:45.140 --> 32:47.216
All opposed?

32:47.350 --> 32:49.427
This meeting is adjourned.

32:49.561 --> 32:54.472
- Harris, would you bring Mr Switcher in?
- What? No, wait. I think...

32:58.278 --> 33:01.612
Jonathan, good news.
We've not only decided to keep you on,

33:01.740 --> 33:04.694
but I'm promoting you
to visual merchandiser.

33:05.118 --> 33:08.736
You're kidding! That's great! What is it?

33:09.539 --> 33:12.659
Just keep doing what you did last night,
and you'll be fine.

33:12.793 --> 33:15.996
Uh, Mrs Timkin...
I'm not sure I can do it again.

33:17.089 --> 33:19.580
Last night may have been
a one-time inspiration.

33:19.716 --> 33:22.290
Oh, Jonathan, don't doubt yourself.

33:22.427 --> 33:26.472
Go with it. Feel it. You're doing
the job you were meant to do.

33:29.684 --> 33:34.596
Well, you must lead a charmed life. It was
all I could do to save your skin in here.

33:35.690 --> 33:37.979
No thanks are necessary, Switcher.

33:43.573 --> 33:45.613
Oh!

33:51.164 --> 33:53.121
Good evening, Mr Richards, sir.

33:53.667 --> 33:56.870
Felix, that new stock boy,
Switcher, has been promoted.

33:57.003 --> 34:00.254
He'll be doing windows at night.
Keep an eye on him for me.

34:00.632 --> 34:04.844
You suspect pilferage, sir?
I'd be happy to strip-search him.

34:05.929 --> 34:08.135
You people that work at night scare me.

34:08.264 --> 34:11.764
I just want you to let me know
what he's up to, how he works.

34:11.893 --> 34:15.179
Yes, sir. His MO.
Would you like that in a written report?

34:15.897 --> 34:17.937
Oh, you write?

34:19.525 --> 34:22.063
No. Rambo does.

34:24.739 --> 34:26.981
- Just watch him.
- Yes, sir.

34:29.578 --> 34:31.701
Come on, Rambo.

34:31.830 --> 34:35.116
We have got ourselves... a mission.

34:40.589 --> 34:42.628
<i>(sniffs)</i>

34:44.217 --> 34:46.543
Jesus Christ, Rambo!

34:51.016 --> 34:53.388
Hi, it's me. Jonathan. Remember?

34:56.563 --> 34:59.730
Well, I guess
it was just temporary insanity.

35:00.442 --> 35:03.396
- Oh, ye of little faith.
- Emmy! You're back! I thought...

35:03.528 --> 35:07.147
You remind me of my old boyfriend Chris.
He had no confidence.

35:07.282 --> 35:10.318
- Chris? Who's Chris?
- Oh, just a sailor.

35:10.452 --> 35:13.821
I told him that the world was round
and I never saw him again.

35:14.456 --> 35:17.991
Christopher Columbus?
You knew Christopher Columbus?

35:18.710 --> 35:20.204
Uh-huh.

35:20.587 --> 35:22.627
So, you didn't come directly from Edfu?

35:22.964 --> 35:26.333
Oh, no. Along the way
I tried out different times and places.

35:26.468 --> 35:28.876
None of them ever really seemed right.

35:29.012 --> 35:31.966
Oh. You didn't happen
to run into Michelangelo?

35:32.099 --> 35:35.799
Michelangelo. Michelangelo. Oh, yes!

35:35.936 --> 35:41.855
Oh, he wasn't very interested in me.
He was involved with a guy named David.

35:41.983 --> 35:44.023
- Come on!
- Were you there?

35:46.613 --> 35:50.527
Mrs Timkin loved what you did last night,
but... they think I did it.

35:50.659 --> 35:53.150
They want me to do more windows.
You gotta help me.

35:53.286 --> 35:55.030
Of course.

36:01.420 --> 36:03.412
You are magic.

Oh, very nice. Maybe I can get
GI Joe and we can double sometime.

- No. You don't understand.
- Don't say nothing. It's cool.

39:31.963 --> 39:36.127
It's obvious to this country girl
that you're an A No.1 creative freak.

39:36.426 --> 39:39.795
Imagine pretending to be a stock boy
when you're a major artiste!

39:39.930 --> 39:42.468

- Easy, Felix.

40:51.626 --> 40:53.868
I don't think she's armed.

40:59.593 --> 41:02.759
You can fool Rambo,
but it won't work with me, Switcher!

41:09.311 --> 41:13.391
- Well, I think we've outdone ourselves.
- Yeah, this one's kinda fun.

41:14.983 --> 41:17.023
- Ready?
- Let her rip.

41:20.572 --> 41:22.612
Very nice.

41:39.591 --> 41:42.675
- Morning, Mrs T.
- Oh, good morning, Jonathan.

41:42.803 --> 41:45.887
What do you think?
It's hot, huh? I mean, meltdown.

41:46.014 --> 41:50.890
Oh, yes. Hot. Smoking.
Burning, churning. Whatever. Oh, yes!

42:08.036 --> 42:11.121

- Hi, Jonathan.

42:11.248 --> 42:14.830
- It's me, Roxie.
- I thought you weren't talking to me.

42:14.960 --> 42:17.533
I wanted to see you,
to know you're all right.

42:17.671 --> 42:20.162
I gotta get some sleep.
I work nights now, OK?

42:20.674 --> 42:23.081
All right. But get up in time for lunch.

42:23.218 --> 42:28.129
<i>I'm taking you to Chez Jacques</i>
<i>at one o'clock. You know where it is.</i>

42:28.265 --> 42:31.930
Yeah. I was fired from there once.
I almost burned that joint down.

42:32.060 --> 42:36.603
It'll be just like old times.
And please, don't stand me up again.

42:36.732 --> 42:39.187
- OK.
- Bye.

42:43.572 --> 42:45.611
He'll be there.

42:47.659 --> 42:48.774
Love that gal.

42:56.043 --> 42:57.038
Hi, Hans!

42:57.169 --> 43:01.581
I see you're wearing the night-time hair
at lunch now. Looks good.

43:03.508 --> 43:07.292
It's you! The flambé terrorist!

43:07.804 --> 43:10.591
Will you not be satisfied
till you burn the place down?

43:10.724 --> 43:14.591
It was an accident, Hans. Just trying
to show the customer a little flair.

43:14.728 --> 43:16.471
- Jonathan!
- Hi, Roxie.

43:16.605 --> 43:18.811
- You're here to dine?
- That's right.

43:18.940 --> 43:21.776
By the way,
the eyebrows are growing back nice.

43:21.902 --> 43:26.611
- Sorry I'm late. I overslept.
- It's OK. You're only an hour late.

43:26.740 --> 43:28.816
Just glad you made it.

43:28.950 --> 43:31.358
I love this place. It's so romantic.

43:31.495 --> 43:34.282
Yeah. Boy, they did a good job
rebuilding the balcony.

43:34.414 --> 43:36.323
It went up like a Roman candle.

43:36.792 --> 43:39.662
Jonathan, it seems like
I was all wrong about you,

43:39.795 --> 43:42.202
and I have a way of making it up to you.

43:42.339 --> 43:46.039
How would you like to be
the chief window-dresser at Illustra?

43:48.178 --> 43:50.965
- You're kidding.
- Word is out, Jonathan. You're hot.

43:51.098 --> 43:54.383
Can you imagine
being at Illustra? Ooh, Illustra.

43:54.518 --> 43:56.676
- They want me?
- <i>We</i> want you.

43:57.396 --> 43:59.721
Well, what if I told you I had a little help?

43:59.856 --> 44:02.691
Oh, two of you?
Whoever he is, you can bring him along.

44:03.110 --> 44:06.313
And what if I told you
it was a very beautiful woman?

44:07.864 --> 44:12.822
- I... I wouldn't mind. Not in the least.
- I can't do it.

44:12.953 --> 44:15.408
- You'll start Monday.
- You're not listening.

44:15.539 --> 44:19.239
You can drive me to work every day.
I miss that quirky little motorcycle.

44:19.376 --> 44:23.041
- Roxie, I'm not taking the job.
- What? Why not?

44:24.089 --> 44:26.544
If I'm one thing, I'm loyal.

44:26.675 --> 44:29.510
Jonathan, you're not
seriously turning me down?

44:29.636 --> 44:33.005
I'm not the same guy I used to be.
I've found a place where I belong.

44:33.140 --> 44:34.598
I'll see you around.

44:36.977 --> 44:38.139
<i>(screaming)</i>

44:38.270 --> 44:41.140
I'll get it! Don't panic! It's just a little one!

44:46.069 --> 44:48.109
Bye, Roxie.

44:52.325 --> 44:56.275
There's something strange going on
in the store at night, Mr Richards.

44:56.413 --> 44:59.698
Every time Rambo sees a mannequin,
he gets so scared,

44:59.833 --> 45:02.953
his little pug tail
comes right out his little mouth.

45:03.086 --> 45:06.253
- Felix, you were in the war, weren't you?
- Airborne, yes, sir!

45:06.798 --> 45:09.087
Did you jump from a plane
and land on your face?

45:09.509 --> 45:13.341
Yes, sir! I don't see what
this has to do with little Rambo.

45:13.472 --> 45:16.010
Isn't it obvious
Switcher is behind all of this?

45:16.141 --> 45:19.676
- That skunk!
- I mean, a man who is an eternal failure

45:19.811 --> 45:22.516
is putting together
the best window displays in town.

45:22.647 --> 45:24.770
The bum!

45:24.900 --> 45:26.939
You say you hear voices. No one's there.

45:27.069 --> 45:30.272
- Just him and his dummies.
- Is someone helping him?

45:30.405 --> 45:33.276
Is he a ventriloquist?
Some kind of mad genius?

45:34.326 --> 45:36.318
Good questions all, sir.

45:36.870 --> 45:39.824
- Find out the answers!
- Yes, sir!

45:39.956 --> 45:43.076
- What about little Rambo?
- Screw your dog!

45:45.921 --> 45:47.878
<i>(whimpers)</i>

45:49.174 --> 45:52.091
Let's go, people. Clear out.
Clear out, lady!

45:56.181 --> 46:00.760
Come on, Rambo. Tonight we nail
that little fart blossom.

46:04.022 --> 46:06.430
<i>On behalf of Captain Clark and the crew,</i>

46:06.566 --> 46:08.855
<i>thank you for flying with Eastern.</i>

46:08.985 --> 46:12.817
<i>We hope you enjoy</i>
<i>your fun-filled stay in the Caribbean.</i>

46:12.948 --> 46:15.735
<i>(Emmy)</i> Oh, we deserve this vacation.

46:15.867 --> 46:18.074
The sun feels pretty strong.

46:18.203 --> 46:20.409
I could use some suntan lotion,

46:22.249 --> 46:25.369
if someone were willing to rub it on.

46:28.338 --> 46:32.715
Well, it's a dirty job,
but somebody's gotta do it.

47:01.538 --> 47:03.578
We are alone.

47:06.960 --> 47:08.787
OK.

47:08.920 --> 47:13.962
So, listen. We find him, get a picture
of whoever this woman is, and get out.

47:14.092 --> 47:17.841
If we can't hire Jonathan,
maybe at least we can buy her out.

47:19.181 --> 47:22.182
I don't know about you,
but I've always wanted to make love

47:22.309 --> 47:26.353
in the ladies' shoe department.
The smell of fine leather!

47:28.190 --> 47:30.016
Aah!

47:30.150 --> 47:32.522
Can I show you something in your size?

47:33.779 --> 47:36.696
What? You mean you took me serious?

47:49.753 --> 47:51.829
Oh, you're gonna pay for that!

47:52.214 --> 47:54.253
<i>(giggling)</i>

48:00.180 --> 48:02.588
Mayday! Mayday, Rambo.

48:03.308 --> 48:07.258
OK, boy! Oh, baby!
Now, show 'em what you're made of.

48:07.396 --> 48:09.222
- Go get 'em!
- <i>(whimpers)</i>

48:09.356 --> 48:11.681
Rambo! This way!

48:11.817 --> 48:14.355
This means a court martial!

48:17.197 --> 48:20.946
- You hear that? That must be them.
- I wish it was us.

48:21.076 --> 48:23.911
Come on. We've got them.

48:25.997 --> 48:27.705
- Give up?
- Never.

48:28.709 --> 48:30.748
Oh!

48:33.046 --> 48:35.335
Ooh, Switcher.

48:36.258 --> 48:38.583
You are one sick puppy.

48:41.763 --> 48:44.634
So this is the young lady
he dumped you for?

48:45.600 --> 48:47.842
Nice.

48:48.311 --> 48:50.637
Oh, beauteous.

48:50.772 --> 48:53.643
I really should've listened
when he asked me for help.

48:53.984 --> 48:57.684
Ooh! Tell me,
when you were making love to him,

48:58.572 --> 49:01.241
did he ever scream "Don't stop, Woody"?

49:02.784 --> 49:04.991
- Ooh! Aah!
- <i>(crash)</i>

49:05.120 --> 49:06.911
Oh, my camera.

49:07.914 --> 49:12.161
No, this is how I...
get my inspiration, I create.

49:12.294 --> 49:15.211
I can tell by looking at you
you're not the artistic type.

49:15.672 --> 49:18.922
You know, Mr Richards
told me to keep an eye on you.

49:19.051 --> 49:25.385
But I think I'm gonna
handle things my own way.

49:29.728 --> 49:32.017
You wanna move your sweetheart?

49:37.944 --> 49:40.400
That one was for Rambo.

49:54.544 --> 49:56.584
Aah! Switcher!

49:57.005 --> 49:59.710
This is for my mama!

50:05.639 --> 50:07.678
Oh, Switcher.

50:11.019 --> 50:13.095
Ow!

50:16.483 --> 50:20.184
Oh! Switcher, I'm gonna knock you
into the middle of next week!

50:26.660 --> 50:30.325
- How'd you do that?
- I was behind him. He didn't see me.

50:32.457 --> 50:34.746
Teach him to mess with
a man and his mannequin.

50:42.926 --> 50:46.010
Hm. Huh. Hm-hm. Whoo!

51:12.372 --> 51:13.368
Wow!

51:16.668 --> 51:18.708
Hey! Where'd you go?

51:20.881 --> 51:22.920
Emmy!

51:47.491 --> 51:49.530
Emmy!

51:51.411 --> 51:52.407
Emmy!

51:53.413 --> 51:57.874
This is your last chance.
We take him or we die tryin'!

52:36.915 --> 52:40.331
I did it! I flew! I really flew!

52:40.836 --> 52:44.501
- Are you all right?
- Terrific! Incredible! I feel great!

52:44.631 --> 52:46.671
Did you see how high I was?

52:51.763 --> 52:53.970
- I just had a thought.
- Hm?

52:54.099 --> 52:57.219
You think we should name
our first kid Pinocchio?

53:02.816 --> 53:07.063
Jonathan, are you really sure
this is right for you?

53:07.195 --> 53:09.235
I'm positive.

53:10.198 --> 53:13.402
What about you?
You've waited a long time.

53:13.910 --> 53:17.611
How do you know you're not missing
something better 5,000 years from now?

53:17.748 --> 53:21.199
There could never be anything
better than being here with you.

53:21.334 --> 53:25.202
This is one guy
who's never gonna leave your side.

53:27.507 --> 53:29.547
The window!

53:32.971 --> 53:35.011
Come on, come on.

53:40.937 --> 53:44.389
- It's almost sunrise. We can't finish.
- Don't worry about a thing.

53:44.524 --> 53:46.980
We'll never dress the mannequins in time.

53:48.153 --> 53:50.192
That's right.

54:06.713 --> 54:10.129
Absolutely scintillating. Beyond genius.

54:10.258 --> 54:12.298
It sucks.

54:12.427 --> 54:14.467
Fool.

54:26.358 --> 54:28.397
<i>(snoring)</i>

54:30.320 --> 54:33.238
Well, I don't believe it's lunch yet.
Let's not dally.

54:36.702 --> 54:38.741
Felix!

54:40.706 --> 54:43.956
- What happened?
- Well, why don't you tell me?

54:44.292 --> 54:47.293
- Where's Rambo?
<i>- (whimpers)</i>

54:47.629 --> 54:53.134
It's that Switcher. I caught him doing
awful things to a half-naked dummy.

54:53.260 --> 54:55.548
Is this your idea of a security guard?

54:55.679 --> 54:59.593
- Claire, I assure you, I had nothing...
- You hired him, you fire him.

54:59.725 --> 55:02.013
Well, what if he's telling the truth?

55:02.519 --> 55:04.844
How can you think that?

55:04.980 --> 55:08.396
The man is a lunatic,
but I've never known him to lie.

55:08.525 --> 55:09.805
He's right.

55:09.943 --> 55:13.063
Mr Richards, this store has
never been more successful

55:13.196 --> 55:15.236
and it's all due to Jonathan Switcher.

55:15.365 --> 55:18.864
He can put a rubber glove on his head
and run naked through the store,

55:18.994 --> 55:22.529
- yelling "Hi, I'm a squid!"
- Hi. Morning, Mrs T.

55:22.664 --> 55:24.704
Oh, hello, Jonathan.

55:24.833 --> 55:27.869
This morning's window
is your most brilliant yet.

55:28.003 --> 55:31.953
- Thank you. What happened here?
- God only knows.

55:32.340 --> 55:35.591
Felix, did you try and take Omaha beach
all by yourself again?

55:35.719 --> 55:38.755
- I was doing what Mr Richards told me.
- I never said...

55:38.889 --> 55:40.348
Oh, is that right?

55:40.474 --> 55:44.008
Well, Richards, when you take Felix
to get his last paycheck,

55:44.144 --> 55:46.018
get your own as well.

55:46.146 --> 55:49.230
Uh, Mrs Timkin,
you may be our grande dame,

55:49.357 --> 55:54.103
but I've had serious doubts about
a woman your age running this store.

55:54.237 --> 55:58.235
- I'll appeal to the board.
- I can't see you appealing to anybody.

55:58.366 --> 56:02.234
Don't mess with this old chick, mister.
Just pack it up!

56:02.371 --> 56:04.410
Jonathan, let's go.

56:05.791 --> 56:08.708
Get that dog outta the tree, huh?

56:09.002 --> 56:13.249
Hey! You can't do this!
We'll file a grievance with the union!

56:13.382 --> 56:16.051
We're not in a union, you idiot.

57:02.280 --> 57:05.980
Oh, hi there, Jonathan.
I didn't know you were in there.

57:06.117 --> 57:08.904
- Excuse me.
- Oh, that's lovely.

57:09.996 --> 57:11.075
Mm-hm.

57:21.716 --> 57:24.468
<i>(Wert)</i> What the hell
are you people doing, huh?

57:24.844 --> 57:28.545
Have you seen the latest figures,
children, huh? Huh? Have you?

57:28.681 --> 57:33.308
<i>89</i> per cent! Sales are down <i>89</i> per cent!

57:34.604 --> 57:37.356
Prince and Company
is going through the roof!

57:37.482 --> 57:41.016
All right.
Now, I want this to stop, children.

57:41.152 --> 57:43.857
And if it doesn't, so help me, God,

57:43.988 --> 57:46.028
you are all dead meat!

57:48.368 --> 57:52.235
Jonathan, it is my honour to inform you
that, starting Monday morning,

57:52.372 --> 57:55.871
you will be the youngest vice president
ever at Prince and Company.

57:56.000 --> 57:58.491
- Congratulations.
- <i>(all)</i> Hear, hear.

58:01.297 --> 58:03.871
- I don't know what to say.
- Say "Thank you."

58:04.008 --> 58:07.709
- Thank you. Thank you!
- Long live Prince and... Company.

58:08.721 --> 58:10.714
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

58:12.892 --> 58:14.932
Son of a gun.

58:15.061 --> 58:17.350
So, Richards was telling the truth.

58:18.189 --> 58:20.431
I've been in this business 20 years.

58:20.566 --> 58:24.730
Hell, half the guys in this store
probably wear lace underwear.

58:24.862 --> 58:26.902
But this!

58:27.448 --> 58:31.398
We're talking a Sunday drive
into some serious dementia.

58:31.536 --> 58:33.575
Well.

58:35.707 --> 58:39.040
- It's our move now.
- BJ, I would do anything for Illustra,

58:39.168 --> 58:43.296
but these pictures,
they could kind of ruin his life.

58:43.881 --> 58:46.254
Roxie, I'd never ruin anyone's life.

58:47.302 --> 58:50.421
Well, I would,
but only if it were absolutely necessary.

58:50.555 --> 58:54.173
Now, Roxie, you're not developing
a conscience on me, are you?

58:54.309 --> 58:56.348
No. I don't think so.

58:57.312 --> 59:00.846
Good. Anyway, I don't wanna ruin his life.

59:01.858 --> 59:04.609
I just wanna hire him, and, uh...

59:07.113 --> 59:09.438
now I know how.

59:11.492 --> 59:13.532
Hey, Gordon.

59:20.418 --> 59:23.419
- Oh, Mrs Thomas. Hi.
- Please, Jonathan. It's all yours.

59:23.546 --> 59:27.626
- Thanks. Men's room's broken.
- Of course, dear. Whatever you say.

59:27.759 --> 59:30.047
- Oh, congratulations.
- Thank you.

59:36.100 --> 59:40.264
You won't believe what Mrs Timkin
and the board just told me.

59:40.396 --> 59:44.145
- Vice president.
- Oh! Jonathan, that's wonderful!

59:44.275 --> 59:47.312
Tina! Lupe!
He's talking to the dummy again.

59:51.032 --> 59:54.483
Nobody deserves it more. I knew
something like this would happen.

59:54.619 --> 01:00:00.075
Creative freedom, practically my own
boss. Maybe some World Series tickets.

01:00:01.125 --> 01:00:04.909
I'm sorry. I'm going on and on.
You know I couldn't do this without you.

01:00:05.046 --> 01:00:07.715
I won't take the job
unless we can be together.

01:00:07.840 --> 01:00:12.467
Jonathan, you can't worry
about what will happen to us.

01:00:14.180 --> 01:00:16.220
What does that mean?

01:00:24.857 --> 01:00:26.897
Girls, please, let's not be catty.

01:00:27.026 --> 01:00:30.229
I will not tolerate eavesdropping
unless I'm a part of it.

01:00:30.363 --> 01:00:32.320
I assume my Jonathan is in there.

01:00:32.448 --> 01:00:35.864
You can't go in. He's got company,
if you know what I mean.

01:00:35.994 --> 01:00:38.864
And who do you think introduced them?

01:00:47.046 --> 01:00:51.589
- She'll never say your hips are too fat.
- Oh, Hollywood! Jeez! Listen...

01:00:53.052 --> 01:00:57.465
You know I would never bother you
when you're getting a piece of wood.

01:00:57.598 --> 01:01:00.516
But this is <i>muy importante.</i>
Your Hollywood needs help.

01:01:00.643 --> 01:01:03.728
- Oh, what's up?
- I need your creative muse.

01:01:04.230 --> 01:01:08.394
I've always thought of myself as hot stuff.
The very, very best at what I do.

01:01:08.526 --> 01:01:11.895
But seeing you... Let's just say it. I am dirt.

01:01:12.280 --> 01:01:15.696
Mould me. Shape me. I'm a fast learner.

01:01:16.117 --> 01:01:20.696
Oh, please, Jonathan. Do not let them
turn me out into that dark night, alone.

01:01:20.830 --> 01:01:23.831
Hollywood, we can talk
about designs and stuff,

01:01:23.958 --> 01:01:26.117
but when I work, I gotta work alone.

01:01:27.045 --> 01:01:29.500
Of course. I understand perfectly.

01:01:30.381 --> 01:01:34.842
You're an artiste, and that's
the way you work. I can respect that.

01:01:37.680 --> 01:01:40.717
Jesus. Hollywood, listen. Don't worry.

01:01:40.850 --> 01:01:44.764
You can work as long as you want here.
I'm a vice president now.

01:01:52.070 --> 01:01:55.355
- Who's crying?
- It's either our new vice president,

01:01:55.490 --> 01:01:57.363
the fairy, or the dummy.

01:01:57.492 --> 01:01:59.698
<i>(wailing)</i>

01:02:00.411 --> 01:02:03.614
Emmy, please. You gotta help me.

01:02:03.748 --> 01:02:08.077
I can't come alive in front of Hollywood.
Besides, you can do it on your own.

01:02:08.211 --> 01:02:10.666
But we're a team.
We do everything together.

01:02:10.797 --> 01:02:16.752
You can't hold yourself back because of
me. Now come on. Hollywood's waiting.

01:02:16.886 --> 01:02:19.258
You'll do a masterpiece tonight.

01:02:19.389 --> 01:02:21.677
Emmy...

01:02:24.811 --> 01:02:26.850
I'll be waiting in the window.

01:02:34.362 --> 01:02:38.276
Jonathan, how about a picture.
Mom will think I've switched.

01:02:41.786 --> 01:02:44.953
- Hollywood, you're a genius.
- I am? Well, yes!

01:02:45.081 --> 01:02:48.248
- OK, we need to make a list.
- Fire away.

01:02:48.376 --> 01:02:53.168
- Uh, 30 feet of black nylon cord.
- Ow! Sounds like my kinda list!

01:02:53.297 --> 01:02:55.337
Easy, sugar. Uh... OK.

01:02:56.217 --> 01:02:58.423
You personally vouch for this guy?

01:02:58.928 --> 01:03:02.677
He's worked at Prince and Company
for 15 years. I think he'll be just fine.

01:03:02.807 --> 01:03:05.013
I mean, he's an imbecile, but...

01:03:06.227 --> 01:03:08.350
Oh, this is him.

01:03:08.479 --> 01:03:12.691
Felix, come in. This is Mr BJ Wert.

01:03:12.817 --> 01:03:15.355
Well, Mr Wert, sir!

01:03:16.571 --> 01:03:17.733
It's fine.

01:03:17.864 --> 01:03:21.529
Felix, there are hundreds of mannequins
at Prince and Company.

01:03:21.659 --> 01:03:28.373
Could you identify the one Jonathan
Switcher has a... romantic interest in?

01:03:28.499 --> 01:03:32.579
Oh, absolutely, sir. I never forget
a name or a face, Mr Nertz.

01:03:33.546 --> 01:03:36.915
Good. Well, Felix, we need your help.

01:03:37.050 --> 01:03:42.127
And if you succeed, you will have
a cushy new job, right here at Illustra.

01:03:42.263 --> 01:03:47.506
We want to get Switcher's mannequin out
of the store and bring her here, secretly.

01:03:48.811 --> 01:03:52.856
Oh! A covert operation.

01:03:53.858 --> 01:03:57.441
I would be happy and proud
to lead this mission, sir.

01:03:57.820 --> 01:03:58.816
Good!

01:04:34.440 --> 01:04:37.227
It's the most beautiful
window I've ever seen.

01:04:37.360 --> 01:04:39.981
- It's all you, you know.
- Not this time.

01:04:40.113 --> 01:04:43.564
Every time. You're part of me now.
I've got you in here.

01:04:46.619 --> 01:04:48.778
Come on. You ready to go?

01:04:48.913 --> 01:04:51.784
- Are you really sure you wanna do this?
- Absolutely.

01:04:51.916 --> 01:04:55.581
You've been cooped up in the store
too long. Who cares what people think?

01:04:55.962 --> 01:04:59.378
Just put your arms around me
and hold on tight.

01:04:59.507 --> 01:05:01.250
With pleasure.

01:05:05.555 --> 01:05:08.010
Jonathan!

01:05:08.141 --> 01:05:10.347
Look, Jonathan, I...

01:05:10.476 --> 01:05:13.726
- I know about your problem.
- What problem?

01:05:13.855 --> 01:05:17.140
You're riding around town
with a mannequin on your motorcycle.

01:05:17.275 --> 01:05:19.314
What is wrong with this picture?

01:05:19.861 --> 01:05:23.775
Oh, right. You two haven't met.
Roxie, this is Emmy. Emmy, Roxie.

01:05:24.115 --> 01:05:26.784
Nice to meet...
Oh, my God. What am I saying?

01:05:26.909 --> 01:05:31.038
Jonathan, I wanna give you one
last chance. Now, come to Illustra!

01:05:31.164 --> 01:05:34.165
What is in this for you, Roxie?
An office with a view?

01:05:34.292 --> 01:05:39.333
I don't need Illustra. Or you.
I got friends here, people who care.

01:05:39.964 --> 01:05:43.167
And someone who makes me
feel good about myself.

01:05:43.301 --> 01:05:45.756
Bye, Roxie.

01:05:46.512 --> 01:05:49.597
- Whoo-hoo-hoo!
- You'll be sorry!

01:05:49.724 --> 01:05:51.681
You're making a big mistake!

01:05:51.809 --> 01:05:53.968
Roxie.

01:05:54.103 --> 01:05:56.773
He's out of his mind! BJ was right.

01:05:56.898 --> 01:05:59.649
When I get that dummy,
I'm gonna tear her hair out!

01:05:59.817 --> 01:06:03.945
Roxie, Roxie, Roxie.
You know what you need to do right now?

01:06:04.072 --> 01:06:07.156
You need to put him and
this nasty affair out of your mind.

01:06:07.283 --> 01:06:10.901
Now, how is the best way
to do that? Huh? Huh?

01:06:11.037 --> 01:06:14.121
By having a night of distasteable sex

01:06:14.248 --> 01:06:16.953
with someone you care
absolutely nothing about.

01:06:17.085 --> 01:06:20.454
And proudly,
I would like to be that person.

01:06:20.588 --> 01:06:22.664
Fine. Let's just go to your place.

01:06:22.799 --> 01:06:26.168
- Really?
- Drive fast before I have second thoughts.

01:06:28.972 --> 01:06:31.427
Armand is the wind.

01:06:37.271 --> 01:06:40.937
Hey, Mr Richards. You better
put some camouflage on, sir.

01:06:41.067 --> 01:06:44.436
I am not going to put shoe polish
on my face, thank you.

01:06:45.279 --> 01:06:47.687
Now could we please
get into the store, Felix?

01:06:48.366 --> 01:06:50.405
Yes, sir.

01:06:53.329 --> 01:06:57.030
- Oh! Look at him with the dummy.
- Who are you to criticise?

01:07:01.295 --> 01:07:06.088
It's him! It's her! Ooh, that little prevert!
He's stealing her before we can!

01:07:06.217 --> 01:07:10.345
Let's not do anything rash. We'll follow
and find the right moment to grab her.

01:07:10.471 --> 01:07:13.508
Don't worry. I'm an expert at surveillance.

01:07:13.641 --> 01:07:15.598
Hang on!

01:07:18.730 --> 01:07:21.018
- Where'd he go?
- That way. That way.

01:07:28.072 --> 01:07:31.239
That is it!
No more of this surveillance crap.

01:07:32.035 --> 01:07:35.617
Captain Felix Maxwell
takes this from no mannequin.

01:07:39.334 --> 01:07:42.916
Ah! Get us out of here
before he gets out of the car!

01:07:44.881 --> 01:07:47.668
- Hang on!
- I'm gonna die. I'm gonna die.

01:07:53.014 --> 01:07:54.923
You're finished, Switcher!

01:08:03.775 --> 01:08:06.776
You may as well
hang up your jockey strap!

01:08:08.821 --> 01:08:12.071
No! No, Mr Richards! No!

01:08:23.961 --> 01:08:26.535
- One-way street, you maniac!
- I know!

01:08:33.179 --> 01:08:35.171
This is for you, Rambo!

01:08:45.692 --> 01:08:47.731
- We got him!
- I want to get out.

01:08:47.859 --> 01:08:50.268
- Geronimo!
- I want to get out.

01:09:04.877 --> 01:09:06.917
Oh!

01:09:07.796 --> 01:09:12.506
I don't understand it. This never
happened to Armand before, never!

01:09:14.220 --> 01:09:16.711
It must be you. You're so cold.

01:09:16.848 --> 01:09:18.924
You're so... so unfeeling.

01:09:20.518 --> 01:09:22.558
Where can I get a mannequin too?

01:09:22.979 --> 01:09:23.975
<i>(door slams)</i>

01:09:24.104 --> 01:09:25.895
<i>(sobs)</i>

01:10:31.756 --> 01:10:33.795
<i>(giggling)</i>

01:10:40.598 --> 01:10:42.638
<i>(sighs)</i>

01:10:48.982 --> 01:10:51.021
Jonathan.

01:10:59.534 --> 01:11:01.573
What are you thinking about?

01:11:02.870 --> 01:11:05.243
- The window.
- Mm.

01:11:05.373 --> 01:11:08.243
It turned out pretty well, didn't it?

01:11:08.376 --> 01:11:10.415
It was breathtaking.

01:11:11.295 --> 01:11:13.335
Emmy.

01:11:14.048 --> 01:11:18.295
Ema Hesire, you inspire me.

01:11:20.847 --> 01:11:22.886
I feel like I could do anything.

01:11:24.475 --> 01:11:26.515
Windows are only the start.

01:11:27.979 --> 01:11:30.434
I think we could design an entire city.

01:11:31.941 --> 01:11:36.402
No one takes the time to build things
that have character, dignity.

01:11:37.322 --> 01:11:39.361
People need that.

01:11:40.116 --> 01:11:42.156
We could give it to them.

01:11:44.245 --> 01:11:46.617
I love you, Emmy.

01:11:47.623 --> 01:11:49.663
I love you too, Jonathan.

01:11:55.298 --> 01:11:57.337
I'd better get into the window.

01:12:29.666 --> 01:12:33.497
That peckerhead doubled back on me.
I saw his motorcycle out front.

01:12:33.628 --> 01:12:35.834
That dummy of his has got to be here.

01:12:45.640 --> 01:12:48.131
Oh!

01:12:48.601 --> 01:12:51.436
- This is the one! This is the one!
- You positive?

01:12:51.562 --> 01:12:53.638
Abso-tively.

01:12:53.773 --> 01:12:56.857
Wait a minute.
This one kinda looks like her too.

01:12:59.696 --> 01:13:02.732
I've put my future
in the hands of a vegetable.

01:13:04.325 --> 01:13:07.611
Just get the mannequin.
Get... get the mannequin.

01:13:23.177 --> 01:13:26.178
- <i>(Felix)</i> It's over there.
- <i>(Richards)</i> No, this is the door.

01:13:26.306 --> 01:13:28.879
This is not the door. Oh, this <i>is</i> the door.

01:13:30.852 --> 01:13:35.229
Oh, wait. Mr Richards, did you ever
notice how they all sorta look alike?

01:13:35.356 --> 01:13:37.396
Would you just look at that one?

01:13:38.568 --> 01:13:40.607
Maybe this is her.

01:13:55.126 --> 01:13:57.083
It's really interesting.

01:13:57.211 --> 01:14:01.292
- It's clever, all right.
- This is art.

01:14:01.424 --> 01:14:04.211
- It's like theatre.
- I get it. I get it.

01:14:16.606 --> 01:14:18.931
Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me.

01:14:21.819 --> 01:14:24.393
Good morning, starshine.
I sleep alone too,

01:14:24.530 --> 01:14:27.401
- but I don't advertise it.
- Could you get my clothes?

01:14:27.533 --> 01:14:30.203
Were you here all night?
You musta slept through it.

01:14:30.328 --> 01:14:32.367
- What?
- <i>(hums "Dragnet" theme)</i>

01:14:32.497 --> 01:14:36.162
All the girl mannequins disappeared
from the windows last night.

01:14:36.292 --> 01:14:38.783
Yes, my dear, your favourite,
she is gone too.

01:14:38.920 --> 01:14:39.999
Emmy.

01:14:41.381 --> 01:14:43.706
Jonathan. Jonathan!

01:14:50.640 --> 01:14:54.638
I'm sorry, baby. But us special people
are destined for heartache sometime.

01:14:54.769 --> 01:14:58.019
You know what works best for me?
Crying shamelessly. Oh!

01:14:58.147 --> 01:15:01.184
Don't do anything drastic. Oh me, oh my!

01:15:12.495 --> 01:15:15.282
OK, now. Wait. Wait a minute.

01:15:16.457 --> 01:15:18.497
Yes, I shall cover you.

01:15:19.794 --> 01:15:21.834
Whoo!

01:15:23.131 --> 01:15:25.752
Yes. This is... Whoa!

01:15:25.883 --> 01:15:28.042
Yes, indeed, oh, yes, girl!

01:15:29.137 --> 01:15:32.802
Mm-hm. Jonathan! Jonathan! Wait!

01:15:33.725 --> 01:15:36.298
- Roxie? Roxie Shield?
- Can I help you?

01:15:36.436 --> 01:15:38.559
- Roxie Shield.
- She's in the boardroom.

01:15:38.688 --> 01:15:42.271
- Thank you!
- You can't go in there! Security!

01:15:44.360 --> 01:15:47.361
Jonathan! Well, we were
hoping you might drop in.

01:15:47.488 --> 01:15:50.525
- Can I get you something to drink?
- Where is she, Roxie?

01:15:50.992 --> 01:15:56.579
She's perfectly safe. Jonathan, let's
talk about your future here at Illustra.

01:15:56.706 --> 01:16:00.324
I think it'll be wonderful
to have the whole team back together.

01:16:00.460 --> 01:16:03.496
- What'd you do with her?
- Relax. It's just a mannequin.

01:16:03.629 --> 01:16:06.915
How does 55,000 a year sound to you?

01:16:07.050 --> 01:16:10.086
- You...
- Hey, hey, hey, hey! All right! 60,000.

01:16:10.219 --> 01:16:12.793
Beej, I don't think
this man is of Illustra fibre.

01:16:12.930 --> 01:16:14.970
- Where is she?
- You won't see her again.

01:16:15.099 --> 01:16:18.053
- Where are you going?
- We also have a profit-sharing...

01:16:18.186 --> 01:16:22.598
Switcher, we have extremely
incriminating photos of you and that...

01:16:23.483 --> 01:16:25.771
Well, get up, Richards! Get him!

01:16:26.486 --> 01:16:28.146
Hey!

01:16:30.698 --> 01:16:32.276
Sorry. Gotta run.

01:16:33.660 --> 01:16:37.953
Security alert! Man in leather jacket!
Hey, come on! Get...

01:16:46.422 --> 01:16:49.092
<i>All units, code two.</i>
<i>Perpetrator on main floor.</i>

01:16:49.217 --> 01:16:52.004
Roger. Over and out.
Come on, Terminator.

01:16:52.136 --> 01:16:54.176
Duty calls.

01:16:57.767 --> 01:16:59.843
Excuse me.

01:17:00.395 --> 01:17:02.019
Roxie!

01:17:04.857 --> 01:17:07.183
- Call the police!
- The SWAT team.

01:17:15.118 --> 01:17:17.157
- Oh! Hey!
- Go away.

01:17:22.917 --> 01:17:25.289
- Felix!
- Oh, Switcher.

01:17:26.129 --> 01:17:29.379
Terminator, lunchtime.

01:17:32.385 --> 01:17:34.212
Get him!

01:17:35.263 --> 01:17:37.302
- Nice dog.
- Shit!

01:17:41.894 --> 01:17:45.061
Switcher! Switcher!

01:18:25.730 --> 01:18:28.565
You're finished, Switcher!

01:18:36.616 --> 01:18:40.863
Hey, Switcher!

01:18:48.002 --> 01:18:50.707
Get me out of here! Get me out of here!

01:19:14.612 --> 01:19:18.776
Watch it!
Put me down! Put me down, you idiots!

01:19:29.711 --> 01:19:33.958
Switcher! I'm gonna get you, Switcher!

01:19:42.140 --> 01:19:44.298
You're finished, Switcher.

01:20:05.913 --> 01:20:08.404
Yoo-hoo! Boys!

01:20:14.964 --> 01:20:16.873
Way to go, buddy!

01:20:17.008 --> 01:20:21.088
Two things I love to do. That's fight
and kiss boys. Come on, honey!

01:20:27.685 --> 01:20:30.722
Come and get me, Sister Maryella!
What's the matter, honey?

01:20:30.855 --> 01:20:33.524
What's the matter? Come on! Whoo-hoo!

01:20:47.538 --> 01:20:51.488
Whoo! This is what
being a man is all about, honey. Oh, yeah!

01:20:55.672 --> 01:20:57.794
Hey! You can't come in here.

01:21:02.136 --> 01:21:04.176
Emmy!

01:21:05.306 --> 01:21:07.595
Mine's bigger than yours is!

01:22:00.320 --> 01:22:03.486
When can we get
that damned water turned off?

01:22:08.494 --> 01:22:09.905
Oh, shit.

01:22:11.289 --> 01:22:13.495
Go!

01:22:15.460 --> 01:22:16.705
Just shoot him!

01:22:19.547 --> 01:22:22.998
- Jonathan. You saved me.
- Oh, it's nothing, really.

01:22:26.262 --> 01:22:28.302
- I'm alive.
- What?

01:22:29.515 --> 01:22:32.185
He can see me and I'm still alive!

01:22:32.310 --> 01:22:34.053
You are!

01:22:34.187 --> 01:22:36.475
Thank you! Thank you.

01:22:38.191 --> 01:22:42.817
- You're gonna have to love me forever.
- Oh, I always have, I always will.

01:22:57.293 --> 01:23:00.413
Get out of the way, doofus! Damn it!

01:23:13.810 --> 01:23:16.217
It's a miracle. A miracle!

01:23:21.317 --> 01:23:23.642
Ugh!

01:23:23.778 --> 01:23:25.237
Stop it! Ugh!

01:23:31.995 --> 01:23:36.455
Ugh! Little creep! Stop! Stop touching me!

01:23:36.582 --> 01:23:38.741
Ugh! Get away from me!

01:23:38.876 --> 01:23:40.916
Please don't touch me! Ugh!

01:23:43.089 --> 01:23:45.128
Roxie.

01:23:48.845 --> 01:23:51.632
- Jesus, it's the heat!
- Hollywood.

01:23:51.764 --> 01:23:53.804
Now, this is Emmy.

01:23:54.684 --> 01:23:59.476
Mama, put the coins on my eyes,
cos I sure don't believe what I am seeing.

01:24:00.523 --> 01:24:03.809
There he is. Arrest that man.

01:24:04.652 --> 01:24:06.894
- Who's she?
- She's who I came for.

01:24:07.030 --> 01:24:09.106
She's the dummy!

01:24:09.240 --> 01:24:11.446
<i>(Wert)</i> I said, arrest that man!

01:24:11.576 --> 01:24:15.159
- Keep your hands off him.
- Claire, thank goodness you're here.

01:24:15.288 --> 01:24:16.616
Oh, shut up.

01:24:16.748 --> 01:24:19.155
BJ, you really screwed up.

01:24:19.292 --> 01:24:23.954
- Claire, what are you talkin' about?
- When I fired this idiot the other day,

01:24:24.088 --> 01:24:27.457
I replaced him with a fancy
camera surveillance system.

01:24:27.592 --> 01:24:30.795
I have Richards
and this moron on videotape.

01:24:30.928 --> 01:24:34.179
I was sure you were behind this.
You... you greedy snake!

01:24:34.307 --> 01:24:36.098
Claire!

01:24:36.225 --> 01:24:39.844
I want those two arrested
for breaking and entering and grand theft.

01:24:39.979 --> 01:24:44.392
- And I'll get you later for conspiracy.
- And you can add kidnapping to that, too.

01:24:44.525 --> 01:24:46.648
- Kidnapping? Who?
- Me.

01:24:46.778 --> 01:24:49.944
- Who are you?
- She's the dummy!

01:24:50.448 --> 01:24:52.606
This poor man is having a breakdown!

01:24:52.742 --> 01:24:55.659
- Get him outta here!
- No, no, she's the dummy!

01:24:55.787 --> 01:24:57.530
- No! No!
- I... Please.

01:24:57.664 --> 01:25:00.237
- She's the dummy!
- Please don't use force.

01:25:00.375 --> 01:25:02.414
Mama! I want my mama!

01:25:02.543 --> 01:25:08.214
Mrs Timkin, those video cameras.
Did they pick up everything last night?

01:25:08.341 --> 01:25:10.630
I only saw what I needed to see!

01:25:12.387 --> 01:25:17.214
- Just where did you come from?
- Uh, Roxie, you would never understand.

01:25:21.145 --> 01:25:22.343
Mm-hm.

01:25:22.772 --> 01:25:28.015
Uh, Claire, there must be some
arrangement we can make, huh?

01:25:28.152 --> 01:25:30.560
Cram it, clown.

01:25:30.697 --> 01:25:32.773
- Come on.
- Oh, no, boys. Please!

01:25:32.907 --> 01:25:35.694
You know, I see executive potential here.

01:25:35.827 --> 01:25:39.077
Roxie, you're fired!
You'll never work in this town again.
