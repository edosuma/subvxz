WEBVTT

00:06.443 --> 00:09.146
Heavy fighting continues
today in Northern Iraq,

00:09.147 --> 00:12.382
as Kurdish Peshmerga
try to dislodge fighters

00:12.383 --> 00:14.117
from the so-called Islamic State, or ISIS,

00:14.118 --> 00:17.588
from areas around the
oil-rich city of Kirkuk.

00:17.589 --> 00:20.057
A delegation from the newly
created government of Iraq

00:20.058 --> 00:21.425
has arrived in the Capitol.

00:21.426 --> 00:22.659
They'll be meeting

00:22.660 --> 00:24.361
with Secretary of State Elizabeth McCord

00:24.362 --> 00:26.129
before moving on to the White House

00:26.130 --> 00:29.900
to appeal for more help in
their fight against the insurgent

00:29.901 --> 00:31.768
Sunni Islamist group ISIS.

00:31.769 --> 00:33.270
Their request comes

00:33.271 --> 00:36.273
against the backdrop of insurgent gains

00:36.274 --> 00:38.041
in the Anbar Province,

00:38.042 --> 00:39.876
the scene of some of the heaviest fighting

00:39.877 --> 00:43.513
during the U.S.'s ten-year
engagement in Iraq.

00:43.514 --> 00:45.649
Marines took heavy losses
in two separate battles

00:45.650 --> 00:47.751
to wrest control of Fallujah

00:47.752 --> 00:49.586
from Sunni insurgents in 2004,

00:49.587 --> 00:52.088
but now the city is
effectively ruled by ISIS.

00:52.928 --> 00:56.159
President Dalton is reportedly
weighing whether to redeploy

00:56.160 --> 00:58.662
U.S. troops in what the
administration insists...

00:58.663 --> 00:59.663
Morning.

00:59.664 --> 01:01.131
Hey.

01:01.132 --> 01:02.799
Uh-oh.

01:02.800 --> 01:05.702
The Serious Mom face.

01:05.703 --> 01:08.939
- No.
- So, uh...

01:08.940 --> 01:12.943
be honest, how worried
should I be about ISIS?

01:12.944 --> 01:15.312
You let me worry about ISIS.

01:15.313 --> 01:18.048
You worry about getting
your dad up at 7:00.

01:18.049 --> 01:20.283
- He's got a flight to catch.
- All right, fine.

01:20.284 --> 01:21.618
Keep your walls up.

01:21.619 --> 01:23.853
What are you talking about?

01:23.854 --> 01:26.022
We talk about stuff all the time.

01:26.023 --> 01:27.257
What are you doing today?

01:27.258 --> 01:29.225
Work, obviously.

01:29.226 --> 01:31.061
Oh. Right.

01:31.062 --> 01:32.996
So, do they have a, um,

01:32.997 --> 01:35.031
a dress code there, or is it...

01:35.032 --> 01:36.466
- Mom!
- What?

01:36.467 --> 01:38.735
Okay, okay, I will let it go,

01:38.736 --> 01:41.805
because you have a really big
day with the Iraqis, but...

01:41.806 --> 01:43.706
just for the sake of world peace,

01:43.707 --> 01:47.043
can you please promise me that
you'll be a little bit less

01:47.044 --> 01:48.645
passive-aggressive when you talk to them?

01:48.646 --> 01:51.381
That outfit just doesn't say
"front of the house” to me.

01:51.382 --> 01:52.982
There... all aggressive, no passive.

01:52.983 --> 01:55.251
- Mom, I know what I'm doing. I mean...
- I know.

01:55.252 --> 01:57.453
- You look very cute.
- Thank you.

01:57.454 --> 01:59.322
Just a little casual.

01:59.323 --> 02:00.089
Stop.

02:00.090 --> 02:02.157
Stopping.

02:06.863 --> 02:08.798
Good morning, ma'am.

02:08.799 --> 02:10.532
Normally, I'm the first one in,

02:10.533 --> 02:13.035
but this is the... fifth day in a row

02:13.036 --> 02:14.504
you've gotten here before me.

02:14.505 --> 02:17.740
Just prepping my remarks
for the Iraqi delegation.

02:17.741 --> 02:19.809
Isn't that mostly a photo op?

02:19.810 --> 02:21.911
Is there something wrong
with what Matt worked up?

02:21.912 --> 02:24.646
Can I help you with something, Nadine?

02:25.414 --> 02:27.650
I know you've been getting here early

02:27.651 --> 02:29.619
to investigate Secretary Marsh.

02:29.620 --> 02:31.821
There was very little about him

02:31.822 --> 02:33.689
that I didn't know, so...

02:33.690 --> 02:35.357
maybe I could help you.

02:35.358 --> 02:37.725
All right.

02:39.195 --> 02:41.530
Why, on the last day of his life,

02:41.531 --> 02:44.433
did he change his itinerary
and fly to Venezuela?

02:44.434 --> 02:47.503
He said he had family business to tend to.

02:47.504 --> 02:49.872
Could that have been a
cover for something else?

02:49.873 --> 02:53.442
Maybe something about his
plans to run for president?

02:53.443 --> 02:55.511
Maybe he was meeting with future donors

02:55.512 --> 02:57.546
or fundr...

02:57.547 --> 03:01.283
Oh, Nadine, I'm...

03:01.284 --> 03:03.985
I'm really sorry.

03:07.022 --> 03:09.691
You're certain he was planning to run?

03:09.692 --> 03:11.659
Yeah.

03:12.294 --> 03:14.730
Well...

03:14.731 --> 03:16.899
I don't know why he went to Venezuela,

03:16.900 --> 03:19.902
other than what he told me...
which was probably a lie.

03:19.903 --> 03:22.770
And I'm certainly a fool, so...

03:24.640 --> 03:27.509
...I suppose I can't help you after all.

03:27.510 --> 03:29.910
Excuse me.

03:32.514 --> 03:34.054
Every six months, there's
a protocol breakfast

03:34.055 --> 03:35.721
- for the new Foreign Service officers...
- Uh-huh.

03:35.722 --> 03:36.640
...where they learn the food etiquette

03:36.641 --> 03:37.913
- of their new postings.
- Wow.

03:37.914 --> 03:39.833
Seems like a solid use of taxpayer dollars.

03:39.834 --> 03:40.716
Come on, let's hurry up.

03:40.717 --> 03:42.123
Like if you find yourself in Denmark

03:42.124 --> 03:43.356
and you're served ymer,

03:43.357 --> 03:45.193
you shouldn't complain that
it tastes like sour milk.

03:45.194 --> 03:46.361
What's ymer?

03:46.362 --> 03:47.896
Sour milk. The point is, you should

03:47.897 --> 03:49.664
be prepared to eat your ymer like a native.

03:49.665 --> 03:50.344
Oh? How's that?

03:50.345 --> 03:52.094
- On kammerjunker, obviously.
- Obviously.

03:52.095 --> 03:53.304
Look, just forget about the ymer.

03:53.305 --> 03:54.828
You're the one who keeps
bringing it up the ymer.

03:54.829 --> 03:56.096
What we're here for, my good man,

03:56.097 --> 03:57.602
- are the Chinese pork dumplings.
- I can't...

03:57.603 --> 03:59.114
They're pretty much the best in the world.

03:59.115 --> 04:02.911
So be cool and act like you're
in the Foreign Service, okay?

04:02.912 --> 04:04.770
Wait... why aren't you eating dumplings?

04:04.771 --> 04:06.014
They're not all gone, are they?

04:06.015 --> 04:07.415
God, I told you to walk faster!

04:07.416 --> 04:08.483
I've had no coffee.

04:08.484 --> 04:10.184
Okay, actually, Win is getting them for me.

04:10.185 --> 04:11.819
Win?

04:11.820 --> 04:14.155
Win, as in Win your fiancé?

04:14.156 --> 04:15.623
Yes, and he wants to meet you.

04:15.624 --> 04:18.860
Yes, and that's not going to happen.

04:18.861 --> 04:20.361
Wait, wait, you guys talk about me?

04:20.362 --> 04:21.262
Oh, my gosh.

04:21.262 --> 04:22.396
Chinese dumpling drama.

04:22.397 --> 04:24.065
- So... bye-bye.
- Save me some dumplings.

04:24.066 --> 04:26.134
Look, he doesn't know anything about us,

04:26.135 --> 04:27.268
so just relax.

04:27.269 --> 04:28.636
Absolutely... just on a different floor.

04:28.637 --> 04:31.539
Hey, it is really crazy in there.

04:31.540 --> 04:32.740
Never get between government workers

04:32.741 --> 04:34.609
and free food.

04:34.610 --> 04:35.743
Babe, this is Matt.

04:35.744 --> 04:36.844
Oh! The famous Matt.

04:36.845 --> 04:38.546
- Win Barrington.
- Nice to meet you.

04:38.547 --> 04:40.114
I know, I know, I look
like a walking stereotype.

04:40.115 --> 04:41.349
Right?

04:41.350 --> 04:43.249
Medical marijuana
lobbyist with the munchies.

04:45.554 --> 04:46.988
Daisy's told me

04:46.989 --> 04:48.756
so much about you.

04:48.757 --> 04:50.424
- Has she?
- Oh, yeah.

04:50.425 --> 04:51.958
Wow.

04:53.527 --> 04:54.894
Dumpling?

04:57.598 --> 04:59.207
Obviously, Prime Minister Arif

04:59.208 --> 05:01.131
will be immediately to your right, but...

05:01.132 --> 05:03.444
...Hasan, defense minister, already hates

05:03.445 --> 05:05.079
that a Sunni is Prime Minister,

05:05.080 --> 05:06.647
when the Shia have three
times the population.

05:06.648 --> 05:08.416
So he'll be damned if he's going to be

05:08.417 --> 05:09.750
tucked away to the right of Arif

05:09.751 --> 05:12.486
while the new oil minister, Barakat,

05:12.487 --> 05:14.021
who's a Kurd, is on my left.

05:14.022 --> 05:15.156
Am I right?

05:15.157 --> 05:16.624
Now you're just messing with me.

05:16.625 --> 05:17.992
But the Kurds are the only

05:17.993 --> 05:20.094
really reliably pro-Western contingent.

05:20.095 --> 05:21.262
Yeah. Not to mention

05:21.263 --> 05:23.397
the most effective fighters against ISIS.

05:23.398 --> 05:24.899
So there's a case to be made for Barakat

05:24.900 --> 05:27.668
to be in the second most prestigious spot,

05:27.669 --> 05:28.293
on your left.

05:28.294 --> 05:30.368
Well, good thing they
haven't all been on a plane

05:30.369 --> 05:31.739
for 15 hours together.

05:31.740 --> 05:34.308
Otherwise, they might be edgy or something.

05:34.309 --> 05:37.111
I mean, if these guys can't
even manage a photograph,

05:37.112 --> 05:38.545
I don't know how they're going to form

05:38.546 --> 05:40.614
an integrated army against ISIS.

05:40.615 --> 05:42.416
Well, the fact that they
all traveled here together

05:42.417 --> 05:43.717
is a great sign,

05:43.718 --> 05:46.120
and the picture will send
an important signal of unity.

05:46.121 --> 05:47.888
If their new government doesn't collapse

05:47.889 --> 05:49.289
when someone makes bunny ears.

05:49.290 --> 05:51.024
Ma'am, your daughter's here.

05:51.025 --> 05:52.359
I see that.

05:52.360 --> 05:53.427
Hi.

05:53.428 --> 05:54.695
Well, they're probably downstairs,

05:54.696 --> 05:56.830
- so I will send them up.
- Good.

05:56.831 --> 05:57.798
Hi.

05:57.799 --> 05:58.932
You on break or something?

05:58.933 --> 06:01.068
Okay, you were right.

06:01.069 --> 06:03.073
- Let's get that over with.
- You're going back to college?

06:03.074 --> 06:04.561
- Not funny.
- Sorry.

06:04.562 --> 06:05.439
About my shirt.

06:05.440 --> 06:07.741
My manager told me that I had to change.

06:07.742 --> 06:10.143
He even used the words "too casual".

06:10.144 --> 06:11.878
So if you want to gloat,
just get it over now.

06:11.879 --> 06:12.813
I'm not gloating.

06:12.814 --> 06:14.047
I didn't want to be right.

06:14.048 --> 06:15.682
Okay, well, if I had listened to you,

06:15.683 --> 06:17.851
then I wouldn't be here
now, asking you for $50.

06:17.852 --> 06:18.915
Fifty dollars?

06:18.916 --> 06:20.257
I can't go all the way back home.

06:20.258 --> 06:22.055
I mean, I would miss half of my shift.

06:22.056 --> 06:23.884
And all of my front of
house clothes are dirty.

06:23.885 --> 06:25.022
I don't know if I have the cash.

06:25.023 --> 06:27.127
- I-I just didn't plan ahead.
- What about your credit card?

06:27.128 --> 06:29.262
- I think we can call this an emergency.
- It's maxed out.

06:29.263 --> 06:31.974
Your emergency credit card is maxed out?

06:31.975 --> 06:32.688
Mom.

06:32.689 --> 06:34.428
Did I sleep through some
emergencies along the way?

06:34.429 --> 06:35.482
- Can you not?
- I have a right to ask

06:35.483 --> 06:36.736
- where our money has gone.
- Ma'am?

06:36.737 --> 06:37.804
- Okay, pl...
- Ma'am.

06:37.805 --> 06:40.565
The Iraqi delegation has arrived.

06:40.941 --> 06:42.943
Thank you.

06:42.944 --> 06:44.577
Please don't give me that look.

06:44.578 --> 06:47.147
I cannot put a foot right with you.

06:47.148 --> 06:48.648
It's exhausting to live with.

06:48.649 --> 06:49.649
You want me to move out?

06:49.650 --> 06:51.317
No. God...

06:51.318 --> 06:53.420
Can we do this later? Please?

06:53.421 --> 06:54.754
Or not at all, maybe?

06:54.755 --> 06:56.256
I mean, if you want
to... we-we don't have to.

06:56.257 --> 06:57.257
I don't want to.

06:57.258 --> 06:59.192
I love you.

06:59.193 --> 07:00.460
- We're good?
- Sure.

07:00.461 --> 07:01.827
Good.

07:05.164 --> 07:07.924
And her she is now. Secretary McCord.

07:10.203 --> 07:11.204
Um...

07:11.205 --> 07:13.239
wh-where can I get a blouse

07:13.240 --> 07:14.707
near here for $50?

07:14.708 --> 07:17.343
I don't think you can.

07:17.344 --> 07:19.012
Although the gift shop
downstairs sells T-shirts

07:19.013 --> 07:20.745
that say "State of Confusion.”

07:21.881 --> 07:23.349
God, I'm running out of time.

07:23.350 --> 07:25.418
I am so gonna get fired.

07:25.419 --> 07:27.120
Well, uh...

07:27.121 --> 07:29.155
I have an extra... like, a dressier blouse

07:29.156 --> 07:31.090
that I keep in a stash for your mom.

07:31.091 --> 07:32.225
Maybe that'll work?

07:32.226 --> 07:34.960
Yeah. Okay, thanks.

07:36.062 --> 07:37.530
I guess I just groveled for nothing.

07:37.531 --> 07:40.233
Well, it's good training
for a career in Washington.

07:40.234 --> 07:42.535
Well, yeah. Not interested.

07:42.536 --> 07:43.603
Smart girl.

07:43.604 --> 07:46.239
"Win.”

07:46.240 --> 07:47.473
What kind of stupid name is...

07:47.474 --> 07:49.308
Hey, Matty.

07:49.309 --> 07:50.343
Win!

07:50.344 --> 07:52.510
Hey.

07:54.380 --> 07:55.481
Daisy's not here.

07:55.482 --> 07:57.550
Obviously.

07:57.551 --> 07:59.115
She's probably down in the press room.

07:59.116 --> 08:00.641
I didn't actually come here today

08:00.642 --> 08:01.819
to speak to her.

08:02.922 --> 08:05.524
Because you came for the dumplings?

08:05.525 --> 08:06.559
I came to speak to you.

08:06.560 --> 08:08.494
Oh?

08:08.495 --> 08:10.563
Why is, um, why's that?

08:10.564 --> 08:12.031
Well, it's about Daisy.

08:12.032 --> 08:13.532
Well,

08:13.533 --> 08:15.835
you and Daisy.

08:17.237 --> 08:18.703
May I?

08:22.641 --> 08:24.076
All right.

08:24.077 --> 08:25.778
How about this one?

08:25.779 --> 08:27.613
A little too Dolly Madison.

08:27.614 --> 08:29.715
Waiters can't be choosers.

08:29.716 --> 08:31.316
I'm a hostess.

08:31.317 --> 08:33.251
Oh. Not for long, if you don't get going.

08:33.253 --> 08:36.255
All right, you're gonna wear this one.

08:36.256 --> 08:38.256
- Thanks.
- Mmm.

08:38.258 --> 08:40.725
Oh, I wish you were my assistant.

08:41.527 --> 08:43.006
I don't.

08:45.664 --> 08:49.434
Blake, any calls about the Meat Market?

08:49.435 --> 08:50.602
The... I'm sorry?

08:50.603 --> 08:52.771
Today is the first day
of a week-long period

08:52.772 --> 08:54.206
where the department matches

08:54.207 --> 08:55.707
its Foreign Service officers

08:55.708 --> 08:56.775
with their postings abroad.

08:56.776 --> 08:58.210
Yeah, I'm aware of that.

08:58.211 --> 09:00.445
I just wasn't aware that we
called it "The Meat Market.”

09:00.446 --> 09:02.948
Every year, a few officers
are unhappy with their postings

09:02.949 --> 09:04.649
and they call up here to complain.

09:04.650 --> 09:08.086
Shouldn't that be a Bureau
of Human Resources problem?

09:08.087 --> 09:11.757
Human Resources, in their
habitual defensive crouch,

09:11.758 --> 09:15.393
tends to lead these
unhappy officers to believe

09:15.394 --> 09:17.829
there is wiggle room when
it comes to their postings,

09:17.830 --> 09:18.997
but there is not.

09:18.998 --> 09:22.501
Well, no one's complained yet, so...

09:22.502 --> 09:24.222
maybe they're still busy eating their ymer.

09:27.072 --> 09:28.173
Have anyone who calls

09:28.174 --> 09:30.475
about a difficult posting come up here.

09:30.476 --> 09:32.010
I'll deal with them myself.

09:32.011 --> 09:33.410
Okay.

09:33.540 --> 09:36.255
Prime Minister Arif.

09:36.256 --> 09:38.216
Minister Hasan.

09:38.217 --> 09:40.251
Minister Barakat.

09:40.252 --> 09:42.620
It is a hopeful sign

09:42.621 --> 09:44.789
for your proud nation
and the rest of the world

09:44.790 --> 09:48.026
that you've traveled here together.

09:48.027 --> 09:51.396
We welcome you to the United States.

09:53.666 --> 09:56.267
"Thank you so much for
your gracious words.”

09:56.268 --> 09:58.303
Insh'Allah, we will welcome you

09:58.304 --> 10:00.471
to a peaceful Iraq

10:00.472 --> 10:02.073
one day very soon.

10:02.074 --> 10:03.741
I look forward to it.

10:03.742 --> 10:06.377
If you could please direct
your attention to the camera?

10:06.378 --> 10:08.446
You have never been to Iraq before,

10:08.447 --> 10:10.615
Madam Secretary?

10:10.616 --> 10:12.315
No, I haven't.

10:13.618 --> 10:15.019
Mike Hirst. Welcome to The Sandbox.

10:15.020 --> 10:16.320
Oh, thanks, Mike.

10:16.321 --> 10:17.688
They speak highly of you at Langley.

10:17.689 --> 10:19.524
Yeah, the brass is big on you, too.

10:19.525 --> 10:20.658
Best analyst they got.

10:20.659 --> 10:22.026
A real killer, they say.

10:22.027 --> 10:23.995
- Well, I don't know about that.
- Yeah, neither do I...

10:23.996 --> 10:25.963
'cause out here, we are real killers.

10:25.964 --> 10:27.565
And quite frankly, I don't
know what I'm gonna do

10:27.566 --> 10:29.000
with another desk jockey from Langley.

10:29.001 --> 10:30.134
Depends on how badly

10:30.135 --> 10:31.936
you want Safeer Al-Jamil, I guess.

10:31.937 --> 10:33.437
Son of a bitch has
blown up half of Baghdad,

10:33.438 --> 10:34.639
so yeah, I want him.

10:34.640 --> 10:35.906
And, look, while I appreciate

10:35.907 --> 10:37.429
your new Intel, I'm gonna
tell you something...

10:37.430 --> 10:39.477
That's right, Mike... my new Intel.

10:39.478 --> 10:41.712
I've been tracking
Safeer for two years now,

10:41.713 --> 10:44.115
so when we bring him in, based on my Intel,

10:44.116 --> 10:45.950
Langley wants me to interrogate him.

10:45.951 --> 10:47.084
We clear about that?

10:47.085 --> 10:48.753
Yes, sir.

10:48.754 --> 10:49.753
A real killer.

10:51.022 --> 10:52.456
Get away from the windows!

10:52.457 --> 10:53.691
What's going on?

10:53.692 --> 10:54.792
We've got an active shooter

10:54.793 --> 10:55.993
- situation, ma'am.
- Wh...

10:55.994 --> 10:56.861
We're in a lockdown.

10:56.862 --> 10:57.893
All we know is, he's armed

10:57.894 --> 10:59.630
and he's outside. Until
we know it's safe...

10:59.631 --> 11:01.198
- What about Stevie?
- We found her, ma'am.

11:01.199 --> 11:02.679
She's safe.

Alice Millevoi?

11:21.505 --> 11:24.112
- Um, yes?
- Do you know who I am?

11:24.113 --> 11:25.741
You're the secretary's chief of staff.

11:25.742 --> 11:28.410
So you know how busy I
am. Let's cut to the chase.

11:28.411 --> 11:31.012
Your assignment to
Portugal has been cancelled,

11:31.013 --> 11:32.948
and you've been reassigned to Angola.

11:32.949 --> 11:34.482
- What? I...
- You are the only person

11:34.483 --> 11:36.218
available with the experience

11:36.219 --> 11:37.519
and language skills required,

11:37.520 --> 11:40.021
so there is no room for appeal.

11:40.022 --> 11:41.590
But I've looked at your file,

11:41.591 --> 11:43.758
and you are well-prepared
to handle this post.

11:43.759 --> 11:44.759
I'm sorry,

11:44.760 --> 11:45.961
but the decision is final.

11:45.962 --> 11:47.696
So if you'll excuse me,

11:47.697 --> 11:49.331
I have other matters to tend to.

11:49.332 --> 11:50.517
Sorry, ma'am, but I'm a bit confused.

11:50.518 --> 11:52.552
- I was assured...
- We all have our disappointments,

11:52.553 --> 11:53.601
Ms. Millevoi.

11:53.602 --> 11:56.436
Thank you for your service,
and good luck in Angola.

11:57.188 --> 11:59.174
Active shooter situation,
ma'am. We're in a lockdown.

11:59.175 --> 12:01.709
What? Well, I need to get to the secretary.

12:01.710 --> 12:04.012
She's being secured, ma'am. But
until the threat is resolved,

12:04.013 --> 12:05.914
everyone is required to shelter in place.

Gentlemen,

12:19.128 --> 12:21.596
I know this is unusual,

12:21.597 --> 12:24.666
but not to worry. This is

12:24.667 --> 12:27.535
a secure building; the
windows are bulletproof.

12:27.536 --> 12:30.405
They're asking that we remain

12:30.406 --> 12:32.740
here until the threat is lifted.

12:35.143 --> 12:37.945
It will give us a better chance

12:37.946 --> 12:39.647
to get to know one another.

12:41.650 --> 12:43.651
_

12:44.708 --> 12:45.807
_

12:47.121 --> 12:49.355
_

12:49.603 --> 12:52.526
_

12:53.029 --> 12:54.520
_

12:54.521 --> 12:58.399
Gentlemen... you must be exhausted
from your travels. Can I...

12:58.400 --> 13:01.202
invite you to have something to drink?

13:01.203 --> 13:03.971
Uh, we have some water,

13:03.972 --> 13:06.107
tea, fruit juice...

13:06.108 --> 13:08.474
_

13:09.610 --> 13:10.845
- He says...
- I agree.

13:10.846 --> 13:12.279
But I don't keep anything stronger

13:12.280 --> 13:13.447
in the office.

13:13.448 --> 13:17.584
_

13:19.920 --> 13:21.422
You speak Arabic?

13:21.423 --> 13:23.139
Not as well as you speak
English, I'm afraid.

13:23.140 --> 13:24.725
- Come, please.
- Of course

13:24.726 --> 13:26.460
she speaks Arabic.

13:26.461 --> 13:28.829
Everyone knows that.

13:28.830 --> 13:30.230
Madam Secretary,

13:30.231 --> 13:33.400
please excuse the prime
minister's translator.

13:33.401 --> 13:35.569
My translator has more manners,

13:35.570 --> 13:37.771
but he is downstairs with
the rest of my entourage.

13:37.772 --> 13:39.673
My apologies, Madam Secretary.

13:39.674 --> 13:42.508
Please, come.

13:46.347 --> 13:49.149
Of course I'm not making it up.

13:49.150 --> 13:52.920
You didn't like my shirt,
so I came to my mom's office.

13:52.921 --> 13:55.264
And now there's a guy with a gun outside.

13:55.265 --> 13:57.104
- You don't sound very afraid...
- Well, I'm sorry

13:57.105 --> 13:59.626
that I don't sound more nervous, Dave.

13:59.627 --> 14:01.495
- Can you find someone to fill in for you?
- Okay, yeah.

14:01.496 --> 14:03.530
I'll call... I'll call
Meghan, and-and I'll...

14:03.531 --> 14:04.998
ask if she can cover for me.

14:04.999 --> 14:07.466
All right. Thank you.

14:09.971 --> 14:12.339
If my mom had just saved the lecture

14:12.340 --> 14:14.674
and just given me the stupid 50 bucks,

14:14.675 --> 14:16.643
I might actually be at work already.

14:16.644 --> 14:18.556
Or you might be some nut job's hostage.

14:18.557 --> 14:20.847
Well, arguably, I'm kind
of my mom's hostage, so...

14:20.848 --> 14:22.015
I can think of worse people

14:22.016 --> 14:23.550
to be held hostage by.

14:23.551 --> 14:25.819
Again, a deranged gunman comes to mind.

14:25.820 --> 14:27.253
Look,

14:27.254 --> 14:28.488
not my business but...

14:28.489 --> 14:30.490
she's not trying to be on your case.

14:30.491 --> 14:31.725
I think she just wants you to...

14:31.726 --> 14:33.693
find your thing.

14:33.694 --> 14:37.095
Wait, she talks to you about me?

14:37.730 --> 14:39.499
Hi.

14:39.500 --> 14:41.668
I was really worried. I'm so glad

14:41.669 --> 14:42.957
- you are still here.
- Yeah, yeah.

14:42.958 --> 14:44.737
My flagrant irresponsibility

14:44.738 --> 14:46.539
- might have saved my life.
- Oh, come on.

14:46.540 --> 14:49.475
I hate that we left in a fight.
You know I adore you, right?

14:49.476 --> 14:51.044
Yeah.

14:51.045 --> 14:51.993
- Do me a favor,
- Mm-hmm.

14:51.994 --> 14:53.780
call your dad and your
brother and your sister.

14:53.781 --> 14:55.248
Tell 'em that we're fine...

14:55.249 --> 14:56.282
Already left word.

14:56.283 --> 14:57.517
Thanks, Blake. Okay.

14:57.518 --> 14:59.886
- I have to head back in. You're good?
- Okay.

14:59.887 --> 15:02.567
- You just... hang tight, okay?
- Mm-hmm. Yeah.

15:02.822 --> 15:04.057
Is that my blouse?

15:04.058 --> 15:05.557
Looks good.

15:14.767 --> 15:18.169
Well, this is just fantastic.

15:20.339 --> 15:22.508
So, Matt...

15:22.509 --> 15:26.512
on a scale of one to ten,

15:26.513 --> 15:28.947
how much do you love Daisy?

15:31.717 --> 15:33.585
Wow.

15:37.223 --> 15:39.625
Okay.

15:39.626 --> 15:42.128
That's a complicated question.

15:42.129 --> 15:45.196
Ooh, wait, before you start...

15:45.931 --> 15:47.767
Okay, shoot.

15:47.768 --> 15:49.335
I'm sorry, what's happening?

15:49.336 --> 15:52.071
Oh, I-I'm sorry, man.

15:52.072 --> 15:53.439
Uh, her birthday's coming up.

15:53.440 --> 15:54.874
I'm gonna surprise her with a video.

15:54.875 --> 15:58.210
You know, all her best friends and
colleagues telling her how great she is.

15:58.211 --> 15:59.878
I totally thought I told you that already.

15:59.879 --> 16:01.213
Hmm, sorry, crispy brain.

16:01.214 --> 16:03.349
That's right.

16:03.350 --> 16:04.657
What did you think was happening?

16:04.658 --> 16:05.663
No idea.

16:05.664 --> 16:09.463
I mean, uh, this whole situation
has-has got me jumpy, you know?

16:09.464 --> 16:13.392
Deranged gunman outside,
trapped in enclosed space...

16:13.393 --> 16:14.460
Just try to relax.

16:14.461 --> 16:15.527
It's all gonna be fine.

16:15.528 --> 16:17.529
That-that's easy for you to say.

16:17.530 --> 16:20.532
My heart's racing, my mouth's all dry.

16:20.533 --> 16:22.258
You know, I'll tell you the truth...

16:22.259 --> 16:26.605
when I get this nervous, I
usually smoke a cigarette.

16:26.606 --> 16:28.207
I know, I know, I know.

16:28.208 --> 16:30.242
It's a bad habit, super gross... sue me.

16:30.243 --> 16:31.577
Well, I don't have any cigarettes,

16:31.578 --> 16:33.911
but I do have some gum, if you want.

16:36.381 --> 16:38.649
Yeah, okay.

16:39.251 --> 16:40.285
Thanks.

16:40.286 --> 16:42.019
Yeah.

16:44.938 --> 16:47.040
It's a real love-fest in here.

16:47.041 --> 16:49.775
Stay the course, Jay, stay the course.

16:58.718 --> 17:01.478
You have been to Iraq.

17:03.323 --> 17:05.391
Down! Get down on the ground!

17:05.392 --> 17:06.826
Down!

17:06.827 --> 17:08.060
Get down!

17:08.061 --> 17:09.729
Do not move and you will not be harmed!

17:11.385 --> 17:12.769
_

17:12.933 --> 17:17.273
_

17:37.056 --> 17:38.991
I wasn't sure until I
heard you speak Arabic.

17:38.992 --> 17:41.894
My cousin Safeer Al-Jamil was dragged away

17:41.895 --> 17:44.130
by coalition forces.

17:44.131 --> 17:46.132
And you were there.

17:46.133 --> 17:48.100
I was there, too.

17:48.101 --> 17:51.135
And that was the last
time I saw Safeer alive.

17:53.792 --> 17:55.453
_

17:56.327 --> 17:57.528
_

18:00.479 --> 18:03.822
I've always had trouble
with a particular passage

18:03.823 --> 18:05.618
from one of my favorite Arabic poems.

18:05.619 --> 18:08.787
But I think I have a copy
of the book in my office.

18:08.788 --> 18:10.421
Would you mind?

18:12.691 --> 18:15.728
Well, I would hate for your career

18:15.729 --> 18:18.397
to be ruined by one reckless moment.

18:18.398 --> 18:20.766
I am going to tell you this one time.

18:20.767 --> 18:22.768
I was never in Iraq.

18:22.769 --> 18:23.802
Do you understand?

18:23.803 --> 18:27.239
And while I do know who your cousin was,

18:27.240 --> 18:29.408
as to what happened to him...

18:29.409 --> 18:32.611
Safeer, you should have stayed in London.

18:32.612 --> 18:34.112
Instead of killing your own people,

18:34.113 --> 18:36.081
you could be getting your
degree in engineering,

18:36.082 --> 18:38.150
thinking about settling
down with that girl...

18:38.151 --> 18:39.631
what's her name? Fiona.

18:40.385 --> 18:42.688
Oh, yeah.

18:42.689 --> 18:44.122
I know everything about you.

18:44.123 --> 18:46.558
Which is why you're gonna tell me

18:46.559 --> 18:49.628
when and where the next
truck-bomb is set to go off,

18:49.629 --> 18:52.898
so more innocent Muslims
don't have to die...

18:52.899 --> 18:57.002
_

19:00.939 --> 19:03.041
I honestly don't know.

19:03.042 --> 19:05.677
Now, if anybody asks,

19:05.678 --> 19:09.614
you helped me translate a
particularly thorny passage

19:09.615 --> 19:11.616
of the Qasida, by Al-Buhturi.

19:11.617 --> 19:15.287
But we will never speak of
this again, do you understand?

19:15.288 --> 19:16.321
Sorry, Mom?

19:16.322 --> 19:17.722
- Yeah.
- I just talked to Dad.

19:17.723 --> 19:19.457
I just wanted to let
you know, I-I told him

19:19.458 --> 19:21.379
- what's going on.
- Yeah, yeah. No, no, that's great.

19:21.380 --> 19:22.160
- Okay.
- Okay.

19:22.161 --> 19:24.162
All right, baby, I'll
check in with you later.

19:24.944 --> 19:26.432
Okay.

19:43.260 --> 19:45.129
The stand off with police and a gunman

19:45.130 --> 19:46.997
outside the State Department continues.

19:46.998 --> 19:48.199
No shots have been fired,

19:48.200 --> 19:50.568
but the gunman is allegedly
protesting a state visit

19:50.569 --> 19:53.302
by Iraq's newly-elected leaders,
with secretary of state Eli...

19:54.905 --> 19:56.440
Okay, I'm just gonna say it...

19:56.441 --> 19:57.875
this reassignment is unfair.

19:57.876 --> 20:00.077
That's your concern right now?

20:01.379 --> 20:02.713
Oh, you want to talk gunmen?

20:02.714 --> 20:04.815
I was held up in Afghanistan in 2003.

20:04.816 --> 20:06.083
I barely made it out alive.

20:06.084 --> 20:09.052
Yes, and I see you received
a commendation for it.

20:09.053 --> 20:11.555
And did you also see that
they had to medevac me

20:11.556 --> 20:13.022
out of Sierra Leone?

20:14.458 --> 20:17.594
I have worked here for nearly 30 years.

20:17.595 --> 20:19.997
I have done my time in hardship posts,

20:19.998 --> 20:21.798
and I am very good at my job.

20:21.799 --> 20:23.433
Don't you think I deserve Portugal?

20:23.434 --> 20:26.203
The needs of this department
and of this nation supersede

20:26.204 --> 20:27.771
any personal desires,

20:27.772 --> 20:31.608
and the department needs you in Angola.

20:31.609 --> 20:35.012
You're the only one available
with the necessary experience.

20:35.013 --> 20:37.714
You know what, Miss Tolliver?

20:37.715 --> 20:42.352
They didn't reassign me to
Angola because of my skills.

20:42.353 --> 20:46.221
They reassigned me because I'm
a woman, and because I'm single.

20:48.525 --> 20:50.960
_

20:51.041 --> 20:52.464
_

20:52.596 --> 20:53.864
You're gonna love this.

20:53.865 --> 20:55.951
The new prime minister's men
back in Iraq have arrested

20:55.952 --> 20:57.500
the previous oil minister for corruption.

20:57.501 --> 21:00.003
So, his first official act is gonna be

21:00.004 --> 21:02.005
to put a Shiite on trial?

21:02.006 --> 21:03.173
Unbelievable.

21:03.174 --> 21:06.710
You see? You see, he waits
until he is far from home

21:06.711 --> 21:08.578
because he knows he has broken his promise!

21:08.579 --> 21:10.946
_

21:11.363 --> 21:12.569
_

21:12.582 --> 21:14.584
Gentlemen, gentlemen. _

21:14.585 --> 21:16.152
Please.

21:16.153 --> 21:17.587
If we could just calm...

21:17.588 --> 21:21.257
How long until the next call to prayer?

21:21.258 --> 21:23.426
Too long.

21:23.427 --> 21:27.730
So, in, um, these chats
that you have without me...

21:27.731 --> 21:29.399
what do you talk about?

21:29.400 --> 21:31.668
What a disappointment I am?

21:31.669 --> 21:34.103
Well, that's my position; she defends you.

21:39.776 --> 21:42.111
Um, yeah, it's, uh, it's weird, you know,

21:42.112 --> 21:43.413
you drop out of school,

21:43.414 --> 21:45.448
and suddenly people start
seeing you really differently.

21:45.449 --> 21:47.116
Mm-hmm.

21:47.117 --> 21:48.451
It's like, I-I tried...

21:48.452 --> 21:49.886
I was thinking about selling my eggs.

21:49.887 --> 21:51.721
The clinic wouldn't take them.

21:51.722 --> 21:52.989
They only wanted college grads.

21:52.990 --> 21:55.191
It's like even my eggs are devalued.

21:56.293 --> 21:58.533
I'm sorry, you tried to sell your what?

21:59.061 --> 22:00.396
Relax.

22:00.397 --> 22:01.764
I-It was a low moment.

22:01.765 --> 22:03.933
I just wanted to find a way of making money

22:03.934 --> 22:08.369
that didn't involve wearing a
white blouse and seating people.

22:09.939 --> 22:11.641
Just don't tell my mom.

22:11.642 --> 22:14.410
Okay?

22:14.411 --> 22:16.812
Yeah, I don't think that'll be a problem.

22:16.813 --> 22:20.016
Daisy is a hard worker,

22:20.017 --> 22:22.284
and very dependable.

22:22.285 --> 22:26.021
She's really kind... to
the cafeteria workers.

22:26.022 --> 22:29.158
She's... like,

22:29.159 --> 22:32.428
"Hey, Penny, how's it going?

22:32.429 --> 22:35.164
Javier, qué pasa?”

22:35.165 --> 22:38.300
Because she's... she's, like,

22:38.301 --> 22:41.370
really tough on the outside,

22:41.371 --> 22:43.405
but on the inside...

22:43.406 --> 22:46.775
On the inside, she's just...

22:46.776 --> 22:50.813
she's so...

22:50.814 --> 22:52.815
so tender.

22:54.751 --> 22:57.452
What was I talking about?

22:57.453 --> 22:59.788
Dude, you're feeling it already?

22:59.789 --> 23:02.090
Feeling what?

23:02.091 --> 23:04.560
Oh, my God, you gave me pot gum?!

23:04.561 --> 23:06.261
Yes.

23:06.262 --> 23:07.829
Dude, study after study proves

23:07.830 --> 23:09.298
marijuana's efficacy in treating anxiety.

23:09.299 --> 23:11.133
Uh, you should thank me.

23:11.134 --> 23:13.702
I didn't even know pot gum was a thing.

23:15.071 --> 23:17.439
The video... the vid...

23:17.440 --> 23:20.275
If I get caught, I'm so screwed.

23:20.276 --> 23:23.178
Hey, just something to calm you down, man.

23:23.179 --> 23:25.180
Had to... had to calm you down, man.

23:25.181 --> 23:27.282
Oh, you were acting so guilty, so weird.

23:27.283 --> 23:29.651
You were all, mm, being
so straight. It was...

23:33.689 --> 23:35.657
- What are you talking about?
- Wait a minute.

23:35.658 --> 23:37.158
Did you, uh...?

23:37.159 --> 23:40.028
I mean... did you hook...?

23:40.029 --> 23:42.789
Did you hook up with Daisy or something?

23:47.903 --> 23:49.771
She never would never.

23:49.772 --> 23:51.873
- She would never.
- Ah, she... ah, she would.

23:51.874 --> 23:53.942
- Ah, she...
- Wait.

23:53.943 --> 23:55.744
Wait a minute. Did you?

23:55.745 --> 23:57.679
You went back

23:57.680 --> 23:59.114
on your word!

23:59.115 --> 24:01.382
You assured everyone there
would be no reprisals,

24:01.383 --> 24:03.852
and now, you are issuing arrest warrants?!

24:05.950 --> 24:08.481
"For too long, the Shia
have been oppressing the Sunni.

24:08.482 --> 24:10.144
"And now we are back in power,

24:10.145 --> 24:11.885
- and now, it is our turn"
- Until when?

24:12.548 --> 24:14.749
There are three times
as many Shia as Sunni.

24:14.750 --> 24:15.586
They have the backing

24:15.587 --> 24:17.421
of the Iranians. Your government

24:17.422 --> 24:20.857
will fall and your people
will be slaughtered by ISIS.

24:20.858 --> 24:22.492
Is that what you want?

24:22.493 --> 24:24.960
_

24:25.439 --> 24:27.063
You know what he's saying, Madam Secretary,

24:27.064 --> 24:29.199
so now it is your turn to listen to me.

24:29.200 --> 24:30.834
The arrests will continue,

24:30.835 --> 24:33.036
and the U.S. will do nothing to stop them,

24:33.037 --> 24:35.071
because if you interfere in any way,

24:35.072 --> 24:37.741
I will tell everyone
about your past in Iraq,

24:37.742 --> 24:39.409
starting with your daughter.

24:39.410 --> 24:43.980
Do you honestly think
anyone would believe you?

24:43.981 --> 24:46.383
Do you want to take that chance?

24:49.058 --> 24:49.858
_

24:54.326 --> 24:56.790
The gunman's name is Mark
Ferguson, 20 years old.

24:56.791 --> 25:00.732
His brother's a war hero...
two tours in Iraq, KIA in 2008.

25:00.733 --> 25:02.633
Parents say, after his brother passed away,

25:02.634 --> 25:04.782
he fell into a depression,
never pulled out of it.

25:04.783 --> 25:06.703
- Oh, poor kid.
- He's been off his meds

25:06.704 --> 25:08.238
and homeless the last six months.

25:08.239 --> 25:10.541
FBI negotiators say that,
as far as they can tell,

25:10.542 --> 25:12.442
he's here to protest what he sees

25:12.443 --> 25:14.578
as a slippery slope back
to engagement in Iraq.

25:14.579 --> 25:17.447
At this point, I don't disagree with him.

25:17.448 --> 25:19.082
Any chance he'll just give up?

25:19.083 --> 25:21.084
Well, he's still talking, which is good.

25:21.085 --> 25:22.652
But he claims he has grenades.

25:22.653 --> 25:23.920
Which is not.

25:23.921 --> 25:26.289
All right, keep me posted.

25:26.290 --> 25:28.191
Yes, ma'am.

25:28.192 --> 25:31.361
How did it go with Arif?

25:31.362 --> 25:32.796
He's got a lifetime of grievances,

25:32.797 --> 25:36.700
finally the chance to
do something about 'em.

25:36.701 --> 25:39.669
Their country is on fire, and
all those guys can think of

25:39.670 --> 25:41.872
is settling old scores,
so, I say, screw it.

25:41.873 --> 25:44.708
Let's back the Kurds and contain
this cancer as best we can.

25:44.709 --> 25:45.842
No, we can't just stand back

25:45.843 --> 25:47.944
and let it collapse into chaos again.

25:47.945 --> 25:49.813
They have lost too much, and so have we.

25:49.814 --> 25:51.641
We can't want it more than they do, ma'am.

25:52.550 --> 25:54.317
What are you gonna do in there?

25:54.318 --> 25:57.554
Get them to take some responsibility

25:57.555 --> 26:00.990
and take some ourselves.

26:00.991 --> 26:03.393
Where are you going?

26:03.394 --> 26:06.862
To talk to my daughter.

26:10.967 --> 26:12.202
Wow.

26:12.203 --> 26:14.003
Yeah.

26:14.004 --> 26:16.105
And you ended things how long ago?

26:16.106 --> 26:18.707
A couple months.

26:19.876 --> 26:22.345
So, like, weeks before I proposed.

26:22.346 --> 26:24.479
It's fantastic.

26:25.481 --> 26:27.916
Look, man...

26:28.751 --> 26:31.187
it's super messed up, you know?

26:31.188 --> 26:33.955
So...

26:34.891 --> 26:37.258
...have at it.

26:39.962 --> 26:41.297
Open your eyes, man.

26:41.298 --> 26:42.632
I'm not gonna hit you.

26:42.633 --> 26:43.633
Why not?

26:43.634 --> 26:45.568
Because what good's that gonna do?

26:45.569 --> 26:47.737
The greatest woman you're ever gonna meet

26:47.738 --> 26:50.506
in your entire life cheated on you with me,

26:50.507 --> 26:53.342
and what... you're gonna just let it go?

26:53.343 --> 26:54.610
Yeah.

26:54.611 --> 26:58.314
Yeah, that's exactly what I'm gonna do.

26:58.315 --> 27:01.851
I'm gonna walk out of
this building and away

27:01.852 --> 27:04.720
from the both of you, and...

27:04.721 --> 27:07.289
begin the extremely difficult
process of trying to move on.

27:07.290 --> 27:08.924
- Because what choice do I have?
- You never had to fight

27:08.925 --> 27:10.472
for one thing in your life, have you?

27:10.473 --> 27:12.728
Good-looking rich guy, everybody's pal.

27:12.729 --> 27:14.494
What-what? You cannot
be serious right now.

27:14.495 --> 27:16.365
One Westport princess after another, right?

27:16.366 --> 27:17.433
You even make weed look waspy!

27:17.434 --> 27:19.568
For your information, smart guy, marijuana

27:19.569 --> 27:21.531
happens to be both good
business and good policy!

27:21.532 --> 27:22.604
Oh, my God! Would you shut up?!

27:22.605 --> 27:23.554
- Ow!
- Ow!

27:23.555 --> 27:25.274
- My ear!
- My hand!

27:25.275 --> 27:26.842
What the hell was that?!

27:29.246 --> 27:30.612
Look, you...

27:30.613 --> 27:33.048
If she were my girl,

27:33.049 --> 27:36.218
and she cheated on me...

27:36.219 --> 27:38.287
Hey!

27:38.288 --> 27:40.389
- What?
- I swear to God...

27:40.390 --> 27:42.823
I'd kill the guy.

27:43.892 --> 27:47.628
Well, the good news is you'll
probably get your chance.

27:53.335 --> 27:55.836
It's locked.

27:57.940 --> 27:59.441
I have missed countless Thanksgivings

27:59.442 --> 28:02.144
and Christmases with my
family because somebody

28:02.145 --> 28:03.478
always had to hold down the fort.

28:03.479 --> 28:04.880
Well, that somebody's not going to be me...

28:04.881 --> 28:05.847
I get it.

28:05.848 --> 28:08.250
But you know the department policy

28:08.251 --> 28:11.420
is very clear about making
these assignments in a fair

28:11.421 --> 28:12.687
and unbiased manner...

28:12.688 --> 28:14.990
David Cruz, James Gordon, Lisa Alva...

28:14.991 --> 28:17.425
all of them have the necessary experience

28:17.426 --> 28:19.528
and the language skills.

28:19.529 --> 28:21.730
They also have spouses

28:21.731 --> 28:23.265
and children.

28:23.266 --> 28:25.567
And I'm an unmarried woman in her 50s.

28:25.568 --> 28:28.537
And so, to the State Department,

28:28.538 --> 28:30.171
I'm expendable.

28:30.172 --> 28:33.575
I would argue the opposite.

28:33.576 --> 28:37.278
That you're dependable.

28:37.279 --> 28:40.682
That's what I always told myself.

28:40.683 --> 28:42.784
And yet, here we are.

28:42.785 --> 28:44.753
Oh...

28:44.754 --> 28:46.688
who am I kidding?

28:46.689 --> 28:50.125
The State Department is... is my life.

28:50.126 --> 28:52.961
Of course I'll go to Angola.

28:52.962 --> 28:56.463
Maybe next year I'll
get a post in, in Europe.

28:58.032 --> 29:01.035
There was another truck bomb explosion

29:01.036 --> 29:02.871
this morning at the market in Sadr City.

29:02.872 --> 29:04.839
- Allahu Akbar.
- No, no. No, no.

29:04.840 --> 29:06.975
Not one American was killed.

29:06.976 --> 29:09.177
Want to see who you did kill?

29:09.178 --> 29:11.811
_

29:12.556 --> 29:13.648
_

29:14.194 --> 29:15.336
_

29:15.906 --> 29:17.205
_

29:17.685 --> 29:19.086
Look at it!

29:19.087 --> 29:21.988
You bastard! Look at what you've done!

29:23.090 --> 29:24.592
You're going to tell me.

29:24.593 --> 29:26.661
When is the next attack going to be?

29:26.662 --> 29:28.396
Where and when?

29:28.397 --> 29:29.931
This is your last chance.

29:29.932 --> 29:31.232
You gotta tell me something.

29:31.233 --> 29:35.833
_

29:36.003 --> 29:38.873
Allahu Akbar. Allahu Akbar!

29:38.874 --> 29:41.082
Allahu Akbar! Allahu Akbar!

29:41.468 --> 29:43.844
We've tried it your way,
killer. It's time to step it up.

29:43.845 --> 29:45.445
Do it!

29:48.678 --> 29:49.876
Shut up!

29:50.649 --> 29:52.152
I said shut up!

29:59.560 --> 30:01.128
What...

30:03.865 --> 30:06.999
what did "stepping it up” mean?

30:08.268 --> 30:11.772
Stress positions.

30:11.773 --> 30:13.640
Physical abuse.

30:13.641 --> 30:16.042
Waterboarding.

30:18.245 --> 30:21.181
Uh... I wasn't

30:21.182 --> 30:24.051
in the room when they did it.

30:24.052 --> 30:26.186
But...

30:26.187 --> 30:29.223
I knew what was...

30:29.224 --> 30:32.358
happening, obviously.

30:39.566 --> 30:41.868
Why are you telling me this?

30:41.869 --> 30:45.938
'Cause I have to.

30:53.113 --> 30:55.115
Well, I really wish you hadn't.

30:55.116 --> 30:57.184
We were at war.

30:57.185 --> 31:00.453
Changes the landscape.

31:00.454 --> 31:02.622
And it forces you to face things

31:02.623 --> 31:05.657
you didn't even want to know.

31:07.027 --> 31:08.829
Yeah, like...

31:08.830 --> 31:10.830
like the fact that your mother is not

31:10.831 --> 31:12.399
the person that you thought she was at all?

31:12.400 --> 31:14.534
- Who did you think I was?
- I don't know, Mom.

31:14.535 --> 31:15.535
Not a torturer!

31:17.238 --> 31:18.271
Stupid work.

31:18.272 --> 31:19.939
- Stevie...
- Don't.

31:19.940 --> 31:22.307
Yes, Dave?

31:34.755 --> 31:36.530
Zaid, I think we should talk.

31:36.531 --> 31:38.031
I think you would be wiser to keep silent.

31:38.032 --> 31:40.467
I think you should stop
mourning your cousin Safeer.

31:40.468 --> 31:41.568
You know nothing about him.

31:41.569 --> 31:42.970
No, I know everything about him.

31:42.971 --> 31:44.404
I know where he went to school,

31:44.405 --> 31:46.373
who his family was and who he killed.

31:46.374 --> 31:48.442
Your cousin was a mass murderer,

31:48.443 --> 31:50.210
and I am glad that I took him
off the streets of Baghdad...

31:50.211 --> 31:51.945
You will be glad when I
tell Prime Minister Arif...

31:51.946 --> 31:53.013
I don't care who you tell.

31:53.014 --> 31:54.298
Maybe they'll believe you,

31:54.299 --> 31:55.115
maybe they won't.

31:55.116 --> 31:57.350
But it won't change U.S. policy in Iraq.

31:57.351 --> 32:02.428
I am not your hostage,
do you understand me?

32:04.057 --> 32:05.792
If you want to grieve someone,

32:05.793 --> 32:07.294
you should grieve your grandfather Abdul,

32:07.295 --> 32:10.497
the scientist who was killed by Saddam.

32:10.498 --> 32:13.699
How do you know about my grandfather?

32:14.501 --> 32:17.404
I told you I know
everything about your family.

32:17.405 --> 32:18.738
You come from

32:18.739 --> 32:20.907
a long line of great men,

32:20.908 --> 32:23.376
who built a great nation that dates back

32:23.377 --> 32:25.412
all the way to the Babylonians.

32:25.413 --> 32:28.915
That is your legacy.

32:28.916 --> 32:31.384
So I'm gonna do my part
to help that heroic nation.

32:31.385 --> 32:33.386
What you do is up to you.

32:33.387 --> 32:36.156
But whatever you tell the prime minister,

32:36.157 --> 32:37.590
be sure to tell him this.

32:37.591 --> 32:40.226
Unless he releases the former oil minister

32:40.227 --> 32:41.961
and drops the charges against him,

32:41.962 --> 32:43.864
the United States is
going to pull our support

32:43.865 --> 32:45.608
of the new government and back the Kurds

32:45.609 --> 32:46.900
for statehood.

32:46.901 --> 32:48.261
Sorry to interrupt, ma'am.

32:49.102 --> 32:50.837
Go.

32:50.838 --> 32:52.204
Tell him what I said.

32:53.270 --> 32:54.862
The gunman's been apprehended.

32:54.863 --> 32:56.991
The SWAT team disarmed him
with a flash-bang grenade.

32:56.992 --> 32:58.799
But they shot him in
the leg in the takedown.

32:58.800 --> 33:01.469
Mr. Ferguson's being
transported to the hospital.

33:01.470 --> 33:03.737
The FBI doesn't think he was
actually going to shoot anyone.

33:03.738 --> 33:05.773
He's just a messed-up guy

33:05.774 --> 33:06.941
with a lot of issues.

33:06.942 --> 33:09.543
Well, I'm glad no one else got hurt.

33:09.544 --> 33:12.112
Well, we think he was acting alone.

33:12.113 --> 33:15.115
So... I'm gonna lift the lockdown order,

33:15.116 --> 33:17.550
effective immediately.

33:19.920 --> 33:21.155
Wait, so that's it? I-I kind of thought

33:21.156 --> 33:22.389
we had a Breakfast Club
kind of thing going...

33:22.390 --> 33:23.792
I really have to get out of here.

33:23.793 --> 33:25.064
Well, wait, what did your boss say to you?

33:25.065 --> 33:26.328
You had a legitimate reason to be late.

33:26.329 --> 33:27.662
I don't want to talk about it.

33:27.663 --> 33:29.364
Okay, it's gonna be all right, really.

33:29.365 --> 33:30.832
You're gonna get another
job. Hey, wait a minute.

33:30.833 --> 33:32.953
Wait a minute, hey, hey,
hey... hold up, hold up.

33:33.468 --> 33:35.804
Look...

33:35.805 --> 33:37.205
for what it's worth,

33:37.206 --> 33:40.341
if I ever did the surrogacy thing,

33:40.342 --> 33:43.011
I'd want eggs just like yours.

33:43.012 --> 33:45.379
You got winner eggs, kid.

33:54.322 --> 33:56.057
You know, we spend all this time

33:56.058 --> 33:57.659
wondering whether we're good enough

33:57.660 --> 34:00.161
to even be around her.

34:00.162 --> 34:02.063
But what if we're better?

34:02.064 --> 34:05.266
Did you ever think about that?

34:05.267 --> 34:07.669
I have to go, but thank you for the shirt.

34:07.670 --> 34:10.036
Yeah...

34:12.706 --> 34:14.574
Thank you again for your patience.

34:14.576 --> 34:15.943
Excuse me.

34:15.944 --> 34:17.911
I don't know what happened,

34:17.913 --> 34:20.014
but Arif reversed himself.

34:20.014 --> 34:21.215
Word is, he's dropping the charges.

34:21.216 --> 34:23.518
They're going to the White House tomorrow.

34:23.518 --> 34:25.085
Call the White House.

34:25.087 --> 34:26.454
It happens tonight.

34:26.455 --> 34:28.623
Gentlemen...

34:28.623 --> 34:31.926
it was an honor having you as my guests.

34:31.927 --> 34:34.362
Although I know it was
for a little bit longer

34:34.362 --> 34:35.596
than you would have liked.

34:35.597 --> 34:38.299
Um, I-I did want to say something

34:38.300 --> 34:40.835
to you before you went to the White House.

34:40.835 --> 34:43.737
I said something earlier today

34:43.739 --> 34:46.940
about letting go of the past,

34:46.942 --> 34:50.878
and I realized how...

34:50.879 --> 34:52.679
arrogant that was.

34:56.516 --> 34:57.685
All of our people

34:57.686 --> 35:00.588
still have open wounds

35:00.589 --> 35:02.122
and blood on our hands

35:02.123 --> 35:04.724
from inflicting those wounds on each other.

35:05.492 --> 35:07.428
Everyone here wants to be a great leader

35:07.429 --> 35:09.330
to their people, but in the face

35:09.331 --> 35:11.332
of the inhumanity,

35:11.333 --> 35:14.168
the indecency of terrorism,

35:14.169 --> 35:16.837
things like-like trust

35:16.838 --> 35:19.706
and-and competence and decency

35:19.707 --> 35:21.474
are greatness.

35:22.142 --> 35:23.477
For the sake of your nation

35:23.478 --> 35:25.546
and the rest of the world, Insh'Allah.

35:25.547 --> 35:28.715
_

35:31.818 --> 35:33.487
Insh'Allah.

35:33.488 --> 35:35.889
Madam Secretary...

35:35.890 --> 35:40.093
Thank you. Very much.

35:40.094 --> 35:42.495
Thank you.

35:44.331 --> 35:46.233
Baby, I'm so sorry.

35:46.234 --> 35:48.200
I got trapped in the press room.

35:48.869 --> 35:50.736
What happened?

35:52.773 --> 35:54.074
Are you okay?

35:54.075 --> 35:56.742
What do you think?

35:58.378 --> 36:00.746
What did you do?

36:02.916 --> 36:05.285
You deserve someone who'd fight for you.

36:05.286 --> 36:07.153
It doesn't have to be me,

36:07.154 --> 36:09.788
but it can't be him.

36:16.763 --> 36:19.164
Mm...

36:29.509 --> 36:32.170
Hi. Nadine is waiting in
your office to see you.

36:32.171 --> 36:33.905
Okay. Wh... Stevie's gone?

36:33.906 --> 36:36.840
Yes, Ma'am.

36:38.243 --> 36:39.677
Um, Ma'am...

36:39.678 --> 36:41.245
everything okay

36:41.246 --> 36:43.081
between you two?

36:43.082 --> 36:45.016
Thanks for looking after her today.

36:45.017 --> 36:47.218
Did you call home, tell
everybody you're all right?

36:47.219 --> 36:48.686
- Uh, yes, Ma'am.
- Friends, family?

36:48.687 --> 36:49.954
- Significant other?
- Yes.

36:49.955 --> 36:51.931
- Everyone's up to speed.
- Just want to make sure

36:51.932 --> 36:53.324
that you're taking care of your loved ones

36:53.325 --> 36:55.445
as well as you take care of mine.

36:58.830 --> 37:00.164
Oh, uh, before you go,

37:00.165 --> 37:02.533
find out what hospital
they took Mark Ferguson to.

37:02.534 --> 37:03.968
Yes, Ma'am.

37:03.969 --> 37:05.770
Hey, Nadine.

37:05.771 --> 37:07.004
Missed you today.

37:07.005 --> 37:09.774
I hope your lockdown was
less eventful than mine.

37:09.775 --> 37:12.410
I was locked in with a woman named

37:12.411 --> 37:14.979
Alice Millevoi who was
reassigned to Angola.

37:14.980 --> 37:16.981
She said others could have gone,

37:16.982 --> 37:19.216
but they all have
families, and she doesn't.

37:19.217 --> 37:20.949
She said that happens a lot.

37:20.950 --> 37:23.684
- Which it does, of course.
- I think we need

37:23.685 --> 37:26.081
to do a better job of making
these reassignments fair.

37:26.082 --> 37:27.381
These women are not expendable.

37:27.382 --> 37:28.583
I agree.

37:28.584 --> 37:29.918
Do whatever you have to do.

37:29.919 --> 37:31.119
You have my full support.

37:31.120 --> 37:32.600
Thank you.

37:33.655 --> 37:35.023
Vincent said he was going to leave

37:35.024 --> 37:37.092
the State Department
at the end of this term.

37:37.093 --> 37:38.927
If he had run for president,

37:38.928 --> 37:40.861
I would've had to disappear.

37:41.596 --> 37:42.931
Anyway...

37:42.932 --> 37:45.467
I'm done keeping his secrets.

37:45.468 --> 37:47.569
Well, they do have a way of
hitting you where you live.

37:47.570 --> 37:50.471
This is a bank letter he
asked me to keep for him.

37:50.472 --> 37:53.041
It's got an account number on it.

37:53.042 --> 37:56.110
And this is a document
I'd like you to sign.

37:56.111 --> 37:59.080
It says we're reassigning
Alice to Portugal.

37:59.081 --> 38:01.815
She deserves it.

38:10.625 --> 38:12.993
Hey.

38:13.861 --> 38:16.197
I forgot my keys.

38:16.198 --> 38:19.065
Kind of blows your whole
dramatic exit from before.

38:22.737 --> 38:25.339
Hell of a show you put on today, Mahoney.

38:27.309 --> 38:30.144
Yeah, you know,

38:30.145 --> 38:31.879
not exactly

38:31.880 --> 38:35.915
the grand gesture I would have chosen.

38:36.484 --> 38:38.184
How's Win?

38:39.453 --> 38:42.556
He's officially...

38:42.557 --> 38:44.958
my ex-fiancé.

38:49.264 --> 38:50.498
And he's nice,

38:50.499 --> 38:51.766
and...

38:51.767 --> 38:54.001
handsome...

38:54.002 --> 38:56.369
and easygoing...

38:57.938 --> 39:00.474
and deeply hurt.

39:00.475 --> 39:02.875
Look, what we did to him...

39:04.445 --> 39:06.914
...what I did to him...

39:06.915 --> 39:09.448
was really pretty terrible.

39:10.751 --> 39:12.419
Am I a terrible person?

39:12.420 --> 39:15.556
You're asking the wrong guy,

39:15.557 --> 39:17.391
because, um...

39:17.392 --> 39:22.229
I have seen you... at your most terrible,

39:22.230 --> 39:24.990
and I am still crazy about you.

39:25.432 --> 39:27.400
For what it's worth...

39:29.503 --> 39:31.872
I-I didn't want to hurt you.

39:31.873 --> 39:33.273
I'm...

39:34.442 --> 39:36.408
I'm sorry.

40:10.760 --> 40:13.798
Okay, while we wait for the
President just a few more shots.

40:28.595 --> 40:30.662
Okay... thank you.

40:31.397 --> 40:34.300
Yeah, um, I'm leaving, like, right now,

40:34.301 --> 40:38.571
so I should be there in 20... 20 minutes?

40:38.572 --> 40:41.107
Right.

40:41.108 --> 40:42.507
Cool, thanks.

40:43.142 --> 40:44.611
Yeah.

40:44.612 --> 40:46.978
Bye.

40:49.849 --> 40:51.818
I gotta go, Mom.

40:51.819 --> 40:54.654
Um, I'm just gonna stay with some friends,

40:54.655 --> 40:56.688
clear my head.

40:57.323 --> 40:59.625
But don't worry...

40:59.626 --> 41:02.961
I won't tell anyone.

41:05.531 --> 41:08.067
There was a boy at the market

41:08.068 --> 41:10.136
where Safeer's bomb went off,

41:10.137 --> 41:11.604
about Jason's age;

41:11.605 --> 41:14.172
a girl about Alison's...

41:16.676 --> 41:19.110
The scream that mother made...

41:20.146 --> 41:21.914
...when she I.D.'d the bodies.

41:21.915 --> 41:26.484
15 kids maimed or dead.

41:28.554 --> 41:31.090
To have the guy responsible

41:31.091 --> 41:34.393
right in front of you,

41:34.394 --> 41:36.595
to feel that rage

41:36.596 --> 41:38.397
for justice.

41:38.398 --> 41:41.267
I gave in to that.

41:41.268 --> 41:42.635
I did.

41:42.636 --> 41:44.770
It was still wrong.

41:44.771 --> 41:46.739
Not to mention, against the law.

41:46.740 --> 41:48.274
Technically, it wasn't.

41:48.275 --> 41:49.441
Technically?

41:49.442 --> 41:52.343
At the time, there were provisions.

41:53.178 --> 41:54.813
Vile...

41:54.814 --> 41:57.181
evil, bogus provisions?

41:58.717 --> 42:01.153
Ultimately, that's why I left.

42:01.154 --> 42:03.554
Yeah.

42:06.191 --> 42:08.431
And then you came home.

42:11.029 --> 42:12.531
You came home and you told us

42:12.532 --> 42:15.834
you'd been in Jordan the whole time.

42:15.835 --> 42:20.138
Very happy to just...

42:20.139 --> 42:22.506
pick up where you left off.

42:23.842 --> 42:25.676
Coach my soccer team.

42:27.713 --> 42:29.747
That's right.

42:30.949 --> 42:33.418
Wow.

42:33.419 --> 42:35.253
This is a lot.

42:35.254 --> 42:36.721
I-I'm sorry.

42:36.722 --> 42:39.357
I... You maybe don't want to...

42:39.358 --> 42:41.927
talk about it yet,

42:41.928 --> 42:44.896
or maybe you want some time.

42:44.897 --> 42:47.666
I wouldn't hold your breath.

42:47.667 --> 42:49.501
Hey, Stevie?

42:49.502 --> 42:52.637
If you never listen to anything I say again

42:52.638 --> 42:54.739
for the rest of your life,

42:54.740 --> 42:56.474
please hear this:

42:56.475 --> 42:59.177
Everything is more complicated
than you think it is right now.

42:59.178 --> 43:01.413
And the only way you come to know that

43:01.414 --> 43:04.681
is through experience.

43:05.683 --> 43:08.286
And that's what this whole process

43:08.287 --> 43:10.755
of growing up is all about.

43:10.756 --> 43:11.990
Yeah.

43:11.991 --> 43:13.890
I know.

43:18.463 --> 43:20.831
I gotta go do that now.

43:29.984 --> 43:38.153
