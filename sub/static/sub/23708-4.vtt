she probably knew that her life

03:26.940 --> 03:28.072
WILDMAN:
But accepting this role

03:28.074 --> 03:30.809
comes with a tremendous risk.

03:30.811 --> 03:35.280
She knew that if she was caught,
she would be tried

03:35.282 --> 03:39.351
and hanged as a traitor.

03:39.353 --> 03:43.188
In late spring, Cushman heads
south into Tennessee,

03:43.190 --> 03:45.691
and pretty quickly,
she gets results.

03:45.693 --> 03:49.895
She was able to talk to
many of the officers,

03:49.897 --> 03:53.398
and just with her wit
and her charm and her stories,

03:53.400 --> 03:57.535
she was able to find information
about the numbers of soldiers

03:57.537 --> 04:00.105
and where, strategically,
they might be moving next.

04:00.107 --> 04:04.643

Because Cushman was such
an appealing character,

she was invited into many
of the officers' circles.

They didn't, apparently,
have much concern

04:20.594 --> 04:22.994

When no one was looking,
she rolled them up,

04:41.315 --> 04:44.616
and she took them,
and she shoved them in her boot.

WILDMAN: Cushman flees the camp,
but she doesn't get far.

MAHER: And the documents were
discovered, so she is arrested.

04:54.261 --> 04:56.361
This could be the end
for Cushman.

04:56.363 --> 04:58.362
WILDMAN: The Confederates

04:58.364 --> 05:01.433

to death by hanging,

05:01.435 --> 05:04.202
but she has one more
trick up her sleeve.

05:04.204 --> 05:08.707
There's far more to Cushman
than a pretty face.

05:08.709 --> 05:11.509
WILDMAN: Knowing her execution
date is fast approaching,

05:11.511 --> 05:14.446
Cushman needs to come up

of a lifetime.

05:29.963 --> 05:31.263

to hang a dying woman.

The act buys Cushman
just enough time.

scheduled to be hanged,

05:40.540 --> 05:43.108
the Union Army advances
into Tennessee,

05:43.110 --> 05:46.211

are forced to retreat.

cesium-137,

23:45.608 --> 23:49.109

he writes it onto paper.

to his daughter,
