WEBVTT

00:11.470 --> 00:12.721
DRIVER: Whoa!

00:17.476 --> 00:18.852
And just who might you be?

00:18.936 --> 00:20.096
I'm the man who's
going to relieve you

00:20.229 --> 00:22.766
of that chest full of gold
you're transporting.

00:23.191 --> 00:24.271
(LAUGHS)

00:26.277 --> 00:27.312
You and what army?

00:27.445 --> 00:29.606
Well, I'm glad you asked.

00:37.830 --> 00:41.823
Your choice.
Save your lives or the gold.

00:43.294 --> 00:44.409
Retreat!

00:55.306 --> 00:56.466
Smee?

00:59.018 --> 01:01.384
Those arrows took
a lot longer to light than discussed.

01:01.479 --> 01:03.640
It wasn't easy lighting all of them
by ourselves, Captain.

01:05.066 --> 01:06.897
Maybe if we had an actual army...

01:08.110 --> 01:10.192
And share in the spoils?

01:10.321 --> 01:11.310
(SCOFFS)

01:11.447 --> 01:12.903
I think not.

01:13.783 --> 01:18.152
I gotta say, it's good to be
at your side again, sir.

01:20.414 --> 01:21.449
And not as a rat.

01:21.540 --> 01:23.917
That's a lovely side effect
of the curse breaking for you,

01:24.001 --> 01:25.081
I'd imagine.

01:25.169 --> 01:28.661
SMEE: I did like the mobility,
but being human is good, too.

01:32.969 --> 01:36.427
What did I tell you, mates?
You don't need a ship to be a pirate.

01:36.514 --> 01:38.004
(ALL LAUGHING)

01:40.810 --> 01:42.095
Come on, one more.

01:42.186 --> 01:43.426
One more.

01:43.521 --> 01:44.510
Oh.

01:44.730 --> 01:48.598
To the most clever dastardly band
of pirates to ever set...

01:48.693 --> 01:50.024
(LAUGHS)

01:50.361 --> 01:52.443
Stride on the open roads.

01:52.530 --> 01:53.861
To Captain Hook!

01:54.031 --> 01:55.942
-(ALL CHEERING)
-Hey!

01:56.033 --> 01:57.534
Wait, wait, wait!

01:58.661 --> 02:02.870
The boys and l chipped in
and got you something.

02:06.460 --> 02:09.577
Oh. Mr. Smee. How did you know?

02:13.467 --> 02:14.547
Enjoy.

02:14.802 --> 02:16.303
(MEN LAUGHING)

02:16.387 --> 02:17.593
To Captain Hook!

02:17.680 --> 02:19.216
(ALL CHEERING)

02:22.518 --> 02:23.553
Come on! One more.

02:32.403 --> 02:35.611
I don't understand.
Your men took care of me.

02:35.698 --> 02:39.361
And tomorrow, you shall tell them
that you had a grand time. Good night.

02:44.498 --> 02:45.749
(SIGHS)

02:49.545 --> 02:50.534
(GROANS)

02:51.005 --> 02:52.120
Ah.

02:53.924 --> 02:55.789
Move and I'll slit your throat.

02:55.885 --> 02:59.298
Not a good plan for you.
I'm guessing you don't know who I am?

02:59.388 --> 03:02.255
I know exactly who you are,
Captain Hook.

03:03.267 --> 03:04.632
Well, then I'm at a disadvantage.

03:08.647 --> 03:10.103
My name is Ariel.

03:10.191 --> 03:12.682
And you're going to pay
for what you've done.

03:23.412 --> 03:26.449
DAVID: I've seen enemy battle plans
that were easier to decode than this.

03:26.540 --> 03:27.916
Let me see.

03:31.504 --> 03:36.498
All right, it says,
"Take screws E with washers D

03:36.592 --> 03:41.677
"through bar C using wrench F,"
which is...

03:43.057 --> 03:44.137
Not provided.

03:44.308 --> 03:46.845
Do you want me to just call Marco?
He's really good at this sort of thing.

03:46.936 --> 03:48.267
-No!
-No! We're fine!

03:49.063 --> 03:50.644
Should we even be doing this?

03:50.731 --> 03:53.108
Ever since the showdown between
Regina and the Wicked Witch,

03:53.192 --> 03:55.228
we haven't seen Zelena or Gold at all.

03:55.319 --> 03:57.230
Shouldn't we be focusing
on her next move?

03:57.321 --> 03:59.186
We are. We just can't stop living.

03:59.281 --> 04:03.650
Yeah. And this crib is a statement.
We're not going to lose another baby.

04:04.036 --> 04:06.869
-(DOOR CLOSES)
-And thanks to me, you won't.

04:08.249 --> 04:09.739
I'm finished.

04:09.834 --> 04:11.449
So, did it work?

04:11.544 --> 04:13.159
Were you able to put up
a new protection spell?

04:13.254 --> 04:15.836
One that can't be undone
by blood magic.

04:15.923 --> 04:19.507
Which means Zelena won't be able
to put her hands on that baby.

04:20.010 --> 04:21.170
(SIGHS)

04:21.595 --> 04:23.210
Any idea why she would want to?

04:23.305 --> 04:26.593
The number of spells involving
baby parts would surprise you.

04:27.726 --> 04:31.389
That greeny is clearly one twisted witch.

04:31.480 --> 04:33.516
But as long as we're in here, we're safe.

04:34.024 --> 04:35.275
That's useless.

04:35.359 --> 04:38.146
I think we need to stop playing defense
and start taking the fight to her.

04:38.737 --> 04:40.819
Did you not see
how I barely outwitted her yesterday?

04:41.657 --> 04:43.773
She has magic. Powerful magic.

04:43.868 --> 04:44.903
l have magic, too.

04:44.994 --> 04:48.612
You've seen me use it.
| just can't always control it.

04:48.706 --> 04:51.664
But if we teamed up...
If you taught me...

04:51.750 --> 04:53.741
Now, why does this fee! so familiar?

04:53.836 --> 04:55.042
I'm ready this time.

04:55.671 --> 04:57.411
Okay.

04:57.506 --> 04:59.883
But if we do this, we do this my way.

04:59.967 --> 05:03.130
This isn't drinking stale coffee
at a stakeout

05:04.346 --> 05:06.883
or whatever you did
as a bail bondsperson.

05:08.893 --> 05:11.851
This is a way of life.

05:12.855 --> 05:15.517
-You have to fully commit to it.
-Not a problem.

05:19.528 --> 05:22.190
Meet me in my vault in one hour.

05:28.537 --> 05:29.526
And no complaining.

05:29.622 --> 05:32.864
I'm doing this. It's the only way.
And yes, I will be careful.

05:32.958 --> 05:34.118
-We know.
-And don't worry,

05:34.210 --> 05:36.121
we'll watch Henry
when he gets back from the store.

05:38.839 --> 05:40.750
Actually, I'm not sure
that's the best idea.

05:41.967 --> 05:43.047
What? What is it?

05:45.721 --> 05:47.882
Well, you guys are tired.
You need to rest.

05:49.099 --> 05:50.964
I'm pregnant, I'm not sick with the flu.

05:55.022 --> 05:56.353
Well, it's...

05:57.691 --> 05:58.726
"Cradle cap."

05:58.817 --> 06:01.354
Last time you guys had him,
you oven/vhelmed him with baby tips.

06:01.445 --> 06:03.811
He's 12. He's doesn't want to
talk about pregnancies. It's not fun.

06:03.906 --> 06:04.986
Oh, we're fun.

06:05.074 --> 06:07.156
Well, l'mjust saying
maybe Henry disagrees.

06:07.243 --> 06:08.608
No!

06:10.454 --> 06:13.116
He'll get there. You gotta remember,
he doesn't know who you are.

06:13.207 --> 06:15.573
Well, if we're not fun, who is?

06:18.087 --> 06:19.918
SMEE: Captain Hook. Captain?

06:20.005 --> 06:22.747
It's about time, Mr. Smee.

06:22.841 --> 06:25.628
You know how much I abhor waiting.

06:28.138 --> 06:30.299
It's just me and the men
were talking about

06:30.391 --> 06:34.384
how we haven't seen much of you
since we all ended up back here.

06:34.478 --> 06:37.811
Is there a point
to that rather odd observation?

06:38.524 --> 06:41.061
What's keeping us
from crewing up again?

06:41.151 --> 06:43.278
Hitting the high seas,
getting back to pirating?

06:43.362 --> 06:47.480
You mean, other than being attacked
and turned into flying monkeys?

06:47.575 --> 06:50.612
Have you forgotten, there's no
safe passage out of this town?

06:50.703 --> 06:52.443
You've already been a rodent,
Mr. Smee.

06:52.538 --> 06:54.199
Does life as a simian
interest you as well?

06:54.290 --> 06:56.997
Of course there's safe passage.
We could outrun them.

06:57.084 --> 06:58.324
Not with that torso of yours.

06:58.419 --> 07:00.626
If we had a fast enough ship.
The Jolly Roger, for instance.

07:00.713 --> 07:02.123
You still haven't told me
whether you found her

07:02.214 --> 07:03.670
during the time
none of us can remember.

07:03.757 --> 07:05.873
What happened during that time
isn't important.

07:05.968 --> 07:08.380
Because you remember.

07:08.470 --> 07:10.961
-Is our ship okay? What happened to it?
-My ship.

07:11.515 --> 07:14.678
And all you need to know, Mr. Smee,
is that the Jolly Roger isn't here.

07:14.768 --> 07:16.804
So there will be no outrunning
of anything.

07:17.813 --> 07:19.929
I mean, what if we found another ship?
Any one of these...

07:20.024 --> 07:21.639
Mr. Smee,
I've tried letting you down easy,

07:21.734 --> 07:22.940
now let me be more direct.

07:23.027 --> 07:26.519
l have no intention of leaving this town.

07:28.824 --> 07:33.067
Captain, I agree with you,
this place has its bright spots.

07:33.162 --> 07:36.746
l have never tried anything
quite like frozen yogurt before.

07:38.042 --> 07:40.078
But the Wicked Witch is here.

07:40.169 --> 07:43.081
With that sort of danger, what
possible reason do you have to stay?

07:45.090 --> 07:49.629
My reasons are my own.
Question them again at your peril.

07:49.720 --> 07:51.176
Sir.

07:52.181 --> 07:53.762
EMMA: Wait here, okay?

07:55.434 --> 07:56.890
Didn't he used to be a rat?

07:56.977 --> 08:00.060
Aye. In many ways, he still is.

08:01.565 --> 08:03.396
To what do I owe the pleasure, Swan?

08:03.484 --> 08:06.521
l, um... lwas wondering
if you could take care of Henry again.

08:07.738 --> 08:09.854
If you want to get close to me,
you just have to ask.

08:09.948 --> 08:11.654
There's no need to use the lad
as an excuse.

08:12.242 --> 08:14.028
Why am I not surprised
you're making this about you?

08:15.037 --> 08:19.280
I need your help, because Regina
needs to train me in magic.

08:19.375 --> 08:22.367
We think together we might be able
to defeat the Wicked Witch.

08:22.461 --> 08:25.953
That's the first reasonable plan
I've heard since this all began.

08:27.299 --> 08:28.539
Magic is part of you, Swan.

08:28.634 --> 08:31.842
Don't forget, lwas there
when Cora tried to steal your heart.

08:31.929 --> 08:35.342
I saw the power inside of you.
It's about time you embraced it.

08:35.432 --> 08:36.467
It's what makes you the Savior.

08:36.558 --> 08:38.219
I'm not embracing anything.

08:39.186 --> 08:41.928
I need to learn magic to defeat Zelena
and make sure everyone here is safe.

08:42.022 --> 08:43.057
After that, I'm done.

08:44.775 --> 08:46.185
Done with what, exactly?

08:49.154 --> 08:51.019
He doesn't belong here. Not anymore.

08:51.115 --> 08:52.400
He belongs in the real world.

08:52.491 --> 08:56.075
In New York.
In the life that he remembers.

08:56.161 --> 09:00.074
It was good.
And it didn't involve vile villains.

09:00.165 --> 09:02.907
What about the life you remember?

09:03.001 --> 09:06.960
You can'tjust pretend
like this never happened. Trust me.

09:08.173 --> 09:10.630
I spent the last year
trying to do just that.

09:10.718 --> 09:13.960
Return to the person I used to be,
and it didn't work.

09:14.054 --> 09:17.592
Why? What happened over
the last year that you're not telling me?

09:17.683 --> 09:21.050
Hmmmmnm.
Just take it from me. Just this once.

09:22.646 --> 09:25.979
No matter how much you wish
you could go back to your old life,

09:28.026 --> 09:29.482
you can't.

09:34.032 --> 09:36.523
We can'tjust sit back and do nothing.

09:37.953 --> 09:39.318
You're right.

09:39.413 --> 09:43.201
Hey, we can be as fun
as any pirate captain.

09:43.292 --> 09:45.248
Exactly.

09:45.335 --> 09:47.462
Henry obviously did a lot of growing up
in the past year.

09:47.546 --> 09:50.333
We just have to adjust accordingly.

09:50.758 --> 09:52.544
(PEOPLE CLAMORING)

09:52.634 --> 09:54.499
What's going on?

what happened?

09:56.430 --> 09:58.295

MARY: Who did? Who's here?

10:08.233 --> 10:09.643
Ariel?

10:16.074 --> 10:19.282
Where have you been? We thought
you'd been turned into a monkey.

10:19.369 --> 10:22.111
A monkey?
No, I'm a girl that turns into a fish.

10:22.206 --> 10:25.039
Yeah. We know.
But what happened to you?

10:26.293 --> 10:28.625
I've been under the sea, searching.

10:28.712 --> 10:31.704
I've traveled to every known realm
looking for Prince Eric.

10:32.758 --> 10:34.589
So he's missing? For how long?

10:34.676 --> 10:37.804
After Pan failed,
I woke up here like everybody else.

10:37.888 --> 10:39.719
I couldn't find him.

10:40.390 --> 10:43.678
I didn't understand what happened
until I overheard everybody saying

10:43.769 --> 10:45.600
that we had all gone
to the enchanted forest

10:45.687 --> 10:47.097
and been there for a year
without knowing it.

10:47.189 --> 10:49.180
So you still don't know
what happened to him?

10:49.274 --> 10:50.810
That's why I came back here.

10:50.901 --> 10:52.687
I thought maybe
l'd overlooked something,

10:52.778 --> 10:54.109
that he'd be here.

10:55.531 --> 10:57.192
But obviously you haven't seen him.

10:57.282 --> 10:58.897
We're sorry.

10:58.992 --> 11:01.529
We've been trying to piece together
what happened.

11:01.620 --> 11:05.363
All we know is that we're up against
Regina's sister, the Wicked Witch.

11:05.958 --> 11:07.823
Do you think that
she might be responsible

11:07.918 --> 11:09.874
for Prince Eric's disappearance?

11:09.962 --> 11:11.873
Without our memories,
it's impossible to know everything.

11:13.590 --> 11:15.751
Maybe for us, but what about Hook?

11:15.843 --> 11:17.674
The pirate?

11:17.761 --> 11:20.047
Yes. He wasn't part
of the Witch's curse.

11:20.138 --> 11:21.218
He has his memories.

11:21.306 --> 11:22.386
Maybe he can, I don't know,

11:22.474 --> 11:24.339
shed some light
on what happened to Prince Eric.

11:24.434 --> 11:25.469
Well, do you think he'd help me?

11:26.144 --> 11:27.224
He helped us save Henry.

11:27.312 --> 11:29.428
I don't know why not.

11:31.441 --> 11:33.147
For fear of adding insult to injury,

11:33.277 --> 11:37.236
would you mind catching me up
on your particular grievance?

11:37.322 --> 11:39.813
You kidnapped Prince Eric!
And you're going to return him to me.

11:39.950 --> 11:41.611
Now on your feet!

11:42.536 --> 11:45.949
Kidnapping a prince does sound
like something I would do...

(GROANS)

11:48.750 --> 11:50.206

11:50.294 --> 11:52.876
...but I'm afraid
you've got the wrong pirate.

11:52.963 --> 11:56.501
Or should I say
the wrong pirate has you.

11:56.633 --> 12:00.626
Go ahead, kill me,
but I still know you're lying.

12:00.721 --> 12:03.884
One of Eric's men escaped, so I know
the ship that took him was yours.

12:03.974 --> 12:06.215
The Jolly Roger!

12:07.978 --> 12:11.141
The Jolly Roger? Are you certain?

12:12.733 --> 12:14.143
Answer me!

12:17.154 --> 12:19.361
You really didn't take him.

12:19.489 --> 12:22.902
What else do you know
about who's captaining my ship?

12:22.993 --> 12:25.234
Did that man tell you anything else?

12:25.329 --> 12:29.493
Only that he was able to escape with
a weapon that he stole from the armory.

12:29.583 --> 12:30.993
The dagger that's against my throat.

12:44.681 --> 12:45.966
(LAUGHS)

12:49.394 --> 12:50.850
(SNORING)

12:54.858 --> 12:57.565
Rise and shine, you bilge rats!
No offense, Mr. Smee.

12:57.694 --> 13:01.687
None taken. I keep dreaming of cheese.

13:01.782 --> 13:02.988
What is it?

13:03.075 --> 13:05.532
I know who has the Jolly Roger!
And we're going to take her back!

13:06.703 --> 13:08.534
Whose funeral
shall we be attending, sir?

13:10.540 --> 13:12.531
-Black Beard.
-Black Beard?

13:14.628 --> 13:17.620
But he's the most cutthroat pirate
ever to hoist a sail. l...

13:18.423 --> 13:20.209
After you, of course.

13:20.300 --> 13:21.506
Which will make it
all the more satisfying

13:21.593 --> 13:24.050
when I take my ship back
and make him walk her lovely plank.

13:24.972 --> 13:26.462
Let's not be hasty.

13:26.556 --> 13:28.296
We've been having fun
robbing carriages.

13:28.392 --> 13:30.132
Getting rich from it, too.

13:30.227 --> 13:31.888
Maybe we should forget
about the Jolly Roger.

13:31.979 --> 13:34.015
You said it yourself,
we don't need a ship to be...

13:34.106 --> 13:35.687
She's notjust a ship.

13:35.774 --> 13:37.355
I'm fairly certain she is.

13:37.442 --> 13:39.057
She's more than that.

13:42.406 --> 13:44.192
I haven't been myself
since we've returned

13:44.992 --> 13:47.108
and I should have realized
the reason why.

13:48.161 --> 13:49.446
It's because I don't have her.

13:49.579 --> 13:53.447
"Her"? You talk about the vessel
as though she's a woman.

13:53.583 --> 13:57.872
Women come and go, Mr. Smee.
But a pirate's life? It's forever.

13:57.963 --> 14:01.421
Still, Captain.
I doubt we could even find Black Beard.

14:01.508 --> 14:04.295
Well, don't be a coward.

14:04.428 --> 14:07.340
I know where he moors his vessels.
It's less than a day's trek.

14:07.431 --> 14:09.217
And then I'll have my ship again.

14:09.307 --> 14:11.093
And I will have my prince.

14:12.936 --> 14:16.349
Few people have held a dagger
to my throat and lived to tell the tale.

14:16.440 --> 14:18.146
l'd leave before I change my mind.

14:18.275 --> 14:22.518
No. I've crossed paths
with enough pirates to know your code.

14:22.612 --> 14:25.524
"Any valuable information
a pirate captain ascertains

14:25.615 --> 14:28.357
"shall be compensated in equal favor."

14:29.619 --> 14:30.654
I think she's right.

14:33.498 --> 14:35.784
So? When do we leave?

14:40.797 --> 14:42.048
(CHUCKLES)

14:43.633 --> 14:45.624
You want to know the secret to winning?

14:45.719 --> 14:46.879
Practice?

14:46.970 --> 14:49.382
No, my boy. Loaded dice.

14:50.891 --> 14:52.051
That's cheating.

14:52.142 --> 14:53.473
Only if you get caught.

14:54.019 --> 14:55.680
I think it's cheating either way.

14:55.812 --> 14:58.019
The point is, you win.

15:02.486 --> 15:04.192
Practice, huh?

15:09.451 --> 15:13.114
Ah, Hook, this is a friend of ours, Ariel.

15:13.205 --> 15:16.038
She's looking for someone who didn't
return to Storybrooke with the rest of us.

15:16.124 --> 15:18.501
He's from a maritime kingdom
and he loved to sail.

15:18.668 --> 15:21.580
Perhaps you came across him
on the high seas?

15:21.671 --> 15:22.751
His name's Prince Eric.

15:26.676 --> 15:30.009
Sorry, lass, lwish I could help,
but I've never heard of him.

15:43.944 --> 15:45.400
Don't touch anything.

15:46.905 --> 15:48.987
How am I supposed to learn magic
if I can't touch anything?

15:49.074 --> 15:50.985
The same way I did with Rumple.

15:51.076 --> 15:53.692
We're going to create
a solid foundation first,

15:53.787 --> 15:57.496
and then build your skills
from the ground up.

15:57.582 --> 16:00.790
I said, don't touch.

16:04.089 --> 16:07.627
So, while we're here,
who's looking after Henry?

16:07.717 --> 16:09.048
The Un-Charmings?

16:10.095 --> 16:11.130
Actually, Hook is.

16:13.390 --> 16:16.097
Well, those two have been
spending a lot of time together lately.

16:16.226 --> 16:18.558
Hook's good with Henry.
And Henry likes him.

16:18.645 --> 16:22.229
He's prone to violence, impulsive,
and has a hook for a hand.

16:22.315 --> 16:24.055
What about him
would a 12—year—old boy not like?

16:24.151 --> 16:25.357
I trust him.

16:25.443 --> 16:27.650
He brought me back to Storybrooke
and he didn't have to.

16:27.737 --> 16:29.273
Of course he brought you back.

16:29.406 --> 16:31.271
What's that supposed to mean?

16:31.408 --> 16:32.739
Seriously?

16:32.826 --> 16:33.861
You're going to pretend

16:33.952 --> 16:37.160
everyone doesn't see
the yearning looks and doe-y eyes?

16:37.247 --> 16:38.737
I don't yearn.

16:38.832 --> 16:41.414
Well, maybe. But he does.

16:44.921 --> 16:48.630
Let's start with roots for incantations.

16:49.467 --> 16:52.209
You kidding me right now?
What language is this? Spanish?

16:52.304 --> 16:55.467
We're not making tapas.
We're making magic.

16:56.600 --> 16:59.558
It's Elvish. WeII, half-Elvish.

16:59.644 --> 17:02.932
I'm never going to get this.
Is this how Rumple taught you?

17:03.023 --> 17:05.514
Just think about your training.
What other methods did he use?

17:05.609 --> 17:06.974
Rumple was a bully.

17:07.110 --> 17:10.648
He didn't suffer fools and
he certainly didn't coddle his students.

17:10.780 --> 17:14.614
And if he tried to teach you how to swim
and you couldn't learn, you drowned.

17:16.286 --> 17:17.776
Drowned?

17:18.788 --> 17:19.868
That's it.

17:19.956 --> 17:20.945
That's what?

17:22.959 --> 17:23.948
Ah!

17:25.795 --> 17:27.376
What the hell are you doing?

17:27.464 --> 17:28.624
Teaching you to swim.

17:36.806 --> 17:38.057
Come on. Think hard, Hook.

17:38.141 --> 17:40.302
Are you sure you can't remember
anything that can be useful?

17:40.435 --> 17:41.470
My apologies, mate.

17:41.603 --> 17:43.139
But if I'd run across a prince
during my adventure,

17:43.271 --> 17:45.011
I think I'd remember it.

17:45.148 --> 17:46.979
ljust... I don't understand.

17:47.108 --> 17:48.609
How could he vanish
without a trace?

17:49.653 --> 17:52.520
That's it. Maybe he didn't.

17:52.656 --> 17:53.645
What do you mean?

17:53.782 --> 17:55.898
When the curse brought us back here,
it brought our things, too.

17:55.992 --> 17:57.277
Gold's shop is filled with them.

17:57.369 --> 18:00.281
And if we find something of Eric's,
we can use a locator spell to track him.

18:00.372 --> 18:01.487
Let's go!

18:01.581 --> 18:03.367
Sounds like a plan.
Best of luck with that.

18:03.458 --> 18:05.119
Wait. No, you should come with us.

18:05.210 --> 18:07.826
You might remember something
that we won't or can't.

18:07.963 --> 18:09.169
You'd be far more helpful than us.

18:09.839 --> 18:11.295
Well, someone has to
keep an eye on the boy.

18:11.383 --> 18:13.169
Well, Mary Margaret and I
can take over.

18:14.052 --> 18:16.134
Could we have a talk for a moment?

18:18.765 --> 18:20.266
(SIGHS)

18:22.352 --> 18:23.387
What is it?

18:23.520 --> 18:25.306
Are you sure
this is such a good idea, mate?

18:25.397 --> 18:27.558
Let's be honest,
there's only one obvious explanation

18:27.691 --> 18:29.556
why Little Mermaid here
can't find her prince.

18:29.693 --> 18:30.933
He's dead.

18:31.027 --> 18:32.813
There's no reason to ply her
with false hope.

18:32.904 --> 18:36.522
(SIGHS) In my experience,
there's no such thing.

18:37.200 --> 18:40.283
You just have to believe.
Now go. Good luck.

18:56.720 --> 18:58.335
ARIEL: Trudge. Trudge. Trudge.

18:58.430 --> 19:01.422
If you ask me, there's nothing
more boring than land travel.

19:01.558 --> 19:03.970
-(HOOK SIGHS)
-I'Il take my tail and the ocean any day.

19:04.060 --> 19:07.223
That's one thing we can agree on.
Minus the tail, of course.

19:07.355 --> 19:10.392
You won't be bored for much longer.
Our destination is just past this rise.

19:10.525 --> 19:12.891
Then it won't be long until I'm reunited...

19:13.695 --> 19:14.935
Here. Allow me.

19:18.825 --> 19:20.065
You've ripped it!

19:20.910 --> 19:21.945
It's a cloak.

19:22.078 --> 19:26.071
It's Eric's cloak.
And he's had it since before we met.

19:26.207 --> 19:28.243
He left it with me while he was away
to keep him close.

19:28.376 --> 19:30.037
And now you have ruined it.

19:30.128 --> 19:31.664
If mending a cloak
is our biggest obstacle,

19:31.755 --> 19:33.962
we're in fine shape.

19:34.090 --> 19:36.877
You realize you might not find him?
Or survive?

19:38.428 --> 19:39.417
IWiII.

19:40.764 --> 19:43.506
Didn't you see the fear Black Beard's
name struck into my crew?

19:44.100 --> 19:46.637
You don't become a pirate captain
through mercy.

19:46.770 --> 19:49.728
If I were you,
I would prepare myself for the worst.

19:50.732 --> 19:54.850
Why? What are you saying,
that you would kill Eric if you had him?

19:54.944 --> 19:57.151
You don't believe that?

19:57.280 --> 19:59.396
Well, honestly,
I was a little surprised to hear

19:59.491 --> 20:01.903
that you might be responsible
for Eric's kidnapping.

20:01.993 --> 20:03.108
After the stories that I've heard.

20:03.244 --> 20:04.905
What stories?

20:04.996 --> 20:07.203
Well, the ones of

20:07.290 --> 20:09.531
you helping reunite Snow White
and her family in Neverland.

20:09.626 --> 20:10.957
Some people say that you're a hero.

20:14.255 --> 20:16.166
Look, don't believe
every story you hear.

20:20.470 --> 20:23.303
Being good
is nothing to be ashamed of.

20:23.431 --> 20:26.639
People change. Look at me.

20:26.768 --> 20:29.259
Ihavelegs
and I fell in love with a human.

20:29.354 --> 20:31.140
I don't think anyone saw that coming.

20:31.272 --> 20:33.763
You may have changed, I haven't.

20:34.984 --> 20:37.600
I'm a pirate and I always will be.

20:46.496 --> 20:48.703
-Belle?
-Ariel?

20:50.625 --> 20:54.493
Where have you been?
I was worried I'd never see you again.

20:54.629 --> 20:55.664
I've been looking for Eric.

20:55.797 --> 20:57.879
He's been missing
since we all returned.

20:58.007 --> 21:01.545
We were hoping
we could find something of his here.

21:02.137 --> 21:05.049
Oh, of course,
to see if he's in Storybrooke.

21:05.181 --> 21:06.557
Have you seen anything of his?

21:06.683 --> 21:09.299
I, uh... Ionlyjust started
sorting through things,

21:11.020 --> 21:13.056
but, uh, don't despair. Let's start looking.

21:13.189 --> 21:14.565
-Okay.
-Okay.

21:27.704 --> 21:28.910
(CHUCKLES)

21:29.247 --> 21:31.203
I've been wondering where you went.

21:55.565 --> 21:59.023
That's Eric's!
How did you know that was his?

22:00.361 --> 22:01.737
I, uh... Iwasn't sure.

22:02.280 --> 22:03.895
I saw the sea creature clasp

22:05.074 --> 22:06.939
and remembered
he was from a maritime kingdom.

22:07.076 --> 22:11.490
He is! He was! And now he's here.

22:21.090 --> 22:22.341
Are you out of your mind?

22:22.425 --> 22:27.385
Every time you've exhibited your power,
it's been spurred by your instincts.

22:27.472 --> 22:31.806
So today,
we're going to push those instincts

22:32.769 --> 22:33.929
until you master them.

22:34.062 --> 22:35.677
A little reading
doesn't sound so bad now.

22:35.772 --> 22:36.887
You can stop me.

22:36.981 --> 22:38.096
Stop you from what?

No, you stop it.

23:04.008 --> 23:06.795
No more hand-holding.
You have to do this.

23:06.928 --> 23:08.543
Reach into your gut.

23:08.638 --> 23:10.720
You know you can do this.

23:10.807 --> 23:12.138
It's inside you, Emma.

23:30.660 --> 23:31.866
Did I...

23:32.787 --> 23:34.323
Did I just do that?

23:34.455 --> 23:36.366
Yes.

23:36.499 --> 23:39.662
When all Iwanted
was for you to retie the rope!

23:41.337 --> 23:44.579
It's like you said, instinct.

23:45.300 --> 23:46.540
Why are you pissed? I did it.

23:46.676 --> 23:48.837
Why does it matter how?

23:48.970 --> 23:52.133
You think I'm mad
because you didn't listen to me?

23:52.223 --> 23:56.262
I'm mad because
look at all of this potential inside of you!

23:56.352 --> 23:58.308
And you've been wasting it!

This is the locator spell.

24:08.406 --> 24:11.739

becomes enchanted

25:21.062 --> 25:25.431
Now, if the coward who tried stealing
her from me would kindly show his face,

25:26.734 --> 25:28.599
I'll give him the punishment
he deserves.

25:34.283 --> 25:35.614
BLACK BEARD: Gladly.

25:40.915 --> 25:43.031
But it's not me who'll be punished.

25:46.462 --> 25:49.920
You want your ship back?
Then take it.

26:35.845 --> 26:38.678
Word on the waten/vays
is Captain Hook had gone soft.

your guts spilling on this deck.

Well, I'll be happy to oblige.

27:28.397 --> 27:30.353
Wait! Eric's not on board!

27:30.441 --> 27:32.352
You have to get him to tell you
where he is!

27:35.321 --> 27:36.857
You heard the lady. Where is he?

27:37.615 --> 27:39.025
So that's what this was?

27:39.116 --> 27:42.108
A rescue mission for some wench? Ha!

27:42.745 --> 27:45.452
They were right about you, Hook.
You have gone soft.

27:45.581 --> 27:47.242
I can either make this painful...

27:48.376 --> 27:51.584
Or quite painful. Now answer.

27:52.922 --> 27:56.085
l have him stashed safe and sound
on a deserted island.

27:56.217 --> 27:58.378
Only I know where.

27:58.469 --> 28:00.255
l was planning to ransom him
when the time was right.

28:00.930 --> 28:02.545
Whatever it is, I'll pay it.

28:02.640 --> 28:04.676
Money's not what I'm after anymore.

28:04.767 --> 28:06.507
Then what is it that you want?

28:06.602 --> 28:11.517
The satisfaction of proving
Captain Hook is no longer a pirate.

28:11.607 --> 28:13.598
And how are you going to prove that?

28:13.734 --> 28:15.770
By giving you a choice.

28:17.613 --> 28:21.697
Surrender the Jolly Roger to me and
I'll tell you where I'm holding her prince.

28:22.577 --> 28:25.740
Or refuse and he dies along with me.

28:34.964 --> 28:38.377

Maybe he's on one of those boats.

28:56.402 --> 28:57.858

29:04.493 --> 29:08.657
If the spell worked
and it's taken us to Eric,

29:10.499 --> 29:11.705

rather spend time with a pirate than us.

34:14.011 --> 34:15.467

Who believes that a ship can fill a void
left by a broken heart.

35:18.575 --> 35:20.566
After she left you on your beloved ship,

35:20.703 --> 35:24.412
she actually found where Black Beard
had been keeping her prince.

35:24.540 --> 35:25.871
She found him?

35:26.375 --> 35:27.831
How do you know that?

35:27.918 --> 35:31.126
My spies are always circling, Captain.
Through every realm.

35:31.213 --> 35:33.124
Always circling.

35:33.215 --> 35:35.046
She found him on Hangman's lsland,

35:35.134 --> 35:36.795
which was outside the force
of the curse.

35:36.885 --> 35:41.003
They've been living happily ever after
ever since.

35:41.098 --> 35:42.884
Don't you just love a good twist?

35:45.060 --> 35:47.267
I don't understand.
Why would you pretend to be her?

35:48.105 --> 35:50.187
To corrupt your love.

35:50.274 --> 35:51.855
As I said earlier,

35:51.942 --> 35:55.434
I've known about your dirty little secret
for quite some time.

35:55.571 --> 35:58.984
Seen the guilt on your face
over the decision you made that day.

35:59.074 --> 36:03.568
I knew it haunted you
and I knew I could use it.

36:03.662 --> 36:05.323
Use it for what?

36:05.414 --> 36:07.370
When you invoked
the name of your love

36:07.458 --> 36:10.165
in a selfish plea for redemption,
l was able to curse you.

36:10.252 --> 36:12.959
More specifically, your kiss.

36:13.630 --> 36:18.795
See, the next time your lips
touch Emma Swan's,

36:18.927 --> 36:21.464
all of her magic will be taken.

36:21.597 --> 36:26.341
Everything that makes her special,
that makes her powerful,

36:26.435 --> 36:28.096
that makes her a threat

36:28.937 --> 36:30.438
will be gone.

36:31.607 --> 36:32.767
I won't do it.

36:33.650 --> 36:35.186
I'll tell her.

36:35.277 --> 36:36.778
And then she'll defeat you.

36:36.862 --> 36:39.604
Then I'll send the Dark One to kill her
before you can.

36:41.992 --> 36:43.983
No, you won't.

36:47.331 --> 36:50.573
If you could have killed her,
you would have.

36:50.667 --> 36:53.079
You need her power removed.

36:53.170 --> 36:55.707
It's why you didn't kill her
when she came to the town.

36:55.798 --> 37:00.542
It's why you had a monkey look after her
in New York instead of killing her.

37:01.512 --> 37:04.720
For some reason, you can't.

37:07.518 --> 37:09.179
lt no longer matters.

37:09.311 --> 37:11.973
Because you are going to
remove her powers.

37:12.064 --> 37:15.977
I may not be able to hurt Emma,
but I can hurt those around her.

37:16.068 --> 37:19.526
Her parents. Her friends. Her child.

37:19.655 --> 37:20.735
Do not go near them.

37:20.823 --> 37:25.237
Yes, you've become quite fond
of the boy, haven't you?

37:25.536 --> 37:29.120
lwill enjoy turning him
into a monkey's breakfast.

37:29.206 --> 37:30.241
I'll stop you.

37:30.332 --> 37:31.572
No, you won't.

37:31.667 --> 37:36.411
That pointy little hook of yours
can scratch a mere mortal. But me?

37:37.548 --> 37:40.164
You're out of your depth, pirate.

37:40.342 --> 37:42.458
The choice is yours.

37:42.553 --> 37:45.169
Kiss Emma and remove her powers

37:45.264 --> 37:48.506
or everyone she loves dies.

38:09.288 --> 38:11.654
Swan. I didn't expect to see you here.

38:11.748 --> 38:14.080
What do you mean? Where's Henry?
Is everything all right?

38:14.168 --> 38:16.750
He's fine. He's with his grandparents.
I thought they might be back here.

38:16.837 --> 38:18.327
We haven't seen them.

38:18.422 --> 38:21.129
If you're not with Henry,
what have you been doing all day?

38:22.217 --> 38:25.835
l was enlisted to help Ariel
find her lost prince.

38:25.929 --> 38:29.922
Really? That fish is in Storybrooke?

38:32.436 --> 38:33.721
She was. Yes.

38:34.229 --> 38:36.015
And we found a clue in Gold's shop

38:36.106 --> 38:39.143
which led us to discover that Eric had
been shipwrecked on Hangman's lsland

38:39.234 --> 38:41.145
just off the coast
of the enchanted forest.

38:41.236 --> 38:43.693
Zelena's curse
must not have reached that far.

38:43.780 --> 38:45.190
Ariel's on her way there now.

38:45.282 --> 38:48.866
She wanted me to say goodbye
to Mary Margaret for her.

38:48.952 --> 38:51.910
Well, at the rate mermaids swim,
she's probably already there.

38:54.458 --> 38:56.414
In fact, let's find out.

38:58.504 --> 39:01.621
I thought you couldn't use mirror magic
to look between worlds.

39:01.757 --> 39:02.837
I can't.

39:02.925 --> 39:04.790
But after seeing
the raw power you possess,

39:05.969 --> 39:07.630
I think maybe you can.

39:07.721 --> 39:09.006
(HOOK SIGHS)

39:09.097 --> 39:11.008
There's no need. I'm sure she's fine.

Anyway, it's bad form
to spy on such a private affair.

39:15.145 --> 39:16.225
How do I do it?

39:17.439 --> 39:18.474
Well, you've focused.

Now you have to look inward.

39:44.800 --> 39:48.884
You did this?
You brought them together?

39:49.846 --> 39:53.088
No, it was Ariel.
She never stopped believing.

REGINA: This is a terrible mistake.

40:24.590 --> 40:26.831
She's right.
Someone could've been seriously hurt.

40:26.925 --> 40:28.085
Only if you're a mailbox.

40:30.387 --> 40:31.467
It was so much fun!

40:31.555 --> 40:36.174
What can I say? I've got
a reckless, carefree, fun side.

40:37.936 --> 40:40.177
Killian? Where's our friend?

40:41.356 --> 40:46.146
It turns out, her missing husband
was back home, after all.

40:46.236 --> 40:47.271
It's true.

40:47.362 --> 40:49.853
We just checked in
on them on... Skype.

40:50.949 --> 40:54.112
She sends her regards,
but she was too excited to wait.

40:55.078 --> 40:56.454
A happy ending.

40:58.123 --> 41:01.707
Well, maybe our luck's about to change.
Dinner at Granny's?

41:03.170 --> 41:04.660
-Can I drive?
-ALL: No!

41:05.130 --> 41:06.995
Well, I guess I'll leave you guys to it.

41:07.883 --> 41:08.918
You're not coming?

41:11.803 --> 41:13.339
Another time, perhaps.

41:13.430 --> 41:16.217
Well, if you change your mind,
you know where we'll be.

41:17.392 --> 41:18.893
And, Killian?

41:20.312 --> 41:24.021
Whatever happened this past year,
whatever you're not telling me?

41:24.107 --> 41:25.722
I don't care.

41:25.859 --> 41:27.895
I'm tired of living in the past.

41:29.363 --> 41:30.944
I know how you feel.
