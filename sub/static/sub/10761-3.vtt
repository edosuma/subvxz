Oh, wrong file.
You're not supposed to look at that.

02:17.500 --> 02:20.500

which, by the way,
is clearly umber and not burnt sienna.

02:34.300 --> 02:37.400
I can tell you that it's very common
for patients to displace feelings

02:37.700 --> 02:41.000
they have for someone else onto their
psychiatrist. It's called transference.

02:41.700 --> 02:45.100
So even if a patient thinks she might
be in love with me, she really isn't.

02:45.400 --> 02:48.500
And usually those feelings disappear
as therapy progresses.

02:48.700 --> 02:50.900

- Okay.

it was the worst night of my life.

the last time I slept through a night.

Yes, of course, but this constant

- Really?

about transference?

04:39.300 --> 04:41.500
Well, more than most.

04:41.700 --> 04:44.600
Is it true that patients can actually
fall in love with their therapist?

04:44.900 --> 04:47.100
Oh, yes, yes.
As a matter of fact, it's quite common.

04:47.500 --> 04:50.100
You see, in a therapeutic setting,

04:50.500 --> 04:54.200
a doctor's empathy can be
misconstrued as romantic interest,

04:54.600 --> 04:58.300
especially when the patient
is of a particularly vulnerable nature.

04:58.600 --> 05:00.600
But therapists never return
those feelings, right?

05:00.900 --> 05:04.900
Well, they're not supposed to.
But it does happen. Ahh.

- This is her office. And you are?
- Her 2:00.

12:51.300 --> 12:55.200
- I don't have anything on the books.
- This is unbelievable. Make a note.

12:55.500 --> 12:58.500
Re-evaluate all scheduling procedures,
cc all department heads.

12:59.000 --> 13:00.900
Heather will be back in five,
if you want to wait.

13:01.200 --> 13:04.100
Oh, we'll wait. In the meantime,
two coffees. Cream and sugar.

13:04.400 --> 13:06.400
Think you can handle that?

13:08.000 --> 13:11.300
- Yes.
- We'll be in her office. Let's go.

13:15.900 --> 13:18.100
ROZ [SHOUTING]:
Now!

13:19.800 --> 13:23.000
You know, I think coffee
might make me more nervous.

13:23.400 --> 13:24.500
We're not gonna drink it.

13:24.700 --> 13:26.900
I'm just trying to buy some time
so we can look around.

13:27.200 --> 13:30.400
She's gotta be in one
of these pictures somewhere.

13:31.400 --> 13:34.300
There's a lot of people there.
Which one do you suppose she is?

13:34.600 --> 13:36.200
I think it's the one that looks like her.

13:38.200 --> 13:40.100
HEATHER:
Excuse me. Can I help you?

13:40.300 --> 13:42.200
We flew in from Corporate
for a meeting

13:42.500 --> 13:45.000
which the geniuses in your department
managed to screw up.

13:45.800 --> 13:49.200
I don't what kind of monkey business
is going on around here,

13:49.500 --> 13:54.000
but we are this close
to shutting this entire branch down.

13:54.700 --> 13:57.900
How could you fly in from Corporate?
Corporate's downstairs.

14:03.700 --> 14:06.200
I'm calling Security. Who are you?

14:06.400 --> 14:08.200
Who am I?

14:08.900 --> 14:09.900
Who am I?

14:10.100 --> 14:12.700
[SHOUTING]
Just run!

14:24.100 --> 14:26.200
It's asleep, Dad.

14:26.900 --> 14:28.800
No, it's not.

14:29.700 --> 14:33.100
Really? He hasn't twitched his tail
for two minutes.

14:33.600 --> 14:37.400
That's because he's lulling him
into a false sense of security.

14:37.800 --> 14:42.500
The most dangerous part of a gecko
is its mind.

14:48.600 --> 14:51.800
What are you talking about?

14:54.700 --> 14:57.600
A gecko's brain is like this big.

14:59.100 --> 15:03.000
But a cricket's brain is only this big.

15:06.900 --> 15:09.200
All right, fine, where were we?

15:09.400 --> 15:11.400
Ann-Margret.

15:11.600 --> 15:14.800
You cannot just blurt out
Ann-Margret like that. I'm sorry.

15:15.200 --> 15:20.500
We can only take 10 women
to Love Island, all right?

15:20.900 --> 15:22.400
Gotta put a little thought into this.

15:23.500 --> 15:25.100
Tell you who makes my list.

15:26.100 --> 15:30.900
That dark-haired temptress
that works at the bookstore.

15:32.300 --> 15:35.700
- Lisa.
- You know her name?

15:36.300 --> 15:37.800
Are you kidding?

15:38.100 --> 15:41.100
All this time you've been going there,
I thought you belonged to a book club.

15:41.400 --> 15:43.900
Oh, there's a club, all right.

15:46.600 --> 15:49.100
You know,
she got a belly ring last week.

15:50.600 --> 15:52.900
That's fantastic.

15:54.800 --> 15:58.200
Here. Hold onto this for a minute,
will you, while I grab a beer.

15:58.400 --> 16:00.800
Sure. Ooh, Dad, he's making
his move. I can feel him.

16:01.100 --> 16:03.800
- Oh. All right. Give him a little play.
- Right. I'm doing it.

16:04.000 --> 16:06.000
- All right, a little more. A little more.
- Right.

16:06.300 --> 16:07.300
[CRICKET CHIRPS]

16:07.600 --> 16:09.900
- He got him. Reel him in.
- Right. Right.

16:10.200 --> 16:13.200
Not too fast, now. Not too fast.
You don't want to tug at it.

16:13.500 --> 16:15.700
I can't believe this worked.
That was amazing.

16:16.000 --> 16:18.800
- Oh, great work, buddy.
- Oh, thanks, Dad.

16:19.200 --> 16:23.300
- I meant the gecko.
- Yes, yes, of course.

16:23.600 --> 16:27.200
- Good job. Well done.
- Will you be using this floss anymore?

16:31.000 --> 16:33.100
- I think we'll let him keep it, all right?
- Okay.

16:33.500 --> 16:36.100
There we go. In you go, little man.
Congratulations.

16:36.400 --> 16:38.700
[BOTH CHUCKLING]

16:39.000 --> 16:41.800
Well, that's it.

16:42.100 --> 16:44.600
Yep. Cricket's dead.

16:45.400 --> 16:51.100
Gosh, even though I am savouring
the newfound silence,

16:51.400 --> 16:53.700
I sort of miss
the excitement of the hunt.

16:54.100 --> 16:55.100
MARTIN:
Yeah.

16:56.200 --> 16:57.500
Well, all right.

16:58.200 --> 16:59.700
You know, Dad,

17:00.000 --> 17:04.200
were you aware
that the male cricket chirps

17:04.599 --> 17:06.900
in order to attract
the female cricket?

17:07.200 --> 17:10.500
Oh, that cricket
was doing an awful lot of chirping.

17:11.700 --> 17:14.500
- Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
- There might be another cricket.

17:14.700 --> 17:16.700
There might be more than one.

17:17.000 --> 17:19.000
I'd hate to go to bed
and have to get up again.

17:19.599 --> 17:22.000
Probably we should just play it safe.

17:22.300 --> 17:24.900
- Release the gecko.
- Yes.

17:28.300 --> 17:30.100
[KNOCKING ON DOOR]

17:30.700 --> 17:34.300
Well, this is an unexpected treat.

17:35.000 --> 17:38.200
Niles, I have something to tell you.

17:38.600 --> 17:40.500
Is it that I'm the sexiest man
you've ever known?

17:40.700 --> 17:43.200
No. I mean, yes, you are.

17:43.600 --> 17:45.800
Yes, but that's not why I'm here.

17:46.100 --> 17:48.700
- Something wrong?
- Well, sort of.

17:48.900 --> 17:50.600
It's about Heather Murphy.

17:52.100 --> 17:55.700
Daphne, I have told you,
I cannot talk about my patients.

17:56.100 --> 17:59.600
You don't have to.
I found out by myself.

18:02.000 --> 18:03.600
Did you look in my briefcase?

18:05.800 --> 18:09.400
- You read her file?
- I know, I know. It's bad.

18:13.600 --> 18:15.500
Those files are confidential.
How could you?

18:15.800 --> 18:17.900
Look, before you get going,
you should probably know...

18:18.200 --> 18:21.000
No, there's no excuse. That is
the worst thing you could have done.

18:21.300 --> 18:22.900
You would think so.

18:30.300 --> 18:32.400
What else did you do?

18:32.700 --> 18:35.000
I went down to her office
to see what she looks like.

18:35.300 --> 18:38.600
But... She never found out who I was
or why I was there.

18:39.100 --> 18:42.100
I know it doesn't make it okay,
but I was just so worried

18:42.400 --> 18:45.100
and I had to find
out who she was and...

18:45.500 --> 18:49.100
I'm so sorry. I feel so ashamed.

18:49.300 --> 18:52.200
It was all Roz's idea.

18:57.000 --> 19:00.700
Look, I know you're angry,
but please say something.

19:02.000 --> 19:04.200
- Angry doesn't begin to describe it.
- Niles...

19:04.500 --> 19:08.100
You have violated
this person's privacy.

19:08.400 --> 19:11.400
If she found out,
they could suspend my licence.

19:11.700 --> 19:13.400
I am so sorry.

19:13.700 --> 19:17.100
And you don't trust me.

19:19.200 --> 19:23.000
How could you possibly think
there could be somebody else?

19:23.700 --> 19:26.100
Because I was somebody else.

19:26.400 --> 19:28.000
What?

19:29.100 --> 19:30.800
You were married
to two other women

19:31.100 --> 19:33.200
while you claimed
to have been in love with me.

19:33.400 --> 19:36.500
Well, now that we're together,
how can I be sure,

19:36.800 --> 19:41.000
really sure, that there won't ever be
another somebody else?

19:41.400 --> 19:44.700
Because I would never... Ugh.

19:52.000 --> 19:55.300
Because this time it's different.

19:56.000 --> 19:58.200
Our love is different.

19:58.500 --> 20:02.300
It's not based
on somebody's expectations

20:03.300 --> 20:05.500
or anything I'm supposed to be.

20:05.800 --> 20:10.200
When I was with Maris or with Mel,
I found myself thinking about you.

20:11.400 --> 20:15.500
Going about my day,
or even when I was in a session,

20:15.900 --> 20:18.200
I found myself thinking about you.

20:18.900 --> 20:20.900
Well, now we're together.

20:22.500 --> 20:25.100
I find myself thinking about you.

20:26.600 --> 20:28.300
It's not going to stop.

20:35.400 --> 20:37.300
I'm still mad at you.

20:39.400 --> 20:41.100
I know.
