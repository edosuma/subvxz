WEBVTT

00:10.761 --> 00:13.059
Well, there we go, universal roaming.

00:15.140 --> 00:17.108
Never have to worry
about a signal again.

00:17.684 --> 00:20.153
No way. This is too mad.

00:20.229 --> 00:23.859
You're telling me I can phone anyone
anywhere in space and time on my mobile?

00:23.941 --> 00:28.788
As long as you know the area code.
Frequent ﬂyers' privilege.

00:29.988 --> 00:31.285
Go on, try it.

00:35.118 --> 00:39.043
Distress signal. Clocking off.
Might be a bit of...

00:41.875 --> 00:45.630
turbulence. Sorry.
Come on, Martha, let's take a look.

00:46.296 --> 00:48.515
Automated distress signal transmitted.

00:48.590 --> 00:49.933
Now, that is hot.

00:50.008 --> 00:52.386
Automated distress signal transmitted.

00:52.469 --> 00:54.563
It's like a sauna in here.

00:54.638 --> 00:59.269
Venting systems working at full pelt,
trying to cool down

01:00.477 --> 01:04.152
wherever it is we are.
Well, if you can't stand the heat...

01:07.818 --> 01:10.071
- That's better.
- Oi, you two!

01:10.153 --> 01:12.827
- Get out of there!
- Seal that door now!

01:14.366 --> 01:16.994
Who are you?
What are you doing on my ship?

01:17.578 --> 01:19.751
- Are you police?
- Why would we be police?

01:19.830 --> 01:21.082
We got your distress signal.

01:21.164 --> 01:22.882
If this is a ship,
why can't I hear any engines?

01:22.958 --> 01:24.301
It went dead four minutes ago.

01:24.376 --> 01:26.936
So maybe we should stop chatting
and get to Engineering, Captain.

01:28.005 --> 01:29.928
Secure closure active.

01:30.007 --> 01:31.930
- What?
- The ship's gone mad.

01:32.759 --> 01:37.515
Who activated secure closure?
I nearly got locked into area 27.

01:40.392 --> 01:44.442
- Who are you?
- He's the Doctor and I'm Martha. Hello.

01:44.521 --> 01:48.526
Impact projection,
42 minutes, 27 seconds.

01:48.609 --> 01:51.283
We'll get out of this, I promise.

01:51.361 --> 01:53.489
- Doctor.
- Forty two minutes until what?

01:53.572 --> 01:55.370
Doctor!

01:56.867 --> 01:58.540
Look!

01:59.661 --> 02:03.006
Forty two minutes
until we crash into the sun.

03:08.397 --> 03:10.616
- How many crew members on board?
- Seven, including us.

03:10.691 --> 03:12.693
We transfer cargo across the galaxy.
Everything's automated.

03:12.776 --> 03:14.699
- We just keep the ship...
- Call the others. I'll get you out!

03:14.778 --> 03:16.405
- What's he doing?
- Doctor, don't!

03:20.826 --> 03:23.750
- But my ship's in there!
- In the vent chamber?

03:25.831 --> 03:27.504
- It's our lifeboat.
- It's lava.

03:27.582 --> 03:31.632
Temperature's going mad in there.
Up 3,000 degrees in 10 seconds

03:31.712 --> 03:33.760
- and still rising.
- Channelling the air.

03:33.839 --> 03:36.388
The closer we get to the sun,
the hotter that room's gonna get.

03:36.466 --> 03:39.219
- We're stuck here.
- So we fix the engines.

03:39.302 --> 03:42.306
We steer the ship away from the sun.
Simple. Engineering down here, is it?

03:42.389 --> 03:45.438
- Yes.
- Impact in 40:26.

03:46.768 --> 03:49.521
Blimey. Do you always
leave things in such a mess?

03:49.604 --> 03:52.153
- Oh, my God.
- The hell happened?

03:54.109 --> 03:55.201
Oh, it's wrecked.

03:55.277 --> 03:58.372
Pretty efficiently, too.
Someone knew what they were doing.

03:58.447 --> 04:01.326
Where's Korwin?
Has anyone heard from him or Ashton?

04:01.450 --> 04:02.497
No.

04:02.617 --> 04:04.665
Do you mean
someone did this on purpose?

04:04.745 --> 04:06.622
Korwin, Ashton, where are you?

04:08.415 --> 04:10.918
Korwin, can you answer?

04:11.334 --> 04:13.553
Where the hell is he?
He should be up here.

04:13.670 --> 04:16.844
Oh, we're in the Toragy system. Lovely.

04:17.923 --> 04:20.928
You're a long way from home,
Martha, half a universe away.

04:21.011 --> 04:22.263
Yeah, feels it.

04:22.345 --> 04:27.693
And you're still using energy scoops for
fusion. Hasn't that been outlawed yet?

04:28.435 --> 04:32.611
We're due to upgrade next docking.
Scan all engine reports.

04:39.029 --> 04:41.373
- No response.
- What?

04:45.202 --> 04:47.079
They're burnt out.
The controls are wrecked.

04:47.204 --> 04:48.501
I can't get them back online.

04:48.580 --> 04:52.551
Oh, come on, auxiliary engines.
Every craft's got auxiliaries.

04:52.667 --> 04:54.135
We don't have access from here.

04:54.211 --> 04:56.305
The auxiliary controls
are in the front of the ship.

04:56.379 --> 04:59.303
There are 29 password-sealed doors
between us and them.

04:59.382 --> 05:02.135
- You'll never get there on time.
- Can't you override the doors?

05:02.219 --> 05:06.065
No, sealed closure means what it says.
They're all deadlock sealed.

05:06.556 --> 05:08.058
So a sonic screwdriver's no use.

05:08.183 --> 05:10.936
Nothing's any use. We've got no engines,
no time and no chance.

05:11.019 --> 05:14.364
Oh, listen to you!
Defeated before you even started.

05:14.439 --> 05:17.443
Where's your Dunkirk spirit?
Who's got the door passwords?

05:17.526 --> 05:19.767
They're randomly generated.
Reckon I'd know most of them.

05:19.820 --> 05:21.288
Sorry. Riley Vashtee.

05:21.404 --> 05:23.202
Then what are you waiting for,
Riley Vashtee? Get on it.

05:23.281 --> 05:24.954
Well, it's a two-person job.

05:25.033 --> 05:27.035
One to take this for the questions.

05:27.118 --> 05:29.120
The other to carry this.

05:29.204 --> 05:32.128
The oldest and cheapest security system
around, eh, Captain?

05:32.207 --> 05:34.301
Reliable and simple.
Just like you, eh, Riley?

05:34.417 --> 05:38.718
- Try to be helpful, get abuse. Nice.
- I'll help you. Make myself useful.

05:38.797 --> 05:40.515
It's remotely controlled
by the computer panel.

05:40.590 --> 05:44.515
- That's why it needs two.
- Oi, be careful.

05:45.470 --> 05:47.393
You, too.

05:47.472 --> 05:49.941
McDonnell, it's Ashton.

05:50.225 --> 05:53.900
- Where are you? Is Korwin with you?
- Get up to the med centre now.

06:03.780 --> 06:06.659
Impact in 34:37.

06:07.784 --> 06:10.788
- I've got to stop it!
- Korwin, it's Abi.

06:11.746 --> 06:13.999
Open your eyes.
I need to take a look at you.

06:14.124 --> 06:15.922
Korwin! What's happened? Is he okay?

06:16.001 --> 06:18.971
Help! Help me! It's burning me!

06:19.588 --> 06:22.762
- How long's he been like this?
- Ashton just brought him in.

06:22.841 --> 06:24.843
- What are you doing to him?
- Don't get too close.

06:24.968 --> 06:28.973
- Don't be stupid. He's my husband.
- And he's just sabotaged our ship.

06:29.306 --> 06:31.400
- What?
- He went mad.

06:31.474 --> 06:33.272
He put the ship under secure closure.

06:33.351 --> 06:35.228
Then he sent a heat pulse
to melt the control.

06:35.312 --> 06:37.986
- No way! He wouldn't do that.
- I saw it happen, Captain.

06:38.064 --> 06:40.237
Korwin?
Korwin, open your eyes for me a second.

06:40.317 --> 06:42.536
- I can't.
- Yeah, of course you can. Go on.

06:42.652 --> 06:44.746
Don't make me look at you. Please.

06:45.280 --> 06:48.500
All right, all right,
all right, just relax. Sedative.

06:52.913 --> 06:54.540
What's wrong with him?

06:54.623 --> 06:57.502
Rising body temperature,
unusual energy readings.

06:58.293 --> 07:00.716
Stasis chamber.
I do love a good stasis chamber.

07:00.837 --> 07:03.511
Keep him sedated in there.
Regulate the body temperature.

07:03.590 --> 07:07.470
And just for fun, run a bio-scan,
a tissue profile and a metabolic detail.

07:07.552 --> 07:09.099
Just doing them now.

07:09.179 --> 07:11.978
Oh, you're good.
Anyone else presenting these symptoms?

07:12.057 --> 07:14.901
- Not so far.
- Well, that's something.

07:14.976 --> 07:16.649
Will someone tell me
what is the matter with him?

07:16.728 --> 07:19.072
Some sort of infection.
We'll know more after the test results.

07:19.147 --> 07:24.028
Now, allons-y! Back downstairs, eh?
See about those engines. Go.

07:24.110 --> 07:26.613
Hey! Go.

07:30.408 --> 07:32.410
Call us if there's news. Any questions?

07:32.535 --> 07:36.711
- Yeah. Who are you?
- I'm the Doctor.

07:45.215 --> 07:49.061
Heat shield failing al' 25%.

07:49.552 --> 07:52.305
Impact in 32:50.

07:54.224 --> 07:58.320
- Hurry up, will you?
- All right. Fix the clamp on.

08:00.063 --> 08:02.111
What are you typing?

08:02.190 --> 08:05.911
These doors' trip code is the answer
to a random question set by the crew.

08:05.986 --> 08:08.830
Nine tours back,
we got drunk, thought them up.

08:08.905 --> 08:12.626
Reckoning was, if we're hijacked, we're
the only ones who know all the answers.

08:12.701 --> 08:16.956
- So you type in the right answer...
- This sends a remote pulse to the clamp.

08:17.288 --> 08:22.044
But we only get one chance per door.
Get it wrong, the whole system freezes.

08:22.127 --> 08:24.425
- Better not get it wrong, then.
- Okay.

08:24.671 --> 08:28.926
"Date of SS Pentalliani's first flight?"
That's all right. Go!

08:31.136 --> 08:33.934
- Yes!
- Twenty eight more to go!

08:36.265 --> 08:38.894
Abi, how's Korwin doing?
Any results from the bio-scan?

08:38.977 --> 08:40.775
He's under heavy sedation.

08:41.020 --> 08:43.615
I'm just trying
to make sense of this data.

08:43.857 --> 08:46.827
Give me a couple of minutes
and I'll let you know.

09:01.124 --> 09:04.298
- Martha, Riley, how are you doing?
- Area 29, at the door to 28.

09:04.461 --> 09:07.431
- Yeah, you've got to move faster.
- We're doing our best.

09:08.298 --> 09:12.269
"Find the next number in the sequence:
313, 331, 367."

09:12.343 --> 09:14.562
- What?
- You said the crew knew all the answers.

09:14.637 --> 09:16.560
The crew's changed
since we set the questions.

09:16.639 --> 09:18.687
- You're joking.
- 379.

09:18.767 --> 09:21.862
- What?
- It's a sequence of happy primes. 379.

09:21.978 --> 09:23.980
- Happy what?
- Just enter it.

09:24.105 --> 09:25.857
Are you sure? We only get one chance.

09:25.940 --> 09:28.238
Any number that reduces to one
when you take the sum of the square

09:28.318 --> 09:31.071
of its digits and continue iterating
until it yields one is a happy number.

09:31.154 --> 09:33.077
Any number that doesn't, isn't.
A happy prime is a number

09:33.156 --> 09:35.409
that's both happy and prime.
Now type it in!

09:35.492 --> 09:37.540
I don't know. Talk about dumbing down.

09:37.619 --> 09:39.747
Don't they teach
recreational mathematics any more?

09:43.708 --> 09:46.302
- We're through!
- Keep moving fast as you can.

09:47.295 --> 09:50.469
And, Martha, be careful. There may be
something else on board the ship.

09:50.548 --> 09:52.767
Any time you want to unnerve me,
feel free.

09:52.842 --> 09:54.094
Will do, thanks.

09:54.177 --> 09:56.726
Impact in 30:50.

09:57.514 --> 10:00.267
I can't believe our lives depend
on some stupid pub quiz.

10:00.350 --> 10:03.980
- Is that the next one?
- Oh, this is a nightmare.

10:04.229 --> 10:06.903
"Classical music, who had the most
pre-download number ones,"

10:06.981 --> 10:09.780
"Elvis Presley or The Bee-atlas?"

10:10.693 --> 10:12.695
How are we supposed to know that?

10:12.862 --> 10:15.285
We need a backup in case they don't
reach the auxiliary engine in time.

10:15.365 --> 10:17.117
Come on, think.
Resources. What have we got?

10:17.200 --> 10:18.873
- Doctor?
- What is it now?

10:18.952 --> 10:21.455
Who had the most number ones,
Elvis or The Beatles?

10:21.538 --> 10:23.586
- That's pre-download.
- Elvis.

10:23.706 --> 10:27.756
No, The Beatles! No, wait...

10:28.044 --> 10:30.638
Oh, what was that remix?

10:30.713 --> 10:33.808
- I don't know. I am a bit busy.
- Fine. I'll ask someone else.

10:33.883 --> 10:37.183
Now, where was I?
Here Comes the Sun. No, resources.

10:37.262 --> 10:39.060
So, the power's still working.

10:39.139 --> 10:41.892
The generator's going.
If we can harness that... Ah!

10:41.975 --> 10:43.727
Use the generator to jumpstart the ship.

10:43.852 --> 10:46.901
Exactly. At the very least,
it will buy some more time.

10:47.355 --> 10:50.234
- That is brilliant.
- I know. See?

10:50.859 --> 10:53.328
- Tiny glimmer of hope.
- If it works.

10:53.403 --> 10:55.952
Oh, believe me,
you're gonna make it work.

10:59.409 --> 11:00.535
That told him.

11:00.910 --> 11:02.958
Impact in 29:46.

11:08.001 --> 11:11.380
- Hello?
- Mum, it's me. It's Martha. Wow!

11:11.462 --> 11:15.092
Where are you? Don't you check
your messages? I've been calling you.

11:15.175 --> 11:17.143
Actually, a bit busy.
I need you to do something for me.

11:17.260 --> 11:21.310
No, listen to me.
We have to talk about the Doctor.

11:21.431 --> 11:23.809
Mum, please, not now! I need you
to look something up on the Internet.

11:23.933 --> 11:27.733
- Do it yourself. You've got a computer.
- Oh, just do it, will you?

11:34.068 --> 11:36.992
- Please.
- When did you get so rude?

11:37.071 --> 11:40.701
I'll tell you when.
Ever since you met that man.

11:40.950 --> 11:44.045
I need to know who has more
number ones, The Beatles or Elvis.

11:44.120 --> 11:45.872
Hang on. The mouse is unplugged.

11:49.459 --> 11:54.215
- Okay, hang on. What is this, pub quiz?
- Yeah, pub quiz.

11:54.297 --> 11:57.676
- Using your mobile is cheating.
- Have you found it?

11:57.800 --> 12:01.225
There's over 400, 000 results.
Give me a minute.

12:02.472 --> 12:04.520
Impact in 28:50.

12:06.142 --> 12:08.395
Doctor, these readings
are starting to scare me.

12:08.478 --> 12:11.402
- What do you mean?
- Look, Korwin's body is changing.

12:11.481 --> 12:14.451
His whole biological make-up...
It's impossible.

12:22.408 --> 12:27.835
This is med centre. Urgent assistance
requested. Urgent assistance!

12:28.873 --> 12:30.921
Stay here! Keep working!

12:35.380 --> 12:36.802
Urgent assistance!

12:37.298 --> 12:39.266
Abi, they're on their way.

12:43.346 --> 12:45.019
What's happening to you?

12:45.181 --> 12:47.650
Burn with me.

12:47.725 --> 12:49.648
Burn with me.

12:50.478 --> 12:53.402
Captain?
I told you to stay in Engineering.

12:53.481 --> 12:55.734
I only take orders
from one person round here.

12:55.858 --> 12:57.451
Oh, is he always this cheery?

12:57.652 --> 12:59.199
- Elvis.
- What?

13:00.071 --> 13:01.448
Really? Elvis!

13:02.156 --> 13:04.124
Burn with me.

13:04.951 --> 13:06.578
Korwin, you're sick.

13:08.079 --> 13:11.003
Burn with me!

13:15.837 --> 13:18.841
- Mum, you're a star.
- Now, we need to have a serious...

13:27.682 --> 13:31.027
- What was that?
- I've got to go.

13:42.697 --> 13:43.977
Doctor, what were those screams?

13:43.990 --> 13:47.369
Concentrate on those doors.
You gotta keep moving forward!

13:49.037 --> 13:51.756
Impact in 27:06.

13:56.085 --> 13:57.803
Korwin's gone.

14:00.590 --> 14:01.842
Oh, my God.

14:08.264 --> 14:10.392
Tell me that's not Lerner.

14:13.269 --> 14:14.942
Endothermic vaporisation.

14:17.523 --> 14:19.867
I've never seen one this ferocious.

14:21.486 --> 14:22.908
"Burn with me."

14:22.987 --> 14:26.082
- That's what we heard Korwin say.
- What?

14:26.574 --> 14:29.202
Do you think... No way.

14:29.619 --> 14:32.293
Scannell, tell him.
Korwin is not a killer.

14:32.455 --> 14:36.301
- He can't vaporise people. He's human.
- These bio-scan results.

14:36.751 --> 14:38.879
Internal temperature, 100 degrees.

14:40.004 --> 14:42.848
Body oxygen replaced by hydrogen.
Your husband hasn't been infected.

14:42.924 --> 14:45.643
- He's been overwhelmed.
- The test results are wrong.

14:45.760 --> 14:48.730
What is it, though?
A parasite? A mutagenic virus?

14:48.805 --> 14:50.978
Something that needs a host body,
but how did it get inside him?

14:51.057 --> 14:53.355
Stop talking
like he's some kind of experiment.

14:53.434 --> 14:56.779
Where's this ship been?
Have you made planetfall recently?

14:56.854 --> 15:00.233
Docked with any other vessels?
Any sort of external contact at all?

15:00.316 --> 15:01.784
What is this, an interrogation?

15:01.859 --> 15:04.157
We've got to stop him
before he kills again.

15:04.237 --> 15:06.786
We're just a cargo ship.

15:09.242 --> 15:11.586
Doctor, if you give her a minute...

15:14.455 --> 15:16.674
I'm fine. I need to warn the crew.

15:18.751 --> 15:22.847
Everybody listen to me.
Something has infected Korwin.

15:24.173 --> 15:25.595
We think

15:28.594 --> 15:30.517
he killed Abi Lerner.

15:33.182 --> 15:36.402
None of you must go anywhere near him.
Is that clear?

15:38.062 --> 15:39.609
Understood Captain.

15:39.689 --> 15:42.408
Erina, get back here
with that equipment.

15:44.068 --> 15:46.196
Whatever you say, boss.

15:47.029 --> 15:53.503
"Go there. Come back. Fetch this.
Carry these. Make drinks. Sweep up."

15:54.162 --> 15:56.415
Please, kill me now.

15:58.583 --> 16:00.836
Burn with me.

16:03.379 --> 16:05.552
Burn with me.

16:12.555 --> 16:14.899
Impact in 24:57.

16:16.017 --> 16:18.736
Is the infection permanent?
Can you cure him?

16:21.397 --> 16:24.571
- I don't know.
- Don't lie to me, Doctor.

16:25.735 --> 16:30.457
Eleven years we've been married.
We chose this ship together.

16:31.407 --> 16:36.083
He keeps me honest.
So I don't want false hope.

16:37.538 --> 16:40.587
The parasite's too aggressive.
Your husband's gone.

16:41.751 --> 16:43.719
There's no way back. Sorry.

16:47.590 --> 16:48.842
Thank you.

16:51.052 --> 16:53.931
Are you certain
nothing happened to provoke this?

16:54.305 --> 16:58.230
Nobody's working on anything secret?
'Cause it's vital that you tell me.

16:58.309 --> 17:00.858
I know every inch of this ship.

17:01.270 --> 17:05.616
I know every detail of my crew's lives.
There is nothing.

17:07.318 --> 17:10.117
Then why is this thing
so interested in you?

17:13.406 --> 17:15.159
I wish I knew.

17:24.752 --> 17:26.753
Doctor, we've moved to area 77.

17:26.837 --> 17:30.637
Keep going. You've got to get
to area 7 and reboot those engines.

17:38.849 --> 17:40.851
You got those tools, Erina?
'Cause I'm...

17:47.233 --> 17:50.783
Korwin, it's me. We're mates.

17:50.861 --> 17:56.163
They are getting too far.
We must share the light.

18:10.840 --> 18:14.140
Heat shields failing at 20%.

18:14.677 --> 18:16.350
Come on!

18:17.763 --> 18:19.436
Everything on this ship is so cheap.

18:20.725 --> 18:22.193
Who's there?

18:30.234 --> 18:33.113
- Is that Korwin?
- No, wait a minute.

18:35.531 --> 18:37.283
Oh, Ashton, what are you doing?

18:37.366 --> 18:39.209
Burn with me.

18:40.328 --> 18:43.047
- Well, if you want to help...
- Burn with me.

18:44.081 --> 18:46.209
Burn with me.

18:47.209 --> 18:49.632
No! Come on!

19:10.733 --> 19:14.078
- What is happening on this ship?
- Never mind that. Where are we?

19:14.195 --> 19:17.995
Airlock field. Jettison escape pod.

19:18.074 --> 19:20.793
Does it mean us? Doctor!

19:20.910 --> 19:23.038
Pod jettison initiated.

19:24.372 --> 19:27.842
Doctor, we're stuck in an escape pod
of the area-17 airlock.

19:27.917 --> 19:31.467
One of the crew's trying to jettison us.
You've got to help us!

19:32.463 --> 19:34.340
Tell me you can stop it.

19:35.675 --> 19:37.769
- Why is this happening?
- Stay here.

19:37.927 --> 19:41.648
I mean it this time.
Don't start those engines!

19:49.939 --> 19:54.945
He's picking us off one by one.

19:57.113 --> 19:58.990
Jettison held.

20:00.116 --> 20:01.288
Thank you.

20:05.246 --> 20:07.715
Jettison reactivated.

20:10.793 --> 20:12.136
Come on.

20:20.886 --> 20:23.435
Sierpinski sequence. This'll get him.

20:26.392 --> 20:30.272
Jettison held. Escape pod stabilised.

20:32.314 --> 20:33.907
You're pretty good.

20:41.323 --> 20:42.996
Ashton!

20:48.581 --> 20:50.754
Someone's hacked at the systems.

20:52.293 --> 20:54.170
I can't re-root the generators.

20:54.253 --> 20:56.631
There's no way
I'm gonna be able to jumpstart the ship.

20:59.341 --> 21:01.469
Who the hell did that?

21:04.013 --> 21:05.686
Korwin?

21:07.933 --> 21:12.359
What are you?
Why are you killing my crew?

21:14.023 --> 21:18.494
What did you do to him?
What have you done to my husband?

21:20.237 --> 21:25.038
You recognise me. Korwin, you know me.

21:26.368 --> 21:29.542
It's Kath, your wife.

21:30.790 --> 21:32.758
- My wife?
- That's right.

21:34.376 --> 21:37.721
You're still in there. I'm your wife.

21:41.342 --> 21:43.344
It's your fault.

21:56.774 --> 21:58.071
That's enough!

22:01.570 --> 22:05.165
What do you want?
Why this ship? Tell me.

22:06.992 --> 22:08.335
Jettison activated.

22:08.410 --> 22:11.914
He's crushed the circuit.
I can't stop it. I can't stop it!

22:13.749 --> 22:15.592
What do you mean, it's my fault?

22:15.668 --> 22:20.265
It's your fault. Now burn with me.

22:23.717 --> 22:26.140
- What are you doing?
- Freezing him. Ice vents.

22:27.388 --> 22:28.731
You'll kill him!

22:28.931 --> 22:33.061
Come on, let's see you.

22:36.897 --> 22:39.241
I want to know what you really are.

22:49.702 --> 22:51.670
Airlock sealed.

22:59.211 --> 23:01.805
McDonnell, Ashton's heading
in your direction.

23:01.881 --> 23:03.758
He's been infected, just like Korwin.

23:08.012 --> 23:09.355
Korwin's dead, Doctor.

23:10.431 --> 23:11.978
Everything's locked.

23:12.558 --> 23:15.437
Airlock decompression compieted.

23:16.979 --> 23:18.526
Jettisoning pod.

23:23.402 --> 23:27.077
- Doctor!
- I'll save you.

23:28.824 --> 23:30.952
Martha, it's too late.

23:31.035 --> 23:33.959
- Doctor!
- I'll save you.

23:34.538 --> 23:36.586
I can't hear you.

24:04.318 --> 24:05.945
Sorry.

24:17.915 --> 24:20.384
Impact in 77:05.

24:28.217 --> 24:30.219
What did he mean, your fault?

24:33.514 --> 24:36.063
What are you doing?
Don't touch him. He's infected.

24:36.141 --> 24:39.315
- We don't know how it spreads.
- You murdered him.

24:39.395 --> 24:41.739
- He was about to kill you.
- He recognised me.

24:41.814 --> 24:44.988
You heard the Doctor.
It isn't Korwin any more.

24:45.067 --> 24:47.490
The Doctor doesn't know.
None of us know.

24:47.569 --> 24:49.569
So what are you gonna do?
Stay there until we burn?

24:49.571 --> 24:53.576
'Cause without you, none of us
stand a chance of getting out of here.

24:53.909 --> 24:56.753
Scannell,
I need a spacesuit in area 77 now!

24:56.829 --> 24:59.082
- What for?
- Just get down here!

25:01.750 --> 25:03.752
Well, go on. Do what he says.

25:03.961 --> 25:07.431
- Ashton's still out there.
- I'll deal with him.

25:22.021 --> 25:24.274
The wonderful world of space travel.

25:25.482 --> 25:28.861
The prettier it looks,
the more likely it is to kill you.

25:29.069 --> 25:32.198
- He'll come for us.
- No, it's too late.

25:32.865 --> 25:36.415
Our heat shields will pack in any minute
and then we go into free fall.

25:36.952 --> 25:40.673
We'll fall into the sun way before
he has a chance to do anything.

25:40.956 --> 25:45.177
You don't know the Doctor.
I believe in him.

25:46.003 --> 25:50.554
Then you're lucky. I've never found
anyone worth believing in.

25:53.469 --> 25:56.848
No girlfriend? Boyfriend?

25:57.806 --> 26:00.935
The job doesn't lend itself
to stable relationships.

26:01.727 --> 26:05.357
- Family, then?
- My dad's dead.

26:06.982 --> 26:09.781
I haven't seen my mum in six years.

26:11.278 --> 26:13.997
She didn't want me
to sign on for cargo tours.

26:14.782 --> 26:19.788
Things were said,
and since then, all silent.

26:21.789 --> 26:25.839
She wanted to hold on to me.
I know that. God, she's so stubborn.

26:26.919 --> 26:28.842
Yeah, well, that's families.

26:30.964 --> 26:33.092
What about you?

26:33.801 --> 26:38.682
Full works. Mum, dad, dad's girlfriend,

26:39.556 --> 26:43.936
brother, sister.
There's no silence there.

26:45.646 --> 26:47.569
So much noise.

26:50.192 --> 26:53.321
God, they'll never know.

26:54.238 --> 26:58.869
I’ll just have disappeared,
and they'll always be waiting.

27:00.702 --> 27:02.545
Call them.

27:06.708 --> 27:08.836
Ashton!

27:50.836 --> 27:53.259
- I can't let you do this.
- You're wasting your breath, Scannell.

27:53.422 --> 27:55.516
- You're not gonna stop me.
- You want to open an airlock inﬂight

27:55.591 --> 27:57.832
on a ship spinning into the sun.
No one can survive that.

27:57.885 --> 28:00.308
- Oh, just you watch.
- You open that airlock, it's suicide.

28:00.387 --> 28:02.185
This close to the sun,
the shields will barely protect you.

28:02.264 --> 28:04.107
If I can boost the magnetic lock
on the ship's exterior,

28:04.183 --> 28:06.561
it should re-magnetise the pod.
Now, while I'm out there, you've got

28:06.643 --> 28:09.364
to get the rest of those doors open.
We need those auxiliary engines.

28:09.438 --> 28:12.658
Doctor, will you listen.
They're too far away. It's too late.

28:12.733 --> 28:14.451
I'm not gonna lose her.

28:30.292 --> 28:32.636
Decompression initiated.

28:38.634 --> 28:41.103
Impact in 12:55.

28:44.389 --> 28:48.189
- Hello?
- It's me again. Sorry about earlier.

28:48.268 --> 28:51.818
- Is everything all rigth?
- Yeah. Of course.

28:53.440 --> 28:56.910
- Martha?
- Mum...

28:59.154 --> 29:02.954
- You know I love you, don't you?
- Of course, I do.

29:04.034 --> 29:06.503
- What's brought this on?
- I never say it.

29:07.663 --> 29:10.883
I never get the time
or never think of it, and then...

29:13.585 --> 29:15.053
I really love you.

29:16.964 --> 29:19.683
Tell Dad Leo and fish
that I love them, too.

29:21.301 --> 29:24.521
- Martha, what's wrong?
- Nothing, promise.

29:24.972 --> 29:27.225
- Where a re you?
Just out.

29:27.599 --> 29:30.728
- With anyone nice?
- Some mates.

29:30.811 --> 29:34.532
- What mates?
- Mum, can we not just talk?

29:35.691 --> 29:38.740
Of course.
What do you want to talk about?

29:39.111 --> 29:41.330
I don't know. Anything.

29:41.405 --> 29:44.875
What you had for breakfast,
what you watched on telly last night,

29:45.033 --> 29:48.412
how much you're gonna kill Dad
next time you see him, just anything.

29:50.163 --> 29:53.508
Is the Doctor with you? Is he there now?

29:53.792 --> 29:57.387
- Mum, just leave it.
- It's a simple enough question.

29:59.965 --> 30:01.217
I better go.

30:03.885 --> 30:06.809
- No, Martha, wait.
- See ya, Mum.

30:22.571 --> 30:24.665
Impact in 17:75.

30:24.740 --> 30:24.990
Heat shields

30:24.991 --> 30:26.367
Heat shields

30:26.742 --> 30:28.665
failing at 10%.

31:04.196 --> 31:05.994
Come on!

31:11.536 --> 31:13.288
Go on, my son.

31:19.127 --> 31:21.129
Doctor, how are you doing?

31:21.213 --> 31:24.717
I can't... I can't reach.

31:25.467 --> 31:27.640
I don't know how much longer I can last.

31:27.761 --> 31:29.729
Come on, don't give up now.

32:00.168 --> 32:04.924
- We're being pulled back!
- I told you! The Doctor!

32:28.238 --> 32:30.036
It's alive.

32:32.993 --> 32:34.836
It's alive.

32:36.455 --> 32:38.128
It's alive.

32:38.665 --> 32:42.386
Doctor, close the airlock now!
That pod's gonna smash into him.

32:43.670 --> 32:45.047
Stay here.

32:46.298 --> 32:48.892
Impact in 8:57.

32:51.011 --> 32:53.685
Airlock recompression completed

32:59.019 --> 33:03.115
Doctor! Doctor! Are you okay?

33:04.316 --> 33:06.569
Stay away from me.

33:08.111 --> 33:09.488
What's happened?

33:10.030 --> 33:12.249
It's your fault, Captain McDonnell.

33:13.241 --> 33:16.495
Riley, get down to area 10
and help Scannell with the doors.

33:16.578 --> 33:17.750
Go!

33:17.954 --> 33:21.379
You mined that sun,
stripped its surface for cheap fuel.

33:23.043 --> 33:25.284
- You should have scanned for life!
- I don't understand.

33:25.337 --> 33:27.510
Doctor, what are you talking about?

33:27.589 --> 33:30.263
That's sun's alive, a living organism.

33:31.259 --> 33:35.139
They scooped out its heart, used it
for fuel and now it's screaming!

33:35.222 --> 33:37.941
What do you mean? How can
a sun be alive? Why is he saying that?

33:38.183 --> 33:40.026
Because it's living in me.

33:40.602 --> 33:42.320
- Oh, my God.
- Humans!

33:42.437 --> 33:45.156
You grab whatever's nearest
and bleed it dry!

33:46.149 --> 33:47.571
You should've scanned!

33:47.651 --> 33:51.656
- It takes too long. We'd be caught.
- Fusion scoops are illegal.

33:52.072 --> 33:53.790
Martha, you've got
to freeze me, quickly.

33:53.865 --> 33:56.209
- What?
- Stasis chamber.

33:57.285 --> 34:02.291
Look, you've got to take me
to below -200. Freeze it out of me.

34:05.460 --> 34:07.383
It'll use me to kill you if you don't.

34:07.504 --> 34:10.632
The closer we get to the sun,
the stronger it is...

34:11.299 --> 34:14.724
- Med centre. Quickly! Quickly!
- Help me!

34:17.681 --> 34:19.934
Impact in 7:30.

34:41.621 --> 34:43.418
- What's your favourite colour?
- You what?

34:43.498 --> 34:45.170
- It's the question.
- Purple.

34:48.335 --> 34:49.838
- Or did I say orange?
- Come on!

34:58.597 --> 35:01.271
- Martha, where are you?
- It's all right. I'm here.

35:01.349 --> 35:04.273
Just setting everything up.
Stasis chamber, minus 200, yeah?

35:04.394 --> 35:06.817
But you don't know how
this equipment works. You'll kill him.

35:06.896 --> 35:08.489
Nobody can survive those temperatures.

35:08.565 --> 35:10.533
He's not human.
If he says he can survive, then he can.

35:10.650 --> 35:13.529
- Let me help you, then.
- You've done enough damage.

35:15.363 --> 35:18.082
Ten seconds.
That's all I'll be able to take.

35:19.242 --> 35:20.710
- Martha!
- Yeah?

35:21.828 --> 35:24.297
It's burning me up. I can't control it.

35:24.539 --> 35:28.885
If you don't get rid of it,
I could kill you. I could kill you all.

35:30.712 --> 35:34.637
- I'm scared. I'm so scared.
- Just stay calm.

35:35.008 --> 35:39.514
You saved me. Now I return the favour.
Just believe in me.

35:39.596 --> 35:41.724
It's burning. Kill me.
Then it won't happen.

35:42.891 --> 35:44.985
That's enough. I've got you.

35:45.101 --> 35:49.982
There's this process... this thing
that happens if I'm about to die...

35:50.065 --> 35:53.490
Shh! Quiet now,
'cause that is not going to happen.

35:53.568 --> 35:55.946
- You ready?
- No.

36:17.884 --> 36:21.229
Heat shields failing at 5%.

36:50.125 --> 36:53.129
No! Martha, you can't stop it! Not yet!

36:53.420 --> 36:56.264
- What happened?
- The power's been cut in Engineering.

36:57.215 --> 37:00.765
- But who's down there?
- Leave it to me.

37:07.600 --> 37:09.648
Impact in 4:47.

37:17.235 --> 37:19.033
Are we gonna do it in time?

37:25.326 --> 37:27.454
Come on, you're defrosting.

37:27.996 --> 37:31.091
Martha, listen, I could go
at any moment. You've got to go.

37:31.166 --> 37:34.716
- No way.
- Get to the front. Vent the engines.

37:35.754 --> 37:37.597
Sun particles in the fuel.
Get rid of them.

37:37.672 --> 37:40.016
- I am not leaving you.
- You've got to!

37:41.259 --> 37:43.136
Give back what they took.

37:43.219 --> 37:45.688
- Doctor.
- Please, go!

37:46.389 --> 37:48.016
I'll be back for you.

37:48.183 --> 37:50.231
Impact in 4:08.

37:58.860 --> 38:03.491
You were right. It was my fault.

38:13.708 --> 38:16.461
Impact in 3:43.

38:57.919 --> 39:01.765
I didn't know. I really didn't know.

39:02.215 --> 39:03.967
Korwin, please stop.

39:06.052 --> 39:09.101
Everyone must burn.

39:12.642 --> 39:16.112
Riley, Scannell, I'm sorry.

39:16.354 --> 39:18.322
McDonnell! McDonnell!

39:21.109 --> 39:22.952
I love you.

39:34.289 --> 39:36.667
Exterior airlock opened.

39:37.417 --> 39:39.795
It's the last door.
We've got to keep going.

39:44.340 --> 39:46.809
Impact in 2:77.

39:51.472 --> 39:56.603
Primary engine critical.
Repeat', primary engine critical.

40:10.742 --> 40:14.121
Survival estimate projection, 0%.

40:20.668 --> 40:21.760
Martha!

40:23.004 --> 40:27.054
Doctor! What are you doing?

40:28.843 --> 40:30.060
I can't fight it.

40:31.846 --> 40:33.189
Keep back, Martha!

40:37.393 --> 40:38.519
Burn with me.

40:38.937 --> 40:41.440
Burn with me, Martha.

40:41.981 --> 40:44.200
Impact in 7:27.

40:48.571 --> 40:49.868
Got it!

40:50.531 --> 40:53.125
Life support systems reaching critical.

40:53.201 --> 40:56.501
Repeat, life support systems
reaching critical.

40:57.622 --> 40:59.841
Impact in 7:06.

41:01.084 --> 41:03.587
Collision alert. Collision alert.

41:03.670 --> 41:05.889
It's not working. Why is it not working?

41:05.964 --> 41:09.468
Collision alert.
Fifty eight seconds to fatal impact.

41:09.550 --> 41:13.054
- Vent the engines. Dump the fuel.
- What?

41:13.137 --> 41:18.268
Sun particles in the fuel.
Get rid of them. Do it. Now!

41:24.273 --> 41:26.071
Come on, Doctor, hold on.

41:28.653 --> 41:33.079
Fuel dump in progress.
Fuel dump in progress.

41:55.263 --> 41:58.107
Ah, the engines are firing!

42:09.777 --> 42:15.284
Impact averted.
Impact averted. Impact averted.

42:20.621 --> 42:22.464
We're clear.

42:24.709 --> 42:26.757
We've got just enough reserves.

42:31.466 --> 42:33.343
Doctor!

42:56.324 --> 42:59.294
- This is never your ship.
- Compact, eh?

42:59.827 --> 43:04.924
And another good word, robust.
Barely a scorch mark on her.

43:05.166 --> 43:07.089
We can't just leave you
drifting with no fuel.

43:07.251 --> 43:09.049
We've sent out an official mayday.

43:09.170 --> 43:10.922
The authorities
will pick us up soon enough.

43:11.005 --> 43:14.179
- Though how we explain what happened...
- Just tell them.

43:14.258 --> 43:17.637
That sun needs care and protection,
just like any other living thing.

43:19.847 --> 43:23.943
So you're off, then.

43:25.478 --> 43:29.904
- No chance I'll see you again?
- Not really.

43:30.942 --> 43:34.537
It was nice, not dying with you.

43:37.740 --> 43:40.619
I reckon you'll find
someone worth believing in.

43:41.369 --> 43:43.371
I think I already did.

43:58.344 --> 44:02.065
Well done. Very hot.

44:05.101 --> 44:08.401
So, didn't really need you
in the end, did we?

44:11.357 --> 44:12.700
Sorry.

44:14.569 --> 44:16.071
How are you doing?

44:17.405 --> 44:18.998
Now, what do you say?

44:19.073 --> 44:21.997
Ice-skating on the mineral lakes
of Kur-ha. Fancy it?

44:22.118 --> 44:23.870
Whatever you like.

44:26.998 --> 44:30.423
By the way, you'll be needing this.

44:32.628 --> 44:34.847
- Really?
- Frequent ﬂyers' privilege.

44:41.971 --> 44:45.726
- Thank you.
- Don't mention it.

44:47.768 --> 44:50.738
Oh, no! Mum!

44:57.528 --> 44:58.620
Hello?

44:58.946 --> 45:01.449
- It's me again.
- Three calls in one day.

45:01.657 --> 45:04.627
I'm sorry about earlier.
Over-emotional mad day.

45:04.744 --> 45:06.963
What are you doing tonight?
Why don't you come round?

45:07.038 --> 45:09.132
I'll make something nice
and we can catch up.

45:09.874 --> 45:13.128
Yeah, tonight. Do my best.

45:13.419 --> 45:15.513
Just remind me, what day is it again?

45:15.630 --> 45:18.258
- Election day.
- Right. Of course.

45:18.424 --> 45:20.597
I'll be round for tea, roughly.

45:20.718 --> 45:22.595
- And what about...
- Anyway, I've got to go.

45:22.678 --> 45:24.726
See you later. Love you.

45:38.236 --> 45:40.364
- That's all?
- For now.

45:40.863 --> 45:42.786
- Have you voted?
- Of course.

45:43.324 --> 45:45.702
Just don't expect me
to tell you who for.

45:45.785 --> 45:50.291
Thanks for all you're doing, Mrs Jones.
Mr Saxon will be very grateful.

45:57.713 --> 45:59.681
Martha, this watch is...

46:01.175 --> 46:03.519
If anything goes wrong,
it's all down to you, Martha.

46:05.263 --> 46:07.561
It's Monday, November 10, 1913.

46:08.849 --> 46:11.147
- We make quite a team.
- Don't we just.

46:11.227 --> 46:12.747
You've quite an eye for a pretty girl.

46:12.812 --> 46:13.859
Look in the sky.

46:14.021 --> 46:15.273
Help me!

46:23.823 --> 46:27.498
"Completely human". Hmm.
