focuses on finding

00:29.525 --> 00:32.323
the best singers and giving them
an opportunity to be seen

00:32.325 --> 00:35.291

to be a part of it.

01:11.958 --> 01:15.424
He's a major producer, hitmaker,

will be more heartbreaking.

02:06.592 --> 02:08.191
It's not an easy choice
at all.

for Brennley and Lauren!

10:48.825 --> 10:51.192
We did it!
We did it!

10:53.692 --> 10:55.157
Ladies, beautiful job.
Excellent.

10:55.158 --> 10:57.224
Blake, hang tight. Let's talk
to your fellow coaches.

10:57.225 --> 10:58.257
Alicia.

10:58.258 --> 11:00.324
Ladies, that was
so beautiful.

11:00.325 --> 11:04.857
Lauren, your voice has
this honey, raspy, strong,

11:04.858 --> 11:05.991
beautiful thing happening.

11:05.992 --> 11:08.391
And, Brennley,
being 15 and talking about

11:08.392 --> 11:12.491
"I wish you were a better man,"
you know, I felt that you were

11:12.492 --> 11:15.891
very authentically clear
about what you were delivering.

11:15.892 --> 11:16.991
Thank you.

11:16.992 --> 11:19.457
But they're both
really incredible artists,

11:19.458 --> 11:20.757
so well done.

11:20.758 --> 11:22.391
Daly: Thank you, Alicia.
Gwen.

11:22.392 --> 11:24.191
[Applause]

11:24.192 --> 11:26.791
With Brennley,
I love your confidence.

11:26.792 --> 11:28.357
I think you have great style,
you know?

11:28.358 --> 11:29.491
Thank you.

11:29.492 --> 11:30.657
And I love you.
I think you're awesome.

11:30.658 --> 11:32.157
Thank you very much.

11:32.158 --> 11:35.157
Lauren,
your voice is so rich,

11:35.158 --> 11:38.991
and you have a real
kind of ease onstage.

11:38.992 --> 11:41.191
But I would probably pick
Brennley

11:41.192 --> 11:43.357
because something about
your innocence that...

11:43.358 --> 11:45.324
I would want to work with that,
you know?

11:45.325 --> 11:46.291
Thank you very much.

11:46.292 --> 11:47.824
But you're both
so incredible.

11:47.825 --> 11:49.124
Thank you, Coach.
Adam.

11:49.125 --> 11:51.024
There was so much about
what you did that spoke to

11:51.025 --> 11:52.657
where you were both at
in your lives.

11:52.658 --> 11:55.291
It was actually almost eerie in
certain moments because, Lauren,

11:55.292 --> 11:59.091
you know, you were a little bit
more comfortable and graceful

11:59.092 --> 12:00.591
in this particular moment.

12:00.592 --> 12:03.457
Brennley, you're young, and you
have that beautifully frantic,

12:03.458 --> 12:06.124
emotional energy
that is really real.

12:06.125 --> 12:07.357
You're both
in pretty great shape.

12:07.358 --> 12:08.057
Thank you, sir.
Thank you.

12:08.058 --> 12:09.824
Thank you, Adam.

12:09.825 --> 12:10.891
[Applause]

12:10.892 --> 12:12.391
Buddy.

12:12.392 --> 12:15.857
I don't want to let either one
of the two of you go, you know?

12:15.858 --> 12:19.691
But I have to, and all
this is gonna boil down to is

12:19.692 --> 12:23.924
what I can envision
moving forward with my team.

12:23.925 --> 12:25.624
Blake, who is the winner
of this battle?

12:25.625 --> 12:26.892
This one hurts me.

12:29.992 --> 12:31.958
The winner
of this battle...

12:36.492 --> 12:37.724
...is Lauren.

12:37.725 --> 12:39.357
Lauren, congratulations.

12:39.358 --> 12:41.557
You are moving on
to the Knockouts,

12:41.558 --> 12:43.991
representing Team Blake.

12:43.992 --> 12:45.725
[Cheers and applause]

12:47.325 --> 12:48.391
Way to go, sweetie.

12:48.392 --> 12:50.591
Thank you so much.
Great job. Great job.

12:50.592 --> 12:52.724
Like, my heart is pounding
out of my chest.

12:52.725 --> 12:55.757
I'm just feeling
very, very blessed right now.

12:55.758 --> 12:57.091
Daly: All right, coaches,
let me remind you,

12:57.092 --> 12:58.591
Brennley is available to steal.

12:58.592 --> 12:59.824
[Cheers and applause]

12:59.825 --> 13:02.591
That is the sound
of a steal!

13:02.592 --> 13:04.491
Yes!

13:04.492 --> 13:08.091
Gwen Stefani goes all-in!

13:08.092 --> 13:11.757
Happy birthday!
Yes, ma'am! Whoo!
On the 15-year-old,
Brennley!

13:11.758 --> 13:15.291
Don't do it.
Don't do it.

13:15.292 --> 13:16.424
It's her birthday!

13:16.425 --> 13:18.057
Daly:
Brennley, come on back.

13:18.058 --> 13:19.057
[Cheers and applause]

13:19.058 --> 13:21.224
There's another steal!
No!

13:21.225 --> 13:23.191
No way!

13:23.192 --> 13:27.224
Adam Levine uses his steal
No! No! No!

13:27.225 --> 13:28.957
on Brennley!

13:28.958 --> 13:30.524
Oh, my God!

13:30.525 --> 13:32.824
Brennley's freaking out.

13:32.825 --> 13:36.091
Obviously... Obviously,
you're not going with him.

13:36.092 --> 13:37.257
Congratulations,
Brennley.

13:37.258 --> 13:38.891
That would be
the biggest birthday mistake

13:38.892 --> 13:40.124
you'd ever make
in your entire...
Coach, you'll have
your time.

13:40.125 --> 13:42.757
Congratulations, Brennley.
You're back on "The Voice"!

13:42.758 --> 13:43.857
[Cheers and applause]

13:43.858 --> 13:45.791
In a big way!

13:45.792 --> 13:48.857
I wanted you from the moment
that you actually walked out.

13:48.858 --> 13:51.957
It's not just the voice.
With you, it's something more.

13:51.958 --> 13:54.157
It's your spirit, and I think
you're really talented,

13:54.158 --> 13:55.957
and I just feel an instinct
to want to work with you.

13:55.958 --> 13:57.591
That's it.
It's just very honest.

13:57.592 --> 13:59.091
Thank you.
Daly: Thank you, Coach.

13:59.092 --> 14:00.391
Adam.

14:00.392 --> 14:03.291
What I'd like to do right now
is leave this crowd.

14:03.292 --> 14:04.424
[Blake laughs]

14:04.425 --> 14:06.424
And what we should be doing,
more importantly

14:06.425 --> 14:07.757
than selling ourselves,
right?

14:07.758 --> 14:10.224
We should be singing
"Happy Birthday," right?

Welcome back to the battles.

15:47.089 --> 15:48.975
Before the break,
both Adam and Gwen

15:48.977 --> 15:51.391
hit their buttons
to steal Brennley Brown.

15:51.392 --> 15:53.857

I'd rather see one of my better
artists go to Gwen's team

16:24.158 --> 16:28.491
than Adam's team because,
you know, Adam is... is evil.

She is so...
She is incredible.

16:45.892 --> 16:47.691
Daly: While Gwen celebrates
her first steal,

16:47.692 --> 16:50.691
let's meet her adviser...
five-time Grammy award winner

16:50.692 --> 16:55.091
with over 200 million albums
sold, pop legend Céline Dion.

16:55.092 --> 16:57.557
I have the real Céline Dion
right here.

16:57.558 --> 16:59.257
I'm so honored
to have you here.

16:59.258 --> 17:01.291
It's unbelievable
how many people love you.

17:01.292 --> 17:02.957
I'm here to learn
from you today.

17:02.958 --> 17:05.656
The person that I got to have
as my adviser

17:05.657 --> 17:08.590
is the one and only Céline Dion.

17:08.592 --> 17:10.191
Her music speaks to the world

17:10.192 --> 17:13.424
and transcends
all these language barriers.

17:13.425 --> 17:15.057
It's just incredible
to be around someone

17:15.058 --> 17:17.023
that's been able to touch
so many people.

17:17.025 --> 17:18.790
She really is a phenomenon.

17:18.791 --> 17:21.391
My way of seeing
this whole thing is that

17:21.392 --> 17:23.824
if you give the best
of yourself,

17:23.825 --> 17:25.290
there's a spot for you.

17:25.291 --> 17:28.657
That's exactly what they need
to hear, like, today.

17:28.658 --> 17:30.091
So that means
I have to start all over again,

17:30.092 --> 17:31.791
what I just said?
Yes. [Laughs]

17:31.792 --> 17:35.391
Céline:
What I like about "The Voice"
is that I get to be stunned

17:35.392 --> 17:36.657
by amazing talents.

17:36.658 --> 17:38.424
But this is the new generation,

17:38.425 --> 17:42.557
so we really have to take
responsibility as mentors

17:42.558 --> 17:44.557
to give them some tools.

17:44.558 --> 17:45.891
[As Elvis]
Thank you very much.

17:45.892 --> 17:48.591

18:04.325 --> 18:05.424

18:05.425 --> 18:07.657
It was so special
to see Ms. Céline Dion.

18:07.658 --> 18:08.757
She's one of the greats.

18:08.758 --> 18:10.357
Let me feel your pulse
for a second.

18:10.358 --> 18:11.757
Okay, you're okay.

18:11.758 --> 18:15.491
She's an amazing vocalist,
and to be coached and advised

18:15.492 --> 18:18.091
by two legends
in the business...

18:18.092 --> 18:19.391
Oh, my heart's
beating fast.

18:19.392 --> 18:20.924
...I'm speechless about it.

18:20.925 --> 18:22.091
Are you okay?

18:22.092 --> 18:24.557
I'm just wowed right now.
That's awesome.

18:24.558 --> 18:27.824
Before the blind auditions, I
worked with special-needs kids,

My dad plays the banjo
and sings.

I paired JChosen and Kenny P
because when they sing,

in front of these legends.

19:50.658 --> 19:51.924
It's intimidating.

19:51.925 --> 19:54.857
J, I felt that you were
a little bit restricted.

19:54.858 --> 19:57.591

Mm.
So today, it's okay.

20:38.525 --> 20:42.457
JChosen is so talented, but
today I saw that nervous side

20:42.458 --> 20:44.091
that I wasn't expecting.

20:44.092 --> 20:47.024
Kenny, your head voice
is so strong!

20:47.025 --> 20:48.257
It's unbelievable.

I got a lot of power,
he's got a lot of control.

21:04.358 --> 21:06.791

have to work hard

21:06.792 --> 21:08.491
to take him in this battle.

21:08.492 --> 21:11.557
I think the song is perfect
because it's the soul side,

21:11.558 --> 21:13.924
it's the rock side,
and you need to figure out

JChosen was a four-chair turn.

21:22.958 --> 21:26.724
His voice is gorgeous,
but I have the sneaky suspicion

21:26.725 --> 21:28.191
that he's holding back
something,

21:28.192 --> 21:29.757
and Kenny P really showed us

21:29.758 --> 21:32.924
that he could tackle this song

27:58.958 --> 28:01.958

Whoo!
Excellent battle.

This is gonna be
a tough one, Gwen.

Adam, what do you
want to add to that?

28:07.825 --> 28:09.757
I wanted you on my team,
JChosen!

28:09.758 --> 28:11.224

an incredible way of performing,

28:15.792 --> 28:17.091

Kenny, I did not turn around
for you, but I love this show

28:19.758 --> 28:22.124
because it always is
a beautiful surprise

28:22.125 --> 28:24.424
when you become a fan
of someone that you
might not have understood

28:24.425 --> 28:26.457
in the first, you know,
90 seconds that you heard.

28:26.458 --> 28:27.524
You're great, man.
Thank you.

28:27.525 --> 28:29.157
You guys are both,
to me, dead even.

28:29.158 --> 28:30.224

Thank you, Coach Adam.
Blake Shelton.

28:32.858 --> 28:35.324
J... his voice
is so smooth.

28:35.325 --> 28:37.924
About anything you think of,
you're capable of singing.

28:37.925 --> 28:39.624
[Sighs] I hate you for that,
actually,

28:39.625 --> 28:40.624
now that I think
about it.

28:40.625 --> 28:41.757
[Laughter]

28:41.758 --> 28:44.224
And then Kenny has
an edginess to his voice

28:44.225 --> 28:46.224
that I think's really cool,
too, you know?

28:46.225 --> 28:48.624
I don't know what I would do
if I was you right now.

28:48.625 --> 28:50.057
Thanks for nothing,
Blake.

28:50.058 --> 28:52.091
Thank you, Blake.
Alicia.

28:52.092 --> 28:54.757
Kenny, you totally blew a hole
in what anybody thought

28:54.758 --> 28:56.757
might have happened
on that stage,

28:56.758 --> 28:58.224
and I thought
that was very exciting.

28:58.225 --> 29:00.324
and I love
those kind of high falsettos,

29:00.325 --> 29:02.224
and I love the dance
that y'all did.

29:02.225 --> 29:04.691
I really enjoyed
the camaraderie.

29:04.692 --> 29:05.924
All right, Alicia.

But, Gwen, you, of course,
have the final decision.

I feel like you really know who
you are and what kind of music

29:16.025 --> 29:18.757
you want to make, and I think
there's something really special

29:18.758 --> 29:20.157
and powerful about that.

29:20.158 --> 29:23.257
With J, during rehearsals,
you seemed kind of nervous.

29:23.258 --> 29:26.324
Today, I was trying to look for
that, and all of that was gone.

I did not know
what I was gonna do.

what I'm gonna do.

J, once he got onstage, all
his personality was coming out.

30:11.192 --> 30:14.724
He's a front runner on my team
because of his vocal ability

30:14.725 --> 30:16.557
and his presence onstage.

30:16.558 --> 30:17.624
I just love that.

you want to say to Gwen?

a ton of fun doing this.

You're so incredible.

I didn't push for Kenny,
just because he's not exactly

30:56.058 --> 30:59.224
what I'm looking for on my team,
but I thought that they both

30:59.225 --> 31:02.957
performed with so much, just,
energy and joy,

31:02.958 --> 31:04.624

all of a sudden,

39:47.133 --> 39:49.466
putting these notes in
that I didn't expect,

39:49.467 --> 39:51.332
and I think
you're super-talented.

39:51.333 --> 39:52.566
Very, very talented.
Thank you.

39:52.567 --> 39:54.232
Thank you, Gwen.

concert packed into two minutes.

39:56.967 --> 39:58.632

39:58.633 --> 40:01.432
Anatalia, I'm not convinced
that you're not a wind-up toy.

40:01.433 --> 40:02.599
Do you ever run track?

40:02.600 --> 40:04.066
I feel like you're the fastest
person in the world.

40:04.067 --> 40:05.166
No, I don't.

40:05.167 --> 40:08.066
You're just fast.
Everything's "Whew!"

40:08.067 --> 40:11.899
And also amazing, and that's...
that's what make it hard, Missy,

40:11.900 --> 40:13.566
is that you are like
the anchor here

40:13.567 --> 40:15.999
because you're actually, like,
I can see you and, like,

40:16.000 --> 40:18.366
you're not just a blur
that's running across the stage.

40:18.367 --> 40:19.432
Sorry.

40:19.433 --> 40:20.999
What I hope doesn't get lost
on you guys

40:21.000 --> 40:24.899
is how good Missy is,
because this is "The Voice,"

40:24.900 --> 40:26.732
and you have
a tremendous voice.

40:26.733 --> 40:29.466
I might be, in this moment,
more attracted to

40:29.467 --> 40:30.966
what you
were doing, Missy.
Thank you.

40:30.967 --> 40:33.066

It's hard to not pay attention
to you when you're onstage.

40:53.567 --> 40:55.899
And that's why I'm glad
Missy stopped,

40:55.900 --> 40:58.666
and she was like,
"I'm about to sing some stuff

40:58.667 --> 41:01.632
that you guys are gonna
pay attention to, damn it."

41:01.633 --> 41:02.666

44:35.183 --> 44:37.349

work out with John Legend,

44:40.150 --> 44:42.116
I wouldn't trade that
for the world,

I was always really into music,

45:11.417 --> 45:12.582
but I was overweight,

45:12.583 --> 45:14.649
and it was just
a really hard time for me.

45:14.650 --> 45:17.682
When I was 14 years old, I won
this Justin Bieber contest.

Made me rethink, you know, what
I was thinking about myself.

52:36.783 --> 52:39.916
I think you're really special,
and you really owned that one.

52:39.917 --> 52:42.282
Like, I could see that
being your record, no problem.

52:42.283 --> 52:43.549
Like,
I'm a fan of you already

52:43.550 --> 52:45.549
just from the moment
that you started singing.

52:45.550 --> 52:46.449
Thank you.

52:46.450 --> 52:48.382
Gaby, you look stunning.

52:48.383 --> 52:49.349
Alicia: Yes.

52:49.350 --> 52:50.682
Your voice
is so beautiful.

52:50.683 --> 52:52.816
Some of those high notes
were so pretty,

52:52.817 --> 52:54.449
and it was just
the whole package,

52:54.450 --> 52:55.982
and I thought
you did great.

52:55.983 --> 52:58.716
I was leaning towards Mark,
but both incredible.

52:58.717 --> 52:59.849
Daly: All right.

52:59.850 --> 53:02.149
Adam, you've got
the final decision.

53:02.150 --> 53:03.582
You guys had
a lot of great chemistry.

53:03.583 --> 53:04.682
You're both great singers,

53:04.683 --> 53:06.949
really both very dynamic,
very different.

53:06.950 --> 53:08.416
But you really
fit up there together.

53:08.417 --> 53:11.582
You know, Mark, Gwen talks about
reacting the way she did.

53:11.583 --> 53:13.549
You know, there's something
about great singing

53:13.550 --> 53:14.882
that is hard to explain.

53:14.883 --> 53:16.549
It's just one of those things
that when it happens,

53:16.550 --> 53:18.549
it happens to you,
and you feel it.

53:18.550 --> 53:21.282
And that is a strong,
very potent thing.

53:21.283 --> 53:22.949
And then I think about,
you know, Gaby,

53:22.950 --> 53:25.249
you're stunning,
and you sing so beautifully,

53:25.250 --> 53:27.149
and that's a valuable
and amazing thing to have

53:27.150 --> 53:28.449
as an artist.

53:28.450 --> 53:29.849
So this is not
an easy thing.

53:29.850 --> 53:32.482
Adam, who's the winner
of this battle?

53:32.483 --> 53:33.882
Um...

53:33.883 --> 53:36.550
The winner
of this battle...

53:42.817 --> 53:43.982
...is Mark.

53:43.983 --> 53:45.282
Mark, congratulations.

53:45.283 --> 53:47.216

to the Knockouts,

Adam:
Mark's voice gives you comfort.
It's a special voice.

53:53.583 --> 53:55.216
I think he can do
a lot of different things.

53:55.217 --> 53:57.482
We'll have to just explore it.

54:14.850 --> 54:16.616
Thank you for turning around
that first time,

54:16.617 --> 54:18.416
when I had
zero confidence.

54:18.417 --> 54:20.382
Oh, of course.
I mean, you're wonderful.

Being sick and having cancer
and getting better

for this day.

Daly: Give it up
for Felicia and Quizz!

01:04:06.350 --> 01:04:07.516
Alicia, tough decision
coming up.

01:04:07.517 --> 01:04:08.849
Gwen, help her out.

01:04:08.850 --> 01:04:12.049
Quizz, you have such a unique,
like, tone to your voice,

01:04:12.050 --> 01:04:13.682
so I kept leaning
towards you,

01:04:13.683 --> 01:04:16.416
and then as the battle
was going on,

01:04:16.417 --> 01:04:18.916
Felicia, your voice, your tone,
you're so warm

01:04:18.917 --> 01:04:20.782
Yeah.
and so, like, round.

01:04:20.783 --> 01:04:22.216
I think you're both
really talented.

01:04:22.217 --> 01:04:24.882
If I had to choose right now,
today, right this second,

01:04:24.883 --> 01:04:26.516
I'd probably have to go
with Quizz,

01:04:26.517 --> 01:04:29.149
just because you're 13
and that blows my mind.

01:04:29.150 --> 01:04:30.649
Thank you.

01:04:30.650 --> 01:04:33.182
Daly: Thank you, Gwen.
Adam.

01:04:33.183 --> 01:04:35.416
Felicia, the only thing

01:04:35.417 --> 01:04:36.782
that you don't have
going for you

01:04:36.783 --> 01:04:38.516
is that you're not
13 years old, because...

01:04:38.517 --> 01:04:39.816
[Laughter]

01:04:39.817 --> 01:04:41.882
...like, you guys are
just superduper different.

01:04:41.883 --> 01:04:45.182
In this particular scenario,
I might actually go with Felicia

01:04:45.183 --> 01:04:46.782
because I thought
there were moments

01:04:46.783 --> 01:04:48.182
that really tore through,

01:04:48.183 --> 01:04:49.882
but, Quizz,
that is [scoffs]

01:04:49.883 --> 01:04:51.316
you're incredible,
as well, so...
Thank you.

01:04:51.317 --> 01:04:52.382
Thank you, Coach Adam.

01:04:52.383 --> 01:04:54.616
Blake Shelton.

01:04:54.617 --> 01:04:56.682
Quizz, as long as
you're on this show,

01:04:56.683 --> 01:04:59.116
you're going to be
constantly reminded

01:04:59.117 --> 01:05:01.116
that you're 13 years old.
Yeah. Yes.

01:05:01.117 --> 01:05:03.949
Everybody's just,
"13! He's 13! 13!"

01:05:03.950 --> 01:05:07.282
But Felicia
has been 13 before, too,

01:05:07.283 --> 01:05:10.849
and so, you know, that's...
you know, she did it.

01:05:10.850 --> 01:05:14.149
I can't say enough
about Felicia's voice.

01:05:14.150 --> 01:05:15.949
You can just hear
the warmth

01:05:15.950 --> 01:05:18.049
and that rounder tone
that she has.

01:05:18.050 --> 01:05:21.049
It's just
a more developed voice.

01:05:21.050 --> 01:05:22.449
I would have to
go with Felicia,

01:05:22.450 --> 01:05:24.782
just based on
what I heard right there.

01:05:24.783 --> 01:05:26.082
Blake, thank you.

01:05:26.083 --> 01:05:30.482
Coach Alicia, you, of course,
have the final decision.

01:05:30.483 --> 01:05:33.716
Felicia, I loved
seeing your personal triumph

01:05:33.717 --> 01:05:35.516
and being able
to learn about that.

01:05:35.517 --> 01:05:36.949
Sometimes as women,

01:05:36.950 --> 01:05:40.049
we kind of build up this shield
to protect ourselves with,

01:05:40.050 --> 01:05:42.649
and I'd love to see you
break that shield down

01:05:42.650 --> 01:05:44.616
and expose yourself,

01:05:44.617 --> 01:05:46.749
and I felt
that you did that.

01:05:46.750 --> 01:05:48.982
Quizz, you have
a lot of experience

01:05:48.983 --> 01:05:50.282
even at such a young age,

01:05:50.283 --> 01:05:53.282
and your voice is already
in such an incredible place,

01:05:53.283 --> 01:05:55.649
and you're only gonna
go farther.

01:05:55.650 --> 01:05:57.782
You took direction
really well.

01:05:57.783 --> 01:06:02.349
So, really, both of you
succeeded in an incredible way.

01:06:02.350 --> 01:06:05.249
Um... it is now the time.

01:06:05.250 --> 01:06:06.316
What a hard decision
for you.

01:06:06.317 --> 01:06:08.649
Alicia, who's the winner
of this battle?

01:06:08.650 --> 01:06:11.682

of this battle...

01:06:21.683 --> 01:06:22.916
...is Quizz.

01:06:22.917 --> 01:06:26.849
Quizz is gonna move on
to the Knockout rounds,

01:06:26.850 --> 01:06:27.849
representing...

01:06:27.850 --> 01:06:29.482
Congratulations, baby.

Nice job, Quizz.

01:06:34.617 --> 01:06:36.682
Alicia: I chose Quizz
because he has an innocence

01:06:36.683 --> 01:06:39.049
and a vocal prowess
that's just undeniable.

01:06:39.050 --> 01:06:40.816
[Cheers and applause]

01:06:40.817 --> 01:06:42.682

that all this hard work

01:06:42.683 --> 01:06:44.116
has just paid off.

01:06:44.117 --> 01:06:47.082
Coaches, let me remind you,
Felicia is available to steal.

01:06:47.083 --> 01:06:49.716
[Audience shouting "Steal!"]
Felicia, anything
you'd like to say to your coach?

01:06:49.717 --> 01:06:52.816
I just want to say it has been
the privilege of my life

01:06:52.817 --> 01:06:53.949
to work with you.
Mm.

01:06:53.950 --> 01:06:55.249

you know?

said it best when...

[Laughter]

01:07:27.150 --> 01:07:28.882
...he said the only thing

01:07:28.883 --> 01:07:30.616
that she didn't have
going for her

01:07:30.617 --> 01:07:32.782
is that she's not 13,

01:07:32.783 --> 01:07:34.949
and it's just...
you know, there's no reason

01:07:34.950 --> 01:07:36.382
that she can't
win this thing.

01:07:36.383 --> 01:07:37.782
I want to keep her
in the competition.

01:07:37.783 --> 01:07:39.049

01:07:43.817 --> 01:07:46.349

is nobody else like Felicia

01:07:46.350 --> 01:07:48.549
on my team,
and that's a good thing.

I hope you do well.

01:09:32.483 --> 01:09:35.015
Blake's been bragging
on you guys.
Ooh.

01:09:35.017 --> 01:09:37.816
He said your auditions
were pretty good.
Incredible.

01:09:37.817 --> 01:09:38.881
See, now he's nervous
in front of us.

01:09:38.883 --> 01:09:40.482
See?
[Laughs]

01:09:40.483 --> 01:09:42.116
I love you.
I love you back.

01:09:42.117 --> 01:09:44.316
Ashley: My dad is 76,

01:09:44.317 --> 01:09:46.881
and he has
early-onset Alzheimer's,

01:09:46.883 --> 01:09:49.549
so having to move away
to Nashville

01:09:49.550 --> 01:09:53.049
to pursue my dream,
it was really difficult.

01:10:00.517 --> 01:10:02.516
Country music
is a sacred thing.

01:10:02.517 --> 01:10:05.282
I would hate to see you
become an experiment.

01:10:05.283 --> 01:10:07.749
I pick Blake.
Yes!

01:10:07.750 --> 01:10:10.549
Casi:
I have been living in Nashville
for almost two years now.

01:10:10.550 --> 01:10:12.216
I'm playing just for tips,

01:10:12.217 --> 01:10:15.049
so there's definitely
a financial struggle.

01:10:15.050 --> 01:10:16.849

I'm glad you're here.

01:10:16.850 --> 01:10:18.182

he's just always been
really supportive.

already mastered that...

is perfect for either one

is that classic country sound

that reminds me
of a Tammy Wynette.

I mean, it's complementing,
and the front is unbelievable.

Don't you agree,

Mm-hmm.

01:11:41.317 --> 01:11:42.916

catching the front of that word.

You're not gonna hurt yourself,
in my opinion,

01:12:24.983 --> 01:12:29.582
by just really doing the line
as it is really solid and great.

What you want to do here,
really,

can't live without,

01:18:12.800 --> 01:18:14.899
It was, like,
bona fide battle status.

01:18:14.900 --> 01:18:16.199
Oh, yeah.
You know what I mean?

01:18:16.200 --> 01:18:17.932
Oh, yeah.
They were coming for it.

01:18:17.933 --> 01:18:21.099
That was a boxing match, like,
posing as a singing competition.

01:18:21.100 --> 01:18:22.332
[Laughter]

01:18:22.333 --> 01:18:23.699
Which is good.

01:18:23.700 --> 01:18:27.799
Casi, you have such a
very vibrant, vivacious energy,

01:18:27.800 --> 01:18:30.399
and, Ashley, there's a bit
more reserve inside of you,

01:18:30.400 --> 01:18:32.399
but I have a feeling
that there's an outpouring

01:18:32.400 --> 01:18:33.499
that's just waiting
to pour.

01:18:33.500 --> 01:18:34.499
Oh, it is.

01:18:34.500 --> 01:18:36.966
This is
really, really tough,

01:18:36.967 --> 01:18:39.099
and I don't feel good
for you.

01:18:39.100 --> 01:18:41.099
That's my advice.
That's your input?
That's what you got?

01:18:41.100 --> 01:18:42.099
Oh, thanks.

01:18:42.100 --> 01:18:43.699
[Laughter]

01:18:43.700 --> 01:18:46.132
All right, we'll move on
down the line. Gwen.

01:18:46.133 --> 01:18:48.132
Both of your voices
are so beautiful.

01:18:48.133 --> 01:18:50.799
Casi, I feel like you're
a little bit more seasoned.

01:18:50.800 --> 01:18:52.866
There's just something
professional about you,

01:18:52.867 --> 01:18:54.599
but if you want to go
with someone

01:18:54.600 --> 01:18:56.399
that just needs
a little bit of help

01:18:56.400 --> 01:18:57.932
as far as, like,
stage presence goes,

01:18:57.933 --> 01:19:00.432
then she has
a beautiful, beautiful voice.

01:19:00.433 --> 01:19:02.232
All right,
thank you very much, Gwen.

01:19:02.233 --> 01:19:03.632
Adam.

01:19:03.633 --> 01:19:05.666
You're both big-time,
like, singers here.

01:19:05.667 --> 01:19:08.232
I don't know how you wound up
in the same pairing.

01:19:08.233 --> 01:19:10.532
That probably has
something to do with Dum-Dum.

01:19:10.533 --> 01:19:11.666
[Laughter]

01:19:11.667 --> 01:19:15.099
But, Ashley,
I thought you came out today

01:19:15.100 --> 01:19:16.466
and you might've taken it.

01:19:16.467 --> 01:19:17.599
Thanks, Ellen.

01:19:17.600 --> 01:19:20.566
[Laughter]

01:19:20.567 --> 01:19:22.999
So good.

01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:24.799
I told you girls

01:19:24.800 --> 01:19:27.499
from the second
I heard you singing together

01:19:27.500 --> 01:19:29.466
I wish I hadn't
put you together,

01:19:29.467 --> 01:19:31.666
but at the end of the day,
I almost have to,

01:19:31.667 --> 01:19:34.266
because to me, we need
to get those two artists

01:19:34.267 --> 01:19:35.732
out of each other's lane,

01:19:35.733 --> 01:19:38.232
and I think
you're both so talented

01:19:38.233 --> 01:19:42.666
that I pray, I hope that
everybody stays on the show,

01:19:42.667 --> 01:19:45.932
'cause it's undeniable
how badly the other coaches

01:19:45.933 --> 01:19:48.332
want to beat me
with a country artist.

01:19:48.333 --> 01:19:49.732
I'll beat you
with anything, really.

01:19:49.733 --> 01:19:51.532
I could beat you with a shovel,
I'll beat you with a...

01:19:51.533 --> 01:19:53.232
[Laughter]

01:19:53.233 --> 01:19:55.199
Violent.
Alicia: Right.

01:19:55.200 --> 01:19:56.132
Violent.

01:19:56.133 --> 01:19:57.632
[Southern accent]
Violent.

01:19:57.633 --> 01:20:00.367
Blake, tough decision. Who is
the winner of this battle?

01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:04.432
I think, in this case,

01:20:04.433 --> 01:20:07.732
I have to just kind of go
with a gut feeling.

01:20:07.733 --> 01:20:09.866
Uh...

01:20:09.867 --> 01:20:12.999
The winner
of this battle...

01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:14.132
was Casi.

01:20:14.133 --> 01:20:16.466
[Cheers and applause]

01:20:16.467 --> 01:20:18.666
Casi Joy moves on
to the Knockouts...

01:20:18.667 --> 01:20:21.732
congratulations...
representing Team Blake!

01:20:21.733 --> 01:20:24.066
Blake:
I ultimately went with Casi
because she just has

01:20:24.067 --> 01:20:26.766
this electric energy
when she's onstage.

01:20:26.767 --> 01:20:29.632
Great job.
Thank you so much.

01:20:29.633 --> 01:20:32.366
The unique things
that Casi can do vocally,

01:20:32.367 --> 01:20:35.166
I want to continue to explore
moving forward with her.

01:20:35.167 --> 01:20:36.799
[Cheers and applause]

01:20:36.800 --> 01:20:38.966
Casi:
I've just wanted this so bad,

01:20:38.967 --> 01:20:40.399
and to hear "yes"

01:20:40.400 --> 01:20:43.099
from somebody I've looked up to
my whole entire life...

01:20:43.100 --> 01:20:44.432
[Chuckles]

01:20:44.433 --> 01:20:45.866
[Voice breaking]
...it's everything.

01:20:45.867 --> 01:20:48.866
Coaches, let me remind you,
Ashley is available to steal.

01:20:48.867 --> 01:20:50.699
Ashley, anything
you'd like to say to Blake?

01:20:50.700 --> 01:20:52.766
I would like to say
thank you so much.

01:20:52.767 --> 01:20:55.266
Working with you has been
a dream come true so far.

01:20:55.267 --> 01:20:56.766
[Audience shouting "Steal!"]

01:20:56.767 --> 01:20:58.732
And I'm really grateful...

01:20:58.733 --> 01:21:00.699
Yes! Yes!
That is a steal!

01:21:00.700 --> 01:21:02.499
And another one!

01:21:02.500 --> 01:21:04.199
A double steal!

01:21:04.200 --> 01:21:05.766
[Cheers and applause]

01:21:05.767 --> 01:21:07.432
Ohh!
For Ashley!

01:21:07.433 --> 01:21:10.199
Make it three!
Yeah!

01:21:10.200 --> 01:21:11.567
[Laughs]
Yeah!

01:21:13.733 --> 01:21:14.732
Wow.

01:21:14.733 --> 01:21:16.566
[Laughs]
Wow!

01:21:16.567 --> 01:21:18.166
I can't remember the last time
I've ever seen

01:21:18.167 --> 01:21:20.799
all the other coaches
go all-in.

01:21:20.800 --> 01:21:22.532
Wow!
Which leads me
to my first point.

01:21:22.533 --> 01:21:23.999
Blake: Whoo!

01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:25.932
There are leaders
and there are followers, Ashley.

01:21:25.933 --> 01:21:27.566
You know what?
I actually...

01:21:27.567 --> 01:21:28.899
No, I was trying...
Gwen was right behind you.

01:21:28.900 --> 01:21:30.032
I was trying to be, like...

01:21:30.033 --> 01:21:31.799
Sometimes it takes a pioneer
to lay it down,

01:21:31.800 --> 01:21:33.699
and then they fall
like dominoes.
No! That's not true!

01:21:33.700 --> 01:21:35.766
Or you could be really...
like, I had a creative plan.

01:21:35.767 --> 01:21:37.099
Like, as soon as
you were walking off,

01:21:37.100 --> 01:21:38.632
I press the button.
I had a plan already.

01:21:38.633 --> 01:21:40.032
And it was gonna be,
like, really cool,

01:21:40.033 --> 01:21:41.499
and then this guy...

01:21:41.500 --> 01:21:42.899
A few things
are about to happen.

01:21:42.900 --> 01:21:47.766
Gwen, along with Blake,
will get together.

01:21:47.767 --> 01:21:49.399
A lot.

01:21:49.400 --> 01:21:50.799
As they already are.

01:21:50.800 --> 01:21:52.166
They spend a lot of time.

01:21:52.167 --> 01:21:57.299
And they are going to pitch
Team Shelton/Stefani.

01:21:57.300 --> 01:21:58.332
They're gonna do that thing

01:21:58.333 --> 01:21:59.566
and they're gonna be
super-charming...

01:21:59.567 --> 01:22:00.899
We wouldn't do that
to Alicia.

01:22:00.900 --> 01:22:02.566
Thank you.
Yeah, they're also gonna do...
Hold on.

01:22:02.567 --> 01:22:04.132
They're also gonna...
We'd do it to you.

01:22:04.133 --> 01:22:05.432
[Laughter]

01:22:05.433 --> 01:22:07.266
Sorry... back to my point
before I was rudely interrupted

01:22:07.267 --> 01:22:08.632
by the man
who betrayed you.

01:22:08.633 --> 01:22:10.099
[Laughter]

01:22:10.100 --> 01:22:12.199
I thought that you won,

01:22:12.200 --> 01:22:15.132
and I am the only person
that actually said that,

01:22:15.133 --> 01:22:17.599
so just remember that when
you're making your decision.

01:22:17.600 --> 01:22:19.466
Lot to remember,
Ashley.

01:22:19.467 --> 01:22:21.232
Is he finished?

01:22:21.233 --> 01:22:22.732
Lot to remember
That was a lot.

01:22:22.733 --> 01:22:24.799
I feel like you'd have to listen
to a lot of talking

01:22:24.800 --> 01:22:26.166
if you went to Adam, right?
Oh, my gosh!

01:22:26.167 --> 01:22:27.232
That's a lot of talking.

01:22:27.233 --> 01:22:28.732
Every single word relevant.

01:22:28.733 --> 01:22:30.399
No fat. Trim the fat.

01:22:30.400 --> 01:22:32.566
Daly: Let's go right down
the line. Gwen.

01:22:32.567 --> 01:22:36.499
Ashley, I obviously have
a newfound love for country.

01:22:36.500 --> 01:22:38.299
I mean, major.

01:22:38.300 --> 01:22:39.499
See what I mean, Ashley?

01:22:39.500 --> 01:22:41.699
No, but I think
what's interesting about it

01:22:41.700 --> 01:22:44.466
is that it's this new world
that I never knew about.

01:22:44.467 --> 01:22:46.166
I literally have
playlists of music

01:22:46.167 --> 01:22:47.432
I've never heard before,

01:22:47.433 --> 01:22:49.899
and it's just so beautiful
to discover something

01:22:49.900 --> 01:22:51.932
that is so important.

01:22:51.933 --> 01:22:54.232
I feel like I could help you
so much

01:22:54.233 --> 01:22:56.399
as far as how to work the stage
as a girl,

01:22:56.400 --> 01:22:58.166
'cause that's what I've done,
you know, my whole life.

01:22:58.167 --> 01:22:59.099
Me too.

01:22:59.100 --> 01:23:00.299
So there's, um...

01:23:00.300 --> 01:23:01.399
As a girl.

01:23:01.400 --> 01:23:03.166
As a girl.
[Laughs]

01:23:03.167 --> 01:23:04.332
I'd love to work with you.

01:23:04.333 --> 01:23:07.232
There you go.
Alicia Keys.

01:23:07.233 --> 01:23:10.132
Ashley, I feel like not only
did you show your vocal prowess

01:23:10.133 --> 01:23:12.466
and your skill and your desire
and your joy and your love

01:23:12.467 --> 01:23:15.332
and everything came through,
you have so much to say,

01:23:15.333 --> 01:23:16.999
and I'd love
to discover you

01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:19.866
and find out more
about who you want to be.

01:23:19.867 --> 01:23:22.332
And if you recall,
Adam was the only one

01:23:22.333 --> 01:23:24.899
that didn't turn his chair
for you.

01:23:24.900 --> 01:23:26.666
Whoa!
So, just... in his facts,
he forgot.

01:23:26.667 --> 01:23:27.666
That doesn't matter.

01:23:27.667 --> 01:23:29.566
That is a fact.
You're right.

01:23:29.567 --> 01:23:32.599
Anyway, I've always said
that soul music

01:23:32.600 --> 01:23:34.699
and country music
belong together,

01:23:34.700 --> 01:23:36.132
and I would love
to be the coach

01:23:36.133 --> 01:23:37.632
that just takes you
to the next level.

01:23:37.633 --> 01:23:40.399
Wow,
ladies and gentlemen.

01:23:40.400 --> 01:23:42.166
Ashley.
[Groans]

01:23:42.167 --> 01:23:43.666
Pick your new coach.

01:23:43.667 --> 01:23:46.299
[Audience shouting]

01:23:46.300 --> 01:23:47.567
[Laughs]

01:23:48.900 --> 01:23:50.932
So hard.

01:23:50.933 --> 01:23:52.733
Whoo!

01:23:55.033 --> 01:23:56.632
Uh...

01:23:56.633 --> 01:23:58.467
[Shouting continues]

01:24:01.700 --> 01:24:02.899
Okay, um...

01:24:02.900 --> 01:24:04.232
I pick Alicia.

01:24:04.233 --> 01:24:05.866
Daly: Alicia Keys...
Whoo-hoo!

01:24:05.867 --> 01:24:08.167
...steals Ashley
from Team Blake!

01:24:13.367 --> 01:24:16.566
I am ecstatic about this steal.

01:24:16.567 --> 01:24:18.466
Like, seriously,
I feel like Ashley

01:24:18.467 --> 01:24:20.266
has something incredible
to offer.

01:24:20.267 --> 01:24:22.232
I love her.

01:24:22.233 --> 01:24:23.232
Score!

01:24:23.233 --> 01:24:24.632
Ahhhh!

01:24:24.633 --> 01:24:26.599
I will wear you down.

01:24:26.600 --> 01:24:27.899
Just know that.

01:24:27.900 --> 01:24:30.099
Ahhhh!
[Laughs]

01:24:30.100 --> 01:24:31.832
Blake: The only bright spot
about the fact

01:24:31.833 --> 01:24:33.099
that Ashley isn't on my team

01:24:33.100 --> 01:24:35.099
is that she didn't end up
on Adam's team.

01:24:35.100 --> 01:24:37.199
So happy she didn't pick him.

01:24:37.200 --> 01:24:39.532
Yay. Okay?
Thank you so much.

01:24:39.533 --> 01:24:40.866
Thank you.

01:24:40.867 --> 01:24:41.932
So excited.

01:24:41.933 --> 01:24:42.977
Yes!

01:24:42.979 --> 01:24:44.347
Mmm!
