WEBVTT

00:25.037 --> 00:27.601
I can't believe we're actually
going to be inside his house

00:28.763 --> 00:30.023
No talking, people.

01:35.791 --> 01:37.506
All right, folks, you all know
the ground rules.

01:37.508 --> 01:39.065
No talking to each other,
no touching

01:39.069 --> 01:40.613
anything in the house. Stay with the group.

01:58.437 --> 01:59.608
What's he doing here?

01:59.994 --> 02:01.059
He's coming with us.

02:01.192 --> 02:02.323
That's creepy.

02:03.634 --> 02:05.404
Mr. Lopez has a right to be here.

02:05.737 --> 02:08.318
He's entitled to see any evidence
presented in his case.

02:08.852 --> 02:10.036
Follow me, please.

02:24.509 --> 02:26.026
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury

02:26.559 --> 02:28.394
in the matter of The State of Florida vs

02:28.395 --> 02:29.632
Donny Lopez,

02:29.633 --> 02:31.310
the People will show that, on the night

02:31.316 --> 02:32.767
of January 16

02:33.366 --> 02:34.484
the defendant

02:34.537 --> 02:37.492
entered his residence at 1620 Silver Strand

02:38.110 --> 02:39.347
a residence you will be visiting

02:39.348 --> 02:40.692
during the course of this trial.

02:41.491 --> 02:43.273
On the night in question, Donny Lopez

02:43.274 --> 02:45.085
was confronted by his wife, Miranda.

02:46.036 --> 02:48.632
they argued about the defendant's infidelity

02:48.711 --> 02:50.015
a contention supported by

02:50.016 --> 02:51.573
a long auburn hair

02:51.586 --> 02:53.383
found on the defendant by the Crime Lab.

02:54.699 --> 02:56.609
That argument quickly became physical

03:00.342 --> 03:02.499
And was witnessed through
a window by a neighbor

03:02.571 --> 03:05.778
who will testify that she saw
Miranda Lopez just moments

03:05.779 --> 03:07.296
before her brutal murder.

03:09.413 --> 03:11.169
Miranda Lopez was stabbed twice.

03:11.758 --> 03:13.462
She had defensive wounds on her hands.

03:13.475 --> 03:14.939
She was fighting for her life.

03:15.472 --> 03:16.603
A fight that she lost.

03:26.206 --> 03:28.043
She bled to death on the kitchen floor

03:28.136 --> 03:29.880
while her children slept upstairs.

03:31.590 --> 03:34.039
Donny Lopez waited a half hour to call 911.

03:34.825 --> 03:36.369
First, he tried to clean up.

03:47.843 --> 03:48.615
What happened?

03:54.045 --> 03:55.243
What's wrong with her?

03:56.327 --> 03:58.217
I think she's having some kind of seizure.

04:00.001 --> 04:01.011
What happened?

04:01.012 --> 04:02.210
Is everyone okay?

04:04.462 --> 04:05.606
Shouldn't we call a doctor?

04:05.819 --> 04:07.031
I'll call the paramedics.

04:07.563 --> 04:09.120
Let's give her some room, people.

04:09.493 --> 04:10.797
In the kitchen, now!

04:21.889 --> 04:23.113
Oh, my God!

04:33.211 --> 04:34.249
Frank,

04:34.516 --> 04:35.753
what do we have here?

04:37.537 --> 04:38.748
Donny Lopez,

04:39.147 --> 04:40.745
Florida's star shortstop.

04:40.764 --> 04:43.053
Batted left, stabbed
his wife with his right.

04:43.825 --> 04:45.250
Court-sanctioned field trip.

04:45.503 --> 04:47.685
State Attorney wanted the jurors
to see the crime scene.

04:47.699 --> 04:50.053
Now they've seen two.
What about witness statements?

04:50.054 --> 04:51.732
So far, just a lot of confusion.

04:52.171 --> 04:53.928
Jury only had one more
week before deliberations.

04:54.181 --> 04:55.418
No need now.

04:55.618 --> 04:56.896
The verdict is in.

05:49.874 --> 05:51.245
Vic got hit from behind.

05:51.564 --> 05:52.661
Never saw it coming.

05:52.919 --> 05:54.102
The lights were out, Alexx,

05:54.137 --> 05:55.750
because they were recreating the Miranda

05:55.751 --> 05:57.379
Lopez murder for the jury.

05:57.414 --> 05:59.607
Made it easy for someone to sneak in,

05:59.698 --> 06:00.901
lie in wait.

06:01.967 --> 06:04.418
Patrol is canvassing the neighborhood.
See if anyone witnesed

06:04.419 --> 06:06.033
suspicious activity around the house.

06:06.036 --> 06:07.573
Sounds good.You take the kitchen.

06:07.574 --> 06:09.188
I'll take out front.Thank you,Alexx

06:12.706 --> 06:14.777
Knife missing from this block.
Could be our murder weapon.

06:15.420 --> 06:16.654
Nice work, Ryan.

06:16.669 --> 06:18.405
I think you may have cracked the case.

06:18.557 --> 06:19.715
Thanks. I...

06:19.806 --> 06:21.329
have a keen grasp of the obvious.

06:23.875 --> 06:26.159
Look, I know you and Tim Speedle were close.

06:26.205 --> 06:27.713
I know this was Speedle's case.

06:28.398 --> 06:29.966
I'm not trying to replace him.

06:30.134 --> 06:31.200
Good,

06:31.977 --> 06:33.423
'cause I don't need any new friends.

06:34.436 --> 06:36.020
All I want is to do a good job.

06:39.324 --> 06:40.345
Okay.

06:42.324 --> 06:43.573
Tell me what you see.

06:49.965 --> 06:51.960
You can touch him, Honey.
He's not gonna bite.

06:57.559 --> 06:59.021
Single blow to the head.

07:01.260 --> 07:03.605
No defensive wounds on his hands or arms.

07:04.793 --> 07:05.859
Means no struggle.

07:05.862 --> 07:07.248
Good. What else?

07:09.593 --> 07:12.075
We probably won't find
the victim's blood on our killer.

07:12.136 --> 07:13.247
And why is that?

07:13.248 --> 07:15.319
No liquid blood at the time of impact.

07:15.870 --> 07:17.164
No second hit.

07:17.165 --> 07:18.414
So no spatter.

07:18.779 --> 07:20.378
Well, look at you go.

07:25.085 --> 07:26.364
What do you see?

07:26.441 --> 07:27.644
Hair.

07:35.548 --> 07:38.548
Killer may have been short
in stature, well-groomed,

07:39.370 --> 07:40.604
possibly Persian.

07:41.673 --> 07:44.323
Although he may have had a hard time
lifting the cleaver with his paws.

07:44.897 --> 07:45.870
Cat hair?

07:45.871 --> 07:47.339
Even killers have pets.

07:49.986 --> 07:51.275
This is ridiculous.

07:51.755 --> 07:52.990
Now when can we go home?

07:53.140 --> 07:55.018
I'm afraid it's going to be a while,

07:55.019 --> 07:57.118
Mr. Tepper.You're all witnesses to a murder.

07:57.125 --> 07:58.920
It wasn't bad enough being locked up

07:58.921 --> 08:00.279
on this case for months.

08:00.375 --> 08:02.748
Stuck in a hotel, seeing
my kids on weekends.

08:03.557 --> 08:05.270
They wouldn't even let me
read the sports page, man.

08:05.271 --> 08:07.150
Just tell me what you saw in the house.

08:07.424 --> 08:08.480
There was lightning.

08:08.494 --> 08:09.907
Juror #7 had a seizure.

08:09.920 --> 08:11.484
People were yelling...
The next thing you know,

08:11.881 --> 08:13.829
Lopez was lying there,
knife stuck in his head.

08:14.556 --> 08:16.243
Poetic justice,if you ask me.

08:18.640 --> 08:19.859
Poetic justice?

08:19.860 --> 08:21.821
Did you see the pictures of the crime scene?

08:23.014 --> 08:24.756
What that animal did to his wife...

08:25.771 --> 08:26.978
He got what he deserved.

08:31.963 --> 08:33.280
We're never getting out of here.

08:38.306 --> 08:39.527
Find something?

08:41.405 --> 08:42.626
Actually...

08:44.368 --> 08:46.932
it's the absence of something
that's interesting.

08:46.967 --> 08:48.928
Paint's faded all around that frame.

08:49.133 --> 08:50.711
Means another picture was hanging here.

08:56.839 --> 08:58.374
And hanging here recently.

08:58.375 --> 09:00.130
Nobody has lived in this house

09:00.131 --> 09:01.035
for months.

09:01.036 --> 09:02.475
Do you think someone redressed the house?

09:02.476 --> 09:05.795
I think that I want to talk
to Mr. Lopez's attorney.

09:06.872 --> 09:08.600
All right,we dressed the house

09:08.750 --> 09:10.656
wedding pictures, family photos to enhance

09:10.657 --> 09:12.261
the jury's opinion of my client.

09:12.563 --> 09:15.278
Your client has been accused
of stabbing his wife.

09:15.285 --> 09:16.962
You left out knives?

09:16.972 --> 09:17.973
No.

09:18.631 --> 09:19.934
We hid 'em in a cabinet.

09:21.100 --> 09:22.114
Somebody put 'em back.

09:22.115 --> 09:23.952
So you may have a traitor on your team.

09:24.062 --> 09:25.008
No.

09:25.201 --> 09:26.326
Excuse me.

09:27.478 --> 09:27.888
Yeah.

09:27.889 --> 09:28.457
Horatio.

09:28.492 --> 09:29.575
Hey, what's wrong?

09:29.576 --> 09:30.796
I'm sorry to pull you away.

09:31.564 --> 09:32.826
It's Ray Jr.

09:32.922 --> 09:34.032
What's going on with Ray?

09:34.033 --> 09:36.186
My mom said he never came home after school.

09:36.392 --> 09:37.886
What does your mom have to do with this?

09:38.545 --> 09:39.874
She's watching Ray

09:39.875 --> 09:41.740
for this weekend while we're out of town.

09:45.943 --> 09:46.875
Yelina,

09:46.876 --> 09:49.632
tonight is a big night for kids.
I'm sure he's okay.

09:50.167 --> 09:52.128
He's been hanging out with
this new group of boys.

09:52.334 --> 09:53.801
One of them is 15.

09:54.343 --> 09:55.549
Uh, Christopher Owens.

09:55.550 --> 09:57.196
He just got his learner's license.

09:58.526 --> 09:59.623
He's trouble.

09:59.651 --> 10:01.612
I'll look into it.I'll call you back.
Hang in there.

10:20.205 --> 10:21.631
Give it up, Ray.

10:21.632 --> 10:22.866
My turn.

10:23.017 --> 10:24.717
Screw off, tool. It's my gun.

10:27.200 --> 10:29.380
How 'bout I just knock you
the hell out,

10:30.169 --> 10:31.403
take it myself?

10:36.327 --> 10:37.479
Ray?

10:41.607 --> 10:42.814
Oh, man.

10:45.324 --> 10:46.832
We weren't doing anything,Officer.

10:46.970 --> 10:48.230
Well, gentlemen,

10:48.231 --> 10:49.699
that's not quite true, is it?

10:49.829 --> 10:51.269
Why are you hassling us?

10:51.639 --> 10:53.696
You should be out giving
people speeding tickets.

10:53.724 --> 10:55.396
I'm going to let that pass, son.

10:55.397 --> 10:57.468
Which route do you drive home on?

10:58.318 --> 10:59.484
I'm not going home.

10:59.490 --> 11:01.301
You're all going home, so get in the car

11:01.849 --> 11:03.344
and take off right now.

11:05.703 --> 11:06.910
Not you, Ray.

11:08.165 --> 11:09.413
I know where you live

11:15.475 --> 11:16.489
So...

11:17.717 --> 11:19.363
what about some new friends for you?

11:20.186 --> 11:21.420
They're cool.

11:21.530 --> 11:23.188
They're not cool, Ray.
Chris is a vandal.

11:23.189 --> 11:25.850
He's had priors for disorderly conduct.

11:26.021 --> 11:27.351
Is that what you want?

11:27.955 --> 11:29.189
You want to be like Chris?

11:31.932 --> 11:33.468
We'll talk about it in the car. Come on.

11:35.943 --> 11:37.137
Come on.

12:10.878 --> 12:12.935
I heard you got a bloody
print from the cleaver?

12:13.237 --> 12:16.267
Yeah. No match to our jurors
or court personnel at the scene.

12:16.268 --> 12:18.119
I've been running it through the system.

12:18.592 --> 12:20.361
Still, a print in the victim's blood.

12:20.443 --> 12:22.391
Well, not exactly in the blood.

12:22.939 --> 12:24.366
Notice the ridge detail.

12:24.407 --> 12:25.682
What about it?

12:25.751 --> 12:28.302
Well, the blood goes around
the print, not through it.

12:31.590 --> 12:33.181
Means that the print was preexisting.

12:33.359 --> 12:34.621
It was there before the blood.

12:34.648 --> 12:36.239
Could still be from the killer.

12:36.267 --> 12:37.926
It's consistent with a single blow,

12:37.974 --> 12:40.168
but blood couldn't have
gotten onto the handle

12:40.169 --> 12:41.979
until after the initial hit.

12:47.650 --> 12:48.897
No match in AFIS.

12:48.898 --> 12:50.297
The print is not in the system.

12:50.763 --> 12:51.888
Okay.

12:51.943 --> 12:53.218
So we're back to square one.

12:53.301 --> 12:54.329
Not quite.

12:54.439 --> 12:55.742
There's one place I haven't looked yet.

12:56.146 --> 12:57.256
These are the ten cards

12:57.257 --> 12:58.587
from the Lopez household.

12:58.601 --> 13:00.576
Friends,family, employees

13:01.014 --> 13:03.593
people who were eliminated
for the murder of Mr. Lopez.

13:10.136 --> 13:11.438
You're not going to believe this.

13:11.822 --> 13:13.084
We've got a match?

13:13.619 --> 13:14.661
Yeah.

13:15.395 --> 13:16.835
Chelsea Lopez.

13:17.630 --> 13:18.837
Donny's daughter.

13:19.358 --> 13:21.114
I can't believe you think I did this.

13:21.594 --> 13:23.500
We found cat hair on your father's body.

13:23.569 --> 13:24.899
You have a Persian tabby.

13:25.328 --> 13:26.590
Mr. Whiskers.

13:27.221 --> 13:29.127
I was playing with him
before I went to see him.

13:30.101 --> 13:31.431
You saw your father yesterday?

13:32.350 --> 13:34.174
My grandparents make me see him once a week.

13:34.544 --> 13:35.490
Did you hug him?

13:35.497 --> 13:36.456
Yeah.

13:36.457 --> 13:37.732
I guess.

13:38.445 --> 13:39.419
Okay.

13:39.515 --> 13:41.504
We found your fingerprint
on the murder weapon.

13:41.655 --> 13:42.903
How do you explain that?

13:44.761 --> 13:47.037
Chelsea, I can't help you
unless you're honest with me.

13:48.271 --> 13:50.137
Did you sneak back into the house yesterday?

13:50.795 --> 13:51.796
Yes.

13:51.810 --> 13:52.893
Why?

13:53.689 --> 13:55.060
To move things around.

13:55.472 --> 13:56.487
I don't follow.

13:56.939 --> 13:58.913
Dad's lawyers put out the wedding pictures,

13:58.914 --> 14:00.135
the family albums.

14:00.574 --> 14:01.863
It was a bunch of lies.

14:01.918 --> 14:03.179
So you took them away?

14:03.214 --> 14:05.361
They were trying to make
him look like this family man.

14:06.752 --> 14:07.945
It wasn't like that.

14:09.248 --> 14:10.386
What was it like?

14:10.812 --> 14:11.744
Look.

14:11.765 --> 14:13.520
My dad had a lot of girlfriends.

14:13.726 --> 14:14.960
Tall model types.

14:15.372 --> 14:16.976
My mom was always crying.

14:17.360 --> 14:19.047
I hated what he did to her.

14:19.157 --> 14:20.487
What about the knives?

14:20.823 --> 14:22.330
I just wanted that jury to know what it was

14:22.331 --> 14:23.758
really like in our house.

14:24.114 --> 14:26.514
I mean, if they're going to
judge him for murdering Mom,

14:26.843 --> 14:28.174
they should have all the facts.

14:30.059 --> 14:31.065
Okay.

14:32.021 --> 14:34.393
Will you make me a list of everything
you moved in the house?

14:34.667 --> 14:35.765
Sure.

14:46.820 --> 14:47.725
Hey, uh,

14:47.739 --> 14:50.015
can I borrow a piece of paper?
I left mine outside.

14:53.919 --> 14:55.085
Thank you.

14:55.291 --> 14:56.853
Paper from the girl's binder doesn't match

14:56.854 --> 14:58.293
the killer's "Guilty" note.

14:58.294 --> 14:59.638
Different acid content.

15:00.550 --> 15:01.976
Paper looks similar, though.

15:02.251 --> 15:03.718
Looks can be deceiving.

15:03.752 --> 15:06.344
Both are 16-pound college-rule, but

15:06.797 --> 15:08.292
the similarity ends there.

15:08.676 --> 15:10.829
Each manufacturer's process is different,

15:10.993 --> 15:12.433
individual as DNA.

15:12.536 --> 15:14.195
What is that on the killer's note?

15:15.059 --> 15:17.020
Got some faint indentations there.

15:17.034 --> 15:18.995
I was just about to run it through ESDA.

15:42.744 --> 15:44.143
Wit saw

15:44.170 --> 15:45.885
ML through window.

15:47.613 --> 15:49.327
Wit" is "witness.

15:49.807 --> 15:51.521
ML" is "Miranda Lopez.

15:51.817 --> 15:53.517
Looks like someone was taking notes.

15:53.929 --> 15:56.548
Trial notes from the Miranda Lopez case...

15:57.069 --> 15:58.564
Our killer is a juror.

16:10.338 --> 16:11.900
So this is our dead defendant, Alexx.

16:11.901 --> 16:12.683
Yeah,

16:12.704 --> 16:14.720
Donny Lopez bagged and tagged. I dislodged

16:14.733 --> 16:16.090
the murder weapon from his skull.

16:16.091 --> 16:17.256
Turned it over to Eric.

16:17.257 --> 16:18.312
Okay, thank you.

16:18.313 --> 16:19.629
Who's that?

16:19.766 --> 16:21.426
ID'd as Martin Conner.

16:21.679 --> 16:22.625
Transient.

16:22.626 --> 16:24.119
Picked up at the Tamiami Canal.

16:24.120 --> 16:25.559
That's out by the airport, isn't it?

16:25.560 --> 16:26.492
Yeah.

16:26.493 --> 16:28.241
At first blush, the assistant ME

16:28.276 --> 16:29.990
thought he was covered in blood.

16:30.018 --> 16:31.458
Turns out it's red paint.

16:32.162 --> 16:33.822
Red paint, like from red-paint

16:33.835 --> 16:35.110
pellets, maybe.

16:35.111 --> 16:37.003
Like from one of those paint guns.

16:37.195 --> 16:38.745
What was the cause of death?

16:38.814 --> 16:40.500
He didn't go quietly,tell you that.

16:40.782 --> 16:43.291
Catecholamine levels in his
blood were off the chart.

16:43.771 --> 16:45.376
Adrenaline intoxication.

16:45.540 --> 16:48.036
Leading to what's called
contraction-band necrosis.

16:51.847 --> 16:54.535
Heart muscles contract so severely,
they rupture.

16:55.673 --> 16:57.964
Could be shock from a paint-gun hit

16:58.115 --> 16:59.472
caused a heart attack.

16:59.596 --> 17:00.816
Horatio,

17:00.878 --> 17:02.250
this man literally

17:02.332 --> 17:03.662
was scared to death.

17:11.075 --> 17:12.857
On Halloween,of all nights.

17:16.643 --> 17:17.917
You okay?

17:19.042 --> 17:20.387
I don't know yet.

17:24.021 --> 17:25.516
Juror #3.

17:25.517 --> 17:26.833
Jim Wilson.

17:27.039 --> 17:29.700
Architectural engineer from Homestead.

17:29.960 --> 17:31.812
Currently going through a divorce...

17:32.436 --> 17:34.219
and he trusts the police.

17:35.302 --> 17:36.741
Juror #4.

17:36.742 --> 17:38.373
Dara Williams.

17:38.374 --> 17:40.061
She's from Surfside.

17:40.349 --> 17:42.036
Two kids in junior high.

17:42.168 --> 17:43.690
Unsure about the death penalty.

17:44.143 --> 17:45.431
Okay. Um...

17:45.432 --> 17:47.613
Which one trusted the police?

17:47.805 --> 17:49.135
Wilson.

17:49.176 --> 17:51.197
Look, I am never gonna remember

17:51.232 --> 17:52.961
all of these names, so let's just do this.

17:53.830 --> 17:55.393
Juror #3

17:55.928 --> 17:57.368
is going to be the engineer...

17:58.548 --> 18:00.111
and Juror #4

18:00.605 --> 18:01.866
is going to be the soccer mom...

18:41.540 --> 18:42.926
Physical match,

18:43.022 --> 18:44.407
but whose notebook?

18:45.271 --> 18:46.958
Juror #11.

18:48.445 --> 18:49.762
The construction worker.

18:51.984 --> 18:53.300
You're kidding, right?

18:53.383 --> 18:54.699
'Fraid not, Carl.

18:55.097 --> 18:57.017
Killer's note came from your notebook.

18:57.600 --> 18:58.779
Care to explain that?

18:58.793 --> 19:01.015
Yeah. At least I was taking notes.

19:01.268 --> 19:03.270
You should've seen some
of those other bozos.

19:03.819 --> 19:04.875
So

19:04.888 --> 19:06.438
It's poetic justice.

19:06.465 --> 19:07.421
Right? That what you said.

19:07.456 --> 19:09.757
"Donny Lopez got what he deserved."

19:09.784 --> 19:11.127
With a little help from you.

19:11.162 --> 19:13.246
Look, we weren't allowed
to take the notebooks

19:13.247 --> 19:14.577
back to the hotel.

19:15.057 --> 19:16.648
We left them in the jury box.

19:16.826 --> 19:18.828
Anybody could've ripped a page outta mine.

19:19.308 --> 19:20.954
Okay. Well, let's find out.

19:22.555 --> 19:24.352
I'm going to give you a little test.

19:27.383 --> 19:29.522
W- What kind of test?

19:31.003 --> 19:32.170
Write your name down,

19:32.205 --> 19:33.604
in all lower-case letters.

19:42.237 --> 19:44.088
Construction worker didn't write that note.

19:44.952 --> 19:46.118
Are you sure?

19:46.153 --> 19:47.284
95% sure.

19:47.572 --> 19:50.219
Ran a conoscopic holography
on his exemplars.

19:50.856 --> 19:52.241
Translation, please?

19:52.666 --> 19:54.490
Take a look at the "T" in his last name.

19:55.834 --> 19:57.700
This hole is created on the cross stroke,

19:57.754 --> 19:59.756
pen tip falls into the furrow

19:59.757 --> 20:01.032
from the first stroke.

20:03.861 --> 20:05.616
You can see it better on the mirror view.

20:08.236 --> 20:10.128
That bump shows us directionality.

20:10.135 --> 20:13.001
Construction worker crosses
his "T"s backwards.

20:13.618 --> 20:14.714
Killer doesn't.

20:14.715 --> 20:17.102
So old angry Carl was telling the truth.

20:19.591 --> 20:20.894
Thanks.

20:28.053 --> 20:29.314
Gentlemen.

20:29.968 --> 20:31.346
Uncle Horatio, is my mom on her way over?

20:31.381 --> 20:33.430
Can you get me out? My dad's in a meeting.
He's busy until 2

20:33.465 --> 20:34.452
Here's what we're going to do.

20:34.487 --> 20:35.631
You're going to follow that officer.

20:35.666 --> 20:38.108
He's going to take your statements
and we'll go from there,

20:38.114 --> 20:39.293
all right?

20:39.294 --> 20:40.706
Go ahead. Follow him.

20:41.787 --> 20:42.802
Ray.

20:42.815 --> 20:44.201
You can stay right were you are.

20:48.932 --> 20:50.783
They won't tell us why we're here.

20:51.974 --> 20:53.104
Ray,

20:53.236 --> 20:55.715
I need to know what happened
last night with the paint gun.

20:56.714 --> 20:57.931
I don't know what you're talking about.

20:57.936 --> 20:58.990
Ray.

20:59.209 --> 21:00.932
What happened before I arrived?

21:01.656 --> 21:03.620
Nothing, just target practice.

21:05.659 --> 21:06.888
Ray.

21:07.250 --> 21:09.049
A man was killed last night.

21:09.291 --> 21:11.122
He was shot three times with red paint

21:11.123 --> 21:13.229
within a half mile of where you guys were.

21:13.552 --> 21:15.527
So don't tell me
it was target practice.

21:15.889 --> 21:17.206
What happened?

21:18.577 --> 21:19.680
He's dead?

21:19.715 --> 21:20.783
Mm-hmm.

21:23.345 --> 21:24.694
But it was Halloween.

21:25.144 --> 21:26.504
We were just messing around.

21:29.034 --> 21:29.998
Hey! You!

21:29.999 --> 21:31.238
What do you want?

21:31.239 --> 21:32.446
We want you to dance!

21:35.013 --> 21:36.264
Hey, come on.

21:41.547 --> 21:42.765
But...

21:42.874 --> 21:44.213
it was just a paint gun.

21:44.685 --> 21:45.936
Who shot him?

21:48.426 --> 21:49.633
We all did.

21:49.644 --> 21:52.628
Ray, a man lost his life.

21:53.455 --> 21:54.947
So tell me who shot him.

21:59.544 --> 22:00.861
We all did.

22:01.908 --> 22:03.148
Ray,

22:03.751 --> 22:05.134
here's what I want you to do.

22:05.244 --> 22:06.692
I don't want you to speak to anybody.

22:06.727 --> 22:08.140
Not a secretary.
Not an officer.

22:08.175 --> 22:09.237
Nobody.

22:09.286 --> 22:11.173
Until I tell you otherwise, you understand?

22:11.787 --> 22:12.753
Yes, sir.

22:12.771 --> 22:14.019
You sit tight, huh?

22:21.403 --> 22:23.660
Hi. I was just looking for you.

22:23.670 --> 22:24.625
What's up?

22:24.646 --> 22:25.990
More like, who's up?

22:26.011 --> 22:28.425
Juror #7, the cheerleader.

22:28.520 --> 22:29.821
The one who had the seizure?

22:29.841 --> 22:32.035
She spent the night at Miami General
for observation.

22:32.070 --> 22:34.154
She's being released this afternoon.

22:34.395 --> 22:36.636
Well, unfortunately,
that doesn't really help us,

22:36.671 --> 22:39.479
because she's the one juror we know
couldn't have killed Donny Lopez.

22:39.791 --> 22:43.927
She didn't kill him, but I think she
might've helped whoever did.

22:45.115 --> 22:47.928
Divalproex. 30 caplets.

22:47.949 --> 22:49.209
That's a full prescription.

22:49.230 --> 22:50.888
Filled a month ago.

22:50.941 --> 22:53.387
She hasn't been taking
her anti-seizure medication.

22:53.422 --> 22:54.555
But even without her meds,

22:54.590 --> 22:57.094
she'd have no way of knowing
exactly when she'd have a seizure.

22:57.516 --> 22:59.448
Unless she made it happen.

22:59.678 --> 23:04.097
Witnesses saw lightning flashes just
before the cheerleader hit the ground.

23:04.422 --> 23:05.745
What if it wasn't lightning?

23:05.766 --> 23:08.233
Epileptics can be photosensitive.

23:08.252 --> 23:09.817
They react to flashing lights.

23:16.409 --> 23:18.645
I really don't remember very much.

23:18.675 --> 23:20.291
It's a side effect of the seizures.

23:20.312 --> 23:23.587
You had the same side effect
the last couple times you had seizures.

23:23.598 --> 23:27.062
I know that because I read
the pleadings from all your lawsuits.

23:27.134 --> 23:31.574
Four seizures, four claims against
businesses and county offices.

23:31.910 --> 23:34.031
You're a bit of a scam artist,
aren't you, Ginger?

23:34.061 --> 23:37.871
Those were legitimate legal
problems with those facilities.

23:37.892 --> 23:39.813
Hey, that's a cool key chain.

23:40.254 --> 23:41.713
You mind if I take a look?

23:48.522 --> 23:49.845
That's a cute trick.

23:50.128 --> 23:51.944
You must be fun at parties.

23:51.953 --> 23:54.682
I think your legal problems
are just beginning.

23:55.554 --> 23:57.622
It was 5,000 bucks.

23:57.706 --> 23:59.658
All I had to do was have another seizure.

24:07.070 --> 24:09.189
She didn't say anything
about killing anybody.

24:09.224 --> 24:11.309
All I had to do was
get kicked off the jury...

24:11.384 --> 24:12.885
Get a mistrial.

24:13.284 --> 24:14.449
Who's "she"?

24:15.415 --> 24:16.570
Kelli.

24:17.007 --> 24:19.033
No last name.

24:19.054 --> 24:20.985
She just... gave a cell number.

24:21.227 --> 24:22.969
I don't know anything else.

24:27.542 --> 24:29.085
Here's what I think.

24:29.442 --> 24:32.098
You were the defense's
secret witness, Kelli.

24:32.317 --> 24:34.674
Donny Lopez liked tall model types,

24:34.709 --> 24:38.027
and I think that you were at his
house the night of the murder.

24:38.259 --> 24:39.354
weren't you?

24:40.568 --> 24:41.481
Yeah.

24:42.180 --> 24:46.001
And his attorneys were going
to have me testify to that.

24:46.106 --> 24:47.859
I just... I-I couldn't do it.

24:47.890 --> 24:51.018
So you paid a juror for a mistrial. Why?

24:51.291 --> 24:53.475
Me and Donny, that was fun.

24:53.569 --> 24:55.658
But I met a great new guy.

24:55.721 --> 24:57.149
He's a Flagler cousin.

24:57.212 --> 24:59.888
Old money, old family values.

25:00.407 --> 25:01.877
We're engaged.

25:02.517 --> 25:06.517
I just thought the quickest way to end
the trial would be to pay someone off.

25:06.538 --> 25:09.424
The quickest way to end the trial
is to kill the defendant.

25:09.445 --> 25:10.810
I didn't.

25:11.137 --> 25:12.828
I'm gonna need a sample of your handwriting

25:12.863 --> 25:15.931
to compare to the "Guilty" note
we found on Donny Lopez's body.

25:17.770 --> 25:18.631
Okay.

25:21.517 --> 25:22.756
Girlfriend's a bust.

25:22.767 --> 25:24.436
There's no match to the "Guilty" note.

25:24.457 --> 25:26.934
And the construction worker
didn't write the note, either.

25:26.964 --> 25:30.470
Cheerleader's a scam artist,
but not a murderer.

25:31.037 --> 25:32.391
So who's left?

25:33.346 --> 25:34.700
What about the dentist?

25:34.814 --> 25:37.354
Domestic violence allegation
in the past year.

25:37.407 --> 25:41.816
Mm, spousal abuser going postal
on jury duty...

25:41.837 --> 25:43.222
I don't think so.

25:43.242 --> 25:44.491
I like the chef.

25:44.575 --> 25:45.792
How do you figure?

25:45.824 --> 25:50.737
Works with knives.
That and... food service- very stressful.

25:52.399 --> 25:55.706
All right, let's go back to what we do know.

25:55.863 --> 25:59.432
Killer had to work quickly in the dark,
and he used an available weapon.

25:59.449 --> 26:01.003
It means they knew where it was located.

26:01.024 --> 26:03.186
Well, that jury knew where
everything was located.

26:03.197 --> 26:07.175
They had access to Speedle's crime
scene photographs, sketches, inventories...

26:07.184 --> 26:09.935
And they had four months to study them.

26:10.848 --> 26:12.947
Killer knew the house intimately.

26:13.567 --> 26:15.635
Or maybe he just thought he did.

26:16.107 --> 26:17.556
Things change.

26:17.950 --> 26:20.081
We've got to go back to the house.

26:29.545 --> 26:30.353
Lieutenant Caine?

26:30.363 --> 26:31.098
Mm-hmm?

26:31.602 --> 26:33.869
Rebecca Nevins, State Attorney's office.

26:34.478 --> 26:36.147
So, Raymond Caine Jr.

26:36.168 --> 26:37.858
Yes, he's my nephew.

26:37.910 --> 26:39.789
Your office really moved on this,
didn't they?

26:39.810 --> 26:41.227
It's the administration.

26:41.290 --> 26:43.694
Obviously with your brother's... past,

26:43.729 --> 26:46.518
no one would want to be perceived
as playing any special favors.

26:46.526 --> 26:50.830
Well, actually, I'm more concerned that
my nephew may be made an example.

26:50.840 --> 26:53.223
The other three boys gave
him up as the shooter.

26:53.241 --> 26:54.878
I guess that puts you in a funny position,

26:54.913 --> 26:57.316
and you're gonna take their word
or wait for the evidence, right?

26:57.723 --> 26:59.959
Exonerating evidence?
Didn't know you had any.

26:59.980 --> 27:02.646
Stick around. I'm full of surprises.

27:06.613 --> 27:07.379
Paula.

27:07.442 --> 27:08.460
Lieutenant Caine.

27:08.481 --> 27:11.473
The evidence from the paint gun case,
has it been logged yet?

27:11.514 --> 27:13.351
Yes, finished it just a few minutes ago.

27:13.372 --> 27:16.375
The weapon in question was found
in Chris Owens' vehicle...

27:16.396 --> 27:22.337
As well as a couple cartons of eggs, some
spray paint cans and a digital video camera.

27:23.580 --> 27:26.247
So maybe they taped their night out.

27:26.719 --> 27:29.858
Okay, get that over to AV for me,
please, would you?

27:29.879 --> 27:31.516
Yes, sir, right away.

27:38.072 --> 27:38.765
Nice!

27:40.571 --> 27:43.300
Want me to speed through
to anything in particular?

27:43.537 --> 27:44.776
Just play it.

27:46.854 --> 27:48.691
Hey, watch this.

27:53.517 --> 27:57.149
Sweet! Sweet!

28:07.452 --> 28:08.670
Guess that's it.

28:08.743 --> 28:11.987
Go back to the point where
we hear the first shot, okay?

28:21.680 --> 28:23.044
Do you hear that?

28:24.441 --> 28:27.243
That voice in the background.
There's a voice.

28:32.353 --> 28:36.352
Isolate the audio and separate the elements.
Let's do that. I want to hear that voice.

28:36.373 --> 28:38.472
Yeah, well, it's gonna take time.

28:58.682 --> 28:59.742
Stop it, Chris.

29:00.041 --> 29:02.098
About time. My dad out there?

29:02.109 --> 29:04.234
You are not going anywhere, my friend,

29:04.269 --> 29:08.013
because you are the subject
of a murder investigation.

29:08.322 --> 29:10.768
I told you, Ray's the one
who shot at that guy.

29:10.789 --> 29:12.605
Are you sure about that, Chris?

29:12.636 --> 29:15.366
Yeah, Michael and Dominic'll tell
you the same thing.

29:15.376 --> 29:16.625
No doubt they will.

29:16.656 --> 29:19.170
I need to let you know that anything
that you say to me now

29:19.205 --> 29:21.449
will affect the way you're
treated on these charges.

29:21.537 --> 29:25.337
I make the recommendation
to the State Attorney, Chris.

29:30.486 --> 29:32.113
Ray shot the guy.

29:32.144 --> 29:33.981
That's not true, Chris, is it?

29:34.012 --> 29:37.276
Ray... tried to stop it.

29:37.738 --> 29:41.265
Stop it, Chris!
That's not funny. Don't do it!

29:42.031 --> 29:43.407
You shot him.

29:43.424 --> 29:45.849
You shot the man, didn't you?

29:46.226 --> 29:47.906
Wha-What do you want?

29:47.917 --> 29:49.281
We want you to dance.

29:53.739 --> 29:56.310
Stop it, Chris.
That's not funny. Don't do it.

30:10.389 --> 30:14.189
Tell Ray... no hard feelings.

30:14.200 --> 30:18.063
You know what, Chris?
I think you should tell him yourself.

30:39.633 --> 30:41.218
What are we looking for?

30:41.627 --> 30:43.349
Anything that's different.

30:45.207 --> 30:46.708
That's different from what?

30:46.728 --> 30:49.562
Different from the night of
Miranda Lopez's murder.

30:51.651 --> 30:52.921
I'm not following.

30:52.951 --> 30:57.695
The killer on the jury memorized the layout
of the house from Speedle's sketches

30:57.706 --> 31:00.939
only he drew those sketches
from the original crime scene.

31:00.958 --> 31:02.564
Makes them almost a year old.

31:02.575 --> 31:03.792
Exactly.

31:04.139 --> 31:05.306
The house has been changed,

31:05.341 --> 31:08.140
but the sketches reflect
the conditions of a year ago.

31:08.494 --> 31:11.989
And if the killer didn't know that,
he might have made a mistake.

31:12.325 --> 31:14.603
This is the window, right,
that the neighbor saw through?

31:14.633 --> 31:18.528
Yeah. The state's case turned
on the neighbor's testimony.

31:18.548 --> 31:20.821
She said she saw Miranda Lopez
through the window

31:20.856 --> 31:22.385
about five minutes before the murder,

31:22.420 --> 31:24.857
but the defense argued that
her view was blocked.

31:31.807 --> 31:33.150
Blocked by what?

31:33.644 --> 31:34.987
Pocket door.

31:35.050 --> 31:36.520
But it was broken.

31:36.550 --> 31:38.219
Stuck in the wall over there.

31:40.812 --> 31:42.649
It's not broken anymore.

31:44.695 --> 31:49.671
Donny Lopez's attorneys not
only redecorated, they repaired.

31:49.902 --> 31:50.888
Well...

31:54.157 --> 31:56.592
Maybe they just did us a favor.

31:57.442 --> 31:59.374
Is that what I think it is?

31:59.405 --> 32:00.749
Face print.

32:09.416 --> 32:11.620
Sebaceous oils from the outer dermis.

32:11.651 --> 32:13.551
May give us skin cells.

32:13.614 --> 32:15.808
May give us the face of our killer.

32:39.630 --> 32:42.044
Juror #3, come on down.

32:42.296 --> 32:44.165
I don't understand.
I thought the trial was over.

32:44.185 --> 32:47.555
Donny Lopez's trial is over;
yours is just beginning.

32:47.924 --> 32:49.446
What are you talking about?

32:49.478 --> 32:50.771
We have DNA evidence

32:50.806 --> 32:53.862
that puts you in the kitchen last night
when Donny Lopez was murdered.

32:54.369 --> 32:56.584
I had to use the bathroom.

32:56.638 --> 32:59.683
I got lost looking for the group.
I ended up in the kitchen.

32:59.840 --> 33:01.194
Did you flush?

33:01.299 --> 33:02.107
What?

33:03.052 --> 33:03.944
Of course I did.

33:03.976 --> 33:05.729
Now, you see, that's a problem.

33:05.769 --> 33:07.767
Because the water in the house
has been turned off,

33:07.802 --> 33:10.250
and I checked the reservoir
tank on the toilet, it was full.

33:10.482 --> 33:12.519
If you'd flushed, it'd be empty.

33:12.540 --> 33:14.282
You didn't go to the bathroom.

33:14.344 --> 33:17.566
You stayed in the kitchen
and waited for your chance.

33:17.577 --> 33:21.891
Unfortunately, at the trial, you got
everything you needed to plan the murder.

33:21.911 --> 33:23.611
Crime scene photographs,

33:23.646 --> 33:25.311
diagrams of the house.

33:25.774 --> 33:27.527
Only your route was changed.

33:27.548 --> 33:30.603
You didn't realize that the pocket
door had been fixed.

33:41.305 --> 33:43.636
All I needed was an opportunity.

33:45.305 --> 33:48.202
I couldn't believe it when
that cheerleader bimbo went down.

33:48.223 --> 33:49.283
It was just too easy.

33:56.470 --> 33:59.451
Easy? To take a man's life?

33:59.470 --> 34:00.189
Hey...

34:00.224 --> 34:05.793
we put everything on hold, so this
guy can get, what, a million-dollar defense?

34:06.523 --> 34:09.399
His pro team just deferred his salary.

34:09.420 --> 34:11.246
What about our jobs, hmm?

34:11.268 --> 34:12.139
Our lives.

34:12.159 --> 34:15.592
Everyone on that jury was going
through the same hardship as you.

34:15.612 --> 34:19.350
Don't you lecture me about hardship.
I lost everything.

34:19.371 --> 34:21.271
My wife left me.

34:22.163 --> 34:24.063
She took my kids.

34:24.597 --> 34:28.123
I don't have a job to go back to.
My boss gave it to my fill-in.

34:28.523 --> 34:31.420
And there you were, Donny Lopez's mansion.

34:31.838 --> 34:35.018
Five bedrooms, wine cellar, plasma TV...

34:35.040 --> 34:37.675
Seven bedrooms, plasma TVs in each one.

34:39.291 --> 34:41.244
He wasn't gonna miss a beat.

34:41.277 --> 34:42.998
Unfortunately, you are.

34:44.563 --> 34:47.197
You're under arrest for aggravated murder.

35:02.189 --> 35:03.533
Oh, God.

35:03.554 --> 35:04.646
What's wrong?

35:04.845 --> 35:06.073
I don't think he did it.

35:06.089 --> 35:08.903
What are you talking about?
The guy just confessed. We got him.

35:08.952 --> 35:11.934
No, not him. Donny Lopez.
I don't think he killed his wife.

35:12.190 --> 35:13.846
Then who did?

35:25.660 --> 35:28.150
Hey, got your page.
What's going on?

35:28.161 --> 35:29.911
We need to talk about Miranda Lopez.

35:29.946 --> 35:31.449
What's left to talk about?

35:31.461 --> 35:32.881
Defendant's dead. Case is over.

35:32.905 --> 35:34.748
Our boss is holding a press
conference in a half an hour.

35:34.781 --> 35:37.294
You need to tell him not to.
Donny Lopez didn't kill her.

35:37.318 --> 35:38.621
You're telling me this now?

35:38.644 --> 35:41.805
Miranda Lopez had a single defensive
wound from a multiple stabbing.

35:41.840 --> 35:43.490
When was the last time you saw that?

35:44.126 --> 35:47.320
Everything your CSI presented
indicated it was the husband.

35:47.355 --> 35:48.498
Well, he testified on the evidence,

35:48.533 --> 35:50.805
but y'all made a determination
about who to charge.

35:51.054 --> 35:53.249
Terrific. You trying to get me sent
down to traffic court?

35:53.259 --> 35:56.347
No, I think it's more important that
we find the right killer, don't you, Bob?

35:56.382 --> 35:57.544
Of course.

35:57.944 --> 35:59.012
So who is it?

35:59.153 --> 36:01.126
Currently, we don't have a suspect.

36:01.490 --> 36:04.026
Do you know how bad that makes us look?

36:09.689 --> 36:11.474
Hey, Paula, is this all of them?

36:11.497 --> 36:13.834
Uh, two more boxes are coming from storage.

36:13.862 --> 36:18.101
Evidence, lab reports,
everything on Miranda Lopez.

36:19.675 --> 36:22.352
There's only one thing I'm looking for.

36:27.288 --> 36:29.166
Murder weapon.

36:29.354 --> 36:33.546
Alexx, will you walk me through
Miranda Lopez's injuries again?

36:34.530 --> 36:38.499
Sharp force wounds to the abdomen
and upper torso.

36:38.523 --> 36:40.481
Wound one was nonfatal,

36:40.516 --> 36:43.683
but two was penetrating
with right hemothorax.

36:43.851 --> 36:45.460
And how deep were the wounds?

36:45.472 --> 36:46.845
About two inches.

36:46.869 --> 36:49.264
Deep enough to nick the superior vena cava.

36:49.288 --> 36:50.779
She bled out.

36:50.791 --> 36:53.679
So the stab wounds were shallow.

36:54.476 --> 36:58.022
And these rips in the fabric,
they didn't penetrate the skin.

36:58.046 --> 37:00.547
Honey, vics don't stand still
while they're being stabbed.

37:00.558 --> 37:04.457
True, but if you take
these wounds in context...

37:04.507 --> 37:08.839
Hey, I deal in anatomical,
unless I'm invited into the lab.

37:08.863 --> 37:11.387
Well, consider yourself invited.

37:11.596 --> 37:13.483
You see, we never had any hard evidence

37:13.518 --> 37:16.213
that said that Donny Lopez
used the knife himself.

37:16.528 --> 37:18.571
It was just his actions afterward.

37:18.594 --> 37:20.813
But why'd he to clean up
if he didn't kill her?

37:20.835 --> 37:22.608
Well, it's human nature.

37:28.115 --> 37:31.121
- He just made things worse.
- Calleigh, where you going with all this?

37:31.146 --> 37:34.927
Did you know that Donny Lopez
hit 40 home runs last year?

37:34.950 --> 37:37.932
And he had the third highest slugging
percentage of anyone in the majors.

37:37.944 --> 37:38.801
So?

37:38.823 --> 37:42.838
So how does a guy as big and
as strong as that stab his wife,

37:42.873 --> 37:46.854
and only get two inches of
blood on the end of the blade?

37:46.969 --> 37:48.859
You're talking about a killer

37:50.151 --> 37:52.629
without a lot of upper torso strength.

37:54.202 --> 37:55.235
A woman.

37:55.482 --> 37:57.220
A woman with motive.

37:57.714 --> 37:59.183
And with long auburn hair.

37:59.218 --> 38:02.899
Like the one that Speedle found on
Donny Lopez the night of his wife's murder.

38:03.092 --> 38:05.840
I didn't kill Miranda.
I didn't even know her.

38:05.863 --> 38:07.190
But you knew her husband.

38:07.211 --> 38:10.334
You admitted to me that you were
at the house the night she was killed.

38:10.358 --> 38:12.495
I was with Donny.

38:13.011 --> 38:14.197
Doing what?

38:16.252 --> 38:17.614
Kelli.

38:19.103 --> 38:21.287
Donny wasn't very discreet.

38:21.345 --> 38:23.635
You were kissing him?

38:25.044 --> 38:26.993
You could call it a kiss.

38:32.037 --> 38:33.951
But you never went into the house.

38:33.975 --> 38:37.286
I have morals, okay?
His kids were inside.

38:39.310 --> 38:41.036
Yes, they were.

38:41.329 --> 38:43.290
Will you excuse me, please?

38:49.748 --> 38:52.965
Alexx, the wound on Miranda Lopez's hand...

38:52.989 --> 38:54.409
The defensive wound, yeah?

38:54.767 --> 38:56.200
What if it wasn't defensive?

38:56.223 --> 38:59.358
If her hand were upraised,
wouldn't you expect a puncture?

38:59.627 --> 39:03.309
Every knife would on a stabbing
victim's hand is considered defensive.

39:03.344 --> 39:04.251
That's protocol.

39:05.369 --> 39:07.283
Unless the hand were down here.

39:07.376 --> 39:10.089
That means the killer was
someone she trusted.

39:10.173 --> 39:12.510
Someone she wasn't afraid of.

39:17.418 --> 39:19.367
Tell me about the night
your mother was killed.

39:19.379 --> 39:21.375
I already told the police everything.

39:21.596 --> 39:23.052
Except the truth.

39:24.273 --> 39:26.363
I was asleep in my room.

39:27.196 --> 39:28.817
I don't think so.

39:29.251 --> 39:32.386
I think you got into a fight
with your mom, didn't you?

39:33.261 --> 39:36.349
I saw him that night.

39:36.666 --> 39:38.275
In some girl's car.

39:38.334 --> 39:39.637
It was disgusting.

39:47.237 --> 39:49.644
Tried to tell my mom,
but she wouldn't listen.

39:49.715 --> 39:51.452
She got so angry.

39:51.464 --> 39:53.448
Don't you lie to me, Chelsea?!

39:53.490 --> 39:57.294
I'm not lying!
I saw Dad out there with some woman!

39:57.329 --> 39:59.431
It's your fault that he has to do that.

40:01.439 --> 40:02.824
I was afraid of her.

40:02.848 --> 40:04.222
Afraid of what she might do.

40:04.258 --> 40:07.111
I don't believe you!
I don't believe a word that you're saying!

40:07.123 --> 40:09.635
I can't take this anymore.
I don't trust you.

40:09.647 --> 40:10.657
You never believe me!

40:10.669 --> 40:13.146
You're making it up.
I don't know why you keep doing this.

40:13.170 --> 40:15.048
- I'm not making it up.
- You are.

40:16.052 --> 40:19.492
See, Chelsea, that's not what
the evidence is telling me.

40:29.252 --> 40:31.119
She had her hand open.

40:32.152 --> 40:34.242
She was reaching out to you.

40:40.183 --> 40:42.284
Why don't you listen to me?!

40:42.296 --> 40:44.703
Chelsea, give me the knife now.

40:44.727 --> 40:47.627
No! Honey, give it to Mom.

40:47.636 --> 40:51.616
Whatever it is, whatever's bothering you,
we can talk about it.

40:51.628 --> 40:53.084
Just give me the knife.

40:53.095 --> 40:54.962
Please, honey, just give it to me.

41:10.334 --> 41:14.126
She trusted you, and you killed her.

41:15.465 --> 41:17.907
I just wanted them to be happy.

41:20.632 --> 41:24.976
Be together, like they were
in the magazines.

41:26.350 --> 41:27.594
I'm sorry.

41:31.263 --> 41:35.584
I miss her. I miss her every day.

41:53.592 --> 41:55.388
I feel bad for that man.

41:55.670 --> 41:58.065
I can't stop picturing the look on his face.

41:58.101 --> 42:02.680
Well, his name is Martin Conner,
and I don't want you to stop picturing it.

42:02.774 --> 42:04.218
You understand why?

42:04.791 --> 42:06.035
I think so.

42:07.209 --> 42:08.454
Okay.

42:08.982 --> 42:11.061
Your mom will be here any minute.

42:11.742 --> 42:13.151
With Stetler.

42:15.146 --> 42:17.189
You never come around anymore.

42:18.609 --> 42:20.512
Well, buddy, um...

42:21.991 --> 42:24.727
I guess I'm just trying to give
your mom some space.

42:24.748 --> 42:26.627
She doesn't need space.

42:27.672 --> 42:30.020
You know what we need, you and me?

42:30.044 --> 42:32.298
We need a fishing trip.

42:32.803 --> 42:34.153
- Really?
- Yeah.

42:34.177 --> 42:35.492
Yeah, definitely.

42:39.222 --> 42:40.643
Excuse me a minute.

42:42.736 --> 42:44.169
Hey, buddy.

42:44.181 --> 42:45.284
Thank you.

42:46.083 --> 42:46.999
Anytime.

42:47.010 --> 42:48.666
You know, we should get home.

42:49.981 --> 42:50.721
Okay.

42:52.881 --> 42:54.466
Thanks for stepping in, Horatio.

42:54.478 --> 42:56.603
Well, he's my nephew, Rick.

42:59.046 --> 43:00.044
Saturday, buddy?

43:00.056 --> 43:02.099
- We're on, Uncle Horatio.
- Okay, pal.
