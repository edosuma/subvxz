WEBVTT

00:05.440 --> 00:06.680
Supper time!

00:06.720 --> 00:07.800
Those leaves and twigs
that you boiled up this morning?

00:07.840 --> 00:09.720
It's called Bramble-Beard Soup.

00:09.760 --> 00:11.080
Have you noticed

00:11.120 --> 00:13.320
that I am not able to walk
for more than 50 paces

00:13.360 --> 00:14.840
without stopping
for a crap?

00:14.880 --> 00:16.280
It's an acquired taste.

00:16.320 --> 00:17.480
You'll get used to it.

00:17.520 --> 00:19.960
You made a deal with my enemy.

00:20.000 --> 00:23.200
Antedia's army is standing by
if this doesn't work out,

00:23.240 --> 00:24.400
and you want me
to trust you?

00:26.320 --> 00:28.920
Do you want to bed her
before she dies?

00:28.960 --> 00:31.920
Here's some advice...
keep an eye on your husband.

00:31.960 --> 00:34.160
Send word to the Regni.

00:34.200 --> 00:36.600
They can start their siege.

00:36.640 --> 00:37.640
Do you trust him?

00:37.680 --> 00:39.120
Not as far as I
could shit him.

00:39.160 --> 00:41.880
I think I know
why the Romans came.

00:41.920 --> 00:45.720
Lokka, the Great Earth Demon,
has come to destroy you.

00:45.760 --> 00:47.240
Seize them!

00:47.280 --> 00:48.160
Guards!

00:48.200 --> 00:49.320
Protect the Queen!

00:49.360 --> 00:50.560
You have made a big mistake
here today.

00:52.120 --> 00:55.160
Together,
we must destroy Lokka.

00:55.200 --> 00:56.400
Together?

00:56.440 --> 00:59.680
They are singing
your name, sister.

00:59.720 --> 01:02.320
The dead are singing
your name!

01:02.360 --> 01:03.280
It turns out

01:03.320 --> 01:05.880
you're not a
pointless, annoying,

01:05.920 --> 01:07.400
interfering little
pain in the ass.

01:08.760 --> 01:10.240
Thank you.

01:21.360 --> 01:22.360
You saw Islene?

01:24.480 --> 01:26.120
Answer me, lass.

01:27.760 --> 01:28.640
Yes.

01:28.680 --> 01:29.720
She told you something...

01:29.760 --> 01:32.240
about the Underworld...
about you.

01:32.280 --> 01:33.560
Yes.

01:34.880 --> 01:36.320
That man out there...

01:36.360 --> 01:38.000
he said there's a prophecy.

01:38.040 --> 01:39.000
It's what's written.
It's...

01:39.040 --> 01:40.040
Destiny.

01:40.080 --> 01:42.240
He explained it to me too.

01:42.280 --> 01:44.400
Do you believe him?

01:44.440 --> 01:47.480
I don't know
what to believe.

01:47.520 --> 01:49.680
If it was Islene,
if that's who you saw,

01:49.720 --> 01:50.680
then it's true.

01:50.720 --> 01:52.760
That's what I'm afraid of.

01:55.040 --> 01:56.720
You've a journey to go on, lass,

01:56.760 --> 01:57.720
a very important journey.

01:57.760 --> 02:00.040
Your friend out there...

02:00.080 --> 02:01.280
he's going
to take care of you.

02:01.320 --> 02:02.560
What do you mean?

02:02.600 --> 02:05.560
What's he been saying?
Wait, what about you?

02:05.600 --> 02:07.000
Cait...where you're going,
there's great danger.

02:07.040 --> 02:08.199
No.

02:08.240 --> 02:09.520
You don't need a blind man
slowing you down.

02:09.560 --> 02:10.919
No. Absolutely not.

02:10.960 --> 02:11.840
Cait...

02:11.880 --> 02:13.040
You said I'm in charge.

02:13.080 --> 02:14.040
Well, I'm not leaving you,
and that's that.

02:14.080 --> 02:15.440
You are in charge.

02:15.480 --> 02:17.360
You saved my life.
I trust you to do what's right.

02:17.400 --> 02:18.360
I can't do it.

02:18.400 --> 02:20.000
I can't lose you again.

02:20.040 --> 02:21.000
Come here.

02:21.040 --> 02:22.760
You're just going
on a journey.

02:22.800 --> 02:24.240
All right?
That's what children do.

02:24.280 --> 02:25.640
They grow up,
they go on their way,

02:25.680 --> 02:26.760
and then they come back

02:26.800 --> 02:28.960
and tell their old dad
all about it.

02:29.000 --> 02:30.520
Now,
it may not be in this world,

02:30.560 --> 02:32.600
but I know
I'll see you again.

02:32.640 --> 02:34.360
Your sister too.
We'll all be together.

02:34.400 --> 02:35.640
Where will you go?

02:35.680 --> 02:37.000
Don't worry about me.

02:37.040 --> 02:39.000
I'm not ready.

02:39.040 --> 02:40.880
They're calling for you, Cait.

02:40.920 --> 02:42.280
You know what you have to do...

02:42.320 --> 02:43.400
for me...

02:43.440 --> 02:46.080
for Islene...
for us all.

02:50.080 --> 02:51.640
Put me on the Southern Road.

02:51.680 --> 02:53.120
I know that path
like the back of my hand.

02:53.160 --> 02:55.280
How will you manage?

03:05.400 --> 03:07.400
Don't worry about me.

03:17.320 --> 03:19.160
You better have this right,
Outcast,

03:19.200 --> 03:21.760
or I will find you,
eyes or no eyes.

03:21.800 --> 03:23.080
Before you know it,

03:23.120 --> 03:24.480
you'll be searching
'round the floor for yours.

03:24.520 --> 03:25.480
Clear?

03:25.520 --> 03:27.680
Crystal.

03:52.600 --> 03:54.040
He's doomed.

03:54.080 --> 03:55.480
What?

05:34.440 --> 05:35.440
Are you not cold, Mother?

05:35.480 --> 05:38.400
Thank you,
my darling boy.

05:41.040 --> 05:44.120
My burning need for vengeance
keeps me toasty.

05:48.160 --> 05:49.320
It's been four moons.

05:49.360 --> 05:51.480
Perhaps we should parley.

05:51.520 --> 05:53.600
Parley my balls.

05:55.560 --> 05:58.200
This is just getting
interesting.

06:00.680 --> 06:03.240
The meat is finished.

06:03.280 --> 06:06.040
The hogs, hens, cattle...

06:06.080 --> 06:07.440
even the horses.

06:07.480 --> 06:09.240
How much wheat do we have left
in the store?

06:09.280 --> 06:10.360
Two moons' worth.

06:10.400 --> 06:11.320
Then we eat bread.

06:11.360 --> 06:12.240
For two moons.

06:12.280 --> 06:13.440
Then porridge.

06:13.480 --> 06:14.440
For three moons.
Then what?

06:14.480 --> 06:16.040
Three winter moons.

06:16.080 --> 06:17.120
When winter bites,

06:17.160 --> 06:18.920
we'll see
how she likes it out there.

06:18.960 --> 06:22.160
We'll see whose
will is stronger.

07:22.240 --> 07:26.080
You must be wondering
why I summoned you all here.

07:26.120 --> 07:27.440
This is Ashur Ram
and his brother, Aziz,

07:27.480 --> 07:29.000
from the plains
of Assyria.

07:29.040 --> 07:30.440
I know Ashur Ram.

07:30.480 --> 07:32.960
Our paths
have crossed many times...

07:33.000 --> 07:35.400
and who has not heard
of Hella, The Irish Raven,

07:35.440 --> 07:38.000
Slayer of Pharaohs.

07:38.040 --> 07:39.400
Her deeds are fabled
in all the four corners...

07:39.440 --> 07:41.800
I've no idea who you are.
Them neither.

07:41.840 --> 07:43.280
Where's the gold?

07:43.320 --> 07:46.680
Your messenger said
a hundred solidus, up front.

07:46.720 --> 07:48.920
Don't you want
to know your task first?

07:48.960 --> 07:50.200
First I want
to see the gold.

07:50.240 --> 07:51.600
Who is it
you seek, General?

07:53.200 --> 07:55.080
One of the Cantii.
A young girl.

07:55.120 --> 07:56.920
She left the Citadel
four months ago

07:56.960 --> 07:58.560
with her blind father.

07:58.600 --> 08:00.200
A small girl
and a blind father?

08:02.040 --> 08:03.480
This is the prophecy
of the Druids.

08:03.520 --> 08:05.800
It's the girl I want.

08:07.320 --> 08:09.680
Whoever brings me
her head, that man...

08:09.720 --> 08:11.640
or woman...

08:11.680 --> 08:12.760
shall have ten times
this amount.

08:15.800 --> 08:17.800
Now, you are all criminals...

08:17.840 --> 08:20.920
some under sentence of execution
from the Senate itself,

08:20.960 --> 08:23.040
but whoever does this

08:23.080 --> 08:24.920
will have the protection
of the Emperor...

08:26.400 --> 08:27.680
Fuck.

08:27.720 --> 08:30.520
Throughout the Empire,
in perpetuity.

08:39.400 --> 08:40.360
What's that?

08:40.400 --> 08:42.240
A crossbow.

08:42.280 --> 08:43.440
How much?

08:43.480 --> 08:44.680
It's not for sale.

08:48.400 --> 08:49.440
I haven't got all day.

08:54.880 --> 08:56.240
Be warned.

08:57.560 --> 08:58.800
It's powerful.

09:08.600 --> 09:11.000
I am Jhehutamisu
Akbolla Ramses.

09:11.040 --> 09:14.040
My poisons work
fast and slow.

09:14.080 --> 09:15.960
It's the slow ones
you should fear.

09:34.160 --> 09:35.040
The Siege at Crugdunon,

09:35.080 --> 09:37.680
Day 131.

09:37.720 --> 09:39.920
The snows have not yet fallen.

09:39.960 --> 09:42.920
The pact with Queen Antedia
holds strong,

09:42.960 --> 09:45.160
and the Twentieth
Valeria Victrix Legion

09:45.200 --> 09:46.440
are on their way
from Rutupiae...

09:46.480 --> 09:49.240
So...
you speak for the Emperor now.

09:50.960 --> 09:52.000
And you listen at doorways.

09:58.960 --> 10:00.320
Let's get
one thing straight.

10:00.360 --> 10:02.920
It was me
blinded that bastard.

10:02.960 --> 10:04.960
No one asked me to.

10:05.000 --> 10:06.320
No djinni appeared.

10:06.360 --> 10:09.560
No centaur galloped up
and whispered in my ear.

10:09.600 --> 10:11.440
I just felt like it.

10:11.480 --> 10:12.800
Now, are you telling me
that I did that

10:12.840 --> 10:15.720
because I was supposed
to do it?

10:15.760 --> 10:17.920
So no one made you do it.

10:17.960 --> 10:18.920
Correct.

10:18.960 --> 10:19.920
You just thought you would.

10:19.960 --> 10:21.000
Correct.

10:21.040 --> 10:22.080
You punished
prisoners before.

10:22.120 --> 10:23.160
Dozens.

10:23.200 --> 10:24.600
Ever blinded any?

10:24.640 --> 10:25.840
My first time.

10:25.880 --> 10:27.960
What did you see that
you didn't like so much?

10:28.000 --> 10:29.520
He was a cunt.

10:29.560 --> 10:31.040
You'd have done
exactly the same.

10:31.080 --> 10:32.640
I wasn't there.
You were.

10:32.680 --> 10:33.960
I could have cut
his tongue out.

10:35.680 --> 10:36.640
But you didn't.

10:36.680 --> 10:37.640
But I could have.

10:37.680 --> 10:38.640
But you didn't.

10:38.680 --> 10:39.800
But I could have!

10:40.920 --> 10:43.000
But you didn't.

10:44.160 --> 10:45.080
Fuck this.

10:45.120 --> 10:47.040
I'm going to go
take a dump.

10:48.280 --> 10:50.880
Now, I'm fairly certain
that's my idea,

10:50.920 --> 10:54.360
but just in case
it's in some fucking prophecy,

10:54.400 --> 10:56.920
does it say how often
I should wipe my arse?

10:56.960 --> 10:58.960
You're not working
for the Emperor.

11:00.960 --> 11:03.360
So who the fuck
are you working for?

11:49.040 --> 11:50.040
Knock knock.

11:56.520 --> 11:58.960
Everything all right?

11:59.000 --> 12:01.120
Fine.

12:01.160 --> 12:02.160
Well, chop-chop.

12:03.520 --> 12:05.760
Time to go and visit
the old bat.

12:57.120 --> 12:58.440
Leave us.

12:58.480 --> 13:01.160
So this is all we have,
all that's left.

13:01.200 --> 13:02.200
This is it.

13:02.240 --> 13:04.200
It'll buy us some time.

13:04.240 --> 13:05.320
To do what?

13:05.360 --> 13:06.840
Since the day
the Romans landed,

13:06.880 --> 13:08.560
this fortress was doomed.

13:08.600 --> 13:10.360
I knew it.

13:10.400 --> 13:12.080
I believe even
your father knew it.

13:14.840 --> 13:17.160
Do you ever wonder
if we should have fled?

13:17.200 --> 13:19.280
Just you and I?

13:20.800 --> 13:22.400
Every day...

13:25.280 --> 13:29.160
but then I look at those faces
out there in the courtyard...

13:29.200 --> 13:30.600
those hungry children's faces.

13:30.640 --> 13:32.760
You have no choice.

13:32.800 --> 13:33.880
Surrender to the Romans.

13:33.920 --> 13:35.440
Pay their taxes.

13:35.480 --> 13:36.280
I'm afraid
it's too late for that.

13:36.320 --> 13:37.680
It's not too late.

13:37.720 --> 13:39.200
Their general, Aulus...
he'll never trust me again.

13:39.240 --> 13:40.160
Why?

13:40.200 --> 13:41.160
Because I know who he is.

13:41.200 --> 13:44.040
I know what he is...

13:44.080 --> 13:45.480
and I know
what he wants.

13:45.520 --> 13:46.640
What do you mean?

13:46.680 --> 13:49.680
He came here talking taxes...

13:49.720 --> 13:51.880
but he was looking
for something else.

13:51.920 --> 13:54.240
Give up the fortress.
The people will be spared.

13:54.280 --> 13:58.880
We both know Antedia
will not spare a single soul.

13:58.920 --> 14:00.360
She will kill me last

14:00.400 --> 14:03.720
and make me watch
every one of them die.

14:05.360 --> 14:07.240
Mmm, smell that.

14:07.280 --> 14:08.480
Doesn't it smell wonderful?

14:08.520 --> 14:11.640
A few more weeks,
they'll be clean out of corn.

14:11.680 --> 14:12.960
They'll have
to eat their dogs,

14:13.000 --> 14:15.280
then their belts.

14:15.320 --> 14:16.760
Then it's the old shoe soup.

14:16.800 --> 14:20.640
Before long, they'll be
eyeing up their kids for cuts.

14:20.680 --> 14:22.720
Then, my son, we'll parley.

14:22.760 --> 14:25.160
Ah...

14:25.200 --> 14:27.040
Welcome.
Just in time for breakfast.

14:28.160 --> 14:30.600
Where's this legion
you promised me?

14:30.640 --> 14:34.000
The Twentieth Valeria Victrix
are on their way from Rutupiae.

14:34.040 --> 14:35.520
Their dispatch riders liaised
with ours two days ago.

14:35.560 --> 14:36.840
Two days?

14:36.880 --> 14:38.200
We could move
a thousand men here

14:38.240 --> 14:41.320
from Noviomagus Reginorum
in half that time.

14:41.360 --> 14:42.480
If I had any idea
where that was,

14:42.520 --> 14:43.880
I'm sure I'd be impressed.

14:43.920 --> 14:46.960
Now, this spy of yours,
the one at the fortress...

14:47.000 --> 14:48.280
I think
it's time we used him.

14:48.320 --> 14:50.160
I'll pick my moment.

14:50.200 --> 14:51.520
Well,
maybe we can pick it together.

14:51.560 --> 14:52.600
Are you doubting
my strategy?

14:52.640 --> 14:54.080
I've been laying sieges

14:54.120 --> 14:56.320
back when your father
still fancied your mother.

14:56.360 --> 14:58.080
I think it's time.

15:01.960 --> 15:03.880
Gildas.

15:03.920 --> 15:06.840
Send this to our
friend at the citadel.

15:13.520 --> 15:14.480
What's wrong
with your bum chum?

15:14.520 --> 15:15.720
Oh...

15:15.760 --> 15:17.240
he's lost his appetite.

15:17.280 --> 15:19.040
What's wrong, pretty boy?

15:19.080 --> 15:21.640
Don't you like
my cooking?

15:21.680 --> 15:24.600
The Queen asked you a question.

15:28.800 --> 15:29.600
I'm not hungry.

15:29.640 --> 15:31.040
Not hungry?

15:31.080 --> 15:33.160
Do you hear that, Kerra?

15:33.200 --> 15:35.040
Our friend here
isn't even hungry...

15:35.080 --> 15:36.360
and to think,

15:36.400 --> 15:37.760
someone would give
their right arm

15:37.800 --> 15:39.520
for a plate like that.

15:40.680 --> 15:43.120
Now, eat my eggs...

15:43.160 --> 15:44.400
or I'll get angry.

16:51.600 --> 16:53.400
What?

16:53.440 --> 16:54.680
What?

16:54.720 --> 16:58.040
You just said
you've been thinking.

17:00.520 --> 17:02.920
I've been thinking...

17:02.960 --> 17:04.640
that we should maybe...

17:04.680 --> 17:07.760
Stay in.

17:07.800 --> 17:09.839
Exactly.

17:26.280 --> 17:27.960
Hello there.

17:28.000 --> 17:29.080
Hello, friend.

17:29.120 --> 17:30.760
Come in.

17:37.080 --> 17:38.320
Where is the girl?

17:43.320 --> 17:44.520
Hello.

17:47.600 --> 17:49.200
What do you want?

17:49.240 --> 17:50.480
I'm hungry.

17:50.520 --> 17:53.000
I wondered if you
could spare some food.

17:53.040 --> 17:54.400
Here, girlie.

17:54.440 --> 17:55.600
We'll give you some food.

17:55.640 --> 17:57.880
Why don't you come and
sit down next to me?

18:00.760 --> 18:01.880
Yeah.

18:01.920 --> 18:03.640
We'll give you some.
Don't be scared.

18:03.680 --> 18:05.960
Why don't you come
and sit on my knee?

18:06.000 --> 18:08.240
Thank you.
That's very kind.

18:12.240 --> 18:13.120
Hold on.

18:13.160 --> 18:14.520
What's this?

18:14.560 --> 18:15.520
What is it?

18:15.560 --> 18:16.840
It's pretty,
isn't it?

18:16.880 --> 18:18.480
It's lovely.

18:18.520 --> 18:20.280
Keep looking at it...

18:20.320 --> 18:21.800
at the centre.

18:21.840 --> 18:23.680
Are you looking
at the centre?

18:26.400 --> 18:27.200
Good.

18:28.480 --> 18:31.680
Now...as...the breeze blows...
across...

18:31.720 --> 18:34.960
As the breeze
blows across your face,

18:35.000 --> 18:36.240
you feel sleepy...

18:36.280 --> 18:39.960
As the cold wind blows
across your face...

18:41.680 --> 18:43.720
As the cold wind
blows across...

18:43.760 --> 18:45.360
uh...

18:45.400 --> 18:47.480
Now, as the breeze...

18:48.480 --> 18:51.360
Across your face...

18:54.600 --> 18:56.680
As the breeze
blows across your face,

18:56.720 --> 18:57.720
you feel sleepy!

19:00.440 --> 19:01.960
After 'em!

19:02.000 --> 19:04.240
After 'em!
After them!

19:12.840 --> 19:13.840
Where's she gone?

19:19.600 --> 19:21.480
"As the breeze blows
across your face,

19:21.520 --> 19:22.640
you feel sleepy.

19:22.680 --> 19:24.000
Your eyelids get heavy,

19:24.040 --> 19:27.080
and you drift into the peace
and sanctuary of sleep."

19:27.120 --> 19:28.360
I was nervous.

19:28.400 --> 19:29.760
Cold wind?

19:29.800 --> 19:31.240
It's fucking cold.

19:31.280 --> 19:33.160
I don't fucking care
how cold it is.

19:33.200 --> 19:35.000
It's supposed
to be dreamy!

19:36.480 --> 19:37.600
You fucked up.

19:37.640 --> 19:38.880
Nearly got us killed.

19:38.920 --> 19:40.360
I'm trying,
all right?

19:40.400 --> 19:41.920
Well,
try fucking harder.

19:41.960 --> 19:44.600
You couldn't charm
a fucking cat.

19:44.640 --> 19:45.840
Unbelievable.

19:46.840 --> 19:48.440
We have to move.

19:48.480 --> 19:50.400
Those soldiers are
looking for us now.

19:50.440 --> 19:51.440
Prime spot.

19:51.480 --> 19:53.360
River, rabbits
all over... but no!

19:53.400 --> 19:55.240
Let's move! Let's move
because you can't even...

19:55.280 --> 19:56.520
It's hard.

19:56.560 --> 19:57.800
When I was still
a child,

19:57.840 --> 20:01.560
I could charm a village
with a fucking stick.

20:01.600 --> 20:02.840
Just fuck off, would you?

20:02.880 --> 20:04.400
Four moons,

20:04.440 --> 20:06.640
and you don't know
what the birds are doing,

20:06.680 --> 20:08.640
what the winds mean.

20:12.000 --> 20:12.960
You're useless.

20:13.000 --> 20:16.400
It's like trying
to teach a tree.

20:25.440 --> 20:28.040
This is the last time
that I ask.

20:28.080 --> 20:29.720
Where is the girl?

20:29.760 --> 20:31.200
Wait! Wait...

20:31.240 --> 20:34.160
Way back...

20:34.200 --> 20:35.720
I saw a blind man and a girl.

20:35.760 --> 20:37.000
When?

20:37.040 --> 20:39.640
Well, that is...
that's tricky,

20:39.680 --> 20:40.880
'cause
time has gotten a bit weird.

20:41.920 --> 20:43.400
Where was she?

20:43.440 --> 20:44.640
Outside, at the
crossroads out of the village.

20:46.160 --> 20:47.680
She went north.
He went south.

20:47.720 --> 20:50.040
With another man.
That's all I know!

20:54.560 --> 20:55.640
Wait! Wait!

21:00.280 --> 21:02.200
You're right.
That is powerful.

21:02.240 --> 21:04.280
Was worth every penny.

21:07.200 --> 21:09.080
Thanks for humping my gold
all this way and all.

21:09.120 --> 21:10.000
I appreciate it.

21:14.800 --> 21:16.080
Where are the crossroads?

21:26.000 --> 21:27.120
This prophecy...

21:27.160 --> 21:29.240
it mentions a small daughter...

21:29.280 --> 21:30.240
And a blind father.

21:30.280 --> 21:31.240
What's your point?

21:31.280 --> 21:32.680
So what about
me and my dad...

21:32.720 --> 21:33.880
What do you mean?

21:36.720 --> 21:38.080
Oh, I see where this is going.

21:38.120 --> 21:39.080
Do you?

21:39.120 --> 21:40.400
Because I think
everyone can.

21:40.440 --> 21:42.080
For a start,

21:42.120 --> 21:43.640
he wasn't blind
to start with.

21:43.680 --> 21:45.720
Blind father.
Small daughter.

21:45.760 --> 21:48.520
Who knows?
Perhaps you're the blind man.

21:48.560 --> 21:50.440
Let me tell you something else
the prophecy says.

21:50.480 --> 21:51.400
You want to know
what happens next?

21:51.440 --> 21:52.320
I'll tell you.

21:52.360 --> 21:53.760
Lokka, in his rage,

21:53.800 --> 21:58.360
releases three hellhounds
to track down the Chosen One.

21:58.400 --> 21:59.480
There.

21:59.520 --> 22:01.520
How do you like that?

22:05.280 --> 22:06.320
Hellhounds?

22:06.360 --> 22:07.640
Hellhounds.

22:07.680 --> 22:08.640
What's a hellhound?

22:08.680 --> 22:10.120
I'll tell you
what it isn't.

22:10.160 --> 22:12.000
It's not a good thing.

22:12.040 --> 22:13.120
It's not a fucking pet.

22:13.160 --> 22:14.240
What happens?

22:14.280 --> 22:15.560
In the prophecy, what happens

22:15.600 --> 22:16.560
after the hellhounds
are released?

22:16.600 --> 22:18.280
What happens to the Chosen One?

22:21.800 --> 22:23.240
I don't know.

22:27.080 --> 22:28.960
You don't know?

22:29.000 --> 22:30.760
That's as far as I got.

22:30.800 --> 22:32.200
Why?

22:32.240 --> 22:33.480
I told you.

22:33.520 --> 22:35.600
They threw me out.

22:35.640 --> 22:37.600
So you don't know
the ending.

22:39.320 --> 22:40.840
No.

22:40.880 --> 22:41.960
Oh, I see.

22:42.000 --> 22:44.400
At any point,

22:44.440 --> 22:46.480
does the prophecy
make any mention

22:46.520 --> 22:48.520
of you?

22:50.720 --> 22:52.440
The prophecy
is not comprehensive.

22:52.480 --> 22:53.840
Here we go.

22:53.880 --> 22:56.040
It's supposed
to be mysterious.

22:56.080 --> 22:57.360
It doesn't mention
every little detail.

22:57.400 --> 23:00.200
Are you sure you're even
supposed to be here?

23:00.240 --> 23:01.960
Perhaps I'd do
better on my own.

23:02.000 --> 23:04.000
Don't be ridiculous.

23:04.040 --> 23:05.160
You need me.

23:05.200 --> 23:07.560
Oh, because you're
so important.

23:07.600 --> 23:10.040
So useful that
at any moment,

23:10.080 --> 23:11.120
you could turn
back into a demon

23:11.160 --> 23:13.520
and tear my head off.

23:13.560 --> 23:14.720
You've changed.

23:14.760 --> 23:15.840
You haven't.

23:15.880 --> 23:17.480
You're still a prick.

23:17.520 --> 23:19.560
Ever since you found out
you're special,

23:19.600 --> 23:20.800
you've got all the answers.

23:20.840 --> 23:22.720
I'll tell you
what a hellhound is.

23:22.760 --> 23:24.040
It's something that says,

23:24.080 --> 23:25.120
"You better start
concentrating,

23:25.160 --> 23:28.440
start trying a little harder...

23:28.480 --> 23:30.200
'cause this is no game."

23:47.880 --> 23:49.600
Fine work,
my beauty.

23:58.120 --> 24:00.560
She is not with a blind man.

24:00.600 --> 24:03.600
She is with a Druid.

24:11.320 --> 24:12.880
The bird's
a bit of a giveaway.

24:12.920 --> 24:13.920
I could see it for miles.

24:26.960 --> 24:29.800
Which are the fast ones,
and which are the slow ones?

24:29.840 --> 24:30.960
Go to hell.

24:31.000 --> 24:33.120
Funny, I've just
come from there.

24:38.400 --> 24:40.320
So...

24:40.360 --> 24:43.360
Jhehutamisu Akbolla Ramses...

24:43.400 --> 24:45.360
why don't you tell me
about this prophecy?

25:12.840 --> 25:14.640
Everything all right,
Praefectus?

25:17.480 --> 25:19.080
Praefectus?

25:21.320 --> 25:22.920
Thank you, Vitus.

25:39.160 --> 25:40.520
Word has come

25:40.560 --> 25:44.200
from the Twentieth Valeria
Victrix Legion Outriders.

25:44.240 --> 25:45.360
They're a day's march
from Crugdunon.

26:24.960 --> 26:27.040
What's your name, scribe?

26:27.080 --> 26:28.120
Marcus.

26:30.120 --> 26:32.320
Come here.
Sit with me.

26:42.840 --> 26:44.280
Sit.

26:52.840 --> 26:54.040
Thank you.

26:55.320 --> 26:56.280
Do you have children?

26:56.320 --> 26:57.280
I have four
daughters,

26:57.320 --> 26:59.240
one born in each season.

27:01.440 --> 27:03.960
And do you ever think, Marcus,
that when we're gone...

27:04.000 --> 27:06.840
when we're just bones
and a few teeth,

27:06.880 --> 27:08.360
half a bucket
of sludge...

27:10.640 --> 27:12.440
that your words
are all they'll have to know

27:12.480 --> 27:14.080
what went on up here?

27:14.120 --> 27:16.200
Yeah, but think
about it.

27:16.240 --> 27:18.080
People will read
your words,

27:18.120 --> 27:19.080
and they'll think...

27:19.120 --> 27:22.160
"That's what happened.

27:22.200 --> 27:23.560
That's what they did."

27:23.600 --> 27:25.520
So without you,

27:25.560 --> 27:27.920
this is all just
a dream of the past.

27:27.960 --> 27:32.320
So you're a very important man,
Marcus...

27:32.360 --> 27:34.680
because you...

27:36.280 --> 27:38.400
you whisper
to the future.

27:43.360 --> 27:45.160
Drink.

28:54.480 --> 28:55.480
Peckish?

28:59.440 --> 29:01.320
Untie me.

29:01.360 --> 29:03.320
Pardonnez-moi, monsieur...

29:03.360 --> 29:04.840
mais...

29:04.880 --> 29:05.920
non.

29:07.320 --> 29:09.040
For almost a moon,

29:09.080 --> 29:10.080
we've not heard
from you.

29:10.120 --> 29:11.880
Is there nothing to report?

29:11.920 --> 29:13.120
The food stocks
are dwindling.

29:13.160 --> 29:14.240
Not fast enough.

29:14.280 --> 29:16.320
There are less
than three moons' grain.

29:18.000 --> 29:19.480
How's the new queen?

29:21.400 --> 29:24.680
Bit of a test, this,
for a fledgling?

29:24.720 --> 29:27.760
The Queen
guides her people well.

29:27.800 --> 29:29.760
She gives them comfort.

29:31.520 --> 29:35.280
I'm going to let you
into a little secret, Gaul.

29:35.320 --> 29:37.240
Ever since I was a little girl,

29:37.280 --> 29:38.320
I've been able to tell

29:38.360 --> 29:40.560
when men are telling me
the truth.

29:40.600 --> 29:42.640
All I have to do
is close my eyes,

29:42.680 --> 29:43.840
hear their words,

29:43.880 --> 29:45.800
and I can tell
whether it's a lie or not.

29:45.840 --> 29:48.840
So I'm going to ask
you a question,

29:48.880 --> 29:51.040
and I'm going
to close my eyes,

29:51.080 --> 29:53.320
and if you lie to me,

29:53.360 --> 29:55.560
I'm going
to slice off your testicles

29:55.600 --> 29:58.120
and fry them up
in my big frying pan,

29:58.160 --> 30:00.400
and have you eat them...

30:00.440 --> 30:03.680
and I'm sure, hungry as you are,
you will wolf them down.

30:05.840 --> 30:09.480
What are your feelings
for the new queen?

30:11.160 --> 30:12.760
I know
where my allegiance lies.

30:12.800 --> 30:14.200
Louder, please.

30:14.240 --> 30:16.000
I know
where my allegiance lies.

30:16.040 --> 30:18.880
Then do your duty, Gaul!

32:06.440 --> 32:07.960
Is all well?

33:47.160 --> 33:48.480
Better now?

33:59.960 --> 34:01.800
Poor Marcus.

34:03.640 --> 34:06.760
You know
he had four daughters?

34:06.800 --> 34:08.600
One born in every season.

34:16.159 --> 34:17.360
Tell me, my friend...

34:19.080 --> 34:22.280
was this all
your own work...

34:22.320 --> 34:24.280
or did you have help?

34:24.320 --> 34:26.400
What have I done?

34:28.040 --> 34:29.199
We've reached
the end of the road,

34:29.239 --> 34:30.360
you and I...

34:32.199 --> 34:33.840
but for old
times' sake,

34:33.880 --> 34:36.960
I will give you
some advice...

34:37.000 --> 34:38.480
and you'd better take it.

34:43.400 --> 34:44.480
Run.

35:12.840 --> 35:14.640
Make way!

35:24.440 --> 35:25.880
Fire!

35:27.320 --> 35:28.400
Fire!

35:38.680 --> 35:40.080
Hey, hey!
There is nothing we can do.

36:20.080 --> 36:21.640
Rumbly-tums.

36:21.680 --> 36:24.280
Rumbly-tums.

36:37.960 --> 36:40.080
The sun is low in the West,

36:40.120 --> 36:43.320
and the starlings swoop
low through the forest.

36:46.040 --> 36:47.960
Take your time.

36:52.120 --> 36:53.800
After three days of rain,

36:53.840 --> 36:55.920
you find
Angel cap mushrooms

36:55.960 --> 36:57.920
on the north side
of an elderly oak.

37:02.760 --> 37:04.240
All right.

37:05.280 --> 37:07.840
Arrange these nine bones
in such a way

37:07.880 --> 37:09.040
to tell you if danger's near.

37:10.520 --> 37:13.240
My father's dead.

37:14.440 --> 37:16.560
Your father's
a resourceful guy.

37:16.600 --> 37:17.960
He can look after himself.

37:18.000 --> 37:20.200
He's blind.
I deserted him.

37:20.240 --> 37:21.200
Listen...

37:21.240 --> 37:22.840
I swore an oath
to protect him.

37:22.880 --> 37:24.000
All right.

37:24.040 --> 37:27.120
It was
a terrible mistake.

37:27.160 --> 37:29.160
I should never have left him.

37:31.600 --> 37:32.760
Everyone I love,

37:32.800 --> 37:37.480
everyone I've cared for,
who cares for me,

37:37.520 --> 37:38.720
is dead.

37:38.760 --> 37:40.160
Listen...

37:40.200 --> 37:41.800
I'm not strong enough.

37:41.840 --> 37:43.000
Whatever was supposed
to happen...

37:43.040 --> 37:46.160
it's not going to happen
because of me.

37:49.080 --> 37:51.600
I know that now.

37:51.640 --> 37:53.760
I know it clearer than anything.

37:55.680 --> 37:57.160
I'm not the one.

37:57.200 --> 37:59.800
Whatever you thought I was,
I'm not.

38:04.880 --> 38:06.120
What would Islene say
right now?

38:06.160 --> 38:07.760
Maybe I should ask her.

38:07.800 --> 38:09.040
And how are you going
to do that?

38:09.080 --> 38:09.840
Take me to the Underworld.

38:09.880 --> 38:11.040
No. No...

38:11.080 --> 38:12.200
I have to see them.

38:12.240 --> 38:14.480
You have no idea
what you're talking about.

38:14.520 --> 38:18.720
You have none of the skills,
the ways, the paths.

38:18.760 --> 38:20.120
You would never
be able to return.

38:20.160 --> 38:21.560
Who says I want to?

38:21.600 --> 38:22.880
Oh, all right.

38:22.920 --> 38:25.360
I didn't know
you were that weak.

38:27.040 --> 38:29.000
I did.

38:29.040 --> 38:30.920
I always did.

38:32.640 --> 38:33.800
Look at us.
We're nowhere.

38:37.080 --> 38:38.080
We're nowhere.

38:39.680 --> 38:41.920
You're delirious.

38:41.960 --> 38:43.160
You've eaten no food.

38:45.840 --> 38:47.320
I'm going to fetch water.

39:03.280 --> 39:05.440
Ddylai hi fod yn gryfach.

39:06.800 --> 39:08.560
Pam nad yw hi'n deall?

39:27.320 --> 39:31.080
Nid yw hyn yn gwneud.

39:36.640 --> 39:39.440
Ai hi yw hon, wir?

39:40.600 --> 39:43.440
Roedd yr arwyddion yn gryf?

39:49.600 --> 39:50.640
Celwyddgwn?

39:55.360 --> 39:57.440
Dad...

39:57.480 --> 39:58.760
I'm coming.

40:02.760 --> 40:04.280
Wait for me no more.

40:07.440 --> 40:09.120
Fuck.

40:12.360 --> 40:13.960
Fuck! I was wrong.

40:17.720 --> 40:18.840
I was wrong!

40:37.160 --> 40:40.280
Look in my eyes.
Now keep looking.

40:47.280 --> 40:48.080
No!
