<i>Kill her.
She's done.</i>

00:23.488 --> 00:25.255
<i>You're wicked.</i>

00:27.024 --> 00:28.525
<i>Burn her.
Burn her.</i>

00:40.104 --> 00:41.084
Okay.

00:41.204 --> 00:45.275
Egg whites for you, doc,
and house special for you, hon.

00:45.395 --> 00:47.377
Thanks... Hon.

00:48.212 --> 00:49.546
At...

00:49.580 --> 00:51.548
Okay.
You know what?

00:51.582 --> 00:56.086
At work, make normal pancakes.

00:56.120 --> 00:58.154
I'd love bunny pancakes.

00:58.189 --> 01:00.023
Do not encourage her.

01:00.057 --> 01:03.627
So we're clear,
No zoo-animal shapes at work.

01:03.661 --> 01:05.262
Rabbits are not zoo animals.

01:05.296 --> 01:07.130
Well, except for
the Washington pygmy,

01:07.164 --> 01:09.266
which is being bred
in captivity.

01:09.300 --> 01:10.667
Talk about breeding...

01:10.701 --> 01:13.336
I could make bunny pancakes
for grandchildren.

01:13.371 --> 01:14.371
Mom.

01:14.405 --> 01:15.572
Uh-oh.

01:15.606 --> 01:17.440
You know what that means.

01:17.475 --> 01:21.711
Drop a fork,
expect a female visitor.

01:21.746 --> 01:23.346
Are you still menstruating,
Mrs. Rizzoli?

01:23.381 --> 01:26.216
Wha-  Maura!
God. No.

01:26.250 --> 01:29.486
Other kind of visitor-
The person kind.

01:30.388 --> 01:32.389
She's very superstitious,
my mother.

01:32.423 --> 01:35.759
She believes in all that stuff
about cats and umbrellas

01:35.793 --> 01:37.327
and ladders.

01:37.361 --> 01:39.262
Had me convinced
I was gonna paralyze her

01:39.297 --> 01:40.997
if I stepped on a crack.

01:41.032 --> 01:43.333
Step on a crack,
break your mother's back.

01:43.367 --> 01:45.235
You believed that?

01:45.269 --> 01:47.370
I was 5.

01:48.773 --> 01:50.674
Don't you have other customers?

01:55.680 --> 01:59.115
Oh, my God.
What is she doing here?

01:59.150 --> 02:00.250
Who's that?

02:00.284 --> 02:01.351
Frankie's ex.

02:03.287 --> 02:05.255
Oh. Looks like
your mother likes her.

02:05.289 --> 02:06.456
Uh, no.

02:06.490 --> 02:08.725
That would be
her "I can't stand you" hug.

02:08.758 --> 02:10.193
But she way too polite

02:10.227 --> 02:11.962
to call her the word
that rhymes with "witch."

02:11.996 --> 02:14.130
- "Bitch"? Shh!
- Jane?

02:14.165 --> 02:15.765
Look who I found!

02:15.800 --> 02:18.134
Theresa, how, uh,
how you doing?

02:18.169 --> 02:19.302
Jane.

02:20.371 --> 02:21.738
- Wow!
- Yeah.

02:21.772 --> 02:22.706
Long time.

02:22.740 --> 02:24.507
What are you doing here at...

02:24.542 --> 02:27.777
- Boston police headquarters?
- Just moved back to town.

02:27.812 --> 02:30.747
And you just thought you'd
pop by the police department?

02:30.781 --> 02:32.482
Job application.

02:32.516 --> 02:34.384
Ah.
You're being fingerprinted?

02:35.353 --> 02:37.654
It's mandatory
for everyone applying.

02:37.688 --> 02:39.422
Sure. Sure.

02:39.457 --> 02:42.292
Especially for people who have
other people co-sign a car loan

02:42.326 --> 02:44.394
and then default on that loan.

02:45.262 --> 02:48.131
Good seeing you, too, Jane.

02:48.165 --> 02:49.332
See you around.

02:49.367 --> 02:51.568
Wow.

02:51.602 --> 02:54.704
<i>You just gave her
your "I can't stand you" hug.</i>

02:54.739 --> 02:56.806
Sheesh.
Uncomfortable.

02:56.841 --> 02:58.108
You want uncomfortable?

02:58.142 --> 03:00.043
Try paying off
Theresa's car loan

03:00.077 --> 03:02.312
while she skips town
and leaves you holding the bag.

03:02.346 --> 03:04.347
Well, perhaps you should've
had her fingerprinted first.

03:04.382 --> 03:05.448
No. Not me.

03:05.483 --> 03:07.984
Frankie.
It's the love of his life.

03:08.019 --> 03:09.352
She's very symmetrical.

03:09.387 --> 03:10.787
Excuse me?

03:10.821 --> 03:12.322
Well, studies have shown

03:12.356 --> 03:14.290
that women who have
symmetrical facial features

03:14.325 --> 03:15.625
are the most attractive to men.

03:15.660 --> 03:19.095
You're not helping.

03:19.130 --> 03:20.930
Rizzoli.

03:22.066 --> 03:24.334
Okay.
I'll be right there.

03:24.368 --> 03:26.336
Yummy.

03:28.439 --> 03:32.642
Theresa's back to get her
manipulative claws in Frankie.

03:32.677 --> 03:34.711
Maybe she came by to pay back
the car loan.

03:34.745 --> 03:35.578
People change.

03:35.613 --> 03:37.047
Oh, yeah.
That's it.

03:37.081 --> 03:38.682
Maybe she added seven years
of interest.

03:38.716 --> 03:41.317
What have we got?

03:41.352 --> 03:43.586
Fire investigators think it was
set in the middle of the night.

03:43.621 --> 03:45.689
- Did you find an I.D.?
- No.

03:45.723 --> 03:47.190
He can't even...

03:47.224 --> 03:48.658
He can't even tell
if it's male or female.

03:48.693 --> 03:50.193
- Why don't you get a closer look there?
- Mnh-mnh.

03:50.227 --> 03:51.561
- Huh?
- Mnh-mnh!

03:51.595 --> 03:53.797
Hmm.

03:53.831 --> 03:55.598
It's interesting.

03:55.633 --> 03:59.302
Might have to do a full autopsy
before I can tell the gender.

03:59.336 --> 04:00.737
I don't know.
This is definitely male.

04:00.771 --> 04:02.338
Oh, no.

04:02.373 --> 04:04.741
The less-pronounced supraorbital
ridges indicate female.

04:04.775 --> 04:06.076
Yes! Okay.

04:06.110 --> 04:07.544
So our victim's
definitely female.

04:07.578 --> 04:09.179
That is not fair.

04:09.213 --> 04:11.448
So an accelerant was used.

04:11.482 --> 04:14.517
Not gasoline.
Lighter fluid, maybe?

04:14.552 --> 04:16.252
Variation on pugilistic pose

04:16.286 --> 04:18.221
indicates that her wrists
and her ankles were bound.

04:18.255 --> 04:20.724
I think she died right here.
There's no sign of drag marks.

04:20.757 --> 04:23.426
Think she was alive
when she was set on fire?

04:23.461 --> 04:26.629
I know, I know.
You need time and endless tests.

04:26.664 --> 04:28.431
One thing's for sure...

04:28.466 --> 04:30.400
We're not gonna get
any fingerprints.

04:30.434 --> 04:31.601
Hmm.

04:36.540 --> 04:38.675
Pine scent.

04:38.709 --> 04:40.710
It's right where a jacket pocket
would be.

04:40.745 --> 04:42.746
Think she was wearing
air freshener?

04:44.415 --> 04:46.649
No.
I think it might be Amber.

04:48.586 --> 04:50.453
What's the shiny thing?

04:50.488 --> 04:52.622
Hmm.

04:53.691 --> 04:55.658
Fixed-bearing prosthesis.

04:55.693 --> 04:58.061
It's a titanium joint.

04:58.095 --> 04:59.429
It's a knee replacement.

04:59.463 --> 05:02.866
We don't need fingerprints.
We got a serial number.

05:05.560 --> 05:07.537

05:28.159 --> 05:29.626
Thanks.

05:29.660 --> 05:31.261
Manufacturer shipped
the knee joint

05:31.295 --> 05:32.529
to a Boston orthopedic group.

05:32.563 --> 05:34.197
They're checking
patient records.

05:34.231 --> 05:36.166
Should have a name any second.

05:36.200 --> 05:37.467
- Hey.
- Hey.

05:37.501 --> 05:40.603
We're I.D.'ing our victim
by her knee replacement.

05:40.638 --> 05:42.739
Cool.

05:42.773 --> 05:43.773
Huh.

05:43.808 --> 05:45.775
So, how's everything?

05:45.810 --> 05:47.510
Good.

05:48.479 --> 05:50.480
Anything... new today?

05:50.514 --> 05:52.816
Nope.
Not a thing.

05:52.850 --> 05:54.617
Was she here to see you?

05:54.652 --> 05:56.686
- Who?
- You know who.

05:56.720 --> 05:58.655
You guys want some privacy?
I can...

05:58.689 --> 06:00.423
What, you mean because my sister
is butting into my business?

06:00.457 --> 06:02.158
I knew it.
You were meeting with Theresa

06:02.193 --> 06:03.626
if you guys are gonna fight
right now...

06:03.661 --> 06:05.395
She was here getting
fingerprinted for a job.

06:05.429 --> 06:06.996
And it's none of your business.

06:07.031 --> 06:08.765
Did she pay you back
for that Camry?

06:08.799 --> 06:10.233
Also not your business.

06:10.267 --> 06:12.502
You bought a car for a chick?

06:12.536 --> 06:14.437
- Mm-hmm.
- Dumb, bro.

06:14.471 --> 06:15.605
Excuse me, bro.

06:15.639 --> 06:17.540
We had to scrape him
off the ceiling

06:17.575 --> 06:19.943
every time hurricane Theresa
blew into his life.

06:19.977 --> 06:22.178
Oh, you want to go there.
Fine.

06:22.213 --> 06:23.279
Let's talk about Steve Sanner.

06:23.314 --> 06:25.081
- Who's Steve Sanner?
- No one.

06:25.115 --> 06:27.550
Oh, she was nuts about him.

06:27.585 --> 06:29.185
She started wearing dresses.

06:29.220 --> 06:30.753
You should've heard her
on the phone.

06:30.788 --> 06:32.255
"Hi. Steve?

06:32.289 --> 06:34.557
I'm, like, good.
You?"

06:37.228 --> 06:39.362
Oop. Hello.

06:39.396 --> 06:42.365
Implant belonged
to Helen Downey, 43.

06:42.399 --> 06:45.468
She's got a license but no car.

06:45.502 --> 06:47.036
She lived in Hyde Park.

06:47.071 --> 06:48.638
That's close
to where we found her.

06:48.672 --> 06:50.106
Let's go check it out.

06:50.140 --> 06:52.141
"Bro."

06:52.176 --> 06:53.643
Car?

07:02.219 --> 07:03.720
You need to put your shoulder
into it.

07:03.754 --> 07:05.288
Please.
Show me.

07:05.322 --> 07:06.689
That's a new guy's job.

07:06.724 --> 07:08.591
I've been the new guy
for two years.

07:08.626 --> 07:10.493
I will tell you when you're not
the new guy anymore.

07:10.613 --> 07:14.264
There's no sign of struggle,
so Helen wasn't taken by force.

07:14.298 --> 07:15.498
What is that smell?

07:15.532 --> 07:17.333
Kitty litter box.
Needs changing.

07:17.368 --> 07:18.668
Kitty!

07:18.702 --> 07:19.802
Kitty! Kitty! Kitty!
Kitty! Kitty!

07:19.837 --> 07:21.671
Kitty!

07:21.705 --> 07:23.506
Ooh.

07:23.540 --> 07:25.208
Pretty little kitty-kitty.

07:26.410 --> 07:28.811
Oh, no.
I don't like black cats.

07:28.846 --> 07:30.280
It's not a black thing.

07:30.314 --> 07:31.848
It's just...
It's your cat baby talk.

07:31.882 --> 07:35.785
Hello... Worthington.

07:35.819 --> 07:37.620
You're a good boy.

07:37.655 --> 07:39.022
Poor guy.

07:39.056 --> 07:40.390
She painted his nails pink?

07:40.424 --> 07:41.691
Oh, they're nail caps.

07:41.725 --> 07:43.426
Keep you from tearing
the furniture.

07:43.460 --> 07:46.896
Hmm. That, to me, says that
Worthington was an inside cat.

07:48.766 --> 07:52.035
"Epicurean cat."
Pampered, too.

07:52.069 --> 07:54.504
Oh, yeah.

07:54.538 --> 07:56.139
Oh, this cat's hungry.

07:56.173 --> 07:58.274
He's been alone
for at least 24 hours.

07:58.309 --> 08:00.276
It's walking distance to
the clearing where we found her.

08:00.311 --> 08:02.445
So maybe Helen knew her killer
and met him there.

08:02.479 --> 08:04.447
Not much of a social butterfly,
that Helen.

08:04.481 --> 08:06.149
Didn't do much entertaining.

08:06.183 --> 08:09.519
Box of historical records.
This goes back to...

08:09.553 --> 08:11.254
Man.
Look at this.

08:11.288 --> 08:14.023
1690.
Looks original.

08:14.058 --> 08:16.159
She kept everything.
Piles of mail, too.

08:16.193 --> 08:18.628
I'll get Crime Scene Response
to box it up and bring it in.

08:18.662 --> 08:20.530
Where does this go?
It's locked.

08:20.564 --> 08:21.597
Hey, new guy.

08:21.632 --> 08:24.767
If I end up on disability,
it's on you.

08:28.505 --> 08:31.074
Korsak,
that looks like disability.

08:36.547 --> 08:39.015
Oh, this reminds me
of "The Devil's Rejects."

08:39.049 --> 08:40.984
- You ever see that one?
- I hate horror films.

08:41.018 --> 08:42.452
Haven't you got enough
on your mind?

08:42.486 --> 08:44.087
Hm.
You're missing out.

08:44.121 --> 08:47.023
Ever see, uh,
"Zombies Invade Boston"?

08:47.057 --> 08:48.591
How is it
you can't look at a dead body

08:48.625 --> 08:51.060
but you can watch zombies
chew their own arms off?

08:56.633 --> 08:58.468
Hi, Maura.

08:58.502 --> 09:00.069
Crime lab identified
the substance

09:00.104 --> 09:01.304
in Helen's pocket.

09:01.338 --> 09:03.306
Fossilized tree resin...
Amber.

09:03.340 --> 09:05.742
Okay. That's great.
But I'm a little busy right now.

09:05.776 --> 09:08.745
Oh, you got to see this.

09:10.581 --> 09:12.415
Can you see
what we're looking at?

09:14.351 --> 09:16.486
That table looks like an altar.

09:18.455 --> 09:20.857
That looks like a human skull.

09:22.159 --> 09:24.060
I have Helen's cause
of death. What was it?

09:24.094 --> 09:26.496
- Did she die by curse?
- No.

09:26.530 --> 09:29.365
I found soot lining her airway,
edema in her lung tissue.

09:29.400 --> 09:31.567
Maura, is it possible

09:31.602 --> 09:34.137
that Helen Downey was burned
at the stake?

09:34.171 --> 09:35.605
Why?

09:38.375 --> 09:41.210
Because I think Helen Downey
was a witch.

09:44.562 --> 09:45.608
It's blood, right?

09:45.728 --> 09:47.003
I don't know yet.

09:47.585 --> 09:49.765
Well, why did you rush
all the way over here

09:49.799 --> 09:51.900
if you're gonna take
as long as you take in your lab?

09:51.934 --> 09:53.268
Can you hover somewhere else?

09:53.302 --> 09:55.370
<i>Somebody did get a visitor
today.</i>

09:55.404 --> 09:58.173
Look at all these weird things.

09:58.207 --> 09:59.441
I had these crazy
wiccan neighbors.

09:59.475 --> 10:00.742
Aggressive bunch.

10:00.777 --> 10:02.110
They took
all the parking spaces.

10:02.145 --> 10:05.480
Do you think Helen
was a wiccan witch?

10:05.515 --> 10:07.215
Wicca is a Neo-pagan religion.

10:07.250 --> 10:10.218
Its practitioners use white
magic to bring about good.

10:10.253 --> 10:12.888
This altar doesn't look like
it's up to anything good.

10:12.922 --> 10:14.856
I agree.

10:14.891 --> 10:17.325
It suggests a darker, more
traditional form of witchcraft.

10:17.360 --> 10:19.427
I don't even want to know
how you know that.

10:19.462 --> 10:22.264
Phenolphthalein test indicates it is blood.

10:22.298 --> 10:24.766
Human? This is an altar, not a crime lab.

10:24.801 --> 10:26.201
These bones have holes in them.

10:26.235 --> 10:27.769
Perforations.

10:27.804 --> 10:30.739
This is from
an articulated skeleton.

10:30.773 --> 10:33.241
Connected...
like for a science classroom.

10:33.276 --> 10:35.777
Yes. It's perfectly legal.
You can buy it on eBay.

10:35.812 --> 10:37.879
Yeah, but you can't buy bowls
of blood on eBay.

10:37.914 --> 10:39.247
Well, those who practice
the dark arts

10:39.282 --> 10:40.849
give blood to use in spells.

10:40.883 --> 10:44.219
Again, never tell me
how you know this.

10:45.421 --> 10:48.190
Black is used
to cast an evil spell.

10:48.224 --> 10:50.559
Is that hair and fingernails?

10:50.593 --> 10:53.728
Mm.
A love spell.

10:54.497 --> 10:56.031
Helen never heard of
online dating?

10:56.065 --> 10:58.366
What's this for?

10:58.401 --> 11:01.937
Amber.
It's used to ward off disease.

11:01.971 --> 11:03.772
That's the same stuff
that we found on Helen.

11:03.806 --> 11:06.107
Okay.
What is she doing to this guy?

11:07.176 --> 11:08.910
Angelica root.

11:08.945 --> 11:10.412
It's used for protection.

11:10.446 --> 11:16.184
So we've got evil, healing,
love, and protection.

11:16.219 --> 11:19.554
Adds up to one weird victim.

11:22.458 --> 11:25.193
You had to take a witch's cat.

11:25.228 --> 11:27.863
I'm fostering Baretta
till he can find a loving home.

11:27.897 --> 11:29.164
Baretta.

11:29.198 --> 11:31.299
Didn't want to go through life
as Worthington.

11:31.334 --> 11:32.834
Mm.
He tell you that?

11:32.869 --> 11:34.269
What else he tell you?

11:34.303 --> 11:37.272
He eats sautéed chicken livers,
likes down pillows?

11:37.306 --> 11:39.708
Leave him alone. He's
the sweetest cat in the world.

11:39.742 --> 11:42.277
Helen collected genealogies.

11:42.311 --> 11:44.846
Look at these family trees.

11:44.881 --> 11:47.782
John Proctor.
William Hobbs.

11:47.817 --> 11:51.019
This is incredible.
Look at the date... 1692.

11:51.053 --> 11:52.954
That's when
the Salem witch trials began.

11:52.989 --> 11:54.956
<i>Maybe Helen was descended
from witches.</i>

11:54.991 --> 11:57.025
Take any history
at Southie High?

11:57.059 --> 11:59.160
Puritans persecuted anybody
who was different.

11:59.195 --> 12:01.863
Yeah. Witchcraft was a felony
punishable by death.

12:01.898 --> 12:03.732
Oh, okay. This is cool,
too.

12:03.766 --> 12:04.933
It's a deed of trust

12:04.967 --> 12:06.401
from the land
where we found Helen's body.

12:06.435 --> 12:10.338
It's been modified,
but the original date is 1680.

12:10.373 --> 12:11.806
The land where Helen was killed

12:11.841 --> 12:13.475
belonged to her family
for centuries.

12:13.509 --> 12:15.911
Three acres in Hyde park.
What's that worth?

12:15.945 --> 12:16.878
A lot.

12:16.913 --> 12:18.380
She could've used the money,
too.

12:18.414 --> 12:20.248
Letters from her landlord.
She was behind in her rent.

12:20.283 --> 12:23.718
Helen was a descendant
of William and Mary Warrick.

12:23.753 --> 12:25.253
Wow.
Early settlers of Salem.

12:25.288 --> 12:27.822
Land was passed to her
through all these generations.

12:27.857 --> 12:29.891
Slaves came with it
back in the day.

12:29.926 --> 12:32.093
Good times in colonial Boston.

12:32.128 --> 12:34.696
Hey, women were considered
property.

12:39.468 --> 12:40.802
What are you looking at me for?

12:40.836 --> 12:42.804
I don't even have
a cleaning lady.

12:42.838 --> 12:45.173
What's with the registered
letters? All from the same guy.

12:45.207 --> 12:47.275
Real estate agent.
Robert Cranston.

12:47.310 --> 12:49.878
Cranston.

12:49.912 --> 12:52.314
<i>Hi. I'm Robert Cranston.
And if you...</i>

12:52.348 --> 12:54.382
Hey, that's the guy
that's getting the evil curse

12:54.417 --> 12:55.750
in Helen's basement.

12:55.785 --> 12:57.352
He's also
a real estate developer

12:57.386 --> 13:00.422
who's been buying up all the
land around Helen's property.

13:00.456 --> 13:03.091
- What for?
- He's building a monster mall there.

13:03.125 --> 13:06.127
He offered Helen
$3 million for her land.

13:06.162 --> 13:09.397
So he owns all the parcels
except Helen's

13:09.432 --> 13:10.966
Lone holdout.

13:11.000 --> 13:13.034
Looks like Helen kept him
from building his mall.

13:13.069 --> 13:14.369
That cost him.

13:14.403 --> 13:15.837
Do you have her will yet?

13:15.871 --> 13:17.105
- No.
- Okay.

13:17.139 --> 13:18.840
She's not married.
No will.

13:18.874 --> 13:20.442
Maybe Cranston can't get
her land unless he kills her

13:20.476 --> 13:21.977
and buys it from the estate.

13:22.011 --> 13:24.346
Well, that would be an offer
she couldn't refuse.

13:27.350 --> 13:28.984
We appreciate you coming in.

13:29.018 --> 13:30.919
I don't have a lot of time.

13:30.953 --> 13:33.355
We're going to need to know
where you were Saturday...

13:33.389 --> 13:34.990
day and nighttime.

13:35.024 --> 13:37.092
I was in Worcester,
at the grand-opening celebration

13:37.126 --> 13:38.259
of my newest gated community.

13:38.294 --> 13:40.128
And then I was asleep
at my hotel.

13:40.162 --> 13:41.896
Check.
You'll see.

13:41.931 --> 13:43.031
Could you turn that off,
please?

13:43.065 --> 13:44.432
It's business.

13:44.467 --> 13:45.467
I do a lot of it.

13:46.369 --> 13:47.969
Did you ever meet
with Helen Downey?

13:48.004 --> 13:49.904
Once. That was enough.
She's nuts.

13:49.939 --> 13:51.940
'Cause she wouldn't sell
her property to you?

13:51.974 --> 13:54.409
I offered her $3 million
for that weed patch...

13:54.443 --> 13:55.810
Double what it was worth.

13:55.845 --> 13:57.445
She said it was sacred.

13:57.480 --> 13:59.414
Why did she think
it was sacred?

13:59.448 --> 14:02.751
Something to do with
her ancestors, witches.

14:02.785 --> 14:03.618
Who knows?
Whack job.

14:04.687 --> 14:06.988
We're investigating
Helen Downey's murder.

14:09.058 --> 14:10.425
Am I under arrest?

14:10.459 --> 14:11.993
No.

14:13.029 --> 14:16.264
Then I know both my rights
and my way out.

14:23.172 --> 14:25.807
Too bad we can't hold him
for being a sleazebag.

14:25.841 --> 14:28.043
Guy that rich wouldn't dirty
his own hands.

14:28.077 --> 14:30.745
Yeah. Probably not.
He'd hire somebody.

14:30.780 --> 14:32.247
I'll check out his alibi,

14:32.281 --> 14:34.382
run background checks
on his employees.

14:35.885 --> 14:37.919
The blood in the bowl
didn't belong to Helen.

14:37.953 --> 14:40.055
- Any chance we'll get a DNA hit?
- Possibly.

14:40.089 --> 14:41.356
I'm still waiting
on the results

14:41.390 --> 14:43.391
from the fingernails
and hair from the altar.

14:43.426 --> 14:46.394
Did you find anything to confirm
that Helen was crazy?

14:46.429 --> 14:49.164
Korsak said that the real estate
developer claims

14:49.198 --> 14:50.732
she was a nut bar.

14:50.766 --> 14:53.001
You know, the genetics
of mental illnesses

14:53.035 --> 14:55.070
are much more complex
than the genetics

14:55.104 --> 14:57.672
of many of the rare,
single-gene diseases.

14:57.706 --> 15:01.176
"Yes" or "no"...
Perfectly good answers.

15:01.210 --> 15:02.877
No.

15:04.713 --> 15:07.182
I'm going as fast as I can.

15:07.216 --> 15:09.784
Three sandwiches.
Big lunch.

15:09.819 --> 15:11.319
Yeah.
I'm meeting some people.

15:11.353 --> 15:13.788
Is that why you're wearing
all that cologne?

15:13.823 --> 15:15.657
It's quite lovely.

15:15.691 --> 15:20.028
Hints of orange blended
with notes of cedar and...

15:21.263 --> 15:23.298
Verbena.

15:23.332 --> 15:24.899
Yeah. Thanks.

15:24.934 --> 15:25.967
Ma, I got to run.

15:26.001 --> 15:26.968
Okay.

15:27.002 --> 15:29.003
See ya. Bye.

15:29.038 --> 15:31.206
Enjoy!
Where's he off to?

15:31.240 --> 15:33.641
A picnic at the
public gardens.

15:33.676 --> 15:35.276
- Is it with Theresa?
- Oh, I hope not.

15:35.311 --> 15:37.946
I mean,
how could he not remember

15:37.980 --> 15:39.714
how much pain
she put me through?

15:39.748 --> 15:41.249
You?

15:41.283 --> 15:44.018
Ma, he was depressed for months
when she found a new guy

15:44.053 --> 15:45.787
and dumped him on his ass...
again.

15:45.821 --> 15:47.989
- I remember.
- That can be quite serious.

15:48.023 --> 15:49.224
Broken heart syndrome,

15:49.258 --> 15:51.893
also known as
stress cardiomyopathy.

15:51.927 --> 15:55.163
It can cause rapid and severe
heart-muscle weakness.

15:55.197 --> 15:56.264
Oh, my God.

15:56.298 --> 15:58.032
You got to do something.

16:06.208 --> 16:07.976
You see him?

16:08.010 --> 16:09.210
No.

16:11.347 --> 16:14.015
It's hot,
and I smell like a French fry.

16:14.049 --> 16:15.950
That's because we're in
direct sunlight.

16:15.985 --> 16:19.387
I know that, 007.
That's why I'm hot.

16:21.757 --> 16:24.425
You feel that?
Ventilation fan.

16:24.460 --> 16:26.961
Hm.

16:26.996 --> 16:27.929
Magic.

16:27.963 --> 16:29.030
No.

16:29.064 --> 16:31.099
Solar panels
on the roof of my car.

16:31.133 --> 16:33.401
They automatically generate
enough electricity

16:33.435 --> 16:34.435
to cool us off.

16:34.470 --> 16:35.803
How green.

16:35.838 --> 16:36.971
Isn't it?

16:37.006 --> 16:39.140
Does it get rid
of French-fry smell?

16:40.609 --> 16:42.443
How is it that you can't lie

16:42.478 --> 16:44.646
but you can talk me into spying
on my brother?

16:44.680 --> 16:46.948
- We're not spying.
- We're not.

16:46.982 --> 16:49.918
We are gathering data
to test a hypothesis,

16:49.952 --> 16:51.920
which is the first step
of scientific inquiry.

16:51.954 --> 16:53.188
Nice try.

16:53.222 --> 16:57.825
We... you and I...
are snooping, meddling.

16:57.860 --> 17:01.729
We are sticking our noses
where they do not belong.

17:01.764 --> 17:04.065
Oh, my God.

17:06.035 --> 17:07.835
I just turned into my mother.

17:09.371 --> 17:11.005
Hypothesis confirmed...

17:11.040 --> 17:13.808
I would recognize
that cheap dye job anywhere.

17:18.646 --> 17:19.714
It's Korsak.

17:19.748 --> 17:20.915
Rizzoli.

17:20.950 --> 17:22.116
And Isles.

17:22.151 --> 17:24.219
We found Helen Downey's will.

17:24.252 --> 17:26.054
She left her land
to three people.

17:26.088 --> 17:27.188
They all live in old Salem.

17:27.223 --> 17:30.091
Sending you the photos now.

17:30.125 --> 17:31.859
See the goofball
with all the piercings?

17:31.894 --> 17:32.894
Yeah.

17:32.928 --> 17:34.762
Grayson Bennett, 33.

17:34.797 --> 17:37.799
Who's the beautiful one
with the lip stud?

17:37.833 --> 17:39.000
Sage Molette, 29.

17:39.034 --> 17:40.902
And the young one
is Sabrina Scott.

17:40.936 --> 17:42.870
Sabrina is a very old
Welsh name.

17:42.905 --> 17:45.173
It's also a name
of the teenage witch.

17:45.207 --> 17:47.008
All three of them work

17:47.042 --> 17:48.009
at the Spellbox.

17:48.043 --> 17:49.444
Oh, that's an occult store.

17:49.478 --> 17:51.079
What, you shop there?

17:51.113 --> 17:53.114
I've bought gifts.

17:57.286 --> 17:58.820
Got to go.

18:00.422 --> 18:02.090
Hi.
What are you doing here?

18:02.124 --> 18:03.625
You followed me.

18:03.659 --> 18:04.759
We did.

18:04.793 --> 18:06.094
But we're just testing
a hypothesis.

18:06.128 --> 18:07.195
We are not snooping.

18:07.229 --> 18:09.063
Oh, really?
What's your hypothesis?

18:09.098 --> 18:11.699
If I meet Theresa for lunch,
it's your business?

18:11.734 --> 18:12.967
No, we were trying
to determine

18:13.002 --> 18:14.135
whether you're
getting back together.

18:14.169 --> 18:15.637
Please stop talking.

18:15.671 --> 18:17.839
Hypotheses require
rigorous testing. It's...

18:17.873 --> 18:19.807
- You want to know what I'm doing here?
- No.

18:19.842 --> 18:20.975
Fine.

18:24.913 --> 18:26.080
This is my daughter.

18:27.049 --> 18:29.183
Lily, say hi to your
Aunt Jane.

18:29.218 --> 18:30.652
Hi.

18:30.686 --> 18:32.420
Hello.

18:35.324 --> 18:36.724
You want a French fry?

18:36.759 --> 18:39.294
No. My mom says
they make you look fat.

18:51.961 --> 18:53.459
Lily is adorable.

18:53.579 --> 18:55.022
She looks like Frankie.

18:55.332 --> 18:57.205
Yeah, she's really cute.

18:57.804 --> 19:00.539
And innocent,
unlike her mother.

19:00.573 --> 19:02.207
My gut says Theresa's broke

19:02.242 --> 19:04.510
and she's using her kid
to get Frankie back.

19:04.544 --> 19:06.979
Paternity is very easy
to check.

19:07.013 --> 19:08.113
Oh, sure, Maura.

19:08.147 --> 19:10.182
I'll just ask Lily
for a little saliva.

19:10.216 --> 19:12.651
We got a lot of work to do.
Let's get to Salem.

19:12.685 --> 19:14.887
They call it "city of peace"
now.

19:14.921 --> 19:16.188
That's very nice of them,

19:16.222 --> 19:18.023
since they put
19 innocent people to death

19:18.057 --> 19:19.491
in the witch trials.

19:20.560 --> 19:23.228
What? Salem was
my favorite field trip.

19:23.263 --> 19:25.497
I've been there six times.

19:32.038 --> 19:34.706
I can't believe she's gone.

19:34.741 --> 19:37.843
What was your relationship
to Helen Downey?

19:37.877 --> 19:40.579
We were members
of the same coven.

19:40.613 --> 19:43.115
Make sure to get the names
of the other nine.

19:43.149 --> 19:44.950
- What?
- "Coven."

19:44.984 --> 19:46.885
It's the middle English word
for "convent."

19:46.920 --> 19:49.221
It's an assembly of 13 witches.

19:50.256 --> 19:53.058
Are there 13 members
of your coven?

19:53.092 --> 19:54.693
Only four.

19:54.727 --> 19:56.895
But Helen was working
on building our membership.

19:56.930 --> 19:58.997
We're hereditary witches.

19:59.032 --> 20:01.233
- That means...
- Six field trips.

20:01.267 --> 20:02.668
I got this.

20:02.702 --> 20:03.969
Okay.

20:04.003 --> 20:06.672
That means you inherited
your practices

20:06.706 --> 20:09.107
and rituals and magic
from ancestors.

20:09.142 --> 20:12.177
That explains all the genealogy
stuff we found at Helen's.

20:12.211 --> 20:14.046
Mm-hmm.

20:14.080 --> 20:15.614
Would it surprise you to know

20:15.648 --> 20:17.749
that Helen named
the three of you in her will?

20:17.784 --> 20:20.118
No.
We were her family.

20:20.153 --> 20:23.221
And yet there's only a photo
of you on her altar.

20:23.256 --> 20:25.691
Seems she was attempting
a love spell.

20:25.725 --> 20:28.026
Were you ever involved
with Helen?

20:29.195 --> 20:30.662
Yes.

20:30.697 --> 20:34.700
But I realized
for our coven to function...

20:35.835 --> 20:39.338
Each of our lives had to be
equally intertwined.

20:39.372 --> 20:42.674
Did you all intertwine
in Helen's basement?

20:42.709 --> 20:45.677
We performed rituals.
Yes.

20:45.712 --> 20:46.979
Okay.

20:47.013 --> 20:49.281
We're gonna need to collect
DNA samples from you.

20:49.315 --> 20:51.783
I'm gonna need to swab the
inside of your mouths,

20:51.818 --> 20:53.118
if that's all right.

20:53.152 --> 20:57.422
Also, do any of you recognize
this man?

20:58.791 --> 21:00.859
It's the Reverend
William Scott.

21:00.893 --> 21:03.161
Scott?

21:04.197 --> 21:06.832
That's your last name,
isn't it?

21:06.866 --> 21:07.766
Is he your father?

21:07.800 --> 21:09.701
Yes.
Were you aware

21:09.736 --> 21:11.970
that Helen had cast
a protective spell against him?

21:12.005 --> 21:15.007
My father wasn't happy
that I had joined.

21:15.041 --> 21:18.076
Did your father ever make
any threats against Helen?

21:18.111 --> 21:21.146
He would never hurt anyone.
He's a man of God.

21:21.180 --> 21:23.782
Man of God.

21:23.816 --> 21:27.819
Same men who've persecuted us
for hundreds of years.

21:27.854 --> 21:29.721
Do you know of anyone
that would want Helen dead?

21:29.756 --> 21:33.125
You know what?
Why don't we ask Helen?

21:33.159 --> 21:35.193
Because Helen's dead.

21:35.228 --> 21:36.962
I think he means a séance.

21:36.996 --> 21:38.630
We'll have one tonight...

21:38.665 --> 21:40.666
at her home.

21:40.700 --> 21:42.234
You're welcome to attend.

21:48.274 --> 21:49.941
Séance?

21:49.976 --> 21:51.877
What ever happened to the good
old-fashioned interrogation?

21:51.911 --> 21:53.712
Come on.
It'll be fun.

21:53.746 --> 21:55.047
Like traveling to Borneo.

21:55.081 --> 21:57.215
Investigative work
is not supposed to be fun.

21:57.250 --> 22:00.052
That's why they call it "work."
Borneo? Really?

22:00.086 --> 22:01.586
Well, my work is fun.

22:01.621 --> 22:03.555
- You think Frankie told your mom?
- No way.

22:03.589 --> 22:05.824
Did you hear the good news?
I'm a grandmother.

22:05.858 --> 22:07.159
- Isn't it wonderful?
- Okay.

22:07.193 --> 22:09.695
Ma, slow down, all right?

22:09.729 --> 22:11.263
Isn't she adorable?

22:11.297 --> 22:14.933
She uses a napkin and she chews
with her mouth closed.

22:14.967 --> 22:16.201
Unlike her mother.

22:16.235 --> 22:20.138
Listen, Lily can't help it
her mother is a bit...

22:20.173 --> 22:21.740
a-a bit flaky.

22:21.774 --> 22:24.142
Look, let's let bygones
be bygones.

22:24.177 --> 22:26.778
It's very healthy to move past
old grievances.

22:26.813 --> 22:28.513
No one asked you.

22:28.548 --> 22:32.084
And I'm not ready to withdraw
my grievances against Theresa.

22:34.187 --> 22:36.855
Dr. Isles...

22:36.889 --> 22:38.290
Could I possibly trouble you

22:38.324 --> 22:41.760
to host a little family
get-together?

22:41.794 --> 22:43.061
- No.
- Of course.

22:43.096 --> 22:44.262
Thank you.

22:45.231 --> 22:46.298
What was that?

22:46.332 --> 22:47.699
Hospitality?

22:47.734 --> 22:50.969
No, Ms. Buttinsky.
It was butting in.

22:51.003 --> 22:52.137
- Oh, hey.
- Hey.

22:52.171 --> 22:54.206
- Got Helen's phone records.
- Oh.

22:54.240 --> 22:55.874
Sabrina's father, the reverend,

22:55.908 --> 22:57.409
called her hundreds of times
in the last six months.

22:57.443 --> 22:58.810
So he was harassing Helen.

23:00.079 --> 23:05.183
Helen convinced my daughter she
had inherited mystical powers.

23:05.218 --> 23:07.619
How'd she do that?

23:07.653 --> 23:11.490
Helen found Sabrina,
showed her our family ancestry.

23:12.959 --> 23:16.695
My daughter didn't know
we are related to Sarah Good.

23:16.729 --> 23:18.630
<i>The Sarah Good...</i>

23:18.664 --> 23:21.833
Who was put to death
for witchcraft in 1692?

23:21.868 --> 23:24.569
You don't believe your ancestor
was a witch, do you?

23:24.604 --> 23:28.206
I know that Sarah Good
was a devil worshiper.

23:28.241 --> 23:30.575
That's what Helen was, too.

23:30.610 --> 23:34.012
She made my daughter reject
her faith and her family.

23:34.046 --> 23:35.847
That must've made you angry.

23:35.882 --> 23:38.016
Yes.

23:38.050 --> 23:40.352
And it also broke my heart.

23:40.386 --> 23:41.787
In her restraining order,

23:41.821 --> 23:43.822
Sabrina said you tried to
abduct her.

23:44.757 --> 23:46.958
I hired a deprogrammer.

23:48.227 --> 23:51.630
I was trying to get her away

23:51.664 --> 23:54.132
from those that were
leading her astray.

23:54.167 --> 23:55.667
Can you blame me?

23:55.701 --> 23:57.335
Only if you killed
Helen Downey.

23:57.370 --> 24:00.539
As God as my witness,
I did not.

24:00.573 --> 24:01.973
Well, don't go anywhere.

24:02.008 --> 24:03.842
We may need to speak to you
again.

24:06.279 --> 24:09.548
Okay.
Let's put someone on him 24/7.

24:09.582 --> 24:12.317
Guy gives me the creeps, too.

24:17.323 --> 24:19.891
Ugh.
What is she doing?

24:19.926 --> 24:21.827
A feeding ritual.

24:21.861 --> 24:23.662
In the Hua society
of New Guinea,

24:23.696 --> 24:25.730
feeding and sexual intercourse

24:25.765 --> 24:29.067
are believed to transfer
the vital essence, nu.

24:31.003 --> 24:33.572
I'm leaving
if sexual intercourse is next.

24:33.606 --> 24:35.941
I'm not.
Me either.

24:43.583 --> 24:46.685
We call upon the powers that be

24:46.719 --> 24:50.255
to open a doorway
to the other side

24:50.289 --> 24:54.159
and allow us to conjure, stir,

24:54.193 --> 24:57.729
and summon the spirit
of Helen Downey.

24:57.763 --> 24:59.798
I don't like this.

24:59.832 --> 25:01.166
It's okay.

25:01.200 --> 25:04.336
If you get scared,
you can hold my hand.

25:06.906 --> 25:10.675
Helen...Are you with us?

25:25.925 --> 25:27.459
"Fig."

25:29.662 --> 25:31.897
Ooh. Spooky.

25:31.931 --> 25:34.199
I just had one
in your honor, Helen.

25:35.334 --> 25:37.569
She loved figs.

25:37.603 --> 25:39.571
No kidding.

25:39.605 --> 25:41.673
No, Maura.
No kidding.

25:41.707 --> 25:45.477
Helen, do you know
who killed you?

25:51.717 --> 25:52.884
Yes.

25:52.919 --> 25:55.053
How reliable is that thing?

25:55.087 --> 25:56.888
I am your vessel.

25:56.923 --> 25:59.724
Tell me...
Who killed you, Helen?

26:11.904 --> 26:16.675
My killer... is near!

26:27.753 --> 26:29.220
Uh-oh.

26:30.974 --> 26:32.688
Helen said her killer was near.

26:32.808 --> 26:34.501
Really?
"Helen said"?

26:34.741 --> 26:36.208
Well, you're right.

26:36.242 --> 26:37.676
- That sounded a little silly.
- A little.

26:37.710 --> 26:40.712
I don't suppose you've heard of
the ideomotor effect.

26:40.747 --> 26:43.715
Sure. That's when idiots pretend
to talk to the dead.

26:43.750 --> 26:47.352
Unconscious muscular actions in
response to a thought or idea.

26:47.387 --> 26:49.421
It could be
why the board moved.

26:49.455 --> 26:51.356
Fake. Phony.

26:51.391 --> 26:52.758
Like Theresa,

26:52.792 --> 26:54.926
who I now get to watch chew
with her mouth open,

26:54.961 --> 26:56.628
thanks to you.

26:57.630 --> 26:58.697
Ah.

26:58.731 --> 27:00.499
Okay. It's heavy.

27:03.703 --> 27:04.770
Okay!

27:04.804 --> 27:06.638
Frankie, you get to do
the honors.

27:06.672 --> 27:07.672
You sure?

27:07.707 --> 27:09.307
Yeah.

27:09.342 --> 27:10.542
Okay.

27:11.411 --> 27:12.811
Wow.

27:12.845 --> 27:15.313
Ma's never let anybody but pop
cut the meat before.

27:15.348 --> 27:17.649
Well, now that Frankie's
a father.

27:17.683 --> 27:19.618
We don't know that, Maura.

27:21.054 --> 27:23.422
- So, how'd the job interview go?
- Good.

27:23.456 --> 27:25.490
They said they'd let me know
by the end of the week.

27:25.525 --> 27:28.427
So, uh, you looking into
the food-service industries?

27:30.129 --> 27:33.165
I haven't worked in a fast-food
restaurant in years.

27:33.199 --> 27:34.166
I'm in medicine now.

27:34.200 --> 27:36.168
Medicine?
Really?

27:36.202 --> 27:38.370
I'm a nurse.
Oh. Nurse's aide.

27:38.404 --> 27:39.905
Oh, wow.
That's great.

27:39.939 --> 27:42.274
So you, like, change sheets

27:42.308 --> 27:45.710
and empty bedpans...
That sort of stuff?

27:45.745 --> 27:46.845
I'm getting certified.

27:46.879 --> 27:48.280
That's wonderful.

27:48.314 --> 27:51.750
I'm sure you're
a very nurturing person.

27:51.784 --> 27:53.351
Yeah, that's... that's what
we've always said about her.

27:53.386 --> 27:55.320
- Isn't that right, mom?
- Hmm?

27:55.354 --> 27:57.456
We sure did.

27:57.490 --> 27:58.757
Would you like a potato?

27:58.791 --> 28:01.693
So, uh, what brings you back
to Boston?

28:01.727 --> 28:04.663
I wanted my daughter
to have some stability.

28:04.697 --> 28:07.866
Be around family, you know?

28:07.900 --> 28:09.868
Of course.
Family is the...

28:09.902 --> 28:12.437
How are your parents?

28:12.472 --> 28:13.738
Jane?

28:15.408 --> 28:17.542
Thank you.

28:20.313 --> 28:22.814
Wow. Lily, my goodness.
You are so grown-up.

28:22.849 --> 28:23.782
How old are you?

28:23.816 --> 28:25.817
- Seven.
- Seven?

28:25.852 --> 28:27.319
Wow.

28:27.353 --> 28:29.521
You are almost as old
as your mommy's Camry.

28:30.389 --> 28:32.457
Jane, come help me
in the kitchen.

28:32.492 --> 28:33.592
I'm not finished.

28:33.626 --> 28:34.826
This will just take a second.

28:34.861 --> 28:37.062
Hey, Frankie,
get me some more wine.

28:41.467 --> 28:44.503
Uh, Lily, would...
would you like some more milk?

28:44.537 --> 28:45.604
Yes, please.

28:45.638 --> 28:46.972
I'll get it for you, baby.

28:48.975 --> 28:51.877
She is so well-mannered.

28:51.911 --> 28:53.578
Mm-hmm.

28:55.181 --> 28:56.681
That's the mother of my child.

28:56.716 --> 28:58.150
You sure about that?

28:58.184 --> 29:00.185
She's always taken advantage
of you, lied to you...

29:00.219 --> 29:01.219
cheated on you.

29:01.254 --> 29:03.121
- Will you stop?
- No!

29:03.156 --> 29:04.856
I can't stand
to see this happen again...

29:04.891 --> 29:06.725
Not to you
and not to that little girl.

29:06.759 --> 29:10.829
Lily is not some car
you can buy with Theresa.

29:10.863 --> 29:13.365
She deserves to know the truth,
Frankie, and so do you.

29:13.399 --> 29:16.401
You are really lucky
there's company around.

29:16.435 --> 29:20.238
Frankie.
Come... come here!

29:24.343 --> 29:25.810
Yeah, Frost.
What's up?

29:25.845 --> 29:27.779
What? When?

29:27.813 --> 29:30.248
All right.
We'll be right there.

29:30.283 --> 29:32.317
What's the matter?

29:32.351 --> 29:35.420
We got to go.
Another witch got attacked.

29:37.356 --> 29:38.456
Get your purse.

29:38.491 --> 29:39.524
What?

29:39.559 --> 29:41.459
Get your purse.

29:44.230 --> 29:46.364
Oh, my God.
I'm going straight to hell.

29:46.399 --> 29:48.733
I'm stealing the sippy cup.

29:49.735 --> 29:51.937
Go to the car.
Go.

29:55.608 --> 29:57.309
Hi.

29:57.343 --> 29:59.444
- We know what happened?
- Sabrina was alone,

29:59.478 --> 30:01.780
closing out the register,
when she was attacked.

30:01.814 --> 30:04.449
- Was it a robbery?
- Don't think so. The money's still there.

30:04.483 --> 30:05.417
She was lucky.

30:05.451 --> 30:06.518
Weren't for that sculpture,

30:06.552 --> 30:07.786
she'd have been crushed
to death.

30:07.820 --> 30:08.820
I want to talk to her.

30:08.854 --> 30:10.622
- She's pretty shook up.
- Okay.

30:15.394 --> 30:16.561
Hi, Sabrina.

30:16.596 --> 30:19.898
You remember me?
I'm Detective Rizzoli.

30:19.932 --> 30:21.967
I'm a doctor.
I can check her out.

30:24.737 --> 30:26.171
Hi, Sabrina.

30:26.205 --> 30:28.640
Can you follow my light
with your eyes?

30:29.609 --> 30:30.875
Can you tell us what happened?

30:32.378 --> 30:34.713
I...

30:34.747 --> 30:36.248
I don't know.

30:36.282 --> 30:37.916
Do you remember
how the bookcase fell over?

30:37.950 --> 30:40.385
Someone pushed it onto me.

30:40.419 --> 30:41.586
Did you see who that was?

30:41.621 --> 30:43.555
No.

30:43.589 --> 30:44.856
I heard a voice.

30:44.890 --> 30:46.858
Was it a male
or a female voice?

30:47.893 --> 30:50.061
What did the voice say?

30:51.564 --> 30:55.533
"Thou shalt not suffer a witch
to live."

30:56.402 --> 30:58.003
She needs a cat scan.

31:02.942 --> 31:05.644
This bookcase weighs
hundreds of pounds.

31:05.678 --> 31:07.245
Somebody strong
must have pushed it on her.

31:07.280 --> 31:08.813
Question is, how'd they get in?

31:08.848 --> 31:11.583
Door was locked.
Police officers had to break in.

31:11.617 --> 31:13.685
Helen the witch
is burned alive.

31:13.719 --> 31:16.288
Sabrina almost gets
crushed to death.

31:16.322 --> 31:17.656
Maybe this is a witch-hunt.

31:17.690 --> 31:19.257
I think it's a
real estate hunt.

31:19.292 --> 31:20.659
Look what I found
by the cash register.

31:20.693 --> 31:22.160
Well, well, well.

31:22.194 --> 31:25.096
Our sleazebag real estate agent
stopped by.

31:25.131 --> 31:27.632
Well, you said Helen's will
divided her land evenly

31:27.667 --> 31:29.601
between the three
coven members.

31:29.635 --> 31:31.303
You think Cranston was trying to
get all three to sell?

31:31.337 --> 31:33.438
If he was,
my money's on Grayson.

31:33.472 --> 31:35.807
Sabrina and Sage don't pee
without his permission.

31:35.841 --> 31:38.343
He had the motive, the muscle,
and the keys to this place.

31:38.377 --> 31:40.779
Let's go find him.

31:40.813 --> 31:41.880
Hey. New guy.

31:41.914 --> 31:43.281
Boston police!

31:53.993 --> 31:55.327
Korsak.

32:08.425 --> 32:10.463
You're the only other one with
a key to the Spellbox.

32:10.583 --> 32:12.223
Where did you go
after the séance?

32:12.343 --> 32:15.150
No... no, it's not me.

32:15.184 --> 32:16.518
I didn't do this.

32:17.586 --> 32:21.523
I was in Needham
teaching a candle-making class.

32:21.557 --> 32:24.292
Sabrina's dead, isn't she?

32:24.327 --> 32:25.660
No.

32:25.695 --> 32:27.028
She's in the hospital.

32:27.063 --> 32:30.298
They're trying to kill us.

32:30.333 --> 32:35.136
It's as it was before...
Burning, pressing... drowning.

32:35.171 --> 32:36.938
All means of execution
for witches.

32:36.972 --> 32:38.073
There aren't any witches.

32:38.107 --> 32:40.742
I'm scared.

32:40.776 --> 32:43.011
I'm so scared.

32:43.045 --> 32:45.046
Real estate developer
has got a solid alibi.

32:45.081 --> 32:46.881
What about the reverend?

32:46.916 --> 32:49.584
Police officer says
he never left his house.

32:49.618 --> 32:52.554
We don't have enough
to hold her.

32:52.588 --> 32:53.988
You're free to go.

32:54.023 --> 32:55.323
No. No. Please.

32:55.358 --> 32:56.825
Can I please stay here?

32:56.859 --> 32:57.992
That's a first.

32:58.027 --> 32:59.994
Suspect who wants to spend
the night.

33:00.029 --> 33:02.030
I'm so afraid.
Please.

33:02.064 --> 33:05.266
Maybe we put her up in a hotel
until all this is over.

33:05.301 --> 33:06.835
What about my cats?

33:06.869 --> 33:09.037
Can't leave your cats.

33:09.905 --> 33:12.173
You live in Salem, right?

33:12.208 --> 33:13.875
We'll escort you home.

33:13.909 --> 33:16.111
We'll notify Salem police
to increase patrol presence

33:16.145 --> 33:18.413
- in your neighborhood.
- Thank you.

33:22.218 --> 33:25.019
What makes people put
all those holes in their heads

33:25.054 --> 33:26.654
and in their...
Ugh!

33:26.689 --> 33:28.590
Tongue and both nipples?

33:28.624 --> 33:30.592
It's nothing new, though.

33:30.626 --> 33:32.360
Roman Centurions
used to attach their capes

33:32.395 --> 33:33.695
to their nipple piercings.

33:33.729 --> 33:35.563
Okay.
That's good.

33:35.598 --> 33:38.400
Perimortem bruising
around his face,

33:38.434 --> 33:39.734
his neck, and his chest.

33:39.769 --> 33:41.636
- He was forcibly drowned?
- Yes.

33:41.670 --> 33:43.238
And there's skin and blood
under his fingernails.

33:43.272 --> 33:44.906
He's trying to loosen
his attacker's grip.

33:44.940 --> 33:47.142
We might have our killer's DNA.
I'll process it.

33:47.176 --> 33:49.611
Hey, you wouldn't happen to
have a solvent

33:49.645 --> 33:52.180
that will dissolve the glue
on Baretta's plastic claws, huh?

33:52.214 --> 33:55.016
Well, they're designed
to fall off eventually,

33:55.050 --> 33:57.786
but I can try slicing
the caps off with my scalpel.

33:57.820 --> 33:58.920
No!

33:58.954 --> 34:00.655
Well, I won't hurt him.

34:00.689 --> 34:02.490
Okay.

34:02.525 --> 34:04.526
I don't suppose anybody is gonna
adopt him with pink claws.

34:04.560 --> 34:06.761
Where is it, Maura?

34:06.796 --> 34:08.663
Where's the princess cup?

34:08.697 --> 34:10.864
I should go. W-well, let
me cut the caps off first.

34:10.900 --> 34:12.500
Never mind.
Pink's nice.

34:12.534 --> 34:14.502
I know Jane took Lily's cup.

34:14.536 --> 34:16.538
- Where is it?
- Don't be mad at Jane.

34:16.572 --> 34:18.005
She just did it
because she loves you.

34:18.040 --> 34:19.107
What's your excuse?

34:19.141 --> 34:22.010
Well, I have a bigger purse.

34:22.043 --> 34:26.581
And access
to superior paternity testing.

34:26.614 --> 34:28.483
Oh, yeah?
Well, guess what.

34:28.516 --> 34:30.952
I'm getting
my own paternity test.

34:30.985 --> 34:32.253
And if Lily turns out
to be mine,

34:32.288 --> 34:34.088
I-I'm gonna be the dad
that she deserves.

34:34.123 --> 34:36.558
And Janie's just gonna
have to accept it.

34:36.592 --> 34:38.059
That's very admirable, Frankie.

34:38.092 --> 34:41.696
Clearly, Theresa needs
a good guy like you in her life.

34:41.730 --> 34:43.598
Well, I'm never getting back
with Theresa.

34:43.632 --> 34:44.966
It's about Lily now.

34:45.000 --> 34:46.734
- Ma?
- Whoops.

34:46.768 --> 34:48.969
Oh, I must've gotten lost.

34:49.004 --> 34:50.871
Uh, what's that
behind your back?

34:50.906 --> 34:52.172
Nothing.

34:52.208 --> 34:54.708
Oh, Dr. Isles is working.
I'd better come back.

34:54.743 --> 34:56.143
- Hey. Oop.
- That's okay.

34:56.178 --> 34:58.546
I can still talk while I analyze
stomach contents.

34:58.581 --> 35:01.182
What's this in the bag?

35:02.651 --> 35:04.152
You got to be kidding me.

35:04.186 --> 35:07.188
I'm sorry, Frankie.
I have to know for your sake.

35:07.223 --> 35:09.157
I have to talk to Jane.

35:09.191 --> 35:11.926
Just got a breakthrough
in this case.

35:11.961 --> 35:14.863
But you're welcome to stay here
and finish this argument.

35:14.897 --> 35:16.931
Gee, thanks.

35:19.702 --> 35:21.169
Jane.

35:21.203 --> 35:24.138
Remember the figs that Sage
fed Grayson at the séance?

35:24.173 --> 35:26.608
Yes. Put me off of Fig Newtons
for life.

35:26.642 --> 35:28.109
They're still in his stomach.

35:28.143 --> 35:29.777
Signs of mastication,

35:29.812 --> 35:31.713
but very little enzymatic
or acid activity.

35:31.747 --> 35:35.016
So... he was dead
before they had time to digest.

35:35.050 --> 35:37.151
Well, the séance
was at 6:00.

35:37.186 --> 35:38.853
The figs were in his stomach

35:38.888 --> 35:40.688
for no longer than an hour
before he was killed.

35:40.723 --> 35:43.958
You're saying Grayson was killed
before Sabrina was attacked.

35:43.993 --> 35:46.961
Yes. And you found skin and
blood under his fingernails.

35:46.996 --> 35:48.196
- DNA back?
- Not yet.

35:48.230 --> 35:50.031
Our killer will have
defensive wounds.

35:50.065 --> 35:52.800
Well, it wasn't Sage.
She didn't have a mark on her.

35:53.802 --> 35:55.570
Frost, can you pull up a picture
of Sabrina?

35:55.604 --> 35:58.206
Sabrina had abrasions
on her face.

35:58.240 --> 36:01.209
Yeah, but I didn't see her arms.
She was wearing long sleeves.

36:01.243 --> 36:03.545
I got crime-scene photos
from Salem P.D.

36:03.579 --> 36:05.046
Look at Sabrina's hands.

36:05.080 --> 36:08.216
Okay. Could those gouges be
from Grayson's fingernails?

36:08.250 --> 36:10.084
It's possible.

36:10.119 --> 36:12.587
So Sabrina...
could've killed Grayson

36:12.621 --> 36:15.957
and then staged her own attack
at the Spellbox.

36:15.991 --> 36:18.593
How?
Grayson was held underwater.

36:18.627 --> 36:21.162
Yeah, and those bookshelves
weighed hundreds of pounds.

36:21.196 --> 36:22.997
Crime-lab results are back

36:23.032 --> 36:24.766
from the blood in the bowl
at the altar.

36:24.800 --> 36:26.801
All right, Helen's attempt
at a healing spell...

36:26.835 --> 36:28.069
who was she trying to heal?

36:28.103 --> 36:30.204
Sabrina's blood
was in the bowl.

36:30.239 --> 36:31.873
Anything in Sabrina's
tox screen?

36:31.907 --> 36:34.208
I mean, drugs could explain
the superhuman strength.

36:34.243 --> 36:36.611
If she was on PCP,
that would explain it.

36:36.645 --> 36:38.613
No.
There's no drugs in her system.

36:38.647 --> 36:40.114
Well, something was wrong
with Sabrina.

36:40.149 --> 36:42.917
Because Helen was trying
to heal her.

36:42.952 --> 36:44.052
Yeah.

36:44.086 --> 36:45.820
Jane, I think you're right.

36:46.956 --> 36:50.291
Sabrina's DNA results show
that chromosome 8 and 13

36:50.326 --> 36:54.596
are at 8p22-p21 and 13q.

36:54.630 --> 36:56.798
Later that same day...

36:56.832 --> 36:59.467
Many of those
accused of witchcraft

36:59.501 --> 37:01.002
were suffering
from mental disorders.

37:01.036 --> 37:03.638
No! You mean they weren't
really witches?

37:03.672 --> 37:06.841
Sabrina Scott was descended
from Sarah Good.

37:06.875 --> 37:09.677
Yes, who was one of the first
women put to death in Salem.

37:09.712 --> 37:12.647
And Sarah Good was probably
suffering from schizophrenia.

37:12.681 --> 37:14.816
Which can be inherited, right?

37:14.850 --> 37:17.418
Yes. And it usually strikes
in early adulthood.

37:17.453 --> 37:20.688
It's characterized
by hallucinations,

37:20.723 --> 37:22.857
delusions, bizarre behavior.

37:22.891 --> 37:25.693
Oh, God. Like...
like thinking you're a witch.

37:25.728 --> 37:27.962
Sabrina does have the genetic
markers for the disease.

37:27.997 --> 37:29.697
You know,
I've arrested schizophrenics

37:29.732 --> 37:31.065
in the middle
of a psychotic break.

37:31.100 --> 37:34.235
They are crazy strong and...
and out of control,

37:34.269 --> 37:35.703
like being on PCP.

37:35.738 --> 37:38.139
Hi. Yeah.
This is detective Jane Rizzoli.

37:38.173 --> 37:41.709
I need to put a security detail
on Sabrina Scott, please.

37:41.744 --> 37:44.012
W-when?

37:44.046 --> 37:45.046
Okay.

37:45.080 --> 37:46.781
Thank you.

37:46.815 --> 37:48.783
Sabrina checked out
of the hospital A.M.A.

37:48.817 --> 37:50.318
Against medical advice?

37:51.320 --> 37:54.656
We got to find Sabrina
before she gets to Sage.

37:57.663 --> 37:59.605
All right, Korsak.
Thanks a lot.

37:59.725 --> 38:01.898
Sabrina's not at her apartment,
she's not at the store,

38:01.932 --> 38:03.633
- and she's not at her father's house.
- All right.

38:03.667 --> 38:05.968
That was Salem police.
They can't find Sage either.

38:06.003 --> 38:07.703
Well, Sabrina's taken out
two members of her coven.

38:07.738 --> 38:09.405
She's not gonna stop
until she finds Sage.

38:09.440 --> 38:10.873
Think, guys.
Where would she be?

38:10.908 --> 38:12.809
Well, what probably caused
her schizophrenic break

38:12.843 --> 38:15.545
is this conflict between
her adoption of witchcraft

38:15.579 --> 38:17.580
and her religious upbringing.

38:17.614 --> 38:19.482
Okay.
That's a "why," not a "where."

38:19.516 --> 38:22.485
She heard scripture
during her attack at the store.

38:22.519 --> 38:23.853
That's it.

38:23.887 --> 38:25.755
The voices in her head
are telling her to go back

38:25.789 --> 38:27.557
to her old faith.

38:35.566 --> 38:38.701
<i>Thou shalt not suffer
a witch to live.</i>

38:41.405 --> 38:43.239
<i>Kill
her. Evil shall be punished.</i>

38:43.273 --> 38:46.008
<i>Do it!
Evil must be destroyed.</i>

38:47.711 --> 38:49.045
Sabrina, stop!

38:49.079 --> 38:51.848
Stop.
Put the gas can down, okay?

38:51.882 --> 38:53.850
No!
Do not try to stop me.

38:53.884 --> 38:55.651
We must die by fire.

38:55.686 --> 38:57.887
Put the torch down, all right?
You don't have to do this.

38:57.921 --> 38:59.422
All she perceives is a threat.

38:59.456 --> 39:01.357
She's in the middle
of a psychotic break.

39:01.391 --> 39:02.825
I'm not gonna let her
kill Sage.

39:02.860 --> 39:05.728
Distract her.
Talk to her.

39:05.762 --> 39:07.063
Sabrina?

39:07.097 --> 39:08.331
Sabrina?

39:08.365 --> 39:09.632
<i>Death to witches.</i>

39:09.666 --> 39:11.734
Don't think that you need to
punish Sage

39:11.768 --> 39:12.935
the way that you punished
Helen.

39:12.970 --> 39:15.605
Helen was a devil worshiper!

39:15.639 --> 39:18.040
Grayson worshiped Satan.

39:18.075 --> 39:20.610
They were the dark ones...
Witches.

39:20.644 --> 39:22.745
- <i>She must die.
- Die.</i>

39:22.779 --> 39:24.580
Sage is evil.

39:24.615 --> 39:25.982
A devil worshiper!

39:26.016 --> 39:28.317
- She must die.
- No. Sabrina...

39:28.352 --> 39:30.520
- Yes! She is!
- No. You aren't evil.

39:30.554 --> 39:31.921
Die.

39:31.955 --> 39:33.856
Sabrina!

39:41.298 --> 39:42.632
Please help me.

39:42.666 --> 39:44.300
I have sinned!

39:44.334 --> 39:45.635
It's okay.

39:46.937 --> 39:50.606
It's all right. It's all right.
It's all right.

39:56.146 --> 39:58.848
Poor Sabrina.

39:58.882 --> 40:00.616
They took her to Bridgewater.

40:00.651 --> 40:02.952
At least doctors there
will keep her stabilized,

40:02.986 --> 40:05.054
keep her from having
psychotic episodes.

40:05.088 --> 40:06.589
It was sad.

40:06.623 --> 40:07.690
Yeah.

40:07.724 --> 40:09.392
Schizophrenia
is a terrible illness.

40:09.426 --> 40:10.793
Better than being burned
at the stake

40:10.827 --> 40:12.495
or drowned in your bathtub.

40:13.497 --> 40:15.031
What the hell happened to you?

40:15.065 --> 40:16.032
Nothing.

40:16.066 --> 40:17.733
Those look like cat scratches.

40:17.768 --> 40:20.570
Baretta got a little uptight
when I took the caps off.

40:20.604 --> 40:23.005
Oh, the sweetest cat
in the world?

40:24.708 --> 40:26.409
How many stitches,
Ace Ventura?

40:26.443 --> 40:28.678
- Six.
- Ow.

40:28.712 --> 40:30.246
Didn't hurt.

40:31.415 --> 40:33.950
What you eating?
Humble pie?

40:34.851 --> 40:36.852
I deserve that.

40:38.355 --> 40:41.757
I'm sorry, okay?
I'm a jerk.

40:41.792 --> 40:43.392
Yeah, you are.

40:43.427 --> 40:45.895
Lily's a...
she's a nice girl.

40:45.929 --> 40:47.597
And I'm gonna be a great aunt,
okay?

40:47.631 --> 40:48.564
I promise.

40:48.599 --> 40:50.833
Nope.
You won't be.

40:51.768 --> 40:53.002
Got the paternity test back.

40:53.036 --> 40:55.638
Lily's not my daughter.

40:56.707 --> 40:57.974
I'm sorry, Frankie.

40:58.008 --> 40:59.809
Yeah.
You know what?

40:59.843 --> 41:01.010
So am I.

41:01.044 --> 41:03.746
You'll make a really
good father someday.

41:03.780 --> 41:05.848
Yeah. Someday.

41:05.882 --> 41:08.050
That's too bad.

41:08.085 --> 41:10.720
I was really looking forward
to holidays with Theresa.

41:13.657 --> 41:14.957
What are we gonna do about ma?

41:16.026 --> 41:18.094
She like cats? Oh, don't
even think about it.

41:18.128 --> 41:19.962
Baretta is very sweet.

41:19.997 --> 41:21.330
Okay.
It's your house.

41:21.365 --> 41:22.598
Come here.
Sit down.

41:22.633 --> 41:24.100
Let me buy you a beer.

41:26.637 --> 41:27.703
Love you.
