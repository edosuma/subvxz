WEBVTT

00:07.908 --> 00:09.277
I'm writing Darlene a letter.

00:09.310 --> 00:11.412
I've called her five times today
and she hasn't called me back.

00:11.445 --> 00:12.746
Oh, that's nice.

00:12.780 --> 00:15.649
Listen, when you're done, would
you go to the store for me

00:15.683 --> 00:17.985
and get me some milk and
bread and peanut butter?

00:18.018 --> 00:21.155
Oh, yeah, and if they have
any left, uh, get a life.

00:24.258 --> 00:25.926
I have a life.

00:25.959 --> 00:27.228
No you don't.

00:27.261 --> 00:28.962
All you do is just
sit here on the couch.

00:28.996 --> 00:30.464
You never get any exercise.

00:30.498 --> 00:32.966
You just eat and sleep,
which would be fine if we

00:33.000 --> 00:34.135
were raising you for veal.

00:37.538 --> 00:39.173
It's just that right
now I'm having a really

00:39.207 --> 00:40.174
hard time with Darlene.

00:40.208 --> 00:41.442
No, no.

00:41.475 --> 00:44.178
Right now you're having a
really hard time with me.

00:44.212 --> 00:45.679
I want you to be like
a normal kid, you know.

00:45.713 --> 00:47.148
Get out there and start
doing all the things

00:47.181 --> 00:49.049
that your peers are
pressuring you into doing.

00:51.952 --> 00:53.053
OK, I promise.

00:53.087 --> 00:55.055
But right now I have to
straighten out Darlene.

00:55.089 --> 00:56.857
It's kind of personal,
if you don't mind.

00:56.890 --> 00:57.958
No, I don't mind.

01:02.230 --> 01:05.499
"Dear Darlene, I
really, really miss you.

01:05.533 --> 01:08.469
It really, really hurts
me when you don't call.

01:08.502 --> 01:12.072
I know you're very busy,
but if you don't mind"--

01:12.106 --> 01:13.974
See, I was going to get
really tough after that.

01:17.311 --> 01:19.547
I was tougher than
this in my wedding vows.

01:23.083 --> 01:26.086
OK, here, David, take this down.

01:26.120 --> 01:27.355
All right.

01:27.388 --> 01:30.424
"Dear Darlene, I am
tired of your crap.

01:33.994 --> 01:39.800
You are selfish, moody, and
most of all, ungrateful."

01:39.833 --> 01:41.602
She's not ungrateful.

01:41.635 --> 01:43.103
Trust me, I've known
her longer than you.

01:45.639 --> 01:47.040
And then you gotta
finish up with something

01:47.074 --> 01:49.743
that'll really, really get her.

01:49.777 --> 01:50.911
I could tell
she's just like you.

01:50.944 --> 01:51.745
That'll kill her.

01:56.517 --> 01:59.987
Both of us with the one shot.

02:00.020 --> 02:02.556
Guess who I found
at the train station.

02:02.590 --> 02:03.491
Darlene, hi.

02:03.524 --> 02:04.858
Wow, what are you doing here?

02:04.892 --> 02:08.262
Mrs. Conner thought it'd
be fun to surprise you.

02:08.296 --> 02:09.897
Darlene, we
really, really miss

02:09.930 --> 02:11.865
you and it really
makes us feel really,

02:11.899 --> 02:14.435
really bad when you don't call.

02:14.468 --> 02:15.269
Thanks for coming.

02:18.272 --> 02:19.207
Hey, Darlene.

02:19.240 --> 02:22.910
She's not moving
back here, is she?

02:22.943 --> 02:27.215
No, we would never let David's
girlfriend move into the house.

02:27.248 --> 02:28.482
Good.

02:28.516 --> 02:30.418
Uh, David, would you come
help me put my stuff away?

02:30.451 --> 02:31.285
Yeah, I'll be right there.

02:34.322 --> 02:35.356
Umph.

02:35.389 --> 02:36.924
Mrs. Conner, can I
have that back, please?

02:36.957 --> 02:37.825
No.

02:37.858 --> 02:39.627
No, David, I'm afraid not.

02:39.660 --> 02:43.531
Because you see, I own you now.

02:43.564 --> 02:45.098
What do you want from me?

02:45.132 --> 02:46.834
I just want you keep
your promise, you know.

02:46.867 --> 02:49.370
Get out in the world, quit
laying there on the couch,

02:49.403 --> 02:52.072
because Dan and I might not
always be there to turn you

02:52.105 --> 02:52.906
every half hour.

02:56.710 --> 02:58.078
OK.

02:58.111 --> 03:01.215
And I want you to start
sticking up for yourself

03:01.249 --> 03:02.316
around Darlene, you know.

03:02.350 --> 03:04.485
Don't let her push you
around all the time.

03:04.518 --> 03:06.854
DARLENE: David,
come help me unpack.

03:06.887 --> 03:07.755
No.

03:07.788 --> 03:10.958
No, I can't help you.

03:10.991 --> 03:13.361
[theme music]

03:52.300 --> 03:54.268
[laughing]

03:54.302 --> 03:56.704
[music playing]

04:01.309 --> 04:02.876
What are you doing downstairs?

04:02.910 --> 04:04.412
What's the matter
with your bathroom?

04:04.445 --> 04:07.114
Oh, DJ's been in
there for like an hour.

04:07.147 --> 04:08.649
Boy, he's just like you, Dan.

04:08.682 --> 04:10.351
Why don't you run a
newspaper up to him?

04:14.121 --> 04:17.257
He's got the door locked, and
it's like the third time today.

04:17.291 --> 04:18.959
Maybe I ought to go up there.

04:18.992 --> 04:20.394
Trust me, I don't
think this is a time

04:20.428 --> 04:21.495
that a boy needs his mother.

04:27.134 --> 04:28.268
What are you talking about?

04:28.302 --> 04:32.640
Um, I think I know
what she's talking about.

04:32.673 --> 04:35.376
And I think you know
what she's talking about,

04:35.409 --> 04:38.712
if you just think
about it for a minute.

04:38.746 --> 04:41.248
Yeah, DJ's finally got a
friend that's not imaginary.

04:48.221 --> 04:49.590
Oh, my god.

04:52.660 --> 04:55.228
You don't know.

04:55.262 --> 04:57.164
He could just be
brushing his teeth

04:57.197 --> 05:00.801
or, you know, maybe he's
compulsively washing his hands,

05:00.834 --> 05:03.437
or uh, maybe it's
something totally

05:03.471 --> 05:05.305
harmless like chronic diarrhea.

05:08.041 --> 05:09.510
Trust me, he goes in
that room because it's

05:09.543 --> 05:10.978
the only one with a lock on it.

05:11.011 --> 05:13.347
And he's in there for like an
hour at a time, which either

05:13.381 --> 05:16.517
means he's really,
really good at it,

05:16.550 --> 05:18.719
or really, really bad at it.

05:18.752 --> 05:20.153
Oh, my god.

05:26.694 --> 05:28.629
Well, I don't want you to
give him any grief about this,

05:28.662 --> 05:29.897
you know, because
you could traumatize

05:29.930 --> 05:33.901
him and turn him into a
serial killer or something.

05:33.934 --> 05:35.102
Well, don't worry.

05:35.135 --> 05:36.970
How much damage can you do
with only one free hand?

05:44.378 --> 05:48.516
You know, guys, it doesn't
have to be a bad thing.

05:48.549 --> 05:49.483
Very natural.

05:49.517 --> 05:52.986
It's not like we
all didn't do it.

05:53.020 --> 05:54.087
- Oh, my god.
- Get outta here.

05:54.121 --> 05:54.922
I'm going.

06:02.162 --> 06:05.198
He's too young for
this, isn't he, Dan?

06:05.232 --> 06:06.033
Maybe he's gifted.

06:14.241 --> 06:16.644
But lookit, he
still drinks his juice

06:16.677 --> 06:20.147
out of a little Batman cup.

06:20.180 --> 06:22.583
He's my baby.

06:22.616 --> 06:24.685
Well, from now on,
when your baby's bad,

06:24.718 --> 06:26.319
I guess we can't send
him up to his room.

06:29.923 --> 06:30.924
ROSEANNE: Wow.

06:30.958 --> 06:32.693
We ought to be able
to handle this OK.

06:32.726 --> 06:37.598
I mean, you know, it's
just masturbation.

06:37.631 --> 06:40.000
[music playing]

06:42.603 --> 06:43.937
That's great about
your short story.

06:43.971 --> 06:45.606
Why didn't you tell
me you got an A?

06:45.639 --> 06:46.574
Never seen one before.

06:46.607 --> 06:48.876
I didn't know what it was.

06:48.909 --> 06:51.044
Darlene, you don't have to
hold back all the good stuff

06:51.078 --> 06:52.345
that's happening to you.

06:52.379 --> 06:54.615
Good stuff's
happening to me, too.

06:54.648 --> 06:55.783
Really?

06:55.816 --> 06:56.750
I mean, that's great.

06:56.784 --> 06:59.352
Like what?

06:59.386 --> 07:01.922
Well, I got some As.

07:01.955 --> 07:03.156
You did?

07:03.190 --> 07:06.159
Yeah, I got to an A in
art, in history, and--

07:06.193 --> 07:07.394
and gym.

07:07.427 --> 07:09.597
And I got a B in social studies.

07:09.630 --> 07:11.565
I got a B-plus in English.

07:11.599 --> 07:15.536
I got a B in math, I got
a B-minus in biology,

07:15.569 --> 07:20.908
I got a B in music
and a B in geometry.

07:20.941 --> 07:22.576
Geez, David, how many
classes are you taking?

07:25.679 --> 07:26.580
A lot.

07:26.614 --> 07:29.550
I'm really into
school this year.

07:29.583 --> 07:30.951
As a matter of fact,
I'm going to be doing

07:30.984 --> 07:32.953
some art for the yearbook, too.

07:32.986 --> 07:35.088
Whoa, you must be really busy.

07:35.122 --> 07:36.857
Sounds like you're
doing really great.

07:36.890 --> 07:38.726
Yeah.

07:38.759 --> 07:39.993
It's so great to see you.

07:43.864 --> 07:46.700
Hey, David.

07:46.734 --> 07:49.302
What the hell's going on?
- What do you mean?

07:49.336 --> 07:51.371
Well, your math teacher
came by the restaurant

07:51.404 --> 07:54.107
today and says you haven't
been in school for two weeks.

07:54.141 --> 07:56.644
What you been doing?

07:56.677 --> 07:58.946
Nothing.

07:58.979 --> 08:01.615
Well, you know, if you want
to mope around this house

08:01.649 --> 08:04.451
all depressed and down, there's
nothing I can do about it.

08:04.484 --> 08:06.620
But I'm damn sure not gonna
let you drop out of school

08:06.654 --> 08:08.689
and screw up your life like
you're one of my own kids.

08:11.692 --> 08:13.460
I'll start going and
I'll make up the work.

08:13.493 --> 08:14.695
Yeah, you bet you will.

08:14.728 --> 08:16.664
And there'll be somebody
standing over your shoulder

08:16.697 --> 08:18.065
to make sure that you do that.

08:18.098 --> 08:20.634
So you better hope that Dan
doesn't nod off and crush you.

08:26.039 --> 08:27.908
OK, I'll do it.

08:27.941 --> 08:31.211
David.
I lied, OK?

08:35.649 --> 08:37.785
I can't believe you just
embarrassed him like that.

08:37.818 --> 08:39.787
He didn't want me to know
he was skipping school.

08:39.820 --> 08:43.557
Oh, yeah, I know how strict
you are on that kind of thing.

08:43.591 --> 08:46.459
Well, he just got done
telling me how happy he is.

08:46.493 --> 08:47.928
And you bought that?

08:47.961 --> 08:49.763
No, but at least I didn't
throw it back in his face

08:49.797 --> 08:51.799
and humiliate him.

08:51.832 --> 08:54.635
Yeah, I have to do
everything around here.

08:54.668 --> 08:57.037
[music playing]

08:58.138 --> 09:01.074
ROSEANNE: (YELLING)
Dinner's ready.

09:01.108 --> 09:05.045
DJ, did you wash your hands?

09:05.078 --> 09:08.816
God, I hope so.

09:08.849 --> 09:10.283
So, what happened, DJ?

09:10.317 --> 09:11.985
I thought you were going
to eat over at your friend

09:12.019 --> 09:13.253
George's house.

09:13.286 --> 09:15.522
I got mad at him, so I
came and played by myself.

09:18.358 --> 09:19.793
Count to 10.

09:23.764 --> 09:25.733
Jackie said you had a story
published in the school's

09:25.766 --> 09:27.034
literary journal.

09:27.067 --> 09:27.968
Yeah.

09:28.001 --> 09:29.202
So what happens in it?

09:29.236 --> 09:30.671
Oh, it's non-narrative.

09:30.704 --> 09:32.706
Nothing happens.

09:32.740 --> 09:35.508
Look, I don't
think you'd get it.

09:35.542 --> 09:37.645
Uh, well, gee,
Darlene, don't you

09:37.678 --> 09:39.813
be ashamed-a showin' your
brain 'round me 'n' Pa.

09:42.650 --> 09:47.788
Every mama dreams of the day
her young-un'll out-learn 'er.

09:47.821 --> 09:51.324
'Course, we was never
much fer yer books 'n' such.

09:53.961 --> 09:55.162
All right, fine.

09:55.195 --> 09:57.130
The story is from the point
of view of an old woman.

09:57.164 --> 10:01.434
And she's looking at a picture
of herself when she was a kid.

10:01.468 --> 10:02.970
Never mind, you can read it.

10:03.003 --> 10:03.937
What are you talking about?

10:03.971 --> 10:05.072
Nothing.

10:05.105 --> 10:06.740
Hey, getting your story
published isn't nothing.

10:06.774 --> 10:07.841
Just drop it, Dan.

10:07.875 --> 10:09.109
Your story's
getting published?

10:09.142 --> 10:10.243
Where?

10:10.277 --> 10:11.645
In the school journal,
but it's no big deal.

10:11.679 --> 10:13.413
It's just because I'm
friends with the editor.

10:13.446 --> 10:14.614
Well, I've got an idea.

10:14.648 --> 10:17.450
Uh, let's talk
about DJ's school.

10:17.484 --> 10:18.652
Yeah, I hear he
got caught playing

10:18.686 --> 10:19.820
with this instrument in band.

10:24.758 --> 10:26.293
I'm not in band, stupid.

10:31.298 --> 10:32.733
OK, next subject.

10:32.766 --> 10:36.336
Dan, how was work?

10:36.369 --> 10:39.539
Well, today was a
special one for me.

10:39.572 --> 10:43.010
It was 179th day in a row where
I did exactly the same thing.

10:53.486 --> 10:55.155
Well, DJ over here
is well on his way

10:55.188 --> 10:56.156
to shattering that record.

11:04.765 --> 11:07.034
I want to hear more
about how great school is.

11:07.067 --> 11:08.836
I don't want to
talk about school.

11:08.869 --> 11:10.904
What's the matter, you
don't think I can take it?

11:10.938 --> 11:13.807
Tell us about the
old lady in the story.

11:13.841 --> 11:17.577
I would, uh, like to talk
about, uh, Jackie's pregnancy.

11:17.610 --> 11:19.279
Yeah, let's talk about
Jackie's pregnancy.

11:19.312 --> 11:20.814
Yeah.

11:20.848 --> 11:22.382
Well, she has to go to
the bathroom a lot now,

11:22.415 --> 11:26.353
because, uh, you know, right
now the, uh, fetus is-- it's

11:26.386 --> 11:27.587
really pressing on the bladder.

11:31.491 --> 11:34.862
Well, that would
explain the glow.

11:34.895 --> 11:37.297
I don't understand why nobody
wants to talk about Darlene.

11:37.330 --> 11:39.332
I mean, nothing's
happening in our lives.

11:39.366 --> 11:41.568
She's at least doing stuff.

11:41.601 --> 11:43.103
I mean, she didn't do
anything in high school.

11:43.136 --> 11:44.071
All she did was hang out with--

11:48.075 --> 11:50.277
Boy, you sure are
a quick one, Pa.

11:53.580 --> 11:55.082
Who told you I
got caught playing

11:55.115 --> 11:56.249
with my instrument in band?

12:01.188 --> 12:05.625
So, it's pressing right
up against the bladder, huh?

12:05.658 --> 12:08.028
[music playing]

12:14.001 --> 12:16.436
Gee, Dan, I hate this.

12:16.469 --> 12:19.039
Can't we keep him a little
boy a little bit longer?

12:19.072 --> 12:22.876
Put him in a freezer and just
take him out on the holidays?

12:22.910 --> 12:24.211
Freezer's full, hon.

12:24.244 --> 12:26.713
Let's just put this lock
on and get outta here.

12:26.746 --> 12:29.516
Oh, look at his
little dinosaur sheets.

12:32.452 --> 12:33.253
Aw.

12:35.923 --> 12:36.723
Oh, no.

12:41.261 --> 12:42.896
Oh, he's using my "Cosmo."

12:49.102 --> 12:50.904
That makes me like his dealer.

12:54.507 --> 12:56.276
Hey, and a "Montgomery
Ward" catalog,

12:56.309 --> 12:58.846
opened to the
Young Miss section.

12:58.879 --> 13:00.447
A resourceful young lad.

13:03.917 --> 13:05.819
DJ.

13:05.853 --> 13:08.455
Whoa, Roseanne, I
was sleepwalking again.

13:08.488 --> 13:09.289
What are we doing up here?

13:13.593 --> 13:14.394
Think he bought it?

13:18.331 --> 13:20.600
[music playing]

13:23.603 --> 13:24.905
I can't, Roseanne.

13:24.938 --> 13:28.575
Well, didn't you ever have
this talk with your parents?

13:28.608 --> 13:29.709
Yeah.

13:29.742 --> 13:32.645
My mom said, [knocking]
you all right in there?

13:32.679 --> 13:37.317
And I said, I'll be right out.

13:37.350 --> 13:39.052
Well, he thinks we're
spying on him, Dan.

13:39.086 --> 13:41.088
So he thinks he's
doing something bad.

13:41.121 --> 13:43.323
You want him to think that, Dan?

13:43.356 --> 13:44.858
Dan?

13:44.892 --> 13:46.426
Why me?

13:46.459 --> 13:48.962
Because it's your turn.

13:48.996 --> 13:50.597
I talked to the girls after
they got their periods.

13:53.400 --> 13:55.135
I talked to the girls
after they got their periods.

13:55.168 --> 13:58.105
I mean I talked to the
girls about their periods.

14:03.343 --> 14:05.445
All right, I'll do it.

14:05.478 --> 14:06.579
Good.

14:06.613 --> 14:08.515
And you know, Dan, if
you handle it right,

14:08.548 --> 14:11.184
then maybe he will
come to us and feel

14:11.218 --> 14:17.090
comfortable later if he has, you
know, any questions about sex.

14:17.124 --> 14:17.958
And that would be good?

14:21.494 --> 14:23.596
I don't even know why
I bother to come home.

14:23.630 --> 14:24.597
I don't know why, either.

14:24.631 --> 14:25.966
You can feel sorry
for me in Chicago.

14:25.999 --> 14:27.167
[slam]

14:27.200 --> 14:28.301
You know what, David?

14:28.335 --> 14:29.669
If it'll make you happy,
I'll try not to think

14:29.702 --> 14:31.138
about you at all in Chicago.

14:31.171 --> 14:32.505
[sigh]

14:34.574 --> 14:39.879
Ah, to be young and in love.

14:39.913 --> 14:41.214
Well, I'll handle this one.

14:41.248 --> 14:43.316
You-- you go find DJ.
- Oh, man.

14:53.260 --> 14:54.894
So, uh, David, you
want to tell me what you

14:54.928 --> 14:57.397
and Darlene are fighting about?

14:57.430 --> 14:59.799
Not really.

14:59.832 --> 15:02.069
Well, don't you want to
hear what I have to say?

15:05.105 --> 15:06.039
Sure, I'll have a seat.

15:10.543 --> 15:12.745
You know, David, I think
that someplace in your head

15:12.779 --> 15:15.548
you think Darlene's going
to start hating school

15:15.582 --> 15:18.551
and come back home, but
that's not gonna happen.

15:18.585 --> 15:19.452
She's happy there.

15:23.356 --> 15:25.092
David, are you listening to me?

15:28.128 --> 15:30.897
You can't depend on Darlene
for your happiness, you know.

15:30.930 --> 15:32.565
You've gotta get out there
and find out what it is

15:32.599 --> 15:34.501
you really want to do in life.

15:34.534 --> 15:39.672
Make sure it doesn't annoy
me, and then go for it.

15:44.077 --> 15:47.680
I have no idea how to
communicate with a kid

15:47.714 --> 15:48.881
that doesn't yell back.

15:51.818 --> 15:56.056
Don't you have anything
obnoxious to say?

15:56.089 --> 15:58.491
[music on tv]

15:58.525 --> 15:59.392
Well, that's a start.

16:06.299 --> 16:07.667
[sigh] Hey.

16:13.573 --> 16:14.974
Um, don't mind me.

16:15.008 --> 16:18.545
I was just gonna get something.

16:18.578 --> 16:19.379
Ah.

16:24.451 --> 16:25.785
Hey, Deej?

16:25.818 --> 16:29.556
Um, I think that you and me
need to talk about some stuff.

16:29.589 --> 16:33.626
I'm just-- I'm just not--

16:33.660 --> 16:38.331
it's just-- [sigh] what
I'm trying to say is, look,

16:38.365 --> 16:42.435
is there anything you
feel like asking me about?

16:42.469 --> 16:43.336
No.

16:43.370 --> 16:44.237
Good.

16:44.271 --> 16:45.238
Good.

16:45.272 --> 16:47.507
Very good.

16:47.540 --> 16:49.442
Great.

16:49.476 --> 16:54.747
[sigh] OK, look, DJ.

16:59.719 --> 17:03.323
Look, buddy, I know you're
really embarrassed right now.

17:03.356 --> 17:07.060
I just want you to know
that what you've been doing,

17:07.094 --> 17:09.529
it's just a part of growing up.

17:09.562 --> 17:10.697
So you're proud of me?

17:14.667 --> 17:17.003
Well, yeah, but not for this.

17:17.036 --> 17:21.074
Um, the point is, I'm
not upset with you.

17:21.108 --> 17:23.276
This is something
that everybody does.

17:23.310 --> 17:25.345
- Really?
- Yeah.

17:25.378 --> 17:26.246
OK.

17:26.279 --> 17:27.080
OK.

17:30.049 --> 17:31.718
[sigh]

17:31.751 --> 17:32.752
Do you do it?

17:41.094 --> 17:43.763
Like I said, Deej,
everybody does it.

17:43.796 --> 17:44.697
How much do you do it?

17:49.869 --> 17:51.904
Look, Deej, the
funny thing about this

17:51.938 --> 17:55.275
is that even though it's
OK and everybody does it,

17:55.308 --> 17:58.311
there's nothing wrong
with it, nobody ever,

17:58.345 --> 17:59.412
ever talks about it.

18:02.415 --> 18:04.751
[music playing]

18:12.091 --> 18:13.226
Let's go, Darlene.

18:13.260 --> 18:14.761
This bus is moving out.

18:14.794 --> 18:18.298
Oh, by the way, DJ asked me
to bring over my back issues

18:18.331 --> 18:21.401
of "Mademoiselle."

18:21.434 --> 18:22.769
Says it's for some
school project.

18:25.538 --> 18:29.142
It's more like a home project.

18:29.176 --> 18:30.009
No need to send them back.

18:34.547 --> 18:36.115
- This is really great.
- Yeah.

18:36.149 --> 18:37.016
I'm gonna miss you.

18:37.049 --> 18:38.285
[kiss]

18:38.318 --> 18:39.886
Well, I'll call you as
soon as I get back to school.

18:39.919 --> 18:40.787
If you have the time.

18:40.820 --> 18:41.921
No pressure.

18:41.954 --> 18:43.055
Hm.

18:43.089 --> 18:44.757
Well, call me as soon as
you get there, no matter

18:44.791 --> 18:45.758
if you have the time or not.

18:45.792 --> 18:47.894
Big pressure.

18:47.927 --> 18:48.795
Hey.

18:48.828 --> 18:49.796
Need any money?

18:49.829 --> 18:50.697
Yeah!

18:50.730 --> 18:53.633
Me too.

18:53.666 --> 18:56.303
Have a safe trip.

18:56.336 --> 18:58.171
(YELLING) DJ,
Darlene's leaving.

18:58.205 --> 19:00.773
DJ: (YELLING) Good!

19:00.807 --> 19:03.276
DARLENE: Bye.

19:03.310 --> 19:04.744
[door slams]

19:04.777 --> 19:09.316
Well, David, it looks like
you and Darlene patched up,

19:09.349 --> 19:12.985
uh, your problems after
that little talk we had.

19:13.019 --> 19:13.986
No, no, no.

19:14.020 --> 19:17.890
Your happiness is thanks enough.

19:17.924 --> 19:20.092
I was thinking about what
you said to me about my not

19:20.126 --> 19:22.662
being happy and that I
should do something about it.

19:22.695 --> 19:23.963
Wow.

19:23.996 --> 19:26.299
You really listen to me?

19:26.333 --> 19:30.670
You are getting
weirder and weirder.

19:30.703 --> 19:33.005
I talked to my mom
in Michigan last night

19:33.039 --> 19:35.074
and I told her I'm going
to go live with her.

19:35.107 --> 19:36.075
What?

19:36.108 --> 19:37.810
I didn't mean that
you had to leave.

19:37.844 --> 19:38.711
I know.

19:38.745 --> 19:39.746
You've been great to me.

19:39.779 --> 19:41.147
But as long as I
live here, I'm just

19:41.180 --> 19:43.583
gonna be dependent on Darlene.

19:43.616 --> 19:45.518
Yeah, but I mean, you
can't go back there, David.

19:45.552 --> 19:49.021
You remember how mean
your mom was to ya?

19:49.055 --> 19:50.590
Well, she's trying to change.

19:50.623 --> 19:53.226
Well, she says she's
trying to change.

19:53.260 --> 19:54.126
Honey.

19:54.160 --> 19:57.129
Don't "Honey" me, Dan.

19:57.163 --> 19:58.565
Does Darlene know about this?

19:58.598 --> 20:00.700
No, I was gonna call her
as soon as I got to Michigan.

20:00.733 --> 20:02.835
If I told her now, she'd just
try to talk me out of it.

20:02.869 --> 20:05.238
Oh, well, sure she would,
because she cares about you.

20:05.272 --> 20:06.839
She doesn't want to see
you screw up your life.

20:06.873 --> 20:07.907
That's enough, Roseanne.

20:07.940 --> 20:09.842
No, Dan, that is not enough.

20:09.876 --> 20:12.979
It's not enough till
he changes his mind.

20:13.012 --> 20:14.113
I didn't mean to make you mad.

20:14.146 --> 20:15.548
I just can't stay here.

20:15.582 --> 20:19.151
Well, you know you'll always
have a home if you need one.

20:19.185 --> 20:19.986
Thanks.

20:25.024 --> 20:27.594
Well, what'd ya
make him leave for?

20:27.627 --> 20:29.829
We can't stop him from
going back to his mom.

20:29.862 --> 20:32.432
Well, you know
how his mom is, Dan.

20:32.465 --> 20:34.634
She's not gonna change, she's
not gonna get any better.

20:34.667 --> 20:35.868
Then he knows
he can come back.

20:40.039 --> 20:41.974
We just keep losin' 'em.

20:42.008 --> 20:43.410
And this one's not even ours.

20:47.880 --> 20:49.516
Come here and give
your mommy a hug.

20:49.549 --> 20:50.483
Uh-uh.

20:50.517 --> 20:51.584
Where you goin'?

Well, he said he was

21:06.766 --> 21:08.034
gonna move back to Michigan.

21:08.067 --> 21:10.036
He wanted to tell
you himself, but I

21:10.069 --> 21:11.471
just thought you should know.

21:11.504 --> 21:13.673
Well, did he say
why he was leaving?

21:13.706 --> 21:16.709
He said he felt too
dependent on you living here.

21:16.743 --> 21:19.446
Where would he get a
stupid idea like that?

21:19.479 --> 21:23.950
Uh, well, frankly,
from your father.

21:23.983 --> 21:25.217
DARLENE (ON PHONE):
What if this means

21:25.251 --> 21:26.886
that I never see him again?
