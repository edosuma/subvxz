WEBVTT

00:31.567 --> 00:34.000
This is the worst part of my job, you know.

00:34.067 --> 00:36.234
I do not want to lose a good man.

00:37.968 --> 00:41.100
But it's out of my hands,

00:41.167 --> 00:43.467
and even if it were in my hands, my hands are tied.

00:43.534 --> 00:45.334
It's nothing personal. It's just based on...

00:45.400 --> 00:47.300
Yeah, yeah. Well, why am I getting fired?

00:47.367 --> 00:48.367
You're not getting fired. It's redundancy.

00:48.434 --> 00:49.968
As I say, it's nothing personal.

00:50.033 --> 00:51.968
It's cutbacks being what they are,

00:52.033 --> 00:54.500
you know, you are one of the unlucky ones.

00:54.701 --> 00:56.801
Or one of the lucky ones, in my opinion.

00:59.267 --> 01:00.901
Now I'm going to ask you, David, why,

01:00.968 --> 01:03.200
when there are three other forklift operators,

01:03.267 --> 01:05.701
do you decide to fire me and not Anton?

01:05.767 --> 01:08.367
You know, is this positive discrimination?

01:08.434 --> 01:10.500
Do you have disability quotas you have to fill?

01:10.567 --> 01:12.067
I don't know what you mean. I mean...

01:12.133 --> 01:15.267
Or are you keeping Anton on because he's disabled?

01:15.334 --> 01:17.734
-Anton's not disabled. -He's a midget, David.

01:17.801 --> 01:20.033
Yeah, but you're not disabled if you're a midget, are you?

01:20.100 --> 01:21.434
That's not a disability.

01:21.500 --> 01:22.934
-That's just small. -Yeah, I know, but...

01:23.000 --> 01:25.234
Ronnie Corbett doesn't get special treatment, does he?

01:25.300 --> 01:27.868
Ronnie Corbett's 5'. Anton's 3'4".

01:28.067 --> 01:30.000
So are some children.

01:30.067 --> 01:32.267
Children don't get special favours. Children aren't disabled, are they?

01:32.334 --> 01:33.901
Children don't work in warehouses.

01:33.968 --> 01:38.100
Look, whether or not Anton is indeed a midget or a dwarf...

01:38.167 --> 01:42.267
-No, he's a midget. -What's the difference?

01:42.334 --> 01:46.300
Well, a dwarf is someone who has disproportionately short arms and legs.

01:46.367 --> 01:48.334
Oh, I know the ones. Those...

01:48.400 --> 01:49.934
Yeah. It's caused by a hormone deficiency.

01:50.000 --> 01:51.534
Yeah. Bloody hormones.

01:51.601 --> 01:53.500
-Yeah. -Hmm.

01:53.567 --> 01:55.968
A midget is still a dwarf, but their arms and legs are in proportion.

01:56.033 --> 01:57.334
Sure.

01:57.400 --> 01:59.601
So, what's an elf?

02:00.601 --> 02:01.601
Do you want to answer that?

02:09.234 --> 02:11.767
An elf is a supernatural being.

02:11.834 --> 02:15.300
Sometimes they're invisible, they're like fairies.

02:15.367 --> 02:18.500
They don't actually exist, do they? In real life?

02:43.400 --> 02:45.167
What do you want me to...

02:45.234 --> 02:46.801
Do you think I enjoy doing this? This has been imposed upon me!

02:46.868 --> 02:48.434
(MOCKINGLY) "This has been imposed upon me!

02:48.500 --> 02:50.033
-"This has been imposed upon me!" -Yeah, it has.

02:50.100 --> 02:51.367
Yeah. What do you want me to say? "Oh, I'm sorry."

02:51.434 --> 02:52.500
That'll give you your job back.

02:52.567 --> 02:54.033
Yeah. I want you to say you're sorry.

02:54.100 --> 02:56.234
I want you to apologise and stop passing the buck!

02:56.300 --> 02:58.334
I'm not passing the buck. This is someone else's decision.

02:58.400 --> 02:59.834
I didn't want to do this.

02:59.901 --> 03:01.367
You know. Go above my head if you don't believe me.

03:01.434 --> 03:02.567
Oh, I will go above your head.

03:02.634 --> 03:04.334
Fine. Good luck. It's your prerogative.

03:04.400 --> 03:06.934
Yeah, it is. It's my prerogative. Yeah.

03:11.167 --> 03:13.167
So, is a pixie the same thing as an elf?

03:13.234 --> 03:14.968
-DAVID: Hold on, Gareth. -What?

03:15.033 --> 03:17.801
I just want to know how come he knows so much about midgets?

03:21.334 --> 03:23.300
It's called an education.

03:25.901 --> 03:28.467
-So, what's a goblin? -How long you going to be, mate?

03:31.968 --> 03:34.767
I know, I probably seem like quite an imposing figure now

03:34.834 --> 03:37.467
with my, you know, the slick boss,

03:37.534 --> 03:40.400
but get to know me, you'll see I'm mad.

03:41.033 --> 03:42.234
(CHUCKLING)

03:44.734 --> 03:46.334
I brought that in.

03:46.400 --> 03:47.400
So...

03:48.234 --> 03:49.968
Oh, here we go.

03:50.667 --> 03:52.500
Malcolm.

03:52.567 --> 03:56.100
This is Malcolm. This is Karen Roper, my new secretary.

03:56.167 --> 04:00.167
Although, you can all use her, oh, as an actress said to a bishop.

04:00.234 --> 04:01.901
-MALCOLM: Nice to meet you. -Hello.

04:01.968 --> 04:05.801
David, can I just ask why you've hired yourself a new secretary

04:05.868 --> 04:08.868
when you're having to fire people like Alex this morning?

04:08.934 --> 04:11.167
Different people, different jobs. Isn't it?

04:11.234 --> 04:16.567
To wit, the answer to the question, is it people or task

04:16.634 --> 04:18.734
is, well, you know, people.

04:20.567 --> 04:22.234
Like this person. Kojak.

04:22.300 --> 04:23.701
-(IMITATES SQUEAKING) -David.

04:23.767 --> 04:25.334
That's what we call him. Not to his face.

04:25.400 --> 04:27.934
-What I... -Who loves you, baby?

04:28.133 --> 04:31.500
Am I going to be fired? When will we know what's happening?

04:31.567 --> 04:36.534
Good question. Jennifer is coming in midday today, Greenwich Mean Time.

04:36.601 --> 04:38.267
She will have the verdict then. Okay?

04:38.334 --> 04:40.267
I was just trying to keep the troops happy.

04:40.334 --> 04:43.067
Well, they'd be a lot happier if they knew they'd got jobs.

04:43.133 --> 04:44.167
Yeah.

04:47.367 --> 04:50.200
I'm thinking of other weird-looking bald people we could do.

04:51.133 --> 04:52.801
That one off Benny Hill?

04:52.868 --> 04:54.100
Oh, yeah.

05:03.934 --> 05:06.968
I don't know if you met Tim. He's thinking of leaving.

05:07.033 --> 05:09.300
Yeah, he's feeling bad about himself.

05:09.367 --> 05:11.133
I'm going to have a chat to him,

05:11.200 --> 05:13.701
make him feel good about himself, turn it round.

05:13.767 --> 05:16.868
You know? Look and learn. So...

05:16.934 --> 05:18.634
Timothy!

05:18.701 --> 05:20.300
-Hello. -All right? Can I have a quick word?

05:20.367 --> 05:22.901
In the old office? Walk this way.

05:22.968 --> 05:24.567
(QUACKING)

05:25.534 --> 05:27.434
Always start with a joke.

05:33.200 --> 05:35.868
You might want to make notes, just for...

05:35.934 --> 05:38.601
-Hiya. Come in. -Ta.

05:38.667 --> 05:40.500
-How are you doing? -All right, thanks.

05:40.567 --> 05:43.434
Good. Um, you don't mind if Karen sits in, just to learn the ropes?

05:43.500 --> 05:46.400
No, not at all. What are we doing?

05:46.467 --> 05:50.067
I just want to know why you're thinking of leaving, mate.

05:50.133 --> 05:52.667
I've got to tell you, I'm not thinking of leaving, I am leaving.

05:52.734 --> 05:54.200
Sure. Sure.

05:54.267 --> 05:56.367
I don't mean to stitch anyone up,

05:56.434 --> 05:58.200
but it's nothing I've said or done, is it?

05:58.267 --> 06:01.968
-Not at all, David. No. -Definitely not. Put that down. No way.

06:02.033 --> 06:04.601
No, I mean, I don't want to put words in your mouth,

06:04.667 --> 06:07.334
but what sort of a boss would you say I am?

06:07.400 --> 06:09.367
-I'm a... -Good boss, yeah.

06:09.434 --> 06:10.968
Put down "good". He said "good".

06:11.033 --> 06:12.667
-No, mate, you're a great boss. -He said "great".

06:12.734 --> 06:14.534
It's just that I don't think that I am in a position...

06:14.601 --> 06:16.467
It's not because you asked Dawn out

06:16.534 --> 06:18.300
in front of everyone and she said no, is it?

06:18.367 --> 06:20.400
I didn't ask her out. It was as a friend.

06:20.467 --> 06:22.234
Why does everyone think... It was as a friend.

06:22.300 --> 06:23.567
Put "friend". Put "friend" down.

06:23.634 --> 06:26.100
So, why the move?

06:28.367 --> 06:31.100
-It's not one thing, David. -Go on.

06:31.167 --> 06:33.300
-Can I? -Sure.

06:33.367 --> 06:39.300
Okay. I don't really enjoy the work I do here. I'm sorry, but...

06:39.367 --> 06:41.834
I feel a little bit like I'm wasting my time.

06:41.901 --> 06:45.367
-Like life's too short? -Yeah, exactly. Thank you. Um...

06:45.434 --> 06:47.601
You know, let's be honest, I'm 30, right?

06:47.667 --> 06:50.667
I want to retire with some stories to tell, you know?

06:50.734 --> 06:52.467
That aren't about paper?

06:52.534 --> 06:54.033
Yeah, I can give you paper stories that'll crack you up so...

06:54.100 --> 06:55.100
That's true. They are hilarious.

06:55.167 --> 06:56.868
Hilarious. Put down "hilarious".

06:56.934 --> 06:59.067
-Do you want me to go on? -How many have you got?

06:59.133 --> 07:03.267
It's like an alarm clock's gone off and I've just got to get away.

07:03.334 --> 07:06.500
I think it was John Lennon who said,

07:06.567 --> 07:08.567
"Life is what happens when you're making other plans."

07:08.634 --> 07:10.968
And that's how I feel, you know.

07:13.434 --> 07:16.868
Although he also said, "I am the walrus, I am the eggman",

07:16.934 --> 07:19.801
so I don't know what to believe.

07:19.868 --> 07:23.434
-Okay, David, listen to me... -No, no, you listen to me, "Tim".

07:23.500 --> 07:28.033
When you first came here, you didn't know about the paper industry.

07:28.100 --> 07:30.834
I showed you the ropes, I nurtured you, I gave you a good job.

07:30.901 --> 07:33.100
-That he doesn't want! -I didn't ask you.

07:33.167 --> 07:34.868
Okay, you did ask me how I felt and I'm telling you.

07:35.067 --> 07:36.767
-I don't want to know now. -What do you mean?

07:36.834 --> 07:38.834
-This has been a waste of time. -It's not a waste of time.

07:38.901 --> 07:40.968
Well, I'll tell you what,

07:41.033 --> 07:43.133
why don't you both go and do some work instead of whinging, please?

07:43.200 --> 07:44.968
-TIM: This is silly. -No, go on.

07:45.033 --> 07:47.634
And don't say out there what you've said in here,

07:47.701 --> 07:49.467
apart from the thing about a good boss, if you want to.

07:49.534 --> 07:53.300
I don't want you spreading your bad vibes around my office, all right?

07:53.367 --> 07:55.500
You be like that at the party, that'll be fun.

07:58.067 --> 08:00.100
You try and do a good deed

08:01.100 --> 08:02.400
and that...

08:13.000 --> 08:14.234
You all right?

08:14.300 --> 08:15.801
Yeah, hello. All right?

08:15.868 --> 08:19.200
(CLEARS THROAT) Are you going to the party?

08:19.267 --> 08:20.901
-Yeah, yeah. Of course. -Brilliant.

08:21.133 --> 08:22.367
-I wouldn't miss it. -Cool.

08:22.434 --> 08:24.467
-And you? -Uh, yes.

08:24.534 --> 08:25.367
Good.

08:27.067 --> 08:28.834
Hooray!

08:28.901 --> 08:30.400
-See you later. -Yeah.

08:37.500 --> 08:39.500
DAWN: I hope they get rid of me.

08:39.567 --> 08:43.267
Because then I might actually get off my arse and do something.

08:43.334 --> 08:48.367
I don't think it's many little girls' dream to be a receptionist.

08:48.434 --> 08:49.834
I don't know what I'll do,

08:49.901 --> 08:52.133
but whatever it is, it's got to be a career move

08:52.200 --> 08:54.534
and not just another arbitrary job.

08:55.834 --> 08:58.868
Tim's advice is that it's better to be

08:58.934 --> 09:00.868
at the bottom of a ladder you want to climb

09:00.934 --> 09:02.667
than halfway up one you don't.

09:03.734 --> 09:05.868
But, um, I just...

09:05.934 --> 09:08.267
I don't want to be treading water, you know,

09:08.334 --> 09:12.200
and then wake up in another five years' time and say, "Shit! Done it again."

09:13.200 --> 09:14.868
(SHREDDER WHIRRING)

09:26.434 --> 09:27.434
Do you think you could...

09:29.634 --> 09:31.100
-Could you not do that here, mate? -Mmm?

09:31.167 --> 09:32.767
Sorry, I just wondered if you couldn't do that here?

09:32.834 --> 09:34.300
-I've got to do it, mate. -Really?

09:35.868 --> 09:38.400
No chance you could throw it in the bin?

09:38.467 --> 09:40.634
Yeah, and maybe I should just

09:40.701 --> 09:42.667
take them around to rival companies and just hand them out.

09:42.734 --> 09:46.834
Good point, but could you just throw it in the bin?

09:46.901 --> 09:49.901
Gareth, can you keep it down a bit?

09:49.968 --> 09:51.801
-Hmm? -Can you stop it?

09:53.167 --> 09:56.400
Yeah. I'll just do it like this.

09:56.467 --> 09:58.100
(RIPPING)

10:02.934 --> 10:03.934
(EXHALES)

10:07.334 --> 10:09.467
-Hiya. -Hi, David. Are you ready?

10:09.534 --> 10:10.601
Yeah.

10:11.868 --> 10:13.667
-Who's she? -Don't know.

10:22.033 --> 10:24.667
Now, I know I promised you some kind of answer today.

10:24.734 --> 10:26.834
I don't think it's the one that you were expecting.

10:26.901 --> 10:29.334
Firstly, I'm moving on.

10:29.400 --> 10:30.400
Have you been fired?

10:30.467 --> 10:31.968
-(LAUGHS) No. -No?

10:32.033 --> 10:34.868
No, I've been made into a partner.

10:34.934 --> 10:36.601
They've made you into a partner?

10:36.667 --> 10:38.968
So that'll be Wernham Hogg Taylor-Clark.

10:39.033 --> 10:41.033
That's mental. They'll have to change the stationery.

10:41.100 --> 10:43.667
Yeah, I think we might get a discount, though, as we're in the business.

10:43.734 --> 10:45.000
40% sometimes.

10:45.067 --> 10:46.901
The point is, David, my job is now available

10:46.968 --> 10:49.767
and the board thought that either you or Neil

10:49.834 --> 10:52.234
should take over the role.

10:52.300 --> 10:57.167
I can tell you now, the board have voted 5-2 in favour of you taking the job.

10:59.734 --> 11:02.834
Voted for me 5-2? There's only seven on the board, isn't there?

11:02.901 --> 11:05.534
-So it's five out of seven. A landslide. -Now I did...

11:05.601 --> 11:07.601
-David. -Go on.

11:07.667 --> 11:10.367
You've always made it very clear that you're 100% committed to your branch.

11:10.434 --> 11:12.400
Probably why I got the...

11:12.467 --> 11:15.400
You do understand that if you take on my job, Neil will stay in Swindon

11:15.467 --> 11:18.801
and your branch will be downsized and incorporated into his?

11:18.868 --> 11:20.500
Yep.

11:20.567 --> 11:22.901
Well, I know that you're very loyal to your family here...

11:22.968 --> 11:26.267
I'll be loyal to the whole family. It's one big family.

11:26.334 --> 11:28.067
Yeah, I'm just sensitive to the fact

11:28.133 --> 11:31.000
that you have strong, let's say, emotional ties to your team.

11:31.067 --> 11:36.200
Well, yeah, but there is the emotion as "good in business" syndrome, sure,

notwithstanding the "cruel to be kind" scenario.

11:39.667 --> 11:40.834
I'm sorry, David, you've lost me.

11:40.901 --> 11:43.300
Well, you're not looking at the whole pie, Jenny.

11:43.367 --> 11:45.367
Wernham Hogg is one big pie,

11:45.434 --> 11:47.901
and if I've left me in charge of that one big pie,

11:47.968 --> 11:51.400
I'll be in charge of the pie and the people are the fruit.

11:51.467 --> 11:53.467
I don't have time for the pie thing, David.

11:53.534 --> 11:56.968
You don't want it, no. I'm saying, yeah, okay, I'll take the job, please.

11:57.033 --> 12:00.968
Good. Okay, well, the first step is to meet with Alan and the board.

12:01.033 --> 12:03.934
Yep. What's five out of seven as a percentage?

12:04.000 --> 12:06.067
-Uh, 70%. -Mmm.

12:06.133 --> 12:08.500
71.4. So...

12:08.567 --> 12:13.234
Call Susan and arrange to meet the board and finalise all the details.

12:13.300 --> 12:15.400
Congratulations and good luck.

12:15.467 --> 12:18.334
Yeah, you don't need luck when you've got 71.4% of the population behind you.

12:41.601 --> 12:42.934
Fine.

12:43.000 --> 12:44.901
What's the damage?

12:45.100 --> 12:47.133
It's complicated.

Um, well,

13:13.868 --> 13:16.634

13:16.701 --> 13:20.634
The bad news is Neil will be taking over both branches

You didn't see me, ohh.

13:36.767 --> 13:41.601
On a more positive note, the good news is I've been promoted.

13:43.467 --> 13:46.267
So, every cloud...

13:52.701 --> 13:54.901
You're still thinking about the bad news, aren't you?

13:55.133 --> 13:58.467
There's no good news, David. It's only bad news and irrelevant news.

13:58.534 --> 13:59.968
Yeah, that's not a phrase though, is it?

14:00.033 --> 14:01.434
I couldn't come out and go,

14:01.500 --> 14:03.500
"I've got some bad news and some irrelevant news."

14:03.567 --> 14:07.334
You could have just told us about Neil and kept your promotion to yourself.

14:07.400 --> 14:09.033
Should have told you the good news first...

14:09.100 --> 14:11.234
There is no good news, David.

14:11.300 --> 14:15.000
Hmm. I think promotion is generally considered good news.

14:15.067 --> 14:17.000
We're going to lose our jobs!

14:17.067 --> 14:18.400
You're not all going to lose your jobs.

You know, you're not going to lose your job.

14:25.667 --> 14:28.934
So, let's get it in perspective, yeah?

14:29.734 --> 14:30.934
Come on.

14:33.868 --> 14:37.100
You know there's only seven people on the board, yeah?

14:40.801 --> 14:43.300
MAN: When are the rest of us going to find out?

14:45.434 --> 14:49.000
I can't believe it. After all the things he said, it's just...

14:50.033 --> 14:51.200
I'm in shock.

14:51.834 --> 14:53.167

15:09.400 --> 15:11.133
So you're definitely leaving, then?

15:12.100 --> 15:14.500

15:28.100 --> 15:30.601
So I can still be your assistant?

15:30.667 --> 15:32.901
Can I... If you're going off...

15:32.968 --> 15:37.667
No. I'll be getting a proper assistant, a PA, probably so...

15:37.734 --> 15:39.367
-A lady? -Hopefully, yeah.

15:39.434 --> 15:41.601
Well, not 'cause of that, just...

15:41.667 --> 15:43.334
What about Neil?

15:43.400 --> 15:45.634
Is he going to be needing an assistant? I could be his assistant.

15:45.701 --> 15:47.868
Neil's bringing his man with him.

15:47.934 --> 15:49.367

16:42.567 --> 16:44.801
he's playing with his dog and everything.

16:44.868 --> 16:46.701
-Nigger. -Yeah, that's not offensive.

16:46.767 --> 16:48.500
That's the dog's name.

16:48.567 --> 16:50.634
It was the '40s as well, before racism was bad, innit? So...

16:50.701 --> 16:53.167
-The dog was called Nigger. -Don't keep saying it but...

(CLEARS THROAT) Yeah, well.

24:03.868 --> 24:06.734
The thing is, I've been with this nutty lot way too long

24:06.801 --> 24:09.033
to sell them down the river for a couple of extra quid a year.

24:09.100 --> 24:10.567
-So, not interested. -Right.

24:10.634 --> 24:13.267
It's just that I was speaking to Paula and she seems...

24:13.334 --> 24:14.934
-Paula? Oh, yeah. -Alan's assistant.

24:15.000 --> 24:17.334
And she seems to think the reason that you didn't take the job

24:17.400 --> 24:19.300
was not because you didn't want it,

24:19.367 --> 24:22.100
but because you failed the medical because of high blood pressure.

24:22.167 --> 24:24.901
Well.

24:24.968 --> 24:28.167
You got to ask yourself why did I get high blood pressure

24:28.234 --> 24:30.200
on the day of the medical, how come?

24:30.267 --> 24:33.267
Are you saying that you cheated science and faked high blood pressure

24:33.334 --> 24:35.500
so that you could remain in the job?

24:35.567 --> 24:37.834
You know, you've got to ask yourself that.

24:37.901 --> 24:39.534
Did you?

24:39.601 --> 24:42.534
What's worse, cheating medical science or cheating friends?

24:42.601 --> 24:45.234
Yeah? The board of directors come to me and they go,

24:45.300 --> 24:47.300
"Oh, David, you're the best man for the job.

24:47.367 --> 24:50.200
"You've got to take the job and we won't take no for an answer."

24:50.267 --> 24:54.734
"Oh, hold on, you failed the medical. Oh, all right, stay with..." You know?

24:54.801 --> 24:57.901
For all your mole knows, they may or may not have said that to me.

24:57.968 --> 25:00.334
-Did they? -They may or may not have.

25:00.400 --> 25:04.767
So, you faked high blood pressure in order to fail a medical test?

25:05.634 --> 25:06.667
Oh, no.

25:06.734 --> 25:08.267
(CHUCKLING)

25:08.334 --> 25:09.400
See you later.

25:15.033 --> 25:17.000
(I'M NOT IN LOVE BY 10CC PLAYING)

25:33.067 --> 25:34.601
(INAUDIBLE)

26:15.067 --> 26:17.267
So, when are you leaving me?

26:17.334 --> 26:20.033
Um, well, it probably won't be for quite a while.

26:20.100 --> 26:23.868
-Autumn? -Um, probably not.

26:23.934 --> 26:27.801
Oh. Um, I thought you wanted to go back to university and everything.

26:27.868 --> 26:31.200
Yeah, I will, but there's a slight bit of a change of plan.

26:31.267 --> 26:32.567
Oh, right.

26:34.601 --> 26:36.834
David's made me Senior Sales Clerk.

26:40.434 --> 26:42.467
Wow!

26:42.534 --> 26:46.434
Um, I thought you wanted to, like, be a psychologist.

26:46.500 --> 26:49.634
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. But Senior Sales Clerk is...

26:49.701 --> 26:53.667
Well, it's 500 quid guaranteed extra a year.

26:53.734 --> 26:57.300
And if I do a bit of networking, then there's every chance

26:57.367 --> 27:00.334
I could be in David's chair in three years. So...

27:00.400 --> 27:02.467
Oh.

27:02.534 --> 27:06.334
(STAMMERING) All that talk about, like, getting on, moving on in the world...

27:06.400 --> 27:08.901
No, I said moving up. Yeah? Moving up.

27:09.100 --> 27:13.167
Moving up can mean within an internal ladder, framework,

27:13.234 --> 27:15.868
or sideways to external, then up.

27:15.934 --> 27:17.701
You know, you've got to look at the whole pie

27:17.767 --> 27:20.100
vis-a-vis my current life situation. You know?

27:20.167 --> 27:22.200
Vis-a... Pie?

27:23.767 --> 27:27.234
Which means, of course, my old job is free.

27:29.968 --> 27:32.033
So, you know, have a word.

27:32.100 --> 27:34.067
-Timothy! -Timothy!

27:35.334 --> 27:37.267
(TRUE BY SPANDAU BALLET PLAYING)

27:56.567 --> 28:00.300
You grow up, you work half a century, you get a golden handshake,

28:00.367 --> 28:03.567
you rest a couple of years and you're dead.

28:03.634 --> 28:06.868
And the only thing that makes that crazy ride worthwhile is,

28:06.934 --> 28:09.767
"Did I enjoy it? What did I learn? What was the point?"

28:09.834 --> 28:11.667
That's where I come in.

28:11.734 --> 28:14.601
You've seen how I react to people, I make them feel good,

28:14.667 --> 28:17.400
make them think that anything's possible, yeah?

28:17.467 --> 28:20.267
If I make them laugh along the way, sue me.

28:21.734 --> 28:23.767
I don't do it so they'll turn around and go,

28:23.834 --> 28:25.467
"Oh, thank you, David, for the opportunity.

28:25.534 --> 28:28.868
"Thank you for the wisdom. Thank you for the laughs."

28:28.934 --> 28:33.500
I do it so one day someone will go, "There goes David Brent.

28:35.400 --> 28:36.734
"I must remember to thank him."
