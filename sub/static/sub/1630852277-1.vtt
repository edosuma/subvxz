we will check the ephemeris

What?

The general.

He charged us
for the snacks, but they're free.

know why we're here?

I couldn't believe it.

16:00.000 --> 16:03.500

Kate, have you watched any news today?

Approximately 36 hours ago,

18:27.208 --> 18:31.791
uh, PhD candidate
Kate Dibiasky here discovered

18:32.458 --> 18:34.000
a very large comet.

18:34.083 --> 18:34.916
Oh.

18:35.000 --> 18:36.791
-[Mindy] Yeah.
-Good for you.

18:36.875 --> 18:39.541
A comet between
five to ten kilometers across,

18:39.625 --> 18:41.875
that we estimate came from the, uh…

18:41.958 --> 18:44.250
from the… from the Oort cloud.

18:44.333 --> 18:45.208
[Orlean] Wow.

18:45.291 --> 18:47.791
Which is the outermost part
of the solar system.

18:48.416 --> 18:49.458
And, um…

18:50.708 --> 18:53.416
And using Gauss's method
of orbital determination

18:53.500 --> 18:58.625
and the average astrometric uncertainty
of 0.04 arcseconds, we then asked--

18:58.708 --> 19:03.000
-[chuckling] Whoa! What the hell is… What?
-I'm so bored. Just tell us what it is.

19:03.083 --> 19:05.291
-What? Stop what?
-[Jason] Seriously, stop.

19:05.375 --> 19:08.416
What Dr. Mindy is trying to say is
there's a comet headed towards Earth,

19:08.500 --> 19:10.708
and according to NASA's computers,

19:10.791 --> 19:12.916
that object is gonna hit the Pacific Ocean

19:13.000 --> 19:15.166
at 62 miles due west
off the coast of Chile.

19:15.250 --> 19:17.166
Then what happens? Like, a tidal wave?

19:17.250 --> 19:20.666
No. It will be far more catastrophic.

19:20.750 --> 19:25.250
There'll be mile-high tsunamis
fanning out all across the globe.

19:26.291 --> 19:32.333
If this comet makes impact, it will have
the power of a billion Hiroshima bombs.

19:32.958 --> 19:36.375
[exhales sharply] There'll be
magnitude 10 or 11 earthquakes--

to articulate the science.

[Mindy] I don't think you understand
the gravity of the situation.

19:48.000 --> 19:49.875
I'm trying to articulate it
the best I can--

19:49.958 --> 19:54.791
Madam President, this comet
is what we call a planet-killer.

19:54.875 --> 19:56.333
[Mindy] That is correct.

19:58.791 --> 19:59.875
Mmm-hmm.

20:00.791 --> 20:02.333
So how certain is this?

20:02.416 --> 20:05.541
There's 100% certainty of impact.

20:05.625 --> 20:07.666
Please, don't say 100%.

20:07.750 --> 20:10.333
Can we just call it
a potentially significant event?

20:10.416 --> 20:11.458
-[Orlean] Yeah.
-Yes.

20:11.541 --> 20:14.250
But it isn't potentially going to happen.

20:14.791 --> 20:16.500
It is going to happen.

20:16.583 --> 20:20.083
Exactly. 99.78% to be exact.

20:20.166 --> 20:22.291
Oh, great. Okay, so it's not 100%.

20:22.375 --> 20:25.250
Well, scientists never like to say 100%.

20:25.333 --> 20:27.791
Call it 70% and let's just move on.

20:27.875 --> 20:29.541
But it's not even close to 70%.

20:29.625 --> 20:31.958
You cannot go around saying to people

20:32.041 --> 20:34.791
that there's 100% chance
that they're gonna die.

20:34.875 --> 20:37.791
[chuckling] You know? It's just nuts.

20:37.875 --> 20:40.458
We should get some of
our scientists on this, you know.

20:40.541 --> 20:44.250
No offense, but you're just two people
that walked in here with--

20:44.333 --> 20:45.541
Dr. Oglethorpe.

20:45.625 --> 20:47.166
Dr. Ov… Ogilvy. Yeah.

20:47.250 --> 20:50.791
I've been head of planetary defense
at NASA for 15 years.

20:50.875 --> 20:55.333
And Dr. Mindy is a tenured professor
of astronomy at Michigan State,

20:55.416 --> 20:58.375
where Miss Dibiasky
is a doctoral candidate.

20:58.458 --> 21:01.083
-[Orlean] Good.
-I'm sorry. Did you say Michigan State?

21:01.166 --> 21:03.750
Exactly. They have
an excellent astronomy department.

21:03.833 --> 21:05.250
-[Mindy] Yes.
-Come on, bro.

21:05.333 --> 21:07.625
You kidding?
You wanna see my fucking SAT scores?

21:07.708 --> 21:09.708
Okay, let's bottom line this.

21:09.791 --> 21:11.666
What is this gonna cost me?

21:11.750 --> 21:13.875
You know, what's the ask here?

21:13.958 --> 21:17.041
There are government plans in place.

21:17.125 --> 21:19.541
Um, actions we can take through NASA.

21:19.625 --> 21:22.583
-[Mindy breathing heavily]
-Drones that can be outfitted with nukes

21:22.666 --> 21:27.083
to deflect and hopefully
change the orbit of this comet.

21:27.166 --> 21:28.916
We must act now.

21:29.000 --> 21:31.583
[Orlean] Oh, hey.
All right, all right, all right.

21:31.666 --> 21:34.000
-When are the midterms? Three weeks.
-Three weeks.

21:34.083 --> 21:36.791
So, if this breaks before then,
we lose Congress.

21:36.875 --> 21:38.833
Then there's nothing we can do about it.

21:38.916 --> 21:39.833
It'll be gridlocked.

21:39.916 --> 21:43.916
-The timing is just… It's atrocious.
-[drawer opens and closes]

21:45.000 --> 21:51.125
Okay, at this very moment,
I say we sit tight and assess.

21:51.208 --> 21:52.458
[Jason] Sit tight and assess.

21:52.541 --> 21:55.625
[Orlean] Let's get some other people
on this. Some Ivy Leaguers.

21:55.708 --> 21:58.458
And you and I will review the NASA plans.

21:58.541 --> 22:00.291
-Okay?
-I'd greatly appreciate that.

22:00.375 --> 22:03.583
Am I to understand correctly that,

22:03.666 --> 22:07.333
after all of the information
you've received today,

22:08.041 --> 22:12.291
the decision you're making
is to "sit tight and assess"?

22:12.375 --> 22:15.625
-I'm sorry, who is she?
-Who the fuck are you? Aren't you her son?

22:15.708 --> 22:18.416
I'm the fucking Chief of Staff,
Boy with the Dragon Tattoo.

22:18.500 --> 22:19.791
So I'm doing fine.

22:19.875 --> 22:22.541
[whispers] We gotta get out of here.
This place is a freak show.

22:22.625 --> 22:25.208
[Mindy] I think what Miss Dibiasky
is trying to say

22:25.291 --> 22:30.375
is that the idea of sitting tight
is an extremely, extremely dangerous--

22:30.458 --> 22:32.125
Oh, oh! [laughing]

22:32.208 --> 22:33.416
[sighs]

22:33.500 --> 22:36.750
Thank you.
One good thing happened today. [chuckles]

22:36.833 --> 22:38.916
Okay, funny story. [clears throat]

22:39.000 --> 22:40.666
When I was running for president,

22:40.750 --> 22:43.958
I had to sneak cigarettes for
the whole first month of the campaign

22:44.041 --> 22:46.291
because, you know,
photographs of me smoking

22:46.375 --> 22:48.333
went for, what, a hundred grand a pop?

22:48.416 --> 22:49.500
[chuckles]

22:49.583 --> 22:52.541
So, I'm always hiding, but,
you know, I just got sick of it.

22:53.166 --> 22:56.208
And I just said, "You know what,
I'm gonna smoke whenever I want to."

22:56.291 --> 22:58.416
[chuckles] Mmm…

23:00.666 --> 23:01.791
Guess what happened?

23:02.666 --> 23:06.500
-I went up three points in the polls.
-[Jason] They loved that she kept it real.

23:06.583 --> 23:08.458
They love watching a smokeshow smoke.

23:08.541 --> 23:11.583
I can't think of another president
that I'd ever wanna see in Playboy.

23:11.666 --> 23:15.000
Do you know how many, uh,
"the world is ending" meetings

23:15.083 --> 23:16.708
that we've had over the years?

23:16.791 --> 23:20.833
Economic collapse, loose nukes,
car exhaust killing the atmosphere.

23:20.916 --> 23:23.666
-Rogue AI.
-Drought, famine, plague…

23:23.750 --> 23:24.958
-Uh…
-[Orlean] Everything.

23:25.041 --> 23:28.833
[chuckles] Alien invasion,
population growth, hole in the ozone--

23:28.916 --> 23:29.916
Jason, hey.

23:30.000 --> 23:32.166
-Read the room for once in your life.
-Sorry, Mom.

23:32.750 --> 23:35.000
Point is, I have a job to do.

23:35.083 --> 23:37.833
You do understand
that this is an apocalyptic event.

23:37.916 --> 23:43.250
This is a large celestial body
heading towards our planet at speeds--

23:43.333 --> 23:45.333
Dr. Mindy, I hear you.

23:46.458 --> 23:47.625
I hear you.

23:48.625 --> 23:51.208
-You should be proud.
-[breathes deeply] Thank you.

23:51.291 --> 23:54.666
I'm taking it very seriously.
I'm taking it straight in the heart.

23:54.750 --> 23:57.875
I'm so glad to hear that.
You have no idea.

23:57.958 --> 24:03.000
Hey, gang, obviously everything we talked
about in here, super classified, right?

24:03.083 --> 24:04.500
-[Oglethorpe] Yeah.
-Cool.

24:04.583 --> 24:05.750
Thanks for dressing up.

24:11.958 --> 24:14.291
[upbeat tense music playing]

24:14.375 --> 24:17.041
[Mindy] You're saying
we're just gonna leak it to the press?

24:17.125 --> 24:19.625
-Isn't that illegal?
-Hell yeah, we're going to leak it.

24:19.708 --> 24:22.333
In case you didn't notice,
the White House just blew us off.

24:22.416 --> 24:24.375
My boyfriend, Phillip,
says he knows a reporter

24:24.458 --> 24:26.458
from the New York Herald
who will talk to us.

24:26.541 --> 24:29.250
-Adul Grelio.
-Good. He's a heavy hitter.

24:29.333 --> 24:32.541
And I'll reach out to more of
the scientific community on the down-low.

24:33.875 --> 24:38.416
-I just feel like this isn't what I do.
-You're just telling a story.

24:38.500 --> 24:39.750
Keep it simple.

24:40.458 --> 24:41.583
No math.

24:42.791 --> 24:44.166
But it's all math.

24:45.000 --> 24:47.875
[music continues playing]

24:51.166 --> 24:53.458
[uplifting electronic music playing]

24:56.583 --> 24:59.333
[male voice on video] It all started
with a connection.

24:59.416 --> 25:03.041
A simple gesture that created so much.

25:03.875 --> 25:05.000
So many choices.

25:06.208 --> 25:08.541
Sometimes, it can even feel like too much.

25:09.375 --> 25:10.875
Until now.

25:10.958 --> 25:13.291
Introducing BASH LiiF.

25:14.083 --> 25:16.791
Life, without the stress of living.

25:16.875 --> 25:18.500
[cheers and applause]

25:18.583 --> 25:21.416
[woman on PA] Before we introduce
the founder and CEO of BASH,

25:21.500 --> 25:23.791
please remember
to avoid direct eye contact,

25:23.875 --> 25:27.458
sudden movements,
coughing or negative facial expressions.

25:27.541 --> 25:30.916
And now, please welcome
Sir Peter Isherwell.

25:31.000 --> 25:32.625
[cheers and applause]

25:34.000 --> 25:35.791
[man 1] We love you, Peter!

25:39.916 --> 25:42.916
[audience cheering loudly]

25:46.083 --> 25:48.125
[man 2] We love you, Peter!

25:48.208 --> 25:49.375
Hello, everyone.

25:49.458 --> 25:51.833
All of my life's work,

25:52.458 --> 25:57.416
really, I see has been driven
by an inexpressible need for a friend

25:58.000 --> 26:00.416
who would understand and soothe me.

26:00.500 --> 26:05.791
And you know, now all those years of work
have come to fruition with BASH LiiF,

26:05.875 --> 26:10.375
our new BASH 14.3, uh, phone

26:10.458 --> 26:14.750
is fully integrated
into your every feeling and desire

26:14.833 --> 26:17.333
without you needing
to say one single word.

26:17.416 --> 26:18.291
If I feel…

26:19.000 --> 26:20.291
-Sad.
-[boy] Afraid.

26:20.375 --> 26:21.458
Or alone.

26:21.541 --> 26:25.750
The BASH 14.3 phone,
when set to the life setting,

26:25.833 --> 26:28.958
instantly senses my mood
through blood pressure…

26:29.041 --> 26:31.541
-Uh, heartbeats and--
-[phone chimes]

26:31.625 --> 26:34.000
[automated voice] Your vitals
show that you are sad.

26:34.083 --> 26:35.833
This will cheer you up, Peter.

26:35.916 --> 26:40.583
[girl] ♪ You are my best friend
You are my best friend ♪

26:40.666 --> 26:43.541
[singing indistinctly]
♪ You make me happy… ♪

26:43.625 --> 26:46.416
[Peter laughing] Oh, that's wonderful.

26:46.500 --> 26:48.666
That video. Um…

26:48.750 --> 26:52.083
It also, seriously, uh, schedules

26:52.166 --> 26:55.375
a therapy session
with a nearby professional,

26:55.458 --> 27:00.208
so we can make sure that
these sad feelings never ever ever return.

27:00.291 --> 27:02.958
-May I say something, Mr. Isherwell?
-[Peter] No.

27:03.041 --> 27:07.541
And to support, uh, BASH LiiF,
uh, I wanna officially announce…

27:07.625 --> 27:10.041
Oh, give me the phones. They're not yours.

27:12.916 --> 27:15.125
-[softly] Say bye.
-Bye, Mr. Isherwell.

27:15.208 --> 27:16.458
Bye, Peter.

27:16.541 --> 27:18.458
Um, I love you, Peter.

27:18.541 --> 27:21.333
Are you sure the video
of the puppy on the rooster

27:21.416 --> 27:25.416
is optimizing our prepubescent
sense memory consumer sector?

27:25.500 --> 27:27.166
I find the bird quite threatening.

27:27.250 --> 27:30.291
We will cross-check
the data on that, for sure.

27:30.375 --> 27:32.958
Mr. Isherwell, Paul Debent
wanted me to give this to you.

27:33.041 --> 27:35.791
He got it from
an astronomer friend of his in Mexico.

27:38.166 --> 27:39.000
Oh, my.

27:40.375 --> 27:43.000
What other confirmation
do we have on this, Adul?

27:43.083 --> 27:46.416
[Adul] I've spoken to Dr. Oglethorpe in DC
and he confirmed it and all the math.

27:46.500 --> 27:48.500
Then I showed it
to Dr. Franks at Columbia,

27:48.583 --> 27:50.833
and he almost fell out of his chair.

27:50.916 --> 27:54.875
So, look, I have to admit.
I was very skeptical at first,

27:54.958 --> 27:56.583
but this is all quite credible.

27:56.666 --> 27:58.916
The calculations are credible.

27:59.416 --> 28:00.250
Jesus.

28:00.750 --> 28:02.750
And the president
really said to sit tight?

28:02.833 --> 28:05.583
-[Mindy] Yes. That's correct.
-"Sit tight and assess."

28:05.666 --> 28:07.708
She's probably worried about the midterms.

28:07.791 --> 28:09.375
We need to move fast.

28:09.458 --> 28:11.333
The feds will claim breach of security,

28:11.416 --> 28:13.375
so make sure these two
get a pro bono attorney.

28:13.458 --> 28:16.458
-[woman 1] You can use my attorney.
-You can certainly afford it now.

28:16.541 --> 28:17.833
We're gonna hire a lawyer?

28:17.916 --> 28:20.166
-[woman 1] That wasn't necessary.
-[woman 2] It was.

28:20.250 --> 28:21.791
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Sorry.

28:21.875 --> 28:23.166
That was not called for.

28:23.250 --> 28:25.083
[Mindy] I just have a question here.

28:25.166 --> 28:27.625
How is it criminal if we just tell people,

28:27.708 --> 28:31.000
like the public, you know,
what we saw, and tell them the truth?

28:31.083 --> 28:34.166
Make sure this one gets media training
before he hits the shows.

28:34.250 --> 28:35.875
He seems a step slow.

28:35.958 --> 28:38.083
What does that mean,
I need media training?

28:39.041 --> 28:41.791
They want us on a show
called The Daily Rip

28:41.875 --> 28:44.500
first thing in the morning
before the article comes out.

28:44.583 --> 28:46.416
You guys know what The Daily Rip is?

28:46.500 --> 28:49.000
It's like the best show.
Everyone wants to be on it.

28:49.083 --> 28:50.916
Brie and Jack have legendary chemistry.

28:51.000 --> 28:52.250
They asked me to go on once.

28:52.333 --> 28:54.500
I was so excited
I couldn't sleep for two nights,

28:54.583 --> 28:55.916
but then they cut me for time.

28:56.000 --> 28:57.750
Still hurts me to think about that.

28:57.833 --> 29:01.583
I know what show you're talking about.
My wife loves that show.

29:01.666 --> 29:04.458
Okay, can you just tell me
what this is all about? Okay?

29:04.541 --> 29:07.916
'Cause you haven't read my article
on Conlon getting hard in the art class.

29:08.000 --> 29:10.791
Now Adul Grelio has come down
from his mountaintop for your thing.

29:10.875 --> 29:13.625
You won't even give me
a lousy pronoun? Come on.

29:13.708 --> 29:16.708
A comet, bigger than the asteroid
that destroyed the dinosaurs,

29:16.791 --> 29:18.166
is headed directly at Earth.

29:18.250 --> 29:20.541
If it isn't deflected,
the entire planet dies.

29:21.083 --> 29:22.625
Wait, what did you just say?

29:22.708 --> 29:24.000
It's for a video game.

29:27.458 --> 29:28.791
Are you being serious?

29:29.541 --> 29:30.541
Yes.

29:32.791 --> 29:34.083
Oh, my God.

29:34.166 --> 29:36.833
-[pleasant piano music playing]
-[inaudible dialogue]

29:41.083 --> 29:43.083
[gasping]

29:44.333 --> 29:47.041
Oh, my God! What the fuck, man?

29:47.125 --> 29:49.916
I love you too. All right. Yeah.

29:50.541 --> 29:52.958
Hey, guys,
we gotta keep walking, all right?

29:53.041 --> 29:54.208
Come on.

29:54.291 --> 29:56.166
[pensive music playing]

30:30.791 --> 30:33.458
-You must be Dr. Mindy and Miss Dibiasky?
-Yes.

30:33.541 --> 30:35.833
Jack and Brie are so excited
to have you on the show.

30:35.916 --> 30:37.750
Really? They know who we are?

30:37.833 --> 30:40.166
White House is denying
they even met with them.

30:40.250 --> 30:43.791
Well, assholes will always be assholes.

30:52.750 --> 30:54.625
Hi, I'm Thalia.

30:54.708 --> 30:57.000
The Herald sent me
to help with your wardrobe.

30:58.416 --> 30:59.833
Oh, I'm not wearing that.

31:01.583 --> 31:05.416
[woman 1] Yeah, you actually have
really great facial structure.

31:05.500 --> 31:08.333
How 'bout if we trim
this beard down a little bit and--

31:08.416 --> 31:09.833
I love your hair.

31:10.625 --> 31:11.541
Thank you.

31:12.375 --> 31:15.958
How are we gonna do this?
I talk about the discovery and you…

31:16.666 --> 31:19.083
talk about how urgent it is
that we take action.

31:19.166 --> 31:21.416
[whispers] How do we say it? I mean…

31:22.708 --> 31:26.125
-Shouldn't we practice it or write it out?
-[woman 1] Can I get you some water?

31:26.208 --> 31:28.458
Yeah, water. Yeah, water would be nice.

31:29.625 --> 31:32.416
You are here now.
You are here now. You are here now.

31:32.500 --> 31:37.375
[repeating] Eleven benevolent elephants.
Eleven benevolent elephants.

31:38.125 --> 31:40.041
-Just gonna take some Xanax.
-Hmm.

31:41.125 --> 31:42.833
[Mindy] I take it sometimes when I…

31:44.458 --> 31:46.625
Kate, not this time. Not this time.

31:51.416 --> 31:56.291
[sighs] He just needs to breathe
and speak up. You know?

31:56.375 --> 31:57.875
He's got this. I know he does.

31:57.958 --> 32:00.250
[breathing heavily]

32:03.208 --> 32:04.458
Oh, God. Come on.

32:05.333 --> 32:07.125
[straining, exhales]

32:08.125 --> 32:08.958
[straining]

32:09.041 --> 32:12.208
You are here now.
You are here now. You are here now.

32:12.291 --> 32:13.333
You're here now.

32:17.541 --> 32:18.458
Oh, God!

32:18.541 --> 32:20.375
[Jack] You gotta
stop drinking the cheap shit.

32:20.458 --> 32:21.666
[Brie scoffs]

32:21.750 --> 32:23.750
-It's only two glasses.
-Yeah, two and a half.

32:23.833 --> 32:25.541
-[man] We're 20 out.
-Always running late.

32:25.625 --> 32:27.541
[man] Let's make sure that our eye lines,

32:27.625 --> 32:30.250
that we're not looking
at Jack and Brie, please, all right?

32:30.333 --> 32:31.708
And cue the package.

32:31.791 --> 32:33.333
Two glasses. Here we go again.

32:33.416 --> 32:36.166
[theme music playing]

32:52.041 --> 32:54.708
-Ladies okay?
-Yes. And we're live.

32:54.791 --> 32:58.083
Brie, I've got something for you today.
Listen to this.

32:58.166 --> 33:01.041
President Orlean's Supreme Court nominee,
Sheriff Conlon,

33:01.125 --> 33:06.208
has now been identified
as appearing in a softcore porn cable show

33:06.291 --> 33:07.791
-from the early '90s…
-Ridiculous.

33:07.875 --> 33:10.833
-…called Satin Sheet Nights.
-[imperceptible]

33:10.916 --> 33:13.750
-This story just keeps going and going…
-[Brie on TV] Oh, my gosh.

33:13.833 --> 33:15.125
[whispers] Is that Riley Bina?

33:15.208 --> 33:17.166
-[Brie] Yes, well, it's a…
-[Mindy] Really?

33:17.666 --> 33:19.291
[Brie speaking indistinctly on TV]

33:19.375 --> 33:22.208
[whispers] She looks a lot smaller
in person, doesn't she?

33:22.791 --> 33:24.750
-[Brie] Ride 'em, cowboy.
-[laughing]

33:24.833 --> 33:25.916
[purring]

33:26.000 --> 33:27.333
-[Jack] Good.
-[Brie] Hee-haw!

33:27.416 --> 33:30.083
Hey, everyone. I'm Sean from the show.

33:30.166 --> 33:33.875
Uh, we're gonna do… Jack and Brie
are gonna do ten on the SCOTUS nominee.

33:33.958 --> 33:37.250
-Riley Bina, you'll come on and--
-I get to talk about my single, right?

33:37.333 --> 33:40.291
A portion of the profits
goes to the manatee sanctuaries.

33:40.375 --> 33:42.375
Yes, but the, uh, breakup first.

33:42.458 --> 33:45.083
And then Dr. Mindy and Miss Dibiasky,

33:45.166 --> 33:47.583
you'll come on and talk about
that planet you discovered.

33:47.666 --> 33:49.458
Uh… Comet. We found a comet.

33:49.541 --> 33:51.666
They know what we're here
to talk about, right?

33:51.750 --> 33:54.458
Of course. Jack and Brie
love doing science segments.

33:54.541 --> 33:56.375
Just remember, keep it light, fun.

33:56.458 --> 33:58.875
-Jack and Brie love having a good time.
-[sighing]

33:58.958 --> 34:00.500
That's not promising.

34:00.583 --> 34:03.708
You guys discovered a comet?
That's so dope.

34:03.791 --> 34:05.916
I have a tattoo
of a shooting star on my back.

34:06.000 --> 34:07.833
-Oh.
-That's terrific. [chuckles]

34:07.916 --> 34:08.916
[Riley chuckles]

34:13.375 --> 34:17.750
We heard about your breakup too,
so we just wanna say…

34:18.708 --> 34:20.333
We're very sorry, right?

34:20.416 --> 34:23.291
We're real sorry.
You seem like a… great person.

34:24.083 --> 34:26.583
Why don't you mind
your own business, you old fuck?

34:26.666 --> 34:27.791
[girls chuckle]

34:29.500 --> 34:30.500
Okay.

34:33.125 --> 34:35.291
Not gonna lie, but, um, my friends

34:35.375 --> 34:38.750
and my Vroom Vroom Army
have been so amazing.

34:38.833 --> 34:42.500
So, I'm really grateful for that.
But, yeah, I can't lie. It's been hard.

34:42.583 --> 34:45.291
-You're an inspiration. It's incredible.
-To so many.

34:45.375 --> 34:47.250
You're really owning that pain.

34:47.333 --> 34:51.041
You know, Jack, I feel like
there's some kind of conversation

34:51.125 --> 34:54.500
that we need to be having here.
Is there any message

34:54.583 --> 34:58.750
that you would like
to send to your, uh, ex, DJ Chello?

34:59.791 --> 35:01.083
You know, um…

35:01.166 --> 35:02.625
[Jack] If there's something--

35:02.708 --> 35:04.291
-Yeah.
-Right here in this camera.

35:04.375 --> 35:07.666
Tell him. As if that was him.
You tell him exactly what you're thinking.

35:07.750 --> 35:09.208
Okay, um… [clears throat]

35:10.541 --> 35:11.500
[sighs]

35:11.583 --> 35:12.666
Chell.

35:13.500 --> 35:19.250
[sighs] I still love you,
and, um, after many sleepless nights,

35:20.750 --> 35:21.833
three,

35:22.541 --> 35:23.875
I wanna take you back.

35:23.958 --> 35:25.708
I'm sorry. Whoa, uh…

35:25.791 --> 35:26.875
-Is that okay?
-Yeah.

35:26.958 --> 35:29.875
-[Brie on TV] He cheated on you.
-Oh, my God. You guys…

35:29.958 --> 35:31.666
Yeah. I do.

35:31.750 --> 35:34.000
-Diddly just exploded.
-So did Vroom Vroom.

35:34.083 --> 35:36.250
BASH News just sent me
eight push notifications.

35:36.333 --> 35:38.166
-About this?
-Yeah, look.

35:38.250 --> 35:40.708
My phone just purchased
DJ Chello's latest single.

35:40.791 --> 35:42.875
What the… It just did that without asking.

35:42.958 --> 35:45.791
I'm being told that
we have DJ Chello live on a Mugg link.

35:45.875 --> 35:48.791
-What's he got to say for himself?
-I love the producers here.

35:48.875 --> 35:50.125
Hey, baby doll. Hey.

35:50.208 --> 35:52.083
-Hi. Hi, baby. [crying]
-[Jack] He's in tears.

35:52.166 --> 35:54.083
-Your kid messed up bad.
-I know.

35:54.166 --> 35:56.666
Lady Baroque wasn't wearing
any panties in the club that night.

35:56.750 --> 35:58.416
-It's fine.
-I just got all crazy.

35:58.500 --> 36:00.416
I wasn't thinking straight.
I made a mistake.

36:00.500 --> 36:02.375
But, look, it's always been you.

36:02.458 --> 36:04.791
Oh! I get it. It's okay.

36:04.875 --> 36:07.583
I hooked up with her too,
last year at the Music Globes

36:07.666 --> 36:10.000
right before I ran off
with that power forward from the Nuggets,

36:10.083 --> 36:12.250
and none of that matters.

36:12.333 --> 36:15.916
What about "Forget breakup sex.
Try breakup relationship"?

36:16.000 --> 36:17.166
-That's good.
-Come on.

36:17.250 --> 36:20.166
"Ten famous second chances
for two-timers," guys.

36:20.250 --> 36:21.166
It's on a plate.

36:21.250 --> 36:25.125
I've been scared, but, honestly,
I'm not scared anymore.

36:25.208 --> 36:26.041
Okay.

36:26.125 --> 36:28.958
My little bumblebee, will you marry me?

36:29.041 --> 36:31.625
-[gasps] Oh, my God. Of course.
-[Jack] Oh, wow.

36:31.708 --> 36:33.208
-Chell, of course.
-[DJ Chello] Yes!

36:33.291 --> 36:35.416
-Yes!
-That's sick.

36:35.500 --> 36:36.333
[DJ Chello] Yes!

36:36.416 --> 36:38.791
All right, DJ Chello.

36:38.875 --> 36:40.875
-[cell phones vibrating]
-What is happening?

36:40.958 --> 36:41.916
Just bought another.

36:42.000 --> 36:44.916
-Who are these people again?
-They're like the biggest names…

36:45.000 --> 36:46.500
[Brie chuckles]

36:46.583 --> 36:49.625
Well, the fireworks
have certainly gone off today.

36:49.708 --> 36:50.875
-They have.
-What a zinger!

36:50.958 --> 36:52.458
[Jack] Yes, they have.

36:52.541 --> 36:55.250
From a wedding proposal
to a little science experiment.

36:55.333 --> 36:57.250
I'll need a temple rub
and a martini later on.

36:57.333 --> 37:02.041
[Brie] Our last guests today have made
a pretty big discovery in space.

37:02.125 --> 37:04.041
Astronomer Dr. Randall Mindy

37:04.125 --> 37:07.208
and PhD candidate
Miss Kate Dibiasky are here.

37:07.291 --> 37:08.333
Welcome to the show.

37:08.416 --> 37:11.583
Can I ask you one thing before we go
any further? I have to know this.

37:11.666 --> 37:14.208
Is there life out there?

37:14.291 --> 37:17.708
-Can you tell us? Yes or no, final answer.
-We don't have the data.

37:17.791 --> 37:19.958
But sure, in the vastness
of space, why not?

37:20.041 --> 37:21.541
Yes, aliens are real.

37:21.625 --> 37:24.166
I knew I'd like this guy.
Didn't I tell? You owe me 50 bucks.

37:24.250 --> 37:27.000
[Mindy] I'm not saying there's
little green men in flying saucers--

37:27.083 --> 37:30.208
-Please don't encourage him, Dr. Mindy.
-That's what he's saying.

37:30.291 --> 37:31.708
We'll never get out of here.

37:31.791 --> 37:33.541
Now, Jack was having some fun here.

37:33.625 --> 37:35.166
-Dad looks great.
-What did…

37:35.250 --> 37:37.583
-Doesn't he look good?
-They did something with his beard.

37:37.666 --> 37:39.583
[Brie] With the aliens…

37:39.666 --> 37:41.458
[chuckling] Really… He really does.

37:41.541 --> 37:43.625
-[Jack] So much.
-[Brie chuckles] Dr. Randall…

37:43.708 --> 37:47.125
You'll regret it. Now, look,
Jack's just having some fun here

37:47.208 --> 37:48.875
with the aliens or whatever,

37:48.958 --> 37:53.250
but there's a New York Herald story
that's just come out that talks about…

37:53.333 --> 37:55.375
Keep it right there. You're doing good.

37:55.458 --> 37:57.833
-…the two of you have made.
-[Mindy] That's right, Brie.

37:57.916 --> 38:00.958
Kate was, um, observing supernovas…

38:01.041 --> 38:02.583
Yo, that's your girl?

38:02.666 --> 38:05.083
-Yeah.
-Not bad.

38:05.166 --> 38:09.625
…an absolutely shocking
and once-in-a-lifetime discovery.

38:09.708 --> 38:13.000
I had no idea that Subaru made telescopes.

38:13.083 --> 38:16.166
This has to be exciting.
Tell us what you found, Miss Diabasky.

38:16.250 --> 38:20.250
Um, I was monitoring exploding stars

38:20.333 --> 38:26.750
to help measure
the expansion of the universe and--

38:26.833 --> 38:28.875
-For your PhD, right?
-Yeah.

38:28.958 --> 38:33.125
[Kate] I saw something I didn't recognize.

38:34.541 --> 38:36.041
It was a comet.

38:36.125 --> 38:36.958
[sighs]

38:37.041 --> 38:38.166
[Kate] A big one.

38:40.708 --> 38:44.583
It's headed directly at Earth,
and it really likely will hit.

38:45.916 --> 38:47.791
This sounds very, very exciting.

38:47.875 --> 38:50.458
Exploding stars, like,
stars actually explode.

38:50.541 --> 38:51.708
Um, how big is this thing?

38:51.791 --> 38:54.083
Can it destroy someone's house?
Is that possible?

38:54.166 --> 38:57.333
Well, Comet Dibiasky, which is
what it will officially be named--

38:57.416 --> 38:58.833
-[Jack] After her?
-Yeah, after her.

38:58.916 --> 39:01.583
-[Brie] Congratulations.
-[Jack] What an honor. Congratulations.

39:01.666 --> 39:04.166
It's somewhere between
six and nine kilometers across.

39:04.250 --> 39:05.583
-So--
-It's big.

39:05.666 --> 39:08.875
It would damage the entire planet.

39:08.958 --> 39:10.583
Not just a house, you know?

39:10.666 --> 39:11.708
The entire planet.

39:11.791 --> 39:14.708
Okay, as it's damaging,
will it hit this one house in particular

39:14.791 --> 39:17.875
that's right on the coast of New Jersey?
It's my ex-wife's house.

39:17.958 --> 39:19.208
Can we make that happen?

39:19.291 --> 39:21.708
You and Shelly have
a great relationship. Stop.

39:21.791 --> 39:23.125
You need to stop.

39:23.208 --> 39:26.125
I will, but in all fairness,
I actually paid for the house.

39:26.208 --> 39:27.500
[Brie] I'm so sorry.

39:27.583 --> 39:30.583
I'm sorry, are we not being clear?

39:31.916 --> 39:33.791
We're trying to tell you

39:33.875 --> 39:37.291
that the entire planet
is about to be destroyed.

39:37.958 --> 39:40.291
-[Jack] Okay, um…
-[Brie] Well, it's, you know…

39:40.375 --> 39:43.625
It's something we do around here.
We just keep the bad news light.

39:43.708 --> 39:45.625
Right. It helps the medicine go down.

39:45.708 --> 39:47.666
Speaking of medicine, tomorrow we've got--

39:47.750 --> 39:51.541
Well, maybe the destruction
of the entire planet

39:52.458 --> 39:53.833
isn't supposed to be fun.

39:54.625 --> 39:58.250
Maybe it's supposed to be terrifying.

39:58.333 --> 39:59.333
And unsettling.

39:59.416 --> 40:01.125
[Adul] No, please don't do that.

40:01.208 --> 40:03.333
-And you should stay up all night…
-[Adul] Please.

40:03.416 --> 40:05.250
…every night crying,

40:05.333 --> 40:09.750
when we're all 100%
for sure gonna fucking die!

40:10.500 --> 40:12.416
-[crying]
-Hey, Kate.

40:12.500 --> 40:13.500
[Kate] I'm sorry.

40:14.875 --> 40:15.708
Hey, man.

40:16.375 --> 40:19.708
My brother has bipolar disorder.
So if you ever need anyone to talk…

40:20.708 --> 40:22.583
-Uh… [inhales sharply]
-Okay.

40:22.666 --> 40:25.583
Is she always like that?

40:26.291 --> 40:28.083
-I--
-[Brie] Something I said?

40:28.166 --> 40:30.083
-[Jack and Brie chuckle]
-[Jack] Right?

40:30.166 --> 40:33.625
Maybe I should have given her
that extra Xanax that I had.

40:33.708 --> 40:34.708
[Jack and Brie chuckle]

40:34.791 --> 40:38.208
Listen, if you don't have enough,
we all have enough around here for her.

40:38.291 --> 40:41.166
A spoonful of Xanax
makes the medicine go down, right?

40:41.250 --> 40:42.916
[Jack] That's right. That's good.

40:43.916 --> 40:47.166
-We're gonna have to get you back.
-[Jack] I knew I'd like this guy.

40:47.250 --> 40:49.333
-Is he a plant? [laughing]
-[Jack] I knew it.

40:49.416 --> 40:50.333
[Brie] Okay.

40:50.416 --> 40:52.791
Well, the handsome astronomer

40:52.875 --> 40:56.375
can come back anytime,
but the yelling lady, not so much.

40:56.458 --> 40:59.416
[Jack] Not so much. Join us tomorrow
when our guest will be the man

40:59.500 --> 41:03.083
that many say will challenge
President Orlean in two years.

41:03.166 --> 41:05.166
Senator Jeff Lerner will be here.

41:05.250 --> 41:08.000
And wrongly-convicted murderer,
Michelle Weems,

41:08.083 --> 41:12.375
talks to us about her controversial
third-place finish on Celebrity Dance Off.

41:12.458 --> 41:15.833
-I thought she would've won.
-Yes. I still think she's guilty.

41:15.916 --> 41:18.083
-That's The Daily Rip, guys.
-[Brie] Have a great day.

41:18.666 --> 41:20.583
-[producer] And we're out!
-The show's over?

41:20.666 --> 41:21.958
-I mean, didn't…
-[Jack] Yeah.

41:22.041 --> 41:24.500
-Did what we wanted to say come across?
-No, it's over.

41:24.583 --> 41:28.500
You were great, but I think mullet girl,
she probably needs some media training.

41:29.625 --> 41:31.291
-Really?
-Yeah, no, terrible, buddy.

41:31.375 --> 41:33.916
[Brie] Oh… Thanks. Thanks, Billy.

41:34.000 --> 41:39.500
Uh, we usually get drinks at Aundrine's
after our five o'clock staff meeting.

41:39.583 --> 41:42.041
You know, it's fun. You should come.

41:42.125 --> 41:45.041
Oh, I'll have to see.
Thank you for the invitation. Thank you.

41:45.583 --> 41:46.583
Mmm-hmm.

41:47.916 --> 41:49.291
Kate? Kate?

41:49.375 --> 41:52.250
-Hey. You were awesome.
-Oh, thanks.

41:52.333 --> 41:54.291
Can I get a photo of you for my portfolio?

41:54.375 --> 41:55.666
-Yeah, sure.
-Thanks.

41:55.750 --> 41:57.083
-[camera clicks]
-Thank you.

41:57.666 --> 41:59.166
[woman] You can see this spike here

41:59.250 --> 42:01.375
is when Riley Bina
asked to take DJ Chello back

42:01.458 --> 42:02.750
on the segment before you.

42:02.833 --> 42:06.041
We saw engagement across
all social media platforms.

42:06.125 --> 42:08.916
Hmm. And what about our story?

42:09.000 --> 42:11.958
[woman] Randall and Kate,

42:12.041 --> 42:15.750
your TV appearance got some nice traffic
when Miss Dibiasky cursed.

42:15.833 --> 42:19.041
But, unfortunately,
there was an immediate backlash

42:19.125 --> 42:20.833
-that quickly became a meme.
-[Kate gasps]

42:20.916 --> 42:22.208
Oh, Jesus.

42:22.875 --> 42:26.250
-Oh, that's terrible.
-They just think I'm crazy.

42:26.333 --> 42:29.333
I mean, look at that.
That's so unnecessary.

42:30.708 --> 42:33.125
-You can move on, Erin.
-Yeah.

42:33.208 --> 42:35.916
That is just so…
Is that even allowed on the Internet or…

42:36.000 --> 42:37.625
I think that's Photoshop, Kate.

42:37.708 --> 42:40.083
[Erin] The trick is
to not take it personal…

42:40.166 --> 42:44.458
[chuckling] Dr. Mindy, on the other hand,
had some very high favorables.

42:44.541 --> 42:49.125
Vegan*Babe wrote,
"Meow! Me likey hunky Star Man."

42:49.208 --> 42:52.208
Uh, some accounts called him
"The Bedroom Eyes Doomsday Prophet"

42:52.291 --> 42:55.083
or A-I-L-F, which means
"astronomer I'd like to fuck."

42:55.166 --> 42:56.041
[people] Oh…

42:56.125 --> 42:58.666
I don't see what that has
to do with anything, do you?

42:59.375 --> 43:02.500
And that's everything.

43:02.583 --> 43:05.666
We did not feature or push on any sites,

43:05.750 --> 43:09.083
and clicks overall were below
basic weather and traffic stories.

43:09.166 --> 43:10.416
[scoffs]

43:10.500 --> 43:12.500
So that… That… That's it?

43:12.583 --> 43:14.333
-[Kate] I knew it.
-That's it.

43:15.250 --> 43:17.833
-Thank you, Erin.
-[Erin] Yeah, no problem.

43:18.500 --> 43:20.750
[Mindy] I don't… I don't understand.

43:20.833 --> 43:22.666
I don't understand. There's no response.

43:22.750 --> 43:27.375
There's absolutely no…
Why aren't people terrified?

43:27.458 --> 43:29.458
What do we have to say?
What do we have to do?

43:29.541 --> 43:32.916
There are scientists in Mexico and Spain
who are currently going through the data,

43:33.000 --> 43:34.708
and, uh, South Korea has expressed--

43:34.791 --> 43:36.500
-That's great. South Korea.
-Hey.

43:36.583 --> 43:39.041
Let us not bullshit each other.

43:39.125 --> 43:42.791
The bottom line is,
you guys told us the science was 100%.

43:42.875 --> 43:44.625
It's not. Now we look like idiots.

43:44.708 --> 43:47.291
-No. Who said the science is not 100%?
-Excuse me?

43:47.375 --> 43:50.250
I wanna talk to this person.
You tell me who said the science--

43:50.333 --> 43:53.333
Dr. Jocelyn Calder, the head of NASA,

43:53.416 --> 43:56.625
just came out calling it
"more near-miss hysteria."

43:56.708 --> 43:58.625
She's the one
who told us not to say anything.

43:58.708 --> 44:00.083
"More near-miss hysteria."

44:00.166 --> 44:01.291
Is she even an astronomer?

44:01.375 --> 44:04.458
She's the head of NASA, but maybe
she doesn't know what she's talking about.

44:04.541 --> 44:05.958
She's the head of NASA, but look,

44:06.041 --> 44:09.875
she's a "former anesthesiologist
and a President Orlean super donor."

44:09.958 --> 44:11.583
Let's not be dramatic here.

44:11.666 --> 44:12.666
It's all corrupt.

44:12.750 --> 44:16.416
Yes, but the point is that Adul's right.
There's still serious debate.

44:16.500 --> 44:18.708
And now the Herald has egg on its face.

44:18.791 --> 44:20.916
We've taken that story as far as it goes.

44:21.666 --> 44:25.625
Ladies, gentlemen,
I wish you a very pleasant end of times.

44:25.708 --> 44:27.708
[Mindy] It's not a goddamn story, okay?

44:30.208 --> 44:32.916
We have precisely six months, ten days,

44:33.000 --> 44:36.250
two hours, 11 minutes and 41 seconds,

44:36.333 --> 44:39.000
until a comet twice the size of Chicxulub

44:39.083 --> 44:41.833
tears through our atmosphere
and extincts all life on Earth.

44:41.916 --> 44:44.833
[chuckles] When did you
do those calculations?

44:45.666 --> 44:48.250
I put the moment of impact on a diet app.

44:48.333 --> 44:51.958
So, impact is when my diet ends.

44:52.041 --> 44:56.125
Only I'm not on a diet.
I'm just crying five times a day.

44:56.208 --> 44:58.125
-I'm scared.
-Hey, come on. Come on.

44:58.833 --> 45:01.416
Everyone should be
panicking right now, okay?

45:01.500 --> 45:03.416
-Don't cry. Come on.
-[Kate] I know.

45:03.500 --> 45:04.750
[cell phone chimes]

45:04.833 --> 45:05.833
[sighs]

45:06.833 --> 45:08.291
That prick!

45:08.375 --> 45:09.791
[upbeat tense music playing]

45:16.500 --> 45:17.666
[Mindy] What happened?

45:17.750 --> 45:20.083
Guess my boyfriend just broke up with me.

45:20.166 --> 45:24.500
-God, what a day. What a day…
-[crying]

45:32.666 --> 45:35.958
You're gonna die!
You're gonna die! You're…

45:36.041 --> 45:38.125
[slow rumbling]

45:46.291 --> 45:49.708
[reporter on TV] It started with
a photo many thought was an armpit

45:49.791 --> 45:52.458
or the chin of a man with a strange beard.

45:52.541 --> 45:54.833
But what's emerging now is a scandal…

45:54.916 --> 45:57.833
President Orlean sent
her Supreme Court nominee

45:57.916 --> 46:00.583
a cell phone picture of her private parts.

46:00.666 --> 46:02.708
-Holy crap!
-[woman] It's clickbait material.

46:02.791 --> 46:05.250
Is this what you want
in your country as a leader?

46:05.333 --> 46:07.708
Isn't she the same person
who told poor people

46:07.791 --> 46:11.833
that if they don't wanna be poor,
they should pick better lottery numbers?

46:11.916 --> 46:12.958
She actually said that.

46:13.041 --> 46:14.541
A source also confirmed to me that

46:14.625 --> 46:16.750
the two have been
having an affair for years.

46:16.833 --> 46:18.416
And as recently as yesterday…

46:18.500 --> 46:22.583
Members of my party
are currently drawing up a formal censure

46:22.666 --> 46:23.625
of the president,

46:24.583 --> 46:25.500
Janie Orlean…

46:25.583 --> 46:26.916
[Mindy] Oh, my God, honey.

46:27.000 --> 46:29.791
This guy doesn't even know
what a heliocentric orbit is,

46:29.875 --> 46:32.625
and he's calling me a crackpot. [chuckles]

46:32.708 --> 46:33.708
He says that,

46:34.541 --> 46:38.166
"Jewish billionaires
invented this comet threat

46:38.250 --> 46:42.125
so the government
can confiscate our liberty and our guns."

46:42.208 --> 46:45.500
"#DontBeScared." Unbelievable.

46:46.208 --> 46:47.041
My God.

46:47.125 --> 46:49.041
You've been on that site a lot lately.

46:49.625 --> 46:54.833
Yeah. I mean, I… I have, like,
a quarter million subscribers, honey.

46:54.916 --> 46:57.875
I gotta use my voice
to get the truth out there, right?

46:58.833 --> 47:01.916
I'm, uh, going for a walk
if you wanna come.

47:05.208 --> 47:07.750
[Mindy] It is called
the scientific method…

47:07.833 --> 47:08.666
[doorbell rings]

47:08.750 --> 47:11.666
…and it is what created the computer

47:11.750 --> 47:16.666
that you are typing
your half-witted conspiracy theories on.

47:18.125 --> 47:19.708
What do you think about that?

47:20.750 --> 47:21.958
[Mrs. Mindy] Randall?

47:22.750 --> 47:25.250
-Yeah, honey?
-Someone's here to see you.

47:25.916 --> 47:28.083
Who? Oh, boy.

47:31.416 --> 47:32.500
Oh, my gosh.

47:33.541 --> 47:35.458
Oh, God, right. Okay.

47:36.541 --> 47:37.375
Right.

47:37.875 --> 47:39.166
Are you Dr. Randall Mindy?

47:39.250 --> 47:40.416
[Mindy] Yes, sir. I am.

47:40.500 --> 47:41.708
[pensive music playing]

47:41.791 --> 47:43.833
[woman mockingly] "We're all gonna die."

47:43.916 --> 47:45.708
Fuck off, please.

47:48.750 --> 47:51.958
FBI! Freeze! Get on your knees right now!
Get on your knees!

47:52.708 --> 47:55.500
You're under arrest
for breach of national security secrets.

47:55.583 --> 47:56.458
Jesus Christ!

47:56.541 --> 48:00.125
You could've just called me
or showed up to my apartment.

48:01.208 --> 48:03.208
What are you, dressed up as a blind guy?

48:03.291 --> 48:05.583
[siren blaring]

48:05.666 --> 48:08.583
-[agent] Get on the ground!
-Okay. Now be cool.

48:09.541 --> 48:12.083
I just have
more skin pigmentation than you.

48:12.166 --> 48:15.083
'Cause your ancestors
migrated to Northern Europe

48:15.166 --> 48:17.250
and developed lighter skin
so as to not get…

48:19.500 --> 48:22.958
[Kate] Unless you assholes
are taking me to the Batcave,

48:23.041 --> 48:24.791
fuck you for putting this hood on me.

48:27.000 --> 48:29.541
Watch out for him.
He'll charge you for free shit.

48:30.208 --> 48:32.583
[whispers] What's he doing here?
Is he here for us?

48:33.250 --> 48:34.625
Gentlemen, you can come in.

48:39.208 --> 48:41.541
[Orlean chuckles] I think
it was Winston Churchill who…

48:41.625 --> 48:47.500
Or maybe it was Bobby Knight
who said, "The great labor of leadership

48:47.583 --> 48:51.083
is to lay down one's yoke of pride

48:51.833 --> 48:54.791
and admit that mistakes were made."

48:54.875 --> 48:58.041
[Jason] You were deceived,
as was I, but the end result was,

48:58.125 --> 49:01.791
we had our scientists who went to,
uh, the prestigious schools of Harvard,

49:01.875 --> 49:03.000
Princeton, et cetera.

49:03.500 --> 49:08.416
They confirmed the data.
So we would like to offer you a…

49:09.916 --> 49:12.000
presidential apology.

49:12.083 --> 49:13.000
Really?

49:13.750 --> 49:16.625
And we are fully prepared to mobilize

49:16.708 --> 49:19.583
in historic fashion
in order to save this planet.

49:19.666 --> 49:21.583
[laughing]

49:21.666 --> 49:23.875
[man] The best news
we've heard in a long time.

49:23.958 --> 49:27.541
So, basically, what you're saying is

49:27.625 --> 49:31.458
you're about to lose the midterms
'cause you got caught

49:31.541 --> 49:35.625
sending pictures of your cooch
to your porn-star sheriff boyfriend.

49:35.708 --> 49:39.625
So now it's to your advantage
to act on the comet?

49:41.541 --> 49:42.708
Right.

49:42.791 --> 49:44.041
[Kate] Okay.

49:44.666 --> 49:46.000
[chuckling] Okay. I'm just…

49:47.791 --> 49:51.041
[sighs] God, I'm so relieved
that you guys are doing something.

49:51.125 --> 49:54.708
-Hey, come on. Hey.
-This has been really…

49:54.791 --> 49:56.958
-[crying] Really, really hard.
-Come here.

49:57.041 --> 50:00.166
This has been really, really,
really stressful on all of us.

50:00.250 --> 50:01.291
Yes, I will agree.

50:01.375 --> 50:03.583
This will take some
heavy weight off all of us--

50:03.666 --> 50:06.583
[laughing] Sorry, you just look
so bad when you cry.

50:06.666 --> 50:08.458
[Orlean] Maybe, possibly.

50:08.541 --> 50:10.458
People are gonna ask
why we didn't act earlier.

50:10.541 --> 50:12.958
So you're gonna have
to take the hit on this one.

50:13.041 --> 50:16.083
Yeah, but we'll take care
of you down the road, Jocelyn.

50:16.750 --> 50:18.375
-We will.
-Of course, Janie.

50:19.000 --> 50:21.500
I will resign in disgrace
first thing tomorrow.

50:21.583 --> 50:24.291
-[Orlean] Good. Yeah, good.
-That's weird as hell.

50:24.375 --> 50:26.458
[whispers] She's an anesthesiologist.

50:26.541 --> 50:29.541
I'm going to make a statement,

50:29.625 --> 50:32.166
presidential statement
to the American people.

50:32.250 --> 50:35.041
And we're not gonna tell
the press about it ahead of time

50:35.125 --> 50:37.916
because that way
it will have the appearance

50:38.000 --> 50:39.666
of a breaking emergency sort of…

50:39.750 --> 50:42.166
[woman on TV] Good things
come to those who wait.

50:42.250 --> 50:44.166
-[device chimes on TV]
-[woman on TV] See?

50:44.250 --> 50:45.375
[man on TV] Whoo!

50:45.458 --> 50:47.125
Oh, my God!

50:47.208 --> 50:48.666
[cheers and applause on TV]

50:48.750 --> 50:50.041
[rhythmic music playing on TV]

50:50.125 --> 50:53.166
[man on TV] We interrupt this broadcast
of Jackpot Fiancé

50:53.250 --> 50:56.500
for an emergency message
from the president of the United States.

50:59.916 --> 51:02.875
Citizens of the United States
and peoples of the world,

51:03.458 --> 51:04.791
I have just been handed

51:04.875 --> 51:09.000
scientific findings that
confirm a worst-case scenario.

51:10.625 --> 51:14.833
An unprecedented comet,
nine kilometers wide,

51:14.916 --> 51:21.333
is now on a direct collision course
with our cherished home, planet Earth.

51:21.416 --> 51:24.666
Estimated time of arrival
is approximately five months from now.

51:24.750 --> 51:25.666
So we have…

51:25.750 --> 51:27.958
We've drawn up a massive
Congressional spending bill…

51:28.041 --> 51:31.791
I have already put together an emergency
spending package for Congress…

51:31.875 --> 51:34.083
[Jason] …that the Senate
and the House have agreed upon.

51:34.166 --> 51:35.000
That's good to hear.

51:35.083 --> 51:39.166
And that will enable NASA
and our great military

51:39.250 --> 51:41.083
to launch a preemptive strike,

51:42.541 --> 51:46.250
using decommissioned
space shuttles and satellites

51:46.333 --> 51:49.041
loaded with nuclear explosives.

51:49.125 --> 51:53.333
We will blow Comet Dibiasky
off her course…

51:53.416 --> 51:55.458
But we're gonna need a hero.

51:55.541 --> 51:58.791
We're gonna need a pilot, real guns and…

51:58.875 --> 52:02.250
Shouldn't this mission be accomplished
using remote technology?

52:02.333 --> 52:04.541
Washington's always gotta have a hero.

52:04.625 --> 52:06.000
I have asked

52:07.000 --> 52:13.000
Medal of Freedom recipient
and outspoken patriot, Benedict Drask,

52:13.083 --> 52:16.250
to undertake this difficult and…

52:16.333 --> 52:18.958
[Mindy] I'm sorry.
Isn't he the mercenary gentleman

52:19.041 --> 52:22.416
that was screaming at all those children
on the White House lawn?

52:22.500 --> 52:25.916
[Orlean] Yeah.
He was given the honor of leading

52:26.000 --> 52:29.333
the presidential initiative
in getting kids to exercise.

52:29.416 --> 52:31.250
Get a little air into it, you lard-ass…

52:32.000 --> 52:34.333
You look like a goddamn bunch of pussies.

52:34.416 --> 52:36.666
-[Mindy] I'm sorry.
-He's just of another generation.

52:36.750 --> 52:38.083
You know, I used to date him.

52:38.166 --> 52:41.375
Know what happened to the last pussy
I worked with in combat?

52:41.458 --> 52:43.250
You ever see inside a man's torso?

52:43.333 --> 52:44.916
[cheers and applause]

52:47.416 --> 52:49.541
Benedict Drask reporting for duty.

52:51.708 --> 52:53.791
-Thank you for the…
-He's gonna be fantastic.

52:53.875 --> 52:55.458
He's got a great voice.

52:55.541 --> 52:58.166
-We're gonna let him make a statement.
-Some are saying this is a…

52:58.250 --> 52:59.625
He's got a great body too.

52:59.708 --> 53:01.250
-[Calder] He does.
-[Orlean] Yeah.

53:01.333 --> 53:02.958
…suicide mission.

53:03.041 --> 53:04.458
Well, all I ask is,

53:05.541 --> 53:06.875
if I get snuffed,

53:08.041 --> 53:11.458
that you all earn
the extra living my sacrifice gives you.

53:11.541 --> 53:14.000
The extra living
my sacrifice gives them. [gasps]

53:14.625 --> 53:16.500
-Right?
-I wrote that.

53:16.583 --> 53:18.708
Isn't that from Saving Private Ryan?

53:18.791 --> 53:21.708
-Yes.
-No, that's something totally different.

53:21.791 --> 53:25.500
And special thanks should also go
to this team of scientists behind me…

53:25.583 --> 53:28.250
[Orlean] We're gonna need
everybody's help on this.

53:28.333 --> 53:30.208
Everybody.

53:30.291 --> 53:33.916
All have to pitch in
and push out this message.

53:34.000 --> 53:35.458
…African-American scientist.

53:35.541 --> 53:37.125
Miss Dibiasky, she…

53:37.208 --> 53:40.583
And we have Kate Dibiasky,
who the comet is named after,

53:40.666 --> 53:42.458
but don't blame her.

53:42.541 --> 53:46.166
…connects with the disaffected youth
and the mentally ill.

53:46.250 --> 53:48.125
-And other marginal groups.
-Thank you.

53:48.208 --> 53:51.500
-[Oglethorpe] We'll do whatever we can.
-As long as you do the right thing.

53:51.583 --> 53:52.916
We're there for you.

53:53.000 --> 53:56.250
Especially you, Dr. Mindy,
because you poll so much higher

53:56.333 --> 53:58.666
than your colleagues.
It's wild. [laughing]

53:58.750 --> 54:04.250
He will help us destroy
our common enemy, Dibiasky.

54:04.875 --> 54:07.041
Wonderful. Well, I think we're done.

54:07.125 --> 54:08.666
[Jason] Yep, okay. Let's go.

54:08.750 --> 54:10.291
[Kate] Can I say something?

54:10.375 --> 54:12.583
We've been dying to hear
what you gotta say.

54:13.250 --> 54:14.375
I didn't vote for you.

54:16.541 --> 54:22.708
But this is obviously
much bigger than my misgivings.

54:22.791 --> 54:27.125
So I will be 100% behind this effort.

54:28.000 --> 54:31.791
No matter how offensive I may find you.

54:31.875 --> 54:34.375
Hmm. Wow. That's great.

54:34.458 --> 54:36.291
[Jason] Yeah. That's really nice.

54:36.375 --> 54:39.208
You know, I did have the FBI
put that bag over your head.

54:39.291 --> 54:42.291
They don't do that.
The CIA does, but I made them do it.

54:42.375 --> 54:45.083
You know, I had a feeling. I really did.

54:45.958 --> 54:48.416
It's a good feeling
'cause that is what I did.

54:48.500 --> 54:51.291
-And it was very funny and cool. [laughs]
-[Orlean] Okay.

54:51.375 --> 54:55.458
May Jesus Christ
bless every single one of you,

54:56.208 --> 54:59.333
especially the honorable members
of my own party.

55:00.000 --> 55:01.125
We will prevail.

is seriously stressing me out.

Well, it's coming. People gotta dig in.

Hello, Sammy.

56:25.125 --> 56:28.416
[laughing] Are you really a doctor?

56:28.500 --> 56:31.750
Well, sort of. I'm an astronomer.

56:31.833 --> 56:35.833
Oh. What is an astronomer?

56:35.916 --> 56:38.708
[Jack] Dr. Mindy, there is
a lot of fear out there,

56:38.791 --> 56:40.541
uh, in America, around the world.

56:40.625 --> 56:42.708
Parents don't know
what to say to their kids.

56:42.791 --> 56:45.291
What would you say to them
to help them understand?

56:45.375 --> 56:48.791
[clicks tongue] Well, I'm sure many of us
are frightened right now.

56:49.458 --> 56:55.708
But I can assure you, our best
and our brightest, they're on the job.

56:56.250 --> 57:00.458
I've seen the science
on this plan and it is sound.

57:00.541 --> 57:05.208
I know your words are a great comfort
to all our viewers, Dr. Randall,

57:05.291 --> 57:09.416
and we thank you
for your courage and your service.

57:09.500 --> 57:11.166
I'd just like to say

57:11.791 --> 57:16.541
that whenever
I feel afraid or alone in this, I…

57:17.833 --> 57:21.000
I think of you and I just… I feel better.

57:21.083 --> 57:22.375
So thank you.

That's my job.

57:35.458 --> 57:37.583
-Tell me we're all gonna die.
-What?

57:37.666 --> 57:39.000
[both breathing heavily]

57:39.083 --> 57:39.916
[grunting]

57:40.000 --> 57:42.500
-Tell me we're all gonna die, do it.
-We're all gonna die.

57:42.583 --> 57:43.708
-[moans]
-Oh, boy.

57:43.791 --> 57:47.375
[man on TV] So, these two Marxists
wave around the word "science"

57:47.458 --> 57:49.583
and we're all supposed
to do whatever they say?

57:49.666 --> 57:52.291
Yeah, how do we know
there even is a comet?

57:52.375 --> 57:56.125
Mr. Pawketty, Congressman,
this data has been proven

57:56.208 --> 58:00.458
and has been peer-reviewed
by hundreds of world-renowned scientists.

58:00.541 --> 58:04.541
And we're supposed to trust you?
The comet's got your name.

58:05.958 --> 58:07.916
I don't… I don't see the relevancy.

58:08.000 --> 58:09.791
[Pawketty] Why won't you
answer the question?

58:09.875 --> 58:11.916
-Answer the question.
-What's the question?

58:12.000 --> 58:13.125
Grow up here, okay?

58:13.208 --> 58:14.416
This is ridiculous.

58:16.416 --> 58:20.416
I've just realized, we don't really know
anything about each other. Do we?

58:21.000 --> 58:22.041
[chuckles]

58:22.125 --> 58:23.083
True.

58:24.291 --> 58:27.666
Well, every time I try
to ask you about your life,

58:27.750 --> 58:31.416
you seem to just tell me
about your favorite restaurants.

58:32.375 --> 58:33.541
Well, I… You know…

58:34.250 --> 58:36.041
I just despise the, you know,

58:36.125 --> 58:38.291
getting-to-know-you part
of relationships, so…

58:38.958 --> 58:41.000
Oh, okay. I understand.

58:43.000 --> 58:45.208
Okay, let's just
get it over and done with.

58:47.708 --> 58:48.916
Okay, uh…

58:49.958 --> 58:51.708
Right, so, uh…

58:52.375 --> 58:56.833
My grandfather invented
the flash-freezing process.

58:56.916 --> 58:59.166
So I come from grotesque money,

58:59.250 --> 59:03.500
but I got away from it
by getting three masters degrees.

59:04.291 --> 59:07.125
Uh, I've been divorced twice.

59:07.208 --> 59:13.708
Uh, one was a Secretary of State,
and the other one was a sport fisherman.

59:13.791 --> 59:19.666
Uh, I have slept
with two former presidents.

59:19.750 --> 59:24.583
I speak four languages,
and I own two Monets.

59:26.291 --> 59:27.125
Wow.

59:27.750 --> 59:29.958
Two former presidents. Wow.

59:31.958 --> 59:33.875
-What, my turn?
-[chuckles] Yeah.

59:33.958 --> 59:40.250
Oh. All right. My father was
a middle school geography teacher.

59:40.333 --> 59:43.583
My mother,
she cut hair out of the kitchen.

59:43.666 --> 59:47.500
Uh, about two years ago,
our family dog, JoJo, died,

59:47.583 --> 59:49.583
which was really, really emotional.

59:49.666 --> 59:53.041
I can't remember crying that much ever.

59:54.583 --> 59:55.541
And, um…

59:57.250 --> 1:00:02.541
I finally got my, uh, Star Wars poster
signed by Mark Hamill.

1:00:02.625 --> 1:00:04.708
It's in the garage. It's… So, yeah.

1:00:05.583 --> 1:00:07.666
Okay, good.

1:00:08.208 --> 1:00:09.041
[chuckles]

1:00:09.958 --> 1:00:10.958
That's done.

1:00:11.458 --> 1:00:12.416
[Mindy] Ah…

1:00:15.666 --> 1:00:17.958
Where are we gonna go for dinner tonight?

1:00:22.916 --> 1:00:25.083

1:00:26.333 --> 1:00:28.916
The Lord is my shepherd. I shall not want.

1:00:29.000 --> 1:00:31.750
He makes me to lie down in green pastures.

1:00:31.833 --> 1:00:36.083
He leads me beside the quiet waters.
He restores my soul.

1:00:36.166 --> 1:00:39.583
Not since D-Day have we seen
such a mass mobilization

1:00:39.666 --> 1:00:43.416
of unions and resources
for such a noble task.

1:00:44.041 --> 1:00:46.916
One cannot help but be moved
by the bravery, ingenuity,

1:00:47.000 --> 1:00:49.083
and sacrifice on display here.

1:01:09.541 --> 1:01:12.125
Okay, here we go, everyone.
Let's stay sharp.

1:01:14.041 --> 1:01:17.416
[whispers] I just want you to know,
this is the most propulsive thing

1:01:17.500 --> 1:01:20.041
that's ever happened to me. Thank you.

1:01:29.416 --> 1:01:31.250
[indistinct chatter on TV]

1:01:33.333 --> 1:01:36.541
What's the holdup, you guys?
What are you waiting on?

1:01:37.500 --> 1:01:40.625
Come on, motherfuckers,
let's light this fucking firecracker, huh?

1:01:41.166 --> 1:01:42.541
Think I got all day?

1:01:42.625 --> 1:01:47.208
Commander Drask,
this is your president speaking.

1:01:48.458 --> 1:01:50.333
Your nation thanks you.

1:01:51.083 --> 1:01:52.708
Your planet thanks you.

1:01:53.416 --> 1:01:55.875
And God and I thank you.

1:01:56.583 --> 1:01:59.208
[Drask] Listen, the only thanks I need
is a shot of Jack Daniels.

1:01:59.291 --> 1:02:03.208

-And a couple DUIs to magically go away.

1:02:03.291 --> 1:02:05.000

1:02:05.083 --> 1:02:08.916
This is Mission Control.
All indicators are coming up green.

1:02:09.000 --> 1:02:11.416
This is a final warning
to control the launchpad.

1:02:11.500 --> 1:02:17.208
Your discovery led to this mission
and our chance to save Earth.

1:02:18.375 --> 1:02:19.666
I give you…

1:02:22.041 --> 1:02:23.041
the honor.

1:02:28.458 --> 1:02:29.458
Thank you.

1:02:31.666 --> 1:02:34.958

Citizens of planet Earth,

1:02:39.875 --> 1:02:43.041
everything is theoretically impossible

1:02:43.708 --> 1:02:45.125
until it is done.

1:02:46.250 --> 1:02:47.541
And with that,

1:02:47.625 --> 1:02:49.750
we are go for launch.

1:02:49.833 --> 1:02:50.708
Yes.

1:02:50.791 --> 1:02:52.458
-[Jason] That's fire.
-Thank you.

1:02:52.541 --> 1:02:53.541

Hi. Oh, Brie, you look fabulous.

Yes, it is. It means, "the angels soar
to the heavens." It's, um…

1:05:38.333 --> 1:05:42.458
It's from a 14th-century poem
I studied in Dartmouth.

it just made me think of it,

1:05:47.000 --> 1:05:48.416

It's pretty standard.

what could've happened.

I mean, the mission was working, right?
Everything was on track.

1:07:23.333 --> 1:07:26.166
Yeah. I mean,
it could've been anything, uh…

uh, nuke destabilized, myriad of things.

Dr. Randall, you are now the Chief
Science Advisor to the White House.

1:07:57.000 --> 1:07:57.833
What?

1:07:57.916 --> 1:08:00.666
As such, you need to attend
an emergency Cabinet meeting

1:08:00.750 --> 1:08:02.000
where you will be debriefed.

1:08:02.083 --> 1:08:03.083
What about us?

You do not have clearance
for this, sweetheart. Don't trip.

1:08:06.250 --> 1:08:09.000
Got you some crackers, some waters.

1:08:09.083 --> 1:08:10.750
You don't need to throw it on the floor.

1:08:10.833 --> 1:08:12.375
Gonna be three, four hours, tops.

Here, Kate. I don't know
why he threw 'em down. Here.

1:08:15.666 --> 1:08:17.750
What if we have to go to the bathroom?

1:08:17.833 --> 1:08:21.250
We'll lay out some newspaper for you.
Grab you a can of Febreze.

1:08:21.333 --> 1:08:23.208
[Oglethorpe] Short, sweet
and simple science.

1:08:23.291 --> 1:08:24.958
I'll be back. All right. Come on.

1:08:25.041 --> 1:08:27.083
[Oglethorpe]
Science tells the truth, Randall.

1:08:27.833 --> 1:08:28.791
[sighs]

1:08:28.875 --> 1:08:30.500
Fuck. Do you wanna come?

1:08:30.583 --> 1:08:31.500
Yeah.

1:08:33.625 --> 1:08:35.625
[Orlean] Ladies and gentlemen,
what we thought,

1:08:35.708 --> 1:08:40.708
what the world thought
was an impending and terrifying danger,

1:08:41.916 --> 1:08:44.625
turns out to be
an astonishing opportunity.

1:08:44.708 --> 1:08:47.166
Our allies are very confused
and demanding answers--

1:08:47.250 --> 1:08:48.541
Well, tell 'em to wait.

1:08:49.583 --> 1:08:54.666
According to the most recent
spectrometer readings of Comet Dibiasky,

1:08:54.750 --> 1:08:57.833
made by the astrogeologists
at BASH Cellular,

1:08:59.583 --> 1:09:01.291
we've discovered something.

Something truly miraculous.

-Oh, thank you, Janie.
-[chuckles]

As, uh… As some of you may know,

1:09:14.791 --> 1:09:17.541
the most valuable minerals in the world

1:09:17.625 --> 1:09:19.750
are fast becoming those that are deployed

1:09:19.833 --> 1:09:24.000
in the manufacture
of cell phones and, uh, computers.

1:09:24.083 --> 1:09:27.583
Yttrium, terbium, osmium, dysprosium,
on and on and on.

1:09:27.666 --> 1:09:29.000
We're running short.

1:09:29.083 --> 1:09:31.916
Uh, and the problem
is exacerbated, of course,

1:09:32.000 --> 1:09:37.916
because China has her big panda paw
firmly on almost all the mines

1:09:38.000 --> 1:09:41.500
that produce
these valuable rare Earth assets.

1:09:41.583 --> 1:09:43.625
So you can imagine. [laughing]

1:09:43.708 --> 1:09:44.666
Wow!

1:09:44.750 --> 1:09:48.541
Just how happy we were at BASH

1:09:48.625 --> 1:09:52.250
when our astrogeologists discovered

1:09:52.333 --> 1:09:57.000
and then determined that this comet,
hurtling towards us from deep space,

1:09:57.083 --> 1:10:02.833
actually contains at least $32 trillion
of these critical materials.

1:10:02.916 --> 1:10:04.666
Critical to technology.

1:10:04.750 --> 1:10:05.958
If we're to proceed--

1:10:06.041 --> 1:10:08.541
I'm sorry. Is that why
you aborted this entire mission,

1:10:08.625 --> 1:10:11.541
is because you're trying to mine
the comet for rare minerals?

1:10:11.625 --> 1:10:13.708
[Orlean] I think
we should hold all questions

1:10:13.791 --> 1:10:16.458
until the end of the presentation,

1:10:16.541 --> 1:10:20.125
and you might find
that your questions are answered.

1:10:20.666 --> 1:10:21.750
Yes, Madam President.

1:10:21.833 --> 1:10:24.875
When you…
When the other metals are factored in,

1:10:24.958 --> 1:10:27.333
the comet actually contains

1:10:27.416 --> 1:10:31.541
almost $140 trillion worth of assets.

1:10:31.625 --> 1:10:32.916
[Jason] Buck-forty trilli.

1:10:33.416 --> 1:10:35.291
-[Orlean] Yeah…
-[laughter]

1:10:35.375 --> 1:10:40.000
What do these trillions of dollars
even matter if we're all gonna die--

1:10:40.083 --> 1:10:42.458
[woman] I was about to ask
the same question, Janie.

1:10:42.541 --> 1:10:43.666
Why weren't we consulted?

1:10:43.750 --> 1:10:45.250
All due respect, Madam President…

1:10:45.333 --> 1:10:47.833
Oh, no! What if we're rich and we're safe?

1:10:49.000 --> 1:10:53.125
[Kate] I've gone over it
again and again and again in my head

1:10:54.875 --> 1:10:56.791
and I still can't make sense of it.

1:10:58.750 --> 1:11:03.791
He's a three-star general.
He works at the Pentagon.

1:11:05.916 --> 1:11:09.000
Why would he charge us for free snacks?

1:11:09.083 --> 1:11:12.750
One time, I met Sting,

1:11:13.708 --> 1:11:18.291
and I swear to God,
he farted right in front of me.

1:11:19.333 --> 1:11:24.458
Didn't break eye contact
and didn't even say "excuse me."

1:11:27.500 --> 1:11:31.083
And the thing is,
he actually pulled it off. [chuckles]

1:11:32.375 --> 1:11:34.875
'Cause I still found him
to be quite charming.

1:11:35.916 --> 1:11:40.333
[whispering] Guys, we have to talk.
Come on, let's go. Come on, now.

1:11:41.416 --> 1:11:44.625
It's insane. Like, completely insane.

1:11:44.708 --> 1:11:46.041
[Kate] It will never work.

1:11:46.125 --> 1:11:48.291
I had the exact same reaction.

1:11:48.375 --> 1:11:51.500
This is a nine-kilometer-wide
planet-killer we're talking about,

1:11:51.583 --> 1:11:53.041
not roaming charges.

1:11:53.125 --> 1:11:59.041
Look, I… I was confused and outraged
that they turned this mission around too,

1:11:59.125 --> 1:12:01.708
but they've got
Gary Talcamont from Stanford

1:12:01.791 --> 1:12:03.958
and Lisa Inez from Princeton
on their team.

1:12:04.041 --> 1:12:07.750
I mean, this is next-generation
cutting-edge technology.

1:12:07.833 --> 1:12:14.625
Obviously, one giant comet is a major
and existential, uh, threat to our planet,

1:12:14.708 --> 1:12:20.000
but 30 smaller meteoroids, we can handle.

1:12:20.916 --> 1:12:26.625
Our BEADS, that stands for
BASH, uh, Explore and Acquire Drones,

1:12:26.708 --> 1:12:28.083
that you see here,

1:12:28.166 --> 1:12:30.833
attach themselves to the comet

1:12:30.916 --> 1:12:33.375
and scan it with nanotechnology

1:12:33.458 --> 1:12:36.583
developed by
Nobel Prize-winning scientist,

1:12:36.666 --> 1:12:37.666
Dr. Gary Talcamont.

1:12:37.750 --> 1:12:40.500
And then we immediately deploy, don't we?

1:12:40.583 --> 1:12:42.833
Nobel and Polonsky prize-winning scientist

1:12:42.916 --> 1:12:48.250
Dr. Inez's micro-targeted,
quantum fission, uh, explosives.

1:12:48.333 --> 1:12:51.625
You see, deep into the object…

1:12:51.708 --> 1:12:54.458
Dr. Inez, would you like
to explain what's happening?

1:12:54.541 --> 1:12:55.416
Thank you, Peter.

1:12:55.500 --> 1:12:58.250
We've been developing
phase-fission reactions

1:12:58.333 --> 1:13:00.375
in the CERN particle accelerator

1:13:00.458 --> 1:13:03.125
that can splinter the comet
into smaller pieces

1:13:03.208 --> 1:13:05.333
with breathtaking accuracy.

1:13:05.416 --> 1:13:08.791
These segments are then steered
and decelerated by each BEAD

1:13:08.875 --> 1:13:13.625
into the Pacific Ocean for reclamation
by waiting US Navy ships.

1:13:13.708 --> 1:13:15.666
And when these… Thank you.

1:13:15.750 --> 1:13:19.875
And when these treasures
from heaven are claimed,

1:13:19.958 --> 1:13:23.916
poverty as we know it,
social injustice, loss of biodiversity,

1:13:24.000 --> 1:13:26.708
all these multitudes of problems

1:13:26.791 --> 1:13:30.125
are just gonna become relics of the past

1:13:30.208 --> 1:13:35.625
and humanity is gonna stride through
the Pillars of Boaz and Jachin naked

1:13:35.708 --> 1:13:38.250
into the the glory of a golden age…

1:13:38.333 --> 1:13:41.500
And is this nanotech work peer-reviewed?

1:13:41.583 --> 1:13:45.166
Well, I haven't reviewed the data,
but it's been modeled.

1:13:45.250 --> 1:13:47.125
Has any of this been peer-reviewed?

1:13:48.000 --> 1:13:48.833
Nope.

1:13:48.916 --> 1:13:51.250
Interplanetary, interstellar,

1:13:51.333 --> 1:13:56.125
intergalactic existence
for the human race.

1:13:56.208 --> 1:13:57.583
[applause]

1:13:59.125 --> 1:14:00.916
[Orlean] Your mouth to God's ear.

1:14:01.458 --> 1:14:05.041
I understand the wealth
that they can extract from this comet,

1:14:05.125 --> 1:14:06.291
it can end world hunger.

1:14:06.375 --> 1:14:08.166
-[Oglethorpe] Oh, I see.
-[Kate laughing]

1:14:08.250 --> 1:14:10.833
-Why are you laughing?
-[Oglethorpe] That's true. No, I see.

1:14:10.916 --> 1:14:15.333
So that's the pretty little bow they're
putting around this line of bullshit.

1:14:15.416 --> 1:14:17.250
I bet they'll say freedom and puppies too.

1:14:17.333 --> 1:14:18.166
-All right.
-Yeah.

1:14:18.250 --> 1:14:21.916
You want me to quit the mission?
I'll quit the mission. That's fine.

1:14:22.416 --> 1:14:25.708
But you have to understand,
this is now beyond our control.

1:14:25.791 --> 1:14:27.208
They have all the power.

1:14:27.291 --> 1:14:29.958
So who do you want
in the actual room to make sure

1:14:30.041 --> 1:14:33.000
this whole thing doesn't turn out to be
a complete goddamn disaster?

1:14:33.083 --> 1:14:35.708
Jason Orlean?
You want Jason Orlean in that room? Huh?

1:14:35.791 --> 1:14:40.125
I have news for you.
It's already a complete disaster.

1:14:40.208 --> 1:14:43.750
They're talking about letting
a comet the size of a mountain

1:14:43.833 --> 1:14:46.625
hit the planet to jack up
a cell phone company's stock!

1:14:46.708 --> 1:14:49.916
You better take that down
about four or five notches now.

1:14:50.000 --> 1:14:53.625
Were you yelling about that mission?
Why were you talking about cell phones?

1:14:53.708 --> 1:14:56.750
My friend was just theorizing
as to what's going on.

1:14:56.833 --> 1:14:58.291
We're confused too.

1:14:58.375 --> 1:15:01.458
That's an awfully official-looking
White House badge you got there.

1:15:01.541 --> 1:15:03.291
I don't know why I have this on.

1:15:03.375 --> 1:15:05.125
Listen, just tell us what's going on.

1:15:05.208 --> 1:15:07.625
I got three scared kids at home.
Just tell us something.

1:15:07.708 --> 1:15:10.333
I understand.
I wish I could share information, but--

1:15:10.416 --> 1:15:12.958
We're people just like you.
We deserve to know!

1:15:13.041 --> 1:15:13.916
They're right.

1:15:14.958 --> 1:15:16.083
They deserve to know.

1:15:17.000 --> 1:15:18.833
Do you really wanna know what's going on?

1:15:18.916 --> 1:15:20.041
-[woman] Yeah.
-[man] Please.

1:15:20.125 --> 1:15:22.583
-[Oglethorpe] Kate, don't. Kate.
-[Mindy] Kate.

1:15:23.541 --> 1:15:28.958
They found a bunch of gold and diamonds
and rare shit on the comet.

1:15:29.041 --> 1:15:29.875
[sighs]

1:15:29.958 --> 1:15:32.166
So they're gonna let it hit the planet

1:15:32.250 --> 1:15:36.416
to make a bunch of rich people
even more disgustingly rich!

1:15:42.916 --> 1:15:44.000
[woman] Fuck you!

1:15:44.083 --> 1:15:46.083
[people clamoring]

1:15:47.458 --> 1:15:49.250
[people shouting and screaming]

1:15:54.708 --> 1:15:56.500
[officer] No camera!

1:15:56.583 --> 1:15:58.541
…everything I could, they won't listen.

1:15:58.625 --> 1:15:59.958
[Kate] Surprise, surprise.

1:16:00.041 --> 1:16:02.916
Now, I'm starting to think
you just like riling people up.

1:16:03.000 --> 1:16:04.958
I'm so sorry, Kate. Really, I am.

1:16:05.041 --> 1:16:07.041
[Kate] Oh, Randall. God.

1:16:07.875 --> 1:16:09.875
Where's Brie Evantee?

1:16:09.958 --> 1:16:12.375
Shouldn't you two
be playing footsie in a restaurant

1:16:12.458 --> 1:16:14.583
that only serves cubes and foam?

1:16:14.666 --> 1:16:18.083
Well, she ain't wrong.
You did lose the thread in a big way.

1:16:18.166 --> 1:16:21.375
And what do you suggest we do?
An online petition, huh?

1:16:21.458 --> 1:16:24.416
You want to hold…
Get a mob and hold up picket signs?

1:16:24.500 --> 1:16:26.958
You wanna overthrow the government?
I mean, look at this.

1:16:27.041 --> 1:16:28.875
[Kate] I can't! My head is in a bag!

1:16:28.958 --> 1:16:31.583
[agent] Sorry, Dr. Mindy.
White House wants her off the grid.

1:16:31.666 --> 1:16:33.166
-Come on, now. Look--
-[agent] Now.

1:16:33.250 --> 1:16:35.958
[Kate] Wait. What does that mean?
What the hell does that mean?

1:16:36.041 --> 1:16:38.416
-What does "off the grid" mean?
-[Mindy] Hey, Kate.

1:16:39.291 --> 1:16:42.416
Oh, gosh. Kate! Are you okay?

1:16:42.500 --> 1:16:45.458
[people shouting indistinctly]

1:16:45.541 --> 1:16:48.833
Teddy, come on!
What choice do I have here?

1:16:51.166 --> 1:16:53.541
A man's always got choices, Randall!

1:16:53.625 --> 1:16:56.458
Sometimes you just gotta
choose the good one!

1:16:56.541 --> 1:16:57.791
[dog barking]

1:16:57.875 --> 1:17:00.041
[uneasy music playing]

1:17:03.083 --> 1:17:04.708
[man] Miss Katelyn Dibiasky,

1:17:04.791 --> 1:17:08.208
the charges against you are
violation of national security secrets,

1:17:08.291 --> 1:17:11.083
inciting a riot,
and destruction of private property

1:17:11.166 --> 1:17:13.666
owned by Bojo Mambo's Shrimp LLC.

1:17:13.750 --> 1:17:14.583
What? I didn't--

1:17:14.666 --> 1:17:17.583
However, the Attorney General
is willing to not pursue prosecution

1:17:17.666 --> 1:17:19.208
if you will agree to the following:

1:17:19.291 --> 1:17:21.958
"The suspension
of all public media appearances

1:17:22.041 --> 1:17:26.708
and incendiary language relating to
Comet Dibiasky and BASH Cellular."

1:17:28.916 --> 1:17:32.333
Fine. Give it to me.
I don't give a shit anymore.

1:17:47.875 --> 1:17:49.416
Mom. Dad.

1:17:49.916 --> 1:17:52.166
[sniffles] I'm so glad to be home.

1:17:54.875 --> 1:17:55.875
Unlock the door.

1:17:55.958 --> 1:17:57.750
No politics. None.

1:17:58.208 --> 1:17:59.583
What are you talking about?

1:18:00.083 --> 1:18:02.791
Your dad and I are for the jobs
the comet will provide.

1:18:04.125 --> 1:18:05.041
[Kate scoffs]

1:18:05.708 --> 1:18:07.916
The divisions in this country
are bad enough.

1:18:08.625 --> 1:18:10.458
We don't want more of that in our house.

1:18:11.916 --> 1:18:14.208
-[serene music playing on TV]
-[laughing] Whoa!

1:18:14.291 --> 1:18:16.125
-Slow down, kids.
-[boy] Sorry, Mom.

1:18:17.291 --> 1:18:19.333
I worry about my kids and their future.

1:18:19.875 --> 1:18:22.500
Sure, the jobs
the comet's gonna create sound great.

1:18:23.041 --> 1:18:24.291
What if it's not safe?

1:18:24.875 --> 1:18:29.250
Right now, millions of you are having
these same doubts and questions

1:18:29.333 --> 1:18:31.208
about the approaching comet.

1:18:31.291 --> 1:18:32.708
That is why BASH Cellular

1:18:32.791 --> 1:18:35.166
in conjunction with
the United States Government

1:18:35.250 --> 1:18:40.041
is creating a new hotline, free of charge,
to answer all of your questions.

1:18:40.750 --> 1:18:46.125
And who knows? Maybe,
just maybe, one of our scientists…

1:18:46.208 --> 1:18:49.541
Thank you, Sharon.
Makes me feel so much better.

1:18:49.625 --> 1:18:53.833
…can be that friend we all need
to lean on during uncertain times.

1:18:55.208 --> 1:18:58.750
[announcer on TV]
Call 1-800-532-4500 for peace of mind.

1:18:58.833 --> 1:19:00.458
Offer only available to BASH customers.

1:19:00.541 --> 1:19:02.916
Details of your call may be shared
with other subsidiaries

1:19:03.000 --> 1:19:05.916
to enhance your customer experience.
Data and roaming charges apply.

1:19:06.000 --> 1:19:09.416
[Brie laughing] So, I thought he was
the ambassador. I was just flattering him.

1:19:09.500 --> 1:19:13.541
[chuckling] Well, he was a waiter.
Now he's got an ego the size of Texas.

1:19:16.916 --> 1:19:18.125
Oh, my God.

1:19:19.250 --> 1:19:22.875
June, what, uh…
What are you doing here, sweetie?

1:19:24.708 --> 1:19:27.458
Had a feeling
something was going on and just…

1:19:28.333 --> 1:19:31.958
[Mindy] Well, you know,
we're discussing important business.

1:19:32.041 --> 1:19:35.458
-That's what we're doing.
-Oh, yeah, that's really very important.

1:19:35.541 --> 1:19:37.750
Oh, can we just
skip past this part, please?

1:19:37.833 --> 1:19:39.500
Where you get to feel self-righteous

1:19:39.583 --> 1:19:43.041
and we put our tails between our legs.
It is just so boring.

1:19:43.125 --> 1:19:44.791
[sarcastically] Oh, it's "so boring"?

1:19:44.875 --> 1:19:49.291
You wanna skip the part where
you feel bad for screwing my husband?

1:19:49.875 --> 1:19:52.583
Oh… No, I don't feel bad.

1:19:52.666 --> 1:19:56.416
Randall and I are having a wonderful time.
So, I think the question is,

1:19:56.500 --> 1:20:01.791
do we keep having a wonderful time
or does he go back with you to Wisconsin?

1:20:01.875 --> 1:20:02.750
Or Montana.

1:20:02.833 --> 1:20:04.875
-Michigan?
-Michigan.

1:20:06.791 --> 1:20:08.041
[hesitates]

1:20:08.125 --> 1:20:12.500
You know, um… she is actually right.

1:20:13.291 --> 1:20:16.333
That's the only question. So…

1:20:18.958 --> 1:20:20.750
[Mindy] Well, June, sweetie…

1:20:20.833 --> 1:20:23.875
[breathing heavily]
Sometimes in life things are, you know,

1:20:23.958 --> 1:20:26.458
they're complicated and they just--

1:20:26.541 --> 1:20:27.666
[Mrs. Mindy] Oh, okay.

1:20:29.958 --> 1:20:31.666
Oh, that was fast, um…

1:20:32.833 --> 1:20:33.791
[clicks tongue]

1:20:35.250 --> 1:20:38.375
Well, before I go, um,

1:20:38.458 --> 1:20:41.375
let me just give you some instructions

1:20:42.333 --> 1:20:45.458
on how to take care of Randall.

1:20:46.083 --> 1:20:47.041
Uh…

1:20:47.125 --> 1:20:50.541
Yeah, here's the Xanax
he takes for his panic attacks.

1:20:50.625 --> 1:20:51.458
Oh, gosh.

1:20:51.541 --> 1:20:54.458
Here's the Zoloft he takes
for the crashing depressions.

1:20:54.541 --> 1:20:58.250
-Not so much recently. Okay, you know--
-Oh! Oh, good for you. Great.

1:20:58.333 --> 1:21:02.000
-Uh, this is for his blood pressure.
-Ow.

1:21:02.083 --> 1:21:04.708
-Restless leg syndrome, that's a fun one.
-God.

1:21:06.708 --> 1:21:10.875
Oh. Appetite suppressant to counteract
the weight gain from his other meds.

1:21:10.958 --> 1:21:15.875
And, uh, for America's sexiest scientist,
a bottle of goddamn Cialis!

1:21:15.958 --> 1:21:17.375
Ow! Gosh.

1:21:26.583 --> 1:21:28.041
Goodbye. Goodbye, Randall.

1:21:28.125 --> 1:21:29.916
I guess I'll just tell your sons

1:21:30.000 --> 1:21:32.375
that Dad's fucking
the lady on our television.

1:21:33.416 --> 1:21:34.791
June, I…

1:21:36.250 --> 1:21:38.458
I really thought for a second
that was gonna work out.

1:21:38.541 --> 1:21:40.250
-[door closes]
-[sighs]

1:21:40.333 --> 1:21:43.666
People, they wanna
manage the comet to create jobs.

1:21:43.750 --> 1:21:45.791
Thirty-seven percent
don't want the comet to hit.

1:21:45.875 --> 1:21:47.583
That's actually down by three points.

1:21:47.666 --> 1:21:50.791
And 23%, they don't think
there's a comet at all,

1:21:50.875 --> 1:21:52.666
and that number is way up.

1:21:53.500 --> 1:21:56.791
Not Bitcoin, RatCoin. RatCoin.

1:21:56.875 --> 1:21:58.833
[indistinct chatter on TV]

1:21:59.583 --> 1:22:01.833
I'd like to buy these sunglasses.

1:22:10.166 --> 1:22:12.458
You that girl from live TV
who said we're all gonna die?

1:22:13.041 --> 1:22:14.958
No. What's your purchase?

1:22:18.250 --> 1:22:19.208
[scoffs]

1:22:19.291 --> 1:22:20.250
What the fuck?

1:22:20.333 --> 1:22:23.041
-Yeah, that's you. It's definitely you.
-Yep, that's me.

1:22:23.125 --> 1:22:26.833
Holy shit. You're a stone-cold legend.
Word is bond.

1:22:28.125 --> 1:22:29.583
I got a picture of you on my board.

1:22:29.666 --> 1:22:31.041
Picture on his fucking board.

1:22:31.125 --> 1:22:33.125
[Kate] That's great. What's your purchase?

1:22:33.208 --> 1:22:36.416
If you don't have one, get out of line
and make room for other customers.

1:22:36.500 --> 1:22:38.791
Can I touch your hair in a non-sexual way?

1:22:38.875 --> 1:22:41.541
-Get the fuck away from me.
-Oh, dude, have some… Um…

1:22:42.583 --> 1:22:45.041
Call Diogo, he'll freak out.
Will you say hi to my friend?

1:22:45.125 --> 1:22:47.750
Dude, he's obsessed with you.
We love you. We don't like…

1:22:47.833 --> 1:22:49.250
Can't stand Orlean, either.

1:22:49.333 --> 1:22:53.416
-Yo, yo, yo!
-[Diogo] Yo!

1:22:53.500 --> 1:22:54.583
What's up? Yo, check out…

1:22:54.666 --> 1:22:57.083
Yo, shut the fuck up.
Check out who we're with.

1:22:57.166 --> 1:22:59.833
-Yo, bro! What up?
-What up?

1:22:59.916 --> 1:23:01.166
[laughter and chatter]

1:23:01.250 --> 1:23:03.958
I mean, we have a purchase,
but we don't have payment,

1:23:04.041 --> 1:23:05.583
which is a metaphor on…

1:23:07.208 --> 1:23:09.291
-Cash?
-[man] Also, Phillip, I've been told…

1:23:09.375 --> 1:23:10.666
-Right.
-…that you wrote a book

1:23:10.750 --> 1:23:13.458
about your past relationship
with Kate Dibiasky.

1:23:13.541 --> 1:23:15.958
Funny you should say that,
I'm working on that now.

1:23:16.041 --> 1:23:18.583
It's gonna be called
A Brush With The Devil, and it's, uh…

1:23:18.666 --> 1:23:20.791
You calling security
or something, with your eyes?

1:23:20.875 --> 1:23:22.125
No. You're free to go.

1:23:22.208 --> 1:23:24.333
-[man] That sounds terrible.
-Just like that?

1:23:24.416 --> 1:23:25.541
[chuckles]

1:23:25.625 --> 1:23:27.125
You don't give a shit, do you?

1:23:28.958 --> 1:23:29.958
Sure, I do.

1:23:30.041 --> 1:23:33.041
I care about DrinkMo's guarantee
of quality service.

1:23:33.666 --> 1:23:35.500
Well, we don't give a shit either.

1:23:35.583 --> 1:23:37.208
Not one single shit.

1:23:37.291 --> 1:23:40.291
We hang and board behind the abandoned
Burger Crown from 7:00 to whenever.

1:23:40.375 --> 1:23:41.208
Yeah, we do.

1:23:41.291 --> 1:23:43.750
You should come hang.
If you're not a fucking pussy.

1:23:46.666 --> 1:23:48.333
[Phillip] Oh, you know, it's me…

1:23:48.416 --> 1:23:50.958
-Fuck. Okay. Thanks.
-…and a bottle of scotch.

1:23:51.958 --> 1:23:54.500
It's a joke. But also…

1:23:55.000 --> 1:23:58.000
[dramatic music playing]

1:24:06.541 --> 1:24:09.083
[Peter] Okay, let me introduce you

1:24:09.958 --> 1:24:16.333
uh, to mankind's savior,
BASH Explore and Acquire Drone.

1:24:16.416 --> 1:24:17.500
It's incredible.

1:24:17.583 --> 1:24:19.125
It's incredible, isn't it?

1:24:19.208 --> 1:24:22.833
I call this one Primo,
the first. [laughing]

1:24:22.916 --> 1:24:24.416
It's like my first child.

1:24:25.083 --> 1:24:31.291
Primo, my boy.
It's your father, Cronos. [laughing]

1:24:31.375 --> 1:24:35.041
Don't be shy. Come on.
You're gonna be a god in the sky.

1:24:35.125 --> 1:24:37.125
[laughter]

1:24:41.416 --> 1:24:46.583
Are you at all concerned about
the sync on the BEAD explosions?

1:24:46.666 --> 1:24:50.583
Oh, Doctor.
There are always questions and fears, and…

1:24:51.250 --> 1:24:54.500
I have a report here from a Dr. Inez.

1:24:54.583 --> 1:24:57.041
-If you'd just take a look at this study.
-Oh, thanks.

1:24:57.125 --> 1:24:59.333
Listen, a lot of my colleagues,

1:24:59.416 --> 1:25:01.875
they've either been removed
or resigned from this project,

1:25:01.958 --> 1:25:06.083
apparently for asking too many questions
about this mission here.

1:25:06.166 --> 1:25:08.750
So I just wanna make sure that you're…

1:25:09.333 --> 1:25:11.875
That you're open
to the scientific peer-review process

1:25:11.958 --> 1:25:14.583
and you're not approaching
this mission like a businessman.

1:25:14.666 --> 1:25:16.416
-You know? That--
-What did you say?

1:25:16.916 --> 1:25:20.208
-I wanna know if you're--
-Did you call me a businessman?

1:25:20.875 --> 1:25:23.916
-You do own a corporate--
-You think I'm just a businessman?

1:25:25.500 --> 1:25:27.791
Do you think you know me, Doctor?

1:25:29.375 --> 1:25:30.291
Business?

1:25:31.250 --> 1:25:35.125
This is evolution.
This is evolution of the human species.

1:25:36.125 --> 1:25:38.125
-What are you doing bringing this…
-[Orlean] Well--

1:25:38.208 --> 1:25:41.375
You know that BASH has
over 40 million data points on you,

1:25:41.458 --> 1:25:45.458
on every decision you have made
since 1994, Doctor?

1:25:45.541 --> 1:25:50.041
I… I know when you have colon polyps

1:25:50.125 --> 1:25:51.833
months before your doctor does.

1:25:51.916 --> 1:25:53.750
You got four or five
at the moment actually.

1:25:53.833 --> 1:25:57.375
You know, they're not of concern,
but I'd have a checkup as soon as you can.

1:25:57.458 --> 1:26:01.916
But much more importantly than that,
I know what you are. I know who you are.

1:26:02.000 --> 1:26:07.000
My algorithms have determined
eight fundamental consumer profile types.

1:26:07.083 --> 1:26:10.791
You are a lifestyle idealist.

1:26:10.875 --> 1:26:15.125
You think you're motivated
by beliefs, high ethical beliefs.

1:26:15.208 --> 1:26:20.125
But you just run towards pleasure
and away from pain.

1:26:22.375 --> 1:26:25.000
Like a… Like a field mouse.

1:26:27.125 --> 1:26:28.500
[Mindy] I'm just trying to…

1:26:28.583 --> 1:26:29.833
[inhales deeply]

1:26:29.916 --> 1:26:32.875
I just wanna make sure
that the science is sound on this project.

1:26:32.958 --> 1:26:34.041
I hope you understand--

1:26:34.125 --> 1:26:38.250
Our algorithms
can even predict how you'll die.

1:26:39.125 --> 1:26:44.375
To 96… 96.5% accuracy.

1:26:44.458 --> 1:26:46.333
I looked you up after we met.

1:26:47.541 --> 1:26:52.000
Your death was so unremarkable and boring.

1:26:52.666 --> 1:26:56.750
I can't remember the details,
apart from one thing.

1:26:59.000 --> 1:27:00.750
You're gonna die alone.

1:27:03.750 --> 1:27:04.791
Alone.

1:27:05.291 --> 1:27:09.958
If you'll excuse me, Madam President.
I've got some work to do.

1:27:10.041 --> 1:27:11.708
[Orlean] What the hell are you doing?

1:27:11.791 --> 1:27:14.333
-My God.
-I was trying to do my job.

1:27:14.416 --> 1:27:17.708
You are just so lucky
that Peter adores you.

1:27:23.250 --> 1:27:24.125
[sighs]

1:27:25.083 --> 1:27:27.375
You're with the grown-ups now, Randall.

1:27:27.458 --> 1:27:29.083
I can't even follow this shit anymore!

1:27:29.166 --> 1:27:31.958
-[music playing on speakers]
-[indistinct chatter]

1:27:35.166 --> 1:27:40.375
BASH got Orlean to pay
the Chilean government, if I'm correct,

1:27:40.458 --> 1:27:44.583
$90 billion to let the tsunami
hit off the coast of the country.

1:27:44.666 --> 1:27:45.666
That sound right to you?

1:27:45.750 --> 1:27:47.666
[man 3] Isherwell built
an underground bunker

1:27:47.750 --> 1:27:49.333
for him and all his executives.

1:27:49.416 --> 1:27:51.791
No, I heard that
they built an escape ship.

1:27:51.875 --> 1:27:55.250
You guys,
the truth is way more depressing.

1:27:56.291 --> 1:28:00.208
They're not even smart enough to be
as evil as you're giving them credit for.

1:28:00.833 --> 1:28:01.833

Ugh!

1:28:06.916 --> 1:28:08.541
-What?
-No.

1:28:09.500 --> 1:28:10.625

crazy, Kate. [chuckles nervously]

1:28:16.208 --> 1:28:17.833

the day that some believe
Comet Dibiasky will impact the planet.

1:28:40.250 --> 1:28:42.750
And the early word is
it's already a classic, Brie.

1:28:42.833 --> 1:28:45.500
[Brie] Oh, yes.
Well, and what a stellar cast.

1:28:45.583 --> 1:28:48.041
-Devin. Yeah.
-I love Devin Peters.

1:28:48.125 --> 1:28:49.625
He's great. Everything he does.

1:28:49.708 --> 1:28:52.708
-What's it called again?
-[Jack] It's called Total Devastation.

1:28:52.791 --> 1:28:56.208
-It cost $300 million to make.
-[Brie] Whoo!

1:28:56.291 --> 1:28:59.333
-I mean, these movies--
-[laughs] It's more than you earn.

1:28:59.416 --> 1:29:01.791
[Jack] Tell me about it.
And my friend Farley, he saw it.

1:29:01.875 --> 1:29:04.625
-He said it's a ton of fun. That's right.
-Well, Farley likes it.

1:29:04.708 --> 1:29:07.250
All right, well, what Farley says goes.

1:29:07.333 --> 1:29:08.583
But, uh, first,

1:29:09.416 --> 1:29:12.458
and yes, you can tell from my smile…

1:29:12.541 --> 1:29:13.833
[chuckles] Stop it.

1:29:13.916 --> 1:29:18.916
That America's sexiest scientist is here.
Dr. Randall. Welcome.

1:29:19.666 --> 1:29:21.375
Dr. Randall, how are you, sir?

1:29:21.458 --> 1:29:24.208
[sighs] I'm--  I'm good.
I'm gooder than good.

1:29:24.291 --> 1:29:25.583
[laughter]

1:29:25.666 --> 1:29:30.833
All right. So, Randall, we're hearing
that there is no comet,

1:29:30.916 --> 1:29:34.375
or that there is a comet but it's
a good thing or maybe it's a bad thing.

1:29:34.458 --> 1:29:36.750
We are so confused. [chuckles]

1:29:36.833 --> 1:29:41.166
So, could you please help us out here,
you know, oh, wise scientist?

1:29:42.541 --> 1:29:45.416
Well, first and foremost, Brie, um…

1:29:45.500 --> 1:29:47.833
[sniffs] …there most certainly
is a comet.

1:29:47.916 --> 1:29:48.791
[Brie] All right.

1:29:48.875 --> 1:29:52.125
And we know that there is a comet
because we have the data.

1:29:53.125 --> 1:29:54.416
Um… [clears throat]

1:29:54.500 --> 1:29:58.666
There has been growing concern within
the scientific community as of late.

1:29:59.333 --> 1:30:02.875
You see, the peer-review process
is absolutely essential…

1:30:02.958 --> 1:30:05.583
-If BASH's stock…
-…for us to get to the facts of… Yes?

1:30:05.666 --> 1:30:07.333
If BASH's stock is any indicator,

1:30:07.416 --> 1:30:09.333
we don't have to worry
about the peer review.

1:30:09.416 --> 1:30:10.583
It is going gangbusters.

1:30:10.666 --> 1:30:13.125
And full disclosure.
I bought as many shares as I could.

1:30:13.208 --> 1:30:14.500
I advise you to do the same.

1:30:14.583 --> 1:30:16.333
You are such a shameless capitalist.

1:30:16.416 --> 1:30:19.458
Said the woman who will be
in the brand-new hot tub on my back deck

1:30:19.541 --> 1:30:22.083
-when I put it in from the stock.
-You know me too well.

1:30:41.833 --> 1:30:44.791
I'm sorry, but not everything
needs to sound so goddamn clever

1:30:47.166 --> 1:30:50.583

1:30:57.791 --> 1:31:01.916
that there is a huge comet
headed towards Earth.

1:31:02.666 --> 1:31:05.291
And the reason we know
that there is a comet

1:31:05.375 --> 1:31:06.833
is because we saw it.

1:31:06.916 --> 1:31:10.208
We saw it with our own eyes
using a telescope.

1:31:10.291 --> 1:31:13.500
I mean, for God's sake,
we took a fucking picture of it!

1:31:13.583 --> 1:31:15.291
What other proof do we need?

1:31:15.791 --> 1:31:18.375
And if we can't all agree
at the bare minimum

1:31:18.458 --> 1:31:22.875
that a giant comet
the size of Mount Everest

1:31:22.958 --> 1:31:29.041
hurtling its way towards planet Earth
is not a fucking good thing,

1:31:29.833 --> 1:31:32.125
then what the hell happened to us?

1:31:33.000 --> 1:31:37.333
I mean, my God, how do--
How do we even talk to each other?

1:31:37.416 --> 1:31:41.208
What've we… What've we done to ourselves?
How do we fix it?

1:31:41.291 --> 1:31:44.791
We should have deflected this comet
when we had the fucking chance,

1:31:44.875 --> 1:31:48.083
but we didn't do it.
I don't know why we didn't do it.

1:31:48.166 --> 1:31:51.958
And now they're
actually firing scientists like me

1:31:52.041 --> 1:31:54.666
for speaking out, for opposing them.

1:31:55.416 --> 1:31:57.875
And I'm sure many of the people out there

1:31:57.958 --> 1:31:59.958
aren't even
gonna listen to what I just said

1:32:00.041 --> 1:32:02.833

their own political ideology,
