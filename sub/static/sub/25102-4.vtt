WEBVTT

00:00.134 --> 00:02.000
Let's talk about
that business opportunity.

00:02.001 --> 00:04.269
Some Vietnamese got a place
over on Front Street

00:04.271 --> 00:05.270
in National City.

00:05.272 --> 00:06.605
Pill mill.

00:06.607 --> 00:08.206
If we don't pull a job soon,
we're gonna run out of money.

00:08.208 --> 00:09.808
I got something
we can do right now.

00:09.810 --> 00:11.476
This place pulls in
over 100 grand a week.

00:11.478 --> 00:13.946
Security bars on the windows
and the door.

00:13.948 --> 00:15.079
The bank.

00:15.081 --> 00:16.681
Two guys inside,
both with handguns.

00:16.683 --> 00:17.950
We can't go in
through the front.

00:17.952 --> 00:19.351
They're just gonna
lock themselves in the back

00:19.353 --> 00:20.485
before we can even
get to them.

00:20.487 --> 00:21.353
Yep.

00:21.355 --> 00:22.755
You're Clark Lincoln.

00:22.757 --> 00:25.423
You signed my KTM hat
at the X Games in L.A.,

00:25.425 --> 00:26.625
like, 10 years ago, man.

00:26.627 --> 00:28.026
I wore that thing
till it fell apart.

00:28.028 --> 00:28.893
You pulled a job?

00:28.895 --> 00:29.762
Who did you use?

00:29.764 --> 00:31.163
Ox and Colby.

00:33.233 --> 00:34.499
She took...
She took my coke, okay?

00:35.435 --> 00:37.369
Jesus Christ.

00:37.371 --> 00:38.637
Hey, I'm Nicky.

00:38.639 --> 00:39.738
I know.

00:40.507 --> 00:42.440
Nicky, stop.

00:42.442 --> 00:43.575
Wait, w-what's going on?

00:43.577 --> 00:46.178
I'm... I'm really sorry
about earlier, okay?

00:46.180 --> 00:47.445
I need a place to crash.

00:47.447 --> 00:50.715
I'll have to ask Smurf.

00:50.717 --> 00:51.984
Smurf's in jail.

00:53.453 --> 00:54.586
I'll take the couch.

00:56.000 --> 01:02.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:19.133 --> 03:20.933
My client
has been here for weeks

03:20.935 --> 03:22.534
and the evidentiary hearing
keeps getting pushed.

03:22.536 --> 03:24.469
Come on, Jackie.

03:24.471 --> 03:26.605
We requested extra time
to research applicable law.

03:26.607 --> 03:28.473
Bullshit.
She can't do that.

03:28.475 --> 03:29.608
They can.

03:29.610 --> 03:31.009
They can,
but not forever.

03:31.011 --> 03:32.010
Now, let's, uh...

03:32.012 --> 03:34.212
let's talk about
my 995 motion.

03:34.214 --> 03:35.347
Your 995...

03:35.349 --> 03:37.149
The stuff about probable cause
isn't enough...

03:37.151 --> 03:39.818
Why haven't we been given
the ballistics report yet?

03:39.820 --> 03:42.020
You will.
There's a process.

03:42.022 --> 03:43.756
Listen, you wanna
go to the mattresses

03:43.758 --> 03:45.223
over
a reasonable basis test...

03:45.225 --> 03:47.826
I think you haven't released
the ballistics report

03:47.828 --> 03:49.894
because you don't like
what it says.

03:49.896 --> 03:51.163
As you can see,

03:51.165 --> 03:53.365
my client
is understandably passionate

03:53.367 --> 03:54.699
about her defense.

03:54.701 --> 03:56.100
Now, getting back
to p.c...

03:56.102 --> 03:57.502
Have you looked
for other suspects?

03:57.504 --> 04:00.038
We're comfortable with
our theory of the crime.

04:00.040 --> 04:02.975
Then why do you have
a state detective present

04:02.977 --> 04:05.377
at my legal conference?

04:05.379 --> 04:07.112
What's the matter there,
Pearce?

04:07.114 --> 04:08.981
You run out of illegals
to round up

04:08.983 --> 04:10.114
down at the 7-Eleven?

04:10.116 --> 04:11.450
This isn't helping.

04:11.452 --> 04:15.253
I'm asking the questions
that you should be asking.

04:20.861 --> 04:22.327
Let's make this simple,
Jackie.

04:22.329 --> 04:25.798
Evidentiary hearing
and discovery this week,

04:25.800 --> 04:27.399
or release my client.

04:29.536 --> 04:30.669
Goodbye.

04:38.012 --> 04:40.879
Oh, my God.
Bacon is ridiculous.

04:44.084 --> 04:45.750
Still there?
Mm.

04:45.752 --> 04:47.152
Third day in a row.

04:47.154 --> 04:48.821
Is that why we're, uh,

04:48.823 --> 04:51.023
buying groceries
we don't need?

04:51.025 --> 04:52.557
Something like that.

04:54.361 --> 04:56.228
So what's the job?

04:59.700 --> 05:01.299
Come on, J.

05:01.301 --> 05:02.967
It's better if you don't know
in case the cops show up.

05:02.969 --> 05:04.703
No. I can contribute.

05:04.705 --> 05:06.505
There will be something
for you.

05:10.777 --> 05:13.245
So, what's the deal
with, uh, Mia?

05:14.648 --> 05:16.114
What?

05:16.116 --> 05:19.384
The girl that, uh,
cold-cocked a drug dealer.

05:19.386 --> 05:21.386
The girl you let
sleep on our couch.

05:21.388 --> 05:23.321
She's a friend of Smurf's.
Oh, really?

05:23.323 --> 05:25.724
Smurf and an 18-year-old <i> chola</i>
are friends?

05:25.726 --> 05:26.925
Look,
she's who I have to pay

05:26.927 --> 05:29.061
to protect Smurf
in prison, okay?

05:29.063 --> 05:30.462
But you can't tell
the others that.

05:30.464 --> 05:33.198
If they find out that that's
where the money's going...

05:33.200 --> 05:34.733
We just don't need
the drama.

05:36.136 --> 05:37.736
You know,
they're all gonna think

05:37.738 --> 05:40.472
that you're doing her.

05:54.088 --> 05:56.121
You should let me
do my job.

05:59.826 --> 06:02.361
They don't have
a damn thing on me.

06:02.363 --> 06:03.896
You sure?

06:03.898 --> 06:06.965
The bullet
that killed Javi Cano

06:06.967 --> 06:10.168
did not come
from my gun.

06:10.170 --> 06:11.704
I'm going to assume

06:11.706 --> 06:12.837
you're speaking
hypothetically

06:12.839 --> 06:14.172
because, absent evidence,

06:14.174 --> 06:16.575
the only way someone
would be certain of that

06:16.577 --> 06:17.776
is if they were present

06:17.778 --> 06:20.112
at the time
Mr. Cano got shot.

06:20.114 --> 06:21.914
And I'm certain you are
not gonna tell me that.

06:21.916 --> 06:23.582
What is your plan?

06:23.584 --> 06:27.051
Accusing them of withholding
exculpatory information

06:27.053 --> 06:28.387
is serious,

06:28.389 --> 06:30.522
especially when you do it
to the D.A.'s face.

06:30.524 --> 06:32.257
Am I wrong?
That isn't the point.

06:32.259 --> 06:34.593
No, it is <i> exactly</i>
the point!

06:34.595 --> 06:35.860
All right, listen.

06:35.862 --> 06:39.331
Let's say, hypothetically,

06:39.333 --> 06:41.734
they <i> are</i> trying
to find something else

06:41.736 --> 06:42.935
to charge you with.

06:42.937 --> 06:44.903
Will they?

06:46.340 --> 06:47.740
No.

06:47.742 --> 06:50.475
Great.

06:50.477 --> 06:52.544
Then you have nothing
to worry about.

07:01.956 --> 07:05.557
I can't keep the delay tactics
going forever.

07:05.559 --> 07:07.159
I have surveillance
on her boys now.

07:07.161 --> 07:08.627
I need more time.

07:08.629 --> 07:10.028
Yeah, we'd all love
a little more time.

07:10.030 --> 07:11.496
Unfortunately,
there's this thing

07:11.498 --> 07:12.897
called the Constitution.

07:12.899 --> 07:14.699
You can't keep people
in prison indefinitely

07:14.701 --> 07:17.702
until you find something else
to charge them with.

07:17.704 --> 07:20.104
One of the bullets
in Javi Cano's head

07:20.106 --> 07:21.239
was from Smurf's gun.

07:21.241 --> 07:22.975
You mean
the one that entered

07:22.977 --> 07:24.643
<i>after</i>
he was already dead?

07:24.645 --> 07:27.112
I've got a dozen other cases
in front of this judge.

07:27.114 --> 07:30.482
I am not blowing my credibility
with him over this.

07:39.860 --> 07:42.127
Mm. No cilantro.

07:44.130 --> 07:45.264
Oh, and O.J.

07:47.668 --> 07:50.268
You know, some guy
came into the bar the other day

07:50.270 --> 07:52.871
asking for a screwdriver
with turmeric in it.

07:52.873 --> 07:53.938
Turmeric?

07:53.940 --> 07:56.075
Wow.

07:58.745 --> 08:00.545
Family breakfast.

08:00.547 --> 08:02.481
What's the occasion?

08:19.633 --> 08:22.234
Who's that?

08:22.236 --> 08:24.269
Just a friend.

08:28.709 --> 08:29.608
TapatÃ­o.

08:34.448 --> 08:36.181
You got someone
staying here?

08:36.183 --> 08:37.850
People don't stay here.

08:37.852 --> 08:39.317
I have people stay here.

08:39.318 --> 08:41.453
Girls you bang.

08:50.397 --> 08:53.198
Was that police tail
still on you this morning?

08:53.200 --> 08:55.067
Third day in a row.
No one else has a tail?

08:55.069 --> 08:57.402
Unh-unh.
You sure?

08:57.404 --> 08:59.538
Yo, if J can spot a tail,
I sure as hell can.

08:59.540 --> 09:00.338
Okay. Good.

09:00.340 --> 09:03.342
So there's one tail.

09:08.148 --> 09:10.616
Let's take it
to the garage.

09:29.503 --> 09:32.304
Okay, so, the truck's
gonna be there, right?

09:32.306 --> 09:33.972
The truck will be there.

09:33.974 --> 09:35.039
Car's insured?

09:35.041 --> 09:36.241
Yes,
the car is insured.

09:36.243 --> 09:37.476
Because I'm not
an idiot.

09:38.512 --> 09:39.844
What?

09:39.846 --> 09:41.446
Someone asks if I've done
a basic, obvious task,

09:41.448 --> 09:42.581
it implies
I'm being an idiot.

09:42.583 --> 09:43.848
Well,
you're not being an idiot,

09:43.850 --> 09:44.983
but you are being
a little bitch.

09:44.985 --> 09:46.118
Why, because
I'm the only one

09:46.120 --> 09:47.185
that thinks this job
is bullshit?

09:47.187 --> 09:50.055
Oh, here we go.

09:50.057 --> 09:51.323
A security guard outside,

09:51.325 --> 09:52.324
J's got a tail
literally waiting for us

09:52.326 --> 09:53.525
to come out right now.

09:53.527 --> 09:54.993
I'm just saying,
those sound like

09:54.995 --> 09:56.060
significant risk factors
to me.

09:56.062 --> 09:56.995
I know.

09:56.997 --> 09:59.197
It's covered.
Yeah?

09:59.199 --> 10:00.933
Okay.

10:00.935 --> 10:02.368
It's covered.

10:06.073 --> 10:08.073
It'll be fine.

10:08.075 --> 10:10.342
Yeah.

10:15.816 --> 10:18.150
You know...

10:18.152 --> 10:20.685
the night before a job,

10:20.687 --> 10:22.487
you invite someone
into the house?

10:22.489 --> 10:24.222
It was
a last-minute thing.

10:24.224 --> 10:26.959
Yeah, it was.

10:26.961 --> 10:29.027
It was.

10:31.431 --> 10:33.165
You know
what you're doing?

10:34.568 --> 10:36.901
The steel door...
which way does it swing?

10:36.903 --> 10:38.103
Toward the back.

10:38.105 --> 10:39.171
You are 100 percent
about that?

10:39.173 --> 10:40.639
Because Deran is right...

10:40.641 --> 10:42.441
the second the guys hear
something on the inside,

10:42.443 --> 10:44.410
they're gonna make a move.

10:46.913 --> 10:49.914
I vouched for you on this.

10:49.916 --> 10:52.450
I saw a panic bar.

10:52.452 --> 10:53.585
You know, the thing
in the middle of the door...

10:53.587 --> 10:55.788
I know
what a panic bar is.

10:55.790 --> 10:57.122
Well, I saw one, okay?

10:57.124 --> 10:58.791
The door swings
toward the back.

10:58.793 --> 11:01.059
And how far from the back wall
is this door?

11:01.061 --> 11:02.260
18 to 20 feet.

11:08.068 --> 11:09.601
I got this.

11:12.739 --> 11:14.139
Okay.

11:15.942 --> 11:17.342
Okay.

11:59.653 --> 12:01.786
Yo, bitchin' ride.

12:01.788 --> 12:03.255
Could've gotten
a Porsche.

12:03.257 --> 12:04.923
You wanna pay
25 percent of that?

12:04.925 --> 12:06.525
How'd you get this thing past emissions?
I know a guy.

12:06.527 --> 12:08.126
What, a guy with
a broken smog checker?

12:08.128 --> 12:10.062
It starts and it goes.

12:10.064 --> 12:11.596
It's perfect.

12:39.760 --> 12:41.760
We got him?

12:41.762 --> 12:43.228
We got him.

12:51.906 --> 12:53.238
Grey sedan.

12:53.240 --> 12:54.839
Yep.

12:54.841 --> 12:56.975
It pisses me off.

12:56.977 --> 12:58.977
The tail.

12:58.979 --> 13:01.246
He's supposed to be
a professional.

13:01.248 --> 13:04.049
See without being seen.

13:05.920 --> 13:08.253
It's just, you know...

13:08.255 --> 13:10.122
learn your craft.

13:14.661 --> 13:17.329
That girl
you have at the house...

13:17.331 --> 13:18.931
Mia? What about her?
Yeah.

13:18.933 --> 13:21.333
Yeah, I know you didn't go
to high school with her.

13:21.335 --> 13:23.001
She's got juvie
written all over her.

13:23.003 --> 13:24.269
What's her deal?

13:24.271 --> 13:28.673
I, uh... I hooked up
with her at a party.

13:28.675 --> 13:30.275
But you can't tell Nicky,
okay?

13:30.277 --> 13:32.277
I told her
I'm just helping a friend out.

13:32.279 --> 13:33.345
Okay, you know what?

13:33.347 --> 13:35.013
What we do
is hard enough...

13:35.015 --> 13:37.349
without
relationship problems.

13:37.351 --> 13:40.752
Shit'll ruin your life.

13:40.754 --> 13:42.687
I'm handling it.

13:42.689 --> 13:44.289
But thanks.

14:14.455 --> 14:16.188
We're in position.

14:16.190 --> 14:17.656
<i>You awake over there?</i>

14:17.658 --> 14:20.325
Yeah, I see you.

14:20.327 --> 14:21.593
<i>Okay, good.</i>

14:21.595 --> 14:22.995
<i>All right, we're
waiting on the signal.</i>

15:05.439 --> 15:06.971
The back room
is clear.

15:10.110 --> 15:12.511
High-angle pics
are bullshit.

15:12.513 --> 15:13.846
Hey, check this out.

15:13.848 --> 15:15.047
Check it out!

15:17.051 --> 15:18.650
<i>Ready for J.</i>

15:18.652 --> 15:20.652
Go.

15:29.329 --> 15:30.663
<i>911,
what's your emergency?</i>

15:30.665 --> 15:32.397
Hi, I just saw somebody
walk into a bank

15:32.399 --> 15:33.398
with his hoodie up.

15:33.400 --> 15:34.599
I think he has a gun.

15:49.149 --> 15:50.682
We've got two minutes.

16:17.511 --> 16:20.044
Oh, my God. I'm so sorry.

16:20.046 --> 16:22.981
Are you okay, sir?
I'm so sorry.

16:22.983 --> 16:24.649
I don't...
what happened, man?

16:24.651 --> 16:26.919
- Hang on...
- Are you hurt at all?

16:26.921 --> 16:28.520
I'm okay. I'm okay.

16:28.522 --> 16:30.188
Hey, excuse me?
Can you help us out, please?

16:30.190 --> 16:31.790
Oh, my God.
Look at my car!

16:33.127 --> 16:34.058
What was that?

16:34.060 --> 16:34.927
<i>Do it.</i>

16:38.532 --> 16:39.531
What the hell
are you doing?!

16:42.336 --> 16:44.469
Hey, get back, man.

16:48.742 --> 16:50.475
Shit!

16:53.147 --> 16:54.679
No, no, no! Don't, man!

16:54.681 --> 16:55.480
Aah!

16:55.482 --> 16:56.681
Goddamn it!

16:56.683 --> 16:58.016
You Goddamn moron!

17:01.488 --> 17:03.488
We're being hit!
We're being hit!

17:16.569 --> 17:18.569
- You're not hurt, at all?
- I-I...

17:18.571 --> 17:20.505
- Do you want my name or...?
- Stay there.

17:22.909 --> 17:24.977
Get down. Get down.

17:28.783 --> 17:30.448
I'm in.

17:59.079 --> 18:00.212
Got it.

18:05.019 --> 18:06.150
On me. Let's go.

18:06.152 --> 18:07.219
Gun! Gun!

18:07.221 --> 18:08.420
- I'm a cop!
- Don't move!

18:08.422 --> 18:10.088
- I'm a cop.
- Gun on the ground.

18:10.090 --> 18:10.955
Nice and easy.

18:12.359 --> 18:13.425
I'm a cop.

18:18.165 --> 18:20.365
Bro, mollies.
No.

18:20.367 --> 18:22.634
Come on.
It's easy money. No!

18:22.636 --> 18:24.703
Grab the camera hard drive
off the shelf.

18:29.976 --> 18:32.845
- What happened?
- I-I was just driving away

18:32.847 --> 18:34.046
and then, out of nowhere...
You know what?

18:34.048 --> 18:35.180
He knows what happened.
He's the witness.

18:35.182 --> 18:36.248
He saw it.
Sir?

18:36.250 --> 18:37.315
I need to talk
to you.

18:37.317 --> 18:39.784
I can't. I...
Get over here.

18:39.786 --> 18:41.186
It's okay.
We'll figure this out.

18:41.188 --> 18:43.455
Hey! Nobody leaves.

18:43.457 --> 18:44.589
I got to talk
to this guy.

18:44.591 --> 18:46.191
Whoa, whoa, whoa. What's...

18:46.193 --> 18:47.325
What's going on, man?

18:47.327 --> 18:49.194
I leave you for, like,
five minutes.

18:49.196 --> 18:50.462
What the hell?

18:50.464 --> 18:51.664
It just happened.
I don't know what...

18:51.666 --> 18:53.932
Well, it's my car.
I-I was just driving...

18:57.204 --> 18:58.437
Let's go!

19:00.875 --> 19:01.840
Lift!

19:05.212 --> 19:07.612
Good! Go, go, go!

20:08.109 --> 20:09.374
Hey.

20:10.577 --> 20:12.577
You lookin' for me?
Um, no.

20:12.579 --> 20:14.113
I was just, uh...

20:14.115 --> 20:16.648
If there's something
you want to ask me,

20:16.650 --> 20:18.417
just ask, okay?

20:20.988 --> 20:22.988
Listen, I'm getting off here
in a few minutes.

20:22.990 --> 20:25.157
Just wait here.

20:39.140 --> 20:41.472
- Where are they?
- Probably home eating dinner.

20:41.474 --> 20:42.741
False alarm.
Nothing was stolen.

20:42.743 --> 20:44.009
Nobody tried
to steal anything.

20:44.011 --> 20:45.210
Last I checked,

20:45.212 --> 20:47.746
calling in a false alarm
was a felony.

20:49.883 --> 20:51.482
The phone
that called it in?

20:51.484 --> 20:52.551
Burner.

20:52.553 --> 20:54.619
The car accident?

20:54.621 --> 20:56.021
They exchanged
insurance info.

20:56.023 --> 20:57.288
And they filed...
Got a police report

20:57.290 --> 21:00.492
to submit
to the insurance company.

21:00.494 --> 21:01.960
Yep.

21:02.629 --> 21:04.963
So the Cody family's
40 miles from home,

21:04.965 --> 21:07.432
all this crap happens...

21:07.434 --> 21:08.834
and for no reason.

21:14.241 --> 21:18.309
Does it seem odd to you that
a nutritional supplement store

21:18.311 --> 21:21.814
has got security doors
and barred windows?

21:23.650 --> 21:25.184
Let's take a walk.

21:32.726 --> 21:34.026
Hello.

21:40.534 --> 21:41.666
Bee pollen.

21:41.668 --> 21:43.068
I hear it's a superfood.

22:12.099 --> 22:13.498
Thank you for your time,
ma'am.

22:18.171 --> 22:19.571
It's a pill mill.

22:21.041 --> 22:22.908
The Codys ripped it off,
and we helped them do it.

22:26.113 --> 22:27.913
Nice play, boys.

22:27.915 --> 22:29.848
Nice play.

22:52.205 --> 22:53.672
Does she have
much homework?

22:55.809 --> 22:57.142
Yeah.

22:59.346 --> 23:01.012
Yeah, yeah, I heard her.
It's fine.

23:01.014 --> 23:02.681
I'll, uh...

23:02.683 --> 23:05.050
I'll pick her up
first thing in the morning.

23:15.496 --> 23:17.562
How's Lena?

23:17.564 --> 23:20.231
Watching TV.

23:20.233 --> 23:21.900
Hundred grand. Easy.

23:21.902 --> 23:23.302
Hell, yeah!

23:24.438 --> 23:25.838
Say it.

23:27.975 --> 23:29.975
Say it.

23:29.977 --> 23:31.376
Go on. Say it!

23:31.378 --> 23:32.978
He doesn't
have to say it.

23:32.980 --> 23:35.780
Come on. Say it.

23:35.782 --> 23:37.983
Good job, J.

23:37.985 --> 23:39.718
Thanks.

23:39.720 --> 23:41.386
And we didn't have to catch a
bunch of shit the whole time

23:41.388 --> 23:42.988
like we did with Baz.

23:48.862 --> 23:49.995
Three grand?

23:49.997 --> 23:52.597
If it's $100,000,
it should be...

23:52.599 --> 23:53.999
It's $98,000.

23:54.001 --> 23:56.201
Fine. Minus our cuts,
that's $86,000.

23:56.203 --> 23:58.737
You need $86,000
to pay some bills?

23:58.739 --> 24:00.605
Yeah.

24:00.607 --> 24:02.941
And that'll only last us
a couple of weeks.

24:02.943 --> 24:05.476
How much
is Smurf getting paid?

24:05.478 --> 24:06.478
Zero.

24:06.480 --> 24:09.948
Look, we've all got
bills to pay.

24:09.950 --> 24:15.887
Okay, well,
I have employees to pay.

24:15.889 --> 24:17.422
There's an extra $1,500.

24:17.424 --> 24:18.924
Split it between
the three of you.

24:21.695 --> 24:23.128
Let's go.

24:34.908 --> 24:36.241
After how we met,

24:36.243 --> 24:38.643
I was surprised to see
you had a regular job.

24:38.645 --> 24:39.845
What did you think?

24:39.847 --> 24:41.112
I don't know.

24:41.114 --> 24:44.649
Like... gun runner
or fighter pilot

24:44.651 --> 24:46.785
or who knows what.

24:46.787 --> 24:48.453
Turns out it's mufflers.

24:50.657 --> 24:53.324
Who's Little Pete?

24:53.326 --> 24:56.061
Big Pete's son.

24:56.063 --> 24:58.063
No, he's my cousin.

24:58.065 --> 24:59.464
I've been there
a couple of years.

24:59.466 --> 25:01.666
But I've been working
since I was little.

25:01.668 --> 25:03.068
Had to.

25:03.070 --> 25:05.604
So, uh, yeah.

25:05.606 --> 25:07.272
Not a gun runner.

25:07.274 --> 25:09.741
And collecting
Smurf's protection money.

25:09.743 --> 25:12.211
That's why J lets you
stay at the house, right?

25:14.147 --> 25:16.215
I take on extra work
sometimes.

25:16.217 --> 25:18.683
And you get that work
from your cousin.

25:18.685 --> 25:20.486
Sometimes.

25:22.289 --> 25:23.689
Are you, like,
in a gang?

25:27.027 --> 25:28.827
Are the Codys a gang?

25:28.829 --> 25:31.897
We're a family.

25:31.899 --> 25:34.099
Hmm.

25:34.101 --> 25:35.434
And you're a part
of that family?

25:35.436 --> 25:37.302
Well, J and I have been together
for two years.

25:41.909 --> 25:43.242
How'd you meet?

25:43.244 --> 25:45.376
I was trying
to buy a beer,

25:45.378 --> 25:47.646
and I had
this really crappy fake ID,

25:47.648 --> 25:50.315
and the guy
wouldn't sell it to me.

25:50.317 --> 25:51.516
So J comes in,

25:51.518 --> 25:53.118
he puts $5 on the counter,
and says,

25:53.120 --> 25:54.185
"We're taking the beer."

25:54.187 --> 25:55.787
Bad boy.

25:55.789 --> 25:57.388
Yeah.

25:57.390 --> 25:59.524
I had never seen him
outside of algebra.

25:59.526 --> 26:02.127
Hell, I had never ever
heard him talk before.

26:02.129 --> 26:03.929
But we go
behind the liquor store

26:03.931 --> 26:07.799
and drink beer
and make out.

26:07.801 --> 26:09.401
It was awesome.

26:09.403 --> 26:10.802
Hm.

26:10.804 --> 26:12.003
And what?

26:12.005 --> 26:14.740
Y'all been thick as thieves
ever since, huh?

26:14.742 --> 26:18.677
Well, J and I have
been through a lot.

26:18.679 --> 26:20.679
I was there
when his mom died.

26:35.162 --> 26:37.529
Who the hell is this?

26:52.980 --> 26:54.379
What the hell are
you doing out here, man?

26:54.381 --> 26:55.714
Hey, hey. Deran.

26:55.716 --> 26:57.116
Jesus Christ. Hey.

26:57.118 --> 26:58.117
Put your hands up!
Get out!

26:58.119 --> 26:59.651
Jesus.

26:59.653 --> 27:00.786
Shit.

27:03.256 --> 27:04.255
Deran...?

27:05.726 --> 27:06.792
Do I know you?

27:08.729 --> 27:10.329
Yeah. It's Billy.

27:17.538 --> 27:18.804
Shit.

27:20.007 --> 27:21.206
It's your father.

27:31.618 --> 27:33.952
They really wanted me
to go with them,

27:33.954 --> 27:35.754
but it was like,
"Seriously, Dad? Guam?"

27:35.756 --> 27:38.289
It's like an airstrip
and two hotels.

27:40.894 --> 27:42.494
Where the hell is Guam?

27:42.496 --> 27:43.495
Somewhere in the ocean.

27:44.898 --> 27:46.231
Do you need to get that?

27:46.233 --> 27:47.098
No.

27:49.302 --> 27:50.235
Anyway...

27:50.237 --> 27:52.103
Anyway, I have too much
going on here, so...

27:52.105 --> 27:54.906
Yeah?
Mm-hmm.

28:00.781 --> 28:02.247
Girl, do I look like
a snitch to you?

28:05.853 --> 28:07.519
Y'all are robbing banks.

28:07.521 --> 28:08.387
Oh, please.

28:08.389 --> 28:10.321
You know
the average bank robber

28:10.323 --> 28:11.523
gets, like, 5 grand?

28:11.525 --> 28:15.927
We don't even get out of bed
for less than 100k.

28:19.600 --> 28:20.866
A yacht?
Mm-hmm.

28:28.542 --> 28:30.475
I think that Marine
digs you.

28:30.477 --> 28:32.077
Oo-rah.

28:32.079 --> 28:33.412
Marines are cool.

28:33.414 --> 28:35.814
Reliable, patriotic.

28:35.816 --> 28:37.416
You should
go talk to him.

28:37.418 --> 28:38.750
I have a boyfriend.

28:42.089 --> 28:43.889
You ever see
"The Little Mermaid"?

28:43.891 --> 28:45.624
The kids' movie?

28:45.626 --> 28:46.758
Yeah,
like a million years ago.

28:46.760 --> 28:48.026
When I was growing up,

28:48.028 --> 28:49.561
it was the only DVD
the group home had.

28:49.563 --> 28:51.697
And I watched it
over and over again.

28:53.767 --> 28:55.166
It never made
any sense to me.

28:55.168 --> 28:57.903
She gave it all up
to grow legs,

28:57.905 --> 28:59.704
be with a dude.

29:06.313 --> 29:08.179
Are you saying
I'm a fish?

29:09.983 --> 29:10.982
I'm saying you're trying
to live in a world

29:10.984 --> 29:12.183
you're not from.

29:19.260 --> 29:20.592
What's the deal
with you and J?

29:27.400 --> 29:28.199
Hey.

29:28.201 --> 29:29.468
How's it going?

29:33.006 --> 29:34.139
How are ya?

29:34.141 --> 29:35.607
I'm doing much better now.
Thank you.

30:06.974 --> 30:08.373
Yeah, so Frankie and I

30:08.375 --> 30:09.841
have been just driving
up and down the coast.

30:09.843 --> 30:12.577
Doing what?

30:15.248 --> 30:18.049
Uh, I wouldn't even know
where to start, man.

30:18.051 --> 30:20.719
You know,
I heard Smurf got busted.

30:20.721 --> 30:21.920
And, uh, I just thought

30:21.922 --> 30:23.522
it might be a great time
to catch up.

30:23.524 --> 30:26.858
'Cause, you know, she never
really wanted me around.

30:26.860 --> 30:29.661
And I hate to speak ill
of the incarcerated,

30:29.663 --> 30:33.598
but Smurf could be
a real ball buster.

30:37.938 --> 30:39.938
All right, I gotta go.

30:57.024 --> 30:59.558
Hey, man, you okay?

30:59.560 --> 31:00.692
Yeah.

31:00.694 --> 31:02.027
It's no big deal.
You're my father.

31:02.029 --> 31:03.895
As opposed to
the hundreds of other guys

31:03.897 --> 31:05.264
that banged Smurf.

31:06.033 --> 31:07.432
Right.

31:07.434 --> 31:10.035
I just thought maybe,
you know,

31:10.037 --> 31:11.770
you might need a kidney
one day.

31:20.581 --> 31:22.113
All right. See ya later.

31:29.190 --> 31:31.590
Oh, I wanted to win
that jacket.

31:31.592 --> 31:33.124
I bet it was super hot.

31:33.126 --> 31:35.326
It had fringe.

31:35.328 --> 31:37.396
I sold 149 boxes.

31:37.398 --> 31:39.464
No one was even close
to me.

31:39.466 --> 31:41.933
But the night before
we handed in our tallies,

31:41.935 --> 31:45.737
Kaylee DelNero's dad
bought 150 boxes from her.

31:45.739 --> 31:47.005
He was a lawyer.

31:47.007 --> 31:48.673
Oh. Douche.

31:48.675 --> 31:51.010
Well, I found out the morning
of the check-in. Mm-hmm.

31:51.012 --> 31:53.212
So, I go up to him
all sad...

31:53.214 --> 31:54.813
"No one bought
any cookies from me."

31:54.815 --> 31:56.481
Damn, Pete.
And he buys two boxes right there.

31:56.483 --> 31:58.016
You can't just
leave a voicemail?

31:58.018 --> 31:59.484
Boom. 151.
Yeah.

31:59.486 --> 32:01.352
Because
I was with somebody.

32:01.354 --> 32:03.622
You made a point
of selling two boxes

32:03.624 --> 32:05.557
to the father of the girl who
was going to beat you? Listen...

32:05.559 --> 32:07.025
Eat it, Kaylee DelNero.
I heard some interesting Cody stuff.

32:07.027 --> 32:08.693
You don't step
to this Brownie.

32:10.497 --> 32:12.698
Nicky,
you're really funny.

32:12.700 --> 32:14.833
Ha, yeah.

32:14.835 --> 32:16.167
No, seriously.
You're funny.

32:16.169 --> 32:19.171
You're really...
interesting.

32:20.173 --> 32:22.574
Oh... thank you.

32:33.386 --> 32:34.653
They seem harmless.

32:34.655 --> 32:36.322
They're not.

32:40.661 --> 32:43.328
What do you remember
about him?

32:43.330 --> 32:44.529
I remember him laughing

32:44.531 --> 32:47.198
while he took a piss
in the kitchen sink.

32:47.200 --> 32:49.067
I remember
he's an asshole.

32:49.069 --> 32:51.670
And I remember
Smurf kicking him out.

32:54.675 --> 32:56.608
Get rid of them.

35:08.876 --> 35:11.477
You stealing from me?

35:13.346 --> 35:16.748
If you're looking for my purse,
I hide it now.

35:16.750 --> 35:18.617
What you stealing? Huh?

35:18.619 --> 35:20.752
Nothing.

35:24.025 --> 35:26.958
Why did you come through
the back door then?

35:31.899 --> 35:35.100
When are you going to
visit him?

35:37.037 --> 35:38.770
I'm not.

35:40.841 --> 35:43.374
You know
he is gonna get out.

35:44.912 --> 35:48.780
What do I tell him
when he calls?

35:48.782 --> 35:50.782
Tell him I'm dead.

36:05.733 --> 36:07.466
Hey. How's it been?

36:07.468 --> 36:09.067
Slow.

36:09.069 --> 36:11.336
But some guy's
been waiting for you.

36:11.338 --> 36:13.071
I didn't know
if you were coming in,

36:13.073 --> 36:16.275
so... he's been here
for kind of a while.

36:17.744 --> 36:18.877
Okay.

36:25.152 --> 36:26.985
What are you doing here?

36:28.355 --> 36:29.754
I need work.

36:29.756 --> 36:30.689
You said there'd be work.

36:30.691 --> 36:33.492
Ipso facto...
"Ipso facto."

36:33.494 --> 36:34.493
Okay, you know what?

36:34.495 --> 36:35.827
I got nothin' for us
right now.

36:35.829 --> 36:38.097
I'm looking into some stuff,
but I got nothin'.

36:38.099 --> 36:40.565
I'm pretty tight here.

36:40.567 --> 36:42.501
What do I look like to you,
a goddamn welfare office?

36:42.503 --> 36:44.703
You look like the guy
who promised there'd be work.

36:46.307 --> 36:47.706
I'll have something for us.

36:47.708 --> 36:49.708
I just need some time.

36:52.313 --> 36:54.346
I assume
that's on the house then.

36:55.716 --> 36:57.116
We'll talk soon.

37:09.997 --> 37:12.197
Seven and seven.

37:15.736 --> 37:16.868
Uh, Clark Lincoln.

37:16.870 --> 37:18.603
- Linc.
- Yeah?

37:18.605 --> 37:19.938
You and your brother came to the E.R...
Oh, yeah, all right.

37:19.940 --> 37:22.007
I know who you are.

37:22.009 --> 37:23.074
What are you doing here?

37:24.878 --> 37:27.146
Uh, a signed KTM hat.

37:27.148 --> 37:29.280
Your brother said
that his fell apart,

37:29.282 --> 37:31.282
so... here ya go.

37:31.284 --> 37:32.351
Jesus.

37:32.353 --> 37:34.219
Does it come
in another color?

37:36.557 --> 37:37.689
All righty, then.

37:37.691 --> 37:38.957
Um, See ya.

37:40.561 --> 37:42.695
You know what?
I'm sorry, man. I...

37:45.232 --> 37:48.299
I, uh...

37:49.903 --> 37:51.236
My father,

37:51.238 --> 37:52.437
who I've never met before
in my life,

37:52.439 --> 37:54.773
just kind of showed up
and wants to hang.

37:56.910 --> 37:59.044
Just out of nowhere?

38:00.113 --> 38:01.447
Yeah.

38:03.650 --> 38:04.850
What do I do?

38:04.852 --> 38:06.785
Like...

38:06.787 --> 38:09.320
I don't know if I should
smoke a joint with the guy

38:09.322 --> 38:10.922
or kick the shit
out of him.

38:13.594 --> 38:16.661
Well, maybe
a little bit of both.

38:21.735 --> 38:23.535
You want to get drunk
with me?

38:25.939 --> 38:27.606
Yeah.

38:27.608 --> 38:29.508
All right.

38:37.951 --> 38:39.284
After school,

38:39.286 --> 38:41.152
you're gonna go
to Allison's house, okay?

38:41.154 --> 38:43.354
Okay.

38:43.356 --> 38:44.890
Because I...
I have to work.

38:44.892 --> 38:46.425
Okay.

38:46.427 --> 38:48.026
Allison's nice, right?

38:48.028 --> 38:49.228
Yeah.

38:49.230 --> 38:50.462
Right.

38:53.366 --> 38:54.566
But, tomorrow,

38:54.568 --> 38:57.569
I'm taking you to school
just like always.

38:57.571 --> 38:58.637
Okay.

39:04.044 --> 39:05.344
Hey.

39:06.780 --> 39:07.979
You okay?

39:07.981 --> 39:09.415
Yeah.

39:10.584 --> 39:13.518
Lena, I'll pick you up later,
all right?

39:13.520 --> 39:15.154
Okay.

39:21.528 --> 39:23.262
I gotta go see Smurf.

39:23.264 --> 39:24.729
I'll be back later.

39:24.731 --> 39:26.265
Okay.

39:28.802 --> 39:30.269
Wait. J.

39:33.073 --> 39:35.074
I had...

39:35.076 --> 39:37.109
I had sex with someone
last night.

39:44.952 --> 39:46.752
I gotta go.

40:18.519 --> 40:20.119
I won't be able
to pick her up

40:20.121 --> 40:21.653
until after 6:00.

40:21.655 --> 40:24.389
Okay, yeah.
I made her a lunch.

40:24.391 --> 40:25.857
Great. Thank you.

40:25.859 --> 40:27.993
Uh-huh. See you soon.

40:44.812 --> 40:46.145
God damn it.

40:51.418 --> 40:53.152
Hey! Asshole!

40:53.154 --> 40:55.420
Get up!
What? Jesus.

40:55.422 --> 40:57.088
Why are the two burn-outs
sleeping next to the pool?

40:57.090 --> 40:59.424
Because I didn't want them
sleeping on the driveway.

40:59.426 --> 41:00.759
Why are they here
at all?

41:00.761 --> 41:02.561
Deran should get the chance
to know his father.

41:02.563 --> 41:04.830
I told you to get rid of them!
Oh, you "told" me?

41:04.832 --> 41:06.097
That's right!
Is that right?!

41:06.099 --> 41:07.699
Yes! I told you!

41:09.436 --> 41:11.170
God damn it!

41:11.172 --> 41:12.771
God damn it!

41:20.514 --> 41:22.781
Mollies from the pill mill?

41:27.454 --> 41:28.854
Those two
shouldn't be here!

41:28.856 --> 41:31.190
It's fine, man!
I've locked the door.

42:50.137 --> 42:52.671
<i>How you been, baby?</i>

42:52.673 --> 42:55.140
Good.
I was a little behind.

42:55.142 --> 42:56.475
<i>I was under the weather,</i>

42:56.477 --> 42:58.009
<i>but I think
I'm catching up now.</i>

42:58.011 --> 43:00.879
<i>You took those supplements
I told you about?</i>

43:00.881 --> 43:02.081
<i>I did.</i>

43:02.083 --> 43:04.283
<i>Any side effects?</i>

43:04.285 --> 43:06.485
<i>None so far.</i>

43:06.487 --> 43:08.019
That's great.

43:08.021 --> 43:11.756
<i>My lawyer
needs to see you.</i>

43:11.758 --> 43:13.726
Yeah,
I'll pay him a visit soon.

43:15.963 --> 43:19.031
<i>It's hard to run a business
all by yourself, isn't it?</i>

43:21.635 --> 43:23.635
<i>Everybody chipped in.</i>

43:25.572 --> 43:27.572
And they all took
the right dose?

43:27.574 --> 43:28.907
'Cause, you know,
if you take

43:28.909 --> 43:31.110
<i>just a little bit more
than you should,</i>

43:31.112 --> 43:33.445
<i>it can be very dangerous.</i>

43:34.115 --> 43:36.247
<i>Everyone's good.</i>

43:38.319 --> 43:40.419
<i>Tell me
some other news.</i>

43:42.189 --> 43:43.555
<i>Um...</i>

43:44.725 --> 43:46.125
<i>We have a visitor.</i>

43:46.127 --> 43:47.458
<i>Oh?</i>

43:47.460 --> 43:49.328
His name's Billy.

43:54.601 --> 43:56.267
<i>Billy?
Deran's dad.</i>

43:56.269 --> 43:59.204
<i>Billy is in our house?</i>

43:59.206 --> 44:00.605
<i>Yeah.</i>

44:00.607 --> 44:02.207
<i>Get him out, J.</i>

44:02.209 --> 44:03.542
<i>Okay.</i>

44:03.544 --> 44:04.876
<i>Don't okay me.</i>

44:04.878 --> 44:06.878
<i>Get... him... out.</i>

44:06.880 --> 44:08.147
<i>I will.</i>

44:10.083 --> 44:13.152
If you don't protect
your property,

44:13.154 --> 44:16.822
<i>the wolves will come.</i>

45:07.274 --> 45:09.140
Hey, Pope.
