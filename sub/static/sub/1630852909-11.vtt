A NETFLIX SERIES

00:20.840 --> 00:22.480
<i>Fala galera! </i>How is everyone?

00:25.960 --> 00:28.000
Welcome to Sky Vibes!

00:28.080 --> 00:30.240
This is a special day for streaming.

00:30.320 --> 00:33.440
All right,
for those just logging on, I'm Charlie.

00:33.520 --> 00:34.440
<i>I'm Nati.</i>

00:34.520 --> 00:38.120
<i>Now, the moment you've been waiting for.</i>
<i>It's none other than…</i>

00:38.200 --> 00:40.320
<i>The Monzo Twins!</i>

00:44.080 --> 00:45.200
<i>What's up, guys?</i>

00:45.280 --> 00:46.560
<i>We wanted to remind you</i>

00:46.640 --> 00:49.400
<i>that you can donate</i>
<i>on the Save Cielo streaming page.</i>

00:49.480 --> 00:50.720
<i>We're counting on you</i>

00:50.800 --> 00:54.200
<i>to keep Cielo Grande running</i>
<i>and to keep enjoying this amazing place.</i>

00:54.280 --> 00:55.720
Let's do it, bro!

01:04.600 --> 01:08.360
<i>The Monzo Twins</i>

01:08.440 --> 01:10.600
<i>Too bad</i>

01:13.680 --> 01:15.000
<i>I didn't want to judge you</i>

01:15.080 --> 01:16.440
<i>You're special</i>

01:16.520 --> 01:20.000
<i>We're together, baby</i>
<i>For good or for worse</i>

01:20.080 --> 01:23.000
<i>I know you said this is just a game</i>

01:23.080 --> 01:26.160
<i>I was hoping you would change your mind</i>

01:26.240 --> 01:29.640
<i>You're with that other guy</i>
<i>He doesn't really love you</i>

01:29.720 --> 01:32.640
<i>Girl, sometimes you even think he's crazy</i>

01:32.720 --> 01:34.000
<i>I'm not wrong</i>

01:34.080 --> 01:35.800
<i>If you had considered me</i>

01:35.880 --> 01:39.240
<i>Something good could have happened</i>

01:39.320 --> 01:42.280
<i>And now I'm telling you what a shame</i>

01:42.360 --> 01:45.680
<i>What a shame that you're with him</i>

01:45.760 --> 01:46.960
<i>Too bad…</i>

01:47.040 --> 01:48.240
You were amazing today.

01:49.240 --> 01:51.080
I just love the sound of your voice.

01:51.160 --> 01:52.120
Thanks.

01:53.120 --> 01:57.680
It wasn't enough to beat Natasha,
but I won other things.

01:59.240 --> 02:02.440
<i>Tonight I'm calling you</i>

02:02.520 --> 02:05.520
<i>To tell you I love you</i>

02:05.600 --> 02:08.400
<i>My heart is broken again</i>

02:08.480 --> 02:11.080
<i>I wanted to try and it didn't work again</i>

02:11.160 --> 02:15.440
<i>I want to know if someday</i>
<i>You'll love me the way I love you</i>

02:15.520 --> 02:18.200
<i>I give you all my love</i>

02:18.800 --> 02:21.520
<i>I'm telling the truth, I can't breathe…</i>

02:34.640 --> 02:38.160
<i>Now you're with that other guy…</i>

02:38.240 --> 02:39.640
It looks the same, huh?

02:40.280 --> 02:41.440
<i>Too bad…</i>

02:41.520 --> 02:43.800
I thought the same thing
when I first came in.

02:44.400 --> 02:46.240
<i>I keep asking if you've considered…</i>

02:46.320 --> 02:47.720
Let's say hi.

02:47.800 --> 02:50.040
<i>What a shame…</i>

02:50.120 --> 02:51.520
Congratulations, daughter!

02:51.600 --> 02:53.120
<i>Too bad you can't see…</i>

02:53.200 --> 02:54.160
Daughters!

02:54.240 --> 02:56.360
<i>Too bad I didn't find you…</i>

02:57.000 --> 02:58.520
Dad,

02:58.600 --> 03:00.400
I think we should tell Ian.

03:01.120 --> 03:02.200
Tell me what?

03:03.560 --> 03:04.560
Mom, come here.

03:05.320 --> 03:06.200
Ian…

03:07.080 --> 03:07.920
Ian,

03:08.840 --> 03:10.400
Luz is our sister.

03:10.480 --> 03:11.920
<i>I keep asking…</i>

03:12.000 --> 03:13.080
What?

03:13.760 --> 03:15.160
Come here. We have to talk.

03:15.840 --> 03:16.920
-Yeah.
-Come with me.

03:17.000 --> 03:20.000
<i>I have a problem I can't avoid</i>

03:20.080 --> 03:22.160
<i>All I can do is sing…</i>

03:22.240 --> 03:24.560
I'm happy you wanna tell your brother.

03:24.640 --> 03:27.360
Dad, don't act like nothing happened.

03:27.440 --> 03:29.360
I can understand what you did,

03:29.880 --> 03:30.840
but now

03:31.720 --> 03:33.320
I can't forget all the lies.

03:33.400 --> 03:35.720
<i>Too bad I didn't find you…</i>

03:35.800 --> 03:37.200
Maybe with time.

03:37.840 --> 03:39.600
<i>What a shame</i>

03:39.680 --> 03:42.320
<i>What a shame you go with him</i>

03:42.400 --> 03:44.480
<i>What a shame you can't see me</i>

03:44.560 --> 03:45.400
Come with me.

03:46.000 --> 03:48.720
<i>What a shame I didn't find you</i>

04:02.480 --> 04:03.600
All right!

04:05.080 --> 04:06.080
Good job, guys!

04:09.080 --> 04:12.480
Thanks so much, Juan, Fer.
That was amazing.

04:12.560 --> 04:16.080
We're so happy
to be here saving Cielo Grande,

04:16.160 --> 04:18.280
<i>and we need your help.</i>

04:18.360 --> 04:21.720
<i>A small donation can change our history.</i>

04:21.800 --> 04:25.120
<i>And now, the surprise artists.</i>

04:25.200 --> 04:27.960
<i>A band that left its mark</i>
<i>in the punk rock world,</i>

04:28.040 --> 04:32.120
<i>here exclusively</i>
<i>for Save Cielo, our friends,</i>

04:32.200 --> 04:36.160
<i>Toxic Garbage!</i>

04:52.160 --> 04:54.720
<i>Your mom kicked you out</i>

04:57.400 --> 05:01.960
<i>Get to work! You aren't normal!</i>

05:03.000 --> 05:05.680
<i>You want a video, car, and driver</i>

05:05.760 --> 05:10.920
<i>But you don't have a scrap</i>

05:13.640 --> 05:16.560
<i>I want something else, to cry</i>

05:16.640 --> 05:22.560
<i>Looking for work or begging</i>

05:49.480 --> 05:51.560
<i>You earned it</i>

05:54.560 --> 05:59.920
<i>You're a real waste</i>

06:08.600 --> 06:10.480
<i>I told you</i>
<i>What are you going to do?</i>

06:10.560 --> 06:14.040
Look! The platform works great.

06:14.120 --> 06:17.280
You can see
all the money being donated here.

06:17.880 --> 06:19.280
-Nice!
-Yeah!

06:32.240 --> 06:33.560
No!

06:34.160 --> 06:35.040
Great!

06:38.840 --> 06:40.800
Thank you.

06:40.880 --> 06:42.280
SO COOL!

06:42.360 --> 06:43.960
-Bravo!
-Thank you, guys.

06:45.040 --> 06:46.240
GAVE $25 US

06:46.320 --> 06:47.480
SUPER COOL

06:47.560 --> 06:48.840
All right.

06:48.920 --> 06:51.080
The next performance.

06:51.160 --> 06:54.280
I'm sure many of you
have been waiting for this.

06:54.880 --> 06:59.440
Singing an original song for Save Cielo,
it's Luz and Steffi!

06:59.520 --> 07:00.480
All right!

07:15.840 --> 07:18.440
<i>The wind on my face, no worries</i>

07:18.520 --> 07:20.720
<i>Rocking my soul in the sun's rays</i>

07:20.800 --> 07:23.960
<i>The heat hits my palm softly</i>

07:24.040 --> 07:27.520
<i>I hold onto the moment, I feel this calm</i>

07:28.280 --> 07:31.000
<i>I feel this calm</i>

07:31.960 --> 07:34.440
<i>Warm beauty</i>

07:34.520 --> 07:36.760
<i>This sensation</i>

07:37.640 --> 07:39.880
<i>Warm beauty</i>

07:39.960 --> 07:42.000
<i>An imitation</i>

07:42.680 --> 07:48.280
<i>Moving through the waves is my strength</i>

07:48.360 --> 07:52.200
<i>Warm beauty</i>

07:53.640 --> 07:56.160
<i>Engines rumbling in Manila</i>

07:56.240 --> 07:58.920
<i>I feel strength, tension and more</i>

07:59.000 --> 08:01.880
<i>The wind in my face, no worries</i>

08:01.960 --> 08:06.240
<i>Holding on for a moment in the sunrays</i>

08:06.720 --> 08:09.480
<i>Sun rays</i>

08:10.200 --> 08:13.160
<i>Warm beauty</i>

08:13.240 --> 08:15.840
<i>Nature</i>

08:15.920 --> 08:18.200
<i>Warm beauty…</i>

08:20.160 --> 08:23.120
-It's amazing they're sisters, isn't it?
-Yeah.

08:24.240 --> 08:25.320
Amazing.

08:26.760 --> 08:28.400
<i>Warm beauty</i>

08:28.480 --> 08:30.200
Look at the connection they have.

08:31.680 --> 08:34.560
<i>Lying in the water as if floating</i>

08:34.640 --> 08:37.160
<i>The impulse takes me, the swim calls me</i>

08:37.240 --> 08:40.080
<i>The heat hits my palm softly</i>

08:40.160 --> 08:44.360
<i>I'm at one with this calm</i>

08:44.960 --> 08:46.080
<i>It comes this calm…</i>

08:46.160 --> 08:49.360
Well, in the end,
we didn't have luck with the girls.

08:50.000 --> 08:53.000
So what, bro?
We have plenty of trips ahead.

08:53.080 --> 08:53.960
Of course.

08:54.040 --> 08:56.520
<i>Warm beauty</i>

08:56.600 --> 08:58.880
<i>Nature</i>

08:59.480 --> 09:01.640
<i>Warm beauty</i>

09:04.520 --> 09:10.200
<i>Moving through the waves is my strength</i>

09:10.280 --> 09:12.840
<i>Warm beauty</i>

09:12.920 --> 09:15.600
<i>That's enough, yeah</i>

09:15.680 --> 09:18.400
<i>Warm beauty</i>

09:18.480 --> 09:21.080
<i>With this imitation, yeah</i>

09:21.160 --> 09:23.560
<i>Warm beauty</i>

09:23.640 --> 09:26.640
<i>Warm beauty</i>

09:26.720 --> 09:29.200
<i>Warm beauty</i>

09:29.280 --> 09:33.480
<i>Warm beauty</i>

09:51.720 --> 09:53.880
-Great.
-Thanks.

09:55.920 --> 09:57.960
<i>Now, our last song,</i>

09:58.040 --> 10:01.360
<i>a song that describes the situation</i>
<i>for many of us, but not all.</i>

10:01.440 --> 10:02.600
<i>Luckily!</i>

10:14.720 --> 10:16.720
<i>It's always the same</i>

10:16.800 --> 10:18.560
<i>But I don't understand</i>

10:18.640 --> 10:20.440
<i>I want something with you</i>

10:20.520 --> 10:22.320
<i>But can't have it</i>

10:22.400 --> 10:24.320
<i>If I see you in my dreams</i>

10:24.400 --> 10:26.240
<i>We're friends</i>

10:26.320 --> 10:28.160
<i>And that isn't good</i>

10:28.240 --> 10:30.520
<i>But you let me</i>

10:30.600 --> 10:32.560
<i>The only option here</i>

10:32.640 --> 10:34.440
<i>There's no love</i>

10:34.520 --> 10:36.600
<i>I can't avoid it</i>

10:36.680 --> 10:38.600
<i>Just accept it</i>

10:38.680 --> 10:40.480
<i>The only option here</i>

10:40.560 --> 10:42.200
<i>There's no love</i>

10:42.280 --> 10:44.400
<i>I can't avoid it</i>

10:44.480 --> 10:46.040
<i>Just accept it</i>

11:09.040 --> 11:12.720
<i>Being just friends, I don't know if I can</i>

11:12.800 --> 11:14.680
<i>It doesn't add up</i>

11:14.760 --> 11:16.360
<i>It doesn't make sense to me</i>

11:16.440 --> 11:20.480
<i>Maybe we have to be apart</i>

11:20.560 --> 11:24.560
<i>I could be with you, together in my bed</i>

11:32.240 --> 11:36.000
<i>It's so hard to see</i>
<i>I don't know what to do</i>

11:36.080 --> 11:39.720
<i>I think I want to know</i>
<i>That I won't escape</i>

11:39.800 --> 11:41.880
<i>I suffer</i>
<i>You are going to affect me</i>

11:41.960 --> 11:43.760
<i>With how far away you are</i>

11:43.840 --> 11:45.800
<i>I cry, I can't forget</i>

11:45.880 --> 11:47.360
<i>There's no getting over this!</i>

12:12.960 --> 12:13.840
Thank you.

12:13.920 --> 12:17.560
A big thanks to everyone
for collaborating, participating,

12:17.640 --> 12:19.040
clapping, and dancing.

12:19.120 --> 12:23.360
<i>We'll be uploading videos to</i>
<i>the Save Cielo channel in a few minutes.</i>

12:23.440 --> 12:25.760
<i>We haven't reached our goal to save Cielo.</i>

12:25.840 --> 12:28.880
If you want to make a donation,
you have until tomorrow.

12:28.960 --> 12:30.800
Thank you all again.

12:30.880 --> 12:34.480
<i>And a special shout-out to Ron</i>
<i>for his amazing donation.</i>

12:34.560 --> 12:36.080
Thanks, Ron!

12:39.280 --> 12:41.280
<i>Valeu galera!</i>

12:44.160 --> 12:45.160
All right!

12:48.640 --> 12:49.640
Thanks.

12:50.640 --> 12:51.880
All right!

13:01.400 --> 13:05.280
The donations are a little more
than half of what we owe the bank.

13:06.400 --> 13:07.600
That's pretty good.

13:08.280 --> 13:11.640
We're close, but it isn't enough.

13:28.080 --> 13:29.160
<i>Good morning.</i>

13:29.240 --> 13:32.760
<i>Yesterday you were the star</i>
<i>of the day and the night. I miss you.</i>

13:37.680 --> 13:39.760
Only three-quarters of the first payment?

13:43.840 --> 13:44.960
Guys!

13:45.040 --> 13:48.120
I can't believe you're leaving.
I had a great time with you.

13:48.200 --> 13:49.040
Thanks.

13:49.120 --> 13:50.680
I wish you the best of luck.

13:50.760 --> 13:52.840
Luck with girls? Like we've had?

13:52.920 --> 13:54.880
No, Juan. With your channel, obviously.

13:56.440 --> 13:59.360
Thanks for coming, twins! You're the best.

13:59.440 --> 14:01.200
-You too. I mean it.
-Guys!

14:02.520 --> 14:05.720
-Have a good trip.
-Guys, have you seen Matrix?

14:05.800 --> 14:07.360
She should be here soon.

14:07.920 --> 14:09.960
-Is that your bag?
-Yeah.

14:10.040 --> 14:13.080
My work at Cielo is done.

14:13.720 --> 14:15.760
Little panda and I are gonna travel.

14:17.360 --> 14:18.800
But that's no good, Noda!

14:22.160 --> 14:23.800
Look, she…

14:24.560 --> 14:25.560
Noda!

14:28.920 --> 14:30.320
I don't know what to do.

14:30.960 --> 14:32.720
If I could go back in time…

14:33.520 --> 14:36.160
Before that,
you have to give yourself time.

14:36.240 --> 14:37.320
That heals all.

14:38.240 --> 14:41.120
-Everything would be different if--
-This is how it is.

14:41.200 --> 14:44.400
We can mix things up,
but we have to look forward.

14:45.440 --> 14:46.280
Yes.

14:47.560 --> 14:49.600
Wanting to change the past is useless.

14:55.280 --> 14:58.200
Little panda.

14:58.280 --> 15:00.080
Always with you, piglet.

15:04.440 --> 15:05.280
Hey.

15:05.800 --> 15:07.040
You got up on your own?

15:07.560 --> 15:09.800
No! I can't believe it!

15:10.440 --> 15:12.720
The day we don't have to train

15:12.800 --> 15:15.760
is the day I don't have to get you up
for breakfast.

15:15.840 --> 15:18.240
It's the first day I've actually rested.

15:19.280 --> 15:24.600
I blocked Natasha on all my accounts.
We won't hear from her for a while.

15:24.680 --> 15:28.320
Hey, what are you going to do about…

15:28.400 --> 15:29.400
About what?

15:31.200 --> 15:32.560
About your new family.

15:34.160 --> 15:35.360
You want the truth?

15:36.520 --> 15:37.400
I don't know.

15:41.800 --> 15:43.640
-Shall we?
-Let's go.

15:50.480 --> 15:51.600
Well, guys,

15:52.120 --> 15:53.400
as you all saw,

15:53.480 --> 15:58.480
we didn't get the money we needed
to pay the bank.

16:01.640 --> 16:03.520
In any case, the bank

16:05.240 --> 16:06.800
accepted what we have.

16:06.880 --> 16:09.320
They saw the Save Cielo stream

16:09.400 --> 16:12.360
and said we could pay the rest
in the next payment.

16:13.640 --> 16:16.640
You did it, guys! We did it.

16:17.240 --> 16:18.880
Great!

16:27.480 --> 16:29.800
Thanks for helping with the competition.

16:30.400 --> 16:32.000
Had it not been for you,

16:32.080 --> 16:34.560
we wouldn't have gotten
even half of what we have.

16:34.640 --> 16:35.760
No.

16:35.840 --> 16:37.440
You did more than I did.

16:39.320 --> 16:40.560
It starts somewhere.

16:44.080 --> 16:44.960
Dad.

16:46.320 --> 16:48.000
I think I'm going to stay here.

16:48.800 --> 16:54.040
I want to hang out with Luz for a few days
and get to know my mom a little better.

16:55.560 --> 17:00.280
Sounds good. Whatever makes you happy.
You know you can always count on me.

17:01.240 --> 17:03.040
Come back home whenever you want.

17:04.840 --> 17:05.720
I know.

17:09.360 --> 17:10.280
I love you.

17:22.280 --> 17:25.520
I can't believe it!
It's like a gift from destiny.

17:25.600 --> 17:28.920
Yeah, a fantasy,
like gnomes walking in the woods

17:29.000 --> 17:30.440
of Cielo Grande.

17:30.520 --> 17:33.240
-We better go, Charlie.
-Yeah. Let's go.

17:33.320 --> 17:34.720
-Wait.
-What's that mark?

17:34.800 --> 17:38.760
I've wanted to tell you something,
but I never found the right time.

17:38.840 --> 17:39.880
What is it?

17:40.400 --> 17:43.880
Thanks to you, I found
a part of me I didn't know existed.

17:45.320 --> 17:47.080
What? What did you find?

17:47.160 --> 17:48.000
That…

17:48.680 --> 17:52.080
I enrolled in college
because I like to write.

17:53.240 --> 17:56.240
The bad news is
I'm gonna have to leave Cielo Grande.

17:56.320 --> 17:58.840
I found my calling. Writing.

17:59.560 --> 18:00.440
Nati,

18:01.600 --> 18:03.600
you'll be the best writer in the world.

18:19.720 --> 18:23.600
Will you come to Mexico?
I'd love to make up for lost time.

18:23.680 --> 18:24.760
I'd love to.

18:35.760 --> 18:36.760
Hey!

18:45.880 --> 18:48.080
I'd like to stay with you guys.

18:48.160 --> 18:50.000
We'll set up a vacation with them.

18:50.080 --> 18:53.640
In the meantime,
I won't miss a single one of your videos.

19:00.520 --> 19:01.520
Have a nice trip.

19:06.360 --> 19:08.760
We agreed
Luz would visit us in Mexico soon.

19:08.840 --> 19:10.320
Will you come too?

19:11.640 --> 19:14.080
Okay, the boat is ready. Let's go.

19:14.160 --> 19:16.440
Thanks for everything. It's been great.

19:21.480 --> 19:22.600
Until next time.

19:26.400 --> 19:27.560
Thanks so much.

19:41.480 --> 19:42.600
I'm gonna miss you.

19:43.920 --> 19:45.080
We'll miss you too.

19:54.800 --> 19:58.200
I have some days off,
and I'd love to spend them with you.

20:00.080 --> 20:02.000
A real vacation at Cielo Grande?

20:03.800 --> 20:04.720
Great idea.

20:04.800 --> 20:05.640
It is.

20:06.160 --> 20:09.040
Nothing better than spending it
with my mom and my sister.

20:49.360 --> 20:50.680
Welcome, Miss Rossi.

20:50.760 --> 20:52.400
-Where are you going?
-Milan.

20:56.120 --> 20:57.880
<i>Last call for flight 8699 to Milan.</i>

20:57.920 --> 20:59.320
STEFFI DESERVED TO WIN!

20:59.400 --> 21:02.120
NATASHA STOLE SUMMER CRUSH

21:08.760 --> 21:09.640
Have a nice trip.

21:13.440 --> 21:15.520
Sorry. I'm not going.

21:26.840 --> 21:27.960
Hey, Oliver.

21:28.680 --> 21:30.520
Could you come to Buenos Aires?

21:32.240 --> 21:34.880
We have to talk about
the future of Cielo Grande.

21:39.560 --> 21:40.960
<i>Now</i>

21:41.040 --> 21:42.600
<i>It's now</i>

21:42.680 --> 21:44.120

21:44.200 --> 21:45.720

21:55.120 --> 21:58.240

<i>I could be wrong</i>

21:58.320 --> 22:01.400
<i>Together we're much more</i>

22:03.080 --> 22:06.040
<i>It's true</i>

22:06.120 --> 22:09.200
<i>I don't know if it will work</i>

22:09.280 --> 22:12.520
<i>And it's true</i>

22:12.600 --> 22:15.240
<i>We'll have to try</i>

22:17.000 --> 22:18.440
<i>Now</i>

22:23.160 --> 22:27.440

22:29.400 --> 22:32.400
<i>It's not about winning, not about losing</i>

22:32.480 --> 22:35.560
<i>We have to try</i>

22:35.640 --> 22:37.800
<i>It's now</i>

22:37.880 --> 22:39.080
