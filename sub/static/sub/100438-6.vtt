The fact
that our so-called leaders

38:16.555 --> 38:18.426
were nowhere to be seen
last night.

- For too long,
the fat cats of San Bonifacio

38:24.911 --> 38:28.001
have profited off the sweat
of the working man.

38:28.044 --> 38:30.438
And woman.
I see you, ladies.

38:30.482 --> 38:31.657
- Hi!
[scattered applause]

38:32.701 --> 38:34.834
- Big Tony Salazar
and his cronies--

38:34.877 --> 38:36.488
they use City Hall
as a piggy bank.

38:36.531 --> 38:39.665
It's time for change.

38:39.708 --> 38:44.539
The lights are back on,
but I want to see them shine.

38:44.583 --> 38:45.888
That's why I'm announcing

38:45.932 --> 38:49.631
my candidacy
for November's election.

38:49.675 --> 38:52.765
I want to be mayor
for all of San Bonifacio.

38:52.808 --> 38:56.986
Let's move this city forward,
together!

38:57.030 --> 39:00.686
- Why now?
What is she up to?

39:00.729 --> 39:02.383
- I was trying to tell you.

39:02.427 --> 39:04.820
She's the one
that planted the story

39:04.864 --> 39:08.041
in the newspaper
about Felicity.

39:08.084 --> 39:09.390
It was her.
