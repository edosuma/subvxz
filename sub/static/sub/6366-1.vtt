WEBVTT

02:30.817 --> 02:32.401
Fuck me.

02:37.866 --> 02:39.575
Hi, Job.

02:40.785 --> 02:43.662
- You're out.
- I'm out.

02:45.915 --> 02:49.585
Listen, I know why you're here,
but I cannot help you.

02:49.919 --> 02:51.503
Hey!

02:54.382 --> 02:56.049
Just give me the address, Job.

02:57.719 --> 03:00.345
Why are you even assuming I know how to...

03:00.513 --> 03:02.556
No, no, no! Motherfucker!

03:05.143 --> 03:06.560
Quit breaking my shit.

03:07.770 --> 03:10.647
Baby, you know how this works.
The trail is cold.

03:13.985 --> 03:18.113
Okay, okay, okay!
Just stop the carnage.

03:33.546 --> 03:36.548
You've got the whole world in front of you...

03:36.716 --> 03:40.719
...and you're going to the one place
you absolutely should not go.

05:13.813 --> 05:15.147
What, are you crazy?

06:00.735 --> 06:02.319
Hey!

08:27.340 --> 08:29.466
Morning, everyone.

08:30.801 --> 08:34.804
I've reviewed the defense's
motion to dismiss.

08:34.972 --> 08:38.016
And based on the evidence,
or the lack thereof...

08:38.184 --> 08:41.686
...it's my opinion that the prosecution
cannot sustain the burden for a trial...

08:41.896 --> 08:43.730
- Are you kidding?
...so I'm finding for the defense.

08:43.898 --> 08:45.190
Case dismissed.

08:48.236 --> 08:50.904
You can't take this to trial, Gordon.

08:51.572 --> 08:54.991
You should be thanking me
for saving you the embarrassment.

09:13.469 --> 09:15.095
- Gordon.
- Jackson.

09:15.263 --> 09:18.014
That a judge in your pocket
or you just happy to see me?

09:24.397 --> 09:25.772
Mr. Mayor.

09:33.030 --> 09:36.700
- Jesus Christ, Gordon.
- Oh, pace yourself, Dan.

09:38.536 --> 09:40.662
Our day will come.

09:41.539 --> 09:44.708
Guys like Kai Proctor
don't go down easy.

09:52.425 --> 09:54.467
Carrie.

09:56.679 --> 09:58.054
Hey.

10:00.057 --> 10:02.726
You'll get him next time, counselor.

10:02.893 --> 10:05.770
Yeah, I am ready for this day to be over.

10:08.190 --> 10:09.608
Again?

10:09.775 --> 10:11.401
Yeah.

10:12.862 --> 10:14.487
It's nothing to freak out about.

10:14.655 --> 10:16.906
We're not freaking out.
We're just talking to you.

10:17.074 --> 10:19.701
My point is we don't solve
our problems with violence.

10:19.869 --> 10:21.745
I just completed another level.

10:21.912 --> 10:23.830
Yeah, it happens every day, Dad.

10:23.998 --> 10:26.041
I just can't believe that you
kicked your teacher.

10:26.208 --> 10:28.501
- Substitute teacher.
- Oh, well, it's okay, then.

10:28.669 --> 10:30.670
He's a perv, Mom.
He tried to see down my shirt.

10:30.838 --> 10:32.964
With a shirt like that,
it doesn't take much trying.

10:33.132 --> 10:34.633
- So it's my fault?
- Gordon.

10:34.800 --> 10:37.552
So if I get molested by a teacher,
you'll just blame it on my shirt?

10:37.720 --> 10:39.137
- Deva, come on.
- Okay, all right.

10:41.390 --> 10:43.975
Max, honey, you have your inhaler?

10:46.354 --> 10:48.605
Dr. Welling referred Max
to another pulmonologist.

10:48.773 --> 10:50.190
We have an appointment next week.

10:50.358 --> 10:53.068
Okay. Great.

10:53.235 --> 10:56.821
- Is your shoulder bad today?
- Ah, it's just the usual.

10:56.989 --> 10:58.782
It'll be all right.

10:58.949 --> 11:00.492
I think I might grab a shower.

11:00.660 --> 11:02.285
- Okay.
- Okay?

11:18.135 --> 11:20.095
That's Beaty. Later.

11:49.583 --> 11:52.419
- You're late, bitch.
- Whatever, skank.

11:52.586 --> 11:54.337
So, are you in shit with your parents?

11:54.505 --> 11:57.340
- Yeah, when am I not?
- Ha, ha.

12:36.589 --> 12:38.089
Howdy.

12:41.719 --> 12:43.803
I'm gonna go with shitty day...

12:44.180 --> 12:47.182
...and whiskey neat.
- Whiskey's fine.

12:54.190 --> 12:56.149
And one for yourself.

13:03.783 --> 13:05.658
Are you coming or going?

13:07.119 --> 13:09.370
I'm still working that out.

13:14.710 --> 13:18.213
That's me, Sugar Bates...

13:18.380 --> 13:20.340
...in the cruiserweight years.

13:20.508 --> 13:22.675
When'd you drop him?

13:22.843 --> 13:24.636
Fifth?

13:24.804 --> 13:26.513
Eighth.

13:26.680 --> 13:29.182
He was a southpaw. They take longer.

13:31.060 --> 13:33.019
See, it was a title fight.

13:33.187 --> 13:35.355
I held the belt for 18 months.

13:35.523 --> 13:38.274
I used to hang it right up there.

13:38.442 --> 13:39.609
You know?

13:39.777 --> 13:42.028
A good conversation piece.

13:42.196 --> 13:44.322
But with this tough economy,
I had to pawn it...

13:44.490 --> 13:48.243
...a little while back
to pay for the leaking taps.

13:50.621 --> 13:52.580
That's a shame.

13:52.748 --> 13:54.582
Where are you from?

13:57.211 --> 13:58.920
Different places.

14:05.553 --> 14:07.262
Where'd you sit?

14:13.018 --> 14:14.561
Roscoe.

14:14.854 --> 14:17.230
I did eight years at Allenwood.

14:20.359 --> 14:22.026
You look fresh.

14:24.864 --> 14:31.452
Freedom.

14:46.093 --> 14:48.553
Always this quiet around here?

14:50.639 --> 14:53.516
Well, let's stimulate
the local economy.

14:53.684 --> 14:55.435
Next round's on me.

14:55.603 --> 14:57.061
Ha, ha. All right.

14:57.229 --> 15:00.398
All you tourists buying me drinks today.

15:01.984 --> 15:03.192
I'm not a tourist.

15:05.779 --> 15:07.572
My name is Lucas Hood.

15:07.740 --> 15:11.576
And come Monday, I'm being sworn in
as the new sheriff.

15:11.744 --> 15:13.620
Congratulations.

15:13.787 --> 15:17.206
Or should we say good luck?

15:17.374 --> 15:19.208
I'll take both, thanks.

15:19.376 --> 15:21.461
I spent nine years as sheriff
up in Church, Oregon.

15:21.629 --> 15:23.713
You ever heard of it?

15:23.881 --> 15:26.758
Yeah, I'm not surprised.
It's the armpit of the West.

15:26.926 --> 15:29.052
This is my first day east.

15:29.219 --> 15:31.471
I just drove clear across the country.

15:31.639 --> 15:33.181
There's less to see than you'd think.

15:33.349 --> 15:37.310
I thought the sheriff had to be elected.

15:37.478 --> 15:40.897
Usually, but under certain
circumstances, the mayor can bring in a ringer.

15:41.065 --> 15:43.900
He and Sheriff Morgan
are the ones who hired me so...

15:44.068 --> 15:46.361
I was looking forward to meeting
them when I got here.

15:46.528 --> 15:50.323
Yeah, well, that'd be quite a trick
since he died last Tuesday.

15:50.491 --> 15:51.824
Liver cancer.

15:52.660 --> 15:55.453
I think he thought he had more time.

15:58.457 --> 16:00.208
Aw, shit.

16:04.421 --> 16:06.047
Your boss know you're here?

16:06.215 --> 16:09.968
Don't worry about him. You know the drill.

16:18.018 --> 16:20.186
Look at this guy.

16:23.232 --> 16:24.899
Excuse me.

16:25.067 --> 16:27.026
Are we disturbing you?

16:27.194 --> 16:29.862
No, not at all.
This is just a very good steak.

16:31.073 --> 16:34.033
And I know that once I stand up
to deal with you fellas...

16:34.201 --> 16:36.869
...well, maybe you'll come quietly
or maybe I'll have to kill you...

16:37.037 --> 16:40.373
...but either way, this steak is gonna get cold.
And you can always reheat a steak...

16:40.541 --> 16:43.835
...but it's never quite the same. Hmm?

16:44.878 --> 16:48.756
You got some balls on you, motherfucker.

16:56.890 --> 16:59.142
Sheriff's Department. I'll take that gun now.

16:59.309 --> 17:01.144
No, you drop your fucking gun.

17:10.654 --> 17:12.947
That's the new STI, isn't it?

17:13.115 --> 17:15.366
- That's a hard gun to get.
- Who the fuck is this guy?

17:15.534 --> 17:18.161
- You sit your ass down.
- All right, hear me out, sheriff.

17:18.328 --> 17:20.455
- They got you outgunned.
- Damn straight we do.

17:20.622 --> 17:24.333
While on the other hand, if he shoots,
one of you boys is dead...

17:24.501 --> 17:27.420
...or shitting in a bag the rest of his life.
For what?

17:27.588 --> 17:31.049
The 200 bucks Sugar has in the register
at 4 p.m. On a Tuesday? Come on.

17:31.216 --> 17:34.343
So, Sheriff, why don't you
let them take the cash?

17:34.511 --> 17:35.845
Just let them take it.

17:36.013 --> 17:37.847
I'll buy enough drinks to make him whole.

17:38.015 --> 17:40.850
Everyone goes home happy.
What do you say?

17:42.644 --> 17:43.895
Come on.

17:50.486 --> 17:52.737
Oh, God!

18:27.689 --> 18:29.982
Am I dead?

18:31.318 --> 18:32.401
Yeah.

18:32.861 --> 18:35.279
It's my first day in town.

18:35.447 --> 18:36.614
Shit!

18:39.952 --> 18:41.327
Sorry.

18:42.496 --> 18:46.707
I hope my mother was right about God.

18:51.964 --> 18:55.424
Jesus ripshit Christ.

18:58.762 --> 19:01.264
This is what you call in the Bible...

19:01.431 --> 19:04.976
...a "clusterfuck of epic proportions."

19:06.520 --> 19:10.982
Two cons, three corpses,
one of them a cop.

19:11.358 --> 19:13.276
I don't like that math.

19:14.945 --> 19:16.863
You'd better get out of here.

19:22.703 --> 19:25.204
Well, they would have killed me
same as him.

19:25.372 --> 19:28.374
The least I can do is give you a head start.

19:29.251 --> 19:30.793
What about you?

19:30.961 --> 19:33.087
I got a few tricks.

19:34.423 --> 19:36.299
Go on, now. Get out of here.

20:05.204 --> 20:06.829
Hi, Ana.

20:11.877 --> 20:13.920
How did you find me?

20:16.632 --> 20:18.507
It was Job.

20:20.636 --> 20:22.220
It's a nice house.

20:25.015 --> 20:28.309
Yeah, it seems, um...

20:28.477 --> 20:30.811
...uh, solid.

20:31.480 --> 20:33.314
So, what do you have, two kids?

20:35.776 --> 20:38.110
- Yes.
- Yeah?

20:39.154 --> 20:40.488
How old?

20:40.656 --> 20:42.698
My son is 8.

20:44.451 --> 20:47.536
My daughter is 13.

20:47.704 --> 20:49.080
Hmm.

20:51.250 --> 20:52.667
She looks older.

21:01.510 --> 21:03.511
I can smell your perfume from here.

21:05.472 --> 21:08.432
Please, you're gonna have to leave.

21:08.600 --> 21:11.477
Please. Please.

21:12.562 --> 21:14.063
Ana.

21:14.231 --> 21:16.399
I'm not Ana anymore.

21:16.566 --> 21:18.025
My name is Carrie.

21:22.948 --> 21:23.990
Where were you?

21:24.157 --> 21:26.284
- I tried to visit.
- No. 15 years.

21:26.451 --> 21:28.995
- I drove up to those gates.
- You were here playing fucking house?

21:29.162 --> 21:31.455
- You have no idea how many times.
- Don't you tell me that.

21:31.623 --> 21:34.917
- Where the fuck were you?
- I don't have to justify myself to you.

21:35.085 --> 21:37.295
I have responsibilities.

21:37.462 --> 21:39.297
I have children.

21:41.174 --> 21:42.591
Okay?

21:44.261 --> 21:48.931
I have a husband who loves me.

21:52.602 --> 21:53.894
Hey.

21:55.772 --> 21:58.858
- It's me.
- Don't. I can't.

22:01.778 --> 22:04.322
You could have led Rabbit straight to me.

22:05.032 --> 22:07.533
What the fuck were you thinking?

22:13.373 --> 22:14.999
Okay.

22:17.544 --> 22:20.171
You moved on. I get it.

22:23.342 --> 22:26.510
So give me my cut
and you'll never see me again.

22:29.473 --> 22:31.015
I don't have the diamonds.

22:31.558 --> 22:33.267
What? What?

22:33.435 --> 22:36.354
After we screwed Rabbit like that
and you had gotten caught...

22:36.521 --> 22:39.190
No, no, I did not get caught.
There were two of us there that night!

22:39.358 --> 22:41.150
- Shh, shh! I know.
- I led them away from you!

22:41.318 --> 22:45.196
Listen, I tried to fence them.

22:45.364 --> 22:50.159
The guys I found,
these real bottom-feeders, Serbians...

22:53.663 --> 22:55.039
...they saw me coming.

22:57.834 --> 23:00.002
You're telling me you got rolled?

23:01.755 --> 23:05.299
Does it look like I'm sitting on $10 million?

23:16.353 --> 23:18.229
Mm.

23:22.526 --> 23:24.360
I don't get the girl.

23:25.070 --> 23:26.946
I don't get the money.

23:29.658 --> 23:33.119
I spent 15 years picturing this day...

23:33.286 --> 23:36.705
...and I gotta tell you,
this is not how I saw it playing out.

23:36.873 --> 23:40.042
I'm so sorry. I am so fucking sorry.

23:41.795 --> 23:44.797
- Hey, babe, you out here?
- Shit.

23:46.967 --> 23:50.469
Yeah. Hey, honey. Raccoon.

24:10.323 --> 24:11.365
Christ.

24:11.533 --> 24:13.159
You trying to kill me?

24:13.994 --> 24:15.619
Have you picked a spot yet?

24:19.958 --> 24:23.544
You one of them complicated types.
Is that it?

24:28.300 --> 24:31.177
No, some people just don't know
simple when they see it.

24:46.318 --> 24:48.152
Don't seem right...

24:49.070 --> 24:52.281
...burying the sheriff with that pond scum.

24:52.449 --> 24:54.742
What, do you wanna dig him his own hole?

24:54.910 --> 24:57.369
Yeah, that'd be the Christian thing to do.

25:01.583 --> 25:03.042
That you?

25:33.532 --> 25:35.366
- Hello?
- Sheriff Hood...

25:35.534 --> 25:38.244
...it's Mayor Dan Kendall.
Am I catching you at a bad time?

25:43.083 --> 25:44.625
Sheriff?

25:45.126 --> 25:46.502
Are you there?

25:52.133 --> 25:54.718
- Yeah, this is Hood.
- How's the drive going?

25:59.140 --> 26:00.975
A lot less to see than you'd think.

26:01.142 --> 26:04.812
Well, I just wanted to confirm tomorrow.
You'll be in town by then?

26:05.689 --> 26:07.273
- Should be, yeah.
- Great.

26:07.440 --> 26:09.942
So that's 1:00 at Miles' Diner.

26:10.110 --> 26:12.319
I look forward to finally
meeting you in person.

26:12.487 --> 26:15.072
Great. I'll see you then.

26:17.242 --> 26:20.911
Now tell me you got some kind
of master plan here.

26:27.002 --> 26:31.922
Well, I usually just get by with my charm.

26:40.849 --> 26:42.933
- Hishi Salon.
- I need a favor.

26:43.101 --> 26:45.519
And I need $5000 for all the shit you broke.

26:45.687 --> 26:48.564
- I'll make it 10.
- Fuck you!

26:49.774 --> 26:52.693
- Speak.
- I need to become someone else.

26:52.861 --> 26:54.445
Honey child, don't we all?

26:54.613 --> 26:56.322
Someone specific.

26:59.075 --> 27:01.368
- Name?
- Lucas Hood...

27:01.536 --> 27:02.953
...of Church, Oregon.

27:03.121 --> 27:05.122
Shouldn't be a problem.

27:05.290 --> 27:08.375
Unless he's a motherfucking cop.
Are you kidding me?

27:08.543 --> 27:10.002
I need it quick, Job.

27:10.170 --> 27:11.962
Baby, you just sat for 15 years...

27:12.130 --> 27:16.133
...because you were the most notorious thief
in the country. Now you want to play cop?

27:16.301 --> 27:17.551
Can you do it?

27:17.719 --> 27:19.928
I mean, I have to hack
law-enforcement databases...

27:20.096 --> 27:21.764
...swap out fingerprints and photo IDs...

27:21.931 --> 27:24.099
...find any news article that
might have run a picture...

27:24.267 --> 27:26.226
- So you can't do it?
- Suck my tit, bitch!

27:26.394 --> 27:28.312
Of course I can do it.

27:29.648 --> 27:31.774
Take a couple days.
As for the credentials...

27:31.941 --> 27:33.984
...I can get you the papers,
but the badge itself...

27:34.152 --> 27:35.736
I got the badge.

27:35.904 --> 27:38.197
I don't even wanna know.

27:40.325 --> 27:42.951
You know, some cons,
the minute they get out...

27:43.119 --> 27:45.746
...they're just trying like hell to get back in.

27:45.914 --> 27:47.164
I'm not going back.

27:48.583 --> 27:52.753
Yeah, well, you got a revolutionary way
of staying out of trouble.

27:53.254 --> 27:54.505
Here.

27:54.673 --> 27:56.965
The pickup belonged to the sheriff.

28:01.971 --> 28:03.263
Thanks.

28:07.435 --> 28:08.811
Hey.

28:11.314 --> 28:13.148
You got a place to stay?

28:58.611 --> 29:00.362
No one's ever stolen from Rabbit.

29:52.916 --> 29:54.124
Okay.

29:58.254 --> 30:00.964
Hey, go in back and stay out of sight.

30:01.132 --> 30:03.592
- What for?
- Go now.

30:16.564 --> 30:18.482
Morning, Sugar.

30:18.650 --> 30:20.108
Kai.

30:32.372 --> 30:33.956
How are the headaches?

30:34.749 --> 30:37.042
Did those Mexican painkillers
I got you help?

30:37.210 --> 30:39.837
They did. Thanks.

30:43.258 --> 30:45.092
What brings you around?

30:46.511 --> 30:51.390
Randall and Munson.

30:51.558 --> 30:53.892
Munson, the bald one?

30:54.978 --> 30:58.313
One of the boys thought they might have been
headed out this way yesterday afternoon.

30:58.481 --> 31:00.274
Well, they didn't come here.

31:00.441 --> 31:02.359
If they did, I'd have taken notice.

31:04.112 --> 31:06.572
If any of my employees
ever stepped out of line...

31:06.739 --> 31:09.992
...hassled you in any way,
I'd expect you to call me.

31:10.159 --> 31:13.829
What I mean is I wouldn't want you
to take matters into your own hands.

31:13.997 --> 31:16.665
Ha, ha. Look at me.

31:16.833 --> 31:20.377
Nobody runs from a fight
faster than an old fighter.

31:24.382 --> 31:26.341
What happened to your title fight?

31:27.427 --> 31:30.846
Oh, I knocked it off the hook the other night,
busted up the frame.

31:31.014 --> 31:32.598
I'm having it redone.

31:39.397 --> 31:42.482
Ah. Thanks for the drink.

31:43.026 --> 31:46.445
You let me know if you need
any more of those painkillers.

32:16.768 --> 32:18.435
That's some car.

32:19.020 --> 32:22.022
Look, if you're thinking
of stealing from Kai Proctor...

32:22.190 --> 32:24.775
...you may as well take a bullet
and put it in your head now.

32:24.943 --> 32:26.485
Kai Proctor.

32:27.236 --> 32:28.278
There is a name.

32:28.446 --> 32:30.656
What the man doesn't own, he runs.

32:31.407 --> 32:35.369
What he doesn't run,
he burns to the ground.

32:35.787 --> 32:38.372
He seemed to like you well enough.

32:40.333 --> 32:42.960
We go back a ways.

32:43.878 --> 32:46.046
- Uh-huh.
- Listen.

32:46.506 --> 32:49.341
You don't seem like the kind of guy
who takes advice...

32:52.053 --> 32:54.262
...but I'm gonna try anyway.

32:58.017 --> 33:00.602
There's $400. Take it and go.

33:02.271 --> 33:04.690
- I can't.
- Look around.

33:04.857 --> 33:06.900
You're free, man.

33:10.446 --> 33:12.447
Pay you back in a few days.

34:31.736 --> 34:33.820
Good to meet you. Lucas Hood.

34:36.157 --> 34:38.700
Lucas Hood. How are...? How...?

34:56.177 --> 35:00.680
It's a legitimate concern
and I promise I'll talk to the school.

35:01.099 --> 35:03.767
Excuse me.

35:03.935 --> 35:05.018
- Say hi to Amy.
- Thank you.

35:05.186 --> 35:08.438
- Sheriff Hood?
- That's right.

35:08.981 --> 35:10.899
It's great to meet you.

35:11.192 --> 35:13.401
Yeah, you too.

35:14.695 --> 35:17.572
I know, I look young,
but that's just because I am.

35:19.200 --> 35:20.534
Have a seat.

35:39.220 --> 35:43.807
Job, two suits, badly tailored.
They're looking for you.

35:45.768 --> 35:47.519
Cops?

35:48.729 --> 35:50.605
Let's hope so.

35:52.024 --> 35:54.609
I want all the backup drives in the car now.

36:09.959 --> 36:11.001
Keep the engine running.

36:22.138 --> 36:25.265
Gentlemen, we don't actually open till 10...

36:25.433 --> 36:29.269
...but if you'll follow me back upstairs,
I'm sure we can find somewhere to fit you in.

36:29.437 --> 36:33.565
Down here might be better for
the private nature of our inquiry.

36:33.733 --> 36:36.151
Inquiry? Hmm.

36:36.694 --> 36:38.570
May I see some ID?

36:48.456 --> 36:49.956
This ain't a badge.

36:50.249 --> 36:53.168
No. It's not.

37:01.427 --> 37:03.178
Fucking slope cunt!

37:05.681 --> 37:07.974
We work for Mr. Rabbit.

37:12.355 --> 37:13.688
Sweet fuck.

37:13.981 --> 37:17.067
The guy you're looking for came
in a couple of days ago.

37:17.235 --> 37:19.736
- And what did he want?
- Just the usual, man.

37:19.904 --> 37:22.614
Credit cards, ID's.

37:22.782 --> 37:25.659
- Where is he now?
- I'll tell Mr. Rabbit whatever he wants...

37:25.826 --> 37:27.827
...but I've no idea.

37:30.748 --> 37:31.957
Okay, okay, okay!

37:32.124 --> 37:34.167
I'll get the file! It's in the safe.

37:39.131 --> 37:40.715
That would be helpful.

38:00.152 --> 38:01.528
Love me

38:01.696 --> 38:03.863
Love, love, love
Love me

38:04.031 --> 38:07.784
I'll be anything you want me
To be, baby

38:10.579 --> 38:11.830
Drive.

38:11.998 --> 38:14.207
So I pissed off some people
when I hired you.

38:14.375 --> 38:17.002
But every sheriff that we've had,
including Morgan...

38:17.169 --> 38:20.297
...ended up on Proctor's payroll,
so I needed an outsider.

38:21.966 --> 38:26.136
So you brought me in here to take down
this one guy? This Proctor?

38:26.304 --> 38:28.596
He's not just one guy, all right?

38:28.764 --> 38:32.767
There's not a criminal enterprise around here
that doesn't start or end in his pockets.

38:33.728 --> 38:36.896
Now, I know you don't work till Monday...

38:37.064 --> 38:39.441
...but I wanna show you the Cadi.

38:40.693 --> 38:41.693
The Cadi?

38:44.071 --> 38:46.656
The old Sheriff's Department
burned down three years ago.

38:46.824 --> 38:48.116
City Hall was pretty strapped.

38:48.284 --> 38:50.785
Froemer's Cadillac had just gone under,
so we got creative.

38:50.953 --> 38:52.912
Girl, you're gonna leave that man...

38:53.080 --> 38:55.248
...and you're gonna leave that man tonight.
- Mm-mm.

38:55.416 --> 38:56.583
Alma.

38:56.751 --> 38:59.169
Um, I'll call you later.

38:59.337 --> 39:00.754
Meet Lucas Hood.

39:00.921 --> 39:03.214
- Good to meet you, Alma.
- Sheriff Hood.

39:03.382 --> 39:05.091
Great to meet you.

39:06.761 --> 39:08.386
Mm-hm.

39:08.554 --> 39:12.140
- Afternoon, mayor.
- This is Lucas Hood.

39:14.393 --> 39:15.685
This is Emmett Yawners.

39:15.853 --> 39:18.104
He's one of the top 10 rushers
of all time at Penn State.

39:18.272 --> 39:20.231
- Good to meet you.
- Welcome to the B.S.D.

39:20.399 --> 39:23.651
This is Brock Lotus,
our longest-serving member of the department.

39:23.819 --> 39:26.696
- That right?
- How are you doing, sheriff?

39:26.864 --> 39:29.032
You fucking fascist!

39:29.200 --> 39:30.533
I didn't even do anything.

39:30.701 --> 39:33.036
Oh, yeah, you're a model citizen.

39:35.414 --> 39:38.416
You try and fight me again,
I remove your fucking testicles.

39:39.794 --> 39:41.044
- Hi.
- Hi.

39:41.212 --> 39:43.797
This is Lucas Hood. It's your new boss.

39:44.340 --> 39:47.801
Well, shit, Danny, you could have
said so sooner. I'm Siobhan Kelly.

39:47.968 --> 39:49.969
- My name's Peter.
- Shut the fuck up!

39:50.137 --> 39:52.806
I was thinking maybe you could show
the sheriff the town of Banshee.

39:52.973 --> 39:56.059
Oh, I'd love to, but, uh, I have to write up
Charlie Sheen here.

39:59.021 --> 40:01.022
Actually, uh, I'd love a tour...

40:01.190 --> 40:03.525
...from the longest-serving member
of the department.

40:05.319 --> 40:07.570
All right, so why don't we start
on the outskirts of town?

40:07.738 --> 40:10.156
There's an Indian casino.
Work our way back.

40:12.201 --> 40:16.538
Did I catch you on a bad day
or you always this cheerful?

40:16.705 --> 40:18.790
Aw, shit.

40:20.292 --> 40:21.709
What's going on?

40:22.253 --> 40:25.713
Moody boys build furniture and the Amish mills
have been driving down their prices.

40:25.881 --> 40:28.258
We've, uh... We've had incidents.

40:32.596 --> 40:33.805
They won't hit back.

40:33.973 --> 40:35.849
Oh, you've seen Witness.
Yeah, that's great.

40:36.016 --> 40:37.517
Why don't you let me handle this, huh?

40:37.685 --> 40:40.270
- Yeah, sure.
- Hood, Hood!

40:44.024 --> 40:45.483
Whoops!

40:48.028 --> 40:50.071
We don't work, you don't work.

40:50.239 --> 40:52.157
- The fuck up, punk.
- Hey!

40:54.910 --> 40:57.412
Why don't we all just take a moment...

40:57.580 --> 40:59.372
...talk about this?

40:59.540 --> 41:01.166
Who the fuck are you?

41:01.333 --> 41:04.502
Lucas Hood. I'm the new sheriff.

41:05.337 --> 41:08.756
Hey, Lotus, I thought you were supposed
to take over when Morgan kicked.

41:09.216 --> 41:11.259
Yeah, well, you and me both.

41:13.262 --> 41:16.181
Hey! Cole. That's enough.

41:17.141 --> 41:20.393
I'm sure your wife's got better things to do
than bail your ass out of jail today.

41:20.561 --> 41:24.147
- I'm not through messing with them.
- Yeah, you are.

41:24.315 --> 41:27.692
If you're the sheriff,
why aren't you in uniform?

41:27.860 --> 41:29.944
I don't start till Monday.

41:30.779 --> 41:34.282
So there's nothing stopping us
from fucking your shit up today, then, huh?

41:35.784 --> 41:37.952
Yeah. I hoped you'd make that connection.

41:38.120 --> 41:41.414
- All right, boys.
- Easy, deputy. I got this.

41:43.042 --> 41:44.834
So, come on, Cole...

41:46.921 --> 41:48.379
...fuck my shit up.

41:50.799 --> 41:54.469
All right, just to be clear,
we'll be pounding a civilian...

41:58.599 --> 41:59.807
Come on, motherfucker. Get up!

42:04.772 --> 42:07.607
Get his ass, Cole. Get his ass!

42:10.819 --> 42:12.195
That's enough, Cole.

42:12.363 --> 42:13.696
Mr. Proctor.

42:18.077 --> 42:20.078
Your four-on-one advantage
wasn't enough?

42:21.539 --> 42:23.164
You needed this?

42:28.170 --> 42:29.796
Come on, guys.

42:31.006 --> 42:32.590
Hold on.

42:33.092 --> 42:34.759
These men are on a schedule.

42:34.927 --> 42:38.179
Why don't you boys help them
load their wagons?

42:38.722 --> 42:40.848
Yes, sir. Come on.

42:48.232 --> 42:50.275
You are?

42:52.611 --> 42:56.030
- Lucas Hood.
- The new sheriff.

42:57.533 --> 43:00.827
Fucking Dutchie. This isn't over.

43:07.876 --> 43:09.627
Kai Proctor.

43:09.795 --> 43:12.422
Sorry if I stepped on your toes there.

43:12.590 --> 43:16.259
- Mr. Proctor, what exactly do you do?
- I'm in meats.

43:19.722 --> 43:22.765
Why don't you stop by
the slaughterhouse?

43:22.933 --> 43:25.393
I'll set you up with some nice steaks.

43:46.582 --> 43:48.958
Father...

43:50.878 --> 43:53.129
...it's good to see you.

44:07.144 --> 44:09.729
Hey, Lotus, I'm gonna walk.

44:16.403 --> 44:18.488
You're welcome, by the way.

45:01.949 --> 45:03.032
I have to go.

45:03.200 --> 45:05.076
Come on, stay with me.

45:05.369 --> 45:07.537
- See you later.
- What?

45:11.083 --> 45:12.709
But I love you.

45:14.962 --> 45:16.587
- Whoa! You okay?
- Yeah, my bad.

45:16.755 --> 45:19.048
Okay. It's all right.

45:23.929 --> 45:26.472
Thirteen years old, my ass.

45:26.640 --> 45:29.350
Hey. Sorry, you dropped this.

45:30.394 --> 45:32.812
- Thanks.
- Shouldn't you be in school?

45:32.980 --> 45:34.897
Yeah, I should.

45:35.190 --> 45:37.358
Can't your boyfriend take you back?

45:37.818 --> 45:39.402
Who says he's my boyfriend?

45:39.570 --> 45:41.571
Well, I hope he's not your brother.

46:18.484 --> 46:20.359
P&Ls.

46:20.652 --> 46:22.820
Our numbers are down
at both strip clubs?

46:23.155 --> 46:25.782
With the economy what it is...

46:26.700 --> 46:29.410
Men will pay for tits
until they're broke or dead.

46:29.578 --> 46:30.703
Fix that, Burton.

46:42.216 --> 46:44.217
You said you wanted to see me?

46:46.845 --> 46:48.805
It's a relatively humane procedure.

46:49.890 --> 46:52.809
We stun the beasts
with a pneumatic captive bolt gun...

46:52.976 --> 46:54.602
One of these.

46:54.978 --> 46:57.355
One bolt to the brain does the trick.

46:57.773 --> 47:01.400
Then we cut them
and they quietly bleed out.

47:02.027 --> 47:04.612
- Listen, um...
- The Old Order Pennsylvania Dutch...

47:04.780 --> 47:06.572
...don't like being called "Dutchies."

47:06.740 --> 47:07.949
It's derisive.

47:08.116 --> 47:11.953
I believe I heard you call my father
a "fucking Dutchie."

47:13.872 --> 47:15.873
I was just running my mouth.

47:16.041 --> 47:18.501
I didn't know he was your father.

47:34.601 --> 47:36.894
Now you take your teeth
and put them back...

47:37.062 --> 47:39.397
...in your fat, bigoted mouth
and get the fuck out of here.

47:40.065 --> 47:42.108
Back in your mouth, I said.

47:52.452 --> 47:54.787
Why don't you see Mr. Moody out?

48:12.055 --> 48:13.097
You.

49:18.038 --> 49:20.206
- They get your size wrong?
- No, I'm good.

49:23.961 --> 49:27.338
Bring the pants to the Martinizing
over by the diner. They'll take them in for you.

49:27.506 --> 49:29.632
All right, thanks. I'll do that.

49:30.425 --> 49:33.844
Ha, ha. You got any family
coming to the swearing in?

49:34.012 --> 49:37.014
No, I don't have any family...

49:37.641 --> 49:39.266
...coming or not.

49:41.228 --> 49:43.229
Well, we'll all be there...

49:43.522 --> 49:45.439
...and at Proctor's reception after.

49:45.607 --> 49:46.816
Reception?

49:47.401 --> 49:51.070
Say what you will about Proctor,
but the man knows how to throw a party.

49:53.073 --> 49:55.700
There. Now that's what a sheriff looks like.

50:09.715 --> 50:12.299
- I do solemnly swear...
- I do solemnly swear...

50:12.467 --> 50:15.177
...that I will support, protect, and defend...

50:15.345 --> 50:18.055
...that I will support, protect, and defend...

50:18.223 --> 50:21.434
The Constitution
and government of the United States...

50:21.601 --> 50:24.103
The Constitution and government
of the United States...

50:24.271 --> 50:27.606
...and of the State of Pennsylvania...

50:27.774 --> 50:30.192
That I have no knowledge
of any circumstance...

50:30.360 --> 50:32.820
That I have no knowledge
of any circumstance...

50:32.988 --> 50:35.448
- Past or present...
- Past or present...

50:35.615 --> 50:38.451
That would disqualify me
from the assignment of this office...

50:38.618 --> 50:41.412
That would disqualify me from
the assignment of this office...

50:41.580 --> 50:44.623
- That I have neither given...
- That I have neither given...

50:44.791 --> 50:48.419
Nor will give any person
any gratuity, gift, fee, or reward...

50:48.587 --> 50:51.338
...in consideration of support for this office...

50:51.506 --> 50:55.593
Nor will give any person
any gratuity, gift, fee, or reward...

50:55.761 --> 50:59.055
...in consideration of support
for this office...

50:59.222 --> 51:02.141
...that I am duly qualified to hold office...

51:02.309 --> 51:04.477
...that I am duly qualified to hold office...

51:04.644 --> 51:08.439
- Under the Constitution of the state...
- Under the Constitution of the state...

51:08.607 --> 51:11.108
...and that I will well and faithfully perform...

51:11.276 --> 51:13.277
...and that I will well and faithfully perform...

51:13.445 --> 51:15.529
...the duties of Banshee County Sheriff...

51:15.697 --> 51:17.364
...the duties of Banshee County Sheriff...

51:17.532 --> 51:19.241
...the office of which I now enter...

51:19.409 --> 51:21.035
...the office of which I now enter...

51:21.203 --> 51:24.121
...so help me God.

51:34.049 --> 51:35.800
Understated as usual.

51:35.967 --> 51:38.094
You just charged the man
with racketeering.

51:38.261 --> 51:41.388
Now you're at his party.
Only in Banshee.

51:59.407 --> 52:00.825
Sheriff Hood.

52:01.743 --> 52:03.160
Mr. Proctor.

52:03.995 --> 52:05.287
This is some shindig.

52:05.455 --> 52:07.915
You'll find that Banshee
is not the backwater town...

52:08.083 --> 52:10.376
...it sometimes pretends to be.

52:11.753 --> 52:13.379
You enjoy yourself.

52:14.631 --> 52:16.465
I'll check in on you soon.

52:17.509 --> 52:18.801
Sure.

52:19.261 --> 52:22.304
Sheriff Hood. Gordon Hopewell.

52:22.472 --> 52:25.850
- We met at the swearing in.
- The DA, right?

52:26.017 --> 52:29.270
Honey, come over
and meet our new sheriff.

52:30.689 --> 52:32.148
Hi.

52:34.442 --> 52:36.694
Lucas Hood. Great to meet you.

52:39.322 --> 52:41.073
Carrie?

52:41.241 --> 52:43.117
I'm sorry. I'm not myself tonight.

52:43.285 --> 52:45.452
No? Who are you, then?

52:49.374 --> 52:51.333
Good to meet you, Mrs. Hopewell.

52:55.672 --> 52:57.882
I'm telling you,
there's something wrong with that guy.

52:58.049 --> 53:01.260
He went through the Moody boys
like they were cardboard.

53:01.428 --> 53:05.139
So you're upset that our sheriff
knows how to fight?

53:05.307 --> 53:06.974
It wasn't just fighting, Emmett.

53:07.434 --> 53:08.976
It was fucking combat.

53:09.978 --> 53:11.562
Sheriff Hood...

53:12.022 --> 53:14.398
...I'd like you to meet
Chief Benjamin Longshadow...

53:14.566 --> 53:16.233
...of the local Kinaho Tribe...

53:16.401 --> 53:19.236
...a good friend and a great man
revered in Banshee.

53:19.404 --> 53:22.781
- Good to meet you, chief.
- Likewise, Sheriff Hood.

53:22.949 --> 53:25.242
My son Alex.

53:25.410 --> 53:26.744
- Hi.
- Hey, Alex.

53:26.912 --> 53:30.706
When you get settled, my tribal council...

53:30.874 --> 53:33.250
...wants to honor you with a dinner.

53:33.418 --> 53:35.419
On the reservation, of course.

53:35.587 --> 53:38.297
Yeah, um, that sounds great.

53:38.465 --> 53:40.507
Uh, you'll... You'll excuse me?

54:00.070 --> 54:01.862
A sheriff?

54:02.030 --> 54:03.948
Are you kidding me?

54:05.283 --> 54:07.534
They have a great health plan.

54:07.702 --> 54:10.204
You're not gonna need it in prison.

54:11.873 --> 54:14.208
You used to have more faith in me.

54:20.340 --> 54:24.051
- Why are you doing this?
- You know why.

54:31.476 --> 54:33.269
Come here for a sec.

54:40.735 --> 54:43.279
- I don't believe this.
- It's an old Sargent safe.

54:43.446 --> 54:46.115
I can't get in there,
but you could do it in your sleep.

54:46.283 --> 54:48.534
- Jesus.
- Come on, it's the least you can do.

54:48.702 --> 54:50.202
No.

54:50.370 --> 54:52.705
What you're doing is crazy.
If you don't end it, I will.

54:52.872 --> 54:57.876
Yeah? You're in no position
to blow any whistles, Mrs. Hopewell.

54:58.837 --> 55:00.087
You're insane.

55:17.689 --> 55:19.315
Honey...

55:20.317 --> 55:21.900
...I'm feeling pretty tired.

55:22.068 --> 55:25.112
You're preaching to the choir.
I think we've stayed long enough.

55:29.075 --> 55:31.243
Kai, thanks for having us.

55:31.870 --> 55:33.120
Sure.

55:33.288 --> 55:35.205
Glad you stopped by.

55:35.373 --> 55:37.249
This isn't awkward at all.

55:39.586 --> 55:43.047
- Oh, my God!
- Proctor!

55:45.592 --> 55:47.384
- Get out of here.
- Just stay there.

55:50.305 --> 55:52.056
Get down, get down.

55:54.184 --> 55:56.518
- Please.
- Dutchie motherfucker!

56:34.933 --> 56:37.059
Taxi!

57:02.627 --> 57:04.503
Knight to rook four.

57:07.298 --> 57:08.298
Yours.

57:11.177 --> 57:13.262
Pishak to queen three.

57:14.389 --> 57:15.931
Yours.

57:19.394 --> 57:23.397
So, no documents...

57:24.274 --> 57:26.525
...no software, no hardware.

57:27.861 --> 57:32.364
Everything in this hairdresser's, burned?

57:32.532 --> 57:33.991
Yes.

57:36.369 --> 57:39.163
Queen to knight two. Checkmate.

57:51.634 --> 57:54.428
You will find them both...

57:54.596 --> 57:56.096
...quickly.
