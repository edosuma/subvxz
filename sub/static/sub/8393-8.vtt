- OH, MY GOD.

15:35.650 --> 15:36.856
- BUT I HANDLED IT.

15:36.970 --> 15:38.995
WE HAD A GREAT TALK.

15:39.110 --> 15:41.305
AND, YOU KNOW, I TALKED
TO HIM ABOUT CONDOMS

15:41.420 --> 15:42.648
AND BEING RESPONSIBLE--
- YEAH, NO, NO, NO.

15:42.760 --> 15:43.829
THANKS.
HE KNOWS ALL THAT.

15:43.940 --> 15:45.589
- I KNOW, BUT I--
- THIS IS MORE AN ISSUE

15:45.700 --> 15:47.839
OF YOU CAN'T--YOU KNOW,
HE CAN'T JUST BE DOING THAT

15:47.940 --> 15:49.214
IN THE HOUSE, I MEAN--
- WELL, YEAH.

15:49.320 --> 15:50.389
- WHAT ARE THE GROUND RULES,
RIGHT?

15:50.500 --> 15:51.808
WE'RE NOT, LIKE,
RUNNING A BROTHEL HERE.

15:51.910 --> 15:53.457
NOW HE'S GOING OVER
TO HER HOUSE.

15:53.570 --> 15:55.151
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
IF THERE'S PARENTS THERE.

15:55.260 --> 15:56.568
- I WAS DISCOURAGING,
BUT, WAIT, BEFORE YOU CALL HIM

15:56.670 --> 15:57.910
OR ANYTHING,
UM, OKAY,

15:58.020 --> 16:01.956
I-I-I KNOW HE'S YOUR SON,
AND, UM,

16:02.060 --> 16:04.506
BUT I'VE BEEN TRYING
TO ALSO SORT OF TRANSITION

16:04.610 --> 16:06.168
FROM BEING HIS TEACHER
TO HIS PARENT-LIKE FIGURE...

16:06.270 --> 16:10.309
- OF COURSE.
- AND HE ASKED ME

16:10.410 --> 16:12.583
NOT TO TELL YOU, AND I TOLD HIM
THAT I WOULDN'T.

16:12.690 --> 16:14.726
- MARK.
- I KNOW.

16:14.830 --> 16:15.899
I'M HIS MOTHER.
- I KNOW. THAT'S WHY I TOLD YOU.

16:16.000 --> 16:17.558
- THIS IS A MAJOR ISSUE.

16:17.660 --> 16:20.481
- I KNOW, AND THAT'S WHY
I JUST TOLD YOU.

16:20.600 --> 16:23.114
BUT I LITERALLY PROMISED HIM
THIS MORNING,

16:23.220 --> 16:26.804
AND, IF HE FINDS OUT
THAT I JUST TURNED AROUND

16:26.910 --> 16:27.899
AND TOLD YOU,
THIS IS THE FIRST TIME

16:28.020 --> 16:28.975
HE CONFIDED IN ME.
- I UNDERSTAND,

16:29.090 --> 16:30.398
BUT WHY MAKE HIM
THAT KIND OF PROMISE?

16:30.500 --> 16:31.728
I GET IT.
- I THINK IT'S FINE.

16:31.850 --> 16:33.670
HE'S BEING RESPONSIBLE,
AND WE HAD THIS TALK,

16:33.780 --> 16:36.499
AND, IF YOU JUST TRUST ME

16:36.610 --> 16:38.646
WITH THIS ONE,

16:38.750 --> 16:39.330
I WOULD GREATLY APPRECIATE IT.

16:39.440 --> 16:43.160
- OKAY.

16:43.270 --> 16:45.158
- OKAY.
THANK YOU.

16:49.930 --> 16:51.625
- WHERE YOU GOING?

16:51.730 --> 16:53.004
- I'M RUNNING AWAY.

16:53.110 --> 16:56.409
YOU CAN'T STOP ME.
[door opens]

16:56.530 --> 16:58.998
- HEY.

16:59.120 --> 17:00.974
- WHERE ARE YOU GOING,
SWEETIE?

17:01.080 --> 17:03.594
- MOLLY'S HOUSE.
- MOLLY'S HOUSE.

17:03.710 --> 17:05.564
- OH, HOW YOU GETTING THERE?
- I'M TAKING A TAXI.

17:05.670 --> 17:09.219
- OKAY, MAYBE I'M NOT SURE
THERE'S TAXIS OUT THIS LATE.

17:09.330 --> 17:10.262
- AND YOU NEED MONEY
FOR A TAXI.

17:10.370 --> 17:12.531
- YUP.
- I HAVE PIGGY BANK MONEY.

17:13.890 --> 17:15.926
STOP IT.
IT'S NOT FUNNY.

17:16.030 --> 17:17.474
YOU GUYS ARE SO MEAN.

17:17.580 --> 17:18.854
- NO, SWEETIE.
- WE'RE NOT LAUGHING.

17:18.960 --> 17:20.279
COME ON.
- HEY, HEY.

17:20.380 --> 17:24.931
- SYDNEY, COME BACK HERE.

17:25.040 --> 17:27.691
- YOU SAID
AFTER THE BASEBALL GAME,

17:27.800 --> 17:29.244
VICTOR TIME WOULD BE OVER,

17:29.350 --> 17:30.453
IT WOULD BE MY TIME.

17:30.560 --> 17:32.972
WE WERE SUPPOSED
TO GO SKATING.

17:33.080 --> 17:34.900
YOU SAID
YOU WERE QUITTING YOUR JOB

17:35.010 --> 17:36.978
SO YOU CAN SPEND MORE TIME
WITH US, NO.

17:37.090 --> 17:38.899
WHAT YOU REALLY MEANT
IS YOU WANT

17:39.020 --> 17:40.840
TO SPEND MORE TIME
WITH VICTOR.

17:40.950 --> 17:42.497
- OH, SWEETIE,
THAT'S NOT TRUE.

17:42.610 --> 17:43.816
- YES, IT IS.

17:43.920 --> 17:46.536
YOU WENT TO HIS BASEBALL GAME
INSTEAD OF MY RECITAL.

17:46.650 --> 17:50.336
YOU LET HIM DO
ANYTHING HE WANTS.

17:50.440 --> 17:53.477
AND, IN CASE YOU FORGOT,
I WAS HERE FIRST.

17:53.580 --> 17:55.821
- SYD.

18:02.180 --> 18:03.488
SYDNEY.

18:05.980 --> 18:08.039
- YOU GUYS REMEMBER THAT TIME

18:08.150 --> 18:09.560
WE'RE ALL IN THE BARRACKS,

18:09.670 --> 18:10.898
WE ALL GOT EVAN DOWN,

18:11.020 --> 18:12.009
AND WE PANTSED HIM?

18:12.120 --> 18:13.109
HE HAD TO RUN OUT--
- OH, NO.

18:13.230 --> 18:15.607
- TELL ABOUT THE ICE CREAM.
- YEAH.

18:15.710 --> 18:16.847
_ 50--
- EW, WHAT'S THE ICE CREAM?

18:16.950 --> 18:19.464
THAT CAN'T END WELL.

18:19.580 --> 18:22.606
- WE HAD ACQUIRED
SOME ICE CREAM SOMEHOW,

18:22.720 --> 18:24.267
AND WE DECIDED
THAT IT WOULD BE GOOD

18:24.370 --> 18:27.715
TO STORE THE ICE CREAM
IN HIS UNDERGARMENTS

18:27.830 --> 18:30.025
ON HIS PERSON.

18:30.140 --> 18:31.300
- RYAN!

18:31.420 --> 18:34.628
- AND TIE HIM
WITH HIS HANDS

18:34.730 --> 18:35.515
BEHIND HIS BACK.

18:35.630 --> 18:37.348
THERE WAS
A POST THING OUTSIDE.

18:37.460 --> 18:38.449
WE KIND OF ENCOURAGED
THE DOGS.

18:38.560 --> 18:43.111
- EW!
- TO SNACK ON HIS ICE CREAM.

18:43.220 --> 18:46.189
[laughter]
- THAT'S AWFUL.

18:46.290 --> 18:48.042
YOU GET BORED.

18:48.160 --> 18:49.843
- GLASSES UP.
GLASSES UP.

18:49.950 --> 18:52.009
GLASSES UP.

18:52.130 --> 18:54.746
HERE'S TO PRIVATE FIRST CLASS
EVAN WILSON.

18:54.850 --> 18:57.159
HE WAS A GOOD SOLDIER.

18:59.790 --> 19:02.918
HE WAS OUR BROTHER.

19:03.900 --> 19:07.449
HE DIED A HERO.

19:09.970 --> 19:12.905
- AMEN. THANKS.

19:15.010 --> 19:17.570
- I'M SORRY.

19:17.670 --> 19:20.047
ARE WE TALKING
ABOUT THE SAME DEAD GUY?

19:20.150 --> 19:21.321
BECAUSE NO BROTHER OF MINE
WOULD HAVE CHOSEN

19:21.430 --> 19:22.840
TO LEAVE THIS WORLD.

19:22.950 --> 19:24.110
MIKEY HERE HAS ONE
VERY GOOD REASON TO COMPLAIN.

19:24.230 --> 19:25.436
WHAT'D EVEN HAVE
TO COMPLAIN ABOUT?

19:25.540 --> 19:28.191
HE CAME BACK IN ONE PIECE.
- ALL RIGHT, AUSTIN.

19:28.300 --> 19:29.335
WE'VE ALL HAD A FEW POPS.
SETTLE DOWN.

19:29.440 --> 19:31.886
- DON'T TELL ME TO SETTLE DOWN.
- HUGHES.

19:31.990 --> 19:33.469
SHOW SOME RESPECT.

19:33.580 --> 19:35.093
- IS ANYONE REALLY SURPRISED

19:35.200 --> 19:36.235
HE TOOK
THE COWARD'S WAY OUT?

19:36.340 --> 19:37.750
- WHAT IS THIS GUY'S DEAL?

19:37.860 --> 19:38.713
- HE'S AN IDIOT.

19:38.830 --> 19:40.752
- I'M JUST SAYING
WHAT WE'RE ALL THINKING.

19:40.860 --> 19:42.657
THIS IS BULL.

19:42.760 --> 19:44.512
AND YOU ALL KNOW IT.

19:44.630 --> 19:46.109
- RYAN.

19:46.210 --> 19:48.838
- SETTLE DOWN.
SETTLE DOWN.

19:48.940 --> 19:52.694
YORK.
YORK.

19:56.980 --> 20:00.609
- I'M TURNING IN.
LET'S GO.

20:01.750 --> 20:04.503
- HEY.

20:09.930 --> 20:12.899
[ragged breathing]

20:21.870 --> 20:26.455
- HEY.
- HEY.

20:26.570 --> 20:29.664
- I JUST BROUGHT YOU
SOME FRESH WATER.

20:29.780 --> 20:31.224
YOU OKAY?

20:31.330 --> 20:33.946
- IT HURTS.

20:34.060 --> 20:35.129
HOW ARE THE KIDS?

20:35.230 --> 20:36.390
- THEY'RE FINE.

20:36.510 --> 20:39.673
- YEAH, I'M NOT SLEEPING
DOWNSTAIRS ANYMORE.

20:39.790 --> 20:41.405
- OH.
- DAD, I'M NOT GONNA SLEEP

20:41.510 --> 20:42.670
DOWNSTAIRS ANYMORE.
MICAH'S BEING ANNOYING.

20:42.790 --> 20:44.234
- MAX, SHH, YOUR MOTHER'S
NOT FEELING WELL.

20:44.340 --> 20:45.409
IN THE HALLWAY.
- WHY IS SHE NOT FEELING WELL?

20:45.520 --> 20:48.023
IS IT BECAUSE SHYEég DOING CHEMO?

20:48.140 --> 20:50.347
LISTEN, COME HERE.

20:50.450 --> 20:52.270
- WHAT?
- YOU'RE SLEEPING DOWNSTAIRS.

20:52.380 --> 20:53.938
THAT WAS THE WHOLE POINT
OF THE FORT, MAX.

20:54.040 --> 20:55.177
- NO, MICAH'S BEING ANNOYING,
AND NOW I WANT

20:55.280 --> 20:56.520
TO SLEEP UPSTAIRS ALONE
IN MY BED.

20:56.630 --> 20:58.109
- I WANT YOU TO SLEEP DOWN--
- I'M SLEEPING IN MY BED.

20:58.220 --> 21:00.074
- MR. BRAVERMAN!

21:00.180 --> 21:01.317
- YEAH.
- I'M SCARED OF THE DARK.

21:01.430 --> 21:03.182
- MICAH NEEDS HELP DOWNSTAIRS.

21:03.290 --> 21:04.632
- YEAH, I KNOW, MAX.
[door closes]

21:04.740 --> 21:06.287
ALL RIGHT.

21:06.400 --> 21:09.221
YOU GONNA BE ABLE
TO SLEEP DOWN THERE?

21:09.330 --> 21:10.433
- YEAH.
- SORRY THE FORT

21:10.540 --> 21:11.359
DIDN'T WORK OUT, BUD.
- IT'S OKAY.

21:11.470 --> 21:13.119
- ALL RIGHT. GOOD NIGHT.
- NIGHT.

21:13.230 --> 21:16.233
- GOOD NIGHT, MAX.
- YUP.

21:16.340 --> 21:17.432
- OH, I NEED THAT ON.

21:17.550 --> 21:19.541
CAN YOU LEAVE THE LIGHT ON,
PLEASE?

21:19.650 --> 21:21.470
- NO. NO, YOU DON'T.
I CAN'T SLEEP WITH THE LIGHT ON.

21:21.590 --> 21:22.966
- BUT I CAN'T SLEEP
WITH ONE OFF.

21:23.070 --> 21:24.651
- NO, I CAN'T HAVE IT ON.

21:24.760 --> 21:25.613
I CAN'T SLEEP
WITH THE LIGHTS ON.

21:25.730 --> 21:27.174
THAT'S RIDICULOUS.
- OKAY.

21:27.280 --> 21:28.349
GUYS, GUYS, TELL YOU
WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO.

21:28.450 --> 21:30.623
WE'RE GONNA COMPROMISE,
OKAY?

21:30.730 --> 21:33.449
I'M GONNA TURN THAT LIGHT OFF,
LEAVE THE HALL LIGHT ON.

21:33.560 --> 21:35.209
I'M GONNA LEAVE THE DOOR
SLIGHTLY OPEN.

21:35.320 --> 21:36.070
OKAY?
- WE'LL SEE.

21:36.190 --> 21:39.569
- MR. BRAVERMAN?
- [SlghS]

21:39.670 --> 21:42.252
YEAH.
- I HAVE TO GO TO THE BATHROOM.

21:42.370 --> 21:44.326
- JUST GO TO SLEEP ALREADY.

21:44.440 --> 21:46.647
YOUR BLADDER IS THE SIZE
OF A WALNUT.

21:46.750 --> 21:48.297
- MAX.
- YOUR BRAIN IS A WALNUT.

21:48.410 --> 21:50.549
- NO, IT ISN'T.
THAT'S JUST NOT TRUE.

21:50.650 --> 21:51.548
- YES, IT IS.
- MY BRAIN IS A BRAIN.

22:00.280 --> 22:02.555
- WHAT'S UP, RYAN?
- WHAT IS UP, HUGHES?

22:02.660 --> 22:03.388
- I DON'T KNOW, MAN.

22:03.490 --> 22:04.969
WHY DON'T YOU TELL ME?

22:05.080 --> 22:06.627
TRYING TO BE SOME KIND
OF TOUGH GUY OUT HERE

22:06.730 --> 22:07.833
IN FRONT OF YOUR GIRLFRIEND
TONIGHT?

22:07.940 --> 22:09.282
- YOU NEED TO QUIT
RUNNING YOUR MOUTH.

22:09.390 --> 22:11.210
- OR ELSE WHAT?
THIS WHOLE THING IS A JOKE.

22:11.330 --> 22:12.456
IT WASN'T EVEN LINE OF DUTY.

22:12.570 --> 22:13.730
HE'S GETTING FULL HONORS?
- SHUT UP.

22:13.840 --> 22:15.250
- OH, 'CAUSE HE COULDN'T DEAL

22:15.360 --> 22:17.248
LIKE A MAN?
IS THAT WHAT'S UP?

22:17.370 --> 22:18.814
- SHUT YOUR MOUTH.
YOU HEAR ME?

22:18.920 --> 22:20.126
- GET OFF ME.

22:20.230 --> 22:22.676
[grunts]
GET OFF OF ME.

22:23.920 --> 22:27.401
[grunting]

22:31.970 --> 22:33.540
- HEY, RYAN!

22:33.660 --> 22:35.628
RYAN, GET OFF HIM.

22:35.730 --> 22:37.209
- HE WASN'T A COWARD!
YOU HEAR ME?

22:37.320 --> 22:38.036
- RYAN!
- HE WASN'T A COWARD!

22:38.140 --> 22:39.209
YOU HEAR ME?
- STOP!

22:39.320 --> 22:41.208
- GET OFF OF HIM.
- GET OFF OF ME!

22:41.320 --> 22:44.380
- RYAN! STOP!

22:44.500 --> 22:46.707
OH, MY GOD.

22:46.810 --> 22:50.394
WHAT HAPPENED?
- IS HE ALL RIGHT?

22:50.500 --> 22:52.365
- ARE YOU OKAY?

22:52.470 --> 22:55.155
- [sobbing]
- ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

23:01.930 --> 23:04.478
[footsteps]

23:04.590 --> 23:05.784
- YOU KNOW,
I'VE BEEN THINKING,

23:05.900 --> 23:07.470
WE SHOULD DO SOMETHING SPECIAL
WITH SYD TODAY.

23:07.590 --> 23:08.864
- YEAH, LIKE WHAT?

23:08.970 --> 23:11.131
- I DON'T KNOW.
GOLDEN GATE PARK OR CABLE CARS.

23:11.250 --> 23:13.696
ICE SKATING.
- WOW.

23:13.800 --> 23:15.529
YOU THINK VICTOR WILL BE
INTO THAT?

23:15.630 --> 23:18.007
- OH, I WAS THINKING
WE COULD DROP VICTOR OFF

23:18.120 --> 23:19.348
AT YOUR PARENTS' HOUSE

23:19.460 --> 23:22.975
AND JUST GO THE THREE OF US.

23:23.090 --> 23:24.159
- HER TANTRUM WORKED ON YOU.

23:24.260 --> 23:25.488
- NO, HER TANTRUM DIDN'T--

23:25.610 --> 23:27.703
- NO, WE CAN'T REWARD HER
FOR ACTING OUT.

23:27.820 --> 23:28.320
THAT'D BE SENDING
THE WRONG MESSAGE.

23:28.440 --> 23:29.816
- WELL, SHE MAKES

23:29.920 --> 23:31.399
SOME DAMN GOOD POINTS, HONEY.

23:31.510 --> 23:34.092
I MEAN, MAYBE SHE DESERVES
A LITTLE REWARD HERE.

23:34.200 --> 23:36.543
WE'VE BEEN SPENDING SO MUCH TIME
FOCUSING ON VICTOR,

23:36.650 --> 23:38.231
AND YOU KNOW I LOVE
WHAT YOU'VE BEEN DOING

23:38.340 --> 23:42.754
TO HELP OUR BOY,
BUT, MAN, MAYBE--

23:42.860 --> 23:45.511
MAYBE SYD'S ACTING OUT
BECAUSE SHE HAS BEEN GETTING

23:45.630 --> 23:47.586
THE SHORT END
OF THE STICK.

23:51.050 --> 23:52.074
- SO I PROMISED
I WOULDN'T SAY ANYTHING,

23:52.180 --> 23:53.659
AND NOW,
IF YOU CAN BELIEVE IT,

23:53.770 --> 23:55.761
I CAN'T SAY ANYTHING.

23:55.880 --> 23:58.087
- HOW DO I GET
THAT SAME ARRANGEMENT OVER HERE?

23:58.190 --> 23:59.259
- HA HA.

23:59.360 --> 24:00.349
- LIKE, WHAT'S THE RATE?

24:00.470 --> 24:01.391
WHAT'S THE ANNUAL RATE ON THAT?

24:01.500 --> 24:03.673
- DON'T YOU THINK IT'S ODD

24:03.780 --> 24:06.226
THAT I'M NOT ALLOWED TO KNOW

24:06.340 --> 24:08.740
AN ENTIRE PORTION
OF MY KID'S LIFE?

24:08.860 --> 24:10.612
- I THINK IT'S WEIRD
THAT YOU WANT TO KNOW ABOUT IT.

24:10.720 --> 24:11.994
- I DON'T WANT
TO TALK ABOUT THE DETAILS,

24:12.100 --> 24:12.782
BUT IT'S A LIFE MOMENT.

24:12.890 --> 24:14.585
IT'S SOMETHING TO ACKNOWLEDGE

24:14.690 --> 24:16.999
THAT NORMALLY I WOULD BE ABLE
TO DISCUSS--

24:17.110 --> 24:18.236
- HOW MUCH DID WE SPEND
ON THE ROSENTHAL BAR MITZVAH?

24:18.350 --> 24:19.794

24:19.900 --> 24:21.936
- THEN WHY ARE WE STILL TALKING
ABOUT YOUR SON'S SEX LIFE?

24:22.040 --> 24:23.246

ABOUT MY SON'S SEX LIFE.

24:23.350 --> 24:24.487
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT MY LIFE

24:24.600 --> 24:26.761
AND THE FACT
THAT I HAVE BEEN SHUT OUT

24:26.870 --> 24:28.519
OF AN AREA OF HIS LIFE.

24:28.630 --> 24:30.450
- ALL RIGHT, LOOK,
HERE'S WHAT I TELL MY DAUGHTER.

24:30.570 --> 24:32.219
THERE'S NO SECRETS
IN PARENTING.

24:32.330 --> 24:33.877
SHE TELLS ME SOMETHING,

24:33.980 --> 24:36.460
THEN SHE CAN ASSUME
HER MOTHER HAS THE SAME INFO

24:36.570 --> 24:37.707
AND VICE VERSA.

24:37.820 --> 24:38.980
- THAT'S VERY HELPFUL.
DOES THAT WORK?

24:39.090 --> 24:41.979
- YEAH, WHEN MY EX
ISN'T LYING TO ME.

24:42.100 --> 24:45.092

I DIDN'T SAY THAT.

25:09.850 --> 25:10.805

32:14.070 --> 32:15.446
WHEN SHE BROKE UP WITH YOU,
AND I JUST WANT YOU

32:15.550 --> 32:18.656

AND, YOU KNOW, REALLY--

32:18.760 --> 32:20.409

32:20.520 --> 32:21.896
YOU WEREN'T COT-INNA TELL HER.

I'M SORRY.
WE CAN'T HAVE SECRETS

32:24.110 --> 32:25.554

OKAY?

32:25.660 --> 32:27.104
I'M YOUR MOM, AND--
- HE'S NOT MY PARENT.

32:27.220 --> 32:29.791
LIKE, IT'S DIFFERENT.
- WELL, THAT'S A WHOLE--

32:29.910 --> 32:31.946
YOU CAN'T ASK HIM
TO KEEP SECRETS LIKE THAT

32:32.050 --> 32:33.358
FROM ME, DREW.
- YEAH, BUT HE'S NOT MY PARENT.

32:33.460 --> 32:34.734
- IF YOU'RE GONNA BE WITH A GIRL
HERE IN THIS HOUSE--

32:34.840 --> 32:36.467
I KNOW,
BUT I AM YOUR PARENT,

32:36.570 --> 32:38.151

- WELL, ASK HIM
WHAT'S GOING ON.

32:42.990 --> 32:47.051
ALL RIGHT?
HE KNOWS EVERYTHING.

32:49.550 --> 32:51.131
[door closes]
- IT JUST CAME OUT.

32:51.240 --> 32:54.858
- I THOUGHT WE AGREED
THAT I WAS HANDLING THIS.

32:54.970 --> 32:55.789
- I KNOW.
I JUST--I WAS ONLY ASKING HIM--

32:55.900 --> 32:57.174
I DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING.

32:57.280 --> 32:59.316
- YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO.
HE COULD--

32:59.420 --> 33:01.650
ALL RIGHT.

33:04.010 --> 33:05.181
[door closes]

33:05.290 --> 33:07.178
- EVERYBODY HATED
JAR JAR BINKS.

33:07.290 --> 33:09.178
THAT'S WHY HE WAS BANNED
FROM NABOO.

33:09.290 --> 33:10.564
- NO, THAT'S NOT TRUE.

33:10.670 --> 33:12.012
HE WAS THE FIRST GUNGAN
TO REPRESENT HIS PEOPLE

33:12.120 --> 33:13.155
IN THE GALACTIC SENATE.

33:13.260 --> 33:15.125
HE SAVED EVERYONE
FROM THE DROID ARMY.

33:15.230 --> 33:16.049
- HEY, HEY, MAX.
NO, NO, NO.

33:16.160 --> 33:17.263
PLEASE DON'T USE YOUR FINGERS.

33:17.370 --> 33:19.019
THERE'S A SPOON RIGHT THERE
AND A PLATE.

33:19.130 --> 33:19.812
- OH, NO.
NO, DON'T WORRY.

33:19.920 --> 33:21.615
WE'RE FINE LIKE THIS.

33:21.720 --> 33:22.926
- NO, NO, DON'T FEED--

33:23.030 --> 33:24.577
- BUT THE BEST PART
ABOUT THAT WAS--

33:24.690 --> 33:26.066
- I'M FINE WITHOUT A PLATE.
DON'T WORRY.

33:26.170 --> 33:28.513
THIS IS GREAT. OH, CAN YOU
GET ME SOME TIRAMISU?

33:28.620 --> 33:30.133
- SORRY FOR BARGING IN
ON YOUR PARTY.

33:30.240 --> 33:31.377
I JUST DIDN'T KNOW
WHAT ELSE TO DO.

33:31.490 --> 33:32.104
- LOOK, WELL,
I AM A LITTLE OFFENDED

33:32.210 --> 33:33.962
