00:24.348 --> 00:26.550

00:33.792 --> 00:36.459

KENNETH: There was hit-and-run

00:51.805 --> 00:53.436
February 10, 2007.

You took my whole life away.

01:00.879 --> 01:02.980

05:24.259 --> 05:26.494
SONYA: We know what he looks like.

05:26.562 --> 05:29.931
ROBLES: Has your fancy American
task force arrested him yet?

05:29.999 --> 05:33.167
No, they haven't.

06:16.173 --> 06:19.308
SONYA: He's not done.

06:19.376 --> 06:20.876
MARCO: I know.

06:20.944 --> 06:24.347
SONYA: How does this Juarez
playboy fit in to this?

06:26.716 --> 06:29.632
MARCO: Santiago Sol was a
suspect in the hit-and-run

06:29.656 --> 06:32.490
accident that killed
Tate's wife on the bridge.

06:38.728 --> 06:42.398
She told me she loved me, and...

06:42.466 --> 06:44.433
she wanted to be with me

06:44.501 --> 06:46.636
but it was nothing to me.

06:46.703 --> 06:48.003
SONYA: You used her for sex?

06:48.071 --> 06:49.605
MARCO: No.

06:49.673 --> 06:51.274
SONYA: You loved her?

06:51.341 --> 06:53.509
MARCO: No.

06:53.577 --> 06:55.511
SONYA: Well, you should've told her that.

06:55.579 --> 06:58.113
MARCO: Oh, she believed
what she wanted to believe.

06:58.182 --> 07:00.149
SONYA: That's 'cause you were lying to her.

07:00.217 --> 07:01.517
(Marco groans)

07:01.585 --> 07:03.085
(Mumbles in Spanish)

07:03.153 --> 07:06.855
MARCO: Sonya, not everything
is black and white.

07:11.695 --> 07:14.096
SONYA: What if he knows?

07:19.369 --> 07:21.470
MARCO: No.

07:21.538 --> 07:23.539
That's not possible.

07:23.607 --> 07:25.040
We were friends.

07:25.108 --> 07:27.210
I was at their funeral with him.

07:27.277 --> 07:28.678
He did not know.

07:28.745 --> 07:30.346
SONYA: What if he knows now.

07:30.414 --> 07:32.926
What if he knows now and he didn't kill you

07:32.950 --> 07:34.860
when he had the chance...

07:36.553 --> 07:38.258
because he's planning something else.

07:43.075 --> 07:44.707
I'm gonna go home.

08:00.377 --> 08:03.033
(Bird cooing softly)

08:03.302 --> 08:04.985
CHARLOTTE: Cesar?

08:14.989 --> 08:16.935
Hey, there, what are you doing out?

08:20.263 --> 08:22.428

08:27.952 --> 08:29.172
GRACIELA: Where's Ray?

08:30.817 --> 08:32.369
CHARLOTTE: I don't know.

08:37.688 --> 08:40.388
GRACIELA: Start with the face.

09:26.726 --> 09:27.928
(Gasps)

09:46.316 --> 09:47.830
CHARLOTTE: Thank you.

09:48.143 --> 09:49.894
CESAR: I had no choice.

09:55.532 --> 09:57.334
CHARLOTTE: What do we do now?

10:08.758 --> 10:10.504
She won't pick up.

10:12.909 --> 10:14.702
SONYA: When was the last
time you spoke with her?

10:14.996 --> 10:16.191
MARCO: Days.

10:21.077 --> 10:23.060
I have a bad feeling.

10:25.175 --> 10:26.276
SONYA: What about Gus?

10:26.326 --> 10:28.960
MARCO: Oh, he's not picking up either.

10:29.959 --> 10:32.395
(Speaks Spanish)

10:36.819 --> 10:38.389
ZINA: Booh!

10:38.708 --> 10:40.047
(Gus laughs)

10:40.167 --> 10:42.043
GUS: Zina, hi.

10:42.163 --> 10:43.663
You scared me.

10:44.140 --> 10:45.516
ZINA: Something wrong?

10:46.910 --> 10:48.519
GUS: No, you... you just..

10:48.779 --> 10:50.552
well, yeah, it's just... just..

10:50.577 --> 10:52.223
I thought you said you were still in, uh,

10:52.343 --> 10:54.744
out of town and, that's why
we couldn't meet until later?

10:55.552 --> 10:56.446
ZINA: Huh.

10:57.391 --> 10:59.011
GUS: You said you were still In Laredo.

10:59.856 --> 11:01.489
- ZINA: I did?
- GUS: Yeah.

11:03.891 --> 11:05.843
(Chuckles) Are you messing with me?

11:06.049 --> 11:08.039
I... I have the text.

11:11.518 --> 11:13.376
ZINA: Um, that's not me, Gus.

11:13.395 --> 11:14.896
That's my old cell number.

11:15.303 --> 11:17.223
We haven't texted since I moved.

11:18.093 --> 11:21.641
Hopefully, you didn't
tell this girl too much.

11:22.629 --> 11:24.093
GUS: Wait, so..

11:25.639 --> 11:27.297
we are not meeting later?

11:27.760 --> 11:29.699
ZINA: Um, no.

11:30.018 --> 11:31.852
GUS: Okay, uh..

11:33.284 --> 11:37.092
I... I have to go.

11:40.110 --> 11:41.793
MARCO: Alma?!

11:42.994 --> 11:43.833
Alma?!

11:55.180 --> 11:56.760
(Mutters)

11:57.848 --> 11:59.849
(Speaks Spanish)

12:01.742 --> 12:03.165
(Grunting)

12:03.285 --> 12:05.293
(Yells)

12:06.184 --> 12:07.741
SONYA: Maybe they're out.

12:08.006 --> 12:09.641
MARCO: At this hour?

12:11.471 --> 12:13.403
Where would they be?

12:17.939 --> 12:19.174
Rosario...

12:24.861 --> 12:27.031
Uh, okay.

12:34.255 --> 12:36.093
(Sighs)

12:36.592 --> 12:38.087
Okay. No, no, no, no...

12:44.891 --> 12:46.566
They're with Alma.

12:46.847 --> 12:48.875
She picked them up an hour ago.

12:48.995 --> 12:50.879
SONYA: That's good.

12:52.068 --> 12:53.727
Is it hard to sleep next to the

12:53.847 --> 12:55.535
same person every night?

12:56.146 --> 12:58.382
MARCO: Not now, Sonya.

12:58.502 --> 13:00.093
I'm trying to find Alma

13:00.093 --> 13:01.169
and my kids, all right?

13:01.289 --> 13:02.989
I need your help.

13:03.109 --> 13:04.700
SONYA: I'm sorry.

13:05.470 --> 13:08.268
Tell me about David Tate.

13:11.323 --> 13:13.120
MARCO: Oh, he..

13:13.608 --> 13:16.504
he wanted to make a difference.

13:17.397 --> 13:20.212
Kept trying to open an investigation

13:20.231 --> 13:21.889
on the dead girls of Juarez.

13:21.914 --> 13:23.008
SONYA: What happened?

13:23.128 --> 13:24.404
MARCO: His bosses

13:24.842 --> 13:26.350
shut us down.

13:26.907 --> 13:28.033
SONYA: Oh.

13:29.659 --> 13:31.080
Was he good at his job?

13:31.200 --> 13:32.212
(Marco sighs)

13:33.157 --> 13:34.214
MARCO: Very.

13:38.800 --> 13:41.015
By then, the accident happened and...

13:41.284 --> 13:43.036
he changed.

13:44.137 --> 13:46.521
SONYA: So he's gonna be good at this.

13:48.980 --> 13:50.731
MARCO: What... what does that mean?

13:50.775 --> 13:52.402
SONYA: Whatever he's planning next,

13:52.415 --> 13:54.161
he won't make mistakes.

13:54.965 --> 13:57.506
MARCO: Did you really
have to say that right now?

13:58.101 --> 13:59.702
SONYA: It's the truth.

13:59.769 --> 14:01.079
MARCO: That is the problem, Sonya!

14:01.142 --> 14:02.324
Why can't you just tell people

14:02.312 --> 14:03.957
what they want to hear?

14:04.574 --> 14:05.532
SONYA: What do you want to hear?

14:05.570 --> 14:07.657
MARCO: I want to hear my
family's gonna be okay.

14:07.777 --> 14:10.250
I really need to believe that right now.

14:10.675 --> 14:12.909
SONYA: Okay, okay

14:13.772 --> 14:14.767
MARCO: All right.

14:14.805 --> 14:17.514
(Phone vibrating)

14:18.465 --> 14:19.822
MARCO: It's her.

14:20.761 --> 14:21.887
Alma?

14:22.131 --> 14:23.332
KENNETH: Hello, Marco.

14:24.627 --> 14:26.448
It's been a long time.

14:31.960 --> 14:33.705
MARCO: Where is my family?

14:38.123 --> 14:40.750
KENNETH: You have a
beautiful family, Marco.

14:44.360 --> 14:45.730
It's hard to imagine why a man

14:45.782 --> 14:47.401
would just throw that away

14:47.613 --> 14:49.209
MARCO: Son of a bitch.

14:49.984 --> 14:51.104
I'm...

14:51.448 --> 14:52.699
I'm gonna kill you.

14:55.411 --> 14:57.463
KENNETH: Well, maybe
you'll get that chance.

14:57.583 --> 14:59.108
MARCO: Where are they?

14:59.803 --> 15:01.192
KENNETH: With me.

15:10.207 --> 15:11.395
(Taps table)

15:11.452 --> 15:13.053
Who wants to have some fun?

15:13.173 --> 15:14.605
(Girls laugh)

15:14.899 --> 15:15.951
ALMA: Is everything okay?

15:15.969 --> 15:17.552
KENNETH: Oh, yeah, it was just work.

15:18.078 --> 15:19.991
You sure you don't want
to call your husband  and

15:20.111 --> 15:21.707
let him know where you are?

15:21.719 --> 15:22.585
ALMA: No.

15:23.709 --> 15:25.129
KENNETH: I got you this..

15:25.142 --> 15:25.993
(Alma chuckles)

15:26.113 --> 15:27.425
And this.

15:27.638 --> 15:29.815
(Whispers): You look beautiful.

15:32.143 --> 15:33.288

15:40.236 --> 15:42.218
He has them!

16:06.707 --> 16:08.836

16:22.466 --> 16:23.881

16:27.957 --> 16:29.795

16:35.748 --> 16:37.792

17:16.412 --> 17:18.478
BOB: Depends on the situation.

17:18.598 --> 17:20.002
As we both know,

17:20.678 --> 17:23.723
sinning supposes a
belief in A higher power.

17:24.531 --> 17:26.828
Which you lack, Steven.

17:27.516 --> 17:28.967

18:13.102 --> 18:15.506

18:41.208 --> 18:42.641
special way.

18:46.308 --> 18:47.978
BOB: That's natural, Steven.

18:49.511 --> 18:52.464
Let's discuss this over a ham salad.

18:53.771 --> 18:56.237
LINDER: I'm so glad you said that.

18:56.249 --> 18:58.101
I've been so hungry of late.

18:58.639 --> 19:00.716
BOB: That happens after such things.

19:00.836 --> 19:02.030
My first kill,

19:02.092 --> 19:04.019
I couldn't get enough cheeseburgers.

19:06.291 --> 19:08.212
KENNETH: I used to come
here with my family.

19:08.657 --> 19:10.326
ALMA: What was your son's name?

19:12.561 --> 19:14.111
KENNETH: Caleb.

19:16.401 --> 19:17.733
He used to

19:18.841 --> 19:20.605
put rocks on  that slide.

19:22.200 --> 19:23.696
That was his thing, you know?

19:23.734 --> 19:24.616
That and...

19:24.985 --> 19:26.406
Legos.

19:28.332 --> 19:30.185
Made him totally happy.

19:32.647 --> 19:34.815
ALMA: How did it happen?

19:37.396 --> 19:38.852
(Kenneth sighs)

19:38.920 --> 19:40.455
KENNETH: A car accident.

19:41.259 --> 19:42.910
ALMA: We don't have to talk about this.

19:42.942 --> 19:44.568
KENNETH: Oh, it's okay.

19:46.273 --> 19:49.222
(Sighs) Feels good to talk about it.

19:49.731 --> 19:51.732
Especially with you.

19:54.431 --> 19:56.613
It made me a different person.

19:58.673 --> 20:00.421
I... I was mad...

20:01.086 --> 20:02.916
at the world.

20:04.042 --> 20:05.176
I'd see...

20:05.997 --> 20:08.891
happy families on the street and..

20:11.151 --> 20:13.567
I'd wish bad things on them.

20:14.928 --> 20:16.813
ALMA: That must be terrible.

20:19.284 --> 20:21.302
KENNETH: I still have that anger.

20:23.555 --> 20:25.447
Work on it every day.

20:28.770 --> 20:31.626
ALMA: I can't imagine
losing a child like that.

20:33.442 --> 20:35.442
KENNETH: I hope you never do.

20:38.880 --> 20:40.423
ALMA: Yeah.

20:43.036 --> 20:45.069
KENNETH: Well, uh..

20:45.844 --> 20:49.160
let's get the girls
something to eat, and, uh,

20:49.864 --> 20:52.155

21:28.384 --> 21:31.599
What is wrong? Where is Alma and the girls?

21:33.577 --> 21:34.484
MARCO: We don't know.

21:34.509 --> 21:35.454
SONYA: Gus,

21:36.142 --> 21:38.457

21:39.013 --> 21:40.522
GUS: Mr. Hasting?

21:40.642 --> 21:42.023
The guy who works with Alma?

21:42.047 --> 21:42.943
MARCO: What?

21:43.011 --> 21:44.229
GUS: At the university.

21:44.268 --> 21:45.707
Why are you asking about him?

21:46.815 --> 21:48.546
MARCO: Okay, listen to me.

21:48.874 --> 21:50.211
I need to know

21:50.250 --> 21:52.487
if Alma said anything about leaving.

21:52.769 --> 21:53.817
GUS: No.

21:55.694 --> 21:57.532
And Sophia and Lilly?

21:59.909 --> 22:01.919
I thought you said you had the guy.

22:02.982 --> 22:04.453
MARCO: We were wrong.

22:04.700 --> 22:06.701
(Phone ringing)

22:08.535 --> 22:10.122
SONYA: Sonya Cross.

22:10.639 --> 22:13.125
MARCO: Has Kenneth been in my house?

22:14.042 --> 22:16.254
GUS: I... I don't know. Maybe.

22:18.247 --> 22:20.595
MARCO: You should have told me that, Gus.

22:21.182 --> 22:23.332
GUS: I know, it's... she asked me not to.

22:23.752 --> 22:25.006
(Marco sighs)

22:25.022 --> 22:26.366
Are you sure it's the same guy?

22:26.593 --> 22:28.274
MARCO: Yes.

22:29.324 --> 22:30.925
GUS: Are they going to be okay?

22:31.045 --> 22:32.114
MARCO: I don't know.

22:32.169 --> 22:33.858
SONYA: They found Hasting's apartment.

22:35.258 --> 22:36.711
I'm taking you to the station.

22:36.705 --> 22:38.598
It's not safe for you here, all right?

22:38.718 --> 22:40.428
Let's go.

22:44.369 --> 22:45.792
WADE: Hey.

22:45.912 --> 22:49.069
He had this entire building wired to blow.

22:49.664 --> 22:51.533
- MARCO: Any sign of him?
- WADE: Nothing yet.

22:51.572 --> 22:52.534
Listen.

22:52.654 --> 22:53.652
We're gonna get this guy,

22:53.676 --> 22:55.363
and we're gonna get
your wife and kids back.

22:55.870 --> 22:57.297
COOPER: Hey.

22:57.928 --> 23:01.239
This guy had a lot of
free time on his hands.

23:02.190 --> 23:03.216
SONYA: What you got?

23:03.253 --> 23:04.862
COOPER: See for yourself.

23:06.231 --> 23:07.858
COOPER: Watch your step.

25:08.658 --> 25:10.150
KENNETH: Ah.

25:10.928 --> 25:12.434
ALMA: Is this the surprise?

25:12.692 --> 25:14.869
KENNETH: No, I've been working
on this for a long time.

25:15.101 --> 25:16.534
Used to be an old hunting cabin.

25:16.572 --> 25:17.925
You're not gonna believe what I've done.

25:18.161 --> 25:20.193
I got two hamsters. Who
wants to feed 'em first?

25:20.261 --> 25:21.301
(girls giggling)

25:21.345 --> 25:22.527
Come on.

25:25.236 --> 25:26.700
You coming?

25:27.095 --> 25:28.201
ALMA: Yeah.

25:28.269 --> 25:29.704
KENNETH: Come on.

25:30.872 --> 25:32.194
Okay.

25:33.490 --> 25:35.390
- No peeking.
- ALMA: Oh.

25:36.093 --> 25:36.831
Okay

25:36.875 --> 25:37.963
(Kenneth chuckles)

25:42.625 --> 25:44.364
KENNETH: Here we go.

25:44.589 --> 25:45.686
(Alma chuckles)

25:46.199 --> 25:47.902
- No peeking.
- ALMA: Okay.

25:48.420 --> 25:49.816
KENNETH: Promise?

25:50.723 --> 25:52.400
ALMA: I promise.

26:02.736 --> 26:03.818
KENNETH: Girls,

26:05.007 --> 26:06.953
tell your mommy to keep her eyes shut.

26:07.760 --> 26:10.569
This is a very big surprise.

26:14.430 --> 26:15.697
ALMA: I really don't want to

26:15.731 --> 26:17.545
play this game anymore.

26:22.263 --> 26:24.227
You're scaring the girls.

26:30.258 --> 26:32.600
(Light metallic rattling)

26:35.475 --> 26:36.845
KENNETH: Almost.

26:37.405 --> 26:38.647
Almost.

26:39.573 --> 26:41.249
Hold out your hand.

26:41.576 --> 26:42.510
ALMA: Hmm.

26:42.577 --> 26:44.340
KENNETH: Hold out your hand.

26:46.135 --> 26:47.674
Okay.

26:48.582 --> 26:51.622
Now, hold on to this very tight.

26:55.840 --> 26:57.754
Open your eyes.

27:04.936 --> 27:05.912
ALMA: Oh, God

27:05.974 --> 27:07.376
KENNETH: Now, careful.

27:09.091 --> 27:10.536
Take your hand off that lever,

27:10.605 --> 27:11.462
you only have five seconds

27:11.472 --> 27:13.351
to say good-bye to your daughters.

27:19.089 --> 27:20.665
Surprise.

27:21.191 --> 27:22.736
ALMA: Oh, God.

27:24.482 --> 27:26.459
No, no, no, no, no

27:27.178 --> 27:28.799
Stop! (shouts) No wait!

27:28.855 --> 27:30.356
What are you doing?!

27:30.358 --> 27:31.491
What are you doing?!

27:33.597 --> 27:35.328
ALMA: Open the door!

27:35.396 --> 27:36.597
Kenneth!

27:36.665 --> 27:38.514
What are you doing?

27:38.583 --> 27:40.479
The door... open the door.

Open the door.

BOB: Lies

28:06.788 --> 28:09.453

28:09.941 --> 28:11.543
They cling to you

28:11.924 --> 28:13.820
till you speak the truth...

28:14.358 --> 28:16.060
and you set them free.

28:21.159 --> 28:22.585
Eva,

28:23.167 --> 28:25.651
Steven has something he'd like to tell you.

29:15.986 --> 29:17.137

29:19.589 --> 29:22.174
LINDER: He attacked me in my home,

29:22.655 --> 29:25.483
and I didn't have a choice.

29:31.183 --> 29:32.809

Zina this whole time, but...

30:46.370 --> 30:48.058
And so whoever I was texting

30:48.127 --> 30:49.991
I told them things about the case,

30:50.406 --> 30:52.408
because they said they were interested.

35:23.999 --> 35:25.230
(Screams)

35:25.280 --> 35:27.113
(Sobbing)

35:30.605 --> 35:32.088
GUS: Have you heard from my dad?

35:32.332 --> 35:33.458
SONYA: No.

35:35.116 --> 35:36.230
GUS: I'm worried.

35:36.415 --> 35:37.225
SONYA: I know.

35:37.243 --> 35:39.039
I'll let you know if we hear anything.

35:43.475 --> 35:44.851
GUS: So that is Gina?

35:46.124 --> 35:47.060
SONYA: Yes.

35:47.341 --> 35:49.219
GUS: I didn't know I was talking to him.

35:49.575 --> 35:50.589
SONYA: He's smart.

35:50.802 --> 35:53.198
He's been planning this for a long time.

35:54.866 --> 35:56.457
GUS: What's weird is...

35:57.571 --> 35:59.497
he made me closer to my dad.

36:00.617 --> 36:01.975
SONYA: What are you talking about, Gus?

36:02.006 --> 36:03.157
GUS: When we were chatting.

36:03.420 --> 36:05.141
SONYA: You thought you
were talking to a girl.

36:05.197 --> 36:06.186
GUS: I know, but

36:06.692 --> 36:07.987
he gave good advice

36:08.895 --> 36:11.091
when I told him how I was
feeling about my father.

36:11.823 --> 36:13.888
SONYA: Gus...

36:14.995 --> 36:16.760
I have work to do.

36:21.059 --> 36:22.085
GUS: Yeah.

36:23.674 --> 36:25.007
Sure.

36:30.118 --> 36:32.007
MARCO: Should be down there.

36:37.251 --> 36:38.890
WADE: Gonna have this rigged, Marco.

36:38.922 --> 36:40.286
Could be rigged.

36:45.884 --> 36:47.062
Marco, easy!

36:47.237 --> 36:48.608
Go easy, easy, easy!

36:48.633 --> 36:50.621
MARCO: Alma! Alma!

36:55.108 --> 36:57.123
MARCO: I need something
to break down this down.

36:58.331 --> 36:59.519
WADE: Look out.

37:02.535 --> 37:03.586
(Marco speaks Spanish)

37:12.119 --> 37:13.501
ALMA: Marco.

37:25.615 --> 37:26.896
WADE: Come on, go, go, go!

37:27.016 --> 37:28.510
Run, run, run, run, run!

37:49.119 --> 37:51.047
- Okay.
- ALMA: Okay.

38:23.314 --> 38:25.577
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

38:28.019 --> 38:30.608
(Panting)

38:33.492 --> 38:34.843
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

38:36.494 --> 38:37.633
(Alma sighs)

38:50.178 --> 38:51.223
SONYA: Hey.

38:51.343 --> 38:52.455
They're okay.

38:52.474 --> 38:53.657
Your father has them.

38:53.801 --> 38:54.558
GUS: Did they get him?

38:54.608 --> 38:55.115
SONYA: No.

38:55.121 --> 38:56.254
GUS: I want to go home.

38:56.374 --> 38:57.054
SONYA: You can't.

38:57.104 --> 38:58.569
I'm driving you to a safe house.

38:58.569 --> 39:00.601
Your father will meet you there. Let's go.

39:03.135 --> 39:05.249
(Panting)

39:11.293 --> 39:12.926
CHARLOTTE: That's probably deep enough.

39:13.245 --> 39:15.153
(Cesar coughs)

39:15.673 --> 39:17.337
(Grunts)

39:19.189 --> 39:20.491
(Cesar grunts)

39:20.509 --> 39:21.867
CESAR: Gracias.

39:25.483 --> 39:26.935
You gonna tell Ray.

39:27.911 --> 39:29.086
CHARLOTTE: Should I?

39:29.206 --> 39:30.244
(Cesar grunts)

39:32.947 --> 39:34.593
CESAR: I don't think it's a good idea.

39:36.582 --> 39:38.021
CHARLOTTE: Wait.

39:39.723 --> 39:41.080
Let me.

39:54.362 --> 39:55.729
What happens next?

39:55.796 --> 39:56.947
(Cesar sighs)

39:57.332 --> 39:58.732
CESAR: Lime.

39:59.519 --> 40:01.302
It will speed up the decomposition.

40:01.333 --> 40:02.829
Bodies will be gone in a week.

40:05.432 --> 40:07.522
CHARLOTTE: No, I mean what happens next.

40:07.966 --> 40:09.123
CESAR: Ah, it depends.

40:09.744 --> 40:10.910
Hopefully, nothing.

40:11.908 --> 40:13.666
I'm gonna take my wife
out to go see a movie

40:13.960 --> 40:16.218
and pretend none of this happened

40:17.788 --> 40:19.240
CHARLOTTE: Thank you, Cesar.

40:19.854 --> 40:21.729
You saved my life.

40:25.393 --> 40:26.589
CHARLOTTE: We'll talk tomorrow...

40:29.086 --> 40:30.794
- about the tunnel.
- CESAR: Ah.

40:31.031 --> 40:32.245
CHARLOTTE: How it's gonna work now?

40:33.283 --> 40:34.353
CESAR: Okay.

40:52.196 --> 40:53.641
SONYA: We know who he is.

40:53.879 --> 40:55.080
We'll get him.

40:56.357 --> 40:58.396
GUS: So this is all about my dad?

40:58.603 --> 40:59.948
SONYA: I didn't say that.

41:00.528 --> 41:01.750
GUS: What did he do?

41:02.845 --> 41:04.528
SONYA: You should ask him that.

41:07.975 --> 41:09.940
GUS: Why would Mr. Hasting do this?

41:10.060 --> 41:11.923
It doesn't make sense.

41:12.607 --> 41:14.307
What if he's not done?

41:17.144 --> 41:18.317
SONYA: It doesn't make sense.

41:18.586 --> 41:19.844
GUS: What?
