you're basically hosted

26:25.330 --> 26:26.889
by one of our subjects.

26:26.890 --> 26:29.029
Now our subjects are real humans,

26:29.030 --> 26:31.309
so you'll remain exactly the same

26:31.310 --> 26:33.139
in terms of mentally and physically,

26:33.140 --> 26:36.889
but you'll be able to
feel the human touch

are experiencing,

26:38.710 --> 26:40.840
in whatever scenario of your choice.

26:40.841 --> 26:44.239
And you'll also have another
option where you can be

one of our subjects

in these microchips into Axel.

microchips where they release

44:11.677 --> 44:13.277

then I asked Max about it

44:14.820 --> 44:16.759

suspicious and weird about it

44:16.760 --> 44:18.258
