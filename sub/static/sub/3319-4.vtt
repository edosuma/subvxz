WEBVTT

00:03.612 --> 00:05.135
Previously onMom...You have no right to tell me
who I can and cannot see!

00:05.222 --> 00:07.224
What are you saying,
we're not monogamous?

00:07.311 --> 00:09.748
Gabriel, you're married.

00:09.835 --> 00:11.228
We do it once a month,

00:11.315 --> 00:13.926
and I don't even take off
my T-shirt.

00:15.624 --> 00:18.192
I've been sober 118 days.

00:18.279 --> 00:19.845
Oh! Don't applaud for that.

00:19.932 --> 00:23.458
They've been the worst 118 days
of my life.

00:23.545 --> 00:26.983
Um... the only reason I'm here

00:27.070 --> 00:31.074
is because, uh, I didn't want
to turn into my mother.

00:31.161 --> 00:34.730
I mean, some mothers teach
their daughters how to bake,

00:34.817 --> 00:37.080
mine taught me how
to beat a cavity search

00:37.167 --> 00:40.562
and still feel like a lady.

00:40.649 --> 00:42.346
You doing all right?

00:42.433 --> 00:46.220
I... don't know.

00:46.307 --> 00:47.743
Excuse me.

00:51.181 --> 00:53.879
I can't believe this!

00:53.966 --> 00:55.098
Hey, you have to take some
of the responsibility

00:55.185 --> 00:57.231
for this pregnancy.

00:57.318 --> 00:58.971
We had the talk.

00:59.059 --> 01:01.583
I told her about abstinence,
condoms, everything.

01:01.670 --> 01:03.628
Did you mention oral sex
as a work-around?

01:03.715 --> 01:05.978
Oh, my God, it ismy fault.

01:13.464 --> 01:15.205
Oh, God, I hate this part.

01:15.292 --> 01:16.815
Just be cool.

01:19.688 --> 01:21.124
I can barely walk
with all the crap

01:21.211 --> 01:22.560
you've taped
to my thighs.

01:22.647 --> 01:24.562
Well, there was another place
to hide it,

01:24.649 --> 01:26.695
but you're too dainty.

01:26.782 --> 01:29.698
I told you
that's exit only.

01:31.047 --> 01:31.656
Next, please.

01:31.743 --> 01:32.092
Here we go.

01:36.444 --> 01:38.533
Welcome back
to the United States.

01:38.620 --> 01:40.012
Is your trip for business
or pleasure?

01:40.100 --> 01:41.405
Pleasure.
Business.

01:41.492 --> 01:43.712
Business.
Pleasure.

01:43.799 --> 01:45.627
The point is,
we're thrilled to be back.

01:45.714 --> 01:48.282
God bless America!
Home of our ancestors!

01:48.369 --> 01:51.067
And the birthplace of jazz.

01:53.069 --> 01:54.026
Okay.

01:54.114 --> 01:56.507
Whose bag is this?

01:56.594 --> 01:57.900
My mom's.

01:57.987 --> 01:59.510
No, I'm pretty sure
that's yours, honey.

01:59.597 --> 02:01.295
See? It's got
your nametag right on it.

02:01.382 --> 02:04.211
Yeah, but that's
not my bag.

02:04.298 --> 02:06.256
Well, it certainly ain't mine,
muchacha.

02:07.997 --> 02:10.478
Well, what do we have here?

02:11.261 --> 02:14.395
Christy!

02:14.482 --> 02:15.483
How could you?!

02:15.570 --> 02:19.182
What?! This is not my bag,

02:19.269 --> 02:20.879
and I've never
seen that before!

02:20.966 --> 02:25.014
Oh, sweetheart, did prison
teach you nothing?

02:25.101 --> 02:27.364
I've never been to prison!

02:27.451 --> 02:29.671
Look, I don't want to tell you
how to do your job,

02:29.758 --> 02:31.151
but check her thighs--
their street value is $80,000.

02:33.109 --> 02:34.328
Mom!

02:34.415 --> 02:35.111
[gasps]

02:42.901 --> 02:44.076
[phone rings]

02:48.907 --> 02:51.301
What?!

02:51.388 --> 02:53.173
You sold me out to the Feds!

02:53.260 --> 02:54.957
Oh, honey...

02:55.044 --> 02:56.088
are you drinking again?

02:58.439 --> 03:00.092
No, I just dreamt

03:00.180 --> 03:01.790
that you and I were smuggling
drugs from Mexico,

03:01.877 --> 03:04.532
and when it went bad,
you made me take the fall!

03:04.619 --> 03:06.751
Oh, how awful.It is!

03:06.838 --> 03:08.536
You know, when you were
a little girl

03:08.623 --> 03:10.364
and had a bad dream, I let you
crawl in bed with me

03:10.451 --> 03:11.626
until you felt safe.

03:11.713 --> 03:13.105
You did?

03:13.193 --> 03:14.759
I did.

03:14.846 --> 03:17.022
But now you're a fully grown
crazy person,

03:17.109 --> 03:18.110
so I'm just gonna hang up!

03:20.809 --> 03:22.854
Mom? Mom...?

03:26.336 --> 03:28.295
[sighs]

03:30.993 --> 03:33.909
Of all the things
to yell at my mother for,

03:33.996 --> 03:35.911
I had to pick the one
that didn't happen.

03:56.540 --> 03:59.064
Hey, Mom, I just wanted
to call and say I'm sorry

03:59.151 --> 04:00.849
for yelling at you.

04:00.936 --> 04:04.113
I know it was just a dream,
but it seemed so real.

04:04.200 --> 04:05.549
Hang on. I gotta spit.

04:10.206 --> 04:12.817
Anyway, call me back...

04:12.904 --> 04:16.386
unless you're gonna punish me
with silence, which is so you.

04:16.473 --> 04:17.909
Probably what you're doing
right now.

04:17.995 --> 04:19.346
Well, you know what?
It's not gonna work.

04:19.433 --> 04:20.564
I'm not gonna let you get
in my head.

04:20.651 --> 04:21.608
Go to hell!

04:24.438 --> 04:27.528
That's gonna come back
and bite me in the ass.

04:31.096 --> 04:33.055
Why aren't you dressed?
We're gonna be late.

04:33.142 --> 04:35.536
My underpants are crunchy.

04:35.623 --> 04:38.974
What do you mean, "crunchy"?

04:39.061 --> 04:40.367
I don't know what happened.

04:40.454 --> 04:41.542
They were soft yesterday.

04:43.892 --> 04:45.981
Oh, honey, you can't keep
wearing the same underwear.

04:46.068 --> 04:47.374
Put on some clean ones.

04:47.461 --> 04:49.245
I don't have any clean ones.

04:49.332 --> 04:50.681
And you're telling me this
five minutes

04:50.768 --> 04:51.813
before you have
to leave for school?

04:51.900 --> 04:52.596
I'm as surprised as you are.

04:55.904 --> 04:57.384
All right.
Let's go see

04:57.471 --> 04:59.516
if your sister has
a pair you can borrow.

04:59.603 --> 05:02.432
I'm not wearing
Violet's underpants!

05:02.519 --> 05:03.477
No one will know!

05:04.521 --> 05:07.002
I'll know.

05:07.089 --> 05:09.178
Violet, do you have
any old underwear

05:09.265 --> 05:09.918
Roscoe could wear?

05:10.005 --> 05:12.137
Seriously?

05:12.224 --> 05:13.530
You haven't screwed him up
enough?

05:15.227 --> 05:15.880
It's a yes or no question.

05:15.967 --> 05:19.014
So was mine.

05:19.101 --> 05:21.625
Forget it; I'll just buy him
some on the way to school.

05:21.712 --> 05:23.235
Ugh, that reminds me,

05:23.323 --> 05:25.194
I'm gonna need some money
for some new jeans.

05:25.281 --> 05:26.848
I'm, like, seriously
bloated lately.

05:29.546 --> 05:32.767
[mocking]:
Violet, you're, like, seriously
pregnant lately.

05:35.160 --> 05:36.684
And you have a job.

05:36.771 --> 05:38.163
You want new jeans,
spend your own money.

05:38.250 --> 05:40.557
I'm not wasting
my money on fat pants.

05:40.644 --> 05:41.558
Oh, so you're okay
to waste mine?

05:41.645 --> 05:42.516
Well, I was hoping...

05:42.603 --> 05:43.778
Listen, Juno...

05:46.520 --> 05:49.610
...the minute you got pregnant,
life as you know it ended.

05:49.697 --> 05:51.263
It's time you got ready

05:51.351 --> 05:53.396
for the dream-sucking monster
which is about

05:53.483 --> 05:54.354
to shoot out
of your hoo-ha

05:54.441 --> 05:56.486
and gobble up your life!

05:59.489 --> 06:01.361
You're a horrible woman.

06:02.710 --> 06:04.625
And soon you'll be one, too!

06:08.933 --> 06:10.674
Ah, here.

06:10.761 --> 06:12.284
Clean underwear.

06:12.372 --> 06:14.025
I don't want to wear these.

06:14.112 --> 06:15.375
What's wrong with them?

06:15.462 --> 06:17.551
They have anchors.

06:17.638 --> 06:20.684
What's wrong with anchors?

06:20.771 --> 06:22.251
They're stupid.

06:22.338 --> 06:24.253
Oh, for God's sake,
it's just a design.

06:24.340 --> 06:25.689
It doesn't mean anything.

06:25.776 --> 06:26.821
Well, I like my underwear
to make sense.

06:29.737 --> 06:31.869
I'm not having
this conversation with you.

06:31.956 --> 06:33.741
Then who is?

06:33.828 --> 06:36.744
Excuse me, can my son
change in your bathroom?

06:36.831 --> 06:38.659
We don't have
a bathroom.

06:38.746 --> 06:39.790
Of course you have
a bathroom.

06:39.877 --> 06:42.053
Come on.
Help me out here.

06:42.140 --> 06:43.185
Sorry, it's not
for public use.

06:43.272 --> 06:45.187
Okay, look,
I'm in a hurry.

06:45.274 --> 06:46.580
I gotta get him to school.

06:46.667 --> 06:48.059
Can't you make
an exception?

06:48.146 --> 06:50.366
I don't make the rules.

06:50.453 --> 06:53.413
No, but you have a brain
and you could use it now

06:53.500 --> 06:56.546
to help my little boy put
on a pair of clean underpants!

06:56.633 --> 06:57.808
Mom, it's okay.

06:57.895 --> 06:59.201
I got this, Roscoe!

06:59.288 --> 06:59.636
I don't think you do.

07:02.422 --> 07:04.032
Why don't I just change
in the car?

07:04.119 --> 07:06.687
No, you are gonna change...

07:06.774 --> 07:09.690
right here!

07:09.777 --> 07:12.083
In the store?
I'm not an animal.

07:12.170 --> 07:14.042
Go ahead!
No one can see!

07:14.129 --> 07:16.218
Ma'am, he can't take his clothes
off in here.

07:16.305 --> 07:17.393
Want to bet?

07:17.480 --> 07:18.829
Take your clothes off in here.

07:18.916 --> 07:20.570
Please don't make me call
security.

07:20.657 --> 07:22.267
No, no, go ahead.
I want you to.

07:22.354 --> 07:24.139
In fact, I'll do it for you.

07:24.226 --> 07:27.011
Security! Nine-year-old
changing into anchor underpants

07:27.098 --> 07:28.143
in aisle eleven!

07:28.230 --> 07:30.362
Shoot to kill!

07:30.450 --> 07:33.627
You're a horrible woman.

07:33.714 --> 07:39.067
Oh, like I haven't heard that
today from some other bitch!

07:39.154 --> 07:41.722
[sweetly]:
Go ahead, honey. Go on, change.

07:46.335 --> 07:49.033
So one regular coffee
and a latte.

07:49.120 --> 07:50.644
Mm-hmm.

07:50.731 --> 07:52.341
You know, sweetie,
you'd be so much prettier

07:52.428 --> 07:53.777
if you smiled once in a while.

07:55.866 --> 07:57.389
Excuse me?

07:57.477 --> 07:59.957
Show a little teeth.
Brighten the world up!

08:02.133 --> 08:05.049
I'm sorry; I'll-I'll
certainly give that a try.

08:05.136 --> 08:06.703
Try it now.

08:11.273 --> 08:13.928
There you go.
Was that so hard?

08:15.233 --> 08:16.844
It's amazing you got to teach

08:16.931 --> 08:18.715
a broad who works for tips
basic courtesy.

08:24.460 --> 08:24.895
[sighs]

08:27.811 --> 08:28.769
You look really pretty today.

08:28.856 --> 08:30.858
Did you change your hair?

08:30.945 --> 08:32.424
Bite me!

08:34.514 --> 08:38.342
Is it just me, or do crazy
waitresses give you a woody?

08:50.181 --> 08:51.139
Hi.

08:51.226 --> 08:52.140
Hi.

08:52.227 --> 08:53.968
Christy, right?

08:54.055 --> 08:56.144
Yeah. How'd you know my name?

08:56.231 --> 08:56.971
We met at your first meeting.

08:57.058 --> 08:58.973
I'm Marjorie.

08:59.060 --> 09:02.716
I'm sorry. I spent
most of that meeting crying

09:02.803 --> 09:05.501
and vomiting into my purse.

09:05.588 --> 09:07.982
And you wonder why
I remember your name.

09:09.549 --> 09:10.680
How's it going now?

09:10.767 --> 09:13.770
Well, got a new purse.

09:13.857 --> 09:15.467
Very nice.

09:15.555 --> 09:17.295
Unfortunately, that's
about the only thing

09:17.382 --> 09:18.209
I got going for me.

09:18.296 --> 09:21.517
Sorry to hear it.

09:21.604 --> 09:23.606
Did you ever have one
of those days

09:23.693 --> 09:25.826
where everyone you meet
is a gigantic ass?

09:25.913 --> 09:29.177
Everyone, huh?

09:29.264 --> 09:30.526
Yeah.

09:30.613 --> 09:32.789
My mom, my kids,
the people at work,

09:32.876 --> 09:36.880
even some idiot clerk
at the 99-Cent Store.

09:36.967 --> 09:38.926
Yeah, I've had days
like that,

09:39.013 --> 09:41.058
and you know what
I finally figured out?

09:41.145 --> 09:43.278
What?

09:43.365 --> 09:45.933
If everyone I meet's an ass,
maybe I'mthe ass.

09:48.500 --> 09:50.328
Wait-- you're saying
I'm the problem?

09:50.415 --> 09:53.331
You're very quick.

09:55.682 --> 09:56.857
[mocking]:
You're very quick.

10:02.253 --> 10:04.386
Oh, God, I amthe ass.

10:10.740 --> 10:12.786
SUSAN:
Okay, everyone, I think we're
ready to get started.

10:12.873 --> 10:14.875
Please remember
there is no parking

10:14.962 --> 10:16.703
in the lot adjacent
to the building....

10:16.790 --> 10:19.009
You know, I get that I have to
take responsibility for my life,

10:19.096 --> 10:20.184
but you have no idea
what it was like

10:20.271 --> 10:21.359
growing up with my mother.

10:21.446 --> 10:22.709
I'm sure it was
a nightmare,

10:22.796 --> 10:25.320
but you're not
a child anymore.

10:25.407 --> 10:27.583
I know that,
but she makes me so mad!

10:29.367 --> 10:31.239
You got two options, sweetie:

10:31.326 --> 10:32.806
you can stay angry
at your mother

10:32.893 --> 10:34.721
and be miserable for
the rest of your life,

10:34.808 --> 10:37.027
or you can let it go
and be happy.

10:37.114 --> 10:39.377
SUSAN: The main doors
should stay closed

10:39.464 --> 10:40.509
during the meeting...

10:40.596 --> 10:42.467
Isn't there
a third option?

10:55.350 --> 10:56.960
Hi, Mom.

10:57.047 --> 10:58.701
Hello.

11:00.964 --> 11:01.530
Thanks for meeting me.

11:01.617 --> 11:04.925
Oh, sure.

11:06.622 --> 11:08.929
Um, listen,
I want to apologize

11:09.016 --> 11:10.757
for yelling at you
the other day.

11:13.629 --> 11:14.412
Mm-hmm.

11:18.808 --> 11:20.201
That's it?

11:20.288 --> 11:21.332
That's all
you're gonna say?

11:21.419 --> 11:22.420
"Mm-hmm"?

11:23.944 --> 11:25.641
Mm-hmm.

11:26.337 --> 11:28.296
[sighs]

11:28.383 --> 11:29.340
Anyway,
I feel terrible.

11:29.427 --> 11:31.821
Just "terrible"?

11:33.736 --> 11:35.216
What do you mean?

11:35.303 --> 11:37.522
Well, I would think
you'd feel ashamed, as well.

11:39.350 --> 11:40.874
Okay. Ashamed.

11:40.961 --> 11:42.789
Maybe a little dopey.

11:42.876 --> 11:43.790
Dopey, Doc and Sneezy.

11:43.877 --> 11:46.401
Are we good?

11:46.488 --> 11:48.098
I came in here good.

11:51.362 --> 11:53.887
Whatever.

11:53.974 --> 11:55.976
Let's just eat.

11:56.063 --> 11:57.629
Lunch is on me.

11:57.717 --> 12:00.284
It's my way of showing
I'm letting go of my anger.

12:00.371 --> 12:03.461
That's very
generous of you.

12:03.548 --> 12:05.289
Of course, if I were
flush with cash,

12:05.376 --> 12:07.248
I might buy my pregnant
daughter new jeans,

12:07.335 --> 12:08.292
but you're doing some
"tough love" thing-- I get it.

12:11.818 --> 12:12.775
You talked to Violet?

12:12.862 --> 12:14.298
She tweeted it.

12:16.431 --> 12:17.693
And did you defend me?

12:17.780 --> 12:19.347
Nope, I just retweeted
and moved on.

12:22.742 --> 12:24.047
Right there.

12:24.134 --> 12:25.309
That's where
my dream comes from.

12:25.396 --> 12:26.789
You never, ever
have my back.

12:26.876 --> 12:28.530
You always put your
needs ahead of mine.

12:28.617 --> 12:29.792
Well, I certainly
hope the salmon

12:29.879 --> 12:32.926
is more satisfying
than your apology.

12:34.666 --> 12:35.972
[growling]

12:36.059 --> 12:36.930
Don't growl, sweetheart;

12:37.017 --> 12:38.366
it's not very ladylike.

12:42.413 --> 12:44.720
Hey, buddy.

12:44.807 --> 12:46.461
I went and did
all your laundry,

12:46.548 --> 12:49.551
so you have nice,
fresh clothes for tomorrow.

12:52.684 --> 12:54.948
No need to thank me.

12:57.559 --> 13:00.692
Are you giving me
the cold, silent treatment,

13:00.780 --> 13:02.172
like your grandmother does?

13:02.259 --> 13:05.262
No, I'm doing a puzzle
and it's hard.

13:10.224 --> 13:11.747
You know, I'm really sorry

13:11.834 --> 13:14.010
I haven't been on top of
getting the laundry done.

13:14.097 --> 13:15.838
Or making sure
we have peanut butter.

13:15.925 --> 13:17.274
Oh, are we out of peanut butter?

13:17.361 --> 13:18.493
And jelly.

13:18.580 --> 13:20.016
Okay.

13:20.103 --> 13:20.495
And bread.

13:23.411 --> 13:24.629
Right.

13:24.716 --> 13:27.110
[sighs]

13:27.197 --> 13:29.156
Hey, can I help?

13:29.243 --> 13:29.852
Sure.

13:29.939 --> 13:30.461
[groans]

13:35.423 --> 13:36.728
You know...

13:36.816 --> 13:38.556
I want you to know

13:38.643 --> 13:40.602
that I will always
be there for you,

13:40.689 --> 13:42.038
no matter what.

13:42.125 --> 13:44.911
Nothing you do could
make me love you less.

13:44.998 --> 13:46.477
Even if I grow up
to be like Dad?

13:47.478 --> 13:49.916
Oh, honey...

13:50.003 --> 13:51.265
the fact that
you're doing a puzzle

13:51.352 --> 13:53.093
means you won't
end up like your dad.

13:59.055 --> 13:59.969
How's the cheesecake?

14:00.056 --> 14:01.014
Awesome.

14:04.191 --> 14:05.279
Do you like it, Violet?

14:05.366 --> 14:06.758
It's your favorite.

14:06.846 --> 14:08.412
I tell you I don't
fit into my pants,

14:08.499 --> 14:10.240
so you buy me
cheesecake?

14:12.025 --> 14:13.417
I was just trying
to do something
nice for you.

14:13.504 --> 14:15.419
Whatever.

14:18.553 --> 14:22.513
You know, Violet...

14:22.600 --> 14:25.125
your mom's making
a real effort, here,

14:25.212 --> 14:26.996
and you're not giving
her much to work with.

14:29.259 --> 14:30.391
Are you taking her side?

14:32.349 --> 14:33.350
It's okay, Luke.

14:33.437 --> 14:35.483
No, no, no.

14:35.570 --> 14:37.528
There are no sides
when it comes to family.

14:37.615 --> 14:39.400
We're a circle.

14:39.487 --> 14:41.706
Or a triangle...

14:43.795 --> 14:46.450
...but that would
have sides, so a circle.

14:49.149 --> 14:50.411
Luke, for your own sake,
stay out of this.

14:50.498 --> 14:52.413
Well, Christy,
I am this.

14:54.763 --> 14:56.069
You know, everyone
says you're all moody

14:56.156 --> 14:57.026
'cause you're pregnant,
but they're wrong.

14:57.113 --> 14:57.418
You've always been moody.

15:00.464 --> 15:01.901
Why don't you go
take out the garbage?

15:01.988 --> 15:02.989
Yes, dear.

15:06.296 --> 15:07.471
I learned to say that
from watching TV.

15:12.302 --> 15:13.390
Do you believe him?

15:13.477 --> 15:15.436
Yeah, that was pretty stupid.

15:15.523 --> 15:18.961
Do guys get smarter over time?

15:20.049 --> 15:21.572
Oh, honey...

15:21.659 --> 15:23.313
if they have the love
of a good woman,

15:23.400 --> 15:24.662
all things are possible...

15:24.749 --> 15:25.272
I'm sorry,
I can't lie to you.

15:25.359 --> 15:25.881
No.

15:25.968 --> 15:28.014
[laughs]

15:33.410 --> 15:34.498
Chef Rudy?

15:34.585 --> 15:36.500
Um...

15:36.587 --> 15:38.328
I want you to know
that I'm aware

15:38.415 --> 15:40.026
I've been kind of
bitchy lately,

15:40.113 --> 15:41.679
and I'm working on it.

15:41.766 --> 15:43.420
I'm trying to be
a better person.

15:43.507 --> 15:44.465
Appreciate
the sentiment.

15:44.552 --> 15:46.554
And good luck
with that.

15:49.426 --> 15:51.559
Thank you.

15:51.646 --> 15:54.301
Are you thinking
what I'm thinking?

15:58.522 --> 16:00.350
Gabriel,
you got a sec?

16:00.437 --> 16:01.873
Not if you're gonna
snap my head off.

16:01.961 --> 16:03.919
I'm really sorry
about that.

16:04.006 --> 16:05.573
I was having
a bad day, and...

16:05.660 --> 16:06.661
I didn't mean to take
it out on you.

16:06.748 --> 16:09.359
You don't deserve that.

16:09.446 --> 16:11.927
I miss you, too.

16:13.450 --> 16:14.669
Uh... no.

16:14.756 --> 16:16.149
That's not where
I'm going with this.

16:16.236 --> 16:18.412
I want to hold you
so much right now.

16:18.499 --> 16:20.892
I'm trying to apologize,

16:20.980 --> 16:22.329
not turn you on.

16:22.416 --> 16:23.547
Too late.

16:25.941 --> 16:28.161
Gabriel, listen to me.

16:28.248 --> 16:29.640
You and I are done.

16:29.727 --> 16:31.686
Over.

16:31.773 --> 16:33.383
Finito.

16:44.394 --> 16:44.525
Excuse me. Miss?

16:46.701 --> 16:48.964
[speaks quietly]

16:56.450 --> 16:57.625
I'm not sure
if you remember me...

16:57.712 --> 17:01.150
I remember.

17:01.237 --> 17:02.543
Yeah, I bet you do.

17:02.630 --> 17:04.284
I want to apologize.

17:04.371 --> 17:06.286
Your job's tough enough
without some jerk like me

17:06.373 --> 17:07.026
telling you to smile.

17:07.113 --> 17:09.637
Seriously?

17:09.723 --> 17:11.551
Yeah, it's really
been eating at me.

17:11.638 --> 17:13.597
I-I hope you'll
accept my apology.

17:16.470 --> 17:17.645
Yes.

17:17.732 --> 17:18.646
I do.

17:18.733 --> 17:20.865
Thanks so much.

17:20.952 --> 17:22.563
You've really made my day.

17:22.650 --> 17:24.652
Great.

17:24.739 --> 17:26.480
Have a nice lunch.

17:28.786 --> 17:31.441
I so wish I hadn't
spit in his latte.

17:35.315 --> 17:36.577
Hi, Marjorie.

17:36.664 --> 17:39.058
Ah, there she is.

17:39.145 --> 17:40.668
I just wanted
to thank you

17:40.755 --> 17:42.365
for talking to me
the other day.

17:42.452 --> 17:43.888
Your advice
really helped.

17:43.975 --> 17:44.889
Oh, yeah?

17:44.976 --> 17:45.977
Yeah.

17:46.065 --> 17:47.675
Once I let go
of my anger,

17:47.762 --> 17:48.850
everyone suddenly
got nicer.

17:48.937 --> 17:49.851
Aw.

17:49.938 --> 17:51.113
Good for you.

17:51.200 --> 17:52.419
Anger is a luxury

17:52.506 --> 17:54.116
people like us
cannot afford.

17:54.203 --> 17:55.335
Hi, sweetie.

17:55.422 --> 17:56.553
Hi, Mom.

18:00.035 --> 18:01.515
Do you two
know each other?

18:02.603 --> 18:04.518
We've, uh...

18:04.605 --> 18:05.954
crossed paths.

18:07.869 --> 18:10.567
Hello, Marjorie.

18:10.654 --> 18:11.655
Bonnie.

18:14.876 --> 18:16.312
Marjorie made cookies.

18:16.399 --> 18:18.358
Thanks for
the warning.

18:21.665 --> 18:22.710
Good-bye, Marjorie.

18:22.797 --> 18:23.798
Bonnie.

18:28.019 --> 18:28.933
That's your mother?

18:29.020 --> 18:29.891
Yeah.

18:29.978 --> 18:32.937
No wonder you drank.

18:43.948 --> 18:45.341
Uh...

18:47.126 --> 18:48.953
Excuse me, could I talk
to you for second?

18:49.040 --> 18:52.305
Look, lady, I don't
want any problems.

18:52.392 --> 18:53.610
No, no, no.

18:53.697 --> 18:54.959
I came here to apologize.

18:55.046 --> 18:58.180
I was very rude the other day.

18:58.267 --> 18:59.747
Oh.

18:59.834 --> 19:02.663
Anyway, there's no excuse
for it, but, um...

19:02.750 --> 19:04.360
once again, I'm sorry.

19:04.447 --> 19:06.145
Wow, I've been
working here six years

19:06.232 --> 19:07.450
and this has
never happened.

19:08.886 --> 19:10.192
[choked up]:
People come in,

19:10.279 --> 19:11.454
they just treat you
like you're nothing,

19:11.541 --> 19:13.108
and then...

19:13.195 --> 19:14.849
go about their business,

19:14.936 --> 19:17.982
buying cotton balls
and tube socks.

19:18.069 --> 19:22.073
Well, you do get a lot of
tube sock for your money here.

19:22.161 --> 19:25.773
But you came back
to apologize.

19:25.860 --> 19:27.601
To be fair,

19:27.688 --> 19:29.733
I also needed toenail clippers.

19:29.820 --> 19:31.039
It doesn't matter.

19:31.126 --> 19:33.128
Thank you.

19:35.217 --> 19:37.785
Okay. Okay.

19:38.481 --> 19:40.657
Geoff...

19:41.919 --> 19:43.965
Hey...

19:44.052 --> 19:45.401
can I use your
bathroom now?

19:45.488 --> 19:47.664
Please don't exploit
our friendship.
