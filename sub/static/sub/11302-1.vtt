[dog barking]

01:28.607 --> 01:29.816
[Beau] Rooster, you home?

01:29.899 --> 01:31.693
[Rooster] Yes, sir. Living room!

01:31.776 --> 01:33.361
I thought you were gonna
take a look at that tractor

01:33.444 --> 01:34.445
and try and see what was...

01:34.528 --> 01:36.030
Check it out. [sighs]

01:36.114 --> 01:37.616
Colt's home.

01:38.700 --> 01:40.493
What the hell are you doing here?

01:40.576 --> 01:44.122
I thought you were up in Canada
playing amateur's football.

01:44.205 --> 01:47.917
Uh, semi-pro. Yeah, I was playing
for the Saskatoon Cold.

01:48.001 --> 01:50.629
It's like the Miami Heat, except...

01:50.712 --> 01:51.963
you know, cold.

01:53.590 --> 01:55.258
Yeah, we know.

01:55.341 --> 01:56.593
We also heard you got arrested

01:56.676 --> 01:59.679
for flashing Shania Twain
while you were up there.

02:01.097 --> 02:02.891
[scoffs] How'd you even hear about that?

02:02.974 --> 02:04.726
[chuckles] It was in the paper.

02:04.809 --> 02:08.937
"Former high school phenom
Colt Bennett shows Shania his Twain."

02:12.400 --> 02:15.528
First time you made the front page
since the state finals.

02:15.612 --> 02:17.155
I put it on the fridge.

02:18.114 --> 02:19.157
All right, listen to this.

02:19.240 --> 02:23.662
I... They got this hotel up there
made entirely of ice, okay?

02:24.412 --> 02:26.665
And so, I'm a little drunk, and I...

02:26.748 --> 02:30.669
and I see this sweet ice sculpture
of Wayne Gretzky.

02:30.752 --> 02:34.213
And naturally, I think,
I could take a wizz on him.

02:35.757 --> 02:37.008
It's like when you go
to the fancy restaurant

02:37.091 --> 02:38.467
and they put the ice in the pisser.

02:38.551 --> 02:40.219
You know, you get to spray it up
and melt it down.

02:40.303 --> 02:41.345
[Colt chuckles] Yeah.

02:41.429 --> 02:44.933
So, I'm taking a piss
in The Great One's mouth.

02:45.016 --> 02:48.144
And I almost got a hole all the way
through the back of his head.

02:50.396 --> 02:51.647
He shoots, he scores.

02:51.731 --> 02:53.066
[chuckles]

02:54.192 --> 02:55.401
When I slip...

02:56.485 --> 02:59.781
Bam! I slide balls first
into Miss Shania Twain.

03:01.574 --> 03:04.577
Did she look down and say,
"That don't impress me much"?

03:07.413 --> 03:10.666
No. She said,
"That makes me feel like a woman."

03:14.295 --> 03:15.755
What are you doing here?

03:16.589 --> 03:19.968
What? Can't just stop in
and say hi to my family?

03:20.051 --> 03:22.261
I remember last time you stopped by.

03:22.345 --> 03:24.889
Said you were done with football.

03:24.973 --> 03:27.266
You wanted to start
helping out around here.

03:28.267 --> 03:29.853
How long ago was that, Rooster?

03:29.936 --> 03:31.604
About six years?

03:31.687 --> 03:33.732
Yes, sir. It was on my birthday.

03:33.815 --> 03:36.609
We were all supposed to go to dinner
but you guys just fought the whole time.

03:36.693 --> 03:39.696
Hey, I got ten bucks anyone
in here knows how old I am.

03:42.866 --> 03:45.702
Then you snuck out of here
in the middle of the night.

03:45.785 --> 03:46.953
Took your brother's truck.

03:47.036 --> 03:49.998
- Left the damn gate open.
- Okay, that wasn't my fault.

03:50.081 --> 03:53.084
Rooster was chasing after me yelling,
"That's my truck!"

03:53.167 --> 03:56.713
And so, I just assumed
he was gonna close it.

03:57.546 --> 03:59.382
Our cows were all over town.

04:00.299 --> 04:02.927
I found one of 'em standing
in the Sizzler parking lot

04:03.011 --> 04:05.388
just staring at a poster of a rib-eye.

04:11.310 --> 04:12.436
I'm 35.

04:19.317 --> 04:21.445
What the fuck's on your feet?

04:26.868 --> 04:27.952
They're boots.

04:28.619 --> 04:30.246
Those are not boots.

04:31.372 --> 04:32.540
They're Uggs.

04:33.707 --> 04:35.752
That's Australian for "boots."

04:37.545 --> 04:39.798
They're ladies' shoes.

04:41.340 --> 04:43.551
Well, Tom Brady wears 'em.

04:43.634 --> 04:46.387
Yeah, well, Tom Brady
gets away with a lot of shit.

04:49.140 --> 04:51.350
Fine. You know what? That's...

04:51.434 --> 04:53.394
You made fun of my clothes,

04:53.477 --> 04:56.480
you made fun of my career,
you made fun of my childhood.

04:56.564 --> 04:58.149
You got anything else
you wanna take a shot at?

04:58.232 --> 05:00.109
That's a stupid haircut.

05:00.193 --> 05:02.946
All right. You know what?

05:03.029 --> 05:04.197
This was a bad idea.

05:04.280 --> 05:05.990
I can't stay here with him,
he's impossible.

05:06.074 --> 05:07.325
Same old Colt,

05:07.408 --> 05:09.911
"I can't stay here, he's impossible."

05:09.994 --> 05:12.997
"I can't stay in this school,
the coach won't let me start."

05:13.081 --> 05:16.542
"I can't stay with this girl.
She doesn't like it when I cheat on her."

05:16.625 --> 05:18.294
Well, speaking of women
who don't like being cheated on,

05:18.377 --> 05:19.462
how's Mom doing?

05:20.421 --> 05:23.007
All right, this is getting good.

05:23.091 --> 05:24.258
I'm gonna grab a beer.

05:24.342 --> 05:25.802
No punches till I get back.

05:28.429 --> 05:31.474
Don't go making accusations
when you don't know the whole story.

05:31.557 --> 05:32.892
Oh, really?

05:32.976 --> 05:34.768
What's the whole story, Dad?

05:34.853 --> 05:36.812
That's none of your damn business.

05:36.896 --> 05:39.023
There we go. There we go.

05:39.107 --> 05:40.108
Why are you here?

05:40.191 --> 05:41.692
I got a tryout...

05:41.775 --> 05:44.320
with a new semi-pro team in Denver.

05:44.403 --> 05:46.614
And I just need a place to stay
for a couple days.

05:46.697 --> 05:48.449
As soon as I make the team,
I'm out of here.

05:49.325 --> 05:50.952
Are you kiddin' me?

05:51.035 --> 05:52.996
Are you still chasing this dream?

05:53.079 --> 05:54.663
I'm a football player.

05:54.747 --> 05:57.708
You're not a football player, Colt.

05:57.791 --> 06:01.129
You're a guy dreamin'
about being a football player.

06:01.212 --> 06:02.463
You're 34.

06:02.546 --> 06:04.840
Oh, sure, you know how old he is.

06:07.510 --> 06:10.638
Uh, 34 is still young to be a quarterback.

06:10.721 --> 06:12.932
That's your three concussions talking.

06:13.016 --> 06:15.726
[scoffs] I don't remember
three concussions.

06:17.395 --> 06:19.147
You know, has it ever crossed your mind

06:19.230 --> 06:21.690
that you might not be right
about everything?

06:21.774 --> 06:25.403
'Cause you were just as sure
when you said the moon landing was fake.

06:25.486 --> 06:28.822
A flag cannot ripple
in the vacuum of space.

06:29.865 --> 06:31.910
Well, you're wrong about me.

06:31.993 --> 06:34.870
I can still make it.
I just need a chance.

06:34.954 --> 06:37.165
Every opportunity you've had...

06:37.248 --> 06:40.834
I'm talking about high school,
college, and the pros...

06:40.919 --> 06:45.006
you've either smoked it or drank it
or screwed it away.

06:46.340 --> 06:47.841
Well, next time it'll be different.

06:47.926 --> 06:49.969
They ought to put that on your tombstone.

06:50.053 --> 06:52.305
"Here lies Colt Bennett.

06:52.388 --> 06:54.140
Next time it'll be different.

06:54.223 --> 06:56.935
He died wearing lady boots."

07:01.730 --> 07:02.898
[indistinct chatter]

07:02.982 --> 07:06.069
Seriously? I can't even
shut a truck door right?

07:06.152 --> 07:07.653
I'm sure you could.

07:07.736 --> 07:10.406
Why you choose not to is beyond me.

07:11.490 --> 07:13.076
Hey, I'm gonna hit the head.

07:13.159 --> 07:15.244
But in case you guys
run out of things to fight about...

07:15.869 --> 07:17.956
Colt's jeans cost 85 bucks.

07:21.167 --> 07:24.921
What kind of dipshit pays 85 bucks
for a pair of jeans?

07:25.588 --> 07:26.589
My work is done.

07:29.508 --> 07:30.551
Hey, bartender...

07:30.634 --> 07:33.137
can we get a couple of cold ones, please?

07:33.221 --> 07:35.098
Not a chance, Beau.

07:35.181 --> 07:36.765
Not even for your favorite son?

07:36.849 --> 07:38.101
Colt?

07:38.184 --> 07:39.227
[laughs] Hi, Mama.

07:39.310 --> 07:41.145
Don't you "Hi, Mama" me.
Give me a hug.

07:41.229 --> 07:42.480
- Aw! [grunting]
- [squeals]

07:42.563 --> 07:44.065
You're a sight for sore eyes.

07:44.148 --> 07:47.901
Especially now since you cut your hair
and shaved off that stupid goatee.

07:47.986 --> 07:49.570
Oh, no. That was a playoff beard.

07:50.613 --> 07:51.990
You know I can't grow here.

07:53.657 --> 07:55.159
You ready for your tryout?

07:55.243 --> 07:57.078
You knew about this?

07:57.161 --> 08:01.040
Yeah, I stay in touch with my son.
You should try it.

08:01.582 --> 08:03.334
Can we just get those beers?

08:03.417 --> 08:06.295
You have any complaints about the service,
take it up with the owner.

08:06.379 --> 08:08.714
The owner's kind of a pain in my ass.

08:09.715 --> 08:13.011
That's why the owner lives
in her own Airstream now.

08:16.680 --> 08:18.016
What time you leaving tomorrow?

08:18.099 --> 08:19.808
Oh, early. Tryout's at 2:00.

08:19.892 --> 08:21.685
About the time I'll be getting a beer.

08:24.147 --> 08:26.857
Once you're on that team,
I'll make the drive every Sunday.

08:26.940 --> 08:28.817
Oh, uh, the games aren't on Sunday.

08:28.901 --> 08:32.030
Sunday's reserved for
the high school girls' lacrosse team.

08:35.573 --> 08:39.078
Phew! I just had me one of them
pees that's better than sex.

08:40.453 --> 08:42.248
You know, a pee-gasm.

08:43.374 --> 08:46.085
You know, it's possible
you're not having sex right.

08:47.170 --> 08:49.713
Well, it's also possible
you're not peeing right.

08:51.507 --> 08:54.343
- Hey, Ma, could you grab me a beer?
- Sure, darlin'.

08:54.427 --> 08:57.221
Hank, I'll give you five bucks
for that beer.

08:59.140 --> 09:00.266
Done.

09:01.225 --> 09:02.518
Cheers, Maggie.

09:03.852 --> 09:05.771
Come on. Let's grab a table.

09:05.854 --> 09:08.066
Oh, yeah, good, just the two of us.

09:09.192 --> 09:11.069
Sit and talk for a while.

09:12.653 --> 09:13.737
Would you like a beer?

09:13.821 --> 09:16.324
Ma, I got a tryout tomorrow.
Make it a whiskey.

09:17.450 --> 09:19.868
- You look good, Ma.
- I'm all right.

09:20.578 --> 09:23.706
I got my health,
the bar keeps me pretty busy

09:23.789 --> 09:27.376
and it's filled with a bunch of drunk guys
I can take advantage of if I want to.

09:27.460 --> 09:29.420
You can start with me.

09:31.089 --> 09:33.882
I said, "If I want to," Hank.

09:35.468 --> 09:37.845
- How's it going with your dad?
- Hmm.

09:37.928 --> 09:40.389
Remember how he reacted
when Obama got elected?

09:41.849 --> 09:42.975
It was worse than that.

09:45.394 --> 09:47.020
Stupid question.

09:49.107 --> 09:50.274
What the fuck's on your feet?

09:54.612 --> 09:56.114
Tom Brady wears 'em.

09:56.197 --> 09:59.075
Looks like Marcia Brady wears 'em.

10:01.869 --> 10:04.122
All right, give this to your brother.

10:04.205 --> 10:06.874
And don't touch any of the waitresses.

10:06.957 --> 10:08.959
Hey, Alicia came on to me.

10:09.042 --> 10:10.919
She saved a horse and rode a cowboy.

10:15.549 --> 10:17.135
Aren't you Colt Bennett?

10:17.218 --> 10:18.969
- Do you work here?
- No.

10:19.052 --> 10:20.388
Then yes, I am.

10:20.471 --> 10:21.930
[chuckles]

10:24.350 --> 10:25.601
[both breathing heavily]

10:25.684 --> 10:28.146
[exhales] I can't believe
I'm in Colt Bennett's bedroom.

10:28.687 --> 10:30.063
I can't believe I'm here, either.

10:30.148 --> 10:31.815
[chuckles]

10:31.899 --> 10:33.317
How old were you in that picture?

10:33.401 --> 10:35.444
Uh, that was high school.

10:35.528 --> 10:36.737
So, uh, 17?

10:36.820 --> 10:38.114
You were really hot.

10:38.197 --> 10:39.240
- [grunts]
- [gasps]

10:39.323 --> 10:40.949
- Duh.
- [chuckles]

10:41.950 --> 10:43.911
Is that your national championship ring?

10:43.994 --> 10:45.704
Yep. Florida State. '99.

10:45.788 --> 10:47.956
Wow. 1999.

10:48.040 --> 10:49.792
I was six. [chuckles]

10:49.875 --> 10:51.460
Oh, '99...

10:51.544 --> 10:55.005
So that'd make you born in '93.

10:55.088 --> 10:58.091
Carry the one.
And that would make you 24?

10:58.176 --> 10:59.968
- I'm 22.
- [scoffs] Even better.

11:00.052 --> 11:01.179
[chuckles]

11:02.388 --> 11:05.098
I'm about to have sex with
a national championship quarterback.

11:05.183 --> 11:07.935
Uh, the backup to the backup quarterback.

11:08.018 --> 11:10.771
You know, now seems like
a bad time to be honest.

11:10.854 --> 11:13.524
Wait. Backup?
But you were the best ever.

11:13.607 --> 11:15.734
Yeah, the coach had it out
for me from day one.

11:15.818 --> 11:18.862
- Why?
- 'Cause I didn't show up till day three.

11:20.198 --> 11:22.366
And I slept with his daughter
on day four. But...

11:22.450 --> 11:24.577
- [knock on door]
- [Beau] Colt.

11:24.660 --> 11:26.370
She's 22!

11:27.455 --> 11:29.290
Hi, Mr. Bennett.

11:30.916 --> 11:32.876
Dad, this is Heather.

11:32.960 --> 11:35.421
I know Heather.
How's your mom?

11:35.504 --> 11:38.048
She's good. She says, "Hey."

11:38.131 --> 11:39.967
She's a fine woman.

11:40.050 --> 11:41.427
Top-notch bowler.

11:41.510 --> 11:43.679
Put your clothes on, I need a hand.

11:43.762 --> 11:45.055
Wha... seriously?

11:45.138 --> 11:48.058
One of the cow's water just broke
and she's calling your name.

11:48.141 --> 11:49.560
Let's go. Heather...

11:50.603 --> 11:51.979
good seeing you.

11:52.062 --> 11:54.064
Tell your mom Beau says "Hey" back.

11:54.147 --> 11:55.858
[Heather chuckles]

11:56.484 --> 11:58.277
[grunts] Sorry.

12:00.404 --> 12:02.865
Oh, actually, those are my Uggs.

12:07.245 --> 12:09.121
- How's she doin'?
- It's a breech.

12:09.204 --> 12:10.373
Oh, damn it.

12:10.456 --> 12:12.207
All right, Colt.
Get over here and wash your arm.

12:12.291 --> 12:13.292
What?

12:13.376 --> 12:15.544
[stammers] Why do I got to
put my arm in her?

12:15.628 --> 12:16.670
Why can't Rooster do it?

12:16.754 --> 12:18.256
Because he's not good at it.

12:18.339 --> 12:20.048
[sighs] Of course I'm good at it.

12:20.132 --> 12:22.551
Last time, you lost your watch in there.

12:23.511 --> 12:25.012
Who cares? It's waterproof.

12:26.847 --> 12:28.599
- Come on, Colt. Hustle it up.
- I'm coming.

12:28.682 --> 12:31.435
God, wait, why can't you hook her up
and I'll just pull the rope?

12:31.519 --> 12:35.731
You know, that's the beauty of having
somebody beggin' for a place to stay.

12:35.814 --> 12:37.358
You can't ask 'em to pay rent,

12:37.441 --> 12:40.110
but you can ask 'em to stick
their arm up a cow's address.

12:40.193 --> 12:41.194
So, come on.

12:42.738 --> 12:44.072
[Colt] All right, Carla.

12:44.156 --> 12:47.159
- [Carla mooing]
- Here we go, girl. You're gonna be fine.

12:47.242 --> 12:49.703
You don't have to make love to her,

12:49.787 --> 12:53.206
just get the calf out of there
so we can raise it and slaughter it.

12:53.957 --> 12:55.543
[grunting] Ew! Forgot how warm it is.

12:56.627 --> 12:58.587
- All right, I got her legs.
- [Beau] Good.

12:58.671 --> 13:00.298
Feet will be right at the end of those.

13:00.381 --> 13:02.633
Thank you, I know what I'm doing.

13:02.716 --> 13:04.343
God, do I look like an idiot?

13:04.427 --> 13:08.347
Well, you're shoulder-deep in a cow
and ankle-deep in her shit, so...

13:09.848 --> 13:11.099
Man, my Uggs.

13:12.184 --> 13:14.728
Hey, if you feel a Timex up in there,
grab it for me, huh?

13:16.063 --> 13:18.982
You know what? You can't see it,
but I'm flippin' you the bird right now.

13:19.942 --> 13:21.610
All right, one loop for each foot.

13:21.694 --> 13:22.861
- Come on.
- Yeah, I got it!

13:22.945 --> 13:25.280
Oh, you got it?
Well then start pulling!

13:25.364 --> 13:27.366
You know, did it ever occur to you

13:27.450 --> 13:30.869
to encourage me instead of
riding me all the time?

13:30.953 --> 13:33.706
If I rode you, it was 'cause you were
the only one in this family

13:33.789 --> 13:35.791
that had any smarts or talent.

13:35.874 --> 13:37.418
Standing right here, Dad.

13:38.210 --> 13:40.379
I'm aware of that, Jameson.

13:40.463 --> 13:41.755
[Carla mooing]

13:41.839 --> 13:45.050
We all sacrificed
so you had a chance to succeed.

13:45.133 --> 13:46.969
But you weren't willing to work for it.

13:47.052 --> 13:48.136
So, here we are!

13:48.220 --> 13:50.598
You know, where do you get off
being so high and mighty

13:50.681 --> 13:52.600
when you can barely pay
the bills around here?

13:52.683 --> 13:54.477
Who told you that?

13:56.269 --> 13:58.606
I'm allowed to say things.
I'm a person.

14:00.524 --> 14:02.150
I'm gonna go hang out with Heather.

14:06.113 --> 14:08.657
So, is it true?
You in trouble?

14:08.741 --> 14:11.577
It's not my fault.
It's that other bastard.

14:11.660 --> 14:13.871
- What other bastard?
- God.

14:13.954 --> 14:17.249
There hasn't been a decent rain
around here in over a year.

14:17.332 --> 14:20.293
It's hard to raise grass-fed cattle
when there's no grass.

14:20.378 --> 14:22.921
[stammers] That ain't God, Dad,
that's global warming.

14:23.005 --> 14:25.924
Global warming's a bunch of crap
Al Gore made up

14:26.008 --> 14:28.260
to sell books to Californians.

14:29.470 --> 14:30.971
Besides, what do you care?

14:31.639 --> 14:34.307
You haven't been around this family
the last 15 years.

14:34.392 --> 14:36.935
Yeah. Why do you think I left, Dad?
Because of you.

14:37.019 --> 14:38.604
Well, why are you here now?

14:38.687 --> 14:39.897
Oh, that's right,

14:39.980 --> 14:41.440
you got no place else to go!

14:41.524 --> 14:42.650
Go to hell!

14:46.319 --> 14:48.113
Ah, it ain't breathing.

14:48.196 --> 14:50.658
Hell, I'll get the epinephrine.

14:50.741 --> 14:52.075
I'll give her CPR.

14:52.159 --> 14:54.077
That's not gonna work.

14:54.161 --> 14:55.954
Damn, this is the last thing I need.

14:56.038 --> 14:57.039
[blowing]

14:57.122 --> 14:58.707
You're wasting your time.

14:58.791 --> 15:00.250
[calf mooing]

15:02.252 --> 15:03.504
[grunts]

15:05.172 --> 15:06.757
Wasting my time.

15:06.840 --> 15:08.801
Well, it worked. He's up.

15:08.884 --> 15:10.469
I'll be damned.

15:13.096 --> 15:14.222
Come here, buddy.

15:21.939 --> 15:25.943
Rooster, we are the proud parents
of a beautiful 85-pound boy.

15:27.194 --> 15:29.988
It was incredible.
That calf was born still.

15:30.072 --> 15:33.116
I gave it CPR
and I brought it back to life.

15:33.992 --> 15:35.869
[chuckles] Wow, Colt.

15:35.953 --> 15:38.288
You had your arm up a cow
and made out with a calf.

15:39.582 --> 15:43.251
You know, you diddle a chicken,
you're in the farmer's Hall of Fame.

15:44.628 --> 15:48.090
I'm gonna go back out and check on him,
make sure that calf is sucking.

15:48.173 --> 15:49.174
Colt...

15:50.634 --> 15:51.719
good job.

15:57.182 --> 15:59.309
- Did he just...
- Yeah. He just said, "Good job."

15:59.392 --> 16:02.354
And then I think he felt nauseous
and went outside to get some air.

16:06.775 --> 16:08.444
I think the last time
he told me "good job"

16:08.527 --> 16:10.446
was when I learned how to walk.

16:11.279 --> 16:13.115
I think his exact words were...

16:13.198 --> 16:14.533
"Jesus, finally."

16:17.536 --> 16:19.622
You know what you should do
to really mess with him?

16:19.705 --> 16:22.249
Go outside, look him straight in the eye,
and say...

16:23.333 --> 16:24.627
"I love you, big fella."

16:26.629 --> 16:29.214
Yeah, then you can go tell him
you're a Democrat. [chuckles]

16:29.297 --> 16:30.716
[both laughing]

16:31.717 --> 16:32.926
Oh, God.

16:33.010 --> 16:34.803
I don't think washing helped at all.

16:34.887 --> 16:36.805
Yeah, that smell never really goes away.

16:36.889 --> 16:38.348
You know, my advice is

16:38.431 --> 16:41.143
when it comes to putting
body parts into livestock,

16:41.226 --> 16:42.686
you always wanna use the same arm.

16:42.770 --> 16:46.982
This one... is for pregnant cows
and constipated horses.

16:47.065 --> 16:49.735
This one for eatin',
whistlin' and shakin' hands.

16:49.818 --> 16:51.904
Unless I don't like the guy,
and then I use this one.

16:54.114 --> 16:57.450
Yeah, that was not the vagina
I thought I'd be in tonight.

16:59.119 --> 17:00.579
You know, all in all, it was a good day.

17:01.914 --> 17:04.290
Even prison's fun
when you're just visitin'.

17:04.374 --> 17:05.917
You get to talk on that phone.

17:06.001 --> 17:08.671
Lady next to you puts
her boobies up against the glass.

17:08.753 --> 17:10.213
[Colt chuckles]

17:10.297 --> 17:12.715
If it's so bad here,
why don't you just leave?

17:14.300 --> 17:15.553
You're kidding, right?

17:17.054 --> 17:19.181
After you left,
that wasn't much of an option.

17:19.263 --> 17:21.391
Dad needed someone here
to help him run the ranch.

17:22.309 --> 17:23.602
So you felt like you were stuck?

17:25.771 --> 17:27.230
Well, you must think I'm...

17:27.314 --> 17:30.358
Spoiled? Selfish? Irresponsible?
Kind of a wuss?

17:32.069 --> 17:34.446
Okay. I was gonna say "selfish" but...

17:34.530 --> 17:37.032
Conceited? Stubborn?
Full-blown alcoholic?

17:38.408 --> 17:39.702
But... [sighs]

17:39.785 --> 17:42.621
you were a hell of a football player.
And you had to go.

17:43.831 --> 17:45.415
I was proud of you.

17:45.498 --> 17:47.042
You're my little brother, <i>amigo</i>.

17:49.169 --> 17:50.170
Thank you.

17:51.504 --> 17:53.090
You know, I'm proud of you, too.

17:53.173 --> 17:55.383
[scoffs softly]
Yeah? For what?

18:00.848 --> 18:04.517
You know, I really didn't think there was
gonna be a follow-up question.

18:04.602 --> 18:07.354
All right. Well, I'm gonna go outside
and help Dad with Carla.

18:07.437 --> 18:08.731
Unless, of course, you want to?

18:08.814 --> 18:09.857
Oh, no. You do it.

18:09.940 --> 18:12.150
I can't make eye contact
with her for a while.

18:21.368 --> 18:22.410
Mom?

18:22.494 --> 18:23.996
Oh, hey, Colt.

18:26.707 --> 18:28.709
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

18:28.792 --> 18:30.002
What are you doing here?

18:30.836 --> 18:31.879
Your father.

18:33.797 --> 18:35.132
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

18:36.884 --> 18:38.218
You and Dad still...

18:38.301 --> 18:40.345
Every time I see your father, we fight.

18:40.428 --> 18:42.180
And every time we fight, we end up f...

18:42.264 --> 18:43.641
All right! All right!

18:44.767 --> 18:45.851
I got it.

18:45.934 --> 18:49.605
Oh, if it helps,
we weren't facing each other.

18:53.942 --> 18:56.319
No, that does not help at all!

18:57.821 --> 19:00.323
- Do you want some coffee?
- Sure.

19:01.950 --> 19:03.952
Oh, man. [sniffs] Whoa!

19:05.162 --> 19:06.329
What are you doing?

19:06.413 --> 19:10.042
Oh, Carla had a breech birth last night.
So I had to stick my arm up her...

19:10.125 --> 19:11.919
Got it.

19:12.002 --> 19:14.421
If it helps, we weren't facing each other.

19:18.550 --> 19:19.592
That's cute.

19:19.677 --> 19:21.511
Soap and water won't do it.

19:21.594 --> 19:24.973
Need some Tabasco, tomato juice,
a stalk of celery and vodka.

19:25.724 --> 19:26.725
That's a bloody Mary.

19:26.809 --> 19:29.812
Right, you have four of those,
you won't care how your arm smells.

19:34.692 --> 19:36.193
You ready for your tryout?

19:36.276 --> 19:39.697
[inhales deeply] Yeah, I think so.
I'm a little nervous.

19:39.780 --> 19:42.658
Well, that's good, right?
It means you still care.

19:44.785 --> 19:47.913
How about I make you that pre-game pasta
you used to like?

19:47.996 --> 19:50.874
[chuckles] Thanks, Mom,
I'm not a kid anymore.

19:50.958 --> 19:54.169
How about a pancake
with a whipped-cream face?

19:55.295 --> 19:57.214
Oh, yes, please. [chuckles]

20:01.719 --> 20:05.681
Blue skies.
God, I never thought I'd hate blue skies.

20:06.598 --> 20:09.059
You know, I don't think
it's rained here since you left.

20:09.142 --> 20:12.270
Yeah. Dad told me it's been
kinda rough around here.

20:12.354 --> 20:15.440
"Kinda"?
You up to speed on everything here?

20:16.149 --> 20:18.777
- Well, obviously not.
- [sighs]

20:20.403 --> 20:22.823
This is the worst year
that anybody can remember.

20:22.906 --> 20:26.159
I mean... [sighs]
he even had to let Pedro go.

20:27.911 --> 20:30.413
Wait. So, it's just him and Rooster?

20:30.497 --> 20:33.291
Oh... wait.
He's not gonna lose this place, is he?

20:33.375 --> 20:34.417
I mean, that'll kill him.

20:34.501 --> 20:37.129
No. Keeping this place is killin' him.

20:37.212 --> 20:41.008
He's been out there for hours already.
He hardly ever sleeps.

20:42.592 --> 20:43.802
[sighs]

20:44.887 --> 20:45.971
Sorry...

20:46.679 --> 20:48.598
can't put the face on the pancake.

20:48.681 --> 20:51.226
Your father and I used
all the whipped cream up last night.

20:51.309 --> 20:52.685
[Colt sighs]

20:57.190 --> 20:58.358
[shudders]

21:05.824 --> 21:08.243
- Looked good out there, Bennett.
- Oh, hey, thanks.

21:08.326 --> 21:11.454
Yeah. Just taking it one play at a time.

21:11.538 --> 21:13.040
Figure if I give it 110%...

21:13.123 --> 21:14.875
Cut the crap.
This isn't a press conference.

21:15.708 --> 21:17.460
How's the shoulder?

21:17.544 --> 21:19.254
Yeah, it's a little sore.

21:19.337 --> 21:23.175
Nothing three Vicodin and a couple of
shots of whiskey can't take care of, huh?

21:23.258 --> 21:24.301
Funny.

21:24.384 --> 21:26.178
Yes, that was a joke.

21:28.889 --> 21:30.891
[sighs] Think you can make it
through a whole season?

21:30.974 --> 21:33.601
I can if it means
you got a spot for me.

21:33.685 --> 21:35.062
You're Colt Bennett.

21:35.145 --> 21:36.646
In these parts, you're still a big deal.

21:36.729 --> 21:38.606
Nothing else, you'll sell tickets.

21:38.690 --> 21:43.653
And by that, I mean every player has to
sell at least ten tickets per home game.

21:44.737 --> 21:45.781
What's the starting salary?

21:45.864 --> 21:48.909
Two hundred and fifty a game.
You start, it's a bonus of 50.

21:48.992 --> 21:51.119
If we win, you get another 50.

21:51.203 --> 21:53.914
Are you kidding? I got paid
more than that for playing in college.

21:53.997 --> 21:55.582
[chuckles] Another good one.

21:55.665 --> 21:57.835
Yes, that was also a joke.

21:59.920 --> 22:03.298
Look, I know it's not the big time,
but the quality of play is pretty decent.

22:03.381 --> 22:06.134
And occasionally NFL scouts
do come to these games.

22:06.218 --> 22:07.469
It's a long shot...

22:07.552 --> 22:08.595
Yeah, no, I get it.

22:08.678 --> 22:11.348
You can't win the lotto
if you don't buy a ticket, right?

22:11.431 --> 22:12.682
That's the attitude.

22:12.765 --> 22:15.227
First practice, Wednesday at 11:00.

22:16.103 --> 22:19.064
Extra 15 bucks if you come early
and line the field.

22:19.147 --> 22:21.774
[chuckles] Oh, thanks.

22:22.609 --> 22:23.819
Can't wait!

22:24.652 --> 22:25.653
[grunts softly]

22:26.571 --> 22:28.823
[sniffs] Oh, damn, Carla.

22:36.498 --> 22:40.293
Yeah, it needs a new head gasket.
All right, I'll order one online.

22:40.377 --> 22:42.545
No. We'll go over
to Henderson's to get one.

22:42.629 --> 22:44.714
If they don't have it,
we'll go someplace else.

22:45.673 --> 22:48.218
No, Amazon will have it here in 24 hours.

22:48.301 --> 22:50.888
See? That's what's wrong
with your generation.

22:50.971 --> 22:53.765
Oh, good.
I was wondering what's wrong with us.

22:54.975 --> 22:56.809
You're a bunch of lazy bastards.

22:56.894 --> 22:58.353
You never wanna leave the house.

22:58.436 --> 23:01.982
What're you gonna do when North Korea
comes knocking on the door?

23:02.065 --> 23:03.901
You gonna order a gun on Amazon?

23:03.984 --> 23:07.195
No, I'm gonna go to
the gun rack in the truck...

23:07.279 --> 23:10.282
or the gun rack next to the fridge,
or the gun rack in the bathroom,

23:10.365 --> 23:12.867
or the second gun rack in the bathroom.

23:14.452 --> 23:16.579
- Hey.
- [Rooster] Hey, how'd it go?

23:16.663 --> 23:17.998
Yeah, it could've gone better.

23:18.081 --> 23:19.791
What do you mean
"It could've gone better"?

23:19.874 --> 23:20.959
[drops bag]

23:21.919 --> 23:22.920
I mean I didn't make it.

23:24.587 --> 23:25.923
Damn, Colt. I'm sorry.

23:26.798 --> 23:27.966
You know what you could do?

23:28.050 --> 23:30.468
Strap on those Uggs
and try out for cheerleader.

23:31.719 --> 23:32.804
Screw you.

23:32.887 --> 23:34.056
[chuckles]

23:34.139 --> 23:35.182
So...

23:35.265 --> 23:37.684
anyway, I don't know what
my next step's gonna be but...

23:38.977 --> 23:41.854
I thought, if it's all right with you,
I could stick around here for a while.

23:42.981 --> 23:43.982
You're serious?

23:44.942 --> 23:46.026
Yeah.

23:46.944 --> 23:50.280
Guess you were right.
I'm done with football.

23:50.363 --> 23:53.700
Wow, I didn't realize
I'd raised a quitter.

23:55.368 --> 23:56.369
Really?

23:57.245 --> 23:59.622
You've been telling me
to give it up for years.

23:59.706 --> 24:02.250
You've got no sense of humor at all.

24:04.377 --> 24:06.338
Look, for what it's worth...

24:07.047 --> 24:09.299
I'd be happy having you around here

24:09.382 --> 24:12.052
and I'd rather not see you
cripple yourself.

24:12.970 --> 24:16.056
Wait. You just said something nice to him.

24:16.139 --> 24:18.808
And yesterday you said "good job."

24:20.102 --> 24:21.144
Are you dying?

24:21.228 --> 24:22.562
[chuckles]

24:24.147 --> 24:25.148
One more thing.

24:26.149 --> 24:27.150
Here.

24:32.614 --> 24:33.615
Where'd you get this?

24:34.824 --> 24:36.201
Sold my championship ring.

24:36.284 --> 24:38.411
Figure all the money you gave me
over the years,

24:38.495 --> 24:39.621
it's the least I could do.

24:42.749 --> 24:43.750
No, thanks.

24:45.877 --> 24:48.546
Uh, Dad, we could use that money.

24:48.630 --> 24:50.173
Yeah, I want you to have it.

24:50.257 --> 24:52.634
Do I look like some kind of charity case?

24:52.717 --> 24:54.427
Oh, come on.
I'm just trying to help.

24:54.511 --> 24:57.555
We've got a country full of
people with their hand out.

24:59.057 --> 25:02.727
All I want is what I earn.
All anybody is gonna do for me is dig...

25:02.810 --> 25:06.439
[all] ...a six-foot hole in the ground
and drop me in it.

25:06.523 --> 25:10.027
Well, it ain't gonna be here
'cause you're about to lose this place.

25:10.110 --> 25:11.986
This place isn't yours to save.

25:12.070 --> 25:16.658
[stutters] Just swallow your pride
and take the damn money!

25:16.741 --> 25:18.410
Not gonna happen.

25:18.493 --> 25:21.996
God, you are such a stubborn
old son of a bitch!

25:23.790 --> 25:27.710
Listen, son...
I'm not too old to kick your ass.

25:30.505 --> 25:32.090
It's like my birthday all over again.

25:34.842 --> 25:36.386
You don't wanna start this with me, Dad.

25:36.469 --> 25:38.721
I didn't start this. You did.

25:38.805 --> 25:40.265
- Don't touch me.
- All right, relax, guys.

25:40.348 --> 25:42.184
No. I started this?
I started this?

25:42.267 --> 25:44.394
You drove me out of here!

25:44.477 --> 25:46.104
And then you drove Mom out of here!

25:46.188 --> 25:48.856
Hell, I left the gate open, even the cows
tried to get away from you!

25:48.940 --> 25:50.858
You're standing awful tall
for a man who came

25:50.942 --> 25:52.735
- crawling back on his hands and knees!
- Hey. Hey!

25:52.819 --> 25:53.861
- You...
- Hey!

25:53.945 --> 25:55.613
[both shout] What?

25:57.157 --> 25:58.158
It's rainin'.

26:07.250 --> 26:09.336
Screw you, Al Gore!

26:14.591 --> 26:16.259
[thunder cracking]

26:38.072 --> 26:39.741
Couldn't have just told Dad
you wanted to stay?

26:40.658 --> 26:41.659
What are you talking about?

26:41.743 --> 26:43.453
I know you made that team.

26:43.536 --> 26:44.579
Uh, no I didn't.

26:44.662 --> 26:47.249
When you got cut
from that team in Alaska...

26:47.332 --> 26:48.708
you punched out the mascot.

26:48.791 --> 26:50.752
Well, that mouthy penguin
had it coming.

26:52.044 --> 26:54.214
He kept telling the coach
I was drunk at practice.

26:54.297 --> 26:55.340
Were you?

26:55.423 --> 26:59.677
That's not the point.
The mascot's job is to support the team.

26:59.761 --> 27:02.639
[chuckles] You have the worst temper.

27:02.722 --> 27:04.391
If you didn't just make that team,

27:04.474 --> 27:06.351
there is no way you'd be
this calm right now.

27:08.186 --> 27:09.479
All right, don't tell Dad.

27:09.562 --> 27:12.399
If it doesn't make you look like an ass,
it's none of his business.

27:12.482 --> 27:13.816
[chuckles]

27:20.240 --> 27:22.033
Isn't this fantastic?

27:24.035 --> 27:25.870
Well, it's a start.

27:25.953 --> 27:28.039
Everything's getting a drink...

27:29.040 --> 27:30.333
including me.

27:32.419 --> 27:34.712
You know,
if someone took a picture of us...

27:34.796 --> 27:37.424
they'd never know
how fucked up we really were.

27:37.507 --> 27:38.800
[all chuckle]

27:38.883 --> 27:40.260
Well, to the Bennetts.

27:40.343 --> 27:41.636
The Bennetts.

27:44.181 --> 27:45.682
You know, I just wanna point out...

27:45.765 --> 27:48.935
that the rain did not arrive until I did.

27:49.018 --> 27:52.772
So... so, maybe I'm the good luck charm
this family needs.

27:52.855 --> 27:54.899
- [lightning crackling]
- [chuckles]

27:56.776 --> 27:58.486
Hell. The barn's on fire.

28:10.873 --> 28:12.917
