04:42.749 --> 04:45.819
Thanks.
You must really work out.

04:46.953 --> 04:48.455
Not that much.

04:48.555 --> 04:51.191
I could make an exception to
my no-men's-clothing rule,

04:51.324 --> 04:54.060
and design a perfect T-shirt
to show off those arms.

04:54.194 --> 04:56.363
Thanks.

04:56.496 --> 04:59.866
Johnny will see you
in his office after E's set.

05:00.000 --> 05:01.501
Right.

05:11.378 --> 05:13.613
Stunning as always, eh, hen?

05:13.747 --> 05:17.317
OK, it's a new theme -
Arabian Nights.

05:17.450 --> 05:20.120
It's gonna be a smash.
Matt's drawings are brilliant.

05:20.287 --> 05:22.222
Here is me as The Sheikh.

05:22.355 --> 05:24.858
Och, not this towel-head thing
again.

05:25.892 --> 05:29.729
Stick to the Spanish theme.
The punters love it.

05:29.863 --> 05:32.632
Let's leave the Arabs
out of it, eh?

05:32.766 --> 05:34.267
Och, come on, now, hen.

05:34.401 --> 05:37.504
Have we not got a winner here
with the Spanish thing?

05:37.637 --> 05:40.774
Yeah, but it's not really me,
Johnny.

05:40.907 --> 05:44.077
Dinnae mess with it

05:44.177 --> 05:45.745
Now...

05:45.845 --> 05:48.949
..was there anything
you wanted to tell me,

05:49.049 --> 05:52.285
anything you think
ah should know?

05:52.419 --> 05:54.354
You mean, the gig at Ice?

05:55.388 --> 05:58.391
Well, aren't we
the popular one, then?

05:58.525 --> 06:01.228
I suppose it's too much to ask
for a wee bit of loyalty.

06:01.361 --> 06:04.331
Oh, come on!
Don't be like that, Johnny.

06:04.464 --> 06:06.299
You know you'll always be
number one.

06:06.433 --> 06:09.569
Aye, I know I will. And
that is why I took the liberty

06:09.669 --> 06:12.272
of telling those lads at Ice
that you were nae available.

06:12.372 --> 06:14.774
- You can't do that!
- Who took a risk

06:14.874 --> 06:17.777
on a wee, Leb naebody
from the Gong,

06:17.877 --> 06:23.550
turned her into the top DJ?

06:25.852 --> 06:30.757
Now, I'm thinking, we need
a coffee and a catch-up...

06:32.392 --> 06:35.762
..just you and me,
like old times.

06:35.895 --> 06:37.998
- Sure, but I don't...
- And in future,

06:38.131 --> 06:39.666
you ask your Uncle Johnny

06:39.766 --> 06:42.302
before you go taking gigs
from other people.

06:42.435 --> 06:44.104
Is that too much to ask?

06:44.204 --> 06:45.705
Of course not, Johnny.

06:45.839 --> 06:47.574
Now you give your Uncle Johnny
a kiss,

10:45.211 --> 10:46.679
Alright, let's see.

10:48.081 --> 10:51.117
Hello there, John boy.

10:51.251 --> 10:52.685
Someone once said

10:52.886 --> 10:58.825
I'm like an Irish version
of Robert Pattinson.

11:01.094 --> 11:03.463
Liar, liar, pants on fire.

11:10.570 --> 11:12.805

before we meet?

11:22.949 --> 11:24.717
- Elmira?
- Mrs Malouf.

11:24.851 --> 11:27.554
It's me, Matt. Matthew.

11:27.720 --> 11:29.088
Elmira?

11:29.222 --> 11:31.424
No, she's in the shower.

Manners!

Manners, manners!

11:39.132 --> 11:41.267
Babe, who was that?

11:41.401 --> 11:43.603
- Your mother.
- What does she want?

11:43.736 --> 11:45.972
What does she want
every Saturday when she calls?

11:46.105 --> 11:47.607
That I don't exist.

11:49.509 --> 11:51.945
You back on the chat room
again?

11:53.446 --> 11:54.914
No!

11:56.082 --> 11:58.184
How else
am I supposed to find a man?

11:58.318 --> 12:01.588
Not by pretending you have
amazing abs, that's for sure.

12:01.754 --> 12:04.223
Outrageous!
Speaking of outrageous,

12:04.324 --> 12:06.092
what are we going to do
about Johnny?

12:06.225 --> 12:08.628
Look, I know he gets
a little bit over the top.

12:08.761 --> 12:11.798
Over the top?
Psychopathic, more like.

12:13.600 --> 12:16.936
We have to leave, E.
Ice really want us.

12:17.036 --> 12:20.206
They'll let us do Arabian
Nights. Whatever we want.

12:20.340 --> 12:22.675

threatened to firebomb them

- if we play there.
- Fuck, E!

12:25.912 --> 12:27.914

12:29.215 --> 12:31.184
Stop. Make it bigger.

12:33.086 --> 12:34.821
Who's that blonde tart?

12:34.988 --> 12:37.190
It's the barmaid from Ice.

12:37.323 --> 12:40.193
Ice♪Those fucking towelheads.

12:42.295 --> 12:44.330

12:44.464 --> 12:46.132
It is too.

12:46.232 --> 12:48.234
Boss,
you can't think E's involved?

12:48.368 --> 12:50.970
There's no way
she'd do that to me.

12:57.844 --> 13:00.713
Oh. Looks like
Johnny's ears are burning.

13:00.813 --> 13:04.083
Jesus, E!
It's my fecking birthday.

13:04.217 --> 13:06.219
D'you think we can just last
one day without

13:06.319 --> 13:08.655
talking to that psycho
scrooge uncle of yours?

13:08.821 --> 13:11.858
OK, I'm all yours. It's off.

13:11.991 --> 13:13.893
Let's go. I need a coffee.

13:16.129 --> 13:18.164
Come on, come on.

13:18.264 --> 13:21.367
Come on, come on, come on.

13:21.501 --> 13:23.603
Hey, this is E.
You know what...

13:30.610 --> 13:33.312
In your pigsty, please.

13:34.614 --> 13:36.783
Not mine.

Well, it's not mine.

Well, it's not mine.

13:40.520 --> 13:42.355
Well, it's not mine!

13:50.229 --> 13:53.466
We are so in the money!

13:53.599 --> 13:55.601
Where did it come from?

13:55.735 --> 13:57.870
Who cares?

13:57.970 --> 13:59.505
Well, how much is here?

13:59.639 --> 14:01.641
Listen, E,
what happened last night?

14:01.774 --> 14:03.276
Nothing.

14:03.409 --> 14:05.445
Jaki and I were wasted,
so we caught a taxi.

14:05.578 --> 14:07.513
Which taxi?
We have to give it back.

14:07.647 --> 14:08.715
Are you crazy?

14:08.848 --> 14:10.783
- I'm calling the police.
- No you're not.

14:10.883 --> 14:12.785
Give it! Matt!

14:17.223 --> 14:18.725
Who is it?

14:18.858 --> 14:23.229
We're collecting for
the Give a Girl a Go appeal.

14:25.398 --> 14:27.100
Kylie and Tanya.

14:27.233 --> 14:31.971
We're collecting for
the Give a Girl a Go appeal.

14:32.105 --> 14:33.940
Ah, here you go, girls.

14:34.040 --> 14:36.309
- Love your work.
- Thank you.

14:37.610 --> 14:39.612
Tightarse.

14:39.712 --> 14:42.582
Here! You girls are
doing a great job.

14:44.650 --> 14:48.321
Think! In a bag like this,
this much cash.

14:48.454 --> 14:51.390
Do you think that a) the taxi
driver who gave you a lift

14:51.491 --> 14:53.159
is just some eccentric
millionaire

14:53.292 --> 14:54.827
who's driving his taxi
for kicks?

14:54.961 --> 14:56.496
No. I didn't think so either.

14:56.629 --> 14:57.764
Or what do you think,

14:57.864 --> 15:00.133
is it actually b) some
son-of-a-gun drug dealer

15:00.266 --> 15:02.502
who's a little too smashed
on his own merchandise

15:02.635 --> 15:05.037
to realise he's mislaid
a small matter of, what,

15:05.171 --> 15:06.706
say, half a million
in used 50s?

15:06.839 --> 15:08.808
So why don't we keep it?

15:09.842 --> 15:12.812
No! Because that taxi driver
is probably

15:12.912 --> 15:15.381
navigating under water
as we speak,

15:15.515 --> 15:17.617
and I tell you, I cannot swim!

15:18.751 --> 15:20.253
Calm the fuck down.

15:20.419 --> 15:22.822
No-one knows that
we have this.

15:25.291 --> 15:28.294
They find the taxi driver,
they find us.

15:28.427 --> 15:31.197
I want it out of the house
now. Bad karma!

15:31.330 --> 15:34.000
Come on, Matt. You want
to leave Johnny, right?

15:44.911 --> 15:46.946
Oh, my God!

15:47.079 --> 15:48.581
Of course!

15:57.056 --> 15:58.724
Fuck.

16:19.979 --> 16:23.015
He didn't leave anything!

16:23.149 --> 16:24.784
You've got the wrong man!

16:24.917 --> 16:26.619
I didn't find anything!

16:29.555 --> 16:31.224
No, wait, no!

16:32.425 --> 16:33.926
Boss?

16:44.370 --> 16:47.240
Why do you have to bullshit
everyone?

16:47.340 --> 16:49.642
- I didn't.
- Oh, for sure.

16:49.775 --> 16:52.478
The flowers were for me!

16:52.612 --> 16:55.448
Yoo-hoo! Mr and Mrs Toreador.

16:55.548 --> 16:57.316

Hi, Mitze, Kitty.

16:59.185 --> 17:00.486

17:00.620 --> 17:03.222
You can always tell a man
by what he rides.

17:03.389 --> 17:05.925
Hey, arse fuckers!
Old, fucking fags!

17:06.058 --> 17:08.694
- What the fuck is that?
- Waste of a good Holden.

17:08.794 --> 17:10.630
Piss off and leave us alone.

17:10.762 --> 17:13.465
Suck my dick,
ya fuckin' dyke.

17:13.598 --> 17:16.636
- My pleasure, darling...
- Wa-hey!

17:16.769 --> 17:19.805
..if I could find
the tiny thing, I so would.

17:19.939 --> 17:21.773
What did he say to me?

17:28.481 --> 17:30.249
Psycho bitch! Fuck off!

17:32.418 --> 17:34.720
You OK, girls?

17:34.887 --> 17:37.723
Aren't you
a little Ninja Turtle?

17:37.823 --> 17:40.159
Just young boys, letting off
a bit of steam, darl.

17:40.293 --> 17:42.662
I'm sure I fucked
one of those boys last month.

17:42.795 --> 17:46.499
I need a drink. Come on.
Bye, Matt.

17:46.632 --> 17:48.134
Bye, E.

17:54.307 --> 17:55.975
Fuck! Oh, my God.

18:05.885 --> 18:07.386
What the fuck?

18:07.520 --> 18:09.822
Do you know
how much these cost now?

18:09.989 --> 18:12.024
Oh, he must have every model!

18:14.026 --> 18:15.594
Come on!

18:15.695 --> 18:18.464
- You didn't lock the door.
- Me♪You were last to leave.

18:25.204 --> 18:27.740
Shit! Shit.

18:27.873 --> 18:30.242
You said nobody knew.
We have to go to the police.

18:30.376 --> 18:33.245
Stop screaming.
I'm trying to think.

18:33.379 --> 18:35.948
I'm sure that car
is following us.

18:37.249 --> 18:38.718
Ohh.

18:38.818 --> 18:40.920
A mother and two kids♪Yeah.

18:41.053 --> 18:42.455
We just need to find someone

18:42.488 --> 18:44.123
who'll put us up
for a couple of days

18:44.290 --> 18:46.125
while we work out what to do,
OK?

18:47.460 --> 18:50.329
What about Leonora,
my old landlady?

18:50.463 --> 18:52.999
We are not
that desperate.

18:53.165 --> 18:54.600
Oh!

18:56.202 --> 18:57.870
Who is this girl?

18:58.004 --> 19:01.741
She was a beachside romance.
She really loves me.

19:10.983 --> 19:13.119
Well! That went well.

19:24.096 --> 19:25.798
Mum!

19:27.633 --> 19:29.301
Dad!

19:29.435 --> 19:31.971
She said
she was a bit confused.

19:32.104 --> 19:33.606
Not anymore.

19:36.409 --> 19:38.344
Hey, Lou.

19:40.012 --> 19:42.548
It's been over a year.

19:42.681 --> 19:45.518
Wait - I've got your money.

19:45.651 --> 19:47.987
- 700.

19:48.120 --> 19:49.889
Plus 100 to say thanks.

19:50.956 --> 19:54.427
Took you long enough. What
happened, you rob a bank?

19:59.098 --> 20:02.168
Look, the thing is, Lou,
we need a place to stay,

20:02.268 --> 20:03.803
just for a few days.

20:03.936 --> 20:07.206
- I don't think that's a g...
- Habibti.

20:07.339 --> 20:10.009
You know I wouldn't ask
unless it was urgent.

20:12.778 --> 20:16.649
Nah, nah. My mum was right
about you. You're trouble, E.

20:18.584 --> 20:21.754
If we're finished with those
people you've dumped, ignored

20:21.921 --> 20:25.391
or fought with, we might have
no other alternative.

20:25.491 --> 20:27.593
You said she was
a total fruit loop.

20:27.726 --> 20:30.129
Well, that doesn't mean
she can't be trusted.

20:31.630 --> 20:33.966
I had a feeling
you'd be coming.

20:34.100 --> 20:35.634
Many happy returns.

20:38.204 --> 20:39.672
Don't ask.

20:40.706 --> 20:43.676
Leonora. Leonora Laventallini.

20:43.809 --> 20:45.077
E. Just E.

20:45.211 --> 20:48.247
Well, that's short
and to the point. Come in.

20:49.381 --> 20:53.119
This is you,
the Page of Cups -

20:53.252 --> 20:56.722
beautiful, artistic,
emotional...

20:57.790 --> 20:59.291
..deep.

21:00.326 --> 21:02.828
But reversed,
this is the immature card.

21:02.962 --> 21:04.864
I could have told you that.

21:07.633 --> 21:09.802
More Swords behind you.

21:12.571 --> 21:14.540
Great loss or heartbreak.

21:15.674 --> 21:17.877
- Her younger brother.
- Matt, don't.

21:18.010 --> 21:21.180
Michael. He was only 17.
Killed - drunk driver.

21:21.280 --> 21:23.315
- Terrible!
- Matt, shut up!

21:23.449 --> 21:25.551
This doesn't feel like a man.

21:27.253 --> 21:28.954
- This feels like a woman.
- OK.

21:29.121 --> 21:31.357
We don't have time
for this psychic babble.

21:31.490 --> 21:32.992
E! How can you be so rude?

21:33.125 --> 21:34.527
Can we borrow your car?

21:42.501 --> 21:45.671
Shite, shite!
What are we going to do, E?

21:45.771 --> 21:48.240
Why don't we ask Johnny?
He knows all the heavies.

21:48.374 --> 21:50.376
Stop running to feckin Johnny
all the time.

21:50.543 --> 21:52.611
I'm just saying
he'd know what to do.

21:52.745 --> 21:55.314
What a grand idea... Let's go
live with Uncle Johnny.

21:55.347 --> 21:57.449
You got any better ideas?

21:59.852 --> 22:02.121
What about Bali,
or Shanghai?

22:03.689 --> 22:06.025
My one and only chance
to travel first-class...

22:06.158 --> 22:07.393
How was I supposed to know

22:07.526 --> 22:09.028
you need ID
for domestic travel?

22:09.161 --> 22:11.397
You went to college!
I rely on you.

22:11.564 --> 22:14.266
Well, you shouldn't!
I dropped out.

22:16.802 --> 22:18.938
Hey, this is E.

22:21.507 --> 22:24.343
- Elmira?
- Hi, Mumma. It's me.

22:24.476 --> 22:27.179
Matt and I were thinking
of visiting you and Dad.

22:27.313 --> 22:29.281
We... we could come now,
really.

22:51.604 --> 22:53.973
Clarinet Concerto
in A Minor

23:20.933 --> 23:22.434
Penny for them?

23:25.704 --> 23:27.406
It'll cost you.

23:27.539 --> 23:29.675
Oh, really♪How much?

23:32.077 --> 23:34.480
You can't afford it.

23:34.580 --> 23:37.082
Says who, Princess?

23:37.216 --> 23:38.917
- Princess?!
- Yeah!

23:39.051 --> 23:41.687
- Says me, Skippy!
- We'll see about that!

23:41.787 --> 23:43.289
Move in with me.

23:44.590 --> 23:46.091
What?

23:48.093 --> 23:49.595
Move in with me.

23:50.629 --> 23:52.398
Really?

23:52.498 --> 23:54.033
Really.

23:59.505 --> 24:01.040
OK.

24:05.177 --> 24:08.280
Jaysus! Can we not
play something else?

24:08.414 --> 24:11.784
Your man Kenny G sounds like
he's being strangled.

24:11.917 --> 24:14.887
Ow! What was that for?

24:14.987 --> 24:18.324
Kenny G plays the sax,
not the clarinet.

24:18.490 --> 24:20.893
Sax, clarinet -

26:33.625 --> 26:35.694
..and I'm here again.

26:54.847 --> 26:56.482
- Shit!
- Ignore it.

26:58.083 --> 26:59.585
I can't.

26:59.718 --> 27:01.720
- OK, OK. I'll answer it.
- No!

27:01.820 --> 27:04.256
- No!
- Hello?

27:04.389 --> 27:07.693
- Elmira?
- Hello, Mrs Malouf.

27:07.826 --> 27:09.628
- Elmira?
- No, this is Trish.

27:09.728 --> 27:11.230
- Hello, Mumma.
- Who?

27:11.363 --> 27:13.232
- No, it's me.
- You still in bed?

27:13.365 --> 27:15.033
No, Mumma.
I've been up for hours.

27:15.167 --> 27:17.169
Who answered your phone.
You have visitor?

27:17.269 --> 27:20.172
No, that's Trish.
You know, my flatmate.

27:20.272 --> 27:23.041
I have some
very important news.

27:23.141 --> 27:24.243
Your cousin Darina,

27:24.376 --> 27:26.712
she christen the baby Michael
on the 30th.

27:26.812 --> 27:29.248
I didn't think
she talked to you.

27:29.348 --> 27:33.352
This time we invited. We come
to Sydney for three days.

27:33.485 --> 27:36.522
The church, a big party
afterwards - everybody coming.

27:36.655 --> 27:39.024
The 30th for three days.

27:39.191 --> 27:40.692
Who you talking to?

27:40.826 --> 27:45.864
You no want us to come?
I'm not staying with Darina.

27:45.964 --> 27:49.201
No, Mumma,
of course you can stay.

27:49.301 --> 27:52.938
Trish will be away that
weekend, won't you, Trish?

28:00.746 --> 28:03.782
Mumma, I'm going to have
to call you back.

28:07.452 --> 28:09.187
- Hey.
- Don't.

28:11.423 --> 28:12.925
What could I do?

28:14.459 --> 28:16.128
I don't know.

28:16.261 --> 28:17.763
You could say no.

28:19.064 --> 28:21.266
You could say,
'Let me just ask Trish.

28:21.400 --> 28:23.468
She really hates it
when I take all of her stuff

28:23.602 --> 28:25.404
out of our room
and puts it in the lounge

28:25.504 --> 28:27.005
like she's the bloody lodger.

28:27.139 --> 28:29.675
- It's not like that.
- You could even say,

28:29.808 --> 28:33.845
'My beautiful lover and I have
our anniversary that weekend,

28:33.979 --> 28:36.081
and it's really important.'

28:39.551 --> 28:41.053
I'm really sorry.

28:42.254 --> 28:44.690
You know how crazy
she makes me.

28:44.823 --> 28:47.626
Yeah, I do,
but I thought just this once

28:47.759 --> 28:49.895
you could think of me, of us.

28:49.995 --> 28:53.198
- I do!
- So tell them.

28:55.534 --> 28:57.669
You're ashamed, aren't you?

29:04.076 --> 29:05.544
You're a coward, E.

29:06.578 --> 29:08.513
You're a fucking coward.

29:17.956 --> 29:19.758
Is my tattoo covered?

29:19.858 --> 29:21.960
Uh-huh.

29:22.094 --> 29:24.029
Do I look straight?

29:27.299 --> 29:28.800
Now?

29:31.703 --> 29:33.205
Now?

29:36.575 --> 29:38.076
Now?

29:39.277 --> 29:42.414
Alright, wifey,
let's go face the music.

29:52.524 --> 29:56.461
You never come to see us.
You ring us three hours ago.

29:56.561 --> 29:59.364
Where you been♪Your father
and I been worried sick.

29:59.498 --> 30:02.100
Mumma, relax. We're here now.

30:02.234 --> 30:03.935
Mrs Malouf...

30:04.069 --> 30:07.372
The food is almost ruined.
Come, we eat now.

30:07.472 --> 30:10.575
Red hair!
How can you do this to us?

30:14.279 --> 30:16.748
Habibti, we miss you.

30:17.783 --> 30:19.284
Me too, Dad.

30:19.418 --> 30:21.019
You, you come with me.

30:25.857 --> 30:27.426
Mr Malouf.

30:27.559 --> 30:29.428
Joseph.

30:29.561 --> 30:32.364
Sorry - Joseph.

30:32.497 --> 30:34.533
How's it going,
mate?

30:34.633 --> 30:37.269
Good, thanks.

30:37.402 --> 30:41.573
You come, no warning.
We have no food in the house.

30:43.675 --> 30:46.478
Why we have to have
this emergency meeting,

30:46.611 --> 30:48.680
like you have
emergency wedding, huh?

30:48.780 --> 30:51.049
I still can't believe you
thought I was pregnant.

30:51.183 --> 30:53.852
Don't eat! Cut some onion.
We need more onion.

30:55.987 --> 30:57.489
Oh, that's...

31:01.359 --> 31:03.295
- I... I take this.
- Oh no!

31:03.428 --> 31:06.131
No, it's alright.

31:06.264 --> 31:07.766
Sit, sit.

31:14.139 --> 31:17.309
Why you marry this fat man
with red hair?

31:17.442 --> 31:21.847
Mum! He's not fat,
and he's not deaf.

31:21.947 --> 31:25.183
And why you wear your hair
like this?

31:25.317 --> 31:27.052
And why you choose him

31:27.185 --> 31:29.721
when you could have that boy,
Khabbaz?

31:29.855 --> 31:31.389
'Cause he's a pig,
that's why.

31:31.556 --> 31:33.558
Cut the bread,
we need more bread.

31:35.761 --> 31:37.963
What about your music?

31:38.130 --> 31:40.265
You fail your exam.
Everybody know.

31:40.365 --> 31:42.167
They say,
'Why she leave university?'

31:42.300 --> 31:44.503
Your brother never do this
to us!

31:44.636 --> 31:47.272
Yeah. He just stole cars
and didn't finish high school

31:47.372 --> 31:48.874
but he's still Saint Michael.

31:48.974 --> 31:52.410
You shame us.

31:52.544 --> 31:54.746
We already live with
so much shame.

32:01.419 --> 32:04.089
Elmira.

32:04.222 --> 32:08.827
You proper musician.
You can work in the orchestra,

32:08.994 --> 32:13.732
teach music, get proper job.
Your teacher say so.

32:13.865 --> 32:16.234
I tried, and it's not me,
Mumma.

32:17.636 --> 32:19.805
No?

32:19.905 --> 32:22.007
Who you, Elmira?

32:22.174 --> 32:23.909
Who you are?

32:26.678 --> 32:30.415
All my life I work hard
for you to go to university,

32:30.549 --> 32:33.318
but you! It gets too hard,
you just throw it all away.

32:33.451 --> 32:36.721
Poof! Like that! Like it's
nothing, like we nothing.

32:36.822 --> 32:38.490
How can you say that?

32:38.657 --> 32:41.493
Ever since you a little girl,
you like this, stubborn!

32:41.626 --> 32:44.229
No respect.

32:44.362 --> 32:46.998
Your father and I,
we give you everything.

32:47.098 --> 32:50.168
We have you, we get married.
I don't sing anymore.

32:50.268 --> 32:53.171
I never asked you to have me.

33:15.527 --> 33:17.028
Umi...

33:20.632 --> 33:24.302
You and me, we're not
too different, you know.

33:24.436 --> 33:26.705
You reckon?

33:26.805 --> 33:30.742
You make my stomach very bad
from what you do to us.

33:30.842 --> 33:33.278
- Dr Nassar...
- What does he say?

33:33.411 --> 33:37.215
He say my ulcer is back.
Is very bad.

33:37.349 --> 33:40.151
I go back to hospital
if I not careful,

33:40.285 --> 33:41.786
if I get upset.

33:45.223 --> 33:47.225
Alright Umi.

33:47.359 --> 33:49.694
You can have a huge party
for us.

33:49.794 --> 33:52.397
Invite every single cousin
we have.

33:52.530 --> 33:53.999
You play clarinet for us?

33:54.099 --> 33:56.568
I haven't played
in over a year.

34:01.273 --> 34:03.208
OK.

34:03.341 --> 34:06.444
Just tonight,
give Matt a chance.

34:09.447 --> 34:12.583
A fat chance, huh♪

34:19.123 --> 34:20.725
Whew!

34:20.824 --> 34:22.560
What's this called again?

34:22.661 --> 34:25.730
- Arak.
- Ah, is the milk of the lion.

34:25.830 --> 34:28.934
It's very special. It's from
my brother in Lebanon.

34:29.034 --> 34:32.536
- It's lethal.
- It suits this kitty cat.

34:32.670 --> 34:35.139
I'm just saying, what we do
in Ireland in the country

34:35.239 --> 34:36.741
is sing and dance.

34:36.875 --> 34:38.710
Lord of the Riverdance,
that's me.

34:38.842 --> 34:40.344
I love to dance.

34:40.478 --> 34:44.014
I used to dance all the time
in the club in Beirut.

34:44.114 --> 34:46.952
I bet you cut a fine figure on
the dance floor, Mrs Malouf.

34:47.085 --> 34:50.989
I better singer,
ah, a long time ago.

34:51.121 --> 34:53.123
You show us this dancing.

34:53.324 --> 34:56.962
Er... I don't think
that's such a great idea.

34:57.094 --> 34:59.264
How about a song for us,
Mrs Malouf?

34:59.364 --> 35:02.467
Please,
you leave this man alone.

35:02.567 --> 35:06.371
Your father, he doesn't like
singing or dancing.

35:06.504 --> 35:09.107
But you listen to me -
he used to like it

35:09.240 --> 35:10.742
before everything change.

35:10.875 --> 35:12.711
Nadine!

35:12.844 --> 35:16.514
No, you cooked.
Let me clean up.

35:16.614 --> 35:18.483
No, I do. You guest.

35:18.616 --> 35:20.118
No, I insist.

35:20.251 --> 35:22.253

35:29.127 --> 35:32.364

35:32.497 --> 35:35.200
You upset her.

35:35.367 --> 35:37.168

35:43.742 --> 35:45.276

your mother gave you those.

Fabulous.

36:00.358 --> 36:03.061

36:03.194 --> 36:05.163
They don't like you that much.

36:22.080 --> 36:24.182
Do you not miss it?

36:24.215 --> 36:27.152
Nah. Being a DJ's much cooler.

38:04.415 --> 38:06.317
OK.

fairly soon now,

39:04.742 --> 39:07.312

He is a bad man.

39:07.445 --> 39:10.848
He's got bad friends,
he smoke bad cigarettes.

39:10.982 --> 39:12.984
- Exactly.
- He can't cook!

39:13.117 --> 39:16.054
- We stay here.
- Mumma, you can't stay here.

39:16.187 --> 39:18.856

You have to go to Ali.

39:18.990 --> 39:20.892
- Tell him there's trouble.
- Enough!

39:22.427 --> 39:23.695
We will go.

39:23.795 --> 39:25.763
Dad, I'm so sorry.

39:25.897 --> 39:29.334
Is for you, for later.

39:29.467 --> 39:30.969
Let's go.

39:41.980 --> 39:44.549
I knew this was too good
to be true.

39:44.682 --> 39:46.351
We have to give it back, E.

39:46.484 --> 39:49.587
- No, we don't.
- What?

39:49.721 --> 39:52.257
He thinks he's in charge
of everything,

39:52.390 --> 39:54.125
can control everyone.

39:54.292 --> 39:56.394
Well, he's about to find out
he's wrong.

39:56.494 --> 39:57.996
Are you crazy?

39:58.129 --> 40:00.632
He had no right to cancel Ice.

40:00.765 --> 40:02.267
Let him stew.

40:02.367 --> 40:05.270
It's not like he can go to the
police and report it missing.

40:05.370 --> 40:07.705
No, but he can kill us.

40:07.839 --> 40:09.974
Not if he can't find us.

40:51.049 --> 40:53.751
Do you think your parents
will be OK?

40:53.885 --> 40:55.386
Yeah. Ali's a thug.

40:55.486 --> 40:58.589
If anyone can handle Johnny,
he can.

40:58.723 --> 41:01.326
I wish we'd given it
to the police.

41:01.492 --> 41:03.361
Then Johnny really would
kill us.

41:03.494 --> 41:05.963
I still don't get you and him.

41:06.064 --> 41:08.199
OK, so you don't get it.

41:08.333 --> 41:09.834
Nobody does.

41:29.253 --> 41:30.755
Hey.

41:30.855 --> 41:35.026
You know, I still don't know
why all of Row 4 have died.

41:35.193 --> 41:36.894
It should be a good mix.

41:38.563 --> 41:41.532
- I got it, Trish.
- Got what?

41:41.632 --> 41:44.102
Johnny's given me top billing.

41:44.235 --> 41:46.037
You're looking at
the new resident DJ

41:46.137 --> 41:47.638

41:47.772 --> 41:50.274
Don't you have clarinet
quartet on Saturday nights?

41:50.408 --> 41:52.443
No biggie.
They can find someone else.

41:52.577 --> 41:54.178
I thought you said
they'd fail you

41:54.312 --> 41:56.781
if you didn't play
in the quartet?

41:56.914 --> 42:00.184
Maybe I don't want
to play the clarinet anymore.

42:00.318 --> 42:02.553
You're joking?

42:02.687 --> 42:04.222
This is my chance.

42:04.355 --> 42:06.991
Johnny says that I'm the best
DJ he's seen in years.

42:07.091 --> 42:09.193
I could be really big.

42:09.360 --> 42:11.462
Why can't you be happy for me?

42:11.596 --> 42:15.099
I can,
if it's what you really want.

42:15.233 --> 42:17.902
- It is.
- I don't believe you.

42:18.002 --> 42:19.771

01:00:38.602 --> 01:00:40.103
You?

01:00:50.614 --> 01:00:52.115
What am I doing?

01:00:55.151 --> 01:00:57.487
You really hurt me, E,

01:00:57.621 --> 01:01:00.457
and I promised myself I would
never let you do that again.

01:01:00.590 --> 01:01:02.626
- Me too.
- Yet here you are,

01:01:02.726 --> 01:01:04.995
back in my life,
causing trouble, as always.

01:01:05.128 --> 01:01:07.497
- Please, Trish.
- Just don't.

01:01:17.774 --> 01:01:19.276
I can't.

01:05:24.120 --> 01:05:26.222
Hello, you.

01:05:26.356 --> 01:05:27.857
Hello, you.

01:05:54.651 --> 01:05:57.720
You know, I did try, Trish.
I really did...

01:06:05.161 --> 01:06:07.030
Try?

01:06:07.197 --> 01:06:09.332
You don't know the meaning
of the word.

01:06:09.465 --> 01:06:13.102
Try running a property
after ten years of drought.

01:06:13.236 --> 01:06:15.405
Try beating cancer.

01:06:15.538 --> 01:06:17.040
That's not fair.

01:06:17.173 --> 01:06:18.641
Are you serious?

01:06:27.984 --> 01:06:29.152
Oh, right on cue.

01:06:29.285 --> 01:06:31.020
I was wondering
where you girls were.

01:06:31.154 --> 01:06:33.456
- I have made...
- I won't be having breakfast.

01:06:33.590 --> 01:06:36.159
Be out all day.
Come on, Tiny.

01:08:07.550 --> 01:08:10.386
Be careful - you'll flood it.

01:08:11.688 --> 01:08:13.122
Be my guest.

01:08:15.992 --> 01:08:18.962
After all I've done
for that wee bitch.

01:08:24.567 --> 01:08:26.803
What am ah to do, eh, hen?

01:08:28.237 --> 01:08:29.738
What?

01:08:29.872 --> 01:08:32.675
Why's she done this to me, eh?

01:08:48.124 --> 01:08:49.625
Got ya.

01:08:49.759 --> 01:08:51.627
Fuckin' gotcha!

01:09:41.144 --> 01:09:45.180
I don't know how I'm going to
live without that sound.

01:10:01.097 --> 01:10:03.232
E was right, you are an angel.

01:10:05.401 --> 01:10:09.272
And yet, despite my best
efforts, here I am, single.

01:10:09.439 --> 01:10:13.543
Their loss. E's really
lucky to have you as a friend.

01:10:15.278 --> 01:10:16.813
It's a Buffet.

01:10:23.352 --> 01:10:26.756
Something I meant to give you
a long time ago.

01:10:27.924 --> 01:10:29.759
I gotta go.

01:10:54.617 --> 01:10:56.385
Morning, Prue.

01:10:56.519 --> 01:10:58.454
I've just been
talking about you.

01:10:58.588 --> 01:11:02.291
- All good, I hope.
- Not really, but you'll live.

01:11:03.426 --> 01:11:05.495
Seriously - a couple of blokes
from Sydney

01:11:05.628 --> 01:11:07.296
been asking about you.

01:11:07.463 --> 01:11:10.666
That's me - Miss Popularity.
What did they want?

01:11:10.833 --> 01:11:14.403
How to get to your place. They
seemed very keen to see it.

01:11:14.537 --> 01:11:16.339
What were they like?

01:11:16.506 --> 01:11:20.443
One was Scottish, or Irish.
Bloody rude, if you ask me.

01:11:20.576 --> 01:11:22.445
- Yeah?
- I didn't like them.

01:11:22.578 --> 01:11:24.280
I sent them via Stony Gums.

01:11:24.413 --> 01:11:27.083
- That's for 4-wheel drives.
- Yeah, I know.

01:11:29.952 --> 01:11:31.487
Thanks, Prue.

01:11:39.662 --> 01:11:41.531
- Hey, that was quick!
- Where's E?

01:11:41.697 --> 01:11:43.966
She's still on the fence line.

01:11:46.202 --> 01:11:47.837
Hey, what's the hurry?

01:11:47.937 --> 01:11:50.540
You need to get up
to the Warrens' old property.

01:11:50.673 --> 01:11:52.375
No-one will find you up there.

01:11:52.475 --> 01:11:54.810
That food'll keep you
for a bit.

01:11:54.944 --> 01:11:57.280
As long as I don't
have to fire that thing.

01:11:57.380 --> 01:11:59.882
Hopefully,
it won't come to that.

01:11:59.982 --> 01:12:02.752
Now, clothes.

01:12:04.086 --> 01:12:07.123
You want me to walk
20 more kilometres?

01:12:07.256 --> 01:12:09.158
We're not going without you.

01:12:09.292 --> 01:12:11.060
- I have to talk to Bev first.
- Who's Bev?

01:12:11.194 --> 01:12:13.029
That's none of your business.

01:12:13.162 --> 01:12:16.032
Now get going,
and take Tiny with you.

01:12:17.600 --> 01:12:19.969
Come on, Tiny.

01:12:44.327 --> 01:12:45.828
Fucking push!

01:12:52.602 --> 01:12:54.136
You get this fucking car
going,

01:12:54.270 --> 01:12:57.139
and come and pick me up.
Understood?

01:13:21.364 --> 01:13:24.900
Oh, God. You've
slept with her, haven't you?

01:13:25.034 --> 01:13:26.669
What makes you say that?

01:13:26.802 --> 01:13:29.839
Trish, I haven't slept with
anyone in five years.

01:13:29.972 --> 01:13:32.575
It gives you a kind of
NASA like radar.

01:13:32.708 --> 01:13:36.545
I can literally smell
the pheromones coming off you.

01:13:36.679 --> 01:13:38.848
I hope you know
what you're doing, hon.

01:13:38.981 --> 01:13:41.250
That's just it - I don't.

01:13:41.384 --> 01:13:45.721
She comes here after all this
time, and I can't help it.

01:13:45.855 --> 01:13:49.325
It's like, I'm screaming,
'No, don't go near her,'

01:13:49.458 --> 01:13:51.460
but my body just
won't obey me.

01:13:51.594 --> 01:13:54.397
- Oh-oh. That sounds bad.
- It is.

01:13:54.497 --> 01:13:57.099
Like, Bad-Bad or Bad-Good?

01:14:01.837 --> 01:14:04.840
Look, I just need you
to help me get rid of her

01:14:04.974 --> 01:14:07.510
before
she gets herself killed.

01:14:07.610 --> 01:14:10.446
- Can you do that for me?
- Sure.

01:14:10.579 --> 01:14:12.715
You know I love an adventure.

01:14:19.121 --> 01:14:20.790
How many flies
did you eat, E?

01:14:23.426 --> 01:14:26.329
Tell you what -
that's why I'm fat,

01:14:26.462 --> 01:14:29.765
all these flies
you've got in this country.

01:14:32.535 --> 01:14:34.437
Feck! Flies!

01:14:34.570 --> 01:14:36.605
Don't worry,
I can handle Johnny.

01:14:36.739 --> 01:14:39.742
Johnny won't hurt us.
Johnny loves me!

01:14:39.875 --> 01:14:41.377
Come on, Matt.

01:14:41.477 --> 01:14:43.813
Always think you can get out
of things, don't you, E?

01:14:43.946 --> 01:14:45.815
- How was I to know?
- I dunno. Be radical.

01:14:45.948 --> 01:14:48.684
Try thinking of other people
instead of yourself, for once!

01:14:48.818 --> 01:14:52.688
Your woman Trish had the
right idea - keep well away.

01:14:53.756 --> 01:14:56.058
- Matt, I'm sorry.
- Not as sorry as I am.

01:14:56.192 --> 01:14:58.828
If we get out of this alive,
we're getting a divorce.

01:14:58.961 --> 01:15:01.864
I'm taking my share,
and I'm back to Ireland.

01:15:01.997 --> 01:15:04.166
You can keep your flies too.

01:17:17.066 --> 01:17:18.567
Come on, Tiny.

01:17:30.579 --> 01:17:33.282
Huh, The Hilton!

01:17:34.316 --> 01:17:37.419
- It's not bad.
- And I'm filthy!

01:17:37.520 --> 01:17:39.088
I'll get tea on.

01:17:39.188 --> 01:17:41.857
Baked beans, coming up,
no doubt.

01:17:41.991 --> 01:17:45.294
You're more than welcome
to cook yourself.

01:17:45.394 --> 01:17:47.863
No, look - sorry. Truce.

01:17:47.997 --> 01:17:50.833
I'm sorry about that stuff
I said before.

01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:53.202
I'm just... I'm tired
and I'm scared, and...

01:17:53.302 --> 01:17:54.803
Me too.

01:18:05.781 --> 01:18:07.483
What do you mean,
no way?

01:18:07.616 --> 01:18:10.019
Seems to me like
you're in with a chance,

01:18:10.152 --> 01:18:11.687
if you don't blow it.

01:18:14.823 --> 01:18:17.159
She should be here by now.

01:19:33.836 --> 01:19:36.405
And that is how
I met the parents.

01:19:36.538 --> 01:19:37.840
I can't believe you're still

01:19:38.007 --> 01:19:39.642
going through with
this charade.

01:19:39.742 --> 01:19:42.411
Well, you would too,
if you knew my parents.

01:19:42.544 --> 01:19:45.247
Well, I was never allowed to,
was I?

01:19:49.652 --> 01:19:51.286
We should all get
some rest.

01:19:51.420 --> 01:19:53.222
