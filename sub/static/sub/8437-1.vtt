03:38.100 --> 03:40.100
Aah!

03:56.700 --> 03:58.200
lt's love, isn't it?

03:58.300 --> 03:59.800
Sometimes you walk into a house

03:59.900 --> 04:02.800
and you take one look around ,
and you know.

04:02.900 --> 04:04.300
And you say, ''This is for me.''

04:04.400 --> 04:06.300
Oh , l think it's perfect.

04:06.400 --> 04:09.700
lt's just what
we've been looking for.

04:09.800 --> 04:11.400
There aren't enough plugs.

04:11.400 --> 04:12.800
Hey, wait, Mr. Coleman , now.

04:12.800 --> 04:14.900
That place l showed you
on Sycamore Street

04:15.000 --> 04:17.300
was absolutely,
positively loaded with plugs.

04:17.399 --> 04:19.300
That's right.
There were plenty.

04:19.399 --> 04:20.800
But the steps were too high .

04:20.800 --> 04:22.300
When we get older,
we could trip.

04:22.400 --> 04:25.700
Every house we look at
you find something to pick at.

04:25.800 --> 04:27.400
l just know what l like.

04:27.500 --> 04:29.900
Would you like a divorce?
'Cause l'll bring it.

04:30.000 --> 04:32.600
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
No need for that.

04:32.700 --> 04:34.900
l'm gonna find
this house for you .

04:35.000 --> 04:37.400
l am committed to finding
the perfect house for you.

04:37.500 --> 04:38.800
l don't care how long it takes.

04:38.900 --> 04:40.700
Because at Evers & Evers,

04:40.800 --> 04:44.700

04:59.900 --> 05:01.700
lt's another interested party.

05:01.800 --> 05:04.300
Listen , l'm on my way home

We do.
We love it.

05:23.100 --> 05:24.300
Well, then , Mrs. Coleman.

05:24.300 --> 05:25.700
Taking that into consideration ,

05:25.700 --> 05:28.300
there's only one thing
left to do.

05:59.700 --> 06:01.500
Oh, no.

Honey, forgive me.

of Evers & Evers Real Estate.

07:03.100 --> 07:04.700
Tell me about your dream house.

07:06.800 --> 07:08.700
Hi, Sara.
My name's Teddy.

07:08.800 --> 07:10.700
Your husband told me to tell you
he loves you very much,

07:10.800 --> 07:13.200
but sometimes he loses track
of the time.

07:13.300 --> 07:15.000
l'm sorry l'm late.

07:15.100 --> 07:17.200
Happy anniversary.

07:17.300 --> 07:18.800
Happy anniversary.

07:18.900 --> 07:21.100
Yes.

07:22.200 --> 07:24.200
Look at what he brought you.

07:24.300 --> 07:26.100
Look at that.
lsn't that pretty?

07:26.100 --> 07:28.100
Oh, you know, you have
a wonderful husband

07:28.200 --> 07:30.400
that thinks about you like that
on your anniversaries.

07:30.400 --> 07:31.500
You're so fortunate!

07:31.600 --> 07:33.500
lt's beautiful.

07:35.100 --> 07:37.100
lt's actually Teddy's fault
that l'm late.

07:37.100 --> 07:39.100
He had a little accident
in the backseat,

07:39.100 --> 07:41.900
cotton all over the place,
but l cleaned it up.

07:41.900 --> 07:44.600
lt's okay.
l forgive Teddy.

07:44.700 --> 07:46.600
Hey, come on, Sara.
Don't be like that.

07:46.700 --> 07:49.800
l'm on a roll here.
We sold seven houses this month.

07:49.900 --> 07:51.400
What about
the three soccer games,

07:51.400 --> 07:54.200
two birthday parties,
and barbecue you missed?

07:54.300 --> 07:56.600
Did l miss that much stuff
this month?

07:57.400 --> 07:59.800
Okay. We're gonna take off
this weekend .

07:59.900 --> 08:00.700
What?

08:00.700 --> 08:02.800
We're gonna take off
and go down to the lake

08:02.900 --> 08:05.800
like we did last year with
the kids for the whole weekend .

08:05.900 --> 08:08.100
-How's that sound?
-Can we really close on this?

08:08.100 --> 08:10.000
Yes. How about this?
We can close on this.

08:10.100 --> 08:11.600
How about this?

08:12.200 --> 08:14.100
Close on that.
Let me go tell the kids.

08:14.200 --> 08:16.000
All right?
Okay. All right.

08:16.000 --> 08:18.600
Megan and Michael ,
big family adventure!

08:18.700 --> 08:20.700
Hey!
Michael Jordan Evers!

08:20.800 --> 08:22.000
Aah! Aah!

08:22.100 --> 08:23.700
Hey!
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

08:23.800 --> 08:26.200
-Dad ! There's a...
-What is it?

08:26.300 --> 08:28.100
-There's a spider in my room!
-There's a what?

08:28.100 --> 08:30.000
There's a spider in my room
on the window.

08:30.000 --> 08:32.000
Why don't you kill it, man?

08:32.000 --> 08:34.000
That's a big spider!

08:34.000 --> 08:35.600
Come on .
lt's just a spider, Michael.

08:35.700 --> 08:37.600
How big could it be?
What is this?

08:37.700 --> 08:39.799
Where's the spider at?

08:39.799 --> 08:41.900
What? Man, you're acting
like it's Mothra.

08:41.900 --> 08:43.000
lt's just a spider.

08:43.100 --> 08:45.500
You're making a big deal
out of nothing, Michael .

08:45.500 --> 08:46.600
You're 10 years old .

08:46.600 --> 08:49.000
lt's time l teach you how to
kill a spider the right way.

08:49.000 --> 08:51.700
The most efficient way
to crush a spider.

08:51.700 --> 08:54.100
You got to get a good magazine.
Doesn't matter what you use.

08:54.200 --> 08:58.000
Some people like to use ''Life''
or ''Time'' or...

08:59.300 --> 09:01.900
This is my ''Sports lllustrated''
Swimsuit Edition.

09:02.000 --> 09:03.900
What are you doing with it?

09:04.000 --> 09:06.200
-l don't know.
-Yeah, right.

09:06.300 --> 09:08.500
lf you can look at this,
you should have enough courage

09:08.500 --> 09:10.100
to kill a spider the right way.

09:10.100 --> 09:12.800
So l'm gonna roll this up
so you get a good grip on it.

09:12.800 --> 09:15.200
You get a bead on the spider.
You get a side swing.

09:15.300 --> 09:17.200
That's where you can really get
some good action going.

09:17.300 --> 09:19.900
You want to come across like
that so you really crush it.

09:20.000 --> 09:22.800
You come across this way so
you get his whole escape route

09:22.900 --> 09:24.000
in case he try to go...

09:24.000 --> 09:25.600
You take it, and you whack it.

09:25.700 --> 09:27.400
Go on.
Whack the spider.

09:27.500 --> 09:28.900
l don't want to whack it.

09:29.000 --> 09:31.200
Come on, you got to whack
the spider, Mike. Whack it.

09:31.300 --> 09:34.100
Dad, l'm afraid of spiders.
l can't whack it.

09:34.800 --> 09:37.100
Let me explain something to you .

09:37.200 --> 09:40.600
All your life you're gonna be
facing spiders, okay?

09:40.700 --> 09:41.600
l am?

09:41.600 --> 09:45.100
What l'm trying to say is
you should never be afraid .

09:45.200 --> 09:46.900
People know,
they use that against you .

09:47.000 --> 09:48.900
l'm not scared of anything .
l'm your dad, right?

09:49.000 --> 09:50.800
You're my son .
You whack that spider.

09:50.800 --> 09:52.300
l can't whack the spider, Dad.

09:52.300 --> 09:54.800
Come on . Whack it.
You can do it. Whack the spider.

09:54.800 --> 09:57.400
-l don't want to whack it.
-Yes, you can . Come on.

09:57.500 --> 09:59.200
Kill the spider.
Kill the spider.

09:59.200 --> 10:01.400
Dad, l can't crush it.
l can't whack it!

10:02.700 --> 10:03.800
Hey.

10:03.900 --> 10:05.200
There.
Happy?

10:05.300 --> 10:06.800
No, l'm not happy, Megan .

10:06.900 --> 10:08.200
l was trying to make a point

10:08.300 --> 10:10.900
about how it's important
to whack your own spiders!

10:11.000 --> 10:12.900
Whatever.

10:13.500 --> 10:14.200
Mm-hmm.

10:14.300 --> 10:16.800
Past the Old Miller Road.

10:16.900 --> 10:17.900
Okay. Great.

10:18.000 --> 10:20.700
lt is an old home, Ms. Evers.

10:20.800 --> 10:24.100
And my employer is anxious
to move on.

10:24.200 --> 10:27.300
Would it be possible
for you to come alone

10:27.300 --> 10:29.100
to discuss the situation?

10:29.200 --> 10:31.000
But my husband and l work
as a team.

10:31.000 --> 10:34.400
The master usually
does not take visitors.

10:34.500 --> 10:36.500
However, from your photograph,

10:36.600 --> 10:39.600
he thought you to have
a trustworthy face.

10:39.700 --> 10:43.400
About your husband ,
he felt differently.

10:43.500 --> 10:45.700
Oh .
You got our flyer.

10:45.800 --> 10:49.100
The master had wished
to meet you tomorrow evening.

10:49.200 --> 10:50.200
Oh , l'm so sorry.

10:50.300 --> 10:53.300
But tomorrow l've got plans
that can't be broken.

10:53.300 --> 10:54.400
Who is that?

10:54.500 --> 10:55.800
-Excuse me a second .
-Who is that?

10:55.900 --> 10:58.100
Just someone calling
about repping a house.

10:58.200 --> 11:00.400
What's the address?
Where is it?

11:01.700 --> 11:04.200
Sara, do you know
where this place is?

11:04.200 --> 11:06.500
The places up here are big
multimillion-dollar mansions.

11:06.600 --> 11:07.700
This could be big.

11:07.800 --> 11:10.400
And what about
our big family adventure?

11:11.400 --> 11:13.400
JlM:
lt's just a little detour.

11:13.500 --> 11:15.200
How long is it gonna take?

11:15.200 --> 11:17.200
No more than 20 minutes.
20 minutes tops.

11:17.300 --> 11:18.900
You kids should be excited.

11:18.900 --> 11:21.200
You're gonna see Mommy and Daddy
in real-estate action.

11:22.500 --> 11:25.100
Somebody's calling me.
Who's calling me?

11:25.900 --> 11:28.200
Hello. Jim Evers,

11:28.300 --> 11:31.700

11:34.700 --> 11:36.100
Tomorrow?

11:36.200 --> 11:39.200
Wow. l'm kind of out of town
right now.

11:39.300 --> 11:43.000
Hey. But, hey, listen .
Maybe l could come back early.

11:43.100 --> 11:45.400
Oh, no.

11:45.500 --> 11:46.900
No, l can't come back early.

11:47.000 --> 11:48.900
Maybe we should just take care
of this on Monday.

11:49.000 --> 11:50.000
All right?

11:50.100 --> 11:51.100
Monday?

11:51.200 --> 11:52.700
Monday sounds fantastic.

11:52.800 --> 11:54.500
Okay.
l'll talk to you on Monday.

11:54.600 --> 11:56.400
We're gonna talk on Monday.

11:59.900 --> 12:02.100
Are we still in America?

12:04.000 --> 12:07.500
Here it is, right here.
Okay? All right?

12:18.700 --> 12:21.200
Yeah, that's a whole lot
of gate.

12:21.300 --> 12:24.000
They must have a big
possum problem down here.

12:24.000 --> 12:25.700
That's some big possum.

12:33.800 --> 12:34.800
Didn't they know we were coming?

12:34.800 --> 12:36.000
Of course they knew.

12:36.100 --> 12:39.400
Maybe there's a call box
or something.

12:39.500 --> 12:42.200
Hello?!

12:43.600 --> 12:46.200
Hello!
The Evers are here!

12:49.000 --> 12:51.700
Yes, we're here now!

12:53.500 --> 12:55.400
Nobody's answering.

12:55.400 --> 12:58.700
Now l got to get out in the dirt
with my brand-new shoes on.

13:13.100 --> 13:14.700
Wow.

13:16.700 --> 13:18.600
How are we gonna get in?

13:19.300 --> 13:22.200
What if you give me a boost,
and l'll go around the back?

13:22.300 --> 13:23.500
They're probably old .
We'll surprise them.

13:23.600 --> 13:25.100
You'll probably kill them.

13:25.200 --> 13:27.500
Let's just go.
lt's getting late.

13:28.200 --> 13:30.000
You know, Sara,
you give up too easy.

13:30.000 --> 13:33.400
You got to be more patient.
The Evers way is to be patient.

13:42.000 --> 13:43.900
All right.
We're in business.

13:44.000 --> 13:45.900
Let's go, let's go.

13:46.000 --> 13:47.800
Let's do this.

14:24.800 --> 14:26.600
Wow.

14:26.700 --> 14:30.200
Bob Vila would have
a field day with this place.

14:30.300 --> 14:32.400
Hey, Megan ,
don't slam the door like that.

14:32.500 --> 14:34.200
lt's very sensitive.

14:34.300 --> 14:35.700
lt's a car, Dad.

14:35.800 --> 14:37.900
Ah !
lt's not just a car.

14:38.000 --> 14:40.000
lt's a very delicate piece
of machinery.

14:40.100 --> 14:42.400
Shh . She didn't mean
what she just said.

14:42.400 --> 14:44.100
She didn't mean that.

14:44.100 --> 14:45.800
Come on .
Let's see what's around back.

14:45.800 --> 14:47.600
l'm getting hungry.

14:47.600 --> 14:48.600
Me too.

14:48.700 --> 14:50.300
Don't worry.
We'll be 20 minutes tops.

14:50.300 --> 14:52.100
Hey, Dad ,
when we get to the lake,

14:52.100 --> 14:54.800
can l go to that pizza shop
where l ate that whole pizza,

14:54.900 --> 14:56.100
and when we got to the cabin,

14:56.200 --> 14:59.100
l threw up and you still saw
the pepperoni chunks in it?

14:59.200 --> 15:02.500
Yeah , we can go there if we can
avoid a repeat performance.

15:06.600 --> 15:07.600
Wow.

15:07.600 --> 15:09.800
Now, that's something
you don't see every day.

15:09.900 --> 15:13.500
Oh, my God.

15:13.600 --> 15:14.700
Dead people?

15:14.800 --> 15:16.200
Hey, honey.

15:16.300 --> 15:20.100
You know they have, uh ,
dead people in the backyard?

15:20.200 --> 15:22.600
Well , some people have pools.

15:22.600 --> 15:25.300
Some people have private
cemeteries. lt happens.

15:25.300 --> 15:27.900
You're gonna sell a house
with this?

15:28.000 --> 15:30.900
This historical sprawling manor
with spacious grounds? Yes.

15:31.000 --> 15:33.200
Hey, that's good .
We'll put that on the listing.

15:33.300 --> 15:35.000
And leave out
all the dead people?

15:35.100 --> 15:37.700
We'll just stick
to the bright side.

15:37.800 --> 15:40.700
Oh, no.
l got my good suit on.

15:46.400 --> 15:47.200
Oh.

15:47.300 --> 15:48.500
You think it's gonna stop?

15:48.500 --> 15:51.100
Oh , l hope it's not raining
at the lake.

15:51.900 --> 15:53.800
When you're at work
with Mommy and Daddy,

15:53.900 --> 15:56.000
you're always on
your best behavior, right?

15:56.100 --> 15:57.900
Okay.
Whoo!

15:57.900 --> 15:59.800
Look at the size
of these knockers.

15:59.900 --> 16:01.900
Ever see anything
like that before?

16:02.800 --> 16:05.200
Hello?!
Evers Real Estate!

16:07.500 --> 16:10.200
Evers Real Estate!

16:22.600 --> 16:24.200
Hello?

16:25.000 --> 16:27.100
ls anybody home?

16:31.500 --> 16:32.900
Hello?

16:33.000 --> 16:36.700
We're the Evers from
Evers & Evers Real Estate.

16:37.600 --> 16:40.000
Hi!

16:45.800 --> 16:47.700
Have you ever seen
anything like this?

16:47.800 --> 16:48.800
Never.

16:48.900 --> 16:52.100
Sara, this puts us
in a whole new league.

16:53.300 --> 16:55.000
Smells like Grandma's house.

16:55.100 --> 16:57.100
Worse.
Smells like Grandma.

16:57.200 --> 16:58.500
This place is just
a little dusty.

16:58.500 --> 17:00.700
We'll get a cleaning crew to
come out here and shine it up.

17:00.800 --> 17:04.500
This place would be sparkling
from top to bottom.

17:04.599 --> 17:07.900
Mom, this place has spiders.

17:27.800 --> 17:31.000
Sara Evers.

17:31.100 --> 17:32.900
Yes, l'm Sara.

17:33.000 --> 17:36.500
My name is Ramsley.

17:40.400 --> 17:41.500
Hello, Ramsley.

17:41.600 --> 17:44.300
l'm Jim Evers
of Evers & Evers Real Estate

17:44.300 --> 17:46.400
at your service.

17:47.200 --> 17:51.300
We were not expecting ...others.

17:51.400 --> 17:54.600
Yes, we were on our way
out of town .

17:54.700 --> 17:56.800
Yeah, then when we realized
the enormity

17:56.900 --> 17:58.900
and complexity
of your unique estate,

17:59.000 --> 18:00.700
we wanted to commit
the full resources

18:00.800 --> 18:02.200
of Evers & Evers Real Estate.

18:02.300 --> 18:05.200
At Evers & Evers, we want you
to be happy forevers and evers.

18:05.300 --> 18:07.200
Please accept
this waterproof calendar

18:07.200 --> 18:09.900
as a token of our appreciation.

18:13.300 --> 18:14.700
Very well.

18:14.800 --> 18:17.800
We shall have to place
other settings.

18:17.800 --> 18:19.300
Who do you have
the settings for?

18:19.300 --> 18:24.500
Master Gracey wishes to discuss
his affairs over dinner.

18:24.600 --> 18:26.800
Oh, l'm afraid we have plans.

18:26.900 --> 18:28.500
Honey, we can't stay for dinner.

18:28.600 --> 18:30.200
Oh, yes.
But we mustn't be rude, darling.

18:30.300 --> 18:31.900
What about our family adventure?

18:32.000 --> 18:32.900
Yeah, Dad.

18:32.900 --> 18:35.400
We'll just have some soup,
and then we'll get going, okay?

18:35.400 --> 18:36.800
All right?

18:44.500 --> 18:46.200
Wow.

18:58.100 --> 18:59.900
Wow.

19:02.200 --> 19:04.100
Nice.
Very nice.

19:04.200 --> 19:06.400
Good job.
Good job.

19:06.500 --> 19:09.500
Hey, Megan, how'd you like to
eat like this every day at home?

19:11.300 --> 19:15.300
The master will be
with you shortly.

19:17.000 --> 19:18.700
Carry on.

19:23.900 --> 19:26.900
l said, ''Carry on.''
He walks off.

19:30.200 --> 19:32.800
Have you ever seen
a fireplace this amazing?

19:32.900 --> 19:35.000
lncredible.

19:35.100 --> 19:38.600
Ah , we could have one heck of a
wienie roast in that thing, huh?

19:38.700 --> 19:41.200
Seriously.
Look at this detail.

19:41.300 --> 19:42.800
l've never seen
anything like this.

19:42.900 --> 19:46.300
-Haven't you?

19:46.400 --> 19:50.600
My grandfather spared no expense
when he built this mansion.

19:50.700 --> 19:54.000
Well , your grandfather had
really good taste in tchotchkes.

19:54.100 --> 19:55.600
l'm Jim Evers
of Evers & Evers Real Estate.

19:55.700 --> 19:57.800
Charmed to make
your acquaintance, sir.

19:57.800 --> 20:00.700
Edward.
Edward Gracey.

20:07.200 --> 20:09.100
Uh, this is my wife, Sara.

20:09.100 --> 20:11.000
You want to come meet
Mr. Gracey?

20:11.000 --> 20:13.500
Very nice to meet you ,
Mr. Gracey.

20:13.600 --> 20:17.200
And this is our daughter, Megan ,
and our son , Michael.

20:21.100 --> 20:25.000
You have very beautiful
children , Ms. Evers.

20:25.000 --> 20:27.900
l kicked in
some chromosomes, too.

20:29.600 --> 20:32.300
Children.
Madam .

20:32.400 --> 20:34.700
Oh. Nice.

20:34.800 --> 20:36.500
Okay.

20:39.200 --> 20:41.500
Thank you .

20:41.600 --> 20:43.300
The master was very pleased

20:43.300 --> 20:46.700
when he heard you could come
on such short notice.

20:46.800 --> 20:50.500
Normally we would not have
called you here so abruptly.

20:50.500 --> 20:52.500
But we had no other choice.

20:52.600 --> 20:54.500
What do you got,
termites or something?

20:54.500 --> 20:56.700
Big house like this must have
a lot of termites.

20:56.700 --> 21:01.600
No. But lately there have been
more...disturbances.

21:03.000 --> 21:05.200
What do you think
of the house, Ms. Evers?

21:05.300 --> 21:07.400
Oh.

21:07.500 --> 21:09.800
l think it's
absolutely incredible.

21:09.900 --> 21:11.800
The ltalian influence.

21:11.800 --> 21:13.500
The Renaissance style
of the molding.

21:13.600 --> 21:16.100
The attention to detail
is stunning.

21:16.200 --> 21:19.500
You never see houses like this.
Or at least l don't.

21:19.600 --> 21:24.000
Great care and love went into
the building of this mansion.

21:37.000 --> 21:40.600
This house is my inheritance.

21:40.600 --> 21:42.600
My birthright.

21:43.400 --> 21:46.100
But lately it's become
too much to bear.

21:46.600 --> 21:49.300
Tell me, Mr. Evers.

21:49.300 --> 21:52.100
Do you believe in ghosts?

21:52.200 --> 21:53.900
Ghosts?

21:54.000 --> 21:56.700
Yeah. Sure.
l believe in ghosts. Yeah .

21:56.700 --> 21:59.300
l don't think it's a good idea
to put that on the listing.

21:59.400 --> 22:01.400
You should talk about how many
bathrooms are in the house.

22:01.500 --> 22:02.400
People love bathrooms.

22:02.500 --> 22:05.100
We should play up the toilet
angle and leave out ghosts.

22:05.200 --> 22:06.800
l think that'd be best.

22:07.600 --> 22:10.900
The storm has swollen the river.

22:11.000 --> 22:11.800
How's that?

22:11.900 --> 22:15.200
The storm has flooded the road.

22:15.900 --> 22:20.200
l'm afraid there will be
no leaving the mansion tonight.

22:20.300 --> 22:21.800
What?

22:21.900 --> 22:27.800
Of course you are all more than
welcome to spend the night here.

22:27.800 --> 22:29.700
Oh, no.
l really don't think we should.

22:29.800 --> 22:31.700
We've got plans.

22:31.800 --> 22:35.600
l'm afraid there's no other way.

22:35.700 --> 22:39.100
Ramsley will show you
to your rooms.

22:52.800 --> 22:57.400
l believe the children will be
comfortable in this room.

22:59.100 --> 23:01.100
Yeah.
Real homey.

23:01.200 --> 23:03.300
You'll be fine.

23:03.900 --> 23:05.900
Wow.
Hey, listen .

23:06.000 --> 23:08.700
When you flush the toilet, check
and see how quickly it refills.

23:08.800 --> 23:09.800
Good night, Dad.

23:09.900 --> 23:11.400
Good night.

23:16.600 --> 23:21.200
l hope you and the madame will
find this room to your liking.

23:21.300 --> 23:22.400
Yeah.
lt's great.

23:22.500 --> 23:24.600
lt'll be like spending the night
in a fine hotel.

23:24.700 --> 23:27.400
Will there be anything else
that you require, sir?

23:27.500 --> 23:29.200
Are you gonna get us
some chocolates?

23:29.200 --> 23:30.000
Pardon?

23:30.100 --> 23:32.300
You know, the little chocolates
they put on the hotel pillows.

23:32.400 --> 23:34.200
Sometimes they have chocolates
on the pillow.

23:34.300 --> 23:36.700
They have little chocolates
on the pillows...

23:36.800 --> 23:38.500
to have.

23:39.600 --> 23:41.400
What's the problem?

23:45.500 --> 23:46.700
ln the first place,

23:46.700 --> 23:48.500
we weren't even supposed to
be here.

23:48.500 --> 23:49.900
We were supposed to be
at the lake.

23:50.000 --> 23:52.300
What am l supposed to do,
control the weather now, Sara?

23:52.400 --> 23:53.500
That's not the point.

23:53.500 --> 23:55.800
You couldn't resist.
You just had to come.

23:55.900 --> 23:58.800
Excuse me. This is a big
opportunity for all of us.

23:58.800 --> 24:00.800
Not for us, for you.

24:00.900 --> 24:03.600
The only thing you seem to care
about anymore is work.

24:03.600 --> 24:05.600
Oh, but when l'm working hard ,
it doesn't matter

24:05.700 --> 24:08.300
as long as l'm bringing you
home expensive gifts, right?

24:10.700 --> 24:13.000
Hey, what are you ...
Hey, Sara.

24:13.000 --> 24:15.100
Hey, Sara, l didn't
mean to say that, okay?

24:15.200 --> 24:16.500
Sara.

24:16.500 --> 24:17.700
Come on.
Stop it.

24:17.800 --> 24:19.500
Sara.
Sara.

24:19.500 --> 24:23.100
l'm sorry about that, honey.
Can you open up, please?

24:27.400 --> 24:29.400
Aah!
Ooh.

24:29.500 --> 24:30.500
You scared me.

24:31.300 --> 24:33.300
-Pardon the intrusion, sir.
-Yes.

24:33.400 --> 24:36.200
The master was wondering
if he might have a word with you

24:36.200 --> 24:37.300
in the library.

24:37.400 --> 24:39.600
A word? Okay. l'd love to have
a word with him.

24:39.700 --> 24:41.400
Sure.
Let's go talk some turkey.

24:41.500 --> 24:43.600
Yes. Turkey.

24:43.700 --> 24:45.200
-Very good, sir.
-Yeah.

24:45.300 --> 24:47.900
lf you will kindly follow me.

24:48.000 --> 24:49.000
Yeah. Of course.
Of course.

24:49.100 --> 24:51.900
Hey, Sara, l'm gonna have a word
with Mr. Gracey.

24:52.000 --> 24:53.900
l'll be back in a minute.

24:55.800 --> 24:57.300
Ramsley, l was just wondering.

24:57.300 --> 24:58.900
Have you ever been
to a tanning salon?

24:59.000 --> 25:00.900
l've got a friend who's got
a really great place.

25:01.000 --> 25:02.500
You can get a really smooth tan.

25:02.600 --> 25:05.600
Do something about
that ashy white look.

25:05.600 --> 25:07.500
l'm sure the ladies
would love it.

25:07.600 --> 25:10.600
Yes.
Sounds wonderful .

25:12.900 --> 25:16.200
Would you care for a drink, sir,
while you're waiting?

25:16.300 --> 25:18.900
Yeah. Don't mind if l do.
Thank you , Ramsley.

25:19.000 --> 25:21.000
Oh, wow!

25:21.100 --> 25:23.600
Now, that's class.
That's what l need to do.

25:23.700 --> 25:26.100
Get a big picture of myself
to put on the living room wall.

25:26.200 --> 25:28.400
Adds a touch of elegance
to the room.

25:28.500 --> 25:32.400
Yes, sir.
Very elegant.

25:32.400 --> 25:34.900
Thank you .
Thank you so much , Ramsley.

25:37.000 --> 25:38.900
Mmm.

25:38.900 --> 25:40.500
So, Ramsley, how long
you been a butler?

25:40.600 --> 25:42.200
A long time.

25:42.300 --> 25:44.000
What are the most
important qualifications

25:44.100 --> 25:47.200
in case l might be doing
some interviewing?

25:47.200 --> 25:49.800
Attending to every detail.

25:49.900 --> 25:52.200
Understanding priorities.

25:52.200 --> 25:56.900
And above all,
knowing one's place.

25:57.500 --> 25:59.500
What does your boss like to do?
What's he into?

25:59.600 --> 26:02.000
You know, what floats his boat?

26:03.100 --> 26:06.900
The master likes
a great many things.

26:06.900 --> 26:11.600
Art, literature, beauty.

26:11.700 --> 26:13.500
And all that stuff about ghosts.

26:13.600 --> 26:16.400
Did he get, like, a bad clam
in his jambalaya one night?

26:16.500 --> 26:19.400
You don't believe
in ghosts, sir?

26:19.500 --> 26:21.900
Absolutely not.
Let me tell you something.

26:21.900 --> 26:24.400
The way l see it, you only go
around the track once.

26:24.500 --> 26:27.900
So you do it full-out
all the way around.

26:27.900 --> 26:32.100
Mr. Evers, may l confide in you?

26:32.800 --> 26:33.800
Please do.

26:33.800 --> 26:35.800
The master is not well.

26:35.900 --> 26:38.300
He must leave this house,
Mr. Evers.

26:38.300 --> 26:40.200
He must move on.

26:40.200 --> 26:43.900
lt is of the gravest importance,
l assure you.

26:44.000 --> 26:48.300
Or l fear the very worst.

26:50.200 --> 26:52.200
l can't believe this.

26:52.300 --> 26:54.000
Still no reception.

26:54.100 --> 26:56.600
We had to take
that little detour.

26:56.600 --> 26:58.800
20 minutes tops.
Yeah, right.

26:58.800 --> 27:00.800
Do you think it's gonna stop
raining soon?

27:00.800 --> 27:04.000
How should l know?
l'm not the weatherman.

27:05.000 --> 27:06.600
Hmm.

27:08.000 --> 27:09.800
Stogies.

27:11.100 --> 27:12.100
Not bad.

27:12.200 --> 27:15.000
Not at all .
Hold onto that.

27:16.800 --> 27:19.800
Hmm.
Hmm.

27:19.900 --> 27:21.000
Wonderful.

27:21.100 --> 27:24.800
Must be nice.
Must be really nice.

27:24.900 --> 27:26.500
l tell ya.

27:26.600 --> 27:28.300
Ahh.

27:29.700 --> 27:31.400
Hmm.

27:34.600 --> 27:36.300
Hello there, good man .

27:36.300 --> 27:37.800
Ramsley,
fix the gentleman a drink.

27:37.800 --> 27:40.300
Nigel , l just recently returned
from the Continent,

27:40.400 --> 27:42.000
where l found
the most interesting book.

27:42.100 --> 27:44.400
Yes, it was called
''Raising the Dead.''

27:44.400 --> 27:46.400
Oh! Oh, cripes.

27:46.500 --> 27:49.500
Oh.
l hope that doesn't stain.

27:50.300 --> 27:51.700
Oh.

28:01.900 --> 28:03.500
Wow.

28:18.200 --> 28:20.200
lnteresting.

28:26.800 --> 28:28.600
Wow.

28:36.000 --> 28:38.300
Wow.
l wonder where this leads to.

28:38.400 --> 28:39.800
Hey!

28:39.900 --> 28:41.600
Hey!

28:41.700 --> 28:43.700
Hey, open this back up!

28:43.800 --> 28:46.100
Hey, open up!

28:46.200 --> 28:47.100
Ramsley!

28:48.300 --> 28:50.100
Ramsley!

28:50.200 --> 28:52.300
Push back the head !

28:53.100 --> 28:55.700
Hey, will somebody push
the head back?

29:29.000 --> 29:30.700
Megan!

29:36.500 --> 29:38.600
What do you think it is?

29:42.700 --> 29:44.600
lt's a ghost ball.

30:00.500 --> 30:03.100
l think it wants us
to follow it.

30:04.500 --> 30:06.700
l think you're crazy.

30:13.400 --> 30:16.500
lt does.
lt wants us to follow it.

30:31.800 --> 30:33.500
Hey, Megan , wait up!

30:39.800 --> 30:43.000
Where's that scary albino
when you need him?

30:49.300 --> 30:51.400
Oh.
Hello.

30:52.600 --> 30:55.200
Have you seen my husband?

30:59.600 --> 31:01.300
Excuse me.

31:02.200 --> 31:04.000
Wait!

31:05.000 --> 31:06.500
Wait!

31:25.100 --> 31:27.200
Oh, Ramsley.
lt's you.

31:27.300 --> 31:28.600
May l help you?

31:28.600 --> 31:29.700
Yes.

31:29.800 --> 31:31.700
l was just looking
for my husband.

31:31.800 --> 31:33.900
Ah, indeed.

31:33.900 --> 31:36.600
l left him in the library.

31:36.700 --> 31:39.200
Right through there.

31:41.300 --> 31:44.600
Honey, it's late.
Let's not fight anymore.

31:44.700 --> 31:46.200
Come to bed?

31:46.200 --> 31:48.500
Oh !
l'm sorry.

31:48.600 --> 31:50.000
l thought you were my husband.

31:50.100 --> 31:51.300
Can l help you with that?

31:51.300 --> 31:53.900
Ramsley hates it
when l leave things lying about.

31:54.000 --> 31:56.700
Yes.
He seems a bit proper.

31:56.700 --> 31:58.500
He strikes most people that way.

31:58.600 --> 32:01.300
Once you get to know him ,
you'll find that's not the case.

32:01.300 --> 32:03.700
But he's really...

32:05.600 --> 32:07.700
He's really very sweet.

32:07.700 --> 32:09.400
Thank you.

32:09.400 --> 32:11.300
He's been like a father to me.

32:11.400 --> 32:15.200
Mr. Gracey,
may l ask you something?

32:15.300 --> 32:18.200
Yes. Of course.
Anything.

32:18.300 --> 32:19.400
This house.

32:19.500 --> 32:21.800
lt's been in your family
for generations.

32:21.800 --> 32:24.300
lt's your home.

32:24.400 --> 32:26.800
Why do you want to sell it?

32:28.200 --> 32:33.000
These walls are filled
with so many memories.

32:33.000 --> 32:37.300
Some of them painful.

32:39.800 --> 32:44.200
l think for you to understand ,
l really must show you.

32:45.700 --> 32:49.300
lt's all right.
There's nothing to be afraid of.

32:52.300 --> 32:54.100
Although it might be
a bit worn and faded

32:54.200 --> 32:55.900
from its original grandeur,

32:56.000 --> 32:59.100
this house was once filled
with so many things.

32:59.200 --> 33:00.700
So much life.

33:00.800 --> 33:06.600
With grand parties, dancing,
laughter, and, above all, hope.

33:06.600 --> 33:09.400
Being a Gracey meant
that you were denied nothing.

33:09.500 --> 33:11.200
The world was yours.

33:11.300 --> 33:14.200
What happened here, Mr. Gracey?

33:14.200 --> 33:15.300
She did.

33:15.400 --> 33:17.400
Who?

33:17.500 --> 33:19.300
Elizabeth.

33:19.300 --> 33:23.200
Hers is the story
that haunts these walls.

33:48.200 --> 33:50.000
Come on.

33:50.100 --> 33:52.200
Megan, wait.

33:52.300 --> 33:54.800
You don't know the last time
that thing's been inspected.

33:54.800 --> 33:58.800
Would you just relax?
Where's your sense of adventure?

34:09.900 --> 34:12.100
This is against
all my better judgment.

34:45.600 --> 34:47.500
Hi!

34:52.000 --> 34:54.000
ls anyone home?

35:13.700 --> 35:16.500
Those must be termites.

35:18.500 --> 35:20.600
Some big-ass termites.
That's all.

36:19.200 --> 36:21.100
Hello?

36:37.200 --> 36:38.000
-Oh!

36:38.000 --> 36:39.600
Oh.

36:40.900 --> 36:44.100
Aah! Aah!

37:15.300 --> 37:16.900
Megan!

37:23.500 --> 37:25.400
Mom.

37:25.500 --> 37:27.800
What are you doing here?
You're not supposed to be here!

37:27.900 --> 37:30.400
This is unspeakable!
Unspeakable! You have to leave!

37:30.500 --> 37:33.200
-Who is that?
-That's none of your business.

37:33.300 --> 37:35.600
Now, come on. Get out of here.
lt's way past your bedtime.

37:35.700 --> 37:36.900
Her name was Elizabeth.

37:37.000 --> 37:39.200
Are you kids hungry?
Does anybody want a cookie?

37:39.200 --> 37:40.600
Cookies?!

37:40.700 --> 37:43.200
Don't offer them cookies!
They're trespassers!

37:43.200 --> 37:45.400
Trespassers don't get cookies!

37:45.500 --> 37:47.000
This is none of their concern .

37:47.100 --> 37:48.900
lt is their concern!
They're involved!

37:51.200 --> 37:53.200
Hide! Hide!

38:04.600 --> 38:08.000
The children are not
in their room.

38:08.100 --> 38:09.500
Have you seen them?

38:09.500 --> 38:11.300
Children?
What children?

38:11.300 --> 38:13.900
What children?

38:20.000 --> 38:21.400
Her children.

38:21.500 --> 38:24.900
The children
she wasn't supposed to bring.

38:25.000 --> 38:28.700
Along with that brainless
husband of hers.

38:29.500 --> 38:31.000
Thank you.

38:38.700 --> 38:40.600
lf l had to listen
to another word

38:40.700 --> 38:44.200
from that insufferable fool,
l think l would have burst.

38:44.200 --> 38:47.300
Of course, sir.
What a fool!

38:47.400 --> 38:49.600
Did l not tell her
to come alone?

38:49.600 --> 38:52.700
ls it really too much to ask
for a little cooperation?

38:52.800 --> 38:53.800
A little order?

38:53.900 --> 38:56.100
Of course not, sir.

38:56.200 --> 39:00.300
lf you find the children ,
bring them to me.

39:00.400 --> 39:01.800
-Certainly, sir.
-Yes, sir.

39:01.900 --> 39:04.700
The final arrangements
have been made.

39:04.700 --> 39:08.400
Nothing further will interfere
with the master's plan.

39:18.800 --> 39:22.200
Thank God l heard your voice.
l lost my way.

39:22.300 --> 39:23.600
l don't know how to get out
of here.

39:23.700 --> 39:25.500
l'm sorry if l sound
a little frazzled.

39:25.600 --> 39:28.000
l just had myself
a little freak show back there.

39:28.100 --> 39:29.900
lt's time to respond.

39:29.900 --> 39:31.700
l was supposed to meet
with Mr. Gracey.

39:31.800 --> 39:34.200
But l got stuck in the wall.

39:34.200 --> 39:37.600
Goblins and ghoulies
from last Halloween,

39:37.600 --> 39:41.200
awaken the spirits
with your tambourine.

39:41.300 --> 39:44.100
Okay, l hear you, but l don't
see you. Where are you?

39:44.200 --> 39:50.400
l am Madame Leota, seer of all,
voice to the spirits.

39:50.500 --> 39:52.800
Whom do you seek?

39:55.200 --> 39:56.700
Hey! Hey!

39:56.800 --> 39:58.000
Hey, let me out of here!

39:58.100 --> 40:00.500
Silence!
Whom do you seek?

40:00.600 --> 40:02.400
l am seeking a way out of here.

40:02.500 --> 40:04.100
Then you must look within.

40:04.200 --> 40:05.700
l don't want to look within .
l want to look without.

40:05.800 --> 40:07.700
There is great evil
in this house.

40:07.800 --> 40:10.800
A devil's curse.
lt seeks to destroy you.

40:10.800 --> 40:12.200
Why would something seek
to destroy me?

40:12.200 --> 40:13.600
l'm just here to sell the house.

40:13.600 --> 40:17.000
Dark spirits from the grave,
come forth.

40:17.100 --> 40:20.400
Lift us from the black
and show us.

40:20.500 --> 40:22.400
Show us the way back.

40:22.400 --> 40:24.200
Dark spirits?
Hey, no dark spirits.

40:24.300 --> 40:25.700
Don't you make no dark spirits
come out.

40:25.700 --> 40:28.700
Lift us.
Lift us up to the light.

40:28.800 --> 40:31.700
And lead us through
this stormy night.

40:31.700 --> 40:34.000
Hey, hey, hey.
Hey!

40:34.100 --> 40:36.200
Hey, l'd really like to stay
on the ground.

40:36.300 --> 40:38.300
l'd rather stay on the ground .
Can l stay on the ground?

40:38.400 --> 40:41.500
Evil and darkness have fallen
this night.

40:41.600 --> 40:44.900
But now to survive,
you must gain new sight.

40:45.000 --> 40:46.600
l must first gain new underwear.

40:46.700 --> 40:49.100
Only the light will lead
the way.

40:49.200 --> 40:51.500
Follow it and find
your way home.

40:51.600 --> 40:55.000
There's no place like home.
There's no place like home.

40:55.100 --> 40:57.900
Go, Mr. Evers.
Your family is at stake.

40:57.900 --> 41:01.300
Your very life is at stake.
Break the curse.

41:01.400 --> 41:04.300
There is no escape for you
unless you lift this spell.

41:04.400 --> 41:06.100
Go.
Save yourself.

41:06.200 --> 41:07.900
Save your family.

41:07.900 --> 41:10.800
Release her.
Release us all!

41:10.900 --> 41:13.100
l'm getting so queasy.
l'm getting very queasy.

41:20.300 --> 41:22.200
Oh !

41:27.600 --> 41:31.400
Aah! Aah!

41:48.300 --> 41:50.200
Aah! Aah!

41:51.600 --> 41:53.800
Aah!

41:59.400 --> 42:00.800
Oh!

42:07.100 --> 42:08.800
-Dad!
-Dad!

42:08.900 --> 42:10.500
Hey!
Michael and Megan, you okay?

42:10.600 --> 42:11.800
We're fine, thanks.

42:11.800 --> 42:13.500
Get your things.
Let's get out of here.

42:13.600 --> 42:14.500
We have a problem.

42:14.600 --> 42:16.600
Because of the rain?
We're gonna get a little wet.

42:16.700 --> 42:18.700
Let's just find your mom
and get out of here.

42:18.800 --> 42:21.300
l'm afraid that's not possible.
She can't leave.

42:21.400 --> 42:22.400
And why not?

42:22.500 --> 42:23.500
Because she can't!

42:23.500 --> 42:27.000
lf l could tell you, l would.
But l can't, so l won't, okay?

42:27.000 --> 42:28.700
Hey, how'd you ...

42:29.600 --> 42:30.500
Hey, look.
Come on.

42:30.600 --> 42:32.700
Daddy's having
more hallucinations. Let's go.

42:32.800 --> 42:34.600
-They're ghosts, Dad .
-They're not ghosts.

42:34.700 --> 42:37.000
We're just having hallucinations
from that dinner we ate.

42:37.100 --> 42:39.200
lt was that chicken .
lt didn't taste right.

42:39.300 --> 42:40.600
-Oh!
-lt's not the chicken!

42:40.600 --> 42:43.100
All right. lt's not the chicken.
But we're getting out of here.

42:43.100 --> 42:44.400
But we have to help them.

42:44.500 --> 42:47.500
You can't help the dead, honey.
They're beyond help.

42:47.600 --> 42:48.900
The man's talking sense.

42:48.900 --> 42:51.400
Everyone should keep their noses
in their own business.

42:51.500 --> 42:53.300
But we have to help them
break the curse.

42:53.400 --> 42:55.200
Why is everybody talking
about a curse?

42:55.300 --> 42:57.500
Have you been talking
to that crazy green gypsy

42:57.600 --> 42:58.700
in the giant paperweight?

42:58.800 --> 43:00.400
We've got to go back to see her.

43:00.500 --> 43:02.900
-No back. l'm not going back.
-But, Dad!

43:02.900 --> 43:04.800
They had me floating
all around the room.

43:04.900 --> 43:06.600
Hey, l was strapped to a chair,

43:06.600 --> 43:08.600
floating around the room
with a marching band chasing me.

43:08.700 --> 43:10.400
l'm not going back anywhere!
Forget it, Casper!

43:10.400 --> 43:12.600
But Mom's in trouble.

43:12.700 --> 43:14.300
What kind of trouble?

43:26.900 --> 43:31.700
She died here in this house.

43:31.700 --> 43:34.100
She was so very young.

43:34.200 --> 43:37.500
So very beautiful.

43:37.600 --> 43:41.500
She was in love with the heir
to this mansion.

43:41.600 --> 43:43.300
Your grandfather.

43:43.400 --> 43:48.300
And he loved her
more than life itself.

43:48.900 --> 43:54.900
But they were from different
worlds and couldn't be together.

43:57.400 --> 44:00.200
How did she die, Mr. Gracey?

44:00.300 --> 44:02.400
She took her own life.

44:02.500 --> 44:04.100
Poison.

44:04.200 --> 44:08.100
After that,
his life became unbearable.

44:08.200 --> 44:13.100
And so, without hope,
without love,

44:13.200 --> 44:16.300
without Elizabeth,

44:16.400 --> 44:18.700
he hung himself.

44:20.300 --> 44:26.800
His soul wanders these halls,
waiting for her to return.

44:29.500 --> 44:32.400
lf you listen carefully,

44:32.500 --> 44:38.700
you can still hear the beating
of his broken heart.

44:47.700 --> 44:49.200
Wait a minute.
Hold it a second.

44:49.200 --> 44:50.800
You're telling me
this guy is dead

44:50.900 --> 44:52.200
and the reason
we were brought here

44:52.300 --> 44:54.200
is he wants to try to get jiggy
with my wife?

44:54.200 --> 44:56.800
Pretty much.
Are you upset?

44:56.900 --> 44:59.600
The guy is dead , and he's
trying to get with my wife!

44:59.600 --> 45:01.100
And the house isn't really
for sale!

45:01.200 --> 45:03.200
Yes, l'm upset!

45:03.200 --> 45:06.300
Oh, Madame Leota, is it her?

45:06.400 --> 45:10.200
ls she truly our dear, departed
Elizabeth come back to us?

45:10.200 --> 45:13.200
lt is true.
She walks these halls.

45:13.300 --> 45:15.300
You see?
l told you it is her!

45:15.300 --> 45:17.600
But do not be deceived.

45:17.600 --> 45:20.300
All things are not
as they appear.

45:20.500 --> 45:23.700
For the curse to be lifted ,
the truth must be known.

45:23.700 --> 45:27.000
And for the truth to be known ,
you must find the key.

45:27.100 --> 45:29.200
What are you talking about,
ball lady? What key?

45:29.200 --> 45:31.800
Enter the tomb
under the great dead oak

45:31.900 --> 45:34.400
and travel down deep
under the ground.

45:34.500 --> 45:37.800
And there you will find the key
that must be found.

45:37.900 --> 45:40.700
Find the black crypt
that bears no name,

45:40.800 --> 45:43.600
or soon your fate will be
the same.

45:43.700 --> 45:45.500
You're telling me all l have to
do is find this key,

45:45.500 --> 45:47.800
then l'm gonna walk out of here
with my wife and kids?

45:47.900 --> 45:50.800
The key is the answer to all .

45:50.800 --> 45:52.700
Well, great. l'm in .
Let's get this key.

45:52.800 --> 45:54.600
There's only one problem.

45:54.700 --> 45:56.300
How do we get out of here?

45:56.400 --> 45:58.300
Yeah, how do we get out of here?

45:58.400 --> 46:04.000
Well, there's always, uh ,
my way.

46:10.200 --> 46:13.200
Hey! l thought you said
you could drive this thing!

46:13.300 --> 46:15.700
Don't you worry.
l know exactly what l'm doing.

46:16.800 --> 46:18.400
-Aah!
-Aah!

46:21.100 --> 46:23.300
Well, you better just keep
your eyes on the road!

46:23.300 --> 46:25.000
-Move over!
-What are you doing?

46:25.000 --> 46:27.100
lf you keep driving ,
you'll kill us all!

46:27.200 --> 46:28.300
That's where you're wrong.

46:28.400 --> 46:30.200
Because some of us
are already dead!

46:35.900 --> 46:37.500
Dad, look.

46:54.900 --> 46:57.700
Ready?
Fire!

47:14.000 --> 47:14.800
Dad?

47:14.900 --> 47:15.700
Yes, son?

47:15.700 --> 47:18.200
l see dead people.

47:24.400 --> 47:25.700
Excuse me.

47:25.700 --> 47:28.000
Why are all these ghosts
still hanging around here?

47:28.100 --> 47:30.400
When they died ,
they couldn't find the light.

47:30.500 --> 47:32.000
And now...

47:32.000 --> 47:33.900
Now they're trapped.

47:34.000 --> 47:37.800
Doomed to wander the Earth
for all eternity.

47:41.600 --> 47:44.000
Nice.
Nice job.

47:57.400 --> 47:59.100
Whoa!

48:00.500 --> 48:02.100
Okay.

48:02.100 --> 48:03.100
Hey!

48:03.200 --> 48:05.000
Hey, what are you doing here?

48:05.100 --> 48:06.600
Can they see us?

48:06.700 --> 48:08.500
No.
Of course not.

48:08.500 --> 48:11.400
Yes, l can. l'm looking at you
right now in your stupid hat.

48:11.400 --> 48:13.900
Don't listen to him.
He's lying.

48:15.400 --> 48:18.500
Whatever. Come on, kids.
Let's go. Come on.

48:19.300 --> 48:23.000
l could swear he was looking
right at me.

48:23.000 --> 48:25.200
He's psychic.

48:29.400 --> 48:32.400
This was to have been
her wedding dress.

48:32.400 --> 48:34.300
Oh, it's lovely.

48:34.400 --> 48:38.400
lt would have been lovelier if
she'd had a chance to wear it.

48:38.500 --> 48:42.400
Now it serves
only as a dark reminder

48:42.500 --> 48:44.100
of what could have been.

48:44.200 --> 48:48.000
To love someone so much
and then lose them so suddenly.

48:48.000 --> 48:50.600
l can't imagine how awful
that must be.

48:50.700 --> 48:53.700
lf you truly love someone,
they never leave you.

48:53.800 --> 48:57.000
They remain in your heart
forever.

48:59.700 --> 49:01.500
lsn't that romantic?

49:01.600 --> 49:04.100
He was willing to throw
everything away for love.

49:04.200 --> 49:07.000
Well, now he's broke, dead ,
and cursed. Nice move.

49:07.100 --> 49:09.200
-Oh, crap!

49:09.200 --> 49:10.800
These are my new shoes.

49:10.800 --> 49:12.200
Hey, kids, watch your step.

49:12.200 --> 49:13.500
-Oh, crap!

49:13.600 --> 49:15.000
Hey, Michael, don't say ''crap.''

49:15.000 --> 49:16.400
All right.
Where is this place?

49:16.500 --> 49:17.600
Okay, where are we?

49:17.700 --> 49:19.400
l think the gypsy lady
said something

49:19.500 --> 49:21.100
about making a left at an oak.

49:21.200 --> 49:24.500
Okay.
Well , glad she was so specific.

49:29.500 --> 49:32.100
What is that?
Do you hear that?

49:32.200 --> 49:33.700
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

49:33.800 --> 49:36.000
<i># And harmonize #</i>

49:36.100 --> 49:40.100
<i># When we ghosts come out</i>
<i>to socialize #</i>

49:40.200 --> 49:41.800
<i># Doom, doom, doom, doom #</i>

49:41.900 --> 49:43.700
<i># When the cryptos creak</i>
<i>and the tombstones quake #</i>

49:43.800 --> 49:46.000
<i># Spooks come out</i>
<i>for a swinging wake #</i>

49:46.100 --> 49:47.300
Excuse me.
Sorry to bother you.

49:47.400 --> 49:49.400
But we were wondering
if you happen to know

49:49.500 --> 49:50.700
where the mausoleum was.

49:50.800 --> 49:52.200
<i># Down by the #</i>

49:52.300 --> 49:55.900
<i># Old mill stream #</i>

49:56.000 --> 49:58.600
<i># Where l first met you #</i>

49:58.700 --> 50:01.600
No, no. l think they said
it was an old oak.

50:01.600 --> 50:03.200
That's what they said .
lt's by the...

50:03.200 --> 50:04.200
<i># By the light #</i>

50:04.300 --> 50:05.900
<i># By the light,</i>
<i>by the light #</i>

50:06.000 --> 50:08.800
<i># Of the silvery moon #</i>

50:08.900 --> 50:11.000
Yeah. You sound really good .
Your harmony's tight.

50:11.100 --> 50:13.600
But we're trying to find
my wife. She'll be...

50:13.700 --> 50:16.100
<i># Comin' 'round the mountain</i>
<i>when she comes #</i>

50:16.100 --> 50:17.700
<i># She'll be comin' 'round</i>
<i>the mountain... #</i>

50:17.700 --> 50:19.800
Listen, guys.
l'm trying to find a key.

50:19.800 --> 50:21.200
l'm trying to find a key...

50:21.300 --> 50:23.700
<i># Where's the key?</i>
<i>Where's the key? #</i>

50:23.700 --> 50:24.900
<i># Where's the beautiful key? #</i>

50:25.000 --> 50:26.400
<i># Find the key, find the key #</i>

50:26.400 --> 50:27.500
<i># Oh, how happy you'll be #</i>

50:27.500 --> 50:30.600
The key that l'm trying to find
is in the mausoleum.

50:30.700 --> 50:32.500
The key is in the mausoleum.

50:32.600 --> 50:35.400
<i># You left your key #</i>

50:35.400 --> 50:38.000
<i># ln a mausoleum #</i>

50:38.100 --> 50:39.400
<i># Down in Dixie #</i>

50:39.500 --> 50:41.200
Dad, there it is!

50:41.300 --> 50:43.300
- <i># Dad, there it is #</i>
-Thanks.

50:43.400 --> 50:47.700
- <i># Dad, there it is #</i>
-Thanks for nothing.

50:52.100 --> 50:54.400
Okay.
We made it.

50:57.900 --> 51:00.100
All right, kids.
Stay close.

51:07.100 --> 51:08.200
Hey.

51:14.300 --> 51:16.400
Look.

51:16.500 --> 51:17.700
lt's a warning.

51:18.800 --> 51:20.300
Now, how do you know that?

51:20.400 --> 51:22.900
l studied Latin
for three years, Dad.

51:23.000 --> 51:24.700
You thought it was dumb,
remember?

51:24.800 --> 51:26.600
You said it was a dead language.

51:26.700 --> 51:29.600
Oh , we see how wrong l was
about that.

51:29.600 --> 51:32.900
''Beware all who enter.

51:32.900 --> 51:36.700
Here lies the passage
to the dead.''

51:37.500 --> 51:39.800
Hey! Hey, hey, hey!
Where are you going?

51:39.900 --> 51:42.400
-l don't like Latin .
-Hey, wait. Michael.

51:42.400 --> 51:44.700
You're 1 0 years old now.
You got to start being a man.

51:44.800 --> 51:47.800
l just turned 1 0.
l'm still getting used to it.

51:51.300 --> 51:52.500
Okay.
Here's what we do.

51:52.600 --> 51:54.300
Megan, stay here
with your brother.

51:54.300 --> 51:55.000
What?

51:55.100 --> 51:57.500
l'm not gonna leave him
out here by himself.

51:57.500 --> 51:58.900
You guys stay together.

51:59.000 --> 52:01.100
l'll go in here,
and l'll take care of this.

52:01.100 --> 52:02.900
Okay.

52:03.000 --> 52:04.800
All right.

52:08.400 --> 52:09.900
Okay.

52:17.300 --> 52:18.900
Oh.

52:19.800 --> 52:22.300
Wow.

52:25.900 --> 52:27.500
Okay.

52:27.500 --> 52:29.200
All right.

52:33.100 --> 52:35.600
Okay.
l'll be right back.

52:35.600 --> 52:38.300
20 minutes tops, right?

52:38.300 --> 52:40.800
20 minutes tops.

53:22.200 --> 53:25.300
What was it that gypsy
told me to look for?

53:25.400 --> 53:28.400
Look for a crypt with ...

53:28.400 --> 53:30.700
Look for a crypt...

53:30.800 --> 53:32.800
-A crypt without a name.
-Aah !

53:32.900 --> 53:34.900
Oh !
What's the matter with you?

53:35.000 --> 53:37.400
You can't just be popping out
like that.

53:37.500 --> 53:39.000
l thought l told you
to wait with Michael.

53:39.000 --> 53:41.400
l was worried
you wouldn't find it.

53:41.500 --> 53:44.300
Besides, Michael's fine.

53:44.300 --> 53:47.100
She said, ''Find the black crypt
with no name,

53:47.200 --> 53:49.200
or soon your fate will be
the same.''

53:56.400 --> 53:58.000
That must be it.

53:58.100 --> 54:00.300
Good hunch, Dad.

54:03.600 --> 54:05.800
l'm officially starting
to get sick of this place.

54:05.900 --> 54:08.100
And we're here 'cause of who?

54:08.100 --> 54:11.200
Because l take seriously my
responsibility as breadwinner.

54:11.300 --> 54:13.600
l want you guys to have
everything l never had before.

54:13.700 --> 54:15.500
l didn't know you had
a bad childhood .

54:15.500 --> 54:16.900
l didn't have a bad childhood .

54:17.000 --> 54:19.000
Then why do we have to have
what you didn't have?

54:19.000 --> 54:20.800
Because...

54:20.800 --> 54:22.100
Hey, don't be tricking me,

54:22.200 --> 54:25.000
you little Latin-speaking
1 3-year-old .

54:25.100 --> 54:27.300
Let's just get this over with.
Hold this.

54:27.400 --> 54:29.700
Hold it with two hands, now.

54:43.400 --> 54:46.400
Aah! Phew!

54:48.400 --> 54:51.000
Oh, man .

54:53.200 --> 54:55.000
Excuse me one second.

54:55.100 --> 54:57.400
l'm sorry to bother you.

54:58.600 --> 55:00.600
Oh!

55:00.700 --> 55:03.100
Aah. Ugh.

55:03.200 --> 55:05.600
Oh, no.
Ew.

55:05.700 --> 55:08.900
Aah.

55:12.400 --> 55:14.100
Okay.
All right.

55:14.100 --> 55:16.700
Now, that wasn't hard, was it?

55:16.800 --> 55:18.300
Let's get out of here.

55:21.100 --> 55:22.900
That gypsy had me thinking
it was gonna be hard.

55:23.000 --> 55:24.800
-That was easy.

55:29.000 --> 55:30.400
Oh! Oh!

55:30.500 --> 55:31.900
Oh, no.

55:32.900 --> 55:34.800
Oh! Oh, no!

55:37.100 --> 55:39.500
Go get the key!
l'll take care of him!

55:41.500 --> 55:44.100
Hey, man, go on back to bed .
Get back in your bed.

55:44.200 --> 55:45.400
Go back to bed .

55:45.500 --> 55:47.600
l'm Jim Evers
of Evers & Evers Real Estate.

55:47.600 --> 55:49.300
Hey, look,
l don't want no trouble, man.

55:49.400 --> 55:51.600
The gypsy told me it was
all right to get the key, so --

55:51.700 --> 55:53.000
Oh!

55:54.200 --> 55:56.800
Just lighten up.
Now, let me tell you something.

55:56.900 --> 55:59.700
l got to get my wife.
l don't want no trouble.

55:59.700 --> 56:01.700
Seriously, back up!

56:05.200 --> 56:07.000
You asked for it.

56:10.900 --> 56:12.300
Next time you're gonna
think twice

56:12.400 --> 56:15.300
before coming back
from the dead , ain't you?

56:15.400 --> 56:17.900
-Did you get the key?
-l'm looking ! l'm looking!

56:18.000 --> 56:20.600
Take your time. Relax.
l have everything under control.

56:20.700 --> 56:23.200
l have everything
completely under control.

56:28.200 --> 56:30.000
Megan , you better look faster!

56:30.000 --> 56:32.600
Oh , l don't want to do this.

56:41.400 --> 56:43.400
Jeez.

57:09.500 --> 57:10.800
Aah!

57:13.600 --> 57:15.100

57:27.800 --> 57:29.700
Give me your hand.

57:33.600 --> 57:35.900
Okay.

Come on, guys!
Hurry up!

57:44.600 --> 57:46.400
Michael!
Michael , open the door.

57:46.500 --> 57:49.000
Michael, it's locked
from the outside!

57:49.000 --> 57:51.700
Michael, open the door.
Open the door. Michael!

57:51.800 --> 57:54.500
Dad, there's spiders everywhere,
and l don't have a magazine.

57:54.600 --> 57:56.400
-Hey, Michael , are you scared?
-Uh-huh.

57:56.500 --> 57:59.500
Michael, it's okay to be scared.
Everybody gets scared sometimes.

57:59.600 --> 58:01.300
-Daddy's scared right now.
-You are?

58:01.300 --> 58:03.600
Yes, l'm very scared .
Now, please open the door, son!

58:03.700 --> 58:06.400
Michael , open the door,
or l'll kill you!

58:06.500 --> 58:07.500
That's great.
Keep him calm.

58:07.600 --> 58:09.600
Hey, Michael, listen ,
it's okay to get scared.

58:09.600 --> 58:11.300
Everybody gets scared
now and then.

58:11.400 --> 58:12.700
You just can't let it stop you.

58:12.700 --> 58:14.500
Michael, if you think
you're scared now,

58:14.500 --> 58:15.900
wait till the zombies come out!

58:16.000 --> 58:17.300
What zombies?

58:17.300 --> 58:18.400
Michael!
Hey, Michael, look.

58:18.400 --> 58:20.100
Just open the door.
Please, man.

58:20.200 --> 58:21.300
Open the door right now.

58:21.400 --> 58:22.500
Dad, they're coming !

58:24.200 --> 58:25.700
Michael , open the door
right now!

58:25.800 --> 58:29.200
Open the door!
Open the door!

58:29.300 --> 58:32.200
Open the door right now!
Open the door!

58:33.100 --> 58:34.700
Oh!

58:39.200 --> 58:40.700
Aah!

58:41.500 --> 58:43.800
Lock it! Lock it!

58:43.900 --> 58:46.000
Okay.
Come on !

58:46.100 --> 58:47.200
All right.

58:47.200 --> 58:49.600
Okay. All right.
Get 'em off!

58:49.700 --> 58:51.700
Okay. Come on.
Get 'em off. Okay.

58:51.800 --> 58:54.100
All right. We got it.
All right. You okay?

58:54.200 --> 58:55.200
Okay.

58:55.300 --> 58:57.300
My brave little man.
All right.

58:57.400 --> 58:58.500
All right.
You okay?

58:58.600 --> 59:00.600
Yeah .
You got the key?

59:02.300 --> 59:04.200
Oh, no.

59:04.900 --> 59:06.400
Wait. Whoa.
Yeah, l got it. l got it.

59:06.500 --> 59:08.500
There it is.
Okay.

59:08.600 --> 59:09.500
All right.

59:09.600 --> 59:11.900
Now, we went to hell and back
to get this thing.

59:12.000 --> 59:13.200
Where's the door out of here?

59:13.200 --> 59:15.900
First, you must find the trunk.

59:16.000 --> 59:16.800
Trunk?

59:16.900 --> 59:18.500
Yes, trunk.

59:18.600 --> 59:19.700
Not door?

59:19.700 --> 59:22.500
No. Not door.
Trunk.

59:22.600 --> 59:25.900
All you said l had to do was
find this key! l got the key.

59:26.000 --> 59:27.800
Now you're telling me this story
about a trunk!

59:27.900 --> 59:29.500
The key is the answer to all,
remember?

59:29.500 --> 59:32.500
Look, l don't make the rules.
l just work here.

59:32.600 --> 59:34.500
Okay. That's it.
That's the last straw.

59:34.600 --> 59:36.400
l've had enough
of this nonsense.

59:36.500 --> 59:38.800
Hey, what are you doing?!
Put me down!

59:38.900 --> 59:41.300
This is bad luck!
This is very bad luck!

59:41.400 --> 59:43.500
l'll show you bad luck.
l'm tired of playing around.

59:43.600 --> 59:45.000
l'm getting nauseous!

59:45.100 --> 59:46.900
You'll get over it.

59:47.600 --> 59:49.000
Please don't drop me.

59:49.100 --> 59:51.200
l'm fragile.
l'm very fragile.

59:51.300 --> 59:52.600
Don't talk to me
about being fragile.

59:52.600 --> 59:55.000
l'm the one that's feeling
fragile right now.

59:58.700 --> 59:59.600
ls that it?

59:59.700 --> 01:00:01.400
-That's it.
-Hmm. All right.

01:00:01.500 --> 01:00:03.500
Now we're in business.

01:00:04.600 --> 01:00:06.900
Hey, hold her for a second.

01:00:09.900 --> 01:00:12.500
All right.
Okay.

01:00:12.600 --> 01:00:14.400
Okay.

01:00:28.200 --> 01:00:31.000
How do l know what to look for?
This thing is full of junk.

01:00:31.100 --> 01:00:33.800
Find the thing that must be read

01:00:33.900 --> 01:00:36.700
lest your heart be filled
with dread .

01:00:36.800 --> 01:00:39.100
There's nothing in here red.

01:00:42.200 --> 01:00:44.800
Hey, wait a minute.
There's a letter here.

01:00:44.900 --> 01:00:46.700
lt's a letter.

01:00:48.900 --> 01:00:51.500
''Yes, my dear heart,
l will marry you.

01:00:51.500 --> 01:00:53.600
l will love you
for all eternity.

01:00:53.600 --> 01:00:56.100
And tonight at last,
we will be together.

01:00:56.100 --> 01:00:57.200
l do.

01:00:57.200 --> 01:01:00.300
Forever yours, Elizabeth.''

01:01:00.400 --> 01:01:01.900
She didn't kill herself.

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:04.000
She wanted to be with him.

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:06.500
Yeah, and somebody gave him
the wrong letter.

01:01:06.600 --> 01:01:09.100
Yes.
Well done, Mr. Evers.

01:01:09.200 --> 01:01:11.800
l must say l'm impressed.

01:01:11.900 --> 01:01:15.800
You are more persistent
than l would have ever imagined.

01:01:15.800 --> 01:01:19.000
The butler did it?
You got to be kidding me.

01:01:19.100 --> 01:01:23.100
l will deal with you two later.

01:01:24.700 --> 01:01:26.600
Why'd you kill her?

01:01:26.600 --> 01:01:29.600
Because the master
would not listen to reason.

01:01:29.600 --> 01:01:30.900
He had everything in the world.

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:34.900
And yet he was willing
to throw it all away for love.

01:01:34.900 --> 01:01:38.500
l did tell him
it would end badly.

01:01:38.600 --> 01:01:40.400
You're a real cold dude.

01:01:40.500 --> 01:01:43.900
No, Mr. Evers.
l am a rational man.

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:46.600
lt was my responsibility
to the house.

01:01:46.700 --> 01:01:48.700
My duty, sir, to see to it

01:01:48.800 --> 01:01:52.900
that the boy did not make
a foolish error in judgment.

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:57.300
Running away with that girl
would have destroyed this house.

01:01:57.300 --> 01:01:59.400
lt would have destroyed
everything .

01:01:59.500 --> 01:02:03.200
And l could not stand by
and watch it all fall to ruin.

01:02:03.200 --> 01:02:04.700
Punch his face in, Dad.

01:02:04.800 --> 01:02:07.400
Yeah, but first l'm gonna tell
his master what really happened.

01:02:07.400 --> 01:02:09.200
The master must never know.

01:02:09.300 --> 01:02:12.000
Edward and his love
will be reunited,

01:02:12.100 --> 01:02:14.000
and this curse will be broken.

01:02:14.100 --> 01:02:15.600
That's not her.
That's my wife.

01:02:15.600 --> 01:02:18.200
And what she sees in you
l'll never know.

01:02:18.300 --> 01:02:20.700
But that is
of little importance now.

01:02:20.800 --> 01:02:25.100
The only thing that matters is
that the master's pain must end.

01:02:25.100 --> 01:02:27.400
And it will end tonight.

01:02:27.500 --> 01:02:31.900
The curse will be broken,
and we can all finally move on.

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:34.700
All right. That's it, man .
Where's my wife?

01:02:34.800 --> 01:02:36.800
Getting ready for her wedding,
of course.

01:02:36.900 --> 01:02:38.200
What wedding?
He can't marry her.

01:02:38.300 --> 01:02:39.600
He's dead, and she's not.

01:02:39.700 --> 01:02:41.100
True.

01:02:41.100 --> 01:02:43.600
But that can be
easily corrected.

01:02:43.600 --> 01:02:47.900
Life, l'm afraid,
is such a delicate state.

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:51.400
lf you put one finger on
my wife, l swear l'll kill you.

01:02:54.400 --> 01:02:58.100
How wonderful.
You're going to kill a ghost.

01:02:58.100 --> 01:03:00.300
-Leave him alone!
-Stop it!

01:03:01.900 --> 01:03:03.600
-Aah!
-Aah!

01:03:03.700 --> 01:03:05.800
Let them go!

01:03:09.400 --> 01:03:12.000
You're gonna let my kids out
of here, take me to my wife,

01:03:12.100 --> 01:03:13.600
and let us out of here
right now!

01:03:13.700 --> 01:03:17.500
You want out, fine.

01:03:17.600 --> 01:03:20.500
Let me show you out.

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:29.100
Now, for the last time,
good night, Mr. Evers.

01:03:30.800 --> 01:03:33.200
Aah!

01:03:33.300 --> 01:03:35.000
Ugh!

01:03:42.400 --> 01:03:44.400
Oh!

01:04:05.400 --> 01:04:07.700
This house has waited so long

01:04:07.800 --> 01:04:11.600
to have its shroud
of darkness lifted.

01:04:11.700 --> 01:04:18.400
And tonight, for the first time
in, oh, so many years,

01:04:18.400 --> 01:04:20.200
l believe it may be possible

01:04:20.300 --> 01:04:24.800
that the story will finally end
differently.

01:04:24.800 --> 01:04:26.500
Sara?

01:04:26.600 --> 01:04:30.000
Do you believe that love
is about second chances?

01:04:30.100 --> 01:04:32.500
About forgiveness?

01:04:32.600 --> 01:04:35.300
Yes, l do.

01:04:35.800 --> 01:04:37.800
Don't you remember?

01:04:37.900 --> 01:04:39.400
Remember?

01:04:39.400 --> 01:04:40.900
Mr. Gracey, are you all right?

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:42.800
Don't you recognize me at all?

01:04:42.900 --> 01:04:44.300
Mr. Gracey.

01:04:44.400 --> 01:04:46.700
l thought certainly bringing you
back to Gracey Manor

01:04:46.800 --> 01:04:48.600
would help you remember.

01:04:48.600 --> 01:04:51.000
Remember what?
Mr. Gracey, you're scaring me.

01:04:51.100 --> 01:04:52.900
Where it happened.

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:55.100
Where we spent
our last moments together.

01:04:55.100 --> 01:04:58.600
Where we danced together
for the last time before you...

01:04:58.600 --> 01:05:01.100
Before you killed yourself!

01:05:01.100 --> 01:05:02.400
But now you've returned to me.

01:05:02.500 --> 01:05:05.200
And at long last,
we can be together.

01:05:05.300 --> 01:05:06.800
Why do you not remember?

01:05:06.900 --> 01:05:08.900
You were my world, my life!

01:05:08.900 --> 01:05:11.600
And l have loved you in death
as l did in life!

01:05:11.700 --> 01:05:13.400
Let me go!

01:05:13.400 --> 01:05:15.600
Why do you not remember?

01:05:17.600 --> 01:05:19.600
You are her.
You are Elizabeth.

01:05:19.700 --> 01:05:20.800
You must be!

01:05:20.900 --> 01:05:22.900
Can you not sense it?
Search your heart.

01:05:22.900 --> 01:05:24.500
l am your one true love.

01:05:24.600 --> 01:05:26.000
And now we can finally
be together.

01:05:26.100 --> 01:05:27.300
Don't you understand?

01:05:27.800 --> 01:05:29.400
Elizabeth ,
you must listen to me.

01:05:29.400 --> 01:05:30.900
l'm not Elizabeth!

01:05:30.900 --> 01:05:32.900
Please!
l implore you.

01:05:32.900 --> 01:05:35.500
Leave me alone!
Get away from me!

01:05:41.300 --> 01:05:44.200
She doesn't remember.

01:05:44.300 --> 01:05:45.700
lt can't be her.

01:05:45.800 --> 01:05:48.100
lt is her, sir.

01:05:48.100 --> 01:05:51.400
The gypsy woman
prophesied her return.

01:05:51.500 --> 01:05:54.400
And now the time has come.

01:05:55.100 --> 01:05:56.600
You had best get ready.

01:05:56.700 --> 01:05:58.600
But she doesn't remember.

01:05:58.700 --> 01:06:01.300
ln time she will , sir.

01:06:01.400 --> 01:06:04.700
l assure you she will.

01:06:09.900 --> 01:06:13.500
Open up!
Hey!

01:06:13.600 --> 01:06:15.500
Let me in !

01:06:28.500 --> 01:06:30.600
Aah!

01:06:47.800 --> 01:06:50.200
Oh , Ramsley,
you have to help me.

01:06:50.300 --> 01:06:53.100
There's something
horribly wrong. Mr. Gracey...

01:06:53.100 --> 01:06:56.100
Yes. l know, my dear.
l know.

01:06:56.100 --> 01:06:57.700
He's expecting you .

01:06:57.800 --> 01:07:01.500
He's always been expecting you.

01:07:01.600 --> 01:07:04.500
And you haven't put on
your dress yet.

01:07:04.600 --> 01:07:07.100
We can't keep
the master waiting.

01:07:07.200 --> 01:07:09.000
Waiting?
For what?

01:07:09.100 --> 01:07:12.400
Why, your wedding, of course.

01:07:12.500 --> 01:07:13.600
My...

01:07:14.200 --> 01:07:16.200
l'm not Elizabeth!

01:07:16.200 --> 01:07:18.000
Of course you are, my dear.

01:07:18.100 --> 01:07:19.600
You may not see it yet.

01:07:19.700 --> 01:07:21.900
But in time you will .

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:25.100
You don't actually think l'm
going through with this madness?

01:07:25.200 --> 01:07:28.600
Oh, yes.
l very much do.

01:07:28.700 --> 01:07:30.400
You see...

01:07:30.500 --> 01:07:33.500
we wouldn't want anything
to happen to the children.

01:07:33.600 --> 01:07:35.500
Now, would we?

01:07:35.600 --> 01:07:37.900
Michael!
Megan!

01:07:37.900 --> 01:07:39.200
You wouldn't.

01:07:39.300 --> 01:07:41.300
Of course not, my dear.

01:07:41.400 --> 01:07:43.500
But that is entirely up to you.

01:07:43.600 --> 01:07:50.100
lf not, l really do fear
for the children.

01:07:53.100 --> 01:07:54.700
Have her ready.

01:07:54.800 --> 01:07:58.400
And this time, any further acts
of insubordination

01:07:58.500 --> 01:08:01.300
will be dealt with
in the harshest possible manner.

01:08:01.400 --> 01:08:03.200
But, sir?

01:08:03.200 --> 01:08:06.500
There are worse things
than purgatory, madam.

01:08:06.600 --> 01:08:09.000
l can assure you.

01:08:12.100 --> 01:08:14.300
Have her ready.

01:08:56.899 --> 01:08:59.899
Tears of joy.

01:09:23.899 --> 01:09:25.800
What are you doing?

01:09:25.899 --> 01:09:28.200
Hey, you leave me alone.

01:09:28.200 --> 01:09:29.899
Just get out of here
and leave me alone.

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:30.700
Oh, l see.

01:09:30.700 --> 01:09:33.700
You're just gonna sit there,
feeling sorry for yourself.

01:09:33.800 --> 01:09:35.600
You tell me why not.

01:09:35.700 --> 01:09:38.200
This whole thing was my fault.

01:09:38.300 --> 01:09:41.100
We should've never been here
in the first place.

01:09:41.200 --> 01:09:42.899
Supposed to be at the lake.

01:09:42.899 --> 01:09:46.700
We'd be sitting by a warm fire
right now.

01:09:46.700 --> 01:09:49.200
And l made us come here.

01:09:49.300 --> 01:09:52.100
And now it's too late.

01:09:52.200 --> 01:09:55.000
No.
lt's never too late.

01:09:55.100 --> 01:09:57.900
Hey, look, l tried to get in
there, and l can't, all right?

01:09:57.900 --> 01:09:59.400
l tried!
l failed!

01:09:59.400 --> 01:10:01.300
You try.
You fail.

01:10:01.400 --> 01:10:03.400
You try.
You fail.

01:10:03.400 --> 01:10:07.100
But the only true failure
is when you stop trying.

01:10:07.200 --> 01:10:10.500
What do you want me to do?
Huh?

01:10:12.200 --> 01:10:14.400
Try again.

01:10:20.700 --> 01:10:21.700
Hold on!

01:10:21.800 --> 01:10:24.000
With what?

01:10:29.900 --> 01:10:32.400
-Aah!
-Aah!

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:37.700
Elizabeth?

01:10:41.400 --> 01:10:44.000
Yes, my love.

01:10:50.800 --> 01:10:51.900
l'll be right back.

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:54.800
Okay.
l'll wait here.

01:10:56.800 --> 01:10:58.300
Dearly beloved,

01:10:58.300 --> 01:11:01.100
we are gathered together here
in the sight of God

01:11:01.200 --> 01:11:04.600
to join this man and this woman
in the bonds of holy matrimony.

01:11:04.700 --> 01:11:07.500
Dad!
Help us!

01:11:09.600 --> 01:11:12.300
Michael!
Megan!

01:11:15.500 --> 01:11:18.000
Wilt thou , Edward Gracey,

01:11:18.100 --> 01:11:20.600
have this woman to be
thy wedded wife,

01:11:20.700 --> 01:11:23.200
to live together
after God's ordinance

01:11:23.300 --> 01:11:25.500
in the holiest state
of matrimony?

01:11:25.500 --> 01:11:26.800
l will.

01:11:30.800 --> 01:11:34.400
And do you, Elizabeth Henshaw,

01:11:34.500 --> 01:11:37.300
take this man to be
your lawful husband,

01:11:37.300 --> 01:11:42.900
to love and cherish in death
as you did in life?

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:43.800
l do.

01:11:44.300 --> 01:11:45.700
Whoa!

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:54.300
Aah!

01:11:54.700 --> 01:11:58.700
From this day forward, you
shall be joined together as one

01:11:58.800 --> 01:12:03.000
for all eternity
until the very end of time.

01:12:10.600 --> 01:12:16.000
What God has joined together
let no man cast asunder.

01:12:19.600 --> 01:12:21.200
-Dad!
-Dad!

01:12:23.500 --> 01:12:26.700
lf anyone has any objections...

01:12:28.700 --> 01:12:31.300
Yeah, l got a few objections!

01:12:37.600 --> 01:12:39.400
The next time l say
we're going to the lake,

01:12:39.500 --> 01:12:41.800
-we're going to the lake.
-Let's go.

01:12:43.200 --> 01:12:44.800
Get away from her.

01:12:44.900 --> 01:12:46.400
l lost her once.

01:12:46.500 --> 01:12:48.700
l don't intend
to let it happen again.

01:12:48.700 --> 01:12:51.300
This is not Elizabeth .
Ramsley, you tell him the truth.

01:12:51.400 --> 01:12:54.400
l don't know
what you're talking about.

01:12:54.500 --> 01:12:55.600
Now you got amnesia, huh?

01:12:55.700 --> 01:12:57.700
Elizabeth didn't kill herself.
He did it.

01:12:57.800 --> 01:12:59.300
He's been lying to you
all along.

01:12:59.400 --> 01:13:01.800
l'm warning you, sir.

01:13:01.900 --> 01:13:03.000
Step away.

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:04.600
Don't think 'cause
you pull out your sword

01:13:04.700 --> 01:13:05.800
l'm gonna let you marry my wife.

01:13:05.900 --> 01:13:08.100
My patience is wearing thin.

01:13:08.100 --> 01:13:10.400
Elizabeth , please, come along.

01:13:10.400 --> 01:13:13.100
l'm not Elizabeth.

01:13:13.200 --> 01:13:14.100
You must be.

01:13:14.200 --> 01:13:16.300
Her name is Sara.
She's from New Jersey.

01:13:16.400 --> 01:13:18.000
Ramsley wants you to think
she's Elizabeth

01:13:18.100 --> 01:13:20.000
so this curse would be lifted.

01:13:20.100 --> 01:13:22.200
That is absurd.

01:13:22.300 --> 01:13:23.900
Forgive me.

01:13:23.900 --> 01:13:25.200
lf you're gonna kill me,
kill me.

01:13:25.300 --> 01:13:26.800
But on the other side,

01:13:26.900 --> 01:13:28.600
l'm gonna be whipping your ass
for all eternity.

01:13:28.700 --> 01:13:31.300
So maybe you should read this
before you stab somebody.

01:13:31.400 --> 01:13:33.500
-What is it?
-lt's Elizabeth's letter.

01:13:33.600 --> 01:13:35.100
Her real letter.
The one she wrote.

01:13:35.200 --> 01:13:37.800
The one he stole.
You never saw it.

01:13:45.800 --> 01:13:48.100
What's the meaning of this?

01:13:48.100 --> 01:13:52.400
Must we continue to listen
to the ramblings of a lunatic?

01:13:52.500 --> 01:13:54.200
But it is written in her hand.

01:13:54.300 --> 01:13:56.700
Yeah, it's written in her hand .
Explain that, Ramsley.

01:13:56.800 --> 01:13:58.600
Well?

01:14:02.900 --> 01:14:05.900
Your union was unacceptable.

01:14:05.900 --> 01:14:10.300
l tried to warn you ,
but you wouldn't listen.

01:14:10.300 --> 01:14:11.900
So you killed her.

01:14:11.900 --> 01:14:15.900
l told you it would be a mistake
to run away with that girl.

01:14:15.900 --> 01:14:19.300
But l loved her!
Was love my mistake?

01:14:19.300 --> 01:14:21.000
Yes!

01:14:21.600 --> 01:14:23.600
l tried to protect you.

01:14:23.600 --> 01:14:27.500
All these years
l've sacrificed for you.

01:14:27.600 --> 01:14:32.200
But what would you understand
of sacrifice, duty, or honor?

01:14:32.300 --> 01:14:34.200
You loved her.

01:14:34.300 --> 01:14:36.100
Well, damn you .

01:14:36.200 --> 01:14:38.700
Damn you all to hell!

01:14:44.100 --> 01:14:46.200
Aah!

01:15:18.400 --> 01:15:20.400
Aah!

01:15:23.200 --> 01:15:24.000
Aah!

01:15:24.100 --> 01:15:26.200
Jim!

01:15:26.200 --> 01:15:27.500
Aah!

01:15:29.500 --> 01:15:31.900
Aah!

01:15:36.900 --> 01:15:38.800
Aah!

01:15:59.500 --> 01:16:01.700
-Mom!
-Mom!

01:16:01.800 --> 01:16:02.800
Mom , what's wrong?

01:16:02.900 --> 01:16:04.000
Are you all right?

01:16:04.100 --> 01:16:05.500
-Mom.
-Hey!

01:16:05.600 --> 01:16:07.900
Hey, Sara.
Sara, what's the matter?

01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:10.100
Sara, what's wrong?

01:16:10.100 --> 01:16:11.700
Hey, what's the matter?
What's wrong?

01:16:11.800 --> 01:16:13.600
lt's the poison!

01:16:13.700 --> 01:16:14.800
Oh, no.

01:16:14.900 --> 01:16:17.000
No.
Hey, Sara.

01:16:17.100 --> 01:16:18.500
Come on. Please.
Don't do this!

01:16:18.600 --> 01:16:20.000
Sara, don't do this.
Please.

01:16:20.100 --> 01:16:21.800
Jim...

01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:25.300
Sara! Hey!

01:16:25.300 --> 01:16:27.600
Sara.
Sara, come on. Please.

01:16:27.600 --> 01:16:29.100
Sara.

01:16:29.200 --> 01:16:31.000
Sara, l love you.

01:16:31.100 --> 01:16:34.000
Sara, please.
l love you so much.

01:16:41.100 --> 01:16:43.000
Hey, get away from us!
Leave us alone!

01:16:43.100 --> 01:16:44.200
No, Dad.

01:16:44.300 --> 01:16:46.200
lt won't hurt us.

01:17:54.800 --> 01:17:57.300
Elizabeth, is that you?

01:17:57.400 --> 01:17:59.800
Yes, my love.

01:17:59.900 --> 01:18:02.800
The ghost ball was Elizabeth.

01:18:02.900 --> 01:18:06.300
The truth had to be known
for me to be released.

01:18:06.400 --> 01:18:08.900
He saved me.

01:18:10.700 --> 01:18:13.200
lt was nothing.

01:18:13.200 --> 01:18:15.800
Oh, Elizabeth.

01:18:15.800 --> 01:18:18.000
Yes, my darling?

01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:23.100
l have waited so long
for this moment.

01:18:23.200 --> 01:18:26.300
And now only heaven awaits.

01:18:37.400 --> 01:18:40.100
He's not really kissing
your mom .

01:18:44.400 --> 01:18:45.900
Hey.

01:18:47.200 --> 01:18:49.100
That's my wife.

01:18:57.800 --> 01:18:59.200
Sara?

01:19:06.200 --> 01:19:07.700
Jim?

01:19:07.800 --> 01:19:09.600
l thought l lost you.

01:19:09.600 --> 01:19:11.200
Oh.

01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:14.300
l thought l lost you, too.

01:19:15.300 --> 01:19:17.200
l'm back, Sara.

01:19:17.200 --> 01:19:19.000
l'm back.

01:19:21.700 --> 01:19:23.200
Can you ever forgive me?

01:19:23.200 --> 01:19:27.100
Oh, what's to forgive?
You loved her.

01:19:27.200 --> 01:19:29.700
Here.
Take this.

01:19:30.700 --> 01:19:31.700
What is it?

01:19:31.700 --> 01:19:34.600
The deed to the house.
lt's yours.

01:19:34.700 --> 01:19:36.500
Do with it what you will.

01:19:36.600 --> 01:19:38.500
Sell it, keep it.

01:19:38.600 --> 01:19:42.000
Do whatever makes you
and your family happy.

01:19:47.900 --> 01:19:49.800
And thank you.

01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:54.000
Thank you all so much.

01:20:03.700 --> 01:20:05.600
Wait! Wait for us!

01:20:05.700 --> 01:20:08.200
Hold on!

01:20:08.300 --> 01:20:09.500
What's all this?

01:20:09.600 --> 01:20:11.100
Well , l don't know
what we'll need.

01:20:11.200 --> 01:20:13.300
What are you talking about?
We're going to heaven.

01:20:13.400 --> 01:20:14.600
You can't take it with you.

01:20:14.700 --> 01:20:17.100
The hell l can't.

01:20:17.100 --> 01:20:18.100
-Oh.
-Goodbye.

01:20:18.200 --> 01:20:19.600
-Bye-bye.
-Thank you all so much.

01:20:19.600 --> 01:20:20.600
You're welcome.

01:20:20.600 --> 01:20:22.900
-Thank you.
-So long , now.

01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:25.200
Okay, little man.
All right. Hurry!

01:20:25.300 --> 01:20:26.800
Let's go!

01:20:26.900 --> 01:20:27.600
-Bye!
-Bye!

01:20:27.600 --> 01:20:30.100
Okay.
Here we go.

01:20:35.500 --> 01:20:37.000
Bye-bye.

01:20:58.100 --> 01:21:01.100
Angels in heaven
together at last.

01:21:01.200 --> 01:21:04.500
The tale is well ended
for those who have passed.

01:21:04.600 --> 01:21:08.400
Love endures all ,
no reason , no rhyme.

01:21:08.400 --> 01:21:12.400
lt lasts forever
and forever all time.

01:21:12.400 --> 01:21:13.800
Mom, Leota won't shut up.

01:21:13.900 --> 01:21:16.000
-Are we there yet?
-l'm getting pretty hungry.

01:21:16.100 --> 01:21:17.200
Can we get some pizza?

01:21:17.300 --> 01:21:18.700
How long
before we get there, Sara?

01:21:18.800 --> 01:21:20.200
20 minutes tops.

01:21:20.200 --> 01:21:21.700
Nothing takes 20 minutes.
