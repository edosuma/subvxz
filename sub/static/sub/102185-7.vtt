00:09.226 --> 00:11.228
I didn't think you'd be out
of bed already.

00:11.272 --> 00:15.363
- Yeah, there was a car fire
on Route 220.

00:15.406 --> 00:18.670
And I thought I'd bring home
some breakfast,

00:18.714 --> 00:22.674
but this looks a lot better.

00:22.718 --> 00:24.285
Is that blueberry compote?

00:24.328 --> 00:26.069
- Freshly mashed,

00:26.113 --> 00:28.985
and paired with a savory bacon
and baked egg danish.

00:29.029 --> 00:31.335
- The Speed Force.

00:31.379 --> 00:33.903
- Are you okay, Barry?
You're not still feeling

00:33.946 --> 00:35.600
the effects of Psych's attack,
are you?

00:35.644 --> 00:36.993
- Nah, I'm good.
I just--

00:37.037 --> 00:39.822
I had no idea
that you could cook.

00:39.865 --> 00:42.216
- Bobby Flay has got
nothing on Nora.

00:42.259 --> 00:44.392
- You know, it's funny,

00:44.435 --> 00:46.220
cooking is the process of
combining ingredients

00:46.263 --> 00:48.091
with heat to create
molecular change,

00:48.135 --> 00:50.006
but this feels like
so much more.

00:50.050 --> 00:53.488
- Huh.
- Mimosa?

00:53.531 --> 00:55.098
- Sure.

01:29.176 --> 01:31.047

all the satellites

01:31.091 --> 01:33.267
scanning for the new forces.

01:33.310 --> 01:35.660

Strength Force,

01:35.704 --> 01:36.661
and now the Still Force.

01:36.705 --> 01:38.272
- Yeah, uh, so far,

01:38.315 --> 01:41.144
no hits on any of
their isotropic signatures.

01:41.188 --> 01:43.015
- Well, it's still good
that you're here with us.

01:43.059 --> 01:44.582
The last time the Forces
attacked you,

01:44.626 --> 01:45.844
you almost died.

anyone.

01:47.281 --> 01:49.544

You know, in a weird way,

01:49.587 --> 01:51.763
it's like you've been a part of
this family all along.

01:54.462 --> 01:56.333
Are you okay?

01:56.377 --> 01:57.769

01:57.813 --> 01:58.944
a little worried
about the fact that

01:58.988 --> 02:00.381
my powers are glitching again,

02:00.424 --> 02:02.818
especially since
I just got them back.

02:02.861 --> 02:04.167
- Okay, well,
we can call Caitlin

02:04.211 --> 02:05.777
and have her run
some more tests.

02:05.821 --> 02:07.127
How do you feel now?

02:07.170 --> 02:08.171
- I feel fine, I just--

02:08.215 --> 02:09.651
I don't know what happened.

02:09.694 --> 02:12.480
- Actually, I think
I'm the reason.

02:12.523 --> 02:14.090
Since I'm here now,

02:14.134 --> 02:16.136
I'm increasing your abilities
as best I can.

02:16.179 --> 02:17.789
It may take
some getting used to,

02:17.833 --> 02:21.097
but you'll need it
if the other Forces come back.

02:23.795 --> 02:25.623
- Uh, that's work.

02:25.667 --> 02:28.235
I gotta go.
- I should come with you.

02:28.278 --> 02:30.628
- Oh?
- I'm like your battery now.

02:30.672 --> 02:33.414
If Fuerza and Psych are back--
- Yeah, no, I don't--

02:33.457 --> 02:36.939
having you at a crime scene
might not be a great idea.

02:36.982 --> 02:38.201
- You've already been
hurt once.

02:38.245 --> 02:39.985
I can help boost your speed.

02:40.029 --> 02:42.118
- I know, I know, it just--
it might just be, like,

02:42.162 --> 02:43.424
a traffic accident
or something,

02:43.467 --> 02:45.730
so, um, just let me find out.

02:45.774 --> 02:47.863
- Of course, but don't worry.

02:47.906 --> 02:50.126
If you need me, I'll sense it,

02:50.170 --> 02:52.998
and I'll be there
in a heartbeat.

02:53.042 --> 02:54.826
- Great.

02:54.870 --> 02:56.611
- Okay.

02:56.654 --> 02:57.829
- Um, so I'm gonna go.

02:57.873 --> 03:00.789
- Okay.
- Okay.

03:00.832 --> 03:04.009
-
I hope he's okay.

03:08.318 --> 03:10.712
- One count
of aggravated assault...

03:13.149 --> 03:16.108
One count
of attempted murder...

03:17.719 --> 03:19.808
Two counts of kidnapping.

03:23.072 --> 03:26.162
It's a good thing you never
lived up to your original name.

03:26.206 --> 03:28.991
- I thought once you started
helping people,

03:29.034 --> 03:31.689
CCPD dropped the investigation.

03:31.733 --> 03:34.039
- Yeah, they did,
they did, but...

03:34.083 --> 03:36.346
the State never officially
dropped its charges,

03:36.390 --> 03:38.261
which means Kristin Kramer
has everything

03:38.305 --> 03:39.915
that she needs to put you
in Iron Heights.

03:39.958 --> 03:41.917
- I'm gonna find Kramer,
and I'm gonna kick her ass.

03:41.960 --> 03:44.441
- No, no, you're not.

03:44.485 --> 03:46.138
Kramer is former
Army Intelligence.

03:46.182 --> 03:48.924
Wherever she goes, heads roll.
Just--

03:48.967 --> 03:50.752
- Look, I'm not some thug
anymore, okay?

03:50.795 --> 03:53.276
I've grown.
- I know that, honey, I do.

03:53.320 --> 03:56.323
Look, I'm one of the people
that you kidnapped.

03:56.366 --> 03:58.629
My advice to you,
as your attorney,

03:58.673 --> 04:00.327
is to lay low.

04:00.370 --> 04:01.937
- Wait, so--

04:01.980 --> 04:03.895
Frost can't do superhero stuff
anymore?

04:03.939 --> 04:05.767
- Nope, not out in the field.

04:05.810 --> 04:07.421
Look, Frost, you're an artist,
okay?

04:07.464 --> 04:09.205
Just take some time off,

04:09.249 --> 04:11.338
chase those canvasses,
create...

04:11.381 --> 04:13.427
just do it all here at S.T.A.R.
Labs, where you're safe.

04:13.470 --> 04:14.993
- I just got a life,

04:15.037 --> 04:16.343
and now you're telling me
I can't live it.

04:16.386 --> 04:18.649
- For a little while, yeah.

04:18.693 --> 04:21.086
Look, Kramer is appointed
by the governor, right?

04:21.130 --> 04:22.523
She doesn't get results,

04:22.566 --> 04:25.221
she's gonna
get reassigned.

04:25.265 --> 04:28.311
- Frost,
I know this isn't fair,

04:28.355 --> 04:32.184
but it's our best option
right now.

04:32.228 --> 04:35.231
- Fine, I'll quarantine here.

04:35.275 --> 04:37.929
- Blazing Bessie Blount,

04:37.973 --> 04:40.584
I just got my first solo
crime scene call.

04:42.282 --> 04:44.545
Oh, since Cisco and Kamilla
are away and all,

04:44.588 --> 04:47.983
I'm the only CCPD tech
consultant around.

04:48.026 --> 04:49.201
I wonder what it is.

04:49.245 --> 04:50.899
Maybe it's a 1090.

04:50.942 --> 04:54.076
Maybe it's a 1011.

04:54.119 --> 04:57.862
Oh, snap, it's a 1035.

04:57.906 --> 04:59.386
Frost, I am so sorry but--

04:59.429 --> 05:00.517
- It's fine.

05:00.561 --> 05:03.041
Go have your fun, Peralta.

05:08.612 --> 05:10.397
- Thank you, thank you,

05:10.440 --> 05:13.269
sorry, thank you.

05:13.313 --> 05:16.141
Holy Baby Grogu,

05:16.185 --> 05:17.795
what happened here?

05:17.839 --> 05:20.058
- This delivery van
was full of tech,

05:20.102 --> 05:23.148
and was hit by a perp
in an ice attack.

05:23.192 --> 05:26.064
Apparently some experimental
microchip was stolen.

05:26.108 --> 05:29.285
- Huh, that doesn't
sound so bad.

05:29.329 --> 05:31.113
What's all that?

05:31.156 --> 05:32.114
- The driver.

05:35.247 --> 05:38.990
- Officers.

05:39.034 --> 05:40.992
Looks like Killer Frost
has been busy.

05:50.959 --> 05:52.917
- I know how this looks.

05:52.961 --> 05:56.921
But there are other criminals
that use ice to commit crimes,

05:56.965 --> 05:58.270
like Leonard Snart.

05:58.314 --> 06:00.490
- Snart was a man with a gun.

06:00.534 --> 06:04.886
Mr. Runk, you're our new
technical consultant

06:04.929 --> 06:07.715

these ice crystals here?

06:33.131 --> 06:35.873
They're dendrictic,
like tree branches.

06:35.917 --> 06:39.355
Frost's ice crystals are
usually hexagonal.

06:39.399 --> 06:42.140

Officer Allen.

06:42.184 --> 06:44.404
And you seem to know
a lot about her powers.

06:44.447 --> 06:46.449

her crime scenes,

06:46.493 --> 06:49.583

06:49.626 --> 06:51.846
- Until now, apparently.

06:51.889 --> 06:54.501
- Officer Allen is

our department's
top forensics examiner, ma'am.

06:57.634 --> 06:58.766
If there's any evidence here

06:58.809 --> 07:00.594

he will find it.

07:00.637 --> 07:02.378

07:02.422 --> 07:04.249
Captain, I hate to pull rank,

07:04.293 --> 07:06.730

07:08.471 --> 07:10.342
long-standing
metahuman problems.

07:10.386 --> 07:12.606

public safety in mind.

07:12.649 --> 07:14.608

- Good.

07:14.651 --> 07:16.218
Because I'm going
to ask the DA's office

07:16.261 --> 07:18.568

for Killer Frost's arrest.

07:18.612 --> 07:21.789

07:37.544 --> 07:40.329
"Yes, Frost did spend
the evening with Caitlin."

07:40.372 --> 07:43.245

her alibi without admitting

to a fugitive.
