00:01.022 --> 00:03.391
- <i>Previously on "Quantico"...</i>
- Male instructor: Welcome to The Farm.

00:03.415 --> 00:04.437
Brace yourselves.

00:04.462 --> 00:05.493
Well, we're getting a
handler, aren't we?

00:05.517 --> 00:07.695
<i>Handlers</i>... You will each have one.

00:07.720 --> 00:10.117
"We are the Citizen's Liberation Front.

00:10.142 --> 00:11.949
Any attempt to cross our perimeter

00:11.954 --> 00:15.085
will result in the release
of a biological agent."

00:15.090 --> 00:17.457
- You know that woman?
- I know some of the others, too.

00:17.482 --> 00:18.747
We trained together at The Farm.

00:18.771 --> 00:20.457
Raina: In order to identify a terrorist,

00:20.462 --> 00:22.993
when they return as a hostage,
we need to mark them.

00:22.998 --> 00:25.596
Miranda, I'm in an NYPD emergency bunker.

00:25.601 --> 00:27.297
I'm gonna look around and
see what I can find, okay?

00:27.302 --> 00:28.769
I'll call you back.

00:32.371 --> 00:35.527
_

00:36.684 --> 00:38.738
_

00:39.815 --> 00:41.022
Sorry.

00:43.151 --> 00:45.349
Why didn't they kill me?
They knew what I was doing.

00:45.354 --> 00:47.417
They need you to translate.

00:47.422 --> 00:49.419
I'm worried they need
me for something else.

00:49.424 --> 00:51.788
If we could just find a way to
see under one person's mask,

00:51.793 --> 00:54.024
we could figure out who they are
and how they know each other,

00:54.029 --> 00:55.626
what they want.

00:55.631 --> 00:59.162
Maybe if you ask nicely,
one of them will take off their mask.

00:59.167 --> 01:01.098
Actually, that's not far off
from what I was thinking.

01:01.103 --> 01:03.600
I just hope Alex is inside the perimeter.

01:03.605 --> 01:05.468
All right, let's go
over this one more time.

01:05.474 --> 01:08.805
You need entrances, exits,
number of terrorists, hostages,

01:08.810 --> 01:12.209
explosives, how they're rigged,
armaments, hostage locations,

01:12.214 --> 01:17.381
and if bio weapons are a
real threat or a bluff.

01:17.386 --> 01:18.815
Anything I'm forgetting?

01:18.820 --> 01:21.351
Alex, please be careful.

01:21.356 --> 01:22.152
<i>Okay.</i>

01:22.157 --> 01:24.058
I will.

01:27.696 --> 01:28.662
[Telephone beeps]

01:30.118 --> 01:31.482
_

01:39.207 --> 01:42.172
Okay, Alex, give me the lay of the land.

01:42.177 --> 01:43.674
Well, it's only been a week,

01:43.679 --> 01:46.209
but all the recruits are still an enigma.

01:46.214 --> 01:48.145
You must have gained some intel.

01:48.150 --> 01:49.880
These people are training to be spies.

01:49.885 --> 01:51.548
Think they don't know what they're doing?

01:51.553 --> 01:53.574
Okay, well, what have
you learned about them

01:53.599 --> 01:54.751
in the past week?

01:54.756 --> 01:56.653
The lawyer, Dayana.

01:56.658 --> 01:58.817
Last week, she was falling apart.

01:58.842 --> 02:00.824
This week, she's insanely driven.

02:00.829 --> 02:06.763
[Sighs] You know, there's better
ways to cure insomnia.

02:06.768 --> 02:07.664
I've slept.

02:07.669 --> 02:09.933
I'm just doing some required reading.

02:09.937 --> 02:11.568
You haven't done that yet?
It's Monday already.

02:11.573 --> 02:14.137
This is next week's.

02:14.162 --> 02:16.740
Alex: If she was recruited by the AIC...

02:16.745 --> 02:18.041
The AIC?

02:18.046 --> 02:19.988
It's CIA in reverse.

02:20.013 --> 02:21.712
Ryan came up with the name.

02:21.717 --> 02:22.536
I thought it was cute.

02:22.560 --> 02:25.616
Cute? You gave a group of
deadly insurgents a nickname.

02:25.621 --> 02:27.784
It's better than "rogue faction."

02:27.789 --> 02:32.289
Okay, so if this AIC has
tapped Dayana already,

02:32.294 --> 02:34.091
she would be a good fit because?

02:34.096 --> 02:37.127
I'm not sure. All I know is she's
the weakest link so far.

02:37.132 --> 02:39.196
Ryan: A supposed power player
who cries herself to sleep

02:39.201 --> 02:40.197
when no one's looking?

02:40.202 --> 02:43.519
Then again, damsel
in emotional distress is...

02:44.806 --> 02:46.269
that's a good cover.

02:46.274 --> 02:48.038
What about LeÃ³n Valez?

02:48.043 --> 02:51.141
He doesn't say much, but
he sees everything.

02:51.146 --> 02:53.410
He's always watching.

02:53.415 --> 02:55.779
He'd be my first choice
if it weren't so obvious.

02:55.784 --> 02:57.481
I have yet to see what his skills are

02:57.486 --> 02:58.615
outside of the pool table.

02:58.620 --> 03:03.120
- What does he know about you?
- More than he should.

03:03.125 --> 03:04.821
Did you say there's a new recruit?

03:04.826 --> 03:06.990
[Scoffs] Leigh Davis.

03:06.995 --> 03:08.925
She appeared out of nowhere two days ago.

03:08.930 --> 03:11.261
Mother of two from Pacific Palisades.

03:11.266 --> 03:13.296
Reminds me of you, actually.

03:13.301 --> 03:14.998
Elegant, refined.

03:15.003 --> 03:17.000
Totally out of place and high strung.

03:17.005 --> 03:18.235
Runs her own business.

03:18.240 --> 03:19.803
She's a wedding planner.

03:19.808 --> 03:21.772
She prefers "event coordinator."

03:21.777 --> 03:24.975
She prefers... a lot of things.

03:24.980 --> 03:27.611
Art Basel submission?

03:27.616 --> 03:28.912
Oh, no, this is my schedule.

03:28.917 --> 03:30.347
It's how I achieve peak productivity.

03:30.352 --> 03:31.748
Every Post-it is a quarter hour.

03:31.753 --> 03:32.983
Every quarter hour is accounted for.

03:32.988 --> 03:35.285
Every dot is an idea. Every check
mark is an accomplishment.

03:35.290 --> 03:36.920
If you want, I can do the same for you.

03:36.945 --> 03:38.041
Uh, no, thanks.

03:38.066 --> 03:40.042
I prefer to play things by ear.

03:40.067 --> 03:41.858
But if you have any Adderall left over...

03:41.863 --> 03:43.813
- And Harry Doyle?
- The Kingsman?

03:43.838 --> 03:45.142
Well, I wouldn't play cards with the guy,

03:45.166 --> 03:46.229
if that's what you're asking.

03:46.234 --> 03:47.922
There's something I
really like about him.

03:47.947 --> 03:50.367
I mean, if I didn't think he
was a cold-blooded traitor,

03:50.372 --> 03:51.572
we could be friends.

03:53.775 --> 03:54.909
- Nice.
- That's my shirt.

03:54.934 --> 03:57.515
_

03:57.879 --> 04:00.610
- And Sebastian Chen?
- The priest?

04:00.615 --> 04:02.379
Really with the nicknames?

04:02.404 --> 04:03.933
Okay, this one's actually true,

04:03.958 --> 04:06.763
'cause before he was recruited,
he was in the seminary.

04:06.788 --> 04:09.352
I keep trying, but...

04:09.357 --> 04:10.987
Ryan: He's impenetrable.

04:10.992 --> 04:12.456
A fortress.

04:12.461 --> 04:14.991
Obviously, that makes
me want to know more.

04:14.996 --> 04:16.644
Okay, so what about recruitment?

04:16.670 --> 04:18.894
We still don't know if these
people were already tapped,

04:18.899 --> 04:20.363
or if it's happening as we speak.

04:20.368 --> 04:22.566
Do you think that Owen Hall's daughter

04:22.571 --> 04:24.559
might be recruiting people with him?

04:24.584 --> 04:25.621
[Woman speaking Arabic]

04:25.646 --> 04:27.535
Lydia's intense.

04:27.834 --> 04:29.831
I have no idea what makes her tick,

04:29.836 --> 04:34.202
but if she's recruiting,
they'd have a hard time saying no.

04:34.207 --> 04:36.775
[Volume increases]

04:38.311 --> 04:39.941

04:39.946 --> 04:41.609
Call me back.

04:41.634 --> 04:43.749
Look [Sighs] I don't know how

04:43.754 --> 04:45.221
we're supposed to make any headway.

04:45.246 --> 04:49.373
The line between operative
and anarchist is razor thin.

04:49.398 --> 04:52.053
How would you like to better
be able to tell the difference?

04:52.058 --> 04:52.887
I'm listening.

04:52.892 --> 04:55.022
Not yet, but you will be.

04:55.027 --> 04:57.892
- It's a highly sensitive bug.
- But there's only one.

04:57.897 --> 04:59.360
One bug between the two of you.

04:59.365 --> 05:01.295
The Farm is too far out
of range from here

05:01.300 --> 05:03.865
for us to put any more of these
in proximity to each other.

05:03.870 --> 05:05.299
Another bug close to this

05:05.304 --> 05:08.069
would create interference
and give you away.

05:08.074 --> 05:09.537
So, what are we supposed to do?

05:09.562 --> 05:11.550
Choose the best
candidate to listen in on.

05:11.555 --> 05:13.040
Ryan: That's gonna take some time.

05:13.045 --> 05:15.414
The Farm is swept for
counter surveillance

05:15.439 --> 05:16.531
every five days.

05:16.556 --> 05:18.312
Our intel says that was yesterday.

05:18.317 --> 05:20.014
This is your window.

05:20.019 --> 05:22.049
You have to be careful if these people

05:22.054 --> 05:24.085
are as dangerous as we think they are.

05:24.090 --> 05:27.579
Great, so if you find us
dead in a double suicide,

05:27.604 --> 05:30.188
please assume that the last
person that we spoke to

05:30.213 --> 05:31.692
was in the AIC.

05:31.697 --> 05:34.562
No one's gonna die if
you make a smart choice.

05:34.567 --> 05:36.164
Don't just go by intuition.

05:36.169 --> 05:39.534
Get people to open up,
see who they really are.

05:39.539 --> 05:42.336
Elicitation?

05:42.341 --> 05:44.005
Well, the CIA's already taught us

05:44.010 --> 05:46.178
the best tool to accomplish that.

05:48.581 --> 05:50.912
Here's to that sweet government salary.

05:50.917 --> 05:53.948
Ah! And a life of sanctioned crime.

05:53.953 --> 05:55.917

- Cheers.

05:55.922 --> 05:57.051
So, if you think about it,

05:57.056 --> 05:58.853
if we all died right now,

05:58.858 --> 06:02.256
not even our family would know how or why

06:02.261 --> 06:03.674
or that we even worked here.

06:03.699 --> 06:05.560
We'd just be some random
star on the wall,

06:05.565 --> 06:08.029
and our stories will never be told.

06:08.034 --> 06:09.864
If you're not gonna muddle the sugar,

06:09.869 --> 06:12.533
what's the point of
making an Old Fashioned?

06:12.538 --> 06:14.339
What do you guys think Leigh's story is?

06:14.364 --> 06:16.971
Besides organizing four out
of five Kardashian weddings?

06:16.976 --> 06:18.039
What? Really?

06:18.044 --> 06:19.040
Yeah, what?

06:19.045 --> 06:20.575
I looked her up.

06:20.580 --> 06:22.109
Didn't you guys do that?

06:22.114 --> 06:23.177
When we're done here,

06:23.182 --> 06:25.147
I just hope wherever they
send me, she's not there.

06:25.171 --> 06:27.148
She sewed a patch on
to my favorite jeans

06:27.153 --> 06:29.183
while I was in the shower
without even asking.

06:29.188 --> 06:30.117
[Laughs]

06:30.122 --> 06:31.664
Don't worry. I read that most operatives

06:31.688 --> 06:33.287
never run into their
classmates once they get out.

06:33.292 --> 06:35.456
That's true. They send you
to the far-flung corners,

06:35.461 --> 06:37.525
wherever you fit in best, they said.

06:37.530 --> 06:39.260
Afghanistan for you, I'm guessing?

06:39.265 --> 06:41.529
Mm. I thought you'd say Alabama.

06:41.534 --> 06:43.798
Well, until I get rid of my accent,

06:43.803 --> 06:45.384
it's South America for me.

06:45.409 --> 06:47.639
You think they'll welcome
you back with open arms?

06:49.608 --> 06:51.138
Owen: Let me ask you something personal.

06:51.143 --> 06:55.309
Where did you last have sex?

06:55.314 --> 06:57.812
I think you might be
asking the wrong person.

06:57.817 --> 06:59.680
Okay, then you answer, Mr. Doyle.

06:59.685 --> 07:01.561
Well, I don't know where he last had sex,

07:01.586 --> 07:03.384
but I last had sex in a car.

07:03.389 --> 07:04.518
Mm. What kind of car?

07:04.523 --> 07:06.387
A Fit, of all things.

07:06.392 --> 07:08.689
Not a very apropos name, if you ask me.

07:08.694 --> 07:10.024
[Laughter]

07:10.029 --> 07:11.225
And where was it parked?

07:11.230 --> 07:13.694
How many cars were around you?

07:13.699 --> 07:15.062
Was anyone in those cars?

07:15.067 --> 07:16.797
Any security cameras?

07:16.802 --> 07:18.032
Did anyone see you leave?

07:18.037 --> 07:20.201
All right, if this is gonna end
with some surveillance video,

07:20.206 --> 07:23.204
I should warn you all now it
gets as NSFW as it can be.

07:23.209 --> 07:26.607
Lydia: The only surveillance that
should've transpired is your own.

07:26.612 --> 07:29.643
As an operative, you'll learn
that God is in the details.

07:29.648 --> 07:32.346
You need to be constantly
aware of your surroundings.

07:32.351 --> 07:33.748
It's called assessment.

07:33.753 --> 07:36.086
An operative has to be
able to walk into a space

07:36.111 --> 07:40.187
and see everything, every angle,
possible threat, escape,

07:40.192 --> 07:43.190
or camera, no matter
what you're involved in.

07:43.195 --> 07:44.925
And you need to be able
to do it in seconds.

07:44.930 --> 07:46.594
I know it seems like an impossible task..

07:46.599 --> 07:51.265
but by the time you're done
here, it will be instinct.

07:51.270 --> 07:53.167
Look at today's itinerary.

07:53.172 --> 07:56.704
Be ready to leave in five minutes.

[Indistinct chatter]

08:03.449 --> 08:05.946
One day, one bug, one shot.

08:05.951 --> 08:07.886
Let the assessment begin.

08:09.455 --> 08:11.352

122, over 1,600 still
locked in at Federal Plaza.

08:19.431 --> 08:22.363
Miranda, I didn't want to
say this in front of everyone

08:22.368 --> 08:27.067
because I know it's crazy, but what if...

08:27.072 --> 08:30.437
The group Alex and Ryan were
investigating is behind this?

08:30.442 --> 08:33.039
It's not crazy at all.
It's my working assumption.

08:33.044 --> 08:36.443
But the operation to uncover
the AIC was a failure.

08:36.448 --> 08:39.246
No one would believe us,
even if we told them.

08:39.251 --> 08:41.148
What if we had something
to convince them?

08:41.153 --> 08:43.150
Six months ago, after
you shut down the op,

08:43.155 --> 08:44.485
I wrote a report.

08:44.490 --> 08:45.981
- Shelby.
- A white paper.

08:46.006 --> 08:47.488
I know, I know. I shouldn't have done it,

08:47.493 --> 08:50.090
but I couldn't just sit
on all the work we did.

08:50.095 --> 08:52.059
Everything we risked
couldn't be for nothing.

08:52.064 --> 08:54.395
Eventually, someone was
gonna need to know

08:54.400 --> 08:55.763

of who these people are

No, I didn't, because you're not.

I picked you because
you're their friends,

you're all business,

19:46.947 --> 19:49.111
you constructed wherein
you barely know each other.

19:49.116 --> 19:51.146
I've seen photographs of you two together

19:51.151 --> 19:52.581
and all your "Super Friends."

19:52.586 --> 19:54.316
You still meet up, huh?

19:54.321 --> 19:55.985
Still talk?

19:55.990 --> 19:59.922
The occasional dinner party,
group text, karaoke Thursdays?

19:59.927 --> 20:01.123
What about that southern she...

20:01.128 --> 20:02.424
Shh! Shh! Quiet.

20:02.429 --> 20:04.426
And that agent who
helped build the bomb...

20:04.431 --> 20:05.561
The cute one, the one who didn't die.

20:05.566 --> 20:07.329
Where did he go?

20:07.334 --> 20:08.230
Will Olsen?

20:08.235 --> 20:09.965
I have no idea.

20:09.970 --> 20:12.234
And those people gave their
lives so that others could live,

20:12.239 --> 20:13.402
so show some respect.

20:13.407 --> 20:15.070
All right, sorry. Yes.

20:15.075 --> 20:17.606
You want to tell me why you're
asking so many damn questions?

20:17.611 --> 20:19.241
Can't I just be interested?

20:19.246 --> 20:21.076
You?

20:21.081 --> 20:23.846
[British accent] Can't.

20:23.851 --> 20:25.247
[Normal accent] There's Dayana.

20:25.252 --> 20:26.582
I'm gonna go see what she knows.

20:26.587 --> 20:28.183
Okay. Sounds like a plan.

20:28.188 --> 20:31.120
You know what?
You strike me as the kind of guy

20:31.125 --> 20:33.088
that works better on his own.

20:33.093 --> 20:36.062
You're boring, you know that?

20:40.634 --> 20:42.431
Here.

20:42.436 --> 20:43.832
[Groans] This is perfect.

20:43.837 --> 20:47.002
For what? Your Bear Grylls impersonation?

20:47.007 --> 20:48.500
Okay, you know I could help you

20:48.525 --> 20:49.972
if you just tell me what we're doing?

20:49.977 --> 20:53.876
Well, we're making a compass.

20:53.881 --> 20:57.780
Get a stick, pound it into the ground,

20:57.785 --> 21:00.282
and wait for the direction
of the sun to change.

21:00.287 --> 21:02.818
Based on the shadow,
we'll know which way is east,

21:02.823 --> 21:04.887
which means we'll know which way to go.

21:04.892 --> 21:07.489
The Farm is on the water.

21:07.494 --> 21:09.291
Nice.

21:09.296 --> 21:11.393
You must have learned a lot of this stuff

21:11.398 --> 21:12.995
being a photojournalist, huh?

21:13.000 --> 21:17.299
Always in far-flung locations,
having to improvise.

21:17.304 --> 21:19.702
Where exactly did you use this last?

21:19.707 --> 21:21.704
Why are you so interested?

21:21.709 --> 21:23.839
Well, I figured we're gonna be together

21:23.844 --> 21:26.508
for the next six months,
and I don't know for how long

21:26.513 --> 21:27.910
trying to get out of here.

21:27.915 --> 21:30.345
[Sighs]

21:30.350 --> 21:32.147
My father taught me.

21:32.152 --> 21:34.416
He took me camping every
summer in Big Bend.

21:34.421 --> 21:37.052
He loved the outdoors.

21:37.057 --> 21:38.858
Mine did, too.

21:41.428 --> 21:44.660
You sure you're not lost?

21:44.665 --> 21:45.940
You seem lost.

21:45.965 --> 21:48.163
I'm not lost. I'm following the tire...

21:48.168 --> 21:52.234
tracks that were clearly
covered on the way out.

21:52.239 --> 21:53.769
He was right.

21:53.774 --> 21:55.337
I learned a little land nav in basic.

21:55.342 --> 21:59.341
I'm a bit rusty, but I think
I can get us out of here.

21:59.346 --> 22:01.677
I don't need help.

22:01.682 --> 22:02.845
Well, don't take this the wrong way,

22:02.850 --> 22:07.416
but you don't really strike me
as the, uh, outdoorsy type.

22:07.421 --> 22:08.717
You know what?

22:08.722 --> 22:09.918
I'm not.

22:09.923 --> 22:13.222
And, yes, on top of it all, I am lost.

22:13.227 --> 22:14.757
<i>We're</i> lost.

22:14.762 --> 22:17.893
You're not my partner,
and I don't want your help.

22:17.898 --> 22:19.628
I'm going to figure this out on my own,

22:19.633 --> 22:24.399
even if it means I must
get over being afraid

22:24.404 --> 22:26.869
of heights and...

22:26.874 --> 22:30.472
climb a tree like freakin' Tarzan.

22:30.477 --> 22:32.241
Then fine.

22:32.246 --> 22:34.243
So...

22:34.248 --> 22:36.382
[Sighs]

22:38.218 --> 22:39.281
What are you doing?

22:39.286 --> 22:41.316
Following you.

22:41.321 --> 22:43.118
I know how resourceful you are.

22:43.123 --> 22:45.821
You found a way to get LeÃ³n
to talk about his prison time.

22:45.826 --> 22:47.062
Hell, I live with the guy,

22:47.087 --> 22:48.490
and the most I get out of him is a grunt.

22:48.495 --> 22:52.427
You and Alex, you talk a lot, yeah?

22:52.432 --> 22:54.396
I saw her with LeÃ³n earlier.

22:54.401 --> 22:56.098
Asked her if she got anywhere.

22:56.103 --> 22:58.000
She said no.

22:58.005 --> 22:59.602
But you...

23:01.241 --> 23:03.739
What are you interested in?

23:03.744 --> 23:06.612
What he had to say,
or that he said it to me?

23:08.582 --> 23:09.945
I'm a lawyer.

23:09.950 --> 23:11.446
I know when I'm being led somewhere.

23:11.451 --> 23:14.750
While you pretend to be lost and helpless

23:14.755 --> 23:16.451
when someone's around,

23:16.456 --> 23:18.520
you know enough to follow tire tracks.

23:18.525 --> 23:21.156
You worked your way through that
bar today with perfect recall.

23:21.161 --> 23:24.259
And you know your way around a backstop.

23:24.264 --> 23:25.460
Now, you may be a lawyer,

23:25.465 --> 23:26.695
but you never said at which firm.

23:26.700 --> 23:31.834
And I'm gonna go out on a limb
here and I'm gonna guess...

23:31.839 --> 23:32.835
CIA?

23:32.840 --> 23:35.871
All lawyers, regardless of
where they practice,

23:35.876 --> 23:38.807
have tools at their disposal.

23:38.812 --> 23:41.844
LexisNexis, friends in high places,

23:41.849 --> 23:45.280
private investigators.

23:45.285 --> 23:48.383
Must be a pretty powerful
firm if it found stuff on us.

23:48.388 --> 23:51.424
Yeah, I know some pretty powerful people.

23:59.967 --> 24:01.199
[Sighs]

24:01.224 --> 24:03.378
Well, we can go around.

24:03.403 --> 24:05.467
It'll take a while, but...

24:05.472 --> 24:07.907
- I have a better idea.
- [Scoffs]

24:22.389 --> 24:25.658
I thought you said you
were scared of heights!

24:30.497 --> 24:32.331
[Exhales sharply]

24:40.274 --> 24:43.238
So, what were you in for?

24:43.243 --> 24:45.044
[Sighs]

24:47.047 --> 24:48.844
Mexico, you don't
necessarily go to prison

24:48.849 --> 24:49.912
because you did something.

24:49.917 --> 24:53.015
Ah. So, you pissed someone off?

24:53.020 --> 24:55.117
Yeah, something like that.

24:55.122 --> 24:56.952
Who?

24:56.957 --> 25:00.222
I know you talk about it.
You told Dayana.

25:00.227 --> 25:03.292
I don't talk about it.

25:03.297 --> 25:04.459
So, you're a journalist,

25:04.464 --> 25:06.261
and you don't want to share your story?

25:06.266 --> 25:09.464
Photojournalist is a
witness, not a writer.

25:09.469 --> 25:12.701
So you saw something you
weren't supposed to see.

25:12.706 --> 25:14.803
Took a picture of it, maybe.

25:14.808 --> 25:17.139
Well, you're not dead,
so it can't be that bad.

25:17.144 --> 25:19.641
Come on, just stop
interrogating me, okay, Fed?

25:19.646 --> 25:21.743
I'm just trying to get
to know you better.

25:21.748 --> 25:24.913
Yeah.

25:24.918 --> 25:27.582
But you know what happens
when you push someone

25:27.587 --> 25:29.584
and you push and you push and you push

25:29.589 --> 25:31.653
and they're tired and they're frustrated

25:31.658 --> 25:33.555
and they've done time in prison,

25:33.560 --> 25:35.490
and maybe you just
push a little too much?

25:35.495 --> 25:37.125
Maybe they don't like it.

25:37.130 --> 25:39.432
Maybe they snap.

25:43.254 --> 25:47.161
_

25:47.186 --> 25:48.614
_

26:03.190 --> 26:06.559
You know, you're the first new
face we've seen in a while.

26:08.462 --> 26:10.826
It's a pretty strange school reunion.

26:10.831 --> 26:12.661
Even the dropouts are here.

26:12.666 --> 26:15.597
Hostages as terrorists,
terrorists as hostages.

26:15.602 --> 26:17.833
I have no reason to
trust you or talk to you.

26:17.838 --> 26:20.439
Wow, you used to enjoy talking to me.

26:25.312 --> 26:26.975
Is there something you want, mate?

26:26.980 --> 26:29.144
To know why the hell you're here.

26:29.149 --> 26:30.545
Well, I don't know your
feelings on the matter,

26:30.550 --> 26:32.547
but I find beheading's a slight deterrent

26:32.552 --> 26:33.682
from leaving the building.

26:33.687 --> 26:34.816
At the G20.

26:34.821 --> 26:37.519
I agree with putting an
end to global surveillance.

26:37.524 --> 26:39.054
Why are you here, Ryan?

26:39.059 --> 26:40.555
Oh, well, I'm CIA.

26:40.560 --> 26:42.624
We both know that you aren't.

26:42.629 --> 26:46.995
We also know that anyone in this
room could be the terrorist.

26:47.000 --> 26:49.798
So, how about it? You one of them?

26:49.803 --> 26:50.832
What are you doing?

26:50.837 --> 26:52.901
Are you actively trying
to get us all killed?

26:52.906 --> 26:54.569
No, just one of us.

26:54.574 --> 26:56.375
- You're mad.
- I'm getting there.

26:56.400 --> 26:57.639
No, I'm innocent. I'm as innocent as you.

26:57.644 --> 26:58.874
You've never been innocent.

26:58.879 --> 27:01.343
Why don't you tell everyone what
you're really doing here, huh?

27:01.348 --> 27:04.179
What are you...

27:04.184 --> 27:05.747
I just got it.

27:05.752 --> 27:08.216
How do I know you're
not the terrorist, huh?

27:08.221 --> 27:10.036
[Grunting]

27:11.925 --> 27:13.889
Leigh: Stop it, both of you!

27:13.894 --> 27:15.590
Man: Watch it! Watch it!

27:15.595 --> 27:17.559
[Speaks Swahili]

27:17.564 --> 27:19.665
[Grunting]

27:21.735 --> 27:23.565
Ryan, don't!

27:23.570 --> 27:25.067
Alex: Ryan.

27:28.981 --> 27:30.992
_

27:31.070 --> 27:32.179
_

27:37.093 --> 27:40.616
- [Computer beeping]
- Owen: Hey.

27:40.621 --> 27:42.685
Is everything okay out there?

27:42.690 --> 27:45.788
No one's dead... yet.

27:45.793 --> 27:47.623
You okay?

27:47.628 --> 27:49.792
I can't talk about work with you.

27:49.797 --> 27:51.594
Yes, you can.

27:51.599 --> 27:54.630
I feel terrible complaining
about my career.

27:54.635 --> 27:58.475
You would kill to have the
problem I'm trying to solve.

28:00.308 --> 28:04.207
I recruited Qasim bin
Ahmed while at Oxford.

28:04.212 --> 28:07.659
I located Anwar al-Awlaki in Yemen.

28:07.684 --> 28:09.812
There is nobody as good
as I am in that region,

28:09.817 --> 28:12.582
and somewhere in a room,
people are making decisions

28:12.587 --> 28:15.952
about that region and
they're not including me.

28:15.957 --> 28:17.553
And they won't tell me why.

28:17.558 --> 28:19.455
They just stuck me here.

28:19.460 --> 28:21.422
And you're waiting for
them to tell you why?

28:21.447 --> 28:23.090
[Chuckles]

28:23.095 --> 28:25.259
Have you ever walked into a room

28:25.264 --> 28:27.233
and not seen everything
you needed to know

28:27.258 --> 28:29.597
before you'd even stepped foot inside?

28:29.602 --> 28:30.764
What are you doing waiting for them

28:30.769 --> 28:31.732
to tell you what's happening?

28:31.737 --> 28:33.267
Assess the situation.

28:33.272 --> 28:35.974
Get the intel for yourself.

28:37.943 --> 28:40.941
You are a great operative.

28:40.946 --> 28:43.548
Better than I ever was.

28:46.252 --> 28:48.152
You still miss it?

28:50.656 --> 28:53.057
[Sighs]

29:09.241 --> 29:11.171
You look thirsty.

29:11.176 --> 29:12.239
Do I?

29:12.244 --> 29:13.811
People can look thirsty.

29:13.836 --> 29:17.611
Yes. Thirst, hunger,
and fear add to making mistakes.

29:17.616 --> 29:20.447
You're better off
hydrating, staying focused,

29:20.452 --> 29:22.950
and making concentric
circles, widening out,

29:22.955 --> 29:25.189
marking your progress as you go.

29:26.358 --> 29:28.589
You took them off?!

29:28.594 --> 29:30.257
Why?!

29:30.262 --> 29:32.526
I don't know. I want to win.

29:32.531 --> 29:34.428
By making sure that I fail?

29:34.433 --> 29:37.164
This was a team exercise.

29:37.169 --> 29:38.532
Well, I'm not on your team.

29:38.537 --> 29:41.101
Besides, Owen said
day one there's no such thing

29:41.106 --> 29:42.069
as team in the CIA.

29:42.074 --> 29:46.110
But... how would you feel
about second place?

29:46.946 --> 29:49.176
You're helping me?

29:49.181 --> 29:50.611
Why?

29:50.616 --> 29:52.947
Because I like you.

29:52.952 --> 29:55.482
And unlike everyone else,
you don't lie about who you are.

29:55.487 --> 29:58.452
How are we gonna win?

29:58.457 --> 30:00.554
They told us to leave our phones there.

30:00.559 --> 30:01.822
I did.

30:01.827 --> 30:03.261
This is yours.

30:05.397 --> 30:08.132
Do you feel like a winner, Mom?

30:09.735 --> 30:14.368
Okay. I'm sorry.
I didn't mean anything by that.

30:14.373 --> 30:15.970
Now you're afraid of me.

30:15.975 --> 30:18.639
I'm not afraid of you.

30:18.644 --> 30:20.474
You think because I was in
prison that I'm dangerous,

30:20.479 --> 30:22.076
that you're unsafe around me?

30:22.081 --> 30:23.716
I don't know what to think right now.

30:23.741 --> 30:26.914
Did you know that in Mexico,
the cartels run the prisons,

30:26.919 --> 30:30.517
use them as power bases,
information centers,

30:30.522 --> 30:34.147
factories for training
soldiers and sicarios?

30:34.172 --> 30:35.389
I wanted the world to see that,

30:35.394 --> 30:37.691
for them to understand
what's going on in there.

30:37.696 --> 30:39.760
Only one way to do that.

30:39.765 --> 30:41.557
Did you get yourself arrested?

30:43.335 --> 30:44.760
Inside...

30:48.507 --> 30:50.846
I was so stupid to think
people would understand

31:28.647 --> 31:30.744
So, what are you waiting for?

31:30.749 --> 31:33.484
The hostages don't need to see you die.

31:35.454 --> 31:37.855
I wish you hadn't been here.

[Both grunting]

32:12.214 --> 32:14.796
Well, made it back by the deadline.

32:14.821 --> 32:16.044
How do you feel?

32:16.069 --> 32:17.191
- Pretty good.
- Yeah.

32:17.216 --> 32:19.434
Probably expecting to hear
how, uh... how well you did.

32:19.439 --> 32:21.636
Looking for some sort of,
uh, congratulations?

32:21.641 --> 32:24.906
Well, a 20-person tie on the
Murder Board would be great.

32:24.911 --> 32:25.607
Yeah.

32:25.612 --> 32:27.442
So, it took the first team...

32:27.447 --> 32:28.510
- Yes!
- [Applause]

32:28.515 --> 32:30.645
Took four hours from the
drop point to The Farm.

32:30.650 --> 32:32.747
Should've taken all of you
no more than 20 minutes.

32:32.752 --> 32:34.983
This morning, we taught you
all the skills you needed

32:34.988 --> 32:35.917
to get back quickly,

32:35.922 --> 32:37.819
and none of you applied what you learned.

32:37.824 --> 32:39.988
None of you counted how
long you were in the van,

32:39.993 --> 32:40.822
the sound of the terrain

32:40.827 --> 32:42.457
as the wheels turned off the road,

32:42.462 --> 32:44.292
counted how many times
the turn signal went on,

32:44.297 --> 32:45.560
'cause if you had, we wouldn't be having

32:45.565 --> 32:47.004

32:47.029 --> 32:48.951
Did you even notice you
were being watched?

32:48.976 --> 32:50.560
I thought I saw some cameras in trees.

32:50.585 --> 32:52.022
Owen: How many?

32:52.027 --> 32:53.090
Six?

32:53.115 --> 32:54.615
23.

32:54.640 --> 32:57.341
23 cameras and two drones flew overhead,

32:57.366 --> 32:58.896
and none of you noticed.

32:58.901 --> 33:02.133
All it takes is one camera
for the enemy to make you.

33:02.138 --> 33:04.084
You all got so distracted by the scenario

33:04.109 --> 33:07.163
that you just forgot
everything we taught you today.

33:07.188 --> 33:11.476
You panicked, overreacted, lost focus.

33:11.481 --> 33:15.780
Even in a crisis, you are still an
operative with a job to do.

33:15.785 --> 33:18.783
Never forget your training.

33:18.788 --> 33:20.785

Never lose the forest,
even when you're in the weeds.

33:28.831 --> 33:30.728
I would take LeÃ³n out
of the equation for now.

33:30.733 --> 33:34.465
I mean, he went to a cartel
prison on a mission to do good.

33:34.470 --> 33:37.134
Yeah, but what did he do to get in there?

33:37.139 --> 33:38.669
How did he get out?

33:38.674 --> 33:41.739
All right, with one bug,
we have to choose someone

33:41.744 --> 33:44.141
that's gonna talk when we listen, right?

33:44.146 --> 33:45.643
LeÃ³n's a locked box.

33:45.648 --> 33:47.011
I say Dayana.

33:47.016 --> 33:48.980
I mean, start with all
of those phone calls.

33:48.985 --> 33:50.615
- It's not Dayana.
- How do you know that?

33:50.620 --> 33:53.317
Because she's scared
out of her mind to be here.

33:53.322 --> 33:55.653
I saw it myself, and this morning

33:55.658 --> 33:59.261
you were all about LeÃ³n, so what changed?

34:00.796 --> 34:03.427
I just... I just got to know him better.

34:03.432 --> 34:05.363
Oh.

34:05.368 --> 34:08.466
Well, I got to know her a little better,
too, so what now?

34:08.471 --> 34:10.301
We just agree to disagree?

34:10.306 --> 34:12.003
No.

34:12.007 --> 34:16.274

one shot, how can we?

34:16.279 --> 34:18.085

34:18.110 --> 34:20.451
Okay, so who... Who's on both our lists?

34:20.476 --> 34:22.679
- [Cellphone vibrates]

34:22.685 --> 34:25.216
It's time. They're here.

34:25.221 --> 34:27.184
Are you sure about Harry?

34:27.188 --> 34:28.886
That's the conclusion we came to.

34:28.891 --> 34:31.222
You both came to equally?

34:31.226 --> 34:32.552
[Scoffs]

34:32.577 --> 34:35.626
I know you, and I know that
if Alex wants something,

34:35.630 --> 34:37.527
you want to be the one giving it to her.

34:37.533 --> 34:39.397
I also know that when you're around her,

34:39.402 --> 34:41.132
you don't follow your own instincts.

34:41.137 --> 34:42.867
You follow hers.

34:42.871 --> 34:44.902
This is a real mission.

34:44.907 --> 34:47.638
You have way more experience
with real operations

34:47.643 --> 34:48.906
than she does.

34:48.911 --> 34:50.645
Who do you really want?

34:52.148 --> 34:54.145
So, Harry's a complete mystery.

34:54.150 --> 34:55.746
Neither of us have been
able to pin him down.

34:55.751 --> 34:58.182
I mean, we know something
about everyone.

34:58.187 --> 34:59.650
We know nothing about him.

34:59.655 --> 35:01.752
So, what? LeÃ³n tells you a sad story,

35:01.757 --> 35:03.754
and all of a sudden, he's off the table?

35:03.759 --> 35:06.057
Alex, maybe he's done research about you.

35:06.062 --> 35:09.694
Maybe he knows you get
taken in by sad stories.

you've been standing right next to me.

36:38.375 --> 36:40.172

36:40.177 --> 36:43.508
Did you ask them to bring me here?

36:43.513 --> 36:44.328
What?

36:44.353 --> 36:46.311
Did you personally request

36:46.316 --> 36:48.213
to have me pulled off my station

36:48.218 --> 36:52.217
and sent to work here with you?

mean coming from you,

37:31.228 --> 37:33.859
But you did it anyway.

you were the best
