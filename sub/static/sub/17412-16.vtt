I don't mind letting you drink
for free, will,

00:05.639 --> 00:08.607
But the margin on olives
is very thin, so...

00:08.609 --> 00:10.676
            Oh, well, I'm making
              a point here, liz.

00:10.678 --> 00:13.078
        Each one of these olives
                represent a time

00:13.080 --> 00:15.080
    That we've hung out together
                   here at work.

00:15.082 --> 00:16.482
             - Aw.
           - Mm-hmm.

00:16.484 --> 00:18.617
So this is our
one, two, three...

00:18.619 --> 00:19.752
Fourth date!

00:19.754 --> 00:23.055
   No, a date is when you go out
       with someone to someplace

00:23.057 --> 00:24.089
                Other than their
                  place of work.

00:24.091 --> 00:26.058
                  What we've had
                     are visits.

00:26.060 --> 00:29.495
        Now, on our first visit,
 you told me all about your son.

00:29.497 --> 00:30.763
        And on our second visit,

00:30.765 --> 00:33.332
  You told me about how you lost
                  your virginity

00:33.334 --> 00:36.502
            And that abomination
     that you call a pinkie toe.

00:36.504 --> 00:37.736
           - [laughs]
     - in all seriousness,

00:37.738 --> 00:39.238
                 I love actually
           hanging out with you,

00:39.240 --> 00:43.142
       - What's going on?
- I know, I know, I know, but...

00:43.144 --> 00:45.210
Will, I am a single mom
working two jobs,

00:45.212 --> 00:48.047
And I have to tell you,
I have been burned before

00:48.049 --> 00:52.217
By guys with baggage and
messy, emotional attachments.

00:52.219 --> 00:53.786
There was a guy who
was divorcing his wife

00:53.788 --> 00:55.521
And then a guy
who lived with his mom

00:55.523 --> 00:58.757
And then the guy who bought
lingerie for his sister.

00:58.759 --> 01:00.659
            - Yikes.
     - Yeah, that happened.

01:00.661 --> 01:02.428
I need a guy
with no drama, no surprises.

01:02.430 --> 01:04.063
                     That is me.
              That's totally me.

01:04.065 --> 01:05.297
               I don't even have
                       a sister.

01:05.299 --> 01:08.300
Every single person
has their something,

01:08.302 --> 01:10.569
And I have yet to figure out
what yours is.

01:10.571 --> 01:12.704
                      I'm sorry.
        I am just this charming,

01:12.706 --> 01:15.107
            Drama-free gentleman
             you see before you.

01:15.109 --> 01:16.108
           - Really?
           - Mm-hmm.

01:16.110 --> 01:19.445
So no something?
Nothing weird?

01:19.447 --> 01:21.080
     [cell phone vibrates]

01:21.082 --> 01:22.781
      - Better take this.
          - All right.

                          Hello?

01:23.851 --> 01:26.285
        Don't hello me!
         Where are you?

             Andy, what the hell
              is going on there?

01:36.363 --> 01:38.330
The doula session
has gone dark, will.

01:38.332 --> 01:41.567
            Well, you're the one
   who wanted your umpteenth kid

          again, andy!

01:46.240 --> 01:48.807
I just want to listen
to the sound of a heart

That's never been broken.

Hey.
What was all that?

01:58.452 --> 02:00.752
                  Oh, cable guy.
         Yeah, scheduling snafu.

02:00.754 --> 02:03.689
But, uh, you were about to agree
        to go on a date with me.

02:03.691 --> 02:05.891
I want to.
I really do.

02:05.893 --> 02:07.626
But what free time
I do have,

02:07.628 --> 02:09.895
I mostly just spend it
running errands.

02:09.896 --> 02:11.230
               We could do that.
                 I love errands.

02:11.232 --> 02:12.798
You want to run errands
with me?

02:12.800 --> 02:14.433
        Well, I want to do a lot
        of things with you, liz,

02:14.435 --> 02:15.501
         But we can start there.

02:15.503 --> 02:16.702
      We can start with errands.

02:16.704 --> 02:18.170
Okay, let me
think about it.

02:18.172 --> 02:19.738
             You know, we can do
         some of my errands too.

02:19.740 --> 02:21.907
        You can help me pick out
         a nightie for my mommy.

02:21.909 --> 02:23.342

                           Yeah.

Yeah, but
caring support.

     makes it--makes it weirder.

of dr. Sam,

our losses together.

                     of quietude

we dig the memory hole.

Wow. You're really good
at digging, will.

05:10.544 --> 05:13.779
          Just out of curiosity,
    what is the memory hole for?

05:13.781 --> 05:14.913
Well, when it's
deep enough,

05:14.915 --> 05:15.947
Mom will throw in
all the things

05:15.949 --> 05:17.549
That remind her
of mr. Chris.

05:17.551 --> 05:18.984
              And how do we know
          when it's deep enough?

05:18.986 --> 05:20.452
Well, the depth
of the memory hole

05:20.454 --> 05:21.520
Is directly
proportionate

05:21.522 --> 05:24.990
To the depth
of mom's despair.

05:24.992 --> 05:27.326

think, mom?

   there might be some merit

      in the hole and get to it.

              of these in there.

06:48.175 --> 06:50.409
     Romeo and juliet, you know,
             two lovers burdened

06:50.411 --> 06:51.643
                 By circumstance
                       and time,

06:51.645 --> 06:53.612
           It just reminds me of
           me and sam, you know.

06:53.614 --> 06:54.713
             - Aw.
       - Maybe I haven't

06:54.715 --> 06:56.815
                Properly mourned
          what happened with us.

06:56.817 --> 06:59.084
          And I just feel like--
        I'm a wreck. Look at me.

06:59.086 --> 07:00.886
Well, you do seem
pretty sweaty.

07:00.888 --> 07:02.654
            I-I think I should--
           I think I should burn

07:02.656 --> 07:03.822
          Some of her stuff too.

07:03.824 --> 07:06.558
It's so brave of you
to face your emotions

07:06.560 --> 07:08.093
And purge
your painful memories.

07:08.095 --> 07:09.694
                           Yeah.
                It's so painful.

07:09.696 --> 07:11.430
               The thing is, uh,
              a lot of her stuff

07:11.432 --> 07:12.998
            Is in a storage unit
                     in oakland.

07:13.000 --> 07:14.433
                    I'll go grab
                       that now.

07:14.435 --> 07:16.568
         - In oakland?
- Yeah, it's about an hour away,

07:16.570 --> 07:18.804
        Two, three with traffic,
    so it shouldn't be too long.

07:18.806 --> 07:20.939
           Oh, okay.
   Well, I'll tell you what.

07:20.941 --> 07:22.974
  I'll eulogize chris's stuff

07:22.976 --> 07:24.576
      While you're getting
          sam's stuff,

07:24.578 --> 07:28.113
      And then we'll have
our ceremonial burning together.

07:28.115 --> 07:29.514
                         Really?
          You would wait for me?

07:29.516 --> 07:30.982
           - I would.
      - I'll be right back.

07:30.984 --> 07:33.084
Man, there's gonna be
so much healing today.

07:33.086 --> 07:34.486

          was laundry day, so...

07:40.561 --> 07:41.560
                       I got you
                  a little gift.

11:55.982 --> 11:58.083
            That it's kind of a,

12:09.096 --> 12:10.729
                 Since I've been
                     with a guy.

12:10.731 --> 12:12.430
        And it's definitely been
                     a long time

12:12.432 --> 12:16.401
        Since I've felt this way
                about one, so...

12:16.403 --> 12:19.037

to run back to--

12:30.784 --> 12:32.751
You know, the baby--
the baby is--

12:32.753 --> 12:35.420
The whole thing's
happening.

12:35.422 --> 12:37.989
                           Okay.

12:37.991 --> 12:41.893
     [cell phone vibrates]

12:41.895 --> 12:42.894
Marcus.

12:42.896 --> 12:44.129
                  Where are you?

12:44.131 --> 12:45.897
Sorry, man, I am just
in the gnarliest traffic.

12:45.899 --> 12:49.134
Um, do you mind delaying
the ceremonial burning?

12:49.136 --> 12:53.171
It's gonna take me
probably about an hour.

12:53.173 --> 12:55.206
           - An hour?
   - Actually, you know what?

12:55.208 --> 12:57.041
It's been a while
since I've done it, so...

12:57.043 --> 12:58.810
Probably
45 minutes, maybe.

12:58.812 --> 13:00.378
            - What?
   - What? Nothing, nothing.

13:00.380 --> 13:02.480
I'm gonna be there as soon
as I can, bud, all right?

13:02.482 --> 13:03.982
Right as
I get through the traffic.

13:03.984 --> 13:07.418
           So what item of sam's
          did you bring to burn?

13:07.420 --> 13:11.422
Uh, I'm gonna keep that
a surprise for you, big boy.

13:11.424 --> 13:13.424
      Will, a light just went on
                in your bedroom.

13:13.426 --> 13:14.959
                 There's someone
                  in your house!

13:14.961 --> 13:16.528
The traffic just lightened up.
It's a miracle!

13:16.530 --> 13:18.029
I'll be home
in two minutes!

13:18.031 --> 13:19.531
   - I'm gonna call the cops.
     - Don't call the cops!

13:19.533 --> 13:21.499
      Don't call the cops!
     Do not call the cops!

13:21.501 --> 13:23.434
Okay!
Where were we?

13:23.436 --> 13:25.036
                    [whispering]
      shh! You'll wake the baby!

13:25.038 --> 13:26.037
What baby?

13:26.039 --> 13:27.572
[whispering]
oh, yeah, right!

13:27.574 --> 13:28.973
What--yeah--

13:28.975 --> 13:31.576
Yeah, yeah, yeah, no,
everything's perfect.

13:31.578 --> 13:35.847
- Yeah, everything's good, yeah.
  - Everything's just perfect.

13:40.920 --> 13:43.154
         - There we go.
           - [laughs]

13:51.297 --> 13:53.031
                  Yeah.

13:53.033 --> 13:55.967
                   Ooh.
                [laughing]

14:00.372 --> 14:02.974
Um, um, um, um, you know
what I'm gonna do?

14:02.976 --> 14:05.310
I am gonna go
and get us some wine.

14:05.312 --> 14:08.313
         Uh, well, I think we're
      pretty past the wine part.

14:08.315 --> 14:10.949
Now, yes, but after, you know,
when we want the wine,

14:10.951 --> 14:12.183
I won't have to go down naked
and get it.

14:12.185 --> 14:14.385
You know what I mean?
Okay. I'll be right back.

14:14.387 --> 14:15.520
             - Oh.
          - Oh, uh...

14:15.522 --> 14:17.255
       Can I borrow this?

14:17.257 --> 14:18.556
     I'll just borrow this
          real quick.

14:18.558 --> 14:20.325
         My wine cellar
   gets a little bit drafty.

14:20.327 --> 14:22.527
   Well, why don't you just, uh,
            take your own shirt?

14:22.529 --> 14:24.128
Uh, 'cause--
well, I would, you know,

14:24.130 --> 14:27.165
But, uh, uh, I'm already
all the way over here.

14:27.167 --> 14:28.900
              Huh?

14:33.472 --> 14:35.573
Okay, guys,
I'm here.

14:35.575 --> 14:37.442
     Uh, I think we should
        call the police,

14:37.444 --> 14:39.043
   Because what if the person
       robbing your house

14:39.045 --> 14:40.979
 Comes through the dumbwaiter,
         robs my house?

14:40.981 --> 14:42.046
There's nobody
in my house.

14:42.048 --> 14:43.615
My bedroom light
is on a timer.

14:43.617 --> 14:45.483
It's an easy explanation,
totally plausible.

14:45.485 --> 14:47.252
Anyway, I'm here
for the burning ceremony,

14:47.254 --> 14:48.620
And I got sam's sweater,
so let's go!

14:48.622 --> 14:50.889
 Okay, well, you're gonna have
      to put sam's sweater

14:50.891 --> 14:53.024
      In the memory hole.

14:53.026 --> 14:54.893
I--you know, I had
a good cry with it in the car.

14:54.895 --> 14:56.895
A nice little sniffle with it,
and I rubbed some tears,

14:56.897 --> 14:58.196
And I feel, like,
real close to it,

14:58.198 --> 14:59.330
So I think I'm gonna
hold on to it,

14:59.332 --> 15:01.199
If that's all right,
do sort of a--

15:01.201 --> 15:03.601
     Quick like a band-aid,
         I always say.

15:06.138 --> 15:07.605
                Good-bye, chris.

15:07.607 --> 15:10.475
              Good-bye, memories
                       of chris.

15:10.477 --> 15:13.945
                 Good-bye, love.

15:13.947 --> 15:15.914
                  Unity embrace!

15:15.916 --> 15:17.482
                    Ah, come on,
                  unity embrace.

15:17.484 --> 15:18.483
                        Come on.

15:18.485 --> 15:21.352
               Release the pain!

15:21.354 --> 15:24.022
       (fiona and marcus)
       release the pain!

15:24.024 --> 15:28.293
     Shh. I need to release
       the pain silently.

15:28.295 --> 15:31.062
    There we go. Okay, guys,
   you know what I got to do?

15:31.064 --> 15:32.330
       I'm gonna go check
         on that timer.

15:32.332 --> 15:33.598
       I feel like I need
          to reset it.

15:33.600 --> 15:35.600
No, wait, will.
In order for the ritual

15:35.602 --> 15:37.535
     To be complete, we all have
        to stand around the fire

15:37.537 --> 15:39.203
                  Until it burns
                 completely out.

15:39.205 --> 15:41.072
        Completely out?

15:41.074 --> 15:42.540
Yeah, the embers burn out,

15:42.542 --> 15:44.409
And our pain disappears
with the smoke!

15:48.114 --> 15:50.548
You know what? I'm sorry.
This is ridiculous.

15:50.550 --> 15:52.216
         Hey, hey, you!
              No!

15:52.218 --> 15:54.719
        Get off! What is
      the matter with you?

15:54.721 --> 15:56.454
              Why can't you take
                 this seriously?

15:56.456 --> 16:00.725
 That you must ruin the sanctity
       of the day of reflection?

16:00.727 --> 16:05.596
           - [groans]
            - will.

16:05.598 --> 16:08.132
          Too bad you just threw
    sam's sweater into the fire.

16:08.134 --> 16:11.636
 Looks like that girl over there
            could really use it.

16:18.010 --> 16:19.344
             - Hi.
             - Hi.

16:19.346 --> 16:22.213
       Um, what the hell
         is this, will?

16:22.215 --> 16:24.182
                      Uh...Uh...

16:24.184 --> 16:26.017
        Oh, no, is this
          your family?

16:26.019 --> 16:27.752
                No, no, it's not
                      my family.

16:27.754 --> 16:30.621
  Oh, my god, are you in some
   sort of weird, pagan cult?

16:30.623 --> 16:32.290
        - No, no, no...
        - Hey, hey, hey!

16:32.292 --> 16:33.591
We are not a cult.

16:33.593 --> 16:36.060
Please, uh, let me--
liz, I can explain.

16:36.062 --> 16:37.528
    Okay, you know what? I don't
   even think I need to hear it.

16:37.530 --> 16:39.163
Thank you, will,
for once again putting marcus

16:39.165 --> 16:40.732
And my emotional needs
in the backseat

16:40.734 --> 16:43.201
To one of your
vapid sexual conquests.

16:43.203 --> 16:44.769
 - No! You are not a conquest!
          - Excuse me?

16:44.771 --> 16:47.005
    - You're not a conquest.
      - Okay, I don't know

16:47.007 --> 16:49.107
            What any of this is,
               but it is clearly

16:49.109 --> 16:51.509
                 Some very messy
                  baggage, so...

16:51.511 --> 16:53.077
       No, no, it's not.
          Liz, please!

16:53.079 --> 16:54.212
        - I can explain.
          - Carry on!

16:54.214 --> 16:56.180
                    Stop! Don't!

16:56.182 --> 16:58.116
       Will, I was really hoping
             you were different,

16:58.118 --> 17:00.351
                     But I guess
                    I was wrong.

17:00.353 --> 17:02.353
           I am--I--

17:02.355 --> 17:04.756
              Liz!

17:04.758 --> 17:05.790
            [groans]

17:05.791 --> 17:07.692
           Thank you.

17:07.694 --> 17:09.359
   Thank you for that, fiona.

17:09.362 --> 17:10.762
           Are you guys arguing?
            Should I be leaving?

17:10.763 --> 17:12.663
Wait. You're the one
who abandoned me

17:12.665 --> 17:15.133
In my time of need
to hang out with that--

17:15.135 --> 17:16.334
Close your ears,
marcus--

17:16.336 --> 17:17.335
Strumpet.

17:17.337 --> 17:20.471
                      She is not
        a one-night stand, okay?

17:20.473 --> 17:23.340
        She's just a normal girl
        looking for a normal guy

17:23.343 --> 17:24.608
   Without any drama or baggage,

17:24.611 --> 17:26.243
           And that's impossible
                    for me to be

17:26.246 --> 17:27.345
            When I'm hanging out
             with you and marcus

17:27.347 --> 17:29.580
        Burning trash in a yard.
                             I--

17:29.582 --> 17:32.050
                         Listen,
              I like her, fiona.

17:32.052 --> 17:35.153
         I like her a lot, okay?

17:35.155 --> 17:36.521
Why didn't you
just tell me?

17:36.523 --> 17:39.090
         Because you were having
                such a hard time

17:39.092 --> 17:40.758
           And you're suffering,
and I didn't want to be bragging

17:40.760 --> 17:43.127
         About how I was falling
                   for somebody.

17:43.129 --> 17:47.165
             You know, it's like
 throwing salt in an open wound.

17:47.167 --> 17:49.300
                     This is why
          I didn't say anything.

17:49.302 --> 17:51.569
These aren't tears
of sadness for me.

17:51.571 --> 17:53.538
They're tears
of happiness for you.

17:53.540 --> 17:56.641
I mean, if love
can grow

17:56.643 --> 18:01.446
In the putrid soil
of your tiny fractured heart,

18:01.448 --> 18:04.415
Then, you know,
maybe there's hope for me.

18:04.417 --> 18:07.085
        - This is so...
          - [sniffles]

18:07.087 --> 18:09.620
You know, you should go and tell
liz how you feel right now.

18:09.622 --> 18:12.723
Well, what about the memory hole
             and all that stuff?

18:12.725 --> 18:14.092
Oh, marcus and I
will mourn,

18:14.094 --> 18:15.460
And I've chucked enough
lighter fluid on it.

18:15.462 --> 18:17.295
It'll be burning
well after you get back.

18:17.297 --> 18:20.698
            - Go on.
            - Okay.

18:20.700 --> 18:24.202
         [door closes,
      indistinct chatter]

18:24.204 --> 18:27.271
Liz, hey.
Can we go talk somewhere?

18:27.273 --> 18:29.373
                    I'm working.

18:29.375 --> 18:31.776
Can I have a beer, then?

18:31.778 --> 18:33.311
Listen, it turns out,
you know,

18:33.313 --> 18:35.379
I do have a "something,"
and I'm really sorry

18:35.381 --> 18:36.714
I didn't tell you
about it sooner--

18:36.716 --> 18:37.782
             That's ten dollars.

18:37.784 --> 18:40.785
Really? No more freebies.
Okay.

18:40.787 --> 18:45.590
I am so sorry I didn't
tell you about fiona and marcus.

18:45.592 --> 18:48.593
They're not something that's
easy to talk about or explain

18:48.595 --> 18:49.861
Or even understand,

18:49.863 --> 18:52.797
But they are definitely
my "something."

18:52.799 --> 18:57.435
They're my weird,
vegan, ridiculously
codependent neighbors.

18:57.437 --> 18:59.604
Actually, you know, if I'm being
completely honest with you,

18:59.606 --> 19:02.473
They are a little bit
more than that.

19:02.475 --> 19:04.375
My relationship with them
is not something

19:04.377 --> 19:05.643
That I would've ever asked for,

19:05.645 --> 19:07.512
But they've become
this kind of strange,

19:07.514 --> 19:09.580
Unexpected part of my life,

19:09.582 --> 19:13.751
And, frankly,
they're important to me.

19:13.753 --> 19:15.920
But the woman,
the weird mom--

19:15.922 --> 19:18.289
That relationship
is strictly platonic,

19:18.291 --> 19:20.224
Like, violently
platonic.

19:20.226 --> 19:22.360
And the little dude
is good for me,

19:22.362 --> 19:24.395
And for a kid whose dad
is, like, a million miles away,

19:24.397 --> 19:28.766
I am, like, really good
for him too.

19:28.768 --> 19:30.768
So, yes, I have
a "something."

19:30.770 --> 19:32.837
But so does everybody,
right?

19:32.839 --> 19:34.939
             (all)
             yeah.

19:34.941 --> 19:37.842
I mean, not that I'm
in any place to judge,

19:37.844 --> 19:39.544
But this gentleman
to my right

19:39.546 --> 19:42.446
Probably has some issues
with alcohol.

19:44.650 --> 19:46.584
Look, liz...

19:46.586 --> 19:49.654
I am so sorry
I didn't tell you sooner,

19:49.656 --> 19:54.592
But I like you,
like, really like you.

19:54.594 --> 19:56.661
And I would love it
if you'd give me another chance.

19:56.663 --> 19:58.462
        Come on.
    Give it to him.

19:58.464 --> 20:01.199
       [patrons shouting
         encouragement]

20:06.271 --> 20:09.640
     [cheers and applause]

20:11.810 --> 20:13.644
                        I can do
                weird neighbors.

20:13.646 --> 20:14.946
That's definitely
gonna be tested.

20:14.948 --> 20:16.681
         [both chuckle]

20:16.683 --> 20:19.517
     [cheers and applause]

20:19.519 --> 20:20.651
Are we sure
this guy's okay?

20:20.653 --> 20:22.720
Is he with anybody?

20:26.692 --> 20:29.660
                       The fire,
                it's almost out.

20:29.662 --> 20:31.729
            This must be what it
        feels like to sit shiva.

20:31.731 --> 20:35.366
   I cannot believe it burned
   through the entire night,

20:35.368 --> 20:38.402
   Through the driving rain,
       the howling wind.

20:38.404 --> 20:40.304
We definitely should've gone in
  during the lightning storm.

20:40.306 --> 20:41.539
      That was ridiculous.

20:41.541 --> 20:43.774
This might be the most
stubborn batch of memories

20:43.776 --> 20:44.875
We've ever burned.

20:44.877 --> 20:45.876
         [fire sizzles]

20:45.878 --> 20:46.911
                [both gasp]

20:46.913 --> 20:48.246
                       It's out.

20:48.248 --> 20:50.014
                       It's out!

20:50.016 --> 20:52.450
        [bugle playing]
 - ah! Ow! What are you doing?

20:52.452 --> 20:54.318
Reveille!

20:54.320 --> 20:56.687
The day of reflection
is over!

20:56.689 --> 20:57.888
         Oh, thank god!

20:57.890 --> 21:00.658
Let the week
of sorrow begin!

21:00.660 --> 21:02.660
         - What? What?
 - I'll start sewing the robes.

21:02.662 --> 21:06.864
            No, no!
              No!

21:07.399 --> 21:09.467
          [dog barks]
