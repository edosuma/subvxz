00:00.142 --> 00:02.342
Psst! Psst! Psst! Galavant.

00:02.343 --> 00:04.376
Galavant! Galavant, wake up.

00:04.377 --> 00:05.843
G-Galavant! Wake up!

00:05.845 --> 00:07.146
I have incredible news!

00:07.147 --> 00:08.547
Ugh!

00:08.548 --> 00:09.948
Is that news that you've
misplaced your toothbrush?

00:09.949 --> 00:12.051
Zinger! No.

00:12.052 --> 00:14.119
No, you know how today we're heading
into the land of the Giants

00:14.120 --> 00:15.454
to offer them the Jewel of Valencia

00:15.455 --> 00:17.489
in exchange for joining our
quest to save Princess Isabella?

00:17.490 --> 00:19.691
Yes, we discussed it last night
in great detail.

00:19.692 --> 00:21.660
There's no need for your clunky exposition.

00:21.661 --> 00:24.363
Well, I have managed to trade the jewel

00:24.364 --> 00:26.065
for something even better than an army.

00:26.266 --> 00:27.966
You traded the jewel?

00:27.967 --> 00:29.601
Yep. For a dragon.

00:29.602 --> 00:31.136
Can you believe it?

00:31.137 --> 00:33.505
Imagine how our foes will run in terror!

00:33.506 --> 00:35.607
Well, I mean, once he grows a little.

00:35.608 --> 00:38.844
I'm going to call him Tad Cooper...

00:38.845 --> 00:41.947
A name that evokes strength
and valor and bravery.

00:41.948 --> 00:43.148
What do you think?

00:43.149 --> 00:45.584
I think you're a complete idiot,

00:45.585 --> 00:47.419
and you're taking it back.

00:47.420 --> 00:48.520
Now.

00:48.521 --> 00:50.122
But, no, I ca... I can't.

00:50.123 --> 00:51.556
I pinkie swore and said "no backsies."

00:51.557 --> 00:54.259
You do realize that without
a jewel, I have no army,

00:54.260 --> 00:57.195
and without an army, I have no
chance of rescuing Isabella.

00:57.196 --> 00:59.431
Well... Hey, where you going?

00:59.432 --> 01:01.967
To find the Giants... Without you.

01:01.968 --> 01:03.502
What? Why?

01:03.503 --> 01:05.570
Because I am done.

01:05.571 --> 01:07.906
I am done cleaning up your mess.

01:07.907 --> 01:10.008
I am done telling you that
it's not your fault,

01:10.009 --> 01:12.244
because... news flash,
Richard... it <i> is</i> your fault.

01:12.245 --> 01:14.746
I'm done with your weakness,
with your whining,

01:14.747 --> 01:15.647
but most of all,

01:15.648 --> 01:18.717
I am done with you!

01:18.718 --> 01:20.352
Okay.

01:20.353 --> 01:22.788
I admit, I'm on a bit of an unlucky streak,

01:22.789 --> 01:25.424
but I am destined for great things.

01:25.425 --> 01:26.792
You'll see.

01:26.793 --> 01:28.794
You have about as much chance
of great things

01:28.795 --> 01:31.263
as that lizard does of breathing fire.

01:31.264 --> 01:35.033
It's a dragon, and it <i> can</i> breathe fire.

01:35.034 --> 01:37.135
Show him, Tad Cooper!

01:37.136 --> 01:39.104
Show him.

01:39.105 --> 01:41.106
Come on.

01:41.107 --> 01:42.708
The perfect pair...

01:42.709 --> 01:45.377
A dragon that isn't a dragon...

01:45.378 --> 01:47.979
And a king that isn't a king.

01:47.980 --> 01:51.482
Well, I am done with you, too!

01:54.620 --> 01:57.856
Hello?

01:57.857 --> 01:59.323
Hello?

02:01.160 --> 02:04.229
Guess I'm eating breakfast by myself, then.

02:04.230 --> 02:05.964
"You can't do anything right, Richard.

02:05.965 --> 02:07.499
Everything's a disaster, Richard.

02:07.500 --> 02:08.834
You've ruined my life, Richard.

02:08.835 --> 02:11.002
That's not a real dragon, Richard."

02:11.002 --> 02:12.371
Well, you know what?

02:12.372 --> 02:15.974
Galavant may not believe in you, but I do.

02:15.975 --> 02:18.910

04:12.710 --> 04:15.578
Oh, I'm ever so excited
about my special day.

04:15.579 --> 04:16.678
Aww.

04:16.680 --> 04:17.747
Barry...

04:17.748 --> 04:20.849
Place the order.

04:21.952 --> 04:24.821
My plan is working to perfection.

04:24.822 --> 04:25.822
It appears so, sir.

04:25.823 --> 04:27.357
Once Isabella becomes queen,

04:27.358 --> 04:29.992
you will be the most powerful
man in all of Hortensia.

04:29.993 --> 04:31.060
No.

04:31.061 --> 04:34.897
Why, the wedding plan, you twit.

04:34.898 --> 04:37.834
Do you think I'd discuss
the evil plans so publicly?

04:37.835 --> 04:39.669
This is why I thought we agreed

04:39.670 --> 04:41.904
to call one "the plan"
and the other "the plot"

04:41.905 --> 04:43.506
to avoid these kind of mix-ups.

04:43.507 --> 04:48.378
Barry, what is so hard to understand?

04:48.379 --> 04:50.146
We have two plans, right?

04:50.147 --> 04:51.681
One's evil and the other...

04:51.682 --> 04:54.784
Sorry. Moving on.

04:54.785 --> 04:57.587
Um, we have a serious issue to discuss.

04:57.588 --> 05:01.958
We've had most of the RSVPs,
except a Princess Jubilee.

05:01.959 --> 05:03.626
I need to know if she's coming.

05:03.627 --> 05:06.095
Just mark her as a "yes"
and order the steak.

05:06.096 --> 05:07.964
I'm not paying, so I don't care.

05:07.965 --> 05:09.866
Really?

05:09.867 --> 05:11.601
Well, I do care, sir.

05:12.669 --> 05:14.771
Barry, go on. Tell them the mirror idea.

05:14.772 --> 05:17.874
He's going to hand-draw each guest's name

05:17.875 --> 05:20.609
and table number on a fancy mirror.

05:22.146 --> 05:24.680
Way to undersell it, Barry.

05:24.681 --> 05:26.816
It's a masterstroke.

05:26.817 --> 05:28.718
It's both functional and a work of art,

05:28.719 --> 05:31.521
but it'll all be for naught if
the guest list isn't finalized.

05:31.522 --> 05:33.389

Isabella, you think my mirror
is a good idea, don't you?

05:42.499 --> 05:46.736
Oh, yes. It's a masterstroke.

05:46.737 --> 05:50.239
Okay, Mr. Wormwood, I don't know
what you're up to,

05:50.240 --> 05:52.775
but my daughter has been
acting very strangely

05:52.776 --> 05:55.077
since you arrived, and I have had enough.

05:55.078 --> 05:57.747
Isabella, seems your mother

05:57.748 --> 05:59.649
doesn't want your wedding to be perfect.

05:59.650 --> 06:01.017
Perhaps she should be somewhere else.

You know, somewhere secure...
And damp. Hmm?

Do you mind if I just ask

09:17.214 --> 09:19.248
what started the feud with the Dwarves?

09:20.417 --> 09:22.118
Must you grumble every time
I saw "Dwarves"?

09:23.754 --> 09:25.187
Give it a rest!

09:25.188 --> 09:27.990
Started generations ago.

09:27.991 --> 09:31.260
We were building a bridge
to unite our two peoples...

09:31.261 --> 09:34.230
Half by us and half by them.

09:34.231 --> 09:36.666
When the day came to unveil the bridge,

09:36.667 --> 09:39.802
they had built their side too low.

09:39.803 --> 09:41.971
And those whiny little bitches

09:41.972 --> 09:45.041
blamed us for building our side too high.

09:45.042 --> 09:47.410
We have been at war ever since.

09:49.146 --> 09:51.746
Oh, come on.

09:54.818 --> 09:55.918
These aren't dwarves.

09:55.919 --> 09:58.287
We are, too. We're very tall dwarves.

09:58.288 --> 09:59.522
Oh, you've got to be kidding.

09:59.523 --> 10:00.990
Look at their hideous little bodies.

10:01.925 --> 10:03.125
Hideous?

10:03.126 --> 10:05.194
You are the same height!

10:05.195 --> 10:06.862
You could literally be brothers.

10:06.863 --> 10:10.499
Spoken like a true giant.

10:10.500 --> 10:13.234
A giant jerkface, that is.

10:16.573 --> 10:18.189
Hello, Galavant.

10:18.190 --> 10:19.524
You're looking well.

10:19.525 --> 10:21.459
I saw you this morning, you idiot.

10:21.660 --> 10:22.994
I thought I got rid of you.

10:22.995 --> 10:24.729
You thought wrong, then, didn't you?

10:24.730 --> 10:26.664
It's fitting to see you take up
with the Giants,

10:26.665 --> 10:29.033
considering you're a <i>humongous</i> blowhard.

10:31.136 --> 10:33.004
Well, then, I think it's rather fitting

10:33.005 --> 10:34.839
that you've fallen in with the Dwarves,

10:34.840 --> 10:37.208
considering you've been of
<i>little</i> use to me.

10:37.209 --> 10:38.943
Oh, no, he didn't!

10:38.944 --> 10:41.612
Forget the meeting! Let's go now!

10:42.715 --> 10:45.049
Stop!

10:45.050 --> 10:47.084
Guys, a word?

10:50.889 --> 10:52.390
What the hell is going on?

10:52.391 --> 10:53.458
You desert me at camp,

10:53.459 --> 10:55.059
I spend the whole day tracking you,

10:55.060 --> 10:56.894
only to find you're about to join a battle

10:56.895 --> 11:00.198
between two groups of
very similar 5'10" men.

11:00.199 --> 11:01.332
He lost the Jewel of Valencia!

11:01.333 --> 11:02.500
He doesn't believe in my dragon!

11:02.501 --> 11:04.101
Wait. Wh... dragon?

11:06.238 --> 11:07.939
I'm... I'm sorry, that's...Not a lizard?

11:07.940 --> 11:10.141
Don't. Not you, too.

11:10.142 --> 11:12.276
Look, my point is, these guys
seem really serious

11:12.277 --> 11:13.377
about killing each other.

11:13.378 --> 11:15.847
Don't you see how ridiculous this is?

11:15.848 --> 11:18.549
Do you really want to die...

11:18.550 --> 11:20.917
In a battle this ludicrous?

11:22.621 --> 11:24.555
If it gives me a shot at Richard, yes.

11:24.556 --> 11:25.957
Ditto, big boy!

11:25.958 --> 11:27.391
Let's go to war!

11:27.392 --> 11:30.528
Tomorrow, we fight...
Giants versus Dwarves.

11:31.663 --> 11:34.598
Billy, Billy. Billy,
you're a giant. Come on.

11:38.437 --> 11:41.672
So, hey, have you, um... By any chance

11:41.673 --> 11:43.808
told Queen Madalena how you feel about her?

11:43.809 --> 11:45.710
Gonna do it tonight.

11:45.711 --> 11:47.145
Great.

11:47.146 --> 11:50.548
Or... and just thinking out loud here...

11:50.549 --> 11:52.283
What i... What if you don't?

11:52.284 --> 11:54.085
What are you trying to say?

11:54.086 --> 11:56.821
There's something I need to say,
but before I do,

11:56.822 --> 11:58.990
have you ever heard of the Bro Code?

11:58.991 --> 12:01.559
Is that a black thing?

12:01.560 --> 12:05.229
It means, "what's said between
guys stays between guys."

12:05.231 --> 12:08.233
Look, don't fall in love with the queen.

12:08.233 --> 12:09.834
She's bad news.

12:09.835 --> 12:11.769
Think about her last three relationships.

12:11.770 --> 12:15.273
They ended in betrayal, exile, and murder.

12:15.274 --> 12:18.843
She will rip your heart out,
and I don't mean symbolically.

12:20.546 --> 12:22.880
Yeah, you're right.

12:22.881 --> 12:25.850
But she's so skinny and mean.

12:25.851 --> 12:28.019
Just blinded me.

12:28.020 --> 12:29.821
Thanks for having my back.

12:29.822 --> 12:33.024
Hey, it's what friends are for.

12:33.025 --> 12:34.759
Friends? You think we're friends?

12:34.760 --> 12:37.562
Well, I'm a little worried that
if I give you the wrong answer,

12:37.563 --> 12:40.064
you'll kill me right where I sit, but...

12:40.065 --> 12:42.767
Yeah, I've come to consider you a friend.

12:42.768 --> 12:44.769
Well, to friends, then.

Roberta, what are you doing?

17:46.524 --> 17:47.724
Fixing the bridge.

17:47.725 --> 17:49.526
You're fighting over nothing.

17:50.795 --> 17:52.796
You've been so busy arguing
this whole journey

17:52.797 --> 17:55.031
that you can't see that you
actually need each other.

17:55.032 --> 17:57.300
Ha! Please. I do <i> not</i> need him.

17:57.301 --> 17:59.970
What's been your sole purpose
this entire time, huh?

17:59.971 --> 18:02.706

got to join your quest?

18:07.011 --> 18:08.178

You, Richard. She's talking about you.

Oh.

18:14.852 --> 18:16.520
Roberta's right.

18:16.521 --> 18:18.989
I'm sorry. I've been using
so many horrible words

18:18.990 --> 18:20.657
to describe you that...

18:20.658 --> 18:22.759
I've forgotten the one
that describes you best.

18:22.760 --> 18:23.860

Loyal.

18:31.769 --> 18:33.970
It would be my honor.

18:33.971 --> 18:36.673
But first, I must ask...

18:36.674 --> 18:41.077
Do you believe that Tad Cooper
is actually a dragon?

18:42.180 --> 18:43.647
I believe...

18:43.648 --> 18:45.782
You believe he is.

18:45.783 --> 18:48.285
I knew it. Do you hear that?

18:48.286 --> 18:49.920
He believes in us, Tad Cooper.

18:52.256 --> 18:54.024
off to Hortensia.

18:54.025 --> 18:56.226
Actually, I think we need to bow out.

18:56.227 --> 18:57.861
Before we do any more fighting,

18:57.862 --> 19:00.596
I think there's a certain bridge
that needs our attention.

19:02.033 --> 19:03.533
What say you, Giant?

19:03.534 --> 19:05.535
Right you are, Dwarf.

19:05.536 --> 19:07.637
Right you are.
