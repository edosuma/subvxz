01:12.745 --> 01:15.080
I didn't know you were into scrapbooking.

01:15.114 --> 01:17.082
- Didn't know we were speaking.
- We're not.

01:17.116 --> 01:19.024
Thought I'd get a head start
on your next case.

01:19.049 --> 01:21.210
See, that sounds like a conversation.

01:21.235 --> 01:22.702
Earl Slavitt... Shot and killed

01:22.727 --> 01:25.129
an Assistant U.S. Attorney,
a man named Tom Simon.

01:25.154 --> 01:27.155
Fascinating.
I still don't want to hear it.

01:27.226 --> 01:29.861
Tom was a good friend.
We were roommates in law school.

01:29.896 --> 01:31.229
I was the best man at his wedding.

01:31.264 --> 01:33.064
Where you embarrassed him with a story

01:33.099 --> 01:35.333
about the time he choked
on a live goldfish.

01:35.368 --> 01:37.602
Hayes, this is Susan Simon, Tom's wife.

01:37.637 --> 01:39.104
I'm sorry for your loss.

01:39.138 --> 01:40.739
Nice to meet you.

01:40.773 --> 01:43.041
I voted for your mother...
absentee ballot.

01:43.075 --> 01:45.010
I keep forgetting to do that.

01:45.044 --> 01:46.711
I'm sure that has no deeper meaning.

01:46.746 --> 01:48.046
Well, thank you for taking the case.

01:48.080 --> 01:49.114
I know Tom would've wanted this,

01:49.148 --> 01:51.683
and I brought all of the files
from his home office.

01:51.717 --> 01:53.166
I will dive right in after breakfast.

01:53.191 --> 01:56.354
Wallace, will you help me
find the Wheaties?

01:56.389 --> 01:58.346
- You can't just come...
- Thought we aren't speaking.

01:58.371 --> 02:01.226
We're not, so whatever ulterior motive
you have, you can shove it up your...

02:01.260 --> 02:03.295
Look, I know I shouldn't have
come in here...

02:03.329 --> 02:05.397
And pretended to be protecting
me from the U.S. Attorney

02:05.431 --> 02:07.732
when in reality,
my parents were protecting you.

02:07.767 --> 02:11.403
Yes, but I'm hoping we can put
that aside for Tom and his wife.

02:11.437 --> 02:13.271
She just heard Earl lost
his last appeal,

02:13.306 --> 02:15.106
and she's desperate to know
for sure he's guilty,

02:15.141 --> 02:17.108
that his punishment is appropriate.

02:17.143 --> 02:19.244
Tom was a staunch advocate
against the death penalty.

02:19.278 --> 02:21.646
Okay, but New York State doesn't
permit capital punishment.

02:21.681 --> 02:23.114
But the United States does.
The man who killed Tom

02:23.149 --> 02:25.116
was convicted
on a federal murder charge.

02:25.151 --> 02:28.253
He's going to be executed...
in five days.

02:31.123 --> 02:36.616

<font color="#0080ff">www.</font>addic7ed<font color="#0080ff">.com</font>

02:37.615 --> 02:39.440
You started a new case without us?

02:39.465 --> 02:41.333
- No, I did.
- And he's just leaving.

02:41.367 --> 02:43.935
- I'm working this one with you.
- Let's not fight in front of the kids.

02:43.970 --> 02:45.737
Nothing to fight about. I'm your boss.

02:45.771 --> 02:48.139
The victim is my friend,
and it's a death-penalty case,

02:48.174 --> 02:49.641
so, yeah, I'm working it with you.

02:49.675 --> 02:50.809
The death penalty?

02:50.843 --> 02:52.143
This is the Tom Simon case.

02:52.178 --> 02:53.979
The victim was an A.U.S.A.

02:54.013 --> 02:55.313
His murder's a capital offense.

02:55.348 --> 02:57.849
Earl Slavitt was convicted
on federal fraud charges

02:57.884 --> 03:00.018
for embezzling a half a million
dollars from Fenton Bank.

03:00.052 --> 03:01.753
He served three years.

03:01.787 --> 03:02.921
A week after his release,

03:02.955 --> 03:05.957
he shot Tom Simon, the A.U.S.A.
who prosecuted the case.

03:05.992 --> 03:06.992
Where's Earl now?

03:07.026 --> 03:09.160
Federal penitentiary in Indiana.

03:09.195 --> 03:11.162
Execution is in five days.

03:11.197 --> 03:12.330
Oh, hell, no.

03:12.365 --> 03:13.965
Hell no because there's not enough time,

03:14.000 --> 03:17.335
or because killing a man for killing
a man is redundant and hypocritical?

03:17.370 --> 03:19.004
'Cause all of that, and people change.

03:19.038 --> 03:20.272
Or aren't guilty.

03:20.306 --> 03:25.176
Since 1973, 156 people have been
exonerated while on death row.

03:25.211 --> 03:27.012
Nobody can be sure of anything.

03:27.046 --> 03:28.886
True, but until
they abolish capital punishment

03:28.915 --> 03:30.482
- across the board...
- Off with their heads.

03:30.516 --> 03:33.975
It is the rule of law and our job to
enforce it, whether we like it or not.

03:34.053 --> 03:36.188
Way not to take a side, Sam.

03:36.222 --> 03:37.923
Sorry. Parent-teacher conference.

03:37.957 --> 03:40.273
We were just exchanging views
on the death penalty.

03:40.298 --> 03:41.927
Actually, I was presenting a case.

03:46.799 --> 03:49.100
When Tom was shot,
fragments of the bullet

03:49.154 --> 03:50.936
couldn't be removed from his brain.

03:50.970 --> 03:52.704
Earl went away for attempted murder.

03:52.738 --> 03:54.940
Two years later,
the bullet fragment shifted,

03:54.974 --> 03:58.404
Tom died, attempted murder
became federal capital murder.

03:58.429 --> 03:59.849
Maxine, yea or nay?

03:59.883 --> 04:01.624
Punishment isn't really my thing.

04:01.649 --> 04:03.256
I prefer to focus on the investigation.

04:03.281 --> 04:04.816
What if it was your kid
who was the victim?

04:04.851 --> 04:06.718
I'd flip the switch myself.

04:06.752 --> 04:09.387
Capital punishment is immoral,
unconstitutional...

04:09.422 --> 04:11.637
- Untrue...
- it is cruel, unusual punishment,

04:11.662 --> 04:14.528
it is unfairly applied,
it has no deterrent value,

04:14.553 --> 04:16.528
and don't even try
to argue it is a money thing,

04:16.553 --> 04:19.082
because it's way more expensive
to execute someone

04:19.107 --> 04:20.832
than to let them rot in prison
until they die.

04:20.867 --> 04:22.377
I'm well aware of your views.

04:22.402 --> 04:26.043
That's part of why I wanted you
on the case... for balance.

04:26.441 --> 04:27.939
The weapon was found at the scene.

04:27.974 --> 04:29.303
No serial numbers on it.

04:29.328 --> 04:31.842
It was a ghost gun...
a homemade gun put together

04:31.867 --> 04:33.645
with parts from different manufacturers,

04:33.670 --> 04:36.314
none of which have a serial number.
Totally untraceable.

04:36.349 --> 04:39.918
And a preferred weapon of experienced
felons, not high-end embezzlers.

04:39.952 --> 04:41.786
Prosecution argued
Earl may have gone into prison

04:41.821 --> 04:44.236
a white-collar criminal, but
he came out a stone-cold killer.

04:44.261 --> 04:45.757
He had no alibi.

04:45.791 --> 04:47.459
He sent Tom threatening letters.

04:47.493 --> 04:48.827
So, where's Earl on appeals?

04:48.861 --> 04:50.195
They've all been exhausted.

04:50.229 --> 04:51.830
Habeas petition has been denied, too.

04:51.864 --> 04:53.832
If Earl killed Tom,
there's nothing we can do.

04:53.866 --> 04:56.134
If he didn't,
we have to stop the execution.

04:56.168 --> 04:57.413
Tom handled some rough cases.

04:57.438 --> 05:00.705
Look at his work file, see who he
prosecuted or was prosecuting.

05:00.740 --> 05:02.307
Check the files his wife brought in.

05:02.341 --> 05:04.776
I'll talk to the A.U.S.A.
who put Earl on death row.

05:04.810 --> 05:06.580
He should be arriving
at my office any minute.

05:06.605 --> 05:08.013
We'll talk to him together.

05:08.047 --> 05:09.781
Lucky me.

05:14.987 --> 05:17.179
Earl Slavitt shot and killed Tom.

05:17.390 --> 05:18.664
No doubts?

05:18.812 --> 05:20.912
None at all. I knew the evidence
inside and out.

05:20.937 --> 05:22.794
Had that case won at opening argument.

05:22.828 --> 05:24.396
Someone's a little full of themselves.

05:24.430 --> 05:26.464
Well, it's not bragging
if you can back it up,

05:26.499 --> 05:30.367
and I owe it all to Tom Simon.
He was a great mentor and friend.

05:30.392 --> 05:32.806
After he was shot, we were
neighbors on the Upper East Side.

05:32.831 --> 05:34.205
Tom was a good man.

05:34.240 --> 05:35.874
We'll still need your files.

05:35.908 --> 05:37.323
Sure, and while you're at it,

05:37.348 --> 05:39.597
get the files from
the three federally required

05:39.622 --> 05:41.557
post-conviction death-penalty
appellate lawyers

05:41.582 --> 05:43.915
and their investigators
who reviewed, re-reviewed,

05:43.950 --> 05:47.132
and re-re-reviewed Earl's case.

05:48.754 --> 05:50.522
You're wasting your time and mine.

05:50.556 --> 05:52.157
Bill, come on.

05:52.191 --> 05:54.059
Tom didn't believe in the death penalty.

05:54.093 --> 05:56.428
He would've wanted us
to make sure Earl was guilty.

05:56.462 --> 05:57.896
We owe him that.

06:03.269 --> 06:04.402
Talk to me.

06:04.437 --> 06:07.405
Hey, we found unopened mail
in the files from Tom's wife.

06:07.440 --> 06:09.341
Mostly condolence letters.

06:09.375 --> 06:11.809
She probably didn't have the heart
to open them after he died.

06:11.834 --> 06:13.912
But one of the letters was
typewritten, unsigned,

06:13.946 --> 06:15.847
no return address, no postmark.

06:15.881 --> 06:17.382
Writer confessed to shooting Tom.

06:17.416 --> 06:19.851
Plenty of wackos want to take credit
for other people's crimes.

06:19.885 --> 06:20.885
Not this wacko.

06:20.920 --> 06:23.088
He had details that weren't
released to the press.

06:23.122 --> 06:24.389
Right, like the ghost gun.

06:24.423 --> 06:26.391
Bragged that he bought
an unfinished receiver

06:26.425 --> 06:28.026
and built it himself at home.

06:28.060 --> 06:29.642
Said he was good at not getting caught.

06:29.667 --> 06:31.463
Sent the letter
just to clear his conscience.

06:31.497 --> 06:34.466
Dust for prints, swab for DNA,
test the ink, the paper, whatever.

06:34.500 --> 06:36.201
We have to find out who wrote it.

06:37.750 --> 06:40.772
Right. If there's nothing else,
I got to catch a plane to Indiana.

06:40.806 --> 06:42.540
Fly safe. We'll see you there.

06:42.575 --> 06:44.612
You're gonna watch the execution?

06:45.494 --> 06:47.261
No, I'm gonna stop it.

06:52.873 --> 06:54.672
_

07:00.117 --> 07:01.914
I told Earl you were coming.

07:02.041 --> 07:03.174
What do you think of him?

07:03.560 --> 07:04.551
He's a nice guy.

07:04.576 --> 07:07.537
He thinks Earl's guilty.
Wants to know where you stand.

07:08.201 --> 07:11.549
I've been superintendent here
going on eight years.

07:11.583 --> 07:15.353
Most inmates on death row are
loners, don't mix well.

07:15.387 --> 07:17.088
Earl's different.

07:17.122 --> 07:18.156
He's friendly.

07:18.190 --> 07:21.065
Take away his prison jumpsuit,
you might mistake him for one of us.

07:21.366 --> 07:23.120
Not likely.

07:23.762 --> 07:25.763
We have him on 24/7 suicide watch.

07:25.788 --> 07:28.790
Because why not keep a man alive
so you can kill him?

07:30.202 --> 07:32.947
I don't like all aspects
of my job, Ms. Morrison.

07:33.556 --> 07:34.990
But I do it by the book.

07:36.775 --> 07:38.124
I'll take you to him now.

07:38.610 --> 07:43.081
I've been here seven years,
three months, and nine days

07:43.358 --> 07:44.999
for something I didn't do.

07:45.085 --> 07:47.220
Evidence says otherwise.

07:47.793 --> 07:49.928
You think I'm a killer, too?

07:49.955 --> 07:52.790
- Mr. Slavitt, we...
- Earl, please.

07:52.825 --> 07:56.194
Earl, we found a letter
confessing to the shooting.

07:56.228 --> 07:58.563
It was sent to Tom Simon's address.

08:01.900 --> 08:03.532
I knew it.

08:04.525 --> 08:07.294
I knew if I held on long enough,
someone would help me.

08:07.319 --> 08:08.606
Thank you, Ms. Morrison.

08:08.640 --> 08:09.974
Hayes, please.

08:10.467 --> 08:13.377
But there are no guarantees.
Right now we have no idea who wrote it.

08:13.412 --> 08:18.107
For all we know, you did
in an attempt to save your ass.

08:18.517 --> 08:20.351
She gives hope, you take it away.

08:20.385 --> 08:22.386
You threatened Tom Simon.

08:22.421 --> 08:24.088
You carried through on that threat.

08:24.122 --> 08:26.741
If you're so sure of that,
why are you here?

08:27.960 --> 08:30.538
A man's death
shouldn't be taken lightly.

08:30.639 --> 08:32.273
Not even yours.

08:32.464 --> 08:34.097
Wallace and Tom were close.

08:34.131 --> 08:35.836
That's okay...

08:36.134 --> 08:37.727
Hayes.

08:39.136 --> 08:41.038
Being on death row, I've gotten used to

08:41.073 --> 08:43.227
people thinking I'm something I'm not.

08:44.275 --> 08:45.943
You want someone to suffer

08:46.089 --> 08:47.634
for what happened to your friend.

08:47.659 --> 08:48.946
Yes.

08:48.981 --> 08:50.882
He was murdered.

08:50.916 --> 08:52.846
Not by me.

08:53.285 --> 08:55.159
You'll see.

08:55.454 --> 08:57.255
Not by me.

08:58.891 --> 09:00.524
You believe me?

09:00.559 --> 09:02.526
I want to.

09:02.561 --> 09:04.297
Help me prove it.

09:09.434 --> 09:10.967
- He's playing us.
- I don't think so.

09:10.992 --> 09:13.908
We need to buy some time to
find out what really happened.

09:14.973 --> 09:17.173
Your Honor, I'm requesting
a stay of execution

09:17.198 --> 09:18.653
in Mr. Slavitt's case on the grounds

09:18.678 --> 09:20.978
that new exculpatory evidence
has been found.

09:21.013 --> 09:23.581
A typed, unsigned letter
with no return address

09:23.615 --> 09:25.416
doesn't fall within
the realm of admissible,

09:25.450 --> 09:27.585
much less clear and compelling evidence.

09:27.619 --> 09:29.120
- May it please the court...
- Tess.

09:29.154 --> 09:30.888
...Justice Breyer stated
in Glossip v. Gross

09:30.923 --> 09:32.990
the death penalty violates
the Eighth Amendment.

09:33.402 --> 09:36.294
Bring your little sister to fight
your battles for you, Mr. Spencer?

09:36.328 --> 09:37.995
Actually, I graduated
top of my law-school class,

09:38.030 --> 09:39.807
was editor-in-chief
of the criminal law journal.

09:39.832 --> 09:42.099
Breyer argues capital punishment
is unreliable,

09:42.134 --> 09:45.110
arbitrarily imposed, subject
to unconscionably long delays,

09:45.135 --> 09:46.929
- as well as...
- Impressive memory, young lady,

09:46.954 --> 09:50.007
but Justice Breyer's comments
were part of his dissenting opinion,

09:50.042 --> 09:52.109
and as such, have no binding authority.

09:52.144 --> 09:53.544
Doesn't mean he wasn't right.

09:58.014 --> 09:59.984
You haven't brought me proof
of innocence.

10:00.018 --> 10:01.585
And until you do, your petition to file

10:01.610 --> 10:04.268
a second Writ of Habeas Corpus
is denied.

10:05.490 --> 10:07.425
The execution will proceed as planned.

10:11.131 --> 10:13.676
Nice try, Sam.
Now we just need to find the proof.

10:13.700 --> 10:16.045
- Get you back in front of the judge.
- Losing sucks, huh?

10:16.079 --> 10:18.063
I got to go. Excuse me?

10:18.503 --> 10:20.171
A second habeas petition?

10:20.205 --> 10:23.019
Even with that socalled confession
letter, it took balls to try that.

10:23.044 --> 10:24.472
Well, someone's got to have them.

10:24.497 --> 10:27.245
Well, like I told you, there were
no errors made during the trial.

10:27.270 --> 10:29.413
- You're on a fishing expedition.
- Ease up, Bill.

10:29.448 --> 10:32.850
I win more cases than any other
A.U.S.A. in New York.

10:32.884 --> 10:34.495
It's a noble thing you're trying to do,

10:34.520 --> 10:36.454
but you're not gonna save this guy.

10:36.488 --> 10:37.955
We'll see about that.

10:37.990 --> 10:40.764
We need a copy
of the execution briefing sheet.

10:40.789 --> 10:42.866
Got to love New Yorkers.
Knocking's a formality.

10:42.891 --> 10:44.350
You said for me to make myself at home.

10:44.375 --> 10:46.163
- No, I didn't.
- You would've if I knocked.

10:46.198 --> 10:47.531
I need a briefing sheet.

10:47.566 --> 10:49.500
I also need Earl's
designation of witnesses.

10:49.534 --> 10:51.372
You're required
to have reviewed them with him

10:51.397 --> 10:53.078
at least 30 days before the execution.

10:53.105 --> 10:55.911
I did. 33 days prior.

10:55.936 --> 10:57.141
Disposition of his body?

10:57.175 --> 10:59.143
Earl chose to be cremated.

10:59.177 --> 11:00.847
You did this at least 14 days prior...

11:00.872 --> 11:02.580
19 days, to be exact.

11:02.614 --> 11:05.082
Spiritual advisor
chosen 16 days prior...

11:05.117 --> 11:06.646
Roman Catholic priest.

11:06.671 --> 11:08.272
Personnel to assist in the execution?

11:08.297 --> 11:09.387
Selected.

11:09.421 --> 11:11.913
And we have practiced every step
of the execution process.

11:11.938 --> 11:13.557
Well, not every step.

11:13.592 --> 11:15.026
Not funny.

11:15.060 --> 11:16.994
- Gallows humor.
- Literally.

11:17.029 --> 11:17.995
Also not funny.

11:18.030 --> 11:20.107
Either you laugh or you cry.

11:20.132 --> 11:21.532
What have you been doing?

11:21.566 --> 11:23.025
Not laughing.

11:24.182 --> 11:27.104
Between days 13 and 7,
Earl chose his last meal...

11:27.139 --> 11:29.336
extra lean corn beef on rye

11:29.361 --> 11:31.208
from Mel's Avenue Deli in New York.

11:31.243 --> 11:33.955
Corn chips and cream soda.

11:34.413 --> 11:36.380
I've done this before.

11:36.415 --> 11:38.531
I know that if I made even one mistake,

11:38.556 --> 11:40.468
missed a deadline by even an hour,

11:40.493 --> 11:43.721
then the entire month of prep stops
and starts all over again.

11:43.755 --> 11:45.806
Then make a mistake.

11:45.957 --> 11:48.547
Give me more time to get to the truth.

11:49.031 --> 11:51.023
You hate this part of your job.

12:03.175 --> 12:06.921
Each step of the preexecution process
has been followed as required by law.

12:08.917 --> 12:10.537
You'll see.

12:12.184 --> 12:13.588
Copy machine's down the hall.

12:28.295 --> 12:29.600
My room smells.

12:29.625 --> 12:31.261
- Complain to the manager.
- I did.

12:31.286 --> 12:34.572
He laughed in my face, and he told
me this place is totally booked.

12:36.541 --> 12:38.209
We're switching rooms.

12:40.479 --> 12:42.155
Fine.

12:42.447 --> 12:44.108
No argument?

12:44.349 --> 12:46.450
You took Tom's case. I owe you.

12:46.485 --> 12:47.893
Thank you.

12:48.227 --> 12:49.760
I still loathe you for lying to me.

12:49.788 --> 12:53.165
And I still find you abrasive,
unforgiving,

12:53.190 --> 12:56.093
and completely unsuitable
for a long-term adult relationship.

12:56.118 --> 12:57.585
Glad we're on the same page.

13:08.445 --> 13:09.612
What's going on, Frankie?

13:09.637 --> 13:11.542
We got DNA results
on the confession letter.

13:11.576 --> 13:14.011
Traced it back to an ex-con
named Harold Redding.

13:14.036 --> 13:16.280
He's a local thug for hire
with a long sheet.

13:16.314 --> 13:18.549
- Basically a hitman.
- Ghost gun makes sense now.

13:18.583 --> 13:20.489
Track him down.
Find out who he was working for.

13:20.514 --> 13:22.987
We can't. Harold died of...

13:24.389 --> 13:26.466
...pancreatic cancer two years ago,

13:26.491 --> 13:27.625
but we're checking his financials

13:27.659 --> 13:29.126
to see who might've paid him
for the hit.

13:29.161 --> 13:31.419
And Sam and Maxine are checking
for connections he might've had

13:31.444 --> 13:33.230
to defendants in Tom's other cases.

13:33.265 --> 13:34.698
Maxine just called
from the Bureau of Prisons.

13:34.733 --> 13:37.701
Earl and Harold were
at Allenwood at the same time.

13:37.736 --> 13:39.336
They were released
within days of each other.

13:39.371 --> 13:41.539
Doesn't mean Earl hired him to kill Tom.

13:41.573 --> 13:43.307
But it sure looks like he did.

13:51.043 --> 13:52.637
_

13:52.747 --> 13:54.247
Two days until the election,

13:54.272 --> 13:55.759
and polls are indicating

13:55.784 --> 13:58.085
Harper Morrison has a 12-point lead

13:58.110 --> 13:59.987
over her nearest competitors.

14:00.021 --> 14:02.410
Her stance on criminal-justice reform...

14:02.435 --> 14:04.740
Do you have any more of those
little cans of almonds?

14:04.881 --> 14:07.082
Does the concept
of privacy mean nothing to you?

14:07.107 --> 14:09.123
Oh, relax. I've seen you
wearing a lot less.

14:09.148 --> 14:11.241
Mmm, someone's been doing his P90X.

14:11.266 --> 14:13.166
Just because we're neighbors
does not mean

14:13.201 --> 14:15.335
you can barge in here any time you want.

14:15.370 --> 14:17.337
Why? Naomi wouldn't approve?

14:17.372 --> 14:18.590
Naomi knows better than to worry.

14:18.615 --> 14:21.008
Mm. So, things are good with her?

14:21.042 --> 14:22.342
Yeah. Really good.

14:22.367 --> 14:24.725
...too great a margin for her
competitors to overcome.

14:24.750 --> 14:26.380
Polls look like your mom
is gonna pull this out.

14:26.414 --> 14:27.404
Mm, what a relief.

14:27.429 --> 14:29.483
Now she can't blame me
for costing her the election.

14:29.517 --> 14:32.247
Come on. If anything, you've helped.

14:32.420 --> 14:35.653
The work you're doing
at the CIU, people have noticed.

14:38.126 --> 14:40.818
Naomi transferred to her firm's
New York office.

14:42.539 --> 14:43.802
Great.

14:44.532 --> 14:45.932
I'm gonna go and ask Earl

14:45.967 --> 14:48.268
whether he hired
his prison buddy hit man Harold.

14:48.303 --> 14:50.570
Let me finish getting dressed.
I'll come with.

14:50.605 --> 14:51.847
Better if it's just me.

14:51.872 --> 14:54.685
Easier to get him to open up
without you antagonizing him.

14:59.405 --> 15:01.600
Harold Redding was
at Allenwood with you.

15:01.625 --> 15:03.998
His cellblock was
100 yards away from yours.

15:04.953 --> 15:08.438
Might as well be 100 miles.
Cellblocks don't mix.

15:08.957 --> 15:11.656
Did you hire him to kill Tom?

15:12.649 --> 15:14.895
You siding with D.A. Wallace now?

15:14.929 --> 15:19.238
I ditched him...
so we could talk, just us.

15:20.368 --> 15:22.355
You holding up okay?

15:24.143 --> 15:25.994
I appreciate the visit.

15:26.432 --> 15:28.242
But I'm not interested in your pity,

15:28.432 --> 15:30.479
even if I am on my way out.

15:31.049 --> 15:35.044
I don't do pity,
and you're not going anywhere.

15:35.825 --> 15:39.263
If I hired a hit man, I'd tell you.

15:39.536 --> 15:41.288
What have I got to lose?

15:41.419 --> 15:43.153
Me, for starters.

15:43.278 --> 15:45.244
I don't do guilty, either.

15:46.361 --> 15:50.892
All I've got to take to my grave
is my integrity.

15:51.800 --> 15:56.478
I didn't hire anyone to shoot Tom Simon.

15:56.738 --> 16:00.228
If I could turn back time,
if I could find a way...

16:00.486 --> 16:02.955
You would do a Cher impersonation?

16:06.363 --> 16:08.683
That song has been stuck
in my head lately.

16:08.866 --> 16:10.893
I've had "Girls Just Want to Have Fun"

16:10.918 --> 16:13.954
pinging in my brain
for the last 30 years.

16:17.025 --> 16:20.368
Thinking maybe I ought to listen
to "Stairway to Heaven" soon.

16:21.571 --> 16:22.996
You believe in it?

16:23.157 --> 16:24.498
Heaven?

16:24.649 --> 16:26.333
Don't lie to me, please.

16:29.370 --> 16:32.502
Okay. Um, I don't.

16:32.931 --> 16:36.283
I think that when we die,
we're worm food.

16:37.879 --> 16:40.660
- I hope you're wrong, though.
- Me, too.

16:40.849 --> 16:44.035
You think that's where
you're headed... Heaven?

16:44.919 --> 16:46.320
I'm hoping, yep.

16:46.410 --> 16:48.021
Mm.

16:49.891 --> 16:52.439
I didn't shoot Tom Simon.

16:53.394 --> 16:56.096
You can believe I'm innocent.

16:57.565 --> 17:00.225
I just need to prove
you didn't pay Harold.

17:04.156 --> 17:05.957
Any chance your financial records

17:05.982 --> 17:09.193
are still kicking around
from before Tom was murdered?

17:09.444 --> 17:12.839
Oh. It's been a long time.

17:13.882 --> 17:15.856
But my ex-wife might have them.

17:16.951 --> 17:20.440
She divorced me when I was
convicted of the murder charge.

17:22.013 --> 17:24.540
I haven't seen her or my son...

17:25.993 --> 17:27.550
Dean...

17:28.128 --> 17:30.625
for 10 years now.

17:32.834 --> 17:35.187
I still write to him every week, though.

17:36.404 --> 17:38.327
But, you know...

17:40.408 --> 17:42.960
Just find a way out for me, okay?

17:44.812 --> 17:47.981
You're welcome to my
ex-husband's financial records.

17:48.016 --> 17:49.456
They're in the Fresh Kills Landfill.

17:49.484 --> 17:50.784
They all went to the dump.

17:50.818 --> 17:52.886
What do you need them for, anyway?

17:52.921 --> 17:56.323
We discovered evidence suggesting
that a hitman killed Tom Simon.

17:56.357 --> 17:58.559
So you're trying to prove
that Earl hired him?

17:58.593 --> 18:00.160
Or someone else did.

18:00.195 --> 18:01.895
Tom Simon is all that Earl
ever talked about

18:01.930 --> 18:04.064
when he was in prison
for the fraud conviction.

18:04.098 --> 18:05.715
He was obsessed with revenge.

18:05.740 --> 18:07.935
Leave us alone. We don't want
anything to do with him.

18:07.969 --> 18:10.571
Your father's getting executed
in two days.

18:10.605 --> 18:12.139
Maybe a little forgiveness is in order.

18:12.173 --> 18:14.274
He doesn't deserve to be forgiven.

18:17.551 --> 18:19.676
Earl was a lousy husband.

18:19.965 --> 18:22.409
He cheated on me with that
bimbo, Nina, from the office.

18:22.434 --> 18:24.318
But I stood by him the whole trial.

18:24.352 --> 18:26.496
We mortgaged the house
to pay for his legal bills.

18:26.746 --> 18:28.322
He bankrupted this family.

18:28.356 --> 18:30.074
He left us homeless.

18:30.324 --> 18:32.317
His passing is no loss to us.

18:36.531 --> 18:38.498
I think I remember a female CPA

18:38.523 --> 18:41.134
from the list of employees
at Earl's work... Nina Chen.

18:41.169 --> 18:43.615
She was an accountant.
Maybe she was involved in the fraud.

18:43.640 --> 18:46.265
Or maybe she contracted the hitman.
Let's track her down.

18:46.290 --> 18:49.554
So far, no luck finding payments
from Earl to Harold Redding.

18:49.579 --> 18:51.575
But we are getting
Harold's old financial records

18:51.600 --> 18:53.301
from archives. We got lucky.

18:53.326 --> 18:54.801
Bank never got around
to destroying them.

18:54.826 --> 18:57.575
Hopefully, there'll be deposits
around the time Tom Simon was shot.

18:57.600 --> 18:59.453
We're thinking we find those,
we find who paid him.

18:59.487 --> 19:00.988
Look for deposits from Nina Chen.

19:01.022 --> 19:02.356
She was an accountant
that worked with Earl.

19:02.390 --> 19:03.610
They were close,
maybe a little too close.

19:03.635 --> 19:06.526
In the meantime, let's track down Nina,
see what she has to say.

19:06.561 --> 19:08.528
All right, I'll meet you
in your office in a minute.

19:31.953 --> 19:33.447
I tracked down Nina Chen.

19:33.472 --> 19:35.088
She's an accountant
that worked at Earl's firm.

19:35.123 --> 19:37.478
Now, she doesn't think that Earl
committed fraud in the first place.

19:37.503 --> 19:38.752
Why does that even matter?

19:38.777 --> 19:40.093
We're not investigating the fraud case.

19:40.128 --> 19:41.395
Well, maybe we should be.

19:41.429 --> 19:43.090
Nina told me that
there's an internal memo

19:43.115 --> 19:45.051
that proves that the person
who actually committed fraud

19:45.076 --> 19:46.958
is Earl's boss, Sean Rasmullen.

19:46.983 --> 19:48.974
No memo like that
was introduced at trial.

19:48.999 --> 19:50.505
Probably because it didn't exist.

19:50.530 --> 19:52.613
There's no proof that memo
wasn't just made up.

19:52.638 --> 19:55.279
As a matter of fact, there is.
Nina kept a copy.

19:55.716 --> 19:57.505
Why didn't she turn it over as evidence?

19:57.648 --> 19:59.935
She did. She said
she gave it to Tom Simon.

20:01.215 --> 20:04.084
I second chaired Earl Slavitt's
fraud trial with Tom.

20:04.118 --> 20:06.004
I'm familiar with the case.
I've never seen this before.

20:06.029 --> 20:08.191
Nina Chen swears she gave it to Tom.

20:08.216 --> 20:10.168
How do you explain him not
turning it over to the defense?

20:10.193 --> 20:11.625
I can't. We gave them everything we had.

20:11.659 --> 20:14.061
Nina has no motivation to lie.

20:14.095 --> 20:15.944
Tom Simon withheld evidence.

20:15.969 --> 20:17.170
That's ridiculous.

20:17.194 --> 20:19.447
For all we know,
Earl wrote it to cover his tracks.

20:19.472 --> 20:21.702
Tell her. Tom would never
withhold evidence.

20:21.736 --> 20:24.197
I never saw him do anything
to suggest he was compromised.

20:24.222 --> 20:26.081
You never saw him?

20:26.407 --> 20:27.837
That's not a ringing endorsement.

20:27.862 --> 20:29.776
- Tom was a good man.
- That's not an answer.

20:29.801 --> 20:32.746
- Hayes, that's enough.
- You didn't see anything.

20:33.051 --> 20:35.515
Tom was beyond reproach.

20:37.618 --> 20:38.885
People talked.

20:38.919 --> 20:41.668
Tom had it pretty good. Lived in
a big house, drove a fancy car.

20:41.693 --> 20:43.262
- He invested well.
- People talked about

20:43.287 --> 20:44.855
how he could afford
that kind of lifestyle.

20:44.856 --> 20:47.938
Are you saying that Tom was
fixing cases for money?

20:49.560 --> 20:51.775
I didn't want to drag his name
through the mud.

20:51.800 --> 20:52.963
He was my friend.

20:52.997 --> 20:55.198
He took a bribe from Sean Rasmullen

20:55.233 --> 20:56.820
to pin the fraud on Earl?

20:56.845 --> 20:57.763
I didn't know that,

20:57.788 --> 20:59.269
and this has nothing to do with
the murder case.

20:59.303 --> 21:01.163
If Tom was fixing cases,

21:01.188 --> 21:03.187
this opens up a whole new
avenue of suspects

21:03.212 --> 21:05.462
in the shooting that you ignored.

21:05.931 --> 21:07.336
Congratulations, Bill.

21:07.361 --> 21:09.458
You may have put an innocent man
on death row.

21:18.311 --> 21:20.007
_

21:20.913 --> 21:23.588
Your Honor, we have proof
that A.U.S.A. Tom Simon

21:23.622 --> 21:24.923
hid exculpatory evidence

21:24.957 --> 21:27.192
and was very likely
on the payroll of criminals.

21:27.218 --> 21:30.187
We even have an A.U.S.A. who
confirmed rumors to this effect

21:30.229 --> 21:31.362
and is willing to testify.

21:31.397 --> 21:33.531
I know how to argue the merits
of the petition, Hayes.

21:33.566 --> 21:36.467
Emphasize that you did
exactly what was asked.

21:36.502 --> 21:38.248
You brought in proof of innocence.

21:38.270 --> 21:40.871
- First show her the memo.
- Copy that. Can I go now?

21:40.896 --> 21:43.374
Say that the memo shows
that Earl's boss,

21:43.399 --> 21:45.778
Sean Rasmullen,
was embezzling, not Earl.

21:45.803 --> 21:46.973
Hayes, he knows what to do.

21:46.998 --> 21:48.742
And if the judge doesn't want
to discuss the merits

21:48.767 --> 21:50.273
of Earl's fraud conviction, then...

21:50.298 --> 21:51.449
I'll argue that the fraud case is

21:51.484 --> 21:53.885
what the prosecution built the
murder case against Mr. Slavitt on.

21:53.919 --> 21:56.421
- Then tell her...
- Sam, just tell the judge

21:56.455 --> 21:59.290
there were rumors Tom was taking bribes
to fix cases for criminals.

21:59.325 --> 22:01.672
- Ergo...
- That's fancy for "therefore."

22:01.697 --> 22:03.789
Therefore, lots of people,

22:03.814 --> 22:07.265
unsavory people besides Earl,
might've wanted Tom dead.

22:07.299 --> 22:09.701
Who could've hired Harold Redding
to kill him. I got it. I got it.

22:09.735 --> 22:10.998
Even if the rumors are unconfirmed,

22:11.023 --> 22:13.304
if there's the smallest risk
that an innocent man

22:13.329 --> 22:15.206
is gonna be exe...

22:15.346 --> 22:16.352
He hung up on me.

22:16.377 --> 22:18.877
Because you're bossy
and obnoxious and rude.

22:18.911 --> 22:20.311
Flatterer.

22:20.346 --> 22:22.361
I am also right. Earl is innocent.

22:22.386 --> 22:23.515
Not necessarily.

22:23.549 --> 22:26.330
The memo might or might not have
been given to Tom.

22:26.355 --> 22:28.625
The hit man might or might not
have been hired by Earl.

22:28.650 --> 22:30.690
You were just helping me argue
for the stay of execution.

22:30.715 --> 22:32.801
He's not necessarily guilty, either.

22:35.461 --> 22:37.815
Sucks, doesn't it?

22:38.330 --> 22:41.800
Finding out somebody you cared about
wasn't the person you thought they were.

22:42.073 --> 22:45.190
Are you talking to me or about me?

22:47.673 --> 22:48.951
First year of law school,

22:48.976 --> 22:51.781
Tom and I were seated
next to each other in civ pro.

22:52.007 --> 22:54.312
We were friends ever since.

22:56.101 --> 22:57.648
I thought I knew him.

22:58.447 --> 23:01.156
Reconsidering your stance
on the death penalty?

23:04.523 --> 23:07.826
Let's just hope the judge comes
through with a stay for Earl.

23:12.704 --> 23:14.711
- Flight okay?
- Fine.

23:15.211 --> 23:18.336
But I'm guessing you didn't
ask me here to discuss my travels.

23:18.370 --> 23:21.560
Susan, were you and Tom okay
with money before he was shot?

23:23.013 --> 23:25.979
We had a comfortable life,
no problems paying our bills.

23:26.004 --> 23:27.555
Why are you asking?

23:27.580 --> 23:31.516
This is hard,
but I have reason to suspect

23:31.550 --> 23:34.240
Tom was taking bribes to fix cases,

23:34.265 --> 23:37.622
and may have been killed by someone
who wanted to cover things up.

23:40.693 --> 23:42.929
Tom treated you like a brother.

23:43.495 --> 23:45.843
You asked me to look into this case.

23:46.265 --> 23:48.800
You wanted to be sure
an innocent man wasn't executed.

23:48.834 --> 23:50.939
A man's life is at stake.

23:51.904 --> 23:54.305
I believe in Tom, and I'll do
everything in my power

23:54.340 --> 23:57.126
to protect his reputation,
but in order to do that,

23:57.412 --> 23:59.798
I need to know the truth,
and I don't have much time.

24:00.267 --> 24:02.633
I need access to your banking records.

24:03.382 --> 24:04.962
Will you help me?

24:09.555 --> 24:12.724
Susan gave us all
of Tom's accounts and passwords.

24:12.758 --> 24:15.226
I was hoping to find
unusual deposits or withdraws

24:15.261 --> 24:18.329
around the time of Earl's fraud
case, but so far nothing.

24:18.364 --> 24:20.698
If he was on the take,
maybe he had a private account,

24:20.733 --> 24:22.253
something his wife didn't know about.

24:22.278 --> 24:25.770
I did find something interesting
in hit man Harold's financials.

24:25.804 --> 24:29.264
There was a total of almost
$38,000 worth of deposits

24:29.289 --> 24:32.075
into Harold's account
around the time Tom was shot,

24:32.110 --> 24:35.356
and each of those deposits was
just under $2,000.

24:35.381 --> 24:37.415
But that's 19 different checks.

24:37.449 --> 24:39.295
Not checks... money orders.

24:39.320 --> 24:42.796
Money orders are anonymous
if the amount is below $2,000.

24:42.821 --> 24:45.798
Above that, a suspicious
activity report would've been filed.

24:45.823 --> 24:49.354
Whoever hired Harold to kill Tom
did a hell of a job covering his tracks.

24:49.379 --> 24:51.396
I requested the serial numbers
of the money orders,

24:51.430 --> 24:53.728
which should help us figure out
where they were purchased

24:53.753 --> 24:56.399
and maybe even who purchased them.

25:00.316 --> 25:01.482
Maxine.

25:01.507 --> 25:03.608
Been a ghost around here lately.
Where you been?

25:03.642 --> 25:06.477
Just trying to track down
Earl's boss, Sean Rasmullen.

25:06.512 --> 25:07.946
Hasn't been easy. That guy's slippery.

25:07.980 --> 25:09.338
Most financial guys are.

25:09.363 --> 25:10.882
Yeah.

25:12.017 --> 25:14.836
I'm gonna say something
that might piss you off.

25:18.857 --> 25:22.352
Lately you've seemed
a little off, showing up late.

25:22.418 --> 25:23.561
I told you I had a meeting.

25:23.596 --> 25:25.230
Reminds me of how you were.

25:25.264 --> 25:27.197
You know, right before you retired.

25:27.767 --> 25:29.434
You having trouble again?

25:29.468 --> 25:31.790
All of that is behind me.

25:32.338 --> 25:33.962
I swear.

25:34.556 --> 25:36.118
Okay.

25:37.016 --> 25:39.634
Hey, any news about the stay?

25:40.122 --> 25:41.344
No.

25:46.524 --> 25:48.733
Hurricane Mindy is set to make landfall

25:48.758 --> 25:51.838
tomorrow in Florida
with expected rainfall

25:51.863 --> 25:53.762
of two to three inches per hour

25:53.786 --> 25:55.488
in hardest-hit areas.

25:55.629 --> 25:57.980
- Officials plan to open polling places...
- Yeah.

25:58.005 --> 26:02.243
...early to beat out the storm in
Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina.

26:02.268 --> 26:03.555
- Okay, got it.
- And in New York,

26:03.580 --> 26:06.681
latest polls show
Harper Morrison in the lead.

26:06.797 --> 26:08.033
That...

26:10.809 --> 26:13.239
Wallace! Sam just called.

26:13.912 --> 26:15.598
- Yeah?
- You were right about Tom.

26:15.623 --> 26:17.682
No suspect deposits made
into his account.

26:17.716 --> 26:19.484
Good. I knew there wouldn't be.

26:19.518 --> 26:22.592
And the judge granted a stay. We did it.

26:22.712 --> 26:24.599
We got Earl a reprieve.

26:24.633 --> 26:26.691
We have time
to figure out the truth now.

26:26.725 --> 26:28.169
- We did it.
- We did!

26:28.194 --> 26:30.262
You and me! We're awesome!

26:32.064 --> 26:33.698
Yes, we are.

26:41.874 --> 26:43.790
Why aren't we really?

26:46.745 --> 26:48.282
I don't know.

26:48.976 --> 26:50.618
I really don't.

26:52.551 --> 26:55.453
I'm too impulsive,
you're too calculated.

26:55.850 --> 26:57.731
- One issue.
- Among many.

27:02.368 --> 27:05.303
Sounds like things are getting serious
between you and Naomi.

27:05.346 --> 27:06.788
Yeah.

27:07.082 --> 27:09.183
Big step, her moving to New York.

27:10.602 --> 27:12.429
You worried about it?

27:13.810 --> 27:16.943
She says she's not
just doing it for me, but...

27:17.646 --> 27:18.958
I don't know.

27:19.060 --> 27:21.248
It's hard not to feel some pressure.

27:22.481 --> 27:26.074
Look, Naomi's great.

27:27.383 --> 27:29.168
She's absurdly hot...

27:30.098 --> 27:31.512
smart...

27:32.758 --> 27:35.313
probably better for you than I was.

27:37.096 --> 27:38.797
You should give it a shot.

27:43.569 --> 27:45.170
Does it freak you out?

27:46.138 --> 27:50.435
The idea of committing
to someone, settling down?

27:51.643 --> 27:54.130
I know it used to, but what about now?

27:59.303 --> 28:01.349
Depends on the person, I guess.

28:05.824 --> 28:07.106
Hayes.

28:07.276 --> 28:09.161
See you in the morning, Wallace.

28:40.592 --> 28:42.657
Not gonna happen.

28:43.162 --> 28:45.353
Bill Newton appealed the stay.

28:45.455 --> 28:46.922
He's such a douche.

28:46.963 --> 28:49.648
Any other prosecutor
would've done the same thing.

28:50.870 --> 28:52.537
The Supreme Court just ruled.

28:52.562 --> 28:53.863
No, please.

28:53.888 --> 28:55.357
They lifted the stay of execution.

28:55.382 --> 28:57.107
We don't know if he's guilty.
We need more time.

28:57.132 --> 28:58.804
We don't have any more.

28:59.011 --> 29:01.073
Earl's going to be executed...

29:01.768 --> 29:03.159
tonight.

29:10.151 --> 29:12.393
You had to appeal it to the Supremes?

29:12.628 --> 29:14.998
Couldn't risk
your winning record, could you?

29:15.023 --> 29:17.319
- That's how the game's played.
- I'm reporting you to DOJ

29:17.344 --> 29:19.493
for breaching the canons
of professional ethics.

29:19.527 --> 29:22.496
Rumors of corruption
do not equal knowledge thereof.

29:22.530 --> 29:24.298
I'll be cleared of all wrongdoing,

29:24.332 --> 29:26.318
and it'll be another win for me.

29:31.028 --> 29:32.659
What about Earl's last meal?

29:32.684 --> 29:35.575
Extra lean corn beef on rye
and corn chips. Ready and waiting.

29:35.600 --> 29:37.344
If it's not from Mel's
Avenue Deli in Manhattan...

29:37.379 --> 29:38.542
They FedEx'd it here this morning.

29:38.567 --> 29:40.948
We've been through this.
I followed the protocol.

29:40.982 --> 29:42.368
- What about...
- No, I know you think you've got

29:42.393 --> 29:43.693
some evidence that Earl may be innocent.

29:43.718 --> 29:46.656
- Earl is innocent. I-I just... I...
- Look, I see what you're trying to do.

29:46.955 --> 29:49.429
And I admire it. Truly, I do.

29:50.258 --> 29:51.534
I'm afraid Earl's
at the end of the line.

29:51.559 --> 29:53.277
This is so wrong!

29:53.302 --> 29:56.121
Someone has to deliver
the people's will.

29:56.298 --> 29:57.452
That someone is me.

29:57.477 --> 29:59.233
And most of the time, when you have,

29:59.267 --> 30:01.468
it's been, if not right, then righteous.
In this case, it is not.

30:01.503 --> 30:02.915
It's never right...

30:03.238 --> 30:04.298
or righteous.

30:08.143 --> 30:10.706
Do you know that I am the only one here

30:10.979 --> 30:13.894
who doesn't have a choice about
participating in executions?

30:17.519 --> 30:20.105
Earl is gonna have his last meal.

30:20.455 --> 30:22.113
He'll meet with the priest.

30:22.282 --> 30:24.533
He'll be given an opportunity
to say any last words.

30:24.558 --> 30:26.234
And in just over two hours...

30:27.113 --> 30:29.034
we're gonna kill him.

30:29.497 --> 30:32.131
So if you want to save him,
you better do it quick.

30:34.102 --> 30:35.952
Tess, you have an hour and 54 minutes

30:35.977 --> 30:37.708
to find out who hired Harold
to kill Tom.

30:37.733 --> 30:40.274
- I'm close on tracking that.
- Close won't save Earl's life.

30:40.308 --> 30:42.009
I'm diving back in now.

30:42.302 --> 30:44.045
What'd you get on Sean?

30:44.346 --> 30:46.480
Rasmullen? Earl's boss?

30:46.514 --> 30:48.782
The guy that we think
might've bribed Tom Simon.

30:48.817 --> 30:50.484
Killed him to protect his own ass.

30:50.518 --> 30:51.980
Sean's lawyers put up major roadblocks.

30:52.006 --> 30:54.122
They wouldn't give me access
to him or his bank records.

30:54.147 --> 30:56.390
We got an hour and 45.
Not enough time to subpoena them.

30:56.424 --> 30:58.592
Well, let's pull some favors,
go to the banks directly.

30:58.627 --> 31:00.327
It's a long shot, but worth a try.

31:01.786 --> 31:02.986
Dad.

31:03.232 --> 31:04.702
How's Mom?

31:05.563 --> 31:07.373
Tell her I'm sending good thoughts.

31:07.772 --> 31:10.361
Yeah, I'm in Indiana. Still here.

31:10.386 --> 31:12.221
That's why I called.

31:13.375 --> 31:17.144
It's a matter of life and death.
No exaggeration.

31:17.421 --> 31:21.552
I know it's a big favor, but,
um... could you put in a call?

31:22.090 --> 31:24.564
The President issued the death
warrant, and maybe if you...

31:29.724 --> 31:32.028
Yeah, I-I understand.

31:32.394 --> 31:34.474
Thanks anyway.

31:35.230 --> 31:37.024
I love you, too.

31:37.518 --> 31:39.117
Good luck tonight.

31:45.440 --> 31:47.085
I'm so sorry.

31:47.442 --> 31:48.776
Are you really?

31:50.779 --> 31:53.905
We're just... running out of time.

31:54.849 --> 31:56.455
Couldn't find a way.

31:56.558 --> 31:58.559
I'll keep trying. Don't give up.

32:02.123 --> 32:07.066
I remember one night
with my wife and son.

32:08.296 --> 32:12.013
We were out in a field
counting shooting stars.

32:13.592 --> 32:15.186
It was quiet.

32:16.404 --> 32:18.920
Just us and the stars.

32:22.444 --> 32:24.111
They're not coming to see me die.

32:24.145 --> 32:25.566
We'll be there for you.

32:25.591 --> 32:28.146
No. I don't want you
remembering me like that.

32:28.328 --> 32:30.663
Not you. Go. Live.

32:38.326 --> 32:39.860
It's time to start the walk.

32:57.950 --> 33:00.169
I'm sure I'm wrong about Heaven.

33:04.652 --> 33:06.067
We'll see.

33:49.771 --> 33:52.273
In New York,
polling places are set to close

33:52.307 --> 33:53.875
in just under two hours,

33:53.909 --> 33:56.878
and with 73% of precincts reporting,

33:56.912 --> 34:00.105
things are looking good for
former First Lady Harper Morrison

34:00.130 --> 34:02.191
in the New York State Senate race.

34:02.216 --> 34:03.360
That's right, Nick.

34:03.385 --> 34:05.585
Exit polls indicate she is doing very...

34:05.610 --> 34:07.889
The tacks show where
each of the money orders used

34:07.923 --> 34:10.302
to pay Harold to kill Tom
were purchased.

34:10.327 --> 34:12.411
You said that already.

34:12.551 --> 34:14.574
Like 10 times.

34:14.833 --> 34:16.558
I'm hoping if I say it
over and over again,

34:16.583 --> 34:19.634
we'll finally notice a pattern,
and that pattern will lead us

34:19.668 --> 34:21.636
to who bought the money orders...

34:22.266 --> 34:24.953
who really hired Harold to kill Tom.

34:32.414 --> 34:35.609
Okay, the tacks show
where each of the money orders

34:35.641 --> 34:39.342
used to pay Harold
to kill Tom were purchased.

35:07.964 --> 35:10.298
We're sure he's guilty, right?

35:10.584 --> 35:12.251
Wish we were.

35:23.666 --> 35:25.674
The demographics in the final precincts

35:25.699 --> 35:27.674
are not expected to change the outcome,

35:27.699 --> 35:30.738
so now we're just waiting
to officially project

35:30.772 --> 35:33.403
the winner as Harper Morrison.

35:33.575 --> 35:34.875
Look at the groupings of tacks.

35:34.910 --> 35:37.049
The 4, 5, 6 subway runs
through all of them. See it?

35:37.074 --> 35:39.880
From the Upper East Side
to Union Square to downtown.

35:39.915 --> 35:42.696
Look at the downtown grouping.
It's right around Foley Square.

35:42.728 --> 35:44.499
That's where
the U.S. Attorney's office is,

35:44.524 --> 35:46.754
and Bill Newton,
the prosecutor on Earl's case,

35:46.788 --> 35:48.353
lives in the Upper East Side.

35:48.378 --> 35:49.857
But why would he order the hit?

35:49.891 --> 35:52.500
Find Nina, Earl's co-worker,
the one that had the memo.

35:52.525 --> 35:54.293
I'm innocent.

35:56.286 --> 35:58.011
Any other last words?

36:00.869 --> 36:03.904
Thanks for always being decent.

36:06.475 --> 36:08.127
Same to you.

36:09.040 --> 36:10.767
Nina, this is important.

36:10.792 --> 36:12.187
You said you gave the memo

36:12.212 --> 36:15.009
that showed Sean Rasmullen was
embezzling to Tom Simon.

36:15.034 --> 36:17.234
- That's right.
- You delivered it to him in person?

36:17.259 --> 36:20.228
I didn't want Earl being blamed
for something he didn't do.

36:20.253 --> 36:22.346
This was the man you gave the memo to?

36:22.371 --> 36:24.127
Yes. Tom Simon.

36:24.152 --> 36:27.016
We met at a coffee shop,
and I handed it to him.

36:34.636 --> 36:36.604
Wallace, it was Bill, Bill Newton.

36:36.638 --> 36:37.801
He was the one taking the bribes.

36:37.826 --> 36:40.905
It wasn't Tom... it was Bill,
and he had Tom killed.

36:40.930 --> 36:43.565
We traced the payments back to him.
He paid for the hit.

36:43.590 --> 36:45.846
Wallace, you have to stop
that execution. Call me back.

36:47.174 --> 36:48.916
It was Bill who got that memo.

36:48.950 --> 36:51.318
I mean, he got the call from Nina.
Tom was away on vacation.

36:51.353 --> 36:54.622
He knew Harold Redding and Earl
were in Allenwood together.

36:54.656 --> 36:56.824
He used Harold
to pin the whole thing on Earl.

36:56.858 --> 36:59.060
There were massive deposits
made into Bill's accounts

36:59.094 --> 37:00.628
around the time of Earl's fraud case.

37:00.662 --> 37:02.997
They were payoffs
for making that memo go away.

37:03.031 --> 37:06.767
Bill appealed the stay of execution
because he wants Earl dead!

37:46.242 --> 37:48.273
...wants him out of the way.
Earl is innocent.

37:48.298 --> 37:52.012
We can't let him die. We can't.
We have to find a way...

38:45.153 --> 38:46.719
I'm not cleaning up your mess again.

39:14.796 --> 39:16.149
Hayes?

39:19.641 --> 39:21.696
I know it's terrible.

39:23.972 --> 39:26.069
But we got Bill.

39:26.975 --> 39:28.776
He's going down for capital murder.

39:30.883 --> 39:32.912
Please say something.

39:34.115 --> 39:35.553
Open the door.

39:37.349 --> 39:39.965
I knew I couldn't do this job.
I told you.

39:41.738 --> 39:43.551
Open the door.

39:47.886 --> 39:49.597
I gave him hope.

39:51.299 --> 39:53.589
You wanted the truth, and I found it.

39:56.204 --> 39:57.542
Earl was innocent.

39:58.707 --> 40:00.042
I know.

40:00.237 --> 40:03.042
And he... he died anyway.

40:05.013 --> 40:06.747
I couldn't save him.

40:06.781 --> 40:07.934
You did everything you could.

40:10.437 --> 40:12.459
I told him he was worm food.

40:14.541 --> 40:15.758
Why did I do that?

40:18.026 --> 40:19.801
What do I know?

40:20.629 --> 40:21.996
Open the door.
