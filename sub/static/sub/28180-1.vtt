27:45.171 --> 27:46.838
What did the doctor say?

27:47.880 --> 27:50.213
That they don't know 
who or what they're dealing with.

27:50.630 --> 27:51.505
Dad!

27:52.171 --> 27:53.046
[sobs]

27:54.463 --> 27:56.421
I'm full of steel.
You're not going to hurt me.

28:02.338 --> 28:03.630
[Cory sobs]

28:14.921 --> 28:16.088
She's good.

28:16.671 --> 28:19.171
Strong. Very strong.

28:19.255 --> 28:20.796
She's got a drive like I never had.

28:20.880 --> 28:24.255
Looks like that girls is not stopping
till she gets to the NFR.

28:24.755 --> 28:27.046
National Finals?
She's got college in the fall.

28:27.630 --> 28:28.796
She know that?

28:35.421 --> 28:36.546
So, you'll coach me?

28:39.338 --> 28:42.546
[clicks tongue] We start
Saturday morning. Be here at 7:00 a.m.

28:43.130 --> 28:45.171
You're late, we're done.

28:48.463 --> 28:50.005
[horse whinnies]

28:50.630 --> 28:53.130
[airplane lands]

28:57.588 --> 28:59.421
Everybody is here to see you.

29:00.421 --> 29:02.796
Mom, I can't. I'm too tired.

29:03.213 --> 29:04.796
Please just get me out of here.

29:05.421 --> 29:07.255
-Cory, who are all these people?
-[crowd cheer]

29:07.338 --> 29:09.296
[Cory]
They're all here to support our girl.

29:09.380 --> 29:10.546
And guess what.

29:10.630 --> 29:13.630
MLB Players' Assistance Team, 
they donated to pay for the flight.

29:14.213 --> 29:15.880
Yeah, they helped with this also.

29:16.005 --> 29:18.046
[gasps] That's wonderful, but...

29:18.463 --> 29:21.005
she can't handle that right now.
I gotta get her to the hospital.

29:21.588 --> 29:23.130
[Amberley] Tell them all thank you.

29:23.213 --> 29:24.546
I'll take care of it, kid.

29:31.338 --> 29:32.463
[nurse]] Ma'am, we're ready.

29:37.338 --> 29:38.921
You're a good man, Cory Snyder.

29:39.421 --> 29:40.713
I keep telling you that.

29:45.421 --> 29:46.713
[paramedic] Ready to roll, Mike.

29:46.796 --> 29:48.463
[engine revvs]

29:53.588 --> 29:56.463
[Nurse Felice hums]

30:00.796 --> 30:03.130
[groans] Do that later.

30:03.796 --> 30:08.755
Oh, no, sweet pea, we must rotate
our body every two hours,

30:09.255 --> 30:13.796
or we will get pressure sores,
and we don't want that.

30:14.088 --> 30:14.921
[Amberley]
We?

30:15.505 --> 30:17.421
Somebody needs to roll you too?

30:17.505 --> 30:19.421
Ha! They can try.

30:20.005 --> 30:21.713
Why don't you show me how to do that?

30:22.046 --> 30:26.505
Now, no, what would you have me do 
if I showed you how to do my job?

30:26.588 --> 30:29.588
Well, I'm here 24/7.
I can haul 100 bales of hay.

30:29.671 --> 30:30.505
I can handle this.

30:30.588 --> 30:32.588
Mom, you gotta go work the horses.

30:32.671 --> 30:34.296
Nope, everybody's pitching in.

30:34.380 --> 30:36.338
Well, you don't need to stay here.

30:36.421 --> 30:37.380
Hey.

30:37.755 --> 30:38.880
I'm not going anywhere.

30:39.463 --> 30:41.671
Face it. You're stuck with me.

30:41.755 --> 30:43.463
Like mother, like daughter.

30:45.880 --> 30:46.963
What's that?

30:48.296 --> 30:49.838
Learn to love that chair.

30:49.921 --> 30:51.088
That is your freedom.

30:52.588 --> 30:53.880
I'll check in on you later.

30:54.463 --> 30:56.880
We are going to get ourselves 
right out of your hair.

30:56.963 --> 30:58.588
We need some lunch.

31:02.546 --> 31:04.130
Blessings abound, my child.

31:04.671 --> 31:06.505
Sometimes a little tough to see.

31:25.421 --> 31:27.421
[cheers and applause]

31:30.380 --> 31:33.255
Come on, Am. Let's go! Dig!

31:33.338 --> 31:34.505
Use your legs, Am!

31:34.588 --> 31:35.713
Let's go!

31:39.713 --> 31:40.796
Dig!

31:40.880 --> 31:42.046
Let's go!

31:43.005 --> 31:46.463
Go! Let's go! Go!

31:46.546 --> 31:47.505
Go!

31:49.463 --> 31:51.421
[announcer over speaker] 17.6 seconds.

31:51.505 --> 31:55.630
That puts Amberley Snyder in second place.
Give her a round of applause.

31:59.130 --> 32:00.963
[JC] Dad, she was so close.

32:01.421 --> 32:02.588
Let me talk to her.

32:05.713 --> 32:07.005
You got some work to do.

32:07.630 --> 32:09.880
Second place, first loser.

32:10.255 --> 32:11.588
Be better next time.

32:11.671 --> 32:14.546
We should have beaten that time.
Power really fought me.

32:15.130 --> 32:16.171
No excuses.

32:17.421 --> 32:18.838
You want to be the best,

32:19.380 --> 32:21.046
second place won't cut it.

32:22.213 --> 32:23.463
She knows that.

32:29.546 --> 32:31.421
[Diego] Right, okay.

32:32.296 --> 32:34.421
So, first step here,

32:34.505 --> 32:37.130
we want to build up our strength
and our balance.

32:38.380 --> 32:40.088
Go ahead and lock your wheels for me.

32:40.338 --> 32:41.171
[clicks]

32:43.838 --> 32:45.005
[Diego] Mm-hmm.

32:45.088 --> 32:48.005
And you can go ahead and lift your legs 
out of your leg rests.

32:48.088 --> 32:50.963
Now, some tools that really help us
to speed along our work:

32:51.130 --> 32:53.338
focus and goals.

32:53.671 --> 32:56.546
So, let's start with the easy ones.
What are things you see yourself doing?

32:57.171 --> 32:59.588
Easy. Walk. Ride. Rodeo.

33:01.296 --> 33:02.213
Okay.

33:02.755 --> 33:03.713
That came out fast.

33:03.796 --> 33:05.880
My daughter, not one to hold back.

33:05.963 --> 33:07.130
[Diego chuckles]

33:07.255 --> 33:09.838
No, very ambitious goals.

33:09.921 --> 33:11.796
I love a challenge. Okay.

33:12.296 --> 33:14.671
So, what we wanna do is
we wanna get into a standing position.

33:15.255 --> 33:18.380
So, go ahead and grab a bar
with each arm, okay?

33:18.463 --> 33:20.838
You're gonna use that upper body strength
to pull yourself up.

33:20.921 --> 33:24.130
Now, this first time, I'm gonna be doing
the majority of the work, all right?

33:24.213 --> 33:25.046
I've got you.

33:25.130 --> 33:25.963
-Okay?
-Okay.

33:26.046 --> 33:26.921
All right.

33:27.505 --> 33:30.505
So, on the count of three,
we're gonna rock,

33:31.546 --> 33:32.963
and we're gonna get you up.

33:33.046 --> 33:34.046
Ready?

33:34.130 --> 33:36.088
One, two, three.

33:38.713 --> 33:39.921
Great.

33:40.005 --> 33:41.630
Yep, you're standing.

33:42.213 --> 33:43.171
How do you feel?

33:44.296 --> 33:45.130
Mom,

33:45.213 --> 33:46.755
Diego is touching my butt.

33:46.838 --> 33:50.046
Nope, these are your hips.
I'm at your hips.

33:50.130 --> 33:52.755
Diego, it looks like
you're touching my daughter's butt.

33:52.838 --> 33:55.088
Ma'am, this is part of what we have...

33:55.171 --> 33:56.838
[Amberley and Tina laugh]

34:00.421 --> 34:03.130
I see how it is here.
You two are funny.

34:03.213 --> 34:05.755
All right, I'm putting you down, 
all right? Come on.

34:05.838 --> 34:07.130
[Diego groans]

34:07.838 --> 34:08.671
Really good.

34:09.213 --> 34:11.255
Okay. All right, this time,

34:12.171 --> 34:13.755
you're gonna do the majority of the work.

34:14.505 --> 34:17.505
You might not get standing all the way up,
and that's okay.

34:17.588 --> 34:20.130
We just want to build up 
that upper body strength, okay?

34:21.005 --> 34:23.880
All right, same thing.
We're gonna go on the count of three.

34:25.171 --> 34:26.963
Give it all you got. Ready?

34:27.755 --> 34:29.755
One, two, three.

34:30.255 --> 34:31.713
Yep, try to stand.
Come on.

34:31.796 --> 34:32.671
[grunts]

34:32.755 --> 34:35.088
Push. Really good.

34:35.171 --> 34:37.505
Really, you got it. Yes!

34:37.588 --> 34:39.130
[exhales sharply]

34:39.213 --> 34:40.796
Hey.

34:40.880 --> 34:43.421
We're gonna make
a little progress every day, yeah?

34:43.505 --> 34:45.505
All right, let's--
Hold on.

34:46.088 --> 34:48.421
We're gonna do this together, okay?
You gotta wait for me.

34:48.505 --> 34:49.671
Come on.

34:51.171 --> 34:52.588
All right, count of three. 

34:53.255 --> 34:55.005
One, two, three.

34:55.796 --> 34:58.130
Yep. Drop.

34:58.213 --> 34:59.671
-Drop. All right.
-[exhales]

35:00.255 --> 35:01.088

One, two, three.

35:07.671 --> 35:08.630
Yep, come on. Push.

35:08.713 --> 35:10.588
There you go. You go this. Keep going.

35:10.671 --> 35:11.671
Come on.

35:11.755 --> 35:14.171
-Yep, push!
-[pants] Mom.

35:14.255 --> 35:15.713
Drop. Perfect.

35:15.796 --> 35:16.880
We're done. We're done here.

35:17.713 --> 35:19.838
No, she's doing really good.
Do you wanna stop?

35:19.921 --> 35:21.296
Yeah, we're done.

35:22.088 --> 35:22.963
Okay.

35:31.088 --> 35:32.255

35:46.255 --> 35:48.880
-[cries] Get the door?
-Okay, baby. Okay.

35:50.963 --> 35:53.130
I'm sorry, honey. It's okay.

36:00.838 --> 36:02.546
[Amberley cries]

36:04.296 --> 36:06.296

at the house.

36:07.171 --> 36:10.713
He's even putting in a custom elevator 
in the pantry.

36:11.463 --> 36:14.296
And Autumn is so excited to see you.
Everyone is.

36:14.963 --> 36:15.921
Great.

36:16.005 --> 36:19.880
Oh, and before I forget,
this kid, Tate Watkins, keeps emailing.

36:19.963 --> 36:22.546
You had that FFA speech scheduled
for the end of next month.

36:22.630 --> 36:24.755
You have to cancel it. I can't.

36:24.838 --> 36:26.880
No, yeah. I mean,
that's what I told him.

36:27.255 --> 36:29.421
But this kid is funny.
He really wants you there.

36:29.838 --> 36:32.296
He said he's going to be re-schedule it
for when you get better.

36:32.380 --> 36:34.755
Oh! When am I gonna get better?

36:36.255 --> 36:37.963
I'm not going in this thing.

36:50.796 --> 36:52.255
[knock on door]

36:52.713 --> 36:55.963
[gasps] Hey! Look who's here. 

36:56.046 --> 36:57.755
-Put that away.
-Okay.

36:59.421 --> 37:00.380
[Tina] Hi.

37:02.338 --> 37:05.130
-Hey, guys.
-Hey.

37:05.671 --> 37:07.213
Dad is picking up Taylor and Aubrey.

37:07.296 --> 37:09.463
Yeah, they'll be here
in, like, 15 minutes.

37:16.213 --> 37:18.046
So, who's riding Power?

37:19.088 --> 37:19.921
Me.

37:20.755 --> 37:22.005
Did he buck yet?

37:23.255 --> 37:24.088
I told her.

37:24.796 --> 37:26.255
I got right back on him.

37:26.963 --> 37:27.838
Good.

for yourself,

you're gonna find things that

40:29.505 --> 40:32.338
I'm spending my 19th birthday here...

40:33.588 --> 40:34.421
like this.

40:34.505 --> 40:35.713
What's the point?

40:36.380 --> 40:37.338
Look...

40:38.088 --> 40:39.380
it takes time.

40:41.255 --> 40:45.296
I'm stuck in that chair 
for the rest of my life.

40:45.380 --> 40:46.755
Okay, I know. I get it.

40:46.838 --> 40:48.171
[shouts] You don't get it.

40:49.505 --> 40:51.046
You don't get it.

40:51.130 --> 40:53.880
I am so sick 
of you feeling sorry for yourself.

40:54.671 --> 40:58.171
How long did it take you and Power 
to put together a good barrel run?

40:58.255 --> 40:59.921
-But that's different!
-No, it's not.

41:00.005 --> 41:02.755
Now, get in. 
You're going to therapy.

41:03.171 --> 41:04.130
[Tina] See you there.

41:17.671 --> 41:19.130
[Amberley] What are you doing here?

41:21.171 --> 41:23.671
[Cory] Diego said you were having
balance issues.

41:24.671 --> 41:26.546
Remember where your balance was best?

41:35.255 --> 41:36.796
Happy birthday, baby girl.

41:38.130 --> 41:39.921
We both know that you were best 
in the saddle.

41:40.838 --> 41:42.421
It's where you learned balance.

41:44.421 --> 41:45.380
It makes sense.

41:47.921 --> 41:49.255
So, what's the plan?

41:50.546 --> 41:52.671
Am, if it's not to ride again, so be it.

41:53.380 --> 41:55.338
But it won't be because you didn't try.

41:56.713 --> 41:59.005
One, two, three.

41:59.296 --> 42:00.921
[grunts]

42:05.963 --> 42:06.796
Okay.

42:07.213 --> 42:08.921
Reposition. Good.

42:10.796 --> 42:11.880
This feels weird.

42:12.796 --> 42:14.421
All right. Hey, straighten up.

42:15.588 --> 42:17.838
Use your upper body position
to find your balance.

42:18.838 --> 42:19.671
Yeah?

42:20.380 --> 42:21.463
Feel your core.

42:23.963 --> 42:25.171
Trust your instincts.

42:26.171 --> 42:27.171
You got this.

42:33.588 --> 42:34.671
I'm gonna let you go.

42:36.213 --> 42:37.171
Find your balance.

42:39.796 --> 42:41.796
[chuckles]

42:42.838 --> 42:43.838
[exhales]

42:48.088 --> 42:49.755
[chuckles]

42:57.255 --> 42:59.255
When I come back, 
you better have those shoes on.

42:59.338 --> 43:01.213
-[Tuck] Stay the hell out!
-Oh...

43:02.046 --> 43:03.005
Boy!

43:03.088 --> 43:04.921
[Felice] You better be glad that missed.

43:06.046 --> 43:06.963
Hey, Felice.

43:08.171 --> 43:09.963
[Amberley] That's Tuck Morgan, right?

43:10.046 --> 43:11.255
Oh, yes.

43:11.838 --> 43:14.963
You know, that boy is trying 
my last damn nerve.

43:15.880 --> 43:17.380
He came in last week.

43:18.130 --> 43:19.505
Terrible car crash.

43:19.588 --> 43:21.255
Mmm. I heard about him.

43:22.046 --> 43:23.296
He's a bull rider.

43:23.755 --> 43:24.755
[chuckles] Oui!

43:25.546 --> 43:27.421
A very angry bull rider.

43:28.046 --> 43:30.255
The child won't start therapy.

43:30.338 --> 43:32.296
He refuses to talk to anyone.

43:33.671 --> 43:34.505
I get it.

43:36.921 --> 43:38.213
I knew you would.

43:50.505 --> 43:51.630
[Amberley] Tuck, right?

43:52.588 --> 43:53.546
Get out.

43:54.296 --> 43:57.630
I'm Amberley. How you doing?

44:01.130 --> 44:01.963
Fine.

44:04.088 --> 44:05.713
I used to say, "Fine."

44:07.338 --> 44:09.005
But I know it's not fine.

44:09.796 --> 44:11.796
And I know it's not good. I mean...

44:14.088 --> 44:15.005
[Amberley] I know.

44:17.088 --> 44:18.588
The doctors came in.

44:19.130 --> 44:20.921
That nurse, my family,

44:22.088 --> 44:25.380
all they wanted to hear
was that I was fine.

44:26.630 --> 44:27.463
But...

44:28.505 --> 44:30.713
inside, I knew how bad it was.

44:32.255 --> 44:33.921
My future was...

44:35.546 --> 44:36.588
pretty bleak.

44:37.171 --> 44:38.505
No one could understand that.

44:38.588 --> 44:40.088
My life is over.

44:41.505 --> 44:42.380
Done.

44:45.921 --> 44:47.630
I used to feel that way.

44:49.463 --> 44:52.338
I can't do anything for myself anymore.

44:52.421 --> 44:53.880
That's just not me.

44:55.046 --> 44:59.796
[Amberley] I used to throw a saddle
on my horse and ride all day.

45:00.713 --> 45:02.296
No one could stop me.

45:11.255 --> 45:13.255
Got better for me when I started therapy

45:13.338 --> 45:16.296
-Not doing therapy.
-Not forcing you.

45:21.421 --> 45:22.671
But it might help.

45:23.505 --> 45:24.505
Really helped me.

45:25.921 --> 45:27.671
You're still never gonna walk again.

45:30.338 --> 45:31.463
Maybe not.

45:33.296 --> 45:34.755
But I'll tell you what.

45:35.713 --> 45:37.588
I am gonna get on a horse again.

45:37.671 --> 45:39.130
That's crazy.

45:39.796 --> 45:41.088
[Amberley] You know what's crazy?

45:42.296 --> 45:44.880
Eight seconds on a bull, but...

45:46.046 --> 45:47.421
you've already done that.

45:56.546 --> 46:00.505
Everybody got their money for the lotto?
We are going to win this time.

46:00.963 --> 46:01.880
Felice!

46:02.505 --> 46:04.005
[chuckles] Today is the day.

46:04.171 --> 46:07.130
Wow, well...
you've been a handful.

46:07.713 --> 46:08.755
I'll miss you, too.

46:09.588 --> 46:10.421
Aw!

46:12.005 --> 46:12.963
[Amberley] Mmm.

46:13.046 --> 46:14.546
[Felice chuckles]

46:15.796 --> 46:17.255
Really hope you cheer up.

46:17.338 --> 46:20.588
[laughs] Honey, this is what
I've been blessed with.

46:21.671 --> 46:24.796
Now, you go on home and get your glory.

46:26.755 --> 46:30.755
[Tina] Felice, thank you.
We never could have done this without you.

46:31.505 --> 46:32.588
Hey.

46:33.630 --> 46:35.171
[Amberley] Looks like I'm graduating.

46:35.921 --> 46:36.921
[Diego] Mm-hmm.

46:37.921 --> 46:39.213
Don't sweat the curbs.

46:39.880 --> 46:42.130
And remember that going up 
is your biggest threat, okay?

46:42.213 --> 46:45.088
-Get that momentum. Pop a wheelie--
-I know.

46:47.213 --> 46:49.505
Diego, you have been amazing.

46:51.338 --> 46:52.255
So have you.

46:55.088 --> 46:57.213
Listen, out there...

46:58.421 --> 47:00.171
no matter what life gives you...

47:01.338 --> 47:02.338
give more back.

47:05.255 --> 47:06.088
You know it.

47:08.046 --> 47:09.130
Bye, Amberley.

47:25.255 --> 47:26.380
[Diego] Tuck.

47:27.838 --> 47:28.963
You ready, man?

47:30.046 --> 47:33.088
[Diego] So, why don't we talk about
the things that you see yourself doing?

47:33.171 --> 47:36.171
'Cause if we have a goal,
you keep picturing it in your mind,

47:36.255 --> 47:37.630
you can stay focused on it.

47:39.046 --> 47:40.546
[Tina] Home, sweet home.

47:40.630 --> 47:43.213
[Amberley] Mom, I don't think
I'm ready for this.

47:47.213 --> 47:48.171
No one is home, right?

47:48.255 --> 47:50.630
Just your dad.
Ashley took everyone to dinner.

47:56.255 --> 47:57.630
Welcome home, baby girl.

47:59.088 --> 48:01.213
-[Tina] Hey, you wanna get that chair?
-Sure.

48:01.588 --> 48:02.421
Okay.

48:03.921 --> 48:05.380
[Tina] Put this down first.

48:08.255 --> 48:09.588
-[Tina] Sorry.
-[Cory] It's okay.

48:09.671 --> 48:10.505
Okay.

48:15.713 --> 48:17.713
[soft music plays]

48:56.796 --> 48:57.963
[sighs]

49:11.463 --> 49:14.338
[nickers]

49:22.130 --> 49:25.338
I'm headed out.
I've gotta go pick up Aubrey from dance.

49:26.463 --> 49:27.296
Here you go.

49:27.880 --> 49:29.046
You gonna be all right?

49:29.713 --> 49:31.171
Can't get very far.

49:31.880 --> 49:32.796
Amberley...

49:33.505 --> 49:34.338
I'm fine.

49:35.671 --> 49:36.796
I'll be home soon.

50:04.171 --> 50:06.796
[Amberley strains]

50:18.005 --> 50:20.171
[pants] Hey, guys.

50:24.005 --> 50:25.421
-Remember me?
-[horse nickers]

50:25.880 --> 50:27.880
[pants]

50:29.130 --> 50:30.630
Hi, Lacey.

50:32.546 --> 50:34.005
Did you miss me?

50:37.088 --> 50:38.505
Hey, Power.

50:40.546 --> 50:41.796
You miss me?

50:42.963 --> 50:44.296
Power, come here.

50:44.713 --> 50:45.713
[horse nickers]

50:47.338 --> 50:48.380
[sighs]

50:51.630 --> 50:52.963
I'm sorry.

50:53.046 --> 50:57.546
I wish I could saddle you up
and just go for a ride, you and me.

50:57.630 --> 51:00.296

[voicemail]
Hey, there. It's Tina Snyder.

51:38.463 --> 51:41.046
Go on and leave a message,
and you have a blessed day.

51:41.130 --> 51:43.963
Hey, Mom, just curious
when you're coming home.

51:44.421 --> 51:45.255
Call me.

51:47.713 --> 51:48.880
[exhales sharply]

51:48.963 --> 51:50.171
[strains]

51:54.380 --> 51:55.463
[shouts] Mom!

51:56.255 --> 51:57.380
Hey, Mom!

51:58.713 --> 51:59.838
Mom, look!

51:59.921 --> 52:01.338
Hey, Mom!

52:02.838 --> 52:03.963
[Amberley shouts] Mom!

52:04.463 --> 52:07.588
Look at that. My plan worked.
Leaving the horses out.

52:08.005 --> 52:09.463
I knew she couldn't resist.

52:15.588 --> 52:16.505
[strains]

52:18.463 --> 52:19.921
[strains] Oh!

52:21.630 --> 52:23.630
[pants]

52:28.005 --> 52:29.088
I'm sorry.

52:30.505 --> 52:32.255
I was waving you over.

52:32.338 --> 52:34.046
I was stuck. You couldn't tell?

52:34.130 --> 52:36.130
I was so happy to see you 
with those horses.

52:36.213 --> 52:38.421
-I just... I didn't know.
-Just--

52:38.505 --> 52:40.713
Just leave me alone.

52:41.671 --> 52:43.130
I can't do that.

52:49.380 --> 52:50.588
I'm your Mamacita,

52:51.171 --> 52:52.630
and I'm not going anywhere.

52:53.671 --> 52:58.005
And I'm going to be here for both of us
until you can be there for yourself.

53:00.713 --> 53:02.255
Will you promise me something?

53:04.088 --> 53:05.005
Anything.

53:07.421 --> 53:08.963
That I'll ride again.

53:11.755 --> 53:14.755
If I have to strap you 
in that saddle myself.

53:15.630 --> 53:16.921
[chuckles]

53:29.421 --> 53:31.171
You and me, bubba.

53:31.255 --> 53:32.713
-You ready?
-[sighs]

53:32.796 --> 53:34.838
Are you seriously asking me that?

53:41.880 --> 53:43.505
All right, here we go.

53:48.338 --> 53:49.630
[exhales sharply]

53:50.755 --> 53:51.588
[sighs]

53:56.088 --> 53:57.130
Yeah, Amberley!

53:57.213 --> 53:58.921
-Woo!
-Come on, Am.

53:59.921 --> 54:01.255
[Tina] How does it feel, Am?

54:03.713 --> 54:04.755
Fine.

54:12.380 --> 54:14.755
-[Emmy] Yeah, Am!
-[Ashley] You got this, Am!

54:14.838 --> 54:16.213
[Autumn]
Woo! You got this!

54:17.796 --> 54:18.796
Stop!

54:22.296 --> 54:24.130
What's wrong? 
Don't you wanna go in the arena?

54:24.546 --> 54:25.380
No.

54:29.046 --> 54:30.213
Take me in.

54:31.088 --> 54:33.213
Hey, you'll have to give this a chance.

54:34.546 --> 54:36.171
It's never gonna be the same.

54:37.130 --> 54:39.088
I could tell the second I got up here.

54:40.046 --> 54:41.630
There's nothing I can do about it.

54:42.671 --> 54:44.755
-Am...
-Just get me off this thing.

54:51.463 --> 54:53.671
All right, that's gonna be enough 
for today.

54:55.296 --> 54:57.130
[Autumn]
No, I wanna see you ride more.

54:57.213 --> 54:58.505
[Tina] Maybe another time.

55:06.713 --> 55:09.088
[Emmy] You know that was
just the first time out, right?

55:09.921 --> 55:10.880
Yeah.

55:12.296 --> 55:13.880
When I look at you,

55:15.296 --> 55:17.963
I still see the same girl I knew 
before the accident.

55:19.630 --> 55:20.588
I'm different.

55:20.671 --> 55:21.755
No, you're not.

55:24.505 --> 55:25.838
Not on the inside.

55:27.796 --> 55:29.380
The Amberley I know wouldn't be beaten

55:29.463 --> 55:31.921
until she'd done 
absolutely everything she could first.

55:34.213 --> 55:36.005
You can't understand.

55:37.546 --> 55:38.713
Nobody can.

55:48.588 --> 55:49.546
Love you.

56:06.046 --> 56:08.255
[Autumn] She's hardly been down here 
with the horses.

56:08.338 --> 56:10.380
Autumn, you gotta give her some time.

56:10.463 --> 56:13.380
Until then, these horses aren't gonna
clean up after themselves.

56:13.463 --> 56:14.630
Hey, buster!

56:16.380 --> 56:18.380
Go on. Go get the wheelbarrow.

[Skype rings and connects]

56:46.338 --> 56:47.213
Hello?

56:47.296 --> 56:48.921
[Amberley] Why won't you leave me alone?

56:49.671 --> 56:51.046
-What?
-Oh!

56:51.130 --> 56:53.963
Tate, good morning. Amberley Snyder.

56:58.213 --> 56:59.338
Did I wake you up?

56:59.796 --> 57:02.130
No, it's okay. I'm up.

57:02.213 --> 57:04.380
Yeah, you need to stop
emailing me.

57:04.463 --> 57:05.380
I don't know you,

57:05.463 --> 57:08.130

1:08:10.171 --> 1:08:11.213
And the last time you were,

1:08:11.296 --> 1:08:13.296
you said you were never getting 
on your horse again.

1:08:15.213 --> 1:08:16.921
I miss it so much.

1:08:17.005 --> 1:08:18.630
I mean, are you up for this?

1:08:19.255 --> 1:08:20.755
What about your new dreams?

1:08:21.713 --> 1:08:24.546
Well, I can't bail now.

1:08:27.630 --> 1:08:30.421
The doctors asked me what my goals were.

1:08:30.505 --> 1:08:31.546
I knew right away:

1:08:31.630 --> 1:08:33.713
Walk. Ride. Rodeo.

1:08:33.796 --> 1:08:35.005
That's a tall order.

1:08:35.588 --> 1:08:37.255
[Jenna]
Is there a future in rodeo?

1:08:40.630 --> 1:08:44.880
Really, I'm the only one 
who can decide what I'm capable of.

1:08:46.213 --> 1:08:48.088
I've got a lot of work to do.

1:08:49.296 --> 1:08:50.421
But, hey,

1:08:51.005 --> 1:08:53.921
whatever life gives you,
you've got three choices.

1:08:54.421 --> 1:08:57.921
You can either give up, give in,
or give it your all.

1:08:58.005 --> 1:09:01.671
And I figured it was time 
that I gave it my all.

1:09:02.713 --> 1:09:03.880
Thank you, Amberley.

1:09:03.963 --> 1:09:06.546
It's an incredible story.
We'll be watching for you.

1:09:08.546 --> 1:09:10.421
-That's it. I think we've got it.
-Cool.

1:09:10.505 --> 1:09:12.630
Let's just get some B-roll 
of her riding, okay?

1:09:12.713 --> 1:09:13.796
Good job.

1:09:20.338 --> 1:09:21.421
[Tina] Am is doing great.

1:09:22.088 --> 1:09:23.838
[chuckles] I know. It's crazy.

1:09:23.921 --> 1:09:26.005
Jenna Walters is just sitting in our barn.

1:09:27.380 --> 1:09:28.713
Well, they're about to finish up,

1:09:28.796 --> 1:09:31.630
and she's gonna get on Power,
and I'm freaking out a little bit, so...

1:09:32.963 --> 1:09:36.505
Yes, Cory, I promise.
I won't forget to breathe.

1:09:37.338 --> 1:09:39.380
-[Emmy] Amberley, you got this!
-[Tina] There you go.

1:09:39.505 --> 1:09:40.338
[Autumn] Come on, Am!

1:09:40.421 --> 1:09:42.005
[JC] You ready, Am?

1:09:42.088 --> 1:09:43.630
Hey, stay close.

1:09:44.421 --> 1:09:45.921
You and me, bubba.

1:09:46.005 --> 1:09:48.171
I can't tell you what to do 
with my legs anymore.

1:09:48.255 --> 1:09:49.421
Listen to my voice.

1:09:50.046 --> 1:09:52.255
Just once around. Easy.

1:09:52.380 --> 1:09:53.588
[horse neighs]

1:09:53.671 --> 1:09:55.880
[Emmy shouts]
Come on, you're a natural, you got this!

1:09:55.963 --> 1:09:57.296
[claps]

1:09:57.546 --> 1:09:58.796
Hey, you don't wanna miss this.

1:09:58.880 --> 1:09:59.838
[horse snorts]

1:09:59.921 --> 1:10:01.255
[claps]

1:10:03.796 --> 1:10:05.921
[Ashley] You got it, Am. Keep going.

1:10:06.921 --> 1:10:07.921
[Autumn] Woo!

1:10:08.338 --> 1:10:10.130
-[Autumn] Go, Am!
-[Emmy] Keep going, girl!

1:10:12.046 --> 1:10:13.963
[horse neighs]

1:10:14.046 --> 1:10:15.838
[Amberley] Whoa!

1:10:15.921 --> 1:10:16.755
[gasps]

1:10:16.880 --> 1:10:18.880
[cheer]

1:10:18.963 --> 1:10:20.380
Oh, sweet Jesus!

1:10:24.171 --> 1:10:25.171
[Amberley]
Whoa!

1:10:33.380 --> 1:10:34.671
[chuckles]

1:10:36.921 --> 1:10:38.671
-[Emmy] Come on, Am!
-[Autumn] Come on, Am!

1:10:39.046 --> 1:10:40.380
[crowd cheer]

1:10:41.630 --> 1:10:43.630
[breathes excitedly]

1:10:53.380 --> 1:10:55.380
[cheers]

1:10:59.880 --> 1:11:01.671
[Autumn] Keep going!

1:11:08.838 --> 1:11:11.046
Mom, he's behaving like a prince.

1:11:26.255 --> 1:11:27.546
Well, look at that!

1:11:29.088 --> 1:11:30.171
[chuckles]

1:11:30.255 --> 1:11:32.630
[cheers and applause]

1:11:41.338 --> 1:11:44.796
-[Tina] Am, you ready?
-[Amberley] Yeah, good.

1:11:45.213 --> 1:11:46.171
I'm ready.

1:11:48.546 --> 1:11:51.713
[announcer over speaker] Give it up
for number 17, Jenny Watkins.

1:11:55.755 --> 1:11:58.296
-Do you think Amberley will win?
-Heck, yeah!

1:11:59.713 --> 1:12:01.796
-You a fan?
-[Tate] Yes, sir.

1:12:02.546 --> 1:12:04.380
I'm Tate, Tate Watkins.

1:12:06.005 --> 1:12:07.255
The boy from Montana.

1:12:08.921 --> 1:12:10.421
We'll get acquainted later.

1:12:11.171 --> 1:12:12.713
[Tina] Excuse me. Okay.

1:12:13.088 --> 1:12:14.171
[sighs]

1:12:14.255 --> 1:12:16.463
What if she falls?
She gets hurt?

1:12:16.546 --> 1:12:18.880
Hey, I'm going nuts as it is.

1:12:18.963 --> 1:12:20.505
Sorry. Somebody had to say it.

1:12:20.588 --> 1:12:23.338
Am is just here for practice,
see what she can do.

1:12:23.421 --> 1:12:24.796
Yeah, well, she's gonna do great.

1:12:25.338 --> 1:12:26.546
Is she ready?

1:12:27.505 --> 1:12:28.963
I'm letting her decide that.

1:12:29.671 --> 1:12:31.963
-She's put in the work.
-She has.

1:12:38.255 --> 1:12:41.255
You ask me, I say
you haven't the sense God gave you!

1:12:41.796 --> 1:12:44.171
Letting your handicapped child on a horse.

1:12:44.255 --> 1:12:45.255
Handicapped?

1:12:45.338 --> 1:12:46.213
[woman] So reckless!

1:12:46.296 --> 1:12:48.088
What kind of a mother are you?

1:12:48.588 --> 1:12:49.421
[scoffs]

1:12:51.296 --> 1:12:52.130
You know what?

1:12:52.213 --> 1:12:54.380
I'm gonna show you
what kind of a mother I am.

1:12:54.463 --> 1:12:56.421
-[Cory] It's okay.
-Nobody asked you.

1:12:56.505 --> 1:12:58.088
That's right. Nobody asked you.

1:12:58.171 --> 1:13:00.380
-That is none of your--
-Hey, it's all right.

1:13:02.838 --> 1:13:05.713
[announcer] Up next,
we have a real comeback kid.

1:13:05.796 --> 1:13:07.796
Just months after her accident...

1:13:07.880 --> 1:13:10.380
I still can't believe this.

1:13:10.463 --> 1:13:14.755
...ready to take her first run,
Amberley Snyder on Power.

1:13:16.338 --> 1:13:20.046
[cheers and applause]

1:13:22.963 --> 1:13:24.838
-[Tate] Amberley!
-Come on, baby!

1:13:25.421 --> 1:13:26.255
Yeah!

1:13:27.213 --> 1:13:28.380
Who is that?

1:13:29.213 --> 1:13:30.630
The boy from Montana.

1:13:31.213 --> 1:13:32.213
Hmm!

1:13:32.296 --> 1:13:33.380
[Tate] Yeah!

1:13:38.630 --> 1:13:39.630
Hey, bubba,

1:13:41.505 --> 1:13:44.338
they said you and I would never be
back here.

1:13:46.255 --> 1:13:47.588
Welcome to never.

1:13:48.213 --> 1:13:49.630
[horse nickers]

1:13:49.755 --> 1:13:51.755
[uplifting guitar music plays]

1:14:03.880 --> 1:14:06.005
[crowd cheer and applaud]

1:14:18.588 --> 1:14:22.546
[announcer] 17.6 seconds.
Good enough for second place.

1:14:23.088 --> 1:14:26.213
What a ride, folks! What a ride!

1:14:26.296 --> 1:14:29.921
Amberley Snyder, give it up for her
one more time.

1:14:32.671 --> 1:14:33.963
Amberley is amazing!

1:14:35.838 --> 1:14:36.713
[Cory] Yeah!

1:14:37.588 --> 1:14:39.546
Second place, not first loser?

1:14:39.630 --> 1:14:40.755
[Amberly] No way!

1:14:40.838 --> 1:14:43.546
It feels like... I don't know.

1:14:43.630 --> 1:14:45.421
The greatest feeling ever.

1:14:45.505 --> 1:14:46.796
Yeah!

1:14:48.546 --> 1:14:49.505
[Cory] Way to go!

1:14:50.380 --> 1:14:51.546
[laughs]

1:15:08.505 --> 1:15:10.463
Ashley took them all out for pizza.

1:15:11.921 --> 1:15:13.546
Should be back in an hour or so.

1:15:18.921 --> 1:15:19.921
Tina, honey...

1:15:21.213 --> 1:15:22.296
what's going on?

1:15:22.671 --> 1:15:23.505
[Tina] I...

1:15:24.088 --> 1:15:24.921
I'm sorry.

1:15:25.005 --> 1:15:27.171
I should be happy, and I am. I just...

1:15:27.255 --> 1:15:28.088
I mean, she's...

1:15:28.630 --> 1:15:30.338
She's alive,

1:15:30.546 --> 1:15:32.838
and she's here,
and she's back on the horse.

1:15:33.421 --> 1:15:34.880
We got our girl back.

1:15:38.963 --> 1:15:40.880
[cries] But then I see her in that chair.

1:15:41.713 --> 1:15:44.255
I can't... I just can't do anything.

1:15:44.338 --> 1:15:46.755
I can't fix her. I can't protect her.

1:15:48.630 --> 1:15:51.921
Every time I look at her, it hits me.

1:15:55.630 --> 1:15:57.338
[cries] I told her
not to take that truck.

1:15:57.421 --> 1:15:59.880
You know, I stood there with her.

1:15:59.963 --> 1:16:04.463
-And I let her go.
-It's not your fault.

1:16:05.755 --> 1:16:06.796
[Tina cries]

1:16:09.255 --> 1:16:12.505
There's so many things
she's never gonna be able to do, you know?

1:16:14.171 --> 1:16:16.296
She's never gonna be able
to walk down the aisle.

1:16:17.505 --> 1:16:20.046
She's never gonna be able
to run with her kids.

1:16:21.380 --> 1:16:22.213
She's not gonna have

1:16:22.296 --> 1:16:23.963
-the same opportunities--
-She has you.

1:16:26.255 --> 1:16:27.880
No matter what happens.

1:16:30.630 --> 1:16:31.463
[sniffles]

1:16:35.505 --> 1:16:37.005
I say sky is the limit.

1:16:46.171 --> 1:16:48.588
[Amberley] Mom, you know
I can make a faster run.

1:16:49.546 --> 1:16:52.046
[Tina] I know, baby,
but let's take it one rodeo at a time.

1:16:53.546 --> 1:16:54.421
Hey, Am.

1:16:55.130 --> 1:16:55.963
Stacey!

1:16:56.046 --> 1:16:57.130
[Stacey] How is she riding?

1:16:58.046 --> 1:16:59.088
Like a winner.

1:16:59.588 --> 1:17:02.421
Still recovering, but getting there.

1:17:02.796 --> 1:17:06.171
Got word from Andrea Busby
at Busby Quarter Horses.

1:17:06.255 --> 1:17:08.505
They want to put you up 
for the Fan Favorite Exemption

1:17:08.588 --> 1:17:10.005
at The American this year.

1:17:10.088 --> 1:17:10.921
No way!

1:17:11.005 --> 1:17:12.255
[Autumn] That's awesome.

1:17:12.338 --> 1:17:13.338
It's a long shot,

1:17:13.421 --> 1:17:15.921
but they've been following your story,

1:17:16.005 --> 1:17:17.588
and they want to get it started for you.

1:17:17.671 --> 1:17:21.130
Power, do you hear that?
The American!

1:17:22.546 --> 1:17:23.546
[sighs]

1:17:24.338 --> 1:17:25.171
'Cita?

1:17:25.838 --> 1:17:27.713
Power is ready. Not sure about you.

1:17:28.463 --> 1:17:30.796
[Tina] The American is as big as it gets.

1:17:30.880 --> 1:17:31.755
Well,

1:17:32.296 --> 1:17:34.046
I guess we got work to do.

1:17:35.088 --> 1:17:36.338
[laughs]

1:17:36.671 --> 1:17:38.005
[horse neighs]

1:17:39.171 --> 1:17:40.796
[announcer 1] Incredible!

1:17:40.880 --> 1:17:42.880
Less than a year after her truck accident,

1:17:42.963 --> 1:17:47.838
Amberley Snyder is back
with a time of 17.7 seconds.

1:17:48.630 --> 1:17:50.838
[announcer 2] This cowgirl
continues to amaze.

1:17:50.921 --> 1:17:53.630
She is up for the Fan Favorite Exemption
at The American,

1:17:53.713 --> 1:17:55.546
and she is showing us why.

1:17:55.630 --> 1:17:57.921
17.5 seconds.

1:17:58.005 --> 1:18:00.921
That's a first-place finish 
for Amberley Snyder.

1:18:02.338 --> 1:18:03.880
[announcer 2] I simply can't believe it.

1:18:03.963 --> 1:18:07.838
17.42 seconds for Amberley Snyder.

1:18:08.296 --> 1:18:09.921
Look at this girl run.

1:18:10.005 --> 1:18:14.005
The American should make some room.
Unbelievable.

1:18:14.838 --> 1:18:17.755
[announcer 3] Give this little lady
a round of applause.

1:18:20.755 --> 1:18:22.963
[announcer 4] And she's coming around
the second barrel.

1:18:23.046 --> 1:18:24.130
It's a heck of a--

1:18:24.213 --> 1:18:26.046
Whoa!

1:18:26.380 --> 1:18:28.588
That's a downed barrel, folks.

1:18:29.213 --> 1:18:32.005
That's gonna cost her 
a five-second penalty.

1:18:32.546 --> 1:18:35.588
A time of 22.7 seconds.

1:18:35.671 --> 1:18:39.713
Putting Amberley Snyder
outside of our top five riders.

1:18:52.338 --> 1:18:53.838
-Hey.
-[Emmy] Hey.

1:18:56.005 --> 1:18:58.213
-That was a little rough.
-[Amberley] Yeah.

1:18:58.296 --> 1:19:01.588
Well, you're gonna have to get him ready
for regionals in Pocatello soon.

1:19:03.130 --> 1:19:03.963
[sighs]

1:19:05.005 --> 1:19:07.755
We gotta get faster
if I'm gonna go The American.

1:19:08.046 --> 1:19:09.213
We'll get you there.

1:19:09.838 --> 1:19:10.796
Ready?

1:19:12.505 --> 1:19:13.463
[grunts]

1:19:13.546 --> 1:19:14.880
Gotcha.

1:19:18.630 --> 1:19:19.755
Thanks.

1:19:20.046 --> 1:19:21.213
What's on your pants?

1:19:21.546 --> 1:19:22.421
Huh?

1:19:23.046 --> 1:19:23.880
Oh!

1:19:26.130 --> 1:19:28.255
I must have just sat in something.

1:19:28.713 --> 1:19:30.630
Smooth.

1:20:19.213 --> 1:20:20.755
Okay, who's next?

1:20:21.338 --> 1:20:23.921
That's the last one 
unless you wanna ride the donkey.

1:20:24.005 --> 1:20:26.130
[Tina] I do not know
what is going on with you.

1:20:26.213 --> 1:20:29.130
I don't know what kind of bug you got,
but it's making you all wonky.

1:20:29.713 --> 1:20:30.546
[Tina sighs]

1:20:33.005 --> 1:20:37.463
I'm gonna go inside,
and I'm gonna make you a protein smoothie.

1:20:39.213 --> 1:20:42.046
You need to start taking better care
of yourself. You know that?

1:20:43.213 --> 1:20:44.505
All right, give me your weight.

1:20:46.130 --> 1:20:47.296
[Tina] I got you. [strains]

1:20:48.380 --> 1:20:49.296
Okay.

1:20:52.796 --> 1:20:53.880
There you go.

1:20:54.796 --> 1:20:57.088
Those horses are getting hungry.
Come on. Let's go.

1:20:57.796 --> 1:20:59.630
I'll meet you inside, all right?

1:21:05.088 --> 1:21:06.880
Hey, Mom, I don't feel very--

1:21:06.963 --> 1:21:08.130
[Autumn shouts] Amberley!

1:21:10.255 --> 1:21:11.171
[Tina] Baby.

1:21:12.671 --> 1:21:14.671
Come here. Okay.

1:21:16.130 --> 1:21:18.213
-[JC] Mom, what can I do?
-[Tina] JC, go get the keys.

1:21:18.296 --> 1:21:20.963
Autumn, open the door!
Open the back door!

1:21:33.546 --> 1:21:35.255
[doctor] Well, the infection is serious.

1:21:35.338 --> 1:21:38.630
You've got a softball-sized ulcer
that goes right down to the bone.

1:21:41.130 --> 1:21:43.463
This is extremely critical,

1:21:43.546 --> 1:21:44.671
life-threatening.

1:21:45.213 --> 1:21:47.713
I'll tell you,
if you had waited two more days,

1:21:47.796 --> 1:21:48.796
you could have died.

1:21:48.880 --> 1:21:51.671
My kid is dying
right in front of me. I don't even see it?

1:21:51.755 --> 1:21:54.296
[doctor] We've got her
on IV antibiotics now,

1:21:54.380 --> 1:21:56.088
but we need to operate right away.

1:21:57.005 --> 1:22:00.713
No, I've got two rodeos this weekend
and a shot at The American.

1:22:00.796 --> 1:22:01.838
Are you kidding me?

1:22:01.921 --> 1:22:06.755
This infection will kill you
if we don't treat it now.

1:22:07.338 --> 1:22:11.005
You'll need intensive wound care
and be on long-term antibiotics.

1:22:11.463 --> 1:22:12.421
No riding.

1:22:12.505 --> 1:22:15.463
What? No, then I'm not doing it.
I'm not doing it.

1:22:17.796 --> 1:22:19.588
Can I talk to my daughter alone, please?

1:22:21.546 --> 1:22:22.505
Good luck.

1:22:25.838 --> 1:22:26.755
[sniffles]

1:22:28.296 --> 1:22:29.671
[Tina] Do you want to die?

1:22:30.296 --> 1:22:32.880
Let me know now,
and I'll get ready to bury my child,

1:22:32.963 --> 1:22:33.963
because this...

1:22:35.130 --> 1:22:36.796
I can't go through this again.

1:22:36.880 --> 1:22:37.713
I won't.

1:22:38.505 --> 1:22:40.588
I am not strong enough.

1:22:41.171 --> 1:22:42.755
So if you wanna kill yourself,

1:22:42.838 --> 1:22:45.171
you're gonna put me
in that box right next to you.

1:22:47.713 --> 1:22:49.171
I don't wanna die.

1:22:50.963 --> 1:22:52.796
Why the hell did you not tell me?

1:22:53.380 --> 1:22:55.671
Just don't make me stop.

1:22:55.755 --> 1:22:57.463
Am, you just have to know
your limits.

1:22:57.546 --> 1:22:59.755
No! It's all gonna go away!

1:23:03.171 --> 1:23:04.963

Everything changed in that one moment.

1:23:10.296 --> 1:23:14.630
But then, I was me again.
I was riding.

1:23:15.630 --> 1:23:18.046
And I was just afraid

1:23:18.130 --> 1:23:19.630
that if I told you,

1:23:20.380 --> 1:23:23.921
that if you knew, it would all go away.

1:23:24.213 --> 1:23:27.880
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

1:23:28.380 --> 1:23:29.713
It's okay, my baby.

1:23:30.630 --> 1:23:31.463
It's okay. Come here.

1:33:35.588 --> 1:33:37.130
Steady, boy.

1:33:38.213 --> 1:33:39.338
You're all right.

1:33:40.963 --> 1:33:42.671
It's just a bigger crowd,

1:33:42.755 --> 1:33:44.880
but it's the same thing we always do.

1:33:46.755 --> 1:33:47.838
Listen to it.

1:33:47.921 --> 1:33:49.463
[crowd cheers]

1:34:04.130 --> 1:34:05.546
[announcer] Ladies and gents,

1:34:06.380 --> 1:34:09.005
we have a Fan Favorite coming up.

1:34:09.088 --> 1:34:11.921
She's beaten incredible odds to get here.

1:34:12.005 --> 1:34:14.755
She's got a heart as big as Texas,

1:34:14.963 --> 1:34:17.671
Amberley Snyder.

1:34:18.921 --> 1:34:20.130
Go, Amberley!

1:34:22.213 --> 1:34:23.046
Go get 'em!

1:34:25.671 --> 1:34:28.046
Power, you and me.

1:34:30.046 --> 1:34:33.880
[Amberley] Attitude is a little thing
that makes a big difference.

1:34:34.713 --> 1:34:41.338
I realize maybe I won't have control
over every situation in my life.

1:34:41.421 --> 1:34:45.005
Maybe I don't get to make every decision.

1:34:45.671 --> 1:34:50.671
But when I wake up in the morning,
I get to decide my attitude.

1:34:50.755 --> 1:34:52.338
Today is our day.

1:35:04.963 --> 1:35:08.296
[Amberley] And if that's the only decision
I get to make that day...

1:35:14.380 --> 1:35:16.421
I better make it a good one.

1:35:19.921 --> 1:35:22.213
Because with the right attitude,

1:35:22.296 --> 1:35:24.130
who knows what you can achieve?

1:35:28.671 --> 1:35:29.505
Yeah!

1:35:43.588 --> 1:35:48.213
[announcer] Wow!
What a run! 15.369 seconds.

1:35:48.296 --> 1:35:53.255
I can't believe what we just watched.
I mean, that was amazing.

1:35:53.338 --> 1:35:58.130
That puts Amberley Snyder up on the board
with some of the very best in rodeo.

1:35:59.296 --> 1:36:01.838
[Amberley] When the doctors asked
what my goals were,

1:36:01.921 --> 1:36:04.838
I said, "Walk. Ride. Rodeo."

1:36:06.088 --> 1:36:07.630
I got the last two.

1:36:08.380 --> 1:36:10.130
About that first one...

1:36:11.088 --> 1:36:12.296
maybe one day.

1:36:15.546 --> 1:36:18.088
[female announcer] ...around the second
barrel. It's just perfect.

1:36:18.171 --> 1:36:20.005
[male announcer]
She's perfect around three.

1:36:20.713 --> 1:36:22.838
Here comes Amberley Snyder,

1:36:22.921 --> 1:36:26.088
and she's gonna be amongst them
with a 15.369.

1:36:27.255 --> 1:36:30.255
I'm telling you what.
She played at a pro level here, girls.

1:36:31.005 --> 1:36:34.796
[female announcer] Getting a standing
ovation here at AT&amp;T Stadium.
