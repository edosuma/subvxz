WEBVTT

00:03.137 --> 00:06.072
(theme music playing)

00:19.687 --> 00:24.558
NARRATOR:
Man lives in the sunlit world

00:24.558 --> 00:29.018
of what he believes
to be reality.

00:30.531 --> 00:33.968
But... there is,

00:33.968 --> 00:38.505
unseen by most, an underworld.

00:38.505 --> 00:42.176
A place that is just as real

00:42.176 --> 00:46.280
but not as brightly lit.

00:46.280 --> 00:49.044
A dark side.

01:01.295 --> 01:02.429
(footsteps)

01:02.429 --> 01:05.265
MAN (in distance):
Good God! How much further?

01:05.265 --> 01:08.257
Algernon? Algernon?

01:09.570 --> 01:11.405
Algie, where are...? Algie!

01:11.405 --> 01:14.742
What are you doing all the way
up here on the third floor?

01:14.742 --> 01:16.243
(chuckles):
Harry.

01:16.243 --> 01:18.512
I brought a new present
for your collection.

01:18.512 --> 01:20.014
It's a housewarming present.

01:20.014 --> 01:21.148
(Algernon chuckles)

01:21.148 --> 01:22.650
(Harry sighs exhaustedly)

01:22.650 --> 01:26.286
Now, where is that drink
you promised me?

01:26.286 --> 01:28.722
(Harry panting)

01:28.722 --> 01:30.324
Ah.

01:30.324 --> 01:34.194
So, this is it, huh?

01:34.194 --> 01:37.998
This is the infamous
Jackson Townhouse.

01:37.998 --> 01:40.200
This is it.

01:40.200 --> 01:43.704
After all these years,
it's mine.

01:43.704 --> 01:45.472
Algernon Colesbury,

01:45.472 --> 01:47.541
photographer of spirits
and apparitions,

01:47.541 --> 01:49.343
is now the proud owner

01:49.343 --> 01:52.646
of New Haven's
most celebrated haunted house.

01:52.646 --> 01:53.947
What'd it set you back?

01:53.947 --> 01:55.416
What do you think?

01:55.416 --> 01:57.418
Well, there can't have been
too many takers

01:57.418 --> 02:00.187
for a house with the hellish
history this one's had, right?

02:00.187 --> 02:01.922
(chuckles):
Exactly.

02:01.922 --> 02:05.693
But don't tell me you believe
any of those legends, Harry.

02:05.693 --> 02:08.062
Not the ghost stories, no.

02:08.062 --> 02:09.897
But the things that went on here

02:09.897 --> 02:12.199
while old Henry Jackson
was still alive

02:12.199 --> 02:14.868
were certainly peculiar.

02:14.868 --> 02:16.603
Orgies...

02:16.603 --> 02:18.038
torture...

02:18.038 --> 02:20.374
suicide.

02:20.374 --> 02:22.943
Maybe you shouldn't have
bought this place, Algie.

02:22.943 --> 02:25.846
You can almost...
smell the evil.

02:25.846 --> 02:28.371
It's perfect for what
I have in mind.

02:30.417 --> 02:34.288
Mm. Those are my best, I think.

02:34.288 --> 02:36.290
The ones even you,
the supreme rationalist,

02:36.290 --> 02:38.592
haven't managed
to completely debunk.

02:38.592 --> 02:41.462
Algie, I've said it before
and I'll say it again--

02:41.462 --> 02:43.530
whatever these images are
that you've collected

02:43.530 --> 02:45.065
over the last 20 years,

02:45.065 --> 02:47.835
they are not photographic
evidence of ghosts!

02:47.835 --> 02:49.336
For the thousandth time, Harry,

02:49.336 --> 02:51.405
"spirits" or "entities"

02:51.405 --> 02:53.807
or "manifestations
of ectoplasmic being,"

02:53.807 --> 02:55.676
but not "ghosts."

02:55.676 --> 02:58.412
I've spent my life
in pursuit of them.

02:58.412 --> 03:00.748
Oh, I know what
you think, Harry.

03:00.748 --> 03:03.350
You've told me
over and over again.

03:03.350 --> 03:05.552
You've even said it
in newspaper articles.

03:05.552 --> 03:08.322
You know I'd love to believe
that, after we die,

03:08.322 --> 03:10.324
we continue on!

03:10.324 --> 03:13.360
But why is it that whenever
any of you fellas

03:13.360 --> 03:15.996
takes a picture of a ghost--
a spirit--

03:15.996 --> 03:19.399
or a UFO or a sea serpent,
for that matter,

03:19.399 --> 03:20.801
this is what we get?

03:20.801 --> 03:22.402
Grainy shadow images,

03:22.402 --> 03:24.605
indistinct outlines,
blobs of light.

03:24.605 --> 03:27.775
They could be anything,
for heaven's sake.

03:27.775 --> 03:31.912
Never a clear, definitive,
irrefutable image.

03:31.912 --> 03:33.413
Never any proof.

03:33.413 --> 03:34.982
You've got a point, Harry.

03:34.982 --> 03:36.917
I've never denied it.

03:36.917 --> 03:40.187
You know I've struggled with
that problem my whole life,

03:40.187 --> 03:42.923
but now, old friend...

03:42.923 --> 03:47.161
I think I've finally
found the answer.

03:47.161 --> 03:48.862
In the history of photography,

03:48.862 --> 03:51.799
there's never been
anything like it.

03:51.799 --> 03:55.135
You see, Harry, the energy level
of the average spirit

03:55.135 --> 03:57.437
is extremely low,
so low that most

03:57.437 --> 03:59.540
aren't even visible
to the naked eye,

03:59.540 --> 04:00.641
let alone the camera.

04:00.641 --> 04:02.009
I have also discovered

04:02.009 --> 04:04.311
that the camera,
for some reason,

04:04.311 --> 04:06.914
places an additional drain
on the spirit's energies.

04:06.914 --> 04:09.583
Uh, being photographed
is unpleasant for them,

04:09.583 --> 04:10.818
even painful.

04:10.818 --> 04:12.686
I quite share the feeling.

04:12.686 --> 04:15.956
I invariably find it humiliating
to be photographed.

04:15.956 --> 04:17.591
It may even be lethal.

04:17.591 --> 04:19.426
That's why any photography

04:19.426 --> 04:22.229
in a place where spirit activity
has been recorded

04:22.229 --> 04:25.098
often causes a halt
in the phenomenon altogether.

04:25.098 --> 04:27.601
The spirit, or spirits, flee,

04:27.601 --> 04:31.038
their energies drained...
and dispersed.

04:31.038 --> 04:32.471
Get to the point!

04:33.841 --> 04:35.542
This...

04:35.542 --> 04:38.670
is the point, Harry.

04:40.881 --> 04:43.016
Very impressive.

04:43.016 --> 04:44.484
What is it?

04:44.484 --> 04:48.155
ALGERNON:
I call it... a spirit attractor.

04:48.155 --> 04:50.724
It's going to help me
to take the world's first

04:50.724 --> 04:53.560
technically perfect photograph
of a spirit entity,

04:53.560 --> 04:57.164
and capture the clear,
definitive,

04:57.164 --> 05:01.535
irrefutable image you speak of.

05:01.535 --> 05:04.338
Aren't you gonna ask me
how it works?

05:04.338 --> 05:05.772
I don't have to ask,

05:05.772 --> 05:08.242
because you're going
to tell me anyway.

05:08.242 --> 05:10.911
It's simple, Harry.

05:10.911 --> 05:13.447
Beautifully simple.

05:13.447 --> 05:16.316
This machine generates
an energy field

05:16.316 --> 05:17.751
conducive to spirits.

05:17.751 --> 05:20.087
It actually nourishes them.

05:20.087 --> 05:22.923
Then with the attractor
counteracting

05:22.923 --> 05:24.558
the camera's drain

05:24.558 --> 05:28.358
on the spirit,
the spirit can be photographed.

05:29.563 --> 05:32.499
This really is too much, Algie.

05:32.499 --> 05:34.334
Even for you.

05:34.334 --> 05:36.103
I thought you'd congratulate me.

05:36.103 --> 05:37.671
Congratulate you?!

05:37.671 --> 05:39.840
I think I'm only
seeing you clearly

05:39.840 --> 05:42.876
for the first time
in all the years I've known you.

05:42.876 --> 05:45.045
This obsession has
dangerously eroded

05:45.045 --> 05:46.914
your sense of reality.

05:46.914 --> 05:49.283
That's what the skeptics
said about Galileo.

05:49.283 --> 05:51.785
I should have encouraged you
to get married, Algie.

05:51.785 --> 05:54.788
A good woman would've kept you
more in touch with reality.

05:54.788 --> 05:57.257
This is my reality, damn it.
It's my life!

05:57.257 --> 05:58.859
All right, all right.

05:58.859 --> 06:01.228
Listen, Theresa and I are
going out for dinner.

06:01.228 --> 06:02.596
Why don't you join us?

06:02.596 --> 06:03.830
You don't believe me.

06:03.830 --> 06:04.932
How about it?

06:04.932 --> 06:07.401
Over a leisurely dinner,
we could catch up.

06:07.401 --> 06:09.392
Theresa's missed you.

06:10.570 --> 06:12.239
You don't believe me.

06:12.239 --> 06:14.908
No, I do. I do, really.

06:14.908 --> 06:17.644
Put this stuff aside,
just for tonight.

06:17.644 --> 06:20.514
Come and have dinner
with us, Algie, come on.

06:20.514 --> 06:21.982
Not tonight, Harry, thanks.

06:21.982 --> 06:23.984
I've got to get started.

06:23.984 --> 06:26.086
Yes, I suppose you do.

06:26.086 --> 06:29.723
Thanks for dropping by
to see me, Harry.

06:29.723 --> 06:32.055
Good-bye, Algie.

06:44.471 --> 06:46.803
(whirring, clicking)

06:52.379 --> 06:53.714
Time: 4:00 am.

06:53.714 --> 06:57.484
It is now 12 hours since
I switched on the attractor.

06:57.484 --> 07:00.253
So far, I've observed
no unusual phenomena,

07:00.253 --> 07:04.691
but I believe I can expect
some activity at any time.

07:04.691 --> 07:06.793
The original owner
of Jackson Townhouse,

07:06.793 --> 07:10.931
Emmerich Jackson,
took his own life here in 1933.

07:10.931 --> 07:13.600
Since that time,
there have been numerous reports

07:13.600 --> 07:16.136
of an apparition in the house.

07:16.136 --> 07:17.971
This apparition is...

07:17.971 --> 07:22.709
invariably described
as a veiled woman in white.

07:22.709 --> 07:26.346
This is the spirit
I hope to photograph,

07:26.346 --> 07:29.282
and, if possible, to identify.

07:29.282 --> 07:32.352
I believe her
to be the same spirit

07:32.352 --> 07:36.345
Emmerich Jackson mentions
in his last will and testament.

07:40.127 --> 07:43.296
"Furthermore, I swear
on my immortal soul,

07:43.296 --> 07:46.266
"damned though it is,
that I was compelled

07:46.266 --> 07:49.503
"to the obscene and sinful acts
committed in this house

07:49.503 --> 07:52.773
"by the devious and malevolent
spirit of a woman

07:52.773 --> 07:56.309
"who possessed me,
coerced me and seduced me

07:56.309 --> 07:58.345
"into all that I have done.

07:58.345 --> 07:59.679
"With death

07:59.679 --> 08:02.749
"as my only means
of escape from her evil,

08:02.749 --> 08:05.452
"I hereby take my own life.

08:05.452 --> 08:10.057
I pray that God, and man,
will forgive me."

08:10.057 --> 08:13.560
(spirit attractor
continues whirring quietly)

08:13.560 --> 08:16.096
I'm now going
to attempt to contact

08:16.096 --> 08:18.465
the soul of Emmerich Jackson,

08:18.465 --> 08:21.201
using my own slight gifts
as a medium

08:21.201 --> 08:23.669
with the aid of a Ouija board.

08:24.871 --> 08:27.374
I call upon the soul

08:27.374 --> 08:31.978
of Emmerich Jackson
in the name of scientific truth.

08:31.978 --> 08:33.613
(attractor continues whirring)

08:33.613 --> 08:36.116
Are you there...

08:36.116 --> 08:38.107
Emmerich Jackson?

08:41.154 --> 08:42.451
Yes.

08:44.558 --> 08:47.494
Time: 4:06.

08:47.494 --> 08:51.430
Contact with the soul
of Emmerich Jackson established.

08:53.066 --> 08:55.728
Will you materialize?

08:58.939 --> 09:00.304
No?

09:03.076 --> 09:05.879
Emmerich Jackson...

09:05.879 --> 09:10.217
can you tell me anything about
the malevolent female spirit

09:10.217 --> 09:13.386
said to walk the halls
of this house to this very day,

09:13.386 --> 09:16.378
the one you say possessed you?

09:20.227 --> 09:21.027
(whispers):
Yes.

09:21.027 --> 09:23.964
I knew it.

09:23.964 --> 09:26.956
Can you tell me... her name?

09:29.503 --> 09:31.300
L...

09:32.339 --> 09:33.567
E...

09:34.908 --> 09:36.076
N...

09:36.076 --> 09:38.979
O...

09:38.979 --> 09:40.247
R...

09:40.247 --> 09:41.815
E.

09:41.815 --> 09:43.250
Lenore.

09:43.250 --> 09:46.344
Her name's Lenore.

09:49.923 --> 09:52.125
E...

09:52.125 --> 09:53.149
W...

09:54.194 --> 09:55.491
A...

09:57.998 --> 09:59.499
R...

09:59.499 --> 10:00.667
E.

10:00.667 --> 10:02.202
(laughs):
Beware.

10:02.202 --> 10:04.838
Oh, I am in no danger,
Mr. Jackson.

10:04.838 --> 10:07.374
I merely wish to photograph
this spirit.

10:07.374 --> 10:10.434
(chalk scraping)

10:12.212 --> 10:14.047
Oh, unbelievable.

10:14.047 --> 10:17.039
(attractor continues whirring)

10:18.318 --> 10:20.479
Are you still there?

10:21.988 --> 10:25.458
Emmerich Jackson,
are you still there?

10:25.458 --> 10:28.261
Don't go, please--
I have so many more questions.

10:28.261 --> 10:29.922
Mr. Jack...

10:37.904 --> 10:40.473
(panting softly)

10:40.473 --> 10:42.909
Contact with the soul
of Emmerich Jackson

10:42.909 --> 10:46.572
terminated at... 4:08.

10:51.918 --> 10:53.579
(sighs)

10:55.689 --> 10:56.951
(sighs)

10:59.492 --> 11:01.687
(phone ringing)

11:05.565 --> 11:08.168
Just a little over 26 hours

11:08.168 --> 11:12.372
since I first switched on
the attractor.

11:12.372 --> 11:14.507
Still no sign

11:14.507 --> 11:16.876
of the spirit Lenore.

11:16.876 --> 11:20.547
I've noticed an unfortunate
and unexpected side effect

11:20.547 --> 11:21.948
from the attractor.

11:21.948 --> 11:24.584
It seems an exposure
to its emanations

11:24.584 --> 11:27.487
drains the life energy
from living things.

11:27.487 --> 11:30.557
My own condition
and that of a plant

11:30.557 --> 11:33.560
which was healthy only yesterday
seems to bear that out.

11:33.560 --> 11:34.928
(whirring intensifies)

11:34.928 --> 11:36.555
Wait a minute here.

11:37.831 --> 11:39.165
There it is again.

11:39.165 --> 11:41.292
Electronic sensing devices
activated.

11:43.436 --> 11:44.960
(electronic tones
oscillating)

11:48.742 --> 11:51.506
(woman moaning in distance)

11:58.685 --> 12:00.553
Lenore?

12:00.553 --> 12:02.422
Is that you?

12:02.422 --> 12:05.725
You may come in, Lenore.

12:05.725 --> 12:08.387
The door is open to you.

12:11.564 --> 12:13.555
(wind whistling, gusting)

12:19.906 --> 12:22.409
The room door has just opened,

12:22.409 --> 12:25.412
then closed by itself.

12:25.412 --> 12:30.250
I believe the spirit
Emmerich Jackson called Lenore

12:30.250 --> 12:33.083
is now present in the room
with me.

12:34.254 --> 12:37.991
Incredible. One of my crystals
has just began to glow--

12:37.991 --> 12:40.323
an eerie, luminous glow.

12:43.096 --> 12:44.331
(intercom buzzer sounding)

12:44.331 --> 12:45.665
Damn!

12:45.665 --> 12:47.400
Who in blazes is it?!

12:47.400 --> 12:49.202
It's me-- Harry.

12:49.202 --> 12:51.227
(lock buzzing open)

12:57.644 --> 12:59.111
Algie...

13:00.146 --> 13:02.482
What's going on here?

13:02.482 --> 13:05.118
Algie... you look terrible.

13:05.118 --> 13:06.319
What's wrong?

13:06.319 --> 13:08.088
Nothing's wrong.
I couldn't be better.

13:08.088 --> 13:10.290
The experiment is going
beautifully.

13:10.290 --> 13:13.093
She's here... right now

13:13.093 --> 13:14.994
in this room with us.

13:14.994 --> 13:17.497
Who is?

13:17.497 --> 13:21.034
The spirit Emmerich Jackson
told me about.

13:21.034 --> 13:22.669
The one who haunts this house.

13:22.669 --> 13:24.771
He calls her... Lenore.

13:24.771 --> 13:27.374
I called you half a dozen times,
but you didn't answer.

13:27.374 --> 13:28.808
I was so worried about you.

13:28.808 --> 13:30.877
I haven't been taking any calls.
Too busy.

13:30.877 --> 13:32.078
This Lenore--

13:32.078 --> 13:33.980
you say Emmerich Jackson
told you about her?

13:33.980 --> 13:34.981
That's right.

13:34.981 --> 13:37.584
Emmerich Jackson is dead, Algie.

13:37.584 --> 13:40.320
I have it all here
on tape, Harry.

13:40.320 --> 13:42.822
I know it sounds fantastic,
but it's true-- listen.

13:42.822 --> 13:44.023
(footsteps)

13:44.023 --> 13:45.792
(woman moaning)

13:45.792 --> 13:46.960
You hear that?

13:46.960 --> 13:48.128
-(intercom buzzer sounds)
-ALGERNON: Damn!

13:48.128 --> 13:50.930
I believe she was on the verge
of materializing when you rang.

13:50.930 --> 13:52.098
That sounds to me like

13:52.098 --> 13:54.000
you're just getting clumsy
in your old age.

13:54.000 --> 13:55.502
It is not a rampaging ghost!

13:55.502 --> 13:56.836
Spirit, damn it, not ghost!

13:56.836 --> 13:58.471
She-She's still here, though.

13:58.471 --> 13:59.806
I can feel her.

13:59.806 --> 14:02.142
Listen, Algie,
you are not yourself.

14:02.142 --> 14:04.077
I mean it. You look ill.

14:04.077 --> 14:06.212
Now, turn that thing off
and get into bed.

14:06.212 --> 14:07.474
I'll call a doctor.

14:09.983 --> 14:10.972
Put down that phone!

14:12.118 --> 14:13.887
Algie,
listen to what you're saying!

14:13.887 --> 14:16.423
I know exactly what I'm saying
and what I'm doing.

14:16.423 --> 14:18.914
Good-bye, Harry!

14:22.662 --> 14:24.164
All right, do what you want.

14:24.164 --> 14:27.133
Kill yourself with this idiotic
experiment of yours.

14:27.133 --> 14:29.836
Spirit attractor, my eye.

14:29.836 --> 14:31.604
Where's your spirit, Algie?
Where?

14:31.604 --> 14:33.973
You've finally gone crazy.

14:33.973 --> 14:35.842
All right, all right, just go.

14:35.842 --> 14:37.310
I am going.

14:37.310 --> 14:39.446
Say my good-byes
to Lenore for me.

14:39.446 --> 14:40.914
I would myself,

14:40.914 --> 14:43.678
only I might say good night
to your armchair by mistake.

14:44.717 --> 14:45.775
(door slams)

14:49.456 --> 14:51.447
(clicking and whirring)

14:56.429 --> 14:59.762
(wailing)

15:04.471 --> 15:06.462
(wailing)

15:08.441 --> 15:10.577
(wailing continues)

15:10.577 --> 15:14.147
Lenore... it's you.

15:14.147 --> 15:16.049
You have come.

15:16.049 --> 15:18.040
(wailing continues)

15:19.619 --> 15:23.156
Time-- 11:33 pm.

15:23.156 --> 15:26.359
In the wake of a visit
from that idiot Bainbridge,

15:26.359 --> 15:31.231
the spirit Lenore has made
an auspicious entrance.

15:31.231 --> 15:33.290
(Lenore wailing)

15:34.901 --> 15:36.169
Lenore...

15:36.169 --> 15:38.404
I want to help you.

15:38.404 --> 15:40.940
To send you on.

15:40.940 --> 15:43.710
To release your troubled spirit
from this place.

15:43.710 --> 15:47.476
But to do that,
I need your help.

15:48.882 --> 15:51.117
I ask you now,

15:51.117 --> 15:53.119
does Emmerich Jackson

15:53.119 --> 15:55.221
say the truth about you?

15:55.221 --> 15:58.558
(groaning)

15:58.558 --> 16:01.094
(wailing)

16:01.094 --> 16:02.896
It's-It's all right, Lenore.

16:02.896 --> 16:04.631
-It's all right.
-(wai|ing continues)

16:04.631 --> 16:08.568
Now, will you please
come over here

16:08.568 --> 16:11.137
so that
I may take your photograph?

16:11.137 --> 16:12.672
It would help me,

16:12.672 --> 16:16.039
and help me to help you.

16:18.444 --> 16:20.071
Look this way.

16:24.183 --> 16:25.985
(camera shutter clicks)

16:25.985 --> 16:27.976
(wailing)

16:30.690 --> 16:33.626
Inconsolable girl.

16:33.626 --> 16:35.261
(wailing continues)

16:35.261 --> 16:37.330
There, there.

16:37.330 --> 16:39.799
You don't have to cry anymore.

16:39.799 --> 16:40.800
(wailing continues)

16:40.800 --> 16:42.529
YOU can move on HOW.

16:43.603 --> 16:46.372
(guttural hiss)

16:46.372 --> 16:48.074
Lenore?

16:48.074 --> 16:51.144
(eerie laughter)

16:51.144 --> 16:52.845
What's wrong with you?
What are you doing?

16:52.845 --> 16:54.981
Come to me!

16:54.981 --> 16:57.250
Like Emmerich Jackson!

16:57.250 --> 16:58.251
Stop!

16:58.251 --> 17:02.355
And all the others before.

17:02.355 --> 17:04.023
(cackling)

17:04.023 --> 17:06.092
What have I done?!

17:06.092 --> 17:07.889
(laughs)

17:13.166 --> 17:13.996
(gasps)

17:16.502 --> 17:18.493
(wailing)

17:30.116 --> 17:32.175
(sighs)

17:35.655 --> 17:37.680
(attractor whirring)

17:39.058 --> 17:41.049
(bell tolling, birds singing,
children chattering)

17:45.898 --> 17:47.934
(sighs)

17:47.934 --> 17:51.233
Hm! I feel fantastic!

17:58.478 --> 18:00.002
Ah.

18:03.583 --> 18:05.218
(busy signal)

18:05.218 --> 18:07.553
Huh. Hello, Operator. Op...

18:07.553 --> 18:08.721
(busy signal continues)

18:08.721 --> 18:10.823
Hmm. Have to have
that thing looked at.

18:10.823 --> 18:13.792
Haven't been the same
since Ma Bell's breakup.

18:17.430 --> 18:19.022
(camera shutter clicks)

18:20.066 --> 18:22.502
What in the name of heaven?

18:22.502 --> 18:24.671
Who are you?

18:24.671 --> 18:27.340
What do you want?

18:27.340 --> 18:29.008
Harry.

18:29.008 --> 18:30.309
You did it, Algie.

18:30.309 --> 18:31.844
You really did it!

18:31.844 --> 18:33.946
Your spirit attractor worked!

18:33.946 --> 18:35.281
It worked?

18:35.281 --> 18:37.150
It worked!

18:37.150 --> 18:39.152
Where's the photograph, Harry?

18:39.152 --> 18:40.517
Show it to me.

18:41.954 --> 18:43.546
Ah.

18:45.792 --> 18:48.628
Ah, look at it.

18:48.628 --> 18:51.062
It's magnificent!

18:52.231 --> 18:54.233
Harry?

18:54.233 --> 18:55.535
Irrefutable.

18:55.535 --> 18:58.538
Absolutely irrefutable.

18:58.538 --> 19:01.340
I'm sorry I said
you were crazy, Algie.

19:01.340 --> 19:03.643
I was crazy not
to believe in you.

19:03.643 --> 19:05.278
No. Think nothing of it.

19:05.278 --> 19:08.815
This makes all the difference
in the world.

19:08.815 --> 19:11.217
HARRY:
So you can move on, Algie.

19:11.217 --> 19:12.684
You've done it.

19:14.020 --> 19:16.355
Move on.
What do you mean, move on?

19:16.355 --> 19:19.158
There's been a whole team
of parapsychologists

19:19.158 --> 19:22.261
in here for the last few days
looking for you, Algie.

19:22.261 --> 19:24.797
They finally gave up,
but I didn't. I came back.

19:24.797 --> 19:26.766
Oh, the suit's
just to protect me

19:26.766 --> 19:29.235
from the side effects
of your machine, that's all.

19:29.235 --> 19:32.102
Bainbridge,
what are you talking about?

19:33.139 --> 19:35.208
Algie...

19:35.208 --> 19:37.076
don't you understand?

19:37.076 --> 19:39.679
Understand what?

19:39.679 --> 19:41.814
Please, Harry, be direct.

19:41.814 --> 19:44.550
Nothing ever stopped you before.

19:44.550 --> 19:46.419
The newspaper, Algie.

19:46.419 --> 19:48.410
On the table.

19:50.590 --> 19:54.327
"Algernon Colesbury,
famed spirit photographer,

19:54.327 --> 19:56.162
"died three days ago
of a stroke,

19:56.162 --> 19:58.397
"just after taking the first

19:58.397 --> 20:00.967
"technically perfect photograph
of a spirit

20:00.967 --> 20:03.336
"in the living room
of his New Haven home,

20:03.336 --> 20:06.005
"reputed to be the city's
most infamous...

20:06.005 --> 20:09.270
haunted... house."

20:11.010 --> 20:13.001
What do you know?

20:14.247 --> 20:15.782
I'm dead.

20:15.782 --> 20:17.950
Buck up, Harry.

20:17.950 --> 20:19.585
Don't look so sad.

20:19.585 --> 20:22.054
I'm dead.

20:22.054 --> 20:24.323
Think of all the adventures

20:24.323 --> 20:26.587
waiting for me
on the other side.

20:28.227 --> 20:30.196
You have enough pictures
of me, Harry?

20:30.196 --> 20:31.754
Enough.

20:33.966 --> 20:36.730
Mind if... I do the honors?

20:43.709 --> 20:45.734
(switch clicks, whirring stops)

20:46.979 --> 20:48.981
Good-bye, Harry...

20:48.981 --> 20:51.350
old friend.

20:51.350 --> 20:54.554
We'll meet again one day.

20:54.554 --> 20:56.988
Don't worry about that.

21:18.344 --> 21:22.148
NARRATOR:
The dark side is always there.

21:22.148 --> 21:24.684
Waiting for us to enter.

21:24.684 --> 21:27.920
Waiting to enter us.

21:27.920 --> 21:34.655
Until next time, try
to enjoy the daylight.
