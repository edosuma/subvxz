00:58.641 --> 00:59.641
The end.

01:00.226 --> 01:01.311
One more?

01:02.187 --> 01:03.187
Hayden.

01:04.438 --> 01:06.191
You said "one more" three books ago.

01:06.480 --> 01:08.980
Why you gotta harsh my buzz, Mom?

01:09.736 --> 01:13.615
In bed in five, four, three...

01:15.742 --> 01:16.743
Good night.

01:18.119 --> 01:19.746
- Sorry.
- Don't be.

01:19.820 --> 01:21.320
The best part of having a little sister

01:21.330 --> 01:23.416
is teaching her how to give attitude.

01:23.541 --> 01:24.667
Do you have a sister?

01:25.001 --> 01:26.878
- Two.
- What are they like?

01:27.629 --> 01:28.922
Oh.

01:29.214 --> 01:32.050
Sassy, beautiful, full of attitude.

01:32.634 --> 01:33.718
At least they were.

01:34.135 --> 01:36.721
I've no idea what they're like now.
We haven't spoken in years.

01:36.800 --> 01:37.972
I'm sorry.

01:38.223 --> 01:40.767
Don't be. My family is toxic.

01:41.518 --> 01:42.811
Your father ever tell you that?

01:42.977 --> 01:44.706
Dad thinks it's unfair
to talk about people

01:44.707 --> 01:46.067
unless they can defend themselves.

01:47.357 --> 01:50.026
Your father's a good man.
Always has been.

01:53.530 --> 01:54.530
Hey.

01:56.991 --> 01:57.991
What's wrong?

01:58.650 --> 01:59.702
Nothing.

01:59.994 --> 02:00.994
Talk to me.

02:02.914 --> 02:03.914
What is it?

02:04.916 --> 02:06.209
You can ask me anything.

02:09.169 --> 02:10.295
Why did you leave him?

02:13.258 --> 02:14.509
And why did you leave me?

02:21.266 --> 02:23.143
I never intended to leave you.

02:24.602 --> 02:25.603
I swear.

02:27.105 --> 02:28.982
I just wanted some space...

02:29.524 --> 02:30.525
clear my head...

02:31.317 --> 02:32.902
feel like my own person again.

02:33.778 --> 02:37.448
When I left, it was... it was only
supposed to be for a few days.

02:38.658 --> 02:40.326
That turned into a year.

02:42.162 --> 02:43.246
Then three.

02:46.958 --> 02:48.793
I can't believe I did that to you.

02:52.922 --> 02:55.675
I've been tortured thinking
about you needing me

02:55.758 --> 02:57.468
and me not being there for you.

02:58.136 --> 03:01.514
I am so, so sorry, Monse.

03:03.641 --> 03:04.641
Hey.

03:08.813 --> 03:10.273
We found each other.

03:11.316 --> 03:13.109
That's all that matters. Truly.

03:14.027 --> 03:15.570
Let's just move forward, okay?

03:16.946 --> 03:19.019
We only have a few days
left before I leave,

03:19.020 --> 03:20.260
so let's make the most of them.

03:21.743 --> 03:22.994
What if you don't leave?

03:23.536 --> 03:25.330
- What do you mean?
- Stay.

03:26.956 --> 03:27.956
Live with me.

03:37.717 --> 03:38.760
On the house.

03:40.345 --> 03:42.138
Thank you for your hard work, officers.

03:42.222 --> 03:43.556
- You bet.
- Stay safe.

03:44.557 --> 03:46.476
Would you, uh, mind hitting the tables?

03:46.559 --> 03:47.977
- They need a wipe.
- On it.

03:49.520 --> 03:52.232
Hey, when's Paula's next shift?
I haven't seen her in a while.

03:52.357 --> 03:54.359
And you won't be. She didn't work out.

03:55.818 --> 03:57.111
Pick up, it's Jamal!

03:57.195 --> 03:58.200
Pick up, it's Jamal!

03:58.220 --> 03:59.300
Pick up...

03:59.322 --> 04:00.490
Hey. Where are you?

04:00.570 --> 04:02.180
Ruby's. I'm gonna be late.

04:02.190 --> 04:03.199
How late?

04:03.200 --> 04:06.162
The truce is over, shit's
getting thick, and I gotta go.

04:07.914 --> 04:09.540
Woman, where have you been?

04:09.958 --> 04:11.084
In my room.

04:11.167 --> 04:12.794
Yeah, Jamal, chill. The money's safe.

04:12.877 --> 04:14.212
For the moment. Listen.

04:14.420 --> 04:17.173
How much money do we have left to
move, and how much left to clean?

04:17.464 --> 04:18.591
Ninety-eight is clean.

04:18.757 --> 04:20.009
Oh, so we're halfway there.

04:20.218 --> 04:21.719
No, $98.

04:21.803 --> 04:25.473
Minus expenses for gas,
meds, and lunch at Panera.

04:26.015 --> 04:27.850
Actually, you owe me $42.

04:27.934 --> 04:28.977
We owe you?

04:29.060 --> 04:30.645
That $98 only went so far.

04:30.728 --> 04:32.939
You're spending the clean money?

04:33.523 --> 04:36.818
Well, I'm not about to
spend the dirty kind.

04:37.120 --> 04:38.240
Ruby!

04:38.695 --> 04:40.989
Put your abuelita in check.

04:41.364 --> 04:43.032
You think I could put her in...

04:43.616 --> 04:44.616
A soda?

04:45.030 --> 04:46.680
You bought a soda with your sandwich?

04:46.700 --> 04:48.030
Don't you know Panera water's free?

04:48.040 --> 04:49.280
How is it even possible

04:49.622 --> 04:51.666
that you've made nothing
in the last month?

04:52.125 --> 04:53.793
I made two dresses. It's not nothing.

04:53.876 --> 04:57.088
And it's slow right now. And my
hands hurt 'cause of the curse.

04:57.171 --> 04:58.190
The curse?

04:58.214 --> 05:00.341
Nothing! She's scapegoating.

05:04.304 --> 05:05.471
Take it! I'm out!

05:06.264 --> 05:08.516
I want nothing to do with
this dinero malvado.

05:10.310 --> 05:11.330
Fine!

05:11.430 --> 05:13.139
Well, don't come crying back to me

05:13.140 --> 05:15.481
for your 35% when we prove you wrong!

05:18.067 --> 05:19.277
Thirty five percent?

05:20.028 --> 05:21.988
- You gave her 35?
- Gave.

05:22.447 --> 05:23.865
As in past tense.

05:24.615 --> 05:26.909
- Now we don't owe her anything.
- Oh, yeah. Lucky us.

05:27.201 --> 05:29.912
We have a 100% stake in
money we can't spend!

05:30.830 --> 05:31.831
What are we gonna do now?

05:33.708 --> 05:34.708
Bye, Cooper.

05:39.130 --> 05:40.590
Brian, thanks for everything.

05:40.673 --> 05:43.051
I really hope I haven't been
any trouble or an imposition.

05:43.134 --> 05:45.261
No! Zero imposition.

05:45.511 --> 05:46.971
We love you, Monse.

05:47.050 --> 05:48.580
From week one, we've been
trying to figure out

05:48.600 --> 05:50.183
how to make this permanent.

05:50.308 --> 05:52.018
Your mum told me she asked you.

05:52.226 --> 05:55.104
And I know it's a lot for you
and your dad to think about,

05:55.188 --> 05:56.939
but if you do decide to stay...

05:57.065 --> 05:59.108
... nothing would make us happier.

05:59.192 --> 06:01.986
Okay, both kids are in the car.

06:02.070 --> 06:04.072
Thanks, babe. I'll see
you in a few days.

06:04.655 --> 06:06.074
I hope.

06:06.157 --> 06:07.784
- Love you.
- Love you too.

06:10.953 --> 06:13.414
And spring break begins.

06:13.915 --> 06:15.833
When are Sahara and Jane coming over?

06:15.917 --> 06:17.543
Can I just say that I love the fact

06:17.627 --> 06:19.545
that you've clicked with
my best friend's girls?

06:19.796 --> 06:21.547
Shall we do a mother-daughter spa day?

06:24.509 --> 06:26.469
- What's wrong? You okay?
- Yeah.

06:26.719 --> 06:30.181
I was just thinking about what it'd
be like to live here, for real.

06:30.765 --> 06:33.351
- Really?
- Yeah, it's tempting but...

06:34.394 --> 06:35.645
I really miss my friends.

06:36.729 --> 06:39.440
That's an easy fix. Have
them come stay tonight.

06:40.066 --> 06:42.568
You guys can have the house,
catch up, talk it out.

06:43.444 --> 06:45.738
I can step out to work.
I have a lot I can do.

06:45.822 --> 06:48.783
You really want to leave a bunch
of teenagers alone in your house?

06:49.033 --> 06:50.033
Why not?

06:51.536 --> 06:54.622
The last time that you had
my chicken, you loved it.

06:55.180 --> 06:56.249
So you say.

06:56.332 --> 06:58.251
Okay. Okay, wise-ass, I'll prove it.

06:58.960 --> 07:00.420
I got some more sauce in the back.

07:00.503 --> 07:01.921
All right.

07:03.548 --> 07:05.883
- How can I help you, young man?
- Cesar working here?

07:05.967 --> 07:07.802
Yeah, he's just working in the back.

07:13.808 --> 07:16.519
These gangs... Nothing's
off limits. He's not safe.

07:16.894 --> 07:18.855
If the Prophets know that
he works here, then...

07:19.313 --> 07:21.315
then they know that he's
staying with me too.

07:22.191 --> 07:23.276
We have to hide him.

07:26.737 --> 07:27.947
They asked me to stay.

07:28.030 --> 07:29.340
This whole month feels like a dream

07:29.360 --> 07:31.200
and I don't know if
I'm ready to wake up.

07:31.701 --> 07:34.454
But I also don't want to leave my
dad. Or you. What should I do?

07:34.537 --> 07:35.955
There is no question.

07:36.038 --> 07:37.038
Stay!

07:37.350 --> 07:38.499
You serious?

07:38.580 --> 07:40.020
You're just gonna give me up that easily

07:40.040 --> 07:41.252
with no discussion or debate?

07:41.335 --> 07:42.420
What's there to debate?

07:42.503 --> 07:45.923
You're living in a baller house
with expensive fits, and it's safe.

07:46.924 --> 07:49.177
Yeah. The money's
definitely better off here.

07:50.928 --> 07:53.222
What do you mean, the money is
definitely better off here?

07:53.890 --> 07:55.099
Did you bring the money?

07:55.975 --> 07:58.936
No. No, I can't keep the money.
What happened to abuelita?

07:59.020 --> 08:00.897
- The old bag scammed us.
- Ugh!

08:00.980 --> 08:03.191
What? I can say "old
bag." She's my grandma.

08:03.274 --> 08:05.024
Monse, we just need a
secure place to store it

08:05.025 --> 08:06.499
until we can work out
a new plan, pronto.

08:06.500 --> 08:08.237
But I invited some friends over.

08:08.321 --> 08:10.531
Well, un-invite them!

08:10.907 --> 08:12.325
We don't want to impose.

08:12.408 --> 08:15.369
This is just a drop off, so
the food doesn't go to waste.

08:15.453 --> 08:17.330
Aww, you guys! Thank you!

08:17.740 --> 08:19.040
Sorry for the change of plans, but we...

08:19.050 --> 08:20.958
But we insist you join us.

08:21.042 --> 08:23.669
But I thought we needed to
discuss that thing. Privately.

08:23.753 --> 08:25.046
Don't be so possessive, Monse.

08:26.005 --> 08:28.382
We get to see you all
the time. Let's eat.

08:28.966 --> 08:32.178
This is a beautiful presentation
and I appreciate the artistry,

08:32.260 --> 08:34.722
but I'm not sure about
the protein involved.

08:34.804 --> 08:36.640
- Is there chicken in this?
- Just tuna.

08:36.724 --> 08:37.808
Why is it so red?

08:37.892 --> 08:39.101
It's raw.

08:39.268 --> 08:41.145
- Try the salmon roe.
- The huh?

08:41.437 --> 08:43.563
- Fish eggs.
- I can't, I can't.

08:43.648 --> 08:46.609
California roll? It's basic.
Just a little imitation crab.

08:47.610 --> 08:49.946
You'd think rich people would
spring for the real thing.

08:50.029 --> 08:51.029
I'll try it.

08:51.531 --> 08:52.615
I don't mind fishy.

08:59.080 --> 09:00.122
I got you.

09:00.206 --> 09:01.624
You get the butt.

09:02.208 --> 09:03.208
Unh-unh. I got you.

09:05.127 --> 09:06.963
Get the back. Get the butt.

09:11.509 --> 09:13.386
- This is exhausting.
- You can use your hands.

09:13.469 --> 09:15.680
You know what else you can
use your hands for? Pizza.

09:15.763 --> 09:19.267
Ooh! There's this really sick
truffle and cauliflower crust

09:19.350 --> 09:22.019
- from that place down the street.
- Let's get the blanco with kale.

09:22.103 --> 09:25.773
- Yes!
- No! No blanco, no kale! Just cheese!

09:25.856 --> 09:27.316
I'd love to try the truffle.

09:29.819 --> 09:32.947
Fine! We'll make a half-truffle
concession for you.

09:33.322 --> 09:35.116
Only 'cause you were shot.

09:35.199 --> 09:36.951
- You were shot?
- Almost died.

09:37.034 --> 09:38.770
- Shit!
- It's no biggie.

09:38.780 --> 09:40.120
Happens all the time in Freeridge.

09:40.204 --> 09:42.748
Which is why Monse needs to
accept the offer to move in.

09:43.165 --> 09:45.876
Bitch, you're gonna stay? Why
are you holding out on us?

09:45.960 --> 09:48.504
They just asked. I still don't
know if I'm gonna do it yet.

09:48.588 --> 09:50.548
- There's a lot to chew on.
- She's gonna stay.

09:51.257 --> 09:52.925
What else do you have to get back to?

09:55.303 --> 09:56.846
What about the shelters in Riverside?

09:56.929 --> 09:59.599
Not ideal. This is the best
place for you right now.

10:07.023 --> 10:08.858
Maybe it'd be better
if I took the couch.

10:09.817 --> 10:11.577
'Cause you've never slept
in this bed before?

10:13.279 --> 10:14.279
Uh...

10:15.114 --> 10:16.140
we broke up.

10:16.490 --> 10:17.490
I know.

10:17.950 --> 10:18.951
- You do?
- Yep.

10:21.245 --> 10:22.371
What else did she tell you?

10:24.081 --> 10:26.500
- You really want to know what I know?
- Nah.

10:29.462 --> 10:30.462
Yes.

10:30.880 --> 10:32.506
She said you gave her an ultimatum.

10:33.507 --> 10:36.469
- I wouldn't call it an ultimatum.
- What would you call it?

10:39.263 --> 10:40.290
An ultimatum.

10:43.934 --> 10:46.354
When you're young, everything
is black and white.

10:47.104 --> 10:48.272
I was no different.

10:49.398 --> 10:53.319
I made Monse's mom choose
between me and her family.

10:53.611 --> 10:54.612
And she picked them?

10:54.695 --> 10:55.695
Nope.

10:56.405 --> 10:57.406
She up and left.

10:58.741 --> 11:01.786
I never thought she'd leave
Monse, and then she did.

11:02.953 --> 11:03.953
Why'd she do it?

11:06.707 --> 11:09.627
I guess her desire to leave finally
outweighed her reasons to stay.

11:19.512 --> 11:21.389
Hey, Siri, how high am I?

11:22.300 --> 11:23.839
Okay, I don't want to be lame,

11:23.840 --> 11:25.434
but I also don't want to
get in trouble with Julia.

11:25.518 --> 11:27.603
- So you do want to stay.
- I don't know!

11:28.062 --> 11:30.314
But I do not want to get kicked
out before I figure it out,

11:30.398 --> 11:32.191
so we need to kill this party, and fast.

11:32.566 --> 11:34.326
What's an undeniable way
to ruin a good time?

11:36.779 --> 11:38.219
How'd you get this alcohol?

11:40.533 --> 11:41.617
I have a fake ID.

11:41.909 --> 11:43.703
Nice!

11:45.871 --> 11:46.956
How do you pass with this?

11:47.707 --> 11:49.625
Sometimes I like to let
Mona's stache grow.

11:50.584 --> 11:53.170
What? Mustaches are not a
crazy reach for our people.

11:53.254 --> 11:56.173
I feel you. Body hair
doesn't discriminate.

11:56.340 --> 11:58.467
If you need a good laser
lady, I have one.

12:04.598 --> 12:05.599
Jane...

12:06.517 --> 12:08.060
would you mind doing that outside?

12:08.686 --> 12:09.812
It's a vape.

12:12.020 --> 12:13.952
Ruby, you want to come keep me company?

12:13.953 --> 12:14.990
Yeah.

12:19.071 --> 12:21.240
Girl, what are you so vaclenched about?

12:21.370 --> 12:22.470
We're in Brentwood.

12:22.491 --> 12:24.535
No one here gets in trouble
for booze and drugs.

12:24.618 --> 12:26.370
Only Ponzi schemes and embezzlement.

12:26.454 --> 12:27.788
And laundering.

12:27.872 --> 12:30.499
My dad's partner is in
prison for money laundering.

12:31.959 --> 12:32.960
Interesting.

12:33.544 --> 12:35.004
Just out of curiosity...

12:36.046 --> 12:38.382
what do you think his missteps
were? I mean in general, like,

12:38.466 --> 12:40.634
if he could go back and have
a do-over to not get caught,

12:40.718 --> 12:42.386
what do you think he'd do differently?

12:43.110 --> 12:44.250
So...

12:44.597 --> 12:46.307
you look uncomfortably good.

12:46.766 --> 12:47.766
Thank you.

12:48.851 --> 12:51.604
You've been gone for a while. I'm
surprised you're not showing.

12:52.021 --> 12:53.314
I'm not pregnant, Jasmine.

12:53.397 --> 12:56.117
Good, 'cause no one should have to
inherit that tiny, weird forehead.

12:57.026 --> 13:00.404
So... how long do you think
you're gonna be staying here?

13:01.155 --> 13:02.740
Trying to figure that out now.

13:03.032 --> 13:04.032
Maybe full time.

13:04.825 --> 13:06.494
Ooh, what an amazing op!

13:06.994 --> 13:08.954
- I know.
- Not for you, girl. For me.

13:09.413 --> 13:11.457
With you gone, that leaves
a hole in the team,

13:11.740 --> 13:14.840
which I can fill, and that
will make the core four

13:14.850 --> 13:16.504
become the core more!

13:17.755 --> 13:20.382
Oh, but don't worry. I will wear
flannel on Wednesdays in your honor

13:20.466 --> 13:21.466
and I won't bone Cesar.

13:22.176 --> 13:23.803
Well, maybe I will. TBD.

13:24.261 --> 13:25.387
Emphasis on the D!

13:27.014 --> 13:29.558
- How is he?
- You really still crunk for that junk?

13:29.600 --> 13:30.630
No.

13:30.643 --> 13:31.670
No, we're done.

13:31.811 --> 13:33.062
I was just thinking that...

13:45.741 --> 13:48.285
Monse wants to know where
I am and what I'm doing.

13:48.494 --> 13:50.913
Definitely don't let her know
you're eating on her bed.

13:52.164 --> 13:54.875
Should we, uh... should
we move to the kitchen?

13:55.543 --> 13:56.627
Too much effort.

14:00.464 --> 14:02.216
So, does Monse like Brentwood?

14:02.508 --> 14:03.508
What's not to like?

14:05.052 --> 14:07.513
- What if she doesn't come back?
- Not an option.

14:08.097 --> 14:09.097
Right.

14:12.393 --> 14:13.477
Maybe it should be.

14:15.396 --> 14:16.647
I mean, look at us.

14:17.857 --> 14:19.984
We're hiding out, trying
to keep you safe.

14:20.568 --> 14:23.028
No kid should live like
this or even be around it.

14:26.365 --> 14:28.659
Think it would be selfish of
me to make her come home?

14:28.868 --> 14:29.869
I can't answer that.

14:32.121 --> 14:34.248
I love her more than
anything in the world.

14:36.125 --> 14:37.125
Me too.

14:37.960 --> 14:39.211
I don't want to lose her.

14:40.713 --> 14:41.713
Neither do I.

14:45.634 --> 14:48.012
So... what should I text her?

14:49.471 --> 14:50.848
Say you're happy and safe.

14:52.224 --> 14:53.809
Don't give her a reason to come home.

14:56.395 --> 14:58.188
You're confused.

14:58.270 --> 14:59.880
With laundering, you
just don't want to leave

14:59.900 --> 15:01.230
an electronic footprint.

15:03.110 --> 15:05.154
- You might wanna slow down.
- It's cool.

15:05.738 --> 15:07.323
I have a high metabolism.

15:07.406 --> 15:08.616
Those are edibles.

15:08.699 --> 15:11.327
I know. That's why I'm eating them.

15:11.410 --> 15:13.078
They're full of cannabis.

15:13.162 --> 15:14.622
What?

15:15.831 --> 15:17.583
- All of them?
- How many did you just eat?

15:19.418 --> 15:20.920
Ten? Twelve?

15:21.003 --> 15:23.005
Oh, my God!

15:23.255 --> 15:25.174
That amount with your body weight?

15:26.926 --> 15:28.510
You're fine. It's fine.

15:28.594 --> 15:30.804
- Then why are you making that face?
- What face?

15:31.513 --> 15:33.223
Monse!

15:33.724 --> 15:35.225
Does your mom have a panic room?

15:35.309 --> 15:37.436
- Why do you need a panic room?
- To panic in!

15:38.020 --> 15:40.314
I'm not safe, and if I'm not
safe, the money's not safe.

15:41.065 --> 15:43.150
I gotta see.

15:45.235 --> 15:46.987
He's high. Really high.

15:47.446 --> 15:50.491
I don't think he's ever
experimented before.

15:50.574 --> 15:53.160
- What do we do?
- First timers usually need a cuddle sesh.

15:53.243 --> 15:55.079
What's something we can
use to distract him?

15:55.162 --> 15:57.706
Like... a show or a
movie he really likes.

15:57.790 --> 16:00.501
He likes Coast to Coast, PBS News Hour,

16:00.584 --> 16:02.962
the Property Brothers...
the movie The Goonies.

16:03.045 --> 16:04.713
IMDBing that shit now.

16:07.270 --> 16:08.300
Ruby?

16:14.598 --> 16:15.599
Where were you shot?

16:18.769 --> 16:19.769
Here.

16:20.437 --> 16:21.563
You could touch it.

16:25.818 --> 16:27.820
I can't believe you almost died.

16:27.903 --> 16:30.531
I was so close to death, I tasted it.

16:31.699 --> 16:32.825
You want to see my scars?

16:33.534 --> 16:36.245
- Where?
- I have to take my shirt off.

16:37.913 --> 16:39.248
Did you get a breast enhancement?

16:39.331 --> 16:41.250
No. Reduction.

16:42.084 --> 16:43.210
Why would you do that?

16:43.850 --> 16:44.980
Want to see?

16:45.087 --> 16:46.213
Yeah.

16:46.296 --> 16:47.631
What am I doing?

16:47.715 --> 16:50.009
I'm not Brentwood, drugs are bullshit,

16:50.092 --> 16:52.553
and maybe, maybe I need just one.

16:56.432 --> 16:58.142
- How's Jamal?
- Bad.

16:58.225 --> 16:59.351
He's hallucinating.

16:59.435 --> 17:03.689
He says he has $200,000 in cash and
he killed someone named Julio.

17:04.272 --> 17:05.566
We might need to call a doctor.

17:05.648 --> 17:07.568
Fantastic. This is all I need.

17:08.250 --> 17:09.319
Damn it!

17:09.403 --> 17:10.529
Don't stress it.

17:11.030 --> 17:12.281
Totally fixable.

17:12.364 --> 17:14.032
You just have to get it to a cleaner's.

17:14.116 --> 17:16.076
The cleaners? How much
is that gonna cost?

17:16.160 --> 17:17.786
Only a couple hundred bucks.

17:17.869 --> 17:20.247
Give or take, depending on if
the rug is over 10k or not.

17:22.499 --> 17:25.586
$10,000? For a rug? That you walk on?

17:25.669 --> 17:28.797
I can't be here. I don't belong
in a house with a $10,000 rug.

17:28.881 --> 17:30.466
Calm down.

17:30.540 --> 17:31.939
I can't. I just ruined a rug

17:31.940 --> 17:33.510
that I can't replace, all
my friends are high,

17:33.594 --> 17:35.194
and I don't know if I should stay or go.

17:35.804 --> 17:38.891
Chill. Go get some air, and
I'll try to get out the stain.

17:42.936 --> 17:45.064
Oh, yeah. Yeah, these
feel like the original.

17:45.147 --> 17:48.317
Exactly. I mean, do you really
need any more than a handful?

17:48.859 --> 17:50.486
Kudos to your doctor!

17:53.697 --> 17:55.783
- Take that off.
- But I'm naked.

17:55.866 --> 17:58.452
Did you ever stop to think that my
mom probably wears it naked, too?

17:58.744 --> 18:00.370
Yeah, your junk is touching her junk.

18:00.829 --> 18:01.872
Ah, well, I'm already here.

18:02.206 --> 18:03.874
That's it. Everybody get in here!

18:03.957 --> 18:05.990
Yeah, everybody get in
here! Monse's pissed!

18:06.001 --> 18:07.079
- Ruby!
- Ruby!

18:07.080 --> 18:08.540
- Jamal!
- Jamal!

18:11.840 --> 18:13.550
Okay, y'all need to get it together.

18:13.759 --> 18:15.260
Stop getting high, making a mess,

18:15.344 --> 18:17.679
touching my mom's things
and each other's boobs!

18:17.763 --> 18:20.349
I'm trying to figure out what to do
with my life and all this stress

18:20.360 --> 18:21.370
isn't helping!

18:21.391 --> 18:23.685
- It sounds like you're feeling lost.
- You think?

18:24.394 --> 18:25.896
I know who might have answers.

18:26.730 --> 18:28.941
Is there a spirit here?

18:33.946 --> 18:35.114
Yes!

18:35.739 --> 18:39.785
Do you have any unfinished business
with somebody in this room?

18:41.954 --> 18:43.330
Yes!

18:46.917 --> 18:48.085
Am I gonna get lucky?

18:48.836 --> 18:49.836
Yes.

18:50.504 --> 18:53.215
- Hey.
- What?

18:53.298 --> 18:55.759
The most polished girls
are usually the dirtiest.

18:55.843 --> 18:56.927
So dental dam that shit.

18:58.887 --> 18:59.888
Spirits!

19:00.806 --> 19:02.182
Boo, we need some guidance.

19:02.558 --> 19:03.684
What is your name?

19:05.227 --> 19:06.603
J,

19:06.687 --> 19:07.938
U,

19:08.230 --> 19:09.690
L,

19:10.065 --> 19:11.150
I...

19:11.233 --> 19:13.235
Julia! Does that mean I should stay?

19:13.735 --> 19:16.155
O, O, Julio! Who's Julio?

19:16.170 --> 19:17.197
Oh! Oh!

19:17.281 --> 19:19.783
Time out! Time out! Time
out! Time out! Time out!

19:19.867 --> 19:21.994
I'm sorry, please forgive me,
dude, but leave me alone.

19:22.000 --> 19:23.882
Oh, great, Jamal. Now
we have a Mexican ghost

19:23.883 --> 19:25.100
floating around this house!

19:26.039 --> 19:27.249
New game.

19:27.708 --> 19:28.917
How about "Never Have I Ever"?

19:29.001 --> 19:30.627
Oh, hell yeah. We know this.

19:30.711 --> 19:32.351
Great. I'll start with a softball.

19:33.213 --> 19:35.424
Never have I ever...

19:36.508 --> 19:37.508
had sex.

19:42.472 --> 19:43.724
Boy, why you gasping?

19:43.807 --> 19:46.810
Nobody puts up with doo-doo outfits
unless he at least getting it in.

19:46.894 --> 19:48.228
Is this about this Cesar guy?

19:50.022 --> 19:52.357
- Do you love him?
- Does he love you?

19:52.441 --> 19:54.359
Did he say it to you?

19:54.370 --> 19:55.619
With his words or, like,

19:55.620 --> 19:57.120
with his actions?

19:57.571 --> 19:59.740
- Why are you talking like that?
- Why are you?

19:59.823 --> 20:01.533
- Like what?
- Okay, okay, okay!

20:02.034 --> 20:04.411
For real. Do you think I
was too hard on Cesar?

20:06.079 --> 20:08.790
I don't want to, like, take sides...

20:09.120 --> 20:10.199
But I can't figure out

20:10.200 --> 20:12.711
which Monse to look at!

20:13.086 --> 20:14.254
Yo, here's the real.

20:14.963 --> 20:16.673
I don't think you were
hard enough on Cesar.

20:16.757 --> 20:18.256
He needs to take care of himself,

20:18.257 --> 20:20.135
and he can't if he's worrying about you,

20:20.160 --> 20:21.560
and you need to take care of yourself

20:21.580 --> 20:23.260
and you can't if you're
worrying about him.

20:24.640 --> 20:27.226
Stop thinking about him and
start thinking about yourself.

20:27.434 --> 20:30.229
Luck and death only come one time.

20:31.855 --> 20:32.898
What does that mean?

20:32.981 --> 20:34.107
It means I'm staying.

20:34.191 --> 20:35.943
That's such a healthy choice.

20:36.026 --> 20:39.696
I mean, considering what your
mom told my mom about your dad.

20:41.323 --> 20:42.323
What do you mean?

20:51.208 --> 20:53.585
God, you scared me. What's going
on? Where are your friends?

20:53.750 --> 20:54.850
Home.

20:55.254 --> 20:56.296
You got them a Lyft.

20:56.880 --> 21:00.217
Why'd you tell your friends that my
dad abused you? Did you say that?

21:02.427 --> 21:04.471
Not to Brian, just a few moms.

21:04.554 --> 21:05.889
And that makes it okay?

21:06.598 --> 21:08.292
If I stay here and my
dad comes to visit,

21:08.293 --> 21:09.768
my friends will think he's dangerous.

21:09.851 --> 21:11.853
No, they won't. They don't
even know your dad.

21:11.937 --> 21:12.937
But I do.

21:13.605 --> 21:15.148
And he's an incredible person.

21:15.399 --> 21:18.151
He's the only person who's
taken care of me. Unlike you.

21:19.900 --> 21:20.950
That's fair.

21:20.988 --> 21:23.031
My dad's been so worried about
me getting to know you,

21:23.115 --> 21:24.366
and now I understand why.

21:25.800 --> 21:27.020
You're so disappointing.

21:27.040 --> 21:30.830
Monse, I... I have a new life
here. All these people know me.

21:30.914 --> 21:32.291
I didn't want them to think I was...

21:32.300 --> 21:34.270
A bad person because
you left your child?

21:35.377 --> 21:36.586
But that's what you did.

21:38.130 --> 21:39.423
You wouldn't understand.

21:39.756 --> 21:41.008
No.

21:41.717 --> 21:42.968
No, I think I do.

21:46.096 --> 21:47.764
You lied to put on a better face.

21:48.050 --> 21:49.280
To hide the truth.

21:49.308 --> 21:51.852
Just like you lied about the
real reason that you left.

21:51.935 --> 21:54.062
You never left because you
needed to clear your head.

21:56.857 --> 21:58.442
What are you implying?

22:00.819 --> 22:02.696
Would you have left
if I looked like you?

22:17.544 --> 22:19.421
I'm so sorry, baby.

22:21.089 --> 22:22.089
So, so sorry.

22:23.925 --> 22:24.925
No.

22:25.927 --> 22:26.928
I'm sorry, Dad.

22:31.141 --> 22:33.477
All these years, I thought I needed her.

22:35.312 --> 22:36.312
And I don't.

22:37.814 --> 22:39.983
She missed out. Not me.

22:42.027 --> 22:43.027
Yep.

22:43.820 --> 22:46.281
Come here. Come here.

23:03.965 --> 23:04.965
Hey.

23:07.052 --> 23:08.762
You were pretty vague in your text.

23:11.056 --> 23:12.849
Just wanted to give you some space.

23:13.600 --> 23:15.102
So you moved into my bedroom?

23:17.604 --> 23:19.272
Don't worry. I'm moving out.

23:29.408 --> 23:30.408
I'm sorry.

23:33.036 --> 23:34.050
Me too.
