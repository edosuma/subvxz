02:23.900 --> 02:25.900
Pass it to me!

02:41.200 --> 02:42.500
Hit it!

02:42.600 --> 02:44.200
Yes! Yes!

03:39.900 --> 03:43.000
Jack, I just wanted to say that
she's not doing too well right now.

03:43.200 --> 03:48.000
Her condition has gotten a lot worse.
I've given her something for the pain.

04:25.800 --> 04:28.100
Mark?

04:28.800 --> 04:31.200
Hi, sweetie.

04:31.400 --> 04:33.400
Hi, Mom.

04:33.600 --> 04:37.500
- Why didn't you wake me?
- I thought you should sleep.

04:40.500 --> 04:42.700
Rather see you.

04:44.600 --> 04:49.000
- Has Dad told you everything?
- Yeah.

04:49.900 --> 04:52.000
I know you'll be OK.

04:53.000 --> 04:55.100
Mom...

04:55.300 --> 04:57.600
I'll always be with you, Mark.

04:58.700 --> 05:01.000
Always.

05:03.400 --> 05:05.800
I love you.

05:06.700 --> 05:09.000
I love you too, Mom.

05:21.300 --> 05:24.600
You're not gonna die, Mom.

05:24.900 --> 05:26.800
I promise.

05:28.200 --> 05:31.000
You're not gonna die cos I won't let you.

05:39.500 --> 05:44.200
Earth to earth,
ashes to ashes, dust to dust.

05:44.500 --> 05:46.700
The Lord bless her and keep her.

05:47.000 --> 05:51.100
The Lord make his face to shine
upon her and be gracious to her.

05:51.400 --> 05:56.600
The Lord lift up his countenance upon her
and give her peace. Amen.

06:47.700 --> 06:49.700
I can't leave him.

06:51.800 --> 06:54.800
- He needs me.
- It's two weeks, Jack.

06:56.400 --> 06:58.900
I can't do it.

06:59.100 --> 07:02.100
It's not like you'll be
leaving him with strangers.

07:02.900 --> 07:05.500
- I'm your brother. We're family.
- Mm-hm.

07:05.700 --> 07:09.300
You said, if you could close this deal
in Tokyo, you and Mark would be set.

07:09.600 --> 07:13.700
- You'd never have to leave him again.
- I only want what's best for him.

07:13.900 --> 07:17.500
I know this is tough,
but this is your chance, Jack.

07:17.800 --> 07:21.300
You have to take it, for you and for Mark.

07:24.200 --> 07:28.000
Besides, it'll do him good
to be around other kids right now.

07:31.500 --> 07:33.900
I'll bring him to Maine myself.

07:35.300 --> 07:38.400
We need to spend some time together.

08:04.400 --> 08:06.500
Hey, you. Copilot.

08:06.700 --> 08:09.600
If you ever get tired
of bombing the universe...

08:09.800 --> 08:12.900
...you're missing
a lot of great stuff out here.

08:33.299 --> 08:38.299
Mark, I know you're hurting...
but please don't shut me out like this.

08:40.299 --> 08:42.900
- She's coming back.
- No, Mark.

08:43.100 --> 08:46.000
Maybe not as herself,
but she's gonna come back.

08:48.400 --> 08:50.400
Mark, I miss her, too.

08:52.200 --> 08:54.600
But she's gone.

08:55.100 --> 08:56.800
No.

08:57.000 --> 08:58.400
Mark.

08:58.800 --> 09:00.800
Mark!

10:43.100 --> 10:45.000
They're here!

10:47.600 --> 10:51.600
- You made it.
- Oh, man. Eleven states in three days.

10:51.900 --> 10:55.100
- Connie, say hello to your Uncle Jack.
- Hello, Uncle Jack.

10:55.300 --> 10:57.600
- She's beautiful, Wallace.
- Like her mom.

10:57.700 --> 11:00.000
- How's it goin', Mark?
- Pretty good.

11:00.200 --> 11:05.000
- Mom said I can show you the house.
- She always gets her way.

11:05.400 --> 11:07.500
Things are gonna be OK, Jack.

11:08.600 --> 11:10.900
Mom! Guess who's here!

11:12.700 --> 11:15.100
- Mark?
- Hi.

11:17.100 --> 11:20.200
Oh, my gosh. Look at you!

11:23.100 --> 11:25.500
I can't believe it's been ten years.

11:27.000 --> 11:29.300
Jack.

11:29.500 --> 11:33.000
Hi. I really appreciate
everything you're doing.

11:33.200 --> 11:35.100
Janice would have done the same.

11:37.400 --> 11:39.400
Henry. Come on down here.

11:46.900 --> 11:48.900
Hospitality, Henry.

11:50.600 --> 11:54.400
Here. I made two of 'em,
so we could be brothers.

11:54.600 --> 11:57.600
Oh, well,
as if one wasn't enough.

12:03.000 --> 12:06.300
OK. You know, I spoke with
Alice Davenport this morning.

12:06.500 --> 12:09.500
She's the therapist who works
with Wallace at the hospital.

12:09.800 --> 12:12.900
She said she'd be glad
to talk with Mark while you're gone.

12:13.100 --> 12:16.300
I think it's a good idea.
I can't seem to reach him.

12:19.700 --> 12:22.000
Does everyone have everything they need?

12:22.200 --> 12:24.700
Sure, Mom.

12:25.200 --> 12:27.000
This is really beautiful.

12:27.200 --> 12:29.600
- Do you want some salad, Jack?
- Please.

12:29.800 --> 12:32.400
You know they
tore down the lighthouse?

12:32.500 --> 12:37.000
Oh, no. That one on the point?
I loved that old place.

12:37.300 --> 12:39.200
Yeah, so did we.

12:40.800 --> 12:44.400
- Isn't that where you two first, uh...
- First what?

12:45.700 --> 12:51.200
It's, um... where your father
and I... had our first picnic.

12:54.100 --> 12:57.300
- No, that's not gonna do it.
- Hey, here we go.

12:57.600 --> 13:01.700
Now you have to get the insides out.
That's where this comes in.

13:02.000 --> 13:04.000
Like that.

13:07.800 --> 13:09.900
Henry, please!

13:10.100 --> 13:11.800
OK, wait, wait, wait.

13:12.000 --> 13:14.800
Jack. I think he's gonna be fine.

13:18.700 --> 13:20.500
Yeah.

13:36.100 --> 13:38.400
Mark, you understand, don't you?

13:40.500 --> 13:45.600
I'm leaving you now so I...
so I never have to leave you again.

13:47.500 --> 13:49.900
Two weeks, could be less.

13:51.700 --> 13:54.000
So cheer up!

13:54.300 --> 13:59.200
It's winter break. All you have to do is
play with Henry and you have a great time.

14:04.000 --> 14:06.300
I love you, Dad.

14:06.600 --> 14:08.500
I love you, too.

14:12.500 --> 14:14.900
We'll be together real soon.

14:16.800 --> 14:19.400
I promise.

14:19.500 --> 14:21.500
Give me a kiss.

14:23.300 --> 14:25.600
I love you.

14:25.800 --> 14:28.200
Bye, Dad.

15:22.100 --> 15:24.100
Grenade!

16:03.600 --> 16:05.600
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

16:05.800 --> 16:08.900
Not so fast. How about some breakfast?

16:11.900 --> 16:14.500
- Did you sleep OK last night?
- Yeah.

16:14.700 --> 16:17.500
Yeah? Henry didn't keep you
up all night talking?

16:17.800 --> 16:19.700
- No. It was fine.
- Good.

16:25.100 --> 16:27.800
We're really glad you're here, Mark.

16:29.300 --> 16:32.000
Hey, Mark! Come on! Let's go!

16:33.300 --> 16:36.400
- See you at lunch.
- Thanks.

16:48.800 --> 16:50.000
Mark!

16:50.100 --> 16:53.300
- Nice catch. Hit me.
- Hey!

17:18.800 --> 17:21.500
Afraid of heights?

17:21.700 --> 17:23.599
- No.
- Good.

17:25.500 --> 17:28.300
See you at the top.

17:35.100 --> 17:37.700
- You coming?
- Sure.

18:46.800 --> 18:48.700
Come on, it's easy.

18:55.700 --> 18:57.600
Help me up.

19:08.600 --> 19:12.100
If I let you go,
do you think you could fly?

19:13.700 --> 19:15.600
Help.

19:33.800 --> 19:35.700
Hey!

19:43.500 --> 19:45.500
Stop!

20:00.200 --> 20:02.200
Hey, Henry, grenade!

20:03.400 --> 20:06.000
Oh, yeah? Watch this.

20:08.300 --> 20:10.400
Wow! Great shot.

20:21.400 --> 20:23.800
Yeah!

20:39.500 --> 20:42.700
Hey! What the hell's goin' on here,
goddamn it?!

20:43.000 --> 20:47.300
- Time to go.
- Come back here, you little bastards!

21:19.600 --> 21:21.500
Hey, wait up, Henry!

21:36.200 --> 21:38.600
Hey, cool.

21:42.200 --> 21:45.100
What you got in the box?

22:01.000 --> 22:04.200
- Go on.
- They give you cancer.

22:05.000 --> 22:07.600
Who cares? You're gonna die anyway.

22:21.600 --> 22:23.900
Did you see your mom after she was dead?

22:24.100 --> 22:28.200
I wanted to. They wouldn't let me.

22:28.400 --> 22:31.800
You should have made them let you.
It's very important.

22:32.000 --> 22:36.300
See, people don't like to talk about death.
That's why you have to investigate.

22:36.700 --> 22:39.700
- It's scientific.
- It doesn't feel like that.

22:41.200 --> 22:44.000
What did your mom look like
the last time you saw her?

22:44.200 --> 22:47.400
- Kinda pale.
- Kinda pale.

22:47.700 --> 22:51.600
I took a real good look when my kid brother
Richard drowned in the bathtub.

22:51.900 --> 22:55.400
- Your brother drowned?
- He was completely blue.

22:55.700 --> 22:59.000
You should've looked at her eyes and lips...

22:59.200 --> 23:03.300
...and touched her skin to see
what it felt like-hot, cold.

23:03.600 --> 23:06.300
- Shut up about my mom.
- Hey, don't get mad.

23:06.500 --> 23:09.500
- I'm just trying to be scientific.
- Shut up or I'll hit you.

23:09.800 --> 23:12.300
Try it...

23:12.500 --> 23:14.500
...and I'll throw you down there.

23:16.800 --> 23:18.800
Oh, yeah?

23:20.500 --> 23:22.700
Hey, look. I'm sorry.

23:22.800 --> 23:27.200
That was really dumb of me.
I know how I'd feel if I didn't have a mom.

23:28.900 --> 23:31.100
Friends?

23:35.800 --> 23:37.700
OK.

23:55.700 --> 23:59.900
- I know, but that guy was scary.
- I know, and big. You were just...

24:00.100 --> 24:03.600
You were white.
And you were like, brrrrm!

24:03.900 --> 24:06.700
All right, guys, it's late.
Knock it off.

24:08.400 --> 24:10.900
I mean it. Not another peep.

24:11.100 --> 24:13.000
Peep! Peep!

24:21.100 --> 24:23.400
Hey, Henry.

24:23.600 --> 24:26.500
- What?
- Today was fun.

24:26.700 --> 24:29.000
Tomorrow will be even better.

24:37.600 --> 24:39.500
Whoa!

24:46.100 --> 24:48.800
- Hey, you ever read Skeleton Man?
- Who?

24:48.900 --> 24:52.400
He's this really cool superhero
you can't kill cos he's already dead.

24:52.700 --> 24:56.000
- Don't you ever read comic books?
- No, those things warp your mind.

24:56.200 --> 24:58.200
Hey!

25:07.600 --> 25:10.100
Nice knowin' ya!

25:22.900 --> 25:24.500
Come on!

25:32.500 --> 25:34.600
No!

25:53.700 --> 25:55.800
Henry, come on! Let's go.

25:58.900 --> 26:00.800
I love that dog.

26:24.300 --> 26:28.200
- Isn't that your mom?
- Yeah. She's always out there.

26:28.800 --> 26:32.600
- Why?
- She's goes up there to think about Richard.

26:32.900 --> 26:34.700
Kinda weird, huh?

26:34.900 --> 26:37.300
Come on. I wanna show you
my new invention.

27:01.500 --> 27:03.500
Come on.

27:09.400 --> 27:12.000
- Where are we going?
- To my shed.

27:25.100 --> 27:28.900
Awesome! What does it do?

27:29.800 --> 27:33.300
It took me three months
to make it. Beautiful, huh?

27:34.000 --> 27:38.300
You pull the cable back to here,
and you load over there.

27:38.600 --> 27:41.700
Grab a bolt. Go ahead. Lock and load.

27:46.300 --> 27:48.800
Now we...

27:49.000 --> 27:51.700
...line up the kitty cat.

27:51.900 --> 27:54.600
Don't hit her! Just give her a scare.

27:56.000 --> 27:57.900
Sure.

28:17.900 --> 28:20.300
What a great shot!

28:20.500 --> 28:23.400
Yeah. But the sight's not right yet.

28:47.600 --> 28:50.600
You know, this is a nice change.

28:50.800 --> 28:54.400
Most of my patients,
all they wanna do is talk.

28:54.800 --> 28:57.700
Well, I just don't have anything else to say.

28:57.900 --> 29:00.400
Your dad thinks you do.

29:00.600 --> 29:04.600
- He wants me to talk about my mom.
- Sometimes it helps.

29:05.300 --> 29:07.400
I can handle it.

29:07.600 --> 29:10.800
- You can?
- I have to.

29:11.400 --> 29:13.300
Why?

29:15.300 --> 29:18.100
Because when you make a promise...

29:19.100 --> 29:21.800
...when something's your fault...

29:22.000 --> 29:24.000
What did you do?

29:27.300 --> 29:29.300
I let someone die.

30:00.100 --> 30:02.100
Mom?

30:23.000 --> 30:25.000
Mom?

30:26.800 --> 30:28.800
Mark?

30:34.200 --> 30:36.900
Honey...

30:37.100 --> 30:39.000
...what's the matter?

30:43.500 --> 30:45.600
It is you.

30:45.700 --> 30:47.700
You came back.

30:48.800 --> 30:50.700
I knew you'd come back.

30:51.400 --> 30:54.200
Oh, sweetheart. I'm right here.

30:57.100 --> 30:59.100
OK, I'm right here.

31:01.800 --> 31:03.400
It's OK.

31:03.500 --> 31:05.500
Shh, it's OK.

31:09.700 --> 31:11.600
It's all right.

31:15.700 --> 31:19.000
I'm right here. I'm right here.

31:22.900 --> 31:24.900
I know you miss her.

31:28.800 --> 31:31.400
It's OK. It's gonna be OK.

31:34.100 --> 31:36.000
It's OK.

31:37.900 --> 31:39.900
It's OK.

31:49.400 --> 31:52.000
OK. All right, you got a piece. Now.

31:52.200 --> 31:54.600
- It's got blue on it.
- So it has to be the sky.

31:54.800 --> 31:57.000
Right. And it's got a straight edge.

31:57.300 --> 31:59.300
So it has to go here.

31:59.500 --> 32:01.700
Hey, you got it. All right!

32:01.900 --> 32:03.300
- Mark.
- Yeah?

32:03.400 --> 32:05.700
- Do you like living in our house?
- Sure.

32:06.000 --> 32:09.800
We're gonna look after you real good,
so you won't be sad.

32:12.600 --> 32:15.000
Mark, 0900 hours. Let's move out.

32:16.000 --> 32:19.100
- Not you.
- Why not? He's my friend, too.

32:19.400 --> 32:21.800
I'll play with you later.

32:24.800 --> 32:27.900
I don't care about your stupid secrets!
I got my own secrets.

32:28.100 --> 32:31.400
I'm not gonna tell you a single one!

32:52.100 --> 32:54.400
Status.

32:54.600 --> 32:56.600
System armed and ready.

33:00.800 --> 33:04.700
- Try to hit that sign.
- Negative.

33:05.700 --> 33:07.700
Try to hit that light.

33:07.800 --> 33:10.500
Negative.

33:11.300 --> 33:13.300
Targeting.

33:16.900 --> 33:18.800
What are you doing?

33:20.300 --> 33:22.300
What are you doing?!

33:30.500 --> 33:32.500
Oh, my God.

33:50.500 --> 33:53.100
I was only trying to scare him.

34:39.199 --> 34:42.000
Hey, Mark. Where's your sense of humour?

35:30.000 --> 35:31.800
Mark?

35:32.100 --> 35:35.600
- I'm sorry.
- It doesn't matter. They always fall down.

35:42.300 --> 35:45.000
Isn't she beautiful?

35:45.100 --> 35:47.400
Did you like her?

35:47.700 --> 35:50.700
Yeah. Everybody did.

35:50.900 --> 35:53.300
She was a wonderful person.

35:54.700 --> 35:57.500
And she loved you very much, Mark.

35:57.700 --> 36:02.800
The last time I saw her...
she said she'd always be with me.

36:04.800 --> 36:06.800
It's true.

36:07.000 --> 36:10.700
Your mother's alive in you.
She'll always be part of you.

36:11.700 --> 36:13.700
And you.

36:14.800 --> 36:17.200
Yeah.

36:18.400 --> 36:20.700
Is that Richard?

36:23.100 --> 36:24.800
Yeah.

36:26.100 --> 36:29.100
- I bet you miss him.
- Yeah, I sure do.

36:29.300 --> 36:31.400
- Hi.
- Hi, Henry.

36:31.600 --> 36:34.400
Mark, I have something
to show you in the shed.

36:35.600 --> 36:38.600
You want to? Go ahead.
I'll put these away, OK?

36:40.500 --> 36:43.500
So what are you guys up to out there?

36:43.700 --> 36:45.600
Sorry, Mom. Top secret.

36:55.500 --> 36:59.700
Look, I'm sorry about the dog.
It was an accident.

37:00.000 --> 37:04.200
You don't think I'd do a thing
like that on purpose now, do you?

37:04.500 --> 37:09.400
- So what d'you wanna show me?
- I want you to meet somebody very special.

37:16.200 --> 37:20.100
- Who is he?
- Mr Highway.

37:20.400 --> 37:23.100
Wow. What are you gonna do with him?

37:23.300 --> 37:25.300
It depends.

37:25.500 --> 37:27.800
- On what?
- On you.

37:29.000 --> 37:32.200
- Whether or not you'll help me.
- Help you?

37:32.400 --> 37:35.000
I promise you something amazing...

37:35.100 --> 37:37.500
...something you'll never forget.

37:38.700 --> 37:40.600
Are you in?

38:07.600 --> 38:09.700
Where are we goin'?

38:09.900 --> 38:11.900
We're here.

38:15.200 --> 38:17.200
Here. Help me rest him up here.

38:17.200 --> 38:19.200
OK.

38:22.700 --> 38:25.100
Come on, Mr Highway. Take a look.

38:30.200 --> 38:32.200
Poor Mr Highway.

38:32.500 --> 38:36.400
He's thinking about the end.
He's had enough of this terrible life.

38:36.600 --> 38:38.800
- What?
- Say goodbye.

38:39.000 --> 38:40.500
No!

39:41.500 --> 39:43.700
Come on. Let's go.

39:51.100 --> 39:53.100
I didn't know. I didn't know.

39:53.300 --> 39:56.900
- You didn't tell me. How could you do that?
- Shh. Just be quiet.

40:06.400 --> 40:08.500
Do you know what you did?

40:08.800 --> 40:11.600
Hey, come on. We did it together.

40:11.800 --> 40:14.700
You could have killed people.

40:15.000 --> 40:18.900
- With your help.
- Hey, I didn't know you were gonna do that.

40:19.100 --> 40:23.000
I feel sorry for you, Mark.
You just don't know how to have fun.

40:23.900 --> 40:27.000
- What?
- It's because you're scared all the time.

40:27.300 --> 40:30.400
I know. I used to be scared, too.

40:30.700 --> 40:34.600
- But that was before I found out.
- Found out what?

40:35.300 --> 40:39.100
That once you realise
you can do anything, you're free.

40:40.100 --> 40:42.500
You could fly.

40:42.700 --> 40:44.700
Nobody can touch you.

40:45.800 --> 40:47.900
Nobody.

40:48.100 --> 40:50.100
Mark...

40:51.100 --> 40:53.400
...don't be afraid to fly.

40:55.300 --> 40:56.900
You're sick.

40:57.100 --> 41:02.000
Hey, I promised you something amazing,
something you'll never forget.

41:02.300 --> 41:04.600
Where's the gratitude?

41:15.300 --> 41:18.300
- The largest one.
- The largest one? Ready?

41:18.600 --> 41:21.000
Can you catch this?

41:22.800 --> 41:24.700
Where'd it go?

41:24.900 --> 41:26.700
Hey, hey, hey.

41:27.000 --> 41:29.800
I'm here at Route 233 on
the outskirts of Rock Harbor...

41:30.000 --> 41:32.600
...where today there was a ten-car accident.

41:32.700 --> 41:36.200
Lieutenant Holman of the Rock Harbor
police said it was a miracle...

41:36.500 --> 41:41.500
...no one was seriously injured. Four people
were taken to the hospital for minor injuries.

41:41.800 --> 41:46.800
They have since been released. This is
Andrea Hall reporting. Back to you, Bob.

41:58.700 --> 42:03.600
Go ahead, tell him. Or better yet,
why don't we tell him together?

42:03.900 --> 42:06.300
"It was Mark, Dad. He talked me into it."

42:07.300 --> 42:11.700
"We were just playing a game. I had no idea
he was gonna do something like that."

42:11.900 --> 42:17.800
"Please, go easy on him. It's not his fault
he's all screwed up cos he misses his mom."

42:19.200 --> 42:21.900
What are we waiting for? Let's go.

42:22.200 --> 42:24.600
Dad, Mark has something to tell ya.

42:25.900 --> 42:30.400
- What is it? What's wrong with Mark?
- I don't know. He's been acting pretty weird.

42:30.700 --> 42:32.800
I better go see if he's OK.

42:43.100 --> 42:45.900
I told my dad I'd see if you were OK.

42:46.100 --> 42:48.900
Well, are you OK, Mark?

42:49.200 --> 42:51.100
Leave me alone.

42:52.100 --> 42:54.500
Leave you alone? This is my room.

42:56.400 --> 42:59.400
Guess what? Mom says
we can go skating tomorrow.

42:59.600 --> 43:02.700
Connie, what did I tell you
about coming into my room?

43:03.500 --> 43:06.200
But you guys weren't working or anything.

43:06.400 --> 43:09.500
You didn't answer my question,
so I'm gonna have to do it for you.

43:09.700 --> 43:13.400
You're not allowed to come into my room.
Not now, not ever. Never!

43:13.700 --> 43:18.200
You're wrong about that.
This is my room, too.
And I say she can stay.

43:21.200 --> 43:22.700
Mom, they're fighting!

43:23.000 --> 43:26.400
You like my sister, don't you?
Such a sweet little girl.

43:28.000 --> 43:32.700
It'd be too bad if something were
to happen to her, if she got hurt.

43:33.000 --> 43:35.200
You'd be sad, wouldn't you, Mark?

43:35.400 --> 43:37.700
But, hey, accidents will happen.

43:37.900 --> 43:40.100
Just ask my mom about Richard.

43:41.500 --> 43:43.400
Boys, boys! Henry!

43:43.600 --> 43:45.600
What's going on?

43:46.900 --> 43:50.100
I'm sorry, Mom. We were playing
this really dumb game.

43:50.400 --> 43:55.600
We weren't fighting.
We were just playing. Weren't we, Mark?

43:57.800 --> 43:59.800
Yeah. Playing.

44:03.700 --> 44:06.600
Well, all right,
but just not so rough, OK?

44:06.900 --> 44:10.400
You two looked like you were
trying to kill each other.

44:33.400 --> 44:36.400
Susan told me you were here.

44:36.700 --> 44:39.400
I guess you forgot our appointment.

44:39.600 --> 44:42.000
I just didn't feel like talking.

44:43.900 --> 44:47.800
Talking helps.
It helped the last time, didn't it?

44:48.500 --> 44:50.800
You're a doctor.

44:51.000 --> 44:52.900
You know things.

44:53.000 --> 44:55.700
Well, some things.

44:57.000 --> 45:00.000
What do you think? What makes people evil?

45:01.800 --> 45:07.000
Evil's a word people use when they've
given up trying to understand someone.

45:07.300 --> 45:11.400
There's a reason for everything
if we could just find it.

45:11.700 --> 45:14.000
What if there isn't a reason?

45:14.200 --> 45:16.300
What if something just is?

45:17.200 --> 45:20.400
Why, Mark? Do you think you're evil?

45:20.700 --> 45:22.700
Cos you let your mother die?

45:22.900 --> 45:24.900
You know that's not true.

45:28.400 --> 45:30.300
What if there was this boy...

45:30.500 --> 45:34.100
...and he did these terrible things
because he liked doing them?

45:34.300 --> 45:36.400
Wouldn't you say he was evil?

45:37.800 --> 45:40.000
I don't believe in evil.

45:42.800 --> 45:45.300
You should.

45:45.500 --> 45:48.300
Connie, come on! It's time for lunch.

45:51.300 --> 45:54.700
- Evans' residence. Henry speaking.
- Hey, it's Uncle Jack.

45:55.000 --> 45:57.600
- Oh. Hi, Uncle Jack.
- Is Mark around?

45:57.700 --> 46:02.100
Mark? No. Mark's not here right now.

46:03.200 --> 46:06.700
- Do you know where he is?
- No, I don't know where he is.

46:08.200 --> 46:11.100
- Are you boys having fun?
- We're having lots of fun.

46:11.500 --> 46:15.600
Mark really likes it here. You know
something? We really like him, too.

46:15.800 --> 46:18.700
Great. Well, would you tell him I called?

46:19.000 --> 46:21.700
- OK, Uncle Jack. Bye.
- Bye.

46:23.200 --> 46:25.900
So what are you guys up to this afternoon?

46:27.100 --> 46:29.300
I don't know. Not much.

46:29.400 --> 46:32.400
Well, I'm taking your mother
out to dinner tonight.

46:32.700 --> 46:37.200
Can you characters baby-sit yourselves
and not get into too much trouble?

46:37.500 --> 46:38.700
Sure, Dad.

46:38.900 --> 46:41.900
Dad, can I stay up and watch
Monster Theater tonight?

46:42.100 --> 46:44.900
No. It might warp
your impressionable brain.

46:45.100 --> 46:47.700
- You're not the boss.
- Yes, I am, vermin.

46:48.000 --> 46:50.400
Henry. That's enough.

46:50.700 --> 46:52.900
What's a vermin?

46:53.100 --> 46:57.500
Mom, Dad, guess what? Mark's been saying
he'd like to move into Richard's room.

46:57.800 --> 47:00.200
- That's not true.
- He seems to like it in there.

47:00.500 --> 47:03.500
- You know, that's not a bad idea.
- Wallace.

47:05.200 --> 47:07.500
We've been through this before. I just...

47:07.700 --> 47:10.100
- I don't wanna move in there.
- Mark, don't lie.

47:10.300 --> 47:14.400
Honey, give it some thought.
We can't keep it like that for ever.

47:14.600 --> 47:18.200
- It's turning into a museum.
- I know, but I didn't say for ever.

47:18.600 --> 47:20.800
That room'll change when I'm ready.

47:21.000 --> 47:24.000
If Mark wants to move,
there's a nice room on the third floor.

47:24.200 --> 47:28.200
- But Henry's making it up.
- Honey, if Mark moved in, it could help.

47:28.600 --> 47:31.400
It needs to be lived in.
I'm not saying throw out the toys.

47:31.600 --> 47:35.500
Let's... I... I just don't wanna
talk about it right now.

47:35.900 --> 47:38.800
I know you don't, but we've gotta face it.

47:40.000 --> 47:42.000
I do face it.

47:43.700 --> 47:45.600
I face it every day.

47:47.600 --> 47:51.100
- You're the one who's forgetting.
- Susan.

47:51.300 --> 47:53.900
- Oh, Wallace.
- Susan.

48:22.000 --> 48:23.900
Henry!

48:24.100 --> 48:26.000
Hi, Mom.

48:30.900 --> 48:32.800
Don't cry, Mom.

48:35.900 --> 48:37.900
Don't cry, Mom.

48:49.100 --> 48:51.900
- You look fantastic.
- Do you really have to go out?

48:52.000 --> 48:55.600
Yeah, Mark. We've been planning this
for weeks. You guys'll have fun.

48:55.900 --> 48:59.600
Listen, honey. Restaurant number's
by the phone if you need us, OK?

48:59.900 --> 49:01.800
All right, guys, good night!

49:01.900 --> 49:03.800
Night, Mom and Dad!

49:03.900 --> 49:05.900
We won't be late.

49:08.100 --> 49:12.400
Mark! Guess what we're gonna play?
Hide-and-seek, and I'm hiding first.

49:12.700 --> 49:15.300
No, Connie, wait! I've got a better idea.

49:16.200 --> 49:18.400
I bet I find her first.

49:29.700 --> 49:31.700
Connie, where are you?

49:34.200 --> 49:36.200
Connie!

49:39.700 --> 49:41.700
Connie!

49:47.500 --> 49:49.500
Aagh!

49:49.600 --> 49:51.400
Hey, no fair.

49:51.600 --> 49:53.700
"No fair"?

49:53.900 --> 49:56.300
What do you think this is? A game?

50:10.400 --> 50:12.400
Connie, where are you?

50:41.300 --> 50:43.300
Connie!

50:44.400 --> 50:45.800
Connie!

50:46.800 --> 50:48.800
What's going on?

50:49.000 --> 50:51.000
This is fun. Let's do it again.

50:51.100 --> 50:53.700
No, Connie. It's bedtime.

50:53.800 --> 50:56.600
You heard her. She wants to play again.

50:56.700 --> 51:00.500
Connie, what if I read you
a bedtime story instead?

51:01.500 --> 51:04.900
Connie doesn't wanna read stories.
Do you, Connie?

51:07.600 --> 51:09.600
I do too, vermin!

51:13.000 --> 51:15.000
(hums "Camptown Races')

51:36.300 --> 51:41.500
"And all the girls cried 'Boohoo!
We want to have our appendix out too."'

51:44.100 --> 51:47.200
"Good night, little girls.
Thank the Lord you are well."

51:47.400 --> 51:52.300
"'And now go to sleep' said Miss Clavell.
She turned out the light and closed the door."

51:52.600 --> 51:55.600
"And that's all there is.
There isn't any more."

52:12.300 --> 52:14.700
That was a darling story, Mark.

52:16.200 --> 52:19.800
- What are you doing?
- I wanna tuck in my kid sister.

52:28.500 --> 52:30.500
Such a sweet little thing.

52:32.100 --> 52:35.200
Do you really think I'd hurt her?

52:35.500 --> 52:37.600
Yes.

52:37.800 --> 52:40.000
What are you gonna do?

52:40.200 --> 52:42.200
Watch her all night?

53:00.400 --> 53:02.400
Wallace, I'm sorry, but...

53:02.600 --> 53:05.600
You've gotta stop
blaming yourself about Richard.

53:05.800 --> 53:09.100
I can't. I just can't.

53:11.500 --> 53:17.600
I left him alone. Less than six inches of water
in the tub and I left him to answer the phone.

53:17.900 --> 53:20.900
Susan, it wasn't your fault.

53:28.100 --> 53:30.100
You better get to the hospital.

53:34.200 --> 53:37.100
Do you want me to drop
Connie off at the Andersons'?

53:37.300 --> 53:39.200
No, she, uh...

53:39.400 --> 53:42.200
She went skating with Henry in Miller's pond.

54:29.200 --> 54:31.800
- Hey, where's your skates?
- Connie!

54:41.300 --> 54:43.300
Connie!

55:10.700 --> 55:12.700
Connie!

55:36.300 --> 55:38.200
- Connie!
- Don't go with him!

55:38.400 --> 55:40.300
Thin ice!

55:48.900 --> 55:50.900
Henry!

55:56.300 --> 55:59.900
Look out! Look out! Look out! No!

56:04.600 --> 56:06.600
Help me, Henry. Help me.

56:07.100 --> 56:09.200
Connie! Connie!

56:09.400 --> 56:12.100
Henry, help me. Help me.

56:16.200 --> 56:18.200
Help me out!

56:31.800 --> 56:33.800
Let us through. Let us through.

56:33.900 --> 56:35.900
Stay back. Stay back.

56:50.400 --> 56:53.100
Right. All right.

56:53.300 --> 56:55.300
All right, let's get her up.

57:18.400 --> 57:20.400
- Wallace!
- Susan, she's fine.

57:20.600 --> 57:23.200
She's fine. It's OK.

57:23.400 --> 57:27.400
They pulled her out in time.
She's gonna be OK. She's OK.

58:12.600 --> 58:15.000
I just thank God she's all right.

58:17.500 --> 58:20.100
There's something I have to tell you.

58:21.400 --> 58:25.000
- What?
- I'm not sure. I wasn't real close.

58:26.800 --> 58:30.800
At the pond... I don't think what
happened at the pond was an accident.

58:33.400 --> 58:35.400
What do you mean?

58:35.600 --> 58:39.400
The ice was too thin.
Henry was spinning her around.

58:39.700 --> 58:42.100
They were going way too fast.

58:43.400 --> 58:48.000
And he just let go.
He threw her toward the thin ice.

58:49.900 --> 58:52.600
- Mark.
- Henry said he hated her.

58:53.900 --> 58:57.100
- What are you trying to tell me?
- I've told you.

58:57.300 --> 58:59.200
I'm telling you.

58:59.400 --> 59:03.200
Connie didn't just slip.
You don't know what he is.

59:03.900 --> 59:06.600
Henry tried to kill Connie
and he could do it again...

59:06.800 --> 59:09.600
Stop it! Stop it, that's a lie.

59:11.700 --> 59:15.800
Henry's my son.
He's my little boy and I love him.

59:16.100 --> 59:19.100
Don't ever come to me with these lies again.

01:00:03.900 --> 01:00:06.200
- Henry.
- Mom.

01:00:06.400 --> 01:00:09.300
- I didn't see you.
- Shh. Don't wake her up.

01:00:10.600 --> 01:00:14.600
- I thought you were home with Daddy.
- I was worried about Connie.

01:00:16.900 --> 01:00:19.300
She's gonna be fine.

01:00:19.400 --> 01:00:22.400
- She wake up yet?
- Yeah, for a little while.

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:28.200
- She's still pretty confused, though.
- Yeah.

01:00:28.300 --> 01:00:31.800
I don't think she's gonna
remember much of what happened.

01:00:32.100 --> 01:00:36.600
That's good. It's probably better
for her to forget about the whole thing.

01:00:36.900 --> 01:00:40.300
Henry. What did happen on the ice?

01:00:40.400 --> 01:00:43.400
I told you, Mom. It was an accident.

01:00:43.700 --> 01:00:45.800
Yeah?

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:49.000
I know I've always treated her
like a bratty kid sister...

01:00:49.200 --> 01:00:53.500
...but until yesterday I never realised
how much she meant to me.

01:00:55.500 --> 01:00:57.900
I know.

01:00:58.900 --> 01:01:00.900
I'd better go home now.

01:01:04.800 --> 01:01:06.800
- Henry.
- Yeah, Mom?

01:01:12.100 --> 01:01:14.700
Never mind. I'll see you at home.

01:01:15.800 --> 01:01:18.900
- Tell Connie I was here.
- I will.

01:01:31.600 --> 01:01:34.500
- Hello, Dad.
- Mark, how are you, son?

01:01:34.800 --> 01:01:37.300
- You've gotta come back here.
- Why? What's wrong?

01:01:37.500 --> 01:01:41.200
It's Henry. He's been doing things.
Terrible things.

01:01:41.300 --> 01:01:44.600
- What do you mean, terrible things?
- He's got everyone fooled.

01:01:44.900 --> 01:01:47.400
Everyone thinks he's this great kid...

01:01:47.600 --> 01:01:49.800
...but he's really evil.
- Evil?

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:55.100
He killed this dog with this thing
that he made that fires steel bolts.

01:01:55.400 --> 01:01:58.900
Then yesterday... he tried to kill Connie.

01:01:59.200 --> 01:02:03.100
Whoa, wait...
Mark, is Wallace there? Or Susan?

01:02:03.300 --> 01:02:08.900
I tried to tell them,
but they won't believe me. Nobody will.

01:02:09.300 --> 01:02:11.200
What about Dr Davenport?

01:02:11.400 --> 01:02:14.000
She just thinks
I'm some screwed-up little kid.

01:02:14.100 --> 01:02:18.800
Mark, I want you to go to Dr Davenport
and you tell her what you told me.

01:02:19.100 --> 01:02:21.400
- All right.
- I'll be there soon.

01:02:21.600 --> 01:02:23.600
Please hurry.

01:02:41.600 --> 01:02:45.200
What's been going on?
What's troubling you?

01:02:45.400 --> 01:02:47.400
Mark! Good.

01:02:47.400 --> 01:02:49.400
Hi, Mark.

01:02:51.200 --> 01:02:55.100
- What are you doing here?
- He's just here because he wants to help.

01:02:55.400 --> 01:02:57.700
He says you two have been
having some problems.

01:02:57.900 --> 01:03:00.700
- He's the problem.
- Mark!

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:04.600
You're on his side, aren't you?

01:03:04.900 --> 01:03:08.000
- I'm on your side, too.
- No, you're not.

01:03:08.200 --> 01:03:10.600
He's got you fooled, just like everybody else.

01:03:10.800 --> 01:03:13.200
Mark! Wait.

01:03:15.200 --> 01:03:17.600
I didn't mean to cause you any trouble.

01:03:17.800 --> 01:03:22.700
It's not your fault, Henry.
Mark is going through some difficult things.

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:27.100
- Is he OK?
- What do you mean?

01:03:27.400 --> 01:03:29.700
Maybe I shouldn't say anything.

01:03:29.900 --> 01:03:33.000
But the way he acts when nobody's around...

01:03:33.100 --> 01:03:36.900
Dr Davenport, he scares me sometimes.

01:03:37.900 --> 01:03:39.900
Why?

01:03:44.100 --> 01:03:46.100
What does he do?

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:49.000
Please don't ask me that.

01:03:50.100 --> 01:03:53.100
- I can't tell you.
- Why not?

01:03:53.300 --> 01:03:55.300
Cos Mark's my friend.

01:03:56.400 --> 01:03:59.800
You won't be betraying him, I promise you.

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:02.800
Please, Henry. Tell me everything.

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:06.500
Everything?

01:04:12.900 --> 01:04:16.300
Sure missed an interesting session.
I like therapy.

01:04:16.500 --> 01:04:21.200
- What did you tell her?
- Sorry. That's strictly confidential.

01:04:21.500 --> 01:04:25.700
But you better stop telling lies about me,
cos no one's gonna believe you.

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:28.600
Sooner or later
they're gonna find out about you.

01:04:28.800 --> 01:04:32.500
Who's "they"? My dad? My mom?

01:04:33.800 --> 01:04:37.800
- I told your mom.
- Why would she believe you?

01:04:38.900 --> 01:04:42.900
- She's my mom, not yours.
- You know, you're wrong about that.

01:04:43.900 --> 01:04:47.900
- She is my mother.
- Your mom? You crazy?

01:04:48.200 --> 01:04:50.200
Your mom's maggot food.

01:04:50.400 --> 01:04:52.900
My mom said she'd always be with me.

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:55.700
She chose your mom
as a way of coming back...

01:04:55.900 --> 01:04:59.400
...but I guess you wouldn't
understand that. But it's true.

01:04:59.700 --> 01:05:02.200
She's my mother now.

01:05:03.900 --> 01:05:06.500
Hey, Mark.

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:10.000
Don't fuck with me.

01:06:13.900 --> 01:06:16.300
Looking for a midnight snack?

01:06:17.500 --> 01:06:21.800
Go ahead. Eat. Drink.

01:06:23.500 --> 01:06:26.300
- Don't let me stop you.
- What did you do?

01:06:27.500 --> 01:06:29.900
"Do"? Me?

01:06:30.100 --> 01:06:32.700
Oh, I get it.

01:06:32.900 --> 01:06:35.700
You think I put something
in my family's food.

01:06:35.900 --> 01:06:37.700
You think I...

01:06:37.900 --> 01:06:40.200
Mark, come on.

01:06:40.400 --> 01:06:43.400
Do you really think
I'd do a thing like that?

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:49.000
Mom, Dad, it's Mark! Better come quick.

01:07:07.100 --> 01:07:09.900
No, Mark, stop. Stop.

01:07:10.100 --> 01:07:13.400
It's all a mistake.
He's trying to poison you!

01:07:13.600 --> 01:07:16.300
- Oh, Mark.
- No!

01:07:17.700 --> 01:07:19.700
Calm down.

01:07:19.900 --> 01:07:22.100
Mark, please stop.

01:07:22.300 --> 01:07:25.800
Stop, stop, stop, stop.

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:29.700
- Just stop.
- No! No!

01:07:35.200 --> 01:07:37.800
- We'll talk in the morning.
- What for?

01:07:40.200 --> 01:07:42.600
- Nobody believes me.
- Mark.

01:07:45.500 --> 01:07:47.500
Good night.

01:07:58.900 --> 01:08:00.600
- He's OK.
- Oh, Wallace.

01:08:00.700 --> 01:08:04.000
He's OK. Now, look,
Jack'll be back in a few days.

01:08:04.200 --> 01:08:07.200
Let's just keep it together
until he gets here.

01:08:16.100 --> 01:08:18.700
Henry... go to bed.

01:09:39.899 --> 01:09:42.800
Mom? What are you doing?

01:09:45.100 --> 01:09:47.500
I was... I was just looking around.

01:09:48.600 --> 01:09:50.600
Uh-huh.

01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:59.900
Henry, if something were wrong...
you would tell me, wouldn't you?

01:10:00.300 --> 01:10:02.300
What do you mean?

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:07.100
I mean, sometimes when we're kids,
we do things that, um...

01:10:07.400 --> 01:10:09.700
What kind of things?

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:14.300
Things we feel bad about?

01:10:15.300 --> 01:10:17.700
I don't feel bad about anything.

01:10:25.700 --> 01:10:28.100
Look what I found.

01:10:32.200 --> 01:10:34.700
Where did you get that?

01:10:36.800 --> 01:10:39.200
You know where I got it.

01:10:40.800 --> 01:10:43.800
I couldn't find it after Richard's accident.

01:10:46.200 --> 01:10:49.200
Have you had it all this time?

01:10:49.500 --> 01:10:51.900
It was mine before it was his.

01:10:55.300 --> 01:10:57.900
But you knew I was looking for it.

01:11:00.400 --> 01:11:02.400
How did you get it?

01:11:03.800 --> 01:11:05.800
Henry?

01:11:07.500 --> 01:11:09.900
How did you get this?

01:11:11.200 --> 01:11:14.100
I took it. I'm sorry, Mom.

01:11:14.300 --> 01:11:19.300
I took it because I wanted something
to remember Richard by. That's all.

01:11:19.600 --> 01:11:22.400
So can I have it back, please?

01:11:24.600 --> 01:11:26.200
No.

01:11:26.400 --> 01:11:28.600
No, you can't have it back.

01:11:30.100 --> 01:11:32.800
- But it's mine.
- Henry!

01:11:34.200 --> 01:11:37.200
- Give it to me!
- Henry!

01:11:39.200 --> 01:11:41.200
Henry?

01:13:01.800 --> 01:13:05.600
- What are you doing?
- Missing someone.

01:13:05.800 --> 01:13:07.600
Who?

01:13:07.600 --> 01:13:11.400
Mark, did you cry at your mom's funeral?

01:13:12.600 --> 01:13:14.500
Why?

01:13:14.700 --> 01:13:18.900
I don't know. I figure you're expected
to cry at your mom's funeral.

01:13:20.100 --> 01:13:23.000
- But I don't know.
- You wouldn't.

01:13:23.300 --> 01:13:25.300
- Wouldn't what?
- Hurt her.

01:13:26.600 --> 01:13:29.500
Do you really think I'd hurt my own...

01:13:29.700 --> 01:13:31.700
- Oh, wait.
- What?

01:13:31.800 --> 01:13:34.900
I just remembered.
She's not my mom any more.

01:13:35.200 --> 01:13:37.500
She's yours. Isn't that what you said?

01:13:37.700 --> 01:13:40.900
- She's your mother now.
- Yeah.

01:13:42.200 --> 01:13:46.800
Your mom, my mom. What the hell?
We'll both miss her.

01:13:47.100 --> 01:13:49.900
I'll kill you first.

01:13:50.100 --> 01:13:52.000
Poor Mark.

01:13:52.200 --> 01:13:56.400
So violent, so disturbed.

01:13:56.600 --> 01:13:59.900
If you don't watch out,
they're gonna lock you up.

01:14:04.600 --> 01:14:06.500
I could kill you now.

01:14:06.700 --> 01:14:08.900
Go ahead. Jam it in.

01:14:09.100 --> 01:14:11.400
Gotta push pretty hard, though.

01:14:11.600 --> 01:14:14.300
The blood'll go right across the room.

01:14:14.500 --> 01:14:17.600
Come on. Come on.

01:14:18.500 --> 01:14:20.800
- Henry, have you seen...
- Dad, Dad, help me!

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:24.200
Mark! What the hell
do you think you're doing?

01:14:24.500 --> 01:14:27.400
- Answer me!
- Don't be mad at Mark. He's not himself.

01:14:27.600 --> 01:14:31.100
- You could have hurt him.
- He's the one who wants to hurt people.

01:14:31.400 --> 01:14:34.100
Mark, I'm sorry you don't wanna be friends.

01:14:34.300 --> 01:14:36.800
He's gonna do something.
He said he's gonna kill her.

01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:39.800
We're gonna call
Alice Davenport and have a talk.

01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:42.800
- You gotta believe me.
- You have got to calm down.

01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:45.700
- Mark. Mark!
- I gotta get outta here.

01:14:47.500 --> 01:14:50.900
- If that's the way you want it.
- You don't understand, Uncle Wallace!

01:14:51.200 --> 01:14:54.600
You will stay in here
until you are ready to talk.

01:14:56.300 --> 01:14:58.500
Uncle Wallace!

01:15:08.900 --> 01:15:11.200
Uncle Wallace! Uncle Wallace!

01:15:20.700 --> 01:15:24.200
Susan! Susan! Susan!

01:15:25.600 --> 01:15:27.400
Susan! Susan!

01:15:28.600 --> 01:15:31.200
No. No... Susan!

01:15:31.800 --> 01:15:33.900
Mom, I decided to clear up the shed.

01:15:34.100 --> 01:15:36.700
Henry, stop. Just stop.

01:15:37.600 --> 01:15:40.200
We have to talk.

01:15:40.400 --> 01:15:42.800
Can we go for a walk, Mom?

01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:45.600
You know, like we did when I was little.

01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:51.600
No. Susan!

01:15:53.500 --> 01:15:54.600
Susan!

01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:02.900
Susan! Susan!

01:16:06.700 --> 01:16:07.800
Susan!

01:16:12.600 --> 01:16:14.300
Susan!

01:16:22.200 --> 01:16:24.400
Mark! Watch the glass! Take it easy.

01:16:24.600 --> 01:16:26.200
Easy. Take it easy.

01:16:26.400 --> 01:16:28.400
Mark! Mark!

01:16:46.600 --> 01:16:49.000
- Henry?
- Yes, Mom?

01:16:50.400 --> 01:16:53.000
You have to tell me the truth now.

01:16:54.200 --> 01:16:58.500
- What happened the night Richard died?
- Don't you know?

01:16:58.700 --> 01:17:02.600
- I'd like to hear it from you.
- I was downstairs playing.

01:17:02.900 --> 01:17:06.300
Henry. Don't lie to me, all right?

01:17:06.500 --> 01:17:09.200
Just don't lie to me.

01:17:10.600 --> 01:17:12.800
Now you tell me...

01:17:15.900 --> 01:17:18.300
...did you kill Richard?

01:17:20.200 --> 01:17:22.500
What if I did?

01:17:25.400 --> 01:17:27.300
Well, um...

01:17:28.500 --> 01:17:30.900
- What, Mom?
- We'll get you help.

01:17:31.900 --> 01:17:35.100
You don't look too good, Mom.
Looks like you need the help.

01:17:35.300 --> 01:17:38.600
- You have to trust me, Henry.
- No.

01:17:38.800 --> 01:17:40.800
No, I can't.

01:17:42.300 --> 01:17:45.100
You just wanna send me away, don't you?

01:17:45.200 --> 01:17:46.800
Why, no. No, I don't.

01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:50.100
- You wanna put me in one of those places.
- No, Henry.

01:17:50.200 --> 01:17:54.600
Well, I'd much rather die, you hear me?
I'd much rather be dead.

01:17:54.900 --> 01:17:57.300
Henry! Henry, no.

01:17:59.400 --> 01:18:01.400
Henry!

01:18:07.300 --> 01:18:09.900
Henry! Henry!

01:18:15.300 --> 01:18:17.300
Henry! Henry!

01:18:20.800 --> 01:18:23.100
Looking for me, Mom?

01:18:23.300 --> 01:18:27.100
- Oh, Henry.
- You really thought I was gonna jump, huh?

01:18:27.300 --> 01:18:29.700
I guess you don't know me very well, Mom.

01:18:30.700 --> 01:18:32.300
Henry!

01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:44.700
Henry!

01:18:44.800 --> 01:18:47.000
Yes, Mom?

01:18:47.200 --> 01:18:49.100
Henry, please! No!

01:19:14.500 --> 01:19:16.900
I'm gonna kill you.

01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:32.000
- No! No!
- I'm gonna kill you!

01:20:00.300 --> 01:20:02.300
Hold on, Henry. Hang on to me.

01:20:03.700 --> 01:20:06.500
Come on! Don't let go.

01:20:06.700 --> 01:20:08.700
Hold on, Mark.

01:20:10.200 --> 01:20:12.200
Hang on to me! Come on!

01:20:13.400 --> 01:20:15.600
Come on. Get up. Pull up.

01:20:16.400 --> 01:20:17.900
Come on!

01:20:18.100 --> 01:20:20.100
Mark! Hang on!

01:20:21.500 --> 01:20:22.800
- Mom.
- Henry.

01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:25.000
Mom, I love you.

01:20:25.200 --> 01:20:28.000
Mom, I need your other hand.

01:20:28.100 --> 01:20:29.200
Come on.

01:20:29.300 --> 01:20:33.500
- Help me.
- Mark! Hang on.

01:20:35.400 --> 01:20:39.100
- Help me.
- Hang on, Henry, come on!

01:20:39.900 --> 01:20:41.900
Mom, pull me up.

01:20:47.400 --> 01:20:50.400
- Help.
- No, Mark. No!

01:20:50.600 --> 01:20:52.400
Mom! Mom, I love you.

01:20:52.600 --> 01:20:54.100
Help me!

01:20:57.100 --> 01:20:58.700
- Hang on.
- Help me.

01:20:58.800 --> 01:21:01.800
Mom, help! Help me, please.

01:21:02.100 --> 01:21:03.600
Henry.

01:21:03.700 --> 01:21:06.900
- Mom.
- Henry.

01:22:02.800 --> 01:22:06.200
Henry is gone,
and the rest of us are safe.

01:22:06.400 --> 01:22:08.900
But sometimes, late at night...

01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:13.400
...I find myself thinking,
not about Henry, but about Susan...

01:22:13.600 --> 01:22:17.000
...and wondering,
if she had it to do over...

01:22:17.200 --> 01:22:19.700
...would she make the same choice?

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:22.100
I guess I'll always wonder.

01:22:22.200 --> 01:22:24.200
But I know I'll never ask.

01:26:39.900 --> 01:26:42.900
