01:16.100 --> 01:17.200
So he said to me,

01:17.234 --> 01:19.066
"I just can't move my feet
like you do, Bud."

01:19.100 --> 01:22.033
So I says, "Hammer,
please don't make me hurt you.

01:22.067 --> 01:24.533
Now, just watch my feet."

01:24.567 --> 01:25.934
And the rest,
shall we say, is...

01:25.968 --> 01:27.967
A lie?

01:28.601 --> 01:29.567
Yes.

01:29.601 --> 01:31.166
Yes, my mouth
must be punished.

01:31.200 --> 01:33.401
Kiss me, you minx.

01:40.534 --> 01:42.966
Was it everything
I told you it would be?

01:43.000 --> 01:45.001
No.

01:45.400 --> 01:46.900
But it was everything

01:46.934 --> 01:49.434
the other girls
told me it would be.

01:51.767 --> 01:54.633
Well, then, let's try
my patented gyro-tongue action.

01:54.667 --> 01:56.467
Look...

01:56.501 --> 01:59.099
before I cheapen
myself anymore,

01:59.133 --> 02:01.667
are you sure you can get
front-row tickets

02:01.701 --> 02:04.266
to the Vanilla Ice
concert?

02:04.300 --> 02:05.633
Hey.

02:05.667 --> 02:08.767
Now, I'm the one
who showed Ice, Hammer's steps.

02:14.501 --> 02:18.234
Now, play that funky
lip music, white girl.

02:28.267 --> 02:30.400
Hey, if I told
you punks once,

02:30.434 --> 02:32.166
I told you
a thousand times.

02:32.200 --> 02:34.734
Keep your hands
off my daughter.

02:35.901 --> 02:38.134
You little ninny.

02:47.167 --> 02:50.234
Oh, I love it when
they come back for more.

02:53.300 --> 02:55.468
Oh, hi, son.

02:56.501 --> 02:57.500
Turn on the lights.

02:57.534 --> 02:58.966
What for?

02:59.000 --> 03:01.034
Turn on the lights!

03:03.801 --> 03:06.633
Does that look like
Kelly to you?

03:08.367 --> 03:10.067
Does it?!

03:16.767 --> 03:17.900
You mean...

03:17.934 --> 03:21.334
that was you over there,
Bundyfying that girl?

03:24.667 --> 03:26.900
All right, son.

03:28.000 --> 03:30.300
Come on over here,
now.

03:30.334 --> 03:31.433
Sit back down--
Here.

03:31.467 --> 03:33.133
Put your little arm
around her-- There.

03:33.167 --> 03:34.266
Hey, Peg!

03:34.300 --> 03:36.567
Peg, get down here,
you gotta see this!

03:36.601 --> 03:37.733
Bring
the camera!

03:37.767 --> 03:39.667
I gotta go.

03:39.701 --> 03:41.767
Call me when you get
the tickets.

03:41.801 --> 03:45.600
And remember,
the closer I get to Ice...

03:45.634 --> 03:49.101
the closer you get
to the heat.

03:54.868 --> 03:56.934
Oh! What is it, Al?
What is it?

03:56.968 --> 03:59.467
Are Marcie and Jefferson
playing nude Jeopardy again?

03:59.501 --> 04:00.467
No, no.

04:00.501 --> 04:02.266
No. More incredible.

04:02.300 --> 04:04.101
Bud had a girl here.

04:04.267 --> 04:06.134
Yeah, right.

04:07.200 --> 04:08.533
Al, I thought
we agreed

04:08.567 --> 04:11.401
not to make fun of him
to his face.

04:11.934 --> 04:13.400
Now, good night,
honey.

04:13.434 --> 04:14.600
And don't worry.

04:14.634 --> 04:17.500
One day, it won't be
just a cruel joke.

04:18.701 --> 04:21.099
Does no one in this house
see my sex appeal?

04:21.132 --> 04:24.400
I mean, I see it.
These people must be crazy.

04:24.434 --> 04:26.900
Well, luckily, I have a girl
who loves me now.

04:26.934 --> 04:27.999
Buy the way, Dad,

04:28.033 --> 04:29.834
I need 60 bucks
to take her to a concert,

04:29.868 --> 04:33.734
or she's gonna go with someone
she finds genuinely attractive.

04:39.701 --> 04:42.900
Daddy? Have I told you
how much I loved you?

04:42.934 --> 04:44.200
Oh, no.

04:44.234 --> 04:46.200
How much, Kelly?

04:46.234 --> 04:48.066
A whole lot.

04:48.100 --> 04:50.300
No, I mean, how much
money do you want?

04:50.334 --> 04:51.700
That's what I was
talking about:

04:51.734 --> 04:52.800
a whole lot.

04:52.834 --> 04:55.033
Daddy, I need
this money so bad.

04:55.067 --> 04:58.166
Our modeling school's going on
this really important field trip

04:58.200 --> 05:00.633
to the old models
home...

05:00.667 --> 05:03.600
to visit...Renee.

05:03.634 --> 05:06.733
She was the first model
who only had one name.

05:06.767 --> 05:10.266
I mean, since Renee, models
from Iman to Cheryl Tiegs

05:10.300 --> 05:13.301
have had only one name.

05:19.334 --> 05:20.500
Forget it, Kel.

05:20.534 --> 05:22.333
Dad works hard
for his money,

05:22.367 --> 05:24.266
and I say we use it
only for necessities.

05:24.300 --> 05:26.266
He's gonna give it to me
so I can get me some,

05:26.300 --> 05:27.834
aren't you, Dad?

05:31.834 --> 05:34.233
Yep, both my kids
have legitimate requests,

05:34.267 --> 05:36.099
so, uh, maybe I shall
solve this

05:36.133 --> 05:38.900
as the oh-so-wise Solomon
would.

05:38.934 --> 05:40.567
I shall keep my money

05:40.601 --> 05:43.434
and go to the nudie bar
tomorrow.

05:45.601 --> 05:48.934
So it shall be written,
so it shall be danced.

05:48.968 --> 05:51.934
Part the seas
of uselessness.

05:53.567 --> 05:57.267
I must go sleep
with the red plague.

06:11.200 --> 06:14.401
Well, maybe for a penny.

06:15.601 --> 06:17.099
Get out of here,
you old rag.

06:17.133 --> 06:19.101
Oh.

06:26.601 --> 06:29.266
What's wrong
with everyone, huh?

06:29.300 --> 06:31.500
I mean, surely a quarter's
not too much to ask

06:31.534 --> 06:33.900
to rub your hands
over all this.

06:34.968 --> 06:37.934
<i>Yeah, it's a real bargain.</i>

06:37.968 --> 06:40.567
You and I are
a lot alike, boy.

06:40.601 --> 06:41.900
<i>No.</i>

06:41.934 --> 06:44.301
<i>I've had sex.</i>

06:48.000 --> 06:52.034
<i>And at least I have the decency
to die at 13.</i>

06:56.501 --> 06:57.800
I wonder how
Kelly's doing

06:57.834 --> 06:59.900
on her new roller-skating
waitress job.

06:59.934 --> 07:02.667
Help me!

07:04.801 --> 07:07.700
Open the door! Open the door!
Open the door!

07:12.734 --> 07:16.066
Open the door, Bud!
Hurry!

07:16.100 --> 07:18.034
Hurry!

07:25.467 --> 07:26.533
Thank you.

07:26.567 --> 07:29.167
But a trifle late.

07:29.868 --> 07:32.600
Help me down
the steps, Sneezy.

07:33.801 --> 07:36.066
Dumb, stupid,
rotten job.

07:36.100 --> 07:40.267
Roller-skating waitress
at Bill's Hilltop Drive-In.

07:44.567 --> 07:46.266
This is what I spent
all those years

07:46.300 --> 07:49.101
learning my ABD's for?

07:50.400 --> 07:51.966
How much money
did you make, Kel?

07:52.000 --> 07:53.166
Nothing.

07:53.200 --> 07:54.966
This is
my first order.

07:55.000 --> 07:57.700
Stupid people put
their stupid restaurant

07:57.734 --> 07:59.999
on a stupid hill.

08:00.033 --> 08:02.366
So these people order
burgers and fries,

08:02.400 --> 08:04.300
and then they load me
into this chute,

08:04.334 --> 08:05.867
fire me towards the car.

08:05.901 --> 08:07.467
And I'm doing fine.

08:07.501 --> 08:11.033
I'm also doing warp 10
zooming down the expressway

08:11.067 --> 08:13.667
"It's a bird. It's a plane.

08:13.701 --> 08:17.967
No, it's a girl going 90
with a dress over her head."

08:18.834 --> 08:20.667
You know,
if mom hadn't made me stop

08:20.701 --> 08:22.166
kissing for money
when I was 5,

08:22.200 --> 08:24.900
I wouldn't be
in this pickle of a fish.

08:26.501 --> 08:28.567
So...how'd you do?

08:28.601 --> 08:30.834
Well, you know, I haven't
actually started yet.

08:30.868 --> 08:32.600
Let me save you
a lot of grief.

08:32.634 --> 08:34.833
Don't try the oil-me-up-
for-a-quarter bit,

08:34.868 --> 08:36.600
because you can feel
the Chihuahua

08:36.634 --> 08:38.467
down the block for free.

08:46.100 --> 08:48.433
Bud, I just can't miss
this bus trip.

08:48.467 --> 08:51.633
I mean, if I do, I'll fall
behind the other models.

08:51.667 --> 08:54.667
I'm already failing
Smiling 101.

08:55.400 --> 08:56.966
Oh, my God.
Now I've done it.

08:57.000 --> 09:00.167
My brain's beating faster.
Help me.

09:00.734 --> 09:04.266
Easy now,
Breakfast of Champions.

09:04.300 --> 09:06.667
Now, listen...
from here on in,

09:06.701 --> 09:08.800
I'll do the thinking
for the both of us,

09:08.834 --> 09:10.600
and you do the working
for the both of us.

09:10.634 --> 09:13.600
And we'll split it
30-70.

09:14.434 --> 09:16.999
Wait a second,
wait a second.

09:17.033 --> 09:19.099
I'm doing
all the work, right?

09:19.133 --> 09:22.067
So it's 30 for me.

09:23.234 --> 09:25.001
Okay.

09:28.033 --> 09:31.400
Oh, God, I just love
going to the mall.

09:31.434 --> 09:34.468
And did you see how
I controlled myself?

09:36.133 --> 09:39.034
I couldn't be more proud
of you if you were dead.

09:40.334 --> 09:41.600
You know, Peg,

09:41.634 --> 09:43.900
the least you could have done
was stand next to me in line

09:43.934 --> 09:45.867
when they shredded
my credit cards.

09:45.901 --> 09:48.834
Well, it wasn't my stuff
that put us over the limit.

09:48.868 --> 09:51.500
<i>It was that thing
you just had to have.</i>

09:51.534 --> 09:55.834
your Hanes underwear sewing kit.

09:56.634 --> 09:58.633
So, what do you want
to do tonight?

09:58.667 --> 10:00.300
Same thing the Rockefellers do:

10:00.334 --> 10:03.267
sew my underwear up
and cry.

10:03.534 --> 10:04.900
Come on, honey.

10:04.934 --> 10:06.633
I wanna go out.

10:06.667 --> 10:09.233
Peg, I just spent three hours
in your presence.

10:09.267 --> 10:10.733
I watched you buy lingerie

10:10.767 --> 10:13.734
that I wouldn't sleep next to
even if you weren't in them.

10:15.300 --> 10:19.434
So I don't want another
chalkboard screech out of you.

10:20.934 --> 10:23.301
Al!

10:24.701 --> 10:27.368
Honey, I wanna
go out tonight.

10:30.801 --> 10:31.767
Hi.

10:31.801 --> 10:32.834
Hi.

10:32.868 --> 10:34.233
You know,
in this day and age,

10:34.267 --> 10:36.133
I don't know why
you leave your door open.

10:36.167 --> 10:38.900
A maniac could just walk in
and kill you.

10:38.934 --> 10:42.667
Yeah, like I ever
get what I want.

10:45.434 --> 10:48.467
Yeah, Al, uh, we'd kind of like
to rent a video tonight,

10:48.501 --> 10:50.133
pop it on the old VCR,

10:50.167 --> 10:52.500
and spend a nice night at home.

10:52.534 --> 10:54.099
What are you telling me for?

10:54.133 --> 10:56.733
That's our VCR.

10:56.767 --> 10:58.266
Yes, I guess
about a month ago,

10:58.300 --> 10:59.900
when you came over
to borrow a soda,

10:59.934 --> 11:01.733
and we said,
"Take whatever you want,"

11:01.767 --> 11:04.567
you might have
misunderstood.

11:04.601 --> 11:06.999
Which brings me
to our flatware.

11:07.033 --> 11:09.800
Hey, I didn't steal
your bra.

11:11.167 --> 11:14.034
Easy, Marcie.

11:16.467 --> 11:18.233
Al, I know what
let's do.

11:18.267 --> 11:20.200
Let's go over to their house
and watch videos.

11:20.234 --> 11:22.166
Marcie, that's
a great idea.

11:22.200 --> 11:23.800
You'll bring the food
and the movies,

11:23.834 --> 11:25.834
and we'll bring
your VCR.

11:26.801 --> 11:28.366
Absolutely not.

11:28.400 --> 11:31.099
Dad, I just got Kelly
a babysitting gig,

11:31.133 --> 11:34.167
so tonight you have to stay
up in the bedroom with Mom.

11:34.868 --> 11:37.368
Oh, Al...

11:38.067 --> 11:41.733
We can break in
my new lingerie.

11:41.767 --> 11:42.999
I know.

11:43.033 --> 11:46.301
I'll wear
the mood panties.

11:54.968 --> 11:56.133
Hey!

11:56.167 --> 11:57.567
Let's do it!
Let's go!

11:57.601 --> 11:59.900
Last one to your house
gets to sit next to the wife.

11:59.934 --> 12:02.001
Come on.

12:04.767 --> 12:05.900
Babysitting.

12:05.934 --> 12:07.400
God, the degradation.

12:07.434 --> 12:10.633
You know, the last time
I babysat,

12:10.667 --> 12:13.400
it was for
this stupid little boy.

12:13.434 --> 12:15.099
I got so sick
of his whining

12:15.133 --> 12:18.200
that I held him over the toilet
and I kept on flushing it...

12:18.234 --> 12:21.300
telling him that the next time,
he'd be in it.

12:21.334 --> 12:24.166
From then on, every time
he heard running water,

12:24.200 --> 12:26.333
he freaked.

12:26.367 --> 12:29.401
Too bad, I just can't remember
who that kid was though.

12:37.267 --> 12:38.366
Oh, well.

12:38.400 --> 12:40.767
I'm sure he's
gotten over it by now.

12:42.300 --> 12:44.368
That must be
the client now.

12:44.934 --> 12:46.700
Just can't figure it out,
though.

12:46.734 --> 12:50.133
Why would people pay
$120 just to babysit one kid?

12:50.167 --> 12:51.767
I didn't say one kid, Kel.

12:51.801 --> 12:53.266
I said one family.

12:53.300 --> 12:55.733
Which family?

12:55.767 --> 12:58.600
The Hubbards.

13:02.567 --> 13:05.366
Kel, I got the money,
and I'm off to the concert.

13:05.400 --> 13:06.900
Bud, don't leave me!

13:06.934 --> 13:08.400
I'm your sister!

13:08.434 --> 13:09.500
What means more to you:

13:09.534 --> 13:12.001
your sister
or some little tramp?

13:15.968 --> 13:19.099
So...are we gonna be
good little boys and girls?

13:19.133 --> 13:20.767
Destroy!
Kill!

13:20.801 --> 13:21.767
Hate.

13:21.801 --> 13:24.467
I went wee-wee.

13:24.501 --> 13:27.567
Help!

13:28.067 --> 13:30.433
Okay, now,
here are our choices:

13:30.467 --> 13:32.733
<i>Anna Karenina,</i>

13:32.767 --> 13:34.567
<i>Beaches,</i>

13:34.601 --> 13:37.200
<i>Madame Sousatzka,</i>

13:37.234 --> 13:39.900
or the one that was
already in the VCR,

13:39.934 --> 13:43.067
<i>Breast Monsters
From Jupiter.</i>

13:43.834 --> 13:45.733
<i>Well, I've already seen
Breast Monsters,</i>

13:45.767 --> 13:46.934
but I'll go around again.

13:46.968 --> 13:48.700
I won't spoil
the ending for you,

13:48.734 --> 13:51.234
but it involves breasts.

13:52.467 --> 13:55.600
Oh, well, I'm game if
the ladies don't mind.

13:58.200 --> 14:00.700
Or we could watch
that one second.

14:00.734 --> 14:02.266
<i>No, let's watch
that Beaches one.</i>

14:02.300 --> 14:04.333
I wouldn't mind seeing
a couple of college babes

14:04.367 --> 14:06.001
in string bikinis.

14:06.434 --> 14:07.999
Actually...

14:08.033 --> 14:11.033
a complex tale about
the enduring friendship

14:11.067 --> 14:14.567
of two women
over a period of 18 years.

14:14.601 --> 14:17.633
Two girls swapping tans
on a beach for 18 years?

14:17.667 --> 14:19.366
Pop it in.

14:19.400 --> 14:21.900
You know, we can watch it
until they hit 30.

14:24.834 --> 14:27.800
<i>Then we watch
Breast Monsters From Jupiter.</i>

14:29.267 --> 14:30.834
Oh, relax, Al.

14:30.868 --> 14:33.099
You haven't even learned
how to capture breasts

14:33.133 --> 14:35.567
on this planet yet.

14:37.267 --> 14:38.600
He loves them,
you know...

14:38.634 --> 14:41.134
but he doesn't know
how to handle them.

14:41.901 --> 14:44.300
You know,
sometimes at night,

14:44.334 --> 14:45.733
he'll grab my knee,

14:45.767 --> 14:47.066
squeeze it, heh,

14:47.100 --> 14:49.800
and say, "Go on, say it.

14:49.834 --> 14:53.301
Who's the king, baby?
Who's the king?"

14:55.601 --> 14:59.600
Sometimes I laugh so hard,
I lose my place in my book.

15:01.901 --> 15:04.066
Well, i--
In my defense,

15:04.100 --> 15:05.900
uh, these days,
most things on her

15:05.934 --> 15:08.067
orbit around
her knees.

15:08.901 --> 15:11.334
Shall we movie?

15:17.501 --> 15:19.034
Honk, honk.
Oh!

15:19.534 --> 15:21.400
You love it, baby.

15:21.434 --> 15:23.600
"'Honk, honk,'
said the goss..."

15:23.634 --> 15:25.800
"Goose."

15:30.300 --> 15:31.567
Oh.

15:31.601 --> 15:35.700
"Goose, as she swims
to find..."

15:37.133 --> 15:39.600
"A."

15:40.868 --> 15:43.333
"...a worm for dinner"?

15:43.367 --> 15:44.867
Very good.

15:49.234 --> 15:52.300
"Quickie she flopped
her winds..."

15:52.334 --> 15:53.433
Oh, God.

15:53.467 --> 15:57.567
Look...let me capsize
the story for you.

16:00.534 --> 16:02.834
When the goose got
where it was going,

16:02.868 --> 16:06.900
she met this really cool
blonde goose...

16:06.934 --> 16:08.966
who only had one name:

16:09.000 --> 16:10.767
Kelly.

16:10.801 --> 16:12.800
Cool, huh? Huh.

16:13.834 --> 16:16.066
Anyway, she was a model.

16:16.100 --> 16:18.033
Everybody thought
that she was dumb,

16:18.067 --> 16:20.368
but she wasn't.

16:22.367 --> 16:25.333
Anyway...
she was so beautiful

16:25.367 --> 16:28.567
that all the boys
in Fairyland wanted her.

16:28.601 --> 16:31.467
You know, like
Prince Charming and...

16:31.501 --> 16:34.033
the guy with the pies
and the sheep...

16:34.067 --> 16:37.300
the guy shaped
like an egg...

16:37.334 --> 16:40.900
Dopey and Zeppo...

16:40.934 --> 16:42.400
Curly and Moe,

16:42.434 --> 16:45.366
and the other dwarfs,
et cetera.

16:45.400 --> 16:48.366
But instead of going
to the fairy dance,

16:48.400 --> 16:49.633
she had to babysit

16:49.667 --> 16:53.433
a bunch of troll-like
snot monsters, who...

16:53.467 --> 16:55.999
if one of them
squirts me with that gun,

16:56.033 --> 16:58.366
will die a horrible,
screaming death,

16:58.400 --> 17:01.200
along with his demon-seed
brother and sister Hubbards,

17:01.234 --> 17:04.767
at the hands of
the mighty dragon-beast Buck,

17:04.800 --> 17:08.367
who hasn't eaten
for a thousand years.

17:10.968 --> 17:12.733
The end.

17:12.767 --> 17:15.700
So...what have we learned
from all this?

17:15.733 --> 17:18.468
You die at dawn.

17:25.300 --> 17:26.567
Isn't this
a good movie?

17:26.601 --> 17:29.434
Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah, it's great.

17:30.167 --> 17:32.066
<i>Why did I marry?</i>

17:32.100 --> 17:34.033
<i>All I ever really
wanted to do</i>

17:34.067 --> 17:36.500
<i>was play racquetball
with the guys,</i>

17:36.534 --> 17:39.467
<i>maybe ride a motorcycle
across country,</i>

17:39.501 --> 17:43.434
<i>go to California
and become a porno star.</i>

17:45.234 --> 17:46.567
<i>Ah...</i>

17:46.601 --> 17:49.467
<i>But this is
almost as much fun.</i>

17:49.501 --> 17:51.433
<i>What a life.</i>

17:51.467 --> 17:52.733
<i>Is this it?</i>

17:52.767 --> 17:54.600
<i>Is this the end?</i>

17:54.634 --> 17:58.133
<i>Did it happen last night,
and no one told me?</i>

17:58.167 --> 17:59.800
<i>Gads.</i>

17:59.834 --> 18:01.233
<i>It's Saturday night.</i>

18:01.267 --> 18:03.800
<i>I should be out on the town,
dressed in leopard,</i>

18:03.834 --> 18:09.167
<i>purring like a kitten in Karl
"The Mailman" Malone's lap.</i>

18:10.033 --> 18:14.034
<i>Ah, but this is
almost as much fun.</i>

18:18.868 --> 18:22.234
<i>Hey! Peg would
wanna see this.</i>

18:26.367 --> 18:29.066
<i>I know what</i>

18:29.100 --> 18:32.734
<i>Marcie has the smallest breasts
in the room.</i>

18:33.801 --> 18:36.467
<i>Well, I'm happy about it.
Happy, I tell you.</i>

18:36.501 --> 18:39.633
<i>They are perfectly symmetrical
for my frame.</i>

18:39.667 --> 18:42.333
<i>And I'm happy about it.
Happy, I tell you.</i>

18:42.367 --> 18:44.800
<i>Besides, I'm smart.</i>

18:44.834 --> 18:47.834
<i>I have a big brain.</i>

18:47.868 --> 18:49.900
<i>That's what men really want.</i>

18:49.934 --> 18:51.200
Milk Dud?

18:51.234 --> 18:53.201
Tootsie Roll.

18:58.067 --> 19:01.033
<i>How long is this movie,
an eon?</i>

19:01.067 --> 19:03.834
<i>There isn't a woman under 50
in this film.</i>

19:06.834 --> 19:08.400
<i>About now on Jupiter,</i>

19:08.434 --> 19:12.567
<i>the breast gladiators would be
dueling with the liquid cheese.</i>

19:13.734 --> 19:18.434
<i>But, gee, then I'd be missing
out on all this human feeling.</i>

19:20.734 --> 19:23.267
<i>God, what happened to me?</i>

19:24.200 --> 19:26.867
<i>When I was young, I would have
beat the hell out of him</i>

19:26.901 --> 19:29.800
<i>and made his wife
hold my jacket.</i>

19:29.834 --> 19:33.700
<i>And here I am
hanging out with them.</i>

19:33.734 --> 19:36.500
<i>God, I was great
when I was a kid.</i>

19:36.534 --> 19:38.333
<i>A football hero.</i>

19:38.367 --> 19:42.667
<i>Young, strong, fast,
indestructible.</i>

19:44.667 --> 19:46.600
<i>* Memories *</i>

19:46.634 --> 19:49.900
<i>* Of the world
I left behind *</i>

19:49.934 --> 19:52.867
<i>* Misty, water-colored
Memories *</i>

19:52.901 --> 19:56.234
<i>* Of the way we were *</i>

19:56.801 --> 19:59.467
<i>* Shattered pictures *</i>

19:59.501 --> 20:03.633
<i>* Of the smiles
I left behind *</i>

20:03.667 --> 20:08.233
<i>* Smiles we gave
To one another *</i>

20:08.267 --> 20:12.800
<i>* For the way we were *</i>

20:12.834 --> 20:19.133
<i>* Can it be that it was
All so simple then? *</i>

20:19.167 --> 20:24.934
<i>* Or has time
Rewritten every line? *</i>

20:24.968 --> 20:29.300
<i>* If we had the chance
To do it all again *</i>

20:29.334 --> 20:33.066
<i>* Tell me, would we? *</i>

20:33.100 --> 20:36.334
<i>* Could we? *</i>

20:37.467 --> 20:40.733
<i>* Memories *</i>

20:40.767 --> 20:44.867
<i>* May be beautiful
And yet *</i>

20:44.901 --> 20:50.300
<i>* What's too painful
To remember *</i>

20:50.334 --> 20:55.200
<i>* We simply choose
To forget *</i>

20:55.234 --> 20:59.266
<i>* So it's the laughter *</i>

20:59.300 --> 21:02.999
<i>* We will remember *</i>

21:03.033 --> 21:07.900
<i>* Whenever we remember *</i>

21:07.934 --> 21:12.300
<i>* The way we were *</i>

21:12.334 --> 21:18.967
<i>* The way we were *</i>

21:31.167 --> 21:32.700
Hi, Kel.

21:33.734 --> 21:35.401
The greatest thing.

21:35.934 --> 21:38.099
I got her front row.

21:38.133 --> 21:40.533
I got her backstage.

21:40.567 --> 21:42.867
I got her.

21:46.934 --> 21:49.234
I was so cool!

21:49.601 --> 21:51.867
Could you untie me,
please?

21:51.901 --> 21:53.467
Well, I'm not sure.

21:53.501 --> 21:55.767
Would you be mad if I said
I spent your share of the money

21:55.801 --> 21:57.301
on my date?

21:57.634 --> 21:58.999
I'd kill you.

21:59.033 --> 22:00.934
Well, then...

22:00.968 --> 22:03.400
I'll see you in the morning.

22:03.434 --> 22:05.166
If you need me,
I'll be upstairs.

22:05.200 --> 22:08.201
The bad thing
do make you sleepy.

22:11.601 --> 22:13.234
Oh, god.
