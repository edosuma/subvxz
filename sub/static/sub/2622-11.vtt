WEBVTT

00:02.210 --> 00:06.005
I can't believe
my little brother's married!

00:08.842 --> 00:11.343
Why didn't you tell me
you were eloping?

00:11.511 --> 00:14.263
Well, we were at court,
eating lunch...

00:14.472 --> 00:16.140
Why were you at court?

00:16.766 --> 00:17.975
Lunch.

00:19.602 --> 00:20.853
We were like...

00:21.104 --> 00:25.274
...we're here, we're having lunch.
Let's get married! Right?

00:25.483 --> 00:29.862
A year ago, I didn't know I had
a brother. Now I have a sister!

00:33.116 --> 00:34.950
Oh, it's so great.

00:37.746 --> 00:40.956
Okay.

00:42.000 --> 00:43.375
Stop it! Don't!

00:45.336 --> 00:47.004
I'll get you a gift now.

00:47.255 --> 00:49.339
Is there anything you need?

00:49.507 --> 00:51.300
Uh, yeah.

00:52.802 --> 00:57.806
We've been trying to get pregnant.
Thought we'd get a jump on things.

00:58.683 --> 01:00.768
No one's getting any younger. Ha-ha-ha.

01:02.270 --> 01:06.774
Because the thing is, um, we're not
able to, you know, uh, conceive.

01:06.983 --> 01:09.276
We've seen a bunch of doctors.

01:09.486 --> 01:12.571
They say that our only chance
to have a baby...

01:12.822 --> 01:17.910
...is that if they take my sperm,
her egg, put it together in a dish...

01:18.161 --> 01:20.162
...and put it into another girl.

01:20.371 --> 01:24.083
We were wondering
if you could be that girl.

01:28.505 --> 01:30.089
That's a really nice gift.

01:32.675 --> 01:34.551
I was thinking of a gravy boat.

02:25.728 --> 02:28.981
Check it out!
Guess what job I just got.

02:31.442 --> 02:35.612
I don't know, but Donald Trump
wants his blue blazer black.

02:36.781 --> 02:37.823
What?

02:38.241 --> 02:41.910
Blue blazer back.
He wants it back.

02:42.912 --> 02:46.623
You said "black." Why would he
want his blue blazer black?

02:48.418 --> 02:50.210
Well, you know what I meant.

02:50.420 --> 02:51.753
You messed it up.

02:53.464 --> 02:55.299
You're stupid.

02:58.178 --> 02:59.928
So what job'd you get?

03:00.430 --> 03:03.265
Tour guide at the museum.
Ross got it for me.

03:03.433 --> 03:06.685
Don't you have to be
a dinosaur expert?

03:06.895 --> 03:09.271
They give you
all the information.

03:09.480 --> 03:11.857
It's like memorizing a script.

03:12.066 --> 03:16.528
On your left, tyrannosaurus rex,
from the Jurassic Period.

03:16.779 --> 03:18.405
Very nice.

03:18.615 --> 03:22.159
Yeah, actually, Joey,
it's the Cretaceous Period.

03:23.786 --> 03:26.121
But I can pronounce Jurassic.

03:27.123 --> 03:28.123
Hey!

03:28.374 --> 03:31.210
Frank Jr. And Alice got married!

03:31.794 --> 03:33.295
Oh, my God!

03:33.463 --> 03:34.880
They're having a baby!

03:36.841 --> 03:40.052
They want me to grow it
for them in my uterus!

03:43.806 --> 03:45.891
- My God!
- Are you serious?

03:46.059 --> 03:47.100
Yeah.

03:47.268 --> 03:50.646
You're thinking of
having sex with your brother?

03:53.733 --> 03:56.318
Ew! And, oh, no!

03:56.653 --> 03:58.820
They want me to be the surrogate.

03:59.030 --> 04:03.158
It's her egg and his sperm.
I'm the oven. It's their bun.

04:04.827 --> 04:06.119
What did you say?

04:06.329 --> 04:10.332
I had to think about it,
but what is there to think of?

04:10.500 --> 04:13.835
I'll be giving someone
the greatest gift.

04:14.045 --> 04:18.257
You'll carry their child,
and get them a Sony PlayStation?

04:19.759 --> 04:22.261
This is an incredible thing to do.

04:22.470 --> 04:25.138
But there are things to think about.

04:25.348 --> 04:28.684
Yeah, you'd be pregnant.
I mean pregnant.

04:29.310 --> 04:30.894
I know.

04:32.021 --> 04:35.065
You'll put your body
through an awful lot.

04:35.316 --> 04:38.652
I mean, morning sickness, uh, labor.

04:38.861 --> 04:40.487
It's all for somebody else.

04:40.697 --> 04:42.531
Yeah. What's your point?

04:43.324 --> 04:46.159
Well, the stuff I just mentioned.

04:47.370 --> 04:48.704
I couldn't do that.

04:48.955 --> 04:53.709
I figure, the first time I had a baby,
it'd be with someone I love.

04:53.918 --> 04:55.627
And that baby was, you know...

04:55.878 --> 04:57.421
...a keeper.

04:58.131 --> 05:02.634
You were more supportive when
I wanted to make denim furniture.

05:02.885 --> 05:06.680
If you decide to do this,
we'll be supportive like crazy.

05:06.889 --> 05:08.390
Just think it through.

05:08.558 --> 05:11.727
Talk to somebody who's had a baby.
Like your mom.

05:12.020 --> 05:16.815
My mom never gave birth.
Oh! But my birth mom did!

05:23.197 --> 05:27.200
I love this tushy!
Can I take it to work with me?

05:27.577 --> 05:31.538
Yeah, sure. It's not mine anyway.
It came with the pants.

05:36.753 --> 05:38.211
I am so jealous.

05:38.421 --> 05:40.922
You guys are just right there.

05:41.257 --> 05:42.299
Yes.

05:43.634 --> 05:44.760
Right where?

05:45.928 --> 05:49.848
The beginning, where
it's all sex and talking...

05:50.099 --> 05:52.642
...and sex and talking.

05:53.019 --> 05:55.020
You got to love the talking.

05:56.481 --> 05:57.522
And the sex?

05:57.732 --> 05:59.066
We haven't had sex.

06:00.276 --> 06:02.569
What's the big deal?
This is special.

06:02.779 --> 06:06.573
I want our love to grow
before moving to the next level.

06:06.991 --> 06:09.242
Oh, Chandler, that is so nice.

06:09.452 --> 06:11.286
That is really nice...

06:11.454 --> 06:12.954
...lying!

06:14.374 --> 06:17.125
- No way is that the reason.
- Why?

06:17.293 --> 06:20.295
You're not mature enough
to understand that!

06:20.588 --> 06:22.672
He's right. I'm totally lying.

06:27.762 --> 06:28.970
Then what is it?

06:29.138 --> 06:31.264
Kathy's last boyfriend was Joey.

06:31.724 --> 06:36.812
And you're afraid you won't
be able to fill his shoes?

06:38.856 --> 06:41.983
I'm afraid I won't
make love as well as him.

06:42.860 --> 06:44.694
I was going for the metaphor.

06:44.862 --> 06:46.780
I was saying the actual words.

06:48.574 --> 06:51.993
He's had girlfriends.
It doesn't mean he's great in bed.

06:52.578 --> 06:53.995
We share a wall.

06:56.749 --> 07:00.627
Either he's great, or she liked
to agree with him a lot.

07:01.754 --> 07:06.383
It'll be different. The sex will be
great because you are in love.

07:07.844 --> 07:08.885
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

07:09.178 --> 07:10.178
Just go for it.

07:10.680 --> 07:11.847
Yeah, you should.

07:12.014 --> 07:14.850
All right. I'll sleep
with my girlfriend.

07:16.102 --> 07:18.478
But I'm just doing it for you guys.

07:21.607 --> 07:26.361
Now, the mastodon is from
the semi-late Jurassic Period.

07:27.864 --> 07:30.365
Isn't the mastodon
from the Pliocene Epoch?

07:30.992 --> 07:32.033
Shh.

07:32.243 --> 07:34.369
This is a museum. No talking.

07:36.038 --> 07:38.039
Right down here we have...

07:38.791 --> 07:40.292
...a large foot.

07:43.713 --> 07:46.798
And over here we have Ross Geller.

07:47.049 --> 07:49.092
Everyone wave "hi" to Ross.

07:49.385 --> 07:52.554
Ross is one of our scientists.
Look at him hard at work.

07:57.894 --> 07:59.561
Okay, moving right along.

07:59.770 --> 08:01.146
Come on.

08:04.942 --> 08:06.902
It's open. Come in.

08:07.820 --> 08:09.821
- I'm sorry I'm late.
- That's okay.

08:10.114 --> 08:12.616
I had time to finish
glazing my nipples.

08:13.993 --> 08:17.078
You go all out
when you're expecting company.

08:18.164 --> 08:19.581
I was working on my pottery.

08:19.916 --> 08:21.583
Oh! Oh!

08:22.126 --> 08:25.921
Oh! I didn't know
that you did pot.

08:27.590 --> 08:32.302
Mostly nudes. It combines
my two passions: Pottery and erotica.

08:32.970 --> 08:34.304
Erottery!

08:34.597 --> 08:36.597
Hey! Okay!

08:36.807 --> 08:38.767
Thanks for coming out to see me.

08:39.018 --> 08:44.022
I thought it'd be a good idea to
talk about this baby stuff in person.

08:45.441 --> 08:47.359
I don't think it's a good idea.

08:48.819 --> 08:50.195
Why not?

08:50.780 --> 08:52.697
You'd be giving up a baby.

08:52.949 --> 08:54.699
And I really don't...

08:54.951 --> 08:56.952
I don't know if anything I say...

08:57.161 --> 09:01.039
...would make you understand the pain
of giving up a baby.

09:01.290 --> 09:02.332
So...

09:05.461 --> 09:09.381
No, no, I understand the pain.
Don't hurt the puppy!

09:10.466 --> 09:12.217
No, no. The puppy is yours.

09:12.635 --> 09:14.761
I get a puppy?

09:14.971 --> 09:16.638
But for only three days.

09:16.973 --> 09:18.223
Why?

09:20.643 --> 09:25.730
I realize I don't have any right
to start getting parenty on you now.

09:31.862 --> 09:35.156
Look at me and not the puppy.
It's very important.

09:36.534 --> 09:38.326
I know what I'm talking about.

09:39.412 --> 09:41.413
I gave up two babies.

09:41.664 --> 09:46.418
I only wish I had someone
who'd given up babies that told me...

09:46.669 --> 09:48.545
...how terrible it is.

09:50.423 --> 09:54.968
It'd be something you'd regret
every day for the rest of your life.

09:56.387 --> 10:00.265
So however hard it is for you
to give up this puppy...

10:00.766 --> 10:04.686
...it'd be a million times harder
to give up a child.

10:07.440 --> 10:10.609
I shouldn't have given you
the puppy first.

10:15.281 --> 10:18.950
Could you sit there? I'm saving
this seat for my friend Ross.

10:19.201 --> 10:20.577
You mean Dr. Geller?

10:20.870 --> 10:23.955
Doctor? I didn't know
he had a nickname.

10:25.374 --> 10:27.167
Oh, he won't sit here.

10:27.376 --> 10:29.461
Only people in white coats
sit there.

10:29.712 --> 10:32.672
Only people in blue blazers
sit here.

10:33.466 --> 10:34.758
How come?

10:34.967 --> 10:36.009
That's how it is.

10:36.802 --> 10:38.178
That's crazy.

10:38.387 --> 10:43.475
It's crazy in a perfect world:
A world without lab coats and blazers.

10:43.809 --> 10:47.103
But you not in a perfect world.
You in a museum now.

10:49.565 --> 10:50.899
See that scientist?

10:51.567 --> 10:56.071
He and I used to play together
in grade school, but now...

10:56.906 --> 10:59.574
Peter! Hey, Peter!

11:00.409 --> 11:03.828
It's me, Rhonda from P.S. 129?

11:04.705 --> 11:07.248
I shared my pudding with you, man!

11:08.751 --> 11:11.503
I gave you my snack pack!

11:12.838 --> 11:16.716
See? He pretend
he don't even hear me!

11:18.094 --> 11:20.762
Everyone's pretending
they don't hear you.

11:22.348 --> 11:26.142
I don't know about your jackets
and separate tables...

11:26.352 --> 11:27.852
...but Ross is my friend.

11:28.104 --> 11:31.147
And if I save him a seat,
he will sit in it.

11:33.484 --> 11:34.818
Ross. Ross.

11:34.985 --> 11:36.736
Here! I saved you a seat!

11:40.324 --> 11:43.451
I'm cool here.
I'll catch up with you later.

11:48.124 --> 11:49.499
This is saved.

11:52.253 --> 11:53.670
Gift shop.

12:02.304 --> 12:05.140
I'm sorry about
what happened today.

12:06.642 --> 12:08.810
You do what you got to do.

12:09.061 --> 12:13.314
The scientists and the tour guides
never sit together.

12:16.485 --> 12:19.279
It's like that everywhere.
Mon, back me up.

12:19.488 --> 12:22.657
Where you work, the waiters
eat with the waiters.

12:22.867 --> 12:25.368
And the chefs eat
with the other chefs?

12:25.661 --> 12:29.998
I eat by myself in the alley,
because everybody hates me.

12:32.293 --> 12:33.918
Look, Ross.

12:34.587 --> 12:35.670
It's no big deal.

12:35.880 --> 12:38.339
You wear a white coat.
I wear a blue blazer.

12:38.591 --> 12:42.302
If that means we can't be
friends at work, so be it.

12:42.511 --> 12:43.928
I understand, you know?

12:44.221 --> 12:48.933
When I'm in a play and you're in
the audience, I don't talk to you.

12:49.852 --> 12:52.187
So it's, you know, it's, uh, cool.

12:52.438 --> 12:53.938
I'll see you tomorrow.

12:57.067 --> 13:00.069
When we're in the audience,
he does wave.

13:09.371 --> 13:11.206
- Hi.
- Hey.

13:13.125 --> 13:15.627
Why's Phoebe singing
to Karl Malden?

13:17.379 --> 13:20.465
I think it's time for puppy
to go out again.

13:20.716 --> 13:22.926
- Come on, let's go to the balcony.
- What?

13:23.135 --> 13:26.346
The street.
Come on, let's go to the street.

13:26.639 --> 13:30.058
Don't go on the balcony
until after I get back.

13:32.478 --> 13:34.062
So did you do it?

13:34.396 --> 13:36.731
Yes, yes, we had the sex.

13:37.399 --> 13:38.983
Uh-oh. It was bad?

13:39.276 --> 13:44.072
It was fine, but she didn't agree
with me as strongly as with Joey.

13:46.450 --> 13:49.619
She was like, uh, "I see your point.
I'm all right with it."

13:51.413 --> 13:55.083
There's not always a lot of agreement
the first time.

13:55.376 --> 13:59.254
Yeah. Not for girls, anyway.
Guys agree like that.

14:00.130 --> 14:02.257
Look, you have to help me.

14:02.508 --> 14:03.633
I mean...

14:03.926 --> 14:08.429
I know what to do with a woman.
It's always nice.

14:08.639 --> 14:09.931
I need to know...

14:10.140 --> 14:12.141
...what makes it go from nice to...

14:12.434 --> 14:15.270
..."My God! Somebody's killing her
in there!"

14:16.146 --> 14:19.440
I'll show you something
a lot of guys don't know.

14:21.193 --> 14:22.443
All right.

14:22.653 --> 14:23.945
Now.

14:24.196 --> 14:27.991
You don't have to draw an actual...
Whoa, she's hot!

14:29.493 --> 14:31.786
Everyone knows the erogenous zones.

14:32.037 --> 14:33.538
You got one, two, three...

14:34.331 --> 14:35.623
...four...

14:36.208 --> 14:38.918
...five, six and seven.

14:39.378 --> 14:40.879
There are seven?

14:41.797 --> 14:43.381
Let me see that.

14:44.133 --> 14:45.466
Oh, yeah.

14:47.761 --> 14:49.262
That's one?

14:49.471 --> 14:51.306
Kind of an important one.

14:52.391 --> 14:54.392
I was looking at it upside down.

14:57.396 --> 14:59.856
Well, you know sometimes that helps.

15:04.987 --> 15:09.824
Most guys will hit one, two, three
and then go to seven and set up camp.

15:12.119 --> 15:13.161
That's bad?

15:13.454 --> 15:17.373
At Disneyland, you don't spend
the whole day on the Matterhorn.

15:17.833 --> 15:20.084
You might if it were like seven.

15:23.088 --> 15:26.174
The important thing is
to take your time.

15:26.425 --> 15:28.009
You want to hit them all...

15:28.302 --> 15:30.637
...mix them up.
Keep them on their toes.

15:30.846 --> 15:31.971
Oh, toes!

15:38.312 --> 15:39.896
For some people.

15:40.689 --> 15:42.190
All right.

15:42.399 --> 15:45.860
You could, uh, start out
with a little one.

15:46.111 --> 15:47.403
A two.

15:47.655 --> 15:48.905
A one, two, three.

15:49.740 --> 15:50.782
A three.

15:51.992 --> 15:53.326
A five.

15:54.286 --> 15:55.328
A four.

15:55.829 --> 15:57.205
A three, two.

15:57.456 --> 15:59.415
Two. A two, four, six.

16:00.417 --> 16:02.168
Two, four, six.

16:02.378 --> 16:04.045
Four. Two.

16:04.630 --> 16:06.923
Two. Four, seven!

16:08.217 --> 16:10.718
Five, seven! Six, seven!

16:10.886 --> 16:13.304
Seven! Seven!

16:13.597 --> 16:15.390
Seven, seven, seven!

16:17.226 --> 16:18.559
Seven!

16:32.783 --> 16:35.118
Dr. Geller? There's a seat here.

16:36.078 --> 16:38.579
Thank you, Dr. Phillips.

16:38.789 --> 16:40.456
But I'm having my lunch...

16:40.666 --> 16:43.835
...at this table.
Here in the middle.

16:44.586 --> 16:45.753
I'm eating...

16:45.921 --> 16:49.799
...right here
with my good friend, Joey.

16:50.467 --> 16:51.968
If he'll sit with me.

16:57.599 --> 16:59.600
I will sit with you, Dr. Geller.

17:04.772 --> 17:05.940
You know...

17:06.150 --> 17:09.609
...we work in a museum
of natural history.

17:10.279 --> 17:12.363
And yet, there is something...

17:12.614 --> 17:14.115
...unnatural...

17:15.367 --> 17:17.117
...about the way we eat lunch.

17:18.787 --> 17:22.999
I look around, and you know what I see?
I see division.

17:23.208 --> 17:28.212
Division between people in white coats
and people in blue blazers.

17:28.464 --> 17:30.673
I ask myself, "My God, why?"

17:32.843 --> 17:35.845
Now, I say we shed these coats...

17:36.096 --> 17:37.764
...that separate us.

17:38.807 --> 17:41.976
And we get to know
the people underneath.

17:45.189 --> 17:46.272
I'm Ross!

17:46.940 --> 17:49.776
I'm divorced and I have a kid!

17:55.991 --> 17:58.367
I'm Joey! I'm an actor!

17:59.119 --> 18:01.871
I don't know squat about dinosaurs!

18:04.458 --> 18:09.587
I'm Ted, and I just moved here,
and New York really scares me.

18:09.838 --> 18:12.757
- There you go!
- Hang in there, Teddy!

18:14.051 --> 18:15.510
I'm Andrew.

18:16.095 --> 18:18.471
And I didn't pay for this pear.

18:20.599 --> 18:22.391
Okay. Good for you.

18:23.185 --> 18:27.438
I'm Rhonda!
And these aren't real!

18:31.860 --> 18:33.569
Wow, Rhonda.

18:35.614 --> 18:38.324
- I'm Scott.
- Yeah, okay, Scott!

18:39.076 --> 18:43.579
I flip the light switch on and off
17 times when I leave a room...

18:43.789 --> 18:45.248
...or my family will die.

18:49.503 --> 18:51.129
My mom will be here soon.

18:51.380 --> 18:53.714
I can't. I can't give him up.

18:54.842 --> 18:56.509
Yes, no. I can.

18:57.136 --> 18:58.386
I don't want to.

18:59.096 --> 19:00.471
But I can.

19:01.223 --> 19:02.265
No.

19:03.183 --> 19:06.561
I can't watch this.
It's like Sophie's Choice.

19:07.855 --> 19:09.856
You know, I never saw that.

19:10.065 --> 19:12.150
Oh, it was only okay.

19:13.527 --> 19:15.319
I can't do this.

19:16.071 --> 19:19.699
My mom was right.
If I can't give him up...

19:19.950 --> 19:22.201
...there's no way
I can give up a baby.

19:23.287 --> 19:26.455
Frank and Alice
are going to be so crushed.

19:26.665 --> 19:30.293
What else can I give them?
A kidney!

19:34.506 --> 19:36.382
We were in the neighborhood.

19:36.675 --> 19:40.720
We want to let you know that
there's still no pressure.

19:40.888 --> 19:41.929
None.

19:42.181 --> 19:46.601
If there was something you wanted
to say, we'll be right there.

19:47.186 --> 19:48.227
Okay.

19:48.896 --> 19:50.438
Who's this little guy?

19:50.647 --> 19:53.024
Oh, um, well...

19:53.859 --> 19:57.820
He's so cute! He reminds me
of my old dog, Tumor.

20:00.699 --> 20:03.367
You are so precious,
I'd take you home.

20:04.870 --> 20:05.912
Why don't you?

20:06.622 --> 20:07.663
Are you serious?

20:07.873 --> 20:08.998
Uh-huh. Yeah.

20:09.708 --> 20:10.958
Thanks.

20:14.254 --> 20:17.131
- What are you doing?
- I'm okay with this.

20:17.507 --> 20:19.759
You know why?
Because look at them.

20:19.968 --> 20:21.802
Look how happy they are.

20:22.054 --> 20:24.931
And I made that, so you know...

20:27.392 --> 20:31.437
...it'll be a million times harder
to give up a baby. But God!

20:31.688 --> 20:34.398
It'll feel a million times
better, right?

20:36.068 --> 20:38.861
I'll do this.
I want to carry your baby.

20:39.696 --> 20:42.907
Oh!

20:43.784 --> 20:45.493
Thank you so much!

20:46.036 --> 20:48.496
You don't know what this means to us.

20:50.249 --> 20:52.333
I think I'm going to cry!

20:57.839 --> 20:59.757
It's going to be so great.

21:00.926 --> 21:01.968
Hi.

21:02.844 --> 21:05.513
- What's going on?
- I gave them the puppy.

21:05.722 --> 21:09.600
It made them so happy,
I decided to carry their baby.

21:10.269 --> 21:12.186
- Phoebe...
- No, I know.

21:12.396 --> 21:14.063
We're different, though.

21:14.314 --> 21:16.565
This is a different situation.

21:16.817 --> 21:19.193
I am not going to regret this.

21:19.778 --> 21:22.280
I understand all that.

21:22.698 --> 21:24.824
It's just, that was my puppy.

21:24.992 --> 21:26.033
Oh!

21:31.248 --> 21:32.999
Would you ever be a surrogate?

21:33.458 --> 21:34.709
Depends who asked.

21:35.502 --> 21:36.627
What if I asked?

21:37.296 --> 21:39.463
Oh, Mon, sure!

21:39.673 --> 21:41.924
- Really?
- Yes.

21:45.679 --> 21:47.805
- You're not asking me, are you?
- No.

21:48.432 --> 21:50.182
Yes. Totally.

21:54.396 --> 21:57.064
Thank you! Thank you!

21:57.482 --> 21:58.524
Thank you!

21:58.900 --> 22:00.693
Yes, thank you!
