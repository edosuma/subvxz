00:20.153 --> 00:22.621
Regeneration cycle incomplete.

03:28.007 --> 03:30.669
When l checked
the overnight sensor logs,

03:30.743 --> 03:33.211
this little surprise
was waiting for me.

03:33.279 --> 03:35.406
Maybe l'm not quite awake,

03:35.481 --> 03:39.110
but it looks like its
over 100 kilometers wide.

03:39.185 --> 03:42.120
120. At first, l thought
it was an asteroid cluster

03:42.188 --> 03:46.056
until l picked up
a residual warp signature.

03:46.125 --> 03:48.616
lt was a Borg vessel.

03:48.695 --> 03:50.959
There are tetryon particles
in the debris consistent

03:51.064 --> 03:52.725
with the atmosphere
inside a cube.

03:52.799 --> 03:54.494
Any idea what destroyed it?

03:54.567 --> 03:56.967
We would need to run
close-range scans

03:57.070 --> 03:58.469
of the hull fragments.

03:58.538 --> 04:00.597
Unless we alter course,
we'll get our chance.

04:00.707 --> 04:02.368
The debris field's
directly ahead.

04:02.442 --> 04:04.069
Then l suggest
we cut a wide berth.

04:04.143 --> 04:07.635
Chances are the Borg will send
more vessels to investigate.

04:07.714 --> 04:09.204
Alter course
to avoid the debris.

04:09.282 --> 04:10.374
lf that's all...

04:10.450 --> 04:13.112
One other piece
of business, Captain.

04:13.186 --> 04:14.414
lt seems we had another incident

04:14.487 --> 04:15.545
in the Mess Hall last night.

04:15.622 --> 04:17.522
Return of the midnight snacker?

04:17.589 --> 04:18.887
l'm afraid so.

04:19.024 --> 04:20.117
Casualties?

04:20.192 --> 04:21.887
A leg of Kelaran wildebeest
l'd prepared

04:21.995 --> 04:23.656
for Ensign Ryson's birthday.

04:23.730 --> 04:25.698
Since Commander Tuvok
has been unable

04:25.765 --> 04:28.359
to round up any suspects,
l'd like to ask

04:28.468 --> 04:30.095
that stronger measures be taken.

04:30.203 --> 04:31.830
Perhaps
an armed security detail...

04:31.938 --> 04:33.872
l'd like to ask permission
to replicate

04:33.940 --> 04:36.374
some locking mechanisms
for the cabinet doors.

04:36.442 --> 04:37.431
Granted.

04:37.543 --> 04:38.908
Dismissed.

05:29.128 --> 05:31.460
Naomi Wildman,

05:31.531 --> 05:33.362
Subunit of Ensign
Samantha Wildman,

05:33.433 --> 05:34.559
state your intentions.

05:34.634 --> 05:35.999
l...

05:38.004 --> 05:39.494
Very well.
You leave me no choice

05:39.605 --> 05:42.199
but to report your activities
to the Captain.

05:42.308 --> 05:43.536
Please don't.

05:43.609 --> 05:45.702
l was just observing you.

05:45.778 --> 05:47.177
Explain.

05:47.246 --> 05:49.578
Well, Neelix told
me that the Borg

05:49.649 --> 05:51.082
do a lot of things they do

05:51.150 --> 05:52.811
because they're trying
to be perfect

05:52.885 --> 05:54.910
and, even though you're
not really a drone anymore,

05:54.987 --> 05:56.318
you still try to be perfect.

05:56.389 --> 05:57.321
Don't you?

05:57.390 --> 05:58.721
Correct.

05:58.791 --> 06:00.486
Well, if l can learn
to be perfect, too,

06:00.560 --> 06:01.492
then Captain Janeway

06:01.561 --> 06:03.256
will have to make me
her Bridge Assistant.

06:03.329 --> 06:05.627
No such rank exists
aboard this vessel.

06:05.698 --> 06:07.131
Not yet.

06:07.200 --> 06:10.658
And you hope to achieve
this goal by emulating me?

06:10.770 --> 06:11.998
Are you mad?

06:12.105 --> 06:14.073
No.
There are many on this crew

06:14.140 --> 06:16.165
that would benefit
from your example.

06:16.275 --> 06:18.368
So you'll teach me.

06:18.444 --> 06:19.877
Your objective is admirable.

06:20.012 --> 06:22.776
However, your neocortical
development is incomplete.

06:22.849 --> 06:25.784
You would require several
months of accelerated growth

06:25.852 --> 06:27.410
in a Borg maturation chamber.

06:27.487 --> 06:30.888
Oh... l don't think
l like the sound of that.

06:30.957 --> 06:32.254
Then l suggest that yo...

06:40.533 --> 06:43.297
-Hi.
-Hi.

06:43.403 --> 06:46.236
l'm bored.
Let's do something fun.

06:46.305 --> 06:47.465
Like what?

06:47.573 --> 06:49.473
Swimming?

06:49.542 --> 06:52.477
Oh, l'm not allowed
to go swimming without my mom.

06:52.545 --> 06:54.445
Oh.

06:54.514 --> 06:56.106
Do you like Kadis-Kot?

06:56.182 --> 06:57.410
Love it.

06:57.483 --> 06:58.450
Come on.

07:01.954 --> 07:04.013
l'll be Bridge Assistant
for a while

07:04.090 --> 07:05.990
then, l'll be promoted
to Ensign.

07:06.058 --> 07:07.821
lt'll be Lieutenant after that,

07:07.894 --> 07:10.590
and by the time we reach
the Alpha Quadrant...

07:10.663 --> 07:12.528
Captain Wildman.

07:14.300 --> 07:17.292
Green, grid 14-4.

07:17.403 --> 07:18.631
Kadis-Kot. l win.

07:20.072 --> 07:21.403
You're really good at this game.

07:21.474 --> 07:22.839
You want a rematch?

07:22.909 --> 07:23.876
Sure.

07:23.976 --> 07:26.137
Captains don't have much time
to play, you know.

07:26.212 --> 07:27.440
That's okay.

07:27.513 --> 07:28.810
l'll be pretty busy by then.

07:28.881 --> 07:30.781
Want to hear the rules
of first contact?

07:30.850 --> 07:32.317
No.

07:32.385 --> 07:34.353
How about the suborders
of the Prime Directive?

07:34.420 --> 07:35.648
l know all 47 of them.

07:35.721 --> 07:37.882
You study too much, Naomi.

07:38.024 --> 07:39.992
Just like my brother.

07:40.059 --> 07:41.754
l didn't know you had a brother.

07:41.828 --> 07:43.295
Mm-hmm. 12 of them.

07:43.362 --> 07:44.351
Twelve?

07:44.430 --> 07:46.364
Nine older and three younger.

07:46.432 --> 07:47.899
We play Kadis-Kot all the time.

07:48.034 --> 07:50.434
l only have my mom
and Neelix to play with--

07:50.503 --> 07:51.902
when they're not working.

07:51.971 --> 07:53.495
You must get lonely.

07:53.606 --> 07:57.064
A little. You get used to it.

07:57.176 --> 07:58.370
You adapt.

07:58.444 --> 07:59.911
Adapt?

08:00.012 --> 08:01.639
You know, like the Borg.

08:01.714 --> 08:05.241
Borg... l hate Borgs.

08:05.318 --> 08:06.910
You do?

08:06.986 --> 08:08.817
Yeah. They're mean.

08:08.921 --> 08:10.548
Torres to Seven of Nine.

08:10.623 --> 08:12.386
Please report to Engineering.

08:12.458 --> 08:13.425
lt's your move.

08:15.394 --> 08:17.726
Seven, respond.

08:20.867 --> 08:22.164
l'm on my way, Lieutenant.

08:23.803 --> 08:25.031
Naomi Wildman...

08:25.137 --> 08:26.695
Yes?

08:26.806 --> 08:28.706
what am l doing here?

08:28.774 --> 08:31.470
We're playing Kadis-Kot.

08:33.813 --> 08:35.144
Seven?

08:50.029 --> 08:51.997
Take a look at this, will you?

08:52.064 --> 08:56.023
l'm picking up an energy signal
in the lower subspace bands

08:56.135 --> 08:59.195
and if l'm not mistaken,
it's got a Borg modulation.

08:59.305 --> 09:00.431
You're correct.

09:00.540 --> 09:01.802
lt is Borg.

09:01.941 --> 09:04.205
l believe it's
a neural interlink frequency.

09:04.277 --> 09:05.369
A what?

09:05.444 --> 09:08.845
A frequency that integrates
the minds of Borg drones.

09:09.982 --> 09:12.177
Can you pinpoint the origin?

09:12.251 --> 09:13.616
l will try.

09:15.321 --> 09:18.916
No offense, Seven,
but you look terrible.

09:18.991 --> 09:20.481
l am not well.

09:20.560 --> 09:22.653
l experienced
a brief lapse in memory

09:22.728 --> 09:24.286
and l am disoriented.

09:24.363 --> 09:25.762
Maybe you should
get to Sick Bay.

09:25.831 --> 09:27.230
No.

09:27.300 --> 09:28.995
This interlink frequency
could explain m...

09:40.379 --> 09:42.643
Do-raQ me'roch.

09:42.715 --> 09:44.307
l beg your pardon?

09:45.451 --> 09:48.011
l am the son of K'Vok.

09:48.087 --> 09:49.111
And you?

09:49.188 --> 09:50.587
What house are you from?

09:50.656 --> 09:52.749
ls this some kind of a joke?

09:52.825 --> 09:56.886
You wear the uniform
of a Starfleet puH-chaH.

09:56.996 --> 09:59.829
What kind of a warrior are you?

09:59.899 --> 10:02.231
Tom put you up to this,
didn't he?

10:02.335 --> 10:03.768
Well, it didn't work.

10:07.173 --> 10:08.800
Come, warrior,
let me look at you.

10:08.908 --> 10:10.375
Enough, Seven.

10:11.611 --> 10:12.737
Your blood is sweet!

10:16.749 --> 10:17.681
Torres to Security.

10:17.750 --> 10:19.479
Get somebody down here
right now.

10:19.552 --> 10:21.042
You are strong.

10:21.120 --> 10:22.451
You will make an excellent mate.

10:22.521 --> 10:24.352
Get the hell away from me!

10:24.423 --> 10:26.857
You wish to prove yourself
in battle.

10:34.166 --> 10:35.394
Report.

10:35.501 --> 10:37.696
Seven of Nine attacked
B'Elanna in Engineering.

10:37.803 --> 10:39.327
She's on Deck 9, Section 23.

10:39.438 --> 10:40.837
Force fields.

10:40.906 --> 10:43.204
Don't tell me those two
have actually come to blows.

10:49.148 --> 10:51.139
Bridge to Tuvok.

10:51.217 --> 10:54.880
Seven's been contained--
Deck 10, Section 32.

10:54.954 --> 10:55.886
Acknowledged.

10:55.955 --> 10:57.217
We're nearing her position.

11:00.426 --> 11:02.951
Seven?

11:04.463 --> 11:06.556
Somebody's hurt
and he needs help.

11:10.770 --> 11:12.897
Did l do something bad?

11:13.005 --> 11:14.836
Who are you?

11:14.907 --> 11:17.273
My name's Maryl.

11:17.343 --> 11:19.903
Are you a Vulcan?

11:19.979 --> 11:23.437
Computer,
deactivate force field.

11:28.554 --> 11:29.782
Give me the phaser.

11:38.097 --> 11:39.894
You are not a physician,
Commander.

11:39.965 --> 11:41.830
The logical course of action

11:41.934 --> 11:44.960
would be to take him
to the infirmary.

11:45.137 --> 11:47.002
Maryl?

11:47.139 --> 11:49.733
Subaltern Lorot,
Vulcan High Command.

11:49.842 --> 11:51.503
May l be of assistance?

11:51.577 --> 11:52.805
Yes.

11:52.878 --> 11:55.506
Please accompany me to Sick Bay.

11:55.581 --> 11:58.141
Certainly.

11:58.217 --> 11:59.616
Clearly he was attacked.

11:59.685 --> 12:02.017
l suggest we use caution.

12:04.590 --> 12:06.023
pahtk!

12:06.092 --> 12:10.028
You will drown
in your own blood.

12:10.096 --> 12:11.996
Keep moving.

12:28.147 --> 12:30.172
Seven?

12:30.249 --> 12:32.513
Captain, why am l here?

12:32.585 --> 12:34.382
You've been unconscious
for nearly two hours.

12:34.453 --> 12:38.082
We believe you're experiencing
a neurological disorder.

12:38.157 --> 12:40.625
Voices... l hear voices...

12:40.693 --> 12:41.625
Describe them.

12:42.795 --> 12:44.956
They are agitated...

12:45.097 --> 12:48.260
chaotic...

12:48.367 --> 12:49.891
too many voices.

13:01.714 --> 13:03.443
Too many voices!

13:04.784 --> 13:08.686
The cortical inhibitor
is destabilizing.

13:08.754 --> 13:12.520
l'm increasing the
neurotransmitter levels.

13:12.591 --> 13:14.388
lt's working.

13:14.460 --> 13:16.325
Do you still hear the voices?

13:16.395 --> 13:18.158
They are fading.

13:20.900 --> 13:23.698
They are gone.

13:23.803 --> 13:25.532
All right.
Let's see what we can do

13:25.638 --> 13:27.105
to keep them from coming back.

13:27.206 --> 13:29.037
What's the last thing
you remember?

13:30.976 --> 13:33.911
l was in Engineering
assisting Lieutenant Torres.

13:33.979 --> 13:35.412
You have no recollection

13:35.481 --> 13:37.540
of a confrontation
with B'Elanna?

13:37.616 --> 13:38.548
Confrontation?

13:38.617 --> 13:39.606
l'm not sure why,

13:39.685 --> 13:41.676
but you seem to be manifesting

13:41.754 --> 13:44.052
personalities
other than your own.

13:44.123 --> 13:46.956
Naomi Wildman claims
the two of you played together

13:47.059 --> 13:48.959
for nearly an hour
this afternoon.

13:49.028 --> 13:51.053
You also attacked
Lieutenant Torres.

13:51.130 --> 13:53.758
She told us you called
yourself ''son of K'Vok''

13:53.833 --> 13:56.563
and that you initiated
a Klingon mating ritual.

13:57.703 --> 13:59.261
l have no memory
of those events.

13:59.371 --> 14:00.633
Come look at this.

14:00.739 --> 14:01.797
Doctor?

14:01.874 --> 14:04.240
This is your neural pattern.

14:04.310 --> 14:06.870
The memory engrams
and synaptic pathways

14:07.012 --> 14:09.173
that define you
as an individual.

14:09.248 --> 14:11.307
Unfortunately, you're not alone.

14:11.383 --> 14:13.681
13 new neural patterns
have emerged

14:13.752 --> 14:15.276
in your cerebral cortex--

14:15.354 --> 14:18.790
Klingon, Vulcan,
Terrelian, human

14:18.858 --> 14:20.382
and several others
l can't identify.

14:20.459 --> 14:21.391
How?

14:21.460 --> 14:23.052
They're coming
from within you.

14:23.128 --> 14:24.459
During your time
with the Borg,

14:24.530 --> 14:27.090
the collective assimilated
hundreds of different species.

14:27.166 --> 14:29.157
All of those neural patterns
were integrated

14:29.268 --> 14:30.428
into the hive mind.

14:30.536 --> 14:31.503
Of course.

14:31.604 --> 14:34.198
That means
they're in your mind, too,

14:34.306 --> 14:36.638
stored
within your cortical implants...

14:36.709 --> 14:38.142
dormant until now.

14:38.210 --> 14:39.370
From what we can tell,

14:39.445 --> 14:42.346
the various neural patterns
are surfacing randomly.

14:42.414 --> 14:45.281
ln essence, you've developed
the Borg equivalent

14:45.351 --> 14:47.319
of multiple personality
disorder.

14:48.387 --> 14:50.947
Can you correct
the malfunction?

14:51.023 --> 14:53.685
The cortical inhibitor
is suppressing the effect,

14:53.759 --> 14:55.693
but it's only
a temporary measure.

14:56.896 --> 14:59.956
Lieutenant Torres detected
a Borg interlink frequency.

15:00.032 --> 15:00.964
lt could be causing

15:01.000 --> 15:02.524
my cortical implants
to malfunction.

15:02.601 --> 15:04.034
The signal appears
to be emanating

15:04.103 --> 15:06.196
from the Borg debris field
we discovered this morning.

15:06.305 --> 15:08.637
Maybe we should jump to warp--
try to get out of range.

15:08.707 --> 15:10.402
The signal permeates subspace.

15:10.476 --> 15:11.602
We cannot avoid it.

15:11.677 --> 15:13.645
Our only hope is
to terminate the signal

15:13.712 --> 15:14.872
at its point of origin.

15:14.947 --> 15:17.245
Set a course for
the debris field.

15:17.316 --> 15:19.580
When we arrive,
we may need your help.

15:19.652 --> 15:20.880
Feel up to it?

15:21.020 --> 15:22.453
Yes, Captain.

15:22.521 --> 15:24.318
Keep a close eye on her, Doctor,

15:24.390 --> 15:27.154
in case she has any more
unexpected visitors.

15:34.600 --> 15:36.465
Has any drone ever
experienced symptoms

15:36.568 --> 15:37.535
like these before?

15:37.603 --> 15:39.798
The collective does not
tolerate imperfection.

15:39.905 --> 15:42.237
Any drone with a malfunction
as serious as mine

15:42.308 --> 15:43.775
would be destroyed immediately.

15:43.876 --> 15:46.777
Lucky for you, this crew
is a little more tolerant.

15:46.845 --> 15:48.176
Oh, there you are.

15:48.247 --> 15:51.182
Lieutenant Torres tells me
you're under the weather.

15:51.250 --> 15:52.512
Correct.

15:52.584 --> 15:53.642
Well, is there anything

15:53.719 --> 15:55.448
your morale officer
can do to help?

15:55.521 --> 15:58.183
Assignments you need me to
finish while you recuperate?

15:58.257 --> 15:59.349
No.

15:59.425 --> 16:01.188
l have some wonderful
medicinal teas.

16:01.293 --> 16:03.022
Maybe l could
prepare one for you.

16:03.062 --> 16:04.051
Talaxian homeopathy.

16:04.129 --> 16:06.427
l don't think we're quite
that desperate yet.

16:06.498 --> 16:08.523
How about if l make one of
your favorite nutritional...?

16:08.600 --> 16:10.295
Your concern has been noted.

16:10.402 --> 16:12.529
The Doctor will inform you
when l am functional again.

16:12.638 --> 16:14.162
Right. Sorry.

16:14.273 --> 16:16.833
Oh, uh...
l almost forgot--

16:16.942 --> 16:18.876
it's from Naomi Wildman.

16:20.813 --> 16:22.075
lt's a drawing of Voyager.

16:23.515 --> 16:25.039
Or maybe it's an asteroid belt.

16:25.117 --> 16:27.517
l'm not sure.

16:27.586 --> 16:30.111
Naomi thought that it
might make you feel better.

16:31.623 --> 16:33.614
Tell her thank you.

16:45.871 --> 16:47.270
l suspected as much.

16:47.339 --> 16:51.332
There were several interruptions
in your regeneration cycle.

16:51.443 --> 16:53.911
18 minutes,
five minutes, one hour.

16:53.979 --> 16:55.742
l don't recall them.

16:55.814 --> 16:57.873
Let's examine
your neural function logs.

16:57.950 --> 17:00.043
Low serotonin levels
during regeneration.

17:00.119 --> 17:01.381
That's normal.

17:01.453 --> 17:04.286
But look at these spikes
in the prefrontal synapses.

17:04.356 --> 17:07.154
They appear only seconds
before you left the alcove.

17:07.226 --> 17:08.386
You were sleepwalking.

17:08.460 --> 17:10.723
l don't remember entering
this data file.

17:10.796 --> 17:13.959
Looks like we found the identity
of the midnight snacker.

17:14.032 --> 17:16.023
l'm sure Mr. Neelix
will be relieved.

17:16.135 --> 17:21.163
Personal Log, Ensign Stone,
Stardate 52188.7.

17:21.272 --> 17:23.400
l just completed my first week
of active duty.

17:23.509 --> 17:24.771
lt was a nightmare.

17:24.843 --> 17:26.367
After four years at the Academy,

17:26.444 --> 17:28.208
l thought
l was ready for anything,

17:28.280 --> 17:30.407
but Captain Blackwood
runs a tight ship

17:30.482 --> 17:32.450
and he seems to take
special pleasure

17:32.518 --> 17:33.883
in tormenting new recruits.

17:33.986 --> 17:36.750
The First Officer tells me
not to take it personally,

17:36.822 --> 17:38.790
but it's hard
to be objective when...

17:38.857 --> 17:40.290
Blackwood.

17:40.359 --> 17:43.658
Captain of the Federation
Starship Tombaugh.

17:43.729 --> 17:47.187
The Borg assimilated
that vessel 13 years ago.

17:47.266 --> 17:49.700
The individual who made
this recording

17:49.802 --> 17:52.066
must have been a member
of the crew.

17:52.171 --> 17:53.638
One of my victims.

17:53.705 --> 17:55.366
Here's another log entry--

17:55.474 --> 17:57.442
this one encoded
for transmission.

17:57.543 --> 17:59.807
Hi. Guess who?

17:59.878 --> 18:02.346
l know l promised
to write you every day,

18:02.448 --> 18:04.040
but that's simply not enough.

18:04.083 --> 18:06.313
How about once in the morning
when l resuscitate

18:06.385 --> 18:08.250
and once at night
before l go into torpor

18:08.320 --> 18:11.448
and l'll think about you
nonstop in between.

18:11.523 --> 18:12.581
Wait. l've got a better idea.

18:12.658 --> 18:15.252
Why don't you leave your circle
and visit the colony?

18:15.327 --> 18:16.726
You'd love it here-- sul...

18:16.795 --> 18:18.160
Anything familiar?

18:18.230 --> 18:21.563
l helped to assimilate
thousands of individuals.

18:21.633 --> 18:23.260
l do not remember
each of their names.

18:23.368 --> 18:25.836
Seven, you were a Borg drone

18:26.004 --> 18:27.767
who's now becoming
an individual.

18:27.840 --> 18:29.330
That's practically unheard of.

18:29.441 --> 18:33.002
There's bound to be rough
spots along the way.

18:33.078 --> 18:35.376
We just have to get past them.

18:35.447 --> 18:37.210
Bridge to Seven of Nine.

18:37.282 --> 18:38.874
We're approaching
the debris field.

18:38.951 --> 18:40.282
Acknowledged.

18:47.092 --> 18:48.252
Survivors?

18:48.327 --> 18:49.453
None.

18:49.528 --> 18:50.825
Any sign of Borg vessels?

18:50.896 --> 18:51.828
No, sir.

18:51.897 --> 18:53.296
We're the first ones here.

18:53.365 --> 18:54.764
l'm picking up the source

18:54.833 --> 18:57.529
of the interlink frequency,
bearing 027 mark 3.

18:57.636 --> 18:58.660
On screen.

19:00.606 --> 19:02.540
Magnify.

19:02.608 --> 19:04.542
lt's a Borg vinculum.

19:04.610 --> 19:07.272
Vinculum?

19:07.346 --> 19:08.677
The processing device

19:08.747 --> 19:10.806
at the core
of every Borg vessel.

19:10.949 --> 19:13.474
lt interconnects
the minds of all the drones.

19:13.552 --> 19:15.042
lt purges individual thoughts

19:15.120 --> 19:18.055
and disseminates information
relevant to the collective.

19:18.123 --> 19:19.454
lt brings order to chaos.

19:19.525 --> 19:20.787
Precisely.

19:20.859 --> 19:23.225
Looks like this one
has established a link

19:23.295 --> 19:24.728
to your cortical implant.

19:24.796 --> 19:27.822
l believe it has identified me
as an errant drone.

19:27.966 --> 19:28.830
lt is attempting

19:29.001 --> 19:30.832
to reintegrate me
into the collective.

19:31.003 --> 19:32.630
The vinculum is malfunctioning.

19:32.738 --> 19:34.569
lt is sending me
erratic commands.

19:34.640 --> 19:37.541
Bringing chaos to order.

19:38.977 --> 19:40.239
Yes.

19:40.312 --> 19:41.870
Can you sever the link?

19:41.980 --> 19:45.347
Not without risking permanent
damage to my own systems.

19:45.417 --> 19:47.612
The vinculum must be
taken off-line.

19:47.686 --> 19:50.814
Permission to beam it aboard
for analysis.

19:50.889 --> 19:53.756
l have worked with
this technology before.

19:53.825 --> 19:55.417
l may be able to disable it.

19:55.494 --> 19:58.463
We're talking about
the heart of a Borg cube.

19:58.530 --> 20:01.055
l'd rather not take it
inside my ship.

20:01.133 --> 20:03.067
Can you disable it remotely?

20:03.168 --> 20:04.635
Yes, but l would need
several days.

20:04.736 --> 20:05.998
The Borg may return by then.

20:06.104 --> 20:08.800
l recommend we take the vinculum

20:08.907 --> 20:11.876
and leave this region
immediately.

20:15.113 --> 20:17.308
Tuvok, prepare to beam it
to Engineering.

20:17.382 --> 20:18.906
Erect a level-10 force field

20:18.984 --> 20:20.884
and maintain constant
surveillance.

20:20.953 --> 20:23.820
The moment it poses a threat,
send it back into space.

20:23.889 --> 20:27.086
Tom, as soon a it's aboard,
get us out of here, warp 9.

20:27.159 --> 20:28.592
Aye, Captain.

20:28.660 --> 20:30.491
l understand
what you're going through

20:30.562 --> 20:32.621
and l want to help you
in every way l can,

20:32.698 --> 20:35.496
but the safety of this crew
is my first responsibility.

20:35.567 --> 20:38.695
We haven't had the best
of luck with the Borg.

20:38.804 --> 20:40.863
Nor have l.

20:47.613 --> 20:49.547
Let's keep on eye
on those antigrav struts.

20:49.615 --> 20:52.015
Boylan, lock out
all primary command consoles

20:52.084 --> 20:55.417
and reroute transporter controls
to Main Engineering.

20:55.487 --> 20:57.284
Yes, Lieutenant.

21:00.359 --> 21:02.054
Seven?

21:02.127 --> 21:04.755
The voices, l hear them.

21:04.830 --> 21:06.855
lt's your proximity
to the vinculum.

21:06.932 --> 21:08.365
The link is stronger here.

21:08.433 --> 21:10.924
l'm adjusting your
neurotransmitter levels.

21:12.404 --> 21:14.463
We better get started.

21:21.713 --> 21:23.442
Don't worry, Lieutenant.

21:23.515 --> 21:26.416
The son of K'Vok
will not be joining us.

21:26.485 --> 21:27.918
Glad to hear it.

21:27.986 --> 21:30.614
Does this qualify
as our second date?

21:30.689 --> 21:33.180
Just think of me
as your chaperon.

21:33.258 --> 21:34.520
So...

21:34.593 --> 21:36.151
where's the off switch?

21:36.228 --> 21:39.129
The vinculum is equipped
with many safeguards.

21:39.197 --> 21:41.461
l will need to access
its transneural matrix

21:41.533 --> 21:42.830
and disable it directly.

21:45.137 --> 21:46.695
l'm reading a power surge.

21:46.805 --> 21:49.296
lt's a normal response
to my intrusion.

21:49.408 --> 21:50.500
Don't be alarmed.

21:52.077 --> 21:53.840
Curious...

21:53.912 --> 21:56.472
l'm detecting an organism
within the vinculum.

21:56.548 --> 21:58.448
lt appears to be a viral agent.

21:58.517 --> 21:59.484
Let's see it.

22:01.086 --> 22:02.883
lt's a synthetic pathogen.

22:02.954 --> 22:05.445
The virus was originally
a biological agent,

22:05.524 --> 22:06.491
but it's mutated.

22:06.558 --> 22:08.458
lt's attacking
the vinculum's programs

22:08.527 --> 22:09.755
as it would living cells.

22:09.828 --> 22:12.388
An organism
that attacks technology?

22:12.464 --> 22:14.455
The cube was infected
three days ago,

22:14.533 --> 22:17.229
shortly after assimilating
an alien shuttlecraft.

22:18.737 --> 22:21.069
Species 6339.

22:21.139 --> 22:23.403
They were the last ones to come
in contact with the cube.

22:23.475 --> 22:25.636
Looks like we've found
our Typhoid Mary.

22:30.682 --> 22:34.345
Species 6339, humanoid.
Warp-capable.

22:34.419 --> 22:38.549
Origin: Grid 124,
Octant 22-Theta.

22:38.623 --> 22:39.817
They first encountered
the Borg

22:39.891 --> 22:40.949
approximately four years ago.

22:41.093 --> 22:43.061
Since that time,
1 1 billion individuals

22:43.128 --> 22:44.618
have been assimilated.

22:44.696 --> 22:46.789
Three days ago,
the collective detected

22:46.865 --> 22:48.958
one of their last
surviving shuttlecraft.

22:49.101 --> 22:50.432
A cube was sent
to intercept it.

22:50.535 --> 22:53.265
We believe the virus
was carried within their bodies.

22:53.372 --> 22:56.102
Once they were assimilated,
it spread to the vinculum.

22:56.174 --> 22:57.869
The drones aboard no doubt

22:57.943 --> 23:00.503
experienced symptoms
similar to my own.

23:00.579 --> 23:03.673
lt is no surprise
they destroyed themselves.

23:03.749 --> 23:06.547
l'd like to find Species 6339.

23:06.618 --> 23:09.109
They may be able
to help us treat you.

23:09.187 --> 23:11.314
Begin long-range
astrometric scans.

23:11.390 --> 23:13.415
See if they have any more
vessels in this region.

23:13.492 --> 23:14.424
Yes, Captain.

23:14.493 --> 23:16.222
l've already begun
a spatial diag...

23:21.299 --> 23:26.635
My... My, my.
Look at the size of that thing.

23:26.705 --> 23:27.672
This viewscreen.

23:27.773 --> 23:30.207
lt's got to be one
of the biggest l've ever seen.

23:30.275 --> 23:32.743
l'll give you
20 bars of latinum for it.

23:32.844 --> 23:34.869
l think the inhibitor's
gone off-line.

23:34.946 --> 23:36.311
Would you come here, please?

23:36.381 --> 23:38.781
Be quiet. Can't you see
l'm in the middle of a deal?

23:40.452 --> 23:43.216
Name your price, Captain...?

23:43.288 --> 23:45.313
Janeway, and you are...?

23:45.390 --> 23:47.381
Daimon Torrot.

23:47.459 --> 23:48.721
You're Ferengi.

23:48.794 --> 23:49.886
Of course l'm Ferengi.

23:49.961 --> 23:53.260
ls that some kind of insult
about the size of my ears?

23:53.331 --> 23:54.423
No, not at all.

23:54.499 --> 23:56.660
l'd be happy to
negotiate with you,

23:56.768 --> 23:58.759
but, first, we have
to get you to Sick Bay.

23:58.870 --> 24:00.394
Sick Bay?
What for?

24:00.505 --> 24:02.530
Because... you're ill.

24:02.641 --> 24:04.768
l've never felt better.

24:04.843 --> 24:06.140
Doctor.

24:06.211 --> 24:08.236
l'm afraid you've contracted

24:08.313 --> 24:10.713
a nasty strain
of the Ankaran flu.

24:10.782 --> 24:14.218
We've been treating you
several days. Remember?

24:14.286 --> 24:15.878
No.

24:16.021 --> 24:18.285
Short-term memory loss--
it's one of the symptoms.

24:18.356 --> 24:19.983
Don't worry. lt isn't
life-threatening,

24:20.058 --> 24:21.889
but we'll need to treat you...
in Sick Bay.

24:22.027 --> 24:25.155
What is this treatment
going to cost me?

24:25.230 --> 24:26.822
lt's free of charge.

24:26.898 --> 24:27.887
Free?

24:28.033 --> 24:29.295
Yes.

24:29.401 --> 24:31.460
You know, l have been having
a nagging pain

24:31.570 --> 24:33.765
in my lower left lobe,
and while you're at it

24:33.872 --> 24:36.340
why don't you run a complete
tricardial diagnostic?

24:36.441 --> 24:37.908
The Ferengi Health Commission

24:38.009 --> 24:41.035
is trying to revoke
my trading license.

24:41.112 --> 24:43.410
lmpressive vessel,
Captain. Galaxy-class?

24:43.482 --> 24:44.744
lntrepid.

24:44.816 --> 24:45.942
Ah. Ah! And here we are

24:46.051 --> 24:47.882
in the much talked
about ''Sick Bay.''

24:47.953 --> 24:50.945
Not exactly state
of the medical art now, is it?

24:51.022 --> 24:52.148
What do you mean?

24:52.224 --> 24:53.282
Low on bio-beds,

24:53.358 --> 24:54.484
terrible lighting,

24:54.559 --> 24:56.493
obsolete instruments.

24:56.561 --> 24:58.825
Lucky for you, l know
a medical supplier

24:58.897 --> 25:01.422
that can spruce this place up
in a nanosecond

25:01.533 --> 25:04.798
and l'll even drop my commission
to a mere... 30 percent?

25:04.870 --> 25:06.098
How generous of you.

25:06.204 --> 25:07.831
Computer, activate force field.

25:07.939 --> 25:10.271
Force field?
You said l wasn't contagious.

25:10.342 --> 25:11.809
lt's for your own safety.

25:11.877 --> 25:13.811
l set the cortical
inhibitor to maximum...

25:13.879 --> 25:15.141
l've been kidnapped!

25:15.213 --> 25:16.703
but it is no longer
suppressing the effect.

25:16.781 --> 25:17.713
These personalities...

25:18.783 --> 25:20.114
are going to keep surfacing.

25:20.185 --> 25:22.676
All the more reason to shut down
the vinculum as soon as we can.

25:22.754 --> 25:24.654
Even if we do break the
link, it may be too late.

25:24.723 --> 25:26.384
Seven's own neural pattern
is destabilizing.

25:26.458 --> 25:27.447
lt could be lost.

25:27.526 --> 25:29.619
Please help me.

25:29.694 --> 25:30.854
l'm looking for my son--

25:30.929 --> 25:32.760
Gregory Bergan,
Lieutenant Bergan.

25:32.831 --> 25:33.820
Have you seen him?

25:33.899 --> 25:35.298
No, l'm afraid not.

25:35.367 --> 25:37.494
From the Starship Melbourne.

25:37.602 --> 25:38.830
Melbourne...

25:38.937 --> 25:42.429
l was supposed
to meet him at Wolf 359,

25:42.541 --> 25:44.532
but Starfleet sent out a warning

25:44.643 --> 25:46.838
that the Borg were
attacking that sector.

25:46.912 --> 25:49.142
lt was too late
for us to turn back.

25:49.214 --> 25:51.182
We were caught
in a terrible battle.

25:51.249 --> 25:52.910
My ship was badly damaged.

25:52.984 --> 25:54.952
We had to leave on escape pods.

25:55.086 --> 25:57.953
l never found out
what happened to Gregory.

25:58.023 --> 26:01.390
Please, l haven't heard from him
in over three days.

26:01.459 --> 26:05.190
Could you check
with Starfleet Headquarters?

26:05.263 --> 26:08.357
l'll see what l can do.

26:08.433 --> 26:10.492
Thank you, Captain.

26:10.602 --> 26:12.968
lf... if you do speak with him,

26:13.038 --> 26:15.700
could you tell him that
his mother is all right

26:15.807 --> 26:17.468
and if he could pos...?

26:21.246 --> 26:22.713
Captain...

26:22.781 --> 26:24.146
Seven?

26:25.183 --> 26:26.480
Yes.

26:26.551 --> 26:28.075
The vinculum...

26:28.153 --> 26:30.144
We're preparing
to shut it down right away.

26:30.221 --> 26:32.451
l'll give the order
as soon as Torres is ready.

26:33.558 --> 26:36.254
How long was l... absent?

26:36.328 --> 26:38.159
About 20 minutes.

26:38.229 --> 26:39.355
How many?

26:39.431 --> 26:40.693
Two.

26:40.765 --> 26:44.895
One of whom wanted to acquire
half the items on the ship.

26:45.070 --> 26:47.061
DaiMon Torrot, l believe.

26:48.173 --> 26:50.073
Species 180, Ferengi.

26:50.141 --> 26:52.439
Yes. The other was a woman

26:52.510 --> 26:55.775
whose son was lost
in a Borg attack.

26:55.847 --> 26:58.611
You'll get through this, Seven.

26:58.683 --> 27:01.243
l do not share your optimism.

27:04.155 --> 27:06.180
When you took me from the Borg

27:06.257 --> 27:08.987
and began to turn me
into an individual,

27:09.060 --> 27:11.426
l found the silence
of my own mind

27:11.496 --> 27:12.793
difficult to bear.

27:14.833 --> 27:17.825
l missed the voices
of the collective.

27:17.936 --> 27:23.806
But now that l am an individual
those same voices...

27:23.875 --> 27:25.172
frighten me.

27:27.946 --> 27:29.379
Captain, l don't know

27:29.447 --> 27:32.473
if l can tolerate
this condition much longer.

27:32.550 --> 27:36.350
My courage is insufficient.

27:38.556 --> 27:41.081
Your job is to keep trying...

27:41.159 --> 27:45.186
to hold on, even when
you think you can't.

27:45.263 --> 27:48.528
Leave the rest
to me and the crew.

28:02.147 --> 28:04.411
Meet anyone interesting?

28:04.482 --> 28:07.451
Just finished swapping jokes
with a Bolian manicurist.

28:07.519 --> 28:08.952
Before that, l was debating

28:09.020 --> 28:12.421
the finer points of temporal
physics with a Krenim scientist.

28:12.490 --> 28:14.424
12 new personalities
have surfaced

28:14.492 --> 28:15.857
in the past hour alone.

28:18.496 --> 28:20.225
Seven's having
a rough time of it.

28:20.298 --> 28:21.765
The Doctor had to sedate her.

28:21.833 --> 28:23.425
And how's
the Captain holding up?

28:23.535 --> 28:26.095
l've been better, Chakotay.

28:26.204 --> 28:28.764
ln fact...

28:28.873 --> 28:30.170
l'm starting to wonder

28:30.241 --> 28:32.607
if my first officer
was right all along.

28:32.677 --> 28:33.871
About what?

28:33.945 --> 28:37.312
You always said that
bringing Seven into the fold

28:37.382 --> 28:38.815
might be impossible.

28:38.883 --> 28:42.546
''You can take the Borg
out of the collective, but...''

28:43.621 --> 28:45.145
l don't believe that.

28:45.223 --> 28:46.815
Not anymore.

28:46.891 --> 28:50.622
l didn't think she'd last
a day, much less a year.

28:50.695 --> 28:52.993
l'd say you've proven me wrong.

28:53.064 --> 28:54.190
Torres to Bridge.

28:54.265 --> 28:56.631
We're ready to begin
disabling the vinculum.

28:56.735 --> 28:57.861
Proceed.

28:59.971 --> 29:01.802
Target the transneural matrix.

29:01.906 --> 29:04.397
Stand by to initiate
the dampening field

29:04.476 --> 29:05.738
on my mark.

29:05.810 --> 29:08.074
Three, two, one.

29:08.146 --> 29:10.307
Mark.

29:13.485 --> 29:15.385
lts power output is dropping.

29:17.889 --> 29:19.754
Doctor to Bridge.
lt seems to be working.

29:19.824 --> 29:21.382
Her neural pattern
is stabilizing.

29:24.162 --> 29:26.756
Power output
is down to 77 percent.

29:26.831 --> 29:29.095
7 1 percent...

29:29.200 --> 29:30.428
Wait a second.

29:30.535 --> 29:32.469
lt's increasing.

29:32.537 --> 29:34.630
l am refocusing the
dampening field.

29:34.739 --> 29:36.764
lt's still increasing.

29:36.875 --> 29:40.402
The vinculum is rerouting
its internal circuitry.

29:40.478 --> 29:41.638
lt's adapting.

29:42.714 --> 29:43.646
puH-chaH me'roQ!

29:44.716 --> 29:45.648
Engineering!

29:45.717 --> 29:46.706
Mother!

29:46.785 --> 29:48.685
Her synaptic pathways
are destabilizing!

29:48.753 --> 29:50.220
Abort the procedure!

29:50.288 --> 29:51.220
...voices. Help me!

29:51.289 --> 29:52.415
Abort!

29:52.490 --> 29:54.014
Stand by, Doctor.

29:54.092 --> 29:55.753
Power output at 98 percent.

29:56.828 --> 29:58.193
The force field is collapsing.

29:58.263 --> 29:59.890
Transfer to emergency power.

30:00.031 --> 30:01.498
lt won't work, Lieutenant.

30:01.566 --> 30:02.498
We must abort.

30:02.567 --> 30:03.625
Tuvok to Bridge.

30:03.735 --> 30:05.760
The procedure was unsuccessful.

30:05.870 --> 30:08.304
The vinculum has returned
to full power.

30:08.373 --> 30:09.431
Acknowledged.

30:09.541 --> 30:10.803
Doctor, report.

30:10.875 --> 30:13.901
Seven's neural pattern
has disappeared, Captain.

30:13.978 --> 30:15.946
lt appears that...

30:16.047 --> 30:18.777
the other patterns
have taken over completely.

30:18.850 --> 30:20.044
We've lost her.

30:28.259 --> 30:30.284
Captain's Log, supplemental.

30:30.361 --> 30:32.522
Long-range sensors
have detected a vessel

30:32.597 --> 30:35.532
belonging to Species 6339.

30:35.600 --> 30:37.659
We've set a course
to intercept them

30:37.769 --> 30:40.966
in the hopes they can help us
restore Seven of Nine.

30:41.072 --> 30:43.597
l've managed to stabilize
her primary cortical functions,

30:43.708 --> 30:47.109
but the woman in Sick Bay is not
Seven of Nine-- not anymore.

30:47.178 --> 30:49.976
New personalities are emerging
every few seconds now.

30:50.048 --> 30:51.015
She can't finish a sentence

30:51.082 --> 30:52.379
before the next one
rears its head.

30:52.450 --> 30:55.613
lt's creating an incredible
strain on her cerebral cortex.

30:55.687 --> 30:57.211
lf we don't deactivate
the vinculum soon,

30:57.288 --> 30:58.277
we may never get her back.

30:58.356 --> 30:59.288
Tuvok?

30:59.357 --> 31:01.222
Lieutenant Torres
is taking measures

31:01.326 --> 31:03.260
to prevent the vinculum
from adapting,

31:03.294 --> 31:05.262
but there's no guarantee
she'll succeed.

31:05.330 --> 31:07.389
Captain, l've exhausted every
viable treatment in my database.

31:07.465 --> 31:10.491
Then logic dictates
we go beyond medical science.

31:10.602 --> 31:13.070
l will attempt to mind-meld
with Seven of Nine.

31:13.171 --> 31:15.799
A mind-meld? You consider that
a viable treatment?

31:15.907 --> 31:18.034
Seven's neural pattern--
her sense of self--

31:18.109 --> 31:19.406
is immersed in chaos.

31:19.477 --> 31:21.468
l will attempt
to isolate her true self

31:21.546 --> 31:23.241
and guide it to the surface.

31:23.314 --> 31:24.941
lt's dangerous enough
to meld with one person,

31:25.016 --> 31:27.041
let alone hundreds
of different personalities.

31:27.118 --> 31:28.050
lt's too risky.

31:28.119 --> 31:29.381
The risk is mine to take.

31:29.454 --> 31:31.615
l'm aware of that,
but is this our only option?

31:31.689 --> 31:33.623
l believe it is, Captain.

31:33.691 --> 31:35.124
How long would you need
to prepare?

31:35.193 --> 31:36.319
Captain...

31:36.394 --> 31:37.884
you can't actually be
considering this...

31:37.962 --> 31:39.589
Vulcan mumbo jumbo.

31:39.664 --> 31:41.529
l will require
two hours of meditation.

31:41.599 --> 31:42.964
Begin immediately.

31:43.101 --> 31:44.728
Report to Sick Bay
when you're ready.

31:44.836 --> 31:46.303
You said it yourself.

31:46.404 --> 31:48.304
We've exhausted
every medical treatment.

31:48.373 --> 31:50.466
l just hope l don't find
myself with a second patient.

31:50.575 --> 31:52.008
Captain to the Bridge.

31:52.076 --> 31:53.043
On my way.

31:55.013 --> 31:55.945
Commander?

31:56.014 --> 31:58.209
lt's them-- Species 6339.

31:58.283 --> 31:59.511
Their vessel is well-armed,
Captain.

31:59.584 --> 32:02.348
l'm picking up 22 phaser cannons
on the aft section alone.

32:02.453 --> 32:03.511
Hail them.

32:03.554 --> 32:04.782
They're responding.

32:04.856 --> 32:06.323
On screen.

32:06.391 --> 32:08.757
l'm Captain Janeway

32:08.826 --> 32:11.294
of the Federation
Starship Voyager.

32:11.362 --> 32:14.525
We recently found a piece
of Borg technology.

32:14.599 --> 32:16.794
lt's been infected
with a viral agent

32:16.901 --> 32:18.198
we believe was
transmitted by your...

32:18.303 --> 32:20.271
The vinculum.
You have it?

32:21.339 --> 32:22.397
Yes.

32:22.507 --> 32:26.034
You've made
a terrible mistake, Captain.

32:26.110 --> 32:27.077
A weapon?

32:27.178 --> 32:29.043
Yes. Since the Borg
decimated our world,

32:29.113 --> 32:31.581
we've been looking
for ways to retaliate.

32:31.649 --> 32:34.675
So you created a virus
to infect their technology.

32:34.752 --> 32:37.186
13 of my people were
injected with the virus.

32:37.255 --> 32:39.416
They allowed themselves
to be assimilated

32:39.490 --> 32:41.958
so that the virus would spread
to this vinculum.

32:42.093 --> 32:44.118
Once another Borg ship
had retrieved it,

32:44.195 --> 32:45.856
they would be infected as well.

32:45.930 --> 32:47.898
Then another cube,
and another...

32:47.966 --> 32:49.126
We had the opportunity

32:49.200 --> 32:51.691
to infect dozens, even
hundreds of Borg vessels

32:51.803 --> 32:53.270
until you interfered!

32:53.371 --> 32:54.599
Why?

32:54.706 --> 32:57.732
Your virus has had one
unexpected casualty...

32:57.842 --> 32:59.366
a member of my crew.

32:59.477 --> 33:01.775
lt wasn't designed
to infect other species.

33:01.879 --> 33:03.039
She's Borg.

33:03.081 --> 33:04.605
We liberated her

33:04.682 --> 33:06.513
from the collective
over a year ago.

33:06.584 --> 33:07.812
She's an individual now.

33:07.885 --> 33:10.115
We were hoping you could
help us treat her.

33:10.188 --> 33:14.648
We designed that virus
to destroy Borg, Captain.

33:14.726 --> 33:17.217
We never considered a treatment.

33:17.295 --> 33:20.890
l'm afraid your drone
won't survive,

33:20.999 --> 33:24.594
but we must return the vinculum
to the debris field immediately.

33:24.702 --> 33:27.671
lf the Borg arrive first,
we'll have lost our chance.

33:27.772 --> 33:31.037
And those 13 people
will have died in vain.

33:32.410 --> 33:34.469
All right.
We'll return it to you,

33:34.545 --> 33:37.571
but first we need to try
to save our crew member.

33:37.648 --> 33:38.808
We think we have a way

33:38.883 --> 33:40.817
to counteract
the vinculum's effects.

33:40.885 --> 33:41.817
B'Elanna?

33:41.886 --> 33:43.410
l'm going to try to remodulate

33:43.488 --> 33:45.353
our dampening field
to compensate...

33:45.423 --> 33:46.856
We don't have time for this.

33:46.924 --> 33:49.358
The vinculum, Captain.

33:49.427 --> 33:51.486
l can't give it to you.

33:51.562 --> 33:52.688
Not yet.

33:52.764 --> 33:54.561
You've scanned our vessel.

33:54.632 --> 33:57.294
You're aware of our firepower.

33:57.402 --> 34:01.668
You could undoubtedly do
significant damage to Voyager

34:01.739 --> 34:03.468
and to the vinculum.

34:03.541 --> 34:05.475
ls that what you want?

34:06.811 --> 34:11.510
The vinculum survived
the destruction of one ship.

34:11.581 --> 34:15.313
What makes you so sure
it won't survive another?

34:26.664 --> 34:27.858
Doctor...

34:27.931 --> 34:28.899
Seven.

34:30.635 --> 34:32.603
A necessary precaution.

34:32.670 --> 34:36.106
A few of your... guests
have been violent.

34:36.206 --> 34:37.400
The vinculum.

34:37.475 --> 34:38.635
lt keeps adapting.

34:38.708 --> 34:41.143
We haven't been able
to shut it down.

34:41.212 --> 34:44.909
Your own neural pattern was
nearly destroyed in the process.

34:44.982 --> 34:47.951
l wasn't sure
l'd find you again.

34:48.052 --> 34:49.849
l am damaged.

34:49.920 --> 34:52.355
One of your... personas

34:52.422 --> 34:54.618
didn't appreciate
the restraints.

34:54.692 --> 34:57.957
She seemed intent on forcing
her way to freedom.

34:58.062 --> 34:59.222
l apologize.

35:00.431 --> 35:02.262
lt was hardly your fault.
You're ill.

35:02.333 --> 35:03.595
lrrelevant.

35:03.668 --> 35:05.966
l am Borg--
l should be able to adapt.

35:06.070 --> 35:07.867
Surprise--
you aren't invincible.

35:07.972 --> 35:10.600
l suppose that's something
we'll have to tackle

35:10.708 --> 35:12.175
in our next social lesson.

35:17.949 --> 35:19.211
Voices?

35:19.283 --> 35:21.342
They're getting louder.

35:22.753 --> 35:24.880
lt won't be long
before l lose you again.

35:26.624 --> 35:28.216
lt's my duty as your physician

35:28.292 --> 35:30.624
to inform you
of an alternative treatment.

35:30.695 --> 35:31.753
What treatment?

35:31.829 --> 35:33.990
Commander Tuvok has
proposed a mind-meld

35:34.065 --> 35:36.431
to help stabilize
your neural pattern.

35:36.534 --> 35:37.899
l had a similar reaction.

35:38.035 --> 35:39.434
lf you don't approve...

35:39.504 --> 35:41.096
What is the probability
of success?

35:41.205 --> 35:42.638
l don't know.

35:42.707 --> 35:44.937
A mind-meld is hardly a
standard medical practice.

35:45.009 --> 35:47.204
Are there any risks to Tuvok?

35:47.278 --> 35:48.836
He could suffer brain damage,

35:48.913 --> 35:51.677
but he's confident he'll
be able to break the meld

35:51.749 --> 35:53.649
before that happens.

35:53.718 --> 35:55.913
Even if we do
shut down the vinculum,

35:55.987 --> 35:57.955
it may not be enough.

35:58.089 --> 36:00.489
lf Tuvok can do
anything to help me...

36:00.591 --> 36:01.888
l understand.

36:02.960 --> 36:04.757
Doctor...

36:04.829 --> 36:08.162
you have shown
a great deal of patience.

36:08.232 --> 36:09.927
Not at all.

36:10.034 --> 36:14.596
lnform the crew that l am
also grateful for their efforts.

36:14.705 --> 36:17.367
You'll be able
to tell them yourself afterward.

36:18.976 --> 36:19.874
Seven!

36:19.977 --> 36:21.069
Voices!

36:21.145 --> 36:22.407
Concentrate.

36:23.948 --> 36:25.882
Focus on the sound of my voice.

36:25.950 --> 36:27.747
Get them out, please!

36:28.986 --> 36:30.010
l can't...

36:31.556 --> 36:32.818
l can't...

36:32.890 --> 36:35.518
No! No!

36:54.345 --> 36:55.403
Report.

36:55.479 --> 36:57.413
The alien vessel
is coming about.

36:57.481 --> 36:58.948
They're charging weapons.

36:59.016 --> 37:00.540
Shields.

37:05.456 --> 37:07.481
As if the meld weren't
dangerous enough,

37:07.558 --> 37:10.322
the aliens are trying
to take the vinculum by force.

37:10.394 --> 37:12.157
Commander Chakotay
is at tactical.

37:12.230 --> 37:13.925
The Captain wants
you here with Seven.

37:13.998 --> 37:16.432
This will allow me
to monitor your neural activity

37:16.500 --> 37:17.967
for the duration of the meld.

37:18.035 --> 37:19.502
At the first sign of trouble...

37:19.570 --> 37:20.628
You will do nothing.

37:20.738 --> 37:21.966
l beg your pardon?

37:22.073 --> 37:24.405
There will undoubtedly be
many signs of trouble.

37:24.475 --> 37:26.875
You must have faith
in my ability to endure them.

37:26.978 --> 37:28.536
l'll try.
l just hope my faith

37:28.613 --> 37:30.877
doesn't leave the two of you
brain-damaged.

37:30.948 --> 37:32.882
Your concerns
have been noted, Doctor.

37:33.017 --> 37:35.508
With all of these new
personalities floating around,

37:35.586 --> 37:37.486
it's a shame
we can't find one for you.

37:37.555 --> 37:39.819
Computer, deactivate
force field.

37:43.628 --> 37:45.562
Why am l tied to this bed?

37:45.630 --> 37:48.155
Please let me go.

37:48.232 --> 37:50.666
pahtk!

37:50.768 --> 37:52.827
l'll rip out your throat,
coward!

37:55.339 --> 37:56.499
Name your price.

37:56.607 --> 37:57.938
Ten bars of latinum?

37:58.075 --> 37:59.599
Twenty?

37:59.710 --> 38:02.144
This isn't medicine.
lt's torture!

38:02.246 --> 38:04.111
l'll sue for malpractice!

38:05.750 --> 38:09.277
l fail to see the logic
in this meld, Commander.

38:09.353 --> 38:10.752
My mind to your mind.

38:10.821 --> 38:12.448
You are but one mind
confronting thousands.

38:12.523 --> 38:14.252
My thoughts to your thoughts.

38:14.325 --> 38:16.316
You will not succeed.

38:16.394 --> 38:17.827
Your mind to my mind.

38:17.928 --> 38:19.122
Let me go.

38:19.196 --> 38:20.128
My mind to your mind.

38:20.197 --> 38:21.289
The Borg are
assimilating the ship!

38:21.365 --> 38:22.297
We've got to evacuate.

38:22.366 --> 38:23.298
My thoughts
to your thoughts.

38:23.401 --> 38:24.663
-Listen to me!!
-My mind to your mind.

38:24.769 --> 38:25.963
They're trying
to assimilate the ship!

38:26.070 --> 38:27.002
Let me go!

38:27.071 --> 38:29.039
My thoughts to your thoughts.

38:29.140 --> 38:31.108
Where's my mommy? Mommy!

38:31.208 --> 38:33.642
My mind to your mind.

38:33.711 --> 38:34.678
Mommy...

38:34.745 --> 38:39.375
My thoughts to your thoughts.

38:44.255 --> 38:45.620
Seven?

38:50.695 --> 38:52.424
Seven!

38:58.169 --> 38:59.193
Seven!

39:06.944 --> 39:08.844
Seven!

39:12.917 --> 39:14.111
Seven!

39:22.660 --> 39:24.025
Seven!

39:25.863 --> 39:26.852
Seven!

39:34.271 --> 39:36.136
l'm lost! Somebody help me!

39:36.207 --> 39:38.198
Please! l don't like it here!

39:38.309 --> 39:39.571
l want to go home!

39:39.643 --> 39:40.610
l can't find my...

39:40.711 --> 39:42.838
Mommy! Please! Help me!

39:42.913 --> 39:45.245
Please! l don't
want to stay here!

39:45.316 --> 39:46.977
l want to go home!
l don't like it!

39:47.051 --> 39:49.417
Please help me!
l want to go home!

39:49.487 --> 39:52.854
These people are scary!
Please don't go!

39:52.923 --> 39:54.754
Please! Why are you
leaving me here?!

39:54.825 --> 39:56.383
Don't go!

39:56.460 --> 39:58.928
Please! l don't like it here!

40:02.600 --> 40:03.726
Sick Bay to Engineering.

40:03.801 --> 40:05.769
How long until the vinculum's
off-line?

40:05.836 --> 40:08.430
Two, maybe three minutes...

40:08.539 --> 40:11.770
provided Voyager can stay
in one piece for that long.

40:15.813 --> 40:17.644
Shields down to 60 percent.

40:17.715 --> 40:18.841
Evasive maneuvers.

40:18.916 --> 40:20.850
Target their
weapons array.

40:20.918 --> 40:23.113
Targeting systems
are malfunctioning.

40:23.187 --> 40:25.883
We're losing power
to main thrusters.

40:25.956 --> 40:27.082
Shields to 35 percent.

40:27.158 --> 40:29.217
Reroute all available
power to shields.

40:29.293 --> 40:31.227
Chakotay, initiate
manual targeting.

40:31.295 --> 40:32.762
Torres to Bridge.

40:32.830 --> 40:34.491
The vinculum's stopped adapting.

40:34.565 --> 40:36.760
l think the new dampening field
is working.

40:36.834 --> 40:39.462
We should have it disabled
in the next 60 seconds.

40:39.570 --> 40:42.562
Warning. Neurochemical synapses
are destabilizing.

40:42.673 --> 40:44.641
Computer, increase power
to the cortical inhibitors.

40:44.708 --> 40:47.768
Unable to comply. Power
transport systems are off-line.

40:47.845 --> 40:50.279
Tuvok, if you can hear me,
we have to terminate the meld.

40:50.347 --> 40:52.212
Tuvok! Tuvok!

40:53.417 --> 40:55.385
le'raH tuH me'roQ.

41:09.667 --> 41:11.157
Commander?

41:13.103 --> 41:14.468
Commander?

41:22.446 --> 41:23.470
Seven!

41:23.547 --> 41:25.105
Commander?

41:30.254 --> 41:31.721
Seven!

41:31.789 --> 41:34.883
Power output's down
to 29 percent.

41:34.959 --> 41:37.052
22... 17...

41:41.131 --> 41:43.122
Bridge, we just lost
the field emitters.

41:43.200 --> 41:45.464
We took a direct hit
to the power grid.

41:45.569 --> 41:48.367
Stand by. We're switching
to emergency backup.

41:58.349 --> 41:59.509
Seven!

42:04.221 --> 42:06.416
Bridge, the vinculum's
powering up again.

42:06.490 --> 42:08.890
The field emitters
are back on line.

42:08.993 --> 42:09.960
Pull the plug.

42:13.163 --> 42:14.494
lt's working.

42:14.565 --> 42:18.023
Power output down to 19 percent.

42:18.135 --> 42:19.898
13 percent.

42:22.106 --> 42:23.698
Seven!

42:26.610 --> 42:28.077
Seven!

42:28.178 --> 42:30.373
Tuvok!

42:30.447 --> 42:31.846
Seven!

42:33.417 --> 42:35.078
lt's done, Captain.

42:35.152 --> 42:36.779
The vinculum's off-line.

42:52.269 --> 42:54.328
Seven?

42:54.438 --> 42:56.303
Yes.

42:56.373 --> 42:57.863
We have her back, Captain.

42:57.975 --> 42:58.964
Hail the lead vessel.

42:59.143 --> 43:00.906
Tell them we're surrendering
the vinculum.

43:02.713 --> 43:04.681
No response.

43:04.748 --> 43:06.409
Lock onto the damn thing.

43:06.483 --> 43:07.780
Beam it into space.

43:10.487 --> 43:12.580
Transport complete.

43:14.224 --> 43:16.249
They're withdrawing.

43:16.327 --> 43:18.727
Take us out of here, Tom.
Warp 9.

43:18.796 --> 43:19.990
Yes, ma'am.

43:22.633 --> 43:26.592
Captain's Log, Stardate 52356.2.

43:26.704 --> 43:29.138
After nearly a week
of regeneration,

43:29.206 --> 43:32.698
Seven of Nine has finally
recovered from her ordeal.

43:34.912 --> 43:38.905
Neuroprocessor, cortical
receptors, all stable.

43:38.983 --> 43:40.473
She's fit to return to duty.

43:40.551 --> 43:42.314
What about her
other personalities?

43:42.386 --> 43:43.410
Any sign of them?

43:43.487 --> 43:44.579
Those neural patterns

43:44.655 --> 43:46.646
have returned
to their dormant state.

43:46.724 --> 43:49.090
The voices will not return?

43:50.394 --> 43:52.760
l suppose that depends
on your perspective.

43:52.830 --> 43:53.956
You may not hear them,

43:54.064 --> 43:56.362
but l suspect
they'll always be with you.

43:59.937 --> 44:04.431
The members of this crew put
themselves at risk to help me.

44:04.541 --> 44:07.442
l am unsure how to reciprocate.

44:07.511 --> 44:09.376
Let's start
with something small.

44:09.446 --> 44:12.040
Like a recalibration
of the EPS manifolds?

44:12.116 --> 44:14.414
B'Elanna's expecting
you in Engineering.

44:14.485 --> 44:16.680
l will join her shortly.

44:16.754 --> 44:20.451
There is a crew member
l must see first.

44:24.662 --> 44:26.220
These are star charts for
the next three systems

44:26.296 --> 44:27.456
Voyager will pass through.

44:27.531 --> 44:28.725
Familiarize yourself with them.

44:28.799 --> 44:29.891
Understood.

44:30.034 --> 44:33.026
Sociological data regarding
173 Delta Quadrant species.

44:33.137 --> 44:34.069
Study it.

44:34.138 --> 44:35.332
l will.

44:35.439 --> 44:36.371
As Bridge Assistant,

44:36.440 --> 44:37.839
you will find
this information relevant.

44:37.908 --> 44:39.899
Consider it ''assimilated.''

44:40.010 --> 44:41.875
There is one more assignment.

44:41.945 --> 44:44.539
l require your assistance.

44:44.615 --> 44:46.242
Me?

44:46.316 --> 44:50.343
l wish to participate
in recreational activities.

44:50.421 --> 44:51.888
Great.

44:53.590 --> 44:55.148
Kadis-Kot.

44:55.225 --> 44:57.819
lnstruct me how to play.

44:57.895 --> 44:59.795
l will comply.
