00:01.776 --> 00:02.976
- this is not hank's fault?
excuse me.

00:02.994 --> 00:04.995
What does that mean?
- it's not my fault.

00:05.029 --> 00:06.663
- you didn't tell her.

00:07.198 --> 00:08.498
- tell me what?

00:08.532 --> 00:10.750
- becca's father and i
had a slight indiscretion.

00:10.785 --> 00:12.168
- she's got to be
kidding me, right?

00:12.203 --> 00:15.338
I don't want to hear about
felicia and her mid-life crisis.

00:15.373 --> 00:17.290
- fuck me, bone me,
stuff me.

00:17.324 --> 00:18.708
Take your pick.
- oh.

00:18.759 --> 00:21.428
- wait, who else
has he been fucking?

00:21.462 --> 00:24.047
You?
oh, gross.

00:24.098 --> 00:26.383
- can't believe
you slept with all of them.

00:26.434 --> 00:27.767
- you're a goddamn
girl-whisperer.

00:27.802 --> 00:28.835
- okay.

00:28.853 --> 00:30.637
- julian's a writer too.
- really.

00:30.671 --> 00:32.005
<i>- he wrote
the artist within.</i>

00:32.023 --> 00:33.440
Fucking genius.

00:33.474 --> 00:35.008
- why are you asking me
to procure you drugs

00:35.026 --> 00:36.526
Like i'm your assistant?

00:36.560 --> 00:38.895
- i'm dating my dream crush.

00:38.946 --> 00:40.981
Hitting my peak sexually.

00:41.015 --> 00:43.149
- just give me my blow,
and let's just call it a day.

00:43.183 --> 00:45.201
- no fucking way,
rick springfield.

00:45.236 --> 00:47.370
- you just don't want me
to be happy, charlie.

00:47.405 --> 00:49.873
ha ha ha.

00:49.907 --> 00:51.074
Shit.

00:51.125 --> 00:52.659
You're going to get
your ass fired?

00:52.693 --> 00:54.327
- if i fire you first.
- charlie.

00:54.361 --> 00:58.197
You want to go back to
slinging beamers in the valley?

00:58.215 --> 00:59.866
- all right,
maybe i got carried away.

of that wine,

But i don't like--
- hey.

01:38.372 --> 01:39.872
- hey.

01:42.009 --> 01:43.676

- oh.

01:43.710 --> 01:44.677
Great, i could eat.

01:44.711 --> 01:45.895
You just
give me a second?

01:45.929 --> 01:48.481
I want to change my shirt.
these pits are barking.

01:48.515 --> 01:50.099
No, actually,
that's pretty good.

01:50.150 --> 01:51.150
Salty.

01:51.185 --> 01:52.385
Yeah, you girls
want some of this?

01:52.403 --> 01:54.270
Check it out?
keeps you regular.

01:54.321 --> 01:56.389
All right,
what are we thinking?

01:56.407 --> 01:58.941
- we're thinking that you
weren't exactly invited.

01:58.992 --> 02:00.243
- oh.

02:00.277 --> 02:02.195
that shit is cold.

02:02.229 --> 02:04.364
- yeah, you know
marcy's in a funk

02:04.398 --> 02:06.282
About the whole
rick springfield of it all.

02:06.333 --> 02:07.566
So--
- hey, chels.

02:07.584 --> 02:09.285
- we were going to, you know,
take her out,

02:09.336 --> 02:10.586
Show her a good time.

02:10.621 --> 02:12.872
Lady stuff.
- i like the lady stuff.

02:12.906 --> 02:13.923
- i know you do.

02:13.957 --> 02:15.675
- i was kind of
looking forward to this

02:15.709 --> 02:18.628
As a little
family togetherness time.

02:18.679 --> 02:21.347
- oh, well,
maybe next time.

02:21.382 --> 02:24.600
- 'cause i thought
it might be good foreplay.

02:24.635 --> 02:27.753
- oh, um, family togetherness
equals foreplay how exactly?

02:27.771 --> 02:28.805
- well, it's been
quite some time

02:28.856 --> 02:30.089
Since we've lain together--

02:30.107 --> 02:31.757
- yeah. yeah.
- as man and woman.

02:31.775 --> 02:33.693
- and it's going to be--it's
going to be some time, hank.

02:33.727 --> 02:34.760
- really? can you--
- mm-hmm.

02:34.778 --> 02:37.780
- how many...
days, weeks, months?

02:37.815 --> 02:41.951
- well, when i close my eyes,
and i don't see you inside

02:41.985 --> 02:43.936
That annoying little simp
of a woman.

02:43.954 --> 02:45.104
- oh, that's gross.

02:45.122 --> 02:47.039
- then--then maybe
i'll be good to go.

02:47.074 --> 02:48.291
- why, why--
- i mean, roughly speaking.

02:48.325 --> 02:49.492
- why you got to
be like that?

02:49.543 --> 02:51.110
- was it good, hank?
the sex?

02:51.128 --> 02:53.612
- ah, come on.
- did she rock your world?

02:53.630 --> 02:54.831
Did she fuck
your brains out?

02:54.882 --> 02:57.800
- oh, stop, i was
performing a service, karen.

02:57.835 --> 02:59.168
When a plumber
works on pipes,

02:59.219 --> 03:01.120
He doesn't think about
the quality of the pipes.

03:01.138 --> 03:02.788
He just fixes
the shit out of them,

03:02.806 --> 03:04.307
And then he goes
the fuck home.

03:04.341 --> 03:06.225
And drinks to forget.

03:06.260 --> 03:08.511
All right, well,
you guys have a lovely evening.

03:08.562 --> 03:09.846
Say hi to the marce
for me.

03:09.897 --> 03:11.264
Tell her
to keep her chin up.

03:11.298 --> 03:13.316
I'll be fine here alone.

03:13.350 --> 03:16.686
Eating a pb&j
under a bare bulb.

03:19.740 --> 03:27.663

to major dong.

04:11.024 --> 04:13.359
- not a good time, hank.

04:13.377 --> 04:15.328
- i'm getting a serious
relocation vibe, here.

04:15.362 --> 04:17.046
You moving
north of wilshire?

04:17.079 --> 04:18.748
- i got the ax, hank.

04:18.798 --> 04:20.166
Shit-canned.

04:20.200 --> 04:23.586
Charlie runkle is once again
an agent without an agency.

04:23.637 --> 04:25.221
- rick springfield ankled?

04:25.255 --> 04:26.589
- that's right.

04:26.640 --> 04:30.226
That he-man, woman-hating
salad-tosser is now in play.

04:30.260 --> 04:31.561
- buck up, chuck.
you've still got me.

04:31.595 --> 04:33.763
I'm bound to put pen to paper
one of these days.

04:33.814 --> 04:34.764
Hey, fuck you.

04:34.815 --> 04:36.882
- whoo-hoo.
- all right, runkle.

04:36.900 --> 04:38.384
Here are the rest of them.

04:38.402 --> 04:40.436
I trust you will be discreet,

04:40.487 --> 04:43.155
Especially with the ones
with my legs akimbo.

04:43.190 --> 04:44.557
- sure thing, sue.

04:44.575 --> 04:46.725
- ah, the writer
who doesn't write.

04:46.743 --> 04:49.328
I take it you're off
with jerry maguire, here.

04:49.363 --> 04:50.329
- oh, undoubtedly.

04:50.364 --> 04:52.064
Homies before hos,
you know?

04:52.082 --> 04:55.451
- ah, good.
well, it saved me a phone call.

04:55.502 --> 04:56.752
There's no heat on you.

04:56.787 --> 04:59.288
I mean, you're as cold
as a witch's cunny.

04:59.339 --> 05:00.673
- ouchie-wahwah.

05:00.707 --> 05:02.542
The lady's really got it
in for me this evening.

05:02.576 --> 05:03.960
- hey, hey, hey.
it's just business.

05:04.011 --> 05:05.044
- oh, yeah.
- you understand.

05:05.078 --> 05:06.045
- i get it.
- nothing personal.

05:06.079 --> 05:07.547
- nope.

05:07.581 --> 05:08.881
- now, runkle.

05:08.915 --> 05:10.266
Just because
we no longer have

05:10.300 --> 05:11.551
A professional
relationship

05:11.585 --> 05:15.754
Does not mean that you
cannot wine me, dine me,

05:15.772 --> 05:19.725
And stand-up 69 me
once in a while, huh?

05:19.759 --> 05:21.110
- dear god.

05:21.144 --> 05:22.361
- well, she's got a point.

05:22.396 --> 05:23.779
There's no reason
you should let

05:23.814 --> 05:25.931
A professional misstep
come between you

05:25.949 --> 05:27.450
And a quality 69.

05:27.484 --> 05:28.951
- so you fire me,

05:28.986 --> 05:31.954
But you still want me around
as some sort of boy toy?

05:31.989 --> 05:33.873
- how's sundays for you?

05:33.907 --> 05:36.993
- charlie runkle
is not a doormat.

05:37.044 --> 05:39.795
He's not some little puppy
that comes trotting back

05:39.830 --> 05:41.547
After being kicked
to the curb.

05:41.582 --> 05:42.548
- you go, girl.

05:42.583 --> 05:44.300
- suit yourself, stallion.

05:44.334 --> 05:46.502
You know,
we could have been

05:46.553 --> 05:49.005
Lifelong fuck buddies,
runkle.

05:49.056 --> 05:51.140
Leave your keys
with rhonda.

05:51.174 --> 05:55.094
Collini, out.

05:55.128 --> 05:57.063
- she's a sweet woman.

05:57.097 --> 05:58.981
Salt of the earth, really.
i'm going to miss her.

05:59.016 --> 06:00.799
- really?
- not really.

06:00.817 --> 06:01.967
Want to get
some gin and juice?

06:01.985 --> 06:04.470
- ooh, hoochie-mama.

06:04.488 --> 06:06.272
Think i'm going to
take me one of these.

06:06.306 --> 06:08.240
- bad boy.

06:11.278 --> 06:15.081
? ?

06:15.115 --> 06:16.666
- two hamsters
in a fucking cage,

06:16.700 --> 06:18.317
Going round and round.

06:18.335 --> 06:20.002
When will we ever learn?

06:20.037 --> 06:22.838
- hey, i'm still working off
last year's sins.

06:22.873 --> 06:24.323
You're the one with
fresh blood on your hands.

06:24.341 --> 06:25.625
- no, i didn't commit
any crimes, though.

06:25.659 --> 06:26.876
That's the thing.

06:26.927 --> 06:28.160
Karen was
clear across the country.

06:28.178 --> 06:29.161
I thought
we had an understanding.

06:29.179 --> 06:30.663
We did.
- oh.

06:30.681 --> 06:31.881
- she did some things.

06:31.932 --> 06:34.684
Ugh.
clearly i did some things.

06:34.718 --> 06:37.687
But we're being very adult
and european about it.

06:37.721 --> 06:41.107
- no matter what they say,
bitches don't like it

06:41.141 --> 06:42.642
When you fuck
other bitches.

06:42.676 --> 06:44.143
- word.

06:44.177 --> 06:46.362
And they don't like it when
you call them bitches, either.

06:46.396 --> 06:48.981
- oh.
- fyi for you, charlie runkle.

06:49.015 --> 06:50.849
- so you think
we'll ever get it right?

06:50.867 --> 06:52.451
- mm.

06:52.486 --> 06:54.036
That remains to be seen.

06:54.071 --> 06:55.321
I think that ultimately

06:55.355 --> 06:56.739
They're going to
have to raise the white flag

06:56.790 --> 06:58.691
And just accept us
for the emotional retards

06:58.709 --> 06:59.692
That we are,
don't you think?

06:59.710 --> 07:01.627
- one would think.
- yeah.

07:01.662 --> 07:02.962
- just hope my wiener
still works.

07:02.996 --> 07:04.080
- mm.

07:04.131 --> 07:05.414
You'll be punishing
that thing

07:05.465 --> 07:07.083
With gnarled,
arthritic hands.

07:07.134 --> 07:09.168
Don't you worry.

07:09.202 --> 07:10.386
- i still love her, though.

07:10.420 --> 07:11.470
- yeah.
- you know?

07:11.505 --> 07:13.556
My sweet little piece
of marcipan.

07:13.590 --> 07:15.341
- yeah.
- those boobies?

07:15.375 --> 07:17.143
- mm.
- her teeny, tiny bajinie.

07:17.177 --> 07:18.210
- that's enough.

07:18.228 --> 07:19.595
- yeah, after
all these years,

07:19.646 --> 07:21.397
She still gets this white man
harder than igneous rock.

07:21.431 --> 07:22.548
- settle down,
white man.

07:22.566 --> 07:23.766
Take it
to the restroom.

07:23.817 --> 07:25.551
- don't you have
those moments sometimes?

07:25.569 --> 07:29.271
You know, when you just--
you think to yourself, god--

07:29.322 --> 07:32.608
I love this woman,
and i always will.

07:32.659 --> 07:34.443
- there was this one time--

07:34.494 --> 07:36.996
I fell asleep in the porsche
outside of bill's house.

07:37.030 --> 07:39.699
- just once?
- becca found me.

07:39.733 --> 07:42.251
It was, like,
two or three years ago, i think.

07:42.285 --> 07:43.869
And karen invited me in
and made me breakfast.

07:43.903 --> 07:45.171
Now, i know that becca,

07:45.205 --> 07:47.256
I'm sure, strong-armed her
into inviting me in.

07:47.290 --> 07:48.507
But,
that's not the point.

07:48.542 --> 07:51.043
She made me breakfast,
and she didn't have to.

07:51.077 --> 07:53.713
You know, she made me
this omelet that was delicious.

07:53.747 --> 07:54.880
Perfect breakfast.

07:54.914 --> 07:56.415
You know why?
because she made it for me.

07:56.433 --> 07:57.717
- mm.

07:57.751 --> 07:59.101
- and then she told me
to grow the fuck up

07:59.136 --> 08:00.102
And get on with my life.

08:00.137 --> 08:01.303
But that didn't matter.

08:01.354 --> 08:03.422
Because it was
one of those moments

08:03.440 --> 08:05.608
Where i decided--
i resolved--

08:05.642 --> 08:07.860
That i was
going to keep on fighting.

08:07.894 --> 08:10.229
You know, i've--
i've lost many battles,

08:10.263 --> 08:13.199
But i've never lost sight
of the war.

08:13.233 --> 08:14.533
No retreat, baby.

08:14.568 --> 08:18.037
No surrender.

08:18.071 --> 08:20.489
Jesus christ, runkle,
are you weeping again?

08:20.540 --> 08:22.491
- well, it was sweet.
you--you moved me.

08:23.543 --> 08:24.910
- jesus.
- hey, hey.

08:24.944 --> 08:26.278
- get a load of this
asshole.

08:26.296 --> 08:29.048
- no shit, brosephina,
you spilled on my buddy here.

08:29.082 --> 08:32.001
- i did, sorry.

08:32.052 --> 08:33.251
- hey, uh, excuse me.

08:33.285 --> 08:34.453
- just, you know what,
let it go.

08:34.471 --> 08:36.337
- excuse me.
i don't mean to be a nudge.

08:36.389 --> 08:37.789
- let it go, hank, just--
you know, it's not worth--

08:37.808 --> 08:39.508
- just now,
when you said you were sorry,

08:39.558 --> 08:41.393
It didn't really sound like
you were sincere to me.

08:41.428 --> 08:43.345
It was, like,
"eh, i'm sorry."

08:43.395 --> 08:44.980
Perfunctory.

08:45.015 --> 08:46.482
- you understand that word?

08:46.516 --> 08:49.301
- man, i am sorry.
did i spill on your girlfriend?

08:49.319 --> 08:51.153
'cause i can get you and
your lady another drink.

08:51.188 --> 08:52.971
- oh.

08:52.989 --> 08:55.858
I believe our manhood
was just assailed.

08:55.909 --> 08:57.643
- i believe you're right.

08:57.661 --> 08:58.828
What are we going to do
about this?

08:58.862 --> 09:00.979
- i know what i'm going to do
about it.

09:02.982 --> 09:04.366
- whoa.

09:04.417 --> 09:05.701
Fuck, i knew it.

09:05.752 --> 09:08.487
Couple of real-life
faggots.

09:08.505 --> 09:10.089
- charlie.

09:10.123 --> 09:11.373
That's right, baby.

09:11.424 --> 09:15.661
We're here, we're queer,
and get used to it.

09:20.634 --> 09:22.334
- let me at him.

09:22.352 --> 09:25.054
- ? let it shine ?

09:25.105 --> 09:27.690
? let it shine ?

09:27.724 --> 09:29.892
? let it shine ?

09:31.945 --> 09:33.345
- thank you.

09:33.363 --> 09:34.814
- you might want to think
about popping a breath mint

09:34.848 --> 09:36.515
Or chewing some gum
every now and again.

09:36.533 --> 09:38.234
Your mouth tastes like
a hobo's taint.

09:38.285 --> 09:39.618
- why you got to do that?

09:39.653 --> 09:41.019
Why you got to make me feel
self-conscious?

09:41.037 --> 09:43.239
Do you have gum
or a breath mint or something?

09:43.290 --> 09:44.406
- what are we going to do now?

09:44.457 --> 09:46.292
- something fun, huh?

09:46.326 --> 09:48.861
Um, you want to go back
to my place,

09:48.879 --> 09:49.862
Watch some dvds?

09:49.880 --> 09:51.997
The girls are out
for the night.

09:52.031 --> 09:53.365
- i'm not
going to watch pornography

09:53.383 --> 09:54.533
With you, charlie runkle.

09:54.551 --> 09:55.885
Creeps me out.

09:55.919 --> 09:58.137
- we'll watch a regular movie.
i don't care.

09:58.171 --> 09:59.588
- no, no, no, the last time
you talked me into movie night,

09:59.639 --> 10:02.508
I sat there and watched you
play pocket pool for two hours.

10:02.542 --> 10:04.543
Men should not experience
pornography together.

10:04.561 --> 10:07.146
It's unseemly.
- excuse me, mr. morality.

10:07.180 --> 10:08.347
I didn't know
you had all these, you know,

10:08.381 --> 10:09.515
Special rules,
about home entertainment.

10:09.549 --> 10:10.900
- you know what?
the night is young.

10:10.934 --> 10:13.152
It's in diapers,
for christ's sakes.

10:13.186 --> 10:14.219
What do you say,
you and me,

10:14.237 --> 10:16.405
We go on
a good, old-fashioned bender?

10:16.439 --> 10:18.858
- aw,
i could roll with that.

10:18.892 --> 10:20.225
- you can roll with it?
- i can roll with it.

10:20.243 --> 10:22.778
- well, then, you roll
with it, motherfucker.

10:22.829 --> 10:24.663
- proceeding to roll.

10:27.701 --> 10:29.335
? ?

10:29.369 --> 10:31.203
- i think
i'm sewing it up.

10:31.237 --> 10:33.923
I tell you, seriously.
it has led me astray.

10:33.957 --> 10:36.175
- thank you.
- that's disgusting.

10:36.209 --> 10:39.962
And, also,
what's it going to solve?

10:40.013 --> 10:41.246
- i'm lost.

10:41.264 --> 10:45.417
Are you talking about
your heart or your vagina?

10:45.435 --> 10:46.585
- look at you.

10:46.603 --> 10:48.437
Using all the proper names
for things.

10:48.471 --> 10:51.256
- well, it is
her father's favorite word.

10:51.274 --> 10:53.943
- i'm speaking
of my vagina, sweetheart.

10:53.977 --> 10:55.444
I don't have
a heart anymore.

10:55.478 --> 10:57.313
I lost that years ago.

10:57.364 --> 11:00.649
I think it was the night
of the squirting incident.

11:00.700 --> 11:02.868
Remember that, huh?

11:02.903 --> 11:06.405
Okay, i'll say no more.

11:06.439 --> 11:07.907
- you know--you know what?

11:07.941 --> 11:09.375
You had the fantasy.

11:09.409 --> 11:10.776
I mean,
how many people can say

11:10.794 --> 11:12.795
That they slept with
their teen idol, right?

11:12.829 --> 11:13.796
That's--that's--

11:13.830 --> 11:14.797
- how many people
can say

11:14.831 --> 11:17.049
They slept with
rick springfield?

11:17.083 --> 11:20.669
Only every tramp, ho, and thief
in greater l.a. county.

11:20.720 --> 11:22.755
Ugh! bleh!

11:22.789 --> 11:24.423
Ah, what was i thinking?

11:24.457 --> 11:27.476
You just--you don't put yourself
out there like that.

11:27.510 --> 11:28.928
- it was good--it was good--
- take notes.

11:28.962 --> 11:31.814
- because you owed it
to your younger self, right?

11:31.848 --> 11:35.734
I mean, you needed to explore
that whole area.

11:35.769 --> 11:37.519
- really?

11:37.570 --> 11:39.605
Were there any areas
you explored

11:39.639 --> 11:41.473
When you was in
new york?

11:41.491 --> 11:43.976
- i don't think we need to--
- what, mom?

11:43.994 --> 11:46.362
- yes, please,
not in front of the child.

11:46.413 --> 11:48.480
- no, screw that.

11:48.498 --> 11:50.115
Tonight, you're a grown's-up.

11:50.149 --> 11:52.985
You're out on
girls' night out--g.n.o.

11:53.003 --> 11:54.837
You want a "zip"
of my wine?

11:54.871 --> 11:56.154
- marce.
- mm-hmm.

11:59.175 --> 12:07.165
? ?

12:12.355 --> 12:15.674
- oh, check it out.

12:15.692 --> 12:17.609
<i>south of heaven.
- no.</i>

12:17.644 --> 12:19.812
- first edition,
signed by the author.

12:19.846 --> 12:21.847
- portrait of the artist
as a dirty young man.

12:21.865 --> 12:23.148
What did i inscribe?

12:23.182 --> 12:26.184
- "to kelly:
best oral ever."

12:26.202 --> 12:30.072
Who is kelly?

12:30.123 --> 12:33.692
- i don't know.

12:33.710 --> 12:35.627
- i think we should find out.
- poor kelly.

12:35.662 --> 12:38.747
- sounds like
she had mad skills.

12:38.798 --> 12:42.334
- oh, early hank moody,
going for 100 big ones.

12:42.368 --> 12:43.919
- that real money?
maybe in pesos.

12:43.970 --> 12:46.889
- that's 100% john wayne-style
american dollar.

12:46.923 --> 12:48.057
- shit.

12:48.091 --> 12:49.224
People are willing
to pay good money

12:49.259 --> 12:51.010
For my early,
beer-soaked ramblings?

12:51.044 --> 12:52.678
I've increased in value.

12:52.712 --> 12:55.898
The franklin mint can lick me
where the good lord split me.

12:55.932 --> 12:57.349
- it's a shame that money
doesn't go to you.

12:57.383 --> 12:59.384
It goes to sleepy-eyes
over there.

12:59.402 --> 13:00.402
- no shit.

13:00.437 --> 13:01.887
I do all the work.

13:01.905 --> 13:04.606
And weird beard over there
profits off my words,

13:04.657 --> 13:08.277
My autograph, my memories
of sweet gifted kelly.

13:08.328 --> 13:10.245
It probably costs
100 bucks a week

13:10.280 --> 13:12.081
To keep him in tie dye
and birkenstocks

13:12.115 --> 13:13.365
And crystals.
- true "dat."

13:13.399 --> 13:14.366
And you know
there's no way

13:14.400 --> 13:16.285
I'm seeing my 10% either.

13:16.336 --> 13:18.070
- you could really use
that ten-spot right about now,

13:18.088 --> 13:20.956
Couldn't you.
- right?

13:21.007 --> 13:22.875
- cover me--i'm going
abbie hoffman on this shit.

13:22.909 --> 13:25.594
- oh, okay. hold on, hold on,
hold on, hold on, hold on.

13:25.628 --> 13:27.846
I got you.
- you know, runkle.

13:27.881 --> 13:29.631
Information...
- take it on home.

13:29.682 --> 13:31.917
- wants to be free.

13:34.187 --> 13:36.105
I think we're good.
- got it?

13:36.139 --> 13:37.606
- let's go.

13:37.640 --> 13:39.424
- we bad.

13:39.442 --> 13:41.226
We bad, we bad.
- stop that.

13:41.260 --> 13:42.277
- we bad.
- stop it.

13:42.312 --> 13:43.595
- wait, let me get you.
- no.

13:43.613 --> 13:44.596
- let me get you
covered, here.

13:44.614 --> 13:46.065
Let me get you.
- charlie.

13:46.099 --> 13:49.651
- i what?
- don't do that, you're an ass.

13:49.702 --> 13:52.270
- holy fuck, look at this.

13:52.288 --> 13:54.456
The artist within
gets himself an entire table.

13:54.491 --> 13:55.574
- all right,
how much does

13:55.608 --> 13:58.377
A first ejaculate
sir walter dali go for?

13:58.411 --> 14:00.278
- 95 bucks.
- yes.

14:00.296 --> 14:01.964
I win.

14:01.998 --> 14:06.001
Suck it and taste it,
artist within my yam bag.

14:10.056 --> 14:12.508
Hold on a second,
i got to let one rip.

14:12.559 --> 14:14.560
Switch with me?

14:14.594 --> 14:18.647
- okay, okay, okay.

14:24.070 --> 14:26.021
- come on.
- slow down!

14:26.072 --> 14:28.107
Come on, man.

14:28.141 --> 14:30.692
Whoa, ow, ow.
- get up.

14:30.743 --> 14:32.477
- i'm down.
man down.

14:32.495 --> 14:33.695
- get up.
get the man up.

14:33.746 --> 14:35.480
- okay, the man's up.
oh!

14:35.498 --> 14:38.167
- hey, don't fuck
with the pinkberry.

14:38.201 --> 14:40.335
- we can't stop.
we can't stop.

14:40.370 --> 14:43.839
- you know there's no one
chasing you, right, dad?

14:43.873 --> 14:45.674
- no?
- so there isn't.

14:45.708 --> 14:47.926
Phew.

14:47.961 --> 14:49.461
- this is fun.

14:49.495 --> 14:50.762
We have fun.

14:50.797 --> 14:52.714
- why are you looking at me
like that, you goon?

14:52.765 --> 14:54.499
- are you ready
for an adventure, marce?

14:54.517 --> 14:55.517
- no.

14:55.552 --> 14:57.269
Please stop doing that
with your face.

14:57.303 --> 14:59.671
- we should move
to new york, hmm,

14:59.689 --> 15:01.190
With our friends,
the van der moodys.

15:01.224 --> 15:03.025
- what?
- i did it.

15:03.059 --> 15:04.643
I got fired.

15:04.677 --> 15:07.563
Whoo!

15:07.614 --> 15:10.282
That's it--there's nothing
tying us here, man.

15:10.316 --> 15:12.517
You got dumped
by a pervy rock star,

15:12.535 --> 15:14.286
And i lost my job.
- well, tell everybody.

15:14.320 --> 15:19.041
- ? freedom's just
another word for ?

15:19.075 --> 15:22.194
? i'm a free bird ?
- he's freaking me out.

15:22.212 --> 15:23.328
- yeah, me too.

15:23.362 --> 15:26.698
- this is what two white winters
will do to you.

15:26.716 --> 15:28.867
- my deeny's sewn up
tighter than ever.

15:28.885 --> 15:30.969
- that was great, charlie.
congratulations.

15:31.004 --> 15:32.087
- come on, come with us.
- no.

15:32.138 --> 15:33.088
- the next stop
is the convenience store.

15:33.139 --> 15:34.089
Hey, hey.

15:34.140 --> 15:35.807
What kind of snacks
do you like?

15:35.842 --> 15:36.925
- stop it.

15:36.976 --> 15:38.260
- because i--i like snacks.
- you know what?

15:38.311 --> 15:40.545
It's--it's--it's past
our, um, bedtime.

15:40.563 --> 15:42.231
- what about us?
what about ours?

15:42.265 --> 15:43.982
- way past your bedtime.

15:44.017 --> 15:45.267
Come on.
no, you know what?

15:45.318 --> 15:46.735
You get to put yourself
to bed tonight.

15:46.769 --> 15:47.886
- you too, charles, from now on,
you're going to be changing

15:47.904 --> 15:50.055
Your own diapers
and wiping your own ass.

15:50.073 --> 15:52.241
I am done being your mommy.
- okay.

15:52.275 --> 15:53.909
But could you just please--
could you--

15:53.943 --> 15:55.861
Could you say ass
one more time again?

15:55.895 --> 15:57.162
Because i can work
with that for days.

15:57.197 --> 15:58.363
- i want you to have this.

15:58.397 --> 15:59.865
This is your heritage
and your inheritance.

15:59.899 --> 16:01.750
I liberated it
just moments ago.

16:01.784 --> 16:04.069
- what is that?
- stop it.

16:06.256 --> 16:08.090
- who's kelly?

16:09.759 --> 16:11.543
- i've been thinking about that
for, like, ten minutes.

16:11.577 --> 16:13.295
She's either

16:13.346 --> 16:15.931
A cocktail waitress
from toronto

16:15.965 --> 16:18.600
Or a very promising young
marine biologist.

16:18.635 --> 16:20.519
- either way, your father's
very lucky to have known her.

16:20.553 --> 16:22.471
- okay, that's it.
let's go.

16:22.522 --> 16:23.605
- okay.
- bye.

16:23.640 --> 16:25.891
- your loss, ladies.
- thank you.

16:25.925 --> 16:27.309
- i guess you're never
going to know the splendor

16:27.360 --> 16:29.478
Of a cheese doodle burp.
- stop selling, runkle.

16:29.529 --> 16:30.729
Come on.
- good point.

16:35.785 --> 16:38.453
- good evening.

16:38.488 --> 16:39.905
I think she liked me.

16:45.662 --> 16:48.380
- kim, wasabi?
- wasabi?

16:48.414 --> 16:50.666
- living the dreams, hank.
living the dream.

16:50.717 --> 16:52.634
- hey, you get the booze.
i'll get the snacks.

16:52.669 --> 16:54.303
- this is all the snack
a brother needs.

16:54.337 --> 16:55.787
- hey, you got
your guilty pleasures.

16:55.805 --> 16:56.788
I got mine.
i like--

16:56.806 --> 16:58.123
- oh!

16:58.141 --> 17:01.093
Ow! the humanity.

17:01.127 --> 17:04.179
- jesus christ, hank, come on.
- jesus, hank.

17:04.230 --> 17:05.180
- i'm sorry, kim.
i'll pay for it.

17:05.231 --> 17:06.765
- you bet your ass
you pay for it.

17:06.799 --> 17:08.133
- yeah.
- shit, man.

17:08.151 --> 17:09.467
- yeah, yeah.

17:09.484 --> 17:11.153
- you got scolded.
- yeah.

17:11.186 --> 17:13.805
- i heard it.

17:19.912 --> 17:21.663
- hey, i saw that.

17:21.698 --> 17:22.830
- saw what, homie?

17:22.865 --> 17:24.148
- what are you doing?
put that shit back.

17:24.166 --> 17:25.284
- the fuck you care?

17:25.318 --> 17:26.417
- what do i care?

17:26.452 --> 17:29.204
Kim and his wife...
kim are good people,

17:29.255 --> 17:30.339
And you're stealing
from them.

17:30.373 --> 17:31.623
You need money,
get a paper route or something.

17:31.657 --> 17:32.958
That's bullshit.
- whatever.

17:32.992 --> 17:34.209
- whatever?
- leave him alone, hank.

17:34.260 --> 17:36.345
- no, the kid's stealing.
that's not cool.

17:36.379 --> 17:37.713
- he's a kid,
and need i remind you,

17:37.764 --> 17:39.664
We borrowed ourselves
some hardcover nonfiction

17:39.682 --> 17:40.882
This very evening?

17:40.933 --> 17:42.718
- that is totally different.
- of course it is.

17:42.769 --> 17:45.387
- there's no law against
an author stealing his own work.

17:45.438 --> 17:47.005
- what about julian?

17:47.023 --> 17:48.473
- there's no law
against stealing

17:48.507 --> 17:50.559
From a colossal douchebag.

17:50.610 --> 17:52.227
Wait, check this out.
no, i got an idea.

17:52.278 --> 17:54.730
Hey. no, no.
no, it's cool.

17:54.781 --> 17:57.182
You put that shit back,
and i'll give you this book.

17:57.200 --> 17:58.817
People swear by it.
it'll change your life.

17:58.851 --> 18:00.185
Put you
on the straight and narrow.

18:00.203 --> 18:02.120
And if it doesn't,
you can use it as toilet paper.

18:02.155 --> 18:05.490
<i>check it out.
the artist within.</i>

18:05.524 --> 18:07.209
- hank.
- my ass.

18:07.243 --> 18:08.627
- here you go.
- hank.

18:08.661 --> 18:09.628
- yeah, take it, take it.
shut up, charlie,

18:09.662 --> 18:11.213
I'm schooling this kid.
- hank.

18:11.247 --> 18:14.082
- what, what?

18:14.133 --> 18:15.217
Ah, ah!

18:15.251 --> 18:16.218
- dude, give me
your fucking wallet, man.

18:16.252 --> 18:17.552
- yeah, yeah.
- all right.

18:17.587 --> 18:18.870
- okay, just take it easy.
- hurry the fuck up, man.

18:18.888 --> 18:20.339
- you win, all right.
settle down.

18:20.373 --> 18:21.757
No, you got it.
you got it.

18:21.808 --> 18:23.759
- take it easy.
- shut the fuck up.

18:23.810 --> 18:28.230
- just take it.
treat yourself.

18:28.264 --> 18:29.564
- what, are you kidding me?

18:29.599 --> 18:31.400
What the fuck?
what the fuck is this?

18:31.434 --> 18:33.985
- i work on commission, bro.
- shut the fuck up.

18:34.020 --> 18:36.054
You think this is
a fucking joke?

18:36.072 --> 18:41.393
- i got a daughter.

18:41.411 --> 18:42.744
- oh, shit.

18:42.779 --> 18:44.729
- get out of my store,
motherfuckers!

18:44.747 --> 18:46.415
get out!

18:46.449 --> 18:48.500
you motherfuckers!

18:48.534 --> 18:50.752
fuck you!

18:50.787 --> 18:54.206
Get back here!
- fuck me.

19:06.602 --> 19:08.387
- ah, right on,
let's go.

19:21.033 --> 19:22.984
- i thought
that was it, hank.

19:23.035 --> 19:24.453
The end.

19:24.487 --> 19:28.657
- i know
what you mean, broheme.

19:28.708 --> 19:31.243
- what was going
through your head?

19:31.277 --> 19:33.445
- what do you think?

19:33.463 --> 19:35.297
Karen and becca.

19:35.331 --> 19:36.798
And how much i love them.

19:36.833 --> 19:40.969
And how much time i've wasted
being a selfish prick.

19:41.003 --> 19:42.471
What a cosmic fuck-you
it would be

19:42.505 --> 19:44.055
If you were
the last person i kissed

19:44.090 --> 19:45.557
Before i died.

19:45.591 --> 19:47.426
- i don't know.

19:47.460 --> 19:49.627
I think it would have been
kind of poetic, actually.

19:49.645 --> 19:53.131
- for you, maybe.

19:53.149 --> 19:54.649
- i know what you mean,
though.

19:54.684 --> 19:57.519
I had my whole life
flash before my eyes, really.

19:57.570 --> 20:00.939
Just like, uh, like a tivo
on fast-forward.

20:00.973 --> 20:02.640
And you know what?

20:02.658 --> 20:04.743
It was
really fucking pathetic.

20:04.777 --> 20:09.247
- oh, i believe you.

20:09.282 --> 20:14.002
- okay, what now?
where do we go from here?

20:14.036 --> 20:15.170
- i'm not entirely sure.

20:15.204 --> 20:16.705
But if you thought
we were drinking before,

20:16.756 --> 20:19.090
You were dead wrong
because now--

20:20.376 --> 20:22.210
- we are going to do
some drinking. you with me?

20:22.261 --> 20:24.662
- oh, till the end,
my nubian brother.

20:24.680 --> 20:27.215
Till the bitter end.

20:28.718 --> 20:29.935
I love you, bro.

20:29.969 --> 20:33.021
- hey, settle down.
don't soil yourself.

20:33.055 --> 20:35.507
Again.

20:35.525 --> 20:37.859
- make the car
go very fast.

20:39.145 --> 20:41.229
- okay, just one drink.

20:41.280 --> 20:44.115
So that missy here
doesn't slit her wrists

20:44.150 --> 20:46.034
When she's left all alone.

20:46.068 --> 20:47.452
- oh, but you forget.

20:47.487 --> 20:49.020
I won't be alone.

20:49.038 --> 20:52.357
'cause i got yertle the turtle
as my roommate.

20:52.375 --> 20:55.544
All the disadvantages
of being married

20:55.578 --> 20:57.162
And none of the advantages.

20:57.196 --> 21:00.549
- and what would those be,
if you don't mind my asking?

21:00.583 --> 21:01.866
- those what?

21:01.884 --> 21:03.868
- the advantages
of being married.

21:03.886 --> 21:06.922
I need to know so i don't
end up as bitter as you guys.

21:06.973 --> 21:08.373
- shit, is that
how we sound?

21:08.391 --> 21:10.875
- so far i haven't heard much
in the pro-men column.

21:10.893 --> 21:12.928
The best
you can hope for, i guess,

21:12.979 --> 21:15.046
Is that they make you laugh
and occasionally

21:15.064 --> 21:16.648
Fix things
around the house.

21:16.682 --> 21:20.068
- yeah, that would be great.
what?

21:20.102 --> 21:22.437
I would kill for a guy
to fix things around the house.

21:22.488 --> 21:25.073
- what we meant to say was--
- don't look at me.

21:25.107 --> 21:27.526
I know i'm bitter.
i own that shit.

21:27.560 --> 21:30.662
I ams who i's ams.
- well, i'm not bitter.

21:30.696 --> 21:33.198
Am i bitter?

21:33.232 --> 21:34.749
Maybe i am.

21:34.784 --> 21:36.368
I'm disillusioned.
that's what i am.

21:36.402 --> 21:38.587
I'm definitely
disillusioned.

21:38.621 --> 21:40.455
- come on, mom.
what did you think would happen?

21:40.506 --> 21:41.456
Did you think
if you left

21:41.507 --> 21:43.341
He would grow up
all of a sudden?

21:43.376 --> 21:44.742
- no, i just--

21:44.760 --> 21:45.794
You know,
i wish we didn't

21:45.845 --> 21:48.263
Have to prop him up
all the time.

21:48.297 --> 21:49.464
- so what's the point
in wishing for something

21:49.515 --> 21:52.183
That's never
going to come true?

21:52.218 --> 21:54.352
He's never
going to change, mom.

21:54.387 --> 21:56.888
He's always going to be
that drunken fool

21:56.922 --> 21:59.808
In the middle
of abbot kinney.

21:59.859 --> 22:05.614
The same guy
who wrote this book.

22:05.648 --> 22:07.032
And if that's not
what you want,

22:07.066 --> 22:09.985
Then you have to be
the one to walk away.

22:10.036 --> 22:12.270
Because he never will.

22:13.873 --> 22:15.907
- god, jesus.

22:15.941 --> 22:18.443
I love this little buddha
you shot out of your vag.

22:18.461 --> 22:20.912
So wise.

22:42.635 --> 22:43.685
Mm.

22:43.736 --> 22:47.989
- jesus.

22:48.024 --> 22:52.110
Feel like i've been fucked
in the ass by god himself.

22:52.144 --> 22:57.082
And he--he--he pulled out
and jizzed all over my face.

22:57.116 --> 23:00.418
Got in my eyes, and now
i can't even open them properly.

23:00.453 --> 23:02.987
- i'm hungry.
you?

23:03.005 --> 23:05.624
- so our ladies must be
worried sick about us, huh?

23:05.658 --> 23:09.094
You know why?
- why?

23:09.128 --> 23:10.845
- 'cause we're
a couple of dirty stay-outs.

23:10.880 --> 23:12.830
- no missed calls.

23:16.835 --> 23:19.938
- huh, me neither.

23:19.972 --> 23:22.140
Well, whatever.

23:22.174 --> 23:26.728
Oh, this was fun.
we should do this more often.

23:26.779 --> 23:30.699
- you know, i can do this
because i'm an artist.

23:30.733 --> 23:32.951
But you?
you're a fucking businessman.

23:32.985 --> 23:34.686
A sucker
in a three-piece suit.

23:34.704 --> 23:36.521
You got to keep
your shit together.

23:36.539 --> 23:38.406
- doesn't sound
very fair at all.

23:38.457 --> 23:40.041
- i didn't make the rules.

23:44.964 --> 23:48.466
You know, you're a good friend,
you bald motherfucker.

23:48.501 --> 23:50.051
I'm lucky to have you.

23:50.086 --> 23:52.087
- same here, buddy.

23:52.138 --> 23:54.089
You're a really good kisser,
too, you know that?

23:54.140 --> 23:57.592
Karen doesn't know what
she's missing right now.

23:57.643 --> 23:58.760
- there's a good chance
i would have

23:58.811 --> 24:00.228
Forgotten about that.
- oh, no.

24:00.262 --> 24:03.481
- thanks for calling it back.

24:03.516 --> 24:06.851
- god, i am sore.

24:06.885 --> 24:09.354
My fucking back
is killing me.

24:09.388 --> 24:11.690
Got quite a workout
last night, huh?

24:17.496 --> 24:20.732
- hey, charlie?
- yeah.

24:20.750 --> 24:23.334
- did we get
tattoos last night?

24:23.369 --> 24:27.839
- did we what?

24:27.873 --> 24:29.874
Oh, no, hank.

24:29.908 --> 24:31.760
Hank, what did i do?

24:31.794 --> 24:34.345
- i don't know,
but we're about to find out.

24:34.380 --> 24:36.297
Bend over, big boy,
and drop your drawers.

24:36.348 --> 24:37.749
And i hope
that's the last time

24:37.767 --> 24:39.100
I ever say that to you.

24:39.135 --> 24:41.469
- jesus christ,
say it ain't so, hank.

24:41.520 --> 24:43.388
- whoo.

24:43.422 --> 24:44.422
Oh, it is so.

24:44.440 --> 24:47.759
It is definitely so.

24:47.777 --> 24:49.144
- why would you
let me do that, hank?

24:49.195 --> 24:50.762
Why would you let me
get a tramp stamp?

24:50.780 --> 24:52.147
Why--why would you
do that to me?

24:52.198 --> 24:54.766
- look on the bright side.
it's a beautiful tattoo.

24:54.784 --> 24:57.485
The artist definitely
outdid his self.

24:57.536 --> 25:00.455
- jesus christ,
it's a god damn butterfly,

25:00.489 --> 25:02.123
Isn't it hank?
now i remember.

25:02.158 --> 25:04.209
It's all coming back to me.

25:04.243 --> 25:06.911
I'm such
a fucking idiot.

25:06.945 --> 25:08.946
Okay, all right, come on.
let's go.

25:08.964 --> 25:10.799
We're going
to the removal place right now.

25:10.833 --> 25:12.834
Let's go.
hey.

25:17.056 --> 25:19.841
- come on, let's go!

25:37.309 --> 25:40.361
- good morning.
- morning.

25:40.412 --> 25:41.780
- how was your night?

25:41.814 --> 25:44.649
- you know, it was great.
it was really good.

25:44.667 --> 25:46.534
- great.

25:46.585 --> 25:47.702
- yours?

25:47.753 --> 25:49.337
- mine was interesting.

25:49.371 --> 25:53.541
Definitely had its moments.

25:53.592 --> 25:57.095
I didn't fuck anyone,
if that's what you're wondering.

25:57.129 --> 26:00.998
- uh, no, i wasn't,
actually.

26:01.016 --> 26:02.801
- bullshit.

26:02.835 --> 26:05.670
How's marcy?

26:05.688 --> 26:07.388
- uh, she'll live,
you know.

26:07.439 --> 26:09.507
- well, that's good.

26:09.525 --> 26:13.194
And you?
how are you?

26:13.229 --> 26:15.680
- i'm trying.

26:15.698 --> 26:19.317
- that's all
anybody can ask, huh?

26:19.351 --> 26:21.703
- right.

26:26.625 --> 26:28.660
- hey, check this out.

26:28.694 --> 26:31.129
- hank, don't--
- no, no, no. no.

26:37.920 --> 26:39.087
Huh?

26:40.923 --> 26:42.423
Am i supposed
to be impressed?

26:42.474 --> 26:46.144
- that's the idea, yeah.

26:46.178 --> 26:48.263
- hmm.

26:48.314 --> 26:49.547
- hmm?

26:49.565 --> 26:51.432
I scar myself for you.

26:51.483 --> 26:52.934
I stigmatize myself for you.

26:52.985 --> 26:57.388
And that's all i get
as a response, is "hmm?"

26:57.406 --> 26:59.524
Hmm?

26:59.558 --> 27:02.243
- ? can you see the light ?

27:03.562 --> 27:07.248
- ? can you hear the hum ?

27:07.283 --> 27:08.900
? of our song ?

27:08.918 --> 27:11.569
- are you hungry?

27:11.587 --> 27:14.923
- ? i hope they
get it right ?

27:14.957 --> 27:16.758
- would you like
some breakfast?

27:16.792 --> 27:19.243
- ? i hope we
dance tonight ?

27:19.261 --> 27:21.846
- i would love
some breakfast.

27:21.881 --> 27:24.432
- ? before we
get it wrong ?

27:24.466 --> 27:27.352
? now i see you ?

27:27.386 --> 27:28.553
? till kingdom come ?

27:28.587 --> 27:32.307

to see me ?

27:32.358 --> 27:35.259
