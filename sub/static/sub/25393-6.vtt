WEBVTT

00:36.621 --> 00:38.039
I just don't understand.

00:39.249 --> 00:40.750
I've been to Hell and back...

00:41.459 --> 00:42.502
to that.

00:43.378 --> 00:44.671
Everyone's dead.

00:46.089 --> 00:47.674
I don't get it. What was the point?

00:49.968 --> 00:51.094
Unless...

00:51.177 --> 00:52.929
Unless going to Hell is what saves me.

00:54.180 --> 00:56.349
If it hadn't been for Hell,
I'd be dead now, too.

00:57.267 --> 00:58.351
Which means...

00:59.227 --> 01:00.812
It means God wants me alive.

01:01.396 --> 01:02.397
Yeah.

01:02.689 --> 01:03.690
Of course, I'm...

01:04.065 --> 01:05.191
part of a plan...

01:06.985 --> 01:09.237
a bigger purpose
that God has in mind for me.

01:10.029 --> 01:11.030
Something...

01:11.322 --> 01:13.199
something he is going to reveal
when the time is right.

01:14.409 --> 01:15.410
I get it now.

01:16.995 --> 01:18.621
My story is just beginning.

01:20.790 --> 01:21.791
Here's a story.

01:22.417 --> 01:25.962
When I was four, my mom
shot my dad for stabbing her.

01:26.755 --> 01:29.632
They both died.
Went to live with my aunt.

01:30.008 --> 01:32.552
Her meth cook blew. She died.

01:33.219 --> 01:35.138
Went to stay with my grandma.

01:35.221 --> 01:37.390
She was church-y, like you,

01:37.474 --> 01:39.768
but she didn't try to trick me
or hit me with hand tools.

01:40.894 --> 01:42.562
She was chill.

01:43.146 --> 01:45.690
But she choked on a peach pit
during breakfast,

01:46.232 --> 01:48.067
turned purple, puffy.

01:48.818 --> 01:49.903
She died.

01:52.071 --> 01:53.114
The end.

01:58.369 --> 01:59.579
At least you survived, right?

02:00.830 --> 02:01.831
That's good.

02:03.082 --> 02:04.209
Maybe you write a book about it?

02:04.292 --> 02:05.919
Dude, you in an orphanage.

02:06.002 --> 02:10.423
You're ugly, you're crazy,
and I think you might be stupid, too.

02:11.174 --> 02:12.550
This is the end of the line.

02:12.634 --> 02:14.177
Your story ends here.

02:15.595 --> 02:18.431
<i>Root, Eugene.
You've been adopted.</i>

02:26.481 --> 02:29.484
Eugene,
there's someone here to see you.

02:44.165 --> 02:45.166
Who are you?

02:46.876 --> 02:48.670
This is your new foster parent.

02:55.385 --> 02:58.137
Just a little paperwork,
and then you both can be on your way.

02:59.556 --> 03:01.808
Um, sir? About that paperwork?

03:08.022 --> 03:09.274
Lucky son of a bitch.

03:16.364 --> 03:18.658
You're not actually adopting me...
are you?

03:20.285 --> 03:21.494
You're taking me back.

03:22.412 --> 03:24.372
That doesn't make any sense.
Why would God bring me back here?

03:24.455 --> 03:25.456
I don't get it.

03:27.750 --> 03:29.419
God ain't got nothin' to do with it.

03:31.004 --> 03:32.130
Do you understand?

03:33.089 --> 03:34.090
No.

03:35.425 --> 03:36.426
I don't.

03:38.052 --> 03:40.346
God's got something to do
with everything.

03:44.100 --> 03:45.101
Can you put me down, please?

03:45.184 --> 03:47.478
You're... you're
pulling on my chest hairs.

04:02.368 --> 04:03.369
So...

04:04.787 --> 04:06.289
we're walking back?

04:07.415 --> 04:08.791
Got to make a stop first.

04:12.003 --> 04:13.379
Take all the stops you need.

04:15.715 --> 04:17.216
Let's see where this story takes us!

04:18.343 --> 04:19.594
It takes us to Hell.

05:07.433 --> 05:09.894
I am Eccarius.

05:10.979 --> 05:15.149
Welcome to Les Enfants du Sang. Mmm.

05:15.233 --> 05:17.193
Children of Blood.

05:17.276 --> 05:19.153
I know. I know. You keep saying it.

05:19.779 --> 05:20.863
My God.

05:21.572 --> 05:22.907
Oh, me arse.

05:23.866 --> 05:27.537
- What the hell do you want?
- Your, um, clothes.

05:27.954 --> 05:29.122
He means to wash them.

05:29.580 --> 05:32.000
- They're quite filthy.
- Oh, yeah. Right.

05:32.959 --> 05:34.377
Yeah, I'm gonna strip for you

05:34.460 --> 05:36.879
right after I let you make-believers
paint my fingernails.

05:36.963 --> 05:40.383
Will you just stop it?
Dude, stop with the piano, all right?

05:40.466 --> 05:42.260
Thank you so much.

05:48.725 --> 05:50.852
So, you lot,
you all want to be vampires, huh?

05:51.269 --> 05:52.437
More than anything.

05:53.104 --> 05:54.731
Mmm. Yeah, right.

05:55.773 --> 05:57.817
You all want to be hated, spat on,

05:57.900 --> 05:59.610
chased down by assholes,

05:59.694 --> 06:01.529
have everyone you ever
loved or cared about...

06:01.612 --> 06:02.905
They get old, they just die,

06:02.989 --> 06:04.741
and leave you on your own, you know?

06:04.824 --> 06:06.200
You get so bloody bored,

06:06.284 --> 06:09.495
you drink engine coolant
just to feel something new, all right?

06:10.329 --> 06:12.540
Is that what you want,
you bunch of bloody posers, is it?

06:13.416 --> 06:14.500
You have us wrong.

06:15.293 --> 06:17.628
This is a collection of men and women

06:17.712 --> 06:22.341
dedicated to protecting
the Ways Of the Night.

06:22.425 --> 06:25.845
I am their Lord.

06:26.429 --> 06:28.264
They are my Children.

06:28.765 --> 06:30.266
I'm no poseur.

06:30.475 --> 06:33.311
Oh. No, it's not poseur, like that.

06:33.394 --> 06:34.687
It's poser, isn't it?

06:34.771 --> 06:35.813
- And...
- Kevin?

06:39.192 --> 06:41.527
Memaw, not now! We're busy!

06:41.611 --> 06:42.987
Sorry.

06:43.071 --> 06:44.655
Didn't know you had guests.

06:47.075 --> 06:48.868
Jesus Christ, you guys are lame.

06:48.951 --> 06:50.620
I'm leaving. It's a "no," friend.

06:50.703 --> 06:54.373
"Anything that's new"?
Is that what you say you seek?

06:56.751 --> 06:58.169
I bet I could show you something.

06:58.753 --> 07:00.421
I bet you couldn't
show me a single thing

07:00.505 --> 07:02.256
I haven't already seen a hundred times.

07:03.633 --> 07:04.842
Ever seen this?

07:18.606 --> 07:19.649
Mmm.

07:23.986 --> 07:26.447
See, brother? I'm no poser.

07:27.532 --> 07:28.616
Mmm.

08:17.540 --> 08:20.376
This is happenin', kid.
Ain't nothin' you can do.

08:20.585 --> 08:23.171
And she brought it
on herself, Lil' Jesse.

08:23.254 --> 08:25.506
Now, I gave her
some of my special number

08:25.590 --> 08:27.049
to make it as painless as possible,

08:27.133 --> 08:29.093
but the fact remains,
she tried to kill Miss Marie.

08:29.177 --> 08:32.221
That's because
Sabina told her to, you assholes.

08:32.304 --> 08:33.597
She's the one to be mad at.

08:35.558 --> 08:36.808
How long they got?

08:36.893 --> 08:40.395
Her heart, it hurt bad.
Without her medicine?

08:41.105 --> 08:42.315
Less than a day.

08:47.195 --> 08:48.404
Let me ask you a question.

08:48.905 --> 08:51.949
You want to buy Gran'ma some time
by feedin' her one soul?

08:53.117 --> 08:55.953
Or you want to save her god-damned life
with a bunch of 'em?

08:57.413 --> 08:58.748
'Cause if you want to save her,

08:59.874 --> 09:01.167
we need to rob a bank.

09:01.834 --> 09:05.713
You're talking about Sabina's bank.
The one she keep all her souls in.

09:05.796 --> 09:08.299
Got security up the yin yang.
We tried it before.

09:08.382 --> 09:10.051
I'm sure you have.

09:10.134 --> 09:11.802
But you didn't have
Tulip before, did you?

09:12.762 --> 09:15.139
Lil' Jesse's got a plan.

09:15.723 --> 09:16.766
We're listenin'.

09:17.183 --> 09:21.562
Well, the first thing I think
we need to do is kill them both.

09:24.106 --> 09:25.316
Tulip and Gran'ma,

09:25.399 --> 09:27.401
we kill them, and we bury them.

09:28.611 --> 09:29.695
I don't get it.

09:30.404 --> 09:31.405
I do.

09:35.826 --> 09:37.787
God moves in a mysterious way.

09:39.747 --> 09:41.290
His wonders to perform.

09:44.293 --> 09:46.462
He plants his footsteps in the sea,

09:48.381 --> 09:51.425
and rides upon the storm. Amen.

09:51.842 --> 09:52.969
Amen.

10:03.729 --> 10:05.439
Looks like his girlfriend
took your advice.

10:05.648 --> 10:06.774
<i>They're both dead.</i>

10:13.823 --> 10:16.242
Such a beautiful service.

10:17.535 --> 10:19.078
Was he the only one who cried?

10:20.204 --> 10:23.040
Third time you've died, Tulip.
I'm all out of tears.

10:23.124 --> 10:24.125
Still.

10:27.795 --> 10:29.922
Hey, I was thinkin',

10:30.756 --> 10:32.633
remember that job we did in Las Cruces?

10:32.717 --> 10:33.926
Mmm-hmm.

10:42.184 --> 10:43.311
Remember this?

10:44.895 --> 10:46.772
Hell yes, I remember that.

10:50.192 --> 10:52.194
All right, bitches, clock's ticking.

10:53.070 --> 10:54.613
Let's go steal some shit.

11:27.646 --> 11:32.401
$100, $200, $300,
$400, $500, $600, $700.

11:56.842 --> 11:58.052
Phew!

11:58.636 --> 12:00.054
That's a lot of security.

12:00.221 --> 12:01.514
We're a small-town bank,

12:01.597 --> 12:04.683
but our customers sleep better
knowing their valuables are secure.

12:05.059 --> 12:06.769
Well, they must be sleepin' great.

12:07.103 --> 12:09.271
Let me just open your new box.

12:09.772 --> 12:12.191
Oh, I seen one of them before.
You just put your...

12:18.030 --> 12:19.073
Tongue across it.

12:19.156 --> 12:22.660
We upgraded the old system.
New Asian technology.

12:22.743 --> 12:26.247
Each safety deposit box can only
be opened by its owner's saliva.

12:26.330 --> 12:27.373
Cool, huh?

12:27.832 --> 12:29.959
Really cool.

12:31.961 --> 12:33.921
Well, thank you for your time, Carter.

12:34.004 --> 12:36.257
Anything else we can
help you with, Ms. Pomerantz?

12:37.133 --> 12:38.217
No, I don't...

12:39.844 --> 12:40.928
My glasses.

12:47.059 --> 12:50.146
Oh, one more thing.
Um, what time do you close?

12:50.229 --> 12:51.272
05:00 sharp.

12:53.566 --> 12:54.567
Well, okay, then.

12:58.320 --> 12:59.697
Any word yet on the vampire?

12:59.780 --> 13:01.574
Still searching, sir.

13:01.657 --> 13:04.452
How hard can it be to
find an Irish demon

13:04.535 --> 13:07.621
carted off by a hooting pack
of cape-wearing nobodies?

13:08.247 --> 13:09.582
Well, it is New Orleans, sir.

13:10.082 --> 13:11.834
I seek power, Hoover.

13:11.917 --> 13:16.005
Untrammeled authority to
force this disordered world to its knees

13:16.088 --> 13:18.299
so it may weep and
grovel at my jackboot.

13:18.382 --> 13:19.383
Great.

13:19.467 --> 13:23.846
In order to amass this power,
I need to squeeze Jesse Custer.

13:23.929 --> 13:27.433
In order to achieve that squeezing,
I need leverage.

13:27.516 --> 13:31.604
In order to gain said leverage,
I need to...

13:37.193 --> 13:38.194
Find the vampire. Yes.

13:38.277 --> 13:39.653
I'll reach out to my police contacts.

13:39.737 --> 13:43.699
We can't use the usual channels.
Allfather is watching us.

13:43.782 --> 13:45.534
He has eyes and ears everywhere.

13:45.993 --> 13:47.661
He seems more fat than scary.

13:47.745 --> 13:50.915
Don't be fooled.
The Allfather is a cold killer.

13:50.998 --> 13:55.878
He makes me look like
a conscientious objector.

13:55.961 --> 13:59.507
Do you know what I saw him do
once to a man who displeased him?

14:01.217 --> 14:02.510
No! No!

14:05.262 --> 14:08.849
You have transgressed, brother.

14:12.520 --> 14:16.690
And that was for touching
the Allfather's Hot Pocket.

14:17.441 --> 14:19.443
We are plotting a coup.

14:19.527 --> 14:21.862
Imagine what he'd do to us.

14:21.946 --> 14:24.532
I'm relying on you, Hoover.

14:26.367 --> 14:27.868
What is taking so long?

14:29.119 --> 14:30.246
Oh.

14:30.871 --> 14:32.081
Forgot to push the button.

14:35.626 --> 14:38.337
Tonight, we perform our blood ceremony.

14:39.880 --> 14:40.923
Jesus.

14:41.006 --> 14:44.510
Who's prepared
to lie back and take flight?

14:48.681 --> 14:50.558
Deng, my child.

14:53.018 --> 14:54.103
Are you ready?

14:55.271 --> 14:56.397
I think so, my Lord.

15:04.738 --> 15:05.739
You are.

15:07.658 --> 15:08.867
Until tonight.

15:16.959 --> 15:19.461
Mrs. Rosen doesn't allow
smoking down here.

15:20.671 --> 15:22.006
Who the hell's Mrs. Rosen?

15:22.089 --> 15:25.134
Kevin's grandmother.
A lovely woman. Terrific cook.

15:25.217 --> 15:26.552
She also provides cover

15:26.635 --> 15:28.512
- in case of interlopers.
- Oh.

15:28.596 --> 15:31.223
Must be beating back the interlopers
with a stick around here, huh?

15:32.266 --> 15:34.643
Will you join us for tonight's ceremony?
I think you'll enjoy it.

15:34.727 --> 15:37.313
I'd love to,
but I got a date with Bourbon Street.

15:37.396 --> 15:38.647
Thanks for the fluff and fold.

15:38.731 --> 15:39.732
That's a pity.

15:40.441 --> 15:42.901
I've waited such a long time
to meet someone like

15:44.069 --> 15:45.070
me.

15:46.280 --> 15:48.157
- Can I ask you a couple of questions?
- Of course.

15:48.699 --> 15:50.409
You're like royalty, right?

15:50.868 --> 15:53.621
I am the Ninth Earl of Saxon-On-Thames.

15:53.704 --> 15:55.748
Right. And you speak like, what,
like eight...

15:55.831 --> 15:57.666
- Eight languages or something?
- Mmm. Nineteen.

15:57.750 --> 15:59.793
Nineteen. You play classical music?

15:59.877 --> 16:01.962
On my harp. Bach <i>Sonatas,</i> mainly.

16:02.046 --> 16:04.381
And you enjoy taking molly caps
and going to strip clubs?

16:04.465 --> 16:05.924
- Well, I wouldn't...
- Listen.

16:06.008 --> 16:08.135
You and I are nothing alike, mate.

16:08.218 --> 16:11.388
Ah, but we are. Ancient ones, both.

16:11.472 --> 16:14.475
Night Wraiths.
Travelers of the Last Dawn.

16:14.933 --> 16:16.769
You're a bloody joke, is what you are!

16:16.852 --> 16:18.270
You're a cliché, mate.

16:18.354 --> 16:20.356
Bloody "Night Wraith."
Please. You're just a vampire!

16:20.439 --> 16:22.691
Of course. What's wrong with that?

16:22.775 --> 16:25.319
What's wrong with it is
being a vampire sucks, all right?

16:25.944 --> 16:27.237
- Does it, now?
- Yes.

16:28.739 --> 16:30.282
Perhaps you've been doing it wrong.

16:33.827 --> 16:37.164
Three guards. Glocks.
Vault guy's got an 870 shotgun.

16:37.247 --> 16:40.250
Dozen CCTVs, six fixed, six sweeping.

16:40.334 --> 16:44.588
Manager keys his safe door,
then hits a 14-bit keypad.

16:45.047 --> 16:46.215
In other words?

16:49.051 --> 16:50.052
Piece of cake.

17:01.230 --> 17:02.815
Seven-minute response time.

17:04.483 --> 17:05.608
That enough time?

17:05.943 --> 17:07.152
Wish it were more.

17:10.406 --> 17:11.740
We can buy you some.

17:14.410 --> 17:15.661
Okay.

17:15.743 --> 17:19.123
It means you got until 05:00
to get us some spit.

17:28.882 --> 17:30.134
Good morning, sir.

17:30.217 --> 17:33.137
There goes my morning erection.
Messages?

17:33.512 --> 17:36.014
Xi Jinping, Robert Mueller,
Meghan Markle...

17:36.098 --> 17:37.474
- Is that shit?
- Yes, sir.

17:37.558 --> 17:40.144
- His own?
- Yes, for the most part.

17:40.602 --> 17:42.688
He's on time-out
before his ballroom dancing lesson.

17:42.771 --> 17:46.358
Durando's hosing him down as we speak.
Love the new hat, sir.

17:47.151 --> 17:48.193
Very...

17:48.318 --> 17:49.486
<i>Cabaret.</i>

17:49.653 --> 17:52.448
I was thinking the same thing,
the Liza Minnelli role.

17:54.616 --> 17:56.618
I need to be alone.

17:56.869 --> 17:58.829
Uh, sir, one last thing...

18:10.215 --> 18:12.384
Thrice blessed, O Starr.

18:25.647 --> 18:26.940
I heard about your loss.

18:28.650 --> 18:29.651
Sorry.

18:30.861 --> 18:31.862
Thanks.

18:33.447 --> 18:36.241
I also heard you were down here
beating up guys for no good reason.

18:36.742 --> 18:39.661
My girlfriend killed my gran'ma,
and now she's dead, too.

18:39.745 --> 18:41.538
Seemed like reason enough for me.

18:43.165 --> 18:46.251
You didn't want me to come here?
Draw me out?

18:48.170 --> 18:50.214
Well, if you did, it worked.

18:50.297 --> 18:53.509
Here I am, me and my friends.

18:54.968 --> 18:56.845
What would I want
with you and your friends?

18:56.929 --> 18:58.263
Oh, I don't know.

18:59.097 --> 19:01.725
Maybe you figured
I had something to do with it?

19:06.730 --> 19:10.025
If I figured you had
something to do with Tulip's death...

19:11.652 --> 19:14.571
I would spit in your face
and break your neck

19:14.655 --> 19:18.325
before any of your "friends" could take
two steps across the room.

19:18.408 --> 19:19.618
Hmm.

19:24.122 --> 19:27.084
You didn't do anything. I screwed up.

19:27.251 --> 19:28.544
You're damn right.

19:29.711 --> 19:32.214
From the moment you walked out on me,

19:32.297 --> 19:33.882
from the moment you killed my brother.

19:33.966 --> 19:36.134
Oh, give me a break from that bullshit.

19:37.719 --> 19:39.179
I don't like what happened to Kenny.

19:40.597 --> 19:42.850
- It was self-defense, and you know it.
- You killed him.

19:43.642 --> 19:44.977
And you liked it plenty.

19:47.396 --> 19:49.857
You're a goddamn murderer.
I should spit in your face.

19:51.108 --> 19:52.234
Well, go on, then.

19:53.652 --> 19:56.446
Spit in my face, you bitch.

19:58.115 --> 19:59.616
Then we can call it even.

20:03.328 --> 20:05.163
I'll spit on your grave.

20:11.086 --> 20:12.796
Nothing to live for, anyway.

20:15.966 --> 20:17.175
So that's a date.

20:29.062 --> 20:31.523
You know, sometimes I think about
when we were kids.

20:34.067 --> 20:35.569
I liked you so much.

20:37.654 --> 20:38.780
I liked you, too.

20:42.492 --> 20:45.495
I mean, you were the first boy
that took me shoplifting on a date.

20:45.579 --> 20:48.248
You were the first girl
to play me Johnny Cash.

20:48.332 --> 20:51.585
- That's right. <i>Man in Black.</i>
- Mmm-hmm.

20:51.668 --> 20:52.961
Mmm-hmm.

20:57.966 --> 21:01.053
Can I ask you a question?
Do you promise to tell me the truth?

21:02.846 --> 21:05.641
Would it make me
the worst person in the world...

21:07.643 --> 21:10.479
if I kissed you on the day
I buried my girlfriend?

21:12.773 --> 21:13.774
Yeah.

21:16.026 --> 21:17.069
It would.

21:25.619 --> 21:27.120
Well, that took forever.

21:31.541 --> 21:32.668
Worth it, though, right?

21:34.169 --> 21:37.547
The plan was for her
to spit in your face.

21:37.965 --> 21:39.383
Yeah. Well, I had to improvise.

21:40.801 --> 21:43.512
Well, lucky you just happened
to bring along your tongue scraper, huh?

21:43.887 --> 21:45.722
Yeah, that's real lucky.

21:47.432 --> 21:48.558
It'll still work, right?

21:50.143 --> 21:51.353
Yeah, probably.

21:51.436 --> 21:53.188
All right, then.
Quit complainin' and let's go.

22:03.365 --> 22:04.616
You need me for this?

22:05.951 --> 22:07.619
Not really.

22:07.703 --> 22:10.122
I usually do a little better
with some privacy.

22:11.957 --> 22:13.166
What're you gonna do?

22:14.793 --> 22:16.211
Somethin' for Miss Marie.

22:36.189 --> 22:38.358
<i>All units, a man just
walked into a petting zoo.</i>

22:38.817 --> 22:40.444
Dispatch, we are responding
to a bank robbery.

22:40.527 --> 22:43.155
- Who cares if some guy walks into...
<i>- Listen to me, Bill. It's T. C.</i>

23:38.502 --> 23:40.587
Welcome, Allfather.

23:47.469 --> 23:50.889
I wasn't expecting you.

23:53.558 --> 23:57.771
But we are honored
to have you here in New Orleans.

24:00.190 --> 24:02.609
Have you sampled the local cuisine?

24:04.277 --> 24:08.365
Perhaps, you find it
a little light for your liking?

24:08.782 --> 24:09.908
Not enough, um...

24:11.868 --> 24:13.036
Not enough sauces?

24:14.121 --> 24:17.040
Your head looks like a penis, Starr.

24:18.333 --> 24:19.417
Yes. I...

24:22.879 --> 24:24.131
Work injury.

24:27.676 --> 24:30.220
Do you know the symbol
for the Crusaders of Jerusalem?

24:30.720 --> 24:33.890
Um, sword? Lance, perhaps?

24:34.724 --> 24:36.017
His spurs.

24:36.393 --> 24:39.479
Of course. I knew it was something

24:40.105 --> 24:41.106
metal.

24:41.189 --> 24:44.442
The horse, you see,
was the greatest asset a knight had,

24:45.443 --> 24:47.737
the thing which he
entrusted his life with.

24:47.821 --> 24:51.533
So if his horse
ever stumbled and fell, well...

24:53.910 --> 24:56.538
That was a very sad day.

24:58.290 --> 24:59.583
I can imagine.

24:59.666 --> 25:04.588
The knight couldn't just shoot his steed
in the head and be done with it.

25:05.088 --> 25:07.215
That would lack the requisite ceremony.

25:08.842 --> 25:14.097
The noblest, most God-fearing Crusader

25:14.764 --> 25:19.144
had no choice but to eat his horse.

25:30.739 --> 25:33.366
We have
much to discuss, <i>Herr</i> Starr.

25:34.159 --> 25:35.327
But first

25:36.369 --> 25:37.412
we eat.

26:12.322 --> 26:13.406
See?

26:13.490 --> 26:15.492
Powers you didn't even know existed.

26:17.118 --> 26:18.286
There's... All right.

26:18.370 --> 26:19.871
There's other ways
of getting high, you know.

26:21.456 --> 26:22.457
Come on.

26:26.795 --> 26:27.921
Another ginger ale?

26:28.630 --> 26:29.798
Perhaps later.

26:29.881 --> 26:31.633
Yeah. Pace yourself.

26:33.802 --> 26:34.803
So, how do you get laid, man?

26:34.886 --> 26:37.305
You're like a weird,
more boring George Washington.

26:37.389 --> 26:38.390
I do all right.

26:38.473 --> 26:41.434
Oh, yeah, I forgot about your
"children," with the pretend teeth.

26:41.518 --> 26:42.686
Very sexy, indeed.

26:43.353 --> 26:44.354
I'll tell you what.

26:44.437 --> 26:46.356
Let me show you how it goes
in the real world, all right?

26:49.067 --> 26:50.652
Sorry. Sorry to bother you.

26:50.735 --> 26:52.862
I just saw you from across...

26:52.946 --> 26:55.365
All right, then.

26:56.992 --> 26:58.034
All right. It's a bad example.

26:58.118 --> 27:00.453
She's here with her dad. Let me just...

27:02.622 --> 27:03.748
Attractive woman,

27:04.708 --> 27:06.209
come to me.

27:10.588 --> 27:12.674
What! Oh, come on.

27:15.719 --> 27:17.220
No.

27:24.686 --> 27:26.521
All right. I'm impressed by it.

27:27.314 --> 27:30.025
I'm impressed by it, for Christ's sake.

27:32.319 --> 27:33.778
Oh, my God!

27:37.991 --> 27:39.326
- Pervert!
- What?

27:39.409 --> 27:41.161
- Come on, Dad.
- That's amazing!

27:41.911 --> 27:44.414
What about that? Invisibility.

27:44.497 --> 27:45.623
Unbelievable.

27:45.707 --> 27:50.295
Don't be foolish.
No one can turn invisible.

27:51.504 --> 27:52.672
That's bloody cool.

27:56.551 --> 27:59.179
Well, thank you very much
for a pleasant evening.

28:00.722 --> 28:02.182
Feel free to look me up again.

28:03.975 --> 28:05.018
All right.

28:09.272 --> 28:11.191
All right, all right. I give. I give.

28:13.026 --> 28:14.069
Sorry?

28:14.527 --> 28:16.029
All that in there,
with the powers and that...

28:16.112 --> 28:17.197
How were you doing that?

28:19.616 --> 28:23.787
Tonight, we accept another
into our inner sanctum...

28:25.497 --> 28:29.626
A blessing many covet, but few possess.

28:31.169 --> 28:32.295
Do you trust me?

28:33.046 --> 28:34.214
I do.

28:34.297 --> 28:36.674
Do you choose this freely?

28:37.342 --> 28:38.343
I do.

28:39.135 --> 28:40.929
Will you forsake the sunlit world

28:42.347 --> 28:45.767
and surrender to our dark
and scarlet urging?

28:46.434 --> 28:48.603
I do, my Lord. I will.

29:04.494 --> 29:07.122
Rise, my son.

29:12.877 --> 29:14.129
How do you feel?

29:14.963 --> 29:17.465
Awesome!

29:24.514 --> 29:25.974
My turn next, right?

29:27.725 --> 29:28.768
So, what did you think?

29:28.852 --> 29:31.980
What do I think?
That's your secret sauce?

29:32.313 --> 29:33.982
The blood of morons, mate?

29:34.065 --> 29:36.109
You're damning them so you can
just flit about in the sky

29:36.192 --> 29:37.861
and turn into a cat for laughs?

29:37.944 --> 29:39.988
I'm gonna tear
yer bleedin' head off, you...

29:55.336 --> 29:57.672
Did you feel damned
as you flew among the stars tonight?

29:57.755 --> 30:00.008
Look. Turning people, it's wrong.

30:00.091 --> 30:01.426
Trust me. I know about it.

30:01.509 --> 30:03.470
And this person that
you brought through or "turned,"

30:03.553 --> 30:05.722
as you put it, were they a good person?

30:05.805 --> 30:07.891
He was my son. All right?

30:07.974 --> 30:11.227
And was he a good person?

30:12.187 --> 30:13.771
All right.
Actually, he was a bit of a dick.

30:13.855 --> 30:14.898
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

30:14.981 --> 30:17.984
Each of the people that I select
is not only a willing participant,

30:18.067 --> 30:21.362
but a good person, willing to honor
and protect our traditions.

30:21.446 --> 30:23.281
All right, all right. You know what?

30:23.364 --> 30:25.658
Fair enough.
It's just not my cup of tea.

30:25.742 --> 30:27.243
I don't like it, all right?

30:28.536 --> 30:29.621
All right.

30:30.872 --> 30:32.207
No, don't go.

30:32.290 --> 30:33.458
There's more than
what you've seen so far.

30:33.541 --> 30:34.876
There's things
that I want to share with you.

30:34.959 --> 30:37.337
Why? Why do you need me?

30:37.420 --> 30:40.507
You've got this thing going on here,
and it's clearly working out for you.

30:40.590 --> 30:42.425
What do you need me for,
for Christ's sake?

30:42.509 --> 30:44.344
I was looking for a friend.

30:49.182 --> 30:50.225
Aren't you?

30:54.354 --> 30:55.897
No, I got enough friends, all right?

31:20.380 --> 31:21.506
Hurry up, Lil' Jesse.

31:26.469 --> 31:27.637
Here you go, Miss Marie.

31:28.513 --> 31:29.597
Here's your medicine.

31:30.390 --> 31:31.391
There's not many.

31:32.141 --> 31:35.144
It's enough for now. Keep you two alive.

31:35.520 --> 31:37.272
Here it is. Here it is. There you go.

31:40.275 --> 31:41.484
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

31:41.568 --> 31:42.569
Okay, come on.

31:44.112 --> 31:46.531
Okay, here's another one. Oh, yeah.

32:10.638 --> 32:12.849
<i>When I'm in my head</i>

32:14.559 --> 32:16.311
<i>Down on the ground</i>

32:18.021 --> 32:19.856
<i>I listen to</i>

32:21.107 --> 32:25.069
<i>The long droning sound
of sinners a-plenty</i>

32:25.153 --> 32:26.904
<i>Our pain runs deep</i>

32:28.740 --> 32:33.578
<i>Deeper than oceans, deeper than sleep</i>

32:45.923 --> 32:46.924
<i>Hello?</i>

32:48.217 --> 32:49.260
Cass?

32:50.762 --> 32:51.763
<i>Hi.</i>

32:52.722 --> 32:53.723
<i>Hi.</i>

32:54.515 --> 32:55.642
How are you?

32:56.309 --> 32:57.685
<i>I'm doin' all right, you know?</i>

32:58.603 --> 32:59.937
<i>Good. Well, that's good.</i>

33:00.355 --> 33:01.481
<i>Um...</i>

33:04.150 --> 33:06.027
How's New Orleans?

33:06.110 --> 33:07.737
New Orleans is New Orleans, you know?

33:07.820 --> 33:08.821
<i>Yeah.</i>

33:08.905 --> 33:09.906
Well...

33:11.324 --> 33:15.536
Man, it's been crazy here.
I mean, it's all kicked off.

33:16.287 --> 33:19.957
<i>We got in this big fight,
uh, with Jody and T. C.,</i>

33:20.041 --> 33:21.626
and, uh, it was huge.

33:21.709 --> 33:22.752
I mean, it was...

33:23.961 --> 33:26.756
<i>Well, anyway, I won, obviously.
No problem</i>.

33:27.507 --> 33:28.925
But Jesse, he, uh...

33:30.468 --> 33:33.596
He went and got himself
stuck in an underwater coffin.

33:33.930 --> 33:36.641
<i>He got out eventually, you know,
so don't worry.</i>

33:38.851 --> 33:39.894
<i>So, that's good.</i>

33:41.145 --> 33:42.355
I killed Gran'ma!

33:42.897 --> 33:45.525
<i>I mean, I really, actually did kill her.
I mean, she was dead.</i>

33:46.067 --> 33:47.193
<i>And then, she got better,</i>

33:47.694 --> 33:48.861
<i>unfortunately.</i>

33:50.154 --> 33:52.031
Mmm... What else?

33:54.659 --> 33:55.827
Cut my hair.

33:58.037 --> 34:01.958
<i>Oh, we robbed a bank with some spit.
Can you believe you can do that now?</i>

34:04.377 --> 34:05.461
So, yeah...

34:08.672 --> 34:09.799
Pretty crazy.

34:13.428 --> 34:17.681
- Are you still there, Cass?
<i>- Yeah. Yeah, I'm still here.</i>

34:17.764 --> 34:19.225
- Yeah.
<i>- What are you doing?</i>

34:19.726 --> 34:22.103
Lots of things, actually. Um...

34:23.103 --> 34:25.106
<i>- Yep.</i>
- You're in a crack house, aren't you?

34:25.188 --> 34:26.190
<i>No.</i>

34:27.150 --> 34:28.359
It's not a house.

34:30.527 --> 34:31.862
You know what?

34:31.946 --> 34:37.659
<i>You might be bored and lonely
and feeling sorry for your sorry ass,</i>

34:37.744 --> 34:40.036
but you've got to wise up
and cut the crap

34:40.121 --> 34:42.165
because when we get out of here,
which we will do,

34:42.706 --> 34:44.292
<i>me and Jesse, we're gonna come find you,</i>

34:44.375 --> 34:46.002
<i>and we're gonna
hit the road again, okay?</i>

34:46.085 --> 34:47.128
<i>So, you betterjust...</i>

34:47.503 --> 34:49.714
Just hang in there and stay alive, okay?

34:51.299 --> 34:52.300
<i>Tulip?</i>

34:53.092 --> 34:54.092
<i>Yeah?</i>

34:55.261 --> 34:58.055
I've been alive 119 years now.

34:59.474 --> 35:02.560
The you and Jesses of this world,
I've gone through thousands of 'em.

35:04.103 --> 35:05.897
<i>And I'll go through thousands more.</i>

35:08.524 --> 35:10.359
<i>I don't "hang in" for people.</i>

35:14.322 --> 35:15.448
I move on.

35:34.258 --> 35:35.259
Thank you.

35:36.385 --> 35:37.929
I'm glad you're feeling better.

35:38.596 --> 35:41.224
For your girl's sake, I'm sure you are.

35:43.017 --> 35:45.686
I mean, these two featherbrains

35:45.770 --> 35:49.607
have been tryin' to
bust into Sabina's bank for years,

35:49.690 --> 35:52.193
and they never got
past the teller booth.

35:52.318 --> 35:54.278
That's true.

35:57.448 --> 35:58.533
Tulip still on the phone?

36:01.619 --> 36:02.662
Nope.

36:03.496 --> 36:05.456
That girl of yours is clever.

36:05.790 --> 36:06.791
Yeah.

36:06.874 --> 36:11.087
About banks. In other things? Less so.

36:11.170 --> 36:13.881
- Like tryin' to kill Miss Marie.
- Mmm.

36:13.965 --> 36:15.132
Not so clever.

36:15.633 --> 36:17.301
Mmm-mmm.

36:17.385 --> 36:19.470
Mischief and mayhem, Jesse.

36:19.679 --> 36:23.015
Insolence since the day
you both arrived.

36:24.725 --> 36:26.143
I gave you what you wanted.

36:26.227 --> 36:28.354
No, you gave me what I needed.

36:29.105 --> 36:32.775
What I want is your debt paid.

36:33.109 --> 36:34.694
If you touch Tulip,

36:36.070 --> 36:38.531
I will not lift another finger for you.

36:39.115 --> 36:41.325
Except to wring your goddamn...

36:47.999 --> 36:49.166
Get her ready.

37:49.226 --> 37:50.978
What're we gonna do with her now?

37:53.940 --> 37:57.401
She's strong.
We'll fight her in the Tombs.

38:24.804 --> 38:26.973
Person ain't nothin' without their soul.

38:28.683 --> 38:29.892
I will pay your debt.

38:30.810 --> 38:32.269
I will get you what you want.

38:33.813 --> 38:34.981
But not like this.

38:38.109 --> 38:39.568
It's time to call the Grail.

38:49.245 --> 38:51.163
Did you enjoy your hindquarters?

38:52.289 --> 38:55.084
Very much, <i>Monsieur</i>. Thank you.

39:19.191 --> 39:20.860
The Apocalypse approaches.

39:21.694 --> 39:24.030
Looking forward to it, Allfather.

39:24.613 --> 39:28.659
On our command, the world governments
will loose their nuclear arsenals,

39:28.743 --> 39:30.661
and the world will be made anew.

39:31.746 --> 39:32.788
Nuclear?

39:33.164 --> 39:34.290
End of the world.

39:36.417 --> 39:37.501
As ordained.

39:38.002 --> 39:39.045
I...

39:39.420 --> 39:42.965
I thought that meant a run on the banks.

39:43.507 --> 39:47.636
Only fire can separate
the True Believer from the False.

39:47.720 --> 39:51.724
Only fire can pave the way for our Lord.

39:52.808 --> 39:54.435
Jesus Christ.

39:55.061 --> 39:56.103
Exactly.

39:59.148 --> 40:01.609
Are you a True Believer, Starr?

40:02.109 --> 40:03.402
Of course, I am.

40:04.737 --> 40:05.905
Are you, though?

40:07.823 --> 40:13.579
I serve the Holy Child
and his tap-dancing majesty.

40:20.419 --> 40:21.420
Good.

40:27.343 --> 40:30.096
Then, let's talk about Jesse Custer.

40:50.199 --> 40:51.408
Hey, Mrs. Rosen.

40:51.617 --> 40:54.328
Mr. Cassidy. You came back!

40:54.411 --> 40:57.498
Oh, my goodness.
Everyone will be thrilled.

40:57.581 --> 40:58.707
Mmm.

40:59.500 --> 41:01.836
Are you okay? You look poorly.

41:01.919 --> 41:04.839
Oh. I've been smoking crack all day.

41:06.090 --> 41:10.052
Dear, that's no good for you.
Come inside.

41:10.427 --> 41:15.808
- I'm making blondies!
- Oh! Thank you.

41:18.227 --> 41:19.562
Yoo-hoo!

41:19.645 --> 41:23.149
Everyone! Look who's home!
