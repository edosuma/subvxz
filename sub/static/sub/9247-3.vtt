WEBVTT

00:04.265 --> 00:05.701
[Molly]
'Oh, my God.'

00:05.788 --> 00:07.050
Every one
of these wedding pictures

00:07.137 --> 00:08.747
is worse than the last.

00:08.834 --> 00:11.576
'There's Mike
with his mouth open'

00:11.663 --> 00:13.317
'Mike with eyes closed'

00:13.404 --> 00:15.493
mouth open and eyes closed.

00:15.580 --> 00:17.452
Oh, here's one
with everything open

00:17.539 --> 00:19.193
mouth, eyes and fly.

00:21.282 --> 00:22.805
Our entire wedding,
it looks like

00:22.892 --> 00:25.677
he should be hanging
from the end of a fish hook.

00:25.764 --> 00:27.636
Well, it is pretty lifelike.

00:27.723 --> 00:29.203
I, I mean, he does have
his mouth open

00:29.290 --> 00:32.728
and his eyes closed
most of the time, so..

00:32.815 --> 00:34.512
Sometimes I like
to toss popcorn

00:34.599 --> 00:37.124
into that gaping hole..

00:37.211 --> 00:39.169
...like littering
in the Grand Canyon.

00:42.042 --> 00:44.261
Oh, he's smiling in this one!

00:44.348 --> 00:45.958
Maybe I can Photoshop my head

00:46.046 --> 00:47.830
on to the woman serving him
garlic mashed potatoes.

00:47.917 --> 00:50.093
Ah! Good idea.

00:50.180 --> 00:53.836
Certainly looks like
he's in love with her.

00:53.923 --> 00:55.794
Hey, what are you guys doing?

00:58.362 --> 01:00.582
I'm looking
at the wedding picture.

01:00.669 --> 01:02.671
Where did you get that cake?

01:04.934 --> 01:06.414
Found it.

01:09.025 --> 01:11.114
Is that our wedding cake
from the freezer?

01:12.811 --> 01:14.552
Maybe.

01:14.639 --> 01:15.727
Mike, we're supposed
to save that

01:15.814 --> 01:17.686
to eat on our first anniversary.

01:17.773 --> 01:19.209
Oh, is that why
you had it barricaded

01:19.296 --> 01:20.993
behind those ice trays
and that bag of peas

01:21.081 --> 01:23.648
'cause I almost didn't find it.

01:23.735 --> 01:25.781
- Put it back!
- It's just a little sliver.

01:25.868 --> 01:27.696
And I only got one piece
at the wedding!

01:27.783 --> 01:30.438
Really? Is that the story
you're sticking to?

01:32.962 --> 01:35.486
- Maybe.
- Okay.

01:35.573 --> 01:37.271
Oh, the first piece was consumed

01:37.358 --> 01:40.100
while the entree
was being brought out. No.

01:40.187 --> 01:42.102
The second,
was hiding behind the drummer

01:42.189 --> 01:45.105
while the band played
"Hokey Pokey."

01:45.192 --> 01:47.542
Ah, who's that sneaking
Carl's piece

01:47.629 --> 01:50.153
while he gives
his touching best man's toast?

01:50.240 --> 01:51.633
Well, that speech
went on forever.

01:51.720 --> 01:53.243
What'd you want me to do,
starve to death?

01:53.330 --> 01:54.940
- Mike!
- Fine!

01:55.027 --> 01:58.379
I didn't trust that photographer
the minute I met him.

01:58.466 --> 02:00.685
Hey, it didn't stop you
from eating his cake!

02:02.252 --> 02:07.649
♪ For the first time
in my life ♪

02:07.736 --> 02:11.131
♪ I see love ♪♪

02:24.405 --> 02:27.973
I mean, who saves cake
for a year?

02:28.060 --> 02:31.368
Certainly nobody
that lives with you.

02:31.455 --> 02:34.502
You're like one of those
drug-sniffing dogs..

02:34.589 --> 02:37.287
...except with donut holes
and Ding Dongs.

02:37.374 --> 02:38.593
You could smell a candy wrapper

02:38.680 --> 02:41.987
and find a little kid in a well.

02:42.074 --> 02:43.424
Apparently, if you eat the cake
a year later

02:43.511 --> 02:44.903
it's supposed
to bring you luck.

02:44.990 --> 02:46.340
Well, if eating cake
brought somebody luck

02:46.427 --> 02:47.515
y-you should've a pot of gold

02:47.602 --> 02:50.039
i-instead of a pot of belly.

02:50.126 --> 02:52.737
I only had a couple of bites
and now I'm back on my diet.

02:52.824 --> 02:54.696
Alright, well, stay on it
because if things go as planned

02:54.783 --> 02:56.350
you're gonna need to squeeze
into another tuxedo.

02:56.437 --> 02:57.612
Carl, I've told you before

02:57.699 --> 02:58.656
I am not joining

02:58.743 --> 03:01.616
your O'Jays Tribute Band.

03:01.703 --> 03:03.531
This ain't about "Love Train."

03:03.618 --> 03:05.010
This is about you being
the best man at my wedding.

03:05.097 --> 03:06.011
Your wedding?

03:06.098 --> 03:07.056
I thought Christina told you

03:07.143 --> 03:08.188
she wanted to take it slow.

03:08.275 --> 03:09.885
Uh, she does, but she also said

03:09.972 --> 03:11.843
wearing tube socks in bed
wasn't sexy.

03:11.930 --> 03:14.019
And she's starting
to change her tune on that one.

03:16.283 --> 03:18.285
I see what you're doing,
you're speeding things up

03:18.372 --> 03:19.634
so she doesn't have time
to think

03:19.721 --> 03:20.678
about how much better
she could do.

03:20.765 --> 03:22.637
Exactly, when it comes to women

03:22.724 --> 03:24.769
thinkin' time has never worked
in my favor.

03:28.643 --> 03:31.167
Thank you for editing
our wedding video for us.

03:31.254 --> 03:34.039
My pleasure. I'm actually
kind of a film buff.

03:34.126 --> 03:36.172
My major influences,
other than Bergman, of course--

03:36.259 --> 03:39.871
Right, right. Why-why don't you
just show me what you got?

03:39.958 --> 03:43.745
Oh. Now, bear in mind,
this is just a rough edit.

03:43.832 --> 03:45.094
[instrumental music]

03:45.181 --> 03:47.270
Oh..

03:47.357 --> 03:49.794
[Harry on computer]
'In a church in a neighborhood
far, far away'

03:49.881 --> 03:51.840
'two stars collide in an orbit'

03:51.927 --> 03:54.321
'filled with friends
and family.'

03:55.713 --> 03:57.193
Did you narrate the whole thing?

03:57.280 --> 04:00.022
God, no. Voice-over is a crutch.

04:00.109 --> 04:02.851
I just added it to cover
some of the slow spots.

04:02.938 --> 04:05.984
Warning, there are
a lot of slow spots.

04:06.942 --> 04:08.770
Slow spots?

04:08.857 --> 04:10.511
The day practically flew by!

04:10.598 --> 04:14.123
That wasn't
the scuttlebutt in my pew.

04:14.210 --> 04:16.691
Uh, by the way, Mike's vows were
a little muffled

04:16.778 --> 04:18.301
so I had to loop his dialogue.

04:18.388 --> 04:20.085
What do you mean, loop it?

04:20.172 --> 04:22.653
- 'Molly Flynn.'
- Oh, God.

04:22.740 --> 04:24.742
[Mike on computer]
'I love you,
and every moment of my life'

04:24.829 --> 04:27.092
'has meaning because I do.'

04:27.179 --> 04:30.182
I think my reading
was a little more heartfelt.

04:30.270 --> 04:33.142
Just skip ahead
to the reception.

04:33.229 --> 04:35.666
[instrumental music]

04:35.753 --> 04:39.279
Alright. Sound quality's good.

04:39.366 --> 04:41.411
Nicely paced.

04:41.498 --> 04:44.588
Wait, what are all the shots
of my sister's cleavage?

04:44.675 --> 04:46.808
What can I say?
The camera just loves her.

04:46.895 --> 04:48.200
No, you just love her!

04:48.288 --> 04:50.290
Did you happen to get
any footage of her face?

04:50.377 --> 04:52.727
You can actually catch
a little reflection

04:52.814 --> 04:54.685
in her wine glass.

04:54.772 --> 04:57.645
Very "Citizen Kane," you know,
with the snow globe.

04:57.732 --> 05:00.517
Yeah, except
your snow globes have nipples.

05:00.604 --> 05:03.477
I have people coming
to my house tonight to see this

05:03.564 --> 05:05.261
and it's nowhere near done!

05:05.348 --> 05:06.480
So call your mother and tell her

05:06.567 --> 05:08.308
you won't be home for dinner.

05:08.395 --> 05:11.615
- It's goulashnight--
- Sit!

05:11.702 --> 05:13.922
You're not leaving
until you've captured the magic

05:14.009 --> 05:15.489
that was my wedding.

05:15.576 --> 05:18.013
And how about a shot or two
of the bride, huh?

05:18.100 --> 05:20.972
I mean, this is your money
right here, comprende?

05:21.059 --> 05:23.584
Comprende.

05:23.671 --> 05:26.282
What am I gonna do when your
class gets back from recess?

05:26.369 --> 05:27.762
Tell 'em you're a big, dumb kid

05:27.849 --> 05:29.416
that was held back for 20 years.

05:29.503 --> 05:31.026
They'll believe it.

05:36.901 --> 05:38.033
It was nice of you
to bring lunch

05:38.120 --> 05:39.687
to Christina, very thoughtful.

05:39.774 --> 05:41.515
Well, it's little gestures
like this

05:41.602 --> 05:43.081
that score big points
with a woman.

05:43.168 --> 05:46.650
See, nothing says L-U-V
like a B-L-T.

05:46.737 --> 05:47.956
That's how you won my heart.

05:48.043 --> 05:50.959
[laughs]

05:51.046 --> 05:54.136
[Mike]
Hey, that guy looks familiar.
Excuse me.

05:54.223 --> 05:56.791
Did you used to play football
for the U of I?

05:56.878 --> 05:59.533
A long time ago. James Turner.

05:59.620 --> 06:02.666
James Turner,
best hands in the Big Ten!

06:02.753 --> 06:04.842
Hey, I was heartbroken
when you blew your knee out.

06:04.929 --> 06:08.106
Yeah, that wasn't a good day
for me, either.

06:08.193 --> 06:09.456
I saw him play against Michigan.

06:09.543 --> 06:10.587
He made a one-handed catch

06:10.674 --> 06:11.632
in the back of the end zone.

06:11.719 --> 06:12.981
It still gives me chills.

06:13.068 --> 06:15.636
James Turner?
Yeah, I heard of him.

06:15.723 --> 06:18.552
So, uh, what are you up to?
Sportscaster, astronaut?

06:18.639 --> 06:19.901
If it's astronaut,
I got to admit

06:19.988 --> 06:22.686
I don't really follow that.

06:22.773 --> 06:24.732
- Actually, I'm a lawyer now.
- Of course, you are.

06:24.819 --> 06:26.386
A guy like you
could do anything.

06:26.473 --> 06:27.778
He's not like you and me, Carl.

06:27.865 --> 06:29.258
God gave this man two scoops.

06:29.345 --> 06:31.521
[laughs]

06:31.608 --> 06:33.654
Uh, Carl,
what are you doing here?

06:33.741 --> 06:36.091
Uh, just dropping off
a yummy lunch for my honeybunch.

06:36.178 --> 06:37.440
I..

06:37.527 --> 06:38.659
Actually, uh

06:38.746 --> 06:41.009
I'm going out to lunch
with James

06:41.096 --> 06:42.532
my ex-husband.

06:45.056 --> 06:48.233
Oh. This is your James.

06:48.320 --> 06:50.235
That's where
I heard that name before.

06:51.715 --> 06:53.325
What's happenin', man?

06:57.242 --> 06:59.331
Oh, my God,
you divorced James Turner?

06:59.419 --> 07:01.377
How high is your bar, lady?

07:03.379 --> 07:04.946
[Christina]
'He came in town last minute.'

07:05.033 --> 07:07.122
We're gonna go have lunch
and talk about James Junior.

07:07.209 --> 07:10.125
Right. James Junior.
That's a good kid.

07:10.212 --> 07:12.257
He likes to sit on my back
while I'm doing push-ups.

07:15.826 --> 07:18.655
I hate to ask, but, uh,
could I get a picture?

07:18.742 --> 07:19.874
Yeah, of course.

07:19.961 --> 07:21.615
Don't take it from a low angle.

07:21.702 --> 07:23.138
I'm feeling
a little jowly today.

07:23.225 --> 07:25.488
- I retain water.
- You retain ham.

07:25.575 --> 07:28.970
- Just take the picture.
- Alright, there's your picture.

07:29.057 --> 07:30.493
We gotta get back
on the streets.

07:30.580 --> 07:33.888
When we put on a uniform,
we're not playing games.

07:33.975 --> 07:35.585
We're saving lives.

07:40.851 --> 07:43.071
So you're in town
for a couple of days?

07:43.158 --> 07:44.899
Do you bowl?

07:44.986 --> 07:47.162
- 'Mike!'
- I gotta go. That's my ride.

07:47.249 --> 07:48.424
Okay.

07:51.340 --> 07:53.385
I'll probably end up
sharing it with a homeless guy.

07:59.174 --> 08:00.262
You know,
a lot of times when you meet

08:00.349 --> 08:01.611
those superstar athletes

08:01.698 --> 08:02.699
they can be a little stuck up

08:02.786 --> 08:04.222
not James Turner.

08:04.309 --> 08:06.790
Class act!

08:06.877 --> 08:08.531
He's kind of full of himself,
if you ask me.

08:08.618 --> 08:10.272
Why wouldn't he be?
Smart, handsome.

08:10.359 --> 08:12.317
And did you see his body?

08:12.404 --> 08:15.016
I'm not gay, but that's one guy
who could flip me.

08:16.496 --> 08:18.454
I hope he has a big-ass spatula.

08:19.934 --> 08:21.326
Hey, do you think
it's a little odd

08:21.413 --> 08:22.545
she didn't mention
he was in town

08:22.632 --> 08:23.764
or that she was having lunch
with him?

08:23.851 --> 08:25.287
Well, she said
it was a last-minute thing

08:25.374 --> 08:27.028
plus, when you're having lunch
with Superman

08:27.115 --> 08:29.857
you're not gonna rub it
in Jughead's face.

08:29.944 --> 08:31.293
Hey, that guy ain't no big deal!

08:31.380 --> 08:32.599
Yeah, he played
some college football

08:32.686 --> 08:35.427
got a little law degree.
Whoop-dee-doo!

08:35.515 --> 08:37.647
Spoken like somebody
who never saw him play.

08:37.734 --> 08:39.562
I'm telling you,
that man had angel wings

08:39.649 --> 08:41.912
on that broad, muscly back!

08:43.087 --> 08:44.741
Again, not gay

08:44.828 --> 08:46.787
but I see
how a guy could get there.

08:51.139 --> 08:53.445
Whoa, that is a great picture.

08:53.533 --> 08:55.839
And James is not just
handsome and athletic

08:55.926 --> 08:58.886
he's smart and charming
and very personable.

09:00.235 --> 09:02.019
That is a rare combination.

09:02.106 --> 09:04.935
Trust me, there's only
a few of us out there.

09:05.022 --> 09:07.198
Yeah, but he's a lawyer, and you
know what those guys are like.

09:07.285 --> 09:09.418
You mean rich?
Look at that suit.

09:09.505 --> 09:12.421
I'm guessing
it cost more than your car.

09:12.508 --> 09:13.944
And I don't know what kind
of cologne he was wearing

09:14.031 --> 09:15.729
but it was intoxicating.

09:15.816 --> 09:18.645
Musky, but not overbearing.

09:18.732 --> 09:21.169
Harry's parking, so everybody
get your meat in the seats.

09:21.256 --> 09:23.737
It's showtime.
Where's Christina?

09:23.824 --> 09:25.173
I don't know where she is
or what she's doing.

09:25.260 --> 09:27.871
Honestly, I don't even
know that woman anymore.

09:27.958 --> 09:30.308
So what I'm hearing is,
we can start without her.

09:30.395 --> 09:32.223
[knocking on door]

09:34.574 --> 09:35.487
Where have you been?

09:35.575 --> 09:37.011
Sorry, but time really flies

09:37.098 --> 09:39.491
when you're destroying
a masterpiece.

09:39.579 --> 09:42.669
Just start the DVD.
Mom, Victoria, showtime!

09:42.756 --> 09:44.322
You know, if I'm gonna
sit through this wedding again

09:44.409 --> 09:46.281
I'm gonna need
a couple of pops of Hooch.

09:46.368 --> 09:49.632
Way ahead of you.
Tequilashooters for everybody.

09:49.719 --> 09:51.373
We can make a drinking game
out of it

09:51.460 --> 09:53.505
like every time we see Mike
having a piece of cake

09:53.593 --> 09:55.812
we all do a shot.

09:55.899 --> 09:58.772
We are gonna get so hammered.

09:58.859 --> 10:00.730
Alright, welcome, all

10:00.817 --> 10:03.428
to the world premiere
of Mike and Molly's Wedding.

10:03.515 --> 10:06.431
[chuckles]
Um..

10:06.518 --> 10:08.825
Everyone please put
your cell phones to vibrate

10:08.912 --> 10:10.610
keep your chitchat to a minimum

10:10.697 --> 10:13.438
and just prepare
to relive the magic.

10:14.701 --> 10:16.093
Press play, Harry.

10:16.180 --> 10:19.009
[instrumental music]

10:19.096 --> 10:20.489
Your best scenes were cut

10:20.576 --> 10:22.099
but if you'd like
a private showing

10:22.186 --> 10:23.666
that could be arranged.

10:25.015 --> 10:27.191
Would you mind
sitting somewhere else?

10:29.019 --> 10:31.282
- Closer or further away?
- Shh!

10:32.457 --> 10:34.329
Oh, Christina sends her best

10:34.416 --> 10:35.591
but apparently,
she can't make it.

10:35.678 --> 10:37.593
Oh! Mike's eating cake.

10:40.857 --> 10:42.598
How did you get cake
before the ceremony?

10:42.685 --> 10:44.382
It wasn't cake,
it was a cinnamon roll.

10:44.469 --> 10:47.124
You were late and
my blood sugar was plummeting.

10:47.211 --> 10:49.431
How could that be?
Your blood is nothing but sugar.

10:51.172 --> 10:53.391
She doesn't say why,
she just says she can't make it.

10:53.478 --> 10:55.567
Alright, he's chewing something.
I missed it. Was that cake?

10:55.655 --> 10:58.309
Looks like
either a Chiclet or a Rolo.

10:58.396 --> 11:00.790
Can we just say that whenever
he puts anything in his mouth

11:00.877 --> 11:02.400
we get to drink?

11:02.487 --> 11:03.880
I don't think
we have enough tequila.

11:03.967 --> 11:06.666
I don't think Mexico
has enough tequila.

11:06.753 --> 11:08.755
Look at Christina,
you know, walking down the aisle

11:08.842 --> 11:10.931
right after she told me
she loved me.

11:11.018 --> 11:13.498
I guess those words
don't mean anything

11:13.585 --> 11:16.632
just something you say to a man
who's handing you his heart!

11:16.719 --> 11:19.461
Oh, you sweet angel.

11:19.548 --> 11:22.638
You sweet, lying,
deceiving angel!

11:25.728 --> 11:27.817
'Christina!'

11:27.904 --> 11:29.776
[sobbing]
'Christina!'

11:29.863 --> 11:32.735
[Carl sobbing]

11:32.822 --> 11:34.084
Tootsie Roll!

11:41.918 --> 11:44.181
[instrumental music]

11:47.924 --> 11:50.753
Anybody say anything
after I left last night?

11:50.840 --> 11:52.494
You mean, after you walked out
of the living room

11:52.581 --> 11:53.713
and were crying in the kitchen

11:53.800 --> 11:54.888
or after you walked out
of the kitchen

11:54.975 --> 11:56.890
and were crying on the porch?

11:59.283 --> 12:00.458
Porch.

12:02.286 --> 12:05.072
I heard all the kitchen stuff.

12:05.159 --> 12:06.943
Yeah, by then
everybody was pretty soused

12:07.030 --> 12:09.163
from the "Drink when
Mike eats cake" game.

12:10.512 --> 12:12.862
You know, I may have a problem.

12:12.949 --> 12:14.255
Well, just so you know

12:14.342 --> 12:16.300
last night
wasn't all about Christina.

12:16.387 --> 12:17.867
I always get weepy at weddings

12:17.954 --> 12:20.130
and dog shows for some reason.

12:20.217 --> 12:23.438
It's a shame
they can't all be winners.

12:23.525 --> 12:26.223
I know,
you're a very sensitive man.

12:26.310 --> 12:27.834
And I'm sure
Christina had a good reason

12:27.921 --> 12:28.922
for not showing up.

12:29.009 --> 12:30.488
Yeah. Well, she's a busy woman.

12:30.575 --> 12:32.012
She's got a career and a kid.

12:32.099 --> 12:33.143
I can't expect her
to drop everything

12:33.230 --> 12:34.275
and be at my beck and call.

12:34.362 --> 12:36.103
Very mature way
to think about it.

12:36.190 --> 12:38.279
I'm a mature man and this
is an adult relationship

12:38.366 --> 12:39.846
built on a foundation of trust.

12:39.933 --> 12:41.804
Without trust, you got nothing.

12:41.891 --> 12:43.023
Uh-huh.

12:43.110 --> 12:44.024
So does that mean we can stop

12:44.111 --> 12:46.330
circling her block?

12:46.417 --> 12:48.550
Hm, just a couple of more times.

12:53.903 --> 12:55.992
You're gonna be fine, Carl.
Just get some rest.

12:56.079 --> 12:57.994
And try not to do
anything stupid.

12:58.081 --> 12:59.256
Is he alright?

12:59.343 --> 13:02.042
Oh, no, he's gonna do
something stupid.

13:02.129 --> 13:03.391
Well, I hope
they're gonna be okay.

13:03.478 --> 13:05.349
- I really like Christina.
- Me, too.

13:05.436 --> 13:08.309
This is the first girl he ever
dated I wasn't scared of.

13:08.396 --> 13:10.180
There was this one
with an eye patch.

13:10.267 --> 13:12.704
She drove a school bus.

13:12.792 --> 13:14.794
School bus?
I think I've seen her.

13:15.707 --> 13:17.187
I hope it was her.

13:17.274 --> 13:19.233
I'd hate to think there's
two crazy one-eyed ladies

13:19.320 --> 13:21.496
carting kids around town.

13:21.583 --> 13:23.237
Oh, well, that job
doesn't always draw

13:23.324 --> 13:24.194
the cream of the crop.

13:24.281 --> 13:25.456
No.

13:28.982 --> 13:30.548
Sweetie, could I
ask you a question?

13:30.635 --> 13:32.507
- Sure.
- You and I are good, right?

13:32.594 --> 13:34.596
Our relationship's
pretty solid.

13:34.683 --> 13:36.293
Is this about that
bride of cake-enstein crack

13:36.380 --> 13:37.294
I made last night?

13:37.381 --> 13:38.295
'Cause I had had, like

13:38.382 --> 13:40.907
five shots of tequila.

13:40.994 --> 13:42.909
No, that was funny
and way more clever

13:42.996 --> 13:44.649
than your mom
just pointing at me and yelling

13:44.736 --> 13:46.521
"Tubby like cake!"

13:48.436 --> 13:49.916
Well, she's a mean drunk.

13:50.003 --> 13:51.961
She's a mean sober.

13:54.007 --> 13:55.617
Don't worry,
you and I are more than good.

13:55.704 --> 13:56.792
We're great.

13:56.879 --> 13:58.141
Well, I know I'm the perfect man

13:58.228 --> 13:59.316
in your eyes right now

13:59.403 --> 14:01.362
but it might not always
be that way.

14:02.145 --> 14:03.364
Sure.

14:03.451 --> 14:05.540
I mean,
I can't always expect you

14:05.627 --> 14:09.326
to maintain
this level of excellence.

14:09.413 --> 14:13.591
Right, I mean, if Christina
could get tired of James Turner

14:13.678 --> 14:15.724
you might actually
grow tired of me one day.

14:15.811 --> 14:17.682
You've got to be kidding me.

14:17.769 --> 14:20.772
- He's an Adonis, right?
- Not him, you!

14:20.860 --> 14:23.384
This is the best picture of you
I've ever seen.

14:23.471 --> 14:27.040
Your eyes are open,
Mike, you're smiling

14:27.127 --> 14:29.085
and you're practically glowing.

14:31.087 --> 14:33.568
What can I say? It was
a very special day for me.

14:37.964 --> 14:39.487
Unlike our wedding,
where every picture

14:39.574 --> 14:42.620
it looks like
you just got hit by lightning.

14:42.707 --> 14:44.927
Well, those pictures
may not have turned out great

14:45.014 --> 14:49.062
but the ones
I carry in my heart

14:49.149 --> 14:50.977
are absolutely perfect.

14:51.064 --> 14:53.501
I'm surrounded
by the people I love

14:53.588 --> 14:54.676
and I'm marrying

14:54.763 --> 14:57.200
the beautiful woman
of my dreams.

15:00.029 --> 15:02.814
You are one smooth talking
son of a bitch.

15:04.120 --> 15:05.992
Shut up and kiss me.

15:09.299 --> 15:11.388
Yeah, Christina, yeah, I'm gonna
need you to call me back

15:11.475 --> 15:12.868
'cause I'm tired
of this guessing game.

15:12.955 --> 15:14.130
I mean, if you're done with me,
that's fine

15:14.217 --> 15:15.653
but I need to know
so I can move on

15:15.740 --> 15:18.526
and I will move on!

15:18.613 --> 15:19.701
Oh, who am I kidding?
Just call me back!

15:19.788 --> 15:21.659
I'm making a fool of myself!

15:23.183 --> 15:26.664
Carlton, it is 11:05 in the p.m.

15:26.751 --> 15:29.232
Why aren't you in bed
diddling yourself?

15:31.539 --> 15:32.714
Why don't you just
go back to sleep, grandma?

15:32.801 --> 15:33.671
I got this under control.

15:33.758 --> 15:35.064
How am I supposed to sleep

15:35.151 --> 15:36.805
with you down here
wailing like a little girl

15:36.892 --> 15:39.851
sitting on a bumblebee?

15:39.939 --> 15:42.245
But why can't you be deaf
like other old ladies?

15:43.986 --> 15:46.336
Carlton, the woman
is clearly trying

15:46.423 --> 15:48.251
to put a little space
between you.

15:48.338 --> 15:49.818
And the more you push it

15:49.905 --> 15:51.602
the more you're gonna
push her away.

15:51.689 --> 15:54.083
Yeah, but if I don't push it,
I might lose her, grandma.

15:54.170 --> 15:57.565
It's clear, the woman is trying
to let you down easy.

15:57.652 --> 16:00.089
Oh, I see, just 'cause she
didn't return a few calls--

16:00.176 --> 16:02.962
Fifteen, and that's just since
you walked in the house

16:03.049 --> 16:05.355
plus, five on the porch
and two in your car.

16:05.442 --> 16:07.314
I wish I was deaf!

16:10.143 --> 16:11.883
You know what,
I'm going to her place right now

16:11.971 --> 16:12.928
and prove you wrong.

16:13.015 --> 16:14.495
Because you're wrong, grandma.

16:14.582 --> 16:16.714
Uh-huh, just like the time
when you were five

16:16.801 --> 16:18.499
and said you could stop
the electric fan

16:18.586 --> 16:21.241
with your tongue. Yeah.

16:21.328 --> 16:23.330
And I would've done it, too,
if you hadn't have stopped me!

16:23.417 --> 16:24.984
If I hadn't stopped you

16:25.071 --> 16:26.855
we wouldn't be having
this conversation

16:26.942 --> 16:28.639
because one of us
wouldn't have a tongue

16:28.726 --> 16:30.902
and the other one
would be in the bed asleep!

16:36.952 --> 16:38.693
[knocking on door]

16:38.780 --> 16:40.825
I hope
everything's gonna be fine.

16:42.653 --> 16:45.482
Carl, what are you doing here?

16:45.569 --> 16:47.441
I just wanted to make sure
you're okay.

16:47.528 --> 16:48.616
Left you a couple of messages.

16:48.703 --> 16:50.096
I know.

16:50.183 --> 16:52.011
I haven't had time
to listen to them all.

16:53.447 --> 16:56.015
Oh, so you did get them. Good.

16:56.102 --> 16:57.581
I was worried
your cell phone got stolen.

16:57.668 --> 16:58.887
You know, this neighborhood
is kind of sketchy

16:58.974 --> 17:00.149
that's why you might have seen
a patrol car

17:00.236 --> 17:02.195
circling your block earlier.

17:03.587 --> 17:05.024
Carl, I wanna talk to you

17:05.111 --> 17:06.547
but now is not the right time.

17:06.634 --> 17:08.897
Look, I just need to know
what's going on.

17:08.984 --> 17:10.638
I honestly don't know right now.

17:10.725 --> 17:12.379
[door opens]

17:12.466 --> 17:14.555
Everything okay?

17:14.642 --> 17:16.035
Oh, hey, Carl.

17:17.819 --> 17:19.864
Hey.

17:19.951 --> 17:22.476
James, can you give us a minute?

17:22.563 --> 17:23.738
Sure.

17:26.393 --> 17:28.569
Carl, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to hurt you.

17:28.656 --> 17:30.832
No, no. It'll take a lot more
than that to hurt me.

17:30.919 --> 17:32.094
You see, I had a woman
try to run me over

17:32.181 --> 17:34.836
with a school bus.

17:34.923 --> 17:37.752
I just, I just need
to see this through

17:37.839 --> 17:39.188
for myself, for my son.

17:39.275 --> 17:40.233
No, it's better
that it happened now

17:40.320 --> 17:41.408
than after we get married

17:41.495 --> 17:44.019
then I got to give you
half my crap.

17:44.106 --> 17:46.326
I still care about you
very much, Carl.

17:49.720 --> 17:51.287
I don't believe you.

18:00.253 --> 18:02.211
[instrumental music]

18:02.298 --> 18:05.040
You know what, man?
I'm better off!

18:05.127 --> 18:07.608
That relationship had an
expiration date on it, anyway.

18:07.695 --> 18:09.784
What are you talking about?
You loved Christina.

18:09.871 --> 18:11.612
Mike.

18:11.699 --> 18:13.309
See, I've loved a lot of women.

18:13.396 --> 18:15.485
Yeah, a man like me can't
limit himself to just one.

18:15.572 --> 18:17.792
It-it's like you and corn dogs

18:17.879 --> 18:19.489
or cupcakes or Fritos.

18:19.576 --> 18:21.143
I get it.

18:21.230 --> 18:23.363
And I'm not ready to be
anybody's daddy, either.

18:23.450 --> 18:25.234
That woman had a lot of baggage,
and frankly

18:25.321 --> 18:27.541
my arms were getting
pretty tired of carrying it.

18:27.628 --> 18:29.020
Well, you seem to be okay
with all of this

18:29.108 --> 18:30.326
so I guess I'm happy for you.

18:30.413 --> 18:31.762
Uh, jealous
is what you're gonna be

18:31.849 --> 18:33.547
because this dog
has been released from his cage

18:33.634 --> 18:35.592
and is back on the prowl!

18:35.679 --> 18:37.507
But don't worry, I'm gonna share
my tales of glory

18:37.594 --> 18:39.596
with all you boys
still in the kennel.

18:39.683 --> 18:41.163
Just the headlines, though,
I don't need

18:41.250 --> 18:43.165
to see or smell anything.

18:43.861 --> 18:45.515
Noted.

18:45.602 --> 18:47.735
Uh, there's only one thing I
can't quite wrap my head around.

18:47.822 --> 18:49.389
What's that?

18:49.476 --> 18:50.825
[sobbing]
Why couldn't she love me?

18:50.912 --> 18:52.218
Okay, take it easy.

18:52.305 --> 18:53.306
[sobbing]
Why couldn't she love me?

18:53.393 --> 18:54.307
Pull the car over.

18:54.394 --> 18:56.047
Pull the car over.

19:02.315 --> 19:04.534
[theme music]
