00:00.935 --> 00:02.134
     Good evening, Major Healey.

00:02.136 --> 00:03.235
Hi, Jeannie.
 Very good.

00:03.237 --> 00:05.170
Where's Tony?
    Tony!

00:05.172 --> 00:08.406
I have not seen Major Nelson
since early this morning.

00:08.408 --> 00:10.375
       Well, that's not like him
              to be late.

00:10.377 --> 00:12.277
   We got a dinner date tonight,
          and I'm starved.

00:12.279 --> 00:13.512
Well, I do not understand it.

00:13.514 --> 00:16.014
He has never been this late
without calling me before.

00:16.015 --> 00:17.048
                      Mm.

00:17.050 --> 00:18.517
           You're a little slow.

00:18.519 --> 00:19.518
                     You know,

00:19.520 --> 00:21.186
                 something funny
                   is going on.

00:21.188 --> 00:23.021
  Hm, something funny?

00:23.023 --> 00:24.589
                No, not that--
             That kind of funny.

00:24.591 --> 00:26.358
             He's been in
     a secret conference all day

00:26.360 --> 00:27.925
          with a lot of senators
               and generals.

00:27.927 --> 00:29.894
And he did not tell you
what it was all about?

00:29.896 --> 00:32.130
        Mm-mm. And I haven't had
         a chance to get to him.

00:32.131 --> 00:33.231
   Oh, well, you--

00:33.233 --> 00:35.033
     You do not think
anything is wrong, do you?

00:35.035 --> 00:36.134
        No, what could go wrong?

00:36.136 --> 00:37.835
             The only thing that
            puzzles me is that--

00:37.837 --> 00:38.870
  Hello, everybody!

00:38.872 --> 00:40.038
Oh, good evening,
master.

00:40.040 --> 00:41.540
                We were worried
              about you, master.

00:41.542 --> 00:42.874
      Well, I got, uh--
        I got tied up.

00:42.876 --> 00:44.576
             Well, listen, if
          we're going to dinner,

00:44.578 --> 00:45.977
             we'd better make it
                an early one.

00:45.979 --> 00:47.646
              We gotta be at
         the simulator tomorrow,

00:47.648 --> 00:48.846

00:48.848 --> 00:49.981
     I won't be there, Roge.

00:49.983 --> 00:51.483

             you won't be there?

00:51.485 --> 00:53.385
     Well, I've just come
    from General Peterson.

00:53.387 --> 00:54.986
           I'm not in
   the space program anymore.

an astronaut, master?

     That's right, Jeannie.

01:59.286 --> 02:00.585
             I can't believe it.

                 do that to you.

     Oh, they didn't do it.
           I did it.

      Why--? Why would you
 want to do a thing like that?

02:10.631 --> 02:13.165
  Look, Roge, um, I'll wash up
  and we'll go out to dinner.

02:13.167 --> 02:14.899
         I'd rather not
      discuss it tonight.

   You don't want to discuss it.

      You quit the program

    You don't wanna discuss it?

  the whole thing without me.

       You don't need me.
       I don't need you.

02:33.487 --> 02:36.254
Major Healey seemed very upset.

02:36.256 --> 02:39.090
   Yeah, he is a little shocked,
         isn't he? Well...

02:39.092 --> 02:41.927
You really do not have to go
back to Cape Kennedy, master?

02:41.929 --> 02:42.928

03:02.215 --> 03:04.482
East to west...
or west to east.

03:04.484 --> 03:06.685
We're going to go
to Columbus, Ohio.

03:06.687 --> 03:08.520
       What is a Columbus, Ohio?

03:08.522 --> 03:09.921
   It's a city, Jeannie.

03:09.923 --> 03:12.057
I haven't retired, you know.
    I've got a new job.

03:12.059 --> 03:13.558
       What kind of a job?

03:13.560 --> 03:15.193
Well, I'm going to head up a--

03:15.195 --> 03:18.129
A company that makes booster
 rockets for our missiles.

03:18.131 --> 03:20.632

and live in this Columbus, Ohio

       than be an astronaut?

03:21.935 --> 03:23.902
     It's not a question
    of what I'd rather do.

03:23.904 --> 03:25.370
    It's that I couldn't
       turn it down.

03:25.372 --> 03:26.738
         Hm. Well, why not?

03:26.740 --> 03:30.042
   Because three senators
     and four generals

03:30.044 --> 03:31.442
      asked me to take it.

03:31.444 --> 03:35.180
     It seems that the man
   who was in charge retired,

03:35.182 --> 03:37.015
       and there was no one else
           to take his place.

  Well, if it makes you happy,
       it makes me happy.

03:40.154 --> 03:42.187
           Oh, yeah.
   Why shouldn't I be happy?

  I'm gonna be vice president
    in charge of production.

--your place in the space
program is still open.

21:24.550 --> 21:25.983
    Major.
                Oh, yes, sir.

21:25.985 --> 21:27.785
I've just heard the news.
       Is it true?

21:27.787 --> 21:29.353
               Oh, that's right.
                 I'm not going.

21:29.355 --> 21:31.522
       [SIGHS]
                  I'll certainly
                  miss you, sir.

21:31.524 --> 21:32.823
                I hope you enjoy
                  your cruise.

21:32.825 --> 21:33.991
        Cruise?
                     Yes.

21:33.993 --> 21:35.793
     Oh, do you think
I'll leave you here alone?

21:35.795 --> 21:38.362
         Oh, no, major.
If you're staying, I'm staying.

21:38.364 --> 21:40.197
I'll just go and get back
     my resignation.

21:41.367 --> 21:43.367
       No, no, no.
     No, I'm leaving.

21:43.369 --> 21:45.035
        Oh, yes.

21:45.037 --> 21:46.036
      Oh!

21:46.038 --> 21:47.037
I see you're unpacking.

21:47.039 --> 21:48.338
  [CHUCKLES]
                   Huh?

21:48.340 --> 21:50.240
          Oh, yeah, I guess you
         haven't heard the news.

21:50.242 --> 21:51.241
Uh, news?
                   I'm--

21:51.243 --> 21:52.410
                    Yeah, I'm--
                  I'm not going.

21:52.412 --> 21:54.311
 You're not go--?
Why, what happened?

21:54.313 --> 21:56.514
       Oh, well, there was this,
        uh, Professor Lakewood.

21:56.516 --> 21:57.981
                He had a wife
            who wouldn't leave--

21:57.983 --> 21:59.650
           Hello, master.
                         Oh.

21:59.652 --> 22:01.452
        I am ready to leave
        for Columbus, Ohio.

22:01.454 --> 22:03.854
  We're not going to Columbus.
   We're staying right here.

22:03.856 --> 22:05.122
                     We are?

22:06.192 --> 22:07.424
                  What happened?

22:07.426 --> 22:09.259
ROGER:
This professor and his wife

22:09.261 --> 22:11.028
were driven out of
their house by snakes.

22:11.030 --> 22:13.931
The snakes ran under the bedroom
and she came out screaming.

22:13.933 --> 22:15.499
         Wait a minute.
     How do you know that?

22:17.135 --> 22:18.936
                  A lucky guess?

22:18.938 --> 22:19.937
             Jeannie.

22:19.939 --> 22:21.304
  I have some house cleaning.

22:21.306 --> 22:23.807
     Jeannie, did you send those
      snakes to that poor woman?

22:23.809 --> 22:25.375
         Oh, please,
   do not be angry, master.

22:25.377 --> 22:26.510
   I only did it to help you.

22:26.512 --> 22:27.978
                 Don't be angry?
                 You're asking--

22:27.980 --> 22:29.346
 Wait a minute.
Don't blame her.

22:29.348 --> 22:30.447
It was my idea.

22:30.449 --> 22:31.949
I guess we shouldn't
   have butted in

22:31.951 --> 22:33.383
in the first place, huh?

22:33.385 --> 22:35.986
    Well, if you hadn't had,
  I'd never have forgiven you.

22:37.156 --> 22:38.556
               Do you mean that?

22:38.558 --> 22:40.190
         Of course I do.

22:41.360 --> 22:42.493
            Oh, master!

22:42.495 --> 22:43.527
         [DELIGHTED SQUEAL]

22:44.463 --> 22:46.229
  Oh, does he not look handsome?

22:46.231 --> 22:48.131
Oh, welcome back.
                      [LAUGHING]

22:48.133 --> 22:50.033
                 Thank you.
            Thank you very much.

22:51.904 --> 22:54.038
  Well, I'm sorry you're busy
      tonight, Pat, uh...

22:54.040 --> 22:56.073
         Yeah, heh-heh,
          you have to.

22:56.075 --> 22:57.908
           Well, uh,
  maybe some other time, then.

22:57.910 --> 22:58.942
        Yeah, bye, yeah.

22:58.944 --> 23:00.944
      Nice talking to you.

23:01.914 --> 23:03.346
            [SIGHS]

23:04.750 --> 23:06.684
[WHISTLING]

23:06.686 --> 23:08.018
             Um, any luck, Roge?

23:08.020 --> 23:09.319
Well, uh,

23:09.321 --> 23:10.688
everyone's got
a date tonight.

23:10.690 --> 23:12.255
You know how busy
Monday nights are.

23:12.257 --> 23:14.658
                      Yeah.
       Yeah.

23:14.660 --> 23:16.293
      Listen, do you mind
        if just the, uh,

23:16.295 --> 23:17.727
          three of us
     go to dinner tonight?

23:17.729 --> 23:18.962
  Oh, of course not.

23:18.964 --> 23:20.197
                   No, no, fine.

23:20.199 --> 23:22.332
             Yeah.
      Hey, wait a minute.

23:22.334 --> 23:24.168
Do you know that
cute little secretary,

23:24.170 --> 23:26.136
   the one without the veil,
          with the--?

23:27.072 --> 23:28.606
     Oh, yes.

23:28.608 --> 23:31.107
Well, I was wondering, if she's
  not doing anything tonight,

23:31.109 --> 23:32.709
     maybe you could, uh--

23:34.012 --> 23:36.313
Is it all right, master?
                    Hm?

23:36.315 --> 23:38.215
          Oh, I don't know.
    I haven't seen her, but if--

23:38.217 --> 23:40.618
   If it's all right with Roger,
         it's okay with me.

23:40.620 --> 23:42.285
     Oh, she's beautiful.
       You'll love her.

23:42.287 --> 23:44.555
  Oh, just-- Would you mind,
   Jeannie? Just, you know?

23:44.557 --> 23:45.556
   Of course.

23:47.760 --> 23:50.027
I'm used to getting picked up
        at my place.

23:50.029 --> 23:52.128
   I hope we don't go
to some cheap restaurant.

23:52.130 --> 23:55.599
        I'm all dressed up,
  and I wanna go someplace nice.

23:55.601 --> 23:57.835
I spent $29.50
on this dress,

23:57.837 --> 23:59.302
and I don't wanna waste it.

23:59.304 --> 24:01.438
                After dinner,
             I wanna go dancing.

24:01.440 --> 24:03.340
     If there's anything I hate,
          it's a cheap date

24:03.342 --> 24:05.809
   who won't take you dancing.
 The last fellow I went out with

24:05.811 --> 24:08.379
     insisted that we go to some
    crummy place. We ended up...

24:08.381 --> 24:09.880

24:11.950 --> 24:16.186
