<i> If you live in a major city,</i>

00:05.080 --> 00:08.582
chances are you cross paths
with a hundred people a day.

00:08.658 --> 00:12.461
Your barista, the guy standing
next to you on the subway.

00:12.537 --> 00:15.589
Over the course of your life,
that means

00:15.665 --> 00:20.677
you will cross paths
with 41 unapprehended murderers.

00:20.688 --> 00:22.012
On average.

00:22.023 --> 00:25.307
But out of those 41,

00:25.383 --> 00:28.310
how many are true psychopaths?

00:28.386 --> 00:31.238
I mean, anyone
could be a murderer.

00:32.182 --> 00:36.026
Wrong place, wrong time.

00:36.037 --> 00:38.987
An accident. An impulse.

00:39.064 --> 00:41.114
Oh, God, Malcolm. What happened?

00:41.191 --> 00:43.617
But there's another type
of killer.

00:43.693 --> 00:46.953
For them,
murder is an addiction.

00:47.030 --> 00:49.590
A bad love they can't quit.

00:50.492 --> 00:55.003
Truth is, anyone can do it once.

00:55.080 --> 00:57.380
But the second kill,

00:57.391 --> 00:59.549
that's when the switch
is flipped

00:59.560 --> 01:01.676
and a serial killer is born.

01:01.753 --> 01:06.231
I don't know what happened.
I blacked out again.

01:07.902 --> 01:09.401
I'm sorry.

01:09.478 --> 01:11.111
I didn't know where else to go.

01:11.814 --> 01:13.405
It's okay.

01:13.482 --> 01:15.574
We don't know what you did,
and it's not that much.

01:15.651 --> 01:17.076
We need to get you cleaned up.

Breathe. Focus.

01:19.488 --> 01:21.363
Think really hard.

01:21.439 --> 01:23.990
-Can you remember anything?
-No.

01:24.067 --> 01:26.076
No, not even a flash.

01:26.087 --> 01:28.087
Malcolm, why didn't you tell me
sooner that I killed Endicott?

01:28.163 --> 01:30.163
If I had known
what I was capable of,

01:30.240 --> 01:32.666
-a-about my blackouts...
-You can't think like that.

01:32.742 --> 01:35.052
I could've stopped this.

01:36.338 --> 01:38.555
You're right, Ainsley.

01:40.434 --> 01:42.059

Thanks. So, what do we have?

03:50.088 --> 03:51.471
Vic is Dr. Nicole Zhang,

03:51.548 --> 03:53.515
head of plastic surgery
at Saint Anthony's.

03:53.591 --> 03:54.716
That's a public hospital.

03:54.793 --> 03:56.017
They have a plastic surgery
department?

03:56.094 --> 03:58.019
Everything's done
pro bono or at cost.

03:58.096 --> 04:01.231
You don't get a condo in
this building working pro bono.

04:01.242 --> 04:03.149
She made her money
in private practice.

04:03.226 --> 04:05.577
Founded the Lexington Collective
with Fred Chabra

04:05.654 --> 04:07.329

04:16.665 --> 04:18.081
just one murder today?

DANI:
What, one isn't doing it

04:19.668 --> 04:20.583

04:20.594 --> 04:21.710
I could keep my ear

04:21.786 --> 04:23.336
to the ground if you like.

04:23.413 --> 04:26.265
Actually I could use your help
with something.

04:26.300 --> 04:27.424
-Are you free...
-Yes.

04:27.434 --> 04:29.050
He didn't even give a time.

04:29.127 --> 04:32.020
Great. I'll, uh, swing by
the lab tonight?

04:32.514 --> 04:33.596
It's a date.

04:33.607 --> 04:35.348
Can we just focus on this case?

04:35.425 --> 04:39.236
'Cause I think we're about
to have our hands full.

04:41.598 --> 04:43.365
Oh, yeah, the-- Yes.

04:50.440 --> 04:51.698
Tell me more.

04:51.775 --> 04:55.460
To put it in fun terms,
she was Botoxed to death.

04:57.131 --> 05:01.458
I mean, i-in less fun terms,
her death was excruciating.

05:01.468 --> 05:03.969
Based on the bruising,
this is the first injection.

05:04.046 --> 05:07.255
I suspect that the killer dosed
Zhang with a paralytic agent.

05:07.332 --> 05:09.215
So she was conscious
the whole time.

05:09.292 --> 05:12.469
Which means this isn't just
murder, it was torture.

05:12.479 --> 05:14.596
DANI: According to everyone
at Saint Anthony's,

05:14.672 --> 05:16.097
this woman was an angel.

05:16.174 --> 05:17.983
Awards say the same thing.

05:18.060 --> 05:19.526
So, who would want to kill her?

05:19.561 --> 05:20.819
BRIGHT:
Someone from before the awards.

05:20.896 --> 05:22.437
Someone from her past.

05:22.514 --> 05:24.156
DANI: There's nothing
from her private practice days,

05:24.232 --> 05:26.149
even though it was
a massive success.

05:26.160 --> 05:28.443
Which means
her decision to give back

05:28.520 --> 05:29.903
may not have been arbitrary.

05:29.979 --> 05:32.113
She could be atoning
for something.

05:32.190 --> 05:34.240
But our killer knew the truth.

05:34.317 --> 05:36.159
That's why they disfigured her.

05:36.170 --> 05:39.004
To show us what she truly is.

05:40.582 --> 05:42.165
A monster.

-Oh.

06:04.514 --> 06:07.607
Ah. Stuck on a yacht
for all of quarantine.

06:07.684 --> 06:09.201
-Aw.
-Total nightmare.

06:09.277 --> 06:12.204
But now I'm back

06:14.541 --> 06:18.034

Just what nobody needs.

06:21.573 --> 06:23.665

06:23.741 --> 06:26.835
Why are you here, Birdie?

06:26.911 --> 06:29.054

06:29.172 --> 06:30.630

the board

07:10.264 --> 07:11.430

07:11.506 --> 07:14.048
Well, they did, but, uh,

07:14.125 --> 07:16.342
they could never
revoke my joie de vivre.

07:16.419 --> 07:19.220
You've been assigned janitorial
duties in my infirmary.

07:19.297 --> 07:22.015
I have a one-strike policy.

07:22.091 --> 07:25.226
So make sure
you don't kill anyone.

07:25.303 --> 07:26.486

07:26.521 --> 07:27.612
Wow, I like

07:40.276 --> 07:42.619
Tether him to the sink
and remove his hand restraints.

07:42.629 --> 07:46.256
I need you to clean
the prolific bedpans.

07:49.044 --> 07:53.630
It's been a while,
so don't be shy.

07:53.640 --> 07:54.973

What do you got?

08:09.472 --> 08:12.565

So, a regular morning for you.

08:15.478 --> 08:17.329
They all grew up
hating themselves.

08:17.405 --> 08:20.156
Gacy for his sexuality,
Kearney for his height,

08:20.167 --> 08:22.075
Miyazaki because of
a birth defect.

08:22.151 --> 08:24.836
When they mutilated
their victims,

08:24.913 --> 08:26.621
-it was projection.
-You think our killer
is deformed?

08:26.698 --> 08:29.999
Uh-huh. Or at least
they feel like they are.

08:30.010 --> 08:31.067
Makes sense.

08:31.069 --> 08:32.511
Sometimes the most
monstrous people

08:32.587 --> 08:34.429

-What about the toxicology?
-The paralytic

09:41.397 --> 09:43.248

neurotoxin was a patented blend.

The Lexington Collective's
Radiance Solution?

10:41.457 --> 10:44.309

at the moment.

10:44.386 --> 10:46.302

10:46.313 --> 10:47.804

10:47.814 --> 10:49.263

10:49.340 --> 10:52.392
Look, from someone
who was lost once, too,

10:52.468 --> 10:53.976
my advice is...

10:53.987 --> 10:55.987
be there for her, but...

10:56.064 --> 10:58.156
don't let her
drag you down with her.

10:59.326 --> 11:00.492
What if she already has?

11:00.568 --> 11:02.160
How?

11:02.687 --> 11:05.163
Bright, you can tell me.

11:05.666 --> 11:06.989
(chuckles)
I'm overthinking it.

11:07.000 --> 11:08.166
How about we focus

11:08.243 --> 11:10.243

11:10.319 --> 11:11.461
Zhang's murder.

11:17.702 --> 11:21.087

And suddenly
I feel super insecure.

11:42.610 --> 11:44.610

I mean, we haven't spoken to her

11:56.717 --> 11:59.217
but the three of us go
all the way back to med school.

11:59.294 --> 12:01.386
-Why did you fall out of touch?
-CHABRA: You know...

12:01.463 --> 12:04.264
-Life.
-Different paths.

12:05.258 --> 12:07.559
Nicole wanted to do
the whole pro bono thing,

12:07.635 --> 12:09.969
and, uh...

12:10.046 --> 12:12.439
Chabra and I have
different goals.

12:13.716 --> 12:15.516
Work hard, play hard.

12:15.593 --> 12:17.110

12:24.060 --> 12:25.243

12:25.320 --> 12:26.903
You're holding tension
in your jaw.

12:26.913 --> 12:28.488
Could lead to premature jowling.

12:28.564 --> 12:30.239

some product samples to help...

12:30.250 --> 12:32.917
I'm good.

12:32.994 --> 12:35.328
Speaking of product, Dr. Chabra,

12:35.404 --> 12:37.079
you're head of the lab, right?

12:37.090 --> 12:38.757
That's correct.

12:38.833 --> 12:40.500
Our killer had access
to surgical-grade materials,

12:40.576 --> 12:43.511
and your Radiance Solution
is our murder weapon.

12:44.339 --> 12:46.547
Has any inventory
gone missing lately?

12:46.624 --> 12:48.257
Absolutely not.

12:48.268 --> 12:50.935

12:58.019 --> 13:01.020
Uh, this is just all
so horrible.

13:01.097 --> 13:02.947
I mean,
I-I didn't know Dr. Zhang.

13:03.024 --> 13:05.566
I've, um... I've only
been here a few months.

13:05.643 --> 13:09.195
But if anything was missing,
I would've told the doctors.

13:09.272 --> 13:12.207
I mean, especially Dr. Donahue.

13:13.126 --> 13:16.035
He's always, uh,
checking up on me,

13:16.112 --> 13:17.912
if you know what I mean.

13:17.989 --> 13:20.006
Unfortunately, I do.

13:20.542 --> 13:22.041
Send over your records,

13:22.118 --> 13:23.459
and we'll call
if we have any questions.

13:23.470 --> 13:25.094
Okay. Thank you.

13:28.049 --> 13:30.216
I want Donahue to be
the bad guy.

13:30.293 --> 13:33.219
Yeah, anyone who says
"work hard, play hard"

13:33.296 --> 13:35.304
definitely has a coke problem.

13:35.357 --> 13:37.098
And he clearly has
hegemonic masculinity.

13:37.174 --> 13:39.150
-Is that fancy for "toxic"?
-More or less.

13:39.227 --> 13:40.977
It's why he works so well
with Dr. Chabra,

13:40.987 --> 13:42.987
who's complicitly masculine.

13:43.064 --> 13:44.397
He will tell us the ugly truth.

13:44.473 --> 13:46.491
-How do we get him to talk?
-Easy.

13:46.568 --> 13:48.993
We just isolate him
with our own alpha males.

13:49.520 --> 13:51.204
(door slams shut)

13:54.650 --> 13:56.993
I-I really can't say anything
without my lawyer.

13:57.003 --> 13:58.452

You afraid you might confess

13:58.529 --> 14:00.997

14:02.700 --> 14:04.467

Hey. Hey.

14:06.847 --> 14:08.337
Hey, I have nothing to hide.

14:08.348 --> 14:10.348
J-Just tell me
what you want to know.

14:10.425 --> 14:13.426
Our killer has a grudge
against Zhang,

14:13.502 --> 14:16.345
your business,

14:16.356 --> 14:18.681
and the medical knowledge
to pull it all off.

14:18.692 --> 14:20.600
Who fits that bill?

14:20.676 --> 14:22.977
Hey, hey.

14:23.054 --> 14:24.645
The second
I found out about this,

14:24.722 --> 14:26.197
one person came to mind.

14:26.274 --> 14:28.482
Francine Depaugh.

14:28.559 --> 14:29.984
-A former patient.
-JT: What's the story there?

14:30.061 --> 14:31.944
She was one of our best clients.

14:32.021 --> 14:34.989
But then she got addicted to
the work, always wanting more.

14:35.066 --> 14:37.116
Zhang wanted to cut her off,
Donahue didn't.

14:37.193 --> 14:39.327
-That's when Dr. Zhang
left your practice?
-Yes.

14:39.403 --> 14:42.046
But after that, Francine got
to be too much, even for us.

14:42.123 --> 14:44.457
(scoffs) She sued.
It got messy.

14:44.533 --> 14:46.551
She fell off the map
about six months ago.

14:46.628 --> 14:49.170
I-I assumed she just gave up.

14:49.246 --> 14:51.881
Or maybe she pivoted to plan B--

14:51.892 --> 14:54.058
murder.

what you wanted.

21:01.836 --> 21:03.002
Yes.

21:03.078 --> 21:06.880
Which means I had no reason
to hurt anyone.

21:06.957 --> 21:10.175
What it means is, you're in
possession of our murder weapon.

21:10.252 --> 21:12.594
(laughs):
Oh, that's absurd.

21:12.605 --> 21:14.355
I...

21:16.442 --> 21:18.192
(sighs)

21:19.020 --> 21:21.061
Donahue and I came to
an agreement.

21:21.138 --> 21:23.447
He supplied me
with the Radiance Solution.

21:23.524 --> 21:25.858
In exchange for what?

21:25.934 --> 21:27.576
My silence.

21:28.479 --> 21:32.614
For what they did
to poor little Lana.

21:32.625 --> 21:36.577
BRIGHT:
Lana Anders,
student from the UK.

21:36.653 --> 21:39.455
Went to med school
with Donahue and Chabra.

21:39.465 --> 21:40.965
Star of the class.

21:41.042 --> 21:42.291
Bound for greatness.

21:42.302 --> 21:43.968
Our Neanderthal Donahue
convinced her

21:44.045 --> 21:45.252
that she would never
have a career

21:45.329 --> 21:46.879
unless she "looked the part."

21:46.955 --> 21:48.297
BRIGHT:
He wrangled Chabra and Zhang

21:48.308 --> 21:50.466
to perform
a malar augmentation--

21:50.476 --> 21:53.302
a lifting of the cheekbones.

21:53.313 --> 21:55.637
But Donahue was young,
inexperienced.

21:55.648 --> 21:57.222
He screwed up.

21:57.299 --> 21:59.266
Left Lana disfigured.

21:59.343 --> 22:00.818
She dropped out soon after.

22:00.895 --> 22:02.561
Disfigurement. Betrayal.

22:02.638 --> 22:03.979
Sounds like she'd have
every reason to want revenge.

22:03.990 --> 22:04.971
Where's Lana now?

22:05.049 --> 22:06.774
I'm still trying
to figure it out.

22:06.850 --> 22:08.567
She left the country
after her student visa expired,

22:08.644 --> 22:10.861
and there is no record
of her reentering the States.

22:10.938 --> 22:12.571
Well, Francine's alibi
checks out.

22:12.648 --> 22:14.665
And Lana's nowhere to be found.
So who else do we have?

22:14.742 --> 22:16.241
Donahue fits.

22:16.318 --> 22:19.078
A controlled perfectionist
who molds people.

22:19.154 --> 22:23.174
What if Zhang felt troubled
by her past?

22:23.250 --> 22:26.093
Covering up
her partner's crimes?

22:27.421 --> 22:31.140
The weight of it all
could have become unbearable.

22:33.019 --> 22:35.186
Dr. Jekyll couldn't have
everyone finding out

22:35.262 --> 22:37.188
-he's Mr. Hyde.
-Two good suspects.

22:37.264 --> 22:39.264
Dani, go see
what Chabra knows about Lana.

22:39.341 --> 22:41.275
I'll be waiting for Donahue
when he gets home.

22:45.365 --> 22:47.439
Bright,
Jessica's called me twice.

22:47.516 --> 22:49.149
Hurricane Birdie
has touched down,

22:49.226 --> 22:50.534
and you are due at dinner.

22:50.611 --> 22:51.869
Let me know
if I need to call in SWAT.

22:51.946 --> 22:52.986
Don't.

22:53.063 --> 22:55.122
Birdie would eat them alive.

22:57.359 --> 22:59.368
(indistinct chatter, laughter)

22:59.379 --> 23:01.337
Ah! (laughs)

23:03.290 --> 23:04.164
Ainsley?

23:04.241 --> 23:06.291
I've been calling you all day.

23:06.368 --> 23:09.095
-Have you?
-I thought you were
feeling sick.

23:09.580 --> 23:12.014
I'm feeling a lot of things.

23:14.585 --> 23:18.137
I didn't realize there'd be
theater with our dinner tonight.

23:18.213 --> 23:20.564
Yes, enough with the drama.

23:20.641 --> 23:22.057
Malcolm, you're being rude.

23:22.068 --> 23:23.526
Say hello to your aunt.

23:24.553 --> 23:25.853
Birdie.

23:25.929 --> 23:27.405
Malcolm.

23:27.481 --> 23:29.731
Looking more like
your father every day.

23:29.742 --> 23:31.200
(snorts)

23:36.082 --> 23:37.030
There it is.

23:37.107 --> 23:38.416
MARTIN:
And fluid.

23:38.492 --> 23:40.576
His intracranial pressure
must be through the roof.

23:40.586 --> 23:41.994
You're gonna have
to relieve it manually.

23:42.070 --> 23:44.255
I don't have
neurosurgical tools on hand.

23:44.331 --> 23:46.999
I'm lucky to have a
30-year-old ultrasound machine.

23:47.075 --> 23:48.092
Well, I love to improvise.

23:48.169 --> 23:49.168
Oh! I'm sure maintenance has

23:49.244 --> 23:51.378
a DeWalt and drill bits.

23:51.455 --> 23:53.922
You want me to put a burr hole
in his head with a power drill?

23:53.933 --> 23:54.840
MARTIN:
Could be worse.

23:54.917 --> 23:56.550
The Aztecs used sharpened rocks.

23:56.627 --> 23:58.436
Yeah. They also skinned people
alive to bring rain.

23:58.512 --> 24:00.604
True. But the rocks worked.

24:00.681 --> 24:02.181
The ambulance is
ten minutes out.

24:02.257 --> 24:03.557
Might as well be a hearse.

24:03.634 --> 24:05.109
I could do it.

24:05.186 --> 24:07.111
If my hands were free.

24:08.022 --> 24:10.105
Get me five milligrams
of Diazepam

24:10.116 --> 24:13.442
and a gram of ancef to IV push,
and a scalpel.

24:13.453 --> 24:15.119
What bit shall I use?

24:15.196 --> 24:16.612
9/16 should be just fine.

24:16.622 --> 24:18.247
And a drill set.

24:19.483 --> 24:20.532
Now.

24:20.609 --> 24:21.783
If he dies...

24:21.794 --> 24:23.461
Just put it on my tab.

24:32.162 --> 24:33.629
Gently.

24:33.639 --> 24:37.016
Gently...

24:54.184 --> 24:55.993
How did we do?

24:59.999 --> 25:02.249
It actually worked.

25:03.410 --> 25:05.461
(whispers):
We did it.

25:08.508 --> 25:11.008
Get Whitly out of here.

25:11.585 --> 25:12.751
(footsteps approaching)

25:12.828 --> 25:14.261
GUARD:
Come on, Doc.

25:21.762 --> 25:24.063
(door closes)

25:29.720 --> 25:31.487
(utensils clinking)

25:32.556 --> 25:34.532
(knife sawing)

25:42.190 --> 25:43.657
BIRDIE:
So, Malcolm,

25:43.734 --> 25:46.877
I hear you're profiling
murderers for the NYPD.

25:46.954 --> 25:49.371
Yes, I'm with Major Crimes.

25:49.382 --> 25:52.508
That's quite a demotion
from the FBI, isn't it?

25:53.535 --> 25:56.169
Well, if we all took ten years
between career attempts,

25:56.246 --> 25:58.055
the family trust fund
would run dry.

25:58.132 --> 25:59.506
-(chuckles weakly)
-(Birdie scoffs)

25:59.583 --> 26:04.136
(soft chuckle)
You're so... peculiar.

26:04.212 --> 26:07.222
If my father was
a serial killer,

26:07.233 --> 26:11.527
I'm not sure I'd be leaning
into it quite so much.

26:13.573 --> 26:16.064
I guess the difference is
that he killed people

26:16.075 --> 26:17.649
and, uh, I save them.

26:17.726 --> 26:19.026
Most of the time, anyway.

26:19.102 --> 26:20.494
(gags, coughs)

26:26.586 --> 26:29.587
How about we go grab
a nice Bordeaux, Ainsley?

26:29.663 --> 26:32.006
One of Birdie's favorites.

26:40.433 --> 26:42.674
BIRDIE:
Is it always like this?

26:42.751 --> 26:45.394
Uh... (laughs)

26:46.380 --> 26:48.147
Not at all.

26:49.299 --> 26:50.682
(quietly):
Where have you been all day?

26:50.759 --> 26:52.267
I tried to retrace my steps,

26:52.278 --> 26:54.353
and I lost track of time.

26:54.429 --> 26:55.446
Why would you do that?

26:55.522 --> 26:56.605
I told you
I could handle everything.

26:56.616 --> 26:58.023
I was just trying to help.

26:58.100 --> 26:59.900
-Don't.
<i> -BIRDIE: Come on.</i>

26:59.976 --> 27:01.493
I'm your sister.

27:02.288 --> 27:05.205
This life you live, it's...

27:06.459 --> 27:09.368
And when I heard about
Nicholas Endicott...

27:09.444 --> 27:11.128
More murder?

27:11.205 --> 27:13.038
I can't even imagine.

27:13.115 --> 27:15.374
You're concerned.

27:15.450 --> 27:16.917
Of course.

27:16.993 --> 27:18.627
Why do you think I came?

27:18.638 --> 27:21.296
You've been through hell.

27:21.307 --> 27:24.141
You need someone to talk to.

27:24.977 --> 27:26.977
Or at least drink with.

27:27.054 --> 27:28.261
(exhales)

27:28.338 --> 27:30.389
Let your guard down, Sis.

27:30.465 --> 27:32.149
I'm here for you.

27:33.152 --> 27:35.444
Thank you.

27:38.658 --> 27:41.233
(quietly):
I can only keep you
out of trouble

27:41.309 --> 27:42.484
if you listen to me.

27:42.495 --> 27:45.037
(phone vibrating)

27:46.314 --> 27:47.998
Hey, Gil. What's the update?

27:48.075 --> 27:49.500
Donahue didn't show.

27:49.576 --> 27:52.411
JT's watching the place now,
and I'm putting out a BOLO.

27:52.487 --> 27:54.329
I got a bad feeling
he's in the wind.

27:54.340 --> 27:56.623
Damn it. He could be our guy.

27:56.700 --> 27:58.333
I need to talk to Chabra.

27:58.344 --> 27:59.584
Dani said the same.

27:59.661 --> 28:01.294
She's on her way
to the Collective now.

28:01.371 --> 28:02.429
Great.

28:03.757 --> 28:06.141
(sighs) Okay.

28:12.358 --> 28:13.515
Dr. Chabra?

28:13.526 --> 28:15.359
Do you have his number?

28:16.511 --> 28:18.103
(Chabra grunting)

28:18.180 --> 28:20.355
Dr. Chabra!
Who did this to you?

28:20.366 --> 28:22.190
Didn't see.

28:22.201 --> 28:24.109
I-I think... Donahue.

28:24.186 --> 28:25.819
I betrayed him.

28:25.896 --> 28:27.204
Giving you Francine.

28:27.281 --> 28:29.540
We're gonna get you
to a hospital, okay?

28:32.286 --> 28:34.536
Dr. Chabra? The solution's
setting in already.

28:34.547 --> 28:37.330
His systems are shutting down.
We need to get him back, now!

28:37.407 --> 28:40.125
-Is there some kind of antidote?
-Yes, but--

28:40.202 --> 28:41.276
no.

28:41.278 --> 28:42.836
An antitoxin will
slow the neurotoxin,

28:42.913 --> 28:44.722
but it won't counteract
the paralytic agent.

28:44.798 --> 28:48.100
We can get his heart rate back
up with a stimulant, like, um...

28:49.419 --> 28:51.228
Cocaine!

28:53.423 --> 28:54.565
Dani!

28:57.260 --> 28:58.560
I got the stuff you asked for.

28:58.571 --> 29:00.061
Is that a paperweight?

29:00.072 --> 29:01.530
Not just a paperweight.

29:04.151 --> 29:06.151
It's Donahue's secret stash.

29:06.228 --> 29:08.412
-How did you know?
-Uh, the way he was handling it.

29:08.489 --> 29:09.905
And, you know...

29:09.915 --> 29:12.124
what else would you hide
in a cheetah?

29:12.734 --> 29:15.461
Okay. Uh, let's see. Um...

29:16.613 --> 29:19.214
About a gram of cocaine.

29:22.094 --> 29:26.388
200 milliliters of saline.

29:29.268 --> 29:31.101
-Any luck with the lidocaine?
-I couldn't find any.

29:31.178 --> 29:33.094
Cool. No big deal.

29:33.105 --> 29:35.096
Just, uh, shake this up.

29:35.107 --> 29:36.440
Bright, is it a big deal?

29:36.517 --> 29:38.016
No. No.

29:38.093 --> 29:39.109
Only if I got the dose wrong--

29:39.186 --> 29:40.426
which I'm sure I didn't.

29:40.504 --> 29:43.396
Lidocaine helps prevent
a fatal arrhythmia.

29:43.473 --> 29:45.607
Dr. Chabra could die?

29:45.618 --> 29:47.067
Well, he's gonna die anyway.

29:47.143 --> 29:49.453
We can't kill him twice.

29:50.438 --> 29:51.571
Uh, okay.

29:51.648 --> 29:53.406
There...

29:53.483 --> 29:56.043
Okay. Right.

29:57.704 --> 29:59.296
All right!

29:59.373 --> 30:00.789
Beautiful. Okay.

30:00.800 --> 30:02.299
Now, next step:

30:02.376 --> 30:05.043
we're gonna fast-track this
right into his heart.

30:05.120 --> 30:07.262
This is the worst
cooking show ever.

30:11.644 --> 30:13.143
Don't worry.

30:13.220 --> 30:14.427
This will work.

30:14.504 --> 30:16.188
Maybe.

30:17.465 --> 30:18.565
(Bright exhales)

30:20.060 --> 30:21.401
Okay. Uh...

30:25.732 --> 30:28.158
(Bright panting)

30:46.420 --> 30:48.637
(gasping)

30:51.207 --> 30:53.058
(coughing)

31:00.559 --> 31:02.234
I do not miss drugs.

31:19.378 --> 31:21.494
(gentle classical music plays)

31:21.571 --> 31:23.630
(quiet chatter)

31:26.201 --> 31:27.885
(Jessica clears throat)

31:27.961 --> 31:30.178
He isn't coming, Birdie.

31:31.891 --> 31:33.515
What are you doing here?

31:35.728 --> 31:37.895
You did seem genuine last night.

31:37.971 --> 31:39.730
A caring ear,
a shoulder to cry on,

31:39.848 --> 31:41.231
but... (chuckles)

31:41.308 --> 31:43.058
...with this family,
I have learned

31:43.068 --> 31:45.644
that it is always best to trust

31:45.720 --> 31:48.021
but verify.

31:48.098 --> 31:50.908
I'm not the Soviets, Jess.

31:50.984 --> 31:52.984
You have no idea
what I've been through.

31:53.061 --> 31:55.153
JESSICA:
I think I have
a very clear idea.

31:55.230 --> 31:58.990
You have sold a tell-all book
about your big sis.

31:59.067 --> 32:00.575
Mrs. Martin Whitly.

32:00.586 --> 32:01.919
I can explain.

32:01.995 --> 32:03.086
Wait...

32:03.163 --> 32:05.205
for my martini.

32:05.281 --> 32:06.590
Here you are, Mrs. Whitly.

32:06.667 --> 32:07.925
Thank you.

32:08.001 --> 32:10.335
Mm... (chuckles softly)

32:10.412 --> 32:11.878
I'm broke.

32:11.955 --> 32:14.089
-(laughs)
-And Mummy's cut me off.

32:14.099 --> 32:16.266
Claims she's
the only billionaire

32:16.343 --> 32:18.176
to have lost money
during the pandemic.

32:18.253 --> 32:20.261
Oh, well, then, by all means,
exploit my life's tragedies

32:20.272 --> 32:22.105
in your poorly written
dime-store novel.

32:22.182 --> 32:23.774
You think I want
to write a book?

32:23.850 --> 32:26.109
I barely read them.

32:26.186 --> 32:28.561
But they came to me with
an offer I couldn't refuse.

32:28.638 --> 32:30.271
Hmm.

32:30.282 --> 32:33.066
And so I will double it,
and then it goes away.

32:33.143 --> 32:35.026
And you with it.

32:35.103 --> 32:37.070
That's a marvelous gesture,

32:37.147 --> 32:39.498
but it won't solve
your problems.

32:40.125 --> 32:43.243
Cache Publishing is
desperate for this book.

32:43.319 --> 32:45.587
They'll move forward
with or without me.

32:50.210 --> 32:52.469
Then I have no other option.

32:54.164 --> 32:56.965
In order to control
the narrative,

32:56.976 --> 33:00.260
I will offer them my memoir.

33:00.336 --> 33:01.970
(sighs)

33:01.981 --> 33:04.305
Lord knows they've been
asking for it for years.

33:04.316 --> 33:07.225
And you can have the advance.
Hmm.

33:07.302 --> 33:10.070
Oh, they'll pay
through the nose for that.

33:11.139 --> 33:12.656
I swear,

33:12.733 --> 33:16.159
I'll repay you as soon
as my accounts are unfrozen.

33:17.479 --> 33:19.329
Don't bother.

33:20.148 --> 33:22.907
Just do one thing.

33:22.984 --> 33:25.118
If Mummy asks
about your visit...

33:25.195 --> 33:27.328
Dinner with your family

33:27.339 --> 33:29.381
was a Rockwell painting.

33:34.513 --> 33:36.588
Donahue's bank accounts
have all been cleared.

33:36.664 --> 33:38.181
JT's still posted
at his apartment,

33:38.258 --> 33:39.966
but I think
our guy skipped town.

33:40.043 --> 33:42.519
And do we need to talk
about last night?

33:42.596 --> 33:44.179
Chabra's alive.

33:44.189 --> 33:46.347
And I was mostly sure
he was gonna be okay.

33:46.358 --> 33:48.400
Like... 72%.

33:50.270 --> 33:51.853
Donahue's a famous surgeon.

33:51.864 --> 33:53.521
Easily recognizable.

33:53.532 --> 33:56.366
So he has to know that making it
as a fugitive is unlikely.

33:56.443 --> 33:57.984
I know, but he's arrogant.

33:58.061 --> 33:59.486
-Maybe he's delusional.
-GIL: But not stupid.

33:59.562 --> 34:02.280
His picture's in every agency
across the country.

34:02.357 --> 34:04.282
He's never getting off
this island without us knowing.

34:04.359 --> 34:07.035
Okay, let's think this through.

34:07.046 --> 34:09.329
Put ourselves
in Donahue's headspace.

34:09.405 --> 34:11.539
That is a terrifying thought.

34:11.550 --> 34:13.666
Humor me.

34:13.743 --> 34:16.386
Uh, what's his move?

34:16.463 --> 34:18.722
He knows we're onto him.

34:18.799 --> 34:21.516
So his only shot
at a new life...

34:23.753 --> 34:25.303
...is a new face.

34:25.380 --> 34:27.764
You think Donahue's gonna get a
surgery before he hits the road?

34:27.841 --> 34:31.318
Yes, and I know
where he's gonna go to do it.

34:34.722 --> 34:36.523
I think it's unlocked.

34:36.599 --> 34:38.066
We still need a warrant.

34:38.077 --> 34:39.234
Even for consultants?

34:39.244 --> 34:41.402
(door thuds)

34:41.413 --> 34:43.747
There's something
leaning against the door.

34:43.824 --> 34:46.249
Take a look.

34:51.665 --> 34:54.382
It's one of the surgeons.
Push harder.

35:03.126 --> 35:05.435
He's alive.

35:08.607 --> 35:09.931
(woman moaning)

35:09.942 --> 35:11.108
BRIGHT:
Francine!

35:11.184 --> 35:12.725
FRANCINE:
That bitch.

35:12.778 --> 35:15.103
This is Powell.
I need backup at 1304 Park.

35:15.114 --> 35:16.396
What happened?

35:16.472 --> 35:18.273
Oh, Donahue's recovery nurse.

35:18.283 --> 35:21.067
The moment we put him under,
she went ballistic.

35:21.144 --> 35:22.953
-What nurse? What's her name?
-I don't know.

35:23.029 --> 35:25.113
A brunette. Blue eyes,

35:25.124 --> 35:26.948
five-five, 115 pounds.

35:26.959 --> 35:28.533
Teardrop Cs, if I had to guess.

35:28.610 --> 35:31.035
That's Summer.
Where are they now?

35:31.112 --> 35:32.120
In surgery.

35:32.131 --> 35:33.288
(man screams)

35:33.323 --> 35:34.631
That's not surgery.

35:34.708 --> 35:36.249
That's murder.

35:36.326 --> 35:38.593
(screaming continues)

35:45.310 --> 35:46.626
DANI:
Summer!

35:46.703 --> 35:49.437
Step away from the chair,
and put the needle down.

35:50.506 --> 35:52.140
I can't do that.

35:52.151 --> 35:53.266
Why are you doing this, Summer?

35:53.343 --> 35:55.318
You would never understand.

35:55.395 --> 35:57.729
BRIGHT:
Give me a chance.

35:57.805 --> 35:59.531
I might surprise you.

36:00.642 --> 36:03.151
I know a thing or two
about murder.

36:03.162 --> 36:05.245
Not like this.

36:09.242 --> 36:11.459
I guess you're right.

36:12.654 --> 36:14.379
Oh, and by the way...

36:15.340 --> 36:17.257
...it's nice
to finally meet you.

36:18.510 --> 36:20.260
Lana.

36:27.043 --> 36:30.854
Lana, put the needle down
and talk to us. We can help.

36:30.931 --> 36:32.263
No, you can't.

36:32.340 --> 36:34.232
-Bright, that's Lana?
-Yep.

36:34.267 --> 36:36.517
The brilliant young surgeon
Donahue disfigured.

36:36.528 --> 36:40.021
He told me after he
"fixed my bone structure,"

36:40.032 --> 36:42.690
I would be unstoppable.

36:42.701 --> 36:44.868
(quiet laugh)

36:44.945 --> 36:46.569
I lost my friends.

36:46.646 --> 36:48.196
My identity, everything.

36:48.207 --> 36:49.873
You're not disfigured.
You're beautiful.

36:49.950 --> 36:51.458
LANA:
Ignore the pretty face.

36:52.527 --> 36:54.160
The body can't tell
the difference

36:54.237 --> 36:56.213
between elective surgery
and a knife wound.

36:56.289 --> 36:59.716
Donahue nicked
my fifth cranial nerve.

36:59.793 --> 37:01.876
What does that mean?

37:01.887 --> 37:05.555
When you cut a nerve like that,
you create a neuroma.

37:05.632 --> 37:07.048
The more you try to fix it,

37:07.059 --> 37:09.059
the deeper and stronger
it grows back.

37:09.135 --> 37:10.635
LANA:
It's like an invisible,
white-hot pain

37:10.712 --> 37:13.012
that constantly runs like acid

37:13.089 --> 37:14.639
beneath this pretty face.

37:14.716 --> 37:17.234
BRIGHT:
It's enough to drive
anyone insane.

37:18.219 --> 37:19.903
This wasn't about beauty.

37:19.980 --> 37:21.187
It was about pain.

37:21.264 --> 37:24.115
It's about suffering.

37:26.578 --> 37:29.070
Whatever Zhang and Chabra felt,

37:29.081 --> 37:31.998
it is a fraction
of what I endure.

37:33.660 --> 37:36.077
Then why let Donahue off easy?

37:36.088 --> 37:37.912
What are you doing?

37:37.923 --> 37:40.924
She wants revenge.

37:41.001 --> 37:43.501
If you want to get even, Lana,

37:43.578 --> 37:45.253
get even.

37:45.264 --> 37:47.430
You've turned him
into everything that he hates.

37:47.507 --> 37:49.424
(Donahue whimpering)

37:49.434 --> 37:51.676
So let him live.

37:51.753 --> 37:53.561
Like this.

37:55.107 --> 37:57.515
A monster
who will wake up every day

37:57.592 --> 38:00.318
trapped in a nightmare.

38:02.138 --> 38:04.531
Unable to recognize himself
in a mirror.

38:06.142 --> 38:07.492
<i> Believe me.</i>

38:08.620 --> 38:11.121
I know.

38:11.814 --> 38:14.124
That's real pain.

38:17.820 --> 38:20.130
(quiet laugh)

38:34.462 --> 38:37.314
(handcuffs clicking)

38:37.390 --> 38:40.525
The best revenge is
letting him live like this.

38:48.017 --> 38:51.402
Oh, our gym rat's
not out of the woods,

38:51.479 --> 38:53.237
but he'll recover.

38:53.314 --> 38:55.239
Well, my quick thinking

38:55.316 --> 38:57.959
and your... steady hand.

38:58.861 --> 39:02.297
I wasn't expecting you to be
so savvy with a drill.

39:04.084 --> 39:07.260
Your fault
for underestimating me.

39:10.373 --> 39:13.224
Well, I could say
the same to you.

39:24.387 --> 39:27.238
Good night, Dr. Whitly.

39:29.368 --> 39:31.368
Let's go. Shift's over.

39:39.044 --> 39:41.252
(chuckles softly)

40:01.257 --> 40:04.350
So... did you figure it out?

40:04.427 --> 40:06.352
I did.

40:06.429 --> 40:10.240
And the DNA test I ran
on your shirt proved it.

40:11.559 --> 40:13.317
The blood was porcine.

40:13.394 --> 40:15.036
(chuckles)

40:17.490 --> 40:19.582
Pig's blood, Ainsley.

40:20.660 --> 40:22.919
-Really?
-Oh, come on.

40:22.996 --> 40:24.245
It was a little funny.

40:24.256 --> 40:27.090
This whole thing was
just a prank?

40:28.093 --> 40:30.093
Do you have any idea

40:30.170 --> 40:31.928
what you've put me through?

40:32.005 --> 40:33.504
Do you?

40:33.581 --> 40:36.266
You lied to me.

40:36.342 --> 40:38.384
Underestimated me for months!

40:38.461 --> 40:41.521
I have given up everything
for you!

40:44.184 --> 40:46.609
I... I don't even know

40:46.686 --> 40:49.353
who I am anymore.

40:49.430 --> 40:52.106
Because of what I have done

40:52.117 --> 40:54.066
to protect you.

40:54.143 --> 40:55.276
Protect me?

40:55.287 --> 40:57.120
Or control me?

41:00.366 --> 41:02.792
You know, for someone who spent
the last few decades

41:02.869 --> 41:06.037
trying to recover
from being gaslit,

41:06.113 --> 41:08.706
it's ironic how quickly
you resorted to it.

41:08.783 --> 41:10.249
That's not the same.

41:10.326 --> 41:12.760
I was trying to save you pain.

41:13.638 --> 41:16.139
That's exactly
what Dad would say.

41:27.727 --> 41:30.236
I'm sorry.

41:31.231 --> 41:33.064
I appreciate that.

41:33.140 --> 41:34.273
But...

41:34.350 --> 41:36.943
this whole thing was...

41:37.019 --> 41:38.569
completely deranged.

41:38.646 --> 41:39.996
You realize that, right?

41:40.073 --> 41:41.489
(chuckles)

41:41.500 --> 41:43.324
Okay. It was...

41:43.335 --> 41:46.002
a little over the top,
but I had to make sure

41:46.079 --> 41:48.505
that you were never gonna
mess with my head again.

41:49.365 --> 41:53.000
Seriously, though,
you need to lighten up.

41:53.011 --> 41:55.011
We got away with it.

41:55.088 --> 41:57.096
-You don't know that.
-Mm.

41:57.757 --> 41:58.965
I do.

41:59.041 --> 42:01.184
