00:59.894 --> 01:00.994
- I'm looking this way.

01:00.994 --> 01:01.850
I'm looking that way.

01:01.850 --> 01:02.858
You can look that way!

(lightning crackles)

01:03.977 --> 01:05.986

(toy squeaks)

01:06.914 --> 01:09.581

01:21.088 --> 01:23.959
(dog barking)

01:23.959 --> 01:26.199
Jenny, are you sure he's in there?

01:26.199 --> 01:28.948
- Yes, Carlos, I can
hear his bark from here!

01:28.948 --> 01:30.648
Wait, wait, wait, wait. Can't we just...

01:30.648 --> 01:31.873
...call for him from here

01:32.064 --> 01:32.897
And do what?!

01:32.897 --> 01:34.537
Wait for him to open the door?

01:34.537 --> 01:36.039
He's a dog.

01:36.039 --> 01:37.511
- [Carlos] Pit Bull!

01:37.511 --> 01:38.382
Goddammit!

01:38.382 --> 01:39.215
Babe, wait.

01:40.250 --> 01:41.083
Jeez.

01:41.083 --> 01:42.767
(door knob rattling)

01:42.767 --> 01:44.360
(loud thudding)
Babe!

01:44.360 --> 01:47.790
Babe, can't we get another
chihuahua and name him Pit Bull?

01:47.790 --> 01:48.930
- Babe!

01:48.930 --> 01:51.010
Wait, are you scared to go in there?

01:51.010 --> 01:51.881
- Who's scared?

01:51.881 --> 01:52.814
I'm not scared.

01:52.814 --> 01:55.640
- [Jenny] Big Latino macho
man is scared to go in there.

01:55.640 --> 01:57.815
- I am not, I'm not scared Jenny.

01:57.815 --> 02:00.473
You're scared, so let's
go, cause you're scared.

02:00.480 --> 02:01.820
Let's go! Babe!

02:01.820 --> 02:03.053
Oh, my god, wait.

02:04.110 --> 02:05.080
Wait, your hair!

02:05.322 --> 02:06.155
Jenny!

02:08.943 --> 02:09.776
Babe, wait!

02:11.443 --> 02:12.276
Babe!

02:14.860 --> 02:15.693
Babe!

02:16.798 --> 02:17.808
Babe!
- What?

02:17.808 --> 02:18.641
- Jesus.

02:19.416 --> 02:20.249
I don't know if you know, but that's

02:20.249 --> 02:22.574
the infamous Bradford House.

02:22.592 --> 02:24.549
- I don't know if you know,
but I don't care whose...

02:24.549 --> 02:25.382
... house that is.

02:25.382 --> 02:27.640
poor little Pit Bull's
in there all by himself!

02:27.673 --> 02:28.506
- Hey, why are you crying?

02:28.506 --> 02:30.017
You know I hate it when
you do that, don't cry!

02:30.017 --> 02:32.003
- How am I supposed to not cry, Carlos?!

02:32.003 --> 02:33.465
You don't love me anymore!

02:33.465 --> 02:34.298
- Oh!

02:34.298 --> 02:35.600
I don't love you anymore?!

02:35.600 --> 02:37.810
Why, because I refuse to
put our lives in danger

02:37.810 --> 02:39.330
by going into that house?!

02:39.330 --> 02:40.163
- Really, Carlos?!

02:40.163 --> 02:41.560
You believe all that nonsense?!

02:41.560 --> 02:42.890
- It's not nonsense, Jenny!
- Oh!

02:42.890 --> 02:44.330
- I've heard all the crazy stories!

02:44.330 --> 02:45.850
- Exactly, you heard stories,

02:45.850 --> 02:47.634
but you never actually experienced this!

02:47.634 --> 02:48.950
- And I don't want to, Jenny!

02:48.950 --> 02:50.920
Plus, we're two minorities,

02:50.920 --> 02:53.540
what good can happen
between two minorities

02:53.540 --> 02:55.510
by going into that house?!

02:55.510 --> 02:57.460
That's a recipe for a horror movie!

02:57.460 --> 02:59.377
Babe, wait, I'm coming!

03:01.698 --> 03:02.531
Jenny!

03:03.557 --> 03:04.390
Babe!

03:05.425 --> 03:06.258
Babe!

03:10.876 --> 03:11.709
Jenny!

03:12.635 --> 03:13.468
Babe!

03:15.256 --> 03:16.089
Babe!

03:17.317 --> 03:18.943
Jeez, where is this girl?

03:18.943 --> 03:20.959
- Carlos!
- Oh, my god!

03:20.959 --> 03:22.017
- Are you done?!
- You just gave me

03:22.017 --> 03:23.137
a heart attack!
- Come on!

03:23.137 --> 03:25.180
- [Carlos] Wait, wait, wait, wait, no, no!

03:25.180 --> 03:26.683
- All right, tell you what,

03:27.595 --> 03:30.671
if you go in there with me,
I'll give you a little treat.

03:30.671 --> 03:31.960
- A treat?
- Mm-hm.

03:31.960 --> 03:33.396
- Wait, what, what kind of treat?

03:33.396 --> 03:35.655
- I don't know, guess you'll
just have to find out.

03:35.655 --> 03:38.322
(Carlos groans)

03:39.720 --> 03:40.597
- Okay, fine!
- All right.

03:40.597 --> 03:42.232
- But if we die, I am not gonna be

03:42.232 --> 03:43.472
happy about this.
- Come on, don't be stupid!

03:43.472 --> 03:44.630
- Babe, babe, wait!
- We're not gonna die!

03:44.630 --> 03:48.053
- I'm coming, wait!
(lightning crackles)

03:50.493 --> 03:52.218
- See, it's not that spooky.

03:52.218 --> 03:53.618
- It is pretty spooky

03:53.618 --> 03:54.614
(door thuds)
- Oh, my god, Jenny!

03:54.614 --> 03:55.750
Pa' su madre! Let's go right now.

03:55.750 --> 03:57.557
- Babe, settle down!

03:57.557 --> 03:58.498
That was the wind.

03:58.498 --> 04:01.390
- Yeah, well, the wind is really angry.

04:01.390 --> 04:03.755
- Stop being a chicken,
help me find Pit Bull!

04:03.755 --> 04:05.054
- Okay.

04:05.054 --> 04:06.887
Wait, wait, slow down.

04:08.361 --> 04:10.498
(Jenny whistling)

04:10.498 --> 04:11.331
- Pit Bull.

04:11.331 --> 04:12.282
(Jenny smacking lips)

04:12.282 --> 04:13.327
Come here, boy--
(loud clattering)

04:13.327 --> 04:14.313
Did you hear that?

04:18.459 --> 04:21.500
- I want to say no, but yeah.

04:21.500 --> 04:22.400
Jenny?

04:22.400 --> 04:23.329
Where you going?
- Come here, boy.

04:23.329 --> 04:24.170
- Jenny, don't go up there.
(Jenny smacking lips)

04:24.170 --> 04:25.360
You're--
- Come on.

04:25.360 --> 04:26.808
- [Carlos] Jenny!

04:26.808 --> 04:30.010
No, babe, wait for me.
(Jenny whistling)

04:30.010 --> 04:31.130
Jesus.

04:31.130 --> 04:32.030
Do you see him?

04:32.030 --> 04:32.947
- Pit Bull.

04:33.821 --> 04:36.005
Come out, sweetie.

04:36.005 --> 04:39.022
(dog barking)

04:39.022 --> 04:39.855
Pit Bull.

04:43.086 --> 04:44.499
Come here, boy.

04:44.499 --> 04:46.564
(dog barking)

04:46.564 --> 04:47.397
(Jenny gasps)

04:47.397 --> 04:48.230
Pit Bull.

04:53.773 --> 04:56.680
(lamp crackles)
- Whoa.

04:56.680 --> 04:58.180
Babe, you got him?

05:00.103 --> 05:01.610
Babe, let's just get
out of here right now.

05:01.610 --> 05:02.443
Let's go.

05:03.550 --> 05:04.918
Come on, Jenny, let's go.

05:04.918 --> 05:07.172
- Carlos, what about your treat?

05:07.172 --> 05:08.005
- My what?

05:08.005 --> 05:09.493
What about my treat?

05:10.532 --> 05:11.583
No.

05:11.583 --> 05:13.389
Right here?
(Jenny chuckles)

05:13.389 --> 05:17.589
- Carlos, we're Latinos in their 20s,

05:17.935 --> 05:21.685
we live with our parents,
can never be alone,

05:23.372 --> 05:25.438
so, trick?

05:27.605 --> 05:28.438
Or treat?

05:29.165 --> 05:30.348
- So crazy.

05:30.348 --> 05:31.595
(Jenny chuckles)

05:31.595 --> 05:32.834
That's why I love you.

05:32.834 --> 05:33.667
Treat.

05:35.410 --> 05:37.993
(gentle music)

05:47.361 --> 05:50.940
- So what stories have you
heard about this place?

05:50.940 --> 05:52.186
- [Carlos] Mm-mm.

05:52.186 --> 05:53.477
- Tell me.
- Mm-mm.

05:53.477 --> 05:54.310
- Tell me.

05:55.459 --> 05:57.959
- Do you want to know?
- Mm-hm.

05:59.297 --> 06:00.716
- I heard there was a brother and a sister

06:00.716 --> 06:01.549
that used to live here.

06:01.549 --> 06:04.288
- Mm-hm.
- And they hated each other.

06:06.150 --> 06:09.975
And then one night, one
Halloween, the brother snapped!

06:09.975 --> 06:12.030
(lightning crackles)

06:12.030 --> 06:13.543
And cut his sister's head off.

06:15.040 --> 06:18.093
He felt so bad about what
he did that he hung himself.

06:19.206 --> 06:20.665
Yeah.

06:20.665 --> 06:22.915
(Jenny chuckles)

06:22.915 --> 06:26.540
- [Jenny] I can't believe you
believe all that nonsense.

06:26.540 --> 06:28.263
- It's not nonsense, Jenny.

06:29.163 --> 06:30.171
It's what happened, okay?

06:30.171 --> 06:31.004
- Mm-hm.

06:31.004 --> 06:32.420
(Jenny chuckles)

06:32.420 --> 06:33.932
You're cute when you're scared.

06:33.932 --> 06:35.116
(lighting crackles)

06:35.116 --> 06:36.802
(lamp buzzes)

06:36.802 --> 06:38.855
(Jenny chuckles)

06:38.855 --> 06:41.605
(dog whimpering)

06:42.984 --> 06:45.314
(Jenny gasps)
- Babe, babe, oh, my god!

06:45.314 --> 06:49.842
(loud thud)
(both scream)

06:49.842 --> 06:52.759
(mysterious music)

07:10.754 --> 07:13.004
(knocking)

07:15.039 --> 07:17.430
- [Grandma Juana] Oh, you're finally here!

07:17.430 --> 07:19.055
- [Nelson] Hi Mom, how are you?

07:19.055 --> 07:20.113
- Hi my love, hi.

07:20.113 --> 07:20.946
- [Gaby] Hello Juana.

07:20.946 --> 07:21.779
- Welcome, come in, come in.

07:21.779 --> 07:23.454
- Hi darling.

07:23.979 --> 07:25.387
- Oh, how cute!

07:25.920 --> 07:27.336
- Be careful.

07:27.336 --> 07:28.736
- Hi, my love.

07:29.403 --> 07:31.569
- What are you doing? Help your dad.

07:31.569 --> 07:32.977
- You're both old enough.

07:32.977 --> 07:33.993
- [Nora] I have anxiety.

07:34.077 --> 07:37.735
- Anxiety! Anxiety at ten?
Get outta here with that.

07:37.735 --> 07:39.476
- Come in, my love, come in.

07:39.476 --> 07:42.234
- I made some food that
you're going to love.

07:46.962 --> 07:49.060
- Grandma, your picadillo the best.

07:49.060 --> 07:52.426
- Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you. .

07:52.668 --> 07:55.767
- I'm glad these kids
came out intelligent.

07:55.767 --> 07:57.158
- Like their Grandmother.

07:57.158 --> 07:59.833
- Enjoy it because this is real food.

07:59.833 --> 08:02.770
Not that stuff you guys eat
of hotdogs and hamburgers.

08:02.770 --> 08:03.603
- Just ignore her.

08:03.603 --> 08:04.801
We're only here for a few weeks.

08:04.801 --> 08:07.442
- Mm.
Mom, the food is delicious.

08:07.625 --> 08:09.100
- You want more? There's more.

08:09.100 --> 08:10.525
- [Nelson] No. No, I'm full.

08:10.525 --> 08:11.916
- [Grandma Juana] Okay, good.

08:11.916 --> 08:15.141
Don't eat anymore, that
way you won't get fat.

08:15.141 --> 08:16.350
(Gaby chuckles)

08:16.350 --> 08:19.670
- Don't worry, we're only
gonna be here for a few weeks.

08:19.670 --> 08:20.503
Remember?

08:24.157 --> 08:26.643
- So Mom, how have you been?

08:26.643 --> 08:27.485
(Juana sighs)

08:27.485 --> 08:30.826
- How do you expect me
to be, son? I don't know.

08:32.735 --> 08:37.735
- After your father's
death, I feel so alone.

08:38.760 --> 08:40.092
- I miss abuelo.

08:43.070 --> 08:44.711
- [Juana] I miss him too.

08:47.753 --> 08:51.778
- But anyway, now I have
you guys here with me...

08:51.778 --> 08:54.652
- ...and I'm sure we're going
to have an amazing weekend.

08:54.660 --> 08:56.493
- We're going to have so much fun.

08:57.292 --> 08:58.125
- Jorge?

08:58.508 --> 08:59.341
- Oh.

09:01.093 --> 09:03.230
- You know how we're gonna
be here this weekend?

09:03.230 --> 09:06.790
Well, we're actually
gonna be here this weekend

09:06.790 --> 09:09.530
and every other weekend.

09:09.530 --> 09:11.588
- Nelsito, wait a moment.

09:11.588 --> 09:14.246
- Can you explain, my
love? What do you mean?

09:14.250 --> 09:17.251
- Juana, we are moving to Miami.

09:17.251 --> 09:18.084
- What?

09:19.092 --> 09:19.925
- No?

09:20.225 --> 09:24.600
- After Dad passed away, we
knew you couldn't be alone.

09:24.966 --> 09:28.340
- And we knew you weren't
going to move to California

09:28.340 --> 09:31.440
with us and this house mean a lot to you.

09:31.440 --> 09:36.439
- Yes, but what about your
jobs? And school for the Kids?

09:37.192 --> 09:39.116
- Everything has been taken care of.

09:39.116 --> 09:40.524
We both found jobs,

09:40.524 --> 09:43.510
and Jorge and Nora start school tomorrow.

09:43.510 --> 09:45.901
- [Nora] Now you have us forever, Grandma.

09:45.901 --> 09:49.300
- How wonderful! Thank
you our lady of charity.

09:49.300 --> 09:52.043
- Thank you, thank you
for this beautiful gift.

09:52.043 --> 09:55.309
- And we also bought a house near here.

09:55.309 --> 09:56.142
- [Juana] Really?

09:56.142 --> 09:58.633
- Yes. It's abandoned so it
needs a little bit of work.

09:58.633 --> 10:00.120
but if it's okay if we can stay here

10:00.120 --> 10:01.822
for a couple of weeks while we fix it up?

10:01.822 --> 10:02.655
- Of course.

10:02.655 --> 10:07.655
- You're more than welcome to
stay here as long as you need.

10:07.663 --> 10:08.496
- This is your home.

10:09.621 --> 10:12.262
- So tell me, where's the house?

10:12.262 --> 10:13.095
- It's a couple of blocks away from here.

10:13.095 --> 10:14.510
The Bradford house?

10:14.510 --> 10:15.910
(gasps)
- No!

10:15.910 --> 10:17.885
No! No! You're crazy!

10:17.885 --> 10:19.143
- Why, Mom?

10:19.143 --> 10:20.618
- [Juana] What do you mean, "why?!"

10:20.618 --> 10:22.800
- You guys can't live there.

10:22.800 --> 10:24.625
- That house is haunted, it has demons!

10:24.625 --> 10:25.909
- What is she talking about?

10:25.909 --> 10:27.542
- [Juana] What do you mean,
"what am I talking about?"

10:27.542 --> 10:30.758
- Everybody knows about it.
Everybody. It's haunted.

10:30.760 --> 10:32.301
You bought a haunted house?

10:32.301 --> 10:33.497
- You bought a haunted house?

10:33.497 --> 10:35.220
- Jorge, put the phone down.

10:35.220 --> 10:37.083
Listen, she doesn't know
what she's talking about.

10:37.083 --> 10:39.658
- What do you mean "I don't
know what I'm talking about?!"

10:39.658 --> 10:40.491
of course I know!

10:40.600 --> 10:41.940
- Listen to me.

10:41.940 --> 10:43.970
Listen to me.

10:43.970 --> 10:47.220
That house has been abandoned
for many, many years.

10:47.220 --> 10:48.500
You know why?

10:48.500 --> 10:51.373
Because every time somebody
wants to live there,

10:51.373 --> 10:55.206
they run right out, because
it's full of demons, haunted.

10:56.390 --> 10:57.330
It's haunted.

10:57.330 --> 10:58.163
Haunted!

10:59.770 --> 11:01.170
Haunted house.

11:01.170 --> 11:04.369
- [Nora] Dad, I want to
go back to California.

11:04.369 --> 11:05.585
- Mom, you're scaring her.

11:05.585 --> 11:06.630
- No.

11:06.630 --> 11:07.463
- [Nelson] Gosh, it's okay.

11:07.463 --> 11:09.250
There's no demons there.

11:09.250 --> 11:11.500
- Did the realtor mention
any of this to you?

11:13.575 --> 11:15.336
- [Juana] Mm.

11:15.336 --> 11:16.950
- How do you mention a four-bedroom,

11:16.950 --> 11:19.630
two-bathroom house with
a double car garage,

11:19.630 --> 11:22.010
a big backyard, and maybe ghosts?

11:22.010 --> 11:24.170
- Listen, I don't believe
in any of that, okay?

11:24.170 --> 11:25.720
Have you seen a ghost?

11:25.720 --> 11:27.320
Have you seen a ghost?

11:27.320 --> 11:28.153
No.

11:28.153 --> 11:29.500
Exactly, thank you.

11:29.500 --> 11:32.040
- I've never seen a ghost,
and you want to know why?

11:32.040 --> 11:35.630
Because I've never lived
in a haunted house.

11:35.630 --> 11:38.413
- [Nelson] Well enough, we
already bought the house.

11:38.538 --> 11:40.946
- And mom, I bought it
because it was the only

11:40.946 --> 11:42.462
one we could afford.

11:42.462 --> 11:44.720
- And to be close to you.

11:46.380 --> 11:47.500
- Babe, I'm sorry.

11:47.500 --> 11:48.870
I know you're really stressed out,

11:48.870 --> 11:51.358
and you don't any of this right now.

11:51.358 --> 11:52.191
- Forgive me, my love.

11:52.191 --> 11:57.183
- I know everything you do,
you do it thinking of others.

11:58.150 --> 12:01.100
- Now, let's finish
our food, let's unpack.

12:01.100 --> 12:02.910
Tomorrow you guys have class.

12:02.910 --> 12:05.263
We'll go by the house in
the morning, start work.

12:07.515 --> 12:08.515
- Excuse me.

12:11.423 --> 12:14.006
(gentle music)

12:19.165 --> 12:21.915
(phone clicking)

12:27.558 --> 12:28.837
Santo?

12:28.837 --> 12:31.276
Santo, it's me Juana Rodriguez.

12:31.276 --> 12:32.480
Yes.

12:32.480 --> 12:36.063
I need you to pick me
up tomorrow at 7:00 a.m.

12:36.063 --> 12:38.363
- At seven in the morning, Santo.

12:38.908 --> 12:43.325
Yes. We have to do a spiritual cleansing.

12:43.899 --> 12:45.079
Okay.

12:50.064 --> 12:51.092
Hello?

12:51.092 --> 12:53.654
(chuckles)

12:53.654 --> 12:54.487
Hello.

12:56.232 --> 12:57.065
Hello

12:58.453 --> 13:00.036
Hello, hello, hello.

13:02.152 --> 13:02.985
Hello.

13:04.929 --> 13:05.762
Oh.

13:05.762 --> 13:07.217
Santo.

13:07.217 --> 13:08.697
Santo come in.

13:08.697 --> 13:09.530
Come on.

13:10.722 --> 13:11.555
- Come in.

13:15.152 --> 13:19.002
- So this is the famous Bradford house?

13:19.002 --> 13:20.085
Yes it is.

13:21.055 --> 13:24.888
- And unfortunately, my
son decided to buy it.

13:26.271 --> 13:27.104
(loud Stomp)

13:28.270 --> 13:29.830
- What, what, what happened?

13:29.830 --> 13:30.906
- Santo what was that?

13:30.906 --> 13:33.564
- There are bad spirits in this house.

13:35.181 --> 13:36.564
- We have to start.

13:54.297 --> 13:56.805
- [Juana] Santo, what are you doing?

13:56.805 --> 13:58.855
- Is this a cleansing or a bakery?

13:58.855 --> 14:00.654
- [Santo] I'm starving, lady,
I haven't had breakfast.

14:00.654 --> 14:02.429
- You can have breakfast after.

14:02.429 --> 14:05.320
- We have to finish
before my son gets here.

14:05.320 --> 14:06.153
- Please.

14:06.153 --> 14:06.986
- Okay.

14:08.278 --> 14:09.111
- C'mon.

14:28.219 --> 14:29.052
- Oh yes.

14:42.091 --> 14:44.508
(loud stomp)

14:47.316 --> 14:49.733
(loud stomp)

14:54.223 --> 14:55.543
- What is going on here?

14:55.543 --> 14:57.410
- I think that guy's a chef.

14:57.410 --> 14:58.243
- [Chris] Wait, wait, wait,

14:58.243 --> 14:59.550
I know exactly what they're doing.

14:59.550 --> 15:01.453
It's called a despojo.

15:01.453 --> 15:02.580
- [Christy] A what?

15:02.580 --> 15:05.570
- [Chris] Some spiritual
cleansing of bad spirits.

15:05.570 --> 15:06.503
- There's bad spirits in this house?

15:06.503 --> 15:07.336
Where?

15:09.743 --> 15:10.576
Oh.

15:12.737 --> 15:13.637
- Juana.

15:13.637 --> 15:16.262
Juana. You stand here.

15:18.446 --> 15:19.550
(film projector clicking)

15:19.550 --> 15:21.456
- Oh, it's about to start.

15:21.456 --> 15:23.085
- Is this diet?

15:23.085 --> 15:25.819
- Santo, why do you have
to put me in this circle?

15:25.819 --> 15:27.852
- Because you are the connection

15:27.852 --> 15:30.194
Between your family and this house.

15:30.213 --> 15:31.046
Okay.

15:32.776 --> 15:36.276
(film projector clicking)

15:38.444 --> 15:39.277
- Santo please.

15:41.569 --> 15:42.402
- Santo please.

15:43.060 --> 15:43.893
- Santo please.

15:57.650 --> 15:59.587
- So, this is supposed to get rid of us?

15:59.587 --> 16:00.950
'Cause I could sit here all day

16:00.950 --> 16:02.006
and watch the old lady suffer.

16:02.006 --> 16:02.839
- Quiet.

16:02.839 --> 16:03.903
Now it's where it gets good.

16:04.848 --> 16:05.747
- It gets better than this?

16:05.747 --> 16:06.580
- Yeah.

16:24.789 --> 16:26.847
- What are you going
to do with these eggs?

16:26.847 --> 16:27.990
- [Santo] Shh.

16:28.431 --> 16:29.264
- Okay.

16:32.683 --> 16:35.851
- I think it's time for us
to start a show of our own.

16:35.851 --> 16:38.110
- I don't know because this
is a tough act to follow.

16:38.110 --> 16:40.220
- See, this is why we're never
gonna be in show business.

16:40.220 --> 16:41.770
You have zero confidence in us.

16:43.216 --> 16:44.795
(lamp buzzing)

16:44.795 --> 16:47.395
- Ah, Santo, what is that?

16:47.395 --> 16:48.228
- What?

16:48.228 --> 16:49.061
- What happened to that light?

16:49.061 --> 16:49.894
- [Santo] What?

16:49.894 --> 16:50.727
- Oh, Santo.

16:50.727 --> 16:52.643
- [Santo] No, it wasn't me! It was you!

16:52.643 --> 16:53.476
- It was you.

16:53.476 --> 16:54.309
- No, it was you!

16:54.309 --> 16:55.142
- It wasn't me.

16:55.142 --> 16:55.975
- [Juana] I'm scared!

16:55.975 --> 16:56.808
- I'm scared too!

16:56.808 --> 16:57.858
(electricity crackling)

16:57.858 --> 16:58.937
- Juana!

16:58.937 --> 17:00.126
Juana!

17:00.126 --> 17:01.832
(door slams)
(Juana screams)

17:01.832 --> 17:04.106
(both screaming)

17:04.106 --> 17:06.689
(wind blowing)

17:09.585 --> 17:12.167
(light buzzes)

17:15.594 --> 17:17.689
(Juana shrieks)

17:17.689 --> 17:19.608
(soft rattling)

17:19.608 --> 17:22.996
(both yelping)

17:22.996 --> 17:25.020
- [Juana] Let's go, let's go, let's go.

17:25.020 --> 17:27.603
(both yelping)

17:28.730 --> 17:29.570
- Hey, thanks for the show.

17:29.570 --> 17:30.830
It was eggcellent!

17:30.830 --> 17:33.052
- Yeah, you guys crack me up.

17:33.052 --> 17:34.300
(laughs)
- Make sure to get some rest.

17:34.300 --> 17:36.280
You must be eggshausted.

17:36.280 --> 17:38.860
- Hey, why are you guys eggnoring us?

17:38.860 --> 17:40.780
- I guess they don't like our yolks.

17:40.780 --> 17:45.170
- Wow, that entire exchange
of egg puns is really bad.

17:45.170 --> 17:47.453
- Yeah, it eggscalated quickly.

17:48.340 --> 17:49.360
What? That was good.

17:50.490 --> 17:52.490
(sighs)

17:55.760 --> 17:58.110
- We're actually gonna
be here this weekend

17:58.110 --> 18:00.329
and every other weekend.

18:00.329 --> 18:02.195
- And school for the kids?

18:02.195 --> 18:04.353
- [Juana] I know what I'm
talking about, of course I know.

18:04.353 --> 18:05.290
- Haunted!

18:05.290 --> 18:06.123
Haunted!

18:11.393 --> 18:14.310
(mysterious music)

18:19.791 --> 18:22.210
- [Chris] Looks like we
got some more company.

18:22.210 --> 18:23.110
- [Christy] Again?

18:24.910 --> 18:26.350
What's going on this week?

18:48.054 --> 18:50.721
(loud thudding)

18:53.204 --> 18:54.037
Come on.

18:54.037 --> 18:54.870
- Get off me.

19:00.000 --> 19:00.974
- [Nelson] It's awesome right?

19:00.974 --> 19:03.622
(Jorge groans)
Look at the size of this yard.

19:03.622 --> 19:05.440
Come on, imagine the
landscaping right there.

19:05.440 --> 19:07.787
A fountain right over there on the left.

19:07.787 --> 19:09.100
- [Gaby] No, you're not putting a fountain

19:09.100 --> 19:10.660
in the front yard.

19:10.660 --> 19:12.010
- Well, at least he's cute.

19:13.767 --> 19:15.520
- I don't think he's really your type.

19:15.520 --> 19:17.840
- Oh, yeah, and what's his type?

19:17.840 --> 19:20.133
- I don't know, alive?

19:21.820 --> 19:22.653
- [Nora] What are you doing?

19:22.653 --> 19:24.593
- Got to get some ghosts on camera.

19:25.970 --> 19:28.390
- You're gonna catch a fist
on camera if you don't stop.

19:28.390 --> 19:30.451
- [Jorge] What's wrong, Ma, you scared?

19:30.451 --> 19:34.368
Jorge Antonio Rodriguez,
don't push my buttons.

19:34.868 --> 19:36.336
(mailbox squeaks)

19:36.336 --> 19:38.400
- Dad, Jorge broke the mailbox!

19:38.400 --> 19:39.233
- Shut up, Nora.

19:39.233 --> 19:40.620
- I was gonna replace it anyways.

19:42.498 --> 19:44.092
Come on, let's check it out.

19:44.092 --> 19:45.650
(soft squishing)

19:45.650 --> 19:48.060
What happened here?

19:48.060 --> 19:49.583
- This is disgusting.

19:55.320 --> 19:57.724
- [Nelson] It's probably some kids.

19:57.724 --> 19:58.557
- Or a ghost.

20:00.150 --> 20:02.460
- These were not kids.

20:02.460 --> 20:04.170
These were Santeros.

20:04.170 --> 20:05.540
- [Nora] What are Santeros?

20:05.540 --> 20:07.560
- People who believe in Santa Claus.

20:07.560 --> 20:09.410
- Well, then I'm a Santero,

20:09.410 --> 20:11.560
and my people should never do this.

20:11.560 --> 20:13.173
- [Gaby] Don't believe your brother, Nora.

20:14.309 --> 20:16.948
- [Nelson] C'mon, let
me show you the kitchen.

20:16.948 --> 20:18.928
- [Nelson] Come on, this is great.

20:18.928 --> 20:21.511
(gentle music)

20:31.113 --> 20:32.030
- Oh, sick.

20:34.532 --> 20:37.199
(loud creaking)

20:44.544 --> 20:46.377
There's nothing there.

20:47.414 --> 20:48.494
There's nothing there.

20:48.494 --> 20:51.161
(ominous music)

20:56.174 --> 20:58.200
(yelps)

20:58.200 --> 20:59.593
Scared the crap out of me, man!

20:59.593 --> 21:01.393
- Looks like you found your bedroom.

21:01.848 --> 21:04.970
If you need to change your
pants, the bathroom's over there.

21:04.970 --> 21:06.992
- Yeah, yeah, everybody's got jokes.

21:06.992 --> 21:10.409
(both mockingly chuckle)

21:12.389 --> 21:13.700
- I like this family.

21:13.700 --> 21:14.960
They're fun.

21:14.960 --> 21:17.000
- Yeah, a blast.

21:17.000 --> 21:19.020
- What's wrong with you?

21:19.020 --> 21:21.340
- Honestly, I'm just tired of
having to scare families away

21:21.340 --> 21:22.840
every time a new one comes around.

21:22.840 --> 21:25.693
- Well, maybe these are the ones.

21:26.880 --> 21:28.880
- No one will ever be the ones, Christy.

21:30.330 --> 21:31.623
No one deserves to live here.

21:57.930 --> 22:00.640
- Hey, is it cool if I walked
to Abuela's after school?

22:00.640 --> 22:02.240
It's not even too far from here.

22:03.840 --> 22:05.312
- [Gaby] Okay.

22:05.312 --> 22:08.039
But go directly to your
Grandmother's house.

22:08.039 --> 22:09.397
- Okay, okay.

22:09.397 --> 22:12.600
- [Nelson] And be sure
to make some friends!

22:12.600 --> 22:13.569
- Okay, Dad.

22:13.569 --> 22:15.448
- Yeah, loser!

22:15.448 --> 22:17.363
- Don't put your hand--
- He needs friends.

22:20.152 --> 22:23.040
(school bell rings)

22:23.040 --> 22:24.850
- Settle down, take your seats!

22:24.850 --> 22:25.890
Take your seats!

22:25.890 --> 22:26.723
What is this?!

22:26.723 --> 22:28.960
What are you, why is
this appropriate to you?!

22:28.960 --> 22:31.120
Sit down, you hooligans.

22:31.120 --> 22:32.360
Don't any of you have mothers?

22:32.360 --> 22:33.540
You're late!

22:33.540 --> 22:34.520
Down now.

22:34.520 --> 22:36.078
Go, go, go, go.

22:36.078 --> 22:38.310
(students chattering)

22:38.310 --> 22:39.623
Shut up!

22:40.860 --> 22:42.150
Thank you.

22:42.150 --> 22:45.770
Now that you guys look like
you're in the mode to learn,

22:45.770 --> 22:49.870
I have several announcements
that will pre-date that.

22:49.870 --> 22:53.090
The first announcement, we
have a brand new student.

22:53.090 --> 22:55.660
Jorge Rodriguez, would
you please stand up?

22:55.660 --> 22:57.120
Introduce yourself to the class

22:57.120 --> 22:59.620
and talk about what you'd
like to accomplish here.

23:02.530 --> 23:04.330
- Um, hey, guys.

23:04.330 --> 23:06.190
My name is Jorge Rodriguez.

23:06.190 --> 23:08.420
I moved here from California to Miami,

23:08.420 --> 23:10.100
to take care of my grandma,

23:10.100 --> 23:12.130
and we just bought a house
not too far from here.

23:12.130 --> 23:13.050
We're trying to fix it up

23:13.050 --> 23:15.590
'cause it's been abandoned for some time.

23:15.590 --> 23:19.300
I look forward to making new friends,

23:19.300 --> 23:22.260
joining some clubs,
and having a good time.

23:22.260 --> 23:23.870
- Yeah, friends and clubs, that's cool.

23:23.870 --> 23:25.230
What else do you want to do?

23:25.230 --> 23:27.713
Like, in an educational environment.

23:29.781 --> 23:30.614
- I don't know yet--

23:30.614 --> 23:31.780
- I don't know, what are some things

23:31.780 --> 23:35.360
that children do in a
classroom, Mr. Rodriguez?

23:35.360 --> 23:37.940
Maybe words that start with an L?

23:37.940 --> 23:42.030
Oh, oh, learn?

23:42.030 --> 23:43.810
- Learning, yes, of course.

23:43.810 --> 23:45.240
- Of course, learning, great.

23:45.240 --> 23:46.530
Okay, why don't you sit down?

23:46.530 --> 23:47.363
- Okay.

23:48.230 --> 23:50.670
- Now, everybody, get into your computers,

23:50.670 --> 23:52.020
put the code into your browser,

23:52.020 --> 23:54.820
and we're gonna start with
basic concepts of JavaScript.

24:10.420 --> 24:11.740
- Hey, yo, Jorge.

24:11.740 --> 24:12.940
Yo, Jorge, what's Gucci?

24:14.290 --> 24:15.360
- What's Gucci?

24:15.360 --> 24:16.970
- Yeah, man.

24:16.970 --> 24:17.803
- The clothing brand?

24:17.803 --> 24:21.420
- No, that's like saying what's
good, you know, what's up?

24:21.420 --> 24:22.310
- Oh.

24:22.310 --> 24:23.170
Right.

24:23.170 --> 24:24.723
- My name's Guillermo,
but they call me Guille,

24:24.723 --> 24:26.430
with my crew, Mark and Rob.

24:26.430 --> 24:28.141
- [Both] What's up?

24:28.141 --> 24:30.760
(school bell rings)

24:30.760 --> 24:32.200
- [Jorge] Nice meeting you guys.

24:34.510 --> 24:36.100
- You know, we heard you talk
about that abandoned house.

24:36.100 --> 24:38.630
By any chance that's the Bradford house?

24:38.630 --> 24:40.160
- Yeah, actually, it is.

24:40.160 --> 24:42.540
- Oh, man, that's crazy.

24:42.540 --> 24:44.570
- You do know about that house, right?

24:44.570 --> 24:46.760
- What, that it's haunted?

24:46.760 --> 24:47.810
Yeah.

24:47.810 --> 24:50.690
- Well, have you, you know, seen anything?

24:50.690 --> 24:51.950
- Yeah, like, apparitions maybe?

24:51.950 --> 24:53.680
- Like, ghosts?

24:53.680 --> 24:55.150
Nah, man.
- Oh, okay, cool.

24:55.150 --> 24:56.500
- Look, well, you know,
Halloween's coming up

24:56.500 --> 24:58.270
in a couple of days, I
think it'd be pretty cool

24:58.270 --> 25:00.520
if you were to throw a
Halloween party there.

25:01.812 --> 25:03.020
- I don't know about that.

25:03.020 --> 25:05.080
I mean, like, the whole place is a wreck.

25:05.080 --> 25:06.230
There's spiderwebs everywhere.

25:06.230 --> 25:07.450
It's not even done
being painted, you know?

25:07.450 --> 25:09.240
- Well, that's even
better, it's authentic.

25:09.240 --> 25:10.730
- Duh.
- No need for decorations.

25:10.730 --> 25:11.563
- Exactly.

25:12.640 --> 25:14.030
- Yeah, but my parents would never even

25:14.030 --> 25:15.870
allow that to happen.
- Wow, your parents.

25:15.870 --> 25:17.970
- Well, who says they need to know?

25:17.970 --> 25:20.000
Look, man, you're new here, right?

25:20.000 --> 25:21.800
What's the best way to make friends?

25:25.310 --> 25:27.610
Throw the biggest Halloween party ever.

25:27.610 --> 25:28.453
Ever.

25:29.710 --> 25:31.450
What better place to
throw a Halloween party

25:31.450 --> 25:32.500
than a haunted house?

25:35.210 --> 25:36.210
- I don't know, man.

25:37.550 --> 25:39.480
- Look, man, one of the things you said

25:39.480 --> 25:42.030
you were looking forward
to having was fun, right?

25:42.030 --> 25:44.453
Halloween party equals F-U-N, fun.

25:45.480 --> 25:46.997
Well, think about it.

25:46.997 --> 25:48.414
- Think about it.

25:57.848 --> 26:00.765
(mysterious music)

26:06.099 --> 26:09.304
- Jenny, I told you I never
wanted to come back here again.

26:09.304 --> 26:11.254
- You think I'm not going to do anything

26:11.262 --> 26:13.062
after what happened last night.

26:13.062 --> 26:13.895
- You're crazy.

26:13.895 --> 26:14.853
- No, you're crazy.

26:14.853 --> 26:16.330
- Don't call me crazy, Carlos.

26:16.330 --> 26:17.658
- Babe.

26:17.658 --> 26:18.491
- Look.

26:18.491 --> 26:19.408
- Here they come.

26:20.909 --> 26:23.492
(mellow music)

26:27.920 --> 26:31.650
- Hi, I'm Jenny, the one
that called you guys.

26:31.650 --> 26:32.550
- [Carlos] Carlos.

26:34.150 --> 26:35.730
- Max.

26:35.730 --> 26:36.563
- Willy.

26:37.680 --> 26:39.240
- Okay, well, this is the place here.

26:39.240 --> 26:40.480
We live a few houses down,

26:40.480 --> 26:42.110
and we don't want the ghosts

26:42.110 --> 26:44.670
terrorizing our neighborhood, so.

26:44.670 --> 26:46.680
- Yeah, there's a lot of crazy,

26:46.680 --> 26:48.240
wicked stuff going on inside, guys,

26:48.240 --> 26:50.683
so, you know, just try
to be careful, okay?

26:52.100 --> 26:53.593
- I don't know how to do that.

26:55.600 --> 26:56.433
- Do what?

27:00.700 --> 27:01.533
- Be careful.

27:04.060 --> 27:06.641
- Okay, well, um, oh.
- Check it out.

27:06.641 --> 27:10.830
- Okay, well, um, well, we're gonna go.

27:10.830 --> 27:12.951
If you need anything, just--

27:12.951 --> 27:13.784
- [Carlos] Let's go.

27:13.784 --> 27:15.560
- Or you can just ignore me.

27:15.560 --> 27:17.000
That's fine too, I don't care!

27:17.000 --> 27:18.695
I don't care, did they just ignore me?

27:18.695 --> 27:19.985
You can't ignore me!

27:19.985 --> 27:20.963
- [Jenny] Don't ignore me!

27:20.963 --> 27:22.213
- [Jenny] Don't touch me!

27:36.752 --> 27:39.419
(ominous music)

27:42.790 --> 27:44.170
- Willy!

27:44.170 --> 27:45.053
Today!

27:48.904 --> 27:51.010
- [Chris] What in God's name is that?

27:51.010 --> 27:52.741
- [Christy] What is it?

27:52.741 --> 27:53.574
- Huh.

27:55.507 --> 27:56.973
Check out their car.

27:57.940 --> 27:59.563
- Miami Paranormal Hunters.

28:00.600 --> 28:02.233
We don't bust 'em, we hunt 'em.

28:03.220 --> 28:04.373
They're gonna hunt us?

28:05.510 --> 28:06.460
Cool!

28:06.460 --> 28:08.267
- I know, right?

28:18.968 --> 28:21.551
(camera beeps)

28:30.457 --> 28:33.707
(door handle rattling)

28:38.970 --> 28:41.887
(mysterious music)

28:43.877 --> 28:46.544
(door creaking)

29:18.077 --> 29:19.980
- You're gonna invite us in,

29:19.980 --> 29:24.383
and not even have the decency
to come out and say hello?

29:26.241 --> 29:28.577
- "Welcome."

29:28.577 --> 29:30.893
- Very, very rude.

29:39.929 --> 29:40.762
- Ahem.

29:47.400 --> 29:49.203
Now we can do this the hard way,

29:50.177 --> 29:54.407
or we can do this the Max way.

29:56.880 --> 30:00.144
Either way, you're screwed.

30:00.144 --> 30:02.227
(laughs)

30:04.810 --> 30:05.763
You see this here?

30:07.960 --> 30:12.920
This is the EGZ 3000,
the Electro Ghost Zapper,

30:12.920 --> 30:16.030
designed by yours truly.

30:16.030 --> 30:17.720
- [Willy] Nicely done, sir.

30:17.720 --> 30:19.183
- Thank you very much, Willy.

30:20.520 --> 30:23.820
Now I don't want to have
to use the EGZ 3000,

30:23.820 --> 30:26.840
well, actually, I do
'cause I can go for some

30:26.840 --> 30:28.803
ghost toast and butter right about now.

30:28.803 --> 30:30.500
(both laugh)

30:30.500 --> 30:34.460
But I won't, if you come
on out and play nice.

30:35.914 --> 30:38.331
(loud creak)

30:42.700 --> 30:43.947
Did you hear that?

30:44.965 --> 30:47.177
- [Willy] Yes, sir.

30:47.177 --> 30:50.253
Maybe we should go investigate?

30:51.367 --> 30:53.022
- Uh.

30:53.022 --> 30:55.930
(loud creak)

30:55.930 --> 30:56.763
Okay.

30:58.020 --> 30:59.140
- Okay.
- Yeah.

30:59.140 --> 31:02.523
Yeah, that's a good idea, Willy.

31:03.866 --> 31:05.790
Do you want to maybe
get like, a bite to eat

31:05.790 --> 31:07.220
before we go upstairs, or...

31:08.983 --> 31:13.370
- [Willy] Well, yes, I'm kind of hungry.

31:13.370 --> 31:14.430
- Okay, good, so--

31:14.430 --> 31:18.357
- [Willy] But maybe we
should go investigate.

31:19.214 --> 31:20.047
- Yeah, no, no, you're right

31:20.047 --> 31:22.259
'cause that's what we do, we're--

31:22.259 --> 31:23.900
- Investigators!
- Right, right.

31:23.900 --> 31:25.080
(chuckles)

31:25.080 --> 31:26.330
We investigate.

31:28.992 --> 31:31.659
(ominous music)

32:11.174 --> 32:13.674
(tense music)

32:18.893 --> 32:23.482
- It's only gerbil.
(gerbil squeaking)

32:23.482 --> 32:25.940
(Max sighs)

32:25.940 --> 32:28.540
- Nice job, ghost, huh?

32:28.540 --> 32:31.203
The old noise by a rodent routine.

32:32.070 --> 32:35.060
Classic ghost strategy.

32:35.060 --> 32:36.510
- [Willy] They can't fool us.

32:37.368 --> 32:39.037
(gerbil squeaking)

32:39.037 --> 32:40.677
(Max yelping)

32:40.677 --> 32:41.510
- It's in my pants!

32:41.510 --> 32:43.116
Oh, it's in my pants!

32:43.116 --> 32:43.949
It's in my pants!

32:43.949 --> 32:45.070
Willy, it's in my pants!

32:45.070 --> 32:45.903
Get it off!

32:45.903 --> 32:47.182
Get it off!

32:47.182 --> 32:48.189
(screams)

32:48.189 --> 32:49.162
Get it, get it!

32:49.162 --> 32:50.561
Get it off me!

32:50.561 --> 32:51.394
Get it off!

32:51.394 --> 32:52.657
Get it off, Willy!

32:52.657 --> 32:53.817
Get it off!
- Hey, hey, hey!

32:53.817 --> 32:56.080
- What's going on here?!

32:56.080 --> 32:56.913
- Get out of here, kid!

32:56.913 --> 32:57.746
We're working!

32:57.746 --> 32:58.723
- Yeah, we're busy! Scram!

32:58.723 --> 33:00.270
- I'm not getting out of here!

33:00.270 --> 33:01.530
You guys need to get out of here!

33:01.530 --> 33:02.853
This is my house!

33:03.840 --> 33:05.090
- Oh, this is your house?

33:08.070 --> 33:09.143
Welcome home.

33:12.760 --> 33:13.593
- I hate those guys!

33:13.593 --> 33:14.794
They're such jerks!

33:14.794 --> 33:15.627
- I know.

33:15.627 --> 33:16.956
First, they almost killed Gary,

33:16.956 --> 33:19.030
and now they're keeping that kid hostage.

33:19.030 --> 33:20.833
- Okay, we have to help him.

33:24.320 --> 33:25.193
- I got an idea.

33:27.380 --> 33:32.380
The hunters are about
to become the haunted.

33:35.500 --> 33:37.775
- Okay, I see what you did there.

33:37.775 --> 33:38.775
It was good.

33:46.900 --> 33:49.310
- I gave you a chance, kid.

33:49.310 --> 33:52.524
I told you to leave, twice.

33:52.524 --> 33:54.980
Two times.

33:54.980 --> 33:57.692
But you had to be a stubborn
little brat, now didn't you?

33:57.692 --> 34:00.270
A little brat.

34:00.270 --> 34:02.623
Willy, I got this.

34:05.710 --> 34:07.160
Now I need you to

34:07.160 --> 34:09.370
be a good little boy.
(device beeping)

34:09.370 --> 34:11.303
And let the big boys finish their job.

34:13.150 --> 34:15.467
(loud roar)

34:15.467 --> 34:17.063
What in the hell?!

34:21.416 --> 34:23.833
(loud growl)

34:27.996 --> 34:30.329
(loud roar)

34:32.482 --> 34:35.538
(loud growl)

34:35.538 --> 34:37.955
(loud growl)

34:41.143 --> 34:43.443
- Welcome to the jungle.

34:43.443 --> 34:46.572
- Hunting season's open, baby!
(paintball guns firing)

34:46.572 --> 34:49.072
(Max yelping)

34:53.739 --> 34:54.572
- Get out of here!

34:54.572 --> 34:56.449
Let's get out of here!

34:56.449 --> 34:59.116
(Willy yelping)

35:00.099 --> 35:01.123
- [Christy] We were just
starting to have fun!

35:01.123 --> 35:03.390
- [Chris] It's a shame, I had
the perfect place on the wall

35:03.390 --> 35:04.910
to mount their heads.

35:04.910 --> 35:05.847
- Of course.

35:05.847 --> 35:08.764
(Christy chuckles)

35:13.440 --> 35:14.543
Are you okay?

35:18.542 --> 35:19.452
(screams)

35:19.452 --> 35:21.260
(loud whoosh)

35:21.260 --> 35:22.243
Relax.

35:24.060 --> 35:25.010
Just here to help.

35:25.010 --> 35:26.930
Those were the bad guys, not us.

35:26.930 --> 35:28.957
- It's like my grandmother used to say,

35:28.957 --> 35:31.373
"Got to be afraid of the
living than the dead."

35:33.010 --> 35:34.360
- [Christy] Promise not to scream,

35:34.360 --> 35:35.920
and I'll give you your voice back.

35:35.920 --> 35:36.753
Deal?

35:40.114 --> 35:42.614
(loud whoosh)

35:43.560 --> 35:44.680
- [Jorge] Thank you.

35:44.680 --> 35:46.170
- You're welcome.

35:46.170 --> 35:47.380
I'm Christy.

35:47.380 --> 35:48.580
That's my brother Chris.

35:50.560 --> 35:51.950
- I'm Jorge.

35:51.950 --> 35:54.850
- Yeah, we know, we saw you
with your family this morning.

35:56.090 --> 35:57.760
- I knew I saw something!

35:57.760 --> 36:00.250
- Yeah, that was Christy
not doing a very good

36:00.250 --> 36:01.313
of being a ghost.

36:05.690 --> 36:06.840
- I thought she did a pretty good job

36:06.840 --> 36:08.450
of the whole ghost thing.

36:08.450 --> 36:09.283
- Thank you.

36:11.290 --> 36:12.357
- Oh, dear God.

36:15.980 --> 36:19.260
- So, are you guys gonna be
staying here when we move in?

36:19.260 --> 36:23.423
- Well, are you planning on
kicking us out of our house?

36:24.570 --> 36:25.403
- No.

36:25.403 --> 36:26.833
Okay, I didn't mean that.

36:27.900 --> 36:31.793
Of course you guys can stay
here, just can't scare anyone.

36:33.437 --> 36:34.530
(Christy chuckles)

36:34.530 --> 36:36.273
- We kinda already did!

36:37.640 --> 36:40.283
- Yeah, your grandmother
came by this morning.

36:41.690 --> 36:43.433
- You scared my grandma?

36:44.270 --> 36:46.290
She's like, a hundred!

36:46.290 --> 36:48.050
- In our defense, she did
try to get us to leave

36:48.050 --> 36:50.073
with some Santeria kind of things, so.

36:52.377 --> 36:53.350
(chuckles)

36:53.350 --> 36:54.183
What?

36:56.417 --> 36:57.974
- Oh, I wish I could've seen it.

36:57.974 --> 36:59.470
(laughs)

36:59.470 --> 37:00.732
- It was good.
- Good, yeah.

37:00.732 --> 37:02.149
- [Christy] Yeah.

37:04.090 --> 37:06.963
- So, what brings you to the neighborhood?

37:08.420 --> 37:11.330
- Uh, we moved here from California

37:11.330 --> 37:14.023
because my grandfather
passed away not too long ago.

37:14.990 --> 37:16.460
And so, you know, my
dad wanted to be closer

37:16.460 --> 37:17.360
to my grandmother.

37:19.545 --> 37:22.780
- [Christy] Oh, I'm so
sorry about the eggs.

37:22.780 --> 37:24.760
- Oh, no, don't worry, it's fine, really.

37:24.760 --> 37:26.450
I mean, she deserved it.

37:26.450 --> 37:28.910
But how about you guys?

37:28.910 --> 37:32.000
If, you know, you don't mind me asking.

37:32.000 --> 37:33.270
- We actually do mind you asking.

37:33.270 --> 37:34.170
- [Christy] Chris.

37:37.070 --> 37:38.070
- I'm sorry.

37:38.070 --> 37:39.400
- No, it's okay.

37:39.400 --> 37:41.160
It'll be 10 years this Halloween

37:41.160 --> 37:43.420
since the incident happened.

37:43.420 --> 37:46.170
- You really don't have to
tell me anything at all.

37:46.170 --> 37:47.570
- It's fine.

37:47.570 --> 37:49.270
We were driving to a Halloween party--

37:49.270 --> 37:50.950
- I was driving.

37:52.600 --> 37:54.537
- Chris was driving us
to a Halloween party,

37:54.537 --> 37:56.650
and it was raining out.

37:56.650 --> 37:58.120
A cat ran in front of us,

37:58.120 --> 38:01.590
and since the roads were
wet, we went into a canal.

38:01.590 --> 38:03.570
We weren't able to get out.

38:03.570 --> 38:05.523
- Yeah, so basically,
we're here 'cause of me.

38:11.440 --> 38:12.670
- I try and tell him all the time,

38:12.670 --> 38:14.090
it wasn't his fault, but...

38:15.430 --> 38:16.864
- Look, I'm so sorry.

38:16.864 --> 38:18.697
I didn't--
- It's okay.

38:21.680 --> 38:23.180
- I've really got to head out.

38:24.220 --> 38:26.680
- Hey, can you do me a favor?

38:26.680 --> 38:27.810
- Sure.

38:27.810 --> 38:29.790
- Please don't tell your parents about us.

38:29.790 --> 38:31.160
I mean, they seem like good people,

38:31.160 --> 38:33.210
so I don't want them to be scared

38:33.210 --> 38:35.020
moving into a haunted house.

38:35.020 --> 38:36.520
- Yeah.

38:36.520 --> 38:37.353
Okay.

38:39.200 --> 38:40.033
- Um, hey.

38:41.230 --> 38:43.530
When will you be back next?

38:43.530 --> 38:44.530
- Probably tomorrow.

38:45.530 --> 38:48.750
- [Christy] Okay, cool, I
guess I'll see you then.

38:48.750 --> 38:50.310
- Okay.

38:50.310 --> 38:51.703
Cool, I'll see you then.

38:58.087 --> 39:02.412
- [Juana] Nelson, you guys
can't live in that house.

39:02.412 --> 39:03.962
- Mom, we spoke about this yesterday.

39:03.962 --> 39:06.395
- [Juana] Yes, I know we
spoke about it yesterday

39:06.395 --> 39:08.853
but today is today and
yesterday was yesterday.

39:08.853 --> 39:11.872
- And today I change my mind.

39:11.872 --> 39:15.463
- But what happened Juana?
There has to be a reason.

39:15.463 --> 39:19.238
- Yes, I know, but promise me
you won't get mad at me. Okay?

39:20.738 --> 39:23.596
- Well, early this morning

39:23.596 --> 39:28.179
I went to the house with my friend, Santo.

39:28.837 --> 39:29.670
- [Nelson] The santero?

39:29.670 --> 39:30.503
- [Juana] Yes.

39:31.605 --> 39:33.534
- Grandma, you saw Santa Claus?

39:33.534 --> 39:34.840
- Oh stop it, child.

39:34.840 --> 39:36.040
- Nora, please.

39:36.040 --> 39:37.300
It's an adult conversation.

39:37.300 --> 39:38.814
Keep these on.

39:38.814 --> 39:42.230
-Juana, Please don't tell me
it was you that made that mess.

39:42.230 --> 39:43.063
- [Juana] Mm-mm.

39:44.954 --> 39:47.829
The eggs? I spent 2 hours
cleaning those eggs!

39:47.829 --> 39:48.662
- [Juana] It wasn't me!

39:48.662 --> 39:49.495
- [Juana] It wasn't me!

39:49.878 --> 39:53.219
- [Juana] The ghosts threw those eggs!

39:53.219 --> 39:54.435
- Jesus Christ, Mom!

39:54.435 --> 39:57.076
- Yes, jesus Christ, we
need him here right now!

39:57.943 --> 40:00.302
- Grandma, you saw Jesus Christ?

40:00.302 --> 40:02.352
- [Juana] Oh, child.
- Nora, adult conversation.

40:02.360 --> 40:03.193
Come on.

40:03.193 --> 40:04.506
You know this already.

40:04.506 --> 40:07.289
- Juana, I'm sorry, but you're crazy.

40:07.289 --> 40:09.880
- [Juana] I might be
old, and not that old.

40:10.022 --> 40:12.081
- [Juana] But I'm definitely not crazy.

40:13.024 --> 40:15.447
- How's it going? What's up?

40:15.447 --> 40:18.453
- [Nora] Abuela saw Santa
Claus and Jesus Christ.

40:19.320 --> 40:21.273
- Nora, just go to your room, please.

40:21.273 --> 40:22.880
- I am in my room.

40:22.880 --> 40:24.530
I sleep on the sofa.

40:24.530 --> 40:26.830
- Apparently, your
grandmother went to the house

40:26.830 --> 40:30.156
and ghosts threw eggs at her.

40:30.156 --> 40:33.314
- [Juana] It's okay, laugh
at me, it doesn't matter.

40:33.314 --> 40:36.120
- I just went to the house
and I didn't see a thing.

40:36.120 --> 40:37.760
- You went to the house?

40:37.760 --> 40:40.190
- [Jorge] Yeah, I stopped
by on the way here.

40:40.190 --> 40:41.140
- How'd you get in?

40:45.424 --> 40:46.713
- The door was unlocked.

40:54.660 --> 40:56.074
- I locked the door.

40:56.074 --> 41:01.074
- [Juana] I'm glad! I'm glad!
You see? It was the ghosts!

41:01.074 --> 41:01.907
- Grandma, please.

41:01.907 --> 41:02.740
- [Nelson] Mom, please.

41:03.999 --> 41:08.399
- [Juana] Fine! I'll shut
up! I won't say another word!

41:08.399 --> 41:09.883
- I shot my mouse!

41:12.500 --> 41:14.860
- Why did Abuela shoot her mouse?

41:14.860 --> 41:16.940
- I didn't even know she had a mouse.

41:16.940 --> 41:19.090
- Why is she making
this so difficult to us?

41:19.090 --> 41:20.670
- Babe, she's getting old.

41:20.670 --> 41:23.980
- Yeah, Dad, she's like,
hundred years old or something.

41:23.980 --> 41:26.170
- You guys, she's been through a lot.

41:26.170 --> 41:29.433
- Right, like, you know,
communist and stuff.

41:30.283 --> 41:32.679
- What?
- What are you talking about?

41:32.679 --> 41:34.150
- I don't know, look,
what I'm trying to say

41:34.150 --> 41:36.559
is that you can't believe
everything she says.

41:36.559 --> 41:38.058
Okay?

41:38.058 --> 41:41.716
-Babe, you have to be patient
with your mom, especially now.

41:41.716 --> 41:44.282
- She's got a lot on her mind.

41:44.880 --> 41:45.713
- I have an idea.

41:45.713 --> 41:46.990
Why don't you two go to the store

41:46.990 --> 41:49.490
and that way we can
start painting tomorrow?

41:49.490 --> 41:50.450
- Yeah.

41:50.450 --> 41:52.010
Let's do it.

41:52.010 --> 41:53.050
- [Nelson] Yeah, sure.

41:53.050 --> 41:53.883
- [Gaby] I love you.

41:53.883 --> 41:54.863
- I love you too.

41:56.610 --> 41:57.610
- Hello?

41:57.610 --> 41:59.670
Can you guys not do that in my room?

41:59.670 --> 42:01.590
It's no kiss zone.

42:01.590 --> 42:03.260
- [Both] Oh, really?!

42:03.260 --> 42:04.391
- Okay.
- Ah.

42:04.391 --> 42:06.561
(both smacking lips)

42:06.561 --> 42:07.823
Mwah, mwah.

42:07.823 --> 42:09.314
Mwah, mwah, mwah, mwah, mwah,

42:09.314 --> 42:10.147
mwah, mwah, mwah.
- Are you playing cards?

42:10.147 --> 42:11.571
Are you playing cards? You playing cards?

42:11.571 --> 42:13.457
Yeah, oh, oh, did you need that one?

42:13.457 --> 42:15.290
Did you need that one?

42:21.417 --> 42:23.003
- [Nora] I'm gonna go play.

42:24.120 --> 42:26.290
- [Jorge] Or you can try helping us.

42:26.290 --> 42:28.907
- According to Dad, I'm a princess,

42:28.907 --> 42:31.413
and princesses don't help, so no.

42:39.366 --> 42:42.907
- Mom, is that necessary?

42:42.907 --> 42:44.982
- Of course it is!

42:44.990 --> 42:48.873
- You're lucky I haven't
called the pope yet.

42:49.030 --> 42:50.593
- [Gaby] Nelson, let her be.

42:59.115 --> 43:00.263
(fidget spinner whirring)
- Oh!

43:05.280 --> 43:06.470
- So we met Nora.

43:06.470 --> 43:07.780
- Yeah, I see.

43:07.780 --> 43:09.410
What, you guys couldn't
disappear or something?

43:09.410 --> 43:11.510
- We thought we could, but
she could still see us, so.

43:11.510 --> 43:12.933
- I see dead people.

43:14.020 --> 43:15.350
- Hey, me too.
(Christy chuckles)

43:15.350 --> 43:16.358
- [Christy] That was funny.

43:16.358 --> 43:17.607
- All right, all right, all right.

43:17.607 --> 43:19.610
Nora, you need to listen to me.

43:19.610 --> 43:24.207
You can't tell Mom or Dad or
Grandma or anyone about this.

43:24.207 --> 43:26.523
You got to keep this
our little secret, okay?

43:27.470 --> 43:29.130
- [Nora] Give me your room.

43:29.130 --> 43:30.340
- What?

43:30.340 --> 43:32.443
- Give me your room!

43:33.670 --> 43:34.650
- My bedroom?

43:34.650 --> 43:35.483
- Yes.

43:37.030 --> 43:38.470
- That's my bedroom, I can't.

43:38.470 --> 43:40.293
I don't want to give
you that. It's bigger.

43:41.910 --> 43:42.743
- Okay.

43:43.585 --> 43:44.418
Mom!
- No!

43:45.730 --> 43:46.563
- Nope.

43:49.210 --> 43:50.043
- Okay, fine.

43:51.428 --> 43:52.703
You can have it.

43:52.703 --> 43:54.965
- Well, thank you, Brother.

43:54.965 --> 43:58.190
You're so kind and generous!

43:58.190 --> 43:59.430
- Can you get outta here?

43:59.430 --> 44:00.860
I need to talk to them.

44:00.860 --> 44:03.477
- Anything for the brother of the year.

44:03.477 --> 44:06.483
If you need me, I'll be in my new room.

44:07.669 --> 44:09.207
(fidget spinner whirring)

44:09.207 --> 44:12.547
(Chris yelps)
(Jorge sighs)

44:12.547 --> 44:15.558
(Jorge sighs)

44:15.558 --> 44:17.850
- [Chris] Ouch, you just got
hustled by a little girl.

44:17.850 --> 44:20.140
- [Christy] Shut up, Chris.

44:20.140 --> 44:22.003
I used to hustle you all the time.

44:24.310 --> 44:26.570
- No, no--
- Mm-hm, yeah.

44:26.570 --> 44:28.410
Remember when I saw you
break Mom's favorite vase,

44:28.410 --> 44:30.300
and I got your entire candy stash?

44:30.300 --> 44:31.380
- That was some really--
- Okay, I need to ask

44:31.380 --> 44:33.330
you guys a question.

44:33.330 --> 44:35.180
- Yeah, um, but before you do,

44:35.180 --> 44:37.493
um, I just wanted to say something.

44:38.810 --> 44:42.130
I just wanted to
apologize for my behavior.

44:42.130 --> 44:45.690
Lately, I've been frustrated
about some certain things

44:45.690 --> 44:48.220
and just shouldn't have
taken it out on you,

44:48.220 --> 44:50.943
so, uh, I'm sorry.

44:52.100 --> 44:53.270
- It's okay.

44:53.270 --> 44:54.740
No worries.
- Cool, cool.

44:54.740 --> 44:55.710
We cool. Cool.

44:55.710 --> 44:56.890
Are we good? Yeah?

44:56.890 --> 44:57.840
- Yeah.
- Awesome.

44:58.740 --> 45:00.960
- Oh, so, what did you want to ask us?

45:00.960 --> 45:02.520
- Right.

45:02.520 --> 45:05.040
So, um, since I'm new in town,

45:05.040 --> 45:08.960
I don't really have much, any friends,

45:08.960 --> 45:11.040
so I was thinking since
Halloween's coming up,

45:11.040 --> 45:15.480
if it would be a fun idea to
throw a Halloween party here?

45:15.480 --> 45:16.313
- No!
- Yes!

45:17.960 --> 45:18.793
Why?

45:19.681 --> 45:20.870
- Are you kidding me?

45:20.870 --> 45:22.610
He's gonna trash the house!

45:22.610 --> 45:24.124
- More than it already is?

45:24.124 --> 45:25.550
(mumbling)

45:25.550 --> 45:26.383
- Oh, no.
- Okay, okay, listen to me.

45:26.383 --> 45:27.216
Listen to me.
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no--

45:27.216 --> 45:29.070
- This is my house as much as it is yours.

45:29.070 --> 45:31.114
I'm not gonna let anything happen.

45:31.114 --> 45:32.080
- No, no.
- Nothing's gonna happen.

45:32.080 --> 45:33.210
- Plus, it'll make up

45:33.210 --> 45:35.160
for the Halloween party that we missed.

45:36.920 --> 45:37.753
Please?

45:39.440 --> 45:40.930
- Under one condition.

45:40.930 --> 45:42.620
- You name it.

45:42.620 --> 45:44.170
- Just keep it small?

45:44.170 --> 45:45.003
- Done.

45:45.003 --> 45:45.836
- Yes!

45:45.836 --> 45:47.042
I'm so excited!

45:49.800 --> 45:50.873
Sorry. Um.

45:52.720 --> 45:53.700
Did I do that?
- Yeah, that was awkward

45:53.700 --> 45:55.244
for everybody.

45:55.244 --> 45:56.650
- Jorge!
- Coming!

45:56.650 --> 46:00.130
I got to go.

46:01.620 --> 46:02.980
If you're not doing anything tomorrow,

46:02.980 --> 46:06.150
maybe I could take you out
and could look at the town,

46:06.150 --> 46:09.443
you know, since you're new
and kind of friendless.

46:10.940 --> 46:13.303
- Um, yeah.

46:14.160 --> 46:14.993
- Cool.

46:19.300 --> 46:20.830
- Are you guys having a
staring contest or something?

46:20.830 --> 46:23.310
'Cause it kinda looked
like it a little bit.

46:23.310 --> 46:24.430
- No, uh--

46:24.430 --> 46:26.127
- No? No, um.
- Yeah.

46:26.127 --> 46:27.550
- No?
- No, no staring contest.

46:27.550 --> 46:28.640
- Oh, okay.

46:28.640 --> 46:29.840
Just curious.
- No.

46:29.840 --> 46:30.710
- No, no?
- Just talking.

46:30.710 --> 46:32.460
- [Chris] Oh, okay, well--

46:32.460 --> 46:33.293
- Jorge.

46:34.230 --> 46:35.180
What are you doing?

46:36.700 --> 46:38.063
- I was on the phone.

46:39.460 --> 46:41.233
Talking.
- Who were you talking to?

46:42.480 --> 46:43.565
- Friends.

46:43.565 --> 46:44.696
- Let's get to work.

46:44.696 --> 46:46.021
- Let's go.

46:46.146 --> 46:46.979
(Latin Jazz Music Plays)

47:12.450 --> 47:16.225
- Oh lord, please protect us. Protect us.

47:16.225 --> 47:17.975
- This house is full
of demons. Protect us.

47:25.013 --> 47:26.214
- Ooh!
- Ooh!

47:26.214 --> 47:31.214
- Ah!
(Juana screams)

47:31.364 --> 47:34.031
(Juana humming)

47:44.454 --> 47:48.204
(chanting)

47:52.861 --> 47:54.158
- God bless you.

47:54.158 --> 47:55.650
God bless you.

47:55.650 --> 47:56.483
God bless.

47:56.483 --> 47:59.148

47:59.148 --> 48:03.398
(Chanting)

48:17.678 --> 48:20.345
(Juana humming)

48:36.460 --> 48:38.557
- Yo, Jorge, what's Gucci?

48:38.557 --> 48:39.480
- Yo, what's up, guys?

48:39.480 --> 48:40.760
I've been looking all over for you.

48:40.760 --> 48:42.550
All right, so I've got some Gucci news.

48:42.550 --> 48:43.383
- Wait, what?

48:44.700 --> 48:46.177
Gucci, what's that mean?

48:47.300 --> 48:51.230
- Gucci means good, so
I've got Gucci news.

48:51.230 --> 48:52.063
- [Rob] No.

48:53.620 --> 48:54.453
- Okay, well, never mind.

48:54.453 --> 48:57.800
Look, anyway, are you guys
ready to party on Halloween?

48:57.800 --> 48:58.800
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.

48:58.800 --> 48:59.633
Wait, it's going down?

48:59.633 --> 49:00.466
- It's going down, man.

49:00.466 --> 49:02.895
- No, way, dude, yo!
(Mark screeches)

49:02.895 --> 49:04.440
Yo, dude--
- This party is gonna be lit.

49:04.440 --> 49:06.020
- Yeah, I mean, the house has electricity,

49:06.020 --> 49:07.577
so we'll have lights.

49:07.577 --> 49:08.410
- What?

49:08.410 --> 49:09.290
No, lit.

49:09.290 --> 49:10.760
Lit like, good.

49:10.760 --> 49:11.593
Like it's good.

49:13.116 --> 49:13.949
Like it's good?

49:13.949 --> 49:15.340
- Yeah, man, why don't you
guys just say the word good?

49:15.340 --> 49:16.274
- But I, dude.

49:16.274 --> 49:17.930
(school bell rings)

49:17.930 --> 49:19.130
I'll catch up with you later, all right?

49:19.130 --> 49:20.940
I'm a pass it around,
I'm gonna tell everyone.

49:20.940 --> 49:22.280
- [Jorge] Yo, yo, wait, wait, wait.

49:22.280 --> 49:23.510
Please do me a favor.

49:23.510 --> 49:24.360
- [Guillermo] What's up?

49:24.360 --> 49:25.460
- Let's try to keep this small.

49:25.460 --> 49:26.900
I don't want it to get
too crazy, all right?

49:26.900 --> 49:29.540
- [Guillermo] Jorge, Jorge,
calm down, I got you.

49:29.540 --> 49:30.763
It's all Gucci, bro.

49:31.820 --> 49:32.787
- Okay.

49:32.787 --> 49:33.867
All right.

49:33.867 --> 49:35.034
See you later.

49:39.112 --> 49:41.532
(phone chimes)

49:41.532 --> 49:44.282

50:09.924 --> 50:14.924
(phone buzzing)
(phones chiming)

50:15.802 --> 50:17.638
Yo, this is not Gucci.

50:17.638 --> 50:22.638
(phone buzzing)
(phones chiming)

50:41.078 --> 50:42.846
You look beautiful.

50:42.846 --> 50:43.772
You look beautiful.

50:43.772 --> 50:46.327
I think you look beautiful.

50:46.327 --> 50:48.370
Ah, it doesn't matter you're a ghost, eh,

50:48.370 --> 50:50.870
I can see you, that's
all that matters, right?

50:51.760 --> 50:52.593
- Max.

50:53.500 --> 50:54.963
Wake up. The kid's back.

50:55.896 --> 50:57.453
(Max snoring)
Max, wake up.

50:58.461 --> 50:59.294
- Hey, wake up!

50:59.294 --> 51:00.127
- What happened?!

51:01.400 --> 51:02.483
The kid's back.

51:09.920 --> 51:11.333
- That little punk.

51:12.290 --> 51:14.390
- Him and those stupid ghosts
think they can humiliate us

51:14.390 --> 51:15.440
and get away with it?

51:17.784 --> 51:20.392
- They don't know what's
in store for them.

51:24.450 --> 51:26.045
Willy, what are you doing?

51:26.045 --> 51:27.300
- [Willy] Shh.

51:27.300 --> 51:28.623
Scoping out the house.

51:29.470 --> 51:30.700
- Oh, yeah?

51:30.700 --> 51:32.003
Is the house in space?

51:33.460 --> 51:37.000
- Well, technically,
the house is on Earth,

51:37.000 --> 51:40.803
the Earth is in the Solar
System in space, so yeah.

51:43.400 --> 51:45.000
- Get this thing out of my face.

51:46.150 --> 51:47.200
- [Willy] What's the magic word--

51:47.200 --> 51:48.033
- Now!

51:51.460 --> 51:53.870
- Not as magical as please, but okay.

51:59.583 --> 52:02.110
- We need to find a way
to get into that house

52:02.110 --> 52:04.173
and expose those ghosts.

52:06.730 --> 52:09.013
- And how we going to do that?

52:11.570 --> 52:12.403
- Simple.

52:14.270 --> 52:16.333
How do people get famous nowadays?

52:18.839 --> 52:21.833
- Hotdog eating contest.

52:21.833 --> 52:24.941
- Great idea!

52:24.941 --> 52:26.260
- What?

52:26.260 --> 52:29.130
No, Willy, that is not a good idea.

52:29.130 --> 52:30.750
A hotdog eating contest?

52:30.750 --> 52:34.170
That's not even the top
25 ways of getting famous!

52:34.170 --> 52:36.270
I'm talking viral videos, man.

52:36.270 --> 52:38.770
Viral videos.

52:38.770 --> 52:40.410
We go into the house,

52:40.410 --> 52:42.420
prove to the world that ghosts do exist

52:42.420 --> 52:45.493
by getting footage of us
capturing said ghosts,

52:46.490 --> 52:51.485
and then we become the most
famous paranormal hunters ever.

52:53.000 --> 52:54.110
- Yes!

52:54.110 --> 52:57.300
And then we get our own TV
show, and then the movies,

52:57.300 --> 53:02.010
and then comic books,
and, oh, action figures.

53:02.010 --> 53:03.790
I always wanted my own action figure.

53:03.790 --> 53:05.673
I would play with myself all day long.

53:12.679 --> 53:15.012
(Max sighs)

53:28.140 --> 53:28.973
- Hello?

53:35.780 --> 53:36.613
Hello?

53:40.253 --> 53:42.670
(screams)

53:42.670 --> 53:44.980
You guys scared the crap out of me.

53:44.980 --> 53:47.540
- Sorry, we're kind of used to doing that.

53:48.611 --> 53:50.550
- What, giving people heart attacks?

53:50.550 --> 53:52.163
- I mean, I guess.

53:53.670 --> 53:55.793
- Oh, it's actually only happened twice.

53:56.860 --> 53:58.160
- I mean, you would think.

54:00.140 --> 54:01.037
- So where did my parents go?

54:01.037 --> 54:01.917
You didn't scare them, did you?

54:01.917 --> 54:03.040
- No.
- Oh, no, no.

54:03.040 --> 54:04.360
They left like, 30 minutes ago.

54:04.360 --> 54:07.715
They said something about
taking your grandma home, yeah.

54:07.715 --> 54:09.060
(chuckles)

54:09.060 --> 54:10.830
- Okay.
- Yeah, yeah.

54:10.830 --> 54:12.630
- So, you ready?

54:12.630 --> 54:13.480
- Yeah, let's go.

54:14.360 --> 54:15.610
- Oh yeah.
- Yeah.

54:15.610 --> 54:17.750
Oh, no, no, you guys have fun, yeah.

54:17.750 --> 54:18.900
- I mean, the Uber's outside waiting.

54:18.900 --> 54:20.380
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, cool.

54:20.380 --> 54:21.337
- Yeah, we once tried taking an Uber,

54:21.337 --> 54:23.000
it didn't really work out.

54:23.000 --> 54:24.093
Just went past us.

54:25.050 --> 54:25.883
- Stay safe!

54:38.468 --> 54:41.060
- [Max] Who the heck is he talking to?

54:41.060 --> 54:43.410
- Maybe he has one of
those Bluetooth headsets.

54:46.680 --> 54:47.513
- [Max] No.

54:47.513 --> 54:50.059
No, no, that's not a
Bluetooth he's talking into.

58:29.630 --> 58:30.830
- Me too.

58:30.830 --> 58:32.730
We got a lot done in such a little time.

58:33.640 --> 58:35.360
- Yeah, more than I would ever imagined.

58:35.360 --> 58:37.750
- Yeah, seems almost impossible

58:37.750 --> 58:39.431
to do everything that we did.

58:39.431 --> 58:40.380
- Right?

58:40.380 --> 58:42.400
Kinda felt like '80s movies montage.

58:42.400 --> 58:43.233
- Yeah.

58:44.110 --> 58:44.943
Weird.

58:49.150 --> 58:51.270
So we should probably end this

58:51.270 --> 58:53.603
like most '80s movie montages end, right?

58:54.550 --> 58:55.383
- How's that?

58:56.560 --> 58:57.653
- Like this.

59:01.080 --> 59:02.127
- Hi, Jorge.

59:03.743 --> 59:07.460
- What's wrong with your lips?

59:07.460 --> 59:10.090
- Yeah, my lips hurt.

59:10.090 --> 59:11.700
- [Nora] It's probably herpes.

59:11.700 --> 59:12.693
- Shut up, Nora.

59:13.724 --> 59:16.400
- Put some Vicks VapoRub on
it, that cures everything.

59:16.400 --> 59:19.000
- Yeah, no, don't do that.

59:19.000 --> 59:20.000
Where have you been?

59:21.210 --> 59:22.630
- I was hanging out with a friend.

59:22.630 --> 59:25.404
- Ooh, a friend, a new friend.

59:25.404 --> 59:27.860
- How nice! He's already got a friend.

59:27.860 --> 59:29.060
- [Nelson] That's awesome, Jorge.

59:29.060 --> 59:29.893
That's awesome.

59:31.780 --> 59:33.673
- I feel like you guys shouldn't
be that excited about that.

59:33.673 --> 59:36.120
I've had friends before.

59:36.120 --> 59:37.773
- Define friend.

59:42.140 --> 59:44.990
- Hey, you guys look exhausted.

59:44.990 --> 59:47.460
I mean, you did a lot today.

59:47.460 --> 59:49.030
- [Nelson] Yeah, we've
just been hanging out,

59:49.030 --> 59:50.130
standing around here.

59:50.130 --> 59:50.963
- Right.

59:50.963 --> 59:51.800
(both chuckle)

59:51.800 --> 59:54.020
Should probably take the day off tomorrow.

59:54.020 --> 59:56.400
- [Nelson] Nah, we got to
finish up, you know that.

59:56.400 --> 59:58.390
- I mean, come on, you've
been painting all day.

59:58.390 --> 59:59.680
It looks great.

59:59.680 --> 01:00:01.900
You deserve to take a break.

01:00:01.900 --> 01:00:05.395
I don't know, maybe a little
spa day action, right, Ma?

01:00:05.395 --> 01:00:06.420
- Ah.

01:00:06.420 --> 01:00:07.420
He said the magic word.

01:00:07.420 --> 01:00:08.253
Spa!

01:00:09.706 --> 01:00:10.650
- See what you did?

01:00:10.650 --> 01:00:13.280
- [Jorge] Ooh, you guys
could do couples massage.

01:00:13.280 --> 01:00:15.280
- More magical words.

01:00:15.280 --> 01:00:16.370
Couples massage.

01:00:16.370 --> 01:00:18.131
Come on, we deserve it.

01:00:18.131 --> 01:00:21.214
- [Juana] Yes, my love, don't be silly

01:00:21.222 --> 01:00:23.897
Go spend the day with your little wife.

01:00:23.897 --> 01:00:27.413
- Mom, you always have
the perfect words to say.

01:00:30.650 --> 01:00:31.710
- Fine, fine.

01:00:31.710 --> 01:00:32.847
We'll do a spa day.
- Yes!

01:00:32.847 --> 01:00:35.200
- But you promise we'll
finish up tomorrow.

01:00:35.200 --> 01:00:36.200
- Yes, sir.

01:00:36.200 --> 01:00:37.652
- All right, now come on, come in.

01:00:37.652 --> 01:00:38.921
Come in, everybody.

01:00:38.921 --> 01:00:39.932
Come on.

01:00:39.932 --> 01:00:41.080
Come on.

01:00:41.080 --> 01:00:41.913
Come on.

01:00:44.520 --> 01:00:45.353
You feel that?

01:00:45.353 --> 01:00:48.500
- [Nora] Um, Grandma's
heavy breathing on my face?

01:00:48.500 --> 01:00:50.220
- No, no, no.

01:00:50.220 --> 01:00:51.853
This house is peaceful.

01:00:54.781 --> 01:00:57.448
(ominous music)

01:01:02.450 --> 01:01:04.657
- Looks like it's almost time.

01:01:10.690 --> 01:01:12.240
- So these friends of yours

01:01:12.240 --> 01:01:14.800
replaced good with Gucci and lit?

01:01:14.800 --> 01:01:15.840
- [Jorge] Yeah.

01:01:15.840 --> 01:01:17.750
- Why don't they just say good?

01:01:17.750 --> 01:01:19.000
- That's what I'm saying.

01:01:22.060 --> 01:01:24.640
- [Chris] I just got
finished with the backyard.

01:01:24.640 --> 01:01:25.850
- Oh, cool, thanks.

01:01:25.850 --> 01:01:27.320
- Yeah, no problem.

01:01:27.320 --> 01:01:29.748
Uh, did you two have fun last night?

01:01:29.748 --> 01:01:32.817
(fidget spinner whirring)

01:01:32.817 --> 01:01:34.740
- [Jorge] Nora, what are you doing here?

01:01:34.740 --> 01:01:36.090
- Mom and Dad are at the spa,

01:01:36.090 --> 01:01:38.847
and Grandma fell asleep
watching soap operas.

01:01:38.847 --> 01:01:42.170
(sounds of TV)

01:01:42.170 --> 01:01:45.830
And I was bored, so I decided
to go trick or treating,

01:01:45.830 --> 01:01:46.780
and came back here.

01:01:51.238 --> 01:01:53.583
- Hey, Nora, you're 10 years old.

01:01:54.720 --> 01:01:57.520
You can't just go trick
or treating by yourself.

01:01:57.520 --> 01:02:01.150
- Okay, cool, so at what time's the party?

01:02:01.150 --> 01:02:02.480
- It doesn't matter
what time the party is,

01:02:02.480 --> 01:02:03.753
you're not coming to the party.

01:02:03.753 --> 01:02:05.390
- Yes, I am.
- No, you're not.

01:02:05.390 --> 01:02:07.476
- Yes, I am!

01:02:07.477 --> 01:02:09.160
- No, you're not!

01:02:09.160 --> 01:02:11.690
- Jorge, do you see this?

01:02:11.690 --> 01:02:14.193
I'm a princess, which
means I do what I want.

01:02:15.940 --> 01:02:18.010
- I don't care if you're the queen,

01:02:18.010 --> 01:02:19.610
you're not coming to this party.

01:02:24.438 --> 01:02:26.510
(phone beeps)
What are you doing?

01:02:26.510 --> 01:02:27.920
- I'm calling Dad to let him know

01:02:27.920 --> 01:02:30.160
you're not letting his
princess come to your party.

01:02:30.160 --> 01:02:30.993
- Oh, no. No, no.

01:02:30.993 --> 01:02:32.870
Okay, okay, fine!

01:02:32.870 --> 01:02:34.170
You can come to the party,

01:02:35.109 --> 01:02:37.610
but you do not tell Mom
or Dad a word about this.

01:02:37.610 --> 01:02:38.443
Not a word.

01:02:39.600 --> 01:02:43.080
- Wow, Jorge, you just got
hustled by a little girl again.

01:02:43.080 --> 01:02:44.586
Nice job, princess.

01:02:44.586 --> 01:02:46.755
- Nice job, princess.

01:02:46.755 --> 01:02:48.323
- [Nora and Christy] What was that?

01:02:49.450 --> 01:02:50.510
- Nothing.

01:02:50.510 --> 01:02:52.060
I'm gonna go finish decorating.

01:02:53.800 --> 01:02:54.711
- Can I come with you?

01:02:54.711 --> 01:02:55.544
Please?

01:03:11.730 --> 01:03:13.363
- [Max] Well, well, well,

01:03:14.210 --> 01:03:17.403
looks like someone's having
a little Halloween party.

01:03:19.116 --> 01:03:21.850
- [Willy] That's awesome!

01:03:21.850 --> 01:03:23.730
- What are you gonna dress up as?

01:03:23.730 --> 01:03:26.690
I think I'm gonna dress
up as the poop emoji.

01:03:26.690 --> 01:03:30.043
Those things are hilarious
because they're literally poop.

01:03:30.970 --> 01:03:33.347
- We're not dressing up
like anything, Willy.

01:03:33.347 --> 01:03:35.104
You don't see what this is?

01:03:35.104 --> 01:03:37.862
- The perfect opportunity.

01:03:37.862 --> 01:03:39.812
- Yes, I know...

01:03:40.093 --> 01:03:42.490
- To dress up like the poop emoji.

01:03:42.490 --> 01:03:43.980
- No, you moron.

01:03:43.980 --> 01:03:47.033
The perfect opportunity
to expose these ghosts.

01:03:48.201 --> 01:03:50.309
- Tonight we enter that house.

01:03:50.801 --> 01:03:54.292
And we capture those ghosts
in front of the entire world.

01:03:56.411 --> 01:03:59.494
It's gonna be a very happy Halloween.

01:04:02.150 --> 01:04:04.567
(both laugh)

01:04:18.240 --> 01:04:19.073
What is this?

01:04:20.110 --> 01:04:21.540
- It's a gift.

01:04:21.540 --> 01:04:23.810
- No, I see it's a gift, Willy,

01:04:23.810 --> 01:04:25.690
but why would you give me a gift

01:04:25.690 --> 01:04:27.563
halfway through my villainous laugh?

01:04:28.600 --> 01:04:29.860
- I thought you were done.

01:04:29.860 --> 01:04:31.113
- Oh, clearly, I wasn't!

01:04:32.490 --> 01:04:33.773
- Open it.

01:04:44.840 --> 01:04:46.053
I made them last night.

01:04:48.260 --> 01:04:49.160
What do you think?

01:04:51.530 --> 01:04:52.660
You're speechless.

01:04:52.660 --> 01:04:54.705
I knew you would love them.

01:04:54.705 --> 01:04:57.455
(Willy chuckles)

01:05:02.415 --> 01:05:05.248
(softly cracking)

01:05:18.810 --> 01:05:20.430
It's okay.

01:05:20.430 --> 01:05:22.490
Those two were yours.

01:05:22.490 --> 01:05:23.633
I made copies.

01:05:25.056 --> 01:05:28.806
(mumbling)

01:05:31.979 --> 01:05:33.687
Ooh, pow, pow, pow.

01:05:33.687 --> 01:05:34.520
Ping.

01:05:36.012 --> 01:05:38.595
(gentle music)

01:06:06.325 --> 01:06:07.950
(knocking)

01:06:07.950 --> 01:06:10.690
- Jeez, Jorge, you've been taking forever.

01:06:10.690 --> 01:06:11.820
Are you almost done?

01:06:11.820 --> 01:06:12.820
- Yeah, I'm almost done, all right?

01:06:12.820 --> 01:06:14.447
It takes a long time to put makeup on.

01:06:14.447 --> 01:06:15.840
- By the time that you're finished,

01:06:15.840 --> 01:06:18.040
the party's gonna be over.
- Shh!

01:06:18.040 --> 01:06:19.791
Hey, would you keep your mouth shut?

01:06:19.791 --> 01:06:21.120
Okay?

01:06:21.120 --> 01:06:22.930
- Hola.
- Hey, guys.

01:06:22.930 --> 01:06:24.293
- Mom, Dad.

01:06:27.342 --> 01:06:28.980
- Jorge, what is wrong with you?

01:06:28.980 --> 01:06:31.540
You've been acting so weird lately.

01:06:31.540 --> 01:06:32.490
- Lately?

01:06:32.490 --> 01:06:34.100
He's always been weird.

01:06:34.100 --> 01:06:35.270
- I'm just a little stressed

01:06:35.270 --> 01:06:37.170
about school and stuff, no big deal.

01:06:37.170 --> 01:06:38.210
But how about you guys?

01:06:38.210 --> 01:06:39.080
How as the spa?

01:06:39.080 --> 01:06:40.236
- [Gaby] Oh, it was great.

01:06:40.236 --> 01:06:43.374
- We're going to sleep
like little angels tonight.

01:06:43.374 --> 01:06:44.969
- Look good, Jorge.
- Thanks, thanks.

01:06:44.969 --> 01:06:46.323
- My princess, like a little princess.

01:06:47.830 --> 01:06:49.330
- See, Jorge?

01:06:49.330 --> 01:06:50.390
Princess!

01:06:50.390 --> 01:06:52.680
- Let's go.
What are you guys doing tonight?

01:06:52.680 --> 01:06:55.280
We are going trick or treating.

01:06:55.280 --> 01:06:56.326
- [Nelson] Great, you can take Grandma.

01:06:56.326 --> 01:06:57.350
- No!

01:06:57.350 --> 01:06:59.800
I mean, no, because it's super late

01:06:59.800 --> 01:07:01.850
and she's probably really tired.

01:07:01.850 --> 01:07:03.433
You know, old people.

01:07:04.370 --> 01:07:05.270
Come on, let's go.

01:07:06.634 --> 01:07:07.594
Come on.

01:07:07.594 --> 01:07:09.462
Come on, come on.

01:07:09.462 --> 01:07:10.295
- Hello!

01:07:11.280 --> 01:07:13.588
- Oh, I'm wonder Grandma

01:07:13.946 --> 01:07:14.779
- Kids!

01:07:14.779 --> 01:07:16.704
- Kids! Where are you?

01:07:16.712 --> 01:07:19.345
- Don't leave me!

01:07:19.345 --> 01:07:20.525
Where are you?

01:07:20.525 --> 01:07:21.624
Jorge!

01:07:21.624 --> 01:07:22.707
Jorge!

01:07:22.707 --> 01:07:25.060
- Kids, where are you
going? What's the rush?

01:07:25.060 --> 01:07:26.315
- Grandma, we're not
going trick or treating.

01:07:26.323 --> 01:07:28.373
- No, no, wait, what
do you mean we're not?

01:07:28.373 --> 01:07:32.089
- Where are we going then?
Just tell me. Tell me.

01:07:33.790 --> 01:07:34.848
- What's wrong?

01:07:34.995 --> 01:07:36.912
We're going to a party.

01:07:38.074 --> 01:07:38.907
- Where are you going?

01:07:40.582 --> 01:07:42.515
- You want to go to a party?

01:07:45.960 --> 01:07:46.793
At the house.

01:07:48.376 --> 01:07:52.362
- What house? Where's the party?

01:07:52.362 --> 01:07:53.378
Our new house.

01:07:53.378 --> 01:07:55.395
- Your house? You're crazy!

01:07:55.395 --> 01:07:58.278
I'm gonna tell your father right now!

01:07:58.290 --> 01:07:59.780
Please, listen to me, okay?!

01:07:59.780 --> 01:08:00.613
- No, no, no, no, no.

01:08:00.613 --> 01:08:02.940
- I can't get in trouble
with your parents.

01:08:02.940 --> 01:08:03.773
- [Jorge] Would you just listen to me?!

01:08:03.773 --> 01:08:05.806
- You be very careful! Very careful!

01:08:05.806 --> 01:08:08.165
- Don't you scream at your Grandmother!

01:08:08.170 --> 01:08:09.140
- [Juana] Okay.

01:08:09.140 --> 01:08:10.780
Okay.

01:08:10.780 --> 01:08:11.930
- I'm sorry, Grandma, I'm sorry.

01:08:11.930 --> 01:08:12.763
- [Juana] Sorry, sorry, sorry.

01:08:12.763 --> 01:08:14.653
- I just want you to
listen to me for a second.

01:08:15.860 --> 01:08:18.303
I have no friends, none,

01:08:19.189 --> 01:08:21.220
so I wanted to throw a
little Halloween party,

01:08:21.220 --> 01:08:22.883
so I can meet a couple people.

01:08:24.410 --> 01:08:27.093
Please, just don't tell Mom or Dad.

01:08:34.680 --> 01:08:39.555
- Well, eh, you want
to go to the party too?

01:08:39.560 --> 01:08:41.260
- You want to go to the party too?

01:08:43.979 --> 01:08:45.233
You going to go?

01:08:46.290 --> 01:08:47.770
Okay.

01:08:47.770 --> 01:08:52.747
Your dad is going to
kill me, but who cares?!

01:08:54.045 --> 01:08:55.064
Let's go!
- Yes!

01:08:55.064 --> 01:08:56.331

01:18:37.630 --> 01:18:38.840
Welcome to the party.

01:18:38.840 --> 01:18:40.993
- We did what you want, now let him go.

01:18:41.947 --> 01:18:43.947
(Max clicking tongue)

01:18:43.947 --> 01:18:46.170
- You see, it's not the
way it's gonna work.

01:18:46.170 --> 01:18:48.393
You don't call the
shots around here, I do.

01:18:50.100 --> 01:18:52.300
So this is what's gonna happen:

01:18:52.300 --> 01:18:55.710
You two are gonna prove
to everybody at this party

01:18:57.100 --> 01:18:58.173
that you're ghosts.

01:18:59.840 --> 01:19:04.070
So I want everybody to
take your cellphones out,

01:19:04.070 --> 01:19:07.650
start recording, take
pictures, stream it online,

01:19:07.650 --> 01:19:11.100
do whatever you got to do, but just do it!

01:19:11.100 --> 01:19:12.930
- [Willy] Everybody!

01:19:12.930 --> 01:19:17.520
- And soon, the world will finally believe

01:19:18.470 --> 01:19:19.520
that ghosts do exist,

01:19:20.790 --> 01:19:25.790
and we will be the most famous
paranormal hunters ever!

01:19:28.570 --> 01:19:30.150
- Gonna have our own action figures.

01:19:30.150 --> 01:19:33.060
- No way!
- Oh, that is so cool.

01:19:34.532 --> 01:19:36.615
- No, no, no, no, no, no.

01:19:39.160 --> 01:19:41.510
- We have breaking news
coming to you live now

01:19:41.510 --> 01:19:43.090
from the southwest Miami area

01:19:43.090 --> 01:19:46.950
where two men appear to
be holding people hostage

01:19:46.950 --> 01:19:48.782
at a Halloween party.

01:19:48.782 --> 01:19:51.171
- Oh no, look. Carlos look. Look!

01:19:51.171 --> 01:19:52.110
- Oh, my god.
- Look.

01:19:52.110 --> 01:19:53.115
- What happened, Jenny?

01:19:53.115 --> 01:19:53.948
(Carlos gasps)

01:19:53.948 --> 01:19:54.781
- No.

01:19:54.781 --> 01:19:57.750
Call the police. Call the police, babe!

01:19:57.750 --> 01:19:58.583
- Look!

01:19:58.583 --> 01:19:59.470
It's Jorge!

01:19:59.470 --> 01:20:01.530
- This whole ordeal
has been streaming live

01:20:01.530 --> 01:20:04.060
across multiple social media platforms.

01:20:04.060 --> 01:20:05.010
- Is that our house?!

01:20:05.010 --> 01:20:08.560
- Catalina Sanchez is at the
scene now with a live report.

01:20:08.560 --> 01:20:11.226
Catalina? We are live from
the famous Bradford House.

01:20:11.226 --> 01:20:15.092
- Where a Halloween party
has turned into a nightmare.

01:20:15.092 --> 01:20:19.133
- As you can see behind me,
the situation is quite serious.

01:20:19.133 --> 01:20:24.129
(phones chiming)
(speaks in foreign language)

01:20:31.543 --> 01:20:36.060
- I am really losing my
patience with you two!

01:20:36.060 --> 01:20:40.250
Prove to everyone that ghosts exist now!

01:20:40.250 --> 01:20:41.759
- [Jorge] Don't do it.

01:20:41.759 --> 01:20:43.955
- Shut up!

01:20:44.930 --> 01:20:46.470
- Okay.

01:20:46.470 --> 01:20:47.303
Okay.

01:20:49.330 --> 01:20:50.270
We can do that.

01:20:51.958 --> 01:20:55.137
(loud whoosh)

01:20:55.137 --> 01:20:57.804
(ominous music)

01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:05.546
- Hit it, DJ!

01:21:05.546 --> 01:21:08.629
("Excess All Areas")

01:21:54.030 --> 01:21:56.613
(crowd cheers)

01:22:20.153 --> 01:22:22.740
- Do you two think you
can humiliate us again

01:22:22.740 --> 01:22:24.137
and get away with it?

01:22:24.137 --> 01:22:25.640
- This ends here!

01:22:25.640 --> 01:22:26.736
It's haunting time!

01:22:26.736 --> 01:22:27.569
- No!
(gun hums)

01:22:27.569 --> 01:22:28.402
(gun zaps)

01:22:28.402 --> 01:22:31.197
- Jorge!
(Jorge groans)

01:22:31.197 --> 01:22:34.297
- Those are the guys
threatening all of these kids!

01:22:34.297 --> 01:22:35.800
- Put the weapon down!

01:22:35.800 --> 01:22:38.320
- I'm not going anywhere
until I get what I came for!

01:22:38.320 --> 01:22:40.415
- I said put the weapon down!

01:22:40.415 --> 01:22:42.449
- We don't bust 'em, we hunt--

01:22:42.449 --> 01:22:43.983
(TASER crackling)

01:22:43.983 --> 01:22:46.566
(crowd cheers)

01:22:48.860 --> 01:22:49.693
- Ooh!

01:22:50.694 --> 01:22:53.877
- Now you got busted and hunted!

01:22:53.877 --> 01:22:54.710
Hey-oh!

01:22:56.428 --> 01:22:58.867
- [Officer] 10-4, at about how long

01:22:58.867 --> 01:23:02.867
prior to making this call
did it actually occur?

01:23:04.245 --> 01:23:06.382
(police radio chattering)

01:23:06.382 --> 01:23:09.736
- Oh, Max, are we famous yet?

01:23:09.736 --> 01:23:10.886
- [Max] Shut up, Willy!

01:23:11.977 --> 01:23:14.660
- Mom, Dad!
- Nora, what happened?!

01:23:14.660 --> 01:23:16.610
- [Nora] Those were the
bad guys, those are ghosts,

01:23:16.610 --> 01:23:18.610
and Jorge is dead.

01:23:19.476 --> 01:23:20.309
- What?

01:23:20.309 --> 01:23:21.150
- Oh, my god.

01:23:21.150 --> 01:23:22.267
I'm so sorry--

01:23:22.267 --> 01:23:23.100
- [Nelson] Look.

01:23:23.100 --> 01:23:23.933
- Are you okay?
- Jorge!

01:23:23.933 --> 01:23:26.906
- Come on, wake up.
- Jorge!

01:23:26.906 --> 01:23:28.770
- [Chris] Wake up, man.

01:23:28.770 --> 01:23:30.898
- Jorge!
- Jorge!

01:23:30.898 --> 01:23:33.481
(gentle music)

01:23:38.919 --> 01:23:39.919
- Am I dead?

01:23:43.170 --> 01:23:44.003
- No.

01:24:28.565 --> 01:24:30.773
- Finally! Thank God!

01:24:30.773 --> 01:24:32.701
- [Gaby] Finally.

01:24:32.701 --> 01:24:34.659
- [Nelson] Now come on, let's get a hug.

01:24:34.659 --> 01:24:35.870
- Grandma.
- I need help.

01:24:35.870 --> 01:24:38.002
(Juana laughs)

01:24:38.002 --> 01:24:41.002
(family chattering)

01:24:42.073 --> 01:24:46.453
- So, I think it's time
for Christy and I to go.

01:24:47.680 --> 01:24:48.513
- Go?

01:24:48.513 --> 01:24:49.513
What do you mean go?

01:24:50.920 --> 01:24:52.770
- Jorge, this isn't our home anymore.

01:24:53.860 --> 01:24:55.490
- Of course this is your home.

01:24:55.490 --> 01:24:58.130
This is your home, and this is our home.

01:24:58.130 --> 01:25:00.823
- She's not talking about
the actual house, Nora.

01:25:01.760 --> 01:25:04.833
She means here, on Earth.

01:25:06.120 --> 01:25:07.620
- Are you guys going to space?

01:25:11.190 --> 01:25:12.397
- Something like that.

01:25:17.640 --> 01:25:18.870
- We've only been here this long

01:25:18.870 --> 01:25:20.090
'cause we couldn't find the right people

01:25:20.090 --> 01:25:21.090
to live in our home.

01:25:23.200 --> 01:25:24.063
Now we have.

01:25:25.185 --> 01:25:27.768
(somber music)

01:25:41.340 --> 01:25:42.173
- Wait!

01:25:43.141 --> 01:25:45.510
Am I ever gonna see you guys again?

01:25:45.510 --> 01:25:46.930
- I don't know how this works.

01:25:46.930 --> 01:25:49.070
I don't know if I'll get a
free pass to visit Earth,

01:25:49.070 --> 01:25:54.070
but I'll see you up there, or
down there, or wherever I go.

01:25:54.100 --> 01:25:56.690
- Oh, you're definitely
going down there for sure.

01:25:56.690 --> 01:25:58.940
I'll let you know how
it is up there, though.

01:26:02.557 --> 01:26:03.947
- [Nora] I'm gonna miss you.

01:26:03.947 --> 01:26:06.254
- [Christy] I'll miss you too.

01:26:06.254 --> 01:26:08.470
- You're like the big sister I never had,

01:26:08.470 --> 01:26:10.660
except for Jorge, of course.

01:26:10.660 --> 01:26:12.940
- Ouch, burned again.

01:26:12.940 --> 01:26:15.383
Gonna need some ointment for that one.

01:26:15.383 --> 01:26:16.760
(chuckles)

01:26:16.760 --> 01:26:18.010
- I'm gonna miss you too.

01:26:19.465 --> 01:26:20.400
- You know, it's just so nice

01:26:20.400 --> 01:26:23.350
that I'm gonna be missed so
much, you know, I'm so glad.

01:26:25.691 --> 01:26:27.382
(Christy chuckles)

01:26:27.382 --> 01:26:28.420
- I'm gonna miss you too, bud.

01:26:28.420 --> 01:26:29.253
- [Chris] Aw, really?

01:26:29.253 --> 01:26:30.718
- Let's hug it out, come on.
- All right.

01:26:30.718 --> 01:26:31.551
Oh.

01:26:32.400 --> 01:26:33.680
Up, down kinda thing?

01:26:33.680 --> 01:26:35.130
- I don't know.
- All right.

01:26:36.220 --> 01:26:37.270
All right, peace out.

01:26:40.300 --> 01:26:42.320
- So can you do me a favor?

01:26:42.320 --> 01:26:43.890
- Anything.

01:26:43.890 --> 01:26:46.640
- Take care of this house
and make some great memories.

01:26:48.078 --> 01:26:49.378
- Think I already started.

01:26:51.160 --> 01:26:51.993
- Here.

01:26:53.546 --> 01:26:54.460
- What's this?

01:26:54.460 --> 01:26:55.293
- Open it.

01:27:01.810 --> 01:27:05.952
So, should we end this like
most '80s movie montages end?

01:27:05.952 --> 01:27:08.535
(gentle music)

01:27:09.420 --> 01:27:11.070
- I Wouldn't have it any other way.

01:27:33.958 --> 01:27:35.267
- [Both] Ahem.

01:27:35.267 --> 01:27:36.508
- [Gaby] Ahem.

01:27:36.508 --> 01:27:39.175
(Nelson coughs)

01:27:49.734 --> 01:27:52.567
- Let's go make some new memories.
