WESLEY: Honestly, have you ever
seen anything lovelier?

00:06.680 --> 00:11.800
So graceful. So full of life.

00:12.040 --> 00:14.031
And those eyes....

00:14.200 --> 00:17.237
Make you feel like
the only man in the room.

00:17.400 --> 00:20.790
Plus, six breasts.
Any man's gotta love that.

00:20.960 --> 00:24.873
Fred doesn't have six breasts. Right?

00:25.040 --> 00:30.068
Sorialus the Ravager. And, yeah,
she's the one from my vision.

00:30.280 --> 00:33.352
Coming to destroy the humans
that killed her mate.

00:33.520 --> 00:38.150
But not for another month or so.
I'll file her under " pending. "

00:38.320 --> 00:40.914
-You gonna ask her out?
-The Ravager?

00:41.480 --> 00:44.597
-Fred.
-Oh.

00:45.640 --> 00:50.839
Yes. But, you know, timing.
I'll make my move when the iron's hot.

00:51.040 --> 00:56.672
Get it done, Johnny Reb, so I can hear
about something besides your hot iron.

00:56.880 --> 00:59.633
Am I very boring on the subject?

00:59.840 --> 01:05.437
There was a time when you thought
I was the loveliest thing in the world.

01:05.640 --> 01:10.156
Well, l....
You' re an extraordinary woman.

01:11.240 --> 01:13.390
-l....
-At ease, soldier.

01:13.560 --> 01:14.879
Just like to hear it every
now and then.

01:15.040 --> 01:19.750
I was the ditsiest bitch in Sunnydale.
Could've had any man I wanted.

01:19.920 --> 01:23.549
Now l' m all superhero-y,
and the best action I can get...

01:23.720 --> 01:27.030
...is an invisible ghost
who's good with a loofa.

01:30.400 --> 01:32.675
I'm sorry, I missed that last part.

01:33.680 --> 01:36.399
-You are a gentleman.
-Who's doing what with a loofa?

01:36.560 --> 01:41.998
Not loofa. Loo-fah-nooc....

01:42.160 --> 01:45.994
-It's a demon.
-So you went with dark colors today.

01:46.160 --> 01:49.948
-Ask me why I'm smiling.
-I will, because it's scaring me.

01:52.960 --> 01:54.757
GUNN:
You are a remarkable woman.

01:55.240 --> 02:00.075
The way you shovel food into your
mouth.... That is some Olympian feat.

02:00.280 --> 02:04.239
Was I a pig? It's just that breakfast
goes so quick and I'm always so--

02:04.400 --> 02:07.597
I just wonder where it goes
in that stick-figure body you got.

02:07.760 --> 02:13.153
-Stick? You're a beast.
-Come on. You know you're gorgeous.

02:13.560 --> 02:17.075
Morning, friends and neighbors.
Are those the tickets?

02:17.280 --> 02:19.748
-See, I got to the ticket place--
-Morning, Fred.

02:19.920 --> 02:20.909
I'm paying you back. This is on me.

02:21.080 --> 02:24.277
Mahta Hari is the tightest band in L.A.
You guys'll be tripping out.

02:24.480 --> 02:26.675
-The thing is--
-I'm good for it.

02:26.840 --> 02:29.274
Don't worry about
Connor's college fund.

02:29.440 --> 02:34.355
The time I saw Mahta Hari, they were--
The Blinnikov World Ballet Corps.

02:34.520 --> 02:38.911
I got to the ticket place, and boom!
T onight only.

02:39.080 --> 02:41.275
You got ballet on my
Mahta Hari tickets?

02:41.440 --> 02:45.797
-The Blinnikov World Ballet Corps.
-He says that like it has meaning.

02:45.960 --> 02:49.316
This is a premier company.
And they' re doing Giselle.

02:49.480 --> 02:51.152
This is all like some horrible dream.

02:51.320 --> 02:53.914
I've heard of them.
Very ahead of their time.

02:54.080 --> 02:59.632
I saw their production of Giselle in 1 890.
I cried like a baby. And I was evil.

02:59.800 --> 03:01.950
-I think it sounds exciting.
-Yes.

03:02.120 --> 03:03.997
No! This is not Mahta Hari.

03:04.160 --> 03:09.598
This is tutus and guys with their
big-ass packages jumping up and down.

03:10.280 --> 03:14.319
-I will never trust you again.
-Get over it. Do we get dressed up?

03:14.480 --> 03:16.038
-Of course.
-I'm in.

03:16.200 --> 03:22.548
Guys, seeing real ballet live,
it's like another world.

03:22.720 --> 03:25.188
These guys are tight.
You'll be tripping out.

Don't be using my own phrases
when we've lost the trust.

03:29.200 --> 03:32.988
Come on. Working day, cases to solve.

03:33.720 --> 03:39.078
I'm not still paying, right?
'Cause this is like a nightmare.

03:40.960 --> 03:44.794
It's such an honor
to have the company here.

03:44.960 --> 03:51.399
All of L.A. is buzzing. T o have
the Blinnikov performing Giselle....

03:51.560 --> 03:54.711
I can't imagine
what tonight's going to be like.

03:54.880 --> 03:58.998

We could go to Cavegirl's House
of Burlap, but that's so last season.

We've gotta step up.

05:09.480 --> 05:13.598
But aren't we, you know, poor?

05:13.760 --> 05:16.069
There's a custom amongst my people:

05:16.240 --> 05:19.471
Buy a dress, wear it once
and return it the next day.

05:19.680 --> 05:22.069
It's all about hiding
the tags while it's on.

05:22.240 --> 05:25.391
Oh. Okay.

I'm very excited. I love the ballet.

I haven't seen much, but my family
used to go to The Nutcracker...

05:33.280 --> 05:37.398
...and I had my first sexual dream
about the Mouse King.

-He feels.

06:07.960 --> 06:11.714
-Feelings?
-There's definite feelings.

06:11.960 --> 06:16.397

there may be actual feeling.

06:16.560 --> 06:20.314
And we have to find a dress for you,
something that will make Angel crazy.

06:20.480 --> 06:22.471
Fred, sweetie, Angel is crazy.

06:22.680 --> 06:25.558
I know he's gonna want
to look his best for you.

06:25.720 --> 06:30.157
That's right. The world's champion is
gonna worry about his outfit.

06:30.480 --> 06:33.153

Is there a stain?

-At least he's sleeping.

lrish lullaby you crooned?

06:44.680 --> 06:48.878

but, more to the point, Cordelia?

06:49.040 --> 06:50.268

06:50.480 --> 06:53.313
I read you while you
were singing, you big corn-muffin.

06:53.560 --> 06:58.270
And can't say as I blame.
I mean, what a woman she's become.

06:58.480 --> 07:02.678
You're not supposed to be reading me.
Anyway, you read me wrong.

It's not just when you're singing.

And stop calling me pastries.

You' re a man of many limitations,
Angel, but you' re a man.

07:34.480 --> 07:37.756
You got a heart.
And Cordelia's a hell of a lady.

07:37.920 --> 07:41.993
If I thought she liked to wear green,
I'd be elbowing you out of the way.

07:42.160 --> 07:46.392
But she's out of my league.
She's a champion, Angel.

-Do I even have to answer that?

08:19.760 --> 08:24.675

you're not much of a ballet fan.

I forgot how homely she was.

to be our incredibly dreary selves.

39:32.040 --> 39:34.759
Wipe it from my memory.

39:34.920 --> 39:38.196
What? Was it, like, disgusting?

39:38.360 --> 39:43.115
No! I....
I would just want....

39:43.280 --> 39:45.475
If we were to....

39:45.920 --> 39:49.037
I would just want it to be...

39:49.200 --> 39:50.792
... new.

39:51.080 --> 39:53.753
Start at the beginning.

39:54.120 --> 39:56.588
Lost me in the middle.

39:56.760 --> 40:01.880
Cordy, you and l, we've been
working together for a long time.

40:03.640 --> 40:08.156
What I mean is, you've become...

40:08.320 --> 40:11.869
...a truly extraordinary woman.

40:12.040 --> 40:14.952
I know we haven't
always gotten along...

40:15.960 --> 40:18.793
...but I think that, you know, we....

40:18.960 --> 40:20.598
-Groo?
-Yes!

40:20.760 --> 40:23.877
We grew closer together, and I think--

40:24.040 --> 40:25.792
CORDELlA: Groo!
GROO: Princess!

40:25.960 --> 40:29.794
CORDELlA:
Oh, my God, I can't believe it!

40:32.640 --> 40:37.270
-I feared you'd forget who I was.
-Remind me.

40:41.040 --> 40:43.270
He just showed up.

40:43.520 --> 40:46.273
Once everyone in Pylea
got their freedom...

40:46.440 --> 40:49.000
...the political situation
got sketchy.

40:49.160 --> 40:54.359
The Groosalugg here got deposed
and they set up a people's republic.

40:54.520 --> 40:59.469
So he came looking for his true love.

41:01.760 --> 41:04.320
-That's good for her.
-Yeah.

41:04.480 --> 41:08.234
-I'm gonna check on Connor.
-Well, he's sleeping.

41:10.000 --> 41:11.956
That's a surprise.

41:13.120 --> 41:17.159
I thought for sure she was
meant to be with Angel.

41:17.320 --> 41:21.154
I guess you never
can predict those things.

41:21.480 --> 41:23.072
You know?

41:25.280 --> 41:29.751
No, I guess you never can.
