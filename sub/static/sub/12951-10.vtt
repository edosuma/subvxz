WEBVTT

00:03.436 --> 00:05.936
Previously on "Alias"...

00:13.902 --> 00:16.135
Okay, Dixon, I'm in.

00:16.136 --> 00:17.302
Stand by.

00:17.303 --> 00:23.394
Sydney, you're looking for
Vasili Kabilov, I.D. tag C-16.

00:25.000 --> 00:31.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:36.003 --> 00:37.235
What's going on?

00:37.236 --> 00:39.827
We just heard about
the codes you acquired.

00:39.936 --> 00:42.731
They have nothing to do
with troop communications.

00:42.837 --> 00:45.961
They're the control codes
for six nuclear warheads

00:46.069 --> 00:48.864
that the Uzbeks and Intelligence
have confirmed

00:48.970 --> 00:50.702
went missing six months ago.

00:50.703 --> 00:52.669
Do you know where the nukes are?

00:52.670 --> 00:53.569
Yes, I do.

00:53.570 --> 00:54.936
They're in Kashmir,

00:54.937 --> 00:59.426
under what used to be
a maximum-security prison camp.

00:59.570 --> 01:01.769
You're gonna lead us
into that prison.

01:01.770 --> 01:03.535
I handed those codes to SD-6.

01:03.536 --> 01:06.660
Your guilt is unfounded.
You were doing your job.

01:06.770 --> 01:08.369
I'm going, Dad.

01:08.370 --> 01:10.402
I am not about
to let Irina Derevko

01:10.403 --> 01:13.766
near six nuclear weapons
supervised only by you.

01:15.170 --> 01:17.761
If you're lying,
none of us will survive.

01:17.870 --> 01:20.994
The only reason you know
about the nukes is me.

01:21.104 --> 01:22.936
We'll miss our window
unless you jump!

01:22.937 --> 01:25.437
Shut up!

01:36.404 --> 01:38.470
Right now we have
six suitcase nukes

01:38.471 --> 01:40.769
that are going to be
activated tomorrow.

01:40.770 --> 01:43.634
- Is that confirmed?
- CIA doesn't have any details.

01:48.437 --> 01:49.802
This is Mountaineer.

01:49.803 --> 01:54.235
Listen to me, fighter planes are
in the sky. You have to leave.

02:24.304 --> 02:26.861
We've got the cores. Tell them
to call off the air strikes!

02:28.437 --> 02:30.803
This is Vaughn.
Abort the air strikes.

02:30.804 --> 02:33.304
Abort the air strikes.

02:47.005 --> 02:50.869
When I found out
my mother faked her death

02:50.971 --> 02:53.004
20 years ago,

02:53.005 --> 02:57.266
after mourning her for most of
my life, she was still alive,

02:57.372 --> 03:01.099
I tried to imagine
what it would feel like

03:01.205 --> 03:05.637
to stand in a room
with both of my parents again.

03:06.938 --> 03:09.438
It seemed impossible.

03:11.438 --> 03:18.098
That two people with so much
deceit between them

03:18.205 --> 03:22.933
could ever find a way
to breathe the same air.

03:24.205 --> 03:28.035
And all of a sudden, there
we were, just the three of us.

03:30.405 --> 03:35.632
Walking down a dirt road
in the middle of Kashmir.

03:35.739 --> 03:42.160
When we were out there working
as a team, it was comforting.

03:44.672 --> 03:49.001
We were ambushed,
and we fought back.

03:50.605 --> 03:53.105
And we survived.

03:53.172 --> 03:56.968
Yeah, my parents and I sort of
went through the same thing.

04:01.039 --> 04:03.664
Thanks.
Thanks a lot.

04:11.705 --> 04:13.738
Vaughn told me Devlin approved
you to do research

04:13.739 --> 04:16.704
if you pass the Moglin-Reich
Allegiance Test.

04:16.839 --> 04:20.498
This is your S.O.P. on where
to meet for the pickup.

04:20.605 --> 04:21.438
Remember to...

04:21.439 --> 04:23.939
Drop it. Yeah.

04:24.805 --> 04:26.338
- Hey.
- What's up?

04:26.339 --> 04:28.839
Hey, where you been?

04:30.006 --> 04:32.767
Listen, every time
I walk in the room lately,

04:32.872 --> 04:35.105
you guys hush up
as if I'm interrupting.

04:35.106 --> 04:37.105
- I mean, am I?
- What? No.

04:37.106 --> 04:40.162
We were just talking.
Why don't you have a seat?

04:40.272 --> 04:43.102
I can't.
I forgot my keys.

04:43.206 --> 04:45.728
I gotta open the restaurant.

04:45.873 --> 04:47.171
I'll see you.

04:47.172 --> 04:49.672
Yeah.

05:15.639 --> 05:20.469
Kendall's allowed me
15 minutes here, twice a week.

05:22.107 --> 05:26.232
You put in the request, didn't
you, to give me time out here?

05:26.340 --> 05:28.505
Yeah.

05:28.506 --> 05:31.733
We appreciated
your help in Kashmir.

05:33.107 --> 05:35.698
I need you to understand.

05:37.073 --> 05:40.470
I was 18 when the KGB
recruited me.

05:44.173 --> 05:46.968
For a woman to be asked
to serve her country,

05:47.073 --> 05:48.139
it was a future.

05:48.140 --> 05:52.868
It meant empowerment,
independence.

05:54.240 --> 05:59.501
I was a fool to think
that any ideology

05:59.607 --> 06:02.300
could come before my daughter.

06:06.340 --> 06:08.840
Sydney?

06:10.007 --> 06:12.406
- Stand down!
- Back off now!

06:12.407 --> 06:15.702
Let me see your hands!
Keep them up!

06:25.340 --> 06:28.737
What is this?
We have an arrangement.

06:28.874 --> 06:32.033
Yes, the one you failed
to live up to.

06:32.141 --> 06:36.505
Our operation in Kashmir
was a waste of SD-6 resources.

06:37.108 --> 06:39.608
We acquired nothing.

06:42.741 --> 06:47.435
So, my question is,
have you betrayed me,

06:47.540 --> 06:50.438
or are you simply incompetent?

06:51.074 --> 06:54.972
This interrogation technique was
developed by the Khmer Rouge.

06:55.741 --> 06:59.866
Minimize bruising
on political prisoners

07:00.008 --> 07:02.940
when they were allowing them
to be photographed.

07:03.074 --> 07:07.836
You see, if I pull this
just a little harder,

07:07.941 --> 07:13.134
the glass will break,
and I do not want to do that.

07:14.041 --> 07:14.773
So tell me.

07:14.774 --> 07:18.763
Do you think we were unlucky
on our first venture together?

07:20.041 --> 07:25.064
Or do you have another plan
that you want to tell me about?

07:33.041 --> 07:35.506
I didn't betray you.

07:35.541 --> 07:38.041
We agreed to combine
our efforts.

07:38.708 --> 07:41.367
I swear to you.
That's still my intent.

07:42.742 --> 07:45.207
Then tell me,
what went wrong in Kashmir?

07:45.208 --> 07:48.332
The Indian Western Command
carried out an air strike

07:48.441 --> 07:49.874
on the PRF prison.

07:49.875 --> 07:53.034
The Rambaldi artifact
was destroyed.

07:53.641 --> 07:56.141
My contact in the region,
Gerard Cuvee,

07:56.175 --> 07:59.198
believes I tipped
the Indian authorities off.

08:00.875 --> 08:02.707
With all due respect, sir,

08:02.708 --> 08:05.265
could the leak have come
from this office?

08:06.541 --> 08:10.029
Sloane has no idea you sabotaged
the operation in Kashmir?

08:10.175 --> 08:12.408
If he did, we wouldn't be
having this conversation.

08:12.409 --> 08:14.966
since Sark failed
to deliver on his promise,

08:15.075 --> 08:17.575
their partnership
may not last for long.

08:17.610 --> 08:20.097
Unfortunately,
it isn't over yet.

08:20.209 --> 08:24.436
Sloane is sending me to Paris
with Sark tonight.

08:26.075 --> 08:26.674
Why?

08:26.675 --> 08:28.475
The Echelon Satellite System.

08:28.476 --> 08:32.067
Phone calls, E-mails, faxes
from around the world

08:32.174 --> 08:35.299
are filtered through a program
capable of flagging words

08:35.409 --> 08:36.541
on an N.S.A. list.

08:36.542 --> 08:39.042
Echelon has been
immeasurably successful

08:39.109 --> 08:43.234
in indicating threats
to our national security.

08:43.376 --> 08:45.742
Mr. Sark has provided
new intelligence

08:45.743 --> 08:48.074
indicating that an enemy
of this country

08:48.075 --> 08:51.507
may have acquired the ability
to access this terminal.

08:52.642 --> 08:55.107
Gerard Cuvee.

08:55.142 --> 08:57.937
Former leader of the People's
Revolutionary Front,

08:58.042 --> 09:00.408
a crime syndicate
whose headquarters

09:00.409 --> 09:03.375
were raided by
Indian authority last week.

09:03.476 --> 09:06.600
My dealings with Mr. Cuvee
go back several years.

09:06.709 --> 09:10.573
He showed me an Echelon terminal
he stole from the N.S.A.

09:10.676 --> 09:13.142
that he keeps
at a front company in Paris.

09:13.143 --> 09:15.870
Attention by local authorities
led Cuvee to believe

09:16.010 --> 09:17.109
I betrayed him.

09:17.110 --> 09:20.371
He's sure to move the terminal
to an undisclosed location.

09:20.476 --> 09:22.976
Surveillance intercepted
an operations log

09:23.010 --> 09:25.874
indicating an armored transport
has been scheduled

09:25.976 --> 09:28.109
for a pickup tomorrow afternoon.

09:28.110 --> 09:30.608
We believe that's when they'll
be moving the terminal.

09:30.609 --> 09:34.507
Sydney, you and Sark will
intercept the convoy en route

09:34.609 --> 09:37.404
and bring the terminal
back here safely.

09:39.043 --> 09:41.309
If Sloane
gets ahold of that terminal,

09:41.310 --> 09:43.901
The Alliance will eavesdrop
on corporations,

09:44.010 --> 09:45.842
law enforcement,
political campaigns.

09:45.843 --> 09:49.138
The potential for blackmail
would be unlimited.

09:49.243 --> 09:50.576
What's my countermission?

09:50.577 --> 09:54.134
I'll have Technical Services
provide a deletion program.

09:54.243 --> 09:56.342
You'll upload it
onto the terminal.

09:56.343 --> 09:59.309
When SD-6 turns it on,
it'll wipe the hard drive clean.

09:59.410 --> 10:01.910
Sloane will think Cuvee
installed a fail-safe

10:02.010 --> 10:04.510
to prevent unauthorized access.

10:06.343 --> 10:08.242
I'll do it on the return flight.

10:08.243 --> 10:09.609
Sark and I are traveling
separately

10:09.610 --> 10:12.633
to make sure no one
can connect him to SD-6.

10:15.377 --> 10:17.509
Oh, by the way,
I'm meeting with Will

10:17.510 --> 10:20.010
to help him prep
for his psych evaluation.

10:21.110 --> 10:23.576
Thank you.

10:23.577 --> 10:24.642
And I like it.

10:24.643 --> 10:27.143
- What?
- Your new suit.

10:27.810 --> 10:30.776
Oh. It's not new.
I just don't wear it that often.

10:30.877 --> 10:33.377
I came from a funeral.

10:34.710 --> 10:37.210
Alice's father died.

10:38.777 --> 10:41.277
I'm sorry.

10:42.211 --> 10:44.609
- How is she doing?
- Okay.

10:44.610 --> 10:48.064
Well, not really,
but she'll be fine.

10:48.177 --> 10:50.677
Let me know
if you need anything.

11:00.311 --> 11:03.277
Miss Bristow, hi, I know
you have a plane to catch,

11:03.378 --> 11:05.676
but you mind
doing a favor for me?

11:05.677 --> 11:08.268
Okay, will you take some
snapshots around Paris

11:08.378 --> 11:10.743
with that for me?

11:10.744 --> 11:12.709
We have to maintain our cover.

11:12.710 --> 11:14.943
My mom thinks I run
I.T. Services for the bank.

11:14.944 --> 11:18.137
So I like to composite myself
into photographs for her.

11:18.244 --> 11:20.744
I actually have an example.

11:20.777 --> 11:22.377
There's me and The Sphinx.

11:22.378 --> 11:24.876
I never actually
left Southern California,

11:24.877 --> 11:26.744
but I like to show my mom

11:26.745 --> 11:29.472
all the places I've never
really been to.

11:29.611 --> 11:31.310
Would you mind?

11:31.311 --> 11:32.377
Not at all.

11:32.378 --> 11:34.043
Okay.
Have a safe trip.

11:34.044 --> 11:36.443
I don't like to fly, personally,

11:36.444 --> 11:40.171
but that's why I'm here
and you're...

11:40.277 --> 11:42.777
I got some stuff to do.

11:55.544 --> 11:58.271
Convoy's on the move.
E.T.A. five minutes.

12:01.112 --> 12:02.710
I'm right behind the truck.

12:02.711 --> 12:05.211
Copy that.
I'm in position.

12:11.745 --> 12:13.977
It's a pity we're
traveling separately.

12:13.978 --> 12:14.977
We could have used
the opportunity

12:14.978 --> 12:16.378
to get to know each
other better.

12:16.379 --> 12:18.577
Yeah, I'm broken up
about that, too.

12:18.578 --> 12:21.169
You're adept at keeping
your curiosity in check.

12:21.278 --> 12:22.610
Don't flatter yourself.

12:22.611 --> 12:26.736
I'm referring to the fact your
mother and I worked together

12:26.845 --> 12:29.345
before she went into hiding.

12:30.711 --> 12:32.744
I learned a lot from her.

12:32.745 --> 12:35.768
In some ways, I think of her
as a mother myself.

12:37.045 --> 12:38.444
Listen to me.

12:38.445 --> 12:41.842
You and I have nothing
in common.

12:41.978 --> 12:44.876
We're not friends.
We're not gonna become friends.

12:44.978 --> 12:48.239
You won't bait me with stories
about a woman I never knew.

12:48.345 --> 12:50.902
I don't get any consideration
at all for the fact that

12:51.012 --> 12:53.534
I didn't tell Sloane
you conspired to kill him?

12:53.645 --> 12:56.872
You can't expose me
without exposing yourself.

12:56.978 --> 13:00.842
Now I'm almost into the city's
traffic-control network.

13:00.946 --> 13:03.468
Get your head into the game.

13:23.879 --> 13:26.045
How are your wounds healing?

13:26.046 --> 13:29.307
You obviously had the chance
to betray us in Kashmir,

13:29.412 --> 13:31.912
but you didn't.

13:32.379 --> 13:35.708
I don't imagine that means
you decided to trust me.

13:37.346 --> 13:42.335
Our previous dealings would
indicate that your strategy here

13:42.479 --> 13:44.278
may be long-term.

13:44.279 --> 13:47.540
So for now, I trust that
your behavior’s predictable.

13:47.645 --> 13:50.543
By "previous dealings,"
you mean our marriage?

13:53.113 --> 13:59.103
You know, technically, we
may still be husband and wife.

14:04.413 --> 14:06.412
I'm sorry.

14:06.413 --> 14:09.469
Sydney's on assignment
with Sark.

14:09.580 --> 14:12.205
It's my belief that he's
still working for you.

14:12.346 --> 14:18.176
You've coordinated your efforts
to infiltrate SD-6 and the CIA.

14:18.279 --> 14:21.972
Whatever you have in mind,
I promise you, it won't work.

14:22.780 --> 14:25.280
So I'm gonna offer you a deal.

14:26.780 --> 14:28.379
I'll see you're relocated

14:28.380 --> 14:30.880
to a private residence
on Puget Sound,

14:30.947 --> 14:33.777
under 24-hour surveillance,
of course.

14:33.880 --> 14:36.812
The illusion of freedom
is better than none at all.

14:37.680 --> 14:38.912
In exchange?

14:38.913 --> 14:40.712
In exchange, you'll confess,

14:40.713 --> 14:43.645
tell us what you're
really doing here,

14:43.747 --> 14:46.247
why you've turned yourself in.

14:50.147 --> 14:54.011
I'll give you time
to consider my offer.

15:09.713 --> 15:11.513
I see you.

15:11.514 --> 15:14.014
I'm turning the intersection
to red.

15:29.581 --> 15:32.081
It is 2-for-1 day
at Marshall's Tech Emporium.

15:32.147 --> 15:36.011
Not only is this capable of
penetrating two meters of steel,

15:36.114 --> 15:39.238
but it will also come equipped
with a tear-gas munition,

15:39.347 --> 15:41.113
which will disable the guards.

15:41.114 --> 15:43.614
Operators standing by.
Hello!

15:48.014 --> 15:50.480
I'm moving in to disable
the escort car.

15:50.481 --> 15:52.981
Copy that.

16:37.015 --> 16:38.180
Police! Police!

16:38.181 --> 16:40.738
Police! Police!

16:49.415 --> 16:52.642
It's empty.
The terminal's not there.

16:52.749 --> 16:55.249
The truck's a decoy.

17:32.682 --> 17:35.182
Get in the car!

18:13.016 --> 18:14.148
I got your message.

18:14.149 --> 18:16.649
Yes, come in.
I want you to meet someone.

18:16.683 --> 18:19.739
Jack Bristow,
this is Ariana Kane.

18:21.416 --> 18:24.382
Ms. Kane is the head of
Alliance Counterintelligence.

18:24.483 --> 18:29.074
She is the one who plugged
the leak last year at SD-9.

18:29.182 --> 18:32.171
Impressive, particularly
considering the guilty party

18:32.282 --> 18:34.615
attempted to frame you
as the mole.

18:34.616 --> 18:38.241
Men always call women crazy when
caught with their pants down.

18:38.383 --> 18:40.016
Ms. Kane is here to investigate

18:40.017 --> 18:42.515
the events leading up
to Emily's disappearance

18:42.516 --> 18:44.849
and the attempts
to blackmail me.

18:44.850 --> 18:46.448
How much have you shared
with him?

18:46.449 --> 18:48.949
He knows everything I know.

18:49.017 --> 18:52.949
I'm aware of your reputation
as a first-class strategist.

18:53.050 --> 18:56.607
Tell me, where would you begin
this investigation?

18:56.716 --> 18:59.216
With me.

18:59.483 --> 19:01.415
Arvin's trusted me
with everything

19:01.416 --> 19:03.916
I'd need to know
to be the perpetrator.

19:03.983 --> 19:06.881
If his standing within
The Alliance were undermined,

19:06.983 --> 19:09.483
I'd be a candidate
to inherit his seat.

19:09.518 --> 19:10.915
Motive.

19:10.916 --> 19:13.016
Well, that's a hell
of an answer.

19:13.017 --> 19:15.249
It's the only thing you can say

19:15.250 --> 19:17.875
to diminish
your viability as a suspect.

19:18.017 --> 19:19.483
Not really.

19:19.484 --> 19:22.813
Your awareness of game theory
would invalidate my approach.

19:22.916 --> 19:26.075
Therefore, the best course
of action to take as a suspect

19:26.183 --> 19:28.774
is to simply tell the truth.

19:33.217 --> 19:36.614
Well, as soon as you've
officially eliminated

19:36.717 --> 19:40.012
the possibility of Agent Bristow
as a suspect,

19:40.117 --> 19:43.640
I'm sure he'll be quite happy to
assist in your investigation.

19:43.751 --> 19:45.416
Of course.

19:45.417 --> 19:47.917
If you'll excuse me.

19:48.283 --> 19:49.282
A pleasure.

19:49.283 --> 19:51.783
All mine.

19:53.784 --> 19:56.807
You ever have a dream
where you're back at school

19:56.917 --> 20:01.212
and they won't let you graduate
because you failed a test?

20:01.317 --> 20:03.182
I had that last night.

20:03.183 --> 20:06.115
We don't screen for knowledge.
It's a psych profile.

20:06.217 --> 20:10.376
So I can't fail, but I can
find out I'm a sociopath.

20:10.484 --> 20:13.813
Some of the questions
on the test may seem shocking.

20:13.917 --> 20:17.679
Like things you might punch
someone out at a bar for asking.

20:19.550 --> 20:24.312
I don't want to get ahead of
myself, but if things go my way,

20:24.417 --> 20:25.416
what's next?

20:25.417 --> 20:27.882
You're cleared to read
classified documents,

20:27.917 --> 20:30.712
and you get a government salary,
which isn't much.

20:30.817 --> 20:34.044
Compared to what I make now,
it's much.

20:34.151 --> 20:37.810
And be honest. If you're caught
in a lie, you're disqualified.

20:37.917 --> 20:40.439
since we don't know how often
SD-6 keeps tabs on you,

20:40.551 --> 20:42.816
it's too risky to take the test
at a Federal building.

20:42.817 --> 20:45.374
We've arranged for you to go
to one of our fronts.

20:45.485 --> 20:49.178
When you get there, the officer
will lead you in the back room.

20:49.284 --> 20:51.617
He'll tell you the shipping
manifest was lost

20:51.618 --> 20:53.783
and that he needs your help.

20:53.784 --> 20:57.113
He'll take you back, and that's
where you'll take the test.

20:57.218 --> 20:58.517
There's no time limit.

20:58.518 --> 21:01.018
It shouldn't take
more than an hour.

21:03.951 --> 21:06.451
I can't believe
the questions they asked.

21:06.486 --> 21:08.450
Who would you rather kill?

21:08.451 --> 21:11.349
"A" your mother,
"B" your father, "C" yourself,

21:11.451 --> 21:13.817
and "none of the above"
wasn't an option.

21:13.818 --> 21:15.183
What does that measure?

21:15.184 --> 21:17.775
How you see yourself
in relation to authority.

21:17.885 --> 21:21.510
Whether or not you'd sacrifice
your life for your country.

21:21.618 --> 21:23.450
Now, that actually makes sense.

21:23.451 --> 21:26.417
I got Francie tickets to the
Hollywood Bowl for her birthday

21:26.551 --> 21:27.550
from both of us.

21:27.551 --> 21:30.051
Great. Thank you.

21:30.551 --> 21:34.642
You know, she was right
about what she said.

21:35.685 --> 21:37.884
We used to tell
each other everything.

21:37.885 --> 21:39.550
I can't tell her anything.

21:39.551 --> 21:42.051
I hate it, too.

21:42.718 --> 21:45.240
But after Danny
and what happened to you,

21:45.352 --> 21:47.784
I've accepted that
it's a gesture of love

21:47.785 --> 21:50.285
to deceive the people
I care about.

21:59.818 --> 22:02.318
What?

22:02.319 --> 22:04.084
Hey, what are you doing here?

22:04.085 --> 22:05.418
Rita, right?

22:05.419 --> 22:07.418
Alice, hi.

22:07.419 --> 22:08.418
- Hi.
- Hey, Rita.

22:08.419 --> 22:11.283
- Hey. This is Will.
- Hey.

22:11.386 --> 22:12.884
Michael.
Nice to meet you.

22:12.885 --> 22:15.084
- Nice to meet you.
- Hi. Alice.

22:15.085 --> 22:16.418
Hi.

22:16.419 --> 22:19.385
Michael and I work together
at the State Department.

22:19.486 --> 22:21.951
I was so sorry
to hear about your dad.

22:21.952 --> 22:24.452
Oh. Thank you.

22:24.719 --> 22:27.219
Michael's been amazing.

22:28.052 --> 22:31.643
He's an amazing guy.

22:38.652 --> 22:40.618
Oh, Rita, we're gonna be late.

22:40.619 --> 22:42.084
We got to go.
I'm sorry.

22:42.085 --> 22:43.284
Oh, it's no problem.

22:43.285 --> 22:45.685
It was nice running
into you guys.

22:45.686 --> 22:48.019
You too.

22:48.020 --> 22:50.520
- Bye.
- See you.

23:01.786 --> 23:04.718
The Echelon access terminal
that you retrieved in Paris

23:04.819 --> 23:07.909
was rigged with
a boot-sector fail-safe.

23:08.053 --> 23:11.678
When we turned it on,
the hard drive was erased.

23:11.819 --> 23:13.618
The good news is Mr. Cuvee

23:13.619 --> 23:16.085
is no longer in possession
of the terminal.

23:16.086 --> 23:19.075
The bad news is that he may
still have a way

23:19.186 --> 23:20.519
to access Echelon.

23:20.520 --> 23:21.585
One of Cuvee's men

23:21.586 --> 23:24.575
placed a call to a data-storage
facility in London.

23:24.686 --> 23:27.345
This facility caters
to high-end clients.

23:27.453 --> 23:30.317
It's likely Cuvee duplicated
the Echelon software

23:30.420 --> 23:33.113
and had them stored
in a secure server there.

23:33.220 --> 23:35.720
He could reverse engineer
a new terminal.

23:35.819 --> 23:37.985
Sydney, you'll acquire the files

23:37.986 --> 23:40.486
and delete them
from Cuvee's backup server.

23:40.487 --> 23:45.181
Mr. Sark has provided Marshall
with tech specs on the facility.

23:45.286 --> 23:47.786
Actually, yeah,
actually, about that.

23:47.854 --> 23:50.820
The facility's wired
with electronic countermeasures,

23:50.919 --> 23:54.043
and the computer's secured
via military-grade encryption.

23:54.153 --> 23:57.585
Any decryption device or
radio contact would be detected.

23:57.687 --> 23:59.386
The only way the terminal
can be accessed

23:59.387 --> 24:02.819
is by someone who knows how to
crack polymorphic algorithms.

24:02.920 --> 24:05.319
My math skills may be
above average,

24:05.320 --> 24:07.352
but I can't do calculus
in my head.

24:07.353 --> 24:10.251
That's why you're going in
with Marshall.

24:11.920 --> 24:14.420
Marshall who?

24:17.154 --> 24:18.352
Wait a minute.
What?

24:18.353 --> 24:20.552
You're the only one qualified
to hack the server

24:20.553 --> 24:22.519
without an electronic device.

24:22.520 --> 24:24.953
I can't go because
I'm not field rated.

24:24.954 --> 24:26.919
You will be
by the time you leave.

24:26.920 --> 24:29.353
Sark will help you review
the parameters.

24:29.354 --> 24:33.013
I'm sure Sydney will take
very good care of you.

24:40.354 --> 24:41.552
We got your debrief.

24:41.553 --> 24:44.075
If Marshall succeeds
in copying those files,

24:44.187 --> 24:46.286
Sloane will reboot the terminal.

24:46.287 --> 24:48.286
Marshall has
a photographic memory.

24:48.287 --> 24:52.151
Once the files flash across
the screen, he'll remember them.

24:52.254 --> 24:55.015
I can't just give SD-6
a fake Marshall.

24:56.221 --> 24:58.053
No.

24:58.054 --> 25:01.020
But we can pull him out of SD-6.

25:01.121 --> 25:01.754
What?

25:01.755 --> 25:06.278
Devlin made it clear we cannot
allow SD-6 to access Echelon.

25:06.388 --> 25:08.888
Sabotaging the mission
is risky after Kashmir.

25:08.987 --> 25:11.646
Sloane could start
to suspect something.

25:13.454 --> 25:16.181
We've considered
every option, Syd.

25:17.021 --> 25:19.521
There's no other way to do this.

25:24.621 --> 25:26.487
When you and Marshall return,

25:26.488 --> 25:28.920
we'll take him
into protective custody.

25:28.921 --> 25:31.478
He'll be transported
to Langley for a debrief.

25:31.588 --> 25:36.952
As ridiculous as this sounds,
SD-6 is his whole life.

25:38.221 --> 25:39.221
It's never easy

25:39.222 --> 25:42.551
finding out everything
you believe in is a Lie.

25:42.654 --> 25:46.142
We'll do whatever we can to make
it easier for him, I promise.

25:46.255 --> 25:48.755
And he'll have the option
to work for us.

25:48.855 --> 25:52.116
What about his mother? Will
they be able to make contact?

25:52.222 --> 25:56.313
That will be up to Marshall, but
we can bring her into custody.

25:58.455 --> 26:00.454
What's my cover story
with Sloane?

26:00.455 --> 26:04.353
As far as you'll know, the
mission went without a hitch.

26:04.455 --> 26:07.545
We'll intercept Marshall
on his way home.

26:07.654 --> 26:08.987
I should pack.

26:08.988 --> 26:12.215
Listen, about the bar.

26:13.955 --> 26:16.455
Did you see the security camera?

26:17.788 --> 26:19.754
We sent an agent
to pull the tapes

26:19.755 --> 26:22.187
so we couldn't be tied together.

26:22.188 --> 26:24.688
Good.

26:26.921 --> 26:28.421
Alice seems really nice.

26:28.422 --> 26:30.922
She said the same thing
about you.

26:49.122 --> 26:52.315
How long have you known
Arvin Sloane?

26:52.422 --> 26:54.254
For 30 years.

26:54.255 --> 26:57.812
When we met, he was my superior
at the CIA.

26:57.922 --> 27:02.047
Yes, and once he left the CIA,
he invited you to work at SD-6?

27:02.189 --> 27:05.212
Yes. We were disillusioned
with the U.S. government.

27:05.355 --> 27:07.188
We'd come to see it as corrupt.

27:07.189 --> 27:09.222
And we believed then
as we do now

27:09.223 --> 27:12.916
that The Alliance would succeed
in achieving global dominance.

27:13.023 --> 27:15.255
You have been so close
all these years.

27:15.256 --> 27:18.188
Why do you imagine
he recruited your daughter

27:18.289 --> 27:19.554
without telling you?

27:19.555 --> 27:22.214
Because he knew
I would have been opposed to it.

27:22.323 --> 27:26.448
Trust doesn't come easily
to Arvin Sloane.

27:26.555 --> 27:28.555
So while I may not have
approved,

27:28.556 --> 27:31.147
I now accept that
he recruited Sydney

27:31.256 --> 27:34.017
to ensure he'd never have to
take my loyalty on faith.

27:34.156 --> 27:36.656
You're asking me to believe
that Sloane

27:36.689 --> 27:39.813
took your daughter hostage
to ensure your friendship?

27:39.922 --> 27:42.389
In our line of work,
we can't just cry foul

27:42.390 --> 27:45.117
when things don't go our way.

27:50.023 --> 27:52.355
With whom have you had
intimate contact

27:52.356 --> 27:55.446
over the past 10 years,
Agent Bristow?

27:57.356 --> 27:59.589
I'm curious to know
where you're going.

27:59.590 --> 28:02.714
More secrets has been revealed through
pillow talk than torture.

28:02.823 --> 28:06.186
If there's a prostitute
or a stewardess out there

28:06.323 --> 28:10.255
you think may have heard you
in your sleep, I need to know.

28:10.390 --> 28:12.947
There is one way
for you to verify

28:13.090 --> 28:16.283
if my nocturnal activities
are a security risk, Ms. Kane,

28:16.390 --> 28:19.844
but somehow I think we'd both
prefer the torture.

28:23.590 --> 28:27.249
What happened to that gentleman
I met in Sloane's office?

28:27.356 --> 28:30.412
He got tired of your
baseless accusations.

28:32.423 --> 28:34.923
Good.

28:35.590 --> 28:39.522
I don't trust anyone who doesn't
know when he's being insulted.

28:39.656 --> 28:42.156
Are we through?

28:45.556 --> 28:47.889
Yes.

28:47.890 --> 28:50.390
For now.

28:58.224 --> 28:59.789
A.P.U. Set.

28:59.790 --> 29:01.690
Aft cargo heat.
Set.

29:01.691 --> 29:03.822
Hydraulic pumps. Set.

29:03.823 --> 29:04.956
What are you doing?

29:04.957 --> 29:08.286
I patched into the network
and logged onto the computer.

29:08.391 --> 29:11.948
I just want to make sure
the pilots don't miss anything.

29:13.424 --> 29:15.289
What was that?

29:15.290 --> 29:17.790
The flaps extending.
Totally routine.

29:17.858 --> 29:19.590
Is this your first time
on a plane?

29:19.591 --> 29:23.818
Yeah. I couldn't sleep, so I
memorized the flight ops manual.

29:25.691 --> 29:27.423
Sorry.

29:27.424 --> 29:28.923
Sorry.

29:28.924 --> 29:31.323
I'm just a little nervous.

29:31.324 --> 29:34.256
You're sweating.
You should take your jacket off.

29:34.357 --> 29:36.490
No way, no way.

29:36.491 --> 29:39.252
I compressed a high-glide
tactical parachute

29:39.357 --> 29:41.423
in the lining of my jacket.

29:41.424 --> 29:43.924
Don't worry.
My belt extends into a sling.

29:43.991 --> 29:47.014
Just loop it around your waist.
It will hold us both.

29:48.158 --> 29:49.224
Thanks.

29:49.225 --> 29:51.057
You don't have to thank me.

29:51.058 --> 29:55.422
It's my job to keep you safe.

29:57.891 --> 30:00.981
That is not a plane sound.
That could be bad.

30:01.091 --> 30:03.591
Marshall.

30:06.225 --> 30:09.520
Oh, a little kid playing.

30:09.624 --> 30:11.990
Is that all right?
Is he allowed?

30:11.991 --> 30:14.513
Onboard play.
You're not supposed to.

30:14.624 --> 30:17.124
Sorry.
Can I get a ginger ale?

30:26.692 --> 30:28.990
I don't think I've seen you
so handsome.

30:28.991 --> 30:32.286
And you look lovely, my dear.
Shall we?

30:32.392 --> 30:34.892
We shall.

30:37.358 --> 30:41.085
Whoa.
This is so cool.

30:42.392 --> 30:44.657
Hey, how's it going?
Good to see you.

30:44.658 --> 30:46.824
Hey, how's it going?
How you doing?

30:46.825 --> 30:48.824
Hi.
Nice to see you.

30:48.825 --> 30:51.915
The key to doing this right.
Be inconspicuous.

30:52.026 --> 30:54.992
Right, sorry. I just didn't.
Hey, how's it...

30:55.125 --> 30:57.391
You don't have to say hi
to everybody.

30:57.392 --> 31:00.789
Box seats have been reserved
at Royal Hall behind this man.

31:00.925 --> 31:03.482
Thatcher Powell,
Cuvee's head of I.T. Security

31:03.592 --> 31:06.387
and the only man with access
to his secure server.

31:06.492 --> 31:08.457
Powell attends
the London Philharmonic

31:08.458 --> 31:09.891
every third Saturday

31:09.892 --> 31:12.982
and takes in the performance
with a bottle of Cristal.

31:21.126 --> 31:26.717
You know,
Bach is my favorite composer.

31:28.692 --> 31:30.624
Are you speaking to me?

31:30.625 --> 31:34.387
I bet you didn't know that in
the last piece Bach composed,

31:34.493 --> 31:37.516
he encoded his name
into the musical notes.

31:37.625 --> 31:39.891
He was the most
ingenious composer

31:39.892 --> 31:41.325
of the Baroque movement.

31:41.326 --> 31:45.088
I always say, if it ain't
Baroque, don't fix it.

31:45.192 --> 31:47.851
Pardon my husband.
He does tend to prattle on.

31:47.959 --> 31:50.325
Sorry.

31:50.326 --> 31:51.991
Once Powell ingests
the scopolamine,

31:51.992 --> 31:54.617
it will take effect
in roughly five minutes.

31:56.925 --> 32:00.379
The idea is to make Powell
believe he merely fell asleep.

32:00.526 --> 32:01.825
The dose will be mild.

32:01.826 --> 32:05.656
Once you steal the access card,
get across town to the facility,

32:05.760 --> 32:07.525
download the Echelon software,

32:07.526 --> 32:10.582
and return the key to his pocket
before intermission.

32:10.693 --> 32:13.318
There will be a car
waiting for you out front.

32:38.127 --> 32:40.627
Psst.

32:50.427 --> 32:52.759
Oh, thank goodness
you're still open.

32:52.760 --> 32:56.123
I'm Marle Robinson. This is
my associate Frederick Fields.

32:56.227 --> 32:58.126
We work for Jennings Aerospace.

32:58.127 --> 33:00.126
The New York office
just paged me.

33:00.127 --> 33:02.459
Our CFO's laptop was stolen.

33:02.460 --> 33:04.659
We need access
to our backup server.

33:04.660 --> 33:06.659
May I have your P.I.N. number?

33:06.660 --> 33:09.160
86119.

33:09.260 --> 33:13.124
You're on server 13.
Second floor.

33:13.227 --> 33:16.852
Oh, thank you. We won't be
more than 10 minutes.

33:16.960 --> 33:19.687
SD-6 opened an account
at the data-storage facility

33:19.794 --> 33:21.760
under the name
Jennings Aerospace.

33:21.761 --> 33:24.059
Your client status
will get you past the desk,

33:24.060 --> 33:26.560
and the security staff will be
reduced for the night shift.

33:26.594 --> 33:28.326
since Cuvee is paranoid,

33:28.327 --> 33:30.792
he's leased out
the third floor as his own.

33:30.827 --> 33:34.259
You need to break into the third
floor to access the server.

33:34.360 --> 33:37.416
Syd, you were amazing.
You were acting, spying.

33:37.527 --> 33:40.049
- Ready to do your magic?
- I'm ready for anything.

33:40.193 --> 33:41.926
How did you get up here?

33:41.927 --> 33:43.359
This area's restricted.

33:48.394 --> 33:51.189
sir, you're going
to have to come with us.

33:57.794 --> 34:00.385
Syd, I've been shot!
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

34:00.494 --> 34:02.726
Oh, my God!
Syd, Syd, I've been shot!

34:02.727 --> 34:04.394
I'm shot!
Oh, my God!

34:04.395 --> 34:05.926
Marshall, Marshall.

34:05.927 --> 34:09.688
It's a tranq dart. I pulled it
out before you got a full dose.

34:09.793 --> 34:13.590
Thank God for the British
and their anti-gun laws, right?

34:13.726 --> 34:14.993
I'm okay, I'm okay.

34:14.994 --> 34:16.360
What were you saying?

34:16.360 --> 34:19.293
I think I said, "I can smell
you from here," in Ewok.

34:19.428 --> 34:20.393
Ewok.

34:20.395 --> 34:24.350
Official language of the
indigenous creatures on Endor.

34:25.061 --> 34:26.893
I think I peed myself a little.

34:26.893 --> 34:30.053
I mean, not a lot,
just like a little squirt.

34:30.161 --> 34:32.683
Marshall, stay with me.

34:32.793 --> 34:34.427
- Stay with me.
- I'm okay.

34:34.428 --> 34:35.627
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

34:35.628 --> 34:37.494
- You sure?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

34:37.495 --> 34:40.619
I got a little.
Let's walk. I can walk.

34:45.561 --> 34:47.793
Okay, okay, hang on.

34:47.795 --> 34:50.295
Hang on there.
Hang on.

34:51.828 --> 34:53.793
Okay.

34:53.795 --> 34:54.460
3.

34:54.460 --> 34:56.560
Okay, stay awake.
Stay awake.

34:56.561 --> 34:59.028
Come on, come on.
Come on, come on.

34:59.029 --> 35:01.586
Stay awake, stay awake,
stay awake.

35:04.062 --> 35:06.427
Marshall, focus!

35:06.428 --> 35:07.761
I love you.

35:07.762 --> 35:10.262
Ohh.

35:10.862 --> 35:13.228
The Echelon software
is on this computer.

35:13.229 --> 35:15.727
You have to access it.
I'll do the rest.

35:15.728 --> 35:17.761
Okay.
I got it, I got it.

35:17.762 --> 35:19.794
Go.

35:19.795 --> 35:20.927
I got it.

35:20.928 --> 35:24.257
It's all good.

35:32.528 --> 35:33.660
- Marshall!
- Hmm?

35:33.661 --> 35:36.161
Mama.

35:39.595 --> 35:42.459
Accounting for the relevant
state during generation

35:42.562 --> 35:46.517
combined with a random generator
will give you a password.

35:48.462 --> 35:50.962
Oh, Marshall, you're a genius.

35:56.895 --> 35:59.486
Thank you so much.

36:13.095 --> 36:15.428
Goodness.
I must have dozed off.

36:15.429 --> 36:18.156
Well, you certainly
weren't the only one.

36:48.896 --> 36:54.453
# And you know the light
is fading all too soon #

36:55.230 --> 36:57.496
So, this car will take you home.

36:57.497 --> 36:59.628
Okay, thanks.

36:59.629 --> 37:02.390
You think the driver
will take the scenic route?

37:02.530 --> 37:05.893
I've got this unbelievable
filmstrip running in my head.

37:05.996 --> 37:08.621
I still can't believe
that we're the stars.

37:08.729 --> 37:13.127
I want to watch a couple times
before I go back to my room.

37:13.230 --> 37:13.762
Sure.

37:13.763 --> 37:16.029
I got some
real pictures of London

37:16.030 --> 37:18.396
to show the folks back home now.

37:18.397 --> 37:21.885
# The beauty of the rain #

37:21.996 --> 37:23.895
# Is how it falls #

37:23.896 --> 37:25.796
# How it falls #

37:25.797 --> 37:29.229
# How it falls #

37:29.330 --> 37:31.262
# And there's nothing wrong #

37:31.263 --> 37:35.558
# But there is
something more #

37:38.096 --> 37:40.596
Marshall.

37:45.764 --> 37:48.264
See you soon, okay?

37:48.430 --> 37:50.930
Okay.

37:52.964 --> 37:55.464
Hey, you know the best part?

37:57.330 --> 38:01.887
I've never been prouder
to be one of the good guys.

38:01.997 --> 38:04.263
# Is how it falls #

38:04.264 --> 38:06.396
# How it falls #

38:06.397 --> 38:09.056
# How it falls #

38:16.431 --> 38:18.163
Yeah, Mom, I'll be home.

38:18.164 --> 38:22.119
I'm just getting back from
my big business trip in London.

38:22.231 --> 38:25.287
Yeah, Mom, of course
they fed me on the plane.

38:25.398 --> 38:28.159
I don't know.
It was some chicken or squid.

38:28.264 --> 38:29.630
Wait, hold on a second.

38:29.631 --> 38:30.896
Can you make a left?

38:30.897 --> 38:33.522
There's a nightclub
I want to drive by.

38:43.598 --> 38:44.663
What's going on?

38:44.664 --> 38:47.425
Surprise!

38:48.031 --> 38:51.190
This is why you guys shut up
when I walk in a room.

38:52.798 --> 38:55.298
Happy birthday.

38:56.398 --> 38:58.330
Oh, I love you so.

38:58.331 --> 39:00.797
Happy birthday, sweetie.

39:00.798 --> 39:03.298
Oh, my gosh!

39:03.531 --> 39:05.897
# The beast has come
to steal your heart #

39:05.898 --> 39:08.230
# So you better practice
your scream #

39:08.231 --> 39:11.095
# Or you may not live
your dreams #

39:11.197 --> 39:13.597
# Things will come
and things will go #

39:13.598 --> 39:17.996
# And one thing I know
for sure is that... #

39:18.098 --> 39:20.996
Jack Bristow is not
responsible for blackmailing me.

39:21.098 --> 39:23.330
His answers are too perfect.

39:23.331 --> 39:25.853
He even gets angry
when he makes sense.

39:25.965 --> 39:27.530
If he had nothing to do with it,

39:27.531 --> 39:29.964
I would expect his answers
to be perfect.

39:29.965 --> 39:31.197
Unless you have...

39:31.198 --> 39:33.164
Contrary to what you tell
your subordinates,

39:33.165 --> 39:34.797
we are not the government.

39:34.798 --> 39:39.253
I don't need probable cause.
All I need is a hunch.

39:39.365 --> 39:43.161
Your hunches notwithstanding,
you're talking about a man

39:43.265 --> 39:45.730
with whom I've been partnered
for 30 years.

39:45.731 --> 39:48.231
You have a blind spot
when it comes to him.

39:48.298 --> 39:50.798
He's not the first
suspect I interviewed.

39:50.898 --> 39:53.131
I talked to the heads
of the SD cells.

39:53.132 --> 39:55.859
People who might have taken
issue with your promotion.

39:55.965 --> 39:57.964
You know what I found?

39:57.965 --> 40:02.021
They're all afraid of you,
except for Jack Bristow,

40:02.132 --> 40:08.223
who, I promise you,
is hiding something.

40:17.766 --> 40:20.266
Have you thought about my offer?

40:27.399 --> 40:30.523
I have nothing to confess, Jack.

40:30.632 --> 40:32.898
I know you find it hard to
believe I'd turn myself in

40:32.899 --> 40:34.498
to make up for my mistakes.

40:34.499 --> 40:36.999
But that's the reason.

40:38.799 --> 40:41.299
The only reason I'm here.

40:42.033 --> 40:44.897
If that's the truth,
why didn't you simply refuse?

40:44.999 --> 40:49.556
I was considering whether or not
to fabricate a confession

40:49.665 --> 40:52.256
just to get out of this cell.

40:53.866 --> 40:56.366
You were right.

40:56.465 --> 40:57.965
Although our marital contract

40:57.966 --> 41:01.022
was founded
on fraudulent pretenses,

41:01.166 --> 41:04.030
it's still valid
until it's annulled,

41:04.133 --> 41:08.031
which means, technically,
we are still married.

41:11.099 --> 41:13.599
Jack.

41:14.533 --> 41:17.987
Thus far I've agreed to be
debriefed only by Sydney.

41:20.400 --> 41:25.525
From now on, I'm willing
to talk to you, too.

41:39.299 --> 41:41.799
Vaughn here.

41:43.199 --> 41:46.392
What do you mean we didn't
pick up Marshall? Who did?

41:56.199 --> 41:58.099
Oh, my God.

41:58.100 --> 42:00.565
Oh, my God.
Please don't hurt me.

42:00.566 --> 42:02.766
Mister.

42:02.767 --> 42:04.432
Mister, please.

42:04.433 --> 42:06.933
Please don't hurt me.

42:14.401 --> 42:18.492
Tell me, how did you enjoy
the symphony?
