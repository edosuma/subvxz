00:54.687 --> 00:56.086
<i>Once upon a time</i>.

00:56.156 --> 00:59.250
<i>There was a young Thumb Thumb</i>
<i>named Juni.</i>

00:59.325 --> 01:02.624
<i>Juni was shy and had no self-confidence.</i>

01:02.695 --> 01:08.395
<i>Until one day evil Thumb Thumbs</i>
<i>kidnapped his spy Thumb Thumb parents.</i>

01:08.468 --> 01:12.734
<i>It was up to Juni and his sister. Carmen.</i>
<i>To save Mom and Dad.</i>

01:12.806 --> 01:15.434
<i>And save them they did.</i>

01:16.409 --> 01:20.607
<i>Juni became a hero.</i>
<i>The best Thumb Thumb agent ever seen.</i>

01:21.514 --> 01:24.847
<i>But one day Juni was betrayed.</i>

01:24.918 --> 01:28.183
<i>He could not forgive the Thumb Thumbs</i>
<i>for using him.</i>

01:28.254 --> 01:32.520
<i>So he left Thumb village</i>.
<i>Vowing never to return.</i>

01:32.592 --> 01:36.289
<i>No one ever really</i>
<i>saw much of Juni after that.</i>

01:36.362 --> 01:39.991
<i>No one lived happily ever after.</i>

01:40.066 --> 01:41.727
<i>The end.</i>

01:44.604 --> 01:47.767
Wasn't that a marvelous story, children?

01:48.441 --> 01:54.744
Today's feature presentation
will also be in three dimensions.

01:54.814 --> 01:58.079
But for now, take off your glasses.

01:58.151 --> 02:00.051
You won't need them for about...

02:00.120 --> 02:01.985
ooh, 15 minutes or so.

02:02.055 --> 02:03.283
At that point,

02:03.356 --> 02:06.416
the movie becomes 3-D!

02:06.493 --> 02:09.586
Don't worry. You'll know
when to put your glasses on.

02:09.662 --> 02:14.224
When one of the main characters
puts his on, you do the same.

02:14.300 --> 02:18.498
Now, if your eyes get tired
during the 3-D section of the movie,

02:18.571 --> 02:21.062
take off your glasses,
rush out to the concession stand,

02:21.141 --> 02:23.200
purchase an extra large popcorn,
an extra large soda,

02:23.276 --> 02:25.403
come back to your seat,
put your glasses back on and <i>voil√†!</i>

02:25.478 --> 02:27.776
You just spent $35!

02:28.581 --> 02:31.345
Keep those glasses off until it's time.

02:31.417 --> 02:33.476
And enjoy the show!

02:46.199 --> 02:48.531
<i>Agua. As in water.</i>

02:48.601 --> 02:51.468
<i>Cute. But I wasn't here for cute.</i>

02:52.438 --> 02:57.171
<i>I was here 'cause I'd gotten</i>
<i>a call for my regular fee.</i>

02:57.744 --> 03:01.043
<i>$ 4.99</i>

03:01.114 --> 03:03.514
<i>I'm an ex-secret agent.</i>

03:03.583 --> 03:06.643
<i>My name is Juni Cortez.</i>

03:06.719 --> 03:09.210
<i>And I'm a private detective.</i>

03:09.289 --> 03:12.315
<i>A P.I.</i>
<i>A private eye.</i>

03:13.126 --> 03:14.787
<i>A gumshoe.</i>

03:19.098 --> 03:22.864
I know why the water
from your park is missing.

03:22.936 --> 03:25.564
- Pray tell.
- It's winter.

03:25.638 --> 03:28.698
They shut down the park
during the winter.

03:28.775 --> 03:30.743
Who's "they"?

03:30.810 --> 03:34.837
The people who really own this park.

03:36.783 --> 03:38.341
<i>Times are tough.</i>

03:38.418 --> 03:41.080
<i>But a guy's gotta do what he's gotta do.</i>

03:41.154 --> 03:43.486
<i>From saving cats in trees...</i>

03:45.625 --> 03:48.890
<i>...to finding lost toys.</i>

03:53.099 --> 03:55.158
<i>To helping people...</i>
<i>Hold on.</i>

03:55.235 --> 03:56.224
Yeah?

03:57.103 --> 03:59.264
The OSS is looking for me?

03:59.339 --> 04:02.866
Look, I'm no longer an agent.
I can't help you.

04:02.942 --> 04:05.342
Whatever it is, it's your problem.

04:05.411 --> 04:08.005
Leave me alone!

04:08.948 --> 04:13.351
<i>I'd been burned by the agency.</i>
<i>The OSS.</i>

04:13.419 --> 04:16.980
<i>So I left.</i>
<i>No going back.</i>

04:17.055 --> 04:19.853
<i>I handle my own assignments now.</i>

04:19.926 --> 04:21.791
<i>Smaller in scale.</i>

04:22.195 --> 04:25.028
<i>I was saving up for something big.</i>

04:25.098 --> 04:26.326
<i>I was standing in line</i>

04:26.399 --> 04:30.392
<i>to buy my copy of the biggest</i>
<i>Virtual-reality game in history.</i>

04:30.470 --> 04:35.339
<i>It goes online at midnight.</i>
<i>Pretty exciting. I suppose.</i>

04:35.408 --> 04:36.875
<i>Game Over.</i>

04:36.943 --> 04:39.673
<i>The biggest video game</i>
<i>to ever be created. Period.</i>

04:39.746 --> 04:41.338
<i>This is a worldwide event.</i>

04:41.414 --> 04:45.111
<i>The game was created by someone</i>
<i>known only as the Toymaker.</i>

04:45.184 --> 04:48.483
<i>Who was once again</i>
<i>unavailable for interviews.</i>

04:51.424 --> 04:56.487
<i>But there's gotta be some things</i>
<i>more important than games.</i>

05:00.533 --> 05:03.627
<i>Oh. And did we mention</i>
<i>the surprises the Toymaker has in store</i>

05:03.703 --> 05:07.571
<i>for those of you that complete level five?</i>

05:07.640 --> 05:14.068
<i>Untold riches. Toys. And prizes</i>
<i>beyond your wildest dreams.</i>

05:14.147 --> 05:16.513
Hey, no cutting in line, freak.

05:16.582 --> 05:19.050
I wasn't cutting.
I was standing right here!

05:19.118 --> 05:20.847
End of the line!

05:21.721 --> 05:23.689
<i>Needless to say.</i>

05:23.756 --> 05:26.953
<i>Things have been pretty lame</i>
<i>since I left the OSS.</i>

05:28.294 --> 05:29.283
Aah!

05:31.030 --> 05:33.590
<i>Things were about to get worse.</i>

05:44.777 --> 05:45.869
<i>Dear Juni.</i>

05:45.945 --> 05:48.971
<i>I was doing some work</i>
<i>and thought you might like these.</i>

05:49.048 --> 05:51.676
<i>Miniaturized sharks.</i>

05:51.751 --> 05:56.415
<i>Remember. They're still man-eaters. So</i>
<i>don't be poking your fingers in the bowl.</i>

05:56.489 --> 06:00.721
<i>Take care. If you guys</i>
<i>ever need anything. I'll be there.</i>

06:00.793 --> 06:01.691
<i>Romero.</i>

06:01.761 --> 06:05.322
Ralph, write a thank-you note
back to Romero.

06:16.676 --> 06:19.270
Behave, you guys.
No fighting.

06:30.189 --> 06:32.783
- Whatcha doin'?
- Hi, Gerti.

06:32.859 --> 06:36.295
I'm just doing nothing... again.

06:36.362 --> 06:38.830
- What's that?
- Mexican chocolate.

06:40.967 --> 06:43.629
- Where's your mom and dad?
- On an assignment.

06:43.703 --> 06:46.934
It was my idea not to be
part of the family business.

06:47.006 --> 06:50.032
They're all on missions.
Your sister, too, huh?

06:50.109 --> 06:54.102
I haven't seen Carmen
since Christmas... last year.

06:54.180 --> 06:57.013
You should join back up.
The OSS could really use you.

06:57.083 --> 06:59.847
- Yeah. Use me.
- Not what I meant.

06:59.919 --> 07:02.387
Don't hold on to the past, Juni.
Look at me.

07:02.455 --> 07:04.423
9 years old and nowhere to go but up.

07:04.490 --> 07:09.120
The only tribe worth belonging to
is the one that you're born into.

07:09.195 --> 07:12.130
Yeah, your family.
It's good to take care of your family.

07:12.198 --> 07:14.393
But remember one thing.

07:14.467 --> 07:16.799
Everyone's your family.

07:18.037 --> 07:20.767
That makes no sense.

07:25.478 --> 07:27.036
Hello, Juni.

07:27.113 --> 07:28.671
Mr. President.

07:28.748 --> 07:30.545
Oh, you can call me Devlin.

07:30.616 --> 07:34.211
Weren't you already running the country
when you were head of the OSS?

07:34.287 --> 07:35.515
I was running the country.

07:35.588 --> 07:39.684
But since the OSS is a secret
organization, no one knew it.

07:39.759 --> 07:42.159
I wanted the world to know
that I was in charge.

07:42.228 --> 07:44.696
So I became president
of the United States.

07:44.764 --> 07:47.358
It all depends upon your preference.

07:47.433 --> 07:50.197
Reality or perception.
Perception works for me.

07:50.269 --> 07:52.601
Well, I'm into reality.

07:52.672 --> 07:55.232
And the reality is, nothing you can say

07:55.308 --> 07:59.608
will make me rejoin the OSS.
That is why you called, isn't it?

07:59.679 --> 08:01.704
The OSS needs you to return.

08:01.781 --> 08:03.214
I'm retired.

08:03.282 --> 08:05.477
Well, who's living in perception now?

08:05.551 --> 08:07.781
The fact is there is no retirement.

08:07.854 --> 08:09.446
Once an agent, always an agent.

08:09.522 --> 08:11.922
It's time for you to be a big boy
and reinstate.

08:11.991 --> 08:15.449
With all due respect, sir, no.

08:15.528 --> 08:19.430
Then hold on to your seat,
because here's the reality:

08:19.499 --> 08:21.694
Your sister's missing.

08:30.676 --> 08:33.907
Taking Agent Cortez
to Games and Theory.

08:33.980 --> 08:36.813
That's ex-Agent Cortez.

08:39.852 --> 08:42.285
You know, that one's defective.

08:42.355 --> 08:45.347
Something's wrong with the shape.

08:45.424 --> 08:47.585
See if we can take that one back.

08:51.531 --> 08:53.192
Oh, man.

08:53.266 --> 08:54.494
We're on.

08:54.567 --> 08:55.932
We're on!

09:00.940 --> 09:02.339
Hello, Juni.

09:02.408 --> 09:05.206
Donnagon. Been a good boy lately?

09:05.278 --> 09:06.506
Yes.

09:06.579 --> 09:08.513
Very, very good.

09:08.581 --> 09:11.482
Mrs. Giggles must have
straightened you out.

09:13.052 --> 09:16.021
- I certainly did.
- Hello, Francesca.

09:16.088 --> 09:19.251
Yeah, she worked me over
pretty good, actually.

09:19.325 --> 09:21.953
- Aah.
- Darling, behave.

09:22.028 --> 09:25.327
What do you know about
a video game called Game Over?

09:25.398 --> 09:29.300
I know that just about every kid
in the world is gonna sign on and play it.

09:29.368 --> 09:32.462
Not if we can help it.
The game is a trap.

09:32.538 --> 09:34.836
Once plugged into the game,

09:34.907 --> 09:38.365
parents won't even be able to
get their children's attention.

09:38.444 --> 09:39.809
What else is new?

09:39.879 --> 09:40.971
This is different.

09:41.047 --> 09:44.983
Once you get through the game,
your mind belongs to the Toymaker.

09:45.051 --> 09:46.484
The inventor of the game.

09:46.552 --> 09:49.988
He wants to enslave
the world's youth with mind control.

09:50.056 --> 09:54.493
You control the youth,
you control the future of the world.

09:54.560 --> 09:57.654
She's an ingenious hacker, your sister.

09:57.730 --> 10:00.255
We sent her inside to shut down the game.

10:00.333 --> 10:04.360
But... she disappeared.

10:04.437 --> 10:06.962
How can she disappear inside a game?

10:07.039 --> 10:08.700
She didn't physically.

10:08.774 --> 10:11.368
Actually, she's right here in the building.

10:13.112 --> 10:15.376
Carmen! Carmen!

10:15.448 --> 10:19.077
She can't hear you.
Her mind's still in the game.

10:19.151 --> 10:22.882
She got as far as level four, then nothing.

10:22.955 --> 10:25.924
Why would she even go in there
without any backup?

10:25.992 --> 10:30.656
Because her first and only choice
wouldn't answer our calls.

10:30.730 --> 10:33.722
So she decided to go alone.

10:33.799 --> 10:37.326
Now, you go in.
Find your sister.

10:37.403 --> 10:40.270
Help her shut down the game in 12 hours,

10:40.339 --> 10:42.967
or it's game over for everyone.

10:43.909 --> 10:46.002
Are you with us?

10:47.146 --> 10:48.135
OK.

10:48.214 --> 10:49.647
Then let's go.

10:51.951 --> 10:55.409
So I have to shut down the game
but not release the Toymaker?

10:55.488 --> 10:58.548
Exactly. It would be catastrophic
if he escaped.

10:58.624 --> 11:02.583
The Toymaker hates us for imprisoning
him in cyberspace all these years.

11:02.662 --> 11:05.688
- What made you do that?
- Who knows? It was years ago.

11:05.765 --> 11:09.030
Now, you'll have to start
on level one like everyone else.

11:09.101 --> 11:12.764
Find your sister on level four.
Then proceed to level five.

11:12.838 --> 11:15.534
- Which is unwinnable.
- Level five is unwinnable?

11:15.608 --> 11:17.701
Level five is where
you shut down the game.

11:17.777 --> 11:19.404
If the game is not shut down,

11:19.478 --> 11:24.142
you'll stay trapped with everyone else
when the Toymaker takes over the world.

11:26.452 --> 11:28.010
Put on these glasses,

11:28.087 --> 11:31.682
and you'll enter the world of the game.

11:34.927 --> 11:37.953
You're being sent into a zero-gravity
chamber alongside Carmen.

11:38.030 --> 11:40.021
That should give you a competitive edge.

11:40.099 --> 11:42.397
When you're in the game,
things will feel real.

11:42.468 --> 11:43.526
Are they real?

11:43.602 --> 11:46.070
Good luck, Juni.

11:47.006 --> 11:49.065
Find Carmen. Shut down the game.

11:49.141 --> 11:53.202
And whatever you do,
don't let the Toymaker out.

12:09.161 --> 12:10.651
Ugh!

12:16.368 --> 12:18.768
Computer-generated.

12:22.708 --> 12:25.074
Low-res!

12:26.979 --> 12:29.539
<i>Carmen.</i>
<i>Carmen. Can you hear me?</i>

12:29.615 --> 12:32.311
<i>It's Juni. Your brother.</i>

12:33.786 --> 12:35.447
Ugh!

12:38.290 --> 12:40.417
Pogo Toads!

12:57.176 --> 12:59.736
Ugh! Ugh!

13:09.054 --> 13:10.043
Aah!

13:11.490 --> 13:12.479
Ugh!

13:30.776 --> 13:32.334
Ha!

13:35.881 --> 13:36.870
Ugh!

13:38.117 --> 13:40.881
Hey! Get your own ride, creepo!

13:40.953 --> 13:44.411
Sorry!
I thought you were a toad.

13:45.724 --> 13:47.055
New player, huh?

13:47.126 --> 13:49.094
Yeah.
New player.

13:49.161 --> 13:52.562
Well, here's a lesson you won't soon forget.

13:59.638 --> 14:01.731
Aah!

14:03.809 --> 14:05.470
How is he?

14:05.544 --> 14:07.478
His brain waves are normal.

14:07.546 --> 14:09.138
But how is he?

14:09.215 --> 14:11.945
Oh. He fell.

14:25.998 --> 14:27.625
<i>Stand up.</i>

14:30.903 --> 14:32.768
<i>You fell three stories.</i>

14:32.838 --> 14:34.965
Aah. I survived?

14:35.040 --> 14:38.601
<i>Not exactly.</i>
<i>That is your life count.</i>

14:40.212 --> 14:43.272
<i>After taking heavy damage. You lose a life.</i>

14:43.349 --> 14:45.180
What happens when I hit zero?

14:45.251 --> 14:47.219
<i>Game over.</i>

14:47.286 --> 14:52.622
<i>When you run out of life. You lose.</i>
<i>No replays. No restarts.</i>

14:54.193 --> 14:57.959
What happened to my 12 hours?
I only have four now.

14:58.030 --> 15:00.931
<i>Time flies when you're playing games.</i>

15:01.000 --> 15:02.627
This is crazy.

15:02.701 --> 15:04.430
<i>Better hurry.</i>

15:16.582 --> 15:17.913
Ugh!

15:21.587 --> 15:23.077
Aah!

15:27.459 --> 15:28.949
So who are you?

15:29.028 --> 15:32.520
I'm Juni Cortez,
ex-secret agent of the OSS.

15:32.598 --> 15:34.862
I need to get to level five.

15:34.934 --> 15:38.927
But I only have a few hours before
the Toymaker takes over the world.

15:39.004 --> 15:42.235
- Level five?
- Level five is unwinnable.

15:42.308 --> 15:44.503
I understand that.
But I have to save the world.

15:44.576 --> 15:48.478
Rez, this person thinks
he's level-five material.

15:48.547 --> 15:50.276
So I hear.

15:50.349 --> 15:54.718
You guys must be beta testers.

15:54.787 --> 15:59.247
One of the first allowed to roam free
these coveted digital hills, my friend.

15:59.325 --> 16:01.725
How can I offer service?

16:01.794 --> 16:03.921
I'm Rez.

16:06.565 --> 16:08.965
Hi, Rez.
Now, about saving the world.

16:09.034 --> 16:11.628
If anyone's gonna get
to the great prize at level five,

16:11.704 --> 16:12.966
it's gonna be one of us.

16:13.038 --> 16:15.063
Whatever.
I want cheat codes.

16:15.140 --> 16:18.735
Back-door entrances.
Shortcuts. Anything.

16:18.811 --> 16:21.302
I can pay you with bonus packs.

16:22.247 --> 16:25.148
Implementation of any form
of hack code or cheat boost

16:25.217 --> 16:26.912
will trigger an immediate game over

16:26.986 --> 16:28.851
and permanent evac from the game.

16:28.921 --> 16:30.115
It's in your tech manual.

16:30.189 --> 16:33.420
You have to play the game by the rules

16:33.492 --> 16:35.050
or not at all.

16:35.127 --> 16:36.424
All right.

16:36.495 --> 16:39.726
How do I get to level two
as quickly as possible?

16:39.798 --> 16:42.323
Lives are at stake. Please.

16:42.401 --> 16:45.268
See that target? Hit it.

16:45.337 --> 16:46.964
You'll bounce straight to the moon.

16:47.039 --> 16:49.701
Yeah. I'd suggest a running start.

16:49.775 --> 16:52.005
Level two is on the dark side
of the moon.

16:52.077 --> 16:55.911
The way to get there is by hitting
that target and bouncing to it.

16:55.981 --> 17:00.509
Not a lot of realism
in these games, is there?

17:04.690 --> 17:08.421
Won't be seeing him anymore.
Let's go.

17:08.493 --> 17:09.551
Less competition, the better.

17:11.130 --> 17:11.925
Aah!

17:11.997 --> 17:14.056
Aah! Ugh!

17:16.667 --> 17:18.329
Wow!

17:19.805 --> 17:21.829
Aah!

17:38.857 --> 17:41.348
Oh, great.

17:45.264 --> 17:49.200
<i>A message from the OSS.</i>
<i>Do you accept?</i>

17:50.135 --> 17:51.796
Mm-hm.

17:53.439 --> 17:56.602
OK, Juni, we can no longer be
of assistance.

17:56.675 --> 17:57.767
What assistance?

17:57.843 --> 17:59.868
You do get one additional lifeline,

17:59.945 --> 18:01.947
which you can choose to use now
or later.

18:01.947 --> 18:03.209
Now!
Give it to me now.

18:03.282 --> 18:06.342
You get to bring in
any one person from the outside

18:06.418 --> 18:07.851
to help you on your journey.

18:07.920 --> 18:09.547
Call up the family files.

18:10.189 --> 18:12.089
<i>Assertive. Athletic.</i>
<i>Knows karate.</i>

18:12.157 --> 18:13.124
<i>Intelligent.</i>

18:13.192 --> 18:14.523
<i>Strategic.</i>

18:14.593 --> 18:15.617
<i>Knows karate.</i>

18:15.694 --> 18:18.629
Wait a minute.
Go back to Grandpa.

18:18.697 --> 18:21.063
<i>Pros: Superior intellect.</i>

18:21.133 --> 18:23.465
<i>Cons: Physically disabled.</i>

18:23.535 --> 18:26.527
He's been paralyzed
from the waist down for 30 years.

18:26.605 --> 18:28.835
His energy force would have
doubled back again,

18:28.907 --> 18:33.367
making his arms, his heart, his brain
twice as strong as a normal person.

18:33.445 --> 18:36.539
- <i>What are you thinking. Sir?</i>
- I choose Grandpa.

18:36.615 --> 18:39.083
<i>Selected. One moment.</i>

18:45.023 --> 18:47.014
That was fast. Sort of.

18:48.227 --> 18:49.558
Grandpa!

18:49.628 --> 18:51.459
Juni!

18:51.530 --> 18:52.792
Where am I?

18:52.865 --> 18:57.063
In a video game run by a madman
called the Toymaker.

18:57.136 --> 18:59.297
The Toymaker is here?

18:59.371 --> 19:00.599
You know him?

19:01.206 --> 19:05.165
I've been hunting him down
for 30 years, Juni.

19:06.812 --> 19:09.975
- You shouldn't have brought me here.
- I needed your help.

19:10.048 --> 19:13.484
We have to find Carmen
and shut down the game.

19:14.286 --> 19:15.947
What is that?

19:16.922 --> 19:19.948
It's a power-up of some kind.

19:21.426 --> 19:22.916
Mega Legs.

19:23.896 --> 19:25.887
Give it to me.

19:36.475 --> 19:38.443
Grandpa?

19:43.315 --> 19:45.442
You can walk.

19:45.517 --> 19:48.179
No, Juni.

19:56.228 --> 19:59.288
Oh, I can do more than that.

20:00.098 --> 20:01.497
Wow.

20:09.141 --> 20:10.938
Hmm.

20:11.009 --> 20:12.670
Grandpa?

20:13.979 --> 20:15.708
Hmm.

20:18.884 --> 20:20.784
Where are you going?

20:20.852 --> 20:24.652
Don't wait for me, Juni.
I'll catch up with you.

20:24.723 --> 20:26.452
But we have to find...

20:27.426 --> 20:29.053
Carmen.

20:33.398 --> 20:35.958
Valentin, my old friend.

20:37.236 --> 20:40.694
You think you'll catch me
this time, don't you?

20:40.772 --> 20:42.763
Well...

20:44.543 --> 20:47.034
you will.

20:47.112 --> 20:50.843
Oh, you will.

20:56.622 --> 20:59.591
Everything falls into place.

21:01.460 --> 21:05.294
Everything falls.

21:39.131 --> 21:41.099
Wow.

21:42.701 --> 21:45.761
A courageous new contestant.
Welcome to the Robocon.

21:45.837 --> 21:46.997
I need to get to level two.

21:47.072 --> 21:48.972
Well, you came to the wrong place.

21:49.041 --> 21:50.702
This is the Arena of Misfortune.

21:50.776 --> 21:53.267
To get to level two, you're gonna
have to battle a Mech.

21:53.345 --> 21:54.369
How do I do that?

21:54.446 --> 21:56.971
I'll explain it to you
when you get up there.

22:03.855 --> 22:05.345
Hey, there.

22:05.424 --> 22:09.724
Just go out there
in your Battle Mech and fight.

22:17.002 --> 22:19.835
Wait a minute.
Who am I fighting?

22:19.905 --> 22:21.566
Her.

22:27.946 --> 22:31.973
Don't get too trashed
and I win bonus points.

22:45.931 --> 22:47.956
Right foot, left foot.

22:48.033 --> 22:50.331
Right foot. Oh!

22:51.470 --> 22:54.303
Oh! How do you work this thing?

23:04.116 --> 23:05.447
Ooh.

23:07.786 --> 23:10.050
- Ooh.

23:10.122 --> 23:12.386
<i>OK. I want a good. Clean robo fight.</i>

23:12.457 --> 23:16.791
<i>There will be no kidney punches.</i>
<i>No rabbit punches.</i>

23:16.862 --> 23:19.126
<i>No eye gouging or ear biting.</i>

23:19.197 --> 23:22.564
<i>Unless. Of course. You can't help yourself.</i>

23:24.069 --> 23:25.593
Hi.

23:27.172 --> 23:28.469
I'm Juni.

23:30.442 --> 23:32.205
Oh, I'm sorry.

23:32.277 --> 23:33.710
I'm sorry. He didn't mean it.

23:33.779 --> 23:35.178
Really, really.

23:36.615 --> 23:38.480
No. No, no, no!

23:38.550 --> 23:40.643
Please, no!

23:43.488 --> 23:44.477
Oh!

23:46.158 --> 23:47.625
Ugh!

24:05.677 --> 24:08.942
Hi. I'm Demetra.

24:58.530 --> 25:00.691
Aah!

25:08.139 --> 25:09.868
Help.

25:30.262 --> 25:33.322
Oh! That's gotta hurt.

26:39.798 --> 26:42.062
I'm the winner!

26:42.133 --> 26:43.259
Yeah!

26:43.335 --> 26:45.269
Whoo! Yes!

26:45.337 --> 26:47.305
Well, well, well.

26:47.372 --> 26:50.364
For a kid that doesn't know how to fight,

26:50.442 --> 26:52.672
you sure know how to fight.

26:52.744 --> 26:56.271
Congratulations.
And keep the suit.

26:57.882 --> 26:59.349
Hey! Hey!

26:59.851 --> 27:01.819
Hey!

27:04.522 --> 27:07.082
So, let's go over this again, shall we?

27:07.158 --> 27:09.956
So there's no mistake.
So there's no gross error.

27:10.028 --> 27:13.395
So there's no lack
of communication amongst us.

27:13.465 --> 27:16.400
What I want, what we want...

27:16.468 --> 27:18.402
What do we want?

27:18.470 --> 27:22.770
Our time on this planet is over.
It belongs now to our youth.

27:22.841 --> 27:25.435
Not if we control their minds!

27:25.510 --> 27:29.071
We could start the world over again
and cure it of its diseases.

27:29.147 --> 27:31.809
We could begin anew.

27:38.590 --> 27:41.889
Forget what we could do!
It's what we should do!

27:41.960 --> 27:45.862
Am I doing the right thing?

27:46.431 --> 27:50.128
It's not about the right thing.
It's about the smart thing.

27:50.201 --> 27:50.963
Ah.

27:51.036 --> 27:53.834
We won't escape this place otherwise.

27:53.905 --> 27:57.864
I speak for all of us
when I say, "We want out!"

27:57.942 --> 27:59.239
Hmm.

27:59.310 --> 28:01.505
The end justifies the means.

28:02.514 --> 28:03.776
You have the children's attention.

28:03.848 --> 28:07.147
The question is,
what are you teaching them?

28:08.019 --> 28:09.884
Who are you people?

28:10.922 --> 28:12.583
We are you.

28:13.758 --> 28:15.658
Forgive me. Forgive me.

28:15.727 --> 28:19.060
I forget the extent of my
programming powers from time to time.

28:19.130 --> 28:24.762
For a moment, I actually
believed that you existed.

28:27.305 --> 28:28.704
Goodbye.

28:30.041 --> 28:31.372
Out, out, out.

28:31.443 --> 28:32.842
Out, out.

28:34.379 --> 28:37.678
This childish game will soon be over.

28:37.749 --> 28:41.515
And then the real game will begin.

28:44.823 --> 28:46.415
Hmm.

29:02.640 --> 29:04.835
Will you look at this?

29:07.479 --> 29:12.314
Hold on to your joysticks, boys.
I think we got him.

29:15.453 --> 29:16.750
You're the Guy.

29:16.821 --> 29:17.913
I'm the who?

29:17.989 --> 29:21.117
The Guy.
The guy from the poster.

29:21.192 --> 29:22.853
That guy.

29:25.530 --> 29:26.724
No. Wait a minute.

29:26.798 --> 29:30.734
I'm only looking for my sister.
She's somewhere on level four.

29:30.802 --> 29:33.999
Then I'm heading out through level five.

29:35.106 --> 29:37.040
So you can win the game?

29:37.108 --> 29:39.076
I guess that's one way of putting it.

29:39.144 --> 29:42.705
You see, according to the tech manual,

29:42.781 --> 29:45.545
if we find the Guy...

29:45.617 --> 29:47.278
the Guy...

29:47.352 --> 29:49.616
he'll lead us through the unwinnable level.

29:49.687 --> 29:52.087
Just 'cause he made it
out of Robocon in one piece

29:52.157 --> 29:53.522
doesn't mean he's the Guy.

29:53.591 --> 29:56.651
He's the first I've seen
to make it out with the power suit.

29:56.728 --> 30:00.459
Man, give me a break.
This wimp's a phony.

30:01.533 --> 30:03.763
There's only one way to find out.

30:04.903 --> 30:07.133
Mega Race.

30:07.205 --> 30:10.834
The fastest, most dangerous race
in the game world.

30:10.909 --> 30:12.137
- Come on.
- No. Wait.

30:12.210 --> 30:13.336
I already told you I'm not the Guy.

30:13.978 --> 30:15.275
- Go.
- OK.

30:18.416 --> 30:20.611
<i>The race will begin shortly.</i>

30:20.685 --> 30:22.983
<i>Claim your vehicle.</i>

30:31.896 --> 30:33.693
You got to be kidding.

30:33.765 --> 30:35.733
This race will tell us if you're the Guy.

30:35.800 --> 30:37.893
If you are, you can hang with us.

30:37.969 --> 30:41.700
But if you're a phony, Arnold will crush you.

30:41.773 --> 30:43.764
Aah!

30:44.809 --> 30:46.504
I'm not the Guy.

30:46.578 --> 30:49.046
How many times do I have to say it?

30:49.113 --> 30:51.445
<i>There are</i>
<i>no rules in this race.</i>

30:51.516 --> 30:54.974
<i>Except win at any cost.</i>

30:56.454 --> 30:57.853
All right!

31:25.350 --> 31:29.377
We'll try to help you out...
as much as we can.

31:29.854 --> 31:32.652
<i>The race will begin... now.</i>

31:32.724 --> 31:33.884
<i>One. Two. Three. Go!</i>

31:50.375 --> 31:51.933
Hmm?

32:00.251 --> 32:03.880
- Easy as pie.
- Juni, push the red button.

32:03.955 --> 32:06.753
The one that says "Do not push"?

32:06.824 --> 32:09.156
Yeah. Push it.
It's a turbo boost.

32:09.227 --> 32:11.388
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

32:21.940 --> 32:23.373
Aah!

32:25.276 --> 32:27.267
Hey, Rez, give me a hand!

32:27.345 --> 32:28.869
Hey, how about a foot?

32:28.947 --> 32:30.437
Aah! Aah!

32:31.849 --> 32:33.407
Whoa!

32:40.992 --> 32:42.983
Whoa!

32:45.063 --> 32:47.463
My turn, sucker.

32:47.532 --> 32:49.022
Aah!

32:52.637 --> 32:55.470
You're supposed to be
winning the race, Juni.

32:55.540 --> 32:57.269
Grandpa!

33:22.633 --> 33:24.999
What is this?

33:32.944 --> 33:34.377
Whoa!

33:56.100 --> 33:57.397
Ugh!

33:57.468 --> 33:58.526
Ugh!

33:59.203 --> 34:00.534
Nngh!

34:01.572 --> 34:03.005
Oh!

34:03.074 --> 34:04.507
The glove!

34:04.575 --> 34:06.475
Grab the glove.

34:06.544 --> 34:08.478
The glove!

34:09.447 --> 34:10.641
Ugh!

34:14.819 --> 34:16.184
Whoa!

34:16.420 --> 34:17.853
Whoa!

34:23.628 --> 34:25.118
Whoa!

34:54.125 --> 34:55.456
Ugh!

35:09.941 --> 35:11.704
Whoa.

35:17.448 --> 35:19.439
Uh-oh.

35:31.896 --> 35:33.090
Aah!

35:33.164 --> 35:35.962
Grab another bike, Juni!

35:43.141 --> 35:45.371
<i>Final stretch!</i>

36:15.173 --> 36:16.834
<i>Five... four...</i>

36:16.908 --> 36:19.342
<i>three... Two... one.</i>

36:19.877 --> 36:25.247
<i>Winner by a hubcap. Juni Cortez!</i>

36:39.463 --> 36:42.432
- I thought you were him.
- I knew it.

36:44.802 --> 36:46.770
I guess you are.

36:55.012 --> 36:58.539
So, I hear you're the Guy.

36:58.616 --> 37:01.517
I am definitely the Guy.

37:01.586 --> 37:02.746
Yeah!

37:04.755 --> 37:05.813
Yeah!

37:06.023 --> 37:07.320
Yeah!

37:20.805 --> 37:25.139
- So now what, Guy?
- I have to go talk to my grandfather.

37:25.209 --> 37:26.938
To who?

37:27.011 --> 37:29.639
I mean I must confer

37:29.714 --> 37:35.050
with the Wizard of Atari-Sega-Nendo.

37:36.053 --> 37:39.113
Yeah. OK, cool.

37:43.961 --> 37:47.761
Congratulations. You won the race.

37:47.832 --> 37:51.427
But now they think I'm some important guy
who's going to win for them.

37:51.502 --> 37:54.994
For our purposes, that's very good.

37:55.072 --> 37:58.599
They can lead us to level four
more quickly,

37:58.676 --> 38:00.143
so you can find your sister,

38:00.211 --> 38:03.147
so we can shut down the game
and make things right.

38:03.147 --> 38:07.777
And so that I can find...

38:07.852 --> 38:09.979
the Toymaker.

38:10.054 --> 38:13.615
We're not supposed to
get near the Toymaker.

38:14.558 --> 38:18.392
So say the rules of the OSS,

38:18.462 --> 38:20.623
which I'm not following.

38:20.698 --> 38:23.861
He might escape.
We can't risk that.

38:23.934 --> 38:26.562
Oh, no, Juni.

38:26.637 --> 38:30.232
I don't plan on letting him go anywhere.

38:30.308 --> 38:32.538
Guy!

38:32.610 --> 38:34.874
We'll talk about this later.

38:35.546 --> 38:37.309
OK. Here it is.

38:37.381 --> 38:40.407
I'm not supposed to lead you to level five.

38:40.484 --> 38:42.543
You're supposed to lead me there.

38:42.620 --> 38:44.611
So you mean we work together?

38:44.689 --> 38:49.126
The wizard said if we all work together,
we all win.

38:49.193 --> 38:51.593
With my strength.

38:51.662 --> 38:53.254
My brains.

38:53.331 --> 38:55.390
My cool.

38:55.466 --> 38:57.832
My intuition.

38:58.602 --> 39:02.834
OK. So you're the Guy.
We're all counting on you.

39:02.907 --> 39:06.365
But if you fail us or if you're
not who you say you are,

39:06.444 --> 39:10.642
this life counter will hit zero
faster than you can say "oops."

39:10.715 --> 39:12.012
Deal.

39:12.083 --> 39:14.517
First I got to find my sister.

39:14.585 --> 39:17.145
So level four, people.

39:17.221 --> 39:19.155
Move!

39:27.231 --> 39:28.255
Come on, Grandpa.

39:28.332 --> 39:31.199
He's doing good, huh?
Huh?

39:31.268 --> 39:34.169
Yeah, he's doing great,
and that's the problem.

39:34.238 --> 39:35.170
Why?

39:35.239 --> 39:37.605
They've awoken the Programmerz.

39:37.675 --> 39:38.664
What?

39:39.110 --> 39:42.102
- Pull him out of there now.
- Too late.

39:45.916 --> 39:48.510
All right. This is cool.

39:48.586 --> 39:50.679
We'll get there in no time.

39:51.489 --> 39:53.650
What is this?

39:57.561 --> 39:59.586
Wait a minute.

40:01.465 --> 40:02.932
The Programmerz.

40:03.734 --> 40:07.363
Who are these Programmerz?

40:07.438 --> 40:09.565
The brainiacs who wrote
the book for the game.

40:09.640 --> 40:14.236
So, they work for the Toymaker, huh?

40:14.311 --> 40:16.779
Programmerz are the reason
you found us on level one.

40:16.847 --> 40:19.281
They caught Francis cheating
during the Mega Race.

40:19.350 --> 40:22.080
They'll bounce us back
to level one again if they catch us.

40:22.153 --> 40:24.986
Level one? I don't have time for that.

40:26.857 --> 40:28.051
Spread out.

40:28.125 --> 40:30.252
Don't split up! It never works!

40:30.327 --> 40:32.454
If we just stick together...

40:33.531 --> 40:38.025
All right, Grandpa.
I guess it's just you and me.

40:38.102 --> 40:39.763
Hello?

40:40.938 --> 40:43.133
Grandpa?

40:51.248 --> 40:52.772
- Psst!
- Aah!

40:52.850 --> 40:55.978
Can you at least try and act
like you're the Guy?

40:56.053 --> 40:58.044
You know my secret?

40:58.122 --> 41:01.455
I've seen the real Guy, and you're not him.

41:02.293 --> 41:05.126
Why are Programmerz chasing us?

41:05.196 --> 41:06.891
Someone's got a game cheat.

41:06.964 --> 41:08.056
What's this?

41:08.132 --> 41:09.656
A map to the game.

41:09.733 --> 41:11.325
This is illegal.

41:11.402 --> 41:14.030
You want to find your sister or not?

41:15.072 --> 41:17.063
Give me the map.

41:18.676 --> 41:20.234
- OK.
- Wow.

41:20.311 --> 41:21.710
We're in Machine City.

41:21.779 --> 41:24.714
If we cut across here,
we'll be able to reach level four.

41:24.782 --> 41:26.306
Where Carmen is.

41:26.383 --> 41:27.407
Right.

41:27.485 --> 41:30.386
Then, if we cut through Lava Mountain,

41:30.454 --> 41:32.922
we'll be right at the door
of the unwinnable level.

41:32.990 --> 41:36.926
Shortcuts. This is good.
This is very good.

41:36.994 --> 41:39.519
Game cheats.

41:40.498 --> 41:42.989
That's against the rules.

41:44.134 --> 41:49.504
We're gonna have to bounce you
back to level one.

41:49.540 --> 41:52.407
- Aah!
- You can't scare us. He's the Guy.

41:52.476 --> 41:54.171
Grandpa!

41:54.245 --> 41:59.649
Listen to that, Edog.
The Guy is calling his grandpa.

42:00.251 --> 42:03.277
I'm so scared.
Come and get me, Gramps.

42:03.354 --> 42:06.016
What's he gonna do, drool on us?

42:07.124 --> 42:09.922
Why are you picking on my grandson?

42:10.995 --> 42:12.019
Why?

42:13.297 --> 42:16.698
They got Logos and Edog, the leaders.

42:16.767 --> 42:19.031
You are Programmerz?

42:19.103 --> 42:22.163
Let's see what you really look like, huh?

42:26.410 --> 42:28.241
Very unimpressive.

42:28.812 --> 42:30.712
Computer nerds.

42:30.781 --> 42:34.273
Now tell me, where is the Toymaker?

42:34.351 --> 42:38.048
Grandpa... uh, Wizard, put them down!

42:52.236 --> 42:53.897
He's good.

42:53.971 --> 42:56.997
The boy warrior is very, very good.

42:57.074 --> 42:58.632
But he's got to keep going.

42:58.709 --> 43:00.574
We run the risk of discouraging him

43:00.644 --> 43:03.514
if the next levels are too challenging.

43:03.514 --> 43:05.345
But only by seeking challenges

43:05.416 --> 43:08.647
can we hope to find the best in ourselves.

43:08.719 --> 43:09.845
Can we help him?

43:09.920 --> 43:12.115
No! It's against the rules of the game!

43:12.189 --> 43:14.384
This isn't a game.

43:15.092 --> 43:17.492
It's life!

43:19.196 --> 43:21.687
I don't mind talking to myself.

43:22.232 --> 43:25.360
But when you guys start to
cut me out of the conversation,

43:25.436 --> 43:28.803
that's when it gets a little strange.

43:30.174 --> 43:33.143
That's it.
More life is what we need.

43:33.210 --> 43:38.079
We'll grant the boy a gift.
The gift of life.

43:44.951 --> 43:46.213
Don't worry, Guy.

43:46.286 --> 43:48.015
From here on out, I'll protect you.

43:49.790 --> 43:51.314
Are you all right, Guy?

43:51.391 --> 43:54.485
Hey. He found a life pack.

43:54.561 --> 43:55.653
A what?

43:55.729 --> 43:56.991
That's rare.

43:57.064 --> 43:59.362
I've never seen one up close before.

43:59.433 --> 44:00.866
What do I do?

44:00.934 --> 44:04.597
Crush it in your hands.
You'll gain life.

44:06.206 --> 44:07.537
How much?

44:07.607 --> 44:09.575
All depends.

44:13.113 --> 44:15.206
I got extra life, Demetra.

44:15.282 --> 44:18.513
Congratulations.
You'll need it the most.

44:19.386 --> 44:21.513
I want you to take it.

44:22.289 --> 44:24.780
Juni, I can't.

44:33.066 --> 44:34.624
Does he know what that's worth?

44:34.701 --> 44:36.635
Of course he does.

44:38.438 --> 44:40.998
I owed you from the Robot Arena.

44:41.074 --> 44:45.841
Also, I don't want anything
to happen to you.

44:45.912 --> 44:47.436
Thank you.

44:51.885 --> 44:56.322
<i>You have now entered level three.</i>

45:03.263 --> 45:06.858
I wish my family
could see this amazing place.

45:06.933 --> 45:09.766
What are you doing in the game, Arnold?

45:20.881 --> 45:23.611
Well, actually, I got in
on a beta tester's visa.

45:23.683 --> 45:26.618
I'm here for the great prize
behind level five.

45:26.686 --> 45:28.745
It'll save my family from poverty.

45:28.822 --> 45:30.790
But what waits for us in level five?

45:30.857 --> 45:33.849
I mean, is it all true?
Untold riches?

45:34.428 --> 45:36.828
Arnold, you should know

45:36.897 --> 45:39.195
that when we reach the end of the game...

45:39.266 --> 45:41.734
No. Don't tell me.

45:42.702 --> 45:45.136
I want it to be a surprise.

45:45.205 --> 45:46.672
- I'm sure it will be.

45:46.740 --> 45:49.106
<i>Attention. Gamers!</i>

45:49.176 --> 45:51.144
<i>Stand on the red line.</i>

45:52.813 --> 45:55.805
<i>Choose your best player.</i>

45:56.583 --> 45:59.381
The Guy.
The Guy's the best.

46:00.153 --> 46:03.418
<i>Choose your strongest player.</i>

46:03.490 --> 46:05.082
That'd be Arnold.

46:18.472 --> 46:21.100
<i>Survival of the fittest.</i>

46:21.174 --> 46:23.642
<i>Face your opponent.</i>

46:25.879 --> 46:28.814
Wait a minute.
I'm not fighting Arnold.

46:28.882 --> 46:30.679
I don't want to crush Juni.

46:30.750 --> 46:33.776
<i>The winner shall proceed</i>
<i>with the others to level four.</i>

46:33.854 --> 46:36.288
<i>The loser shall be given</i>
<i>an immediate game over</i>

46:36.356 --> 46:40.759
<i>and will be evacuated</i>
<i>permanently from the game.</i>

46:40.827 --> 46:43.489
Arnold, I have to save my sister.

46:43.563 --> 46:45.656
I'm sorry, Juni.

46:45.732 --> 46:48.462
But I have my own family to think about.

46:49.469 --> 46:51.596
I can't beat you, Arnold.

46:55.876 --> 46:57.173
I know.

46:57.777 --> 47:00.177
<i>Fight!</i>

47:14.961 --> 47:16.622
Aah!

47:42.389 --> 47:44.619
Not that I'm rooting for anyone in particular,

47:44.691 --> 47:47.285
but that was a really cool move.

47:50.797 --> 47:52.162
Aah!

48:07.914 --> 48:09.643
Nice knowing you, Juni.

48:09.716 --> 48:11.081
Arnold, please!

48:12.052 --> 48:14.486
- Unh!

48:18.558 --> 48:20.116
What's going on?

48:20.193 --> 48:21.956
<i>You've been tagged.</i>

48:22.028 --> 48:23.893
What do you mean, I've been tagged?

48:23.964 --> 48:27.024
<i>Someone has switched places with you.</i>

48:29.736 --> 48:30.828
Not me, Guy.

48:33.173 --> 48:34.834
Demetra, what are you doing?

48:34.908 --> 48:38.002
You have to find your sister, Juni.

48:39.012 --> 48:40.377
Don't! Don't do it!

48:43.383 --> 48:44.714
Demetra, no!

48:44.784 --> 48:46.046
<i>Fight!</i>

48:48.922 --> 48:51.015
- No!
- Aah!

48:54.361 --> 48:59.025
<i>Demetra. Game over!</i>

49:03.570 --> 49:08.269
I never even got her e-mail address.

49:11.711 --> 49:15.841
Don't fall in love with a game, Juni.

49:19.986 --> 49:22.580
Let's get out of here.

49:22.656 --> 49:24.521
Sorry, Juni.

49:25.759 --> 49:27.556
My family.

49:33.633 --> 49:38.468
You are causing so much pain.

49:39.572 --> 49:42.666
And only I can stop you.

49:42.742 --> 49:46.234
For I know why you do these things...

49:46.946 --> 49:49.278
Toymaker.

49:50.250 --> 49:52.241
Bring it on.

49:53.253 --> 49:57.849
Find me, and the world
will truly pay the price.

49:58.925 --> 50:03.589
Here in my cyberprison
I was forced to create.

50:05.031 --> 50:08.558
Now I will destroy.

50:10.270 --> 50:13.433
Release the girl.
Put her back in the game.

50:14.774 --> 50:15.763
But, sir...

50:15.842 --> 50:17.969
Oh, you have a better solution, don't you?

50:18.044 --> 50:20.638
Of course you do. You all do.

50:20.714 --> 50:22.705
So tell me.
What is the real answer?

50:22.782 --> 50:25.216
- I'm so curious.
- Revenge.

50:25.285 --> 50:27.219
- Healing.
- Destruction!

50:27.287 --> 50:28.720
- Love.
- Hate.

50:28.788 --> 50:29.914
Uh-huh.

50:29.989 --> 50:32.480
Well, once again, you're all correct.

50:32.559 --> 50:36.120
And once again, you're all incorrect.

50:42.836 --> 50:45.236
On with the game.

50:49.109 --> 50:53.409
<i>You are now entering level four.</i>

50:53.480 --> 50:56.313
Level four? Wait a minute.

50:56.382 --> 50:59.010
Carmen's on this level.

51:07.994 --> 51:09.256
I'll use telepathy.

51:09.329 --> 51:11.661
We might be close enough that it'll work.

51:11.731 --> 51:13.631
<i>Carmen. Can you hear me?</i>

51:13.700 --> 51:15.565
What?

51:15.635 --> 51:17.603
<i>This game plays tricks.</i>

51:17.670 --> 51:20.468
<i>Tell me something</i>
<i>only Carmen would say.</i>

51:20.540 --> 51:22.974
My feet stink.

51:23.977 --> 51:25.444
You sound close.

51:25.512 --> 51:27.503
I am.

51:42.228 --> 51:45.254
I see you brought Grandpa into the game.

51:45.331 --> 51:47.595
I thought it was a good idea at the time.

51:47.667 --> 51:49.567
Juni!

51:49.636 --> 51:53.037
The Toymaker's the guy
who put Grandpa in the wheelchair

51:53.106 --> 51:55.040
30 years ago.

51:55.108 --> 51:56.769
Exactly.

51:56.843 --> 52:00.643
If Grandpa tries to take revenge,
the Toymaker will break free.

52:00.713 --> 52:02.510
He's that powerful.

52:03.516 --> 52:07.247
Then we have to convince Grandpa
that revenge is not the way to solve it.

52:07.320 --> 52:09.311
OK, Guy. We found your pal.

52:09.389 --> 52:12.222
Now, where are we going, exactly?
Where's level five?

52:12.292 --> 52:14.726
First of all, you don't
ask the questions around here.

52:14.794 --> 52:16.785
I do. Second of all...

52:16.863 --> 52:19.832
- We're going to Lava Mountain.
- We are?

52:19.899 --> 52:23.391
Beyond that is the passage to level five.

52:23.469 --> 52:24.561
I don't think so.

52:24.637 --> 52:26.935
Oh, so suddenly you're the game expert.

52:27.006 --> 52:29.201
We're following the Guy.

52:31.678 --> 52:34.704
You know, Juni, we don't need
these guys following us.

52:34.781 --> 52:36.043
Not where we're going.

52:36.115 --> 52:38.208
I promised them they could tag along.

52:38.284 --> 52:42.186
Look, this is how I know where to go.
Trust me.

52:45.124 --> 52:47.058
Lava Mountain.

52:47.126 --> 52:50.357
Why is it that every video game
has lava in it?

52:50.430 --> 52:52.125
Technically, that's not true.

52:52.198 --> 52:54.189
There's no lava in Halo.

52:54.267 --> 52:56.360
And in Metroid, it's molten magma.

52:56.436 --> 52:59.098
Can't touch the lava, or it's game over.

52:59.172 --> 53:00.662
But I have six lives left.

53:00.740 --> 53:03.334
Doesn't matter.
You fall in, you lose.

53:03.409 --> 53:05.900
The game's getting tougher, guys.

53:05.979 --> 53:07.412
This is impossible.

53:07.480 --> 53:10.449
What do you think, Grandpa?

53:10.516 --> 53:11.915
Difficult.

53:11.985 --> 53:15.546
Let's go another way.
Follow me, boys.

53:16.823 --> 53:19.348
This doesn't make any sense.

53:19.459 --> 53:21.450
I give them a map.

53:21.527 --> 53:23.518
I give them the girl.

53:23.596 --> 53:25.723
What more do they want?

53:25.798 --> 53:27.789
Can't I just lead them to the door?

53:27.867 --> 53:30.529
Impossible, sir.
The way the game's A.I. Works is...

53:30.603 --> 53:31.797
I know. I know.

53:31.871 --> 53:33.702
Can I just talk to myself at least?

53:33.773 --> 53:36.537
You are talking to yourself.
I am you.

53:36.609 --> 53:40.443
Well, then, you, me, shut up.

53:40.513 --> 53:41.946
So be it.

53:42.015 --> 53:43.243
Am I insane?

53:43.316 --> 53:44.977
Completely.

53:49.689 --> 53:52.590
They're going the wrong way.

53:52.659 --> 53:55.651
I have to drive them to level five.

53:59.632 --> 54:03.398
Send in the Tinker Toys.

54:05.271 --> 54:08.035
Finding another path.
Now, this is good thinking.

54:08.107 --> 54:10.439
She's good.
We should listen to her more often.

54:10.510 --> 54:14.105
- Stay off my side.
- OK.

54:20.186 --> 54:21.983
What is this?

54:32.832 --> 54:35.232
Tinker Toys!

54:38.371 --> 54:42.273
Wait! What's worse, lava or Tinker Toys?

54:42.342 --> 54:45.038
Definitely Tinker Toys.

54:45.111 --> 54:47.102
Carmen, what do we do?

55:22.815 --> 55:25.215
Whoa!

55:26.652 --> 55:27.812
Ugh!

55:31.024 --> 55:32.321
Uh-oh!

55:34.027 --> 55:35.255
Whoo-hoo!

55:35.328 --> 55:38.491
Rip that wave, Juni.

55:39.732 --> 55:41.666
What are they doing?

55:41.734 --> 55:43.827
They're straying from the path.

55:43.903 --> 55:46.463
The Toymaker must be
pushing them towards his lair.

55:46.539 --> 55:49.565
But why?
What could he gain from...

55:50.276 --> 55:53.541
Check if there's a connection between
the grandfather and the Toymaker.

55:53.613 --> 55:55.877
Hurry, people!

55:55.948 --> 55:58.439
It's coming on-screen.

55:58.518 --> 56:00.713
Comrades turned enemies.

56:01.854 --> 56:05.085
Grandpa's gonna break the Toymaker
out of the game.

56:05.158 --> 56:06.625
Stop them.

56:06.692 --> 56:09.354
Stir the lava. Bigger waves.

56:09.429 --> 56:11.056
Lava monsters. Anything.

56:11.130 --> 56:12.927
We have to create obstacles for them.

56:12.999 --> 56:14.057
Come on!

56:14.133 --> 56:15.896
We have to drown them.

56:16.903 --> 56:20.304
They'll get a game over
and be evacuated from the game.

56:20.373 --> 56:23.467
We can't risk letting the Toymaker out.

56:25.511 --> 56:27.069
Do it.

56:34.620 --> 56:36.588
This is new.

56:40.626 --> 56:42.093
Juni!

56:46.232 --> 56:47.597
Carmen!

56:50.670 --> 56:52.399
Francis!

56:53.573 --> 56:55.302
Arnold!

56:58.878 --> 57:00.869
Grandpa!

57:01.814 --> 57:03.714
Me.

57:04.784 --> 57:05.944
Aah!

57:07.053 --> 57:08.350
Where are they?

57:08.421 --> 57:09.547
They fell in.

57:09.622 --> 57:13.524
I know, but they should have
gotten a game over.

57:13.593 --> 57:15.424
They should be back here, actually.

57:15.495 --> 57:17.019
Hmm.

57:22.468 --> 57:24.026
<i>Huh?</i>

57:25.271 --> 57:29.139
<i>The lava. It's cold.</i>

57:30.309 --> 57:35.008
<i>This way. Juni. This way.</i>
<i>We found a door to the next level.</i>

57:35.882 --> 57:37.349
<i>Come on.</i>

57:39.552 --> 57:41.884
I thought I was a goner.

57:43.156 --> 57:46.148
I saw all my points
flashing away before my eyes.

57:46.225 --> 57:49.319
All I could hear was
my father saying, "You blew it, Arnold."

57:49.395 --> 57:52.057
"No untold riches for you."

57:53.065 --> 57:54.794
Uhh!

57:57.470 --> 57:58.801
Where's Grandpa?

57:58.871 --> 58:00.896
I don't know. But he was here.

58:00.973 --> 58:03.373
Isn't this a piece of his armor?

58:07.280 --> 58:10.579
Carmen, it's a passage.
Help me open it.

58:10.650 --> 58:11.981
Red flag, Rez.

58:12.051 --> 58:15.612
We have to talk about the Guy.
Highly sensitive.

58:15.688 --> 58:17.212
What about him?

58:17.290 --> 58:19.588
I've been rereading my tech manual.

58:19.659 --> 58:22.219
It speaks of a deceiver within the game,

58:22.295 --> 58:25.264
who will mislead you down a path
where no one will survive.

58:25.331 --> 58:27.697
I think Juni's the deceiver.

58:28.601 --> 58:30.865
What do you suggest?

58:30.937 --> 58:34.964
We'll have to get rid of him
or risk losing the game.

58:36.375 --> 58:38.434
What about his sister?

58:38.511 --> 58:40.172
Her too.

58:44.650 --> 58:47.244
- How much time do we have left?
- Five minutes.

58:47.320 --> 58:48.878
What happens in five minutes?

58:48.955 --> 58:51.617
This place gets flooded
with players from around the world.

58:51.691 --> 58:53.886
Oh, great. Competition.

58:53.960 --> 58:55.894
The Toymaker will take over their minds.

58:55.962 --> 58:57.623
That's why we have to
shut down the game.

58:57.697 --> 59:00.791
- Sh, Carmen!
- What is she talking about?

59:01.934 --> 59:03.902
You didn't tell them yet, did you?

59:03.970 --> 59:05.460
I was getting around to it.

59:05.538 --> 59:07.597
Deceivers.

59:07.673 --> 59:09.800
What about the other side of level five?

59:09.875 --> 59:13.174
There is no other side.
You'll be imprisoned in the game.

59:13.246 --> 59:14.338
Game over.

59:14.413 --> 59:16.540
We're not letting you shut down this game.

59:16.616 --> 59:19.813
You're gonna see how fast
that counter can count backwards.

59:19.885 --> 59:23.321
You have to go through me first, game boy.

59:23.389 --> 59:26.153
Now, listen to me.
I'm the Guy.

59:26.225 --> 59:27.988
Stop saying you're the Guy.

59:28.060 --> 59:30.324
We all know that you're not the Guy.

59:30.396 --> 59:32.227
<i>He's not the Guy.</i>

59:37.136 --> 59:38.797
I am.

59:41.874 --> 59:43.364
And you are?

59:43.976 --> 59:46.410
I'm the Guy.

59:46.479 --> 59:48.174
The real Guy.

59:48.247 --> 59:49.373
And I say we go in,

59:49.448 --> 59:52.212
beat this unwinnable level,
and get to the other side,

59:52.285 --> 59:56.051
where untold riches
and a bounty fit for 10 kings awaits us.

59:56.122 --> 59:57.282
I knew it.

59:57.356 --> 59:59.722
Now, he's definitely the Guy.

01:00:00.359 --> 01:00:03.055
But it's unwinnable.

01:00:08.200 --> 01:00:10.191
Nothing is unwinnable

01:00:10.269 --> 01:00:12.737
if we join together and battle as one.

01:00:12.805 --> 01:00:14.830
We play on each other's strengths

01:00:14.907 --> 01:00:17.034
and help cover each other's weaknesses.

01:00:17.109 --> 01:00:18.508
We can accomplish anything.

01:00:18.577 --> 01:00:21.307
And we will accomplish everything.

01:00:21.380 --> 01:00:26.317
But first let's go whip this unwinnable level

01:00:26.385 --> 01:00:27.852
and show it who's boss.

01:00:27.920 --> 01:00:28.909
Are you with me?

01:00:28.988 --> 01:00:30.455
Yeah!

01:00:31.457 --> 01:00:33.322
Stand aside.

01:00:47.740 --> 01:00:49.264
Cake.

01:00:50.343 --> 01:00:53.141
Aah! Aah!

01:01:00.453 --> 01:01:01.681
Oh!

01:01:01.754 --> 01:01:03.244
Oh, my.

01:01:06.559 --> 01:01:07.924
Oops.

01:01:10.262 --> 01:01:11.752
Guy!

01:01:12.865 --> 01:01:15.060
OK. You're the Guy again.

01:01:15.134 --> 01:01:16.795
Get us through this, Juni.

01:01:16.869 --> 01:01:18.359
But I...

01:01:28.481 --> 01:01:30.142
Demetra!

01:01:30.850 --> 01:01:32.010
Juni, quickly!

01:01:32.084 --> 01:01:33.984
I found the switch to shut down the game.

01:01:34.053 --> 01:01:35.577
I also found the exit portal.

01:01:35.654 --> 01:01:37.554
We can all get out of here right now.

01:01:37.623 --> 01:01:39.784
How did you survive?

01:01:39.859 --> 01:01:42.384
There was a glitch in the game.
I don't know.

01:01:42.461 --> 01:01:44.019
Juni, who is this?

01:01:44.096 --> 01:01:46.758
This is Demetra, my girlf...

01:01:46.832 --> 01:01:49.198
My friend.
No, she's my...

01:01:49.268 --> 01:01:52.135
I'm his girlfriend.
Who are you?

01:01:52.204 --> 01:01:54.195
I'm his sister.

01:01:54.273 --> 01:01:57.401
She gave me the map.
The map that got us here.

01:01:57.476 --> 01:01:59.444
Juni, she's not real.

01:02:00.312 --> 01:02:01.904
What are you talking about?

01:02:01.981 --> 01:02:03.915
I've been helping Juni win the game.

01:02:03.983 --> 01:02:05.314
What have you been doing?

01:02:05.384 --> 01:02:07.045
Playing prisoner. That's what.

01:02:07.119 --> 01:02:10.486
She set you up, Juni.
She set us all up.

01:02:10.556 --> 01:02:12.956
I... Juni, she's lying.

01:02:13.025 --> 01:02:14.617
She's been the Toymaker's prisoner.

01:02:14.693 --> 01:02:17.491
She could be brainwashed, for all we know.

01:02:17.563 --> 01:02:20.293
Do you want to win this game or not?

01:02:25.304 --> 01:02:28.000
She's the reason this level's unwinnable.

01:02:28.073 --> 01:02:29.973
She's the deceiver.

01:02:31.043 --> 01:02:32.169
Why?

01:02:32.244 --> 01:02:33.677
I'm sorry, Juni.

01:02:33.746 --> 01:02:37.079
But it's in my programming.

01:02:44.523 --> 01:02:46.081
<i>Congratulations!</i>

01:02:46.158 --> 01:02:50.185
<i>You've made it to the end</i>
<i>of the game! You won!</i>

01:02:50.262 --> 01:02:52.992
<i>Untold riches for all of you!</i>

01:02:53.065 --> 01:02:57.866
<i>And your prize</i>
<i>is you get to stay... here.</i>

01:02:58.504 --> 01:03:01.098
<i>Welcome to the game.</i>

01:03:06.679 --> 01:03:08.442
<i>Juni, this way.</i>

01:03:08.514 --> 01:03:09.708
This is the way out.

01:03:09.782 --> 01:03:11.807
All of you, quickly!

01:03:15.788 --> 01:03:17.881
Wait!
We have to shut down the game.

01:03:17.957 --> 01:03:20.084
I already did.
The switch is right there.

01:03:20.159 --> 01:03:21.387
- Are you sure?
- Yes, yes.

01:03:21.460 --> 01:03:24.293
Go. Quickly, quickly.

01:03:32.371 --> 01:03:34.066
Run, Grandpa!

01:03:34.139 --> 01:03:36.369
Go. I'll hold it open.

01:03:36.442 --> 01:03:37.466
Go now!

01:03:38.511 --> 01:03:40.001
Demetra.

01:03:40.079 --> 01:03:43.105
I can't hold it open forever, Juni.

01:03:49.455 --> 01:03:50.786
We made it.

01:03:51.790 --> 01:03:55.851
Here's our e-mail addresses.
Just in case.

01:03:55.928 --> 01:03:57.657
Terrific.

01:03:58.631 --> 01:04:00.292
You're awesome, Grandpa.

01:04:00.366 --> 01:04:03.335
The way you took on those Tinker Toys.

01:04:04.470 --> 01:04:06.404
You're the coolest.

01:04:09.542 --> 01:04:12.102
Thanks for everything, Guy.

01:04:12.177 --> 01:04:15.169
It was real. Sort of.

01:04:16.215 --> 01:04:18.683
- Thanks a lot, Guy.

01:04:30.162 --> 01:04:32.426
What's wrong?

01:04:32.498 --> 01:04:34.796
You don't want to leave, do you?

01:04:34.867 --> 01:04:36.698
How can I go back, Juni?

01:04:37.303 --> 01:04:42.240
In here, I can walk.
I can run.

01:04:42.308 --> 01:04:46.540
And you look at me
like I'm some kind of superhero.

01:04:46.612 --> 01:04:48.079
You are.

01:04:48.147 --> 01:04:51.378
Out there in the real world, to me.

01:04:51.450 --> 01:04:52.747
You are.

01:04:52.818 --> 01:04:54.718
All right, Juni.

01:04:54.787 --> 01:04:57.221
I shall go back if...

01:04:57.289 --> 01:05:01.988
if you promise me that even
though I'll be in a wheelchair,

01:05:03.228 --> 01:05:07.494
that you will look at me
no differently than you are now.

01:05:07.566 --> 01:05:14.495
Because on the inside, Juni,
on the inside, I feel like this.

01:05:16.208 --> 01:05:18.642
I promise, Grandpa.

01:05:20.813 --> 01:05:23.008
Time to go.

01:05:33.425 --> 01:05:36.087
Coming through.
Coming through, please.

01:05:36.161 --> 01:05:38.994
Those video games
are killers on the eyes, huh, kid?

01:05:39.064 --> 01:05:41.032
Agent Cortez, we'll take it from here.

01:05:41.100 --> 01:05:43.330
My grandson will handle this.

01:05:43.402 --> 01:05:46.769
Don't touch.
This is Corinthian leather.

01:05:52.678 --> 01:05:53.542
OK.

01:05:53.612 --> 01:05:57.207
So tell me again
how you shut off the game.

01:05:57.282 --> 01:05:59.307
I don't know if we shut it down, exactly.

01:05:59.385 --> 01:06:01.148
We hit a switch, and it seemed to work.

01:06:01.220 --> 01:06:03.211
Oh, it worked.
The game's down.

01:06:03.288 --> 01:06:06.223
We just need to make sure
we did this correctly.

01:06:06.291 --> 01:06:09.260
Actually, Grandpa hit the switch.

01:06:09.328 --> 01:06:12.263
Cortez, are these the boys
that were in the game with you?

01:06:12.331 --> 01:06:14.492
We tracked them
through their e-mail addresses.

01:06:14.566 --> 01:06:18.058
Yeah, that's them.
They wouldn't know anything about...

01:06:18.137 --> 01:06:19.468
Hey, wait a second.

01:06:19.538 --> 01:06:21.904
What happened to Francis the Brain,

01:06:21.974 --> 01:06:23.999
Arnold the Strong, and Mr. Cool?

01:06:24.076 --> 01:06:27.307
Well, in the real world, I'm not that smart.

01:06:27.379 --> 01:06:29.370
I'm not strong.

01:06:29.448 --> 01:06:30.972
I'm not cool.

01:06:32.184 --> 01:06:33.515
Reality check.

01:06:33.585 --> 01:06:35.917
So who are you out here in the real world?

01:06:35.988 --> 01:06:38.957
Special Agent Cortez, we need you.

01:06:39.558 --> 01:06:40.889
Whoa.

01:06:41.960 --> 01:06:44.724
I'm just Juni Cortez.

01:06:44.797 --> 01:06:48.961
Let's have it, Grandpa.
What switch did you hit exactly?

01:06:49.034 --> 01:06:51.059
There were two switches side by side.

01:06:51.136 --> 01:06:52.933
One switch shuts down the game.

01:06:53.005 --> 01:06:54.996
But the other releases the Toymaker.

01:06:55.074 --> 01:06:57.167
Who was the idiot who designed that?

01:06:59.912 --> 01:07:02.437
Did you free the Toymaker by accident?

01:07:02.514 --> 01:07:05.574
Oh, I freed the Toymaker.
But it was no accident.

01:07:05.651 --> 01:07:07.983
Do you want to stop the game?

01:07:08.053 --> 01:07:11.352
Then you must defeat the Toymaker.
It's the only way.

01:07:11.423 --> 01:07:12.754
You crazy old man!

01:07:12.825 --> 01:07:14.793
Do you know what you've done?

01:07:15.794 --> 01:07:17.989
Grandpa, revenge doesn't solve anything.

01:07:18.864 --> 01:07:21.560
Will you trust me?
You of all people?

01:07:22.267 --> 01:07:23.632
A message from the president.

01:07:23.702 --> 01:07:25.499
Oh, what does he want?

01:07:26.038 --> 01:07:30.498
<i>I'm coming back to settle the score.</i>

01:07:30.576 --> 01:07:32.806
<i>For imprisoning me.</i>

01:07:32.878 --> 01:07:34.607
<i>For using me.</i>

01:07:34.680 --> 01:07:36.204
Devlin set us up?

01:07:36.281 --> 01:07:37.805
It's not Devlin.

01:07:38.450 --> 01:07:42.477
<i>All I wanted to do was right the wrongs.</i>

01:07:42.554 --> 01:07:44.249
<i>Start over a new world.</i>

01:07:44.323 --> 01:07:46.450
<i>A new chance.</i>

01:07:46.525 --> 01:07:50.427
<i>Where everyone would get</i>
<i>a second chance!</i>

01:07:51.396 --> 01:07:53.091
<i>But no.</i>

01:07:54.533 --> 01:07:59.095
<i>So now I'm taking this</i>
<i>to the next level!</i>

01:08:01.640 --> 01:08:03.574
Seismic activity off the map!

01:08:03.642 --> 01:08:05.200
- Aah!
- Aah!

01:08:05.277 --> 01:08:06.301
Earthquake!

01:08:06.378 --> 01:08:07.777
Tornado!

01:08:07.846 --> 01:08:08.835
Hurricane!

01:08:09.414 --> 01:08:11.382
Carmen, let's go!

01:08:11.450 --> 01:08:13.315
Everybody, relax!

01:08:31.336 --> 01:08:33.031
Quick! Put your glasses on.

01:08:33.104 --> 01:08:36.198
It's the only way you can see
what's really happening.

01:08:36.274 --> 01:08:39.108
The game has entered the real world.

01:08:42.346 --> 01:08:45.282
There's only one thing to do
in a situation like this.

01:08:45.317 --> 01:08:46.249
What?

01:08:46.752 --> 01:08:49.983
Call in the family.
Calling all Cortezes.

01:08:51.323 --> 01:08:55.225
This is it. This is it.

01:08:55.294 --> 01:08:56.783
This is it.

01:08:56.862 --> 01:08:59.421
The moment we've been waiting for.

01:08:59.497 --> 01:09:00.965
Yes.

01:09:01.033 --> 01:09:03.593
Nobody move. Nobody move!

01:09:03.669 --> 01:09:06.365
Nobody touch the brain.
The fifth brain.

01:09:09.441 --> 01:09:11.466
This is a historic moment.

01:09:11.542 --> 01:09:14.011
Probably the...

01:09:17.381 --> 01:09:20.613
Probably the most important...

01:09:20.685 --> 01:09:21.812
No.

01:09:22.821 --> 01:09:26.381
This is the most important
moment of my life.

01:09:27.792 --> 01:09:30.023
No one can disturb me now.

01:09:30.095 --> 01:09:33.462
I must activate the brain.

01:09:35.100 --> 01:09:36.089
Now.

01:09:36.167 --> 01:09:37.430
- Mr. Cortez?
- Eh?

01:09:37.502 --> 01:09:41.268
Your children called.
Some sort of emergency.

01:09:53.518 --> 01:09:55.577
Well, I'm their uncle.

01:10:02.561 --> 01:10:04.791
Dad, you need these to see.

01:10:04.863 --> 01:10:06.091
Glasses, quick!

01:10:16.141 --> 01:10:17.972
Incoming.

01:10:36.895 --> 01:10:38.487
This won't be easy.

01:10:43.969 --> 01:10:46.028
Let's kick some metal.

01:10:55.147 --> 01:10:57.547
What about all the other ones?

01:11:01.353 --> 01:11:03.878
We need more help.
Our family isn't big enough.

01:11:03.956 --> 01:11:07.187
Remember one thing.
Everyone's your family.

01:11:09.962 --> 01:11:13.864
Calling... everyone.

01:11:17.402 --> 01:11:19.495
We're here to save the day.

01:11:20.105 --> 01:11:21.970
Floop and Minion!

01:11:27.245 --> 01:11:29.076
Robot children!

01:11:30.082 --> 01:11:32.209
Take 'em down!

01:11:34.152 --> 01:11:36.586
Dinky Winks!

01:11:40.158 --> 01:11:43.252
Somebody ring the Dinkster?

01:11:46.999 --> 01:11:48.398
Whoa!

01:11:49.301 --> 01:11:53.203
You're gonna make a nice addition
to my theme park.

01:11:54.773 --> 01:11:58.334
Game over for you, pal.
Game over!

01:12:04.383 --> 01:12:06.283
Somebody call in a loon?

01:12:07.152 --> 01:12:09.712
Sorry, Romero,
this is the only pair we had left.

01:12:09.788 --> 01:12:11.915
They're a little broken.

01:12:11.990 --> 01:12:14.049
They're perfect.

01:12:14.926 --> 01:12:17.121
Charge, Sporky!

01:12:18.163 --> 01:12:19.630
Brand him, Daddy.

01:12:20.165 --> 01:12:22.258
Thanks, Little Dink.

01:12:29.608 --> 01:12:31.269
- Unh!
- Unh!

01:12:37.549 --> 01:12:38.607
Gary Giggles?

01:12:39.751 --> 01:12:41.343
- Yeah?
- <i>Carmen Cortez.</i>

01:12:41.420 --> 01:12:42.819
<i>I need your help right away.</i>

01:12:42.888 --> 01:12:44.549
I'm there.

01:12:47.659 --> 01:12:48.819
I'm here.

01:12:48.894 --> 01:12:50.555
Give me a hand.

01:12:51.329 --> 01:12:52.318
Whoa.

01:12:56.201 --> 01:12:58.192
- Unh!
- Thanks.

01:13:02.340 --> 01:13:04.001
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:13:05.544 --> 01:13:06.511
Thank you, Gerti.

01:13:07.746 --> 01:13:10.271
There's still one more.

01:13:24.629 --> 01:13:26.460
That's impossible.

01:13:26.531 --> 01:13:28.465
Someone has to go up there.

01:13:28.533 --> 01:13:30.433
And shut it down manually.

01:13:30.502 --> 01:13:32.800
It's the only way.

01:13:32.871 --> 01:13:35.066
But who?

01:13:35.140 --> 01:13:37.438
I'm ready.

01:13:37.509 --> 01:13:40.000
It must be done.

01:13:41.446 --> 01:13:42.913
Grandpa, no!

01:13:42.981 --> 01:13:45.848
Let him go.
Your grandfather has to do this.

01:13:56.094 --> 01:13:59.495
Thank you for freeing me,
Valentin, but it's too late.

01:13:59.564 --> 01:14:02.328
Nothing can stop me. Not even you.

01:14:03.268 --> 01:14:06.066
That's true. Only you can do that.

01:14:06.671 --> 01:14:08.730
You double-crossed us.

01:14:08.807 --> 01:14:12.106
The agency, your fellow agents, and me.

01:14:12.177 --> 01:14:15.203
Your mistake cost me my legs.

01:14:15.747 --> 01:14:16.873
Well, a mistake like that

01:14:16.948 --> 01:14:19.815
could only push someone
further into the dark.

01:14:19.885 --> 01:14:21.648
And it has.

01:14:21.720 --> 01:14:23.153
Look at you now.

01:14:23.221 --> 01:14:25.155
I gave you back your legs in the game.

01:14:25.223 --> 01:14:27.157
I did that for you.

01:14:28.326 --> 01:14:32.695
Let me tell you all the things
I've missed in my life

01:14:32.764 --> 01:14:35.995
because of the accident you caused.

01:14:36.601 --> 01:14:39.399
I can't walk on the beach with my wife.

01:14:40.272 --> 01:14:43.469
I missed my daughter's birth.

01:14:44.042 --> 01:14:45.634
And wedding.

01:14:46.912 --> 01:14:48.436
Shall I continue?

01:14:51.650 --> 01:14:54.016
Grandpa.

01:14:54.085 --> 01:14:55.712
Don't.

01:14:55.787 --> 01:15:00.156
Now let me tell you
all the good things that came of it.

01:15:01.092 --> 01:15:02.650
Humility.

01:15:02.727 --> 01:15:04.592
Spirituality.

01:15:04.663 --> 01:15:05.960
Understanding.

01:15:06.031 --> 01:15:09.728
You've been living in fear of me
all these years.

01:15:09.801 --> 01:15:12.326
But I've only been searching for you

01:15:12.404 --> 01:15:16.864
so I could tell you that I forgive you.

01:15:21.246 --> 01:15:25.706
I've only dreamed I would hear
you say something like that.

01:15:25.784 --> 01:15:30.016
Now the question is,
can you forgive yourself?

01:15:30.088 --> 01:15:33.387
It's never too late, Sebastian.

01:15:33.458 --> 01:15:36.655
Take your time.
Take your time to decide.

01:15:36.728 --> 01:15:39.822
We have about 10 seconds.

01:15:44.502 --> 01:15:46.163
Game...

01:15:47.472 --> 01:15:48.700
over.

01:15:51.977 --> 01:15:55.174
Juni, get out of there!

01:16:15.066 --> 01:16:16.829
Grandpa!

01:16:30.015 --> 01:16:31.812
So, wait a minute.

01:16:32.851 --> 01:16:35.081
Who won?

01:16:36.388 --> 01:16:39.186
It's not whether you win or lose.

01:16:39.257 --> 01:16:42.715
It's how you play the game.

01:16:44.062 --> 01:16:45.086
To family.

01:16:45.664 --> 01:16:46.790
To family.

01:16:46.865 --> 01:16:47.923
- To family.
- To family.

01:16:47.999 --> 01:16:50.297
- To family.
- To family.

01:16:50.368 --> 01:16:52.632
- To family.
- To family.

01:16:52.704 --> 01:16:53.693
To family.

01:16:53.938 --> 01:16:55.098
To family.

01:16:55.173 --> 01:16:56.231
- To family.
- To family.

01:16:56.308 --> 01:16:57.366
To family.

01:16:57.442 --> 01:16:59.273
- Family.
- <i>Familia.</i>

01:16:59.344 --> 01:17:02.108
- To family.
- To family.

01:17:02.347 --> 01:17:03.837
To family.

01:17:07.652 --> 01:17:09.984
And break!

01:17:45.457 --> 01:17:48.119
<i>## The time has come</i>

01:17:48.193 --> 01:17:50.252
<i>## Once and for all</i>

01:17:50.929 --> 01:17:53.727
<i>## You met your match</i>

01:17:53.798 --> 01:17:55.356
<i>## You will fall</i>

01:17:55.433 --> 01:17:58.197
<i>## This little game we play</i>
<i>is gonna break us down</i>

01:17:58.269 --> 01:18:00.863
<i>## Only one of us can wear the crown</i>

01:18:00.939 --> 01:18:03.635
<i>## It's not as easy as you thought it'd be</i>

01:18:03.708 --> 01:18:06.233
<i>## When it's down to you versus me</i>

01:18:07.379 --> 01:18:09.142
<i>## I play rough</i>

01:18:09.214 --> 01:18:12.149
<i>## I don't need to try</i>

01:18:12.217 --> 01:18:14.185
<i>## You like to play mean</i>

01:18:14.252 --> 01:18:16.846
<i>## But the score never lies</i>

01:18:17.455 --> 01:18:19.355
<i>## Game over</i>

01:18:20.225 --> 01:18:22.125
<i>## Game over</i>

01:18:22.927 --> 01:18:24.690
<i>## Game over</i>

01:18:25.530 --> 01:18:26.929
<i>## For now</i>

01:18:28.900 --> 01:18:31.368
- Like Valentin.
- Like Valentin.

01:18:31.436 --> 01:18:34.633
Val. More like that? Valentin.

01:18:34.706 --> 01:18:37.732
Hey, how you doin', Valentin?

01:18:37.809 --> 01:18:38.741
Hey, I know.

01:18:38.810 --> 01:18:41.404
All right. Here we go.
Settle, please.

01:18:41.479 --> 01:18:45.438
Yo, Valentin!
What are you doin' in space?

01:18:46.384 --> 01:18:47.544
You...

01:18:48.286 --> 01:18:49.446
OK.

01:18:52.090 --> 01:18:53.148
Oh!

01:18:58.062 --> 01:18:59.188
Take 'em down!

01:19:00.632 --> 01:19:03.032
OK. Fists. Good.

01:19:03.101 --> 01:19:05.092
What else is new?

01:19:05.170 --> 01:19:06.262
This is different.

01:19:06.337 --> 01:19:07.964
Once you get through the game,

01:19:08.039 --> 01:19:10.030
your mind belongs to the Toymaker.

01:19:10.108 --> 01:19:12.099
Aah!
Let's do it again right away.

01:19:12.177 --> 01:19:16.273
I'm coming back to settle the score.

01:19:17.615 --> 01:19:20.345
For imprisoning me.

01:19:20.418 --> 01:19:23.080
For using me.

01:19:27.692 --> 01:19:30.593
That might be the end
of my career right there.

01:19:32.230 --> 01:19:34.061
<i>## Game over</i>

01:19:34.899 --> 01:19:36.764
<i>## Game over</i>

01:19:37.535 --> 01:19:39.366
<i>## Game over</i>

01:19:40.205 --> 01:19:42.105
<i>## For now</i>

01:19:42.874 --> 01:19:45.536
<i>## Winning the game's</i>

01:19:45.610 --> 01:19:47.544
<i>## The only rule allowed</i>

01:19:48.246 --> 01:19:50.680
<i>## No more good luck</i>

01:19:50.748 --> 01:19:52.807
<i>## Or cheers from the crowd</i>

01:19:52.884 --> 01:19:55.478
<i>## When the game began</i>
<i>you never thought you'd lose</i>

01:19:55.553 --> 01:19:56.747
<i>## But your time is up</i>

01:19:56.821 --> 01:19:58.311
<i>## I play to bruise</i>

01:19:58.389 --> 01:20:00.983
<i>## Look around. In fact.</i>
<i>You've lost your team</i>

01:20:01.059 --> 01:20:04.028
<i>## You tried your best.</i>
<i>But you ran out of steam</i>

01:20:04.896 --> 01:20:06.921
<i>## I play rough</i>

01:20:06.998 --> 01:20:09.626
<i>## I don't need to try</i>

01:20:09.701 --> 01:20:11.635
<i>## You like to play mean</i>

01:20:11.703 --> 01:20:13.898
<i>## But the score never lies</i>

01:20:13.972 --> 01:20:15.963
<i>## You're all out of wishes</i>

01:20:16.040 --> 01:20:17.701
<i>## Kiss your dreams goodbye</i>

01:20:17.775 --> 01:20:19.402
<i>## The end's the same</i>

01:20:19.477 --> 01:20:21.809
<i>## It's not whether you win or lose</i>

01:20:21.880 --> 01:20:24.747
<i>## It's how you play the game</i>

01:20:25.683 --> 01:20:27.480
<i>## Game over</i>

01:20:28.253 --> 01:20:30.118
<i>## Game over</i>

01:20:30.922 --> 01:20:32.651
<i>## Game over</i>

01:20:33.591 --> 01:20:35.991
<i>## For now</i>

01:21:08.660 --> 01:21:10.389
<i>## Is that all you got?</i>

01:21:11.763 --> 01:21:13.094
<i>## Come on</i>

01:21:14.399 --> 01:21:16.196
<i>## Unh-unh</i>

01:21:16.267 --> 01:21:17.632
<i>## Bring it on</i>

01:21:19.170 --> 01:21:21.035
<i>## Game over</i>

01:21:21.606 --> 01:21:23.631
<i>## Game over</i>

01:21:24.442 --> 01:21:25.602
<i>## Game over</i>

01:21:26.945 --> 01:21:29.004
<i>## For now</i>

01:21:34.652 --> 01:21:37.883
<i>## Game over...</i>

01:21:52.537 --> 01:21:55.768
<i>## I'm trying to figure out</i>
<i>the rules. I don't lose</i>

01:21:55.840 --> 01:21:58.400
<i>## I'm tested. I've already seen</i>
<i>some bad dudes</i>

01:21:58.476 --> 01:22:01.502
<i>## Do what's in your nature.</i>
<i>Don't let 'em break you</i>

01:22:01.579 --> 01:22:04.309
<i>## Plan to win if they're</i>
<i>raising the stakes up</i>

01:22:04.382 --> 01:22:06.816
<i>## Now. You can take</i>
<i>a few bumps and bruises</i>

01:22:06.884 --> 01:22:09.409
<i>## I'm confident. I'm telling you.</i>
<i>You will not lose this</i>

01:22:09.487 --> 01:22:12.320
<i>## Life force is dwindling.</i>
<i>You're barely alive</i>

01:22:12.390 --> 01:22:15.723
<i>## Time to let go of the wheel</i>
<i>and let your heart drive</i>

01:22:15.793 --> 01:22:19.058
<i>## Just let your heart drive</i>

01:22:19.130 --> 01:22:21.325
<i>## Just let your heart drive</i>

01:22:22.500 --> 01:22:24.559
<i>## Come on. Come on</i>

01:22:26.871 --> 01:22:30.136
<i>## Just let your heart drive</i>

01:22:30.208 --> 01:22:32.904
<i>## Just let your heart drive</i>

01:22:51.929 --> 01:22:54.489
<i>## That's right. That's right</i>

01:22:54.565 --> 01:22:57.762
<i>## Just let your heart drive</i>

01:22:57.835 --> 01:23:00.030
<i>## Just let your heart drive</i>

01:23:01.072 --> 01:23:03.404
<i>## Come on. Come on</i>

01:23:05.677 --> 01:23:08.840
<i>## Just let your heart drive</i>

01:23:08.913 --> 01:23:11.541
<i>## Just let your heart drive</i>

01:23:20.024 --> 01:23:22.720
<i>## Let your heart drive...</i>

01:23:43.147 --> 01:23:44.842
Dad, he's imitating me.

01:23:44.916 --> 01:23:47.908
- Do that again.
- Dad, he's imitating me.

01:23:47.985 --> 01:23:49.885
He sounds just like you, honey.

01:23:49.954 --> 01:23:52.115
That's what I'm trying to
tell you.

01:23:52.190 --> 01:23:53.452
That's better.
Thank you, dear.

01:23:53.624 --> 01:23:56.388
That's better.
Thank you, dear.

01:23:58.663 --> 01:23:59.789
How long have you known?

01:23:59.864 --> 01:24:00.990
Since forever.

01:24:01.065 --> 01:24:02.760
Mom made me swear not to mention it.

01:24:02.834 --> 01:24:04.495
So why are you mentioning it?

01:24:04.569 --> 01:24:08.335
'Cause she also told me
never to swear, so now we're even.

01:24:08.406 --> 01:24:11.000
How's that for even?
You're on your own.

01:24:11.075 --> 01:24:12.940
Hey, wait!
I warned you!
