WEBVTT

01:24.544 --> 01:27.338
It's almost time
for the great army
to leave.

01:29.340 --> 01:32.051
We have to ask
the gods for their help.

01:32.218 --> 01:34.679
We have to prepare sacrifices.

01:35.346 --> 01:37.265
What shall we sacrifice?

01:38.266 --> 01:42.061
This will be the largest army
we have ever sent out.

01:44.147 --> 01:45.648
If the army fails...

01:46.191 --> 01:49.360
If they are defeated
by the Saxons,

01:49.444 --> 01:52.030
our peoples
might never recover.

01:56.451 --> 02:00.205
Whatever Ragnar and
I started long ago,

02:00.288 --> 02:03.166
will perish and
be forgotten.

02:06.085 --> 02:09.172
That would be
the price of failure.

02:09.964 --> 02:13.176
Then I repeat,
what shall we sacrifice?

02:15.637 --> 02:20.266
I think Lagertha means,
"Who shall we sacrifice?"

02:23.895 --> 02:25.355
<i>I want to ask you something.</i>

02:27.190 --> 02:30.401
Who will be the leader
of our great army?

02:31.569 --> 02:35.281
Maybe there won't
be a single leader,
but many.

02:35.365 --> 02:39.244
Father chose to take me
with him to England.

02:45.083 --> 02:48.253
And what is your point,
little brother, huh?

02:52.924 --> 02:56.636
He told me
that he wanted me to
learn at first hand,

02:56.719 --> 02:59.264
something of the Saxon ways.

03:01.224 --> 03:04.686
The landscape,
the buildings,

03:06.187 --> 03:07.689
and defenses.

03:11.150 --> 03:15.989
He said it would be useful
when we returned
to avenge him.

03:16.072 --> 03:20.493
Are you saying
he wanted you
to be our leader?

03:33.965 --> 03:35.508
Where are these ones from?

03:37.093 --> 03:39.637
They're Danes.
Don't you think?

03:40.805 --> 03:43.016
Yes. It's obvious.

03:49.230 --> 03:51.149
Look!
What? What?

03:52.650 --> 03:54.068
Can't you see her?

03:54.152 --> 03:55.486
Who? See who?

03:55.570 --> 03:57.572
It's her. It is!

03:57.655 --> 03:59.198
No, it's not!

03:59.282 --> 04:02.035
Yes, it is!
You know it is!

04:02.452 --> 04:05.913
That was the woman who
made me believe I had
to be King of all Norway

04:05.997 --> 04:07.624
before she would marry me.

04:09.834 --> 04:11.377
That is my princess.

04:13.880 --> 04:16.424
I think of her
every day of my life.

04:16.549 --> 04:18.635
That's her.

04:19.510 --> 04:22.472
Well, then you ought to
go say hello.

04:55.421 --> 04:56.631
Hvitserk!

05:04.055 --> 05:05.098
Brother.

05:09.686 --> 05:12.689
People from Norway,
Sweden, even Denmark.

05:12.772 --> 05:14.482
All to avenge Ragnar.

05:14.565 --> 05:17.276
Never before in memory
has it happened.

05:20.530 --> 05:23.366
Ivar wants to lead the army.

05:25.493 --> 05:26.619
What?

05:27.745 --> 05:29.330
Are you serious?

05:29.414 --> 05:33.251
He just told me.
He thinks our
father chose him.

05:34.043 --> 05:36.671
It's not right.
Bjorn should lead the army.

05:36.754 --> 05:38.047
I agree.
Bjorn should be leader.

05:38.131 --> 05:39.382
Then it's settled.

05:42.885 --> 05:45.430
What did you say
to Margrethe?

05:47.765 --> 05:49.142
Uh...

05:51.936 --> 05:54.397
I told her that
I've always loved her.

05:55.857 --> 05:59.610
But I understood you
had first claim to her.

06:19.756 --> 06:21.674
- And where are you from?
- I'm from Denmark.

06:21.758 --> 06:22.967
Princess Ellisif.

06:23.050 --> 06:25.136
And my name is Vik.

06:25.219 --> 06:26.846
Was it a long journey?

06:26.929 --> 06:28.723
It took us
four days to get here.

06:44.947 --> 06:46.741
Princess Ellisif.

06:50.578 --> 06:52.497
I'm surprised to see you.

06:52.580 --> 06:56.125
Why? Hasn't the whole
world come to Kattegat?

06:58.961 --> 07:01.756
Can it be you have forgotten?

07:02.006 --> 07:04.050
Of course
I haven't forgotten.

07:04.133 --> 07:08.554
You saw me, but you did not
bother to come and say hello.

07:11.516 --> 07:12.683
I'm sorry.

07:12.767 --> 07:14.227
I wanted to marry you.

07:15.686 --> 07:17.230
You turned me down.

07:17.313 --> 07:19.941
I wasn't important
enough for you.

07:20.024 --> 07:21.734
But now,

07:22.193 --> 07:25.446
I'm trying to be
very important.

07:25.655 --> 07:28.366
And I'm almost there.
Believe me.

07:29.200 --> 07:32.119
I'm already married...
And when I succeed,

07:32.203 --> 07:34.914
become King of Norway,

07:35.206 --> 07:39.210
I can cut my hair
and I can marry you.

07:41.921 --> 07:44.340
I'm already married.

07:51.806 --> 07:55.726
To whom are you married,
my beauty?

08:00.940 --> 08:01.941
Him?

08:11.492 --> 08:12.743
Is he a king?

08:12.827 --> 08:14.620
No.

08:14.704 --> 08:15.705
He's...

08:18.416 --> 08:20.918
An Earl in Denmark.

08:24.422 --> 08:26.465
An Earl?

08:28.426 --> 08:29.427
Yes.

08:30.928 --> 08:35.224
But I was already a king
and I was not
good enough for you.

08:35.308 --> 08:36.601
I'm sorry.

08:36.684 --> 08:40.271
You keep saying
that you're so sorry.

08:40.354 --> 08:45.359
But the point is,
you told me you
would wait and marry me

08:45.443 --> 08:49.947
when I become very important.

08:50.031 --> 08:52.575
But in the meantime,
you marry a nobody!

08:56.245 --> 09:00.249
I have built
my entire life around you.

09:01.167 --> 09:04.503
Everything I have done,
I have done for you,

09:04.587 --> 09:05.922
and the gods.

09:10.468 --> 09:14.472
I have dedicated
my life to you.

09:14.555 --> 09:16.307
Please, no!

09:23.856 --> 09:26.150
I love you.

09:28.152 --> 09:31.948
Please don't kill me.
Please.

10:02.353 --> 10:04.397
Get out of my way!

10:05.147 --> 10:08.943
Who gives this woman away
to her new husband?

10:09.026 --> 10:10.027
I do.

10:40.725 --> 10:43.602
And so,
I name you man and wife.

10:45.104 --> 10:47.398
And may the gods bless you,

10:49.900 --> 10:53.529
and give you children,
and may they keep
the wolf from the door.

10:57.074 --> 10:58.367
Mmm.

11:02.747 --> 11:03.706
Very good!

11:03.789 --> 11:05.499
And now, the bridal race!

11:05.583 --> 11:07.793
Go, go, go!

11:39.283 --> 11:41.535
You know the rules
of the race, brother.

11:41.619 --> 11:43.621
You have to serve the feast.

12:05.059 --> 12:06.727
What are you speaking of?

12:08.145 --> 12:12.149
Just our joy of
being together.
Of being alive.

12:14.485 --> 12:16.862
Is her name really Tanaruz?

12:17.321 --> 12:21.158
Yes. And I think I
know what it means.

12:23.160 --> 12:26.163
It means "the one
who brings hope."

12:26.247 --> 12:30.167
That is what her name means.
The one who brings hope.

12:32.294 --> 12:34.088
Tanaruz.

12:52.314 --> 12:54.859
Are you going
with the army?

12:54.942 --> 12:56.360
Of course.

12:57.403 --> 12:59.405
I have to avenge Ragnar.

13:01.657 --> 13:03.117
He loved me.

13:08.914 --> 13:10.708
But you should stay
here with Tanaruz.

13:11.041 --> 13:13.127
You have new
responsibilities now.

13:13.210 --> 13:15.588
No. We are coming with you.

13:15.713 --> 13:17.131
No.
Yes, we are a family now.

13:17.214 --> 13:19.091
Whatever happens,
we must be together.

13:19.174 --> 13:21.802
But the girl still
isn't eating properly.

13:21.886 --> 13:24.013
She doesn't seem
settled or happy.

13:25.681 --> 13:27.766
It is you that is
not happy, Floki.

13:28.475 --> 13:29.977
Something happened
to you in Algeciras,

13:30.060 --> 13:32.313
and you have
not been the same.

13:32.563 --> 13:34.899
What happened to you?

13:41.322 --> 13:43.407
I wish I could say.

13:46.160 --> 13:47.870
Why don't you try?

13:47.953 --> 13:50.456
I don't want to be imprecise.

13:51.916 --> 13:53.792
It's not a riddle.
No.

13:55.753 --> 13:56.921
It's a truth.

13:58.088 --> 14:00.090
I just don't know
what the truth is.

14:01.759 --> 14:04.178
The gods haven't
revealed it to me.

14:09.558 --> 14:11.435
Not yet, anyway.

14:18.233 --> 14:22.029
Come here, boy!

14:23.030 --> 14:24.657
My horn is empty.

14:24.740 --> 14:26.158
Mine, too!

14:28.869 --> 14:32.289
However much we
paid for this slave,
I think it was too much, hmm?

14:32.373 --> 14:34.458
Let's drink.

14:35.417 --> 14:37.002
To the newlyweds.

14:39.171 --> 14:40.172
Skol.

14:41.298 --> 14:42.633
Skol.

14:42.925 --> 14:44.385
Skol.

14:57.940 --> 14:59.858
Egil...

15:05.155 --> 15:08.075
You have seen
all you needed to?

15:08.158 --> 15:12.162
Enough to know they are
not as safe and secure
as they think they are.

15:14.915 --> 15:18.085
Go and make your plans.

15:19.002 --> 15:20.796
We wait to hear
of your success,

15:22.631 --> 15:23.757
Earl Egil.

15:39.022 --> 15:41.859
You should have killed Ellisif
when you had the chance.

15:43.152 --> 15:44.903
She dishonored you.

15:47.656 --> 15:52.202
I love all of our gods.
All of them.

15:53.829 --> 15:56.039
But I only love two people,

15:56.123 --> 15:59.543
you, my brother,
and my princess.

16:02.629 --> 16:05.507
If I decide
not to kill her,

16:06.383 --> 16:07.885
then no one can.

16:30.115 --> 16:33.160
To my wife
and to my brother.

16:40.000 --> 16:42.711
Why are you looking
at us like that?

16:43.837 --> 16:47.090
I don't think it's fair
that I should keep
Margrethe to myself.

16:48.675 --> 16:51.178
It doesn't feel right.

16:51.261 --> 16:53.931
We all wanted her
and just because
I'm the oldest...

16:58.769 --> 17:01.688
I know that you like
each other. I can see.

17:03.190 --> 17:06.360
So, what do you think,

17:08.445 --> 17:09.863
Hvitserk?

17:13.575 --> 17:17.371
I think that you
should ask Margrethe.

17:19.915 --> 17:22.793
You're talking
about sharing me?

17:22.876 --> 17:23.877
Yes.

17:30.884 --> 17:32.803
How can you
not be jealous?

17:34.263 --> 17:35.430
Either of you?

17:37.307 --> 17:38.976
Both of you?

17:39.643 --> 17:42.354
Because we are Vikings.

17:46.191 --> 17:49.236
Let's see if it's true.

18:39.036 --> 18:40.287
Come on, then.

18:42.414 --> 18:45.334
This is my marriage night.

18:49.379 --> 18:52.299
Let's go to bed.

19:39.137 --> 19:40.931
Brother! I envy you!

19:41.848 --> 19:45.686
Tonight, you will die
and feast with the gods.

19:45.769 --> 19:49.481
You will see Odin
and Thor face to face.

19:53.068 --> 19:55.278
Thank you,
my brother.

22:01.238 --> 22:03.281
So,
Earl Jorgensen,

22:05.075 --> 22:09.246
are you ready to
sacrifice your life
to appease and honor the gods?

22:10.413 --> 22:12.749
I am not afraid.

22:14.417 --> 22:15.710
The gods are ready.

25:22.564 --> 25:24.774
I hope
that was enjoyable.

25:27.110 --> 25:29.487
Otherwise,
it's not worth it.

25:45.545 --> 25:48.965
Brothers,
this is my decision.

25:50.717 --> 25:53.970
We refuse to share power
with any of
the other Kings and Earls,

25:54.304 --> 25:57.307
whoever they are,
or however powerful they are.

25:57.390 --> 25:59.100
Least of all, my brothers,

25:59.184 --> 26:01.352
King Harald Finehair
and his brother,

26:01.436 --> 26:04.355
for they are dedicated
to our overthrow.

26:04.439 --> 26:05.815
Is that understood?

26:08.151 --> 26:10.236
We are all
equally Ragnar's sons,

26:10.320 --> 26:11.988
but we are not
equal in battle.

26:12.989 --> 26:14.532
So, I will take the lead.

26:14.991 --> 26:18.703
I will establish
the battle plans,
and I will give the orders.

26:18.828 --> 26:20.413
Do you understand that?

26:22.665 --> 26:23.833
You don't agree, Ivar?

26:24.751 --> 26:26.044
I didn't say anything.

26:26.127 --> 26:27.337
You don't have to.

26:27.420 --> 26:30.090
Your age makes you believe
you know more than you do.

26:32.926 --> 26:37.013
But what do you know?
What have you done?

26:37.388 --> 26:38.890
What battles have you won

26:39.557 --> 26:43.186
and what battles
have you lost?

26:43.520 --> 26:45.688
For it is in failure,
my brothers,

26:45.772 --> 26:47.857
that is where we
learn the most.

26:47.941 --> 26:48.942
Really?

26:49.442 --> 26:51.486
You don't want to listen,
that is your choice.

26:53.530 --> 26:56.157
But I am the leader
of this great army.

26:56.699 --> 27:00.495
Me! And you will obey me.

27:01.704 --> 27:06.334
And if you do so, my brothers,
revenge for our father...

27:13.341 --> 27:14.592
...will be ours.

27:29.107 --> 27:30.441
You came to say goodbye?

27:30.525 --> 27:31.818
It is time.

27:34.279 --> 27:36.239
Mmm.

27:39.033 --> 27:41.119
Take care of Kattegat.

27:41.202 --> 27:42.412
Farewell, my son.

27:43.413 --> 27:46.749
Again, I place you in
the hands of the gods.

27:53.882 --> 27:55.258
Take care of my mother.

27:57.552 --> 27:58.887
She needs you.

28:08.938 --> 28:13.443
Farewell, Torvi,
mother of my children.

28:15.445 --> 28:19.032
I pray to the gods
that I will see
you and them again.

28:20.742 --> 28:21.784
And if not...
There are no "ifs",

28:23.411 --> 28:24.662
Bjorn Ironside.

28:26.414 --> 28:28.875
We shall all see you again.

28:33.171 --> 28:34.714
Father!
Father!

28:42.639 --> 28:44.557
Farewell, my son.

29:00.198 --> 29:02.158
Farewell, my children.

29:02.408 --> 29:06.496
Take care of your mother.
She's deserving of your love.

29:11.167 --> 29:14.671
I am less deserving.

29:16.339 --> 29:17.882
Still, I love you.

29:31.312 --> 29:32.647
I love you all.

30:03.177 --> 30:04.554
Where is the King?

30:17.233 --> 30:19.235
<i>Corpus Christi.</i>
Amen.

30:22.238 --> 30:24.324
Forgive me, sire...
Sacrilege!

30:26.117 --> 30:29.037
I was about to receive
the body and blood
of Christ, our Savior!

30:29.120 --> 30:31.539
You are also
about to receive
a great heathen army.

30:31.622 --> 30:32.999
They have landed
on the coast.

30:34.667 --> 30:36.753
Thank you.
Now, get out!

30:43.760 --> 30:46.554
The Lord comes
before all things.

30:48.014 --> 30:51.309
<i>Corpus Christi.</i>
Amen.

31:07.325 --> 31:08.826
They are here.

31:10.995 --> 31:13.873
Who? Who's here?

31:13.956 --> 31:16.125
The great heathen army.

31:20.296 --> 31:23.883
You'd better
listen to me, Father.

31:24.675 --> 31:26.135
I am. I'm listening.

31:28.721 --> 31:33.726
This is the army which has
come to revenge the death
of Ragnar Lothbrok.

31:33.810 --> 31:35.228
And it's all your fault.

31:35.311 --> 31:36.604
How is it all his fault?

31:36.687 --> 31:40.650
He freed Ragnar's son,
who would have
told them everything.

31:40.733 --> 31:42.777
Who would have
told them that we gave
Ragnar Lothbrok

31:42.860 --> 31:44.862
to King Aelle
to be killed.

31:44.946 --> 31:48.533
Sometimes,
God does things to test us.

31:48.658 --> 31:52.120
This has nothing
to do with God!

31:52.203 --> 31:55.706
This has to do with you.
And with me.

31:57.166 --> 31:59.293
Now, as you are my wife,
I could order you

31:59.377 --> 32:01.504
to leave my father
and I alone.

32:01.754 --> 32:03.840
But you're not
like most wives.

32:03.923 --> 32:07.718
So, I simply ask
if you would do so.

32:42.670 --> 32:44.755
You're angry with me.

32:44.839 --> 32:46.841
Of course
I'm angry with you.

32:49.260 --> 32:54.640
Most of my life,
you've either manipulated
or humiliated me.

32:56.893 --> 33:00.771
You used me to
fulfill your ambition,

33:02.064 --> 33:05.860
while at the same time,
taking my wife
as your mistress

33:05.943 --> 33:09.822
and forcing me to
adopt her bastard son.

33:11.282 --> 33:13.451
Please, tell me,

33:15.661 --> 33:17.288
what kind of
a father are you?

33:29.759 --> 33:32.386
Well, I'm not as good a father
as Ragnar Lothbrok was.

33:35.097 --> 33:38.809
I saw the love
he had for his son.
It moved me.

33:38.893 --> 33:41.354
It was one of the reasons
I decided not to kill his son.

33:41.437 --> 33:46.192
Not because he was crippled,
but because Ragnar loved him.

33:48.402 --> 33:51.614
In a way you've
never loved me?

33:55.910 --> 33:58.537
At least you're
being honest about it.

34:00.581 --> 34:03.751
I know you've always
found it hard
to be honest.

34:06.420 --> 34:09.882
Perhaps that's something
you learned from Charlemagne.

34:09.966 --> 34:14.929
What we learn from others
must chime with
something inside oneself.

34:15.012 --> 34:20.434
There must have always been
something cold, calculated,

34:20.518 --> 34:22.478
and perverted about me.

34:24.438 --> 34:28.067
I see it very clearly now.

34:28.150 --> 34:31.320
Ragnar helped me to see it.

34:32.196 --> 34:33.864
So did Athelstan.

34:36.534 --> 34:38.744
I hate that name.

34:38.828 --> 34:40.579
Well, of course you do.

34:40.663 --> 34:43.374
He was a man of God
who put his prick
into your wife.

34:44.166 --> 34:49.213
He betrayed his calling,
sired a bastard,
he renounced our God,

34:49.338 --> 34:50.423
and yet...
And yet.

34:50.506 --> 34:55.636
He was
the most holy man

34:55.720 --> 34:57.888
I ever knew!

34:59.056 --> 35:03.269
I loved him because
the Holy Spirit
lived through him.

35:03.352 --> 35:05.646
And I believe that's
why Ragnar loved him.

35:05.730 --> 35:06.856
Ragnar was a pagan!

35:06.939 --> 35:08.357
Well, if the Holy Spirit
is true and real,

35:08.441 --> 35:10.568
it lives through all men,
pagan or not!

35:10.693 --> 35:12.153
That's not true!
How can you ever say that?

35:12.236 --> 35:14.864
Because I watched
Ragnar die!

35:16.073 --> 35:20.411
I saw the Holy Spirit
moving in him!

35:20.578 --> 35:22.705
Oh, you are mistaken.

35:22.788 --> 35:25.875
You saw what
you wanted to see.

35:44.560 --> 35:46.979
Perhaps you're right.

35:47.063 --> 35:49.357
Why deny it?

35:49.440 --> 35:52.318
We're born alone,
we die alone,

35:52.401 --> 35:56.072
and we make what
we can of life.

36:05.247 --> 36:07.500
You're not behaving
like a King anymore.

36:12.046 --> 36:14.090
People are already
talking about it.

36:16.425 --> 36:19.637
You're distracted,
you're withdrawn.

36:19.720 --> 36:21.722
You seem unsure,
and hesitant,

36:21.806 --> 36:24.517
when once you were firm,
you were strong.

36:24.600 --> 36:29.355
Oh, I am filled with doubts.

36:29.438 --> 36:34.276
And I've begun to
believe that being firm
and strong was the illusion

36:34.360 --> 36:37.405
and that I am unsure now

36:37.488 --> 36:40.991
because it is
the most honest way to be.

36:41.075 --> 36:45.621
Not in the face of
a great heathen army that
are come to destroy us.

36:46.414 --> 36:51.377
That is why I have placed you
in command of our armies.

36:51.460 --> 36:54.296
I trust you completely.

36:58.134 --> 37:01.178
It's why I always used you.

37:10.354 --> 37:12.273
You loved Athelstan.

37:14.150 --> 37:15.317
Right?

37:16.986 --> 37:19.947
You love Ragnar Lothbrok.

37:23.576 --> 37:24.827
You love Judith.

37:27.121 --> 37:28.289
Right?

37:35.421 --> 37:38.007
Do you love me, Father?

37:40.342 --> 37:41.552
Do you?

37:43.179 --> 37:45.681
Because if you do,
I want you to say so.

37:46.724 --> 37:48.851
I need you to say so.

37:51.020 --> 37:52.229
Please.

37:53.439 --> 37:54.732
Please.

38:06.994 --> 38:08.412
Judith warned us.

38:08.496 --> 38:11.207
She had no need to warn us.
I was already prepared.

38:11.290 --> 38:12.791
I'm still frightened.

38:12.875 --> 38:14.460
It is in the interests
of the Northmen

38:14.543 --> 38:16.212
to have a reputation
as great warriors.

38:16.795 --> 38:18.422
It's half the battle.

38:18.506 --> 38:21.217
It sows the seeds of fear
in those who oppose them.

38:22.718 --> 38:25.721
But, believe me,
I'm not afraid.

38:25.804 --> 38:28.057
I don't believe
in their reputation.

38:28.807 --> 38:32.937
God knows, I hope it is
the sons of Ragnar who have
landed on our shores.

38:33.437 --> 38:35.940
For I have prepared
a very special
welcome for them.

38:36.398 --> 38:40.319
They're about to discover
they can no longer attack us

38:40.402 --> 38:42.196
with impunity.

38:54.625 --> 38:56.335
- Amen.
- Amen.

39:12.601 --> 39:16.563
My Lord Bishop,
let us go to war!

39:28.951 --> 39:30.619
What did he want?

39:32.663 --> 39:34.957
He wanted what
everyone wants.

39:36.625 --> 39:38.460
He wants to be loved.

39:40.421 --> 39:42.131
I understand that.

39:47.261 --> 39:49.221
Come to bed.

39:49.305 --> 39:53.976
No, I was enjoying
just looking at you.

40:03.610 --> 40:05.821
I feel
my eyes are dimming.

40:08.782 --> 40:13.162
My mind is more
confused every day.

40:16.540 --> 40:20.669
I struggle now with
just ordinary things.

40:30.679 --> 40:34.516
You have always carried
a very heavy burden.

40:36.518 --> 40:40.481
Perhaps now is the time
to relinquish it.

40:40.773 --> 40:43.525
Why not renounce the crown
in favor of your son?

40:44.651 --> 40:46.820
Now, that is for me
to decide, not you!

40:55.329 --> 40:59.041
My son will know
the burden soon enough.

40:59.458 --> 41:02.378
In any case,

41:02.461 --> 41:05.214
I feel in my bones
there's still something...

41:05.297 --> 41:08.550
Something important
left for me to do.

41:11.678 --> 41:16.892
But you should consider
going back to him, my love.

41:17.434 --> 41:20.396
Formally, properly.

41:22.481 --> 41:24.400
I don't love him.

41:24.775 --> 41:26.402
Love isn't everything.

41:29.113 --> 41:34.660
We need to think of Alfred.
His future is of
the highest importance.

41:34.743 --> 41:39.998
And very soon,
my son will be a better
protector than I am.

41:45.921 --> 41:49.425
Behold, a people shall
come from the North,

41:49.508 --> 41:52.469
and a great nation,
and many kings

41:52.553 --> 41:55.848
shall be raised up
from the coasts of the Earth.

41:55.931 --> 41:58.684
They shall hold
the bow and the lance,

41:58.767 --> 42:02.062
they are cruel,
and will not show mercy...

42:31.592 --> 42:35.095
Not such a great army,
after all,
my Lord Bishop.

42:35.929 --> 42:37.181
Archers!

42:44.771 --> 42:46.899
What do you think,
Your Grace?

42:46.982 --> 42:51.236
Can we not expect to
dispose of these
heathens quite easily?

44:23.161 --> 44:24.496
God help us!

44:27.082 --> 44:29.251
I don't think He can.

44:51.398 --> 44:53.275
Ragnar!

44:59.114 --> 45:02.451
Ragnar!

46:43.969 --> 46:47.681
This is where our
father was killed.

47:35.270 --> 47:38.273
I've been told your
god is a carpenter.

47:38.356 --> 47:41.109
And guess what? So am I.

48:36.998 --> 48:38.208
Christ!

50:59.349 --> 51:01.977
<i>How the little piggies
will grunt,</i>

51:02.060 --> 51:05.480
<i>when they hear
how the older boar suffered.</i>
