01:58.719 --> 02:00.553
You've always
had bad dreams...

02:00.554 --> 02:03.489
<i>...ever since you were tiny.</i>

02:05.258 --> 02:06.738
<i>You'd wake up screaming
in your cot...</i>

02:09.830 --> 02:12.498
<i>...as if the world
had ended.</i>

02:14.468 --> 02:17.903
<i>But your world hadn't
even started to end</i>

02:21.475 --> 02:23.442
<i>until last summer.</i>

02:23.443 --> 02:25.811
<i>Up until then, you'd had
a perfect childhood.</i>

02:29.716 --> 02:32.351
<i>Not a worry in the world.</i>

02:32.352 --> 02:35.654
<i>Not a care in your heart,
not a stain in sight.</i>

02:36.390 --> 02:39.925
<i>Do you remember?</i>

02:41.662 --> 02:43.596
<i>Do you remember
what it felt like?</i>

02:43.597 --> 02:44.930
<i>Mom and Dad
still so in love.</i>

02:47.801 --> 02:49.402
<i>You, their beloved daughter.</i>

02:49.403 --> 02:52.571
Oh, <i>! ime gusta, me gusta!</i>

02:52.572 --> 02:55.374
I'm 15! I don't
want to see that.
Oh, grow up!

02:55.375 --> 02:57.576
<i>Until that moment...</i>

02:57.577 --> 03:00.680
<i>on the balcony,
when everything changed.</i>

03:00.681 --> 03:02.121
<i>When Dad's hands
started to tremble.</i>

03:03.250 --> 03:05.818
<i>And he said
in full daylight,</i>

03:07.821 --> 03:09.955
<i>how strange it's dark.</i>

03:12.659 --> 03:15.594
<i>That was the end
of your perfect childhood.</i>

03:39.653 --> 03:42.354
It's multiple sclerosis.

03:53.967 --> 03:56.702
<i>It's funny.</i>

03:56.703 --> 03:59.004
<i>The grief
is making me strong.</i>

03:59.005 --> 04:01.273
<i>But it's making you weak.</i>

04:03.510 --> 04:05.578
<i>I've waited so long.</i>

04:12.719 --> 04:14.687
<i>But the time is close now.</i>

04:28.335 --> 04:31.337
<i>The time for me to come.</i>

04:53.794 --> 04:56.529
<i>With no one there
to stop me.</i>

05:03.537 --> 05:05.471
<i>You will disappear.</i>

05:09.943 --> 05:12.845
<i>And no one will know it.</i>

05:20.453 --> 05:21.787
Hey, baby.

05:21.788 --> 05:22.788
Thank you.

05:23.390 --> 05:26.559
Excuse me.

05:29.563 --> 05:31.096
Okay. Good afternoon.

05:31.097 --> 05:32.698
Good afternoon.

05:32.699 --> 05:33.899
Let's try that again.

05:33.900 --> 05:35.100
Good afternoon, John.

05:35.101 --> 05:37.436
Good afternoon, John.

05:37.437 --> 05:39.672
Good afternoon.
Lovely to see y'all.

05:39.673 --> 05:41.974
I'm delighted to see
so many of you turned up

05:41.975 --> 05:44.109
after last week's
insalubrious auditions.

05:44.110 --> 05:45.578
But, hey, you'd do anything

05:45.579 --> 05:47.139
to get out of maths class,
wouldn't you?

05:47.881 --> 05:49.748
Ah, you would, wouldn't you?

05:49.749 --> 05:50.783
Right.

05:50.784 --> 05:52.585
Without further ado.

05:52.586 --> 05:55.020
Macbeth...
Drew Fraser.

05:57.991 --> 06:01.861
Your new neighbor.

06:01.862 --> 06:03.062
Thank you.

06:03.063 --> 06:05.030
Dan Jones,

06:05.031 --> 06:07.132
his understudy.

06:07.133 --> 06:10.436
Well done, Dan.

06:10.437 --> 06:11.837
Gus Philips...
you will play Duncan.

06:13.707 --> 06:15.608
Peter Lane will play Banquo.

06:17.110 --> 06:20.145
Now...

06:21.915 --> 06:23.916
the most important character

06:23.917 --> 06:26.852
in the Scottish tragedy.

06:26.853 --> 06:31.023
Who's going to be
that cruel, insidious,

06:31.024 --> 06:33.158
beautiful queen?

06:33.159 --> 06:35.160
Fay Delussey...

06:36.429 --> 06:37.630
why don't you
come join us?

06:38.899 --> 06:40.866
Now, Fay, come on.

06:40.867 --> 06:43.636
Her understudy
will be Monica Meldrum.

06:49.175 --> 06:51.176
It's okay,
you can smile, Monica.

06:52.913 --> 06:54.780
It's allowed.

06:54.781 --> 06:57.149
Sara Simpson...
Lady Macduff.

06:58.985 --> 07:01.225
You're gonna have to rehearse
with Drew, like, every day.

07:02.989 --> 07:04.189
Don't even get me started.

07:04.190 --> 07:06.525
Don't look
so smug, Delussey.

07:06.526 --> 07:08.594
You do know why you got
that part, don't you?

07:08.595 --> 07:10.663
Uh, raw talent?

07:10.664 --> 07:12.197
Talent, my ass.

07:12.198 --> 07:13.799
He just feels sorry for you.

07:13.800 --> 07:15.567
That's all.

07:15.568 --> 07:17.636
You got a pity part.

07:17.637 --> 07:19.471
Everybody here
feels sorry for you

07:19.472 --> 07:20.773
because your father's dying.

07:20.774 --> 07:22.942
Don't listen
to a word

07:24.711 --> 07:26.011
of what that
loser says.

07:26.012 --> 07:28.147
Yeah, totally.
She's just jealous.

07:34.955 --> 07:36.789
Are you sure you're
all right, babes?

07:36.790 --> 07:38.490
Yeah, yeah. I'm fine.

07:38.491 --> 07:39.658
You swear?

07:39.659 --> 07:40.859
Honest.

07:40.860 --> 07:41.961
Anyway, I'll see you guys later.

07:41.962 --> 07:43.729
Okay, bye.

07:43.730 --> 07:44.830
Bye!

07:44.831 --> 07:45.831
Bye.
Bye.

07:45.832 --> 07:47.800
Bye, chicken.

07:50.670 --> 07:52.171
Nice!

08:39.753 --> 08:40.818
Hey!

08:40.820 --> 08:42.054
Drew, what the hell?

08:42.054 --> 08:43.655
You look like you've
seen a ghost.

08:43.655 --> 08:45.024
Don't do that.

08:45.025 --> 08:46.025
Sorry.

08:46.626 --> 08:49.661
Nice pictures.

08:51.898 --> 08:53.165
Thanks.
I got to run.

08:53.166 --> 08:54.299
I'm later already.

08:54.300 --> 08:55.300
Okay. Bye.

09:31.638 --> 09:34.807
A man has been
arrested in connection

09:36.943 --> 09:39.077
with the abduction and suspected
murder of a teenage girl...

09:39.078 --> 09:40.612
Fay.

09:40.613 --> 09:42.114
I didn't hear you come in.

09:42.115 --> 09:43.949
How are you?

09:43.950 --> 09:45.083
The fog's awful.

09:45.084 --> 09:46.685
Yeah, it's bad, isn't it?

09:46.686 --> 09:48.353
Probably why Mom's late.

09:48.354 --> 09:50.956
Yeah, probably.

09:50.957 --> 09:53.258
How was your day?

09:53.259 --> 09:55.694
I got the main part
in the school play, so...

09:55.695 --> 09:56.695
Oh, well done.

09:56.696 --> 09:57.696
That's wonderful.

09:57.697 --> 10:00.065
Your mum will be thrilled.

10:00.066 --> 10:02.367
...on the night
the victim went missing.

10:02.368 --> 10:03.969
The victim has been staying
with her aunt...

10:03.970 --> 10:04.970
Ah.

10:04.971 --> 10:06.371
...and had left the residence...

10:06.372 --> 10:07.806
It's terrible, isn't it?

10:07.807 --> 10:09.374
Not much older
than you.

10:09.375 --> 10:12.211
Promise me you'll
be careful, darling...

10:13.847 --> 10:16.715
Oh, Dad, don't be such a nutter.
I just want you

10:16.716 --> 10:17.950
to be safe.

10:17.951 --> 10:18.951
Okay?

10:20.720 --> 10:22.654
Hey.

10:24.023 --> 10:25.123
Fay.

10:26.392 --> 10:28.126
What is it?

10:28.127 --> 10:29.995
Oh, it's nothing.

10:29.996 --> 10:31.396
It's nothing, honest.

10:32.732 --> 10:34.233
You can always talk to me, love.

10:34.234 --> 10:35.801
- I couldn't get a bus.
- Okay?

10:37.103 --> 10:38.270
I'm not going anywhere soon.

10:38.271 --> 10:40.239
I had to walk back.

10:42.976 --> 10:44.877
Almost got lost.

10:48.047 --> 10:49.081
How are you, darlings?

10:50.683 --> 10:51.683
Fine, yeah.

10:51.684 --> 10:53.685
Good.
Yeah?

10:53.686 --> 10:54.686
Fay?

10:54.687 --> 10:56.054
Yeah, all right.

10:56.055 --> 10:57.723
Well, um...
how was school?

10:59.325 --> 11:00.425
Tell Mum your news.

11:02.295 --> 11:03.295
You tell her.

Good morning,
Mrs. Brennan.

12:48.001 --> 12:49.935
Morning, Mrs. Delussey.

12:49.936 --> 12:50.936
Fay.

12:50.937 --> 12:51.937
Hi.

12:57.410 --> 12:58.477
Everything all right?

12:58.478 --> 13:00.345
Oh, yes.

13:00.346 --> 13:01.346
Yes.

13:03.483 --> 13:05.317
Such a wonderful head of hair.
Oh.

13:14.027 --> 13:16.395
You'd never think I had
hair as lovely as that.

13:23.102 --> 13:24.102
Oh, no!

13:24.103 --> 13:25.437
Not again!

13:27.006 --> 13:28.507
This lift is always
the one to break down,

13:28.508 --> 13:30.308
<i>ever the even one.
Can you explain me that?</i>

13:30.309 --> 13:32.077
They were both put
in at the same time.

13:32.078 --> 13:33.812
Strange.

13:33.813 --> 13:35.547
Kill someone someday.

13:37.517 --> 13:39.217
It's a hazard.

13:42.488 --> 13:45.457
I'll have to get in touch
with that lazy landlord.

13:45.458 --> 13:46.992
Ah!

13:46.993 --> 13:49.227
Mustn't be late for school.

13:50.963 --> 13:52.297
Oh, I'm sure she'll be fine.

13:52.298 --> 13:54.199
Yes, but she was quite
right yesterday

13:54.200 --> 13:56.268
to take the stairs.

13:56.269 --> 13:58.203
She's got young legs.

13:58.204 --> 13:59.504
She should use them.

13:59.505 --> 14:01.940
I took the lift
yesterday, Mrs. Brennan.

14:04.043 --> 14:06.611
Don't be daft.

14:06.612 --> 14:09.281
Yesterday, I saw you
going down the stairs.

14:09.282 --> 14:11.216
Plain as day.

14:11.217 --> 14:14.886
Seriously, I haven't used
the stairs since we moved in.

14:14.887 --> 14:15.887
Bye, Mrs. Brennan.

14:15.888 --> 14:17.189
Bye, now.

14:20.326 --> 14:22.227
Bye, love.

15:22.488 --> 15:25.157
'Tis safer to be
that which we destroy

15:25.158 --> 15:27.292
than by destruction dwell...

15:27.293 --> 15:28.460
Um...

15:28.461 --> 15:29.995
Dwell in doubtful...

15:33.699 --> 15:34.699
Okay.

15:34.700 --> 15:37.202
Okay, stop.

15:38.204 --> 15:40.172
It's okay.
Fay...

15:40.173 --> 15:41.506
I need you to relax.

15:41.507 --> 15:42.607
Okay?

15:42.608 --> 15:45.177
Just take a breath.

15:47.647 --> 15:49.147
'Tis safer to be
that which we destroy

15:51.083 --> 15:53.451
than by
destruction

15:53.452 --> 15:55.487
dwell in
doubtful joy.

15:55.488 --> 15:56.555
Okay?

15:56.556 --> 15:58.523
Try again.

15:58.524 --> 16:00.325
'Tis safer to be that
which we destroy

16:03.329 --> 16:06.331
than by destruction dwell...

16:06.332 --> 16:09.067
In doubtful joy.

16:09.068 --> 16:10.068
Dwell in doubtful joy.

16:13.739 --> 16:16.474
I'm sorry. I can't
concentrate.

16:16.475 --> 16:18.076
I've learned
it, but, um...

16:18.077 --> 16:20.045
Monica.

16:20.046 --> 16:21.646
Look, today's the first day
of rehearsal.

16:24.317 --> 16:25.617
I want everybody to note that.

16:25.618 --> 16:29.387
This is the first day
of rehearsals.

16:29.388 --> 16:31.223
No one's going to criticize you.

16:31.224 --> 16:32.724
I'm certainly not
going to judge you.

16:32.725 --> 16:34.492
And no one's paying for this.

16:34.493 --> 16:35.560
Okay.

16:37.063 --> 16:39.164
In the staff room, there's a DVD

16:39.165 --> 16:40.699
of Roman Polanski's
version of <i>Macbeth.</i>

16:40.700 --> 16:42.567
Francesca Annis gives a
brilliant performance in it.

16:42.568 --> 16:45.003
I want you to go
take a look at it, okay?

16:45.004 --> 16:46.371
I'll go get it
now, shall I?

16:46.372 --> 16:48.073
Great.

16:48.074 --> 16:50.041
And, Fay, relax.

16:50.042 --> 16:51.376
Meanwhile...

16:52.545 --> 16:53.778
Um, let me see.

16:57.183 --> 16:59.718
Andrew. Center
stage, please.

18:09.255 --> 18:11.589
Hello?

18:11.590 --> 18:13.558
Is someone in here?

18:21.534 --> 18:22.867
Help, someone, help!

18:22.868 --> 18:24.202
Help! Somebody help me!

18:26.272 --> 18:27.539
Help! Somebody help me!

18:29.809 --> 18:32.444
What's wrong?
Why are you screaming?

18:32.445 --> 18:33.878
Someone was coming after me.

18:33.879 --> 18:35.347
Well, who was it?
I don't know.

18:35.348 --> 18:36.614
What the hell?

18:36.615 --> 18:38.483
Who's been tampering
with my lights?

18:38.484 --> 18:40.618
I didn't touch your lights.
Someone was coming after me.

18:40.619 --> 18:43.321
Why was someone following you?
I don't know. They were coming.

18:43.322 --> 18:45.423
Are you sure this wasn't just,
like, your imagination or...
It was not my imagination.

18:45.424 --> 18:47.759
Someone was
running after me.

18:47.760 --> 18:50.428
You causing a scene, Fay?

18:50.429 --> 18:53.631
What, the main part
not enough limelight for you?

18:53.632 --> 18:55.767
Yeah, look, come on,

18:55.768 --> 18:59.738
enough fun and games, now, yeah?
Go home, now. Go home.

18:59.739 --> 19:00.905
All right, guys,

19:00.906 --> 19:02.507
let's get
out of here.

19:02.508 --> 19:04.642
When did Monica
leave the rehearsal?

19:04.643 --> 19:06.511
She left
after you did.

19:06.512 --> 19:08.480
You think
it was her?

19:21.394 --> 19:23.395
Well, Lady Macbeth,
I never thought you'd

19:23.396 --> 19:24.863
take method acting
so seriously.

19:24.864 --> 19:27.565
Piss off, Drew,
it's not funny.

19:27.566 --> 19:30.835
Monica Meldrum is totally
trying to screw with my head.

19:30.836 --> 19:32.804
Yeah, and succeeding,
by the look of things.

19:32.805 --> 19:34.272
Jesus, relax.

19:34.273 --> 19:36.241
Sorry.

19:43.883 --> 19:45.917
Want me to walk you home?

19:45.918 --> 19:47.318
Mum's coming
to pick me up.

19:52.291 --> 19:55.560
All right, well, I'll, uh...
I'll see you tomorrow, then.

19:55.561 --> 19:57.529
Bye.
Bye.

20:15.581 --> 20:16.815
How was school?

20:20.820 --> 20:23.455
How did the
rehearsal go?

20:23.456 --> 20:25.890
Oh, great.
Yeah, it was brilliant.

20:25.891 --> 20:27.725
I totally nailed it.

20:27.726 --> 20:29.794
In fact, everything's brilliant.

20:29.795 --> 20:31.262
Almost too good
to be true.

20:31.263 --> 20:33.965
I feel like
I'm living in paradise.

22:57.009 --> 22:58.977
Let us suppose that

22:58.978 --> 23:02.480
Y minus four equals 41.

23:02.481 --> 23:06.017
Who can tell me the value of Y?

23:06.018 --> 23:07.752
Fay?

23:07.753 --> 23:09.387
Fay Delussey?

23:09.388 --> 23:11.089
Yeah? What?

23:11.090 --> 23:13.024
At the same time, as soon
as Lady Macbeth hears

23:15.761 --> 23:18.630
that Duncan's coming
under her battlements,

23:18.631 --> 23:20.565
as soon as you hear he's coming,

23:20.566 --> 23:22.934
your plan starts in your head.

23:22.935 --> 23:24.936
The mechanics
start working, yeah?

23:24.937 --> 23:25.970
Yeah.

23:25.971 --> 23:28.873
Should we try it?

23:28.874 --> 23:29.874
Okay.

23:31.043 --> 23:33.511
My dearest love,

23:35.147 --> 23:38.650
Duncan comes here tonight.

23:38.651 --> 23:41.886
And when goes hence?

23:41.887 --> 23:42.887
Tomorrow as he purposes.

23:45.124 --> 23:46.924
Oh, never shall sun
that morrow see.

23:50.496 --> 23:52.597
Okay, you just remember.

23:54.633 --> 23:56.000
He's just seen Malcolm...

23:56.001 --> 23:57.602
Three pounds.

23:59.204 --> 24:00.738
Seriously!
You know,

24:00.739 --> 24:03.941
I bet the scales are rigged
to keep you coming back.

24:03.942 --> 24:05.810
I knew I shouldn't
have refreshed my lipstick

24:05.811 --> 24:06.844
before the weigh-in...

24:06.845 --> 24:09.013
Oh, come on!

24:09.014 --> 24:10.948
I starved myself all week.

24:16.922 --> 24:18.956
Good night, Mira.

24:18.957 --> 24:20.925
Bye.
Bye.

24:40.212 --> 24:42.547
You all right, Fay?

24:42.548 --> 24:44.248
Has that been fixed already?

24:44.249 --> 24:46.117
Yeah, I think so.
It just went up, so...

24:46.118 --> 24:47.719
I wouldn't trust it, yeah?

24:47.720 --> 24:49.554
Could swear they said
it would take a few days.

24:49.555 --> 24:51.589
Take this one.

24:51.590 --> 24:53.958
Oh! Sorry, too late.

24:53.959 --> 24:57.028
Hey, come on!

24:57.029 --> 24:58.863
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah.

24:58.864 --> 25:00.198
Come on.

26:03.662 --> 26:05.029
Fay?

26:05.030 --> 26:07.698
Fay, is that you?

26:07.699 --> 26:09.834
Yes, Mrs. Brennan, it's me.

26:09.835 --> 26:12.336
What are the noises?

26:12.337 --> 26:14.806
Just the lift.

26:14.807 --> 26:16.674
You didn't come up
in the bad one, did you?

26:16.675 --> 26:18.810
No, Mrs. Brennan,
I took the other one.

26:21.814 --> 26:24.682
Night, Mrs. Brennan.

26:24.683 --> 26:26.184
Good night.

26:32.691 --> 26:33.958
Fay?

26:33.959 --> 26:36.127
Ann?

26:36.128 --> 26:38.095
What, darling?

26:38.096 --> 26:39.897
Was that Fay who came in now?

26:49.107 --> 26:50.107
I worry about her.

26:51.076 --> 26:53.911
She's-she's a teenager.

26:56.982 --> 26:59.984
She needs space.

26:59.985 --> 27:01.953
Don't fuss so much.

27:13.966 --> 27:16.801
Hadn't you arranged
to meet your, um...

27:16.802 --> 27:19.003
your girlfriends tonight?

27:19.004 --> 27:21.005
Yeah.

27:21.006 --> 27:23.908
Well, go.

27:23.909 --> 27:25.943
Please.

27:25.944 --> 27:28.145
Just go.
I don't
have to go.

27:28.146 --> 27:30.414
I mean, I'm-I'm really happy
to stay...
Just...

27:30.415 --> 27:32.383
just go out.

27:40.025 --> 27:42.126
Oh, sorry, I didn't know
you were in here.

27:42.127 --> 27:45.129
Mmm. I'm almost done.

27:45.130 --> 27:47.865
I'm almost done.

27:47.866 --> 27:50.067
Going out?
Yeah.

27:50.068 --> 27:52.069
Yeah, with the girls.

27:52.070 --> 27:56.040
There's some, um...
some lasagna in the oven.

29:14.786 --> 29:15.786
Fay!

29:16.788 --> 29:18.289
Fay!
What's wrong?

29:18.290 --> 29:19.957
You okay? What
are you doing?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

29:19.958 --> 29:21.225
I'm fine.
What are you
doing? You okay?

29:21.226 --> 29:23.160
Uh, yeah, no.
I was just, um...

29:23.161 --> 29:25.129
doing my homework.

29:25.130 --> 29:26.964
Okay.

29:28.934 --> 29:30.835
Okay.

29:32.804 --> 29:34.772
Come sit down with me.

29:49.988 --> 29:51.856
Come on. You can stop this now.

29:54.393 --> 29:57.194
You were in full view
of everyone.

30:16.882 --> 30:18.349
Bye, Dad.

30:18.350 --> 30:19.583
Bye, love.

30:19.584 --> 30:21.318
Where's Mum?

30:21.319 --> 30:23.821
She went
to work ages ago.

30:23.822 --> 30:26.590
But I just heard you talking
with her.

30:26.591 --> 30:28.459
She was crying.

30:28.460 --> 30:30.294
It was
the radio.

30:30.295 --> 30:33.064
Radio was on.

30:33.065 --> 30:35.266
Oh.

30:35.267 --> 30:36.267
Oh, okay. Bye.

30:37.002 --> 30:40.104
Bye.

31:03.428 --> 31:04.995
Hey.

31:04.996 --> 31:06.964
Hi.

31:06.965 --> 31:09.567
You learned your lines?
Most. You?

31:12.037 --> 31:14.505
Uh, same, yeah.
The end of act two's impossible.

31:14.506 --> 31:16.474
Tell me about it.

31:33.058 --> 31:35.359
This is the very
painting of your fear.

31:35.360 --> 31:37.461
This is... the dagger.

31:37.462 --> 31:39.630
Okay, stop.

31:40.999 --> 31:42.333
Guys, what's happening?

31:42.334 --> 31:44.502
Fay, you need

31:44.503 --> 31:46.337
to turn Macbeth.

31:46.338 --> 31:50.508
You need to be the hand
that guides the sword.

31:50.509 --> 31:52.676
Do you understand
what I'm saying?

31:52.677 --> 31:54.979
I want you to do that
one more time.

31:54.980 --> 31:57.281
Monica, pay attention
to this, okay?

31:57.282 --> 31:59.984
So let's set it up again.

32:04.956 --> 32:07.591
Morning, Mrs. Brennan.

32:07.592 --> 32:09.660
What?

32:09.661 --> 32:11.495
Are you playing
games with me?

32:11.496 --> 32:13.264
Sorry?

32:13.265 --> 32:16.100
Just a minute ago, I just
saw you walking down the stairs.

32:16.101 --> 32:17.968
Don't play games with me!

32:17.969 --> 32:19.503
This is not <i>Gaslight.</i>

32:19.504 --> 32:23.140
What's go...? Mrs. Brennan,
I just came out my flat.

32:23.141 --> 32:25.309
I may be old,

32:25.310 --> 32:27.978
but I'm all right up here,
so you can go and play

32:27.979 --> 32:29.413
your silly little
games on someone else.

32:29.414 --> 32:30.614
<i>Gaslight!</i>

32:34.052 --> 32:37.021
Wait! Who are you?
Why are you doing this to me?

32:37.022 --> 32:38.455
<i>Wait! Who are you?</i>

32:38.456 --> 32:40.424
<i>Why are you doing this
to me?</i>

32:43.328 --> 32:44.328
Stop!

32:44.329 --> 32:46.030
<i>Stop!</i>

32:46.031 --> 32:47.064
Did you see her?

32:48.667 --> 32:50.334
See who?

32:50.335 --> 32:52.069
A girl, like me,
coming out of here.

32:52.070 --> 32:54.038
No one's come out.
You must have seen her.

32:54.039 --> 32:56.040
She must have run past you.

32:56.041 --> 32:57.708
No one's come out.
Mrs. Brennan,

32:57.709 --> 32:59.343
that wasn't me
you saw up there.

32:59.344 --> 33:01.078
That was somebody else.
Of course it was you.

33:01.079 --> 33:03.747
I'd never mistake
that beautiful hair.

33:24.102 --> 33:25.236
What have you got now?

33:25.237 --> 33:26.370
Um, science.

33:26.371 --> 33:27.705
Oh, okay.

33:27.706 --> 33:29.607
What on earth have
you done to your hair?

33:29.608 --> 33:31.642
Oh, my God.
Fay, have you looked

33:31.643 --> 33:33.077
in the mirror?
Look, I-I saw her.

33:33.078 --> 33:34.712
I-I almost saw her,
almost caught her.

33:34.713 --> 33:37.114
Mrs. Brennan saw her, or spoke
to her, even thought she was me.

33:37.115 --> 33:39.116
You saw who? Rewind.
Back up, you nutcase.

33:39.117 --> 33:41.218
Do you want to tell us
what the hell is going on?

33:41.219 --> 33:42.786
Me. Someone
who looks like me.

33:42.787 --> 33:46.090
Someone...
What's happening
to you, Fay?

33:46.091 --> 33:48.459
Someone's pretending to be me,
and it's totally messing

33:48.460 --> 33:50.194
with my head.
Why would someone do that?

33:50.195 --> 33:52.196
Oh, God knows. It's total
psycho stalking stuff.

33:52.197 --> 33:53.731
You don't think it's
Monica Meldrum?

33:53.732 --> 33:55.666
She's everywhere.
She's all over the place.

33:55.667 --> 33:57.668
I just couldn't believe
that Monica...
Fay?

33:57.669 --> 34:00.671
Head teacher's office, please.

34:05.277 --> 34:07.278
Fay!

34:07.279 --> 34:09.213
Fay, your hair... what happened?

34:09.214 --> 34:10.447
Fay?!

34:30.467 --> 34:33.704
Do you think that this
isn't difficult enough

34:33.705 --> 34:35.025
without you acting
like a lunatic?

34:36.341 --> 34:38.375
Do you really...

34:40.545 --> 34:43.547
do you really think this is what
your father needs right now?

34:44.181 --> 34:47.551
Just...

34:48.687 --> 34:51.221
tell me what's
going on, Fay.

34:51.222 --> 34:53.223
Maybe I can help you.

34:57.195 --> 35:00.597
There's someone...

35:00.598 --> 35:04.368
out there making
out... she's me.

35:04.369 --> 35:08.505
Like with Mrs.
Brennan in the lift.

35:08.506 --> 35:11.608
At school, the
other night.

35:11.609 --> 35:12.609
By the car outside.

35:13.578 --> 35:16.747
It's-it's like

35:18.683 --> 35:21.352
I've got a twin
or something.

35:21.353 --> 35:22.713
Whoever she is,
is identical to me.

35:23.521 --> 35:25.622
Oh, my...

35:27.625 --> 35:29.760
Mum, you're
freaking me out.

35:30.862 --> 35:33.897
You were a twin.

35:36.801 --> 35:38.836
You were an identical twin.

35:43.508 --> 35:45.708
There were complications
when I was pregnant, and I-I...

35:46.444 --> 35:48.779
I lost her.

35:50.348 --> 35:53.917
Oh, we had you.

35:55.887 --> 35:58.288
Did you bury her?

36:00.225 --> 36:01.859
Yeah.

36:07.799 --> 36:09.767
St. Stephen's Church.

36:14.672 --> 36:17.908
Layla.

36:17.909 --> 36:20.411
We called her
Layla Delussey.

You like it?

37:24.876 --> 37:27.010
It's knockout.

37:27.011 --> 37:29.480
It really suits you.

37:31.483 --> 37:33.550
Look at you all grown up.

37:34.886 --> 37:37.488
Come here,
give me a hug.

37:37.489 --> 37:39.490
Come here. Come here.
It's only a haircut, Dad.

37:39.491 --> 37:42.493
Come here. Come here.
Come here.

37:42.494 --> 37:44.328
Oh, my baby.

37:45.363 --> 37:48.699
Now, you be happy, be safe.

37:52.470 --> 37:54.438
And be strong.

37:54.439 --> 37:56.940
Everything will be okay
if you're strong.

38:00.512 --> 38:01.979
Hmm?

38:01.980 --> 38:02.980
Yeah?

38:03.948 --> 38:07.451
And don't you be
sad because of me.

38:10.455 --> 38:12.322
It'll make you weak.

38:12.323 --> 38:14.892
I can't protect you
for much longer.

38:14.893 --> 38:16.860
Dad, please.

38:16.861 --> 38:18.795
I'm sorry.

38:25.003 --> 38:26.803
I wish you hadn't kept Layla
a secret from me.

38:27.939 --> 38:30.641
I know.

38:32.510 --> 38:34.545
Your mum tells me
how upset you are.

38:34.546 --> 38:36.513
I'm sorry.

38:36.514 --> 38:38.982
I wish she hadn't died, Dad.

38:41.019 --> 38:42.452
Me, too.

38:44.422 --> 38:46.957
Me, too.

39:43.982 --> 39:45.716
Here she is.

39:45.717 --> 39:47.417
Oh, my God.
That is so cool.

39:47.418 --> 39:48.852
Wow, Fay.

39:48.853 --> 39:50.754
And very fancy.
Makeover time.

39:50.755 --> 39:52.456
Mmm.

39:52.457 --> 39:53.757
Fay. I hardly recognized you.

39:57.095 --> 40:00.097
He's so got your number.

40:02.000 --> 40:03.867
I don't know.

40:05.837 --> 40:06.903
<i>This is</i>

40:08.906 --> 40:11.074
the very painting
of your fear.

40:11.075 --> 40:13.010
This...

40:16.881 --> 40:18.401
This is the very painting
of your fear.

40:40.138 --> 40:42.172
This is the air-drawn dagger

40:42.173 --> 40:44.608
which you said
led you to Duncan.

40:44.609 --> 40:48.645
Oh, these flaws and starts,
impostors to true fear,

40:48.646 --> 40:50.080
would well become
a woman's story

40:50.081 --> 40:51.548
at a winter's fire

40:51.549 --> 40:53.784
authorized by her grandam.

40:53.785 --> 40:56.086
Shame itself! Why do
you make such faces?

40:56.087 --> 40:57.727
When all is done, you
look but on a stool.

41:14.939 --> 41:16.907
Have fun!

41:31.889 --> 41:33.890
There you go.
That one's yours.

41:33.891 --> 41:35.559
Thank you.
Be careful. It's hot.

41:35.560 --> 41:37.527
Okay, yeah.

41:43.101 --> 41:45.168
So, uh...

41:45.169 --> 41:47.804
any word from your evil twin?

41:47.805 --> 41:50.907
I mean, the look-alike
you've been talking about.

41:50.908 --> 41:52.743
Shit.

41:52.744 --> 41:54.711
What?

41:54.712 --> 41:56.747
My mum told me yesterday

41:58.750 --> 42:00.790
I had an identical twin
that died before I was born.

42:02.854 --> 42:05.155
I'm sorry. I wouldn't...
No, that's fine. It's...

42:07.892 --> 42:09.052
it's just a bit
weird and sad.

42:10.795 --> 42:12.796
Yeah, I bet.

42:14.599 --> 42:16.233
My mum reckons
my dad...

42:16.234 --> 42:18.474
being sick made me remember
my twin, like, unconsciously.

42:19.971 --> 42:21.838
She thinks
one grief

42:23.941 --> 42:25.909
can unlock another.

42:25.910 --> 42:28.812
Whatever that means.

42:28.813 --> 42:30.113
That's deep.

42:32.717 --> 42:35.152
I reckon she's read
one too many self-help books.

42:37.121 --> 42:38.889
I don't know.

42:41.192 --> 42:43.760
Now I know about it...

42:43.761 --> 42:46.663
I feel like I miss her.

42:46.664 --> 42:48.064
But, really, I've
always missed her,

42:50.668 --> 42:53.737
just never known it
was her that I missed.

42:58.209 --> 43:00.977
I don't like seeing you sad.

43:00.978 --> 43:02.946
I know.

43:11.088 --> 43:13.924
Oh, I hate the fog.
It's so spooky.

43:13.925 --> 43:15.692
Oh, scaredy-cat.

43:15.693 --> 43:17.627
Don't worry,
I'll protect you.

43:17.628 --> 43:19.896
Thanks, but I definitely
don't need protecting.

43:19.897 --> 43:21.765
Okay.

43:27.839 --> 43:29.806
You changed
your hair.

43:29.807 --> 43:31.708
What about it?

43:34.378 --> 43:37.347
I don't know. You look
like a different person.

43:37.348 --> 43:39.708
What, and you don't like me
looking like a different person?

43:43.988 --> 43:47.023
No.

43:49.093 --> 43:51.995
It's nice.

43:51.996 --> 43:54.264
Okay, well,
I've got to...

43:54.265 --> 43:56.867
Yeah.
Go now. So...

43:56.868 --> 43:59.369
Um, I'll see you tomorrow?

43:59.370 --> 44:01.071
Uh, yeah.
Great.
Cool.

44:01.339 --> 44:05.075
Night.

44:17.722 --> 44:18.722
I'm home.

44:19.690 --> 44:22.425
Dad?
Fay.

44:24.295 --> 44:25.829
Are you all right?

44:25.830 --> 44:27.364
I'm fine, I'm fine.

44:27.365 --> 44:29.366
What happened?
Oh, I...

44:29.367 --> 44:31.902
I must have fallen asleep
reading my book or something.

44:31.903 --> 44:33.737
I don't know.
Well, are you all right?

44:33.738 --> 44:35.772
I'm fine, I'm fine.
Don't you worry about me.

44:35.773 --> 44:36.773
That's it. Pull me up.

44:41.679 --> 44:43.747
You nearly gave me
a heart attack.

44:43.748 --> 44:45.982
You're too young
for a heart attack.

44:45.983 --> 44:47.951
Here you go.
Thank you.

44:57.028 --> 44:59.262
Fay.

44:59.263 --> 45:02.198
You don't want
to look at that.

45:02.199 --> 45:03.319
Oh, my God.
Put it down, Fay.

45:04.468 --> 45:06.736
Fay.

45:08.205 --> 45:10.173
My love.

45:10.174 --> 45:11.174
Fay.

45:12.143 --> 45:15.045
F...

46:05.496 --> 46:07.364
- Good morning, Miles.
- Good morning, Vincent.

46:07.365 --> 46:08.465
Behaving yourselves?

46:09.467 --> 46:12.535
I doubt it.

46:36.360 --> 46:39.095
Hey, just the girl
I wanted to see.
I'm late.

46:39.096 --> 46:41.097
Hey, listen,
I just wanted to say

46:41.098 --> 46:43.533
that I've stolen a few hours
from your English class

46:43.534 --> 46:45.268
for rehearsals.

46:45.269 --> 46:46.569
Hey! Come back.

46:47.872 --> 46:51.441
I waved at you this morning
in the playground.

46:53.911 --> 46:55.445
You just ignored me.

46:55.446 --> 46:57.981
Why didn't
you wave back at me?

46:57.982 --> 46:59.349
What's the problem?

46:59.350 --> 47:01.451
I came in
through the street entrance.

47:01.452 --> 47:04.587
I haven't been in the playground
this morning.

47:04.588 --> 47:08.591
Maybe it was, uh...
maybe it was Monica.

47:08.592 --> 47:11.094
I don't know. I just...
Look, I was out last night.

47:11.095 --> 47:13.463
Bit of a hangover.
Maybe it was just me.

47:13.464 --> 47:15.598
Take care, Fay.

47:15.599 --> 47:18.368
- "Look at me. I'm Fay.
- Please notice me.

47:20.838 --> 47:23.006
I'll do anything
to attract attention."

47:23.007 --> 47:24.607
You!

47:24.608 --> 47:26.976
It's been you all along,
you little bitch!

47:28.245 --> 47:30.413
You think you can mess
with my head?

47:30.414 --> 47:31.414
Fay!

47:31.415 --> 47:33.049
What are
you doing?

47:33.050 --> 47:35.218
Go on, Fay!

47:35.219 --> 47:36.286
You psycho!

47:36.287 --> 47:38.555
Stop, Fay.

47:38.556 --> 47:40.156
You mess with
me again,

47:40.157 --> 47:42.358
I swear I'll kill you!
Get off!

47:42.359 --> 47:43.960
Fay, please!

47:43.961 --> 47:45.161
Come on!

47:45.162 --> 47:46.529
Fay!
Fay, come on.
Calm down.

47:46.530 --> 47:48.098
What is going on?

47:48.099 --> 47:49.966
Relax.

47:49.967 --> 47:52.635
She's a psycho.

47:54.371 --> 47:56.106
Monica Meldrum
is impersonating me.

47:56.107 --> 47:58.174
She keeps pretending to be me.

47:58.175 --> 48:01.344
Why on earth would she go
to all that trouble?
I don't know.

48:01.345 --> 48:02.545
Because I got the main part

48:02.546 --> 48:04.447
in the school play
and she wanted it.

48:04.448 --> 48:08.084
I mean, she even said I only
got it because my dad's dying.

48:08.085 --> 48:09.986
Why would Monica
say something...

48:09.987 --> 48:12.188
Because she's insane.
It's not me.

48:12.189 --> 48:14.190
Don't you see? This
is what she wants.

48:14.191 --> 48:16.126
Okay, if she really is trying
to impersonate you,

48:16.127 --> 48:18.128
just ignore her
and she'll soon get tired of it.

48:18.129 --> 48:19.929
How can I
ignore her?

48:19.930 --> 48:22.065
This morning she came in through
the playground and a teacher

48:22.066 --> 48:23.466
actually mistook
her for me.

48:23.467 --> 48:25.135
Okay, Fay, I don't know
about anything else,

48:25.136 --> 48:27.036
but this morning she was not
in the playground

48:27.037 --> 48:28.304
pretending to be you.

48:28.305 --> 48:30.406
She got in early
through the street entrance

48:30.407 --> 48:33.009
for school council...
I can vouch for that myself.

48:33.010 --> 48:35.478
There's nothing I can do.
I have to call your parents.

48:43.220 --> 48:46.356
Well, at least from now on
you'll be able to tell us apart.

48:52.696 --> 48:54.964
I'm doing
what I can, but...

48:54.965 --> 48:56.966
it's a delicate area.

48:56.967 --> 48:58.368
You're gonna have
quite a scar.

48:58.369 --> 48:59.602
I hope so.

49:21.091 --> 49:22.731
Do you remember
when we used to come here?

49:23.561 --> 49:27.063
You always insisted
on a <i>Lion King</i> balloon.

49:29.466 --> 49:32.302
And then you'd hold on to it
for two minutes, and...

49:32.303 --> 49:35.572
you'd let
it go.

49:35.573 --> 49:39.309
I liked to see it fly away.

49:45.082 --> 49:48.618
I wish everything could just be
the way it was back then.

49:48.619 --> 49:49.619
You, me.

49:51.488 --> 49:53.456
Your dad.

49:55.459 --> 49:59.229
I'd do anything
for you, Fay.

50:01.565 --> 50:03.032
Anything.

50:03.033 --> 50:04.767
I would.

50:04.768 --> 50:06.302
I really would.

50:06.303 --> 50:08.471
Stop seeing my...
Stop seeing him, then.

50:08.472 --> 50:10.473
What?
Don't deny it, please.

50:10.474 --> 50:13.109
I don't know
what you...
Is that why I got the main part?

50:13.110 --> 50:14.177
No!

50:16.013 --> 50:18.248
No, no, of course not.

50:18.249 --> 50:19.716
How could you, Mum?
No.

50:19.717 --> 50:22.252
I'm-I'm so sorry.

50:22.253 --> 50:24.387
I didn't mean for it
to happen. I just...

50:24.388 --> 50:25.788
You-you just couldn't help
yourself?

50:25.789 --> 50:27.323
It's been a...
been a difficult...

50:27.324 --> 50:30.126
Couldn't you have waited?

50:36.166 --> 50:38.434
I'm sorry.

50:38.435 --> 50:40.236
Life's not always as...

50:40.237 --> 50:42.672
simple as you
want it to be.

50:42.673 --> 50:45.441
It's as simple as you make it.

50:52.283 --> 50:53.783
All right,
I'll end it.

50:53.784 --> 50:55.752
I promise.

51:05.229 --> 51:06.362
Fay?

51:06.363 --> 51:07.563
Yeah?

51:07.565 --> 51:08.631
Darling, Drew's here.

51:10.167 --> 51:11.701
He's come to
say hello.

51:11.702 --> 51:13.469
Oh. Um...

51:13.470 --> 51:15.705
Yeah, no, send him in.

51:22.813 --> 51:24.647
Hi.

51:24.648 --> 51:27.250
Hi.

51:27.251 --> 51:29.452
I, um...

51:29.453 --> 51:31.254
I wanted to see
if you're all right.

51:31.255 --> 51:34.223
Oh. Yeah. Fine.

51:40.831 --> 51:42.565
Did you
take these?

51:42.566 --> 51:43.666
Yeah.

51:43.667 --> 51:46.169
That's really cool.

51:53.677 --> 51:54.917
God, is that you and your twin?

51:55.646 --> 51:58.481
It's really
beautiful.

52:08.425 --> 52:10.259
So, does it hurt?

52:10.260 --> 52:11.461
Oh, not much.

52:13.430 --> 52:15.898
Everyone thinks I'm crazy,
right?

52:18.702 --> 52:21.270
No. No, not at all.

52:21.271 --> 52:23.539
In fact, actually, I think they
were planning on giving you

52:23.540 --> 52:25.808
the Most Uncrazy Teen
of the Year award.

52:30.180 --> 52:33.649
I don't know. Maybe I am.

52:33.650 --> 52:35.785
I don't know
what to believe anymore.

52:35.786 --> 52:38.254
It turns out
it wasn't Monica after all.

52:38.255 --> 52:41.257
Yeah, I heard you were
quite impressive.

52:41.258 --> 52:43.159
Let me know next time,
and I'll sell tickets.

52:43.160 --> 52:44.327
We could make
a fortune.

54:39.910 --> 54:42.345
Okay, ready? When we
get to there, we race.

54:42.346 --> 54:45.882
Okay.

54:45.883 --> 54:49.485
I'm so slow.

54:49.486 --> 54:52.555
"Well, she said, 'Yes, '
we said, 'I do.'"

54:52.556 --> 54:54.323
That's so cringe.

54:54.324 --> 54:55.858
I think that means
they got married.

54:55.859 --> 54:57.326
Really?
Yeah.

54:57.327 --> 55:00.396
Oh, I think so.
Well done. Well done, Drew.

55:00.397 --> 55:04.033
"Marjorie and Joe Lodge,
who loved the pier and the sea."

55:48.111 --> 55:51.047
There.

55:51.048 --> 55:53.015
It's okay, my love.

55:53.016 --> 55:55.384
My girl.

55:58.622 --> 56:00.690
My darling.

56:00.691 --> 56:02.658
Oh.

56:02.659 --> 56:04.860
It's okay.

56:07.564 --> 56:09.999
Baskin-Robbins once made
a ketchup-flavored ice cream.

56:13.704 --> 56:15.104
Ugh.
Ugh.

56:15.105 --> 56:17.073
Oh, that's
just vile.

56:17.074 --> 56:19.542
They've got shrimp-flavored
ice cream in Japan.

56:21.478 --> 56:22.645
Oh.
Mmm.

56:22.646 --> 56:23.879
Mm-hmm. And seaweed.

56:23.880 --> 56:25.481
Horrible.

56:25.482 --> 56:27.483
Horrible.

56:34.591 --> 56:37.026
Well, we should get our acts
together in about five minutes.

56:37.027 --> 56:38.861
Hmm?

58:04.981 --> 58:06.949
It's okay.

01:00:09.973 --> 01:00:11.674
Come here.

01:00:23.186 --> 01:00:25.154
Get a room.

01:00:34.397 --> 01:00:36.932
That doesn't
look too pretty.

01:00:36.933 --> 01:00:38.901
I'm-I'm sure that's...

01:00:43.073 --> 01:00:44.406
Excuse me.

01:00:44.407 --> 01:00:46.408
I think I know this car.

01:00:46.409 --> 01:00:47.843
What's going on, Fay?

01:00:47.844 --> 01:00:49.144
Can I help you?

01:00:49.145 --> 01:00:50.412
It's Moffat's car.
What?

01:00:50.413 --> 01:00:51.714
You know
John Moffat?

01:00:51.715 --> 01:00:53.015
He's our
drama teacher.

01:00:53.016 --> 01:00:54.884
Is he...
Oh, it's a nasty accident.

01:00:54.885 --> 01:00:56.819
He's in theater at
ICU, St. Bernard's.

01:00:56.820 --> 01:00:58.187
What happened?

01:00:58.188 --> 01:00:59.822
There was a girl in
the road, apparently.

01:00:59.823 --> 01:01:01.257
She threw a stone
through the windscreen,

01:01:01.258 --> 01:01:02.825
and the driver swerved
into the tree.

01:01:02.826 --> 01:01:05.728
But there's been
no sign of anyone.

01:01:05.729 --> 01:01:08.664
We can't find the girl
who did it anywhere.
Shit.

01:01:08.665 --> 01:01:10.099
There was another
passenger in the car.

01:01:10.100 --> 01:01:11.934
Uh, a woman.

01:01:11.935 --> 01:01:14.803
The paramedics, they sent her
home with barely a scratch.

01:01:23.446 --> 01:01:24.914
Fay, what's going on?

01:01:24.915 --> 01:01:26.248
My twin did this.

01:01:26.249 --> 01:01:28.209
She knew. She knew before
I did Mum didn't end it.

01:01:31.321 --> 01:01:33.088
Fay, what are you talking about?

01:01:33.089 --> 01:01:35.169
What if this other person
is like an extension of me?

01:01:38.261 --> 01:01:39.895
I'm sorry, I've got to go.

01:02:03.186 --> 01:02:06.088
Mum?

01:02:06.089 --> 01:02:08.090
I've got
a migraine, love.

01:02:08.091 --> 01:02:11.327
I'm gonna
sleep it off.

01:02:11.328 --> 01:02:13.295
Okay.

01:02:29.980 --> 01:02:32.114
Okay, love,
I'm off to work.

01:02:32.115 --> 01:02:34.316
Mum?

01:02:34.317 --> 01:02:36.051
Yeah?

01:02:36.052 --> 01:02:38.020
Mum.

01:02:43.927 --> 01:02:45.995
Are you okay?

01:02:45.996 --> 01:02:49.098
Mm-hmm.

01:02:49.099 --> 01:02:50.499
You not getting ready
for school?

01:02:50.500 --> 01:02:53.168
Oh, I'm not feeling too good.

01:02:53.169 --> 01:02:54.209
Could you call me in sick?

01:02:55.338 --> 01:02:57.906
Sure. I'll see you tonight.

01:04:57.393 --> 01:05:00.996
So, we'll pick up where
we left off yesterday, shall we?

01:05:00.997 --> 01:05:02.431
That would be
act one, scene six.

01:05:02.432 --> 01:05:04.199
If you remember,
they had just

01:05:04.200 --> 01:05:06.001
arrived at
Macbeth's castle.
Thanks for the photo.

01:05:06.002 --> 01:05:08.403
I don't know how you did it,
but you look really hot.

01:05:08.404 --> 01:05:09.404
So, please,
Banquo, Macbeth...

01:05:09.405 --> 01:05:11.206
The photo you put in my locker?

01:05:11.207 --> 01:05:13.008
Lady Macbeth
and Duncan.

01:05:18.281 --> 01:05:21.950
Macbeth and Lady Macbeth,
any time today, thank you.

01:05:27.056 --> 01:05:30.425
So, the top of page 36.

01:05:30.426 --> 01:05:33.395
And, Fay, if you
can do the couplets

01:05:33.396 --> 01:05:36.165
with the rhythm you had
yesterday, that was brilliant.

01:05:36.166 --> 01:05:37.432
You mean Monica?

01:05:37.433 --> 01:05:39.401
I wasn't here yesterday.

01:05:39.402 --> 01:05:41.436
I was sick.

01:05:43.506 --> 01:05:45.407
My mum called me in sick.

01:05:45.408 --> 01:05:48.210
Yes, we did get the call,
but no, you were here.

01:05:48.211 --> 01:05:50.479
We did the whole
of act one?

01:05:50.480 --> 01:05:52.381
I was off sick.

01:05:52.382 --> 01:05:55.150
Fay, I-I've really tried
to be patient with you,

01:05:55.151 --> 01:05:57.286
but I've really had enough
with your dramatics.

01:05:57.287 --> 01:05:58.453
I wasn't here yesterday!

01:05:58.454 --> 01:06:00.255
Give it up, Fay.

01:06:00.256 --> 01:06:01.657
We were all
here yesterday.

01:06:01.658 --> 01:06:03.392
We all saw you.

01:06:03.393 --> 01:06:05.394
Yeah, exactly.
We all saw you.

01:06:05.395 --> 01:06:07.296
Yeah, thank you, ladies.

01:06:07.297 --> 01:06:10.032
Now, please go onstage.

01:06:10.033 --> 01:06:11.600
Fay? Fay?

01:06:11.601 --> 01:06:13.435
Psycho.
Fay!

01:06:25.548 --> 01:06:27.649
Yeah, that's her.

01:06:30.553 --> 01:06:33.155
Hey, baby, you want to pick up
where we left off yesterday?

01:06:33.156 --> 01:06:34.690
Get off!
Oh, you weren't
saying that yesterday.

01:06:34.691 --> 01:06:37.693
Get your filthy
hands off me!
Oh, shit!

01:06:51.074 --> 01:06:53.508
Hey. Hey, hey, hey,
hey, hey, hey, hey.

01:06:53.509 --> 01:06:55.410
What's wrong,
darling?

01:06:55.411 --> 01:06:57.112
What's wrong?

01:06:57.113 --> 01:06:59.114
I'm losing my mind.
I'm going mad.

01:06:59.115 --> 01:07:01.083
You're not. You're
not losing your mind.

01:07:01.084 --> 01:07:03.452
I am! I am!
You don't understand! I am!

01:07:03.453 --> 01:07:05.220
Shh! Stop it, now.

01:07:05.221 --> 01:07:07.022
Stop it. You
listen to me.

01:07:07.023 --> 01:07:11.126
You are not losing
your mind, okay?

01:07:11.127 --> 01:07:13.128
You're right.

01:07:15.131 --> 01:07:16.611
What you think you
see, you're seeing.

01:07:17.500 --> 01:07:20.168
It's Layla.

01:07:22.138 --> 01:07:25.374
<i>I see her, too.</i>

01:07:27.677 --> 01:07:30.345
<i>I've always seen her.</i>

01:07:30.346 --> 01:07:32.781
How can it be?

01:07:32.782 --> 01:07:35.417
Oh, my love.

01:07:35.418 --> 01:07:38.287
<i>Your mother was found
in the Whitecross Underpass,</i>

01:07:40.657 --> 01:07:42.624
<i>unconscious.</i>

01:07:47.697 --> 01:07:48.697
<i>Bleeding.</i>

01:07:49.666 --> 01:07:52.834
<i>Placental abruption.</i>

01:07:56.839 --> 01:07:58.573
<i>Common enough, apparently,
but they should have</i>

01:07:58.574 --> 01:07:59.614
<i>picked it up in the scans.</i>

01:08:00.677 --> 01:08:02.778
I...

01:08:04.847 --> 01:08:07.716
went straight from
work to the hospital,

01:08:07.717 --> 01:08:10.252
and she was already
in the theater.

01:08:12.655 --> 01:08:14.375
<i>They told me only one
of you would survive.</i>

01:08:16.158 --> 01:08:18.493
<i>And they had to operate
immediately, and then...</i>

01:08:22.432 --> 01:08:25.500
Then I had to sign...

01:08:27.502 --> 01:08:29.203
<i>...the papers
giving them permission</i>

01:08:31.240 --> 01:08:33.408
<i>to let one of you go.</i>

01:08:33.408 --> 01:08:34.843
<i>They told me,
if I didn't sign,</i>

01:08:36.613 --> 01:08:37.813
<i>I could lose
all three of you.</i>

01:08:38.581 --> 01:08:42.350
<i>And, of course, I signed.</i>

01:08:44.319 --> 01:08:46.621
It felt like a
viable trade.

01:08:49.192 --> 01:08:51.393
One life to save
another and...

01:08:54.330 --> 01:08:56.631
and Ann's.

01:09:05.207 --> 01:09:08.343
<i>She was so beautiful.</i>

01:09:10.546 --> 01:09:13.381
Like you.

01:09:16.719 --> 01:09:17.719
Just like you.

01:09:19.689 --> 01:09:21.790
<i>The most perfect thing
I'd ever seen.</i>

01:09:24.661 --> 01:09:27.595
<i>Except that she was dead.</i>

01:09:36.439 --> 01:09:38.674
I never told your mum

01:09:38.675 --> 01:09:41.643
<i>that I'd signed
her execution papers.</i>

01:09:41.644 --> 01:09:42.644
<i>I couldn't tell her that.</i>

01:09:44.613 --> 01:09:47.515
<i>It was a guilt
I had to bear on my own.</i>

01:09:50.286 --> 01:09:52.254
Dad.

01:09:52.255 --> 01:09:53.388
And...

01:09:55.358 --> 01:09:58.226
...she's still here.

01:10:07.336 --> 01:10:09.371
<i>My ghost daughter.</i>

01:10:09.372 --> 01:10:11.807
With me.

01:10:11.808 --> 01:10:13.575
<i>Calling in her debt from me.</i>

01:10:16.312 --> 01:10:18.447
At first, I thought

01:10:18.448 --> 01:10:20.348
that only I could see
her, but I was wrong.

01:10:22.318 --> 01:10:24.653
She's always
been here,

01:10:27.590 --> 01:10:29.658
<i>in the shadows.</i>

01:10:29.659 --> 01:10:31.693
As real as any
ghost can be.

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:40.268
<i>And where is she now?</i>

01:10:40.269 --> 01:10:42.003
No.
Dad, I want to see her.

01:10:42.004 --> 01:10:43.939
You mustn't see her.
It's dangerous.

01:10:43.940 --> 01:10:45.707
You don't understand. Fay!

01:10:45.708 --> 01:10:47.642
She's me!
I want to see her!

01:10:47.643 --> 01:10:48.744
You mustn't see her!

01:10:48.745 --> 01:10:50.746
I'm not enough
for her anymore.

01:10:50.747 --> 01:10:51.880
<i>She wants</i>

01:10:51.881 --> 01:10:53.281
your life!

01:10:53.282 --> 01:10:54.783
Don't you understand?!

01:10:54.784 --> 01:10:57.018
<i>You mustn't look at her, Fay.</i>

01:10:57.019 --> 01:10:59.721
If you don't look at her,
she can't hurt you.

01:10:59.722 --> 01:11:01.556
It's the only way
she can get you.

01:11:01.557 --> 01:11:03.525
<i>Promise me, Fay.</i>

01:11:03.526 --> 01:11:04.826
I know.

01:11:05.962 --> 01:11:08.697
I can stop her, Dad.

01:11:08.698 --> 01:11:10.632
I know where she'll be.

01:11:10.633 --> 01:11:11.800
Fay! Fay!

01:11:13.636 --> 01:11:15.837
Fay, wait!

01:11:32.722 --> 01:11:34.689
I'm here.

01:11:34.690 --> 01:11:35.724
I'm here.

01:11:37.727 --> 01:11:38.727
I know you're here, too.

01:11:39.829 --> 01:11:42.631
I'm sorry you died and I lived.

01:11:44.600 --> 01:11:45.734
I wish you lived, too.

01:11:48.538 --> 01:11:49.858
But you have
to stop punishing us.

01:11:52.642 --> 01:11:54.009
It wasn't Dad's fault.

01:11:55.978 --> 01:11:58.980
Where are you?

01:12:00.950 --> 01:12:01.950
Look at me, Fay.

01:12:02.885 --> 01:12:05.820
Go on, look at me.

01:12:10.359 --> 01:12:12.961
I know you can't resist.

01:12:14.964 --> 01:12:17.966
You have to leave
us alone, Layla.

01:12:17.967 --> 01:12:20.735
Never.

01:12:26.108 --> 01:12:27.388
Look at me, Fay.
Look at me, Fay.

01:12:29.345 --> 01:12:30.912
Look at me.

01:13:01.143 --> 01:13:03.712
- He was in such a hurry.
- He didn't want to wait,

01:13:03.713 --> 01:13:05.046
and, of course,
he couldn't take the stairs.

01:13:05.047 --> 01:13:06.715
I tried to tell him

01:13:06.716 --> 01:13:08.516
the lift is broken,
but he wouldn't listen.

01:13:08.517 --> 01:13:10.619
No? Okay.
I tried to tell him
to take the even lift.

01:13:10.620 --> 01:13:12.621
That one works.
That one has always worked.

01:13:12.622 --> 01:13:14.956
I told that lazy landlord
a thousand times.

01:13:14.957 --> 01:13:17.726
I knew that lift
would kill someone one day.

01:13:17.727 --> 01:13:19.694
That landlord
is a murderer!

01:13:38.414 --> 01:13:39.881
<i>Fay!</i>

01:13:41.517 --> 01:13:42.517
<i>Fay, wait! Wait for me!</i>

01:13:46.022 --> 01:13:48.089
<i>Fay!</i>

01:14:11.213 --> 01:14:12.847
Hey.

01:14:12.848 --> 01:14:15.116
Hey.

01:14:15.117 --> 01:14:17.218
You all right?

01:14:17.219 --> 01:14:18.553
Yeah, I'm good.

01:14:19.188 --> 01:14:22.624
I'm sorry...

01:14:24.727 --> 01:14:26.528
about not being
there for you.

01:14:26.529 --> 01:14:28.563
Look, forget about it.

01:14:28.564 --> 01:14:30.724
My head was totally mashed
with my dad and stuff, so...

01:14:31.667 --> 01:14:32.967
Of course.

01:14:35.871 --> 01:14:37.839
I'm sorry anyway.

01:15:26.722 --> 01:15:28.823
See you in the wings.
See you in the wings.

01:16:10.332 --> 01:16:13.234
Your father would
be so proud of you.

01:16:13.235 --> 01:16:15.203
Are you ready?

01:16:23.212 --> 01:16:24.212
I'm ready.

01:16:25.181 --> 01:16:27.916
<i>You will disappear,</i>

01:16:29.919 --> 01:16:32.320
<i>and no one will know it.</i>
