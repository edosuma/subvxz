WEBVTT

00:03.177 --> 00:05.396
Remember that kid that came in
the other day,

00:05.440 --> 00:07.050
wanting to
report a crime?

00:07.094 --> 00:08.138
He didn't happen to sign in
or anything, did he?

00:08.182 --> 00:09.183
Bridger Ryan.

00:10.271 --> 00:11.837
Come here.

00:11.881 --> 00:13.056
Bridger is gone.

00:13.100 --> 00:14.057
I'm worried something bad
happened to him.

00:15.754 --> 00:16.929
You have something that does not
belong to you,

00:16.973 --> 00:18.279
<i>and I have your brother.</i>

00:18.322 --> 00:19.628
I'd like to make
a trade.

00:19.671 --> 00:21.673
<i>The bags from the wreck --
bring 'em.</i>

00:21.717 --> 00:23.284
You have one hour.

00:23.327 --> 00:24.459
You sure you don't want me to
take care of Harvey?

00:24.502 --> 00:26.069
Nah, it's better I do it.

00:26.113 --> 00:27.679
No one gets up this road.

00:27.723 --> 00:29.638
Madi, you go around back
and try to stall him.

00:29.681 --> 00:30.987
Max and I will look
for Bridger

00:31.031 --> 00:32.206
and then try to create
a diversion.

00:32.249 --> 00:33.250
Okay.

00:33.294 --> 00:35.687
Let's go.

00:35.731 --> 00:37.689
Figure out what you're gonna say
to Harvey when you see him?

00:37.733 --> 00:39.126
Augh!

00:44.827 --> 00:46.350
Took you long enough.

00:46.394 --> 00:48.135
Where is it?

00:48.178 --> 00:49.875
My brother, now.

00:49.919 --> 00:51.355
Just get in here.

00:56.404 --> 00:57.709
Oh, my God!
Bridger, are you okay?

00:57.753 --> 00:59.015
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.

01:01.191 --> 01:03.541
You need to take the tape off
his mouth. He has asthma.

01:03.585 --> 01:05.674
Oh, poor little baby.

01:05.717 --> 01:09.199
All his jibber-jabber
was givin' me a headache!

01:09.243 --> 01:12.376
If you take it off, I'll tell
you where the bags are.

01:15.292 --> 01:16.946
Ah!
Don't tell him anything!

01:16.989 --> 01:19.470
Shut up!
Go on.

01:19.514 --> 01:20.993
I-I left them out
in the woods.

01:21.037 --> 01:23.561
I can lead you to them.

01:23.605 --> 01:25.911
You better not be lying.

01:27.391 --> 01:28.523
Your life
depends on it.

01:28.566 --> 01:29.915
Hey!
Back off!

01:29.959 --> 01:31.265
His, too.

01:34.050 --> 01:35.356
Please.

01:35.399 --> 01:37.358
You got that?

01:37.401 --> 01:39.142
Come on. Let's go.

01:42.363 --> 01:43.712
Don't go anywhere.

01:48.586 --> 01:49.848
So, where are
the bags at?

01:49.892 --> 01:51.067
They're around back.

01:51.111 --> 01:52.460
Alright, hurry up.

01:53.678 --> 01:55.637
Okay, okay, come on.
Let's go. Quick.

01:58.248 --> 01:59.510
Go on.
Ohh!

01:59.554 --> 02:01.208
Oh, my God,
What do we do?

02:01.251 --> 02:03.210
I-I'm gonna go follow them
and make sure nothing happens.

02:03.253 --> 02:05.168
You go get Bridger.

02:12.044 --> 02:13.307
Ohh!

02:15.700 --> 02:17.006
Where is it?

02:20.879 --> 02:22.185
Ah!

02:23.273 --> 02:25.449
You okay?
Been better.

02:39.289 --> 02:41.465
Who is that?
Who tipped off Harvey?

02:41.509 --> 02:43.815
The moment Tonya got away,
he knew his number was punched.

02:46.383 --> 02:49.038
Damn it.
I have to call in backup.

02:56.132 --> 02:58.221
Max! Hurry up.
He got Madison.

02:58.265 --> 02:59.483
Harper's on it.

03:01.093 --> 03:02.965
Get the knife.
It's over in the kitchen.

03:04.358 --> 03:06.229
I'm gonna kill
that son of a bitch.

03:08.971 --> 03:10.277
Max, really?
Come on.

03:10.320 --> 03:11.495
It's not cutting.

03:16.544 --> 03:18.459
Hurry!
Get me the hell out of here!

03:23.551 --> 03:25.292
Deputy?

03:29.513 --> 03:31.515
Your door's open!

03:41.090 --> 03:43.527
Anybody home?

04:08.160 --> 04:10.206
Wait. That's the woman
from the river.

04:10.250 --> 04:11.686
What?
From the crime scene,

04:11.729 --> 04:13.383
where they were taking the dead
bodies out of the river.

04:13.427 --> 04:15.080
She was there.
She was watching.

04:15.124 --> 04:16.125
She was freakin' weird,
man.

04:16.168 --> 04:17.561
You know what this means?

04:17.605 --> 04:18.562
Harvey's not the only one
who knows

04:18.606 --> 04:19.911
we have the money
and the drugs.

04:19.955 --> 04:21.957
I don't care
about that right now. Okay?

04:22.000 --> 04:23.219
We just gotta find Madison

04:23.263 --> 04:24.655
before something terrible
happens.

04:32.837 --> 04:34.317
<i>Yeah?</i>

04:34.361 --> 04:35.536
Something very strange
is going on here, Donno.

04:35.579 --> 04:36.667
I need you
at the house.

04:36.711 --> 04:37.973
It's not a good time
for me.

04:38.016 --> 04:39.366
Company?
Yeah.

04:39.409 --> 04:41.106
Well, handle it
and get over here.

04:41.150 --> 04:42.238
<i>We've got to wrap this up
quick.</i>

04:42.282 --> 04:44.109
Okay.

04:44.153 --> 04:45.894
Come on.

04:49.071 --> 04:52.117
Getting real tired
of our little nature walk.

04:57.601 --> 05:00.125
You sure we ain't lost?
Huh?

05:00.169 --> 05:02.389
No.
It's just up here.

05:03.651 --> 05:05.740
Okay. Hey, careful.

05:05.783 --> 05:07.394
He could be waiting
for us to jump cover.

05:07.437 --> 05:08.351
We can't just sit here.

05:08.395 --> 05:09.352
Look, I wear
the badge now.

05:09.396 --> 05:10.832
I have to follow protocol.

05:10.875 --> 05:12.834
Jenny, if he's gone,
wherever he's headed,

05:12.877 --> 05:14.401
we're giving him
a big lead.

05:14.444 --> 05:15.706
Okay, I go first.
Cover me.

05:15.750 --> 05:17.447
Wait, no.
You took a bullet for me once.

05:17.491 --> 05:18.796
I'm not gonna
let that happen again.

05:18.840 --> 05:20.363
I go first.

05:21.538 --> 05:22.844
Be my guest.

05:24.062 --> 05:26.021
I'm going.
No, wait.

05:26.064 --> 05:27.457
She's still
in the house.

05:29.503 --> 05:31.243
That's my sister.
Come on.

05:56.225 --> 05:57.748
Isn't that something?

06:06.061 --> 06:07.541
Shell casings.

06:07.584 --> 06:09.064
Good eye.

06:11.458 --> 06:14.548
It's a lotta ground to cover.
He could be anywhere.

06:14.591 --> 06:15.810
Let's work
our way up slow.

06:20.684 --> 06:23.687
Harvey's cruiser and phone
were at the house.

06:23.731 --> 06:25.472
He has to be
close by.

06:25.515 --> 06:26.864
Did you move our car?

06:26.908 --> 06:29.171
Yeah, it's on
a back road.

06:30.390 --> 06:32.696
Okay, what happens when we bump
into that woman in the woods?

06:32.740 --> 06:34.045
We just hope we can run faster
than she does.

06:35.307 --> 06:36.483
Madi.

06:36.526 --> 06:37.571
They went that way.

06:37.614 --> 06:39.050
Hurry.

06:40.487 --> 06:41.575
I'm not a liar!

06:41.618 --> 06:43.272
Then what
was your plan, huh --

06:43.315 --> 06:45.535
lure me out here and wait
for the cops to come?

06:45.579 --> 06:49.496
Last chance --
where are the bags?

06:55.632 --> 06:56.807
Son of a bitch.

06:59.506 --> 07:02.030
Which direction
did it come from?

07:02.073 --> 07:03.597
No idea.

07:09.124 --> 07:10.081
Over there.

07:10.125 --> 07:11.431
Okay, come on.

07:12.127 --> 07:13.476
Next time, I won't miss!

07:34.454 --> 07:36.717
Time's up.

07:36.760 --> 07:38.283
Hey!

07:39.546 --> 07:40.547
Who the hell are you?

07:40.590 --> 07:42.505
- Let her go!
- Drop the bag.

07:42.549 --> 07:43.941
If you want the other bag,
let her go.

07:43.985 --> 07:46.117
Not lacking in the confidence
department, I see.

07:46.161 --> 07:48.511
Drop the bag,
or you die!

07:51.122 --> 07:53.647
Madison, hey!
Madi, Madi, hey.

07:53.690 --> 07:54.735
Let's get the hell
out of here! Come on!

07:55.779 --> 07:57.477
Enough!

08:05.485 --> 08:06.747
Who the hell are you?!

08:34.078 --> 08:35.602
Run!

08:38.996 --> 08:40.824
Come on, Harper!
Let's go! Come on!

09:04.500 --> 09:06.763
Check the surrounding area!
Find Jenny Hoyt!

09:06.807 --> 09:08.460
Yes, sir!

09:08.504 --> 09:10.724
Set up a perimeter...

09:12.682 --> 09:13.640
Damn it.

09:15.337 --> 09:17.078
Looks like someone
beat us to the punch.

09:17.121 --> 09:18.253
Who?

09:18.296 --> 09:19.863
Good question, Donno.

09:22.866 --> 09:25.173
This works for us.
Little messier than I'd like,

09:25.216 --> 09:27.088
but it's not our mess.
Mm.

09:30.221 --> 09:31.788
We got to go, right now.

09:41.450 --> 09:43.539
Why is State taking over
Harvey's case?

09:43.583 --> 09:44.888
We haven't given it
a proper investigation.

09:44.932 --> 09:46.237
Funny way to say hello.

09:46.281 --> 09:48.065
It's too soon to punt
the football,

09:48.109 --> 09:49.893
and I feel I'm close.

09:49.937 --> 09:51.895
Let's say Harvey did murder
Big Sam and Ringo.

09:51.939 --> 09:53.767
Crime of opportunity,
right?

09:53.810 --> 09:56.857
But why kidnap Tonya?
It doesn't make sense.

09:56.900 --> 09:58.032
Not now, Jenny.

09:58.075 --> 09:59.642
Hey, Harvey wasn't
working alone.

09:59.686 --> 10:01.775
The bullet casings we found
didn't trace back

10:01.818 --> 10:03.211
to any of
his registered guns,

10:03.254 --> 10:04.342
and someone else
was at the house --

10:04.386 --> 10:05.779
maybe more than one person.

10:05.822 --> 10:06.823
Unless you've got names
or something concrete,

10:06.867 --> 10:08.477
it's out of my hands.

10:08.520 --> 10:10.305
I'll get you a name if you
give me time to do my job.

10:10.348 --> 10:12.089
- I can't.
- You can, but you won't,

10:12.133 --> 10:13.656
and I don't
understand why.

10:13.700 --> 10:14.701
Inside, now.

10:19.357 --> 10:21.055
How dare you barge in here
and make any kind of judgment

10:21.098 --> 10:22.665
after the stunt
you pulled.

10:22.709 --> 10:24.058
You are starting to become
a liability, Jenny.

10:24.101 --> 10:25.886
One more misstep,
I'll suspend you.

10:25.929 --> 10:27.757
I don't get
what's going on here.

10:27.801 --> 10:29.019
I know you're flirting
with retirement,

10:29.063 --> 10:31.456
but I've never known you
to be a lazy cop,

10:31.500 --> 10:32.719
and punting
this case is lazy.

10:32.762 --> 10:34.546
I didn't have a choice!

10:34.590 --> 10:35.678
Harvey's one of my own.

10:35.722 --> 10:37.854
Everything he did,
he did under my nose.

10:37.898 --> 10:39.900
It's a conflict of interest.

10:39.943 --> 10:41.902
I can't be impartial
when my own job is on the line.

10:41.945 --> 10:43.643
I --
But I can!

10:46.080 --> 10:47.777
You know how
this is gonna go?

10:47.821 --> 10:50.519
This case is gonna get boxed up
and go cold.

10:50.562 --> 10:53.740
If I'm right -- if Harvey was
working for the cartel --

10:53.783 --> 10:56.568
Tonya and possibly others
are still in danger.

10:56.612 --> 10:58.832
If you're right,
the State investigators

10:58.875 --> 11:00.050
will find something.

11:00.094 --> 11:02.792
Until then,
you stand down.

11:02.836 --> 11:03.880
Do you understand?

11:03.924 --> 11:06.143
No. I don't.

11:06.187 --> 11:08.972
But you're the boss.

11:19.940 --> 11:21.332
<i>Hey, this is Travis.</i>

11:21.376 --> 11:22.551
<i>Leave a message.</i>

11:22.594 --> 11:24.335
Where have you been?
Call me back.

11:30.907 --> 11:32.343
Hey, what's up?

11:32.387 --> 11:33.823
You got that look.

11:35.607 --> 11:36.870
The more I think about
Tonya's story,

11:36.913 --> 11:38.219
the more questions
I have.

11:38.262 --> 11:40.438
Yeah, I wasn't gonna say
anything,

11:40.482 --> 11:42.136
but there was something weird
about her energy

11:42.179 --> 11:43.659
when she walked in here.

11:43.703 --> 11:44.747
I've been trying to
get ahold of her,

11:44.791 --> 11:45.879
but her phone's still off.

11:45.922 --> 11:46.793
I should stop by
her house.

11:46.836 --> 11:48.577
I stopped by
this morning.

11:48.620 --> 11:50.535
The building manager said
she's staying with a friend.

11:50.579 --> 11:51.885
At least we know
she's somewhere safe.

11:51.928 --> 11:54.583
Let's keep trying to
get ahold of her.

11:56.367 --> 11:59.153
Hi. I'm Denise.
How can I help you?

11:59.196 --> 12:02.156
Yeah, I'm, uh -- I'm --
I'm looking for Jerrie Kennedy?

12:02.199 --> 12:03.810
Oh, she's...

12:05.725 --> 12:08.597
My goodness.

12:08.640 --> 12:09.598
It's really you.

12:12.166 --> 12:13.341
Jerrie, who is this?

12:13.384 --> 12:14.646
Nobody.

12:14.690 --> 12:16.779
C'mon, don't say that.

12:16.823 --> 12:20.348
I'm, uh -- I-I'm --

12:20.391 --> 12:22.132
He used to be my father.

12:30.967 --> 12:33.187
Insecure much?

12:38.627 --> 12:40.847
I dropped a pin
to my sister.
Which means...?

12:40.890 --> 12:42.849
If you kill me,
she'll know.

12:42.892 --> 12:43.980
Why would we do that?

12:45.068 --> 12:46.678
Oh, no. He's fine.

12:46.722 --> 12:48.463
I'm <i>not</i> fine.
I have an infection

12:48.506 --> 12:51.422
where you stabbed me
in my favorite leg.

12:51.466 --> 12:52.815
My sister's a nurse.

12:52.859 --> 12:54.208
You want,
I can have her take a look.

12:54.251 --> 12:56.079
Tonya...

12:56.123 --> 12:57.951
You should be
long gone by now.

12:57.994 --> 13:00.083
What happens if
I don't want to leave town?

13:00.127 --> 13:01.955
Donno happens.
He kills your whole family.

13:01.998 --> 13:04.958
Your whole family.
All of them.

13:05.001 --> 13:08.048
I mean, what if
I stayed to work for you?

13:11.486 --> 13:13.096
What could you
possibly do for us?

13:13.140 --> 13:15.925
Relax. Did Sam tell you
what we do?

13:15.969 --> 13:19.276
I can guess, and if I'm right,
you invest your profit

13:19.320 --> 13:21.104
from drugs into
legitimate businesses

13:21.148 --> 13:24.194
like this
development company.

13:24.238 --> 13:27.241
People around here are
distrusting of outsiders.

13:27.284 --> 13:29.460
You need a local on your team
if you want your business

13:29.504 --> 13:30.766
to be successful.

13:30.810 --> 13:31.854
Why should we trust you?

13:31.898 --> 13:34.204
I've proven myself,
haven't I?

13:34.248 --> 13:36.424
G-- I-I made the police believe
that Deputy Harvey

13:36.467 --> 13:38.295
was responsible
for kidnapping me.

13:38.339 --> 13:41.081
He went down for everything,
just like you wanted.

13:41.124 --> 13:43.039
I saw the type of money
that Sam was making.

13:43.083 --> 13:44.911
I-I can't be
a waitress forever.

13:44.954 --> 13:46.434
I want more for my life.

13:48.479 --> 13:49.872
I told you she had spunk.

13:49.916 --> 13:50.873
Ren...

13:54.050 --> 13:56.270
I love when a woman advocates
for herself.

13:56.313 --> 13:58.141
And come to think of it,

13:58.185 --> 14:01.057
there is something that maybe
we can do with you.

14:08.804 --> 14:10.153
Hmm.

14:11.328 --> 14:13.896
I'm not going to let you
hypnotize me.

14:13.940 --> 14:17.247
Truth be told, hypnotism is
a very common state of mind --

14:17.291 --> 14:21.164
advertising, television, the
black hole of your cellphone.

14:21.208 --> 14:23.514
Sounds like a bunch of
hocus-pocus to me.

14:23.558 --> 14:27.127
Well, you're closer to
your sugar soup.

14:27.170 --> 14:28.519
Remember that.

14:39.139 --> 14:40.575
What's happening to me?

14:40.618 --> 14:43.752
Uh, Agatha...

14:43.795 --> 14:46.189
gave you
some of her special tea.

14:46.233 --> 14:48.757
Truth be told, I don't know
the first thing about hypnotism.

14:48.800 --> 14:50.367
I'm not a therapist.
I'm an animal trainer.

14:50.411 --> 14:54.719
But I thought the tea would
help you along a little bit.

14:54.763 --> 14:57.070
You drugged me?

14:57.113 --> 15:01.335
Remember, Ronald,
we're on this journey together.

15:01.378 --> 15:02.989
Now, close your eyes.

15:03.032 --> 15:04.120
What for?

15:04.164 --> 15:07.515
Just close your eyes.

15:09.865 --> 15:12.955
Now, focus on your breath.

15:12.999 --> 15:14.739
That's right.

15:16.002 --> 15:19.005
Feel your body sink deeper
into the couch.

15:21.268 --> 15:22.443
Think of your mother.

15:22.486 --> 15:23.618
No!

15:23.661 --> 15:25.228
Absolutely not.

15:25.272 --> 15:29.580
Ronald, we have to explore
the darkest rooms first.

15:29.624 --> 15:30.886
I don't want to.

15:30.930 --> 15:32.409
I know.
Now, close your eyes.

15:32.453 --> 15:34.063
Go on, go on.
Close, close.

15:34.107 --> 15:36.587
Good, good, good.

15:36.631 --> 15:39.460
Now...
picture your mother

15:39.503 --> 15:43.029
here in this room,
in this space.

15:43.072 --> 15:44.987
What does her body
look like?

15:47.250 --> 15:49.035
What does it feel like?

15:50.601 --> 15:52.864
Remember the sound
of her voice.

15:52.908 --> 15:54.170
You're pent up.

15:54.214 --> 15:56.085
Go back to your room
and masturbate yourself

15:56.129 --> 15:57.173
while I make us
some lunch.

15:57.217 --> 15:59.045
No, don't say that, Mom.

15:59.088 --> 16:00.916
I'm a grown boy.

16:00.960 --> 16:03.440
- How does she make you feel?
- Not good.

16:03.484 --> 16:06.095
You're a sexual pervert,
aren't you, Ronald?

16:06.139 --> 16:09.707
"A mother is only as healthy
as her sickest child"?

16:09.751 --> 16:12.145
- I'm not sick.
- You filth!

16:12.188 --> 16:13.450
Please stop it.
Stop.

16:19.848 --> 16:21.893
No!
No, no, no, no!

16:21.937 --> 16:23.112
Stop it, stop it,
stop it!

16:23.156 --> 16:24.244
Now, talk to her, Ronald.

16:24.287 --> 16:27.116
What do you want to say?
This is your chance.

16:27.160 --> 16:28.248
You're a hypocrite!

16:28.291 --> 16:30.119
Why?
Why is she a hypocrite?

16:30.163 --> 16:32.121
She had urges, too.

16:32.165 --> 16:33.470
Right, Mom?
Worse than mine.

16:33.514 --> 16:35.255
But I kept yours
a secret.

16:35.298 --> 16:38.432
Like a good boy.

16:38.475 --> 16:41.043
Because I loved her.

16:41.087 --> 16:42.610
Tell me the secret.

16:42.653 --> 16:44.481
I can't!

16:44.525 --> 16:48.920
Ronald, you can be
a good boy again.

16:48.964 --> 16:51.619
Ronald, what did she do?

16:54.752 --> 16:56.667
She killed him.

16:56.711 --> 16:57.886
Who?

16:59.583 --> 17:01.194
My father.

17:01.237 --> 17:03.283
He hated her.

17:03.326 --> 17:05.502
He wanted to leave her,
but she couldn't have that,

17:05.546 --> 17:09.332
so she killed him,
and I saw everything!

17:14.381 --> 17:16.905
S-- It's, uh --

17:16.948 --> 17:18.950
It's okay.

17:18.994 --> 17:22.563
It's -- It's okay.

17:25.044 --> 17:26.132
You're a good boy.

17:26.175 --> 17:27.263
Yeah.

17:39.928 --> 17:41.234
How long has this
been going on?

17:41.277 --> 17:43.323
Oh, years now.

17:43.366 --> 17:47.327
She had the mastectomy
and...radiation.

17:47.370 --> 17:48.458
Thought we were in
the clear.

17:48.502 --> 17:50.895
Popped up again
in the lymph nodes.

17:50.939 --> 17:53.159
I know she wants to see you,
Jerrie.

17:53.202 --> 17:56.249
A-And to be honest,
I could use your help.

17:56.292 --> 17:57.989
She know you're here?

17:58.033 --> 17:59.948
Not exactly.
Mm.

18:01.515 --> 18:05.171
Look, I know things have been
strained between us --

18:05.214 --> 18:06.302
Whoa, n-no, there --

18:06.346 --> 18:08.261
there is no "us"
to begin with.

18:08.304 --> 18:11.046
And I don't remember having
any say in that matter.

18:13.004 --> 18:14.397
I didn't come here
to fight.

18:14.441 --> 18:16.573
No, you came here hoping to
absolve Mom of any guilt

18:16.617 --> 18:18.271
before she dies.

18:18.314 --> 18:22.144
You're asking me
to offer her forgiveness

18:22.188 --> 18:23.711
that she doesn't deserve.

18:23.754 --> 18:25.756
But did you ever stop
to consider

18:25.800 --> 18:29.325
what that might feel like
f-f-for me?

18:30.674 --> 18:33.329
Do you have any idea
what I've been through

18:33.373 --> 18:34.591
these past few years?

18:37.464 --> 18:39.335
Do you?

18:39.379 --> 18:41.598
We saw some things
on the news.

18:41.642 --> 18:43.252
And you did nothing.

18:45.428 --> 18:47.778
I'm your child.

18:47.822 --> 18:51.434
Please stop asking me
to be the bigger person.

18:55.438 --> 18:57.223
I don't know what to say...

18:59.050 --> 19:03.185
...except that death has a way
of shifting perspectives.

19:03.229 --> 19:08.408
And maybe you're right for
thinking we've fallen short,

19:08.451 --> 19:10.801
but you only get
one mother.

19:15.502 --> 19:17.068
Is that an apology?

19:17.112 --> 19:21.421
No.
God, no, it's not.

19:21.464 --> 19:25.251
I know nothing's gonna make up
for the way we acted.

19:25.294 --> 19:29.429
But I'm here, and I'm asking you
to do this one thing.

19:32.301 --> 19:33.911
I can't just leave.

19:33.955 --> 19:35.217
I've got a job.

19:35.261 --> 19:37.872
You can take
some time off?

19:37.915 --> 19:39.656
I don't know.

19:41.963 --> 19:44.183
Maybe it was stupid of me
to come here.

19:45.923 --> 19:49.362
But she wants to see you.

19:49.405 --> 19:51.494
I know that much.

20:00.895 --> 20:03.245
We have to get this stuff
off our hands, <i>now.</i>

20:03.289 --> 20:04.855
Well, we can't go
to the cops.

20:04.899 --> 20:07.336
If Harvey was dirty,
there has to be others.

20:07.380 --> 20:10.034
She's right. Now it's just us.
Nobody knows we're involved.

20:10.078 --> 20:11.688
How can you say that?

20:11.732 --> 20:13.081
That weird-ass woman knows,
and that creeper guy knows --

20:13.124 --> 20:14.517
Yeah, that "creeper" guy

20:14.561 --> 20:15.649
is the only reason
we're alive right now.

20:15.692 --> 20:16.911
I think
that we should figure out

20:16.954 --> 20:18.521
why he's trying
to protect us.

20:18.565 --> 20:20.306
You really think he was
protecting us?

20:20.349 --> 20:22.264
It seemed like
we were next on his spree.

20:22.308 --> 20:23.439
No, I really don't think
it was like that.

20:23.483 --> 20:25.311
Guys. Seriously.
I don't care

20:25.354 --> 20:27.835
if that man is Batman himself,
okay?

20:27.878 --> 20:29.271
We have to get rid of
this stuff

20:29.315 --> 20:30.272
before someone else
comes after us.

20:30.316 --> 20:31.491
Bridger, calm down.

20:31.534 --> 20:32.622
"Calm down"?!

20:32.666 --> 20:34.320
Madison, you almost died!

20:34.363 --> 20:36.278
We all did.

20:36.322 --> 20:37.323
Okay?

20:37.366 --> 20:38.628
This ends now.

20:38.672 --> 20:41.414
You're right.
Okay?

20:41.457 --> 20:42.980
But we can't
just dump them.

20:43.024 --> 20:45.287
That's not gonna stop
people from looking.

20:48.029 --> 20:50.292
We have to find a way
to return them

20:50.336 --> 20:52.425
to that woman
from Harvey's house.

20:52.468 --> 20:54.296
Wait, h-how are
we supposed to do that

20:54.340 --> 20:55.341
if we don't even know
who she is?

21:00.389 --> 21:01.782
Oh, my God,
it's Harvey's number.

21:01.825 --> 21:04.001
What?!
Don't answer it.

21:04.045 --> 21:05.438
It's that woman.
She took his phone.

21:06.265 --> 21:07.353
What are you doing?!

21:08.615 --> 21:10.007
Stop!

21:13.968 --> 21:15.361
You want her to track us?

21:15.404 --> 21:16.362
What about my phone?

21:16.405 --> 21:17.537
I'll buy you a new one.

21:17.580 --> 21:19.756
Okay, you guys,
we have to stick together.

21:19.800 --> 21:20.975
That is the only way
that we're gonna get

21:21.018 --> 21:23.020
through this --
as a team.

21:26.589 --> 21:28.330
Okay.

21:28.374 --> 21:30.245
Yeah.

21:30.289 --> 21:32.856
Bridger, you good?

21:34.423 --> 21:36.556
Yeah.

21:36.599 --> 21:37.557
For now.

21:42.257 --> 21:43.519
Things just got
even weirder.

21:43.563 --> 21:45.782
Guess who quit her job.

21:45.826 --> 21:47.131
Tonya?
Yep.

21:47.175 --> 21:48.698
I-- W--
How can she afford that?

21:48.742 --> 21:51.266
I don't know, but her manager
said that she left him

21:51.310 --> 21:53.834
in quite a bind --
didn't leave notice or anything.

21:53.877 --> 21:55.357
Well, maybe somebody
put her up to it.

21:55.401 --> 21:57.620
Hmm.
What's the update from Jenny?

21:57.664 --> 21:59.361
Oh, her hands are tied
with this.

21:59.405 --> 22:02.625
Jenny's hands are tied?
Really?

22:02.669 --> 22:03.713
I'd like to see that.

22:03.757 --> 22:05.236
Yeah, well,
State took over the case,

22:05.280 --> 22:07.413
so any work she does
will have to be off the books.

22:07.456 --> 22:08.588
In the meantime,
let's try to figure out

22:08.631 --> 22:10.459
who Tonya's staying with.

22:14.420 --> 22:17.205
You really think that creeper
was trying to help us?

22:17.248 --> 22:18.728
Don't call him that.

22:18.772 --> 22:20.556
Well, I don't know
what else to call him.

22:20.600 --> 22:24.604
It's just that, like,
he gave me this look, and --

22:24.647 --> 22:27.389
and I could tell
that he wasn't a bad guy.

22:27.433 --> 22:29.696
And now I'm worried that
something happened to him.

22:30.697 --> 22:32.655
I have to find him.
No, Harp.

22:34.483 --> 22:36.659
Look, I can tell your heart
is in the right place,

22:36.703 --> 22:38.574
but we literally saw him
kill someone.

22:38.618 --> 22:41.403
To protect us, Max.

22:43.840 --> 22:45.451
Look, I just...

22:49.455 --> 22:52.022
I just don't want anything bad
to happen to you.

22:54.851 --> 22:57.593
This is just something
that I have to do.

22:58.072 --> 23:00.466
But I will be safe.

23:00.509 --> 23:01.684
I promise.

23:16.699 --> 23:19.659
What is it? Did you
find something on Ronald?

23:25.360 --> 23:27.449
Jerrie.

23:27.493 --> 23:29.277
Hey.

23:29.843 --> 23:31.584
Hey.

23:32.498 --> 23:35.588
Talk to me.

23:35.631 --> 23:37.154
My mom is dying.

23:38.504 --> 23:40.941
I found out today.

23:42.508 --> 23:44.205
I'm so sorry.

23:45.685 --> 23:47.904
We aren't even close.

23:47.948 --> 23:50.472
I mean, we were
when I was little,

23:50.516 --> 23:52.692
but after I came out,
everything changed.

23:52.735 --> 23:57.305
And...we haven't spoken since --
since she kicked me out.

23:57.348 --> 23:58.524
I'm sorry. I don't --

23:58.567 --> 24:00.177
I don't know why
I'm telling you all this.

24:00.221 --> 24:01.657
Mm.

24:03.354 --> 24:06.357
Maybe 'cause I'm a friend
who cares about you.

24:08.751 --> 24:10.753
I don't know what to do.

24:12.755 --> 24:14.496
Do you want to see your mom
again?

24:16.672 --> 24:18.544
Yeah...

24:18.587 --> 24:20.720
and no.

24:20.763 --> 24:24.985
Like,
there's much I want to say,

24:25.028 --> 24:27.074
but the truth is...

24:29.163 --> 24:31.513
...when I was being held
in that cage that Ronald made,

24:31.557 --> 24:32.906
the other girls
and I talked about

24:32.949 --> 24:34.429
what we would do
if we got out.

24:34.473 --> 24:37.214
Like, if --
if we got a second chance.

24:40.653 --> 24:43.786
And I said I would want
to go see my parents.

24:43.830 --> 24:48.791
But then, life went on,
and --

24:48.835 --> 24:51.011
and why should I rush to
my mother now

24:51.054 --> 24:52.882
after everything
she's put me through?

24:56.843 --> 24:58.366
Uh...

25:01.151 --> 25:07.462
I'm a bit slow when it comes to
relationship dynamics,

25:07.506 --> 25:09.769
but, unfortunately,
I'm an expert

25:09.812 --> 25:12.380
when it comes to
not getting closure.

25:13.686 --> 25:16.689
If you go home...

25:16.732 --> 25:18.168
you don't do it for her.

25:18.212 --> 25:21.824
You do it for you --
because, trust me,

25:21.868 --> 25:23.217
if you don't have
the conversation

25:23.260 --> 25:26.568
with your mother now...

25:26.612 --> 25:29.397
you're gonna have it
a thousand times in your head

25:29.440 --> 25:31.051
after she's gone.

25:32.487 --> 25:34.141
You know I'm right.

25:38.841 --> 25:40.582
That doesn't make it
any easier.

25:58.644 --> 25:59.645
What are you doing here?

25:59.688 --> 26:02.256
Are you screening
my calls?

26:03.300 --> 26:04.519
I got busy.

26:04.563 --> 26:06.521
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, you look swamped.

26:06.565 --> 26:09.611
Whatever information you have,
I need you to tell me.

26:09.655 --> 26:11.744
Was Harvey working
for the cartel?

26:11.787 --> 26:13.789
I can't say.

26:14.703 --> 26:15.835
Why not?
What's changed?

26:15.878 --> 26:18.446
There's been a development,
Jenny, okay?

26:18.489 --> 26:20.491
I got a call from my handler
up at State,

26:20.535 --> 26:23.451
and I'm gonna have to
tighten things up.

26:24.234 --> 26:26.672
Did Dietrich have something
to do with Harvey's death?

26:26.715 --> 26:27.890
I can't tell you that.

26:27.934 --> 26:29.457
We're supposed to
help each other.

26:29.500 --> 26:30.806
That's our arrangement.

26:30.850 --> 26:32.460
"Arrangement"?
What the hell does that mean?

26:32.503 --> 26:33.635
What do y-- What do you mean,
"arrangement"?

26:33.679 --> 26:35.202
Huh?

26:35.245 --> 26:37.465
'Cause here's how I see
our arrangement.

26:37.508 --> 26:39.815
You call me whenever
you need something.

26:39.859 --> 26:41.338
It -- That's not --A-Am I wrong?

26:41.382 --> 26:42.818
Tell me I'm wrong.

26:44.472 --> 26:45.691
No.

26:45.734 --> 26:47.910
Here's the thing.

26:47.954 --> 26:50.521
I actually care about you,
Jenny.

26:52.393 --> 26:54.264
But I'm not gonna be some guy
you're gonna wring out

26:54.308 --> 26:56.092
for information
whenever the hell you want.

26:58.834 --> 27:01.010
I-I...

27:03.186 --> 27:04.579
I'm sorry.
No.

27:04.623 --> 27:05.928
I didn't --
I didn't mean --
No, no.

27:05.972 --> 27:08.278
You're gonna have to
back off.

27:11.151 --> 27:13.762
Hey, what --
what do you mean?

27:13.806 --> 27:16.069
Exactly what I just said.
You gotta go.

27:37.307 --> 27:38.700
Hi.
Hi.

27:41.964 --> 27:44.358
It was nice of Wolf
to reward you like this.

27:44.401 --> 27:45.838
Sit.

27:49.755 --> 27:51.713
I've missed you.

27:51.757 --> 27:54.324
Ow!
What was that for?

27:54.368 --> 27:56.718
Just making sure you're still
in there, my love.

27:56.762 --> 27:58.633
How's therapy going?

27:59.939 --> 28:01.854
Be honest.

28:03.464 --> 28:05.771
I had a vision
of my mother.

28:05.814 --> 28:07.598
She talked to me.

28:07.642 --> 28:08.730
You're making progress.

28:08.774 --> 28:10.863
Progress?
Yeah.

28:10.906 --> 28:12.778
This man is deranged.
Hey.

28:12.821 --> 28:15.998
He's keeping you away from
your daughter, for God's sakes.

28:16.042 --> 28:17.565
How can you just
play along like this?

28:17.608 --> 28:21.351
He promised to reunite us
if we were good.

28:21.395 --> 28:22.875
I will do anything --
anything --

28:22.918 --> 28:25.007
to be with my daughter.

28:25.051 --> 28:27.444
You believe him?
Yes.

28:27.488 --> 28:31.013
He even said he would send us
to his fishing cabin in Alaska.

28:31.057 --> 28:32.232
We could live there.

28:32.275 --> 28:33.624
I'm not buying it.

28:35.061 --> 28:38.804
But I've been doing my part
because I love you.

28:38.847 --> 28:40.631
We have no other choice.

28:40.675 --> 28:42.372
Yes, we do.

28:42.416 --> 28:44.113
We can escape, be free.

28:44.157 --> 28:45.898
Close the door.

28:45.941 --> 28:47.769
Come here.

28:47.813 --> 28:49.162
And then what?

28:49.205 --> 28:50.772
Where would we go?

28:50.816 --> 28:52.426
We'd be looking over
our shoulders our whole lives,

28:52.469 --> 28:54.558
and that is not free.

28:54.602 --> 28:56.125
I know it's hard to see,

28:56.169 --> 28:58.824
but Wolf has given us
an opportunity.

28:58.867 --> 29:00.216
We just need to
play it right.

29:00.260 --> 29:02.479
Scarlet, I love you.

29:02.523 --> 29:04.264
But from where I'm sitting,
I can't tell

29:04.307 --> 29:07.049
which one of you
is getting played.

29:07.093 --> 29:08.659
Don't you trust me?

29:18.060 --> 29:19.627
Come on.

29:30.072 --> 29:31.944
If this murder's connected to
the cartel,

29:31.987 --> 29:34.816
this is much bigger
than we thought.

29:34.860 --> 29:36.470
I told you
there's a war coming.

29:36.513 --> 29:37.688
I know it.

29:37.732 --> 29:39.212
I'm worried about Tonya.

29:39.255 --> 29:42.389
It's possible whoever killed
Harvey is after her, too.

29:42.432 --> 29:44.260
I think this has something to do
with Dietrich.

29:44.304 --> 29:45.827
We should focus
on that.

29:45.871 --> 29:48.395
Well, what is
Travis saying?

29:48.438 --> 29:51.659
Travis
is a dead end.

29:51.702 --> 29:53.052
He's icing me out.

29:57.012 --> 29:58.144
Wait, what's wrong?

30:00.929 --> 30:02.844
I think I actually
like him.

30:04.933 --> 30:06.543
Did you tell him?

30:06.587 --> 30:09.851
No. No,
I couldn't find the words.

30:11.244 --> 30:14.508
Ugh, I think
I screwed it up.

30:15.944 --> 30:19.121
Okay, well,
when this happens,

30:19.165 --> 30:20.949
you gotta eat
some ice cream.

30:22.168 --> 30:24.300
Rocky road ice cream.

30:24.344 --> 30:25.693
I might need
something stronger.

30:26.737 --> 30:28.000
Oh, great.

30:28.043 --> 30:29.523
I'm gonna be late
to Jerrie's thing.

30:29.566 --> 30:31.742
- You're gonna come with me.
- Oh, no. No, no --

30:31.786 --> 30:33.919
The stronger thing
is there.

30:35.007 --> 30:35.921
Tequila?

30:35.964 --> 30:38.271
Not my first choice,
but sure.

30:41.622 --> 30:43.145
<i>Sheriff's Deputy Trevor Harvey</i>

30:43.189 --> 30:46.148
<i>was fatally shot
Tuesday afternoon.</i>

30:46.192 --> 30:49.369
<i>There are no known suspects
connected to his murder</i>

30:49.412 --> 30:51.023
<i>at this time,</i>

30:51.066 --> 30:53.764
<i>but in
a shocking new development,</i>

30:53.808 --> 30:55.244
<i>sources close to the Lochsa
County Sheriff's Department...</i>

30:55.288 --> 30:57.246
Hey, what are you doing up
so late, sweetheart?

30:58.334 --> 30:59.727
Can't sleep.

30:59.770 --> 31:02.295
Sit down.
Talk to me.

31:02.338 --> 31:03.426
Are you okay?

31:05.167 --> 31:07.909
Yeah.
Yeah, I'm fine.

31:07.953 --> 31:10.042
Been so preoccupied
lately.

31:11.826 --> 31:15.177
Does this maybe have something
to do with Harper?

31:15.221 --> 31:18.137
I know you two --No.

31:18.180 --> 31:20.313
No, no, it's not that.

31:20.356 --> 31:23.185
<i>...may be connected to the
bodies found in Canyon Creek.</i>

31:23.229 --> 31:25.927
<i>But the news of Harvey's death
comes just months...</i>

31:25.971 --> 31:27.624
Honey.

31:27.668 --> 31:29.713
Honey, honey, whatever it is,
you can tell me.

31:31.541 --> 31:33.500
We can fix this,
whatever it is.

31:33.543 --> 31:36.285
No, we can't. Not this.

31:36.329 --> 31:37.983
Max, what happened?

31:38.026 --> 31:40.289
Mom, you don't understand.

31:40.333 --> 31:42.074
Just start
from the beginning.

31:45.773 --> 31:49.211
Okay, you have to promise
not to tell anyone.

31:49.255 --> 31:50.560
Who would I tell?

31:50.604 --> 31:52.214
T-Lock.

31:52.258 --> 31:53.346
I won't.

31:54.825 --> 31:56.001
Now just tell me.

32:04.139 --> 32:06.576
You know
the big car wreck last week?

32:06.620 --> 32:08.970
Over by the ridge?
Yeah.

32:13.192 --> 32:14.541
I was there.

32:16.717 --> 32:18.675
I did something bad, Mom.

32:31.123 --> 32:33.647
Okay, who's up
for another round?

32:33.690 --> 32:34.691
This one's on me.

32:34.735 --> 32:36.041
Oh, yeah!
Whoo-hoo!

32:36.084 --> 32:37.564
Yeah, says
the sober one.

32:37.607 --> 32:39.000
I think
you're cut off.

32:39.044 --> 32:40.175
Oh, no, no, no.

32:40.219 --> 32:42.438
Tonight's not the night
to cut me off.

32:42.482 --> 32:43.787
I hate to be
a buzzkill,

32:43.831 --> 32:45.137
but I think I got to
hit the road --

32:45.180 --> 32:46.355
I got a long drive
ahead of me.

32:46.399 --> 32:47.443
No.

32:52.231 --> 32:53.623
Here for you always,
Jerrie.

32:53.667 --> 32:55.190
I know.

32:56.931 --> 32:58.498
Bye, Jenny.

32:58.541 --> 33:00.021
I love you.

33:02.893 --> 33:05.374
You are gonna be so missed
in the office.

33:05.418 --> 33:08.247
Listen here, Denise, you ain't
gettin' rid of me that easy.

33:08.290 --> 33:09.465
I'll be back soon.

33:09.509 --> 33:11.293
Thank God.
I'll walk you out.

33:11.337 --> 33:12.903
It's past my bedtime.

33:12.947 --> 33:14.253
Bye!

33:16.342 --> 33:18.474
Two more shots
of tequila.
Oh, no.

33:18.518 --> 33:20.128
Okay.

33:20.172 --> 33:21.260
Two more shots
of tequila.

33:27.918 --> 33:30.486
Oh.
One, two, three.

33:32.445 --> 33:33.663
Ah.

33:33.707 --> 33:35.230
I hate it. I hate it.

33:37.798 --> 33:39.669
<i>Hello?
- Leanne.</i>

33:39.713 --> 33:42.890
I was beginning to get worried
that you were avoiding me.

33:42.933 --> 33:45.327
It's hard to believe
that one could be so busy

33:45.371 --> 33:46.111
that she couldn't pick up
the phone

33:46.154 --> 33:48.417
of her favorite author.

33:48.461 --> 33:49.462
Yes, but, Leanne --

33:49.505 --> 33:50.898
No, yeah, L-Leanne --

33:50.941 --> 33:52.204
No, look --

33:52.247 --> 33:53.683
Leanne, I am not Rick!

33:53.727 --> 33:55.250
Just know this --

33:55.294 --> 33:58.645
the subject of the next book is
gonna make us both rich.

33:58.688 --> 34:00.299
Leanne --

34:01.474 --> 34:03.041
Bad connection.

34:07.349 --> 34:09.351
Don't let it bother you.

34:09.395 --> 34:11.484
How's Ronald doing?

34:11.527 --> 34:14.269
We had
a breakthrough today.

34:14.313 --> 34:16.706
We got to the root
of his trauma.

34:16.750 --> 34:19.100
I could sing,
I'm so happy.

34:19.144 --> 34:20.754
Won't be long now.

34:20.797 --> 34:23.452
You really think
- you can pull this off?
- Aggie...

34:23.496 --> 34:25.672
What has he done
that makes you think

34:25.715 --> 34:27.326
that he will ever
turn himself in?

34:30.155 --> 34:33.375
Ronald being forthright
about his past

34:33.419 --> 34:36.378
is his first step
in recognizing his sins.

34:36.422 --> 34:39.338
And if he takes ownership,
then he will see

34:39.381 --> 34:42.254
that the only way forward
is confession.

34:42.297 --> 34:45.257
And when he confesses,
the Legarski name

34:45.300 --> 34:47.128
will be washed clean.

34:48.956 --> 34:51.785
Oh, okay.

34:51.828 --> 34:54.048
Why does Scarlet
seem to believe

34:54.092 --> 34:56.311
they're headed to a cabin
in Alaska?

34:56.355 --> 34:58.966
I told her that.

34:59.009 --> 35:02.796
I did it because you can't quell
a person's hopes.

35:02.839 --> 35:05.755
A person without hope
is dangerous.

35:05.799 --> 35:07.366
But trust me,

35:07.409 --> 35:09.019
for Ronald, there is only
one path forward --

35:09.063 --> 35:10.282
confession.

35:10.325 --> 35:12.980
And when he doesn't
turn himself in...

35:14.416 --> 35:16.070
Wolf?

35:16.114 --> 35:17.593
We put him down.

35:18.464 --> 35:21.075
But let's not focus on
any more of that tonight.

35:21.119 --> 35:25.427
Can we celebrate
this small win? Please?

35:35.133 --> 35:36.743
W--
What are you do--

35:38.266 --> 35:40.529
♪ <i>Only you</i>♪

35:40.573 --> 35:43.967
Come on, come on.

36:08.122 --> 36:10.211
Thanks.
Yeah, no problem.

36:10.255 --> 36:12.866
You, uh --
You packed light.

36:12.909 --> 36:15.129
I can appreciate that.

36:15.173 --> 36:17.218
Uh, I want you
to have this.

36:17.262 --> 36:19.438
It's, uh --
It's pretty out-there stuff,

36:19.481 --> 36:22.832
but -- I don't know --
there might be something to it.

36:22.876 --> 36:26.053
Very least, it could
maybe help with Jim the Dog.

36:26.096 --> 36:27.576
I'll give it a look.

36:27.620 --> 36:30.449
Oh, um, I got something
for you, too.

36:31.885 --> 36:33.626
For the drive.
Oh.

36:33.669 --> 36:35.323
People still burn CDs?

36:35.367 --> 36:37.456
No, age-shame me.
I'm totally fine with that.

36:37.499 --> 36:39.675
Oh. It's sweet.

36:39.719 --> 36:41.329
Thank you.
