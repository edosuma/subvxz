<i>Previously on Kyle XY...</i>

00:03.529 --> 00:04.792
So let me understand.

00:04.872 --> 00:06.853
The boy has no family that you know of.

00:06.933 --> 00:09.668
He doesn't communicate, and he was
found wandering alone in the city.

00:09.748 --> 00:11.904
But there is one more thing
we should see.

00:11.990 --> 00:14.156
- No belly button.
- I have a new patient,

00:14.236 --> 00:16.271
and I'm bringing him here
for a little while.

00:16.352 --> 00:18.639
- You don't know him.
- Don't want he touches my things.

00:18.719 --> 00:20.987
He's a very sweet, very special boy.

00:21.067 --> 00:23.447
He's this super brain... with amnesia.

00:23.527 --> 00:25.617
He can't understand the simplest things,

00:25.697 --> 00:27.928
but does calculus like it's 2 plus 2.

00:28.008 --> 00:29.810
He barely knows what
you're saying sometimes,

00:29.890 --> 00:31.973
but somehow speaks Chinese?

00:32.052 --> 00:35.139
Mom, I'm telling you, Kyle is not human.

00:35.250 --> 00:37.143
781227.

00:37.229 --> 00:39.491
Spelling out your alien birthday?

00:39.578 --> 00:40.782
It's you!

00:41.065 --> 00:43.696
1985?

00:43.893 --> 00:45.027
The guy in the photo.

00:45.107 --> 00:46.109
It's Adam Baylin.

00:46.189 --> 00:48.753
Adam Baylin has been
missing for 20 years.

00:49.035 --> 00:50.634
You gotta stop asking questions!

00:50.745 --> 00:52.923
If you don't, you're gonna put
your family in danger.

00:53.003 --> 00:54.853
- Who are you?
- It's Mom.

00:54.933 --> 00:56.759
The Peterson's live in Connecticut.

00:56.839 --> 00:58.136
I'll be ready to go by tomorrow.

00:58.216 --> 00:59.679
Now that I know, I'm ready.

00:59.759 --> 01:01.222
You're not telling me something.

01:01.302 --> 01:03.616
You've proven you can keep my secrets.

01:03.696 --> 01:06.503
If there was anything to tell,
don't you think I'd bring you in on it?

01:06.583 --> 01:08.283
- Thanks for everything.
- Take care, kid.

01:11.431 --> 01:14.576
I'll take care of 781227
and Adam Baylin.

01:14.656 --> 01:17.245
In the meantime, 781228

01:17.325 --> 01:19.261
is in excellent condition.

01:19.629 --> 01:20.710
What did you tell him?

01:20.790 --> 01:23.815
To go with the Petersons, it was the
only way to keep Tragers out of danger.

01:23.926 --> 01:25.234
You two are very good liars.

01:25.735 --> 01:27.115
It's our job.

01:30.249 --> 01:31.663
I'm Adam Baylin.

01:31.774 --> 01:34.167
- What do you want from me?
- What would you like to know?

01:34.247 --> 01:35.547
Everything.

02:39.464 --> 02:40.533
He's home.

02:40.705 --> 02:41.751
Home?

02:42.439 --> 02:43.829
With his parents.

02:44.505 --> 02:46.202
It's okay. It's just another dream.

02:47.099 --> 02:48.259
I have a...

02:48.579 --> 02:49.735
bad feeling.

02:51.071 --> 02:53.090
Kyle's okay.
There's nothing to worry about.

02:53.170 --> 02:54.205
Come on.

<font color=#00FFFF>Season 2 Episode 1:
The Prophet</font>

03:24.022 --> 03:26.014
Every story has a beginning.

03:31.104 --> 03:33.539
Every life has meaning and potential.

03:37.899 --> 03:39.475
But I didn't know my story's beginning,

03:39.555 --> 03:41.501
nor realize my true potential,

03:43.825 --> 03:47.144
until a few month's ago
when I first met Adam Baylin.

03:50.894 --> 03:53.464
I've waited a long time
to meet you Kyle.

03:54.522 --> 03:56.775
There's so much that I want to tell you.

03:56.855 --> 03:59.206
There's so much that I want to know.

03:59.870 --> 04:02.308
I'll answer all of your questions...

04:02.388 --> 04:04.506
at least the ones that I can.

04:06.079 --> 04:09.177
I want you to feel at home here.
Are you hungry?

04:10.407 --> 04:13.505
Would you like something
to drink after your trip?

04:16.451 --> 04:17.495
Thanks.

04:23.925 --> 04:25.081
Try again.

04:32.499 --> 04:33.987
What's the trick?

04:36.292 --> 04:37.547
There is none.

04:37.952 --> 04:39.870
The magic is in your mind.

04:40.350 --> 04:42.526
You only need to discover
and release it.

04:45.401 --> 04:46.657
Teach me.

04:47.481 --> 04:49.841
We'll have to start at the beginning.

04:50.124 --> 04:52.706
Are you familiar with
Einstein's contributions?

04:52.786 --> 04:54.344
I've read about him.

04:54.713 --> 04:55.795
He was a genius.

04:57.037 --> 04:58.389
No question.

04:59.373 --> 05:03.050
Why do we think Einstein's was capable
of such brilliance and innovation

05:03.148 --> 05:04.637
when his peers must have worked

05:04.717 --> 05:06.023
just as hard?

05:07.118 --> 05:08.384
He had a gift?

05:08.741 --> 05:09.786
Or...

05:10.425 --> 05:11.790
a head start?

05:12.577 --> 05:16.081
The typical gestation period
for a human being is 40 weeks.

05:16.168 --> 05:19.720
Einstein spent several weeks
longer in his mother's womb.

05:19.831 --> 05:21.995
His brain had more time to develop.

05:22.081 --> 05:23.642
That's why he was smarter?

05:24.257 --> 05:26.273
Well, not just smarter.

05:26.359 --> 05:29.241
Einstein believed it was why
he perceived the universe differently.

05:29.395 --> 05:31.473
There've always been rumors
that Einstein conducted

05:31.553 --> 05:34.273
a series of secret
experiments in the 1920s.

05:34.353 --> 05:37.872
Allegedly, he tested the idea
of extending natural pregnancy,

05:37.958 --> 05:39.556
mostly on primates,

05:39.790 --> 05:42.863
hoping the animals would
develop superior brains.

05:43.466 --> 05:45.799
But when the experiments failed,
they say that Einstein

05:45.879 --> 05:47.843
abandoned the project,

05:48.728 --> 05:49.730
although

05:49.810 --> 05:52.106
other scientists were still intrigued.

05:52.672 --> 05:55.623
They resurrected the experiments
in the 1950s,

05:55.807 --> 05:58.131
this time without Einstein

05:58.721 --> 06:00.676
and under tighter secrecy.

06:00.983 --> 06:04.844
They decided to implant human embryos
in surrogate human mothers.

06:07.340 --> 06:08.607
Did it work?

06:10.045 --> 06:13.918
After many failures, there was
one successful pregnancy.

06:14.730 --> 06:17.034
A healthy 13-month gestation.

06:17.673 --> 06:19.173
13 months?

06:20.550 --> 06:23.907
Unfortunately, the surrogate mother
died when the child was born.

06:24.608 --> 06:26.096
What happened to the child?

06:26.895 --> 06:28.641
You're looking at him.

06:32.588 --> 06:34.890
Okay, here's the deal.
Mom and Dad really need this trip,

06:34.970 --> 06:37.484
so you can't do anything
to stress them out while they're away.

06:37.564 --> 06:39.522
I'm planning a weekend
of quiet reflection.

06:39.608 --> 06:42.408
Seriously. If you have your
loser friends over, don't be total pigs.

06:42.488 --> 06:43.669
And keep them out of my room.

06:43.749 --> 06:45.777
Don't want their little hands
in my underwears.

06:45.857 --> 06:48.878
That was one time
in sixth grade. God, let it go.

06:50.462 --> 06:52.454
Okay, I think we have everything.

06:53.290 --> 06:54.557
We don't.

06:56.651 --> 06:58.483
Well, Lori is in charge.

06:59.454 --> 07:02.322
Not more than one friend
over at a time, and no one

07:02.402 --> 07:03.475
spends the night.

07:04.410 --> 07:05.826
If you're referring to Declan,

07:05.906 --> 07:07.508
I don't think that's a concern.

07:07.631 --> 07:09.278
Why? Is everything okay with you guys?

07:09.586 --> 07:10.816
We're fine...

07:10.902 --> 07:11.947
I guess.

07:12.537 --> 07:14.541
It's hard to tell what
he's thinking nowadays.

07:15.450 --> 07:17.319
Forget about things here.
Enjoy your weekend.

07:17.614 --> 07:19.176
Yeah. Just go. Have fun.

07:19.262 --> 07:21.524
It's not like you're counting
the minutes or anything.

07:21.610 --> 07:22.889
I'm down to seconds.

07:24.352 --> 07:25.627
All right. We'll call you later.

07:25.707 --> 07:28.074
If you hear from Kyle,
make sure he knows I have my cell.

07:28.154 --> 07:29.909
And give him the number of the hotel.

07:30.905 --> 07:31.950
What?

07:32.724 --> 07:33.794
Can we go?

07:43.457 --> 07:45.191
Sweet freedom.

07:45.634 --> 07:47.085
Give me half.

07:48.441 --> 07:50.654
Sorry. Bank's closed.

07:55.068 --> 07:56.491
You drew this symbol.

07:56.571 --> 07:57.748
For ZZYZX.

07:58.486 --> 08:00.539
ZZYZX was my conception, Kyle.

08:01.184 --> 08:04.939
My hope at the time was to create
children with more sophisticated brains,

08:05.041 --> 08:08.111
children who could enlighten the world
and advance civilization.

08:08.275 --> 08:10.408
So I continued the experiment.

08:10.494 --> 08:12.474
Even if it meant harming
more surrogate mothers?

08:12.904 --> 08:13.986
I didn't.

08:15.572 --> 08:18.659
I worked years on developing
an artificial womb.

08:21.635 --> 08:24.696
Finally, I designed a chamber
that I believed could work,

08:25.176 --> 08:27.241
and I invented a fluid

08:27.401 --> 08:28.615
that would provide oxygen

08:28.695 --> 08:30.493
and nourish the embryo placed inside.

08:32.448 --> 08:34.549
So there was no need
for a natural mother...

08:34.635 --> 08:36.191
and obviously,

08:36.274 --> 08:37.503
no umbilical cord.

08:37.698 --> 08:38.708
And as a result,

08:38.918 --> 08:41.426
the child would not have a belly button.

08:44.197 --> 08:45.583
You're saying I was gestated

08:45.663 --> 08:47.554
inside one of those tanks at ZZYZX.

08:49.509 --> 08:51.673
A carefully monitored chamber.

08:54.098 --> 08:55.438
So you created me.

08:57.012 --> 08:58.057
Yes.

09:04.549 --> 09:07.143
My first memory
is waking up in the forest,

09:07.451 --> 09:11.201
fully grown, covered in
that pink fluid you were talking about.

09:15.639 --> 09:17.791
How long was I kept inside that chamber?

09:20.435 --> 09:21.590
Your whole life.

09:30.391 --> 09:32.213
All the fine ladies showed up

09:32.293 --> 09:33.317
tonight.

09:37.436 --> 09:38.628
Check it out!

09:38.862 --> 09:40.180
Party of the year!

09:40.260 --> 09:41.444
The party's over.

09:42.637 --> 09:43.777
Such a tragedy, Kyle.

09:43.857 --> 09:45.867
Ever since you left,
the rowdy queen of rebellion

09:45.947 --> 09:47.973
has become a total buzzkill.

09:48.932 --> 09:51.550
I'm attempting thoughtful,
sober, and restrained

09:51.637 --> 09:53.773
until Mom and Dad
get over you being gone.

09:53.853 --> 09:56.551
Dude, you should be here.
It's, like, the whole school.

09:56.631 --> 09:58.067
Hey, I was talking to Kyle.

09:58.239 --> 10:00.784
- Actually, I should go.
- Wait. I want to hear how you are.

10:00.883 --> 10:03.047
Sorry. We'll talk later.

10:05.113 --> 10:06.920
He's always doing that.

10:13.510 --> 10:15.169
You cut it too close.

10:15.883 --> 10:16.891
I told you.

10:18.194 --> 10:20.765
I'm responsible for the security here.

10:21.871 --> 10:23.334
Two minutes, Kyle.

10:23.568 --> 10:25.133
Two minutes...

10:25.498 --> 10:27.356
or ZZYZX can trace the connection.

10:27.436 --> 10:28.614
I've been careful.

10:29.155 --> 10:33.629
You gotta stop pretending that you're
living with your parents in Connecticut.

10:33.851 --> 10:35.547
Stop contact with the Tragers.

10:36.469 --> 10:37.613
It's too dangerous.

10:37.699 --> 10:39.715
It's an unnecessary complication.

10:39.851 --> 10:41.486
It's necessary for me.

10:46.209 --> 10:49.522
If you didn't like dinner,
you could have just said so.

10:49.934 --> 10:51.200
What happened?

10:51.459 --> 10:53.464
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine.

10:53.550 --> 10:55.534
I just tripped over the table.

10:56.542 --> 10:58.162
His IQ's off the charts.

10:58.242 --> 11:00.501
His ability to avoid furniture,

11:00.587 --> 11:02.047
well, gets him every time.

11:02.127 --> 11:04.742
Kyle, this is Brian Taylor,
an old friend of mine.

11:04.988 --> 11:06.058
Very old.

11:07.312 --> 11:08.873
We grew up together.

11:08.996 --> 11:10.029
Nice to meet you.

11:11.824 --> 11:13.161
Me as well. I've heard...

11:13.241 --> 11:14.615
a lot about you.

11:15.131 --> 11:16.213
Really?

11:16.385 --> 11:17.430
Yeah.

11:17.885 --> 11:19.446
He tells me everything.

11:19.754 --> 11:21.254
Almost everything.

11:23.024 --> 11:24.693
All right, I'll check in on you later.

11:24.773 --> 11:27.366
I'll be inside
if you need me, all right?

11:29.074 --> 11:30.120
Kyle...

11:31.275 --> 11:33.144
living here alone, I've...

11:33.341 --> 11:35.148
relied on both of them over the years.

11:35.234 --> 11:38.237
Taylor's managed to turn
my dreams into reality.

11:38.336 --> 11:41.360
He brings any useful ideas
I have to the outside world,

11:41.446 --> 11:43.635
and it's Foss' job
to protect me from it.

11:43.868 --> 11:45.085
From ZZYZX?

11:45.663 --> 11:46.708
Yes.

11:47.040 --> 11:49.609
I sent him there to work.
He's my eyes and ears.

11:52.314 --> 11:54.613
Why did ZZYZX order my termination?

11:55.991 --> 11:58.256
I don't know. Years ago, I realized

11:58.336 --> 11:59.790
that some of my backers

11:59.876 --> 12:02.150
had other plans for the experiment.

12:02.261 --> 12:03.580
I protested.

12:03.961 --> 12:05.351
They tried to kill me.

12:06.236 --> 12:08.756
- So I just disappeared.
- But you left me there.

12:09.728 --> 12:12.617
Every time that I tried to remove
a subject from the chamber,

12:12.715 --> 12:13.794
the subject died.

12:13.874 --> 12:15.260
You mean the child died.

12:16.958 --> 12:18.839
I'm sorry. It's just that...

12:19.675 --> 12:21.347
I'm the subject.

12:21.519 --> 12:22.884
I'm the child.

12:22.982 --> 12:25.708
The original purpose
of the experiment was noble

12:25.788 --> 12:27.052
and good.

12:27.642 --> 12:30.337
It was supported by
a secret group of visionaries,

12:30.417 --> 12:32.038
great humanitarians

12:32.542 --> 12:34.030
known as Latnok.

12:34.140 --> 12:35.173
Latnok?

12:35.567 --> 12:36.907
It's Hungarian. It means...

12:37.005 --> 12:38.049
The Prophet.

12:47.548 --> 12:48.765
Ready to get started?

12:48.864 --> 12:50.840
Change within,
change the world around me.

12:50.920 --> 12:52.122
That's right.

12:52.589 --> 12:54.983
Once you teach your mind
to alter the positive and negative

12:55.063 --> 12:56.520
polarity of the cells in your body...

12:56.600 --> 12:59.056
- The glass will move.
- Not the glass,

12:59.142 --> 13:00.777
the water inside it.

13:00.876 --> 13:03.040
The glass is just a container.

13:03.594 --> 13:05.266
It's the content that matters.

13:07.073 --> 13:08.143
The content.

13:09.601 --> 13:10.683
Take a shot.

13:20.684 --> 13:22.122
I have no idea what I'm doing.

13:22.282 --> 13:24.212
It took me 20 years to master this.

13:24.299 --> 13:26.512
Give yourself at least 5 minutes.

13:29.887 --> 13:31.227
Free your mind.

13:35.432 --> 13:37.596
And concentrate.

13:47.421 --> 13:50.310
All the evidence of the festivities
has been eliminated.

13:50.409 --> 13:51.773
You actually made a list?

13:52.167 --> 13:53.987
I'm taking no chances here.

13:54.110 --> 13:56.274
Dumped the empty bottles
in our neighbors' bins,

13:56.372 --> 13:58.475
glued the broken picture frame,

13:58.573 --> 14:00.036
and got the stains out of the couch.

14:00.196 --> 14:03.033
The only thing left is making sure
you don't narc on me.

14:03.113 --> 14:05.385
I won't say anything.
They're still gonna know.

14:05.483 --> 14:07.537
There's always one
little thing you overlook.

14:07.623 --> 14:09.296
No way. I've got it all covered.

14:11.373 --> 14:12.677
Except that.

14:13.771 --> 14:14.841
Oh, crap!

14:15.726 --> 14:16.759
Nice save.

14:18.094 --> 14:19.323
Hey, guys, we're home.

14:19.426 --> 14:21.180
Hey. How was San Francisco?

14:21.266 --> 14:23.319
Oh, we had a great time.
Just what we needed.

14:23.405 --> 14:24.832
Yeah. How'd it go here?

14:24.918 --> 14:26.184
Everything's cool.

14:27.057 --> 14:28.458
No major damage?

14:28.544 --> 14:29.884
It was quite dull, actually.

14:29.970 --> 14:32.194
- Did a lot of reading.
- Have you heard from Kyle?

14:32.280 --> 14:34.441
- Just a quick chat on-line.
- How's he doing?

14:34.521 --> 14:37.247
Who knows? He signs off
so fast all the time.

14:37.345 --> 14:38.697
Well, he didn't call us.

14:38.783 --> 14:39.878
I hope he's okay.

14:39.964 --> 14:41.292
Maybe he sent an e-mail.

14:42.247 --> 14:43.329
What's this?

14:45.088 --> 14:46.670
I had nothing to do with it.

14:46.750 --> 14:48.493
Josh, start talking.

14:49.084 --> 14:50.498
I had a few friends over.

14:51.936 --> 14:54.125
Okay. How long am I grounded?

14:54.223 --> 14:56.965
Why don't you go get
next year's calendar.

14:57.297 --> 14:59.134
I don't know. What do you think?

15:00.388 --> 15:01.974
We just got home.

15:02.364 --> 15:03.863
Let's deal with this later.

15:46.913 --> 15:48.425
What are you doing?

15:51.855 --> 15:54.400
Trying to imagine what
it was like inside the chamber.

15:55.752 --> 15:57.745
Must be why I like the tub.

16:01.999 --> 16:04.003
You must have seen me
when you worked at ZZYZX.

16:04.753 --> 16:05.884
Yeah, I saw you.

16:05.970 --> 16:08.856
Did I know what was happening?
Was I aware?

16:08.936 --> 16:11.023
You were in some kind of sleep state.

16:11.577 --> 16:13.359
Did I look comfortable?

16:13.703 --> 16:14.871
You seemed to be, yeah.

16:15.080 --> 16:16.896
So I just stayed there
asleep the whole time?

16:16.976 --> 16:19.936
Look, I... I don't know
what they were doing to you.

16:23.023 --> 16:24.093
You saw me.

16:24.836 --> 16:26.609
A person floating in a tank
year after year,

16:26.689 --> 16:28.955
and you never bothered
to ask what was going on?

16:31.118 --> 16:32.618
I did my job.

16:45.867 --> 16:48.031
- Your parents are home.
- The door's closed.

16:48.215 --> 16:50.810
Which is technically
against their rules.

16:51.252 --> 16:54.154
If I don't break a few rules
soon, I'm gonna explode.

16:54.240 --> 16:55.774
It's not easy being the good girl.

16:55.854 --> 16:58.408
Well, here's your chance to corrupt me.

17:06.457 --> 17:07.686
What is it?

17:07.834 --> 17:08.878
Nothing.

17:10.220 --> 17:14.116
Come on. Where's the guy who used to
crawl through my bedroom window?

17:14.521 --> 17:16.698
I guess I'm... just distracted.

17:19.119 --> 17:22.255
Yeah... ever since Kyle left,
just like my mom.

17:22.340 --> 17:24.723
Comparing me to your mom.
That's not good.

17:24.803 --> 17:28.760
Well, we all miss him, but you can't
sit around and brood all the time.

17:28.845 --> 17:31.199
It's just... it was
pretty wild how he left.

17:31.297 --> 17:33.400
I know. So fast.

17:33.486 --> 17:35.145
No time for closure.

17:36.363 --> 17:38.133
Hey, he should come visit, right?

17:38.747 --> 17:39.915
Good luck with that.

17:40.272 --> 17:42.424
Why are you being so negative?

17:42.510 --> 17:43.702
Kyle's gone.

17:44.723 --> 17:45.866
He's not coming back.

17:46.210 --> 17:47.870
Can't hurt to ask.

17:50.661 --> 17:52.050
Hey, Kyle. How are you?

17:52.382 --> 17:54.423
I'm fine. How's it going with you?

17:54.521 --> 17:55.895
No, not this time.

17:55.975 --> 17:59.089
Tell me what's happening with you.
How are things in Connecticut?

17:59.457 --> 18:00.640
It's all good.

18:00.720 --> 18:02.113
Are you going out?

18:02.543 --> 18:03.687
A little bit.

18:03.797 --> 18:05.980
- Meeting people?
- A few.

18:06.219 --> 18:08.420
Getting along with your parents?

18:09.127 --> 18:10.442
Things are going well.

18:10.553 --> 18:13.381
- Well, things here kind of suck.
- Why? What's wrong?

18:13.467 --> 18:15.558
We're all basically craving
some Kyle-time.

18:15.644 --> 18:16.898
So here's the plan.

18:16.991 --> 18:19.979
Use our frequent-flyer miles
and catch a flight to Seattle.

18:20.077 --> 18:21.860
You want me to come to Seattle?

18:21.946 --> 18:24.454
It'd be so great if you
could surprise everyone.

18:24.897 --> 18:27.678
- Well...
- My mom would flip out, in a good way.

18:27.758 --> 18:28.868
Will you come?

18:34.673 --> 18:36.223
I take that as a "no. "

18:39.333 --> 18:40.858
I just stumbled.

18:43.729 --> 18:44.832
No.

18:44.912 --> 18:46.520
Something's wrong. Tell me.

18:52.249 --> 18:54.200
The two of us share a gift, Kyle.

18:54.280 --> 18:56.478
Our minds can enable our bodies to do

18:57.117 --> 18:58.577
extraordinary things, like...

18:58.657 --> 19:00.572
Swim faster. Jump off a roof.

19:01.261 --> 19:02.540
You jumped off a roof?

19:02.872 --> 19:04.458
I didn't know I wasn't supposed to.

19:07.236 --> 19:08.760
Foss told me you had a seizure.

19:09.560 --> 19:11.711
I was trying to hear
a distant conversation.

19:12.388 --> 19:13.431
Well...

19:13.776 --> 19:16.395
you put too much strain on your mind.

19:16.653 --> 19:18.912
I've spent years challenging myself,

19:18.992 --> 19:21.054
testing what I could do...

19:21.386 --> 19:22.690
at a great cost.

19:22.886 --> 19:25.469
My mind is stronger than ever,

19:25.555 --> 19:27.571
by my body is failing me.

19:27.682 --> 19:28.813
Failing you?

19:31.395 --> 19:33.387
Your mind's potential is...

19:33.473 --> 19:34.973
far greater than mine,

19:35.342 --> 19:37.519
and so is the toll
it can take on your body.

19:37.605 --> 19:39.695
You have to condition yourself

19:40.113 --> 19:42.230
or you're gonna die too young...

19:44.458 --> 19:47.409
...before you've even
had a chance to live, Kyle.

19:50.667 --> 19:51.699
The timer.

20:02.052 --> 20:03.168
It's hard,

20:03.248 --> 20:04.363
you know?

20:04.486 --> 20:05.962
You feel like...

20:06.048 --> 20:08.630
everyone looks to you for support so...

20:09.281 --> 20:10.552
You try to be strong,

20:10.646 --> 20:12.433
as usual. You try to...

20:12.527 --> 20:13.831
go on and...

20:13.933 --> 20:16.908
smile like everything's
back to normal, but...

20:17.621 --> 20:19.515
inside, you know it's not.

20:22.196 --> 20:24.307
It's like you've made
this strange and...

20:24.387 --> 20:26.708
powerful connection with someone,

20:27.163 --> 20:29.240
and then suddenly, he's gone.

20:29.990 --> 20:31.416
And you can't just...

20:31.514 --> 20:33.174
get on with your life.

20:34.471 --> 20:36.598
Not when you feel this void...

20:37.618 --> 20:40.151
and this terrible sense
that something is wrong.

20:43.370 --> 20:44.415
It just...

20:46.518 --> 20:48.048
I really miss him.

20:50.833 --> 20:52.100
You know, I...

20:52.408 --> 20:55.273
I feel like I've lost
one of my own children.

20:58.359 --> 21:00.813
You just let me know if
anything else comes up.

21:00.929 --> 21:03.641
I will. Just keep me
in the loop on things.

21:04.170 --> 21:05.215
Sorry.

21:06.199 --> 21:08.215
Kyle. It's okay. Come on in.

21:10.932 --> 21:13.354
Are you turning Adam's
latest dream into reality?

21:13.809 --> 21:15.469
Something like that.

21:16.747 --> 21:18.604
I heard he tripped again
the other night.

21:18.714 --> 21:20.264
Must have scared you.

21:20.555 --> 21:21.592
It did.

21:23.137 --> 21:24.826
How about that, huh, Adam?

21:24.912 --> 21:27.710
Someone else cares about you besides me.

21:32.122 --> 21:33.167
Well...

21:33.983 --> 21:35.184
I feel like I'm seeing double.

21:36.069 --> 21:38.405
- Talk with you later.
- All right.

21:39.880 --> 21:41.766
I hope I didn't alarm you.

21:41.995 --> 21:43.704
I'm still worried about the timer.

21:44.503 --> 21:45.954
Let me worry about that.

21:46.852 --> 21:48.336
We should tell Foss.

21:48.425 --> 21:50.500
No, we can't. He's too cautious.

21:50.869 --> 21:52.516
He'll want us to leave here,

21:52.602 --> 21:54.840
and there's still so much to do.

21:56.820 --> 21:58.763
I want you to remember this moment.

21:59.304 --> 22:00.508
After I'm gone,

22:01.320 --> 22:03.223
all of my experiences,

22:03.582 --> 22:05.205
everything I've studied and learned

22:05.414 --> 22:07.025
will be yours.

22:09.521 --> 22:11.635
Your mind is a powerful tool.

22:13.885 --> 22:15.372
Develop it,

22:15.508 --> 22:16.799
protect it.

22:18.729 --> 22:19.848
Use it wisely.

22:23.061 --> 22:25.377
But more important than your mind,

22:25.833 --> 22:28.156
it's your soul that touches people.

22:29.275 --> 22:30.922
You can touch the world, Kyle.

22:31.635 --> 22:33.070
It's who you are.

22:33.150 --> 22:34.894
It's who you're meant to be.

22:39.614 --> 22:41.537
How about Shanghai Garden?

22:41.869 --> 22:45.376
- If I see another lettuce wrap...
- Well, I can't live on pizza.

22:45.484 --> 22:46.765
Hey, guys.

22:46.897 --> 22:49.504
Dad, you and me :
mushroom, garlic, pepperoni.

22:49.590 --> 22:51.257
I had that for breakfast.

22:51.343 --> 22:53.187
Compromise: We go for sushi.

22:53.298 --> 22:54.651
An invitation to hell.

22:55.708 --> 22:57.011
Here's an idea:

22:57.146 --> 22:59.101
Mom could actually make something.

22:59.357 --> 23:01.894
What? She has time now.
She stopped working.

23:02.013 --> 23:04.691
Look, I know your mom
hasn't been as focused lately.

23:04.792 --> 23:05.837
Focused?

23:06.059 --> 23:08.604
I throw this awesome rager
while you're out of town,

23:08.703 --> 23:10.706
and she still hasn't
said a word about it.

23:10.805 --> 23:12.821
Swift, Josh. Remind them to punish you.

23:12.907 --> 23:16.153
And we will, believe me.
We just have to discuss how.

23:16.264 --> 23:18.094
Make me sweat it out, huh?

23:18.193 --> 23:19.736
Well, it's not working.

23:19.840 --> 23:21.574
It's totally working.

23:21.808 --> 23:25.373
Anyway, Mom's been in such a funk
since Kyle left, I asked him to visit.

23:25.471 --> 23:27.083
- Kyle's coming?
- I don't know. I mean

23:27.390 --> 23:29.640
I invited him but
he basically cut me off.

23:29.739 --> 23:31.927
I haven't heard from him since.

23:32.090 --> 23:34.644
It's gotta be tough he's trying to
connect with his real parents

23:34.724 --> 23:36.295
while staying in touch with us.

23:36.380 --> 23:38.397
So, what, we can't talk to him?

23:39.578 --> 23:40.979
Well, I just think...

23:41.065 --> 23:42.996
if we're all gonna move on

23:43.300 --> 23:45.369
we have to let each other go.

24:13.062 --> 24:15.791
- Ready to try again?
- I can't do this.

24:17.352 --> 24:18.569
Well, I told you.

24:18.667 --> 24:19.823
It takes time.

24:20.081 --> 24:21.311
No. I don't want this.

24:21.680 --> 24:23.524
I didn't ask to come here.

24:23.621 --> 24:25.539
I had people who I loved,

24:25.637 --> 24:26.978
who loved me.

24:28.232 --> 24:29.425
I had a life.

24:29.511 --> 24:31.229
You'll have an extraordinary life.

24:31.309 --> 24:33.147
I don't want to hear about Latnok

24:33.227 --> 24:35.523
or their experiments or how
I was locked in a tank.

24:36.667 --> 24:38.191
I'm a human being.

24:40.515 --> 24:42.052
How could you put me in there?

24:43.779 --> 24:46.447
Why did you create
me in the first place?

24:53.893 --> 24:55.196
I had no one.

24:56.314 --> 24:58.087
No real family.

24:58.724 --> 25:01.282
No one whose mind worked like mine,

25:01.552 --> 25:04.060
who could experience
the world the way that I did.

25:05.077 --> 25:06.762
I always felt different.

25:07.721 --> 25:10.266
And I thought if there
were another person...

25:11.913 --> 25:13.561
You didn't want to be alone.

25:15.701 --> 25:17.803
I hope in time you can forgive me, Kyle.

26:09.285 --> 26:10.461
What is it?

26:15.302 --> 26:16.645
He's been shot!

26:17.300 --> 26:18.391
Get inside.

26:18.686 --> 26:21.044
- Now!
- I won't leave him!

26:26.166 --> 26:27.470
I'm here.

26:27.962 --> 26:29.056
Please.

26:30.182 --> 26:32.966
There's still so much
you have to teach me.

27:15.833 --> 27:20.223
The briefest connection can make the
strongest, most indelible impression.

27:20.333 --> 27:22.445
Adam encouraged and inspired me

27:22.525 --> 27:25.386
and helped me unravel
the mystery of my past

27:27.587 --> 27:28.972
But without him,

27:29.210 --> 27:32.690
my future seemed more uncertain
and dangerous than ever.

27:34.706 --> 27:36.012
ZZYZX will kill him.

27:36.092 --> 27:38.222
They had the opportunity,
and they didn't.

27:38.314 --> 27:39.771
- They'll be back.
- Then we have to

27:39.857 --> 27:42.445
- get him out of here.
- And then what?

27:43.036 --> 27:45.335
And then Kyle runs
for the rest of his life?

27:45.421 --> 27:47.607
You build him a prison
to hide like you did for Baylin

27:47.687 --> 27:51.045
- Well, you tell me the alternative
- I worked security at ZZYZX for years

27:51.132 --> 27:53.090
I know every in and out.

27:53.732 --> 27:55.082
I'll go tonight

27:55.432 --> 27:57.674
- and eliminate the threat.
- You will do no such thing.

27:57.754 --> 27:59.494
What are you talking about?

27:59.678 --> 28:02.531
"Eliminate the threat?"
What does that mean?

28:03.785 --> 28:05.211
ZZYZX killed Baylin

28:05.617 --> 28:07.400
because he knew too much about them.

28:07.498 --> 28:09.195
You know too much, too.

28:09.415 --> 28:10.335
No!

28:10.415 --> 28:12.559
I have an obligation to protect you.

28:12.645 --> 28:14.772
- Not by eliminating anyone.
- They'll come after you

28:14.870 --> 28:17.199
- I won't let them find me.
- They'll target the Tragers

28:17.279 --> 28:19.256
to draw you out. Do you wanna be safe?

28:19.356 --> 28:21.918
Do ya? Do you want them safe?
Then I need to do this.

28:22.012 --> 28:23.524
You'll do nothing.

28:24.397 --> 28:25.823
You'll harm no one.

28:49.134 --> 28:51.027
Have you heard from Kyle?

28:52.100 --> 28:53.339
Not lately.

28:53.511 --> 28:56.807
Would you know if he's traveling
somewhere with the Petersons?

28:56.969 --> 28:58.711
He never said anything.

28:58.949 --> 29:01.097
Well, the last time
you talked to him, did he

29:01.177 --> 29:02.311
seem all right?

29:05.200 --> 29:06.922
What did he say?

29:08.324 --> 29:10.304
You know Kyle. He's a man of few words.

29:20.250 --> 29:23.926
Do you realize that was the longest
conversation we've had in weeks?

29:24.025 --> 29:25.894
And what a surprise.
It was all about Kyle.

29:26.029 --> 29:28.967
- Josh, I'm worried about him.
- You're worried about him?

29:29.484 --> 29:30.529
Right.

29:30.615 --> 29:32.471
I threw a party while you weren't home.

29:32.557 --> 29:35.508
There was unsupervised minors
messing around in our house.

29:35.851 --> 29:37.471
There was underage drinking and...

29:37.551 --> 29:39.396
inappropriate behavior and...

29:39.797 --> 29:42.404
probably a few illegal
substances I didn't know about.

29:44.174 --> 29:45.566
And you busted me for it.

29:45.646 --> 29:46.965
You actually found out.

29:49.326 --> 29:51.255
And then you did nothing.

29:51.366 --> 29:52.325
Nothing.

29:54.182 --> 29:55.567
By why should you?

29:55.927 --> 29:58.288
I only live here. I'm only your son.

30:03.231 --> 30:05.505
Feels strange not having him here.

30:06.414 --> 30:07.718
Yeah, it does.

30:09.881 --> 30:12.340
It seems Adam planned for everything.

30:12.936 --> 30:14.833
He was always ten steps ahead,

30:15.278 --> 30:17.080
preparing for every contingency.

30:17.381 --> 30:18.549
You mean he expected...

30:18.918 --> 30:20.295
To be killed?

30:20.625 --> 30:23.061
He had to live with that possibility,

30:23.578 --> 30:24.659
that fear.

30:25.950 --> 30:27.314
As will you now.

30:30.191 --> 30:32.110
I'll manage, like he did.

30:32.983 --> 30:35.255
You have to disappear for a while.

30:35.958 --> 30:39.462
We have to keep you as
far away from ZZYZX as we can.

30:40.347 --> 30:42.044
Foss thinks they'll find me.

30:43.445 --> 30:45.314
You let me worry about Foss.

30:50.528 --> 30:51.572
Where is he?

31:16.813 --> 31:19.831
I never thought I'd hear
Josh begging to be punished.

31:20.329 --> 31:22.315
It was more than that, and you know it.

31:22.413 --> 31:24.159
Look, I'm concerned about Kyle.

31:24.245 --> 31:27.634
That doesn't mean I'm not attentive to
Josh or anyone else in this family.

31:27.745 --> 31:28.802
Who are you kidding?

31:29.343 --> 31:32.616
Do you think you're fooling anybody
and you're not concerned about Kyle.

31:32.696 --> 31:35.295
You're being completely
stressed out and obsessed.

31:35.454 --> 31:38.790
Steven, I can't help feeling
that something is wrong.

31:38.885 --> 31:40.139
Well, get over it.

31:40.237 --> 31:42.057
He's not ours to worry about anymore.

31:55.964 --> 31:57.586
I know how much you miss him.

31:58.349 --> 31:59.489
I know

31:59.569 --> 32:02.601
that you can't stop caring
about him. We all do.

32:04.694 --> 32:06.932
But Kyle is not here, we are.

32:08.088 --> 32:10.842
We just need to feel
that you're here with us.

32:43.600 --> 32:45.543
The heart rate is stable.

32:45.801 --> 32:48.949
We'll move on to the next phase
as soon as possible.

35:12.324 --> 35:13.833
- What did you do?
- Get in.

35:13.932 --> 35:15.776
- They're innocent.
- They're not innocent!

35:15.874 --> 35:17.426
They killed Baylin! They'll kill you!

35:17.526 --> 35:18.574
No!

36:12.255 --> 36:14.342
I did what needed to be done.

36:17.674 --> 36:19.510
And you feel nothing now?

36:20.209 --> 36:22.143
- People died.
- I know that.

36:23.017 --> 36:24.914
- We're responsible.
- No.

36:25.000 --> 36:26.032
No.

36:26.623 --> 36:27.988
I'm responsible.

36:28.873 --> 36:31.652
Those people,
they ordered you terminated.

36:32.709 --> 36:34.531
They saw you as inhuman,

36:35.070 --> 36:36.117
as...

36:36.462 --> 36:37.470
expendable.

36:39.720 --> 36:42.400
The waste product
of a failed experiment.

36:46.212 --> 36:47.245
It's...

36:47.515 --> 36:50.183
Keep learning what
Adam had to teach you.

36:52.236 --> 36:53.711
Get stronger. Condition your mind

36:53.797 --> 36:55.420
and body like he said.

37:02.351 --> 37:05.425
He kept everything
organized, but there's just...

37:06.237 --> 37:07.909
there's so much of it.

37:08.388 --> 37:10.754
I just don't know where we should start.

37:12.561 --> 37:13.594
We?

37:16.323 --> 37:17.455
I'm gonna stay here

37:17.541 --> 37:20.295
and read his notes
and see if I can help.

37:22.336 --> 37:23.750
Why would you do that?

37:28.385 --> 37:31.286
You think I'm just gonna
walk away from you now?

37:37.052 --> 37:38.186
Sometimes

37:38.266 --> 37:41.712
the connections you make
with other people sneak up on you.

37:41.798 --> 37:43.545
You share experiences.

37:43.631 --> 37:45.121
You have a history.

37:45.201 --> 37:46.200
You form a bond.

37:49.864 --> 37:51.266
I should take a picture.

37:51.352 --> 37:54.893
You better do it fast. It's not gonna
last long. The natives are hungry.

37:54.991 --> 37:56.366
Dinner's my choice tonight.

37:56.446 --> 37:57.982
I think not.

37:58.253 --> 38:01.031
Excuse me? I can still taste
that chili you ordered yesterday.

38:01.129 --> 38:03.933
- Good. So you've already eaten.
- Let's not order in.

38:04.043 --> 38:05.973
- I'm with you. Let's go out.
- No, actually,

38:06.072 --> 38:07.504
I'd like to cook tonight.

38:11.241 --> 38:13.528
What, is that such a scary thought?

38:14.943 --> 38:16.538
No, no. That sounds great.

38:16.618 --> 38:17.649
Absolutely.

38:22.616 --> 38:24.239
And one more thing.

38:25.788 --> 38:26.993
No phone,

38:27.215 --> 38:30.092
no Internet, no video games for a week.

38:30.490 --> 38:31.536
Plus,

38:31.683 --> 38:33.048
you're getting a job.

38:33.368 --> 38:35.679
You need to take on
some real responsibility.

38:36.157 --> 38:37.202
Harsh.

38:54.527 --> 38:55.929
It wasn't your fault.

38:57.945 --> 39:01.031
Adam knew you couldn't
protect him every minute.

39:01.572 --> 39:02.925
I hope you know that.

39:06.564 --> 39:07.990
We should get started. You've

39:08.076 --> 39:09.121
a lot to learn.

39:11.753 --> 39:13.806
I won't be able to, not in this house.

39:13.904 --> 39:16.535
Kyle, you can't go back to the Tragers.

39:16.621 --> 39:18.422
If I stay here, safe but shut in,

39:18.594 --> 39:21.483
I might as well have stayed
inside that tank.

39:21.656 --> 39:23.619
I won't be able to touch
the world like Adam said

39:23.699 --> 39:26.103
if I'm not part of it.
- You don't know what you're asking.

39:26.183 --> 39:28.848
I know I can't tell them about
the experiment or the people who died

39:28.946 --> 39:31.466
without making them accomplices.

39:31.579 --> 39:33.519
I know I'll have to keep
my past a secret.

39:33.605 --> 39:35.203
You'll be lying to them, every day.

39:35.289 --> 39:36.335
No.

39:38.326 --> 39:40.367
I lied so that I could leave.

39:41.548 --> 39:43.638
And now I'll lie so that I can return.

39:45.187 --> 39:46.391
But beyond that,

39:47.794 --> 39:50.314
I'll do everything in my power
to live by the truth.

39:50.671 --> 39:53.167
Why do you wanna go back there
and complicate your life?

39:54.852 --> 39:57.212
It's not complicated. It's simple.

39:59.205 --> 40:00.410
I love them.

40:13.824 --> 40:16.347
Taylor will provide all the details.

40:16.750 --> 40:18.078
I understand.

40:20.352 --> 40:24.203
Well, you got what you wanted.
I expect you to honor our agreement.

40:26.022 --> 40:27.066
I will.

40:28.922 --> 40:31.025
It took a lot to get you here.

40:33.890 --> 40:36.436
I won't let you waste your potential.

40:41.267 --> 40:42.325
Thank you

40:43.161 --> 40:44.452
for doing this,

40:45.370 --> 40:47.550
for everything you've had to do.

40:50.452 --> 40:51.644
Be worth it.

41:07.148 --> 41:08.624
You made our favorites.

41:08.710 --> 41:11.698
Well, I'm making up
for a lot of missed meals.

41:12.288 --> 41:13.628
Welcome back.

41:15.743 --> 41:17.388
Is it ready yet?

41:17.468 --> 41:18.694
Almost!

41:20.957 --> 41:24.151
- It smells so good!
- I know. I'm dying here.

41:24.240 --> 41:25.704
Dinner is served.

41:34.151 --> 41:35.594
Oh, my God.

42:17.669 --> 42:18.937
In that moment,

42:19.195 --> 42:21.580
all the things I'd learned about myself

42:21.666 --> 42:23.757
all the gifts I need to develop

42:23.843 --> 42:26.142
and all the secrets I promised to hide

42:26.228 --> 42:27.408
didn't matter.

42:31.540 --> 42:34.502
All that mattered was being
home with my family,

42:34.601 --> 42:36.838
feeling that connection again...

42:40.786 --> 42:43.537
and knowing that I wasn't alone.
