WEBVTT

00:03.000 --> 00:04.599
I love you.

00:04.600 --> 00:07.839
Noooo!

00:07.840 --> 00:09.919
I cut myself so Suzanne could feed.

00:09.920 --> 00:12.439
Well, where is she?

00:12.440 --> 00:15.519
Did you check for a pulse?
- A pulse? - Yeah.

00:15.520 --> 00:18.399
Her body was here,
her head was somewhere over there.

00:18.400 --> 00:22.400
That little blonde bitch could
seriously screw up our plans.

00:22.720 --> 00:25.759
Whoa, easy! Who the hell are you?
I'm Harry.

00:25.760 --> 00:28.039
The least you can do is let me
buy you a drink.

00:28.040 --> 00:30.439
One drink. A shot.

00:30.440 --> 00:34.199
OK.

00:34.200 --> 00:38.200
Last night, I saw a guy.
He was attacking you.

00:39.080 --> 00:43.080
Raquel! Raquel!

00:43.160 --> 00:44.719
♬ I'm gonna catch ya

00:44.720 --> 00:47.239
♬ I'm gonna get ya, get ya

00:47.240 --> 00:50.039
♬ Oh, ow, oh

00:50.040 --> 00:54.040
♬ I wanna taste the way
that you bleed

00:54.800 --> 00:58.399
♬ Oh, oh, oh-oh

00:58.400 --> 01:02.400
♬ You're my kill of the night. ♬

01:03.160 --> 01:07.160
Raquel! Raquel!

01:13.880 --> 01:16.600
Sorry.

01:20.640 --> 01:22.999
I'll call her back. Call her back.

01:23.000 --> 01:24.839
He's the guy! The guy you got in
the car with.

01:24.840 --> 01:27.639
He's the guy I saw attacking you!

01:27.640 --> 01:31.640
You have to get away from him.
Just... get away from him!

01:32.040 --> 01:33.319
Call me!

01:33.320 --> 01:36.879
So... where are we going?

01:36.880 --> 01:38.519
To a bar?

01:38.520 --> 01:40.639
You trying to get me drunk?

01:40.640 --> 01:44.640
Could be.

01:52.000 --> 01:53.759
It's him! He's the guy I saw!

01:53.760 --> 01:57.760
Turn your bloody phone on!

01:58.040 --> 02:01.359
I don't usually do this.
Go on dates with girls.

02:01.360 --> 02:03.519
Is that cos you usually date guys?

02:03.520 --> 02:07.159
No. No. I was... I was joking.
It was a joke. Right. Sorry.

02:07.160 --> 02:09.719
Sense of humour failure. 
- OK.

02:09.720 --> 02:13.519
Well, um, now that we've established
neither of us is gay.

02:13.520 --> 02:16.439
We're cooking on gas, aren't we?

02:16.440 --> 02:18.159
Yeah.

02:18.160 --> 02:20.359
Do you work? Uh, no. Urgh.

02:20.360 --> 02:23.639
My brother has a job,
and I take money from him.

02:23.640 --> 02:25.359
How does he feel about that?

02:25.360 --> 02:27.479
Uh, well, sometimes he gets
all pissy about it,

02:27.480 --> 02:31.319
but, mainly, I just... ignore him.

02:31.320 --> 02:34.799
So... that's work covered.

02:34.800 --> 02:38.800
Hobbies? Ah. Yeah, I do pilates,
Tuesday evenings.

02:39.120 --> 02:41.959
My downward facing dog
is all the shit.

02:41.960 --> 02:44.519
Namaste, bitches.
Namas... namas-what?

02:44.520 --> 02:47.719
Namaste. It's what you say
at the end of a yoga class.

02:47.720 --> 02:49.159
"Namaste, bitches"?

02:49.160 --> 02:51.759
No, you don't... you don't say
the "bitches".

02:51.760 --> 02:54.839
That's kind of against
the whole yoga vibe.

02:54.840 --> 02:57.759
Hey, you should,
you should come to a class.

02:57.760 --> 03:01.760
Yeah. All these women in
their yoga pants, arses in the air.

03:02.200 --> 03:06.200
You can totally see a little...

03:07.800 --> 03:11.799
I... I need to wee. Big time. Yeah.

03:11.800 --> 03:15.800
I've got a bladder the size of
a small, prepubescent child.

03:17.320 --> 03:21.320
Go. Wee. Yeah. Good.
Back in a minute.

03:23.000 --> 03:29.074

04:19.720 --> 04:21.079
Ah!

04:21.079 --> 04:22.719
Why are you following her?

04:22.720 --> 04:24.519
If I tell you,
he'll send me to hell.

04:24.520 --> 04:26.319
If you don't, I will.

04:26.320 --> 04:29.679
So looks like you're caught
between a rock...

04:29.680 --> 04:33.680
and some really nasty faeces.

04:37.520 --> 04:40.439
Hi. I can explain.

04:40.440 --> 04:43.200
You better, or I'm sticking
your head down there with his.

04:47.960 --> 04:49.599
It's OK.

04:49.600 --> 04:52.759
It's OK.

04:52.760 --> 04:55.519
I knew your dad. Your demon dad.

04:55.520 --> 04:59.520
If anything happened to him,
I swore I'd look out for you.

05:00.720 --> 05:04.319
Us meeting like that, on the hill...

05:04.320 --> 05:07.639
...you were following me?

05:07.640 --> 05:10.719
You lied to me. OK, Who are you?

05:10.720 --> 05:13.239
I hunt the pricks.

05:13.240 --> 05:16.439
Well, the nasty ones anyway.

05:16.440 --> 05:19.399
Your dad, he was one
of the good guys.

05:19.400 --> 05:23.239
I liked him a lot. I'm sorry.

05:23.240 --> 05:26.039
I promised I'd keep you safe.
This guy was following you...

05:26.040 --> 05:28.519
I don't need you to keep me safe,
you patronising dick!

05:28.520 --> 05:30.799
So, all this, making nice,
going for a drink,

05:30.800 --> 05:34.439
it was an all an act,
it was all bullshit! No!

05:34.440 --> 05:38.239
Well, at the start, but then
I met you and everything changed.

05:38.240 --> 05:39.679
It wasn't just a job anymore.

05:39.680 --> 05:42.439
So what was it, then?
It was a happy coincidence.

05:42.440 --> 05:45.759
Shove your happy coincidence
down your lying throat.

05:45.760 --> 05:47.719
Well, isn't it obvious?

05:47.720 --> 05:50.159
I really like you.

05:50.160 --> 05:52.759
I didn't know how to tell you.

05:52.760 --> 05:56.479
I hated lying to you.

05:56.480 --> 06:00.480
I'm sorry.

06:04.280 --> 06:08.280
So...

06:09.080 --> 06:13.080
...what happens now?

06:14.800 --> 06:16.399
Did you really mean what you said?

06:16.400 --> 06:18.199
What, about the happy coincidence?

06:18.200 --> 06:20.799
No, numbnuts.

06:20.800 --> 06:24.800
Liking me? Yeah.

06:26.720 --> 06:30.720
You stuck his head down the toilet
because... he was following me?

06:31.160 --> 06:34.919
You should've seen
what's down there.

06:34.920 --> 06:38.920
That's... kind of kick-arse.

06:39.200 --> 06:43.039
And a bit romantic.

06:43.040 --> 06:47.040
There's something you should
know about me too.

06:47.480 --> 06:50.519
I don't have the bladder
of a small child.

06:50.520 --> 06:54.520
Also strangely romantic.

07:14.000 --> 07:16.519
First demon you ever killed?

07:16.520 --> 07:20.520
I was 15. Mrs Higgins.
She was my home economics teacher.

07:21.560 --> 07:23.359
She kept me back for detention...
Uff...

07:23.360 --> 07:26.279
...and the bitch tried to
stick my head in an oven.

07:26.280 --> 07:29.159
Flambeed her fat arse,
stuck a cherry on top.

07:29.160 --> 07:31.399
What about you? I was 12.

07:31.400 --> 07:33.959
Oh! He was my football coach.

07:33.960 --> 07:37.439
He never let us wear gloves -
even when it was snowing.

07:37.440 --> 07:41.440
He also murdered the goalkeeper.

07:41.520 --> 07:45.520
What? - It's nice to talk about
this stuff, with a guy,

07:45.640 --> 07:47.719
without them thinking
that you're bat-shit crazy.

07:47.720 --> 07:50.559
It really messes with
your relationships. - Yeah.

07:50.560 --> 07:53.799
The lies I've had to come up with to
explain all the wounds and bruises.

07:53.800 --> 07:56.759
I told this one girl
I got trampled by a donkey.

07:56.760 --> 07:58.559
By a donkey?

07:58.560 --> 08:02.519
She had these big floppy ears -
kind of reminded me of a donkey.

08:02.520 --> 08:04.359
Donkey ears. OK.
Did she believe you?

08:04.360 --> 08:08.360
No! No. Not at all.
It was a ridiculous lie.

08:09.320 --> 08:11.719
This is me. Oh, shit...

08:11.720 --> 08:14.239
What? I left my car at the bar.

08:14.240 --> 08:18.079
I made you forget you had a car?

08:18.080 --> 08:21.119
Are you doing anything tomorrow?
We could hook up.

08:21.120 --> 08:25.120
Sorry, is that too pushy?
It is kind of pushy.

08:25.720 --> 08:29.720
I think I'm OK with it, though.

08:32.120 --> 08:34.599
Where the bloody hell have you
been!? Whoa, what's going on?

08:34.600 --> 08:36.198
Who is he? Who?

08:36.200 --> 08:37.719
The guy, the guy you got in
the car with.

08:37.720 --> 08:40.558
OK, right, you're not going to
believe this, but...

08:40.559 --> 08:43.078
What? What!?

08:43.080 --> 08:47.080
He is a super cute, kick-arse
demon hunter.

08:47.440 --> 08:51.440
Yeah. He's what?

08:51.920 --> 08:54.559
What were you doing with him?
We went on a date.

08:54.560 --> 08:57.319
A date? You said
you were going to pilates?

08:57.320 --> 08:59.999
I don't even do Pilates
on a Thursday.

09:00.000 --> 09:02.559
It's Zumba and boxercise boot camp.

09:02.560 --> 09:05.279
I felt bad, going on a date

09:05.280 --> 09:07.759
after everything that
happened with Suzanne.

09:07.760 --> 09:09.519
Who is he?

09:09.520 --> 09:13.520
His name's Harry,
and he hunts the pricks.

09:13.640 --> 09:16.119
How hot is that?
I'll tell you - it's very hot.

09:16.120 --> 09:17.759
It's like, ooh, ah!

09:17.760 --> 09:19.239
How... how did you meet him?

09:19.240 --> 09:22.319
Well, my dad, my demon dad,
he asked Harry to look out for me,

09:22.320 --> 09:24.879
so that's why he was up the hill
when we were out in the woods.

09:24.880 --> 09:26.559
He's been following you?!

09:26.560 --> 09:29.679
Not creepy,
panty-sniffing following.

09:29.680 --> 09:32.799
It's more... sort of sexy stalking...

09:32.800 --> 09:35.279
Do you want some of
my nonna's spicy chicken?

09:35.280 --> 09:37.639
No, I don't want any of
your nonna's spicy chicken!

09:37.640 --> 09:40.519
What is up with you? Why did
you leave me all those messages?

09:40.520 --> 09:42.759
If you'd listened to even
one of them, you'd know.

09:42.760 --> 09:45.039
He's the guy,
the guy I saw in my dream.

09:45.040 --> 09:49.040
Who? Harry, demon hunter guy.
He was attacking you.

09:49.360 --> 09:51.319
Man, get the hell out... It's him!

09:51.320 --> 09:53.919
I saw it. You can't trust him.
He's going to hurt you.

09:53.920 --> 09:57.159
Well, the stuff you see,
isn't exactly clear.

09:57.160 --> 09:59.199
It's all cheese and shit.
I know what I saw.

09:59.200 --> 10:01.799
Do you?
So suddenly you're an expert?

10:01.800 --> 10:03.719
You've got a PhD in
seeing the future?

10:03.720 --> 10:06.519
All right, OK!
What exactly did you see?

10:06.520 --> 10:08.839
He sort of lunged at you.
He was attacking you.

10:08.840 --> 10:11.399
Lunged at me, lunged at me...

10:11.400 --> 10:15.400
Maybe that's because
I'm all irresistible.

10:15.840 --> 10:17.559
I made him forget his car!

10:17.560 --> 10:19.999
After his dick, that's a guy's
most treasured possession.

10:20.000 --> 10:21.439
You think this is funny?

10:21.440 --> 10:23.399
We'll see how funny you find it
when he kills you.

10:23.400 --> 10:25.359
That's hilarious(!)
You can laugh your arse off.

10:25.360 --> 10:27.079
Except you won't
because you'll be dead!

10:27.080 --> 10:29.039
You'll be lying there in
a pool of your own blood,

10:29.040 --> 10:31.319
and there won't be anything
I can do cos it'll be too late,

10:31.320 --> 10:35.320
and I will not let that happen!

10:38.680 --> 10:42.680
I think we should get some sleep...
and talk about this in the morning.

10:54.280 --> 10:57.679
I already lost one friend.
I can't lose another.

10:57.680 --> 11:00.919
I know. I get it.

11:00.920 --> 11:02.599
You're wrong about him.

11:02.600 --> 11:05.599
Are you sure he's not possessed?
You know how they can hide in there.

11:05.600 --> 11:08.159
You said some of them practically
never show themselves, ever.

11:08.160 --> 11:10.599
He is the least possessed person
I ever met.

11:10.600 --> 11:12.639
With everything that's happening,
it isn't right.

11:12.640 --> 11:15.599
This is why I didn't tell you.
Suzanne dying like that...

11:15.600 --> 11:17.839
It's got nothing to do with Suzanne.

11:17.840 --> 11:20.479
You sure about that?

11:20.480 --> 11:23.479
You get all paranoid, start acting
like everyone's possessed,

11:23.480 --> 11:26.439
it is going to mess with your head.

11:26.440 --> 11:30.440
I know. I've been there.

11:35.640 --> 11:39.640
I've never felt like this
about anyone before.

11:40.200 --> 11:42.479
I can be honest with him,
about who I really am.

11:42.480 --> 11:44.719
He doesn't even care
that I'm half demon.

11:44.720 --> 11:46.399
He's cool with it.

11:46.400 --> 11:49.559
That's why I thought
you'd be happy for me.

11:49.560 --> 11:51.559
I am.

11:51.560 --> 11:54.319
I just want you to be careful.

11:54.320 --> 11:56.159
I was born careful.

11:56.160 --> 11:58.479
I popped out of my mum's cooch,
like...

11:58.480 --> 12:00.359
"Safety first. Safety first."

12:00.360 --> 12:03.039
We should double date.

12:03.040 --> 12:07.040
Me and Tyler,
you and... demon hunter guy.

12:07.400 --> 12:09.839
You want to double date?

12:09.840 --> 12:13.840
Well, if he means this much to you,
I want to meet him.

12:13.920 --> 12:17.920
OK.

12:18.480 --> 12:21.319
What?

12:21.320 --> 12:24.359
I snogged the face off of him
in the toilets.

12:24.360 --> 12:28.360
I was all taking charge, like
a 21st-century horny bitch.

12:29.120 --> 12:30.719
Why were you snogging in toilets?

12:30.720 --> 12:38.720
Because my man was making
a demon eat shit. - Mm-hm!

12:50.222 --> 12:52.461
I went to the party venue
last night.

12:52.462 --> 12:56.462
It's looking great.

12:56.662 --> 12:59.461
Psyching yourself up
for the big day, eh?

12:59.462 --> 13:02.061
800 years in the making...

13:02.062 --> 13:06.021
and here we are.

13:06.022 --> 13:09.781
I'd be lying if I said
I wasn't a little nervous.

13:09.782 --> 13:12.621
It's going to be fine.

13:12.622 --> 13:16.622
It's a good plan.

13:17.262 --> 13:19.901
You know, I haven't totally
hated having you

13:19.902 --> 13:22.981
and your little, fatherless
bastard staying here.

13:22.982 --> 13:26.301
Wow.

13:26.302 --> 13:30.302
That's the nicest thing
you've ever said to me.

13:31.662 --> 13:34.702
I should go. Busy day.
Lots to do.

13:41.662 --> 13:45.061
Where are we up to
with ticket sales?...

13:45.062 --> 13:47.501
Well, start giving them away
for free!

13:47.502 --> 13:49.701
We're going to look pretty stupid
if the legions of hell

13:49.702 --> 13:53.702
don't have anyone to possess.

13:58.542 --> 14:02.542
Hey!

14:04.902 --> 14:07.781
Guys... this is Harry.

14:07.782 --> 14:09.701
This is my brother, Tyler.

14:09.702 --> 14:11.901
Hey. And this is Amy.

14:11.902 --> 14:14.701
Hi. Hi.

14:14.702 --> 14:18.702
Are we bowling, or staring?

14:19.382 --> 14:22.261
Is this him?

14:22.262 --> 14:24.661
Hi. Yeah, I don't think so, mate.

14:24.662 --> 14:27.141
OK. You do not want any part of
this.

14:27.142 --> 14:31.142
Let's, you and me, bowl.
I'll just go and get some shoes.

14:34.262 --> 14:36.941
Can we get some drinks?
Who do you think I am?

14:36.942 --> 14:40.942
A waiter? Oh, my God, you are
unbelievable! The sheer arrogance!

14:42.022 --> 14:46.021
Oh, it's OK. I'll get them.

14:46.022 --> 14:49.261
Mate, I'm Tyler, Raquel's brother.
Are you?

14:49.262 --> 14:51.821
That's not really a reason
for existing, is it? What?

14:51.822 --> 14:53.021
What?

14:53.022 --> 14:57.022
Do you have some kind of problem
with me? Yes. Yes, I do.

14:57.862 --> 15:01.862
Guys like you,
you're a Coldplay song.

15:02.822 --> 15:04.541
OK. No, whoa...

15:04.542 --> 15:07.421
It's not a compliment.
It is not a compliment.

15:07.422 --> 15:09.381
Yeah, I'm crushed.
Yeah, you are crushed.

15:09.382 --> 15:10.941
Really? Really.

15:10.942 --> 15:13.021
That's right. Jog on, Coldplay.

15:13.022 --> 15:15.741
What size are you?
Are... you allowed to do that?

15:15.742 --> 15:18.301
I work here. Right.

15:18.302 --> 15:22.302
Er, nine.

15:26.262 --> 15:29.501
Raquel says you've been
following her?

15:29.502 --> 15:31.421
She told you about that?

15:31.422 --> 15:33.261
Yeah - her dad asked me
to protect her.

15:33.262 --> 15:36.381
You hunt demons, but you're friends
with them? How does that work?

15:36.382 --> 15:38.301
Well, I guess it's the same for you.

15:38.302 --> 15:41.621
Raquel's half-demon.

15:41.622 --> 15:43.221
Is there something
you want to say to me?

15:43.222 --> 15:46.941
I'm just looking out for Raquel.
Me, too.

15:46.942 --> 15:50.942
Thanks for the shoes.

15:51.742 --> 15:53.861
Ooh! Get ready to lose, loser.

15:53.862 --> 15:57.862
I'm going crush your ego
to the size of... mouse balls.

16:00.142 --> 16:01.781
You OK?

16:01.782 --> 16:05.782
I don't think your friend, Amy,
likes me very much.

16:07.622 --> 16:08.981
I knew it!

16:08.982 --> 16:12.461
This whole thing -
the double-date bullshit...

16:12.462 --> 16:14.261
it was just so you can
check him out, wasn't it?

16:14.262 --> 16:15.821
I'm trying to protect you.

16:15.822 --> 16:19.181
By being all devious, and sneaky
and lying to me?

16:19.182 --> 16:21.221
You're the one person
who isn't supposed to do that!

16:21.222 --> 16:22.381
You're making a mistake.

16:22.382 --> 16:24.821
How can you not see that?
What's wrong with you?

16:24.822 --> 16:28.581
That's what people have been
asking all my life.

16:28.582 --> 16:31.461
I thought you were different.
I thought you got it.

16:31.462 --> 16:33.061
You're so desperate for him
to like you,

16:33.062 --> 16:35.421
you can't see what's going on.

16:35.422 --> 16:37.421
OK. I'm going to go,

16:37.422 --> 16:40.902
before I punch you
in your stupid face.

16:49.022 --> 16:51.941
Whoa! Very good.

16:51.942 --> 16:55.942
You see, when we trust each other,
we work together better,

16:56.022 --> 16:58.061
to achieve our common goals.

16:58.062 --> 17:02.062
See, goals plus trust
equals... success.

17:02.302 --> 17:03.941
This has been great!

17:03.942 --> 17:05.901
This could be a
real turning point for us.

17:05.902 --> 17:07.661
Look, I'm just glad you've
found it helpful.

17:07.662 --> 17:10.300
Any thoughts, questions, feedback?

17:10.301 --> 17:14.101
Well, you should take a turn.
Become part of our circle of trust.

17:14.102 --> 17:16.141
Of course. Yep, great idea.

17:16.142 --> 17:18.981
Let's do it.

17:18.982 --> 17:22.982
Hm?

17:23.182 --> 17:25.901
Jesus!

17:25.902 --> 17:27.661
You didn't catch me!

17:27.662 --> 17:29.741
You see, the thing is...

17:29.742 --> 17:32.301
soon you won't be able
to trust anyone.

17:32.302 --> 17:34.101
Your own granny's going to
stab you in the eye

17:34.102 --> 17:36.902
with an antique cake slice.

17:38.502 --> 17:40.741
I know we've had some setbacks.

17:40.742 --> 17:43.501
Opening the gates of hell,
it was never going to be easy.

17:43.502 --> 17:45.581
Trust me.

17:45.582 --> 17:49.261
Things are in motion
that will assure our success.

17:49.262 --> 17:51.341
It's been tough on all of us.

17:51.342 --> 17:54.501
But I'm done hiding,
denying who I am.

17:54.502 --> 17:56.861
We are going to be
out, loud, and proud.

17:56.862 --> 17:58.821
We are going to tear out
humanity's throat

17:58.822 --> 18:00.261
and shit down its neck

18:00.262 --> 18:01.821
until it chokes in a sea of blood.

18:01.822 --> 18:04.622
There will be death,
destruction and terror.

18:10.622 --> 18:13.862
Not while I'm talking! All right?!

18:17.222 --> 18:21.141
Where...? Where did you
hear up to...? Er...

18:21.142 --> 18:22.821
tearing out humanity's throat.

18:22.822 --> 18:25.742
All right, OK. OK, er...

18:26.902 --> 18:29.822
Let's try this again.

18:54.982 --> 18:56.581
Tyler?

18:56.582 --> 18:59.261
Seriously? You choose that guy
over me?

18:59.262 --> 19:03.262
He's so bland his dick
tastes of ice cream.

19:05.102 --> 19:06.901
Because he's...

19:06.902 --> 19:09.941
cos he's so vanilla.

19:09.942 --> 19:12.221
When do you get off?
Can you drive me somewhere?

19:12.222 --> 19:13.901
Why can't Coldplay drive you?

19:13.902 --> 19:15.821
I don't want him to know where
I'm going.

19:15.822 --> 19:18.541
I found this in Harry's wallet.
We should check it out.

19:18.542 --> 19:20.581
Ah!

19:20.582 --> 19:22.501
You and Tyler, eh?

19:22.502 --> 19:26.502
These lies will spread through
your relationship like a disease

19:26.782 --> 19:30.581
till there is nothing left
but an empty, deformed husk.

19:30.582 --> 19:32.941
I'll take that deformed husk,

19:32.942 --> 19:36.541
and I'll turn it into a
beautiful butterfly.

19:36.542 --> 19:40.542

19:47.742 --> 19:50.101
What exactly do you think is
going on with this guy?

19:50.102 --> 19:53.981
I don't know. Raquel's so into him,
she's not thinking straight.

19:53.982 --> 19:55.301
Are you...

19:55.302 --> 19:56.862
thinking straight?

19:58.622 --> 20:00.301
Your best friend died.

20:00.302 --> 20:03.901
If anything happened to you, I...

20:03.902 --> 20:06.421
Well, I can't think about it.

20:06.422 --> 20:09.341
I'm fine.

20:09.342 --> 20:11.301
I remember when
Randeep Singh died.

20:11.302 --> 20:12.941
Who's Randeep Singh?

20:12.942 --> 20:15.101
He was my dad's best friend.

20:15.102 --> 20:19.102
Dad used to tell me how they'd go
camping together as teenagers,

20:19.462 --> 20:21.661
laying out underneath the stars,

20:21.662 --> 20:24.101
swimming naked in the lake.

20:24.102 --> 20:25.661
A few years ago,

20:25.662 --> 20:28.781
Randeep was on one of his
frequent trips to San Francisco.

20:28.782 --> 20:32.621
Ends up drowning
in some guy's swimming pool.

20:32.622 --> 20:34.141
Dad were broken.

20:34.142 --> 20:36.541
I used to find him
staring at old photos of Randeep,

20:36.542 --> 20:40.542
just crying his eyes out.

20:41.222 --> 20:43.981
Are you sure your dad's not gay?

20:43.982 --> 20:46.701
What? Are you insane?

20:46.702 --> 20:48.621
My da...

20:48.622 --> 20:51.461
That's the most ridiculous thing
I think I ever heard.

20:51.462 --> 20:53.461
He watches Top Gear!

20:53.462 --> 20:55.221
Anyway, my point is,

20:55.222 --> 20:59.222
when someone close to you dies,
it affects people in strange ways.

21:00.062 --> 21:02.382
I'm worried about you.
You don't need to be.

21:11.702 --> 21:12.742
Hm.

21:14.102 --> 21:15.662
Come in!

21:18.502 --> 21:20.021
Oh, Raquel!

21:20.022 --> 21:24.022
I'll be right with you. Take a seat.

21:31.942 --> 21:33.661
So...

21:33.662 --> 21:34.410
how are we?

21:36.262 --> 21:39.181
Should I be concerned that you've
been missing your appointments,

21:39.182 --> 21:41.781
or is talking to me just extremely
boring?

21:41.782 --> 21:44.101
I wouldn't say it's EXTREMELY
boring...

21:44.102 --> 21:47.181
Well, spare me the half-arsed
compliments.

21:47.182 --> 21:50.301
So what have you been up to?

21:50.302 --> 21:51.821
You know... Stuff.

21:51.822 --> 21:54.821
You want to be a little more
specific?

21:54.822 --> 21:57.661
I've been spending a lot of time
with Amy...

21:57.662 --> 22:00.021
You mentioned her last time we
talked.

22:00.022 --> 22:02.541
You weren't sure if you were going
to be friends.

22:02.542 --> 22:04.981
How's that going? It was good.

22:04.982 --> 22:08.982
We had a sleep-over. I've never
had a sleep-over.

22:09.382 --> 22:11.261
She's been through some of the
same stuff.

22:11.262 --> 22:15.181
I really thought she got me,
you know?

22:15.182 --> 22:17.301
I trusted her.

22:17.302 --> 22:20.781
I thought she was my friend.

22:20.782 --> 22:24.141
I never had a friend like her
before...

22:24.142 --> 22:26.661
But maybe she isn't who I thought
she was.

22:26.662 --> 22:28.861
Did... something happen?

22:28.862 --> 22:31.221
She said some things about this guy
I like.

22:31.222 --> 22:34.501
There's a guy?

22:34.502 --> 22:36.541
Well, you have been busy.

22:36.542 --> 22:40.542
She says I shouldn't trust him...

22:40.622 --> 22:44.622
Do you think Amy accepts you for who
you are?

22:44.702 --> 22:48.702
I thought she did. Hmm.

22:51.022 --> 22:53.701
This has happened before,
hasn't it?

22:53.702 --> 22:55.301
Mmm. That girl was a major bitch.

22:55.302 --> 22:56.861
Amy isn't like that...

22:56.862 --> 22:59.661
Isn't she?

22:59.662 --> 23:01.261
We've talked about this,

23:01.262 --> 23:04.821
forming these very intense
relationships. You meet someone,

23:04.822 --> 23:07.901
you expect too much from them, then
they let you down...

23:07.902 --> 23:10.261
I've seen what it does to your
confidence.

23:10.262 --> 23:13.741
As much as you want them to be, not
all friendships are healthy.

23:13.742 --> 23:17.742
Sometimes you have to protect
yourself from people.

23:20.022 --> 23:23.701
This guy you fell out about...

23:23.702 --> 23:26.941
Harry. Tell me about him.

23:26.942 --> 23:30.942
It sounds all super cheesy, I never
felt this way about a guy.

23:32.422 --> 23:34.821
There's nothing wrong with a bit of
cheese.

23:34.822 --> 23:38.461
So Harry...

23:38.462 --> 23:42.462
...who is he?

23:46.342 --> 23:50.342
Wow. That is an incredibly
suspicious looking building.

23:54.782 --> 23:58.782
Where you going? We'll have
a quick look around.

23:58.942 --> 24:01.941
A quick look around?

24:01.942 --> 24:05.942
When did that ever end well?

24:17.662 --> 24:19.941
Amy? What you doing?

24:19.942 --> 24:23.942
Amy?
- Hey.

24:30.662 --> 24:33.021
Oh, yeah. You're fine!

24:33.022 --> 24:37.022
That's a healthy expression of
your grief!

24:38.702 --> 24:42.702
Unbelievable.

24:44.102 --> 24:47.581
This whole lone wolf, loose cannon,
Crazy Larry vibe.

24:47.582 --> 24:51.582
I've got to admit, I'm not loving
it.

24:54.222 --> 24:58.221
Is that Beyonce? It's Raquel.

24:58.222 --> 25:02.222
I guess that makes more sense,
cos she's local.

25:03.342 --> 25:05.421
What's that coming out of her
snatch?

25:05.422 --> 25:08.221
The Legions of Hell...

25:08.222 --> 25:10.221
Is that anatomically correct?

25:10.222 --> 25:14.222
I mean, assumed they'd be coming
out of her arsehole.

25:15.302 --> 25:17.781
Should have put a ring on it!

25:17.782 --> 25:21.782
Not the time...

25:26.542 --> 25:30.181
Mmm. Sorry.

25:30.182 --> 25:34.182
Just...

25:39.462 --> 25:42.621
I know you're angry with me.

25:42.622 --> 25:46.301
I found a flyer for a Halloween
party at Hampton Hall.

25:46.302 --> 25:48.741
I went there...

25:48.742 --> 25:50.381
There's something you need to see.

25:50.382 --> 25:51.501
I'm sending you a photo.

25:51.502 --> 25:55.381
Just call me, OK?

25:55.382 --> 25:57.141
I'm sorry.

25:57.142 --> 26:01.142
Call me.

26:23.102 --> 26:26.261
What does that mean? 
- I don't know.

26:26.262 --> 26:30.262
Evil flip-chart plans?

26:58.222 --> 27:01.741
Whoa!

27:01.742 --> 27:03.661
Amy...
A little tip.

27:03.662 --> 27:05.541
Take the canoe off the roof of your
car.

27:05.542 --> 27:08.141
It's kind of conspicuous.
It's a fair point.

27:08.142 --> 27:10.421
My mum says I can't keep it in the
garage any more.

27:10.422 --> 27:12.101
What with that and the old drum
kit...

27:12.102 --> 27:14.101
Oh, my God. Shut up.

27:14.102 --> 27:16.621
Sorry. Drop the trident.

27:16.622 --> 27:20.622
Erm...
Drop it.

27:25.982 --> 27:27.421
What?

27:27.422 --> 27:28.701
Mmm. It's nothing...

27:28.702 --> 27:30.781
You're making me paranoid.

27:30.782 --> 27:34.782
What did I do?

27:35.782 --> 27:39.782
I didn't think I'd ever have this
with someone.

27:42.622 --> 27:44.341
Don't let it go to your head

27:44.342 --> 27:47.181
cos I will beat that shit
right out of you...

27:47.182 --> 27:49.342
Then I definitely won't.

28:01.662 --> 28:05.662
Oh, shit!

28:08.142 --> 28:10.541
It was the blonde one,
and her dickhead mate.

28:10.542 --> 28:13.461
Dickhead mate? That's rude.

28:13.462 --> 28:15.301
Look, I'm done messing around.

28:15.302 --> 28:18.181
You take Little Miss Sugar Tits
somewhere quiet and put a bullet in

28:18.182 --> 28:20.821
the back of her head.

28:20.822 --> 28:23.861
What do you think? Take them here,
or follow them?

28:23.862 --> 28:27.301
They could kill them before we could
get close enough to do anything.

28:27.302 --> 28:31.302
Follow them.

28:57.542 --> 28:59.701
Yes!

28:59.702 --> 29:02.861
Yes!

29:02.862 --> 29:06.021
Oh, come on!

29:06.022 --> 29:08.701
Come on... Yes!

29:08.702 --> 29:12.702
Yes, yes, yes!

29:12.942 --> 29:15.382
Yes... Oh!

29:34.982 --> 29:38.982
We're stopping.

29:40.982 --> 29:43.261
OK. Get ready.

29:43.262 --> 29:46.541
You should wait here.
It's too dangerous.

29:46.542 --> 29:49.581
You think having a dick makes you
immune to danger?

29:49.582 --> 29:53.582
Man, be serious.

29:56.222 --> 30:00.222
Unleash the big dog.

30:29.782 --> 30:31.701
Is that the best you've got,
you pussy?

30:31.702 --> 30:35.702
I'm sorry I got you into this.

30:35.862 --> 30:39.862
You don't ever have to apologise
to me.

30:41.062 --> 30:43.661
Let her go, and kill me...

30:43.662 --> 30:45.901
Jake... Let her go.

30:45.902 --> 30:47.301
Kill me instead.

30:47.302 --> 30:49.301
No. That doesn't work for us at all.

30:49.302 --> 30:50.901
She's the one we want to kill.

30:50.902 --> 30:54.141
You're no-one. You're just a
dickhead with a canoe on his car.

30:54.142 --> 30:57.381
So technically, you could let me go?

30:57.382 --> 31:01.382
We could, yeah, but we're not
going to.

31:02.222 --> 31:03.781
Worth a shot.

31:03.782 --> 31:05.261
OK. If we're all ready...

31:05.262 --> 31:08.101
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
No, I'm not ready.

31:08.102 --> 31:10.781
Why do you need Raquel?
You don't know, do you?

31:10.782 --> 31:12.741
This is all about her.

31:12.742 --> 31:16.742
Why? Tell me...

31:17.502 --> 31:18.981
We've got time. What the hell.

31:18.982 --> 31:22.341
Erm, the stroke of midnight, on
Halloween,

31:22.342 --> 31:24.861
she'll act as a gateway.

31:24.862 --> 31:28.862
The Legions of Hell will pour into
this world.

31:30.022 --> 31:33.061
Are they really going to pour out of
her twot, like on the poster?

31:33.062 --> 31:34.981
No. That was a screw-up by the
designer.

31:34.982 --> 31:38.861
Anyway, so tens of thousands of
people will become possessed.

31:38.862 --> 31:42.661
They'll turn on their loved ones
and slaughter them.

31:42.662 --> 31:45.341
It is going
to be a bloodbath, seriously.

31:45.342 --> 31:47.221
Hell on Earth...

31:47.222 --> 31:49.821
So there you go.

31:49.822 --> 31:51.341
Holy Moses on a boat.

31:51.342 --> 31:53.061
We should really get on with this.

31:53.062 --> 31:54.741
Raquel! No.

31:54.742 --> 31:56.061
Oi, shit for brains!

31:56.062 --> 31:58.261
Raquel...

31:58.262 --> 32:01.141
So that's why you pricks have been
protecting me.

32:01.142 --> 32:03.581
You need me. Don't come any
closer...

32:03.582 --> 32:06.341
You can't shoot me. Oh, man.

32:06.342 --> 32:09.541
Screwed if you do, arse poled if you
don't...

32:09.542 --> 32:11.621
Put the gun down.

32:11.622 --> 32:13.341
Stay back... Stay back!

32:13.342 --> 32:15.661
I don't think I will. I'm going to
keep on coming,

32:15.662 --> 32:18.621
so if you're going to shoot me, you
need to do it now.

32:18.622 --> 32:20.141
Do it! Raquel. Shut up.

32:20.142 --> 32:21.661
He can't kill me.

32:21.662 --> 32:23.901
I'm the answer to their sick
little prayers...

32:23.902 --> 32:25.861
We can all walk away from this.

32:25.862 --> 32:29.461
Just walk away... You're going to
have a whole new style of walkin',

32:29.462 --> 32:32.861
like a chicken that's been nailed by
a bear.

32:32.862 --> 32:34.581
Put the gun down...

32:34.582 --> 32:38.141
Put it down! You want to give me
that?

32:38.142 --> 32:40.541
Raquel... He can't hurt me.

32:40.542 --> 32:44.542
I'm bullet proof...

32:47.982 --> 32:50.741
Yeah, now who's the dickhead with
a canoe on his car?

32:50.742 --> 32:54.701
You could have been killed... They
can't kill me, it's all right.

32:54.702 --> 32:56.861
Raquel...

32:56.862 --> 32:58.661
Get away from him... Amy?

32:58.662 --> 33:02.221
What're you doing? The flyer, for
the Halloween party.

33:02.222 --> 33:06.222
It was in his wallet... Whoa.

33:06.782 --> 33:08.421
You knew?

33:08.422 --> 33:09.901
You knew why they needed me?

33:09.902 --> 33:11.901
Raquel... How long have you known?

33:11.902 --> 33:14.861
Your dad told me. He didn't want
you to know.

33:14.862 --> 33:17.181
He thought it would be too much for
you to deal with.

33:17.182 --> 33:19.021
He made me swear I wouldn't tell
you.

33:19.022 --> 33:20.901
I wanted to. I'm sorry...

33:20.902 --> 33:23.581
None of this explains why you had
the flyer.

33:23.582 --> 33:27.341
I heard about the party, what they
were planning to do.

33:27.342 --> 33:29.501
That's why I had to stay close to
you...

33:29.502 --> 33:31.261
You were staying close?

33:31.262 --> 33:33.101
Is that why you had sex with me?

33:33.102 --> 33:34.381
No. Raquel.

33:34.382 --> 33:35.781
It's not like that...

33:35.782 --> 33:38.621
Wow. You really know how to make a
girl feel shit about herself.

33:38.622 --> 33:41.221
I fell for you... I shouldn't have
done, but I did.

33:41.222 --> 33:42.861
I'm sorry. You can't trust him.

33:42.862 --> 33:44.821
I would never do anything to hurt
you...

33:44.822 --> 33:46.101
You should have told me!

33:46.102 --> 33:48.781
I know... I'm sorry.

33:48.782 --> 33:50.741
I won't lose you like I lost
Suzanne.

33:50.742 --> 33:52.541
I won't let that happen.

33:52.542 --> 33:54.021
Amy.

33:54.022 --> 33:56.821
You're wrong about him.
I have to do this.

33:56.822 --> 33:58.821
Killing him is not going to bring
Suzanne back.

33:58.822 --> 34:02.061
I can't take that chance.
That's not your decision to make.

34:02.062 --> 34:03.141
It's mine.

34:03.142 --> 34:05.541
None of us knows what's going to
happen, not even you.

34:05.542 --> 34:07.341
He's worth the risk.

34:07.342 --> 34:09.781
He's worth it, to me.
I'm not going to lose you.

34:09.782 --> 34:11.501
You can't let the pricks change
you.

34:11.502 --> 34:13.581
That's what they want.
That's what they do.

34:13.581 --> 34:16.821
This isn't you. She's right.

34:16.822 --> 34:19.061
I hate seeing you like this.

34:19.062 --> 34:21.701
You can't start shooting people on
a hunch.

34:21.702 --> 34:25.702
That's not you.

34:26.982 --> 34:30.982
You're my Randeep Singh...

34:33.581 --> 34:35.822
No!

34:40.502 --> 34:44.502
Nooooo!

34:44.702 --> 34:48.702
Raquel. No! Raquel! It's OK...
It's OK.

35:02.582 --> 35:05.221
I'm sorry.
- It's OK.

35:05.222 --> 35:06.662
Just hold on.

35:12.750 --> 35:15.749
We need some help here, please!

35:15.750 --> 35:19.750
We need some help!

35:23.430 --> 35:27.430
I think if we've learnt
anything from this

35:28.270 --> 35:32.270
it's... never, ever bad mouth a
canoe.

35:32.870 --> 35:36.870
Cos you never know when one
might save your life.

35:43.430 --> 35:46.549
I was wrong about him.

35:46.550 --> 35:50.549
The way he talked you down,
he really cares about you...

35:50.550 --> 35:52.989
I'm sorry.

35:52.990 --> 35:54.149
Suzanne dying...

35:54.150 --> 35:55.509
I totally lost it.

35:55.510 --> 35:58.309
Amy... This whole
seeing the future thing,

35:58.310 --> 35:59.589
it's messing with my head.

35:59.590 --> 36:01.549
It's OK... It's not OK.

36:01.550 --> 36:02.669
The things I said to you,

36:02.670 --> 36:04.469
I hurt you.

36:04.470 --> 36:07.789
I was a total bitch.

36:07.790 --> 36:10.669
Yeah, you were.

36:10.670 --> 36:14.029
But you were looking out for me,
so a certain level

36:14.030 --> 36:18.030
of bitchiness is allowed.

36:20.310 --> 36:22.709
Are we OK?

36:22.710 --> 36:25.869
We're going to have to be.
With all this crazy shit,

36:25.870 --> 36:29.870
I can't see us making any more
friends any time soon.

36:30.630 --> 36:34.630
Looks like I'm stuck
with you, blondie.

36:44.670 --> 36:48.670
We'll be right here.

36:55.030 --> 36:57.909
Hey. How are you feeling?

36:57.910 --> 37:00.629
I feel like I got trampled
by a donkey.

37:00.630 --> 37:03.949
And then the donkey shot me.

37:03.950 --> 37:06.669
I should have told you...
Shut up, you idiot.

37:06.670 --> 37:08.069
That doesn't matter now.

37:08.070 --> 37:10.789
You just worry about getting
yourself better.

37:10.790 --> 37:13.589
What happened in there?
I get upset like that.

37:13.590 --> 37:15.349
It just happens.

37:15.350 --> 37:18.149
I can't control it...

37:18.150 --> 37:20.629
My dad always told me I was special.

37:20.630 --> 37:23.349
I guess he couldn't bring
himself to tell me

37:23.350 --> 37:25.309
I was "end of the world dangerous."

37:25.310 --> 37:27.469
You hang around with me,
you're going to get hurt.

37:27.470 --> 37:29.989
I guess that's a risk I'm going
to have to take,

37:29.990 --> 37:33.990
cos I'm not going anywhere.

37:35.950 --> 37:39.189
What are you going to do?

37:39.190 --> 37:41.069
I have to go away,

37:41.070 --> 37:45.070
somewhere they can't find me.

37:57.710 --> 38:00.829
You just get better, yeah?

38:00.830 --> 38:04.830
And, when this is over,
I'm coming back for you.

38:16.630 --> 38:18.909
Make sure it's fastened on tight.

38:18.910 --> 38:22.910
You do not want this bad boy going
airborne.

38:24.310 --> 38:26.709
What you did...

38:26.710 --> 38:29.229
...offering to give
your life for mine,

38:29.230 --> 38:31.909
after everything that's happened,
with...

38:31.910 --> 38:35.069
Tyler and...

38:35.070 --> 38:38.149
I'm sorry. I know how you feel
about me.

38:38.150 --> 38:40.989
I get it.

38:40.990 --> 38:43.309
I'm not saying I like it...

38:43.310 --> 38:46.710
Jake...

38:49.710 --> 38:53.229
How is he?
Yeah, he's going to be OK.

38:53.230 --> 38:54.949
It's three days to Halloween.

38:54.950 --> 38:57.869
What do you want to do?
Er, I'm a hand grenade.

38:57.870 --> 38:59.909
Some prick's
about to pull the pin.

38:59.910 --> 39:02.829
I guess we'd better
pack our bikinis.

39:02.830 --> 39:05.789
We're going to the seaside.

39:05.790 --> 39:06.829
♬ Come around

40:05.470 --> 40:07.629
Hi. I'm Doctor Weaver.

40:07.630 --> 40:10.149
How are you feeling?

40:10.150 --> 40:12.269
Sore.

40:12.270 --> 40:14.109
You silly bastard.

40:14.110 --> 40:18.110
Taking a bullet for her. That is
above and beyond my friend.

40:18.590 --> 40:20.149
Farren's an idiot.

40:20.150 --> 40:22.189
What's he thinking,
waving a gun around near her?

40:22.190 --> 40:23.669
She could have been killed!

40:23.670 --> 40:26.749
Easy tiger. Simmer down.

40:26.750 --> 40:28.349
You need to keep it together.

40:28.350 --> 40:31.669
Trust me. I've already spoken
to Farren.

40:31.670 --> 40:33.109
I heard you made him eat shit.

40:33.110 --> 40:34.869
You said make it look convincing.

40:34.870 --> 40:38.749
And you're playing it to perfection.
You and our special girl.

40:38.750 --> 40:42.269
I don't want to sound like an
arsehole...

40:42.270 --> 40:43.310
Have you...?

40:45.270 --> 40:46.829
You dog!

40:46.830 --> 40:49.949
You just be careful you don't show
yourself when you ejaculate.

40:49.950 --> 40:52.829
She sees you, and this whole thing
falls apart.

40:52.830 --> 40:55.429
Just use your regular cum face.

40:55.430 --> 40:56.949
I saw what she can do.

40:56.950 --> 41:00.869
It scares her. Well, it should.

41:00.870 --> 41:04.029
This has worked out better
than I could ever have hoped.

41:04.030 --> 41:06.029
It was like a trial run.

41:06.030 --> 41:10.030
She's the gateway to hell,
and you, my friend,

41:10.510 --> 41:14.149
you're the key that unlocks her.

41:14.150 --> 41:18.150
I brought you some grapes.

41:18.710 --> 41:22.149
Three days. Can you believe
we're actually doing this?

41:22.150 --> 41:26.150
Between me and you,
the thought of it...

41:27.430 --> 41:31.430
...gives me a hard-on.

41:52.670 --> 41:56.670
Showtime.
