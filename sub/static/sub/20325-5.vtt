00:15.683 --> 00:17.318
Previously on
The White Princess...

00:18.386 --> 00:20.888
This one looks
most like Teddy.

00:21.089 --> 00:22.323
Now tell me your name.

00:22.423 --> 00:24.758
Teddy.
I am the rightful
King of England.

00:24.858 --> 00:26.760
His name is Lambert Simnel.

00:26.860 --> 00:29.730
Routing his army has caused
grave injury to my uncle.

00:29.830 --> 00:33.033
It is a shame you
didn't marry Jasper.
Jasper is the man you love.

00:33.134 --> 00:36.170
Might we not cherish
something for ourselves?

00:36.270 --> 00:37.605
I have found
a wife for you.

00:37.705 --> 00:40.141
Kate Woodville.
The Dowager Queen's sister.

00:40.241 --> 00:42.276
"When you were first
with child, with Arthur,

00:42.376 --> 00:44.612
"I knew then that he'd never
be the king."

00:44.712 --> 00:45.813
What does she say?

00:45.913 --> 00:48.149
She says he will not be king.
She is wishing him to die

00:48.249 --> 00:49.750
They killed one
of the brothers.

00:49.850 --> 00:52.220
Richard escaped,
now we don't
know where he is.

00:52.486 --> 00:53.654
We have a guest.

00:53.754 --> 00:54.722
Is it really you?

00:55.723 --> 00:57.491
Our lost York Prince.

01:50.211 --> 01:51.645
*

02:12.200 --> 02:13.467
"My dear Elizabeth.

02:14.402 --> 02:16.737
"I write with news
of our success,

02:17.205 --> 02:19.273
"both here in Burgundy
and beyond.

02:21.209 --> 02:23.677
"I have received word
from the Doge of Venice,

02:23.777 --> 02:27.515
"who will publicly declare
his support for your son,
Prince Richard.

02:28.682 --> 02:32.085
"All over Christendom,
people sing songs
of his return.

02:32.286 --> 02:35.223
"Of a handsome York prince
with golden hair.

02:36.224 --> 02:37.891
"Our friends in Europe
are many.

02:39.793 --> 02:43.497
"For seven years they have
written to tell me of
their love for Richard.

02:45.499 --> 02:48.369
"Your son's cause grows
stronger every day.

02:49.537 --> 02:51.872
"Soon he will be ready
to come against Henry.

02:52.273 --> 02:55.576
"He will be restored and
take his rightful position

02:55.676 --> 02:56.844
"as King of England."

03:26.307 --> 03:28.976
Another letter for the
Dowager York Queen Elizabeth.

03:30.944 --> 03:32.613
I almost forgot
to invite the King.

03:55.369 --> 03:56.437
What is it?

03:57.705 --> 03:59.673
The Duchess writes
on behalf of so-called
"Prince Richard."

04:00.574 --> 04:03.611
Inviting the Queen and I
to be her guests at court.

04:03.711 --> 04:05.913
She is shameless.
You must refuse.

04:06.013 --> 04:07.315
Must I?

04:08.449 --> 04:10.718
And here I was
thinking what a pleasant
trip it might be.

04:11.519 --> 04:12.686
Prince Richard?

04:13.321 --> 04:16.156
The whole world knows he died
in the Tower years ago.

04:16.757 --> 04:19.327
-The Duchess
is either mad or a fool...
-She's neither.

04:21.061 --> 04:22.763
Of course she knows
the boy is an imposter.

04:23.030 --> 04:24.097
Like the last.

04:25.533 --> 04:27.167
What does it matter if
she is able to convince
people otherwise?

04:27.435 --> 04:29.036
The people of England
support you.

04:30.338 --> 04:31.405
Do not doubt that.

04:34.342 --> 04:36.910
There are rumors,
Your Grace, of...

04:37.845 --> 04:40.781
Nobles in the
southern counties planning
to flee to Burgundy.

04:41.615 --> 04:42.983
We shall close the ports...

04:43.083 --> 04:44.585
And stop all trade

04:44.885 --> 04:49.657
All legitimate travel
because of a rumor?

04:51.525 --> 04:52.993
England would be
up in arms.

04:53.527 --> 04:54.595
I agree.

04:55.929 --> 04:57.631
It is too drastic.
The world would think
I acted out of fear.

04:57.731 --> 04:58.966
How will you respond?

05:23.457 --> 05:24.492
Ah!

05:26.126 --> 05:28.028
A letter has just
arrived from the King.

05:29.096 --> 05:31.399
-We are summoned to court.
-For what reason?

05:31.465 --> 05:32.633
It doesn't say.

05:32.866 --> 05:33.967
What do you think
it could be?

05:35.403 --> 05:36.236
I couldn't begin
to guess.

05:36.837 --> 05:38.038
But we must
leave right away.

05:38.872 --> 05:40.040
Must I go?

05:40.508 --> 05:43.511
Maggie. We are the
King's loyal servants.

05:43.711 --> 05:46.914
Of course. It's just
so peaceful here.

05:48.416 --> 05:51.184
Hey. It's a trip
to court for us,
young man.

05:51.652 --> 05:53.454
At least it means
we can visit Teddy.

06:01.194 --> 06:04.532
Right then, young man.
Race me to the house.

06:07.801 --> 06:08.902
Here, Teddy.

06:10.604 --> 06:12.906
Books, ink and parchment.

06:14.608 --> 06:17.044
And best of all,
cheese from
our own cows.

06:24.518 --> 06:27.154
Teddy? Teddy.

06:30.458 --> 06:33.026
Little Henry
needs a cuddle
from his uncle.

06:35.763 --> 06:37.465
You shouldn't have
called him Henry.

07:01.855 --> 07:05.593
The Duchess of Burgundy
has invited me to be
a guest at her court.

07:05.693 --> 07:09.029
I have decided that
I shall send you
in my stead.

07:10.063 --> 07:13.000
- Of course, Your Grace.
- I would be honored to do...

07:13.100 --> 07:16.570
No. I meant your wife,
My Lady Pole.

07:18.205 --> 07:19.807
Me, Your Grace?

07:20.708 --> 07:22.510
The two of you together.

07:24.612 --> 07:27.815
But, Your Grace,
I've never met
my cousin Richard.

07:28.181 --> 07:30.784
Surely you would
recognize your own kin,
would you not?

07:31.051 --> 07:35.723
Who better to expose
this boy as a pretender

07:36.857 --> 07:37.991
than his own cousin?

07:41.629 --> 07:42.963
How do you respond,
My Lady?

07:51.038 --> 07:53.674
The princes and princess
have missed their cousin.

07:55.543 --> 07:56.810
As I have missed mine.

07:59.212 --> 08:00.948
All is well in Wales?

08:01.615 --> 08:04.151
A Tudor husband
is not so horrible
after all.

08:05.753 --> 08:07.788
I do not think of us
as York or Tudor.

08:09.256 --> 08:11.925
We are a family.
A happy one.

08:13.627 --> 08:15.896
Or would be,
if my brother
could be with us.

08:17.931 --> 08:22.135
And you? Here?
With the King?

08:24.572 --> 08:27.107
Every day he puts
a fresh red rose

08:27.207 --> 08:29.910
and white rose
into the Queen's rooms for me.

08:31.311 --> 08:33.080
Much has changed
between us.

08:36.049 --> 08:37.818
Ours too is now
a happy union.

08:40.888 --> 08:42.155
Please don't be
nervous, Maggie.

08:43.957 --> 08:46.594
The Duchess may be
persuasive to some,
but she has proved

08:46.627 --> 08:49.162
she will stop at nothing
to bring an imposter
against my husband.

08:49.797 --> 08:52.600
I am pleased the King
has so much faith in me.

08:52.700 --> 08:55.603
If you have any doubts
you must raise them
only to me.

08:57.605 --> 08:58.939
Do you think
it could be him?

09:00.774 --> 09:01.775
Your brother?

09:02.943 --> 09:05.212
My mother has clearly
told the Duchess
of Richard's escape.

09:06.880 --> 09:09.316
Make no mistake,
she is the architect
of all of this,

09:09.783 --> 09:12.052
It is just another urchin
our aunt has plucked
from the street

09:12.152 --> 09:13.754
and dressed
up as a prince.

09:15.088 --> 09:16.824
Richard was my brother.

09:17.390 --> 09:20.127
And I miss him every day.
But that boy is not him.

09:20.694 --> 09:22.630
And Henry must never know
of Richard's escape.

09:22.730 --> 09:24.632
For his sake and for ours.

09:27.067 --> 09:28.636
I will do my duty
to the King.

09:29.236 --> 09:30.237
Good.

09:33.206 --> 09:34.241
Come.

09:44.852 --> 09:47.120
We will be back
before you know it.

09:47.220 --> 09:48.756
You will be safe
here at the palace.

09:53.727 --> 09:55.663
He will be well.
You mustn't worry.

10:04.972 --> 10:06.006
God speed.

10:14.982 --> 10:17.184
Are you certain
you can trust Lady Pole?

10:18.618 --> 10:21.689
These women
are Yorks, Henry.
Never forget that.

10:21.789 --> 10:24.324
Her son is here
at Westminster.

10:24.424 --> 10:26.026
And her brother
in the Tower.

10:28.195 --> 10:29.329
We can trust her.

10:33.834 --> 10:35.135
The King has spoken.

10:38.906 --> 10:41.141
Your brother was
rude to me today.

10:45.145 --> 10:46.213
You hear me?

10:47.781 --> 10:49.349
I don't appreciate
his tone.

10:50.117 --> 10:51.819
Don't be so sensitive,
Margaret.

10:52.285 --> 10:54.421
I will not have
him jibe at me.

10:55.655 --> 10:56.790
Take him in hand.

10:57.958 --> 11:00.327
I will not lecture
the man whose army secured

11:00.427 --> 11:02.629
the Battle of Bosworth
for Henry, on decorum.

11:02.730 --> 11:05.733
You would have me
believe that that was
an act of selflessness?

11:07.300 --> 11:09.770
It would be the Stanleys'
first and last.

11:10.437 --> 11:13.741
I suppose we should
look to you as our model
for that particular virtue?

11:13.974 --> 11:15.508
I am selfless.

11:16.376 --> 11:18.746
My only interest
is the will of God.

11:19.880 --> 11:22.315
How fortunate his will is
so often in tune with yours.

11:23.751 --> 11:24.852
What do you mean?

11:26.086 --> 11:29.156
His will to place you
here as mother of the King
knows no bounds.

11:31.158 --> 11:33.961
He ordered the murder
of two small boys in
your cause, did he not?

11:54.381 --> 11:56.449
Lizzie.
Lady Mother.

11:56.784 --> 11:59.386
Have I not been
a loving and dutiful
daughter to you?

11:59.853 --> 12:01.088
You have.

12:01.188 --> 12:03.423
Have I not visited
and cared for you
these past years?

12:04.457 --> 12:06.894
Forgiven you for the lies
that you have told me?

12:07.260 --> 12:09.362
It seems something
upsets you.

12:09.997 --> 12:11.631
Of what
am I accused now?

12:11.799 --> 12:13.366
You must put
a stop to this.

12:13.466 --> 12:15.803
You think I do not know
that you are plotting
with the Duchess?

12:16.436 --> 12:17.805
Believe me.

12:21.141 --> 12:24.011
Your aunt
needs no help.

12:35.823 --> 12:36.990
I do not want
to read this.

12:37.090 --> 12:40.327
News of your brother's
health and success
do not please you?

12:55.042 --> 12:56.076
This boy...

12:57.644 --> 13:00.848
Is every bit as fraudulent
as the last one my aunt sent
to claim the throne.

13:02.049 --> 13:04.417
This boy is Richard.

13:04.517 --> 13:06.119
You cannot know that.

13:06.219 --> 13:09.022
He is your brother
and the rightful
King of England.

13:09.122 --> 13:11.558
You put me on
the throne with Henry.

13:12.125 --> 13:13.593
You made me
a Tudor Queen.

13:13.861 --> 13:15.528
I made you a York Queen.

13:15.628 --> 13:17.364
And now you would
just take that from me?

13:20.367 --> 13:22.936
Is the truth you have
always loved my brother
more than me?

13:23.971 --> 13:25.205
Oh, Lizzie.

13:27.407 --> 13:30.377
I have loved you
with all my heart

13:31.311 --> 13:32.913
for all of your life.

13:35.048 --> 13:36.549
No one is closer.

13:57.537 --> 13:59.406
I am old.

14:01.441 --> 14:02.910
I am fading.

14:07.314 --> 14:11.118
I should be with my eldest
girl as I live out my days.

14:13.320 --> 14:17.257
Your sisters have all
gone off to their own
husbands and families.

14:19.592 --> 14:21.228
I should be with you.

14:24.998 --> 14:27.267
But Henry would
never allow that.

14:37.945 --> 14:39.947
I love you, Lizzie.

14:46.353 --> 14:48.521
Henry will do anything
I ask of him.

14:51.658 --> 14:53.093
He loves me, Mother.

14:57.965 --> 14:58.999
And I love him.

15:18.351 --> 15:19.419
Your Grace.

15:21.421 --> 15:24.357
It is my hope
that your closeness
to your daughter

15:24.457 --> 15:26.126
will speed your
return to health.

15:26.226 --> 15:27.694
Thank you for
your kindness.

15:30.097 --> 15:31.398
I will visit you later.

15:38.538 --> 15:39.672
Your Grace.

15:42.275 --> 15:45.245
We intercepted these
at Greenwich.

15:45.345 --> 15:49.116
Signed and sealed
by English Lords.

15:49.682 --> 15:52.852
addressed to the
Duchess of Burgundy,

15:53.686 --> 15:57.524
pledging their support
for the so-called "York boy."

16:08.335 --> 16:09.402
Well?

16:10.603 --> 16:12.039
My men will make arrests.

16:12.072 --> 16:13.173
We should have
acted sooner.

16:13.273 --> 16:15.808
A handful of
traitors does not
make a rebellion.

16:16.043 --> 16:17.077
Not yet.

16:20.447 --> 16:21.448
The letters.

16:23.250 --> 16:24.384
How do they name me?

16:26.519 --> 16:27.654
Go on.

16:28.788 --> 16:30.157
Your Grace...
Go on.

16:33.293 --> 16:35.528
Henry the Pretender,
Your Grace.

16:38.398 --> 16:39.399
And him?

16:41.301 --> 16:44.137
Prince Richard,
Duke of York.

16:50.410 --> 16:53.346
Our son, Prince Harry
is the Duke of York.

16:55.348 --> 16:56.449
Ennoble him.

16:57.650 --> 16:59.386
Give people their
rightful Duke.

16:59.486 --> 17:00.787
Let us celebrate
our strength.

17:02.822 --> 17:04.224
The Queen is right.

17:06.159 --> 17:08.095
We will make
Prince Harry a Duke,

17:08.128 --> 17:10.097
and when Lady Pole
returns from Burgundy,

17:10.197 --> 17:12.299
she will denounce
the boy publicly.

17:16.469 --> 17:17.504
Very well.

17:19.106 --> 17:20.173
Make plans.

17:23.876 --> 17:25.712
Do not arrest the
traitors yet, I have...

17:27.247 --> 17:29.116
A different thought
of how to deal with it.

17:52.839 --> 17:54.141
Duchess.

17:54.641 --> 17:55.642
Aunt.

17:57.510 --> 17:58.611
Lady Grandmother.

18:08.455 --> 18:11.158
Such a pity the
King and Queen
could not join us.

18:11.558 --> 18:14.327
But it is a pleasure
to welcome my niece and
her husband to court.

18:14.427 --> 18:16.429
We thank you for your
hospitality, My Lady.

18:16.529 --> 18:20.200
Prince Richard
is very much looking
forward to seeing his cousin.

18:21.201 --> 18:24.571
I understand you will
miss the young
Duke's ennobling.

18:24.871 --> 18:28.475
Such a strange event
given that the title
is already taken.

18:31.178 --> 18:32.745
Forgive me.
I merely tease.

18:33.913 --> 18:35.682
It's been a long journey.

18:35.882 --> 18:38.451
Let's allow our guests
to settle into their rooms.

18:38.551 --> 18:39.786
Of course.

18:39.886 --> 18:42.355
And later you will
meet the Prince.

18:43.756 --> 18:46.659
Lady Grandmother,
perhaps you might show
me the grounds first?

18:48.728 --> 18:51.198
It is a pleasure
to have you here,
Maggie.

18:52.232 --> 18:54.901
I did not think
to see you in Burgundy.

18:55.435 --> 18:59.539
No, nor would I be,
but the King requested it.

19:00.907 --> 19:03.676
Tell me about
your own family.
Your son?

19:03.876 --> 19:05.945
-Little Henry.
-Mmm-hmm?

19:06.213 --> 19:07.714
-He is five.
-Oh!

19:08.715 --> 19:11.318
A precious age.
Hold him close.

19:11.418 --> 19:14.287
I would so love
for you to meet him,
Lady Grandmother.

19:14.754 --> 19:19.526
Well, I will not return
to England. Not while
Henry Tudor's on the throne.

19:20.327 --> 19:22.429
But, if your aunt
has her way

19:23.696 --> 19:26.233
we will all be
restored by Richard.

19:28.968 --> 19:31.238
You are convinced
it is him, then?

19:32.672 --> 19:36.576
And you are here to
prove he is another
imposter, of course?

19:36.943 --> 19:39.312
Another peasant
picked from the fields?

19:40.847 --> 19:42.315
- Hmm?
- Cathy!

19:44.317 --> 19:47.287
It makes me joyful every day
to see you in my gardens.
It is my joy.

19:47.387 --> 19:48.455
Who's that?

19:50.457 --> 19:51.791
Lady Cathy Gordon.

19:52.992 --> 19:55.595
Cousin to King James
of Scotland.

19:55.695 --> 19:57.264
A little older
than the Prince...

19:58.898 --> 20:00.400
But as I said.

20:00.500 --> 20:04.337
Your aunt is never
at a loss for schemes
to occupy her.

20:30.663 --> 20:31.698
My Lady Margaret.

20:33.366 --> 20:35.902
I should have guessed
that your idea would be
the same as mine.

20:37.404 --> 20:39.005
To make all this...

20:39.939 --> 20:41.308
Perfect for our boy.

20:41.741 --> 20:43.042
Our beloved Harry.

20:43.876 --> 20:47.480
You have been
a grandfather to him
in every way that matters.

20:49.349 --> 20:50.983
And father to my son.

20:56.088 --> 20:57.857
You have given
so much for him.

20:59.392 --> 21:02.329
I regret no injury
sustained in the
service of my King.

21:05.031 --> 21:07.467
You are happy, Jasper,
aren't you?

21:09.436 --> 21:11.504
Your York wife
makes you glad?

21:15.808 --> 21:18.345
She is kind. And caring.

21:20.813 --> 21:21.914
She is patient with me.

21:25.518 --> 21:26.853
Then I am glad too,
Jasper.

21:30.790 --> 21:32.992
We will always
both share Henry.

21:36.863 --> 21:37.930
My Lord.

21:41.434 --> 21:42.635
My Lady.

21:44.504 --> 21:46.439
My Lady,
the King's Mother.

21:47.774 --> 21:48.941
We shall see you
at the banquet.

21:52.745 --> 21:53.846
Come, Kate.

22:10.963 --> 22:12.832
*

23:18.631 --> 23:21.133
Prince Henry of England.
I name you...

23:22.769 --> 23:23.803
Duke of York.

23:53.600 --> 23:55.568
Duchess, you put on
quite the spectacle.

24:01.974 --> 24:03.843
Ah, here he comes!

24:09.582 --> 24:12.719
Prince Richard,
Duke of York.

24:17.223 --> 24:19.559
Today we welcome
guests from England.

24:20.727 --> 24:21.961
Sir Richard Pole.

24:23.262 --> 24:25.097
And Margaret Pole,
your cousin.

24:26.699 --> 24:29.168
Welcome, cousin.
Sir Richard.

24:32.972 --> 24:34.373
Come, Maggie.

24:34.541 --> 24:37.176
Come and sit next
to your cousin so you
can speak freely.

24:37.544 --> 24:40.613
If it pleases my cousin,
then I can think of nothing
that I would enjoy more.

24:51.991 --> 24:55.061
Today, Prince Henry
was ennobled.

25:09.976 --> 25:12.579
Our road to this moment
has not been an easy one.

25:12.645 --> 25:14.981
But we gather today secure.

25:16.382 --> 25:19.986
We have two sons
and our line is strong.

25:22.154 --> 25:23.189
A toast.

25:28.360 --> 25:31.063
To my son.
The Duke of York.

25:31.163 --> 25:32.765
The Duke of York.

25:33.600 --> 25:36.669
I would also like to propose
a toast to the Duke of York.

25:38.104 --> 25:40.940
My son, Prince Richard,

25:41.307 --> 25:44.076
who is alive and
well in Burgundy...

25:44.176 --> 25:45.477
Remove her...

25:45.678 --> 25:48.815
And any noble here
who fears God

25:49.081 --> 25:53.720
should follow him
instead of this pretender,
Henry Tudor.

25:54.120 --> 25:57.824
To Prince Richard,
the Duke of York,

25:58.691 --> 26:00.927
and rightful
King of England!

26:04.831 --> 26:07.967
You came here to destroy
your own grandson's day.

26:10.703 --> 26:12.872
*

26:13.272 --> 26:15.007
You are not my mother.

26:18.144 --> 26:19.946
*

26:44.136 --> 26:48.274
All you have achieved is
the removal of any doubt
that you are mad.

26:50.743 --> 26:53.312
All of England is
now quite sure of it.

26:54.080 --> 26:57.349
The only madness is
that your son remains
on the throne.

26:59.686 --> 27:01.253
But the true King
will prevail.

27:02.689 --> 27:05.091
Your sister-in-law,
every bit as mad as you,

27:05.191 --> 27:07.293
harbors another pretender.

27:08.695 --> 27:10.697
We will deal with him
as we did the last.

27:10.763 --> 27:14.901
My son, Richard,
made me a promise

27:15.001 --> 27:16.903
when I sent him away
to safety.

27:18.004 --> 27:20.707
He swore that he would
avenge his brother.

27:22.174 --> 27:23.876
That vengeance
is coming.

27:24.811 --> 27:27.947
And it is you, Margaret,
who shall be dealt with.

27:39.726 --> 27:43.863
God makes you sick
as punishment
for your lies.

27:45.732 --> 27:48.300
You will have much
to confess to him.

27:49.736 --> 27:51.337
I do not fear death...

27:52.972 --> 27:54.140
Or judgment.

27:56.075 --> 28:00.813
I have done my duty
to God, and he will
reunite me with my Edward.

28:03.816 --> 28:05.985
But there is fear
in your eyes.

28:08.187 --> 28:11.023
What will you say to God
when you see him?

28:12.024 --> 28:16.028
How will you explain all
that blood on your hands?

28:26.238 --> 28:29.776
Take her to the abbey
and put her somewhere
she cannot write.

28:36.849 --> 28:38.317
I am so pleased you
could join us, cousin.

28:43.289 --> 28:44.590
Um...

28:45.457 --> 28:49.428
Perhaps you can
recall our times
together as children?

28:51.530 --> 28:55.401
My apologies, but though
we are cousins, I'm afraid
we've never met before.

28:55.868 --> 28:59.238
Our mothers were
not exactly friends
and our fathers...

29:00.239 --> 29:01.407
Well.

29:01.808 --> 29:03.175
They were not
always brotherly.

29:04.443 --> 29:05.477
I meant...

29:06.913 --> 29:09.982
We spent our childhood
amongst the same people.

29:11.383 --> 29:12.852
We will have
stories in common.

29:13.452 --> 29:14.520
Of course.

29:15.621 --> 29:17.824
Tell us a story
of the Prince, Maggie.

29:22.829 --> 29:23.830
Uh...

29:24.831 --> 29:25.932
I did hear of...

29:26.999 --> 29:28.467
Um, once,

29:29.135 --> 29:31.037
you and your
brother Edward

29:31.838 --> 29:33.239
caught a fox
in the grounds,

29:33.339 --> 29:35.441
and sneaked it
into the nursery.

29:37.043 --> 29:40.512
- Oh, yes that's right.
I had forgotten.

29:41.347 --> 29:43.682
I remember being
terrified of the beast,

29:43.850 --> 29:45.852
but I was desperate
to impress my brother.

29:46.085 --> 29:48.855
Edward didn't care,
he carried it under
his coat

29:48.921 --> 29:50.322
and snuck it
past our maid.

29:51.390 --> 29:52.859
I, I forget the maid.

29:53.359 --> 29:54.426
What was her name?

29:58.464 --> 29:59.498
Mary.

30:01.800 --> 30:04.636
For me she was not
so easy to forget.

30:05.137 --> 30:07.039
She was
particularly fair.

30:12.544 --> 30:14.947
Christmas was my
favorite time to visit.

30:16.648 --> 30:19.251
We used to gather
around, sing.

30:20.086 --> 30:22.721
Oh, on one occasion even
the servants joined in.

30:22.821 --> 30:24.290
An evening
I recall well.

30:26.558 --> 30:30.496
Forgive me, My Lord
but you agreed that
we have never met.

30:35.834 --> 30:37.236
I was watching
from the balcony.

30:38.604 --> 30:41.640
I was rather a shy child
and it became my favorite
place to hide.

30:42.074 --> 30:44.843
I could watch everything
that went on without
having to involve myself.

30:51.217 --> 30:53.452
It was the first
Christmas after
your father died.

30:54.286 --> 30:58.190
Everyone was trying to make
it as happy as it could be
for you and your brother.

31:01.560 --> 31:02.929
You were so brave.

31:04.396 --> 31:07.366
From my hiding place,
I watched when you and Teddy
thought you were alone.

31:09.735 --> 31:12.538
You held him as he wept
and told him everything
would be well.

31:16.943 --> 31:18.277
That is not my memory.

31:21.948 --> 31:23.950
I know what
you will say to Henry.

31:24.516 --> 31:26.685
So play your charade
for now if you must.

31:27.119 --> 31:29.188
But when Prince Richard
rises against him,

31:29.288 --> 31:32.624
I will call on both
you and your conscience
to join us.

31:44.536 --> 31:46.138
Richard has been exiled.

31:47.506 --> 31:49.375
And England is in darkness.

31:50.609 --> 31:52.478
There is much
still to be done.

31:52.744 --> 31:55.982
Let no-one be in
doubt about the task
that lies ahead of us.

31:57.283 --> 32:00.586
But here today,
at last, we have
much to celebrate.

32:00.686 --> 32:04.723
My beloved Richard
and Cathy Gordon
are to be married!

32:14.133 --> 32:15.367
I suppose we should have
guessed she would have

32:15.467 --> 32:16.768
something like this
up her sleeve.

32:18.070 --> 32:20.406
Let's hope King James
is better than his cousin,
Lady Gordon,

32:20.506 --> 32:22.108
at spotting
a peasant in silk.

32:25.011 --> 32:26.012
Excuse me.

32:32.451 --> 32:33.719
Goodnight, my loves.

32:34.620 --> 32:36.088
Remember to
say your prayers.

32:36.555 --> 32:38.624
I will.
For you and Father.

32:38.724 --> 32:40.459
And My Lady,
the King's Mother.

32:40.792 --> 32:42.361
Your grandmother
will be pleased.

32:42.794 --> 32:44.196
I will pray for
your mother too.

32:44.530 --> 32:46.332
Is she unwell?
She is mad.

32:46.432 --> 32:48.867
I heard Lord Strange
say so.

32:49.235 --> 32:52.304
I never want to hear
you say that again.
Do you understand?

32:53.739 --> 32:55.241
Time for bed. Now.

32:59.278 --> 33:00.512
Is she unwell, mother?

33:03.449 --> 33:04.516
She is.

33:06.818 --> 33:08.220
Sleep well,
my sweet boy.

33:27.139 --> 33:29.075
Lies are all
my mother has,
Henry.

33:31.077 --> 33:32.178
No one
will believe her.

33:34.146 --> 33:37.083
England loves you.
We have had
seven years of peace.

33:37.183 --> 33:38.184
And you?

33:40.519 --> 33:41.553
Do you love me?

33:45.091 --> 33:47.093
You are God's King.

33:50.396 --> 33:52.098
You are England's King.

33:58.370 --> 33:59.538
And you are my King.

34:06.745 --> 34:08.280
I will sleep alone tonight.

34:50.856 --> 34:52.158
Leave me.

35:24.823 --> 35:26.725
A blessed end
to us bequeath.

35:27.393 --> 35:31.029
Into thine hands
our souls receive.

35:50.749 --> 35:51.817
Margaret?

35:58.424 --> 35:59.491
What is wrong?

36:01.293 --> 36:02.661
I... I couldn't sleep.

36:04.530 --> 36:06.232
Something is wrong.
Tell me.

36:08.234 --> 36:10.236
Perhaps I can
share your burden.

36:11.237 --> 36:12.238
Is it Henry?

36:16.708 --> 36:17.743
Is it Elizabeth?

36:19.278 --> 36:22.113
What has she said to you?
She is deranged.
You said so yourself.

36:22.314 --> 36:23.449
One of them got away.

36:25.317 --> 36:26.318
What?

36:26.952 --> 36:28.920
The princes.
One of them got away.

36:32.391 --> 36:33.459
"Got away?"

36:33.559 --> 36:37.095
Elizabeth told my physician,
Doctor Lewis, years ago.

36:37.563 --> 36:41.333
She said, "If you had two
precious jewels, would you
put them in the same box?"

36:43.269 --> 36:46.438
Don't you see?
She swapped one
of the princes.

36:46.538 --> 36:48.440
What she said is true.

36:52.644 --> 36:53.745
"Got away?"

36:55.347 --> 36:56.448
From what?

36:57.649 --> 36:58.617
Margaret?

37:01.287 --> 37:02.354
From who?

37:03.555 --> 37:04.623
From a murderer?

37:09.328 --> 37:11.763
It is not murder
if it is God's will.

37:14.300 --> 37:16.402
It was you!
You killed them.
No, I...

37:16.502 --> 37:18.003
I did not!
You ordered it.

37:18.103 --> 37:20.906
I cannot know for certain
if it was carried out.

37:23.309 --> 37:24.510
They were Yorks.

37:24.876 --> 37:26.512
They were children.

37:29.615 --> 37:30.882
It was God's will.

37:30.982 --> 37:32.651
God's will?

37:35.321 --> 37:37.022
There is no divinity
in this.

37:42.594 --> 37:43.862
Will you tell him?

37:52.538 --> 37:53.805
I must think.

37:56.942 --> 37:58.344
Jasper...

38:00.779 --> 38:02.481
He would not understand.

38:06.818 --> 38:08.854
You know he could
never forgive you.

38:11.357 --> 38:14.426
Even now you think
only of yourself.

38:14.526 --> 38:16.562
No, Jasper,
how can you
say that of me?

38:16.862 --> 38:20.466
To know this would
destroy Henry.

38:20.566 --> 38:22.601
It would ruin our boy.

38:24.970 --> 38:26.805
If Henry is to be ruined...

38:29.040 --> 38:31.076
It'll be by your actions,

38:33.745 --> 38:35.381
not my telling of them.

38:52.598 --> 38:55.501
You see?
She cannot
catch him out.

38:55.601 --> 38:58.069
She cannot deny
that Richard is her cousin.

38:58.604 --> 39:01.206
And if he is,
what happens
to him next?

39:01.873 --> 39:03.742
He takes back
the throne of England.

39:04.676 --> 39:05.711
Or?

39:08.013 --> 39:11.116
Are you suggesting
that we leave
Henry Tudor be?

39:11.450 --> 39:15.421
That we allow him to rule
while Richard is denied
his birthright?

39:17.022 --> 39:20.659
I am fighting hard
to win him allies, but
we are just beginning.

39:20.759 --> 39:22.494
Or, he dies.

39:23.429 --> 39:25.697
This is not the
beginning of anything.

39:26.865 --> 39:30.001
It's the continuation
of a conflict that

39:31.169 --> 39:34.039
has claimed
all of my sons.

39:49.688 --> 39:52.991
Lady Grandmother.
Has the party ended?

39:53.091 --> 39:54.125
No.

39:55.894 --> 40:00.732
Your aunt will revel
in her success until dawn.

40:14.713 --> 40:15.947
Are you ill,
Grandmother?

40:17.883 --> 40:19.117
No.

40:20.719 --> 40:22.754
Aren't you happy
about the betrothal?

40:25.557 --> 40:29.461
A betrothal
means a marriage,

40:29.561 --> 40:31.830
and this marriage
means war.

40:35.667 --> 40:37.135
He is my grandson.

40:39.437 --> 40:41.507
How can I be happy
about that?

40:51.216 --> 40:52.818
Oh, Maggie.

41:05.797 --> 41:07.365
You were sleeping
when I came to bed.

41:07.599 --> 41:08.767
I didn't want
to wake you.

41:09.000 --> 41:10.536
You stayed up late then?

41:10.602 --> 41:12.203
I received a letter
from the King.

41:12.738 --> 41:14.806
So while the Duchess
and her friends
enjoyed their revelry,

41:14.906 --> 41:17.008
I made good use of it
and went about
the King's business.

41:17.676 --> 41:19.077
We must leave today.

41:19.177 --> 41:22.113
I've written to the King
of the boy's betrothal
to the Scottish girl.

41:25.551 --> 41:27.619
But at least we will
bring good news
when we return.

41:31.890 --> 41:32.891
What is it, Maggie?

41:36.227 --> 41:39.598
My grandmother.
She believes
the boy is Richard.

41:40.265 --> 41:42.200
You cannot be surprised
that she would say that.

41:42.734 --> 41:44.736
It's not simply
that she says it.

41:46.137 --> 41:48.039
She believes it,
in her heart.

41:49.608 --> 41:50.609
And you?

41:53.579 --> 41:55.947
He knew about Teddy
and me that Christmas.

41:58.917 --> 42:00.218
How would it be
if there had been

42:00.318 --> 42:03.755
someone on the stairs
who saw you,
and they had told him.

42:03.855 --> 42:07.192
Would that not enable him
to repeat the story as though
he himself had seen it?

42:12.330 --> 42:14.332
And if your father
had just died,

42:14.966 --> 42:17.803
surely one could
guess that you would
weep at Christmas?

42:20.305 --> 42:24.175
He is an imposter.
A clever one,
I do not deny that.

42:25.811 --> 42:26.845
Maggie.

42:28.413 --> 42:30.015
I know that there is
a part of your heart

42:30.115 --> 42:31.917
that would want
your cousin to have lived.

42:33.652 --> 42:36.287
But you must think
about the implications.

42:37.322 --> 42:40.626
This boy is an imposter.

42:43.795 --> 42:45.731
I must make plans
for our return.

43:30.108 --> 43:31.376
Why is Jasper absent?

43:31.677 --> 43:32.678
He is unwell.

43:34.445 --> 43:36.081
We are told
we must not worry.

43:36.848 --> 43:38.516
The Duchess has
revealed her plans.

43:38.684 --> 43:41.853
She hopes to win
the Scottish army
to his cause.

43:43.288 --> 43:44.990
There is no
certainty of that.

43:45.691 --> 43:47.292
Or even any
great likelihood.

43:48.894 --> 43:51.863
If Cathy Gordon was
the highest born bride
that she could buy for him,

43:51.963 --> 43:56.334
then Europe is little more
convinced of his identity
than we are.

43:56.434 --> 43:58.269
The girl is
just a minor noble.

43:58.704 --> 44:00.338
If his claim is believed,
you'd expect

44:00.438 --> 44:03.208
he'd win at least
a French princess,
if not a Spanish one.

44:03.408 --> 44:05.043
And Scotland is too
poor to start a war.

44:06.311 --> 44:07.913
The Duchess may
just be taunting you.

44:08.513 --> 44:10.982
I will discuss it
with my uncle when
he is recovered.

44:25.831 --> 44:28.266
All you must do
is confirm that
the boy is a fraud.

44:30.969 --> 44:34.105
We are safe, Maggie.
I promise you.

44:43.949 --> 44:47.085
Sir Richard,
Lady Margaret Pole.
We welcome your return.

44:53.558 --> 44:57.829
Your Grace.
Our mission to Burgundy
has proven fruitful.

44:58.997 --> 45:01.132
You questioned the boy
as I asked, My Lady?

45:05.036 --> 45:06.104
Yes, Your Grace.

45:07.238 --> 45:08.273
And?

45:10.541 --> 45:13.078
Did you recognize
him as your blood?

45:13.411 --> 45:14.980
Is he Richard of York?

45:19.785 --> 45:22.821
He is not a man
whom I have ever
seen before.

45:29.027 --> 45:30.962
He is an imposter then?

45:31.863 --> 45:33.799
Not your cousin?
Not Prince Richard?

45:47.412 --> 45:48.479
No, Your Grace.

45:54.252 --> 45:55.386
Is this the evidence?

45:55.486 --> 45:56.454
Yes, Your Grace.

45:57.956 --> 45:59.024
Sir Pole...

46:00.058 --> 46:02.660
Brought home
the wax seals

46:02.828 --> 46:07.098
of every traitor who has
written to the Duchess
pledging fealty to the boy.

46:11.336 --> 46:13.839
Proof of treachery
from their own hands.

46:29.988 --> 46:31.156
Sir Boswell.

46:32.490 --> 46:34.092
- Traitor.
- Take him.

46:48.139 --> 46:49.407
Lord Smithson.

47:05.156 --> 47:06.191
Dorley.

47:18.369 --> 47:22.040
Elizabeth, Dowager Queen.

47:51.970 --> 47:53.404
- Sir William Stanley.

47:57.408 --> 47:58.409
No.

47:59.410 --> 48:02.347
It's a lie.
Surely, brother?

48:04.282 --> 48:05.616
I am loyal...

48:06.985 --> 48:08.386
To the rightful king!

48:10.488 --> 48:13.124
- Richard of York!

48:25.570 --> 48:26.804
What will you do with her?

48:27.238 --> 48:29.274
Your mother's treachery
is old news.

48:29.975 --> 48:32.277
And God will take her soon
enough without my help.

48:33.711 --> 48:35.680
And William Stanley?
And the others?

48:36.247 --> 48:37.615
You know what I must do.

48:37.983 --> 48:39.184
And you must do it.

48:41.119 --> 48:42.453
If they have lied to you.

48:45.356 --> 48:48.559
Your Grace?
Your uncle wishes
to speak with you.

48:50.295 --> 48:51.562
He is recovered?

48:51.662 --> 48:54.632
No your Grace,
but he is very...

48:54.732 --> 48:57.602
The King has
pressing matters to
concern himself with.

48:59.004 --> 49:00.338
I will see to his uncle.

49:07.312 --> 49:09.014
Tell him I will
see him presently.

49:23.028 --> 49:24.029
Jasper.

49:34.405 --> 49:35.540
Leave me, Margaret.

49:38.043 --> 49:39.744
I would speak
only with Henry.

49:43.081 --> 49:45.116
What is it that
you wish to tell him?

49:47.152 --> 49:49.054
That is between me
and my King.

49:55.293 --> 49:57.195
You will destroy him,
Jasper.

50:00.131 --> 50:03.301
You will destroy everything
we have worked for.

50:07.004 --> 50:08.406
Oh! Oh!

50:20.518 --> 50:22.320
We have offended God.

50:28.559 --> 50:31.162
Did you not love
me once, Jasper?

50:36.201 --> 50:38.303
I have never loved
anyone else.
Oh!

50:42.073 --> 50:43.174
But this?

50:46.444 --> 50:48.413
Did I love you...

50:50.081 --> 50:52.483
Without ever knowing...

50:53.784 --> 50:56.187
Who you truly were?

50:58.523 --> 51:00.125
Henry needs to know...

51:01.726 --> 51:03.428
What is done in his name.

51:05.696 --> 51:09.267
Or he will
execute traitors...

51:11.536 --> 51:12.670
...while...

51:14.139 --> 51:18.343
The greatest of all
remains at his side.

51:23.581 --> 51:25.283
Poor, poor Jasper.

51:29.187 --> 51:31.322
I have loved only you...

51:33.358 --> 51:36.161
And yet I have
caused you such pain.

51:54.312 --> 51:56.647
Help me, Lord, please.

51:58.783 --> 52:00.651
Help me. God!

52:03.954 --> 52:05.656
God would not
want you to suffer.

52:05.756 --> 52:07.392
God, help me.

53:16.694 --> 53:18.663
*
