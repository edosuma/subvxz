05:27.107 --> 05:29.775
He was a lonely, very unhappy man,

been bad for my mother

it was his own fault.

just blame it on the kid

Your coat's hanging out

They pull people over
for things like that?

31:32.922 --> 31:36.257
Well, it's blocking your license plate.

I just left you this morning.

34:29.899 --> 34:31.498
Okay.

You need to know why I cut
off contact with my mom.

34:55.324 --> 34:58.292
I-I think Norman is sick.

34:58.394 --> 35:00.360
I know he's sick, Dylan.

No, no, it's... it's worse
than you can imagine, trust me.

35:03.065 --> 35:04.865
He...

35:04.967 --> 35:06.967
He gets really angry sometimes,
and it's... it's like

35:07.069 --> 35:08.635
when he's in... When he's in that place,

35:08.737 --> 35:10.437
it's like he's filled
with this rage, right?

35:10.539 --> 35:13.607
And it's like he could do anything.

35:13.709 --> 35:15.909
What do you mean by "anything"?

35:16.011 --> 35:17.811
Things happen around him.

35:19.148 --> 35:21.315
Bad things.

35:21.417 --> 35:22.649

35:25.855 --> 35:29.423
Like your teacher, Blaire Watson.

35:29.525 --> 35:32.326
Norman was with her the
night she was killed.

35:32.428 --> 35:34.428
He was a suspect, and they had him take

35:34.530 --> 35:37.898
a lie detector test, and he
passed, but something just...

35:38.000 --> 35:42.102
Something really never seemed right.

35:42.204 --> 35:46.907
This is gonna sound
really crazy, Emma, but...

35:47.009 --> 35:50.144
Norma told me that
Norman killed his dad.

35:51.914 --> 35:54.014
What?

35:54.116 --> 35:56.950
Sam was... He was a really bad guy.

35:57.052 --> 35:58.652
I mean, he used to beat
the shit out of my mom

35:58.754 --> 36:00.587
all the time, and I... I don't know.

36:00.689 --> 36:02.623
I... I think that Norman
was trying to protect her,

36:02.725 --> 36:04.958
but I don't know exactly what happened.

36:05.060 --> 36:06.527
I mean, she tried to cover it up.

36:06.629 --> 36:08.529
She said that he didn't mean
to. You know how she is.

36:08.631 --> 36:10.931
She'd... she'd do anything
for him, even ignore

36:11.033 --> 36:13.500
the fact that he's...

36:16.906 --> 36:19.273
But then he went into Pineview,
and, you know, I thought that...

36:19.375 --> 36:21.141
I thought that maybe
everything would be okay

36:21.243 --> 36:24.611
and he'd be safe and I could
stop worrying all the time.

36:24.713 --> 36:29.349
Because... I felt like
I was going crazy, Emma.

36:29.451 --> 36:32.886
He's... he's my brother. He's Norman.

36:32.988 --> 36:34.454
And then Norma let him come home,

36:34.557 --> 36:37.491
and I realized that he wasn't okay.

36:40.963 --> 36:43.964
And then you found this.

36:44.066 --> 36:45.832
Your mom's earring?

<i>[somber music]</i>

36:50.072 --> 36:51.205
No, Em.

36:53.275 --> 36:56.343
It's your mom's earring.

36:58.480 --> 37:03.250
Norma kept it. I don't know why.

37:03.352 --> 37:06.253
So... so what? She...
she left it at the motel

37:06.355 --> 37:08.422
when she was there?

37:08.524 --> 37:10.224
Probably.

37:10.326 --> 37:11.892
"Probably," why probably?
Why didn't you just

37:11.994 --> 37:13.694
tell me it was hers?

37:13.796 --> 37:16.863
Because I was worried that
Norman did something to her.

37:16.966 --> 37:18.765
What are you talking about?

37:18.867 --> 37:21.201
I don't know, Emma, because
I... I thought that I was

37:21.303 --> 37:23.937
being paranoid and...
But your mom stayed

37:24.039 --> 37:27.741
at the motel, and Norma left Norman

37:27.843 --> 37:30.410
alone with her, and...
And now we can't find her

37:30.512 --> 37:33.247
and she never checked out.

37:36.518 --> 37:38.619
My God, this is insane.

37:42.375 --> 37:43.875
S-so you're saying that
Norman hurt my mom?

37:43.977 --> 37:45.276
I don't know, Emma.

37:45.378 --> 37:47.011
That's why I never said anything.

37:47.113 --> 37:48.446
Well, you should've told
me! Why didn't you tell me?

37:48.548 --> 37:49.780
Because I didn't have any proof!

37:49.883 --> 37:51.115
[baby crying]

37:51.217 --> 37:52.817
Okay? I-I-I didn't say anything

37:52.919 --> 37:54.652
because I didn't... I
didn't know, all right?

37:54.754 --> 37:57.121
I... I asked Norma, and... and
she said that she couldn't deal,

37:57.223 --> 37:58.856
that it would break her,
and so I left, all right?

37:58.958 --> 38:01.192
I was a coward, and I left
because I wanted to be with you.

38:01.294 --> 38:03.294
- [baby crying]
- I need to go get her.

38:03.396 --> 38:04.529
No, let me get her. I'll...

38:04.631 --> 38:06.130
No, no, you need... You need to get out.

38:06.232 --> 38:07.899
You need to leave. You
need to go and take a walk

38:08.001 --> 38:09.534
because if you stay here,
I'm gonna start screaming,
