00:02.169 --> 00:03.462
Previously on Gilmore Girls:

00:03.504 --> 00:05.005
- I'm going in.
- You can't.

00:05.088 --> 00:06.798
- I'm going in.
- It's Thursday afternoon.

00:06.840 --> 00:08.634
- I know.
- He works on Thursday afternoons.

00:08.717 --> 00:09.760
Oh, my God!

00:09.843 --> 00:11.053
You're getting back with Dean!

00:11.136 --> 00:13.305
- You know what these are?
- They look like tickets.

00:13.388 --> 00:14.389
To P.J. Harvey.

00:14.473 --> 00:15.474
I can't date you, Tristin.

00:15.557 --> 00:18.185
- Have you seen Luke around?
- He's probably at the diner.

00:18.268 --> 00:21.063
He was supposed to be at the diner,
but he's not.

00:21.355 --> 00:23.815
We were supposed to meet for lunch,
but he didn't show.

00:23.899 --> 00:26.485
You have almost no free time
with your work at the diner.

00:26.568 --> 00:29.530
And lately,
every spare moment has been spent...

00:29.613 --> 00:31.365
- not with Rachel.
- That's not true.

00:31.448 --> 00:33.158
- Who are you going with?
- Rory.

00:33.200 --> 00:35.160
- What?
- Rory's going out with you?

00:35.244 --> 00:36.245
Yes, she is.

00:36.537 --> 00:38.580
But recently, he's been...

00:38.664 --> 00:41.834
Other places, your place, actually.

00:42.000 --> 00:44.086
- I think I'm hiding.
- I think you are, too.

00:44.169 --> 00:46.296
It's just a little weird
having her in my place.

00:46.380 --> 00:49.049
- I thought that's what you wanted.
- It was... Is.

00:49.132 --> 00:51.385
Max Medina, this is Luke Danes.

00:51.468 --> 00:53.595
Luke owns the diner.
He has the greatest coffee.

00:53.679 --> 00:55.013
I'm not going to P.J. Harvey.

00:55.055 --> 00:57.224
- Tristin says you are.
- Then he lied.

00:57.307 --> 00:58.433
I saw the tickets.

00:58.517 --> 01:01.645
I just left my toolbox
from when I was here earlier, fixing things.

01:01.728 --> 01:04.105
I do a lot of little things
around here for Lorelai.

01:04.188 --> 01:05.357
Rachel, no.

01:05.440 --> 01:08.235
She and I are just friends.
I told you that a thousand times.

01:08.318 --> 01:11.822
We can't keep getting this close
to have something derail us again.

01:11.905 --> 01:14.700
There's only one thing I could think of
that could solve it.

01:14.783 --> 01:18.328
Break up. I'm not interested
in a murder-suicide kind of thing.

01:18.412 --> 01:20.330
We should get married.

01:20.414 --> 01:21.498
Dean?

01:25.127 --> 01:26.420
- I feel like an idiot.
- Why?

01:26.545 --> 01:28.881
I come all the way out here,
and I see you with him!

01:28.964 --> 01:31.341
A proposal has to be something more...

01:31.425 --> 01:34.178
than the desperate desire
to end a bickering match.

01:34.261 --> 01:37.097
- It was more than that.
- It has to be planned.

01:37.181 --> 01:39.057
It should be magical.

01:39.099 --> 01:41.560
There should be
a thousand yellow daisies.

01:41.643 --> 01:42.895
- Dean.
- What?

01:42.978 --> 01:44.563
- Stop!
- Why?

01:46.273 --> 01:47.983
Because I love you, you idiot.

01:48.066 --> 01:50.903
Not 1,001, not 999, but 1,000.

01:51.111 --> 01:53.238
I don't question the orders.
I merely fill them.

01:53.322 --> 01:54.698
I don't want an answer now.

01:54.781 --> 01:57.659
I've thought about this.
I want you to do the same.

01:58.368 --> 02:00.245
I love you, Lorelai Gilmore.

02:00.329 --> 02:01.872
Oh, my.

02:03.000 --> 02:09.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:28.649 --> 02:29.983
You should get married in Italy.

02:30.067 --> 02:31.985
All the way from home, the same topic.

02:32.069 --> 02:33.987
There's tons of stuff going on in the world.

02:34.071 --> 02:35.113
- Like?
- Balkans.

02:35.197 --> 02:36.907
That was ages ago. Read a paper.

02:36.990 --> 02:38.534
They make my hands black.

02:38.617 --> 02:41.411
You should walk down the aisle
to Frank Sinatra...

02:41.495 --> 02:44.039
with a huge bouquet of something
that smells really good.

02:44.122 --> 02:45.123
Pot roast.

02:45.207 --> 02:47.209
You should wear a long veil
with your hair up.

02:47.292 --> 02:49.753
I'll take any other subject in the world
for $200, Alex.

02:49.837 --> 02:51.421
Why don't you wanna think about this?

02:51.505 --> 02:54.091
I haven't made my mind up
about the 'yes' or 'no' part...

02:54.174 --> 02:57.135
so I don't want to start fantasizing
about dresses and flowers...

02:57.219 --> 03:00.138
or doves and tulle until I do.
So please change the subject.

03:00.556 --> 03:02.808
The bridesmaids should pick
their own dresses.

03:02.850 --> 03:04.393
You know how in All in the Family...

03:04.476 --> 03:06.270
Edith would be yapping about something...

03:06.353 --> 03:08.981
and Archie would pretend to hang
or shoot himself?

03:09.064 --> 03:11.233
Something about this moment
made me think of that.

03:11.316 --> 03:14.695
- Fine, I'm done. I'm taking these to Lane.
- Okay. Meet me at Luke's.

03:14.778 --> 03:17.322
- Get me a paper, please.
- But my hands.

04:18.091 --> 04:20.761
- No. No more talking.
- But, Mama, please.

04:20.844 --> 04:23.347
Not for you to think about.
All under control.

04:23.430 --> 04:24.515
Give me a hint.

04:24.598 --> 04:27.476
Children will know what their parents
think they can handle.

04:27.559 --> 04:30.354
- I'm sorry, was that the hint?
- Back to work.

04:37.110 --> 04:39.071
I came to bring you
some of my mom's flowers.

04:39.112 --> 04:40.113
Thanks.

04:40.197 --> 04:42.533
- Are you okay?
- No. I'm not okay.

04:42.616 --> 04:45.327
What's wrong?
Did she find your CD burner?

04:45.410 --> 04:49.331
My parents are sending me to Korea
for the summer to visit my cousins.

04:49.832 --> 04:53.085
- So?
- They won't tell me when I'm coming back.

04:53.126 --> 04:55.003
What do you mean they won't tell you?

04:55.087 --> 04:57.506
I mean, they bought me a one-way ticket.

04:57.631 --> 05:00.884
- One-way. The plane goes there and stops.
- Are you sure?

05:00.968 --> 05:02.553
I called the airline to confirm it...

05:02.636 --> 05:05.180
and my parents were in their room
whispering all morning.

05:05.264 --> 05:08.183
When my mother came out,
she looked very happy. She was humming.

05:08.267 --> 05:11.687
I swear, they're planning on sending me
to Korea for the rest of my life.

05:11.770 --> 05:13.480
It's like that Sally Field movie...

05:13.564 --> 05:15.899
where the husband
wouldn't let them return from Iran.

05:15.983 --> 05:17.860
Except, I won't have to
keep my head covered.

05:17.943 --> 05:18.944
Calm down.

05:19.027 --> 05:21.280
Are you listening?
I am being shipped off to Korea.

05:21.363 --> 05:23.615
I think you're freaking out
a little prematurely.

05:23.657 --> 05:26.243
- Really?
- Yes, let's think about this.

05:26.326 --> 05:30.122
Maybe there's some deal with the airline
and that's why the ticket's one-way...

05:30.163 --> 05:33.292
or maybe they haven't worked out
the plans with your cousins yet...

05:33.375 --> 05:37.254
or there's a weather consideration
or a holiday you don't know about...

05:38.255 --> 05:40.465
I'm really going to miss you.

05:40.549 --> 05:43.802
Lane, come here, please.

05:44.052 --> 05:45.554
I have to go.

05:46.847 --> 05:48.640
You've been a good friend.

05:54.771 --> 05:55.981
Hi, Bootsy.

05:56.315 --> 05:59.776
So, apparently,
they shoot a gland from a pig's head...

05:59.818 --> 06:03.447
in Ivana Trump's rear end twice a month
to keep her looking young.

06:03.530 --> 06:05.157
Hope she's not kosher.

06:05.240 --> 06:07.659
I don't know. It doesn't say here.

06:20.214 --> 06:22.174
- Hey.
- What? Nothing.

06:23.509 --> 06:25.344
- You a Leo?
- No.

06:25.469 --> 06:28.305
Thank God.
Those guys are screwed this week.

06:54.122 --> 06:55.123
What're you reading?

06:55.207 --> 06:57.668
God. Do not sneak up on a person
like that.

06:57.918 --> 06:59.503
'InStyle Weddings. 'Very interesting.

06:59.586 --> 07:00.921
No, not very interesting.

07:01.004 --> 07:04.174
- Get any ideas?
- Yes, we should have cake more often.

07:04.258 --> 07:05.801
Hey, Bootsy, I'll take this.

07:05.884 --> 07:08.178
- No, I just...
- That's $6.

07:08.262 --> 07:11.473
- Lorelai, so?
- Hi, Patty.

07:11.557 --> 07:14.309
- InStyle Weddings. You said yes.
- No, not yet.

07:14.393 --> 07:15.978
- She said 'yet. '
- I know.

07:16.061 --> 07:17.104
I'm right here.

07:17.187 --> 07:20.065
- He's a good man?
- Yeah, he's a great man.

07:20.107 --> 07:23.569
I just love this. Have you told Luke?

07:23.652 --> 07:25.904
No, it just happened last night.

07:26.488 --> 07:28.907
Patty, stop it. I'll tell him.

07:28.949 --> 07:31.034
It's not that big a deal if he just finds out.

07:31.118 --> 07:32.452
Whatever you say.

07:32.536 --> 07:36.290
It just so happens we are on our way
over there to have breakfast...

07:36.373 --> 07:38.041
- and I'll tell Luke then.
- Be gentle.

07:38.125 --> 07:39.209
Patty, Luke and I are...

07:39.293 --> 07:42.504
Just friends. Yes, I know.

07:42.588 --> 07:45.174
- It's true.
- Okay, let's go.

07:47.509 --> 07:49.136
- It is.
- I know.

07:50.345 --> 07:53.015
What is with this place?
Why will nobody believe me?

07:53.098 --> 07:54.641
- They believe you.
- No, they don't.

07:54.725 --> 07:56.560
I promise they believe you.

07:56.810 --> 07:59.271
- You are pacifying me.
- Just a little.

07:59.313 --> 08:02.024
- I don't like it.
- I'll see if I can stop.

08:18.332 --> 08:21.251
I can't wait for the movie theater
to reopen.

08:28.217 --> 08:29.885
Let's see, what looks good?

08:29.968 --> 08:33.804
I'm so unbelievably hungry, I'll have
to order breakfast and lunch. Crazy.

08:33.847 --> 08:35.974
- Mom, go tell him.
- I will.

08:36.058 --> 08:37.433
- Now.
- Why?

08:37.518 --> 08:41.355
Because in five minutes, someone's about
to be pushed through that window.

08:41.438 --> 08:43.065
This is crazy.

08:43.148 --> 08:45.526
Why is everybody making
such a big deal about this?

08:45.609 --> 08:47.986
Because everyone knows
that Luke has a thing for you.

08:48.070 --> 08:50.072
- Luke does not have a thing for me.
- Tell him.

08:50.155 --> 08:53.575
We can barely have a conversation
without biting each other's heads off.

08:53.659 --> 08:55.702
- Tell him.
- Everything about me repulses him...

08:55.786 --> 08:57.371
my coffee-drinking, my eating habits.

08:57.454 --> 09:00.499
Remember when I called him
Ranger Bob last week? He hated that.

09:00.582 --> 09:02.417
Will you get me a muffin
when you're there?

09:02.501 --> 09:03.961
Okay. God. Fine.

09:11.051 --> 09:12.052
Hey.

09:12.135 --> 09:13.929
Fresh coffee will be ready in a minute...

09:14.012 --> 09:16.640
unless you want to just roll up a dollar bill
and go nuts.

09:16.723 --> 09:18.350
No, thanks, I can wait.

09:19.017 --> 09:22.062
- What the helI's going on with them?
- I don't know.

09:22.187 --> 09:24.857
Crazy people.
The whole town should be medicated...

09:24.898 --> 09:28.694
and put in a rec room
with Ping-Pong tables and hand puppets.

09:30.487 --> 09:31.697
What?

09:32.030 --> 09:33.574
Nothing. I...

09:34.908 --> 09:36.785
I have something to tell you.

09:36.869 --> 09:38.787
I have something
to share with you, actually.

09:38.871 --> 09:40.164
- Share with me?
- Yes.

09:40.205 --> 09:42.124
When exciting things happen in your life...

09:42.207 --> 09:43.667
you wanna share them with people...

09:43.750 --> 09:45.502
who you think will find them exciting...

09:45.586 --> 09:47.087
- which I think you will.
- What is it?

09:47.171 --> 09:48.463
It's very...

09:48.547 --> 09:51.508
Exciting, I heard. I'm prepared
to jump up and down if necessary.

09:51.592 --> 09:53.552
Okay, then, here it is.

09:55.596 --> 09:57.890
Max has asked me to marry him.

10:00.184 --> 10:01.810
Yeah, I figured.

10:02.436 --> 10:04.021
- You did?
- It was obvious.

10:04.104 --> 10:06.815
You two were getting kind of close,
he was around a lot.

10:06.899 --> 10:11.236
Then last night
with that life-changing-thing comment...

10:11.320 --> 10:14.239
I put two and two together
and figured it out.

10:15.240 --> 10:17.659
- Congratulations, by the way.
- Thank you.

10:17.743 --> 10:20.996
- Have you set a date?
- No, I haven't answered him yet.

10:21.079 --> 10:23.332
- You're going to say yes.
- How do you know?

10:23.415 --> 10:25.918
You're making a big deal
about telling me he proposed.

10:26.001 --> 10:27.544
I don't think I'm making a big deal.

10:27.628 --> 10:29.963
You wouldn't do that
if you weren't going to say yes.

10:30.047 --> 10:32.799
I'm sharing something with you.
It is not making a big deal.

10:32.883 --> 10:34.718
Sharing is a nice gesture...

10:34.801 --> 10:36.929
like when you're a kid
and you have a Popsicle...

10:36.970 --> 10:39.515
and you break it in two
and offer half to another kid.

10:39.598 --> 10:41.558
That's sharing. That is what I'm doing.

10:41.642 --> 10:44.228
- You offered me half a Popsicle?
- Yes.

10:45.437 --> 10:48.065
- Okay, so, now you know.
- Now I know.

10:51.777 --> 10:54.321
I'll have two blueberry muffins
and some coffee.

10:54.404 --> 10:56.323
- Coming right up.
- Okay.

10:58.617 --> 11:00.285
I think it's good you're doing this.

11:00.327 --> 11:02.162
You do? Good. Me, too.

11:02.246 --> 11:05.499
Not that I'm definitely doing it,
but if I do, then it'll be good.

11:05.582 --> 11:06.792
Where are you going to live?

11:06.834 --> 11:08.418
- What?
- Here? Hartford?

11:08.502 --> 11:11.004
Here. I don't know.
We haven't talked about it.

11:11.088 --> 11:13.423
Hartford's probably good,
closer to Rory's school.

11:13.507 --> 11:16.593
- Yeah, I guess.
- Of course, it is a little far from the Inn.

11:17.219 --> 11:18.428
Yeah.

11:18.512 --> 11:21.807
But who knows how long you'll work
after you're married.

11:21.849 --> 11:22.850
Excuse me?

11:22.933 --> 11:24.726
But you probably already
talked about that?

11:24.810 --> 11:27.563
No, but I think he and my father
have come to an agreement...

11:27.646 --> 11:29.106
on how many goats I'm worth.

11:29.147 --> 11:31.817
I'm just talking here. It's great, really.

11:33.026 --> 11:34.903
- You're going to have more kids?
- Personal.

11:34.987 --> 11:37.030
I mean, he wants kids, right?

11:37.114 --> 11:40.576
- In the world? Yes. He wants kids.
- You haven't talked about that either.

11:40.659 --> 11:43.370
What we have and haven't discussed
is none of your business.

11:43.453 --> 11:45.581
Joint checking accounts?
You know his last name?

11:45.664 --> 11:46.915
I want my Popsicle back.

11:46.999 --> 11:49.835
- Fine, it's your business.
- Yes, it's my business.

11:49.918 --> 11:53.422
Some people go their entire lives
without having these conversations.

11:53.505 --> 11:57.301
My parents didn't discuss a thing
my entire childhood, worked fine for them.

11:57.342 --> 12:01.805
But when my mom died, she hadn't
told Dad where the coupon drawer was.

12:01.889 --> 12:04.099
Took him 10 years to find it.

12:04.349 --> 12:06.852
- Used a coffee can the whole time.
- Okay.

12:06.935 --> 12:08.187
I don't care what anyone says.

12:08.228 --> 12:10.314
A coupon can is not as good
as a coupon drawer.

12:10.355 --> 12:11.565
How are those muffins coming?

12:11.648 --> 12:14.776
But you know what? You might
like a coupon can. You never know.

12:14.860 --> 12:17.613
Here you go, two blueberry muffins.

12:18.071 --> 12:19.156
Thank you.

12:19.239 --> 12:21.283
And congratulations again.

12:27.706 --> 12:30.584
- Now what's going on?
- Kirk passed out.

12:31.001 --> 12:33.378
- Here's your muffin.
- Thanks.

12:33.921 --> 12:35.255
How'd he take it?

12:35.547 --> 12:38.133
Fine. He took it fine.

12:48.894 --> 12:52.105
- Is everything okay?
- Yes, I'm just tied to the emergency brake.

12:52.189 --> 12:53.524
How did you do that?

12:53.565 --> 12:56.068
You know,
with a flourish and a big ending.

12:56.109 --> 12:57.861
Okay, I got it. Let's go.

12:58.195 --> 13:01.365
- My coat.
- It's pretty warm out for a coat.

13:01.406 --> 13:04.701
It tends to cool off
the minute I get in that house.

13:04.785 --> 13:06.119
- Are you good?
- I'm good.

13:06.203 --> 13:08.372
- My keys.
- Mom.

13:08.413 --> 13:10.916
They're in the ignition. Okay, I got them.
Let's go.

13:10.999 --> 13:12.751
- What is wrong with you?
- Nothing.

13:12.835 --> 13:13.919
You got lost coming here.

13:14.002 --> 13:15.462
- I took a wrong turn.
- Six times.

13:15.546 --> 13:18.632
My self-preservational instincts at work,
ladies and gentlemen.

13:18.799 --> 13:20.092
And the coat and the keys?

13:20.175 --> 13:21.802
- I got stuff on my mind.
- Max stuff?

13:21.885 --> 13:23.554
- No. Stuff stuff.
- You're lying.

13:23.595 --> 13:25.472
I'm being mysterious.
That's what women do.

13:25.556 --> 13:27.099
- Mom...
- Look. Doorbell. Pretty sound.

13:27.182 --> 13:29.226
You always make me tell you
what I'm thinking.

13:29.268 --> 13:32.604
And the lesson we've learned
is you should never become a spy.

13:32.646 --> 13:34.356
You're here. Richard, they're here.

13:34.439 --> 13:36.275
- Wonderful.
- Come in.

13:36.316 --> 13:38.318
- No.
- Why?

13:38.443 --> 13:40.279
Because you're scaring Rory.

13:40.487 --> 13:45.367
Stop that. Get in here. Scaring Rory.
You're so silly sometimes.

13:46.326 --> 13:49.705
Let's get you a drink. Put your coat down.
And are you hungry?

13:49.788 --> 13:52.082
I had Antonia make some Roquefort puffs.

13:52.166 --> 13:53.876
Antonia, bring the puffs.

13:53.959 --> 13:56.003
Come, sit down. Richard.

13:56.461 --> 13:59.464
- Say nothing until I get there.
- Hurry up.

13:59.506 --> 14:00.674
Mom, what's going on?

14:00.757 --> 14:02.551
The nails.

14:03.010 --> 14:05.470
So, tell me what's new with you girls.

14:05.512 --> 14:07.097
Nothing.

14:07.222 --> 14:10.767
Grandma, what about you?
Did something special happen?

14:11.185 --> 14:13.061
Well, as a matter of fact...

14:13.604 --> 14:16.148
For goodness' sake. Richard, damn it!

14:16.231 --> 14:19.276
Mom, why don't you just tell us
what's happening now?

14:19.359 --> 14:22.404
All right. I can't wait for your grandfather
any longer.

14:22.487 --> 14:24.948
You know I'm very good friends
with Bitty Charleston...

14:25.032 --> 14:26.325
the headmaster's wife.

14:26.408 --> 14:27.951
We have this little arrangement...

14:28.035 --> 14:30.579
where she keeps me apprised
of the goings-on at Chilton.

14:30.662 --> 14:33.624
She tells me all the gossip on the students
and their parents...

14:33.665 --> 14:36.418
and any piece of information
I might find useful.

14:36.502 --> 14:40.839
Well, this afternoon, she called
to tell me the class list just came out...

14:40.881 --> 14:43.926
and Rory has finished
in the top three percent.

14:44.635 --> 14:45.886
I know.

14:46.512 --> 14:49.264
You do? Who do you know at Chilton?

14:50.307 --> 14:51.642
Rory.

14:52.851 --> 14:55.812
It wasn't definite,
but I had a pretty good idea.

14:55.896 --> 14:57.940
Rory, wonderful news...

14:58.023 --> 15:00.442
you finished in the top three percent
of your class.

15:00.526 --> 15:03.320
Yeah, Dad, J. Edgar Hoover over here
was just telling us.

15:03.362 --> 15:04.363
What?

15:04.696 --> 15:06.990
I told you not to say anything
before I got here.

15:07.074 --> 15:09.076
- You took too long.
- No, we already knew.

15:09.159 --> 15:11.370
- It's a simple request.
- Just hang up the phone.

15:11.411 --> 15:13.705
It's good news either way.
Let's all agree on that.

15:13.789 --> 15:15.833
I am immensely proud of you, Rory.

15:15.874 --> 15:17.292
Yes, we knew you could do it.

15:17.376 --> 15:18.752
We certainly did.

15:18.836 --> 15:21.755
We have to celebrate. Next week,
we will have a special dinner.

15:21.839 --> 15:23.674
Grandma, all of your dinners are special.

15:23.715 --> 15:25.133
This one will be extra-special.

15:25.217 --> 15:28.804
We'll make all your favorite foods,
and you can invite some of your friends.

15:28.887 --> 15:31.598
There's an excellent chance
that presents might be involved.

15:31.682 --> 15:33.183
You guys do not have to do this.

15:33.267 --> 15:35.561
- For the top three percent...
- We most certainly do.

15:35.644 --> 15:38.522
You start late, have to catch up,
and by the end of the year...

15:38.564 --> 15:40.774
you've overtaken everyone.
A true Gilmore.

15:40.858 --> 15:42.025
Through and through.

15:42.109 --> 15:43.277
Dinner is ready.

15:43.360 --> 15:45.237
Thank you, Antonia. Shall we?

15:45.904 --> 15:48.073
After the top three percent in her class.

15:48.156 --> 15:50.200
Well, thank you very much.

15:50.284 --> 15:53.996
Just go ahead and start without me.
I've got to check in at the Inn.

15:54.079 --> 15:56.748
MicheI's there by himself.
People could die.

15:56.832 --> 15:58.375
Well, hurry up.

16:04.840 --> 16:06.508
- Hello?
- Where are we going to live?

16:06.592 --> 16:08.552
- Lorelai?
- Where are we going to live?

16:08.594 --> 16:11.054
- Well, I...
- Your house? My house?

16:11.138 --> 16:13.307
- I don't know.
- We have to figure this stuff out.

16:13.390 --> 16:17.102
I have a life and a kid, and both of them
require a house of some sort.

16:17.186 --> 16:20.230
- Okay, but...
- I have stuff. I have a lot of stuff.

16:20.314 --> 16:23.025
You haven't seen my closet yet,
but you would not believe...

16:23.108 --> 16:25.068
the amount of stuff one person
can accumulate.

16:25.152 --> 16:28.280
I don't even know what this stuff is,
but it's there and it's mine...

16:28.363 --> 16:30.490
- and it needs a place to live.
- Well...

16:30.574 --> 16:32.326
- And I want to work.
- What?

16:32.409 --> 16:33.494
And I like my bank.

16:33.577 --> 16:34.578
Okay, hold on...

16:34.620 --> 16:37.080
The teller's name is Margie
and she can't count.

16:37.164 --> 16:40.959
There's something poetic about banking
in a place where the teller can't count.

16:41.001 --> 16:42.252
- Lorelai.
- What?

16:42.336 --> 16:44.796
Calm down. Talk to me.

16:45.964 --> 16:47.424
It's just...

16:50.969 --> 16:54.765
If I die, I want you to know
where the coupon drawer is.

16:55.641 --> 16:58.227
I would like that, too. I think.

16:58.310 --> 17:01.605
Well, we need to figure
these things out before...

17:02.147 --> 17:03.565
Before what?

17:04.566 --> 17:06.568
- Are you saying yes?
- What?

17:06.818 --> 17:08.111
Are you saying yes?

17:08.153 --> 17:09.445
Why are you asking me that?

17:09.488 --> 17:11.781
Because you call me, out of the blue.

17:11.823 --> 17:14.535
You're panicked about
where we're going to live and bank...

17:14.617 --> 17:15.828
and coupon drawers and Margie.

17:15.911 --> 17:18.413
These are important things to discuss.

17:18.497 --> 17:19.790
I agree.

17:19.832 --> 17:24.502
They're extremely important things
to discuss, especially if you're saying yes.

17:25.045 --> 17:26.046
Are you?

17:28.006 --> 17:30.717
I am so thrilled about this.
Will you get a certificate?

17:30.801 --> 17:31.802
I'm not sure.

17:31.885 --> 17:34.346
They should give you
a certificate or a plaque.

17:34.388 --> 17:36.098
I'll talk to Bitty about that tomorrow.

17:36.181 --> 17:38.141
I can't wait to tell Telman McCabe
about this.

17:38.225 --> 17:39.268
Oh, Richard.

17:39.351 --> 17:42.020
He's always bragging
about that simpleton grandson of his.

17:42.104 --> 17:43.605
William is a lovely boy.

17:43.689 --> 17:46.024
- His head is shaped like a football.
- It is not.

17:46.066 --> 17:48.861
If he fell asleep in the park,
someone would try to punt him.

17:48.944 --> 17:51.363
- Telman is a very dear friend of yours.
- Yes, he is.

17:51.446 --> 17:54.867
And one should always share
wonderful news with one's good friends.

17:54.908 --> 17:55.993
You just want to brag.

17:56.034 --> 17:57.286
I think I have a right.

17:57.369 --> 17:59.246
You'd think you were the one
who finished...

17:59.329 --> 18:01.039
in the top three percent of your class.

18:01.081 --> 18:04.585
It was my genes.
I get to claim a little responsibility.

18:05.210 --> 18:06.253
Goodness.

18:06.461 --> 18:08.255
I just spilled on my shirt.

18:08.589 --> 18:11.341
What are you doing?
What are they doing, Emily?

18:11.425 --> 18:13.760
I have no idea. Stop that, you two.

18:14.469 --> 18:16.263
- Sorry.
- Yeah, sorry.

18:17.222 --> 18:18.557
What is going on?

18:18.640 --> 18:21.727
I'm just really jazzed
about this whole three-percent thing.

18:21.810 --> 18:23.979
Yeah, really, really jazzed.

18:25.564 --> 18:27.566
Don't even try to understand, Richard.

18:27.608 --> 18:31.028
Antonia, please bring some club soda
for Mr. Gilmore's shirt.

18:33.614 --> 18:37.075
We're running out of clarified butter.
Chop that finer.

18:37.117 --> 18:38.452
No parboiling.

18:40.370 --> 18:44.082
That looks good. Add a little pinch
of oregano. I think we've got it.

18:44.124 --> 18:45.918
Okay, got your lobsters.

18:46.001 --> 18:48.921
Are they good?
They look good. Yes, they do.

18:48.962 --> 18:51.548
It's got my hand.

18:51.632 --> 18:56.136
Thanks. Okay, I'll be fine.
I'm a good clotter. Don't worry.

18:57.179 --> 19:01.058
You are fresh, aren't you?
Okay, in the back.

19:01.892 --> 19:04.937
- Michel, I'm gonna need you to move.
- In a minute.

19:05.020 --> 19:07.439
- What are you doing?
- I am weighing my turkey.

19:07.481 --> 19:08.524
Why?

19:08.607 --> 19:10.692
A group of scientists did a study on rats...

19:10.776 --> 19:12.986
where they cut their daily calories by 30%.

19:13.070 --> 19:14.071
And you felt left out?

19:14.154 --> 19:15.948
No, the rats lived 30% longer.

19:15.989 --> 19:19.201
The scientists were so impressed
that they cut their own calories...

19:19.284 --> 19:20.327
just like the rats.

19:20.410 --> 19:22.204
It was a very nice display of solidarity.

19:22.287 --> 19:25.749
I have decided to do the same.
I figure if I stay alive long enough...

19:25.833 --> 19:29.044
these scientists will be able
to cure anything, including death...

19:29.127 --> 19:32.005
therefore ensuring my indefinite existence.

19:32.089 --> 19:34.007
You're going to live forever?
Like on Fame?

19:34.091 --> 19:35.551
Don't speak to me.

19:35.634 --> 19:36.969
Give me back my scale.

19:37.010 --> 19:40.138
I have an announcement to make,
and it's big...

19:40.222 --> 19:42.641
and it's fabulous
and you are not going to believe it.

19:42.724 --> 19:44.893
- Goodbye.
- Wait. I got news.

19:44.977 --> 19:48.355
Well, I'm sure it's very exciting.
Excuse me.

19:48.438 --> 19:49.606
What's with the turkey?

19:49.648 --> 19:51.233
He thinks he's going to live forever.

19:51.316 --> 19:52.734
- Like on Fame?
- That's what I said.

19:52.818 --> 19:56.488
A hundred years from now, I'll sit
around telling my fellow men of science...

19:56.572 --> 20:00.993
about the two of you, and we will giggle
like little girls at your ignorance.

20:01.076 --> 20:02.995
Now I have work to do.

20:03.453 --> 20:05.455
He did say 'giggle like little girls,' right?

20:05.539 --> 20:08.500
Forget him.
Tell me about your fabulous news.

20:10.169 --> 20:12.212
- I'm engaged.
- What?

20:12.754 --> 20:13.922
I'm getting married.

20:14.006 --> 20:15.007
- No.
- Yes.

20:16.800 --> 20:17.801
- No.
- What?

20:17.885 --> 20:18.969
Sookie.

20:19.052 --> 20:22.556
Oh, my God. This is amazing. I'm shaking.

20:22.890 --> 20:25.767
Max is a wonderful man. It is Max, right?

20:25.851 --> 20:27.519
- Yes, it is Max.
- Good.

20:27.853 --> 20:30.981
- I knew it. I knew you'd get engaged.
- Really? God, I didn't.

20:31.064 --> 20:32.691
- You're going to be a Sadie.
- A what?

20:32.774 --> 20:33.775
A Sadie.

20:33.859 --> 20:37.613
Sadie, Sadie, married lady
Meet a mortgagee

20:37.696 --> 20:39.448
- Funny Girl!
- Streisand!

20:39.531 --> 20:41.450
- Stop it.
- Who's catering?

20:41.533 --> 20:43.660
- Bobby Flay?
- Not funny.

20:44.036 --> 20:46.413
- I'm making the cake also.
- Absolutely.

20:46.538 --> 20:49.583
I'll start a menu. Something light
and romantic to start with...

20:49.666 --> 20:52.002
something that will go wonderful
with champagne.

20:52.044 --> 20:55.214
Truffles go wonderful with champagne.
And scrambled eggs.

20:55.297 --> 20:56.298
Sookie? Honey?

20:56.381 --> 20:59.801
I know scrambled eggs don't sound
very festive, but when you put them...

20:59.885 --> 21:03.972
in a little quaiI's eggshell with caviar
on top, they're quite a crowd-pleaser.

21:04.139 --> 21:06.183
What's with the waterworks, lady?

21:06.266 --> 21:07.643
It's just...

21:08.101 --> 21:09.186
I don't know.

21:09.228 --> 21:12.814
You raised that little girl all alone,
and she is so great...

21:12.898 --> 21:14.942
and you work your butt off here...

21:15.025 --> 21:17.736
and you go to school
and you put up with me.

21:18.779 --> 21:21.990
- You just really deserve this.
- Thank you.

21:23.742 --> 21:27.287
Prepare yourself for the most gorgeous
Brussels sprouts ever.

21:27.412 --> 21:31.208
Sookie, are you okay? Are you hurt?
Have you been making cutlets again?

21:31.750 --> 21:33.961
Lorelai's getting married.

21:34.044 --> 21:37.130
I love saying that. Married.

21:37.464 --> 21:39.967
That's great. Congratulations.

21:40.259 --> 21:41.885
Thanks, Jackson.

21:41.927 --> 21:44.054
Do you want to look
at the Brussels sprouts?

21:44.096 --> 21:45.722
Yes, I do.

21:47.224 --> 21:50.936
What about some nice Brussels sprouts
with garlic olive oil for the wedding?

21:51.019 --> 21:54.606
That sounds like a 'till death do us part'
kind of side dish, doesn't it?

21:54.690 --> 21:56.149
I wouldn't know.

21:56.233 --> 21:58.569
What do you think
is the most romantic vegetable?

21:58.610 --> 22:01.989
- You know, I'm the wrong guy to ask.
- You're the vegetable guy.

22:02.072 --> 22:04.783
The normal vegetable guy,
not the romantic vegetable guy.

22:04.867 --> 22:07.995
I would have no idea
what an appropriate vegetable would be...

22:08.078 --> 22:10.622
to serve at a wedding.
I've never even been to a wedding.

22:10.706 --> 22:12.875
One. My cousin Bonbon.

22:12.958 --> 22:14.126
Yes, that's his real name.

22:14.168 --> 22:16.920
And I didn't stay long
and I didn't notice the vegetables...

22:16.962 --> 22:19.673
so I would not be the guy to ask
about wedding vegetables.

22:19.756 --> 22:22.092
I'm not the wedding vegetable guy.

22:23.427 --> 22:26.680
Jackson's got'Panicked, my girlfriend
wants to get married' face on.

22:26.763 --> 22:29.766
Yes, next time he's here,
tell him that you're pregnant.

22:29.850 --> 22:31.560
- With twins.
- Why not?

22:34.354 --> 22:35.480
So, what's the latest?

22:35.564 --> 22:37.983
I just got off the phone
with the American Consulate.

22:38.025 --> 22:39.026
And?

22:39.109 --> 22:41.820
- Can you say 'Hyung Yung'?
- No, and what is that?

22:41.904 --> 22:43.238
My Korean name.

22:43.322 --> 22:44.990
There must be something you can do.

22:45.073 --> 22:48.702
I'm a minor. I've been put in the custody
of family by my parents.

22:48.785 --> 22:50.662
That's it. It's over.

22:50.746 --> 22:53.499
You have to at least try to talk
to your family.

22:53.540 --> 22:54.791
I don't know.

22:55.042 --> 22:58.795
- Dinner.
- I have to go. Last meal.

22:58.837 --> 23:00.464
Call me later.

23:08.138 --> 23:09.389
Coming, Mama.

23:10.057 --> 23:11.558
Do you want Tater Tots also?

23:11.642 --> 23:14.144
- That's a rhetorical question, right?
- Right.

23:14.228 --> 23:17.105
So, what kind of dress are you thinking of?

23:18.857 --> 23:21.527
The one Stephanie Seymour wore
in the Guns N' Roses video.

23:21.610 --> 23:23.529
Did you pick your colors yet?

23:23.612 --> 23:24.947
- Yes.
- Really? What?

23:25.030 --> 23:27.699
- Spumoni.
- I am planning this wedding without you.

23:27.783 --> 23:30.828
You will have no say,
and I may not even let you come.

23:33.455 --> 23:35.916
- Hello?
- Rory? Good, it's Max.

23:35.999 --> 23:37.209
Hey, Max.

23:37.292 --> 23:40.254
Look, I've been out ring shopping all day.

23:40.379 --> 23:42.506
Ring shopping? Very interesting.

23:42.589 --> 23:45.050
Now, I've narrowed it down
to three different rings...

23:45.133 --> 23:47.511
but I want to get her something
she'll really like...

23:47.553 --> 23:50.347
not something she tells me she likes,
but she really hates.

23:50.389 --> 23:52.474
You know her taste in jewelry
better than I do.

23:52.558 --> 23:54.518
I thought maybe you could give me advice.

23:54.560 --> 23:57.646
Anything with the word 'foxy' on it
is a big crowd-pleaser.

23:57.729 --> 23:59.690
Maybe for our first anniversary.

23:59.731 --> 24:01.984
- Okay, I'm listening.
- Okay.

24:02.401 --> 24:06.572
The first ring has a gold band...

24:07.281 --> 24:10.742
and sort of a square diamond.
It's simple, but very classic.

24:10.826 --> 24:15.080
Gold band, square diamond, simple,
classic. I'm not sure that's really her.

24:15.122 --> 24:17.040
Okay. The next one...

24:17.708 --> 24:20.752
is sort of an engagement band...

24:20.836 --> 24:23.881
with small diamonds all around it,
white gold...

24:24.006 --> 24:27.467
and there's a wedding band
that sort of fits into it, like a set.

24:27.551 --> 24:30.929
White gold engagement band,
small diamonds around it...

24:30.971 --> 24:33.390
with wedding band that fits into it.

24:33.682 --> 24:35.225
That's a possibility.

24:35.434 --> 24:36.518
What's the third one?

24:36.602 --> 24:38.061
The third one...

24:39.771 --> 24:40.898
is from the '20s.

24:40.939 --> 24:42.566
From the '20s?

24:43.025 --> 24:44.443
Large diamond in the middle...

24:45.944 --> 24:47.571
diamond clusters on the sides...

24:49.740 --> 24:51.116
and it's a little deco.

24:54.411 --> 24:57.873
That sounds great. Good going.
She's going to be ecstatic.

24:57.956 --> 25:00.876
- She's right there with you, isn't she?
- What? No.

25:00.959 --> 25:02.544
I thought I heard her bark.

25:02.628 --> 25:05.589
No, that's just a wild jackal
that hangs out here sometimes.

25:06.131 --> 25:08.759
- Put Cujo on the phone, please.
- One sec.

25:09.176 --> 25:10.385
Here, boy.

25:11.553 --> 25:14.097
Hello, Max. What a pleasant surprise.

25:14.181 --> 25:15.766
I just walked in.

25:17.643 --> 25:19.394
- Hi.
- Am I late?

25:19.478 --> 25:21.438
- No, right on time.
- Good.

25:21.480 --> 25:25.108
- Are you coming in?
- In a sec. Where's your mom?

25:25.442 --> 25:27.027
In the kitchen, on the phone.

25:27.110 --> 25:28.987
Beginning, middle,
or end of a conversation?

25:29.071 --> 25:33.075
It concerns jewelry, so there may
not be an end to the conversation.

25:33.158 --> 25:34.660
Good.

25:35.244 --> 25:36.537
Hi.

25:39.790 --> 25:41.750
- I missed that.
- Me, too.

25:42.459 --> 25:45.963
So, this whole breaking-up thing,
we tried it.

25:46.004 --> 25:47.339
Yeah, we did.

25:47.422 --> 25:49.132
- Didn't really work for me.
- Me, either.

25:49.174 --> 25:51.552
Okay, good. So it's decided.
Breaking up, not for us.

25:51.635 --> 25:54.596
Not that it's a bad thing.
I'm sure some people like it.

25:54.680 --> 25:58.767
Sure. Cher, Gregg Allman.
I bet they give it a big thumbs-up.

25:58.976 --> 26:00.185
Did you pick out your ring?

26:00.269 --> 26:03.188
Yes. He's going to surprise me
with it tomorrow.

26:03.230 --> 26:04.314
'20s deco?

26:04.356 --> 26:07.109
Supposedly ripped off of Zelda Fitzgerald's
cold, dead hand.

26:07.192 --> 26:08.193
- Hey, Dean.
- Hey.

26:08.277 --> 26:09.319
When's dinner ready?

26:09.361 --> 26:11.572
- Do I look like a timer?
- I thought you'd set one.

26:11.655 --> 26:12.823
Timers are for kids.

26:12.865 --> 26:14.199
Ten minutes, we're there.

26:14.241 --> 26:15.284
I'll get it set up.

26:15.367 --> 26:16.785
What's the movie for tonight?

26:16.869 --> 26:18.704
My God, a classic.

26:18.787 --> 26:20.831
The Joan
and Melissa Rivers Story. Starring...

26:20.914 --> 26:21.957
Joan and Melissa Rivers.

26:22.040 --> 26:23.876
A mother and daughter
torn apart by tragedy.

26:23.959 --> 26:25.669
- Suicide.
- Not getting The Tonight Show.

26:25.711 --> 26:27.296
- Mean boyfriends.
- Identical noses.

26:27.379 --> 26:28.338
You'll laugh, you'll cry.

26:28.422 --> 26:29.715
'Cause you're laughing so hard.

26:29.756 --> 26:31.091
It'll be an evening to remember.

26:31.175 --> 26:32.176
In the pivotal scene...

26:32.217 --> 26:35.345
where a distraught Joan
gets locked out of High Holiday services...

26:35.387 --> 26:36.430
'cause she's late...

26:36.513 --> 26:40.517
I will be forced to rewind it and play it
over and over about 4,000 times.

26:41.435 --> 26:43.395
You'll never be the same.

26:47.232 --> 26:48.442
It's nice to have you back.

26:48.525 --> 26:49.985
Thanks. It's nice to be back.

26:50.068 --> 26:52.112
- We missed you.
- I missed you guys, too.

26:52.196 --> 26:55.699
No, I mean, we really missed you.

26:56.992 --> 26:58.994
You need the water bottle changed,
don't you?

26:59.077 --> 27:00.954
- Desperately.
- Rag.

27:01.038 --> 27:02.372
Thank you.

27:06.210 --> 27:07.878
Where's Dean?

27:07.920 --> 27:09.755
- Getting water.
- You're shameless.

27:09.838 --> 27:10.881
- He offered.
- Please.

27:10.964 --> 27:14.259
The first thing he said to me was,
'Lorelai, can I change your water?'

27:14.343 --> 27:16.428
What can I do? The kid's a freak.

27:21.683 --> 27:23.936
I'm so sorry
she's got you doing chores already.

27:23.977 --> 27:25.479
I don't mind.

27:25.562 --> 27:27.814
You will. She pulled out the mower
this morning.

27:27.898 --> 27:30.442
If that movie is anything
like you described...

27:30.526 --> 27:32.528
mowing might be a good alternative.

27:32.611 --> 27:35.072
- I wanted to ask you something.
- Yeah?

27:35.781 --> 27:38.867
My grandparents are having
this special dinner for me next week.

27:38.951 --> 27:41.578
It's nothing big,
but they said I could invite someone...

27:41.662 --> 27:44.081
and you've never seen
my grandparents' house...

27:44.122 --> 27:46.750
and I'd really like you to meet my grandpa.

27:48.877 --> 27:49.920
What?

27:49.962 --> 27:53.924
It's just the last time I met
your grandma...

27:53.966 --> 27:57.219
was the night of the dance,
and you know how that turned out, so...

27:57.302 --> 27:58.929
The dance was a long time ago.

27:58.971 --> 28:02.266
She's over it by now.
I'm sure everything will be fine.

28:02.474 --> 28:03.684
You want me to go?

28:03.809 --> 28:05.561
Yeah, I want you to go.

28:06.478 --> 28:07.938
Then I'll go.

28:08.397 --> 28:09.481
Good.

28:10.983 --> 28:15.821
Oh, my. That coffee can is just so high
up there. Whatever will I do?

28:15.988 --> 28:17.156
Coming.

28:20.325 --> 28:23.495
Antonia, take this and put it
in the dining room, please.

28:25.122 --> 28:27.416
I like that tie.

28:27.666 --> 28:29.793
Yes, it's rather snappy, isn't it?

28:30.460 --> 28:33.255
Don't you dare get on that phone.
They'll be here any second.

28:33.338 --> 28:34.590
I'm not getting on the phone.

28:34.673 --> 28:38.343
I'm going to give Rory that first edition
of Mencken's Chrestomathy.

28:40.929 --> 28:42.681
Well, hello there.

28:44.016 --> 28:46.685
- Well, hello there.
- Grandma, you remember Dean, right?

28:46.768 --> 28:48.478
Yes, I do. Nice to see you again.

28:48.520 --> 28:52.357
Thanks. Your house is great. It's huge.

28:52.858 --> 28:55.777
- I've never seen a house this huge before.
- Thank you.

28:55.861 --> 28:58.989
So few people bother to notice
the hugeness of the house anymore.

28:59.031 --> 29:02.993
Mom, it was so nice of you to tell Rory
to invite a friend tonight...

29:03.035 --> 29:06.538
seeing as this is her night.
That was really nice of you.

29:07.164 --> 29:09.208
- It was my pleasure.
- Good.

29:09.708 --> 29:13.212
Don't just stand there.
We have a celebration to attend. Come in.

29:23.222 --> 29:25.807
So, what would everyone like to drink?

29:25.891 --> 29:29.895
I'll have a white wine,
and Dean will have a beer.

29:30.062 --> 29:31.313
- What?
- Corona, right?

29:31.396 --> 29:33.941
No. I don't want a beer. I don't drink beer.

29:34.024 --> 29:36.735
I'll have a water or soda or anything.

29:36.777 --> 29:40.739
Or nothing. Not beer. Never beer.
Beer's bad.

29:40.823 --> 29:43.909
Relax, Dean,
that's just Lorelai's little sense of humor.

29:43.992 --> 29:46.745
- You're very cruel.
- Yes, it keeps me young.

29:46.787 --> 29:50.332
I'm just going to sit here
and stare at my hands.

29:50.415 --> 29:52.626
- Soda, Dean?
- Please.

29:53.502 --> 29:55.462
- Rory?
- I'll have a beer.

29:58.257 --> 30:00.676
I'm sorry, Dean. We're not laughing at you.

30:00.759 --> 30:04.012
- Wait, I think I was.
- I think I was a little, too.

30:04.388 --> 30:06.974
Richard, there you are. Come join us.

30:08.350 --> 30:09.393
Hey, Dad.

30:09.434 --> 30:11.979
Grandpa, hi. This is Dean.

30:12.437 --> 30:15.148
- Dean, this is my grandpa.
- Hi.

30:16.400 --> 30:18.402
Sorry. Hi.

30:19.653 --> 30:20.988
Hello.

30:21.446 --> 30:25.200
- It's nice to meet...
- Does everyone have drinks?

30:29.788 --> 30:31.957
Yeah. We all have drinks. Thanks.

30:38.797 --> 30:40.799
Should we do the beer thing again?

30:41.800 --> 30:43.427
I don't think so.

30:51.226 --> 30:54.396
Grandma, I can't believe you found
a recipe for beefaroni.

30:54.479 --> 30:57.107
It wasn't easy.
Antonia thought I'd gone insane.

30:58.275 --> 30:59.735
No one needs a comment from you.

30:59.818 --> 31:02.404
No, I was just going to say
what's the secret?

31:02.738 --> 31:04.323
Let's just say it's not beef.

31:04.781 --> 31:07.034
- Okay. I'm done.
- Me, too.

31:07.201 --> 31:09.495
Dean, would you like some more?

31:11.997 --> 31:14.166
No. I'm fine, thanks.

31:14.333 --> 31:16.793
Then, I guess it must be present time.

31:17.085 --> 31:18.295
You didn't have to.

31:18.337 --> 31:19.588
Yeah, Mom, you didn't have to.

31:19.671 --> 31:22.633
Unless you got something
that'll fit me, too. If so, good going.

31:22.674 --> 31:25.093
Here you go, Rory. Congratulations.
We're so proud.

31:25.177 --> 31:26.720
Thanks, Grandma.

31:27.721 --> 31:30.974
- Thanks, Grandpa.
- Now, go on. Open it.

31:31.308 --> 31:32.809
Okay.

31:34.269 --> 31:37.189
Oh, pens. All yours.

31:37.231 --> 31:38.273
It's beautiful.

31:38.357 --> 31:40.776
I think the top student deserves
the top tools.

31:40.859 --> 31:42.444
Thank you so much.

31:43.946 --> 31:45.113
Really.

31:47.699 --> 31:50.410
Well, pens are very nice, but I just bet...

31:50.494 --> 31:53.997
there is a fabulous, fancy dessert
just sitting out there in that kitchen.

31:54.081 --> 31:56.250
As a matter of fact, there is. Twinkies.

31:57.292 --> 31:59.837
Rory told me
that was her favorite dessert.

31:59.920 --> 32:02.381
Emily Gilmore, you are one classy broad.

32:02.464 --> 32:05.008
Antonia, please bring out the Twinkies.

32:05.050 --> 32:07.386
I can't believe I just heard you
say those words.

32:07.427 --> 32:08.720
Don't get used to it.

32:08.804 --> 32:10.013
So, Dean...

32:11.181 --> 32:13.725
where are you planning to go to college?

32:15.227 --> 32:18.313
Start off with 'What's your
favorite baseball team?' or something.

32:18.397 --> 32:19.565
I'm talking to Dean.

32:19.648 --> 32:21.108
I don't know yet.

32:21.191 --> 32:23.068
- You don't?
- No, not yet.

32:23.569 --> 32:26.113
What kind of grades do you get?

32:26.196 --> 32:28.031
Richard, please, don't grill the boy.

32:28.073 --> 32:31.577
I'm not grilling the boy.
It's an easy question.

32:31.660 --> 32:33.370
A's? B's? C's?

32:33.829 --> 32:35.080
I get a mixture, actually.

32:35.164 --> 32:38.417
A mixture? What's the ratio?

32:39.751 --> 32:41.962
I'm just trying
to get to know the boy, Emily.

32:42.045 --> 32:44.548
After all, Rory brings home a young man
to dinner.

32:44.631 --> 32:47.092
The least we could do is find out
something about him.

32:47.176 --> 32:48.802
He changes a mean water bottle.

32:48.886 --> 32:50.846
I get a couple of A's...

32:51.346 --> 32:54.308
a couple of B's, a few C's.

32:54.433 --> 32:57.227
- Really?
- I'm not great in math.

32:57.269 --> 32:59.188
Yeah. Except, who is, really?

32:59.271 --> 33:01.273
Except mathematicians
or blackjack dealers...

33:01.356 --> 33:03.483
or I guess Stephen Hawking doesn't suck.

33:03.567 --> 33:06.778
But you know what else is good, Mom,
is a ho ho.

33:06.820 --> 33:10.908
Because if you can't find a Twinkie,
you treat yourself to a nice ho ho.

33:13.785 --> 33:16.497
- How long does it take to open a box?
- She's making them.

33:16.580 --> 33:19.166
She's making the Twinkies?
You're kidding.

33:19.291 --> 33:22.085
Richard, wasn't there a book
you wanted to give Rory?

33:22.127 --> 33:24.963
- In a minute, Emily. So, Dean...
- Grandpa...

33:25.047 --> 33:27.758
...you do know that Rory's going
to an Ivy League school?

33:27.799 --> 33:28.800
I know.

33:28.884 --> 33:30.928
- Harvard, Princeton, Yale.
- He said he knew.

33:31.011 --> 33:33.222
You need top grades
to get into a top school.

33:33.305 --> 33:36.266
Yeah. Rory's really smart.

33:36.517 --> 33:38.602
Yeah. She is really smart.

33:38.685 --> 33:41.271
- Mom?
- Why don't we all go sit in the...

33:41.355 --> 33:44.942
How are you planning to make a living
once you graduate from this college...

33:45.025 --> 33:46.777
you haven't thought anything about yet?

33:46.818 --> 33:48.904
Grandpa, can we talk about
something else?

33:48.987 --> 33:50.531
I'm going to get that book.

33:50.614 --> 33:52.115
I asked you a question.

33:52.324 --> 33:54.493
I don't know what I want to do.

33:54.743 --> 33:57.246
You know, when I was 10 years old...

33:57.746 --> 34:00.290
I knew exactly where I wanted to work.

34:00.457 --> 34:03.335
That's because you were always
picked last for dodge ball.

34:03.377 --> 34:05.420
I knew I wanted to go to Yale...

34:05.504 --> 34:08.841
and put on a nice suit every day
and be a very important man...

34:08.882 --> 34:10.801
in a very powerful firm.

34:10.967 --> 34:13.469
And I knew I wanted to travel
and see the world.

34:13.637 --> 34:14.638
That's great.

34:14.721 --> 34:18.225
I wanted to see La Traviata
at the La Scala opera house.

34:18.600 --> 34:22.271
I wanted to walk the ruins of Pompeii.
I wanted to travel the Far East.

34:22.353 --> 34:24.273
Or be a ballerina, or a fireman.

34:24.356 --> 34:25.732
Lorelai, this isn't funny.

34:25.815 --> 34:29.987
It's a little funny to think of a 10-year-old
kid dreaming of the La Scala opera house.

34:30.027 --> 34:32.906
Rory does. Rory wants to travel.
Rory has plans.

34:32.989 --> 34:33.991
Rory's special.

34:34.074 --> 34:35.784
Yes. Exactly.

34:36.076 --> 34:37.661
Rory is special.

34:38.203 --> 34:40.621
- I know that Rory's special.
- I've got it.

34:40.706 --> 34:43.917
Dean is special, too, Grandpa.
You don't even know him.

34:44.001 --> 34:45.878
- I know enough.
- No, you don't.

34:45.960 --> 34:50.007
Dean is incredible, and he's special to me.
And I bring him here, and you attack him.

34:50.090 --> 34:52.176
I will not be spoken to like that
in my house.

34:52.217 --> 34:53.260
Here, give her the book.

34:53.342 --> 34:54.428
This family has standards.

34:54.511 --> 34:56.889
You live up to them.
You should expect that everyone...

34:56.972 --> 34:58.724
you spend time with live up to them also.

34:58.807 --> 35:01.435
You are a gifted girl
with immense promise...

35:01.518 --> 35:04.813
and you should learn very early
that certain people can hold you back.

35:04.897 --> 35:07.858
Grandpa, stop it.
You cannot treat Dean this way.

35:07.941 --> 35:10.277
I'm sorry. Excuse me. I have to work.

35:10.819 --> 35:11.862
Grandpa.

35:14.740 --> 35:16.909
Thank you for the dinner
and the gift, Grandma...

35:16.992 --> 35:19.578
but I really think we should be going.

35:19.995 --> 35:21.246
Thanks.

35:22.414 --> 35:23.790
I'm sorry.

35:30.756 --> 35:33.759
Am I crazy?
That's supposed to be us, right?

35:40.015 --> 35:43.519
Want to come in and have some dessert?
You never did get your Twinkie.

35:44.228 --> 35:46.772
No, thanks. I think I should get going.

35:46.855 --> 35:48.815
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

35:49.399 --> 35:52.945
Okay, all I can say is, Dean, tonight
you officially became a Gilmore girl.

35:53.028 --> 35:54.780
Feels good, huh?

35:54.822 --> 35:57.866
- Yeah.
- See you later. Meet you inside.

36:02.037 --> 36:03.789
I don't even know what to say.

36:03.872 --> 36:05.249
It's no big deal.

36:05.290 --> 36:08.752
I had no idea. I thought he would...

36:10.128 --> 36:13.006
- I am so sorry, Dean.
- It's not your fault.

36:13.090 --> 36:16.593
None of those things he said were true.
None of them mean anything.

36:16.677 --> 36:18.470
I don't know what made him act that way.

36:18.512 --> 36:21.682
Let's just forget it, all right?

36:22.391 --> 36:24.351
- Please don't be upset.
- I'm not.

36:24.434 --> 36:27.145
- Dean...
- I'm fine. I'm not upset.

36:30.607 --> 36:32.234
I have to go.

36:34.444 --> 36:36.822
- Call you tomorrow.
- Okay.

36:43.036 --> 36:44.413
That man is impossible.

36:44.496 --> 36:45.497
Twinkie?

36:45.581 --> 36:47.666
He just attacks Dean out of nowhere...

36:47.749 --> 36:51.920
and Dean is sitting there being
perfectly nice, and then all of a sudden...

36:52.212 --> 36:55.716
- God, I'm so mad. He's a snob.
- Yes.

36:56.133 --> 36:59.511
And he doesn't listen.
He just wants to say horrible things...

36:59.553 --> 37:03.182
and have you sit there and listen to him
and then just agree with him.

37:03.265 --> 37:04.391
What is that all about?

37:04.474 --> 37:07.019
That is about a hundred years' worth
of inbreeding.

37:07.352 --> 37:10.606
I've never seen him be mean before, ever.
Not like that.

37:10.689 --> 37:12.816
I don't know
how I'll ever talk to him again.

37:12.858 --> 37:15.986
And Dean, he must be so upset right now.

37:16.028 --> 37:17.863
I hate that he did this to him.

37:17.946 --> 37:22.034
Yes, it was bad.
My father was in fine form tonight. But...

37:22.159 --> 37:25.370
- But? There's a 'but' from you?
- Twinkie?

37:27.539 --> 37:29.750
I don't think my father has ever loved...

37:29.833 --> 37:32.211
anything in this world
as much as he loves you.

37:32.294 --> 37:35.297
Now, that having been established,
let's just consider...

37:35.380 --> 37:38.926
that maybe this flip-out tonight
actually came from somewhere...

37:39.009 --> 37:43.514
that possibly has nothing to do with Dean
and possibly has nothing to do with you.

37:44.056 --> 37:45.682
What are you talking about?

37:45.724 --> 37:49.353
You are the great white hope
of the Gilmore clan.

37:49.436 --> 37:52.523
You are their angel sent from up above.

37:53.273 --> 37:55.275
- You are the daughter they didn't have.
- Mom...

37:55.359 --> 37:59.404
No, it's not a feel-sorry-for-me thing.
It's just the truth.

37:59.488 --> 38:01.532
I mean, you're going to go to college.

38:01.615 --> 38:04.660
Hell, you're going to graduate
from high school.

38:04.743 --> 38:07.246
They'll get to watch you
walk down the aisle...

38:07.329 --> 38:11.917
wearing your cap and gown
and get your diploma and go to Harvard...

38:12.459 --> 38:16.630
and be a Phi Beta bimbo
and graduate with honors...

38:16.755 --> 38:19.091
and just set the world on fire.

38:19.216 --> 38:21.927
I mean, that is the plan.
Looks like it's going to happen.

38:22.010 --> 38:23.762
It is going to happen.

38:24.596 --> 38:26.932
Except for that 'Phi Beta bimbo' part.

38:27.683 --> 38:30.811
But then tonight,
you walk in with this beautiful boy...

38:30.894 --> 38:35.190
who likes you enough to brave going
to your grandparents' house for dinner...

38:35.274 --> 38:38.986
and Dad looks at you
and sees you with him...

38:39.528 --> 38:43.282
and all of a sudden,
has a terrible Lorelai flashback.

38:44.032 --> 38:47.077
He sees it all going away,
the college, the cap and gown.

38:47.119 --> 38:49.663
- I'm not going to get pregnant.
- I know that.

38:49.746 --> 38:52.583
- He should know that.
- Yes. He should.

38:52.666 --> 38:55.502
But... You do have my eyes.

38:55.586 --> 38:58.338
You do realize you just spent 10 minutes
defending your dad?

38:58.422 --> 39:01.758
I know. I'll have terrible nightmares
all night long.

39:01.800 --> 39:04.678
But I'll tell you what,
if you cut him a little slack...

39:04.761 --> 39:09.224
I'll wear my 'porn star'T-shirt
to dinner next week.

39:09.308 --> 39:10.684
- Deal.
- Good.

39:15.147 --> 39:16.148
Hello?

39:16.231 --> 39:17.524
I just thought you should know.

39:17.608 --> 39:21.236
My parents just brought in the suitcase
that I'm supposed to take on my trip.

39:21.320 --> 39:24.781
To paint you a picture, it could fit
you and me, plus everything we own...

39:24.823 --> 39:27.659
and still have enough room
to do a little souvenir shopping.

39:27.743 --> 39:29.369
I am never coming back.

39:29.453 --> 39:33.373
What is Lorelai thinking, letting Rory
run around with a boy like that?

39:33.457 --> 39:36.460
Of course, she isn't thinking.
She never thinks.

39:36.543 --> 39:38.837
Richard, please.
You're giving me a headache.

39:38.921 --> 39:41.173
And what were you thinking,
inviting him over here?

39:41.256 --> 39:43.967
We told her she could invite someone.
You were right there.

39:44.009 --> 39:46.094
- I did not mean him.
- Please calm down.

39:46.178 --> 39:48.597
I will not.
Did you hear the way she talked to me?

39:48.680 --> 39:50.140
I heard the way she talked to you.

39:50.182 --> 39:51.517
She sounded like her mother.

39:51.600 --> 39:53.143
You were attacking her boyfriend.

39:53.185 --> 39:55.187
A girl that age shouldn't have a boyfriend.

39:55.270 --> 39:58.065
You truly think a 16-year-old girl
isn't going to date?

39:58.148 --> 40:00.192
Of course she'll date, and she should date.

40:00.317 --> 40:02.694
Proper socialization
is important to a child.

40:02.736 --> 40:06.114
But she should not date one boy,
and she should not date him.

40:06.198 --> 40:07.491
Don't answer that.

40:07.699 --> 40:08.951
I'm going to answer it.

40:09.034 --> 40:11.203
Emily, we are
in the middle of a discussion.

40:11.286 --> 40:14.706
I'm sure you'll remember exactly
where you were five minutes from now.

40:14.790 --> 40:17.209
- Hello?
- Hi. Mrs. Gilmore?

40:17.292 --> 40:19.461
It's Sookie St. James, Lorelai's friend.

40:19.545 --> 40:21.255
I don't know if you'd remember me.

40:21.338 --> 40:23.006
Yes, you're the chef at the Inn.

40:23.048 --> 40:26.760
That's right. I'm sorry to call
so late, but I need to ask a question.

40:26.844 --> 40:29.847
I'm planning a surprise wedding shower
for Lorelai and Max.

40:29.888 --> 40:31.598
It's going to be more like a big party.

40:31.682 --> 40:35.227
I've cleared the date with everybody
around here, so we're all set to go...

40:35.310 --> 40:37.688
but I wanted to make sure
you guys would be around...

40:37.729 --> 40:41.733
before I finalized everything.
It's going to be Saturday the 21st.

40:43.402 --> 40:45.737
I don't know. I'd have to check.

40:47.489 --> 40:51.743
Okay. You check,
and then you call me at the Inn.

40:53.537 --> 40:55.873
- Yes, I'll get back to you.
- Okay.

41:03.130 --> 41:05.424
I want you to call Rory tomorrow
and apologize.

41:05.465 --> 41:06.466
What?

41:06.550 --> 41:09.845
I want you to tell her you're sorry,
that you weren't feeling well...

41:09.928 --> 41:12.764
and you think Dean is a lovely boy
and he's welcome anytime.

41:12.848 --> 41:14.892
Have you gone insane?
Under no circumstances...

41:14.933 --> 41:17.269
Our daughter is getting married.

41:18.437 --> 41:20.898
She's getting married,
and she didn't tell us.

41:20.939 --> 41:24.568
When Rory decides to get married,
I'd like her to tell us.

41:25.944 --> 41:27.613
Call her tomorrow.

41:38.499 --> 41:40.459
- It was awful.
- It sounds awful.

41:40.501 --> 41:42.294
That's the family you want to marry into.

41:42.377 --> 41:44.671
- I must be insane.
- You must be.

41:46.131 --> 41:48.926
- Speaking of marrying into...
- Yes?

41:49.635 --> 41:52.721
...I have a little something for you.
- Let me guess.

41:52.804 --> 41:55.432
Is it gum? Because you know
how much I like gum...

41:55.516 --> 41:58.352
and how concerned I am
about dental hygiene.

42:01.313 --> 42:02.481
Oh, my.

42:03.524 --> 42:04.691
You like?

42:04.942 --> 42:06.235
It's beautiful.

42:10.781 --> 42:12.115
It's too big.

42:12.157 --> 42:13.992
- No, it's not.
- Give it to me.

42:14.034 --> 42:15.410
No, you can't have it back.

42:15.494 --> 42:17.663
- I'll get it sized.
- No, it's okay.

42:17.746 --> 42:18.705
It's going to fall off.

42:18.789 --> 42:20.791
- I'll wear it on my thumb.
- You won't do that.

42:20.874 --> 42:22.501
I'll eat a lot of salt and bloat up.

42:22.584 --> 42:26.463
Just let me get it sized, and I promise
you'll never have to take it off again.

42:26.505 --> 42:28.924
In fact, I'm going to insist on it.

42:37.891 --> 42:41.019
- Just in a minute, okay?
- Okay.

42:53.907 --> 42:55.742
I'm getting married.
