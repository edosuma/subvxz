00:29.808 --> 00:31.809
Kya! Kya!

00:33.712 --> 00:34.992
Hmm.

00:37.376 --> 00:41.777
Oh, that's pretty good. 
Kya!

00:42.039 --> 00:44.627
BMO! Keep it down!

00:44.817 --> 00:47.623
But you said 8:00 to 10:00 is my
time to do karate.

00:47.690 --> 00:49.305
It's my karate time!

00:49.372 --> 00:52.904
I know, but I got a headache,
and I'm in a funky mood.

00:52.971 --> 00:55.304
- What's wrong, dude?
- I don't know.

00:55.371 --> 00:58.831
- I think I got restless-leg syndrome.
- Is that from gettin' chubby?

00:58.898 --> 01:03.199
- What? No, man, it's just restless leg!
- Oop! My bad.

01:03.266 --> 01:06.572
- What are you reading?
- This old copy of Adventure Boy magazine.

01:06.639 --> 01:10.026
The only magazine for boy adventurers.
This kid rusty is getting chased

01:10.093 --> 01:11.939
down the river by three grown otters.

01:12.006 --> 01:13.647
This magazine rules!

01:13.714 --> 01:16.675
- But I'm saving the end for tomorrow.
- Cool!

01:16.820 --> 01:19.978
Well, I hope your leg feels better.
I'm turning in.

01:20.253 --> 01:24.350
- I'll see you up there.
- Pbht!

01:24.614 --> 01:27.664
- Jake.
- No, BMO.

01:28.507 --> 01:29.891
- Kya!

01:30.741 --> 01:33.780
No, BMO!
No more!

01:34.373 --> 01:37.007
Maybe some soup will take
the edge off.

- Bzzzt, bzzzt!
- Ew! Gross! Nasty!

01:53.562 --> 01:58.436
- Bzzzt, bzzzt!     - Hyah!
- Bzzzt, bzzzt, bzzzt!

02:00.039 --> 02:02.708
I'm sorry you were born
a fly and I had to kill you,

02:02.775 --> 02:06.165
you disgusting,
disgusting creature.

02:06.232 --> 02:09.344
- Kya, kya, kya!
- BMO, please!

02:25.537 --> 02:27.944
Finn, was that you?

02:29.447 --> 02:31.762
Probably just BMO or something.

02:35.716 --> 02:37.051
That's weird.

02:37.118 --> 02:40.322
BMO doesn't like '30s jazz.

02:46.244 --> 02:49.648
Yeesh. Creepy.

02:55.990 --> 02:58.689
I didn't know we had one
of those.

02:59.691 --> 03:01.900
Hey, hey!
Hey, who?

03:08.084 --> 03:09.870
Aah!

03:14.940 --> 03:18.980
Hey, I killed you! Aah!

03:20.499 --> 03:25.763
- Ah! Ghost fly touching me! Finn! Finn!
- Aah!

03:25.830 --> 03:29.354
- Ghost fly, man! Aah! Aah!
- Okay.

03:29.421 --> 03:32.241
Come on, man. Let's get out
of the house. It's a ghost fly!

03:32.308 --> 03:35.053
- So what?
- No, man, ghost flies are filthy!

03:35.120 --> 03:39.362
They carry diseases such as
tuberculosis, polio, dysentery.

03:39.429 --> 03:43.125
They leave those little fly doodies
on your soul. Aah!

03:48.607 --> 03:50.606
- Aah!
- Aah!

03:50.673 --> 03:54.000
- Finn, Jake! What's wrong?
- Ghost fly!

03:54.112 --> 03:56.111
Aaahhh!

04:05.786 --> 04:08.771
Thank goodness
we lost him. He's gone.

04:10.163 --> 04:11.882
- Whoo!
- Aah!

04:11.949 --> 04:16.175
- Run! Just run! Oy!
- Ai, ai, ai, ai!

04:22.474 --> 04:26.059
Hmm. Kya! Kya!

04:27.823 --> 04:30.929
Who-o-o-a! Aah!

04:31.643 --> 04:33.886
We should ask
what its unfinished business is.

04:33.953 --> 04:36.053
Ghosts always have
unfinished business!

04:36.120 --> 04:38.233
Ghost fly,
what's your problem?

04:39.021 --> 04:43.598
Come on, dude! Tell us your
unfinished business. Ah! It's no good.

04:43.665 --> 04:45.071
He's a tortured little spirit.

04:45.138 --> 04:47.385
We need help to communicate with
this ghost fly.

04:47.452 --> 04:49.588
Nah, man, let's just get someone
to banish it.

04:49.655 --> 04:52.977
Someone with serious
paranormal juice.

05:02.608 --> 05:03.978
Is he coming soon?

05:04.268 --> 05:07.202
I think so.
His ways are kind of mysterious.

05:07.269 --> 05:08.912
That's cool!

05:15.713 --> 05:17.939
Who-o-o-o-o-a!

05:18.422 --> 05:21.848
- Woo?
- Let's get this ritual rolling.

05:21.915 --> 05:25.376
- I got stuff to do.
- Woo!

05:25.443 --> 05:32.195
Hey! No! Unclean demon,
feel the sting of holy water!

05:33.576 --> 05:35.234
Thank you.

05:37.795 --> 05:41.055
These circles will protect you
from the ghost's attacks

05:41.122 --> 05:43.613
while I prepare
the banishing ritual.

05:43.740 --> 05:46.815
Worry not, fellow believers,
for in this bag,

05:46.882 --> 05:49.610
I possess all the darkest
and most powerful tools

05:49.677 --> 05:52.478
of magic ever to be
assembled in one place.

05:52.545 --> 05:57.512
We're perfectly safe...
As long as... We... Have...

06:14.032 --> 06:17.622
Well, huh.
How about that? No biggie.

06:17.748 --> 06:20.730
We'll just hang out inside
these magic circles until morning.

06:20.826 --> 06:22.708
That's when
ghosts go to sleep.

06:22.836 --> 06:27.348
Yep. Just got to make it.
Till morning.

06:43.748 --> 06:45.215
Woo!

06:50.322 --> 06:51.593
Hmm?

06:58.312 --> 07:02.070
Aah! The end of my story.
And it's so close.

07:02.199 --> 07:04.952
- Don't do it, bro. It's a trap.
- I know.

07:05.019 --> 07:09.418
It's an obvy trap.
But wait! What if...

07:09.907 --> 07:12.333
Watch this.
Ha!

07:14.169 --> 07:16.115
- Mm?
- Dude, what are you...

07:16.182 --> 07:22.183
If I extend the circle...
Farther...

07:22.686 --> 07:26.887
- I can get closer to the magazine.
- Theoretically, that is possible.

07:26.954 --> 07:29.375
Yeah, but I'm still getting
a "woo-jah" feeling.

07:29.442 --> 07:30.836
This seems like a bad idea.

07:30.903 --> 07:35.038
Just have to stay
inside this circle!

07:38.310 --> 07:42.517
Haha! How'd you do it, Rusty?
How'd you shake them otters?

07:47.770 --> 07:50.240
Man, what a
great ending!

07:55.413 --> 07:57.803
Finn?
What's wrong, buddy?

08:02.521 --> 08:09.395
Oh, Finn, you're disgusting!

08:22.941 --> 08:25.970
Aw, that's it! I've had it with this
ghost fly!

08:26.037 --> 08:27.216
I wish I were a ghost

08:27.283 --> 08:29.235
so I could punch him
with my ghost fist!

08:29.302 --> 08:31.450
Jake, I have a radical option.

08:31.517 --> 08:33.207
I've been studying
a karate move

08:33.275 --> 08:35.476
that could temporarily stop
your heart

08:35.543 --> 08:37.847
long enough for you
to fight the ghost

08:37.914 --> 08:40.293
on his own plane of existence.

08:40.360 --> 08:41.929
- What?
- It's okay!

08:41.996 --> 08:44.044
I learned it
out of a magazine.

08:44.111 --> 08:45.452
Finn.

08:46.618 --> 08:49.957
All right. But first you got to
give me some unfinished business

08:50.024 --> 08:52.887
- so I can come back as a ghost.
- Tell me a joke.

08:52.954 --> 08:56.122
Okay. What do you call a bear
that only attacks guys named Paul?

08:56.189 --> 08:59.043
Kya!

09:01.051 --> 09:07.281
- I killed Jake! Yay, BMO!
- Whoa! BMO, you killed me.

09:07.438 --> 09:12.297
- Whoa. Wow. Wow!
- Jake! I can't hear you!

09:12.364 --> 09:16.921
I will start your heart up in
five minutes, okay? This many.

09:16.988 --> 09:20.294
Okay. Five minutes.
Whoa!

09:20.508 --> 09:23.258
Is this some kind of low-level
dead world?

09:23.325 --> 09:24.823
That's a bummer.

09:25.557 --> 09:26.986
Ah!

09:31.470 --> 09:33.813
Ah! Oh, stuff!

09:33.880 --> 09:36.661
Aah! Ohh! Ohh!

09:37.588 --> 09:42.376
Get away!
Ah! You killed it!

09:42.443 --> 09:43.619
Aah!

09:47.380 --> 09:52.476
Aah! Aah! Get away!

09:52.698 --> 09:56.500
Aah! Whoa!

09:56.568 --> 10:04.568
Whoa! Aah!

10:06.178 --> 10:12.449
Aaah!

10:12.516 --> 10:15.444
- Hmm?
- Oooh!

10:18.190 --> 10:23.237
That's right.
You never finished the soup.

10:23.304 --> 10:26.751
- That's your unfinished business!
- Woo-hoo!

10:26.818 --> 10:28.395
And now that you've finished it,

10:28.462 --> 10:31.827
you get to ascend to
a glorious new peaceful realm.

10:34.453 --> 10:38.062
Aaah! Bam!

10:38.388 --> 10:40.958
Shouldn't have tried
to kill me, son!

10:41.772 --> 10:46.919
Yes! What's happening?
Oh, BMO must be bringing me back.

10:46.986 --> 10:49.888
Yes! Yeah, BMO!

10:52.663 --> 10:56.609
- Mm, BMO?
- Jake, I missed you, bro!

10:56.676 --> 10:58.693
- Jake!
- Don't ever leave me again!

10:58.760 --> 11:01.553
Good job, BMO!
You brought me back.

11:01.620 --> 11:08.565
- Yes. Yay, BMO! BMO is so good!
- Whew!
