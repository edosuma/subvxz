01:20.736 --> 01:22.576
<i>Alert, alert, alert!</i>

01:55.096 --> 01:59.736
<i>You three criminals have been caught
in a further act of seditious treason.</i>

02:00.656 --> 02:04.656
<i>General Zod, your only feeling
was contempt for our society.</i>

02:05.296 --> 02:07.656
<i>Your only desire was to command.</i>

02:09.056 --> 02:12.936
<i>Ursa, the only feeling you showed
was for your vicious general.</i>

02:13.376 --> 02:15.976
<i>Your only wish, to rule at his side.</i>

02:17.016 --> 02:21.936
<i>Non, you are as without thought
as you are without voice.</i>

02:23.656 --> 02:26.776
<i>This council has no hesitation
in proclaiming you...</i>

02:27.016 --> 02:28.976
<i>...all guilty!</i>

02:30.056 --> 02:31.256
<i>Guilty!</i>

03:01.096 --> 03:03.416
<i>You will lie down before me, Jor-El.</i>

03:03.816 --> 03:06.176
<i>Both you and them one day, Jor-El.</i>

03:07.056 --> 03:08.056
<i>Jor-El!</i>

08:43.416 --> 08:46.456
<i>- Here, I'll just get the door for you.
- Yeah, thanks...</i>

08:47.096 --> 08:48.736
Sorry, after you.

08:52.976 --> 08:55.056
- 'Morning, Phil.
- Excuse me, Kent.

08:59.256 --> 09:02.696
<i>Hi, Alice. That's a very pretty blouse
you're wearing today...</i>

09:02.776 --> 09:04.336
Catch you later, Clark.

09:04.736 --> 09:09.176
<i>Hello. I don't know. Okay...</i>

09:09.336 --> 09:11.256
- 'Morning, Louise.
- I'll check it.

09:13.976 --> 09:16.976
Mr. White, how long should
the pressroom hold the front page?

09:17.056 --> 09:19.456
Give it another 10 minutes. I'll tell him.

09:19.536 --> 09:20.416
Thank you.

09:20.496 --> 09:23.256
If we don't get anything new
in the next 10 minutes...

09:23.336 --> 09:27.536
...go with the wire service copy under
the 40 point banner. Picture in 3 columns.

09:27.896 --> 09:32.576
Kent, do a background story for the page
three sidebar on this terrorist group.

09:32.656 --> 09:33.416
Right!

09:34.976 --> 09:36.896
Sorry. Terrorists?

09:37.176 --> 09:39.816
Get your heads out of the clouds.
Where have you been?

09:39.936 --> 09:41.096
I was at home.

09:41.176 --> 09:42.536
Don't you watch TV?

09:42.656 --> 09:46.176
I don't enjoy TV, there's too much violence.
I was just reading Dickens.

09:46.256 --> 09:49.536
Mr. Kent, a gang of terrorists
seized the Eiffel Tower in Paris.

09:49.656 --> 09:53.056
He knows where the Eiffel Tower is, Olsen.
You do, don't you, Kent?

09:53.176 --> 09:56.216
- Yes. Has anyone been hurt?
- So far the hostages are unharmed.

09:56.336 --> 09:57.176
Hostages?

09:57.256 --> 10:00.496
- Tourists, about 20 of them.
- That's just penny ante stuff.

10:00.536 --> 10:03.176
If the French government
doesn't meet their demands...

10:03.256 --> 10:05.536
...they've got a Hydrogen bomb
to level Paris.

10:05.976 --> 10:07.736
Mr. White, that's terrible!

10:08.176 --> 10:10.656
That's why they call them terrorists, Kent.

10:11.176 --> 10:14.456
Get to the morgue. I want to know
everything there is on terrorism...

10:14.536 --> 10:16.416
Does Lois know about this yet?

10:16.536 --> 10:19.056
- Does she know about it? She's in it!
- She's what?

10:19.216 --> 10:22.176
When the story broke,
I bundled her on the first Concorde.

10:22.496 --> 10:25.376
If Paris might go kablooey,
I want my best reporter there.

10:25.456 --> 10:26.336
<i>But gee...</i>

10:26.456 --> 10:28.896
No offense. You're good,
but Lois Lane is better.

10:29.336 --> 10:31.896
No, I meant,
isn't that a little bit dangerous, sir?

10:31.976 --> 10:34.296
That goes with the territory, Kent.

10:34.736 --> 10:38.456
Don't worry, if I know Lois Lane,
she'll not only come back...

10:38.576 --> 10:41.496
...with a Pulitzer Prize story,
but a one-on-one interview...

10:41.576 --> 10:44.536
...with the hydrogen bomb titled:
"What Makes Me Tick. "

10:44.776 --> 10:46.216
<i>Now don't stand around, Kent...</i>

11:16.616 --> 11:18.576
<i>Merci, Merci.</i>

11:27.776 --> 11:29.216
How did they get up there?

11:29.256 --> 11:31.776
They were disguised as workers
to do repairs.

11:31.856 --> 11:34.256
Can you say why they released
the first hostages?

11:34.336 --> 11:38.296
We insist they do this to show good faith.
If not, we refuse to negotiate.

11:38.336 --> 11:40.336
Will they release the other hostages?

11:40.416 --> 11:43.976
In return for a guarantee
that we will not launch an attack on them.

11:44.096 --> 11:47.736
There will no be attack?
No attempt to overpower the terrorists?

11:47.856 --> 11:50.096
- We've made this guarantee.
- You'll honor it?

11:50.416 --> 11:52.176
We have not the choice to refuse.

11:52.256 --> 11:54.736
If we believe it's a real
hydrogen bomb they have.

11:54.816 --> 11:55.936
Where is the bomb?

11:56.016 --> 11:57.576
It's in a big oil can.

11:57.656 --> 12:00.136
A hydrogen bomb? Are you sure?

12:00.896 --> 12:05.896
How can we be sure? Today it's possible
to make a bomb if you have the equipment.

12:06.056 --> 12:08.656
<i>- This could blow up all of Paris.
- Oui.</i>

12:08.776 --> 12:11.656
The position of your government?
Will they meet the demands?

12:11.696 --> 12:14.176
I am not authorized
to say what they will do.

12:14.256 --> 12:18.136
At this moment there is an emergency
meeting in the Elysée Palace.

12:18.976 --> 12:20.496
<i>Non, ce n'est pas possible.</i>

12:20.616 --> 12:25.296
<i>Excusez-moi? No. No comprende.
Moi, journaliste Americaine.</i>

12:25.416 --> 12:28.056
<i>Non, non, c'est interdit!
Complétement interdit.</i>

12:28.616 --> 12:29.696
<i>Attends. Wait.</i>

12:32.736 --> 12:37.016
<i>- Voilà. Qu'est-ce que c'est le mot pour...
- Qu'est-ce que vous voulez?</i>

12:37.936 --> 12:39.816
<i>- Stairs. Stairs?
- Stairs...</i>

12:45.216 --> 12:48.256
<i>S- T... S-T-A...</i>

12:50.696 --> 12:51.976
<i>Mademoiselle!</i>

13:03.456 --> 13:05.216
We'll bring them down now.

13:05.296 --> 13:06.096
Get in.

13:07.336 --> 13:10.536
<i>- Come on. Watch out for any tricks.
- Do we look like the sort...</i>

13:10.616 --> 13:12.416
I don't know what you look like.

13:12.736 --> 13:14.656
You're being released, so shut up.

13:54.736 --> 13:57.416
- Come on then, everybody out.
- Okay, we're ready.

13:58.776 --> 13:59.576
This way.

14:02.776 --> 14:04.496
Come on. Quick.

14:05.776 --> 14:08.176
Look, you're being released. Get moving.

14:08.816 --> 14:10.416
I'll take a last look around.

14:16.776 --> 14:18.376
Okay, send them down.

14:25.936 --> 14:26.936
Up we go.

14:30.336 --> 14:31.416
Pulitzer Prize.

14:34.736 --> 14:35.736
<i>CapitaI P...</i>

14:52.656 --> 14:54.456
Should we have let the hostages go?

14:54.576 --> 14:57.496
They'll give in to us
as soon as we plant the bomb.

14:57.616 --> 14:59.816
It doesn't matter one way or the other.

15:01.896 --> 15:05.216
Nobel Prize. Capital N...

15:05.936 --> 15:07.936
...little o, little b...

15:08.096 --> 15:10.256
...little e, little I.

15:10.976 --> 15:14.696
<i>Nobel. Nobel. Nobel, Nobel...</i>

15:19.056 --> 15:20.216
Prize!

15:27.016 --> 15:28.136
Be careful.

15:28.736 --> 15:31.736
It's me that controls the bomb,
not the bomb that controls me.

15:31.896 --> 15:34.536
I hope you have
not many sins left to be forgiven.

15:34.616 --> 15:38.616
Because if you let go of that,
you'll have only 60 seconds to list them.

15:40.776 --> 15:43.416
You are right. Do you hear something?

15:44.016 --> 15:46.416
It sounded like
someone moving underneath.

15:46.616 --> 15:47.736
It's your nerves.

15:51.016 --> 15:52.216
Where are they now?

15:52.456 --> 15:54.136
They are near to the lift.

15:55.896 --> 15:58.096
One is still inside with the bomb.

15:58.216 --> 16:02.536
<i>Ils sont prés de I'ascenseur. Y en a un
dedans avec la bombe. Il y en a un qui sort.</i>

16:03.056 --> 16:05.576
The third one has come out of the lift now.

16:06.496 --> 16:07.936
<i>The third one is out now.</i>

16:08.056 --> 16:09.616
The bomb is still in there?

16:09.696 --> 16:11.056
<i>Yes, we think so.</i>

16:16.336 --> 16:17.896
This is the boring bit.

16:39.016 --> 16:40.416
Tell them to get ready.

16:41.496 --> 16:44.056
<i>Standby. Attention! Préparez-vous.</i>

16:45.936 --> 16:47.016
Get ready.

16:48.096 --> 16:48.936
Come on.

16:50.656 --> 16:52.936
We'll cut the lead cable
when we get the word.

16:53.016 --> 16:55.336
Haven't they had time to find the bomb?

16:55.496 --> 16:59.016
Of course not. They haven't.
We've been watching them all the time.

17:08.536 --> 17:10.256
<i>Vas-y! Go. Now!</i>

17:20.976 --> 17:23.415
- It started!
- Oh, my God.

17:55.176 --> 17:56.776
I believe this is your floor.

17:57.256 --> 17:58.936
Thank God.

17:59.736 --> 18:01.576
How did I get myself into this?

18:04.576 --> 18:06.216
- Are you all right?
- Yes.

18:07.576 --> 18:11.096
- A bomb! There's a bomb up there!
- I know.

19:39.976 --> 19:42.456
<i>Fresh melons here! Nice fresh melons...</i>

19:50.976 --> 19:51.976
Hi, Lois.

19:52.776 --> 19:54.056
Hi, Clark.

20:05.136 --> 20:06.056
Clark!

20:07.336 --> 20:10.936
<i>- Have you ever heard of crosswalks?
- Yeah, but you know, I mean...</i>

20:11.416 --> 20:13.296
Do you have any idea how stupid that was?

20:14.336 --> 20:15.336
Freak!

20:18.296 --> 20:20.616
Clark, you were lucky that time.

20:21.016 --> 20:24.616
You must more careful. To cross
the street you've got to look both ways.

20:24.696 --> 20:26.616
Lois, usually I do.

20:38.176 --> 20:40.696
Maybe you ought to
get your glasses checked.

20:42.736 --> 20:46.456
Not everybody can have
"x-ray vision," you know.

20:47.776 --> 20:50.336
Do I detect a note of jealousy
in that voice?

20:50.576 --> 20:53.496
Jealousy? No, not me.

20:56.256 --> 20:58.176
Golly Lois, what are you doing?

20:58.296 --> 21:01.016
When was the last time
you heard me sneeze?

21:01.296 --> 21:03.816
You are never going to
hear me sneeze again!

21:04.696 --> 21:08.216
I read this book,
and it says if you get 1,000 milligrams...

21:08.296 --> 21:11.816
...of vitamin C every day,
you stay in perfect health.

21:11.896 --> 21:14.856
Golly, 1,000?
That's certainly a lot of oranges, isn't it?

21:15.576 --> 21:20.336
- There are pills, you know. I've seen them.
- Pills. That's the modern way to do things.

21:20.656 --> 21:22.656
This is natural.

21:23.536 --> 21:25.536
Besides, I get my exercise that way.

21:26.936 --> 21:29.936
And Clark, you don't have to be jealous.

21:30.856 --> 21:31.616
I don't?

21:32.056 --> 21:34.256
No, you've got so much going for you.

21:34.696 --> 21:35.656
I do?

21:35.696 --> 21:38.616
Do you mind if I give you
a little constructive criticism?

21:38.696 --> 21:42.256
- Actually, yes.
- Be more aggressive! You have to...

21:42.576 --> 21:46.176
...go from the instinct. You see something,
you want it, you go for it!

21:46.256 --> 21:47.296
That's what I do.

21:47.736 --> 21:48.936
Yes, I've noticed.

21:49.336 --> 21:52.736
- Perhaps I could help you there.
- Thanks, that would be great.

21:53.216 --> 21:54.456
Let's see.

21:56.096 --> 21:58.776
You put the orange in there.
That's very clever.

22:02.136 --> 22:03.176
Clark...

22:04.936 --> 22:09.376
...you know that I wouldn't say
all those things if I didn't really care.

22:11.776 --> 22:12.896
You do?

22:15.256 --> 22:16.736
What else are friends for?

22:18.976 --> 22:19.856
"Friends"?

22:24.296 --> 22:25.296
Here.

22:27.336 --> 22:28.736
Here's to friendship.

22:50.736 --> 22:53.776
This is how it ends for
the greatest criminal mind of our time.

22:53.856 --> 22:55.856
Not with a whimper. Not with a bang.

22:56.336 --> 22:58.696
How do they choose
to reward Lex Luthor...

22:59.056 --> 23:00.976
...the greatest genius in this world?

23:01.136 --> 23:05.176
Do they give him glory or treasure?
What, matter of fact, do they give him?

23:05.216 --> 23:08.056
Life plus 25, Luthor. Get to work.

23:13.616 --> 23:16.336
Don't feel bad, Mr. Luthor.
It almost worked.

23:16.496 --> 23:19.416
I mean, California almost
fell down right in the ocean.

23:19.496 --> 23:21.336
Millions of people almost died.

23:21.456 --> 23:24.536
<i>If it hadn't been for Superman,
that overgrown Boy Scout...</i>

23:24.616 --> 23:26.696
I want my Liberace record back tonight.

23:26.776 --> 23:29.696
What are you going to do
with a guy like that?

23:29.976 --> 23:32.456
He flies around so fast and everything.

23:34.216 --> 23:37.216
I mean they can't even trace
that guy on that radar they got.

23:37.456 --> 23:40.616
Every time they try he just flies off.

23:40.736 --> 23:42.056
- Where?
- North.

23:42.296 --> 23:43.216
Why?

23:44.256 --> 23:45.496
To ski?

23:47.656 --> 23:49.456
Every man has his vulnerable point.

23:49.536 --> 23:52.096
Some, like you Otis, have more than one.

23:52.736 --> 23:54.496
I didn't see Superman's in time.

23:54.856 --> 23:57.576
But now through patience,
invention, and skill...

23:59.576 --> 24:02.336
...my little black box is just about ready.

24:03.096 --> 24:05.456
Oh! That little black box in our cell.

24:09.136 --> 24:11.296
That little black box, Mr. Luthor.

24:12.696 --> 24:14.176
What's it for?

24:14.856 --> 24:19.536
That little black box
goes beyond any conventional radar.

24:20.616 --> 24:22.456
It tracks alpha waves.

24:25.336 --> 24:26.736
Alpha waves.

24:33.376 --> 24:37.296
Those alpha waves will take me north
to his secret.

24:39.336 --> 24:42.136
And his secret will give me Superman.

24:45.256 --> 24:48.576
<i>The MAB is 196 at. 5.</i>

24:48.776 --> 24:51.016
<i>We ought to see the old beauty when we...</i>

24:53.216 --> 24:57.096
You follow the bouncing ball for a while.
It's giving me a headache.

24:57.536 --> 25:00.496
Anyway, somebody's got to check up
on those guys.

25:00.856 --> 25:02.936
Yeah, I keep forgetting about them.

25:03.856 --> 25:05.976
How long they been up there, 45 days?

25:06.776 --> 25:08.736
The whole world's forgotten about us.

25:12.176 --> 25:13.936
Houston calling Artemis II.

25:15.016 --> 25:16.976
Houston calling Artemis II, come in.

25:17.616 --> 25:18.776
<i>'Morning, Houston.</i>

25:18.896 --> 25:20.216
<i>Hold on, Nate.</i>

25:20.696 --> 25:22.536
<i>- Yo!
- How are things going?</i>

25:23.656 --> 25:25.456
All systems normal, Houston.

25:26.016 --> 25:28.696
<i>Andy is out doing the geological survey...</i>

25:28.936 --> 25:30.296
<i>More rocks.</i>

25:31.616 --> 25:34.376
And Cosmonaut Boris
is getting some soil samples.

25:34.936 --> 25:37.336
By the way, Boris and I are engaged.

25:37.936 --> 25:40.976
I had a feeling about you guys
when I saw your Rorschach tests.

25:41.376 --> 25:43.616
Just a little détente humor there, Houston.

25:43.696 --> 25:45.536
<i>Surface conditions unchanged?</i>

25:45.816 --> 25:48.496
It's mighty pretty out there. Mighty...

25:50.896 --> 25:51.736
...pretty.

25:52.376 --> 25:54.176
<i>Mighty pretty, right.</i>

25:55.816 --> 25:56.976
<i>Look, Nate...</i>

25:57.776 --> 25:59.416
<i>Nate, wake up, will you?</i>

25:59.696 --> 26:01.696
That's it. I'm dreaming.

26:02.336 --> 26:03.616
<i>Artemis, come in.</i>

26:05.336 --> 26:08.656
Houston, we seem to have
an unidentified flying object.

26:08.896 --> 26:10.296
Unidentified?

26:11.096 --> 26:14.736
<i>- What does it look like?
- A lot like a...</i>

26:15.376 --> 26:16.536
...like a girl.

26:37.856 --> 26:38.656
You.

26:40.656 --> 26:43.896
- What kind of a creature are you?
- Just a man.

26:44.696 --> 26:45.696
A man?

27:46.456 --> 27:48.336
<i>What's your name?
Where are you from?</i>

27:48.496 --> 27:50.976
What a fragile sort of life form it is.

28:19.376 --> 28:20.856
Houston, come in. Houston!

28:30.656 --> 28:31.776
Come in, Houston.

28:35.936 --> 28:36.656
Houston!

28:48.296 --> 28:49.376
Somebody help me!

28:55.656 --> 28:58.096
- Artemis, this is Houston calling.
- What's up?

28:59.616 --> 29:02.616
- Artemis, Houston calling. Come in please.
- What's going on?

29:02.936 --> 29:05.736
- I don't know. We've lost contact.
- So?

29:06.576 --> 29:07.656
I mean really.

29:08.736 --> 29:11.056
Artemis, come in please. Houston calling.

29:11.776 --> 29:14.736
What was that he said before?
He saw a girl?

29:16.016 --> 29:19.536
- I thought he said "curl".
- What's a "curl"?

29:19.936 --> 29:24.496
Isn't that what the old Canaveral guys used
to call a comet on an east-west trajectory?

29:24.576 --> 29:27.656
How should I know?
I was in back high school in those days.

29:28.936 --> 29:32.776
Strange.
I tore those metal fibers like paper.

29:33.696 --> 29:34.896
And what he did...

29:35.376 --> 29:36.576
...was amazing!

29:37.976 --> 29:41.336
- Something is happening.
- Yes. To all of us.

29:44.416 --> 29:47.816
The closer we come
to an atmosphere with only one sun...

29:48.776 --> 29:50.096
...a yellow sun...

29:50.816 --> 29:54.536
...the more our molecular density
gives us unlimited powers!

29:54.936 --> 29:56.416
They come from there...

29:56.896 --> 29:58.536
...a place called Houston.

29:59.056 --> 30:00.776
Then we will go there too.

30:01.616 --> 30:02.856
To rule.

30:04.336 --> 30:05.856
Finally... To rule!

30:26.616 --> 30:27.856
380 out.

30:29.696 --> 30:30.936
381 out.

30:32.696 --> 30:33.936
382 out.

30:35.336 --> 30:36.576
383 out.

30:38.496 --> 30:39.736
384 out.

30:41.376 --> 30:43.016
385 out.

30:47.616 --> 30:48.536
Lights out, Luthor.

30:50.576 --> 30:52.016
I said, "Lights out! "

30:55.536 --> 30:58.776
You guys are about ten seconds away
from solitary, you know that?

31:01.296 --> 31:02.896
I told you to...

31:21.496 --> 31:23.016
Freeze, freeze!

31:36.296 --> 31:37.736
Go out there and find it.

31:39.216 --> 31:42.576
- What am I looking for?
- You'll know when you see it.

31:54.816 --> 31:56.576
I think I found it.

32:02.736 --> 32:04.096
What is it?

32:05.696 --> 32:07.696
It's a ladder, you dummy.

32:09.136 --> 32:10.456
Hi, Miss Teschmacher.

32:19.536 --> 32:20.696
Come on.

32:21.536 --> 32:22.736
Hurry up.

32:23.736 --> 32:25.256
Come on, hurry.

32:30.696 --> 32:32.976
Otis, hold that ladder, hurry up.

32:45.336 --> 32:46.456
Come up.

32:46.896 --> 32:49.256
Here I come, Mr. Luthor.

32:51.736 --> 32:54.216
Otis, we're sinking!

32:54.296 --> 32:55.616
Get off, get off!

33:40.256 --> 33:41.176
Excuse me.

33:43.856 --> 33:45.736
<i>If you'd like to carry Mrs...</i>

33:46.296 --> 33:48.176
<i>...Smith over the threshold...</i>

33:48.256 --> 33:50.256
- What?
- It's sort of traditional.

33:50.896 --> 33:53.456
<i>I can give you a hand
if you have trouble lifting...</i>

33:53.536 --> 33:54.936
No. Of course not.

33:55.056 --> 33:58.336
- Honey. Thanks, I'll walk.
- Certainly, dear.

34:00.776 --> 34:04.576
- Here you are.
- Sure is pink.

34:05.496 --> 34:07.216
Careful with the bags, please.

34:07.296 --> 34:09.176
First visit to Honeymoon Haven?

34:09.216 --> 34:11.295
- Yes.
- Together, anyway.

34:12.335 --> 34:13.255
Yes.

34:13.335 --> 34:15.936
Let me just show you
some of our special features.

34:16.016 --> 34:20.016
These are our "Flames of Love,"
exclusive with this motel in the area.

34:20.536 --> 34:23.255
If you want the flames to go higher,
you just pull this.

34:23.496 --> 34:24.456
I see.

34:24.856 --> 34:27.295
- Look dear, that's kind of romantic.
- In July?

34:29.176 --> 34:29.976
Honey?

34:30.416 --> 34:33.255
For a nominal charge,
our staff photographer will be happy...

34:33.335 --> 34:37.056
...to prepare a special souvenir album
of your honeymoon stay.

34:37.176 --> 34:40.576
He'll photograph you
in some of our more intimate locations...

34:40.656 --> 34:43.656
<i>...in the "tub for two",
on the bear skin rug...</i>

34:43.815 --> 34:45.616
Gee, reaI polyester!

34:45.815 --> 34:47.896
And here's the bed.

34:48.176 --> 34:49.775
Right. Thank you.

34:49.976 --> 34:51.295
Thank you, sir.

34:52.376 --> 34:53.856
Of course.

34:57.096 --> 34:59.536
- Thank you.
- Thank you, sir. And have a happy...

35:00.656 --> 35:01.656
...whatever.

35:06.016 --> 35:07.376
Can you believe this?

35:07.936 --> 35:11.896
Posing as newlyweds to expose
a honeymoon racket in Niagara Falls!

35:13.616 --> 35:16.656
What a waste of a great writer. Writers.

35:17.816 --> 35:20.816
Perry White
and his Sunday magazine exposés.

35:20.936 --> 35:24.296
How am I supposed to get a Pulitzer Prize
writing about a pink bear?

35:24.376 --> 35:27.016
I don't know,
I think this should be exposed.

35:27.176 --> 35:30.616
They get kids who are just
starting out and take them for every cent.

35:30.696 --> 35:32.696
That's what Mr. White says.

35:33.816 --> 35:37.536
On the other hand, this is kind of nice.
"Complimentary Champagne. "

35:37.976 --> 35:39.936
- Kissing contest tonight.
- Really?

35:40.056 --> 35:42.696
Lois would... No.

35:43.816 --> 35:45.336
Look at this.

35:45.576 --> 35:48.096
Lois? Gee.

35:50.176 --> 35:52.256
Look, I found a complimentary corsage.

35:52.416 --> 35:55.376
Everything's complimentary here
until you get the bill.

35:58.496 --> 36:00.496
Gee, you look very pretty.

36:01.696 --> 36:04.896
- Thank you, Clark.
- Sure.

36:06.296 --> 36:10.536
You know, Lois,
I was sort of thinking, later on...

36:12.016 --> 36:16.096
...I was just wondering what you
wanted to do about the arrangements.

36:16.536 --> 36:18.216
What arrangements, Clark?

36:20.296 --> 36:23.536
I was thinking primarily about the...

36:24.536 --> 36:26.416
...the sleeping arrangements.

36:27.456 --> 36:28.536
Mr. Smith...

36:30.416 --> 36:32.416
<i>- ... The complimentary couch.
- Right.</i>

36:34.096 --> 36:35.056
What?

36:39.976 --> 36:41.736
Gosh, it's alive.

36:46.776 --> 36:48.936
Very good, Miss Teschmacher. Very good!

36:49.016 --> 36:51.056
Why am I here? What am I doing here?

36:51.296 --> 36:54.696
Miss Teschmacher,
is this a philosophy seminar?

36:55.816 --> 36:56.576
No.

36:56.656 --> 36:57.816
This is a getaway.

36:57.896 --> 36:59.096
- Getaway?
- Right.

36:59.536 --> 37:01.776
Lex, how could you do that to Otis?

37:02.016 --> 37:03.736
What else is ballast for?

37:04.536 --> 37:05.776
Miss Teschmacher...

37:06.576 --> 37:09.016
...north. Due north.

37:10.616 --> 37:12.696
Right, north.

37:33.016 --> 37:36.096
- Where's Jimmy Olsen when I need him?
- Isn't it beautiful?

37:36.376 --> 37:38.536
Just gorgeous. Gorgeous.

37:39.416 --> 37:40.696
- Lois?
- Yes?

37:40.776 --> 37:45.296
Everybody's holding hands.
Maybe we should hold hands, too?

37:45.856 --> 37:48.016
- Here's my hand Clark, hold it.
- Thanks.

37:49.776 --> 37:52.416
You know what? They're afraid to let go.

37:52.576 --> 37:55.456
- Why?
- If they let go, straight to the lawyer.

37:55.616 --> 37:58.536
I don't know about that.
They look kind of happy to me.

37:58.576 --> 37:59.896
Because you're blind.

38:01.376 --> 38:02.336
Yeah.

38:02.456 --> 38:04.656
- Here.
- No, I've got it.

38:05.256 --> 38:08.536
You've got to look after yourself.
You've only got one pair of eyes.

38:09.256 --> 38:10.216
<i>Lois...</i>

38:10.376 --> 38:11.256
Here.

38:11.336 --> 38:13.496
<i>- Right.
- Don't say I never did anything...</i>

38:13.576 --> 38:14.536
Thank you.

38:18.336 --> 38:19.736
Son! Excuse me, please.

38:20.136 --> 38:21.136
Be careful!

38:21.216 --> 38:23.136
Get down. Get down!

38:26.656 --> 38:29.296
You're embarrassing me
in front of everybody.

38:32.096 --> 38:35.136
<i>Did you see what almost happened there?
That little boy...</i>

38:37.416 --> 38:39.296
I'm hungry. Are you hungry?

38:39.656 --> 38:42.056
- Lois, you're amazing.
- Because I'm hungry?

38:42.296 --> 38:46.096
No, I mean here you stand with one
of nature's most awesome spectacles...

38:46.176 --> 38:49.056
...and you're thinking about food.
Aren't you impressed?

38:49.776 --> 38:54.696
Once a girl's seen Superman in action,
Niagara Falls kind of leaves you cold.

38:54.776 --> 38:56.816
- You know what I mean?
- Him again?

38:58.456 --> 38:59.576
I'm sorry.

39:00.336 --> 39:02.256
I have a one-track mind, don't I?

39:03.536 --> 39:05.856
My one track mind's
telling me that I'm hungry.

39:05.936 --> 39:07.776
- Hot dog?
- Hot dog.

39:08.696 --> 39:12.376
- Could I have some orange juice?
- Freshly squeezed, I know.

39:19.976 --> 39:21.056
Mom, look!

39:22.096 --> 39:23.696
Yeah, honey, that's nice.

39:34.136 --> 39:35.096
Oh, my God!

39:36.576 --> 39:37.496
Help!

39:41.376 --> 39:42.536
Somebody help!

39:58.496 --> 40:00.296
Way to go, Superman!

40:06.056 --> 40:07.816
What a nice man!

40:21.736 --> 40:24.176
- There you go.
- Again! Again!

40:24.416 --> 40:26.896
I'm sorry. Only one ride to a customer.

40:27.736 --> 40:31.056
Superman! Superman, it's me, Lois!

40:31.856 --> 40:34.856
<i>Come here. You're going to get it!
Give me a heart attack...</i>

40:34.936 --> 40:38.856
It's me. It's Lois. Lois Lane.

40:41.376 --> 40:42.736
Hello and goodbye.

40:43.376 --> 40:46.896
What's the hurry, seeing as you
happen to be in Niagara Falls?

40:48.696 --> 40:51.256
<i>Happen to be in Niagara Falls...</i>

40:52.216 --> 40:53.656
<i>And, Clark...</i>

40:54.856 --> 40:57.256
Clark is not around as usual.

41:12.696 --> 41:13.936
Lois?

41:17.536 --> 41:19.536
- Here you go.
- Where were you?

41:19.976 --> 41:22.256
I was getting hot dogs.
What do you mean?

41:22.976 --> 41:27.216
It just seems kind of strange to me
that every time Superman's around, you...

41:27.376 --> 41:28.496
...disappear.

41:28.776 --> 41:31.656
Superman? You mean he was here?
Golly!

41:32.456 --> 41:34.696
And you weren't. As usual.

41:36.256 --> 41:40.216
- What have you got to say about that?
- Darn, I forgot your orange juice.

41:40.416 --> 41:41.616
Clark!

41:43.456 --> 41:44.536
No orange juice?

41:54.936 --> 41:58.256
- Mush! Mush!
- I am mushing.

41:58.856 --> 42:01.936
Ice and snow:
Is this your idea of a good time?

42:02.256 --> 42:06.816
A good time? Is that all you care about?
North, Miss Teschmacher.

42:07.256 --> 42:09.896
North!

42:10.216 --> 42:11.736
Yes, Lex, north.

42:12.256 --> 42:15.496
Look. It's his home.
It's Superman's home.

42:15.936 --> 42:17.616
Good, more ice.

42:23.776 --> 42:25.656
- Fantastic!
- Fantastic.

42:26.456 --> 42:28.696
It's fantastic!

42:31.736 --> 42:35.456
The construction goes far beyond
any known architectural theory.

42:36.456 --> 42:38.576
- It's beautiful.
- Beautiful.

42:48.696 --> 42:50.896
- This place is genius!
- Genius.

42:54.816 --> 42:56.776
- Lex!
- I'll be all right.

42:56.976 --> 42:58.136
No, me.

43:01.536 --> 43:03.136
Why can't you be more carefuI?

43:05.656 --> 43:07.536
- This is beautiful.
- BeautifuI.

43:07.616 --> 43:09.256
- It has everything.
- Wrong.

43:11.416 --> 43:15.016
- Why didn't you go before we left?
- That was two days ago.

43:22.056 --> 43:24.536
This looks like some kind of control panel.

43:28.616 --> 43:30.976
- Don't touch anything.
- Don't touch anything.

43:32.456 --> 43:35.296
- Ice.
- I said don't touch it.

43:36.336 --> 43:38.696
- It's not ice.
- It looks like a crystal.

43:45.656 --> 43:50.616
<i>Kryptonian memory bank,
education crystal #308.</i>

43:52.176 --> 43:54.256
- I told you it was a crystal.
- Shut up!

43:54.496 --> 43:56.376
<i>Earth culture, Section B.</i>

43:57.336 --> 44:01.216
<i>"Trees" by Joyce Kilmer,
of the Planet Earth.</i>

44:02.176 --> 44:02.976
What?

44:03.256 --> 44:07.576
<i>"I think that I shall never see
a poem lovely as a tree...</i>

44:09.296 --> 44:13.696

That's cute. That's very cute.

44:14.776 --> 44:17.016
<i>"... A tree that looks at God all day"...</i>

44:17.856 --> 44:19.336
I like trees!

44:19.696 --> 44:23.016
So does your average cocker spaniel.
Give me another one.

44:23.656 --> 44:25.616
No. The big one there.

44:35.376 --> 44:36.936
<i>Kal-El, my son...</i>

44:37.816 --> 44:40.136
<i>...as the Keeper

44:40.176 --> 44:44.256
<i>...it falls to me to tell you of the darkest
episode in our planet's history.</i>

44:44.776 --> 44:46.176
Now this I want to hear.

44:46.216 --> 44:50.056
<i>After many eons of harmony, there
appeared among us three rebel elements...</i>

44:50.136 --> 44:52.456
<i>...what you would call on Earth,

44:52.536 --> 44:54.656
Criminals? My kind of people.

44:55.096 --> 45:00.136

change their evil natures, their evil ways.</i>

45:00.656 --> 45:02.656
<i>As you know, we hath no death penalty.</i>

45:02.856 --> 45:03.936
Sensible enough.

45:04.016 --> 45:06.176
<i>Therefore, our scientists constructed...</i>

45:06.736 --> 45:08.496
<i>..."The Phantom Zone".</i>

45:09.176 --> 45:12.336
<i>In it, we placed
these three arch-criminals...</i>

45:12.976 --> 45:15.696
<i>...imprisoning them there for all eternity.</i>

45:16.216 --> 45:18.096
No possibility for parole?

45:18.616 --> 45:22.016
<i>Your father, Jor-El,
thought long and hard upon that question.</i>

45:22.896 --> 45:24.376
I asked the right question.

45:24.456 --> 45:27.936
<i>There is one danger.
The Phantom Zone might...</i>

45:28.736 --> 45:32.576
<i>...just might, be cracked
by a nuclear explosion in space.</i>

45:34.776 --> 45:36.616
<i>I wish you hadn't asked me that...</i>

45:37.816 --> 45:39.136
I didn't ask anything.

45:39.176 --> 45:42.376
<i>We do not know
what would happen if they were to escape.</i>

45:42.936 --> 45:46.216
<i>On Krypton,
these villains were uncontrollable.</i>

45:47.176 --> 45:51.776
<i>On Earth, they would have the same
powers, each one of them...</i>

45:52.216 --> 45:53.296
<i>...that you have.</i>

45:53.936 --> 45:54.936
Think of it.

45:55.056 --> 45:56.496
<i>- The first of the three...
- Three.</i>

45:56.576 --> 46:00.096
<i>- ... is their leader, General Zod.
- Count them, three super-villains.</i>

46:00.176 --> 46:04.296
<i>- Together with Non and Ursa...
- Each one with the same power he has.</i>

46:05.376 --> 46:08.536
Each one totally dedicated to corruption,
violence, and evil.

46:08.736 --> 46:12.936
Wait. That explains the three Alpha Waves
I've been getting on my black box.

46:13.376 --> 46:15.056
They'll need a contact here on Earth.

46:15.136 --> 46:18.936
Someone with the same contempt for life,
liberty and the pursuit of happiness.

46:18.976 --> 46:20.336
South, Miss Teschmacher!

46:21.216 --> 46:22.776
You know, it's really amazing.

46:22.856 --> 46:26.736
I never started to put it together
before now. It's just kind of funny...

46:26.816 --> 46:29.736
...because a good reporter
can't let anything slip by her.

46:29.816 --> 46:33.536
- Of course not.
- I'm beginning to get the picture.

46:35.856 --> 46:39.296
As usual, Lois, I really don't know
what you're talking about.

46:40.576 --> 46:43.216
Tell you what,
I'll meet you back at the hotel.

46:43.496 --> 46:45.056
What's your hurry, Superman?

46:48.776 --> 46:49.656
Sorry?

46:52.616 --> 46:56.136
I've got to admit, your disguise is
nearly perfect. You had me fooled.

46:56.496 --> 46:58.696
And I am nobody's fool, believe me.

46:58.936 --> 47:00.296
No, of course not.

47:00.416 --> 47:04.016
You just have an active imagination.
You get carried away sometimes.

47:04.056 --> 47:06.616
- I understand. It can happen to anybody.
- Listen...

47:07.376 --> 47:11.536
...I'm so sure that you're Superman
that I'm willing to bet my life on it.

47:12.096 --> 47:12.896
What?

47:14.576 --> 47:16.896
If I'm right, you'll turn into Superman.

47:18.136 --> 47:19.816
If I'm wrong...

47:20.336 --> 47:22.896
...you've got yourself one hell of a story.

47:24.616 --> 47:27.296
You think I'm Superman?

47:27.856 --> 47:30.016
Boy, you certainly have some imagination.

47:30.216 --> 47:32.976
For a minute, you almost
had me convinced. For a minute.

47:33.056 --> 47:35.016
Bye-bye, baby.

47:39.856 --> 47:41.016
Oh, my god!

47:45.016 --> 47:46.376
Excuse me, please.

47:46.576 --> 47:47.536
Help!

47:57.976 --> 47:59.576
Superman!

48:02.256 --> 48:03.576
Lois, swim!

48:04.776 --> 48:05.856
Help!

48:07.016 --> 48:09.376
Look out for the rocks! Oh, God!

48:10.776 --> 48:11.936
Clark!

48:36.736 --> 48:38.776
- Grab that branch!
- What?

48:45.736 --> 48:46.936
Help!

49:06.816 --> 49:08.336
Lois, you all right?

49:19.696 --> 49:21.296
Here!

49:34.216 --> 49:37.816
- You were what I thought was Superman?
- Sorry.

49:39.056 --> 49:41.136
This is really embarrassing.

50:10.456 --> 50:12.496
So this is planet Houston?

50:15.936 --> 50:17.936
A very strange surface.

51:02.296 --> 51:04.536
A primitive sort of life form.

51:15.496 --> 51:16.936
Did you see that?

51:18.256 --> 51:19.656
Did you see what I did?

51:20.656 --> 51:23.056
I have powers beyond reason here.

51:23.856 --> 51:25.616
We all have them, my dear.

51:46.296 --> 51:48.856
I must've looked like an idiot...

51:49.296 --> 51:52.096
...jumping in the river,
waiting for Mr. WonderfuI...

51:53.176 --> 51:55.456
...who obviously had better things to do.

51:57.216 --> 52:00.256
I'm sure it must've been
something very important, Lois.

52:00.656 --> 52:02.736
<i>And then thinking you were...</i>

52:05.216 --> 52:07.096
<i>If Perry White could see me now...</i>

52:11.496 --> 52:12.776
Where's my comb?

52:17.016 --> 52:20.256
God, not only have I lost my mind,
I lost my comb.

52:20.536 --> 52:23.136
Can you pass me that brush over there?

52:23.376 --> 52:24.336
Sure.

52:34.776 --> 52:37.976
- No. It's okay.
- Let me see your hand. Give it to me.

52:38.056 --> 52:40.376
- No. It's all right, Lois.
- Let me look at it.

52:52.136 --> 52:55.336
- You are Superman.
- Come on, don't be silly.

53:16.816 --> 53:17.816
I'm sorry.

53:19.296 --> 53:21.776
No, you don't have anything
to be sorry about.

53:25.496 --> 53:27.016
I don't know why I did that.

53:27.976 --> 53:29.216
Maybe you wanted to.

53:30.456 --> 53:31.656
I don't think I did.

53:34.056 --> 53:39.056
Maybe you didn't want to with your mind,
but maybe you wanted to with your heart.

53:44.336 --> 53:45.496
We'd better talk.

53:51.976 --> 53:53.336
I'm in love with you.

53:57.056 --> 53:58.656
We really better talk.

54:00.896 --> 54:01.936
I'm listening.

54:03.496 --> 54:07.336
We can't talk here. Perry will call
at about 6:00 to find out what's happening.

54:07.776 --> 54:11.456
"What's happening"?
That's the understatement of the year.

54:17.056 --> 54:19.896
Where do you want to... Talk?

54:26.976 --> 54:27.976
Lois...

54:31.256 --> 54:34.056
...now that you know,
I think you should know it all.

54:34.856 --> 54:35.936
I want to.

54:38.256 --> 54:39.496
Let's go to my place.

54:43.216 --> 54:44.896
Maybe I should change first.

54:50.736 --> 54:52.216
Maybe you should, too.

55:20.456 --> 55:23.976
- They have a wide selection.
- I can't eat fish.

55:24.696 --> 55:28.296
You can eat anything you want, Duane.
You can eat meat and potatoes.

55:28.736 --> 55:31.536
I couldn't go anywhere
where I was expected to eat fish.

55:31.656 --> 55:33.176
They got beans.

55:33.696 --> 55:36.976
I can't eat beans.
I come out in a rash if I eat beans.

55:37.096 --> 55:41.736
Look, Duane, they have a wide selection.

55:43.656 --> 55:45.536
I think I'll try the fish.

55:52.656 --> 55:56.976
I don't know, from the look of them,
I'll bet $10 they're from Los Angeles.

56:02.256 --> 56:05.416
Hey, hippies! Get your butts off the road!

56:06.496 --> 56:09.576
I like the globe that flashes red
like our Krypton sun.

56:10.096 --> 56:12.176
But not this irritating noise.

56:12.896 --> 56:13.776
Make way!

56:15.696 --> 56:19.296
Did I hear right?
Did that son of a bitch give me an order?

56:19.856 --> 56:21.816
Duane, you take care of it.

56:21.896 --> 56:22.936
But...

56:23.216 --> 56:26.496
You got to learn to kick ass
if you want to be a peacemaker.

56:34.856 --> 56:38.616
All right. Just what in the hell
do you think you're doing here?

56:39.216 --> 56:42.856
What is this symbol?
Do you follow another leader?

56:43.416 --> 56:44.816
Follow the leader?

56:46.736 --> 56:48.496
Holy skunk sweat!

56:49.376 --> 56:51.536
- All right.
- A weapon of some sort?

57:01.856 --> 57:03.696
How in the hell did you do that?

57:11.416 --> 57:12.736
Jesus H. Christ!

57:14.656 --> 57:16.296
Crude noise-maker.

57:32.616 --> 57:34.176
<i>Just checking the tire...</i>

58:39.096 --> 58:41.616
- Wow, this is your home!
- No.

58:42.416 --> 58:45.216
Actually, I live in the city,
about three blocks from you.

58:47.096 --> 58:49.416
This is a very special place for me.

58:49.776 --> 58:51.176
I wanted you to see it.

58:52.336 --> 58:53.896
Listen, you warm enough?

58:55.656 --> 58:57.816
I guess I should be freezing, but I'm not.

58:57.896 --> 59:00.776
Good. Come on, let me show you.

59:39.776 --> 59:42.136
You see? You only smell strong.

59:46.576 --> 59:48.016
Baby!

59:51.536 --> 59:54.656
It's only because I didn't want to
lose my place in the orchestra.

59:57.696 --> 01:00:00.176
The circus is in town!

01:00:02.456 --> 01:00:05.896
Hey, sweet thing!
Set them buns down here!

01:00:12.376 --> 01:00:14.016
Let's just hold hands.

01:00:18.616 --> 01:00:20.376
Let me know if this tickles.

01:00:28.816 --> 01:00:31.696
Your right front tire is flat, Duane.

01:00:37.336 --> 01:00:39.496
Sheriff, what happened?

01:00:41.056 --> 01:00:41.976
<i>Willie...</i>

01:00:42.896 --> 01:00:44.536
I think my arm's broke.

01:00:45.696 --> 01:00:46.896
Girl or no girl...

01:00:46.976 --> 01:00:49.736
...you're going to spit teeth! Get up!

01:00:56.096 --> 01:00:57.936
What the sam hill?

01:01:03.816 --> 01:01:05.496
Is that you, Boog?

01:01:13.936 --> 01:01:14.776
All right.

01:01:15.096 --> 01:01:16.496
Get 'em up, keep 'em up!

01:01:17.056 --> 01:01:19.376
These humans are beginning to bore me.

01:01:29.976 --> 01:01:31.736
- Please, Mister!
- He's a general.

01:01:31.856 --> 01:01:34.016
Mr. General! Please let my daddy down!

01:01:40.136 --> 01:01:41.496
You okay, Jody?

01:01:44.816 --> 01:01:47.056
When my father died...

01:01:47.656 --> 01:01:49.736
...this is my Earth father, I mean...

01:01:50.896 --> 01:01:53.536
...I found this crystal.

01:01:56.416 --> 01:01:59.056
This is kind of hard to explain,
but you see...

01:01:59.696 --> 01:02:00.936
...it called to me.

01:02:03.336 --> 01:02:05.616
Yeah. And it brought me here.

01:02:06.416 --> 01:02:08.216
It helped me to build this place.

01:02:09.496 --> 01:02:11.136
Actually it built it, really.

01:02:13.096 --> 01:02:16.816
That's when I found out who I really was...

01:02:17.136 --> 01:02:18.776
...and what I had to do.

01:02:24.056 --> 01:02:25.896
So what do you think? You like it?

01:02:26.416 --> 01:02:27.416
Like it?

01:02:28.576 --> 01:02:29.976
It's incredible!

01:02:30.936 --> 01:02:34.496
I mean, not that it couldn't use
a woman's touch...

01:02:34.576 --> 01:02:36.416
...especially around dinner time.

01:02:36.496 --> 01:02:40.616
Dinner. I'm sorry.
I don't usually do too much about...

01:02:41.256 --> 01:02:44.056
Listen, tonight, sky's the limit.
Anything you want.

01:03:32.456 --> 01:03:33.376
I'm home!

01:03:35.096 --> 01:03:36.136
Should we eat?

01:03:38.456 --> 01:03:39.816
- Sure.
- Great.

01:03:43.536 --> 01:03:46.896
Good morning, America.
This is East Houston, Idaho...

01:03:46.976 --> 01:03:49.296
...until yesterday,
another middle American town...

01:03:49.376 --> 01:03:51.336
...that middle America had forgotten.

01:03:51.696 --> 01:03:55.576
But today the population,
exaggerated reports put it at 123...

01:03:55.696 --> 01:03:57.176
...has increased by three.

01:03:57.456 --> 01:04:00.496
And these three new arrivals
bring destruction in their wake.

01:04:00.576 --> 01:04:03.576
As I look west into East Houston
this morning...

01:04:03.616 --> 01:04:05.296
...I see a town gripped with...

01:04:06.096 --> 01:04:07.096
...fear.

01:04:08.816 --> 01:04:10.496
<i>Who's the big guy?</i>

01:04:11.416 --> 01:04:13.336
<i>Okay, yeah, we've got a P.O...</i>

01:04:14.336 --> 01:04:15.176
No.

01:04:15.416 --> 01:04:17.776
<i>We've got a slight crack in that diode.</i>

01:04:18.896 --> 01:04:21.456
<i>- Come in on him if you can.
- Try to wiggle it.</i>

01:04:21.536 --> 01:04:22.936
Who else is seeing this?

01:04:23.696 --> 01:04:27.856
With this satellite link up,
just about everybody. The whole planet.

01:04:27.936 --> 01:04:31.056
- The whole planet Houston?
- Earth.

01:04:31.576 --> 01:04:33.176
The whole planet Earth.

01:04:33.936 --> 01:04:35.496
<i>Get over to the commentator.</i>

01:04:35.776 --> 01:04:37.296
<i>You may continue.</i>

01:04:38.096 --> 01:04:40.976
<i>As the extraordinary story continues...</i>

01:04:42.816 --> 01:04:44.816
<i>As this extraordinary story...</i>

01:04:44.896 --> 01:04:48.776
If the whole planet is watching, can't we
show them something more interesting?

01:04:48.816 --> 01:04:51.296
<i>Throw down your arms and surrender!</i>

01:04:51.816 --> 01:04:53.416
<i>This is an order!</i>

01:04:56.456 --> 01:04:59.776
GeneraI Zod does not take orders.
He gives them.

01:05:24.616 --> 01:05:26.016
You all right, buddy?

01:05:55.056 --> 01:05:58.016
He was right in the line of fire
and nothing happened to him!

01:05:58.056 --> 01:06:00.456
I haven't seen the likes of this
since Superman.

01:06:01.256 --> 01:06:05.216
<i>Yes. The Newsbeat control room
has just informed me...</i>

01:06:05.296 --> 01:06:08.296
<i>...that a fleet of helicopter gun ships
is on it's way...</i>

01:06:08.376 --> 01:06:11.856
<i>- Mr. President, can't we...
- I'm afraid there's nothing anybody can do.</i>

01:06:11.936 --> 01:06:14.336
They have such powers,
nothing can stop them.

01:06:14.576 --> 01:06:17.096
Where's Superman? Where is he?

01:06:17.416 --> 01:06:18.976
Why doesn't he do something?

01:06:19.536 --> 01:06:22.776
General Smythson has informed us
that nuclear weapon strikes...

01:06:22.896 --> 01:06:26.736
...have been ruled out because of
the danger to the civilian population.

01:06:35.856 --> 01:06:37.256
<i>Starting firing run now.</i>

01:06:39.816 --> 01:06:41.296
<i>Standby, rockets.</i>

01:06:42.016 --> 01:06:42.816
<i>Fire one.</i>

01:06:46.136 --> 01:06:47.216
<i>Fire again.</i>

01:06:49.256 --> 01:06:50.256
<i>Fire again.</i>

01:06:58.656 --> 01:07:00.536
<i>The rockets didn't have any effect.</i>

01:07:01.536 --> 01:07:04.616
Look, they need machines to fly!

01:07:07.136 --> 01:07:08.376
What bravery!

01:07:09.016 --> 01:07:11.656
Be nice to them, my dear.
Blow them a kiss.

01:07:20.656 --> 01:07:23.256
<i>We're out of control. I don't understand.</i>

01:07:25.696 --> 01:07:28.176
<i>We're coming in... Coming down...
can't control it!</i>

01:07:28.856 --> 01:07:30.536
<i>We're coming down!</i>

01:07:44.296 --> 01:07:45.176
I win.

01:07:47.696 --> 01:07:48.696
I always win.

01:07:50.736 --> 01:07:53.656
<i>Is there no one on this planet
to even challenge me?</i>

01:08:00.176 --> 01:08:01.976
That was good.

01:08:02.416 --> 01:08:04.096
I thought we might...

01:08:05.776 --> 01:08:07.736
...abandon the orange juice for once.

01:08:15.816 --> 01:08:18.536
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

01:08:22.776 --> 01:08:25.055
Must be tough being Clark Kent, isn't it?

01:08:26.256 --> 01:08:27.296
No.

01:08:29.216 --> 01:08:30.856
I really like it sometimes.

01:08:31.456 --> 01:08:33.736
Even though I do make a fool of myself.

01:08:35.416 --> 01:08:37.416
You know, if it weren't for him...

01:08:38.256 --> 01:08:39.856
...I never would have met you.

01:08:41.736 --> 01:08:44.216
But... He is you.

01:08:46.015 --> 01:08:47.816
It's kind of confusing.

01:08:49.696 --> 01:08:51.015
Not to me, it isn't.

01:08:53.776 --> 01:08:55.536
For the first time in my life...

01:08:56.975 --> 01:08:58.296
...everything's clear.

01:09:22.816 --> 01:09:25.895
I'm going to go change into something
more comfortable.

01:09:40.696 --> 01:09:44.296
Come forward.
Your general wishes to speak.

01:09:44.696 --> 01:09:46.776
I am General Zod.

01:09:47.776 --> 01:09:48.776
Your ruler.

01:09:50.296 --> 01:09:53.696
Yes, today begins a new order!

01:09:54.576 --> 01:09:58.376
Your lands, your possessions,
your very lives...

01:09:58.456 --> 01:10:02.136
...will gladly be given
in tribute to me, General Zod!

01:10:02.976 --> 01:10:04.736
In return for your obedience...

01:10:04.816 --> 01:10:07.776
...you will enjoy my generous protection.

01:10:07.856 --> 01:10:10.816
In other words, you will be allowed to live.

01:10:14.296 --> 01:10:16.256
<i>So you are a general...</i>

01:10:18.336 --> 01:10:20.336
And who is your superior?

01:10:21.256 --> 01:10:25.376
- I answer only to the president.
- And he will answer to me...

01:10:27.576 --> 01:10:30.776
...or all of his cities
will end up like this one!

01:10:31.736 --> 01:10:35.376
<i>Your father and I have tried to anticipate
your every question, Kal-El.</i>

01:10:35.616 --> 01:10:38.096
<i>This is the one we hoped
you would not ask.</i>

01:10:38.576 --> 01:10:42.536
But I have to, because...
she's everything I want in life.

01:10:43.896 --> 01:10:46.216
<i>And she, the one you have chosen...</i>

01:10:47.096 --> 01:10:49.096
<i>...she feels as much for you?</i>

01:10:50.136 --> 01:10:50.976
Yes.

01:10:51.056 --> 01:10:52.816
<i>Then if this is what you wish...</i>

01:10:53.336 --> 01:10:56.016
<i>...if you intend to live your life
with a mortal...</i>

01:10:56.576 --> 01:10:59.096
<i>...you must live as a mortal.</i>

01:10:59.656 --> 01:11:01.536
<i>You must become one of them.</i>

01:11:03.416 --> 01:11:07.976
<i>This crystal chamber has harnessed
the rays of the red sun of Krypton.</i>

01:11:08.856 --> 01:11:11.376
<i>Once exposed to these rays, all...</i>

01:11:11.456 --> 01:11:15.016
<i>...your great powers on Earth
will disappear forever.</i>

01:11:20.296 --> 01:11:21.696
<i>But consider...</i>

01:11:22.336 --> 01:11:24.376
<i>...once it is done, there is no return.</i>

01:11:24.856 --> 01:11:26.776
<i>You will become an ordinary man.</i>

01:11:27.336 --> 01:11:29.736
<i>You will feel like an ordinary man.</i>

01:11:30.496 --> 01:11:33.456
<i>You can be hurt like an ordinary man.</i>

01:11:44.136 --> 01:11:47.056
<i>My son, are you sure?</i>

01:11:54.776 --> 01:11:55.816
Mother...

01:11:57.416 --> 01:11:58.776
...I love her.

01:13:48.896 --> 01:13:50.576
You did all that for me?

01:13:53.696 --> 01:13:55.536
I don't know what to say.

01:13:57.816 --> 01:13:59.336
Just say you love me.

01:14:50.216 --> 01:14:53.936
Thousands of hours to create,
and they defaced it in seconds.

01:14:54.176 --> 01:14:57.096
Imagine what they'll do to the world
if we resist.

01:16:02.576 --> 01:16:04.456
The whole place is going to fall!

01:16:04.536 --> 01:16:05.376
Watch it!

01:16:41.456 --> 01:16:43.376
You are the one they call President?

01:16:43.976 --> 01:16:44.816
I am.

01:16:48.256 --> 01:16:51.496
I see you are practiced
in worshipping things that fly.

01:16:53.056 --> 01:16:54.136
Good.

01:16:55.416 --> 01:16:56.536
Rise before Zod.

01:17:01.776 --> 01:17:04.776
Now, kneel before Zod.

01:17:18.976 --> 01:17:20.496
You are not the President.

01:17:20.856 --> 01:17:24.496
No one who leads so many
could possibly kneel so quickly.

01:17:25.896 --> 01:17:27.656
I am the man they are protecting.

01:17:28.896 --> 01:17:30.216
I am the President.

01:17:31.736 --> 01:17:33.936
I'll kneel before you if it will save lives.

01:17:34.336 --> 01:17:37.656
It will. Starting with your own.

01:17:51.416 --> 01:17:55.496
What I do now, I do for
the sake of the people of the world.

01:17:56.816 --> 01:18:00.696
But there is one man here on Earth
who will never kneel before you.

01:18:01.216 --> 01:18:03.696
Who is this imbecile? Where is he?

01:18:04.176 --> 01:18:05.296
I wish I knew.

01:18:10.776 --> 01:18:11.936
God.

01:18:12.656 --> 01:18:13.576
Zod.

01:18:17.856 --> 01:18:21.216
You're awfully quiet over there.
I'm supposed to be the shy one.

01:18:22.656 --> 01:18:25.216
Yeah, I was just thinking...

01:18:26.136 --> 01:18:29.216
...I can't believe
what you've given up for me.

01:18:30.656 --> 01:18:33.776
Are you kidding?
I didn't do it for you, Lois, I did it for us.

01:18:34.536 --> 01:18:37.776
See, I told you there'd be
a hot dog place somewhere.

01:18:37.936 --> 01:18:40.976
Okay. It sure takes longer
when you can't fly.

01:18:41.896 --> 01:18:43.136
Hurry up.

01:18:43.736 --> 01:18:45.176
- Come on.
- Okay.

01:18:46.016 --> 01:18:47.536
My back's stiff.

01:18:48.976 --> 01:18:50.776
Come on, it's my treat.

01:18:55.176 --> 01:18:57.296
Oh, boy, it's Mr. WonderfuI.

01:18:58.856 --> 01:19:00.176
Thank you.

01:19:03.616 --> 01:19:05.976
- Do you have a men's room?
- Right in the corner.

01:19:06.376 --> 01:19:08.496
- Want to sit down?
- Yeah.

01:19:11.056 --> 01:19:12.656
What would you folks like?

01:19:12.776 --> 01:19:16.136
I'd like a cheeseburger
with everything on it and a Coke...

01:19:16.296 --> 01:19:19.936
...and an order of fries
and a side salad, please.

01:19:21.256 --> 01:19:22.736
For you, sir?

01:19:23.176 --> 01:19:25.776
- I'll think about it when I get back.
- Right.

01:19:26.016 --> 01:19:28.576
- Steak and eggs, over easy, coffee.
- My Coke, please.

01:19:28.616 --> 01:19:29.576
Coming up.

01:19:30.936 --> 01:19:32.376
Sorry, that seat's taken.

01:19:32.536 --> 01:19:34.176
It is now, sweetheart.

01:19:35.696 --> 01:19:37.456
Can I buy you something to eat?

01:19:38.296 --> 01:19:39.656
No, thank you.

01:19:40.816 --> 01:19:43.056
Excuse me.
I think you're sitting in my seat.

01:19:44.016 --> 01:19:46.176
Your seat's in there, four-eyes.

01:19:49.616 --> 01:19:53.096
I think, perhaps somebody
ought to teach you some manners, sir.

01:19:54.576 --> 01:19:57.176
Yeah? Let me know when he comes in.

01:19:57.296 --> 01:19:59.456
<i>- Look, we can just...
- Honey...</i>

01:20:01.056 --> 01:20:03.416
Excuse me, sir,
would you care to step outside?

01:20:03.616 --> 01:20:06.256
I said, excuse me, sir,
would you care to step outside?

01:20:09.576 --> 01:20:12.216
Now listen, your steak's coming right up.

01:20:12.976 --> 01:20:16.296
Keep it on the flame,
this is just a minute steak.

01:20:17.936 --> 01:20:19.376
After you.

01:20:28.616 --> 01:20:30.256
You all right?

01:20:30.336 --> 01:20:32.576
He's going to be fine, just give me that.

01:20:33.896 --> 01:20:36.136
Blood. It's my blood.

01:20:37.496 --> 01:20:38.416
I think...

01:20:39.056 --> 01:20:41.776
...maybe we ought to hire a bodyguard
from now on.

01:20:42.256 --> 01:20:45.416
I don't want a bodyguard.
I want the man I fell in love with.

01:20:45.696 --> 01:20:47.096
I know that.

01:20:48.056 --> 01:20:49.856
I wish he were here.

01:20:59.016 --> 01:21:02.136
Boy, you just don't have enough sense
to stay down do you?

01:21:16.976 --> 01:21:19.216
I don't like your meat, anyway.

01:21:21.376 --> 01:21:22.776
Oh, God.

01:21:34.376 --> 01:21:35.376
Can you get up?

01:21:36.176 --> 01:21:38.136
- It's all right. I got you.
- Go slow.

01:21:38.216 --> 01:21:39.256
Try and get up in that chair.

01:21:42.216 --> 01:21:44.176
- Sit down.
- I'm all right.

01:21:47.016 --> 01:21:50.016
He's all right. Just relax.
We'll have some fresh coffee.

01:21:50.136 --> 01:21:51.936
I'll turn the box on.

01:21:53.376 --> 01:21:56.096
<i>We interrupt this program
for an urgent message...</i>

01:21:56.176 --> 01:21:58.496
<i>...from the President of the United States.</i>

01:21:59.496 --> 01:22:01.216
<i>This is your President.</i>

01:22:01.936 --> 01:22:06.536
<i>On behalf of my country and in the name
of the other leaders of the world...</i>

01:22:07.376 --> 01:22:09.536
<i>...with whom I have today consulted...</i>

01:22:10.416 --> 01:22:13.016
<i>...I hereby abdicate...</i>

01:22:13.616 --> 01:22:17.256
<i>...all authority
and control over this planet...</i>

01:22:18.376 --> 01:22:19.496
<i>...to General Zod.</i>

01:22:21.776 --> 01:22:25.416
<i>Only by strict compliance
with all his directions...</i>

01:22:26.376 --> 01:22:30.056
<i>...will the lives
of innocent millions be spared.</i>

01:22:30.816 --> 01:22:32.456
<i>Superman, can you hear me?</i>

01:22:32.536 --> 01:22:36.136
<i>- Superman, where...
- Who is this Superman?</i>

01:22:36.576 --> 01:22:38.896
<i>You'll find out! And when you do...</i>

01:22:38.976 --> 01:22:42.416
<i>Come to me, Superman! If you dare!</i>

01:22:42.856 --> 01:22:44.336
<i>I defy you!</i>

01:22:44.576 --> 01:22:47.976
<i>Come! Come and kneel before Zod!</i>

01:22:53.456 --> 01:22:55.336
- Here? When?
- When?

01:22:55.456 --> 01:22:56.656
Where have you been?

01:22:56.936 --> 01:22:58.656
On a desert island?

01:23:01.576 --> 01:23:03.256
I have to go back.

01:23:03.816 --> 01:23:05.496
You can't go back.

01:23:05.856 --> 01:23:07.976
- There's no way, now.
- I have to.

01:23:08.496 --> 01:23:11.776
I've got to try, damn it!
I've got to try something. Anything!

01:23:12.016 --> 01:23:14.096
It's not your fault.

01:23:15.056 --> 01:23:17.816
You didn't know this was going to happen.

01:23:19.616 --> 01:23:21.176
They knew.

01:23:21.736 --> 01:23:23.416
I heard them.

01:23:24.216 --> 01:23:26.216
I just didn't listen.

01:23:56.296 --> 01:23:57.936
Hey, come on!

01:24:42.576 --> 01:24:43.976
Father?

01:24:44.576 --> 01:24:45.936
Mother?

01:24:48.936 --> 01:24:51.376
I really wish you could hear me.

01:24:52.776 --> 01:24:54.536
Because I need you.

01:24:56.816 --> 01:24:58.216
See, I...

01:25:01.136 --> 01:25:02.656
<i>...I...</i>

01:25:04.016 --> 01:25:05.816
I failed.

01:25:11.336 --> 01:25:13.336
Father!

01:26:27.656 --> 01:26:29.136
You're master of all you survey.

01:26:30.456 --> 01:26:32.376
And so I was yesterday.

01:26:32.736 --> 01:26:34.456
And the day before.

01:26:49.216 --> 01:26:50.176
Hello, there.

01:26:51.896 --> 01:26:53.416
Lex Luthor.

01:26:58.736 --> 01:27:01.496
You may know the name.
The greatest criminal mind on Earth.

01:27:02.256 --> 01:27:04.696
I told you this was a puny planet.

01:27:04.976 --> 01:27:06.576
Wait, just a moment.

01:27:06.776 --> 01:27:09.736
Wait until you get to know me better,
will you, please?

01:27:10.216 --> 01:27:13.856
Wait, I can give you anything you want.

01:27:14.016 --> 01:27:17.936
I can give you the brass ring,
the unlimited freedom to maim...

01:27:18.256 --> 01:27:20.336
...kill, destroy.

01:27:21.416 --> 01:27:25.576
Plus, Lex Luthor's keen mind.
Lex Luthor's savvy.

01:27:26.216 --> 01:27:30.456
Lex Luthor's career guidance.
Lex Luthor's School of Better...

01:27:32.336 --> 01:27:34.696
We have all of this without you.

01:27:35.416 --> 01:27:37.656
You cannot bargain
with what you don't have.

01:27:38.376 --> 01:27:40.136
Magnificent One.

01:27:41.656 --> 01:27:44.736
What I am bargaining with
is what you do not have.

01:27:45.176 --> 01:27:46.416
The son of Jor-El.

01:27:46.896 --> 01:27:49.656
The son of Jor-El? On this planet?

01:27:50.456 --> 01:27:54.496
<i>Possibly you know him better
by his nom de voyage, or his...</i>

01:27:54.856 --> 01:27:56.376
...name he travels under.

01:27:56.456 --> 01:27:57.216
Superman.

01:28:00.576 --> 01:28:02.136
So, this is Superman.

01:28:03.736 --> 01:28:06.496
- How do you know of Jor-El?
- My Fullness...

01:28:06.976 --> 01:28:09.216
<i>...as I explained to you before...</i>

01:28:10.616 --> 01:28:12.016
I'm the best there is.

01:28:12.376 --> 01:28:15.576
Revenge! We will kill the son of our jailer.

01:28:15.816 --> 01:28:18.776
- Revenge!
- Revenge! Now we're cooking!

01:28:19.056 --> 01:28:20.936
- He flies?
- Constantly.

01:28:21.216 --> 01:28:24.576
<i>- He has powers as we do?
- Certainly. But...</i>

01:28:26.896 --> 01:28:30.416
Magnificent One, he's just one...

01:28:31.056 --> 01:28:32.936
...where you are three.

01:28:34.616 --> 01:28:36.256
Or four if you count him twice.

01:28:36.336 --> 01:28:38.016
We will bring him to his knees.

01:28:38.096 --> 01:28:38.776
Wait!

01:28:41.136 --> 01:28:42.296
First, you must find him.

01:28:42.816 --> 01:28:45.456
And Lex baby is the only one
who knows where he is.

01:28:47.656 --> 01:28:50.096
What... Do you want?

01:28:50.416 --> 01:28:51.776
<i>Well, General...</i>

01:28:52.776 --> 01:28:54.696
The world is a big place.

01:28:55.416 --> 01:28:57.216
Thank goodness...

01:28:58.056 --> 01:28:59.736
...my needs are small.

01:29:01.456 --> 01:29:06.896
As it turns out, I have this affinity
for beachfront property.

01:29:09.096 --> 01:29:10.136
What do you want?

01:29:11.696 --> 01:29:12.736
Australia.

01:29:17.576 --> 01:29:18.976
I can't understand it!

01:29:19.256 --> 01:29:22.416
Where is he? He shows up every time
a cat gets stuck in a tree...

01:29:22.536 --> 01:29:25.016
...and now he's decided to pull
a disappearing act?

01:29:25.096 --> 01:29:28.056
- We haven't figured out his game plan.
- Game plan!

01:29:28.536 --> 01:29:32.816
It's fourth down, the two-minute warning
has sounded and the ball is in our territory.

01:29:32.896 --> 01:29:35.896
How brilliant do you have to be? I mean...

01:29:38.456 --> 01:29:41.536
Superman's got something up his sleeve,
that's for sure.

01:29:41.936 --> 01:29:44.936
- We haven't figured it out. Right?
- He'll be here!

01:29:46.016 --> 01:29:48.056
If it's at all possible, he'll be here.

01:29:48.696 --> 01:29:49.456
See?

01:29:49.736 --> 01:29:52.336
And she knows his plays
better than anybody.

01:29:56.216 --> 01:29:58.256
Better than anybody.

01:29:58.776 --> 01:30:01.176
Maybe he hasn't heard about it yet.

01:30:10.096 --> 01:30:11.496
Sounds like an earthquake.

01:30:55.416 --> 01:30:57.136
Quick, take a picture!

01:31:24.936 --> 01:31:26.656
You all right, chief?

01:31:27.256 --> 01:31:31.016
Even with accumulated knowledge when'll
these dummies learn to use a doorknob?

01:31:31.736 --> 01:31:32.736
Hi!

01:31:35.256 --> 01:31:37.896
You should see the White House,
months of cleaning.

01:31:39.456 --> 01:31:41.296
You promised me the son of Jor-El.

01:31:44.176 --> 01:31:45.256
Yes, your Grace.

01:31:45.976 --> 01:31:46.936
But...

01:31:47.176 --> 01:31:49.456
...what I've given you
is the next best thing.

01:31:49.496 --> 01:31:50.936
Hold on to that little lady...

01:31:51.016 --> 01:31:52.696
...and he'll be along.

01:31:53.616 --> 01:31:55.336
They have this relationship.

01:31:55.496 --> 01:31:59.296
She does all his public relations
and he gives her every exclusive.

01:31:59.656 --> 01:32:02.376
They're the best of friends.
Know what I mean?

01:32:02.976 --> 01:32:06.056
What an undemanding male
this Superman must be.

01:32:06.256 --> 01:32:08.336
You could use a tuck here and there.

01:32:08.976 --> 01:32:09.776
Wait!

01:32:10.656 --> 01:32:12.496
- I'm sorry!
- She lives for now.

01:32:13.216 --> 01:32:14.376
Kill the rest...

01:32:14.816 --> 01:32:15.776
...starting with him.

01:32:17.256 --> 01:32:18.816
Wait. Wait.

01:32:19.456 --> 01:32:21.496
Remember the White House?
The Oval Room?

01:32:21.816 --> 01:32:23.256
We had a few laughs, right?

01:32:41.976 --> 01:32:43.016
General...

01:32:44.496 --> 01:32:46.296
...would you care to step outside?

01:32:46.696 --> 01:32:47.896
Superman!

01:32:48.816 --> 01:32:50.016
Superman, thank God.

01:32:50.976 --> 01:32:52.336
I mean, get him!

01:32:53.016 --> 01:32:55.376
Come to me, Son of Jor-El!

01:32:55.656 --> 01:32:57.976
Kneel before Zod!

01:33:17.776 --> 01:33:19.776
Watch out. You all right?

01:33:29.536 --> 01:33:30.896
Wait there.

01:33:41.216 --> 01:33:42.576
Son of Jor-El!

01:33:43.376 --> 01:33:45.736
We were beginning to think
you were a coward!

01:33:46.216 --> 01:33:47.416
I'm not a coward.

01:33:48.896 --> 01:33:50.536
Let him prove it!

01:34:09.776 --> 01:34:12.296
Then die as you deserve to!

01:34:22.576 --> 01:34:24.776
Come on, get him!

01:34:25.136 --> 01:34:27.136
This is going to be good!

01:34:32.056 --> 01:34:34.216
Take him. He's yours.

01:35:01.576 --> 01:35:03.576
Come on! Kill him!

01:35:04.216 --> 01:35:05.616
<i>Superman...</i>

01:35:14.336 --> 01:35:17.136
The big one's just as strong as Superman!

01:35:49.296 --> 01:35:50.056
Hold him.

01:35:52.936 --> 01:35:54.616
Home run!

01:36:43.296 --> 01:36:47.016
This "super" man is nothing of the kind.

01:36:47.536 --> 01:36:49.656
I've discovered his weakness.

01:36:50.336 --> 01:36:51.376
He cares.

01:36:51.896 --> 01:36:54.856
He actually cares for these Earth people.

01:36:55.296 --> 01:36:58.096
- Like pets?
- I suppose so.

01:36:58.976 --> 01:37:00.856
Sentimental idiot.

01:37:06.376 --> 01:37:07.896
He's caged Non.

01:37:09.376 --> 01:37:11.176
I'll draw his fire.

01:37:11.376 --> 01:37:13.216
With some of my own.

01:37:48.896 --> 01:37:51.296
Get out of here! The rig's going to blow!

01:39:41.496 --> 01:39:43.536
Superman, help us!

01:40:44.696 --> 01:40:47.136
I never thought this thing
would go the distance.

01:40:49.296 --> 01:40:50.856
You people, get back.

01:40:51.296 --> 01:40:53.216
Here, take the end of this.

01:41:07.256 --> 01:41:09.216
No. Don't do it!

01:41:09.936 --> 01:41:11.336
The people!

01:41:51.456 --> 01:41:53.256
Where's you wife, sir?

01:41:53.336 --> 01:41:55.536
I got her. Don't worry.

01:41:55.696 --> 01:41:56.856
He's dead.

01:41:58.656 --> 01:41:59.936
Superman is dead.

01:42:02.336 --> 01:42:03.656
They killed Superman.

01:42:07.096 --> 01:42:08.136
Let's get them!

01:42:08.496 --> 01:42:10.576
Come on, let's go!

01:42:45.816 --> 01:42:47.256
Forgot your change!

01:42:50.776 --> 01:42:52.256
Wait a minute!

01:42:56.976 --> 01:42:58.696
I'm holding it, I'm holding it!

01:43:00.736 --> 01:43:02.336
I can't see what's happening!

01:43:08.096 --> 01:43:09.696
- My hair!
- What about mine?

01:43:10.576 --> 01:43:11.336
Hold on!

01:44:34.736 --> 01:44:35.616
He's alive!

01:44:55.496 --> 01:44:57.456
Come back, please!

01:45:01.376 --> 01:45:02.176
So...

01:45:02.936 --> 01:45:05.416
...he is a coward after all.

01:45:07.936 --> 01:45:09.416
Come back, Superman!

01:45:17.216 --> 01:45:19.896
- Don't leave us!
- We can't handle it without you.

01:45:20.336 --> 01:45:23.336
- It's not our fault.
- He chickened out.

01:45:24.456 --> 01:45:25.336
Phony!

01:45:26.656 --> 01:45:28.536
Superman didn't even do nothing!

01:45:29.056 --> 01:45:30.736
Come on, let's go!

01:45:32.616 --> 01:45:34.176
Get away from here!

01:45:39.376 --> 01:45:40.856
Our victory is complete!

01:45:41.416 --> 01:45:42.936
The son of Jor-El has fled.

01:45:43.256 --> 01:45:44.416
Superman fled?

01:45:45.016 --> 01:45:46.256
I don't believe you.

01:45:46.496 --> 01:45:48.896
- The next time we will kill him!
- The next time?

01:45:50.616 --> 01:45:52.096
The next time?

01:45:53.336 --> 01:45:55.336
What am I going to do with you people?

01:45:55.816 --> 01:45:58.216
I held up my end, I delivered the Blue Boy.

01:45:58.576 --> 01:46:00.456
What do I get from my triple threat?

01:46:00.576 --> 01:46:03.736
"Bow, yield, kneel," that kind of stuff
closes out a town.

01:46:04.176 --> 01:46:08.136
Why do you say this to me
when you know I will kill you for it?

01:46:08.496 --> 01:46:11.536
Kill me? Lex Luthor?

01:46:12.736 --> 01:46:15.576
Extinguish the greatest
criminaI flame of our age?

01:46:15.776 --> 01:46:18.376
- Eradicate the only man on earth with...
- Kill him!

01:46:19.216 --> 01:46:20.696
Superman's address?

01:46:23.416 --> 01:46:24.896
Come!

01:46:25.416 --> 01:46:28.416
The three of us will crush...

01:46:28.656 --> 01:46:30.656
...the son of our jailer.

01:46:30.736 --> 01:46:33.176
Why not increase his handicap?

01:46:33.816 --> 01:46:36.536
Since he cares so much
for these Earth creatures...

01:46:36.976 --> 01:46:39.096
...let us take his favorite.

01:47:33.656 --> 01:47:35.296
Ever heard of parachutes?

01:47:40.656 --> 01:47:42.576
Another small step for mankind.

01:47:44.176 --> 01:47:45.376
Scruffy.

01:47:46.776 --> 01:47:48.256
So morbid.

01:47:48.936 --> 01:47:52.216
A sentimental replica
of a planet long since vanished.

01:47:53.656 --> 01:47:56.056
- No style at all.
- I expect...

01:47:56.856 --> 01:47:58.696
...better manners from my guests.

01:48:14.496 --> 01:48:16.136
We must combine our strength.

01:48:40.576 --> 01:48:41.936
Fools!

01:48:42.456 --> 01:48:43.576
Take him!

01:49:18.016 --> 01:49:20.856
We played this game at school.
Never was very good at it.

01:49:22.656 --> 01:49:24.856
Superman, I knew that you'd...

01:49:29.416 --> 01:49:31.016
Wrong again!

01:49:34.256 --> 01:49:36.056
No, no!

01:49:36.856 --> 01:49:38.016
Release the General...

01:49:38.176 --> 01:49:40.056
...or we'll tear her apart.

01:49:40.096 --> 01:49:41.136
Superman, no!

01:49:42.856 --> 01:49:44.056
Superman, don't!

01:49:45.256 --> 01:49:45.976
All right!

01:49:58.096 --> 01:50:01.136
Did you really think
we would give up our advantage?

01:50:01.496 --> 01:50:02.576
Now...

01:50:02.976 --> 01:50:05.216
...the son of Jor-El will be my slave.

01:50:05.536 --> 01:50:06.256
Forever.

01:50:07.016 --> 01:50:10.016
If not,
the millions of earthlings you protect...

01:50:10.496 --> 01:50:12.616
...will pay for your defiance.

01:50:13.096 --> 01:50:14.856
Destroy this place.

01:50:15.056 --> 01:50:18.176
- Hi, guys. Sorry I'm late.
- We have no more use for this one.

01:50:18.536 --> 01:50:19.336
Kill him.

01:50:19.776 --> 01:50:20.856
Me?

01:50:24.776 --> 01:50:27.296
You came to me with nothing,
I gave you Superman.

01:50:27.776 --> 01:50:28.816
Silence!

01:50:29.376 --> 01:50:30.416
<i>Well, look...</i>

01:50:30.816 --> 01:50:32.816
Watch it. Don't touch me!

01:50:35.136 --> 01:50:36.696
Guy's a clod.

01:50:38.536 --> 01:50:40.776
Promises were made, gifts exchanged.

01:50:41.256 --> 01:50:44.376
I got to hand it to you.
You always told the truth.

01:50:44.776 --> 01:50:47.296
A guy always knew
where he stood with you.

01:50:50.056 --> 01:50:53.096
Try to get them all
into this molecule chamber.

01:50:53.936 --> 01:50:57.456
It takes away their powers, see,
and turns them into ordinary...

01:50:57.616 --> 01:51:00.056
<i>...human beings. Now, if you could...</i>

01:51:03.176 --> 01:51:04.656
Don't go in there, it's a trap!

01:51:04.736 --> 01:51:06.216
You poisonous snake!

01:51:06.816 --> 01:51:08.336
That's a molecule chamber.

01:51:08.536 --> 01:51:11.816
It makes people like you
into people like me.

01:51:12.456 --> 01:51:13.896
You've done well.

01:51:16.656 --> 01:51:19.456
The crystal there activates the mechanism.

01:51:20.136 --> 01:51:22.656
Lex Luthor, ruler of Australia.

01:51:23.016 --> 01:51:24.656
Activate the machine!

01:51:27.736 --> 01:51:28.856
Thank you.

01:51:31.776 --> 01:51:33.536
With your permission.

01:52:46.976 --> 01:52:48.016
And now...

01:52:49.016 --> 01:52:50.016
...finally.

01:53:00.576 --> 01:53:02.096
Take my hand...

01:53:03.096 --> 01:53:08.056
...and swear eternal loyalty to Zod.

01:53:47.976 --> 01:53:49.096
He switched it!

01:53:49.576 --> 01:53:53.216
He did it to them!
I mean the lights were on out here...

01:53:53.896 --> 01:53:55.496
...while he was safe in there!

01:53:57.696 --> 01:53:59.256
You know, something?

01:54:00.056 --> 01:54:02.136
You're a real pain in the neck!

01:54:11.696 --> 01:54:13.776
Are you all right?

01:54:14.816 --> 01:54:18.336
I knew you'd double-cross me.
A lying, weasel like you couldn't resist.

01:54:19.896 --> 01:54:23.216
Are you kidding?
I was with you all the time.

01:54:23.936 --> 01:54:25.096
That was beautiful.

01:54:25.176 --> 01:54:27.376
Did you see the way they fell into our trap?

01:54:27.736 --> 01:54:29.616
Too late!

01:54:30.016 --> 01:54:32.616
Look.

01:54:33.456 --> 01:54:34.696
I got a proposition.

01:54:35.456 --> 01:54:38.016
Don't stop me
until you've heard this because...

01:54:38.616 --> 01:54:41.816
...I know I owe you one,
but we're in the north pole, right?

01:54:42.576 --> 01:54:44.256
Let's wipe the slate clean.

01:54:44.456 --> 01:54:48.096
<i>If you give me a ride back,
I promise to turn over a new leaf...</i>

01:54:52.296 --> 01:54:54.776
It looks so beautiful from up here.

01:54:55.736 --> 01:54:58.736
I guess I'll never get to fly
with you again.

01:54:59.536 --> 01:55:01.936
No. Anywhere you want to go.

01:55:02.856 --> 01:55:04.496
You don't have to worry.

01:55:04.936 --> 01:55:07.296
I'll never tell them who you really are.

01:55:07.856 --> 01:55:09.336
I know.

01:55:24.256 --> 01:55:25.856
See you later.

01:55:57.696 --> 01:55:58.896
Hi.

01:56:26.336 --> 01:56:27.496
How did you sleep?

01:56:30.896 --> 01:56:33.616
No. I didn't close my eyes all night.

01:56:39.216 --> 01:56:42.296
- Look...
- I understand.

01:56:44.976 --> 01:56:48.656
I sat up all night listening to
the voices of reason.

01:56:49.736 --> 01:56:52.816
You know how vile it is to hear
the first bird of the morning...

01:56:52.896 --> 01:56:54.936
...when you've been crying all night?

01:56:55.056 --> 01:56:55.856
I'm sorry.

01:56:56.856 --> 01:56:58.256
I'm sorry, too.

01:56:59.456 --> 01:57:03.736
I guess it's sort of like being
married to a doctor, you know.

01:57:04.296 --> 01:57:06.216
The doctor's awakened at night...

01:57:06.296 --> 01:57:09.416
...and the wife has to cope with the fact
that he's gone.

01:57:10.656 --> 01:57:12.256
I guess I'm just too selfish.

01:57:13.256 --> 01:57:15.136
No. You're not selfish at all.

01:57:15.696 --> 01:57:17.696
I am selfish, when it comes to you.

01:57:17.896 --> 01:57:19.376
I am selfish.

01:57:20.056 --> 01:57:22.616
I'm jealous of the whole world.

01:57:27.296 --> 01:57:31.696
It may not be easy for you
to hear this now, but someday you'll...

01:57:36.136 --> 01:57:38.616
Don't tell me that I'll meet somebody.

01:57:39.816 --> 01:57:43.176
You're kind of a tough act to follow,
you know?

01:57:47.416 --> 01:57:50.296
I'm going to be fine,
you don't have to worry about me.

01:57:55.296 --> 01:57:57.336
I like worrying about you.

01:57:58.976 --> 01:58:00.656
Would you stop?

01:58:01.496 --> 01:58:04.176
Don't you know that this is killing me?

01:58:04.776 --> 01:58:08.616
Do you know what it's like
to have you come in here every morning...

01:58:08.736 --> 01:58:11.176
...and not be able to talk to you?

01:58:11.936 --> 01:58:15.256
Not be able to show
I have any feelings for you?

01:58:15.776 --> 01:58:19.056
Not be able to tell anyone
that I know who you are.

01:58:19.616 --> 01:58:22.136
I don't even know what to call you.

01:58:26.256 --> 01:58:28.256
I don't know what to say.

01:58:31.696 --> 01:58:34.296
I don't know. Say that you love me.

01:59:22.736 --> 01:59:25.176
Gee, are you okay? What happened?

01:59:25.496 --> 01:59:28.176
- You all right?
- I just got so dizzy.

01:59:29.896 --> 01:59:32.816
That's what happens
when I don't have my orange juice.

01:59:33.616 --> 01:59:36.296
- I'm fine.
- Breathe.

01:59:36.376 --> 01:59:39.736
- I'm breathing, for heaven's sake.
- Good for you. Good.

01:59:40.136 --> 01:59:42.056
- God.
- Just drink.

01:59:42.456 --> 01:59:45.056
- Okay.
- Just sip it. Sip it. Sip it.

01:59:45.136 --> 01:59:46.416
I'm fine.

01:59:49.376 --> 01:59:51.216
What was I talking about before?

01:59:51.456 --> 01:59:53.936
If I know you,
it was probably about Superman.

01:59:54.496 --> 01:59:55.736
Him again?

01:59:55.856 --> 02:00:00.576
You've got to stop being threatened
every time the guy's name's mentioned.

02:00:00.616 --> 02:00:03.536
I mean, nobody expects you to be
anything but what you are.

02:00:03.616 --> 02:00:05.016
I'll try to remember that.

02:00:05.096 --> 02:00:07.816
You better remember that.
I appreciate you.

02:00:07.896 --> 02:00:09.616
- You do?
- Sure.

02:00:09.976 --> 02:00:12.176
Especially if you get me a hamburger.

02:00:12.696 --> 02:00:16.056
<i>A hamburger. At 9:00 a. M.?</i>

02:00:16.496 --> 02:00:18.256
Yeah, and everything on it, okay?

02:00:18.336 --> 02:00:19.936
Everything on it.

02:00:20.976 --> 02:00:24.096
- And...
- Orange juice. Freshly squeezed.

02:00:25.056 --> 02:00:26.816
Isn't he a nice guy?

02:00:27.856 --> 02:00:31.056
Let's see what trouble I can get into today.

02:00:35.216 --> 02:00:36.816
What's happening in the world?

02:00:55.416 --> 02:00:57.376
Give me another plate of this garbage.

02:00:57.576 --> 02:01:00.536
Garbage? That's my number one special!

02:01:00.616 --> 02:01:03.856
All right!
Get me some more coffee too, will you?

02:01:05.496 --> 02:01:09.296
Gee, that's funny.
I've never seen garbage eat garbage before.

02:01:17.896 --> 02:01:20.816
Excuse me, sir.
I think you're sitting in my favorite seat.

02:01:21.616 --> 02:01:23.096
Come and get it, four-eyes.

02:01:27.936 --> 02:01:29.016
Now cool it!

02:01:30.896 --> 02:01:31.896
Take it easy.

02:01:31.976 --> 02:01:34.656
I just had this joint fixed.
It cost me a fortune.

02:01:53.016 --> 02:01:54.016
God!

02:02:06.016 --> 02:02:07.736
This order's to go.

02:02:15.896 --> 02:02:18.896
I'm terribly sorry
about all the damage, sir.

02:02:22.136 --> 02:02:23.456
I've been...

02:02:24.136 --> 02:02:25.656
...working out.

02:02:49.736 --> 02:02:51.576
Good afternoon, Mr. President.

02:02:51.856 --> 02:02:53.696
Sorry I've been away so long.

02:02:55.096 --> 02:02:57.216
I won't let you down again.
