00:40.641 --> 00:45.811
<i>Every possession by
a demon occurs during three stages.</i>

00:45.813 --> 00:49.248
<i>The first is called
the Presence.</i>

00:49.250 --> 00:55.687
<i>This is when a demon or entity begins
to make its presence known to the host.</i>

00:55.689 --> 00:58.724
<i>The second stage
is called the Affliction,</i>

00:59.593 --> 01:05.431
<i>when the entity begins to possess
and inhabit the body of its host.</i>

01:05.433 --> 01:10.102
<i>Taking over all control of their physical,
mental and spiritual ability.</i>

01:11.138 --> 01:18.138
<i>The infected begins to feel dirty,
like a pungent force taking over.</i>

01:21.148 --> 01:27.186
<i>But the demon cannot fully infect and
take over a person until the third stage.</i>

01:29.590 --> 01:33.459
<i>It's when the person has finally
surrendered and consents to the demon</i>

01:33.461 --> 01:36.128
<i>as being a part of their soul.</i>

01:37.465 --> 01:40.699
<i>Which is known as the Assent.</i>

02:55.543 --> 02:57.709
<i>Now, go, go! Do it, do it!</i>

03:14.962 --> 03:20.899
Two hundred miles of interstate
and not a goddamn car in sight.

03:20.901 --> 03:23.769
Why do they build roads
if no one's gonna use 'em?

03:23.771 --> 03:25.571
Hi, Rhonda.

03:25.573 --> 03:27.739
And don't you be
paintin' on my time!

03:27.741 --> 03:28.741
I'm not.

03:28.742 --> 03:29.942
It's a sculpture.

03:29.944 --> 03:32.744
Painting, sculpture...
same damn thing.

03:32.746 --> 03:34.379
Still my dime!

03:39.486 --> 03:41.320
Here. Forty bucks.

03:41.322 --> 03:42.754
Now scoot!

03:44.225 --> 03:45.891
For the whole day?

03:45.893 --> 03:48.493
You see any goddamn
customers here?

03:50.864 --> 03:52.264
Thanks, Rhonda.

03:53.734 --> 03:54.900
So, tomorrow?

03:54.902 --> 03:57.636
Ten o'clock! I'm gonna sleep in.

03:57.638 --> 04:01.406
I should, uh, probably get home.
Mason's with a babysitter.

04:01.408 --> 04:03.909
And clean up your
shit before you go!

04:20.027 --> 04:21.726
Hey, pal.

04:21.728 --> 04:23.962
Daddy, Daddy! Look, I can fly!

04:23.964 --> 04:26.999
Yeah, I can see! Be careful, though.
We don't want you flyin' away.

04:27.868 --> 04:30.602
Aww!

04:30.604 --> 04:33.205
Did you get me anything?

04:33.206 --> 04:36.286
From work? Uh, no. But I can make you
somethin', if you want. What do you want?

04:37.711 --> 04:39.845
What do you want?
Tell me what you want.

04:42.783 --> 04:44.983
Cassie! I'm home!

04:45.886 --> 04:47.486
Hey, Mr. Clarke. How was work?

04:47.488 --> 04:48.854
Yeah, well, it was good.

04:48.856 --> 04:51.423
Now, play with your toys
while I talk to Cassie. Okay?

04:51.425 --> 04:52.425
Okay.

04:54.395 --> 04:57.863
Alright, listen. What did I tell you about
lettin' him play outside on his own?

04:57.865 --> 05:00.032
Oh, he's fine!
He's a big boy now.

05:00.034 --> 05:04.036
He's a smart kid, and he's
perfectly fine being left alone.

05:04.038 --> 05:07.739
I'm his dad. I just don't...
I think I know what's best for him.

05:07.741 --> 05:08.741
Okay.

05:09.777 --> 05:12.544
Uh, okay, how much do I...

05:12.546 --> 05:15.314
Uh, $40 for the sitting
and $8 for the groceries.

05:17.384 --> 05:18.517
Groceries are $8?

05:18.519 --> 05:20.319
Single portion for
Mason, like always.

05:20.321 --> 05:22.654
But it was spaghetti and
meatballs tonight, so...

05:22.656 --> 05:24.523
Look, I've probably got
some more money upstairs.

05:24.525 --> 05:26.258
Uh, Mr. Clarke,
don't. It's fine.

05:26.259 --> 05:27.992
- Don't worry about it.
- No, no-no-no-no. I can't let you do that.

05:27.993 --> 05:29.726
Consider it my treat, okay?

05:29.730 --> 05:31.496
- Thank you, Cassie.
- Of course.

05:32.633 --> 05:35.734
Before you go, uh, I
need you to, um, do the...

05:36.704 --> 05:37.803
thing.

05:38.672 --> 05:39.905
Uh...

05:45.579 --> 05:46.978
- Need you to...
- Oh, yeah.

05:49.450 --> 05:51.817
- Thank you.
- Okay. Of course, Mr. Clarke.

05:51.819 --> 05:55.520
Don't let the food
get cold. Okay?

05:55.522 --> 05:58.990
Bye, Mason. I'll see
you next time. Okay?

05:58.992 --> 06:00.625
Alright, pal, let's
get washed up.

06:00.627 --> 06:02.094
Now your girlfriend's gone...

06:04.798 --> 06:08.500
Thank you, Lord, for this
meal we're about to eat.

06:08.502 --> 06:11.403
Bless this food through
Christ our Lord.

06:11.405 --> 06:12.504
Amen.

06:15.075 --> 06:16.075
What was that?

06:16.076 --> 06:18.110
It's a prayer!

06:18.112 --> 06:21.079
Cassie taught me how
to pray before you eat.

06:21.081 --> 06:24.516
She said, God gave us food
and we must thank him.

06:24.518 --> 06:27.018
I'm the one who puts
the food on the table, pal.

06:27.020 --> 06:30.856
- So do I have to pray to you?
- No.

06:30.858 --> 06:32.291
I'm your dad.

06:32.292 --> 06:33.732
I take care of you.
That's what I do.

06:35.028 --> 06:36.828
Daddy, what are you making?

06:38.031 --> 06:39.798
I don't know.

06:39.800 --> 06:42.785
That's the thing about art, pal.

06:42.786 --> 06:45.771
Sometimes it comes to you much later,
and you just keep tinkering 'til it does.

06:45.773 --> 06:47.939
Can I be an artist one day?

06:47.941 --> 06:50.142
If you want. You can be
whatever you want to be.

06:50.144 --> 06:51.743
But you have to eat
your dinner first.

06:51.745 --> 06:55.747
- Aren't you going to eat?
- Yes. After you.

06:56.617 --> 06:59.918
But you need to eat if you're
gonna grow up all big and strong.

06:59.920 --> 07:03.088
Well, you have to eat your dinner
if you are gonna be big and strong.

07:03.090 --> 07:04.856
I'm already big and strong.

07:04.858 --> 07:06.992
Yes, I am already
big and strong!

07:06.994 --> 07:11.129
If you want to be strong like me,
you have to eat that dinner.

07:11.131 --> 07:13.598
So, eat your meatballs!

07:13.600 --> 07:17.702
Where are those muscles?! Where
are those muscles? Come on!

07:17.704 --> 07:23.542
Aah-aah! No, not Mason! The
meanest man in town! Ow...

07:23.544 --> 07:25.110
He's so big!

07:38.525 --> 07:40.992
Good night, pal. I love you.

07:41.929 --> 07:44.129
- I love you too, Dad.
- Hmm.

07:44.131 --> 07:46.231
<i>Whooo! My name is Camper.</i>

07:46.233 --> 07:48.099
And I love you too, Camper.

07:49.102 --> 07:51.203
Camper loves you too.

08:00.514 --> 08:01.947
And I miss you.

09:39.079 --> 09:41.046
<i>Who are you?</i>

10:22.856 --> 10:26.925
<i>Who are you? My name is Camper.</i>

10:27.761 --> 10:30.028
<i>Will you be my friend?</i>

10:36.236 --> 10:37.702
Here, kitty-kitty.

10:43.877 --> 10:45.343
Good cat.

11:01.294 --> 11:04.229
<i>We're talking
about schizophrenia here, folks.</i>

11:04.231 --> 11:06.698
<i>Seeing things, hallucinations!</i>

11:06.700 --> 11:08.299
<i>That's what the
prison records say.</i>

11:08.301 --> 11:11.670
<i>But yet Father Lambert
Bowman is released today,</i>

11:11.672 --> 11:14.873
<i>only three years from the death
of five-year-old Edward Martin.</i>

11:14.875 --> 11:19.144
<i>It's not just a case of a failed
exorcism, it's negligence.</i>

11:19.146 --> 11:20.845
<i>Freedom of religion.</i>

11:20.847 --> 11:22.847
<i>Where are we,
in the Dark Ages?</i>

11:22.849 --> 11:25.750
<i>I say persecute him
like everybody else.</i>

11:38.365 --> 11:39.964
Father Lambert!

11:42.135 --> 11:44.302
Father Lambert, are you
taking any interviews?

11:59.753 --> 12:01.186
<i>Freedom of religion.</i>

12:01.188 --> 12:03.221
<i>Where are we,
in the Dark Ages?</i>

12:03.223 --> 12:06.124
<i>I say persecute him
like everybody else.</i>

12:06.126 --> 12:10.495
<i>Like in prison. Just because you're a priest,
it doesn't give you a free pass</i>

12:10.497 --> 12:14.032
<i>- to kill someone and ruin the lives of the Martin family.
-</i> Drive.

12:14.034 --> 12:18.803
<i>Am I right? Let's open up and rise.
What do you think of this whole debacle?</i>

12:18.805 --> 12:20.905
<i>Well, I think Father
Lambert should be persecuted,</i>

12:20.907 --> 12:22.941
<i>just like any other
citizen would.</i>

12:22.942 --> 12:25.662
<i>- If he was doing his job, he would've called...</i>
- Turn that thing off!

12:26.413 --> 12:27.746
So...

12:29.416 --> 12:30.749
Are we all set?

12:30.751 --> 12:32.317
Down to the last detail.

12:32.319 --> 12:34.886
The Congregation for
the Doctrine of the Faith

12:34.888 --> 12:38.256
issued an indefinite suspension
of your clerical duties.

12:38.258 --> 12:41.226
Typical.

12:41.227 --> 12:44.195
With the public uproar,
distancing yourself is probably the wisest?

12:44.197 --> 12:46.030
Have you heard
from the Martin family?

12:48.902 --> 12:52.403
Involuntary restraining order
against you from the State.

12:52.405 --> 12:54.139
Hmh!

12:54.141 --> 12:55.907
I got everything you asked for.

12:56.810 --> 12:58.777
But this is dangerous
if the Diocese finds out.

12:58.779 --> 13:00.979
Even though it
is not your fault.

13:02.082 --> 13:04.182
It's not fault.

13:04.184 --> 13:05.350
I feel.

13:13.326 --> 13:16.094
Have you still
been seeing these things?

13:16.096 --> 13:19.197
The figures you were
telling me about last time?

13:21.935 --> 13:23.568
Joel?

13:23.570 --> 13:24.903
Sorry.

13:24.905 --> 13:26.538
Um...

13:26.540 --> 13:29.474
Still have them sometimes.
It's been better since the medication.

13:30.443 --> 13:33.111
Plus, see I uh... I
found a new way...

13:35.048 --> 13:37.315
- New way?
- Yeah. This is, uh...

13:37.317 --> 13:39.083
it's my boss's old camera.

13:39.085 --> 13:40.952
I've been borrowing
it, and when I...

13:42.088 --> 13:43.922
see something I'm
not sure is real, I...

13:46.326 --> 13:48.493
Picture helps me
tell the difference.

13:48.495 --> 13:50.461
That's a creative way
to combat schizophrenia.

13:51.531 --> 13:55.834
It's important we learn to identify
what is real and what isn't.

13:57.304 --> 13:59.904
This'll look good on
your custody report.

13:59.906 --> 14:02.507
Now... do you have
something for me?

14:05.979 --> 14:07.579
I have receipts.

14:07.581 --> 14:09.447
Days she worked,
proof of payment.

14:15.856 --> 14:18.540
Very good.

14:18.541 --> 14:21.225
This is our proof to the A.S.F.A. of
your ability to take care of your son.

14:21.228 --> 14:24.295
Plus, your cooperation
with the medication.

14:24.297 --> 14:26.130
And how's the job
hunting coming along?

14:27.400 --> 14:29.033
I'm still at Rhonda's.

14:31.037 --> 14:32.270
Joel...

14:34.541 --> 14:36.875
Rhonda's isn't a job.

14:36.877 --> 14:40.545
You're not getting benefits,
and you're paid below minimum wage.

14:41.448 --> 14:43.732
I'm managing fine.

14:43.733 --> 14:46.017
The house is paid for by Mason's
mum before she died. I'm...

14:46.019 --> 14:47.118
You're living day-to-day.

14:47.120 --> 14:51.556
You need to start planning and
thinking more about the future.

14:52.926 --> 14:54.058
Longer terms.

14:54.961 --> 14:56.895
- We talked about this.
- I know, I know.

15:01.935 --> 15:04.202
This is how people
take advantage of you.

15:05.305 --> 15:10.675
You need to learn to start making
better choices for yourself.

15:25.025 --> 15:28.059
Uh, please, uh, come in.
Uh... make yourself at home.

15:28.061 --> 15:29.360
Did
you bring the tapes?

15:29.362 --> 15:30.662
Oh! Yeah.

15:35.568 --> 15:40.305
Um, I haven't had a chance
to organize them all, bu...

15:40.307 --> 15:41.639
Let's get started.

15:43.143 --> 15:44.943
It's gonna be a long night.

15:51.518 --> 15:54.585
Mason! Time for dinner!

15:57.991 --> 15:59.057
Mason!

16:01.127 --> 16:04.162
My daddy
will be here any minute.

16:10.270 --> 16:11.970
He's waiting downstairs.

16:14.140 --> 16:15.273
Mason?

16:16.343 --> 16:18.409
I'm going to sleep soon.

16:18.411 --> 16:20.578
No, I can't play.

16:20.580 --> 16:22.580
No, I can't play.

16:22.582 --> 16:25.416
Why don't you come back later?

16:25.418 --> 16:27.318
He won't be angry.

16:29.356 --> 16:32.290
Shhh! Don't make him angry.

17:11.631 --> 17:13.397
He's waiting there.

17:15.667 --> 17:17.402
Who's waiting there, buddy?

17:18.371 --> 17:22.240
The man that looks like a
goat and walks like a dog.

17:37.290 --> 17:38.689
Hey!

17:38.691 --> 17:41.092
Your money's on the table.

17:41.094 --> 17:45.663
Finish up in the front, and uh, don't
forget to lock the door on your way out!

17:45.665 --> 17:48.099
Thanks, Rhonda.

18:28.141 --> 18:29.357
<i>Hello?</i>

18:29.358 --> 18:31.118
Doctor Maya, I uh, I
have a question for you.

18:31.511 --> 18:33.711
<i>- Joel?</i>
- Yeah, is schizophrenia hereditary?

18:34.714 --> 18:36.230
<i>Joel.</i>

18:36.231 --> 18:37.747
<i>- Please make an appointment if you have any questions.</i>
- I know, I know.

18:37.750 --> 18:40.318
It's just, um,
just one question.

18:40.320 --> 18:42.487
It's, it's important.

18:43.623 --> 18:44.822
Please.

18:47.794 --> 18:51.496
<i>It's hard to say, Joel.
Schizophrenia does have a genetic compound.</i>

18:51.498 --> 18:53.397
<i>Is this about Mason?</i>

18:54.801 --> 18:55.900
No.

19:09.716 --> 19:13.651
- Daddy, Daddy!
- Hey! Ahhh, there he is! Hey, look at me.

19:13.653 --> 19:15.653
Look at me.

19:15.655 --> 19:17.288
- I just wanna see...
- Daddy, stop!

19:17.290 --> 19:18.222
Okay.

19:18.224 --> 19:19.624
Okay.

19:19.626 --> 19:20.758
Where's your girlfriend?

19:22.395 --> 19:23.928
That smells amazing.
What is it?

19:25.899 --> 19:28.166
Uh, roast chicken.

19:29.402 --> 19:33.671
I decided today that we're going
to actually eat a proper meal.

19:33.673 --> 19:35.189
All of us.

19:35.190 --> 19:36.706
Cassie, I told you
single portions.

19:36.709 --> 19:37.675
This one's on me.

19:37.677 --> 19:39.477
Just give me the
$40 for the day.

19:48.955 --> 19:53.558
Mr. Clarke, I have something
I need to talk to you about.

19:56.729 --> 19:59.714
Yeah?

19:59.715 --> 20:02.700
I, I got accepted
into a university.

20:02.702 --> 20:04.902
On, on full scholarship.

20:04.904 --> 20:07.271
That's great! Which one?

20:08.241 --> 20:09.340
Vanderton?

20:12.345 --> 20:13.611
In Philadelphia.

20:13.612 --> 20:15.252
I'm gonna get my degree
for, for teaching.

20:15.748 --> 20:16.881
Philadelphia?

20:17.917 --> 20:18.749
That means...

20:18.751 --> 20:21.285
I can't babysit anymore.

20:21.287 --> 20:24.872
- Cassie!
- I'm sorry, Mr. Clarke.

20:24.873 --> 20:28.458
I'm... you knew that I was waiting on an acceptance,
and that I took this job in the meantime.

20:28.461 --> 20:32.230
I can't find another babysitter.
I-I-I don't make enough.

20:32.232 --> 20:34.699
I figured we'd keep doing this,
until I-I find a better job.

20:34.701 --> 20:36.834
I-I can't keep doing
this forever, too.

20:36.836 --> 20:40.571
I mean, you know I've always
wanted to go to college.

20:40.573 --> 20:45.509
If I don't have a babysitter, or a real
income, the state's gonna take Mason away.

20:48.681 --> 20:49.814
When do you leave?

20:50.917 --> 20:52.250
In a few days.

20:52.252 --> 20:58.656
It's a new town and all, so even though school
doesn't start for a couple of months, I need time

20:58.658 --> 21:00.524
to settle in and...

21:00.526 --> 21:01.692
So, your last day?

21:02.629 --> 21:03.629
Today.

21:05.398 --> 21:09.834
It's the weekend, so you'll
be with him anyway. Right?

21:13.039 --> 21:14.405
This is so sudden.

21:14.407 --> 21:15.473
I'm so sorry.

21:15.475 --> 21:16.941
No, you're not!

21:16.943 --> 21:18.676
You don't get to say that!

21:18.678 --> 21:24.282
You're just like everybody else. You leave as
soon as soon as something better comes along.

21:24.951 --> 21:27.818
You act like you care,
but you don't care.

21:27.820 --> 21:31.289
- You don't...
- Yeah, you don't care!

21:33.926 --> 21:35.860
Never should have trusted you.

21:35.861 --> 21:38.261
Why don't you go upstairs to
play, and I'll come and get you.

22:34.420 --> 22:35.820
Kitty!

22:39.926 --> 22:42.693
Kitty?

22:51.637 --> 22:52.670
Weird.

23:06.953 --> 23:08.552
Last one.

23:15.661 --> 23:16.961
Let me see it.

23:37.083 --> 23:39.650
<i>In manuum figuli?</i>

23:40.887 --> 23:42.887
Are you familiar
with those words?

23:43.723 --> 23:48.559
Not in any, uh, religious text.

23:48.561 --> 23:50.161
You think it means something?

23:50.163 --> 23:52.663
I think it's the lead
to our next victim.

23:54.133 --> 23:57.134
You know demons leave
traces of their hunger.

23:58.204 --> 24:00.171
Do we have any
grammar resources?

24:01.107 --> 24:03.507
In the next room, top shelf.

24:12.051 --> 24:15.085
Daddy! Can you come
play with me tonight?

24:15.087 --> 24:16.487
Yeah, give me a minute.

24:33.473 --> 24:34.638
Mason?

24:35.541 --> 24:37.107
Did you do this?

24:38.478 --> 24:40.144
He keeps moving it.

24:41.547 --> 24:42.547
Who does?

24:43.483 --> 24:45.683
The man with ugly faces.

24:54.093 --> 24:55.593
There's nothing there, pal.

24:56.863 --> 24:58.095
He's in there.

25:03.035 --> 25:06.070
Mason, do you know what this is?

25:07.673 --> 25:10.324
This is a camera.

25:10.325 --> 25:12.976
And what it does is it shows
us what's really there.

25:13.946 --> 25:17.248
So, we're gonna take a
picture of your cupboard.

25:17.250 --> 25:20.284
And then it's gonna show us there's
nothing to be afraid of. Okay?

25:21.654 --> 25:24.522
So point the camera.

25:24.524 --> 25:26.023
And then press the button.

25:29.095 --> 25:30.961
There we go.

25:31.864 --> 25:32.997
You see?

25:34.700 --> 25:37.735
No? You wanna do another one?

25:37.737 --> 25:38.737
Go on.

25:38.738 --> 25:39.870
Point.

25:51.684 --> 25:53.617
There we go. Do you see?

25:54.554 --> 25:56.153
Nothing to be scared of.

25:57.056 --> 25:59.323
Can I sleep with you tonight?

26:01.027 --> 26:02.927
Yeah, pal. Of course you can.

26:05.131 --> 26:08.933
Do people who are schizophrenic
see the same things?

26:08.935 --> 26:10.701
Like what?

26:10.703 --> 26:12.002
Dark figures.

26:12.004 --> 26:13.804
Black figures.

26:14.840 --> 26:17.575
Shadows are a thing
that many people see.

26:17.577 --> 26:22.212
Now, if we're talking about hearing
the same words or voices, then it's

26:22.214 --> 26:23.247
a different story.

26:24.183 --> 26:27.435
But highly unlikely.

26:27.436 --> 26:30.688
But if you see these figures,
it means you're schizophrenic, right?

26:30.690 --> 26:33.674
Not necessarily.

26:33.675 --> 26:36.659
Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, dementia,
Charles Bonnet syndrome...

26:36.662 --> 26:38.862
Or even just the
trick of the eye.

26:40.967 --> 26:45.970
Am I missing something? Where are the
babysitter's receipts for yesterday?

26:47.239 --> 26:48.239
She left.

26:49.308 --> 26:50.874
Going to university.

26:51.711 --> 26:53.644
- Still looking for a new one.
- Joel.

26:54.347 --> 26:57.214
Mason needs a babysitter.
You cannot leave him by himself.

26:57.216 --> 26:58.649
I don't.

26:58.651 --> 26:59.817
I'm staying at home with him.

26:59.819 --> 27:01.285
No.

27:01.287 --> 27:03.954
He needs someone who has
a proper tutoring certification.

27:03.956 --> 27:05.889
Or get him into a day
care before kindergarten.

27:05.891 --> 27:08.225
You know I can't afford that.

27:08.227 --> 27:11.362
Look, I will find a new
babysitter. Okay?

27:11.364 --> 27:14.064
She just... she dropped
it on me so suddenly.

27:15.134 --> 27:18.736
I'm sure it won't take long. I
just, I just can't do it today.

27:18.738 --> 27:20.738
You know? I can't do it now.

27:20.740 --> 27:23.674
But Mason's fine. I don't, I
don't take my eyes off him.

27:23.676 --> 27:26.276
Is that why he's waiting
outside in the reception area?

27:27.346 --> 27:29.880
We're going to the
library after this.

27:29.882 --> 27:31.715
He's, uh.

27:31.717 --> 27:33.684
He's already
read all his books.

27:33.686 --> 27:36.253
He's a very smart boy.

27:36.255 --> 27:37.255
Joel...

27:37.256 --> 27:42.693
You're gonna need to find a babysitter
and tutor as fast as possible.

27:42.695 --> 27:44.061
I'm trying.

27:45.765 --> 27:47.931
All I want is what's
best for you.

27:54.874 --> 27:56.073
You have one week.

27:56.075 --> 28:00.778
I'm gonna go by to your house next
week and check up on you over there,

28:00.780 --> 28:02.780
instead of having
our sessions here.

28:05.785 --> 28:06.817
Thanks.

28:09.955 --> 28:12.256
- Daddy!
- Hey, pal! Hey.

28:12.258 --> 28:13.957
Ahh!

28:13.959 --> 28:15.793
Who are you talking to?

28:15.795 --> 28:18.028
Someone who thinks
they can help us.

28:21.934 --> 28:26.003
Dad, could you help me read?
I don't feel like it today.

28:26.005 --> 28:27.905
In a minute, pal.
Just let me finish this.

28:29.141 --> 28:32.176
Why are you painting
the eye blue?

28:32.178 --> 28:33.210
It's a talisman.

28:33.212 --> 28:36.480
Or an even eye!

28:36.482 --> 28:39.817
Ancient Mesopotamians thought
it protected us from bad luck.

28:41.120 --> 28:43.320
Why are you putting
it in Camper?

28:43.322 --> 28:46.123
So that Camper can protect you.

28:46.125 --> 28:48.025
But you protect me.

28:48.027 --> 28:49.359
Mummy too.

28:51.330 --> 28:53.864
Mason, mummy isn't here.

28:53.866 --> 28:55.299
But I see her.

29:00.139 --> 29:04.341
Mummy's in a much
more special place now.

29:05.244 --> 29:07.311
She's right here.

29:07.313 --> 29:08.345
With me.

29:09.749 --> 29:11.315
And I'll never leave you.

29:12.318 --> 29:15.185
'Cause in the end, it's
us against the world.

29:16.255 --> 29:18.122
And...

29:18.124 --> 29:19.490
Camper!

29:20.760 --> 29:23.093
He gets to sleep
with me tonight.

29:23.095 --> 29:24.995
Yes, he does! Like every night.

29:24.997 --> 29:27.264
Oi! Haven't finished
your nuggets.

29:27.266 --> 29:29.667
Oi.

29:29.668 --> 29:32.069
I'm coming to get you!
I'm coming to get you!

29:32.071 --> 29:36.840
And here we gooooo!

29:36.842 --> 29:38.809
And go to bed!
Go to bed, go to bed.

29:41.046 --> 29:44.148
Daddy, can you come
sleep with me tonight?

30:02.067 --> 30:03.433
Mason...

30:03.435 --> 30:04.802
Mason!

30:05.571 --> 30:07.004
Where'd you get this?

30:07.006 --> 30:08.539
Wasn't me, Daddy.

30:08.541 --> 30:11.041
You know you're not supposed
to touch things in Daddy's room.

30:11.043 --> 30:12.576
But I didn't do it.

30:12.578 --> 30:14.244
Promise.

30:24.890 --> 30:27.424
Hi, Father.

30:27.425 --> 30:29.959
Hey, Cassie! What
are you doing here?

30:29.962 --> 30:34.598
Uh, I stopped by your parish, but Susan says
you haven't been around for a few days, and...

30:35.601 --> 30:37.868
I wanted to talk to
you about something.

30:39.271 --> 30:40.604
Sure.

30:40.606 --> 30:41.839
Come in.

30:44.543 --> 30:47.344
- Would you, uh, like some coffee?
- Please.

30:49.014 --> 30:50.614
Uh...

30:50.616 --> 30:51.982
something...

30:53.619 --> 30:56.119
something weird happened.

30:56.121 --> 30:57.387
Last night, with...

30:57.389 --> 31:04.389
Joel, the guy whose son I've been
babysitting for almost two years now.

31:04.463 --> 31:05.929
The mechanic.

31:10.436 --> 31:15.472
I told him I was going to college,
and that I couldn't look after Mason anymore.

31:15.474 --> 31:19.643
And I... I knew he wasn't gonna be happy
about it, but he sort of blew up at me.

31:21.146 --> 31:23.146
Mason did too.

31:26.318 --> 31:28.285
It was like they
were growling at me.

31:29.989 --> 31:31.455
It was dark.

31:31.457 --> 31:32.623
It wasn't...

31:32.625 --> 31:38.061
Normal. I mean, I... I don't even, I don't
even know if I was just hearing things

31:38.063 --> 31:40.530
in the heat of the
moment. Or-or people...

31:40.532 --> 31:44.902
people blow up and... and get angry, right?
But this was different.

31:44.904 --> 31:47.170
I felt something.

31:49.541 --> 31:51.375
Like the room went dark.

31:52.912 --> 31:55.612
I was just spooked out all day.

31:57.516 --> 32:00.584
And as I was walked out,
I sensed something.

32:01.453 --> 32:03.687
You know, in your sermon a
couple weeks ago, you were

32:03.689 --> 32:08.425
talking about how The Devil
makes itself... you know.

32:13.699 --> 32:15.265
Oh.

32:15.267 --> 32:17.434
This is Father Lambert.

32:17.436 --> 32:19.569
The Diocese asked
me to look after him...

32:19.571 --> 32:21.638
Who is this person
that you mentioned?

32:21.640 --> 32:23.140
...for the time being.

32:23.142 --> 32:24.207
Joel.

32:26.345 --> 32:30.681
Joel Clarke is the father,
and Mason is his son.

32:30.683 --> 32:34.952
He's a Brit that married a
local girl, Sarah Howland.

32:34.954 --> 32:36.620
She died in a car crash.

32:36.622 --> 32:39.156
Joel never really moved on.

32:39.158 --> 32:42.693
Since then, he's been socially isolated,
not active in the church...

32:42.695 --> 32:44.962
Not active anywhere.

32:44.964 --> 32:47.965
If he's not at the shop, then
he's at home, making his...

32:49.201 --> 32:50.701
weird sculptures.

32:54.540 --> 32:58.709
Look, the whole thing just sort
of threw me off, okay? It was...

32:59.611 --> 33:04.314
it was scary, and I, I'm
scared for Mason too.

33:05.184 --> 33:06.544
Could you maybe
go check on them...

33:07.453 --> 33:08.285
for me?

33:08.287 --> 33:12.322
Father Lambert and I
will go see him tomorrow.

33:13.492 --> 33:14.758
Thanks, Father.

33:14.760 --> 33:16.994
Do you think...

33:17.763 --> 33:20.497
<i>In manuum figuli.</i>

33:20.499 --> 33:23.100
In the hands of the potter.

33:23.102 --> 33:27.371
He's a sculptor,
creator with his hands.

33:27.373 --> 33:30.107
And he was
Abaddon's last words.

33:53.799 --> 33:55.365
Mommy!

36:55.380 --> 36:57.447
<i>Joel</i>.

37:12.531 --> 37:13.630
Mason?

38:05.550 --> 38:06.550
Mason!

38:27.939 --> 38:31.808
The cosmic Lord of Death
seeks a new battleground.

38:33.545 --> 38:35.945
Abaddon awaits.

38:41.687 --> 38:43.620
Let me handle it
when we get there.

38:44.489 --> 38:46.956
I sense we're getting close.

38:46.958 --> 38:49.592
Close? Like you can feel it?

38:50.996 --> 38:55.465
When one comes close to such
evil, part of the soul withers

38:55.467 --> 38:58.902
from such contact with the
opposite of humanness.

38:58.904 --> 39:02.672
The essence of evil has
attached itself within me.

39:03.742 --> 39:05.342
No rest for the wicked.

39:21.126 --> 39:23.493
Hey. Hey, look...

39:25.964 --> 39:27.497
That creep.

39:27.499 --> 39:29.566
It's that fuckin'
child killer, isn't it?

40:06.104 --> 40:10.640
It's the house, but I
don't see an entrance.

40:13.412 --> 40:14.811
Let's try around back.

40:39.104 --> 40:40.104
Hello!

40:41.473 --> 40:42.705
Anybody home?

40:48.480 --> 40:49.480
Hello!

41:04.463 --> 41:07.864
Hello? Anybody home?

41:09.034 --> 41:10.467
Hello?

41:12.971 --> 41:15.138
Doesn't look like
anybody's here.

41:29.020 --> 41:30.520
It's him! He's hurt.

41:31.756 --> 41:32.789
Do it!

41:50.075 --> 41:53.142
We found the pills
in your pocket.

41:53.144 --> 41:54.277
Ugh!

41:56.982 --> 41:58.702
Who are you? What are
you doin' in my house?

42:00.652 --> 42:01.784
Ugh...

42:02.754 --> 42:03.887
Mason.

42:03.889 --> 42:05.121
Easy now.

42:06.057 --> 42:08.191
You fell down
a flight of stairs.

42:08.193 --> 42:10.159
You're lucky you didn't
break your neck.

42:11.062 --> 42:12.028
Where's my son?

42:12.030 --> 42:14.931
He's fine. He's
upstairs sleeping.

42:14.933 --> 42:17.133
He is still very unresponsive.

42:18.537 --> 42:19.769
But this place is...

42:20.872 --> 42:25.141
like a breeding ground
for negative energies.

42:26.011 --> 42:28.811
- I have to see my son.
- Hey. We're here to help!

42:29.681 --> 42:34.284
"Rejoice in the darkness, ye
shall appear before his horns."

42:34.286 --> 42:35.318
Mason!

42:36.621 --> 42:37.687
Mason...

42:39.257 --> 42:40.223
Mason, come on.

42:40.225 --> 42:41.624
Hey, hey.

42:41.626 --> 42:43.192
Come on now.
Come on. You're okay.

42:43.194 --> 42:46.596
Come on, pal. Mason,
look at me. Mason.

42:46.598 --> 42:48.932
Look at me. Come on,
buddy, you're okay.

42:50.201 --> 42:51.568
What's happening?

42:53.038 --> 42:54.337
Say something!

42:57.175 --> 42:59.008
We have much to talk about.

43:07.285 --> 43:08.985
You've been marked
by him, my son.

43:10.822 --> 43:13.723
We're not dealing with
any ordinary demon here.

43:13.725 --> 43:18.127
Goes by many names,
taking on identities

43:18.129 --> 43:21.631
from myths, fear, legends...

43:21.633 --> 43:23.266
throughout mankind.

43:23.268 --> 43:29.005
It goes by Abaddon,
Mephistopheles, bete noire...

43:29.007 --> 43:33.242
Throughout the world, he's called Lucifer,
Prince of Darkness, Satan himself!

43:33.244 --> 43:37.981
You listen to yourself, you're telling me
that my family has been marked by Satan.

43:39.217 --> 43:41.884
There's only way
to purge this demon.

43:41.886 --> 43:44.187
And that's for you to begin

43:44.189 --> 43:45.922
your faith in our Lord.

43:45.924 --> 43:49.993
To purge? Do you even...
do you even hear what you...

43:51.162 --> 43:54.163
I need my meds.

43:54.164 --> 43:57.165
There are illnesses known to us,
like Parkinson's or dyslexia,

43:57.168 --> 44:00.203
that were mistaken
for possession before.

44:00.205 --> 44:05.942
Science does play an important role, but we
have reasons to believe this is something more.

44:07.946 --> 44:14.384
Remember this: The Devil
makes the sane insane.

44:14.386 --> 44:16.319
And the insane, sane.

44:17.222 --> 44:20.790
He lives so far into the
shadows of modern society,

44:20.792 --> 44:25.328
hidden by the face of science,
that we forget that he even exists.

44:25.330 --> 44:29.032
And in that time, he has gotten
stronger and stronger every day!

44:31.202 --> 44:34.103
We don't see him coming,
because we don't know who he is.

44:35.306 --> 44:41.811
His grip on our souls can be so deep
that the only way out is an exorcism!

44:43.815 --> 44:45.114
An exorcism?

44:46.284 --> 44:48.785
- Exorcis... isn't that just...?
- Highly legal.

44:49.688 --> 44:52.255
First Amendment
protects exorcisms,

44:52.257 --> 44:56.426
for the exercise of religion,
in and of itself, is legal.

44:57.862 --> 45:00.063
Give me 18 hours.

45:00.065 --> 45:01.898
I will banish this demon.

45:04.803 --> 45:06.869
I just need Mason to be fine.

45:06.871 --> 45:08.905
He will be taken care of.

45:08.907 --> 45:12.275
Our associate, Dr. Hawkins,
is on her way now as we speak.

45:12.277 --> 45:16.913
Take the help that is given to you here,
or forever risk damnation.

45:20.118 --> 45:21.184
That's the doctor.

45:25.890 --> 45:28.791
Doctor Hawkins. Please, come in.
We're all upstairs.

45:28.793 --> 45:31.728
Doc Hawkins! So
glad you could join us.

45:33.832 --> 45:37.300
I don't think you're supposed to be here.
Did you get a permission from the Bishop?

45:37.302 --> 45:40.303
You're the only ordained
doctor in the Diocese.

45:40.305 --> 45:42.138
- Hmm.
- Who was I gonna call?

45:47.879 --> 45:49.946
No, I've told you
already, I'm fine.

45:49.948 --> 45:51.881
Go check on my son.

45:51.883 --> 45:53.483
Joel, you're the one that
needs attention right now.

45:53.485 --> 45:55.752
Check on my son.

45:56.521 --> 45:59.222
Okay. But we're gonna have
to come back and look at it.

46:01.893 --> 46:02.959
Follow me.

46:17.075 --> 46:19.842
Well, the good news is that
he's breathing normally.

46:20.879 --> 46:25.148
No broken bones, no signs
of external trauma.

46:26.484 --> 46:29.051
Medically speaking, he's fine.

46:29.053 --> 46:31.888
- Like in a deep sleep.
- Except that he is unresponsive.

46:31.890 --> 46:33.790
Will he wake up?

46:33.792 --> 46:36.092
It is too early to
tell at this point.

46:51.009 --> 46:52.009
What?

46:55.113 --> 46:56.512
I'm hearing voices.

46:57.916 --> 47:00.383
- Latin.
- That is the third sign.

47:00.385 --> 47:02.151
The third sign of what?

47:04.189 --> 47:08.224
Well, there are six classic
signs to possession.

47:08.226 --> 47:12.562
There's aversion to the cross,
rolling of the eyes, what we just witnessed-

47:12.564 --> 47:15.531
speaking in a language that
no one has a knowledge of.

47:15.533 --> 47:18.034
And that's what it takes to
declare someone possessed, is it?

47:18.036 --> 47:22.605
Predicting future events, uh, speaking in
voices, antipathy towards the Church...

47:22.607 --> 47:24.307
Mason has none of these.

47:24.309 --> 47:27.510
For goodness sakes, Lambert,
we don't know anything yet.

47:31.249 --> 47:32.548
Mason.

47:32.550 --> 47:34.517
Don't
listen to him, Dad.

47:34.519 --> 47:37.253
Mason! Mason!

47:47.632 --> 47:49.565
You guys, you need to come up.

47:49.567 --> 47:50.967
Mason's awake.

48:03.014 --> 48:06.582
- It's cold.
- Mason? Mason, hi! Hi.

48:06.584 --> 48:13.584
<i>Exorcizamus te, omnis immunde spiritus,
omni satanica potestas...</i>

48:15.159 --> 48:17.560
<i>Omnis immunde spiritus,
omni satanica potestas...</i>

48:17.562 --> 48:19.095
What's he saying?

48:19.097 --> 48:21.214
The Roman Rites.

48:21.215 --> 48:23.332
I know it's the Roman Rites,
but how can it speak the holy...

48:23.334 --> 48:26.135
The Devil has to know the
scriptures in order to twist it.

48:27.472 --> 48:30.239
<i>Eradicare et effugare...</i>

48:34.979 --> 48:36.145
Mason!

48:43.521 --> 48:46.656
I believe you, but why
should I trust you?

48:47.525 --> 48:51.260
Because I've seen the work
of Abaddon before, my son.

48:56.434 --> 48:59.702
On a boy not much
older than your son.

48:59.703 --> 49:02.971
Imagine you're... you're drowning!
And he couldn't breathe, just like you now,

49:02.974 --> 49:08.411
with a thousand glass shards shooting
through his body, cutting him.

49:08.413 --> 49:13.282
The pain was so great that he claws at
his teeth and rips off his fingernails.

49:18.222 --> 49:23.292
We're not fighting physical
or spiritual deaths here.

49:23.294 --> 49:26.429
They will be redeemed
in God's eyes!

49:26.431 --> 49:29.732
It's the eternal death
that we fear.

49:31.436 --> 49:33.102
God doesn't abandon.

49:34.172 --> 49:36.339
But the Devil will take.

49:42.113 --> 49:45.314
I just want things to go
back to the way they were.

49:45.316 --> 49:50.119
I know this is a, a lot for
you to swallow at once.

49:50.121 --> 49:55.658
I've spent my entire life with the entities,
and I still have much to learn.

49:56.761 --> 49:58.561
But do not worry.

49:58.563 --> 50:00.096
This is the end.

50:01.566 --> 50:05.101
It's us against this world!

50:16.014 --> 50:17.213
I'll trust you.

50:17.215 --> 50:21.584
But if anything happens to Mason,
God won't save you from me.

50:26.357 --> 50:27.590
Do you have a cassock?

50:27.592 --> 50:30.626
I know
where to get one.

50:30.627 --> 50:33.661
All right. We're gonna need a few things.
We're gonna need a purple stole...

50:33.664 --> 50:37.299
- Mm.
- Two surplices, some holy water from the church.

50:37.301 --> 50:39.535
I need another copy
of the Roman Ritual.

50:40.471 --> 50:41.771
I'll be back with everything.

50:46.210 --> 50:48.444
I need someone
to go into that room.

50:48.446 --> 50:50.513
- He has to be restrained.
- What?

50:51.416 --> 50:54.216
- Okay. I can help with that.
- No, no, no, no, no.

50:54.218 --> 50:56.585
If anyone's restraining
my own son, it's me.

51:05.163 --> 51:09.265
"Our Father who art in heaven,
hallowed be Thy name."

51:09.267 --> 51:11.700
Come to us, Joel.

51:11.702 --> 51:14.537
Come to us!

51:14.539 --> 51:16.839
Hear us, Joel!

51:18.142 --> 51:20.843
It's just me, pal.
It's just daddy.

51:20.845 --> 51:26.816
"Thy kingdom come, thy will be done,
on earth as it is in heaven."

51:33.691 --> 51:37.093
"Give us this day
our daily bread.

51:37.095 --> 51:38.694
And forgive us our trespasses."

51:38.696 --> 51:41.831
Mr. Clarke. Mr. Clarke,
can you hear me?

51:43.234 --> 51:45.167
It is us who commands you.

51:45.803 --> 51:48.170
I have no idea what's going on.

51:48.172 --> 51:50.506
You need to wake up.

51:50.508 --> 51:52.741
You worship false Gods!

51:52.743 --> 51:56.579
Do you hear that? You
will rip his heart open!

51:58.816 --> 52:02.318
You're not Mason.
You're not Mason.

52:03.221 --> 52:04.653
Daddy?

52:04.655 --> 52:06.522
Forget them.

52:06.524 --> 52:08.124
Come to me.

52:11.762 --> 52:14.130
Don't you love me, Daddy?

52:16.701 --> 52:18.567
- Come here.
- Can you see me, Joel?

52:18.569 --> 52:19.869
Come back to me!

52:24.609 --> 52:27.476
Joel, Joel...

52:29.413 --> 52:33.249
Remember your greatest
weapon now is your faith.

52:42.593 --> 52:47.429
My son, know that I will fight
with my life for your salvation.

52:47.431 --> 52:49.498
I don't care about me, Father.

52:51.235 --> 52:53.802
I just... can't lose Mason.
He's all I've got.

52:54.805 --> 52:57.239
You don't have
to worry about him.

52:57.241 --> 52:58.707
I'll be here watching.

53:03.948 --> 53:06.916
What happens inside
someone that's possessed?

53:06.917 --> 53:09.885
Well, it begins with something simple, like
a babel in the head disguised as knowledge.

53:09.887 --> 53:14.723
You, you don't really the
word, but rather you feel it.

53:14.725 --> 53:19.395
Deny the existence of God
through incomplete science,

53:19.397 --> 53:24.700
looking for clues and proof
that God doesn't exist.

53:24.702 --> 53:26.335
Does he know he's possessed?

53:26.337 --> 53:27.903
No.

53:27.905 --> 53:30.272
They never know
until it is too late.

53:30.274 --> 53:36.845
Demons, they work in the shadows,
hiding and becoming familiar in your life.

53:36.847 --> 53:40.249
Many times,
you cannot differentiate between what's real

53:40.251 --> 53:42.651
and what is under
the Devil's influence.

53:44.555 --> 53:48.891
Sometimes you think you're in
control, and you finally realize

53:48.893 --> 53:55.364
that the Devil has such a hold on you
that only an exorcism can save you.

54:07.645 --> 54:14.645
You keep saying "demons," then you say,
"the Devil." Are they not different things?

54:14.752 --> 54:17.453
Well, demons are just a
form that the Devil takes.

54:17.455 --> 54:20.589
I mean, we use many
names just to confuse us.

54:20.591 --> 54:23.359
Like Mephistopheles, Lucifer...

54:23.361 --> 54:27.730
Whatever it is, if it's hurting
Mason, I want it gone.

54:28.933 --> 54:31.767
You are to stay put
through this whole thing.

54:31.769 --> 54:32.901
No, he's my son.

54:32.903 --> 54:35.571
You've seen what
its lies can do!

54:35.573 --> 54:38.874
We need you to stay objective
through this whole event.

54:38.876 --> 54:44.313
I've spent more time convincing the Church
that people are possessed than that they are.

54:44.315 --> 54:47.349
If anything happens
at this exorcism...

54:48.286 --> 54:50.319
I will be the first
one to stop it.

54:51.489 --> 54:54.923
I'm a woman of my word,
and a woman of science.

54:57.428 --> 54:58.428
It's time.

55:01.666 --> 55:02.731
This is it.

55:05.636 --> 55:08.971
Joel, are you ready
for the exorcism?

55:15.946 --> 55:17.413
Yes, Father.

55:34.532 --> 55:36.098
Does he even blink?

55:37.368 --> 55:40.336
The longer we wait during
the Affliction, the worse it is.

55:40.338 --> 55:41.737
There must be
something I can do.

55:43.374 --> 55:45.808
Just your undying faith
and submission to God.

55:46.644 --> 55:51.980
Maybe, maybe if I'm in there, if he gets
upset, I can talk him down, reason with him!

55:51.982 --> 55:55.351
This demon is different
than any other, Joel.

55:55.353 --> 55:56.819
You can't just reason with it.

55:56.821 --> 55:59.855
It's got no desires, no needs.

55:59.857 --> 56:03.025
You can't coax it
with love or negotiate.

56:03.027 --> 56:05.461
It feeds on the darkness within.

56:07.498 --> 56:11.633
You want to help? Keep the Lord's
Prayer close to you at all times.

56:43.534 --> 56:46.435
"In the name of Jesus
Christ, God and Lord...

56:49.774 --> 56:52.007
"Through the
intercession of the Immaculate Virgin,

56:52.009 --> 56:55.978
Mother of God, Mary and Holy
Michael the Archangel,

56:55.980 --> 57:01.717
we are about to undertake the
expulsion of a diabolical infestation,

57:01.719 --> 57:05.687
and all the Saints relying on the
holy authority of our office..."

57:05.689 --> 57:10.492
We are about to undertake the expulsion
of a diabolical infestation...

58:54.732 --> 59:00.669
Mmm! Ugh! Ugh!

01:00:01.365 --> 01:00:05.901
In the name and by the power of our
Lord Jesus Christ, we cast you out!

01:00:05.903 --> 01:00:12.608
Every unclean spirit, every satanic power,
every onslaught of the infernal adversary...

01:00:14.144 --> 01:00:17.879
In the name and by the
power of our Lord Jesus Christ...

01:00:20.918 --> 01:00:22.384
- It's burning!
- Come on.

01:00:43.941 --> 01:00:45.641
Here.

01:00:45.643 --> 01:00:47.409
Give me your clothes.
I'll wash them.

01:00:57.321 --> 01:00:59.121
Enough rest. We
gotta keep moving.

01:01:04.928 --> 01:01:06.128
Uh...

01:01:06.130 --> 01:01:08.096
Doctor, I-I have a question.

01:01:08.098 --> 01:01:10.999
Yes?

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:13.901
I heard Father Lambert say that
exorcism's legal. Is it true?

01:01:13.904 --> 01:01:15.937
The First Amendment
protects religious liberty,

01:01:15.939 --> 01:01:18.974
but it doesn't sanction
intentional abuse.

01:01:18.976 --> 01:01:22.911
But that's why I'm here, to make
sure that no abuse happens.

01:01:22.913 --> 01:01:26.181
It's a requirement by the
Church for exorcism.

01:01:26.183 --> 01:01:28.216
So, you believe in
demonic possession?

01:01:28.218 --> 01:01:33.088
It's my belief that possession
stems from a psychological guilt

01:01:33.090 --> 01:01:35.724
that religion has been
known to indoctrinate.

01:01:37.695 --> 01:01:40.462
I mean, but it could be,
like, ergot poisoning, huh,

01:01:40.464 --> 01:01:44.066
dermatographic
urticaria, epilepsy...

01:01:45.436 --> 01:01:46.935
schizophrenia.

01:01:47.905 --> 01:01:49.237
Schizophrenia?

01:01:49.239 --> 01:01:50.338
Yes.

01:01:50.340 --> 01:01:55.377
Uh, it's a psychosomatic
condition that's historically

01:01:55.379 --> 01:01:57.813
been confused with
demonic possession.

01:01:57.815 --> 01:01:59.047
Do you think he might
be schizophrenic?

01:01:59.049 --> 01:02:01.083
I've seen your medication, Joel.

01:02:02.319 --> 01:02:05.921
It has all gone on record
and into consideration.

01:02:05.923 --> 01:02:08.957
But that does not explain the
voices I heard inside of him.

01:02:10.027 --> 01:02:14.730
The poltergeist activity,
this allotriophagy. I...

01:02:14.732 --> 01:02:15.732
The allo what?

01:02:15.733 --> 01:02:18.033
Allotriophagy.

01:02:18.035 --> 01:02:21.970
It is a symptom of vomiting things
that should not be in our body,

01:02:21.972 --> 01:02:24.139
eating things that
should not be eaten.

01:02:24.141 --> 01:02:29.845
All I can tell you is that Mason is not
in any direct threat or risk right now.

01:02:30.848 --> 01:02:32.147
Thank you, doctor.

01:02:51.535 --> 01:02:52.535
Oh!

01:02:55.272 --> 01:02:57.339
Maya, you scared
the life out of me.

01:02:58.408 --> 01:03:00.175
What are you doing here?

01:03:00.177 --> 01:03:02.844
I told you I'd come by
and check up on Mason.

01:03:02.846 --> 01:03:04.913
No-no, wait-wait-wait, uh...

01:03:06.283 --> 01:03:07.283
What is it?

01:03:10.053 --> 01:03:11.420
Uhhh...

01:03:11.421 --> 01:03:12.788
Now's probably
not the best time.

01:03:14.391 --> 01:03:17.993
Joel, the purpose of my visit
is not at your convenience.

01:03:17.995 --> 01:03:21.296
"Now is not a good time" is the probably
the very reason why I should be here.

01:03:21.298 --> 01:03:22.831
Y-yeah, but I...

01:03:24.234 --> 01:03:26.034
Uh, ha-ha...

01:03:26.904 --> 01:03:29.070
uh, this is gonna sound insane.

01:03:29.072 --> 01:03:30.338
Insane?

01:03:30.340 --> 01:03:32.574
Yeah, uh...

01:03:33.877 --> 01:03:36.444
Mason's with
a priest right now. So...

01:03:37.948 --> 01:03:39.214
- Priest?
- Yeah.

01:03:39.216 --> 01:03:41.817
Um, something's
happened in the house.

01:03:41.819 --> 01:03:47.489
And I think that, um... I mean, we... think
that something's happened to Mason, and...

01:03:47.491 --> 01:03:49.257
Define "something happened."

01:03:50.427 --> 01:03:52.894
He's unconscious,
he's unresponsive.

01:03:52.896 --> 01:03:55.530
Joel, Mason needs
to see a doctor now!

01:03:55.532 --> 01:03:56.498
There's a doctor in the house.

01:03:56.500 --> 01:03:58.550
A priest or doctor?

01:03:58.551 --> 01:04:01.431
Both! There's both of them. They're
looking after him during the exorcism.

01:04:02.139 --> 01:04:04.339
Please, tell me you did
not just say "exorcism."

01:04:04.341 --> 01:04:06.775
Maya, it's completely safe.

01:04:06.776 --> 01:04:09.210
What, are you crazy?
You're subjecting your son to an exorcism?

01:04:09.213 --> 01:04:11.563
All the signs are there.

01:04:11.564 --> 01:04:13.914
They're there! H-h-he's
speaking in other languages,

01:04:13.917 --> 01:04:17.157
- there's just things flying around the house, and...
- Oh, so you're Catholic now?

01:04:20.123 --> 01:04:24.926
I've seen things that I
didn't believe in, until now.

01:04:25.896 --> 01:04:27.596
When were you last
on your medication?

01:04:27.598 --> 01:04:30.065
Uhhh, a few hours ago.

01:04:30.067 --> 01:04:32.017
Where are your pills?

01:04:32.018 --> 01:04:33.978
Um, they're upstairs.
I left them in the bathroom.

01:04:37.040 --> 01:04:42.277
Joel, you are destroying
everything we worked for.

01:04:42.279 --> 01:04:44.479
What choice do I have?

01:04:44.481 --> 01:04:46.281
Mason.

01:04:46.283 --> 01:04:48.483
Mason is your choice!

01:04:48.485 --> 01:04:52.621
If something happens to Mason, he needs
to get a proper psychiatric evaluation

01:04:52.623 --> 01:04:55.223
and medical check-up.
There are procedures and...

01:04:55.225 --> 01:04:56.925
Will you just trust me?

01:05:00.097 --> 01:05:01.897
Sorry.

01:05:01.899 --> 01:05:03.298
It's just...

01:05:06.069 --> 01:05:07.168
Right now...

01:05:08.472 --> 01:05:11.573
I don't have any other choice.

01:05:15.145 --> 01:05:17.045
You're saying there's
a doctor in there?

01:05:45.208 --> 01:05:47.275
This is so wrong.

01:05:47.277 --> 01:05:50.078
Hey, open up!

01:05:50.080 --> 01:05:51.346
They won't respond.

01:05:55.319 --> 01:05:58.153
I'm going to call the cops.
I mean, is that even a real doctor in there?

01:05:58.155 --> 01:05:59.988
Nobody's doing
anything in my house.

01:05:59.990 --> 01:06:03.224
I am... I am practicing my religious freedom.
This is legal.

01:06:03.226 --> 01:06:05.660
Not in your situation!

01:06:05.662 --> 01:06:07.729
Maya, just please.

01:06:07.731 --> 01:06:09.564
Just give me some time.

01:06:09.566 --> 01:06:11.767
Okay?

01:06:11.768 --> 01:06:14.208
And I'll take full responsibility
for all of it when it's over.

01:06:17.741 --> 01:06:19.741
I want to talk to the priest.

01:06:19.743 --> 01:06:25.547
You have 15 minutes, or I will have
the police, CPS, AHSC, you name it!

01:06:25.549 --> 01:06:28.650
I'll have the entire cavalry
here, if I have to.

01:06:28.652 --> 01:06:32.053
No one is leaving here until
I know what is going on.

01:06:32.055 --> 01:06:34.556
Just speak to him,
and you will see.

01:06:36.360 --> 01:06:39.127
Make it happen now.

01:06:40.564 --> 01:06:42.364
I'm gonna go check
on your pills.

01:06:42.366 --> 01:06:43.431
You better be taking them.

01:06:52.642 --> 01:06:58.480
"I command you, unclean spirit,
whoever you are, along with all your minions

01:06:58.482 --> 01:07:00.615
now attacking this
servant of God,

01:07:00.617 --> 01:07:03.351
by the mysteries of the incarnation,
passion, resurrection,

01:07:03.353 --> 01:07:06.021
and the ascension of
our Lord Jesus Christ!"

01:07:06.023 --> 01:07:08.223
"By the descent
of the Holy Spirit!"

01:07:11.762 --> 01:07:13.161
<i>Daddy!</i>

01:07:15.732 --> 01:07:17.065
<i>Daddy!</i>

01:07:25.075 --> 01:07:26.541
<i>There's
not much time!</i>

01:07:37.721 --> 01:07:39.454
<i>I sent you them!</i>

01:07:43.093 --> 01:07:45.126
<i>Come back to me.</i>

01:08:19.462 --> 01:08:20.562
Lambert!

01:08:28.839 --> 01:08:32.474
Father, my psychiatrist is here.
She's not happy. She wants to talk to you.

01:08:32.475 --> 01:08:34.509
Not now, my son.

01:08:34.511 --> 01:08:37.112
Whatever it is that's
happened can wait.

01:08:37.113 --> 01:08:38.379
What about him?

01:08:39.649 --> 01:08:42.149
This work's not cut
out for everybody.

01:08:42.152 --> 01:08:45.687
What... what does that mean? Where...
how's the exorcism going? How's Mason?

01:08:51.661 --> 01:08:55.296
Now is the time for the Assent.

01:08:57.234 --> 01:09:02.804
Whatever happens now,
whatever choices between good and evil,

01:09:03.773 --> 01:09:05.273
will be forever.

01:09:06.609 --> 01:09:07.709
How much longer?

01:09:11.781 --> 01:09:13.715
It's all in God's hands.

01:09:34.304 --> 01:09:36.270
There you are.

01:09:55.525 --> 01:09:57.192
I've got you now.

01:09:58.895 --> 01:10:00.895
No one can touch you.

01:10:12.242 --> 01:10:13.775
God, this is too much.

01:10:16.279 --> 01:10:18.980
I won't rest until I destroy
and abolish this demon.

01:10:18.982 --> 01:10:21.516
You promise me you
won't let him go?

01:10:22.819 --> 01:10:24.919
Mason'll be fine.

01:10:24.921 --> 01:10:27.355
He'll have his life back
when this is all over.

01:10:28.391 --> 01:10:31.526
You know, you are the first person
I trust that will take care of him.

01:10:33.396 --> 01:10:35.296
I lost one once.

01:10:36.433 --> 01:10:38.766
I won't let this happen again.

01:10:47.577 --> 01:10:48.676
Maya.

01:10:53.550 --> 01:10:54.649
Maya!

01:10:54.651 --> 01:10:55.917
Joel...

01:10:58.455 --> 01:11:01.289
Is this what all this is about?

01:11:01.291 --> 01:11:02.557
So, you believe me now?

01:11:02.559 --> 01:11:03.992
Believe you?

01:11:03.994 --> 01:11:10.732
Dust specks, lens reflections, motion blur...
these are all just natural causes from technology.

01:11:10.734 --> 01:11:12.234
No, no, no, no.

01:11:12.235 --> 01:11:13.735
What about this one? What
about, what about the shadow?

01:11:13.737 --> 01:11:14.869
Finger on the lens.

01:11:14.871 --> 01:11:15.937
In the middle?

01:11:17.307 --> 01:11:19.307
Maya!

01:11:19.308 --> 01:11:21.308
No, Joel. You need
to stop all this now!

01:11:21.311 --> 01:11:24.712
You haven't seen what I've seen.

01:11:28.318 --> 01:11:31.519
Maybe it's because you haven't
been taking your medication.

01:11:37.527 --> 01:11:38.559
Joel.

01:11:40.463 --> 01:11:41.696
Listen to me.

01:11:45.568 --> 01:11:48.803
Remember when I told you
about making choices?

01:11:50.573 --> 01:11:52.874
You're gonna have
to make a choice now.

01:11:53.877 --> 01:11:55.043
For you.

01:11:56.646 --> 01:11:57.879
For Mason.

01:11:59.082 --> 01:12:02.583
It's all in your head!

01:12:02.585 --> 01:12:08.456
You can vanquish this, just say
it. You can make the choice.

01:12:09.993 --> 01:12:11.926
Choice?

01:12:11.928 --> 01:12:13.728
What choice?

01:12:13.730 --> 01:12:15.530
<i>I tried to warn you!</i>

01:12:19.436 --> 01:12:21.069
Do you trust me?

01:12:23.373 --> 01:12:25.106
I'm so tired!

01:12:30.847 --> 01:12:33.348
Do you believe in me, Joel?

01:12:37.520 --> 01:12:39.887
I can fix this.

01:12:41.124 --> 01:12:43.524
You won't have to worry anymore.

01:12:45.795 --> 01:12:48.062
Just surrender to me.

01:12:51.134 --> 01:12:53.000
Can you do that, Joel?

01:13:02.812 --> 01:13:05.546
That's all I need
from you, Joel.

01:13:10.620 --> 01:13:13.654
We can do this together.

01:13:13.656 --> 01:13:16.124
I need you to say
it one more time.

01:13:16.126 --> 01:13:17.892
You gotta mean it!

01:13:20.697 --> 01:13:21.796
Yes.

01:13:22.699 --> 01:13:23.731
Yes!

01:13:28.138 --> 01:13:29.437
Yes!

01:13:38.782 --> 01:13:39.847
It's over.

01:13:58.935 --> 01:14:00.067
Maya?

01:14:05.508 --> 01:14:06.541
Mason?

01:14:15.485 --> 01:14:16.485
Mason.

01:14:44.047 --> 01:14:45.079
Lambert!

01:14:46.683 --> 01:14:47.715
Lambert!

01:14:52.555 --> 01:14:54.255
Lambert!

01:14:54.256 --> 01:14:55.956
<i>Daddy, Daddy, wake up!</i>

01:14:55.959 --> 01:14:57.558
Father Michael!

01:14:57.560 --> 01:14:58.259
Daddy!

01:14:58.261 --> 01:14:59.961
Hawkins?

01:15:02.131 --> 01:15:03.598
Anyone!

01:15:06.936 --> 01:15:09.537
<i>We were trying to save you.</i>

01:15:10.607 --> 01:15:11.973
It begins
with something simple,

01:15:11.975 --> 01:15:15.243
like a babel in the head
disguised as knowledge.

01:15:16.779 --> 01:15:20.548
You not only hear the
word, but rather you feel it.

01:15:21.684 --> 01:15:23.618
You've been marked
by him, my son.

01:15:23.620 --> 01:15:27.121
- Joel, you're the one that needs attention right now.
- Check on my son.

01:15:28.024 --> 01:15:34.729
Demons, they work in the shadows,
hiding and becoming familiar in your life.

01:15:34.731 --> 01:15:38.032
Many times,
you cannot differentiate between what's real

01:15:38.034 --> 01:15:41.068
and what is under
the Devil's influence.

01:15:41.070 --> 01:15:45.573
Sometimes you think you're in control,
and you finally realize that the Devil

01:15:45.575 --> 01:15:51.078
has such a hold on you that only
an exorcism can save you.

01:15:58.555 --> 01:16:02.723
Reality blinds those who only
see what they want to see.

01:16:05.662 --> 01:16:08.095
The eyes are useless
when the mind is blind.

01:16:08.097 --> 01:16:09.564
What... ahhh...

01:16:12.268 --> 01:16:16.671
The priest believed an exorcism would save
him, but it only brought you closer to me.

01:16:16.673 --> 01:16:17.838
No.

01:16:18.841 --> 01:16:20.575
He was helping Mason.

01:16:22.211 --> 01:16:23.611
We'll see.

01:16:27.317 --> 01:16:31.636
Joel, Joel, Joel!

01:16:31.637 --> 01:16:35.956
Or were you so blinded by imperfection,
you believed your son was afflicted?

01:16:35.959 --> 01:16:40.127
Mason saw the darkness in you,
the same way he sees many things.

01:16:40.129 --> 01:16:41.729
You tricked me!

01:16:42.632 --> 01:16:43.831
No.

01:16:46.970 --> 01:16:49.337
You assented.

01:16:49.339 --> 01:16:55.209
You heard the voices calling out for you
during the exorcism, and yet you paid no heed.

01:16:55.211 --> 01:16:59.246
You're so far into the darkness that
your soul has become part of it.

01:16:59.248 --> 01:17:00.681
Where's Mason?

01:17:01.651 --> 01:17:03.918
Where's my son?

01:17:05.121 --> 01:17:08.823
Do not concern yourself
with the outside world.

01:17:08.825 --> 01:17:14.762
You built this house and your mind
with the darkness and your sickness.

01:17:19.035 --> 01:17:21.135
That's why I choose you, Joel.

01:17:24.307 --> 01:17:26.273
My life is nothing
without Mason.

01:17:27.677 --> 01:17:29.043
He's all that matters.

01:17:30.880 --> 01:17:35.082
In time, he will make
his own choice.

01:17:36.185 --> 01:17:41.322
And as life spirals into oblivion
from his parents abandoning him,

01:17:41.324 --> 01:17:43.190
we shall be there waiting.

01:17:45.028 --> 01:17:48.295
Don't you worry.
We'll get him back.

01:17:48.297 --> 01:17:50.264
You don't touch Mason!

01:17:51.701 --> 01:17:54.101
It'll be his choice.

01:17:55.271 --> 01:17:58.439
That'll always be a choice.

01:17:59.809 --> 01:18:02.410
You are just the first, Joel.

01:18:05.448 --> 01:18:10.851
Together, we will build our
orphanages in darkness.

01:18:12.155 --> 01:18:15.089
For the children of filth.

01:18:18.828 --> 01:18:23.964
<i>Every possession by a
demon occurs during three stages.</i>

01:18:23.966 --> 01:18:26.834
<i>The first is called
the Presence.</i>

01:18:27.470 --> 01:18:33.874
<i>This is when a demon or entity begins
to make its presence known to the host.</i>

01:18:33.876 --> 01:18:37.812
<i>The second stage
is called the Affliction,</i>

01:18:37.814 --> 01:18:43.417
<i>when the entity begins to possess
and inhibit the body of its host,</i>

01:18:43.419 --> 01:18:48.155
<i>taking over all control of their physical,
mental and spiritual ability.</i>

01:18:49.392 --> 01:18:56.030
<i>The infected begins to feel dirty,
like a pungent force taking over.</i>

01:18:56.966 --> 01:19:03.037
<i>But the demon cannot fully infect and
take over a person until the third stage,</i>

01:19:03.039 --> 01:19:05.840
<i>which is known as the Assent.</i>

01:19:06.843 --> 01:19:10.444
<i>It's when a person has finally
surrendered and consents to the demon</i>

01:19:10.446 --> 01:19:12.279
<i>as being a part of their soul.</i>

01:19:12.281 --> 01:19:14.315
Who are you talking to?

01:19:14.317 --> 01:19:16.283
Someone who thinks
they can help us.

01:19:19.422 --> 01:19:25.993
<i>Remember this: The
Devil makes the sane insane.</i>

01:19:25.995 --> 01:19:28.329
<i>And the insane, sane.</i>

01:19:29.432 --> 01:19:33.067
Joel, are you ready
for the exorcism?

01:19:35.838 --> 01:19:37.171
Yes, Father.

01:20:04.400 --> 01:20:05.533
Mason?

01:20:07.003 --> 01:20:08.936
It's late.

01:20:08.938 --> 01:20:10.304
You should be in bed now.

01:20:11.941 --> 01:20:13.040
Okay.

01:20:14.577 --> 01:20:15.876
Look.

01:20:17.113 --> 01:20:21.415
I know how hard it's been,
after all these years.

01:20:23.319 --> 01:20:25.386
But you're making
great progress.

01:20:26.389 --> 01:20:27.588
I just...

01:20:29.492 --> 01:20:31.225
miss him sometimes.

01:20:35.131 --> 01:20:38.499
Letting go doesn't mean
that you have to forget him.

01:20:39.602 --> 01:20:42.903
It means it's time to move on.

01:20:47.076 --> 01:20:48.976
I think I'm gonna
try to sleep now.

01:20:50.079 --> 01:20:51.245
Okay.

01:21:32.655 --> 01:21:37.124
<i>Who are you? My name is Camper.</i>

01:21:37.126 --> 01:21:39.460
<i>Will you be my friend?</i>
