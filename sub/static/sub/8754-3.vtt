WEBVTT

00:10.923 --> 00:14.858
These tricksters are awful... awful, awful.

00:14.860 --> 00:18.328
I saw three shadow figures
here at the foot of the bed.

00:18.330 --> 00:22.599
They're making them see things,
hear things, feel things.

00:22.601 --> 00:24.868
She found him hanging from the rafters.

00:24.870 --> 00:26.470
Something just goes "Boom!"

00:27.339 --> 00:30.073
This is some bizarre [bleep]
you guys are talking about.

00:31.076 --> 00:33.143
I don't know what to trust.

00:33.145 --> 00:37.080
He's making me crazy.

00:37.583 --> 00:39.783
Something bad's going to happen.

00:39.785 --> 00:42.686
My name is Amy Allan.

00:42.688 --> 00:44.054
There's panic.

00:44.056 --> 00:45.489
And it's almost like a butchering.

00:45.491 --> 00:46.556
I see dead people.

00:46.558 --> 00:48.692
They all died horribly.

00:48.694 --> 00:50.394
I speak to dead people.

00:50.396 --> 00:51.795
Get out of here.

00:51.797 --> 00:53.430
And they speak to me.

00:53.432 --> 00:55.465
Vicious.

00:55.467 --> 00:58.602
But there's only one way to
know if my findings are real.

00:58.604 --> 01:00.303
It doesn't matter where you are.
I'll find you.

01:00.305 --> 01:01.872
I rely on my partner.

01:01.874 --> 01:03.507
I'm Steve Di Schiavi.

01:03.509 --> 01:05.409
I'm a retired New York
City homicide detective.

01:05.411 --> 01:07.110
This guy's a real piece of work.

01:07.112 --> 01:10.781
And I know every person,
every house has secrets.

01:10.783 --> 01:12.282
I feel like I live in a house of Hell.

01:12.284 --> 01:13.450
It's my job to reveal them.

01:13.452 --> 01:15.719
This is not good.

01:15.721 --> 01:17.487
But Steve and I never speak...

01:17.489 --> 01:19.489
We never communicate
during an investigation.

01:19.491 --> 01:21.258
Until the very end...

01:21.260 --> 01:22.726
I want my life back.

01:22.728 --> 01:24.928
When we uncover if it's
safe for you to stay...

01:24.930 --> 01:26.730
Is he trying to kill her?

01:26.732 --> 01:27.998
Or time to get out.

01:28.000 --> 01:29.533
Oh, my god.

01:29.535 --> 01:31.034
This is going to kill us.

01:33.000 --> 01:39.074

01:47.903 --> 01:50.287
I'm in the rural town of Independence,
Oregon.

01:50.289 --> 01:52.255
It's about an hour south of Portland.

01:53.909 --> 01:55.725
I got called in by a guy named Terry,

01:55.727 --> 01:57.794
who sounded really desperate on the phone.

01:57.796 --> 02:01.364
He says the activity in
his farmhouse is so bad,

02:01.366 --> 02:03.633
it's destroying his health
<i>and</i> his relationship.

02:03.635 --> 02:06.937
He says if we can't help him,

02:06.939 --> 02:09.038
he doesn't think he's
gonna last another year.

02:15.114 --> 02:18.231
Before Amy arrives,
I clear the house

02:18.233 --> 02:21.368
of anything that might
influence her findings.

02:21.370 --> 02:24.454
Photos need to be removed...

02:24.456 --> 02:27.357
and personal items covered.

02:27.359 --> 02:28.608
When I'm finished,

02:28.610 --> 02:31.661
the location will be
ready for tonight's walk.

02:42.774 --> 02:46.143
Okay. Okay.

02:46.145 --> 02:49.246
I had a really hard time opening.

02:49.248 --> 02:53.300
The thing was, was that there were,
like, these tricksters.

02:53.302 --> 02:58.288
They are treacherous... thieves and liars.

02:58.290 --> 03:00.223
They're creating illusions,

03:00.225 --> 03:04.227
and they are going into people's dreams.

03:05.764 --> 03:06.796
What the [bleep]

03:06.798 --> 03:10.934
They're having bad, horrible dreams.

03:10.936 --> 03:13.420
This is not good.

03:24.516 --> 03:25.899
Terry, I'm glad I'm here,

03:25.901 --> 03:27.350
'cause when we spoke on the phone,

03:27.352 --> 03:28.652
you sounded pretty desperate.

03:28.654 --> 03:31.087
What exactly is going on in the house?

03:31.089 --> 03:33.256
Oh, gosh. We hear voices.

03:33.258 --> 03:34.758
There's full-body apparitions.

03:34.760 --> 03:37.561
I've been chased down the hallway.

03:40.098 --> 03:41.765
I just feel like something's here

03:41.767 --> 03:43.950
trying to suck the life out of me.

03:43.952 --> 03:45.235
Wow.

03:45.237 --> 03:46.570
So, who exactly lives in the house?

03:46.572 --> 03:50.740
Me, my partner, Bobby,
and my grandson, Ashton.

03:50.742 --> 03:53.777
I think it's now starting
after my grandson.

03:54.813 --> 03:57.447
All right.
So, how long have you been living here?

03:57.449 --> 03:59.416
We've been here four years.

03:59.418 --> 04:01.084
What made you come here?

04:01.086 --> 04:03.520
With my parents being elderly,
Bobby and I decided

04:03.522 --> 04:06.106
that it would probably be
best if we moved down here

04:06.108 --> 04:08.391
to help take care of
the farm and my parents.

04:08.393 --> 04:10.694
Okay. So, did you grow up in this house?

04:10.696 --> 04:13.063
No. This house has been moved here.

04:13.065 --> 04:16.466
We had an old farmhouse over
there that I grew up in.

04:16.468 --> 04:17.767
Okay.

04:17.769 --> 04:20.737
Things have progressively gotten
worse over this last year.

04:20.738 --> 04:22.639
I've been attacked in my bed.

04:22.641 --> 04:25.742
I'm getting no sleep... none.

04:25.744 --> 04:29.112
I get very irritable
when my anxiety goes up.

04:29.114 --> 04:30.614
I know on the phone, when we spoke,

04:30.616 --> 04:32.749
it seems like your
relationship's a little strained

04:32.751 --> 04:34.551
because of this stuff that's going on.

04:34.553 --> 04:36.920
It <i> is</i> a little strained.
I don't want to be bothered.

04:36.922 --> 04:40.590
I just kind of want to be alone,
and that's not me at all.

04:40.592 --> 04:42.025
Now, what about your grandson?

04:42.027 --> 04:44.661
He is so scared,
he won't go to the bath alone.

04:44.663 --> 04:46.596
He doesn't want to sleep alone.

04:48.500 --> 04:50.500
I'm sorry.

04:50.502 --> 04:53.937
I don't know how to protect my family.

04:53.939 --> 04:55.672
Yeah.

04:55.674 --> 04:57.974
I am at my wits' end.

05:05.317 --> 05:07.550
What the hell?

05:09.855 --> 05:12.389
There's a man...

05:12.391 --> 05:14.524
Oh, a living dude.

05:14.526 --> 05:16.893
He's just, like, barreling through here

05:16.895 --> 05:18.428
and yelling and screaming.

05:18.430 --> 05:21.998
And he's got brown hair.

05:22.000 --> 05:24.801
Kind of got a round face,
kind of a roundish face.

05:24.803 --> 05:26.536
Kind of, like, always a mess.

05:26.538 --> 05:28.438
How old?

05:28.440 --> 05:30.774
Probably in his early 40s.

05:30.776 --> 05:31.808
Okay.

05:31.810 --> 05:34.344
Not a happy person.

05:40.118 --> 05:42.686
Okay, now I'm seeing a bunch of [bleep]

05:46.241 --> 05:48.992
I think there's a [bleep] telepath here

05:48.994 --> 05:53.863
who is inadvertently
manipulating their environment.

05:53.865 --> 05:54.864
How?

05:54.866 --> 05:56.950
Like, the living people here

05:56.952 --> 05:59.853
are seeing things that aren't really there.

06:01.606 --> 06:03.506
He's making me crazy.

06:11.416 --> 06:14.984
One of my very first
really scary experiences

06:14.986 --> 06:16.419
happened here.

06:16.421 --> 06:17.854
I used to have a mirror

06:17.856 --> 06:21.458
that hung in my bedroom at
the end of this hallway,

06:21.460 --> 06:23.793
and I was coming through one afternoon

06:23.795 --> 06:26.162
with a load of towels from the laundry,

06:26.164 --> 06:28.531
and I just got this overwhelming feeling

06:28.533 --> 06:30.367
that somebody was behind me.

06:30.369 --> 06:33.703
And as I happened to
look up down the hallway

06:33.705 --> 06:36.940
and into that mirror,
I saw an old man behind me,

06:36.942 --> 06:39.275
I would say probably in his 70s.

06:39.277 --> 06:42.612
He was kind of see-through,
more of, like, a gray thing,

06:42.614 --> 06:46.850
and he was coming behind
me down the hallway.

06:46.852 --> 06:51.521
I ran and slammed the
bedroom door behind me.

06:51.523 --> 06:53.640
Could it have been an intruder
or anything like that?

06:53.642 --> 06:54.924
No.

06:54.926 --> 06:57.861
I open the door back up...
There's nothing here.

06:57.863 --> 07:00.230
Interesting. Okay,
so what else is going on in this hallway?

07:00.232 --> 07:02.565
I hear women's voices
out in the living room.

07:02.567 --> 07:04.968
It's like a murmuring.

07:04.970 --> 07:07.670
You just kind of hear...

07:07.672 --> 07:08.671
That's annoying.

07:08.673 --> 07:09.739
Very.

07:09.741 --> 07:11.508
How many people would you think it is?

07:11.510 --> 07:13.276
Probably three to four.

07:13.278 --> 07:14.577
Do you go investigate?

07:14.579 --> 07:15.995
Yes, I usually get up.

07:15.997 --> 07:18.948
There have been times I've
been kind of confrontational.

07:18.950 --> 07:20.116
And what have you said?

07:20.118 --> 07:21.851
"Get out of my house."

07:21.853 --> 07:23.219
And what happens?

07:23.221 --> 07:24.888
It makes it worse.

07:24.890 --> 07:26.256
They're bullying me.

07:26.258 --> 07:28.625
I never had circles under my eyes

07:28.627 --> 07:31.561
until I came back here
and moved into this house.

07:31.563 --> 07:32.729
Okay.

07:42.073 --> 07:43.406
Oh, boy.

07:47.979 --> 07:50.513
These, like, trickster things...

07:50.515 --> 07:53.550
there's a lot of them... a lot of them.

07:53.552 --> 07:55.135
How many?

07:58.123 --> 07:59.422
50?

07:59.424 --> 08:04.828
But I don't know if I'm...
seeing the truth.

08:07.966 --> 08:11.000
These tricksters are incredibly
good at distorting reality.

08:11.002 --> 08:16.506
Between them and the telepathy,
the living must be going insane.

08:16.508 --> 08:20.310
They'll feed into the
person's paranoias and fears.

08:20.312 --> 08:24.714
They can reach in and pull out past traumas

08:24.716 --> 08:27.650
and make it a fresh issue for them,

08:27.652 --> 08:31.187
and they, like, overanalyze it
and analyze it and analyze it,

08:31.189 --> 08:32.655
talking, talking, talking,

08:32.657 --> 08:35.258
and it's like feeding it
more and more and more.

08:43.268 --> 08:48.838
One night,
I woke up and I saw three shadow figures

08:48.840 --> 08:50.857
down here at the foot of the bed

08:50.859 --> 08:53.576
that I would say were
probably about this tall

08:53.578 --> 08:57.447
and looked like black blobs...
kind of human shape.

08:57.449 --> 09:01.217
I freaked out, jumped up out of bed,
and I ran out.

09:01.219 --> 09:03.186
I was scared to death.

09:03.188 --> 09:06.055
You're sure there's no shadows
coming in from outside?

09:06.057 --> 09:08.224
Those are block-out curtains,
and they're closed.

09:08.226 --> 09:10.226
Huh.

09:10.228 --> 09:12.328
Actually, after we had called you,

09:12.330 --> 09:16.332
the other night,
I got attacked in my bed again.

09:16.334 --> 09:18.134
I was watching TV.

09:18.136 --> 09:21.437
I rolled over to grab
the remote, and again,

09:21.439 --> 09:24.324
there was a large shadow
figure standing over me,

09:24.326 --> 09:25.975
leaning in the bed.

09:25.977 --> 09:27.393
I started swinging.

09:27.395 --> 09:30.880
I thought maybe somebody
had broken into the house.

09:30.882 --> 09:33.116
And it just disappeared.

09:33.118 --> 09:36.035
When you said you were desperate,
you weren't kidding.

09:36.037 --> 09:39.172
No. It feels like I'm being tortured.

09:42.410 --> 09:45.695
I feel sick... horrible,
horrible [bleep] sick in here.

09:45.697 --> 09:47.130
Awful, awful, awful.

09:47.132 --> 09:49.799
These tricksters,

09:49.801 --> 09:52.969
they are causing their own mayhem here.

09:52.971 --> 09:54.871
Are you okay?

09:54.873 --> 09:58.174
They're [bleep] with me.

09:58.176 --> 09:59.609
Real physical. Okay [bleep]

09:59.611 --> 10:01.244
Ah. Come on. Come on.

10:02.664 --> 10:05.982
They come. They come. They come.

10:05.984 --> 10:07.450
And they do. They surround...

10:07.452 --> 10:09.786
They do... They do it...
They'll surround any bed

10:09.788 --> 10:11.821
that has a living person in them at night.

10:15.093 --> 10:17.260
They're like this big, and they're black...

10:17.262 --> 10:20.430
you know, black humanoid figures.

10:20.432 --> 10:23.783
And they all are standing together.

10:28.039 --> 10:30.273
They come in the front door.
They crawl out of the closets.

10:31.476 --> 10:35.211
They're attracted to the
negativity in this house.

10:35.213 --> 10:38.781
They're having a good time feeding this.

10:38.783 --> 10:41.618
It's not like they're like,
"I'm gonna kill this person,

10:41.620 --> 10:43.553
but if something happens, great.

10:43.555 --> 10:46.055
That would be [bleep] entertaining."

10:46.057 --> 10:49.459
They're like, "Yeah, let's keep this going.

10:49.461 --> 10:50.293
Let's do this!"

11:12.309 --> 11:14.059
Terry mentioned to me

11:14.061 --> 11:16.678
about his short tempers, his mood swings.

11:16.680 --> 11:18.263
Have you noticed what he's talking about?

11:18.265 --> 11:19.514
Yeah.

11:19.516 --> 11:21.516
In the beginning,
when we first got together,

11:21.518 --> 11:24.536
he was so lovable and just happy.

11:24.538 --> 11:26.421
Just watching somebody go downhill,

11:26.423 --> 11:27.723
you don't want to see it.

11:27.725 --> 11:29.758
And there's a couple of times

11:29.760 --> 11:33.161
where I've actually, like,
wanted to just walk away.

11:33.163 --> 11:34.496
Okay.

11:34.498 --> 11:38.100
Now, what about yourself?
What have you experienced?

11:38.102 --> 11:39.868
I have seen something that
actually terrifies me.

11:39.870 --> 11:40.786
Okay.

11:40.788 --> 11:42.637
It's a little shadow figure.

11:42.639 --> 11:46.308
It's probably about 2 feet tall,
about up to your knee,

11:46.310 --> 11:48.977
and it peeks around the corner at you.

11:48.979 --> 11:53.281
It's got kind of like a troll-
or gremlin-looking shape to it,

11:53.283 --> 11:55.584
with pointed ears.

11:55.586 --> 11:58.420
You don't think it's any kind of
an animal or anything like that?

11:58.422 --> 11:59.788
You sure of that?

11:59.790 --> 12:01.990
It's too big to be any kind of rodent.

12:01.992 --> 12:03.358
Okay.

12:03.360 --> 12:05.527
And you would have heard it
if it was some animal, huh?

12:05.529 --> 12:07.012
Yeah. There's no sound to it.

12:08.198 --> 12:09.464
Is there anything else going on?

12:09.466 --> 12:11.299
I saw this little fawn

12:11.301 --> 12:14.269
actually hop through the
back window in the bedroom,

12:14.271 --> 12:17.005
and it went through the bedroom

12:17.007 --> 12:19.007
and then took off down the hallway.

12:19.009 --> 12:20.642
You're talking about a baby deer?

12:20.644 --> 12:21.910
Yeah.

12:21.912 --> 12:24.045
This is some bizarre [bleep]
you guys are talking about.

12:24.047 --> 12:25.781
I haven't heard this
much stuff in one house.

12:25.783 --> 12:28.316
I thought I was going crazy at one point.

12:28.318 --> 12:29.885
- Were you boozing?
- No. I don't drink.

12:29.887 --> 12:31.620
You don't drink? All right. Any drugs?

12:31.622 --> 12:32.687
Nope.

12:32.689 --> 12:34.773
I have no idea what that could have been.

12:34.775 --> 12:36.792
You can see why I thought
I was going crazy.

12:40.047 --> 12:42.714
I'm having a lot of issues

12:42.716 --> 12:47.435
trying to figure out what
is really going on here.

12:47.437 --> 12:53.575
But these tricksters...
They <i> are</i> causing issues.

12:53.577 --> 12:57.145
Like, there's infinite possibilities

12:57.147 --> 12:59.281
of how they can manipulate the living

12:59.283 --> 13:04.286
into making them, you know,
behave in a certain way

13:04.288 --> 13:10.158
or, you know, see things,
hear things, feel things.

13:10.160 --> 13:12.777
They're causing, you know, fighting.

13:12.779 --> 13:16.014
They'll pit people against
each other so they'll fight.

13:16.016 --> 13:18.600
They'll cause a lot of arguments and anger.

13:20.771 --> 13:26.308
One person will hear the
other person talking to them,

13:26.310 --> 13:28.310
but it's not them.

13:28.312 --> 13:31.646
They manipulate dreams.

13:31.648 --> 13:37.219
They are making it a very negative,
volatile situation.

13:37.221 --> 13:40.822
And they are really feeding at night.

13:49.132 --> 13:51.366
So, Ashton, I talked to Grandpa,

13:51.368 --> 13:53.768
and he's worried about you.

13:53.770 --> 13:55.770
He wanted me to talk to you.

13:55.772 --> 13:56.838
How old are you, exactly?

13:56.840 --> 13:57.839
7.

13:57.841 --> 13:59.507
7? Okay.

13:59.509 --> 14:01.676
Do you see anything in the
house that frightens you?

14:04.248 --> 14:05.881
Tell me about that.

14:05.883 --> 14:09.301
I saw something come through the closet...

14:09.303 --> 14:11.119
the closet in that room.

14:13.106 --> 14:14.589
It was like red eyes,

14:14.591 --> 14:17.158
and it was like a demon or something.

14:18.595 --> 14:21.496
And it came on my side of the bed,

14:21.498 --> 14:25.333
and I felt something
tickling me right here.

14:25.335 --> 14:27.569
Are you afraid to stay here?

14:29.106 --> 14:30.405
You are?

14:30.407 --> 14:33.124
Why are you afraid? Tell me.

14:33.126 --> 14:38.179
Because I see stuff moving in
the hallway and the bathroom.

14:38.181 --> 14:39.714
What are you seeing?

14:39.716 --> 14:42.384
All night, I see, like, a tall man.

14:42.386 --> 14:45.353
I stay up almost all night.

14:50.394 --> 14:55.130
The little trickster dudes
are different in here.

14:55.132 --> 14:58.166
They're more active in here
as far as what they do.

15:02.072 --> 15:05.206
Here, they're more aggressive.

15:05.208 --> 15:07.175
They're, like, jumping on the bed

15:07.177 --> 15:09.828
like they're having a good time,

15:09.830 --> 15:12.180
barking and growling.

15:13.183 --> 15:16.351
And I see, like...

15:16.353 --> 15:19.187
I see somebody's in there.
Somebody's in the bed.

15:22.009 --> 15:23.992
And they're trying to relax.

15:23.994 --> 15:25.660
They're seeing, like...

15:27.030 --> 15:29.464
Like, um...

15:29.466 --> 15:31.700
Uh, like, all this movement, like lights...

15:32.669 --> 15:36.404
and, like, you know, black,
streaky things and lights

15:36.406 --> 15:38.306
and, like, all this chaos.

15:39.776 --> 15:43.078
And they're just like, "Oh, man.
This is really bad."

15:57.425 --> 15:59.124
Terry and Bobby have no clue

15:59.126 --> 16:00.976
about the history of their house,

16:00.978 --> 16:02.277
so I pulled the property deed

16:02.279 --> 16:04.246
and asked a local historian that I know

16:04.248 --> 16:05.981
to look through some of the names.

16:05.983 --> 16:08.984
Turns out the original property owner

16:08.986 --> 16:10.152
was publicly disgraced

16:10.154 --> 16:12.354
and had to leave Independence in shame.

16:17.661 --> 16:19.827
Well, Diane,
I appreciate you helping me out.

16:19.829 --> 16:22.213
So, what can you tell me
about this guy Alva Shaw,

16:22.215 --> 16:24.332
who originally owned my clients' property?

16:24.334 --> 16:27.952
He was born in New York about 1819,

16:27.954 --> 16:29.772
and he came to Oregon in 1844.

16:29.872 --> 16:31.401
Okay. So, what did he do when he got here?

16:31.501 --> 16:34.335
He was appointed by the governor
to be the superintendent

16:34.337 --> 16:36.404
of the state penitentiary in Portland.

16:36.406 --> 16:39.935
Okay, I mean,
that's a pretty prestigious job

16:40.035 --> 16:40.801
and powerful job.

16:40.901 --> 16:42.234
- He's got to have a lot of connections.
- He did.

16:42.236 --> 16:43.381
How'd it work out?

16:43.481 --> 16:45.639
Of the 154 prisoners

16:45.739 --> 16:48.673
that were sent to the
prison during his term,

16:48.675 --> 16:52.377
44 of them escaped,
and only 13 were recaptured.

16:52.835 --> 16:54.168
So 1/3 of his prisoners escaped?

16:54.170 --> 16:56.120
Yes. He was blamed for that.

16:56.122 --> 16:57.137
Okay.

17:05.047 --> 17:06.946
As soon as I walk outside,

17:06.949 --> 17:09.782
it's like a haze has been lifted off of me,

17:09.785 --> 17:12.152
and I'm able to see clearly again,

17:12.154 --> 17:15.321
and there's someone here,
watching my every move.

17:15.324 --> 17:21.895
I think that he's a dead man...
a very powerful man.

17:21.896 --> 17:27.835
I think he had a lot of power
that was placed upon him,

17:27.837 --> 17:30.604
a lot of strength, a lot of determination,

17:30.606 --> 17:32.706
a lot of authority, and I think that's why

17:32.708 --> 17:35.576
he's so capable of manifesting this way.

17:38.481 --> 17:40.514
Do you know when he's from?

17:40.516 --> 17:41.932
80 to 100 years ago?

17:41.934 --> 17:42.950
Okay.

17:42.952 --> 17:45.586
Do people experience him in any way?

17:45.588 --> 17:47.988
I would assume so,

17:47.990 --> 17:50.891
'cause he does have a
thing with the tricksters.

17:51.794 --> 17:54.678
You know,
the only thing I could possibly say

17:54.680 --> 17:57.364
is that he would be some kind of leader.

17:58.334 --> 18:00.484
Now, you mentioned this
guy had a bad go of things.

18:00.486 --> 18:02.069
- What are we talking about?
- He did.

18:02.071 --> 18:06.206
He had a very bad go of things,
starting in August 1866.

18:06.208 --> 18:10.077
First thing that happened is
his mother died... Hannah Shaw.

18:10.079 --> 18:11.545
Okay.

18:11.547 --> 18:15.616
She died on August 12th,
and she was 71 years old.

18:15.618 --> 18:17.751
And she was buried on your clients'
property.

18:17.753 --> 18:19.486
- She's buried on the property?
- Yes.

18:19.488 --> 18:22.523
Eight days after his mom dies,

18:22.525 --> 18:25.542
he hands in his resignation
as superintendent,

18:25.544 --> 18:27.961
effective at the end of the month.

18:27.963 --> 18:30.230
So, did his mom dying have
anything to do with him resigning?

18:30.232 --> 18:31.565
You know, it's possible.

18:31.567 --> 18:35.402
With just four days left in
his term would come the event

18:35.404 --> 18:39.006
that would drive him out
of Independence forever.

18:39.008 --> 18:41.341
On August 27th, he's taken hostage

18:41.343 --> 18:46.046
with two of his employees by nine prisoners

18:46.048 --> 18:47.714
and were going to use them as shields

18:47.716 --> 18:48.816
to get out of the prison.

18:48.818 --> 18:50.751
And as they're marching,

18:50.753 --> 18:52.986
seeing that something needed to be done,

18:52.988 --> 18:55.722
Shaw grabs ahold of a fence,

18:55.724 --> 18:58.525
and it breaks the momentum of the escape,

18:58.527 --> 19:01.829
and the guards are able
to shoot at the prisoners.

19:01.831 --> 19:03.413
That's a pretty ballsy move on his part.

19:03.415 --> 19:06.266
It was, and one of the prisoners is killed,

19:06.268 --> 19:09.770
and eight of them escape,
although five are recaptured.

19:09.772 --> 19:11.538
The hostage standoff was big news.

19:11.540 --> 19:14.324
Here's an article about it that
was in the local newspaper.

19:15.544 --> 19:17.427
All right.

19:17.429 --> 19:20.180
So, it sounds like this guy
finally did something right.

19:20.182 --> 19:22.549
The public didn't see it that way.

19:22.551 --> 19:26.119
In this editorial,
they blame him for the escape.

19:26.121 --> 19:27.838
They say that he was too liberal,

19:27.840 --> 19:30.407
that he left the shackles off the prisoners

19:30.409 --> 19:32.493
when he should have left them on,

19:32.495 --> 19:34.711
that he didn't have adequate security.

19:34.713 --> 19:36.597
And after the escape,

19:36.599 --> 19:39.500
he feels like he's a
pariah in the community,

19:39.502 --> 19:41.702
and he sells the property that he has left,

19:41.704 --> 19:43.370
and he moves to California.

19:43.372 --> 19:45.539
Now, how old was he when he died?

19:45.541 --> 19:46.640
He was about 64.

19:46.642 --> 19:47.841
So, what does he die of?

19:47.843 --> 19:48.976
We don't know.

19:48.978 --> 19:50.344
The obituary just says

19:50.346 --> 19:53.046
that he died of an illness
that lasted 13 hours.

19:53.048 --> 19:54.781
Oh. Okay.

19:56.452 --> 19:58.051
Do you know how he died?

19:58.053 --> 20:00.687
It wasn't the way he expected or wanted.

20:00.689 --> 20:04.358
I think he would have liked
to go out in a blaze of glory.

20:07.663 --> 20:10.664
He's really affecting a large area,
you know?

20:10.666 --> 20:13.133
I don't think it's just <i> that</i> house.

20:15.170 --> 20:19.256
I think he does go into homes,

20:19.258 --> 20:21.425
and I think he spies a lot.

20:23.412 --> 20:27.331
He might be attracted to that
negativity of the living.

20:27.333 --> 20:30.517
But I do feel like he has ill intent here.

20:44.805 --> 20:47.539
So far, I know the previous
owner of my clients' property

20:47.541 --> 20:50.909
was run out of town and died
from a mysterious illness.

20:50.911 --> 20:52.411
But I need to see

20:52.413 --> 20:54.446
if there's anything else
that could help my case.

20:56.483 --> 20:57.983
Searching through old records,

20:57.985 --> 21:00.252
I find a deadly fight between two neighbors

21:00.254 --> 21:03.188
right next to Terry and Bobby's property.

21:06.076 --> 21:07.959
I want to know more about this deadly feud,

21:07.961 --> 21:09.878
so I've reached out to
a local police sheriff

21:09.880 --> 21:11.163
to look into it for me,

21:11.165 --> 21:14.099
and he told me that this
was a controversial case

21:14.101 --> 21:16.468
and that it tore the community apart.

21:22.643 --> 21:24.776
Well, Sheriff Wolfe,
thanks for meeting with me

21:24.778 --> 21:26.211
and helping me out with the case.

21:26.213 --> 21:27.879
The reason I got ahold of you is

21:27.881 --> 21:30.449
because of this article I
came across about a homicide

21:30.451 --> 21:32.451
that happened very close to my clients'
property.

21:32.453 --> 21:35.020
This was a neighborhood
feud between two gentlemen,

21:35.022 --> 21:38.256
O.P. Beardsley and T.L. Perryman.

21:38.258 --> 21:43.795
And in 1886,
we ended up with the first violent attack,

21:43.797 --> 21:47.699
and it was Perryman that ended up

21:47.701 --> 21:50.435
attacking Beardsley with a monkey wrench

21:50.437 --> 21:55.240
and caused a pretty
significant gash to him.

21:55.242 --> 22:00.645
And then, in 1888,
Beardsley is walking with a cane,

22:00.647 --> 22:04.416
and Perryman comes across
him and attacks him

22:04.418 --> 22:08.420
and actually breaks several of his ribs,

22:08.422 --> 22:13.258
puts a big gash on his head,
and dislocates an eye.

22:13.260 --> 22:14.559
Now, do we have any idea

22:14.561 --> 22:16.094
what the hell they were
fighting about to begin with?

22:16.096 --> 22:17.846
No one really seems to know.

22:17.848 --> 22:20.699
They just had a real
dislike for each other.

22:20.701 --> 22:23.034
All right, so, now we got this guy Perryman

22:23.036 --> 22:25.303
giving Beardsley two beatings already...

22:25.305 --> 22:26.972
<i>bad</i> beatings, it sounds like.

22:26.974 --> 22:28.006
Yes, very bad.

22:28.008 --> 22:29.341
But, according to the article,

22:29.343 --> 22:31.710
Perryman is the victim of the homicide,

22:31.712 --> 22:33.295
so what happened?

22:33.297 --> 22:36.131
Well, March 14th of 1889...

22:36.133 --> 22:37.149
Okay.

22:37.151 --> 22:39.818
Perryman comes out

22:39.820 --> 22:42.854
and does a staredown with Beardsley,

22:42.856 --> 22:45.857
who is working on a fence
with some other folks.

22:45.859 --> 22:48.059
Thinking he might have
another beating coming,

22:48.061 --> 22:50.228
Beardsley ends up going to the house...

22:50.230 --> 22:51.863
Okay... and he gets a gun.

22:51.865 --> 22:55.500
Beardsley goes back outside,
and Beardsley shoots him.

22:55.502 --> 22:57.636
Just like that? There's no altercation?

22:57.638 --> 22:59.638
Just shoots him in the street.

22:59.640 --> 23:01.056
And, apparently, was shot

23:01.058 --> 23:04.359
once in the heart and once in the back.

23:04.361 --> 23:05.744
Oh, geez. Okay.

23:05.746 --> 23:06.878
So, what happens next?

23:06.880 --> 23:08.964
Oh, he turned himself in to the sheriff.

23:08.966 --> 23:10.365
Did it go to trial?

23:10.367 --> 23:11.416
Yes, it did.

23:11.418 --> 23:13.919
He was found not guilty and acquitted.

23:17.791 --> 23:19.040
How's this guy not guilty

23:19.042 --> 23:21.092
when he shoots a guy down in cold blood?

23:21.094 --> 23:23.595
A jury of his peers must have felt

23:23.597 --> 23:25.530
that he was defending himself.

23:29.736 --> 23:33.738
I'm feeling, like, an impact...

23:33.740 --> 23:34.873
in my back.

23:34.875 --> 23:36.441
Uh...

23:36.443 --> 23:41.413
And it's like a wall,
like something just goes "Boom!"

23:42.282 --> 23:45.183
It was daytime.
It was the middle of the day.

23:45.185 --> 23:49.387
He's probably in his late 30s or early 40s.

23:49.389 --> 23:53.024
And it totally shocks him... like,
totally out of the blue.

23:56.330 --> 23:58.980
Terry mentioned that his
house was physically picked up

23:58.982 --> 24:00.165
and moved at one point.

24:00.167 --> 24:03.401
So I checked into it, and he's right.

24:03.403 --> 24:05.170
It was moved about 18 miles from here.

24:05.172 --> 24:07.439
I've reached out to an old friend of mine,

24:07.441 --> 24:10.158
Jeff Davis, who's an author,
and he said he's got information

24:10.160 --> 24:11.860
that will definitely help my case.

24:18.785 --> 24:20.785
All right, so, this is the property

24:20.787 --> 24:23.388
that the house I'm
investigating was moved from?

24:23.390 --> 24:25.290
Yes, it was built here and then moved

24:25.292 --> 24:28.293
about 17 or 18 miles to
where you first saw it.

24:28.295 --> 24:30.378
You had mentioned on the phone

24:30.380 --> 24:32.814
that the original owner of this land

24:32.816 --> 24:34.432
had an interesting story.

24:34.434 --> 24:36.735
Well, the original landowner
is a man named John Johnson.

24:36.737 --> 24:38.203
And there's his photo.

24:38.205 --> 24:41.606
And he settled here originally in 1845.

24:41.608 --> 24:44.242
And here's his house.

24:44.244 --> 24:46.044
So, what happens to this guy?

24:46.046 --> 24:49.180
He had tragedy after tragedy
for a period of about 15 years.

24:49.182 --> 24:51.933
Within hours of arriving on the property,

24:51.935 --> 24:54.035
his father died of pneumonia.

24:54.037 --> 24:55.954
Okay. So his father dies.

24:55.956 --> 24:57.555
- Yes.
- What else happened?

24:57.557 --> 24:59.057
And then in 1857,

24:59.059 --> 25:03.161
his 5-year-old nephew,
Persis, died of meningitis.

25:03.163 --> 25:07.198
And then three months later,
in January of 1858,

25:07.200 --> 25:09.367
his father-in-law, James Taylor, died,

25:09.369 --> 25:11.102
and he lived right next door.

25:11.104 --> 25:16.007
1865, one of his other nephews,
James, died of diphtheria.

25:16.009 --> 25:17.542
What a horrible death.

25:17.544 --> 25:18.943
- Yeah.
- All right.

25:18.945 --> 25:20.945
So, now he's got all these
family members dying.

25:20.947 --> 25:22.047
Well, that's not all.

25:22.049 --> 25:26.117
On July 9, 1877, it was about 6:00 A.M.,

25:26.119 --> 25:28.853
and his wife called him.

25:28.855 --> 25:30.605
See, she was in the house,

25:30.607 --> 25:32.824
and he was out in the barn, doing chores.

25:32.826 --> 25:33.992
And so he didn't come,

25:33.994 --> 25:36.328
and so she went into the barn to find him,

25:36.330 --> 25:38.096
and that's when she found him

25:38.098 --> 25:39.798
actually hanging from the rafters.

25:41.034 --> 25:42.117
Why? For what reason?

25:42.119 --> 25:44.402
I don't know.
The family didn't know, either.

25:44.404 --> 25:47.005
Okay. So, 1877, he kills himself.

25:47.007 --> 25:48.506
How old is he at this point? He was 61.

25:48.508 --> 25:50.508
Now, let me ask you a question.

25:50.510 --> 25:52.243
Are any of them buried on the property?

25:52.245 --> 25:54.112
They're <i> all</i> buried here.

26:01.221 --> 26:03.588
Definitely a broken neck.

26:03.590 --> 26:05.757
Oh, this is bad.

26:05.759 --> 26:08.193
This is not done well.

26:13.233 --> 26:14.999
It's a male... old.

26:15.001 --> 26:16.201
Uh...

26:16.203 --> 26:18.903
I'd say he's, like, in his 60s.

26:18.905 --> 26:20.872
He's white.

26:20.874 --> 26:23.375
I think... I don't know...
it might have been an accident.

26:23.377 --> 26:25.994
An accidental hanging?

26:28.648 --> 26:31.015
Um...

26:31.017 --> 26:34.152
Because it's so badly done.

26:41.528 --> 26:44.062
I saw several entities during my walk,

26:44.064 --> 26:47.682
but the group of tricksters
surrounding a living person

26:47.684 --> 26:49.334
had me the most concerned.

26:49.336 --> 26:53.905
They were probably about 3 or 4 feet tall.

26:53.907 --> 26:58.760
They had large heads, they're pitch-black,

26:58.762 --> 27:01.813
and they were all around the bed,
staring at the person.

27:06.319 --> 27:07.752
Is this what you saw?

27:07.754 --> 27:09.888
Yes, this is what I saw.

27:29.793 --> 27:32.427
Now that Amy and I have
completed our investigations,

27:32.429 --> 27:34.062
we're ready to reveal our findings

27:34.064 --> 27:37.266
to each other and our
clients for the first time.

27:37.268 --> 27:39.301
Amy, I'd like you to meet Terry,

27:39.303 --> 27:40.953
and this is his partner, Bobby.

27:40.955 --> 27:46.842
They live here with Terry's
7- year-old grandson, Ashton.

27:46.844 --> 27:47.843
Okay.

27:47.845 --> 27:50.312
Now, we've been doing investigations

27:50.314 --> 27:52.648
for quite a time now, but these guys have

27:52.650 --> 27:54.716
some of the wildest
stories I've ever heard.

27:54.718 --> 27:57.219
They called us in
'cause they can't take it anymore.

27:57.221 --> 27:59.621
It's affecting their relationship,
Terry's health,

27:59.623 --> 28:01.890
and, most importantly,
it's affecting Ashton.

28:05.446 --> 28:06.995
How long have you lived here?

28:06.997 --> 28:08.931
About four years.

28:08.933 --> 28:11.433
Four years. When did the activity start?

28:11.435 --> 28:13.168
When we moved in.

28:15.172 --> 28:18.440
This was a very unusual walk.

28:18.442 --> 28:22.311
I've actually never encountered
anything quite like this.

28:22.313 --> 28:25.280
When I went into the house,

28:25.282 --> 28:28.584
I actually couldn't trust
anything I was seeing,

28:28.586 --> 28:33.305
anything I was hearing,
anything I was feeling.

28:33.307 --> 28:37.109
It was insane, really. It was insane.

28:39.463 --> 28:41.513
I'm gonna back up, though,

28:41.515 --> 28:45.434
and I'm gonna talk about
what I got outside first.

28:45.436 --> 28:47.686
I walked up the driveway,

28:47.688 --> 28:53.959
and there was this older man...
probably in his 60s.

28:53.961 --> 28:56.678
He was outside,
and he was getting down from something,

28:56.680 --> 28:59.548
and he hung himself.

29:00.985 --> 29:06.555
But it was horribly done
and extremely painful.

29:06.557 --> 29:11.293
I can't believe she actually
saw something like this,

29:11.295 --> 29:12.628
because it didn't happen <i> here.</i>

29:12.630 --> 29:16.164
Their house was actually moved here... Oh.

29:16.166 --> 29:17.799
From about 18 miles away.

29:17.801 --> 29:18.967
Okay.

29:18.969 --> 29:22.137
This guy John Johnson lived on the property

29:22.139 --> 29:24.539
that the house came from.

29:24.541 --> 29:26.241
This is the farmland where he lived.

29:27.861 --> 29:29.778
Settled in 1851.

29:29.780 --> 29:32.881
Now, this guy had bad luck
from the minute he got there.

29:32.883 --> 29:34.549
His father died of pneumonia

29:34.551 --> 29:36.118
within hours of getting to the property,

29:36.120 --> 29:38.887
and then he lost a nephew,
his father-in-law,

29:38.889 --> 29:40.105
then another nephew.

29:40.107 --> 29:45.327
So, on July 9, 1877,
he goes out into the barn.

29:45.329 --> 29:49.865
His wife goes to find
him, and he's hanging.

29:49.867 --> 29:51.233
He committed suicide.

29:53.537 --> 29:55.871
So, the guy you saw,
you said, was in his 60s.

29:55.873 --> 29:57.973
This guy Johnson died at the age of 61.

29:59.376 --> 30:02.077
Now, I was able to locate a photo of him.

30:04.581 --> 30:07.716
Oh, my.

30:12.256 --> 30:13.555
What's the matter?

30:13.557 --> 30:15.590
I've seen him.

30:15.592 --> 30:19.394
That's the old man from the hallway.

30:19.396 --> 30:22.998
I was in my house one day,

30:23.000 --> 30:26.201
and I just happened to
glance up in the mirror,

30:26.203 --> 30:27.436
and behind me...

30:28.439 --> 30:31.606
It looked just like him.

30:31.608 --> 30:34.910
And it looked like he was coming after me.

30:34.912 --> 30:37.946
I ran down the hallway and
slammed the door behind me,

30:37.948 --> 30:39.314
it scared me so bad.

30:40.801 --> 30:42.718
Does this guy look familiar to you at all?

30:42.720 --> 30:45.187
Oh, yeah.

30:45.189 --> 30:46.488
I'm a little creeped out

30:46.490 --> 30:48.857
knowing that he came from another property.

30:48.859 --> 30:52.094
I didn't even think anything
like that could be possible.

30:52.096 --> 30:53.261
Yes, it is.

30:53.263 --> 30:56.631
The dead can form all sorts of attachments.

30:56.633 --> 30:57.899
Wow.

31:02.740 --> 31:05.073
When I went into the house,

31:05.075 --> 31:08.944
the first thing that I
saw was this living male.

31:10.114 --> 31:14.116
And he seemed very angry and upset,

31:14.118 --> 31:18.887
and he was kind of yelling and screaming,
very emotional,

31:18.889 --> 31:24.192
and I saw that he had brown
hair and he was in his 40s.

31:26.563 --> 31:28.029
It's me.

31:30.651 --> 31:34.169
Yeah, I'm kind of confrontational
with the ghosts.

31:34.171 --> 31:37.773
When I can't get any sleep,
I get up and I yell at them.

31:37.775 --> 31:40.208
Okay.

31:40.210 --> 31:44.446
The other thing that I got...

31:47.251 --> 31:51.486
There is somebody at the
location with abilities.

31:53.307 --> 31:56.091
And their dominant ability is telepathy.

31:57.394 --> 32:01.663
The telepath can manipulate
the minds of those around them

32:01.665 --> 32:05.700
into perceiving what they're perceiving.

32:05.702 --> 32:08.804
So,
there's only two guys living in this place.

32:08.806 --> 32:10.388
Which one of these two is the telepath?

32:13.644 --> 32:16.378
Well, right away, when I sat down...

32:16.380 --> 32:20.248
and you know I did not know their names...

32:20.250 --> 32:22.300
I wrote this down. Oh, geez. Look at that.

32:22.302 --> 32:23.251
Yeah.

32:23.253 --> 32:24.786
She put your first initial down.

32:30.060 --> 32:31.626
Wow.

32:31.628 --> 32:36.448
I've always kind of felt
like maybe I was sensitive

32:36.450 --> 32:38.600
or had some weird type of power.

32:38.602 --> 32:42.370
I would say my moods are contagious.

32:44.575 --> 32:46.541
Sure explains a lot, don't it?

32:48.412 --> 32:50.445
It makes sense.

32:53.417 --> 32:57.752
We also have these other
things that are here,

32:57.754 --> 33:01.923
and what I'll call them is the tricksters.

33:03.260 --> 33:05.877
Typically, a trickster is associated

33:05.879 --> 33:08.396
with Native American tribes,
but they're all over the world.

33:08.398 --> 33:10.699
But that's not what's going on here.

33:10.701 --> 33:12.901
This is where it gets very unusual.

33:12.903 --> 33:15.370
There's about 50 of them.

33:17.140 --> 33:22.844
These guys are causing all kinds of chaos.

33:22.846 --> 33:26.982
They like to feed off of
negative environments.

33:28.886 --> 33:31.086
They're about like 3 or 4 feet tall,

33:31.088 --> 33:33.922
shiny... very shiny... black,
like, glistening.

33:35.158 --> 33:37.158
Well, they've seen them.

33:37.160 --> 33:40.061
One of the many things that
these guys experience here.

33:40.063 --> 33:40.896
Yeah.

33:43.133 --> 33:44.966
I had an experience...

33:44.968 --> 33:47.369
three of them at the foot of my bed.

33:47.371 --> 33:48.503
Oh, yes.

33:48.505 --> 33:50.755
I jumped out of the bed,
I ran through them,

33:50.757 --> 33:52.741
and got out into the hallway.

33:52.743 --> 33:56.778
I am awakened every night by these things.

33:56.780 --> 33:58.680
Wow. Okay.

33:58.682 --> 34:02.984
The thing about the bed is,
when I was in that middle room,

34:02.986 --> 34:05.554
I actually did see them getting
and having a good time...

34:05.556 --> 34:07.472
That's where I always see them.

34:07.474 --> 34:10.507
And jumping on the bed,
and they were having a blast.

34:12.062 --> 34:15.362
Here, they're more aggressive.

34:15.364 --> 34:17.498
They're, like, jumping on the bed

34:17.501 --> 34:20.150
like they're having a good time,

34:20.152 --> 34:22.370
barking and growling.

34:23.639 --> 34:26.808
And that's where Ashton sleeps.

34:28.295 --> 34:30.946
One night, I heard him scream
in the middle of the night,

34:30.947 --> 34:32.581
and he came running out, and he swore

34:32.583 --> 34:35.116
there was red eyes in the
closet staring right at him,

34:35.118 --> 34:36.868
that they were coming at him.

34:38.388 --> 34:40.655
He's scared to death.

34:40.657 --> 34:44.775
These things can manipulate what you see,

34:44.777 --> 34:48.897
and, you know, most often,

34:48.899 --> 34:52.766
they'll actually appear as
animals and things like that.

34:52.768 --> 34:54.768
Tell her.

34:56.005 --> 34:57.672
I was laying in bed one night,

34:57.674 --> 35:00.258
and I saw a little fawn
actually hop through the window,

35:00.260 --> 35:01.977
and it hopped in front of the bed

35:01.979 --> 35:03.979
and then just booked it down the hallway.

35:03.981 --> 35:05.447
Okay.

35:06.650 --> 35:08.149
It's really bad.

35:16.994 --> 35:18.793
The other thing was,

35:18.795 --> 35:24.532
these guys are going to draw
from you any kind of negativity

35:24.534 --> 35:27.419
because that's gonna feed them,

35:27.421 --> 35:31.673
so these things will bring up
these done and over issues,

35:31.675 --> 35:33.842
like past traumas

35:33.844 --> 35:36.111
or bad things that have
happened in a person's life.

35:36.113 --> 35:38.029
They'll, like, trigger that,

35:38.031 --> 35:40.281
and then you're thinking
about it and thinking about it

35:40.283 --> 35:41.750
and talking about it and talking about it,

35:41.752 --> 35:43.568
and it's just feeding it and feeding it.

35:43.570 --> 35:44.953
Do you know what I'm saying?

35:48.659 --> 35:50.492
I think
about that all the time.

35:51.895 --> 35:54.346
I don't tell anybody that.

35:59.770 --> 36:03.204
It just makes you feel like no
matter how much good you do,

36:03.206 --> 36:04.489
you'll never make up

36:04.491 --> 36:07.475
for every bad thing you've
ever done in your life.

36:09.813 --> 36:13.865
But when I'm <i>not</i> here,
I never think it.

36:15.669 --> 36:18.787
Sometimes I stay long at
school so I don't have to.

36:21.958 --> 36:23.391
He thinks I don't want to come home.

36:23.393 --> 36:25.126
I don't want to...

36:25.128 --> 36:28.096
I want something to think
about that's different.

36:30.367 --> 36:32.167
I told <i>nobody</i> about that.

36:35.172 --> 36:36.588
I'm sorry.

36:41.311 --> 36:43.111
So, everything she's saying

36:43.113 --> 36:45.613
is making sense to both of you guys?

36:46.917 --> 36:50.051
So, I did have a sketch done

36:50.053 --> 36:52.454
of what I saw in the master bedroom.

36:58.061 --> 36:59.060
Ooh.

37:08.739 --> 37:12.540
Oh, my God.

37:25.858 --> 37:28.258
So, I did have a sketch done

37:28.260 --> 37:30.861
of what I saw in the master bedroom.

37:34.600 --> 37:35.599
Ooh.

37:42.141 --> 37:46.059
Oh, my God.

37:54.370 --> 37:56.804
And this <i>is</i> where I see them,

37:56.806 --> 37:59.756
is around the bottom corner of my bed.

37:59.758 --> 38:02.626
No wonder I'm not getting any sleep.

38:02.628 --> 38:05.112
Are they, like, physically capable

38:05.114 --> 38:07.014
of pulling the covers off of me?

38:07.016 --> 38:07.865
Yes.

38:08.767 --> 38:10.634
Oh, no.

38:10.636 --> 38:14.104
These tricksters have a leader.

38:14.106 --> 38:17.274
I saw him outside.

38:17.276 --> 38:20.911
When he was alive,
he was a very strong, powerful man,

38:20.913 --> 38:26.450
and he did have a lot of
power placed upon him.

38:27.887 --> 38:29.653
He was in charge of a lot of people.

38:29.655 --> 38:33.223
He was from probably, I think,
about 80 to 100 years ago.

38:33.225 --> 38:37.327
He was extremely pissed
off about the way he died

38:37.329 --> 38:39.596
because he didn't want to die that way.

38:39.598 --> 38:41.565
He should have died, like,
in a blaze of glory.

38:41.567 --> 38:43.066
Okay, so, this guy was powerful

38:43.068 --> 38:44.868
and was in charge of a lot of people?

38:44.870 --> 38:46.370
Yes.

38:46.372 --> 38:48.639
So, the original owner of
the property you're on now

38:48.641 --> 38:50.440
was this guy Alva Shaw.

38:50.442 --> 38:51.692
He was very well-connected.

38:51.694 --> 38:53.694
Matter of fact, he was so well-connected,

38:53.696 --> 38:56.813
he was appointed by the governor in 1864

38:56.815 --> 39:00.317
to be the superintendent of the
state penitentiary in Portland.

39:00.319 --> 39:02.085
Problem was, he wasn't good at it.

39:02.087 --> 39:03.670
When he was running the penitentiary,

39:03.672 --> 39:04.688
44 prisoners escaped.

39:05.691 --> 39:07.858
Only 13 were ever recaptured.

39:07.860 --> 39:11.828
So, on August 27, 1866,

39:11.830 --> 39:13.463
eight prisoners take him hostage.

39:13.465 --> 39:17.100
He was able to break away,
but a bunch of them escaped.

39:17.102 --> 39:18.602
Only five were recaptured.

39:18.604 --> 39:19.970
The next morning,

39:19.972 --> 39:22.573
he wakes up to an editorial
calling him a disgrace

39:22.575 --> 39:25.042
and that he doesn't know
how to run a prison

39:25.044 --> 39:28.562
and he caused this whole thing to happen.

39:28.564 --> 39:33.016
Now, this is him at a younger age.

39:33.018 --> 39:35.052
Now, he died in 1880 at the age of 64

39:35.054 --> 39:37.554
after a 13-hour illness.

39:37.556 --> 39:38.789
He just died.

39:38.791 --> 39:41.275
So, he didn't definitely
go out in a blaze of glory.

39:41.277 --> 39:42.426
That's for sure.

39:42.428 --> 39:44.428
I don't know if this is the person or not.

39:44.430 --> 39:45.963
I really don't.

39:48.133 --> 39:50.067
This is so overwhelming.

39:50.069 --> 39:52.469
I never expected this much.

39:52.471 --> 39:55.539
I mean, I knew there was a lot going on,
but wow.

40:01.512 --> 40:04.146
So, guys, you know why
you've been fighting.

40:04.148 --> 40:06.682
You know why your moods have been changing.

40:06.684 --> 40:09.018
You know why you're
hearing and seeing things.

40:09.020 --> 40:10.486
But the big question is,

40:10.488 --> 40:13.189
are you gonna be able to raise
Ashton here in a safe place?

40:13.191 --> 40:15.758
For that answer,
I'm gonna turn it over to Amy.

40:18.697 --> 40:21.397
A lot of things have to be
attacked at the same time

40:21.399 --> 40:24.000
to get a good, good result.

40:24.002 --> 40:26.736
So, the first thing is the dead guy,
the leader...

40:26.738 --> 40:28.938
He needs to go.

40:28.940 --> 40:31.774
So, what I would like
to see happen with him

40:31.776 --> 40:35.228
is a physical medium to come in,
talk to him,

40:35.230 --> 40:36.980
and get him to leave.

40:36.982 --> 40:39.816
But, at the same time,

40:39.818 --> 40:42.986
you also need to have a shaman come in,

40:42.988 --> 40:46.055
and what I want that person to do

40:46.057 --> 40:48.925
is to set up a perimeter
around your property,

40:48.927 --> 40:50.593
and I mean big.

40:50.595 --> 40:52.962
Like, all the way around, okay?

40:52.964 --> 40:56.215
This is gonna push these tricksters out.

40:56.217 --> 40:58.468
So, once that's done,

40:58.470 --> 41:00.737
you have to deal with your abilities.

41:00.739 --> 41:02.722
Start keeping a daily journal.

41:02.724 --> 41:06.175
And what I want you to do is
to write up any and all issues

41:06.177 --> 41:08.645
that create strong emotions within you.

41:08.647 --> 41:10.546
Once a week,
I want you to take all those pages

41:10.548 --> 41:12.715
that you've written all this stuff in

41:12.717 --> 41:16.019
and burn it and just get rid of that.

41:16.021 --> 41:18.655
Put it away and out from you.

41:20.258 --> 41:22.191
Now, I spoke to Ashton. He's 7 years old.

41:22.193 --> 41:24.227
He really doesn't understand
what's going on here,

41:24.229 --> 41:25.561
but he's scared.

41:25.563 --> 41:27.730
How long do you think before
he'll maybe feel better

41:27.732 --> 41:28.798
about things in the house?

41:28.800 --> 41:32.352
He'll feel a lot better

41:32.354 --> 41:35.722
once the shaman's moved
all of the tricksters

41:35.724 --> 41:37.106
off the property.

41:39.144 --> 41:40.910
So, are you guys gonna take Amy's advice?

41:40.912 --> 41:42.545
Every step of the way.

41:42.547 --> 41:43.963
We're gonna get it taken care of.

41:43.965 --> 41:45.214
I want them out of my house.

41:45.216 --> 41:46.549
Now it's payback.

41:46.551 --> 41:49.852
They're gonna pay.

41:49.854 --> 41:51.287
They're gonna go.

41:51.289 --> 41:55.425
I really hope Terry
and Bobby follow my advice

41:55.427 --> 41:59.762
and deal with the tricksters
terrorizing their family.

41:59.764 --> 42:01.631
With the help of a medium and a shaman,

42:01.633 --> 42:03.900
they should be able to
free themselves of the evil

42:03.902 --> 42:05.568
surrounding their home.
