WEBVTT

00:04.822 --> 00:08.173
Tower, this is Alpha Foxtrot
Two Zero Four.

00:08.259 --> 00:10.292
Completing perimeter. All clear.

00:10.344 --> 00:13.262
Copy, Alpha Foxtrot,
proceed to NAS 160.

00:13.330 --> 00:14.930
Copy. On approach to NAS 160.

00:16.600 --> 00:19.134
Tower, I have a bogey on radar.

00:19.186 --> 00:20.969
Five miles out at seven zero.

00:21.022 --> 00:22.938
Tower, can you identify?

00:23.006 --> 00:24.339
We have a flight plan

00:24.392 --> 00:26.358
for tail sign
November 101 Delta Sierra.

00:26.444 --> 00:28.193
Negative.
This is not an aircraft.

00:28.279 --> 00:31.196
It's nondirectional movement.
I'll go check it out.

00:32.700 --> 00:34.149
Any chance this is

00:34.201 --> 00:36.035
one of those ladybug clouds
over the Gulf?

00:36.120 --> 00:37.536
No idea, Frost.

00:39.240 --> 00:41.290
November 101, this is Navy.

00:41.358 --> 00:43.125
Do you copy?

00:43.193 --> 00:44.993
Navy. I am...

00:45.046 --> 00:48.630
November 101, can you tell me
what is happening?

00:54.922 --> 00:56.538
Mayday, Mayday.

00:56.590 --> 00:58.140
I have an aircraft in distress.

00:58.208 --> 00:59.808
Repeat, I have
an aircraft in distress,

00:59.877 --> 01:01.477
headed towards the water.

01:03.000 --> 01:09.074

contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:53.481 --> 01:55.697
Put your hands
where I can see 'em!

01:57.284 --> 01:59.535
Now!

02:19.807 --> 02:21.089
No.

02:21.142 --> 02:22.925
No.

02:22.977 --> 02:24.176
No!

02:26.180 --> 02:27.629
No!

02:41.328 --> 02:43.495
I'm really happy Pride's back,
but you being demoted sucks.

02:43.581 --> 02:46.582
Even he thinks it sucks.

02:46.650 --> 02:49.985
Can I get you a box for that?
No. No.

02:50.037 --> 02:52.955
Probably way out of line here.
My feelings aren't important.

02:53.007 --> 02:55.007
If you're okay, I'm okay.

02:56.326 --> 02:58.293
I'm not okay.

02:59.713 --> 03:01.162
I'm pissed. Good.

03:01.215 --> 03:03.265
I'm glad we're on the same page.

03:05.936 --> 03:08.303
I'm not mad at Pride.
It's not his fault.

03:08.355 --> 03:10.105
I'm mad at all these men
sitting in their offices,

03:10.173 --> 03:12.808
looking at our work
through a different prism

03:12.860 --> 03:14.643
than our male colleagues.

03:14.695 --> 03:16.144
I hear you.

03:16.197 --> 03:18.530
I wanted to tell them
to take this job

03:18.616 --> 03:21.200
and shove it so far up the
dark recesses of their...

03:23.020 --> 03:27.155
big offices, and get the hell
out of here, but...

03:29.793 --> 03:32.160
Naomi needs me to stay, so,

03:32.213 --> 03:34.696
I will, and eventually, I'm just
gonna stop thinking about it.

03:34.748 --> 03:37.365
You can't just stay
for Naomi, Hannah.

03:37.418 --> 03:39.167
Yeah, I can.

03:39.220 --> 03:41.202
If that's what she needs. I
mean, what's best for her

03:41.255 --> 03:43.672
can also be what's best for you.

03:43.724 --> 03:46.008
You got to figure out
how to make a life here.

03:46.060 --> 03:47.342
You can't just be
focused on this job.

03:47.394 --> 03:49.344
It's not good for you. You...

03:54.568 --> 03:56.568
You don't have to do that.

03:56.654 --> 03:58.020
I know.

04:04.578 --> 04:06.028
Hey, y'all.

04:06.080 --> 04:09.698
- Hey.
- We got, donuts.

04:09.750 --> 04:13.535
Yeah, thanks. Look, I got a call
from, Belle Chasse.

04:13.587 --> 04:15.837
A, civilian aircraft

04:15.906 --> 04:19.591
registered to Paradiso
Technologies, crashed

04:19.677 --> 04:21.843
in the Gulf,

04:21.911 --> 04:23.795
and the Navy is concerned
that their pilot...

04:25.248 --> 04:27.415
Lieutenant Ella Meyer

04:27.468 --> 04:29.017
got too close, and her wake

04:29.086 --> 04:30.519
brought the plane down.

04:30.587 --> 04:32.771
Isn't that an NTSB issue?

04:32.856 --> 04:35.090
Should be, except the lieutenant

04:35.142 --> 04:38.226
says that she saw something
that she can't explain.

04:38.279 --> 04:39.394
Hold on one second.

04:39.446 --> 04:40.929
Is "can't explain" code for...

04:40.981 --> 04:43.065
Nope. 'Cause there's been a
lot of sightings recently.

04:43.117 --> 04:44.449
No. How do you even know
what I'm gonna say?

04:44.535 --> 04:45.784
You're gonna say "aliens."

04:47.538 --> 04:49.437
Well, we should go,
we should go talk to her.

04:49.490 --> 04:51.373
We should.

04:51.441 --> 04:53.608
And the Coast Guard
recovered the plane.

04:53.661 --> 04:55.110
It'll be on the dock any minute.

04:55.162 --> 04:56.411
Well, if she saw something,

04:56.463 --> 04:58.914
it should be on radar, right?

04:58.966 --> 05:00.382
Yeah. Patton's already got
the download.

05:00.450 --> 05:03.051
So... um...

05:07.057 --> 05:09.558
Tammy and I will
go talk to the pilot?

05:09.626 --> 05:11.810
And Sebastian and I
will check out

05:11.895 --> 05:14.596
the plane, get the body to Wade?

05:14.648 --> 05:16.064
I've got radar.

05:16.133 --> 05:17.983
Okay. Okay, good.

05:23.357 --> 05:26.108
I can't believe anyone thinks
I brought that plane down.

05:26.160 --> 05:27.492
I had nothing to do with it.

05:27.578 --> 05:28.944
We don't think anything,
Lieutenant.

05:28.996 --> 05:30.329
We are just investigating.

05:30.414 --> 05:33.148
You said you saw a "UFO"?

05:33.200 --> 05:36.585
Yes. Just that,
an unidentified flying object.

05:36.653 --> 05:38.920
Something that
I-I couldn't identify.

05:38.989 --> 05:41.322
I bet got a lot of traction
in the ready room?

05:41.375 --> 05:43.008
After all the hours
that I've put in,

05:43.093 --> 05:45.326
and all the crap I've had
to put up with to get here,

05:45.379 --> 05:47.295
the bunch of them just act
like I reported E.T.

05:47.348 --> 05:49.264
So, this object,
what did it look like?

05:49.332 --> 05:54.436
It was late,
but the moon was out and...

05:54.504 --> 05:56.972
I could see this-this contrast

05:57.024 --> 05:58.857
on the white aircraft,
it was like

05:58.942 --> 06:00.675
some sort of a dark mass.

06:00.728 --> 06:01.977
Smoke, maybe?

06:02.029 --> 06:03.014
There was no smoke

06:03.030 --> 06:04.095
that would indicate
an engine fire,

06:04.114 --> 06:05.697
and a-at the speed it was going,

06:05.783 --> 06:08.150
you would have assumed
that smoke would be trailing.

06:08.202 --> 06:10.035
What was this mass doing?

06:11.071 --> 06:12.704
Undulating.

06:12.790 --> 06:15.791
Like a glob in a lava lamp?

06:16.860 --> 06:18.526
Sort of.

06:18.579 --> 06:20.379
Except, right before
the plane went down,

06:20.464 --> 06:21.863
it-it backed up,

06:21.915 --> 06:25.050
like it was, like it was
looking at the plane.

06:25.135 --> 06:27.002
A-And then it moved in again.

06:27.054 --> 06:30.222
Wait, so are you saying that
this thing attacked the plane?

06:30.307 --> 06:33.392
I'm saying
that I saw something that,

06:33.477 --> 06:35.677
that I can't
quite make sense of.

06:35.729 --> 06:38.063
Okay? And therefore,
I can't identify it.

06:38.148 --> 06:42.050
Something happen recently that
may have detached your retina?

06:42.102 --> 06:44.186
Excuse me? A detached retina

06:44.238 --> 06:45.654
can cause shadow.

06:45.722 --> 06:47.689
A plane fell out of the sky.

06:47.741 --> 06:49.574
And it may not have had anything
to do with what you saw.

06:49.660 --> 06:51.226
Coincidence isn't causation.

06:51.278 --> 06:54.663
No, ma'am. No detached retina.

06:54.731 --> 06:56.698
Okay. Look, somebody died,

06:56.750 --> 06:58.533
and I'm-I'm very sorry for that,

06:58.585 --> 07:01.420
but my wake did not
bring that plane down.

07:01.505 --> 07:02.671
And the longer the Navy thinks

07:02.739 --> 07:03.905
it might have, and
my fellow pilots

07:03.957 --> 07:05.424
continue to make fun of me

07:05.509 --> 07:08.409
for a completely
legitimate report,

07:08.462 --> 07:10.411
the worse this is for my career.

07:10.464 --> 07:12.714
We know.

07:12.766 --> 07:14.549
I promise, Lieutenant Meyer,

07:14.601 --> 07:16.184
we are as committed
to solving this case

07:16.253 --> 07:18.186
as any two investigators
could be.

07:22.425 --> 07:23.942
Bruh.

07:24.027 --> 07:27.279
I haven't figured out what
this radar cloud is yet.

07:27.364 --> 07:29.430
I just know it's not
weather, ladybugs

07:29.483 --> 07:31.032
or aliens.

07:31.101 --> 07:33.401
And, frankly, I'm least sure
about the last one.

07:33.454 --> 07:34.569
Okay.

07:34.621 --> 07:35.954
Okay?

07:36.039 --> 07:37.906
Yeah. Because, usually,

07:37.958 --> 07:39.774
y'all want me to figure out
everything by yesterday.

07:39.827 --> 07:43.128
Well, it sounds like you're
doing everything you can do.

07:43.213 --> 07:45.080
You okay?

07:47.468 --> 07:50.418
The counselor where
my brother lives called.

07:50.471 --> 07:53.972
Said Cade's missed
the last two nightly check-ins.

07:54.057 --> 07:56.475
You call him? Didn't answer.

07:56.560 --> 07:58.793
I'm guessing he...

07:58.846 --> 08:00.428
went off his medication

08:00.481 --> 08:02.397
and is cycling through
a manic phase.

08:02.465 --> 08:03.982
I can ping his phone.

08:04.067 --> 08:05.901
Could you?

08:05.969 --> 08:06.985
I'm tail up, stinger out.

08:09.156 --> 08:12.274
I need to find him before
he does something really stupid,

08:12.326 --> 08:13.658
as opposed to
garden-variety stupid

08:13.744 --> 08:16.695
like going off his medication.

08:18.081 --> 08:20.081
Looks like your brother's phone

08:20.150 --> 08:21.482
is off the grid.

08:21.535 --> 08:23.034
Could just be a dead battery.

08:24.705 --> 08:26.955
Yeah, let's hope.

08:33.996 --> 08:36.847
Pretty clear NTSB
is gonna try and pin this

08:36.933 --> 08:38.683
- on our Navy pilot.
- Well, given the fact

08:38.769 --> 08:40.434
that the plane and the body
just arrived at the docks,

08:40.503 --> 08:43.355
that seems like a less
than rigorous investigation.

08:43.440 --> 08:46.507
He said he "glanced
at the plane" en route.

08:46.560 --> 08:48.276
All right. Well,
as long as he gave it his all.

08:48.345 --> 08:50.678
They'll wait for the autopsy,

08:50.731 --> 08:54.032
see if he was
incapacitated in-flight.

08:54.117 --> 08:57.118
But he's logged 1,500 hours,

08:57.187 --> 08:58.519
and family says
he's made this trip

08:58.572 --> 09:02.207
back-and-forth to Mexico
all the time.

09:02.292 --> 09:04.209
Well, at the altitude
he was flying,

09:04.294 --> 09:06.361
shouldn't an experienced pilot
be able to overcome turbulence,

09:06.413 --> 09:08.363
even in the wake
of a fighter jet?

09:08.415 --> 09:09.497
Yeah, I'd hope so.

09:09.550 --> 09:11.032
That Navy pilot shot herself
in the foot

09:11.084 --> 09:14.169
when she wrote "UFO"
on her report.

09:16.390 --> 09:18.006
Pride? Yeah?

09:24.431 --> 09:25.847
Just found this in the engine.

09:25.899 --> 09:27.599
Found what?

09:31.054 --> 09:33.154
What the hell is that?

09:33.223 --> 09:34.555
Some kind of metal
I've never seen before.

09:34.608 --> 09:36.741
It's almost invisible.

09:36.827 --> 09:38.059
It's like something
a-a spaceship would use

09:38.111 --> 09:39.828
so we couldn't detect it.

09:40.781 --> 09:43.331
I'm not saying aliens.

09:43.400 --> 09:45.200
I'm also not <i> not</i> saying aliens.

09:57.623 --> 09:59.673
You look like the dog ate
your birthday cake.

09:59.741 --> 10:03.760
It's this piece of metal
I found in the plane engine.

10:03.846 --> 10:07.080
It's, an advanced
form of tungsten carbide.

10:07.132 --> 10:08.915
It's designed to be invisible.

10:08.968 --> 10:10.917
It's expensive,
it's amazing, but...

10:10.970 --> 10:14.188
But it's not gonna get you
on the cover of <i> Nerd's Today.</i>

10:14.256 --> 10:16.590
No. How'd it get in the engine?

10:16.642 --> 10:18.358
- I don't know.
- Our Navy pilot

10:18.427 --> 10:20.093
is certain she saw
some sort of attack.

10:20.145 --> 10:21.195
Well, let's assume

10:21.263 --> 10:23.363
we can figure out the what. Why?

10:23.432 --> 10:24.948
Our pilot, Andrew Pruitt,

10:25.034 --> 10:26.950
founder and genius
of Paradiso Technologies.

10:29.321 --> 10:32.105
The company has developed and
sold a bunch of technologies.

10:32.157 --> 10:35.459
But when Pruitt's wife died ten
years ago, he started focusing

10:35.544 --> 10:38.128
on computational software
for drug testing.

10:38.214 --> 10:40.747
He gave it away to any drug
company he thought needed it.

10:40.799 --> 10:42.616
Well, that's two months ago.

10:42.668 --> 10:45.118
She's not the late Mrs. Pruitt?
Wife number two.

10:45.170 --> 10:47.754
She was CFO of the company
when they met.

10:47.806 --> 10:50.490
Now she's CEO. Hannah and I
are gonna go and talk to her

10:50.559 --> 10:52.976
and the rest of the family
at Paradiso offices.

10:53.062 --> 10:54.595
Hi, Pride. Hey.

10:54.663 --> 10:56.480
Bye, Pride.

10:56.565 --> 10:58.131
I guess I'll try to figure out

10:58.183 --> 10:59.299
where this thing came from.

10:59.351 --> 11:00.317
I'll go with you.

11:00.402 --> 11:01.768
Patton can assist.

11:01.820 --> 11:04.104
Is this one of
those moments where,

11:04.156 --> 11:05.522
you want me to go, but...

11:06.642 --> 11:08.025
Okay, I'm gonna go.

11:11.030 --> 11:12.996
You should go look for Cade.

11:13.082 --> 11:14.248
Patton told you.

11:14.316 --> 11:15.815
He knew you wouldn't.

11:15.868 --> 11:18.318
Well, Cade's been
off his meds before.

11:18.370 --> 11:20.504
But in the last few years,
he's been fine, right?

11:20.589 --> 11:21.855
Yeah.

11:21.924 --> 11:24.625
And I was hoping
this sort of thing

11:24.677 --> 11:26.927
was behind us.

11:26.995 --> 11:29.796
And I'm gonna keep hoping
that that's the case.

11:29.848 --> 11:32.799
But the trouble with
being bipolar is that

11:32.851 --> 11:36.186
if folks do okay long enough,

11:36.272 --> 11:38.972
they may start to think
they're actually okay.

11:40.526 --> 11:42.693
You should go to Alabama.

11:42.778 --> 11:44.144
He might need you.

11:44.196 --> 11:46.780
We've got a case.

11:46.848 --> 11:48.899
I can order you to go.

11:51.687 --> 11:55.289
Thanks, King. I'll be back soon.

12:01.530 --> 12:05.165
Having no examination
whatsoever, I would say

12:05.217 --> 12:08.502
that the trauma on his body
is consistent with

12:08.554 --> 12:10.470
a high-impact crash.

12:10.539 --> 12:12.222
You think that's too much
bruising for him

12:12.308 --> 12:14.040
to have died in the air? I do.

12:14.093 --> 12:16.876
Which means he was alive
at the moment of impact.

12:16.929 --> 12:18.712
And it doesn't rule out
any sort of

12:18.764 --> 12:20.514
cardiac event.

12:20.566 --> 12:23.383
But we won't know
until I open him up.

12:23.435 --> 12:24.985
What else
is on your mind, Dwayne?

12:25.053 --> 12:26.653
Am I that transparent?

12:26.722 --> 12:28.071
We've been friends a long time.

12:28.157 --> 12:30.574
You still having those
unsettling dreams?

12:30.659 --> 12:33.577
Yeah.

12:33.662 --> 12:36.446
Though I guess "nightmares"
is a better word.

12:37.783 --> 12:40.734
A man in a red suit

12:40.786 --> 12:44.237
keeps... showing up.

12:44.289 --> 12:46.423
Never where he's supposed to be.

12:46.508 --> 12:49.092
I try to get to him,
but I can't.

12:49.178 --> 12:52.095
And then last night, he...
he led me to someone

12:52.181 --> 12:53.913
I hadn't thought about in years.

12:53.966 --> 12:54.941
Who?

12:54.967 --> 12:57.017
A little girl who died

12:57.085 --> 12:59.353
in a hostage situation

12:59.421 --> 13:01.355
when I was a young sheriff.

13:01.423 --> 13:05.025
How long has it been since you
had a restful night's sleep?

13:06.094 --> 13:08.762
Not long. Couple of weeks.

13:08.814 --> 13:11.031
Dwayne... I'm not exhausted yet.

13:11.099 --> 13:13.600
I... It's just...

13:13.652 --> 13:15.202
Worrisome.

13:15.270 --> 13:16.936
Dwayne...

13:16.989 --> 13:18.572
you were injected
with a copious amount

13:18.624 --> 13:20.774
of LSD when you were abducted.

13:20.826 --> 13:24.578
A small amount could create
cognitive disruptions.

13:24.630 --> 13:27.781
That amount...

13:27.833 --> 13:30.634
Grab that red book
over there, and look up

13:30.719 --> 13:33.387
serotonergic hallucinogens,

13:33.455 --> 13:35.622
and let's see what it says.

13:35.674 --> 13:38.425
Thanks, Loretta.

13:38.477 --> 13:39.893
Well, if I can't help a friend

13:39.961 --> 13:42.396
with a massive LSD overdose,

13:42.464 --> 13:44.398
who can I help?

13:46.185 --> 13:49.653
I wonder if there's a nice
engineer here at Paradiso

13:49.738 --> 13:51.104
we could set you up with?

13:51.156 --> 13:54.307
When did we start talking
about dating?

13:54.359 --> 13:56.159
You said you want to forget
about getting screwed over?

13:56.245 --> 13:57.744
Then you got to try to have fun.

13:57.813 --> 13:59.479
I'm not saying you got
to get married.

13:59.531 --> 14:01.281
Well, that is good,
because I am not divorced yet

14:01.333 --> 14:02.449
from my first husband.

14:02.501 --> 14:03.950
Since you brought that up...

14:04.002 --> 14:04.951
It's gonna happen.

14:05.003 --> 14:06.336
We just haven't
done the paperwork.

14:06.422 --> 14:08.171
Let me ask you a question.
If you were interviewing someone

14:08.257 --> 14:10.590
and they said that,
how would you feel? Really?

14:11.877 --> 14:13.326
Thank you for waiting.

14:13.378 --> 14:15.796
Hi. Hello. I'm Sheri Pruitt.

14:15.848 --> 14:16.830
This is my son Scott.

14:16.882 --> 14:17.831
Hi.

14:17.883 --> 14:19.132
I'm Special Agent Khoury.

14:19.184 --> 14:20.634
This is Special Agent Gregorio.

14:20.686 --> 14:22.302
We're very sorry for your loss.

14:22.354 --> 14:25.138
Thank you. I-I didn't think
that was gonna take so long.

14:25.190 --> 14:27.274
Everyone just
had a lot of questions

14:27.342 --> 14:29.643
about how Paradiso
was going to move forward.

14:29.695 --> 14:31.528
If you wouldn't mind just,

14:31.613 --> 14:34.448
signing this before we begin.

14:34.516 --> 14:36.366
- What is that?
- It's an NDA.

14:36.452 --> 14:38.285
We're federal agents.
We don't sign that.

14:39.354 --> 14:42.689
You'll, have to forgive us.

14:42.741 --> 14:44.124
We are in uncharted

14:44.192 --> 14:45.709
territory here.

14:45.794 --> 14:47.160
We understand.

14:47.212 --> 14:48.378
We're investigating
Mr. Pruitt's death;

14:48.464 --> 14:49.996
we're not looking
for venture capital.

14:50.048 --> 14:54.801
So... you don't think
the Navy pilot caused the crash?

14:54.870 --> 14:56.219
We don't know what to think yet.

14:56.305 --> 14:57.721
Is there anything you think
we should know?

14:57.806 --> 14:59.973
Me? No.

15:01.477 --> 15:03.477
Was Mr. Pruitt threatened?

15:03.545 --> 15:04.728
Involved in any

15:04.813 --> 15:06.680
nasty litigation? No.

15:06.732 --> 15:08.014
My stepfather did
extensive background checks

15:08.066 --> 15:10.049
on people before he went
into business with them.

15:10.102 --> 15:14.154
He... said life was too short
to work with jerks.

15:14.222 --> 15:15.388
What can we do

15:15.440 --> 15:16.656
to help you? Let's start

15:16.725 --> 15:19.359
with documents:
contracts, project lists,

15:19.411 --> 15:21.244
competitors, employees' records,

15:21.330 --> 15:23.413
especially anyone
who's left on bad terms.

15:23.499 --> 15:26.082
I'll get Andrew's assistant
to get you everything you need.

15:26.168 --> 15:28.335
Thank you. Okay.

15:30.289 --> 15:31.838
<i>Cade's a good resident.</i>

15:31.907 --> 15:35.425
Kind to the other guys,
super helpful around the house.

15:35.511 --> 15:40.347
And when he left, did he say
where he was going? No.

15:40.415 --> 15:43.517
He have any trouble
with anyone recently?

15:43.585 --> 15:45.919
No. Though, if I'm
completely honest with you,

15:45.971 --> 15:48.939
he had seemed a little anxious
over the past few days.

15:49.024 --> 15:50.440
What kind?

15:50.526 --> 15:52.091
Manic, or...

15:52.144 --> 15:55.278
he piss off the wrong guy?
Not sure.

15:55.364 --> 15:57.063
Tried talking to him, but...

15:57.115 --> 15:58.532
he wasn't interested.

16:01.436 --> 16:02.953
You think he was off his meds?

16:03.038 --> 16:04.237
Sure hope not.

16:11.279 --> 16:12.946
Wouldn't be the first time.

16:12.998 --> 16:15.448
And he's awfully good
at hiding things.

16:15.500 --> 16:16.716
I know. But...

16:16.785 --> 16:18.301
your brother's
been doing great here.

16:18.387 --> 16:20.587
Which is why I got worried
and gave you a call.

16:22.958 --> 16:24.958
And you said the last time
you saw him

16:25.010 --> 16:27.260
was night before last? Yeah,

16:27.312 --> 16:29.646
he got in his car right before
dinner and never came back.

16:29.731 --> 16:32.732
He's got a car? Yeah.

16:32.801 --> 16:34.684
He bought it, two months ago.

16:35.737 --> 16:37.153
What kind?

16:37.239 --> 16:39.439
<i>"And finally, longer periods</i>

16:39.491 --> 16:41.658
"of REM sleep as a result
of ingestion

16:41.743 --> 16:45.111
create increased levels
of cognitive disruption"...

16:45.163 --> 16:46.496
Just like you said...

16:46.582 --> 16:48.314
"not dissimilar to

16:48.367 --> 16:50.817
other types
of psychedelic experiences."

16:50.869 --> 16:53.787
Well... that explains that.

16:53.839 --> 16:56.790
Well, in short, you sleep
deeper, but in this case,

16:56.842 --> 16:58.091
it's no good.

16:58.159 --> 17:00.677
I have a friend,
she's a neurologist at Tulane,

17:00.762 --> 17:05.265
and she's done a lot of work
in pharmacological psychedelics.

17:05.333 --> 17:07.349
I could give her a call
when I'm finished.

17:12.941 --> 17:14.357
Everything okay?

17:14.443 --> 17:16.192
I'm seeing something.

17:16.278 --> 17:17.944
Could be a crown, but...

17:18.012 --> 17:19.445
it's awfully reflective.

17:29.408 --> 17:31.324
I'll need a tweezer.

17:39.468 --> 17:41.384
What the hell is this?

17:41.470 --> 17:43.136
Engineered tungsten carbide.

17:43.204 --> 17:45.204
What's it doing in his mouth?

17:45.257 --> 17:46.706
I have no idea,
but we found some

17:46.758 --> 17:48.875
in Pruitt's airplane engine.

17:48.927 --> 17:51.227
Not enough to cause an accident,

17:51.313 --> 17:52.879
but still, something that
shouldn't have been there.

17:52.931 --> 17:56.016
I'm guessing this doesn't belong
in here, either.

18:10.332 --> 18:11.865
Bet that's part of a drone.

18:11.917 --> 18:15.335
Why would Mr. Pruitt
have a drone in his throat?

18:23.804 --> 18:26.137
That looks exactly like
what I saw.

18:26.190 --> 18:28.323
But those are birds, aren't they?
Yeah, starlings.

18:28.408 --> 18:30.975
There's no bird that can fly
as fast as an airplane.

18:31.028 --> 18:32.410
Well, the white-throated
needletail

18:32.479 --> 18:33.662
can go 105 miles an hour.

18:33.747 --> 18:34.913
That's faster
than most prop planes

18:34.981 --> 18:36.815
at takeoff, but...

18:36.867 --> 18:38.416
We're not suggesting the birds
attacked the plane.

18:38.485 --> 18:39.818
No, this is called murmuration.

18:39.870 --> 18:41.787
I wanted you to see it
just so you could confirm

18:41.839 --> 18:43.338
that it resembled what you saw.

18:43.423 --> 18:45.757
We think this is part of
what brought down the plane.

18:50.013 --> 18:52.464
Looks like it's
from a small drone.

18:52.516 --> 18:54.800
Yeah, it is. And there were
a bunch of them, too.

18:54.852 --> 18:56.167
All moving independently,
but acting as one.

18:56.220 --> 18:58.136
That's how you saw them back up
and then attack again.

18:58.188 --> 18:59.971
So I had nothing to do
with the pilot dying?

19:00.023 --> 19:02.307
Nope. He died due to the
impact of hitting the water.

19:02.359 --> 19:04.008
But we believe he lost
control of the plane

19:04.061 --> 19:05.644
from being attacked
by this swarm.

19:05.696 --> 19:07.479
Yeah, the technical term for
this type of movement

19:07.531 --> 19:09.447
is called
scale-free correlation.

19:09.516 --> 19:11.483
It's like the critical systems
involved in crystal formation

19:11.535 --> 19:13.685
or ferromagnetism.
The only problem is,

19:13.737 --> 19:15.787
as far as we know,
the technology doesn't exist

19:15.856 --> 19:16.955
for drones to do it.

19:17.023 --> 19:19.124
Well, clearly it does. Yeah.

19:19.193 --> 19:20.792
And if they can bring a
prop plane down with them,

19:20.861 --> 19:23.411
we have to catch them before
they move on to a bigger target.

19:27.251 --> 19:28.717
Just because that car's
on my lot

19:28.802 --> 19:30.535
doesn't mean
I did anything wrong.

19:30.587 --> 19:33.722
I bought it fair and square,
and I don't have to help you.

19:33.807 --> 19:36.675
I notice some of these cars
don't have buyers' guides.

19:36.727 --> 19:38.877
I assume they're filed
away in your office?

19:38.929 --> 19:41.713
Local law enforcement might want
to check them when they stop by.

19:41.765 --> 19:43.381
You're threatening me. Nope.

19:43.433 --> 19:46.234
Just helping the locals
vigorously enforce the law.

19:46.320 --> 19:47.319
Open it.

19:51.057 --> 19:54.576
If you find anything in there,
it's mine. I bought it.

19:54.661 --> 19:57.696
Did he say why he needed the money?
Nope.

19:57.748 --> 20:00.916
Did he say where he was going?
No.

20:01.001 --> 20:03.251
Did he leave with anyone?
I don't know.

20:03.337 --> 20:07.238
I'm sure I can find some
consumer credit violations,

20:07.291 --> 20:09.374
if I put my mind to it.

20:09.426 --> 20:12.243
I believe he left on foot.

20:12.296 --> 20:14.179
Headed around the corner.

20:14.247 --> 20:15.931
No idea where.

20:16.016 --> 20:17.749
I had it detailed,
Agent Lasalle.

20:17.801 --> 20:20.719
If there was anything good in
there, they probably stole it.

20:32.616 --> 20:33.732
<i>Well, you saw the movie.</i>

20:33.784 --> 20:34.933
<i>Yes, dear.</i>

20:34.985 --> 20:36.601
Movie night. All five of them.

20:36.653 --> 20:38.737
And I will never get
those 14 hours back.

20:38.789 --> 20:40.288
What does this have to do
with our drones?

20:40.374 --> 20:42.374
Well, the "Terminator Conundrum"
means you don't develop

20:42.442 --> 20:44.042
a thinking weapon
that can turn on you.

20:44.110 --> 20:45.627
A world ruled by bots.

20:45.712 --> 20:47.245
Not exactly why the U.S.
draws the line

20:47.297 --> 20:49.047
at fully autonomous weaponry.

20:49.115 --> 20:51.249
Well, the line only exists
as long as nobody crosses it.

20:51.301 --> 20:52.467
Lieutenant Meyer's commander

20:52.552 --> 20:54.803
won't clear her to fly yet.

20:54.888 --> 20:56.137
She didn't down that plane.

20:56.223 --> 20:58.623
Well, we have a theory,
not proof.

20:58.675 --> 21:00.725
When we find these drones,

21:00.794 --> 21:03.395
we'll make sure she
gets her wings back.

21:06.016 --> 21:07.465
My contacts aren't
aware of any military

21:07.517 --> 21:11.486
weapons program working on
scale-free correlation software.

21:11.571 --> 21:13.638
Well, DARPA isn't
working on it, either.

21:13.690 --> 21:14.973
They got a call from Pruitt.

21:15.025 --> 21:16.975
Last week. Asked for a meeting,
wouldn't say why.

21:17.027 --> 21:18.977
Well, then, it's not
unreasonable to think

21:19.029 --> 21:21.446
that someone killed him
to stop the meeting.

21:21.498 --> 21:22.814
But that still doesn't explain

21:22.866 --> 21:24.249
why they would need a secret

21:24.317 --> 21:26.985
and highly valuable technology
to do so.

21:27.037 --> 21:28.253
Proof of concept?

21:28.321 --> 21:29.337
Maybe.

21:29.423 --> 21:31.673
Anyone at Paradiso
a likely suspect?

21:31.758 --> 21:34.960
Not yet. But it's a successful,
well-run company.

21:35.012 --> 21:36.928
Employees only leave when
the technologies they develop

21:36.997 --> 21:39.180
is something Paradiso
doesn't want a part of.

21:39.266 --> 21:41.599
But Pruitt will let them keep
the technology in exchange

21:41.668 --> 21:43.668
for a piece of the new business.

21:43.720 --> 21:45.186
Yeah. So far, most of
those folks have gone on,

21:45.272 --> 21:47.188
gotten venture money,
become billionaires,

21:47.274 --> 21:50.475
quarter billionaires,
or just lots of dollar-aires.

21:50.527 --> 21:53.311
Are the drones
Paradiso technology?

21:53.363 --> 21:55.647
If so, Pruitt could've
realized the danger,

21:55.699 --> 21:57.365
and just didn't want
to pursue it.

21:57.451 --> 21:59.617
So some wannabe billionaire

21:59.686 --> 22:01.369
heard about his meeting
with DARPA and got angry

22:01.455 --> 22:03.488
that Pruitt was giving away
his genius?

22:03.540 --> 22:05.623
Maybe. We haven't found anything

22:05.692 --> 22:07.358
like that yet.

22:07.411 --> 22:08.860
I do have an idea
on how to track the swarm,

22:08.912 --> 22:10.962
but it's gonna take a bit
to pull it together.

22:11.031 --> 22:12.363
All right, well, Gregorio,
help him. We don't have time.

22:12.416 --> 22:13.665
All right. If this technology

22:13.717 --> 22:15.033
ends up in the wrong hands,

22:15.085 --> 22:16.718
- we end up...
- Underground,

22:16.803 --> 22:19.137
trying to stop a Terminator
from killing a young woman.

22:20.557 --> 22:22.040
No more movie night for you.

22:22.092 --> 22:23.541
- That's a good idea.
- I'll call NSA,

22:23.593 --> 22:26.144
see if any foreign nationals are
talking about this kind of tech.

22:26.212 --> 22:28.563
Yeah. Hold on.

22:31.068 --> 22:32.901
About the desk...

22:32.986 --> 22:35.887
Look, Pride, we don't
have to talk about it anymore.

22:35.939 --> 22:37.322
We're gonna make this work.

22:37.390 --> 22:40.191
It's not about the desks.

22:41.445 --> 22:43.445
I'm gonna call NSA.

22:46.566 --> 22:47.999
<i>All I found was a receipt</i>

22:48.068 --> 22:49.734
to a burger joint across town.

22:49.786 --> 22:50.919
Not much to go on.

22:51.004 --> 22:52.670
Follow the string.

22:52.739 --> 22:55.073
Can't know what the truth is
until you get there.

22:55.125 --> 22:56.541
What I don't get is why

22:56.593 --> 22:58.242
he sold his car.

22:58.295 --> 23:01.746
I mean, he was doing
pretty good here, recently.

23:01.798 --> 23:04.015
You only sell your car
if you need money fast.

23:04.084 --> 23:05.517
Well, whatever the reason,
he's missing

23:05.585 --> 23:06.885
and you need to find him.

23:06.937 --> 23:09.253
I know. I know.

23:09.306 --> 23:10.522
It's just...

23:12.258 --> 23:15.693
It's hitting me harder
than I expected, King.

23:15.762 --> 23:18.229
Found a photo in his room.

23:18.281 --> 23:21.366
Two of us were fishing
when we were kids.

23:21.434 --> 23:23.368
Happy as could be.

23:23.436 --> 23:28.373
And then... I just didn't think
it would end up like this.

23:31.461 --> 23:33.244
Let me know if you need
anything, okay?

23:35.715 --> 23:37.715
Will do, King.

23:39.052 --> 23:40.251
My NSA contacts haven't heard

23:40.303 --> 23:41.786
about any foreign governments

23:41.838 --> 23:45.423
possessing scale-free
correlation software, but...

23:45.475 --> 23:47.725
they have been hearing
the word "swarm" on calls

23:47.794 --> 23:50.261
between two black
market arms dealers.

23:50.313 --> 23:52.730
Any chance
they're just lovers of bees?

23:52.799 --> 23:54.816
Not unless bees
have gotten really expensive.

23:54.901 --> 23:56.568
They have been mentioning

23:56.636 --> 23:58.069
a price tag.

23:58.138 --> 23:59.654
Looks like the software
is for sale.

23:59.739 --> 24:01.106
Just got to hope
that Sebastian and Gregorio

24:01.158 --> 24:03.074
can figure out how to find it.

24:03.143 --> 24:04.659
<i>Because the swarm
suddenly appeared</i>

24:04.744 --> 24:06.828
on the Hornet's radar,
it's clear that it wasn't moving

24:06.913 --> 24:08.663
as one mass
to the attack location.

24:08.748 --> 24:10.782
And whoever sent it was smart
enough to send it separately

24:10.834 --> 24:12.784
and then have it clump
together at the last minute.

24:12.836 --> 24:14.335
Right. So, we calculated that...

24:14.421 --> 24:15.486
He calculated.

24:15.539 --> 24:17.338
Okay, I calculated,
that the, battery life

24:17.424 --> 24:19.991
on one of these drones is worth
about five miles of flight,

24:20.043 --> 24:22.994
so if we could enhance the
available radar in that zone,

24:23.046 --> 24:25.430
we should be able to pick up
the trail of the drones

24:25.498 --> 24:27.298
and track them back
to the launch site.

24:27.350 --> 24:30.385
This is the Hornet's
radar, enhanced.

24:31.938 --> 24:34.222
Which leads us to the local
weather Doppler, enhanced.

24:35.859 --> 24:36.891
Which leads us to...

24:38.528 --> 24:39.677
local ATCs.

24:39.729 --> 24:40.979
And these threads,

24:41.031 --> 24:42.513
they're all drones
that were sent out

24:42.566 --> 24:44.515
in a more westerly direction,
but they all originated

24:44.568 --> 24:45.984
from the same site, right here.

24:47.037 --> 24:48.319
Algiers.

24:48.371 --> 24:49.654
Now, radar's not precise enough

24:49.706 --> 24:51.189
to give us a specific location,

24:51.241 --> 24:53.658
but we can narrow it down
to four or five blocks.

24:53.710 --> 24:55.710
Have Patton start searching
for the buyers.

24:55.795 --> 24:58.546
I'll call NOPD, have them
help us search our target area.

24:58.632 --> 24:59.831
All right.

25:03.220 --> 25:04.719
It's effectively a demotion

25:04.804 --> 25:06.471
for both of them,
but he got to choose.

25:06.539 --> 25:08.139
And even though Hannah
and I aren't super tight,

25:08.208 --> 25:10.308
I feel like I owe her a
little... little sister power

25:10.376 --> 25:11.643
while she's going through this.

25:11.711 --> 25:13.645
You know what I'm saying?

25:13.713 --> 25:15.180
Hello?

25:15.232 --> 25:16.814
You gonna say anything or what?

25:16.883 --> 25:18.566
What... I like Pride, I like
Hannah. I think they're both

25:18.652 --> 25:20.685
great at their jobs,
I feel lucky to work with them.

25:20.737 --> 25:23.387
That's the limpest thing
you've ever uttered.

25:23.440 --> 25:26.390
Look, I know that you have very
strong feelings about this...

25:26.443 --> 25:29.027
Yeah. Yeah... and I just, I
don't want you to get mad at me.

25:29.079 --> 25:30.195
Get mad at you? For what?

25:30.247 --> 25:31.996
Because you decide
to have a controversial

25:32.065 --> 25:33.831
and perhaps boneheaded opinion?

25:33.900 --> 25:35.416
What? No.
Okay, see, right there?

25:35.502 --> 25:37.252
That's you,
that's you getting mad.

25:37.337 --> 25:39.204
Me? I'm not mad. I'm not mad.
You're getting mad right now.

25:39.256 --> 25:41.422
I'm not mad at all. The more we're
talking about it, the more... shh.

25:41.508 --> 25:43.174
That electrical panel,

25:43.243 --> 25:44.926
it's awfully fancy
for that warehouse.

25:45.011 --> 25:46.594
Seems like more power than
you'd need for just lights

25:46.680 --> 25:47.845
and a conveyor belt.

25:47.914 --> 25:49.464
All right.

26:14.541 --> 26:16.274
Check this...

26:16.326 --> 26:18.293
Tammy?

26:18.378 --> 26:19.794
Don't move.

26:19.879 --> 26:21.579
What?

26:25.618 --> 26:27.135
Run!

26:38.685 --> 26:40.018
All right. The machines win.

26:40.070 --> 26:41.686
I don't care what happens
in the movies.

26:41.739 --> 26:42.988
Well,

26:43.040 --> 26:45.374
they got to be motion-activated.

26:45.459 --> 26:46.492
Right. Which means

26:46.544 --> 26:47.993
that whoever controls them

26:48.045 --> 26:49.878
has to have some way
to turn them off

26:49.964 --> 26:51.530
so they don't get shot when
they enter the workshop.

26:51.582 --> 26:54.299
Okay. Well, you have any idea
how that might work?

26:54.368 --> 26:56.701
Of course not. Sh...

26:56.754 --> 26:58.170
Damn it, I have no signal.

26:58.222 --> 26:59.721
Well, that might be
for the best.

26:59.807 --> 27:01.007
If anyone found out
what's happening here,

27:01.041 --> 27:02.391
we'd never live it down.

27:02.476 --> 27:03.731
All right, well,
come up with something clever

27:03.761 --> 27:05.310
and get us out of here.
We'll be fine.

27:05.379 --> 27:07.179
Okay, yeah.

27:07.231 --> 27:08.921
Yeah. Come on. Get to thinking.
Yeah. All right. - sure.

27:08.983 --> 27:10.382
I got it. All right. So, yeah.

27:10.434 --> 27:12.017
They're motion-sensitive, right?
Yeah.

27:12.069 --> 27:14.486
So we just got to,
we got to give them some motion.

27:14.555 --> 27:15.821
It's probably
a template algorithm

27:15.889 --> 27:18.156
so they can differentiate
a face from a shadow.

27:18.225 --> 27:20.359
Yeah. And based on their size,

27:20.411 --> 27:22.727
they can probably only carry
a single load.

27:22.780 --> 27:24.229
They must have to be
within three or four feet

27:24.281 --> 27:26.415
to shoot with any accuracy.

27:26.500 --> 27:28.733
And I counted ten drones,
six shots.

27:28.786 --> 27:31.420
Five. Yeah. Five shots. So...

27:31.505 --> 27:33.839
Just take a picture of your face
with your phone,

27:33.907 --> 27:35.907
and then just slide it in there.

27:35.960 --> 27:37.843
Cheat it to the right,
to the open area,

27:37.911 --> 27:39.578
and then, the drones
with the live charges,

27:39.630 --> 27:41.046
hopefully they react.

27:42.132 --> 27:44.416
No. Not my phone.

27:44.468 --> 27:45.851
Come on, you know
I just got this phone.

27:45.919 --> 27:46.935
I got all
my vacation pictures on here.

27:47.021 --> 27:48.420
I still haven't downloaded them.

27:48.472 --> 27:50.939
This is why I told you
about cloud storage.

27:51.025 --> 27:52.190
I don't care. I'm busy.

27:52.259 --> 27:53.559
Just trying to make
your life simpler.

27:57.481 --> 27:59.698
Think I should do one that's a
little more... I think it's fine.

27:59.766 --> 28:01.233
No, that's not... Sebastian.

28:01.285 --> 28:03.619
Okay, all right.

28:05.122 --> 28:06.738
Just...

28:12.446 --> 28:13.778
These things are clever, man.

28:13.831 --> 28:16.248
Yeah. All right. Your phone. Go.

28:16.300 --> 28:17.305
What are you talking about?

28:17.334 --> 28:18.617
What do we do

28:18.669 --> 28:21.303
if only one of them shoots,
or-or none?

28:21.388 --> 28:23.589
Then we wait for the batteries
to run out. Your phone, go.

28:23.641 --> 28:25.557
No. Then we wait.

28:25.626 --> 28:27.593
Or...

28:34.018 --> 28:35.128
What are you doing?

28:37.488 --> 28:39.905
Just wait a second.

28:44.745 --> 28:45.911
What...?

28:45.979 --> 28:47.812
I'm not really seeing the...
Shut up!

28:47.865 --> 28:49.081
Plan here.

28:54.538 --> 28:55.654
Okay.

28:55.706 --> 28:56.805
All right.

28:59.660 --> 29:00.825
You need me to help? Yeah.

29:00.878 --> 29:02.210
Grab that thing over there.

29:05.883 --> 29:07.215
Come on. Okay, all right.

29:12.056 --> 29:14.189
What are you doing?
Cover me more.

29:14.274 --> 29:15.440
What...?

29:15.509 --> 29:18.110
God.

29:27.955 --> 29:29.955
That went well.

29:39.199 --> 29:41.133
I haven't seen him much.

29:41.201 --> 29:43.702
Mostly when he's coming back
with food

29:43.754 --> 29:45.203
from that burger joint.

29:45.255 --> 29:46.838
I'll open it.

29:48.058 --> 29:49.341
I'm his brother, ma'am.

29:49.393 --> 29:51.009
Not looking for trouble.

29:51.061 --> 29:53.645
Then why not knock?

29:53.714 --> 29:55.880
Well, he may not
recognize me right away.

29:55.933 --> 29:59.818
And even if he does, he
may not see me as a friend.

29:59.886 --> 30:02.738
It's better if I set
the terms of introduction.

30:05.609 --> 30:08.527
And you should get gone.

30:23.761 --> 30:25.777
Cade?

30:36.256 --> 30:37.389
Where's Cade Lasalle?

30:37.441 --> 30:38.590
I don't know.

30:38.642 --> 30:40.108
Where is he? I don't know!

30:41.278 --> 30:44.446
Wait. You're Christopher.

30:45.983 --> 30:47.616
Y-You're his brother?

30:48.652 --> 30:49.768
Yes, I am.

30:49.820 --> 30:51.119
I'm Kelly.

30:51.205 --> 30:52.821
This is my son, Will.

30:56.276 --> 30:58.777
Cade's my boyfriend.

31:00.831 --> 31:03.615
Okay.

31:03.667 --> 31:05.250
Well, the counselors
at the halfway house

31:05.302 --> 31:06.885
were worried about him.

31:06.953 --> 31:08.754
I was just checking
to see if he's okay.

31:08.806 --> 31:11.089
We don't know if he's okay.

31:11.141 --> 31:13.141
He brought us here
a couple of days ago.

31:13.227 --> 31:15.594
Said he had to go take care
of something and he left.

31:17.464 --> 31:20.148
We haven't heard from him since.

31:24.688 --> 31:26.071
Yeah. Will do.

31:26.139 --> 31:27.739
What do you got?

31:27.808 --> 31:29.407
Found this in the workshop.

31:31.745 --> 31:33.495
Okay,<i> Event Horizon.</i>

31:33.580 --> 31:34.746
Yeah, it's the,
boundary defining

31:34.815 --> 31:37.365
where an event
can't affect anyone beyond it.

31:39.586 --> 31:41.002
So, it's a boat.

31:41.088 --> 31:42.671
Yeah, a super nerd boat.

31:47.010 --> 31:49.594
Stop it. I'm just trying to
figure out how these things work.

31:51.381 --> 31:54.999
The boat is registered to Scott
Sanders, Andrew's stepson.

31:55.052 --> 31:57.135
And the photo was
found in the workshop,

31:57.187 --> 31:59.521
along with the materials needed
to prototype the drones.

31:59.606 --> 32:00.856
Yeah, "Event Horizon" was a name

32:00.941 --> 32:03.508
on the Paradiso Technologies'
abandoned projects list.

32:03.560 --> 32:06.027
It's one of the only ones
that wasn't pursued internally

32:06.113 --> 32:07.529
or spun off
into its own company.

32:07.614 --> 32:09.347
We just assumed
it wasn't viable.

32:09.399 --> 32:11.650
But maybe Andrew Pruitt
didn't want a part of it,

32:11.702 --> 32:13.685
so he shut Scott down.

32:13.737 --> 32:16.288
Well, seems like a thin motive
for killing your stepfather.

32:16.356 --> 32:19.708
Andrew is seen as the genius
behind everything Paradiso does.

32:19.793 --> 32:22.460
And with Scott
having a PhD to Caltech,

32:22.529 --> 32:24.162
he was hired
as a marketing manager

32:24.214 --> 32:26.364
for a company
who doesn't do marketing.

32:26.416 --> 32:28.466
According to his mom,
things have been frosty

32:28.535 --> 32:31.136
between Scott and Andrew for
the past couple of weeks.

32:31.204 --> 32:33.638
So the kid's thinking
his drone technology's

32:33.707 --> 32:36.892
a ticket to a big payday,
but when his stepdad decides

32:36.977 --> 32:39.210
to give it to DARPA,
he's had enough.

32:39.263 --> 32:41.179
Add to that
that we can't find him.

32:41.231 --> 32:42.514
He's not at home,
he's not at Paradiso,

32:42.566 --> 32:44.015
his phone's not pinging.

32:44.067 --> 32:45.383
Well, let's get to it.

32:45.435 --> 32:46.985
We need to track him down

32:47.053 --> 32:49.187
before he connects with a buyer
for that technology.

32:49.239 --> 32:50.655
All right.

32:53.577 --> 32:54.743
Yo.

32:54.828 --> 32:56.361
I'm gonna cut your nose hairs
with that drone

32:56.413 --> 32:57.612
if you don't stop.

32:59.232 --> 33:00.365
Anything yet?

33:00.417 --> 33:01.833
I was just about to call you.

33:01.902 --> 33:03.501
One of those arms
dealers is in Bosnia,

33:03.570 --> 33:05.337
having dinner at
a Chinese restaurant.

33:05.405 --> 33:07.756
The other one is flying like
a crow towards New Orleans.

33:07.841 --> 33:09.174
What airport is he landing at?

33:09.242 --> 33:12.177
Based on his flight path...

33:12.245 --> 33:13.378
Jefferson, 25 minutes.

33:13.430 --> 33:15.430
Good work.

33:43.827 --> 33:44.943
I got a positive ID.

33:44.995 --> 33:46.945
That's Yuri Gjonka.

33:46.997 --> 33:48.964
That's some fine
black market velour.

33:49.049 --> 33:50.448
Anyone have eyes

33:50.500 --> 33:51.833
on Sanders or his drones?

33:53.303 --> 33:55.053
Yeah, he's in the prop plane
in the hangar.

34:00.978 --> 34:04.429
Sit tight. We need to make sure
he's got his drones with him.

34:19.196 --> 34:20.478
Note to bad guy:

34:20.530 --> 34:21.830
don't leave the controller

34:21.915 --> 34:23.498
for your Terminator
on your workbench.

34:32.759 --> 34:34.826
Sebastian? I got it.

34:45.170 --> 34:46.187
NCIS!

34:46.273 --> 34:47.472
Drop your weapon!

34:47.524 --> 34:48.639
Hands in the air, now!

35:01.905 --> 35:03.354
Sebastian!

35:03.407 --> 35:04.906
Yeah.

35:08.045 --> 35:09.878
Drop it.

35:22.309 --> 35:25.176
You should get
a holster for that thing.

35:37.288 --> 35:38.354
Get in.

35:39.790 --> 35:41.674
Hey.

35:46.347 --> 35:48.648
Anybody know who that is? Nope.

36:00.144 --> 36:02.528
Hannah?

36:03.581 --> 36:05.147
Special Agent Khoury.

36:05.199 --> 36:07.116
What's going on, Winchester?

36:07.168 --> 36:10.652
We're helping you out.
Taking over this investigation.

36:10.705 --> 36:13.706
What investigation?
We've wrapped this up already.

36:14.825 --> 36:16.542
You need to see a warrant?

36:21.849 --> 36:23.849
No. Do what you do.

36:54.365 --> 36:55.697
That it?

37:01.205 --> 37:02.371
Thank you.

37:02.423 --> 37:04.056
Yeah.

37:10.714 --> 37:13.149
Who's that guy?

37:13.217 --> 37:15.735
A super secret ass.

37:17.772 --> 37:20.222
Well...

37:20.274 --> 37:22.558
good news is...

37:22.610 --> 37:24.326
no paperwork.

37:24.395 --> 37:26.112
Yes.

37:39.961 --> 37:43.379
Roy helped me, move it all.

37:48.970 --> 37:51.353
I know this is gonna
take some adjusting.

37:51.422 --> 37:53.355
And you can feel about it

37:53.424 --> 37:55.724
any way you want.

37:55.777 --> 37:57.860
But I'm just saying
you're too good an agent

37:57.928 --> 38:01.113
to be sitting in a tiny
desk in the corner.

38:02.150 --> 38:05.067
Nobody puts Baby in a corner.

38:08.990 --> 38:10.956
We don't have to talk about it.

38:13.494 --> 38:15.411
But I couldn't...

38:15.463 --> 38:17.413
let it be.

38:29.644 --> 38:31.594
This works.

38:33.231 --> 38:35.147
Okay.

38:35.233 --> 38:37.233
Good.

39:03.211 --> 39:04.826
We were just doing our job.

39:04.879 --> 39:07.179
I'm glad it worked
out. All right.

39:07.265 --> 39:09.515
Lieutenant Meyer
returned to flight status

39:09.600 --> 39:11.500
and even received commendation
for her work on patrol.

39:11.552 --> 39:12.834
Great. Yep.

39:12.887 --> 39:14.503
Let's get a drink. Tammy?

39:14.555 --> 39:16.305
Yeah. I'm not a lesbian.

39:16.357 --> 39:18.674
I know. Then why are
we at a lesbian bar?

39:18.743 --> 39:21.944
Because you need to get into
the New Orleans spirit already!

39:22.012 --> 39:24.446
You know? Like, and this
is the perfect place

39:24.515 --> 39:27.650
for opening up without
investing in the outcome.

39:27.702 --> 39:28.702
I don't feel like that...

39:28.736 --> 39:30.686
Just do me a favor. Relax.

39:30.738 --> 39:32.121
Let me get us a drink.

39:32.189 --> 39:33.489
If someone talks to
you, just act normal.

39:34.525 --> 39:35.958
Okay.

39:36.026 --> 39:37.036
Great. Okay.

39:37.078 --> 39:38.994
Crazy.

39:39.046 --> 39:40.796
Hey, Tammy. Yeah.

39:40.864 --> 39:42.298
Thank you.

39:42.366 --> 39:44.366
Anytime.

39:46.087 --> 39:47.136
Excuse me.

39:51.058 --> 39:52.591
Hi.

39:56.764 --> 39:57.897
I'm not a lesbian.

39:57.982 --> 39:59.231
Good for you.

40:00.568 --> 40:04.553
So, "not a lesbian,"
what brings you here tonight?

40:07.057 --> 40:08.574
<i>My friend</i>

40:08.659 --> 40:09.891
at Tulane basically confirmed

40:09.944 --> 40:11.193
what I thought.

40:11.245 --> 40:13.562
A massive dose of LSD

40:13.614 --> 40:17.065
could alter
some neural networks,

40:17.118 --> 40:19.868
loosen up, memories
that were lost.

40:19.921 --> 40:21.236
Which would explain
the little girl

40:21.289 --> 40:24.256
but, not the guy
in the red suit.

40:24.342 --> 40:27.843
Well, might be
that the craziness was stirred

40:27.911 --> 40:29.578
by the drugs.

40:29.630 --> 40:31.380
Is it permanent?

40:31.432 --> 40:32.848
It shouldn't be.

40:32.916 --> 40:34.934
There are things
you can do to help

40:35.019 --> 40:36.769
as well as getting
a better night's sleep.

40:36.854 --> 40:38.103
Yeah.

40:38.189 --> 40:40.589
I'll send you
her contact information.

40:40.641 --> 40:42.274
Thank you.

40:52.286 --> 40:54.403
Hey.

40:54.455 --> 40:55.871
King.

40:57.107 --> 40:59.074
I'm sorry to interrupt. No.

40:59.126 --> 41:00.609
It's never an interruption,
Chris.

41:00.661 --> 41:02.294
Did you find your brother?

41:03.331 --> 41:04.747
No.

41:04.799 --> 41:06.081
But I did find the woman
he's been seeing

41:06.133 --> 41:09.718
for six months
and her teenage son.

41:09.787 --> 41:14.423
Cade put them into hiding
and then left.

41:19.013 --> 41:21.563
Look, I made some amberjack.
Loretta and I

41:21.632 --> 41:23.265
were just about to eat. There's
more than enough for you.

41:23.317 --> 41:24.733
Come sit down.

41:28.189 --> 41:30.472
I should get back. Wh-Where?

41:30.524 --> 41:32.441
To Alabama? No, my house.

41:32.493 --> 41:35.160
I brought the two of them there
to keep them safe

41:35.246 --> 41:36.645
since...

41:36.697 --> 41:38.247
I don't have a clue

41:38.315 --> 41:40.082
what Cade got himself into.

41:40.151 --> 41:41.834
Come on in.

41:41.919 --> 41:43.619
Just for a while.

41:43.671 --> 41:46.455
Come on in, Chris. We're family.

41:46.507 --> 41:49.675
Come on. We'll talk it through.

41:58.719 --> 42:02.221
Hey. Just in case
you change your mind.

42:03.691 --> 42:04.723
Thank you.
