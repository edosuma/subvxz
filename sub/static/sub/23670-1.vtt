WEBVTT

13:24.760 --> 13:26.671
Would you like a sweet,
Monsieur Hulot?

15:20.720 --> 15:22.551
Get ready!

15:26.840 --> 15:30.913
Why don't you watch where you're
going? The light's red

15:31.080 --> 15:35.710
Twenty-five years as a taxi-driver,
and then something like this happens

15:35.880 --> 15:39.429
Are you crazy? Nothing at all
has happened to your car

15:46.440 --> 15:48.874
Oh, kids!

16:15.160 --> 16:18.948
I've been driving for a very
long time, Madame

16:20.800 --> 16:26.989
Sol know that, in theory, brakes
are meant for stopping

16:27.160 --> 16:30.596
I don't see what you're getting at.
I stopped

16:30.840 --> 16:37.109
Yes, too late. The lights red,
you could have caused an accident

16:40.680 --> 16:43.069
It was the children

16:44.880 --> 16:46.313
Forgive me, Madame

17:08.000 --> 17:10.195
What's wrong?

17:13.200 --> 17:15.350
Naughty boy!

18:24.080 --> 18:28.756
l was passing and thought I must call
to see how you're getting on

18:29.000 --> 18:32.310
How nice of you to come; I've been
expecting a visit for ages

18:32.520 --> 18:35.432
I knew you'd be busy with builders

18:35.640 --> 18:38.473
The garden is barely finished

18:38.800 --> 18:41.268
All this must have taken...

18:41.440 --> 18:45.069
lt's starting to take shape.
The hall you can see

18:46.760 --> 18:49.638
So practical, with everything
communicating

18:50.680 --> 18:53.399
That must be Gerard. Excuse me

19:09.080 --> 19:11.514
Aren't you coming in?

19:22.520 --> 19:26.957
As you see, the rooms are perfectly
placed, all looking onto the garden

19:27.120 --> 19:28.838
Very nice

19:29.520 --> 19:31.988
You're looking at my hat, I see

19:32.160 --> 19:37.598
You're still with the same modiste?
Lucky you. I'm hard to please hatwise

19:40.120 --> 19:42.395
Let's go and see Gerard

19:48.160 --> 19:51.391
Gerard darling, say good afternoon
to Madame Dubreuil

19:52.080 --> 19:54.753
Really, Gerard... do be nice

19:57.360 --> 20:02.229
Put your things away and don't
make a mess. Take your shoes off

20:03.160 --> 20:07.392
Scrub your hands. Gerard,
are you listening to me?

20:09.440 --> 20:14.195
Hang your jacket up properly
and put on your slippers

20:14.440 --> 20:18.877
He never answers, you'll notice.
Exacting obedience isn't easy

20:19.160 --> 20:21.151
That doesn't surprise me

20:21.360 --> 20:26.070
It's different when his uncle collects
him; he's not slow to enjoy himself

20:26.920 --> 20:30.833
80 late? Here I am chatting,
keeping you from your housework

20:31.080 --> 20:33.071
Oh, the modern house, you know...

20:33.240 --> 20:36.596
I know what an effort the upkeep
must demand of you

20:36.760 --> 20:39.911
-Yes, it's hard
-Admit that you love it

20:41.400 --> 20:44.472
-l'm off
-|'|| let you out

21:15.000 --> 21:17.309
No, it's me

21:22.840 --> 21:26.674
Hurry... hurry... and don't
make a sound

21:36.560 --> 21:39.836
Look how hard he's working

21:45.280 --> 21:47.510
Like his father

22:14.120 --> 22:16.873
It's just half-past.
Can I switch on?

22:23.440 --> 22:29.709
Tonight, as every night at III/s hour,
Professor P/afovs programme

22:29.880 --> 22:34.192
Tn/s evening: ”For You To Thin/r About”

22:43.600 --> 22:47.991
There they are, we've got to
catch them!

23:13.840 --> 23:17.230
Have you any grapefruit?

23:43.280 --> 23:46.431
They can't weigh as much as that

23:57.840 --> 24:03.710
He's got a flat tyre, so
everything's off-balance

25:12.160 --> 25:18.599
l'm embarrassed to ask, but I'd be
proud to see my brother-in-law join...

25:22.880 --> 25:26.475
-Very well, ask your brother...
-Brother—in-law

25:26.680 --> 25:30.309
...brother-in-law to contact our
personnel manager, Madamoiselle venier

25:30.480 --> 25:33.597
In that case, if I may,
l'll telephone him

25:40.880 --> 25:44.668
Can you connect me with number 24
at Saint-Maur?

25:45.240 --> 25:50.075
My brother-in-law has no telephone,
he can be reached at this number

25:55.040 --> 25:58.794
May I speak to Monsieur Hulot, please?

26:03.160 --> 26:06.118
Hulot? This is your brother-in-law,
Arpel

26:07.160 --> 26:12.712
You are to go to C.B.P.C...
Yes, Coal By-Products Company

26:14.480 --> 26:16.550
He's at a cafe, you see

26:19.120 --> 26:21.759
In a quarter of an hour

26:26.160 --> 26:29.516
It only remains for me to thank you,
Monsieur le President

26:42.760 --> 26:45.194
I'll say we're not to be disturbed

29:19.080 --> 29:23.517
It's very straightforward. You
start at eight, work till twelve

29:26.480 --> 29:31.076
One hour for lunch. Start again
at one o'clock...

29:36.000 --> 29:38.195
...and work on till six

29:38.640 --> 29:41.313
Your Sundays are your own, of course

30:11.760 --> 30:14.069
We will be writing to you

30:14.800 --> 30:17.758
We have no call for acrobats
at the moment

30:22.600 --> 30:25.114
No, you can leave this way

30:29.960 --> 30:32.394
You can see what's going on
next door...

30:33.440 --> 30:35.829
...without recourse to gymnastics

30:48.480 --> 30:50.072
WAY OUT

30:59.520 --> 31:03.149
What can I do for you, Madame?

31:04.160 --> 31:08.870
I'm your neighbour. Forgive me,
but I found this in my garden

31:11.320 --> 31:15.996
-I can't let you just run away
-I don't want to put you to trouble

31:19.880 --> 31:24.271
Look at what you did, Gerard,
you wicked boy

31:32.840 --> 31:35.229
This is the living-room

31:38.440 --> 31:41.477
And this is Gerard's room

31:43.160 --> 31:45.469
Everything communicating, as you see

31:54.920 --> 31:58.151
This is our little nook

32:01.200 --> 32:02.918
Air-conditioned throughout

32:03.960 --> 32:08.431
All the designs were done
in my husband's factory

32:08.680 --> 32:12.514
How original... can one sit on it?
May I?

32:19.200 --> 32:21.270
My steak!

32:43.560 --> 32:45.755
Stand back; the gravy, you know

33:08.560 --> 33:10.949
Charles, this is our neighbour

33:11.120 --> 33:15.989
Bravo! The whole place is a knockout

33:22.800 --> 33:27.874
A surprise for you, Gerard...
look at the lovely engine

33:35.320 --> 33:40.997
You're so lucky. As for me,
I'm all alone...

33:42.360 --> 33:45.113
...in my vast barn of a place

34:10.680 --> 34:13.990
So he turned up? No, not Hublot...
Hulot

34:16.000 --> 34:19.709
He climbed up.... on the desk,
you say?

34:20.080 --> 34:23.356
To see what, Monsieur le President?

34:27.440 --> 34:29.351
Bravo your brother!

34:32.680 --> 34:34.591
Yes indeed, your brother!

34:35.080 --> 34:40.074
Thirty seconds in C.B.P.C.‘s employ,
a record. And / recommended him

36:04.040 --> 36:05.678
Everything all right?

38:10.440 --> 38:13.557
Charles, l have an idea

38:13.920 --> 38:17.549
His uncle, being free now,
can take him out

39:08.360 --> 39:10.430
Do take care, now

39:38.360 --> 39:41.113
Charles, your coffee is ready

41:17.640 --> 41:22.270
Just try these, boys, you'll taste
how good they are

41:22.480 --> 41:26.758
All piping hot, a bit of jam,
and there you are

41:27.160 --> 41:29.515
Two spoonfuls for me

41:32.800 --> 41:34.870
Do you put sugar on?

41:36.400 --> 41:42.509
There's a generous helping for you.
Just you taste that

41:43.040 --> 41:45.270
I want a big one

42:24.440 --> 42:26.556
Come on, quick

42:29.440 --> 42:30.793
Got money?

42:42.000 --> 42:43.399
A customer

42:47.560 --> 42:49.073
Your turn

42:55.240 --> 42:56.992
You win

43:04.240 --> 43:06.834
Put up your money

43:09.200 --> 43:12.397
Come on, you, here we go again

43:23.840 --> 43:26.070
You lose

43:26.640 --> 43:28.631
Money for me

43:29.440 --> 43:30.953
For me, too

43:35.040 --> 43:37.873
You stay and watch

43:48.880 --> 43:51.189
He's calling us, hurry!

44:05.560 --> 44:07.391
Your turn

44:13.400 --> 44:15.197
You lose

44:19.400 --> 44:22.870
-I win
-No, you don't. Hand it over

44:23.840 --> 44:27.594
You lost. Coming back doesn't count

44:31.720 --> 44:34.598
Quiet! Play on

44:43.880 --> 44:45.871
Steering needed, Bernard

44:59.600 --> 45:01.591
Your turn, Gerard

45:10.840 --> 45:15.630
Very clever! It's a sad day
when things come to this

45:35.000 --> 45:37.673
I did the steering, didn't I?

46:43.800 --> 46:48.749
It's beyond all reason.
Is there to be no end to it?

46:56.640 --> 46:58.710
After all, one mustn't
carry things too far

47:01.440 --> 47:04.193
If he doesn't like it here,
he can say so

47:12.040 --> 47:14.998
Whose money paid for this house?
It was mine

47:15.160 --> 47:19.233
I also pay for his clothes,
his schooling

47:21.240 --> 47:24.118
Maybe someone would like to
take my place?

47:24.520 --> 47:28.832
Well, why not? Come on,
no need for embarrassment

48:12.880 --> 48:15.952
Not eating... are you unwell?

48:16.880 --> 48:20.316
No, no, no, I've had enough

48:21.000 --> 48:26.279
His uncle, his uncle... he's not
even a good example, far from it

48:26.920 --> 48:29.229
And certainly no genius

48:34.920 --> 48:38.276
Don't work yourself up
into such a rage

48:38.480 --> 48:43.634
What my brother lacks is a purpose...

48:45.280 --> 48:49.751
...a home and all that goes with it

48:51.200 --> 48:54.875
Listen, that's our neighbour.
Come and have a look

48:55.040 --> 48:58.874
She lives alone... I spoke to her
again... she owns a remarkable house

48:59.080 --> 49:02.959
She is orderly, methodical,
and not without charm

49:03.160 --> 49:07.233
Seeing her again, I thought of
my brother... if you follow me

49:12.800 --> 49:17.715
The simple fact is, her house is
better looked after than ours

49:19.120 --> 49:21.918
l freely admit it

49:33.440 --> 49:39.549
My idea is: on Sunday we'll invite
a few friends to a reception for them

49:39.800 --> 49:44.351
Nothing official, you understand,
simply a sort of garden party

53:21.040 --> 53:24.999
Go in, you're always under my feet

53:25.320 --> 53:28.790
What a fine shirt... it that
Monsieur Hulot's?

53:34.840 --> 53:39.994
I'm going fishing; that's my way
of relaxing on Sundays

53:41.720 --> 53:47.317
I set out my bait... got a big one
last Sunday. I'm well armed, you see

54:11.040 --> 54:14.749
Thank you very much. Come inside

54:19.400 --> 54:22.437
Sorry, but a refusal will
make me cross

54:42.320 --> 54:45.437
Come and have a little drink

55:19.800 --> 55:25.830
A millionaire used to be something,
now you find millions everywhere

55:26.440 --> 55:29.830
We'd better grab some of them, then

55:31.080 --> 55:35.949
Your theory is all very well, but
it ignores one very simple thing

55:37.000 --> 55:42.199
There's no room for sentiment
nowadays. Every man for himself

55:54.960 --> 55:58.350
Gaston! Come on, we're waiting

56:43.360 --> 56:47.194
The same happened to me.
One shouldn't just accept it

56:47.360 --> 56:52.798
You can't make ends meet any more
after all your expenses are deducted

58:07.960 --> 58:13.671
Careful, Georgette... give that to me.
My husband will come out

58:15.320 --> 58:18.153
The guests will find nothing ready

58:18.320 --> 58:22.598
-Good day, friend. What do we owe you?
-650 francs

58:27.280 --> 58:29.669
Keep the change

58:54.000 --> 58:57.436
Take this tray, Charles, hurry!

59:26.160 --> 59:29.357
What is it? We don't need a thing

59:33.840 --> 59:39.756
It's no use insisting. We have
all the carpets we need

59:46.440 --> 59:48.749
It's our neighbour

59:53.800 --> 59:57.793
My dear, how nice of you to come

1:00:22.080 --> 1:00:25.868
Gerard, where are you running off to?
Come and say good afternoon

1:00:26.440 --> 1:00:28.431
The right hand, darling

1:00:28.920 --> 1:00:32.117
I'll leave you now; I still have
things to...

1:00:33.720 --> 1:00:36.757
We are wearing a lovely tie,
aren't we?

1:00:38.760 --> 1:00:41.479
What a big boy we are

1:00:44.360 --> 1:00:47.113
We're a good boy

1:00:49.760 --> 1:00:54.436
I know some lovely stories

1:00:56.120 --> 1:01:00.193
I make beautiful paper cutouts

1:01:07.840 --> 1:01:10.513
Ah, Pichard... I'll be right with you

1:01:22.720 --> 1:01:25.314
They're plastic... flowers that last

1:01:25.520 --> 1:01:27.750
Yes, you can smell the rubber

1:01:30.280 --> 1:01:33.238
Let's show you round...
our water feature

1:01:34.560 --> 1:01:38.394
Greetings, Madame. Delighted to
see you, my dear Walter

1:01:51.040 --> 1:01:53.679
I'll tell your mother,
Monsieur Gerard

1:02:08.720 --> 1:02:14.317
We produced 40,000 metres of piping,
a considerable achievement

1:02:17.480 --> 1:02:20.950
Especially as our new machine
hasn't come yet

1:02:22.000 --> 1:02:24.070
How interesting

1:02:33.080 --> 1:02:36.914
I bring refreshments for you
to make your selection

1:02:39.560 --> 1:02:41.790
Georgette, open the door

1:02:42.040 --> 1:02:44.315
It's my brother

1:03:09.920 --> 1:03:15.153
Follow me, my dear Walter. We'll be
more at ease on the terrace

1:03:16.840 --> 1:03:19.912
What's the news on the Stock Exchange?

1:03:20.080 --> 1:03:25.108
-Signs of a turn for the better
-Yes, that's my distinct impression

1:03:25.320 --> 1:03:29.791
Listed share prices aren't the only
significant indications, either

1:04:20.840 --> 1:04:25.709
Come and share the goodies.
The ladies insist

1:04:30.240 --> 1:04:35.837
Pichard, my friend, we've been
together a good many years...

1:04:35.960 --> 1:04:39.396
...and an idea came to me this morning

1:04:39.680 --> 1:04:43.798
Our business is booming, production
increases day by day

1:04:46.920 --> 1:04:49.354
He's my brother-in-law

1:04:51.440 --> 1:04:53.908
My colleague, Monsieur Pichard

1:04:56.320 --> 1:04:59.630
So, Pichard, let me explain my idea

1:04:59.800 --> 1:05:04.999
My brother-in-law needs to settle
down, to have a goal in life

1:05:07.240 --> 1:05:12.519
The time has come for him to settle
on a career for himself

1:05:13.720 --> 1:05:17.713
So I thought of taking him into
the factory with us

1:05:17.880 --> 1:05:21.714
You know the faith I have in you,
Pichard

1:05:23.120 --> 1:05:27.033
Here, of course, as you see,
we have the living-room

1:05:31.200 --> 1:05:35.955
-It feels empty
-|t's modern; all communicating

1:05:37.160 --> 1:05:40.516
Gerard's room... and over there,
the kitchen

1:05:40.720 --> 1:05:43.553
But that I don't want to show you

1:05:49.360 --> 1:05:52.238
It's a complete success!

1:05:52.400 --> 1:05:56.552
Here, my friends, I am at home
in my own domain

1:05:58.920 --> 1:06:00.592
For dishwashing, laundry...

1:06:05.120 --> 1:06:08.237
| press here for all vegetables...

1:06:08.960 --> 1:06:10.518
...sterilization

1:06:28.840 --> 1:06:32.958
Oh dear, he can't think of anything
but his factory

1:06:51.520 --> 1:06:55.877
Do take your places and I'll
introduce my brother

1:06:59.960 --> 1:07:02.997
Our neighbour, our dear neighbour

1:07:25.080 --> 1:07:26.832
Will you have some tea?

1:07:38.360 --> 1:07:42.512
My dear, I think you'll find it more
comfortable sitting over there

1:07:45.200 --> 1:07:47.919
You come and sit here

1:07:48.160 --> 1:07:51.835
Now, you two... our charming
neighbour, my brother

1:07:53.200 --> 1:07:56.476
Do sit down... there's a chair
for you

1:07:56.920 --> 1:08:01.072
You can move the chair closer
to our neighbour

1:08:01.360 --> 1:08:05.069
Joining my husband's company will do
his marital prospects no harm

1:08:06.400 --> 1:08:11.269
I'm giving you gin with a touch of
lemon, it's very refreshing

1:08:11.480 --> 1:08:13.391
I'll leave you two, then

1:08:13.640 --> 1:08:15.915
You are her appointed admirer

1:08:17.560 --> 1:08:20.677
I know a good one

1:08:38.560 --> 1:08:41.711
Your sister is a truly
charming woman

1:08:41.920 --> 1:08:46.516
Besides which, as the lady of
a house, she is amazing

1:08:46.720 --> 1:08:50.952
Her admirable qualities make her
an extraordinary person

1:08:52.280 --> 1:08:57.593
And we must not forget that Monsieur
Arpel is remarkable in every respect

1:08:57.760 --> 1:09:00.718
Authoritative, perfectly at ease

1:09:00.920 --> 1:09:05.516
They could be cited as an exemplary
couple, don't you agree?

1:09:06.160 --> 1:09:10.278
l was saying that as a couple they
could be cited as exemplary

1:09:10.600 --> 1:09:14.593
What joy for a woman to be able
to care for a...

1:09:16.000 --> 1:09:19.231
...a household, to have a purpose,
someone who...

1:09:19.400 --> 1:09:23.951
I'm telling you all this and
forgetting to pour your tea

1:09:29.280 --> 1:09:31.589
I'm so clumsy

1:09:35.000 --> 1:09:40.996
I'm not exaggerating when I say that
I'll never live it down

1:09:57.640 --> 1:10:00.473
It seems to be wet here

1:10:01.600 --> 1:10:06.037
Go round the other way, it should
be drier. Where's it coming from?

1:10:10.680 --> 1:10:15.310
My fountain isn't working.
Georgette, was that you?

1:10:16.360 --> 1:10:19.716
Don't just stand there,
help me do something

1:10:20.400 --> 1:10:23.995
You must have been tampering with it

1:10:25.040 --> 1:10:27.235
Monsieur Arpel was explaining...

1:10:27.360 --> 1:10:31.069
...the importance of your husband's
position in the company

1:10:38.320 --> 1:10:42.472
Stop, Georgette, you can't
do it like that

1:10:47.400 --> 1:10:51.393
It may be just a leak, which we'll
have repaired in the morning

1:10:51.600 --> 1:10:56.071
We can't leave it like that.
I'll show you

1:10:58.880 --> 1:11:01.440
Gerard, fetch the toolbox

1:11:55.880 --> 1:12:00.112
All right, turn the table lengthwise

1:12:03.360 --> 1:12:06.477
We won't be able to hold it up

1:12:34.200 --> 1:12:37.749
The chair... help us

1:12:49.280 --> 1:12:51.350
Do you know the Champarts?

1:12:52.040 --> 1:12:56.192
They've furnished a bungalow
in adorable Directoire style

1:12:56.320 --> 1:13:01.713
It's really most charming,
and adjoins a country club

1:13:08.000 --> 1:13:12.073
I almost forgot my dear friend
who hasn't had his tea

1:13:12.760 --> 1:13:14.830
It's for your brother

1:13:22.640 --> 1:13:24.232
He takes it the English way

1:13:29.920 --> 1:13:33.390
Who has a light? Your lighters,
gentlemen

1:13:44.120 --> 1:13:48.113
I'm sure my admirer has a...
how tall he is

1:13:51.520 --> 1:13:53.954
l'm saved! The quest is over

1:14:01.280 --> 1:14:04.511
He's very obliging, which is rare

1:14:04.680 --> 1:14:08.116
Gallantry is a lost art, they're
taken up with their own affairs

1:14:15.880 --> 1:14:20.192
Your brother isn't here any more...
where is he?

1:14:20.360 --> 1:14:23.432
There you are... I'm not
forgetting you

1:14:33.640 --> 1:14:36.598
The workman is served first

1:14:36.760 --> 1:14:41.550
You might show more concern.
I didn't askhim to do that

1:14:42.200 --> 1:14:46.557
Adee darling, come and take off my tie

1:14:50.560 --> 1:14:54.872
I'll give you a hand... you can't
manage on your own

1:14:55.520 --> 1:14:59.832
No, sir, you stay with your guests.
Your place isn't down here

1:15:15.880 --> 1:15:18.838
That's it. Now you can turn it on

1:15:32.640 --> 1:15:34.949
It will work, you'll see

1:15:47.200 --> 1:15:49.873
Well, I don't understand

1:15:51.400 --> 1:15:54.551
l have really no idea...

1:16:13.960 --> 1:16:16.394
Do you know who he is?

1:16:21.680 --> 1:16:25.639
It's a friend looking for me.
A most attentive admirer

1:16:47.720 --> 1:16:52.999
This is no time for Red lndians.
My garden!

1:17:13.920 --> 1:17:17.037
Bravo! Very clever!

1:17:19.840 --> 1:17:23.958
Don't just stand there, help me

1:17:30.880 --> 1:17:34.919
-You must have been dreadfully shaken
-Not at all

1:17:35.680 --> 1:17:38.069
What a state you're in, Pichard

1:17:38.240 --> 1:17:41.516
Someone had to sacrifice himself.
At least it's repaired

1:17:48.160 --> 1:17:53.359
It's nothing at all. You did get
our flowers, didn't you?

1:17:59.080 --> 1:18:01.753
Your glass, Madame

1:20:24.360 --> 1:20:28.353
Go away... run and hide

1:20:44.400 --> 1:20:48.552
Hold that for a minute while
I fetch the door

1:20:52.720 --> 1:20:54.836
It's a surprise for my husband

1:20:57.640 --> 1:21:02.350
A wedding anniversary gift. It must
be working by tonight

1:22:56.520 --> 1:22:58.351
Your client!

1:23:04.160 --> 1:23:06.833
The Director has arrived

1:23:25.880 --> 1:23:32.069
Samples of the piping exclusive to
our international company, Alastac

1:23:32.440 --> 1:23:37.878
Green piping for turf, for example,
and our latest novelty...

1:23:38.520 --> 1:23:42.274
The Remy company in Lyon
asks when we can deliver

1:23:42.400 --> 1:23:44.709
Certainly. Get on to Monsieur Hulot

1:24:01.880 --> 1:24:06.476
Have you the order for [he Remy
company in L yon ? Can you near me ?

1:24:12.240 --> 1:24:16.870
-How are you, Pichard?
-A bit stiff... you know...

1:24:18.160 --> 1:24:20.628
My right hand man, Monsieur Pichard

1:24:20.880 --> 1:24:26.876
Pichard will show you round. Excuse
me, I'm getting my new car

1:24:29.120 --> 1:24:34.592
I'll show you the stages of our new
manufacturing process

1:24:47.920 --> 1:24:51.310
There she is... what lines she has

1:24:55.080 --> 1:24:58.436
But tell me, how many cylinders?

1:24:58.600 --> 1:25:03.628
Speak not of cylinders or engines
since you'll never raise the bonnet

1:25:03.800 --> 1:25:07.918
Instead, admire the care and finish
that went into this bodywork

1:25:08.320 --> 1:25:12.359
The doors, sir, you can close the
door with but a single finger

1:25:12.520 --> 1:25:14.590
The same for the rear door

1:25:22.640 --> 1:25:24.915
But the absolutely unbeatable thing...

1:25:25.920 --> 1:25:29.117
...is the suspension

1:26:27.840 --> 1:26:30.149
Keep an eye on Number 5 for me

1:28:42.320 --> 1:28:48.190
...being carried to the
hydro-sandblasters...

1:28:48.400 --> 1:28:53.599
...where the polymerization is
accelerated by a catalyst

1:29:59.640 --> 1:30:03.269
A bit more and you can open
a delicatessen

1:30:05.640 --> 1:30:09.758
Old man Arpel in the food business,
can you imagine?

1:30:10.600 --> 1:30:12.636
You'll have to hide all this

1:30:13.960 --> 1:30:16.758
All right, you've had your fun

1:30:19.440 --> 1:30:23.558
It's quite simple. Our feeders being
provided with hot air humidifiers...

1:30:23.720 --> 1:30:29.352
...thermostatically controlled
permutation of the liquids...

1:30:32.600 --> 1:30:35.114
The boot is exceptionally spacious

1:30:35.320 --> 1:30:38.710
Here the spare tyre, here the
radio aerial

1:30:38.880 --> 1:30:43.317
Here you have a boot that will be
of great service to you

1:30:46.720 --> 1:30:51.430
Your registration papers,
and also your keys

1:30:51.600 --> 1:30:55.354
You'll be taking back my old car

1:30:57.840 --> 1:31:03.472
The gentleman has seen everything,
and is impressed by our installation

1:31:08.720 --> 1:31:12.998
Monsieur Arpel, there's something
I must tell you...

1:31:16.040 --> 1:31:18.554
Look what he's making

1:31:18.720 --> 1:31:21.359
It's not possible. Did he make that?

1:31:26.720 --> 1:31:29.553
l'm dreadfully sorry,
given my position

1:31:29.720 --> 1:31:32.598
Send Monsieur Hulot to me at once

1:31:32.760 --> 1:31:37.550
If I may say so, perhaps, given his
idiosyncratic character...

1:31:37.760 --> 1:31:42.788
That's all very well, but in a factory
like ours, this is unacceptable

1:31:46.720 --> 1:31:53.353
How could this sort of product
possibly interest Plastac's clients?

1:31:53.560 --> 1:31:55.835
Maybe the machine...

1:31:56.040 --> 1:32:00.397
This has never happened before, and
I swear it will never happen again

1:32:00.600 --> 1:32:05.071
Welcomed to the company
for personal reasons...

1:32:05.280 --> 1:32:08.875
...it was your duty to set an example

1:32:09.080 --> 1:32:14.677
This you have failed to do,
so much the worse for you

1:32:25.400 --> 1:32:30.952
Pichard, don't telephone Madame Arpel
about the car; it's to be a surprise

1:32:31.120 --> 1:32:34.078
It's our wedding anniversary

1:33:49.280 --> 1:33:52.875
Switch on, Georgette, the new one

1:34:04.120 --> 1:34:06.190
lt's him

1:34:09.360 --> 1:34:12.477
lt's Monsieur; open the door for him

1:34:29.800 --> 1:34:31.870
Happy anniversary!

1:34:36.480 --> 1:34:38.914
It was a surprise for you

1:34:41.200 --> 1:34:45.239
I'll show you... it will work
if we just walk in front of it

1:34:46.200 --> 1:34:51.228
No need of keys. Just what you wanted,
isn't it? Are you pleased?

1:34:53.400 --> 1:34:55.960
Happy anniversary!

1:35:10.800 --> 1:35:14.793
It's beautiful! I'll get in with you

1:35:37.280 --> 1:35:40.875
Daki, come here!

1:35:43.760 --> 1:35:46.479
He has to pass through the beam

1:35:52.600 --> 1:35:56.115
It's not working any more.
What will we do?

1:36:04.120 --> 1:36:07.669
Daki, try again

1:36:08.240 --> 1:36:11.949
We'll have to shout if we're
going to get out

1:36:12.520 --> 1:36:14.829
Georgette, let us out!

1:36:15.000 --> 1:36:18.197
The switch on the right...
no, not that one

1:36:18.840 --> 1:36:21.479
No, Georgette, the one above that

1:36:23.480 --> 1:36:26.597
Georgette, we're shut in the garage

1:36:34.440 --> 1:36:36.396
Listen to me, Georgette

1:36:36.720 --> 1:36:39.518
You see the two lights, there?

1:36:39.880 --> 1:36:43.395
To open the door, you just have to
walk through the beam

1:36:44.240 --> 1:36:48.518
I couldn't do that, Madame.
I'm too afraid of electricity

1:36:48.680 --> 1:36:54.198
There's nothing to fear. Just walk
forward to the magic eye

1:36:54.360 --> 1:36:58.876
The what eye? I can't, Monsieur,
I'll be electrocuted

1:36:59.080 --> 1:37:03.198
Just close your eyes, be brave
and step forward

1:37:07.400 --> 1:37:10.836
It's ridiculous. You'll have to
get used to it all

1:38:03.760 --> 1:38:06.069
A suicide!

1:38:06.200 --> 1:38:08.156
There's blood!

1:38:31.000 --> 1:38:33.195
You'll be ill

1:40:20.720 --> 1:40:23.109
We could go to the Sexy

1:40:23.280 --> 1:40:27.432
I prefer Constantine and
his sweet music

1:42:18.200 --> 1:42:22.796
Quieten down, or you'll rouse
the whole neighbourhood

1:42:27.560 --> 1:42:31.075
Why aren't you singing?
There's nobody about

1:42:31.920 --> 1:42:37.199
You hang on to your money.
What do you take me for?

1:42:56.280 --> 1:43:01.434
We had a good time, didn't we?
And what an orchestra!

1:44:16.240 --> 1:44:19.312
But that's the divan

1:44:22.520 --> 1:44:28.390
This can't go on. It's becoming
ridiculous

1:44:28.560 --> 1:44:31.632
And it sets a bad example for Gerard

1:44:31.840 --> 1:44:36.675
What do you mean, listen? All I hear
is his uncle this, his uncle that

1:44:36.840 --> 1:44:40.674
In other words, you're jealous.
You're jealous of him

1:44:46.360 --> 1:44:48.954
He has to go

1:44:53.760 --> 1:44:59.995
Pichard needs a good sales rep for
the provinces. You fit the bill

1:45:01.880 --> 1:45:04.155
That's my decision

1:45:23.160 --> 1:45:25.674
What a mess!

1:46:59.120 --> 1:47:01.315
Charles, you've forgotten your gloves!

1:50:07.200 --> 1:50:10.158
You're going away?

1:50:12.440 --> 1:50:14.317
What a pity

1:50:40.520 --> 1:50:45.230
It could do with something added,
a streak of red, perhaps?

1:53:09.680 --> 1:53:12.558
Let's go, Gerard
