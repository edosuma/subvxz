00:02.800 --> 00:06.133
- You entered into a devil's
bargain with Jack Crawford.

00:06.170 --> 00:08.138
- You know what looking
at this does.

00:08.170 --> 00:10.331
- Am I your psychiatrist, or are
we simply having conversations?

00:10.370 --> 00:12.509
- I don't want to get
in the middle of you and Jack.

00:12.540 --> 00:15.577
- I like you as a buffer.
- Graham likes you.

00:15.610 --> 00:17.578
- Because I want
to be his friend, and I am.

00:17.610 --> 00:19.475
- Well, it seems a shame
not to take advantage.

00:19.520 --> 00:22.216
- This is my friend Tobias.
- Good evening.

00:22.250 --> 00:25.219
- I hate being this neurotic.
- If you weren't neurotic,

00:25.250 --> 00:28.310
Franklyn, you would be
something much worse.

00:28.360 --> 00:31.454
- Whatever the Ripper was doing,
it worked.

00:40.440 --> 00:42.567

00:54.420 --> 00:57.685

(animal growling outside)

01:15.540 --> 01:19.135
(animal whining)

01:19.180 --> 01:21.740
(animal shrieking)

01:24.610 --> 01:28.842
(animal shrieking)

(cello playing "Minuet
in G Major" by Petzold)

01:56.280 --> 01:59.147
- These strings are harder
to bow than the regular ones.

01:59.180 --> 02:01.671
- You have to learn how to bow
authentic strings

02:01.720 --> 02:05.440
to better bow strings
how they're made today.
- I should learn to play

02:05.490 --> 02:08.482
the easier strings first,
then the harder ones.
- No, you shouldn't.

02:08.520 --> 02:10.488
- Are they really made
from cat guts?

02:10.530 --> 02:13.727
- Not always.

02:13.760 --> 02:20.529

(Playing "Minuet in G Major"
by Petzold)

03:02.280 --> 03:03.804
- That's better.

03:03.850 --> 03:05.579
Good.

03:05.610 --> 03:07.612
***

03:26.470 --> 03:29.507
(birds chirping)

03:29.540 --> 03:32.577
- If it wasn't a coyote,
the coyotes probably got it.

03:32.610 --> 03:36.239
Probably got it
even if it was a coyote.

03:36.280 --> 03:38.669
- You're not expecting
to find it alive, are you?

03:38.710 --> 03:40.712
- We'll be lucky
to find a paw.

03:42.850 --> 03:44.818
- So, you invited me over
to help you

03:44.850 --> 03:47.318
collect animal parts?
(Will chuckles.)

03:47.360 --> 03:50.249
- I invited you over on the
off chance we do find it alive.

03:50.290 --> 03:52.690
It's hard for me to wrangle
a wounded animal by myself.

03:54.700 --> 03:57.260
Did you think
it was a date?

03:57.300 --> 03:59.530
- Honestly,
it never crossed my mind.

03:59.570 --> 04:01.868
- Oh.
(Will chuckles.)

04:01.900 --> 04:03.765
Why not?

04:05.770 --> 04:07.931
- You just don't seem
like you date.

04:07.980 --> 04:11.575
- Oh. Too broken to date?

04:11.610 --> 04:13.578
- You're not broken.

04:13.620 --> 04:15.941
- What's your excuse?
- For not dating?

04:15.980 --> 04:18.949
Why are you assuming
I don't date?

04:18.990 --> 04:20.958
- Do you?

04:20.990 --> 04:22.582
- No.

04:24.590 --> 04:26.820
Seems like something
for somebody else.

04:26.860 --> 04:29.590
I'm sure I'll become
that somebody someday,

04:29.630 --> 04:31.962
but right now I think too much.

04:32.000 --> 04:33.763
- So,

04:33.800 --> 04:35.768
what are you gonna do?
Are you gonna try to think less,

04:35.800 --> 04:37.802
or are you just gonna wait
till it happens naturally?

04:37.840 --> 04:39.899
- I haven't thought
about it.

04:44.810 --> 04:46.778
Are you seeing
anything?

04:46.820 --> 04:48.617
- Uh, no, actually.

04:50.550 --> 04:52.859
I'm not even seeing any tracks.

04:52.890 --> 04:55.358
I mean, except for the ones
we made.

05:00.700 --> 05:02.497
- Good morning.

05:02.530 --> 05:04.066
Please, come in.

05:08.100 --> 05:10.739
- I have a lot of respect
for you.

05:10.770 --> 05:12.738
Since we can't be friends,

05:12.780 --> 05:16.705
or... you're not comfortable
with that,

05:16.750 --> 05:19.617
I found myself looking
at my friends through your eyes,

05:19.650 --> 05:23.780
imagining what your diagnosis
might be.

05:23.820 --> 05:26.380
- So you become
the psychoanalyst?

05:26.420 --> 05:28.081
- I become you.

05:28.120 --> 05:30.782
- Who are you
psychoanalyzing?

05:30.830 --> 05:33.719
(Franklyn sighs.)
- My friend Tobias.

05:33.760 --> 05:38.561
I... Googled "psychopaths",

05:38.600 --> 05:40.693
went down the checklist,

05:40.740 --> 05:43.937
_and I was
a little surprised

05:43.970 --> 05:48.031
to see how many boxes
I had checked.

05:48.080 --> 05:50.469
- Why were you so curious
to Google?

05:50.510 --> 05:52.614
- He's been saying
very dark things

05:52.650 --> 05:54.948
and then saying,
"Just kidding!" a lot.

05:54.980 --> 05:57.414
It started to seem
kind of crazy.

05:57.450 --> 05:59.042
- Psychopaths are not crazy.

05:59.090 --> 06:01.513
They're fully aware
of what they do

06:01.560 --> 06:03.824
and the consequences
of those actions.

06:03.860 --> 06:08.058
- Would you diagnose someone
like Tobias as a psychopath?

06:08.100 --> 06:11.467
Or, uh, are you supposed
to diagnose other people

06:11.500 --> 06:14.992
in front of me? Do you... Would
you rather just talk about me?

06:15.040 --> 06:17.008
- Not at all.

06:17.040 --> 06:19.406
- Are you bored with me?

06:19.440 --> 06:21.829
- No.

06:21.880 --> 06:26.101
This is your hour, Franklyn.
We will talk_ about whatever
you would like to talk about.

06:26.150 --> 06:28.812
- I'd like to talk about Tobias.
Perhaps you can

06:28.850 --> 06:31.182
help me analyze him.
- I'm not analyzing

06:31.220 --> 06:33.688
your friend; I'm analyzing
your perception of him.

06:33.720 --> 06:37.121
It may help you know yourself
better. You could be

06:37.160 --> 06:40.095
projecting onto him what
you consider to be your flaws.

06:40.130 --> 06:43.759
- Does that mean
that I'm a psychopath?

06:43.800 --> 06:45.995
- You're not a psychopath,

06:46.030 --> 06:49.158
although you may be attracted
to them.

07:05.050 --> 07:07.712
- The victim is Douglas Wilson,
a member

07:07.760 --> 07:10.149
of the Baltimore Metropolitan
Orchestra's brass section--

07:10.190 --> 07:11.851
a trombone player.

07:11.890 --> 07:14.859
He was killed shortly after
his last performance.

07:14.900 --> 07:16.891
Blunt force trauma
to the back of the head.

07:18.900 --> 07:20.731
- His killer brought him here

07:20.770 --> 07:23.864
to... put on a show.

07:31.910 --> 07:34.879
- Will, is it me, or is it
becoming easier for you to look?

07:34.920 --> 07:36.888
- I tell myself...

07:36.920 --> 07:38.888
it's purely
an intellectual exercise.

07:38.920 --> 07:40.888
- Well, in the narrow view
of forensics,

07:40.920 --> 07:43.787
that's exactly what it is.
- They're not any easier, Jack.

07:46.900 --> 07:48.856
I shake it off,

07:48.900 --> 07:50.595
keep on looking.

07:50.630 --> 07:52.894
- Good.

07:56.100 --> 07:59.103
You shake it off.
Get to work.

08:01.110 --> 08:04.102
We'll come back in
when you're ready for us.

08:27.800 --> 08:30.701
(ambient hum
growing in volume)

08:34.610 --> 08:38.649
(ambient pulse)

09:10.750 --> 09:14.174
- I open his throat
from the outside

09:14.220 --> 09:16.347
to open the trachea

09:16.380 --> 09:18.587
and expose the vocal chords.

09:21.020 --> 09:23.580
I open his throat
from the inside

09:23.630 --> 09:25.621
using the neck of a cello.

09:34.640 --> 09:36.437
Powder on the wound.

09:40.310 --> 09:43.279
Rosin from the bow.

09:43.310 --> 09:46.302
I wanted to play him.

09:46.350 --> 09:49.342
I wanted to create a sound.

09:52.050 --> 09:53.654
My sound.

09:55.660 --> 09:59.050
This... is my design.

10:01.760 --> 10:03.762
***

10:11.940 --> 10:16.775
(man clapping slowly)

10:32.030 --> 10:33.759
- I worry that I've made
Franklyn feel

10:33.800 --> 10:36.769
powerless.

10:36.800 --> 10:39.735
He wants to be my friend.

10:39.770 --> 10:43.968
_ His obsession with me is
interfering With his progress.

10:44.010 --> 10:47.707
I'm considering referring him
to another doctor.
- Referrals can be

10:47.740 --> 10:49.799
complicated.

10:49.850 --> 10:52.171
I referred you
to another psychiatrist.

10:52.210 --> 10:54.178
You refused.

10:54.220 --> 10:56.415
- I'm more tenacious
than Franklyn.

10:56.450 --> 10:59.908
- Why were you
so tenacious?

11:01.920 --> 11:05.321
- I feel protective of you.
You support me

11:05.360 --> 11:08.727
as a colleague and psychiatrist,
and as a human being.

11:08.760 --> 11:12.161
I want to be supportive
of you... after what happened.

11:12.200 --> 11:17.866
- I'm not the only psychiatrist
who's ever been attacked
by a patient.

11:17.910 --> 11:20.333
- I hesitated to even bring up
the subject

11:20.380 --> 11:23.349
of an obsessive patient
because of your traumatic

11:23.380 --> 11:27.373
experience.
- Hannibal...

11:27.420 --> 11:30.981
I'm your psychiatrist;
you're not mine.

11:38.060 --> 11:39.948
- (Jimmy): Played him
like a fiddle.

11:40.000 --> 11:41.399
- Along with rosin powder,

11:41.430 --> 11:45.161
we found sodium carbonate,
sulfur dioxide, lye,

11:45.200 --> 11:48.738
and olive oil in the wounds.
- What is the deal with
the olive oil?

11:48.770 --> 11:51.261
- Sure wasn't making salad.
- He removed anything

11:51.310 --> 11:54.108
non-muscular or fatty
from around the vocal folds.

11:54.140 --> 11:57.246
The chords themselves were
treated with a sulfur
dioxide solution.

11:57.280 --> 12:01.239
- The sulfur dioxide had
the effect of hardening
the vocal chords.

12:01.280 --> 12:03.487
- Made them easier to play.

12:03.520 --> 12:08.913
Had to open you up to get
a decent sound out of you.

12:12.860 --> 12:16.227
- (Bev): You pick it up
and can't play it, he'll
put you down and play you.

12:16.260 --> 12:19.969
- (Brian): He took the time
to whiten the vocal chords
before playing them.

12:20.000 --> 12:23.458
- It's not about whitening them;
It was about, um, increasing
elasticity.

12:23.510 --> 12:27.401
- He treated the vocal chords
the same way you treat
catgut string.

12:27.440 --> 12:30.500
Yes, I played
the violin.

12:34.880 --> 12:37.246
- This takes a steady hand.

12:37.290 --> 12:39.315
A confidence.

12:39.350 --> 12:41.489
He's killed before.

12:41.520 --> 12:45.081
- Like this?
- No, not like this.

12:45.130 --> 12:47.826
This is a skilled musician

12:47.860 --> 12:50.169
trying a new instrument.

12:59.880 --> 13:02.804
- Among the first musical
instruments were flutes

13:02.850 --> 13:04.841
carved from human bone.

13:06.850 --> 13:08.215
- This murder was

13:08.250 --> 13:11.219
a performance.

13:11.250 --> 13:13.855
- Every life is
a piece of music.

13:13.890 --> 13:17.326
Like music, we are finite
events, unique arrangements,

13:17.360 --> 13:20.329
sometimes harmonious,
sometimes dissonant.

13:20.360 --> 13:23.261
- Sometimes _
not worth hearing again.

13:23.300 --> 13:26.497
- He's a poet and a psychopath.
- And a craftsman.

13:26.530 --> 13:29.328
He was shrinking and tanning
the vocal chords.

13:29.370 --> 13:33.204
- Like turning iron wire
into musical steel string.

13:33.240 --> 13:35.435
Was there olive oil?

13:37.450 --> 13:39.509
- Yes.
- Whatever sound

13:39.550 --> 13:42.212
he was trying to produce,
it was an authentic one.

13:42.250 --> 13:46.584
_Olive oil hasn‘t been used
in the production of catgut
for over a century.

13:46.620 --> 13:49.953
It was said to increase
the life of the strings

13:49.990 --> 13:53.096
and create a sweeter,
more melodic sound.

13:53.130 --> 13:55.348
- No, I hear
what he was playing

13:55.400 --> 13:57.368
behind my eyes
when I close them.

13:57.400 --> 14:01.188
- What do you see
behind closed eyes?

14:05.910 --> 14:09.505
- Um... I see myself.

14:09.540 --> 14:12.247
- You said the_killer was
performing.

14:12.280 --> 14:15.340
Who was he performing for?
- I don't know. Um...

14:15.380 --> 14:18.918
patron of the arts?
A fellow musician? Or...

14:18.950 --> 14:20.315
another killer?

14:20.360 --> 14:23.579
- It's a serenade.

14:23.630 --> 14:28.658
- No, this isn't how he kills.
Normally, he doesn't kill
for an audience.

14:28.700 --> 14:31.294
- And you believe
he risked getting caught

14:31.330 --> 14:34.094
for a serenade?
- I believe

14:34.140 --> 14:37.268
he wants to show someone
how well he plays.

14:37.310 --> 14:40.507
- Do you remember

14:40.540 --> 14:44.078
when I said Tobias was saying
very dark things?

14:44.110 --> 14:46.977
- I made note of it.
- Well, he said that he wanted

14:47.020 --> 14:51.343
to cut someone's throat
and play it like a Violin.

14:51.390 --> 14:53.950
They found somebody
whose throat was cut

14:53.990 --> 14:55.878
and played like a violin.

14:57.990 --> 15:02.051
- So you think Tobias killed
that man at the symphony?
- I don't know.

15:02.100 --> 15:04.159
I-I...

15:06.430 --> 15:09.069
IfI do, do I have
to report it?

15:09.100 --> 15:11.000
- Do you have a reason not to?

15:11.040 --> 15:12.507
- What if I'm wrong?

15:12.540 --> 15:14.531
- What if you're right?

15:14.580 --> 15:16.332
- I'm always wrong.

15:16.380 --> 15:21.010
I don't know. Why would he say
something like that to me?

15:21.050 --> 15:23.644
- Why do you think?

15:26.590 --> 15:29.081
- 'Cause he knows I'd tell you.

15:38.100 --> 15:41.137
(cello playing)

15:51.280 --> 15:54.317
(Cello playing stops.)

16:04.160 --> 16:06.526
- You're Franklyn's therapist,
Dr. Lecter.

16:06.560 --> 16:08.528
Nice to see you again.
- Is it Tobias?

16:08.560 --> 16:10.118
- Yes.

16:10.170 --> 16:12.126
- Your strings are all gut.

16:12.170 --> 16:15.139
- I also carry steel and polymer
strings, if you prefer.

16:15.170 --> 16:16.592
- I prefer gut.

16:16.640 --> 16:21.031
Harps strung with gut still make
music after 2,000 years.

16:21.080 --> 16:23.298
(He plucks a string.)
- I didn't

16:23.350 --> 16:26.342
hear you ring the bell.
- I didn't want you
to stop playing.

16:26.380 --> 16:30.384
Was it an original composition?
- Something I've been writing.

16:30.420 --> 16:32.786
You compose?
- I discover.

16:32.820 --> 16:35.414
Can't impose
traditional composition

16:35.460 --> 16:37.781
on_ an instrument
that's inherently freeform.

16:37.830 --> 16:40.355
- What instrument would that be?

16:40.400 --> 16:42.493
- The theremin.

16:42.530 --> 16:45.169
It can generate any pitch
throughout its range--

16:45.200 --> 16:47.498
even those
between conventional notes.

16:47.540 --> 16:49.098
- And so can a violin,

16:49.140 --> 16:51.665
or a trombone.

16:51.710 --> 16:55.532
- It seems we are _
both comfortable playing
between conventional notes.

16:55.580 --> 16:58.174
I hear the symphony's

16:58.210 --> 17:00.417
looking for a new trombonist.

17:00.450 --> 17:02.816
- Altogether horrible
what happened.

17:02.850 --> 17:04.511
- Not altogether.

17:04.550 --> 17:07.110
It's an unfortunate way
to leave the symphony, yes,

17:07.160 --> 17:10.129
but I can't help thinking
the orchestra will be better

17:10.160 --> 17:13.049
for it.
- At least the brass section.

17:13.100 --> 17:17.264
What brings you here
looking for gut?

17:17.300 --> 17:21.259
- My harpsichord needs new
strings. It's making
an awful noise.

17:21.300 --> 17:23.302
Perhaps you could help.

17:36.720 --> 17:40.656
(quiet scratching nearby)

17:40.690 --> 17:44.285
(animal chattering)

17:46.630 --> 17:50.054
(loud, rapid scratching)

17:56.570 --> 17:59.164
(scratching continuing)

18:01.840 --> 18:04.673
(chattering)

18:04.710 --> 18:07.144
(scratching continuing)

18:07.180 --> 18:09.171
(chattering)

18:12.690 --> 18:14.681
(scratching and chattering)

18:25.170 --> 18:27.138
- What kind _of animal
was it?

18:27.170 --> 18:30.139
- It might've been
a raccoon.

18:30.170 --> 18:32.263
- Might've been?

18:32.310 --> 18:35.279
- Well, by the time
I knocked a hole in the chimney,

18:35.310 --> 18:37.540
it climbed out the top.

18:39.550 --> 18:41.347
- Well, at least it got out.

18:45.850 --> 18:49.286
- What are you doing out?

18:49.320 --> 18:52.153
- I thought I'd come over,
make some noise,

18:52.190 --> 18:54.829
shoo away any predators
at your door.

18:54.860 --> 18:58.159
It looks like you're making
plenty of noise all by yourself.

19:02.740 --> 19:06.836
- You avoided being in a room
alone with me essentially

19:06.870 --> 19:09.509
since I met you.

19:09.540 --> 19:11.349
You were smooth about it.

19:11.380 --> 19:14.611
- Evidently not smooth enough.
- And now you're making

19:14.650 --> 19:16.345
house calls?

19:18.350 --> 19:21.319
- Just a drive-by
on my way home.

19:21.360 --> 19:24.249
Since you're
not my patient.

19:24.290 --> 19:25.655
- No.

19:25.690 --> 19:27.624
I'm not.

19:45.780 --> 19:47.475
- I-I'm confused.

19:47.520 --> 19:51.240
- You have to stop thinking
so much.

19:54.260 --> 19:57.479
- I can stop the thinking
if we're not...

19:57.530 --> 20:01.250
but if we're...
- Intimate.

20:03.730 --> 20:06.893
- The way that I am
in relationships--

20:06.930 --> 20:09.660
not that this is a relationship;
it's just a kiss.

20:12.270 --> 20:13.771
A great kiss.

20:13.810 --> 20:16.370
But I...

20:16.410 --> 20:18.469
The way that I am isn't

20:18.510 --> 20:21.809
compatible with the way that--
- The way I am.

20:27.490 --> 20:29.378
- I wouldn't be good for you.

20:29.420 --> 20:32.457
You wouldn't be good for me,
and I wouldn't be able

20:32.490 --> 20:34.993
to stop analyzing,
because I have this

20:35.030 --> 20:38.261
professional curiosity
about you and--

20:45.540 --> 20:48.304
- I am not your patient.

20:50.950 --> 20:52.577
- If I were

20:52.610 --> 20:55.875
my patient,
my advice to me...

20:55.920 --> 20:58.388
would be: don't do this.

20:58.420 --> 21:02.550
I have to follow
my own adVIce.

21:11.330 --> 21:14.367
I'm gonna go ahead
and go now.

21:14.400 --> 21:16.391
Goodnight, Will.

21:18.410 --> 21:20.378
(door opening)

21:22.380 --> 21:24.371
(door closing)

21:29.950 --> 21:32.942
(sonata for cello and piano
Playing)

21:35.460 --> 21:38.827
- A late harvest Vidal
from Linden.

21:38.860 --> 21:41.829
- Oh, Virginia.
I thought it was French.

21:41.860 --> 21:44.420
- The Virginia wine revolution
is upon us.

21:46.430 --> 21:48.637
I apologize for being
so blunt, Tobias,

21:48.670 --> 21:50.706
but I have to ask.

21:50.740 --> 21:54.528
Did you kill that trombonist?

21:54.580 --> 21:56.878
- Do you really have to ask?

21:56.910 --> 22:00.368
- No. Just changing the subject.

22:00.420 --> 22:03.344
- Franklyn gave you
my message.

22:03.390 --> 22:06.917
- The murder is being
investigated by the FBI.

22:06.950 --> 22:08.918
They're going to find you.

22:08.960 --> 22:11.383
- Let them.

22:11.430 --> 22:13.398
- You want to get caught?

22:13.430 --> 22:15.523
- I want them to try.

22:15.560 --> 22:17.528
They may investigate me

22:17.570 --> 22:20.061
because I own
a string shop.

22:20.100 --> 22:22.534
They'll send men
to investigate,

22:22.570 --> 22:24.538
and I'll kill them.

22:24.570 --> 22:26.834
Then I'll find Franklyn
and kill him.

22:26.870 --> 22:29.373
Then I would disappear.

22:31.180 --> 22:34.445
- Don't kill Franklyn.
- I've been looking
forward to it.

22:34.480 --> 22:36.038
Actually...

22:38.920 --> 22:41.980
...I was going to kill you.
- Of course you were.

22:42.020 --> 22:43.681
I'm lean.

22:43.730 --> 22:45.823
Lean animals yield
the toughest gut.

22:45.860 --> 22:48.920
What stopped you
from wanting to kill me?

22:48.960 --> 22:51.793
Or have you stopped?

22:51.830 --> 22:56.096
- I stopped after I followed you
one night. Out of town.

22:56.140 --> 22:58.108
To a lonely road.

22:58.140 --> 23:00.131
To a bus yard.

23:08.080 --> 23:10.116
- You're reckless, Tobias.

23:10.150 --> 23:15.178
- I'm not going to tell anyone
what I saw you do and do well.

23:15.220 --> 23:19.122
So my recklessness doesn't
concern you.

23:19.160 --> 23:21.128
- It concerns me

23:21.160 --> 23:24.527
because you won't be drawing
attention just to yourself.

23:34.540 --> 23:36.679
- I could use a friend.

23:36.710 --> 23:39.008
Someone who can understand me.

23:39.050 --> 23:42.679
Who thinks like I do and can see
the world and the people in it

23:42.720 --> 23:44.688
the way I do.

23:44.720 --> 23:46.881
- I know exactly how you feel.

23:46.920 --> 23:49.889
But I don't want
to be your friend.

23:49.920 --> 23:53.458
- Then why did you invite me
here for dinner?

23:53.500 --> 23:56.697
Wasn't just to restring
your harpsichord.

23:56.730 --> 23:58.960
- I was going to kill you.

23:59.000 --> 24:01.889
I didn't poison you,
Tobias.

24:01.940 --> 24:04.431
I wouldn't do that to the food.

24:06.670 --> 24:08.934
(doorbell)

24:10.950 --> 24:13.077
- Expecting someone?

24:13.110 --> 24:15.442
- No.

24:26.230 --> 24:29.119
- Well, I kissed
Alana Bloom.

24:31.670 --> 24:34.230
- Well, come in.

24:34.270 --> 24:36.534
- You have a guest?

24:36.570 --> 24:38.060
- A colleague.

24:38.110 --> 24:41.273
You just missed him.
- Didn't finish his dinner.

24:41.310 --> 24:44.643
- An urgent call of some sort.
He had to leave suddenly.

24:44.680 --> 24:46.102
This benefits you,

24:46.150 --> 24:48.618
because I have dessert for two.

24:52.020 --> 24:53.578
Tell me,

24:53.620 --> 24:55.781
what was_
Alana's reaction?

24:55.820 --> 24:58.880
- She said she wouldn't be good
for me,

24:58.930 --> 25:02.058
and I wouldn't be good for her.

25:02.100 --> 25:04.193
- I don't disagree.

25:04.230 --> 25:07.688
She would feel an obligation
to her field of study
to observe you,

25:07.740 --> 25:09.833
and you would resent her for it.

25:09.870 --> 25:11.838
- I know.
- Wondering then

25:11.870 --> 25:14.668
why you kissed her,
and felt compelled

25:14.710 --> 25:17.031
to drive an hour in the snow
to tell me about it.

25:17.080 --> 25:20.948
- Well, I wanted to kiss her
since I met her. She's
very kissable.

25:20.980 --> 25:23.949
- You waited a long time,

25:23.990 --> 25:26.641
which suggests you were
kissing her for a reason,

25:26.690 --> 25:28.658
in addition to wanting to.

25:28.690 --> 25:32.126
- I heard an animal
trapped in my chimney.

25:32.160 --> 25:33.889
Um...

25:33.930 --> 25:37.718
broke through the wall
to get it out.

25:37.770 --> 25:40.022
Didn't find anything
inside.

25:42.170 --> 25:44.707
Alana showed up,
she looked at me...

25:44.740 --> 25:48.198
I... Maybe her face changed.

25:48.240 --> 25:50.333
I don't know.

25:50.380 --> 25:52.701
But, um, she knew.

25:56.250 --> 25:58.582
- What did she know, Will?

25:58.620 --> 26:01.817
- There was _no animal
in the chimney.

26:01.860 --> 26:03.919
It was only in my head.

26:03.960 --> 26:07.088
I sleepwalk.

26:07.130 --> 26:09.849
I get headaches.

26:09.900 --> 26:11.891
I am hearing things.

26:14.770 --> 26:17.261
I feel unstable.

26:17.300 --> 26:19.359
- That's why you kissed her.

26:19.410 --> 26:21.332
A clutch for balance.

26:24.150 --> 26:27.369
You said yourself
what you do is not good for you.

26:27.410 --> 26:30.049
- Well, unfortunately,
I am good for it.

26:30.080 --> 26:33.789
- Are you still hearing
this killer's serenade

26:33.820 --> 26:35.651
behind your eyes?

26:35.690 --> 26:37.749
(Will chuckles.)
- Well, it's our song.

26:54.180 --> 26:58.139
- I hesitate telling you this,
as it borders on a violation
of doctor-patient

26:58.180 --> 27:00.171
confidentiality.

27:03.850 --> 27:06.341
A patient told me today
he suspects a friend of his may

27:06.390 --> 27:08.881
be involved with the murder
at the symphony.

27:11.330 --> 27:13.127
- Right, um...

27:16.030 --> 27:18.999
Um... what did he say
about his friend?

27:19.030 --> 27:22.090
- He owns a_music store
in Baltimore,

27:22.140 --> 27:24.700
specializing
in string instruments.

27:24.740 --> 27:27.061
Perhaps
you should interview him.

27:29.080 --> 27:30.741
- Yeah.

27:35.320 --> 27:39.211
- For the first time
in a long while, I see
a possibility of friendship.

27:39.250 --> 27:41.457
- Is there someone new
in your life?

27:41.490 --> 27:44.357
- I met a man much like myself.

27:44.390 --> 27:47.257
Same hobbies, same worldviews,

27:47.290 --> 27:50.794
but I'm not interested in being
his friend. I'm curious
about him,

27:50.830 --> 27:53.196
and that got me curious
about friendship.

27:53.230 --> 27:56.461
- Whose friendship
are you considering?

27:56.500 --> 27:59.367
- Oddly enough, a colleague
and a patient,

27:59.410 --> 28:02.231
not unlike how I'm a colleague
and a patient of yours.

28:02.280 --> 28:04.145
We've discussed him before.

28:04.180 --> 28:06.239
- Will Graham.
- He's nothing like me.

28:06.280 --> 28:09.909
We see the world
in different ways,

28:09.950 --> 28:12.919
yet he can
assume my point of view.

28:12.950 --> 28:16.784
- By profiling
the criminally insane.

28:16.820 --> 28:19.721
- As good a demonstration
as any.

28:19.760 --> 28:22.399
I find it reassuring.

28:22.430 --> 28:25.422
- It's nice _
when someone sees us, Hannibal.

28:25.470 --> 28:29.497
Or has the ability
to see us.

28:29.540 --> 28:31.838
It requires trust.

28:31.870 --> 28:35.476
Trust is difficult for you.

28:35.510 --> 28:38.070
- You've helped me
to better understand what I want

28:38.110 --> 28:40.977
in a friendship,
and what I don't.

28:41.020 --> 28:43.841
- Someone worthy
of your friendship.

28:43.890 --> 28:46.188
- Yes.
- You spend

28:46.220 --> 28:49.109
a lot of time
building walls, Hannibal.

28:49.160 --> 28:51.253
It's natural to want to see

28:51.290 --> 28:54.453
if someone is clever enough
to climb over them.

28:59.200 --> 29:01.168
- JSB's Suite No.1.

29:01.200 --> 29:03.168
(door chiming)

29:03.200 --> 29:06.328
- Special Agent Will Graham
with the FBI.

29:06.370 --> 29:09.032
Are you the owner?
- Yes. Tobias Budge.

29:09.080 --> 29:12.277
I'm just showing one
of my students out.
Can I have a moment?

29:12.310 --> 29:14.449
Adagio.

29:14.480 --> 29:16.778
For Saturday.

29:16.820 --> 29:19.846
(door chiming)

29:19.890 --> 29:22.188
What can I help you with?

29:22.220 --> 29:25.348
- We're investigating the death
of Douglas Wilson. He was--

29:25.390 --> 29:26.948
- The trombonist.

29:26.990 --> 29:28.958
- That's right.
Did you know him?

29:29.000 --> 29:30.194
- I was aware of him.

29:30.230 --> 29:32.892
Baltimore is a small town,

29:32.930 --> 29:36.969
and the cultural arts community
is an even smaller one.

29:37.000 --> 29:39.230
- Well, that's why
we're here, Mr. Budge.

29:39.270 --> 29:41.807
- I hear someone_cut_his throat
and tried to play it With a bow.

29:43.610 --> 29:45.475
- Why do you say "try"?

29:45.510 --> 29:48.308
- The strings have
to be treated.

29:48.350 --> 29:51.012
You can't just
open somebody up and draw a bow

29:51.050 --> 29:52.688
across their innards
and expect to produce a sound.

29:55.360 --> 30:00.320
- The vocal chords were
chemically treated, uh, Similar
to how catgut string is treated.

30:00.360 --> 30:03.921
We kept those details
out of the press.

30:03.970 --> 30:07.019
- Looking for someone who knows
how to manufacture gut strings?

30:07.070 --> 30:09.038
- Anybody leap to mind?

30:09.070 --> 30:11.061
- Mine are imported
from Italy.

30:11.110 --> 30:13.066
Best catgut is.

30:13.110 --> 30:15.078
The string section
of the Baltimore Metropolitan

30:15.110 --> 30:17.237
Orchestra refuses
to play anything else.

30:17.280 --> 30:18.838
- More authentic.

30:18.880 --> 30:21.519
- A richer, darker sound.

30:21.550 --> 30:25.008
Allows music
to say what words can't.

30:25.050 --> 30:27.280
(tires screeching)
(crash)

30:27.320 --> 30:30.414
(shrieking and moaning)
(car horn honking)

30:30.460 --> 30:33.850
- Something wrong?

30:33.900 --> 30:37.119
- Didn't you hear that?

30:37.160 --> 30:41.039
- I didn't hear anything.

30:41.070 --> 30:43.129
- Excuse me a minute.

30:51.080 --> 30:53.275
(animal moaning)

30:59.420 --> 31:02.287
(animal shrieking)

31:04.290 --> 31:07.157
(animal shrieking)

31:13.400 --> 31:15.459
Sorry about that.

31:22.480 --> 31:24.107
Officers?

31:26.110 --> 31:27.509
Officers?

31:48.700 --> 31:52.136
I need ERT at Chordophone
Strings, downtown Baltimore.

31:52.170 --> 31:53.603
Officer down.

33:04.480 --> 33:06.471
(scratching nearby)

33:17.190 --> 33:20.682
(scratching continuing)

33:52.260 --> 33:54.296
(gunshot)

33:54.330 --> 33:56.321
(high-pitched whine)

33:59.330 --> 34:01.662
(faint gunshots)

34:04.170 --> 34:07.207
(faint sirens)

34:10.640 --> 34:13.074
- Nine.

34:13.110 --> 34:15.078
Nine times.

34:15.120 --> 34:18.180
I can count on two hands
the number of times I've been

34:18.220 --> 34:20.688
dumped by a psychiatrist.
- I'm sorry, Franklyn,

34:20.720 --> 34:23.382
but I think you should
see another doctor.

34:23.420 --> 34:25.388
- You're giving me a referral?
- Yes, I am.

34:25.430 --> 34:28.399
- You were a referral!
- I am also a part
of the problem.

34:28.430 --> 34:30.728
- You focus too much

34:30.760 --> 34:34.230
on your therapist,
and not enough on your therapy.

34:34.270 --> 34:37.865
- You lost respect for me
because I wouldn't

34:37.900 --> 34:41.631
report Tobias, didn't you?
- (Tobias): Report Tobias
for what?

34:44.810 --> 34:46.368
- Tobias.

34:46.410 --> 34:48.617
- I came to say goodbye,
Franklyn.

34:48.650 --> 34:51.118
- What do you mean,
goodbye?

34:51.150 --> 34:52.879
Oh, my god.

34:52.920 --> 34:56.378
Oh, my god, is that your blood?
- Ijust killed two men.

34:56.420 --> 34:59.787
The police came to question me
about the murder.

35:03.800 --> 35:06.769
- OK... you have

35:06.800 --> 35:08.836
to give yourself up
right now.

35:08.870 --> 35:12.328
This plane is going down.

35:12.370 --> 35:14.679
Let it have
a controlled descent.

35:14.710 --> 35:16.837
We can get you back up
in the air again.

35:16.880 --> 35:19.269
There's rehabilitation
for everyone.

35:19.310 --> 35:21.676
- Franklyn, I want you
to leave now.

35:21.720 --> 35:24.644
- Stay right where you are,
Franklyn.

35:26.650 --> 35:28.914
- You've done

35:28.960 --> 35:31.326
a horrible thing,

35:31.360 --> 35:34.727
and... I know...

35:34.760 --> 35:37.399
that you wish to God
that you didn't.

35:37.430 --> 35:39.728
But you did.

35:39.770 --> 35:42.534
And there's nothing you can do
to change that.

35:42.570 --> 35:46.734
Only thing you can change is
your future.

35:46.770 --> 35:48.499
Right?

35:50.510 --> 35:52.774
No? You're probably scared.

35:52.810 --> 35:54.914
You probably feel

35:54.950 --> 35:58.181
like you're all alone.
- I'm not alone.

35:58.220 --> 36:01.519
- That's right.
You're not alone. Nothing has

36:01.560 --> 36:04.654
happened in our relationship
that you and I can't--
(neck breaking)

36:16.670 --> 36:18.831
- I was looking forward
to that.

36:18.870 --> 36:21.771
- I saved you the trouble.

37:07.620 --> 37:09.315
Ah!

37:17.030 --> 37:19.260
- Ah!

37:45.590 --> 37:47.581
(arm breaking)
Ahhh!

37:47.630 --> 37:50.622
(Tobias yelling in pain)

37:56.470 --> 37:58.938
(coughing)

38:33.110 --> 38:37.376
(Goldberg Variations: "Aria"
by JS Bach)

39:05.870 --> 39:10.375
(keyboard music fading out)
- I was worried you were dead.

39:13.750 --> 39:15.479
- Tobias Budge

39:15.520 --> 39:19.115
killed two
Baltimore Police officers,

39:19.150 --> 39:21.118
nearly killed
an FBI special agent,

39:21.150 --> 39:24.449
and after all of that,
his first stop

39:24.490 --> 39:26.685
is here, at your office.

39:26.730 --> 39:29.893
- He came to kill my patient.

39:29.930 --> 39:34.492
- Your patient. Is that
who Budge was serenading?

39:34.540 --> 39:37.464
- I don't know.

39:37.500 --> 39:39.832
Franklyn knew more

39:39.870 --> 39:42.532
than he was telling me.
He told Mr. Budge

39:42.580 --> 39:44.639
that he didn't have
to kill anymore.

39:47.510 --> 39:50.479
And then he broke Franklyn's
neck, and then he attacked me.

39:50.520 --> 39:52.579
- You killed him?

39:54.590 --> 39:55.955
- Yeah.

39:55.990 --> 39:59.084
- Could Franklyn have been
involved

39:59.130 --> 40:01.894
in whatever Budge was doing?

40:01.930 --> 40:06.560
- I thought
this was a simple matter
of poor choice in friends.

40:06.600 --> 40:08.898
- This doesn't fee! simple
to me.

40:21.520 --> 40:23.147
- I feel like I've...

40:23.180 --> 40:25.614
dragged you into my world.

40:25.650 --> 40:27.447
- I got here on my own.

40:27.490 --> 40:31.153
But I appreciate
the company.

40:42.800 --> 40:45.200
I'm going to start
seeing patients again.

40:48.070 --> 40:53.576
It's strange, thinking about
going back to daily practice.

40:53.610 --> 40:56.647
- Well, it's good
you stepped away--

40:56.680 --> 40:59.547
even if it was
only for a few days.

40:59.590 --> 41:03.082
- Patients will sit
where Franklyn died.

41:05.090 --> 41:08.628
I will sit where I almost died,
and I will offer therapy.

41:11.630 --> 41:13.962
It's easy to understand
why you retired after you were

41:14.000 --> 41:15.695
attacked.

41:17.700 --> 41:20.931
Will you ever feel comfortable
returning to psychiatric work?

41:20.970 --> 41:24.872
- This is psychiatric work.

41:24.910 --> 41:27.606
- One patient isn't
a practice.

41:30.750 --> 41:33.014
- I can't help

41:33.050 --> 41:36.713
feeling responsible
for what happened to Franklyn.

41:36.760 --> 41:41.254
- Every person has
an intrinsic responsibility
for their own life, Hannibal.

41:44.030 --> 41:47.158
No one else can_ take on
that responSIbility.

41:47.200 --> 41:49.191
Not even you.

41:55.080 --> 41:57.036
- Did you take responsibility

41:57.080 --> 41:59.139
when you were attacked
by your patient?

42:01.210 --> 42:03.644
- Yes.

42:03.680 --> 42:07.844
But I don't take
responsibility for his death.

42:15.330 --> 42:17.059
- Nor should you.
