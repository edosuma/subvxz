00:29.663 --> 00:30.729
Africa again?

00:30.765 --> 00:32.898
Kate. You scared me.

00:32.933 --> 00:34.566
You know,
you do that a lot.

00:34.602 --> 00:36.235
Well, occupational
hazard.

00:36.270 --> 00:38.103
We work at
a travel magazine

00:38.139 --> 00:40.272
and we're stuck in these
tiny little cubicles.

00:40.307 --> 00:41.640
I mean, come on,

00:41.675 --> 00:43.242
can't you picture it?

00:43.277 --> 00:46.178
Me, in a safari hat,
one of those cute little vests,

00:46.213 --> 00:48.247
and those amazing
knee-high boots,

00:48.282 --> 00:50.616
just hanging
with the elephants.

00:50.651 --> 00:52.684
Mm, if only in your dreams.

00:52.720 --> 00:54.031
Well, at least
I can dream, can't I?

00:54.055 --> 00:56.088
Do you really want
to quit your job?

00:56.123 --> 00:58.123
No... well, no.

00:58.159 --> 01:01.360
But I am planning my escape
from this copy editing desk.

01:01.395 --> 01:03.629
I am a writer, remember?

01:03.664 --> 01:05.864
At least you're editing
the "World's Best" articles.

01:05.900 --> 01:08.267
Could be worse.
Could be me.

01:08.302 --> 01:10.836
Apparently, this was
also a landfill.

01:10.871 --> 01:13.439
Plastic is single-handedly
destroying our planet.

01:15.743 --> 01:17.242
Okay. Everybody, gather around.

01:19.146 --> 01:21.046
So, it's been a great quarter,

01:21.082 --> 01:22.481
and that is thanks,
in large part,

01:22.516 --> 01:24.216
to the incredible
hard work and dedication

01:24.251 --> 01:25.317
of you fine people.

01:25.352 --> 01:27.686
But... as the magazine grows,

01:27.721 --> 01:29.521
so does our audience.

01:29.557 --> 01:31.223
Which is why, this year...

01:31.258 --> 01:32.791
<i>Around the World Travel</i>

01:32.827 --> 01:34.660
is looking to expand
our travel writing team.

01:34.695 --> 01:36.695
We're hoping to find

01:36.730 --> 01:39.164
a fresh voice,
a new perspective,

01:39.200 --> 01:42.201
so I am accepting story pitches
from anyone on staff.

01:44.171 --> 01:45.204
Now...

01:45.239 --> 01:47.139
here's the exciting part.

01:47.174 --> 01:50.476
Whoever writes
the best travel article

01:50.511 --> 01:53.312
wins a first-class ticket
to anywhere in the world...

01:54.782 --> 01:58.517
...And the cover story
in our next issue,

01:58.552 --> 02:02.154
as well as an ongoing position
as a staff travel writer.

02:02.189 --> 02:03.989
Deadline is a week from Monday.

02:04.024 --> 02:06.592
Here's your chance.
Get in there!

02:06.627 --> 02:07.860
Oh, Kate,
the last time

02:07.895 --> 02:09.193
I pitched a story
to McHugh,

02:09.229 --> 02:10.662
he gave me the old

02:10.698 --> 02:12.898
"That's not quite
right for us, Alex,"

02:12.933 --> 02:14.032
and sent me
back to my desk.

02:14.068 --> 02:15.068
That was then!

02:15.102 --> 02:16.913
You heard him, they're looking
for a new writer.

02:16.937 --> 02:18.704
Second chances.

02:18.739 --> 02:20.606
Alex, go, go, go!

02:20.641 --> 02:21.607
You really think so?

02:21.642 --> 02:22.574
Yeah.

02:22.610 --> 02:24.409
Whew. Okay.

02:26.814 --> 02:29.214
Mr. McHugh? Sir?
Do you have a moment?

02:29.250 --> 02:30.616
Walk with me, Alex.

02:30.651 --> 02:32.051
I just think it's
such a great idea,

02:32.086 --> 02:33.296
what you're doing,
about the contest.

02:33.320 --> 02:35.521
Thank you.

02:37.158 --> 02:38.390
Is that all?

02:38.425 --> 02:39.725
Uh, n-no.

02:39.760 --> 02:41.093
I would love to enter it.

02:41.128 --> 02:42.928
As a writer.

02:42.963 --> 02:44.040
Great.
What'd you have in mind?

02:44.064 --> 02:46.098
In mind?
Uh... well...

02:46.133 --> 02:47.232
Off the top of my head,

02:47.268 --> 02:48.367
I could, uh...

02:49.770 --> 02:51.236
I could write about

02:51.272 --> 02:54.573
this romantic New England B&B
that I went to recently,

02:54.608 --> 02:58.143
that is classic and decadent,
and, um...

02:58.179 --> 02:59.978
did I mention romantic?

03:00.014 --> 03:02.581
It's nice to see you
taking initiative, Alex,

03:02.616 --> 03:05.984
and you're a very valuable asset
to our copy editing team,

03:06.020 --> 03:08.987
but travel writers,
they go off the beaten path,

03:09.023 --> 03:10.989
they come outside
of their comfort zone.

03:11.025 --> 03:12.424
You really think that's you?

03:12.459 --> 03:13.926
Yes, sir.

03:13.961 --> 03:16.161
I mean, pretty much...

03:16.197 --> 03:17.563
...ish?

03:17.598 --> 03:19.097
Travel writers
are courageous, Alex,

03:19.133 --> 03:20.032
they'll try anything.

03:20.067 --> 03:22.901
Each story reveals
a part of their soul,

03:22.937 --> 03:25.003
taking the reader
on an inner- and outer-journey.

03:25.039 --> 03:28.140
So...
not a romantic B&B then?

03:28.175 --> 03:29.808
Think bigger.

03:29.843 --> 03:32.110
"Bigger."

03:39.787 --> 03:41.420
There you two are!

03:41.455 --> 03:43.188
Join us.

03:43.224 --> 03:44.923
We have been summoned.

03:46.393 --> 03:48.293
Mother,
you look lovely.

03:48.329 --> 03:49.494
Oh, thank you,
dear.

03:49.530 --> 03:52.097
Alex, so nice to see you.

03:52.132 --> 03:54.499
Nice to see you, too,
Mrs. Kane, Mr. Kane.

03:54.535 --> 03:55.968
Thank you so much
for having me.

03:56.003 --> 03:57.102
Of course.

03:57.137 --> 03:58.370
I always say,
call me "Bitty".

03:58.405 --> 04:00.339
Right. Sorry. Bitty.

04:00.374 --> 04:02.507
As I was saying...

04:02.543 --> 04:05.344
the Raven's House
is looking to expand

04:05.379 --> 04:06.945
its charity program
this year.

04:06.981 --> 04:09.514
And, between that
and the Kanes' Foundation,

04:09.550 --> 04:15.320
we've raised nearly $2 million
for "Paws for Peace."

04:15.356 --> 04:16.887
Wonderful!

04:16.923 --> 04:20.058
Alex, you should really
volunteer with us.

04:20.094 --> 04:22.327
You've been
such a big help in the past.

04:22.363 --> 04:23.406
You know
I'd love to, Bitty,

04:23.430 --> 04:25.697
thank you so much
for asking,

04:25.733 --> 04:26.865
but there's actually

04:26.900 --> 04:30.235
this opportunity
coming up at work.

04:30.271 --> 04:33.372
My editor at <i> Around</i>
<i>The World Travel</i> magazine

04:33.407 --> 04:34.806
announced
this contest today.

04:34.842 --> 04:38.543
They're looking
for a new travel writer.

04:38.579 --> 04:40.679
A contest? To travel?

04:40.714 --> 04:42.180
As a job?

04:42.216 --> 04:45.584
Yeah. I mean, I still have
to apply and everything,

04:45.619 --> 04:47.986
and who knows
if I even stand a chance,

04:48.022 --> 04:51.657
but I mean, traveling the world
as a writer,

04:51.692 --> 04:53.692
inspiring people
through my words, it's...

04:53.727 --> 04:55.527
it's a dream job.

04:55.562 --> 04:57.062
Well, apply you should.

04:58.232 --> 05:00.198
Yes. Well...

05:00.234 --> 05:01.500
this might be
a good time

05:01.535 --> 05:03.669
to make your
announcement, Barton.

05:04.738 --> 05:05.704
What?

05:05.739 --> 05:08.540
May I have
everyone's attention?

05:09.743 --> 05:11.410
I've been wanting

05:11.445 --> 05:13.612
to create more
stability in my life,

05:13.647 --> 05:16.882
Move things
to the next level.

05:19.820 --> 05:23.255
I'm thrilled to announce...

05:23.290 --> 05:25.624
Barton has been
promoted to partner.

05:29.229 --> 05:30.395
Thank you.
Thank you, all.

05:31.598 --> 05:33.732
That's just so...

05:33.767 --> 05:35.033
Amazing. Right?

05:35.069 --> 05:36.568
...Amazing, yes.

05:37.938 --> 05:39.404
Congratulations.

05:39.440 --> 05:41.373
I knew you'd be thrilled.

05:41.408 --> 05:43.842
You deserve it.

05:47.181 --> 05:49.448
Hey, Kate?

05:49.483 --> 05:51.249
What is this called?

05:51.285 --> 05:52.384
What are we looking at?

05:52.419 --> 05:53.785
That, there.

05:53.821 --> 05:55.620
Mm. I don't know.

05:55.656 --> 05:57.055
Exhilaration?

05:57.091 --> 05:58.323
Yes! That's it!

05:58.359 --> 05:59.424
Thank you.

05:59.460 --> 06:00.559
I don't have that.

06:00.594 --> 06:03.328
Has my life become complacent?

06:03.364 --> 06:05.230
Uh, I wouldn't say complacent.

06:05.265 --> 06:07.632
It's more like stable
and predictable.

06:07.668 --> 06:08.500
Are these the shots

06:08.535 --> 06:10.602
for the new
"World's Best" article?

06:10.637 --> 06:12.437
Mm-hmm.
I love the photographer.

06:12.473 --> 06:14.239
He captures something.

06:14.274 --> 06:15.974
This... This feeling.

06:16.009 --> 06:17.676
I can't really explain it.

06:17.711 --> 06:19.611
Who is he?
Is he handsome?

06:19.646 --> 06:21.480
The only thing I know
about Cole Taylor

06:21.515 --> 06:22.826
is that he lives
in Ridgeline Resort

06:22.850 --> 06:23.949
in Colorado.

06:23.984 --> 06:25.095
He must have
a Facebook account.

06:25.119 --> 06:26.251
No. I checked.

06:26.286 --> 06:28.854
He has a website,
but other than that,

06:28.889 --> 06:30.689
no online presence,
no photos, nothing.

06:30.724 --> 06:32.090
Sounds like a real recluse.

06:32.126 --> 06:34.192
You know, I bet
he has a wilderness beard.

06:34.228 --> 06:35.427
All enigmas
have beards.

06:36.730 --> 06:37.829
So someone's a recluse

06:37.865 --> 06:39.709
just because they don't have
a social media profile?

06:39.733 --> 06:40.766
Pretty much.

06:42.536 --> 06:45.103
Oh, it's 3:00 p.m.
Shall we?

06:45.139 --> 06:47.239
We shall.

06:54.715 --> 06:56.281
Oh, hey, Cole.

06:56.316 --> 06:58.717
What are you doing?

06:58.752 --> 07:00.552
Uh, we need to change
things up a little,

07:00.587 --> 07:02.521
for your Winter Walk
meet-and-greet.

07:02.556 --> 07:03.822
What do you mean?

07:03.857 --> 07:05.857
No, no, no, no, no.
We agreed...

07:05.893 --> 07:07.459
I'm the silent partner.

07:07.494 --> 07:09.327
You do the talking
and the selling.

07:09.363 --> 07:10.962
There will be no "meet"
or "greet".

07:10.998 --> 07:12.564
Cole, I haven't sold
anything in weeks,

07:12.599 --> 07:14.332
and people are requesting
new pieces,

07:14.368 --> 07:15.434
which is you.

07:15.469 --> 07:17.046
With all the commercial work,
I haven't had time.

07:17.070 --> 07:19.070
Fair enough,

07:19.106 --> 07:21.673
but we can't keep working
on the same old material.

07:21.708 --> 07:22.908
What happened
to the guy

07:22.943 --> 07:25.510
who needed to "capture
a moment in time"?

07:25.546 --> 07:26.445
Capturing a moment in time

07:26.480 --> 07:29.181
is not just about
a beautiful photo, Max.

07:29.216 --> 07:30.248
You gotta be inspired,

07:30.284 --> 07:32.617
you can't just
force inspiration.

07:33.787 --> 07:36.488
Anyway...

07:37.691 --> 07:39.724
How does it
happen so fast?

07:39.760 --> 07:40.826
One minute,

07:40.861 --> 07:42.038
you're reaching
for your dreams,

07:42.062 --> 07:43.995
and the next,
you're 29 and coasting,

07:44.031 --> 07:46.064
everything is easy
and safe,

07:46.099 --> 07:47.899
and the most exciting
part of your day

07:47.935 --> 07:49.868
is getting lattes
at 3:00 p.m.

07:49.903 --> 07:51.069
I mean, don't
get me wrong,

07:51.104 --> 07:52.604
I have a great job.

07:52.639 --> 07:55.373
But I majored
in journalism in college.

07:55.409 --> 07:57.843
When did I become
a bystander in my own life?

07:57.878 --> 07:59.211
Well, that's just
who you are.

07:59.246 --> 08:01.213
You're not a risk-taker,
and that's okay.

08:01.248 --> 08:03.081
Hey! I got double whip
on my latte today.

08:03.116 --> 08:05.050
Yeah,
first time ever.

08:05.085 --> 08:07.686
It's true. You know...

08:07.721 --> 08:08.965
ever since I fell
down the stairs

08:08.989 --> 08:09.955
when I was four years old,

08:09.990 --> 08:12.090
my mom's had me in
hypothetical bubble wrap.

08:12.125 --> 08:15.293
I'm a low-risk dreamer
with nothing to show for it.

08:15.329 --> 08:17.462
No wonder
Barton has zero faith in me.

08:17.498 --> 08:19.564
Hey, entering
that contest isn't safe.

08:19.600 --> 08:20.866
Okay? It takes
real guts.

08:20.901 --> 08:23.134
If I can figure out
what to write about.

08:23.170 --> 08:24.135
I don't know
how I'm gonna

08:24.171 --> 08:25.371
get McHugh
to take me seriously

08:25.405 --> 08:26.771
as a travel writer.

08:26.807 --> 08:27.939
Oh, hey, look.

08:27.975 --> 08:30.141
That's Cole Taylor's
photo.

08:30.177 --> 08:32.910
For an enigma,
he sure is everywhere.

08:32.946 --> 08:35.547
At least his photos are.

08:35.582 --> 08:37.948
Maybe they're trying
to tell me something.

08:37.985 --> 08:40.585
To go skiing?
I doubt it.

08:42.956 --> 08:45.624
No, Kate! That's it!

08:45.659 --> 08:47.325
I know what
I'm gonna write about.

08:47.361 --> 08:50.128
McHugh is going to love it!

08:50.163 --> 08:51.463
Alex! Wait!

08:51.498 --> 08:53.164
It's not a good idea
to run with coffee!

08:53.200 --> 08:54.799
What can I do for you, Alex?

08:54.835 --> 08:56.134
Well, sir,
I thought a lot

08:56.169 --> 08:56.935
about what you said,

08:56.970 --> 08:59.905
and I am proposing
that I travel

08:59.940 --> 09:01.306
to the wilds
of the Rocky Mountains

09:01.341 --> 09:02.440
and write an article

09:02.476 --> 09:06.311
on nature and extreme sports
photographer Cole Taylor.

09:07.481 --> 09:08.780
His work is amazing.

09:11.652 --> 09:12.652
Oh...

09:14.121 --> 09:15.654
There we go.
His work is amazing.

09:15.689 --> 09:17.289
They call him
the next Ansel Adams,

09:17.324 --> 09:19.925
yet he hasn't created
a new collection in two years.

09:19.960 --> 09:21.293
He really is quite the mystery.

09:21.328 --> 09:22.694
Perfect subject, right?

09:22.729 --> 09:25.797
Well, I mean,
the photos are wonderful,

09:25.832 --> 09:28.533
but if he's so elusive,
how are you gonna find him?

09:28.569 --> 09:31.269
He lives at
Ridgeline Resort in Colorado.

09:31.305 --> 09:33.939
I was thinking
I could go undercover.

09:33.974 --> 09:36.675
You, in the world
of extreme sports?

09:36.710 --> 09:40.045
Alex, and I mean this with
all the kindness in the world,

09:40.080 --> 09:42.213
but you're a complete klutz.

09:42.249 --> 09:43.782
No, I'm not!

09:46.086 --> 09:47.519
Coffee.

09:47.554 --> 09:49.854
Well, maybe just a little bit,

09:49.890 --> 09:52.524
but that has nothing to do
with my ability to write.

09:52.559 --> 09:54.826
Actually...
this is a great idea.

09:54.861 --> 09:56.461
Thank you.

09:56.496 --> 09:58.229
You should write it
in first person

09:58.265 --> 09:59.842
from the prospective
of a non-adventurer,

09:59.866 --> 10:02.634
and in one week,

10:02.669 --> 10:04.836
you try every extreme sport
that they have there.

10:04.871 --> 10:06.137
I'm sorry, what?

10:06.173 --> 10:07.472
Well, you wanted a story.
Right?

10:07.507 --> 10:08.707
Well, this is it.

10:08.742 --> 10:11.209
But what about
Cole Taylor, sir?

10:11.244 --> 10:13.545
You're a travel writer,
not an investigative journalist.

10:13.580 --> 10:15.313
This story
should be about you.

10:15.349 --> 10:17.682
The deadline
is a week from Monday.

10:17.718 --> 10:19.217
You'd better get going.

10:19.252 --> 10:21.586
That is a...
That is a great idea.

10:21.622 --> 10:25.724
Thank you. Mr. McHugh.
You will not regret this.

10:31.198 --> 10:32.764
Extreme sports?

10:32.799 --> 10:34.733
Alex, do you even know
what that means?

10:34.768 --> 10:36.835
No, but I am
an excellent researcher.

10:36.870 --> 10:38.281
Pretty sure
that's not the same thing.

10:38.305 --> 10:40.238
But I believe in you.

10:40.273 --> 10:43.408
Thank you. Mr. McHugh thinks
it's gonna be great

10:43.443 --> 10:45.176
Now I have the entire
flight to Denver

10:45.212 --> 10:47.345
to become an expert
on all things extreme.

10:47.381 --> 10:49.914
Uh, can you...

10:49.950 --> 10:52.117
can you cover for me on
"World's Best" while I'm away?

10:52.152 --> 10:53.618
Yes!

10:53.654 --> 10:55.487
I'm no longer
the "World's Worst"!

10:56.990 --> 10:58.790
Oh, and Alex?

10:58.825 --> 11:00.792
Be a warrior, not a worrier.

11:00.827 --> 11:03.194
Right.

11:05.999 --> 11:07.477
<i>I'm heading
to the airport now.</i>

11:07.501 --> 11:09.434
You're actually doing this?

11:09.469 --> 11:11.736
Yep! The deadline
is next Monday,

11:11.772 --> 11:14.806
so that gives me

11:14.841 --> 11:17.776
seven days to face my fears
and...

11:17.811 --> 11:19.477
And write this story.

11:19.513 --> 11:20.478
I thought we'd go away
this weekend.

11:20.514 --> 11:22.714
You and me, the Berkshires?

11:22.749 --> 11:25.784
Barton, you're not
making this any easier.

11:25.819 --> 11:27.052
No, I-I need to do this.

11:27.087 --> 11:29.788
For myself, for my career,
for us.

11:29.823 --> 11:30.889
It's my big chance.

11:30.924 --> 11:34.125
I finally get to step
outside of my comfort zone.

11:34.161 --> 11:36.728
Okay. One week,
you'll be back?

11:36.763 --> 11:37.595
Then I'm back.

11:37.631 --> 11:39.264
<i>All right.</i>

11:39.299 --> 11:41.099
<i>Knock 'em dead, babe.</i>

11:41.134 --> 11:43.835
Maybe we don't mention death

11:43.870 --> 11:45.637
when I'm about to go do
extreme sports?

11:45.672 --> 11:47.572
Right, sorry.

11:47.607 --> 11:49.407
Just please be safe.

11:49.443 --> 11:51.743
Safe, I will be.

11:53.146 --> 11:54.879
I hope.

12:05.158 --> 12:07.959
"I'm a warrior, not a worrier."

12:10.831 --> 12:13.164
What was that?

12:18.405 --> 12:20.705
My mechanic thinks
it's the axle.

12:20.741 --> 12:22.941
Now, the tow truck
driver's swamped,

12:22.976 --> 12:25.276
but he should be here
in a few hours.

12:25.312 --> 12:27.011
A few hours?

12:27.047 --> 12:28.213
Sorry, miss,

12:28.248 --> 12:30.215
but, luckily,
if you're in a hurry,

12:30.250 --> 12:32.317
the resort is just
a mile up the road.

12:39.926 --> 12:41.860
"Don't be complacent,"
they said.

12:41.895 --> 12:43.795
"Go on an adventure,"
they said.

12:49.436 --> 12:53.371
Hi, Kate.
Yeah, I'm here.

12:53.406 --> 12:55.507
<i>Okay, good.
Just checking.</i>

12:55.542 --> 12:58.510
Yup. But I'm on foot.

12:58.545 --> 13:01.846
<i>I don't understand.
Are you on the highway?</i>

13:03.116 --> 13:05.416
Kate, I think
there's a man following me.

13:05.452 --> 13:07.418
<i>Did you
say "a van"?</i>

13:07.454 --> 13:09.420
A mountain man
in a Jeep.

13:09.456 --> 13:11.256
I gotta go, okay?
I gotta go.

13:11.291 --> 13:12.757
He's gonna kidnap me,

13:12.793 --> 13:14.270
he's gonna throw
my bag in the bushes,

13:14.294 --> 13:15.974
and no one's ever gonna
be able to find me.

13:18.031 --> 13:19.364
Excuse me, ma'am?

13:19.399 --> 13:21.065
Need a ride?

13:21.101 --> 13:23.835
I'm good, thanks!

13:23.870 --> 13:25.069
I'm going the same way.

13:25.105 --> 13:26.538
Why not?

13:26.573 --> 13:30.842
Just get into a Jeep
with a complete stranger.

13:30.877 --> 13:32.844
You sure?
'Cause that bag looks heavy.

13:32.879 --> 13:35.079
It's good
for the cardio.

13:35.115 --> 13:39.384
Okay, suit yourself.

13:39.419 --> 13:41.419
Good luck with the bears.

13:42.889 --> 13:44.722
Bears?

13:46.726 --> 13:49.794
Welcome to Ridgeline Resort.
How may I help you?

13:49.830 --> 13:52.564
Hi. Checking in.
Alex Burns.

13:52.599 --> 13:54.799
Yes. I see we have you

13:54.835 --> 13:57.402
in the "Idyllic Suite"
with a mountain view.

13:57.437 --> 13:58.870
Sounds idyllic.

13:58.905 --> 14:00.605
You came
at the perfect time, too.

14:00.640 --> 14:02.073
"Winter Walk"
starts in a few days.

14:02.108 --> 14:03.474
Winter Walk?

14:03.510 --> 14:04.709
Local artists
open their shops

14:04.744 --> 14:06.377
with hot drinks
and treats.

14:06.413 --> 14:08.224
It's a great way to connect
with the community,

14:08.248 --> 14:09.314
raise money for charity,

14:09.349 --> 14:11.316
and celebrate
Ridgeline artists.

14:11.351 --> 14:14.619
Artists, like...
Cole Taylor?

14:14.654 --> 14:16.487
Exactly.
Cole sells his work

14:16.523 --> 14:18.756
out of the Ridgeline
Art Gallery.

14:18.792 --> 14:22.760
Huh. I, uh... I thought
that he was a recluse.

14:22.796 --> 14:24.062
Not really.

14:24.097 --> 14:25.897
In fact, with this fresh snow,
I'm sure

14:25.932 --> 14:27.632
you'll see Cole
up on the mountain.

14:27.667 --> 14:29.167
Here's your key.

14:29.202 --> 14:31.002
You'll want to head
out the front door,

14:31.037 --> 14:32.770
and head north,
up the path.

14:32.806 --> 14:34.417
Can I just leave my luggage
with the bellman?

14:34.441 --> 14:37.408
Unfortunately,
we don't have one.

14:37.444 --> 14:40.245
But it's just a short
jaunt up the nature path.

14:40.280 --> 14:41.613
Enjoy your stay.

14:41.648 --> 14:43.581
Okay. Great. Thank you.

14:57.163 --> 15:02.233
"The serene nature path
up to my cabin welcomed me."

15:11.311 --> 15:13.111
Hello?

15:13.146 --> 15:14.178
Alex, how're the slopes?

15:14.214 --> 15:17.782
Mr. McHugh! Hi, sir.
Yes, uh...

15:17.817 --> 15:18.750
Good.

15:18.785 --> 15:20.852
It's funny that you should
call right now.

15:20.887 --> 15:22.865
I'm actually just about to head
out on my first excursion.

15:22.889 --> 15:25.023
Excellent.
Have fun out there.

15:25.058 --> 15:27.525
Just the word I was gonna use.

15:37.437 --> 15:39.015
Well, our
"Weekend Warrior" package

15:39.039 --> 15:40.071
includes zip-lining,

15:40.106 --> 15:42.006
heli-skiing,
and bungee jumping.

15:42.042 --> 15:45.476
The views from 3,000 feet
are spectacular.

15:45.512 --> 15:47.645
Ow!

15:47.681 --> 15:49.380
Uh, may I help you
find something?

15:52.352 --> 15:54.686
Uh, no. No, I, um...

15:54.721 --> 15:56.554
I'm just browsing.

15:56.589 --> 15:58.890
Let me know if you guys
have questions, all right?

16:00.060 --> 16:01.526
Our mountain biking trails

16:01.561 --> 16:03.094
are suitable
for all levels.

16:03.129 --> 16:04.929
Our next excursion
starts in 30 minutes.

16:04.965 --> 16:07.098
Oh, hi!
Hi, hi. Yeah.

16:07.133 --> 16:08.399
The, uh,
the mountain biking

16:08.435 --> 16:10.168
that's suitable
for all levels...

16:10.203 --> 16:11.213
Where do I sign up
for that?

16:11.237 --> 16:13.071
Oh, just fill this out.

16:14.641 --> 16:15.606
Okay.

16:15.642 --> 16:19.043
Do you prefer suspension,
comfort, or fat bike?

16:19.079 --> 16:20.912
Let's just go
with the fat bike.

16:20.947 --> 16:23.414
It has the best grip
in the snow.

16:23.450 --> 16:25.383
Great. Thank you.

16:25.418 --> 16:27.285
I'm Alex, by the way.

16:27.320 --> 16:28.553
Sarah.

16:28.588 --> 16:30.688
See you
on the chairlift.

16:32.058 --> 16:33.725
The chairlift?

16:35.428 --> 16:37.695
Hey!

16:37.731 --> 16:39.364
Is that your jacket?

16:40.500 --> 16:41.799
Don't worry.

16:41.835 --> 16:43.468
You'll warm up
once you get moving.

16:43.503 --> 16:45.903
Oh, I'm not worried...
about that.

16:50.977 --> 16:53.211
There's a seatbelt, right?

16:53.246 --> 16:55.113
Your bike will be
on the next chair.

16:55.148 --> 16:58.349
But is there a seatbelt?
On the lift?

17:00.754 --> 17:02.420
See you up there!

17:02.455 --> 17:04.722
Okay.

17:07.460 --> 17:09.193
Ohh...

17:11.464 --> 17:14.464
Ohh. That's so high up.

17:16.202 --> 17:19.404
I ca... I can't...
I can't do this!

17:19.439 --> 17:20.750
Oh, no, it's too high...
Sorry, I...

17:20.773 --> 17:22.406
I ca... I can't...

17:26.378 --> 17:27.712
Miss! Please
remove yourself.

17:29.883 --> 17:31.983
Would you like
some help, ma'am?

17:33.053 --> 17:34.852
You?

17:34.888 --> 17:37.121
Why not?

17:43.129 --> 17:44.129
Let's get outta here.

17:48.334 --> 17:49.967
Thank you for,
you know,

17:50.003 --> 17:52.070
helping back there,

17:52.105 --> 17:55.139
but I'm pretty sure I can get
myself back to the hotel okay.

17:55.175 --> 17:58.476
And let you cause
another human pile-up?

17:58.511 --> 18:00.411
Not a chance.

18:00.447 --> 18:04.082
Okay, so I'm not
the best biker. Whoops.

18:04.117 --> 18:05.983
More like
a chairlift-mounter.

18:06.019 --> 18:08.086
You haven't gotten
on your bike yet.

18:08.121 --> 18:09.053
Right.

18:09.089 --> 18:11.089
Oh. I can do that.

18:13.793 --> 18:16.294
Okay, it's, uh...

18:16.329 --> 18:18.262
I think
my bike is broken.

18:18.298 --> 18:20.364
No, you just need
to shift the gears down.

18:21.501 --> 18:23.067
This thing?

18:23.103 --> 18:25.236
Right.

18:25.271 --> 18:27.605
Okay.

18:27.640 --> 18:29.607
Whoa-whoa-ah!

18:31.544 --> 18:34.445
I just remembered why I don't
ride bikes in Central Park.

18:34.481 --> 18:35.913
New York, huh?

18:35.949 --> 18:36.848
Yeah.

18:36.883 --> 18:37.949
What're you
doing here?

18:37.984 --> 18:40.318
Oh, that's a long story.

18:40.353 --> 18:41.752
Whatever it is,

18:41.788 --> 18:43.788
you may want to think
about rewriting it.

18:44.958 --> 18:46.157
Right.

18:46.192 --> 18:47.658
Have a good day!

18:47.694 --> 18:51.429
You too.
It sure can't get much worse.

18:51.464 --> 18:52.430
Hey, Cole!

18:52.465 --> 18:53.465
Hey!

18:54.834 --> 18:56.968
Cole Taylor?

19:07.914 --> 19:08.914
Alex!

19:10.083 --> 19:13.151
You're here!

19:13.186 --> 19:14.463
I was about to send out
a search party.

19:14.487 --> 19:16.454
I know, I know,
I'm so sorry.

19:16.489 --> 19:18.890
I guess I wasn't ready
for the chairlift,

19:18.925 --> 19:21.893
or... anything, really.

19:21.928 --> 19:22.894
It's your first time!

19:22.929 --> 19:24.562
You'll get
the hang of it.

19:24.597 --> 19:27.398
You didn't see me out there.

19:27.433 --> 19:29.634
What if you got
yourself a guide?

19:29.669 --> 19:32.303
Maybe. Do...
Do you know anyone?

19:32.338 --> 19:34.305
Well...
most guides I know

19:34.340 --> 19:36.307
are booked up
with Winter Walk this week.

19:36.342 --> 19:38.709
I'm helping the organizer,
but I mean, I could...

19:38.745 --> 19:40.811
No, no, it's okay.

19:40.847 --> 19:43.314
Don't worry about it.
I'll figure something out.

19:43.349 --> 19:45.483
Right now, I just really need
a hot bath.

19:45.518 --> 19:47.518
Thanks, Sarah.
I'll see you later.

19:47.554 --> 19:48.519
Okay. Take care.

19:59.232 --> 20:00.932
My advice?

20:00.967 --> 20:02.833
Stay clear of
the chairlift for a while.

20:02.869 --> 20:04.235
What happened?

20:04.270 --> 20:06.571
Ah, the equivalent
of a human pile-up.

20:06.606 --> 20:08.406
Oh, now I know
you're exaggerating.

20:08.441 --> 20:11.509
Maybe, but that's just because
you didn't meet her.

20:11.544 --> 20:13.110
"Her"?

20:13.146 --> 20:15.513
Yeah. A walking catastrophe.

20:26.960 --> 20:28.626
Hey.

20:28.661 --> 20:30.728
<i>Are you okay?
What happened?</i>

20:30.763 --> 20:33.898
Oh, nothing.
I'm fine. I just, uh...

20:33.933 --> 20:35.266
I went fat biking.

20:35.301 --> 20:36.767
<i>Is that like a new spin class?</i>

20:36.803 --> 20:40.371
No, it's... it's a bike...
on a mountain.

20:40.406 --> 20:43.474
<i>Mountain!
Oh, look at you, babe.</i>

20:43.509 --> 20:46.143
Hmph. Oh.

20:46.179 --> 20:48.379
I totally humiliated myself.

20:48.414 --> 20:49.547
<i>Are you okay?</i>

20:49.582 --> 20:51.115
Yeah. I think.

20:51.150 --> 20:53.217
I don't know.

20:53.253 --> 20:54.785
<i>Well, if you change
your mind,</i>

20:54.821 --> 20:56.053
<i>don't feel bad.</i>

20:56.089 --> 20:58.589
<i>...Been the sporty type.</i>

20:58.625 --> 21:00.091
I'm losing you, Barton.
I...

21:00.126 --> 21:01.292
<i>There's abso...</i>

21:01.327 --> 21:03.060
<i>...shame in coming home...</i>

21:03.096 --> 21:04.295
<i>...boyfriend.</i>

21:04.330 --> 21:07.665
Home? No.
No, I'm gonna be fine.

21:07.700 --> 21:09.567
Everything's gonna be great.

21:09.602 --> 21:11.335
It is just...

21:12.939 --> 21:14.805
Delightful.

21:32.992 --> 21:34.625
Here goes nothing.

21:34.661 --> 21:35.960
"Warrior."

21:49.876 --> 21:52.443
Beautiful, aren't they?

21:52.478 --> 21:54.378
Just gorgeous.

21:54.414 --> 21:57.348
I've actually been following
Cole Taylor's work for a while.

21:57.383 --> 21:59.784
I was hoping maybe I could
speak with him, if he's here?

22:05.224 --> 22:06.691
Hey.

22:06.726 --> 22:08.559
New York?

22:08.594 --> 22:10.027
You two know each other?

22:10.063 --> 22:11.796
Not exactly.

22:11.831 --> 22:15.232
I realize I didn't really give
the best first impression.

22:15.268 --> 22:17.001
That's an understatement.

22:17.036 --> 22:19.470
Right. But I didn't know
it was you, then,

22:19.505 --> 22:21.605
and I'm actually
a really big fan of your work.

22:23.209 --> 22:24.442
I'm Alex Burns.

22:25.778 --> 22:27.244
Cole Taylor.

22:27.280 --> 22:28.546
You're the cause
of the pile-up?

22:28.581 --> 22:29.814
You told him
about that?

22:29.849 --> 22:32.216
Yes.
Safety precaution.

22:32.251 --> 22:34.185
Well, you're right.

22:34.220 --> 22:35.753
I'm pretty much
terrible

22:35.788 --> 22:37.922
at every
outdoor activity,

22:37.957 --> 22:39.924
but I came to Ridgeline
to face my fears,

22:39.959 --> 22:41.992
and it's pretty clear

22:42.028 --> 22:44.195
that I can't really
do it on my own.

22:44.230 --> 22:45.307
I know
that you're not a guide,

22:45.331 --> 22:47.431
but you seem pretty great
at everything that you do,

22:47.467 --> 22:49.734
and there is
no one else available.

22:49.769 --> 22:51.769
Wow. I'm flattered.

22:51.804 --> 22:54.905
No! I'm so sorry. I didn't...
I didn't mean it like that.

22:54.941 --> 22:56.741
I'm a copy editor,

22:56.776 --> 23:00.010
and I just got my first real
travel writing assignment,

23:00.046 --> 23:01.011
which means I can't mess it up.

23:01.047 --> 23:02.613
The problem is

23:02.648 --> 23:04.093
that I'm supposed
to write this article

23:04.117 --> 23:05.850
about me doing
extreme sports,

23:05.885 --> 23:08.285
and I'm basically
afraid of everything,

23:08.321 --> 23:10.588
and probably the worst person
for the job,

23:10.623 --> 23:14.392
but my editor seems to think
that it is a brilliant idea.

23:14.427 --> 23:17.395
It could
be really funny.

23:17.430 --> 23:19.130
Look. This is...

23:19.165 --> 23:21.899
This is
my one shot.

23:21.934 --> 23:24.235
If I don't do this right,
it'll ruin my career.

23:24.270 --> 23:26.070
Please, Cole...

23:26.105 --> 23:27.705
would you please help me?

23:29.409 --> 23:32.610
Sorry, Alex,
we're really busy.

23:32.645 --> 23:35.746
Right. I understand.

23:35.782 --> 23:37.348
We're not that busy.

23:38.584 --> 23:39.550
What?

23:39.585 --> 23:40.785
I have an honest face.

23:40.820 --> 23:42.453
I can't lie.

23:42.488 --> 23:43.988
And you picked the right guy.

23:44.023 --> 23:47.158
I mean,
Cole is great at everything,

23:47.193 --> 23:48.459
and I'm not just saying that

23:48.494 --> 23:50.561
because I run his gallery.

23:50.596 --> 23:52.797
What about the Winter Walk
we're trying to organize?

23:52.832 --> 23:55.232
Uh, "we"? I thought
I was organizing.

23:55.268 --> 23:56.412
What about
the meet-and-greet?

23:56.436 --> 23:57.902
You said you weren't
doing that.

23:57.937 --> 23:59.336
I could help!

23:59.372 --> 24:01.772
With Winter Walk,
or-or the meet-and-greet,

24:01.808 --> 24:02.808
or whatever is needed,

24:02.842 --> 24:04.942
I... and you could help me
with extreme sports.

24:04.977 --> 24:06.410
It's a win-win!

24:06.446 --> 24:08.546
Please?

24:09.816 --> 24:11.749
All right.

24:11.784 --> 24:14.018
But I'm giving you one day
to prove to me

24:14.053 --> 24:15.364
that you're not gonna
kill us both,

24:15.388 --> 24:16.854
and you play by my rules.
Got it?

24:16.889 --> 24:18.456
Got it!

24:18.491 --> 24:21.692
Where are you staying?
Ridgeline Resort?

24:21.727 --> 24:22.693
Mm-hmm.

24:22.728 --> 24:24.829
Meet me at 9:00 a.m.
at the activity center.

24:24.864 --> 24:26.831
9:00 a.m.,
activity center. Got it.

24:26.866 --> 24:28.466
Come prepared to work.

24:28.501 --> 24:30.501
Will do.

24:30.536 --> 24:32.837
Thank you so much!

24:48.771 --> 24:51.839
<i>"Day two

24:51.874 --> 24:53.641

24:54.777 --> 24:56.177

25:15.398 --> 25:16.363
Good morning.

25:16.399 --> 25:17.831
Good morning.

25:17.867 --> 25:19.833
Wow. Perfect timing.

25:19.869 --> 25:21.101
I just checked.

25:21.137 --> 25:23.370
The chopper's leaving
in 20 minutes.

25:24.540 --> 25:25.906
A helicopter?

25:25.942 --> 25:28.776
Yeah. There's a giant
ice cliff nearby.

25:28.811 --> 25:30.511
You've gone ice-climbing
before, right?

25:30.546 --> 25:31.612
Ice-climbing?

25:31.647 --> 25:32.413
While we're up there,

25:32.448 --> 25:33.725
we're gonna paraglide
off the cliff.

25:33.749 --> 25:35.349
Paragliding?

25:35.384 --> 25:36.350
Mm-hmm.

25:36.385 --> 25:41.121
Uh... that all sounds
really fun, but, um...

25:41.157 --> 25:44.091
I just remembered
that I have a, um,

25:44.126 --> 25:45.793
I have a phone call...

25:45.828 --> 25:47.461
Oh, you should see
the look on your face.

25:47.496 --> 25:49.063
- You're joking?
- Yes, I'm joking.

25:49.098 --> 25:50.108
This whole thing
is all a joke?

25:50.132 --> 25:51.765
This is a joke, yes.

25:51.801 --> 25:53.434
It's pretty funny,
right?

25:53.469 --> 25:56.103
You have
a weird sense of humor.

25:56.138 --> 25:57.371
And you have
to lighten up.

25:58.674 --> 25:59.807
Let's go.

25:59.842 --> 26:02.576
I promise,
no chopper.

26:04.947 --> 26:07.114
A climbing gym?

26:07.149 --> 26:09.083
Would you rather
go ice-climbing?

26:09.118 --> 26:10.384
I can call
the chopper.

26:10.419 --> 26:12.286
No, no! It's fine.
It's just that, uh...

26:12.321 --> 26:15.556
This is like a jungle gym
for kids.

26:15.591 --> 26:17.224
I'm not really a kid.

26:17.260 --> 26:19.093
We're all kids at heart.

26:19.128 --> 26:20.494
Plus, we need to shake

26:20.529 --> 26:22.896
some of the city
off of you,

26:22.932 --> 26:24.476
and it'll help you
with your fear of heights.

26:24.500 --> 26:25.566
I'm not afraid of heights.

26:27.803 --> 26:28.969
I mean...

26:29.005 --> 26:30.671
Maybe a little bit.

26:30.706 --> 26:32.906
So, what kind of shoes
did you bring?

26:32.942 --> 26:34.441
Just my running shoes.

26:34.477 --> 26:36.010
- Those are your running shoes?
- Yeah!

26:36.045 --> 26:37.745
Do they even
offer you support?

26:37.780 --> 26:40.147
No, but they look really cute
with my outfit.

26:40.182 --> 26:42.082
No.

26:42.118 --> 26:45.252
See, the problem is,
you don't have the right gear.

26:45.288 --> 26:47.621
No offense,
but this isn't really my style,

26:47.657 --> 26:50.858
it's, uh... very orange.

26:50.893 --> 26:52.259
Oh. Right.

26:52.295 --> 26:55.796
Excuse me?
We need some help here.

26:55.831 --> 26:57.665
Yeah, we need
to fix this.

26:57.700 --> 26:58.666
All the basics.

26:58.701 --> 26:59.767
Top to bottom.

26:59.802 --> 27:01.335
Please.

27:01.370 --> 27:02.336
And shoes, please.

27:02.371 --> 27:04.505
Sure thing.

27:05.975 --> 27:07.474
So...

27:07.510 --> 27:09.376
Who's the guy?

27:09.412 --> 27:11.845
Guy...? What guy?
What're you talking about?

27:11.881 --> 27:14.848
Come on. There's gotta be
a reason why you're doing this...

27:14.884 --> 27:16.850
Humiliating yourself.
I mean...

27:16.886 --> 27:18.652
besides the work thing.

27:18.688 --> 27:19.653
No offense,

27:19.689 --> 27:21.388
but you're not
the sporty type.

27:21.424 --> 27:23.691
I will have you know,

27:23.726 --> 27:27.127
that I was "Sporty Spice"
one year for Halloween.

27:29.031 --> 27:30.864
Okay, actually,
I was "Posh Spice".

27:32.034 --> 27:33.500
My boyfriend,
Barton,

27:33.536 --> 27:36.337
is very sweet
and very supportive of me.

27:36.372 --> 27:38.672
Your boyfriend's
name is Barton?

27:38.708 --> 27:40.541
What is he, a lord?

27:40.576 --> 27:41.842
No.

27:41.877 --> 27:43.243
He's an investment banker

27:43.279 --> 27:45.412
at a very prestigious
firm in New York City.

27:45.448 --> 27:47.247
Mm. Why isn't he here?

27:47.283 --> 27:50.084
Because he just got
promoted to partner,

27:50.119 --> 27:53.821
so he is very important
and very busy.

27:53.856 --> 27:56.523
Sounds like you're making
a whole lot of excuses for him.

27:56.559 --> 27:58.058
I am not!

27:58.094 --> 28:00.594
Okay. What about you?

28:00.629 --> 28:01.995
With your
sunny disposition,

28:02.031 --> 28:04.064
I bet you have girls
falling all over you.

28:04.100 --> 28:06.567
No. I'm single by choice.

28:06.602 --> 28:09.837
With the work I do,
I don't really need anyone else.

28:09.872 --> 28:11.839
Right. You don't need
anyone slowing you down.

28:11.874 --> 28:13.374
Exactly.

28:14.577 --> 28:16.043
How's this?

28:16.078 --> 28:19.179
Do I look like one of
your happy photographs yet?

28:19.215 --> 28:20.247
Nearly.

28:21.951 --> 28:23.450
You ready
to face your fears?

28:23.486 --> 28:26.019
At least I look like I am.

28:27.490 --> 28:28.922
Are these the shoes?

28:28.958 --> 28:30.124
These are the shoes.

28:30.159 --> 28:31.859
Are there any other colors?

28:31.894 --> 28:33.427
No.

28:36.499 --> 28:38.565
Okay, now, you want
to be aware of everything

28:38.601 --> 28:40.033
that's underneath you
at all times.

28:40.069 --> 28:43.904
'Kay? Keep your weight
on your feet,

28:43.939 --> 28:45.305
your arms straight.

28:45.341 --> 28:47.241
Kind of like this...
My arms are straight...

28:47.276 --> 28:49.777
and I go up,
push up...

28:49.812 --> 28:50.878
You're a pro at this.

28:50.913 --> 28:52.312
Are you sure
you're not a guide?

28:53.516 --> 28:55.394
That kind of charm is not
gonna get you off the hook.

28:55.418 --> 28:56.950
Figured I'd try.

28:58.287 --> 29:00.554
Oh! I'm stuck.

29:00.589 --> 29:01.900
No, you're fine.
Focus on your feet.

29:01.924 --> 29:02.890
Don't look down.

29:02.925 --> 29:05.225
My feet are down!
Where am I supposed to look?

29:05.261 --> 29:06.727
Focus on your footholds.

29:09.265 --> 29:10.431
Exactly.

29:10.466 --> 29:11.932
Anticipate the next two moves.

29:11.967 --> 29:13.467
I anticipate
I'm gonna fall.

29:13.502 --> 29:14.835
You're not
gonna fall.

29:14.870 --> 29:17.638
There's about 50% chance
that I will.

29:17.673 --> 29:19.173
You're just psyching
yourself out.

29:19.208 --> 29:22.743
You wanna keep your grip relaxed
and <i> breathe.</i>

29:23.546 --> 29:25.913
Good!

29:25.948 --> 29:27.448
That's right.

29:27.483 --> 29:29.616
So how long have
you been taking photos?

29:29.652 --> 29:31.118
Ah, since
I was young.

29:31.153 --> 29:33.120
You're really good at it.

29:33.155 --> 29:35.189
Thanks.

29:35.224 --> 29:38.525
You know,
life never really stops moving.

29:38.561 --> 29:40.294
Every time I go into nature,

29:40.329 --> 29:43.130
it seems like
everything is different.

29:43.165 --> 29:46.133
Waves are always rolling,
leaves are always growing...

29:46.168 --> 29:48.869
nothing stays the same.

29:48.904 --> 29:52.139
I guess that's my way
of holding onto a moment

29:52.174 --> 29:54.208
and capturing it.

29:54.243 --> 29:55.809
That's really beautiful.

29:55.845 --> 29:58.846
I never thought about nature
that way.

29:58.881 --> 30:00.013
Well, stick with me, kid.

30:00.049 --> 30:01.348
You may just learn
a few things.

30:01.383 --> 30:02.716
Is that a promise?

30:05.521 --> 30:06.653
Oh, hey!

30:06.689 --> 30:07.855
Yeah.

30:07.890 --> 30:10.057
We're at the top!

30:10.092 --> 30:11.169
Did you distract me
on purpose?

30:11.193 --> 30:12.193
Did it work?

30:15.064 --> 30:17.064
How do we get down?

30:17.099 --> 30:18.899
Oh, you just have to let go.

30:18.934 --> 30:21.168
No! I-I can't let go.
I'm gonna fall!

30:21.203 --> 30:23.237
Falling is a part of climbing.

30:23.272 --> 30:25.072
Every climber falls.

30:25.107 --> 30:26.807
Does that make sense?

30:26.842 --> 30:28.141
You're okay.

30:28.177 --> 30:29.743
That's still yet
to be determined.

30:29.778 --> 30:31.845
One, two, three...
Jump.

30:35.184 --> 30:37.184
You're going faster!

30:42.358 --> 30:44.057
That was fun!

30:44.093 --> 30:46.026
Yeah!
It was really fun.

30:46.061 --> 30:48.262
Thanks, Coach.

30:48.297 --> 30:51.865
Now you can tell Lord Barton
you passed the test.

30:51.901 --> 30:54.101
Tomorrow, we're gonna
start your real training.

30:54.136 --> 30:55.435
Yeah?

30:55.471 --> 30:57.738
But, first...
you help me.

31:05.881 --> 31:08.115
"Taylor Youth"?
Is that you?

31:08.150 --> 31:10.684
It's a charity
I started a few years ago,

31:10.719 --> 31:13.420
to raise money
for underprivileged kids.

31:13.455 --> 31:15.556
Trips and gear can
be pretty expensive.

31:15.591 --> 31:17.925
This gives them a chance

31:17.960 --> 31:19.293
to come to Ridgeline

31:19.328 --> 31:21.428
and practice
winter sports for free.

31:21.463 --> 31:23.931
That's really nice.

31:23.966 --> 31:24.932
I got the impression,
though,

31:24.967 --> 31:26.934
that you didn't want
to do a meet-and-greet?

31:26.969 --> 31:28.735
I don't really...

31:28.771 --> 31:30.237
...But 50%
of the profits

31:30.272 --> 31:31.305
made during Winter Walk

31:31.340 --> 31:33.307
goes to The Taylor
Youth Foundation.

31:33.342 --> 31:35.442
Right now,
we're able to send

31:35.477 --> 31:38.812
about ten kids each year
to winter camps.

31:38.847 --> 31:40.914
I'd like that number
to go higher, so...

31:42.351 --> 31:45.052
If doing a meet-and-greet
can help, then...

31:45.087 --> 31:46.264
Well, then
we better get stapling.

31:46.288 --> 31:47.288
And then
let's have lunch.

31:48.624 --> 31:51.458
I will have the turkey burger

31:51.493 --> 31:53.794
with no bun,

31:53.829 --> 31:55.462
no cheese, no bacon,

31:55.497 --> 31:57.497
no mushrooms or onions...

31:57.533 --> 32:00.233
just plai...
Is it organic?

32:00.269 --> 32:02.102
It doesn't matter.

32:02.137 --> 32:04.905
I'll have a cheeseburger,
all dressed. Please.

32:04.940 --> 32:07.074
Thank you.

32:08.544 --> 32:11.511
So... you're a copy editor?

32:11.547 --> 32:13.580
Yep.

32:13.616 --> 32:14.748
For seven years.

32:14.783 --> 32:15.783
It's a good job.

32:15.818 --> 32:17.818
It pays well
and it's stable.

32:17.853 --> 32:19.119
But?

32:19.154 --> 32:20.020
Don't get me wrong,

32:20.055 --> 32:22.155
I'm very grateful
to have my job, but...

32:23.392 --> 32:24.769
It just makes things
a little difficult

32:24.793 --> 32:27.260
when my boss
only sees me one way.

32:27.296 --> 32:29.830
So you feel like
you have to prove yourself?

32:29.865 --> 32:31.932
Let's just say

32:31.967 --> 32:33.867
that no one expects me
to be up here,

32:33.902 --> 32:35.802
doing extreme sports.

32:35.838 --> 32:37.537
Okay.

32:37.573 --> 32:39.172
And what do you think?

32:39.208 --> 32:41.375
They're probably right.

32:43.512 --> 32:45.212
Well, tomorrow,
we're going to be hiking

32:45.247 --> 32:48.815
the woods of Ridgeline.

32:48.851 --> 32:50.495
We'll prove that you're
supposed to be here.

32:50.519 --> 32:51.652
Do you really think that?

32:51.687 --> 32:52.919
No.

32:54.089 --> 32:55.166
But I guess we'll find out.

33:12.408 --> 33:13.674
Hello?

33:13.709 --> 33:15.442
This is your morning
wake-up call.

33:15.477 --> 33:16.610
<i>Cole?</i>

33:16.645 --> 33:17.878
What time is it?

33:17.913 --> 33:20.447
<i>Time to face your fears.</i>

33:20.482 --> 33:23.050
I'm pretty sure
I just fell asleep.

33:23.085 --> 33:25.819
And I'm pretty sure the wild
waits for no woman.

33:25.854 --> 33:27.220
<i>I'll meet you downstairs.</i>

33:27.256 --> 33:29.790
Okay, okay, okay.
I'm getting up, I'm getting up.

33:30.993 --> 33:32.659
Morning, sunshine.

33:32.695 --> 33:34.494
Took you long enough.

33:34.530 --> 33:36.697
Did I mention that
it's, like, five miles

33:36.732 --> 33:39.132
to my middle-of-
nowhere cabin?

33:39.168 --> 33:40.467
Okay, grumpy.

33:40.502 --> 33:42.169
Let's get you
some coffee.

33:42.204 --> 33:44.071
And some breakfast,
please.

33:44.106 --> 33:45.483
Well, funny you
should mention that.

33:45.507 --> 33:47.240
That's exactly
where we're going.

33:47.276 --> 33:48.809
Great.

33:52.681 --> 33:55.148
I thought you said we were
going for breakfast?

33:55.184 --> 33:57.050
Patience, my friend.

33:57.086 --> 33:59.219
Patience has rarely
been my friend.

33:59.254 --> 34:01.421
See? That's your
problem right there.

34:01.457 --> 34:03.090
You live with
a city mentality

34:03.125 --> 34:05.992
where everything needs
to happen instantly.

34:06.028 --> 34:08.929
You need to stop
and smell the pine trees.

34:08.964 --> 34:10.864
Everything that matters
is right here,

34:10.899 --> 34:12.065
in this moment.

34:12.101 --> 34:14.601
You just
have to breathe.

34:14.636 --> 34:16.703
I don't think that's
a city mentality,

34:16.739 --> 34:18.572
I think that's
just our world.

34:18.607 --> 34:20.674
Social media has
changed everything.

34:20.708 --> 34:23.409
Ahh... ho, ho.
Social media.

34:23.445 --> 34:25.612
Where everyone
can see your status,

34:25.647 --> 34:28.014
and it's none
of their business.

34:28.050 --> 34:30.050
I try to stay as far
away from that stuff

34:30.085 --> 34:31.551
as possible.

34:31.587 --> 34:34.221
You know, I actually
think you could have

34:34.255 --> 34:35.422
quite the lucrative career,

34:35.456 --> 34:37.190
if you had more of
an online presence.

34:39.795 --> 34:41.962
I mean, not that
you're not successful,

34:41.996 --> 34:44.063
and not that I know

34:44.099 --> 34:46.433
if you have a social media page
or not, or anything.

34:46.467 --> 34:48.268
Were you Googling me?

34:48.303 --> 34:50.637
No. I-I... No. I...

34:50.672 --> 34:53.806
Maybe just...
Maybe a little bit.

34:53.842 --> 34:56.076
Right.

34:56.110 --> 34:59.579
I do have a website
but it's for my work,

34:59.615 --> 35:01.815
not my personal life.

35:01.850 --> 35:05.986
My photos
speak for themselves.

35:06.021 --> 35:09.122
I take pictures
because I have to.

35:09.158 --> 35:11.057
That's how I feel
about writing.

35:11.093 --> 35:12.626
When I don't write,
I feel empty.

35:13.829 --> 35:15.095
You know, when I was little,

35:15.130 --> 35:17.063
I used to write
all these short stories

35:17.099 --> 35:20.400
about all the amazing
places I was gonna visit.

35:20.435 --> 35:21.501
Oh, yeah?

35:21.537 --> 35:23.170
- Yeah.
- Where to?

35:23.205 --> 35:25.972
Uh... all over.
It doesn't really matter.

35:26.008 --> 35:27.607
I've never been to any of them.

35:27.643 --> 35:31.912
I guess life and fear
just kinda got in the way.

35:33.382 --> 35:36.249
Well, look at you now.
Facing those fears.

35:36.285 --> 35:38.251
Pretty soon,
you'll be unstoppable.

35:39.955 --> 35:41.721
Well, I don't know
about that.

35:43.725 --> 35:45.258
Do you have to walk so fast?

35:52.367 --> 35:55.101
Oh, wow!

35:55.137 --> 35:57.604
Look! Such
a beautiful waterfall!

36:00.042 --> 36:01.374
Keep moving.

36:01.410 --> 36:02.776
We're going
all the way up there.

36:04.546 --> 36:06.079
You don't want
to stop and look?

36:08.016 --> 36:09.516
No?

36:09.551 --> 36:10.483
Let's keep going.

36:10.519 --> 36:11.484
It's gonna get icy.

36:11.520 --> 36:12.520
Okay.

36:16.325 --> 36:18.491
There has to be
another way across.

36:18.527 --> 36:21.962
No, this is the only way
to get to where we're going.

36:21.997 --> 36:23.897
Do you know
how many people fall

36:23.932 --> 36:26.299
from extreme heights
every single year?

36:26.335 --> 36:28.468
I do! I looked it up.

36:28.503 --> 36:29.870
I'm sure you did.

36:29.905 --> 36:31.571
But you can do it.

36:31.607 --> 36:34.474
I'll be with you
every step of the way.

36:34.509 --> 36:35.942
Come on.

36:37.079 --> 36:38.645
Come on. Yeah!
That's right!

36:39.882 --> 36:40.981
Oh...

36:43.518 --> 36:44.918
See? You're doing great!

36:44.953 --> 36:46.853
I bet you say that
to everyone.

36:48.223 --> 36:49.656
You're right.

36:49.691 --> 36:51.825
That's kinda my shtick,
actually.

36:51.860 --> 36:53.271
You seem like a guy
who would have a shtick.

36:53.295 --> 36:54.494
I do?

36:54.529 --> 36:56.062
No. Not at all.

36:56.098 --> 36:57.664
I'm just talking
to distract myself

36:57.699 --> 36:58.699
from the terror I feel

36:58.734 --> 36:59.844
and the sudden desire I have

36:59.868 --> 37:01.668
to knock myself out
with my shoe.

37:01.703 --> 37:03.536
You're learning fast.

37:03.572 --> 37:05.705
Oh! You okay?

37:07.075 --> 37:09.075
Can we please turn around now?

37:09.111 --> 37:10.410
You're almost there.

37:10.445 --> 37:13.680
You got just
a few more steps to do.

37:15.884 --> 37:17.183
You got this!

37:17.219 --> 37:19.686
Yeah!

37:21.957 --> 37:23.690
Attagirl.

37:23.725 --> 37:25.625
I made it?

37:25.661 --> 37:27.560
Like I had a doubt.

37:27.596 --> 37:29.429
So now
you believe in me?

37:29.464 --> 37:31.531
One of us has to.

37:33.001 --> 37:35.101
Okay. Now,
don't freak out,

37:35.137 --> 37:36.770
but it's time to go
even higher.

37:36.805 --> 37:38.038
Way up there.

37:39.074 --> 37:40.907
Come on.

37:42.144 --> 37:44.044
Wow.

37:44.079 --> 37:45.946
This is beautiful!

37:45.981 --> 37:48.448
Yeah, it's one of
my favorite lookouts.

37:48.483 --> 37:51.117
This is so nice!

37:52.454 --> 37:55.588
So, if you could go anywhere,
where would it be?

37:55.624 --> 37:59.125
Zimbabwe. So I can stand
at the foot of Victoria Falls

37:59.161 --> 38:00.727
and watch the elephants
first-hand.

38:00.762 --> 38:02.696
They're such beautiful animals.

38:04.166 --> 38:06.399
What about you?

38:06.435 --> 38:08.413
I bet you've been everywhere
and done everything, right?

38:08.437 --> 38:10.470
Yeah, I've traveled
a fair bit.

38:11.707 --> 38:13.440
Not everywhere, though.

38:13.475 --> 38:15.942
What's your number-one
bucket-list item, then?

38:15.978 --> 38:17.510
Ready?

38:17.546 --> 38:18.611
Yeah?

38:19.648 --> 38:23.950
I would go bungee jumping
off Victoria Falls.

38:23.986 --> 38:25.285
- No way!
- Mm-hmm.

38:25.320 --> 38:26.586
Really?

38:26.621 --> 38:28.655
Yeah. Really.

38:28.690 --> 38:31.291
That is just eerily weird.

38:31.326 --> 38:32.692
And crazy!

38:32.728 --> 38:35.261
I mean, diving head-first
off of a cliff?

38:35.297 --> 38:36.663
Why would you want to do that?

38:36.698 --> 38:38.832
It's so much prettier
from the ground.

38:38.867 --> 38:42.635
I don't know.
There's something about Africa.

38:42.671 --> 38:44.337
I'd like to capture it.

38:45.707 --> 38:48.341
I haven't taken
any new photos...

38:48.377 --> 38:51.177
any good photos, I should say,
in the past two years.

38:51.213 --> 38:52.812
What's stopping you?

38:52.848 --> 38:54.347
I think I need to go somewhere,

38:54.383 --> 38:56.349
get re-inspired,
you know?

38:56.385 --> 38:58.218
You should.

38:58.253 --> 38:59.786
I can speak from experience,

38:59.821 --> 39:02.722
that, so far,
this isn't so bad.

39:02.758 --> 39:05.658
Good! Then
our adventure continues.

39:08.263 --> 39:09.674
When you zip through the trees,

39:09.698 --> 39:12.365
you'll reach the highest drop
of 2,200 feet.

39:12.401 --> 39:13.867
Trust me,
you've never felt so free.

39:13.902 --> 39:15.402
It's awesome!

39:15.437 --> 39:17.737
2,200 feet?

39:17.773 --> 39:18.738
Ah, give or take,

39:18.774 --> 39:20.640
but let me reassure you,
you're in good hands.

39:20.675 --> 39:22.509
And the, uh...

39:22.544 --> 39:23.343
the equipment?

39:23.378 --> 39:25.712
Oh, top-of-the-line.
Only the best.

39:25.747 --> 39:28.048
Just asking,
'cause, uh,

39:28.083 --> 39:30.016
most accidents
happen by routine.

39:30.052 --> 39:33.019
You know, doing the same thing
over and over again,

39:33.055 --> 39:34.254
expecting different results.

39:34.289 --> 39:36.489
Isn't that
the definition of insanity?

39:36.525 --> 39:39.025
Well, the two go
hand in hand, right?

39:39.061 --> 39:41.094
I mean, we're about
to jump off a cliff.

39:41.129 --> 39:42.829
You're clipped in.

39:42.864 --> 39:44.898
And I double-checked
you twice.

39:44.933 --> 39:46.044
All right, you're good to go.

39:46.068 --> 39:47.767
Sweet!

39:47.803 --> 39:49.402
Cole. Cole, please.

39:49.438 --> 39:50.570
We don't
have to do this.

39:50.605 --> 39:51.704
Can we just
walk back down,

39:51.740 --> 39:52.572
the way we came?

39:52.607 --> 39:55.909
Alex, if you really want
to write about

39:55.944 --> 39:57.510
conquering your fears,

39:57.546 --> 39:59.946
you're gonna
have to take the leap,

39:59.981 --> 40:02.382
or else your readers
will see right through you.

40:04.653 --> 40:06.030
See, I wouldn't
take the shots that I take

40:06.054 --> 40:07.987
if I wasn't out there
doing it, right?

40:10.258 --> 40:11.224
You're not in any danger.

40:11.259 --> 40:14.360
Trust me, hundreds of people
are doing this.

40:14.396 --> 40:16.029
Right.

40:16.064 --> 40:17.864
I'll go first.

40:17.899 --> 40:20.366
I'll wait for you
on the other side, okay?

40:20.402 --> 40:21.968
Okay.

40:22.003 --> 40:23.770
Okay.

40:23.805 --> 40:25.305
All right!

40:25.340 --> 40:27.640
This is fun.

40:27.676 --> 40:28.908
Here we go.

40:35.750 --> 40:38.017
This is beautiful!

40:46.428 --> 40:48.661
Come on, Alex!
You can do it!

40:48.697 --> 40:49.963
He's right.

40:49.998 --> 40:51.431
I mean, your fear
isn't real.

40:51.466 --> 40:53.366
Come on, Alex!

40:54.469 --> 40:57.070
Okay.

41:00.375 --> 41:03.643
I'm pretty sure
I'm not imagining thi-i-i-is!

41:08.884 --> 41:11.918
♪ Whoa, oh, oh, oh-oh ♪

41:13.188 --> 41:17.123
♪ Whoa, oh, oh, oh-oh ♪

41:17.159 --> 41:19.926
♪ This moment in time ♪

41:21.830 --> 41:24.130
♪ Whoa, oh, oh ♪

41:24.166 --> 41:26.432
♪ Waiting... ♪

41:26.468 --> 41:30.270
♪ Never did a thing for me ♪

41:30.305 --> 41:31.871
Good?

41:31.907 --> 41:33.540
Yeah!

41:33.575 --> 41:35.041
I did it!

41:35.076 --> 41:36.809
You sure did!
You did it.

41:36.845 --> 41:38.311
Oh! That was
incredible.

41:39.981 --> 41:42.215
There you go!
How're you feeling?

41:42.250 --> 41:43.950
I feel good!

41:43.985 --> 41:45.451
That was scary,
but it was amazing.

41:45.487 --> 41:46.519
Good!

41:46.555 --> 41:47.820
Wait. Don't move.

41:47.856 --> 41:48.888
What are you doing?

41:48.924 --> 41:50.001
I'm just
capturing the moment.

41:53.995 --> 41:55.328
Stay there.

42:03.104 --> 42:06.239
Oh, it's Barton.
Give me one second.

42:06.274 --> 42:07.807
Hey! Barton!

42:07.842 --> 42:10.343
You'll never believe
what I just did.

42:10.378 --> 42:13.379
Can you hear me?

42:13.415 --> 42:16.216
Barton? Yeah! Hey.

42:16.251 --> 42:19.085
I just ziplined!

42:19.120 --> 42:21.721
It was incredible!

42:25.360 --> 42:27.694
<i>"So it turns out...</i>

42:27.729 --> 42:30.296
<i>"I might've been
imagining my fear.</i>

42:30.332 --> 42:32.665
<i>"I'm still fact-checking this,
so stand by,</i>

42:32.701 --> 42:33.933
<i>"but what if</i>

42:33.969 --> 42:36.836
<i>"we've turned our backs
on ourselves for so long,</i>

42:36.871 --> 42:38.404

42:43.044 --> 42:44.978
<i>"because it's familiar?</i>

42:45.013 --> 42:47.146
<i>"When do we stop

42:47.182 --> 42:48.302

42:52.621 --> 42:54.988
<i>This is Barton Kane.
Wait for it.</i>

42:55.023 --> 42:56.023
Barton, it's me.

42:56.057 --> 42:58.258
Uh, I keep missing you.

42:58.293 --> 43:00.593
I guess
we're missing each other.

43:00.629 --> 43:02.729
Give me a call back.

43:04.566 --> 43:06.199
Sarah?

43:06.234 --> 43:07.533
Alex! Hey.

43:07.569 --> 43:10.236
Hi. You were gonna carry
this all by yourself?

43:10.272 --> 43:11.838
Ah, it's
no big deal.

43:11.873 --> 43:14.507
I can see that.
Where are you going?

43:14.542 --> 43:15.775
Town Square.

43:15.810 --> 43:18.011
I'll help you.
Come on. You got that?

43:18.046 --> 43:19.445
Thanks.

43:19.481 --> 43:21.881
Let's just
put this right here.

43:21.916 --> 43:23.349
Okay.

43:25.120 --> 43:27.120
Ahh! There you are.

43:27.155 --> 43:28.254
Hey, Cole.

43:28.290 --> 43:29.389
Hey, Sarah.

43:29.424 --> 43:30.690
Wait. You two
know each other?

43:30.725 --> 43:33.760
Oh, we go way back.
Pre-chairlift.

43:33.795 --> 43:35.728
How do you know Cole?

43:35.764 --> 43:37.196
Oh, we go way, way back.

43:37.232 --> 43:38.364
Pre-pre-chairlift.

43:39.567 --> 43:41.367
Cole's my Coach.

43:41.403 --> 43:42.802
Right.

43:42.837 --> 43:44.704
Nice.

43:44.739 --> 43:46.739
You need my help
with anything?

43:46.775 --> 43:49.475
No. No, pretty much everything
is set up for Winter Walk.

43:49.511 --> 43:50.576
I was actually thinking

43:50.612 --> 43:52.478
we should go skiing.

43:52.514 --> 43:53.813
Skiing?

43:53.848 --> 43:54.881
Uh-huh.

43:54.916 --> 43:55.916
I, uh, I think

43:55.950 --> 43:58.318
I should probably just stay here
and help Sarah.

43:58.353 --> 43:59.385
She's got a lot to do.

43:59.421 --> 44:01.621
Oh, no, I'm good.
You two go.

44:01.656 --> 44:02.889
Wait a minute.

44:02.924 --> 44:04.390
You don't ski either?

44:04.426 --> 44:07.226
Not since I was 12
and grew, like, eight inches.

44:07.262 --> 44:10.129
I was all long limbs,
flailing down the mountain.

44:12.200 --> 44:14.600
Well, that's a sight
I'd like to see.

44:14.636 --> 44:15.902
It wasn't pretty.

44:15.937 --> 44:17.236
They nicknamed me "Snowplow."

44:17.272 --> 44:19.272
Ouch.

44:19.307 --> 44:21.441
Maybe we can change that.

44:21.476 --> 44:23.276
It's okay if we don't.

44:23.311 --> 44:26.112
Sometimes, you just
have to move forward, you know?

44:26.147 --> 44:27.647
Let the past go.

44:27.682 --> 44:29.182
Or we can face it.

44:29.217 --> 44:31.551
You know... you, me,
and the bunny hill.

44:33.388 --> 44:35.254
Come on, Snowplow.
Let's go.

44:35.290 --> 44:36.789
Bye, Sarah.

44:36.825 --> 44:37.835
Bundle up, Alex.
It's snowing up there.

44:37.859 --> 44:39.792
Have fun!

44:50.805 --> 44:52.605
Are you sure
this is the bunny hill?

44:52.640 --> 44:54.507
It looks a lot
like a black diamond.

44:54.542 --> 44:57.777
Keep your weight
centered over your knees,

44:57.812 --> 44:59.312
equally distributed.

44:59.347 --> 45:00.646
'Kay...

45:00.682 --> 45:02.548
Keep your hands
forward.

45:02.584 --> 45:05.485
And, after that,
it's a bit of a dance.

45:05.520 --> 45:07.487
It's swish...

45:07.522 --> 45:09.188
swish...

45:09.224 --> 45:10.456
...Swish.

45:10.492 --> 45:11.891
- Okay?
- "Swish."

45:11.926 --> 45:13.826
Panic will
make you lose your rhythm.

45:13.862 --> 45:14.627
That's when you wipe out.

45:14.662 --> 45:15.962
Right.

45:15.997 --> 45:18.965
Just remember...
Swish... swish...

45:19.000 --> 45:20.466
- "Swish."
- Swish.

45:20.502 --> 45:22.468
- Okay?
- Right.

45:22.504 --> 45:24.370
Okay. Don't panic.

45:24.406 --> 45:25.838
Swish... swish...

45:29.511 --> 45:30.977
Swish...

45:31.012 --> 45:33.546
Swish...

45:33.581 --> 45:34.914
And breathe!

45:34.949 --> 45:36.215
Calm glides.

45:47.228 --> 45:48.661
You okay?
You hurt?

45:48.696 --> 45:50.329
I'm okay.

45:50.365 --> 45:51.431
Are you sure?

45:51.466 --> 45:53.032
No.

45:53.067 --> 45:56.669
'Kay, maybe we should
put some ice on it.

45:56.704 --> 45:58.682
Isn't that what caused
the problem in the first place?

46:01.042 --> 46:03.276
I think I know what
will warm us up.

46:03.311 --> 46:04.343
What?

46:04.379 --> 46:05.711
S'mores!

46:05.747 --> 46:07.480
Mm! Let's go.

46:14.289 --> 46:16.355
So, what do you think so far?

46:16.391 --> 46:17.957
Other than a bad hip.

46:17.992 --> 46:19.025
Other than the bad hip,

46:19.060 --> 46:20.359
and the freezing
temperatures...

46:20.395 --> 46:21.461
And the sub-par company.

46:21.496 --> 46:23.296
That too, yeah.

46:23.331 --> 46:25.565
You can be very
demanding sometimes.

46:25.600 --> 46:26.699
"Demanding"?

46:26.734 --> 46:27.800
But...

46:27.836 --> 46:29.569
There's a but?

46:29.604 --> 46:31.604
I am starting
to realize

46:31.639 --> 46:33.473
why my boss
chose this story.

46:33.508 --> 46:36.275
He'd mentioned
something about

46:36.311 --> 46:37.354
an inner-
and an outer-journey,

46:37.378 --> 46:41.080
and I think I'm finally
understanding what he meant.

46:41.115 --> 46:43.049
Yeah, this place can have
that affect on people.

46:44.285 --> 46:47.386
Or it could just be
the sub-par company.

46:48.957 --> 46:51.290
She learns fast.

46:52.527 --> 46:54.560
Okay, you find
the Graham crackers,

46:54.596 --> 46:56.462
and I'll track down
the marshmallows, okay?

46:56.498 --> 46:57.930
Wouldn't they be
in the same aisle?

46:57.966 --> 46:59.398
You're probably right.

47:00.502 --> 47:02.401
Oh, hold on one sec.

47:02.437 --> 47:04.437
That's my boss.
Just give me a sec.

47:04.472 --> 47:05.938
You take it.
I'll be right back.

47:05.974 --> 47:07.473
Mr. McHugh?

47:07.509 --> 47:08.941
Alex, how's it going?

47:08.977 --> 47:09.942
Great, actually.

47:09.978 --> 47:11.911
Cole Taylor was just
teaching me how to ski.

47:11.946 --> 47:13.579
You found Cole Taylor?

47:13.615 --> 47:15.815
So you're writing
the article about him?

47:15.850 --> 47:17.283
What? No, I-I thought

47:17.318 --> 47:18.529
that you said
that you wanted me to write...

47:18.553 --> 47:19.519
<i>If you have
access to Cole,</i>

47:19.554 --> 47:20.987
use it.

47:21.022 --> 47:22.955
Incorporate him
into your story.

47:22.991 --> 47:25.124
But sir, you said
that I was a travel writer,

47:25.159 --> 47:26.659
not an investigative journalist.

47:26.694 --> 47:28.761
<i>That was before
you found him.</i>

47:28.796 --> 47:30.663
That's also before I knew him.

47:30.698 --> 47:32.498
I don't think
he's gonna go for it.

47:32.534 --> 47:34.100
The more Cole Taylor,
the better.

47:34.135 --> 47:35.635
Trust me on this.

47:35.670 --> 47:37.648
<i>This could be a real contender
for the cover story.</i>

47:37.672 --> 47:38.682
Sir, please,
I really don't think that...

47:43.144 --> 47:44.310
Everything okay?

47:44.345 --> 47:46.312
Yeah, yeah...

47:46.347 --> 47:48.214
- Great.
- Everything's fine.

47:48.249 --> 47:50.530
Excellent, because there's
a firepit with our names on it.

47:58.893 --> 48:00.993
S'mores always
remind me of home.

48:01.029 --> 48:03.696
Oh, yeah.
Where's home?

48:03.731 --> 48:06.365
Jackson Hole,
Wyoming.

48:06.401 --> 48:09.502
Ah, a mountain man
through and through.

48:09.537 --> 48:12.405
Why leave paradise when
it's right in your backyard?

48:12.440 --> 48:15.241
That's something
that Barton would say.

48:15.276 --> 48:18.678
It gotta be hard,
being here without Barton.

48:18.713 --> 48:21.714
Yeah. It is.

48:21.749 --> 48:25.151
Um, this really isn't
his kind of thing though.

48:25.186 --> 48:27.219
What?

48:27.255 --> 48:28.654
Who doesn't like s'mores?

48:30.792 --> 48:32.758
I know, I mean,
I just meant

48:32.794 --> 48:34.271
that we don't really
do things like this

48:34.295 --> 48:35.595
together.

48:35.630 --> 48:37.730
We usually do things
that are a little more safe.

48:37.765 --> 48:38.909
The change of scenery
really does

48:38.933 --> 48:40.733
put things
into perspective.

48:40.768 --> 48:43.336
But the silence
helps, too.

48:43.371 --> 48:46.038
Hell, no! The silence
is the reason I can't sleep.

48:46.074 --> 48:47.940
Well, the answer is easy.
You gotta breathe.

48:47.976 --> 48:50.409
So that's your big advice
for why I can't sleep?

48:50.445 --> 48:51.777
Just try it.

48:51.813 --> 48:55.348
If nothing else,
it'll keep you alive.

49:00.922 --> 49:02.154
You're right.

49:03.324 --> 49:04.457
I feel more Zen
already.

49:04.492 --> 49:05.725
Look at you!

49:05.760 --> 49:07.893
I hardly recognize you.

49:17.672 --> 49:19.605
How come you're not
afraid of anything?

49:19.641 --> 49:20.740
What do you mean?

49:20.775 --> 49:22.208
You're good at everything.

49:22.243 --> 49:24.276
And you could just
jump off a cliff

49:24.312 --> 49:25.945
and fall
from the sky

49:25.980 --> 49:27.146
with your eyes
wide open,

49:27.181 --> 49:28.481
not a care
in the world.

49:28.516 --> 49:30.583
Change your perspective.

49:30.618 --> 49:31.984
I mean...

49:32.020 --> 49:33.619
Everyone has fears,

49:33.655 --> 49:35.054
it's just
that mine are different.

49:35.089 --> 49:37.089
Different how?

49:37.125 --> 49:38.791
Just different.

49:42.263 --> 49:46.165
I'm not good with crowds
or attention on me.

49:46.200 --> 49:47.900
That's why I like
to keep to myself.

49:47.935 --> 49:50.036
And why you don't want
to do the meet-and-greet?

49:51.706 --> 49:53.673
But your work is so good!

49:53.708 --> 49:55.408
You should be so proud of it.

49:55.443 --> 49:56.475
I am.

49:56.511 --> 49:59.178
I really am.

49:59.213 --> 50:01.113
I just feel weird
discussing it.

50:05.820 --> 50:07.586
Okay.
Goodnight, Alex.

50:07.622 --> 50:09.588
Goodnight, Cole.

50:33.581 --> 50:34.747
<i>"It's day five,</i>

50:34.782 --> 50:36.482
<i>"and up until a few days ago,</i>

50:36.517 --> 50:38.395
<i>"I thought the guide
who has been training me,</i>

50:38.419 --> 50:39.819
<i>"Cole Taylor,</i>

50:39.854 --> 50:43.656
<i>"was a brilliant photographer
who had nothing left to say.</i>

50:43.691 --> 50:46.158
<i>"But I'm beginning to wonder
if, perhaps like me,</i>

50:46.194 --> 50:48.427
<i>"he's let fear get in the way.</i>

50:48.463 --> 50:50.496
<i>"He's the one
holding himself back.</i>

50:50.531 --> 50:51.363
<i>"The question is...</i>

50:51.399 --> 50:53.399
<i>why?"</i>

50:54.769 --> 50:57.536
Thought you'd
be out with Alex.

50:57.572 --> 50:59.939
No, I have a lot to do.

50:59.974 --> 51:02.174
You shot
some new stuff?

51:02.210 --> 51:04.076
Oh, great!

51:04.112 --> 51:05.611
Make yourself at home.

51:05.646 --> 51:07.379
Have you told her
how you feel?

51:07.415 --> 51:10.683
Max, she has a boyfriend.

51:10.718 --> 51:13.219
Then why
isn't he here with her?

51:20.762 --> 51:23.963
These are really
good, Sarah.

51:23.998 --> 51:24.797
Oh, it's no big deal.

51:24.832 --> 51:26.632
I just thought
the kids might like 'em.

51:26.667 --> 51:28.901
I can make you one,
if you want?

51:28.936 --> 51:31.570
Oh, no. That's... That's fine.

51:32.907 --> 51:35.775
Unless you want to,
then, sure, I'll take one.

51:35.810 --> 51:37.576
So, how's it going with Cole?

51:37.612 --> 51:40.446
Yeah, it's... good.

51:40.481 --> 51:42.314
I have to admit,

51:42.350 --> 51:44.750
you and Cole training together
surprised me.

51:44.786 --> 51:46.085
Surprised me, too.

51:46.120 --> 51:48.754
We didn't really start off
on the best foot.

51:48.790 --> 51:49.989
He's a great guy.

51:50.024 --> 51:52.725
We've been friends
for a long time.

51:53.928 --> 51:55.461
There's no one more loyal
than Cole.

51:55.496 --> 51:57.663
Has he always
been this private?

51:57.698 --> 52:00.399
That's... a part of his charm.

52:01.702 --> 52:04.703
When he lets you in,
it means something.

52:07.041 --> 52:10.276
So... what should yours say?

52:11.479 --> 52:13.412
Oh, um...

52:13.447 --> 52:16.348
"I'm a worrier, not a warrior."

52:16.384 --> 52:18.984
I think
you got that backwards.

52:19.020 --> 52:20.286
Or not!

52:20.321 --> 52:21.821
All right, let's do it.

52:21.856 --> 52:24.089
How's your hip
feeling?

52:24.125 --> 52:25.925
It's a little better.

52:25.960 --> 52:27.326
Good!

52:27.361 --> 52:29.261
'Cause I have an idea.

52:29.297 --> 52:32.832
Uh... you are just full
of ideas recently, aren't you?

52:32.867 --> 52:34.934
We're just getting started.

52:40.141 --> 52:42.508
Look at that.
Built-in cushion.

52:43.644 --> 52:44.944
Oh. Oh, you're mad?

52:44.979 --> 52:46.846
Oh, I'm not mad.

52:46.881 --> 52:48.280
This is my game-face.

52:49.483 --> 52:51.150
You're going
down, Taylor.

52:51.185 --> 52:53.319
Ho, ho, ho, ho!

52:53.354 --> 52:54.453
Ready?

52:54.488 --> 52:55.788
Yeah! I'm ready.

52:57.491 --> 52:58.891
Here we go!

52:58.926 --> 53:00.025
Whoo!

53:28.189 --> 53:29.355
Come on.

53:29.390 --> 53:30.422
Let's go again!

53:30.458 --> 53:32.057
Again?

53:32.093 --> 53:33.125
That was so fun!

53:40.635 --> 53:43.002
When I was a kid,
my mom used

53:43.037 --> 53:45.437
to make us hot chocolate
on cold nights like this.

53:45.473 --> 53:47.039
Oh, that's
the best, isn't it?

53:47.074 --> 53:49.341
Oh, it's so cozy.

53:49.377 --> 53:50.109
What about you,

53:50.144 --> 53:52.011
did you have
any family traditions?

53:52.046 --> 53:54.713
Um... yeah.

53:54.749 --> 53:55.681
Yeah, actually.

53:55.716 --> 53:57.116
Yeah?

53:57.151 --> 54:00.252
My mom used to bring me
here for one week

54:00.288 --> 54:02.054
every summer
and every winter.

54:02.089 --> 54:03.289
Even back then,

54:03.324 --> 54:05.791
Ridgeline was the center
of extreme sports.

54:05.826 --> 54:08.761
So... so,
thanks to my mom,

54:08.796 --> 54:10.429
I learned
to do everything.

54:10.464 --> 54:12.398
Your mom sounds amazing.

54:12.433 --> 54:13.433
She was.

54:13.467 --> 54:16.602
Um, a real advocate
for those less fortunate.

54:18.906 --> 54:20.673
She passed away
when I was in college.

54:21.809 --> 54:23.676
I'm so sorry.

54:26.147 --> 54:27.813
So, with Max here,

54:27.848 --> 54:30.783
I decided to move
to Ridgeline.

54:32.520 --> 54:34.620
I couldn't
go back home.

54:34.655 --> 54:36.822
It just wasn't
home anymore.

54:36.857 --> 54:38.624
That must've been
really hard.

54:38.659 --> 54:40.459
I promised her

54:40.494 --> 54:42.761
that I'd pick up
where she left off.

54:42.797 --> 54:45.164
And you started
The Taylor Youth Foundation?

54:45.199 --> 54:47.566
I want to give kids
that are less fortunate

54:47.601 --> 54:49.101
the same opportunities
that I had.

54:50.538 --> 54:52.538
I bet your mom
would be really proud.

54:53.808 --> 54:55.507
Thanks.

54:55.543 --> 54:57.309
I know
I can be, um...

55:00.448 --> 55:01.747
You can take it.

55:03.784 --> 55:05.150
No, I'll just...

55:05.186 --> 55:07.186
I'll just call him back.

55:07.221 --> 55:08.988
Go on.

55:10.291 --> 55:12.825
I know I can be
private about things.

55:14.662 --> 55:16.628
The truth is...

55:16.664 --> 55:19.298
I went through a break-up
a couple years ago,

55:19.333 --> 55:21.053
and I'm just starting
to see in color again.

55:23.004 --> 55:24.370
Cole...

55:24.405 --> 55:25.637
I know
that you're worried

55:25.673 --> 55:26.972
about putting
yourself out there

55:27.008 --> 55:28.507
at the meet-and-greet,

55:28.542 --> 55:30.209
but for what it's worth,

55:30.244 --> 55:31.477
when you speak
from your heart,

55:31.512 --> 55:33.212
like you just did,

55:33.247 --> 55:35.914
you are incredibly
inspiring.

55:37.251 --> 55:38.751
Are you now the coach?

55:39.820 --> 55:41.587
Maybe.

55:52.833 --> 55:54.800
Well, before
I knew who Cole was,

55:54.835 --> 55:57.169
I really didn't think
it was that big of a deal.

55:57.204 --> 55:58.849
I thought I'd be helping
his career and mine.

55:58.873 --> 55:59.972
It was a win-win. But...

56:01.375 --> 56:02.719
<i>Now that I know
his personal story,</i>

56:02.743 --> 56:04.343
<i>I just, I know
how upset he'd be</i>

56:04.378 --> 56:06.378
if his private life went public.

56:06.414 --> 56:08.647
I-I can't keep it from him.

56:08.682 --> 56:10.983
If you tell him now,
then you risk him saying no,

56:11.018 --> 56:12.551
and then
you won't have a story,

56:12.586 --> 56:14.920
and worse, no career.

56:14.955 --> 56:16.522
I know, I...

56:16.557 --> 56:19.892
I just feel like I need to be
honest with him, regardless.

56:19.927 --> 56:21.004
Right now,
I feel like I'm lying.

56:21.028 --> 56:22.194
Wait...

56:22.229 --> 56:24.863
Do you have
feelings for him?

56:24.899 --> 56:27.833
What? No! No.
He's just a friend. No.

56:27.868 --> 56:29.568
I mean, I told Barton

56:29.603 --> 56:31.203
that I was writing
a story on Cole.

56:31.238 --> 56:33.072
And...?

56:33.107 --> 56:34.518
And he didn't think
it was a big deal.

56:34.542 --> 56:35.874
I agree with Barton.

56:35.910 --> 56:37.609
Do what makes you sleep
better at night,

56:37.645 --> 56:40.279
but I say do
what's best for the story.

56:40.314 --> 56:42.414
Right, I think
you're both right.

56:42.450 --> 56:43.916
<i>If you want,
you can send it to me.</i>

56:43.951 --> 56:45.784
I'll tell you
if you stand a chance

56:45.820 --> 56:47.386
before you dig your own grave.

56:47.421 --> 56:49.421
Thank you.
I appreciate that.

56:49.457 --> 56:50.222
Please, don't show anyone.

56:50.257 --> 56:52.057
It really is
just a first draft.

56:52.093 --> 56:54.293
Please. I'm Fort Knox.

56:54.328 --> 56:56.528
Okay.
Well, I gotta go.

56:56.564 --> 56:59.298
Cole's picking me up.
We're going skiing!

56:59.333 --> 57:00.799
What have you done
with my friend?

57:00.835 --> 57:02.534
I don't even
recognize you anymore.

57:02.570 --> 57:04.136
Trust me,

57:04.171 --> 57:06.538
in some ways,
I don't recognize me either,

57:06.574 --> 57:09.208
but, in other ways,
I finally feel like myself.

57:19.320 --> 57:21.854
You are
surprisingly calm.

57:23.724 --> 57:26.592
Well, I'm trying out
this new technique.

57:26.627 --> 57:28.107
It's called
"screaming on the inside."

57:29.230 --> 57:30.863
I see.

57:30.898 --> 57:32.197
It's working for you.

57:32.233 --> 57:34.933
That, and I figured,
if we fall...

57:34.969 --> 57:36.068
I would
just land on you.

57:38.005 --> 57:40.139
Is that your big
survival plan?

57:40.174 --> 57:42.241
Well, one of us
has to survive, right?

57:42.276 --> 57:44.143
You look like you'd
make a better cushion.

57:44.178 --> 57:46.044
Why, thanks.

57:46.080 --> 57:48.247
I appreciate the concern
for my well-being.

57:48.282 --> 57:50.215
You've had a good run.

57:50.251 --> 57:52.384
Well...

57:56.657 --> 57:58.056
Seriously, though...

57:58.092 --> 57:59.191
Thanks, Coach.

57:59.226 --> 58:01.493
I know you weren't planning
on helping me for this long,

58:01.529 --> 58:02.794
but I really
appreciate it.

58:02.830 --> 58:05.330
Ah, save the thanks
for later.

58:05.366 --> 58:07.633
You haven't gotten
your skis on yet.

58:07.668 --> 58:08.934
Mm. That's true.

58:10.738 --> 58:12.938
It's so beautiful
up here.

58:14.175 --> 58:15.908
Hey.

58:15.943 --> 58:17.242
Come on.

58:17.278 --> 58:19.011
It's time to get
the elusive Cole Taylor

58:19.046 --> 58:20.012
in a photograph.

58:20.047 --> 58:21.079
Ahh...

58:21.115 --> 58:22.247
So I can prove
to my friends

58:22.283 --> 58:24.816
that you
actually exist.

58:37.698 --> 58:40.232
If the ski hill
still intimidates you,

58:40.267 --> 58:43.368
then, uh, I haven't
done my job.

58:44.905 --> 58:45.916
You know, that's
what second chances

58:45.940 --> 58:47.339
are all about.

58:47.374 --> 58:50.075
Right.

58:50.110 --> 58:52.177
All right, last one
to the bottom buys dinner.

58:52.213 --> 58:54.379
Let's do this!

58:57.318 --> 58:59.384
Okay...

58:59.420 --> 59:01.853
Oh... forgot about these.

59:08.662 --> 59:11.196
You're doing great!

59:12.800 --> 59:15.767
Whew. I can't see.

59:15.803 --> 59:18.136
Oh.

59:18.172 --> 59:19.304
Ahh. That's so much better.

59:19.340 --> 59:20.706
Okay.

59:22.943 --> 59:25.244
That's it!

59:25.279 --> 59:28.447
Now... slide your skis together
as you turn.

59:31.819 --> 59:33.719
Hey! You're skiing!
Look at that!

59:33.754 --> 59:36.388
Olympics, here I come!

59:36.423 --> 59:38.557
Oh... Alex?

59:38.592 --> 59:40.492
Alex...
Stop, stop, stop, stop!

59:40.527 --> 59:41.426
I can't!

59:41.462 --> 59:42.561
Wah!

59:42.596 --> 59:43.829
Okay!

59:43.864 --> 59:46.265
Or you can
do that.

59:48.102 --> 59:49.601
Hey, don't knock
the snowplow.

59:49.637 --> 59:50.736
It works every single time.

59:50.771 --> 59:52.738
Ah, whoa! You okay?

59:52.773 --> 59:55.474
Yeah. I think so.

59:56.710 --> 59:58.310
I guess, uh,
you're buying dinner.

59:58.345 --> 01:00:00.979
Okay, fine.

01:00:01.015 --> 01:00:03.682
But not until after
we do your meet-and-greet.

01:00:03.717 --> 01:00:06.618
Um, you sure you don't want
to go bungee jumping instead?

01:00:06.654 --> 01:00:07.986
Nice try, Taylor.

01:00:08.022 --> 01:00:10.122
If I can face my fears,
so can you.

01:00:10.157 --> 01:00:12.090
One more run?

01:00:12.126 --> 01:00:13.258
Why not?

01:00:13.294 --> 01:00:16.628
I think I'm getting
the hang of it now.

01:00:22.903 --> 01:00:24.369
We're almost
out of hot chocolate.

01:00:24.405 --> 01:00:26.038
Max, you told me
the meet-and-greet

01:00:26.073 --> 01:00:27.384
was supposed to be
a casual thing.

01:00:27.408 --> 01:00:29.708
Well, I guess
you've got a few fans.

01:00:29.743 --> 01:00:32.344
I'll start you off,
don't worry.

01:00:32.379 --> 01:00:33.445
Start me off...

01:00:33.480 --> 01:00:34.880
Thank you all for coming!

01:00:34.915 --> 01:00:36.715
We're thrilled to have

01:00:36.750 --> 01:00:39.551
renowned nature photographer
Cole Taylor

01:00:39.586 --> 01:00:41.486
here with us
in the gallery

01:00:41.522 --> 01:00:42.988
to talk about his work.

01:00:43.023 --> 01:00:45.957
He's, uh, excited to meet you,

01:00:45.993 --> 01:00:47.826
so let's give him
a warm welcome.

01:00:50.097 --> 01:00:51.730
Remember why
you're doing this.

01:00:51.765 --> 01:00:53.965
Okay? Speak from your heart.

01:00:54.001 --> 01:00:55.500
You got this.

01:00:57.204 --> 01:00:58.837
What a great turnout.

01:00:58.872 --> 01:01:02.874
I had no idea so many of you
cared about the work I do.

01:01:02.910 --> 01:01:06.178
It means a lot to me.

01:01:06.213 --> 01:01:08.013
You know, um...

01:01:08.048 --> 01:01:10.716
coming to Ridgeline
as a young boy changed my life,

01:01:10.751 --> 01:01:12.484
and I'd like
to pay it forward.

01:01:12.519 --> 01:01:14.319
So...

01:01:14.355 --> 01:01:16.421
50% of all the sales
made this week

01:01:16.457 --> 01:01:18.256
will go
to The Taylor Youth Foundation.

01:01:21.628 --> 01:01:23.328
Thank you.

01:01:23.364 --> 01:01:26.698
So, please,
enjoy the hot chocolate.

01:01:26.734 --> 01:01:29.067
Come say hi and, um...

01:01:29.103 --> 01:01:31.570
let's change some lives,
shall we?

01:01:31.605 --> 01:01:33.872
Thank you.

01:01:35.142 --> 01:01:36.241
Whew.

01:01:36.276 --> 01:01:38.343
That was amazing!
You did so great.

01:01:39.546 --> 01:01:41.279
You did.

01:01:41.315 --> 01:01:42.514
Well, I tried
this new thing.

01:01:42.549 --> 01:01:45.550
It's called "screaming
on the inside."

01:01:45.586 --> 01:01:47.686
Oh! I think
I've heard of it.

01:01:49.490 --> 01:01:51.123
After I talk
to some of these guests,

01:01:51.158 --> 01:01:52.057
how about
that dinner?

01:01:52.092 --> 01:01:53.092
Yeah.

01:02:04.004 --> 01:02:05.937
Oh, I love this place!

01:02:05.973 --> 01:02:09.608
<i>It's time for the "These Boots
Two-Step Dance-Off"!</i>

01:02:09.643 --> 01:02:11.309
Oh, the two-step!

01:02:11.345 --> 01:02:13.745
I've always wanted to try it
in a country bar.

01:02:13.781 --> 01:02:16.148
Oh, no, no, no. I've made
a fool of myself enough today.

01:02:16.183 --> 01:02:18.250
Oh, we are
just getting started.

01:02:20.287 --> 01:02:22.888
You're gonna be good!
You're gonna be good.

01:02:22.923 --> 01:02:24.055
Oh...

01:02:49.283 --> 01:02:51.683
Wow! You're
a regular Luke Bryan.

01:02:51.718 --> 01:02:54.152
Um, well,
what can I say?

01:02:54.188 --> 01:02:55.198
When you're
raised country,

01:02:55.222 --> 01:02:57.289
it's kinda
in your bones.

01:02:57.324 --> 01:02:59.458
That wasn't
so bad, right?

01:03:02.196 --> 01:03:04.429
You are full
of surprises, New York.

01:03:04.465 --> 01:03:06.465
Well, I took a line-dance
and two-step class

01:03:06.500 --> 01:03:07.966
in college, but...

01:03:08.001 --> 01:03:09.167
In my defense,

01:03:09.203 --> 01:03:10.502
it was when
Hannah Montana's

01:03:10.537 --> 01:03:12.604
"Hoedown Throwdown"
was all the rage.

01:03:12.639 --> 01:03:13.972
All the rage?

01:03:14.007 --> 01:03:14.940
All the rage.

01:03:14.975 --> 01:03:16.041
Right!

01:03:16.076 --> 01:03:19.311
Here's
another surprise.

01:03:19.346 --> 01:03:21.613
I've had a lot of fun with you
this week.

01:03:21.648 --> 01:03:23.548
And...

01:03:23.584 --> 01:03:25.650
to top it off,
neither one of us were harmed

01:03:25.686 --> 01:03:27.452
in the making of
your adventure.

01:03:27.488 --> 01:03:29.521
Well, the night
is still young.

01:03:29.556 --> 01:03:31.857
You are a determined woman,

01:03:31.892 --> 01:03:34.559
aren't you?

01:03:34.595 --> 01:03:37.229
I'm sure you could've
convinced any guy,

01:03:37.264 --> 01:03:38.797
and he would've helped you,

01:03:38.832 --> 01:03:40.065
and...

01:03:40.100 --> 01:03:42.400
been just
as charmed.

01:03:42.436 --> 01:03:45.036
You actually
find me charming?

01:03:45.072 --> 01:03:48.139
I don't think
you see yourself clearly.

01:03:48.175 --> 01:03:50.208
You're captivating.

01:03:51.445 --> 01:03:53.845
Well... I also think
that the world

01:03:53.881 --> 01:03:56.281
could use a little bit more
of Cole Taylor.

01:04:00.387 --> 01:04:03.688
Actually, I need to talk to you
about something.

01:04:03.724 --> 01:04:05.891
My, uh, my story
that I'm writing, um...

01:04:05.926 --> 01:04:08.093
<i>And the winner</i>

01:04:08.128 --> 01:04:11.029
<i>of the "These Boots"
Dance-Off is...</i>

01:04:11.064 --> 01:04:13.198
<i>the couple in the back.</i>

01:04:16.103 --> 01:04:18.203
<i>Come on up here!
Claim the prize.</i>

01:04:18.238 --> 01:04:19.337
Oh, my gosh.

01:04:20.607 --> 01:04:22.173
You go. I'll be
right over there.

01:04:22.209 --> 01:04:24.409
No, no, no. I'll be
right with you.

01:04:28.215 --> 01:04:29.247
Steak dinners. Mm.

01:04:29.283 --> 01:04:30.949
What do you
have to say?

01:04:30.984 --> 01:04:31.850
Uh...

01:04:31.885 --> 01:04:34.352
I guess these boots
were made for dancing.

01:04:34.388 --> 01:04:37.022
Thank you!

01:04:37.057 --> 01:04:38.623
<i>And you?</i>

01:04:38.659 --> 01:04:41.626
Uh, she took the words
right out of my mouth.

01:04:41.662 --> 01:04:42.928
Women do tend
to do that,

01:04:42.963 --> 01:04:44.129
don't they?

01:04:44.164 --> 01:04:45.164
They do.

01:04:45.198 --> 01:04:46.164
<i>Well, you two
are a lovely couple.</i>

01:04:46.199 --> 01:04:48.466
<i>Enjoy those steak dinners
on us.</i>

01:04:48.502 --> 01:04:50.235
- Uh, we're actually...
- Starving!

01:05:06.520 --> 01:05:08.820
Thank you
for the ride.

01:05:08.855 --> 01:05:09.888
Hey, you never finished

01:05:09.923 --> 01:05:11.423
what you wanted
to tell me.

01:05:11.458 --> 01:05:13.158
Right.

01:05:13.193 --> 01:05:15.560
Um...

01:05:15.596 --> 01:05:16.739
Do you want to go
into the restaurant

01:05:16.763 --> 01:05:18.096
and get a hot chocolate?

01:05:18.131 --> 01:05:19.397
They make it so good,

01:05:19.433 --> 01:05:20.910
with these little
marshmallows on top.

01:05:20.934 --> 01:05:21.900
It's amazing!

01:05:21.935 --> 01:05:24.302
Well, you know my weakness
for marshmallows.

01:05:24.338 --> 01:05:25.937
I do.

01:05:25.973 --> 01:05:27.105
You're gonna love it.

01:05:27.140 --> 01:05:28.640
- All right.
- Yeah?

01:05:28.675 --> 01:05:31.309
That's a yes.

01:05:31.345 --> 01:05:32.777
I think this dance, uh...

01:05:32.813 --> 01:05:35.513
whew, had been
a while.

01:05:35.549 --> 01:05:37.082
I'll take
the Presidential Suite,

01:05:37.117 --> 01:05:39.017
if that's the best
there is available?

01:05:39.052 --> 01:05:41.353
Barton?

01:05:41.388 --> 01:05:43.121
What're you doing here?

01:05:44.291 --> 01:05:45.624
Surprising my girl.

01:05:53.400 --> 01:05:54.599
- Barton Kane.
- Hi.

01:05:54.635 --> 01:05:55.667
Alex's boyfriend.

01:05:55.702 --> 01:05:56.635
Good to meet you.

01:05:56.670 --> 01:05:58.169
I'm, uh...

01:05:58.205 --> 01:06:00.138
This is Cole Taylor.
He's my-

01:06:00.173 --> 01:06:02.073
Right. The guy you're writing
the article about.

01:06:03.477 --> 01:06:05.343
Article on me?

01:06:06.680 --> 01:06:08.480
Cole, I can explain.

01:06:08.515 --> 01:06:09.881
No. Um...

01:06:09.916 --> 01:06:11.716
You know what?
It's getting late.

01:06:11.752 --> 01:06:12.752
I should probably go.

01:06:15.489 --> 01:06:17.222
Good to meet you.

01:06:17.257 --> 01:06:18.657
I've heard
a lot about you.

01:06:18.692 --> 01:06:20.125
All good things,
I trust?

01:06:20.160 --> 01:06:21.926
Yes.

01:06:25.532 --> 01:06:26.698
Sorry.

01:06:26.733 --> 01:06:27.832
He didn't know?

01:06:27.868 --> 01:06:29.668
Of course not.

01:06:29.703 --> 01:06:31.670
I'll be right back.

01:06:37.244 --> 01:06:39.444
Cole. Cole, wait. Wait.

01:06:41.248 --> 01:06:42.888
I had no idea that
Barton was coming here.

01:06:42.916 --> 01:06:43.815
I am so sorry.

01:06:43.850 --> 01:06:45.250
So, it's true?

01:06:45.285 --> 01:06:47.085
Your article
is about me?

01:06:47.120 --> 01:06:48.820
I was trying
to tell you tonight.

01:06:48.855 --> 01:06:50.855
That's what I wanted
to talk to you about.

01:06:50.891 --> 01:06:52.524
Alex...

01:06:52.559 --> 01:06:54.399
we've been together
every day this past week...

01:06:56.096 --> 01:06:58.096
And you tried
to tell me now?

01:06:58.131 --> 01:07:01.666
I know it sounds bad,
but it's not what you think.

01:07:01.702 --> 01:07:02.867
It didn't
start out this way.

01:07:02.903 --> 01:07:03.903
My boss called me

01:07:03.937 --> 01:07:05.170
and he suggested it,

01:07:05.205 --> 01:07:06.749
and, of course, I didn't want
to write the article anymore,

01:07:06.773 --> 01:07:07.706
but I had no choice.

01:07:07.741 --> 01:07:09.541
Didn't you?

01:07:09.576 --> 01:07:11.509
I helped you...

01:07:12.813 --> 01:07:14.779
And you took
advantage of me.

01:07:14.815 --> 01:07:16.214
It isn't like that.

01:07:16.249 --> 01:07:17.716
I opened up
to you, Alex.

01:07:17.751 --> 01:07:20.218
I know.

01:07:20.253 --> 01:07:22.854
I'm sorry.

01:07:22.889 --> 01:07:24.067
You have to understand,
that I never...

01:07:24.091 --> 01:07:25.390
I think
I understand quite well.

01:07:25.425 --> 01:07:27.058
You're not

01:07:27.094 --> 01:07:29.094
the kind of person
I thought you were...

01:07:31.598 --> 01:07:33.832
And that's a shame.

01:07:38.405 --> 01:07:41.239
Goodbye, Alex.

01:07:54.421 --> 01:07:56.187
Babe?

01:07:57.958 --> 01:08:00.291
Are you okay?

01:08:00.327 --> 01:08:02.961
Why are you here, Barton?

01:08:02.996 --> 01:08:05.296
I thought
this is what you'd want.

01:08:07.167 --> 01:08:08.366
Am...
Am I missing something?

01:08:09.536 --> 01:08:12.270
It's just been
a really long day.

01:08:12.305 --> 01:08:16.341
Thank you for coming,
but I'm really tired.

01:08:16.376 --> 01:08:17.509
I just want to go to bed.

01:08:17.544 --> 01:08:20.178
I'm sorry,
I-I didn't realize...

01:08:20.212 --> 01:08:22.680
That's okay.
I know. I know.

01:08:22.716 --> 01:08:24.616
Maybe it's for the best.

01:08:24.651 --> 01:08:27.986
It means I get to have
you all to myself.

01:08:29.823 --> 01:08:31.890
Come here.

01:08:48.742 --> 01:08:51.376
Whoo!

01:08:51.411 --> 01:08:52.977
Now, that is a hike!

01:08:54.714 --> 01:08:56.548
What are you
doing way out here?

01:08:56.582 --> 01:08:58.550
I just wanted somewhere peaceful
to write.

01:08:58.585 --> 01:09:01.519
Oh, it's peaceful, all right,
but it's like "silenceville".

01:09:01.555 --> 01:09:03.220
It's creepy.

01:09:03.256 --> 01:09:05.323
Come on. I have
a surprise for you.

01:09:05.358 --> 01:09:08.626
I wanted to do something
that we've never done before.

01:09:10.063 --> 01:09:13.131
Guess.
You're never gonna guess.

01:09:13.166 --> 01:09:14.332
Heli-skiing?

01:09:14.367 --> 01:09:16.835
No. No, not even close.

01:09:16.870 --> 01:09:18.236
Bungee jumping?

01:09:18.270 --> 01:09:20.337
I can't believe
you're not guessing this.

01:09:20.372 --> 01:09:22.340
Ziplining?

01:09:22.375 --> 01:09:23.975
Is that
your idea of fun?

01:09:24.010 --> 01:09:25.710
Okay.

01:09:25.745 --> 01:09:27.145
You know what?
Forget it.

01:09:27.180 --> 01:09:28.846
It's better off
as a surprise.

01:09:28.881 --> 01:09:30.582
Now go get ready.
We gotta go.

01:09:30.617 --> 01:09:32.015
Okay.

01:09:41.528 --> 01:09:43.895
And so I told Simon,

01:09:43.930 --> 01:09:44.662
in order
to cement the deal,

01:09:44.698 --> 01:09:46.564
we need to look
at all angles,

01:09:46.600 --> 01:09:47.999
forwards
and backwards.

01:09:48.033 --> 01:09:50.667
He can be
so near-sighted sometimes.

01:09:50.703 --> 01:09:53.337
Not seeing what's
right in front of him.

01:09:54.975 --> 01:09:58.009
I think that's Cole.

01:09:59.479 --> 01:10:01.446
You didn't expect
this, did you?

01:10:03.049 --> 01:10:04.382
Sarah said
you hadn't done it.

01:10:04.417 --> 01:10:05.461
I thought it was brilliant.

01:10:05.485 --> 01:10:06.885
You talked to Sarah?

01:10:06.920 --> 01:10:08.086
Yeah.

01:10:08.121 --> 01:10:10.855
Yeah, it's a great idea.

01:10:21.968 --> 01:10:23.534
Barton, what
are you doing?

01:10:23.570 --> 01:10:26.604
I haven't been completely
honest on why I'm here.

01:10:26.640 --> 01:10:29.307
I wanted to do it this weekend
at the Berkshires,

01:10:29.342 --> 01:10:30.475
but no matter what I said,

01:10:30.510 --> 01:10:31.476
I couldn't get you
to join me there.

01:10:31.511 --> 01:10:34.112
Alex... will you marry me?

01:10:36.182 --> 01:10:37.615
Barton, that is so...

01:10:37.651 --> 01:10:39.851
Sweet? I know.

01:10:42.022 --> 01:10:43.588
Why do you want
to marry me?

01:10:43.623 --> 01:10:46.224
Because I thought
that's what you wanted, too.

01:10:46.259 --> 01:10:49.460
To take the next step
in our lives.

01:10:49.496 --> 01:10:52.897
Look. I really
care about you...

01:10:52.933 --> 01:10:54.666
and I appreciate
you coming up here

01:10:54.701 --> 01:10:56.634
and spending the time,

01:10:56.670 --> 01:10:59.938
but my travels
aren't over yet.

01:10:59.973 --> 01:11:02.273
I actually think
that they're just beginning.

01:11:02.309 --> 01:11:04.909
I don't want to marry you
for the wrong reasons,

01:11:04.945 --> 01:11:06.644
and I don't think
that you should either.

01:11:06.680 --> 01:11:08.613
You deserve someone

01:11:08.648 --> 01:11:09.580
who loves you

01:11:09.616 --> 01:11:13.184
and shares the same joys
and passions as you.

01:11:13.219 --> 01:11:16.087
I really don't think
that person is me.

01:11:17.457 --> 01:11:20.925
I just think that we're going
down two separate paths.

01:11:23.129 --> 01:11:25.263
Maybe you're right.

01:11:33.907 --> 01:11:35.673
So, when we get
up there, you guys,

01:11:35.709 --> 01:11:38.109
I want us to all...
Just a second.

01:11:38.144 --> 01:11:39.477
Cole, hey.

01:11:39.512 --> 01:11:41.112
- Hey.
- You okay?

01:11:41.147 --> 01:11:43.181
Yeah, fine.

01:11:43.216 --> 01:11:46.184
You saw
Barton and Alex?

01:11:46.219 --> 01:11:48.119
How could I miss it?

01:11:48.154 --> 01:11:50.221
I'm sorry.
Barton asked me

01:11:50.256 --> 01:11:52.423
to book the sleigh
for the proposal, and...

01:11:56.896 --> 01:11:59.130
Ah, it's not like I care.

01:11:59.165 --> 01:12:01.566
It's okay if you do.

01:12:01.601 --> 01:12:04.035
But she made her choice.

01:12:04.070 --> 01:12:06.237
I guess, um, that's that.

01:12:06.272 --> 01:12:07.538
Have fun.

01:12:13.947 --> 01:12:15.546
Alex, hey...

01:12:15.582 --> 01:12:17.415
Cole isn't here.

01:12:17.450 --> 01:12:19.150
Do you know
when he'll be back?

01:12:19.185 --> 01:12:20.685
I don't. Sorry.

01:12:22.789 --> 01:12:25.923
Well, could you give
this to him for me?

01:12:25.959 --> 01:12:27.592
Tell him it's
important, please?

01:12:27.627 --> 01:12:28.627
Sure.

01:12:36.302 --> 01:12:37.902
She came by.

01:12:37.937 --> 01:12:39.670
I told her to leave.

01:12:39.706 --> 01:12:41.272
Thank you.

01:12:41.307 --> 01:12:43.007
Why did I ask her
to leave again?

01:12:44.411 --> 01:12:46.844
She's happy.

01:12:46.880 --> 01:12:48.913
She made her choice.

01:12:48.948 --> 01:12:50.581
She's not
who I thought she was.

01:12:50.617 --> 01:12:52.116
Maybe... but you
could've at least

01:12:52.152 --> 01:12:53.751
listened to what
she had to say.

01:12:53.787 --> 01:12:57.188
It doesn't really
matter, does it?

01:12:58.725 --> 01:12:59.757
She left you this.

01:13:02.495 --> 01:13:03.928
You want me to open it?

01:13:06.332 --> 01:13:07.432
Oh, my gosh.

01:13:08.835 --> 01:13:11.035
Well, it's a check...

01:13:11.071 --> 01:13:13.504
Alex made a donation
to the foundation.

01:13:14.974 --> 01:13:17.075
...And a letter.

01:13:18.945 --> 01:13:22.046
You know what?
Just read the letter.

01:13:22.082 --> 01:13:23.748
Then you can decide
how you feel.

01:13:23.783 --> 01:13:25.716
And for the record,
she didn't look happy.

01:13:35.161 --> 01:13:37.728
Been here all week?

01:13:37.764 --> 01:13:38.896
Yeah.

01:13:38.932 --> 01:13:40.965
Great place, isn't it?

01:13:42.335 --> 01:13:45.103
How was your time
here at Ridgeline?

01:13:45.138 --> 01:13:47.505
It was everything I dreamed...

01:13:47.540 --> 01:13:50.108
and feared.

01:13:50.143 --> 01:13:52.777
Sounds like
an adventure.

01:13:52.812 --> 01:13:55.279

01:14:34.053 --> 01:14:35.620

Um, not today, sir.

01:15:19.966 --> 01:15:21.243
Well, I haven't seen
anything from her,

01:15:21.267 --> 01:15:22.533
and the deadline is now.

01:15:22.569 --> 01:15:23.779
Is she still planning to submit?

01:15:23.803 --> 01:15:25.269
I believe she isn't.

01:15:27.106 --> 01:15:28.940
Isn't that her article?

01:15:28.975 --> 01:15:31.175
Well, yes, it is.

01:15:32.345 --> 01:15:33.622
Well, why didn't
she send it to me?

01:15:33.646 --> 01:15:35.980
I think if she wanted
you to see it,

01:15:36.015 --> 01:15:38.149
she would have sent it
to you directly.

01:15:38.184 --> 01:15:39.283
Right.

01:15:39.319 --> 01:15:40.384
Well, what did you think?

01:15:40.420 --> 01:15:41.552
I thought
it was amazing.

01:15:43.756 --> 01:15:45.356

You're coming to work, right?

01:17:01.901 --> 01:17:03.567
Yeah, soon, why?

01:17:03.603 --> 01:17:05.403
Don't hate me.
He is very bossy.

01:17:05.438 --> 01:17:06.971
But I guess he is the boss.

01:17:07.006 --> 01:17:08.339
Is that how
the word was created,

01:17:08.374 --> 01:17:09.540
'cause they were bossy?

01:17:09.575 --> 01:17:12.043
Kate? What did you do?

01:17:12.078 --> 01:17:14.278
McHugh may
or may not have

01:17:14.314 --> 01:17:15.413
<i>read your article.</i>

01:17:15.448 --> 01:17:17.081
What? I told you
not to show anyone!

01:17:17.116 --> 01:17:18.683
I know.
I-I failed my mission.

01:17:18.718 --> 01:17:19.784
I'm sorry.

01:17:19.819 --> 01:17:21.118
But I think it's best

01:17:21.154 --> 01:17:22.586
<i>that you get
down here now.</i>

01:17:22.622 --> 01:17:23.754
Okay, okay.

01:17:35.968 --> 01:17:37.068
Hey.

01:17:37.103 --> 01:17:38.769
Alex, wow!
You look great.

01:17:38.805 --> 01:17:40.215
You have a glow,
like you're glowing.

01:17:40.239 --> 01:17:41.472
Alex Burns?

01:17:41.507 --> 01:17:43.574
May I see you,
please?

01:17:49.248 --> 01:17:50.281
Sir?

01:17:50.316 --> 01:17:51.316
I just wanted to say

01:17:51.351 --> 01:17:53.250
that I know
what you read,

01:17:53.286 --> 01:17:54.819
but I can assure you

01:17:54.854 --> 01:17:55.964
that it was
just a working copy.

01:17:55.988 --> 01:17:57.321
It's not nearly
near finished,

01:17:57.357 --> 01:17:59.657
if that's
even a proper sentence,

01:17:59.692 --> 01:18:03.060
and it is definitely not
representative of my best work.

01:18:03.096 --> 01:18:04.862
- Is that so?
- Yes, sir.

01:18:06.099 --> 01:18:07.431
That's very impressive then,

01:18:07.467 --> 01:18:08.632
because I thought

01:18:08.668 --> 01:18:11.635
it was one of the best articles
I've read in a long time.

01:18:11.671 --> 01:18:12.737
It was?

01:18:12.772 --> 01:18:14.672
Alex, it was poignant,

01:18:14.707 --> 01:18:15.806
powerful,

01:18:15.842 --> 01:18:18.342
self-deprecating,
honest,

01:18:18.378 --> 01:18:20.911
relatable, inspiring,

01:18:20.947 --> 01:18:22.079
and funny.

01:18:22.115 --> 01:18:23.748
Great job.

01:18:23.783 --> 01:18:24.849
I...

01:18:24.884 --> 01:18:26.951
I'm at a loss for words.

01:18:26.986 --> 01:18:29.086
Good. Because
I have more.

01:18:29.122 --> 01:18:30.421
You won, Alex.

01:18:30.456 --> 01:18:32.356
Your story

01:18:32.392 --> 01:18:34.792
will be on the cover
of next month's magazine.

01:18:34.827 --> 01:18:36.260
It will?

01:18:36.295 --> 01:18:38.062
And I couldn't be prouder.

01:18:41.234 --> 01:18:42.967
No...

01:18:43.002 --> 01:18:45.269
but... but it can't.

01:18:46.672 --> 01:18:49.173
I am so sorry, sir,

01:18:49.208 --> 01:18:51.876
but I don't have
Cole Taylor's permission

01:18:51.911 --> 01:18:53.210
to tell his story,

01:18:53.246 --> 01:18:54.246
and I assured him

01:18:54.280 --> 01:18:56.480
that I wouldn't publish anything
without his okay.

01:18:56.516 --> 01:18:58.215
That won't be necessary.

01:18:58.251 --> 01:19:00.851
But it is necessary.

01:19:00.887 --> 01:19:03.721
I-I have
a very strong moral compass,

01:19:03.756 --> 01:19:05.890
and publishing anything
without his approval

01:19:05.925 --> 01:19:06.991
would be wrong.

01:19:07.026 --> 01:19:07.992
Sir.

01:19:08.027 --> 01:19:10.995
Alex, you've suddenly
become very opinionated.

01:19:11.030 --> 01:19:13.063
And normally,
I would be offended,

01:19:13.099 --> 01:19:16.333
but I like
this newfound gumption.

01:19:16.369 --> 01:19:18.235
I received word
from Cole Taylor

01:19:18.271 --> 01:19:19.637
about an hour ago.

01:19:19.672 --> 01:19:21.005
He read your article

01:19:21.040 --> 01:19:23.507
and he sent me this note
to say...

01:19:23.543 --> 01:19:24.809
Well, why don't you read it?

01:19:28.948 --> 01:19:30.648
"This email confirms
my permission

01:19:30.683 --> 01:19:32.983

01:19:42.895 --> 01:19:44.595
"Exhilaration."

01:19:44.630 --> 01:19:46.330
What's that?

01:19:49.735 --> 01:19:52.770
I have exhilaration.

01:19:54.106 --> 01:19:55.739
Yes, I would say you do.

01:19:57.310 --> 01:19:59.610
Congratulations, Alex.

01:19:59.645 --> 01:20:01.679
You've won
a first-class ticket

01:20:01.714 --> 01:20:02.913

01:20:02.949 --> 01:20:04.782

01:20:06.552 --> 01:20:09.854
for you to join
our full-time writing staff,

01:20:09.889 --> 01:20:11.055
if you're interested.

01:20:11.090 --> 01:20:12.923
I am interested, yes!

01:20:12.959 --> 01:20:14.024
Thank you so much, sir.

01:20:20.633 --> 01:20:22.233
So, this one represents

01:20:22.268 --> 01:20:24.368
the balance between worlds.

01:20:24.403 --> 01:20:27.037
Fear...

01:20:30.910 --> 01:20:33.043
Welcome to Winter Walk.

01:20:33.079 --> 01:20:34.044
You know, I think

01:20:34.080 --> 01:20:35.724
you're supposed to get
the subject's permission

01:20:35.748 --> 01:20:36.748
before selling these.

01:20:39.285 --> 01:20:41.285
That one's my favorite.

01:20:41.320 --> 01:20:43.721
Mine, too.

01:20:43.756 --> 01:20:45.422
Cole...

01:20:45.458 --> 01:20:49.393
in one week, you have
literally changed my life.

01:20:49.428 --> 01:20:51.495
You've pushed me outside
of my comfort zone

01:20:51.531 --> 01:20:53.097
and helped me
to believe in myself,

01:20:53.132 --> 01:20:56.133
in ways I never
thought possible.

01:20:57.803 --> 01:21:01.272
I came here
to fulfill a dream...

01:21:01.307 --> 01:21:03.440
but I never imagined this.

01:21:08.047 --> 01:21:11.048
Now I can't imagine
any adventure without you.

01:21:12.552 --> 01:21:16.020
I have one last excursion
planned.

01:21:16.055 --> 01:21:17.688
If you're interested,

01:21:17.723 --> 01:21:19.957
I'll be at the top
of the Ridgeline Bridge

01:21:19.992 --> 01:21:21.625
at 3:00 p.m. today.

01:21:23.462 --> 01:21:26.163
And here.

01:21:26.198 --> 01:21:28.299
This is my prize
for winning the contest.

01:21:28.334 --> 01:21:30.634
I want you to have it,

01:21:30.670 --> 01:21:33.904
so you can keep
capturing the moments.

01:21:45.184 --> 01:21:46.624
This is what you had in mind?

01:21:48.921 --> 01:21:52.022
I thought I'd lost
my inspiration.

01:21:53.259 --> 01:21:55.793
Nothing made sense.

01:21:55.828 --> 01:21:57.461
Now I know why.

01:21:57.496 --> 01:21:59.330
I just needed to meet you.

01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:02.466
Here's a thought.

01:22:02.501 --> 01:22:03.845
What if we turned
this first-class ticket

01:22:03.869 --> 01:22:05.970
into two tickets
to Victoria Falls?

01:22:06.005 --> 01:22:09.373
I could take pictures
and you can write.

01:22:09.408 --> 01:22:12.509
We could
capture Africa's beauty

01:22:12.545 --> 01:22:14.078
and visit the elephants...

01:22:14.113 --> 01:22:16.814
together.

01:22:16.849 --> 01:22:19.883
Do I get to wear one of those
cute little safari hats?

01:22:19.919 --> 01:22:22.686
Yes, ma'am.
Yes, you do.

01:22:33.432 --> 01:22:35.232
We're doing this together.

01:22:39.972 --> 01:22:41.105
So...

01:22:41.140 --> 01:22:42.706
are you ready

01:22:42.742 --> 01:22:44.908
to take the leap
into the unknown?

01:22:44.944 --> 01:22:47.645
With you?
Always.

01:22:49.582 --> 01:22:51.515
Alex Burns...

01:22:51.550 --> 01:22:53.217
I have fallen

01:22:53.252 --> 01:22:55.919
head-over-heels
in love with you.

01:22:57.790 --> 01:23:00.257
I love you, too,
Cole Taylor.
