00:00.538 --> 00:01.902
<i>So here's what you missed
on Glee.</i>

00:01.933 --> 00:03.410
<i>Rachel went to LA to audition</i>
<i>for a TV show,</i>

00:03.422 --> 00:04.434
<i>but it was terrible and she</i>
<i>missed her performance,</i>

00:04.468 --> 00:06.228
<i>but then she found out</i>
<i>that the TV executives</i>

00:06.237 --> 00:07.771
<i>want to write a TV show</i>
<i>around her.</i>

00:07.805 --> 00:09.739
<i>Sam's a male model and</i>
<i>Mercedes' album's about to drop</i>

00:09.774 --> 00:11.074
<i>and they're still going out,</i>
<i>except Mercedes definitely</i>

00:11.108 --> 00:12.575
<i>wants to save herself</i>
<i>for marriage.</i>

00:12.610 --> 00:14.444
<i>Sassy heiress June Dolloway</i>
<i>wants to put on a showcase</i>

00:14.478 --> 00:16.980
<i>for Blaine, but Blaine lied to</i>
<i>Kurt and said he's in it, too.</i>

00:17.014 --> 00:18.974
<i>And that's what you missed</i>
<i>on</i> Glee!

00:23.519 --> 00:27.188
- Uh, there. - Oh, no, huge audition
this week for Treasure Trailz.

00:27.223 --> 00:30.291
They're kind of, like, on the
forefront of the manscaping movement.

00:30.326 --> 00:32.761
I mean, they're going all out:

00:32.795 --> 00:35.163
billboards, print, bus ads.

00:35.197 --> 00:38.433
Okay, my dream of being
almost naked on a public bus

00:38.467 --> 00:40.301
is this close to coming true.

00:40.336 --> 00:43.738
Well, you know, I'm gonna be
spray-painting "mine"

00:43.773 --> 00:45.173
Ooh.
Over all those ads.

00:45.207 --> 00:48.043
Because if I'm gonna be
out of town on this mall tour,

00:48.077 --> 00:50.178
I'm gonna need those 'rexy
models you're working with

00:50.212 --> 00:52.614
to know that you have
a girl, and she fights...

00:52.648 --> 00:53.982
- Dirty.
- Dirty.

00:54.016 --> 00:56.584
See? This is exactly what
my show needs to be about.

00:56.619 --> 00:58.887
Old friends struggling
to make it in this world.

00:58.921 --> 01:00.522
Is it normal
for a network to send

01:00.556 --> 01:02.857
a writer to hang out with
the star to figure out the show?

01:02.892 --> 01:04.759
Only when their star's
incredibly interesting.

01:04.794 --> 01:06.394
Mary Halloran is a genius.

01:06.429 --> 01:08.797
She sold her first script
when she was 14 years old.

01:08.831 --> 01:10.131
Yeah, I just don't like

01:10.166 --> 01:11.700
the idea of someone crashing
Monday night dinner.

01:11.734 --> 01:14.336
No, but the point is for her
to really see my life

01:14.370 --> 01:16.838
and understand my essence,
and you guys are so much about

01:16.872 --> 01:18.907
besides my work,
my talent and my ambition, so...

01:18.941 --> 01:20.742
Oh, here she is.
Okay, you guys, be really nice,

01:20.776 --> 01:22.610
'cause I don't want her
to feel alienated.

01:22.645 --> 01:24.946
We got to figure out a way to
invite Mary to our showcase.

01:24.980 --> 01:27.782
I mean, Rachel shouldn't be the only one
with a chance for small-screen stardom.

01:27.817 --> 01:29.117
Oh. Totally.

01:30.152 --> 01:31.353
Oh, my God!

01:31.387 --> 01:33.288
Brittany, what's happening!

01:33.322 --> 01:34.289
What up, bitches?

01:34.323 --> 01:36.024
What are you doing here?

01:36.058 --> 01:37.192
Look who's here.

01:37.226 --> 01:38.259
Hey!

01:38.294 --> 01:39.427
Brittany,

01:39.462 --> 01:41.396
I thought that
you were on Lesbian Island.

01:41.430 --> 01:42.731
No...

01:42.765 --> 01:44.099
I lost my passport and
I was trapped in the airport,

01:44.133 --> 01:45.400
like Tom Hanks in that movie.

01:45.434 --> 01:46.701
- <i>Castaway?</i>
- <i>Big?</i>

01:46.736 --> 01:48.403
- <i>The Money Pit?</i>
- Okay, it was <i> Castaway.</i>

01:48.437 --> 01:50.205
So, where's Santana?

01:50.239 --> 01:52.540
Oh, uh, she's shooting
a Yeast-I-Stat commercial

01:52.575 --> 01:54.209
in Iowa for a week.

01:54.243 --> 01:55.777
Apparently, they had the best

01:55.811 --> 01:57.846
wheat fields
to slow-motion-run through.

01:57.880 --> 01:59.314
She didn't call and tell you?

01:59.348 --> 02:01.950
No. I gave up my cell phone
after Kiki and I and broke up.

02:01.984 --> 02:03.084
The pain was too great.

02:03.119 --> 02:04.386
Hello?

02:04.420 --> 02:08.122
Hello? I'm Mary Halloran.

02:08.157 --> 02:09.958
- Yes.
- Oh, is that Chinese food?

02:09.991 --> 02:12.794
Just the smell of it
gives me the Lady Di's.

02:12.828 --> 02:15.096
Oh, I'm s... Hello.
I am Rachel Berry.

02:15.131 --> 02:16.972
It is so nice to meet you.
Let me introduce you

02:16.999 --> 02:18.733
to my friends... Oh,
no, no, don't bother.

02:18.768 --> 02:20.135
I have a thing about names.

02:20.169 --> 02:21.903
Oh.
Jonathan says it's

02:21.937 --> 02:23.138
a form of narcissism,

02:23.172 --> 02:25.473
but I think it's related
to my anxiety disorder.

02:25.508 --> 02:26.748
Ooh, who's-who's Jonathan?

02:26.776 --> 02:28.410
He's my Tuesday-Thursday shrink.

02:28.444 --> 02:30.645
At least I think
that's his name. You know,

02:30.680 --> 02:32.947
that wonton smell's going
straight to my tummy.

02:32.982 --> 02:35.650
Bathroom. Now.
It-It's right there.

02:35.685 --> 02:36.951
Okay.

02:38.854 --> 02:41.589
Oh, I'm really excited
to be working with you,

02:41.624 --> 02:42.824
by the way, Randy.

02:42.858 --> 02:44.392
It's gonna be a blast.

02:46.636 --> 02:49.502

<font color="#40bfff">www.Addic7ed.com</font>

02:49.832 --> 02:53.568
Okay, let's start writing!

02:54.704 --> 02:57.939
"The Untitled Mary Halloran

02:57.974 --> 02:59.541
Project."

02:59.575 --> 03:00.608
Yes!

03:00.643 --> 03:02.410
So...

03:02.445 --> 03:04.479
tell me about yourself.

03:04.513 --> 03:06.448
Well, let's see, uh,
I-I have two gay dads.

03:06.482 --> 03:07.782
Amazing!

03:07.817 --> 03:08.883
We can use that!

03:08.918 --> 03:09.884
Oh, good. Okay.

03:09.919 --> 03:11.453
Do they work for NASA?

03:11.487 --> 03:12.654
No, they don't.

03:12.688 --> 03:13.655
Gay...

03:13.689 --> 03:15.023
NASA...

03:15.057 --> 03:16.791
- dads.
- N... Uh...

03:16.826 --> 03:18.193
So, you're a senior?

03:18.227 --> 03:22.197
Um, yes, I-I started out in
my high school glee club, so...

03:22.231 --> 03:23.732
Irrelevant!

03:23.766 --> 03:25.266
We <i> can't</i> use that.

03:25.301 --> 03:27.669
Oh. I'm so sorry. The a
capella thing is so over.

03:27.703 --> 03:29.037
But you're on Broadway.

03:29.071 --> 03:29.971
Yeah!

03:30.006 --> 03:31.206
Uh! What's that like?

03:31.240 --> 03:33.842
It's amazing.
Um, I-I do eight shows

03:33.876 --> 03:35.877
a week, so it's a little,
you know, tiring, but...

03:35.911 --> 03:37.145
Lazy.

03:37.179 --> 03:37.912
I'm sorry?

03:39.181 --> 03:40.649
Is this, like, your process?

03:40.683 --> 03:43.752
Mm! What is Mary-bot's process?

03:43.786 --> 03:45.253
Does not compute.

03:45.288 --> 03:47.589
Meh! Meh! Meh! Meh!

03:47.623 --> 03:48.857
Okay. Um...

03:48.891 --> 03:50.859
so, how-how did you...

03:50.893 --> 03:52.294
start writing?

03:52.328 --> 03:54.696
Well, my freshman year

03:54.730 --> 03:56.598
at Princeton, I wrote a version

03:56.632 --> 03:58.733
of <i> The Diary of Anne Frank,</i>

03:58.768 --> 04:02.470
where Anne was played by
an upright Oreck vacuum cleaner.

04:02.505 --> 04:04.940
It transferred to New York,
where I won an Obie,

04:04.974 --> 04:07.409
and then I got
a MacArthur Genius Grant.

04:07.443 --> 04:08.877
- Oh, wow.
- Oh!

04:08.911 --> 04:10.946
I'm so bored!
Too much work!

04:10.980 --> 04:12.781
Can I use your bathroom?

04:12.815 --> 04:14.282
I'm not gonna pee.

04:14.317 --> 04:16.551
I'm just gonna snoop
through the cabinets.

04:16.586 --> 04:20.355
But before you say anything,
remember that it's Opposite Day.

04:20.389 --> 04:22.524
Yes?

04:22.558 --> 04:24.092
Thank you.

04:25.285 --> 04:27.405
Miss Jones,
here we are with the launch

04:27.430 --> 04:29.230
of your nationwide tour
of shopping malls.

04:29.265 --> 04:32.133
As you look ahead to a summer
of autograph signings

04:32.168 --> 04:34.269
and mall appearances
and glamorous events

04:34.303 --> 04:36.504
at Marriott Hotels
across our great, great country,

04:36.539 --> 04:37.706
how do you feel?

04:37.740 --> 04:39.074
You know, I feel
absolutely amazing.

04:39.108 --> 04:41.076
We're gonna meet up
with Santana in Reno,

04:41.110 --> 04:44.112
and I even got the label
to bring along my girl Brittany

04:44.146 --> 04:45.614
as my star backup dancer.

04:45.648 --> 04:47.115
We're gonna be
like Charlie's Angels!

04:47.149 --> 04:48.850
I get to be Farrah...
no arguments.

04:48.884 --> 04:51.419
I'm the Angel that torches
stuff with her laser eyes.

Blaine.

07:24.273 --> 07:25.574
Come.

07:25.608 --> 07:27.943
- I brought BabyCakes.
- Oh.

07:30.079 --> 07:32.013
- What were you doing up there?
- Oh, I like

07:32.048 --> 07:34.088
to measure the stage
to see how many paces

07:34.116 --> 07:35.684
I have in each direction...
that way

07:35.718 --> 07:37.519
if I decide to freestyle,

07:37.553 --> 07:39.955
I won't fall on my ass
into the crowd.

07:39.989 --> 07:41.623
Oh.

07:41.657 --> 07:44.292
You know, success depends
on three things.

07:44.327 --> 07:47.729
It depends on talent,
hard work and... luck,

07:47.763 --> 07:50.899
and if you have the first two, you
won't have to worry about the third.

07:50.933 --> 07:52.300
Oh. Who said that?

07:52.335 --> 07:54.269
Me. Just now.

07:54.303 --> 07:55.637
All right.

07:55.671 --> 07:59.207
Should I seat Michael Bay
next to Walter Cronkite?

07:59.242 --> 08:01.943
Uh, I'm pretty sure
Walter Cronkite died.

08:01.978 --> 08:03.345
Oh. That's sad.

08:03.379 --> 08:04.813
It's okay, don't
worry about Walter...

08:04.847 --> 08:07.082
he had a fantastic life.

08:07.116 --> 08:09.251
And he made great Manhattans.

08:09.285 --> 08:11.786
It's not Walter.
It's... it's Kurt.

08:11.821 --> 08:13.555
I've... been
carrying around

08:13.589 --> 08:15.724
this lie that he's
gonna be in the showcase.

08:15.758 --> 08:18.393
Can we just give him one song?
Enough.

08:18.427 --> 08:21.830
Blaine, I am putting the most
valuable currency I have

08:21.864 --> 08:25.500
into this event, and that
currency is my reputation.

08:25.535 --> 08:28.770
All the people come here
because I am their taste-maker.

08:28.805 --> 08:30.872
And my palate...

08:30.907 --> 08:33.073
is undeniable when
it comes to talent,

08:33.109 --> 08:36.010
and I cannot jeopardize
my track record because

08:36.044 --> 08:38.145

Well, I brought you lunch,

but it looks like
you already had dessert.

11:12.001 --> 11:13.268
That was nice.

11:13.302 --> 11:15.262
Are you gonna put that
in the showcase?

11:15.271 --> 11:17.639
June doesn't
want you in the showcase.

11:17.673 --> 11:20.108
And she never did.

11:22.912 --> 11:25.714
So, you've been lying
to me this whole time?

11:25.748 --> 11:26.882
I thought I could convince her,

11:26.916 --> 11:28.250
and then they wouldn't
be lies anymore.

11:28.284 --> 11:30.352
I love you.

11:30.386 --> 11:32.421
How am I supposed to believe
that you love me if I can't even

11:32.455 --> 11:33.655
- trust you?
- I did it <i> because</i> I love you.

11:33.689 --> 11:35.657
You lied to me!

11:35.692 --> 11:37.192
We had long conversations
about this.

11:37.226 --> 11:38.326
I didn't know what else to do.

11:38.361 --> 11:39.361
I didn't want
to hurt your feelings.

11:39.395 --> 11:43.131
I... I am...
I am so, so sorry.

11:43.166 --> 11:45.000
Yeah, I bet you are.

11:45.034 --> 11:47.636
Too bad I can't believe
in anything else you say.

11:57.287 --> 11:59.254
What is with the rubber band?

11:59.289 --> 12:01.723
Um...

12:01.758 --> 12:03.792
Just, it's been a while since
I've been intimate with a girl,

12:03.803 --> 12:06.471
so I ***

12:06.496 --> 12:08.230
Oh, I know what you mean.
It's been, like,

12:08.264 --> 12:09.965
nine hours since got laid.
I'm going nuts.

12:12.466 --> 12:14.946
All right, cattle kids.

12:14.971 --> 12:16.672
Listen up.
I'm Charlie Darling,

12:16.706 --> 12:18.407
and you're all here
on zero notice

12:18.441 --> 12:22.211
because there's an advertising
crisis over at the...

12:22.245 --> 12:23.645
Treasure Trailz campaign.

12:23.680 --> 12:26.048
Their big model got sent
to prison for running

12:26.082 --> 12:28.116
an underground teacup
dog-fighting ring in Miami.

12:28.151 --> 12:29.618
They have billboards
set to launch

12:29.652 --> 12:31.453
in a few days, so it's time

12:31.487 --> 12:35.123
for a new
Treasure Trailz coverboy.

12:35.158 --> 12:37.092
We're going to do this
fast, and we're gonna

12:37.126 --> 12:38.260
do it dirty. Walk.

12:38.294 --> 12:39.862
If you can't get into my jeans

12:39.896 --> 12:41.697
with your walk,
then you don't have it.

12:41.731 --> 12:43.332
I brought some girls

12:43.366 --> 12:45.000
to help set the mood.

12:45.034 --> 12:49.004

Uh, Sam Evans.

14:48.925 --> 14:51.794
Sam, you are seriously
buzzing with sex.

14:51.828 --> 14:54.396
Uh, maybe it's just
'cause I'm a little backed up.

14:54.431 --> 14:56.265
My, uh, girlfriend and I...

14:56.299 --> 14:58.200
we're waiting
till we get married.

14:58.234 --> 15:00.235
Whatever it is, it's working.

15:00.270 --> 15:02.565
Come back tonight for the shoot.

15:02.600 --> 15:05.235
Everything about you just
screams Treasure Trailz.

15:12.643 --> 15:14.377
What's this?

15:14.412 --> 15:16.613
We need to have
a little girl talk.

15:16.647 --> 15:17.847
It's about Sam.

15:17.882 --> 15:20.950
Are you gonna break up with him
before you go on tour?

15:20.985 --> 15:23.486
Sam, I think you need to
break it off with Mercedes.

15:23.521 --> 15:25.121
It's just the
gentlemanly thing to do.

15:25.156 --> 15:27.023
We love each other.

15:27.058 --> 15:28.658
You're going to be traveling
all over the country,

15:28.693 --> 15:29.793
meeting tons of people.

15:29.827 --> 15:30.860
Guys are gonna be, like,

15:30.895 --> 15:31.928
throwing themselves at you.

15:31.962 --> 15:33.697
Listen, I've got my posse

15:33.731 --> 15:35.165
and my Jesus.

15:35.199 --> 15:36.599
I can resist temptation!

15:36.634 --> 15:37.901
But Sam can't.

15:37.935 --> 15:39.769
Sam is cool with the whole

15:39.804 --> 15:41.037
waiting until marriage thing.

15:41.072 --> 15:43.206
He barely even thinks
about it anymore.

15:43.240 --> 15:44.974
It's all I think about.

15:45.009 --> 15:47.410
Like today, there were
all these boobs all around me,

15:47.445 --> 15:49.612
and I almost passed out...
but I didn't.

15:49.647 --> 15:51.381
I controlled it.

15:51.415 --> 15:52.782
Okay, I'm not gonna lie.

15:52.817 --> 15:55.585
It is scary, worrying about what
the person you love is doing

15:55.619 --> 15:56.987
while you're
a million miles away,

15:57.021 --> 15:58.154
but it's worth the risk.

15:58.189 --> 16:00.423
And Sam respects me.

16:00.458 --> 16:03.226
And if that makes me a romantic
and not a realist,

16:03.260 --> 16:06.062
well, that's the way that
I'm choosing to live my life.

16:06.097 --> 16:09.032
Look, guys,
I'm committed to Mercedes, okay?

16:09.066 --> 16:11.301
She's the one.
I'm not gonna screw it up.

16:11.335 --> 16:12.402
Look, being in love

16:12.436 --> 16:14.838
is amazing,
and when you have it,

16:14.872 --> 16:16.773
it's terrifying to let it go,

16:16.807 --> 16:19.175
but sometimes the best chance
you have of staying together

16:19.210 --> 16:20.944
is by being apart for a while.

16:23.981 --> 16:26.483
Ow.

16:26.517 --> 16:29.786
Rachel's one of those people
that, when she sets a goal,

16:29.820 --> 16:31.621
she doesn't stop
until she gets it.

16:31.656 --> 16:33.823
I've never met anyone...

16:34.859 --> 16:37.027
Did you just put
a donut in your bra?

16:37.061 --> 16:39.429
Maybe?

16:41.065 --> 16:43.033
Did you want this one?

16:45.903 --> 16:47.904
So, are we gonna begin, or...?

16:48.906 --> 16:51.074
I love your attitude,

16:51.108 --> 16:53.076
and I'm okay with your loafers.

16:53.110 --> 16:55.278
We're gonna have
to change your name, though.

16:55.313 --> 16:58.114
Do you prefer Slaine or Fane?

16:58.149 --> 17:00.917
I'm sorry.
Are you an actual writer

17:00.952 --> 17:03.019
from a real-life
television network?

17:03.054 --> 17:05.387
Shoop shoop!
Shoop shoop da-doop!

17:05.423 --> 17:08.925
Can I just say that you are
a breath of fresh air,

17:08.960 --> 17:11.394
and I love your pajamas?

17:11.429 --> 17:13.430
Don't steal my pajamas!

17:13.464 --> 17:15.498
Little mousies
live in the pockets!

17:15.532 --> 17:16.900
Amazing.

17:16.934 --> 17:18.902
All right.

17:18.935 --> 17:21.137
And a kitty lives in my pants.

17:23.540 --> 17:25.675
Rachel, that chick is insane.

17:25.710 --> 17:27.377
I think she's amazing.
When Mary and I spoke

17:27.411 --> 17:30.046
telepathically, I told her
I'd watch any show she created.

17:30.081 --> 17:32.248
If you go out for that TV
show, you're going to have

17:32.283 --> 17:33.583
to burn a lot of bridges.

17:33.618 --> 17:35.385
Sidney Greene even said
he's gonna blackball you

17:35.419 --> 17:37.187
if you missed another
performance. What is he gonna do

17:37.221 --> 17:38.822
when he finds out
you're quitting on him?

17:38.823 --> 17:41.324
Shh! Look, if I do this TV show,
then I can, like,

17:41.359 --> 17:43.793
come back to New York afterwards
and do any show I want

17:43.828 --> 17:45.429
for, like, ten times
the amount of money.

17:45.463 --> 17:47.697
Understood,
but if you're making that bet,

17:47.732 --> 17:49.432
I wish you'd bet on your voice,

17:49.467 --> 17:51.868
not some crazy psychopath
who eats couch cushions.

17:51.902 --> 17:53.570
The armrest is
the sweetest meat.

17:53.604 --> 17:55.772
Look, you're the star
of the show,

17:55.806 --> 17:57.073
but you have to trust

17:57.108 --> 17:59.709
your instincts, not hers.

17:59.744 --> 18:02.412
Okay, you guys, welcome to
the first informal read-through

18:02.446 --> 18:05.515
of the <i> Untitled</i>
<i>Mary Halloran Project.</i>

18:05.549 --> 18:07.550
So, I will be playing
the role of Rachel.

18:07.585 --> 18:09.185
Blaine, you'll be
playing Slaine,

18:09.220 --> 18:10.954
and Brittany, you'll be
playing Nittany.

18:10.988 --> 18:12.856
I'm guessing I'm Jam?

18:12.890 --> 18:14.424
- Blartie?
- Yes.

18:14.458 --> 18:16.893
Cert? I'm Cert,
like the breath mint.

18:16.928 --> 18:18.128
Let's start with scene one.

18:18.162 --> 18:20.430
Interior Cert
and Rachel's apartment.

18:20.464 --> 18:23.533
"Rachel eats a full sheet cake
in a bathtub,

18:23.568 --> 18:26.069
thinking about her gay dads
who work for NASA."

18:26.103 --> 18:27.537
Um...

18:27.572 --> 18:28.939
Hey.

18:28.973 --> 18:30.273
Hey, where did you get
that dinosaur suit?

18:30.308 --> 18:33.343
I found it in a Dumpster
in the Bronx, so I put it on,

18:33.377 --> 18:36.379
but then I was afraid it might
have lice, so I took it off,

18:36.414 --> 18:38.548
but then I missed having it on,
so I put it back on.

18:38.583 --> 18:41.184
O-M-G-R-O-F-L-W-T-H.

18:41.218 --> 18:44.220
My stupid gay NASA dads forgot
that today was my birthday,

18:44.255 --> 18:46.575
and I know that they're on the
International Space Station,

18:46.591 --> 18:48.625
but I, like, never even
forget their anniversary.

18:48.659 --> 18:50.493
Hashtag D-B-E-Y-R.

18:50.528 --> 18:53.396
Hashtag D-I-L-L-I-G-A-S.

19:00.638 --> 19:02.405
Why don't we move
to, uh, scene 12?

19:02.440 --> 19:04.341
That was weird.

19:04.375 --> 19:06.042
That was <i> uber</i> weird.

19:06.077 --> 19:08.712
It is so wrong that we just
slept together. Uber wrong.

19:08.746 --> 19:10.113
I'm gay, and you're
mostly lesbian,

19:10.147 --> 19:11.348
but here's what I'm thinking.

19:11.382 --> 19:13.016
I know what
you're going to say.

19:13.050 --> 19:16.419
Okay, let's just say it at the
same time at the count of three.

19:16.454 --> 19:17.988
One, two, three.

19:18.022 --> 19:19.289
Let's keep sleeping together

19:19.323 --> 19:20.423
and start an art gallery

19:20.458 --> 19:21.958
in the performance space
downstairs!

19:21.993 --> 19:23.326
- Oh. Mmm.
- Mmm.

19:23.361 --> 19:24.261
Um...

19:24.295 --> 19:26.162
Okay, well, why...

19:26.197 --> 19:27.464
why don't we, uh,

19:27.498 --> 19:31.268
move onto... Rachel's
impromptu birthday rave?

19:33.371 --> 19:35.038
What's going on?

19:35.072 --> 19:37.007
It's a rave. Coffee rave!

19:37.041 --> 19:38.608
What?
It's a coffee rave!

19:38.643 --> 19:39.876
Everybody's drinking coffee.

19:39.911 --> 19:42.445
Why coffee?
I don't know.

19:42.480 --> 19:44.147
No one's here.

19:44.181 --> 19:45.615
It's the worst
coffee rave ever.

19:45.650 --> 19:46.850
It's for Rachel!

19:46.884 --> 19:48.652
Her gay astronaut dads
forgot her birthday.

19:48.686 --> 19:51.054
She sort of has an issue with
people forgetting birthdays.

19:51.088 --> 19:53.189
For a while, she went
to therapy about it.

19:53.224 --> 19:55.458
I'm-I'm sorry. Can we stop?

19:55.493 --> 19:57.794
The speech goes on
for, like, six more pages.

19:57.828 --> 19:59.729
I don't even see
any punctuation.

19:59.764 --> 20:02.365
Everyone keeps stopping just
when I start getting into it.

20:02.400 --> 20:03.700
This doesn't make any sense.

20:03.734 --> 20:05.035
Yeah, I sort of called that.

20:05.069 --> 20:06.636
Girl, you're gonna have
to do something.

20:06.671 --> 20:09.639
You're right,
and Kurt was right, too.

20:10.875 --> 20:12.108
If I'm going to do this,

20:12.143 --> 20:15.212
it's going to be my show,
or no show at all.

20:22.823 --> 20:25.324
They're full of diseases.

20:26.626 --> 20:29.106
Pretty hard to dance at your
showcase with bumblefoot.

20:30.697 --> 20:32.531
Humans can't get bumblefoot.

20:34.835 --> 20:37.269
And I don't want
to do the showcase anymore.

20:37.304 --> 20:41.040
You are more important
to me than anything.

20:43.134 --> 20:45.654
What do you think it's like
to fly for the first time?

20:45.679 --> 20:47.747
I mean, here you are
up in this nest,

20:47.781 --> 20:49.315
which is the only
home you've ever known,

20:49.349 --> 20:52.251
and even though your DNA and
millions of years of evolution

20:52.285 --> 20:54.120
are telling you
that if you jump,

20:54.154 --> 20:56.022
you won't hit the
ground like a stone,

20:56.056 --> 20:58.157
you can never really know.

20:58.191 --> 21:00.826
Relationships are like that.

21:00.861 --> 21:04.096
You give someone your
heart to look after,

21:04.131 --> 21:07.266
and you tell yourself
that you're safe, but...

21:07.300 --> 21:08.901
you never know if
today or tomorrow

21:08.935 --> 21:11.637
is going to be the day that
they drop it like a stone.

21:11.672 --> 21:13.673
Kurt, I'm really,
really, really sorry.

21:13.707 --> 21:15.274
I get what happened.

21:15.308 --> 21:18.210
The way that I was talking
about the showcase...

21:18.245 --> 21:20.780
there's no way that I would have
been cool with not being in it.

21:20.814 --> 21:22.181
I would have lied to me, too.

21:22.215 --> 21:23.416
I don't understand.

21:23.450 --> 21:24.784
If you're not mad at me,

21:24.818 --> 21:26.419
then where are you going
with all this flying stuff?

21:26.453 --> 21:28.554
Oh, no, I-I was mad.

21:28.588 --> 21:33.693
Then I realized that
trust is a choice.

21:35.095 --> 21:37.663
You know, every day, we're
going to roll out of bed,

21:37.698 --> 21:39.398
and send each other
into the world,

21:39.433 --> 21:42.301
just trusting that we
have each other's backs.

21:42.336 --> 21:45.638
And we will slip up,
and-and we will be scared,

21:45.672 --> 21:48.107
but I choose to trust

21:48.141 --> 21:50.910
and to love you
through everything.

21:51.945 --> 21:54.080
Thank you.

21:54.114 --> 21:56.749
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you. Thank you.

21:56.783 --> 21:58.551
Uh, I love you so much.

21:58.585 --> 22:00.286
I-I mean what I said
about the showcase.

22:00.320 --> 22:02.388
Either we fly together,
or we don't fly at all.

22:02.422 --> 22:04.423
I am very happy for you.

22:04.458 --> 22:06.592
And I'm very excited
the world gets

22:06.626 --> 22:07.826
to see you spread your wings.

22:08.996 --> 22:10.396
Now it's your turn to fly.

22:10.430 --> 22:11.564
Thank you.

22:12.833 --> 22:16.335
I don't know if it's all
this bird talk, but...

22:16.370 --> 22:17.837
I'm getting a little turned on.

22:17.871 --> 22:19.305
Let's go inside.

22:19.339 --> 22:22.074
Hey, hey, hey.

22:22.109 --> 22:24.410
I'm the luckiest guy
in the world.

22:24.444 --> 22:26.445
Yeah, pretty much.

22:28.112 --> 22:30.592
You know, we have,
uh, plain donuts here.

22:30.617 --> 22:32.918
I prefer the misery
of doing it this way,

22:32.953 --> 22:34.387
earning it.

22:34.421 --> 22:36.589
Yeah, see, that's sort of
what I mean about the show.

22:36.623 --> 22:38.891
You know, which is
genius, by the way.

22:38.925 --> 22:40.760
Thank you.

22:40.794 --> 22:42.261
I just think the
character of Rachel

22:42.295 --> 22:43.396
doesn't really sound like me.

22:43.430 --> 22:45.331
She... sounds like you.

22:45.365 --> 22:47.667
I know TV.

22:47.701 --> 22:49.835
People want antiheroes.

22:49.870 --> 22:51.971
They want chubby girls
who can't keep men

22:52.005 --> 22:53.639
and men who kill people.

22:53.674 --> 22:55.641
And that's great. I just...
I thought that Mr. Paulblatt

22:55.676 --> 22:57.376
wanted to make a show
that was about me.

22:57.411 --> 22:59.451
I know the kinds of shows
he greenlights...

22:59.479 --> 23:02.581
they all have the one thing
you lack: irony.

23:02.616 --> 23:05.751
When I was in the glee club
and I had to explain something,

23:05.786 --> 23:08.120
it always helped me
to do it through song.

23:10.857 --> 23:12.825
Oh... God, no.

23:12.859 --> 23:14.694
I just want
to show you my essence.

23:14.728 --> 23:16.362
I don't know
how to write a script,

23:16.396 --> 23:18.631
but I know
how I want it to feel.

I was watching you and I was
like, "What is this feeling?"

25:48.348 --> 25:49.982
Right? It's so unfamiliar.

25:50.017 --> 25:51.584
What was it?

25:51.618 --> 25:53.586
I think it was happy.

25:53.620 --> 25:55.588
That's never happened
to me before.

25:56.723 --> 25:58.090
I think you're right.

25:58.125 --> 26:00.693
Maybe there is a show in making
people not hate themselves.

26:00.727 --> 26:01.961
You mean it?

26:01.995 --> 26:04.297
A-And, you know,
you'll make her sound like me?

26:04.331 --> 26:07.366
Well, they'll never make it, but
I'll give your version a shot.

26:07.401 --> 26:08.834
Oh, my God. Thank you so much.

26:08.869 --> 26:10.469
Okay, I'm gonna give you
a hug now.

26:10.504 --> 26:11.737
Oh. Wow.

26:12.656 --> 26:14.616
Now can you leave?
I need to shame-eat.

26:14.641 --> 26:16.842
Oh. Yeah. Okay.

26:21.679 --> 26:24.235
Okay, good. Yeah, just... Yeah.

26:24.270 --> 26:25.837
Give me a little more sex,
a little more sex.

26:25.871 --> 26:26.838
A little more heat. Come on.

26:26.872 --> 26:28.373
Chocolate.
Banana.

26:28.407 --> 26:30.075
Give it to me, give it to me.
Just tighten the abs

26:30.109 --> 26:32.544
a little bit. There you go.
Just look over this way.

26:32.578 --> 26:34.679
No, not all the way. I don't like that.
I don't like that. Ass?

26:34.714 --> 26:36.281
Can you just give me more sex?
You know? Feel it.

26:36.315 --> 26:37.282
Yeah.

26:38.918 --> 26:40.385
This isn't working.

26:40.419 --> 26:41.853
No, I hate everything.
I hate everything.

26:41.887 --> 26:43.855
Sam, where's my sex buzz?

26:43.889 --> 26:45.624
You didn't get laid today,
did you?

26:45.658 --> 26:48.126
No, it's-it's... your...

26:48.160 --> 26:50.261
your assistant is...

26:50.296 --> 26:51.529
looking at me kind of funny.

26:51.564 --> 26:53.431
Is one of your nipples
higher than the other?

26:53.466 --> 26:55.300
It's...
weirding me out.

26:55.334 --> 26:58.270
Okay. Enough, enough.
Everybody out. Out.

27:04.677 --> 27:06.444
Okay.

27:07.980 --> 27:10.949
Do you want a beer?

27:10.983 --> 27:12.984
I'm-I'm... I'm nine-nineteen.

27:13.019 --> 27:15.220
I won't tell your mom.

27:16.656 --> 27:18.356
What are you feeling?

27:18.391 --> 27:21.226
Um...

27:21.260 --> 27:23.795
well, if I was a soup,

27:23.829 --> 27:26.898
I would probably be minestrone.

27:26.933 --> 27:28.233
Keep talking.

27:28.267 --> 27:30.402
I like your honesty.
So does the camera.

27:30.436 --> 27:33.071
Uh...

27:33.105 --> 27:35.473
Well...

27:35.508 --> 27:38.009
you're really hot,
so there's that.

27:39.045 --> 27:41.046
There's definitely that.

27:42.515 --> 27:45.283
But I...

27:45.318 --> 27:46.451
I love my girlfriend.

27:46.485 --> 27:48.445
The one who doesn't have sex
with you?

27:51.324 --> 27:53.758
Um... y...

27:53.793 --> 27:55.760
I-I'm also feeling

27:55.795 --> 27:57.963
kind of scared.

27:57.997 --> 27:59.464
Of me?

27:59.498 --> 28:02.033
Well, it's just that this job
is really important to me.

28:02.068 --> 28:03.935
It's a dream come true.

28:03.970 --> 28:05.804
I'm just worried that if I don't
give you what you want

28:05.838 --> 28:07.472
I-I might lose it.

28:07.506 --> 28:08.707
What do you think I want?

28:09.742 --> 28:11.042
Hmm?

28:12.345 --> 28:14.145
I'm gonna tell you something

28:14.180 --> 28:17.148
to leave out of your minestrone
of emotions:

28:17.183 --> 28:18.516
guilt.

28:20.720 --> 28:23.154
There's nobody here.

28:23.189 --> 28:25.757
We can do whatever we want.

28:25.791 --> 28:27.692
And nobody has to know.

28:37.837 --> 28:39.804
Hey, my sexy working man.

28:39.839 --> 28:42.674
Look. I got us a bunch
of binge foods to celebrate.

28:53.886 --> 28:56.354
Babe, what's wrong?

28:59.492 --> 29:01.426
I'm so sorry.

29:02.728 --> 29:05.330
I cheated on you.

29:08.234 --> 29:11.937
I was at my shoot and this
photographer was all over me

29:11.971 --> 29:13.772
and it was so intense.

29:13.806 --> 29:16.708
It was like that scene in <i> Fame,</i>
and she just... kissed me.

29:16.742 --> 29:18.843
And...

29:18.878 --> 29:20.612
and then what happened?

29:20.646 --> 29:22.347
I got so upset I started crying

29:22.381 --> 29:24.816
and then she took some photos
of me crying in my underwear

29:24.850 --> 29:26.685
and then I just left.

29:28.754 --> 29:30.689
Sam, you didn't cheat on me.

29:31.120 --> 29:33.000
It's not
like you kissed her back.

29:33.025 --> 29:35.060
Well, like,
I kind of sort of did

29:35.094 --> 29:36.962
but it was just, like, one
of those reflex reactions

29:36.996 --> 29:38.063
that you have
when someone kisses you.

29:38.097 --> 29:39.377
Like, kind of, you know, like...

29:40.266 --> 29:42.601
- See? Like that.
- Ugh.

29:42.635 --> 29:45.537
I can't do this to you anymore.

29:45.571 --> 29:49.407
Sam, I-I love you so much.

29:49.442 --> 29:52.143
But I'm looking
at my life, and...

29:52.178 --> 29:55.480
I don't think I'm gonna be ready
until I'm, like, 30.

29:55.514 --> 29:57.415
And asking you to wait that long

29:57.450 --> 30:00.085
is like asking a cheetah
not to run.

30:00.119 --> 30:02.687
It's okay.
I'm okay with it. I...

30:02.722 --> 30:05.090
Yeah, it's-it's hard, but...

30:06.710 --> 30:09.070
I just have this feeling that
we're meant to be together.

30:09.095 --> 30:12.397
Yeah, who's to say
that we're not?

30:12.431 --> 30:15.133
Y-You think
I'm gonna cheat on you?

30:15.167 --> 30:17.535
No, actually,

30:17.570 --> 30:19.738
I think you won't.

30:20.906 --> 30:23.475
And I think you'll
resent me for it.

30:23.509 --> 30:25.810
And I think
that we're holding on

30:25.845 --> 30:27.479
way too tight

30:27.513 --> 30:29.547

in our love

30:29.582 --> 30:31.449

30:33.319 --> 30:38.657
It's gonna burn me

30:39.659 --> 30:43.261

this is the right thing.

30:46.933 --> 30:49.234

whoever I'm with
or whatever I'm doing,

30:52.772 --> 30:54.839
I'd rather be doing it with you.

30:58.344 --> 30:59.978
Hey.

31:00.012 --> 31:01.980
Hey. Just...

31:06.252 --> 31:07.919
Let's make a deal.

31:07.954 --> 31:09.588
If I...

31:09.622 --> 31:13.858
if I do decide to change
my mind and not wait,

31:13.893 --> 31:16.027
I'll give you a call.

31:16.062 --> 31:19.397

my benefactor, June Dolloway.

34:32.630 --> 34:34.864

that talent is worthless

back it up with passion.

34:36.766 --> 34:38.935
And so I'd like
to use that passion

34:38.969 --> 34:41.438
to pick my last song.

34:41.472 --> 34:45.007
Because there is nothing
I am more passionate about...

34:45.042 --> 34:47.210
than my fiancé.

34:48.779 --> 34:50.447

34:50.481 --> 34:52.601
would you like to sing

I-I just had to.

No, no, no.
You two were terrific.

June, thank you so much.
Thank you, really.

37:33.477 --> 37:34.477
Thank you for all of this.

37:34.512 --> 37:36.646
Don't ever let anyone...
even me...

37:36.681 --> 37:38.648
make you doubt
what you're sure of.

37:38.683 --> 37:39.749
Okay.

37:39.784 --> 37:42.185
You. Come. Stand.

37:42.220 --> 37:43.920
Okay.

37:43.955 --> 37:46.456
You remind me of
my third marriage.

37:46.490 --> 37:47.624
My husband was gay, too.

37:47.658 --> 37:49.125
True love.

37:51.295 --> 37:52.629
Okay, let's have a party.

37:52.663 --> 37:54.798
- Yeah.
- Oh.

37:54.832 --> 37:56.800
Party!

37:59.147 --> 38:01.925
Thing about love is that
it's not a scarce resource.

38:01.950 --> 38:03.784
The more you give,
the more you have to give."

38:03.818 --> 38:04.785
Aw.

38:04.819 --> 38:07.721
- Yay.
- Yay, I love it.

38:07.755 --> 38:10.297
Do you guys like it?

38:10.331 --> 38:11.665
I can walk in the script.

38:11.699 --> 38:13.033
Well, she's handing it in
to the network, so...

38:13.067 --> 38:14.167
we should hear soon.

38:14.202 --> 38:15.902
The other one was better.

38:15.937 --> 38:16.837
You know, I always thought

38:16.871 --> 38:18.205
that Fanny was the role

38:18.239 --> 38:19.406
that I was born to play,

38:19.440 --> 38:20.974
but then I read this.

38:21.008 --> 38:22.175
This is it.

38:22.210 --> 38:24.211
This is my dream role,
you guys, and thank you

38:24.245 --> 38:25.812
so much for pushing me
to get it right.

38:25.847 --> 38:27.080
A toast.

38:27.114 --> 38:29.015
To two glorious years in
the greatest city on earth.

38:29.050 --> 38:31.618
Cheers to that. Cheers.
Cheers to that.

38:31.652 --> 38:34.132
So very much. Holy crap.

38:34.971 --> 38:36.532
What...?

38:36.557 --> 38:38.859
Oh, my God.

38:38.893 --> 38:41.261
Oh, my God.
 Oh, my God, Sam,

38:41.295 --> 38:42.829
I am so proud of you.

38:42.864 --> 38:44.531
I did it. I made
my dream come true.

38:44.565 --> 38:47.400
Look at this. Ah.
The abs, the...

38:47.435 --> 38:49.436
the nipples are even.
Oh, my gosh, this is great.

38:49.470 --> 38:51.671
It is the start
of a great career.

38:51.706 --> 38:53.707
Nope. It's the finish.

38:53.741 --> 38:56.610
I came out here to get my
junk on the side of a bus

38:56.644 --> 38:58.912
and I did it.

38:58.946 --> 39:00.213
Going out on top

39:00.248 --> 39:01.414
Or on the side, really.

39:01.449 --> 39:03.016
What are you gonna do now?

39:03.050 --> 39:05.485
I think I'm gonna go back home.
I just want to be in a space

39:05.520 --> 39:07.187
where, you know,
the only sounds I hear at night

39:07.221 --> 39:08.655
are the crickets
and the rendering plant.

39:08.689 --> 39:09.956
My mind just works better when

39:09.991 --> 39:11.391
everything's a little slower.

39:11.425 --> 39:13.693
Plus, everybody here is
just scattering, anyway, so...

39:17.565 --> 39:19.966
It's the end of another era
for us Glee kids.

39:20.001 --> 39:22.269
Yeah.

39:23.971 --> 39:26.873
Yeah. It's been quite
a year, you guys.

39:28.242 --> 39:30.710
Finn and the Glee Club...

39:30.745 --> 39:33.246
I don't think I can really
handle losing anything else.

39:33.281 --> 39:35.015
Who said that you
have to lose anything?

39:35.049 --> 39:37.184
No, he's right.
It's like the end of an era.

39:37.218 --> 39:38.652
Sam said it...
we're all gonna be

39:38.686 --> 39:41.254
scattered all over the place
soon. I mean, you do realize

39:41.289 --> 39:43.356
that if I get this TV show,
it'll be the first time

39:43.391 --> 39:45.725
that we're apart in five years.

39:45.760 --> 39:47.194
Well, I think if
we can get through that,

39:47.228 --> 39:48.328
our friendship
can survive anything.

39:48.362 --> 39:49.930
Oh.

39:49.964 --> 39:52.499
Kurt's right. I'm in this with
you guys for the long haul.

39:52.533 --> 39:54.253
Okay, then,
you know what, you guys?

39:54.268 --> 39:55.735
Let's make a deal.

39:55.770 --> 39:57.737
Six months from now,
we all come back,

39:57.772 --> 39:59.339
right here, to this place,

39:59.373 --> 40:02.509
because I'm gonna need
something to look forward to.

40:02.543 --> 40:04.177
If I've learned
anything this year,

40:04.212 --> 40:06.913
it's that you guys are my life.

40:06.948 --> 40:08.315
Let's hug it out. Come on.

40:08.349 --> 40:09.716
Yes, yes, yes.
Let's do it.

40:09.750 --> 40:11.117
Bring it in!

40:12.687 --> 40:15.589
