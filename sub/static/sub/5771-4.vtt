THE WEEK AFTER A BREAKUP
IS THE WORST.

00:04.238 --> 00:06.107
[sobbing]
* HE SLEPT A SUMMER

00:06.140 --> 00:11.279
* BY MY SIDE

00:11.312 --> 00:12.346
* HE FILLED MY DAYS
AND LASTLY,

00:12.380 --> 00:16.317
I WILL HAVE ONE ORDER
OF THE GLASS NOODLE SALAD.

00:16.350 --> 00:19.287
WHAT DO YOU MEAN I DON'T FULFILL
THE DELIVERY MINIMUM?

00:19.320 --> 00:21.655
[tearfully] I USED TO.
* HE TOOK MY CHILDHOOD

00:21.689 --> 00:27.095
* IN HIS STRIDE

00:27.128 --> 00:31.499
* BUT HE WAS GONE
WHEN AUTUMN CAME *

00:31.532 --> 00:35.303
SMILING, SERIOUS,
KISSING,

00:35.336 --> 00:36.804
CHARLIE'S ANGELS.

00:36.837 --> 00:40.108
CLASSIC PHOTO BOOTH
BIG FOUR.

00:40.141 --> 00:43.844
* COME TO ME

00:43.877 --> 00:47.281
* THAT WE WOULD LIVE
THE YEARS TOGETHER *

00:47.315 --> 00:48.482
EXCUSE ME.

00:48.516 --> 00:50.218
OW!

00:50.251 --> 00:51.252
DAMN IT!

00:51.285 --> 00:55.323
WHO PUT THIS STUPID BOX HERE?

00:55.356 --> 00:57.325
CLIFF GILBERT,
ATTORNEY AT LAW.

00:57.358 --> 00:58.426
WHO DOES THAT?

00:58.459 --> 01:00.694
I KNEW I SHOULDN'T HAVE
COME TO WORK.

01:00.728 --> 01:02.363
WHICH IS WHEN I TRIPPED
AND FELL

01:02.396 --> 01:05.566
ON YOUR STUPID BOX
OF FISH OILS.

01:05.599 --> 01:07.368
YEAH, I OPENED IT.

01:07.401 --> 01:08.569
SO I HOPE
YOU'RE A GOOD LAWYER,

01:08.602 --> 01:09.670
BECAUSE I PLAN ON SUING.

01:09.703 --> 01:10.671
OKAY.

01:10.704 --> 01:11.705
I HAVE A COUPLE THOUGHTS.

01:11.739 --> 01:12.773
NICE TO MEET YOU,
BY THE WAY.

01:12.806 --> 01:13.774
I'M CLIFF.

01:13.807 --> 01:15.843
NOW, I COULD SUE YOU FOR
TAMPERING WITH MY MAIL,

01:15.876 --> 01:17.311
BECAUSE THAT'S
A FEDERAL OFFENSE.

01:17.345 --> 01:18.379
SINCE WHEN?

01:18.412 --> 01:19.580
SINCE, LIKE, 1820.

01:19.613 --> 01:20.881
UH, I DO THAT
ALL THE TIME.

01:20.914 --> 01:22.383
WELL, YOU SHOULDN'T.

01:22.416 --> 01:23.717
IF SOMEBODY GETS
AN INTERESTING LOOKING MAIL,

01:23.751 --> 01:25.686
YOU DON'T OPEN IT
TO SEE WHAT'S IN IT?
NO, I DON'T.

01:25.719 --> 01:27.421
NEITHER DO I.

01:27.455 --> 01:28.356
BUT I AM SO CURIOUS.

01:28.389 --> 01:30.458
WHO IS IT THAT YOU THINK
THAT YOU COULD SUE?

01:30.491 --> 01:32.326
UH, YOU,
THIS LAW FIRM.

01:32.360 --> 01:33.327
THE MAKERS OF

01:33.361 --> 01:34.728
FATSTEPS
WEIGHT LOSS SNEAKERS.

01:34.762 --> 01:36.597
THEIR SPOKESPERSON,
BROOKE BURKE,

01:36.630 --> 01:39.300
HER HUSBAND,
DAVID CHARVET, AND--
OKAY, OKAY.

01:39.333 --> 01:40.401
LET ME JUST STOP YOU
RIGHT THERE.

01:40.434 --> 01:41.669
IN SLIP-AND-FALL CLAIMS,

01:41.702 --> 01:43.604
A PLAINTIFF, YOU,

01:43.637 --> 01:44.905
HAS TO PROVE GROSS NEGLIGENCE

01:44.938 --> 01:46.574
ON THE PART OF THE DEFENDANT,

01:46.607 --> 01:47.575
ME.

01:47.608 --> 01:48.809
NOW, I CAN ONLY ASSUME

01:48.842 --> 01:49.843
YOU WEREN'T LOOKING
WHERE YOU WERE GOING

01:49.877 --> 01:51.279
BECAUSE YOU CLEARLY WEREN'T
LOOKING IN THE MIRROR

01:51.312 --> 01:52.079
WHEN YOU GOT DRESSED
THIS MORNING.

01:52.112 --> 01:54.315
UH, HOW DARE YOU?
I'M ADORABLE.

01:54.348 --> 01:56.317
I LOOK LIKE KEIRA KNIGHTLEY
RUNNING ERRANDS.

01:56.350 --> 01:57.285
GUYS LOVE THIS LOOK.

01:57.318 --> 01:59.353
NOT THAT I'M INTERESTED
IN GUYS RIGHT NOW,

01:59.387 --> 02:00.388
'CAUSE I'M GOING
THROUGH A BREAKUP.

02:00.421 --> 02:01.455
WAIT A MINUTE.
YOU'RE SINGLE?

02:01.489 --> 02:03.257
I FIND THAT IMPOSSIBLE.

02:03.291 --> 02:05.493
NOW YOU'RE ALWAYS WEARING
FATSTEPS IN THE RAIN,

02:05.526 --> 02:06.760
OUTSIDE OF A CONTROLLED
EXERCISE ENVIRONMENT,

02:06.794 --> 02:08.262
SO I THINK THE JUDGE
HEARS THAT,

02:08.296 --> 02:10.231
FINDS THE PLAINTIFF
TO BE NEGLIGENT

02:10.264 --> 02:11.732
AND CLEARLY INSANE.

02:11.765 --> 02:12.900
CASE CLOSED.

02:12.933 --> 02:14.735
HAVE A WONDERFUL DAY,
EVERYONE.

02:14.768 --> 02:15.936
YOU THINK YOU'RE
SO COOL,

02:15.969 --> 02:17.271
WITH ALL YOUR LEGAL TALK,

02:17.305 --> 02:18.739
PACING AROUND
IN YOUR EXPENSE PANTS.

02:18.772 --> 02:19.973
I CAN DO THAT TOO.

02:20.007 --> 02:21.742
GUESS WHAT? I'VE SEEN
LEGALLY BLONDE NINE TIMES.

02:21.775 --> 02:22.743
I SAW IT ON BROADWAY.

02:22.776 --> 02:23.744
I READ THE NOVELIZATION.

02:23.777 --> 02:25.346
I HAVE THE APP.

02:25.379 --> 02:27.381
[glass shatters]

02:28.682 --> 02:31.319
MEANT TO DO THAT.

02:31.352 --> 02:32.886
SO...

02:32.920 --> 02:34.388
HAVE A NICE LIFE, LOSER.

02:34.422 --> 02:35.356
[thud]

02:35.389 --> 02:38.326
OKAY, YOU HAVE A ONLINE
SHOPPING PROBLEM.

02:38.359 --> 02:40.328
[upbeat music]

02:40.361 --> 02:48.369
*

02:53.741 --> 02:55.676
(Jeremy)
EVERYBODY, GATHER AROUND.

02:55.709 --> 02:57.611
IT SEEMS RATHER SILLY TO ME

02:57.645 --> 03:00.214
THAT WE WORK AT A PLACE CALLED
SHULMAN AND ASSOCIATES

03:00.248 --> 03:01.949
WHEN THERE'S NO ONE CALLED
SHULMAN HERE.

03:01.982 --> 03:03.317
I THOUGHT HE
WAS SHULMAN.

03:03.351 --> 03:04.518
I'M CASTELLANO.

03:04.552 --> 03:05.719
FOR REAL?

03:05.753 --> 03:07.488
AND WITH THE ADDITION
OF DR. PETER PRENTICE,

03:07.521 --> 03:09.957
IT SEEMED HIGH TIME
TO HAVE A NEW NAME.

03:09.990 --> 03:13.294
IS THE NEW DOCTOR--
IS THAT SET IN STONE?

03:13.327 --> 03:14.295
IS THIS ANYBODY'S
SANDWICH?

03:14.328 --> 03:15.296
BECAUSE I'VE EATEN
HALF OF IT,

03:15.329 --> 03:16.597
AND I DON'T LIKE IT.

03:16.630 --> 03:19.233
NO, DANNY,
IT'S NOT SET IN STONE.

03:19.267 --> 03:22.603
IT'S SET IN LUCITE!

03:22.636 --> 03:24.772
I GIVE YOU,
PEERSON, CASTELLANO,

03:24.805 --> 03:26.874
REED & PRENTICE.

03:26.907 --> 03:29.009
WAIT, WHO'S PEERSON?

03:29.042 --> 03:30.578
I DON'T KNOW NONE
OF Y'ALL PEOPLE.

03:30.611 --> 03:33.314
MINDY IS MRS. CASEY PEERSON,

03:33.347 --> 03:34.915
OR AT LEAST SHE WILL BE
WHEN SHE GETS MARRIED.

03:34.948 --> 03:36.950
YEAH, CASEY AND I MIGHT
NOT BE GETTING MARRIED.

03:36.984 --> 03:38.352
WHAT?

03:38.386 --> 03:39.353
IT DIDN'T MAKE SENSE
TO GET MARRIED

03:39.387 --> 03:40.354
ONCE WE HAD BROKEN UP, SO...

03:40.388 --> 03:41.355
WHAT?

03:41.389 --> 03:42.256
BUT YOU MUST.

03:42.290 --> 03:43.857
FOR THE SIGN.

03:43.891 --> 03:45.459
DID HE LEAVE YOU
FOR A WHITE WOMAN?

03:45.493 --> 03:46.760
THAT'S EXACTLY WRONG,

03:46.794 --> 03:48.562
AND PLEASE DON'T
GRAB ME LIKE THAT.

03:48.596 --> 03:50.698
HOLD ON.
WAS IT A BLACK MAN?

03:50.731 --> 03:51.699
NO.

03:51.732 --> 03:53.901
LOOK, I'VE BEEN ON THE
OTHER SIDE OF THIS A LOT,

03:53.934 --> 03:55.336
DUMPING CHICKS.

03:55.369 --> 03:57.338
I THINK WHAT YOU'VE
GOT TO KNOW IS THAT

03:57.371 --> 03:58.339
HE HAD HIS REASONS,

03:58.372 --> 03:59.540
AND IT'S BETTER THIS WAY.

03:59.573 --> 04:02.576
OR AT LEAST IT'S BETTER
THIS WAY FOR HIM.

04:02.610 --> 04:03.677
OKAY, I BARELY KNOW YOU,

04:03.711 --> 04:05.846
AND YOU HAD YOUR HAND ON ME
FOR, LIKE, 20 MINUTES.

04:05.879 --> 04:06.847
HEY, GUYS,

04:06.880 --> 04:08.048
OBVIOUSLY I'M REALLY SAD

04:08.081 --> 04:09.983
AND I'M IN NO CONDITION
TO WORK.

04:10.017 --> 04:12.686
SO I'M GOING TO TAKE
MY HEARTACHE DAYS,

04:12.720 --> 04:15.489
AND I'LL BE BACK HERE
WHEN I FEEL BETTER.

04:15.523 --> 04:16.957
YEAH, WE DID ACTUALLY
TALK ABOUT THIS.

04:16.990 --> 04:18.459
YOU DON'T GET
HEARTACHE DAYS.

04:18.492 --> 04:20.561
IN FACT,
THEY DON'T EXIST.

04:28.369 --> 04:29.570
OH, HEY, DR. L.

04:29.603 --> 04:31.872
TALK TO YOU ABOUT
MY LOVE LIFE STAT.

04:31.905 --> 04:33.907
HEY, DO YOU REMEMBER
MY EX-GIRLFRIEND, VICKI?

04:33.941 --> 04:34.808
NO.

04:34.842 --> 04:36.009
OKAY, WELL, ANYWAY,
SHE JUST GOT ENGAGED

04:36.043 --> 04:37.345
TO AN ENGINEER,

04:37.378 --> 04:38.546
AND NOT
THE CHOO-CHOO KIND.

04:38.579 --> 04:39.580
THE RICH KIND.

04:39.613 --> 04:41.014
AND THE CRAZY THING IS,

04:41.048 --> 04:42.816
THIS IS THE SEVENTH TIME
THIS HAS HAPPENED.

04:42.850 --> 04:44.051
EVERY TIME I DATE A GIRL,

04:44.084 --> 04:45.118
THE MINUTE WE BREAK UP,
BAM,

04:45.152 --> 04:48.088
SHE MEETS SOME AMAZING GUY
AND THEY FALL IN LOVE.

04:48.121 --> 04:49.390
MORGAN, I THINK YOU'RE
DESCRIBING THE PREMISE

04:49.423 --> 04:50.691
TO GOOD LUCK CHUCK.

04:50.724 --> 04:52.660
UM, I'VE NEVER SEEN
THAT FILM.

04:52.693 --> 04:54.662
I MIGHT BE TOO
YOUNG FOR THAT.

04:54.695 --> 04:56.063
ANYWAYS, WHAT DO I DO?

04:56.096 --> 04:56.864
IS THERE SOMETHING--

04:56.897 --> 04:58.366
SHOULD I CALL THEM
AND BE LIKE--

04:58.399 --> 04:59.166
HEY, MORGAN, MORGAN.

04:59.199 --> 05:00.133
I'M REALLY SEARCHING
FOR THE PASSION

05:00.167 --> 05:02.436
TO CONTINUE MY INTEREST
IN THIS CONVERSATION,

05:02.470 --> 05:03.537
BUT I'M VERY SAD,

05:03.571 --> 05:05.105
SO I'M GOING TO GO
EAT MY SNACK.

05:05.138 --> 05:06.407
SO I'M GOING TO
GO DO THAT, OKAY?

05:06.440 --> 05:08.342
I TRIED.
OKAY.

05:08.376 --> 05:10.077
(Danny)
MRS. RANDOLPH,
WATER BIRTHS HAVE NO

05:10.110 --> 05:11.612
PROVEN MEDICAL BENEFITS.

05:11.645 --> 05:12.580
THEY GET A LOT OF PUBLICITY

05:12.613 --> 05:13.581
BECAUSE OF CELEBRITIES--

05:13.614 --> 05:14.648
YOUR RICKI LAKES
AND WHATNOT--

05:14.682 --> 05:16.116
BUT, YOU KNOW WHAT?

05:16.149 --> 05:17.117
LET'S TALK ABOUT THIS LATER.

05:17.150 --> 05:18.552
OKAY?
OKAY.

05:18.586 --> 05:19.987
OKAY.
GOOD TO SEE YOU.

05:20.020 --> 05:22.556
PETER! PETER!

05:22.590 --> 05:24.024
WHAT'S GOING ON
IN HERE, GUYS?

05:24.057 --> 05:25.158
DR. P.'S DOING
THE CINNAMON CHALLENGE.

05:25.192 --> 05:27.595
IF YOU CAN SWALLOW A SPOONFUL
OF CINNAMON, YOU WIN.

05:27.628 --> 05:29.597
OH, MY GOD.
CAN'T YOU DIE FROM THAT?

05:29.630 --> 05:30.764
WHAT DO YOU WIN?

05:30.798 --> 05:33.066
OH!

05:33.100 --> 05:34.368
RESPECT.

05:39.440 --> 05:40.574
DANNY, YOU SMELL
DELICIOUS,

05:40.608 --> 05:42.943
LIKE A CUP OF CIDER
I CAN'T WAIT TO SIP.

05:42.976 --> 05:44.945
PETER'S GOT TO GO.
IT'S NOT WORKING OUT.

05:44.978 --> 05:46.380
COME ON.
HE'S A GREAT DOCTOR.

05:46.414 --> 05:47.915
THE PATIENTS LOVE HIM.

05:47.948 --> 05:49.116
PLUS, HE'S THE ONLY ONE
AROUND HERE

05:49.149 --> 05:51.118
WHO CALLS ME "BOSS,"
WHICH I LIKE.

05:51.151 --> 05:52.453
HE CALLS EVERYONE BOSS,

05:52.486 --> 05:55.389
OR CHIEF
OR LITTLE BUDDY,

05:55.423 --> 05:56.824
WHICH MAKES NO
SENSE AT ALL.

05:56.857 --> 05:58.426
YEAH,
NO SENSE AT ALL.

05:58.459 --> 05:59.059
I THOUGHT YOU TWO
WOULD GET ON.

05:59.092 --> 06:01.028
YOU'RE BOTH AMERICAN DUDES.

06:01.061 --> 06:02.396
WE'RE NOTHING LIKE
EACH OTHER, OKAY?

06:02.430 --> 06:05.065
HE WEARS CARGO SHORTS.
I WEAR SLACKS.

06:05.098 --> 06:07.134
HE SURFS.

06:07.167 --> 06:09.169
I FEAR THE OCEAN
OUT OF RESPECT.

06:09.202 --> 06:10.471
OKAY, WELL,
GUESS WHAT, DANNY?

06:10.504 --> 06:11.772
I HIRED HIM
WHEN YOU AND MINDY

06:11.805 --> 06:14.508
BOTH LEFT ME IN
THE LURCH, REMEMBER?

06:14.542 --> 06:15.509
YEAH.

06:15.543 --> 06:16.510
GET OUT OF MY OFFICE.

06:16.544 --> 06:17.578
YOU SMELL LIKE A CANDLE SHOP

06:17.611 --> 06:18.979
DURING THE HOLIDAYS.

06:19.012 --> 06:22.115
(Peter)
JOYCE, HAPPY TO SEE YOU.

06:22.149 --> 06:22.983
NOT SO HAPPY WITH YOU.

06:23.016 --> 06:24.852
HEARD YOU MISSED
A CHILDBIRTH PREP CLASS.

06:24.885 --> 06:26.487
THAT CAN'T HAPPEN.

06:26.520 --> 06:28.522
IF IT DOES, I WILL
THROW YOU IN BABY JAIL.

06:28.556 --> 06:29.623
NOW, I'M KIDDING,

06:29.657 --> 06:31.559
BUT I'M ALSO BEING
REALLY SERIOUS.

06:31.592 --> 06:33.961
HEY, BOSS.
LITTLE BUDDY.

06:33.994 --> 06:36.530
SEE? HE'S GOT
THE HUMAN TOUCH.

06:36.564 --> 06:39.166
* A LONG DECEMBER

06:39.199 --> 06:41.435
* AND THERE'S REASON
TO BELIEVE *

06:41.469 --> 06:42.870
[glass shatters]

06:42.903 --> 06:46.807
* MAYBE THIS YEAR
WILL BE BETTER THAN THE LAST *

06:46.840 --> 06:48.542
DON'T BE SAD, GIRL.

06:48.576 --> 06:49.943
I MISS YOU TOO.

06:49.977 --> 06:51.445
CASEY. HI!

06:51.479 --> 06:53.447
HI, CASEY, IT'S MINDY.
HI!

06:53.481 --> 06:54.682
YOU'RE--ARE YOU OKAY?

06:54.715 --> 06:55.683
YEAH, YEAH,
I'M OKAY.

06:55.716 --> 06:57.017
I MEAN, I'M SHRUNKEN

06:57.050 --> 06:58.218
INTO, LIKE, A MINIATURE
VERSION OF MYSELF,

06:58.251 --> 06:59.219
SO...

06:59.252 --> 07:01.489
WELL...

07:01.522 --> 07:02.990
NOT COMPLETELY MINIATURE.

07:03.023 --> 07:03.991
[laughs]

07:04.024 --> 07:05.993
THAT IS JUST HILARIOUS.

07:06.026 --> 07:07.495
YOU BEEN DRINKING
A LITTLE BIT?

07:07.528 --> 07:09.096
YEAH.

07:09.129 --> 07:12.065
I DON'T WANT TO FEEL THIS WAY
ANYMORE, CASEY.

07:12.099 --> 07:14.234
I JUST WANT TO FAST-FORWARD
THROUGH ALL OF MISSING YOU,

07:14.267 --> 07:17.004
AND I WANT TO BE
HAPPY AGAIN.

07:17.037 --> 07:18.872
MAYBE GOING TO THE GYM
WOULD HELP.

07:18.906 --> 07:20.574
OKAY, PHOTO ME.

07:20.608 --> 07:23.210
WHY DON'T YOU BACK OFF,
YOU STUPID SKANK?

07:23.243 --> 07:24.177
YEAH, I WENT THERE.

07:24.211 --> 07:25.679
[pounding on door]

07:25.713 --> 07:26.547
IT'S MORGAN!

07:26.580 --> 07:29.049
THE WHITE NURSE
FROM WORK!

07:29.082 --> 07:30.217
[British accent]
MINDY'S NOT HERE
RIGHT NOW.

07:30.250 --> 07:33.554
DON'T YOU
MRS. DOUBTFIRE ME!

07:33.587 --> 07:35.823
I SAW HOW UPSET YOU
WERE EARLIER.

07:35.856 --> 07:36.824
NO!
GET OUT OF THE WAY.

07:36.857 --> 07:37.825
GOD.
COME ON.

07:37.858 --> 07:39.226
NO, I BROUGHT
YOU STUFF, OKAY,

07:39.259 --> 07:40.794
BECAUSE YOU'RE
HAVING A BAD DAY.

07:40.828 --> 07:42.262
I BROUGHT TREATS.

07:42.295 --> 07:44.231
I GOT YOUR RAG MAGS.

07:44.264 --> 07:45.666
I PREFER TO BE LEFT
ALONE RIGHT NOW,

07:45.699 --> 07:46.667
BECAUSE I'M REALLY SAD.

07:46.700 --> 07:47.668
THEY DIDN'T HAVE
ICE CREAM,

07:47.701 --> 07:48.669
SO I GOT SOUR CREAM.

07:48.702 --> 07:49.703
THOUGHT WE COULD ADD
SOME SUGAR

07:49.737 --> 07:51.605
AND HOPE FOR THE BEST.

07:51.639 --> 07:53.206
OKAY.

07:53.240 --> 07:54.842
LOOK, I GET IT.

07:54.875 --> 07:55.943
OKAY, WE ARE SAD.

07:55.976 --> 07:57.978
ALL RIGHT,
CASEY AND YOU BROKE UP.

07:58.011 --> 08:01.148
MY OLD GIRLFRIEND
GOT ENGAGED.

08:01.181 --> 08:02.850
THAT'S RIGHT,

08:02.883 --> 08:04.117
'CAUSE EVERYONE
WHO DATES YOU

08:04.151 --> 08:07.187
FINDS THE PERFECT
PERSON RIGHT AFTER.

08:07.220 --> 08:10.123
MINDY, THIS IS A LOT
OF EMPTY WINE BOTTLES.

08:10.157 --> 08:11.925
MORGAN.
WHAT'S GOING ON?

08:11.959 --> 08:13.894
USE YOUR MAGIC ON ME.

08:13.927 --> 08:15.929
WHAT? WHAT?
OH!

08:17.765 --> 08:18.566
(Mindy)
COME ON, MORGAN!

08:18.599 --> 08:19.366
JUST BE MY BOYFRIEND
FOR THE NIGHT!

08:19.399 --> 08:20.768
DO WE HAVE
A CHEMICAL ATTRACTION?

08:20.801 --> 08:21.935
YES, OF COURSE.

08:21.969 --> 08:23.604
DO I OCCASIONALLY THINK ABOUT
YOU IN YOUR YOGA PANTS?

08:23.637 --> 08:24.605
CONSTANTLY.

08:24.638 --> 08:25.706
THEN LET'S JUST DO THIS THING

08:25.739 --> 08:26.874
AND RELEASE ME
FROM THIS HELL!

08:26.907 --> 08:28.241
OH!
OH, GOD.

08:28.275 --> 08:29.242
YOU SAID YOU WERE MAGIC.

08:29.276 --> 08:30.744
NO, NO,
NO, NO, NO.

08:30.778 --> 08:31.745
AAH!

08:31.779 --> 08:32.813
OH, MY GOD.

08:32.846 --> 08:34.181
I'M SO SORRY.

08:34.214 --> 08:36.650
YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE SAYING.

08:36.684 --> 08:37.685
YOU'RE DRUNK.

08:37.718 --> 08:39.052
NO, NO--
NO, NO, NO. STOP.

08:39.086 --> 08:40.654
AAH!
STOP IT.

08:40.688 --> 08:41.689
STOP IT.
STOP IT.

08:41.722 --> 08:42.823
WHY WOULD YOU
LET ME STOP IT?

08:42.856 --> 08:44.558
YOU GOT TO CALM DOWN.
SHH.

08:44.592 --> 08:46.727
QUIET. QUIET.
QUIET.

08:46.760 --> 08:48.562
THERE WE GO.
DOWN.

08:48.596 --> 08:50.698
LET ME--
NO, NO.

08:50.731 --> 08:53.200
IT'S OVER.
IT'S OVER.

08:53.233 --> 08:55.068
MORGAN...

08:55.102 --> 08:57.705
IF THERE IS ANY CHANCE
THAT YOUR POWER IS REAL,

08:57.738 --> 08:59.239
I NEED TO TRY.

08:59.272 --> 09:00.874
I'M SO SAD.

09:00.908 --> 09:05.078
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO DO.

09:05.112 --> 09:06.146
[sobbing]
NO.

09:06.179 --> 09:07.314
YOU CRYING IS THE ONE THING

09:07.347 --> 09:09.049
ON THIS EARTH I CAN'T TAKE.

09:11.919 --> 09:14.154
ALL RIGHT,
I'LL DO IT.

09:14.187 --> 09:15.756
WHAT?

09:15.789 --> 09:17.991
I'LL WORK MY MAGIC...

09:18.025 --> 09:21.729
BY HAVING SEX
WITH YOUR BODY.

09:21.762 --> 09:22.696
SO I'M OUT WITH THIS CHICK,

09:22.730 --> 09:25.065
SUPER SMART AND CLASSY,

09:25.098 --> 09:26.700
MAJOR CANS.

09:26.734 --> 09:28.268
MAJOR CANS?

09:28.301 --> 09:29.302
DANNY,
IT'S A LOCKER ROOM.

09:29.336 --> 09:30.771
HE'S A TELLING
A CHAP STORY.

09:30.804 --> 09:31.939
SO WE'RE ON A DOUBLE DATE,
YOU KNOW,

09:31.972 --> 09:34.107
SO THERE'S NO
AWKWARD SILENCES.

09:34.141 --> 09:35.142
HEY, DANNY,
COME SIT DOWN.

09:35.175 --> 09:36.376
YOU PRETEND TO BE ME.

09:36.409 --> 09:38.045
NO, THANK YOU.
GO ON, MATE.
COME ON, SIT DOWN.

09:38.078 --> 09:39.046
BONDING.

09:39.079 --> 09:40.748
IT'LL HELP WITH THE STORY.

09:40.781 --> 09:41.782
JUST PRETEND TO ME.
I'LL BE THE CHICK.

09:41.815 --> 09:42.883
IT'S SO FUNNY.

09:42.916 --> 09:45.352
ALL RIGHT,
I'M PETER.

09:45.385 --> 09:46.720
SPOT ON.

09:46.754 --> 09:48.021
WE'RE OUT TO DINNER,
DOUBLE DATE,

09:48.055 --> 09:49.022
IT'S GOING GREAT.

09:49.056 --> 09:50.023
ALL OF A SUDDEN,

09:50.057 --> 09:51.024
THE CONVERSATION
STARTS TO GET

09:51.058 --> 09:52.726
A LITTLE IFFY
ABOUT NORTH KOREA.

09:52.760 --> 09:54.662
AND I FEEL HER HAND
UNDER THE TABLE...

09:54.695 --> 09:56.329
OH!
WHOA.

09:56.363 --> 09:57.798
I KNOW.
IT WAS CRAZY.

09:57.831 --> 09:59.900
SHE GRABBED MY JUNK
UNDER THE TABLE.

09:59.933 --> 10:01.669
THAT'S MY PENIS.
YOU CAN'T JUST--

10:01.702 --> 10:02.970
NOT OKAY.
AND THE CINNAMON

10:03.003 --> 10:04.337
AND THE NICKNAMES.

10:04.371 --> 10:06.640
THAT'S MY PENIS.

10:06.674 --> 10:08.709
I'M SORRY.
I'M JUST TELLING A STORY.

10:08.742 --> 10:09.677
MINE.

10:09.710 --> 10:10.911
WE'RE ALL FRIENDS.

10:10.944 --> 10:13.046
YOU KNOW WHAT,
THAT'S--

10:13.080 --> 10:15.649
I WENT OVER THE PANTS!

10:16.449 --> 10:17.751
(Morgan)
RULE NUMBER SIX,

10:17.785 --> 10:19.687
MY SOCKS WILL STAY ON.

10:19.720 --> 10:22.289
FINAL SEX RULE, YOU CAN'T
FALL IN LOVE WITH ME.

10:22.322 --> 10:23.891
OKAY,
I THINK THE ALCOHOL

10:23.924 --> 10:25.425
IS STARTING TO WEAR OFF,

10:25.458 --> 10:26.827
SO WHY DON'T YOU GO
IN THE BEDROOM,

10:26.860 --> 10:27.928
AND I'M GONNA
FRESHEN UP HERE.

10:27.961 --> 10:29.196
I'VE NEVER DONE IT
IN A BEDROOM BEFORE.

10:29.229 --> 10:30.197
OKAY.

10:30.230 --> 10:31.732
ONE TIME I--
OH. YEP.

10:41.208 --> 10:42.843
WHAT AM I DOING?

10:46.880 --> 10:49.216
MORGAN, YOU WERE RIGHT.
THIS IS BAD IDEA.

10:49.249 --> 10:50.450
I DIDN'T--

10:50.483 --> 10:51.719
OH, MY GOD!

10:51.752 --> 10:52.519
HI.

10:52.552 --> 10:54.421
I WAS GONE FOR, LIKE,
TEN SECONDS.

10:54.454 --> 10:56.056
[softly]
IT FELT LIKE FOREVER.

10:56.089 --> 10:57.057
WHAT?

10:57.090 --> 10:58.125
IT FELT LIKE FOREVER.

10:58.158 --> 10:59.192
YOU'RE USING, LIKE,
A BEDROOM VOICE.

10:59.226 --> 11:00.861
I HONESTLY CAN'T
HEAR YOU.

11:00.894 --> 11:02.896
OPEN THOSE BLINDS,
AND LET'S LET THE STARS WATCH.

11:02.930 --> 11:03.897
COME HERE, YOU.

11:03.931 --> 11:04.932
AAH!

11:06.800 --> 11:08.702
PLEASE DON'T ACT
SO SHOCKED AND DISGUSTED.

11:08.736 --> 11:10.170
IT'S A LITTLE OFFENSIVE.

11:10.203 --> 11:11.438
TAKE YOUR STUFF.
THIS IS A BIG MISTAKE.

11:11.471 --> 11:13.073
JUST REMEMBER
THAT IT WAS YOU

11:13.106 --> 11:16.109
THAT ASKED ME MOMENTS AGO
TO HAVE SEX WITH YOU,

11:16.143 --> 11:18.311
SO I'M GONNA GO,
AND I WANT TO THANK YOU

11:18.345 --> 11:20.814
FOR REALLY MAKING THIS
A GREAT NIGHT FOR EVERYONE.

11:22.515 --> 11:24.284
(Danny)
THIS ISN'T WORKING OUT, PETER.

11:24.317 --> 11:25.886
WE'RE LETTING YOU GO,
BUD.

11:25.919 --> 11:27.921
I CAN'T LOSE ANOTHER JOB.

11:27.955 --> 11:28.989
THIS EATS!

11:29.022 --> 11:30.457
(Jeremy)
PETER, PETER.

11:30.490 --> 11:32.092
I'M SO SORRY.

11:32.125 --> 11:33.961
LOOK, I KNOW WHEN I
GRABBED YOUR JUNK BEFORE

11:33.994 --> 11:35.428
THAT THAT WAS WRONG.

11:35.462 --> 11:37.865
AFTERWARDS, I KEPT
THINKING TO MYSELF,

11:37.898 --> 11:40.100
WHAT WOULD IT FEEL LIKE
TO BE IN THIS GUY'S SHOES,

11:40.133 --> 11:43.771
YOU KNOW, AND HAVE SOME SUPER
HANDSOME GUY GRAB MY PENIS?

11:43.804 --> 11:45.005
WELL, I WOULD
HAVE LOVED IT,

11:45.038 --> 11:46.006
BUT THAT'S ME,

11:46.039 --> 11:47.307
AND WE'RE ALL DIFFERENT.

11:47.340 --> 11:49.076
YOU KNOW, THAT'S WHAT
MARTIN LUTHER KING

11:49.109 --> 11:51.144
WAS SAYING.

11:51.178 --> 11:53.013
NO, THAT'S NOT
WHAT HE MEANT.

11:53.046 --> 11:54.081
GOT THAT WRONG.

11:54.114 --> 11:55.415
YOU GUYS HAVE NO IDEA

11:55.448 --> 11:57.150
HOW IMPORTANT
THIS JOB IS TO ME.

11:57.184 --> 12:00.320
I HAVE NEVER WORKED WITH
SUCH SMART AND RAD PEOPLE.

12:00.353 --> 12:02.389
EVERYBODY HERE MAKES ME
WANT TO BE A BETTER DOCTOR.

12:02.422 --> 12:04.091
(Jeremy)
ALL RIGHT, PETER.
YOU CAN STAY.

12:04.124 --> 12:04.892
WAIT, WHAT?

12:04.925 --> 12:06.526
EVERYONE DESERVES
A SECOND CHANCE.

12:06.559 --> 12:07.360
COME ON.

12:07.394 --> 12:09.362
PLUS HIS NAME'S ALREADY
ON THE SIGN.

12:09.396 --> 12:10.497
THIS IS GREAT.

12:10.530 --> 12:12.299
AWESOME.
[laughs]

12:12.332 --> 12:14.467
I WOULD TEACH YOU GUYS
MY SECRET HANDSHAKE,

12:14.501 --> 12:17.504
BUT THEN I'D HAVE TO
TOUCH YOUR JUNK AGAIN.

12:18.972 --> 12:21.374
[phone ringing]

12:21.408 --> 12:22.375
(Mindy)
HELLO?

12:22.409 --> 12:23.376
(Cliff)
DR. LAHIRI.

12:23.410 --> 12:24.912
HI, IT'S CLIFF GILBERT.

12:24.945 --> 12:27.014
OH, THIS IS SAD.

12:27.047 --> 12:28.481
YOU WERE INCREDIBLY
RUDE TO ME YESTERDAY,

12:28.515 --> 12:29.883
BUT WHAT DO YOU KNOW?

12:29.917 --> 12:31.484
CAN'T STOP THINKING
ABOUT ME.

12:31.518 --> 12:34.121
SURE, I'LL GO ON A DATE
WITH YOU...

12:34.154 --> 12:35.856
IN YOUR DREAMS, CLIFF.

12:35.889 --> 12:37.457
ACTUALLY I'D COMPLETELY
FORGOTTEN ABOUT YOU

12:37.490 --> 12:39.459
UNTIL YOUR EMPLOYEE
MORGAN TUKERS

12:39.492 --> 12:41.361
CAME INTO MY OFFICE, AND...

12:41.394 --> 12:43.296
TOOKERS.

12:43.330 --> 12:45.032
MORGAN TOOKERS
CAME INTO MY OFFICE

12:45.065 --> 12:47.267
AND SAID HE WANTED TO SUE
YOU FOR SEXUAL HARASSMENT.

12:47.300 --> 12:51.138
I THOUGHT, "YEP, THAT
SEEMS ABOUT RIGHT."

12:54.041 --> 12:55.275
(Cliff)
OKAY. OKAY.

12:55.308 --> 12:56.877
THE REASON WE'RE ALL HERE

12:56.910 --> 12:58.545
IS BECAUSE LAST NIGHT
MS. LAHIRI TRIED TO COERCE

12:58.578 --> 13:00.814
MY CLIENT INTO
SEXUAL INTERCOURSE.

13:00.848 --> 13:01.815
WHAT?
YOU DID WHAT?

13:01.849 --> 13:02.950
YOU DID THAT?

13:02.983 --> 13:03.951
COME ON!

13:03.984 --> 13:07.287
SO MY CLIENT IS SEEKING
$200,000 IN RESTITUTION.

13:07.320 --> 13:09.089
WHAT?
$200,000?

13:09.122 --> 13:10.858
I SHOULD BE SUING YOU
FOR $2 BILLION

13:10.891 --> 13:13.026
BECAUSE I HAD TO SEE
YOUR ENTIRE BUTT CRACK.

13:13.060 --> 13:14.594
MY BUTT CRACK'S FANTASTIC.

13:14.627 --> 13:17.297
IT'S IMPORTANT
FOR ME TO SPEAK

13:17.330 --> 13:18.832
FOR THOSE
WHO CANNOT SPEAK.

13:18.866 --> 13:19.867
WHAT ARE YOU,
THE LORAX?

13:19.900 --> 13:21.068
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

13:21.101 --> 13:22.435
OKAY, SO HERE'S HOW
THIS IS GONNA WORK.

13:22.469 --> 13:24.471
YOU'RE GONNA PAY
MY CLIENT $200,000,

13:24.504 --> 13:25.839
OR WE WILL SEE YOU IN COURT.

13:25.873 --> 13:27.074
SEE YOU IN JUDGE JUDY,
BABE.

13:27.107 --> 13:28.842
WAIT A MINUTE. WAIT.
WE CAN TALK ABOUT THIS.

13:28.876 --> 13:29.843
THERE IS ONE OTHER WAY.

13:29.877 --> 13:31.011
NO, THERE IS
NO OTHER WAY.

13:31.044 --> 13:32.245
THERE'S ONE OTHER WAY.
NO, THERE ISN'T.

13:32.279 --> 13:34.047
THERE'S ONE
OTHER WAY.

13:34.081 --> 13:35.615
DR. L.,

13:35.648 --> 13:37.350
YOU THREW ME OUT OF
YOUR HOUSE LAST NIGHT

13:37.384 --> 13:39.219
AND YOU SAID YOU NEVER WANTED
TO BE WITH SOMEONE LIKE ME,

13:39.252 --> 13:40.387
AND THAT HURT.

13:40.420 --> 13:42.956
BUT I WILL FORGET
ABOUT THE MONEY

13:42.990 --> 13:45.625
IF YOU TAKE ME
ON A NICE DATE.

13:45.658 --> 13:46.994
WHAT?

13:47.027 --> 13:47.995
SQUEEZE ME?

13:48.028 --> 13:49.562
LIKE, A DINNER DATE.

13:49.596 --> 13:51.064
MINDY WOULD BE HAPPY TO
TAKE MORGAN OUT ON A DATE,

13:51.098 --> 13:53.867
TEEMING WITH RESPECT
AND DECENCY.

13:53.901 --> 13:54.868
IT'S SETTLED.
GOOD.

13:54.902 --> 13:55.702
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

13:55.735 --> 13:57.905
IT'S NOT SETTLED.
I AGREE.
I AGREE.

13:57.938 --> 13:58.872
YEAH, IT'S NOT SETTLED.
IT'S ONE DATE.

13:58.906 --> 14:00.941
YOU'RE GONNA GO OUT.
YOU'RE GONNA LOOK NICE.

14:00.974 --> 14:02.409
DON'T WEAR YOUR FATSTEPS,
PLEASE--NO ONE LIKES THOSE.

14:02.442 --> 14:04.577
PEOPLE LOVE MY FATSTEPS.

14:04.611 --> 14:06.179
THEY DON'T.
(Jeremy)
PEOPLE HATE THEM.

14:06.213 --> 14:07.948
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I THOUGHT I HAD HIT ROCK BOTTOM,

14:07.981 --> 14:09.416
BUT WE MANAGED TO FIND
A NEW SUBBASEMENT.

14:09.449 --> 14:11.151
SO, YEAH, LET'S DO THIS.
LET'S DO THIS.

14:11.184 --> 14:12.585
THIS IS MY LIFE NOW.

14:12.619 --> 14:14.021
OKAY, MR. TOOKERS,

14:14.054 --> 14:15.889
I'M GOING TO BE BILLING
YOU FOR THE HOURS

14:15.923 --> 14:17.224
I'VE WASTED ON THIS.

14:17.257 --> 14:21.028
I HAVE NO MONEY,
AND I WILL NOT PAY.

14:21.061 --> 14:22.595
IF YOU LET ME HAVE
HEARTACHE DAYS,

14:22.629 --> 14:24.998
WE WOULDN'T BE IN
THIS SITUATION.

14:25.032 --> 14:26.399
(Danny)
WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THERE?

14:26.433 --> 14:29.636
YOU GOT YOUR DATE OUTFIT--

14:29.669 --> 14:31.004
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

14:31.038 --> 14:32.973
COME ON.
LET'S GO. MOVE.

14:33.006 --> 14:34.474
I'M SORRY I FOUND
IT CHALLENGING

14:34.507 --> 14:37.644
TO ACCESSORIZE
FOR A DATE TO HELL.

14:37.677 --> 14:39.512
COME ON, YOU DATE CREEPS
ALL THE TIME.

14:39.546 --> 14:40.513
IT'S NOT A BIG DEAL.

14:40.547 --> 14:41.514
HEY, THESE ARE HOT.

14:41.548 --> 14:42.582
YOU SHOULD WEAR THESE.

14:42.615 --> 14:44.117
A PINK G-STRING?

14:44.151 --> 14:45.118
YEAH, ON THE BOTTOM.

14:45.152 --> 14:46.286
I MEAN, THIS IS HOT.

14:46.319 --> 14:47.988
IF I SAW YOU IN IT--

14:48.021 --> 14:49.422
ON SIGHT!

14:49.456 --> 14:50.223
WHAT?

14:50.257 --> 14:52.425
I WOULD CHOP YOU DOWN
ON SIGHT.

14:52.459 --> 14:53.426
(Danny)
WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?
WHOA!

14:53.460 --> 14:55.963
WHAT? WHY DID IT GET WEIRD
WHEN I SAID THAT?

14:55.996 --> 14:56.829
I'M NOT GOING TO WEAR
A PINK G-STRING

14:56.863 --> 14:58.698
ON MY COERCED DATE
WITH MY COWORKER.

14:58.731 --> 14:59.532
SO...

14:59.566 --> 15:01.969
JUST PICK OUT SOMETHING,
ANYTHING NICE.

15:02.002 --> 15:03.470

LOOK AT THIS.

15:03.503 --> 15:05.638
THIS IS PERFECT, RIGHT?
THAT'S NICE.

15:05.672 --> 15:07.607
WHAT?

15:07.640 --> 15:08.608

15:08.641 --> 15:10.510
THAT'S CASEY'S SHIRT.

15:10.543 --> 15:12.645
OH, GOD, YOU GUYS.

15:12.679 --> 15:14.214
HE'S GONNA HAUNT ME
FOREVER.

15:14.247 --> 15:16.316
I'M NEVER GONNA FIND
ANYONE LIKE THAT AGAIN.

15:16.349 --> 15:17.317
OKAY.
OH, HEY.

15:17.350 --> 15:19.552

15:23.156 --> 15:24.958
AM I EVER GONNA
MEET ANYBODY?

15:24.992 --> 15:26.559
MAYBE.
I DON'T KNOW THE FUTURE.

15:26.593 --> 15:28.195
DEPENDS.

15:28.228 --> 15:29.629
THANK YOU.

15:29.662 --> 15:31.498
AND IF YOU DON'T WANT
TO GO ON THAT DATE,

15:31.531 --> 15:32.632
YOU DON'T HAVE TO.

15:32.665 --> 15:33.866
WE'LL JUST PAY MORGAN
THE $200,000.

15:33.900 --> 15:36.003
WE'RE NOT DOING THAT.
THAT IS ABSOLUTELY
NOT GONNA HAPPEN.

15:36.036 --> 15:37.104
THAT'S A GREAT IDEA!

15:37.137 --> 15:38.571
NO, NO, NO.
NO WAY. NO.

15:38.605 --> 15:39.506
GREAT, I'LL JUST BE
YOUR SEX SLAVE

15:39.539 --> 15:42.009
TO WHOEVER YOU WANT
TO WHORE ME OUT TO.

15:42.042 --> 15:42.909
THAT'S NOT WHAT
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT.

15:42.942 --> 15:44.344
I'LL JUST DO WHATEVER
YOU WANT TO DO.

15:44.377 --> 15:45.645
LISTEN TO ME!

15:45.678 --> 15:48.348
I'M SORRY
ABOUT YOU AND CASEY.

WE ALL ARE.

15:49.782 --> 15:51.718
YEAH, LOOK, IT SUCKS.
I'M SORRY.

15:51.751 --> 15:53.286
SO WHY DON'T YOU
JUST PICK

15:53.320 --> 15:54.387
ANY ONE OF THESE
GORGEOUS FROCKS

15:54.421 --> 15:57.724
AND GO OUT AND SHOW THIS

15:57.757 --> 15:59.692
LOOK, YOU NEED THIS,

15:59.726 --> 16:02.629

PRIVACY IS BEST.

16:13.473 --> 16:14.674
YOU'RE GONNA BE OKAY.

16:19.279 --> 16:20.613
TAKE THIS WITH ME.

16:27.520 --> 16:29.722
(Morgan)
WHOA!

16:32.092 --> 16:33.226

FIRE.

16:33.260 --> 16:34.394
NOTHING'S HAPPENING.

16:34.427 --> 16:36.463
OOH.
ALL RIGHT.

16:36.496 --> 16:38.198
CONVERSATION.
CONVERSATION.

16:38.231 --> 16:40.033
OH.

16:40.067 --> 16:42.735
HOW MUCH MONEY
DO YOU MAKE ANNUALLY?

16:42.769 --> 16:44.537

16:53.846 --> 16:55.648
YOU KNOW, BECAUSE IT'S
SUPPOSED TO BE A FUN DATE

16:55.682 --> 16:57.317
THAT WE'RE ON TOGETHER.

16:57.350 --> 16:58.451
OF COURSE, NO, NO, NO.
SO WE SHOULD HAVE FUN.

16:58.485 --> 16:59.452
YOU'RE RIGHT.
YOU'RE RIGHT.

16:59.486 --> 17:00.453
ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.

17:00.487 --> 17:01.454
THAT WAS SO RUDE.

17:01.488 --> 17:03.256
HAVE YOU EVER
TRAVELED ABROAD?

17:03.290 --> 17:05.458
YES, ONE TIME
I WENT TO MONTREAL.

17:05.492 --> 17:06.726
BEAUTIFUL CITY.

17:06.759 --> 17:08.361
YEAH, I WENT THERE
TO SEE A PROSTITUTE

17:08.395 --> 17:10.730
THAT I HAD BEEN
TALKING TO ONLINE.

17:10.763 --> 17:12.465
AND I GOT THERE...

17:12.499 --> 17:13.800
TURNED OUT
SHE WAS A MAN,

17:13.833 --> 17:17.670
AND HE BEAT THE HELL
OUT OF ME PRETTY BAD, SO...

17:17.704 --> 17:20.340
THAT'S THE LAST TIME
I TRAVELED ANYWHERE.

17:24.711 --> 17:25.678
HEY, YOU'RE GETTING SAUCE

17:25.712 --> 17:27.714
ALL OVER THE
ROAD AND TRACK, MAN.

17:27.747 --> 17:29.282
THAT'S COMMUNAL.

17:29.316 --> 17:30.317
HEY, DUDE,

17:30.350 --> 17:31.518
HOW MANY TIMES ARE YOU GONNA

17:31.551 --> 17:33.286

17:33.320 --> 17:36.223
UH, TUB BIRTH.
I'M GONNA VOMIT.

17:36.256 --> 17:37.290
WE'LL JUST GO THROUGH IT.
COME ON.

17:37.324 --> 17:38.758
YOU KNOW, YOU GUYS,

17:38.791 --> 17:39.826
I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING
TO DO TONIGHT,

17:39.859 --> 17:41.561
SO IF YOU NEED
AN EXTRA SET OF HANDS,

17:41.594 --> 17:42.829
I COULD HELP YOU OUT.

17:42.862 --> 17:45.265
WAIT A MINUTE.

17:48.201 --> 17:49.802
I HAVE TO DO ALL
THE STUFF THAT YOU GUYS

17:49.836 --> 17:50.803
DON'T WANT TO DO.

17:50.837 --> 17:52.105
I'M YOUR BITCH.

17:52.139 --> 17:53.473
THAT'S VERY HELPFUL, PETER.

17:53.506 --> 17:56.509
YEAH, THAT'S VERY, VERY,
VERY HELPFUL, PETER.

17:56.543 --> 17:57.777
GREAT.

17:57.810 --> 18:00.447
AND IF I MAY QUOTE
MOST OF MY T-SHIRTS,

18:00.480 --> 18:03.082
LET'S GET WET, LADIES.

18:04.851 --> 18:06.353

18:34.347 --> 18:35.315
(Mindy)
MORGAN, DID YOU BRING ME HERE

18:35.348 --> 18:36.783

18:37.917 --> 18:39.852
I WANT TO SHOW YOU

18:39.886 --> 18:42.822
THE QUARRY.

18:42.855 --> 18:43.823

18:43.856 --> 18:44.824
THIS IS A REAL PLACE.

18:44.857 --> 18:45.825
YES.

18:45.858 --> 18:46.926
[train whistle blaring]

18:46.959 --> 18:48.328
TRAIN.

18:48.361 --> 18:49.829

IT'S NICE!
YEAH, I KNOW.

18:54.534 --> 18:55.568
WATCH THIS.

18:55.602 --> 18:58.438
IF YOU YELL,

18:58.471 --> 19:00.573
[echoing]
IT ECHOES.

19:00.607 --> 19:02.342
PRETTY COOL.

19:02.375 --> 19:04.177
SOMETIMES I COME HERE,

19:11.251 --> 19:13.686
THEY HELP!
[echoing]
THEY HELP...

19:13.720 --> 19:15.722
NO ONE CAN YOU HEAR
YOU BUT THE ROCKS.

19:15.755 --> 19:16.623
THEY WERE HERE BEFORE
WE WERE BORN,

19:16.656 --> 19:19.526
AND THEY'LL BE HERE
AFTER WE'RE GONE.

19:19.559 --> 19:20.827
CAN I TRY?

19:20.860 --> 19:23.896
THAT'S WHY I BROUGHT
YOU UP HERE, DUMBASS.

19:23.930 --> 19:24.897

19:34.741 --> 19:36.776
[echoing]
I HATE THIS FEELING!

19:38.645 --> 19:40.347

19:42.882 --> 19:44.251
UH-HUH.

19:44.284 --> 19:48.655
DR. L., I'VE BEEN DUMPED
36 TIMES IN MY LIFE.

19:48.688 --> 19:49.922
GOD.

19:49.956 --> 19:51.824
I WAS LEFT AT
THE ALTAR THREE TIMES.

19:51.858 --> 19:54.661
TWO DIFFERENT WOMEN
FAKED THEIR OWN DEATHS

19:54.694 --> 19:56.996
TO GET AWAY FROM ME.

19:57.029 --> 19:58.665
THE POINT IS,
YOU CAN'T FORCE YOURSELF

19:58.698 --> 20:00.433
TO GET OVER SOMEONE.

20:00.467 --> 20:02.902
BUT IT'LL HAPPEN.

20:02.935 --> 20:05.372
YOU KNOW,
MAYBE TOMORROW.

20:05.405 --> 20:06.973
MAYBE IN FIVE YEARS.

20:07.006 --> 20:09.376
OH, GOD.
THROW ME IN THE QUARRY.

THAT WANT TO EAT US.

20:13.613 --> 20:15.382

THIS IS ACTUALLY
A PRETTY NICE DATE.

20:51.784 --> 20:54.787
DID YOU BRING PROTECTION?

20:54.821 --> 20:56.289
DO YOU USE PROTECTION?

20:56.323 --> 20:58.291
OH, MY GOD.
NO, NO, NO, NO.

20:59.626 --> 21:02.362
WHY DON'T YOU USE A BACKPACK
INSTEAD OF A PLASTIC BAG?

21:02.395 --> 21:03.363
MY BIRTHDAY'S COMING UP.

21:03.396 --> 21:05.665
HOLD THE DOOR.
HOLD THE DOOR.

21:05.698 --> 21:06.966
OH, IT'S YOU.

I'M A RAY OF SUNSHINE.

21:14.006 --> 21:15.074
YEAH, WELL,
YOU DEFINITELY LOOK

21:15.107 --> 21:17.344
BETTER THAN YOU
DID YESTERDAY.

21:17.377 --> 21:19.412
THANK YOU.
I BATHED.

21:19.446 --> 21:22.349
THAT'S IMPORTANT.

21:22.382 --> 21:23.950
