Wake up, Sarah, you're late.

03:52.040 --> 03:54.709
- Can you drop me off?
- No.

03:54.751 --> 03:56.711
It's too late

Hey, Richard.

Hey.

Oh.

04:22.863 --> 04:24.948
- Yeah.
- Congrats.

04:26.283 --> 04:29.119
Oh, hey, did you give
it some thought,

04:29.161 --> 04:32.789
getting food from a food bank,
or maybe even food stamps?

04:32.831 --> 04:34.916
It would really help
you and Sarah out.

04:34.958 --> 04:36.460
We're fine.

04:39.629 --> 04:44.634
Richard, I hope you don't mind,
I took Sarah to school.

04:46.053 --> 04:47.679
- You did?
- Yeah.

04:47.721 --> 04:49.390
I couldn't say no to her.

What's good? Come on in.

05:50.825 --> 05:52.702
[Richard sighs]

05:52.744 --> 05:54.580
Make yourself comfortable.

05:56.457 --> 05:57.874
You want somethin' to drink?

05:58.667 --> 06:00.419
Nah.

06:00.461 --> 06:03.213
I just came to chill for a
minute before I go back to work.

06:03.255 --> 06:04.839

You know...

06:14.182 --> 06:16.644

Nah.

Are you freakin' kidding me?

07:11.615 --> 07:13.950
- Take the bus.
- I can't.

07:13.992 --> 07:16.203
A dance audition came up,
I can't miss it.

07:16.244 --> 07:17.663

I gotta pick someone up,
and I can't be late.

07:19.831 --> 07:22.000
Please?

07:22.042 --> 07:23.502
It won't take long, I promise.

07:23.544 --> 07:26.505
- Be ready when I get there.
- Thank you.

07:35.055 --> 07:36.390
Thank you.

07:37.432 --> 07:38.975
[Richard] You owe me.

07:46.692 --> 07:48.193
Bye.

08:00.706 --> 08:02.207
Where's the driver?

08:05.835 --> 08:07.170

Hey, Angie.

Sorry,
I'm stuck in traffic.

<i>Richard, you should've
been there already.</i>

08:29.984 --> 08:32.654
I'll be there soon,
I promise.

[sighs]

09:55.987 --> 09:57.865
You wanna hang out
for a little while?

09:57.906 --> 09:59.073
I can get some girls over.

09:59.115 --> 10:01.117
Nah, I gotta make more runs.

10:01.159 --> 10:03.745
You are workin' entirely
too hard, my friend.

10:03.787 --> 10:05.706
An empire wasn't
built in a day.

10:07.957 --> 10:09.626
True.

10:09.668 --> 10:11.670
You should consider getting
into the pimpin' business.

10:11.712 --> 10:16.174
Plenty of money to be made,
less battles to be fought.

10:17.258 --> 10:18.259
You can build your empire

10:18.301 --> 10:19.511
faster than you can imagine.

10:19.553 --> 10:20.804
I hear you.

10:20.846 --> 10:22.806
I just don't like
dealing with the girls.

10:22.848 --> 10:24.098
Becomes a hassle.

10:24.140 --> 10:25.308
It's way less of a hassle

10:25.350 --> 10:27.060
than being shot at
by your competition.

10:28.019 --> 10:29.270
Look,

10:29.312 --> 10:33.650
all you gotta do
is get the girls.

10:34.609 --> 10:36.277
Pick up, drop off.

10:36.695 --> 10:38.112
Nothin' to it.

10:39.656 --> 10:43.952
You'll make a little less
than me, but, you know.

10:43.993 --> 10:46.371
- [chuckle]
- [door clicks]

10:50.083 --> 10:51.626
I pulled your file.

10:53.086 --> 10:55.630
Seems this ain't
your first rodeo.

10:57.006 --> 10:58.967
Am I being charged
with something?

10:59.008 --> 11:03.513
Theft, possession
of narcotics, assault.

11:03.555 --> 11:06.683
You got quite the history here.
You tell me.

11:06.725 --> 11:09.603
If I'm not being charged,
I'd like you to let me go.

11:10.812 --> 11:12.313
Or at least give me
my phone call,

11:12.355 --> 11:13.732
so I can call my lawyer.

11:13.774 --> 11:15.567
OK.

11:17.861 --> 11:19.404
You're free to go.

11:22.950 --> 11:24.367
We're not done here.

11:27.328 --> 11:28.830
[door clicks]

11:29.623 --> 11:30.665
How is it my fault?

11:30.707 --> 11:31.750
Really, Sarah?

11:31.792 --> 11:34.502
If, and by if, I mean when,

11:34.544 --> 11:38.214
the cops decide to put this
on me, I will go to jail.

11:40.550 --> 11:41.969
Who will take care of you then?

11:42.010 --> 11:44.679
- I can take care of myself.
- Yeah.

11:45.221 --> 11:46.514
Sure you can.

12:00.862 --> 12:03.156
How can she not see
where I'm coming from?

12:04.407 --> 12:05.742
Oh, and get this,

12:05.784 --> 12:07.702
she can take care of herself.

12:07.744 --> 12:09.162
[Caden] <i>She's a kid.</i>

12:10.831 --> 12:12.165
Yeah, I know.

12:13.249 --> 12:15.669
That's why I've got
to clear my name.

12:15.710 --> 12:18.254
<i>Work with the police,
they'll help you.</i>

12:19.047 --> 12:21.008
Hell no.

12:21.049 --> 12:23.134
I've got to find
the girl myself,

12:23.885 --> 12:25.428
then she can clear my name.

12:25.470 --> 12:29.307
<i>Crazy talk.
Hey, I'm here, open the door.</i>

12:33.603 --> 12:35.146
[lock clicks]

12:37.231 --> 12:38.316
I've got the drinks.

12:38.358 --> 12:39.901
And I've got the pizza.

12:43.196 --> 12:45.615
So what's
it gonna be tonight?

12:45.657 --> 12:49.661
I was thinking we can watch
season five, <i>Supernatural.</i>

12:49.703 --> 12:51.038
Sounds good.

12:58.879 --> 13:01.422
You're not really
considering this nonsense.

13:01.464 --> 13:03.842
Yeah, I am.
It's no worry, though.

13:03.884 --> 13:06.053
I'll talk to some people,
they'll get me where I need to go,

13:06.094 --> 13:08.262
- and I'll find the girl.
- Yeah, see I don't buy that.

13:08.304 --> 13:10.849
I'm still in contact with
some people from my past.

13:10.891 --> 13:14.268
Yeah, past,
as in just leave it be.

13:17.188 --> 13:19.774
Are we watching
<i>Supernatural</i> or not?

13:22.777 --> 13:24.404

- [indistinct chatter]
- Get off of him!

13:44.841 --> 13:46.801
[officer]
You're under arrest

13:46.843 --> 13:48.136
- for the kidnapping...
- Richard!

[officer] and lying to Swift.

13:50.972 --> 13:53.266
- [Caden] You're hurting him!
- Anything you say

13:53.307 --> 13:55.685
can and will be used against
you in a court of law.

13:55.727 --> 13:57.812
You have the right
to an attorney.

13:57.854 --> 14:01.566
If you cannot afford one,
one will be appointed to you.

14:01.608 --> 14:02.483
Come on.

14:02.525 --> 14:03.860
- Wake up, Sarah.
- Come on!

14:03.902 --> 14:05.278
- Hey...
- Tell her to call my lawyer!

14:05.319 --> 14:06.571
Come on!

14:08.073 --> 14:09.323
Why won't you believe me?

14:09.365 --> 14:11.409
Because you have
a bad history, Richard.

14:12.577 --> 14:14.788
If you're so sure,

14:14.829 --> 14:18.959
- then why am I not behind bars?
- Oh you will be, you will.

14:19.000 --> 14:21.628
As soon as you tell us
where the little girl's at.

14:24.172 --> 14:25.632
What about the piano teacher?

14:25.673 --> 14:27.134
Violin teacher.

14:27.884 --> 14:29.218
And he's cleared.

14:31.054 --> 14:33.056
- You're the only suspect.
- Bullshit.

14:33.098 --> 14:35.308
I would never do
something like that.

14:35.349 --> 14:39.604
Yeah? Well, your military
background suggests otherwise.

14:48.696 --> 14:50.406
[gunfire]

14:50.448 --> 14:52.283
Are you sure this is
the extraction point?

14:52.325 --> 14:53.910
Yeah, double checked!

14:54.911 --> 14:56.579
Well, where the hell are they?

14:57.455 --> 14:59.916
[gunfire]

14:59.958 --> 15:02.376
- [thud]
- [groans]

15:06.339 --> 15:09.134
- Stay awake.
- Stop, stop, stop!

15:09.509 --> 15:10.802
Down.

15:10.844 --> 15:14.305
[distant gunfire]

15:20.520 --> 15:23.314
Isn't suicide
against your faith?

15:23.356 --> 15:25.483
[distant gunfire]

15:28.862 --> 15:30.238
I'll do it.

15:30.279 --> 15:31.739
Good man.

Detective Moro?

16:53.321 --> 16:55.198
Yeah?

16:55.240 --> 16:57.784
My name is David Peele,
and as of this moment,

16:57.825 --> 16:59.911
I'll be representing
Mr. Evans.

17:01.370 --> 17:03.039
You all right?

17:03.081 --> 17:05.540
Now Detective,
I'm sure you'll find everything

17:05.583 --> 17:08.669
in accordance with my firm's
representation of Mr. Evans.

17:08.711 --> 17:11.256
And he's to be
released immediately.

17:14.884 --> 17:17.929
Now please, remove his cuffs.

17:23.476 --> 17:25.519
I'm going to Caden's house.

17:25.560 --> 17:27.105
She made us some food.

17:27.146 --> 17:28.982
Do you want me to
bring you some?

17:29.023 --> 17:30.483
I'm fine.

17:30.524 --> 17:31.901
I'll bring you some anyway.

17:33.945 --> 17:35.738
[door opens, shuts]

18:05.852 --> 18:09.397
got some clothes
for you afterwards.

18:09.438 --> 18:12.525
- You go first.
- OK.

18:12.566 --> 18:15.028
I really appreciate
what you're doing.

18:16.737 --> 18:19.199
But why?

18:19.240 --> 18:23.203
When you see a brother in need
you just gotta help out.

18:30.877 --> 18:32.128
Good morning.

18:36.299 --> 18:38.009
You goin' out again tonight?

18:38.551 --> 18:40.136
Money don't sleep.

18:40.178 --> 18:42.263
I got somethin' for you.

18:46.809 --> 18:48.895
- Take it.
- What's up?

18:48.936 --> 18:50.313
I can't.

18:51.856 --> 18:53.900
You need to start pullin' your
weight around here.

18:53.941 --> 18:57.904
- Then we'll be leaving.
- You'd rather be homeless than accept my help?

18:57.945 --> 19:01.032
This... isn't help.

19:01.074 --> 19:02.783
Let me ask you somethin'.

19:02.825 --> 19:05.328
What'd this country
do for you, huh?

19:05.370 --> 19:07.621
Four years of service
and all you get

19:07.663 --> 19:11.084
is a shiny medal and
a cold dumpster to sleep under.

19:11.125 --> 19:13.461
We gotta start lookin'
out for ourselves.

19:15.046 --> 19:17.048
You gotta look
after your sister.

19:23.054 --> 19:26.266
- [door opens]
- Not workin' today?

19:28.017 --> 19:29.602
Nah.

19:29.643 --> 19:30.895
I lost the job.

19:30.937 --> 19:33.064
Damn, word?

19:33.106 --> 19:35.316
- You got fired?
- [phone buzzes]

19:38.361 --> 19:41.406
- What the hell is this?
- Opportunity.

19:41.448 --> 19:43.950
I been lookin' on ways
to supplement income,

19:43.991 --> 19:45.452
expand our organization.

19:45.493 --> 19:47.745
I think I found it.

19:47.787 --> 19:50.164
Come here man,
let me show you somethin'.

19:51.374 --> 19:53.167
Look, I came here today

19:53.209 --> 19:55.669
'cause I need your help
finding someone.

19:55.711 --> 19:57.004
Word?

19:57.046 --> 19:58.923
All right,
let me show you this,

19:58.965 --> 20:01.509
and we'll talk
about it afterwards.

20:01.550 --> 20:03.094
[Majeed clears throat]

20:09.309 --> 20:10.935
What the hell
are we lookin' at?

20:10.977 --> 20:13.146
Homie of mine, uh,

20:13.187 --> 20:15.189
got me into
this deep web stuff.

20:16.316 --> 20:17.984
Sellin' girls all
around the world.

20:19.860 --> 20:21.695
They're lookin' for suppliers.

20:24.615 --> 20:26.784
- What's your problem, man?
- Have you lost your mind?

20:26.826 --> 20:29.537
- Have you lost your mind?
- Kidnapping kids?

20:35.502 --> 20:36.836
[door shuts]

20:46.429 --> 20:47.805
<i>Thank you, ladies and gents.</i>

20:47.847 --> 20:49.849
<i>That last auction
was an exciting one,</i>

20:49.890 --> 20:53.561
<i>so let's make
this one even better.</i>

21:01.569 --> 21:06.824
Now, a closer look
at our new merchandise.

21:07.908 --> 21:12.705
Lovely.
She is beautiful, isn't she?

21:15.749 --> 21:17.001
Don't be shy...

21:17.877 --> 21:19.253
look.

21:21.672 --> 21:23.216
Look!

21:34.810 --> 21:37.355
You've seen what you're buying,
so let's get started.

21:37.397 --> 21:40.024
The auction starts
in three days.

21:40.983 --> 21:42.651
Happy bidding.

21:43.444 --> 21:45.821
Girls should be here soon.

21:47.073 --> 21:50.243
Good. Good, good, good.

21:52.828 --> 21:54.247
So what'd your boy say?

21:55.540 --> 21:56.541
[man sniffs]

21:56.583 --> 22:00.002
He, um...
sucker punched me.

22:00.044 --> 22:01.462
[laughs]

22:03.506 --> 22:06.759
That's some funny shit.

22:08.261 --> 22:12.098
So, so, so, so, you try
and do right by him...

22:12.139 --> 22:14.225
and he spits in your face, OK.

22:15.184 --> 22:17.061
[chuckles]

22:17.103 --> 22:20.856
You gonna let him get
away with that? [sniffs]

22:21.649 --> 22:24.402
He did that to me?

22:24.444 --> 22:26.695
I would make sure
that he regrets it.

22:28.197 --> 22:29.449
You hear me?

22:31.451 --> 22:33.620
[man] <i>Happy bidding.</i>

22:35.329 --> 22:37.873
This is what they're trying
to say I'm involved in.

22:38.374 --> 22:40.084
OK.

22:40.126 --> 22:42.044
Couldn't you just show
that to the detective?

22:42.086 --> 22:43.796
I mean, that proves
that you didn't do it.

22:43.837 --> 22:47.716
No, because according to them,
I snatched the girl.

22:47.758 --> 22:50.386
So it doesn't matter
if I'm not in the video.

22:50.428 --> 22:52.346
Damn.

22:54.807 --> 22:56.643
Keep an eye on Sarah for me.

22:57.560 --> 22:59.228
I'll be back in an hour.

23:04.233 --> 23:06.068
- [Richard] What's up, man?
- What's up?

23:06.110 --> 23:08.488
- You got the money?
- Yeah.

23:13.701 --> 23:15.995
- Cool.
- Thanks, man.

23:16.036 --> 23:18.914
Hey, who do you get
your drugs from?

23:18.956 --> 23:21.292
- What, you a cop or somethin', man?
- [gun cocks]

23:21.875 --> 23:22.835
No, man.

23:22.876 --> 23:24.295
Let me see your wallet.

23:24.671 --> 23:26.506
All right.

23:26.547 --> 23:29.091
- Put it on the ground.
- All right.

23:29.133 --> 23:31.302
[Richard groans]

23:39.686 --> 23:41.646
[Richard coughing]

23:43.022 --> 23:44.440
Richard Evans.

23:45.441 --> 23:47.151
You're gonna get
yourself killed, man.

23:49.111 --> 23:51.113
[coughing]

23:57.036 --> 23:58.078
[panting]

23:58.120 --> 24:00.998
Richard!
What's-what's wrong?

24:02.166 --> 24:04.835
- Oh, God.
- Don't.

24:04.877 --> 24:06.504
Screw that, I'm calling.

24:08.255 --> 24:12.426
I'll be in trouble
if you call the cops.

24:12.468 --> 24:15.763
[voice fading] But you're hurt,
I have to so something!

24:18.015 --> 24:19.433
[groaning]

24:26.357 --> 24:27.983
Take it easy.

24:28.025 --> 24:31.070
You have two fractured ribs.

24:33.614 --> 24:35.074
Did you...

24:36.242 --> 24:37.993
Called my friend.

24:39.704 --> 24:42.873
- He's a nurse.
- Thanks.

24:43.165 --> 24:44.500
Mm-hm.

24:47.754 --> 24:49.088
[groans]

24:57.430 --> 25:00.140
Take it easy.

25:01.809 --> 25:03.977
[phone ringing]

25:08.733 --> 25:10.984
- Hey, Doc.
- [man] <i>Richard.</i>

25:11.026 --> 25:12.027
Long time.

25:12.069 --> 25:13.404
<i>It's good to hear from you.</i>

25:13.446 --> 25:14.822
<i>How's your family?</i>

25:14.863 --> 25:16.783
We're good.

25:16.824 --> 25:18.492
It's just Sarah and I now.

25:18.534 --> 25:20.035
Our parents passed
a while back.

25:20.077 --> 25:22.622
<i>Oh, sorry to hear.</i>

25:22.663 --> 25:24.081
<i>How can I help you, son?</i>

25:24.123 --> 25:26.250
Would it be...

25:26.292 --> 25:28.628
possible for me
to get some project F?

25:28.669 --> 25:30.588
<i>Ah, you know I can't do that.</i>

25:30.630 --> 25:33.758
<i>Unless, of course,
you're planning on returning to service.</i>

25:33.800 --> 25:36.385
Someone I care
about is in trouble,

25:37.386 --> 25:40.807
and I have to do
something to help them.

25:42.182 --> 25:44.893
All right,
I'll see what I can do.

25:46.562 --> 25:50.566
Man, I could go for like
three cheeseburgers right now.

25:50.608 --> 25:53.402
Yeah?
You don't want no fufu?

25:53.444 --> 25:54.528
[laughs] That, too.

25:54.570 --> 25:55.655
No, no, no, no, man.

25:55.696 --> 25:57.323
Fufu is an African dish, man.

25:57.364 --> 25:58.365
What's in it?

25:58.407 --> 26:00.117
Uh, it's grated cassava

26:00.159 --> 26:02.620
inside a goat meat soup, Mm.

26:02.662 --> 26:05.498
- I tell you what.
- What's that?

26:05.539 --> 26:07.249
When we get outta here,

26:07.291 --> 26:09.251
I'll have my first fufu
with you.

26:09.293 --> 26:11.920
- [man] No doubt.
- [laughs]

26:15.633 --> 26:18.260
- [Richard gasps]
- You OK?

26:18.302 --> 26:21.096
[wheezing]

26:21.138 --> 26:23.432
Yo, what's up here,
what's up here?

26:27.520 --> 26:30.105
Breathe big,
open your mouth, uh-huh.

26:30.147 --> 26:32.483
Look at me, look at me,
come on, come on.

26:33.734 --> 26:36.612
Come on, you're OK,
you're OK, you're OK.

26:47.456 --> 26:50.125
Red'll get you going,
green'll bring you down,

26:50.167 --> 26:51.919
and blue will stabilize.

26:54.755 --> 26:56.089
Thank you, Doc.

26:57.591 --> 26:58.885
Good luck, son.

27:11.814 --> 27:13.106
[sighs]

27:28.748 --> 27:30.290
[chain rattling]

28:01.822 --> 28:03.490
[sighs]

28:11.373 --> 28:12.833
[door beeps]

28:15.294 --> 28:16.670
Brotha, how can I help you?

28:16.712 --> 28:18.380
Hey, you know what's up,
act funny, you're dead.

28:18.422 --> 28:19.298
Everything in the bag now.

28:19.339 --> 28:21.300
[register beeping]

28:21.341 --> 28:22.551
Let's go, everything
in the bag now!

28:22.593 --> 28:24.470
- All right, man.
- Let's go, let's go!

28:24.511 --> 28:25.763
Let's go!

28:30.559 --> 28:31.560
[thief groaning]

28:31.602 --> 28:33.312
Call the cops!

28:33.353 --> 28:34.730
I'mma kill you!

28:34.772 --> 28:36.189
Javier Diaz,

28:36.231 --> 28:38.108
you're gonna
get yourself killed, man.

28:38.150 --> 28:39.735
You never answered my question.

28:39.777 --> 28:40.736
Who do you get your drugs from?

28:40.778 --> 28:42.488
- Screw you!
- Tell me!

28:42.529 --> 28:45.073
His name's Carlos!
Carlos Ricardo,

28:45.115 --> 28:47.451
I was supposed to meet him
at this spot tonight.

28:47.493 --> 28:48.535
35th and McDowell.

28:48.577 --> 28:50.120
[Richard]
Thanks for the info.

28:50.162 --> 28:51.622
You know, you broke my ribs.

28:51.664 --> 28:54.082
Consider us even.

28:54.124 --> 28:56.585
- [bones crunch]
- [Javier screams]

29:04.551 --> 29:06.428
[whimpers]

29:07.220 --> 29:08.931
[bag crinkles]

29:39.670 --> 29:41.338
Let's try this again.

29:42.589 --> 29:46.802
If you disobey me,
you will go without food.

29:48.345 --> 29:49.805
Get up.

29:55.769 --> 29:57.104
Get on your knees.

30:00.607 --> 30:03.318
- [Lyla whimpers]
- Good.

30:04.111 --> 30:05.362
Now come closer.

30:11.827 --> 30:13.620
[smack thuds]

30:16.289 --> 30:17.583
Get up!

30:20.711 --> 30:21.962
Now beg.

30:23.296 --> 30:24.965
Beg for your food.

30:25.549 --> 30:27.134
Please.

30:41.065 --> 30:42.482
[light clicks]

30:43.442 --> 30:47.113
Get off me!
Stop it, stop!

30:47.154 --> 30:51.575
Stop, stop, let go!
[screams]

31:02.128 --> 31:03.378
Richard?

31:07.382 --> 31:08.467
Detective.

31:08.508 --> 31:10.177
We headin'
somewhere dangerous?

31:27.153 --> 31:28.403
What do you want, Detective?

31:28.445 --> 31:30.238
Where you headed
with the vest, Richard?

31:30.280 --> 31:32.699
To a pawn shop to sell it.

31:32.741 --> 31:35.452
You know you're not
off the hook, right?

31:37.704 --> 31:40.332
Why are you so hellbent
on making me the bad guy?

31:40.373 --> 31:43.293
Because you are.
Six months ago, I let a man off the hook,

31:43.335 --> 31:44.962
he slaughtered
his whole family.

31:45.004 --> 31:46.254
I'm not a killer.

31:47.255 --> 31:48.966
You know, we found
a video of the girl.

31:49.008 --> 31:51.718
Now, I know it's not you
in that video,

31:53.470 --> 31:55.097
but I know you're involved.

31:55.139 --> 31:59.059
You found a video of a girl
being abused and molested

31:59.101 --> 32:01.228
by a man who's clearly not me,

32:02.270 --> 32:03.981
and you still believe
that I'm involved.

32:04.023 --> 32:07.985
I never said anything
about her being abused.

32:08.027 --> 32:12.698
- What?
- I did not say a thing about the girl's condition.

32:12.739 --> 32:15.242
Now, either you were there,

32:15.283 --> 32:17.786
or you saw
the same video I did.

32:17.828 --> 32:20.122
Now, you know where she is,

32:20.164 --> 32:22.624
and you're planning on
taking them on yourself?

32:22.666 --> 32:24.084
I don't know anything.

32:24.835 --> 32:26.086
Look, I will arrest you

32:26.128 --> 32:27.713
for withholding
crucial information.

32:27.754 --> 32:28.964
One moment I'm a criminal,

32:29.006 --> 32:31.466
the next I'm
withholding information?

32:32.384 --> 32:34.094
Make up your mind, Detective.

32:34.136 --> 32:35.179
If you wanna find the girl,

32:35.221 --> 32:38.515
I suggest
you do your damn job.

32:39.850 --> 32:41.685
[man on TV]
<i>Yeah, yeah, help yourself.</i>

32:41.727 --> 32:44.063
[girl on TV] <i>I think that's
an excellent idea.</i>

32:44.104 --> 32:45.689
- <i>She's smart...</i>
- [TV clicks]

32:45.731 --> 32:48.025
- You don't have to turn it off.
- Nah, it's cool.

32:48.067 --> 32:49.235
We don't want you interrupting

32:49.276 --> 32:52.404
- our girlie show.
- I'm headed out.

32:52.445 --> 32:55.866
So you guys do whatever it
is you planned on doing.

32:57.117 --> 32:58.202
And be safe.

32:58.244 --> 32:59.452
You should take
your own advice.

32:59.494 --> 33:00.787
I'll be fine.

33:03.999 --> 33:06.835
Well, you better be,
or I'll kill ya.

33:08.336 --> 33:09.671
Ew.

33:15.802 --> 33:17.054
Be good.

33:27.189 --> 33:29.275
- [man groans]
- ...my house!

33:36.073 --> 33:38.617
That's right,
pull your gun out.

33:38.658 --> 33:39.993
Shoot.

33:41.453 --> 33:43.747
Yeah, that's what I thought.

33:43.789 --> 33:45.207
And when JD gets here,

33:45.249 --> 33:46.250
you tell 'em.

33:46.292 --> 33:48.294
No guns at my house.

33:48.335 --> 33:51.671
All this shit 'cause you bought
some kids on the Internet!

34:19.032 --> 34:20.408
[gate clatters]

34:20.449 --> 34:21.701
[Richard] Easy.

34:24.704 --> 34:26.248
I don't want any trouble.

34:31.170 --> 34:32.879
I just came to talk.

34:32.920 --> 34:35.715
You bring a gun into my house,

34:35.757 --> 34:37.384
in front of my kids,

34:38.051 --> 34:40.262
and you wanna talk?

34:40.304 --> 34:42.181
I have nothin' to say to you.

34:42.222 --> 34:44.141
[all grunting]

34:55.235 --> 34:57.321
Get up, get up!

35:02.868 --> 35:04.661
[Richard screaming]

35:11.293 --> 35:14.046
This is the last time
you come into my house

35:14.087 --> 35:15.922
and disrespect me.

35:19.467 --> 35:20.468
Kill him.

35:20.510 --> 35:21.720
[Richard screams]

35:21.761 --> 35:22.846
[Carlos screams]

35:22.888 --> 35:25.182
[screaming]

35:33.773 --> 35:35.025
So now you ready to talk?

35:35.067 --> 35:36.109
Eat shit.

35:36.151 --> 35:38.778
A little girl's
been kidnapped.

35:38.820 --> 35:41.198
What do you know about kids
being sold on the deep web?

35:41.240 --> 35:43.325
You know,
I just started walking...

35:44.243 --> 35:45.827
without a cane.

35:45.869 --> 35:47.246
[Carlos screaming]

35:48.163 --> 35:49.998
All right,
all right, I'll talk.

35:50.916 --> 35:52.125
So talk, damn it.

35:52.167 --> 35:54.627
It's a guy named Chris
in North Phoenix.

35:55.337 --> 35:59.591
2341 North Helena Drive.

35:59.632 --> 36:02.010
That's it, man, that's it.
That's all I know.

36:02.386 --> 36:03.595
I swear.

36:04.512 --> 36:06.139
[pencil clatters]

36:08.767 --> 36:10.227
- [pencil thuds]
- [Carlos screams]

36:15.023 --> 36:18.360
[woman] <i>I think you're too
lenient with our son, sometimes.</i>

36:18.402 --> 36:20.446
<i>You shouldn't be hanging out.</i>

36:22.239 --> 36:24.950
[man]
Ah, don't move, don't.

36:24.991 --> 36:27.327
- Put the pizza down.
- OK.

36:29.496 --> 36:30.997
[man]
Where's your wallet?

36:31.998 --> 36:33.250
Come on.

36:37.504 --> 36:38.838
Solomon Bates.

36:40.173 --> 36:42.634
I know who you are,
keep it moving.

36:45.678 --> 36:47.931
- [door knocks]
- Pizza!

36:48.390 --> 36:49.641
Finally.

36:52.311 --> 36:53.895
[man] <i>I was just
puttin' it out there.</i>

36:56.273 --> 36:58.191
[woman] <i>I think you're
still living in the past</i>

36:58.233 --> 37:01.736
<i>where boys and girls
are separate.</i>

37:01.778 --> 37:04.864
- Go, go, go, go!
- [Caden whimpers]

37:04.906 --> 37:06.241
Drop it. Stand up.

37:06.283 --> 37:08.243
- Where's your phone?
- Uh, in my bag.

37:08.285 --> 37:09.619
Give it to me.

37:19.296 --> 37:20.380
Yo, what about her?

37:20.422 --> 37:21.756
Leave her, let's go,

37:21.798 --> 37:23.509
we ain't pickin' her up.

37:25.469 --> 37:29.264
[footsteps scrape]

37:35.354 --> 37:36.855
[Richard] Caden?

37:39.732 --> 37:41.234
Where's...

37:42.319 --> 37:43.695
Sarah?

37:52.287 --> 37:53.330
[gasps]

37:53.372 --> 37:55.207
Uh, easy, easy.

37:55.248 --> 37:57.000
Easy.

37:58.585 --> 38:00.587
[panting]

38:05.633 --> 38:07.052
Tell your friend...

38:08.345 --> 38:10.138
thank you for me.

38:10.180 --> 38:11.639
He's not gonna do it again.

38:12.432 --> 38:14.184
Did you...

38:15.602 --> 38:17.479
did you see who took Sarah?

38:20.190 --> 38:22.234
There were two of 'em.

38:24.486 --> 38:27.989
Uh, one had a...
had an arm sling.

38:33.537 --> 38:34.913
Where's my vest?

38:35.288 --> 38:36.789
Be careful.

38:36.831 --> 38:39.000
[phone ringing]

38:42.379 --> 38:43.796
[Doc] <i>Richard?</i>

39:05.944 --> 39:07.571
[Richard]
Where is she?!

39:08.405 --> 39:10.156
Tell me where she is!

39:20.584 --> 39:22.502
Tell me where my sister is!

39:26.172 --> 39:27.674
He'll rape her.

39:28.675 --> 39:31.219
He'll rape her till
she passes out.

39:31.261 --> 39:34.139
Then he'll wake her up
and do it again.

39:34.180 --> 39:36.099
[groaning]

39:46.151 --> 39:48.153
[panting]

39:56.953 --> 39:58.497
Shit.

40:04.252 --> 40:05.712
[gun clatters]

40:30.362 --> 40:33.031
[coughing]

40:36.826 --> 40:38.203
[sighs]

40:40.205 --> 40:41.581
- Richard.
- Doc.

40:41.623 --> 40:42.582
How you feelin'?

40:42.624 --> 40:43.833
Feel like I'm dyin'.

40:43.875 --> 40:45.293
We're all dyin' son.

40:45.335 --> 40:47.587
It's just a matter
of when and how.

40:49.797 --> 40:51.466
So, you have any
soreness or pain

40:51.508 --> 40:53.510
that's not
physically inflicted?

40:54.511 --> 40:56.804
Just some stomach
and chest pain.

40:57.805 --> 40:59.391
Your stomach's hurting?

41:00.808 --> 41:03.102
Yeah, yeah, little bit.

41:07.190 --> 41:08.650
And I suppose
you've been checking

41:08.692 --> 41:11.152
your blood pressure like
I asked you to, right?

41:12.153 --> 41:13.821
All the time, sir.

41:15.198 --> 41:16.491
Uh-huh.

41:18.577 --> 41:21.829
All right, let's take
a closer look, shall we?

41:23.915 --> 41:26.042
[glasses click]

41:27.794 --> 41:30.338
[glasses whir]

41:30.380 --> 41:33.966
All right, you're gonna
hold completely still,

41:34.967 --> 41:36.720
and don't move.

41:43.893 --> 41:45.645
You're having tightness
in your heart, aren't you?

41:45.687 --> 41:47.564
[Richard] Yes, sir.

41:47.606 --> 41:49.899
And the headaches,
they're a lot worse

41:49.941 --> 41:51.693
than what you're
tellin' me, aren't they?

41:51.735 --> 41:52.985
Yes, sir.

41:53.027 --> 41:56.948
Richard, I know you're
abusing the pills.

41:56.989 --> 42:00.243
I told you what would
happen if you did this.

42:00.285 --> 42:02.161
Basically, the pills
are destroying your body

42:02.203 --> 42:04.539
because of frequency of use.

42:04.581 --> 42:06.583
You have to lay off
and let your body rest.

42:06.625 --> 42:08.000
You keep this up...

42:09.795 --> 42:11.463
and they will kill you

42:11.504 --> 42:13.923
- Do you understand me?
- Yes, sir.

42:13.965 --> 42:16.092
Lay off.

42:16.134 --> 42:18.762
[water running]

42:21.681 --> 42:23.099
[panting]

42:31.941 --> 42:34.861
[door clicks]

42:47.373 --> 42:49.542
I'm sorry I had
to come back here.

42:53.296 --> 42:54.589
I just...

42:55.715 --> 42:58.009
didn't wanna
be alone right now.

42:59.385 --> 43:01.053
It's OK.

43:02.054 --> 43:04.056
Did you find out anything?

43:05.266 --> 43:06.934
About Sarah?

43:06.976 --> 43:08.311
No.

43:10.730 --> 43:12.231
I had a lead,

43:13.107 --> 43:14.693
and when I confronted him...

43:17.195 --> 43:20.072
he killed himself.

43:20.114 --> 43:22.742
That doesn't even
make any sense, I mean.

43:23.618 --> 43:26.078
[sighs] Oh, God.

43:27.789 --> 43:29.833
Things are getting
out of control, Richard.

43:29.875 --> 43:32.418
I mean, I tried
to be understanding,

43:32.460 --> 43:33.920
and I tried to let
things go your way,

43:33.961 --> 43:36.297
but clearly
that was a bad idea.

43:36.339 --> 43:38.717
- Don't start.
- You know what,

43:38.758 --> 43:41.135
you're too arrogant
for your own good.

43:43.638 --> 43:45.473
I don't need
a lecture right now.

43:45.515 --> 43:48.976
So if that's what you came here
for, then you can just leave.

43:49.018 --> 43:52.731
No, you're... you're
full of shit, Richard!

43:52.772 --> 43:54.232
All of this could've
been avoided

43:54.273 --> 43:57.652
if you'd just allowed
the detective to help you.

43:57.694 --> 43:59.111
Get out.

44:05.076 --> 44:06.327
Get out!

44:09.997 --> 44:11.624
Now!

44:12.792 --> 44:14.085
[weeping]

44:19.090 --> 44:20.592
[knock on door]

44:21.968 --> 44:23.595
[Majeed groans]

44:29.016 --> 44:30.309
What's up, man?

44:35.941 --> 44:37.984
The hell happened to you?

44:38.025 --> 44:40.653
I've been askin'
myself the same question.

44:41.654 --> 44:43.072
You want somethin' to drink?

44:44.156 --> 44:45.742
I'm good.

44:51.623 --> 44:54.459
You look like shit, homie.

44:54.500 --> 44:56.002
Got into a fight
with some people.

44:56.043 --> 44:57.796
Now that's some
gangster shit.

44:58.671 --> 45:00.298
That's why I came here.

45:01.466 --> 45:02.717
I need your help.

45:02.759 --> 45:04.385
I'm always down
to whoop some ass.

45:04.427 --> 45:06.178
My sister's been kidnapped.

45:06.220 --> 45:07.847
Shit.

45:07.889 --> 45:11.768
I think it's the same people
that took the other girl.

45:11.810 --> 45:14.479
I know you've been trying
to expand into that.

45:14.520 --> 45:16.314
I need your help
to get 'em out.

45:19.400 --> 45:20.652
You're family.

45:22.028 --> 45:23.738
I got your back.

46:03.569 --> 46:05.030
Are you ready?

46:19.878 --> 46:22.005
Good morning, ladies and gents.

46:22.047 --> 46:24.674
The day is finally upon us.

46:24.716 --> 46:26.676
I hope you're ready
with your checkbooks

46:26.718 --> 46:29.971
because we have
a delightful surprise for you,

46:30.013 --> 46:31.597
our loyal clients.

47:02.045 --> 47:03.337
What you've just seen

47:03.379 --> 47:06.132
is the new addition
to our collections.

47:06.173 --> 47:08.551
Normally, we would hold
an auction for it alone,

47:08.593 --> 47:12.055
but I've decided to
throw her in half off

47:12.097 --> 47:14.181
to the lucky winner today.

47:20.563 --> 47:22.648
- Take her and get her ready.
- Yes, sir.

47:22.690 --> 47:24.109
And clean her up.

47:25.068 --> 47:27.070
[Sarah whimpers]

48:12.949 --> 48:14.617
You sure this
is the right spot?

48:14.659 --> 48:16.494
- Yeah.
- [gun clatters]

48:16.535 --> 48:17.745
You strapped?

48:17.787 --> 48:20.372
I don't need a gun.

48:20.414 --> 48:22.875
Goin' in without a gun.

48:23.417 --> 48:24.710
Let's go.

48:33.385 --> 48:34.846
Going through the front
gets you shot.

48:34.887 --> 48:37.598
- [Richard] It doesn't matter.
- I'm out then.

48:38.599 --> 48:40.101
You got a better idea?

48:40.143 --> 48:44.396
Yeah, go through the back,
catch 'em by surprise.

48:48.693 --> 48:51.237
All right.
I'll go 'round back

48:51.278 --> 48:53.865
and make some noise
to bring 'em out there.

48:53.906 --> 48:57.035
Then, you bust
through the front.

48:57.076 --> 48:58.410
All right.

49:21.350 --> 49:22.810
[breathing heavily]

49:22.852 --> 49:24.812
- [blow lands]
- [Richard groans]

49:33.612 --> 49:35.698
[panting]

49:37.909 --> 49:39.202
[chuckle]

49:42.955 --> 49:45.666
Good, you're up.

49:45.708 --> 49:47.210
What's going on?

49:48.627 --> 49:50.880
I knocked you out.

49:51.714 --> 49:53.049
Why?

49:54.633 --> 49:56.385
For the money.

49:57.262 --> 49:58.846
You sold me out.

49:59.680 --> 50:02.267
I sold you
and your sister out.

50:02.892 --> 50:04.227
I'ma kill you,

50:04.269 --> 50:07.146
and sell your sister
to the highest bidder.

50:10.775 --> 50:13.278
It's my way
into the business.

50:21.119 --> 50:22.870
[groaning]

50:31.462 --> 50:33.631
[groaning]

50:48.146 --> 50:50.439
[Richard groaning]

51:06.538 --> 51:08.791
[accelerated heartbeat]

51:35.776 --> 51:37.862
[Richard coughing]

51:43.326 --> 51:45.494
Hey.

51:45.536 --> 51:47.705
Be careful not to
reopen your wounds.

51:50.166 --> 51:51.750
What happened?

51:51.792 --> 51:53.460
He...

51:53.502 --> 51:55.296
saved your life.

52:00.801 --> 52:02.345
How did you know
where to find me?

52:02.387 --> 52:06.391
Well, you told me
to do my job.

52:07.266 --> 52:08.684
So I did.

52:09.894 --> 52:11.687
I found you laying
next to a corpse.

52:11.729 --> 52:13.731
That's why you got
the cuffs on you.

52:15.107 --> 52:16.692
You got some explaining to do.

52:19.070 --> 52:20.779
What time is it?

52:21.322 --> 52:23.366
It's 10 o'clock.

52:24.367 --> 52:26.202
No, no.

52:26.244 --> 52:28.329
Hey, relax, you're fine.

52:29.830 --> 52:31.457
Once the auction's complete,

52:31.498 --> 52:34.001
they ship the girls over
to a remote location

52:34.043 --> 52:36.295
where the buyers pick 'em up.

52:36.337 --> 52:38.047
That process takes
place tomorrow.

52:38.089 --> 52:40.591
- So when are we heading out?
- We?

52:40.632 --> 52:42.260
Look,
you're not going anywhere.

52:43.094 --> 52:44.345
My team and I,

52:44.387 --> 52:45.637
we've got it figured out.

52:45.679 --> 52:48.391
- You have to let me go.
- Look...

52:49.850 --> 52:51.310
I know that you don't
have anything to do

52:51.352 --> 52:52.603
with the kidnapping.

52:53.396 --> 52:55.189
I also know they have Sarah.

52:58.401 --> 53:00.319
Now you still have
a dead man...

53:02.863 --> 53:04.490
that needs to be answered for.

53:04.531 --> 53:09.036
So unfortunately,
until that gets sorted out,

53:11.122 --> 53:12.831
you're on house arrest.

53:15.376 --> 53:17.878
I wanna make myself
perfectly clear.

53:20.298 --> 53:21.966
You violate that,

53:22.007 --> 53:23.426
you're going straight to jail.

53:23.468 --> 53:25.552
Now you two
have a good night.

53:36.314 --> 53:37.606
[Richard sighs]

53:58.419 --> 53:59.795
[Richard sighs]

54:08.429 --> 54:10.597
Can you push me in the cart
like you used to?

54:10.639 --> 54:11.974
No.

54:12.850 --> 54:13.851
It'll be fun.

54:13.892 --> 54:15.019
Come on, Sarah.

54:15.060 --> 54:16.354
Please?

54:18.439 --> 54:19.857
Please?

54:22.693 --> 54:25.154
- Fine.
- Yes!

54:29.033 --> 54:31.952
[Sarah laughing]

54:49.470 --> 54:51.472
I expected more of a fight.

54:51.514 --> 54:53.140
It's pointless.

54:54.766 --> 54:57.644
Sarah's in trouble,
and you think it's pointless

54:57.686 --> 54:59.063
to try and save her?

54:59.104 --> 55:01.566
Everything I've
done up to this point...

55:03.942 --> 55:06.237
it's only made things worse.

55:06.278 --> 55:07.321
It's only made things worse

55:07.363 --> 55:08.280
because you've tried to

55:08.322 --> 55:10.324
do it all by yourself.

55:10.782 --> 55:12.076
You heard him.

55:12.993 --> 55:15.162
Go to jail if
I leave the house.

55:15.204 --> 55:17.456
Since when do you
listen to anyone?

55:22.961 --> 55:24.255
What do you want me to do?

55:24.296 --> 55:26.798
I want you to get off your ass

55:26.840 --> 55:28.342
and save Sarah!

55:40.271 --> 55:41.606
No?

55:43.566 --> 55:44.816
Fine.

55:45.276 --> 55:47.361
- Cade?
- What?

55:50.822 --> 55:52.199
[groans]

56:17.724 --> 56:19.310
Thank you.

[body thuds]

56:51.676 --> 56:54.011
Detective.

56:54.052 --> 56:55.971
What the hell are you
doing outside of your house?

56:56.013 --> 56:59.433
Look, I know you're mad,
but please hear me out.

56:59.475 --> 57:02.561
- No.
- No please, Detective.

57:02.603 --> 57:04.480
You have to let me
help save my sister.

57:04.522 --> 57:06.691
Afterwards, I'll be more
than happy to go to jail.

57:06.732 --> 57:08.651
- You ruined that chance.
- Please!

57:08.693 --> 57:10.695
I could've went alone,
but I came to you instead.

57:10.736 --> 57:12.613
Yeah, that's because you
didn't know where to go.

57:12.655 --> 57:15.824
I found the kidnapper's
house by myself, didn't I?

57:22.247 --> 57:23.499
Please, Detective.

57:25.376 --> 57:28.420
All right, look.

57:28.462 --> 57:29.588
If you come with us,

57:29.630 --> 57:32.216
you stay the hell
out of our way.

57:32.257 --> 57:34.092
I promise.

57:35.427 --> 57:36.762
Thank you.

57:36.803 --> 57:39.223
Thank me later, come on.

57:56.948 --> 57:58.909
[girl whimpers]

58:06.584 --> 58:07.959
Put 'em in their cell.

58:08.001 --> 58:09.336
[Sarah groaning]

58:20.180 --> 58:23.350
Set up the live feed, and make sure
we don't lose signal like last time.

58:37.030 --> 58:38.365
Come.

58:44.955 --> 58:46.791
[whimpering]

58:49.376 --> 58:50.711
Good girl.

59:08.979 --> 59:11.106
[wrapper crinkles]

01:00:05.870 --> 01:00:07.245
Fetch.

01:00:07.287 --> 01:00:08.997
[whimpering]

01:00:12.543 --> 01:00:15.379
What are you standin'
around for, get to work!

01:00:19.550 --> 01:00:22.093
- What do you want me to do?
- Just hang back, you let us do our job.

01:00:22.135 --> 01:00:24.930
- I came here to help.
- Get your ass back in the car.

01:00:32.145 --> 01:00:33.898
All right, the plan
is to stop them

01:00:33.939 --> 01:00:35.733
before the transaction
is complete, OK?

01:00:35.774 --> 01:00:37.067
Our priority is to
save the captives.

01:00:37.108 --> 01:00:38.652
What about the scumbags
buyin' the girls?

01:00:38.694 --> 01:00:39.904
Well, we have a team in place
hacking their service.

01:00:39.945 --> 01:00:41.906
- Any questions?
- Let's do it.

01:00:41.947 --> 01:00:43.281
All right, let's go.

01:01:02.718 --> 01:01:04.469
Let's congratulate Mr. Smith,

01:01:04.511 --> 01:01:06.054
our most recent winner.

01:01:06.096 --> 01:01:07.639
This concludes our auction.

01:01:07.681 --> 01:01:10.392
Be sure to check back next
month for fresh merchandise.

01:01:10.434 --> 01:01:13.645
Until then, I bid you farewell.

01:01:17.733 --> 01:01:20.694
Mr. Smith is the only one who likes
to pick up his girls personally,

01:01:20.736 --> 01:01:22.738
and he's punctual,
so get 'em out,

01:01:22.780 --> 01:01:23.655
and move 'em downstairs.

01:01:23.697 --> 01:01:25.031
You got it.

01:01:49.306 --> 01:01:50.390
What are you doing?

01:01:50.432 --> 01:01:52.058
- Cops!
- Shit.

01:01:52.100 --> 01:01:54.019
Put 'em in their cells
and get out there.

01:01:54.060 --> 01:01:55.312
Lead the cops away
from this room.

01:01:55.353 --> 01:01:57.105
What are you gonna
do if we can't?

01:01:57.147 --> 01:01:59.190
You will,
or I'll kill you myself!

01:02:47.531 --> 01:02:49.407
- [gun clicks]
- Shit.

01:03:21.023 --> 01:03:22.524

01:04:40.769 --> 01:04:43.147
Didn't I tell you to
keep your ass in the car?

01:04:49.111 --> 01:04:50.612
You're welcome.

01:04:50.654 --> 01:04:52.990
You just love to
disobey orders, don't you?

01:04:53.031 --> 01:04:54.908
It saved your life.

01:05:00.205 --> 01:05:01.957
Shit.

01:05:01.999 --> 01:05:04.417
Come on, let's go,
the others need help.

01:05:14.552 --> 01:05:15.971

- I'm good!

01:05:30.861 --> 01:05:33.155
- Drop it!
- Screw you!

01:05:49.587 --> 01:05:50.964
Mr. Smith, hi.

01:05:51.965 --> 01:05:53.175
I suggest you not come.

01:05:53.217 --> 01:05:55.719
We're experiencing
some difficulties.

01:05:55.760 --> 01:05:59.097
No, rest assured,
your merchandise will be delivered to you.

01:06:02.308 --> 01:06:03.643
Sarah?

01:06:06.813 --> 01:06:09.274
Hey. Are you OK?

01:06:12.277 --> 01:06:13.987

01:06:35.133 --> 01:06:36.426
Ow!

01:06:36.467 --> 01:06:38.262
That's how you repay me?

01:07:06.123 --> 01:07:07.207
You OK?

01:07:07.249 --> 01:07:08.833
[Richard groans]

01:07:08.875 --> 01:07:10.627
You need some help
holding that gun?

01:07:10.668 --> 01:07:13.088
[Richard] Shut up!

01:07:13.130 --> 01:07:14.798
- On your knees!
- Or what?

01:07:14.839 --> 01:07:16.758
If you wanted to kill me,
you'd already've done it.

01:08:20.613 --> 01:08:21.865
Show me.

01:08:30.247 --> 01:08:33.542
Dr. Ekon, you gotta get better
control of your experiments,

01:08:33.584 --> 01:08:35.752
especially the ones
wearing my face.

01:08:35.795 --> 01:08:37.046
Yes, sir.

01:08:37.755 --> 01:08:39.006
Believe me...

01:08:40.591 --> 01:08:42.010
this won't happen again.

01:08:42.051 --> 01:08:44.179
Be sure it doesn't.

01:08:44.220 --> 01:08:46.680
Now clean this mess up.

01:08:59.277 --> 01:09:00.569
Have a seat.

01:09:06.701 --> 01:09:08.036
It's been settled.

01:09:10.330 --> 01:09:11.415
Richard has agreed to the terms

01:09:11.456 --> 01:09:12.832
in favor of a full pardon,

01:09:12.874 --> 01:09:15.210
so we've wiped away
Richard's criminal records,

01:09:15.252 --> 01:09:17.795
and he's now been reinstated
into active service.

01:09:20.631 --> 01:09:22.091
Another fine job, Mr. Peele.

01:09:22.133 --> 01:09:23.509
I'll be in touch.
