00:12.800 --> 00:14.935
You've made your point,
andy.

00:14.969 --> 00:16.937
So they closed
the machine shop

00:16.971 --> 00:18.939
And turned it into
an espresso bar.

00:18.973 --> 00:21.475
That doesn't make you
a bad provider.

00:23.110 --> 00:26.379
Look, this is crazy.
It's the East River.

00:26.414 --> 00:29.750
The only thing you're gonna
catch out here is a cold.

00:29.784 --> 00:32.218
ooh.

00:38.292 --> 00:40.827
oh, my god.

00:49.437 --> 00:52.472
Can you believe my old
grade school shirt still fits?

00:52.506 --> 00:54.974
Oh, like a glove, yes.
A shirt, no.

00:55.008 --> 00:56.909
You look like
the incredible hulk.

00:56.944 --> 00:58.878
Nice, dad.
Yeah, that's what you get

00:58.912 --> 01:00.880
When you talk to him
while he's writing.

01:00.914 --> 01:02.982
Mm. Well,
Gracie's gonna love it.

01:03.016 --> 01:05.184
It'll crack her up when
she sees it. Gracie?

01:05.218 --> 01:07.352
Little cutie whose family
moved off to--

01:07.387 --> 01:10.155
I want to say kansas?
After fifth grade.

01:10.190 --> 01:13.693
She e-mailed me she was coming
to town to check out F.I.T,

01:13.727 --> 01:16.228
So I told her she could
spend the night. I asked you.

01:16.262 --> 01:18.363
Was I writing?

01:21.001 --> 01:24.236
"incredible hulk"?

01:24.270 --> 01:26.405
Gracie!

01:28.609 --> 01:30.174
Look at you, greendale girl.

01:30.209 --> 01:32.376
L-look at you.

01:32.411 --> 01:34.879
Hi.
Hi.

01:34.914 --> 01:37.515
Uh, you remember gram
and my dad.

01:37.549 --> 01:41.185
Sure. Hey.
It's been forever.

01:41.220 --> 01:44.255
Thanks again for letting me
crash with you guys. Yeah.

01:44.289 --> 01:46.658
So your room
in the same place?

01:46.692 --> 01:48.660
Yeah. Same place,
same old room.

01:48.694 --> 01:51.562
You know, everything the same.
almost.

02:00.640 --> 02:03.374
Looks like someone's
not in kansas anymore.

02:03.408 --> 02:05.442
What happened
to the little hair band,

02:05.476 --> 02:07.444
The knee socks?
Mm.

02:10.615 --> 02:13.383
Ah, Beckett.
Excellent timing.

02:13.417 --> 02:16.219
She used to be
so adorable.

02:16.254 --> 02:18.221
I mean, what makes a girl--

02:18.256 --> 02:20.223
A little girl
who used to play hopscotch

02:20.258 --> 02:21.892
And my little ponies--

02:21.926 --> 02:23.560
Suddenly pierce her eyebrow?

02:23.594 --> 02:25.228
It's like
she's been assimilated

02:25.263 --> 02:26.730
By the leather overlords.

02:26.765 --> 02:28.565
You're probably
romanticizing it.

02:28.599 --> 02:30.233
And is anything ever really

02:30.268 --> 02:32.870
The way that we remember it in
grade school? Well, to be honest,

02:32.904 --> 02:35.039
Beyond some
baking soda volcanoes

02:35.073 --> 02:36.406
And sweaty palms,

02:36.440 --> 02:38.408
I have very little memory
of it at all.

02:38.442 --> 02:39.576
You?

02:39.610 --> 02:41.244
mine are mostly orthodontic.

02:41.279 --> 02:44.548
Braces? You mean you weren't
born with that dazzling smile?

02:44.582 --> 02:46.550
The only thing dazzling
was how long

02:46.584 --> 02:48.951
It took my parents
to pay for it.

02:48.986 --> 02:50.953
Body's in pretty good shape
for a floater.

02:50.988 --> 02:53.089
Must not have been
in the water too long.

02:53.123 --> 02:55.592
Well, if the river's
as cold as my nose,

02:55.626 --> 02:58.828
I'd ballpark it within
the last 12 hours, at most.

02:58.862 --> 03:01.097
No I.D.,
but he looks early 40s.

03:01.131 --> 03:03.400
He's got a navy tattoo
on his arm

03:03.434 --> 03:06.336
And a nasty crush injury
along his temporal line.

03:06.370 --> 03:08.004
Any chance he went overboard?

03:08.038 --> 03:10.206
Classic indicators point to
deliberate blunt force,

03:10.240 --> 03:11.708
So I'd say no.

03:11.742 --> 03:13.576
This was no boating accident.

03:15.112 --> 03:18.414
Then we better close
the beaches.

03:18.448 --> 03:20.583
"no boating accident"?

03:20.617 --> 03:22.919
Chief brody? Hooper?

03:24.287 --> 03:26.022
Seriously?

03:26.056 --> 03:29.625
I'll, uh, zip his prints over
to the precinct for an I.D.,

03:29.659 --> 03:31.961
But for what it's worth,
I did find this.

03:31.995 --> 03:34.864
A Gamblers Anonymous
medallion.

03:34.898 --> 03:36.465
Four years without a bet.

03:36.499 --> 03:39.168
Ahh.
"ahh," what?

03:39.203 --> 03:41.270
The East River, a G.A. chip?

03:41.304 --> 03:43.772
Relapsed gambler gets in
too deep with his bookie,

03:43.806 --> 03:46.274
Ends up floating in the drink.

03:46.308 --> 03:47.776
Are you kidding me?

03:47.810 --> 03:50.145
You just went from
Gamblers Anonymous to mob hit?

03:50.179 --> 03:52.147
This is the most celebrated
body depository

03:52.181 --> 03:54.149
This side
of the Jersey wetlands.

03:54.183 --> 03:57.018
Mark my words--
this guy has mob ties.

03:57.053 --> 03:59.487
Case closed.

03:59.521 --> 04:01.656
No mob ties.

04:01.690 --> 04:03.191
Are you sure?

04:03.226 --> 04:05.160
Good work.

04:05.194 --> 04:07.829
According to his fingerprints,
his name is Donald Hayes--

04:07.864 --> 04:10.132
Navy veteran,
served in Desert Storm,

04:10.166 --> 04:12.134
And he's been a dock worker
since '94.

04:12.168 --> 04:15.335
And somehow
still employed as one.

04:15.370 --> 04:17.536
Our victim Donny Hayes--
currently clocked in

04:17.572 --> 04:21.007
And on duty at the east side
docks. which either means

04:21.041 --> 04:22.977
He's an incredibly
dedicated zombie...

04:23.011 --> 04:24.979
Or he's a suspect
in our murder.

04:27.582 --> 04:29.049
Donny.

04:29.084 --> 04:31.752
Mr. Hayes.

04:33.588 --> 04:35.790
Donald Hayes.

04:37.859 --> 04:41.528
What's the matter?
You forget your own name?

04:41.562 --> 04:43.997
Police. Don't move.

04:45.365 --> 04:47.167
ugh!

04:47.201 --> 04:49.068
The man said, "don't move."

04:49.103 --> 04:51.404
oh.
Wait a minute.

04:51.438 --> 04:54.240
Wait a minute.
You're just cops?

04:54.275 --> 04:56.242
Just cops?

04:56.277 --> 05:00.180
I guess that makes you
just under arrest for murder.

05:00.214 --> 05:03.950
first name Grant,
last name Vyro.

05:03.984 --> 05:05.651
I didn't kill anybody.

05:05.686 --> 05:07.887
Then why'd you run?
I thought you was with union.

05:07.922 --> 05:10.890
Oh, so we're not the only ones
who have a problem

05:10.925 --> 05:11.760
<i>With you killing Donny for his union card?</i>

05:11.800 --> 05:14.400
What are you talking about?
I bought that card.

05:14.628 --> 05:16.595
Do you really
expect us to believe

05:16.630 --> 05:18.731
That you bought Donny's card,
assumed his identity,

05:18.765 --> 05:21.734
And thought
no one would notice?

05:21.768 --> 05:25.404
Guy spent 16 years
working over on the west side.

05:25.439 --> 05:27.406
So I switched
to the east side docks

05:27.441 --> 05:29.709
So no one who knew Donny
would catch on.

05:29.743 --> 05:32.611
So what does a union card
go for nowadays

05:32.646 --> 05:34.613
Since buying someone else's
is illegal?

05:34.648 --> 05:37.282
Sucker cost me 25 grand.
Oh, come on, Vyro.

05:37.317 --> 05:40.118
Dock workers rake in
over six figures a year.

05:40.153 --> 05:43.422
Why would Donny
trade it in for so little?

05:43.457 --> 05:45.558
Unless he had a gun
to his head,

05:45.592 --> 05:48.192
In which case, it'd be a bargain.
There were no guns.

05:48.227 --> 05:50.462
I needed a job. Donny needed cash.
For what?

05:50.496 --> 05:52.897
He didn't say,
and I didn't care.

05:54.900 --> 05:56.868
Beckett.

05:56.902 --> 05:58.870
I was right about
the blunt force trauma.

05:58.904 --> 06:01.506
A single blow
caved in the ridge here

06:01.540 --> 06:03.508
Along Donny's
squamosal suture.

06:03.542 --> 06:05.910
And whatever did the damage
was kind enough

06:05.944 --> 06:09.914
To leave this shard of red glass
embedded in his skull.

06:09.948 --> 06:11.883
Maybe a heavy vase
or a bottle?

06:11.917 --> 06:13.885
I'll have forensics
take a look at it,

06:13.919 --> 06:15.720
See if they can find
a match.

06:15.755 --> 06:17.721
Based on lividity
and water temp,

06:17.756 --> 06:19.723
I've narrowed time of death

06:19.758 --> 06:21.925
To between 4:00 and 6:00 A.M.
This morning.

06:21.959 --> 06:24.261
What happened here on
the shoulder? Buckshot.

06:24.295 --> 06:27.464
I found several
double-ought pellets

06:27.499 --> 06:29.767
Lodged in the flesh
of his left arm.

06:29.801 --> 06:32.168
So someone conked him
on the head and shot him?

06:32.203 --> 06:34.170
That's where it gets weird.
Scarring indicates

06:34.205 --> 06:36.607
The pellets have been there
about two to three weeks.

06:36.641 --> 06:39.943
And he just left 'em in there? Well,
he certainly didn't seek treatment.

06:39.977 --> 06:42.178
Could've been, he was
in something illegal

06:42.213 --> 06:44.581
Or scared of whoever shot him. Or both.

06:44.616 --> 06:46.116
forget Vyro.

06:46.150 --> 06:48.118
His alibi cleared,
and we tracked down

06:48.152 --> 06:50.119
His personal check
for $25,000,

06:50.153 --> 06:52.988
Endorsed and deposited
by Donny last month.

06:53.023 --> 06:56.492
Vyro paid Donny with a check?
Not mobby enough for you, Castle?

06:56.527 --> 06:58.494
C.S.U.'s still combing
Donny's place,

06:58.529 --> 07:01.697
But no broken red glass,
no signs of foul play,

07:01.732 --> 07:04.634
And no next of kin, either. What
about the Gamblers Anonymous chip?

07:04.668 --> 07:07.804
Any sponsor? Yeah, but he says he
hasn't heard from Donny for months.

07:07.838 --> 07:09.806
So then maybe
Castle was right.

07:09.840 --> 07:12.542
If Donny was desperate enough
to sell his union card,

07:12.576 --> 07:14.200
Then maybe he fell off the wagon
and got in over his head.

07:14.280 --> 07:16.000
Yeah, to the tune of 25 grand.

07:16.379 --> 07:19.348
Yo. Uh, that'd be
lowballing it, bro.

07:19.382 --> 07:23.285
Donny's account shows
that he deposited Vyro's check

07:23.320 --> 07:26.188
About a month ago, adding it
to his existing balance

07:26.222 --> 07:27.756
Of $125,000,

07:27.790 --> 07:29.959
All of which--wait for it--

07:29.993 --> 07:31.660
is now gone.

07:31.694 --> 07:34.063
Gone?
All of it?

07:34.097 --> 07:36.065
Except for
the remaining balance of $6.23,

07:36.099 --> 07:39.168
All the 150k was spent
in one giant check,

07:39.202 --> 07:41.170
Made payable
to a Wilbur Pittorino,

07:41.204 --> 07:43.105
Listed here as owning
several properties,

07:43.139 --> 07:45.107
As well
as a waste management business

07:45.141 --> 07:48.277
In garfield, New Jersey.
Oh! Waste management.

07:48.311 --> 07:50.245
Any priors?
Yeah.

07:50.280 --> 07:52.948
Back in 1977, Billy Pitt
spent 10 years in federal

07:52.982 --> 07:55.216
For assault and racketeering.

07:55.250 --> 07:57.385
And what?
Racketeering.

07:58.955 --> 08:00.922
As well as shaking down
business owners

08:00.957 --> 08:03.725
Where he operated his, uh,
bookmaking operation.

08:03.759 --> 08:05.760
His what now?
Bookmaking operation.

08:05.795 --> 08:08.096
Oh, so an ex-gambler

08:08.130 --> 08:11.566
Dumps his life savings
on an ex-con ex-bookmaker,

08:11.601 --> 08:13.568
And ends up exed out.

08:13.603 --> 08:16.571
Sounds like Donny was late with
his 150 grand for Billy Pitt,

08:16.606 --> 08:19.073
And he ended up paying for it
with his life.

08:19.108 --> 08:21.543
I think I just said that.

08:21.577 --> 08:24.545
"Castle"
Season 3, Episode 10 - "Last Call"

08:24.579 --> 08:27.948
Sync and corrected by
www.addic7ed.com

08:34.799 --> 08:37.702
You know, you might have gotten
a little grayer, Mr. Pitt,

08:37.736 --> 08:40.705
But it seems to me,
you haven't changed much at all.

08:40.739 --> 08:42.740
Must be
all them Pilates classes.

08:45.478 --> 08:47.479
Do you recognize
this check?

08:47.513 --> 08:49.681
Of course.
It's from Donny Hayes. So?

08:49.715 --> 08:52.016
So I'm wondering if Donny
didn't owe you more money,

08:52.050 --> 08:54.786
And you didn't flash back to your old
racketeering days. Tap the brakes, sweetie.

08:54.820 --> 08:57.421
Whatever the hell
you dragged me down here for,

08:57.456 --> 09:00.424
<i>I wanna tell you right now that
I paid my tab with johnny law</i>

09:00.459 --> 09:02.425
<i>A couple of lifetimes ago,</i>

09:02.460 --> 09:05.496
<i>And he's got nothing on me since.
oh, this guy is gold.</i>

09:05.530 --> 09:08.966
And if you don't believe me,
why don't you ask... Donny?

09:09.000 --> 09:11.101
Is this about Donny?

09:11.135 --> 09:13.604
He was found dead
in the East River this morning.

09:13.638 --> 09:15.606
Now back to the money.
What was it for?

09:15.640 --> 09:17.841
Was it a payment
or was it a gift?

09:17.876 --> 09:19.676
A purchase.
For?

09:19.711 --> 09:22.178
He bought my bar downtown.
He loved the place.

09:22.213 --> 09:23.981
Really?
Enough to drop everything

09:24.015 --> 09:26.683
And dump
his whole life savings into it?

09:26.718 --> 09:28.685
Kid was practically raised
in the joint,

09:28.720 --> 09:30.554
By his grandfather,
Leo the Legend.

09:30.588 --> 09:32.989
Leo the Legend?
You heard of the guy?

09:33.023 --> 09:34.490
<i>Shh.
City's best bartender</i>

09:34.525 --> 09:36.492
Since the days
when "gay" meant "happy."

09:36.527 --> 09:39.161
He was the only father Donny
knew. And where do I find Leo?

09:39.195 --> 09:41.564
Resting in an old silver shaker
behind the bar.

09:41.598 --> 09:43.566
<i>Leo was kind of
the bar historian,</i>

09:43.600 --> 09:46.402
<i>And when he kicked in '97,</i>

09:46.436 --> 09:48.905
<i>We figured, hey,
why not make him part of it?</i>

09:48.939 --> 09:50.573
Ashes behind the bar.

09:50.607 --> 09:53.843
<i>Which is why Donny decided
to buy the--what is it called?</i>

09:53.877 --> 09:56.245
The
Old Haunt. The Old Haunt?

09:56.279 --> 09:58.581
Don't tell me you've never
been to the Old Haunt.

09:58.615 --> 10:00.850
It's legendary. All the great
writers drank there.

10:00.884 --> 10:02.985
We're cops. We go to
cop bars. Your loss.

10:03.020 --> 10:04.886
Donny was there
every night anyhow.

10:04.921 --> 10:06.888
We were
all the family he had.

10:06.923 --> 10:08.890
So what prompted
this sudden sale?

10:08.925 --> 10:11.492
I mean, it seemed like Donny had
to gather money pretty quickly.

10:11.527 --> 10:14.429
The bar had been weighing down
my ledger sheets for years.

10:14.463 --> 10:18.166
I had an offer from one of them
T.J. McChucklenuts franchises,

10:18.200 --> 10:20.168
When Brian, my bartender,
put together some investors

10:20.202 --> 10:22.170
And made an offer of his own.

10:22.204 --> 10:24.940
I was gonna sell it to him,
and then Donny outbid him.

10:24.974 --> 10:27.609
And how did Brian feel
when Donny bought the place?

10:27.643 --> 10:29.611
He wasn't thrilled about it,

10:29.645 --> 10:33.081
But at least he wasn't working
for T.J. McChucklenuts.

10:33.115 --> 10:35.515
Lanie just swabbed
the shard of glass

10:35.550 --> 10:38.251
And found trace amounts
of alcohol.

10:38.286 --> 10:39.753
A container
of alcoholic beverage,

10:39.788 --> 10:41.254
A resentful bartender...

10:41.289 --> 10:43.256
And given the location
of the Old Haunt,

10:43.291 --> 10:44.758
A potential crime scene

10:44.793 --> 10:46.526
Just two blocks
away from the river.

10:46.561 --> 10:49.096
Convenient for all
your body dumping needs.

10:49.130 --> 10:50.698
So, Castle...

10:50.732 --> 10:52.700
Can I buy you a drink?

10:52.734 --> 10:55.368
Why, detective Beckett,
I thought you'd never ask.

10:55.403 --> 10:58.371
so how well do you
know this bar, Castle?

10:58.406 --> 11:01.374
Oh, I haven't been here
in years. Not since Alexis.

11:01.409 --> 11:04.478
But I wrote most of my first
novel in one of these booths.

11:04.512 --> 11:06.946
<i>Oh. Okay, well,
that explains a lot.</i>

11:06.981 --> 11:09.048
It sold
over three million copies.

11:09.083 --> 11:11.050
No, I mean
why you're so excited.

11:11.085 --> 11:13.052
Oh, well, it's loaded
with history--

11:13.087 --> 11:15.422
First as a blacksmith,
then as a bordello.

11:15.456 --> 11:18.425
It only became a bar during
prohibition as a speakeasy,

11:18.459 --> 11:20.427
And it was one of the best.

11:20.461 --> 11:22.429
I swear, I can still feel
the vibration

11:22.463 --> 11:24.797
Of every notorious episode
of glamour and debauchery

11:24.832 --> 11:27.767
In its walls. Oh, easy,
Castle. It's just a bar.

11:27.801 --> 11:29.768
No, no, T.J. McChucklenuts
is just a bar.

11:29.802 --> 11:32.571
The Old Haunt is the last
of a dying breed

11:32.606 --> 11:34.806
Of proud institutions

11:34.841 --> 11:36.408
Standing up
to ruthless gentrification.

11:36.443 --> 11:38.410
It's a classic...

11:38.445 --> 11:40.146
What--what are you doing?

11:40.180 --> 11:42.148
Well, I'm not gonna get
much out of Brian

11:42.182 --> 11:44.350
Looking like a cop.

11:44.384 --> 11:45.851
Undercover. I like it.

11:45.885 --> 11:48.987
But you might want to pop
one more button, just in case.

11:59.533 --> 12:02.201
This is how a bar should
smell. Mm. Yeah. Stale beer.

12:02.235 --> 12:04.202
You know,
I'd write in more bars

12:04.236 --> 12:06.204
If there
were more bars like this.

12:09.475 --> 12:11.442
nice to see you, eddie.

12:11.477 --> 12:14.111
Been a long time.
Thank you for remembering.

12:14.146 --> 12:16.781
Come over here. Check out the wall of
fame.

12:16.815 --> 12:19.684
Who is that handsome devil
just two over from Hemingway,

12:19.718 --> 12:22.053
Directly above
the infamous booth where

12:22.087 --> 12:24.689
"in a hail of bullets" was
born? Oh, my goodness, Castle.

12:24.723 --> 12:27.825
you were so cute back then.

12:27.859 --> 12:30.562
Back then?

12:36.402 --> 12:37.835
A lot of memories.

12:37.869 --> 12:40.837
That's old Leo, which would
make that young Donny.

12:40.871 --> 12:44.140
But I don't see
any red bottles.

12:47.111 --> 12:49.479
What are you looking at?

12:49.514 --> 12:50.747
Nothing.

12:50.781 --> 12:52.916
Welcome to the Old Haunt,
folks.

12:52.950 --> 12:55.151
Uh, is Donny here,
by any chance?

12:55.186 --> 12:58.154
Not yet, but he will be,
and he won't mind one bit

12:58.189 --> 13:00.156
That you're sitting
in his regular spot,

13:00.191 --> 13:03.327
You know, I knew this place
felt right for a reason.

13:03.361 --> 13:06.330
I'm Kate.
I'm one of his old friends.

13:06.364 --> 13:09.499
And this is Rick.

13:09.534 --> 13:11.500
Brian.

13:11.535 --> 13:13.669
And any old friend
of Donny

13:13.704 --> 13:15.671
Is a new friend of mine.

13:15.706 --> 13:17.440
Tell me, Brian, um...

13:17.474 --> 13:19.943
You don't by any chance
carry a liqueur--

13:19.977 --> 13:23.279
<i>It's really delicious</i>

13:23.313 --> 13:26.082
And it comes in this
red bottle?

13:26.117 --> 13:27.350
Oh!

13:27.384 --> 13:29.352
Yeah, that, uh,
red bottle we shared

13:29.386 --> 13:33.356
Down in that little cantina
in Tierra del Fuego?

13:33.390 --> 13:35.458
Red, huh?

13:35.492 --> 13:37.060
Uh, let's see.

13:37.094 --> 13:40.764
No red here. Just your standard
brown, green, and clear.

13:40.798 --> 13:43.531
Uh, let me check the other end
of the bar. Did you see that?

13:43.566 --> 13:47.136
How could I miss it?
Can't he see we're together?

13:47.170 --> 13:49.204
Undercover.

13:49.239 --> 13:51.206
No, his reaction...
When I mentioned Donny.

13:51.241 --> 13:52.707
I don't think he knows.

13:52.742 --> 13:54.709
Maybe he's just
a good liar.

13:54.744 --> 13:56.578
ah, no luck.

13:56.612 --> 13:59.047
Maybe I could interest you
in a blue vodka?

13:59.082 --> 14:01.383
Oh, no, thank you.
Way too early for vodka.

14:01.417 --> 14:04.153
Well, think about it, folks.
I'll be back in a sec.

14:04.187 --> 14:08.223
Actually, Brian, we're not
really here for a drink.

14:08.258 --> 14:10.225
How could Donny be dead?

14:10.260 --> 14:12.560
I was
just with him last night.

14:12.595 --> 14:14.228
What time was that?

14:14.263 --> 14:16.464
4:30 A.M. I locked up
on my way out,

14:16.499 --> 14:20.168
And Donny went to do the books
in the office, like always.

14:20.202 --> 14:22.904
Are you sure he was alone
when you left?

14:22.938 --> 14:25.774
Positive.
Man, this is crazy.

14:25.808 --> 14:27.200
That guy was like a brother to me.

14:27.240 --> 14:28.600
Even though he bought the bar
out from under you?

14:28.611 --> 14:31.012
You know about that?

14:31.046 --> 14:33.448
I mean, he didn't even
offer you to be a partner.

14:33.482 --> 14:34.560
That doesn't sound very brotherly to me.

14:34.600 --> 14:36.400
Hey, any beef I had with Donny
was short-lived.

14:36.452 --> 14:38.085
We hashed it out.

14:38.120 --> 14:40.322
So now you're just stealing from him.
What?

14:40.356 --> 14:43.792
What? Couldn't help but notice
your trick with the fruit, Brian.

14:43.826 --> 14:45.859
You pretend
to ring up a drink,

14:45.893 --> 14:48.595
You stuff the money in the till,
and you keep track of it

14:48.630 --> 14:50.764
By throwing pieces of fruit
into the sink.

14:50.799 --> 14:53.634
Cherries are $10.
Limes, what, $20?

14:53.668 --> 14:56.670
At night's end, you tally up
your fruit so you know how much

14:56.705 --> 14:59.807
To put into your tip cup
before you lock the register.

14:59.841 --> 15:02.209
So what happened, Brian?
Donny catch you stealing?

15:02.243 --> 15:04.712
Things get physical?
Over an extra 30 or 40 bucks?

15:04.746 --> 15:07.548
That's not even stealing.
It's skimming. Donny understood.

15:07.582 --> 15:09.450
The owner understood?

15:09.484 --> 15:11.452
We'd all been family
long enough.

15:11.486 --> 15:15.188
Donny knew I had to get creative
to make my rent once in a while.

15:15.223 --> 15:18.358
I'd like to see his office.
Sure. It's in the basement.

15:18.392 --> 15:21.126
The basement?

15:21.161 --> 15:22.628
I've never seen this.

15:22.663 --> 15:24.864
No one knew it was there
until the flood of '98.

15:24.898 --> 15:26.866
Billy Pitt pulled up
the old linoleum,

15:26.900 --> 15:29.469
And there it was.

15:34.007 --> 15:35.641
a hidden basement.

15:35.676 --> 15:37.176
How cool is this?

15:37.210 --> 15:40.580
Did I say "cool"?

15:40.614 --> 15:42.548
Make that awesome.

15:42.583 --> 15:44.550
The perfect place
for a murder.

15:44.585 --> 15:47.218
No one can hear you scream.

15:47.253 --> 15:50.589
No one can help you carry
the body up the stairs either.

15:50.623 --> 15:52.591
Maybe somebody
marched Donny at gunpoint

15:52.625 --> 15:54.993
Down to the river,
killed him there.

15:55.027 --> 15:58.196
If the killer had a gun,
why would he use a bottle?

15:58.230 --> 16:00.399
Don't ruin my story
with your logic.

16:00.433 --> 16:02.300
It smells like fresh paint.

16:02.334 --> 16:05.270
yeah, Donny had been
putting in a lot of work

16:05.304 --> 16:07.272
To fix the place up--
new brass rail,

16:07.306 --> 16:10.642
Refurbished wood on the bar.

16:12.578 --> 16:14.479
you find something?

16:18.049 --> 16:19.850
These are buckshot holes.

16:32.431 --> 16:34.264
You own a shotgun,
Brian?

16:34.299 --> 16:37.100
No. C.S.U.'s gonna comb this
place from top to bottom--

16:37.135 --> 16:39.403
Blood, buckshot,
broken red glass.

16:39.438 --> 16:42.306
So if you have something to say--
look, if a shotgun was fired down here,

16:42.340 --> 16:44.308
Everybody in the bar
would know about it.

16:44.342 --> 16:46.577
Not if it was after hours.

16:46.611 --> 16:48.812
We're talking about
two or three weeks ago.

16:48.846 --> 16:52.148
Did Donny have a beef with anyone
then? You said two weeks ago?

16:52.182 --> 16:54.250
Uh, yeah.

16:54.284 --> 16:57.086
It was a couple of weeks ago.
I was, uh, closing up alone.

16:57.120 --> 17:00.089
I had just done my cash drop
down in the basement safe,

17:00.123 --> 17:02.759
And I came up, and some guy
was knocking on the door--

17:02.793 --> 17:04.761
Pick-up Pete.

17:04.795 --> 17:06.996
"pick-up Pete"?
Big hit with the ladies?

17:07.030 --> 17:09.065
No. He drives a pickup.

17:09.098 --> 17:11.099
Ah.
Gun rack?

17:11.134 --> 17:13.470
Yeah.
Regular upstate redneck.

17:13.503 --> 17:16.238
Anyway, he said that he dropped
his wallet in the booth,

17:16.272 --> 17:18.240
So I let him in.

17:18.275 --> 17:20.809
Next thing you know,
he's got his hands all over me.

17:20.844 --> 17:23.178
He's pushing me against the bar.
All of a sudden,

17:23.212 --> 17:24.813
The basement door pops open,

17:24.848 --> 17:26.982
And here comes Donny,
like Hemingway's ghost.

17:27.016 --> 17:28.917
Guess I missed him
down there,

17:28.952 --> 17:30.919
But I'm glad he showed up
when he did.

17:30.954 --> 17:32.821
He grabbed a baseball bat,
chased Pete out.

17:32.856 --> 17:34.322
He smashed his taillights,

17:34.357 --> 17:36.959
Put a few dents in the pickup
for good measure

17:36.993 --> 17:38.961
Before the jackass
could drive off.

17:38.995 --> 17:41.162
Donny told me to go home
and to forget about it.

17:41.197 --> 17:43.164
He said that Pete
was eighty-sixed for life.

17:43.199 --> 17:45.601
That was the last time we talked
about it until last night.

17:45.635 --> 17:48.036
And what happened last
night? Pete showed up again.

17:48.070 --> 17:51.038
Donny wasn't having any of it.
He just threw that trash out.

17:51.072 --> 17:52.540
Said the next time,

17:52.574 --> 17:54.876
It wouldn't be the truck
he used the bat on.

17:54.910 --> 17:57.277
So Donny eighty-sixed Pete
for life.

17:57.312 --> 18:00.247
Looks like Pete
returned the favor.

18:10.000 --> 18:14.069
Pick-up Pete,
a.K.A. Pete Mucha.

18:14.104 --> 18:16.571
He's got a couple of dismissed
domestic assault charges

18:16.606 --> 18:18.907
And he is also
the proud owner

18:18.941 --> 18:21.175
Of a Remington 870 shotgun.

18:22.712 --> 18:26.180
And Ryan and Esposito
are bringing him in now.

18:26.215 --> 18:28.449
What do you think
of "The Castillion"?

18:28.484 --> 18:30.084
For?

18:30.119 --> 18:32.086
Well, the Old Haunt
just reminded me

18:32.121 --> 18:34.623
Of how vital tavern culture is
in this town.

18:34.657 --> 18:37.692
I thought, why not open up
a little tavern of my own?

18:37.727 --> 18:39.961
So instead of buying a drink,

18:39.996 --> 18:42.397
You're gonna buy a whole bar?

18:42.431 --> 18:44.566
My way of giving back.

18:44.600 --> 18:47.301
Yeah, to your ego.
"The Ego."

18:47.336 --> 18:48.803
someone call the police!

18:48.838 --> 18:50.939
Let me go.
I'm perfectly fine!

18:50.973 --> 18:52.941
Pick-up Pete,
I take it.

18:52.975 --> 18:55.443
Yeah, we found him getting
tossed out of a bar uptown.

18:55.477 --> 18:57.445
And, uh, just like
the shotgun in his truck,

18:57.479 --> 18:59.380
He's a little loaded.
Ohh.

18:59.415 --> 19:02.550
Well, maybe a murder charge
will sober him up.

19:02.584 --> 19:04.252
Yeah. Come on.

19:07.056 --> 19:08.656
"the Castle."

19:08.690 --> 19:12.260
It'll just have
a wee drawbridge to let you in.

19:12.294 --> 19:13.928
congratulations, Pete.

19:13.962 --> 19:16.931
You're our drunkest
murder suspect this year,

19:16.965 --> 19:20.668
And that includes St.
Patrick's day. What did I win?

19:20.702 --> 19:24.004
Well, that depends on you,
Pete. You know my name, too?

19:24.039 --> 19:27.007
And did you just say "murder"?
Your driver's license says

19:27.042 --> 19:29.109
You're from up in cortland.

19:29.143 --> 19:31.111
What, they don't have
any bars up there,

19:31.145 --> 19:33.246
Or did you get eighty-sixed
from them, too?

19:33.281 --> 19:34.747
The city's where I work,

19:34.782 --> 19:36.749
You know, like drywall,
like pipe setting.

19:36.784 --> 19:39.752
And I do some of my best
pipe laying after work,

19:39.787 --> 19:43.523
If you know what I mean.

19:43.558 --> 19:45.758
Hey.

19:45.793 --> 19:49.262
You own a shotgun, Pete.

19:49.297 --> 19:50.763
You like hunting, do you?

19:50.798 --> 19:52.665
Wait a minute.

19:52.700 --> 19:55.702
You after me for murdering
a 2-point buck?

19:55.736 --> 19:58.204
Nah. We're after you
for your little dust up

19:58.238 --> 20:00.439
At the Old Haunt
two weeks ago.

20:00.474 --> 20:02.608
The Old Haunt!
That's where I was last night.

20:02.642 --> 20:04.276
Donny wouldn't let me in

20:04.311 --> 20:06.445
Because of
that bitch bartender.

20:06.480 --> 20:08.447
For the record,
she came on to me.

20:08.482 --> 20:10.483
That why you came back
and you killed him,

20:10.517 --> 20:13.685
'cause you were drunk and angry,
and he wouldn't let you in?

20:13.720 --> 20:15.854
Donny's dead?

20:15.888 --> 20:18.457
What'd you really do
last night, Pete?

20:18.492 --> 20:20.459
Whoa! Hey!

20:20.494 --> 20:22.661
Why would I kill the guy?

20:22.695 --> 20:25.664
Maybe because he trashed your truck.
And you were too drunk to shoot straight

20:25.698 --> 20:28.334
The last time you came after
him with a shotgun. Shotgun?

20:28.368 --> 20:30.635
Look, he trashed my truck.
So what?

20:30.669 --> 20:33.104
He more than paid
for the damages.

20:33.139 --> 20:35.106
he what now?

20:35.141 --> 20:37.875
After he pounded my truck,
I started calling the cops.

20:37.909 --> 20:40.878
Well, he calmed down real fast,
and out came this fat wad,

20:40.912 --> 20:44.882
And he peeled off a cool grand
like it was nothin'.

20:44.916 --> 20:47.918
Donny... Gave you $1,000?

20:47.953 --> 20:50.087
He had plenty more.

20:50.122 --> 20:52.357
I asked him, "what,
did you score lotto?"

20:52.391 --> 20:54.992
And he was all like,
"yeah, sorta."

20:55.027 --> 20:57.162
You can ask my repair guy.

20:57.196 --> 20:59.397
I paid with Donny's cash.

21:00.765 --> 21:03.733
Don't go anywhere.
I'm gonna make a call.

21:03.768 --> 21:07.271
Don't worry.
We're gonna get this guy.

21:07.305 --> 21:08.938
Pete's alibi holds.

21:08.973 --> 21:10.507
He was sleeping it off

21:10.542 --> 21:12.776
At a friend's apartment
over in murray hill.

21:12.810 --> 21:15.445
It's weird that a guy who had
only $6.23 in his bank account

21:15.480 --> 21:18.182
Had enough cash on hand to peel
off a "g" like it was nothing.

21:18.216 --> 21:20.250
Not to mention all the repairs
he made to the bar.

21:20.285 --> 21:23.353
Maybe he was skimming, too.
If he was skimming that much,

21:23.388 --> 21:25.422
There'd have to be someone
he wasn't paying--

21:25.456 --> 21:28.425
A supplier, distributor? Why don't
you guys go back to the Old Haunt

21:28.459 --> 21:30.427
And take a look
at Donny's ledgers?

21:30.461 --> 21:33.162
Let's find out where that money
was coming from.

21:33.197 --> 21:34.664
Here you go, detective.

21:34.698 --> 21:36.265
Thank you.

21:36.300 --> 21:38.401
So C.S.U. Processed
that bar and basement,

21:38.435 --> 21:41.136
And there's no indication
of any broken red glass.

21:41.171 --> 21:44.039
And the only blood they found
was under the buckshot.

21:44.074 --> 21:45.708
So it wasn't
our murder scene.

21:45.742 --> 21:48.143
Well, looks like Donny
left that bar alive.

21:48.178 --> 21:50.145
you know, I don't get it.

21:50.180 --> 21:52.615
If Donny got shot down here,
and he didn't do anything wrong,

21:52.649 --> 21:54.617
Why didn't he report it?
The last thing

21:54.651 --> 21:57.119
Any new bar owner wants
is trouble with the cops.

21:57.153 --> 21:59.121
Even an accidental shooting
on the premises

21:59.155 --> 22:01.624
Could've cost Donny
his liquor license for good.

22:01.658 --> 22:04.593
Oh, probably why he shelled out for
Pete's truck damage, too. I don't see how.

22:04.627 --> 22:06.094
His personal account

22:06.128 --> 22:08.162
Isn't the only thing
that's tapped out.

22:08.197 --> 22:10.332
The Old Haunt
was barely breaking even,

22:10.366 --> 22:12.334
Operating at a loss most days.

22:12.368 --> 22:14.902
There's no way he was throwing
money around. Yet, he was.

22:14.937 --> 22:17.839
I've got invoices here--
one for the new brass rail

22:17.873 --> 22:19.841
And one for the new wood
for the bar,

22:19.875 --> 22:21.843
Each totaling
close to 6 grand.

22:21.877 --> 22:25.280
Both of 'em are stamped "petty cash.
Paid in full." Nothing petty about that.

22:25.314 --> 22:27.282
You sure
there's nothing in there

22:27.316 --> 22:29.284
About him winning the lotto?

22:29.318 --> 22:30.985
Actually...

22:31.019 --> 22:32.754
Maybe there is.

22:32.788 --> 22:34.488
a consignment receipt

22:34.522 --> 22:36.624
From Hagen and Graham
auction house?

22:36.658 --> 22:38.525
Why is a guy like Donny
doing business

22:38.560 --> 22:40.561
With a place that sells
picassos and rembrandts?

22:40.595 --> 22:42.563
His business
was barely breaking even.

22:42.597 --> 22:45.566
He was on the verge of losing
everything. And with his union card gone,

22:45.600 --> 22:48.835
It looks like he found something
else to sell. Yeah, but what?

22:48.870 --> 22:51.438
What does a dock worker have
that's valuable enough for

22:51.473 --> 22:53.540
A place like Hagen and Graham's
to be interested?

22:53.575 --> 22:55.576
Maybe something
that wasn't his.

22:55.610 --> 22:58.078
now here's a place
that honors history

22:58.112 --> 23:00.748
And values craftsmanship.

23:00.782 --> 23:03.584
You're pretty into this whole
preserving history stuff, huh?

23:03.618 --> 23:06.252
I think just lately, I've been
noticing the changes.

23:06.287 --> 23:08.220
You mean
in Alexis' goth friend?

23:08.255 --> 23:10.222
No, I was thinking
more along the lines

23:10.257 --> 23:11.724
Of times square.

23:11.759 --> 23:15.161
You know, once it had a real
New York grit and character.

23:15.195 --> 23:18.164
And now they should just
call it times square land.

23:18.198 --> 23:19.832
ahem.

23:19.866 --> 23:21.834
So sorry
to have kept you waiting.

23:21.868 --> 23:23.369
I'm steven Heisler,
associate director.

23:23.404 --> 23:26.339
I'm detective Kate Beckett.
This is Richard Castle. Mm.

23:26.373 --> 23:28.841
We were wondering

23:28.875 --> 23:31.377
If you recognize this man.
Oh, yes. Donald Hayes.

23:31.412 --> 23:34.113
We don't get many dock workers
here, as you might imagine.

23:34.147 --> 23:35.747
What's this about?

23:35.782 --> 23:39.250
He was murdered.
Murdered? Good lord.

23:39.285 --> 23:42.120
We understand that he put
an item up here for auction.

23:42.154 --> 23:44.222
We were wondering
what it was.

23:44.256 --> 23:45.200
Are you familiar with a man
by the name of Jimmy Walker?

23:45.240 --> 23:46.800
Sure. Everybody knows Jimmy Walker.

23:47.000 --> 23:49.861
No, not the actor who played
J.J. on "Good Times."

23:49.895 --> 23:52.597
No, the former Mayor
of New York.

23:52.632 --> 23:54.599
Took office 1926,

23:54.634 --> 23:57.101
Went by the nickname
"Beau James,"

23:57.136 --> 24:00.104
Famous for being a corrupt
politician, renowned womanizer,

24:00.139 --> 24:02.106
And also openly defiant
of prohibition.

24:02.141 --> 24:03.875
Ah. So you do know him.

24:03.909 --> 24:06.777
What does the former Mayor
have to do with this?

24:06.812 --> 24:08.779
Donald had an item
that once belonged to him.

24:08.814 --> 24:10.715
You see,
Mayor Walker was rumored

24:10.749 --> 24:14.051
To have had a private liquor
collection thought to contain

24:14.085 --> 24:16.887
One of the finest whiskeys ever distilled.
Unceremoniously dumped into the sewers

24:16.921 --> 24:19.390
When federal agents
ran Walker out of office.

24:19.424 --> 24:21.792
Donald came in with
the sole surviving bottle--

24:21.827 --> 24:24.628
An 1875 St. Miriam,
Rock od Scotland.

24:24.663 --> 24:26.630
I knew what it was
the moment I saw

24:26.665 --> 24:30.133
The "j.W."
pressed into its wax seal.

24:30.168 --> 24:33.136
An 1875 St. Miriam--that is
the holy grail of scotches.

24:33.171 --> 24:35.639
I would kill
for just a taste of that.

24:35.674 --> 24:38.007
Do you have a picture
of this bottle of scotch?

24:38.041 --> 24:40.142
where did Donny get it?

24:40.177 --> 24:42.278
Left to him
by his grandfather Leo,

24:42.312 --> 24:44.481
Who apparently was given it
as a gift

24:44.515 --> 24:47.316
When he returned from
world war ii.

24:47.351 --> 24:49.952
And there you have it.
Oh.

24:49.987 --> 24:51.921
And where is that bottle now?

24:51.955 --> 24:53.923
It was sold for $26,000

24:53.957 --> 24:56.659
To an internet millionaire
named Jeffrey McGuigan.

24:56.694 --> 24:58.194
A red glass bottle.

24:58.228 --> 25:00.530
At 26 grand...

25:00.564 --> 25:03.833
That is one
expensive murder weapon.

25:11.200 --> 25:13.668
How did you say
this guy made his millions?

25:13.702 --> 25:15.703
Internet gaming.
Owns about 50 sites.

25:15.738 --> 25:18.740
The guy spent 26k
on a bottle of whiskey.

25:18.774 --> 25:21.141
He could treat himself to
nicer digs.

25:21.176 --> 25:23.644
What's his motivation?
All I know is that

25:23.679 --> 25:26.881
This is about a body's throw
away from the river.

25:26.915 --> 25:29.083
<i>Speedy wok my ass.</i>

25:29.117 --> 25:30.752
You're not even speedy wok.

25:30.786 --> 25:32.754
We're here about a purchase
that was made

25:32.788 --> 25:34.255
At Hagen and Graham's.

25:34.289 --> 25:35.857
Is there
a Jeffrey McGuigan here?

25:35.891 --> 25:38.659
I go by Magoo.
It's my street name, you know?

25:38.694 --> 25:40.695
Seriously, you're
Jeffrey McGuigan? Magoo.

25:40.729 --> 25:42.697
And yeah, I've purchased
a ton of crap at that place.

25:42.731 --> 25:44.063
Come on in.

25:44.098 --> 25:46.199
<i>♪</i>

25:46.233 --> 25:50.236
so this piece of crap
we're looking for, Magoo,

25:50.271 --> 25:53.039
Is a priceless
red bottle of scotch.

25:53.073 --> 25:55.876
No, it had a price, all right.
But it was pretty tasty.

25:55.910 --> 25:57.911
Tasty?

25:57.945 --> 26:01.014
You describe a 135-year-old
bottle of scotch as "tasty"?

26:01.048 --> 26:03.583
I mean, you know, after I
mixed in a little root beer.

26:03.618 --> 26:05.585
Yeah, okay, Magoo,
let's see that bottle.

26:05.620 --> 26:08.422
Seriously? You're just gonna
walk into my crib

26:08.456 --> 26:11.000
And start bossing me around?
Well, I don't see it here.

26:11.001 --> 26:14.400
You didn't happen to... break
the bottle over... something?

26:14.895 --> 26:17.362
What is this about?
You know, I may have

26:17.397 --> 26:19.799
Dropped out of Cornell
when my company went public,

26:19.833 --> 26:22.301
But I still know my rights.

26:22.335 --> 26:24.303
That bottle
that you purchased

26:24.337 --> 26:26.472
Might have been used
to commit murder.

26:26.506 --> 26:29.174
So unless you want to learn
your miranda rights,

26:29.208 --> 26:32.311
You better quit stalling
and show us where it is.

26:32.345 --> 26:33.646
<i>♪</i>

26:33.680 --> 26:35.948
Yeah, okay, cool.
I'm not stalling.

26:35.982 --> 26:38.116
Great.
Yeah.

26:41.922 --> 26:43.989
You were throwing it out?

26:44.023 --> 26:46.223
In the blue bucket.
I recycle.

26:48.994 --> 26:51.262
Well, it's still intact.

26:51.296 --> 26:55.032
Unless a sliver of glass
came out when it hit--

26:55.067 --> 26:56.601
Man, nobody hit anybody.

26:56.635 --> 26:58.903
Yes, well, keep mixing
root beer with fine scotch,

26:58.938 --> 27:00.805
That may change...
Okay, Castle. Let's go.

27:00.840 --> 27:03.074
Just so you know.
Thank you.

27:03.108 --> 27:05.076
Cretinous little uncultured
palate doesn't deserve--

27:05.110 --> 27:07.078
Did you hear what he said?
Root beer.

27:07.112 --> 27:09.814
if I was 15 years
younger, I'd give that kid such a pinch.

27:09.849 --> 27:11.850
same glass,

27:11.884 --> 27:13.852
But the shard in Donny's head

27:13.886 --> 27:15.920
Is way too big to have come
from this bottle.

27:15.955 --> 27:17.420
Which means it can't be

27:17.455 --> 27:19.155
The only remaining bottle
in the world.

27:19.190 --> 27:20.958
Clearly not.

27:20.992 --> 27:23.961
Which means I still have
a shot at getting a taste.

27:23.995 --> 27:26.663
which means that Donny
came across a second bottle.

27:26.698 --> 27:29.600
Yeah, upside his head. Okay,
so maybe Leo gave a bottle

27:29.634 --> 27:31.602
To a relative or a friend,

27:31.636 --> 27:34.605
And once Donny learned how much
it was worth, he went after it.

27:34.639 --> 27:37.440
And got more
than he bargained for.

27:37.475 --> 27:39.442
I think I'm gonna do
a little research on Leo,

27:39.477 --> 27:41.444
See what we can dig up
on Mayor Walker

27:41.479 --> 27:42.946
And his mystery whiskey.

27:42.981 --> 27:45.015
Research.

27:45.049 --> 27:47.017
I'm gonna do that, too.

27:47.051 --> 27:48.618
Yeah.

out of the prohibition era... Mmm.

28:13.777 --> 28:16.746
A time when getting a drink
meant secret doors,

28:16.780 --> 28:18.414
Gangsters, and bootleggers.

28:18.448 --> 28:20.315
Ooh, Rick,
I'm loving this idea.

28:20.350 --> 28:22.817

<i>And she makes fun of everything

28:55.217 --> 28:57.752
I keep looking for the Gracie I knew,
but she's just not there anymore.

28:57.787 --> 29:00.755
Well, you're not the same girl
you were back then either.

29:00.790 --> 29:02.457

You have a glam gram,
and...

29:13.603 --> 29:16.537
Him, and a boyfriend.

29:16.572 --> 29:19.040
You know, did it ever
occur to you, that might be

29:19.075 --> 29:21.875
Rather intimidating to a
girl from kansas? Intimidated?

29:21.910 --> 29:23.877
When I asked
where she got her gloves,

29:23.912 --> 29:26.780
She said it was a place I wouldn't go
to. Now you took that as an affront,

29:26.815 --> 29:29.549
And she was just probably
being self-deprecating.

29:29.584 --> 29:32.052
Mm-hmm. You know what? I think
someone needs a virgin mojito.

29:32.087 --> 29:35.055
Go grab me some more mint.
It's in the fridge.

29:35.190 --> 29:37.424
here's
looking at you, kid. And you.

29:37.459 --> 29:39.292
Oh! Whoa!

29:39.327 --> 29:41.895
You coulda told me
you booby-trapped it.

29:41.930 --> 29:44.231
Oh, yes. Well, that's just
how I protect my stash

29:44.265 --> 29:45.799
From g-men and mobsters.

29:45.834 --> 29:48.002
Mm. At least help me
reload them.

29:48.036 --> 29:50.804
Right.

29:50.839 --> 29:52.304
Reload.

29:53.841 --> 29:55.307
reload.

29:55.342 --> 29:57.309
oh!

29:57.344 --> 30:01.080
Beckett, I think
I know how Donny was shot.

30:07.600 --> 30:10.668
Take a trip with me to
a simple yet dangerous time...

30:10.703 --> 30:13.171
Castle, C.S.U. Already swept
through this entire basement,

30:13.206 --> 30:15.673
And we were just tucked in
with my laptop.

30:15.708 --> 30:16.842
"we"?

30:16.876 --> 30:19.244
Josh and I.
He was helping me research.

30:19.278 --> 30:22.579
Anyway, a dangerous time
when prohibition was law

30:22.614 --> 30:24.314
And bootleggers the lawless,

30:24.349 --> 30:26.150
Often going
to extreme measures

30:26.184 --> 30:28.018
To protect
their liquid treasure.

30:28.053 --> 30:29.920
Can you get to the point?
Yes.

30:29.955 --> 30:31.922
You remember
when Donny jumped up

30:31.957 --> 30:33.924
And rescued Annie
from pick-up Pete?

30:33.959 --> 30:35.926
She said
she completely missed him

30:35.961 --> 30:38.362
When she was down here
doing her safe drop.

30:38.396 --> 30:40.397
It was late. She was tired.
I can relate.

30:40.431 --> 30:42.599
Or maybe
he wasn't down here at all.

30:42.634 --> 30:45.069
Buckshot wall...

30:45.103 --> 30:47.772
Wall directly opposite.

30:47.806 --> 30:49.606
Help me move the shelf.

30:49.641 --> 30:52.008
And what exactly
are we hoping to find?

30:52.042 --> 30:55.011
The truth. The same thing
Donny was hoping for.

30:55.045 --> 30:57.013
In all the stories
that Leo ever told,

30:57.047 --> 30:59.015
This bar historian,

30:59.049 --> 31:01.851
What if he saved one story
just for Donny?

31:01.886 --> 31:04.587
A story that Leo himself
could never verify

31:04.621 --> 31:07.090
Because the trapdoor to
the basement wasn't discovered

31:07.124 --> 31:08.591
Until after he died.

31:08.625 --> 31:10.593
When Billy Pitt decided
to sell the bar,

31:10.627 --> 31:12.595
And T.J. McChucklenuts
was going to buy it,

31:12.629 --> 31:15.598
Donny realized he had to
find out before it was too late.

31:15.632 --> 31:17.733
Find what?

31:17.768 --> 31:20.736
Donny sold his union card
and bet his life savings

31:20.771 --> 31:22.238
That Beau James--
come.

31:24.573 --> 31:26.041
Help me.

31:26.075 --> 31:27.542
there we go.

31:27.576 --> 31:31.646
That Beau James' secret stash
really existed.

31:31.681 --> 31:34.482
are you pushing?

31:34.517 --> 31:35.984
I am pushing!

31:40.824 --> 31:42.557
Okay.

31:42.591 --> 31:45.127
That's...

31:45.161 --> 31:47.429
Wow.

31:49.999 --> 31:52.367
Oh, Castle.

31:52.401 --> 31:55.402
This is where Donny was
when Annie made the drop.

31:57.272 --> 31:58.639
Oh-ho.

31:58.673 --> 32:01.309
Donny would've given
one pull on this door,

32:01.343 --> 32:03.177
And blam said the lady.

32:03.212 --> 32:05.313
do you hear that?

32:05.347 --> 32:06.814
Rushing water.

32:06.849 --> 32:08.816
If that water leads
to the East River,

32:08.851 --> 32:11.819
Then that's probably
where Donny was killed.

32:18.093 --> 32:20.427
What are you doing?

32:20.462 --> 32:23.630
We're gonna need a light,
right?

32:23.665 --> 32:25.465
not so fast, indy.

32:25.499 --> 32:28.902
We're also gonna need
breathable air, so...

32:34.242 --> 32:37.277
Torch would be more fun.

32:37.311 --> 32:40.247
This must be a part
of the old sewer system.

32:40.281 --> 32:42.249
Probably used these
as access tunnels

32:42.283 --> 32:43.750
During prohibition.

32:43.784 --> 32:45.285
It's incredible, isn't it?
Ooh.

32:45.319 --> 32:48.288
Yeah, aside from the fact
that it's...

32:48.322 --> 32:50.523
Damp, cramped, dark,

32:50.557 --> 32:53.293
And we are almost certainly
walking in rat poop.

32:53.327 --> 32:55.362
awesome.
Don't forget the c.H.U.D.S.

32:55.396 --> 32:56.862
c.H.U.D.S?

32:56.897 --> 32:58.697
Cannibalistic humanoid
underground dwellers.

32:58.731 --> 33:00.699
These sewers
are crawling with them.

33:00.733 --> 33:02.701
You know,
I kind of figured you more

33:02.735 --> 33:05.204
For an "alligator in the sewer"
type of guy.

33:05.238 --> 33:07.373
There's alligators
down here?

33:10.610 --> 33:14.079
What is this?

33:14.114 --> 33:15.680
Whoa.

33:15.715 --> 33:18.083
This looks like
an old passageway

33:18.118 --> 33:20.185
That was bricked up
a long time ago.

33:20.220 --> 33:22.654
Yeah, until Donny
got at it.

33:26.259 --> 33:28.726
Mayor Walker's moniker.

33:28.760 --> 33:32.030
"1919"--that's
when prohibition started.

33:32.064 --> 33:34.432
<i>Best time capsule ever.</i>

33:34.466 --> 33:37.601
imagine Donny's joy
when he realized

33:37.636 --> 33:39.837
That Leo's legends
were true.

33:39.871 --> 33:42.573
$26,000 a bottle--who cares
if Brian was skimming?

33:42.607 --> 33:44.242
There's gotta be

33:44.276 --> 33:47.045
A hundred bottles of scotch
on these walls.

33:47.079 --> 33:49.047
Take one down
and pass it around.

33:49.081 --> 33:51.049
Hey. That's evidence.

33:51.083 --> 33:54.385
And there's already a lot
that's been taken.

33:54.420 --> 33:56.887
It's fairly recently, too.

33:56.922 --> 33:59.056
These bottles
are caked with dust,

33:59.090 --> 34:01.992
And the empty spaces
are relatively clean.

34:03.527 --> 34:05.728
Here's our murder weapon.

34:05.763 --> 34:08.065
Hopefully
with some prints on it.

34:08.099 --> 34:10.632
There's probably blood
mixed in there, too...

34:10.668 --> 34:13.303
In case you were
thinking of tasting it.

34:13.338 --> 34:15.304
Come on.
I'm not that desperate.

34:15.340 --> 34:16.806
Mm-hmm. So someone else

34:16.841 --> 34:18.808
Finds out
about Donny's treasure,

34:18.842 --> 34:20.777
Follows him down here,

34:20.811 --> 34:22.779
Surprises him,
a fight breaks out,

34:22.813 --> 34:26.315
And the killer grabs
the only weapon available...

34:26.351 --> 34:28.217
Striking the fatal blow.

34:28.252 --> 34:30.552
And it looks like our killer

34:30.587 --> 34:34.023
Dragged the body
right back out the same way.

34:34.056 --> 34:37.293
Look at this,
all the way down.

34:37.327 --> 34:40.629
And then it travels
all the way...

34:40.663 --> 34:43.165
Ah, this tunnel
has everything--

34:43.199 --> 34:44.867
Secret scotch vault,

34:44.900 --> 34:46.534
Private murder nook,

34:46.569 --> 34:48.971
Convenient sewage disposal.

34:49.005 --> 34:52.174
I bet you this water
leads straight to the East River.

34:53.909 --> 34:55.378
This is fairly bright.

34:55.411 --> 34:58.314
Someone's been here
in the past few hours.

35:00.483 --> 35:02.450
Police! Don't move!

35:05.621 --> 35:08.656
stop! NYPD!

35:08.690 --> 35:11.459
This way. This way.

35:16.332 --> 35:17.932
Where did he go?

35:17.966 --> 35:20.935
He was right in front of us.
I heard him.

35:22.538 --> 35:24.506
This is a dead end.

35:24.540 --> 35:26.508
He couldn't
have gotten past us.

35:26.542 --> 35:29.010
There is no other way
he could've gotten out.

35:29.045 --> 35:32.279
So how did he get away?

35:40.200 --> 35:42.167
what do you mean, gone?

35:42.202 --> 35:44.169
He was right there
in front of us, and then...

35:44.204 --> 35:46.171
nothing but a brick wall.

35:46.206 --> 35:48.173
And there's no way this guy
could've gotten past you two

35:48.208 --> 35:50.309
And snuck out through the Old
Haunt? No, it was too narrow.

35:50.343 --> 35:52.311
Brian the bartender
and a handful of regulars

35:52.345 --> 35:53.812
Were still upstairs.

35:53.846 --> 35:56.248
They swear, no one came out
before we did.

35:56.283 --> 35:58.250
We think that
our spirit-loving Mayor

35:58.285 --> 36:00.252
Didn't want to be seen
going back and forth

36:00.287 --> 36:01.753
From his favorite speakeasy,

36:01.788 --> 36:04.223
So he had a back way entrance
built to his stash.

36:04.257 --> 36:06.358
Hidden from view,
and trust me, we looked.

36:06.393 --> 36:08.360
Yo, just got off the phone
with Lanie.

36:08.395 --> 36:11.363
She confirms the blood
on the broken bottle is Donny's.

36:11.398 --> 36:14.699
It's definitely our murder weapon. But we
run the prints, and we still came up empty.

36:14.734 --> 36:17.035
No matches to anyone at
the Old Haunt or in our system.

36:17.069 --> 36:19.037
It took 70 years
to find a way

36:19.071 --> 36:21.039
Down to those tunnels
from the Old Haunt,

36:21.073 --> 36:23.942
And somehow our killer
finds another way in? How?

36:23.976 --> 36:26.411
There's gotta be
another access point

36:26.446 --> 36:28.680
From the tunnel
to the East River sewer line.

36:28.714 --> 36:30.682
But the sewer bureau's map
doesn't have anything.

36:30.716 --> 36:33.051
It's like con ed doesn't even
know those tunnels exist.

36:33.085 --> 36:35.053
That's because
these are modern sewer lines.

36:35.087 --> 36:37.221
Any of the old sewer lines
that didn't get patched in

36:37.256 --> 36:39.223
When the new ones were built,

36:39.258 --> 36:41.893
They just got bricked up and abandoned.
That's like old subway lines. There are

36:41.928 --> 36:44.628
Whole stations underground no one's
seen for decades. So basically,

36:44.663 --> 36:46.630
We need to take a look
at an old sewer map,

36:46.665 --> 36:49.232
And once we figure out where
our killer disappeared to,

36:49.267 --> 36:53.704
We might be able to find some witnesses
on the other end. Then let's find that map.

36:53.738 --> 36:55.205
now...

36:55.239 --> 36:57.240
This place could use
a little gentrification,

36:57.275 --> 36:59.242
At the very least,
a copy machine.

36:59.277 --> 37:01.745
It's the pre-world war ii
archives section, Castle.

37:01.780 --> 37:05.415
Half of this probably hasn't
been seen in over 70 years.

37:05.450 --> 37:07.551
Lower east side, 1920.

37:07.586 --> 37:09.553
That's about when prohibition
was getting started.

37:09.588 --> 37:12.456
Aw, you see how much nicer
the neighborhood was back then?

37:12.491 --> 37:14.760
You think that little box there
might be the Old Haunt?

37:14.800 --> 37:15.761
Yeah, that's where it would be,

37:15.926 --> 37:17.894
Not long after
its bordello phase.

37:17.928 --> 37:20.964
You can still see the little garter belts.
Okay, there's a sewer line

37:20.998 --> 37:23.500
Running under it
that wasn't on the newer map,

37:23.534 --> 37:26.669
So that's gotta be our tunnel. Which would
put Walker's whiskey right about here.

37:26.704 --> 37:29.205
A man could grab himself
a bottle, come and go

37:29.239 --> 37:30.707
Without ever being seen.

37:30.741 --> 37:32.842
But come and go from where?
Where did he start from?

37:32.877 --> 37:35.011
Here's where our tunnel ends
and our killer vanished.

37:35.045 --> 37:37.947
There's one, two,
three sewer lines

37:37.982 --> 37:41.017
That branch off from that point. Any
of which our killer could've accessed

37:41.051 --> 37:42.519
To get away from us.

37:42.553 --> 37:44.520
So if we can figure out

37:44.554 --> 37:46.522
Exactly where
the three sewers end,

37:46.556 --> 37:48.289
We can subpoena traffic cams

37:48.324 --> 37:50.291
Around the time
the killer got away,

37:50.326 --> 37:51.793
Maybe get an I.D.

37:51.828 --> 37:53.996
Or maybe we won't need
any of that.

37:54.030 --> 37:55.998
You said no one
has laid eyes on these maps

37:56.032 --> 37:57.666
In over 70 years,

37:57.700 --> 37:59.167
Only it says here,

37:59.201 --> 38:01.703
Someone checked this one out
just two weeks ago.

38:01.738 --> 38:03.705
And I'll bet a bottle
of Beau James' whiskey

38:03.740 --> 38:06.041
That someone was trying
to make their way

38:06.075 --> 38:09.678
Back to the Mayor's stash,
just like we are.

38:09.712 --> 38:12.380
Going once, going twice...

38:12.415 --> 38:14.816
sold to the
gentleman in the back.

38:14.851 --> 38:19.053
Next up, we have a marvelous
1955 Chateau Restivo blanc,

38:19.087 --> 38:21.722
And we'll start the bidding
at $1,200.

38:21.757 --> 38:23.390
Do I hear $1,200?

38:23.425 --> 38:26.126
There's $1,200.
Do I hear $1,250?

38:26.161 --> 38:28.462
$1,250 there.
$1,300?

38:28.496 --> 38:29.864
13--

38:32.333 --> 38:35.169
$1,300 in the back.

38:35.203 --> 38:38.005
Do I hear $1,350?

38:38.040 --> 38:39.373
$1,350...

38:42.210 --> 38:45.312
$1,350...

38:45.346 --> 38:47.814
Oh.

38:47.848 --> 38:50.383
Do I hear...

38:50.417 --> 38:52.285
14--

38:55.856 --> 38:59.025
it's just a sad case
of Donny trusting the wrong guy.

38:59.060 --> 39:01.027
He told Heisler
about the Beau James' stash,

39:01.062 --> 39:03.529
And Heisler got greedy.
He convinced Donny

39:03.564 --> 39:05.531
That the whiskey
would fetch a better price

39:05.566 --> 39:07.533
If he sold it
a bottle at a time,

39:07.568 --> 39:10.036
So Donny left the stash where he
found it. And that gave Heisler

39:10.071 --> 39:13.106
Enough time to figure out where it was
hidden. When Donny caught him in the vault,

39:13.140 --> 39:16.109
Heisler panicked, hit him with
a bottle. Yo. We figured out

39:16.143 --> 39:19.444
How Heisler disappeared on you
in the tunnel. Secret passageway.

39:19.479 --> 39:21.614
Basically.

39:21.648 --> 39:23.515
He had a hidden entrance
that could only be opened

39:23.549 --> 39:25.517
From the other side.
Now C.S.U. Followed it

39:25.551 --> 39:28.286
From the street to the abandoned
sewer to the tunnel,

39:28.321 --> 39:30.623
Just like Mayor Walker had drew it
up. here's, uh, three cases

39:30.657 --> 39:33.125
That Heisler hadn't gotten
around to selling yet.

39:34.327 --> 39:35.894
At 26 g's a pop,

39:35.929 --> 39:38.296
You're looking at just under
a cool million.

39:38.331 --> 39:41.366
I just--how might I acquire
one of these for myself?

39:41.400 --> 39:43.435
Castle, I told you,
they're evidence.

39:43.469 --> 39:45.437
Yes, but who's to say
that today's evidence

39:45.471 --> 39:47.572
Can't be tomorrow's nightcap?
That would be me.

39:47.607 --> 39:50.474
I'm sure it'll be a few months
before we can figure out

39:50.509 --> 39:53.544
Where this and the rest of this stuff
belongs.

39:53.578 --> 39:56.047
Montgomery. Yeah.

39:56.081 --> 39:58.750
Look at you.

39:58.784 --> 40:01.052
Isn't it cool?
Gracie took me shopping

40:01.086 --> 40:03.121
In this place
I never even knew existed,

40:03.155 --> 40:05.123
And it's right down
the street from here.

40:05.157 --> 40:08.126
They had the greatest stuff.
She has a really good eye.

40:08.160 --> 40:11.228
Well, Alexis looks good in everything.
I'm glad you two reconnected.

40:11.263 --> 40:13.230
We just had to get to know
the new uses.

40:13.265 --> 40:15.066
Neither of us are 10 anymore.

40:15.100 --> 40:17.568
Thanks for letting me crash
at chez Castle.

40:17.602 --> 40:19.637
It reminded me
of the good ol' days

40:19.671 --> 40:21.805
Before life got too real,
you know?

40:21.839 --> 40:23.406
I do know.

40:23.440 --> 40:26.009
I'm gonna walk her
to the train.

40:26.044 --> 40:27.310
Bye.
Mm.

40:27.344 --> 40:28.812
Gram's waiting downstairs.

40:28.846 --> 40:31.581
Thanks for the warning.

40:31.615 --> 40:34.617
Wow. I remember that phase.

40:34.652 --> 40:37.253
That's about
when I got my tattoo.

40:37.288 --> 40:40.323
You've got a tattoo?
Well, on--

40:40.357 --> 40:42.258
I... Where?

40:42.293 --> 40:43.994
Just heard from
the D.A., Castle.

40:44.028 --> 40:45.929
Apparently since
all of these bottles

40:45.963 --> 40:48.431
Used to belong to Beau James,
and he used to be our Mayor,

40:48.465 --> 40:50.800
It's her opinion that
they're owned by the city.

40:50.834 --> 40:54.036
But she says if you're willing
to make a generous donation

40:54.071 --> 40:55.805
To the NYPD
widows and orphans' fund,

40:55.839 --> 40:59.675
You can have one of Beau James'
best for your very own.

40:59.710 --> 41:01.677
This is early Christmas,
baby.

41:01.712 --> 41:03.112
I... May...

41:03.146 --> 41:05.181
I was not expecting this.

41:05.215 --> 41:07.850
Are you crying?
Yes.

41:07.884 --> 41:10.686
I don't know what to say.
Try "let me get my checkbook."

41:10.721 --> 41:13.388
yes,
of course. Of course. But I...

41:13.423 --> 41:16.058
I will only accept this
if you all share it with me.

41:16.093 --> 41:18.327
Twist my arm.
No.

41:18.361 --> 41:20.763
Not here.
Um, at the Old Haunt.

41:20.797 --> 41:22.831
We will toast to Donny
with his family.

41:22.865 --> 41:24.600
Yeah, well, what ab--
what about that place?

41:24.640 --> 41:26.760
What happens to the Old Haunt? It's gonna
go back to the bank, which means that

41:26.800 --> 41:28.640
T.J. McChucklenuts is gonna
get another shot at it.

41:28.680 --> 41:30.800
Oh, I wouldn't worry
about the Old Haunt.

41:32.041 --> 41:34.308
You bought it, didn't you?

41:34.343 --> 41:36.811
So are you joining us?

41:36.846 --> 41:38.546
You know, I'd love to.

41:38.580 --> 41:41.049
It's late, and I've got
a lot of paperwork.

41:41.083 --> 41:43.084
It's 9:00 on a Saturday.

41:43.119 --> 41:44.753
