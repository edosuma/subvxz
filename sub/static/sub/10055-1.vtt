01:03.008 --> 01:06.803
[Woman] Do you know
the expression ''a man's man'' ?

01:06.886 --> 01:09.972
A man's man
is the leader of the pack.

01:10.056 --> 01:14.977
The kind of man other men
look up to, admire and emulate.

01:16.395 --> 01:18.939
A man's man
is the kind of man who...

01:19.022 --> 01:22.567
[Chuckles] just doesn 't get
what women are about.

01:22.651 --> 01:28.072
Nick, my ex-husband,
is the ultimate man's man.

01:28.156 --> 01:30.074
I probably never
should have married him.

01:30.157 --> 01:32.159
I don't think he understood
a thing about me.

01:32.243 --> 01:35.454
So, this is Nick Marshall's office.
Wanna peek ?

01:35.537 --> 01:37.498
Don't worry.
He never gets in before 10:00.

01:37.539 --> 01:40.375
He'll send you on more errands than
anyone in the entire company...

01:40.459 --> 01:42.377
'cause he can't do
anything for himself.

01:42.460 --> 01:46.381
He's the least politically
correct guy in the universe.

01:46.464 --> 01:48.716
He's the king of all
the T & A ads we do.

01:48.800 --> 01:50.968
You want babes in bikinis ?
He's your man.

01:51.052 --> 01:54.597
My dad ? How can I
best describe him ?

01:54.680 --> 01:57.724
He's always been...
like an uncle to me.

01:57.808 --> 01:59.976
Yeah, Uncle Dad.

02:00.018 --> 02:03.229
Although,
Nick was a charmer.

02:03.313 --> 02:06.482
Completely irresistible
at first,

02:06.524 --> 02:10.318
which feeds into
the whole ''man's man'' thing.

02:10.360 --> 02:13.322
You know about
Nick's mother, right ?

02:13.364 --> 02:17.117
Because once you understand
about Nick's mother,

02:17.201 --> 02:19.494
you understand Nick.

02:22.539 --> 02:27.126
[Woman] Nick was actually
born and raised in Las Vegas.

02:27.210 --> 02:32.256
Nick's mother was a real,
honest-to-God Las Vegas showgirl.

02:32.339 --> 02:37.094
When otherboys were outside
riding their bikes and playing ball,

02:37.177 --> 02:41.515
Nick was backstage
hanging with the girls.

02:41.556 --> 02:45.226
He was their mascot,
their little pet.

02:45.310 --> 02:49.230
They couldn 't get enough
of those baby blues.

02:49.313 --> 02:51.232
- Bang ! Bang !
- [ Laughs ]

02:53.442 --> 02:56.695
lf you ask me, I'd say Nick's
mother just about killed it...

02:56.737 --> 02:59.031
for every woman
Nick would ever meet.

02:59.114 --> 03:02.200
She had a lot of sugardaddies
in her life,

03:02.284 --> 03:05.078
but only one true love--

03:05.161 --> 03:07.914
the boy
with the family jewels.

03:09.290 --> 03:11.959
17, 18, 19, 20.
Let me see that, kid.

03:12.043 --> 03:13.961
And since Nick
didn 't have a father,

03:14.044 --> 03:18.590
his mom made sure he was always
surrounded by strong role models.

03:18.674 --> 03:20.592
- Come here, huh ?
- [ Screams ]

03:20.675 --> 03:23.345
- Men her boy could look up to.
- Now you're ready, huh ?

03:24.929 --> 03:26.848
Keep countin', kid.

03:26.931 --> 03:29.600
There was nothing normal about
the way Nick Marshall was raised.

03:31.102 --> 03:33.687
So, what can you expect ?

03:33.771 --> 03:36.023
You don't have to be Freud
to figure out...

03:36.106 --> 03:39.234
this was one cockeyed way
to enter the world.

04:00.295 --> 04:05.091
[ Groaning ]

04:11.722 --> 04:13.641
Oh !

04:15.309 --> 04:16.810
Don't you ever knock ?

04:18.185 --> 04:20.439
It's almost 10:00. You gotta go
to work, and I gotta vacuum in here.

04:20.522 --> 04:23.274
And don't forget - Another one
who wears vanilla perfume.

04:23.358 --> 04:26.444
Don't you know any women
who don't want to smell like candy ?

04:26.527 --> 04:29.155
- Toss me my lighter, babe ?
- Babe ?

04:29.197 --> 04:31.365
What am I,
a little pig ?

04:31.449 --> 04:33.576
I don't have time
to make you no onion bagel,

04:33.659 --> 04:35.577
so please do not start
to beg, okay ?

04:35.661 --> 04:39.206
And for the record, l don't like
finding these things in your sofa.

04:39.289 --> 04:41.708
What kind of woman
wears underwear like this ?

04:41.750 --> 04:44.044
Hey, my mother wore
underwear like that.

04:44.085 --> 04:46.212
Just put them somewhere,
will you, babe ?

04:46.296 --> 04:49.340
Well, ''babe'' is gonna put it
in the trash where it belongs.

04:49.382 --> 04:51.342
- So, your mother should excuse me.
- [ Sighs ]

04:51.384 --> 04:53.552
Did you ever consider dating
a woman who wears real underwear?

04:53.636 --> 04:57.055
The kind that covers the entire
bottom the way it's supposed to ?

04:57.139 --> 04:59.975
- No. But if I do, should I call ?
- Oh !

05:01.226 --> 05:03.853
I'm gonna go clean
the kitchen.

05:03.895 --> 05:05.855
You couldn't toast me
a little bagel, could you ?

05:05.897 --> 05:08.232
Light cream cheese, tomatoes.
Capers if we have any.

05:08.316 --> 05:11.193
Please! Come on.
l can't think on an empty stomach.

05:11.235 --> 05:14.530
Okay. Allright. But only because
you didn 't call me that pig name.

05:14.571 --> 05:16.573
Okay, you got it, babe.

05:23.246 --> 05:25.665
Mr. Marshall,
how are you doing today ?

05:25.748 --> 05:28.126
- I'm fit as a dancing bear.
- I'll get that cab for you.

05:28.209 --> 05:30.962
- [ Whistles ]
- That's some set of pipes you got.

05:31.045 --> 05:34.882
- You have an excellent day, sir.
- And you.

05:37.509 --> 05:40.345
At ease.

05:54.608 --> 05:57.027
- [ Gasps ]
- Oh, oh, I'm so sorry !

05:57.110 --> 05:58.987
I absolutely
did not mean to do that.

05:59.071 --> 06:00.989
- Here. Let me get that for you.
- It's okay.

06:01.072 --> 06:03.158
No, I'm mortified.
I can see your hands are full.

06:03.241 --> 06:05.451
- Thank you.
- Sorry. Let me get the door.

06:05.535 --> 06:07.453
[ Grunts ]

06:07.537 --> 06:09.455
- [ Giggles ] Thank you.
- Thank you.

06:09.539 --> 06:12.083
Halfcup, grande, nonfat,
thick foam, wet cap, no lid.

06:12.166 --> 06:15.252
''Halfcaff,'' grande, nonfat,
thick foam, wet cap, no lid.

06:15.294 --> 06:17.796
- So, when do you find out ?
- Um, today, I think.

06:17.880 --> 06:22.467
Unless I didn't get it, and then
I will just never find out.

06:22.550 --> 06:24.969
I'm sure I didn't get it. They were
looking for an ''earth mother'' type.

06:25.011 --> 06:27.805
I overheard the director
say I was more space cadet.

06:27.889 --> 06:30.308
I'm an actress.
I can be whatever you want.

06:30.391 --> 06:32.810
- Is that true, can you ?
- Oh, better be true.

06:32.852 --> 06:35.646
Otherwise, I'm stuck playing ditsy
coffee girl the rest of my life.

06:35.729 --> 06:38.857
Thank you.
Hon ? Thanks.

06:38.941 --> 06:43.153
Oh ! Hi, Nick. Hi.

06:43.236 --> 06:46.364
Oh, Lola, my love. When are you
gonna let me buy you dinner ?

06:46.447 --> 06:48.991
Nick, I don't know why you don't
believe me. I'm not your type.

06:49.075 --> 06:52.328
Trust me on this one. Cappuccino,
extra foam. Tall or grande ?

06:52.411 --> 06:55.372
Grande. Or at least
I like to think so.

06:55.456 --> 06:57.457
- Next.
- You know, rumor has it...

06:57.541 --> 07:00.001
I'm getting some really
big news at work today.

07:00.085 --> 07:02.921
At least come out with me.
Celebrate. I'll buy you a coffee.

07:03.004 --> 07:05.298
Memo to you:
I work in a coffee shop.

07:05.340 --> 07:07.300
Hi. What can I get you ?

07:07.342 --> 07:09.510
- Hi. I'll take--
- Want me to stop asking you out ?

07:09.594 --> 07:11.512
Sorry. This will
just take a sec.

07:11.595 --> 07:14.431
Because, Lola,
give me the word and I'll stop.

07:14.515 --> 07:18.060
Yes, I'm gonna give you the word
because I'm an actress.

07:18.143 --> 07:21.479
Or at least I'm trying to be one.
I'm trying to concentrate on that.

07:21.521 --> 07:24.649
So, you know, it would be
a good thing, if you wouldn't mind,

07:24.691 --> 07:26.651
to stop asking me out !

07:27.819 --> 07:29.946
Honey, you seem
so stressed.

07:30.029 --> 07:32.156
I am stressed.
I have a lot on my plate.

07:32.239 --> 07:34.199
So, let's not talk
about this now.

07:34.241 --> 07:36.535
Why don't I meet you here,
say, tomorrow ? 1 0:00 ? 1 0:30 ?

07:36.618 --> 07:38.620
- Okay, that would be good.
- So, that's a date ?

07:38.704 --> 07:41.998
It's a date.
Thank you.

07:42.040 --> 07:44.751
Sir,
that was inspiring.

07:44.834 --> 07:46.753
I know.

07:48.463 --> 07:50.381
[Woman]
Good morning, Sloane-Curtis.

07:50.464 --> 07:52.383
- Good morning, Mr. Marshall.
- Hi, honey.

07:52.466 --> 07:54.385
- What's the dirt ?
- I was at breakfast this morning--

07:54.468 --> 07:56.470
- Hey, Norm ! You winning ?
- Of course.

07:56.553 --> 07:59.389
I heard Miller's shopping around,
looking for a new agency.

07:59.431 --> 08:01.391
Miller Lite. I know.
I'm all over it.

08:01.433 --> 08:04.727
Also, I heard Darcy McGuire left
B.B.D. & O. Good morning, Angela.

08:04.811 --> 08:06.729
-You're kidding. Left or was fired ?
-I don't know.

08:06.813 --> 08:08.773
Everyone there
is thrilled to get rid of her.

08:08.856 --> 08:12.026
Well, so much for
edgy female vision.

08:12.068 --> 08:14.361
So, that girl we met
last night at the club,

08:14.403 --> 08:16.655
nothing happened after
you put her in the cab, right ?

08:16.738 --> 08:18.949
It did ?
Something happened ?

08:19.032 --> 08:21.034
But she said she had to
be in bed early.

08:21.117 --> 08:23.828
I had her in bed by 11:00.
Or was it quarter to ?

08:23.912 --> 08:25.830
You - You're like a genius,
you know that ?

08:25.914 --> 08:29.542
What can I tell you, buddy ? I'm
blessed. And today is my lucky day.

08:29.625 --> 08:33.712
Not only is my ex-wife remarrying--
right now, as a matter of fact--

08:33.796 --> 08:36.381
but Wanamaker called me himself,
wanted to see me first thing.

08:36.465 --> 08:39.051
- Called twice to confirm.
- Call me when he makes it official.

08:39.092 --> 08:43.013
It's not gonna be as easy to suck up
to ''creative director,'' you know.

08:43.096 --> 08:46.182
Not to worry. I'll make us a lunch
rez at the Drake to celebrate.

08:46.266 --> 08:49.602
Don't count your chickens,
huh ? 1:00 ?

08:49.685 --> 08:51.812
Pick you up.

08:51.896 --> 08:53.814
Can I borrow this ?

08:59.611 --> 09:01.613
- Hey, Dina.
- Hi.

09:01.696 --> 09:03.948
Do you know the difference
between a wife and a job ?

09:03.990 --> 09:06.284
- What is it ?
- After ten years, job still sucks.

09:06.326 --> 09:08.494
- [ Laughing ]
- That's a good one, huh ?

09:08.578 --> 09:11.789
I wouldn't do that if I were you.
That's not a good idea, no.

09:13.040 --> 09:14.959
- Oh, Mr. Marshall, hi.
- Hey.

09:15.042 --> 09:17.794
I put the storyboards on your desk.
Picked up your shoes from Barney's.

09:17.878 --> 09:19.796
Got your glasses fixed.
There was no charge.

09:19.880 --> 09:21.798
This morning's staff meeting
was cancelled.

09:21.882 --> 09:23.800
And I got your cigarettes.
They're next to your laptop.

09:23.883 --> 09:25.843
This morning's staff meeting
was cancelled.

09:25.927 --> 09:28.596
- That's what I was told.
- Hmm.

09:28.638 --> 09:32.725
Good morning, girls.
[ Chuckling ]

09:32.808 --> 09:35.019
Good afternoon, sire.

09:35.102 --> 09:38.063
Hey, anybody know why
the staff meeting was cancelled ?

09:38.146 --> 09:40.065
Nobody called us.

09:40.148 --> 09:42.942
Oh, but Mr. Wanamaker wants
to see you as soon as you get in,

09:42.984 --> 09:46.279
which I told his office
was 15 minutes ago.

09:46.321 --> 09:48.364
- I know.
- You couldn't show up on time ?

09:48.448 --> 09:51.575
You know you're being promoted.
But you look very sharp, by the way.

09:51.659 --> 09:53.577
- Thank you.
- Like a creative director.

09:53.661 --> 09:55.954
- Very distinguished.
- [ Exhales Deeply ]

09:55.996 --> 09:59.249
You able to handle yourselves
on the 44th floor ? Be truthful.

09:59.333 --> 10:01.710
Are you kidding ?
We were made for the 44th floor.

10:01.793 --> 10:04.796
Now, get up there already,
so we can break out the bubbly.

10:04.838 --> 10:07.256
- Don't wait up.
- [ Both ] Don't wait up.

10:07.340 --> 10:10.009
- He's so adorable.
- He says the cutest things.

10:12.511 --> 10:14.471
Boy.

10:16.265 --> 10:19.643
Sorry, buddy. I was in the board
meeting that would never end.

10:19.685 --> 10:21.895
- Have you been here long ?
- A couple minutes. That's all.

10:21.978 --> 10:24.314
Jess, can I get a cup of decaf
and a couple Tylenol?

10:24.355 --> 10:27.275
And see if we got any Echinacea.
And I need some club soda.

10:27.358 --> 10:31.487
I got something on my tie.
Know what ?Just get me another tie.

10:31.529 --> 10:35.824
I saw the mock-ups you did for
Johnny Walker. They're fantastic.

10:35.866 --> 10:38.118
Oh, that's my job, Dan.

10:38.201 --> 10:40.537
So, you know l'm not great
at making speeches,

10:40.620 --> 10:43.623
especially when I haven't
got you to write them for me.

10:43.707 --> 10:47.210
So, I'll do my best. I've been
in this racket over 30 years.

10:47.293 --> 10:49.337
Let me tell you something,
it doesn't get any easier.

10:49.420 --> 10:52.173
As a matter of fact,
it gets harder and harder.

10:52.214 --> 10:54.174
The '80s
were our glory days.

10:54.216 --> 10:57.261
They were all about
alcohol, tobacco and cars.

10:57.344 --> 10:59.846
I felt like
I was on top of my game.

10:59.888 --> 11:03.892
And then in the '90s, men stopped
dominating how dollars were spent,

11:03.975 --> 11:05.935
and we lost our compass.

11:06.019 --> 11:11.065
Women between 16 and 24 are
the fastest-growing consumer group.

11:11.148 --> 11:15.235
Girls who were born in the mid-'80s
control our advertising dollars.

11:15.319 --> 11:18.155
Sorry. No Echinacea.
Hi, Nick.

11:18.238 --> 11:20.782
- Hey.
- Red or lavender?

11:20.866 --> 11:23.660
Red. No, no, lavender.
That'sgood.

11:23.743 --> 11:27.413
Lavender's good. While we've been
shooting beer commercials...

11:27.497 --> 11:31.000
with the Swedish bikini team,
the industry has been transformed.

11:31.083 --> 11:33.919
We were the agency in town
ten years ago.

11:34.003 --> 11:36.797
Now we're struggling
to be third.

11:36.880 --> 11:39.883
lf we don't evolve and think
beyond our naturalability,

11:39.925 --> 11:42.510
we're gonna go down.

11:42.594 --> 11:46.431
''Think beyond our natural -''
I'm not quite clear what you mean.

11:46.514 --> 11:48.891
What do you know
about Darcy McGuire ?

11:48.933 --> 11:51.852
Oh, hey, l heard on the whisper
she just left B.B.D. & O.

11:51.936 --> 11:55.064
I never met the woman, but
I hear she's a real man-eater.

11:55.105 --> 11:57.691
She won that Cleo last year we
should have won for the add about--

11:57.774 --> 12:00.735
Oh, yeah, right.
That was her ? I forgot about that.

And what I learned there
was that any success I had...

53:25.329 --> 53:28.040
Yeah, they are.

53:28.123 --> 53:30.083
Wow. It's
a beautiful collection.

53:30.125 --> 53:32.877
- Thanks. So how's it going ?
- Mmm.

53:32.961 --> 53:35.088
You know, I was gonna
ask you the same thing.

53:35.171 --> 53:37.715
It's starting slow.

53:37.799 --> 53:40.551
- I'm evaluating staff, that's hard.
- Oh, yeah.

53:40.634 --> 53:42.595
Yeah, right.

53:51.269 --> 53:53.897
Well, you know, I don't
wanna beat around the bush.

- He's proposing so soon ?

53:57.442 --> 53:59.902
- Oh, sorry. Sorry. [ Chuckles ]
- Oh !

53:59.986 --> 54:02.571
- Uh, yes--
- Excuse me.

- You got another one. Wow !
- [Darcy] Thanks.

[ Chuckling ]
As I was saying,

54:07.951 --> 54:11.621
I know nothing about the products
you're going for personally,

54:11.705 --> 54:14.249
but I do believe
I can sell anything...

54:14.332 --> 54:16.959
once I know
what the buyer's needs are.

54:17.043 --> 54:19.545
And what I'd really like,
with your kind indulgence of course,

54:19.629 --> 54:21.881
is to go after
that really big fish.

54:21.964 --> 54:23.966
I mean, the one
you really wanna land.

54:24.049 --> 54:25.968
I'll learn what I need to know,
and I'll reel them in for us.

54:26.051 --> 54:28.887
No, actually, I think
l'll reel them in for us.

54:28.970 --> 54:31.848
That is, unless you're going after
something in particular yourself.

54:31.932 --> 54:34.851
No. It's just that there're several
big fish out there at the moment.

54:34.934 --> 54:37.395
Oh, yeah ?
Well, what's your biggest fish ?

54:37.478 --> 54:40.439
To your mind,
who's your whale ?

54:40.523 --> 54:42.983
Um, Nike--
women's division ?

54:43.025 --> 54:45.319
You heard
they were shopping ?

54:45.360 --> 54:47.404
I got wind of it.

54:47.487 --> 54:50.282
- Amazing. I heard no one knew.
- You knew.

54:50.323 --> 54:54.327
- I heard no one else knew.
- It's okay if I know what you know.

54:54.410 --> 54:56.496
- We're on the same team. Besides,
- Yeah.

54:56.579 --> 54:58.623
I heard someone say once
two heads are better than one--

54:58.664 --> 55:02.126
- Oh, you were listening.
- More than you know.

55:02.209 --> 55:04.962
Okay,
here's what I heard.

55:05.045 --> 55:07.547
Nike is shopping,
quietly.

55:07.631 --> 55:10.300
But if they make a change,
it's gonna happen fast.

55:10.383 --> 55:12.594
Now, you know this is
a tough one for us to get.

55:12.677 --> 55:15.179
It would be a tough one for anybody
to get, but if we got it--

55:15.263 --> 55:17.473
- That's all we'd need.
- I hear you.

exactly ?

- I'm sorry.

- That won't work.
- No, okay. I'm sorry.

- I understand. Go on.
- They wanna get in women's heads...

55:34.072 --> 55:36.658
and reach them
on a very real level.

55:36.699 --> 55:40.328
Don't take this wrong, but you got
jumpy talking about lipstick.

55:40.369 --> 55:44.832
- I know.
- Nike is hard-core woman power.

go after this one ?

- Sure.

55:57.051 --> 56:00.137
I want you to look at these boards
for U.S. Air before they come by.

56:00.221 --> 56:03.349
- Right.
- lt feels like something's missing.

56:03.390 --> 56:05.392
Hmm. I don't like
the graphics.

56:05.434 --> 56:07.644
Feels a bit parochial.

56:07.728 --> 56:09.646
Maybe it should be
in black and white.

56:09.729 --> 56:13.525
- What do you think, Nick ?
- I don't know who you've had,

56:13.566 --> 56:16.110
but, I don't know,
it seems kind of--

56:16.194 --> 56:18.571
What's the word ?
Parochial to me.

56:18.613 --> 56:20.906
Um, what do you think,
Darcy ?

56:20.948 --> 56:23.701
I totally agree,
especially about the graphics.

56:23.784 --> 56:26.328
They're parochial.
It's so funny you just said that.

56:26.411 --> 56:28.330
Yeah ?

56:28.413 --> 56:31.625
Why don't you get them to
try it in black and white ?

56:31.708 --> 56:33.668
Might punch it up
a little.

56:34.794 --> 56:36.879
What ?
Did you say something ?

56:38.422 --> 56:42.259
No. I just swear I was
thinking the exact same thing.

Were you ?

56:46.388 --> 56:49.015

Good idea, Nick.

56:49.099 --> 56:51.268
Good idea, Nick ?
Speak up. Quick.

56:51.351 --> 56:53.395
- Say something before he leaves.
- Uh, Dan ?

56:53.478 --> 56:57.899
Want me to look at the boards ? Once
they have a stab, give me a buzz.

56:57.940 --> 57:00.067
- I will. Thanks, buddy.
- Dan ?

57:00.109 --> 57:03.612
ln case they find Nick's idea
too retro, which they might--

57:03.696 --> 57:06.240
-Oh, yeah.
-they may think it's old-fashioned--

57:06.323 --> 57:10.619
I'd be ready with some--
maybe a dot com kind of thing ?

57:10.702 --> 57:14.789
Maybe there's something about
getting on-line at the airport.

57:14.873 --> 57:17.083
No, I think we're fine, really.
Really, we're good.

57:17.166 --> 57:19.710

Yeah. But she digs him,
and he's invited her to the prom.

- You know that, right ? Oh, yeah.
- Is it ?

go into all that ? He needs to go.

01:28:44.188 --> 01:28:46.106
Just a few... hours.

01:28:46.190 --> 01:28:49.109
Nick, you said that
you wouldn't hurt me.

01:28:49.151 --> 01:28:51.903
And then you slept with me, and then
you didn't call me for six days.

01:28:51.945 --> 01:28:55.698
So that, in the world of me,
that's torture.

01:28:55.782 --> 01:28:59.243
I mean, we have this totally
unbelievable, life-altering sex,

01:28:59.327 --> 01:29:01.287
and then
you just disappear.

01:29:01.328 --> 01:29:03.289
I mean, you-you-you
stopped drinking coffee !

01:29:03.372 --> 01:29:06.291
Lola, I'm so sorry.

01:29:06.375 --> 01:29:08.877
It's okay.

01:29:08.960 --> 01:29:11.087
It's okay, because
I figured out your little secret.

01:29:11.129 --> 01:29:13.756
- You did ?
- It's so obvious.

01:29:13.840 --> 01:29:15.800
How else would you know
the things that you know ?

01:29:15.842 --> 01:29:19.470
- It wasn't obvious to anybody else.
- Nick, come on.

01:29:19.553 --> 01:29:22.973
You're so sensitive.
You're so aware of my feelings.

01:29:23.057 --> 01:29:25.851
You're so tuned in.

01:29:25.934 --> 01:29:28.395
You talk to me like a woman,
you think like a woman.

01:29:28.478 --> 01:29:32.399
Nick ! Come on ! Admit it.
You're totally and completely gay.

01:29:33.608 --> 01:29:36.027
- I am ?
- You're not ?

01:29:36.110 --> 01:29:39.155
Oh ! I mean, if you're not,
you gotta tell me.

01:29:39.238 --> 01:29:42.283
Based on the other night--
Just put me out of my misery.

01:29:42.324 --> 01:29:44.284
Are you or aren't you ?

01:29:44.326 --> 01:29:46.995
Say you're gay. Then l'm not nuts.
l'm not undesirable.

01:29:47.079 --> 01:29:51.333
Not rejected by another guy !
Say it ! Say you're gay ! Admit it !

01:29:51.416 --> 01:29:52.792
Okay.

01:30:00.633 --> 01:30:02.551
I'm gay.

01:30:04.678 --> 01:30:07.139
How gay ?

01:30:07.180 --> 01:30:10.475
Oh !
I'm as gay as it gets.

01:30:14.354 --> 01:30:16.731
You're gonna make some guy
very happy someday.

01:30:16.814 --> 01:30:19.483
Oh, from your lips.

01:30:21.360 --> 01:30:23.988
God, I hate that
I'm crying.

01:30:24.071 --> 01:30:27.282
Well, look it.

01:30:27.366 --> 01:30:29.493
If things should ever change
in that department--

01:30:29.576 --> 01:30:31.995
- You'll be the first to know.
- You promise ?

01:30:32.037 --> 01:30:35.331
Oh, yeah, I promise.
Come here.

01:30:50.971 --> 01:30:52.889
Oh, boy.

01:30:57.518 --> 01:30:59.645
-It was very nice meeting you, Nick.
-And you.

01:30:59.729 --> 01:31:01.856
Thanks for pep talk, yes ?

01:31:01.939 --> 01:31:03.899
You two just
take care of each other.

01:31:03.941 --> 01:31:05.901
- And thanks for the yarmulke.
- Oh, no problem.

01:31:05.943 --> 01:31:08.737
- You wear it well, yes ?
- Happy trails, kids.

01:31:08.820 --> 01:31:11.698
- Isn't he great ?
- Darcy !

01:31:14.409 --> 01:31:17.161
I need to talk to you.

01:31:17.245 --> 01:31:21.165
Uh-oh, look at him.
I knew it. He is weird about it.

01:31:21.248 --> 01:31:24.585
This is not about last night.
It's about the Nike meeting.

01:31:24.668 --> 01:31:27.129
And I honestly believe
in my gut...

01:31:27.212 --> 01:31:29.339
- that you should make the pitch.
- Oh, God.

01:31:29.422 --> 01:31:31.424
-I guilted you into this last night.
-No, no.

01:31:31.508 --> 01:31:33.551
- It would be better if you did it.
- No, no, no.

01:31:33.593 --> 01:31:35.762
This is your baby.
You've gotta do it.

01:31:35.845 --> 01:31:37.930
I gotta go meet and greet
these folks. I'll see you in there.

01:31:39.265 --> 01:31:42.226
- It's not my baby.
- Yes, it is.

01:31:47.439 --> 01:31:51.401
I predict no one will even know I'm
gone until the files start to build.

01:31:51.443 --> 01:31:53.778
It could be days.

01:31:56.030 --> 01:31:57.949
And then someone
will finally ask,

01:31:58.032 --> 01:32:00.076
''Where's the geek in the glasses
who carries all the files ?''

01:32:05.414 --> 01:32:08.750
Do either of you two know what
the story is on this Erin girl ?

01:32:08.792 --> 01:32:11.002
- Miss Lonely Hearts ? Who knows ?
- Yeah.

01:32:11.086 --> 01:32:13.546
Ooh, I know.
She's been here two years.

01:32:13.630 --> 01:32:16.090
She tried to be a copywriter
but got turned down.

01:32:16.132 --> 01:32:19.135
- So she got stuck as a messenger.
- What fool turned her down ?

01:32:19.218 --> 01:32:22.096
You did, sire.

01:32:22.137 --> 01:32:25.432
Well, did I ever
meet with her at least ?

01:32:25.516 --> 01:32:28.268
I don't think so. As I recall,
you told me to ''blow her off.''

01:32:28.351 --> 01:32:30.437
Well, I wanna meet
with her now.

01:32:30.478 --> 01:32:32.522
The kid's got something.
She's kind of funny.

01:32:32.605 --> 01:32:35.858
This is your lucky day. I just saw
the Nike group get off the elevator.

01:32:35.942 --> 01:32:38.694
All women. Your specialty.
Come on. I'll walk you up.

01:32:38.778 --> 01:32:41.113
I hate what I'm doing to Darcy.
I hate it !

01:32:41.197 --> 01:32:43.157
I'm gonna write her
a long letter, confess everything.

01:32:43.198 --> 01:32:45.159
- You're doing Darcy ? Since when ?
- No !

01:32:45.200 --> 01:32:47.160
I said I hate what
I'm doing to Darcy.

01:32:47.202 --> 01:32:49.162
- Men are stupider. It's true.
- Will you stop it ?

01:32:49.246 --> 01:32:52.248
- They are.
- ''They'' ? Are you a woman now ?

01:32:52.332 --> 01:32:55.001
Oh, I wish. A woman wouldn't have
screwed over the woman she loved.

01:32:55.084 --> 01:32:57.503
No, they don't think that way.
And another thing.

01:32:57.545 --> 01:32:59.588
- This thing about penis envy.
- Yeah.

01:32:59.672 --> 01:33:01.632
Not true. No.
They don't envy it.

01:33:01.674 --> 01:33:03.634
Half of'em
don't even like it.

01:33:03.676 --> 01:33:05.636
You know who has
penis envy ? We do.

01:33:05.677 --> 01:33:07.638
That's why we cheat
and screw up and lie,

01:33:07.679 --> 01:33:09.681
because we're all obsessed
with our own equipment.

01:33:09.723 --> 01:33:11.683
- You ready ? Okay.
- Yeah.

01:33:11.766 --> 01:33:13.685
Thanks.

01:33:16.062 --> 01:33:18.481
[Nick] You don't stand in front
of a mirror before a run...

01:33:18.522 --> 01:33:21.901
and wonder what the road
will think of your outfit.

01:33:21.984 --> 01:33:26.196
You don't have to listen to its
jokes and pretend they're funny.

01:33:27.656 --> 01:33:30.659
lt would not be easier to run
if you dressed sexier.

01:33:30.700 --> 01:33:33.703
The road doesn't notice
if you're not wearing lipstick.

01:33:33.786 --> 01:33:36.164
lt does not care
how old you are.

01:33:36.205 --> 01:33:38.165
You do not feel
uncomfortable...

01:33:38.207 --> 01:33:40.167
because you make more money
than the road.

01:33:41.544 --> 01:33:44.338
And you can call on the road
whenever you feel like it,

01:33:44.380 --> 01:33:46.548
whether it's been a day...

01:33:46.632 --> 01:33:48.925
or even a couple of hours
since your last date.

01:33:51.094 --> 01:33:53.847
The only thing
the road cares about...

01:33:53.888 --> 01:33:55.848
is that you pay it a visit
once in a while.

01:33:57.016 --> 01:33:59.685
Nike.
No games.

01:33:59.769 --> 01:34:01.437

Why are you not the happiest guy
in Chicago right now ?

01:35:00.741 --> 01:35:02.701
You just did so great.

01:35:02.785 --> 01:35:05.037
No, no, I didn't do so great.
We did so--

01:35:05.120 --> 01:35:08.498
No, actually,
you did so great.

01:35:08.582 --> 01:35:10.500
- You.
- You, me.

01:35:10.584 --> 01:35:12.919
We did great !

01:35:13.002 --> 01:35:16.589
Will you come with me someplace ?
I wanna show you something.

01:35:16.672 --> 01:35:19.133
- I have something I need to finish.
- Please ?

01:35:20.760 --> 01:35:22.094
Please.

Okay.
Here you go.

01:35:38.776 --> 01:35:40.736
- Come with me.
- All right.

01:35:40.778 --> 01:35:43.906
-Should I close my eyes or anything?
-No.

01:35:43.989 --> 01:35:48.035
So, you see those top

01:36:16.853 --> 01:36:18.854
living room.

01:36:18.938 --> 01:36:20.856
It's beautiful.

01:36:48.048 --> 01:36:50.008
What are you thinking ?

01:36:52.177 --> 01:36:55.054
You've got that look
you have sometimes.

01:36:56.514 --> 01:36:59.809
Yeah ? No. I was just wondering
when you get to move in.

01:36:59.892 --> 01:37:02.311
Well, they said
two weeks, so--

01:37:02.394 --> 01:37:05.731
Okay.
This is the dining room.

01:37:08.316 --> 01:37:10.986
- The fireplace works. Come here.
- Wow.

01:37:12.487 --> 01:37:15.573
I can see elegant parties in here.
Waiters with caviar,

01:37:15.657 --> 01:37:18.284
- you in a beautiful gown.
- You can see all that ?

01:37:18.367 --> 01:37:22.037
Maybe you're naked and I'm the only
guest, but it'd still be elegant.

01:37:22.121 --> 01:37:24.248
Okay.
So this is upstairs.

Uh, right... here.

He'll be there. Bye. I gotta
talk to you too. That was Nike.

that we won the account.

I gotta hand it to you. You saved

01:39:42.750 --> 01:39:45.711
Actually, Dan, I had very little
to do with saving anybody's ass.

It's Darcy you should be thanking,
that's what I want to talk about.

01:39:48.422 --> 01:39:51.883

The girl didn't open her mouth.

to admit when I screw up.

and I panicked.

Nick, forgive me.
I want you to step in here.

No, no, no, no. Dan, you did
the right thing when you hired her.

Please. Look.

And I've decided...
I need to take a leave of absence.

- Hey, calm down. I can't do that.
- Why ?

01:40:54.065 --> 01:40:57.485
Because I talked to the board and I
told them I don't need her anymore.

01:40:57.568 --> 01:40:59.695
- Oh !
- They offered her a settlement.

01:40:59.737 --> 01:41:02.406

01:57:06.456 --> 01:57:08.583
Can't afford to keep it.
I don't have a job.

01:57:08.667 --> 01:57:12.170
You know, you ought to try
returning some of your phone calls.

01:57:12.253 --> 01:57:15.006
- You got your job back.
- Oh, do I ?

01:57:15.089 --> 01:57:17.592
- You're a riot. You know that ?
- lt's true.

01:57:17.675 --> 01:57:19.677
Dan told me so himself.

01:57:19.760 --> 01:57:22.972
Why would he tell you that ? I
didn't do the job he hired me to do.

01:57:23.055 --> 01:57:25.015
Even I don't blame him
for firing me.

01:57:25.057 --> 01:57:28.310
Look, I'm, uh--
You can come on in.

01:57:28.351 --> 01:57:30.353
I don't have any chairs,
but if you wanna--

01:57:30.437 --> 01:57:32.480
What if I told you that...

01:57:32.564 --> 01:57:34.607
you did everything
that you were hired to do--

01:57:34.691 --> 01:57:38.945
everything-- but that
someone was sabotaging you ?

01:57:40.321 --> 01:57:44.158
Picking your brain,
swiping your ideas and--

01:57:44.199 --> 01:57:48.453
Well, you-- you never
even knew what hit you.

01:57:48.537 --> 01:57:51.915
- How is that possible ?
- Oh, trust me, it's possible.

01:57:51.998 --> 01:57:53.833
Well, who would do
such an awful thing ?

01:57:57.044 --> 01:57:59.463
I would.

01:58:02.549 --> 01:58:04.760
I was a dope
with a corner office.

01:58:04.843 --> 01:58:09.222
And when you came with the job
I was supposed to have,

01:58:09.306 --> 01:58:13.017
I mean, it didn't matter
to me that...

01:58:13.059 --> 01:58:16.437
you were better at it than me
or you earned it more than I did.

01:58:16.521 --> 01:58:21.400
As far as I was concerned, it was
mine, and I was gonna get it back.

01:58:21.442 --> 01:58:25.404
So I took advantage of you
in the worst possible way.

01:58:28.990 --> 01:58:30.909
Have you ever done that ?

01:58:30.992 --> 01:58:34.537
Taken the wrong road and--
No, of course you haven't.

01:58:34.621 --> 01:58:38.040
You wouldn't do that.
That's just--

01:58:38.082 --> 01:58:40.292
Somebody like me does that.

01:58:40.376 --> 01:58:43.087
And, uh--

01:58:43.170 --> 01:58:47.090
The problem with that was that while
I was digging the hole under you...

01:58:49.467 --> 01:58:51.553
I found out
all about you.

01:58:51.594 --> 01:58:53.555
And the more I found out...

01:58:54.681 --> 01:58:56.599
the more you dazzled me.

01:58:58.684 --> 01:59:02.896
I mean, shook my world,
changed my life, dazzled me.

01:59:04.940 --> 01:59:08.026
And guys like that ex-husband
of yours, he made you feel that...

01:59:09.194 --> 01:59:12.697
the price you pay
just for being you...

01:59:12.781 --> 01:59:14.907
is that you don't get
to have love.

01:59:14.949 --> 01:59:17.493
Isn't that what you were
trying to say the other night ?

01:59:17.577 --> 01:59:22.414
That you weren't complete ?
That you weren't really a winner ?

01:59:23.791 --> 01:59:25.751
Everything about you--

01:59:25.792 --> 01:59:29.087
how smart you are,
how good you are--

01:59:29.171 --> 01:59:32.257
everything just makes me
want you even more.

01:59:37.094 --> 01:59:39.847
Oh, wow.
Boy.

01:59:39.930 --> 01:59:42.016
So it looks like I'm here
at 1:00 in the morning...

01:59:42.099 --> 01:59:46.019
being all heroic
trying to rescue you,

01:59:46.103 --> 01:59:48.772
but the truth is...

01:59:48.814 --> 01:59:51.232
I'm the one that needs
to be rescued here.

01:59:58.656 --> 02:00:00.658
I sure wish
I could read your mind.

02:00:08.165 --> 02:00:11.793
Well, I was thinking that, um,

02:00:11.835 --> 02:00:15.963
if everything you're saying
is true,

02:00:16.005 --> 02:00:18.132
if I really have
my job back...

02:00:24.096 --> 02:00:26.014
then I think you're fired.

02:00:30.852 --> 02:00:33.938
Well, I never-- I never really
thought about it from that angle.

02:00:37.108 --> 02:00:40.986
Well, not that
I don't deserve it. I-do-do--

02:00:41.028 --> 02:00:42.988
I'm stuttering.

02:00:56.542 --> 02:00:58.669
Now I feel kind of, uh,

02:00:58.753 --> 02:01:01.505
embarrassed that I told you
I needed to be rescued.

02:01:02.715 --> 02:01:05.425
But that's-that's fine.

02:01:19.522 --> 02:01:22.024
That's it ?

02:01:27.237 --> 02:01:29.406
I don't want that to be it.

02:01:29.489 --> 02:01:31.700
I don't want that
to be it at all.

02:01:31.783 --> 02:01:36.037
Then don't let a little thing like
me firing you stand in your way.

02:01:40.374 --> 02:01:43.919
I didn't know
what to react to first.

02:01:44.002 --> 02:01:46.046
Hey, news flash.

02:01:46.088 --> 02:01:48.048
I took the wrong road.

02:01:50.091 --> 02:01:52.594
What kind of knight
in shining armor would I be...

02:01:52.677 --> 02:01:55.680
if the man I love
needs rescuing...

02:01:55.763 --> 02:01:58.349
and I just let him
walk out my door ?

02:02:06.481 --> 02:02:08.442
My hero.

02:03:38.943 --> 02:06:31.843
