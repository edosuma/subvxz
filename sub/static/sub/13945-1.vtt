WINNER, GOLDEN LION

00:41.417 --> 00:45.002
VENICE FILM FESTIVAL 1961

01:49.067 --> 01:54.822
LAST YEAR AT MARIENBAD

01:57.284 --> 01:59.535
...silent rooms

01:59.912 --> 02:03.623
where one's footsteps are absorbed
by carpets so thick, so heavy,

02:04.082 --> 02:06.918
that no sound reaches one's ear,

02:07.044 --> 02:08.544
as if the very ear

02:08.920 --> 02:13.883
of him who walks on once again
along these corridors,

02:14.259 --> 02:18.095
through these salons and galleries,
in this edifice of a bygone era,

02:18.263 --> 02:21.641
this sprawling, sumptuous,
baroque, gloomy hotel,

02:21.767 --> 02:24.560
where one endless corridor
follows another,

02:25.395 --> 02:27.271
silent, empty corridors

02:27.397 --> 02:30.733
heavy with cold, dark woodwork,

02:31.151 --> 02:32.735
stucco, molded paneling,

02:32.861 --> 02:34.612
marble, black mirrors,

02:34.780 --> 02:36.906
dark-toned portraits, columns,

02:38.116 --> 02:41.536
sculpted doorframes,
rows of doorways,

02:41.662 --> 02:45.206
galleries, side corridors

02:45.332 --> 02:48.334
that in turn lead to empty salons,

02:48.460 --> 02:52.421
salons heavy
with ornamentation of a bygone era...

03:18.156 --> 03:21.617
...as if the ground
were still sand or gravel

03:21.743 --> 03:23.369
or flagstones

03:23.495 --> 03:26.664
over which I walked once again

03:27.708 --> 03:31.752
along these corridors,
through these salons and galleries,

03:31.879 --> 03:34.338
in this edifice

03:34.506 --> 03:37.258
of a bygone era,
this sprawling, sumptuous,

03:37.384 --> 03:40.011
baroque, gloomy hotel,

03:40.178 --> 03:43.347
where one endless corridor
follows another...

04:09.291 --> 04:11.000
...silent rooms

04:11.126 --> 04:13.377
where one's footsteps are absorbed

04:13.545 --> 04:15.880
by carpets so thick, so heavy,

04:16.048 --> 04:19.175
that no sound reaches one's ear,

04:19.301 --> 04:21.928
as if the very ear
of him who walks on

04:22.053 --> 04:25.181
once again along these corridors,

04:26.350 --> 04:29.060
through these salons
and galleries,

04:29.186 --> 04:31.896
in this edifice of a bygone era...

04:51.708 --> 04:55.628
...sculpted doorframes,
rows of doorways,

04:55.754 --> 04:59.006
galleries, side corridors

04:59.132 --> 05:02.051
that in turn lead to empty salons

05:02.177 --> 05:05.930
heavy with ornamentation
of a bygone era,

05:06.098 --> 05:07.264
silent rooms,

05:07.432 --> 05:10.351
where one's footsteps are absorbed

05:10.477 --> 05:13.020
by carpets so thick, so heavy,

05:13.146 --> 05:15.815
that no sound reaches one's ear,

05:16.608 --> 05:19.318
as if the very ear...

05:35.335 --> 05:36.794
...flagstones

05:36.920 --> 05:40.006
over which I walked once again,

05:40.966 --> 05:45.052
along these corridors,
through these salons and galleries,

05:45.178 --> 05:48.389
in this edifice of a bygone era,

05:48.515 --> 05:52.810
this sprawling, sumptuous,
baroque, gloomy hotel,

05:52.936 --> 05:55.938
where one endless corridor
follows another,

05:56.314 --> 05:58.315
silent and deserted,

05:58.442 --> 06:01.277
heavy with cold, dark woodwork,

06:01.403 --> 06:03.988
stucco, molded paneling,

06:04.156 --> 06:06.240
marble, black mirrors,

06:06.366 --> 06:08.784
dark-toned portraits, columns,

06:09.745 --> 06:12.747
sculpted doorframes,
rows of doorways,

06:12.873 --> 06:14.373
galleries,

06:15.167 --> 06:19.378
side corridors that in turn lead
to empty salons,

06:19.504 --> 06:23.132
salons heavy
with ornamentation of a bygone era...

07:02.089 --> 07:04.340
...dark-toned portraits,
columns,

07:05.383 --> 07:08.803
sculpted doorframes,
rows of doorways,

07:08.929 --> 07:12.098
galleries, side corridors

07:12.224 --> 07:15.226
that in turn lead to empty salons,

07:15.352 --> 07:18.729
salons heavy with ornamentation
of a bygone era...

07:20.232 --> 07:23.734
silent rooms where
one's footsteps are absorbed

07:23.860 --> 07:26.278
by carpets so thick, so heavy,

07:26.404 --> 07:30.032
that no sound reaches one's ear,

07:30.158 --> 07:32.743
as if one's very ear
were far away,

07:32.911 --> 07:35.246
far from the ground,
from the carpet,

07:35.413 --> 07:37.748
far from this heavy,
empty setting,

07:37.874 --> 07:41.335
far from this complex frieze
running just beneath the ceiling,

07:41.461 --> 07:43.629
with its branches and garlands,

07:43.755 --> 07:45.756
like ancient leaves,

07:45.882 --> 07:48.968
as if the ground were still
sand or gravel

07:49.094 --> 07:50.761
or flagstones,

07:50.887 --> 07:54.056
over which I walked once again

07:54.182 --> 07:56.267
as if in search of you,

07:56.393 --> 07:59.186
between these walls laden
with woodwork,

07:59.312 --> 08:03.357
stucco, moldings, paintings,

08:03.483 --> 08:06.735
framed prints past which I strode,

08:08.071 --> 08:10.906
among which even then

08:11.032 --> 08:15.327
I was waiting for you,

08:15.871 --> 08:19.415
far from this setting
in which I now find myself

08:20.125 --> 08:22.001
standing before you,

08:22.127 --> 08:26.714
waiting for the man
who will not be coming now,

08:26.965 --> 08:29.258
who is not likely to come now

08:29.801 --> 08:32.135
to part us again,

08:32.804 --> 08:35.389
to tear you away from me.

08:36.640 --> 08:38.142
Will you come?

08:38.476 --> 08:41.854
We must wait a little.
A few minutes more.

08:41.980 --> 08:44.356
Just a few minutes.
A few seconds.

08:44.482 --> 08:46.233
A few seconds more,

08:46.359 --> 08:50.362
as if you still hesitated
to part with him, with yourself,

08:50.488 --> 08:53.991
as if his silhouette, now gray,
might still reappear,

08:54.117 --> 08:57.286
here where you had
imagined him too insistently,

08:57.412 --> 08:59.788
too fearfully, or too hopefully,

08:59.915 --> 09:02.374
for fear of losing this bond -

09:02.500 --> 09:06.795
No, that hope is now fruitless.

09:06.922 --> 09:09.715
Gone is the fear
of losing that bond,

09:09.841 --> 09:12.384
that confinement, that falsehood.

09:12.510 --> 09:16.347
That entire story is now over.
It is ending.

09:16.473 --> 09:19.391
A few seconds more
and it will solidify -

09:19.517 --> 09:22.478
Forever, in a past of marble,

09:22.604 --> 09:25.481
like these statues,
this garden carved out of stone,

09:25.607 --> 09:28.943
this very hotel
with its now-deserted rooms,

09:29.069 --> 09:31.654
these frozen, silent figures,

09:31.780 --> 09:33.864
long dead no doubt,

09:34.032 --> 09:36.367
which still guard the corridors

09:36.534 --> 09:39.495
down which
I walked toward you,

09:39.621 --> 09:41.830
between two rows of faces,

09:41.957 --> 09:45.960
forever inert, frozen,
watchful, indifferent,

09:46.086 --> 09:48.504
toward you,
perhaps still hesitant,

09:48.630 --> 09:52.091
as you continue to watch
the threshold of this garden.

09:55.387 --> 09:57.054
There.

09:59.516 --> 10:01.308
And now...

10:03.561 --> 10:05.729
I am yours.

10:36.928 --> 10:41.098
I don't quite remember.
It was in '28 or '29.

10:49.941 --> 10:52.318
Really? How amazing.

10:53.820 --> 10:56.322
We've met before.

11:35.528 --> 11:39.198
Connection? There's absolutely
no connection, my friend.

11:39.324 --> 11:43.827
The fact that he or she could say
or do certain things to suggest...

11:45.830 --> 11:47.998
And an impossible climate!

11:48.124 --> 11:50.626
You're stuck indoors for months,
and suddenly,

11:50.752 --> 11:53.504
when you least expect it...

11:56.257 --> 11:57.841
You saw it yourself?

11:58.009 --> 11:59.885
No, I heard about it
from a friend.

12:00.011 --> 12:03.055
Ah, so you only heard about it.

12:18.446 --> 12:20.823
The others? What others?

12:20.949 --> 12:22.866
Forget what they think.

12:23.034 --> 12:23.909
But you know -

12:24.035 --> 12:26.870
You claimed
you'd listen only to me.

12:31.376 --> 12:32.543
I'm listening.

12:32.710 --> 12:35.963
Then listen to my grievance.
Enough of this role,

12:36.089 --> 12:40.259
this silence, these walls,
these whispers you've made my prison.

12:40.385 --> 12:42.386
Lower your voice, please.

12:42.554 --> 12:46.265
These silences to which
you confine me are worse than death.

12:46.391 --> 12:50.727
These days we spend here
side by side are worse than death.

12:50.895 --> 12:53.272
We're like coffins
buried side by side

12:53.398 --> 12:55.274
in a frozen garden.

12:55.400 --> 12:56.942
Be quiet.

12:57.861 --> 13:00.112
A garden of reassuring order,

13:00.238 --> 13:03.073
with clipped hedges
and geometric paths,

13:03.199 --> 13:06.952
where we stroll with measured steps,
side by side, day after day,

13:07.078 --> 13:09.913
at arm's length, never closer...

13:10.039 --> 13:11.748
Be quiet.

13:18.506 --> 13:20.340
It's truly incredible.

13:23.761 --> 13:25.387
I don't quite remember.

13:26.306 --> 13:28.765
It must have been in '28.

13:29.309 --> 13:31.768
In '28 or '29.

13:31.936 --> 13:36.356
In the summer of 1929,
we had freezing weather for a week.

13:41.154 --> 13:42.946
A very beautiful woman.

13:45.366 --> 13:47.576
But an overactive imagination.

14:08.264 --> 14:10.057
This intolerable silence,
these walls,

14:10.183 --> 14:13.310
these whispers worse than the silence
you've made my prison.

14:13.436 --> 14:15.812
These days here side by side,

14:15.980 --> 14:17.981
walking along these corridors
with measured steps,

14:18.107 --> 14:20.734
at arm's length, never closer,

14:20.860 --> 14:24.154
never reaching out
with fingers or lips.

14:24.280 --> 14:25.280
Be quiet.

14:25.406 --> 14:28.534
These fingers made to hold
and eyes made to see you,

14:28.660 --> 14:30.577
which must turn from you

14:30.703 --> 14:33.413
toward this ornamentation
of a bygone era:

14:33.540 --> 14:35.499
woodwork, cut-glass mirrors,

14:35.625 --> 14:37.501
old-fashioned paintings,

14:37.669 --> 14:39.336
stucco garlands
with baroque ornaments,

14:39.504 --> 14:41.547
trompe-l'Å“il capitals,

14:41.673 --> 14:44.633
false doors, fake columns,
painted perspectives,

14:44.759 --> 14:46.802
false exits.

14:47.762 --> 14:48.804
Extraordinary!

14:48.930 --> 14:51.515
Not as extraordinary as all that.

14:51.641 --> 14:53.809
He was behind it all.

14:53.935 --> 14:55.852
He knew all the outcomes
in advance.

14:55.979 --> 14:57.187
That explains it.

14:57.313 --> 14:59.523
Still, it was impressive.

15:00.900 --> 15:03.485
Feathery wings like a swan's.

15:04.070 --> 15:07.489
- You haven't been here long?
- No, but I've been here before.

15:07.615 --> 15:10.200
- So you like it here?
- Not really.

15:10.326 --> 15:13.203
It was just chance.
We always come back here.

15:13.329 --> 15:15.998
- Father was up for a position...
- I see.

15:16.124 --> 15:17.082
in the area.

15:17.208 --> 15:18.917
Influence peddling.

15:19.043 --> 15:21.545
A shoe with a broken heel.

15:22.964 --> 15:25.591
From which there is no escape?

15:25.842 --> 15:28.719
From which there is no escape.

15:30.013 --> 15:32.139
Don't you know the story?

15:32.265 --> 15:34.850
It was all the talk last year.

15:34.976 --> 15:39.688
Frank said he'd come
as her father's friend to chaperone her.

15:39.814 --> 15:42.733
Strange chaperone, he was!

15:42.859 --> 15:44.985
She realized it a bit late,

15:45.111 --> 15:48.989
the night he tried to get into her room
as if by accident,

15:49.115 --> 15:53.577
on an absurd pretense:
to explain a painting to her...

15:53.745 --> 15:57.164
The fact he has a German passport
doesn't prove much.

15:57.290 --> 16:01.460
But his presence here
has no connection, my friend.

16:13.306 --> 16:16.600
Not now.
I suggest another game.

16:16.768 --> 16:18.935
I know a game I always win.

16:19.062 --> 16:22.439
If you can't lose, that's no game.

16:22.565 --> 16:24.316
I can lose...

16:24.442 --> 16:26.318
but I always win.

16:27.445 --> 16:28.862
Let's try it.

16:29.280 --> 16:31.406
It's for two players.

16:31.532 --> 16:34.951
The cards are laid out like this.

16:40.333 --> 16:41.750
Seven.

16:44.962 --> 16:46.338
Five.

16:49.133 --> 16:50.634
Three.

16:52.595 --> 16:54.012
One.

16:55.682 --> 16:58.850
Each player takes cards in turn,

16:58.976 --> 17:00.727
as many as he wants,

17:00.853 --> 17:03.772
but only from one row each time.

17:03.898 --> 17:07.983
Whoever picks up
the last card loses.

17:09.028 --> 17:10.904
Would you like to begin?

17:39.267 --> 17:41.184
You're the same as ever.

17:41.352 --> 17:44.146
As if I last saw you
only yesterday.

17:44.272 --> 17:46.356
What's become of you
in all this time?

17:46.482 --> 17:49.735
Nothing,
since I'm the same as ever.

17:50.528 --> 17:51.528
Not married?

17:52.780 --> 17:54.364
Try it. It's fun.

17:54.532 --> 17:56.283
- I like my freedom.
- Here?

17:56.743 --> 17:59.453
- Why not here?
- It's a strange place.

17:59.579 --> 18:01.371
You mean, to be free?

18:01.497 --> 18:03.373
Especially that.

18:03.541 --> 18:05.625
You're the same as ever.

18:07.295 --> 18:09.004
You're the same as ever.

18:32.695 --> 18:35.572
But you hardly seem
to remember.

18:41.412 --> 18:44.289
Yet you recognize
these baroque ornaments,

18:44.415 --> 18:47.250
this stucco hand holding
a cluster of grapes.

18:47.376 --> 18:50.921
Behind the hand you see foliage,
like living foliage,

18:51.047 --> 18:53.590
in a garden awaiting us.

18:55.009 --> 18:57.010
You never noticed all that?

18:57.136 --> 18:59.930
I never had such a good guide.

19:00.306 --> 19:04.267
You know the proverb:
"Said the compass to the ship..."

19:06.229 --> 19:08.688
There's much more to see here.

19:09.607 --> 19:10.816
If you please.

19:10.942 --> 19:12.692
With pleasure.

19:13.861 --> 19:16.613
Does this hotel
have so many secrets?

19:16.781 --> 19:18.448
A vast amount.

19:19.867 --> 19:22.160
What a mysterious air.

19:29.627 --> 19:32.295
Why are you looking
at me like that?

19:37.385 --> 19:40.178
You hardly seem
to remember me.

20:24.682 --> 20:26.850
The first time I saw you

20:27.018 --> 20:29.728
was in the gardens
at Frederiksbad.

20:29.854 --> 20:32.522
You were alone,
apart from the others,

20:32.690 --> 20:34.941
standing against
a stone balustrade

20:35.067 --> 20:39.529
on which you rested your hand,
with your arm half-extended.

20:40.114 --> 20:43.241
You were turned slightly
towards the central path,

20:43.367 --> 20:45.785
and you didn't see me coming.

20:45.912 --> 20:50.498
The sound of my steps on the gravel
finally caught your attention,

20:51.208 --> 20:53.376
and you turned your head.

20:54.378 --> 20:58.381
I doubt it was me.
You must be mistaken.

20:59.884 --> 21:00.926
Try to remember.

21:03.721 --> 21:06.556
We were near
a group of stone figures

21:07.475 --> 21:10.143
on a fairly high pedestal.

21:10.269 --> 21:13.271
A man and a woman
in classical dress.

21:13.397 --> 21:18.193
Their frozen gestures seemed
to dramatize some specific scene.

21:19.528 --> 21:22.280
You asked me
who the figures were.

21:22.406 --> 21:25.158
I said I didn't know.

21:26.077 --> 21:29.037
You took a few guesses,
but I said

21:29.163 --> 21:32.248
they could just as well
be you and me.

21:32.416 --> 21:34.834
Then you began to laugh.

21:36.921 --> 21:38.421
I love that.

21:39.298 --> 21:41.424
Even then...

21:41.550 --> 21:43.760
I loved the sound of your laugh.

21:47.598 --> 21:50.475
The others around us came over.

21:50.893 --> 21:53.687
Someone identified the statues.

21:54.146 --> 21:56.439
They were mythological figures:

21:56.565 --> 22:00.110
gods or heroes
of ancient Greece.

22:00.236 --> 22:04.781
Or maybe it was an allegory,
something like that.

22:05.408 --> 22:07.367
You'd stopped listening.

22:07.493 --> 22:10.078
You seemed far away.

22:10.788 --> 22:14.666
Your look had grown
serious and vacant again.

22:15.710 --> 22:17.585
You turned away slightly

22:17.712 --> 22:20.714
to look down
the central path again.

22:24.552 --> 22:28.179
One, two, three, four,

22:28.305 --> 22:31.224
five, six, seven.

22:32.226 --> 22:34.978
One, two, three,

22:35.146 --> 22:37.355
four, five.

22:37.773 --> 22:38.773
One...

22:38.899 --> 22:41.693
two, three.

22:42.236 --> 22:43.445
One.

22:43.571 --> 22:47.699
And once again
we were separated.

23:17.897 --> 23:19.481
Impossible!

23:23.861 --> 23:26.654
Let's go for a stroll
in the gardens.

23:26.781 --> 23:28.364
Frank isn't here yet.

23:28.491 --> 23:32.535
You know the proverb:
"Said the compass to the ship..."

23:58.562 --> 24:01.356
What if you go first?

24:07.696 --> 24:10.573
And once again I walked on,

24:11.408 --> 24:12.700
alone,

24:13.035 --> 24:15.370
down these same corridors,

24:15.496 --> 24:17.956
through these same empty rooms.

24:18.082 --> 24:20.708
I passed these same colonnades,

24:20.835 --> 24:23.169
these same windowless galleries.

24:23.295 --> 24:25.713
I crossed these same thresholds,

24:25.840 --> 24:28.633
picking my way as if at random

24:28.759 --> 24:31.761
through a maze of identical paths.

24:45.192 --> 24:46.860
And once again,

24:47.403 --> 24:50.655
everything was deserted
in this vast hotel.

24:50.781 --> 24:53.032
Everything was empty.

24:53.450 --> 24:55.118
Empty salons.

24:55.244 --> 24:58.997
Corridors... salons... doors.

24:59.123 --> 25:01.249
Doors... salons.

25:01.375 --> 25:04.294
Empty chairs... deep armchairs.

25:04.879 --> 25:07.297
Staircases... steps.

25:07.464 --> 25:09.966
Steps, one after the other.

25:10.092 --> 25:12.969
Glass objects... empty glasses.

25:13.095 --> 25:16.472
A falling glass... a glass partition.

25:16.640 --> 25:20.059
Letters... a lost letter.

25:20.186 --> 25:22.270
Keys hanging on their rings.

25:22.396 --> 25:24.689
Numbered door keys:

25:24.815 --> 25:27.317
309... 307...

25:27.443 --> 25:29.986
305... 303...

25:30.112 --> 25:32.697
Chandeliers... chandeliers.

25:32.823 --> 25:35.283
Beads... mirrors.

25:35.409 --> 25:38.828
Empty corridors
as far as the eye could see.

25:44.126 --> 25:47.795
And the gardens,
like everything else, were deserted.

25:54.178 --> 25:58.139
It was last year.
Have I changed that much?

25:58.265 --> 26:01.476
Or are you pretending
not to know me?

26:01.602 --> 26:04.479
A year already. Maybe more.

26:05.105 --> 26:07.690
You, at least, haven't changed.

26:07.858 --> 26:10.360
You have the same faraway look,

26:10.527 --> 26:13.863
the same smile,
the same abrupt laugh.

26:13.989 --> 26:17.116
The same way of extending your arm
as if to ward off something -

26:17.243 --> 26:19.786
a child, a branch -

26:19.912 --> 26:23.498
and slowly raising your hand
to the hollow of your shoulder.

26:24.333 --> 26:28.211
You're also wearing
the same perfume.

26:28.587 --> 26:30.463
Try to remember.

26:30.589 --> 26:33.549
It was in the gardens
at Frederiksbad.

26:35.970 --> 26:38.388
You were alone, to one side.

26:38.514 --> 26:42.308
You were standing at a slight angle
against a stone balustrade,

26:42.434 --> 26:47.272
on which you rested your hand,
your arm half-extended.

26:52.319 --> 26:55.238
You were looking
down the central path.

26:55.406 --> 26:58.241
I came toward you,

26:58.409 --> 27:01.160
but I stopped at a distance

27:01.287 --> 27:03.538
and looked at you.

27:04.665 --> 27:07.417
You were turned toward me now.

27:10.337 --> 27:13.131
But you didn't seem to see me.

27:13.340 --> 27:15.425
I looked at you.

27:15.551 --> 27:17.635
You didn't make a move.

27:17.761 --> 27:20.430
I told you that you looked alive.

27:20.556 --> 27:23.766
Your response
was simply to laugh.

27:23.934 --> 27:26.936
To say something,
I spoke of the statue.

27:27.062 --> 27:31.399
I said the man wanted
to hold the woman back.

27:31.525 --> 27:35.361
He had seen something,
some danger probably,

27:35.487 --> 27:38.448
and he stopped his companion
with a gesture.

27:38.615 --> 27:40.950
You replied that it was she

27:41.076 --> 27:43.119
who may have seen something,

27:43.287 --> 27:46.372
but something marvelous,

27:46.498 --> 27:49.042
which she was pointing out.

27:49.793 --> 27:52.211
Both were possibilities.

27:52.338 --> 27:54.505
The man and woman have left home

27:54.631 --> 27:58.009
and have been walking for days.

27:58.135 --> 28:01.763
They've just reached a steep cliff.

28:01.889 --> 28:05.808
He holds his companion back
from the cliff's edge

28:05.934 --> 28:09.979
as she points to the sea
stretching to the horizon.

28:10.981 --> 28:14.484
Then you asked me the names
of these figures.

28:14.651 --> 28:17.236
I said it didn't matter.

28:17.946 --> 28:19.655
You didn't agree,

28:19.782 --> 28:22.492
and you gave them names,

28:22.618 --> 28:25.161
more or less arbitrarily.

28:25.287 --> 28:28.998
Then I said they might as well
be you and me...

28:32.127 --> 28:34.337
or anybody else.

28:41.178 --> 28:44.889
Don't give them names. They may
have had so many other adventures.

28:45.015 --> 28:48.893
Don't forget the dog.
Why is a dog with them?

28:49.019 --> 28:52.814
It's not theirs.
It just happened by.

28:53.857 --> 28:56.025
It's huddled against its mistress.

28:56.151 --> 28:57.693
She's not its mistress,

28:57.861 --> 29:01.447
and it's huddling because
of the narrow pedestal.

29:01.990 --> 29:05.451
Look there.
It's the same couple, but no dog.

29:05.577 --> 29:09.580
They're facing each other.
She holds a hand up to her friend's lips.

29:09.706 --> 29:12.333
But up close, she's looking
somewhere else. You coming?

29:12.459 --> 29:15.586
I don't feel like it.
It's too far.

29:16.380 --> 29:19.048
Follow me, please.

29:19.425 --> 29:21.175
Please.

29:23.720 --> 29:27.557
Impossible, I tell you.
I've never even been to Frederiksbad.

29:27.683 --> 29:30.685
Then somewhere else perhaps.

29:31.228 --> 29:32.728
Karlstadt,

29:33.397 --> 29:34.814
Marienbad,

29:35.441 --> 29:37.275
or Baden-Salsa.

29:37.818 --> 29:40.069
Or even here in this salon.

29:40.446 --> 29:43.823
You followed me here
so that I could show you...

29:45.033 --> 29:46.742
that picture.

29:47.911 --> 29:50.580
You can clearly distinguish
the man's movements

29:50.747 --> 29:54.041
and the gesture the young woman
makes with her arm.

29:54.710 --> 29:57.962
But only from the other side
can you see

29:58.088 --> 30:01.048
that he's trying to stop her
from going further.

30:01.175 --> 30:04.594
He's seen something,
some danger probably.

30:04.761 --> 30:07.305
He motions her to stop.

30:15.689 --> 30:17.565
Excuse me, sir.

30:17.691 --> 30:21.402
I think I can provide
more detailed information.

30:23.780 --> 30:28.284
That is a statue of Charles III
and his wife,

30:28.452 --> 30:31.329
but done at a later period.

30:31.997 --> 30:36.209
The scene is his oath before the Diet,
during his trial for treason.

30:37.836 --> 30:42.006
The classical garments
are pure convention.

31:36.019 --> 31:38.020
You were waiting for me.

31:42.234 --> 31:45.570
No. Why would I be
waiting for you?

31:49.366 --> 31:51.951
I've waited so long for you.

31:52.828 --> 31:54.412
In your dreams?

31:58.667 --> 32:01.711
And you're trying to flee again.

32:02.004 --> 32:03.754
What are you talking about?

32:04.298 --> 32:06.549
I don't understand
a word you're saying.

32:07.384 --> 32:09.427
If it was all a dream,

32:10.053 --> 32:12.388
why should you be afraid?

32:13.140 --> 32:16.392
Then tell me
the rest of our story.

32:17.477 --> 32:20.396
We met again the afternoon
of that same day.

32:20.522 --> 32:22.982
By chance, of course.

32:24.359 --> 32:25.985
I couldn't say.

32:26.486 --> 32:29.238
And where was it this time?

32:35.412 --> 32:36.912
Where?

32:38.040 --> 32:39.749
It doesn't matter.

32:41.335 --> 32:44.879
You were with a group of friends,
chance acquaintances.

32:45.172 --> 32:47.423
People I hardly knew,

32:47.549 --> 32:50.343
and perhaps
you knew them no better.

32:50.469 --> 32:53.929
They were discussing
some affair of the moment

32:54.097 --> 32:56.182
about which I knew nothing.

33:02.814 --> 33:05.941
You knew more about it
than I did, most likely.

33:06.943 --> 33:09.028
I was watching you.

33:13.533 --> 33:17.620
You joined in the conversation
with a zeal I found forced.

33:17.996 --> 33:21.749
It struck me that none
of these people knew who you were,

33:22.292 --> 33:24.335
that I alone knew.

33:24.795 --> 33:27.129
And you didn't know either.

33:28.090 --> 33:30.633
But you avoided my gaze.

33:30.759 --> 33:33.636
You clearly did it on purpose...

33:34.513 --> 33:36.180
intentionally.

33:46.566 --> 33:49.652
I waited. I had time.

33:50.946 --> 33:53.322
I've always believed I had time.

33:58.328 --> 34:00.579
Your eyes darted
from face to face,

34:04.376 --> 34:08.003
To make you look at me,
I said something,

34:08.170 --> 34:10.630
suddenly joining the conversation

34:10.757 --> 34:13.509
with an absurd remark

34:13.635 --> 34:16.804
designed to draw attention
to the speaker.

34:17.179 --> 34:18.848
I forget what I said.

34:23.018 --> 34:26.021
It was you who answered me,
in the sudden silence,

34:26.148 --> 34:29.775
with a sarcastic remark about
the unlikelihood of what I'd said.

34:30.819 --> 34:33.529
The others remained silent.

34:33.864 --> 34:37.867
Again I had the feeling no one
had understood your words.

34:39.369 --> 34:43.038
Even that I was the only one
to have heard them.

35:07.314 --> 35:09.273
To break the silence,

35:09.399 --> 35:12.401
someone mentioned the entertainment
planned for that evening,

35:12.527 --> 35:16.363
or the next day,
or in the days to come.

35:16.490 --> 35:20.075
I don't remember
what was said next.

35:58.907 --> 36:01.116
You disliked
walking in the garden

36:01.243 --> 36:05.371
because of the gravel,
uncomfortable in your street shoes.

36:06.456 --> 36:09.917
One day -
but it was probably much later -

36:10.043 --> 36:12.753
you broke
one of your high heels.

36:12.879 --> 36:15.923
You had to take my arm
to keep your balance

36:16.049 --> 36:18.759
as you removed your shoe.

36:18.885 --> 36:21.387
The heel was almost torn off,

36:21.513 --> 36:24.390
dangling by a thin strip of leather.

36:24.975 --> 36:27.977
You stood there
gazing at it a moment,

36:28.103 --> 36:31.230
the tip of your bare foot
touching the ground,

36:31.356 --> 36:36.193
a bit ahead of the other foot,
in a dance-school pose.

36:36.319 --> 36:39.321
I offered to go
get you another pair.

36:39.447 --> 36:41.156
You refused.

36:41.324 --> 36:45.494
So I said I could also
carry you back in my arms.

36:45.620 --> 36:48.664
You just laughed but said nothing,

36:48.832 --> 36:50.791
as if it was -

36:51.835 --> 36:54.712
You must have walked back,
shoes in hand,

36:54.838 --> 36:57.548
over the gravel to the hotel.

37:10.687 --> 37:12.813
I met you again.

37:15.609 --> 37:17.943
You never seemed
to be waiting for me...

37:19.613 --> 37:22.281
but we kept meeting
at every turn in the path...

37:23.992 --> 37:26.160
behind every shrub,

37:28.330 --> 37:30.539
at the foot of every statue...

37:32.334 --> 37:34.460
at the edge of every fountain.

37:36.588 --> 37:40.007
It was as if,
in that entire garden,

37:41.051 --> 37:42.927
there were only you and me.

37:46.348 --> 37:48.849
We spoke of this and that:

37:49.726 --> 37:51.602
the names of the statues,

37:52.187 --> 37:54.063
the shape of the shrubs,

37:56.483 --> 37:58.400
the water in the fountains.

38:00.695 --> 38:04.573
Or else we said nothing at all.

38:09.704 --> 38:11.246
At night, especially,

38:12.791 --> 38:14.917
you liked to remain silent.

38:18.046 --> 38:21.090
One evening
I went up to your room.

40:14.037 --> 40:16.205
There were always walls,

40:17.123 --> 40:19.124
walls all around me.

40:20.460 --> 40:24.671
Smooth, even, glazed,
without the slightest relief.

40:24.798 --> 40:26.882
There were always walls,

40:27.550 --> 40:29.551
and silence, as well.

40:29.969 --> 40:33.722
I've never heard anyone raise
his voice in this hotel.

40:35.350 --> 40:36.809
No one.

40:37.435 --> 40:40.062
Conversations
took place in a void,

40:40.188 --> 40:42.481
as if words meant nothing,

40:42.607 --> 40:45.859
or weren't meant to,
in any case.

40:45.985 --> 40:48.654
A sentence, once begun,
hung suspended in the air,

40:48.780 --> 40:50.739
as if frozen by the frost,

40:52.158 --> 40:54.284
and picked up, probably,

40:54.410 --> 40:56.954
where it left off, or elsewhere.

40:59.290 --> 41:01.583
It made no difference.

41:01.709 --> 41:05.087
It was always
the same conversations,

41:05.213 --> 41:07.297
the same absent voices.

41:08.675 --> 41:11.009
The servants were mute.

41:11.469 --> 41:14.638
The games were silent, of course.

41:15.515 --> 41:17.558
It was a place for relaxation.

41:18.059 --> 41:20.602
No business was carried out,

41:20.770 --> 41:22.938
no plots were hatched.

41:23.356 --> 41:27.568
No one ever discussed any topic
that might cause excitement.

41:30.738 --> 41:33.532
There were signs everywhere:

41:33.658 --> 41:37.452
"Silence..."

42:12.614 --> 42:15.699
- I think I remember too.
- Still, it seems incredible.

42:15.825 --> 42:17.159
You saw it yourself?

42:17.285 --> 42:19.703
- I heard about it.
- Ah, so you only heard about it.

42:19.829 --> 42:21.371
It's easy to check.

42:21.497 --> 42:23.874
Go through the weather reports
in the newspapers.

42:24.000 --> 42:26.335
Let's go look in the library.

42:42.185 --> 42:44.478
Do you know what I just heard?

42:45.521 --> 42:47.731
Last year, at this time,

42:48.358 --> 42:50.609
it was so cold

42:50.735 --> 42:53.070
that the fountains froze over.

42:55.365 --> 42:57.616
But there must be some mistake.

43:04.332 --> 43:08.752
What do you want from me?
You know it's impossible.

43:09.379 --> 43:11.046
One evening

43:11.506 --> 43:14.883
I went up to your room.

43:15.593 --> 43:17.344
You were alone.

43:22.058 --> 43:25.102
Leave me alone, please.

43:25.687 --> 43:27.437
Leave me alone.

43:27.897 --> 43:29.898
It was almost summer.

43:30.858 --> 43:33.235
Yes, you're right.

43:33.820 --> 43:35.237
Ice...

43:35.655 --> 43:37.864
would be out of the question.

43:40.118 --> 43:41.994
It's time for the concert.

43:42.537 --> 43:44.579
May I accompany you?

44:21.659 --> 44:23.660
Going to the concert?

44:25.121 --> 44:27.456
I'll join you for dinner.

44:36.799 --> 44:40.635
This story is now over.
It is coming to an end.

44:40.803 --> 44:44.514
A few seconds more
and it will solidify

44:44.640 --> 44:47.017
forever in a past of marble.

44:47.143 --> 44:50.145
Like these statues,
this garden carved out of stone,

44:50.271 --> 44:53.982
this very hotel
with its now-deserted rooms.

46:06.264 --> 46:07.389
Leave me alone...

46:07.765 --> 46:09.558
please.

48:04.507 --> 48:07.175
You never seemed
to be waiting for me...

48:08.344 --> 48:11.846
but we kept meeting
at every turn in the path...

48:12.431 --> 48:14.391
behind every shrub...

48:14.934 --> 48:17.018
at the foot of every statue...

48:17.353 --> 48:19.396
at the edge of every fountain.

48:20.022 --> 48:22.857
It was as if
in that entire garden

48:24.026 --> 48:25.819
there were only you and me.

48:27.947 --> 48:30.532
We spoke of this and that:

48:30.700 --> 48:32.492
the names of the statues,

48:32.618 --> 48:34.953
the shape of the shrubs,

48:35.079 --> 48:37.163
the water in the fountains,

48:37.290 --> 48:39.708
the color of the sky.

48:39.875 --> 48:42.377
Or else we said nothing at all.

49:18.581 --> 49:22.208
But you always kept
a certain distance,

49:23.127 --> 49:25.086
as if on some threshold,

49:25.921 --> 49:28.923
the entryway
to someplace too dark

49:29.050 --> 49:30.675
or unfamiliar.

49:34.680 --> 49:36.431
Come here.

49:46.609 --> 49:48.568
Come closer.

50:03.125 --> 50:05.460
Leave me alone, please.

50:11.550 --> 50:15.804
Always walls, corridors, doors...

50:16.806 --> 50:19.974
and beyond, still more walls.

50:20.101 --> 50:23.061
Before coming to you,
before meeting you -

50:23.938 --> 50:26.773
you have no idea
what I had to go through.

50:28.693 --> 50:32.278
And now you are here
where I brought you.

50:32.863 --> 50:35.990
You still shy away,
but you're here in this garden,

50:36.158 --> 50:38.910
within arm's reach,
within earshot,

50:39.161 --> 50:42.497
within my sight,
within arm's reach.

50:46.085 --> 50:47.585
Who are you?

50:47.712 --> 50:49.212
You know.

50:50.715 --> 50:52.674
What's your name?

50:52.842 --> 50:55.343
It doesn't matter.

50:56.429 --> 50:58.555
It doesn't matter.

51:01.142 --> 51:02.809
You're like a shadow,

51:04.186 --> 51:06.855
and you're waiting
for me to approach.

51:08.983 --> 51:10.650
Leave me alone.

51:10.860 --> 51:13.027
Leave me alone.

51:21.454 --> 51:23.872
It's already too late.

51:25.875 --> 51:28.543
You asked me
not to see you again.

51:29.378 --> 51:31.796
We did see each other again,
of course -

51:31.922 --> 51:33.840
the next day,

51:33.966 --> 51:36.718
or the day after,
or the day after that.

51:38.179 --> 51:40.388
Perhaps it was by chance.

51:40.931 --> 51:44.350
I told you that you had
to go away with me.

51:44.477 --> 51:48.146
You said it was impossible,
of course.

51:49.064 --> 51:51.065
But you knew it was possible,

51:51.192 --> 51:55.069
and that now there's
nothing else for you to do.

51:55.988 --> 51:58.281
Yes... perhaps.

52:00.409 --> 52:02.952
Oh, no.
I don't know anymore.

52:04.246 --> 52:08.082
But why me?
Why must it be me?

52:08.250 --> 52:10.168
You were waiting for me.

52:10.711 --> 52:15.215
No, I wasn't waiting for you,
or anyone.

52:15.341 --> 52:17.592
You weren't waiting for anything.

52:17.718 --> 52:20.178
It was as if you were dead.

52:21.013 --> 52:24.974
That's not true.
You're still alive.

52:25.935 --> 52:28.937
You're here. I can see you.

52:31.273 --> 52:32.899
Do you remember?

52:36.195 --> 52:37.987
That's not true...

52:38.113 --> 52:39.322
probably.

52:40.115 --> 52:42.450
You've already forgotten it all.

52:44.161 --> 52:45.662
It's not true.

52:45.788 --> 52:48.456
It's not true.
You're about to leave.

52:48.624 --> 52:50.333
Your door is still open.

52:50.459 --> 52:53.837
Why? What do you
expect from me?

52:53.963 --> 52:57.006
What other life can you offer me?

52:57.132 --> 52:59.801
This isn't about another life.

53:00.386 --> 53:03.638
This is about your life.

53:06.100 --> 53:07.684
Try to remember.

53:08.811 --> 53:11.980
It was evening.
The last evening, probably.

53:12.982 --> 53:14.732
It was almost dark.

53:15.651 --> 53:19.988
A faint shadow moved slowly
through the dusk.

53:21.323 --> 53:24.659
Even before I could make out
your features,

53:25.995 --> 53:28.079
I knew it was you.

53:29.456 --> 53:32.083
When you recognized me,
you stopped.

53:32.877 --> 53:35.962
We stood there,
a few yards apart,

53:37.256 --> 53:38.882
without speaking.

53:39.884 --> 53:43.344
You stood in front of me,

53:44.096 --> 53:45.805
waiting perhaps,

53:47.182 --> 53:51.060
as if unable to take another step
forward or turn back.

53:53.939 --> 53:57.191
You were there, standing straight

53:58.611 --> 54:00.194
and still,

54:01.530 --> 54:03.615
your arms at your side.

54:06.327 --> 54:08.202
And you looked at me.

54:09.622 --> 54:12.874
Your eyes are wide open,
much too wide.

54:13.042 --> 54:16.544
Your lips are slightly parted,
as if you were about to speak,

54:16.712 --> 54:20.131
or moan, or scream.

54:20.257 --> 54:21.925
You are afraid.

54:22.551 --> 54:25.094
Your mouth opens a bit more,

54:25.220 --> 54:27.722
your eyes open wider still.

54:27.890 --> 54:30.266
Your hand is extended
in an incomplete gesture

54:30.392 --> 54:32.936
of expectation, uncertainty.

54:33.896 --> 54:36.314
Or perhaps of appeal,

54:36.440 --> 54:38.149
or defense.

54:38.525 --> 54:40.360
Your fingers tremble slightly.

54:41.570 --> 54:43.112
You're afraid.

54:59.755 --> 55:01.339
Who was that?

55:02.758 --> 55:04.634
Your husband?

55:04.760 --> 55:06.344
Perhaps.

55:07.596 --> 55:09.263
He was looking for you,

55:10.265 --> 55:12.433
or else he just happened by.

55:14.144 --> 55:16.521
He was already
approaching you.

55:18.273 --> 55:20.191
But you remained frozen,

55:20.317 --> 55:22.986
withdrawn, absent.

55:24.989 --> 55:28.116
He didn't appear
to recognize you at first.

55:28.993 --> 55:30.994
He took a step forward.

55:31.745 --> 55:34.288
Something about you
confused him.

55:34.790 --> 55:36.833
Another step.

55:38.127 --> 55:40.253
You looked right through him.

55:42.840 --> 55:44.799
He thought it best to turn back.

55:46.218 --> 55:47.635
And now

55:48.512 --> 55:51.305
you keep staring into space.

55:52.474 --> 55:54.517
You keep seeing him...

55:56.061 --> 55:57.687
his gray eyes,

55:59.690 --> 56:01.899
his gray silhouette,

56:04.319 --> 56:05.778
and his smile.

56:14.538 --> 56:16.372
And you're afraid.

56:18.417 --> 56:22.837
You fear he might come back,
or that he's already there,

56:22.963 --> 56:26.132
when I again enter your room.

56:26.258 --> 56:29.844
His room was adjacent to yours,
separated by a sitting room.

56:30.637 --> 56:33.681
But at that hour,
he's in the game room anyway.

56:33.807 --> 56:36.309
I had told you I'd be coming.

56:36.435 --> 56:38.227
You'd made no reply.

56:38.479 --> 56:40.980
I found all the doors ajar.

56:41.106 --> 56:43.024
The hallway door,

56:43.150 --> 56:45.860
the sitting room door,
your bedroom door.

56:45.986 --> 56:48.488
I only had to push them open,
one by one,

56:48.614 --> 56:51.991
then close them behind me,
one by one.

56:53.911 --> 56:55.995
You know the rest.

56:59.208 --> 57:03.211
No, I don't know the rest.
I don't know you.

57:03.337 --> 57:06.714
I don't know that room, that silly bed,
that fireplace with the mirror.

57:06.882 --> 57:10.760
What mirror? What fireplace?
What did you say?

57:10.886 --> 57:14.097
Yes... I don't know anymore.

57:14.223 --> 57:16.140
It's not true. I don't know.

57:16.266 --> 57:19.393
If it's not true,
why would you be here?

57:22.648 --> 57:24.565
What was the mirror like?

57:24.691 --> 57:27.110
There's no mirror
over the fireplace.

57:28.153 --> 57:29.904
It's a painting.

57:30.531 --> 57:33.741
A landscape, I think.
A snowy landscape.

57:35.035 --> 57:37.245
The mirror is over the chest.

57:39.206 --> 57:41.916
There's also a dressing table
with a mirror.

57:42.417 --> 57:45.586
And other furniture...

57:46.797 --> 57:47.964
of course.

57:49.174 --> 57:50.758
What kind of bed?

57:51.385 --> 57:53.302
A double bed, probably.

57:54.054 --> 57:56.597
What was the view
from the windows?

57:56.765 --> 57:59.684
I don't know. The windows...

58:01.270 --> 58:04.856
What room? I've never been
in any bedroom with you.

58:04.982 --> 58:06.983
You don't want to remember...

58:07.109 --> 58:08.776
because you're afraid.

58:09.611 --> 58:12.780
And you don't recognize
this photo either?

58:13.949 --> 58:15.366
Yes, I do.

58:16.285 --> 58:18.828
No, I don't. I don't know.
I don't remember.

58:18.954 --> 58:20.621
You know who took it.

58:20.789 --> 58:21.873
You're lying.

58:21.999 --> 58:24.917
It was last year.
I had to insist on taking it.

58:25.043 --> 58:27.336
You said
it would make you uneasy.

58:28.213 --> 58:31.132
Yes, that's true. I was right.

58:32.467 --> 58:38.556
Well, I remember that room
where you waited for me.

58:39.808 --> 58:43.769
True, there was a mirror
over the chest.

58:44.563 --> 58:47.565
It was in that mirror
that I first saw you,

58:47.691 --> 58:50.860
when I silently pushed
the door open.

58:51.445 --> 58:53.237
You sat on the edge of the bed,

58:53.363 --> 58:57.491
in a kind of dressing gown,
or negligee, in white.

58:57.659 --> 58:59.493
I remember you
dressed all in white.

58:59.620 --> 59:01.746
You wore white slippers
and this ring.

59:01.872 --> 59:04.665
No, I'm sure you're making it up.

59:04.833 --> 59:07.335
I've never had
a white dressing gown.

59:08.003 --> 59:10.129
You see, it's someone else.

59:11.381 --> 59:12.965
If you say so.

59:13.091 --> 59:14.884
But I remember the room,

59:15.010 --> 59:18.387
and the white feathers
in which you lay across the bed.

59:19.681 --> 59:21.641
Be quiet, please.

59:21.767 --> 59:23.517
You're completely mad.

59:24.311 --> 59:26.979
"No, no, please."

59:28.857 --> 59:31.442
I hear your voice as it was then.

59:32.694 --> 59:34.195
You were afraid.

59:35.030 --> 59:38.199
You were afraid... even then.

59:38.533 --> 59:42.286
You've always been afraid.
But I loved your fear that evening.

59:44.373 --> 59:45.915
I looked at you,

59:46.792 --> 59:49.460
letting you struggle a bit.

59:49.586 --> 59:51.754
I loved you.

59:51.880 --> 59:53.881
I loved you.

59:54.049 --> 59:56.217
There was
something in your eyes.

59:56.385 --> 59:59.053
You were alive.

59:59.846 --> 01:00:01.347
Anyway...

01:00:01.765 --> 01:00:03.557
in the beginning...

01:00:05.143 --> 01:00:06.644
Try to remember.

01:00:08.730 --> 01:00:10.398
Oh, not at all.

01:00:11.900 --> 01:00:14.318
It was probably not by force.

01:00:20.158 --> 01:00:22.618
But only you know.

01:01:18.133 --> 01:01:19.675
What is it?

01:01:20.135 --> 01:01:21.635
It's nothing.

01:01:23.472 --> 01:01:24.638
Are you tired?

01:01:24.806 --> 01:01:27.933
A bit, yes. I think I am.

01:01:28.060 --> 01:01:30.311
The sun all of a sudden.

01:01:31.688 --> 01:01:34.523
We can go back in, if you wish.

01:01:36.485 --> 01:01:38.027
If you wish.

01:03:29.306 --> 01:03:32.183
That was the day
I took your picture.

01:03:33.602 --> 01:03:36.604
And you asked me
to give you a year...

01:03:38.148 --> 01:03:40.858
thinking perhaps to test me...

01:03:42.194 --> 01:03:43.944
or wear me down...

01:03:44.905 --> 01:03:46.864
or just forget all about me.

01:03:48.617 --> 01:03:50.242
But time...

01:03:50.785 --> 01:03:52.453
doesn't count.

01:03:53.330 --> 01:03:55.706
I've come for you now.

01:04:03.965 --> 01:04:05.799
It's impossible.

01:04:07.677 --> 01:04:09.678
It's impossible.

01:04:11.223 --> 01:04:12.723
Naturally.

01:04:13.350 --> 01:04:15.809
But you know it is possible,

01:04:15.977 --> 01:04:18.854
that you're ready,
that we're leaving.

01:04:20.732 --> 01:04:23.192
What makes you so sure?

01:04:23.318 --> 01:04:25.194
Leaving for where?

01:04:25.320 --> 01:04:28.239
Anywhere. I don't know.

01:04:28.365 --> 01:04:30.282
You see.

01:04:30.408 --> 01:04:32.910
It's best that
we part for good.

01:04:33.703 --> 01:04:35.287
Last year -

01:04:35.413 --> 01:04:37.623
No, it's impossible.

01:04:39.167 --> 01:04:40.834
You will leave alone...

01:04:42.295 --> 01:04:43.712
and then we'll be forever...

01:04:43.838 --> 01:04:45.297
It's not true!

01:04:46.091 --> 01:04:48.300
It's not true
that we need absence,

01:04:48.426 --> 01:04:50.678
loneliness, endless waiting.

01:04:50.804 --> 01:04:52.304
It's not true!

01:04:54.349 --> 01:04:56.058
But you're afraid.

01:05:04.234 --> 01:05:06.652
But it's too late now.

01:05:13.034 --> 01:05:15.369
He had just left your room.

01:05:15.954 --> 01:05:18.706
I don't know what violent scene
must have taken place

01:05:18.873 --> 01:05:20.791
a moment before.

01:05:59.247 --> 01:06:02.583
The window of your room
looks out on the gardens,

01:06:02.709 --> 01:06:04.752
but you didn't see him go out,

01:06:04.919 --> 01:06:07.212
which might have
reassured you.

01:06:08.340 --> 01:06:10.382
Then you turned back to the bed.

01:06:10.508 --> 01:06:13.761
At first unsure,
not knowing where to go,

01:06:13.928 --> 01:06:17.264
you turned back to the bed
and sat down.

01:06:18.642 --> 01:06:21.977
Then you let your body
fall back and you -

01:06:23.772 --> 01:06:26.106
You turned back to the bed.

01:06:29.903 --> 01:06:32.112
After lying there a few seconds,

01:06:32.280 --> 01:06:34.615
maybe a few minutes, unsure,

01:06:34.741 --> 01:06:36.575
not knowing what to do,

01:06:36.701 --> 01:06:39.495
staring straight ahead into space.

01:06:45.210 --> 01:06:47.419
And you turned back to the bed.

01:06:50.173 --> 01:06:51.799
Listen to me.

01:06:52.634 --> 01:06:54.176
Try to remember.

01:06:55.470 --> 01:06:57.471
Listen to me, please.

01:06:58.973 --> 01:07:01.141
Yes, there was -

01:07:02.143 --> 01:07:05.813
Yes, it's true.
There was a large mirror by the door.

01:07:05.980 --> 01:07:09.191
A huge mirror
you didn't dare go near,

01:07:09.317 --> 01:07:11.193
as if it scared you.

01:07:13.697 --> 01:07:17.157
But you insist on pretending
not to believe me.

01:07:17.283 --> 01:07:20.285
Where are you?
Where have you gone?

01:07:20.412 --> 01:07:24.039
Why keep trying to run away?
It's too late.

01:07:24.165 --> 01:07:27.167
It was too late even then.
There was no more -

01:07:27.293 --> 01:07:29.336
The door was closed now.

01:07:29.462 --> 01:07:31.213
No, the door was closed.

01:07:38.596 --> 01:07:40.139
Listen to me.

01:07:40.265 --> 01:07:42.558
What more proof do you need?

01:07:44.394 --> 01:07:46.228
I'd kept a photo of you,

01:07:46.354 --> 01:07:49.690
taken one afternoon in the gardens,
a few days before you left.

01:07:50.442 --> 01:07:54.862
But when I gave it to you,
you again said that it proved nothing.

01:07:55.029 --> 01:07:57.072
Anyone could have taken
the snapshot,

01:07:57.198 --> 01:07:59.491
anytime, anywhere.

01:07:59.617 --> 01:08:02.578
A garden. Any garden.

01:08:04.205 --> 01:08:07.875
I would have had to show you
the white feathers,

01:08:08.251 --> 01:08:11.587
the sea of white feathers
where your body -

01:08:11.713 --> 01:08:13.756
But all bodies look alike,

01:08:13.882 --> 01:08:18.385
as do all feather negligees,
all hotels, all statues, all gardens.

01:08:19.720 --> 01:08:24.057
But this garden, for me,
was like no other.

01:08:24.225 --> 01:08:25.809
Every day

01:08:25.935 --> 01:08:27.978
I'd meet you there.

01:08:35.862 --> 01:08:37.362
It's afternoon.

01:08:37.947 --> 01:08:39.948
The next day, probably.

01:08:42.618 --> 01:08:44.870
I'd just told you we were leaving -

01:08:44.996 --> 01:08:47.538
no, you weren't laughing -

01:08:47.665 --> 01:08:50.334
that we were leaving
the next morning for good,

01:08:50.460 --> 01:08:52.169
while he -

01:08:52.879 --> 01:08:55.798
No, that's not it.

01:08:56.256 --> 01:08:59.091
Yes, we were in your room.

01:08:59.719 --> 01:09:02.429
We'd decided the day before
that we would leave.

01:09:02.596 --> 01:09:05.599
You had agreed -
reluctantly, perhaps.

01:09:06.434 --> 01:09:08.435
I was in your room.

01:09:09.687 --> 01:09:12.689
The first thing you see
from the door is the bed.

01:09:13.608 --> 01:09:16.693
But you can't see
the dressing table.

01:09:17.111 --> 01:09:20.072
You were probably on the other side,
near the window,

01:09:20.198 --> 01:09:22.616
perhaps watching the garden.

01:09:23.117 --> 01:09:25.077
I don't remember exactly.

01:09:25.953 --> 01:09:28.788
I'd met him
going down the stairs.

01:09:28.915 --> 01:09:31.124
He'd just left your room.

01:09:31.626 --> 01:09:33.752
Or was that another day?

01:09:35.462 --> 01:09:38.340
That night
everything was empty.

01:09:39.300 --> 01:09:40.884
Stairs...

01:09:41.803 --> 01:09:43.178
corridors. ..

01:09:44.055 --> 01:09:45.764
stairs.

01:10:45.867 --> 01:10:47.826
I don't remember anymore.

01:10:48.453 --> 01:10:50.621
I don't remember myself.

01:10:53.333 --> 01:10:55.334
I don't remember anymore.

01:11:01.966 --> 01:11:04.468
I knocked.
Didn't you hear?

01:11:06.554 --> 01:11:09.348
I did.
I told you to come in.

01:11:09.515 --> 01:11:11.141
I see.

01:11:13.394 --> 01:11:15.854
You must not have
said it very loud.

01:11:43.299 --> 01:11:45.509
What's this photo?

01:11:46.135 --> 01:11:49.471
As you can see,
it's an old photo of me.

01:11:52.266 --> 01:11:53.433
When was it taken?

01:11:53.601 --> 01:11:55.978
I don't know. Last year.

01:11:58.106 --> 01:11:59.773
Who took it?

01:11:59.941 --> 01:12:02.776
I don't know.
Frank, perhaps.

01:12:03.945 --> 01:12:07.280
Frank wasn't here last year.

01:12:15.206 --> 01:12:17.958
It may not have been here.

01:12:18.960 --> 01:12:21.795
It may have been
at Frederiksbad.

01:12:23.464 --> 01:12:25.674
Or someone else took it.

01:12:25.800 --> 01:12:27.092
Yes, most likely.

01:12:30.471 --> 01:12:32.889
What did you do this afternoon?

01:12:33.016 --> 01:12:35.100
Nothing. I read.

01:12:37.937 --> 01:12:41.023
I looked for you.
Were you in the gardens?

01:12:41.149 --> 01:12:44.609
No, in the green salon,
near the music room.

01:12:44.736 --> 01:12:46.153
I see.

01:12:47.155 --> 01:12:49.364
But I looked in there.

01:12:50.116 --> 01:12:52.325
Did you have
something to tell me?

01:13:00.168 --> 01:13:02.002
You look anxious.

01:13:03.171 --> 01:13:04.463
I'm a bit tired.

01:13:04.589 --> 01:13:06.715
Get some rest.

01:13:06.841 --> 01:13:09.551
Remember:
That's why we're here.

01:13:13.639 --> 01:13:15.182
Are you going out?

01:13:15.808 --> 01:13:18.101
I may go down
to the shooting gallery.

01:13:18.227 --> 01:13:19.478
This late?

01:13:19.604 --> 01:13:21.521
Why not?

01:13:23.524 --> 01:13:25.400
Anderson arrives tomorrow.

01:13:25.526 --> 01:13:27.903
We'll lunch with him at 12:00,

01:13:28.029 --> 01:13:30.363
if you have no other plans.

01:13:32.200 --> 01:13:35.452
No, of course not.
What plans?

01:13:35.578 --> 01:13:37.454
See you tonight, then.

01:13:46.506 --> 01:13:48.215
Once the door shut,

01:13:48.382 --> 01:13:51.718
you listened for footsteps
in the adjoining sitting room,

01:13:51.886 --> 01:13:53.637
but you heard nothing.

01:13:53.763 --> 01:13:57.224
Nor did you hear any doors
open or close.

01:13:58.226 --> 01:14:01.103
The easiest way to the shooting gallery
is through the terrace

01:14:01.229 --> 01:14:03.688
along the rear of the hotel.

01:14:03.815 --> 01:14:05.732
But without opening the window,

01:14:05.858 --> 01:14:09.319
you can't see that space
at the foot of the wall.

01:14:09.737 --> 01:14:12.447
You hoped to hear
his footsteps on the gravel,

01:14:12.573 --> 01:14:16.076
but you can't hear that high up
with the window closed.

01:14:16.244 --> 01:14:19.412
There's probably
no gravel there anyway.

01:14:57.702 --> 01:15:00.245
An arm half-bent
toward your hair.

01:15:00.371 --> 01:15:03.290
A hand cast down,
the other on your chin,

01:15:03.457 --> 01:15:06.001
index finger over your mouth...

01:15:07.378 --> 01:15:09.504
as if to stifle a cry.

01:15:15.761 --> 01:15:18.054
And now here you are again.

01:15:22.643 --> 01:15:25.645
No, that isn't the right ending.

01:15:25.813 --> 01:15:28.023
I must have you alive.

01:15:29.650 --> 01:15:33.653
Alive as you have been,
every evening,

01:15:33.779 --> 01:15:36.656
for weeks, for months.

01:15:41.162 --> 01:15:44.247
I've never stayed
anywhere that long.

01:15:44.373 --> 01:15:46.666
Yes, I know.

01:15:55.718 --> 01:15:57.677
I don't care.

01:15:57.803 --> 01:16:01.014
For days and days.

01:16:05.478 --> 01:16:07.687
Why do you still refuse

01:16:09.482 --> 01:16:11.608
to remember anything?

01:16:13.611 --> 01:16:15.362
You're raving.

01:16:16.614 --> 01:16:18.365
I'm tired.

01:16:19.200 --> 01:16:20.867
Leave me alone.

01:19:02.279 --> 01:19:04.781
- It's a stupid game.
- There's a trick.

01:19:04.907 --> 01:19:06.783
Just take an odd number.

01:19:06.909 --> 01:19:08.701
There must be rules.

01:19:08.828 --> 01:19:10.537
Whoever goes first loses.

01:19:10.663 --> 01:19:14.541
I remember Frank played last year.
I'm sure of it.

01:19:14.917 --> 01:19:17.794
You have to take the complement
of seven each time.

01:19:17.920 --> 01:19:19.671
From which row?

01:19:21.006 --> 01:19:23.550
If you'd care to begin.

01:19:24.051 --> 01:19:25.927
With pleasure.

01:19:26.053 --> 01:19:28.221
Which one shall I take?

01:19:32.059 --> 01:19:33.852
This one.

01:19:33.978 --> 01:19:35.478
Fine.

01:19:53.456 --> 01:19:54.831
Oh, well...

01:19:55.499 --> 01:19:56.958
I lose.

01:20:06.677 --> 01:20:08.803
Whoever goes first wins.

01:20:09.889 --> 01:20:12.724
You have to take
an even number.

01:20:12.850 --> 01:20:15.101
The lowest whole odd number.

01:20:15.227 --> 01:20:17.562
It's a logarithmic series.

01:20:18.647 --> 01:20:20.982
You have to pick
a different row each time.

01:20:21.692 --> 01:20:24.277
- Divided by three.
- Seven times seven, 49.

01:21:04.360 --> 01:21:06.027
It's not true.

01:21:06.654 --> 01:21:08.404
It wasn't by force.

01:21:09.406 --> 01:21:10.949
Try to remember.

01:21:11.909 --> 01:21:14.077
For days and days,

01:21:14.745 --> 01:21:16.704
every night.

01:21:16.830 --> 01:21:19.249
All bedrooms are alike.

01:21:19.375 --> 01:21:23.503
But that bedroom, for me,
was like no other.

01:21:24.171 --> 01:21:26.047
There were no more doors,

01:21:26.173 --> 01:21:29.050
no more corridors,
no more hotel,

01:21:29.176 --> 01:21:30.843
no more garden.

01:21:30.970 --> 01:21:33.263
There wasn't even
a garden anymore.

01:22:17.016 --> 01:22:21.352
It was the middle of the night.
The hotel slept.

01:22:22.062 --> 01:22:24.397
We met in the garden,

01:22:25.065 --> 01:22:26.816
as we used to.

01:22:27.401 --> 01:22:30.111
You recognized me and stopped.

01:22:30.738 --> 01:22:34.616
We stood like that,
a few yards apart, without speaking.

01:22:36.452 --> 01:22:40.121
You stood there in front of me,
waiting,

01:22:40.247 --> 01:22:43.499
unable to take a step forward
or turn back.

01:22:45.252 --> 01:22:49.088
You were there,
standing straight and still,

01:22:49.256 --> 01:22:51.257
arms by your side,

01:22:51.383 --> 01:22:55.678
wrapped in a kind
of long, dark cape.

01:22:56.597 --> 01:22:58.431
Black, perhaps.

01:23:02.269 --> 01:23:04.312
Listen to me, for pity's sake.

01:23:04.438 --> 01:23:07.190
We can't turn back now.

01:23:08.942 --> 01:23:11.694
All I ask is to wait a little longer.

01:23:11.820 --> 01:23:13.529
Next year, here,

01:23:13.656 --> 01:23:16.074
same day, same time,

01:23:16.200 --> 01:23:17.784
and I'll follow you anywhere.

01:23:17.951 --> 01:23:20.078
Why wait any longer?

01:23:20.204 --> 01:23:23.164
I beg of you. We must.

01:23:24.416 --> 01:23:26.334
A year isn't long.

01:23:29.546 --> 01:23:31.255
For me, it's nothing.

01:23:31.382 --> 01:23:34.467
- Listen to me.
- So you need more time?

01:23:34.593 --> 01:23:36.469
How long? How long?

01:23:36.637 --> 01:23:38.054
I'm telling you why.

01:23:38.180 --> 01:23:41.140
- I've waited too long as it is.
- Lower your voice, please.

01:23:41.308 --> 01:23:44.644
Whose feelings are you sparing?
What are you hoping for?

01:23:45.312 --> 01:23:47.855
Do you think this is so easy?

01:23:50.693 --> 01:23:52.110
I don't know.

01:23:54.154 --> 01:23:56.155
And perhaps, as well...

01:23:57.950 --> 01:23:59.992
I don't have the courage.

01:24:02.371 --> 01:24:04.372
I can't put it off again.

01:24:04.498 --> 01:24:09.335
A few hours is all I ask.

01:24:12.464 --> 01:24:14.006
A few months,

01:24:14.508 --> 01:24:16.008
a few hours,

01:24:16.135 --> 01:24:18.177
a few minutes,

01:24:18.303 --> 01:24:20.054
a few seconds more.

01:24:21.056 --> 01:24:23.850
As if you still hesitated

01:24:23.976 --> 01:24:25.852
to part with him,

01:24:27.146 --> 01:24:28.980
to part with yourself...

01:24:30.399 --> 01:24:31.858
as if his figure -

01:24:32.025 --> 01:24:33.609
Someone's coming.

01:24:33.736 --> 01:24:36.112
Be quiet, for pity's sake.

01:24:49.793 --> 01:24:53.004
Go away if you love me.

01:25:41.220 --> 01:25:43.304
A feeling of faintness, probably.

01:25:43.430 --> 01:25:45.181
A dizzy spell.

01:25:45.307 --> 01:25:47.809
Yes, it's nothing.

01:25:48.727 --> 01:25:50.436
You're better already.

01:25:50.604 --> 01:25:53.231
Yes. I'll go upstairs.

01:25:53.357 --> 01:25:55.399
Shall I take you up?

01:25:57.277 --> 01:25:59.445
I'd rather be alone.

01:26:00.155 --> 01:26:01.864
I'm going.

01:26:22.886 --> 01:26:24.804
And once again

01:26:24.930 --> 01:26:27.640
I walked down
these same corridors,

01:26:27.808 --> 01:26:31.102
walking for days, for months,

01:26:31.228 --> 01:26:34.438
for years, in search of you.

01:26:34.565 --> 01:26:37.483
There can be no stopping
between these walls,

01:26:37.651 --> 01:26:39.652
no respite.

01:26:39.778 --> 01:26:43.948
I'll leave tonight,
taking you with me.

01:26:52.124 --> 01:26:55.877
It would be a year ago
that this story began

01:26:56.003 --> 01:27:00.256
with me waiting for you,
and you waiting for me too.

01:27:01.341 --> 01:27:02.717
A year.

01:27:03.760 --> 01:27:05.678
You couldn't have gone on

01:27:05.846 --> 01:27:09.807
living amid
this trompe-lâ€™Å“il architecture,

01:27:09.933 --> 01:27:12.435
amid these mirrors and columns,

01:27:13.312 --> 01:27:16.355
amid these doors always ajar,

01:27:16.523 --> 01:27:18.983
these oversized staircases,

01:27:19.109 --> 01:27:21.986
in this always-open bedroom.

01:27:34.207 --> 01:27:36.667
Where are you, my lost love?

01:27:38.378 --> 01:27:40.087
Here.

01:27:40.213 --> 01:27:42.006
I'm here.

01:27:42.132 --> 01:27:45.051
I'm with you in this room.

01:27:45.177 --> 01:27:46.552
No, you're not.

01:27:47.054 --> 01:27:48.930
That's already no longer true.

01:27:52.267 --> 01:27:53.893
Help me.

01:27:54.019 --> 01:27:56.062
I beg of you, help me.

01:27:58.231 --> 01:27:59.565
Take my hand.

01:27:59.691 --> 01:28:01.567
Yes, you were feeling better.

01:28:01.735 --> 01:28:03.235
Hold my hands tight.

01:28:03.403 --> 01:28:05.738
Yes, you'll get some sleep now.

01:28:07.616 --> 01:28:10.576
Yes, you'll be back on your feet
for that Ackerson...

01:28:10.702 --> 01:28:11.369
Where are you?

01:28:11.495 --> 01:28:13.287
or Patterson...

01:28:13.413 --> 01:28:15.831
whom you're to lunch with.

01:28:15.958 --> 01:28:17.875
Don't let me go.

01:28:18.001 --> 01:28:20.252
You know it's too late.

01:28:22.005 --> 01:28:24.924
Tomorrow I'll be alone.

01:28:26.218 --> 01:28:29.095
I'll find your room empty.

01:28:30.973 --> 01:28:32.264
I'm cold.

01:28:35.268 --> 01:28:36.477
You need nothing.

01:28:36.603 --> 01:28:38.437
Not yet.

01:28:38.563 --> 01:28:42.274
You don't know what came over you
downstairs just now.

01:28:43.068 --> 01:28:45.945
You don't remember
quite what happened.

01:28:47.698 --> 01:28:51.617
You hope you didn't cause a scandal,
screaming like that.

01:28:56.456 --> 01:28:59.959
When this man
who may be your husband had gone,

01:29:00.127 --> 01:29:01.961
whom you may love,

01:29:02.129 --> 01:29:06.799
whom you will leave tonight forever,
without his knowing it yet,

01:29:06.925 --> 01:29:08.926
you packed some personal affairs

01:29:09.052 --> 01:29:12.138
and prepared
a quick change of clothes.

01:29:12.681 --> 01:29:15.683
We agreed to leave
during the night,

01:29:15.809 --> 01:29:18.185
but you wanted
to give one last chance

01:29:18.311 --> 01:29:21.564
to the man who still seemed
to have a hold on you.

01:29:21.690 --> 01:29:23.482
I don't know.

01:29:23.650 --> 01:29:25.359
I agreed to it.

01:29:25.485 --> 01:29:27.319
He should have come.

01:29:27.446 --> 01:29:29.697
He could have taken you back.

01:29:31.867 --> 01:29:34.827
The hotel was deserted,
as if abandoned.

01:29:34.953 --> 01:29:37.246
Everyone was at the play,

01:29:37.372 --> 01:29:39.165
announced so long ago,

01:29:39.332 --> 01:29:42.084
from which your fainting
had excused you.

01:29:42.544 --> 01:29:44.545
I think it was -

01:29:45.005 --> 01:29:47.173
I forget the title.

01:29:47.716 --> 01:29:50.801
It was due to finish late.

01:29:51.470 --> 01:29:54.722
After leaving you
lying on the bed in your room,

01:29:54.848 --> 01:29:57.016
he went down to the little theater

01:29:57.184 --> 01:30:00.352
and joined a group of friends.

01:30:00.479 --> 01:30:03.522
He'd have to come up
before the final curtain

01:30:03.690 --> 01:30:06.192
if he really wanted you to stay.

01:30:10.489 --> 01:30:12.990
You were dressed, ready to go,

01:30:13.116 --> 01:30:16.702
and you sat down
to wait for him alone

01:30:16.828 --> 01:30:18.996
in a sort of hall or salon

01:30:19.122 --> 01:30:22.083
that one had to cross
to reach your rooms.

01:30:23.210 --> 01:30:27.296
Out of some superstition,
you'd asked me to give you until midnight.

01:30:28.715 --> 01:30:31.967
I don't know if you were hoping
he'd come or not.

01:30:32.094 --> 01:30:36.347
For a moment, I even thought
you'd told him everything

01:30:36.473 --> 01:30:39.391
and arranged for him
to meet you.

01:30:40.018 --> 01:30:43.229
Or perhaps you were thinking

01:30:43.396 --> 01:30:45.397
I wouldn't come.

01:30:50.695 --> 01:30:54.031
I came at the appointed time.

01:33:03.411 --> 01:33:05.162
The hotel grounds

01:33:05.288 --> 01:33:07.539
were laid out like
a kind of French garden,

01:33:08.625 --> 01:33:11.627
devoid of trees, flowers,

01:33:11.753 --> 01:33:14.338
or any kind of vegetation.

01:33:15.048 --> 01:33:18.968
Gravel, stone, marble,

01:33:19.094 --> 01:33:20.844
and straight lines

01:33:20.971 --> 01:33:23.222
marked out rigid spaces,

01:33:23.390 --> 01:33:25.975
areas devoid of mystery.

01:33:26.768 --> 01:33:31.272
At first glance, it seemed
impossible to lose your way.

01:33:31.398 --> 01:33:33.482
At first glance.

01:33:33.608 --> 01:33:35.859
Down straight paths,

01:33:35.986 --> 01:33:39.697
between statues with frozen gestures
and granite slabs,

01:33:40.365 --> 01:33:42.866
where even now

01:33:42.993 --> 01:33:46.245
you were losing your way

01:33:46.830 --> 01:33:48.706
forever,

01:33:48.832 --> 01:33:51.125
in the stillness of the night,

01:33:51.251 --> 01:33:53.752
alone with me.
