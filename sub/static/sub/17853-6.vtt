<i>Previously on</i>
The Curse of Oak Island...

00:03.504 --> 00:06.305
We're poised on the vault.
How prophetic is that?

00:06.307 --> 00:10.075
We're feet away from what we've
labored for for eight years.

00:10.077 --> 00:11.143
Come on, baby.

00:11.145 --> 00:12.344
Wood!

00:12.346 --> 00:13.445
Wood!

00:13.447 --> 00:15.314
I'll be damned.

00:15.316 --> 00:16.548
We found it. Let's dig it up.

00:16.550 --> 00:18.083
Now, we have to be very careful

00:18.085 --> 00:19.218
- at this point.
- No, we don't.

00:19.220 --> 00:21.487
We need that thing back
in the hole.

00:21.489 --> 00:23.555
Box, vault, whatever,
it's tangible now.

00:23.557 --> 00:25.224
We mustn't make a mistake.

00:25.226 --> 00:26.258
We need to proceed slowly.

00:26.260 --> 00:27.726
Well, let's just quit then.

00:31.399 --> 00:34.666
<i>There is an island
in the North Atlantic</i>

00:34.668 --> 00:37.503
<i>where people have been
looking for an incredible</i>

00:37.505 --> 00:40.672
<i>treasure for more
than 200 years.</i>

00:40.674 --> 00:45.077
<i>So far, they have
found bits of gold chain,</i>

00:45.079 --> 00:49.415
<i>a stone slab with strange
symbols carved into it,</i>

00:49.417 --> 00:52.684
<i>even a 17th century
Spanish coin.</i>

00:52.686 --> 00:55.220
<i>To date, six men have died</i>

00:55.222 --> 00:57.122
<i>trying to solve the mystery.</i>

00:57.124 --> 01:00.125
<i>And according to legend,</i>

01:00.127 --> 01:03.295
<i>one more will have to die,</i>

01:03.297 --> 01:06.498
<i>before the treasure
can be found.</i>

01:23.284 --> 01:24.850
<i>Joyful, but puzzled.</i>

01:24.852 --> 01:26.852
We have what you call

01:26.854 --> 01:28.454
a problem going on here.

01:28.456 --> 01:30.789
Because, you know what?

01:30.791 --> 01:31.757
We've bingo'd this vault.

01:31.759 --> 01:33.258
Thanks to...

01:33.260 --> 01:34.860
- Thanks to all these people.
- Yeah.

01:34.862 --> 01:36.428
And now we don't know
what to do.

01:36.430 --> 01:38.530
<i>It is the end of a long,</i>

01:38.532 --> 01:41.667
<i>hard day on Oak Island.</i>

01:41.669 --> 01:45.270
<i>A day that saw the emotions
of the Laginas</i>

01:45.272 --> 01:46.772
<i>and their partners</i>

01:46.774 --> 01:48.307
<i>turn from anticipation...</i>

01:48.309 --> 01:49.408
I can't believe

01:49.410 --> 01:51.110
we haven't hit something yet.

01:51.112 --> 01:52.744
It's okay, it's there.

01:52.746 --> 01:54.446
<i>To excitement...</i>

01:54.448 --> 01:55.581
Wood.

01:55.583 --> 01:57.149
Wood!

01:57.151 --> 01:59.218
I'll be damned, look at that.

01:59.220 --> 02:00.886
<i>And then,</i>

02:00.888 --> 02:02.521
<i>to uncertainty.</i>

02:02.523 --> 02:04.756
We found it, let's dig it up.

02:04.758 --> 02:06.458
We need clarity and right now,
we don't have clarity.

02:06.460 --> 02:08.460
We need to proceed slowly.

02:08.461 --> 02:09.661
Rick, it's already been breached

02:09.663 --> 02:11.597
with drill holes, several times.

02:11.599 --> 02:13.365
I know. -We're not gonna
wreck anything.

02:13.367 --> 02:15.400
It's been breached.

02:15.402 --> 02:18.570
<i>After three years
of careful planning,</i>

02:18.572 --> 02:21.773
<i>and an investment
of millions of dollars,</i>

02:21.775 --> 02:25.377
<i>there is reason to believe
that Rick and Marty Lagina,</i>

02:25.379 --> 02:27.579
<i>along with their partners,</i>

02:27.581 --> 02:30.182
<i>may have finally reached
what they believe</i>

02:30.184 --> 02:32.684
<i>to be the so-called
"Chappell Vault,"</i>

02:32.686 --> 02:34.586
<i>the mysterious wooden box</i>

02:34.588 --> 02:36.421
<i>that was first discovered</i>

02:36.423 --> 02:38.891
<i>some 143 feet deep,</i>

02:38.893 --> 02:40.659
<i>beneath the so-called Money Pit,</i>

02:40.661 --> 02:42.861
<i>by treasure hunters
Frederick Blair</i>

02:42.863 --> 02:46.398
<i>and William Chappell in 1897.</i>

02:46.400 --> 02:48.400
<i>I'd be lying if I said
I knew what was in the vault.</i>

02:48.402 --> 02:50.169
<i>I don't know.</i>

02:50.171 --> 02:51.470
I do believe it's something

02:51.472 --> 02:52.738
of significant historical

02:52.740 --> 02:55.207
and archeological importance,

02:55.209 --> 02:57.843
and almost certainly
irreplaceable.

02:57.845 --> 03:01.647
<i>While trying to
determine its contents,</i>

03:01.649 --> 03:05.284
<i>William Chappell drilled
a series of boreholes</i>

03:05.286 --> 03:08.620
<i>which, although filling
the box with mud and seawater,</i>

03:08.622 --> 03:11.657
<i>revealed the presence of gold,</i>

03:11.659 --> 03:15.427
<i>and even a tiny portion
of a handwritten document.</i>

03:15.429 --> 03:17.529
<i>But now,</i>

03:17.531 --> 03:19.665
<i>even though the box was breached</i>

03:19.667 --> 03:21.800
<i>more than a century ago,</i>

03:21.802 --> 03:26.538
<i>Rick and Marty Lagina are
faced with a difficult dilemma:</i>

03:26.540 --> 03:30.676
<i>How to find out if they have
really found the Chappell Vault</i>

03:30.678 --> 03:32.477
<i>without causing further damage</i>

03:32.479 --> 03:35.647
<i>to whatever may be inside.</i>

03:35.649 --> 03:37.583
We're quite sure we're scraping

03:37.585 --> 03:39.318
on horizontal planks of wood.

03:39.320 --> 03:42.354
Everything ties,
it's in the right spot.

03:42.356 --> 03:44.456
But, you know what,

03:44.458 --> 03:45.958
there's a problem nonetheless,

03:45.960 --> 03:49.261
because there's several
different ways we could proceed.

03:49.263 --> 03:50.662
We don't know, folks,

03:50.664 --> 03:53.398
whether we are on a couple of

03:53.400 --> 03:54.666
planks of wood with nothing
beneath them.

03:54.668 --> 03:57.536
It doesn't seem likely,

03:57.538 --> 03:59.238
- but it's possible.
- Yeah.

03:59.240 --> 04:00.839
I mean, does it feel more
like a platform,

04:00.841 --> 04:03.342
or is there no way to tell that?
I think it's safe

04:03.344 --> 04:05.611
to say we feel as though
we certainly are on something.

04:05.613 --> 04:06.612
- Yes.
- Is there any way to tell

04:06.614 --> 04:08.247
if this is a structure

04:08.249 --> 04:09.615
- at all?
- We haven't been able

04:09.617 --> 04:10.882
to hook on so far,

04:10.884 --> 04:13.452
enough to actually
pick something out.

04:13.454 --> 04:14.620
We're just scraping the top.

04:14.622 --> 04:16.488
Are you cutting through it

04:16.490 --> 04:17.856
- with the oscillator?
- No.

04:17.858 --> 04:19.458
Right now, we currently are not.

04:19.459 --> 04:21.326
We're monitoring it very closely

04:21.327 --> 04:22.494
and we can tell that it
wants to build torque,

04:22.496 --> 04:23.962
and wants to cut something.

04:23.964 --> 04:25.797
But the pressures have been
very minimal.

04:25.799 --> 04:29.901
<i>In order to
dig a 40-inch-wide hole</i>

04:29.903 --> 04:33.572
<i>down to a depth of 143 feet,</i>

04:33.574 --> 04:36.375
<i>and still avoid
the maze of flood tunnels</i>

04:36.377 --> 04:38.377
<i>that invade the Money Pit,</i>

04:38.379 --> 04:40.979
<i>the Oak Island team
has been using a system</i>

04:40.981 --> 04:43.849
<i>involving a number of large
steel caissons,</i>

04:43.851 --> 04:46.551
<i>which are literally
ground into the soil</i>

04:46.553 --> 04:48.553
<i>by means of an enormous device</i>

04:48.555 --> 04:50.555
<i>known as an oscillator.</i>

04:50.557 --> 04:53.892
<i>But because the first
drilling caisson</i>

04:53.894 --> 04:56.762
<i>is rimmed with a series
of steel teeth,</i>

04:56.764 --> 05:00.399
<i>which literally rip and tear
their way through the ground,</i>

05:00.401 --> 05:03.368
<i>the team's concern is
that continued drilling</i>

05:03.370 --> 05:05.837
<i>will not only damage
the Chappell Vault,</i>

05:05.839 --> 05:09.074
<i>but may also destroy the
potentially priceless artifacts</i>

05:09.076 --> 05:11.376
<i>it could contain.</i>

05:11.378 --> 05:14.713
<i>Artifacts which some believe
could be everything</i>

05:14.715 --> 05:16.782
<i>from stolen pirate gold</i>

05:16.784 --> 05:19.651
<i>to the lost folios
of William Shakespeare,</i>

05:19.653 --> 05:21.953
<i>and even
the Ark of the Covenant...</i>

05:21.955 --> 05:23.689
<i>The golden chest</i>

05:23.691 --> 05:27.592
<i>that holds the original
Ten Commandments.</i>

05:27.594 --> 05:29.795
If the Oak Island story is real,

05:29.797 --> 05:33.665
there's something very
significant in there,

05:33.667 --> 05:35.467
- and it's irreplaceable.
- Show me proof.

05:35.469 --> 05:36.835
Show me proof.
I say drill a hole

05:36.837 --> 05:37.836
through the thing.

05:37.838 --> 05:40.405
That wouldn't scare me.

05:40.407 --> 05:42.441
I would probably
turn him loose tomorrow

05:42.443 --> 05:44.076
and dig through that thing.

05:44.078 --> 05:45.877
We could continue
to hammer grab.

05:45.879 --> 05:47.713
You know, we could
continue to take

05:47.715 --> 05:50.048
small little bites of wood out,
like we have been doing.

05:50.050 --> 05:51.983
And I know that's
not a preferred option.

05:53.654 --> 05:55.854
I think there's something there.

05:55.856 --> 05:58.623
The caveat, of course,
is if this is a structure.

05:58.625 --> 05:59.958
If this is a structure...

05:59.960 --> 06:01.860
"if."

06:01.862 --> 06:03.962
Oak Island is fraught
with "ifs," as you well know.

06:05.733 --> 06:06.965
I would say, at this juncture,

06:06.967 --> 06:08.367
we got to
make some progress here.

06:08.369 --> 06:09.768
We have to find something.

06:09.770 --> 06:11.069
Are we really gonna destroy

06:11.071 --> 06:12.504
whatever's down there?

06:15.909 --> 06:17.642
You might hear a big difference
here. There's really not.

06:17.644 --> 06:19.511
The difference is
in what are perception is

06:19.513 --> 06:21.480
of what's there.

06:21.482 --> 06:24.516
I believe that it's...
If there's something there,

06:24.518 --> 06:26.151
it's already been flooded
with salt water,

06:26.153 --> 06:27.652
it's already been breached.

06:27.654 --> 06:29.421
And that's the difference,
really.

06:29.423 --> 06:30.522
It's not that we
have a difference in

06:30.524 --> 06:31.690
how we would treat it

06:31.692 --> 06:33.492
if we had the same
mental picture.

06:33.494 --> 06:37.028
I always pictured it as a box
inside of a cavity.

06:37.030 --> 06:39.664
I think it is a void, it's a
void in the sense that...

06:39.666 --> 06:41.867
- But it's filled with soup, now.
- I guess...

06:41.869 --> 06:43.502
I guess I'm thinking
of what could be in there,

06:43.504 --> 06:45.170
and I'm, I'm not there.

06:45.172 --> 06:47.439
Well, it's already got a
hole through it, now.

06:47.441 --> 06:49.875
Yeah, but it's a small hole,
David.

06:49.877 --> 06:51.943
I'd just be concerned
about what, you know,

06:51.945 --> 06:53.812
jeopardizing or compromising

06:53.814 --> 06:56.715
what's in that, you know, vault.

06:56.717 --> 06:58.083
Whatever's in here,

06:58.085 --> 07:00.152
if you keep advancing
down like this,

07:00.154 --> 07:01.186
and grabbing and advancing it,

07:01.188 --> 07:03.555
won't you pick up,

07:03.557 --> 07:06.191
at least, bits and pieces
of whatever this is?

07:06.193 --> 07:07.826
You would damn well hope so.

07:07.828 --> 07:09.795
You would, but we would
fail the struct...

07:09.797 --> 07:12.431
We could fail the structure,
if there is a structure there.

07:12.433 --> 07:14.666
And then,
we could ultimately destroy

07:14.668 --> 07:15.767
whatever we're
trying to seek out.

07:15.769 --> 07:18.069
<i>It's possible</i>

07:18.071 --> 07:19.905
that even though
it has been compromised,

07:19.907 --> 07:21.940
and I totally agree that it has,

07:21.942 --> 07:25.010
it's possible that it's still
quote, unquote intact.

07:25.012 --> 07:27.446
And I don't want to do anything

07:27.448 --> 07:29.114
that may compromise that
further.

07:29.116 --> 07:30.782
There's something there.

07:30.784 --> 07:32.818
That needs some gentle attention
at this point.

07:32.820 --> 07:34.653
We got an airlift

07:34.655 --> 07:36.621
out there now,
so we can draw the water down

07:36.623 --> 07:38.190
and see what the refresh rate
is. Introduce new water,

07:38.192 --> 07:39.591
and try and clear it up,

07:39.593 --> 07:41.126
and get the camera down there.

07:41.128 --> 07:43.728
<i>By pumping air into the shaft</i>

07:43.730 --> 07:45.797
<i>using the airlift method,</i>

07:45.799 --> 07:47.866
<i>the team will be able
to determine</i>

07:47.868 --> 07:50.135
<i>just how quickly the target area</i>

07:50.137 --> 07:53.472
<i>refills with water
from below the ground.</i>

07:53.474 --> 07:55.707
<i>It may also be an effective way</i>

07:55.709 --> 07:58.677
<i>of forcing any possible
contents of the vault</i>

07:58.679 --> 08:01.780
<i>to the surface,
without damaging them.</i>

08:01.782 --> 08:04.983
You know, we could try
and airlift that hole

08:04.985 --> 08:07.152
to see what
the infiltration rate is.

08:07.154 --> 08:09.588
See if we get lucky and bring up
anything that's significant.

08:09.590 --> 08:10.956
Right? Maybe?

08:10.958 --> 08:12.958
I mean, I know
it's gonna be a risk,

08:12.960 --> 08:17.128
but that factor makes it
not as risky, in my mind.

08:17.130 --> 08:19.231
This is ultra-cautious.

08:19.233 --> 08:20.665
This is way more cautious
than I would be,

08:20.667 --> 08:23.735
but I'm not the sole say here.

08:23.737 --> 08:26.905
<i>I have reservations
about how we do this</i>

08:26.907 --> 08:28.240
and I want to proceed slowly.

08:28.242 --> 08:30.175
It's not a matter of
who carries the day,

08:30.177 --> 08:32.177
or what methodically wins out.

08:32.179 --> 08:34.044
It's getting answers.

08:34.047 --> 08:36.581
Okay, I guess that's the plan.

08:36.582 --> 08:37.982
Is that a plan?
Is everybody happy with that?

08:37.985 --> 08:39.851
- Agreed.
- Good.

08:39.852 --> 08:41.553
All right,
I think we're done here.

08:46.226 --> 08:48.293
<i>The next day,</i>

08:48.295 --> 08:49.995
<i>after their meeting
in the War Room,</i>

08:49.997 --> 08:53.798
<i>Rick, Marty
and their partners return</i>

08:53.800 --> 08:55.267
<i>to the Money Pit,</i>

08:55.269 --> 08:56.568
<i>where they will see
if their plan</i>

08:56.570 --> 08:58.570
<i>to use the airlift system</i>

08:58.572 --> 09:00.939
<i>will prove successful.</i>

09:00.941 --> 09:02.207
<i>We want to know
everything about this hole.</i>

09:02.209 --> 09:05.143
<i>One of the things that is</i>

09:05.145 --> 09:08.280
what is the rate of water inflow

09:08.282 --> 09:10.081
if we try to evacuate it?

09:10.083 --> 09:12.150
Just crack it till he says
shut it off,

09:12.152 --> 09:13.952
- and just go slow.
- Yeah.

09:13.954 --> 09:15.820
So we're not gonna run it
very long,

09:15.822 --> 09:17.923
maybe 30 seconds,
we'll see what happens.

09:17.925 --> 09:19.958
Cool? All right.

09:19.960 --> 09:21.192
Here we go.

09:24.030 --> 09:24.996
There she is.

09:24.998 --> 09:26.565
Coming alive!

09:33.173 --> 09:35.874
We think there's almost
3,000 gallons in that hole.

09:35.876 --> 09:37.709
- Right now?
- Yeah.

09:37.711 --> 09:39.744
- Okay.
- I'd say

09:39.746 --> 09:41.680
at least for every gallon you
took out, a gallon came in.

09:41.682 --> 09:45.684
<i>The fact that water is
rushing into the borehole</i>

09:45.686 --> 09:47.052
<i>as fast as Marty and the team</i>

09:47.054 --> 09:49.921
<i>are trying to flush it out,</i>

09:49.923 --> 09:51.656
<i>is not entirely surprising.</i>

09:51.658 --> 09:54.626
You think there's 3,000 gallons in there?
Yes, I do.

09:54.628 --> 09:57.095
<i>Problems caused
by underground water</i>

09:57.097 --> 09:58.830
<i>have plagued treasure hunters</i>

09:58.832 --> 10:00.932
<i>on Oak Island ever since members</i>

10:00.934 --> 10:03.101
<i>of the Onslow Company</i>

10:03.103 --> 10:06.805
<i>dug the original Money Pit
down to a depth of 90 feet</i>

10:06.807 --> 10:09.040
<i>back in 1804.</i>

10:09.042 --> 10:12.143
<i>Upon removing
a large stone slab,</i>

10:12.145 --> 10:14.746
<i>on which were carved
a series of strange,</i>

10:14.748 --> 10:16.247
<i>hieroglyph-like shapes,</i>

10:16.249 --> 10:20.685
<i>the shaft suddenly
filled with seawater,</i>

10:20.687 --> 10:22.187
<i>as if its removal</i>

10:22.189 --> 10:24.990
<i>triggered an underground
booby trap.</i>

10:24.992 --> 10:29.394
<i>It was this same system
that was believed</i>

10:29.396 --> 10:31.096
<i>to have caused the flooding
of the Chappell Vault</i>

10:31.098 --> 10:34.366
<i>in 1897.</i>

10:36.036 --> 10:37.235
I think we should do it again.

10:37.237 --> 10:39.137
I don't think
dropping it 15 feet's

10:39.139 --> 10:40.739
hurting your stability at all.

10:40.741 --> 10:41.773
It's your shaft.

10:41.775 --> 10:44.175
- Andrew!
- Marty!

10:44.177 --> 10:45.410
- Let's go!
- One sec. Ho!

10:45.412 --> 10:46.945
Hit it.

10:54.688 --> 10:58.790
<i>As water is forced out
from within the steel caisson,</i>

10:58.792 --> 11:01.793
<i>there is always a risk
that the change in pressure</i>

11:01.795 --> 11:04.929
<i>around the hole could cause
a catastrophic collapse.</i>

11:06.266 --> 11:07.899
<i>That pipe can take it.</i>

11:07.901 --> 11:09.334
<i>I know what
the collapse resistance is,</i>

11:09.336 --> 11:11.836
<i>and I know what
the collapse pressures are.</i>

11:11.838 --> 11:15.340
<i>So I feel real comfortable
with evacuating that pipe,</i>

11:15.342 --> 11:19.010
that it could be done
from a collapse standpoint.

11:19.012 --> 11:20.211
Minute 30 right there.

11:20.213 --> 11:21.312
- A minute 30?
- Yeah.

11:21.314 --> 11:22.981
Let's go see what, we got going.

11:25.085 --> 11:26.351
How far did it drop?

11:26.353 --> 11:28.286
It came up seven feet.

11:28.288 --> 11:30.422
Yeah. So it took back everything
you just took, plus...

11:30.424 --> 11:32.223
Yeah, and then another foot.

11:32.225 --> 11:36.161
<i>Unfortunately,
the hole is refilling</i>

11:36.163 --> 11:38.997
<i>with underground water
almost as fast</i>

11:38.999 --> 11:40.999
<i>as it's being pumped out.</i>

11:41.001 --> 11:42.701
The amount of water coming in

11:42.703 --> 11:44.903
as we tried to pump it out
was enormous.

11:44.905 --> 11:46.905
Thousands of gallons a minute,
I would say.

11:48.175 --> 11:50.241
<i>The Laginas and their partners</i>

11:50.243 --> 11:53.478
<i>must now face
a sobering reality.</i>

11:53.480 --> 11:56.481
<i>The inability to force water
from the hole means</i>

11:56.483 --> 11:58.850
<i>that they will probably
not be able to bring</i>

11:58.852 --> 12:01.419
<i>any objects or artifacts
up and out of the hole</i>

12:01.421 --> 12:04.422
<i>by means of the airlift method.</i>

12:04.424 --> 12:06.925
So, I would like to do one more.

12:06.927 --> 12:09.094
The good news in everything's stable.
Right.

12:09.096 --> 12:12.197
The bad news in that we probably
didn't bring anything up.

12:12.199 --> 12:14.299
I'd go for five minutes,
try and drop it 30 feet,

12:14.301 --> 12:17.736
check the recharge again,
and then maybe we're done.

12:17.738 --> 12:19.504
Five minutes!

12:19.506 --> 12:22.874
<i>In one final frustrated attempt</i>

12:22.876 --> 12:26.177
<i>to pump the contents
of the so-called Chappell Vault</i>

12:26.179 --> 12:29.881
<i>to the surface, Marty has made
the difficult decision</i>

12:29.883 --> 12:32.517
<i>to increase
the power of the airlift</i>

12:32.519 --> 12:35.520
<i>and run it
for an extended period.</i>

12:35.522 --> 12:37.288
<i>The move is a risky one,</i>

12:37.290 --> 12:40.125
<i>as it adds additional
pressure to the area</i>

12:40.127 --> 12:41.426
<i>surrounding the steel caisson.</i>

12:43.797 --> 12:45.096
- Was that five minutes?
- Yep.

12:48.435 --> 12:51.402
What do we got there now, Kent?

12:51.404 --> 12:56.908
We just put probably, what,
4,000 gallons in there.

12:56.910 --> 13:00.311
What came out of the pipe
was only 15 feet... 900 again.

13:00.313 --> 13:03.081
So 3,000 gallons
came from somewhere else,

13:03.083 --> 13:04.482
in that little bit of time.

13:04.484 --> 13:07.152
We're actually gonna
pull that airlift out

13:07.154 --> 13:08.953
and break it down,
if you guys are good with that.

13:08.955 --> 13:10.321
- I-I think we're done.
- Yeah. We're good.

13:10.323 --> 13:12.390
You know, we know
this is connected

13:12.392 --> 13:15.260
to an enormous source of water.

13:15.262 --> 13:16.961
The fact that it's coming in
at an enormous rate

13:16.963 --> 13:19.130
just verifies that we're
connected to the ocean,

13:19.132 --> 13:21.432
which, you know, if you're
a believer in the flood tunnel,

13:21.434 --> 13:25.270
is yet another check mark
to say, "This is it."

13:25.272 --> 13:28.273
<i>But now the Laginas
have a difficult</i>

13:28.275 --> 13:31.276
<i>and potentially risky
decision to make.</i>

13:31.278 --> 13:33.812
<i>If they cannot force objects
from the vault</i>

13:33.814 --> 13:35.914
<i>up to the surface,</i>

13:35.916 --> 13:38.983
<i>they need to find another way
to retrieve them.</i>

13:38.985 --> 13:40.585
Look, we're not gonna sit on it.

13:40.587 --> 13:43.521
The dilemma here is whether
or not to grab

13:43.523 --> 13:45.390
a large amount
of whatever's in there,

13:45.392 --> 13:48.560
or to surgically remove
some material.

13:48.562 --> 13:52.163
Do an arthroscopic surgery now.

13:52.165 --> 13:55.200
I-I'd rather do that
than brain surgery

13:55.202 --> 13:57.836
with a pair of pliers
blindfolded.

13:57.838 --> 13:58.970
Well, I'm all for surgical.

13:58.972 --> 14:01.139
Then great. Decision made.

14:01.141 --> 14:02.407
I guess we'd like to...

14:02.409 --> 14:03.541
Continue hammer grabbing.

14:03.543 --> 14:05.310
Yeah.

14:05.311 --> 14:07.078
Just two inches.
You can go two inches.

14:07.080 --> 14:09.848
Kind of get back to where
you're scraping wood again.

14:09.850 --> 14:12.016
I'm gonna go check
that measurement and get back.

14:12.018 --> 14:15.186
At some point,
you're gonna be very happy.

14:15.188 --> 14:17.088
I'll be happy if you're happy,
big brother.

14:17.090 --> 14:19.224
That's what would
make me happiest.

14:21.127 --> 14:23.228
<i>Although hammer grabbing</i>

14:23.230 --> 14:25.496
<i>will be effective
in getting more wood</i>

14:25.498 --> 14:29.634
<i>and perhaps other materials
out of the Valley Three hole,</i>

14:29.636 --> 14:33.504
<i>it could also damage or destroy
whatever lies within</i>

14:33.506 --> 14:36.507
<i>the so-called Chappell Vault.</i>

14:36.509 --> 14:38.977
<i>Plan was to scoop out</i>

14:38.979 --> 14:41.079
<i>the last little bit
of fill in there,</i>

14:41.081 --> 14:43.248
which would give us
plenty of time to do this

14:43.250 --> 14:46.050
noninvasive investigation
in this hole.

14:47.520 --> 14:50.021
Okay. Let's drop it in,
see what happens. -Yeah.

14:52.459 --> 14:55.193
Here we go.

14:55.195 --> 14:57.228
<i>If the structural
integrity of it has been</i>

14:57.230 --> 14:59.330
<i>severely compromised,</i>

14:59.332 --> 15:03.067
<i>maybe we do have to
retrieve it in piecemeal.</i>

15:06.273 --> 15:09.173
<i>My perfect world scenario
would be</i>

15:09.175 --> 15:12.143
we gingerly set down on it

15:12.145 --> 15:15.546
and it grabs
just something that says,

15:15.548 --> 15:17.982
"Here you go. It's real."

15:17.984 --> 15:20.018
Something that's
kind of interesting,

15:20.020 --> 15:22.320
and it just started happening
as of late,

15:22.322 --> 15:23.521
- you can feel when it strikes.
- Really?

15:23.523 --> 15:24.956
Which we haven't felt before.

15:29.529 --> 15:31.129
Does that mean, wood?

15:31.131 --> 15:33.164
It could possibly
be something hollow.

15:33.166 --> 15:34.198
- Sure. Hell yeah.
- Yeah.

15:41.207 --> 15:44.409
<i>Suddenly,
as the hammer grab is extracted</i>

15:44.411 --> 15:45.543
<i>from the steel caisson...</i>

15:45.545 --> 15:47.412
My goodness.

15:47.414 --> 15:49.614
<i>It is obvious
that it has done much more</i>

15:49.616 --> 15:51.716
<i>than pick up loose debris.</i>

15:51.718 --> 15:53.685
That ain't good.

15:59.626 --> 16:01.526
<i>I just can't believe it.</i>

16:01.528 --> 16:03.394
Wow.

16:03.396 --> 16:05.229
I'm choosing to be impressed.

16:05.231 --> 16:07.382
Absolutely.

16:07.383 --> 16:09.534
<i>Although the
hammer grab was only intended</i>

16:09.536 --> 16:11.970
<i>to skim the surface of
the underground structure</i>

16:11.972 --> 16:14.305
<i>discovered at Valley Three,</i>

16:14.307 --> 16:18.109
<i>it has brought up
several large chunks of wood.</i>

16:23.550 --> 16:26.184
<i>After a brief inspection,</i>

16:26.186 --> 16:28.319
<i>it becomes obvious
that what Rick,</i>

16:28.321 --> 16:31.456
<i>Marty and their partners
have discovered is</i>

16:31.458 --> 16:33.758
<i>the very same wooden structure
they found</i>

16:33.760 --> 16:36.661
<i>and took a core sample from
two years ago.</i>

16:36.663 --> 16:39.197
You core it from a hole

16:39.199 --> 16:40.665
that's wandering off,
and then you put

16:40.667 --> 16:42.600
this big can down
and you get it.

16:42.602 --> 16:43.768
Man, did we bingo that!

16:43.770 --> 16:46.404
I mean, come on,
that's pretty impressive.

16:46.406 --> 16:49.540
<i>I am extremely gratified
from a technical standpoint.</i>

16:49.542 --> 16:51.042
I mean, we did it right.

16:51.044 --> 16:52.343
We took our measurements right,

16:52.345 --> 16:55.113
and we came down vertical
right over this thing.

16:55.115 --> 16:57.415
You know, that's gratifying,
'cause that wasn't easy.

16:57.417 --> 16:59.484
What does the other side
of this one look like, Rick?

16:59.486 --> 17:03.388
<i>But as impressive
as the discovery is,</i>

17:03.390 --> 17:06.523
<i>the team is concerned that the
hammer grab may have damaged</i>

17:06.526 --> 17:09.560
<i>not only what they hope
is the Chappell Vault,</i>

17:09.561 --> 17:13.464
<i>but whatever contents
the vault may contain.</i>

17:13.465 --> 17:15.500
I'd say we kind of up the...

17:15.502 --> 17:16.768
surgically removing it,
didn't we? -

17:16.770 --> 17:18.669
No! Initially,
I thought that, David,

17:18.671 --> 17:20.771
but we didn't bash it down.

17:20.773 --> 17:22.473
We just opened the hatch, man.

17:22.474 --> 17:24.342
Now we got to decide
what this means.

17:24.344 --> 17:26.310
I think we should know
absolutely

17:26.311 --> 17:27.512
what we're looking at.

17:27.513 --> 17:29.781
Well, I say let's take
another grab

17:29.783 --> 17:32.050
- and see what we come up with.
- I mean, we have a shot.

17:32.052 --> 17:34.218
It's worth a shot to take
something down and take a look.

17:34.220 --> 17:36.587
I mean, it's open now, right?

17:36.589 --> 17:39.323
And that gives you a little more
insight as to how to proceed.

17:39.325 --> 17:43.628
Go down once more,
very gingerly, and...

17:43.630 --> 17:45.329
I mean, at this point.

17:45.331 --> 17:48.299
<i>Some of the potential ways</i>

17:48.301 --> 17:51.335
<i>to proceed are now eliminated,
because the die has been cast.</i>

17:51.337 --> 17:53.404
<i>The top has been pulled off.</i>

17:53.406 --> 17:56.674
So, we're still going
to proceed with caution,

17:56.676 --> 17:58.843
<i>but we want to look
in there somehow.</i>

17:58.845 --> 18:01.079
You're gonna want to probe,
I know you are.

18:01.081 --> 18:02.547
So let's go probe.

18:05.118 --> 18:07.151
<i>Because the wooden
structure has already been</i>

18:07.153 --> 18:08.753
<i>accidentally breached,</i>

18:08.755 --> 18:11.689
<i>the Oak Island team
has no choice</i>

18:11.691 --> 18:15.359
<i>but to send the hammer grab
down the hole a second time,</i>

18:15.361 --> 18:17.728
<i>in an attempt
to retrieve any artifacts</i>

18:17.730 --> 18:19.764
<i>that may be contained within it.</i>

18:22.135 --> 18:25.203
<i>It's a proper plan,
because whether it's</i>

18:25.205 --> 18:28.172
<i>fully compromised, whether the
structural integrity remains,</i>

18:28.174 --> 18:32.243
I want to prove to my own
satisfaction whether or not

18:32.245 --> 18:35.313
<i>something is down there.</i>

18:35.315 --> 18:37.315
<i>Could the contents
of the next hammer grab</i>

18:37.317 --> 18:40.718
<i>contain the final clue
to the Oak Island puzzle,</i>

18:40.720 --> 18:43.821
<i>the one generations
of treasure hunters</i>

18:43.823 --> 18:48.292
<i>have been trying to find
for more than 200 years?</i>

18:48.294 --> 18:51.529
<i>We need answers, and so</i>

18:51.531 --> 18:53.531
we anticipate what's there.

18:53.533 --> 18:55.093
You know, we're on the edge
of our seat.

19:00.707 --> 19:02.240
Boy, look at that thing.

19:04.244 --> 19:06.310
Nice grab.

19:06.312 --> 19:09.480
<i>Have Rick, Marty
and the Oak Island team</i>

19:09.482 --> 19:13.284
<i>finally come face-to-face
with an actual section</i>

19:13.286 --> 19:14.819
<i>of the legendary
Chappell Vault...</i>

19:14.821 --> 19:17.622
Looks like clay
between the two pieces of wood.

19:17.624 --> 19:20.358
<i>The mysterious wooden structure</i>

19:20.360 --> 19:23.394
<i>which was first discovered
and then lost</i>

19:23.396 --> 19:25.930
<i>more than 100 years ago?</i>

19:25.932 --> 19:27.565
That's quite some clay, Marty?

19:27.567 --> 19:28.833
That's incredible.

19:28.835 --> 19:30.869
<i>The excitement level</i>

19:30.870 --> 19:32.904
just gets higher,
because the two pieces of timber

19:32.906 --> 19:35.473
are the exact thickness,
the correct thickness,

19:35.475 --> 19:37.909
as described
in the previous records,

19:37.911 --> 19:41.412
<i>and they look ancient,
so everything looks perfect.</i>

19:41.414 --> 19:42.847
I think that's oak.

19:42.849 --> 19:44.649
Isn't that something?

19:44.651 --> 19:47.618
<i>According to historical records,</i>

19:47.620 --> 19:49.754
<i>the so-called Chappell Vault</i>

19:49.756 --> 19:52.490
<i>was estimated to be
seven feet high</i>

19:52.492 --> 19:54.759
<i>and was constructed
of oak timbers,</i>

19:54.761 --> 19:57.428
<i>each seven inches thick.</i>

19:57.430 --> 19:58.930
<i>It sure seems to be the vault,</i>

19:58.932 --> 20:02.767
<i>because the timbers
look very ancient.</i>

20:02.769 --> 20:05.203
They're the right thickness.

20:05.205 --> 20:08.306
And I walk up to it
and I think, "What's that?"

20:08.308 --> 20:10.508
Are we seeing saw marks
on there?

20:10.510 --> 20:11.676
Yeah.

20:13.813 --> 20:17.315
- What does that mean?
- I don't know.

20:17.317 --> 20:18.950
That is odd.

20:18.952 --> 20:21.452
- Both directions?
- Both directions.

20:21.454 --> 20:24.255
I see it cutting this way
and cutting this way.

20:24.257 --> 20:27.258
<i>They're circular saw marks,</i>

20:27.260 --> 20:30.561
and my heart drops
to the bottom of my stomach

20:30.563 --> 20:33.731
because I'm pretty sure

20:33.733 --> 20:36.567
that the circular saw
for milling timber

20:36.569 --> 20:39.937
is a relatively new invention.

20:39.939 --> 20:41.672
I see the marks.

20:41.674 --> 20:44.709
Yeah, well, that would be
a circular saw cutting.

20:44.711 --> 20:47.979
<i>The presence of
circular saw marks on the wood</i>

20:47.981 --> 20:52.383
<i>may offer an unwelcome bit
of bad news,</i>

20:52.385 --> 20:55.753
<i>because if the wooden structure
the team has located</i>

20:55.755 --> 20:57.989
<i>in the Money Pit is
the Chappell Vault,</i>

20:57.991 --> 21:00.958
<i>how could it have been made
utilizing a tool</i>

21:00.960 --> 21:03.928
<i>that was not widely used
in North America</i>

21:03.930 --> 21:06.530
<i>until the early 19th century?</i>

21:06.532 --> 21:08.899
If that really is
a circular saw,

21:08.901 --> 21:11.702
then it's surely not 1600.

21:11.704 --> 21:14.305
Correct.

21:14.307 --> 21:16.507
What I would do is
go down and see Dan.

21:16.509 --> 21:18.442
Yeah, we'll do that.

21:18.444 --> 21:20.945
It's actually classic
Oak Island, right?

21:20.947 --> 21:22.880
We thought everything
was lining out,

21:22.882 --> 21:25.049
<i>but we see it with our own eye</i>

21:25.051 --> 21:28.486
<i>and it's distinctly
and uniquely troubling.</i>

21:28.488 --> 21:29.887
- You want another grab?
- I think we're done.

21:29.889 --> 21:31.789
- Kill it?
- Yeah.

21:31.791 --> 21:34.325
'Shell, that's it.

21:37.597 --> 21:39.030
Look, we got to go
where the evidence takes us.

21:39.032 --> 21:40.631
Of course we do.

21:40.633 --> 21:42.366
And we can't let the island
keep beating us.

21:42.368 --> 21:43.668
No.

21:43.670 --> 21:44.769
We got to kick her
in the ass once.

21:44.771 --> 21:46.604
Yep.

21:46.606 --> 21:47.538
Okay, I'll be back.

21:47.540 --> 21:48.540
Okay, Rick.

21:51.511 --> 21:53.944
<i>With the excavation
of the Valley Three shaft</i>

21:53.946 --> 21:58.316
<i>temporarily halted,
Marty Lagina's son, Alex,</i>

21:58.318 --> 22:00.318
<i>along with Jack Begley,</i>

22:00.320 --> 22:03.421
<i>have brought metal-detection
expert Gary Drayton</i>

22:03.423 --> 22:08.459
<i>to the area on the island
known as "Lot 6."</i>

22:08.461 --> 22:13.331
<i>It is also one of the lots
once owned by Samuel Ball,</i>

22:13.333 --> 22:17.668
<i>a former American slave
who once lived on Oak Island.</i>

22:17.670 --> 22:18.936
So this is the property line
right here.

22:18.938 --> 22:20.538
Okay.

22:20.540 --> 22:21.572
What do you say, about 20 feet?

22:21.574 --> 22:23.374
Right in here would be,

22:23.376 --> 22:24.656
probably, a good place to start.

22:26.412 --> 22:28.346
Let's see if
the first target of the day

22:28.348 --> 22:29.880
could be a Spanish coin.

22:29.882 --> 22:32.383
Cross your fingers.

22:32.385 --> 22:33.884
<i>Having traveled to Oak Island</i>

22:33.886 --> 22:35.720
<i>from his home in Florida,</i>

22:35.722 --> 22:39.090
<i>Gary Drayton brings over
25 years of experience</i>

22:39.092 --> 22:42.693
<i>detecting near-surface
artifacts and treasure.</i>

22:42.695 --> 22:44.128
Is that a good hit?

22:44.130 --> 22:46.797
Yeah, that's a good hit.
All right.

22:46.799 --> 22:49.800
<i>Over the years, he has recovered</i>

22:49.802 --> 22:52.069
<i>more than $1 million worth
of everything</i>

22:52.071 --> 22:54.438
<i>from ancient jewelry and coins</i>

22:54.440 --> 22:56.774
<i>to priceless historic artifacts.</i>

22:58.378 --> 22:59.710
Wow, straight on it.

22:59.712 --> 23:00.978
- It's a nail.
- Yeah.

23:00.980 --> 23:02.880
Okay, so let's keep looking.

23:05.585 --> 23:09.120
<i>Using the Minelab.</i>

23:09.122 --> 23:13.624
<i>Gary will be able to detect
up to three feet underground.</i>

23:13.626 --> 23:15.760
<i>He will also be able
to distinguish</i>

23:15.762 --> 23:18.429
<i>between ferrous metals,
such as iron,</i>

23:18.431 --> 23:22.032
<i>and non-ferrous metals,
such as gold or silver.</i>

23:24.604 --> 23:26.837
Wow, I'm getting targets
all over here.

23:26.839 --> 23:29.707
Yeah?

23:29.709 --> 23:30.875
Wow.

23:30.877 --> 23:33.010
Yeah, there's a big hit.

23:34.747 --> 23:36.180
- Right there?
- I think we should start here.

23:36.182 --> 23:44.182
- All right.
- Dig it up, Jack.

23:49.028 --> 23:51.028
Dan?

23:51.030 --> 23:52.563
Come on in!

23:52.565 --> 23:53.764
Got something to show you here.

23:53.766 --> 23:57.201
- Yes, you have.
- Yep.

23:57.203 --> 23:58.669
Don't know how important it is,

23:58.671 --> 24:00.137
and don't know
the relevance of it,

24:00.139 --> 24:02.473
and that's why we're here.

24:02.475 --> 24:04.175
<i>If anyone on the island</i>

24:04.177 --> 24:07.445
<i>might be able to identify
the strange pieces of wood</i>

24:07.447 --> 24:09.213
<i>the team recovered
earlier this morning</i>

24:09.215 --> 24:13.451
<i>at the Valley Three borehole,
it's Dan Blankenship.</i>

24:13.453 --> 24:15.586
<i>He has lived on the island,</i>

24:15.588 --> 24:17.855
<i>and been searching it
for treasure,</i>

24:17.857 --> 24:19.990
<i>for more than half a century.</i>

24:19.992 --> 24:21.659
What do you have, Rick?

24:21.661 --> 24:26.130
Well, the caisson is down
to about 142 and change.

24:26.132 --> 24:30.634
This item came up
inside the casing.

24:30.636 --> 24:32.236
Yeah.

24:32.238 --> 24:34.038
We think that that's the core.

24:34.040 --> 24:35.973
Yeah.

24:35.975 --> 24:37.842
That's pretty good indication

24:37.844 --> 24:39.176
that you're in the right spot.

24:39.178 --> 24:41.779
- Right.
- Here's the thing, Dan.

24:41.781 --> 24:44.548
We're trying to figure out
what these marks are.

24:45.985 --> 24:49.753
Definitely saw marks.

24:49.755 --> 24:53.591
Probably about
a three-foot circular blade.

24:55.795 --> 24:57.862
This wood here
would have been made

24:57.864 --> 25:00.898
somewhere after 1750, we'll say.

25:00.900 --> 25:02.666
Right.

25:02.668 --> 25:04.635
So do you think
this is searcher,

25:04.637 --> 25:07.104
as opposed to
original depositor?

25:07.106 --> 25:11.242
In all probability,
just by the texture of it,

25:11.244 --> 25:15.112
it's probably part
of Chappell's shaft.

25:15.114 --> 25:17.581
<i>Chappell's Shaft?</i>

25:17.583 --> 25:22.119
<i>In 1931, more than three
decades after the location</i>

25:22.121 --> 25:25.823
<i>of the "Chappell Vault" was
lost due to a cave-in,</i>

25:25.825 --> 25:29.793
<i>William Chappell's son,
Melbourne, began constructing</i>

25:29.795 --> 25:32.530
<i>a lateral, or horizontal tunnel</i>

25:32.532 --> 25:34.164
<i>leading in the last-known
direction</i>

25:34.166 --> 25:37.301
<i>of his father's historic find.</i>

25:37.303 --> 25:41.005
<i>Unfortunately, Chappell was
only able to build</i>

25:41.007 --> 25:44.074
<i>about ten feet of his tunnel
before being plagued</i>

25:44.076 --> 25:48.245
<i>by a series of underground
cave-ins due to flooding.</i>

25:48.247 --> 25:52.283
<i>Is it possible that Rick,
Marty, and the team have found</i>

25:52.285 --> 25:54.718
<i>not the legendary
"Chappell Vault,"</i>

25:54.720 --> 25:58.989
<i>but Mel Chappell's abandoned
searcher tunnel?</i>

25:58.991 --> 26:02.793
<i>It now appears that Oak Island
has once again</i>

26:02.795 --> 26:06.297
<i>played a cruel trick
on those who seek to uncover</i>

26:06.299 --> 26:08.899
<i>its centuries-old mystery.</i>

26:08.901 --> 26:12.636
<i>The target that Rick, Marty,
and the team have been</i>

26:12.638 --> 26:14.138
<i>so eager to reach,</i>

26:14.140 --> 26:16.340
<i>and have had such
high hopes for,</i>

26:16.342 --> 26:18.709
<i>is not the Chappell vault.</i>

26:18.711 --> 26:22.846
<i>They will now have to decide
whether to dig deeper</i>

26:22.848 --> 26:25.316
<i>or begin excavating
their second planned hole</i>

26:25.318 --> 26:27.918
<i>at the Money Pit.</i>

26:27.920 --> 26:30.120
Unfortunately, I think we have
some information, Charles,

26:30.122 --> 26:32.856
that we need to relate
to everybody up top.

26:32.858 --> 26:34.224
- Okay, we're gonna go.
- Yeah.

26:34.226 --> 26:36.026
Well, thanks for the info, Dan.

26:36.028 --> 26:38.228
Yeah. I'm gonna give you
my honest opinion,

26:38.230 --> 26:39.196
whether you like it or not.

26:39.198 --> 26:40.864
That's all we want.

26:40.866 --> 26:42.766
That's the one thing
I absolutely know

26:42.768 --> 26:44.969
I can count on, Dan.

26:44.971 --> 26:45.903
- Okay, thanks, Dan.
- Thanks, Dan.

26:45.905 --> 26:47.104
Still got your work

26:47.106 --> 26:48.706
- cut out ahead of you.
- Yep.

26:54.780 --> 26:56.880
Well, I'm getting
targets all over here.

26:56.882 --> 26:57.982
Yeah?

26:57.984 --> 27:00.117
<i>Back on Lot 6,</i>

27:00.119 --> 27:03.020
<i>Gary Drayton is continuing
to get numerous hits</i>

27:03.022 --> 27:04.855
<i>from his metal detector.</i>

27:04.857 --> 27:06.757
I think we should start here.

27:06.759 --> 27:09.193
<i>This is most likely proof</i>

27:09.195 --> 27:11.061
<i>that the area the team
is searching</i>

27:11.063 --> 27:14.031
<i>was once a place
of human activity.</i>

27:14.033 --> 27:16.393
You got other hits over here.
Should we look over here, too?

27:19.405 --> 27:22.406
Yeah, just there.
It's under there.

27:22.408 --> 27:23.941
Well, you think it's connected,

27:23.943 --> 27:25.042
or just some
of the same sort of stuff?

27:25.044 --> 27:26.677
It's the same kind of stuff.

27:26.679 --> 27:29.980
Let me try and open this area up
a little more.

27:33.219 --> 27:35.886
Well, I'm getting targets
all over here.

27:35.888 --> 27:37.921
- That's a good sign.
- Yeah.

27:39.792 --> 27:42.092
- Whoa, Alex!
- What?

27:42.094 --> 27:44.228
I saw something move in there.

27:45.965 --> 27:48.098
Wow, look at that!

27:48.100 --> 27:50.334
- It's a chain.
- Is it?

27:50.336 --> 27:52.369
Yeah, it's got the round eye.

27:52.371 --> 27:54.772
Does it look like
a logging chain?

27:54.774 --> 27:57.041
Yeah, I don't know.
It looks really old, though.

27:57.043 --> 27:58.342
Or a nautical chain.

27:58.344 --> 28:02.246
Um, it's tough to tell.

28:02.248 --> 28:05.416
Back in the day,
the old pirates and stuff,

28:05.418 --> 28:07.251
when they used to bury treasure,

28:07.253 --> 28:09.687
they used to lay a chain

28:09.689 --> 28:11.722
so they could follow the chain

28:11.724 --> 28:13.323
- to the treasure, yeah.
- What? Really?

28:13.325 --> 28:15.225
I know it sounds crazy,
but yeah.

28:15.227 --> 28:18.896
<i>A piece of chain,
found on property</i>

28:18.898 --> 28:22.132
<i>that once belonged
to Samuel Ball?</i>

28:22.134 --> 28:26.737
<i>In 1776, Samuel Ball was</i>

28:26.739 --> 28:29.907
<i>an 11-year-old American slave.</i>

28:29.909 --> 28:33.377
<i>After running away from the
South Carolina plantation,</i>

28:33.379 --> 28:37.081
<i>where he was forced to work,
he made his way to New York,</i>

28:37.083 --> 28:39.817
<i>where he promised to fight
for the British cause</i>

28:39.819 --> 28:42.252
<i>in exchange for his freedom.</i>

28:42.254 --> 28:47.191
<i>In 1786, the young man moved
to Nova Scotia,</i>

28:47.193 --> 28:50.060
<i>where he eventually purchased
a four-acre lot of land</i>

28:50.062 --> 28:51.962
<i>on Oak Island.</i>

28:53.499 --> 28:55.966
<i>Although Ball was known
to his neighbors</i>

28:55.968 --> 28:58.469
<i>as a simple cabbage farmer,</i>

28:58.471 --> 29:01.805
<i>at the time of his death
in 1845,</i>

29:01.807 --> 29:03.173
<i>he was revealed to be</i>

29:03.175 --> 29:06.043
<i>one of the richest men
in the area,</i>

29:06.045 --> 29:09.446
<i>owning a total of 36 acres
on Oak Island,</i>

29:09.448 --> 29:12.783
<i>and several more
on the mainland.</i>

29:14.253 --> 29:17.020
- Hey, guys.
- Hey, Charles.

29:17.022 --> 29:18.922
- Just in time.
- What'd you find?

29:18.924 --> 29:20.224
Check it out.
We got an old chain here.

29:20.226 --> 29:22.159
- Yeah.
- Really?

29:22.161 --> 29:23.894
Don't you think it's weird

29:23.896 --> 29:25.462
how it's in a straight line?

29:25.464 --> 29:27.297
Wouldn't you think
it would all be in one...

29:27.299 --> 29:28.932
- Like just clumped up together.
- Yeah.

29:28.934 --> 29:31.435
I'm just trying to expose
this end of it.

29:31.437 --> 29:33.403
- There's a little bit there.
- Right, right.

29:33.405 --> 29:35.439
I'm hoping
it's a treasure chest.

29:35.441 --> 29:38.509
I'm hoping you're right.

29:38.511 --> 29:41.378
<i>Could Gary Drayton and
members of the Oak Island team</i>

29:41.380 --> 29:44.448
<i>have found an important piece
of historic evidence?</i>

29:44.450 --> 29:46.416
- It's a hook.
- It's a hook.

29:46.418 --> 29:49.186
<i>One that could explain
how Samuel Ball was able</i>

29:49.188 --> 29:52.356
<i>to acquire his vast wealth?</i>

29:52.358 --> 29:54.892
- There it is.
- Tag it and bag it.

29:54.894 --> 29:57.060
Okay.

29:57.062 --> 29:59.463
Well, it was a nice try.

29:59.465 --> 30:02.032
But we'll keep going
in a straight line.

30:09.241 --> 30:10.941
And that's
a nice-looking one, too.

30:10.943 --> 30:12.442
Yeah.

30:12.444 --> 30:14.478
- There's something.
- That sounds like a good target.

30:14.480 --> 30:16.313
- Yeah, it does.
- You hear that tone?

30:16.315 --> 30:18.949
- It's not iron, right?
- No, it's not iron.

30:18.951 --> 30:21.084
- Well, that's good.
- Mid-tone.

30:21.086 --> 30:24.254
If I was guessing,
I would say it was a coin.

30:24.256 --> 30:27.224
It's, eight or nine inches down

30:27.226 --> 30:29.459
under the center
of the search coil.

30:41.507 --> 30:44.107
Directly under the center.
It may be pinpointed, Jack.

30:44.109 --> 30:46.610
Please, be a Spanish coin.

30:49.181 --> 30:50.614
Here it is.

30:50.616 --> 30:53.884
- Wow.
- What is this?

30:56.121 --> 31:02.159
It looks like a ring!

31:02.161 --> 31:06.263
<i>On Lot 6,
near the middle of Oak Island,</i>

31:06.265 --> 31:09.099
<i>on land once owned
by a former American slave,</i>

31:09.101 --> 31:12.169
<i>turned wealthy landowner
named Samuel Ball...</i>

31:12.171 --> 31:14.504
I think it's copper.

31:14.506 --> 31:16.106
<i>Members of the Oak Island team</i>

31:16.108 --> 31:18.242
<i>along with metal detection
expert,</i>

31:18.244 --> 31:21.478
<i>Gary Drayton, have just
made an interesting,</i>

31:21.480 --> 31:24.147
<i>and perhaps significant,
discovery.</i>

31:24.149 --> 31:26.550
We'll take it. -Well,
see. See if it fits, Alex.

31:26.552 --> 31:28.051
Pretty irregular.

31:28.053 --> 31:29.920
- What do you think?
- Yes,

31:29.922 --> 31:32.155
I do.

31:32.157 --> 31:33.357
<i>Sure enough,</i>

31:33.359 --> 31:35.425
<i>we pulled up a really old ring.</i>

31:35.427 --> 31:37.160
<i>It's like a copper,</i>

31:37.162 --> 31:40.230
bronze, and real deep
in the ground.

31:40.232 --> 31:42.266
Over a foot, at least.

31:42.268 --> 31:44.668
<i>It had been sitting
under this root of a tree</i>

31:44.670 --> 31:47.905
<i>for probably over 200 years.</i>

31:47.907 --> 31:50.340
<i>It's real exciting.
We know we're in</i>

31:50.342 --> 31:53.176
the right spot
to find more really old hits.

31:53.178 --> 31:55.078
Next is the chest.

31:55.080 --> 31:56.546
I'm thinking positive.

31:56.548 --> 31:58.382
- Yeah!
- I'm here to find some treasure.

31:58.384 --> 31:59.483
Things are picking up.

32:04.423 --> 32:07.524
<i>We're in an area
that has been unexplored,</i>

32:07.526 --> 32:10.594
<i>especially by someone
as talented as Gary, and</i>

32:10.596 --> 32:13.263
it's boosted our
morale to the point to where

32:13.265 --> 32:16.099
we're ready to just
keep digging and digging.

32:19.305 --> 32:21.238
- Nothing so far?
- No.

32:24.209 --> 32:28.111
All it takes is one good target.

32:33.352 --> 32:36.553
Yeah. There's a lot
of iron in this area,

32:36.555 --> 32:40.157
which means people have been
there. Man-made stuff.

32:42.094 --> 32:44.695
- That's not iron.
- Yeah, it has good sound.

32:46.398 --> 32:48.131
Yep, straight in the middle.

32:50.402 --> 32:52.970
<i>Gary gets, what he thinks</i>

32:52.972 --> 32:54.404
is possibly an exciting hit.

32:54.406 --> 32:55.572
<i>And he thought it was great</i>

32:55.574 --> 32:57.374
<i>because it was so deep.</i>

32:57.376 --> 32:59.643
<i>I started getting down there</i>

32:59.645 --> 33:01.345
<i>and digging a bunch of dirt up.</i>

33:01.347 --> 33:03.480
<i>So, dirty as heck, but</i>

33:03.482 --> 33:05.248
we're sticking to our guns.

33:05.250 --> 33:06.530
- You want to check?
- All right.

33:08.487 --> 33:10.420
That's a good target.
You got it, Jack.

33:10.422 --> 33:12.356
- See how good it sounds now?
- Yeah!

33:12.358 --> 33:15.425
We got clearer readings,
it's not moving around.

33:15.427 --> 33:19.296
Hopefully, it's something good.

33:19.298 --> 33:22.599
- It's a coin.
- It's a coin!

33:22.601 --> 33:24.568
We've got a coin!

33:24.570 --> 33:26.370
<i>A coin?</i>

33:26.372 --> 33:28.038
<i>Could it possibly be one</i>

33:28.040 --> 33:29.439
<i>that was once in the possession</i>

33:29.441 --> 33:31.241
<i>of Samuel Ball?</i>

33:31.243 --> 33:33.143
<i>Perhaps even one he found</i>

33:33.145 --> 33:36.179
<i>while searching
for treasure on Oak Island?</i>

33:36.181 --> 33:38.448
A face on that side.

33:38.450 --> 33:40.450
Now, that's exciting.

33:40.452 --> 33:42.419
- Way to go, Jack.
- Good job.

33:42.421 --> 33:43.520
Way to go, all of us.

33:45.224 --> 33:47.457
Can you see any milling
around the edge,

33:47.459 --> 33:50.127
the little, little lines
around the edge?

33:50.129 --> 33:52.796
They milled the coins
because it was made in a press.

33:55.267 --> 33:59.036
You see a little milling around the edge?
Yeah. It is.

33:59.038 --> 34:01.638
So, it's, you know, could be
up to 200 years old,

34:01.640 --> 34:03.507
- over 200 years old.
- Wow.

34:03.509 --> 34:05.208
- Great find.
- Way to go.

34:05.210 --> 34:06.510
What we're gonna have to do

34:06.512 --> 34:08.277
- is recheck this area.
- Yeah.

34:08.280 --> 34:11.148
And go in spirals just
in case there's some more.

34:11.150 --> 34:14.317
Yeah. -Unless you'd
rather dig some more nails.

34:14.319 --> 34:16.620
- Well, those are my favorite.
- No? We're happy with the coin.

34:16.621 --> 34:18.355
You know, what I would
like to do, if you don't mind,

34:18.357 --> 34:20.424
just dig this out
a little bit more,

34:20.426 --> 34:22.492
because you never know,
there might be some...

34:22.494 --> 34:24.728
- another coin.
- You mean, widen the hole?

34:24.730 --> 34:26.530
Hey, guys.

34:26.532 --> 34:28.697
What'd you find, Gary?

34:28.699 --> 34:31.101
A coin, just the wrong color.

34:31.103 --> 34:34.071
I'm still looking
for that gold-colored coin.

34:34.072 --> 34:35.833
I'm hoping you're going
to find the gold one.

34:38.110 --> 34:39.810
Here's a coin.

34:39.812 --> 34:42.312
Nice.

34:42.313 --> 34:44.281
And then, Jack

34:44.283 --> 34:45.815
found a ring.

34:45.818 --> 34:47.784
- Here?
- Yeah, look at...

34:47.786 --> 34:50.253
- Just over there.
- Way to go, Jack.

34:53.125 --> 34:55.759
- What do you make of that?
- If we're finding

34:55.761 --> 34:57.861
copper rings, copper coins,

34:57.863 --> 35:02.165
I'm sure there's other
items we can find.

35:02.167 --> 35:05.135
So, this is a hot little
area you've put us in, Rick.

35:05.137 --> 35:07.370
I'd love to watch you
find a gold one.

35:07.372 --> 35:09.272
I, I want that big grin
on your face.

35:09.274 --> 35:12.676
- And see my gold dance.
- Exactly.

35:12.678 --> 35:15.178
I don't want to spoil it, but...

35:15.180 --> 35:19.149
<i>Although today began
with disappointing news</i>

35:19.151 --> 35:22.319
<i>for Rick, Marty
and the Oak Island team,</i>

35:22.321 --> 35:25.555
<i>the small but potentially
significant items</i>

35:25.557 --> 35:27.858
<i>found on Samuel Ball's property</i>

35:27.860 --> 35:31.428
<i>offer hope that bigger
discoveries still lie ahead.</i>

35:31.430 --> 35:34.131
Well, look, guys,
it's getting late.

35:34.133 --> 35:35.332
I say we call it a day.

35:35.334 --> 35:36.633
Good job, I mean,

35:36.635 --> 35:37.901
the coin is amazing.

35:37.903 --> 35:39.436
It's-it's been a good day.

35:39.438 --> 35:41.438
- All right.
- Sounds good. -Okay.

35:53.252 --> 35:57.320
<i>As a new day
begins on Oak Island...</i>

35:57.322 --> 35:58.455
<i>Craig, you want to tee it up?</i>

35:58.457 --> 35:59.923
<i>Okay. Sure thing.</i>

35:59.925 --> 36:01.591
Get this up here.

36:01.593 --> 36:02.726
<i>Rick Lagina and Craig Tester</i>

36:02.728 --> 36:05.262
<i>begin focusing their attention</i>

36:05.264 --> 36:08.398
<i>on the second of
the team's two target sites:</i>

36:08.400 --> 36:11.568
<i>Borehole C-1.</i>

36:11.570 --> 36:14.337
These are video clips
that we ran last year,

36:14.339 --> 36:15.505
and this should
give you some sense of what

36:15.507 --> 36:17.340
you're about to
encounter as the drilling

36:17.342 --> 36:18.909
process proceeds.

36:18.911 --> 36:21.611
Maybe you can glean
some information from it.

36:21.613 --> 36:24.347
This one we saw, there
will be nice shiny objects.

36:24.349 --> 36:25.849
So we definitely want
to show that to you.

36:25.851 --> 36:27.551
Yes. I've heard
a lot about that.

36:27.553 --> 36:29.553
Here we go.

36:29.555 --> 36:32.889
<i>Last year,
Rick Lagina supervised</i>

36:32.891 --> 36:34.558
<i>the drilling
of an exploratory borehole</i>

36:34.560 --> 36:37.694
<i>in an area of the Money Pit
chosen by.</i>

36:37.696 --> 36:40.330
<i>Island historian,
Charles Barkhouse.</i>

36:40.332 --> 36:41.431
That right there.

36:41.433 --> 36:42.632
<i>After putting a camera</i>

36:42.634 --> 36:44.501
<i>down the hole,</i>

36:44.503 --> 36:47.437
<i>they spotted a mysterious
gold-colored object</i>

36:47.439 --> 36:48.738
<i>embedded in rock</i>

36:48.740 --> 36:50.907
<i>some 170-feet deep</i>

36:50.909 --> 36:52.842
<i>underground.</i>

36:52.844 --> 36:54.411
It looks metallic.

36:54.413 --> 36:55.912
Look how yellow that is.

36:55.914 --> 36:57.314
It's your gold color, David.

36:57.316 --> 36:59.683
Yeah, there it is, David.

37:01.687 --> 37:04.621
Yeah. Okay, here we go.

37:04.623 --> 37:05.989
You can see, this is

37:05.991 --> 37:08.625
the shiny object
we're talking about.

37:08.627 --> 37:11.461
Definitely.
It does not look like rock.

37:11.463 --> 37:12.796
No.

37:12.798 --> 37:14.497
I see the hook.

37:14.499 --> 37:17.334
- Yeah.
- I didn't see that before.

37:17.336 --> 37:18.768
- Yeah, yeah.
- Right there. Right there.

37:18.770 --> 37:20.704
- Yeah, yeah, okay.
- Right there.

37:20.706 --> 37:22.839
It's got a curvature to it,
like you said, like a hook.

37:22.841 --> 37:24.708
Goes up like this.

37:24.710 --> 37:26.543
Yeah.

37:26.545 --> 37:28.845
It does indeed look
like something.

37:28.847 --> 37:31.548
What it is,

37:31.550 --> 37:33.516
I wish I knew.

37:33.518 --> 37:36.453
So, this is what
we need you bring up.

37:36.455 --> 37:38.588
Do you feel comfortable
doing that or not?

37:38.590 --> 37:40.490
Putting the hammer grab down.

37:40.492 --> 37:44.461
<i>Now there is another
challenge facing Rick,</i>

37:44.463 --> 37:47.464
<i>Craig and the Oak Island team.</i>

37:47.466 --> 37:52.335
<i>Not only must they locate the
mysterious shiny object again,</i>

37:52.337 --> 37:55.472
<i>but assuming they can,
they must figure out a way</i>

37:55.474 --> 37:57.307
<i>to retrieve it.</i>

37:57.309 --> 37:59.743
I got to go look at the, the
geometry of the hammer grab,

37:59.745 --> 38:02.512
and when the jaws open and close
and see what we could

38:02.514 --> 38:04.281
weld a shroud to that.

38:04.283 --> 38:06.883
Very similar to our drill bit,
you know, we can

38:06.885 --> 38:09.352
go down into the socket
without fear of collapse.

38:09.354 --> 38:11.488
There's nothing fancy
about it, but...

38:11.490 --> 38:12.956
if it's effective, I mean
that's all you're looking for.

38:12.958 --> 38:14.624
That's for sure.

38:14.626 --> 38:17.060
I'm glad you didn't see anything
that puts you off.

38:17.062 --> 38:19.629
Yeah. No, I think we're still
in pretty good shape.

38:19.631 --> 38:21.631
So, yeah. Let's go
get David's shiny thing.

38:21.633 --> 38:23.433
Let's go get David's shiny thing.
Okay.

38:23.435 --> 38:25.435
- Sounds good.
- All right, thanks, guys.

38:25.437 --> 38:27.370
Thank you.

38:41.353 --> 38:42.752
Hi, guys.

38:42.754 --> 38:43.887
Charles, what's going on?

38:43.889 --> 38:45.488
Looks like they're just

38:45.490 --> 38:47.557
ready to drop
the first can into C-1.

38:47.559 --> 38:50.560
Yeah, baby! You got to be
excited about that.

38:50.562 --> 38:52.829
Well, I'll be more excited
if we actually find something.

38:52.831 --> 38:55.465
This is called C-1 for a reason.
I know.

38:55.467 --> 38:57.500
- You picked this hole.
- I did.

38:57.502 --> 39:00.403
<i>I respect Charles' knowledge</i>

39:00.405 --> 39:03.473
<i>of the Money Pit,
of the Oak Island story.</i>

39:03.475 --> 39:06.076
He was tasked with, "Put
an X on the ground, Charles."

39:06.078 --> 39:08.778
Based on your information,
your knowledge base,

39:08.780 --> 39:10.547
<i>your instinct,</i>

39:10.549 --> 39:13.016
<i>your gut feeling
about Oak Island.</i>

39:13.018 --> 39:15.752
<i>Put an X
on the Money Pit ground.</i>

39:15.754 --> 39:17.053
<i>And we'll drill it.</i>

39:17.055 --> 39:19.622
<i>He did.</i>

39:19.624 --> 39:21.891
Gentlemen. You ready to slam can?
Hey, guys.

39:21.893 --> 39:23.126
We're ready to slam some can...

39:23.128 --> 39:25.829
- Kent?
- My brother.

39:25.831 --> 39:28.131
We're gonna have a little
better luck this time? -Yes.

39:28.133 --> 39:31.368
We're set up on C-1.
The oscillator's ready to go.

39:31.370 --> 39:32.736
We got the pipe hooked up

39:32.738 --> 39:33.903
and we're ready
to load it right now.

39:33.905 --> 39:36.072
- Slam can.
- Let's do it.

39:36.074 --> 39:37.640
All right, here we go, boys.

39:37.642 --> 39:39.109
Workin' down. Workin' down.

39:39.111 --> 39:40.710
Lookin' good. Lookin' good.

39:40.712 --> 39:43.947
All right about two feet
to thread. Here we go.

39:43.949 --> 39:46.983
Coming down. We threaded over there, Beb?
Yep.

39:46.985 --> 39:48.385
All right,
here we go. We workin'.

39:49.521 --> 39:51.454
There she is.

39:51.456 --> 39:53.556
All right here we go,
workin' down.

39:53.558 --> 39:55.625
<i>Once again, the giant,</i>

39:55.627 --> 39:57.794
<i>15-ton drilling oscillator</i>

39:57.796 --> 40:00.130
<i>grinds the massive steel caisson</i>

40:00.132 --> 40:02.932
<i>into the rocky ground.</i>

40:02.934 --> 40:04.801
<i>If all goes well,</i>

40:04.803 --> 40:06.836
<i>it should reach its target depth</i>

40:06.838 --> 40:11.441
<i>of 170 feet within a few days.</i>

40:11.443 --> 40:13.743
He's already starting
to oscillate, man.

40:13.745 --> 40:15.044
- There you go.
- Yeah, right now,

40:15.046 --> 40:16.713
we're gonna put it in.
Do a little

40:16.715 --> 40:18.081
at a time, leveling it
and making sure

40:18.083 --> 40:20.016
it's exactly where you want it.

40:20.018 --> 40:21.985
Well, Andrew, just don't miss
the shiny, gold thing,

40:21.987 --> 40:23.787
- okay?
- That's all we have to hit now?

40:23.789 --> 40:25.021
- That's it.
- Okay.

40:25.023 --> 40:26.589
- Consider it done.
- All right.

40:26.591 --> 40:29.659
I love that attitude, man.

40:31.129 --> 40:32.629
<i>Our hopes for C-1 are that</i>

40:32.631 --> 40:34.697
<i>it's an explorable cavity,</i>

40:34.699 --> 40:37.200
and that there is a physical
connection between

40:37.202 --> 40:39.803
<i>some type of man-made work</i>

40:39.805 --> 40:43.940
<i>in the traditional Money Pit,
which connects to this void.</i>

40:43.942 --> 40:46.576
<i>Some 170 feet</i>

40:46.578 --> 40:49.579
<i>below the surface of Oak Island</i>

40:49.581 --> 40:51.815
<i>lies a mysterious, golden object</i>

40:51.817 --> 40:54.584
<i>embedded in stone.</i>

40:54.586 --> 40:57.687
<i>Is it simply another piece</i>

40:57.689 --> 40:59.155
<i>in an enormous puzzle</i>

40:59.157 --> 41:01.124
<i>that has confounded
treasure hunters</i>

41:01.126 --> 41:04.828
<i>for more than 200 years?</i>

41:04.830 --> 41:06.963
<i>Or is it a glimpse</i>

41:06.965 --> 41:09.532
<i>of the treasure itself?</i>

41:09.534 --> 41:11.768
<i>One thing is certain.</i>

41:11.770 --> 41:14.504
<i>The Laginas and their partners</i>

41:14.506 --> 41:16.172
<i>have dedicated
millions of dollars</i>

41:16.174 --> 41:19.476
<i>to solving
the Oak Island mystery.</i>

41:19.478 --> 41:23.046
<i>Giving up is no
longer an option.</i>

41:26.785 --> 41:29.786
<i>Next time,</i>
<i>on</i> The Curse of Oak Island...

41:29.788 --> 41:31.254
- Here we go.
- As soon as that

41:31.256 --> 41:34.257
drops in, you're 15 feet
away from the void.

41:34.259 --> 41:36.493
There's a shiny
gold thing down there.

41:36.495 --> 41:37.627
- David!
- What?

41:37.629 --> 41:39.562
Drain the swamp!

41:39.564 --> 41:41.898
- Here we go!
- We can finally start

41:41.900 --> 41:43.733
excavating in the swamp.

41:43.735 --> 41:45.268
Look at that!

41:45.270 --> 41:47.070
This is a piece
of the Spanish galleon.

41:47.072 --> 41:49.138
Six people have lost their lives

41:49.140 --> 41:52.008
trying to do what you may be
able to do this afternoon.

41:52.010 --> 41:53.543
It's definitely
inside the cavity.

41:53.545 --> 41:55.545
There you go, the door's open.
