00:00.540 --> 00:02.029
You've met Mr.Daniels.

00:02.670 --> 00:03.820
- You're a...
- Teacher.

00:04.180 --> 00:07.580
Tasha was just protecting
me,because she knew that

00:07.580 --> 00:09.680
he had hit me before
when I lived with him.

00:09.680 --> 00:11.660
She was afraid he was
gonna hit me again.

00:11.680 --> 00:13.450
Nothing you say on that
stand's gonna change

00:13.450 --> 00:17.030
how anyone in that room feels
about you. Or how I feel.

00:17.300 --> 00:18.870
Go back in there and
tell them the truth.

00:18.870 --> 00:22.110
I was afraid he was going to
force me to have sex with him.

00:22.110 --> 00:23.800
That's a lie! She's lying!

00:23.800 --> 00:25.410
So,what's-what's going on there?

00:25.510 --> 00:27.860
The D.A.'s pressing
charges against Trey.

00:27.860 --> 00:30.390
Nothing's changed,right? With us?

00:30.850 --> 00:32.770
No,no. Nothing's changed.

00:32.770 --> 00:34.350
Nate,think fast.

00:35.330 --> 00:36.010
Dad.

00:36.330 --> 00:39.140
I'm not the one who cheated
on my wife with my employee,

00:39.140 --> 00:42.140
and made promises he had
no intention of keeping.

00:42.430 --> 00:44.010
What happened in the past...

00:46.000 --> 00:47.170
is the past.

01:07.270 --> 01:08.840
Rise and shine.

01:11.470 --> 01:12.910
Unless I've been asleep for a week,

01:12.910 --> 01:15.080
aren't we supposed to
be on break from work?

01:15.340 --> 01:16.640
Well,we might have the week off,

01:16.640 --> 01:18.290
but today is Lux's
first day back at school,

01:18.290 --> 01:20.130
so I thought we could
have a family breakfast.

01:20.460 --> 01:22.260
You know,as a family.

01:22.650 --> 01:23.720
Five more minutes.

01:24.140 --> 01:25.790
I'm making French toast.

01:26.690 --> 01:29.680
That's perfect. The fire
alarm will wake me up.

01:31.540 --> 01:35.610
Stop. Stop. Stop it!

01:35.970 --> 01:37.640
- You ever gonna let me get out of bed?
- No.

01:37.870 --> 01:44.540
No,I love having you in my bed.
And on my couch. And in my shower.

01:45.110 --> 01:47.050
Ah! Actually,about the shower...

01:47.350 --> 01:49.020
Sorry about that. But you know what?

01:49.020 --> 01:50.820
That calf cramp came out of nowhere.

01:50.830 --> 01:55.670
No,no,no. Not that.
It's,uh,your bathroom.

01:55.670 --> 01:59.030
It-It smells like someone's
been stir-frying socks in there.

01:59.030 --> 02:02.120
And can you ask Math not to leave
his tube of foot cream on the sink?

02:02.120 --> 02:05.820
- Cause that was a close call.
- Yeah.

02:05.820 --> 02:08.910
I know that my living
situation is not exactly ideal.

02:11.200 --> 02:15.750
In fact,I,um... I've been
thinking about it a lot lately.

02:15.750 --> 02:17.700
I want to show you
something. Hold on. Okay.

02:32.530 --> 02:34.910
- It's a house.
- I see that.

02:34.910 --> 02:36.690
Yeah,it's a little
out of my price range,

02:36.970 --> 02:39.320
but after I paid for
everything with Lux,

02:39.320 --> 02:42.300
I still have over half of that
bonus I got from signing Candy.

02:42.700 --> 02:46.120
Thank you. And I worked
out a deal with my dad.

02:46.450 --> 02:50.410
If I fix up the bar,we can sell
the building and split the profits.

02:50.740 --> 02:55.770
Which will easily put me in
the clear for a down payment.

02:57.070 --> 03:00.220
- wow!This is huge.
- Yeah,and it's long overdue.

03:01.290 --> 03:06.900
Look,I've... God,I have had a
great time living in this loft,

03:08.210 --> 03:10.160
but I think it's time I grow up.

03:10.630 --> 03:13.580
You know,get away from the
revolving door of roommates,

03:13.690 --> 03:17.060
the noise,the mess,Math's foot cream.

03:19.460 --> 03:24.390
This house is the first step in
me thinking about my future,and...

03:26.710 --> 03:28.650
I just want you to know I see you in i

03:29.770 --> 03:34.360
- In the house?
- No,in my future.

03:35.850 --> 03:37.170
I mean,obviously in the house,too,

03:37.170 --> 03:40.400
because that's-that's where
I'll be living in the future.

03:41.560 --> 03:48.000
And I'm not asking you to move in
with me right away,but eventually.

03:49.330 --> 03:53.190
Because I'm in this with
you,Emma. For the long haul.

04:18.029 --> 04:21.390
- Lux! Breakfast!
- I'm not hungry!

04:21.390 --> 04:23.940
Oh,come on! Yes,you are!

04:24.340 --> 04:26.520
I'm wearing an apron
and everything! Come on!

04:27.340 --> 04:31.310
The eggs and toast are getting
cold. Nobody likes a cold breakfast.

04:32.110 --> 04:35.790
Lux? Would you come down here already?

04:35.790 --> 04:38.320
- Lux!
- I'm coming!

04:38.680 --> 04:41.720
Oh,good. I hope you
didn't feel any pressure.

04:41.990 --> 04:43.660
All right,so... What do
you want for breakfast?

04:43.660 --> 04:46.990
We've got eggs. We've got fruit.
French toast. Oh,and there's,uh...

04:46.990 --> 04:48.090
There's fake bacon...

04:48.090 --> 04:53.250
Maybe just some toast. Not the
French kind. The regular,edible kind.

04:54.270 --> 04:56.380
- It's pregnancy hormones.
- What?

04:56.800 --> 04:58.930
Oh,just gonna have
some of this fake bacon.

04:59.120 --> 05:02.360
Okay,so,Lux,after school today,I
want you to go over to Baze's office.

05:02.360 --> 05:04.650
And you can hang out there and do your
homework until he's done with work,

05:04.650 --> 05:06.270
and then he will bring you back here.

05:06.270 --> 05:07.890
I don't need a babysitter.

05:08.280 --> 05:10.940
Lux,Trey is out on bail.

05:11.270 --> 05:12.080
So?

05:12.370 --> 05:15.380
So,we pressed charges against him.
He is roaming free until the trial.

05:15.380 --> 05:17.150
I don't want him coming after you.

05:18.910 --> 05:21.670
From now on,I want to know
where you are at all times.

05:21.670 --> 05:23.390
Hey. You know what might be easier?

05:23.780 --> 05:26.110
If you install a LoJack
system in my butt.

05:30.300 --> 05:34.490
- Is it cool if I walk to the car by myself?
- That's very funny.

05:36.460 --> 05:45.370
All right,well,I'm in the
hall! Walking out the door! Bye!

05:47.170 --> 05:52.350
Hey,Cate,listen,um... You need to relax.

05:53.570 --> 05:57.030
You know what's not relaxing? Having
you constantly tell me to relax.

05:58.630 --> 06:01.970
Look,I can't relax. That man,he
hurt her in more ways than one.

06:02.510 --> 06:07.000
I know. It's horrible
to even think about it.

06:09.110 --> 06:10.960
But look,you know,that
was a long time ago.

06:10.960 --> 06:14.090
There's-There's nothing you
can really do about it now.

06:14.470 --> 06:16.510
I can just make sure that
it doesn't happen again.

06:17.000 --> 06:19.590
It won't,okay? It won't.

06:20.160 --> 06:25.250
But y-you've got to stop smothering
her. I mean,Lux isn't dwelling on it.

06:25.630 --> 06:29.460
And I don't think reminding her
every two seconds is... useful.

06:32.090 --> 06:34.530
Look,she's really trying to
move on. I think you should,too.

06:42.400 --> 06:44.890
Hey,your French toast is great.

06:46.570 --> 06:49.250
This bacon,not so much.

06:54.300 --> 06:57.820
Listen,Jack,I gave the syndicate
manager my IPO allocations.

06:58.920 --> 07:01.870
Yeah,you know... Can... Let's
just talk about this when I get in.

07:02.850 --> 07:05.030
Mm-hmm. Yeah,I'll be there in 20.

07:05.830 --> 07:08.260
Baze,honestly,I-I could
have just walked to school.

07:08.260 --> 07:13.120
No way. Cate would kill me.
Besides,I want you to see this.

07:16.320 --> 07:17.990
What,are you buying a house?

07:19.760 --> 07:22.820
- What? When did this happen?
- Well,it hasn't. I mean,not yet.

07:23.230 --> 07:25.990
- It's big. Bigger than Cate's.
- I know.

07:26.680 --> 07:29.070
Look,it's time you have your own room.

07:29.070 --> 07:31.880
I mean,one with actual walls
and not shower curtains.

07:32.320 --> 07:36.230
Plus,Emma's going to move in at some
point,and I want there to be space for her,too.

07:37.080 --> 07:40.180
So,come on,ladies. I want you to
see the inside. Just a little...

07:40.290 --> 07:43.110
- little walkthrough.
- Uh...actually,Baze?

07:43.930 --> 07:51.000
Can I just talk to Emma about
something real quick? Girl stuff.

07:53.650 --> 07:55.210
See you inside.

07:59.220 --> 08:02.740
You're not going to say
anything? About you and his dad?

08:02.740 --> 08:06.090
You can't just let him dump his
life savings into this house for you,

08:06.090 --> 08:07.910
if you might not even
be there to live in it.

08:07.910 --> 08:11.600
Believe it or not,there's
no good time to tell the guy

08:11.600 --> 08:13.960
you're dating that you used
to sleep with his father.

08:14.430 --> 08:16.550
Well,the truth always
comes out eventually.

08:16.550 --> 08:18.560
So you are going to have to
figure out a way to tell him,

08:18.560 --> 08:21.820
or find a way to keep him from
buying this house for the two of you.

08:43.120 --> 08:47.160
- You're a hard guy to get ahold of.
- Lux,hey.

08:47.690 --> 08:50.480
I sent you,like,50 texts.
Did you not get any of them?

08:50.970 --> 08:55.260
My parents' place has really bad
reception. And,uh,holidays with my family...

08:55.260 --> 08:57.430
You know,I barely had
any time to myself.

08:58.810 --> 09:02.660
Two bad excuses instead of one? You
really know how to show a girl you care.

09:03.780 --> 09:06.370
I guess I just needed some
time to think about things.

09:08.790 --> 09:10.620
And what do you think?

09:11.730 --> 09:15.250
I don't know. This whole thing
has been kind of a lot,I guess.

09:15.840 --> 09:17.490
Okay. Eric,I-I know.

09:17.760 --> 09:20.160
I know it's screwed up,but
I've been thinking,too.

09:20.160 --> 09:23.330
And if you didn't work
here,this would not be an issue.

09:23.330 --> 09:24.610
Or if I didn't go here.

09:24.860 --> 09:28.250
- Lux,but I do. And you do.
- Not for long.

09:29.080 --> 09:33.300
Look,Baze
- he is buying a house in another district.

09:33.300 --> 09:35.820
I could... I could change schools,and
you wouldn't be my teacher.

09:35.820 --> 09:38.230
We could almost be a normal couple.

09:39.850 --> 09:41.790
I said,"almost.

09:43.570 --> 09:45.010
" You should probably get to class.

09:45.650 --> 09:48.410
Okay,well,just... Come
over Tasha's place.

09:48.410 --> 09:50.470
It's empty until she
gets back from juvie.

09:51.030 --> 09:54.480
We could hang out. You could
get your Christmas present.

09:55.300 --> 10:00.790
You could spend the night. We
could spend the night together.

10:01.520 --> 10:04.820
- We shouldn't do that.
- Okay. I'm not just talking about that.

10:06.060 --> 10:08.730
The last time you spent the
night,you slept on the floor.

10:08.730 --> 10:11.150
I just... I want to be together.

10:11.700 --> 10:13.150
I need to.

10:16.630 --> 10:19.390
What about,um,Cate and Baze?

10:19.630 --> 10:24.130
- They're not just going to let you stay out all night.
- Then I will figure something out. Okay?

10:24.190 --> 10:28.180
You show up to Tasha's,and I
will take care of everything else.

10:32.190 --> 10:33.320
Okay.

10:34.200 --> 10:36.120
So,is it a date?

10:36.620 --> 10:38.180
Yeah. It's a date.

Season 01 Episode 12</font>

11:22.600 --> 11:23.850
I got great news.

11:23.850 --> 11:25.610
You talked to Math about the foot cream?

11:25.610 --> 11:28.010
I might be able to get the
house sooner than I thought.

11:28.350 --> 11:30.460
What? Wow.

11:30.460 --> 11:33.470
Well,I talked to the owner.
Apparently,the house is underwater.

11:33.470 --> 11:37.220
And after a few awkward minutes of thinking
that he was talking about a plumbing problem...

11:37.220 --> 11:39.640
he said he'd be willing
to sell it to me for less.

11:39.640 --> 11:43.510
So I think I'm gonna make him an offer.
You know,before anyone beats me to it.

11:44.490 --> 11:46.740
But I thought you needed the
money from selling the bar.

11:46.740 --> 11:50.730
I'll need it for the mortgage,but with the
lower price,I have enough for the down payment.

11:51.890 --> 11:55.200
- What? - No. I-I...think
it's fantastic. I do...

11:56.750 --> 12:00.050
Well,why do I get the feeling that there's
a big,hairy "but" hanging out there?

12:00.130 --> 12:03.760
No,no. No hairy "buts. " Look,I-I
just... I want to make sure that you're...

12:05.180 --> 12:09.330
you're doing this for you,you
know,because it's what you really want.

12:09.330 --> 12:10.580
You know,not for us.

12:10.580 --> 12:14.150
Of course it's what
I want. For me and us.

12:16.570 --> 12:20.380
Right. Right. But,I mean,you...
you'd be buying the house anyway?

12:20.750 --> 12:22.460
Right? Even if there was no "us"?

12:22.460 --> 12:27.160
Okay,what do you mean,"no us"? Weren't
we just talking about the long haul?

12:27.670 --> 12:35.990
We are,but... There's just
no easy way to say this.

12:36.390 --> 12:39.940
What? Just say it. Spit it out.

12:40.600 --> 12:42.700
Emma,what?

12:44.150 --> 12:48.260
- S- Sam. It's Sam.
- What about him?

12:48.410 --> 12:50.680
It's just been so hard,you
know,since he got here,

12:50.680 --> 12:54.600
and I wonder if it's just because
things are moving too fast for him.

12:55.080 --> 12:57.010
I mean,you two barely
even know each other.

12:57.250 --> 13:03.820
So,we'll get to know each other. I'm
on it. Little dudes? They love me.

13:04.380 --> 13:07.670
- Right.
- See? Problem solved.

13:30.510 --> 13:33.410
- What are you doing here?
- Uh,waiting for Baze.

13:33.410 --> 13:36.750
Apparently,you're not the only one
that requires adult supervision now.

13:37.400 --> 13:41.230
I heard Tasha got sent away.
That ought to lower your profile.

13:41.800 --> 13:43.430
Can you leave me alone?

13:43.990 --> 13:46.950
Why don't you get your boyfriend to baby-sit
you? He seems like an upstanding guy.

13:47.610 --> 13:50.830
- Breaking the law aside.
- He's not breaking the law.

13:52.380 --> 13:54.520
Oh,so you guys haven't
sealed the deal yet?

13:55.790 --> 13:58.170
You know,in some social circles
that's called statutory rape.

13:58.170 --> 14:00.830
Okay,you can stop talking anytime.

14:01.650 --> 14:02.680
Are you going to see him tonight?

14:02.680 --> 14:04.340
Is that why you looked
so happy at school today?

14:04.340 --> 14:05.300
What?

14:05.760 --> 14:07.410
You should tell him next time
he's gonna hook up with a student,

14:07.410 --> 14:10.430
he should have his heart to hearts in
a classroom that's not made of glass.

14:10.880 --> 14:12.690
Okay. Go to hell.

14:13.370 --> 14:15.180
I've missed our little talks.

14:16.830 --> 14:19.540
Hey,kiddo. You ready?

14:20.170 --> 14:21.270
You have no idea.

14:21.700 --> 14:26.360
- Hey,Sam,your mom has
got to work late tonight.

14:26.360 --> 14:28.790
The good news is it gives us a little
chance to spend some time together.

14:29.310 --> 14:31.580
- What do you say?
- Pass.

14:31.580 --> 14:33.230
You only doin' one-word answers?

14:33.230 --> 14:35.610
Trust me,the more words
he says,the worse it is.

14:36.220 --> 14:39.470
Come on,your mom's cool with
it. It'll be fun. We can,uh...

14:39.760 --> 14:42.990
I don't know. We can fire up the Wii. We
can order some pizza,crack open some beer...

14:44.200 --> 14:47.130
Root beer for you. Don't
get that look on your face.

14:47.780 --> 14:52.000
Only if Lux comes. I mean,you don't have
any plans with anyone tonight,do you?

14:52.440 --> 14:57.020
Actually,I-I do. With Cate.
Celebrity Rehab marathon.

14:57.020 --> 15:00.280
Since she can't drink,she just wants to
watch a bunch of people who can't,either.

15:01.430 --> 15:04.810
All right. Well,then,it sounds
like it's just the two of us.

15:04.810 --> 15:08.880
Men. Bonding. Like men. Bonding.

15:09.470 --> 15:12.890
I'm,um... I'm gonna grab my
bag,and then we will split.

15:12.970 --> 15:14.380
Yes.

15:16.980 --> 15:20.770
Celebrity Rehab marathon? That's
the best lie you could come up with?

15:22.280 --> 15:25.150
You realize what you're doing with
Mr. Daniels is really messed-up,right?

15:25.150 --> 15:27.790
Okay,what I am doing is
none of your business.

15:27.980 --> 15:32.300
You want to talk about people doing messed-up
things,maybe you should talk to your mom.

15:32.490 --> 15:34.660
- What about her?
- The top of the list?

15:35.230 --> 15:37.410
She's about to move in with Baze.

15:40.520 --> 15:42.390
- Ready,kiddo?
- Yeah.

15:43.300 --> 15:45.830
Sam,coming?

15:51.870 --> 15:54.540
Do you really think we need all
these? You're only two months pregnant.

15:54.750 --> 15:58.660
- Isn't this all a little premature?
- Yeah,well,what if our baby is?

15:58.660 --> 15:59.790
I mean,will you listen to this?

15:59.790 --> 16:02.210
"Changing your baby can be
a challenge for new parents,

16:02.210 --> 16:04.780
"but maintaining contact is
integral to the baby's safety.

16:04.980 --> 16:06.850
"Countless mothers have turned
their backs "for a split second,

16:06.850 --> 16:10.680
had their babies roll onto the floor and
die on impact. " I mean,die on impact?

16:10.680 --> 16:13.140
- You're overwhelming our fetus.
- You know what,it's the truth.

16:13.140 --> 16:16.230
Anything can happen at anytime.
All we can do is be prepared.

16:16.250 --> 16:21.330
You know,maybe you should go the hardware store across the street and pick up those,like,child
- proofing clips.

16:21.330 --> 16:23.640
Okay,yeah. I think
there's a bar next door.

16:32.590 --> 16:36.820
- Eric. Hey.
- Hey. Hi. Uh,Happy New Year.

16:36.970 --> 16:38.970
You,too.

16:39.800 --> 16:44.430
- Ah. Eeyore,You're the Greatest.
- Uh,it's for my niece. Hmm...

16:45.710 --> 16:49.340
Oh,congratulations on the baby.
I didn't get a chance to tell you.

16:49.340 --> 16:51.970
Yes. Well,thank you. Just
catching up on a little reading.

16:54.030 --> 16:56.970
Look,I just,I really want to
thank you for being at Lux's trial.

16:57.440 --> 16:59.640
You know,it really meant
a lot to her,to all of us.

16:59.640 --> 17:03.720
Sure. Is everything okay?

17:05.609 --> 17:08.560
Yeah,it's funny. You know,there's
a million books on babies,

17:08.560 --> 17:11.200
but I guess books that
deal with horrible mothers

17:11.200 --> 17:14.099
that give up their kids to horrible
situations are not bestsellers.

17:14.099 --> 17:17.400
Cate,you can't beat
yourself up over that.

17:18.380 --> 17:20.339
Okay,you've done everything
that you could for Lux now.

17:20.900 --> 17:22.390
You have to believe that.

17:22.829 --> 17:24.339
You're the one that's been great to her.

17:24.730 --> 17:28.980
You know,you helped diagnose her learning
disability,you got her to be honest on the stand.

17:29.950 --> 17:32.520
We would have never known
the truth without you.

17:35.400 --> 17:37.670
Eric,after everything...

17:38.910 --> 17:44.540
after Trey,I just really want to thank you for
being an adult in Lux's life that she can trust.

17:45.440 --> 17:47.770
Someone I can trust.

17:50.840 --> 17:54.850
Um,it's good to see you. I
- I got to run.

18:34.970 --> 18:36.590
Hey,what's up with this thing?

18:37.010 --> 18:41.230
Oh. No,you just have to
push down on-on the latch.

18:41.230 --> 18:43.200
Oh,you child-proofed it already?

18:43.200 --> 18:45.090
Yeah,well,you're not letting
me take care of one kid,

18:45.090 --> 18:46.680
so I'm gonna take care of the other.

18:46.680 --> 18:48.930
Going to Baze's. He wants
me to help clean the bar.

18:49.150 --> 18:52.900
Okay,that's fine. That is
fine. I am just gonna drive you.

18:52.900 --> 18:56.430
What
- Okay,Cate! What,are you gonna drive me around for the rest of my life?

18:56.430 --> 19:00.220
No,not for the rest of your life. I
- look,I just want to protect you.

19:00.220 --> 19:02.380
Okay,well,just back off.

19:02.780 --> 19:05.880
I don't need protecting,and
I don't want it. I'm fine.

19:05.880 --> 19:08.210
Okay,well,you know,you don't seem fine.

19:09.220 --> 19:12.020
Listen,you can call it maternal instinct
or whatever it is that you want to call it,

19:12.020 --> 19:17.450
- but Lux,you just,you don't seem okay.
- What I'm not okay with is you micromanaging me,

19:17.550 --> 19:20.840
you being on top of me and you reminding
me every three seconds what happened.

19:20.840 --> 19:24.460
I just want to forget about it. I
want everyone to forget about it.

19:24.460 --> 19:27.120
Cate,she can walk to Baze's.
I mean,it's broad daylight.

19:27.120 --> 19:28.060
Ryan,no.

19:28.060 --> 19:30.320
You can't be on top of her all
the time; we talked about this.

19:30.320 --> 19:32.310
Yes,we did talk about this. And
what if something happens to her?

19:32.310 --> 19:35.610
Nothing is gonna happen to me. The past
- I've dealt with it.

19:36.730 --> 19:39.010
Now,if you can't,then
that's your problem.

19:41.160 --> 19:44.530
Whoa,Cate,Cate,come on.
Just let her go,all right?

19:54.480 --> 19:56.840
Wow. Still a dump.

19:58.060 --> 20:02.780
It actually looked a lot like this the
first time I ever saw the place,back in 2007.

20:03.460 --> 20:05.470
I renovated it,installed the bar.

20:06.890 --> 20:11.310
I picked out every detail,you
know,right down to the shot glasses.

20:11.500 --> 20:14.460
You know,you should record that and
put it on one of those museum headsets.

20:15.140 --> 20:17.060
- It's fascinating.
- That's funny.

20:17.650 --> 20:20.200
Hey,um,can you help me move this?

20:20.200 --> 20:24.690
I got to,I got to get a bunch of stuff out the
back so that the junk removal guy can take it.

20:30.180 --> 20:33.530
You realize you found me outside my mom's
office,not outside of a hardware store.

20:33.530 --> 20:35.380
You're not here because
I want free manual labor.

20:35.380 --> 20:37.780
You're here so we can
spend some time together.

20:39.690 --> 20:41.300
You think I don't
know what you're doing?

20:41.800 --> 20:42.870
Lux told me about the house.

20:42.870 --> 20:44.970
You don't have to suck up
to me to move in with my mom.

20:44.970 --> 20:46.180
Clearly,I'm not stopping her.

20:46.180 --> 20:47.670
Well,actually,you are.

20:48.240 --> 20:50.540
She doesn't want to do anything
that you're not okay with.

20:51.410 --> 20:54.010
My mom doesn't give a crap
about what I'm okay with.

20:56.450 --> 21:00.460
My mom doesn't even want
me. She doesn't even like me.

21:01.100 --> 21:04.260
That's why she sent me off to my dad's
for the holidays,and you know what?

21:04.920 --> 21:06.310
He doesn't want me,either.

21:06.440 --> 21:09.940
He moved in with his stupid-ass
girlfriend and gave her snotty kid my room,

21:09.940 --> 21:12.690
and now my mom's moving in
with you. Where am I to go?

21:13.020 --> 21:14.370
Back to boarding school?

21:14.370 --> 21:17.090
Maybe she'll find an excuse
to put me back into rehab.

21:17.510 --> 21:19.660
So if you want help
cleaning up this stupid bar

21:19.660 --> 21:21.590
so you can all move into
a stupid house without me,

21:21.870 --> 21:24.370
you can get your own
damn kid to help you out.

21:29.020 --> 21:33.490
Hey,Sam. Sam.

21:41.330 --> 21:43.190
Really? A text?

21:43.330 --> 21:46.010
You're gonna blow me off,and-and
you can't even say it to my face?

21:46.010 --> 21:48.340
I can't keep doing this,okay? I
- I can't.

21:48.510 --> 21:52.040
Since when? Since when can
you not do this anymore?

21:55.420 --> 21:58.000
Since you heard about what Trey did.

21:59.320 --> 22:02.030
- Hey,hey...
- No,no. Let go of me!

22:02.030 --> 22:02.660
- Hey,just...
- No.

22:02.660 --> 22:05.240
You said telling the truth
wouldn't change anything.

22:05.970 --> 22:08.400
You said that if I got up on
that stand and I told the truth,

22:08.630 --> 22:11.570
that everyone who loved
me would keep loving me.

22:12.210 --> 22:15.240
That it wouldn't change how anyone felt.
That it wouldn't change how you felt.

22:15.240 --> 22:18.190
Lux,I know. I know what I said,but
it did. It changed things...

22:18.190 --> 22:20.110
This is why I didn't
want to say anything.

22:21.050 --> 22:25.820
I knew you'd look at me like I was
disgusting,or like I wanted him to...

22:25.820 --> 22:28.550
What? No,no,no,no,no,that's
not it at all,okay?

22:28.910 --> 22:32.500
Do you understand? Listen,it's
not how I'm looking at you.

22:32.500 --> 22:35.100
It's how I'm looking at me.
I am not any better than Trey.

22:35.100 --> 22:38.060
- I'm doing the same thing that he did.
- No,you are nothing like him! You...

22:38.440 --> 22:41.150
No,no,no. You are...
You are a good person.

22:41.720 --> 22:47.050
Look,you have helped me in
ways that no one else ever has.

22:47.750 --> 22:51.110
You understand me in ways that
I didn't think anyone ever could.

22:51.110 --> 22:53.810
What we're doing is wrong.
It's always been wrong.

22:53.810 --> 22:55.390
- No.
- Yes.

22:56.110 --> 23:00.280
- Okay,at the trial,after hearing what Trey did...
- Don't let him keep doing it!

23:01.260 --> 23:03.410
He's ruined everything for me.

23:04.470 --> 23:07.600
He ruined it back then,and
he is ruining it again.

23:07.880 --> 23:10.110
It was bad enough that I lost
Valerie because of him,and now what?

23:10.110 --> 23:11.780
What,I'm losing you,too?

23:16.650 --> 23:20.700
No,no,you want to go,then just go. You want
to bail on me? You want to bail on tonight?

23:20.700 --> 23:23.040
- Listen,I am not... I'm not bailing!
- You want to bail on us?

23:23.810 --> 23:28.810
Okay? I'll be at Tasha's tonight,okay?

23:29.440 --> 23:31.240
I'll... I'll be there.

23:47.030 --> 23:50.640
Isn't this like kidnapping
or something? Come here.

23:50.930 --> 23:54.400
I said I would bring you home. We're
just... we're making a little pit stop.

23:55.300 --> 23:59.640
So... What do you think?

24:00.550 --> 24:02.960
You can add breaking and
entering to the arrest warrant?

24:03.350 --> 24:06.450
All right,look at,this right here
- this is the living room.

24:06.450 --> 24:08.800
We just got to find a cool
place for Lux's bong lamp.

24:09.280 --> 24:10.560
Follow me.

24:10.870 --> 24:15.590
Down this hall,we have the master
bedroom for,you know,me and your mom.

24:16.010 --> 24:19.100
It's got one of those bathrooms
with the double showerhead situation.

24:19.410 --> 24:21.240
Oh,sorry about that visual.

24:21.240 --> 24:24.400
Anyway,we got Lux's
bedroom upstairs,and you...

24:25.170 --> 24:28.950
Well,you know,you've got some options.
I was thinking the basement. Now,hold on.

24:28.950 --> 24:33.230
Because I think Lux- she's more of an
upper-level resider,coming from the attic and all.

24:33.480 --> 24:36.750
And that way,you can blare your
music,you can stink up the place,

24:36.750 --> 24:39.230
you can surf the Web with
a little bit of privacy.

24:39.840 --> 24:42.450
Although,you got to clear your
browser history,man,'cause that's...

24:43.740 --> 24:45.220
That's the downfall.

24:45.860 --> 24:50.160
Look,I know it may be hard to believe,but
nobody is kicking you to the curb.

24:51.340 --> 24:52.760
At least I'm not.

24:54.660 --> 24:56.510
There's room for you
here,if you want it.

25:07.520 --> 25:09.730
Cate. What are you doing here?

25:10.120 --> 25:14.450
Um,Lux
- she wasn't answering her phone,so I went over to the loft,and...

25:15.140 --> 25:20.140
Math said that you were here.
Um... is she not with you?

25:20.430 --> 25:23.400
No,she's supposed to be with you
watching some Celebrity Rehab thing.

25:23.490 --> 25:26.270
Uh,that's what she said,right?

25:27.260 --> 25:28.970
Um,I-I think so.

25:29.180 --> 25:32.030
Do you really? 'Cause it seems like
you were lying,like that was a lie.

25:32.030 --> 25:33.950
- Okay,Cate?
- What?

25:34.200 --> 25:36.870
It's not like he hasn't covered for
her before. Does my car ring a bell?

25:36.870 --> 25:39.440
Cate,he's not covering.
Sam is a good kid.

25:39.440 --> 25:41.220
So nice to know that
you two are so close.

25:41.220 --> 25:42.870
You have no idea where
our daughter is,but...

25:42.870 --> 25:45.810
Yeah,because she was
supposed to be with you,Cate!

25:45.810 --> 25:50.490
You cannot come over here and accuse me
of screwing up,accuse Sam of hiding things,

25:50.590 --> 25:52.600
when you're the one who
let her walk out the door.

25:53.340 --> 25:55.440
If Sam knew anything,he
would have told us,okay?

25:56.070 --> 25:59.650
You-You would tell me,right?
You don't know where Lux is.

26:01.720 --> 26:04.440
Sam?

26:09.880 --> 26:11.650
Have you checked Tasha's apartment?

26:11.650 --> 26:14.600
Why would Lux be at Tasha's
apartment? She wouldn't be there alone.

26:15.190 --> 26:17.220
I didn't say she was alone.

28:01.740 --> 28:04.400
Come on in.

28:08.450 --> 28:10.100
- Uh... hey.
- Where is he?

28:10.230 --> 28:13.530
- What? Where's who?
- Are you kidding me,Lux?

28:14.460 --> 28:19.190
No. What... Sam
- he told us everything. About you and Mr. Daniels.

28:19.220 --> 28:22.380
Mr. Daniels,as in
my...my tutor,Mr.Daniels?

28:22.380 --> 28:26.510
Mr. Daniels,as in the guy who stood in my
loft on Thanksgiving,lying to our faces.

28:26.510 --> 28:29.060
You know,the guy that I thanked today
for taking such good care of you? Lux?

28:29.060 --> 28:31.990
- What?No,Cate!
- Are you dating him?

28:32.940 --> 28:35.040
Sam is lying,okay?

28:35.620 --> 28:40.380
Lux and I have been...
seeing each other.

28:40.810 --> 28:43.300
It started before I even
knew that she was a student.

28:43.780 --> 28:47.470
I met her downstairs at the
bar the night of the fire.

28:49.050 --> 28:51.330
I took her to see the ocean.

28:51.810 --> 28:54.280
It's not true. Whatever
Sam said,it's not true.

28:54.310 --> 28:56.970
Why don't we ask Sam? Because
he's downstairs in my car.

28:57.390 --> 29:00.360
He's just gonna lie again.
You can't believe him,okay?

29:00.360 --> 29:04.470
He hates Mr. Daniels because he's failing
his class,and he's pissed at me because...

29:04.900 --> 29:06.060
because I don't like him.

29:06.060 --> 29:09.350
I mean,he tried to blackmail me
into kissing him on Thanksgiving.

29:09.770 --> 29:12.370
- With what?
- What?

29:12.850 --> 29:15.560
I mean,when somebody is
blackmailing you,generally,

29:15.560 --> 29:18.560
that means that they know something
that you don't want other people to know.

29:20.090 --> 29:24.060
That... That Jones
and I have been dating.

29:24.760 --> 29:27.080
- Behind Tasha's back?
- Yes.

29:27.080 --> 29:28.660
And Sam is jealous.

29:28.660 --> 29:31.120
That-That is who all of
this is for is for Jones.

29:31.120 --> 29:34.440
That's why I wanted to leave the house.
That's why I didn't want you to drive me.

29:34.690 --> 29:38.010
I
- I'm sorry. But you know what? We should... we should go.

29:38.400 --> 29:42.080
And we should go,before Jones shows
up and feels really stupid,okay?

29:42.320 --> 29:44.520
All right? Let's just... let's just go.

29:44.520 --> 29:49.450
******

29:52.310 --> 29:55.210
Lux,get back here. We are
still talking about this.

29:55.210 --> 29:56.670
No,we're not.

29:56.670 --> 29:58.250
Maybe-Maybe Sam was
lying. Maybe she didn't.

29:58.250 --> 30:00.120
What? ! You're the one
that said he wasn't!

30:00.280 --> 30:02.630
It's really great to know that you
guys would believe some dirt bag kid

30:02.630 --> 30:03.790
who you barely know over...

30:03.790 --> 30:11.060
- Lux?
- Eric.

30:13.720 --> 30:16.750
I told Math. About us. About...

30:17.020 --> 30:18.640
- Are you kidding me?
- Baze,stop!

30:18.880 --> 30:19.800
It is done.

30:19.800 --> 30:21.730
You are going to be fired,I'm
gonna get you arrested,

30:21.730 --> 30:23.340
thrown into jail,put
on one of those lists.

30:23.340 --> 30:25.490
- Let go of him!
- Let people know what a freak you are.

30:25.490 --> 30:26.940
- Baze! Wait.
- Not like this,man.

30:26.970 --> 30:30.700
I swear to God,if you ever touch
her,I will beat you senseless.

30:34.720 --> 30:38.020
I never meant for this to happen.
I never meant for it to go this far.

30:40.130 --> 30:44.900
- So whatever you choose to do,I deserve it.
- You're right. You do deserve it.

30:45.340 --> 30:47.970
I'm gonna call the police. And whatever
life you have,you consider it over.

30:48.430 --> 30:52.480
No,Baze. Okay,look,this...
this is not Eric's fault.

30:52.480 --> 30:57.460
Yes,it is. You... You knew
what she had been through.

30:57.760 --> 31:01.240
All right,you knew what happened to
her. You were supposed to be her teacher,

31:01.410 --> 31:05.880
not some sicko who takes advantage of a
kid who wouldn't know a healthy relationship

31:05.880 --> 31:07.540
if she was sitting next
to it in study hall.

31:07.540 --> 31:10.610
What,like you do? You don't
know... You don't know anything.

31:10.610 --> 31:14.690
You don't know anything about
me and Eric or our relationship!

31:14.690 --> 31:17.690
But why would you? You don't know anything
about your own relationship,either.

31:18.140 --> 31:21.620
- Enlighten me.
- Emma.

31:22.980 --> 31:25.250
She had an affair with your dad.

31:42.180 --> 31:44.280
Lux,what... what are you talking about?

31:44.280 --> 31:46.370
It's exactly what I said. Emma
- she,uh...

31:46.370 --> 31:48.650
she had an affair with your
dad when you two weren't dating.

31:48.650 --> 31:50.720
Okay,Lux,stop. Stop lying.

31:50.720 --> 31:53.390
We know that you are angry,but
you cannot take this out on Baze.

31:53.600 --> 31:55.660
I'm not lying,Cate.

32:00.680 --> 32:03.550
- Why are you making this up?
- How could I make this up?

32:04.080 --> 32:06.760
Why do you think that she
was so reluctant to date you?

32:06.760 --> 32:10.710
Why do you think that your dad got so angry
at Thanksgiving that he threatened to fire you?

32:10.710 --> 32:13.660
I mean,come on. It's kind of
a red flag,don't you think?

32:23.430 --> 32:26.850
Baze. Wait up. Wait up.

32:29.100 --> 32:31.760
- I should go.
- No. Eric,no.

32:31.760 --> 32:35.030
No,Lux. Yes,he should go. Lux?

32:35.420 --> 32:38.060
No! No! Look,Cate! I can...
I can explain things,okay?

32:38.400 --> 32:39.770
We-We can explain things.

32:39.770 --> 32:44.670
There doesn't have to be any-any police
or-or school boards or whatever else,okay?

32:44.670 --> 32:47.480
- I can fix things.
- Lux,we can't fix it! We can't fix it,Lux.

32:50.480 --> 32:52.620
I told Math because I had to blow it up.

32:52.620 --> 32:54.640
I
- I don't want to do this anymore,okay?

32:55.010 --> 32:57.030
I don't want to be a
person who does this.

32:58.640 --> 32:59.630
Eric,please,please.

33:00.030 --> 33:03.710
- Lux. Lux. No. Lux.
- No! This is all your fault!

33:03.940 --> 33:06.390
What? Lux!

33:06.710 --> 33:09.410
If you hadust left things alone,if
you hadn't gone to Valerie's,then,

33:09.660 --> 33:11.920
then I wouldn't have gone,and Tasha
wouldn't have gotten in trouble,

33:11.920 --> 33:13.600
and there never would've been a trial.

33:13.600 --> 33:15.320
Yes,then what,Lux? Huh?

33:15.320 --> 33:17.290
You would still be having some
secret affair with your teacher?

33:17.290 --> 33:19.150
Because that is so not okay.

33:19.150 --> 33:21.550
What is not okay? That he was
there for me when you weren't?

33:21.750 --> 33:24.550
Where the hell have you been? He
is the one who helped me in school.

33:24.550 --> 33:26.790
He is the one who figured there
was something wrong with me.

33:26.790 --> 33:28.470
You know something,Lux? I
have been trying to help you.

33:28.470 --> 33:31.270
- I have been trying to be here for you.
- What have you been trying to do?

33:31.680 --> 33:33.550
Baby-proof the place
like a crazy person,

33:33.740 --> 33:38.290
maniacally trying to protect this unborn kid
because you feel guilty that you couldn't protect me!

33:38.290 --> 33:41.510
Okay,listen to me! I cannot
apologize for this anymore.

33:41.510 --> 33:45.300
I am so sorry that I wasn't there.

33:47.300 --> 33:50.130
I am not talking about
the last 16 years,Cate.

33:50.130 --> 33:52.030
Where have you been the past few months?

33:54.070 --> 33:55.950
Fighting with Ryan,trying
to have another kid.

33:56.160 --> 33:58.210
- Eric has been there for me when you haven't.
- Hey,you know something?

33:58.630 --> 34:01.480
You cannot say that I haven't been
there,because I have been here.

34:01.910 --> 34:05.070
Everything
- every single thing I have done since you have come back into my life

34:05.070 --> 34:06.770
has been for you.

34:08.870 --> 34:11.780
- Whatever.
- Whatever"?

34:12.489 --> 34:15.020
No. I rushed to marry Ryan for you.

34:15.020 --> 34:16.739
To give you the life that you wanted.

34:16.739 --> 34:20.670
I took a job that I didn't even want for
our family,and I have paid for doctors,

34:20.920 --> 34:24.000
and teachers and specialists.
But you know what?

34:24.340 --> 34:28.800
No matter what I do,nothing keeps you
from throwing what I didn't do in my face.

34:28.989 --> 34:30.860
Lux,I know that I wasn't
there to protect you.

34:30.860 --> 34:34.440
I did not protect you from Trey hurting
you,or Valerie turning her back on you,

34:34.440 --> 34:38.230
but I can be there to protect you from
Eric,and that is exactly what I am doing.

34:38.230 --> 34:40.510
No,I don't need protection from him.

34:40.739 --> 34:43.360
Stop treating me like
a kid,don't you get it?

34:43.949 --> 34:46.630
You have done more
damage to me than he has.

34:46.960 --> 34:50.780
Okay,the fact that you even think that,that
you don't see how wrong this whole situation is,

34:51.000 --> 34:52.880
it just proves what a child you are.

34:53.290 --> 34:54.989
So you can stay here,or
you can come home with me,

34:54.989 --> 35:00.460
but let me just make one thing clear to
you: You are never seeing Eric Daniels again.

35:08.930 --> 35:11.130
Because I am your mother.

35:32.470 --> 35:33.550
Hey.

35:39.700 --> 35:43.210
- You didn't make that much progress.
- Yeah.

35:44.840 --> 35:46.880
Turns out it wasn't worth the effort.

35:49.280 --> 35:52.200
Wait. Is that beer?

35:52.990 --> 35:56.440
Sam. Could you give
your mom and I a sec?

36:04.810 --> 36:14.210
- Hey,Baze? Thanks for the basement.
- Yeah. Sure.

36:24.260 --> 36:29.440
What happened? Did he do something?

36:30.480 --> 36:32.730
w long did it last?

36:34.180 --> 36:35.770
What?

36:36.500 --> 36:42.330
The affair. With my dad.
How long did it last?

36:48.120 --> 36:50.470
Four years.

36:54.710 --> 36:59.740
It's,it's... over. It ended a year ago.

37:03.470 --> 37:05.910
And then you just started dating me?

37:08.370 --> 37:13.970
We... We fell in love. It's
not like I,I planned it.

37:14.300 --> 37:18.610
- It's not like I meant to,it...
- What are you talking about?

37:19.480 --> 37:23.940
- With me or my dad?
- I meant you.

37:27.190 --> 37:28.880
Were you going to tell me?

37:33.180 --> 37:41.000
No. I knew if I did,I would lose you.

37:51.270 --> 37:58.480
Yeah. Right. You just did.

38:23.130 --> 38:24.120
Hey,hey,hey!

38:26.460 --> 38:28.960
It's all right. It's all right.

38:30.120 --> 38:33.860
No,you told me that I was pushing her too
hard,but I knew that something was wrong.

38:33.860 --> 38:38.750
No,no,Cate. I was
wrong. Okay? I was wrong.

38:39.030 --> 38:41.520
That you knew something
wasn't right,I...

38:43.140 --> 38:45.200
I never should have told
you what to do with Lux,okay?

38:45.200 --> 38:47.370
You know better than I
do how to protect her.

38:51.530 --> 38:53.740
If I do what I think I have to do...

38:56.630 --> 38:58.780
she's going to hate me
more than she already does.

39:00.200 --> 39:03.230
Maybe that's the price you
have to pay to protect your kid.

39:16.150 --> 39:19.090
Yeah,it's Baze.

39:32.220 --> 39:36.580
Okay. So,um,here's what's going to happen:
You are going to resign from your job,

39:37.590 --> 39:40.970
you're going to pack your bags and you
are going to leave town immediately.

39:41.780 --> 39:47.020
Okay. And if you ever make contact with
our daughter again,we go to the police.

39:48.300 --> 39:49.920
Okay?

39:50.360 --> 39:55.800
I understand. Um,uh,wait.
Uh... I want you guys to know...

39:58.470 --> 40:02.170
that I love her. I,I know
what I did,there's no excuse.

40:05.240 --> 40:07.300
But I do love her.

40:13.150 --> 40:18.230
Um,I know that I-I can't
say good-bye,but,um...

40:19.820 --> 40:23.490
this is her Christmas present.
I got it after that camping trip.

40:25.150 --> 40:28.380
I mean,you guys don't have to give
it to her now,you know,or ever.

40:28.770 --> 40:32.270
But it's to,uh,teach her what I should
have taught her in the first place.

40:33.570 --> 40:35.810
To find her way without me.
