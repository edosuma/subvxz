WEBVTT

00:01.890 --> 00:04.760
15 years is a long time
to be in a coma.

00:04.800 --> 00:06.730
Things might not be
the way you remember.

00:06.770 --> 00:09.600
Well, as long as I can still
rent movies from blockbuster

00:09.630 --> 00:12.370
and find work as a travel agent,
I'll be totally fine.

00:13.770 --> 00:15.610
Mainly, I'm just excited
to do this.

00:21.210 --> 00:24.980
Ah! Ha! Oh!

00:27.790 --> 00:29.750
Uhh!

00:31.000 --> 00:37.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:39.970 --> 00:42.230
Detective Geils,
you've done very well

00:42.270 --> 00:45.840
on the written portion of
your lieutenant training exam.

00:45.870 --> 00:47.440
Oh, it's really
the guy I copied from

00:47.470 --> 00:49.240
who deserves all the credit.

00:49.270 --> 00:50.963
Of course, the real measure
of any lieutenant

00:50.980 --> 00:52.610
is how well he does on his feet.

00:52.640 --> 00:56.280
Therefore, I'm assigning you
your first provisional case.

00:56.310 --> 00:58.620
Oh, a jumper.

00:58.650 --> 00:59.980
Nice.

01:00.020 --> 01:02.620
Now get back here
and show me what you got.

01:10.960 --> 01:12.760
Tribeca, Tanner, get...

01:16.330 --> 01:19.540
Tribeca, Tanner,
get the hell in here!

01:19.570 --> 01:22.340
You wanted to see us,
lieutenant?

01:22.370 --> 01:23.770
For the purposes of this case,

01:23.810 --> 01:26.540
detective Geils will be acting
as lieutenant.

01:26.580 --> 01:28.580
A sub?
Can't we just watch a movie?

01:28.610 --> 01:30.410
Can I go to the bathroom?
It's an emergency.

01:30.450 --> 01:32.880
Now, now!
I expect you to afford him

01:32.920 --> 01:34.320
the same respect you afford me.

01:34.350 --> 01:36.820
Do you understand?

01:36.860 --> 01:39.620
Acting lieutenant Geils?

01:39.660 --> 01:41.620
Okay. Hi, guys.

01:41.660 --> 01:43.390
We've got a lot of work
to do today.

01:43.430 --> 01:47.260
Who threw that?

01:48.670 --> 01:50.770
Well, it's mine now.

01:52.840 --> 01:54.570
All right, enough with
the nonsense.

01:54.610 --> 01:57.370
I want you two to head down
to the hospital and figure out

01:57.410 --> 01:59.610
how the hell this guy got dead!

01:59.640 --> 02:02.550
Yes, sir, lieutenant.

02:02.580 --> 02:03.950
Thank you.

02:03.980 --> 02:06.650
Nice one.

02:06.690 --> 02:10.250
I didn't put it down yet.

02:10.289 --> 02:13.390
The emergency room
is closed due to an emergency.

02:13.430 --> 02:15.020
If this is
an actual emergency...

02:15.060 --> 02:17.830
ow! Ow! Ow! Emergency!
Emergency!

02:17.860 --> 02:20.460
What are we looking at, Scholls?

02:20.500 --> 02:21.900
Before we go any further,

02:21.930 --> 02:23.900
I'd like to acknowledge
the elephant in the room.

02:23.940 --> 02:25.370
I've just received
my 2-week chip

02:25.400 --> 02:26.663
from a gambling addiction
program.

02:26.670 --> 02:29.270
That's a casino chip.

02:29.310 --> 02:31.740
So what happened here?
Looks like a suicide.

02:31.780 --> 02:34.040
We have a deceased male,
mid-30s. No I.D.

02:34.080 --> 02:36.750
There's an "a" on his t-shirt, but
we're not sure what it signifies.

02:36.780 --> 02:38.080
Judging by these injuries,

02:38.120 --> 02:39.980
I'd say he fell
from about a thousand feet.

02:40.020 --> 02:42.543
The only wrinkle is, the hospital's
only about a hundred feet tall.

02:42.550 --> 02:44.090
Any chance you got
the height wrong?

02:44.120 --> 02:45.760
Is that just from eyeballing it?

02:45.790 --> 02:47.960
No, it's not from
"eyeballing it." I looked at it.

02:47.990 --> 02:50.460
You don't get these injuries
from a 100-foot fall.

02:50.500 --> 02:52.430
Was just asking.
I'll take him back to the lab

02:52.460 --> 02:54.430
and see what an autopsy
tells us.

02:54.470 --> 02:56.830
And although stock in my opinion
is at an all-time low,

02:56.870 --> 02:59.040
I strongly believe he didn't
jump from this building.

02:59.070 --> 03:01.000
All right, well,
let us know what you find out.

03:01.040 --> 03:03.270
In the meantime, let's keep
this place on lockdown

03:03.310 --> 03:04.840
until we figure out
what happened.

03:20.830 --> 03:22.760
Mmm. What's this?
Blood.

03:22.790 --> 03:24.530
I'm examining the effects
on blood

03:24.560 --> 03:26.560
in the absence
of any atmospheric pressure.

03:26.600 --> 03:28.893
Don't you have any work to do? The
blood in the fall victim's body

03:28.900 --> 03:30.630
was boiled at some point.
Meaning what?

03:30.670 --> 03:32.800
Someone boiled him
and threw him out a window?

03:32.840 --> 03:35.000
It's difficult to explain,
but blood will actually boil

03:35.040 --> 03:36.670
in the absence
of any air pressure...

03:36.710 --> 03:38.940
what's called a "vacuum."

03:38.980 --> 03:41.540
It is my professional opinion
that this man fell from space.

03:41.580 --> 03:43.080
Mm-hmm.

03:43.110 --> 03:44.810
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

03:44.850 --> 03:46.950
Okay. Cool.

03:46.990 --> 03:48.783
Monica, I know things have been
kinda rough on you,

03:48.790 --> 03:50.590
so if you're still
not feeling well...

03:50.620 --> 03:54.060
Look, I know it sounds crazy,

03:54.090 --> 03:55.783
but if there's one thing I know,
it's blood and guts

03:55.790 --> 03:57.493
and what happens to them
when they've been shot,

03:57.500 --> 03:58.953
bludgeoned, stabbed,
poisoned, strangled, burned,

03:58.960 --> 04:00.530
and in one case, caramelized.

04:00.570 --> 04:02.530
And I'm telling you
that someone dropped that man

04:02.570 --> 04:04.130
from over 50 miles
into the atmosphere.

04:12.110 --> 04:14.810
Tribeca, Tanner, get in here!

04:22.120 --> 04:24.520
It is of the opinion

04:24.560 --> 04:26.720
of the department
forensic specialist

04:26.760 --> 04:28.453
that the man found this morning
in front of the hospital

04:28.460 --> 04:30.630
fell from
an extremely great height.

04:30.660 --> 04:32.060
Like a tall building?

04:32.100 --> 04:33.800
Even more extreme.

04:33.830 --> 04:35.100
Like from an airplane?

04:35.130 --> 04:38.000
Like crazy, loco extreme.

04:38.040 --> 04:40.140
Like a... Spaceship?

04:41.770 --> 04:43.870
Acting lieutenant Geils,
isn't there a point

04:43.910 --> 04:45.810
when these cases become
so far-fetched

04:45.840 --> 04:47.480
that they're hard to believe?

04:47.510 --> 04:49.980
It's typical for the genre,
Tribeca.

04:50.010 --> 04:51.680
Now get your butts to NASA

04:51.720 --> 04:53.780
and tell me how the hell
this guy fell out of the sky.

04:53.820 --> 04:56.120
NASA, like in Florida?

04:56.150 --> 04:58.550
No, NASA in Houston.

04:58.590 --> 05:00.660
So NASA in Houston?

05:00.690 --> 05:02.020
Yeah.

05:02.060 --> 05:03.690
Got it.

05:06.060 --> 05:07.530
How am I doing, lieutenant?

05:07.570 --> 05:10.100
Considering what you've
been given?

05:10.130 --> 05:13.700
Awful. Just awful.
I have no faith.

05:24.630 --> 05:26.670
One minute to launch.

05:26.700 --> 05:28.670
Two hours to lunch.

05:28.700 --> 05:30.340
Excuse me. Ms. craft?

05:30.370 --> 05:32.340
Oh, hello. Welcome.

05:32.370 --> 05:36.440
And it's "missus." I'm married.
Obviously.

05:36.480 --> 05:39.280
I'm sorry. I'm afraid you've
caught us at a bit of a busy time.

05:39.310 --> 05:40.810
We're about to launch
a satellite

05:40.850 --> 05:43.850
that will be able to go
around and around the earth.

05:43.890 --> 05:46.320
Telemetry!
Go!

05:46.350 --> 05:47.950
Engines!
Go!

05:47.990 --> 05:50.020
Thunderbirds!
Are go!

05:50.060 --> 05:52.360
Go, speed racer!
Go!

05:52.390 --> 05:53.790
I'm sorry. You were saying?

05:53.830 --> 05:56.030
A dead body fell
to the ground in Los Angeles,

05:56.060 --> 05:58.900
and, uh...
What's a nice way to put this?

05:58.930 --> 06:01.870
A lunatic that I work with
has a theory...

06:01.900 --> 06:03.570
It's just so embarrassing...

06:03.600 --> 06:06.270
Can an astronaut fall
from one of your spaceships?

06:06.310 --> 06:08.370
Yeah, right.

06:08.410 --> 06:11.710
And one day, you'll be able
to say "shit" on television.

06:14.050 --> 06:15.880
And besides, we haven't even
sent anyone up

06:15.920 --> 06:18.920
in the past six months.

06:20.920 --> 06:22.860
I'm so sorry.
Is this gonna get you

06:22.890 --> 06:26.790
in trouble with your boss?
Oh, he's not my boss.

06:26.830 --> 06:28.530
My boss is another man.
Mm.

06:28.560 --> 06:29.800
Anyway, thank you for your time.

06:29.830 --> 06:31.430
Let's go, Tanner.
10...

06:31.470 --> 06:33.070
Wait a minute, detectives.
...9...

06:33.100 --> 06:35.500
You won't want to miss this.
...8, 7,

06:35.540 --> 06:38.770
6, 5, 4,

06:38.810 --> 06:42.010
3, 2, 1.

06:47.350 --> 06:49.850
Boys! Cookies!

06:59.030 --> 07:01.560
Oh, these are for the men.

07:01.600 --> 07:04.060
I'll get you a fresca
and a diet pill later.

07:04.100 --> 07:05.970
You know, actually,

07:06.000 --> 07:08.530
if I'm remembering right,

07:08.570 --> 07:11.800
we did register a rocket launch
out of California yesterday,

07:11.840 --> 07:14.570
from one of those
space tourism companies.

07:14.610 --> 07:15.980
Hmm.

07:20.110 --> 07:22.410
Ooh!

07:22.450 --> 07:25.950
We must have it in here
somewhere.

07:25.990 --> 07:27.450
Here it is.

07:27.490 --> 07:28.720
Galaxium aerospace.

07:28.760 --> 07:30.120
Not sure who was on board,

07:30.160 --> 07:32.360
but would you like me to make
a mimeograph?

07:32.390 --> 07:34.093
I'll just take a picture.
Oh, just take the card.

07:34.100 --> 07:37.460
I don't want you to have to wait
for the film to be developed.

07:37.500 --> 07:38.930
Thanks.

07:38.970 --> 07:40.930
Would you like me to take that
for you?

07:40.970 --> 07:42.940
Sure.
Have a great day.

07:50.710 --> 07:53.450
Galaxium aerospace is
the pet project

07:53.480 --> 07:58.650
of bad boy, playboy, rock star
C.E.O. Sperber Pennington.

07:58.690 --> 08:01.390
Is that the idiot that went over
Niagara Falls on a horse?

08:01.420 --> 08:03.060
That's him.

08:03.090 --> 08:05.120
Total adrenaline junkie.

08:05.160 --> 08:06.660
Well, let's see
if the police showing up

08:06.690 --> 08:07.960
gets his engine running.

08:30.050 --> 08:31.780
Mr. Pennington?

08:31.820 --> 08:34.090
Angie Tribeca, L.A.P.D.

08:37.460 --> 08:40.059
What's up, detective?
You caught me.

08:40.090 --> 08:42.090
I'm collecting
some California condor eggs

08:42.130 --> 08:44.900
for an omelette.
This is an unusual request,

08:44.930 --> 08:48.000
but we're investigating
the possibility of a passenger

08:48.040 --> 08:51.940
from one of your space flights
falling overboard.

08:51.970 --> 08:56.880
What?!
A passenger fell overboard?

08:56.910 --> 08:59.080
From one of my space flights?!

09:04.420 --> 09:06.050
Are you serious?!

09:06.090 --> 09:08.020
You just made
my whole millennia.

09:08.060 --> 09:09.990
You should come work for me!

09:10.020 --> 09:12.990
You could be
my vice president of joy.

09:13.030 --> 09:14.790
So I take it that you...

09:14.830 --> 09:16.500
So you're saying
that you can account for

09:16.530 --> 09:18.500
every single passenger
on that flight?

09:18.530 --> 09:19.900
Absolutely.
Thanks.

09:19.930 --> 09:22.730
I think we got what we needed.
Sorry to both you.

09:24.810 --> 09:26.810
Is... aah!

09:29.480 --> 09:30.980
It's an embarrassment.

09:31.010 --> 09:33.910
It's completely humiliating,
and it's beneath you.

09:33.950 --> 09:35.580
It's just a turtleneck, Tribeca.

09:35.620 --> 09:36.850
What are we doin'?

09:36.880 --> 09:39.150
Everybody's looking at us
like we crazy.

09:39.190 --> 09:41.190
Why don't we just say
he fell from a hot air balloon

09:41.220 --> 09:42.720
and call it a day?

09:42.760 --> 09:44.260
This is my first case
as lieutenant,

09:44.290 --> 09:46.160
and I want it solved correctly.

09:46.190 --> 09:48.090
Maybe your first job
as lieutenant

09:48.130 --> 09:51.230
should be to figure out if your
head of forensics is bonkers.

09:51.270 --> 09:53.570
That's it. You're staying
on campus for lunch.

09:54.940 --> 09:56.940
This case is making
the department look bad.

09:56.970 --> 09:58.900
Chasing after spaceships...

09:58.940 --> 10:00.710
I'm just sayin',

10:00.740 --> 10:03.780
hot air balloon accidents
happen all the time!

10:03.810 --> 10:05.510
Lieutenant, a little help here?

10:05.550 --> 10:08.010
If I intervene, you'll fail
this portion of the exam.

10:09.550 --> 10:13.190
Well, then maybe I'm not ready
to be a lieutenant, lieutenant.

10:13.220 --> 10:14.790
Lieutenant.

10:19.060 --> 10:20.330
Tanner...

10:20.360 --> 10:22.230
Get the balloon paperwork.

10:22.260 --> 10:23.800
That's what I'm talkin' about.

10:23.830 --> 10:26.230
I'll deal with
our forensics problem.

10:26.270 --> 10:27.800
Dr. Scholls?
Yes?

10:27.840 --> 10:29.330
We need...
I've identified our victim.

10:29.370 --> 10:31.140
His name was Allen Fresco.

10:31.170 --> 10:33.270
Missing persons report filed
yesterday morning.

10:33.310 --> 10:35.210
And that proves...

10:35.240 --> 10:37.010
He was an engineer
at acme rocket parts,

10:37.040 --> 10:38.610
hence the "A" on his shirt.

10:38.650 --> 10:41.080
Your point is...

10:41.120 --> 10:44.020
Acme rocket parts was a subcontractor
for Galaxium aerospace.

10:44.050 --> 10:46.820
They built the windshields on
the Galaxium I spaceship.

10:46.850 --> 10:51.090
And that's important because...

10:51.130 --> 10:52.720
Look what I found in his pocket.

10:54.900 --> 10:57.200
Tang.

10:57.230 --> 10:59.770
He was on that ship.

11:09.640 --> 11:12.010
When's the last time you saw
Allen Fresco?

11:12.050 --> 11:13.810
I saw Al two days ago.

11:13.850 --> 11:16.120
We were still working on the fix
for the faulty windshields.

11:16.150 --> 11:18.580
You know, the glass
in the front of the...

11:18.620 --> 11:20.090
I may not be
a rocket scientist, sir,

11:20.120 --> 11:22.220
but I know what
you're talking about.

11:22.260 --> 11:24.090
Now the windshield,

11:24.120 --> 11:26.020
which powers the vehicle,

11:26.060 --> 11:28.030
you said that they were unsafe?

11:28.060 --> 11:30.830
Only unsafe in the sense that
the windshield would crack apart

11:30.860 --> 11:32.700
the second you left
the atmosphere.

11:32.730 --> 11:35.000
Al told them over and over again
it wasn't ready,

11:35.040 --> 11:37.140
but that lunatic Pennington
wouldn't listen.

11:39.140 --> 11:41.670
The last time I talked to him,
he said he was going to Galaxium

11:41.710 --> 11:43.040
to try and reason
with Pennington.

11:43.080 --> 11:45.640
And if that didn't work,
he would go to the press.

11:45.680 --> 11:47.980
You gotta understand,
Al was a perfectionist.

11:48.020 --> 11:50.420
Even one ship exploding
would've bothered him.

11:50.450 --> 11:54.020
Thanks, Dave.
We'll be in touch.

12:04.260 --> 12:06.230
Salutations, detectives.

12:06.270 --> 12:09.370
And how are your ways?
Sit down, Mr. Pennington,

12:09.400 --> 12:11.740
and keep your new age jargon
to a minimum.

12:11.770 --> 12:13.640
Oh. Okay.

12:13.670 --> 12:15.670
May I ask, what was so important

12:15.710 --> 12:17.180
that you had to pull me off
Kate Upton?

12:17.210 --> 12:19.850
What does the name Allen Fresco
mean to you?

12:19.880 --> 12:22.750
Nothing.
What about acme rocket parts?

12:22.780 --> 12:24.650
Acme rocket parts manufactures

12:24.690 --> 12:26.990
certain components
for the Galaxium I spacebus.

12:27.020 --> 12:29.960
Like the faulty windshield?
Look, detective,

12:29.990 --> 12:32.060
Galaxium leads the industry
in safety.

12:32.090 --> 12:35.090
We're tied with the only other
company that does this.

12:35.130 --> 12:38.360
That's funny,
'cause the engineers at acme,

12:38.400 --> 12:40.930
they had major concerns about
that windshield.

12:42.300 --> 12:44.740
Allen Fresco's an idiot.

12:44.770 --> 12:48.070
And if I knew who that was,
I would tell him to his face.

12:48.110 --> 12:50.140
Was Allen Fresco on that flight?

12:50.180 --> 12:53.410
No. Absolutely not. Did Rachel
not get you the manifest?

12:53.450 --> 12:55.280
We've seen the manifest,

12:55.320 --> 12:58.820
and we contacted
every single person on there!

12:58.850 --> 13:01.390
And?

13:01.420 --> 13:02.890
And they all agree

13:02.920 --> 13:04.860
that there was no Allen Fresco
on that flight.

13:04.890 --> 13:07.030
Oh, thank god.
But...

13:07.060 --> 13:09.260
They all said your behavior
on the flight

13:09.300 --> 13:11.760
was nervous and agitated

13:11.800 --> 13:14.700
and that you entered and exited
the bathroom several times,

13:14.740 --> 13:17.440
completely ignoring
the "out of order" sign.

13:17.470 --> 13:22.210
So... You brought me in here
to talk about a broken bathroom?

13:22.240 --> 13:24.340
They also heard an airlock open,

13:24.380 --> 13:29.180
then screams,
then the airlock shut again.

13:29.220 --> 13:32.420
So... You brought me in here to
talk about an airlock opening

13:32.450 --> 13:35.020
and then some screaming
and then an airlock shutting?

13:35.060 --> 13:37.460
I think you pushed Allen Fresco
off that flight

13:37.490 --> 13:39.460
because you were afraid
he was gonna go to press

13:39.490 --> 13:41.330
with his safety concerns
about the Galaxium.

13:41.360 --> 13:43.860
And that's something your
stock prices couldn't afford.

13:43.900 --> 13:46.030
Am I right, Mr. Pennington?

13:46.070 --> 13:49.000
Look, if you want
to get a prosecutor

13:49.040 --> 13:51.970
and tell that prosecutor
that Sperber Pennington,

13:52.010 --> 13:54.470
the guy that lived inside
of an orca for three weeks,

13:54.510 --> 13:56.740
pushed a man
out of his spaceship

13:56.780 --> 13:59.810
without any evidence
or witnesses whatsoever?

13:59.850 --> 14:03.220
Then you are a bigger daredevil
than I am.

14:03.250 --> 14:04.780
Shalom.

14:06.150 --> 14:08.390
Kickstand up.

14:13.330 --> 14:16.260
It's just a tight turn is all.

14:29.480 --> 14:31.980
Adios.

14:32.010 --> 14:33.310
Ah! Damn it.

14:33.350 --> 14:37.080
Just the acceleration is
a little... Tricky.

14:37.120 --> 14:37.620
Here we go.

14:38.520 --> 14:41.120
No. Yeah.
There we go.

14:47.990 --> 14:49.313
So I don't know if
you've heard yet,

14:49.320 --> 14:50.990
but it sounds like
this spaceship theory

14:51.020 --> 14:53.890
isn't crazy after all.
Yeah, I heard.

14:53.930 --> 14:56.160
Just wanted to say I'm sorry.

14:56.190 --> 14:58.260
I think there's someone else
you owe an apology.

14:58.300 --> 15:00.730
Forget about it, Tribeca. I
wouldn't have believed it, either.

15:00.770 --> 15:02.123
But I think there's someone
who deserves

15:02.130 --> 15:03.493
a little thanks
for putting all together.

15:03.500 --> 15:06.770
Hey, man, all in a day's work.

15:06.810 --> 15:08.940
I'm proud of you all.

15:08.970 --> 15:12.280
So what's our next move,
acting lieutenant Geils?

15:12.310 --> 15:14.310
Thanks, lieutenant.

15:14.350 --> 15:18.010
Okay. Well, we've already connected
Al Fresco to Pennington.

15:18.050 --> 15:21.180
We just need physical evidence
that Fresco was on that ship.

15:21.220 --> 15:22.583
What judge is gonna
give us a warrant

15:22.590 --> 15:24.790
based on the facts of this case?

15:24.820 --> 15:26.120
You don't need a judge

15:26.160 --> 15:28.260
when you've got a lieutenant
who bends the rules.

15:28.290 --> 15:29.990
Now you're starting to get it.

15:30.030 --> 15:31.360
Someone's gotta
get on that ship,

15:31.400 --> 15:34.130
someone that Pennington's
never met.

15:56.590 --> 15:58.520
Now remember,
we're just two rich kids

15:58.560 --> 16:02.130
blowing their family's wealth
on a 20-minute trip to space.

16:02.160 --> 16:04.060
Copy that.

16:04.100 --> 16:05.800
Afternoon, folks.

16:05.830 --> 16:07.563
This is your captain speaking.
That chime you just heard

16:07.570 --> 16:11.900
indicates that we have left
earth's atmosphere.

16:11.940 --> 16:14.300
Feel free to relax,
unbuckle those seat belts,

16:14.340 --> 16:17.940
and enjoy all the wonders
of zero gravity.

16:20.180 --> 16:21.910
Our movie today,
"the secret life of pets,"

16:21.950 --> 16:24.010
will begin shortly.

16:37.900 --> 16:40.460
You seen that movie?
It's really funny.

17:33.990 --> 17:35.420
What's up?

17:35.450 --> 17:37.520
There's no doubt Fresco's body
was in that bathroom.

17:37.560 --> 17:40.190
I found his wallet, one of his
shoes, his Pokemon collection,

17:40.230 --> 17:42.330
and what must have been
his lucky chloroform rag.

17:42.360 --> 17:44.360
We've got Pennington
dead to rights.

17:44.400 --> 17:47.660
I'm sorry.
Who's got who dead to rights?

17:52.440 --> 17:54.370
Galaxium I, this is Houston.

17:54.410 --> 17:56.940
Come in.

17:56.980 --> 17:58.540
They're not responding.

17:58.580 --> 18:01.440
I don't like this.

18:03.580 --> 18:07.350
Miss craft, I hate to even raise
this possibility, but...

18:07.390 --> 18:10.650
Can any of these monitors
show normal TV?

18:10.690 --> 18:13.090
I'm afraid not.

18:13.120 --> 18:15.190
I knew it.

18:15.230 --> 18:17.990
Valium?

18:19.360 --> 18:21.000
You shoot that gun,
you'll kill us all.

18:21.030 --> 18:23.230
I think you're forgetting about
the escape pod.

18:23.270 --> 18:26.970
But unfortunately,
there's only room for one.

18:27.010 --> 18:29.410
Sorry, Marty.

18:38.620 --> 18:40.980
Houston?

18:41.020 --> 18:42.520
Glulls...

18:42.550 --> 18:44.550
Geils!

18:44.590 --> 18:47.020
This is Houston.
Go ahead, Galaxium.

18:47.060 --> 18:50.260
Uh, Houston, we have
a bad thing happening.

18:50.300 --> 18:53.600
Geils, what do you need?
Talk to me.

18:53.630 --> 18:55.030
I need you to tell me

18:55.070 --> 18:57.030
I would've made
a good lieutenant.

18:57.070 --> 19:00.340
You're gonna make
a great lieutenant.

19:00.370 --> 19:02.670
You're coming home.
You wouldn't be saying that

19:02.710 --> 19:04.640
if you were seeing
what I'm seeing.

19:04.680 --> 19:07.510
Scholls is trying to wrestle
the gun away from Pennington.

19:07.550 --> 19:10.150
She's holding her own, but...

19:10.180 --> 19:12.013
Oh, he was only using one arm.
Now he's using two.

19:12.020 --> 19:14.280
She's good.
Why isn't anyone helping her?

19:14.320 --> 19:17.420
Tell our son I love him.

19:17.460 --> 19:18.990
No.

19:19.020 --> 19:20.590
You're gonna tell him yourself,

19:20.630 --> 19:23.360
when he gets home from
boarding school in six years.

19:25.430 --> 19:29.330
Tribeca?
I'm here.

19:29.370 --> 19:31.000
I loved being your partner.

19:31.040 --> 19:32.540
Geils...

19:37.740 --> 19:39.710
Aah!
Oh, shit!

19:39.740 --> 19:41.343
The windshield just cracked,
and Pennington got sucked out!

19:41.350 --> 19:42.680
We're fine!

19:47.550 --> 19:49.750
Scholls, tape a blanket
over the...

19:49.790 --> 19:51.350
oh, good!
You're already doing it!

19:51.390 --> 19:53.590
Initiating auto-return system.

19:53.630 --> 19:56.290
See you guys in 10!

19:56.330 --> 19:57.690
These are the moments
I'm gonna miss

19:57.730 --> 20:01.360
when I get fired
for being a mom.

20:10.280 --> 20:11.840
I passed.

20:11.880 --> 20:14.380
Does that mean I have to start
calling you lieutenant now?

20:14.410 --> 20:17.580
I passed the first of 300 cases
I have to oversee.

20:17.620 --> 20:20.620
Oh. Well, that's still
pretty good.

20:20.650 --> 20:22.790
So I guess this
spending time apart thing

20:22.820 --> 20:25.860
is becoming more permanent, huh?

20:25.890 --> 20:28.360
Seems like that's
for the best right now.

20:28.390 --> 20:31.490
Okay, partner.

20:31.530 --> 20:34.630
Happy you're back on earth,
safe and sound.
