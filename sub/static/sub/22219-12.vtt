08:33.647 --> 08:35.181
<b>- Well, that doesn't mean</b>
<b>I'm not gonna shoot at them.</b>

08:35.182 --> 08:36.515
<b>- But you guys have to think,</b>

08:36.517 --> 08:39.085
<b>who's the easiest person</b>
<b>on Nuñez to get out?</b>

08:39.086 --> 08:40.586
<b>- I couldn't care less</b>
<b>about that.</b>

08:40.587 --> 08:42.755
<b>I want to [bleep] shoot</b>
<b>at the best artist.</b>

08:42.756 --> 08:44.891
<b>The girls are strong.</b>

08:44.892 --> 08:46.526
<b>- But I know that</b>
<b>they have my back.</b>

08:46.527 --> 08:49.196
<b>- Doesn't matter who's got</b>
<b>a penis or a vagina today.</b>

08:50.697 --> 08:53.266
<b>It's a team thing,</b>
<b>and we got to work as a team.</b>

08:53.267 --> 08:55.768
<b>Sometimes I don't agree with</b>
<b>what we got to do as a team,</b>

08:55.769 --> 08:57.703
<b>but we just got to go</b>
<b>with it, you know?</b>

08:57.704 --> 08:59.172
<b>- How about any other guys</b>
<b>in the house</b>

08:59.173 --> 09:00.806
<b>that you have aligned with?</b>

09:00.807 --> 09:04.377
<b>- I try to align with everybody</b>
<b>that wants to do an alliance,</b>

09:04.378 --> 09:05.778
<b>but it's hard in this one,</b>

09:05.779 --> 09:08.080
<b>especially 'cause the girls</b>
<b>are together.</b>

09:08.081 --> 09:10.016
<b>I don't know who else</b>
<b>to do an alliance with.</b>

09:10.017 --> 09:12.585
<b>- You seem to be playing</b>
<b>strategically,</b>

09:12.586 --> 09:14.020
<b>turning out great tattoos.</b>

09:14.021 --> 09:15.454
<b>You haven't been in the bottom.</b>

09:15.455 --> 09:17.423
<b>Do you think that puts a target</b>
<b>on your back a little bit?</b>

09:17.424 --> 09:18.791
<b>- Yeah, definitely.</b>

09:18.792 --> 09:21.494
<b>You got to play the game</b>
<b>and it's strategic game.</b>

09:21.495 --> 09:24.330
<b>I mean, I know everybody's</b>
<b>shooting at me and, you know,</b>

09:24.331 --> 09:26.432
<b>everybody wants to be</b>
<b>in the finale</b>

09:26.433 --> 09:28.034
<b>and everybody wants</b>
<b>to win this thing.</b>

09:28.035 --> 09:32.839
<b>So if I were not me,</b>
<b>I'd be shooting at me, so.</b>

09:32.840 --> 09:34.874
<b>I'm gonna give this one</b>
<b>to you, buddy.</b>

09:34.875 --> 09:37.510
<b>- Gian is a crafty little elf.</b>

09:37.511 --> 09:41.047
<b> <i>I know that he has</i> </b>
<b> <i>something up his sleeve.</i> </b>

09:41.048 --> 09:42.682
<b> <i>He is here to play a game.</i> </b>

09:42.683 --> 09:45.084
<b>Some little puppet master.</b>

09:45.085 --> 09:49.322
<b>- Kelly Doty, Team Nuñez,</b>
<b>top six in the competition.</b>

09:49.323 --> 09:51.090
<b>How does that feel?</b> <b>- Worrisome.</b>

09:51.091 --> 09:52.425
<b>- Why worrisome?</b>

09:52.426 --> 09:54.094
<b>- That's just my go-to emotion.</b>

10:00.300 --> 10:03.436
<b>I live in Salem, Massachusetts.</b>

10:03.437 --> 10:05.671
<b>I just opened up my shop</b>

10:05.672 --> 10:08.975
<b>and now I'm leaving it.</b>

10:08.976 --> 10:10.576
<b>- Don't worry about the shop.</b>
<b>Don't worry about anything.</b>

10:10.577 --> 10:12.778
<b>Just go and do your best.</b>
<b>We'll take care of everything.</b>

10:12.779 --> 10:17.650
<b> <i>- I spent every single penny</i> </b>
<b> <i>I've ever had to build it.</i> </b>

10:17.651 --> 10:21.722
<b>To win $100,000 would</b>
<b>absolutely change my life.</b>

10:22.923 --> 10:24.423
<b>- You're gonna have</b>
<b>five hours to do</b>

10:24.424 --> 10:27.293
<b>as many American</b>
<b>traditional tattoos as you can.</b>

10:27.294 --> 10:28.794
<b>- My butt is clenched.</b>

10:28.795 --> 10:32.398
<b> <i>My tattoo style</i> </b>
<b> <i>is spooky illustrative.</i> </b>

10:32.399 --> 10:35.434
<b> <i>I am one of the people</i> </b>
<b> <i>who has built new school</i> </b>

10:35.435 --> 10:37.203
<b>to what it is today.</b>

10:37.204 --> 10:39.038
<b>Countdown to getting yelled at.</b>

10:39.039 --> 10:42.408
<b>This was the challenge</b>
<b>that I was the most scared for.</b>

10:42.409 --> 10:45.811
<b>- Slick tattoo, not even</b>
<b>near American traditional.</b>

10:45.812 --> 10:47.480
<b> <i>- It's not feed me your style.</i> </b>

10:47.481 --> 10:49.615
<b>- If you don't play the game,</b>
<b>you're [bleep] out.</b>

10:49.616 --> 10:51.484
<b>- Miss Kelly Doty.</b>

10:51.485 --> 10:52.952
<b> <i>Kelly's an amazing artist.</i> </b>

10:52.953 --> 10:54.387
<b> <i>Even though I didn't like</i> </b>
<b> <i>what she showed me</i> </b>

10:54.388 --> 10:56.856
<b> <i>the entire two days</i> </b>
<b> <i>of this whole competition,</i> </b>

10:56.857 --> 10:58.591
<b> <i>I know exactly</i> </b>
<b> <i>what we're looking for.</i> </b>

10:58.592 --> 11:01.294
<b>If they listen, I can give them</b>
<b>the keys to the kingdom.</b>

11:01.295 --> 11:04.063
<b>- Kelly Doty, she's gonna end up</b>
<b>shooting herself</b>

11:04.064 --> 11:05.198
<b>in the foot 'cause...</b>
<b>- I don't think so.</b>

11:05.199 --> 11:06.499
<b>I think she's a fast learner...</b>

11:06.500 --> 11:08.267
<b>- If she does not listen</b>
<b>she's gonna get pfft.</b>

11:08.268 --> 11:10.069
<b>- Do not underestimate Kelly.</b>

11:10.070 --> 11:11.637
<b>- Do not.</b>
<b>- Do not.</b>

11:11.638 --> 11:14.707
<b>- I am a great [bleep] tattooer.</b>
<b>- The reason you're down here</b>

11:14.708 --> 11:16.409
<b> <i>is because of the unfinished</i> </b>
<b> <i>looking tattoo.</i> </b>

11:16.410 --> 11:18.544
<b> <i>- I know that I fell short,</i> </b>

11:18.545 --> 11:22.181
<b>but I gave you</b>
<b>a good [bleep] tattoo.</b>

11:22.182 --> 11:24.283
<b> <i>The pressure for me</i> </b>
<b> <i>to do a really,</i> </b>

11:24.284 --> 11:26.586
<b> <i>really good job</i> </b>
<b> <i>on new school day</i> </b>

11:26.587 --> 11:29.522
<b>is absolutely astronomical.</b>

11:29.523 --> 11:30.957
<b>- This is where</b>
<b>you really shine.</b>

11:30.958 --> 11:32.158
<b>This is a great drawing.</b>

11:32.159 --> 11:33.559
<b> <i>The eyes, the nose, the mouth,</i> </b>

11:33.560 --> 11:35.094
<b> <i>the scratches in his face</i> </b>

11:35.095 --> 11:37.597
<b> <i>and the musculature of the guy</i> </b>
<b> <i>and the skin tone.</i> </b>

11:37.598 --> 11:38.664
<b>It's great tattooing.</b>

11:38.665 --> 11:40.266
<b> <i>- The shading's beautiful.</i> </b>

11:40.267 --> 11:42.969
<b> <i>The detail in the eyes, the</i> </b>
<b> <i>ridge of the nose, the lips.</i> </b>

11:42.970 --> 11:44.971
<b>Everything fits beautifully.</b>

11:44.972 --> 11:46.305
<b>- The judges have decided,</b>

11:46.306 --> 11:50.343
<b>the best tattoo</b>
<b>of the day goes to Kelly.</b>

11:50.344 --> 11:51.644
<b>- Thank you very much.</b>

11:51.645 --> 11:55.414
<b>- The best tattoo of the day</b>
<b>goes to Kelly.</b>

11:55.415 --> 11:56.649
<b>- Thank you.</b>

11:56.650 --> 11:59.018
<b> <i>- Kelly is</i> </b>
<b> <i>a beacon of consistency.</i> </b>

11:59.019 --> 12:00.887
<b>She has a new school style,</b>

12:00.888 --> 12:03.055
<b>but it's different</b>
<b>than everybody else's.</b>

12:03.056 --> 12:04.490
<b> <i>She's got some wins.</i> </b>

12:04.491 --> 12:06.826
<b> <i>She really hasn't taken</i> </b>
<b> <i>any bad losses.</i> </b>

12:06.827 --> 12:08.061
<b>Kelly could go all the way.</b>

12:10.364 --> 12:12.565
<b>- You are excelling</b>
<b>in this competition.</b>

12:12.566 --> 12:14.233
<b>- That's where it</b>
<b>gets really worrisome.</b>

12:14.234 --> 12:16.802
<b>I feel, like,</b>
<b>almost put on a pedestal</b>

12:16.803 --> 12:18.604
<b>and then that's a long way</b>
<b>to fall.</b>

12:18.605 --> 12:22.341
<b>- What's it like working with</b>
<b>Chris Nuñez as your team leader?</b>

12:22.342 --> 12:24.110
<b>- Chris Nuñez scares the crap</b>
<b>out of me and...</b>

12:24.111 --> 12:27.446
<b>- Why's he so scary?</b>
<b>- His eyebrows, he...</b>

12:27.447 --> 12:29.215
<b>- But I mean,</b>
<b>I have scary eyebrows too.</b>

12:29.216 --> 12:31.083
<b>- You have eyebrows like</b>
<b>bat wings.</b>

12:31.084 --> 12:32.451
<b>- Yes.</b>

12:32.452 --> 12:34.120
<b>- He has eyebrows</b>
<b>like a disappointed father.</b>

12:34.121 --> 12:35.888
<b>So there's that.</b>

12:35.889 --> 12:38.457
<b>But it's hard</b>
<b>to get a read on Nuñez.</b>

12:38.458 --> 12:42.094
<b>Sometimes I'll joke with him,</b>
<b>and they do not land.</b>

12:42.095 --> 12:44.096
<b>And then sometimes</b>
<b>he's game for it.</b>

12:44.097 --> 12:47.333
<b>- Plenty of time for you?</b>
<b>- Yeah, just a big, open face.</b>

12:47.334 --> 12:49.402
<b>- Just gonna pack</b>
<b>that face solid white.</b>

12:49.403 --> 12:51.304
<b>- Right? That's how you do it.</b>

12:51.305 --> 12:53.472
<b>Now's not the time for jokes,</b>
<b>I see that now.</b>

12:53.473 --> 12:57.243
<b>He has a lot of different ideas</b>
<b>than I do,</b>

12:57.244 --> 13:01.581
<b>and I have definitely realized</b>
<b>that early on.</b>

13:01.582 --> 13:04.550
<b>I don't know that we see</b>
<b>eye to eye artistically.</b>

13:04.551 --> 13:07.653
<b>- Do you see it as an advantage</b>
<b>to at least be on his team?</b>

13:07.654 --> 13:09.288
<b>He chose you.</b>

13:09.289 --> 13:11.090
<b>- I don't know if it's</b>
<b>an advantage to be on his team</b>

13:11.091 --> 13:12.825
<b>'cause it scares the crap</b>
<b>out of me</b>

13:12.826 --> 13:14.293
<b>every time he talks to me,</b>

13:14.294 --> 13:17.930
<b>and then I've got kind of</b>
<b>Chris Nuñez in my head</b>

13:17.931 --> 13:19.699
<b>just saying the things</b>
<b>that he's saying,</b>

13:19.700 --> 13:22.768
<b>and then I have my own head</b>
<b>trying to be like, "Oh, no,</b>"

13:22.769 --> 13:24.170
<b>you should do it this way,"</b>
<b>and they're fighting.</b>

13:24.171 --> 13:27.306
<b>- How hard is that struggle</b>
<b>between doing what you know</b>

13:27.307 --> 13:28.541
<b>as an artist versus</b>

13:28.542 --> 13:31.210
<b>what you think the judges</b>
<b>are looking for?</b>

13:31.211 --> 13:34.313
<b>- You have to go against</b>
<b>your own instincts a lot,</b>

13:34.314 --> 13:37.650
<b>and then you see that</b>
<b>tripping other people up.</b>

13:37.651 --> 13:39.452
<b>So then you double back</b>
<b>and you're like,</b>

13:39.453 --> 13:41.187
<b>I shouldn't go</b>
<b>against my instincts.</b>

13:41.188 --> 13:43.089
<b>I should trust them all the way.</b>

13:43.090 --> 13:44.924
<b>And then you see</b>
<b>that screwing people up as well</b>

13:44.925 --> 13:49.829
<b>and you're like, oh,</b>
<b>I have no clear plan of attack.</b>

13:49.830 --> 13:53.866
<b>I've had a man say, "I'm not</b>
<b>gonna get tattooed by a bitch."</b>

13:53.867 --> 13:55.234
<b>- Wow.</b>

13:55.235 --> 13:56.669
<b>- I want to beat the [bleep]</b>
<b>out of these boys.</b>

13:56.670 --> 13:58.104
<b> <i>- Girls alliance.</i> </b>

13:58.105 --> 14:01.542
<b>- We have the power to just hunt</b>
<b>like a pack of raptors.</b>

14:03.444 --> 14:07.047
<b> <i>[dramatic music]</i> </b>

14:07.048 --> 14:09.416
<b>- There's a multitude of ways</b>
<b>to play this game.</b>

14:09.417 --> 14:12.953
<b>You seem to play it</b>
<b>very straight up,</b>

14:12.954 --> 14:14.921
<b>and it's all about the tattoos.</b>

14:14.922 --> 14:19.326
<b>Is that a strategy in the sense</b>
<b>of abandoning strategies</b>

14:19.327 --> 14:21.528
<b>and just focusing</b>
<b>in on the artwork</b>

14:21.529 --> 14:23.563
<b>and being a good human being?</b>

14:23.564 --> 14:26.400
<b>- Yeah, I like to think</b>
<b>of myself as a good human being,</b>

14:26.401 --> 14:29.536
<b>but I'm also partially an idiot.</b>

14:29.537 --> 14:32.539
<b>I'm not very good at strategy.</b>

14:32.540 --> 14:36.243
<b>I can draw a cat really well.</b>

14:36.244 --> 14:37.911
<b>So I'll do that,</b>

14:37.912 --> 14:40.313
<b>and that's got to be</b>
<b>my strategy basically,</b>

14:40.314 --> 14:41.982
<b>is just do good work.</b>

14:41.983 --> 14:45.085
<b>- But when it comes</b>
<b>to the girls' alliance,</b>

14:45.086 --> 14:46.887
<b>is that part of your strategy?</b>

14:46.888 --> 14:51.658
<b>- The girls' alliance</b>
<b>wasn't a big master plan</b>

14:51.659 --> 14:53.193
<b>that came together.</b>

14:53.194 --> 14:54.528
<b>The girls' alliance</b>

14:54.529 --> 14:57.898
<b>is just something</b>
<b>that happened organically.</b>

14:57.899 --> 15:01.268
<b>I feel like you guys</b>
<b>are the strongest players.</b>

15:01.269 --> 15:03.170
<b>- Even though</b>
<b>we're on opposite teams,</b>

15:03.171 --> 15:06.473
<b>all of us together are better</b>
<b>than any of those dudes.</b>

15:06.474 --> 15:07.841
<b>- I don't give a damn</b>
<b>about teams</b>

15:07.842 --> 15:09.443
<b>when it comes down to this.</b>

15:09.444 --> 15:12.446
<b>- I think we could definitely</b>
<b>be a force to be reckoned with.</b>

15:12.447 --> 15:13.880
<b>- We're in this industry,</b>

15:13.881 --> 15:16.249
<b>and it's a male-dominated</b>
<b>industry,</b>

15:16.250 --> 15:20.754
<b>and I've had a man</b>
<b>come into a shop,</b>

15:20.755 --> 15:23.790
<b>and look at me,</b>
<b>and throw my portfolio</b>

15:23.791 --> 15:26.626
<b>and say "I'm not gonna</b>
<b>get tattooed by a bitch."</b>

15:26.627 --> 15:28.795
<b>- Wow, really?</b>
<b>- Yeah.</b>

15:28.796 --> 15:31.798
<b>We've all been through</b>
<b>these situations or worse.</b>

15:31.799 --> 15:35.235
<b>Be great to see</b>
<b>a female Ink Master.</b>

15:35.236 --> 15:37.504
<b>So if one of us can get there</b>

15:37.505 --> 15:40.006
<b>then that's kind of a victory</b>
<b>for all of us.</b>

15:40.007 --> 15:42.109
<b>- I want to beat the [bleep]</b>
<b>out of these boys.</b>

15:42.110 --> 15:43.710
<b>- Why the boys?</b> <b>Why not Kelly?</b>

15:43.711 --> 15:45.312
<b>'Cause she's gonna</b>
<b>take your money.</b>

15:45.313 --> 15:47.347
<b>- This is the eighth round</b>
<b>of this competition</b>

15:47.348 --> 15:49.282
<b>and there hasn't been a female</b>
<b>to win this yet.</b>

15:49.283 --> 15:50.717
<b>- Yeah, you don't really know</b>
<b>what it's like.</b>

15:50.718 --> 15:53.220
<b>- Dude, stop playing</b>
<b>the [bleep] vagina card.</b>

15:53.221 --> 15:54.621
<b>- I'm not playing</b>
<b>the vagina card.</b>

15:54.622 --> 15:55.989
<b>- Seriously, ya'll are</b>
<b>pulling the vagina card.</b>

15:55.990 --> 15:57.090
<b>I'm not cool with that.</b>

15:57.091 --> 15:58.225
<b>- Listen...</b>
<b>- Just [bleep] off.</b>

15:58.226 --> 15:59.193
<b>- If ya'll win,</b>
<b>then you know what?</b>

15:59.194 --> 16:00.494
<b>Congratulations.</b>

16:00.495 --> 16:02.829
<b>It doesn't matter</b>
<b>if it's a guy or a girl.</b>

16:02.830 --> 16:04.097
<b>- Listen...</b>
<b>- Man.</b>

16:04.098 --> 16:05.165
<b>- Yeah, well, I pull</b>
<b>the white guy card?</b>

16:05.166 --> 16:06.600
<b>- Captain Privilege.</b>

16:06.601 --> 16:07.834
<b>- You know why</b>
<b>a girl hasn't won?</b>

16:07.835 --> 16:09.469
<b>Because you guys</b>
<b>get too [bleep] emotional.</b>

16:09.470 --> 16:10.871
<b>- Oh, is that what girls do?</b>

16:10.872 --> 16:12.105
<b>- That's all I got</b>
<b>to say about it.</b>

16:12.106 --> 16:14.341
<b>- [bleep] you for thinking</b>
<b>that my emotions</b>

16:14.342 --> 16:16.143
<b>are a detriment.</b>
<b>- Listen to yourself.</b>

16:16.144 --> 16:17.477
<b>You're getting emotional</b>
<b>right now.</b>

16:17.478 --> 16:20.847
<b>- And I have beat you</b>
<b>several times already.</b>

16:20.848 --> 16:22.416
<b>- I'm done with the man thing.</b>

16:22.417 --> 16:24.217
<b>I'm the [bleep] man,</b>
<b>and I'm [bleep] winning.</b>

16:24.218 --> 16:25.719
<b>[bleep].</b>

16:25.720 --> 16:27.421
<b>- Who's emotional now?</b>
<b>- The drama queen in this house</b>

16:27.422 --> 16:30.323
<b>has a blond beard, and</b>
<b>he just stormed out the door.</b>

16:30.324 --> 16:33.293
<b>- Ryan Ashley in the</b>
<b>top six, congratulations.</b>

16:33.294 --> 16:34.429
<b>- Thank you.</b>

16:39.233 --> 16:42.269
<b>I am from northeast</b>
<b>Pennsylvania.</b>

16:42.270 --> 16:45.739
<b> <i>My studio is connected</i> </b>
<b> <i>to my oddities parlor.</i> </b>

16:45.740 --> 16:48.608
<b> <i>This store is, like, my baby.</i> </b>

16:48.609 --> 16:51.111
<b> <i>I am a business woman,</i> </b>
<b> <i>I am an entrepreneur,</i> </b>

16:51.112 --> 16:54.214
<b>I'm an artist,</b>
<b>and my name is on this.</b>

16:54.215 --> 16:55.615
<b>It's not that</b>
<b>I can't do color, it's...</b>

16:55.616 --> 16:56.650
<b>- It's you don't want</b>
<b>to do color.</b>

16:56.651 --> 16:57.818
<b>- I don't like it.</b>

16:57.819 --> 16:59.620
<b>I'm going to win</b>
<b>this competition.</b>

17:01.322 --> 17:03.623
<b>- Oliver, who's gonna be</b>
<b>the first artist</b>

17:03.624 --> 17:05.224
<b>to earn a spot on your team?</b>

17:05.226 --> 17:07.060
<b>- Ryan Ashley.</b>

17:07.060 --> 17:09.029
<b> <i>I picked Ryan first...</i> </b>

17:09.030 --> 17:10.262
<b>- Good going.</b>

17:10.263 --> 17:11.631
<b>- 'Cause she has</b>
<b>great artistic skills,</b>

17:11.632 --> 17:14.233
<b> <i>and she's very good</i> </b>
<b> <i>at what she does.</i> </b>

17:14.234 --> 17:16.837
<b> <i>- I've only been tattooing now</i> </b>
<b> <i>for four years,</i> </b>

17:16.838 --> 17:19.705
<b>which is definitely</b>
<b>not a long time.</b>

17:19.707 --> 17:22.576
<b> <i>My tattoo style</i> </b>
<b> <i>is intricate black and grey.</i> </b>

17:22.577 --> 17:25.645
<b> <i>I love everything</i> </b>
<b> <i>that looks Victorian.</i> </b>

17:25.646 --> 17:27.414
<b>- You've got gentle hands.</b>
<b>Remember that.</b>

17:27.415 --> 17:29.316
<b>- I'm very light handed.</b>

17:29.317 --> 17:33.587
<b>I'm a lady tattooer</b>
<b>and I tattoo like a lady.</b>

17:33.588 --> 17:36.123
<b>- This is probably my most</b>
<b>disappointing tattoo of the day.</b>

17:36.124 --> 17:38.592
<b>All of the inconsistencies</b>
<b>in this line work,</b>

17:38.593 --> 17:40.594
<b> <i>all the unsaturated</i> </b>
<b> <i>areas of color.</i> </b>

17:40.595 --> 17:42.729
<b>- I really mismanaged my time.</b>

17:42.730 --> 17:44.464
<b>- Trying to haul ass</b>
<b>and cut corners</b>

17:44.465 --> 17:47.467
<b>when it's under a microscope,</b>
<b>that [bleep] don't fly here.</b>

17:47.468 --> 17:52.305
<b>- Being in the bottom</b>
<b>has lit a fire under my ass.</b>

17:52.306 --> 17:55.142
<b> <i>I cannot let this happen.</i> </b>

17:55.143 --> 17:57.477
<b>- Oh, my God. It's so good.</b>

17:57.478 --> 17:59.046
<b>- Thank you.</b>

17:59.047 --> 18:00.914
<b>I would do a really cool ram.</b>

18:00.915 --> 18:03.717
<b>What's more powerful than, like,</b>
<b>metal [bleep] chains?</b>

18:03.718 --> 18:06.753
<b>We're going to fight</b>
<b>just as hard or harder</b>

18:06.754 --> 18:09.556
<b> <i>than every single man</i> </b>
<b> <i>in this house.</i> </b>

18:09.557 --> 18:12.459
<b>- What a badass. It's so tight.</b>

18:12.460 --> 18:15.595
<b>- Boys are dumb.</b>
<b>- Boys are so dumb.</b>

18:15.596 --> 18:17.597
<b>- Gian, dummy, he thought</b>

18:17.598 --> 18:19.633
<b>he was throwing us</b>
<b>under the bus.</b>

18:19.634 --> 18:23.103
<b>Gian thought he was giving me</b>
<b>one of the worst canvases,</b>

18:23.104 --> 18:25.038
<b>and I turned</b>
<b>that [bleep] around.</b>

18:25.039 --> 18:26.473
<b> <i>- A lot of people hit</i> </b>
<b> <i>contrast today,</i> </b>

18:26.474 --> 18:28.442
<b>but I really think</b>
<b>you hit it the best.</b>

18:28.443 --> 18:29.743
<b>- I think you have</b>
<b>a lot of good tricks.</b>

18:29.744 --> 18:31.244
<b>Looking strong here.</b>

18:31.245 --> 18:33.213
<b> <i>- Ryan's ability to capture</i> </b>
<b> <i>that face so perfectly</i> </b>

18:33.214 --> 18:34.481
<b> <i>in a one inch portrait,</i> </b>

18:34.482 --> 18:35.949
<b>not many people can do.</b>

18:35.950 --> 18:38.618
<b> <i>- This tattoo has detail</i> </b>
<b> <i>all the way through it.</i> </b>

18:38.619 --> 18:40.420
<b>The wood grain in the hourglass,</b>

18:40.421 --> 18:42.656
<b> <i>the cracks and the weathering</i> </b>
<b> <i>of the skull.</i> </b>

18:42.657 --> 18:44.091
<b>- You're definitely</b>
<b>pushing harder</b>

18:44.092 --> 18:46.159
<b>artistically than</b>
<b>a lot of people in the room.</b>

18:46.160 --> 18:49.129
<b>- The best tattoo of the day</b>
<b>goes to Ryan.</b>

18:49.130 --> 18:50.364
<b>- Thank you.</b>

18:50.365 --> 18:52.933
<b>- The best tattoo</b>
<b>of the day goes to Ryan.</b>

18:52.934 --> 18:56.169
<b>Best tattoo of the day</b>
<b>goes to Ryan.</b>

18:56.170 --> 18:58.138
<b>- I have high hopes</b>
<b>for all of my team members,</b>

18:58.139 --> 18:59.873
<b> <i>but Ryan Ashley</i> </b>
<b> <i>being my first pick,</i> </b>

18:59.874 --> 19:02.577
<b>she has what it takes</b>
<b>to go the distance.</b>

19:04.712 --> 19:09.750
<b>- You were Oliver Peck's</b>
<b>first choice as a team player.</b>

19:09.751 --> 19:11.184
<b>That's got to feel great.</b>

19:11.185 --> 19:14.554
<b>- It feels amazing,</b>
<b>but along with that</b>

19:14.555 --> 19:16.123
<b>there is also pressure</b>

19:16.124 --> 19:18.258
<b>that is put on me</b>
<b>because, you know,</b>

19:18.259 --> 19:20.193
<b>I was like</b>
<b>"Oliver picked me first.</b>

19:20.194 --> 19:22.062
<b>"That means he must</b>
<b>really believe in me,</b>

19:22.063 --> 19:24.798
<b>"so I have to do this for me,</b>
<b>I have to do it for my team,</b>

19:24.799 --> 19:27.567
<b>I have to do it</b>
<b>for Oliver personally."</b>

19:27.568 --> 19:30.003
<b>- And you have what?</b>
<b>Four years of experience?</b>

19:30.004 --> 19:31.204
<b>- Yes.</b>

19:31.205 --> 19:32.906
<b>- How does that feel?</b>
<b>Is that intimidating?</b>

19:32.907 --> 19:36.343
<b>- It makes me feel like</b>
<b>I have that much more to prove,</b>

19:36.344 --> 19:38.111
<b>and something I haven't</b>

19:38.112 --> 19:40.113
<b>discussed very much</b>
<b>of previously.</b>

19:40.114 --> 19:42.282
<b>When I was entering</b>
<b>my apprenticeship,</b>

19:42.283 --> 19:43.717
<b>my mentor showed me</b>

19:43.718 --> 19:45.385
<b>a few different women</b>
<b>in the industry</b>

19:45.386 --> 19:46.987
<b>and he was just like, "You know,</b>"

19:46.988 --> 19:49.856
<b>"you're entering this whole</b>
<b>world that came before you,</b>

19:49.857 --> 19:52.059
<b>"and right now</b>
<b>these are the women</b>

19:52.060 --> 19:54.594
<b>that are doing crazy</b>
<b>amazing things in the industry."</b>

19:54.595 --> 19:57.464
<b>And Kelly was one</b>
<b>of those women that...</b>

19:57.465 --> 19:58.832
<b>- Wow.</b>
<b>- I've been looking up to</b>

19:58.833 --> 20:01.601
<b>since before</b>
<b>I even picked up a machine.</b>

20:01.602 --> 20:03.704
<b>- You're battling it out</b>
<b>with one of your heroes?</b>

20:03.705 --> 20:05.539
<b>- Yeah, luckily for me,</b>
<b>you know,</b>

20:05.540 --> 20:09.876
<b>my strongest competition</b>
<b>are also my closest allies.</b>

20:09.877 --> 20:12.946
<b>So I am definitely</b>
<b>at an advantage.</b>

20:12.947 --> 20:14.281
<b>There's power in numbers,</b>

20:14.282 --> 20:16.116
<b>and this is a hard fight</b>
<b>for one of us,</b>

20:16.117 --> 20:17.718
<b>but if we all stick together...</b>

20:17.719 --> 20:19.886
<b>- I think that we can give</b>
<b>the boys a run for their money.</b>

20:19.887 --> 20:21.321
<b>- They're insecure.</b>

20:21.322 --> 20:24.825
<b>- We must be a threat to them.</b>
<b>- They should be afraid.</b>

20:24.826 --> 20:26.660
<b>- Man, we got to go against</b>
<b>these girls.</b>

20:26.661 --> 20:29.196
<b>They're dangerous.</b>
<b>- They pick one person,</b>

20:29.197 --> 20:30.964
<b>they go after him,</b>
<b>and they're plucking them off.</b>

20:30.965 --> 20:32.566
<b>Anybody that doesn't see</b>
<b>what the [bleep]</b>

20:32.567 --> 20:37.237
<b>is going on is either stupid</b>
<b>or [bleep] blind.</b>

20:37.238 --> 20:38.572
<b>I'm telling you right now,</b>

20:38.573 --> 20:40.006
<b>you got to cut</b>
<b>the head off this [bleep].</b>

20:40.007 --> 20:42.576
<b>You get inside some heads, dude,</b>
<b>that'll [bleep] them up.</b>

20:42.577 --> 20:44.411
<b>- We never went into this</b>
<b>with any intention</b>

20:44.412 --> 20:45.979
<b>of screwing anyone,</b>

20:45.980 --> 20:50.217
<b>or putting a target on</b>
<b>anyone's back or aiming to hunt</b>

20:50.218 --> 20:51.818
<b>like a pack of raptors,</b>

20:51.819 --> 20:53.954
<b>which is what kind of</b>
<b>ended up happening.</b>

20:53.955 --> 20:57.991
<b>- It's not unfathomable to think</b>
<b>about three women in the finale.</b>

20:57.992 --> 21:00.060
<b>- You know, we should be</b>
<b>hunting these boys,</b>

21:00.061 --> 21:02.863
<b>and we need to come at them</b>
<b>from every side.</b>

21:02.864 --> 21:06.133
<b>I mean, as much as I would love</b>
<b>to believe that we had the power</b>

21:06.134 --> 21:08.335
<b>to just hit delete</b>
<b>and get rid of someone...</b>

21:08.336 --> 21:09.836
<b>- It seems like you do, though,</b>

21:09.837 --> 21:11.038
<b>'cause look</b>
<b>at who's still standing.</b>

21:11.039 --> 21:12.372
<b>- Yes.</b>

21:12.373 --> 21:14.141
<b>- It's you, it's Kelly,</b>
<b>and it's Nikki.</b>

21:14.142 --> 21:16.343
<b>Some might argue</b>
<b>that it is working.</b>

21:16.344 --> 21:19.312
<b>- You know, when you put a very</b>
<b>strong group of people together</b>

21:19.313 --> 21:21.848
<b>that all have the same focus,</b>

21:21.849 --> 21:23.917
<b>powerful things can happen.</b>

21:23.918 --> 21:25.552
<b>I know that I'm on Team Peck,</b>

21:25.553 --> 21:28.155
<b>but I'm really rooting</b>
<b>for those girls.</b>

21:28.156 --> 21:31.391
<b>- You got four years</b>
<b>of tattooing experience.</b>

21:31.392 --> 21:33.126
<b>Do you think you can</b>
<b>win this thing?</b>

21:33.127 --> 21:36.563
<b>- I definitely didn't come</b>
<b>to be in second place.</b>

21:36.564 --> 21:37.998
<b>I'm giving it my all,</b>

21:37.999 --> 21:41.334
<b>and I'm hoping</b>
<b>that it'll carry me to the end.</b>

21:41.335 --> 21:43.170
<b>- Let's talk about the fact</b>

21:43.171 --> 21:45.272
<b>that Nate Beavers</b>
<b>openly admitted</b>

21:45.273 --> 21:47.374
<b>to everybody that for a while</b>

21:47.375 --> 21:50.711
<b>he was just kind of riding</b>
<b>the middle doing good enough.</b>

21:50.712 --> 21:53.280
<b>- This is someone's</b>
<b>physical appearance</b>

21:53.281 --> 21:54.748
<b>for the rest of their lives.</b>

21:54.749 --> 21:57.250
<b>Along with that responsibility,</b>

21:57.251 --> 21:59.486
<b>there should be a sense</b>
<b>of pride in yourself</b>

21:59.487 --> 22:01.722
<b>as a tattooer</b>
<b>the same as doctors.</b>

22:01.723 --> 22:03.156
<b>What if you're</b>
<b>in open heart surgery</b>

22:03.157 --> 22:05.192
<b>and your doctor</b>
<b>was like "You know what?</b>"

22:05.193 --> 22:06.960
<b>"Ah, we already got</b>
<b>some good reviews</b>

22:06.961 --> 22:08.695
<b>"for our procedures</b>
<b>this last month.</b>

22:08.696 --> 22:10.297
<b>I'm just gonna stitch</b>
<b>this guy up, yeah."</b>

22:10.298 --> 22:14.034
<b>It's horrible,</b>
<b>and that's on him.</b>

22:14.035 --> 22:16.069
<b>- Was I trying</b>
<b>to do bad tattoos? No I mean...</b>

22:16.070 --> 22:18.205
<b>- You're top six man.</b>
<b>- Yeah, I mean it worked.</b>

22:18.206 --> 22:19.806
<b>I think they're</b>
<b>all scared of me.</b>

22:19.807 --> 22:20.841
<b>- How in the world</b>
<b>would we be scared?</b>

22:20.842 --> 22:22.542
<b>- Plain as day.</b>

22:22.543 --> 22:24.611
<b> <i>- If he refuses to change,</i> </b>
<b> <i>I won't have to go against him.</i> </b>

22:24.612 --> 22:26.692
<b>He's just another person</b>
<b>that's gonna be out of here.</b>

22:27.924 --> 22:30.325
<b> <i>[dramatic music]</i> </b>

22:30.326 --> 22:32.794
<b>- Nate, top six,</b>
<b>congratulations, man.</b>

22:32.795 --> 22:33.795
<b>- Thanks.</b>

22:36.099 --> 22:39.000
<b>I'm from Houston, Texas.</b>
<b>I've been tattooing 24 years.</b>

22:39.001 --> 22:40.435
<b>- Who's gonna be Ink Master?</b>

22:40.436 --> 22:41.938
<b>- Daddy!</b>
<b>- Dada!</b>

22:43.973 --> 22:46.274
<b> <i>- Any time I'm challenged</i> </b>
<b> <i>by a fear,</i> </b>

22:46.275 --> 22:47.943
<b>I just go at it at headfirst.</b>

22:47.944 --> 22:50.645
<b>Hey, are ya'll coming in here</b>
<b>to feed some spiders or what?</b>

22:50.646 --> 22:51.713
<b>- No.</b>
<b>- You want to help?</b>

22:51.714 --> 22:53.415
<b>- Spider?</b>

22:53.416 --> 22:55.751
<b> <i>- I used to have</i> </b>
<b> <i>really bad arachnophobia,</i> </b>

22:55.752 --> 22:59.020
<b> <i>and I went out and bought</i> </b>
<b> <i>a couple of baby tarantulas.</i> </b>

22:59.021 --> 23:01.890
<b>It started with two</b>
<b>and now I got 1,000 of them.</b>

23:01.891 --> 23:04.526
<b>- How am I gonna take care</b>
<b>of all these while you're gone?</b>

23:04.527 --> 23:08.196
<b>- I have no fears and no concern</b>
<b>about not winning.</b>

23:08.197 --> 23:09.398
<b>- You do a lot of conventions?</b>

23:09.399 --> 23:11.533
<b>- I used to do about</b>
<b>21 shows a year.</b>

23:11.534 --> 23:12.868
<b>- How long have you</b>
<b>been tattooing?</b>

23:12.869 --> 23:15.070
<b>- 24 years.</b>
<b>- I'm gonna go with Nate Beaver.</b>

23:15.071 --> 23:17.939
<b> <i>I can't say enough for someone</i> </b>
<b> <i>who's been tattooing 24 years.</i> </b>

23:17.940 --> 23:21.076
<b> <i>- I'm known for being the guy</i> </b>
<b> <i>that does all styles.</i> </b>

23:21.077 --> 23:23.445
<b>- Trying to tell her she's</b>
<b>getting tattooed by a legend.</b>

23:23.446 --> 23:25.414
<b>He's amazing,</b>
<b>he can do anything.</b>

23:25.415 --> 23:26.948
<b> <i>- A head to head tattoo</i> </b>
<b> <i>with Dave,</i> </b>

23:26.949 --> 23:28.283
<b>this is what</b>
<b>I've been hoping for.</b>

23:28.284 --> 23:30.519
<b> <i>I'm gonna send his ass</i> </b>
<b> <i>packing right now.</i> </b>

23:30.520 --> 23:32.554
<b>- I think Nate's gonna kill it.</b>

23:32.555 --> 23:34.122
<b>I think Nate's gonna</b>
<b>kill it, too.</b>

23:34.123 --> 23:35.991
<b> <i>- You look at</i> </b>
<b> <i>the top of the head</i> </b>

23:35.992 --> 23:37.793
<b> <i>and you see those little</i> </b>
<b> <i>negative spaces.</i> </b>

23:37.794 --> 23:39.294
<b> <i>It looks like you</i> </b>
<b> <i>could brush your finger</i> </b>

23:39.295 --> 23:40.762
<b> <i>over the top of that,</i> </b>

23:40.763 --> 23:42.998
<b> <i>and those would individually</i> </b>
<b> <i>move every single time.</i> </b>

23:42.999 --> 23:44.800
<b>That is top notch work.</b>

23:44.801 --> 23:46.301
<b>For you to be able</b>
<b>to come in under pressure</b>

23:46.302 --> 23:48.537
<b>and knock this thing out</b>
<b>of the park like this, I mean,</b>

23:48.538 --> 23:50.972
<b>I couldn't expect you would</b>
<b>ever be in the bottom rung.</b>

23:50.973 --> 23:53.141
<b>- Put me in a Cuban</b>
<b>colored outfit.</b>

23:53.142 --> 23:55.944
<b>- Or, like, just a normal dress</b>
<b>with some frilly stuff or no?</b>

23:55.945 --> 23:57.512
<b>- No.</b>
<b>- Or something like that.</b>

23:57.513 --> 23:59.781
<b>- No.</b>
<b>- I'm screwed.</b>

23:59.782 --> 24:01.483
<b>- I really wanted the hourglass</b>

24:01.484 --> 24:03.919
<b>with the skull,</b>
<b>or a tape measure.</b>

24:03.920 --> 24:06.888
<b>- Afraid the shape of</b>
<b>the boot is gonna look weird.</b>

24:06.889 --> 24:08.090
<b>- That's what I wear every day.</b>

24:08.091 --> 24:09.324
<b>- I could put the boot in there,</b>

24:09.325 --> 24:11.359
<b>but it's not gonna be good</b>
<b>for me.</b>

24:11.360 --> 24:12.794
<b>- Starting with</b>
<b>the apple bottom.</b>

24:12.795 --> 24:17.065
<b>- The guy made a point,</b>
<b>I want this to be a huge ass.</b>

24:17.066 --> 24:19.568
<b> <i>- It looks like two toothpicks</i> </b>
<b> <i>holding that thing up.</i> </b>

24:19.569 --> 24:23.505
<b>- You left yourself open for a</b>
<b>lot of debate on why these lines</b>

24:23.506 --> 24:25.941
<b>are not all clean</b>
<b>or why they don't make sense.</b>

24:25.942 --> 24:28.143
<b>- I guarantee I can show you</b>
<b>clean line work.</b>

24:28.144 --> 24:30.345
<b> <i>- That eyebrow that goes</i> </b>
<b> <i>into your eye,</i> </b>

24:30.346 --> 24:32.013
<b>who has an eyebrow</b>
<b>that goes into your eye?</b>

24:32.014 --> 24:33.615
<b>- I think</b>
<b>they're all scared of me.</b>

24:33.616 --> 24:35.283
<b>- How in the world</b>
<b>would we be scared?</b>

24:35.284 --> 24:36.852
<b>- Plain as day.</b> <b>The only reason</b>

24:36.853 --> 24:38.620
<b>you would want to vote me off</b>
<b>is 'cause you're scared.</b>

24:38.621 --> 24:40.956
<b>- I'm not afraid of you.</b>
<b>I don't think anybody here is.</b>

24:40.957 --> 24:42.724
<b>- Think, like,</b>
<b>why would we be afraid?</b>

24:42.725 --> 24:44.526
<b>- 'Cause I didn't pull out</b>
<b>any big guns.</b>

24:44.527 --> 24:47.028
<b>- What?</b>
<b>- I'm playing the underdog.</b>

24:47.029 --> 24:49.331
<b>That was my strategy,</b>
<b>play it mediocre.</b>

24:49.332 --> 24:52.601
<b>- You're not even trying to</b>
<b>put out your best possible work?</b>

24:52.602 --> 24:53.935
<b>- That's my strategy.</b>

24:53.936 --> 24:55.937
<b>- Man, [bleep] you, bro,</b>
<b>that's bull[bleep].</b>

24:55.938 --> 24:57.372
<b>- I'm playing my game.</b>

24:57.373 --> 24:58.540
<b>- Whatever the [bleep]</b>
<b>you're saying right now</b>

24:58.541 --> 24:59.975
<b>is blowing my mind, dude.</b>

24:59.976 --> 25:01.576
<b>- That's [bleep] up.</b>
<b>- That's his game.</b>

25:01.577 --> 25:04.913
<b>That's his game.</b>
<b>- Oh, it's his game.</b>

25:04.914 --> 25:06.715
<b> <i>- Nate's the one who stumbled</i> </b>
<b> <i>the most</i> </b>

25:06.716 --> 25:08.316
<b> <i>throughout the competition,</i> </b>

25:08.317 --> 25:10.051
<b> <i>but there's no doubt</i> </b>
<b> <i>he's a good tattooer.</i> </b>

25:10.052 --> 25:11.920
<b> <i>There's no doubt</i> </b>
<b> <i>he has the experience</i> </b>

25:11.921 --> 25:14.457
<b>which should make him</b>
<b>an intimidating player.</b>

25:17.894 --> 25:20.495
<b>- So what has been your strategy</b>
<b>coming into this game?</b>

25:20.496 --> 25:23.231
<b>- Early on, I mean, my plan was</b>
<b>to kind of hang back,</b>

25:23.232 --> 25:24.866
<b>see what was happening.</b>

25:24.867 --> 25:27.903
<b>In my heart, I know I can get</b>
<b>to the certain point, you know,</b>

25:27.904 --> 25:30.105
<b>without trying to jump through</b>
<b>a bunch of hoops or anything.</b>

25:30.106 --> 25:32.808
<b>I mean, was I trying</b>
<b>to do bad tattoos? No.</b>

25:32.809 --> 25:35.477
<b>The biggest problem for me</b>
<b>here is just timing them.</b>

25:35.478 --> 25:38.313
<b>Concepts that I have,</b>
<b>I usually do a lot of thinking</b>

25:38.314 --> 25:42.184
<b>before I actually come up</b>
<b>with a rendering for a tattoo.</b>

25:42.185 --> 25:44.753
<b>- Does knowing that</b>
<b>you're gonna be up against</b>

25:44.754 --> 25:47.089
<b>a time limit</b>
<b>play a part of that?</b>

25:47.090 --> 25:48.757
<b>- Yeah, a huge part of it.</b>

25:48.758 --> 25:51.526
<b>For me it's more like I'd rather</b>
<b>get something on there</b>

25:51.527 --> 25:54.362
<b>that I feel is good and solid</b>

25:54.363 --> 25:57.566
<b>in the time limit</b>
<b>then to not finish a piece.</b>

25:57.567 --> 26:00.602
<b>I don't know if that was bad</b>
<b>on my part, but I mean...</b>

26:00.603 --> 26:02.337
<b>- You're top six, man.</b>
<b>- Yeah, I mean, it worked.</b>

26:02.338 --> 26:03.739
<b>- It's working out.</b>

26:03.740 --> 26:06.308
<b>- As long as I can step it up</b>
<b>and keep it going.</b>

26:06.309 --> 26:10.312
<b>- How's that feel being away</b>
<b>from your home for a long time</b>

26:10.313 --> 26:12.414
<b>in a pressure cooker</b>
<b>competition?</b>

26:12.415 --> 26:13.715
<b>- It's mentally taxing.</b>

26:13.716 --> 26:15.183
<b>When you're used</b>
<b>to waking up and, like,</b>

26:15.184 --> 26:17.953
<b>seeing my kids, you know,</b>
<b>"Daddy, Daddy,"</b>

26:17.954 --> 26:19.521
<b>wake up here</b>
<b>and it's like boot camp...</b>

26:19.522 --> 26:22.157
<b>- And your time starts now.</b>
<b>- Yeah, the longer being here</b>

26:22.158 --> 26:25.327
<b>and everything, the more</b>
<b>difficult it is to focus.</b>

26:25.328 --> 26:27.396
<b>A lot of sleepless nights</b>
<b>of just wondering,</b>

26:27.397 --> 26:29.664
<b>like, what the hell's next,</b>
<b>you know?</b>

26:29.665 --> 26:33.068
<b>- You are by far</b>
<b>the most experienced tattooer</b>

26:33.069 --> 26:35.570
<b>in the whole house.</b>
<b>Is that an advantage?</b>

26:35.571 --> 26:37.406
<b>- There's way more factors</b>
<b>involved</b>

26:37.407 --> 26:39.341
<b>than just tattooing anymore.</b>

26:39.342 --> 26:41.309
<b>- Hourglass with a skull in it,</b>

26:41.310 --> 26:44.646
<b>and I want a little family tree,</b>
<b>motor for a motorcycle.</b>

26:44.647 --> 26:47.716
<b>I'm a cabinet installer</b>
<b>so I want some kind of tools.</b>

26:47.717 --> 26:50.786
<b>I want a skull that's got</b>
<b>an American flag on it.</b>

26:50.787 --> 26:52.821
<b>Nate.</b>

26:52.822 --> 26:54.189
<b>- Thanks a lot, guys.</b>

26:54.190 --> 26:55.724
<b>You know, you got this canvas</b>

26:55.725 --> 26:58.360
<b>that's damn near impossible</b>
<b>to do a good tattoo on,</b>

26:58.361 --> 27:00.162
<b>and it puts a added level</b>
<b>of stress.</b>

27:00.163 --> 27:03.899
<b>- In your own shops, you can</b>
<b>refuse to work on anybody.</b>

27:03.900 --> 27:05.500
<b>Here, you're [bleep].</b>

27:05.501 --> 27:07.736
<b>- It's like playing</b>
<b>Russian Roulette and, like,</b>

27:07.737 --> 27:11.807
<b>the girl alliance thing,</b>
<b>that kind of offsets everything.</b>

27:11.808 --> 27:14.643
<b>It's obvious the girls</b>
<b>got favored on this one</b>

27:14.644 --> 27:15.777
<b>and it's such bull[bleep].</b>

27:15.778 --> 27:17.312
<b>- Kevin can play</b>
<b>however he wants,</b>

27:17.313 --> 27:18.547
<b>he won the flash challenge.</b>

27:18.548 --> 27:20.415
<b>- He wants to be tight</b>
<b>with the two top players</b>

27:20.416 --> 27:21.750
<b>so he can last</b>
<b>a little bit longer.</b>

27:21.751 --> 27:22.751
<b>- Wouldn't you do</b>
<b>the same thing?</b>

27:22.752 --> 27:24.352
<b>- No?</b>
<b>- No.</b>

27:24.353 --> 27:27.255
<b>- Is their alliance working?</b>
<b>- I feel like it's working.</b>

27:27.256 --> 27:28.523
<b>I mean, they're</b>
<b>definitely shooting</b>

27:28.524 --> 27:30.292
<b>to have an all-girl finale.</b>

27:30.293 --> 27:31.793
<b>- But what's interesting is that</b>

27:31.794 --> 27:33.962
<b>they're eventually gonna have</b>
<b>to fight against each other.</b>

27:33.963 --> 27:35.764
<b>There can only be one winner.</b>

27:35.765 --> 27:37.899
<b>- They'll worry about that when</b>
<b>they're the last ones standing,</b>

27:37.900 --> 27:39.701
<b>I'm sure.</b>

27:39.702 --> 27:41.369
<b> <i>- If you're gonna be</i> </b>
<b> <i>a dick to me,</i> </b>

27:41.370 --> 27:42.637
<b>you're my first priority</b>

27:42.638 --> 27:44.573
<b>to get you the hell</b>
<b>out of this house.</b>

27:44.574 --> 27:46.975
<b>Why the [bleep] would you be</b>
<b>in this competition, Boneface?</b>

27:46.976 --> 27:49.111
<b>- Why do you look 50</b>
<b>and you're 24?</b>

27:49.112 --> 27:51.279
<b>- That mother [bleep]</b>
<b>should not be tattooing anybody.</b>

27:51.280 --> 27:54.483
<b>I don't think Boneface should be</b>
<b>in this competition at all.</b>

27:54.484 --> 27:56.724
<b>- You went after people 'cause</b>
<b>you just didn't like them.</b>

27:58.330 --> 28:01.265
<b> <i>[dramatic music]</i> </b>

28:01.266 --> 28:04.102
<b>- Nikki Simpson, top six,</b>
<b>congratulations.</b>

28:04.103 --> 28:06.337
<b>- I'm just lucky</b>
<b>that I'm still here.</b>

28:06.338 --> 28:07.505
<b>- Do you really think</b>
<b>it was luck?</b>

28:07.506 --> 28:09.907
<b>Because people do view you</b>
<b>as a threat</b>

28:09.908 --> 28:12.344
<b>both artistically</b>
<b>and personally.</b>

28:17.249 --> 28:19.417
<b>- I grew up in Tucson, Arizona.</b>

28:19.418 --> 28:21.018
<b> <i>I've always been in love</i> </b>
<b> <i>with tattooing,</i> </b>

28:21.019 --> 28:23.754
<b>and when I got started,</b>
<b>I was 19 so all my friends</b>

28:23.755 --> 28:25.289
<b> <i>were running off, [bleep] around</i> </b>

28:25.290 --> 28:27.625
<b> <i>and my head was completely 100%</i> </b>

28:27.626 --> 28:30.895
<b> <i>focused on being the best.</i> </b>

28:30.896 --> 28:32.797
<b>My biggest fear is how</b>

28:32.798 --> 28:34.766
<b>I'm gonna get along</b>
<b>with everybody because...</b>

28:34.767 --> 28:36.968
<b>- Yeah, that's gonna be</b>
<b>a problem. You're contentious.</b>

28:36.969 --> 28:38.836
<b>- I don't want to handle</b>
<b>anybody [bleep] with me</b>

28:38.837 --> 28:40.338
<b>while I'm there to try and win,</b>

28:40.339 --> 28:42.774
<b>but when you're put</b>
<b>in crazy situations like that,</b>

28:42.775 --> 28:44.175
<b>I don't know</b>
<b>how I'm gonna react.</b>

28:44.176 --> 28:45.877
<b>- You're gonna own that.</b>
<b>You're pretty badass</b>

28:45.878 --> 28:47.445
<b>and you're pretty much</b>
<b>the most competent person</b>

28:47.446 --> 28:49.247
<b>I know, so you'll be okay.</b>

28:49.248 --> 28:51.949
<b>- Tattooing isn't the obstacle</b>
<b>for me in this.</b>

28:51.950 --> 28:53.818
<b> <i>Being around people</i> </b>
<b> <i>that I don't know,</i> </b>

28:53.819 --> 28:55.186
<b>I don't know</b>
<b>if I'm gonna hate them,</b>

28:55.187 --> 28:56.821
<b>I don't know if they're</b>
<b>gonna be mean or...</b>

28:56.822 --> 28:58.055
<b>- It's gonna be tough,</b>

28:58.056 --> 28:59.957
<b>and you're gonna be</b>
<b>in tight quarters.</b>

28:59.958 --> 29:01.659
<b>You're gonna have to form bonds</b>

29:01.660 --> 29:03.528
<b>or else you won't make it,</b>
<b>you won't survive.</b>

29:03.529 --> 29:05.696
<b>- You have to walk into a place</b>
<b>like you're the best thing</b>

29:05.697 --> 29:07.665
<b>that ever happened to them,</b>
<b>you understand that?</b>

29:07.666 --> 29:09.001
<b>That's the way you have to be.</b>

29:10.669 --> 29:12.370
<b>- Ms. Nikki Simpson.</b>

29:12.371 --> 29:14.205
<b>- Whoo, I got it.</b>

29:14.206 --> 29:17.141
<b>I got my Team Nuñez,</b>
<b>I knew I would. Badass.</b>

29:17.142 --> 29:19.811
<b>- Nikki's really good.</b>
<b> <i>- She's really good.</i> </b>

29:19.812 --> 29:21.579
<b> <i>- I know how to tattoo better</i> </b>

29:21.580 --> 29:23.514
<b>than most of the people</b>
<b>in this group.</b>

29:23.515 --> 29:25.016
<b> <i>I'm a threat.</i> </b>

29:25.017 --> 29:27.084
<b>- Taking you down.</b>
<b>- Then come at me, Sirvone!</b>

29:27.085 --> 29:28.586
<b>- I'ma come at you guns blazing.</b>

29:28.587 --> 29:31.556
<b>- Go for it, bro.</b>
<b>[bleep] nothing's happening.</b>

29:31.557 --> 29:33.524
<b>Ugh, it's hot. I'm gonna die.</b>

29:33.525 --> 29:35.426
<b>- You're not gonna die.</b>
<b>- [bleep] burned my [bleep].</b>

29:35.427 --> 29:37.028
<b>- What's your plan?</b>
<b>Wait a minute. Wait a minute.</b>

29:37.029 --> 29:40.098
<b>- I have no goddamn plan</b>
<b>except not [bleep] die.</b>

29:40.099 --> 29:42.333
<b> <i>Just because I've only been</i> </b>
<b> <i>doing this for five years</i> </b>

29:42.334 --> 29:46.037
<b> <i>doesn't mean that I am not</i> </b>
<b> <i>skilled enough to be here.</i> </b>

29:46.038 --> 29:47.139
<b>I'm pretty [bleep] great.</b>

29:48.474 --> 29:50.775
<b>- I love this tattoo.</b>
<b>The face is beautiful,</b>

29:50.776 --> 29:52.743
<b> <i>the composition is really great.</i> </b>

29:52.744 --> 29:53.945
<b>- Nikki, you killed it.</b>

29:53.946 --> 29:55.346
<b> <i>You create a lot of cool</i> </b>
<b> <i>textures</i> </b>

29:55.347 --> 29:56.914
<b> <i>and depths</i> </b>
<b> <i>with your color tones.</i> </b>

29:56.915 --> 29:58.649
<b> <i>You get some super</i> </b>
<b> <i>smooth technique.</i> </b>

29:58.650 --> 29:59.951
<b> <i>- It has a really strong look.</i> </b>

29:59.952 --> 30:01.285
<b>I think you did</b>
<b>a great job here.</b>

30:01.286 --> 30:03.454
<b>- Thank you.</b>
<b>- The judges have decided</b>

30:03.455 --> 30:06.524
<b>that the winner of today's</b>
<b>flash challenge is Nikki.</b>

30:06.525 --> 30:08.226
<b> <i>- Sweet, thank you.</i> </b>

30:08.227 --> 30:11.963
<b>- The winner of today's</b>
<b>flash challenge is Nikki.</b>

30:11.964 --> 30:16.334
<b>The judges have decided the best</b>
<b>tattoo of the day goes to Nikki.</b>

30:16.335 --> 30:18.236
<b>- That's awesome,</b>
<b>didn't expect that.</b>

30:18.237 --> 30:20.905
<b>- The best tattoo of</b>
<b>the day goes to Nikki.</b>

30:20.906 --> 30:23.074
<b>- Sweet, thank you.</b>

30:23.075 --> 30:25.143
<b>- Nikki is</b>
<b>the ultimate gamesman here.</b>

30:25.144 --> 30:27.378
<b> <i>She stirred the pot,</i> </b>
<b> <i>caused a lot of trouble,</i> </b>

30:27.379 --> 30:29.013
<b> <i>ran her mouth,</i> </b>
<b> <i>pissed everybody off,</i> </b>

30:29.014 --> 30:30.414
<b> <i>made them uncomfortable,</i> </b>

30:30.415 --> 30:32.450
<b>and then kind of paved</b>
<b>the way for herself</b>

30:32.451 --> 30:34.485
<b>just to be a bully</b>
<b>and not get [bleep] with.</b>

30:34.486 --> 30:36.420
<b> <i>And now she's kind</i> </b>
<b> <i>of calling her own shots.</i> </b>

30:36.421 --> 30:38.390
<b>She's probably gonna be</b>
<b>top three for sure.</b>

30:41.493 --> 30:44.195
<b>- There seems to be a little bit</b>
<b>of a tendency</b>

30:44.196 --> 30:45.563
<b>to kind of pick at people</b>

30:45.564 --> 30:47.965
<b>and rub them the wrong way,</b>
<b>and not back down.</b>

30:47.966 --> 30:50.535
<b>- Well, I don't try</b>
<b>to pick at people.</b>

30:50.536 --> 30:52.103
<b>When they [bleep] with me</b>

30:52.104 --> 30:54.138
<b>I'm going to stand up</b>
<b>for myself, and that's it.</b>

30:54.139 --> 30:55.773
<b>I've sacrificed</b>
<b>a lot to be here.</b>

30:55.774 --> 30:59.210
<b>Why am I going to let them</b>
<b>completely take this game</b>

30:59.211 --> 31:01.813
<b>in whatever direction they want</b>
<b>at my expense?</b>

31:01.814 --> 31:03.214
<b>I won't lie, I definitely</b>

31:03.215 --> 31:05.683
<b>have gotten pretty far</b>
<b>based on my alliance.</b>

31:05.684 --> 31:09.053
<b>- But to use the alliance</b>
<b>to just pick out a personality</b>

31:09.054 --> 31:12.557
<b>and just send them packing</b>
<b>with such dead accuracy?</b>

31:12.558 --> 31:14.692
<b>- Our friendships are not</b>
<b>just going to be us</b>

31:14.693 --> 31:16.894
<b>brushing each other's hair</b>
<b>in the girl's room.</b>

31:16.895 --> 31:19.664
<b>It's gonna be let's make sure</b>
<b>that these boys</b>

31:19.665 --> 31:21.666
<b>don't play any games</b>
<b>to get us out of here.</b>

31:21.667 --> 31:23.801
<b>- Now, you guys actually went</b>
<b>after players</b>

31:23.802 --> 31:25.269
<b>'cause you just</b>
<b>didn't like them.</b>

31:25.270 --> 31:26.971
<b>- If you're gonna be</b>
<b>a dick to me,</b>

31:26.972 --> 31:28.706
<b>you're my first priority</b>

31:28.707 --> 31:30.708
<b>to get you the hell</b>
<b>out of this house.</b>

31:30.709 --> 31:33.778
<b>- Don't jump on mine as if it's</b>
<b>the worst thing in the world.</b>

31:33.779 --> 31:35.079
<b>He was happy with it. I'm fine.</b>

31:35.080 --> 31:36.481
<b>- It's not about</b>
<b>what they're happy with,</b>

31:36.482 --> 31:37.949
<b>it's about what the judges</b>
<b>are happy with.</b>

31:37.950 --> 31:39.417
<b>- Listen, dude,</b>
<b>I'm done with it.</b>

31:39.418 --> 31:41.018
<b>- Dude, you've been done.</b>
<b>- I'm still here.</b>

31:41.019 --> 31:42.420
<b>- For what?</b>
<b>- We'll see.</b>

31:42.421 --> 31:44.155
<b>- Why? Because you just want</b>
<b>to be a [bleep] asshole?</b>

31:44.156 --> 31:45.323
<b>- You're right.</b>

31:45.324 --> 31:46.691
<b>- Then why the [bleep]</b>
<b>would you be</b>

31:46.692 --> 31:47.925
<b>in this competition, Boneface?</b>
<b>You don't...</b>

31:47.926 --> 31:49.460
<b>- Why do you look 50</b>
<b>and you're 24?</b>

31:49.461 --> 31:50.995
<b>- Go [bleep] yourself</b>

31:50.996 --> 31:52.697
<b>you [bleep] piece of [bleep].</b>

31:52.698 --> 31:54.966
<b>That mother[bleep]</b>
<b>should not be tattooing anybody</b>

31:54.967 --> 31:56.501
<b>if he continues</b>
<b>to tattoo like that.</b>

31:56.502 --> 31:58.636
<b>- Hang on a sec, Nikki.</b>
<b>- Let other people talk, Nikki.</b>

31:58.637 --> 32:00.404
<b>Shut the [bleep] up</b>
<b>and let people talk.</b>

32:00.405 --> 32:04.041
<b>- I don't think Boneface should</b>
<b>be in this competition at all.</b>

32:04.042 --> 32:07.211
<b>- People are using critiques</b>
<b>to hide behind personal issues.</b>

32:07.212 --> 32:09.514
<b>- Yours was worse than theirs.</b>
<b>- That's your opinion.</b>

32:09.515 --> 32:12.817
<b>Everybody else voted for her,</b>
<b>so obviously it wasn't.</b>

32:12.818 --> 32:15.686
<b>- When it comes down to it,</b>
<b>just don't cross Nikki Simpson,</b>

32:15.687 --> 32:17.722
<b>you're gonna be okay.</b>

32:17.723 --> 32:19.490
<b>If you had to compare Team Nuñez</b>

32:19.491 --> 32:23.060
<b>versus the girls' alliance,</b>
<b>who's gonna win?</b>

32:23.061 --> 32:25.696
<b>- Team Nuñez never sat together</b>
<b>and decided</b>

32:25.697 --> 32:29.734
<b>that it doesn't matter who wins</b>
<b>as long as one of us does.</b>

32:29.735 --> 32:30.935
<b>- Right.</b>
<b>- Yeah, we have to work together</b>

32:30.936 --> 32:32.670
<b>as a team, but in the end</b>

32:32.671 --> 32:35.873
<b>it's every man for himself</b>
<b>and it's bloodthirsty.</b>

32:35.874 --> 32:37.675
<b>The girls are not like that.</b>

32:37.676 --> 32:40.278
<b>- You have to admit</b>
<b>that it's pretty remarkable</b>

32:40.279 --> 32:43.881
<b>that both you and Ryan basically</b>
<b>got started doing this</b>

32:43.882 --> 32:45.249
<b>about as long</b>
<b>as this competition</b>

32:45.250 --> 32:47.585
<b>has been around.</b> <b>- Wow.</b>

32:47.586 --> 32:48.686
<b>- So when we were</b>
<b>doing season one...</b>

32:48.687 --> 32:50.421
<b>- I didn't know that.</b>

32:50.422 --> 32:52.223
<b>- You weren't even</b>
<b>a tattooer yet.</b>

32:52.224 --> 32:53.724
<b>- It's not about how long</b>
<b>you've been doing it,</b>

32:53.725 --> 32:55.693
<b>it's about what you do</b>
<b>with that time.</b>

32:55.694 --> 32:59.230
<b>I came into tattooing</b>
<b>at more of a beneficial time</b>

32:59.231 --> 33:04.001
<b>than anybody else when [bleep]</b>
<b>has been crazy for tattooers.</b>

33:04.002 --> 33:06.838
<b>It's on a platform</b>
<b>like never before.</b>

33:06.839 --> 33:10.741
<b>I can see the different types</b>
<b>of art out there on social media</b>

33:10.742 --> 33:14.312
<b>and that has been a source</b>
<b>of inspiration for me</b>

33:14.313 --> 33:16.647
<b>and these old timers</b>
<b>never had that.</b>

33:16.648 --> 33:18.316
<b>- You knocked out people</b>

33:18.317 --> 33:20.284
<b>who have been</b>
<b>doing this for 20 years.</b>

33:20.285 --> 33:22.019
<b>- I don't want to leave</b>
<b>"Ink Master" feeling</b>

33:22.020 --> 33:24.355
<b>like I was the smartest kid</b>
<b>in kindergarten.</b>

33:24.356 --> 33:25.890
<b>I want to leave here knowing</b>

33:25.891 --> 33:29.460
<b>that I did better</b>
<b>than people that I look up to.</b>

33:29.461 --> 33:32.196
<b>- Let's talk about another</b>
<b>of the remaining six,</b>

33:32.197 --> 33:35.900
<b>Kevin LaRoy, who never seems</b>
<b>to want to listen</b>

33:35.901 --> 33:38.136
<b>to your team leader Chris Nuñez.</b>

33:38.137 --> 33:40.872
<b>- Kevin is great at what</b>
<b>he does with his style</b>

33:40.873 --> 33:42.673
<b>and that's a particular style,</b>

33:42.674 --> 33:45.676
<b>and I think he has failed</b>
<b>to understand</b>

33:45.677 --> 33:49.347
<b>that this is not</b>
<b>necessarily Portfolio Master.</b>

33:49.348 --> 33:52.116
<b>This is "Ink Master"</b>
<b>where if you want to get far,</b>

33:52.117 --> 33:56.287
<b>you have to do things</b>
<b>that show your versatility.</b>

33:56.288 --> 33:59.423
<b>If he refuses to change</b>
<b>what he's going to do,</b>

33:59.424 --> 34:02.460
<b>that's fine with me because</b>
<b>I won't have to go against him.</b>

34:02.461 --> 34:04.862
<b>He's just another person</b>
<b>that's gonna be out of here.</b>

34:04.863 --> 34:06.998
<b>- You've had some friction</b>
<b>with one of the judges.</b>

34:06.999 --> 34:08.199
<b>- Outlining here is always</b>
<b>gonna win.</b>

34:08.199 --> 34:09.367
<b>- But wait...</b>

34:09.368 --> 34:10.835
<b>- It's a fact.</b>
<b>- Whose fact?</b>

34:10.835 --> 34:12.235
<b>- It's a fact when it comes</b>
<b>to this competition.</b>

34:12.237 --> 34:14.077
<b>- We can sit here</b>
<b>and be stubborn all day long.</b>

34:15.775 --> 34:18.713
<b> <i>[dramatic music]</i> </b>

34:20.648 --> 34:22.415
<b>- Kevin LaRoy, top six.</b>

34:22.416 --> 34:24.885
<b>Did you ever think</b>
<b>that you would come in here,</b>

34:24.886 --> 34:27.286
<b>and compete,</b>
<b>and make it this far?</b>

34:27.288 --> 34:29.089
<b>- I knew I would somewhat,</b>
<b>you know,</b>

34:29.090 --> 34:31.225
<b>do well</b>
<b>but I'm just as surprised.</b>

34:34.661 --> 34:37.664
<b> <i>I just recently moved to L.A.</i> </b>
<b> <i>for opportunities.</i> </b>

34:37.665 --> 34:39.399
<b>- This is the one</b>
<b>that you need right here.</b>

34:39.400 --> 34:41.768
<b>- Going to school for fashion</b>
<b>definitely let me know</b>

34:41.768 --> 34:44.103
<b>that once you learn</b>
<b>the rules you can break them,</b>

34:44.105 --> 34:45.672
<b>and I'm all about</b>
<b>breaking rules.</b>

34:45.672 --> 34:48.275
<b>[inaudible] wear this,</b>
<b>like, literally this.</b>

34:48.275 --> 34:50.342
<b>- Yeah.</b>
<b>- People may hate me for it,</b>

34:50.344 --> 34:53.280
<b>but tattooing is like</b>
<b>I'm the director</b>

34:53.281 --> 34:55.681
<b>and I can choose</b>
<b>where I want to do things.</b>

34:55.683 --> 34:57.016
<b>- This is, like,</b>
<b>almost gonna open the door</b>

34:57.018 --> 34:58.485
<b>for you to have your own shop.</b>

34:58.486 --> 34:59.986
<b>- Especially if I do well</b>
<b>in the competition it'll be...</b>

34:59.987 --> 35:01.988
<b>- Yeah, it's literally...</b>
<b>- A definitely good look, yeah.</b>

35:01.989 --> 35:03.423
<b>- Don't come home without that.</b>

35:03.424 --> 35:04.791
<b>[laughter]</b>

35:04.792 --> 35:06.526
<b>- I like competition,</b>

35:06.527 --> 35:07.828
<b>and the bigger the better.</b>

35:07.829 --> 35:10.297
<b>So, I mean, I'm ready for it.</b>

35:10.298 --> 35:11.698
<b>- The point is for us</b>
<b>to guide you,</b>

35:11.699 --> 35:13.099
<b>to push you</b>
<b>in the right direction.</b>

35:13.100 --> 35:15.268
<b>We've sat through seven seasons</b>

35:15.269 --> 35:17.170
<b>of watching people</b>
<b>make mistakes going, "Damn,</b>"

35:17.171 --> 35:18.705
<b>I wish we could've told them."</b>

35:18.706 --> 35:20.866
<b>Well, this is the time</b>
<b>where I'm gonna get to tell you.</b>

35:21.576 --> 35:23.710
<b>- Kevin LaRoy.</b>

35:23.711 --> 35:24.978
<b> <i>- I'm a realism artist.</i> </b>

35:24.979 --> 35:26.346
<b> <i>I've been tattooing</i> </b>
<b> <i>for 10 years.</i> </b>

35:26.347 --> 35:28.448
<b> <i>A lot of it unconventionally,</i> </b>

35:28.449 --> 35:32.152
<b> <i>but I feel like I'm open</i> </b>
<b> <i>to all sorts of challenges.</i> </b>

35:32.153 --> 35:33.520
<b>- Don't underestimate Kevin.</b>

35:33.521 --> 35:35.288
<b>- He always goes out of bounds.</b>

35:35.289 --> 35:36.723
<b>He always breaks the rules.</b>

35:36.724 --> 35:40.060
<b>- Kevin, just put the [bleep]</b>
<b>outline in there.</b>

35:40.061 --> 35:41.728
<b>- I didn't do [bleep].</b>

35:41.729 --> 35:43.730
<b>I'm like, I'm gonna do</b>
<b>what the [bleep] I want to do.</b>

35:43.731 --> 35:45.398
<b> <i>- I would think that these</i> </b>
<b> <i>artists are starting</i> </b>

35:45.399 --> 35:47.734
<b>to get wind of doing</b>
<b>what the judges say,</b>

35:47.735 --> 35:49.903
<b>but then you got Kevin.</b>

35:49.904 --> 35:52.739
<b> <i>Kevin refuses</i> </b>
<b> <i>to outline each week.</i> </b>

35:52.740 --> 35:55.208
<b>- I'd say, Kevin, even if</b>
<b>we don't vote for you, man,</b>

35:55.209 --> 35:57.077
<b>probably going down there, bro.</b>

35:57.078 --> 35:58.445
<b>- We already know</b>
<b>what they're gonna hit on,</b>

35:58.446 --> 36:00.080
<b>on this one</b>
<b>is that there's no line work.</b>

36:00.081 --> 36:02.749
<b>- The start of an outline</b>
<b>and then the non-follow through</b>

36:02.750 --> 36:05.519
<b>of an outline throws me</b>
<b>completely with your style.</b>

36:05.520 --> 36:08.588
<b>- It looks great in the photo</b>
<b>now, but in one or two years</b>

36:08.589 --> 36:10.056
<b> <i>all those reds</i> </b>
<b> <i>are gonna bleed together</i> </b>

36:10.057 --> 36:12.759
<b> <i>and all that detail</i> </b>
<b> <i>is gonna go away.</i> </b>

36:12.760 --> 36:14.561
<b> <i>- Your tattoo</i> </b>
<b> <i>just looks unfinished.</i> </b>

36:14.562 --> 36:16.029
<b>You look at everybody</b>
<b>else's tattoos</b>

36:16.030 --> 36:17.864
<b>and tell me how you're competing</b>
<b>against them today.</b>

36:17.865 --> 36:19.699
<b>'Cause the outlining here</b>
<b>is always gonna win.</b>

36:19.700 --> 36:22.536
<b>- Who are you to say who is</b>
<b>supposed to go home before who?</b>

36:22.537 --> 36:24.871
<b>- You can't be mad at me</b>
<b>for having an opinion.</b>

36:24.872 --> 36:26.273
<b>- I don't give a damn.</b>

36:26.274 --> 36:27.841
<b>Don't try to blame me</b>
<b>down there and say</b>

36:27.842 --> 36:29.442
<b>he's a better tattooer than me.</b>
<b>That's not the case.</b>

36:29.443 --> 36:30.710
<b>- I meant in</b>
<b>the damn competition...</b>

36:30.711 --> 36:32.279
<b>- In the competition, in life.</b>

36:32.280 --> 36:33.914
<b>The times I've been</b>
<b>at the bottom, it hasn't been</b>

36:33.915 --> 36:35.549
<b>because I [bleep] the bed.</b>

36:35.550 --> 36:37.918
<b>Nobody's ever voted my tattoo</b>
<b>as the worst of the day, never.</b>

36:37.919 --> 36:41.221
<b>- Kevin LaRoy is a nice guy</b>
<b>that does his own [bleep].</b>

36:41.222 --> 36:43.890
<b> <i>Kevin tells me,</i> </b> <b> <i>"Yes, yes, yes."</i> </b>

36:43.891 --> 36:45.859
<b>And then does no, no, no.</b>

36:45.860 --> 36:47.460
<b>Eric is a better</b>
<b>tattooer than you.</b>

36:47.461 --> 36:49.229
<b>- But today... but wait, today.</b>

36:49.230 --> 36:50.797
<b>- Can't be hurt,</b>
<b>it's a fact, he...</b>

36:50.798 --> 36:52.532
<b>- Whose fact?</b>
<b>'Cause it's not mine.</b>

36:52.533 --> 36:54.568
<b>- It's a fact when</b>
<b>it comes to this competition.</b>

36:54.569 --> 36:56.136
<b>He can finish a thing.</b>
<b>He can outline, he can shade.</b>

36:56.137 --> 36:57.337
<b>- Well, if that was a fact</b>
<b>then you wouldn't have done</b>

36:57.338 --> 36:59.072
<b>a worse tattoo than me today.</b>

36:59.073 --> 37:00.340
<b>I'm on your team</b>
<b>and you're not even...</b>

37:00.341 --> 37:01.875
<b>but that's neither</b>
<b>here nor there.</b>

37:01.876 --> 37:03.743
<b>- It's not about that</b>
<b>because at the end of the day</b>

37:03.744 --> 37:04.878
<b>there is no teams.</b>

37:04.879 --> 37:06.747
<b>- Well, it says</b>
<b>Nuñez on... at my station.</b>

37:09.116 --> 37:11.451
<b>- What's it been like</b>
<b>to be on a team</b>

37:11.452 --> 37:13.954
<b>where you have a little friction</b>
<b>with the team leader?</b>

37:13.955 --> 37:15.121
<b>- It's one of those things</b>
<b>where it's like</b>

37:15.122 --> 37:16.356
<b>you have your stubborn opinions</b>

37:16.357 --> 37:17.524
<b>and I have mine.</b> <b>- Yeah.</b>

37:17.525 --> 37:18.892
<b>- And you're no different</b>
<b>than me.</b>

37:18.893 --> 37:20.327
<b>We can sit here</b>
<b>and be stubborn all day long.</b>

37:20.328 --> 37:21.862
<b>I see things one way,</b>
<b>you see things another way.</b>

37:21.863 --> 37:24.831
<b>And I'm not about to conform</b>
<b>to the way you see things.</b>

37:24.832 --> 37:27.534
<b>- You took a lot of heat</b>
<b>about the line work issues.</b>

37:27.535 --> 37:29.202
<b> <i>- Why again no outlines today?</i> </b>

37:29.203 --> 37:32.072
<b>- I'm a realism artist and to</b>
<b>put lines in something realistic</b>

37:32.073 --> 37:33.073
<b>doesn't make sense to me.</b>

37:33.074 --> 37:34.541
<b>- If you had the same outline</b>

37:34.542 --> 37:35.876
<b>on this whole tattoo</b>
<b>then you'd be sitting up there</b>

37:35.877 --> 37:37.511
<b>and somebody else</b>
<b>would be down here.</b>

37:37.512 --> 37:39.780
<b>- I'm not paying mind to this.</b>
<b>I don't give a [bleep].</b>

37:41.716 --> 37:44.184
<b>Chris and Ollie is always,</b>
<b>"You do all or nothing."</b>

37:44.185 --> 37:46.553
<b>You don't just line</b>
<b>some of the tattoo.</b>

37:46.554 --> 37:48.321
<b>You're making it too much</b>
<b>of a requirement</b>

37:48.322 --> 37:49.723
<b>and I don't think</b>
<b>I want to do it.</b>

37:49.724 --> 37:51.725
<b>You're gonna judge it harshly</b>
<b>then do so.</b>

37:51.726 --> 37:54.828
<b>- When you guys have to go in</b>
<b>and get critiques,</b>

37:54.829 --> 37:56.163
<b>what are those days</b>
<b>like for you?</b>

37:56.164 --> 37:59.132
<b>- It's almost like</b>
<b>if you have a baby,</b>

37:59.133 --> 38:00.834
<b>and to you, this baby</b>
<b>is beautiful.</b>

38:00.835 --> 38:02.736
<b>It's like the prettiest baby</b>
<b>in the world,</b>

38:02.737 --> 38:05.639
<b>but now you have three people</b>
<b>telling you</b>

38:05.640 --> 38:07.340
<b>everything wrong with your baby,</b>

38:07.341 --> 38:09.209
<b>and you have to sit here</b>
<b>and listen to it.</b>

38:09.210 --> 38:11.311
<b>- Do you ever turn around</b>
<b>and walk back to the line</b>

38:11.312 --> 38:13.947
<b>and go, "Man, my baby</b>
<b>is [bleep] ugly."</b>

38:13.948 --> 38:15.482
<b>- That's the first thing</b>
<b>you think,</b>

38:15.483 --> 38:17.551
<b>like "[bleep] my baby is ugly.</b>"

38:17.552 --> 38:20.887
<b>Like, damn, like,</b>
<b>what's wrong with my genes?"</b>

38:20.888 --> 38:22.789
<b>- What has been</b>
<b>the biggest surprise</b>

38:22.790 --> 38:24.558
<b>being an "Ink Master" viewer</b>

38:24.559 --> 38:26.526
<b>and then now being</b>
<b>an "Ink Master" competitor?</b>

38:26.527 --> 38:28.995
<b>- Honestly,</b>
<b>it's the authenticity,</b>

38:28.996 --> 38:30.397
<b>because I felt like</b>
<b>a lot of things</b>

38:30.398 --> 38:31.765
<b>may have been scripted</b>
<b>on this show...</b>

38:31.766 --> 38:33.300
<b>just watching I'm like,</b>
<b>there's no way</b>

38:33.301 --> 38:34.734
<b>that you're really crying.</b>

38:34.735 --> 38:35.902
<b>There's no way you really</b>
<b>feel that way right now,</b>

38:35.903 --> 38:37.404
<b>you know, but yeah.</b>

38:37.405 --> 38:40.106
<b>Coming here, I can completely</b>
<b>understand how a good artist</b>

38:40.107 --> 38:42.008
<b>could [bleep] up</b>
<b>in this competition.</b>

38:42.009 --> 38:43.276
<b>You know, rightfully so,</b>
<b>it's like,</b>

38:43.277 --> 38:44.878
<b>it's a lot of factors</b>
<b>that carry on,</b>

38:44.879 --> 38:46.246
<b>a lot of variables</b>
<b>that attribute</b>

38:46.247 --> 38:48.548
<b>to a [bleep]-up tattoo,</b>
<b>not just your talent.</b>

38:48.549 --> 38:50.450
<b>- A lot of people have claimed</b>
<b>that there's a girls' alliance.</b>

38:50.451 --> 38:52.719
<b>- Mm-hmm.</b>
<b>- How does that affect the game?</b>

38:52.720 --> 38:54.087
<b>- I think it's beautiful.</b>

38:54.088 --> 38:56.022
<b>I think it is a beautiful thing.</b>
<b>I think it is great.</b>

38:56.023 --> 38:57.491
<b>I'm all about a underdog story,</b>

38:57.492 --> 39:00.494
<b>and I feel like as a female</b>
<b>in this industry,</b>

39:00.495 --> 39:02.028
<b>you absolutely should</b>
<b>form together</b>

39:02.029 --> 39:03.563
<b>and blow every single one</b>
<b>of these mother[bleep]</b>

39:03.564 --> 39:04.865
<b>out the water.</b>

39:04.866 --> 39:07.100
<b>- Have you experienced</b>
<b>any prejudice in that area?</b>

39:07.101 --> 39:09.336
<b>- Everyone who I work with,</b>
<b>they see me.</b>

39:09.337 --> 39:11.738
<b>It's sad that people's</b>
<b>first impressions</b>

39:11.739 --> 39:13.874
<b>are usually based off</b>
<b>what they think of women,</b>

39:13.875 --> 39:15.775
<b>or think of gay people, or think</b>
<b>of black people, you know?</b>

39:15.776 --> 39:17.677
<b>- Sure.</b>
<b>- But that's where you have</b>

39:17.678 --> 39:19.379
<b>to take your responsibility</b>

39:19.380 --> 39:21.047
<b>and produce good work</b>

39:21.048 --> 39:22.315
<b>where they can't say</b>
<b>anything about it.</b>

39:22.316 --> 39:23.517
<b>- Well, it's an</b>
<b>interesting testament</b>

39:23.518 --> 39:25.152
<b>to you as an artist</b>
<b>that, you know,</b>

39:25.153 --> 39:27.053
<b>you've had some friction</b>
<b>with one of the judges,</b>

39:27.054 --> 39:28.221
<b>you didn't give him</b>

39:28.222 --> 39:30.357
<b>what he wanted</b>
<b>every time he asked for it,</b>

39:30.358 --> 39:32.025
<b>and you stayed true</b>
<b>to what you do and...</b>

39:32.026 --> 39:35.495
<b>- And I'm sitting here top six.</b>
<b>- And you're here, top six.</b>

39:35.496 --> 39:37.330
<b>- I stood my ground,</b>
<b>probably went to the bottom</b>

39:37.331 --> 39:40.400
<b>more than anybody this season,</b>
<b>but not for a bad tattoo.</b>

39:40.401 --> 39:43.570
<b>- But that is a testament</b>
<b>to sticking to your guns, man.</b>

39:43.571 --> 39:45.238
<b>- Right on, you know,</b>
<b>that's tight.</b>

39:45.239 --> 39:46.873
<b>I mean, I'm grateful I'm here.</b>

39:46.874 --> 39:49.042
<b>- You go ahead</b>
<b>and do that no line again.</b>

39:49.043 --> 39:51.077
<b>- I may not do that next time.</b>

39:51.078 --> 39:53.480
<b>- The report card's</b>
<b>not mattering so much.</b>

39:53.481 --> 39:55.315
<b>You can still turn this thing</b>
<b>around and win it.</b>

39:55.316 --> 39:56.950
<b>- I'm confident in that fact.</b>
<b>I feel like everybody</b>

39:56.951 --> 39:59.219
<b>has an equal opportunity</b>
<b>to prove themselves.</b>

39:59.220 --> 40:01.188
<b>It's just making</b>
<b>smart decisions.</b>

40:01.189 --> 40:04.291
<b>- It's exciting that this is</b>
<b>the last six of us,</b>

40:04.292 --> 40:06.493
<b>but I'm a little nervous now.</b>

40:06.494 --> 40:07.861
<b>- Yeah.</b>

40:07.862 --> 40:09.782
<b>- I feel like the [bleep]</b>
<b>is just about to begin.</b>

40:14.168 --> 40:16.970
<b> <i>announcer: On the next episode</b>

40:18.406 --> 40:20.674
<b> <i>- We just have to send one</i> </b>
<b> <i>of those boys home,</i> </b>

40:27.415 --> 40:29.416
