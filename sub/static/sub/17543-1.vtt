01:20.840 --> 01:22.126
Bring him here.

01:25.320 --> 01:26.685
In the time of our ancestors

01:26.880 --> 01:30.487
the cycle of our people lay in the
hands of the children.

01:31.120 --> 01:34.647
A child's position in the tribe
was left to the maker.

01:35.160 --> 01:39.848
Children bearing marks were brought
before the elders.

01:40.000 --> 01:41.843
There, they were given titles...

01:42.200 --> 01:45.170
...titles that would last a lifetime.

01:49.040 --> 01:51.088
Wisdom...

01:53.560 --> 01:55.847
courage...

01:58.720 --> 02:00.529
vision.

02:04.720 --> 02:08.088
This boy holds the holy marks

02:08.560 --> 02:11.166
of our ancestors.

02:12.600 --> 02:15.046
He is a leader.

02:17.000 --> 02:19.002
He is a prophet.

02:20.680 --> 02:22.842
We should listen to him.

02:23.560 --> 02:26.882
We should listen to him.

03:00.680 --> 03:02.489
I see you!

03:18.280 --> 03:19.725
Nat?

03:21.920 --> 03:23.729
Nat!

03:24.080 --> 03:26.606
All right, you win again.

03:27.080 --> 03:29.082
Come on out!

03:38.520 --> 03:42.081
Sam? You come on in here for supper!

03:42.320 --> 03:43.924
Yessum.

03:44.160 --> 03:45.491
Bye, Nat.

03:45.640 --> 03:46.971
Bye.

05:37.360 --> 05:38.680
You so much as bat an eye,

05:38.760 --> 05:41.206
I'm gonna blow you from here to Hell.

05:41.440 --> 05:42.930
What you doin' out here, boy?

05:43.560 --> 05:46.000
Pickin' up some food for my master,

05:46.080 --> 05:47.445
Benjamin Turner.

05:47.640 --> 05:50.405
In the middle of the night? Turn around.

05:55.080 --> 05:57.447
Where your pass at?

05:59.080 --> 06:02.084
Bring it on. C'mon! Bring it!

06:03.520 --> 06:05.602
Get back.

06:07.440 --> 06:09.442
You think you're smarter
than me, don't you, boy?

06:10.160 --> 06:11.685
No, sir.

06:11.880 --> 06:13.160
Jesse, who do we call a nigger

06:13.240 --> 06:15.686
who done think
he can outsmart a white man?

06:15.880 --> 06:17.530
A dead nigger.

06:17.680 --> 06:19.284
Turn around.

06:22.360 --> 06:24.249
On your knees.

06:28.280 --> 06:30.442
You done this to yourself, boy.

06:49.000 --> 06:50.001
What happened?

06:50.120 --> 06:51.120
Go on to bed.

06:51.200 --> 06:52.929
I got caught stealing food.

06:53.120 --> 06:56.647
I killed a slave catcher. I gotta go.

06:57.720 --> 07:00.326
You take care of your mom
and nana, you hear?

07:00.440 --> 07:01.601
You a child of God.

07:01.800 --> 07:04.531
You got purpose. It's in you.

07:04.720 --> 07:06.440
The Lord put it there,

07:06.520 --> 07:09.285
and there ain't nothing nobody
can do to take it away.

07:09.480 --> 07:10.606
You hear?

07:10.760 --> 07:11.921
Yes, sir.

07:12.160 --> 07:14.731
Now you go ahead on and go to bed.

07:15.520 --> 07:18.444
I'll be back for y'all as soon as I can.

07:27.320 --> 07:30.529
Go on back to bed.
Go on to bed, girl! We sleep!

07:47.760 --> 07:51.367
Bridget! Nancy! Y'all wake up!

07:52.200 --> 07:53.520
Isaac's in a lot of trouble.

07:53.600 --> 07:56.968
I need one of y'all
to tell me where he is.

07:57.200 --> 07:59.806
Don't know where he is, massa.
We ain't seen him all night.

08:00.040 --> 08:01.040
You sure?

08:01.120 --> 08:04.010
Ben, I'm gonna ask you to leave.

08:04.200 --> 08:05.200
Huh?

08:05.280 --> 08:07.601
A white man has lost his life tonight.

08:07.840 --> 08:10.207
You know like I do what that mean. Get!

08:10.400 --> 08:12.280
Now, any harm done to these people,

08:12.360 --> 08:14.089
I'm gonna call the sheriff! I'm serious!

08:19.640 --> 08:22.007
None of y'all know where he is, huh?

08:22.200 --> 08:24.202
No, sir.

08:27.600 --> 08:29.170
Goddamnit.

08:33.240 --> 08:34.240
What about you, boy?

08:34.320 --> 08:35.481
He don't know nothing, either.

08:49.600 --> 08:51.011
Where's your daddy at?

08:54.400 --> 08:57.847
Now listen, you don't tell me
where he's at...

08:58.040 --> 08:59.640
someone else is gonna find him,

08:59.720 --> 09:01.370
and they gonna kill him.

09:02.920 --> 09:07.209
You tell me, I'll go get him.
I'll bring him back here safe.

09:07.320 --> 09:08.367
All right?

09:10.840 --> 09:13.320
Tell me where daddy's at.

09:15.280 --> 09:18.887
Say it. Spit something
outta that mouth! Say it!

09:20.440 --> 09:21.930
Tell me where he's at!

09:24.640 --> 09:27.007
Goddamnit.

09:28.880 --> 09:31.690
You that nigger's boy, all right.

09:31.920 --> 09:33.888
If I find out y'all's been lying...

09:34.800 --> 09:38.122
I'm gonna come back here,
I ain't gonna be so nice...

09:38.320 --> 09:41.164
Oh, massa, please! Please!
Massa, please! Oh, Lord!

09:41.360 --> 09:43.200
All right, that's... That's enough! Stop!

09:45.080 --> 09:47.082
You best teach that boy some manners.

09:47.280 --> 09:48.760
Next time he look me in the eye,

09:48.840 --> 09:52.083
you gonna get the same thing
what waitin' for his pa.

10:11.480 --> 10:13.926
Mind if I help you?

10:14.680 --> 10:16.489
No, ma'am.

10:16.720 --> 10:18.480
Samuel told me something this morning

10:18.560 --> 10:20.050
I wanted to ask you about.

10:21.480 --> 10:25.690
He said... Nat knows how to read.

10:26.520 --> 10:28.040
Nat don't not know how to read.

10:28.120 --> 10:31.124
Part of me couldn't believe it myself.

10:31.720 --> 10:33.927
So I tested him.

10:35.520 --> 10:37.329
Sure enough...

10:37.520 --> 10:40.922
there he was sounding out letters.

10:42.160 --> 10:44.686
You have him come by the house
tomorrow after lunch.

10:44.880 --> 10:46.640
He don't mean no harm.

10:46.720 --> 10:48.722
I'ma whip him good
the next time I see him.

10:48.960 --> 10:52.521
Whip him? Nonsense.

10:53.520 --> 10:55.966
I'm gonna teach him.

10:56.520 --> 10:59.967
If the good Lord gave that boy
a gift to read...

11:00.160 --> 11:02.731
we'd be remiss to let it go to waste.

11:03.960 --> 11:06.327
And don't expect him back anytime soon.

11:06.560 --> 11:08.961
He'll be living with us
in the main house for a while.

11:09.160 --> 11:12.767
Lessons best not be disturbed
in the beginning.

11:12.960 --> 11:14.769
Yes, ma'am.

11:34.400 --> 11:37.563
It's okay, baby. It's okay. It ain't real.

11:37.800 --> 11:41.566
It ain't real. It's all right.
It's in your mind.

11:41.800 --> 11:43.723
It's in your mind.

11:43.920 --> 11:46.207
Momma's here now.

11:49.000 --> 11:51.207
Want my poppa.

11:53.000 --> 11:55.002
Me too, baby.

11:56.440 --> 11:58.442
Me too.

12:00.680 --> 12:02.603
Put your arms through.

12:06.240 --> 12:08.242
How handsome.

12:22.440 --> 12:24.841
He'll be all right.

12:54.880 --> 12:57.929
These books are for white folks.

12:58.720 --> 13:02.361
They're full of things
your kind wouldn't understand.

13:03.200 --> 13:06.124
But I do have a special one just for you.

13:06.360 --> 13:08.200
And guess what?

13:08.280 --> 13:10.248
It's the best book ever written.

13:16.760 --> 13:19.809
You're a special boy, Nathaniel.

13:22.760 --> 13:25.570
Study hard and heed my instructions, hear?

13:25.760 --> 13:27.922
Your life...

13:28.160 --> 13:30.731
it'll never be the same.

13:30.920 --> 13:32.285
I'll see to that.

13:32.440 --> 13:33.805
Yes, missus.

13:38.960 --> 13:41.964
"Genesis. In the beginning..."

13:42.160 --> 13:44.162
In the beginning...

13:44.400 --> 13:46.562
Here, this word here, "The."

13:46.800 --> 13:49.849
That's tricky. Now, these letters "T-H."

13:50.080 --> 13:51.360
Whenever you see them...

13:51.440 --> 13:54.410
"...cleanse your hands, ye sinners...

13:54.600 --> 13:58.446
"and purify your hearts, ye double-minded.

13:58.600 --> 14:02.321
"Be afflicted, and mourn, and weep.

14:02.520 --> 14:06.161
"Let your laughter
be turned to mourning...

14:06.440 --> 14:09.808
"and your joy to heaviness."

14:10.000 --> 14:14.767
James 4, Chapter 8 and 9.

14:29.440 --> 14:32.967
Turn with me, if you would, to James 1.

14:33.160 --> 14:37.722
Holding on to the goodness of the Lord.

14:43.120 --> 14:44.080
I spoke to Ben

14:44.160 --> 14:45.969
before he went on to be with the Lord.

14:49.040 --> 14:53.489
He felt you'd be more useful
to our family as a field hand.

14:59.640 --> 15:01.642
I'm sorry, Nat.

15:20.520 --> 15:22.160
Now, you gonna start here,

15:22.240 --> 15:24.527
and you're gonna work your way
down yonder.

15:24.680 --> 15:26.682
And I'll be right over here. You hear?

15:41.360 --> 15:42.361
Ah!

16:32.320 --> 16:34.322
Thank you, brother.

16:42.080 --> 16:46.768
I had fainted, unless I had
believed to see...

16:46.960 --> 16:49.122
the goodness of the Lord...

16:49.360 --> 16:52.091
in the land of the living.

16:53.760 --> 16:56.764
Wait on the Lord...

16:56.960 --> 16:58.644
be of good courage,

16:58.760 --> 17:01.366
and He shall strengthen thine heart.

17:03.440 --> 17:06.364
Wait, I say...

17:06.599 --> 17:08.602
on the Lord.

17:11.839 --> 17:13.604
Let us bow our heads.

17:20.000 --> 17:22.367
Sam, that sister of yours...

17:22.640 --> 17:24.961
gonna make a fine wife indeed.

17:26.359 --> 17:27.720
It's been a true blessing

17:27.800 --> 17:31.805
seeing her develop
into the woman that she is.

17:32.000 --> 17:33.320
It'd be an even better blessing

17:33.400 --> 17:34.480
seein' her and Momma...

17:34.560 --> 17:37.800
put their feet under his table
instead of mine.

17:49.200 --> 17:51.646
I gotta say...

17:51.840 --> 17:55.208
Sam, your slaves sure do know
how to behave.

17:55.400 --> 17:57.846
I'm impressed with them
every time I come around.

17:58.240 --> 18:00.402
Well, they God fearin'.
One of them's a preacher.

18:00.680 --> 18:01.760
No one's gotta tell you

18:01.840 --> 18:04.207
the times are tough with the drought.

18:04.400 --> 18:07.688
It's gettin' harder for
the whites in this county...

18:07.880 --> 18:10.451
to clothe and feed their niggers good.

18:10.680 --> 18:14.844
Talks of insurrection got folks scared.

18:16.240 --> 18:18.640
I think people might pay good money

18:18.720 --> 18:21.007
to have them calm down a bit.

18:21.240 --> 18:23.846
Especially by one of their own.

18:33.240 --> 18:35.891
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

18:37.440 --> 18:39.522
You seen a nigger run past here?

18:40.440 --> 18:43.250
Naw. Then again I doze off for a few.

18:43.440 --> 18:44.720
What about you, boy?

18:44.800 --> 18:48.725
Best not lie now.
I know when y'all's lyin'.

18:48.880 --> 18:51.042
No, sir.

18:51.240 --> 18:53.880
Couple of niggers went missin'
off Bill Johnson's place this mornin'.

18:54.080 --> 18:57.483
Say they raised up on an overseer
before they took off.

18:59.240 --> 19:00.880
All right, you see somethin' let us know.

19:00.960 --> 19:02.246
Will do.

19:02.400 --> 19:03.561
Giddyup.

19:11.680 --> 19:13.840
You finish up here,
I'll go square up inside.

19:13.920 --> 19:15.410
Yes, sir.

19:24.720 --> 19:29.851
Ma'am. The youngin',
he dropped this a step back.

19:30.720 --> 19:32.529
Thank ya.

19:36.920 --> 19:38.640
Whatcha think you're doin'?

19:38.720 --> 19:39.720
He was just tryin'...

19:39.800 --> 19:41.450
You spoke to my wife.

19:42.680 --> 19:44.409
Where's your owner, boy?

19:45.440 --> 19:47.090
I asked you a question.

19:52.560 --> 19:55.530
You best goin' to put that stick down now!

19:55.720 --> 19:58.690
I want the Sheriff. This boy assaulted me!

19:58.800 --> 20:00.131
He assaulted my wife!

20:00.360 --> 20:01.441
And I'm bringin' charges!

20:01.560 --> 20:02.607
Sheriff Floyd?

20:02.720 --> 20:04.404
All right, you fetch him if you like.

20:04.640 --> 20:07.769
But in the meantime I will give you to the
count of three to put your stick down...

20:07.960 --> 20:10.246
before I give you some real charges
to give him when he gets here.

20:10.440 --> 20:11.646
You threatnin' me?

20:11.800 --> 20:12.961
One.

20:13.960 --> 20:15.769
Two.

20:16.760 --> 20:19.127
C'mon, get the boy.

20:19.320 --> 20:21.129
Let's get home.

20:39.720 --> 20:40.801
We got sweet corn!

20:41.000 --> 20:42.240
C'mon now! Get your grits!

20:42.320 --> 20:43.560
We got sweet corn here.

20:43.800 --> 20:45.848
Here you go.

20:46.000 --> 20:47.760
And this one here!

20:47.840 --> 20:49.490
Strong as an ox!

20:49.600 --> 20:51.682
Nothin' but good seed flowin'
from this here buck.

20:51.920 --> 20:55.322
Look at them teeth. Huh?
I'll start him out at...

20:55.600 --> 20:57.364
200.

20:58.160 --> 20:59.366
150?

20:59.600 --> 21:01.807
C'mon now, I gotta
make a living here, gents.

21:02.000 --> 21:04.606
100? 75?

21:05.200 --> 21:07.202
Sold! Get outta here.

21:07.360 --> 21:09.806
Put a yoke on him. Bring her up here.

21:11.440 --> 21:16.048
Now, consider this comely wench.

21:18.200 --> 21:20.280
Not a day over 18.

21:20.360 --> 21:22.886
All right, I'll start her off at 175.

21:23.360 --> 21:26.204
I got 175. Do I hear two?

21:26.760 --> 21:30.207
Now we're talkin'! Do I got 225?

21:30.360 --> 21:33.211
Massa, that wench there sure would make
a good weddin' gift for Miss Catherine.

21:33.360 --> 21:34.480
225!

21:34.560 --> 21:35.721
You keep sayin' she been askin'.

21:35.880 --> 21:37.040
Do I hear 250?

21:37.120 --> 21:38.690
She looks right young, if you ask me.

21:38.880 --> 21:39.881
C'mon now.

21:40.000 --> 21:41.490
- You right, sir, she young.
- Gimme 250.

21:41.680 --> 21:44.126
- C'mon.
- But with the right teacher,

21:44.240 --> 21:45.241
a wench like that?

21:45.400 --> 21:46.481
250.

21:46.640 --> 21:47.641
Could be workin' a long time.

21:47.840 --> 21:50.241
There it is! 275?

21:50.480 --> 21:52.084
Massa, sure would be a shame to watch her

21:52.200 --> 21:54.407
go to waste for such a low price.

21:54.640 --> 21:58.406
And what the hell would you know about
what's a little and what's a lot, huh?

21:58.640 --> 22:00.640
I don't know
what's gotten into you lately,

22:00.720 --> 22:02.085
but whatever it is, you better quit.

22:02.320 --> 22:04.402
Are you seein' what I'm seein'?

22:04.640 --> 22:09.771
You take this one home,
you know, clean her up...

22:09.920 --> 22:12.400
won't be long before you find yourself

22:12.480 --> 22:14.608
happier than a dog with three balls!

22:15.880 --> 22:17.245
Smile, bitch.

22:17.440 --> 22:20.250
That's 250 goin' once.

22:21.200 --> 22:24.443
250 goin' twice.

22:24.640 --> 22:26.722
275.

22:26.920 --> 22:29.446
We got 275!

22:29.640 --> 22:32.007
275 goin' once.

22:32.240 --> 22:35.687
275 goin' twice.

22:36.600 --> 22:40.685
Sold to that fine gentleman in the back!

22:44.920 --> 22:46.922
Whoa.

22:49.720 --> 22:51.927
She be fine, sir.

22:52.120 --> 22:54.122
I sure hope you're right.

22:55.440 --> 22:57.040
Have your momma get her cleaned and fed.

22:57.120 --> 22:58.120
Start breakin' her in.

22:58.200 --> 22:59.200
Yes, sir.

22:59.280 --> 23:00.880
You and Hark can start on the north fence

23:00.960 --> 23:03.281
- first thing in the morning.
- Yes, sir.

23:09.320 --> 23:10.720
I ain't gonna hurt you.

23:10.800 --> 23:13.326
Just gonna climb up and help you out.

23:17.920 --> 23:19.968
It's all right.

23:44.520 --> 23:46.080
Who is this child? What happened?

23:46.160 --> 23:47.491
Burnin' up.

23:47.960 --> 23:51.442
This mine! This my dress!
My dress! This my dress!

23:51.640 --> 23:52.687
Go now! Get out, ya!

23:54.200 --> 23:56.965
We're not gonna hurt you.
We're not gonna hurt you.

23:57.120 --> 23:58.201
Don't take it away.

24:31.560 --> 24:33.680
You just smile

24:33.760 --> 24:35.560
and let them do the talkin'. All right?

24:35.640 --> 24:37.404
Yessum.

24:44.800 --> 24:48.202
Afternoon, massa. This here Cherry-Ann.

24:48.400 --> 24:49.526
Massa.

24:50.400 --> 24:51.845
Catherine!

24:53.920 --> 24:56.400
Catherine, this here is Cherry-Ann.

24:56.560 --> 24:57.766
Missus.

25:01.040 --> 25:02.405
Oh, thank you!

25:04.200 --> 25:06.851
Come on, I want you to meet Momma.

25:11.040 --> 25:12.849
Momma.

25:14.040 --> 25:15.280
Thank you.

25:15.440 --> 25:16.601
For what?

25:17.600 --> 25:21.685
For gettin' her better.
For makin' her so beautiful.

25:21.880 --> 25:24.087
I didn't do nothin'.

25:24.280 --> 25:26.040
That girl was brought into this world

25:26.120 --> 25:28.088
as beautiful as she could be.

25:37.880 --> 25:40.884
It sure is sad to see you
and the missus go.

25:41.080 --> 25:42.640
We'll be just down the road.

25:42.720 --> 25:45.086
When we get all good and settled,
we'll come back and visit.

25:45.280 --> 25:47.248
On Sundays for church and that.

25:47.480 --> 25:49.040
Well, there's no rush.

25:49.120 --> 25:50.201
Oh.

25:50.400 --> 25:51.481
I'm foolin'. Come here.

25:51.640 --> 25:56.089
If y'all need anything, or he ain't
treatin' you right, you let me know.

25:56.320 --> 25:58.049
Yes, big brother. I love you.

25:58.240 --> 25:59.960
Love you, too.

26:00.040 --> 26:01.644
Momma, you ready?

26:06.560 --> 26:08.720
I'm worried about you, Sam.

26:08.800 --> 26:11.485
This a big place to be
out here all by yourself.

26:11.640 --> 26:13.642
I'll be fine.

26:18.680 --> 26:20.489
You take care now.

26:20.680 --> 26:22.489
- All right.
- Hmm.

26:28.680 --> 26:31.923
Massa. For the horses.

26:32.920 --> 26:34.285
Just one.

26:34.440 --> 26:35.680
Yes, sir.

26:41.920 --> 26:43.490
Hi.

26:44.360 --> 26:45.691
Hi.

26:48.520 --> 26:49.851
I'm Nat.

26:50.040 --> 26:51.451
I know.

26:52.960 --> 26:55.167
Sorry for...

26:55.960 --> 26:57.724
fightin' you.

26:57.880 --> 27:00.121
Oh, that's fine.

27:02.800 --> 27:03.847
Um...

27:12.400 --> 27:14.482
They're pretty.

27:15.160 --> 27:18.050
Found them 'round here.

27:18.320 --> 27:20.209
Thank you.

27:30.880 --> 27:32.211
Bye.

27:59.000 --> 28:00.923
You got a right, you got a right

28:01.080 --> 28:03.208
You got a right, you got a right

28:03.400 --> 28:05.243
You got a right to the Tree of Life

28:05.440 --> 28:07.442
You got a right to the Tree of Life

28:07.600 --> 28:09.568
You got a right, you got a right

28:09.760 --> 28:11.444
You got a right, you got a right

28:11.600 --> 28:13.602
You gotta right to the Tree of Life

28:13.760 --> 28:15.728
You gotta right to the Tree of Life

28:15.960 --> 28:19.806
- Hold on!
- Hold on!

28:19.960 --> 28:20.961
Hold on!

28:21.120 --> 28:22.080
Hold on!

28:22.160 --> 28:23.160
Hold on!

28:23.240 --> 28:24.200
Hold on!

28:24.280 --> 28:26.282
- Hold on!
- Hold on!

28:26.440 --> 28:30.650
Okay, hold on! Oh, yeah, hold on!

28:35.320 --> 28:36.960
Just as the planted crop

28:37.040 --> 28:38.644
is harvested in its own time...

28:38.880 --> 28:41.884
so too has the Lord planted us.

28:50.080 --> 28:51.161
Good Lord.

28:53.480 --> 28:55.801
The good Lord, the good Lord...

28:56.080 --> 28:59.640
will finish His work in us.

29:05.680 --> 29:09.082
So, in closing, I urge you all
to take heart...

29:09.280 --> 29:11.009
for God is at work in your life,

29:11.120 --> 29:13.771
and He will not stop until
his job is done. Amen?

29:13.960 --> 29:15.485
- Amen.
- Dismissed!

29:21.840 --> 29:23.280
It seems like it's been forever

29:23.360 --> 29:25.328
since I last seen you.

29:26.320 --> 29:28.687
There were a few miles between us.

29:29.520 --> 29:32.126
Just feels like so many more.

29:33.680 --> 29:35.523
How is it there?

29:36.120 --> 29:40.842
It's fine. Not like what
I come from 'fore here.

29:41.040 --> 29:44.200
Most days I'm just tending
to Miss Elizabeth

29:44.280 --> 29:46.886
or fetching this-that for Miss Catherine.

29:50.320 --> 29:53.324
You know if y'all coming back
next week for church?

29:53.560 --> 29:55.369
I know as much as you.

29:55.480 --> 29:57.528
I suppose if missus is suggesting it...

29:57.720 --> 30:00.121
Master Reese don't mind the trip.

30:02.360 --> 30:05.170
I sure wouldn't wanna wait
another season to see ya.

30:06.120 --> 30:08.168
Me, neither.

30:21.560 --> 30:24.166
My nana got it from my grandaddy.

30:24.920 --> 30:28.049
She brought it with her when
she was taken from Africa.

30:29.360 --> 30:32.409
Said it was the only thing
that kept her mind free.

30:33.760 --> 30:35.762
It's pretty.

30:40.760 --> 30:42.569
I want you to have it.

30:45.600 --> 30:49.400
In case I don't see you
for a while, you...

30:50.400 --> 30:52.926
have something that reminds you of me.

30:57.960 --> 31:00.611
I don't know if it's right I take it.

31:00.760 --> 31:03.440
'Sides, I don't have nothing to give you

31:03.520 --> 31:05.409
to remind you of me.

31:07.600 --> 31:10.809
I spend all my time
thinkin' about you already.

31:13.760 --> 31:14.807
Cherry?

31:14.920 --> 31:16.729
Come help with Momma. It's time to go.

32:30.640 --> 32:32.244
Who there?

32:40.440 --> 32:42.249
Nat?

32:46.960 --> 32:48.689
What are you doin'?

32:58.160 --> 33:00.288
I shoulda done that earlier.

33:02.680 --> 33:04.409
You came here to kiss me?

33:11.120 --> 33:13.487
No, no, no.

33:16.280 --> 33:18.681
I ain't got much.

33:19.120 --> 33:23.091
My faith, Momma, Nana.

33:23.280 --> 33:26.284
Up until now, enough.

33:28.280 --> 33:30.851
Cherry, I'd feel right honored
if you'd be my wife.

33:31.720 --> 33:36.328
I'd treat ya right.
Protect ya with my life.

33:36.520 --> 33:38.329
If you'd have me.

33:40.520 --> 33:43.444
Yes. Yes, I will.

33:58.320 --> 34:00.320
What now?

34:00.400 --> 34:01.401
Uh...

34:01.760 --> 34:03.922
I talk it over with Samuel.

34:04.120 --> 34:06.930
Get us a cabin set up when y'all visit.

34:07.640 --> 34:09.768
All right.

34:27.760 --> 34:30.570
Heavenly Father.
We are gathered here today...

34:30.760 --> 34:32.880
to join together these two children,

34:32.960 --> 34:36.168
who have found the love
that exists in You.

34:36.360 --> 34:39.762
The love that surrounds
all of us all the time.

34:39.960 --> 34:43.601
We bless these children
together with our hands...

34:43.800 --> 34:46.963
that the love that flows
through our hands...

35:13.000 --> 35:14.809
Well, hello, Reverend.

35:15.000 --> 35:16.560
I wasn't expecting to see you around

35:16.640 --> 35:17.801
these parts 'till Sunday.

35:18.000 --> 35:19.570
What brings you around
the middle of the week?

35:19.840 --> 35:21.760
Never a wrong time...

35:21.840 --> 35:24.081
to bring a blessing
to a brother in Christ.

35:24.280 --> 35:25.441
Oh, Lord.

35:25.560 --> 35:27.210
Is this blessing gonna cost me money?

35:27.400 --> 35:31.200
Not a penny. To the contrary, in fact.

35:31.440 --> 35:33.568
Isaiah, run us out a water.

35:33.760 --> 35:36.001
Gin, if you please.

35:36.240 --> 35:39.050
So, I put the word out
about your preacher.

35:42.360 --> 35:46.126
Got a couple of farmers
willing to turn a good coin.

35:46.320 --> 35:47.924
- Is that right?
- Mmm-hmm.

35:48.160 --> 35:51.369
Every bit counts these days.

35:52.240 --> 35:53.241
Oh.

35:59.080 --> 36:00.650
Ah!

36:01.400 --> 36:02.401
Mmm.

36:03.440 --> 36:05.522
If your boy does to their liking,

36:05.640 --> 36:06.971
you could get outta debt.

36:07.160 --> 36:09.162
Save your farm.

36:12.000 --> 36:14.606
And all I gotta do is let Nat preach.

36:14.720 --> 36:16.520
That's it.

36:16.600 --> 36:20.400
Now, I'm not vouching for
the character of these fellas.

36:20.560 --> 36:23.564
What business they runnin' or how.

36:23.760 --> 36:24.760
I'm just here to tell you

36:24.840 --> 36:26.444
that there's an opportunity there.

36:26.640 --> 36:29.371
One you got the means to capitalize on.

36:29.480 --> 36:30.527
Whereabouts we talkin'?

36:30.800 --> 36:32.643
In Southampton, at the start.

36:34.280 --> 36:35.611
Well, sounds good enough.

36:35.760 --> 36:37.125
I'll send you the details.

36:37.280 --> 36:41.444
Names, locations, and dates,
I'd say by tomorrow.

36:41.600 --> 36:43.284
You already booked the dates.

36:43.440 --> 36:45.090
I figured you'd say yes.

36:45.960 --> 36:47.769
What's in it for you?

36:47.960 --> 36:51.965
The pure joy of knowing
that I'm helping a brother.

36:52.240 --> 36:53.241
And, uh...

36:53.360 --> 36:54.361
Oh, here it comes.

36:54.600 --> 36:58.366
Well, if I was to receive
a gift offering...

36:59.320 --> 37:00.845
I certainly wouldn't object.

37:01.520 --> 37:03.124
You are caution, Reverend.

37:04.520 --> 37:06.966
I am but a servant.

37:15.520 --> 37:17.488
Here's some salt pork and some tomatoes

37:17.600 --> 37:18.761
for when you get hungry.

37:19.000 --> 37:21.002
Thank you, Momma.

37:22.520 --> 37:24.522
Don't y'all go getting' worried now.

37:24.800 --> 37:26.290
I'll be back directly.

37:26.440 --> 37:28.010
I know.

37:28.160 --> 37:31.562
Pray the Lord brings you back safe.

38:11.680 --> 38:13.205
You Massa Turner's nigger?

38:13.360 --> 38:15.044
I'm Nat.

38:15.920 --> 38:18.048
Massa Turner's in here.

38:23.200 --> 38:24.929
Come on.

38:32.080 --> 38:33.684
- We're here?
- Yes, sir.

38:38.240 --> 38:40.242
Sam Turner.

38:40.360 --> 38:43.125
Made it right on time. Joseph Randall.

38:44.200 --> 38:48.125
This here's Abner.
This little one? Jasper.

38:48.880 --> 38:50.882
- This the preacher?
- Yes, sir.

38:51.080 --> 38:52.445
Nat?

38:52.640 --> 38:54.085
Evening, sir.

38:54.640 --> 38:56.160
He's a little young, ain't he?

38:56.240 --> 38:57.651
Why, he's old enough.

38:57.880 --> 38:59.484
You've been studying
the Word awhile, haven't you?

39:01.440 --> 39:02.680
Studyin'?

39:02.760 --> 39:06.287
I can barely train my niggers
to learn their own names.

39:06.440 --> 39:08.283
Come on!

39:15.440 --> 39:16.560
It's hard times

39:16.640 --> 39:18.608
for small farmers like you and myself.

39:18.800 --> 39:19.881
Breakin' even's hard enough,

39:20.000 --> 39:21.650
but getting ahead's impossible.

39:21.920 --> 39:23.040
So to save some,

39:23.120 --> 39:25.407
I cut them back to a meal
a day per head now.

39:25.600 --> 39:27.520
A few of them started getting' fidgety,

39:27.600 --> 39:29.011
so I had Abner come down on 'em.

39:29.240 --> 39:32.961
Abner, here...
he's my only real protection.

39:33.160 --> 39:35.845
Now, they needs to mind me.
You speak on that.

39:36.080 --> 39:38.924
They treasure in Heaven
from submittin' and all.

39:39.120 --> 39:42.240
If they gets to moanin' or carryin' on,

39:42.320 --> 39:43.685
you don't pay 'em no mind...

39:43.920 --> 39:45.400
because they lazy as all hell.

39:45.480 --> 39:47.926
They do anything to get outta work.

39:48.120 --> 39:49.690
You ready, boy?

40:03.760 --> 40:06.969
Listen up! Got a preacher here tonight.

40:07.160 --> 40:09.162
Come here, boy.

40:11.160 --> 40:13.322
Now, he's a nigger here like y'all...

40:13.520 --> 40:15.966
and he's here to talk to you
about the Lord.

40:16.160 --> 40:17.730
So you listen to him

40:17.840 --> 40:22.323
and you might just make it
into Heaven, you hear?

40:53.360 --> 40:56.204
Brothers and sisters.

41:00.760 --> 41:06.210
I lead you to... Peter 2:18.

41:08.440 --> 41:12.764
"Slaves, submit yourselves...

41:13.000 --> 41:16.561
"to your masters with all respect."

41:17.400 --> 41:21.246
"Not only to those who are
good and considerate...

41:23.040 --> 41:27.568
"but also to those... who are harsh."

41:35.920 --> 41:38.048
You sure you don't wanna stay the night?

41:38.240 --> 41:39.720
Got some fine brandy

41:39.800 --> 41:42.406
and a couple of choice wenches
in the cellar.

41:42.640 --> 41:45.610
Get Abner here to strike out
the fiddle and...

41:45.800 --> 41:48.929
sit around the fire,
tell some old lies, huh?

41:49.440 --> 41:51.602
No. We best be gettin' back
before sun go down.

41:51.800 --> 41:54.804
All right. Suit yourself.

41:55.040 --> 41:56.485
Would take a bottle of that brandy,

41:56.600 --> 41:57.601
if you could spare it.

41:57.800 --> 42:00.610
Oh, sure thing. Abner?

42:01.080 --> 42:02.764
I got a chocolate one here

42:02.880 --> 42:05.645
that does it right every time.

42:06.440 --> 42:08.807
You sure you don't wanna stay?

42:09.080 --> 42:11.447
No, they expectin' us back.
You know how it is.

42:11.920 --> 42:13.604
All right.

42:14.960 --> 42:18.282
You's a smart man, Sam.

42:18.440 --> 42:20.920
Man make a fortune with that boy.

42:27.640 --> 42:29.400
Great doin' business with you.

42:33.800 --> 42:35.325
Let's go.

42:56.480 --> 42:58.687
You all right?

42:59.680 --> 43:02.331
Yeah.

43:07.880 --> 43:10.121
The dress there.

43:10.680 --> 43:13.126
That the one you were wearing that day?

43:14.880 --> 43:16.848
Yes.

43:17.360 --> 43:19.681
Momma offered you one of hers?

43:20.200 --> 43:22.362
She did.

43:39.160 --> 43:41.925
"Abigail Hayne."

43:42.160 --> 43:44.162
My momma.

43:46.920 --> 43:50.720
"Madison Hayne." Who was that?

43:51.360 --> 43:53.169
That's me.

43:54.160 --> 43:56.162
My momma...

43:57.160 --> 44:00.164
she put this dress on me...

44:00.400 --> 44:03.210
the day they took me from her.

44:03.720 --> 44:07.202
Showed me this here patch.

44:07.400 --> 44:11.200
Told me to never forget who I was...

44:11.400 --> 44:13.971
and that I had a momma.

44:14.200 --> 44:17.409
And that she was somewhere...

44:17.560 --> 44:21.565
missing me and loving me.

44:23.760 --> 44:25.524
I was 13.

44:32.600 --> 44:35.206
I can call ya Madison, if ya like.

44:35.440 --> 44:38.444
You can call me whatever you want.

44:38.600 --> 44:41.604
I'll call you Queen.

44:45.640 --> 44:47.449
What's wrong?

44:50.920 --> 44:52.331
We're gonna have a baby.

44:54.760 --> 44:56.762
A baby?

45:00.440 --> 45:02.442
You sure?

45:09.440 --> 45:11.442
You mad?

45:12.000 --> 45:14.480
Mad?

45:14.600 --> 45:16.841
No. No.

45:18.480 --> 45:20.482
I ain't mad.

45:39.040 --> 45:40.690
"...as the eyes of the servants

45:40.840 --> 45:43.047
look unto the hand of their masters...

45:43.280 --> 45:44.361
"and the eyes of a maid

45:44.480 --> 45:46.687
"look unto the hand of her mistress..."

45:57.040 --> 45:58.800
"...and Noah awoke from his wine

45:58.880 --> 46:00.530
"and knew what his youngest son

46:00.640 --> 46:01.846
"had done unto him.

46:02.040 --> 46:04.850
"And he said, 'Cursed be Canaan."'

46:15.480 --> 46:18.689
"...servant of servants
shall he be unto his brethren.

46:18.880 --> 46:20.960
"And he said, Blessed be the Lord,

46:21.040 --> 46:23.691
"God of Shem, and Canaan..."

46:50.240 --> 46:52.242
Wait here.

47:06.400 --> 47:08.084
I'll go check 'round back.

47:08.240 --> 47:09.810
Yessum.

47:31.760 --> 47:33.171
Whatcha doin' on my land?

47:33.320 --> 47:34.765
Hey! Call off your dog!

47:34.960 --> 47:35.961
Whatcha doin' on my land?

47:36.120 --> 47:37.690
No! He's with me!

47:38.840 --> 47:40.520
Who the hell are you?

47:40.600 --> 47:43.206
I'm Samuel Turner.
Reverend Walthall sent us.

47:44.000 --> 47:45.800
Fella with the nigger preacher.

47:47.120 --> 47:48.610
Come on!

47:48.840 --> 47:51.286
Let's go find Earl.

47:54.040 --> 47:56.850
You all right? Come on.

47:57.040 --> 47:59.281
Niggers is niggers here.

47:59.680 --> 48:02.843
Now, we don't treat none
no different than another.

48:03.480 --> 48:05.050
We got rules.

48:05.280 --> 48:07.521
Cost of breakin' 'em, stealin', sassin'...

48:07.720 --> 48:09.529
or any other thing that Earl and I think

48:09.640 --> 48:12.325
worth dealin' with,
will be paid for in skin.

48:12.480 --> 48:15.051
You interfere with that...

48:15.320 --> 48:17.527
we'll shoot you where you stand.

48:17.720 --> 48:19.000
Got any problem with that,

48:19.080 --> 48:22.163
you can stop right now and go
on back where you came from.

48:26.840 --> 48:29.241
Come on now! Come on!

48:30.480 --> 48:32.005
Earl!

48:32.200 --> 48:34.043
This here is Sam Turner,

48:34.160 --> 48:35.844
fella with the nigger preacher.

48:40.760 --> 48:42.046
Where you say you come from?

48:42.160 --> 48:44.322
We from here. Southampton County.

48:44.520 --> 48:45.681
Just south of Nottoway.

48:45.840 --> 48:46.887
Mmm.

48:47.080 --> 48:48.960
Lotta Yankees makin' their way
down that way.

48:49.040 --> 48:51.691
Rabble-rousin', stirring shit
on our way of life.

48:52.160 --> 48:54.960
They're pullin' that same shit.

48:55.040 --> 48:57.691
Earl. Got a little problem.

49:15.360 --> 49:16.320
Which one?

49:16.400 --> 49:17.401
This one.

49:17.520 --> 49:19.090
How long?

49:19.200 --> 49:21.965
Mmm. About a day or so.

49:25.080 --> 49:28.050
You ain't gonna eat, hmm?

49:31.040 --> 49:33.720
You gonna eat? Come on.
You ain't gonna eat?

49:33.800 --> 49:35.768
Hmm? Hmm? Hmm?

49:36.240 --> 49:38.163
All right.

49:38.760 --> 49:41.411
If it ain't one thing, it's another.

50:01.600 --> 50:04.604
You wonderin' why we could
use that nigger of yours?

50:05.160 --> 50:07.527
You're seein' it firsthand.
All right, get his mouth open.

50:08.920 --> 50:11.080
Well, if it ain't the Yanks...

50:12.320 --> 50:13.845
it's the drought.

50:14.320 --> 50:16.004
If not the drought...

50:18.760 --> 50:20.125
it's goddamn mutiny.

50:24.200 --> 50:26.202
Get a funnel in there.

50:44.440 --> 50:46.800
Truth is, even the meanest nigger's

50:46.880 --> 50:48.848
fearful of the Gospel.

50:49.480 --> 50:52.211
Maybe a good word from your boy there...

50:52.480 --> 50:55.882
discipline word, go a lot
further than my pistol would.

50:56.840 --> 50:58.760
Nat's a... good preacher.

50:58.840 --> 51:01.810
I don't right care how good he is...

51:02.000 --> 51:04.651
long as he say what he's supposed to.

51:32.200 --> 51:33.690
Brethren.

51:35.520 --> 51:40.526
I pray you sing to the Lord...

51:42.040 --> 51:44.247
a new song.

51:48.200 --> 51:52.967
Sing praise in assembly of the righteous.

51:53.680 --> 51:57.287
Let the saints be joyful in glory.

51:57.800 --> 52:00.531
Let them sing aloud on their beds.

52:00.720 --> 52:01.767
Let the high praise of God

52:01.880 --> 52:03.200
be on the mouths of the saints...

52:03.280 --> 52:04.960
and a two-edge sword in their hand

52:05.040 --> 52:07.441
to execute vengeance
on the demonic nations...

52:07.720 --> 52:09.200
and punishment on those peoples

52:09.280 --> 52:10.964
to bind their kings with chains...

52:11.200 --> 52:13.441
and their nobles with fetters of iron

52:13.560 --> 52:15.562
to execute on them this written judgment.

52:15.720 --> 52:17.640
This honor hath all his saints!

52:17.720 --> 52:18.801
Praise the Lord!

52:19.040 --> 52:23.045
Praise the Lord! Sing to him a new song!

52:23.920 --> 52:27.288
Praise the Lord! Praise the Lord!

52:56.360 --> 52:58.124
Don't suppose you got a pass anywhere

52:58.240 --> 53:00.368
underneath that pretty dress.

53:01.120 --> 53:02.400
No, sir.

53:02.480 --> 53:05.290
I belongs to Massa Guiles
and this here his property.

53:05.440 --> 53:07.124
You sassin' me, girl?

53:08.080 --> 53:09.080
No, sir.

53:09.160 --> 53:11.322
Anybody that knows nothin'
knows that state law says...

53:11.440 --> 53:14.364
that if a nigger's less than
10 paces from a tree line...

53:14.680 --> 53:15.806
that nigger need a pass.

53:17.480 --> 53:20.609
Well, sir, I can get one.

53:20.800 --> 53:23.280
You ain't goin' nowhere.

53:23.440 --> 53:25.602
Either you gonna show me a pass,

53:25.720 --> 53:27.722
or you gonna show me somethin' else.

53:32.960 --> 53:33.920
What?

53:34.000 --> 53:35.365
I'm sorry to disturb ya,

53:35.480 --> 53:37.403
but Nat's gotta talk to you.

53:37.640 --> 53:39.642
Somethin' awful had happened.

53:39.800 --> 53:42.644
Whatever it is, just tell him
I'll get to it in the mornin'.

53:42.800 --> 53:45.640
Massa, if you could just see Nat

53:45.720 --> 53:47.006
for just a moment, I...

53:47.240 --> 53:49.641
Goddamnit, Isaiah.

53:52.040 --> 53:54.486
All right, tell him I'll meet him
on the front porch.

53:54.680 --> 53:56.808
I'm right here, sir.

53:57.640 --> 53:59.244
Might as well come in then.

54:00.840 --> 54:04.640
Sir, I am awfully sorry
about all this. I...

54:05.200 --> 54:06.240
What is it, Nat?

54:06.320 --> 54:09.529
Cherry... she's been hurt real bad.

54:09.760 --> 54:11.842
Whatcha mean hurt?

54:12.840 --> 54:15.081
A group of men... sir.

54:19.160 --> 54:20.571
Isaiah, fetch me some paper.

54:20.720 --> 54:22.051
Yeah.

54:24.840 --> 54:26.842
All right, you should go down there.

54:27.040 --> 54:29.691
Take Jupiter, but don't start no trouble.

54:29.840 --> 54:32.730
Stay the night, come back
first thing in the morning.

54:32.920 --> 54:36.367
Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.

54:57.480 --> 54:59.801
God's gonna punish whoever did this.

55:00.880 --> 55:02.723
Monsters.

56:04.320 --> 56:05.765
Nat?

56:05.960 --> 56:07.325
I'm right here.

56:07.520 --> 56:09.329
I'm right here.

56:11.960 --> 56:14.122
It's me now.

56:14.320 --> 56:16.891
I'm right here.

56:19.480 --> 56:21.562
I'm sorry.

56:21.800 --> 56:25.566
No, no. You don't apologize.

56:26.160 --> 56:28.367
You don't owe that to nobody.

56:32.800 --> 56:35.804
You need to tell me who done this to you.

56:35.960 --> 56:38.361
'Cause I'm gonna
take care of it, you hear?

56:38.560 --> 56:40.801
On my soul.

56:44.360 --> 56:47.011
I need you to tell me now.

57:12.600 --> 57:18.004
"Put up again thy sword into His place.

57:20.040 --> 57:23.601
"For all they that take the sword...

57:24.280 --> 57:27.409
"shall pass with the sword."

57:29.600 --> 57:32.410
You taught me that.

57:37.640 --> 57:40.644
I need you here.

57:41.880 --> 57:44.042
Joanna, too.

57:46.640 --> 57:49.644
Leave this to the Lord.

58:05.880 --> 58:07.484
You wanted to see me, sir?

58:12.080 --> 58:13.889
Yeah. How's Cherry?

58:14.080 --> 58:15.923
I'm believin' she'll be fine.

58:16.080 --> 58:18.003
Good. Good.

58:19.280 --> 58:21.760
Not many woulda let you go like I did.

58:22.640 --> 58:25.041
- Thank you, sir.
- Mmm.

58:26.160 --> 58:29.249
We're having a big get-together tonight
with a lot of very important people.

58:29.760 --> 58:32.360
Kind of like when Daddy was alive.

58:32.440 --> 58:34.607
So I'm gonna need you
and a couple of others in the house.

58:34.760 --> 58:38.721
Anyone who's had experience
servin' and being respectable help.

58:40.120 --> 58:41.120
Yes, sir.

58:41.200 --> 58:43.680
Can't tell ya how important
this is for all of us.

58:43.880 --> 58:47.287
If we get this right, the Turner name
will mean something again.

58:50.440 --> 58:52.204
Isaiah.

58:53.600 --> 58:55.443
Yes, sir.

59:45.960 --> 59:47.920
As you all know, this annual dinner

59:48.000 --> 59:50.128
was a tradition
of our daddy many years ago.

59:50.320 --> 59:53.360
And for all he believed,
he placed family, faith,

59:53.440 --> 59:55.488
and tradition at the top
of his priority list.

59:55.680 --> 59:59.805
Twenty years later, those same priorities
have kept this property afloat.

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:02.082
That and the cash down
from your colored preacher.

01:00:03.360 --> 01:00:05.124
- Yeah!
- That, too.

01:00:05.320 --> 01:00:09.165
May God continue to bless all of us
for many generations to come.

01:00:09.760 --> 01:00:12.161
Hear, hear.

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:14.680
Nat, would you please lead us in prayer?

01:00:14.760 --> 01:00:16.171
Reverend, I trust you wouldn't mind.

01:00:16.800 --> 01:00:18.802
I guess not.

01:00:29.800 --> 01:00:32.007
Heavenly Father.

01:00:32.200 --> 01:00:35.886
We come to thank You
for Your word and Your will.

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:40.571
We pray for and thank You

01:00:40.680 --> 01:00:43.809
for Your protection and Your promise.

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:46.400
And in our obedience,

01:00:46.480 --> 01:00:50.320
You will be an enemy to our enemies.

01:00:50.400 --> 01:00:54.405
That you will oppose those who oppose us.

01:00:58.400 --> 01:01:00.562
Continue to guide us, O Lord...

01:01:00.840 --> 01:01:03.411
and we will continue to follow.

01:01:04.040 --> 01:01:06.407
Through fine tribulation
we will push forward...

01:01:06.600 --> 01:01:10.844
recognizing only You
as our source and strength.

01:01:12.600 --> 01:01:15.604
In Your holy name we pray.

01:01:15.840 --> 01:01:17.760
Amen.

01:01:17.840 --> 01:01:18.840
Bon appétit.

01:01:20.720 --> 01:01:22.085
Daddy always said,

01:01:22.240 --> 01:01:24.607
"Three black peppercorns
in a glass of port...

01:01:24.840 --> 01:01:28.083
"and you got yourself
a excellent digestif."

01:01:28.280 --> 01:01:30.282
Well, black is always tasty.

01:01:30.440 --> 01:01:36.280
Especially a nice piece
of black meat. Sweet. Juicy.

01:01:38.360 --> 01:01:39.360
I ain't doin' it, all right?

01:01:39.440 --> 01:01:40.885
Naw, naw. I need you to get out of here!

01:01:41.080 --> 01:01:45.244
Ain't gonna happen, man.
You just come out here...

01:01:45.440 --> 01:01:48.125
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey! Ho, ho, ho!

01:01:48.240 --> 01:01:50.200
What's goin' on, huh?

01:01:50.280 --> 01:01:51.441
- I ain't doin' it.
- Huh?

01:01:51.600 --> 01:01:53.284
- I ain't doin' it, Nat.
- Doin' what?

01:01:53.480 --> 01:01:55.200
He'd have to lynch me first.

01:01:55.280 --> 01:01:57.487
Lynch ya? What are we talkin' about?

01:01:58.440 --> 01:02:01.649
One of Samuel's guests...

01:02:03.120 --> 01:02:04.724
What?

01:02:06.880 --> 01:02:10.965
One of Samuel's guests
requested Esther, and, uh...

01:02:17.920 --> 01:02:20.480
Just go and talk to Samuel.
Just tell him what happened.

01:02:20.560 --> 01:02:22.324
Tell him what it was
and he'll straighten this out.

01:02:22.440 --> 01:02:25.649
But Samuel sent me
over here personally, Nat.

01:02:25.920 --> 01:02:29.925
I can't do it, Nat. I won't.

01:02:30.120 --> 01:02:31.690
Brother Hark...

01:02:31.840 --> 01:02:33.320
But, what... Who are you?

01:02:33.400 --> 01:02:34.840
Brother Hark, do you think

01:02:34.920 --> 01:02:37.764
that I wanna come over here for this?

01:02:38.240 --> 01:02:40.129
You here, ain't ya?

01:02:41.280 --> 01:02:43.089
Nat!

01:02:45.280 --> 01:02:46.280
Where is she?

01:02:46.360 --> 01:02:49.204
Samuel, sir. Please, you can't do this.

01:02:52.840 --> 01:02:54.604
Everything all right?

01:02:54.760 --> 01:02:56.524
Oh, it's just fine.

01:02:56.680 --> 01:02:58.330
I'll be inside directly.

01:02:58.480 --> 01:03:00.050
I hope you won't be alone.

01:03:00.160 --> 01:03:03.960
I assure you, I will not be.

01:03:05.160 --> 01:03:07.367
If you mess this up for me,
my hand to God...

01:03:07.600 --> 01:03:09.602
I will lynch every one of you come mornin!

01:03:09.720 --> 01:03:11.440
Do you understand me?

01:03:13.360 --> 01:03:14.361
Fetch her.

01:03:14.560 --> 01:03:15.561
Yes, sir.

01:04:13.600 --> 01:04:15.602
It's okay.

01:04:30.600 --> 01:04:34.047
Where is He, Nat? Where's God now?

01:04:44.800 --> 01:04:46.643
Hark.

01:04:54.800 --> 01:04:56.802
Excuse me.

01:04:57.640 --> 01:05:00.644
I'm looking for a preacher named Nat.

01:05:01.760 --> 01:05:04.081
He's been banned from every church
in the county for his sins.

01:05:04.280 --> 01:05:06.726
He's lucky that's all he got
for what he done.

01:05:06.960 --> 01:05:09.645
The world has its way
with dealing with the immoral.

01:05:09.840 --> 01:05:14.482
Above all those who cast that immorality
on the children as he has.

01:05:15.080 --> 01:05:18.289
But no one is without sin, Miss Elizabeth.

01:05:18.840 --> 01:05:21.684
And this man wants to repent
and be delivered.

01:05:21.840 --> 01:05:26.528
As a Shepherd of the Lord,
it's my duty to serve.

01:05:26.680 --> 01:05:28.682
So...

01:05:29.680 --> 01:05:31.842
I'd like to baptize him.

01:05:32.520 --> 01:05:33.520
The hell you will!

01:05:33.600 --> 01:05:34.931
Jethro, you will mind your mouth.

01:05:35.160 --> 01:05:39.125
With respect, Miss Elizabeth,
a nigger can't baptize no white man.

01:05:40.160 --> 01:05:42.686
I just think we should wait
for Mr. Samuel to get back.

01:05:42.920 --> 01:05:44.120
Jethro, go wait in the front yard.

01:05:44.200 --> 01:05:45.850
Mr. Samuel gets back,
he'll have both of us!

01:05:46.040 --> 01:05:48.327
I won't ask you again.

01:05:50.880 --> 01:05:53.121
Boy, you gonna get it.

01:05:57.200 --> 01:05:59.040
Are you sure you want to do this, Nat?

01:05:59.120 --> 01:06:01.122
Samuel may not like it.

01:06:01.320 --> 01:06:03.368
Nor will a lot of other folks around here.

01:06:04.120 --> 01:06:07.124
Don't got too much choice, missus.

01:06:07.720 --> 01:06:10.564
This man still belongs to God.

01:06:10.880 --> 01:06:13.884
When you stand between
the Lord and his people...

01:06:14.120 --> 01:06:16.726
it's a dangerous place to be.

01:07:17.200 --> 01:07:20.204
We've been good to you.
My whole family has.

01:07:20.400 --> 01:07:23.404
And you go on and do
something like this to me.

01:07:23.640 --> 01:07:27.406
A nigger baptizing a white man
on my property!

01:07:27.640 --> 01:07:29.290
Do you know how this makes us look?

01:07:29.440 --> 01:07:32.603
This could ruin everything we worked for!

01:07:33.120 --> 01:07:36.203
Boy, you better say something and quick!

01:07:37.440 --> 01:07:39.807
"Take heed therefore unto yourselves...

01:07:39.960 --> 01:07:41.240
"and to all the flock over which

01:07:41.320 --> 01:07:43.448
"the Holy Ghost hath made you overseers.

01:07:43.640 --> 01:07:45.080
"To feed the church of God

01:07:45.160 --> 01:07:48.243
"which He has purchased
with his own blood."

01:07:49.120 --> 01:07:50.160
Ex...

01:07:50.240 --> 01:07:52.000
"Exhort servants

01:07:52.080 --> 01:07:55.004
"to be obedient to thy own masters...

01:07:55.240 --> 01:07:58.005
"and to please them well
in all things not answering again..."

01:07:58.240 --> 01:08:01.244
"You were bought with a price,
do not become slaves of men."

01:08:01.440 --> 01:08:04.240
"He that shall blaspheme
against the Holy Ghost

01:08:04.320 --> 01:08:06.846
"hath never forgiveness,
but is in danger..."

01:08:07.080 --> 01:08:09.920
"Beware of false prophets
who come dressed in sheep's clothing...

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:11.525
"but inwardly are ravening wolves!"

01:08:11.760 --> 01:08:13.171
- You black bastard!
- Nat!

01:08:13.440 --> 01:08:14.600
"He that stealeth a man
and selleth him..."

01:08:14.680 --> 01:08:15.760
Don't you eyeball me, boy!

01:08:15.840 --> 01:08:17.080
"...or if he be found
in his hand, he shall surely

01:08:17.160 --> 01:08:18.161
"be put to death!"

01:08:28.040 --> 01:08:29.849
Get him to the post.

01:09:38.760 --> 01:09:40.760
Hey, boy.

01:09:43.080 --> 01:09:46.084
If you make it out of this alive...

01:09:47.120 --> 01:09:50.920
I'm gonna ride you harder
than hogs on slop.

01:09:54.960 --> 01:09:56.962
Die.

01:12:12.920 --> 01:12:15.491
You learned your lesson, boy?

01:12:17.240 --> 01:12:20.926
Oh, yes, sir, I've learned.

01:12:21.600 --> 01:12:23.523
Go on, get him off.

01:12:28.560 --> 01:12:30.528
You're done preachin' for a little while.

01:12:30.720 --> 01:12:32.609
And I don't want you
runnin' off with any groups,

01:12:32.720 --> 01:12:35.291
unless me and Jethro
are there, you understand?

01:12:35.520 --> 01:12:37.522
Yes, sir.

01:12:38.080 --> 01:12:39.923
All right, go and get yourself cleaned up.

01:12:40.120 --> 01:12:42.726
Be back in the field come morning.

01:12:58.640 --> 01:13:00.768
Brother, you all right?

01:13:03.120 --> 01:13:05.248
Hey! Hey!

01:13:20.320 --> 01:13:22.687
I watched your grandfather die...

01:13:22.960 --> 01:13:25.327
in old land.

01:13:27.160 --> 01:13:30.607
Saw him give up the ghost
with my own eyes.

01:13:31.480 --> 01:13:33.482
And he saw me.

01:13:34.520 --> 01:13:37.171
He harnessed the Holy Spirit that day.

01:13:37.280 --> 01:13:39.487
Yes, he did.

01:13:40.120 --> 01:13:41.281
I was proud of him.

01:13:43.520 --> 01:13:45.522
So proud.

01:13:46.040 --> 01:13:47.690
I still thank God...

01:13:49.960 --> 01:13:52.361
that he died that day.

01:13:53.160 --> 01:13:56.528
That he didn't live to see
the things I seen.

01:14:00.880 --> 01:14:04.202
To watch a strong man broken down...

01:14:05.720 --> 01:14:08.371
is a terrible thing.

01:14:43.560 --> 01:14:45.722
Hey, Nana.

01:14:51.920 --> 01:14:54.241
The stitches held up good.

01:15:07.600 --> 01:15:09.602
Nana?

01:16:11.800 --> 01:16:13.643
You all right?

01:16:21.480 --> 01:16:23.130
Mostly.

01:16:32.320 --> 01:16:35.722
I need you to round up
a few men you trust.

01:16:35.840 --> 01:16:37.320
Have them meet us at the big cypress

01:16:37.400 --> 01:16:39.880
at Cabin Pond night after next.

01:16:42.520 --> 01:16:44.363
Hark.

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:47.685
He's still here, brother.

01:16:48.880 --> 01:16:51.167
Even now.

01:17:09.840 --> 01:17:11.569
This is Simon.

01:17:12.360 --> 01:17:14.567
Samuel bought him a month back in Norfolk.

01:17:15.080 --> 01:17:16.684
I remember. Welcome, brother.

01:17:16.840 --> 01:17:18.410
And you knew Nelson.

01:17:19.560 --> 01:17:21.005
Welcome.

01:17:21.160 --> 01:17:22.571
This is Will.

01:17:23.560 --> 01:17:26.370
Word travels fast. Welcome.

01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:30.571
Hey! This grown folk's business! Get! Get!

01:17:30.760 --> 01:17:32.205
Hold on.

01:17:32.400 --> 01:17:34.209
Come on over here.

01:17:39.400 --> 01:17:40.401
Come from Randall's?

01:17:40.560 --> 01:17:41.561
Yes, sir.

01:17:41.760 --> 01:17:43.205
He's just a boy.

01:17:43.360 --> 01:17:44.771
So was David.

01:17:46.440 --> 01:17:48.966
Come on. Have a seat.

01:18:00.200 --> 01:18:03.249
I've been following the Lord a long time.

01:18:03.440 --> 01:18:06.967
Preachin', citing scripture...

01:18:07.240 --> 01:18:09.766
sharing the Gospel from the few pages

01:18:09.880 --> 01:18:11.769
and sections I've been allowed.

01:18:11.920 --> 01:18:14.969
But I've gone back
through this Word, all of it.

01:18:15.080 --> 01:18:17.003
With new eyes.

01:18:17.240 --> 01:18:18.969
I see now, for every verse

01:18:19.080 --> 01:18:20.491
they use to support our bondage...

01:18:20.720 --> 01:18:22.802
there's another demanding our freedom.

01:18:22.960 --> 01:18:27.010
Every verse they use
to justify our torture...

01:18:27.240 --> 01:18:30.289
there's another damning them
to Hell for those actions.

01:18:31.800 --> 01:18:35.691
Lord has spoken to me.
Visions of what's to come.

01:18:35.800 --> 01:18:38.246
A rise of good against evil.

01:18:38.480 --> 01:18:42.007
The first shall be last,
and the last shall be first.

01:18:45.800 --> 01:18:48.167
Brothers, we've been chosen.

01:18:48.360 --> 01:18:50.169
What are we gonna do?

01:18:50.320 --> 01:18:52.004
Same as David and Gideon...

01:18:52.280 --> 01:18:55.807
and Joshua and Samson.

01:18:56.640 --> 01:18:58.608
- We'll fight.
- The six of us?

01:18:58.800 --> 01:19:02.200
At first. But once it begins,
our brothers and sisters will join.

01:19:02.440 --> 01:19:03.851
There's a whole lot of whites.

01:19:03.960 --> 01:19:05.485
How many slaves you think
there are in the county?

01:19:05.680 --> 01:19:09.048
On all the plantations? How many whites?

01:19:09.480 --> 01:19:10.720
But they got guns.

01:19:10.840 --> 01:19:12.046
We'll take the armory in Jerusalem.

01:19:12.280 --> 01:19:13.805
We'll have guns, too.

01:19:13.960 --> 01:19:15.530
Jerusalem?

01:19:15.680 --> 01:19:17.682
That's right. It's only 10 miles north.

01:19:18.200 --> 01:19:19.531
We'll start right here at Turner's

01:19:19.640 --> 01:19:20.846
and fight our way there.

01:19:21.040 --> 01:19:22.800
By then we'll number in the hundreds,

01:19:22.880 --> 01:19:24.644
thousands even.

01:19:24.840 --> 01:19:27.525
The grapevine's ablaze
with talks of fightin'.

01:19:27.680 --> 01:19:30.047
Slaves all over havin' meetins'.

01:19:30.200 --> 01:19:31.850
They waitin' on something.

01:19:32.040 --> 01:19:33.485
They waitin' on us.

01:19:36.880 --> 01:19:38.564
We make a stop at Fowler place?

01:19:38.680 --> 01:19:40.364
We will.

01:19:42.880 --> 01:19:44.006
I'm with you.

01:19:44.160 --> 01:19:45.207
Me, too.

01:19:45.400 --> 01:19:47.209
- When we fight?
- Soon.

01:19:47.360 --> 01:19:49.522
The Lord will give us a sign.

01:19:49.720 --> 01:19:51.210
Until then we remain steadfast,

01:19:51.320 --> 01:19:53.721
ready to strike at the moment
of the Lord's call.

01:19:54.080 --> 01:19:55.889
With the strength of our Father,

01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:57.525
we'll cut the head from the serpent.

01:19:58.720 --> 01:20:00.927
We'll destroy them all.

01:20:31.760 --> 01:20:32.807
Somethin' wrong?

01:20:32.920 --> 01:20:35.764
There was a meeting a few nights ago.

01:20:35.960 --> 01:20:38.611
And although I was not
privy to what was said...

01:20:38.760 --> 01:20:40.922
I can only assume...

01:20:41.120 --> 01:20:45.045
by the secrecy that it was not
altogether productive.

01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:04.560
Now, I don't know what ideas

01:21:04.640 --> 01:21:06.961
is floatin' around in your head...

01:21:08.160 --> 01:21:10.288
but I been around here
long enough to know...

01:21:10.440 --> 01:21:12.488
that the result of certain ideas

01:21:12.600 --> 01:21:14.648
is not gonna get you what you want.

01:21:14.800 --> 01:21:16.962
All I want...

01:21:17.160 --> 01:21:19.162
I want for the oppressed people of God.

01:21:19.400 --> 01:21:21.801
You want death for them?

01:21:23.240 --> 01:21:24.241
For your wife?

01:21:25.960 --> 01:21:27.121
For your daughter?

01:21:27.280 --> 01:21:28.441
If it be God's will.

01:21:28.640 --> 01:21:30.642
God's will?

01:21:32.160 --> 01:21:33.880
And who determined you

01:21:33.960 --> 01:21:35.849
to be the instrument of such a thing?

01:21:36.440 --> 01:21:37.771
He has.

01:21:42.800 --> 01:21:43.847
You just make sure that

01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:45.206
He's the one doin' the orderin'.

01:21:45.440 --> 01:21:50.207
Man of God is called to lead in love.

01:21:50.440 --> 01:21:53.489
Anything else will leave us all worse off.

01:21:53.720 --> 01:21:57.008
He is a god of love, Nat.

01:21:57.200 --> 01:21:59.680
Don't you forget that.

01:21:59.840 --> 01:22:01.683
I won't.

01:22:01.840 --> 01:22:04.844
Nor will I forget He's a god of wrath.

01:22:17.480 --> 01:22:18.561
Mmm...

01:22:32.040 --> 01:22:34.247
The Lord's calling me.

01:22:36.840 --> 01:22:38.080
To stand and fight.

01:22:48.880 --> 01:22:51.884
I knew this day would come.

01:22:53.720 --> 01:22:58.044
I told myself I wouldn't be scared.

01:22:59.880 --> 01:23:02.087
All my life...

01:23:02.280 --> 01:23:06.524
I've been praying
for the Lord to help us...

01:23:06.960 --> 01:23:10.089
or to send someone who could.

01:23:11.080 --> 01:23:13.082
We all have.

01:23:14.280 --> 01:23:18.922
Just wasn't expecting it
to be my own husband.

01:23:31.760 --> 01:23:34.240
If the Lord's called you to fight...

01:23:35.640 --> 01:23:37.768
you fight.

01:23:38.760 --> 01:23:41.331
You fight for me...

01:23:42.320 --> 01:23:44.561
and Joanna.

01:23:48.120 --> 01:23:51.124
You fight for us all.

01:23:51.800 --> 01:23:52.847
Hmm?

01:25:02.400 --> 01:25:04.402
Who's there?

01:25:09.400 --> 01:25:11.050
Nat?

01:25:11.200 --> 01:25:12.850
Yes.

01:25:31.680 --> 01:25:33.682
Wait, goddamnit!

01:25:38.040 --> 01:25:39.451
Damn it!

01:27:16.760 --> 01:27:18.330
Momma?

01:27:22.160 --> 01:27:23.810
Momma.

01:27:25.520 --> 01:27:28.524
Nat? Oh, Lord, I slept too late.

01:27:28.800 --> 01:27:30.689
No, no... Momma.

01:27:32.520 --> 01:27:34.807
You won't have to work today.

01:27:35.560 --> 01:27:37.324
You free.

01:27:45.520 --> 01:27:47.841
The battle's begun, Ma.

01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:50.809
Simon.

01:27:54.320 --> 01:27:56.561
Simon will take you to Reese's.

01:27:56.800 --> 01:27:58.564
And I need you to take care
of Cherry and Joanna

01:27:58.680 --> 01:28:00.569
'till I get back, you hear?

01:28:03.360 --> 01:28:05.044
What's wrong?

01:28:05.200 --> 01:28:06.770
Nothing.

01:28:08.720 --> 01:28:10.563
I'm proud of you.

01:28:28.720 --> 01:28:30.370
What did you do, boy? Huh?

01:28:31.280 --> 01:28:32.520
Huh? You killed them, boy?

01:28:32.600 --> 01:28:34.523
Is that what you did?

01:28:34.720 --> 01:28:38.406
You kill them and you kill us!

01:28:43.400 --> 01:28:46.085
You killed all of us.

01:28:46.240 --> 01:28:49.403
We already dead. We already dead!

01:28:51.120 --> 01:28:53.248
You dead.

01:28:53.440 --> 01:28:55.761
We already dead.

01:28:59.440 --> 01:29:02.091
We dead now!

01:29:08.440 --> 01:29:10.090
Your...

01:29:10.280 --> 01:29:13.250
earthly master is gone.

01:29:14.440 --> 01:29:18.286
You're now free men and women...

01:29:18.440 --> 01:29:20.124
servants of only the Lord.

01:29:21.760 --> 01:29:25.128
As the sword of the Lord
bears down on our enemies...

01:29:25.280 --> 01:29:27.965
our ancestors and unborn children rejoice.

01:29:29.440 --> 01:29:31.442
Are we dead?

01:29:34.920 --> 01:29:38.288
No. I say we are now alive...

01:29:38.440 --> 01:29:40.329
seeing through eyes
that have been denied us...

01:29:40.440 --> 01:29:43.489
since being born
into the darkness of bondage.

01:29:46.240 --> 01:29:47.200
Stand with us.

01:29:47.280 --> 01:29:49.123
Let your other captive
brothers and sisters

01:29:49.240 --> 01:29:50.321
also know freedom.

01:29:50.480 --> 01:29:53.491
Stand that our children
for generations to come will know...

01:29:53.680 --> 01:29:55.205
that with the supernatural power of God...

01:29:55.320 --> 01:29:58.648
we straightened our backs
against the works of the evil one!

01:30:00.840 --> 01:30:02.922
Stand with us.

01:30:56.480 --> 01:30:58.767
Can I do this myself?

01:31:56.600 --> 01:31:59.604
The boy! He gone!

01:32:08.440 --> 01:32:10.442
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

01:32:29.800 --> 01:32:31.484
Get down!

01:32:34.080 --> 01:32:35.491
Hey, preacher!

01:32:35.640 --> 01:32:37.085
Hark!

01:32:37.320 --> 01:32:39.163
Are you out there?

01:32:39.320 --> 01:32:40.685
Tell the men to fall back.

01:32:40.840 --> 01:32:42.330
What?

01:32:42.480 --> 01:32:45.080
If we have a gun battle now,
we'll never make it to Jerusalem.

01:32:45.160 --> 01:32:46.207
Me and my boys is ready!

01:32:46.320 --> 01:32:47.400
I want my revenge!

01:32:47.480 --> 01:32:48.686
This ain't about revenge, Hark!

01:32:48.800 --> 01:32:51.804
You all gonna hang! You hear me?

01:32:51.960 --> 01:32:53.644
All of ya!

01:32:55.840 --> 01:32:57.888
The root...

01:32:58.120 --> 01:32:59.167
not the branch.

01:33:01.480 --> 01:33:03.005
We must stay focused, brother.

01:33:05.840 --> 01:33:08.525
Will! Fall back! C'mon!
C'mon, y'all. C'mon.

01:33:08.720 --> 01:33:10.802
Let's fall back, y'all!

01:33:35.520 --> 01:33:37.363
You all right?

01:33:40.040 --> 01:33:42.120
It's all of us.

01:33:42.200 --> 01:33:43.326
This it?

01:34:02.880 --> 01:34:04.928
Hark, what time you think it is?

01:34:05.920 --> 01:34:08.730
5:30, 5:35.

01:34:12.400 --> 01:34:14.402
What?

01:34:16.760 --> 01:34:20.401
By now I'd be two rows down...

01:34:20.560 --> 01:34:21.800
half a bag full.

01:34:22.240 --> 01:34:24.971
I'd be headed to the barn...

01:34:25.200 --> 01:34:26.964
gettin' ready to feed the stock.

01:34:27.200 --> 01:34:29.248
I'd be boiling water in the smokehouse,

01:34:29.360 --> 01:34:31.283
thinkin' 'bout dumping on massa's head.

01:34:32.880 --> 01:34:34.928
I'd be tying the barrels, sealin' cracks.

01:34:35.080 --> 01:34:37.160
Checkin' the leaves and straw.

01:34:37.240 --> 01:34:39.607
Packin' and stackin' 'em up.

01:34:40.440 --> 01:34:43.444
Dodgin' that cracker's lash.

01:34:46.120 --> 01:34:47.770
Not today.

01:34:47.960 --> 01:34:49.769
No, sir.

01:34:49.960 --> 01:34:52.281
Not today.

01:34:56.560 --> 01:34:58.449
On to Jerusalem?

01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:00.286
On to Jerusalem.

01:35:00.440 --> 01:35:01.805
On to Jerusalem!

01:35:25.400 --> 01:35:27.050
All right, this is how this is gonna work.

01:35:29.040 --> 01:35:33.246
You're gonna throw the weapons to the
ground, then you're gonna lie down.

01:35:35.800 --> 01:35:37.320
Do it.

01:35:37.400 --> 01:35:42.486
The Lord is our light and our salvation.

01:35:43.320 --> 01:35:44.651
Of whom we shall fear?

01:35:46.280 --> 01:35:48.169
Throw your weapons to the ground!

01:35:48.320 --> 01:35:51.324
The Lord is the strength of our lives.

01:35:51.480 --> 01:35:53.767
Of whom shall we be afraid?

01:35:56.320 --> 01:35:58.920
When the wicked, even our enemies

01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:00.240
and our foes came upon us...

01:36:00.480 --> 01:36:02.960
to eat up our flesh,
they stumbled and fell!

01:36:03.160 --> 01:36:04.446
Goddamn, niggers.

01:36:04.640 --> 01:36:08.080
Though a host shall encamp
against us, our hearts will not fear!

01:36:08.160 --> 01:36:09.207
Ready!

01:36:09.320 --> 01:36:11.811
Though war shall rise against us,
in this we will be confident!

01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:13.525
Aim!

01:36:16.640 --> 01:36:18.120
Rebel!

01:37:44.440 --> 01:37:45.930
Come on!

01:37:59.200 --> 01:38:01.089
Get down!

01:38:36.960 --> 01:38:38.166
Will!

01:38:57.520 --> 01:38:59.363
Get back!

01:39:10.520 --> 01:39:12.522
I'm all right.

01:39:44.640 --> 01:39:46.483
Southern trees

01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:55.083
Bearing strange fruit

01:39:59.240 --> 01:40:01.481
Blood on the leaves

01:40:06.040 --> 01:40:08.691
And blood at the root

01:40:13.240 --> 01:40:19.282
Black bodies swinging
in the southern breeze

01:40:26.400 --> 01:40:30.121
Strange fruit hanging

01:40:32.440 --> 01:40:34.602
From the poplar trees

01:40:39.800 --> 01:40:41.928
Pastoral scene

01:40:43.800 --> 01:40:47.805
Of the gallant south

01:40:52.280 --> 01:40:55.762
Them big, bulging eyes

01:40:57.120 --> 01:41:00.442
And the twisted mouth

01:41:05.280 --> 01:41:08.921
Scent of magnolia

01:41:09.800 --> 01:41:13.486
Clean and fresh

01:41:18.600 --> 01:41:20.841
Here is a fruit

01:41:43.320 --> 01:41:44.845
Cherry.

01:41:50.280 --> 01:41:51.280
It's Nat, love.

01:41:53.680 --> 01:41:55.682
Keep on workin'.

01:42:01.680 --> 01:42:03.728
They lookin' for you.

01:42:07.640 --> 01:42:09.324
They hurt you?

01:42:10.320 --> 01:42:12.322
No.

01:42:13.840 --> 01:42:15.729
How's Joanna?

01:42:17.160 --> 01:42:19.367
She fine.

01:42:20.560 --> 01:42:21.891
Momma?

01:42:22.120 --> 01:42:24.361
She fine, too.

01:42:27.320 --> 01:42:28.890
Keep on workin' now.

01:42:30.200 --> 01:42:32.089
Any word on the other men?

01:42:32.320 --> 01:42:34.243
They been hanged.

01:42:34.880 --> 01:42:36.564
All of them.

01:42:39.560 --> 01:42:41.244
They killin' people everywhere

01:42:41.360 --> 01:42:44.170
for no reason at all but being black.

01:42:47.160 --> 01:42:50.767
They say the killin' won't stop...

01:42:50.920 --> 01:42:53.366
'till they get you.

01:43:00.920 --> 01:43:02.763
All these months...

01:43:05.400 --> 01:43:07.402
I thought...

01:43:12.400 --> 01:43:14.767
I thought you were dead, too.

01:43:17.760 --> 01:43:19.762
I'm here, love.

01:43:20.960 --> 01:43:22.803
I'll always be.

01:43:28.920 --> 01:43:31.810
I miss you so much.

01:43:38.200 --> 01:43:39.964
Cherry?

01:43:40.800 --> 01:43:42.802
Who you talkin' to?

01:43:45.640 --> 01:43:48.450
I's just talkin' to myself.

01:43:52.160 --> 01:43:54.640
Wishin' things was different.

01:44:39.840 --> 01:44:41.490
Hey!

01:44:46.800 --> 01:44:48.882
That's him right there!

01:44:49.120 --> 01:44:50.960
Kill that nigger!

01:44:56.560 --> 01:44:59.564
I know you're angry. Trust me, I am too.

01:44:59.800 --> 01:45:04.010
This boy committed mass murder
and will hang for all to see.

01:45:04.200 --> 01:45:05.884
Get him up.

01:46:35.120 --> 01:46:36.281
Go to Hell!

01:46:38.120 --> 01:46:39.963
Animal!

01:47:05.520 --> 01:47:07.090
Hang him!

01:47:21.000 --> 01:47:22.525
Is there something you wanna say

01:47:22.640 --> 01:47:24.449
to these good people?

01:47:32.520 --> 01:47:34.443
I'm ready.
