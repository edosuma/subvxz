Subtitles by explosiveskull

00:52.383 --> 00:53.484
I saw you.

00:53.486 --> 00:54.818
You mean you were
spying on me.

00:54.820 --> 00:56.856
No. I was just passing.

00:57.489 --> 01:00.260
Sarah, I work on the opposite side of town.
How were you just passing?

01:00.526 --> 01:01.895
Why can't you just
tell me the truth?

01:02.328 --> 01:03.696
The truth? Okay.

01:04.396 --> 01:06.329
Are you sure?
Yes. No. Erm...

01:06.331 --> 01:07.399
I've met someone.

01:09.700 --> 01:12.269
Someone? I thought
I was your someone.

01:12.271 --> 01:14.772
Listen, I just need some
space, think about things.

01:14.774 --> 01:15.942
But we've only
just moved in.

01:16.475 --> 01:18.476
Look, I'll come
and collect my stuff

01:18.478 --> 01:19.744
when you've
calmed down.

01:19.746 --> 01:22.912
Calm? Oh, I am
perfectly calm.

01:22.914 --> 01:23.980
See?

01:29.922 --> 01:30.956
Oh!

02:20.038 --> 02:22.440
Bless you.

03:14.560 --> 03:16.059
There you are, darling.

04:12.751 --> 04:15.018
...this body who died...

04:30.568 --> 04:31.703
Are you all right?

04:34.672 --> 04:36.773
Yes, thanks.

04:39.611 --> 04:41.110
I should
think she's, you know, 20...

04:41.112 --> 04:42.179
Yes.

04:42.181 --> 04:43.750
It's getting a bit hot.

04:44.982 --> 04:46.518
So young,
wonderful.

04:47.585 --> 04:49.487
This is delicious cake.

04:49.489 --> 04:50.455
Looks it, too.

04:52.023 --> 04:53.825
I think she's
probably 33.

04:58.729 --> 05:00.965
Where on Earth have you been?
Sorry.

05:00.967 --> 05:02.967
You missed the service.

05:02.969 --> 05:05.069
Granny's friend Duncan
had to do your reading.

05:05.071 --> 05:08.172
He'd forgotten his glasses, so
none of it made any sense at all.

05:08.174 --> 05:10.040
Oh, I am so sorry.

05:10.042 --> 05:11.509
Hi.

05:11.511 --> 05:12.477
Sarah.

05:13.578 --> 05:14.413
Have you got
your dress on back to front?

05:14.980 --> 05:16.648
Er. Yeah. It's very now.

05:18.083 --> 05:19.749
Come and make yourself useful.

05:19.751 --> 05:21.718
This lot are inhaling the tea.

05:21.720 --> 05:24.287
Ugh! What's that doing here?
It looks ridiculous.

05:24.289 --> 05:27.824
Oh... It was on Granny's
list of wishes.

05:27.826 --> 05:29.059
Hmm.

05:29.061 --> 05:30.696
At least he was on time.

05:31.729 --> 05:33.129
Can you tell me
where the loo is?

05:33.131 --> 05:34.198
Yes, of course, dear.

05:34.200 --> 05:35.168
Bonkers.

05:37.736 --> 05:39.105
Dad.

05:40.205 --> 05:41.207
Pudding.

05:43.876 --> 05:45.977
Are you okay?
Yes, darling.

05:51.616 --> 05:54.018
To infinity and beyond.
Auntie Sarah!

05:55.121 --> 05:57.220
No, the loo's not
that way.

05:57.222 --> 05:58.590
Oh, this is where
you're all hiding.

05:59.792 --> 06:02.992
Should we really be watching
telly, today of all days?

06:02.994 --> 06:05.261
Come on, Caroline. It's so
boring for them out there.

06:05.263 --> 06:06.896
Anyway, it's nice
for their single auntie

06:06.898 --> 06:08.467
to have an armful
of niece and nephew.

06:08.799 --> 06:11.035
Mummy said to Daddy that
when you're really old,

06:11.037 --> 06:12.636
you'll be all on your own.

06:12.638 --> 06:13.940
Erm, Zachary, would you
mind just coming...

06:15.140 --> 06:17.006
And when you die, all they'll
find will be your skeleton

06:17.008 --> 06:19.109
and lots and lots of
really fat cats.

06:30.789 --> 06:33.225
May I have
your attention, please?

06:34.258 --> 06:37.360
Although my mother left
a formal will,

06:37.362 --> 06:41.766
she also wanted me to read out
a list of her personal wishes.

06:42.301 --> 06:44.867
She would like the following
people to go to her home

06:44.869 --> 06:48.004
and to choose an item
to remind them of her.

06:48.006 --> 06:49.939
Oh! Here goes.

06:49.941 --> 06:52.109
Archibald, my accountant.
Oh.

06:52.111 --> 06:53.744
Angela...

06:53.746 --> 06:56.146
Couldn't your chap
get the day off work?

06:56.148 --> 06:58.885
Ah. My chap
and I are no more.

06:59.650 --> 07:03.319
Oh, Sarah.
Not another one.

07:03.321 --> 07:05.222
What are we going
to do with you?

07:05.224 --> 07:07.159
You know me,
love 'em and leave 'em.

07:08.092 --> 07:11.864
Well, it's probably for the best.
I wasn't very taken.

07:13.599 --> 07:15.698
I wish people would say
something at the time

07:15.700 --> 07:17.800
rather than waiting
till the person's gone.

07:17.802 --> 07:19.636
Well, I didn't want
to interfere.

07:19.638 --> 07:20.605
Hmm, that's a first.

07:22.941 --> 07:25.042
Oh. Er, by the way,
I got that job.

07:25.044 --> 07:27.313
I start next term.
Head of year 11 English.

07:28.145 --> 07:29.782
Daneman Comprehensive.

07:31.049 --> 07:33.783
Such a shame you dropped
out of law school

07:33.785 --> 07:35.220
to go to teacher training.

07:36.153 --> 07:39.657
Now your sister's a barrister.
And a wife and a mother.

07:39.659 --> 07:41.158
Don't we just know it?

07:41.160 --> 07:42.359
And you...

07:42.361 --> 07:44.196
Got all the good looks?
Hmm.

08:09.888 --> 08:11.888
That blasted dog.

08:11.890 --> 08:14.092
Rupert,
my hairdresser's friend.

08:16.927 --> 08:18.028
Stop that.

08:18.030 --> 08:19.231
Oh, my goodness.

08:29.275 --> 08:34.376
And finally, um, to Sarah, I leave
my most treasured possession...

08:34.379 --> 08:38.414
Oh, Granfoos, how lovely. She always
knew I loved that Faberge brooch.

08:38.417 --> 08:40.219
My beloved Patrick.

08:40.885 --> 08:41.984
What?

08:43.054 --> 08:44.288
Are you sure?
Yes. Yes.

08:44.290 --> 08:46.356
She's bequeathed you Patrick,

08:46.358 --> 08:47.458
Patrick, her pug.

08:47.460 --> 08:49.425
How sweet.
No. No.

08:49.427 --> 08:52.463
She's added, "They'll be very
good for each other." Absolutely.

08:52.465 --> 08:55.131
- I don't know about you lot, but I rather
fancy a whisky. - No, we won't.

08:55.133 --> 08:57.333
We're a match
made in hell. Dad.

08:57.335 --> 08:58.937
Dad?

09:06.677 --> 09:08.178
No, no, no, no. Other full lock.
Other way.

09:08.180 --> 09:10.747
That's it. That's it.
That's it.

09:10.749 --> 09:12.915
Come on back now. That's right.
Come on back.

09:12.917 --> 09:14.852
Excellent. Jolly good.
And stop.

09:14.854 --> 09:16.386
All right. I know what I'm doing.
No, no, stop.

09:16.388 --> 09:17.889
Stop! Stop! Just...

09:19.925 --> 09:21.160
What was she thinking?

09:22.960 --> 09:24.060
Can we have him?

09:24.062 --> 09:25.328
No.
Yes.

09:25.330 --> 09:27.131
Why not?
Your mother's allergic.

09:27.133 --> 09:29.500
Yeah, if we ever did get a dog,
it would have to be a cockapoo.

09:29.502 --> 09:31.367
Can we get one of them, then?
No.

09:31.369 --> 09:32.404
Why not?

09:33.939 --> 09:36.439
Because I have too much to do, and
it'd be one more thing to worry about.

09:36.441 --> 09:37.875
Complain about.
What?

09:37.877 --> 09:39.242
Nothing.
Can't you have him?

09:39.244 --> 09:41.078
Oh. No, darling, no.

09:41.080 --> 09:43.081
Poor Snowy's
gonna take weeks to recover.

09:43.849 --> 09:46.018
If we ever find him.
Hmm.

09:46.283 --> 09:47.483
Please?

09:47.485 --> 09:49.054
I'm sorry,
pudding.

09:50.388 --> 09:53.423
What was Granny thinking?
She knows I live in a flat.

09:53.425 --> 09:56.359
And, might I just add,
the lease says "no pets."

09:56.361 --> 09:58.161
The landlord would go ape.

09:58.163 --> 10:00.863
And I start a new job in a week.
I'm gonna be out all day.

10:00.865 --> 10:04.034
And... And I don't like dogs.

10:04.036 --> 10:05.535
I don't want a dog.

10:05.537 --> 10:06.906
Can't one of you take him?

10:09.206 --> 10:10.475
Oh, brilliant.

10:13.077 --> 10:14.212
What?

10:14.879 --> 10:17.782
Stop it.

10:19.084 --> 10:21.821
Stop looking at me, okay?
It wasn't my idea.

10:25.056 --> 10:26.057
Bye.
Bye.

10:26.992 --> 10:27.727
Come on,
little ones. Time to go.

10:28.527 --> 10:29.161
Drive safely, darling.

10:39.271 --> 10:41.140
Okay, you're really
freaking me out now.

10:43.776 --> 10:44.910
Can't you look out the
window? It's nice.

10:45.543 --> 10:46.177
There's a castle
and everything.

10:54.518 --> 10:56.920
Slow-cooked rabbit ragout?

10:56.922 --> 10:58.622
£3.99?

10:58.624 --> 11:01.024
People are so gullible.
I bet it's all the same stuff.

11:04.361 --> 11:05.396
Put it back.

11:08.633 --> 11:10.034
Show me where you got it from.

11:12.537 --> 11:14.570
Oh. Hang on.
Sorry. That's not mine.

11:14.572 --> 11:16.506
Don't know how that got in there.

11:16.508 --> 11:20.343
I suspect a little person
with an adorable squashed face

11:20.345 --> 11:22.981
put it in there so Mummy'd
have some treats for later.

11:24.582 --> 11:28.920
Well, he can have some of Mummy's not
inconsiderable supply of chocolate instead.

11:29.321 --> 11:31.320
Don't you know chocolate's
poisonous for them?

11:31.322 --> 11:33.958
Really? Oh, well.
All the more for Mummy.

11:46.403 --> 11:47.539
Okay, you're freaking me out now.
Is it my driving or is...

11:48.473 --> 11:49.909
Oh.

11:51.243 --> 11:52.244
Stop.

11:55.446 --> 11:57.981
Okay, don't draw
attention to yourself.

12:05.123 --> 12:06.124
Hi.

12:07.325 --> 12:09.159
Rent's due Thursday.

12:09.161 --> 12:10.162
Have a nice evening.

12:18.869 --> 12:21.405
Right, first thing, we're getting
out of this ridiculous outfit.

12:21.407 --> 12:24.942
Secondly, I'm putting you up for grabs
on Facebook and possibly Tinder.

12:24.944 --> 12:27.079
I mean, God help us if any
of the neighbors catch us.

12:28.213 --> 12:29.545
I mean it, Patrick.

12:29.547 --> 12:32.181
One grunt, growl or bark
in the wrong place

12:32.183 --> 12:35.051
and we'll both be in Richmond
Park eating rabbit ragout.

12:35.053 --> 12:37.120
I know that sounds nice,
but it won't be.

13:01.580 --> 13:02.746
Patrick.

13:05.350 --> 13:07.117
It's 6:00 in the morning.

13:22.667 --> 13:23.668
Right.

13:27.404 --> 13:28.539
Here we go.

13:29.673 --> 13:31.442
Go on. Enjoy.

13:35.013 --> 13:36.282
Come on. I thought
you were desperate.

13:40.051 --> 13:41.287
Now you're making me
want to go.

13:52.230 --> 13:54.032
Oh, my God! Erm...
What are you doing here?

13:54.699 --> 13:56.702
Oh, I'm sorry.
I wasn't expecting company.

13:58.335 --> 13:59.803
Ah. Another law-breaker,
I see.

14:00.672 --> 14:04.042
Well, you have to keep an eye out. You
never know who might turn you in.

14:06.277 --> 14:07.376
Name?

14:07.378 --> 14:09.212
Sarah Jessica
Rosemary Francis.

14:09.214 --> 14:10.347
No, your dog.

14:10.349 --> 14:11.814
Oh, Patrick.

14:11.816 --> 14:12.783
He's not really my dog.

14:13.551 --> 14:15.718
My grandmother left him to me.

14:15.720 --> 14:17.054
I really need
to find him a home.

14:17.056 --> 14:18.387
You can't do that.
He's a bequest.

14:18.389 --> 14:21.357
You can't just pack him off
to the first bidder.

14:21.359 --> 14:23.293
I'm a teacher. I mean,
I can't take him with me.

14:23.295 --> 14:24.660
And I can't leave
him here on his own.

14:24.662 --> 14:26.396
Well, I'm sure
you'll find a way.

14:26.398 --> 14:27.664
Thanks.

14:27.666 --> 14:28.734
What a good girl.

14:31.235 --> 14:33.037
You haven't been here long.

14:33.604 --> 14:34.605
Just moved in.

14:36.306 --> 14:37.406
Here.

14:37.408 --> 14:39.508
Oh. No, thanks.
Not for you.

14:39.510 --> 14:43.246
It's for the dog. You've got
to pick up Patrick's poo.

14:43.248 --> 14:44.647
Yes, right.

14:44.649 --> 14:45.748
I'm Celia,

14:45.750 --> 14:47.151
and this is Wendy.

14:50.088 --> 14:52.088
Erm. We'd better be off.

14:52.090 --> 14:53.323
Yep. See you around.

14:53.325 --> 14:54.660
Or not. Wink, wink.

14:58.763 --> 15:02.066
Patrick,
that's gross.

15:09.575 --> 15:11.176
I knew this was a bad idea.

15:12.710 --> 15:15.280
I told them. I told them it wouldn't
work, but would they listen to me?

15:18.850 --> 15:21.650
Honestly, one more thing and you're
off to the pound. I have had it.

15:21.652 --> 15:23.489
Ew! Oh...

15:25.123 --> 15:27.357
Oh...

15:27.359 --> 15:29.228
Oh, that is disgusting.

15:30.228 --> 15:32.161
What is the matter with you?

15:32.163 --> 15:33.829
I mean, it's all food.

15:33.831 --> 15:35.564
If you were hungry,
you would eat it.

15:35.566 --> 15:36.867
I can't be doing...

15:36.869 --> 15:38.170
Ugh!

15:53.585 --> 15:54.585
Patrick.

15:58.590 --> 16:01.591
Patrick? Patrick?

16:05.797 --> 16:07.132
Patrick!

16:07.499 --> 16:09.234
I've just changed that bed.

16:10.869 --> 16:13.336
No. No.

16:13.338 --> 16:15.639
I know Granny
used to spoil you rotten.

16:15.641 --> 16:18.341
But while you're here,
you're under a new regime.

16:18.343 --> 16:20.546
The fridge is out of bounds.

16:21.178 --> 16:22.344
Not that I'm known
for taking them,

16:22.346 --> 16:25.448
but a walk in the park
may sharpen the old appetite.

16:49.507 --> 16:51.443
With any luck, you'll
wear yourself out.

17:09.627 --> 17:10.627
Patrick, heel.

17:12.296 --> 17:13.494
Patrick.

17:13.497 --> 17:15.365
Heel. Heel.

17:16.568 --> 17:17.536
Patrick.

17:19.338 --> 17:20.403
Patrick.

17:20.405 --> 17:21.440
Get that thing under control.

17:22.373 --> 17:22.874
- Sorry. Patrick.
- What are you doing?

17:24.309 --> 17:25.344
Patrick.

17:26.476 --> 17:27.478
Patrick. Come here.

17:28.646 --> 17:31.416
Patrick, I mean it. I mean it, Patrick.
Come here.

17:33.784 --> 17:35.620
Oh, God. Patrick!

17:38.590 --> 17:39.824
Come. Good boy.

17:41.859 --> 17:47.166
Okay. Stay. Good boy.
Stay. Good boy.

17:49.701 --> 17:50.769
Stop!

17:52.236 --> 17:53.839
Oh, no!

18:06.317 --> 18:09.685
Why, Grandma? Why?

18:11.523 --> 18:12.624
I came to see you
whenever I could.

18:14.024 --> 18:16.526
I never interrupted, even though
I'd heard your stories 20 times.

18:16.528 --> 18:17.596
What did I do wrong?

18:40.051 --> 18:41.550
Yours by any chance?

18:41.552 --> 18:44.020
Sort of. Oh, wretched dog.

18:44.022 --> 18:46.388
Thanks for catching him.
That's okay.

18:46.390 --> 18:47.926
Oh, God. What a disaster.

18:48.626 --> 18:50.359
I've been landed
with my grandmother's pug.

18:50.361 --> 18:52.462
I don't even want a dog.
I hate dogs.

18:52.464 --> 18:53.730
You don't hate dogs.

18:53.732 --> 18:56.031
No. Maybe I just
hate this one.

18:57.502 --> 18:58.803
How long have
you got him for?

19:00.038 --> 19:01.937
Er, I don't know. He's nine and
in annoyingly good health.

19:01.939 --> 19:04.674
Maybe five years, then,
if you're lucky.

19:04.676 --> 19:06.809
Five years?

19:06.811 --> 19:08.011
I'd get less for
armed robbery.

19:08.013 --> 19:10.012
Oh, it's just
teething problems.

19:10.014 --> 19:11.714
You just need to
get to know each other,

19:11.716 --> 19:13.782
form an understanding.
It's like any relationship.

19:13.784 --> 19:14.820
Really?

19:15.887 --> 19:16.455
He'll be expecting me
to pick up his underpants

19:17.254 --> 19:17.822
in a few weeks' time.

19:18.889 --> 19:20.723
Well, you'll get to trust
each other and, well,

19:20.725 --> 19:22.628
you'll wonder how you
ever lived without him.

19:23.561 --> 19:26.529
You and I have very different
relationship experiences.

19:26.531 --> 19:28.030
But I could give it a go.

19:28.032 --> 19:29.366
Don't give up on
him too easily.

19:30.735 --> 19:31.869
He's quite a cute
little fella, really.

19:33.404 --> 19:34.406
Ooh.

19:35.407 --> 19:37.440
Can I give you a hand
back to the car park?

19:37.442 --> 19:39.344
Thank you. I might
give it a minute or two.

19:39.711 --> 19:42.514
In case the other walkers stone
me before I get back to the car.

19:43.648 --> 19:45.682
Keep him on the lead
for the time being.

19:45.684 --> 19:47.884
He's a man. He responds
to clear instruction.

19:47.886 --> 19:49.985
Oh. I will. Thank you.

19:49.987 --> 19:51.489
Well, see you around?

19:51.888 --> 19:52.890
Yeah.

20:05.436 --> 20:08.372
Most dogs bring back a rabbit.
Well done, Patrick.

20:15.545 --> 20:18.481
"In a few weeks' time, he'll be expecting
me to pick up his underpants."

20:36.635 --> 20:37.700
No, Patrick.

20:38.869 --> 20:40.669
Not on the furniture, okay?

20:40.671 --> 20:41.872
It's part of
the new regime.

20:44.208 --> 20:45.509
First day of school tomorrow.

20:46.944 --> 20:49.878
I want you to stay here and entertain
yourself until I get back, okay?

20:49.880 --> 20:51.649
And wish me luck.

20:55.520 --> 20:56.754
Oh.

20:57.554 --> 20:58.821
Thanks for the support.

21:11.569 --> 21:13.101
No.

21:13.103 --> 21:14.236
No, no, no, no.

21:14.238 --> 21:16.039
No, no, no, no, no.

21:16.041 --> 21:17.376
My first day and I'm late.

21:18.208 --> 21:19.709
Ooh.

21:20.811 --> 21:22.811
Okay, I'm coming,
but be quick.

21:29.920 --> 21:31.155
Oh!

21:32.857 --> 21:34.156
Patrick, what
have you eaten?

21:34.158 --> 21:35.892
Oh, God.

21:35.894 --> 21:37.793
Oh, that is disgusting.

21:39.664 --> 21:40.896
Oh, God. Oh, God.

21:43.801 --> 21:45.936
Well, glad it's
coming out of both ends.

21:47.938 --> 21:49.571
No. No.

21:49.573 --> 21:51.174
No, no, Patrick.

21:52.711 --> 21:53.712
Oh, no.

21:56.513 --> 21:57.748
Patrick.

21:58.949 --> 22:00.716
Patrick, that's it. Come here.
Come on. Come along.

22:00.718 --> 22:03.185
Come on. Good boy.
Patrick, come on.

22:03.187 --> 22:04.422
Good boy.
Come on. Patrick.

22:04.988 --> 22:06.725
Patrick. Patrick.

22:07.657 --> 22:09.791
Good boy. Yeah,
good boy. Come on.

22:09.793 --> 22:11.694
What's this? Come on.
Come on, Patrick.

22:11.696 --> 22:13.562
Yes, yes, yes,
yes, yes.

22:13.564 --> 22:14.765
Come on.

22:18.269 --> 22:19.601
Patrick!

22:19.603 --> 22:21.705
Patrick, get here right now.

22:29.914 --> 22:33.750
Patrick, I am
really very angry!

22:35.020 --> 22:37.252
And if you don't
get here right now,

22:37.254 --> 22:39.690
I am gonna lose my job
on my first day...

22:41.926 --> 22:45.595
And I'm gonna have to live in a
cardboard box under a bridge

22:45.597 --> 22:47.996
and no one's ever
gonna love me,

22:47.998 --> 22:50.934
and my life is gonna be over.

22:57.641 --> 22:58.743
Gotcha.

23:01.878 --> 23:04.347
Now, I'll be back
at 4: 30.

23:04.349 --> 23:05.850
Please don't touch anything
while I'm gone.

23:06.684 --> 23:07.719
And run.

23:35.879 --> 23:37.282
Sorry, excuse me.

23:46.023 --> 23:48.193
Excuse me, off. Off, please.

23:54.764 --> 23:56.165
Good morning!

24:00.170 --> 24:01.171
Okay.

24:06.077 --> 24:09.147
Always works. Good morning.
Please take your seats.

24:10.113 --> 24:12.616
I'm Miss Francis,
your new English teacher.

24:14.084 --> 24:17.087
Okay. If you could just introduce
yourselves to me, please.

24:19.323 --> 24:20.958
Okay. And how do you
spell that?

24:25.996 --> 24:28.364
She was all I could get
at such short notice.

24:28.366 --> 24:32.234
Well, I'm betting you'll have
disciplinary problems with Miss Francis.

24:33.705 --> 24:36.271
Oh. Ah! Well, welcome.

24:36.273 --> 24:37.242
Thank you.

24:38.243 --> 24:41.109
Hi. Don't think we've met.
I'm Sarah Francis.

24:41.111 --> 24:42.147
I major in discipline.

24:45.081 --> 24:47.752
Okay, right. Well,
I'll catch you later.

24:49.352 --> 24:52.256
Big mistake. Huge mistake.

25:38.769 --> 25:40.736
Hi. You must be Sarah,
the new girl.

25:40.738 --> 25:42.305
Hi. Yeah.
I'm Becky. Come on.

25:42.307 --> 25:43.775
Don't let this lot
put you off.

25:46.042 --> 25:47.212
If you'll excuse me.

25:47.911 --> 25:50.445
Don't mind old Peters.
He doesn't like change.

25:50.447 --> 25:52.115
Or English teachers.
Or blondes.

25:52.117 --> 25:53.515
Budge up, Maureen.
This is Sarah.

25:53.517 --> 25:55.786
Hello. She teaches
year 11 English.

25:56.352 --> 25:57.453
Would you like
a rock cake?

25:57.455 --> 25:58.423
Oh. Thanks.

25:59.223 --> 26:00.956
Your class made those.
Ah.

26:00.958 --> 26:02.892
Yep. Clue's in the name.

26:02.894 --> 26:04.329
Let's hope their English
is a bit better.

26:05.295 --> 26:07.032
I bet you're wondering
what I teach.

26:07.732 --> 26:09.765
Ah. Let me guess. Economics?

26:09.767 --> 26:11.399
Close. I'm one of
the games teachers.

26:11.401 --> 26:13.001
Thought so.
It's all the Lycra.

26:13.003 --> 26:15.104
And I'm organizing
a fun run for charity.

26:15.106 --> 26:16.873
Oh?
And I was wondering

26:16.875 --> 26:19.244
if maybe you could persuade
your class to run?

26:20.343 --> 26:21.543
And how would I do that?

26:21.545 --> 26:22.813
By entering yourself.

26:23.313 --> 26:24.715
Oh.

26:25.949 --> 26:27.418
Oh, I'm really sorry. I'm not
a runner, never have been.

26:29.119 --> 26:31.222
I'm the same with swimming. I do all the
right actions, I just don't go anywhere.

26:31.921 --> 26:35.157
Anyway, just had huge difficulty
trying to persuade my class

26:35.159 --> 26:37.260
to read page one
of <i>Jane Eyre,</i> so,

26:37.262 --> 26:39.162
I don't fancy my chances
with a fun run.

26:39.164 --> 26:40.432
It's only five kilometers.

26:41.765 --> 26:43.965
That's miles. I mean,
that's practically a marathon.

26:43.967 --> 26:45.003
No, it's not.

26:46.337 --> 26:48.303
You go through the park, up the
hill and then back into school.

26:48.305 --> 26:50.174
So... Did you just say
up the hill?

26:51.909 --> 26:54.577
I hope you know that when people say no to
me, I treat that as start of negotiations.

26:54.579 --> 26:56.347
Well, I think you've
met your match here.

26:59.949 --> 27:01.283
Oh.

27:01.285 --> 27:02.918
Oh. Doesn't matter.

27:02.920 --> 27:04.020
Yeah, sorry. Thanks.

27:04.022 --> 27:06.222
It's all right. I'll find
someone with good teeth.

27:06.224 --> 27:07.725
Yeah.

27:10.226 --> 27:11.396
Would you
like another cake?

28:00.077 --> 28:01.412
Darling, I'm home.

28:06.350 --> 28:07.417
Oh, no.

28:27.404 --> 28:31.273
You, mate,
are ruining my life.

28:31.275 --> 28:34.845
It was hard enough without you,
but with you, it's impossible.

28:41.318 --> 28:42.487
Well, you can't
do that again.

28:43.520 --> 28:45.123
Do come in.

28:46.491 --> 28:48.526
Every time a stray animal wandered
by, he screamed the place down.

28:49.426 --> 28:51.394
I fear there's
going to be a letter.

28:51.396 --> 28:53.495
Can I get you a tea?

28:53.497 --> 28:56.398
No. And I suggest
you take him for a walk.

28:56.400 --> 28:58.367
That's what you do when
you leave a dog all day.

28:58.369 --> 28:59.971
Yeah, of course.
I was just about to.

29:01.405 --> 29:04.975
Look, I will get something sorted,
but could you have him tomorrow?

29:05.408 --> 29:06.541
No.
Just for tomorrow.

29:06.543 --> 29:08.577
No, he's so badly behaved.

29:08.579 --> 29:11.146
But he'd be so much
better with company.

29:11.148 --> 29:12.516
You'd be really
helping me out.

29:13.951 --> 29:17.252
Just see how it goes?
Please? Please.

29:17.254 --> 29:20.489
Well, just for tomorrow, but
you have to sort yourself out.

29:20.491 --> 29:23.291
Don't worry, I will. Thank you, Celia.
Thank you.

29:23.293 --> 29:24.995
I owe you.
Yes, you do.

29:28.398 --> 29:31.032
If you don't
behave tomorrow,

29:31.034 --> 29:33.071
you really are going
to the dog home.

29:40.477 --> 29:41.579
Coming.

29:43.313 --> 29:46.014
Hi. I'm really not
sure about this.

29:46.016 --> 29:47.616
Wendy and I lead
a very quiet life.

29:47.618 --> 29:50.353
Oh, it's just for today. And
Patrick is very well behaved.

29:50.355 --> 29:51.389
My granny was very strict.

29:52.455 --> 29:54.290
She was with us,
at least.

29:54.292 --> 29:56.157
I'll be back at 4:30.

29:56.159 --> 29:59.228
Now, say thank you and offer
to do the washing-up.

30:01.032 --> 30:02.263
Come on.

30:02.265 --> 30:04.265
Mummy's abandoning you.

30:04.267 --> 30:05.401
In you come.

30:07.271 --> 30:09.941
Jane Eyre,
the protagonist.

30:12.376 --> 30:14.946
Thank you.

30:15.646 --> 30:17.982
It's never the dog.
It's always the owner.

30:23.186 --> 30:24.653
There's a fight
over there.

30:24.655 --> 30:26.789
Oh. Oh. Get off. Stop it.

30:46.676 --> 30:48.212
You should be ashamed
of yourselves.

30:59.555 --> 31:00.691
Oh, no.

31:01.291 --> 31:04.227
What have you done?
Oh, my darling.

31:16.674 --> 31:18.540
<i>I always knew
you were a little strange</i>

31:18.542 --> 31:20.475
Never again.
Oh. I'm sorry.

31:20.477 --> 31:22.243
Here's his collar.
Right.

31:22.245 --> 31:23.680
Goodbye.
I'm really sorry.

31:42.232 --> 31:43.667
Hi.
Hi.

31:44.568 --> 31:45.570
Oh.
Oh.

31:46.403 --> 31:48.270
Sorry.
Sorry, no.

31:48.272 --> 31:50.505
Oh, God. Ooh, ha.

31:50.507 --> 31:51.639
Sorry.
Sorry.

31:51.641 --> 31:53.311
It's bound to be our fault.
Yeah.

31:54.645 --> 31:57.080
Be announcing our engagement soon.

31:57.848 --> 31:59.147
He's cute.

31:59.149 --> 32:01.119
Cute? Stick around.

32:01.752 --> 32:04.555
Can I just ask, when you got a
dog, what were you thinking?

32:05.155 --> 32:08.326
I like 'em. Bit of companionship.
Keep myself fit.

32:09.392 --> 32:12.396
Moments like this.
Walking, contemplating.

32:13.129 --> 32:16.531
Yeah, so you never wanna grab it by the
throat and march it off to the pound?

32:16.533 --> 32:18.533
What's he destroyed?

32:18.535 --> 32:19.902
Oh. Erm, my life.

32:19.904 --> 32:21.239
Wow. Impressive.

32:21.737 --> 32:23.041
How long have you had him?

32:24.074 --> 32:25.342
Too long. It was a bequest
from my grandmother.

32:26.343 --> 32:27.044
I was hoping for the
microwave at least.

32:28.178 --> 32:29.580
Maybe she had her reasons
for leaving him with you.

32:30.947 --> 32:32.915
She was 92. I'm not sure reasoning
was her strong point.

32:32.917 --> 32:34.519
Well, I think you should
stick with it.

32:35.185 --> 32:36.220
Why?

32:37.955 --> 32:40.491
I dunno. How else would you get to play
Twister in a park with a complete stranger?

32:41.591 --> 32:43.725
Hmm.
I'm Ben, by the way.

32:43.727 --> 32:44.926
Oh, Sarah.
Hi.

32:44.928 --> 32:46.628
Er, this is Scout.

32:46.630 --> 32:47.695
<i>To Kill a Mockingbird.</i>

32:47.697 --> 32:49.399
Er. Precisely.

32:50.266 --> 32:51.268
Ah.

32:52.270 --> 32:54.439
Well, nice meeting you.
Nice to meet you, too.

32:55.339 --> 32:56.808
Come on, Scout. Come on.

33:02.311 --> 33:06.216
Hmm. I have to hand it to you,
you are quite the babe magnet.

33:17.927 --> 33:19.563
Oh, all right, come on.

33:20.731 --> 33:22.100
This is just for tonight,
though.

33:22.799 --> 33:25.703
Oh, Patrick, what am
I gonna do with you?

33:27.236 --> 33:30.440
Don't worry,
I'll think of something.

33:42.785 --> 33:44.455
Right, okay.

33:58.901 --> 34:00.670
Can I, er...
Can I help you?

34:00.937 --> 34:03.871
Hi. Er, I'm Sarah Francis,
the new English teacher.

34:03.873 --> 34:06.543
I was wondering if you and I
could come to an arrangement.

34:06.944 --> 34:08.212
What do you want?

34:08.811 --> 34:10.980
Could you take this dog?
Just for today.

34:10.982 --> 34:12.215
No.

34:13.482 --> 34:14.583
I'll give you £10.

34:16.252 --> 34:17.388
£40.
What?

34:18.455 --> 34:19.590
He's just gonna be
sitting in your room all day,

34:20.556 --> 34:21.359
and maybe you'd take him out
at lunchtime.

34:21.958 --> 34:22.726
That's £50.
What?

34:25.929 --> 34:27.231
Now it's £60.

34:29.967 --> 34:32.235
How about we
have a sleepover

34:33.002 --> 34:34.737
and a bit of shopping
after school?

34:35.973 --> 34:37.306
Yeah.

34:37.308 --> 34:39.243
It'll be okay.
Miss is here.

34:42.378 --> 34:43.681
You okay?
Yeah.

34:46.449 --> 34:47.616
Don't help me.

34:47.618 --> 34:49.786
It's erm,
it's Vikki, isn't it?

34:53.590 --> 34:55.523
I've only been here a week and
I feel like crying as well.

34:58.895 --> 35:00.561
Do you wanna
talk about it?

35:00.563 --> 35:01.732
No, you're all right.

35:05.935 --> 35:08.505
Bonding with the students already?
How modern.

35:10.406 --> 35:11.609
I saw that.

35:15.478 --> 35:17.214
I ask again,

35:18.683 --> 35:20.951
what is it about Mr. Rochester that
makes him so perfect for Jane Eyre?

35:21.485 --> 35:23.384
Why can't she get over him?

35:23.386 --> 35:24.652
His tight trousers?

35:29.360 --> 35:31.626
What is it with you guys? Why are you
determined not to focus on your set books?

35:31.628 --> 35:32.730
These are your GCSEs.

35:34.297 --> 35:35.299
It's boring.

35:35.931 --> 35:37.032
Right.

35:37.034 --> 35:38.236
That... No.
Oi.

35:39.337 --> 35:41.436
Miss, I was looking at
what Jane Eyre looked like.

35:41.438 --> 35:43.871
Charlotte hasn't
provided pictures.

35:43.873 --> 35:45.709
Right, okay, let's try this.

35:47.310 --> 35:50.780
Jane's parents bite the big one.
Dead, gone, okay?

35:51.447 --> 35:53.614
Jane is packed off
to live with her aunt,

35:53.616 --> 35:56.786
Mrs. Reed, in the country,
who is a right old bag.

35:57.554 --> 36:00.989
And then she pulls a blinder,
locks her in a room

36:00.991 --> 36:02.891
with her dead uncle's ghost.

36:02.893 --> 36:04.893
Ooh!

36:04.895 --> 36:06.594
Yeah.

36:06.596 --> 36:07.864
Come in.

36:13.536 --> 36:15.339
Here's your dog.

36:16.605 --> 36:19.074
Look, can we talk about
this at lunchtime?

36:19.076 --> 36:22.009
This little dog
ate my lunch.

36:22.011 --> 36:23.911
Ooh!

36:23.913 --> 36:26.047
I'll go out at break time
and I'll buy you a sandwich.

36:26.049 --> 36:29.985
And a packet of crisps
and a Snickers.

36:29.987 --> 36:31.119
A Snickers?

36:31.121 --> 36:32.989
That is just what I need.

36:33.357 --> 36:35.056
What's the matter, miss?

36:35.058 --> 36:37.492
Chocolate's
poisonous for dogs.

36:37.494 --> 36:39.427
Oh, be sick. Please be sick.

36:39.429 --> 36:41.462
Mikey, find the
nearest vet.

36:41.464 --> 36:43.998
Well, I was unblocking
the girls' toilets.

36:44.000 --> 36:45.768
The nearest vet's
on the main road, 425.

36:45.770 --> 36:47.405
Okay, phone them and tell
them what's happened.

36:48.739 --> 36:49.871
Yeah, yeah, miss, go now, quick.
Quick. It's gonna get sick.

36:49.873 --> 36:52.040
Look, we'll read chapter
one until the bell goes.

36:52.042 --> 36:53.108
Thank you, Vikki.

36:53.110 --> 36:55.476
Quick, quick, quick.
That's it.

37:00.650 --> 37:01.886
Pack it in, you lot.

37:03.886 --> 37:05.722
Do you wanna be a teacher?
Go on then, be a teacher.

37:06.522 --> 37:08.857
It's not good enough, Diana.
You must do better.

37:08.859 --> 37:11.058
You've known about this
for at least two weeks.

37:11.060 --> 37:13.661
Miss Francis, is that
a dog under your arm?

37:13.663 --> 37:15.063
Uh...

37:15.065 --> 37:16.367
Yes.

37:17.433 --> 37:18.967
As you well know, pets
are not allowed in school.

37:18.969 --> 37:20.971
May I ask where
you're taking this dog?

37:21.638 --> 37:23.105
Uh...

37:23.107 --> 37:25.643
To the biology lab
for an experiment.

37:26.543 --> 37:27.878
Run out of frogs,
have they?

37:28.511 --> 37:30.112
He's just
eaten a chocolate bar.

37:30.114 --> 37:31.779
I need to take him
to the vet's.

37:31.781 --> 37:32.850
And who, may I ask,

37:34.284 --> 37:36.518
is looking after your class while
you perform this important task?

37:36.520 --> 37:38.855
I've left Vikki Andrews
in charge. They're reading.

37:39.589 --> 37:41.190
Really?
Yes.

37:41.192 --> 37:43.458
Vikki is a very sensible
young woman.

37:46.096 --> 37:48.197
Sorry, what is the matter?

37:48.199 --> 37:49.797
Why have you
taken against me?

37:49.799 --> 37:51.065
I haven't
taken against you.

37:51.067 --> 37:52.069
Yes, you have.

37:53.270 --> 37:55.603
Ever since I first arrived,
you've been horrible to me.

37:55.605 --> 37:57.038
I mean, what have I done to you?

37:57.040 --> 37:58.739
Right, to be honest...

37:58.741 --> 38:00.175
Yes, be honest.

38:00.177 --> 38:04.079
Actually, not too honest,
but go ahead.

38:04.081 --> 38:06.248
I like a teacher who
can discipline a class,

38:06.250 --> 38:08.483
get them focused
and learning.

38:08.485 --> 38:10.518
Your type just wants
to be friends with them,

38:10.520 --> 38:12.887
and with that class, in this
school, that won't work.

38:12.889 --> 38:16.592
My type? You don't know anything
about me or my teaching methods.

38:16.594 --> 38:18.192
I suggest you go down
to my classroom right now

38:18.194 --> 38:21.929
and see just how responsible and
focused my students can be.

38:21.931 --> 38:25.266
Now, I'm going to the vet's.
I'll be back at lunchtime.

38:25.268 --> 38:26.534
Make sure you are.

38:26.536 --> 38:27.837
I just said I will be.

38:29.906 --> 38:31.072
Tosser.

38:31.074 --> 38:32.206
I heard that.

38:32.208 --> 38:33.576
You were meant to.

38:48.491 --> 38:49.493
Hmm...

38:58.302 --> 38:59.503
Two minutes.

39:00.804 --> 39:02.907
Now, remember, the record's
three minutes and five seconds.

39:13.750 --> 39:15.218
Okay. Thank you.

39:16.685 --> 39:18.087
Patrick Francis.

39:23.159 --> 39:24.527
Oh.

39:25.761 --> 39:27.864
Oh. I see. You call the dog's name.
Aw. That's cute. Um...

39:28.632 --> 39:30.299
Er, yeah,
Patrick Francis here.

39:30.301 --> 39:31.699
Come on through.

39:31.701 --> 39:32.837
How is the
little deer hunter?

39:34.205 --> 39:36.473
He's given that up now. He's now
the chocolate eater.

39:37.139 --> 39:38.607
You do know
that chocolate is...

39:38.609 --> 39:40.511
Poisonous, yeah.
It was a mistake.

39:41.877 --> 39:43.177
So how's it going?

39:43.179 --> 39:45.614
Er, in general
or with Patrick?

39:45.616 --> 39:46.984
Let's start with Patrick.

39:48.451 --> 39:51.786
Oh. Er... Well, he eats everything
except the food I put down for him.

39:51.788 --> 39:55.190
Erm... I'm running out of people
to watch him while I'm at work.

39:55.192 --> 39:57.960
And I'm expecting the
inevitable eviction notice

39:57.962 --> 39:59.860
from my flat
I've just moved into

39:59.862 --> 40:02.029
because they have
a strict "no pets" policy.

40:02.031 --> 40:03.533
Otherwise, great.

40:06.337 --> 40:09.804
Well, I don't think it's
enough to do him any harm.

40:09.806 --> 40:13.276
I could pump his stomach out, but I don't
think you'd thank me for it, would you?

40:14.710 --> 40:16.744
Just make sure
he has plenty of water.

40:16.746 --> 40:18.980
Thanks. Say thank you,
Patrick.

40:18.982 --> 40:20.616
Thank you.

40:20.618 --> 40:21.949
My pleasure.

40:21.951 --> 40:23.620
Okay.

40:25.054 --> 40:26.822
Hit me with the damage.

40:26.824 --> 40:28.058
He hasn't charged you.

40:29.225 --> 40:29.826
You've just gotta let him
know how Patrick's doing

40:30.793 --> 40:31.561
and when you've got
a night free for dinner.

40:32.628 --> 40:34.630
Oh. Right.

40:34.632 --> 40:36.197
Well, that's strange.

40:36.199 --> 40:37.866
It's not how I usually
do business.

40:37.868 --> 40:40.938
So do I pay for the meal?
Is that how this works?

40:42.038 --> 40:45.239
I don't know.
Okay. Um, bye.

40:45.241 --> 40:47.009
Okay. Bye. Bye.
Bye.

40:57.753 --> 40:59.186
Muffin Bigwood.

41:01.290 --> 41:02.891
- <i>That's cool.</i>
- <i>Yeah.</i>

41:02.893 --> 41:04.291
<i>And then he
put it on the computer</i>

41:04.293 --> 41:05.826
<i>and sent it through
to the girl on the desk.</i>

41:05.828 --> 41:07.695
Like something
out of a novel.

41:07.697 --> 41:10.032
Oh. There you go. Call me a
little bit old-fashioned,

41:10.034 --> 41:12.266
but isn't that
the tiniest bit creepy?

41:12.268 --> 41:14.168
Well, I always meet mine
off dating websites,

41:14.170 --> 41:16.005
so that seems
relatively sane to me.

41:17.040 --> 41:20.241
Ah. Miss Francis, how did
the trip to the vet go?

41:20.243 --> 41:22.076
Oh. Better than
expected, thanks.

41:26.281 --> 41:28.183
What are you ladies
finding so funny?

41:28.185 --> 41:29.152
Oh, nothing.

41:29.752 --> 41:30.753
Eclair?

41:31.087 --> 41:32.454
No, thank you, Maureen.

41:32.456 --> 41:34.322
John?
Oh. Thank you.

41:34.324 --> 41:35.956
Well done.

41:35.958 --> 41:37.458
By the way, Miss Francis,

41:37.460 --> 41:40.262
are you aware you are now
the only member of staff

41:40.264 --> 41:42.197
who is not taking part
in the fun run?

41:42.199 --> 41:43.167
What?

41:44.701 --> 41:47.034
I'm afraid Mrs. Phillips will take a
rather dim view of our newest teacher

41:47.036 --> 41:48.770
not partaking in
school activities.

41:48.772 --> 41:50.139
Er, well, that's
where you're wrong.

41:50.973 --> 41:53.076
Sarah signed up to the fun
run just this morning.

41:54.243 --> 41:56.713
Yes, she's running on behalf
of her favorite charity.

41:57.913 --> 42:00.149
Er... Er...
The Pug Rescue...

42:00.949 --> 42:02.386
Society.
Hmm.

42:03.052 --> 42:04.922
Oh. Well,
that's all right, then.

42:07.891 --> 42:10.761
What have you done?
I can't run five kilometers.

42:11.427 --> 42:14.829
I'm sorry. I just can't bear it
when he crows over us like that.

42:14.831 --> 42:16.032
Oh, this is awful.

42:17.000 --> 42:18.433
Are you doing it, Maureen?

42:18.435 --> 42:21.005
Er, I'm exempt.
How are you exempt?

42:22.906 --> 42:24.074
Asthma.

42:25.507 --> 42:29.210
Becky, why couldn't you have given
me some sort of fictional complaint?

42:29.212 --> 42:31.079
I'm sorry. It was the first
thing that came to my head.

42:32.148 --> 42:33.183
Will you have
another eclair?

42:34.116 --> 42:35.951
Yeah. Oh. I can't now.
I've gotta run 5K.

42:35.953 --> 42:37.451
Oh, go on. Go on.

42:37.453 --> 42:38.721
Heaven.

42:40.022 --> 42:42.491
Year 11 remedial's attempt at choux.
I think I'll have to.

42:42.493 --> 42:43.661
I shouldn't.

42:49.364 --> 42:50.898
Whoo. Here we go.

42:50.900 --> 42:51.902
I can't do this.

42:53.168 --> 42:55.436
I really can't do this. I faint
if I have to run for the bus.

42:55.438 --> 42:57.471
Well, I'm sorry, but I think
you're gonna have to.

43:03.913 --> 43:05.146
If I'm doing this...

43:07.049 --> 43:08.916
You're doing this too.

43:08.918 --> 43:10.154
Come on, Francis.

43:14.290 --> 43:18.259
Can't we go shopping? You like
shopping, don't you, Becky?

43:18.261 --> 43:19.561
Come on.
Oh, my God.

43:21.998 --> 43:24.933
Oi, Dobbin, can you slow down
for just a minute, please?

43:24.935 --> 43:25.969
No pain, no gain.

43:27.337 --> 43:29.404
I'm gonna kill you in a minute.
I'm just giving you fair warning.

43:29.406 --> 43:32.176
Ha. Trust me, you'll
thank me for it one day.

43:33.143 --> 43:36.945
A lot of words are coming to mind
and "thank" ain't one of 'em.

43:36.947 --> 43:39.483
- Oh, God.
- Oh...

43:52.996 --> 43:54.929
Morning, Sarah.

43:54.931 --> 43:56.032
Morning.

44:09.846 --> 44:12.313
So, Jane's getting
ready for her big day.

44:12.315 --> 44:14.516
She's got the dress,
the cake's booked,

44:14.518 --> 44:17.117
the bridesmaids are all
getting their fake tans.

44:19.255 --> 44:20.891
And then suddenly, some
bloke breaks up the party

44:22.092 --> 44:24.360
by announcing that Mr. Rochester
is already married.

44:27.364 --> 44:31.933
Plot twist. Turns out his wife is
locked up in the attic. Weird.

44:31.935 --> 44:35.503
So Mr. Rochester says, "Sorry,
we can't be husband and wife.

44:35.505 --> 44:40.141
"But how about you stay on as a
sort of unofficial Mrs. Rochester?"

44:40.143 --> 44:41.543
Like Spike's dad.

44:41.545 --> 44:42.913
Oh. Shut up.

44:44.214 --> 44:46.516
Jane loves him,
so what does she do?

44:48.051 --> 44:49.119
Vikki?

44:55.023 --> 44:58.795
Jane flees because she believes
in a sense of morality.

44:59.295 --> 45:01.128
You know,
he's taken his vows

45:01.130 --> 45:04.431
and even though
it would break her heart,

45:04.433 --> 45:06.102
she can't hook up
with a married guy.

45:07.302 --> 45:09.172
So why is marriage
so important to Jane?

45:10.172 --> 45:13.141
Why are her principles
more important than love?

45:13.143 --> 45:15.179
Why is marriage everything?

45:16.880 --> 45:19.950
Well, it's not, though, is it?
It doesn't bloody matter.

45:23.252 --> 45:24.353
Er...

45:25.355 --> 45:26.956
It's not your fault, miss.
I'll go fetch her.

45:30.226 --> 45:34.198
Okay. Erm... We'll just carry on.
Er, hands up.

45:38.368 --> 45:40.203
Patrick? Hand up?

46:00.556 --> 46:03.224
We're being evicted.
What?

46:03.226 --> 46:05.659
I think he's found out about Wendy.
I can't believe it.

46:05.661 --> 46:07.531
Oh... Oh, come in.

46:13.670 --> 46:15.172
I've nowhere to go.

46:16.572 --> 46:19.009
I've been here for years.
All my friends are here.

46:20.476 --> 46:21.912
What am I going to do?

46:24.514 --> 46:26.483
This is our fault.

46:27.282 --> 46:30.085
I'll tell the landlord that it's
Patrick who's the nuisance.

46:30.087 --> 46:32.188
Then you and Wendy
can go back to normal.

46:32.721 --> 46:34.556
Oh, thank you, Sarah.

46:34.558 --> 46:37.092
I'm having trouble
re-homing him anyway.

46:37.094 --> 46:39.329
No one wants an older dog,
including me.

46:41.264 --> 46:42.630
We'll find
somewhere else to live.

46:42.632 --> 46:43.634
Where will you go?

46:44.299 --> 46:46.034
Well, there's always
a park bench.

46:46.036 --> 46:48.302
Getting
quite fond of that park.

46:48.304 --> 46:49.272
Oh, no.

46:49.973 --> 46:50.974
Oh, I'm joking.

46:51.674 --> 46:52.676
Oh.

46:58.380 --> 46:59.917
- Come on.
- Hiya.

47:01.551 --> 47:02.784
Are you coming or going?

47:02.786 --> 47:04.351
Oh. Just going.

47:05.989 --> 47:07.023
Oh, no.

47:09.025 --> 47:10.027
Oh, God.

47:11.127 --> 47:12.128
Oh...

47:13.130 --> 47:15.764
God, if it can go wrong
with this dog, it will.

47:15.766 --> 47:17.599
Oh, I've got loads
of marking to do.

47:17.601 --> 47:18.568
Hold on.

47:19.368 --> 47:20.436
You...

47:24.574 --> 47:25.575
Ah.

47:26.542 --> 47:27.677
Oh.

47:34.784 --> 47:37.217
This is what you get
from a misspent youth.

47:39.221 --> 47:41.121
Sorry. It's...
I've... It's open.

47:41.123 --> 47:42.257
Ah. Thanks.

47:42.259 --> 47:43.659
Thank you.
No worries.

48:02.677 --> 48:04.545
Do you think this is
a bit too dressy?

48:04.547 --> 48:05.715
No, I think it really
suits you.

48:06.782 --> 48:09.583
I just don't wanna look
like I've tried too hard.

48:09.585 --> 48:13.154
Why don't you try that on with it?
Make you look really funky.

48:13.156 --> 48:14.721
Hmm. Do I wanna look funky?

48:14.723 --> 48:16.357
Maybe he prefers studious.

48:16.359 --> 48:18.293
Well, have you
got any glasses? No.

48:18.295 --> 48:19.997
Put the jacket on, then.
Okay.

48:23.132 --> 48:26.768
Yes. Yeah. I like.

48:26.770 --> 48:28.402
One cool chick.

48:28.404 --> 48:30.505
Where
are you going, anyway?

48:30.507 --> 48:32.273
Ooh, that place by the bridge.

48:32.275 --> 48:34.741
Nice. Expensive.
Is he paying?

48:34.743 --> 48:38.212
I really hope so. I'm now
officially homeless,

48:38.214 --> 48:39.281
since Patrick has
made it his mission

48:40.282 --> 48:41.451
to alert the landlord
to the "no pets" policy.

48:43.185 --> 48:45.154
Do you know, I might be
able to help you here.

48:45.688 --> 48:46.690
Really?

48:48.058 --> 48:49.259
My brother wants to rent out his
place while he's working abroad.

48:50.493 --> 48:51.726
He only needs to cover the costs.
Are you interested?

48:51.728 --> 48:53.130
Interested?

48:53.763 --> 48:55.498
Great. Yes.

48:57.232 --> 48:59.833
Ooh. These?
Yeah. Get 'em on.

48:59.835 --> 49:00.803
These ones?

49:02.672 --> 49:05.273
Hi. It's a table for two.
I think it's under Oliver.

49:05.275 --> 49:06.343
Yes.
Yeah.

49:07.877 --> 49:09.309
Please, ma'am, this way.
Thank you.

49:09.311 --> 49:11.346
Oh, can I just take
your coat...

49:11.348 --> 49:13.480
Oh, no. Sorry. It's part
of the thing. Sorry.

49:13.482 --> 49:14.551
My mistake.
Sorry. Whoops.

49:17.587 --> 49:19.154
Thanks.
Here is your table.

49:19.156 --> 49:20.322
Thank you.
I'll be back.

49:46.348 --> 49:47.447
Sorry.

49:47.449 --> 49:48.819
That's okay.

49:50.319 --> 49:51.321
Honestly.
I'm sorry.

49:52.522 --> 49:53.723
Don't. Don't worry. I've
been practicing my origami.

49:55.223 --> 49:56.324
Your what?

49:56.326 --> 49:58.561
Never mind. Were
you saving a life?

49:59.328 --> 50:00.330
Sorry?

50:01.496 --> 50:04.366
You know, get me a bag of
plasma and pass the forceps.

50:04.799 --> 50:07.503
Oh, no. I was just watching <i>Game
of Thrones</i> and lost track of time.

50:08.638 --> 50:09.672
Oh.
Hey.

50:10.906 --> 50:11.773
Have you chosen, sir? Yeah,
I'll have my usual, please.

50:11.775 --> 50:12.776
Of course.

50:13.942 --> 50:15.976
Wow. Never been out with a
guy who has a usual before.

50:15.978 --> 50:17.346
What's your usual?

50:18.915 --> 50:20.648
Well, it's Churrasco de Lomo. Side of
chips. Washed down by a good Malbec.

50:20.650 --> 50:21.849
Mmm. Sounds good.

50:21.851 --> 50:23.617
Yeah. I was gonna have a steak.

50:23.619 --> 50:25.353
Oh. It is a steak.

50:25.355 --> 50:28.225
Oh, right. I'll have
the same, please.

50:28.424 --> 50:29.426
Rare, please.

50:29.824 --> 50:31.226
Well done.

50:31.228 --> 50:33.328
She'll have hers
rare as well.

50:33.330 --> 50:34.297
Of course.
Trust me.

50:34.864 --> 50:35.866
Okay.

50:43.239 --> 50:45.273
Yeah, I've always loved
the sciences.

50:45.275 --> 50:48.009
I got an A star in chemistry,
biology and physics.

50:48.011 --> 50:49.811
Could have done anything
I wanted to, really.

50:49.813 --> 50:51.848
But my father and brothers
are doctors

50:52.882 --> 50:54.514
and he wanted me
to do the same.

50:54.516 --> 50:56.520
Yeah, but I rebelled,
became a vet.

50:57.453 --> 51:00.257
Not much of a rebellion, though, is it?
I earn more than my brother.

51:00.855 --> 51:02.757
Well, we don't do what we do
for the money, though, do we?

51:02.759 --> 51:03.726
We do it to make
a difference.

51:04.960 --> 51:05.561
Do you know you have to study
a year longer than a doctor

51:06.696 --> 51:07.230
'cause your patient can't
tell you where it hurts?

51:08.630 --> 51:11.331
Mind you, have you ever had a Doberman
sink its teeth into your arm?

51:11.333 --> 51:12.733
Hmm...

51:12.735 --> 51:14.371
I think he was trying
to tell me something.

51:15.503 --> 51:19.308
Anyway, enough about me.
Tell me about you.

51:20.308 --> 51:21.677
Tell me about Sarah Francis.

51:22.911 --> 51:24.346
Anything for dessert?

51:25.447 --> 51:28.549
Sarah? Pudding
or slice of cheese?

51:28.551 --> 51:29.851
No. No, I'm good.

51:29.853 --> 51:31.819
Okay. Well, we'll have
the bill, please.

51:31.821 --> 51:33.422
Okay. I'll be back.
Thank you.

51:34.389 --> 51:35.391
Happy to go halves?

51:36.891 --> 51:38.294
Mmm... Yeah.

51:38.793 --> 51:39.962
Then can I walk you home?

51:40.763 --> 51:41.862
Okay, thanks.

51:41.864 --> 51:42.965
Great.

51:44.032 --> 51:44.833
Oh. You could give your
patient the once over.

51:46.601 --> 51:49.070
Well, I kind of have
this unwritten rule thing

51:49.072 --> 51:51.340
where I don't see
my dates' pets for free,

51:52.308 --> 51:53.777
no matter how pretty
the girl is.

51:54.810 --> 51:56.376
Ah.

51:56.378 --> 51:58.413
The other thing
I'm good at is sport.

51:58.415 --> 52:02.349
This physique is entirely natural.
I really don't have to work at it.

52:02.351 --> 52:04.987
Wow. Amazing.
Mmm.

52:06.522 --> 52:10.324
Actually, Oliver, can we get coffee
another time? I'm just a bit tired.

52:10.326 --> 52:11.293
Are you sure?

52:12.527 --> 52:14.429
Yeah, and I've had a nice evening.
I just wanna go home.

52:14.431 --> 52:15.999
Well, how are you fixed
for next week?

52:17.065 --> 52:18.935
Ah... I'm not sure.
I'm a bit busy.

52:20.670 --> 52:22.339
Have... Have I done
something wrong?

52:22.904 --> 52:24.406
Er... The truth?

52:26.409 --> 52:28.478
Seriously, you... You
don't wanna see me again?

52:29.844 --> 52:30.980
No.

52:32.480 --> 52:35.116
Okay, you asked me out,
er, you were late,

52:35.118 --> 52:40.121
and, I mean, late, and then you
talked nonstop about yourself

52:40.123 --> 52:42.824
and then when I had the temerity to
suggest that you might wanna take

52:42.826 --> 52:45.528
a peek at your patient, you
said it's against the rules.

52:46.494 --> 52:48.563
But the steak was good,
wasn't it?

52:48.565 --> 52:50.767
And why go home
to an empty flat?

52:52.802 --> 52:55.505
Thanks, Oliver,
but no thanks.

52:56.739 --> 52:58.639
Oh, and, um,
for your information,

52:58.641 --> 53:00.744
I'm not going home
to an empty flat.

53:30.172 --> 53:32.475
Oh, hello.

53:33.442 --> 53:35.612
Hi. What are you doing
out here on your own?

53:36.746 --> 53:39.416
"Marshall Close. Max."

53:40.616 --> 53:42.485
Oh, I know where you live.

53:43.118 --> 53:45.119
Shall we go and see if anyone's at home?

53:45.121 --> 53:46.723
Yeah? Okay, come on.

53:47.589 --> 53:50.392
Come on.
Good boy. Come on.

54:04.639 --> 54:06.109
What? Eh?

54:06.641 --> 54:07.643
Hello?

54:08.578 --> 54:09.679
Hello, boy.
Where have you been?

54:10.746 --> 54:11.748
I wish you could... Sorry.
The door was open.

54:12.081 --> 54:13.614
Hi.

54:13.616 --> 54:15.483
Oh. You forgot
your way home, did you?

54:15.485 --> 54:17.184
Ooh! That looks nasty.

54:17.186 --> 54:18.619
You're getting
just like me.

54:21.857 --> 54:26.494
I've checked everywhere I can
think of, although, stupidly,

54:26.496 --> 54:27.962
forgot to check
just there.

54:27.964 --> 54:28.965
What are you
doing here?

54:29.864 --> 54:30.466
Oh, I've known
Albert for years.

54:31.134 --> 54:32.001
Yeah. If it wasn't for Ben,

54:32.868 --> 54:34.501
I should still be lying
on that towpath.

54:34.503 --> 54:35.904
Did you have a fall?

54:37.272 --> 54:40.442
No, no, I usually walk about with
fish fingers on me head. Ben,

54:40.676 --> 54:44.045
stick 'em in the freezer, will you?
I'll have 'em for me tea tomorrow.

54:44.047 --> 54:46.850
Good boy.
Good boy. You sit.

54:47.616 --> 54:50.650
You had me worried sick, you did.
I didn't know where you'd gone.

54:50.652 --> 54:53.489
And a chocolate digestive
wouldn't go amiss!

54:54.589 --> 54:56.625
Call yourselves
a rescue committee? Huh.

54:57.058 --> 54:58.692
You're welcome.

54:58.694 --> 54:59.862
Must have blacked out.

55:00.964 --> 55:03.563
Stubborn old bugger refuses
to go to the hospital.

55:03.565 --> 55:04.533
You look nice.

55:05.134 --> 55:06.634
Night out
with the girls?

55:06.636 --> 55:07.503
No. I wish.

55:11.139 --> 55:13.206
I think he's given
himself quite a scare.

55:13.208 --> 55:15.041
Worst part
was losing Max.

55:15.043 --> 55:16.677
Hmm.

55:16.679 --> 55:17.881
Did you have
a nice time?

55:19.047 --> 55:20.183
Not really.

55:23.752 --> 55:26.286
I keep telling him he needs
to get himself a scooter.

55:26.288 --> 55:28.523
I can't afford one.

55:28.525 --> 55:30.056
At least there's nothing
wrong with his hearing.

55:30.058 --> 55:31.558
Where's his wife?

55:31.560 --> 55:33.226
Er, she died last year.

55:33.228 --> 55:34.594
Hmm.

55:34.596 --> 55:36.465
Been married 50 years.
Wow.

55:37.031 --> 55:40.166
Fifty years. Don't think
I'd last a weekend.

55:40.168 --> 55:42.036
Where's the flaming tea?

55:42.038 --> 55:43.473
Make that a day.
Hmm.

55:45.607 --> 55:46.609
Sorry.

56:17.239 --> 56:20.675
You really wanna stretch out the
muscles before you start, all right?

56:20.677 --> 56:22.879
Otherwise, you'll end up
pulling something.

56:23.177 --> 56:24.480
Cor, talking of which...

56:27.850 --> 56:29.018
Hello.
Hello.

56:31.319 --> 56:33.753
Have a nice day.

56:33.755 --> 56:34.958
Oh.

56:35.924 --> 56:37.791
I don't usually put
them off that quickly.

56:37.793 --> 56:40.027
They're usually quite keen until
they see my soft toy collection.

56:40.029 --> 56:42.130
No, it wasn't you. It was me.
That was the vet.

56:42.665 --> 56:44.098
What?

56:44.100 --> 56:45.900
Oh. You've
dropped your wallet.

56:51.839 --> 56:53.808
Right, come on. This isn't gonna
get you ready for the 5K.

56:53.810 --> 56:54.875
On your feet, Francis.

56:54.877 --> 56:56.112
Come on.

57:05.955 --> 57:07.387
Well?

57:07.389 --> 57:08.956
What do you think?

57:08.958 --> 57:10.627
Huh?

57:13.328 --> 57:16.663
Not
in a million years

57:16.665 --> 57:18.967
am I ever gonna make five
kilometers is what I think.

57:19.701 --> 57:21.003
No. Of this.

57:24.206 --> 57:26.206
Well, it's my brother's,

57:26.208 --> 57:29.043
and he's away working
for at least two years,

57:29.045 --> 57:31.645
and I thought it would be
perfect for you and Patrick.

57:31.647 --> 57:33.213
It's not that expensive. I...

57:33.215 --> 57:34.918
I thought it'd be nice.

57:39.288 --> 57:41.087
Oh.

57:41.089 --> 57:42.956
Oh, Becky.

57:42.958 --> 57:44.326
Becky, it's wonderful.

57:44.826 --> 57:45.994
Oh, thank you.

57:46.862 --> 57:48.929
Thank you. I love it.
I just love it.

57:48.931 --> 57:50.099
You're welcome.
Oh!

57:52.266 --> 57:55.003
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

57:56.270 --> 57:58.240
Oh, my gosh. Look.

57:58.940 --> 58:00.976
Oh, Patrick, look at it.

58:12.654 --> 58:14.288
- Guys, come on. Seriously.
- I am turning it.

58:14.290 --> 58:15.824
- You've brought the wrong tools.
- Okay.

58:16.324 --> 58:18.627
What is going on here?

58:19.395 --> 58:20.263
Nothing.
Nothing.

58:20.795 --> 58:22.962
Ah. It doesn't look
like nothing to me.

58:22.964 --> 58:24.331
This is my dad's car.
It needs, erm...

58:24.333 --> 58:26.836
New tires. It needs...
New tires, new wheels.

58:27.435 --> 58:30.337
It's funny, 'cause I don't see
your dad anywhere 'round here.

58:30.339 --> 58:31.438
But don't worry,
I've gotta go.

58:31.440 --> 58:33.773
I'll... I'll call your dad
when I get into school.

58:33.775 --> 58:35.375
You don't need to call anyone.
Please, don't call anyone.

58:35.377 --> 58:36.444
No?
No.

58:36.446 --> 58:37.779
No.
No.

58:38.980 --> 58:40.949
So I ask you again, gentlemen,
what is going on here?

58:42.183 --> 58:43.483
We're stealing
the wheels, miss.

58:43.485 --> 58:44.654
What else am
I gonna say?

58:45.821 --> 58:46.355
How do you even know how
to do something like that?

58:47.422 --> 58:49.355
Watched a couple of videos.
Yeah.

58:49.357 --> 58:50.659
His brother showed him.
Yeah.

58:51.293 --> 58:52.328
Right, where's
your brother?

58:53.795 --> 58:55.462
- Doesn't matter.
- He's in juvie, miss.

58:55.464 --> 58:57.232
Ah. Shut up, Spike.
I'm sorry.

58:57.766 --> 58:58.801
Sorry, man.

58:59.868 --> 59:03.369
Okay, look, I'm not gonna
tell anyone about this,

59:03.371 --> 59:06.974
okay? But if I hear or catch any of
you doing something like this again,

59:06.976 --> 59:09.309
I will happily call the police.

59:09.311 --> 59:10.980
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Whoa, whoa.
Where are you going?

59:12.147 --> 59:14.514
Sorry. You're not getting
away with this scot-free.

59:14.516 --> 59:15.717
Miss, I've got to...

59:17.219 --> 59:17.954
It'll be my third detention this
week. I'll get in so much trouble.

59:19.154 --> 59:19.755
Ooh, no, no. It's way worse
than detention, Spike, okay?

59:20.757 --> 59:23.190
This is the Miss Francis
community service, okay?

59:23.192 --> 59:25.759
You are all gonna
sign up for the fun run.

59:25.761 --> 59:27.128
Aw, miss!
And get £20 sponsorship.

59:29.866 --> 59:33.067
No arguments. And... And you're
gonna start your training now.

59:33.069 --> 59:34.268
How?

59:34.270 --> 59:36.739
You can run along.

59:43.045 --> 59:44.344
Go on. They've
got to be eaten.

59:44.346 --> 59:45.681
They've actually
got to be...

59:46.715 --> 59:47.315
Maureen, these
cupcakes are gorgeous.

59:48.083 --> 59:48.818
Aren't they good?
Yes, I know.

59:49.418 --> 59:49.886
Let me try one.
Er, no.

59:50.685 --> 59:51.119
Not until you've
finished the run.

59:51.819 --> 59:52.955
Ah, that's so unfair.
No.

59:54.322 --> 59:56.023
Cupcake?

59:56.025 --> 59:57.293
Thank you.

59:58.661 --> 01:00:00.027
Oh, it's not a term of endearment.
I'm offering you a cupcake.

01:00:00.029 --> 01:00:01.164
No, thank you, Maureen.

01:00:02.697 --> 01:00:05.268
My class and I are off for a jog in
the park in preparation for the run.

01:00:06.067 --> 01:00:08.869
Head teacher's very
impressed with the turnout.

01:00:08.871 --> 01:00:10.904
Such a shame your class
aren't as keen, Miss Francis.

01:00:10.906 --> 01:00:12.307
Ah, well, that's where
you're wrong, Mr. Peters.

01:00:12.775 --> 01:00:13.876
All the boys in my class

01:00:15.310 --> 01:00:16.311
have now signed up and some of the
girls are showing interest too.

01:00:17.446 --> 01:00:19.214
What on Earth did you
threaten them with? Nothing.

01:00:19.882 --> 01:00:21.884
They're doing it 'cause
they want to be my friends.

01:00:23.051 --> 01:00:24.353
You want
to be careful, you know.

01:00:25.721 --> 01:00:27.420
I hear he's next in line for the
headmaster when Phillips retires.

01:00:27.422 --> 01:00:29.056
Well, I'm sorry.
He started it.

01:00:29.058 --> 01:00:30.456
Yeah.
But we want you to stay.

01:00:30.458 --> 01:00:32.027
Yes, we do, we do.
So do I.

01:00:33.228 --> 01:00:34.328
Cupcake.

01:00:34.330 --> 01:00:36.199
No. Maureen, stop it.

01:00:37.532 --> 01:00:39.532
Why is it my stuff
that had to go into storage?

01:00:39.534 --> 01:00:40.837
Hmm?

01:01:08.496 --> 01:01:09.695
So what is it about
Victorian England

01:01:09.697 --> 01:01:13.400
that makes Mrs. Rochester
so unacceptable to society?

01:01:19.273 --> 01:01:20.574
Yes?

01:01:40.897 --> 01:01:42.929
Come on, you lazy...
Oops!

01:01:55.344 --> 01:01:56.311
Sarah?

01:01:59.214 --> 01:02:00.614
No.

01:02:00.616 --> 01:02:01.951
Wait.

01:02:03.085 --> 01:02:04.887
No. Oh, my God.

01:02:05.253 --> 01:02:07.554
Oh, my God.
It's so cute.

01:02:07.556 --> 01:02:09.358
Come in. Come in.
There you go.

01:02:12.460 --> 01:02:15.161
Thank you. Thank you.

01:02:15.163 --> 01:02:17.297
Do I get one of these
or is it just...

01:02:17.299 --> 01:02:19.266
No, you risk
your life, I'm afraid.

01:02:19.268 --> 01:02:20.366
I'm destined to drown.

01:02:36.953 --> 01:02:38.018
Carly Williams?

01:02:38.020 --> 01:02:38.987
Present.

01:02:39.353 --> 01:02:40.587
Michael Azikiwe?

01:02:40.589 --> 01:02:41.556
Yeah.

01:02:42.223 --> 01:02:43.258
Vikki Andrews?

01:02:45.293 --> 01:02:46.295
Vikki?

01:02:48.496 --> 01:02:49.998
Does anyone know
where Vikki is?

01:02:52.067 --> 01:02:53.202
Come on.

01:02:54.569 --> 01:02:56.071
Spit it out. We've got an English
GCSE to accomplish by lunchtime.

01:02:57.139 --> 01:02:59.639
Erm, Vikki's mum and dad
have been having problems.

01:02:59.641 --> 01:03:01.041
She's not
really handling it.

01:03:01.043 --> 01:03:02.375
Tariq, that's private.

01:03:02.377 --> 01:03:03.345
Sorry.

01:03:06.281 --> 01:03:08.215
Is she in trouble, miss?

01:03:08.217 --> 01:03:09.218
Not if I can help it.

01:03:09.685 --> 01:03:12.085
Er, my nan's
got dodgy knees.

01:03:12.087 --> 01:03:13.454
I was wondering,
can I be excused too?

01:03:15.489 --> 01:03:18.257
Nice try. Right,
turn over your papers.

01:03:18.259 --> 01:03:20.128
You have 90 minutes. Begin.

01:03:33.407 --> 01:03:34.442
<i>Hey, it's Vikki.</i>

01:03:35.377 --> 01:03:36.212
<i>Leave a message
and I'll call you back.</i>

01:03:46.255 --> 01:03:47.587
Hello.
Hi.

01:03:47.589 --> 01:03:49.557
I'm Miss Francis,
Vikki's English teacher.

01:03:50.424 --> 01:03:53.626
Look, I tried to get her
to that exam this morning.

01:03:53.628 --> 01:03:55.364
I tell her how
important it is.

01:03:56.163 --> 01:03:58.431
But we're going through
a few family problems.

01:03:58.433 --> 01:04:00.500
Hmm. I'm so sorry
to hear that.

01:04:00.502 --> 01:04:03.036
Oh. My husband and I
are splitting up.

01:04:03.038 --> 01:04:04.506
You just love telling
people, don't you?

01:04:05.473 --> 01:04:08.108
She's, um,
taking it quite badly.

01:04:08.110 --> 01:04:09.245
My...

01:04:12.014 --> 01:04:13.015
Am I in trouble?

01:04:14.081 --> 01:04:16.282
Not with me. Do you wanna
come for a walk with us?

01:04:16.284 --> 01:04:18.085
Yeah, I'll just
grab my coat.

01:04:18.087 --> 01:04:21.621
Oh. I see you'll do
something when she asks.

01:04:21.623 --> 01:04:24.092
Yeah. She asks
me nicely.

01:04:26.460 --> 01:04:27.495
Ah...

01:04:32.199 --> 01:04:33.368
See what I'm up against?

01:04:34.469 --> 01:04:35.604
And she's decided

01:04:36.871 --> 01:04:38.237
she doesn't want to come and
live with me and my boyfriend.

01:04:38.239 --> 01:04:39.375
She wants to stay.

01:04:41.442 --> 01:04:42.742
With her dad.

01:04:42.744 --> 01:04:44.145
Oh...

01:04:45.047 --> 01:04:46.313
We'll be right back.

01:04:46.315 --> 01:04:47.483
Okay.

01:04:53.422 --> 01:04:54.423
Look, I'm really sorry.

01:04:55.589 --> 01:04:57.590
Vikki, you're good at English, okay?
One of the best.

01:04:57.592 --> 01:04:59.692
I predict a seven
for you, no problem.

01:04:59.694 --> 01:05:03.198
But the one thing you have to
do is turn up for the exam.

01:05:03.831 --> 01:05:05.799
It's just this
whole thing at home.

01:05:05.801 --> 01:05:08.069
I feel so crap
all the time.

01:05:09.270 --> 01:05:10.739
I didn't go 'cause
I don't wanna mess up.

01:05:12.206 --> 01:05:15.842
Okay. Can I tell you something
you must keep to yourself?

01:05:15.844 --> 01:05:18.311
Yeah. No one listens
to me anyway.

01:05:18.313 --> 01:05:20.646
Okay, well,
I have an older sister

01:05:20.648 --> 01:05:23.349
and I have always
lived in her shadow.

01:05:23.351 --> 01:05:25.485
You know,
she's got everything,

01:05:25.487 --> 01:05:27.621
she's achieved
everything.

01:05:27.623 --> 01:05:29.792
My mum never fails
to let me know it.

01:05:30.558 --> 01:05:33.427
But my granny gave me
a really good bit of advice.

01:05:33.429 --> 01:05:36.630
She said, "Just keep putting one
foot in front of the other,

01:05:36.632 --> 01:05:38.701
"and in the end,
it feels like walking."

01:05:39.701 --> 01:05:43.773
So I've arranged for you to come in this
Saturday and sit your English paper.

01:05:44.572 --> 01:05:45.838
Are you serious?

01:05:45.840 --> 01:05:47.208
You've done
that for me?

01:05:48.509 --> 01:05:50.309
Of course. You mustn't discuss
your paper with anyone else.

01:05:50.311 --> 01:05:51.380
Understood?

01:05:52.947 --> 01:05:55.148
I will know if you've seen the questions
before, okay? I'm weird like that.

01:05:55.150 --> 01:05:57.683
I absolutely swear. Cross
my heart and hope to die.

01:05:57.685 --> 01:05:58.753
Don't go that far.

01:05:59.587 --> 01:06:01.587
Right, we should
get you back.

01:06:01.589 --> 01:06:02.690
Come on, then.

01:06:04.592 --> 01:06:07.226
You didn't have any
plans this Saturday, did you?

01:06:07.228 --> 01:06:08.661
No, I never
do anything.

01:06:25.679 --> 01:06:27.213
Hello?

01:06:27.215 --> 01:06:28.350
Hello. Sarah?

01:06:28.917 --> 01:06:30.152
Ben?

01:06:30.618 --> 01:06:31.653
Is that you?

01:06:34.188 --> 01:06:36.391
I disappoint again.

01:06:37.324 --> 01:06:38.558
Peace offering?

01:06:38.560 --> 01:06:39.661
Come on.

01:06:40.962 --> 01:06:44.230
So, what brings you to
the Boat People of Wetlandia?

01:06:44.232 --> 01:06:47.300
I came because I've been thinking
about what you said the other night.

01:06:47.302 --> 01:06:48.869
And I hear you're
doing a fun run.

01:06:48.871 --> 01:06:51.938
Ah. Well, you're half right.
I am running.

01:06:51.940 --> 01:06:54.275
That's great.
I'd love to sponsor you.

01:06:55.310 --> 01:06:57.677
I take it you're doing it
for a good cause?

01:06:57.679 --> 01:07:01.516
Maybe the rehabilitation of
hopelessly socially inadequate vets?

01:07:01.782 --> 01:07:02.951
Something like that.

01:07:03.817 --> 01:07:06.686
Of course, um, you're almost
guaranteed not to have to pay

01:07:06.688 --> 01:07:08.989
as the likelihood of me
finishing 5K is pretty slim.

01:07:12.493 --> 01:07:13.528
Okay.

01:07:14.628 --> 01:07:15.594
Oh!

01:07:15.596 --> 01:07:19.333
Wow. Are you sure?
That is very generous.

01:07:19.335 --> 01:07:20.500
That's me.

01:07:20.502 --> 01:07:21.569
Inadequate but generous.

01:07:22.837 --> 01:07:25.973
I'm really gonna
have to do this now, aren't I?

01:07:25.975 --> 01:07:27.541
Afraid so.

01:07:34.516 --> 01:07:36.782
Ugh. I've survived
my first term.

01:07:36.784 --> 01:07:39.585
You've more than survived.
You've made a difference.

01:07:39.587 --> 01:07:41.288
To who?
To the kids.

01:07:41.290 --> 01:07:42.623
What are you
talking about?

01:07:42.625 --> 01:07:44.757
Oh. Maureen.

01:07:44.759 --> 01:07:45.991
Are you going
on somewhere?

01:07:45.993 --> 01:07:49.764
Eh... Oh. No, no. Someone
told me it was fancy dress.

01:07:51.366 --> 01:07:52.733
Well, I think
you look fabulous.

01:07:52.735 --> 01:07:53.702
I know.

01:07:55.670 --> 01:07:57.971
Congratulations, Miss Francis.

01:07:57.973 --> 01:08:00.007
You're not doing as badly
as I predicted you would.

01:08:00.009 --> 01:08:03.409
Oh. I feel damned by faint praise.
Thank you, Mr. Peters.

01:08:03.411 --> 01:08:04.677
I think.

01:08:04.679 --> 01:08:06.281
Are you ready
for the 5K run?

01:08:07.348 --> 01:08:08.383
Getting there.

01:08:09.551 --> 01:08:11.817
You're not really running
for the Pug Rescue, are you?

01:08:11.819 --> 01:08:13.488
Well, a dog's got
something to do with it.

01:08:14.322 --> 01:08:15.621
Wise arse.

01:08:15.623 --> 01:08:16.624
I heard that.

01:08:16.890 --> 01:08:18.426
Yeah, you were
meant to.

01:08:18.692 --> 01:08:19.694
Right.

01:08:20.495 --> 01:08:22.198
Five, six.
One missing.

01:09:33.600 --> 01:09:34.636
Patrick!

01:09:36.569 --> 01:09:37.572
Patrick?

01:09:40.975 --> 01:09:43.312
Patrick,
where are you?

01:09:44.745 --> 01:09:45.747
Patrick?

01:09:47.448 --> 01:09:48.450
Patrick!

01:09:55.522 --> 01:09:56.922
Well,
is he micro-chipped?

01:09:56.924 --> 01:09:57.892
I don't know.

01:09:58.826 --> 01:09:59.794
Oh, look, I'm sure
we're gonna find him.

01:10:00.629 --> 01:10:01.563
What are you basing
that on exactly?

01:10:02.297 --> 01:10:03.796
Well, he's such
a lovely chap.

01:10:03.798 --> 01:10:05.165
Look, why don't
we split up,

01:10:05.167 --> 01:10:06.699
and then we'll
report back here.

01:10:06.701 --> 01:10:08.100
Right. Okay.

01:10:08.102 --> 01:10:10.170
I'll get more help.
Right, so...

01:10:10.172 --> 01:10:12.139
Oh, sorry, sorry.
That was my...

01:10:12.141 --> 01:10:14.507
Sorry. I'm so sorry.
The cakes!

01:10:14.509 --> 01:10:15.643
I'm off to Pilates.

01:10:28.522 --> 01:10:29.922
Oh. Hi.

01:10:29.924 --> 01:10:31.457
Sarah.
You get around.

01:10:31.459 --> 01:10:32.525
Who is it?

01:10:32.527 --> 01:10:33.627
Oh, I was looking for Vikki.

01:10:33.629 --> 01:10:34.596
She's upstairs.

01:10:35.562 --> 01:10:37.063
Hello, Miss Francis.
I'll get her for you.

01:10:37.065 --> 01:10:38.701
This is Ben,
my husband.

01:10:39.467 --> 01:10:41.001
I was gonna tell you.
Oh.

01:10:41.003 --> 01:10:42.071
Miss Francis
is downstairs.

01:10:43.071 --> 01:10:43.670
Er, no. I mean, why...
Why would you tell me?

01:10:43.672 --> 01:10:45.738
That's absolutely fine.

01:10:45.740 --> 01:10:48.742
Okay, you're Vikki's dad.
I should have known that.

01:10:48.744 --> 01:10:49.876
Hey, Miss Francis.

01:10:49.878 --> 01:10:50.943
What's up?

01:10:50.945 --> 01:10:52.013
Hi. Erm.
I've lost Patrick.

01:10:53.014 --> 01:10:53.615
I was wondering if you
could help me find him,

01:10:54.848 --> 01:10:55.547
if you're not too busy. Of course.
I'll go and get my coat.

01:10:55.549 --> 01:10:57.951
Can I help?
No! I mean,

01:10:57.953 --> 01:10:59.853
no, it's fine.
We'll be fine.

01:10:59.855 --> 01:11:02.154
So, I'll see you around.

01:11:02.156 --> 01:11:03.590
Let's go
and find Patrick.

01:11:03.592 --> 01:11:04.560
I was gonna tell you.

01:11:05.627 --> 01:11:07.127
Oh. No, honestly, please.
Why would you tell me?

01:11:07.129 --> 01:11:08.862
That's weird,
if anything,

01:11:08.864 --> 01:11:10.031
if you'd told me.

01:11:12.499 --> 01:11:13.534
Bye. I mean,
it's not even a thing.

01:11:14.869 --> 01:11:15.437
Why would you think it's a thing
when it's not even a thing?

01:11:16.704 --> 01:11:17.106
I mean, stop talking to yourself.
You sound completely mad.

01:11:17.572 --> 01:11:18.374
Sorry?
Nothing.

01:11:44.231 --> 01:11:46.166
Oh, Granny,
I'm so sorry.

01:11:58.679 --> 01:12:00.881
Sarah, what
have you done?

01:12:00.883 --> 01:12:03.685
Happy birthday, Dad.

01:12:06.020 --> 01:12:08.020
There, there, pudding.

01:12:08.022 --> 01:12:09.788
He'll turn up.

01:12:09.790 --> 01:12:11.056
Come on.

01:12:11.058 --> 01:12:12.993
Don't tell
Caroline I cried.

01:12:12.995 --> 01:12:14.530
No, of course not.

01:12:16.063 --> 01:12:18.265
Toffee, pudding?
They're your favorite.

01:12:18.267 --> 01:12:19.535
Oh. I won't.

01:12:20.669 --> 01:12:21.203
I'm supposed to be running
five kilometers tomorrow.

01:12:22.003 --> 01:12:23.036
Why? Have you
stolen something?

01:12:25.740 --> 01:12:27.908
To be honest, I don't feel
much like doing it anyway.

01:12:27.910 --> 01:12:29.009
Why?

01:12:29.011 --> 01:12:30.109
I'm missing Patrick.

01:12:30.111 --> 01:12:31.078
Oh, Sarah.

01:12:32.245 --> 01:12:33.947
He grunts and snores, but
he's kind of growing on me.

01:12:33.949 --> 01:12:35.814
I have that magic too.

01:12:35.816 --> 01:12:37.317
Sounds like a perfect
match to me.

01:12:37.319 --> 01:12:40.153
Oh, shut up. Honestly, I'm
not surprised you lost him.

01:12:40.155 --> 01:12:41.688
Ah, now,
that's not fair.

01:12:41.690 --> 01:12:43.957
No. Sarah tries very hard.

01:12:43.959 --> 01:12:46.292
Yes, and one day
she's going to succeed.

01:12:46.294 --> 01:12:49.095
Sorry, can you all stop
being so patronizing, please?

01:12:51.732 --> 01:12:53.099
Dad, is there
anything to drink?

01:12:53.101 --> 01:12:55.167
Of course, pudding.
What would you like?

01:12:55.169 --> 01:12:57.269
Anything that comes
in a pint glass. Please.

01:12:57.271 --> 01:12:58.971
Gin and tonic.
Sounds great.

01:12:58.973 --> 01:13:00.840
Second thoughts,
hold the tonic.

01:13:00.842 --> 01:13:02.945
I thought you were meant to
be doing a fun run tomorrow.

01:13:03.811 --> 01:13:05.644
Now, if you'll excuse me,

01:13:05.646 --> 01:13:07.882
I'm going to the kitchen to
celebrate my dad's birthday.

01:13:09.616 --> 01:13:12.721
Honestly, you can't say anything to her.
She's so sensitive.

01:13:14.121 --> 01:13:15.223
What?

01:13:21.295 --> 01:13:23.130
Aw. Thank you.

01:13:24.331 --> 01:13:25.601
Oh...

01:14:21.322 --> 01:14:23.025
Sarah? Hello?

01:14:24.359 --> 01:14:25.660
It's Ben.

01:14:43.111 --> 01:14:44.711
Right, who's
for Daddy's pancakes?

01:14:44.713 --> 01:14:46.211
Me, me, me.
Ooh, yes, please, Daddy.

01:14:46.213 --> 01:14:47.582
Why did no one wake me?

01:14:48.917 --> 01:14:50.819
I'm gonna be late for my run.
I've got sponsors and everything.

01:14:51.218 --> 01:14:53.252
I'm a sponsor
and I don't mind.

01:14:53.254 --> 01:14:55.121
You needed your
sleep, darling.

01:14:55.123 --> 01:14:57.857
Oh. This
is important to me.

01:14:57.859 --> 01:14:59.361
Are you sure that gin's
out of your system?

01:15:00.093 --> 01:15:02.864
Could you say something helpful
for just once in your life?

01:15:03.830 --> 01:15:05.032
What? What
have I done?

01:15:15.176 --> 01:15:17.111
What? What?

01:15:19.112 --> 01:15:21.016
Has someone died
in an accident?

01:15:22.182 --> 01:15:26.253
Weird. Okay.
Come on. Oh, God.

01:15:34.995 --> 01:15:35.998
Oh...

01:15:36.463 --> 01:15:38.797
I am actually
gonna be exhausted

01:15:38.799 --> 01:15:40.936
before this stupid
race even starts.

01:15:43.905 --> 01:15:45.706
Ah... No!

01:15:48.709 --> 01:15:50.011
You've missed it.
They left 20 minutes ago.

01:15:52.146 --> 01:15:53.979
Honestly,

01:15:53.981 --> 01:15:56.817
I can't get anything right.
I am utterly useless.

01:16:00.887 --> 01:16:02.322
Well, why aren't
you running?

01:16:02.324 --> 01:16:03.924
Pulled a hamstring.

01:16:04.459 --> 01:16:06.792
Typical.

01:16:06.794 --> 01:16:08.862
After all that crowing over me
and you're not even running.

01:16:08.864 --> 01:16:10.095
No.

01:16:10.097 --> 01:16:12.332
We need to get
these in the cars.

01:16:12.334 --> 01:16:14.801
My sponsorship was gonna
make an old man very happy,

01:16:14.803 --> 01:16:16.104
or at least a bit
less miserable.

01:16:17.038 --> 01:16:18.839
Oh, honestly,
I could weep.

01:16:22.142 --> 01:16:23.177
Miss Francis.

01:16:23.910 --> 01:16:24.945
Sarah.

01:16:27.781 --> 01:16:29.685
I could vouch
for you starting.

01:16:30.418 --> 01:16:32.320
I am Mrs. Phillips' deputy.

01:16:33.788 --> 01:16:35.857
Oh, thank you. Erm...

01:16:36.891 --> 01:16:38.026
Peregrine.

01:16:40.026 --> 01:16:41.228
Like the falcon?

01:16:42.163 --> 01:16:43.231
Yes.

01:16:45.900 --> 01:16:48.469
Thank you, er, Peregrine.

01:16:51.838 --> 01:16:53.774
Back behind
the line, please.

01:16:55.042 --> 01:16:57.510
As if that's gonna make a
difference over five kilometers.

01:16:57.512 --> 01:16:59.781
Well, we might
as well do it properly.

01:17:02.917 --> 01:17:03.919
Three,

01:17:04.451 --> 01:17:07.289
two, one. Waah!

01:17:08.889 --> 01:17:10.189
What was that?

01:17:10.191 --> 01:17:11.493
Mrs. Phillips
had a klaxon.

01:17:12.927 --> 01:17:14.029
Okay.

01:17:15.463 --> 01:17:16.764
Let's do this thing.

01:17:47.128 --> 01:17:48.130
Okay.

01:17:57.405 --> 01:17:58.872
Come here, doggy.

01:17:58.874 --> 01:17:59.939
Where are you going?

01:17:59.941 --> 01:18:01.241
Are you okay?

01:18:05.112 --> 01:18:06.880
Are you sure
you're okay?

01:18:06.882 --> 01:18:08.547
Yeah. Yeah. I'm fine.

01:19:11.212 --> 01:19:13.246
<i>Could I just make a safety note?</i>

01:19:13.248 --> 01:19:15.280
<i>Please do not lean
on the barriers.</i>

01:19:15.282 --> 01:19:16.683
<i>We have had a number
of incidents today.</i>

01:19:16.685 --> 01:19:20.155
<i>And we also do have
a lot...</i>

01:19:20.521 --> 01:19:22.387
Go on, Mikey. Go on.

01:19:22.389 --> 01:19:24.489
<i>And the
winner is Michael Azikiwe.</i>

01:19:25.593 --> 01:19:27.560
I am so proud
of you.

01:19:27.562 --> 01:19:29.194
Well done.
You've actually done it.

01:19:29.196 --> 01:19:30.297
Awesome.

01:19:31.598 --> 01:19:33.599
<i>Oh, well done,
Michael. Congratulations.</i>

01:19:33.601 --> 01:19:35.603
<i>Oh, I didn't know
you were a runner.</i>

01:19:37.405 --> 01:19:39.104
Why didn't you tell me
you could run like that?

01:19:39.106 --> 01:19:41.006
I don't know. Miss
Francis made me do it.

01:19:41.008 --> 01:19:43.408
Well, you make sure
you thank Miss Francis.

01:19:43.410 --> 01:19:44.645
You've got talent.

01:19:56.156 --> 01:19:57.422
<i>We have canceled</i>

01:19:57.424 --> 01:19:59.427
<i>the sponge-a-teacher game
I'm afraid.</i>

01:20:00.294 --> 01:20:01.661
<i>If people could be
a little more...</i>

01:20:01.663 --> 01:20:03.964
Vikki! Vikki!

01:20:05.231 --> 01:20:06.967
Hey-hey-Hey!

01:20:10.137 --> 01:20:11.470
You did it,
darling.

01:20:11.472 --> 01:20:12.604
Well done.

01:20:12.606 --> 01:20:14.774
Thanks, Dad.

01:20:14.776 --> 01:20:17.010
I'm sorry I've been
so difficult recently.

01:20:17.012 --> 01:20:18.380
Oh... Don't worry.

01:20:19.146 --> 01:20:20.548
It's been hard
on all of us.

01:20:21.382 --> 01:20:23.382
It'll be easier
now Mum's gone.

01:20:23.384 --> 01:20:25.283
It's better for her.

01:20:25.285 --> 01:20:27.922
And you and me,
we'll manage just fine.

01:20:42.402 --> 01:20:43.603
Hi.

01:20:43.605 --> 01:20:44.940
Oh, hi.

01:20:45.740 --> 01:20:47.640
Little bit late,
aren't we?

01:20:47.642 --> 01:20:50.777
No, just early
for next year.

01:20:50.779 --> 01:20:53.145
I can run with you
for a bit if you like.

01:20:53.147 --> 01:20:55.213
Eases the pain to have
someone to talk to.

01:20:55.215 --> 01:20:57.185
Oh... I can't...

01:20:58.552 --> 01:21:00.252
<i>Miss Shaw!</i>

01:21:00.254 --> 01:21:01.621
Yes, Mrs. Phillips?

01:21:01.623 --> 01:21:02.691
<i>I've just...</i> Oh.

01:21:03.758 --> 01:21:05.224
I've, erm, I've just had
a message from Mr. Peters.

01:21:05.226 --> 01:21:07.260
Miss Francis is running.

01:21:07.262 --> 01:21:09.394
She was late,
but she did start.

01:21:09.396 --> 01:21:10.364
Brilliant.

01:21:11.298 --> 01:21:13.399
Can I borrow
your loudhailer?

01:21:13.401 --> 01:21:14.369
I'm just gonna...

01:21:15.503 --> 01:21:17.304
Just... I'm just gonna take...

01:21:21.542 --> 01:21:23.708
Maureen.
Lovely baps.

01:21:23.710 --> 01:21:25.110
Thank you.

01:21:25.112 --> 01:21:27.212
I think you've
got it from here.

01:21:27.214 --> 01:21:28.448
Friends?

01:21:28.450 --> 01:21:29.451
Friends.

01:21:34.554 --> 01:21:36.124
<i>Listen up, everybody.</i>

01:21:37.592 --> 01:21:41.096
<i>My friend Sarah started the race
20 minutes after everyone else.</i>

01:21:41.661 --> 01:21:46.565
<i>She's raised sponsorship of £1,000 to
buy an old man a mobility scooter.</i>

01:21:46.567 --> 01:21:49.101
<i>If anyone could just spare
a little bit of time</i>

01:21:49.103 --> 01:21:51.539
<i>to cheer her home,
please stay.</i>

01:21:52.272 --> 01:21:53.273
<i>Please.</i>

01:21:53.706 --> 01:21:56.044
<i>Don't leave.
Please, come on.</i>

01:22:09.722 --> 01:22:10.957
Oh, ooh!

01:22:14.829 --> 01:22:17.430
Oh, no. I don't think
she's coming.

01:22:17.432 --> 01:22:18.600
She will.
Have some faith.

01:22:21.835 --> 01:22:23.303
Oh, God.

01:22:24.504 --> 01:22:25.507
If she had any sense,

01:22:26.673 --> 01:22:27.307
she'd have stopped for a
cup of coffee and a cake.

01:22:52.232 --> 01:22:55.167
Miss Francis! Miss Francis!

01:22:55.169 --> 01:22:57.739
Miss Francis! Miss Francis!

01:22:59.706 --> 01:23:03.242
Come on, Sarah.
You can do it. Come on.

01:23:07.581 --> 01:23:11.085
Come on, Sarah, keep going.
Keep going. Go on.

01:23:11.552 --> 01:23:13.822
Miss Francis! Miss Francis!

01:23:23.329 --> 01:23:25.598
Oh. Come on, Sarah.
You can do it.

01:23:25.600 --> 01:23:27.468
Miss Francis! Miss Francis!

01:23:45.352 --> 01:23:47.519
Miss, miss, no.
Come on, you can do it.

01:23:57.498 --> 01:23:59.267
Patrick?

01:24:04.972 --> 01:24:06.708
Miss Francis! Miss Francis!

01:24:08.743 --> 01:24:10.477
Miss Francis! Miss Francis!

01:24:11.212 --> 01:24:14.247
Miss Francis! Miss Francis!

01:24:14.249 --> 01:24:17.283
Miss Francis! Miss Francis!
