00:00.590 --> 00:02.848
A coffee controversy
is brewing tonight.

00:02.882 --> 00:06.685
A new shop in Los Feliz is
calling itself "Dumb Starbucks."

00:06.719 --> 00:07.736
Dumb Starbucks.

00:07.770 --> 00:09.154
Dumb Starbucks.

00:09.188 --> 00:10.155
Dumb Starbucks.

00:10.189 --> 00:11.189
Dumb Starbucks.

00:11.240 --> 00:12.490
Dumb Starbucks.

00:12.525 --> 00:13.491
Dumb Starbucks.

00:13.526 --> 00:16.912
Dumb...

00:16.946 --> 00:17.996
Dumb Starbucks.

00:18.030 --> 00:21.616
<i>Its origin and owner
are a mystery.</i>

00:21.667 --> 00:23.702
<i>My name is Nathan Fielder,</i>

00:23.704 --> 00:26.755
<i>And I graduated from one
of Canada's top business schools</i>

00:26.789 --> 00:29.207
<i>with really good grades.</i>

00:29.258 --> 00:30.926
<i>Now I'm using my knowledge</i>

00:30.960 --> 00:33.378
<i>to help struggling
small business owners make it</i>

00:33.429 --> 00:34.546
<i>in this competitive world.</i>

00:39.255 --> 00:43.350

00:43.472 --> 00:45.473
This is
<i>Nathan for You.</i>

00:47.059 --> 00:49.644
<i>Elias Zacklin is the owner
of Helio Cafe,</i>

00:49.695 --> 00:52.564
<i>a small coffee shop
in East Hollywood, California.</i>

00:52.615 --> 00:55.650
<i>And he prides himself on doing
things a little bit different.</i>

00:55.701 --> 00:57.452
The atmosphere's
very eclectic.

00:57.486 --> 00:59.037
You don't walk in and--

00:59.071 --> 01:02.490
Actually, there's even--
not even a menu in my shop.

01:02.541 --> 01:04.292
And that's been done
purposefully.

01:04.327 --> 01:06.494
<i>But in a world
where one company</i>

01:06.545 --> 01:08.580
<i>has practically perfected
the coffee experience,</i>

01:08.582 --> 01:13.051
<i>going against the grain has
caused Elias' shop to be empty,</i>

01:13.085 --> 01:15.637
<i>so I paid him a visit with a way
for him to finally compete</i>

01:15.671 --> 01:16.805
<i>with the big players.</i>

01:16.839 --> 01:18.840
The problem with you
is you have great coffee

01:18.891 --> 01:21.426
but just no one knows
what this place is.

01:21.477 --> 01:22.727
- Correct.
- No one--

01:22.762 --> 01:24.396
You don't have a brand
that people recognize.

01:24.430 --> 01:26.529
- Absolutely.
- But maybe there's a shortcut

01:26.551 --> 01:29.024
to actually having
brand recognition.

01:29.126 --> 01:31.482
Using a little something
called parody law.

01:32.399 --> 01:33.732
Parody law.

01:33.734 --> 01:36.952
<i>Often used by artists like
"Weird Al" Yankovic</i>

01:36.987 --> 01:38.654
<i>and shows like
</i> Saturday Night Live <i>,</i>

01:38.705 --> 01:41.317
<i>parody law allows you
to use trademarks</i>

01:41.341 --> 01:44.076
<i>and copyrighted material as long
as you're making fun of them.</i>

01:44.430 --> 01:47.506
<i>So if Elias could find a way
to make fun of Starbucks,</i>

01:47.558 --> 01:50.393
<i>he'd be free and clear to borrow
their valuable corporate name</i>

01:50.427 --> 01:52.311
<i>and image for his store.</i>

01:52.346 --> 01:54.981
<i>The plan:
turn the Helio Cafe</i>

01:55.015 --> 01:58.234
<i>into the world's first
parody Starbucks.</i>

01:58.268 --> 02:01.191
So how do you make that
a parody without it--

02:01.342 --> 02:04.293
You just not mimicking
their brand?

02:04.678 --> 02:08.648
Like, the coffees could be
"Dumb Grande," "Dumb Venti"...

02:08.681 --> 02:10.233
- Yeah, I got you.
- "Dumb Frappuccino."

02:10.267 --> 02:11.517
Gotcha.
Okay.

02:11.519 --> 02:13.486
I mean, as a whole, the store
could just be called

02:13.520 --> 02:14.904
- "Dumb Starbucks."
- Right. That's--

02:14.938 --> 02:16.355
Okay, I see what you're saying.
Right.

02:16.406 --> 02:18.491
But the "Dumb" could be small
so people could come in

02:18.525 --> 02:20.526
thinking it's
an actual Starbucks.

02:20.577 --> 02:22.328
Huh.
It's smart, I just don't know

02:22.362 --> 02:24.330
if people would get it.
You know.

02:24.364 --> 02:27.116
I don't know if people are,
you know...

02:27.167 --> 02:28.534
Well, do people get
what you're doing now?

02:28.536 --> 02:30.536
- You're not that popular.
- Right.

02:30.538 --> 02:32.872
- You have no menu.
- That's true.

02:32.874 --> 02:34.790
I mean, what do you have
to lose by trying?

02:34.841 --> 02:36.008
I mean, what do I have
to lose?

02:36.043 --> 02:40.296
I... I don't know actually.

02:40.347 --> 02:44.050
<i>Elias was on board, but
he did have one major concern.</i>

02:44.101 --> 02:47.553
<i>I definitely could not afford
a lawsuit from Starbucks.</i>

02:47.555 --> 02:48.771
<i>Definitely not.</i>

02:48.805 --> 02:50.356
<i>Based off what I read on
Wikipedia,</i>

02:50.390 --> 02:52.608
<i>it seemed like my approach
was legal.</i>

02:53.021 --> 02:54.938
<i>But just to be sure,
I retained the services</i>

02:54.989 --> 02:58.442
<i>of attorney Peter J. Marx
to guarantee we were protected.</i>

02:58.493 --> 02:59.776
"Dumb Starbucks"?

02:59.778 --> 03:02.496
But the "Dumb" would be
smaller so people

03:02.530 --> 03:04.197
would still think
it's a Starbucks.

03:04.248 --> 03:06.700
If people think it's a
Starbucks, you've got a problem.

03:06.751 --> 03:08.535
It's not really a parody then.

03:08.586 --> 03:11.672
Apparently, my legal footing
wasn't as solid as I thought.

03:11.706 --> 03:14.925
But then Peter brought up one
way I could cover myself.

03:14.959 --> 03:18.545
Let's say you had a reputation
as being a--

03:18.596 --> 03:19.546
Yeah.

03:19.597 --> 03:21.014
someone who does
lots of parody.

03:21.049 --> 03:24.017
Then they know, oh, he's just
making fun of Starbucks,

03:24.052 --> 03:25.385
because this is what he does.

03:25.436 --> 03:27.137
So I have to become
a parody artist.

03:27.188 --> 03:28.472
It wouldn't hurt.

03:28.474 --> 03:30.190
It seemed like I still had
some work ahead of me.

03:30.224 --> 03:33.610
But before leaving, I needed
to be sure I was protected.

03:33.644 --> 03:36.480
So if I do all this,
then Starbucks can't sue me?

03:36.482 --> 03:37.647
This is America.

03:37.699 --> 03:39.316
People file lawsuits
at the drop of a hat.

03:39.318 --> 03:42.452
But if they sue,
you're liable too, right?

03:42.487 --> 03:43.904
- Who's liable?
- You.

03:43.955 --> 03:45.372
- Me personally?
- Yeah.

03:45.406 --> 03:47.624
Not unless I'm involved
in-- in viola--

03:47.658 --> 03:49.626
in infringing
their trademark, no.

03:49.660 --> 03:52.829
Yeah, the appearance release
you signed before had a clause

03:52.831 --> 03:55.582
that you would be liable too,
if Starbucks sued.

03:57.502 --> 04:00.003
I don't agree to this at all.

04:00.005 --> 04:01.722
I do not agree to pay
all legal fees and damages from

04:01.756 --> 04:03.223
legal action because
I have no control

04:03.257 --> 04:04.508
over what's being released.

04:04.510 --> 04:05.926
Well, why did you sign
that, then?

04:05.977 --> 04:07.561
Yeah, I signed it. And I
signed it because I didn't have

04:07.595 --> 04:08.895
a chance to read it
and I thought--

04:08.930 --> 04:10.097
But you're a lawyer.
Don't you read things

04:10.148 --> 04:11.515
- before you sign them?
- I do read things--

04:11.566 --> 04:13.683
I try to read things but you
wanted me to shoot and I glanced

04:13.735 --> 04:16.519
at it and this was my mistake.
I'll acknowledge that.

04:16.571 --> 04:18.939
Okay. Well, you signed it so I
guess you can give that back.

04:18.990 --> 04:21.024
Well, I-I'm not gonna give it
back because I'm going to--

04:21.075 --> 04:22.859
Well, I handed it to you just
to look over, but you already--

04:22.861 --> 04:24.327
No, I'm not gonna
give it back to you.

04:24.362 --> 04:27.030
I'm protecting myself and,
frankly, you from a nightmare.

04:27.081 --> 04:28.248
Well, you signed it.

04:28.282 --> 04:29.249
We have you on camera
signing it.

04:29.283 --> 04:30.500
So it still holds up in court.

04:30.535 --> 04:32.285
You don't have me on camera
signing it.

04:32.336 --> 04:33.787
Yes, we do.

04:33.838 --> 04:35.922
<i>What kind of lawyer am I?
Signing [bleep] I haven't read.</i>

04:35.957 --> 04:38.125
Well, if you do, that's fine
then you-- then you'll know

04:38.176 --> 04:40.427
how the terms--I'm gonna put it
in my pocket.

04:40.461 --> 04:41.628
Well, no, we don't want it
in your pocket.

04:41.679 --> 04:43.430
I-- We do want it
in my pocket.

04:43.464 --> 04:47.517
Please.
Please, you're in my office.

04:47.552 --> 04:49.186
I'm very serious. And I don't
know if you're really trying

04:49.220 --> 04:51.138
to do this just for the show,
but I'd like you

04:51.189 --> 04:53.774
to get off my desk and I'm gonna
ask you to leave the office.

04:53.808 --> 04:55.892
<i>I was disappointed that Peter
was trying to back out</i>

04:55.943 --> 04:57.477
<i>of the deal he signed.</i>

04:57.528 --> 04:59.446
<i>But our producers were
eventually able to calm him down</i>

04:59.480 --> 05:01.031
<i>enough to keep shooting.</i>

05:01.065 --> 05:03.400
They just said they need to
get a shot of the-- an insert

05:03.402 --> 05:04.901
of the document.
Like a shot of it.

05:04.952 --> 05:07.037
It's staying--
It's staying in my pocket.

05:07.071 --> 05:08.622
- It's not going anywhere.
- Well, we just need to get

05:08.664 --> 05:10.640
a shot of the clause
for the scene.

05:11.686 --> 05:13.237
- I-I--
- On the document.

05:13.271 --> 05:15.022
You can hold on to it.

05:15.073 --> 05:19.693
Just hold it out
like you'd had and then--yeah.

05:19.695 --> 05:21.028
This camera needs to get it
out here.

05:21.030 --> 05:22.329
Okay, that's how I had it.

05:22.364 --> 05:25.866
And then you can--

05:25.868 --> 05:29.870
just make sure you get an insert
of the actual--

05:29.872 --> 05:31.705
You know, I'm about to-- I
don't know if you're provoking

05:31.707 --> 05:35.509
me or not, but I'm-- I'm not--
I'm getting tired of this.

05:35.543 --> 05:38.262
I'm not gonna be responsible
for your conduct, okay?

05:38.296 --> 05:41.382
<i>My plan to have Peter share
liability didn't work.</i>

05:41.433 --> 05:43.684
<i>So it was more important
than ever that Elias and I</i>

05:43.718 --> 05:45.936
<i>take his guidance
to protect ourselves.</i>

05:45.971 --> 05:48.022
It would just be helpful,
legally, if we had a history

05:48.056 --> 05:50.641
of being parody artists.

05:50.692 --> 05:52.059
Okay.

05:52.110 --> 05:53.193
<i>I told him we'd only have
two weeks</i>

05:53.228 --> 05:55.479
<i>to make as big of a splash
as possible.</i>

05:55.530 --> 05:57.448
<i>So we got to work coming up
with some songs</i>

05:57.482 --> 05:59.650
<i>that we could perform
around town.</i>

05:59.701 --> 06:01.485
So the easiest thing that
anyone would recognize

06:01.536 --> 06:04.905
is a Stones song,
a Zeppelin song.

06:04.907 --> 06:07.207
Yeah, maybe we could, like,
skewer them for being old.

06:07.242 --> 06:09.743
Right.

06:09.745 --> 06:11.578
I can't get an erection,
but I try, but I try.

06:11.580 --> 06:13.497
Or something like that.
You know, I don't know.

06:13.548 --> 06:16.500
<i>We had our first song,
and after finishing the lyrics</i>

06:16.551 --> 06:19.003
<i>I booked us a spot
at a local open mic night</i>

06:19.054 --> 06:21.922
<i>so we could begin building
our legal defense.</i>

06:21.973 --> 06:26.927
Elias and I are big fans
of the Rolling Stones.

06:26.978 --> 06:29.596
But, you know, we were talking
lately and we thought

06:29.598 --> 06:34.601
"You know, these guys are kinda
getting a little old," so...

expressed some reservations.</i>

07:00.845 --> 07:03.964
Are you not confident
in the lyrics?

07:06.217 --> 07:07.301
Okay.

07:07.352 --> 07:09.636
<i>He was too nervous
to get on stage again.</i>

07:09.638 --> 07:11.472
<i>So after writing more songs,</i>

07:11.474 --> 07:14.274

the audience didn't agree.</i>

07:43.755 --> 07:45.089
I didn't really like that
at all.

07:45.140 --> 07:47.007
It's not really my cup of tea.

07:47.058 --> 07:48.642
He [bleep] sucked.

07:48.676 --> 07:51.228
<i>Maybe musical parody
just wasn't in style right now,</i>

07:51.262 --> 07:54.898
<i>because when I looked online, no
one was writing about my work.</i>

07:54.933 --> 07:57.151
<i>So I called Elias
with a change of plan.</i>

07:57.185 --> 08:01.355
I was thinking maybe, you know,
we move into some more visual

08:01.406 --> 08:04.691
parody and do, like,
a more formal art show.

08:07.445 --> 08:09.530
Are you saying that this is
not your priority right now?

08:09.532 --> 08:11.698
Or what are you saying?

08:13.918 --> 08:16.203
<i>Elias said he didn't have time
to help.</i>

08:16.254 --> 08:17.538
<i>But I knew this
was my last shot</i>

08:17.540 --> 08:19.540
<i>to become known
as a parody artist.</i>

08:19.542 --> 08:22.793
<i>So I spent the rest of the week
generating art pieces.</i>

08:22.844 --> 08:25.129
<i>And booked a gallery space
in a hip neighborhood</i>

08:25.180 --> 08:26.964
<i>to display my work.</i>

08:27.015 --> 08:29.716
<i>And after passing out flyers to
make sure I had a crowd...</i>

08:29.718 --> 08:31.101
- Friday night at 7:00?
- Yeah.

08:31.136 --> 08:32.135
I can make that.

08:32.187 --> 08:34.804
<i>my art show
was ready to begin.</i>

08:36.003 --> 08:37.965
<i>After putting the final
touches on my parody art,</i>

08:38.037 --> 08:40.886
<i>we opened our doors
and right away I could tell</i>

08:40.910 --> 08:42.342
<i>people were digging my work.</i>

08:42.393 --> 08:45.595
America being mostly about war
and Bank of America

08:45.597 --> 08:49.649
being about profits
and money as well, I just--

08:49.683 --> 08:51.067
I actually like that one.

08:51.101 --> 08:53.603
The meaning of this is
actually just, like, you know,

08:53.654 --> 08:57.273
you put your money in the bank.
It's really safe.

08:57.275 --> 08:58.691
Like a tank.

08:58.742 --> 09:00.109
Okay.

09:00.160 --> 09:02.862
I'm just curious, like,
what in your opinion

09:02.913 --> 09:05.782
makes this piece worth $2,500?

09:05.833 --> 09:08.117
Like, what did you put into it

09:08.119 --> 09:10.703
that would make it worth
that much?

09:10.754 --> 09:13.840
<i>Unlike my songs, my visual
pieces seemed to be making</i>

09:13.874 --> 09:15.925
<i>the impact I needed them to.</i>

09:15.959 --> 09:18.761
<i>As people were taking me
seriously as a parody artist...</i>

09:18.796 --> 09:21.381
Well, this catches my eye.
Yeah, I feel this.

09:21.432 --> 09:23.132
<i>the night was a success.</i>

09:23.183 --> 09:25.518
<i>And best of all,
I now had the evidence to argue</i>

09:25.552 --> 09:29.305
<i>that Dumb Starbucks was just
another one of my art pieces.</i>

09:29.356 --> 09:31.974
<i>But as the show was winding
down, I found myself frustrated</i>

09:32.026 --> 09:34.777
<i>that Elias didn't even bother
to show up.</i>

09:34.812 --> 09:37.563
<i>I was working night and day
to help his business</i>

09:37.614 --> 09:39.315
<i>and he didn't even seem
to care.</i>

09:39.366 --> 09:42.485
<i>But I wasn't gonna let an idea
this good go to waste.</i>

09:42.487 --> 09:46.296
<i>So the next day, I returned to
the Helio Cafe with my lawyer</i>

09:46.403 --> 09:47.681
<i>to make things fair.</i>

09:47.938 --> 09:51.140
Basically, as I understand it,
what Nathan has related to me,

09:51.191 --> 09:54.026
is that he has done
the lion's share of the work

09:54.060 --> 09:55.527
in setting up the business.

09:55.562 --> 09:57.730
Not only creating the concept,
coming up with it...

09:57.781 --> 10:00.115
<i>Peter went on to say
that Elias would no longer</i>

10:00.150 --> 10:02.234
<i>be a part of Dumb Starbucks,</i>

10:02.285 --> 10:04.486
<i>that I would be opening up
a new shop on my own,</i>

10:04.537 --> 10:06.739
<i>and that Elias
would be getting nothing.</i>

10:06.741 --> 10:08.240
Do you have any questions
of me at this time?

10:08.291 --> 10:11.460
I-- not-- not at this time.
Not at this time.

10:11.494 --> 10:13.212
<i>After severing ties
with Elias,</i>

10:13.246 --> 10:17.132
<i>I could now proceed without
his dead weight slowing me down.</i>

10:17.167 --> 10:19.918
<i>So I rented a vacant retail
space in Los Feliz, California,</i>

10:19.920 --> 10:23.172
<i>that would serve as the location
for the first Dumb Starbucks.</i>

10:23.223 --> 10:25.140
This reminds me of the metal
in my house.

10:25.175 --> 10:26.725
You have metal in your house
like that?

10:26.760 --> 10:28.227
- Yeah.
- Oh.

10:28.261 --> 10:29.595
<i>Construction began
immediately,</i>

10:29.646 --> 10:32.097
<i>and it would take at least
a week to build the shop.</i>

10:32.099 --> 10:34.600
<i>So in the meantime,
I posted an ad on Craigslist</i>

10:34.602 --> 10:37.569
<i>seeking baristas
with Starbucks experience.</i>

10:37.604 --> 10:39.271
<i>And after receiving
some responses,</i>

10:39.322 --> 10:42.107
<i>I met with the applicants
to see if they'd be a good fit.</i>

10:42.109 --> 10:43.909
When you're interacting with
customers, you know,

10:43.943 --> 10:45.778
it's important to have a good
sense of humor.

10:45.780 --> 10:46.829
Mm-hmm.

10:46.863 --> 10:48.864
Do you have
a good sense of humor?

10:48.915 --> 10:50.666
Yeah, I think so.

10:50.700 --> 10:52.785
So, let's see some of that.

10:52.787 --> 10:53.952
Hi.

10:54.004 --> 10:55.371
Hey, how's it going?
How's your day?

10:55.422 --> 10:57.172
Great.
Yeah, it's going well.

10:57.207 --> 10:58.624
It's going well?
How's the weather?

10:58.675 --> 11:00.459
- You enjoying the weather?
- Yeah.

11:00.510 --> 11:03.295
Yeah, that's cool.
I'm not.

11:03.346 --> 11:04.847
It's just too warm.

11:04.881 --> 11:06.548
And I'm getting over
a sickness too,

11:06.599 --> 11:09.635
so it's even more warm
than I'd like it to be.

11:09.637 --> 11:12.304
- That was funny.
- Yeah, thanks.

11:12.306 --> 11:13.889
<i>Jeremiah was perfect
for the job.</i>

11:13.940 --> 11:16.892
<i>I also hired Amber since we
seemed to have a lot in common.</i>

11:16.943 --> 11:19.361
What would you say
is your greatest weakness?

11:19.396 --> 11:22.314
My greatest weakness
is that I'm too nice.

11:22.316 --> 11:26.235
That's so funny, that's-- it--
that's my greatest weakness too.

11:26.286 --> 11:28.987
- Really?
- Yeah.

11:29.039 --> 11:31.824
<i>And with the store set to open
in less than 24 hours,</i>

11:31.875 --> 11:34.326
<i>my crew and I put
the final touches on making</i>

11:34.328 --> 11:37.996
<i>my parody Starbucks
look as authentic as possible.</i>

11:39.165 --> 11:41.333
<i>Before long,
everything was complete.</i>

11:41.384 --> 11:44.670
<i>And after giving Amber and
Jeremiah their official uniforms</i>

11:44.721 --> 11:47.172
<i>we had our first
employee orientation</i>

11:47.223 --> 11:49.425
<i>to go over
some company policies.</i>

11:49.476 --> 11:51.510
So because of the size
of the company,

11:51.561 --> 11:54.430
I am also
the HR department here.

11:54.481 --> 11:57.516
So we need to go over the code
of conduct when it comes to

11:57.518 --> 12:00.018
telationships in the workplace.

12:00.020 --> 12:03.072
The rule of thumb is,
if you begin dating

12:03.106 --> 12:06.909
another employee here,
it has to be reported to HR.

12:06.943 --> 12:10.279
Also, because sexual tension
is something

12:10.330 --> 12:12.164
that's very distracting
in the workplace,

12:12.198 --> 12:16.118
if you find yourself attracted
to another employee,

12:16.169 --> 12:19.088
that also needs to be disclosed.

12:19.122 --> 12:22.207
Um, Amber,
do you want to go first?

12:22.258 --> 12:25.043
Wow.
Okay.

12:25.045 --> 12:26.712
Well, I mean,
everybody's different.

12:26.763 --> 12:31.934
So, like, for me personally,
attraction is more than just--

12:31.968 --> 12:33.352
I mean, who out of the people
you work with

12:33.386 --> 12:36.555
are you attracted to
the most?

12:36.557 --> 12:37.890
Including bosses.

12:37.941 --> 12:40.526
Uh, wow.

12:40.560 --> 12:42.111
Okay, I'm gonna--
I'll go with you.

12:42.145 --> 12:44.113
- Me?
- Yeah.

12:44.147 --> 12:45.948
So out of everyone
you work with,

12:45.982 --> 12:47.983
you're most attracted to me?

12:48.034 --> 12:50.402
Right.
And you heard that, or--?

12:50.453 --> 12:52.988
Yeah, I heard that.
Yeah, loud and clear.

12:53.039 --> 12:56.074
So mine,
I guess would be you.

12:56.126 --> 12:59.128
And Jeremiah,
I guess, no one picked you.

12:59.162 --> 13:02.414
But, um, for the record I guess
I do need to know

13:02.416 --> 13:04.883
who you are most attracted to.

13:04.918 --> 13:08.253
Um, just say her.

13:08.304 --> 13:09.555
- Amber?
- Yeah.

13:09.589 --> 13:13.809
Okay, well, obviously,
you know, she did pick me--

13:13.843 --> 13:17.429
- Yeah.
- so that is unlikely to happen.

13:17.480 --> 13:20.599
But it's good that I do know
that for the record.

13:20.601 --> 13:22.684
And I think the fact that we've
talked about it,

13:22.735 --> 13:25.737
now we can continue working
as peers

13:25.772 --> 13:29.775
without there being
any awkwardness.

13:29.826 --> 13:31.193
Okay.

13:31.244 --> 13:33.328
<i>After our employee
orientation,</i>

13:33.363 --> 13:35.697
<i>I showed Amber and Jeremiah
around the shop.</i>

13:35.748 --> 13:37.332
<i>And got them acquainted
with all the items</i>

13:37.367 --> 13:39.451
<i>Dumb Starbucks has to offer.</i>

13:39.502 --> 13:40.536
<i>The only thing left to do</i>

13:40.587 --> 13:42.871
<i>was unveil our new sign
to the world.</i>

13:42.922 --> 13:43.872
- Ready?
- Yeah.

13:43.923 --> 13:45.874
- Ready.
- All right.

13:45.925 --> 13:47.926
Oh.

13:48.962 --> 13:52.047
Yay, all right.
Yeah.

13:52.098 --> 13:53.966
- Pretty good, huh?
- Yeah.

13:54.017 --> 13:55.621
<i>And with that,
Dumb Starbucks</i>

13:55.675 --> 13:57.885
<i>was officially
open for business.</i>

13:58.491 --> 14:01.841
<i>With our sign now on display,
my plan quickly began to work,</i>

14:01.875 --> 14:02.958
<i>as people started coming in</i>

14:02.960 --> 14:05.094
<i>thinking it was
an actual Starbucks.</i>

14:05.128 --> 14:08.130
Oh, Dumb Starbucks.
Okay, okay.

14:08.132 --> 14:09.131
Oh, you thought
it was Starbucks.

14:09.182 --> 14:10.599
I did.

14:10.634 --> 14:12.635
<i>But the few customers we did
get seemed to have trouble</i>

14:12.686 --> 14:14.637
<i>understanding what we were
all about.</i>

14:18.611 --> 14:20.580
I mean, legally speaking,

14:20.855 --> 14:25.296
this store has to be categorized
as an art gallery,

14:25.375 --> 14:29.328
so we don't have to abide
by the same health regulations

14:29.405 --> 14:30.772
as a Starbucks would.

14:36.501 --> 14:39.119
I mean, we don't want any of
our customers to get sick.

14:39.171 --> 14:40.671
But if they do,
technically,

14:40.705 --> 14:43.874
that's part of
the artistic experience.

14:44.960 --> 14:46.961
<i>Things were off
to an okay start.</i>

14:46.963 --> 14:49.129
<i>But as the day progressed,
I became frustrated</i>

14:49.131 --> 14:52.132
<i>we weren't getting the amount
of customers I expected.</i>

14:52.184 --> 14:54.351
<i>So I headed out to a nearby
coffee shop</i>

14:54.386 --> 14:56.804
<i>to try and spread the word
about my new business.</i>

14:56.855 --> 14:58.105
Just so you know,
there's a Dumb Starbucks

14:58.139 --> 14:59.640
that's opened up
down the block.

14:59.691 --> 15:01.025
- Okay.
- Okay.

15:01.059 --> 15:03.477
It's basically the same coffee.
Cheaper prices, and--

15:03.479 --> 15:04.778
- Dumb Starbucks?
- Yeah.

15:04.813 --> 15:07.398
Today, you know, you can have
a free coffee on me.

15:07.449 --> 15:09.116
I understand you're trying
to promote your company.

15:09.150 --> 15:10.818
- Right.
- I admire that.

15:10.820 --> 15:11.986
But that's great.
You can't do it on

15:12.037 --> 15:13.153
- Starbucks' property.
- And I admire you.

15:13.205 --> 15:14.822
- And I will be--
- And every time I step back,

15:14.824 --> 15:17.124
- you keep taking a step forward.
- No, I haven't moved.

15:17.158 --> 15:18.826
You have.
We started over here.

15:18.877 --> 15:20.327
No, we started right here.

15:20.329 --> 15:22.713
- But you need to walk that way.
- Okay, I will.

15:22.747 --> 15:25.499
<i>Unfortunately, my marketing
efforts were cut short.</i>

15:25.501 --> 15:30.254
<i>But I was at least able
to get some free supplies.</i>

15:30.305 --> 15:31.672
<i>With an underwhelming
launch day,</i>

15:31.723 --> 15:34.642
<i>I began to feel like I put in
all this effort for nothing.</i>

15:37.062 --> 15:39.780
<i>But the next morning
things changed.</i>

15:39.814 --> 15:41.432
<i>Jeremiah called me to say
there was a line</i>

15:41.483 --> 15:44.351
<i>of over 15 people at the store.</i>

15:44.353 --> 15:45.986
<i>Then I saw photos
of my shop posted</i>

15:46.021 --> 15:48.606
<i>on a straight body building
message board.</i>

15:48.657 --> 15:51.659
<i>But I couldn't have foreseen
what happened next.</i>

15:51.693 --> 15:53.360
A new coffee shop
with a familiar name

15:53.411 --> 15:55.529
creating quite a stir
in Los Angeles.

15:55.531 --> 15:59.617
The coffee shop-- get this--
is called Dumb Starbucks.

15:59.668 --> 16:01.535
That looks exactly
like a Starbucks.

16:01.586 --> 16:04.038
The logo, the lettering,
the green coloring--

16:04.089 --> 16:05.456
How do they get away
with this?

16:05.507 --> 16:07.925
Because they put the word
"Dumb" on top of Starbucks,

16:07.959 --> 16:09.343
so they're parodying
Starbucks.

16:09.377 --> 16:12.346
A coffee chain notorious
for suing imitators

16:12.380 --> 16:14.048
may have finally
met it's match.

16:14.099 --> 16:16.383
<i>At the counter, customers
can order a "Dumb Venti"</i>

16:16.385 --> 16:19.303
<i>Or buy a CD
of "Dumb Norah Jones Duets."</i>

16:19.354 --> 16:21.939
<i>Some people waited in line
for up to an hour.</i>

16:21.973 --> 16:24.892
It's an art gallery where
coffee is considered art.

16:24.894 --> 16:27.361
What's the point of the art?
I mean, what's the message?

16:27.395 --> 16:31.115
I don't know.

16:34.069 --> 16:35.235
<i>I was stunned.</i>

16:35.237 --> 16:38.322
<i>We had more customers
than I ever dreamed of.</i>

16:38.373 --> 16:40.574
<i>And within 24 hours,
Dumb Starbucks</i>

16:40.576 --> 16:42.793
<i>had become
a worldwide sensation.</i>

16:42.827 --> 16:44.578
Yeah, there's absolutely
artistic value here.

16:44.629 --> 16:46.380
To me, this is a protest.

16:46.414 --> 16:47.748
This is a protest
against the big fish.

16:47.799 --> 16:49.750
The leviathans of Starbucks.

16:49.801 --> 16:51.669
<i>It was cool that people
could draw their own meaning</i>

16:51.720 --> 16:54.471
<i>from a business that
was just there to make money.</i>

16:54.506 --> 16:56.724
There's a rumor
that it might be Banksy

16:56.758 --> 16:58.726
and we're all really excited
about that.

16:58.760 --> 17:00.978
<i>I had inadvertently
created something</i>

17:01.012 --> 17:04.181
<i>that was on par with one of
the world's greatest artists.</i>

17:04.232 --> 17:05.933
Something tied to an art
installation.

17:05.983 --> 17:07.483
Maybe this is Banksy.

17:07.519 --> 17:09.520
<i>Before I knew it,
cups from my shop</i>

17:09.570 --> 17:12.573
<i>were selling on eBay
for $500 a piece.</i>

17:12.607 --> 17:14.992
<i>And swindlers were even trying
to cash in on the hype</i>

17:15.026 --> 17:18.194
<i>by hocking fake merchandise
outside the store.</i>

17:18.246 --> 17:21.615
<i>By the end of the weekend
I realized that Dumb Starbucks</i>

17:21.617 --> 17:24.752
<i>was a bigger idea
than I ever thought it could be.</i>

17:24.786 --> 17:27.003
<i>So I gathered the worldwide
media to announce</i>

17:27.038 --> 17:28.956
<i>that we were expanding.</i>

17:30.459 --> 17:32.459
Hi.

17:32.461 --> 17:35.295
I'm proud to announce
that we'll soon be opening

17:35.297 --> 17:38.766
a second Dumb Starbucks location
in Brooklyn, New York,

17:38.800 --> 17:40.050
within the next two weeks.

17:42.971 --> 17:45.689
<i>My business was not only
a bona fide success,</i>

17:45.724 --> 17:47.558
<i>but for the first time
in my life</i>

17:47.609 --> 17:50.477
<i>It felt like people actually
wanted to be around me.</i>

17:50.528 --> 17:53.897
<i>Whatever I had done
resonated with the entire world.</i>

17:53.948 --> 17:56.817
<i>And the attention
was like sunlight on my soul.</i>

17:56.819 --> 17:58.986
My entire marketing plan
depended on using

17:58.988 --> 18:01.405
their corporate logo
to get attention.

18:01.456 --> 18:04.324
And the only way to legally do
it is by using "Dumb."

18:04.376 --> 18:07.661
<i>Every major network in America
wanted to know my story.</i>

18:07.663 --> 18:09.079
Nathan Fielder.

18:09.130 --> 18:10.547
<i>I was invincible.</i>

18:10.582 --> 18:14.334
<i>And I have to admit, the view
from the top was pretty nice.</i>

18:14.336 --> 18:16.470
We're also famous
for our pastries.

18:16.504 --> 18:18.389
I brought you some, actually.
- Oh, okay. Yeah, great.

18:18.423 --> 18:19.506
I brought some
of our pastries, yeah.

18:19.508 --> 18:21.475
Oh, those look great.

18:21.509 --> 18:23.143
What do you call these?
Are these those--

18:23.178 --> 18:24.478
- I brought muffins too.
- Oh, look at that.

18:24.512 --> 18:25.929
- These are our famous pastries.
- Isn't that weird.

18:25.980 --> 18:28.182
It says Vons on the side.

18:28.184 --> 18:31.351
<i>I was all smiles
and my head was in the clouds.</i>

18:31.353 --> 18:33.103
<i>Then all of a sudden,
reality hit.</i>

18:34.435 --> 18:36.896
The coffee shop called
"Dumb Starbucks"

18:36.947 --> 18:39.949
that popped up in Los Feliz
this weekend is now closed.

18:39.983 --> 18:41.856
The Los Angeles Health
Department shut down

18:41.894 --> 18:45.238
<i>Dumb Starbucks yesterday because
it did not have proper permits.</i>

18:45.289 --> 18:48.708
Right now, the future of
Dumb Starbucks isn't clear.

18:48.742 --> 18:51.411
<i>Being shut down by the Health
Department was the worst thing</i>

18:51.462 --> 18:53.413
<i>that could happen to me.</i>

18:53.415 --> 18:54.797
<i>I was at risk of losing
everything.</i>

18:54.832 --> 18:57.750
<i>And I realized that maybe I knew
less about running a coffee shop</i>

18:57.752 --> 18:59.419
<i>than I initially thought.</i>

18:59.421 --> 19:02.054
<i>But then I remembered,
there was one person I knew</i>

19:02.089 --> 19:04.140
<i>with the knowledge
to get me out of this.</i>

19:04.174 --> 19:07.477
I can do the training
and I can source the beans.

19:07.511 --> 19:09.762
The Health Department will have
to come in, do a plan check.

19:09.764 --> 19:11.431
- Okay.
- That I can do.

19:11.433 --> 19:13.266
<i>When I returned to Elias
to ask for his help</i>

19:13.268 --> 19:15.017
<i>he wanted nothing
to do with me.</i>

19:15.068 --> 19:18.771
So you think we're-- we're not
friends and we're not--

19:18.773 --> 19:21.908
My friends don't hire lawyers
to come and sign contracts.

19:21.942 --> 19:24.193
I thought--I thought
we were friends or--

19:24.244 --> 19:26.529
But my friends don't have
cameras and lights and lawyers.

19:26.580 --> 19:30.533
And producers.

19:30.584 --> 19:34.370
That's not how you establish
a friendship.

19:34.421 --> 19:36.956
<i>Elias' words hit me
like a ton of bricks.</i>

19:36.958 --> 19:40.793
<i>And in that moment, I realized
that in building Dumb Starbucks,</i>

19:40.795 --> 19:43.963
<i>I became someone
that I never wanted to be.</i>

19:43.965 --> 19:46.299
<i>I began all this trying to help
a struggling coffee shop</i>

19:46.350 --> 19:48.434
<i>gain recognition.</i>

19:48.469 --> 19:50.269
<i>And in my scramble
to make things work</i>

19:50.304 --> 19:52.104
<i>I put myself
before my fellow man,</i>

19:52.139 --> 19:54.273
<i>time and time again.</i>

19:54.308 --> 19:58.110
<i>In the end, I got everything
I could have ever dreamed of.</i>

19:58.145 --> 20:00.613
<i>But what does success mean
if the road that got you there</i>

20:00.647 --> 20:03.399
<i>is paved with broken hearts?</i>

20:03.450 --> 20:06.285
<i>They say that the devil
is an artist.</i>

20:06.320 --> 20:09.989
<i>And if that's so, then maybe I
was his greatest piece yet.</i>

20:09.991 --> 20:12.241
<i>So rather than fighting
the Health Department,</i>

20:12.292 --> 20:15.661
<i>I decided it was time
for Dumb Starbucks to end.</i>

20:15.712 --> 20:18.881
<i>It may have been impossible
to right every wrong,</i>

20:18.916 --> 20:21.501
<i>but it wasn't too late
to begin doing what was right.</i>

20:21.503 --> 20:24.971
Jeremiah, I'd like to give you
my blessing

20:25.005 --> 20:29.008
to pursue Amber,
if that's what you want.

20:29.059 --> 20:33.846
And whatever happens after that,
happens.

20:33.897 --> 20:36.516
Wow.
Okay.

20:36.567 --> 20:39.018
<i>Bringing people joy
is my true calling.</i>

20:39.069 --> 20:42.021
<i>I might have lost my opportunity
to help the Helio Cafe</i>

20:42.023 --> 20:43.656
<i>in the way I intended.</i>

20:43.690 --> 20:46.409
<i>But with the world's eye still
on me, I could at least</i>

20:46.443 --> 20:50.446
<i>draw their attention to the
place that needed it the most.</i>
