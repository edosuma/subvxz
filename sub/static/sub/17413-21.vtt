WEBVTT

00:02.372 --> 00:04.705
Okay, here are your strings.

00:04.708 --> 00:08.310
I'll ring up your trombone in a sec,
and yes, I'm the only one working here

00:08.312 --> 00:10.345
because my dad's too
cheap to hire more help.

00:11.714 --> 00:13.482
Guys, I've got great news.

00:13.484 --> 00:15.384
Time for an emergency
team Ally meeting.

00:15.386 --> 00:18.387
Can't it wait? I can't just leave
work whenever I feel like it.

00:21.290 --> 00:23.392
Oh, you're serious.

00:23.394 --> 00:25.460
No, it can't wait.

00:25.462 --> 00:26.828
I'll cover for you, Ally.

00:26.830 --> 00:28.463
Well, spit it out.

00:28.465 --> 00:29.765
What's the big news?

00:29.767 --> 00:32.768
Ally's song "redial"
sold so well,

00:32.770 --> 00:34.770
ramone records is moving
up the release date

00:34.772 --> 00:37.205
for her debut album
to next week!

00:37.207 --> 00:38.640
No way!

00:38.642 --> 00:39.908
My first album!

00:39.910 --> 00:41.576
You did it.

00:41.578 --> 00:42.878
I'm so proud of you.

00:43.913 --> 00:46.715
Aww.

00:46.717 --> 00:49.751
I love that you two
are a couple again.

00:52.922 --> 00:54.523
Okay!

00:57.951 --> 01:00.429
We should throw you a
record release party.

01:00.431 --> 01:01.656
Trish, can you plan it?

01:01.687 --> 01:04.266
Oh, sure. Plenty of
time to plan a party.

01:04.268 --> 01:07.235
It's not like like I'll be busy
setting up radio interviews,

01:07.237 --> 01:09.237
in-store appearances and
a photo shoot for Ally.

01:09.239 --> 01:10.305
Great, thanks.

01:11.908 --> 01:14.242
Wow. I'm gonna be busy.

01:14.244 --> 01:16.511
Between school and all
this album promotion,

01:16.513 --> 01:18.380
I'm barely gonna
have time for work.

01:18.382 --> 01:19.548
Yeah, about that.

01:19.550 --> 01:20.916
You're gonna have
to quit Sonic Boom.

01:20.918 --> 01:22.717
What?

01:22.719 --> 01:24.419
I can't quit working here.

01:24.421 --> 01:26.621
It's either quit here or
quit going to school.

01:29.592 --> 01:30.992
Oh, you're serious.

01:32.862 --> 01:33.929
Fine.

01:33.931 --> 01:36.298
I'll quit Sonic Boom.

01:36.300 --> 01:38.733
But it's gonna break
my dad's heart.

01:38.735 --> 01:42.471
Well, maybe it won't be so hard on him
if you find someone to replace you.

01:42.473 --> 01:45.440
What is Dez doing
behind the counter?

01:46.976 --> 01:49.411
Hope I didn't overcharge
that guy for the amp.

01:49.413 --> 01:51.046
We sell those for $200.

01:51.048 --> 01:52.914
Whoo, good. I didn't
overcharge him.

01:52.916 --> 01:54.449
I sold it to him for 10.

01:56.000 --> 02:02.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:52.942 --> 02:59.681
Fish tacos for Trish, and a crab
salad for my little ginger snap.

02:59.683 --> 03:01.049
What's wrong, babe?

03:01.051 --> 03:04.719
I'm afraid I'm gonna get fired
because I'm not a good waitress.

03:04.721 --> 03:06.788
What? You're a great waitress.

03:10.826 --> 03:14.529
Oh, you forgot the salad
dressing on the side.

03:15.798 --> 03:17.899
No, you didn't.

03:17.901 --> 03:20.402
I need to find a new job.

03:20.404 --> 03:23.672
If one more person asks me about
the fish special, I'm gonna cry.

03:23.674 --> 03:25.574
Hey, Carrie, how's
the fish special?

03:28.511 --> 03:30.011
Okay.

03:30.013 --> 03:32.013
Maybe I'll just get the salad.

03:32.015 --> 03:33.415
Sorry we're late.

03:33.417 --> 03:35.850
We just saw five
movies back to back.

03:35.852 --> 03:38.954
Since Ally's gonna be busy with her
record, we're squeezing a month of dates

03:38.956 --> 03:40.789
into one weekend.

03:40.791 --> 03:42.023
Next, we're going to
a poetry reading,

03:42.025 --> 03:43.959
then to Phil's fun town
to ride roller coasters.

03:43.961 --> 03:45.161
But we shouldn't eat too much.

03:45.162 --> 03:46.461
I don't want to yak.

03:46.463 --> 03:48.396
You don't get sick
on roller coasters.

03:48.398 --> 03:50.098
I was talking about
the poetry reading.

03:51.835 --> 03:54.936
So, Ally, did you talk to your dad
about you quitting Sonic Boom?

03:54.938 --> 03:56.504
Your album's being
released next week.

03:56.506 --> 03:57.872
Not yet.

03:57.874 --> 03:59.040
I'm not sure how to tell him.

03:59.042 --> 04:00.675
I'll talk to your dad.

04:00.677 --> 04:01.943
I know I'm his favorite.

04:01.945 --> 04:03.678
He has my picture
up in his office.

04:03.680 --> 04:05.981
That's a dart board.

04:05.983 --> 04:08.083
But it has my picture on it.

04:09.919 --> 04:12.887
So, Ally, let's go over a couple
things about your album release party.

04:12.889 --> 04:14.556
We're having it
here at shredders,

04:14.558 --> 04:17.024
and Jett Deely from VCL
is gonna interview you.

04:17.027 --> 04:18.827
That's great, Trish.

04:18.829 --> 04:20.962
I am gonna rock my
first album interview.

04:20.964 --> 04:22.964
I should probably
give you lessons.

04:22.966 --> 04:24.065
You have a tendency to ramble.

04:24.067 --> 04:25.834
I don't ramble.

04:25.836 --> 04:28.603
I mean, sometimes I talk a lot,
but that's only when I'm nervous.

04:28.605 --> 04:30.038
It started when I
was a little kid.

04:30.040 --> 04:32.741
Did you know that a baby
goat is also called a kid?

04:32.743 --> 04:35.777
Oh, and a baby kangaroo
is called a Joey.

04:35.779 --> 04:38.680
Yeah... You need lessons.

04:47.556 --> 04:48.823
Hey, honey.

04:48.825 --> 04:50.625
What do you think of
my new paintings?

04:50.627 --> 04:53.928
<i>A giraffe mowing the lawn,
a giraffe playing golf,</i>

04:53.930 --> 04:55.630
<i>a giraffe using the atm.</i>

04:55.632 --> 04:58.099
What do you call
this collection?

04:58.101 --> 05:02.871
"Giraffes doing people stuff."

05:02.873 --> 05:05.707
Huh. I never would have guessed.

05:06.776 --> 05:09.644
Dad, I have to talk to you.

05:09.646 --> 05:11.112
Ooh, is it about your new album?

05:11.114 --> 05:12.914
I am so happy for you.

05:12.916 --> 05:15.116
That's why you're
such a good dad.

05:15.118 --> 05:16.985
You're always happy for me.

05:16.987 --> 05:19.954
Never mad at me.

05:19.956 --> 05:22.824
Never ever mad at me.

05:22.826 --> 05:24.025
Oh, no.

05:24.027 --> 05:25.193
Did you wreck the car?

05:25.195 --> 05:27.495
No.

05:27.497 --> 05:30.632
I have to quit Sonic Boom.

05:30.634 --> 05:33.702
Oh, I am so glad to hear that.

05:34.724 --> 05:36.204
I really thought you
wrecked the car.

05:38.508 --> 05:40.075
Wait, you're not upset?

05:40.077 --> 05:41.509
Not at all.

05:41.511 --> 05:44.646
Now I can sell this place and
focus more time on my painting.

05:44.648 --> 05:46.548
Oh, I'm so glad to hear that.

05:46.550 --> 05:48.183
Wait, sell the store?

05:48.185 --> 05:50.518
Yeah, I've been thinking
about it for a while.

05:50.520 --> 05:52.921
I mean, you weren't gonna
work here forever.

05:52.923 --> 05:54.055
You're too talented.

05:54.057 --> 05:55.857
Thanks, dad.

05:55.859 --> 06:00.195
I guess I just thought you'd
never get rid of the store.

06:00.197 --> 06:04.299
I mean, I grew up here.

06:04.301 --> 06:06.835
I'm really gonna
miss this place.

06:06.837 --> 06:10.972
Do you want me to paint a picture of
a giraffe working at the register,

06:10.974 --> 06:12.207
so you'll always remember it?

06:13.976 --> 06:17.112
No, I'll just keep
my own memories.

06:31.694 --> 06:34.996
I can't believe my dad's
selling the store.

06:34.998 --> 06:37.031
We've had so many
good memories here.

06:37.033 --> 06:38.666
I know.

06:38.668 --> 06:40.869
Man, if these walls could talk.

06:40.871 --> 06:42.303
That'd be weird, right?

06:44.140 --> 06:46.975
Look, Ally, we're all
gonna miss Sonic Boom.

06:46.977 --> 06:48.777
But you shouldn't
be sad this week.

06:48.779 --> 06:52.147
Your album's coming out and we're
having a record release party for you.

06:52.149 --> 06:54.015
And don't forget, you have that
interview with Jett Deely.

06:54.017 --> 06:58.119
Remember, no rambling, focus on your
album, and no matter how upset you are,

06:58.121 --> 06:59.654
don't let Jett see it.

06:59.656 --> 07:02.090
I can keep it together. Try me.

07:04.326 --> 07:06.928
Welcome to VCL.

07:06.930 --> 07:10.331
I am Jett Deely here
with Ally Dawson.

07:10.333 --> 07:15.336
So, Ally... Tell me
about your new album.

07:15.338 --> 07:20.775
Well, Jett, it's got a lot of great
songs that I wrote here at Sonic Boom.

07:21.710 --> 07:24.312
Which my dad is selling.

07:24.314 --> 07:27.782
It's like he's throwing
away my childhood.

07:27.784 --> 07:30.952
Why is this happening to me?

07:30.954 --> 07:33.087
Way to keep it together.

07:34.790 --> 07:37.058
I just think my dad's
making a mistake.

07:37.060 --> 07:39.160
Then just tell him not
to sell the store.

07:39.162 --> 07:41.996
That's exactly
what I'm gonna do.

07:41.998 --> 07:44.132
I'm gonna stop my dad.

07:44.134 --> 07:46.167
Yeah. It's not too late.

07:46.169 --> 07:47.869
Great news, Ally.

07:47.871 --> 07:50.004
I sold the store.

07:50.006 --> 07:51.806
Okay, maybe it is too late.

08:01.650 --> 08:03.218
You sold the store?

08:03.220 --> 08:05.887
Yeah. We just have to
finalize some details.

08:05.889 --> 08:07.989
Meet the new owner, Ms. Krum.

08:07.991 --> 08:09.924
Oh, you must be Ally.

08:09.926 --> 08:12.660
Aren't you just
the cutest thing.

08:12.662 --> 08:15.763
And so much smarter
looking than I expected.

08:16.999 --> 08:18.700
What do you mean by that?

08:18.702 --> 08:21.002
Oh, it's just that
your father told me

08:21.004 --> 08:23.671
that you quit the store
to pursue your music.

08:23.673 --> 08:27.208
I just don't understand people who
follow their childish dreams,

08:27.210 --> 08:30.078
knowing they have almost
zero chance of success.

08:31.046 --> 08:32.413
Cookie?

08:35.217 --> 08:37.684
- Mmm!
- Delicious.

08:37.687 --> 08:38.886
But are they healthy?

08:38.889 --> 08:40.020
Oh, yes!

08:40.023 --> 08:42.823
They're made with oatmeal
and honey instead of sugar.

08:42.826 --> 08:44.158
Oh, you must be the smart one.

08:45.694 --> 08:47.262
He's not.

08:47.264 --> 08:51.232
I don't think my music
is a childish dream.

08:51.234 --> 08:53.868
Oh, I didn't mean to offend you.

08:53.870 --> 08:56.204
I'm just a more practical
kind of person.

08:56.206 --> 09:00.475
That's why I'm going to turn this
music store into a box store.

09:00.477 --> 09:03.244
A box store?!

09:03.246 --> 09:07.749
Look, Ms. Krum can do whatever she wants
with Sonic Boom after she buys it.

09:07.751 --> 09:11.419
I just can't believe this isn't
gonna be a music store anymore.

09:11.421 --> 09:12.754
Ooh.

09:12.756 --> 09:14.756
I hate music stores, dear.

09:14.758 --> 09:18.826
My parents forced me to take piano
lessons when I was a child,

09:18.828 --> 09:20.962
even though they
knew I hated it.

09:20.964 --> 09:23.164
"I like to bake, mommy!"

09:23.166 --> 09:25.833
"Shut up and play, Agnes."

09:27.202 --> 09:30.038
I don't want to do that
to other children.

09:30.040 --> 09:31.506
Is anybody else scared?

09:42.886 --> 09:45.820
I couldn't find a box big
enough for this bass.

09:45.822 --> 09:49.023
Why don't you use that big box?

09:49.025 --> 09:52.126
Because then I'll have nothing
to put the harmonica in.

10:01.171 --> 10:03.771
I'll just box up the
instruments myself.

10:05.174 --> 10:08.276
It's gonna be so hard saying
good-bye to this place.

10:08.278 --> 10:09.377
I know.

10:09.379 --> 10:10.878
I wrote all my songs here.

10:10.880 --> 10:12.880
We all became friends here.

10:12.882 --> 10:14.415
I met Ally here.

10:16.352 --> 10:18.486
And I met Trish here.

10:18.488 --> 10:21.089
Do you really want to walk
out of here with one hand?

10:22.024 --> 10:25.023
Some of the best times of our
lives happened at Sonic Boom.

10:50.987 --> 10:54.022
I'm not ready to say
good-bye to this place yet.

10:54.024 --> 10:58.259
Hey, why don't we have your record
release party here at Sonic Boom?

10:58.261 --> 11:00.662
That way we can have
one last great memory.

11:00.664 --> 11:02.030
- Yeah.
- Good idea.

11:02.032 --> 11:03.364
I'd like that, Trish.

11:03.366 --> 11:07.235
But it's not gonna be our last memory
here because I'm not giving up.

11:07.237 --> 11:08.836
What can we do?

11:08.838 --> 11:12.173
I don't know, but Ms. Krum
doesn't own the store yet.

11:12.175 --> 11:14.609
My dad said she's coming over
tonight to sign the papers.

11:14.611 --> 11:17.378
Then there's still time to convince your
dad not to go through with the sale.

11:17.380 --> 11:18.980
We can do it.

11:18.982 --> 11:20.448
We always come through
when we work together.

11:20.450 --> 11:21.983
Yeah.

11:21.985 --> 11:24.218
Dad, we don't think you
should sell Sonic Boom.

11:24.220 --> 11:26.421
And we're gonna put on a
play to show you why.

11:26.423 --> 11:30.558
Starting with the magical day
when you first bought the store.

11:30.560 --> 11:32.593
You know what was
magical about that day?

11:32.595 --> 11:33.995
I hadn't met you yet.

11:35.365 --> 11:38.599
It's that loving sarcasm that makes
me not afraid to call you dad.

11:38.601 --> 11:40.234
- Never call me that.
- Okay.

11:41.336 --> 11:43.037
Places, everybody.

11:43.039 --> 11:44.372
Showtime.

11:45.508 --> 11:51.579
Lester, my husband, are you sure
opening a music store is a good idea?

11:51.581 --> 11:54.382
I mean, we just had a baby.

11:54.384 --> 11:58.319
Wah, wah. I'm baby Ally.

11:59.254 --> 12:02.390
Penny, my wife, it's too late.

12:02.392 --> 12:05.059
I already signed the paperwork
without asking you,

12:05.061 --> 12:07.628
which, years later, will cause
problems in our marriage.

12:07.630 --> 12:10.331
Oh, that's true.
That's very true.

12:10.333 --> 12:12.233
Anyways, here's our
first customer.

12:14.169 --> 12:16.204
Thank you for the amp, Mr.
Dawson.

12:16.206 --> 12:18.506
I know I could get a better
deal over at music city,

12:18.508 --> 12:20.675
but they're closed today.

12:22.911 --> 12:25.513
We flash forward to Ally's
first piano lesson,

12:25.515 --> 12:28.082
where she shows her
first signs of talent.

12:31.054 --> 12:34.322
Wah. Not bad for a baby, huh?

12:36.125 --> 12:39.260
Ally continues to grow as a
musician and songwriter,

12:39.262 --> 12:43.498
and soon, she's the one
giving lessons at Sonic Boom.

12:43.500 --> 12:44.932
I'm Tommy.

12:44.934 --> 12:46.934
Ally taught me how
to play the tuba.

12:46.936 --> 12:48.536
I'm Sally.

12:48.538 --> 12:50.938
Ally taught me how
to play the flute.

12:50.940 --> 12:52.540
I'm Angus.

12:52.542 --> 12:55.209
Ally taught me how to
play these here bagpipes.

12:56.345 --> 13:00.948
And finally, after all those
years, Ally realized her dream.

13:02.618 --> 13:05.419
Ally, my daughter, is there
something you want to tell me?

13:05.421 --> 13:08.489
Dad, I got a record
deal at ramone records.

13:10.058 --> 13:12.660
My first album is coming out.

13:12.662 --> 13:15.396
And none of that would have
happened without Sonic Boom.

13:15.398 --> 13:18.232
You convinced me. I don't want
to sell the store anymore.

13:18.234 --> 13:20.735
Lester, I signed the paperwork.

13:20.737 --> 13:23.237
Sonic boom officially
belongs to me.

13:23.239 --> 13:27.074
Okay, Rudy, where shall we
bring in the wrecking ball?

13:27.076 --> 13:29.410
- Wrecking ball?
- Yes, dear.

13:29.412 --> 13:34.182
I'm going to demolish Sonic Boom
to build my box store. Cookie?

13:42.057 --> 13:45.493
Well, we should probably get ready
for Ally's record release party.

13:45.495 --> 13:47.395
We've only got a couple hours.

13:47.397 --> 13:51.332
It's so hard to celebrate when I
know Sonic Boom is being demolished.

13:52.669 --> 13:55.069
Maybe it's not too
late to save it.

13:55.071 --> 13:56.400
I just need to talk to Ms. Krum.

13:56.431 --> 13:59.140
Mm! If you talk to her, tell her
to bring over more cookies.

13:59.142 --> 14:01.075
We're almost out.

14:01.077 --> 14:04.412
Don't you feel bad knowing what that
lady is gonna do to Sonic Boom?

14:04.414 --> 14:05.746
No.

14:05.748 --> 14:07.148
Me either.

14:07.150 --> 14:09.250
They're awesome.

14:09.252 --> 14:13.221
Maybe if we just find something Ms.
Krum loves to do besides selling boxes,

14:13.223 --> 14:14.755
she won't need the store.

14:14.757 --> 14:16.757
We just have to come
up with what that is.

14:20.496 --> 14:22.096
This is so good.

14:24.399 --> 14:26.200
Guys, stop eating Ms.
Krum's cookies.

14:26.202 --> 14:27.735
We can't concentrate.

14:27.737 --> 14:29.403
That's it.

14:29.405 --> 14:31.405
She loves to bake cookies.

14:31.407 --> 14:33.307
I think I have an idea.

14:33.309 --> 14:35.610
Austin, come with me.
We've got calls to make.

14:35.612 --> 14:37.678
Trish, add Ms. Krum
to the guest list,

14:37.680 --> 14:39.513
and rent a big dessert
table for the party.

14:39.515 --> 14:41.549
- I'm on it.
- What should I do?

14:41.551 --> 14:43.818
You can help your
girlfriend find a new job.

14:43.820 --> 14:46.354
I just got fired for that.

14:48.590 --> 14:50.191
Ohh.

14:52.294 --> 14:54.795
Trish, you've had a job or
two, where should Carrie work?

14:54.797 --> 14:56.831
Oh, fine.

14:56.833 --> 14:59.166
I'll go through a list
of all my old jobs.

14:59.168 --> 15:01.435
Stop me if you
hear one you like.

15:01.437 --> 15:04.405

the mug store, yo-yo cart,

15:04.407 --> 15:07.341

greeting card store, cellphone accessory
cart, Suzy's soups, melody's diner,

15:15.685 --> 15:19.086
<i>mailbox store, halloweenatorium,
pillow store, Phil's fun town,</i>

15:19.088 --> 15:20.688

15:26.229 --> 15:30.097
caterer, radio dj, frozen yogurt
shop, shredders party planner.

15:30.099 --> 15:32.233
No.

15:45.447 --> 15:47.181
This party looks great, Trish.

15:47.183 --> 15:49.183
Thank you so much for
putting it together.

15:49.185 --> 15:52.887
Hey, when my client releases
an album, money is no object.

15:52.889 --> 15:55.556
Especially when it's the
record company's money.

15:55.558 --> 15:57.725
You ready for your
Jett Deely interview?

15:57.727 --> 15:58.960
Remember what we talked about.

15:58.962 --> 16:00.628
No rambling.

16:00.630 --> 16:01.896
What if he asks me about you?

16:01.898 --> 16:03.731
Should I say we're a couple?

16:03.733 --> 16:05.633
I don't want this
to be about me.

16:05.635 --> 16:07.268
I want this to be about you.

16:07.270 --> 16:09.170
Ally.

16:09.172 --> 16:11.172
Congrats on the debut album.

16:11.174 --> 16:12.506
So are you ready to
start our interview?

16:12.508 --> 16:13.607
Oh, not yet. I
just need a sec...

16:13.609 --> 16:14.775
And we're live.

16:14.777 --> 16:17.778
So, Ally, tell us what it was
like making your first record.

16:17.780 --> 16:21.716
It was a lot of work, Jett, but I think
my fans are really gonna love it.

16:21.718 --> 16:22.917
My favorite song is "parachute,"

16:22.919 --> 16:24.785
which I'll be playing
here tonight.

16:24.787 --> 16:28.155
Excellent. Now, that song wouldn't
be about anyone in particular,

16:28.157 --> 16:30.725
say your boyfriend?

16:30.727 --> 16:35.229
Oh, Jett, tonight's about my
music, not about my personal life.

16:35.231 --> 16:37.298
If my fans really want to
hear what's in my heart,

16:37.300 --> 16:39.600
they can buy my album
online starting tomorrow.

16:39.602 --> 16:40.901
Good to know.

16:40.903 --> 16:43.270
Hey, there's Ally's
partner, Austin moon.

16:43.272 --> 16:45.306
We're not partners.

16:45.308 --> 16:46.774
We're just friends.

16:46.776 --> 16:48.776
Sometimes we write
songs together.

16:48.778 --> 16:49.944
So I guess you could
call us partners.

16:49.946 --> 16:51.512
<i>Just not partners partners.</i>

16:51.514 --> 16:53.447
'Cause like I'm not
her boyfriend.

16:53.449 --> 16:56.217
Did you know a baby
goat's called a kid?

16:57.786 --> 16:58.426
Okay.

16:58.457 --> 17:00.988
We'll be right back
to see Ally perform.

17:02.258 --> 17:03.657
What the heck was that?

17:03.659 --> 17:05.593
You should take interview
lessons from her.

17:07.763 --> 17:09.195
What can I say?

17:09.198 --> 17:11.198
Some of us got it,
some of us don't.

17:12.367 --> 17:15.202
Thank you so much for inviting
me to your party, dear.

17:15.204 --> 17:17.838
I love to watch people
eat my cookies.

17:17.839 --> 17:19.906
You know what you should do?

17:19.909 --> 17:24.244
Forget the box store and
open up a food truck.

17:24.247 --> 17:26.914
That's a great idea, Austin.

17:26.915 --> 17:30.251
But where oh where will
she find a food truck?

17:30.253 --> 17:31.786
Oh, I know.

17:31.788 --> 17:34.989
The burger guy in the parking
lot is selling his truck.

17:34.991 --> 17:38.259
But where oh where will
we find his number?

17:38.261 --> 17:40.928
Oh, I know.

17:40.930 --> 17:42.630
I have his card.

17:43.965 --> 17:47.268
But where oh where will she
find a phone to call him with?

17:47.270 --> 17:48.736
Oh, I know.

17:48.738 --> 17:50.471
Man.

17:50.473 --> 17:51.972
I left my phone in
my other pants.

17:51.974 --> 17:53.574
Milk?

17:53.576 --> 17:57.445
Oh, I see what you
kids are doing.

17:57.447 --> 18:01.048
You want me to sell Sonic
Boom back to Lester.

18:01.050 --> 18:04.919
Do you think I am foolish enough to
give up the security of a box store

18:04.921 --> 18:08.255
to pursue my childish
dreams of selling cookies?

18:08.257 --> 18:10.291
That's what we were
kind of hoping.

18:10.293 --> 18:12.660
Well, it's not gonna work.

18:12.662 --> 18:13.994
I will take the milk, however.

18:13.996 --> 18:15.930
That'll go good
with the cookies.

18:15.932 --> 18:18.933
We tried.

18:18.935 --> 18:20.968
Sorry, Ally.

18:20.970 --> 18:22.603
Hey...

18:22.605 --> 18:25.406
This is the biggest
night of my life.

18:25.408 --> 18:26.974
We shouldn't be sad.

18:26.976 --> 18:27.656
You're right.

18:27.687 --> 18:30.407
Come on. It's time
for you to perform.

18:33.014 --> 18:35.483
There are a few people I want
to thank for this night.

18:35.485 --> 18:39.920
My friends, and most
importantly, my dad,

18:39.922 --> 18:43.591
who always encouraged
me to follow my dreams.

20:10.045 --> 20:12.146
That was wonderful, dear.

20:12.148 --> 20:13.480
See, Ms. Krum?

20:13.482 --> 20:15.015
Dreams do come true.

20:15.017 --> 20:17.017
Oh, yeah, sure.

20:17.019 --> 20:19.820
We should all just quit
our practical jobs

20:19.822 --> 20:23.390
in order to pursue our childish
dreams because it feels good.

20:24.693 --> 20:26.961
Well...

20:26.963 --> 20:29.964
That's exactly
what I'm gonna do!

20:29.966 --> 20:33.434
I'm going into the
cookie business!

20:33.436 --> 20:35.436
<i>- Lester!
- Yeah?</i>

20:35.438 --> 20:37.871
You can have the store back.

20:43.812 --> 20:46.080
Now I just need someone
to work here for Ally.

20:46.082 --> 20:48.482
I've got just the person.

20:48.484 --> 20:49.683
Right, Carrie?

20:49.685 --> 20:51.418
Oh, yeah.

20:51.420 --> 20:53.520
Trish, I think he means you.

20:54.889 --> 20:56.590
Maybe I should do the talking.

20:59.027 --> 21:00.661
You got the store back.

21:00.663 --> 21:02.997
Now it's really the
happiest night of my life.

21:05.000 --> 21:06.500
Uh...

21:07.970 --> 21:10.904
So I'm just gonna go
get a cookie now.

21:15.510 --> 21:17.144
I'm really proud of you, honey.

21:17.146 --> 21:17.873
Thanks, dad.

21:17.904 --> 21:20.781
Sorry you can't retire
to paint your giraffes.

21:20.783 --> 21:21.949
Oh, that's okay.

21:21.951 --> 21:23.817
I could still sell them
here at the store.

21:23.819 --> 21:27.955
Ooh, and I hired Carrie to work here while
you were busy promoting your album.

21:27.957 --> 21:29.657
You sure that's a good idea?

21:29.659 --> 21:31.592
Yeah, she knows
what she's doing.

21:31.594 --> 21:33.594
What instrument is this?

21:33.596 --> 21:35.796
It's a cash register.

21:35.798 --> 21:37.831
I figured out how to play it.

21:43.838 --> 21:46.073
I'm glad we got Sonic
Boom back, dad.

21:46.075 --> 21:47.241
Me too, honey.

21:49.078 --> 21:50.511
Oh, dear!

21:50.513 --> 21:52.846
I forgot to call off
the wrecking ball!

21:52.848 --> 21:55.516
Run for your lives!

22:16.504 --> 22:18.038
My giraffes!

22:23.978 --> 22:25.045
Cookie?
