for my sinister handiwork.

on! Hey!

17:37.348 --> 17:39.589
Aah! Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

17:39.725 --> 17:41.966
Sheila, clean yourself up and go upstairs.

17:42.103 --> 17:43.889
Our guests have been asking questions.

17:44.021 --> 17:47.980
We'll discuss this matter
after I've disposed of this pest.

17:48.109 --> 17:50.646
I'm not coming back
to the party, Hamilton.

17:50.778 --> 17:52.894
I'm not coming back ever!

17:53.030 --> 17:54.395
I'm gonna work with the--

17:54.532 --> 17:56.489
Is there a problem, Mr. Limb?

17:56.617 --> 17:58.153
Uh,no,no.

17:58.286 --> 18:00.072
No problem, my lieges.

18:00.204 --> 18:02.696
Merely saying good night to my guests.

18:02.832 --> 18:05.073
Yeah, I'm gonna give
Queen Etheria a ride.

18:05.209 --> 18:06.290
Very well.

18:06.419 --> 18:09.662
Please be quick about it.
Councilman 1O is getting drowsy.

18:09.797 --> 18:11.253
I shall.

18:11.382 --> 18:14.044
[Chuckles ] Well, good night, fellas.

18:14.176 --> 18:15.917
Good night, Sparky.

18:16.053 --> 18:18.841
What is your name,
you insolent little nobody?

18:18.973 --> 18:22.136
Why I'm the mighty... M-m-m...

18:22.268 --> 18:23.679
Man-otaur!

18:23.811 --> 18:26.143
Then let this be a warning to you...

18:26.272 --> 18:27.558
Man-otaur.

18:27.690 --> 18:30.978
You're hereby officially
on the Phantom Limb's shit list.

18:31.110 --> 18:32.726
And from this night forward...

18:32.862 --> 18:36.730
my primary focus in life
will be to destroy you.

18:36.866 --> 18:37.947
Shadowmen!

18:38.075 --> 18:41.284
Oh, yeah? Well, you'll have to find me first.

18:41.412 --> 18:44.029
That is, if you can make it through...

18:44.165 --> 18:47.703
my Mmm-Malevolent Murder Maze.

18:47.835 --> 18:50.702
[Laughs] Eh...

18:50.838 --> 18:53.580
Wait. Take me with you.

18:53.716 --> 18:55.878
Well, you said you wanted
lots of henchmen.

18:56.010 --> 18:57.216
Uh, that's 9.

18:57.345 --> 18:59.131
The one I told you about--
with the staring.

18:59.263 --> 19:00.378
Sorry, man.

19:01.599 --> 19:03.636
W-wait.
Did that video have a wipe?

19:03.768 --> 19:05.884
Councilman 3 got Adobe premiere.

19:06.020 --> 19:07.101
Was it too showy?

19:07.229 --> 19:09.641
I thought it would make
the scene more lively.

19:09.774 --> 19:11.481
- And Why'd you change the music?
- Pardon?

19:11.609 --> 19:13.896
Listen, a man remembers
what's on his car radio...

19:14.028 --> 19:15.939
the first time he taps his future wife.

19:16.072 --> 19:17.233
That was not the song.

19:17.365 --> 19:18.981
Uh, we couldn't afford the rights.

19:19.116 --> 19:20.197
Einar was ready to sign...

19:20.326 --> 19:22.988
but Bjork's lawyers
just would not budge.

19:23.120 --> 19:24.235
Well, that proves it.

19:24.372 --> 19:26.579
Are you gonna tell me
that Phantom Limb is so stupid...

19:26.707 --> 19:28.414
that he couldn't recognize
his own henchman...

19:28.542 --> 19:30.408
or that he's so dim that later...

19:30.544 --> 19:31.500
when he met the Monarch...

19:31.629 --> 19:33.245
he couldn't put two and two together?

19:33.381 --> 19:35.418
It does seem far-fetched.

19:35.549 --> 19:37.335
Nobody's that thickheaded.

19:37.468 --> 19:40.130
Clearly, Phantom Limb
is responsible for this.

19:40.262 --> 19:43.755
He's the one who hid the Monarch's
illicit activity from the Guild.

19:43.891 --> 19:47.384
The Monarch-- he's innocent
of everything but ignorance.

19:47.520 --> 19:48.555
[ Monitors power down ]

19:50.314 --> 19:51.520
Hi, honey.

19:51.649 --> 19:53.856
I think I'm gonna be dipped in lava.

19:53.984 --> 19:56.521
Monarch, I'm sorry.

19:56.654 --> 19:59.772
That's what you should've
told me in the escape pod.

19:59.907 --> 20:01.113
[ Monitors power up ]

20:01.242 --> 20:02.152
BOTH: Sovereign!

20:02.284 --> 20:03.274
It's David Bowie.

20:03.411 --> 20:07.746
The Council of 13
have made their decision.

20:08.916 --> 20:10.077
Man, what's happening?

20:10.209 --> 20:11.574
Well, they're just talking.

20:11.711 --> 20:14.453
Maybe Brock knows
how to kill with words.

20:14.588 --> 20:16.670
Maybe his name is a killing word.

20:16.799 --> 20:17.789
Wait, wait, wait.

20:17.925 --> 20:19.165
Now he's shaking their hands.

20:19.301 --> 20:20.211
Why would he do that?

20:20.344 --> 20:22.085
Marquess of Queensberry rules.

20:22.221 --> 20:23.962
Oh, wait. No.
Now he's picking up a hammer.

20:24.098 --> 20:25.259
This is gonna be good.

20:25.391 --> 20:26.802
I don't see Tim-Tom, though.

20:26.934 --> 20:28.095
Where the hell?

20:28.227 --> 20:29.388
Did Brock smush him already?

20:29.520 --> 20:30.476
No.

20:30.604 --> 20:32.345
He-- he's right here.

20:32.481 --> 20:35.189
Was you the one who called for help, 21?

20:35.317 --> 20:36.603
Uh,no,no.

20:36.736 --> 20:37.771
Uh, no, I was not.

20:37.903 --> 20:39.314
- That was all him.
- Dude, why?

20:39.447 --> 20:40.812
Good idea, chump.

20:40.948 --> 20:44.612
What say we call a few more
of your old pals?

21:12.772 --> 21:16.515
You have been tested in mutual combat
against our slaughterbots.

21:16.650 --> 21:19.893
You have proved your romantic
and professional compatibility...

21:20.029 --> 21:22.737
and you have even proved
the Monarch's innocence.

21:22.865 --> 21:25.573
Your trial is thus concluded.

21:25.701 --> 21:27.863
Now join hands.

21:28.704 --> 21:31.036
Monarch, Dr. Girlfriend...

21:31.165 --> 21:33.452
the Guild of Calamitous Intent...

21:33.584 --> 21:37.168
hereby approves
your application for Duoship.

21:37.296 --> 21:40.880
I now pronounce you
Villain and Villainess.

21:41.008 --> 21:42.794
You may kiss your queen.

21:42.927 --> 21:44.088
[Applause ]

21:58.901 --> 21:59.982
Aah! Aah! Aah! Aah! Aah!

22:00.110 --> 22:01.521
Bring it, bitch! Bring it!

22:01.654 --> 22:05.192
In accordance
with the Guild's Edict of Usurpation...

22:05.324 --> 22:10.569
you must now complete your first
mission together.

Minions, attack!

Show no mercy!

- Monarch.
- What?!

22:29.723 --> 22:30.929
Excuse me?

22:31.058 --> 22:33.174
Oh. Sorry, pookums.

22:33.310 --> 22:35.426
Welcome home.

22:35.563 --> 22:36.553
Great.

22:36.689 --> 22:38.305
You deployed
my wings with your ass.

PHANTOM LIMB: Did you really think
I'd forget about you, old man?

23:13.809 --> 23:16.471
OLD MAN:
What is this, some kind of revenge trip?

23:16.604 --> 23:18.515
I retired from all that villainy crap.

23:18.647 --> 23:20.137
No one retires...

from the Phantom Limb's shit list.
