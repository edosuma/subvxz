<i>So tell me how this works.</i>

00:04.188 --> 00:05.990
<i>I'm awake with my
wife, and I close my eyes.</i>

00:06.024 --> 00:07.241
<i>I open them.</i>

00:07.292 --> 00:08.576
<i>I'm awake with my son.</i>

00:08.627 --> 00:11.078
And this has been happening
since the accident?

00:12.747 --> 00:16.166
<i>So you begin working on
one case here in reality,</i>

00:16.200 --> 00:18.836
<i>and then, suddenly,</i>
<i>you begin working another case</i>

00:18.870 --> 00:20.804
<i>there, in your dream.</i>

00:20.839 --> 00:23.007
<i>It all feels
completely real to me.</i>

00:23.041 --> 00:25.092
You can't tell whether
you're awake or asleep

00:25.143 --> 00:26.176
at this very moment?

00:26.210 --> 00:27.261
<i>Well, I can assure you,</i>

00:27.312 --> 00:29.146
Detective Britten,
this is not a dream.

00:29.180 --> 00:31.765
That's exactly what
the other shrink said.

00:33.865 --> 00:35.965

You're always like a statue.

00:59.577 --> 01:02.129
Never seen anyone
hold so still.

01:03.348 --> 01:05.299
One thing I've learned
is patience.

01:07.936 --> 01:10.187
See you next week.

01:10.221 --> 01:12.356
Maybe not.

01:12.390 --> 01:13.524
Maybe I'll get lucky.

01:13.558 --> 01:15.943
Yeah? Who's going to give
you a kidney?

01:15.977 --> 01:18.479
They don't put prisoners
on no donor lists.

01:18.530 --> 01:20.280
A man can dream, can't he?

01:20.315 --> 01:21.315
Yeah?

01:21.366 --> 01:22.533
Keep dreaming.

01:25.537 --> 01:27.037
Who do you think
you are, Cooper?

01:27.072 --> 01:28.622
My mother has to wait

01:28.657 --> 01:30.290
three months to see a doctor,

01:30.325 --> 01:32.493
and here you are,

01:32.544 --> 01:34.078
sucking the taxpayers' money.

01:48.727 --> 01:50.978
All right, let's go.

02:00.572 --> 02:01.605
Shut the door.

02:01.639 --> 02:03.323
Come on.

02:03.358 --> 02:04.742
Shut it!

02:04.776 --> 02:06.410
I got nothing to lose, Perez.

02:06.444 --> 02:09.113
You don't want to test a
man with nothing to lose.

02:10.481 --> 02:11.532
Huh?

02:11.583 --> 02:12.833
Shut it!

02:19.524 --> 02:20.758
Nerves are good
before a tournament.

02:20.792 --> 02:22.092
But you're going to do great.

02:22.127 --> 02:23.594
Hey, Tara.

02:23.628 --> 02:25.295
Just watching this,
uh, kid here...

02:25.329 --> 02:26.914
the favorite
for the tournament.

02:26.948 --> 02:28.315
He's pretty good.

02:28.349 --> 02:29.550
Good?

02:29.601 --> 02:30.984
He's ranked like
15th in the state.

02:31.019 --> 02:32.636
I was telling Rex,
he can beat him

02:32.670 --> 02:34.054
if he keeps him
behind the baseline...

02:34.089 --> 02:35.556
I already have a coach, Dad.

02:35.607 --> 02:37.424
Which is why I'm thinking you
really don't need to be there.

02:37.459 --> 02:38.809
I don't need to be there.

02:38.843 --> 02:40.144
- I want to be there.
- Why?

02:40.178 --> 02:41.228
So you can watch me lose?

02:43.815 --> 02:44.982
Oh.

02:45.016 --> 02:46.533
- Sorry.
- Yeah.

02:46.568 --> 02:47.785
Britten.

02:47.819 --> 02:49.236
Since when do
you have a problem

02:49.287 --> 02:50.370
with your dad
watching you play?

02:50.405 --> 02:52.039
From where?

02:52.073 --> 02:54.241
Uh-huh.
- His serve's, like, 100 miles an hour.

02:54.292 --> 02:56.610
I mean, how am I
supposed to return that?

02:56.644 --> 02:57.878
When did this happen?

02:57.912 --> 02:59.163
Five hours ago.

02:59.197 --> 03:00.464
CHP just flagged him

03:00.498 --> 03:02.716
on a traffic camera
heading south on the 405.

03:02.751 --> 03:05.169
Which means he may be
in the L.A. area.

03:05.203 --> 03:07.721
Captain's putting together
a fugitive task force,

03:07.756 --> 03:09.673
you know, to check out
all his known contacts.

03:09.707 --> 03:10.758
Some story.

03:10.809 --> 03:12.542
Guy's 14-year-old son ODs,

03:12.560 --> 03:14.812
he shoots the dealer
and gets life in prison.

03:14.846 --> 03:16.379
Wait.

03:16.397 --> 03:19.266
Is this guy's name, uh...

03:19.317 --> 03:21.101
Cooper... John Cooper?

03:21.152 --> 03:23.237
Yeah. How'd you know that?

03:23.271 --> 03:23.929
I made the arrest.

03:23.930 --> 03:26.890
All you have to do is block it.
Get your racquet on the ball,

03:26.908 --> 03:28.442
- and you'll be in the point.
- I'll see you there.

03:28.476 --> 03:32.329
Something came up... work.
I'm sorry.

03:32.363 --> 03:35.165
But, uh, if you make the final,
it's-it's Sunday, right?

03:35.200 --> 03:36.750
I should be able
to be there by Sunday.

03:36.785 --> 03:38.952
That'd be great.

03:40.238 --> 03:42.206
Don't get so broken up.

03:42.240 --> 03:44.792
Already said you didn't
have to come, so it's fine.

03:44.843 --> 03:46.627
Call me when you get there.

04:00.725 --> 04:01.942
Sign right here.

04:01.976 --> 04:03.093
Jim.

04:03.111 --> 04:04.728
Hey.
It's okay.

04:06.197 --> 04:08.482
Good to see you, Michael.

04:08.533 --> 04:10.234
Hey. How you holding up?

04:10.268 --> 04:12.486
Yeah, I'm... I'm good.

04:12.537 --> 04:13.737
Mm-hmm.

04:13.771 --> 04:15.038
How's Rex?

04:15.073 --> 04:16.990
Uh... he's
playing tennis.

04:17.041 --> 04:18.375
He's in a tournament
this weekend.

04:18.409 --> 04:20.327
I should be there, but, uh...

04:20.378 --> 04:21.795
Bet he's good.

04:21.829 --> 04:23.163
I remember how good Hannah was.

04:23.214 --> 04:24.581
Kicked your ass.

04:25.783 --> 04:27.634
So thanks for coming in
on such short notice.

04:27.669 --> 04:29.169
Well, this was my case, too.

04:29.220 --> 04:31.505
I would have been pissed
if you hadn't called me.

04:31.556 --> 04:32.789
All right.

04:32.807 --> 04:35.526
Let's get to the manhunt,
like the old days.

04:37.628 --> 04:41.098
So... how did Cooper
pull this off?

04:41.132 --> 04:44.151
Uh, he escaped after
off-site dialysis treatment.

04:44.185 --> 04:46.236
Used a paralytic on a guard.

04:46.271 --> 04:47.988
Think he got it
from the inside?

04:48.022 --> 04:49.356
Grilling the staff right now.

04:49.407 --> 04:50.807
Hey, you want to meet
your predecessor?

04:50.825 --> 04:53.476
It's the guy I was stuck with
before I was stuck with you.

04:53.494 --> 04:54.912
Jim, good to see
you again, man.

04:54.946 --> 04:56.246
Good to see you, Bird.

04:56.281 --> 04:58.148
You know each other?

04:58.166 --> 05:00.250
We met.

05:01.502 --> 05:03.620
Hannah's funeral.

05:09.260 --> 05:12.179
- Hey.
- Hey there, sweaty man.

05:13.381 --> 05:15.098
Hey, you want breakfast?

05:15.133 --> 05:17.267
I want to take a shower first.

05:17.302 --> 05:20.220
Hey, uh... hey, want
to shower with me?

05:20.271 --> 05:21.438
Save water?

05:21.472 --> 05:23.190
Ah, for the sake
of the environment.

05:27.145 --> 05:28.528
David called.

05:28.563 --> 05:31.281
Talked about the
fundraiser tomorrow.

05:31.316 --> 05:33.734
I thought we told him
we weren't going.

05:33.785 --> 05:35.569
Yeah, we did.

05:35.620 --> 05:38.872
The board is hiring
a new crisis counselor,

05:38.907 --> 05:41.041
and they're going to name
the position in Rex's honor.

05:41.075 --> 05:42.993
Wow. That's nice.

05:43.027 --> 05:44.194
Yeah.

05:44.212 --> 05:45.879
Place was important
to him, you know?

05:45.914 --> 05:48.649
Volunteered there
three times a week.

05:49.851 --> 05:51.802
What?

05:52.837 --> 05:55.422
I don't know, sweetie.

05:55.473 --> 05:58.008
You sure you're up for it?

05:59.477 --> 06:02.813
No. I just thought...
it's going to be hard,

06:02.847 --> 06:06.483
but they're doing a whole
memorial program for Rex.

06:06.517 --> 06:09.136
I feel like we should be there.

06:09.170 --> 06:12.105
<i>So how did you resolve
this with Hannah?</i>

06:12.156 --> 06:13.440
Well, how do you think?

06:13.491 --> 06:14.775
We're going to the fundraiser.

06:14.826 --> 06:16.944
And how do you feel about that?

06:16.995 --> 06:18.912
How do I feel?

06:18.947 --> 06:21.564
I-I just don't want her
to get hurt.

06:21.582 --> 06:23.450
I want to protect her.

06:23.501 --> 06:25.085
Have you considered
that maybe you want

06:25.119 --> 06:26.653
to protect something else?

06:26.688 --> 06:28.839
Like what?

06:28.873 --> 06:31.875
This dream of your son
being alive.

06:31.909 --> 06:35.212
This event that you're
so reluctant to attend,

06:35.246 --> 06:38.548
it's all about
commemorating Rex.

06:38.582 --> 06:42.469
But how can you expect
to memorialize a son whose death

06:42.520 --> 06:44.972
you haven't truly accepted?

06:47.025 --> 06:49.059
So, Rex, was that
really about not wanting

06:49.093 --> 06:50.444
your dad to see you play,

06:50.478 --> 06:52.896
or were you just giving
him a hard time?

06:55.083 --> 06:57.734
If you don't want to talk
about it, that's okay, too.

06:59.320 --> 07:01.288
He tries too hard.

07:01.322 --> 07:05.792
He always wants to...
talk and hang out

07:05.827 --> 07:08.628
like we're best friends
or something.

07:08.663 --> 07:10.380
This is your complaint?

07:11.799 --> 07:15.002
I just don't want to deal
with him right now.

07:15.053 --> 07:18.005
He almost lost you.

07:18.056 --> 07:19.806
I think you can handle
a few hugs

07:19.841 --> 07:21.391
and some awkward conversation.

07:21.426 --> 07:23.727
He's not the problem.

07:24.846 --> 07:26.480
I am.

07:26.514 --> 07:28.565
What does that mean?

07:28.599 --> 07:30.684
It means I'm a terrible person.

07:30.735 --> 07:33.153
You're not terrible;
You're a teenager. It's...

07:33.187 --> 07:36.440
When it's just
the two of us and he's

07:36.474 --> 07:38.942
asking me about my day,
making my dinner,

07:38.976 --> 07:41.578
trying to talk about sports,

07:41.612 --> 07:45.148
being nothing but nice to me...

07:48.252 --> 07:51.538
I can't stop thinking that...

07:51.589 --> 07:53.840
I wish I had her instead of him.

07:54.876 --> 07:56.543
What kind of person

07:56.594 --> 08:02.132
looks someone in the eye,
someone who's trying so hard...

08:02.166 --> 08:06.136
and wishes they were dead
instead of someone else?

08:08.806 --> 08:11.641
Every time he smiles at me,
every time he hugs me

08:11.675 --> 08:14.978
and says he loves me...

08:16.364 --> 08:20.534
I'm-I'm afraid
he's going to see that...

08:20.568 --> 08:23.236
I didn't choose him.

08:26.357 --> 08:28.742
That I want her instead.

08:28.793 --> 08:32.879
Having those feelings
doesn't make you a bad person.

08:32.914 --> 08:35.048
There's no right
way or wrong way

08:35.082 --> 08:36.716
to feel about what's happened.

08:36.751 --> 08:38.335
But whatever you're feeling,

08:38.369 --> 08:40.703
you shouldn't have to
keep it to yourself.

08:40.721 --> 08:43.039
So it's good
that you're telling me.

08:54.769 --> 08:56.069
What the hell?

08:56.104 --> 08:57.387
You okay?

08:58.656 --> 09:00.774
I'm fine.

09:01.826 --> 09:03.360
All right. Stay here.

09:03.394 --> 09:05.529
Be right back.

09:14.288 --> 09:16.206
It's not too bad.

09:16.240 --> 09:17.757
Just a small dent.

09:17.792 --> 09:19.292
Look, we really need
to be somewhere,

09:19.343 --> 09:21.928
so I'd rather not wait around
to file a police report.

09:43.997 --> 09:46.131
<i>The guy who took
Rex was wearing, um,</i>

09:46.166 --> 09:47.783
a green sweatshirt
with a hood on it.

09:47.817 --> 09:49.251
I-I just told the officer.

09:49.285 --> 09:51.620
Tell me... what did he say?

09:51.654 --> 09:52.463
He didn't say anything.

09:52.464 --> 09:53.386
Not a word? Not a sound?

09:53.387 --> 09:54.640
Before I knew what was happening,

09:54.674 --> 09:58.427
he put this cloth over my mouth,
which had this chemical smell,

09:58.461 --> 09:59.712
and... and that's it.

09:59.763 --> 10:01.347
That's... that's all I remember.

10:01.381 --> 10:02.931
No. No, you got to remember
something else.

10:02.966 --> 10:04.416
- You're forgetting something, some detail.
- No, I'm not.

10:04.451 --> 10:05.768
- I'm not.
- What car was he driving?

10:05.802 --> 10:08.354
I don't know. I... Was he armed?

10:08.388 --> 10:10.773
No. I don't... oh...
Tara, think.

10:10.807 --> 10:12.274
Cooper wants something.
I need to know what.

10:12.308 --> 10:13.942
- You're forgetting something.
- I'm sorry, Michael.

10:13.977 --> 10:15.144
Michael, come on.

10:17.063 --> 10:18.480
Sorry.

10:18.514 --> 10:20.282
She told us
everything she knows.

10:20.316 --> 10:22.479
Uh...
Yeah? What?

10:22.480 --> 10:25.154
Tara's cell phone
hasn't turned up yet.

10:25.188 --> 10:28.624
If Rex grabbed it, we might
be able to get a location.

10:28.658 --> 10:30.692
Doesn't make any sense.

10:30.710 --> 10:32.211
What does he want with Rex?

10:32.245 --> 10:33.862
Wants to get back at you.

10:33.880 --> 10:35.297
You were one of his
arresting officers.

10:35.331 --> 10:36.415
So were you.

10:36.466 --> 10:37.883
If he wanted revenge,
we'd be dead already.

10:37.917 --> 10:39.001
Why didn't he come after us?

10:39.035 --> 10:41.203
He... he wants something.

10:41.221 --> 10:43.205
Well, whatever he wants,

10:43.223 --> 10:44.807
we'll find out soon enough.

10:44.841 --> 10:46.008
We're tapping your phones

10:46.042 --> 10:47.676
in case he tries
to get contact.

10:47.710 --> 10:49.344
Hey.
Cooper's dialysis nurse,

10:49.378 --> 10:51.230
they gave her
a field polygraph... she failed.

10:51.264 --> 10:52.981
Now, if she
helped Cooper, then...

10:53.016 --> 10:54.566
Might know where Rex is.

12:01.134 --> 12:05.137
I don't know what you want...

12:05.171 --> 12:08.173
but you should know
that my father's a cop.

12:10.310 --> 12:13.312
Pretty soon, there'll be a
lot of people looking for me.

12:13.346 --> 12:17.966
So before you do something
you can't take back...

12:17.984 --> 12:22.654
please just... let me go.

12:22.689 --> 12:25.491
Okay?

12:25.525 --> 12:27.659
Please.

12:29.696 --> 12:31.697
Please.

12:35.335 --> 12:37.870
Help!

12:37.921 --> 12:39.855
Someone help me, please!

12:39.889 --> 12:42.140
Help!

12:45.311 --> 12:47.946
As God is my witness,
I wouldn't have helped him

12:47.981 --> 12:49.464
if I'd known this would happen.

12:49.498 --> 12:52.301
You're an accessory.

12:52.335 --> 12:54.002
You understand that?

12:54.020 --> 12:56.638
That means in the eyes of the
law, you're as guilty as Cooper.

12:56.672 --> 13:00.559
And kidnapping carries a
minimum sentence of 20 years.

13:00.610 --> 13:01.643
I swear,

13:01.677 --> 13:03.645
I don't know
where he took your son,

13:03.679 --> 13:06.014
so I can't tell you.

13:07.634 --> 13:10.602
He never mentioned
a specific place?

13:10.637 --> 13:13.455
What about a person he
was in contact with?

13:13.489 --> 13:15.257
A friend, a family member?

13:15.291 --> 13:16.692
He doesn't have anyone.

13:16.726 --> 13:20.078
Not anymore.

13:20.129 --> 13:22.548
I was the only one.

13:22.582 --> 13:27.169
We spent three hours a day
together, twice a week.

13:27.203 --> 13:29.338
He asked me to pray with him.

13:31.040 --> 13:33.058
He said he was innocent.

13:35.094 --> 13:36.879
Yeah.

13:36.913 --> 13:39.881
I hope one day
you'll forgive me.

13:42.385 --> 13:45.320
I'll pray for your son.

13:50.693 --> 13:53.195
Where's Jim?

13:53.229 --> 13:54.563
Coordinating the canvass.

13:54.597 --> 13:56.698
Anyone Cooper's ever known,
anyone who visited him

13:56.732 --> 13:58.500
in prison, we're
running them down.

13:58.534 --> 14:00.702
The witness Tara finished
giving her statement.

14:00.737 --> 14:01.903
She's at your desk.

14:01.921 --> 14:03.922
She wants to talk to you.

14:05.592 --> 14:08.760
Hey, Tara.
You okay?

14:08.795 --> 14:11.546
He called.

14:11.580 --> 14:13.932
Cooper... he left a message
on my home machine.

14:13.967 --> 14:15.517
He called your house?

14:15.551 --> 14:17.585
I called in my voice mail
and the message was there.

14:17.604 --> 14:18.887
- When?
- Just now.

14:18.921 --> 14:20.272
What'd he say?

14:20.306 --> 14:22.774
He left his number,
and he wants you to call him.

14:22.809 --> 14:25.093
Michael, Michael.

14:25.111 --> 14:28.363
He said if you tell anyone,
he'll know, and he'll kill Rex.

14:31.484 --> 14:33.768
This is Detective
Britten, badge 8277.

14:33.786 --> 14:36.238
I need you to do
a reverse look-up.

14:36.272 --> 14:39.992
310-555-1212.

14:40.043 --> 14:42.110
Checking.
Just a moment, Detective.

14:45.081 --> 14:46.098
Detective?

14:46.132 --> 14:47.115
Yeah.

14:47.133 --> 14:48.450
That number is a public phone

14:48.468 --> 14:51.119
on McClintock Avenue
and Third Street.

14:51.137 --> 14:54.256
No, that's the address
of the station I'm calling from.

14:54.290 --> 14:56.842
It's also where the pay phone
is located, sir.

14:56.893 --> 14:59.728
On the Northwest corner.

15:12.608 --> 15:14.493
- Cooper?
- Who?!

15:17.080 --> 15:19.498
- Where is he?
- Dude who gave me this?

15:19.532 --> 15:20.832
- Yeah.
- Said he'd give me another 20

15:20.867 --> 15:22.334
if I stood here
for a couple hours.

15:22.368 --> 15:24.453
I told him fine, I ain't
got no prior engagements.

15:24.487 --> 15:26.705
All right, get out of here.

15:26.756 --> 15:29.508
- What about my other $20?
- Go!

15:33.329 --> 15:34.563
Cooper?

15:34.597 --> 15:35.814
Dad, it's me.

15:35.848 --> 15:37.182
Rex?

15:37.216 --> 15:38.666
Son, are you all right?

15:38.685 --> 15:39.851
I'm in the desert,
some kind of shack,

15:39.886 --> 15:41.687
- two hours from downtown...!
- Shut up!

15:41.721 --> 15:42.688
Rex!

15:42.722 --> 15:43.722
Shut up!

15:44.774 --> 15:45.475
Rex!

15:45.476 --> 15:47.376
If you ever want to see
your son alive again,

15:47.377 --> 15:49.066
do exactly what I tell you.

15:51.299 --> 15:52.675
I'm listening.

15:52.949 --> 15:57.035
10:00. 2211 Industrial Road
in San Bernardino.

15:57.070 --> 15:59.037
Come alone.

15:59.072 --> 16:00.405
I see anyone else...

16:00.456 --> 16:03.375
I even think I see anyone else...
and your boy is gonna die.

16:03.409 --> 16:04.826
You understand me?

16:04.860 --> 16:07.796
I understand.

16:07.830 --> 16:10.248
I'll do whatever you want.

16:10.299 --> 16:13.585
But... don't hurt him.

16:13.636 --> 16:16.054
Please.

16:17.974 --> 16:20.976
Cooper?
Cooper?!

16:27.316 --> 16:29.434
I'm sorry it's come to this.

16:29.485 --> 16:33.772
No son should ever have to pay
for the sins of his father.

17:13.459 --> 17:14.804
Stand up.

17:14.904 --> 17:16.489
Stand up!

17:20.125 --> 17:21.425
Where's my son?

17:22.692 --> 17:24.714
Tell me where he is! Now!

17:24.852 --> 17:27.269
Even if I tell you where he is,

17:27.997 --> 17:31.316
by the time you figure out
if I'm telling you the truth,

17:31.334 --> 17:33.151
your son will be dead
of dehydration.

17:33.942 --> 17:36.011
You won't find him without me.

17:36.599 --> 17:40.317
So take your hands off of me,
and let's talk.

17:49.086 --> 17:50.803
What do you want?

17:50.838 --> 17:56.392
Same thing I wanted
for the last ten years:

17:56.427 --> 17:57.927
Justice.

18:00.431 --> 18:04.233
Derek Bell deserved to die,
but I didn't kill him.

18:04.268 --> 18:08.571
Just tell me what I have to do
to get my son back.

18:08.605 --> 18:10.907
Prove who set me up.

18:10.941 --> 18:13.743
Nobody set you up.

18:13.777 --> 18:15.644
Somebody planted that gun
that night.

18:15.662 --> 18:18.404
You just didn't
look close enough.

18:18.446 --> 18:21.516
It took me ten years,
but I finally figured out

18:21.516 --> 18:23.467
who killed Derek Bell
that night.

18:24.225 --> 18:26.059
And you're going to help me
prove it.

18:29.343 --> 18:31.109
- Drop your weapon!
- W-Wait.

18:31.109 --> 18:32.743
No, no, no,
no! Hold it!

18:32.963 --> 18:34.430
No!

18:34.465 --> 18:36.516
No! No!

18:36.550 --> 18:39.135
Cooper. Hey, Cooper.

18:39.169 --> 18:40.669
They're not with me, I swear.

18:40.687 --> 18:43.106
Cooper!
Tell me where my son is.

18:43.140 --> 18:45.942
Please. Please tell me
where he is.

18:45.976 --> 18:47.860
Suspect is down.

18:47.895 --> 18:49.278
Where is he?

18:49.313 --> 18:52.115
No. No.

18:53.666 --> 18:55.033
I can't lose him again.

18:55.114 --> 18:57.192
Come on!

18:57.261 --> 18:58.678
Michael.

18:58.752 --> 19:00.503
Get off me!

19:03.558 --> 19:05.703
You just killed my son.

19:07.757 --> 19:10.422
You just killed my son!

19:14.221 --> 19:16.222
Let's get him out of here.

19:29.461 --> 19:31.412
Why did you follow me?

19:32.134 --> 19:35.274
Captain thought Cooper
might try to contact you.

19:38.105 --> 19:39.539
Well, did he say anything?

19:39.573 --> 19:42.408
I mean, anything we
can use to find Rex?

19:42.442 --> 19:44.127
He was just about to.

19:44.161 --> 19:45.692
About to what?

19:45.692 --> 19:47.058
About to tell me.

19:47.464 --> 19:49.941
How I can help him
prove his innocence.

19:49.941 --> 19:50.823
Come on, Mike.

19:50.824 --> 19:52.571
Innocent man
wouldn't kidnap Rex.

19:54.499 --> 19:56.300
Look, don't do
this to yourself.

19:56.623 --> 19:58.224
None of this is your fault.

19:58.259 --> 20:00.260
Cooper was guilty.

20:02.740 --> 20:04.591
Best thing you can
do for Rex right now

20:04.592 --> 20:06.013
is to get a clear head.

20:06.133 --> 20:09.275
There's nothing you can do here
that isn't already being done.

20:09.275 --> 20:11.076
What, I should go home?

20:11.334 --> 20:13.902
What are you suggesting,
I take a rest?

21:00.652 --> 21:02.586
Hey, Vega, you near your desk?

21:02.621 --> 21:03.921
Uh, I can be. Why?

21:03.955 --> 21:06.111
I need you to access the
state prison database for me,

21:06.112 --> 21:07.812
look up the status of an inmate.

21:08.095 --> 21:09.512
His name is John Cooper.

21:09.577 --> 21:11.111
What's this about?

21:11.146 --> 21:12.313
Time sensitive, Vega.

21:12.347 --> 21:14.031
Well, that doesn't
answer my question.

21:14.049 --> 21:15.966
Just tell me if he's still
in Tehachapi Prison.

21:16.001 --> 21:17.468
Name is John...

21:17.502 --> 21:20.054
John Cooper. Yeah, I heard you
the first time.

21:20.088 --> 21:22.189
Yeah, Cooper's still locked up.

21:22.223 --> 21:23.641
What's going on?

21:23.675 --> 21:25.509
I'm taking the day off.

21:25.543 --> 21:26.844
Cover for me.

21:26.878 --> 21:28.345
I'm going up to Tehachapi.

21:28.379 --> 21:29.980
Because of this guy Cooper?

21:31.733 --> 21:33.216
All right,
you're not telling me.

21:33.234 --> 21:34.935
What am I supposed
to tell the captain?

21:34.986 --> 21:36.219
Whatever you want.

21:36.237 --> 21:37.554
And I'm supposed to
do that because...?

21:37.572 --> 21:39.490
Because you're my partner.

21:39.524 --> 21:41.859
You know, that's supposed to go
both ways, Michael.

21:43.895 --> 21:45.863
I'll call you back.

21:45.897 --> 21:47.614
- You're awake.
- Hey.

21:47.666 --> 21:49.667
And dressed.

21:51.920 --> 21:55.005
Wow, you were tossing
and turning last night.

21:55.040 --> 21:56.540
Did you have a bad dream?

21:58.576 --> 22:00.911
I didn't sleep
very well, either.

22:00.929 --> 22:02.913
I think I was probably
obsessing about today.

22:02.931 --> 22:05.099
Today?
I've been thinking.

22:05.133 --> 22:07.351
Maybe one of us
should say something,

22:07.385 --> 22:10.437
since they're doing
this thing for Rex.

22:12.807 --> 22:14.825
Honey...

22:16.394 --> 22:18.779
I'm not going to
make the fundraiser.

22:18.813 --> 22:20.097
I'm really sorry.

22:21.116 --> 22:23.117
You're not gonna make it?

22:23.151 --> 22:25.285
What?
I can't, I... I, uh...

22:25.320 --> 22:27.621
- That was Vega on the phone, there's a...
- But you...

22:27.655 --> 22:28.739
been a child abduction.

22:28.773 --> 22:31.608
The kid's about
the same age as Rex.

22:31.626 --> 22:33.744
Michael...

22:34.829 --> 22:37.131
- They called me.
- O-Okay, that's awful,

22:37.165 --> 22:39.116
but you're not the only
detective on duty.

22:39.134 --> 22:40.217
I know.

22:40.251 --> 22:41.385
The fundraiser's two hours.

22:41.419 --> 22:43.220
- They need me.
<i>- They</i> need you?

22:43.254 --> 22:44.805
I need you!

22:44.839 --> 22:47.124
I... Michael,
it's two hours. Okay?

22:47.158 --> 22:48.625
You can go back to work after.

22:48.643 --> 22:50.144
I-I...

22:50.178 --> 22:52.479
Bad things are always going to
be happening to other people,

22:52.514 --> 22:56.133
but s-something really
bad happened to us.

22:56.151 --> 22:57.184
I know.

22:57.235 --> 22:59.486
So? Be with me today.

23:01.523 --> 23:04.491
Honey, I can't.
I...

23:22.335 --> 23:26.941
<i>My son started volunteering
here about a year ago,</i>

23:26.991 --> 23:28.832
<i>and, honestly, he did it</i>

23:28.832 --> 23:32.335
<i>because of the community</i>
<i>service requirement at school.</i>

23:32.831 --> 23:36.700
At first, all my husband and I
heard, over and over, was...

23:37.499 --> 23:39.613
"Why do I have to do this?"

23:39.838 --> 23:42.823
I think he was counting down
days till he could go back to

23:42.857 --> 23:45.292
hanging out with his friends
after school,

23:45.326 --> 23:46.977
instead of manning
the phones here.

23:47.011 --> 23:52.382
But eventually, and without us
even really noticing,

23:52.400 --> 23:55.705
he-he stopped complaining.

23:55.902 --> 23:59.872
And one night, Rex didn't come
home when he was supposed to,

24:00.024 --> 24:02.225
and... and he wasn't
answering his phone.

24:02.243 --> 24:04.194
I was so worried.

24:04.228 --> 24:05.863
I found him here...

24:08.283 --> 24:10.918
two hours after
his shift had ended,

24:10.952 --> 24:14.371
and he was on the phone with
some 14-year-old girl

24:14.405 --> 24:19.242
who was depressed and
thinking about hurting herself.

24:21.880 --> 24:26.600
I stood behind Rex
for close to an hour,

24:26.634 --> 24:29.085
and I watched him...

24:32.382 --> 24:35.284
slowly convince this
girl to get help.

24:37.261 --> 24:42.649
Here was this person that I had
held in my arms as a baby...

24:44.736 --> 24:47.103
who had just saved
someone's life.

24:51.272 --> 24:55.183
And this wave of pride,
I felt it.

24:55.246 --> 24:59.333
And I... I grabbed him
and I hugged him and...

24:59.384 --> 25:02.252
I started crying.

25:02.286 --> 25:04.171
I couldn't stop.

25:09.510 --> 25:11.461
And Rex just said
I was embarrassing him,

25:11.479 --> 25:13.146
and he asked me to leave.

25:15.568 --> 25:18.079
So I left...

25:18.333 --> 25:22.068
with a gift that
I'll always carry with me.

25:23.958 --> 25:29.363
That night... in this room...

25:29.414 --> 25:33.100
Rex showed me
who he really was...

25:33.134 --> 25:39.306
<i>and he gave me a glimpse of</i>
<i>the man he would have become.</i>

25:43.628 --> 25:47.931
<i>Thank you</i>
<i>for remembering my son today...</i>

25:50.334 --> 25:53.003
and for being a part of
this wonderful place.

25:55.006 --> 25:58.191
Hey, hon, it's me.
I hope it's going okay.

25:58.226 --> 25:59.943
I'm sorry I'm not there.

26:04.348 --> 26:06.733
You know, I'm sure it-it's not
what you want to hear right now,

26:06.784 --> 26:10.654
but...
I'm doing the best I can.

26:12.731 --> 26:14.348
Whoever finds this...

26:15.531 --> 26:17.265
please get it to my father.

26:18.496 --> 26:23.667
<i>He's a detective</i>
<i>with the LAPD, Michael Britten.</i>

26:24.029 --> 26:27.039
I was hoping to talk to him
face-to-face, but...

26:28.414 --> 26:31.225
it's starting to look like that
may not happen.

26:48.993 --> 26:51.161
<i>No, don't die!</i>

26:56.250 --> 26:57.634
Except for my ex-wife,

26:57.668 --> 27:00.670
you're the last person I ever
expected to lay eyes on again.

27:02.033 --> 27:05.559
I'm here because after
your appeal was rejected,

27:06.336 --> 27:08.430
I got a call from
an anonymous source.

27:08.822 --> 27:10.745
He said he was familiar
with your case

27:11.236 --> 27:13.753
and he had evidence that could
prove your innocence.

27:14.770 --> 27:15.937
Really?

27:17.079 --> 27:18.759
Now, if I got it wrong
about you,

27:18.759 --> 27:20.811
I'd like a chance
to make things right.

27:21.816 --> 27:23.751
Make it right?

27:24.620 --> 27:25.970
Okay.

27:26.005 --> 27:29.140
How about you giving me back
the last ten years of my life?

27:29.466 --> 27:30.682
Can you do that?

27:30.813 --> 27:33.623
No, but if you can corroborate
what my source told me,

27:34.127 --> 27:35.844
I can get you out of here.

27:37.023 --> 27:40.692
Now, he mentioned something
about a place in the desert.

27:44.152 --> 27:47.037
What can you tell
me about that?

27:48.935 --> 27:50.536
Man, let me tell you something.

27:50.696 --> 27:52.914
I don't know
what this is all about,

27:53.407 --> 27:55.875
but I know
when I'm being played.

27:56.500 --> 27:57.311
Let's just say

27:57.312 --> 27:59.347
I do know where this place is.

28:00.562 --> 28:03.181
What's it got to do with proving
I'm innocent?

28:08.840 --> 28:11.625
You wouldn't believe me
if I told you.

28:11.714 --> 28:14.182
Just like you don't believe me.

28:15.836 --> 28:18.661
You still believe that I killed
Derek Bell, don't you?

28:20.888 --> 28:22.453
And the reason
you don't believe me is

28:22.454 --> 28:24.153
because you don't want to.

28:24.686 --> 28:28.739
Because it means that you have
to live with what you did to me.

28:28.984 --> 28:30.985
But I'm good, man.

28:31.019 --> 28:33.603
I-I don't need you
to believe me anymore.

28:34.471 --> 28:36.772
I just need you
to get me out of here.

28:36.909 --> 28:38.192
And after you do that,

28:38.210 --> 28:39.854
I'll tell you about this place
in the desert.

28:39.855 --> 28:41.140
Well, it may be
too late by then.

28:41.141 --> 28:42.757
Too late for who, man?

28:45.867 --> 28:49.253
All right, say you
didn't kill Derek Bell.

28:49.459 --> 28:52.144
Tell me who you think did.

28:54.465 --> 28:56.799
For the longest time,
I thought it was you.

28:57.443 --> 28:58.186
Yeah.

28:58.187 --> 29:01.132
See, I figured it had
to be a cop, right?

29:02.151 --> 29:05.620
Someone who could control
the evidence.

29:08.709 --> 29:11.361
Yeah. You know who
I'm talking about.

29:14.521 --> 29:15.354
Hello?

29:15.635 --> 29:18.220
Jim, hey, it's me, Michael.

29:18.293 --> 29:21.012
Michael, hey,
good to hear your voice.

29:21.109 --> 29:22.159
How are you?

29:22.850 --> 29:25.303
Oh, you know, still chasing
bad guys.

29:25.649 --> 29:27.617
How's Hannah?

29:27.926 --> 29:29.811
We're hanging in there.

29:30.782 --> 29:32.996
Listen, gee, I apologize.

29:33.068 --> 29:35.603
I, uh, I've been meaning
to reach out,

29:35.779 --> 29:37.123
invite you over for a beer.

29:37.124 --> 29:39.874
Sounds good.
What about later?

29:40.544 --> 29:42.313
Yeah, that'd be great.

29:42.751 --> 29:44.368
Come on over.

29:55.992 --> 29:57.626
- Michael!
- Jim.

29:57.660 --> 29:58.994
Hey.

29:59.028 --> 30:00.362
It's been way too long.

30:00.380 --> 30:01.964
- Yeah.
- Please.

30:01.980 --> 30:03.296
What's with the hand?

30:03.314 --> 30:05.799
Ah, it's nothing.
A little accident at the gym.

30:05.817 --> 30:07.818
Margaret's been after me
to lose ten pounds.

30:07.852 --> 30:09.937
She here? Margaret?

30:09.971 --> 30:12.139
No, sorry. You missed her.
She sends you her love.

30:12.369 --> 30:13.510
Can I get you a beer?

30:13.977 --> 30:15.739
To be honest with you,
I'm not really here

30:16.017 --> 30:17.603
on a social call.

30:19.222 --> 30:20.566
Something with Hannah?

30:21.699 --> 30:22.801
No, Hannah's good.

30:22.887 --> 30:24.705
Oh, thank God.

30:24.786 --> 30:28.655
We have to talk, Jim,
about, uh... John Cooper.

30:29.329 --> 30:31.282
He's doing life
for killing Derek Bell.

30:31.326 --> 30:32.826
You remember.

30:32.844 --> 30:35.546
Bell was holding a million
dollars in cash that night,

30:35.597 --> 30:38.465
and then I remember we recovered
less than $100,000.

30:38.500 --> 30:42.953
So... I did the math,
and here I am.

30:44.552 --> 30:46.707
You killed Bell,
you took the money,

30:46.707 --> 30:48.549
put the gun in Cooper's house.

30:49.033 --> 30:50.777
Where is this coming from?

30:51.360 --> 30:52.593
I got some of it from Cooper,

30:52.594 --> 30:54.508
from other places.
I put the pieces together.

30:54.742 --> 30:56.109
Listen, you're taking the word

30:56.160 --> 30:58.111
of a condemned murderer
over mine.

30:58.112 --> 31:00.434
Jim, you got me all wrong.
I'm not here to bust you

31:00.435 --> 31:01.665
and I'm not here to judge you.

31:01.666 --> 31:05.264
I don't care if Cooper rots
in jail the rest of his life.

31:06.114 --> 31:08.255
I just want what's mine.

31:08.589 --> 31:11.074
<i>People get rich while people
who put their lives</i>

31:11.092 --> 31:13.877
<i>on the line
like us get next to nothing.</i>

31:14.888 --> 31:16.364
I want my share.

31:17.028 --> 31:18.049
Your share?

31:18.185 --> 31:19.318
That was our bust.

31:19.319 --> 31:21.005
That is our money.

31:21.006 --> 31:24.841
Michael, I didn't frame anyone.
There is no money.

31:24.841 --> 31:27.009
None of this is real.

31:27.027 --> 31:29.278
I don't think I'm making
myself clear, Jim.

31:29.312 --> 31:32.695
I'm... I'm not giving
you a choice.

31:33.551 --> 31:36.892
You pay me, or I will
go to Internal Affairs.

31:37.402 --> 31:39.495
You can go talk
to them all you want,

31:39.495 --> 31:42.647
but you're only gonna end up
looking crazy.

31:42.665 --> 31:45.770
And from what I understand,
you don't need much help.

31:46.122 --> 31:49.627
I'm sorry I said that.
I talked to Captain Harper.

31:50.631 --> 31:53.174
She told me what's been going
on since the accident;

31:53.174 --> 31:55.992
All the erratic behavior.

31:56.076 --> 31:58.670
I didn't realize
how serious it is.

31:58.670 --> 32:00.435
That's not what's going
on here, and you know it.

32:00.530 --> 32:02.531
She's got you seeing
a psychiatrist.

32:02.565 --> 32:05.234
She assigned you a new partner

32:05.268 --> 32:08.254
to keep an eye on you.

32:08.288 --> 32:11.573
Are you cutting me in or not?

32:11.591 --> 32:14.343
Listen to what you're saying.
Look at yourself.

32:14.378 --> 32:16.879
Now, we need to
get you some help.

32:16.913 --> 32:20.099
All right, that's enough.
We're done.

32:20.133 --> 32:22.718
Tell you what. Let's call
your doctor, huh?

32:22.752 --> 32:24.437
We could figure
this out together.

32:24.471 --> 32:26.639
Here's what I'm gonna do.
I'm gonna walk out the door,

32:26.690 --> 32:28.274
and I'm gonna go straight
to the captain.

32:28.308 --> 32:31.394
Next that will happen, they'll
subpoena your bank records,

32:31.428 --> 32:34.280
<i>and you spend the rest
of your life in prison</i>

32:34.314 --> 32:36.332
like Cooper.

32:37.601 --> 32:40.703
Now is that what you want?

32:40.737 --> 32:43.856
I am your friend.
I came here to give you a chance,

32:43.890 --> 32:46.442
but it's up to you to take it.

32:46.460 --> 32:49.412
It's your call.

33:08.298 --> 33:10.850
There isn't much left.

33:16.656 --> 33:20.109
Amazing how fast
the money goes...

33:20.143 --> 33:23.812
but what's left... it's yours.

33:25.615 --> 33:26.916
If I could,

33:26.950 --> 33:29.952
I'd take back everything
that happened that night, but...

33:29.986 --> 33:31.370
the money was there,

33:31.421 --> 33:35.324
I pulled the trigger, and there
was just no turning back.

33:43.183 --> 33:44.683
Michael?

33:44.718 --> 33:47.503
Michael, where are you going?

33:47.521 --> 33:50.005
I told you
I'd give you the money.

33:52.859 --> 33:56.195
Sir, you're under arrest
for the murder of Derek Bell.

33:56.229 --> 33:57.846
You have the right
to remain silent.

33:57.864 --> 34:00.349
Anything you say can
and will be used against you.

34:00.383 --> 34:01.951
You have the right
to an attorney.

34:03.620 --> 34:06.455
Hey, for a minute,
he had me wondering

34:06.490 --> 34:08.541
if you were making
this whole thing up.

34:08.574 --> 34:09.875
You weren't the only one.

34:09.909 --> 34:11.827
This is Detective
Michael Britten.

34:11.860 --> 34:13.829
I need to speak
to Warden Gutierrez.

34:13.862 --> 34:15.864
Tell him it's an emergency.

34:15.882 --> 34:20.252
Warden, I need you to put John
Cooper on the phone right now.

34:24.424 --> 34:27.059
Still not sure why you can't
tell me who tipped you

34:27.092 --> 34:28.377
on Cooper's place in the desert.

34:29.918 --> 34:32.266
Not allowed to give up
the source.

34:32.594 --> 34:34.118
Not allowed?

34:34.884 --> 34:36.601
It's complicated.

34:36.652 --> 34:39.188
This source the same reason
you got IA talking to Mayhew?

34:39.222 --> 34:41.739
<i>Uh-huh. I got a friend over there.</i>

34:41.775 --> 34:43.159
Heard they was pulling him in,

34:43.193 --> 34:44.743
looking into his bank accounts.

34:44.777 --> 34:46.362
They're saying Mayhew's
the one who

34:46.396 --> 34:48.063
killed Derek Bell
and took his money.

34:48.081 --> 34:50.732
Yeah.

34:50.750 --> 34:53.202
That means Cooper was innocent.

34:53.235 --> 34:55.571
Yeah.

35:14.274 --> 35:16.758
Rex! Rex!

35:16.776 --> 35:19.562
Inside! Rex! Watch out.

35:24.868 --> 35:27.236
Rex!

35:27.270 --> 35:28.437
Rex, can you hear me?

35:28.455 --> 35:31.640
Dad... Rex?

35:36.713 --> 35:37.997
Get in there.

35:38.048 --> 35:40.549
Rex, I'm a paramedic.
I'm here to help you.

35:40.584 --> 35:42.618
Do you understand
what I'm saying?

35:42.636 --> 35:43.619
Sorry, son.

35:43.653 --> 35:45.888
Skins are real hot.

35:45.922 --> 35:47.590
You're gonna be all right.

35:47.624 --> 35:49.791
Backing out pretty good.
Give me a line.

35:49.809 --> 35:51.343
Stay with us, buddy.

35:51.394 --> 35:52.728
I'm here with you now.

35:52.762 --> 35:54.580
Here you go.

36:05.188 --> 36:07.288
You know,
at some unconscious level,

36:07.379 --> 36:09.881
you might have always suspected
that Cooper was innocent.

36:10.150 --> 36:13.374
Cooper's failed appeal coincided
with your son's death,

36:13.401 --> 36:16.320
which caused you to create
a dream in which you had

36:16.371 --> 36:17.795
to prove Cooper's innocence.

36:17.796 --> 36:20.430
Or you would have to relive
the loss of your son.

36:20.608 --> 36:23.043
If I had known, if I had
suspected on any level

36:23.077 --> 36:25.212
there was something wrong
with the Cooper case,

36:25.246 --> 36:27.397
I would have done something
by myself a long time ago.

36:27.432 --> 36:29.883
But you didn't, and it's
understandable why.

36:29.918 --> 36:31.919
People naturally flee
from their own guilt.

36:31.953 --> 36:34.421
They push it aside.

36:34.455 --> 36:38.759
This dream was a way of forcing
you to do the right thing.

36:38.793 --> 36:42.963
It's a kind of... reckoning
for your conscience.

36:45.400 --> 36:47.651
An innocent man lost a decade
of his life

36:47.685 --> 36:49.603
because I couldn't see
the truth.

36:49.637 --> 36:53.106
I don't find that
particularly admirable.

36:53.140 --> 36:54.825
So you blame yourself

36:54.859 --> 36:58.111
for wrongfully sending Cooper
to prison,

36:58.145 --> 37:00.530
and for him ultimately dying?

37:00.893 --> 37:03.272
Of course I blame myself.
It's my fault.

37:04.175 --> 37:05.978
I would argue it is
Mayhew's fault

37:06.004 --> 37:07.621
more than it is yours.

37:08.764 --> 37:11.319
The point is, you felt guilty.

37:12.139 --> 37:14.731
And to alleviate that guilt,

37:14.821 --> 37:18.096
you created a dream
where you freed Cooper.

37:20.436 --> 37:22.920
<i>If that's the case,</i>
<i>it didn't work.</i>

37:23.187 --> 37:25.797
I don't feel any better
about what happened to him.

37:26.557 --> 37:28.475
Isn't that interesting?

37:29.205 --> 37:31.831
Even when you go so far
as to dream a world

37:31.831 --> 37:33.565
where everything turns out
all right,

37:33.655 --> 37:36.265
you're still plagued
with guilt.

37:39.006 --> 37:41.874
I'd like you to ask yourself
something, Detective.

37:43.304 --> 37:45.263
Where do you think
this inability

37:45.298 --> 37:48.029
to forgive yourself comes from?

38:17.401 --> 38:18.284
Hi.

38:18.394 --> 38:19.558
Hi.

38:21.112 --> 38:22.729
How's he doing?

38:22.747 --> 38:24.848
He's, he's okay.

38:24.882 --> 38:27.000
Doctors say he can go home
tomorrow.

38:27.035 --> 38:27.918
Maybe the day after.

38:29.778 --> 38:30.788
That's great news.

38:30.855 --> 38:32.623
Yeah.

38:35.631 --> 38:37.473
I keep thinking
if you hadn't found him...

38:37.474 --> 38:38.559
Hey, I did.

38:38.579 --> 38:42.432
If you're still blaming yourself
for any of this, forget it.

38:42.467 --> 38:46.353
If it's anybody's fault,
it's mine, all right?

38:47.555 --> 38:50.256
Come here.
It's okay.

38:55.070 --> 39:00.015
Um... I came by
to give you this.

39:01.010 --> 39:02.062
It's my phone.

39:02.063 --> 39:04.474
The, uh, crime scene
guys found it

39:04.474 --> 39:06.462
and returned it to me.

39:07.997 --> 39:11.182
Turns out Rex recorded himself
out there.

39:14.560 --> 39:16.495
You should hear
what he had to say.

39:19.735 --> 39:21.451
Thanks.

39:24.675 --> 39:26.303
<i>If you're watching this,</i>

39:26.303 --> 39:29.505
<i>I'm guessing you're pretty</i>
<i>messed up about what happened.</i>

39:29.647 --> 39:32.260
<i>But there's some things I really
need to tell you...</i>

39:32.420 --> 39:34.888
<i>which as it turns out, I've...</i>

39:35.635 --> 39:37.265
<i>had a lot of time to think
about.</i>

39:38.581 --> 39:41.939
<i>I know things haven't been
so easy between us lately,</i>

39:42.110 --> 39:46.057
<i>that I haven't been...
communicating.</i>

39:46.901 --> 39:49.746
<i>I think it's maybe because</i>

39:50.035 --> 39:53.473
<i>I was afraid</i>
<i>of what I might say...</i>

39:53.921 --> 39:58.008
<i>because of how angry I was...</i>

39:58.042 --> 40:00.279
<i>about losing Mom.</i>

40:01.263 --> 40:02.864
<i>Mom was...</i>

40:03.348 --> 40:06.083
<i>she was really what held</i>
<i>all of us together.</i>

40:07.920 --> 40:10.123
<i>Without her,</i>
<i>I didn't know what to do.</i>

40:10.703 --> 40:13.493
<i>And I think you kind of felt</i>
<i>the same way, too.</i>

40:14.594 --> 40:16.719
<i>But I want you to know...</i>

40:17.350 --> 40:19.302
<i>and this is really important...</i>

40:19.446 --> 40:21.947
<i>I don't blame you</i>
<i>for what happened,</i>

40:22.153 --> 40:23.537
<i>for her being gone.</i>

40:23.784 --> 40:26.570
<i>So please don't blame yourself.</i>

40:27.561 --> 40:29.829
Did you find him?

40:30.460 --> 40:32.569
The boy who was kidnapped?

40:33.564 --> 40:34.666
You find him?

40:35.141 --> 40:37.314
Yeah. Yeah, we did.

40:38.557 --> 40:40.697
Is he gonna be okay?

40:43.541 --> 40:47.260
Yeah... I think so.

40:53.736 --> 40:55.499
I thought about you all day.

40:55.566 --> 40:58.157
I really wanted to be there...

40:59.070 --> 41:00.737
be with you.

41:01.811 --> 41:03.068
I know.

41:05.027 --> 41:06.813
I'm sorry.

41:16.745 --> 41:19.634
So... how'd it go?

41:20.964 --> 41:22.983
It was hard...

41:24.390 --> 41:26.486
until it wasn't.

41:28.468 --> 41:31.136
There was just so much love.

41:31.585 --> 41:36.223
And I actually felt like he,
he was in the room with me.

41:37.725 --> 41:39.809
I just kept wishing
you were there,

41:39.844 --> 41:42.779
so you could know
what that feels like.

41:51.438 --> 41:54.491
<i>We haven't talked
about it in awhile...</i>

41:54.542 --> 41:58.895
<i>but I do think there's</i>
<i>something else after this life.</i>

41:58.930 --> 42:01.364
<i>I want you to know I love you.</i>

42:01.399 --> 42:03.250
<i>And that's what I'm going</i>
<i>to hold onto...</i>

42:03.284 --> 42:05.235
<i>until I see you again.</i>
