Previously on 90210...

00:05.213 --> 00:06.882
Adrianna, this is Lila,
our bass player.

00:06.924 --> 00:07.967
Hey.
Hi.

00:08.007 --> 00:09.844
I joined the band to get

00:09.885 --> 00:11.804
over Navid, and now I have
to spend every day

00:11.846 --> 00:13.221
with the new girl he's dating?

00:13.263 --> 00:14.556
MR. CANNON:
I'm kicking you
off the Blaze.

00:14.598 --> 00:17.309
No! What do you want?
Just name it. I'll do anything.

00:17.351 --> 00:18.894
Please, please, please.
I'll do anything.

00:18.936 --> 00:20.354
Are you offering
to sleep with me?

00:20.395 --> 00:22.397
What? No. I...

00:22.439 --> 00:25.400
Because that would be
completely inappropriate.

00:25.442 --> 00:27.653
You're off the Blaze.
Look, I know this isn't

00:27.695 --> 00:30.238
what you want to hear, but
you were the one out of line.

00:30.280 --> 00:31.532
(groans)

00:31.573 --> 00:33.742
I cannot believe you're
taking his side, Silver.

00:33.784 --> 00:35.035
He said if I wanted

00:35.076 --> 00:37.913
back on the Blaze, I
had to sleep with him.

00:37.955 --> 00:38.914
What?!

00:38.956 --> 00:40.248
GIA:
So, you want to go out

00:40.290 --> 00:42.668
on a date?

00:48.966 --> 00:50.592
(groans)

00:50.634 --> 00:51.593
Do you mind
if I crash here tonight?

00:51.635 --> 00:52.970
Not at all.

00:53.012 --> 00:54.763
Tonight, tomorrow,
as long as you want.

00:54.805 --> 00:55.931
I'm Laurel.

00:55.973 --> 00:57.683
Ryan.

00:59.267 --> 01:01.228
JASPER:
If I can't be with you,

01:01.269 --> 01:02.396
there's no point in living.

01:02.437 --> 01:03.480
Jasper, no.

01:03.522 --> 01:04.815
(phone beeps off)

01:14.324 --> 01:16.201
Jasper?

01:17.369 --> 01:19.246
I told you,
I don't know where he is.

01:19.287 --> 01:21.707
I just hope he's not getting
into too much trouble

01:21.749 --> 01:23.584
before his parents
come back to town.

01:23.625 --> 01:25.627
Yeah.

01:25.669 --> 01:27.128
JASPER (on answering machine):
Leave a message.

01:27.170 --> 01:29.506
Jasper, I need you to tell me
where you are, okay?

01:29.548 --> 01:33.052
I'm just getting really worried.
Please call me back.

01:33.092 --> 01:36.388
And-And please
don't hurt yourself.

02:00.621 --> 02:02.289
Jasper?!

02:04.332 --> 02:06.085
Jasper?

02:10.047 --> 02:13.258
What are you doing up there?

02:13.300 --> 02:15.343
It's all
pointless, Annie.

02:15.385 --> 02:16.303
What is?

02:16.344 --> 02:17.805
All of it.

02:17.846 --> 02:20.348
Life. It's a joke.

02:20.390 --> 02:22.851
It's painful.
It's humiliating.

02:22.893 --> 02:24.937
And I'm over it.

02:31.026 --> 02:33.236
You still have not
chosen a loofah.

02:33.278 --> 02:34.655
I think you should
come forward.

02:34.696 --> 02:36.156
Liam, no.

02:36.197 --> 02:38.283
What Mr. Cannon said to
you was sexual harassment.

02:38.325 --> 02:40.410
I just don't want to deal
with the aggravation.

02:40.452 --> 02:43.038
Now, I'm assuming you're
going to go with blue,

02:43.080 --> 02:44.665
but lavender could be
a bold statement for a guy.

02:44.706 --> 02:47.459
I don't understand.
Why don't you report him?

02:49.419 --> 02:51.713
Liam, this has been
a really crazy year.

02:51.755 --> 02:54.215
The feud with Annie,
the situation with Jen.

02:54.257 --> 02:57.636
Jen. Jen has hurt you enough.

02:57.678 --> 03:00.221
Don't let her stop you
from doing what's right.

03:00.263 --> 03:01.098
Liam.

03:02.557 --> 03:03.892
What?

03:03.934 --> 03:05.560
(sighs)

03:05.602 --> 03:07.186
The truth is...

03:07.228 --> 03:08.772
(sighs)

03:08.814 --> 03:10.107
I'm a lot more like Jen

03:10.149 --> 03:12.026
than you probably think.

03:12.067 --> 03:15.570
No. No, you are
nothing like Jen.

03:15.612 --> 03:19.116
And if you were, I
wouldn't be with you.

03:28.125 --> 03:30.377
Um, I'll take
an Arnold Palmer,

03:30.418 --> 03:32.295
uh, mostly iced tea.
Like, a quarter lemonade.

03:32.337 --> 03:34.840
And just a regular
water for me. Thanks.

03:34.882 --> 03:37.258
BARTENDER:
Coming right up.

03:37.300 --> 03:40.595
So, you notice anything
different about me?

03:40.637 --> 03:42.681
Uh...
You're taller?

03:42.723 --> 03:44.307
Shorter?

03:44.349 --> 03:45.851
Oh, wait. I know.
You shaved your mustache.

03:45.893 --> 03:48.436
Ha, ha. No.
I got a haircut.

03:48.478 --> 03:49.771
Oh. Really?

03:49.813 --> 03:51.439
Like, a hair cut?
Single hair?

03:51.481 --> 03:53.608
You're just not very
detail-oriented, are you?

03:53.650 --> 03:55.235
Just because
I didn't notice

03:55.276 --> 03:56.611
your emperor's
new haircut...

03:56.653 --> 04:00.240
Now, come here,
you totally transformed woman.

04:01.241 --> 04:02.784
Hey! Dixon.

04:02.826 --> 04:05.453
TEDDY: Hey, man.
How's it going?

04:05.495 --> 04:07.122
Who you here with?

04:07.164 --> 04:10.458
Uh, no one.

04:10.500 --> 04:11.459
By myself.

04:11.501 --> 04:13.128
Oh.

04:13.170 --> 04:14.796
You know what?

04:14.838 --> 04:16.548
I should set you up
with my mixed doubles partner.

04:16.589 --> 04:19.801
Uh, no. Uh, don't worry
about it, man.

04:19.843 --> 04:21.970
I'm serious.
She is totally hot.

04:22.012 --> 04:24.431
Definitely
not my type.

04:24.472 --> 04:27.809
Thanks for looking out
for me, but I'm cool

04:27.851 --> 04:29.061
doing my own thing.

04:30.395 --> 04:32.856
See y'all later.

04:32.898 --> 04:34.983
Jasper, please listen to me.

04:35.025 --> 04:35.984
It's not pointless.

04:36.026 --> 04:38.361
Well, what's the point?

04:38.403 --> 04:40.363
Huh?

04:40.405 --> 04:42.241
What's the point to life?

04:42.282 --> 04:43.825
You don't love me anymore.

04:47.871 --> 04:49.081
Do you?

04:54.002 --> 04:56.421
Jasper, no!

05:18.526 --> 05:20.195
(sighs)

05:20.237 --> 05:21.947
Hi. We're looking
for Jasper Herman.

05:21.989 --> 05:23.031
He's our son.

05:24.532 --> 05:27.828
I'll see if he's
out of surgery.

05:27.869 --> 05:30.205
Mr. and Mrs. Herman?

05:30.247 --> 05:31.206
Hi.
Annie.

05:31.248 --> 05:32.791
What's going on?
Do you know?

05:32.833 --> 05:34.126
All we've been told
is that he fell

05:34.168 --> 05:35.502
off the top
of the Hollywood sign.

05:35.543 --> 05:36.920
Were you with him?

05:36.962 --> 05:38.505
What was he even
doing up there?

05:38.546 --> 05:39.673
Was he filming something?

05:39.714 --> 05:41.925
Um...

05:41.967 --> 05:43.885
No, I...

05:43.927 --> 05:47.055
Look, he didn't fall.

05:48.682 --> 05:50.475
He jumped.

05:54.395 --> 05:56.190
Oh, my God.

05:58.150 --> 05:59.651
MR. HERMAN:
Um...

06:04.405 --> 06:07.159
Listen, you should, uh...
You should go home, Annie.

06:07.201 --> 06:08.869
Get some sleep, and...

06:08.910 --> 06:11.788
we'll call you
if we hear any news.

06:11.830 --> 06:14.208
Well, I-I can stay.

06:14.249 --> 06:16.001
No. Jasper's our son.

06:16.043 --> 06:18.962
We'll handle this. You should,
uh... take care of yourself.

06:19.004 --> 06:20.881

19:45.018 --> 19:46.560
about what
a great boyfriend I am...

19:46.602 --> 19:48.562
(laughs)

19:48.604 --> 19:50.439
Oh, prepare to be fussed over.

19:54.276 --> 19:56.070
SALESWOMAN:
Well, that one's $15.

19:56.112 --> 19:58.531
Uh, most of them
are $15, but...

19:58.572 --> 20:01.701
the long sleeves,
those are $20.

20:01.742 --> 20:03.369
Hey, hey--
what's the word?

20:03.410 --> 20:06.164
The word is that
I got a great guy.

20:07.331 --> 20:08.457
Oh, stop it. Come on.

20:08.499 --> 20:09.792
IVY:
No, I can't, it's true.

20:09.834 --> 20:11.711
Look what my little
Poopy got me.

20:12.962 --> 20:15.297
(laughter)

20:15.339 --> 20:16.465
I'm sorry, "Poopy"?

20:16.507 --> 20:19.760
Yeah. Yeah, that's
what she calls me.

20:19.802 --> 20:21.470
'Cause she's my little
Stinky Pants.

20:21.512 --> 20:23.472
I don't even want to know.

20:23.514 --> 20:24.724
SILVER:
Anyway...

20:24.765 --> 20:25.850
where's the band, guys?

20:25.892 --> 20:27.309
Aren't they supposed
to go on soon?

20:27.351 --> 20:28.644
Oh, you know bands--

20:28.686 --> 20:30.146
notoriously late.
Someone's probably

20:30.188 --> 20:32.439
throwing a fit or eating
a bat or something.

20:32.481 --> 20:33.482
(laughing)

20:33.524 --> 20:35.609
Anyway, should we get drinks?
You got it...

20:35.651 --> 20:36.652
Poopy.

20:36.694 --> 20:39.446
Oh-oh, yeah,
that's-that's me.

20:39.488 --> 20:41.574
Yeah.

20:49.123 --> 20:51.084
(fire alarm ringing)

20:51.125 --> 20:52.793
Here we come.

20:52.835 --> 20:55.671
Whoo!
That was so cool.

20:55.713 --> 20:57.506
Whoo!
Let's go, girls!

20:57.548 --> 21:00.009
I can't believe we just
did that. So cool.

21:00.051 --> 21:01.385
(alarm continues ringing)

21:06.224 --> 21:08.142
(cheering)

21:08.184 --> 21:10.477
Oh, can we do that in public?

21:15.816 --> 21:17.110
BARTENDER:
Here you are.
Thanks.

21:17.151 --> 21:19.028
Thank you.

21:20.320 --> 21:24.117
So... I got you
a little gift, too.

21:24.158 --> 21:25.701
To prove how well I know you.

21:25.743 --> 21:28.204
You did not have to do that.

21:28.246 --> 21:31.373
I know I didn't have to.
I wanted to.

21:31.415 --> 21:33.209
Because I wanted
to see your face...

21:33.251 --> 21:34.293
(gasps)

21:34.334 --> 21:35.377
...when you opened it up.

21:35.419 --> 21:36.796
Ooh...

21:36.837 --> 21:38.714
(giggles)

21:43.219 --> 21:45.471
Ooh, wow.
What do you think?

21:45.512 --> 21:46.722
Do you love them?

21:46.764 --> 21:48.474
Are they my girl's best friend?

21:48.515 --> 21:52.061
Yes, they are gorgeous

21:52.103 --> 21:53.687
and big.

21:53.729 --> 21:56.315
Thank you.

21:56.356 --> 21:57.650
Let's see how they look.

21:57.691 --> 21:58.943
Yeah, okay.

22:02.947 --> 22:04.907
Beautiful.
Yeah?
Perfect.

22:04.949 --> 22:07.701
(giggles)

22:07.743 --> 22:11.747
(applause and cheering)

22:11.789 --> 22:14.834
Guys, there's, like,
a zillion people out here.

22:14.875 --> 22:17.253
Hell, yeah! We're gonna
rock this bitch!

22:17.295 --> 22:18.879
(cheering continues)

22:21.632 --> 22:22.758
You okay?

22:22.800 --> 22:24.635
Ade, what's wrong?

22:26.386 --> 22:28.764
I can't do this.

22:28.806 --> 22:30.016
What are you talking about?

22:31.309 --> 22:33.853
I have never sung
in front of a crowd like this.

22:33.894 --> 22:35.938
And I can't even take
a drink to calm down.

22:35.980 --> 22:38.440
No, don't worry, Ade.
You're going to be amazing.

22:38.482 --> 22:40.442
No, I'm sorry.
I just-- I can't do this.

22:40.484 --> 22:41.694
What do you mean

22:41.735 --> 22:43.112
you can't?

22:43.154 --> 22:45.031
I just can't.

22:45.072 --> 22:46.532
(crowd cheering)

22:46.573 --> 22:48.201
All right, girl...

22:48.242 --> 22:50.703
we are going to be
right behind you.

22:50.744 --> 22:52.538
You've just got
to face your fears.

22:52.579 --> 22:54.207
Don't think about
who's watching...

22:54.248 --> 22:55.833
Come on.
No, I'm sorry.

22:57.293 --> 22:58.294
Sing in my place.

22:59.586 --> 23:00.796
Please?

23:00.838 --> 23:01.964
No way.

23:02.006 --> 23:03.549
No.

23:03.590 --> 23:04.800
We're a band.

23:04.842 --> 23:06.552
All right?

23:06.593 --> 23:09.096
It's all for one...
and all that crap.

23:11.057 --> 23:12.516
She's right.

23:12.558 --> 23:15.311
We do it together,
or we don't do it at all.

23:15.353 --> 23:18.147
Guys, come on.
Not a chance.

23:18.189 --> 23:20.566
CAT: There'll be plenty
of other gigs.

23:20.607 --> 23:22.985
The important thing
is that we stick together.

23:24.862 --> 23:26.989
Put away the
puppy dog eyes.

23:27.031 --> 23:28.615
We're not gonna rock
this bitch without you.

23:38.584 --> 23:40.711
(applause and cheering)

23:44.757 --> 23:47.343

25:39.746 --> 25:41.499

Hey, don't worry.

25:44.626 --> 25:46.212

Mom, he's not a jerk.

Don't lie to me.

26:57.657 --> 26:59.326
What are you talking about?

27:00.618 --> 27:02.162
You're here 'cause...

27:02.204 --> 27:04.831
you have to make sure I won't
tell anyone your secret.

27:05.958 --> 27:08.419
That's not true. Okay?

27:08.461 --> 27:11.629
Despite everything,
I actually care about

27:11.671 --> 27:13.882
what happens to you.
But you don't love me.

27:13.924 --> 27:16.385
No.

27:16.427 --> 27:17.719
I don't.

27:17.761 --> 27:20.055
You should've just
left me there to die.

27:20.097 --> 27:21.599
No.

27:21.639 --> 27:24.602
Stop. Okay, just
stop manipulating me.

27:24.642 --> 27:25.727
I'm not.

27:25.769 --> 27:26.770
Yeah, you are.

27:26.812 --> 27:28.897
You have been from the start.

27:28.939 --> 27:31.066
I mean, even the way
we got together.

27:31.108 --> 27:33.110
You were just
preying on the fact

27:33.152 --> 27:35.070
that I felt so guilty
about your uncle.

27:35.112 --> 27:36.447
You should feel guilty.

27:36.489 --> 27:37.448
Don't worry.

27:37.490 --> 27:38.949
I do.

27:38.991 --> 27:41.160
Every day, I do.

27:41.201 --> 27:44.497
But I don't owe you
a relationship because of it.

27:45.831 --> 27:47.833
So then what
incentive is there

27:47.874 --> 27:49.960
to keep me from telling?

27:50.002 --> 27:52.212
None.

27:57.050 --> 27:59.011
Annie, everything I did,

27:59.052 --> 28:00.846
I have done it
because I love you.

28:02.515 --> 28:03.765
You have to know that.

28:03.807 --> 28:05.809
(sighs)

28:05.851 --> 28:07.769
I know that you think that,
Jasper.

28:07.811 --> 28:09.980
But what we had

28:10.022 --> 28:11.982
was all based on lies.

28:12.024 --> 28:13.317
It wasn't love.

28:13.359 --> 28:14.652
Yes, it was.

28:16.694 --> 28:18.572
It was.

28:20.324 --> 28:22.201
It was.

28:24.119 --> 28:27.540
And that's why I'm not
going to tell anyone.

28:27.581 --> 28:29.667
I'm never going to tell
your secret, ever.

28:31.335 --> 28:33.003

I'm sorry, but...
