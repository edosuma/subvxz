00:22.903 --> 00:26.936
- What are you doing?
- I thought you were at rounds.

00:27.135 --> 00:29.506
- What time is it?
- 6:35.

00:29.698 --> 00:34.081
Oh, God! Anspaugh's going to kill me.

00:34.315 --> 00:38.150
Where's my...? Give me my thing,
my stethoscope.

00:38.352 --> 00:39.981
Take mine.

00:47.455 --> 00:50.143
- Did you brush your teeth?
- Yes, Dad.

00:50.340 --> 00:52.547
- Did you floss?
- Yes.

00:52.745 --> 00:55.050
All right, I was just checking.

00:55.244 --> 00:58.030
I told you
I could make a good breakfast.

00:58.258 --> 01:01.743
- You're wearing your Brownie uniform.
- It's Thursday.

01:01.944 --> 01:04.816
Was I supposed to
talk to your troop today?

01:05.790 --> 01:08.697
I'm sorry,
I forgot to change my shift.

01:08.931 --> 01:11.718
- You promised.
- I have to work today.

01:11.943 --> 01:15.112
- Can I do it next week?
- I knew you'd forget.

01:17.264 --> 01:21.296
I don't work Saturday. We can go
to Six Flags, ride the roller coaster.

01:26.688 --> 01:28.698
Dr. Edson, present the case.

01:28.899 --> 01:34.177
The patient is fluid-overloaded.
I gave her a Lasix sandwich.

01:34.379 --> 01:36.937
Dr. Carter, how nice
of you to join us.

01:37.136 --> 01:40.207
What would you do with Mrs. Pritzker?

01:40.406 --> 01:45.083
- What's her problem?
- She is fluid-overloaded.

01:45.278 --> 01:48.699
Well, I wouldn't give her
anything to drink.

01:48.899 --> 01:51.904
Let's continue our
discussion of diuresis.

01:52.136 --> 01:55.557
Carter, what electrolyte imbalance
can result from Lasix?

01:55.726 --> 01:58.666
- Hypokalemia.
- Where does Lasix affect the kidney?

01:58.867 --> 02:01.425
- At the loop of Henle.
- Ascending or descending limb?

02:01.656 --> 02:04.246
- Ascending.
- Where does Lasix get its name?

02:08.066 --> 02:10.788
- I don't know.
- It lasts six hours.

02:13.451 --> 02:18.216
Dr. Ryke,
present the next patient, please.

02:18.420 --> 02:22.967
- Man, what did he have for breakfast?
- Me.

02:23.163 --> 02:26.715
- Hey, Carol! Good morning!
- Says who?

02:26.913 --> 02:32.104
- I won't ask how your day is going.
- I got my MCAT results.

02:32.266 --> 02:36.069
I shouldn't have taken the test.
I don't know what I was thinking.

02:36.304 --> 02:38.381
- Why didn't you talk me out of it?
- How bad did you do?

02:38.548 --> 02:41.105
I don't know. I haven't opened it.

02:41.305 --> 02:46.332
- Are you nuts? Open the envelope.
- I'm not in the mood for bad news.

02:46.529 --> 02:49.534
- I'll open that envelope.
- Doug! Give it back!

02:50.152 --> 02:54.052
- Does anybody have a letter opener?
- Don't you dare.

02:54.222 --> 02:57.610
- Good morning, Dr. Einstein.
- Excuse me?

02:57.844 --> 03:01.145
We have to move fast
to beat the other med schools.

03:01.305 --> 03:04.955
Your MCAT. I'm on the Admissions
Committee. They sent your scores.

03:05.151 --> 03:11.326
Don't consider the Ivy League
until you've looked at our program.

03:12.395 --> 03:16.526
- Oh, my God!
- Eighty-fifth percentile.

03:16.754 --> 03:21.104
Looks like Carol Hathaway's
going to medical school.

04:12.076 --> 04:15.661
- So you disappointed the Brownies.
- I forgot I had to work.

04:15.859 --> 04:19.442
- Tough being a doctor and a daddy.
- That's what Jen used to say.

04:19.641 --> 04:23.870
- Mark, you work on Saturday.
- I can't. I have plans with Rachel.

04:24.096 --> 04:26.718
There's no one else.
Walters and Foster are on vacation.

04:26.918 --> 04:28.808
- At the same time?
- Mark approved the schedule.

04:29.001 --> 04:31.590
- Can't you cover for me?
- I've got the graveyard.

04:31.788 --> 04:33.000
You blew it again.

04:35.442 --> 04:38.480
Put the lancet in the pen,
and push the trigger.

04:38.680 --> 04:41.106
Is this necessary?

04:41.308 --> 04:46.587
When you have gestational diabetes,
you have to test your blood every day.

04:47.943 --> 04:52.620
You calibrate the machine, put in
a strip and apply a drop of blood.

04:52.847 --> 04:55.404
Slow down.

04:55.603 --> 04:57.974
Blood glucose of 120
is where you want to be.

04:58.135 --> 05:03.994
One-sixty is too much. Anything
under 80 means you have to eat.

05:04.225 --> 05:07.908
Okay, 210. You need
a shot of insulin. Where is it?

05:08.072 --> 05:11.076
The nurse is bringing it.

05:11.277 --> 05:13.801
- She'll be here in a hour?
- No, at 10:00.

05:15.988 --> 05:19.475
Okay. You'll be fine.

05:20.700 --> 05:22.678
- I've got to go.
- Already?

05:22.912 --> 05:24.890
Yeah, I'm late for work.

05:30.028 --> 05:32.137
Just go.

05:38.489 --> 05:41.276
Carol, they need
a puke cleanup in 3.

05:41.438 --> 05:45.820
- Your puke-cleaning days are over.
- Reason enough to go to med school.

05:46.053 --> 05:49.092
Carol hit a home run on her MCAT.

05:49.323 --> 05:52.589
- Don't forget us.
- I haven't even applied yet.

05:52.753 --> 05:56.622
- Jerry, what are you doing?
- I saw a mouse by the elevator.

05:56.823 --> 06:02.462
Sounds like Heidi. Dr. Russel
lost a gene-knockout founder.

06:02.657 --> 06:06.657
A genetically-engineered mouse.
It's worth 500,000 bucks.

06:06.887 --> 06:09.925
- There's a $5000 reward.
- Dead or alive?

06:10.125 --> 06:13.130
Alive. It's worthless if it's dead.

06:14.452 --> 06:17.872
- Carol, can you watch the phones?
- It's not my job.

06:18.074 --> 06:19.832
I'm on break.

06:21.599 --> 06:25.184
No, no. Doctors don't do phones.

06:27.017 --> 06:29.771
- How were rounds?
- I got massacred.

06:29.965 --> 06:32.718
- Anspaugh?
- Exiled me down here.

06:32.914 --> 06:35.601
Ever since I second-guessed him,
he's been out to get me.

06:35.798 --> 06:39.448
- What are you doing?
- Practicing laparoscopic maneuvers.

06:39.645 --> 06:42.300
In case I ever get back into Surgery.

06:42.497 --> 06:44.289
- Can I try?
- Yeah.

06:45.639 --> 06:48.229
Put your hands
through those graspers...

06:48.428 --> 06:51.979
...and stack the dice
one on top of the other.

06:52.177 --> 06:54.548
- This is tricky.
- Wait till you tie knots.

06:55.831 --> 06:58.006
Carter, Benton needs you in Trauma 2.

06:58.203 --> 07:01.503
- Mind if I tag along?
- No, be my guest.

07:02.466 --> 07:06.532
Mrs. Meeks, it looks like you've got
a small fish bone down there.

07:07.979 --> 07:10.666
- Jerry, turn off the light.
- I'm looking for Heidi.

07:10.864 --> 07:14.514
- We're the only ones in here.
- Heidi's a mouse.

07:14.710 --> 07:17.814
- A mutant mouse.
- We're in the middle of an exam.

07:18.011 --> 07:19.836
There it is!

07:20.607 --> 07:23.875
Heidi, don't be afraid.

07:24.069 --> 07:26.244
Uncle Jerry won't hurt you.

07:26.473 --> 07:28.779
What'd you do that for?

07:28.941 --> 07:31.881
Here you go. Open wide.

07:32.114 --> 07:34.901
How much did you borrow
for med school?

07:35.127 --> 07:38.034
- 110 grand.
- Oh, my God!

07:38.236 --> 07:41.853
- How long did it take to pay off?
- I'll be paying it off for 15 years.

07:42.050 --> 07:45.799
- I've got a sick kid here.
- I couldn't wake him up.

07:46.025 --> 07:50.222
- How long was he down?
- Two minutes. Gave epi down the tube.

07:51.185 --> 07:55.633
Joel has a hypoplastic left heart.
They put a Blalock shunt in.

07:55.833 --> 07:58.226
- What's your name?
- Andrea Thompson.

07:58.429 --> 08:00.319
I'm Carol Hathaway. This is Dr. Ross.

08:00.513 --> 08:03.780
Give me an arm board and a
22-gauge angiocath. I'll start an IV.

08:04.006 --> 08:08.006
The surgeon's name was Lewis.
His cardiologist is Ferris.

08:08.173 --> 08:12.140
- Hook up a 12-lead and get an echo.
- He's on dig, Lasix and potassium.

08:12.340 --> 08:14.678
Chuny, escort Mrs. Thompson
out of here.

08:14.904 --> 08:17.275
Please, I want to stay. Carol?

08:18.398 --> 08:20.890
Okay, but stay back there.
We need to work.

08:21.026 --> 08:23.933
- I'm in. Bolus, 100 of saline.
- Did he clot off his shunt?

08:25.802 --> 08:27.494
He may have. Blood-gas kit.

08:27.693 --> 08:31.408
- What's that for?
- I don't have time to explain.

08:32.756 --> 08:35.664
- She shouldn't be in here.
- It's her child.

08:35.833 --> 08:37.976
Chuny, get this up to lab.

08:40.418 --> 08:43.620
Bullet missed the spine.
Renal artery intact.

08:43.783 --> 08:46.307
I want four-by-fours. He's bleeding.

08:46.539 --> 08:50.955
Dr. Benton, Carla Reece on the phone.
She says it's an emergency.

08:51.155 --> 08:53.875
- Damn! It's not working.
- Where's the source?

08:54.040 --> 08:57.590
- Soft-tissue arterioles.
- Lost the BP.

08:57.790 --> 09:00.379
- He's bleeding out.
- Give me a Foley and some saline.

09:00.578 --> 09:01.824
What are you going to do?

09:02.021 --> 09:06.371
If I insert the Foley and inflate
the balloon, the bleeding might stop.

09:09.040 --> 09:12.428
- Foley going in.
- Inject the saline.

09:12.630 --> 09:14.520
Did you learn this in
<i>Journal of Trauma</i> ?

09:14.713 --> 09:20.386
<i>People Magazine.</i> A girl got stuck
in a well trying to rescue her puppy.

09:20.611 --> 09:22.818
- What happened to the puppy?
- Don't ask.

09:23.880 --> 09:27.334
- He's coming around.
- Let's get him back over.

09:27.534 --> 09:30.507
Let's get him up to the O.R.
Good work, Carter.

09:31.284 --> 09:33.110
Is this the gunshot? We'll take it.

09:33.304 --> 09:35.129
- Can I scrub in?
- We've got it.

09:35.708 --> 09:40.898
Carter tamponaded the bleeding
with a Foley, saved his life.

09:41.124 --> 09:44.774
Edson, take his history
and get him prepped. Let's go.

09:45.708 --> 09:49.576
- You can't win them all.
- Man, are you in the doghouse!

09:51.638 --> 09:54.511
Got the blood gas, 7.23. PO-2's 90.

09:54.715 --> 09:57.141
- Call Respiratory for a vent.
- Lost his pulse.

09:57.311 --> 10:00.032
- What's wrong?
- Chest-tube tray, tension pneumo.

10:00.228 --> 10:02.370
- What are you doing?
- Eighteen French.

10:02.567 --> 10:04.774
- What's happening?
- His lung collapsed.

10:04.971 --> 10:07.430
- What's he doing?
- Putting in a chest tube.

10:07.632 --> 10:10.505
- Why are you cutting him?
- Carol, poke a Kelly in here.

10:10.741 --> 10:12.631
IV's infiltrated.

10:12.824 --> 10:16.507
- We'll do a femoral cutdown.
- Can you tell me what's going on?

10:16.702 --> 10:19.226
- Cutdown tray, please.
- Carol?

10:20.164 --> 10:24.131
- Come with me. I'll explain it.
- I want to stay with my baby.

10:24.363 --> 10:27.434
Not now. The doctor needs to work.

10:31.735 --> 10:35.001
We've put a chest tube in
to re-expand his lung.

10:35.197 --> 10:38.551
Dr. Ross is putting fluids
through a catheter in his leg.

10:38.754 --> 10:43.136
- When he's done, can I come back?
- Yes, but wait here right now.

10:44.395 --> 10:48.461
If he gets sicker, come and get me.

10:48.626 --> 10:50.964
I don't want my baby to die alone.

10:52.248 --> 10:54.641
I will.

11:04.685 --> 11:08.006
- What are those things?
- Humane traps from the lab.

11:08.242 --> 11:11.696
- We're trying to trap a mouse.
- Can you move them off the counter?

11:11.864 --> 11:15.547
- Call an exterminator.
- The mouse is worth 500,000 bucks.

11:15.743 --> 11:20.158
- Got a hot one. Brenda Smythe.
- What's the problem?

11:20.358 --> 11:22.084
- Voil ð.
- My wife and I were camping.

11:22.281 --> 11:26.346
I needed to urinate
and found this old bucket.

11:26.575 --> 11:28.783
- Why didn't you go into the bushes?
- That's irrelevant.

11:28.980 --> 11:31.472
- And you are?
- Her husband, John Smythe. And you?

11:31.639 --> 11:33.847
Mark Greene.

11:36.480 --> 11:39.999
- Is Joel all right?
- His blood pressure's up.

11:40.198 --> 11:42.568
- Is he conscious?
- Not yet.

11:42.763 --> 11:46.511
- I want to talk to the doctor.
- He's doing an echocardiogram.

11:46.768 --> 11:50.123
Joel got fluids and will
regain consciousness soon.

11:50.295 --> 11:53.496
I want to be there when he wakes up.

11:54.398 --> 11:57.883
I'll come and get you
as soon as Dr. Ross finishes the test.

12:03.693 --> 12:06.829
Can I get you a cup of coffee
or something to eat?

12:07.635 --> 12:11.700
No. Thank you, Carol.

12:18.821 --> 12:21.159
Why did you let Edson
steal your thunder?

12:21.385 --> 12:24.652
- It's not like I had a choice.
- You made the save.

12:24.815 --> 12:27.570
When Anspaugh gives an order,
you smile and nod.

12:27.763 --> 12:32.243
You couldn't pay me enough
to be a surgeon. Too cutthroat.

12:32.475 --> 12:37.185
- They're all jerks. No offense.
- None taken.

12:37.379 --> 12:40.865
Could you get me some crutches?
I saw some in the hall.

12:45.970 --> 12:49.904
Carla, I can't just take off.
Can't you call another nurse?

12:50.135 --> 12:55.512
Okay, just calm down. I'll be there.
I'll pick up some insulin.

12:55.681 --> 12:58.621
- Everything all right?
- Listen, I've got to go.

12:58.855 --> 13:01.346
If you have any problems,
check with Greene or Weaver.

13:01.515 --> 13:05.067
And check on my post-ops.
I'll be back in an hour.

13:06.547 --> 13:09.781
- I'm sorry, it's really stuck.
- It must've created a vacuum.

13:09.945 --> 13:12.315
- What do you intend to do?
- I'm thinking.

13:12.508 --> 13:15.481
Maybe we could grease up a Foley
and slide it in?

13:15.682 --> 13:19.944
I need a church key. A can opener.
Maybe the kitchen has one.

13:20.137 --> 13:23.853
Miss Wilkerson has a Swiss army knife.

13:24.080 --> 13:26.637
I thought you said her name
was Smythe.

13:27.702 --> 13:29.810
Pet name.

13:39.465 --> 13:42.152
Here's your bucket, Mr. Smythe.

13:43.920 --> 13:45.745
Thank you, doctor.

13:50.651 --> 13:54.618
Carter? It's Gunderson.
You admitted him through ER, right?

13:54.786 --> 13:56.545
He's tachycardic.
BP's down to 60 palp.

13:56.740 --> 14:00.576
- Any surgical complications?
- No. Suddenly he started gasping.

14:00.778 --> 14:03.270
- What's he on?
- Morphine and Ancef.

14:05.650 --> 14:07.312
His tongue's swollen.

14:07.509 --> 14:09.848
- What's going on?
- Looks like an allergic reaction.

14:10.075 --> 14:11.987
- Where's Edson?
- In Surgery.

14:12.158 --> 14:16.605
Let's give epi, 3 mls of 1 in 10,000.
IV. Get me a trach kit.

14:16.806 --> 14:19.527
He's in respiratory arrest. Betadine!

14:21.613 --> 14:23.023
Needle.

14:24.947 --> 14:26.859
Introducer.

14:29.177 --> 14:31.669
SAT's falling.

14:32.992 --> 14:37.669
I'm in. Hook him up. Pull Edson out of
Surgery. I want to talk to him now.

14:39.274 --> 14:42.825
- BP's up to 80.
- Look, the little guy's waking up.

14:43.056 --> 14:47.154
Hi, Joel. Don't be afraid.
Your mommy's right outside.

14:47.319 --> 14:50.390
Still got a few PVCs.
Give him another 10 of procainamide.

14:50.588 --> 14:54.391
- Can we bring the mother back in?
- Wait till the procainamide kicks in.

14:54.595 --> 14:57.666
Carol, I've got a case for you.
Pseudocyst with acute pancreatitis.

14:57.896 --> 15:00.584
- I've got to push some meds.
- Let the nurses do that.

15:00.781 --> 15:03.338
Let us lifers push meds.
Go play doctor.

15:03.506 --> 15:05.931
Go ahead, he's doing fine.

15:06.133 --> 15:09.969
As soon as he's stable,
bring the mom in.

15:10.171 --> 15:15.232
She's got the biggest pseudocyst
I've ever appreciated.

15:15.461 --> 15:20.422
They were going to send a nurse
at 4:00, but I didn't want to wait.

15:20.588 --> 15:22.796
You did the right thing by calling me.

15:22.993 --> 15:25.900
- I'm sorry you had to leave work.
- It's okay.

15:26.102 --> 15:30.168
Pull your robe back.
I have to inject in your thigh.

15:30.364 --> 15:34.365
- How often do I have to do this?
- Twice a day. Are you watching?

15:34.596 --> 15:38.214
Stick the needle in and push.

15:38.699 --> 15:41.485
- There you go.
- I hate the push part.

15:41.711 --> 15:44.334
Can you do this by yourself
the next time?

15:44.565 --> 15:49.427
- Are you going back to the hospital?
- Yeah, I have to get back to work.

15:49.565 --> 15:53.531
Eat something in a couple of hours.
Your blood sugar mustn't be too low.

15:53.763 --> 15:57.118
Oh, gosh!
I have to go to the grocery store.

15:57.321 --> 16:01.004
- You're not supposed to stand up.
- What else am I supposed to do?

16:01.231 --> 16:04.882
- What about your sister?
- Her little one's got strep.

16:05.077 --> 16:09.688
I can be down there
and back in 15 minutes.

16:11.649 --> 16:13.627
- I'll do it.
- Peter, no.

16:13.860 --> 16:17.575
- Go back to work, please.
- Carla, I said I'll do it.

16:18.732 --> 16:20.524
Never mind if you're
going to get snippy.

16:25.399 --> 16:27.474
Who are you calling?

16:27.675 --> 16:33.762
This is Dr. Benton. Tell Anspaugh
that I'm taking a personal day.

16:33.988 --> 16:38.087
No, I don't need to speak to him.
Just give him the message, please.

16:46.392 --> 16:50.590
- What happened?
- Anaphylaxis. He almost died.

16:50.783 --> 16:54.106
- What did you give him post-op?
- Ancef.

16:54.277 --> 16:56.453
- He's allergic to it.
- What?

16:56.649 --> 16:59.916
He's allergic to the
antibiotic you gave him.

17:00.112 --> 17:04.012
- Didn't you take a history?
- I thought you took one.

17:04.214 --> 17:08.377
Don't give me that crap.
Anspaugh told you to do it.

17:08.604 --> 17:12.407
I took a full history. The patient
never mentioned any allergies.

17:12.611 --> 17:17.125
Then why is this space
under allergies blank?

17:17.324 --> 17:21.837
You'd better think up an answer.
Anspaugh's going to want one.

17:25.560 --> 17:28.315
- Ow!
- Just a little bit further.

17:28.510 --> 17:31.613
There we go!

17:47.259 --> 17:53.379
We've an excellent faculty. Two Nobel
laureates and the best attendings.

17:53.542 --> 17:57.705
- What are the causes of pancreatitis?
- You're putting me on the spot.

17:57.901 --> 18:02.164
If you're going to be a med student,
you better get used to it.

18:02.356 --> 18:05.974
- Alcohol and gallstones?
- Excellent. Now you try.

18:09.728 --> 18:11.903
- Can you feel the pseudocyst?
- I'm not sure.

18:12.133 --> 18:13.345
- Ow!
- Sorry.

18:13.511 --> 18:16.833
- Use both hands, and press harder.
- Sorry, sorry.

18:17.068 --> 18:19.276
- Like this.
- Ow!

18:19.440 --> 18:20.718
Sorry.

18:20.947 --> 18:23.122
- Can you feel the cyst?
- I think so.

18:23.286 --> 18:27.898
Order 2 more units of blood
for the kid in Trauma 1.

18:28.094 --> 18:31.481
Wait, I want to teach you
how to do an ultrasound!

18:32.613 --> 18:35.968
- His SATs are falling.
- He thrombosed his shunt.

18:36.172 --> 18:37.931
We've lost the rhythm.

18:38.126 --> 18:39.755
- How long's he been down?
- Ten minutes.

18:39.953 --> 18:42.543
Why didn't you get his mother?
I'm getting her.

18:42.774 --> 18:44.468
- I don't want her in here.
- I promised.

18:44.665 --> 18:48.217
I've got this boy's heart in my hands.
I don't want her here.

18:48.415 --> 18:50.721
I'm getting her.

18:53.544 --> 18:55.784
- Is Joel awake?
- Come quick!

18:55.947 --> 19:01.708
Joel's gone into cardiac arrest.
They've opened his chest.

19:01.909 --> 19:07.286
Andrea, it's really bloody in there.
Are you sure you want to see this?

19:07.486 --> 19:08.797
Okay, come on.

19:14.955 --> 19:17.326
Time of death?

19:17.518 --> 19:23.279
- 11:52.
- Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

19:35.148 --> 19:38.153
- I thought he was going to make it.
- I feel awful.

19:38.352 --> 19:41.324
- I promised not to let him die alone.
- There was no way of knowing.

19:41.527 --> 19:46.203
I should have been there. Instead,
I was off appreciating a cyst.

19:46.397 --> 19:49.916
- Dr. Ross? Kid with a fever in 5.
- Do you want to do this?

19:50.148 --> 19:53.502
No, I'm not done yet.

20:00.341 --> 20:02.034
Andrea, I'm so sorry.

20:02.777 --> 20:05.202
I called the mortuary.
They're on the their way.

20:06.302 --> 20:09.439
What am I going to do
with all his clothes?

20:10.470 --> 20:12.929
I can give them to my sister.

20:14.060 --> 20:17.775
Would you like to see him?
Hold him one last time?

20:18.001 --> 20:21.236
- The doctor closed his wound.
- I have to make a call.

20:21.431 --> 20:24.337
The call can wait.

20:26.270 --> 20:29.691
Andrea, I know this is hard...

20:29.892 --> 20:33.411
...but I've learned that parents
need to say goodbye.

20:40.374 --> 20:42.320
Come on.

20:45.277 --> 20:47.453
I'll stitch you up in no time,
Mr. McCollum.

20:47.649 --> 20:51.518
- Leg hurts like hell.
- I'll get some lidocaine.

20:52.329 --> 20:54.754
Hey, what kind of dump is this?

20:55.502 --> 20:57.261
- It's a rat!
- That's Jerry's mouse.

20:57.490 --> 21:00.757
- Tomorrow I'm bringing my cat.
- This place should be closed down.

21:00.951 --> 21:03.093
I could use the time off.

21:03.291 --> 21:06.330
- What's wrong?
- My foot!

21:06.497 --> 21:10.081
Damn it! It's one of Jerry's traps.
Wendy, grab hold.

21:10.278 --> 21:12.901
I'm going to count.
One, two, three...

21:13.837 --> 21:16.973
- It's not coming.
- Where are the wire cutters?

21:17.170 --> 21:20.820
Tell Jerry to get these things
out of here before I kill him.

21:21.017 --> 21:23.256
Where's Benton?
He should've been back hours ago.

21:23.453 --> 21:26.010
- I heard he took a personal day.
- Dr. Benton?

21:26.240 --> 21:31.912
Carter, Dale alerted me that
Mr. Gunderson had a crisis earlier.

21:32.138 --> 21:35.526
- I'm glad he told you.
- Anyone have his chart?

21:39.830 --> 21:44.727
Nasty little anaphylactic reaction.
You think it was caused by...?

21:44.895 --> 21:48.283
The antibiotic
given post-operatively. Ancef.

21:48.484 --> 21:51.271
Doesn't look like there was anything
we could have done.

21:52.972 --> 21:55.944
- Excuse me?
- Patient states, "No drug allergies."

21:56.146 --> 21:57.937
- Is that your handwriting?
- Yes, sir.

21:58.901 --> 22:01.076
- Can I take a look?
- Certainly.

22:01.241 --> 22:06.553
A thorough history, the best defense
against malpractice. Good work.

22:16.530 --> 22:19.087
I thought this would be
more comfortable.

22:19.287 --> 22:20.816
Thank you.

22:22.844 --> 22:25.369
Do you want to hold him?

22:45.409 --> 22:47.966
You take all the time you need.

23:11.788 --> 23:16.553
- You're back.
- He got a button stuck up his nose.

23:16.724 --> 23:18.767
Unusual. How did it get there?

23:18.968 --> 23:22.651
I was wiping my nose on my cuff
when I had to sneeze...

23:22.846 --> 23:24.823
...and I inhaled the button.

23:25.058 --> 23:28.129
- The button's still on his cuff.
- He changed his shirt.

23:28.295 --> 23:31.464
Perhaps an ear, nose and throat
specialist is in order?

23:31.660 --> 23:36.043
- Why don't you lie back?
- What are you doing, doctor?

23:36.244 --> 23:41.556
Hold the unblocked nostril closed
while I put this mask over your mouth.

23:41.789 --> 23:45.210
Haleh, hold the basin under his chin.
Just relax.

23:48.392 --> 23:50.665
Very impressive.

23:51.629 --> 23:53.805
- May I keep the button?
- Sure.

23:54.001 --> 23:56.787
I'll get your discharge papers.

23:58.841 --> 24:02.906
Get a Psych consult down here
before they hurt themselves.

24:07.591 --> 24:10.596
- I'd take the turkey tetrazzini.
- Hey, Jackie.

24:10.765 --> 24:12.907
- What are you doing here?
- Shopping.

24:13.136 --> 24:15.924
- In the afternoon?
- I took today off.

24:16.149 --> 24:20.827
- Peter, you never take a day off.
- I had to. Carla needed me.

24:20.989 --> 24:25.021
- Is she all right?
- She just needs to stay off her feet.

24:25.220 --> 24:28.936
- Boy, are you in trouble!
- It's just for today.

24:29.162 --> 24:31.949
A pregnant woman needs a lot of help.

24:32.175 --> 24:36.437
When I was pregnant with Steven,
Walt did the cooking and the laundry.

24:36.630 --> 24:39.253
It's crazy. It's like
she's a different woman.

24:39.451 --> 24:41.047
It's just the hormones.

24:41.278 --> 24:45.563
One time, Walt switched the channel
in the middle of <i>Oprah.</i>

24:45.765 --> 24:49.481
I chased him out of the house
with a croquet mallet.

24:49.676 --> 24:51.502
Well, I'm losing it.

24:51.695 --> 24:56.077
I'm so proud of you, taking a day off
to help her out like this.

24:56.214 --> 24:59.088
Will you be able
to take more time off?

24:59.323 --> 25:02.492
I don't know.
I hadn't thought about that.

25:02.689 --> 25:06.274
Who's Carla going to depend on
if you're not around?

25:07.913 --> 25:09.704
Yeah.

25:09.901 --> 25:15.408
Come on. Let's go down to the baby
section. You've got a lot to learn.

25:19.067 --> 25:21.111
Looks like he got him
with an ice pick.

25:21.343 --> 25:23.769
- I'll undress him.
- Let Chuny do that.

25:23.939 --> 25:26.278
I want you to assess the patient.

25:26.472 --> 25:29.476
Start with the ABCs, Dr. Hathaway.

25:31.952 --> 25:35.253
His airway is patent.

25:35.446 --> 25:37.817
He's breathing shallow, appearance
dusky. I'll get the intubation tray.

25:38.010 --> 25:40.283
Chuny can do it.
You're going to intubate.

25:42.722 --> 25:48.776
Take a breath and hold it. If you run
out of breath, you're taking too long.

25:48.940 --> 25:53.203
Enter laterally, sweeping the tongue
out of the way. Don't rock back.

25:53.427 --> 25:56.301
Can you see the epiglottis? Good.

25:56.472 --> 26:00.855
Now visualize the cords.
Can you see them?

26:01.056 --> 26:03.449
- Pulse ox is falling, 89.
- You're doing great.

26:03.652 --> 26:07.520
Make sure you lift the scope
45 degrees.

26:11.281 --> 26:14.352
Good job. Let's get him to X-ray.

26:18.364 --> 26:22.648
- Looks like Kerry's got a new pet.
- Stop it, Chuny.

26:22.883 --> 26:28.293
- She jammed the button up his nose?
- And she had a bucket on her butt.

26:28.461 --> 26:30.853
- What's wrong with them?
- Sounds like they're nuts.

26:31.057 --> 26:35.733
- Button-extraction response time?
- 7.5 minutes.

26:35.929 --> 26:40.409
- This is Dr. Pomerantz.
- Psychiatric consult, I presume?

26:40.608 --> 26:42.685
We've been expecting you.

26:42.916 --> 26:47.014
As you probably have ascertained,
we're not what we appear to be.

26:47.755 --> 26:51.722
- What are you?
- John Smythe and Brenda Wilkerson.

26:51.923 --> 26:53.299
Clinical researchers.

26:53.493 --> 26:56.465
We're doing a study on problem solving
in emergency departments...

26:56.666 --> 27:00.731
...and foreign-body extractions elicit
the greatest range of responses.

27:00.897 --> 27:06.624
And you came up with the most
innovative solutions we've ever seen.

27:06.827 --> 27:10.181
At Mercy, the button in the nose
took five hours and two consults.

27:10.385 --> 27:12.210
They wanted to operate.

27:13.205 --> 27:16.560
Just who is sponsoring this study?

27:17.532 --> 27:23.040
An independent consortium of health
care professionals and the government.

27:23.206 --> 27:26.112
The highest levels of government.

27:27.661 --> 27:31.562
No promises, but you might be
contacted by H.R.C.

27:34.103 --> 27:35.995
Hillary.

27:37.918 --> 27:41.568
If she gets her ass stuck in a bucket,
she'll know who to call.

27:41.764 --> 27:43.839
I'll tell her you said so.

27:56.635 --> 27:59.095
- What are you doing down here?
- Hiding.

27:59.329 --> 28:00.989
Me too.

28:01.187 --> 28:05.219
- You're a smoker!
- A secret smoker. Don't tell anyone.

28:06.540 --> 28:08.715
- Who died?
- What?

28:08.912 --> 28:11.087
Why the long face?

28:12.855 --> 28:17.204
Edson falsified a chart
to cover his ass.

28:17.406 --> 28:20.061
He forgot to take a patient's history.

28:20.259 --> 28:24.226
- Anspaugh must have roasted his butt.
- I didn't tell him.

28:25.579 --> 28:27.623
You didn't?

28:27.855 --> 28:30.708
- Would you have?
- Hell, yeah!

28:30.899 --> 28:34.451
Changing a chart's unethical,
not to mention illegal.

28:36.092 --> 28:39.294
Surgeons don't rat on each other.
It's like the Marines:

28:39.809 --> 28:43.012
- "All for one, and one for all."
- That's the Three Musketeers.

28:44.907 --> 28:47.399
You know what I mean.

28:47.567 --> 28:50.156
You've got to be a team player.

28:50.356 --> 28:53.906
Anspaugh gave me
that lecture last week.

28:54.106 --> 28:55.701
I think you're scared.

29:00.933 --> 29:05.413
- Well, we'll be in touch.
- Bye, Super Doc.

29:06.510 --> 29:09.384
- What a couple of kooks!
- They could make you famous.

29:09.555 --> 29:13.074
You could be known as the most
innovative doctor in the country.

29:13.273 --> 29:17.306
Tell that to my daughter.
I stood up her Brownie troop.

29:17.504 --> 29:21.340
I know, I know.
I just can't seem to get it together.

29:21.542 --> 29:26.766
Super Doc can't figure out a way
to keep his Brownie commitments?

29:32.633 --> 29:36.862
Carol, an intoxicated gentleman
needs an NG tube. Interested?

29:37.088 --> 29:39.743
- You can't go in there.
- Why not? There's a free bed.

29:39.940 --> 29:42.213
She needs to be alone.
Her child died today.

29:44.620 --> 29:49.581
Your compassion is admirable, but we
have to put our patients somewhere.

29:49.780 --> 29:52.982
- Treat the drunk in the hall.
- He's a patient too.

29:53.210 --> 29:55.931
- You've done it before.
- When there were no beds.

29:56.126 --> 29:59.197
Well, there aren't any beds now.

29:59.363 --> 30:04.806
If you're going to be a med student,
stop thinking like a nurse.

30:05.036 --> 30:07.015
I'm not a med student yet.

30:19.716 --> 30:23.170
CBC, Chem-7. Type and cross for four.

30:23.371 --> 30:26.507
- Is this a surgical belly?
- I already called upstairs.

30:26.737 --> 30:28.879
- Might as well get started.
- What's the story?

30:29.044 --> 30:34.683
- A painter fell 20 feet onto a Volvo.
- They say Volvos are the safest cars.

30:35.294 --> 30:38.945
Edson, start a central line.
Carter, do a peritoneal lavage.

30:39.140 --> 30:41.315
I'll get the DPL kit.

30:42.699 --> 30:46.983
Carter, what's the criteria for a
positive diagnostic peritoneal lavage?

30:47.154 --> 30:50.989
Red blood cell count greater than
100,000. White greater than 500.

30:51.192 --> 30:56.470
And if you can read a newspaper
through the fluid, it's negative.

30:58.179 --> 31:03.043
Dale, weren't you giving Dr. Anspaugh
new information about Gunderson?

31:04.044 --> 31:07.913
- John filled me in.
- The allergic reaction?

31:08.147 --> 31:13.590
I called Mr. Gunderson's mother
and briefed her on the situation.

31:13.756 --> 31:18.750
- She's flying in from Louisville.
- Good. Caring for the patient.

31:18.950 --> 31:21.124
Is that it?

31:22.058 --> 31:24.713
- That's it.
- Really? John said there was more.

31:26.642 --> 31:28.467
Something I should know about?

31:33.822 --> 31:35.068
No.

31:36.002 --> 31:39.969
- DPL's positive.
- Let's get him up to surgery.

31:40.168 --> 31:45.228
Edson, you start with an ex-lap. If he
needs a splenectomy, you'll do it.

31:48.566 --> 31:51.353
Well, you sure told him.

31:59.079 --> 32:02.379
- Liar, liar, pants on fire.
- Save it.

32:02.573 --> 32:05.709
- Do they teach forgery at Harvard?
- Go to hell.

32:05.937 --> 32:07.566
What did you say?

32:07.764 --> 32:10.933
I just adjusted the chart.
Is that such a big deal?

32:11.098 --> 32:13.437
Run it by Anspaugh.
See what he thinks.

32:14.528 --> 32:17.402
- I can't do that.
- Sure you can.

32:19.272 --> 32:22.310
If this goes on my record,
my chances of a fellowship are zilch.

32:23.053 --> 32:27.054
- Are you going to make me tell him?
- John, please.

32:30.842 --> 32:35.127
I'll do anything you want. I'll put in
a good word with Anspaugh.

32:35.330 --> 32:37.155
I'll make it up to you.

32:38.664 --> 32:41.450
I don't want to have anything
to do with you.

32:41.676 --> 32:46.156
If you ever try anything like this
again, I'll bury you.

32:46.387 --> 32:48.300
That's a promise.

32:49.721 --> 32:51.513
These are resuscitation paddles.

32:51.709 --> 32:54.943
If someone's heart
stops beating normally...

32:55.137 --> 33:00.963
...we zap them with electricity
to start it. It's like Frankenstein.

33:01.163 --> 33:04.585
Got an MVA coming in. Kerry's got it,
but we need the room.

33:04.786 --> 33:09.813
Who wants to look at blood cells under
the microscope? Let's go to the lab.

33:14.465 --> 33:16.706
Thanks, Dad.

33:20.138 --> 33:22.531
- Very creative.
- So I've been told.

33:22.735 --> 33:26.571
Would you like to go out with the most
innovative doctor in the world?

33:26.742 --> 33:29.299
- You like bowling?
- "Like" may be too strong a word.

33:29.497 --> 33:31.411
I have to take Rachel.
Can Emma come too?

33:31.613 --> 33:34.235
- Oh, it's that kind of date.
- The best I can do.

33:34.434 --> 33:38.084
- I'll dust off my bowling shoes.
- You own bowling shoes?

33:38.281 --> 33:42.543
There's all sorts of things
you don't know about me, doctor.

33:59.083 --> 34:03.180
Thank you for letting me have
this time with my baby.

34:03.378 --> 34:07.662
- Is there someone I can call?
- My sister's on her way.

34:10.043 --> 34:13.694
I used to say this prayer with Joel
every night:

34:15.492 --> 34:18.399
Now I lay me down to sleep.

34:18.601 --> 34:22.284
I pray the Lord my soul to keep.

34:22.480 --> 34:28.272
If I should die before I wake,
I pray the Lord my soul to take.

34:52.449 --> 34:54.819
You think I'm a coward?

34:55.942 --> 34:58.085
Who am I to say? I'm not a surgeon.

34:59.213 --> 35:01.770
You've got your own rules.

35:01.937 --> 35:06.035
Maybe that's a load of crap,
and I'm hiding behind it.

35:08.219 --> 35:10.524
I don't know what to do.

35:10.718 --> 35:13.921
- Talk to another surgeon.
- Right, they're all so empathetic.

35:14.116 --> 35:16.903
There's got to be somebody
whose judgment you trust.

35:18.571 --> 35:21.096
- Should I talk to Benton?
- I would.

35:24.629 --> 35:27.022
- How about a Heinie?
- A beer?

35:27.194 --> 35:29.816
I keep a couple in the back
for when I get off work.

35:31.616 --> 35:33.954
You know, you're great.

35:34.534 --> 35:37.321
- So are you.
- Seriously.

35:38.411 --> 35:43.089
And you're honest, funny, beautiful.

35:45.880 --> 35:47.770
I don't suppose that you...?

35:49.406 --> 35:50.783
Not a chance.

35:53.476 --> 35:56.678
- Well, cheers.
- Cheers.

35:58.604 --> 36:01.511
These things cost 60 bucks.
Who's going to pay for it?

36:01.681 --> 36:06.294
- Take it out of your reward.
- No trap, no mouse, no reward.

36:10.175 --> 36:13.923
- He's under there.
- She's under there?

36:17.483 --> 36:20.838
Oh, no! You killed her.

36:21.042 --> 36:24.725
- I didn't mean to.
- She's still breathing.

36:24.919 --> 36:26.744
- How much is that reward?
- Five grand.

36:27.483 --> 36:32.030
Wendy, get a small pediatric
O-2 mask and 5 cc's of Dopram.

36:32.259 --> 36:35.428
Jerry, start
mouth-to-mouth resuscitation.

36:35.625 --> 36:37.832
I worked for a vet
who resuscitated a guinea pig.

36:37.998 --> 36:42.160
- I'm not breathing in a rat's mouth.
- I will, but we split the reward.

36:42.356 --> 36:45.394
Hook the mask up to 5 liters O-2.

36:56.202 --> 36:57.961
She moved!

36:59.056 --> 37:02.640
- I think she's going to be all right.
- I'll take her up to the lab.

37:02.933 --> 37:04.725
- Nothing doing.
- Give me the rat.

37:04.921 --> 37:08.309
I'll take her back
and collect the reward.

37:08.478 --> 37:13.342
I'll give you 10 percent for being in
the room while we resuscitated her.

37:14.568 --> 37:15.814
Damn it!

37:16.010 --> 37:19.245
I'm heading out.
Is Dr. Benton coming tomorrow?

37:19.441 --> 37:24.467
Yes. We're sending over his surgery
schedule and charts by messenger.

37:24.697 --> 37:26.708
- Is this them?
- Yep.

37:26.876 --> 37:29.247
He must have moved.

37:29.472 --> 37:33.472
Cancel the messenger. I'll take these
to him. I have to talk to him.

37:35.017 --> 37:38.635
- Lily, are you up for nurses night?
- Sure.

37:38.833 --> 37:42.285
- Jenny, how about you?
- Be there or be square.

37:42.486 --> 37:45.786
I hear you intubated a guy
like a pro today.

37:45.979 --> 37:50.263
Kerry has been showing me things
all day. Made me feel like a beginner.

37:51.556 --> 37:56.136
The truth is,
I'm really, really good at my job.

37:56.364 --> 37:59.632
So why do I want to change that?

38:08.929 --> 38:10.338
Watch me, Mom!

38:17.871 --> 38:22.221
- Good try, honey! What's the score?
- 2-1, still.

38:22.423 --> 38:26.422
We could be here all night.
Did you get all your paperwork done?

38:26.621 --> 38:30.784
I'm going to be up late tonight, but I
can access my patient reports on-line.

38:31.429 --> 38:33.669
Figured it's worth it.

38:34.731 --> 38:36.622
Easy, honey!

38:41.687 --> 38:44.080
Think they're getting along okay?

38:44.955 --> 38:47.294
I think there's something there.

38:48.577 --> 38:50.368
Yeah?

38:51.494 --> 38:55.909
- We should do this more often.
- Next time without kids.

38:56.111 --> 38:59.432
- You read my mind.
- That's my job.

39:05.309 --> 39:10.138
- Dad! I got one!
- That is really great.

39:10.373 --> 39:11.804
There we go. It's 2-2.

39:14.989 --> 39:18.639
One plate
of spaghetti marinara al dente.

39:19.924 --> 39:21.585
Just one plate?

39:21.783 --> 39:26.493
Hospital's sending over some charts,
so I have to go home and prepare.

39:26.719 --> 39:29.277
- Why don't you do it here?
- I don't have my books.

39:29.508 --> 39:31.519
I'm gonna need another shot in an hour.

39:32.168 --> 39:34.113
That's why I taught you how to do it.

39:36.912 --> 39:39.819
Fine. Just go home.

39:44.476 --> 39:47.351
Look, Carla...

39:49.348 --> 39:51.326
I can't be here all the time.

39:51.496 --> 39:54.567
- You wanted to be involved.
- I am.

39:54.797 --> 39:58.961
On your terms, as always.
Ever think about what I want?

39:59.156 --> 40:01.812
- You never ask me what I want.
- What do you mean?

40:02.009 --> 40:04.981
- Nothing. Just drop it.
- Uh-uh.

40:05.214 --> 40:07.804
- You never wanted this baby.
- I didn't say that.

40:08.003 --> 40:09.916
No, but that's what you meant.

40:10.118 --> 40:14.118
Go home. I don't need you here
doing me no favors.

40:15.471 --> 40:18.574
- What?!
- Hey, Carla.

40:18.804 --> 40:21.361
It's for you.

40:24.766 --> 40:28.449
- Carter, what are you doing here?
- I just came to drop these by.

40:29.702 --> 40:32.161
Thank you. Good night, Carter.

40:46.113 --> 40:50.178
- Hey! I didn't expect to see you.
- It's nurses night out, right?

40:50.408 --> 40:53.642
I thought Weaver was fitting you
for a lab coat.

40:53.773 --> 40:56.746
White adds 10 pounds,
so I'll stick to pink.

40:56.978 --> 41:00.782
- You're having second thoughts?
- Let's just say I like what I do.

41:00.985 --> 41:05.116
- Another round?
- I'll get it.

41:05.889 --> 41:08.162
- You want to play?
- Sure.

41:08.357 --> 41:10.695
- Come on, girl.
- It's a quarter a ball.

41:10.889 --> 41:13.260
I think I can handle that.

41:13.485 --> 41:17.551
All right. What am I, stripes?

41:18.197 --> 41:19.793
Two, in the corner.
