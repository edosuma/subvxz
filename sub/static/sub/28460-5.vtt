00:04.801 --> 00:06.902
_

00:08.529 --> 00:10.434
Everything looks good.

00:10.469 --> 00:12.769
- Do you want to know the sex?
- No, no.

00:12.805 --> 00:14.304
We agreed we didn't want to find out.

00:14.356 --> 00:16.218
It was just so much fun
the first time, you know,

00:16.242 --> 00:17.783
except for the labor and then having

00:17.808 --> 00:20.543
to put all the pieces of the
puzzle back together down there.

00:20.612 --> 00:24.781
Yeah, doesn't matter to
us... a boy, a girl, boy.

00:24.817 --> 00:27.067
All that matters is
that the baby is healthy.

00:27.152 --> 00:29.369
Healthy baby. I mean, a boy
would give us one of each,

00:29.455 --> 00:32.656
and variety is the spice of
life, but no variety... that...

00:32.708 --> 00:34.930
Well, girls like hockey, too.

00:34.955 --> 00:37.160
All right, hoist me up.

00:37.219 --> 00:39.914
I haven't peed in ten
minutes, and I may not make it.

00:39.939 --> 00:42.416
- Oh, there she blows. Okay.
- There you go.

00:43.421 --> 00:46.771
And here are the
pictures of your sonogram.

00:46.796 --> 00:48.138
Oh, you don't want this one.

00:48.215 --> 00:49.965
That's a full-frontal.

00:50.050 --> 00:52.968
It's the first time I haven't
wanted to look at full-frontal.

00:53.536 --> 00:55.270
I am sorry. That, um...

00:55.356 --> 00:57.439
That was very inappropriate.

00:57.524 --> 00:58.784
Well, I'm impressed.

00:58.809 --> 01:01.360
Most dads who already
have girls want to know.

01:01.385 --> 01:02.978
Well, I'm not most dads.

01:03.063 --> 01:05.197
Yup. I'm, uh, pretty evolved, Alissa,

01:05.232 --> 01:07.360
except for that whole
full-frontal joke.

01:07.385 --> 01:09.252
It's very out of character for me,

01:09.277 --> 01:11.450
but you just look like the kind
of girl I could fool around with.

01:11.474 --> 01:13.471
Oh, my gosh, I've made it worse.

01:14.575 --> 01:16.074
Wow!

01:18.000 --> 01:24.074

01:35.706 --> 01:38.513
Just saw myself in the
mirror, so, heads up...

01:38.599 --> 01:40.515
might cry on the way home, or rage.

01:40.601 --> 01:42.184
It's gonna be a game-time decision.

01:42.269 --> 01:43.568
Well, I appreciate the heads up.

01:43.604 --> 01:45.854
Do you have the parking
ticket to get validated?

01:45.879 --> 01:49.189
Yeah, I do. Just got it
right here in... my pocket.

01:55.783 --> 01:57.282
What are you doing?

01:57.334 --> 01:59.501
Oh, uh, n-nothing. I'm just, um...

01:59.586 --> 02:02.015
just... hiding an erection.

02:03.963 --> 02:05.546
Hi, Alissa.

02:07.755 --> 02:10.205
We can never come back here.

02:13.871 --> 02:16.996
Wow. Look who ate all her broccoli.

02:17.021 --> 02:18.186
Well, I didn't look.

02:18.272 --> 02:19.604
- Huh?
- What?

02:19.640 --> 02:21.773
I just said Lark ate all her broccoli.

02:22.269 --> 02:24.455
Oh. Hey!

02:24.480 --> 02:27.605
Well, that is... great.

02:27.630 --> 02:29.698
That is really great.

02:29.783 --> 02:31.400
High five. Yeah!

02:31.485 --> 02:34.773
God! No, no, no, no, no, no!

02:34.798 --> 02:35.868
Oh, damn it!

02:35.893 --> 02:37.681
Yeah. No, you are right to panic.

02:37.706 --> 02:39.837
Nothing gets water out.

02:43.730 --> 02:46.131
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

02:46.657 --> 02:48.157
What do you think you're doing?

02:48.402 --> 02:50.884
Okay, what is going on with you, dude?

02:50.909 --> 02:53.775
Did you get fired?
Because I can handle it.

02:53.800 --> 02:54.867
You just need to tell me.

02:54.892 --> 02:56.305
No, I did not get fired.

02:56.330 --> 02:57.596
Okay, good, because we're
about to have a baby,

02:57.620 --> 02:59.551
and I could not handle that.

02:59.576 --> 03:01.526
So, what is the deal?

03:02.209 --> 03:04.649
I stole the sonogram that
shows the sex of our kid,

03:04.685 --> 03:07.819
and I put it in the pockets of
those jeans like a real jerk.

03:07.855 --> 03:09.821
Greg. You promised.

03:09.857 --> 03:12.107
I know, but I-I did
not look at it, okay?

03:12.192 --> 03:13.966
I swear. It's tearing me apart.

03:13.991 --> 03:16.389
Just get rid of it.
Please just throw it away.

03:16.414 --> 03:19.081
I don't ever want to see it
again, unless you want to look.

03:19.366 --> 03:22.411
Greg, we agreed we want to be surprised.

03:22.436 --> 03:24.503
I mean, right? Plus, I
thought we don't care.

03:24.538 --> 03:26.955
- We don't care.
- No. We just want a healthy baby.

03:27.040 --> 03:29.841
- Healthy baby.
- Okay, so...

03:32.546 --> 03:34.679
Thank you. Thank you.

03:34.715 --> 03:36.214
Wow. You are...

03:36.266 --> 03:37.766
so strong, you know.

03:37.851 --> 03:41.125
I-I hope that's a
quality our son will have.

03:41.578 --> 03:43.044
Or daughter.

03:43.264 --> 03:45.070
Healthy baby.

03:49.935 --> 03:52.147
Hey, Greg.

03:52.545 --> 03:53.817
I changed my mind.

03:53.842 --> 03:55.367
- Let's look.
- Yes!

03:55.402 --> 03:57.369
All right, I'll get it out of the trash.

03:57.404 --> 04:00.288
Honey, I already did. I
taped it back together.

04:00.374 --> 04:02.512
- And also, I want it to be a boy.
- You do?

04:02.537 --> 04:04.187
Yeah, I know you're not
supposed to say stuff like that,

04:04.211 --> 04:05.544
but I can't help it, you know?

04:05.579 --> 04:07.291
I just think you would
raise such an amazing son,

04:07.315 --> 04:09.127
and the world needs good men.

04:09.152 --> 04:11.239
That is so sweet.

04:11.345 --> 04:13.423
Now show me some penis.

04:14.555 --> 04:16.065
Aw, Greg.

04:16.089 --> 04:19.072
Wow. Will you look at that?

04:21.144 --> 04:22.811
You can't tell, either, huh?

04:22.896 --> 04:24.483
Uh, no clue.

04:26.054 --> 04:27.182
It's a boy.

04:27.267 --> 04:29.067
Really? Are you sure?

04:29.102 --> 04:31.091
Yeah, I'm a doctor.
See? There's the dong.

04:31.116 --> 04:33.188
- Yes!
- Yes, it's a boy.

04:33.273 --> 04:34.573
It's a boy. We're having a boy.

04:34.600 --> 04:35.873
Congratulations, man.

04:35.898 --> 04:37.492
Oh, thanks. And, hey, really great

04:37.578 --> 04:38.976
that you're having a girl, you know?

04:39.000 --> 04:40.612
Have fun at ballet.

04:40.664 --> 04:41.863
Dude, you have a daughter.

04:41.949 --> 04:43.448
Yeah, but now I have a son.

04:43.500 --> 04:46.354
I have one of each.
Perfect family, so eat it.

04:46.379 --> 04:48.003
Okay, just so we're clear,

04:48.028 --> 04:49.766
- healthy baby is most important, right?
- Oh.

04:49.790 --> 04:51.840
Healthy boy is just
like icing on the cake.

04:51.925 --> 04:53.208
- Totally.
- Right.

04:55.969 --> 04:57.727
Uh, where is Alissa?

04:57.943 --> 05:00.143
She said you might ask about her.

05:00.348 --> 05:01.827
Do you guys want to know the sex?

05:01.852 --> 05:04.219
Uh, sure. Yeah.

05:04.304 --> 05:05.304
You can tell us.

05:05.355 --> 05:06.721
What the heck? Right, Greg?

05:06.746 --> 05:08.940
Yeah, sure.

05:08.976 --> 05:11.359
You know, I'm actually
glad that it's you,

05:11.445 --> 05:13.144
'cause I couldn't do that to Alissa.

05:13.197 --> 05:15.647
Okay, well, she looks great.

05:16.383 --> 05:17.383
She?

05:17.451 --> 05:19.051
Is this like one of
those boat situations

05:19.119 --> 05:20.952
where just you call it
"she" no matter what?

05:20.988 --> 05:23.884
Yeah, because we had an actual
doctor tell us it was a boy.

05:23.909 --> 05:25.955
Yeah, look, look. We have a picture.

05:25.980 --> 05:27.519
See? There's the peen.

05:27.544 --> 05:30.545
What? Oh, what is this?
Did you get this wet?

05:30.631 --> 05:34.416
Uh, no, but water doesn't stain.

05:34.441 --> 05:37.116
Uh, it's a girl. Do you
want another picture?

05:37.141 --> 05:38.937
No, no. We get the gist. Thanks.

05:38.962 --> 05:40.680
All right. Well, guys,
congratulations again.

05:40.704 --> 05:42.390
I got to run to my son's hockey game.

05:42.476 --> 05:45.810
Can't miss that. He's my best friend.

05:49.850 --> 05:53.518
Well, all that matters
is that she's healthy.

05:54.358 --> 05:57.393
Healthy baby girl.

06:00.051 --> 06:02.452
Could've sworn that was peen.

06:03.376 --> 06:05.079
_

06:07.200 --> 06:09.668
Been really worried
since Dad almost died,

06:09.703 --> 06:12.954
and I'm not sure what he'll
be around for, and what...

06:13.040 --> 06:15.296
Oh, cool, a froggy! Yeah.

06:15.321 --> 06:16.853
We had to dodge traffic to pick him up

06:16.877 --> 06:18.305
before a car could smush him.

06:18.330 --> 06:20.564
Yeah, I ran into the street
thinking that he was a dollar.

06:20.588 --> 06:23.187
That's so sweet. This frog needed help,

06:23.212 --> 06:25.300
and you're giving it the
love and care it needs.

06:25.385 --> 06:27.040
I'll keep him in the toilet.

06:27.160 --> 06:29.971
No! We have to put him somewhere
that feels like its home.

06:30.057 --> 06:32.307
Or we can just take turns holding him.

06:32.673 --> 06:34.423
Or her.

06:37.593 --> 06:39.021
There are no answers here.

06:39.046 --> 06:40.532
Uh-uh.

06:40.567 --> 06:42.450
Aw.

06:44.121 --> 06:46.621
I knew my fish died for a reason.

06:46.707 --> 06:48.990
Yeah, because you forgot to feed it.

06:49.076 --> 06:51.706
Well, I won't make that
mistake a third time.

06:51.731 --> 06:55.664
Okay, well, it looks like
he's a yellow-brown coqui.

06:55.689 --> 06:57.749
- Aw.
- He's so sweet.

06:57.801 --> 06:59.250
I feel like he's my baby.

06:59.303 --> 07:01.419
This must be what it's
like to be a mother.

07:01.471 --> 07:02.865
- Mm-hmm. 
- Okay, we have to kill it.

07:02.889 --> 07:04.472
- What?
- 'Scuse me?

07:04.558 --> 07:06.536
It says right here on the
Fish and Wildlife website.

07:06.560 --> 07:07.926
"The yellow-brown coqui

07:07.978 --> 07:10.405
is an invasive species
capable of destroying

07:10.430 --> 07:11.761
the California ecosystem.

07:11.786 --> 07:14.316
If you come into contact
with one, exterminate it."

07:14.401 --> 07:15.650
- What?
- What?

07:15.736 --> 07:17.485
We have to kill Michael?

07:17.571 --> 07:20.939
You named the frog after we
found out we had to kill it?

07:20.991 --> 07:22.926
Whoa, whoa, whoa. We
are not killing Michael.

07:23.020 --> 07:24.386
- Yeah.
- We'll just keep him as a pet.

07:24.410 --> 07:25.493
Nobody has to know.

07:25.579 --> 07:27.539
No. It says that it's
illegal to keep him as a pet

07:27.581 --> 07:28.745
because he might escape.

07:28.770 --> 07:30.697
That's crazy. How can he escape?

07:30.722 --> 07:32.751
He's just a...

07:33.192 --> 07:34.953
Where did he go?

07:35.239 --> 07:38.372
Guys, nobody move.

07:39.292 --> 07:41.457
This would be such a cute picture.

07:41.482 --> 07:42.627
What?

07:42.739 --> 07:43.772
Ready?

07:43.797 --> 07:45.096
One, two, three.

07:45.132 --> 07:47.207
Where's Michael?

07:51.964 --> 07:53.714
What you doing?

07:53.739 --> 07:55.190
I'm looking for Michael.

07:55.275 --> 07:58.362
Oh, honey, I told you.
Michael was allergic to bees.

07:58.387 --> 08:00.554
He's not coming back.

08:03.376 --> 08:04.649
He's not in the car.

08:04.701 --> 08:07.035
Car? Sam, I feel like
you're not even looking.

08:07.120 --> 08:08.486
Because I don't want to kill him.

08:08.538 --> 08:10.155
I got him!

08:10.207 --> 08:12.814
He was halfway down
the garbage disposal.

08:12.839 --> 08:15.084
He could've died, you guys.

08:15.109 --> 08:17.192
Then why did you save him?

08:17.468 --> 08:19.631
Because I forgot what we were doing.

08:19.790 --> 08:21.256
None of us want to kill him,

08:21.281 --> 08:23.585
but it's either him or the environment.

08:23.670 --> 08:26.790
So the question is: which
one of us is gonna do it?

08:29.790 --> 08:31.447
Yeah, we're not doing that.

08:31.472 --> 08:34.261
Yeah, it's your pet; it's
your responsibility to kill it.

08:34.618 --> 08:37.972
Just call animal control.
They'll take care of it.

08:38.018 --> 08:39.567
We did. They said they were too busy

08:39.653 --> 08:41.236
to come take care of one frog.

08:41.321 --> 08:44.239
The guy was screaming about
some sort of zoo escape.

08:44.324 --> 08:46.741
Yeah, I told you I saw a jaguar, Joanie.

08:46.766 --> 08:49.668
I think frogs die if
you take off their legs.

08:50.212 --> 08:51.494
I don't envy you kids.

08:51.519 --> 08:53.331
You know, I had to
kill a baby possum once.

08:53.366 --> 08:55.228
Yeah. Drowned it in a bucket.

08:55.253 --> 08:58.364
Oh, dear! Why would you do that?

08:58.389 --> 08:59.639
I had to.

08:59.664 --> 09:00.830
Was it injured?

09:00.855 --> 09:02.605
No, no, but it was a possum.

09:04.306 --> 09:05.960
Guys, I had to.

09:06.507 --> 09:08.173
You had to?

09:08.900 --> 09:11.344
Yes.

09:11.369 --> 09:13.601
Well, I guess we'll
do it ourselves, then.

09:13.626 --> 09:15.553
Hi! Hey, you want to go
play with your cousins?

09:15.605 --> 09:16.888
What are you guys up to?

09:16.940 --> 09:19.732
We're gonna kill this cute
little froggy right now.

09:19.757 --> 09:21.860
- You want to come?
- You know what?

09:21.895 --> 09:24.529
How 'bout, uh, we have a
little extra screen time today?

09:24.564 --> 09:26.179
Huh?

09:29.258 --> 09:30.394
Okay.

09:30.419 --> 09:32.881
W... Are we sure this is a good idea?

09:32.906 --> 09:35.490
Yes. We all drop our
bricks at the same time.

09:35.575 --> 09:37.575
That way, nobody knows
who's killing the frog.

09:37.627 --> 09:40.048
It's like a firing squad.

09:40.134 --> 09:42.330
Especially for you, Tyler.

09:42.813 --> 09:44.791
Oh, come on!

09:46.962 --> 09:49.921
Okay, so nobody knows who
has the frog bag, right?

09:49.973 --> 09:53.892
Nope. But I know who doesn't
have it: me, Sam and Clem.

09:53.927 --> 09:55.810
Sophia!

09:57.384 --> 10:00.051
Okay, so now nobody knows, right?

10:00.472 --> 10:01.786
Okay.

10:01.811 --> 10:02.811
Three...

10:03.603 --> 10:04.603
...two...

10:05.161 --> 10:06.702
No, wait.

10:06.727 --> 10:07.798
Can we just

10:07.823 --> 10:10.408
say something nice about Michael first?

10:10.443 --> 10:12.694
It's not his fault he's invasive.

10:12.779 --> 10:15.947
He's laying his life
down to help the Earth.

10:15.999 --> 10:18.082
So, thank you, Michael.

10:18.118 --> 10:19.667
That was so sweet.

10:19.753 --> 10:20.939
Yeah.

10:20.964 --> 10:23.454
Oh, make sure you throw
your bricks down really hard.

10:23.507 --> 10:25.206
You got to smash the brain.

10:25.292 --> 10:27.208
Good note.

10:27.282 --> 10:29.544
- Mm-hmm. 
- Here we go.

10:29.629 --> 10:30.929
Three,

10:31.154 --> 10:32.570
two,

10:32.595 --> 10:33.678
one.

10:38.787 --> 10:40.471
At least it's over.

10:41.256 --> 10:43.972
Yeah. Yeah, but I'm really proud of us.

10:44.261 --> 10:46.088
Okay. Full disclosure:

10:46.113 --> 10:48.041
I lost the frog when I
was changing the bags.

10:48.066 --> 10:49.230
- What?
- What?

10:49.611 --> 10:51.861
Do you think he's
gonna be okay out there?

10:51.886 --> 10:55.026
Yes! That's the problem!
He's going to thrive!

10:59.057 --> 11:00.948
_

11:00.973 --> 11:02.804
And to think that, in the first round,

11:02.828 --> 11:04.876
this team was on the
verge of elimination,

11:04.901 --> 11:07.714
and now in the finals, they are
seconds away from a historic...

11:07.800 --> 11:10.551
You know, my heart attack made
me realize just how lucky I am

11:10.636 --> 11:12.565
- to have you.
- Mm-hmm. Yeah.

11:12.590 --> 11:14.040
You keep telling me that.

11:14.065 --> 11:15.264
I could never rub you enough.

11:15.289 --> 11:17.268
No, you could. You
could, Tim. You-you have.

11:17.293 --> 11:19.485
Down low to Morehead in the post.

11:19.510 --> 11:22.229
He goes up with it, and the shot is...

11:22.817 --> 11:24.431
Hey! Whoa!

11:24.456 --> 11:26.256
Beloved family, a toast.

11:27.928 --> 11:29.246
Yes, time is fleeting.

11:29.271 --> 11:30.088
- Yes!
- Oh!

11:30.113 --> 11:32.148
There's ten seconds
left on the clock, Tim.

11:32.217 --> 11:34.484
And that's what it felt like
for me with my own clock.

11:34.519 --> 11:35.783
Oh, my God.

11:35.808 --> 11:37.998
You know, when I look at my children

11:38.023 --> 11:39.355
and I stare into your eyes,

11:39.424 --> 11:42.556
it's like I see my own
seed staring back at me.

11:42.581 --> 11:44.828
Oh, gross, Dad.

11:44.863 --> 11:46.446
Especially you, Tyler.

11:46.531 --> 11:47.614
Please, not another kiss.

11:47.699 --> 11:48.953
Mwah!

11:48.978 --> 11:50.283
On the lips.

11:50.368 --> 11:53.420
How could I forget the rest
of my support system, my rocks?

11:53.505 --> 11:55.453
Make out with him so we
can get back to the game.

11:55.478 --> 11:56.623
Make out with him.

11:56.648 --> 11:59.426
And, of course, my own
personal hero, John.

11:59.511 --> 12:02.262
I wouldn't be here without
you saving my life. Come to me.

12:02.347 --> 12:04.711
No. No. Anybody needs me,

12:04.736 --> 12:08.134
I'll be in the garage working
on my Adirondack chair.

12:08.220 --> 12:12.138
Ah! A throne for my king!

12:12.224 --> 12:14.402
This is one of those games where

12:14.427 --> 12:16.239
you'll remember where you
were when you watched it.

12:16.263 --> 12:18.393
Oh, come on!

12:18.418 --> 12:19.750
This incredible family.

12:19.775 --> 12:21.659
The adventure continues.

12:25.237 --> 12:26.870
- Oh! Heather!
- Oh!

12:26.905 --> 12:28.288
What are you doing?

12:28.373 --> 12:29.622
I'm hiding from Tim.

12:29.708 --> 12:31.958
I just want five minutes
without him rubbing my back.

12:32.043 --> 12:34.961
Oh, honey. You know, it's common,

12:35.046 --> 12:36.963
after a near-death experience,

12:37.048 --> 12:38.965
to be more affectionate to loved ones.

12:39.050 --> 12:41.915
But in this case, it's
just plain annoying.

12:41.940 --> 12:44.572
God, if he tells me one more time

12:44.597 --> 12:45.929
to dance like no one's watching,

12:45.965 --> 12:49.357
I'm gonna kill him and
ask everyone to watch.

12:49.382 --> 12:51.465
- Heather!
- Oh, damn it.

12:51.555 --> 12:52.910
Heather!

12:53.379 --> 12:55.214
Ah, there you are.

12:55.239 --> 12:57.167
- Hi.
- Oh. You almost lost me once.

12:57.192 --> 12:58.526
- I don't want you to lose me again.
- Yeah.

12:58.550 --> 13:00.771
No, no, no. Me neither.

13:00.796 --> 13:02.847
We're out of tea!

13:04.096 --> 13:05.775
Could you get me some tea?

13:05.800 --> 13:07.110
From your house?

13:07.135 --> 13:08.652
For you, anything, Joan.

13:08.704 --> 13:09.904
No, it's just a small request,

13:09.955 --> 13:11.350
so you don't need to kiss me on the...

13:11.374 --> 13:12.570
- Mwah!
- Oh.

13:12.595 --> 13:14.518
- Well, you got what you wanted.
- Oh.

13:14.543 --> 13:17.411
Now I'm gonna go get you what
you want. 'Cause I love you.

13:17.496 --> 13:20.547
- And I love you.
- I-I... Yeah, yeah.

13:20.633 --> 13:23.417
Oh, you poor thing. Just leave him.

13:23.817 --> 13:26.485
Joanie, get out here. I
need another pair of hands.

13:26.510 --> 13:28.877
Mm, the damn chair.

13:29.385 --> 13:30.634
Heather...

13:30.715 --> 13:32.140
send Tim.

13:32.344 --> 13:34.631
If anybody can crush his sunny mood,

13:34.656 --> 13:36.709
it's John cursing out a piece of plywood

13:36.734 --> 13:39.099
and bitching about the price of gas.

13:39.507 --> 13:42.357
$4.15 for regular?

13:42.382 --> 13:44.354
When I was a boy, it was just a quarter.

13:44.407 --> 13:46.273
What a life.

13:46.358 --> 13:48.822
Ken Burns could do eight parts on you.

13:48.847 --> 13:50.077
Where'd Joanie go?

13:50.196 --> 13:51.745
Oh, she asked me to take over,

13:51.831 --> 13:54.289
and I cherish the opportunity
to create with you.

13:54.610 --> 13:55.967
It's just a chair.

13:55.992 --> 13:59.499
Well, you lend a man a
chair, he sits but a day.

13:59.524 --> 14:03.090
But you build a man a chair,
he sits for a lifetime.

14:03.175 --> 14:05.459
Uh-huh, like you on
the can at Thanksgiving?

14:05.544 --> 14:07.827
That's beautiful, John.

14:07.852 --> 14:09.827
You know, ever since my episode...

14:09.852 --> 14:12.350
Don't call it your episode.

14:12.379 --> 14:13.411
I'm sorry. You're right.

14:13.436 --> 14:15.052
You were just as scared as I was.

14:15.104 --> 14:16.970
Ever since our episode...

14:17.056 --> 14:19.438
So you could have died; who cares?

14:19.463 --> 14:21.727
Why don't you put on your big-boy pants

14:21.752 --> 14:24.321
and quit French-kissing your kids, huh?

14:24.346 --> 14:25.696
Now hold this.

14:25.731 --> 14:27.147
All right, I'll hold it.

14:27.233 --> 14:28.593
But I'm gonna pretend I'm holding you.

14:28.617 --> 14:29.755
May I hold you?

14:29.780 --> 14:30.862
No!

14:31.229 --> 14:33.312
You know...

14:35.434 --> 14:37.184
This time with you is the most...

14:39.295 --> 14:41.161
precious gift that...

14:42.580 --> 14:44.099
a son-in...

14:45.591 --> 14:47.000
law could ever have!

14:48.263 --> 14:50.170
Why didn't I let you just die?

14:50.256 --> 14:51.221
Here, you take over.

14:51.257 --> 14:52.556
I need a drink.

14:52.591 --> 14:54.892
- Ah, may your cup runneth over.
- Mm.

14:54.927 --> 14:57.757
Got to if I'm gonna deal with you.

15:16.582 --> 15:19.953
I made you, Matt. And you made me.

15:19.978 --> 15:22.703
Damn it. It's blurry.
Dad, can you go again?

15:22.788 --> 15:24.004
Mom?!

15:24.756 --> 15:27.645
Thanks to Tim for his
words of wisdom and...

15:27.670 --> 15:31.699
and the loose bolt that, uh,
came off my Cuban circular saw.

15:31.724 --> 15:33.931
I feel so lucky to have you all.

15:33.966 --> 15:35.549
I can still post this.

15:35.841 --> 15:37.977
Oh, no. No, no, no, no. No, no. Okay.

15:38.002 --> 15:39.603
My firstborn.

15:39.638 --> 15:41.638
- The mold.
- Mm, thank you, Dad.

15:41.690 --> 15:43.724
No one's ever called me "mold" before.

15:43.809 --> 15:45.058
Mm.

15:45.144 --> 15:47.773
- For both of us. Our North Star.
- Oh.

15:47.798 --> 15:48.862
Hi, Mom.

15:48.948 --> 15:50.864
Look. This is so much better.

15:51.332 --> 15:52.531
Thank you.

15:55.708 --> 15:57.560
_

15:58.541 --> 15:59.522
Ever since Morgan

15:59.542 --> 16:00.825
went to visit her family,

16:00.877 --> 16:02.560
she hasn't returned any of our calls,

16:02.585 --> 16:03.939
and we're worried that's kind of weird.

16:03.963 --> 16:05.641
Or is that fine? 'Cause
we're totally fine.

16:05.665 --> 16:07.810
I'm gonna have one of these, if
that's okay. Thank you so much.

16:07.834 --> 16:11.635
We're concerned, but we're totally calm.

16:13.306 --> 16:14.725
Can't you just eat
that in one bite, Matt?

16:14.749 --> 16:15.881
I like to savor them, Colleen.

16:15.905 --> 16:18.474
Yeah, it's okay to be stressed.

16:18.499 --> 16:21.191
Well, if I was stressed, I'd
be laughing uncomfortably.

16:22.147 --> 16:25.060
This is totally common. You
know, a lot of birth mothers

16:25.085 --> 16:27.318
have these moments where
they go radio silent,

16:27.353 --> 16:29.236
you know, maybe even have a few doubts.

16:29.741 --> 16:31.439
But then they come around.

16:32.969 --> 16:35.359
Either that, or she's dead
in a ditch somewhere, right?

16:38.527 --> 16:39.511
You know what?

16:39.536 --> 16:42.135
Uh, let me try and get
in touch with Morgan.

16:42.160 --> 16:43.701
Just sit tight.

16:43.753 --> 16:45.167
Sit tight.

16:45.755 --> 16:48.873
I'm actually really proud of
how calm we're being, you know?

16:48.875 --> 16:50.291
There are no red ones in here.

16:50.327 --> 16:51.521
Why are there no red ones in here?

16:51.545 --> 16:53.239
Excuse me! There are
no red ones in here!

16:53.264 --> 16:55.744
Why don't you just eat an orange
one and a yellow one together?

17:00.353 --> 17:01.635
Oh.

17:01.721 --> 17:03.104
Hi there.

17:03.189 --> 17:04.605
- Hi.
- Hi.

17:04.690 --> 17:06.891
Did you eat all the red ones?

17:07.556 --> 17:09.109
I wish, dude.

17:17.874 --> 17:19.153
Don't tell.

17:19.238 --> 17:20.988
I didn't see anything.

17:21.757 --> 17:23.531
Lucas, out.

17:24.075 --> 17:25.190
Go play.

17:28.718 --> 17:30.364
I'm really sorry.

17:30.389 --> 17:34.028
- Oh, no. He's so sweet.
- Oh, no, he's such a sweet dude.

17:34.053 --> 17:35.085
No.

17:37.423 --> 17:39.306
I'm sorry.

17:46.781 --> 17:48.414
No.

17:49.469 --> 17:51.834
- No.
- You might...

17:51.859 --> 17:53.400
- No!
- Just...

17:53.425 --> 17:56.023
We don't want the tissues, Sherri!

17:56.890 --> 17:58.409
What did Morgan say?

17:58.444 --> 18:01.195
She decided to keep the baby.

18:01.499 --> 18:03.781
See, sorry, I'm sorry, it's
just that you told us that...

18:03.833 --> 18:06.404
there was nothing to worry about
and that this was common, so...

18:06.429 --> 18:07.950
I know. I'm sorry.

18:07.975 --> 18:09.597
Adoption takes time.

18:09.622 --> 18:11.773
There-there are gonna
be some steps backwards.

18:11.798 --> 18:14.299
But it's all been backward steps.

18:14.324 --> 18:17.378
How long does it take to get
a baby? It's been nine months!

18:17.463 --> 18:19.263
It will work out.

18:19.298 --> 18:22.933
Why would you say that? You don't know.

18:24.136 --> 18:25.936
Do you know?

18:31.752 --> 18:33.027
I'm very sorry.

18:47.668 --> 18:49.585
- I'm so sorry.
- I know.

18:49.670 --> 18:52.888
Why are you crying? Did you fall down?

18:52.974 --> 18:55.404
No, I'm just a little sad.

18:55.429 --> 18:58.677
Do you have to take a bath tonight, too?

18:58.729 --> 19:00.762
No.

19:00.787 --> 19:03.037
We were just trying
to adopt a little baby,

19:03.062 --> 19:04.683
and I don't think it's gonna work out.

19:04.735 --> 19:06.402
We're okay, though. Thank you.

19:06.487 --> 19:09.554
Here. This will make you feel better.

19:09.843 --> 19:11.657
Okay. Thank you.

19:11.692 --> 19:13.575
Oh.

19:14.538 --> 19:16.278
It took me five years,

19:16.364 --> 19:20.146
but I'm meeting my new family tomorrow.

19:20.171 --> 19:22.918
You'll find your family soon.

19:23.004 --> 19:24.420
Okay.

19:26.207 --> 19:29.124
Are you guys okay?

19:29.202 --> 19:32.087
You know, I think... I think we will be.

19:32.120 --> 19:33.206
- Yeah.
- Okay.

19:33.231 --> 19:35.449
I mean, if Lucas can wait
five years to get adopted,

19:35.474 --> 19:37.278
- then we can hang in there, right?
- Yeah?

19:37.303 --> 19:40.087
Oh. No, Lucas isn't getting adopted.

19:40.583 --> 19:43.270
Wait, he said he was meeting
his new family tomorrow.

19:43.295 --> 19:46.138
Oh, no. No, he's being
placed in a foster home.

19:46.163 --> 19:48.818
You know, sometimes the
children get a bit confused.

19:48.843 --> 19:50.045
- Oh, no.
- Oh.

19:50.070 --> 19:51.007
Yeah.

19:51.032 --> 19:52.594
Well, when you're ready,

19:52.619 --> 19:55.485
come on in and we'll start your
search for a new birth mother.

20:06.571 --> 20:08.087
Is this crazy?
