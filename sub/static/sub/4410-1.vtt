- Interesting concept, selling

Wonderfully American.

20:38.500 --> 20:40.415
- Here. The big one, New York.
- New York?

20:40.541 --> 20:42.207
Don't get excited. We didn't get in.

We're not good enough.

20:56.041 --> 20:57.665
That's a little harsh, isn't it?

We are good enough. He just
doesn't care about winning.

Yes, it is.

57:48.208 --> 57:50.499
Why so glum?

57:50.625 --> 57:53.874
Don't worry.
You'll get the hang of the road.

57:54.000 --> 57:58.207
1,000, 2,000-seat halls,
all those people.

57:59.208 --> 58:01.707
It doesn't matter.
You don't even see 'em.

58:01.833 --> 58:04.624
Just keep up on the music:
me up front, you supporting.

58:05.625 --> 58:07.499
We'll dominate.

59:01.625 --> 59:02.999
I didn't know you were here.

59:03.125 --> 59:06.082
You wanted to see me.

59:13.416 --> 59:17.999
Rachmaninoff was 20
when he composed that.

59:20.000 --> 59:23.665
20. Just a few years older than you.

59:23.791 --> 59:26.415
I never knew you could play that well.

59:27.625 --> 59:29.749
Well, I learned it when I was 13.

59:29.875 --> 59:31.832
I played it better then than now.

59:37.625 --> 59:39.874
I'm changing the lineup.

59:40.000 --> 59:43.624
Andre's having trouble,
so you're gonna take his place.

59:44.625 --> 59:47.624
You're gonna be in the first
row, third from the right.

59:50.416 --> 59:52.874
I can tell you're nervous already.

59:53.000 --> 59:55.499
The truth is, I'm not a religious man,

59:55.625 --> 59:58.707
but this is about as sacred
as you can get, Stet.

59:58.833 --> 01:00:03.082
This is a community of people
feeling the same thing.

01:00:03.208 --> 01:00:05.499
Most of them strangers,

01:00:06.225 --> 01:00:09.399
but you are uniting them.

(CHOIR SINGING)

01:00:10.625 --> 01:00:13.290
You are giving them your voice.

01:00:13.416 --> 01:00:15.749
And that's as spiritual as it gets.

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:18.874
Completely flat. I want you leveled.

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:20.999

Honey, what do you know
about the National Boychoir?

01:01:39.833 --> 01:01:41.499
The what? Wait, what?

01:01:41.625 --> 01:01:43.499
We got four tickets in the mail.

01:01:43.625 --> 01:01:45.082
Tickets to what?

01:01:45.208 --> 01:01:47.499
To a concert of theirs.
Tomorrow, up in New Haven.

01:01:47.625 --> 01:01:50.082
- Who sent them?
- I don't know. There's no note.

01:01:50.208 --> 01:01:53.082
Uh... ignore it. It's probably
just some promotional thing.

01:01:53.208 --> 01:01:55.207
Well, why can't we use them?

01:01:55.333 --> 01:01:57.082
It's Yale, it's Woolsey Hall.

01:01:57.208 --> 01:01:59.999
I haven't been back to campus
since my reunion. And besides,

01:02:00.125 --> 01:02:02.707
when's the last time
we did anything as a family?

01:02:02.833 --> 01:02:05.540
- Babe, the girls don't like classical music.
- I like choirs.

01:02:05.666 --> 01:02:07.874
Sally, we don't even know who sent them.

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:09.374
Who cares?

01:02:09.500 --> 01:02:12.707
I think it'd be fun. Don't you, guys?

01:02:12.833 --> 01:02:15.165
- Yeah.
- We'll get all dressed up.

Chest cold. Slight fever.
Nothing severe.

In three or four days,
he should be fine.

01:02:40.625 --> 01:02:42.249
Doctor, is there anything you can do

01:02:42.375 --> 01:02:44.082
to make him sing? The concert's today.

01:02:44.208 --> 01:02:47.290

- Why?

Better to cancel than get it wrong.

01:02:53.416 --> 01:02:56.415

We have someone that can step in.

but the concert is at 3.

- Five minutes.
- You're ready?

- Mr. Carvelle, I can't do this.
- It's too late for that.

01:04:38.416 --> 01:04:41.290
- I hate Handel.
- Handel hated singers, too.

- No, you'll be okay.

You know the music.

just follow the maestro's eyes.

working toward.

- What's on the program?

Messiah!

01:10:15.208 --> 01:10:17.874
Something like that would top
the Vienna Boys' Choir.

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:20.457
- Time to tell the world who's first.
- It doesn't have a solo part.

also at Eastertide.

what does it matter?

Messiah is one hell of a crowd-pleaser.

01:10:30.833 --> 01:10:32.374
At Riverside, it will be huge.

01:10:32.500 --> 01:10:34.082

01:10:34.208 --> 01:10:36.999
We write a descant.
We write a new solo part.

01:10:37.125 --> 01:10:39.707
They were all doing it
back in those days.

01:10:39.833 --> 01:10:42.124
Keep it in the same key
and hit a high D.

01:10:42.250 --> 01:10:43.374
- I've already started...
- I'll do it.

01:10:43.500 --> 01:10:45.207
- What if you need any help?
- I'll write it.

01:10:45.333 --> 01:10:47.374
But can anyone of them
even reach a high D?

01:10:49.416 --> 01:10:52.874
- It's either Devon or Stet.
- It'll have to be Devon.

01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:53.957
Stet's leaving.

01:10:54.083 --> 01:10:57.874
His dad's sending him to a
boarding school in Switzerland.

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:00.290
What?

01:11:00.416 --> 01:11:02.457
It's about a nine-hour flight, Stet,

01:11:02.583 --> 01:11:05.290
but I was able to get you a window.

01:11:05.416 --> 01:11:08.415
I do suggest you try and get some sleep.

01:11:09.833 --> 01:11:12.999
I know this is a change,
but it is for the best.

01:11:15.416 --> 01:11:17.832
Stay where you are, Stet.

01:11:21.208 --> 01:11:23.707
- Let's go, now.
- Didn't you hear me?

01:11:23.833 --> 01:11:25.415
What?

01:11:26.625 --> 01:11:29.332
He's not going with you.

01:11:29.458 --> 01:11:32.040
- He's my son.
- Yes, I know.

01:11:32.166 --> 01:11:34.207
Your secret son.

01:11:35.750 --> 01:11:39.082
It was you, wasn't it?
You're the one that sent those tickets.

Yes, we send tickets to all the parents,

an actual interest

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:45.915
in their child's well-being.

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:51.999
This is very simple, Mr. Owens.

01:11:52.625 --> 01:11:54.999
I continue your son's instruction...

01:11:56.625 --> 01:11:58.415
and your secret...

01:11:59.208 --> 01:12:01.207
remains just that.

01:12:15.125 --> 01:12:18.207
Okay, now, take one,
pass it around to your friends.

01:12:19.208 --> 01:12:22.207
Don't be deceived
by how simple this looks.

01:12:24.416 --> 01:12:26.290
Because this thing, in fact,

01:12:26.416 --> 01:12:28.832
is the biggest challenge
you've ever had.

01:12:30.833 --> 01:12:32.624
Alright. Don't look so scared.

01:12:34.833 --> 01:12:36.582
What is this?

He's a crowd-pleaser, and that
means you've got to sing out...

for some stupid committee

- to kick me out.
- Where you're gonna run?

I was a few years older
than you. I had a chance.

01:18:48.208 --> 01:18:49.207
I was at Juilliard,

01:18:49.333 --> 01:18:51.665
and I wanted a piano
more than anything else,

01:18:51.791 --> 01:18:54.290
and the teacher I wanted
to impress flunked me

01:18:54.416 --> 01:18:57.290
straight out, told me,
and this is a quote...

01:18:57.416 --> 01:18:59.415
He said I lacked the talent.

01:19:00.416 --> 01:19:04.332
- And that was it. I was gone.
- You just left?

01:19:04.458 --> 01:19:07.207
I hit him first. Then, I left.

01:19:10.625 --> 01:19:13.207

Stet, you have a right
to address the committee.

01:20:24.416 --> 01:20:25.957

I won't do it again. I wanna stay.

Mr. Carvelle, I didn't mean.

no fighting in the school.

we all run out of chances.

Okay. Reluctantly, I have to
recommend immediate expulsion.

As much as it hurts the choir,

to be made an example of.

01:21:30.166 --> 01:21:32.415
What the bloody hell's this
got to do with Devon?

01:21:32.541 --> 01:21:33.874
I spoke to Devon this morning.

01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:35.499
He admitted stealing
Stet's personal file

01:21:35.625 --> 01:21:37.957
and circulating his mother's
arrest photo.

01:21:38.083 --> 01:21:40.082
Those were acts of cruelty.

01:21:40.208 --> 01:21:43.207
We're better off without...
both of them.

01:21:44.583 --> 01:21:45.915
Carvelle, there really is no comparison

01:21:46.041 --> 01:21:48.082
with Stet's own behaviour.
I mean, need I refresh

01:21:48.208 --> 01:21:49.332
your memory by enumerating examples

01:21:49.458 --> 01:21:50.999
of his reckless and antisocial
behaviour?

Drake! Drake! Quiet!

01:21:53.833 --> 01:21:55.499
We all think we know these boys,

01:21:55.625 --> 01:21:57.499
what goes on with them, but we don't.

01:21:57.625 --> 01:21:59.290
We don't know a damn thing.

01:21:59.416 --> 01:22:01.957
We have forgotten
what it was like to be them.

01:22:03.833 --> 01:22:06.874
In addition, I'd like to say
that out of personal ambition,

01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:10.165
I encouraged the rivalry
between Stet and Devon.

01:22:10.291 --> 01:22:11.290
(SIGHING)

01:22:11.416 --> 01:22:13.457
Therefore, Justine,
I intend to step back

01:22:13.583 --> 01:22:15.082
from leading the boychoir

01:22:15.208 --> 01:22:18.999
and take some time off, starting today.

01:22:19.125 --> 01:22:21.165
- What?
- Is this some kind of stunt?

01:22:21.291 --> 01:22:24.957
- Are you serious?
- Never more so.

01:22:25.083 --> 01:22:27.290
Wonderful. Smashing.
Can I help you with your bags?

01:22:27.416 --> 01:22:29.665
No, he doesn't need
any help with his bags.

01:22:29.791 --> 01:22:32.499
- Carvelle, you can't leave.

01:22:45.833 --> 01:22:48.290
and we lose Stet and Devon and Carvelle.

01:22:48.416 --> 01:22:50.290
I don't know, we're gonna fall
on our asses

01:22:50.416 --> 01:22:52.415

01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:57.582
Okay, Stet and Devon
will remain at the school.

01:22:57.708 --> 01:22:59.624
They can have Saturday detention

01:22:59.750 --> 01:23:01.332

01:23:01.458 --> 01:23:02.874
I don't care.

01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:04.957
But I'm not gonna let you
piss on this opportunity.

01:23:05.083 --> 01:23:07.624
Would you do me the courtesy
of looking at me

01:23:07.750 --> 01:23:09.082

knock it out of the ballpark.

descending from heaven

01:23:19.708 --> 01:23:23.082

I want people to weep.

01:23:23.208 --> 01:23:25.290
I want you and your boys

01:23:25.416 --> 01:23:27.624
to shatter the stained glass windows!

You just keep going now. You understand?

01:24:48.625 --> 01:24:50.749
Yes, ma'am.

01:24:57.000 --> 01:24:59.499
You've left the spot
for lead treble blank.

01:25:01.166 --> 01:25:02.832
Yeah, tell me.

Stet and Devon have both hit the high D,

but we can't afford to experiment.

01:25:09.208 --> 01:25:10.707
Not here, not today.

01:25:10.833 --> 01:25:14.082
Stet is instinctive.
Devon is analytical.

01:25:14.208 --> 01:25:16.207
He doesn't make mistakes.

01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:18.999
You know it, I know it.

01:25:24.625 --> 01:25:27.874
I know that you... you know this,

two and a half years.

01:25:39.666 --> 01:25:41.957
the mystery of your gift...

01:25:42.083 --> 01:25:45.415
wake up one morning,
and it just isn't there anymore.

01:25:46.416 --> 01:25:47.874
Some of you become altos,

some of you become baritones,

other gifts in your lifetime.

is when those gifts appear,

01:26:04.625 --> 01:26:07.999
nurture them the way
you've nurtured this one.

and feel where you are.

01:26:25.041 --> 01:26:26.999
This isn't about Handel.

01:26:28.416 --> 01:26:30.332
This is about music.

01:26:30.458 --> 01:26:32.415
It's about you.

01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:38.624
It's 50 minutes of your life.

01:30:31.625 --> 01:30:33.624

01:30:57.416 --> 01:30:59.790
Congratulations.

01:30:59.916 --> 01:31:02.124
Your voice is changing.

01:31:02.250 --> 01:31:03.999
You're growing up.

01:31:06.416 --> 01:31:07.999
You okay?

01:31:12.625 --> 01:31:15.332
I knew my voice would change,

01:31:15.458 --> 01:31:18.707
but I thought I had more time.

01:31:18.833 --> 01:31:20.165
Happens to all of us.

01:31:20.291 --> 01:31:23.624
I mean, you don't want to be
a kid forever, do you?

01:31:27.625 --> 01:31:28.832
Well...

01:31:29.833 --> 01:31:31.290
What are the chances

01:31:31.416 --> 01:31:34.499
of a good treble becoming a good alto?

01:31:37.416 --> 01:31:39.415
You'll never sing like you did.

01:31:41.416 --> 01:31:44.415
That voice, that sound...

01:31:48.208 --> 01:31:50.290
it wasn't really yours to keep.

01:31:50.416 --> 01:31:52.707
You borrowed it for a little while

01:31:52.833 --> 01:31:55.374
and then it went somewhere else.

01:31:56.625 --> 01:31:59.290
Then what's the point of all
the lessons and the work

01:31:59.416 --> 01:32:02.124
that I did if... if I'm just
gonna lose my voice?

01:32:03.625 --> 01:32:05.624
The lessons are the point.

01:32:10.625 --> 01:32:12.624
Wonder what will happen to him.

01:32:15.833 --> 01:32:19.290
A letter of recommendation
from you could open many doors.

01:32:19.416 --> 01:32:21.207

I don't write recommendations, Drake.

It's a life we give them here,

01:32:38.291 --> 01:32:39.999
not a career.

That's great.

01:32:58.916 --> 01:33:02.499
- So, you're leaving us?
- Yes, ma'am.

01:33:02.625 --> 01:33:04.207
You don't have to, you know.

01:33:04.333 --> 01:33:06.290
We're not kicking you to the curb.

01:33:06.416 --> 01:33:08.290
You could stay as an alto.

01:33:08.416 --> 01:33:11.707
Wish I could, but I'm being
sent to another school.

01:33:11.833 --> 01:33:13.832
Oh... Okay, then.

01:33:16.416 --> 01:33:18.415

- Yup.

- Is someone coming for you?
- No.

It's overseas.

It's okay, Mr. Wooly, I'll be fine.

01:34:22.833 --> 01:34:23.999
I know.

01:34:25.625 --> 01:34:27.707
Well, alright then.
