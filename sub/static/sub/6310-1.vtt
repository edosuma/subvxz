The Budapest Project
is a joint task force

00:43.466 --> 00:45.356
set up by the Federal Bureau
of Investigation

00:45.364 --> 00:46.896
and the Hungarian
National Police

00:46.898 --> 00:49.332
to combat organized crime...

00:49.334 --> 00:52.502
(coughs)
Excuse me.

00:52.505 --> 00:54.969
The, uh, criminal enterprises
we're targeting

00:55.001 --> 00:57.574
are primarily made up of
Russian-speaking individuals

00:57.576 --> 00:58.742
from the former Soviet Union.

00:58.744 --> 01:00.176
GABI:
Excuse me,

01:00.178 --> 01:03.046
Agent, uh, Ball-hard?

01:03.048 --> 01:06.025
Uh, that's, uh,
it's Ballard, ma'am.

01:06.027 --> 01:08.551
You do know that
this is Prague, correct?

01:08.554 --> 01:09.755
(quiet laughter)

01:11.723 --> 01:13.323
Uh, uh, yes, ma'am,
I'm aware of that.

01:13.325 --> 01:15.504
And you do know that Prague
is in the Czech Republic?

01:15.506 --> 01:17.504
I know we probably
all look alike to you,

01:17.641 --> 01:19.019
but Budapest is in Hungary.

01:19.021 --> 01:21.275
And that's
another country entirely.

01:21.277 --> 01:22.303
Thank you.

01:23.358 --> 01:24.891
Sorry, please continue.

01:24.893 --> 01:26.426
BALLARD:
Thank you, sir.

01:26.428 --> 01:28.479
The entity we're
currently focused on

01:28.481 --> 01:30.130
is the Luhanskiy Brigade

01:30.132 --> 01:32.418
headed by this man
Viktor Luhanskiy,

01:32.420 --> 01:35.232
known as the <i> papka</i>
or the father of these men.

01:35.385 --> 01:37.737
Now, they have their hands in
everything from drug smuggling

01:37.739 --> 01:39.116
to bank robbery

01:39.118 --> 01:41.541
to human trafficking
throughout Central Europe.

01:41.543 --> 01:44.110
We have reason to believe
they're looking to expand

01:44.112 --> 01:47.448
their operation into Prague,
which as I understand it,

01:47.450 --> 01:49.849
is <i> not</i> in Hungary,
but is, in fact, the,

01:49.851 --> 01:51.617
the capital
of the Czech Republic

01:51.619 --> 01:55.000
as well as the historical seat
of the Holy Roman Empire.

01:58.193 --> 02:00.460
A particularly vicious
member of this group,

02:00.462 --> 02:03.763
who until recently was running
protection rackets in Budapest,

02:03.765 --> 02:05.131
has relocated to Prague

02:05.133 --> 02:06.966
with the intent, we believe,

02:06.968 --> 02:09.035
of expanding the Brigade's
heroin smuggling routes.

02:09.037 --> 02:11.866
His name is Dmitry Petrovich.

they should be polite,

02:39.067 --> 02:40.666
They will kill you.

02:40.668 --> 02:43.002
And I will enjoy
watching them do it.

02:43.004 --> 02:46.839
Well, I'm sure you want to be
one to deliver my message.

03:53.541 --> 03:56.042
Oh, nice!

03:56.044 --> 03:57.519
Cheers, then.

04:04.290 --> 04:06.519
<i>There's a hell of a lot
I don't remember,</i>

04:07.276 --> 04:09.324
<i>'cause of the injury,
I suppose.</i>

04:11.396 --> 04:12.945
<i>But maybe it's more than that.</i>

04:12.947 --> 04:15.379
<i>Maybe part of it is that
I've lived so many legends.</i>

04:17.065 --> 04:19.599
<i>Pretended to be

they're hunting me for...</i>

04:46.908 --> 04:48.902
<i>this murder
they say I committed...</i>

04:51.587 --> 04:53.466

I know I didn't do.</i>

find someone,</i>

05:02.696 --> 05:04.271
<i>anyone I recognize...</i>

05:07.536 --> 05:09.360
<i>maybe they could tell me
who I was...</i>

05:12.487 --> 05:14.798
<i>right before
all this started.</i>

05:15.860 --> 05:17.635
<i>And maybe I could
clear my name,</i>

05:17.865 --> 05:19.192

You expecting someone?

06:04.539 --> 06:05.204
Yeah,

06:05.206 --> 06:06.803
I don't mean to pry,
it's just...

06:07.490 --> 06:08.795
I've seen you
in here before.

06:09.226 --> 06:11.510
Always by yourself,
staring at that door

06:11.512 --> 06:12.534
like you're expecting

06:12.536 --> 06:14.699
your long-lost brother
to come waltzing in.

06:16.827 --> 06:17.663
Huh.

06:18.185 --> 06:19.685
So, am I right?

06:19.687 --> 06:21.187
Have you got
a long-lost brother?

06:21.455 --> 06:22.304
Yeah, I might.

06:23.263 --> 06:25.086
What, you don't know whether
you got a brother or not?

06:26.063 --> 06:27.353
I'm a bit forgetful.

06:30.619 --> 06:32.231
You're really not gonna tell me?

06:32.959 --> 06:34.300
Why are you so interested?

06:34.302 --> 06:36.502
Well, it's a way of getting
to know somebody, isn't it?

06:36.896 --> 06:38.003
What sort of work do you do?

06:38.005 --> 06:39.505
Do you come
from a big family?

06:39.507 --> 06:41.674
- What's your astrological sign?
- Leo.

06:42.229 --> 06:43.676
You see, we're getting
to know each other.

06:44.039 --> 06:45.378
I'm a Sagittarius myself.

06:45.380 --> 06:47.729

Leo.

Oh, I thought
that was your...

06:51.052 --> 06:53.386
No, I haven't got the foggiest
about astrological signs.

06:56.592 --> 06:57.490
Okay,

06:57.492 --> 07:00.356
Leo, who might
or might not have a brother.

07:03.670 --> 07:05.064
What about a girl?

07:06.367 --> 07:07.767
Have you got one of those?

07:12.822 --> 07:14.217
You could stay,
you know?

07:15.097 --> 07:15.966

- Wish I could.
- I won't cook you breakfast,

07:17.983 --> 07:20.880

cappuccinos in the morning.

identification, please?

07:59.390 --> 08:00.953
- What, is there a problem?
- What's your business here?

08:02.763 --> 08:04.017
Leave him alone, Rodger!

08:04.019 --> 08:05.197
Oh, seriously, Fiona,
this bloke?

08:05.199 --> 08:05.753
Oh, come off it!

08:05.755 --> 08:06.992
You and me aren't even
together anymore!

08:06.994 --> 08:08.508
Just stop hassling me
and my friends!

08:08.510 --> 08:09.635
Or you'll what...
You'll call the police?

08:09.637 --> 08:11.887
- Come on.
- Rodger...

08:11.889 --> 08:13.832
I think there's just been
a misunderstanding.

08:13.834 --> 08:15.801
Turn around,
hands behind your head.

08:17.591 --> 08:18.862
I'm sorry,
I'm-I'm not coming with you.

08:18.864 --> 08:20.281

like resisting arrest.

George one.

08:57.682 --> 08:59.143
George the First.

09:00.351 --> 09:02.563
Became king at age 14.

09:02.565 --> 09:04.209
Ruled for 50 years...
Who am I?

09:04.211 --> 09:05.336
Eddie three.

09:05.338 --> 09:06.704
Beg your pardon.

09:06.706 --> 09:08.694
Edward the Third.

09:09.040 --> 09:10.706
I married Catherine of Valois.

09:12.811 --> 09:15.464
Come on, boy,
you know this one.

09:15.467 --> 09:17.631
Married Catherine in 1420...
Who am I?

09:17.634 --> 09:18.849
David Bowie.

09:21.160 --> 09:22.171
What did you say?

09:22.271 --> 09:23.660
David Bowie.

09:24.070 --> 09:25.250
The First.

09:26.655 --> 09:29.923
I dismissed
Parliament in 1653

09:29.925 --> 09:31.858
and declared myself
Lord Protector...

09:31.860 --> 09:33.460
- Who am I?
- John Lennon.

09:33.959 --> 09:37.531
I married my cousin Prince Albert
of Saxe-Coburg in 1840.

Mick Jagger.

09:39.357 --> 09:40.537

09:41.010 --> 09:43.153
I am the fourth son of
William the Conqueror

09:43.156 --> 09:45.768
and ruled England from 1100 to 1135.

Who am I?

09:50.061 --> 09:51.834

- <i>My name is Martin Odum.</i>

10:05.583 --> 10:07.256
Tonight I claim responsibility

10:07.258 --> 10:09.678
for the killing
of FBI Director Dayle Bennett.

10:10.924 --> 10:12.122
Where did you get this?

10:13.137 --> 10:14.717
Only the most senior personnel

10:14.719 --> 10:16.274
are supposed to have
access to this recording.

10:16.276 --> 10:18.260
What the hell difference
does it make how I found it?

10:18.262 --> 10:20.707
The point is,
his name's not Odum.

10:21.417 --> 10:22.814
It's not John Cameron.

10:22.816 --> 10:24.051
It's Petrovich.

10:24.305 --> 10:25.743
Dmitry Petrovich.

10:25.745 --> 10:27.381
At least it was
when I investigated

10:27.383 --> 10:28.873
the son of a bitch
in Prague back in '01,

10:28.875 --> 10:31.262
which means he's probably
not really any of those people.

10:31.264 --> 10:33.007
- Ballard...
- And we have him

10:33.009 --> 10:34.670
on video confessing

10:34.672 --> 10:36.572
to the cold-blooded
assassination

10:36.574 --> 10:39.241
of the director of this agency.

10:39.243 --> 10:40.743
- Ballard...
- And no one

10:40.745 --> 10:42.129
is asking the obvious question,
all right?

10:42.131 --> 10:45.012
Who is that guy, really?
Who-who is he working for?

10:45.014 --> 10:47.515
Why in the name of Christ is there
not an international manhunt...

10:47.518 --> 10:48.482
Enough!

10:50.355 --> 10:51.887
You've been with the
Bureau long enough

10:51.889 --> 10:53.218
to know the guys
upstairs don't want

10:53.220 --> 10:55.321
the embarrassment of admitting
that we let one of our own

10:55.323 --> 10:57.991
get away with an act
of terrorism in our sandbox.

10:57.993 --> 10:59.993
So, what, to save face,
we're-we're just gonna sweep

10:59.995 --> 11:01.727
a capital crime under the rug?

11:01.729 --> 11:04.256
We're handling the
investigation internally.

11:04.259 --> 11:05.101
(scoffs)

11:09.763 --> 11:11.348
Okay. Well, then I want in.

11:12.479 --> 11:15.008
I mean, I followed
that sick bastard for months.

11:15.010 --> 11:18.552
- I had him heroin smuggling, murder...
- Ballard,

11:18.554 --> 11:21.714
you're not a field agent anymore.
And you want to keep

11:21.716 --> 11:24.918
the job you still have,
you'll forget you ever saw this.

11:26.706 --> 11:27.929
I can't forget.

11:30.509 --> 11:32.053
Look, I'm sorry, Curtis.

11:32.562 --> 11:35.895
But trust me...
We will find this guy.

11:37.031 --> 11:39.865
We've got our best people
looking for him.

11:43.238 --> 11:45.672
Yeah.

12:02.093 --> 12:03.690
Back on the juice, huh?

12:04.730 --> 12:06.398
Hard to give up
certain vices.

12:07.821 --> 12:09.414
It's good to see you again,
Nina.

12:12.871 --> 12:14.601
You have no right
calling in favors.

12:16.224 --> 12:17.500
You didn't have to come.

12:20.608 --> 12:22.290
So, who is this John Cameron

12:22.292 --> 12:23.610
and why is he
so important to you?

12:26.019 --> 12:28.269
Keeping secrets
from a spy.

12:30.904 --> 12:32.885
Careful, Tony, you
might get burned.

12:33.549 --> 12:35.839
Guess I'm gonna have
to watch my back then, huh?

12:42.049 --> 12:43.396
(sighs)

12:43.988 --> 12:46.225
Opposite the Charing
Cross tube station

12:47.645 --> 12:49.353
there's a hole-in-the-wall
called Carmine's.

12:50.543 --> 12:52.407
Ask for a to-go
order for Steven.

12:54.040 --> 12:56.168
This circles back,
it'll bite me in the ass.

12:56.171 --> 12:57.266
That's not gonna happen.

13:02.117 --> 13:03.260
Nina.

13:04.619 --> 13:06.201
Am I allowed to say that...

13:07.259 --> 13:08.843
London's done right by you?

13:11.443 --> 13:12.825
Have fun with your wife.

13:18.333 --> 13:19.864
(knocking)

13:21.803 --> 13:24.400
(music playing softly)

13:27.342 --> 13:28.363
(music stops)

13:28.712 --> 13:29.776
Don't you knock?

13:30.445 --> 13:32.812
I did. Twice.

13:32.814 --> 13:34.586
Bus leaves in ten.

13:38.873 --> 13:40.019
Okay.

13:52.174 --> 13:55.034
- Have a lovely day, Kate.
- Yeah, you, too, Liam.

13:58.006 --> 14:00.006
(indistinct chatter)

14:00.008 --> 14:02.475
(scooter approaching)

14:04.578 --> 14:05.411
You're late.

14:05.413 --> 14:07.847
Good morning to you, too,
sunshine.

14:08.574 --> 14:10.416
I hope you brought something
to change into.

14:10.418 --> 14:11.984
So now I'm an idiot?

14:19.761 --> 14:21.060
You'll miss Chemistry.

14:21.062 --> 14:23.062
And life as we know it

14:23.064 --> 14:24.897
shall cease to exist.

14:31.406 --> 14:33.840
(indistinct chatter)

14:37.340 --> 14:38.774
Over there.

14:45.668 --> 14:47.573
Salaam alaikum.

14:49.357 --> 14:51.051
<i>Alaikum as-salaam.</i>

14:52.951 --> 14:55.795
- _
- As-salaam alaikum, my little princess.

14:56.419 --> 14:58.410
What are you
drawing? The sun?

14:58.412 --> 15:02.101
You're drawing a sun?
Look, the sun smiles on you.

15:02.976 --> 15:04.036
(both chuckle)

15:04.038 --> 15:05.638
(speaks indistinctly)

15:07.574 --> 15:09.575
(both laugh)

15:09.577 --> 15:10.777
(speaks Russian)

15:12.953 --> 15:14.647
I told you, no more Russian.

15:14.649 --> 15:17.750
Go and find your
mama. Come on. Go.

15:17.752 --> 15:19.619
Go on, quick,
quick, quick, quick.

15:19.621 --> 15:21.220
Quick, quick, quick, quick.

15:26.936 --> 15:28.261
You bring business to our home?

15:28.263 --> 15:29.814
It couldn't wait.

15:38.093 --> 15:40.526
Some Russian guy
almost killed him.

15:44.070 --> 15:45.409
You.

15:46.753 --> 15:49.515
Get me delivery schedule
for last month.

15:50.359 --> 15:51.517
Go!

16:00.066 --> 16:03.413
_

16:04.245 --> 16:05.446
_

16:05.746 --> 16:08.302
_

16:11.552 --> 16:15.807
_

16:17.203 --> 16:21.044
_

16:21.125 --> 16:23.125
_

16:25.486 --> 16:28.554
(footsteps approaching)

16:30.398 --> 16:31.689
JANIC:
That's him.

16:40.128 --> 16:41.105
Who are you?

16:42.991 --> 16:45.538
(speaks Russian)

16:45.540 --> 16:46.806
You're speaking the language
of the people

16:46.808 --> 16:48.207
who murdered my family,

16:48.740 --> 16:49.865
destroyed my country.

16:49.868 --> 16:51.143
Chechens, Russians.

16:51.145 --> 16:52.653
That's politics.

16:53.213 --> 16:54.667
I only care about money.

16:55.775 --> 16:57.850
So beat my associate
and now you think

16:57.852 --> 17:00.753
- I do business with you, huh?
- Your associate

17:00.755 --> 17:03.189
is amateur. I know people
all over continent,

17:03.815 --> 17:05.191
Britain, U.S.

17:05.193 --> 17:08.607
With your product and my
contacts, we become very rich.

17:09.634 --> 17:10.851
JANIC: What are you waiting for?

17:10.853 --> 17:12.898
- Kill him.
- Why don't you ask your friend here

17:12.901 --> 17:14.557
why he has Swiss bank account.

17:16.253 --> 17:18.029
Maybe because he's
skimming product.

17:18.406 --> 17:19.771
Selling it on side.

17:26.414 --> 17:27.380
JANIC:
Doku,

17:27.842 --> 17:29.115
I will pay you

17:29.117 --> 17:30.557
every-every dollar.

17:43.229 --> 17:44.689
You have big balls.

17:49.148 --> 17:50.403
But if you betray me,

17:51.230 --> 17:52.669
I'll cut them off.

17:57.044 --> 17:59.423
- Have you been to Oddono's?
- No. Where's that?

17:59.612 --> 18:00.755
South Ken.

18:01.016 --> 18:02.603
Did you try the salted caramel?

18:02.838 --> 18:04.011
Oh, my God, it's to die for.

18:05.018 --> 18:06.527
We'll have to meet there
next time.

18:08.138 --> 18:09.196
- Brilliant.
- So,

18:09.856 --> 18:12.999
Crawford.
That's for sure not Chechen.

18:13.611 --> 18:16.677
That's my stepdad.
He's from Surrey.

18:17.087 --> 18:19.038
Solicitor. Enough said.

18:19.943 --> 18:21.073
Your mum then?

18:22.128 --> 18:23.676
Not that she'd ever admit it.

18:24.480 --> 18:26.512
But I found an old Soviet
I.D. she kept hidden.

18:27.409 --> 18:29.543
I guess it was the only picture
she had of her mum.

18:30.595 --> 18:33.540
Her name was Arsanova.
I Googled it.

18:33.830 --> 18:35.187
Must have been a bit of a shock.

18:36.673 --> 18:39.392
She told me her village was bombed
in the First Chechen War.

18:40.584 --> 18:42.562
My grandmother died
in a refugee camp.

18:43.208 --> 18:44.563
- That's awful.
- Mmm.

18:45.464 --> 18:47.433
She made me promise not
to tell my stepdad.

18:49.333 --> 18:51.420
I think she's ashamed
to be Muslim or something.

18:54.108 --> 18:55.969
He just thinks
we emigrated from Russia.

18:56.974 --> 18:58.754
That's what
I always thought, too.

18:59.159 --> 19:01.124
Now you want
to embrace your true faith.

19:01.126 --> 19:02.604
That's why I was so
excited to meet you.

19:03.493 --> 19:05.216
I want to finally
be who I really am.

19:06.949 --> 19:08.765
You don't cover your head.

19:09.930 --> 19:11.936
My family wouldn't understand.

19:12.845 --> 19:16.262
But I've been reading the Koran
and praying five times a day.

19:18.933 --> 19:20.177
Your earrings,

19:20.931 --> 19:21.866
very pretty.

19:22.989 --> 19:24.314
Thank you.

19:24.636 --> 19:25.816
But they're <i> haram.</i>

19:25.818 --> 19:26.938
Forbidden.

19:28.037 --> 19:29.274
I didn't know.

19:29.688 --> 19:31.724
That's okay. You'll learn.

19:31.727 --> 19:32.592
I want to.

19:33.236 --> 19:34.465
Rule number one,

19:34.468 --> 19:36.493
you can be very flash if
you're discreet about it.

19:36.495 --> 19:38.656
They just opened a Footpatrol
in Notting Hill.

19:38.659 --> 19:40.463
Coolest kicks in London.

19:40.465 --> 19:42.132
(chuckles)

19:42.134 --> 19:43.602
You're a sneakerhead.

19:43.604 --> 19:45.669
Shall we go shopping, ladies?

19:55.515 --> 19:57.931
He's turned onto Adelaide.
Headed north.

20:07.422 --> 20:10.327
Hey, my friend, how you doing?
Good to see you.

20:11.123 --> 20:13.774
You've been following me for the
last 20 minutes. Who are you?

20:14.066 --> 20:16.811
Okay, relax. I'm Bureau. OPR.

20:22.397 --> 20:23.740
Want to know
what you're doing in London.

20:23.742 --> 20:25.294
I'm on vacation with my wife,
asshole.

20:25.555 --> 20:27.210
Yeah, well, we have reason
to believe you're attempting

20:27.212 --> 20:28.378
to make contact with the agent

20:28.380 --> 20:29.846
known as Martin Odum.

20:29.848 --> 20:31.348
Oh, yeah? You know, it's funny.
I thought

20:31.350 --> 20:32.349
the Bureau was supposed
to use their resources

20:32.351 --> 20:33.497
to track terrorists,

20:34.404 --> 20:36.319
not civil servants
on their second honeymoons.

20:36.321 --> 20:38.488
And by the way, I made your
little girlfriend six blocks ago.

20:38.490 --> 20:40.223
You two need to go back
to Quantico.

20:40.225 --> 20:41.558
Retake your surveillance course.

20:42.397 --> 20:43.694
Rookie.

20:46.598 --> 20:48.164
(engine starts)

20:55.882 --> 20:57.028
MAN:
Looks professional.

20:57.709 --> 21:00.777
Also looks to me like you idiots
initiated this confrontation.

21:00.779 --> 21:03.380
He resisted arrest,
assaulted us.

21:04.413 --> 21:06.017
That's GBH, sir.

21:08.821 --> 21:09.853
All right.

21:09.855 --> 21:11.855
Have I.T. grab the
best frame they can.

21:11.857 --> 21:13.551
We'll put it out citywide.

21:27.864 --> 21:29.448
Look like shit.

21:31.634 --> 21:32.943
Nice to see you, too.

21:33.249 --> 21:34.420
How you holding up?

21:36.321 --> 21:37.314
Blew it, Tony.

21:37.316 --> 21:38.917
Beat the crap
out of two coppers.

21:39.862 --> 21:41.713
And they caught
the whole thing on CCTV.

21:41.716 --> 21:43.050
Jesus, Martin,
what were you thinking?

21:43.053 --> 21:43.812
I wasn't.

21:44.255 --> 21:47.195
I was sick and tired of
wandering the streets, hiding.

21:48.427 --> 21:50.005
I went home with a girl.

21:50.372 --> 21:51.461
It was stupid.

21:51.997 --> 21:53.133
Yeah, I've been there.

21:53.832 --> 21:55.265
Look, I'll keep an eye out,

21:55.267 --> 21:56.800
see if your face pops up
on the wire.

21:56.802 --> 21:58.324
But let's make this quick.

21:58.637 --> 22:00.226
Had to shake
a Bureau tail myself.

22:01.073 --> 22:04.040
There's a report listing John
Cameron as killed in action.

22:05.650 --> 22:07.483
There are three agents read onto
the operation, all right?

22:07.516 --> 22:08.682
All aliases of course.

22:08.684 --> 22:10.684
But my contact
source in Six

22:10.686 --> 22:12.242
was willing to
give her a name.

22:12.245 --> 22:13.841
Guess 'cause guy's
retired or something.

22:13.844 --> 22:15.344
Gave her an address, too.

22:15.851 --> 22:17.453
_

22:17.456 --> 22:18.605
Terrence Graves.

22:20.343 --> 22:22.944
He might be able to help me
fill in some of the blanks.

22:24.180 --> 22:25.580
Martin, have you ever considered

22:25.582 --> 22:26.951
that you might not like
what you find?

22:28.413 --> 22:30.919
John Cameron was declared
killed in action.

22:30.921 --> 22:34.088
So maybe Six paid him
a death benefit... next of kin.

22:34.845 --> 22:36.779
Okay, I'll have my contact reach out,
see what she can find out.

22:37.224 --> 22:38.510
All right.

22:39.450 --> 22:41.224
Why are you sticking
your neck out for me anyway?

22:41.226 --> 22:43.015
Think I'm gonna let you go down
for something you didn't do?

22:45.288 --> 22:47.522
Look, this is clean.

22:48.086 --> 22:49.024
We need to keep these

22:49.026 --> 22:50.653
little strolls in the park
to a minimum.

22:55.529 --> 22:57.407
Have you heard
from Sonya and Aiden?

22:57.481 --> 22:59.314
Yeah. Yeah,
they're good.

22:59.316 --> 23:00.487
- Safe.
- Yeah?

23:00.489 --> 23:02.889
Apparently he got himself
elected to student council.

23:03.488 --> 23:05.428
- Yeah.
- Hate to tell you this, but your kid

23:05.430 --> 23:07.030
may just grow up
to be a politician.

23:07.033 --> 23:08.866
(chuckles)

23:09.469 --> 23:11.168
(sighs):
You know, Edward III...

23:11.180 --> 23:13.300
was 14 when
he lost his father...

23:14.368 --> 23:15.734
became King of England.

23:15.736 --> 23:17.004
Ruled for 50 years.

23:17.526 --> 23:18.505
Never know.

23:18.508 --> 23:20.141
I didn't know
you were a history buff.

23:20.700 --> 23:22.013
No, neither did I.

23:22.645 --> 23:23.633
(chuckles)

23:25.049 --> 23:26.079
You want me
to get him a message?

23:26.514 --> 23:27.948
Nah, it's, uh...

23:28.850 --> 23:31.169
it's not safe for him
to be in contact with me.

23:31.664 --> 23:32.755
You know, it's...

23:34.491 --> 23:35.455
it's better like this.

23:36.530 --> 23:37.435
I've got
to figure out

23:37.437 --> 23:38.441
who the hell I am and prove

23:38.443 --> 23:39.609
I didn't do what they say I did

23:39.611 --> 23:41.250
before I start playing
happy families.

23:44.973 --> 23:46.194
Be careful, Martin.

23:46.937 --> 23:48.342
Cheers, Tony.

23:49.269 --> 23:50.329
Better go, eh?

23:56.138 --> 23:58.236
- Hi.
- Can I help you, sir?

23:58.986 --> 24:01.441
Yes, uh, Terrence Graves' room,
please.

24:01.443 --> 24:02.376
Name?

24:02.378 --> 24:03.557
Leo Parks.

24:03.727 --> 24:04.926
Sign in, please.

24:06.396 --> 24:07.795
(sighs)

24:12.600 --> 24:14.235
I'm sorry, sir.
Mr. Graves is only allowed

24:14.237 --> 24:15.770
to have approved visitors.

24:15.772 --> 24:17.672
I don't see you on the list.

24:17.674 --> 24:20.620
Really?
Oh, I've come all the way

24:20.622 --> 24:21.810
from Leeds to see him.

24:21.812 --> 24:23.912
Oh. You're an old friend, then?

24:23.914 --> 24:25.747
Yeah, we go way back.

24:26.619 --> 24:29.393
It'd mean a lot to me, and it
would mean a lot to Terry.

24:29.569 --> 24:31.177
I'm only down for the night,
so I don't know

24:31.179 --> 24:32.654
if I'm gonna get a chance
to see him again.

24:32.656 --> 24:33.822
You know what I mean?

24:35.258 --> 24:37.292
Room 217.

24:38.475 --> 24:40.162
Thank you.
You're very kind.

24:50.556 --> 24:51.659
Mr. Graves?

24:54.110 --> 24:56.477
(laughs)

24:56.479 --> 24:59.436
Why are you calling me
Mr. Graves?

24:59.438 --> 25:00.615
Well, I-I thought you...

25:00.617 --> 25:01.616
Billy.

25:01.618 --> 25:03.051
Billy,

25:03.053 --> 25:05.126
my son, I've missed you so much.

25:06.690 --> 25:08.756
(patting back)
(laughs)

25:10.234 --> 25:12.493
My dear boy.

25:13.237 --> 25:14.462
Where have you been?

25:15.527 --> 25:17.398
Well, I've been, uh...

25:17.400 --> 25:18.870
Have you been to see
your sister?

25:21.023 --> 25:22.310
My sister?

25:23.527 --> 25:25.168
- No, I...
- She'll be so pleased.

25:27.946 --> 25:29.118
MAN:
Excuse me?

25:29.781 --> 25:31.984
It's Parks,
is it?

25:32.884 --> 25:33.747
Yes.

25:33.801 --> 25:36.116
They said at the desk
you'd signed in.

25:36.599 --> 25:38.188
What-What's your business here?

25:40.002 --> 25:41.668
Well, I'm-I'm...

25:41.670 --> 25:43.045
I'm here to see my...

25:44.339 --> 25:45.939
(panting)

25:45.941 --> 25:47.474
I'm here to...

25:50.381 --> 25:51.899
Sorry, who are you?

25:52.692 --> 25:54.278
I'm William Graves, his son.

26:03.263 --> 26:04.524
Billy?

26:07.296 --> 26:10.321
- My boy!
- It's okay, Dad. I'm here.

26:10.532 --> 26:12.106
I've missed you
so much.

26:13.703 --> 26:14.836
(chuckles)

26:15.270 --> 26:16.390
Come on.

26:19.493 --> 26:23.152
_

26:27.113 --> 26:28.870
(Gabi speaks Czech)

26:29.716 --> 26:30.715
You want coffee?

26:31.718 --> 26:33.442
Uh, no, thank you.

26:34.053 --> 26:34.940
Hmm?

26:36.258 --> 26:38.322
No, I... told you, I don't smoke.

26:39.292 --> 26:40.939
(sighs)

26:41.711 --> 26:43.394
No coffee, no cigarettes.

26:43.396 --> 26:45.230
What kind of cop are you?

26:46.299 --> 26:48.233
(laughs): Next thing
you'll tell me you don't drink.

26:50.670 --> 26:52.169
Well, uh...

26:53.886 --> 26:55.961
I can see
this is going to be fun.

27:02.184 --> 27:03.296
Did you see that?

27:03.298 --> 27:05.269
The owner just passed him
some cash.

27:07.185 --> 27:08.352
It's good coffee.

27:08.776 --> 27:10.187
A few weeks in town,
he's already got

27:10.189 --> 27:12.019
the locals paying him
protection?

27:14.193 --> 27:15.960
He's so brazen.

27:16.518 --> 27:18.383
That's how we're going
to catch him.

27:23.358 --> 27:26.406
_

27:28.274 --> 27:29.774
(computer beeps)

27:56.135 --> 27:57.702
(sets glass down)

27:57.704 --> 27:59.770
(sighing)

28:27.433 --> 28:29.633
(sighs)

28:32.699 --> 28:33.884
_

28:33.887 --> 28:35.183
NISCO: <i>I think it's important
she learns to play</i>

28:35.185 --> 28:36.373
on a team,
and I don't think

28:36.375 --> 28:37.942
we should just
let her quit mid-season.

28:38.371 --> 28:40.428
My parents would have
never let me do that.

28:45.832 --> 28:47.765
Does the subject of our children bore you?

28:47.767 --> 28:49.488
No, I'm sorry. I think this jet lag

28:49.490 --> 28:51.854
is catching up with me.
I'm having a great time.

28:55.637 --> 28:57.212
Me, too.

28:58.478 --> 29:00.644
You know, I've got
to use the loo.

29:00.646 --> 29:03.378
Ooh, it's sexy
when you talk British.

29:10.023 --> 29:12.623
(footsteps approaching)

29:12.625 --> 29:15.827
Jesus! Martin, you almost
made me piss on my new shoes.

29:15.829 --> 29:16.981
I went to see Graves.

29:18.198 --> 29:20.426
His memory's shot.
Alzheimer's, I think.

29:20.428 --> 29:22.149
He couldn't
tell me anything.

29:22.935 --> 29:24.943
- Damn. Sorry about that.
- I've got another lead.

29:24.945 --> 29:27.336
Okay, you know what? That's what
the burner phone is for, okay?

29:27.338 --> 29:28.740
I'm trying to have
dinner with my wife.

29:28.742 --> 29:29.965
I had to give
you this.

29:30.442 --> 29:32.214
I lifted it from
the nurses' station.

29:32.216 --> 29:34.383
Anybody who visited
Graves had to sign in.

29:34.386 --> 29:36.987
Maybe one of them knows
about him, or about me.

29:36.989 --> 29:38.922
Get your contact
to run the names.

29:38.924 --> 29:41.525
All right, I'll try, but it
could take a couple of days.

29:41.527 --> 29:42.945
In the meantime
you need to lay low

29:42.947 --> 29:44.222
and stay out of...

29:46.006 --> 29:47.303
trouble.

29:57.262 --> 29:58.491
Where have you been?

29:59.531 --> 30:01.165
Studying with Marjorie.

30:01.167 --> 30:02.732
I called her.
Try again.

30:03.463 --> 30:05.769
Jesus, Mum, you call my friends?

30:06.203 --> 30:07.668
The school called, too.

30:07.670 --> 30:09.254
They say you
were not in class.

30:10.277 --> 30:12.142
So I ask you again,
where have you been?

30:12.862 --> 30:15.431
- Out.
- Katya, what's going on with you?

30:15.433 --> 30:16.946
Don't call me that.

30:42.050 --> 30:44.183
(phone buzzing)
(gasps)

30:51.082 --> 30:52.182
(beep)

30:53.035 --> 30:53.650
Yeah?

30:53.652 --> 30:56.021
RICE: Martin,
my contact ran those names.

30:56.558 --> 30:57.320
And?

30:57.322 --> 30:59.956
And you were right about those
death benefits for John Cameron.

31:00.977 --> 31:02.299
And get this.

31:02.748 --> 31:04.810
They're being paid to someone
who visits the old man.

31:05.295 --> 31:06.505
I got an address for you.

31:07.666 --> 31:09.399
(birds chirping)

31:20.611 --> 31:21.973
BOY:
<i>Aaron Ramsey says</i>

31:21.975 --> 31:24.065
his dad is getting
a Ferrari.

31:24.067 --> 31:27.119
- Aaron Ramsey's a wanker.
- Language.

31:27.121 --> 31:29.225
Finish your breakfast. I don't
want to be late again today.

31:29.227 --> 31:31.046
LIAM: Well, tell them when they pay
their bill, that's when we'll start.

31:31.904 --> 31:33.455
KATE:
Is there any toast?

31:34.650 --> 31:36.567
I'm gonna call you back.

31:38.377 --> 31:40.524
What's that
on your head, Katie?

31:41.092 --> 31:41.965
It's called a hijab.

31:41.967 --> 31:43.580
RANDOLPH:
Why are you wearing it?

31:43.582 --> 31:44.986
To show my devotion to God.

31:46.167 --> 31:48.697
BOBBY: I think it looks pretty on you.

31:48.699 --> 31:49.844
Thanks, muffinhead.

31:51.123 --> 31:52.425
I don't want
to miss my bus.

31:52.427 --> 31:53.997
Car. Now.

32:02.420 --> 32:04.020
(door opens)

32:04.022 --> 32:05.488
Her devotion to God?

32:05.490 --> 32:06.816
What, she thinks
she's a bloody Muslim?

32:08.246 --> 32:09.665
I don't know what
she thinks anymore.

32:09.667 --> 32:11.227
Where on earth did she
get an idea like that?

32:12.179 --> 32:13.908
She's a teenager.
She's just trying

32:13.910 --> 32:15.869
- to get some reaction from us.
- She couldn't try

32:15.871 --> 32:18.453
some normal form of rebellion
like drugs or sex?

32:21.101 --> 32:23.573
Let's go, please, boys.
Let's go in the car.

32:29.047 --> 32:30.209
Come on.

32:31.583 --> 32:32.782
In the car, please.

32:34.019 --> 32:35.419
Go, darling.

32:36.554 --> 32:38.788
(car engine starts,
car door closes)

33:06.615 --> 33:09.149
(birds singing)

33:24.498 --> 33:25.931
(door squeaks open)

33:46.854 --> 33:48.687
(child laughing)

33:49.707 --> 33:51.123
(laughter)

33:53.278 --> 33:54.826
(door opens)

33:54.828 --> 33:57.130
(speaking Russian)

33:57.318 --> 33:58.817
Where did I leave it?

34:10.397 --> 34:11.958
(sighs)

34:22.275 --> 34:23.831
(crying)

34:28.649 --> 34:29.960
(crying)

34:30.985 --> 34:32.088
(speaking Russian)

34:34.989 --> 34:36.366
(crying)

34:39.007 --> 34:39.925
(sniffles)

34:39.927 --> 34:40.693
(sighs)

34:48.268 --> 34:49.907
(keys jingling)

34:50.771 --> 34:52.938
(birds singing)

35:13.934 --> 35:14.960
Isn't that the bloke?

35:14.962 --> 35:16.297
Could be.

35:35.516 --> 35:36.791
(speaking Russian)

35:40.834 --> 35:42.255
_

35:42.356 --> 35:43.375
Uh, eh, eh, eh.

35:46.670 --> 35:47.973
_

35:47.976 --> 35:50.061
(speaking Russian)

35:50.064 --> 35:53.198
- No, I don't speak Russian.
- You just talk me Russian.

35:53.200 --> 35:54.933
- I don't.
- (speaking Russian)

35:54.935 --> 35:56.335
I don't think so.

35:56.337 --> 35:57.081
Russian...

35:57.838 --> 35:59.438
Dmitry?

36:08.882 --> 36:11.183
(car engine revving,
car horn honks)

36:11.185 --> 36:12.818
(yells)

36:14.888 --> 36:18.824
(car engine revving)

36:20.694 --> 36:23.362
(grunting)

36:29.470 --> 36:31.169
(panting)

36:34.408 --> 36:35.974
(grunts)

36:44.652 --> 36:45.755
Hurry up! Come on!

36:45.757 --> 36:48.917
(grunts) Bloody hell, he's jammed it!
Call for backup.

36:48.919 --> 36:51.623
Requesting assistance.
Suspect is heading

36:51.625 --> 36:53.684
north down the alley
behind Village Café.

36:54.928 --> 36:58.430
(panting, loud crowd chatter)

36:58.432 --> 36:59.293
There!

37:13.180 --> 37:14.913
Hey, come back here!

37:18.252 --> 37:20.552
(sirens blaring,
engine revving)

37:22.690 --> 37:24.656
(engine revving)

37:24.658 --> 37:26.992
(tires squealing)

37:35.232 --> 37:38.005
_

37:39.340 --> 37:41.840
(airplane engine whirring)

37:43.977 --> 37:46.411
(woman speaks
in foreign language over P.A.)

37:46.460 --> 37:48.460
_

37:49.413 --> 37:51.413
_

37:52.116 --> 37:54.522
_

37:54.805 --> 37:56.805
_

37:56.938 --> 37:58.465
_

37:59.032 --> 38:00.612
_

38:00.813 --> 38:01.911
_

38:02.063 --> 38:04.063
_

38:04.423 --> 38:06.490
(phone buzzing)

38:16.101 --> 38:18.569
(boat horn blows)

38:46.244 --> 38:47.401
You're late.

38:47.404 --> 38:48.593
(laughs)

38:49.105 --> 38:50.905
I'm <i> always</i> late, remember?

38:51.601 --> 38:52.668
(laughing):
Yes.

38:54.675 --> 38:57.537
So, you were so mysterious
on the phone.

38:58.164 --> 38:59.314
What brings you back to Prague?

38:59.942 --> 39:01.777
Lots of vacation time saved up.

39:01.779 --> 39:03.979
Thought I'd visit an old friend.

39:08.571 --> 39:11.416
He's the patron saint
against calumnies, Curtis.

39:11.418 --> 39:14.026
Very bad luck to lie
in front of him.

39:16.044 --> 39:17.498
How about a drink?

39:18.879 --> 39:19.981
(laughing):
My God.

39:21.648 --> 39:23.211
What's happened to you?

39:25.040 --> 39:27.429
Oh, I'm a whole new man
these days, Gabi.

39:43.264 --> 39:46.351
_

39:47.120 --> 39:48.242
What the hell is this?

39:48.343 --> 39:50.343
_

39:50.562 --> 39:52.460
- It's not what you think.
- Really?

39:52.462 --> 39:54.293
You're on vacation with me,

39:55.001 --> 39:56.828
and you're calling <i> her.</i>

40:02.073 --> 40:03.235
It's work.

40:03.237 --> 40:05.038
Oh, now I feel so much better,

40:06.266 --> 40:09.041
because I haven't heard
that one before.

40:15.678 --> 40:17.393
(laptop chimes)

40:21.238 --> 40:24.819
_

40:27.554 --> 40:29.279
_

40:29.282 --> 40:31.599
MAN: <i>As-salaam alaikum.</i>
(speaking Arabic)

40:40.238 --> 40:41.834
You should pray, too.

40:54.777 --> 40:58.091
_

41:19.802 --> 41:22.824
_

41:22.827 --> 41:25.116
(indistinct shouting)

41:26.370 --> 41:28.070
That's very good.

41:28.489 --> 41:29.558
Go on.

41:30.249 --> 41:31.968
You may go and play
football with the lads now.

41:35.742 --> 41:38.531
I don't think you know how
special you are... yet.

41:39.538 --> 41:40.641
Do you?

41:44.203 --> 41:47.228
That is why I drive you so hard.

41:47.525 --> 41:48.307
Because

41:49.267 --> 41:50.745
if you do as I say...

41:52.412 --> 41:54.240
there's no telling
who you might become.
