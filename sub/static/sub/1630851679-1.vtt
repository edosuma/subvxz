retire, but he won't listen.

right?

05:27.328 --> 05:28.927

keep your distance.

05:56.657 --> 05:58.990

05:59.126 --> 06:00.659

06:00.794 --> 06:02.761
They attacked each other,
and myself.

06:02.763 --> 06:05.163
And renard seems to think
that you, and only you,

06:05.232 --> 06:07.332
Can figure out what
the problem is, and fix it.

06:07.467 --> 06:11.002
Of course, if you choose
not to work with them...

06:11.038 --> 06:13.337

06:13.374 --> 06:15.673
But really, you don't
have to stay here.

06:15.709 --> 06:17.975
- No, I have to,
it's my job, apparently.

06:20.481 --> 06:23.448
- All right, well,
let's get them settled in.

06:23.583 --> 06:25.550
How long have you been working
with renard?

06:25.552 --> 06:28.286
- Oh, almost ten years.
Oh my, is it really that long?

06:28.355 --> 06:29.987
I can't believe it.

06:33.394 --> 06:35.627

06:37.898 --> 06:40.432
Garland calls me up,
(water runs)

06:40.501 --> 06:44.903
And he's wondering why tim
doesn't return his calls.

06:46.173 --> 06:48.706
And he wants to talk to him.
- Yeah?

06:48.742 --> 06:50.575
- To tim. He's doesn't
wanna talk to me.

06:50.611 --> 06:52.577
So when I ask him why,

06:52.579 --> 06:54.646
He says, well,

06:54.648 --> 06:56.781
Because since...

06:56.784 --> 07:01.118
I've always been adverse
to expanding

07:01.155 --> 07:03.054
The heartland herd,

07:03.056 --> 07:04.723
He thought he'd have better
luck convincing tim

07:04.725 --> 07:06.458
To buy 'em.

07:06.593 --> 07:08.793
- Oh, t-- I'm sorry.
To buy what?

07:08.796 --> 07:11.329
- Mitch's herd.
- Oh!

07:11.331 --> 07:13.130
- Mitch is selling his herd?

07:13.167 --> 07:16.067
- Well, yeah, and the property
at aspen grove.

07:16.069 --> 07:18.503
You must have known.

07:18.639 --> 07:20.872
- No. No, I didn't know.

07:22.843 --> 07:24.609
(receding footsteps)
(jack exhales)

07:24.611 --> 07:27.479
- What else did fred say?
- Oh, more of the same.

07:28.682 --> 07:31.483
He figured I was happy
just being the figurehead

07:31.552 --> 07:33.485
Of heartland beef,

07:33.620 --> 07:36.621
And that I might be wrapping up
my involvement by now.

07:36.623 --> 07:38.523
What does he mean, "by now"?

07:39.659 --> 07:42.393
- I'm guessing that he means
at this point

07:42.463 --> 07:44.629
In some people's career,
some men would...

07:44.665 --> 07:46.498
Want to take a step back.

07:46.567 --> 07:48.766
- Ah, you mean,
some men my age.

07:49.870 --> 07:52.704
- No, I don't mean age.
You're successful.

07:52.706 --> 07:55.240
So maybe he thinks you wanna
stop and smell the roses.

07:55.242 --> 07:57.575
- Oh! "smell the roses."

07:57.644 --> 08:01.312
- I don't mean literally
smell roses, jack.

08:04.218 --> 08:05.583
(birds chirp)

08:05.652 --> 08:07.318

08:07.354 --> 08:09.054
You're going to school
in the fall?

08:09.189 --> 08:11.256
- No, I'm going to school
tomorrow.

08:11.391 --> 08:13.391
- No, honey, that's not school.
- Yes, it is.

08:13.460 --> 08:15.026
(amy chuckles)

08:15.161 --> 08:17.362

program for kids like lyndy

08:17.364 --> 08:19.463
Who don't have daycare
or nursery school experience.

08:19.500 --> 08:21.533
It teaches them how
to behave in the classroom.

08:21.668 --> 08:23.768
- It's the summer!

08:23.837 --> 08:26.437
Kids need to be outside
playing,

08:26.473 --> 08:28.607
And making their own
adventures,

08:28.609 --> 08:30.742
Not learning to sit at a desk.

08:30.744 --> 08:33.477
They've got plenty of years
ahead of 'em to be doing that.

08:33.514 --> 08:35.747
- I would agree, I think
it's a little bit premature.

08:35.749 --> 08:38.350
- It's not! And you know what?
It'll be good for you, too.

08:38.352 --> 08:40.818
You need to learn to let
the baby bird leave the nest.

08:42.322 --> 08:46.157

tell us about travelling

08:46.226 --> 08:47.826

<i> dark horse.</i>

08:47.961 --> 08:50.028
What is that like?
- It's wonderful.

08:50.030 --> 08:52.564
I've been all around the world,

08:52.633 --> 08:54.499
Met interesting people,

08:54.501 --> 08:56.768
Not to mention the beautiful
horses I get to perform with.

08:56.903 --> 08:59.571
- It must be incredible.
- It is.

08:59.640 --> 09:02.307
It's exhausting, you know,
all the rehearsing,

09:02.442 --> 09:05.310
And travelling,
and press and training,

09:05.445 --> 09:07.312
But... I love it.

09:07.314 --> 09:08.780
It's my dream job.

09:09.850 --> 09:11.583
- What do you do?

09:11.652 --> 09:13.618
- I dance with horses.

09:13.753 --> 09:15.220
Do you like horses?

09:15.355 --> 09:16.955
- I love them.

09:16.957 --> 09:18.923
- Oh! (laughs)
so do I.

09:18.992 --> 09:20.659
(alarm beeps) oh!

09:20.661 --> 09:23.728
Um... But I must excuse myself.
I have to get my sleep.

09:23.764 --> 09:25.463
I get up early to do
my own workout,

09:25.532 --> 09:27.332
And then another workout
with the horses.

09:27.334 --> 09:28.867
Thank you so much for dinner.

09:28.869 --> 09:30.735
- We have an extra room if
you would like to stay there.

09:30.870 --> 09:33.871
- Oh! Um, no, no, no,
I'm used to life on the road,

09:33.907 --> 09:35.874
So I have a very comfortable
setup in my trailer.

really feel

09:46.820 --> 09:49.020
About the preschool prep camp
I went to all the trouble

09:49.155 --> 09:51.156
Of finding out about.

09:51.158 --> 09:54.558
- Well, you're probably right.

09:54.595 --> 09:56.694
It'll be good for both of us.

09:56.763 --> 09:59.497
And, I'm gonna be busy
working with sylvie,

09:59.633 --> 10:01.465
So the timing is good.
- See?

10:03.303 --> 10:05.536
- I think that she took
the job I turned down.

10:06.840 --> 10:09.974
(small laugh) I would be
travelling the world,

10:10.043 --> 10:12.644
Hanging out with famous people
if I had've accepted

10:12.779 --> 10:14.646

10:15.816 --> 10:17.949

10:18.084 --> 10:20.151
- No. Not at all.

10:22.322 --> 10:24.922
Ten years ago,
working with renard,

10:24.958 --> 10:27.125
And those liberty horses,

10:27.194 --> 10:28.993
That was my dream.

10:29.029 --> 10:30.662
(sighs)

10:30.797 --> 10:32.597
- Well, I get that.

10:32.599 --> 10:34.632
I've had my own dreams
that slipped away.

10:34.701 --> 10:37.001
Mitch is selling aspen grove

10:37.004 --> 10:38.737
And his herd,

10:38.739 --> 10:40.138
And he didn't even tell me.

10:40.140 --> 10:42.106
- Yeah, but you guys broke up
six months ago, why would he?

10:42.242 --> 10:43.941
- Well, we still talk
sometimes, I mean,

10:44.011 --> 10:46.144
You'd think he would've told me
something like that.

10:46.146 --> 10:49.214
I mean, it's pretty...
Life-changing. (sighs)

10:49.349 --> 10:51.515
I just, I don't understand
men at all.

10:52.653 --> 10:54.552
- And peter?

10:54.621 --> 10:56.353
Have you talked to him lately?

10:56.390 --> 10:58.289
- Yeah, I talk to him
all the time.

10:58.291 --> 11:01.292
- Yeah, but he still hasn't
mentioned that weird

11:01.361 --> 11:04.095
Late night phone call that
you said changed everything?

11:04.230 --> 11:06.264
- It's like it never happened.

11:06.399 --> 11:08.299
I mean, we talk
about everything,

11:08.335 --> 11:11.102
We talk about kids, work,

11:11.104 --> 11:13.137
Everything else in the world
except that.

11:14.307 --> 11:15.973
The most important thing.

11:15.975 --> 11:17.742
- Why don't you bring it up?

11:19.046 --> 11:20.979
- No. No, I can't.

11:21.114 --> 11:22.914
I can't let peter think
that he's the reason

11:23.049 --> 11:24.849
I broke things off with mitch.

11:24.851 --> 11:26.751
- (sighs)

11:26.886 --> 11:29.387
- (pensive sigh)
anyway, your birthday.

11:29.456 --> 11:31.122
- No, no, no, no.
- It's comin' up.

11:31.257 --> 11:32.891
Do you want to do
something special?

11:32.893 --> 11:34.992
- I'd rather just forget
about it, to be honest.

11:35.062 --> 11:36.727
- Amy.

11:36.729 --> 11:39.530

birthdays, but...

than that.

the dude ranch for a while.

in the morning to clean it up,

17:20.607 --> 17:22.473

the towels, and the...

19:36.743 --> 19:38.876

started after six months?

19:38.945 --> 19:42.413

that business I mentioned.

19:42.415 --> 19:44.215
And there's a bit
of a deadline.

19:44.284 --> 19:46.817

I haven't missed.

19:46.819 --> 19:49.553
Deadlines.
- Okay, I'll make it fast.

19:49.622 --> 19:52.957
Mitch wants to sell his herd.
Fred wants us to buy it.

19:52.959 --> 19:54.292
We have to let him know today,

19:54.294 --> 19:56.360
Because there's somebody else
interested.

19:56.362 --> 19:58.062
- That's easy.

19:58.064 --> 19:59.630
I'm not interested in buying
any more cattle.

19:59.632 --> 20:02.099
Mitch's or anyone else's.
- Since when?!

20:02.168 --> 20:04.502
You used to beg me
to expand our herd!

20:04.637 --> 20:06.103
- Well, I've changed,
you know?

20:06.239 --> 20:08.038

And it's time I started
living it.

41:23.348 --> 41:24.881
Mitch is leaving,

41:24.883 --> 41:26.549
He's getting on with his life,

41:26.685 --> 41:29.085
And I need to do the same,
right?

41:29.154 --> 41:30.920
And if it's not gonna be
with peter, either,

41:30.922 --> 41:32.388
Then...

41:32.457 --> 41:34.958
I just have to deal with that.

41:35.093 --> 41:37.426
It's time I learn to be
on my own.

41:38.796 --> 41:40.597
Oh! You think I would've
figured that out by now.

41:40.599 --> 41:43.332
- Hey, don't be so hard
on yourself.

41:43.401 --> 41:44.800
I learn from you every day.

41:44.802 --> 41:48.071
- Yeah, things not to do.
- No, lou... (laughs)

41:48.206 --> 41:50.273
Yeah, maybe sometimes.
- (huffs)

41:50.342 --> 41:52.475
- But you were right
about the camp.

41:52.477 --> 41:54.877
Lyndy loves it.
And it...

41:54.913 --> 41:57.246
It has helped me
to let go, too.

41:58.617 --> 42:00.550
- It's so hard to let go.

42:02.420 --> 42:04.354
- Yeah, I know.

42:04.356 --> 42:06.055
- Of course you do.

42:07.125 --> 42:08.758
