I can tell, Chels. I can tell.
'Cause, you know,

02:30.108 --> 02:32.486
the key ingredient
to eggnog is egg,

I'm sorry you're disappointed.
But just because

20:02.660 --> 20:03.953
your Dad and I
aren't together,

20:03.953 --> 20:05.496
doesn't mean that
we're not still a family.

20:05.496 --> 20:08.040
I guess just
seeing the kinara

20:08.040 --> 20:10.459
and all those old
family photos just...

20:10.459 --> 20:12.962
made me think about
how things used to be.

20:12.962 --> 20:15.256
Yeah, even I thought
Booker's vision
was gonna come true

20:15.256 --> 20:17.675
when Dad said he was off
to buy Mom something shiny.

20:17.675 --> 20:20.010
Ooh, you were gonna
buy me something shiny?
Give it to me!

20:21.887 --> 20:24.265
So I said "something shiny"
and you both assumed
I meant a ring?

20:24.265 --> 20:27.518
No, no, no. A bracelet,
or earring, you know.

20:27.518 --> 20:29.812
Or a tiara.
Ooh, I, I look good
in a tiara.

20:29.812 --> 20:31.731
Rae, it's not the time.

20:33.232 --> 20:35.109
(exhales)
Listen, kids.

20:35.109 --> 20:37.862
I know it's
the holiday season,

20:37.862 --> 20:39.780
and we're all looking for
that Christmas miracle,

20:39.780 --> 20:43.075
but us being together
is a miracle in itself.

20:43.075 --> 20:45.911
‐Ooh, that's true, Rae.
It's like a zero‐degree miracle.
‐Yeah.

20:45.911 --> 20:48.080
Yeah. Yeah,
it is freezing.

20:48.080 --> 20:49.206
Oh, you're freezing?

20:49.206 --> 20:51.375
You'd be out here
without a coat
if it weren't for me.

20:51.375 --> 20:53.836
‐Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I owe you one.
‐Eh.

20:53.836 --> 20:56.338
This one's on the house.
It's Christmas.

20:56.338 --> 20:58.048
Also, your gift
hasn't arrived yet.

20:58.048 --> 20:59.383
Also, I didn't order it.

20:59.383 --> 21:01.552
Also, I don't have any money.

‐Dang it!
‐Dang it!

21:30.706 --> 21:32.958
No, you guys.
It's like you didn't
know what I wanted,

21:32.958 --> 21:35.085
but you knew where
I'd get it from.
Thank you so much.

‐Oh. Yeah.
‐Hmm.

21:38.756 --> 21:40.716
Merry Christmas, Raven.

21:41.509 --> 21:44.178
I'm sorry for screwing
things up in the kitchen.

21:44.178 --> 21:46.597
But now I know how much
your recipe cards mean to you,

21:46.597 --> 21:49.475
so I wanted to get you something
that would keep them safe.

21:49.475 --> 21:52.311
Like how you kept
my family safe
while I was away.

Oh, I love it so much!
Thank you!

no name on it.

just an empty box.

Just open it now.

give it a test run,

23:12.975 --> 23:16.186

it's very easy to break.

Wait, so you broke it
before we did?
