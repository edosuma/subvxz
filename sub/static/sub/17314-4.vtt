CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

00:18.840 --> 00:21.000
Thank you very much!

00:21.000 --> 00:23.240
Hello and welcome. Thank you.

00:25.840 --> 00:33.240
Now, we start tonight
with a question we've borrowed from
Radio 4. Can a car ever be art?

00:33.240 --> 00:37.160
Most experts on the subject say no,
but then most experts haven't

00:37.160 --> 00:40.560
clapped eyes
on Alfa Romeo's latest creation.

00:42.160 --> 00:48.640
It's called the 8C
and I think it's quite simply
the best-looking car ever made.

00:52.240 --> 00:53.760
It's not dramatic.

00:57.120 --> 00:58.640
It's not ground-breaking.

00:58.640 --> 01:02.200
From some angles,
it's not even desperately pretty.

01:04.560 --> 01:10.320
As Francis Bacon once said, there is
no beauty that hath not some
strangeness about its proportions.

01:10.320 --> 01:12.920
And he's right, whoever he is.

01:12.920 --> 01:17.640
Look at Keira Knightley, she's just
an ironing board with a face,
and she works.

01:17.640 --> 01:19.560
So does this.

01:19.560 --> 01:26.720
With its long nose and short
tail, it's as classically
correct as a Ferrari Daytona,

01:26.720 --> 01:29.160
or a Georgian's house.

01:33.120 --> 01:36.680
You probably expect the noise
it makes to be classical too,

01:36.680 --> 01:43.320
like a cello being played by an
angel in a pillow of honey. No.

01:43.320 --> 01:45.200
ENGINE REVS

01:49.240 --> 01:55.360
Sadly, only 500 8Cs
have been made, so it's very
unlikely you'll ever see one.

01:55.360 --> 01:59.960
But if one passes within
20 miles, trust me, you'll hear it.

02:04.720 --> 02:07.200
ENGINE REVS

02:07.200 --> 02:10.160
Some cars have tuned exhausts,

02:10.160 --> 02:13.800
so the noise they make
is as fake as a hooker's smile.

02:15.600 --> 02:18.880
But this sounds real.
This sounds fantastic.

02:22.320 --> 02:24.120
Listen to it on the overrun...

02:24.120 --> 02:26.400
ENGINE ROARS

02:26.400 --> 02:28.760
Ha-ha!

02:31.800 --> 02:34.640
So, it looks gorgeous
and it sounds amazing.

02:34.640 --> 02:38.640
And on top of that,
it's an Alfa Romeo.

02:40.280 --> 02:46.960
If I can liken the whole global
car industry to the human
body, Toyota is the brain,

02:46.960 --> 02:50.840
Aston Martin is the face,
Cadillac is the stomach.

02:50.840 --> 02:55.560
And Alfa Romeo,
as we discovered last week,
that's the heart and soul.

03:01.520 --> 03:05.960
So, what is it, then,
this £110,000 car?

03:05.960 --> 03:13.840
Well, at the front,
there's a 450 horse power 4.7
litre version of Maserati's V8.

03:15.920 --> 03:20.120
The gearbox, in true Alpha
tradition, is at the back.

03:20.120 --> 03:23.320
The Ferrari seats are carbon fibre.

03:23.320 --> 03:29.280
Most of the car, in fact,
is carbon fibre, so it weighs
less than a Mitsubishi Evo.

03:29.280 --> 03:33.240
You might imagine, then,
that it's very fast.

03:38.120 --> 03:44.360
They say it'll get from 0-60
in 4.2 seconds and that
its top speed...

03:44.360 --> 03:46.720
ENGINE ROARS

03:46.720 --> 03:48.480
..is 182

03:49.080 --> 03:52.680
I think they could have made it
faster than that.

03:54.440 --> 03:59.960
But then it would have been faster
than a Ferrari, and in Italy,
that's a bit of a social no-no.

03:59.960 --> 04:03.800
That would be like
vomiting on the Pope. Sorry.

04:07.320 --> 04:08.680
What about the handling?

04:08.680 --> 04:13.720
It should be good. The weight
distribution is bang on,
there's a low centre of gravity...

04:13.720 --> 04:16.680
it's even got a limited slip diff.

04:18.079 --> 04:22.280
Add all this together and the
overall result is...terrible.

04:26.720 --> 04:30.080
TYRES SCREECH

04:30.520 --> 04:36.520
The steering feel's wooden.
And the suspension... It feels
like it's made from old tea bags.

04:40.880 --> 04:43.480
Here's some sacrilege.
It feels like a Mustang.

04:45.760 --> 04:47.880
There's the
flappy puddle gearbox.

04:47.880 --> 04:51.960
I don't like any of them, but
this one really is a bit ESN.

04:53.760 --> 04:55.160
And the worse thing?

04:55.160 --> 05:00.560
You're driving along and
your foot gets jammed
underneath the brake pedal.

05:00.560 --> 05:03.880
TYRES SCREECH

05:13.880 --> 05:17.080
I don't really care about
any of these things, because

05:17.080 --> 05:23.240
buying this car
for its dynamic abilities is like
buying a porn film for its plot.

05:27.000 --> 05:31.880
I don't care, either, that
it has a ridiculous boot.

05:31.880 --> 05:37.480
Or that it has no back seats,
or that the steering
wheel's in the wrong place.

05:37.480 --> 05:43.560
I wouldn't care if the seats had
spikes in them and the sat nav had
Tourette's.

05:51.240 --> 05:53.480
I don't even care about the price.

05:53.480 --> 06:00.360
I mean, somebody recently
paid £17.2 million for this
fat woman on a sofa.

06:00.360 --> 06:02.040
And which would you rather?

06:03.680 --> 06:08.440
153 of those,
or an enormous cleaning lady?

06:12.280 --> 06:15.760
A man from the Tate Gallery told me
the other day that a car can never

06:15.760 --> 06:23.080
be art because, for something to
be art, it can have no purpose
other than itself, no function.

06:27.880 --> 06:35.040
Well, look at this.
It doesn't drive very well,
it's not been built with much care,

06:35.040 --> 06:39.440
and it is hopelessly impractical.

06:41.360 --> 06:45.320
What Alfa has built, then, is
not a car, it's a centrefold.

06:45.320 --> 06:50.720
What Alfa has built is
14 feet of art.

06:50.720 --> 06:53.040
ENGINE ROARS

06:56.240 --> 06:58.240
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

07:00.640 --> 07:02.680
Look at that, James!

07:02.680 --> 07:04.560
I have to admit, you're right.

07:04.560 --> 07:09.240
It does work better as a poster.
It's like the Lamborghini Countach.
This should be

07:09.240 --> 07:13.080
supplied with four pieces of
blu-tak on it so you can stick
it to the wall.

07:13.080 --> 07:17.840
Anyway, we must now find out how
fast it goes round our track.

07:17.840 --> 07:21.680
And that, of course, means handing
it over to our racing driver.

07:21.680 --> 07:27.400
Some say his droppings have
been found as far north as York,

07:27.400 --> 07:33.320
and he has a full-sized
tattoo of his face on his face.

07:33.320 --> 07:36.360
All we know is he's called The Stig.

07:36.360 --> 07:41.280
And he's off. Global warming
means it's superwet out there today.

07:41.280 --> 07:43.520
The poster's going
to get very soggy.

07:43.520 --> 07:46.600
Very gingerly into the first corner.

07:48.200 --> 07:51.200
Back-end, is that lurching
a bit? Looks like it is.

07:51.200 --> 07:53.360
But the Stig's got it under control.

07:53.360 --> 07:57.040
# I can see that
you're waving goodbye... #

07:58.760 --> 08:00.960
The Stig's still still loving
Daniel.

08:00.960 --> 08:04.280
Surprised the Daily Mail
haven't picked up on that.

08:04.280 --> 08:08.080
Very sideways coming out of Chicago.
Coming up to Hammerhead now.

08:08.080 --> 08:11.120
This could be quite understeery
in this weather.

08:11.120 --> 08:15.440
Nope. The Stig has used a hoof
full of throttle to cure that.

08:15.440 --> 08:18.040
Look at that driving...
impressive stuff!

08:19.600 --> 08:22.440
# It looks like Daniel... #

08:25.200 --> 08:26.680
Now the follow-through.

08:26.680 --> 08:29.320
Can he open it up here?

08:29.320 --> 08:32.520
On this lake where the
track used to be...
There's the tyres.

08:32.520 --> 08:35.200
Finally he gets there.

08:35.200 --> 08:39.480
And opening it up now on the
main straight towards the
two corners left.

08:39.480 --> 08:43.120
Very twitchy. Stig earning his
raw pork treats today.

08:43.120 --> 08:46.840
He's going through, all over the
shop. And across the line!

08:46.840 --> 08:51.080
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

08:52.200 --> 08:54.800
Bit of a clue here how well it did.

08:54.800 --> 08:56.240
If we look here,

08:58.040 --> 09:05.320
in similar conditions, the Mercedes
SL55 did a 133.2 The Alfa - 138.2.

09:05.320 --> 09:11.800
That's one of the slowest cars
we've ever put round there.

09:11.800 --> 09:18.320
But think of it this way, as posters
go, it is is quicker than that
tennis girl scratching her arse.

09:18.320 --> 09:21.400
Right, the news. Now,
we were sent a picture this week of

09:21.400 --> 09:25.240
a biker caught in Holland,
I think it was, doing 137kmh.

09:25.240 --> 09:27.640
Well, here's the picture.

09:27.640 --> 09:31.440
It kind of tells its own story.
There's one key thing there.
He's not on it.

09:31.440 --> 09:39.320
Interestingly, he wasn't prosecuted
because he claimed he wasn't riding
the bike at the time of the offence.

09:39.320 --> 09:43.240
What did he claim? Probably said he
was washing it and it fell over.

09:43.240 --> 09:47.600
And it slipped and accelerated
and kept building speed.

09:47.600 --> 09:49.800
There's a Top Gear top
tip here.

09:49.800 --> 09:54.760
If you're driving along,
see a speed camera, no chance
of slowing down, leap out.

09:54.760 --> 09:58.880
Don't do that if
you're a coach driver!

09:58.880 --> 10:05.200
No. Now, as you know, we get
quite a few letters of complaint
on Top Gear.

10:05.200 --> 10:08.080
A lot are from communists and
hippies, so we ignore them.

10:08.080 --> 10:10.160
LAUGHTER

10:10.160 --> 10:13.880
Anyway, last week,
we thought nobody would be watching

10:13.880 --> 10:18.320
because that epic tennis match
was on, which we were all watching!

10:18.320 --> 10:24.560
It turns out
one person was watching Top Gear,
and boy, is he an eagle-eyed chap.

10:24.560 --> 10:30.800
Eagle-eyed chap isn't what you
said when his letter arrived!
I called him something fruitier.

10:30.800 --> 10:35.160
He says he was
watching the show when I was driving
an Alfa Romeo along the road.

10:35.160 --> 10:40.960
He says, and he's complained to
the police, that I clipped
a double white line.

10:40.960 --> 10:42.440
Well, here's the footage.

10:48.080 --> 10:53.760
That bloke should have been
at Wimbledon with those crossing
the white line spotting skills.

10:53.760 --> 10:55.680
It appears
I'm banged to rights and

10:55.680 --> 11:01.440
I think apologies where apologies
are necessary, I'm very sorry.

11:01.440 --> 11:04.400
I shouldn't have done it.
I'm normally fastidious.

11:04.400 --> 11:07.080
But a mistake.
Good job I'm not a brain surgeon!

11:07.080 --> 11:08.760
LAUGHTER

11:08.760 --> 11:11.760
Now, are there any mothers here?

11:11.760 --> 11:16.840
Yes. Well, Fiat has decided you
need patronising. So, they've come
up with

11:16.840 --> 11:20.720
a limited edition version of the
Panda. We've got a picture of it.

11:20.720 --> 11:23.200
Why is it for mothers?

11:23.200 --> 11:25.800
It's called the Panda Mammi.
I'm not joking.

11:25.800 --> 11:27.400
LAUGHTER

11:27.400 --> 11:32.360
And they've given it an orange
interior and a purple exterior
to match your varicose veins.

11:32.360 --> 11:36.360
And a really big
boot that it's embarrassed about.

11:36.360 --> 11:42.160
And it's air bags are two feet
lower down...on a normal model.

11:42.560 --> 11:45.600
What will they do next?
A "Fiat recently divorced father"

11:45.600 --> 11:49.640
with a sat nav that only goes to
the zoo?

11:49.640 --> 11:51.200
That's a good idea, actually.

11:51.200 --> 11:54.880
I've got a Fiat Panda and a nephew
and niece, so they could bring out

11:54.880 --> 12:02.160
the Panda Unsuitable Uncle, which has
just got a very sharp kitchen
knife left lying around.

12:02.160 --> 12:07.000
I went on the internet this week,
and I found this.

12:07.000 --> 12:10.240
GROANS

12:10.240 --> 12:13.280
It is just pure pornography.

12:13.280 --> 12:16.760
Look at it. It's filth!

12:16.760 --> 12:22.000
That is a convertible version
of the Alfa Romeo HC that I
was driving a few minutes ago.

12:22.000 --> 12:24.640
That is gorgeous, though, isn't it?

12:24.640 --> 12:28.360
Great news! What? The Dacia
Sandero, I've got a new picture!

12:31.400 --> 12:35.160
Anyway, I think we've had more
signpost sent in this week.

12:35.160 --> 12:38.560
We're having this campaign
to get rid of
unnecessary signposts.

12:38.560 --> 12:43.760
Imagine if you're driving along,
thinking "These roadworks ahead
look really complicated.

12:43.760 --> 12:46.720
"I hope they put signs up
to simplify it all for me"

12:46.720 --> 12:49.120
Well, they have. There you go.

12:49.120 --> 12:51.760
That's made it a lot easier.
What is...?

12:51.760 --> 12:55.240
My particular favourite
from the week is this one.

12:55.240 --> 12:58.520
LAUGHTER

12:58.520 --> 13:00.520
As opposed to gradual gunfire!

13:02.120 --> 13:05.440
Here's mine.

13:09.840 --> 13:15.000
Some bloke nailed that to the post,
stood back and said, "Yes. I don't
see anything wrong with that."

13:15.000 --> 13:18.320
It could be in the other direction.
I see what you mean!

13:21.400 --> 13:27.040
Anyway, Boris Johnson, has announced
this week that the London congestion
charge will not,

13:27.040 --> 13:32.160
as Ken Livingstone
suggested, be going up to £25 a day,
he's keeping it at eight.

13:32.160 --> 13:34.360
APPLAUSE

13:34.360 --> 13:36.960
Boris has got a round of applause.

13:36.960 --> 13:41.600
However, in the interests of
political balance, I do have a
complaint about Boris because

13:41.600 --> 13:46.760
he said when he was
campaigning that he was going to get
rid of the bendy buses.

13:46.760 --> 13:51.360
Well, what's the delay?
Hang on, give him a chance. How
long's he been in office now?

13:51.360 --> 13:54.960
Two months. Two months? Time me.

13:54.960 --> 13:58.400
Right, we've got a phone. Hang on...

13:58.400 --> 14:00.320
Ready, Go! Is that Reg Varney?

14:00.320 --> 14:04.480
You know those big long buses
with elastic in the middle,
get them off the road.

14:04.480 --> 14:08.120
Don't send them out ever again. Sell
them to the Belgians or someone.

14:08.120 --> 14:09.640
Was that two months?

14:09.640 --> 14:11.920
Eight seconds.

14:11.920 --> 14:13.920
Come on, Boris, hurry up!

14:13.920 --> 14:17.920
That's sorted that one out. Good.
Hey, Audi's bought a photocopier.

14:17.920 --> 14:19.520
No!

14:19.520 --> 14:23.000
Yes. Bear with me,
it's a really good one.

14:23.000 --> 14:27.360
They put the
Q7, the big huge thing they've got,
they put that through their new

14:27.360 --> 14:34.200
photocopier at 75% and made this,
the Q5, which is a whole new Audi,
you see. It's just exactly the same!

14:34.200 --> 14:36.080
It really is.

14:36.080 --> 14:38.760
Seriously, is that a new car?
This one is the new one,

14:38.760 --> 14:44.320
about 75% the size of that one. Have
your mum and dad got a photocopier?

14:44.320 --> 14:47.840
LAUGHTER

14:47.840 --> 14:51.360
Yes, and it was stuck at 60%! 60!

14:51.360 --> 14:54.000
Yes, all right. Moving on.

14:54.000 --> 14:57.800
I want to talk about the new Ferrari
California. Here it is.

14:57.800 --> 15:03.680
And that, I think, is the first
Ferrari ever with a front-mounted V8.

15:03.680 --> 15:06.240
You think? You don't want
to say that in public.

15:06.240 --> 15:10.560
(IN A NASAL ACCENT) You'll have the
Ferrari owners' club coming
round your house.

15:10.560 --> 15:17.640
"Mr so-called celebrity
so-called May. Surely you
remember the B3684/B from 1956?"

15:17.640 --> 15:21.280
Ooh, they're an adenoidal
bunch of angry young men.

15:21.280 --> 15:24.160
Mostly angry because they
haven't got Ferraris.

15:24.160 --> 15:27.720
"I've got a
polo shirt with Ferrari on it."

15:27.720 --> 15:33.560
No, I'm going to say that that is
the first Ferrari in the company's
history with a front-mounted V8.

15:33.560 --> 15:37.600
That's brave, a brave thing to say.
I'm going to say
something else brave.

15:37.600 --> 15:40.920
That's not very good looking. You're
right. It isn't, is it?

15:40.920 --> 15:46.000
there hasn't been a good
looking Ferrari since the 355.

15:46.000 --> 15:51.720
We think they're good looking
because they're Ferraris, but
they're not. It's like...

15:51.720 --> 15:54.720
Who's that girl in Sex And The City?

15:54.720 --> 15:58.480
Sarah Jessica Parker.
We all go, "She must be pretty."

15:58.480 --> 16:01.200
She looks like a boiled horse!

16:01.200 --> 16:04.520
LAUGHTER

16:04.520 --> 16:10.680
Right, that's the end of the news.
Wait. Check my flies. You know how
eagle-eyed our viewers are.

16:10.680 --> 16:12.720
They're not that eagle-eyed. What?

16:12.720 --> 16:14.600
Not that eagle-eyed.

16:14.600 --> 16:17.960
APPLAUSE

16:18.800 --> 16:22.120
This is a Datsun 120Y.

16:22.120 --> 16:26.320
The company that created it has
now brought out a follow-up model.

16:26.320 --> 16:31.080
It's not coming to Britain till
next year but the follow-up to
this, I couldn't wait.

16:31.080 --> 16:35.320
So last month, I went all the
way to Japan to try it there.

16:45.560 --> 16:47.680
This is what I've come to see.

16:47.680 --> 16:51.480
The 193mph Nissan GTR.

16:53.480 --> 16:57.160
It's a very far cry
from the old 120Y.

16:58.760 --> 17:02.080
Its engine is made in
a hermetically sealed lab to ensure

17:02.080 --> 17:07.800
the components don't microscopically
expand while it's being assembled.

17:10.000 --> 17:15.200
Its tyres are filled with
pure nitrogen, because normal air
is considered too unstable.

17:15.200 --> 17:19.400
No-one has ever made
a car this way before.

17:19.400 --> 17:24.760
The world's motoring press
is hailing it as the
prow of the good ship progress.

17:24.760 --> 17:30.160
A £53,000 turbocharged
four-wheel-drive rocket ship which

17:30.160 --> 17:35.200
redefines the way we think
about automotive speed.

17:35.200 --> 17:41.920
Plainly, the best way for us
to test this incredible car
is for one of our Top Gear races.

17:41.920 --> 17:46.480
But to do that, my colleagues would
have had to come out here as well.

17:46.480 --> 17:48.200
Here's what we've got in store.

17:48.200 --> 17:51.760
A race starting here, were we
are now on the western seaboard,

17:51.760 --> 17:56.280
right across Japan, that's
400 miles, to a mountain here.

17:56.280 --> 17:57.720
At...Noko...

18:00.800 --> 18:04.240
..There. Where there is a statue to
the Buddha of road safety.

18:04.240 --> 18:08.920
Yes. We're going to be using
the most efficient public-transport
network in the world.

18:08.920 --> 18:13.200
And most of the time, we're going
to be on the 200mph bullet train.

18:13.200 --> 18:15.520
Very nice, bullet train.

18:15.520 --> 18:19.320
Great. And I'm going to be
taking them on in the GTR.

18:19.320 --> 18:21.480
Yes, on roads with
a 60mph speed limit.

18:21.480 --> 18:24.520
Where there's a policeman
every 200 yards.

18:24.520 --> 18:29.400
And you're going to have
to drive through Tokyo, which is
the most congested city on earth.

18:29.400 --> 18:31.080
A piece of cake.
You've had it.

18:32.720 --> 18:39.080
And so, at precisely 11
minutes past eight in the
morning, the race began.

18:44.200 --> 18:46.240
Look at them.
They look like ramblers.

18:48.280 --> 18:54.240
We now had 25 minutes to get
into town, find the station
and catch our first train.

18:56.760 --> 18:58.880
They have so many
connections to make,

18:58.880 --> 19:04.960
so many forms of transport to go on,
the chances of them making it
without a single mistake are nil.

19:04.960 --> 19:07.040
If they do make a mistake,
that's it.

19:07.040 --> 19:10.640
Have you seen these manhole covers?
No. They're fantastic.

19:10.640 --> 19:17.080
A boy from Birmingham and a man with
no sense of direction, in Japan
won't win. The end.

19:19.640 --> 19:24.640
Here we go. You don't know what that
says! But there's a red dot.
That must mean, "You Are Here."

19:24.640 --> 19:26.680
Look, the ice-skating man

19:26.680 --> 19:29.880
with the picnic table.

19:29.880 --> 19:34.400
That's a man on skis
playing a harp next to it which
probably doesn't mean train station.

19:36.120 --> 19:39.840
I want to adjust the
scale on the sat nav.

19:39.840 --> 19:42.280
But it's all in Japanese.

19:43.920 --> 19:47.520
I daren't touch it in
case at all just goes off
and then I'd be doomed.

19:50.280 --> 19:52.680
Konichiwa. The station?

19:52.680 --> 19:55.240
THEY IMITATE A TRAIN

19:55.240 --> 19:58.360
The thing is, you see,
all Japanese cars...

19:58.360 --> 20:01.360
SAT NAV SPEAKS IN JAPANESE

20:03.680 --> 20:04.760
Help!

20:04.760 --> 20:07.960
'To deal with the language
problems, we'd all been given

20:07.960 --> 20:12.600
'speaking translator machines and
at the station, we fired ours up.'

20:14.360 --> 20:16.040
Ticket...

20:18.320 --> 20:20.080
This isn't going to take long(!)

20:21.760 --> 20:24.440
He knows you want a ticket.
It's a ticket office.

20:24.440 --> 20:27.240
Good point. He won't think
you're asking for shoes.

20:27.240 --> 20:29.840
MACHINE SPEAKS JAPANESE

20:29.840 --> 20:35.440
Sorry, that's wrong. That was, "Is
this seat taken?" How do I go back?
It can't be difficult. Sorry.

20:37.400 --> 20:39.440
The road has opened up. Here we go.

20:44.320 --> 20:47.040
Don't try and match the symbols.
I know you are.

20:51.720 --> 20:54.440
OK, I've got a 3.8 litre,

20:54.440 --> 20:57.680
twin turbocharged V6 engine,
which produces...

20:58.840 --> 21:03.840
Actually, I've got no idea
how much horsepower
because each one is handmade.

21:06.160 --> 21:10.560
Nissan say it's around 470 brake
horsepower but an American magazine

21:10.560 --> 21:14.400
and it was producing 507 horsepower.

21:17.640 --> 21:20.920
Morning. It's like being
in a black-and-white film.

21:20.920 --> 21:22.120
Morning.

21:23.680 --> 21:30.520
But the best thing about it
is that each gear box is tailored
to work with a specific engine.

21:30.520 --> 21:34.040
This one wouldn't work
in any other GTR.

21:34.040 --> 21:36.680
Not even NASA do that
with the Space Shuttle.

21:39.680 --> 21:42.880
They're not just hanging around.
Look, there's a line.

21:42.880 --> 21:45.600
You have to walk
through the lines onto the train.

21:45.600 --> 21:48.000
What a brilliant looking train.

21:49.000 --> 21:51.800
OK, here we go.
The motorway network.

21:51.800 --> 21:53.920
Now we can be a bullet car!

21:58.440 --> 22:01.200
The Datsun would cross Japan
by motorway,

22:01.200 --> 22:03.040
go through the centre of Tokyo,

22:03.040 --> 22:06.920
under Tokyo Bay and up
a mountain road to the finish line.

22:06.920 --> 22:12.000
We would take four trains and a bus
to the bay, cross it on a ferry,

22:12.000 --> 22:15.400
and then get to the finish
on a cable car.

22:15.400 --> 22:22.080
Our route
was almost 150 miles longer,
but we would have no jams or delays.

22:25.680 --> 22:30.000
87% of normal trains
in Japan are on time.

22:30.000 --> 22:34.600
But, for them,
being late is anything
over a minute behind time.

22:34.600 --> 22:36.800
So that's a late train,
if it's a minute.

22:36.800 --> 22:40.720
But in the UK, to be late, it's
got to be over ten minutes late.

22:40.720 --> 22:43.400
And if trains are late,

22:43.400 --> 22:45.720
you get a free rail journey.

22:45.720 --> 22:50.920
So if this is late, we don't pay,
and we get a pass that explains
to your employer why you're late!

22:52.400 --> 22:54.080
He's had it.

22:57.280 --> 23:01.400
There are a lot of speed cameras on
the motorways but they put signs up

23:01.400 --> 23:05.520
saying "It's in 300 metres, 200
metres, 100 metres, there it is."

23:05.520 --> 23:08.640
The only trouble is
the signs are all in Japanese.

23:08.640 --> 23:12.440
'However, I'd come up
with a cunning plan.'

23:12.440 --> 23:15.880
In Japan, a simple photograph
of the number plate isn't enough.

23:15.880 --> 23:19.720
They have to also have a photograph
of the face to know who was driving.

23:19.720 --> 23:23.520
So what I've done,
is I've made this.

23:23.520 --> 23:25.720
It's a Bill Oddie face mask.

23:25.720 --> 23:29.400
So he's going to be sitting
in a badger hole somewhere,

23:29.400 --> 23:34.160
and he's going to be collecting
points in Japan on his licence.

23:36.520 --> 23:38.160
PHONE RINGS

23:38.160 --> 23:39.560
Hammond. 'Yes?'

23:39.560 --> 23:41.400
'Was your train late?'

23:41.400 --> 23:44.800
'No! Nothing's late.
It left to the second'

23:44.800 --> 23:48.160
on time. You've had it.
We're going. We're on the way.

MAN SPEAKS JAPANESE

23:51.200 --> 23:55.680
We're being shouted at. Hang on mate,
there's a man shouting at me. What?

23:58.600 --> 24:00.480
Mate, I've gotta go, I've gotta go.

24:00.480 --> 24:03.600
I like it when there's an
emergency like that in his voice.

24:03.600 --> 24:06.080
You know something's gone wrong
in his world.

24:06.080 --> 24:08.680
It might be rude to use
the telephone in the train.

24:11.160 --> 24:16.560
'Unable to talk to my rivals,
I started to fiddle
with the GTR's buttons.'

24:16.560 --> 24:19.760
All the graphics on the system
were done by the same company

24:19.760 --> 24:23.120
that does the graphics for the
Gran Turismo PlayStation game.

24:23.120 --> 24:25.200
This is amazing.

24:26.880 --> 24:30.880
Engine oil temperature,
water temperature,
engine oil pressure, boost!

24:30.880 --> 24:35.880
And that one gives me
my acceleration and braking in G.

24:35.880 --> 24:38.160
Steering G. There it is.

MACHINE SPEAKS JAPANESE,

24:52.360 --> 24:57.600
I can't understand the answers.
Exactly, it's pointless.
That's the problem.

24:57.600 --> 24:59.960
Two fried eggs,
that's not what I want.

25:00.520 --> 25:03.280
I do that. Oh yeah, that was...

25:05.840 --> 25:14.320
"Sorry officer, I was trying to
get half a G while changing lane."

25:14.320 --> 25:15.800
There we are.

25:21.960 --> 25:26.440
As James and Richard
trundle towards Kyoto,

25:26.440 --> 25:29.400
I was hurtling up

25:29.400 --> 25:31.840
Or was I?

25:36.960 --> 25:38.800
I'm definitely in Switzerland.

25:38.800 --> 25:43.400
I've gone wrong. Somehow, I've gone
through North Korea, Russia, Poland,

25:43.400 --> 25:46.880
Germany, and I'm in Switzerland.
How have I done that?

25:48.880 --> 25:51.960
'The mountains were staggering,
but I couldn't look

25:51.960 --> 25:55.840
'because the Japanese had tunnelled
through every single one of them.'

26:04.680 --> 26:09.120
Finally, I'm out of the tunnel.

26:09.120 --> 26:12.000
Sunlight! It's gone again.

26:13.600 --> 26:14.840
Two hours into the race

26:14.840 --> 26:17.000
and our train, bang on time,

26:17.000 --> 26:19.960
was already
two-thirds of the way to Kyoto.

26:19.960 --> 26:24.160
For Jeremy, however,
things weren't going so smoothly.

26:24.160 --> 26:27.680
Hello? 'Get out of the way man.'

26:27.680 --> 26:31.560
Come on! Come on!

26:31.560 --> 26:34.360
What are you doing?
You're in a traffic jam?

26:34.360 --> 26:37.720
'Hammond, there's
a man driving at 9mph!'

26:37.720 --> 26:40.840
There's no one wonder
China's going to overtake you

26:40.840 --> 26:44.440
as the dominant industrial power
if you drive at that speed!

26:44.440 --> 26:46.720
BEEPING
Hello?

26:47.640 --> 26:52.160
Don't tell me, it's the biggest drama

It actually is.

'Predicting the traffic
would wind me up,

26:56.360 --> 27:00.560
'the Top Gear office had provided

27:24.080 --> 27:27.600
Mmm... These are crabs.

'Getting a move on, though,
wasn't easy.'

28:00.120 --> 28:02.320
There's a ticket machine. Tickets!

28:02.320 --> 28:05.960
That's it. Destination three. Right.

28:05.960 --> 28:08.760
Now what?! There's millions of them!
I don't know.

28:08.760 --> 28:12.000
I don't know either!
I don't know what any of this means.

28:12.000 --> 28:15.320
This... See the
little Indian fellow on the top?

I don't like any of that.

28:31.120 --> 28:32.600
I won't like those.

28:32.600 --> 28:34.840
Certainly won't like that.

28:38.960 --> 28:43.320
That is just a fish, lightly killed
and then put in a bag.

The marvellous thing is that
Richard Hammond won't be able
to enjoy any of this,

28:48.800 --> 28:53.200

"It's full of bacteria."

Mate, it's all fish.
Yeah, it's good for you.

29:01.360 --> 29:05.520
I don't like fish. Well,
you've come to the wrong country.

29:11.720 --> 29:13.600
Is that it? Yah.

29:13.600 --> 29:17.520

They call it
the duck-billed platypus.

29:17.520 --> 29:21.680

Hello, Jezza, we've just boarded

30:06.360 --> 30:10.280
I don't care how clever
his Datsun is. We're going faster.

30:10.280 --> 30:18.120
God! The average delay
on the one we're on, two years ago -
six seconds.

30:18.120 --> 30:19.880
Six seconds?!

30:19.880 --> 30:22.320
They're electric, obviously,
the trains.

30:22.320 --> 30:26.560
They actually have a motor
in every single carriage
rather than just power cars

30:26.560 --> 30:30.160
to keep the weight distribution even
to reduce wear on the rails.

30:30.160 --> 30:32.600

OK, "Plemium." Premium. "Plemium."

30:44.960 --> 30:50.680
All the way up and as
quickly as possible. OK.

30:50.680 --> 30:53.760
WOMAN SHOUTS IN JAPANESE

30:53.760 --> 30:57.720
I have seen X Factor winners
less cheerful

30:57.720 --> 31:00.560
than all petrol pump
attendants are in Japan.

31:00.560 --> 31:02.240
SHE SPEAKS IN JAPANESE

31:02.240 --> 31:04.400
Look at this! Brrr!

31:04.400 --> 31:06.880
How frightening's that?

31:06.880 --> 31:10.240
He can spot your beaver
from about a mile away.

31:13.560 --> 31:15.120
Good grief!

31:15.120 --> 31:18.720
Show the viewers.
That's where we got on - Kyoto.

31:18.720 --> 31:23.680
And we've been on for
minutes and we're there,
and we're going to where's Tokyo?

31:23.680 --> 31:27.640
There! So, we've gone there
to there in no time at all.

31:28.760 --> 31:34.840
'While the girl gave my GT-R
a thousand-smile service,
I went to buy some more dead fish.'

31:38.840 --> 31:43.040
SAT NAV: 'HIV...'

31:46.920 --> 31:50.520
I was loving Japan.
I was loving the race.

31:50.520 --> 31:55.160
But, weirdly,
I was struggling to love the GT-R.

31:55.160 --> 31:58.920
It's not the gizmos that I find
depressing, like I do in a Ferrari.

31:58.920 --> 32:01.480
They're wrong in a Ferrari
but this is a Nissan.

32:01.480 --> 32:04.480
You expect it to have
yaw sensors and G sensors,

32:04.480 --> 32:06.120
It's Japanese. That's right.

32:07.040 --> 32:11.560
I just wish that at road speeds,
it would occasionally

32:11.560 --> 32:15.760
put its hand down the front of my
trousers and have a little rummage.

32:15.760 --> 32:21.680
It's almost like it finds
a dual carriageway in Japan
just a bit, sort of, easy.

32:23.320 --> 32:25.680
'Nevertheless, it was still a car,

32:25.680 --> 32:30.280
'which means it would easily beat
those two on their Victorian relic.'

32:30.280 --> 32:34.880
Come on, car, I need 5% of your
potential to beat these idiots.

32:46.520 --> 32:50.480
'And, boy, did the car respond!'

32:51.680 --> 32:54.520
PHONE RINGS

32:54.520 --> 32:55.560
Hello?

32:55.560 --> 32:58.440
Mate, can you hear me?
I'm in Tokyo.

32:58.440 --> 33:01.120
No, you're not. 'Oh, yes, I am!'

33:01.120 --> 33:06.120
'I don't believe you.'
Unfortunately, mate, I am in Tokyo.

33:06.120 --> 33:08.040
How the hell have you done that?

33:08.040 --> 33:10.760
'Driving a product of the
21st century,'

33:10.760 --> 33:12.840
not something
from the Middle Ages.

33:12.840 --> 33:14.720
He got cut off.

33:14.720 --> 33:18.080
They will be so depressed by that.

33:18.080 --> 33:22.840
It's the bullet train! Honest
to God, they have been so cocky

33:22.840 --> 33:26.480
and confident that this time they
were going to win, and they're not!

33:28.760 --> 33:31.440
'We were down but not out,
because we knew

33:31.440 --> 33:35.960
'he was heading
straight into the jaws
of Tokyo's legendry traffic jams.'

33:35.960 --> 33:39.440
So, it's time taken in Tokyo now.
Yes.

33:39.440 --> 33:43.920
Tokyo is where the battle
will be won or lost.

33:51.280 --> 33:54.120
APPLAUSE

33:56.240 --> 33:59.040
Really struggling
to like that car.

33:59.040 --> 34:02.120
I don't like the way it looks.

34:02.120 --> 34:04.640
And on the, sort of,
dual carriageways,

34:04.640 --> 34:08.440
it's a bit like a digital camera,
you know? It's very clever...

34:08.440 --> 34:10.880
But it's got no soul.
It's got no excitement.

34:10.880 --> 34:14.840
Anyway, we do have a full track test
of this later in the series,

34:14.840 --> 34:17.400
and we'll be picking
the film up later on.

34:17.400 --> 34:21.080
Now, it's time to put some stars
in our reasonably priced car.

34:21.080 --> 34:23.520
Here's a thing, OK?
A lot of people say

34:23.520 --> 34:27.920
that female newsreaders are only
chosen for the way they look.

34:27.920 --> 34:29.679
But plainly, that isn't true,

34:29.679 --> 34:33.560
because my guests tonight
are a right pair of mingers!

34:33.560 --> 34:34.800
LAUGHTER

34:34.800 --> 34:38.440
Ladies and gentlemen,
Fiona Bruce and Kate Silverton!
APPLAUSE

34:41.120 --> 34:46.120
Hello. How are you? Good. Not at all
mingers! Hello. How are you?

34:46.120 --> 34:50.280
Are you well? Very well, thank you.
Have a seat.

34:50.280 --> 34:54.120
Ah! I was looking forward to today.

34:54.120 --> 34:56.120
Good, so were we. Yeah.

34:56.120 --> 35:00.640
You've appeared on Top Gear before.
Yes. You pushed me out of a lift.
Do you remember?

35:00.640 --> 35:04.280
Yes. And then you said something
and I had no idea you were saying it.

35:04.280 --> 35:07.720
A lot of people thought
I said you had a nice bottom.

35:07.720 --> 35:12.040
LAUGHTER
Are you saying you didn't say it?
And you'd be right!

35:13.600 --> 35:19.200
"That Oxford-educated newsreader's
wearing cotton."

35:19.200 --> 35:22.600
LAUGHTER
Jeremy, stand up, let's
have a look at your backside.

35:23.640 --> 35:27.600
It's got a thing on it... Everybody,
what do we think? Facing this way!

35:27.600 --> 35:29.040
SOMEONE WOLF-WHISTLES

35:29.040 --> 35:31.640
It needs a bit of work!
I've been smacked by a...

35:31.640 --> 35:33.880
It's like being Max Mosley!

35:33.880 --> 35:36.680
LAUGHTER

35:36.680 --> 35:39.480
I've been hearing from The Stig.
He says that you

35:39.480 --> 35:43.520
are one of the most talented people
we've ever had round the track.

35:43.520 --> 35:47.560
Who are you looking at? Me?
Yes, you. And you're
one of the most stubborn.

35:47.560 --> 35:50.480
I don't like being told what to do.
He said that.

35:50.480 --> 35:55.040
When he said "Turn left,"
and you turned right
and said, "It's the same thing,"...

35:55.040 --> 35:59.280
Yeah. ..On a track, it sort of isn't.
He kept bossing me around.

35:59.280 --> 36:02.720
I hate that! I liked it!
LAUGHTER

36:02.720 --> 36:07.560
So, you had fun. The only thing
I can think of that is more fun
than this is reading the news.

36:07.560 --> 36:10.880
Really? It'd be fantastic!
I'd love to read the news.

36:10.880 --> 36:13.600
Do you think anyone would
believe you?
LAUGHTER

36:13.600 --> 36:15.920
You wouldn't be allowed to.

36:15.920 --> 36:20.880
You sit in the studio,
warm, read stuff out, lesbians come.

36:20.880 --> 36:24.640
Remember that? Yes. The lesbians
chained themselves to the desk.

36:24.640 --> 36:28.320
We've waited for six years for
lesbians to chain themselves to
things.

36:28.320 --> 36:30.400
Is that your dream? Oh...!

36:30.400 --> 36:31.880
LAUGHTER

36:31.880 --> 36:36.840
We had one guy came in - I
don't think you were there then,
and he was so cross about something -

36:36.840 --> 36:41.200
probably the way we were
presenting or something,
that he broke into the BBC

36:41.200 --> 36:43.800
and hurled a printer
through a glass partition,

36:43.800 --> 36:46.600
as he tried to make his way
into the gallery.

36:46.600 --> 36:51.120
Or your co-presenter
lets your chair down mid-link.
That happens to me a lot.

36:51.120 --> 36:54.640
We couldn't do that with Hammond.
He'd disappear out of view.

36:54.640 --> 36:58.280
You wanted to be a journalist,
didn't you, from a young age?

36:58.280 --> 37:00.680
Yeah. Your heroes were...?

37:00.680 --> 37:05.360
I've always been a bit adventurous,
so, Ranulph Fiennes was
a big hero of mine,

37:05.360 --> 37:08.240
and then I saw the film,
Under Fire, about Nicaragua.

37:08.240 --> 37:10.520
I thought of being
a war correspondent.

37:10.520 --> 37:17.560
I kind of got slightly satiated
when I went to Iraq last year.
Did you get shot at?

37:17.560 --> 37:21.440
I got mortared and dived
for cover on air. Typical BBC!

37:21.440 --> 37:25.200
Me in the middle of the screen with
my two soldiers I was interviewing.

37:25.200 --> 37:28.120
Mortars started dropping.
The solders, "Mortar!"

37:28.120 --> 37:31.240
Sophie Rayworth's on the line going,
"What are you doing?"

37:31.240 --> 37:35.160
This is still live. She says,
"We'll be back with Kate
as soon as we can."

37:35.160 --> 37:38.640
LAUGHTER

37:38.640 --> 37:42.240
I'm quite angry about that.
It's the job I most wanted to have.

37:42.240 --> 37:46.840
Is it?! Oh, Antiques Roadshow?
It is a fantastic job.
Why would you want to do it?

37:46.840 --> 37:50.120
I love all the detail
and that getting in there.

37:50.120 --> 37:53.560
You can tell it wasn't made
in 1643 in Stoke.

37:53.560 --> 37:56.360
But the best thing,
the absolute best thing,

37:56.360 --> 38:00.000
is when they come along, "How much
do you think it's worth?". "£200."

38:00.000 --> 38:01.960
"No, I'm afraid it's worthless."

38:01.960 --> 38:07.400
Or no! When they say, "If you'd kept
it in the original box..." That's...

38:07.400 --> 38:12.720
"It would have been worth £10,000."
Sadly... My favourite one I
ever saw on the Antiques Roadshow,

38:12.720 --> 38:17.920
someone brought a bowl
with a lid on, and she'd
Sellotaped the lid down.

38:17.920 --> 38:22.480
When they'd taken it off, it was
yellow. "If that had been in
its original condition,

38:22.480 --> 38:26.400
"it would have been worth £1,000
but because of something
YOU'VE done,

38:26.400 --> 38:30.280
"it's worth about threepence
ha'penny." I laughed like a
drain for weeks!

38:30.280 --> 38:31.600
LAUGHTER

38:31.600 --> 38:34.600
Now, I want to talk about cars,
if I may. Er, Kate...

38:34.600 --> 38:38.480
Early cars. Anything good
or embarrassing?
I had a lovely early car.

38:38.480 --> 38:42.040
I inherited it from my sister.
She paid £75 for it.

38:42.040 --> 38:45.320
I bet it wasn't lovely.
It was a Citroen Diane.

38:45.320 --> 38:47.200
I was right.

38:47.200 --> 38:50.760
Red. She painted black dots
all over it, so it was a ladybird,

38:50.760 --> 38:54.040
and then I put stickers all over it.
To hold it together? Yeah!

38:54.040 --> 38:57.600
LAUGHTER
I loved it.
I learned everything about the car

38:57.600 --> 39:01.000
because you could mend it
with an elastic band.

39:01.000 --> 39:07.120
Can you mend cars? My dad was a
London cabbie, and insisted that he
wasn't going to have girlie girls.

39:07.120 --> 39:11.640
At least not with me! I'd
change tyres in the middle
of the forest if we broke down.

39:11.640 --> 39:14.760
Why were you in the middle of
a forest when you broke down?

39:14.760 --> 39:20.560
That was always my route home from
the pub with all my friends in the
car. Epping Forest! Essex girl.

39:20.560 --> 39:23.240
Yeah, I am. It's OK!

39:23.240 --> 39:24.360
LAUGHTER

39:24.360 --> 39:27.680
And your cars, then? I got a
Citroen. Which one...? C4 Picasso.

39:27.680 --> 39:29.840
It's great! You didn't buy a Picasso!

39:29.840 --> 39:33.720
It's really good. I love it. It
switches the headlights on for you,

39:33.720 --> 39:37.000
you don't have to put the
handbrake on, it does it for you.

39:37.000 --> 39:39.640
This is hurting you, Jeremy.
My type of driving.

39:39.640 --> 39:43.560
It's a hateful car!
It's not. It's brilliant.

39:43.560 --> 39:46.560
It's not! I can't believe
how rude you are about my car.

39:46.560 --> 39:48.720
He's so rude about my car.
Isn't he rude?

39:48.720 --> 39:50.240
AUDIENCE: Yeah!

39:50.240 --> 39:53.160
Is the Picasso terrible?
AUDIENCE: Yes!

39:53.160 --> 39:56.720
LAUGHTER
Nooo! Come on!

39:56.720 --> 40:00.960
We must get on to your laps.
Oh, God! The weather wasn't good.

40:00.960 --> 40:04.320
The Stig was nice, was he?

40:04.320 --> 40:06.560
Yeah. Very nice, yeah.

40:06.560 --> 40:09.160
He genuinely is impressed with...

40:09.160 --> 40:13.320
I think the follow-through, he said
you did it flat out in fourth gear.

40:13.320 --> 40:18.240
What do you mean the follow-through?
It's a very fast...
LAUGHTER

40:18.240 --> 40:21.720
It's what you do if you
go flat out in fourth gear.

40:21.720 --> 40:26.120
In the pouring rain.
Well, it was only because I think
he must have been kidding.

40:26.120 --> 40:31.200
He said, "Go flat out in fourth!"
When I came out, I went, "I did it."
He went, "You're kidding."

40:31.200 --> 40:35.680
He wanted to give you the kiss
of life if something went wrong!

40:35.680 --> 40:37.560
I have no idea

40:37.560 --> 40:41.360
whose lap is lined up
to go first of all.

40:41.360 --> 40:44.640
Shall we have a look, everybody?
Let's play the tapes.

40:44.640 --> 40:49.680
Who's that in there?
I think it's you, Kate.

40:49.680 --> 40:53.000
'No, it isn't!' BLEEP,
that was first gear!

40:53.000 --> 40:54.480
Now I'm in fifth!

40:54.480 --> 40:57.240
Oh my God, that was hopeless.

40:58.840 --> 41:00.520
'We got the gears sorted out.

41:00.520 --> 41:06.960
'Here we are first corner.
That's lovely.

41:06.960 --> 41:11.440
'All right?!' This is so much
more fun than the school run!

41:11.440 --> 41:13.240
'It is.'

41:14.400 --> 41:15.920
'It looks so slow.'

41:15.920 --> 41:20.440
'Trust me, it isn't.
That's very tight through there.'
God, I need a boat, not a car.

41:20.440 --> 41:24.760
'Coming up to the hammer head.
Are we going outside the line?
You want to watch this.

41:24.760 --> 41:28.560
'Eagle-eyed viewers will report you
for crossing the white line there.'

41:28.560 --> 41:35.840
Fourth gear. Don't brake into
the corner, just go for it! Woo!
'You did it as well!

41:35.840 --> 41:39.520
'That's a follow through.'
'Is it? Oh yeah, I did that quickly.'

41:39.520 --> 41:41.760
'Flat out?' 'Yeah.' 'I'm startled.

41:41.760 --> 41:45.240
'And that's beautiful line
through there. You're being modest.'

41:45.240 --> 41:47.960
'That's on the grass.' Oh, God!

41:47.960 --> 41:52.840
'Here we go, into the last corner.
That's brilliant. Fantastic!'

41:56.680 --> 41:58.920
APPLAUSE
That's very good.

42:00.960 --> 42:05.040
I couldn't change the gears properly!
That looked really fast.

42:05.040 --> 42:10.160
That was really fast. Shall we
have a look at Kate's now? Yes!
Yes, Play the tape. Oh, God!

42:10.160 --> 42:13.000
SKIDDING
'Look at that!'

42:15.880 --> 42:20.520
'Yes.' Oh, my God, I can't
believe I'm officially
in charge of a car on my own.

42:20.520 --> 42:22.400
'Really?' Like this.

42:22.400 --> 42:24.200
'That's an alarming thing to say!

42:24.200 --> 42:28.480
'Into the first corner.' Weeee-ow!

42:28.480 --> 42:31.160
'Like a mouse!

42:31.160 --> 42:33.520
'Come on!' Foot is right down.
BLEEP.

42:33.520 --> 42:35.680
'Sorry!'
LAUGHTER

42:38.680 --> 42:40.200
'I don't know what to say(!)

42:40.200 --> 42:44.040
I don't know who I'm apologising to
but I'm a newsreader.
I shouldn't swear.

42:44.040 --> 42:47.400
'No! Save it for when Gordon Brown
comes on the telly next time!

42:47.400 --> 42:51.960
'Right, here we go.
That's very smooth through there.

42:51.960 --> 42:57.840
'Slightly less exuberance.'
I'm going to go in fourth flat out
round the corner.

42:57.840 --> 43:00.800
'This is very brave
what's happening here.'

43:00.800 --> 43:02.800
Ooooh!
LAUGHTER

43:05.960 --> 43:10.520
Oh, I'm enjoying this!
You don't say(!)

43:11.640 --> 43:14.560
'And again,
that was very smooth through there.

43:14.560 --> 43:16.520
'Cutting the corner nicely round.

43:16.520 --> 43:18.680
'The tyres squeal in that water!'

43:18.680 --> 43:20.560
APPLAUSE

43:26.920 --> 43:30.400
So, Fiona, I've got yours here. OK.
Where do you reckon?

43:30.400 --> 43:34.720
Definitely going to be at the bottom.
No, you're not at the bottom.
You did it in...

43:34.720 --> 43:38.480
one minute, which means you're
not at the bottom. Oh good, yes!

43:38.480 --> 43:42.240
57.4.

43:42.240 --> 43:44.880
That is hugely quick out there.

43:48.600 --> 43:53.880
We could take seven or eight seconds
off that because of that.

43:53.880 --> 43:55.520
Well, bung it up then!

43:55.520 --> 43:59.080
I can't bung it up, that's the time
you did it in. Unfortunately.

43:59.080 --> 44:03.600
Now, Kate. I think I'm bottom then.
You're definitely faster than me.

44:03.600 --> 44:05.720
You reckon?
Without a shadow of a doubt.

44:05.720 --> 44:10.280
No! I think it's bottom.
One minute, so not bottom. OK.

44:10.280 --> 44:14.880
54.7.

44:14.880 --> 44:17.600
APPLAUSE
That is seriously quick.

44:17.600 --> 44:22.240
4.7 is there.

44:22.240 --> 44:26.720
I'm a bit innumerate. If you take
seven or eight seconds off that,

44:26.720 --> 44:29.560
you'd be up with the Trevor Eves
or Gordon Ramsays. Yeah!

44:29.560 --> 44:33.360
Stig was impressed! You should
stick it up there, definitely.

44:33.360 --> 44:37.040
LAUGHTER
In a manner of speaking.
And on that bombshell...

44:37.040 --> 44:40.920
it's probably time to end!
Thank you very much, guys!

44:40.920 --> 44:46.280
Thank YOU! Ladies and gentlemen,
Fiona Bruce and Kate Silverton!

44:52.760 --> 44:55.840
Right, tonight we're
having a race across Japan.

44:55.840 --> 45:00.680
It's between Jeremy in the new GT-R,
which is billed as
a sort of spaceship,

45:00.680 --> 45:06.240
but which we think is just a Datsun,
and us on brilliant
Japanese public transport.

45:06.240 --> 45:09.880
And it is just across Japan,
from here across Tokyo,

45:09.880 --> 45:15.120
across Tokyo Bay, and then up
a mountain to the finish line, where
there's a Buddha to road safety.

45:15.120 --> 45:19.280
Now, when we left the action,
Jeremy had just entered Tokyo,

45:19.280 --> 45:22.360
which is the most jammed up city
in the world,

45:22.360 --> 45:26.720
and we were on the brilliant
Bullet Train doing 200mph...here.

45:33.480 --> 45:36.640
So the car was ahead,

45:36.640 --> 45:42.040
but to maintain that lead,
I was going to be relying heavily
on my Japanese girlfriend, Amy.

45:45.960 --> 45:49.440
SAT NAV INSTRUCTIONS IN JAPANESE

45:49.440 --> 45:53.360
The trouble with Tokyo
is that it is about 50 miles
from one side to the other.

45:53.360 --> 45:56.640
SAT NAV INSTRUCTIONS IN JAPANESE

45:58.360 --> 46:02.240
I was braced for the Tuesday
afternoon traffic that lay ahead.

46:02.240 --> 46:07.520
If it was really bad, all of
Bill Oddie's speeding tickets
would have been for nothing.

46:16.880 --> 46:19.560
I thought he'd still be about here.
We're still in it.

46:19.560 --> 46:23.160
We were now arriving at
Shin-Yokohama Station

46:23.160 --> 46:27.360
on the edge of Tokyo,
and the next part of the journey
for us was critical.

46:28.840 --> 46:32.240
Jeremy could plough straight
through the middle of the city

46:32.240 --> 46:36.720
to get to the bay, but we had to
catch two more trains and a bus

46:36.720 --> 46:39.440
to reach the ferry terminal.

46:39.440 --> 46:42.200
We couldn't afford a single slip.

46:42.200 --> 46:43.880
Transfer to...subway.

46:43.880 --> 46:50.120
Right, fork, yes!
SAT NAV INSTRUCTIONS IN JAPANESE

46:50.120 --> 46:52.680
Amy and I were now
in the middle of Tokyo,

46:52.680 --> 46:59.760
and despite James's claims that
we'd be stuck in traffic for a week,
the simple fact is this -

46:59.760 --> 47:03.440
There wasn't any.

47:03.440 --> 47:07.720
James, "It'll be all traffic,
worst traffic in the world,
you won't move." Look at it!

47:07.720 --> 47:12.680
We had less than ten minutes
to catch our next connection.

47:12.680 --> 47:17.880
Er... That's the subway. Subway.
Tokyo's not a city,
it's a racetrack.

47:17.880 --> 47:19.240
BEEPING

47:19.240 --> 47:23.240
Well, that's no good. Do we have to
have another ticket? I don't know.

47:28.520 --> 47:30.440
Er... Can we ask? How do we buy?

47:30.440 --> 47:33.480
Where do we get off? Honestly,

47:33.480 --> 47:35.320
I didn't think
I was going to win it.

47:35.320 --> 47:38.440
That's obviously the fare, it
gets bigger as you go further away.

47:38.440 --> 47:41.240
How much do we need?
Bullet train, pah!

47:43.240 --> 47:44.960
Right, I think it was this way.

47:44.960 --> 47:47.840
Right, go! Go, go, go, go!

47:47.840 --> 47:53.280
We were in such a rush we boarded
the tube train not knowing if it
was going in the right direction.

47:54.960 --> 47:58.920
This is the Yokohama city subway,
but does it...go to Yokohama?

47:58.920 --> 48:02.800
Yokohama, number 20...

48:02.800 --> 48:09.000
It's four stops. So if this flashes
23, that's the next stop and we're
going in the right direction.

48:09.000 --> 48:12.000
If it says 25,
we've got to jump off.

48:12.000 --> 48:15.000
23...

48:17.440 --> 48:20.240
Yes. Yes!

48:20.240 --> 48:21.600
I didn't panic(!)

48:23.160 --> 48:26.600
This is what comes of not
having a congestion charge.

48:39.120 --> 48:43.680
We were now at yet another station
looking for the train to Kurihama.

48:43.680 --> 48:45.800
Kurihama? Kurihama?

48:45.800 --> 48:47.440
Kurihama?

48:49.480 --> 48:53.160
I was so confident that
when I did occasionally
get stuck at the lights,

48:53.160 --> 48:57.400
I broke out some of the Japanese
toys the office had provided.

48:57.400 --> 48:57.440
TOY GUITAR PLAYS

48:57.480 --> 48:59.080

49:09.880 --> 49:14.120

It's May or Hammond.

49:14.120 --> 49:18.120
Hello. Jeremy. Hammond, how are you?
I'm very well,

49:18.120 --> 49:19.520
how are you doing?

49:19.520 --> 49:24.280
I am in Tokyo, and I'm
going brilliantly well,
I shall look on my sat nav.

49:24.280 --> 49:26.040
'How fast are you going?'

49:27.720 --> 49:31.960
Oh, my God. What?
I've just turned the sat...

49:31.960 --> 49:33.680
I've turned the sat nav off.

49:33.680 --> 49:35.960
Why did you do that?

49:35.960 --> 49:41.000
I just wanted to look where I was,
cos it comes up on
the phone thing when you're on.

49:41.000 --> 49:45.640
Well, I can tell you exactly
where you are now you've
turned your sat nav off. Lost! Bye!

49:45.640 --> 49:52.600
With all the sat nav's controls
in Japanese, I had no clue
how to get it back on again.

49:52.600 --> 49:54.960
Oh, this is just...

49:54.960 --> 49:56.360
I'm going to have to...

49:59.160 --> 50:01.040
This was a good moment.

50:01.040 --> 50:06.720
We had successfully caught the last
of our four trains and would be
at the finish line in two hours.

50:06.720 --> 50:10.240
Meanwhile, Jeremy,
for the first time, was in trouble.

50:13.280 --> 50:15.280
No.

50:18.360 --> 50:24.400
Right, there's a plane coming in
to land there, that must
mean...Narita airport's over there.

50:27.000 --> 50:31.000
TRANSLATOR SPEAKS JAPANESE
Sorry, I just asked for
the wine list.

50:31.000 --> 50:36.040
That's not right. Amazingly, I
found a policeman who spoke English.

50:36.040 --> 50:38.000
'Sort of.' Yes, this tunnel.

50:38.000 --> 50:41.600
This road will lead down, uh...

50:41.600 --> 50:45.760
one, two, three...four signal.

50:45.760 --> 50:48.440
Lights? So four signals?

50:48.440 --> 50:51.120
Four, maybe. Maybe?

50:51.120 --> 50:58.320
As our train waited in the station,
I went to try my luck with one
of the onboard drinks machines.

50:58.320 --> 51:01.080
MOBILE RINGS
Then James rang.

51:01.080 --> 51:05.400
Hello? Yeah, will do. I haven't
found a vending machine yet,
but as soon as I do, I will.

51:05.400 --> 51:07.560
Yeah, but we're not moving.

51:09.600 --> 51:11.160
Well, not now we're not.

51:12.880 --> 51:15.400
What do you mean we are?
No, we're not.

51:17.800 --> 51:19.840
Mate, I'm not on the...

51:19.840 --> 51:21.040
How can I not...?

51:22.200 --> 51:26.160
Gear position,
braking, acceleration.

51:28.640 --> 51:30.640
MOBILE RINGS
Hello.

51:30.640 --> 51:35.840
James? No, it's not James,
it's me... Why would James
be ringing you up?

51:37.760 --> 51:40.040
Because there's...

51:40.040 --> 51:42.240
Something peculiar has happened.

51:42.240 --> 51:45.240
We're not on the same train.

51:45.240 --> 51:47.000
What?! Hello.

51:47.000 --> 51:49.560
We're not on the same train.

51:49.560 --> 51:54.600
The train stopped in a station,
I was walking along it to try and
find some drinks from a machine,

51:54.600 --> 51:58.520
and then James had moved off, he was
in the front of the train, it split,

51:58.520 --> 52:00.960
I don't know where yet.

52:00.960 --> 52:06.440
I stopped in the station, then
I got off my train to see what had
happened, and then my train left.

52:06.440 --> 52:09.000
So if that was the right train,
I'm not on it.

52:09.000 --> 52:12.920
If it wasn't the right...
One of us is on the right train,
one of us isn't.

52:12.920 --> 52:16.280
If it's any consolation, mate,
I've just arrived at a dead end.

52:16.280 --> 52:20.280
I've got to ring James now,
I'm sorry.

52:20.280 --> 52:23.560
I might just go for a cup of coffee
on this basis. Ha-ha-ha!

52:25.560 --> 52:29.160
'I was just now all alone with just
a Blair Witch Handycam.'

52:31.160 --> 52:32.800
Hello, viewers.

52:32.800 --> 52:38.520
Jezzer has obviously
spoken to Hammond, because Jezzer's
just rung me up to gloat.

52:39.920 --> 52:41.920
Erm... Kurihama?

52:41.920 --> 52:43.400
Kurihama, yeah.

52:43.400 --> 52:45.800
OK, moment, please. Come down.

52:45.800 --> 52:50.200
This man got me on the
right train, and I called James.

52:57.960 --> 53:04.720
But my train was 15 minutes behind
James's, so I'd have less than
two minutes to catch the bus.

53:04.720 --> 53:07.360
You're going to have to hold it.

53:07.360 --> 53:11.760
Just run like hell from the bus,
because if you miss
the bus, we're stuffed.

lost had cost me 45 minutes.

53:28.800 --> 53:32.320

There's no buses.

53:58.320 --> 54:02.680
I was now heading for the tunnel
under the bay in a big hurry,

54:02.680 --> 54:06.600
and for the first time
the GT-R was starting to come alive.

54:06.600 --> 54:12.440
When you put your foot down like
that, you just get the vaguest whiff

54:12.440 --> 54:16.160
that this car can go round the
Nurburgring in 7 minutes 29 seconds.

54:16.160 --> 54:21.400
That's faster than
a McLaren Mercedes,
it's faster than a 911 Turbo.

Mate, they're cross

Hello? We're in trouble now for
talking on a phone on the bus.

54:35.720 --> 54:38.600
He wants to talk to you.

54:38.600 --> 54:42.800
Oh... Hi.
Do you know what time you're
actually getting on that ferry?

54:42.800 --> 54:46.920
25 past, it leaves, we're getting
on it at about 22 minutes past.

54:47.920 --> 54:51.520
All of us were now
minutes from the bay.

54:54.840 --> 54:57.200
Is that bell bad?

55:04.520 --> 55:05.920
This is really close now.

55:07.760 --> 55:11.360
Still in the bosom of
Japanese public transport,

55:11.360 --> 55:16.000
the finish line in 55 minutes.

55:16.000 --> 55:20.160
All we could do was hope Jeremy's
life would be less predictable.

55:20.160 --> 55:21.800
It depends... How busy it is.

55:21.800 --> 55:27.320
..on the terrain, whether it's
small roads, whether it's busy,
whether there's a speed limit,

55:27.320 --> 55:29.840
whether he gets lost.

55:29.840 --> 55:34.280
Small roads? No, not really.

55:48.320 --> 55:54.320
As the immense bridge ended,
I knew it would all be down to
the final charge up the mountain.

55:54.320 --> 56:01.480
Frankly, what I'm going to need
to win this now is a divine wind,
and I've got just the thing.

56:01.480 --> 56:04.880
I'm ready! Here we go!

56:09.880 --> 56:15.120
I knew they'd be at the finish line
at 4.25 precisely.

56:15.120 --> 56:18.160
Arrival time, 4.31.

56:18.160 --> 56:20.080
That's six minutes after them.

56:23.120 --> 56:26.360
I'm putting the gear box in race,
that speeds up the change time.

56:26.360 --> 56:29.600
I'm going to put the suspension in
race, that firms it right up.

56:29.600 --> 56:33.960
Then I'm going to put
the traction control in race,
that lets me have some slip.

56:33.960 --> 56:41.480
Bang on time, the ferry docked,
a full mile from the cable car,
but we had no intention of walking.

56:48.000 --> 56:51.400
I've no time to slow down
for these barriers.

56:51.400 --> 56:55.480
Wimbledon with barriers
like that on the end of your arm.

56:58.080 --> 57:01.880
Ahead of me lay the mountain road -
GT-R country.

57:04.640 --> 57:11.600
God...
Just now it's all coming together,
it's all just becoming a GT-R.

57:13.120 --> 57:17.720
'Hello.' Jeremy. Yeah,
where are you?

57:17.720 --> 57:19.680
We are disembarking now.

57:19.680 --> 57:23.480

I can't work it out,
but he is...he is...very close.

57:28.720 --> 57:31.760
I've now got it down to 4.27.

57:31.760 --> 57:34.360
Ready? Yes.

57:34.360 --> 57:35.560
Let's do it. Right.

57:42.280 --> 57:44.480
Uh! Wah! Ah!

57:44.480 --> 57:45.960
Ah!

57:50.480 --> 57:53.000
4.24.

57:53.000 --> 57:57.520
This is the clash
of the titans now, and it's
going down to the wire again.

58:02.360 --> 58:05.840
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

58:14.320 --> 58:17.160
I wish you could feel
my heart rate now.

58:17.160 --> 58:20.960
I really wish you could
feel what's going on here.

58:20.960 --> 58:22.560
Go!

58:26.240 --> 58:29.480
Hold on! Thank you.

58:31.840 --> 58:37.680
Come on, come on, come on, baby!
'I was now giving it everything.'

58:39.720 --> 58:42.640
So at the top here there is a Buddha

58:42.640 --> 58:45.240
to road safety. Apparently.

58:45.240 --> 58:50.320
Wouldn't it be brilliant if
we got there and Jeremy's GT-R
was buried in the middle of it?

58:50.320 --> 58:52.920
"Watch this, I'm here..."
"Oh, dear." "Bang."

58:56.520 --> 58:59.040
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

59:02.600 --> 59:06.760
This way. Finally, I made it
to to the Buddha's car park.

59:06.760 --> 59:09.000
Victory is mine!

59:09.000 --> 59:10.680
But that wasn't the finishing line.

59:10.680 --> 59:13.480
Go where? Where?

59:13.480 --> 59:17.240
Run! Come on, go, go, go!
Just leave it, leave it, leave it!

59:17.240 --> 59:18.560
That's not a temple.

59:18.560 --> 59:22.880
We were now converging on
the Buddha up two different paths.

59:22.880 --> 59:26.960
Are you sure we haven't overshot it?
Come on!

59:29.120 --> 59:30.680
No!

59:39.480 --> 59:42.320
Please, God...
don't let them be here.

59:42.320 --> 59:45.360
HE PANTS HEAVILY

59:50.680 --> 59:52.160
They aren't here.

59:58.760 --> 01:00:00.560
A car just beat the Bullet Train.

01:00:06.080 --> 01:00:08.720
That's Buddha!
This is the Buddha to road safety!

01:00:08.720 --> 01:00:15.880
And this wall was 12th century,
erm...so you remember from
the lecture I was giving you...

01:00:15.880 --> 01:00:17.680
Hi, guys! Oh.

01:00:17.680 --> 01:00:21.640
Just interesting...how this
is a different century to that.

01:00:21.640 --> 01:00:24.160
Yeah. Yeah.

01:00:24.160 --> 01:00:27.920
You ran up there as well? Oh, yeah.

01:00:27.920 --> 01:00:30.040
Congratulations.

01:00:30.040 --> 01:00:32.720
How long have you been here?
Really not long.

01:00:32.720 --> 01:00:34.600
Genuinely? Honestly?

01:00:34.600 --> 01:00:38.440
Three minutes 12 seconds.

01:00:38.440 --> 01:00:41.040
That is so close.

01:00:41.040 --> 01:00:43.560
Thanks, Buddha.
You looked after him.

01:00:43.560 --> 01:00:46.800
Disappointed! Wait for it.

01:00:46.800 --> 01:00:51.360
TRANSLATOR SPEAKS JAPANESE
Which is? That's the Japanese...
For? "Oh, cock!"

01:01:12.120 --> 01:01:13.760
Now, look,

01:01:13.760 --> 01:01:17.880
we do arrange those races so that
we know they're going to be
close, but even so.

01:01:17.880 --> 01:01:23.040
That really was astonishing. Anyway,
there's not much else to say now,
except thank you, Tokyo,

01:01:23.040 --> 01:01:26.840
for being empty and thank you
very much for watching.

01:01:26.840 --> 01:01:28.560
See you next week, good night!

01:01:28.560 --> 01:01:30.000
CHEERS AND APPLAUSE
