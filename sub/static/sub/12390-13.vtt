07:59.690 --> 08:00.884
THIS IS AN ETERNITY RING.

08:00.920 --> 08:02.456
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO WEAR THIS
ALL THE TIME,

08:02.490 --> 08:05.368
AND IT'S USUALLY GIVEN TO YOU
BY SOMEONE, YOU KNOW, INTIMATE.

08:05.400 --> 08:06.992
WHY DO YOU KNOW THAT?

08:07.040 --> 08:08.462
I GAVE ONE TO JESSICA CHAN.

08:08.510 --> 08:10.273
AH, YES.

08:10.310 --> 08:11.846
JESSICA CHAN.

08:11.880 --> 08:13.472
AND HOW LONG WAS ETERNITY
FOR THE TWO OF YOU?

08:13.510 --> 08:15.717
THREE MONTHS,
BUT THEY WERE AWESOME MONTHS.

08:15.750 --> 08:17.081
EXCEPT FOR THE END PART.

08:17.120 --> 08:18.485
RIGHT, I'D NEVER
SEEN A GIRL LIE

08:18.530 --> 08:20.384
ABOUT ENTERING
THE WITNESS PROTECTION PROGRAM.

08:20.430 --> 08:21.397
SHE WASN'T LYING, SHAWN.

08:21.430 --> 08:22.624
GUS, I SAW HER AT STARBUCKS.

08:22.670 --> 08:23.625
YOU CAN'T BE SURE OF THAT.

08:23.670 --> 08:25.035
SHE WAS WEARING
A NAME TAG.

08:25.070 --> 08:26.037
SHE HAD A PLAQUE
ON THE WALL.

08:26.070 --> 08:27.230
EMPLOYEE OF THE MONTH.

08:27.280 --> 08:30.249
HER HOBBIES WERE HIDING
AND LYING ABOUT HIDING.

08:30.280 --> 08:31.588
FINE. WHATEVER.

08:31.620 --> 08:32.746
DROP IT.

08:32.790 --> 08:34.485
MY POINT IS,
WHY ISN'T DEANNA WEARING HERS

08:34.520 --> 08:36.056
ALL THE TIME?

08:36.090 --> 08:38.149
SHE CLEARLY HAS SOMEONE
DADDY DOESN'T APPROVE OF.

08:38.200 --> 08:40.464
WE FIND
THE MYSTERY LOVER,

08:40.500 --> 08:42.809
WE FIND HER.

08:44.310 --> 08:47.814
DUDE, WHY DON'T I EVER
GET TO SAY STUFF LIKE THAT?

08:49.620 --> 08:50.587
ALL RIGHT, GET HER
DOWN TO THE STATION,

08:50.620 --> 08:51.587
TAKE HER STATEMENT.

08:51.630 --> 08:52.654

08:52.690 --> 08:53.884
THE LAST TIME SHE SAW DEANNA.

08:53.930 --> 08:55.659
I'M ON MY WAY IN NOW.

08:55.700 --> 08:57.338
I'M SENSING

08:57.370 --> 09:01.079
YOU'RE DRINKING
A NON-FAT VANILLA HALF-CAF

09:01.080 --> 09:02.479
WITH LOTS OF WHIPPED CREAM

09:02.510 --> 09:04.171
BUT WITHOUT
YOUR USUAL PINK STRAW.

09:04.220 --> 09:05.983
WHAT, ARE YOU TWO
STALKING ME NOW?

09:06.020 --> 09:07.817
OR DID YOU COME TO TELL ME
WHERE THE MISSING GIRL IS?

09:07.860 --> 09:08.781
NO.

09:08.820 --> 09:09.787
BUT...

09:09.830 --> 09:11.058
I DID DIVINE

09:11.100 --> 09:13.125
THAT DEANNA HAS
A SECRET BOYFRIEND,

09:13.170 --> 09:14.535
WHICH SOUNDS
LIKE A LEAD TO ME.

09:14.570 --> 09:17.004
YEAH, WE'RE LOOKING INTO
ALL HER RELATIONSHIPS.

09:17.040 --> 09:18.530
BUT YOU SEE, IT'S MY JOB
TO INVESTIGATE PEOPLE

09:18.580 --> 09:19.547
WITH THINGS LIKE,
YOU KNOW,

09:19.580 --> 09:22.583
MOTIVE, MEANS,
AND OPPORTUNITY.

09:22.620 --> 09:23.814
STOP FOLLOWING ME.

09:23.860 --> 09:24.815

09:24.860 --> 09:25.952

09:27.560 --> 09:28.959
I'VE BEEN MEANING TO HAVE
THE SAME CONVERSATION WITH YOU

09:29.000 --> 09:30.228
ABOUT LEADING ME.

09:30.270 --> 09:31.760
TO BE HONEST,
I'M SICK OF IT.

09:31.810 --> 09:34.005
WE EITHER WALK SIDE BY SIDE
OR NOT AT ALL.

09:34.040 --> 09:36.008
[HORN HONKING]

09:40.290 --> 09:42.110
SHAWN, SIX MONTHS AGO,
I CALLED YOU UP,

09:42.160 --> 09:44.549
ASKED YOU WHETHER OR NOT
YOU WANTED ANY OF THIS JUNK.

09:44.600 --> 09:45.760
HOW COME YOU ONLY CALL ME
TO COME PICK UP STUFF?

09:45.800 --> 09:47.028
YOU DIDN'T LISTEN.

09:47.070 --> 09:48.389
NOW I'M DONATING ALL OF IT
TO GOODWILL.

09:48.440 --> 09:50.237
I'M ON MY WAY THERE RIGHT NOW,
SO YOU'VE GOT ABOUT 30 SECONDS.

09:50.280 --> 09:51.941

YOU CAN'T GET THIS
IN STORES ANYMORE.

09:59.360 --> 10:00.725
WAIT A SECOND.

10:00.760 --> 10:02.569
THIS IS MY
AIRWOLF WINDBREAKER.

10:02.600 --> 10:03.760
I'VE BEEN
LOOKING FOR THIS

10:03.800 --> 10:04.596
FOR LIKE FIVE YEARS NOW.

10:04.640 --> 10:05.538
WHY DID YOU
TAKE THIS?

10:05.570 --> 10:06.502
I NEVER EVEN
SAW YOU WEAR IT.

10:06.540 --> 10:07.973
OF COURSE
I DIDN'T WEAR IT.

10:08.010 --> 10:08.931
I TOOK IT SO YOU WOULDN'T.

10:08.980 --> 10:11.141
DON'T PUT IT ON.

10:11.180 --> 10:13.387
GUS, NOBODY HAD
AN AIRWOL JACKET

10:13.420 --> 10:14.978
EXCEPT
JAN-MICHAEL VINCENT.

10:15.020 --> 10:16.021

10:16.060 --> 10:17.652
THIS LOOKS LIKE
A CUSTOM SAK-HART

10:17.700 --> 10:18.689

10:18.730 --> 10:19.867
THAT'S RIGHT.

10:19.900 --> 10:21.595
GOOD EYE.

10:21.640 --> 10:22.607
YOU CAN'T THROW
SOMETHING LIKE THIS AWAY.

10:22.640 --> 10:24.005
IT'S 15 YEARS OLD.

10:24.040 --> 10:25.075

10:25.110 --> 10:27.510

IT'S NEVER BEEN USED.

PRACTICING THERE

11:19.250 --> 11:20.615
THE MORNING
SHE DISAPPEARED.

11:20.660 --> 11:22.218
IF SHE'S SOME SORT
OF TENNIS STAR,

11:22.260 --> 11:23.454

GOES THERE A LOT.

WITH HER MYSTERY LOVER.

11:35.450 --> 11:36.747
DEANNA'S COACH
IS IN TOKYO,

REALLY IS IN TOKYO.

ABOUT THIS.

15:16.160 --> 15:17.718
SHE'S GOING TO BE HERE,

15:17.760 --> 15:20.228
SAFE AND SOUND.

15:25.510 --> 15:26.647
OR NOT.

15:32.430 --> 15:34.227
ALL RIGHT, I WANT TO TALK TO HER
THE MINUTE SHE WAKES UP.

15:35.970 --> 15:37.494
IF SHE WAKES UP.

15:38.670 --> 15:40.979
WHAT HAPPENED HERE?

15:41.010 --> 15:43.149
THIS ISN'T A MISSING PERSON CASE
ANYMORE.

15:43.180 --> 15:44.602
IT'S ATTEMPTED MURDER.

15:45.920 --> 15:47.478
MAN.

15:47.520 --> 15:50.057
EVEN SHE GETS TO SAY
STUFF LIKE THAT.

15:55.700 --> 15:58.373
[CAMERA CLICKING]

16:06.690 --> 16:07.725
THAT'S MORE
CRAPPY JEWELRY.

16:07.760 --> 16:09.022
THE WORKING CLASS
BOYFRIEN D

16:09.070 --> 16:10.526
HAS BEEN HERE.

16:10.570 --> 16:12.197
HEY, AREN'T YOU
HENRY SPENCER'S KID?

16:12.240 --> 16:14.208
THAT I AM.

16:14.240 --> 16:15.639
I TOOK A SIX-WEEK COURSE
HE TAUGHT AT THE ACADEMY.

16:15.680 --> 16:16.647
LUCKY YOU.

16:16.680 --> 16:18.739
HOW WAS HE?

16:18.780 --> 16:20.589
UH...

16:20.620 --> 16:22.417
YEAH, THAT JUST ABOUT
SUMS IT UP.

16:23.530 --> 16:24.428
YOU MIND
IF WE POKE AROUND A LITTLE?

16:24.460 --> 16:25.552
NO.

16:26.730 --> 16:28.288
WE DO.

16:28.340 --> 16:29.568
WE MIND QUITE A BIT,
ACTUALLY.

16:29.600 --> 16:30.567
YOU KNOW WHAT?

16:30.610 --> 16:31.975
SCRATCH THAT.

16:32.010 --> 16:33.443
I'M GOING TO LET YOU GUYS
STICK AROUND

16:33.480 --> 16:34.549
AND SEE WHAT
REAL DETECT IVES DO.

16:34.580 --> 16:35.911
SWEET.

16:35.950 --> 16:36.882
JUST LET US KNOW
WHEN THEY ARRIVE.

16:38.020 --> 16:40.227
DEANNA SHARED THIS PLACE
WITH ANOTHER PLAYER ON THE TOUR,

16:40.260 --> 16:41.488
SO HER NAME WASN'T ON THE LEASE,

16:41.530 --> 16:43.225
BUT LASSITER FOUND

16:43.270 --> 16:44.726
ONE OF HER CLOSE FRIENDS.

16:44.770 --> 16:45.998
APPARENTLY, THEY MET FREQUENTLY

16:46.040 --> 16:47.268
AT THAT INDIAN
RESTAURANT.

16:47.310 --> 16:48.379
WE CANVASSED THE AREA

16:48.410 --> 16:49.672
WITH HER PHOTO,

16:49.710 --> 16:51.075
AND THE OWNER OF THIS BUILDING
RECOGNIZED HER,

16:51.120 --> 16:52.974
SO WE OPENED THE DOOR,
AND VOILA.

16:53.020 --> 16:54.089
VOILA.

16:54.120 --> 16:55.883
O'HARA,
COME TAKE A LOOK AT THIS.

16:58.260 --> 17:01.263
CHECK THIS OUT.

17:06.980 --> 17:09.540
I THINK THESE WERE ALL TAKEN
INSIDE THIS APARTMENT.

17:09.590 --> 17:12.479
I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT.

17:19.240 --> 17:20.229
WAIT A SECOND.

17:20.270 --> 17:22.830
WHAT?

17:25.010 --> 17:26.580
I SEE SOMETHING!

17:28.160 --> 17:29.252
I SEE...

17:29.290 --> 17:31.099
A TROPHY...

17:31.130 --> 17:32.597
BUT I'M OUT OF PLACE.

17:32.630 --> 17:34.791
I'VE BEEN...

17:34.830 --> 17:36.229
KIDNAPPED!

17:37.440 --> 17:38.771
THERE IS A TROPHY
MISSING FROM HERE,

17:38.810 --> 17:41.847
AND WE KNOW SHE SUFFERED
A BLUNT FORCE TRAUMA.

17:41.880 --> 17:42.744
POSSIBLY THE WEAPON.

17:42.790 --> 17:43.688
GOOD WORK, O'HARA.

17:43.720 --> 17:45.415
O'HARA? THAT WAS ALL US.

17:45.460 --> 17:47.257
I THINK YOUR TUTORIAL
IN POLICE WORK IS DONE NOW.

17:47.300 --> 17:48.392
GOODBYE.

17:58.450 --> 17:59.576
IT'S COOL.

17:59.620 --> 18:01.554
I'VE GOT EVERYTHING WE NEED.

18:05.760 --> 18:08.297
DEANNA IS LISTED
AS CRITICAL BUT STABLE FOR NOW.

18:08.340 --> 18:10.467
SHE'S TOUCH AND GO
FOR THE NEXT 48 HOURS.

18:10.510 --> 18:11.636
[MAN ON TV]:
...AND IS CONSIDERED

18:11.680 --> 18:12.647
TO BE ARMED
AND DANGEROUS.

18:12.680 --> 18:13.704
ANYONE WITH INFORMATION

18:13.750 --> 18:14.808
AS TO THE WHEREABOUTS
OF THIS MAN...

18:14.850 --> 18:16.147
GOSH.

18:16.190 --> 18:17.418
FINDING DEANNA

18:17.450 --> 18:18.587
LIT A FIRE
UNDER THE DEPARTMENT.

18:18.620 --> 18:19.882
LASSITER'S BEEN HAVING
TH ESE ADVISORY ALERTS

18:19.930 --> 18:21.295
RUN 24/7.

18:21.330 --> 18:22.592
SO LET ME
GET THIS STRAIGHT.

18:22.630 --> 18:24.166
THEIR THEORY

18:24.200 --> 18:25.792
IS THAT FELIX FOLLOWED HER
TO HER HIDEAWAY

18:25.840 --> 18:27.307
AND SHOWED HIS LOVE
BY TRYING TO KILL HER?

18:27.340 --> 18:28.375
NOT A TERRIBLE THEORY.

18:28.410 --> 18:31.846
LET'S REVIEW, SHALL WE?

18:31.880 --> 18:32.881
NO FORCED ENTRY.

18:32.920 --> 18:33.909
THAT MEANS SHE EITHER
LET THE ATTACKER IN

18:33.950 --> 18:35.212
OR HE HAD A KEY.

18:35.260 --> 18:37.524
SOUNDS LIKE SOMEONE
SHE WAS INTIMATE WITH.

18:37.560 --> 18:39.391
NOW, THE TOILET SEAT
IN HER APARTMENT

18:39.430 --> 18:40.658
WAS UP,

18:40.700 --> 18:42.099
SO WE KNOW THERE WAS A GUY THERE
RECENTLY.

18:42.140 --> 18:43.402
I DOUBT A KILLER STOPPED

18:43.440 --> 18:44.429
TO USE
THE LITTLE BOYS' ROOM,

18:44.470 --> 18:45.903
SO LET'S ASSUME
THE PHANTOM BOYFRIEND

18:45.940 --> 18:47.749
STOPPED BY FOR A MATINEE.

18:49.350 --> 18:50.715
AND THERE WERE
TWO WINE GLASSES

18:50.750 --> 18:51.887
MISSING FROM HER SET,

18:51.920 --> 18:53.319
SO SHE PROBABLY SHARED
A DRINK WITH HIM,

18:53.360 --> 18:54.679
AND HE GRABBED
THE GLASSES,

18:54.730 --> 18:56.049
WHICH HAD HIS
FINGERPRINTS ON THEM,

18:56.100 --> 19:00.139
AS HE BEAT
A DISCREET RETREAT.

19:01.480 --> 19:03.744
NONE OF THAT POINTS TO FELIX.

19:04.810 --> 19:05.970
I GOT TO GET BACK TO WORK.

19:06.020 --> 19:06.987
NOW?

19:07.020 --> 19:08.112
YOU'RE GOING TO
LEAVE NOW,

19:08.160 --> 19:09.286
WHEN WE'RE UP
TO OUR NECKS IN INTRIGUE?

19:09.330 --> 19:10.558
THE CASE IS ALMOST CLOSED.

19:10.590 --> 19:11.818
WE HAVE THE GIRL.
SHE'S STILL ALIVE.

19:11.860 --> 19:13.794
THE COPS BEAT US.
LET THEM HAVE THIS ONE.

19:13.830 --> 19:14.865
HOW CAN YOU BE SO NEGATIVE?

19:14.900 --> 19:16.265
EASY.
I NEED FACE TIME WITH MY BOSS.

19:16.310 --> 19:17.504
I ALREADY MISSED
THE PAMPER POLE TRUST EXERCISE.

19:17.540 --> 19:18.871
I'M UNCOMFORTABLE

19:18.910 --> 19:20.047
WITH YOU EVEN SAYING
THE WORDS "PAMPER POLE."

19:20.080 --> 19:21.718
LOOK, EVERY MINUTE
THE COPS SPEND

19:21.750 --> 19:23.513
LOOKING FOR FELIX,

19:23.550 --> 19:24.585
THE REAL ATTACKER
BREATHES EASIER.

19:24.620 --> 19:25.848
NOW, WE HAVE
GOT TO CONVINCE THEM

19:25.890 --> 19:27.357
TO START LOOKING
FOR OTHER SUSPECT S.

19:27.400 --> 19:28.549
NO.

19:28.600 --> 19:30.067

YOU CAN GIVE US

19:30.100 --> 19:31.431

WHAT'RE YOU DOING HERE?

20:34.860 --> 20:36.498

YOUR CELL PHONE.

20:36.530 --> 20:38.031

AS IN, "LEAVE ME ALONE."

ON VISITORS.

20:42.040 --> 20:43.109
HE'S NOT A VISITOR. HE'S--

20:43.150 --> 20:44.105
JERRY HATHAWAY.

20:44.150 --> 20:45.117
I, TOO, WORK AT CENTRAL COAST.

20:45.150 --> 20:46.913
IN THE LAB.

20:48.160 --> 20:51.459
YES, I WORKED ON THE
MONO-THIO-HUXTABLE DRUG.

20:51.500 --> 20:52.899
IT'S FOR PANCAKE-REACTIC
FUNCTION.

20:52.930 --> 20:54.591
PANCREATIC.

20:54.640 --> 20:55.595
ACTUALLY, NO, BURTON,

20:55.640 --> 20:57.039
IT WAS PANCAKE.

20:57.070 --> 20:58.230
REALLY.
YES.

20:58.280 --> 20:59.736
THERE ARE PROPERTIES
IN THE BATTER

20:59.780 --> 21:01.372
THAT HELPED TO STABILIZE
THE IONS WE WERE WORKING WITH.

21:01.410 --> 21:02.513
I'VE NEVER HEARD
OF THAT PROJECT.

21:02.520 --> 21:04.681
IT WAS A GREAT DRUG.

21:04.720 --> 21:07.553
BUT IT CAUSED HEADACHES,
STOMACH ACHES, TOOTHACH ES,

IT MADE YOU PEE FIRE.

OF AN IMPACT

21:25.060 --> 21:26.664

LOOKED UP TO GUS.

I WISH I WAS.

EXERCISE TOGETHER?

22:04.640 --> 22:06.301
NO, WE CAN'T DO THAT.

22:06.350 --> 22:08.409
I BELIEVE YOUR FRIEND
IS REACHING OUT RIGHT NOW.

22:08.450 --> 22:09.940
I THINK YOU TWO
WOULD BE PERFECT CANDIDATES

22:09.990 --> 22:11.343
FOR THE MINEFIELD.

22:11.390 --> 22:13.312
BURTON, YOU HAVE TO KEEP
YOUR EYES CLOSED

22:13.360 --> 22:15.123
WHILE YOUR FRIEND LEADS YOU
THROUGH A SERIES OF OBSTACLES.

22:15.160 --> 22:17.424
OH, TOM, THAT SOUNDS
REALLY BITCHIN'!

22:17.470 --> 22:18.960
YEAH.

22:19.000 --> 22:21.139
UH, CAN I TALK TO HIM ALONE
FOR A SECOND?

22:21.170 --> 22:22.137
SURE.

22:22.180 --> 22:23.249
OH, GREAT. THANKS.

22:23.280 --> 22:24.372
OH, GOSH.

22:24.410 --> 22:25.513
DUDE, I'VE GOT BAD NEWS.
WHAT?

22:25.550 --> 22:26.539
DEANNA'S DOCTORS SAY

22:26.580 --> 22:27.854
SHE'S SHOWING SIGNS
OF IMPROVEMENT.

22:27.890 --> 22:29.016
IN THE HEALTH CARE
COMMUNITY,

22:29.060 --> 22:30.152
WE CALL THAT GOOD NEWS.

22:30.190 --> 22:31.657
GIVEN WHAT WE ALREADY KNOW?

22:32.430 --> 22:33.397
DOES SHE KNOW HER ATTACKER?

22:33.430 --> 22:34.738
YES.
DOES THAT MEAN

22:34.770 --> 22:36.431
WHEN SHE WAKES UP
SHE CAN I.D. HIM?

22:36.470 --> 22:38.279
SHE I.D.s HIM
AND THE CASE IS CLOSED.

22:38.310 --> 22:39.607
WHERE'S THE DOWNSIDE?

22:39.640 --> 22:40.607
BECAUSE IF YOU'RE
THE BAD GUY

22:40.650 --> 22:41.674
AND YOU KNOW YOUR VICTIM
CAN WAKE UP

22:41.720 --> 22:42.744
AND POINT THE FINGER
AT YOU--

22:42.790 --> 22:44.610
[GRIMLY]: HE'LL FIND HER
AND FINISH HER OFF.

22:46.190 --> 22:47.680
YOU'RE JUST NOT LANDING IT.

DEANNA'S LIFE IS IN DANGER NOW
MORE THEN EVER,

22:50.870 --> 22:52.235
AND SHE NEEDS US.

22:52.270 --> 22:53.464
BURTON...

22:53.510 --> 22:54.829
IS THERE A PROBLEM?

22:54.880 --> 22:56.871
YES, TOM, I'M AFRAID THERE IS.

22:56.910 --> 22:58.275
BURTON'S GRANDMOTHER
JUST CALLED.

22:58.320 --> 23:00.288
SHE'S BROKEN HER HIP.

23:00.320 --> 23:02.311
I THOUGHT YOU DEALT
WITH THAT ISSUE ALREADY.

23:02.360 --> 23:04.089
THE OTHER SIDE.
TORE THE MCL.

23:04.130 --> 23:05.279
SHE DID IT
WHILE TRYING TO DO

23:05.330 --> 23:06.991
HER LINE DANCING
CLASSES.

23:07.030 --> 23:08.736
WHY WAS AN 87-YEAR-OLD WOMAN
WITH A BROKEN HIP

23:08.770 --> 23:09.930
ATTENDING A LINE DANCING CLASS?

23:09.970 --> 23:11.130
ATTENDING?

23:11.170 --> 23:13.274
SHE WAS TEACHING IT.

23:14.310 --> 23:15.675
YOU LEAVE MY GRANDSON ALONE!
HE'S A GOOD BOY!

23:15.720 --> 23:16.846
OH, YEAH?

23:16.890 --> 23:18.289
THEN WHY DID HE RUN
WHEN HE SAW US COMING?

23:18.320 --> 23:19.412
BECAUSE YOU GUYS
GOT MY FACE PLASTERED

23:19.460 --> 23:20.688
ALL OVER THE TV

23:20.730 --> 23:21.458
FOR SOMETHING
I DIDN'T DO, MAN.

23:21.490 --> 23:22.388
I'M INNOCENT!

23:22.430 --> 23:24.762
I DON'T EVEN THINK
ABOUT HER ANYMORE.

23:24.800 --> 23:26.233
YEAH, THAT'S WHAT
ALL CRAZY STALKERS SAY.

23:26.270 --> 23:27.464
STOP!

23:27.510 --> 23:30.343
JUST...

23:30.380 --> 23:32.314
STOP.
HEY, WHAT THE HELL?

23:32.350 --> 23:33.487
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
GET YOUR HAND OFF HIM.

23:33.520 --> 23:34.851
HE'S READING HIS GUILT.
GIVE HIM A SECOND.

23:34.890 --> 23:36.312
HOMINA...

23:36.360 --> 23:37.782
HOMINA, HOMINA,
HOMINA, HOMINA...

23:37.830 --> 23:39.457
RICKY, ENRIQUE...

23:39.500 --> 23:42.389
GERALDO, MENUDO...

23:42.440 --> 23:43.737
RICHIE!

23:43.770 --> 23:46.079
[GASPS]

23:50.220 --> 23:52.108
THIS MAN IS TRUE TO HIS WORD.

23:53.560 --> 23:54.959
HE IS PURE OF HEART.

23:56.200 --> 23:57.224
HE'S MADE...

23:57.270 --> 24:00.967
MANY MISTAKES IN HIS PAST--

24:01.010 --> 24:04.878
DIRTY, FILTHY MISTAKES.

24:04.910 --> 24:08.038
I'M NOT TELLING YOU ANYTHING
YOU DON'T ALREADY KNOW HERE.

24:08.090 --> 24:10.354
HE DIDN'T ATTACK DEANNA.

24:11.560 --> 24:12.720
REALLY.

24:14.100 --> 24:15.761
IF HE'S SO PURE OF HEART,

24:15.800 --> 24:17.199
WHY DID WE FIND THE TROPHY

24:17.240 --> 24:18.639
THAT SHE WAS NEARLY
BLUDGEONED TO DEATH WITH

24:18.680 --> 24:19.829
IN HIS CAR?

24:24.520 --> 24:25.509
[MOUTHS WORDS]

24:42.660 --> 24:44.787
THE RAVEN CROWS
ONLY AT MIDNIGHT.

24:44.830 --> 24:48.197
DUSK IS FOR
THE ROOSTER'S CACKLE.

24:48.240 --> 24:49.389
WHAT?

24:49.440 --> 24:50.429
JULES, THAT'S YOUR CUE
TO CACKLE.

24:50.470 --> 24:51.607
SHAWN, I DON'T HAVE
A CACKLE

24:51.640 --> 24:52.834
IN MY REPERTOIRE.

24:52.880 --> 24:54.074
WELL, YOU CALLED
FOR THIS SECRET MEETING.

24:54.110 --> 24:55.145
WE SHOULD USE CODE SPEAK

24:55.180 --> 24:56.169
IN CASE PEOPLE
ARE LISTENING.

24:56.220 --> 24:57.380
IT'S NOT SECRET.

24:57.420 --> 24:59.183
JUST AWAY
FROM PRYING EYES.

24:59.220 --> 25:00.414
SO, WHAT DO YOU PROPOSE?

25:00.460 --> 25:01.757
SHOULD WE RENT
ONE OF THOSE PEDAL BOATS

25:01.790 --> 25:02.757
THAT LOOKS LIKE A SWAN?

25:02.800 --> 25:02.993
WE COULD...

25:03.000 --> 25:04.968
OR...

25:05.000 --> 25:06.262
YOU COULD JUST TAKE THESE.

25:06.300 --> 25:08.871
WHAT IS THIS?

25:08.910 --> 25:10.343
COPIES OF THE FILES
ON FELIX ALVAREZ.

25:10.380 --> 25:12.371
WHY ARE YOU GIVING THESE TO ME?

25:12.420 --> 25:13.682
I TALKED TO THE KID,
HIS GRANDMOTHER,

25:13.720 --> 25:14.982
AND THE COURT-ORDERED
PSYCHIATRIST

25:15.020 --> 25:16.112
HE HAD TO SEE Al-TER BREAKING
INTO DEANNA'S HOUSE.

25:16.160 --> 25:17.149
THEY ALL SAY

25:17.190 --> 25:18.452
THE MONTHS OF COUNSELING
PAID OFF.

25:18.500 --> 25:19.524
HE WAS REHABILITATED.

25:19.560 --> 25:21.596
AND HE HAD
A MEDICAL CONDITION

25:21.640 --> 25:23.198
THAT REQUIRED DIALYSIS.

25:23.240 --> 25:25.435
MY GREAT AUNT NEEDED DIALYSIS,

25:25.470 --> 25:27.779
AND SHE WAS ALWAYS
KNOCK-DOWN, DRAG-OUT,

25:27.810 --> 25:29.516
WINTER-BEAR TIRED
AI-TERWARD.

25:29.550 --> 25:32.348
AND HIS LAST APPOINTMENT
PROBABLY LEI-T HIM

25:32.390 --> 25:35.689
WAY TOO "WINTER-BEAR TIRED"
TO STALK AND ATTACK DEANNA.

25:35.730 --> 25:36.958
EXACTLY.

25:37.000 --> 25:38.024
AND JUST WHAT DID
THE POLICE DO

25:38.070 --> 25:39.298
WHEN YOU FED THEM

25:39.340 --> 25:40.295
THIS PECULIAR PIECE
OF INFO GRISTLE?

25:40.340 --> 25:41.364
THEY SPIT IT OUT.

25:41.410 --> 25:42.638
IN FACT,

25:42.680 --> 25:44.102
THEY ARE SO CERTAIN
THAT HE IS THE GUY,

25:44.150 --> 25:46.209
THEY'VE TAKEN THE 24-HOUR GUARD
OFF DEANNA'S HOSPITAL ROOM.

25:54.100 --> 25:55.522
JULES, THAT'S NO GOOD.

25:55.570 --> 25:57.037
YOU GOT TO GET SECURITY
BACK ON THAT DOOR.

25:57.070 --> 25:58.537
THE KILLER WILL COME BACK.
HE'LL TRY AGAIN.

25:58.580 --> 25:59.638
AT THE VERY LEAST,

25:59.680 --> 26:01.238
HER DAD IS ALWAYS
BY HER BEDSIDE.

26:01.280 --> 26:02.372
HAVE YOU SEEN THAT DUDE?

26:02.420 --> 26:03.114
SHE NEEDS MORE SECURITY

26:03.120 --> 26:05.418
THAN A 60-YEAR-OLD
IN A TRACKSUIT.

26:05.460 --> 26:06.825
LOOK, WITHOUT PROTECTION,

26:06.860 --> 26:08.191
YOU MIGHT AS WELL JUST
SEND THE KILLER INVITATION

26:08.230 --> 26:09.959
SAYING, "HEY, COME ON BACK.
FINISH THE JOB."

26:10.000 --> 26:11.991
I WONDER IF THEY MAKE
INVITATIONS FOR THAT.

26:12.040 --> 26:13.507
I DON'T SEE WHY NOT.

26:13.540 --> 26:14.939
YOU CAN SEND AN E-VITE
FOR ANYTHING.

26:14.970 --> 26:16.130
THIS IS TRUE.

26:16.180 --> 26:17.374
LASSITER THINKS

26:17.410 --> 26:19.048
IT'S AN "INEFFICIENT USE
OF MANPOWER."

26:19.080 --> 26:20.149
I'LL SEE WHAT
I CAN DIVINE.

26:20.190 --> 26:21.339
WHAT'S THIS?

26:21.390 --> 26:22.357
THAT'S THE REST OF PAPERWORK

26:22.390 --> 26:23.584
ON FELIX'S FIRST BREAK-IN.

26:23.630 --> 26:25.086
I FIGURED YOU NEED
ALL THIS INFORMATION

26:25.130 --> 26:26.154
TO DO YOUR PSYCHIC...

26:26.200 --> 26:28.122
STU FF.

26:36.850 --> 26:38.044
I CAN FEEL
THESE TWO CRIMES

26:38.090 --> 26:39.910
WERE NOT COMMITTED
BY THE SAME PERSON,

26:39.960 --> 26:42.087
BUT, IN ORDER FOR YOUR
BROTHERS IN BLUE

26:42.130 --> 26:43.097
TO BE WRONG,

26:43.130 --> 26:44.688
WE'RE SAYING FELIX WAS FRAMED.

26:44.730 --> 26:46.368
WE'RE SAYING IT WAS SOMEBODY

26:46.400 --> 26:48.231
WHO KNEW HE'D BE TARGETED
BY THE POLICE.

26:48.280 --> 26:49.008
YOU'RE SAYING IT.

26:49.040 --> 26:50.348
I'M STEALTHILY LENDING AN EAR.

26:50.380 --> 26:52.974
I'M SAYING IT WAS AN EXCELLENT,
SLAM-DUNK FRAME-UP.

26:53.020 --> 26:54.715
THIS SOMEBODY
WAS A PRETTY BAD GUY.

26:54.750 --> 26:55.785
YES.

26:55.820 --> 26:56.787
UGLY ON THE INSIDE.

26:56.830 --> 26:57.785
THOUGHT OF EVERY DETAIL.

26:57.830 --> 26:59.297
A VIRTUAL...

26:59.330 --> 27:01.059
NCHBACKED MASTERMIND--
SHAWN.

27:01.100 --> 27:02.897
JUST LET ME KNOW
WHAT YOU FIND.

27:02.940 --> 27:04.999
REMEMBER, PSYCHIC INTUITION'S
NOT GOING TO HELP THIS GUY.

27:05.040 --> 27:06.177
EVIDENCE WILL.

27:06.210 --> 27:08.041
OH, AND ONE MORE THING.

27:08.080 --> 27:10.139
ROOSTERS DON'T CACKLE.

27:10.180 --> 27:11.147
I BEG YOUR PARDON?

27:11.190 --> 27:13.954
THEY COCK-A-DOODLE-DOO.

27:16.260 --> 27:17.488
YOU'RE KIDDING.
YOU DID NOT.

27:17.530 --> 27:18.497
40.

27:18.530 --> 27:19.736
40 YEARS OLD.

27:19.770 --> 27:21.101
OH, MAN...

27:21.140 --> 27:22.232
YOU LIKE THAT PAPRIKA IN THERE?

27:22.280 --> 27:23.508
THAT WAS TASTY.

27:23.540 --> 27:26.145
[CONVERSATION
CONTINUES]

27:27.290 --> 27:28.484
YOU HAVE GOT TO BE
KIDDING ME.

27:28.520 --> 27:29.589
SHAWN!

27:29.620 --> 27:30.382
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

27:30.420 --> 27:31.250
I DON'T KNOW.

27:31.290 --> 27:32.655
I GUESS I TOOK A WRONG TURN

27:32.700 --> 27:34.224
AND ENDED UP
IN THE TWILIGHT ZONE.

27:34.270 --> 27:35.362
WHAT THE HELL'S GOING ON HERE?

27:35.400 --> 27:37.504
WE CAUGHT US SOME LUNCH
THIS MORNING.

27:37.540 --> 27:39.269
HOOKED 'EM, COOKED 'EM,
AND ATE 'EM.

27:39.310 --> 27:40.675
HOW TRIBAL OF YOU.

27:40.710 --> 27:43.508
SHAWN NEVER REALLY WAS
ONE FOR ROUGHING IT.

27:43.550 --> 27:44.949
WE WENT CAMPING ONCE.

27:44.990 --> 27:46.582
FOUND HIM CURLED UP
INSIDE HIS SLEEPING BAG

27:46.620 --> 27:48.258
BECAUSE A RACCOON
WAS HUNTING HIM.

27:48.290 --> 27:50.190
STALKING ME.

27:50.230 --> 27:51.629
THE RACCOON
WAS STALKING ME, DAD.

27:51.670 --> 27:52.967
[LAUGHING]

27:53.000 --> 27:54.809
AND I CAME
TO TALK TO YOU.

27:54.840 --> 27:56.637
ALONE.

27:56.680 --> 27:57.647
ALRIGHTY.

27:57.680 --> 27:59.113
SO, WHAT'S WRONG?

27:59.150 --> 28:01.584
ALL RIGHT,
HERE'S THE THING--

28:01.620 --> 28:02.655
WHOA.

28:03.360 --> 28:05.123
WHY IS THERE A PICTURE
OF LASSITER

28:05.160 --> 28:06.297
ON YOUR REFRIGERATOR?

28:07.670 --> 28:09.137
THAT'S A PICTURE
OF THE FISH.

28:09.170 --> 28:11.661
I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW
HE WAS IN THERE.

28:11.710 --> 28:12.779
WHAT COULD YOU GUYS

28:12.810 --> 28:14.778
POSSIBLY TALK ABOUT
OUT THERE?

28:14.810 --> 28:16.914
SHAWN, THAT IS THE BEAUTY PART.

28:16.950 --> 28:18.178
NOTHING.

28:18.220 --> 28:19.414
HE KNOWS TO SIT THERE,
SHUT UP, AND FISH.

28:19.460 --> 28:20.757
WHAT,
YOU THINK WE SIT OUT THERE

28:20.790 --> 28:22.326
AND WE YAP
ABOUT YOU ALL DAY LONG?

28:22.360 --> 28:24.499
I CAN'T REALLY WRAP MY BRAIN
AROUND ANY OF IT.

28:24.530 --> 28:25.758
ALL RIGHT, SO...

28:25.800 --> 28:27.700
WHAT'S SO IMPORTANT?

28:27.740 --> 28:29.731
I'M WORKING ON A CASE...

28:32.820 --> 28:34.447
AND I KNOW THAT THEY'VE
ARRESTED THE WRONG GUY.

28:34.490 --> 28:35.912
WHAT MAKES YOU SO SURE?

28:35.960 --> 28:37.052
THE M.O.

28:37.090 --> 28:38.626
THIS GUY IN CUSTODY,

28:38.660 --> 28:40.298
HE TRASHES THE GIRL'S HOUSE,
TRASHES IT,

28:40.330 --> 28:41.695
THEN, THE APARTMENT

28:41.730 --> 28:42.765
WHERE THEY FIND HER

28:42.800 --> 28:44.859
IS PRACTICALLY
STERILE.

28:44.910 --> 28:46.537
I'M TALKING
ABOUT A PERFECT CRIME SCENE.

28:46.580 --> 28:47.706
BUT I CANNOT FIND ANYTHING
IN THESE POLICE REPORTS

28:47.750 --> 28:49.012
TO BACK ME UP.

28:49.050 --> 28:50.119
RIGHT THERE.
YOU SEE? RIGHT THERE.

28:50.150 --> 28:51.219
THAT'S YOUR FIRST PROBLEM.

28:51.250 --> 28:52.285
WHAT?

28:52.320 --> 28:53.685
THE POLICE REPORTS.

28:53.730 --> 28:54.788
SHAWN, A POLICE REPORT

28:54.830 --> 28:55.956
IS ALWAYS FROM
SOMEBODY ELSE'S

28:56.000 --> 28:57.353
POINT OF VIEW.

28:57.400 --> 28:58.560
I'VE WRITTEN THEM
A TON OF THEM MYSELF,

28:58.600 --> 28:59.897
AND ONE THING
YOU CANNOT DO

28:59.940 --> 29:01.134
IS TAKE THEM AS GOSPEL.

29:01.170 --> 29:03.479
ALL RIGHT?

29:03.480 --> 29:04.572
SO LET'S RUN THIS
AGAIN.

29:04.610 --> 29:05.577
YOU'VE BEEN TO BOTH
CRIME SCENES, RIGHT?

29:05.620 --> 29:07.838
RIGHT.

29:07.890 --> 29:09.312
WELL, THE FIRST ONE
WAS AFTER THE FACT,

29:09.360 --> 29:10.315
BUT I'VE BEEN TO BOTH PLACES,
YEAH.

29:10.360 --> 29:11.759
OKAY, SO...

29:11.800 --> 29:13.222
CLOSE YOUR EYES.

29:13.260 --> 29:14.625
DAD...

29:14.670 --> 29:16.228
I DIDN'T COME HERE
TO TAKE A STUPID TEST.

29:16.270 --> 29:17.601
CAN'T WE JUST TALK, AS MEN?

29:17.640 --> 29:18.629
SHAWN, WOULD YOU TRUST
YOUR OLD MAN FOR ONCE?

29:18.670 --> 29:21.173
JUST ONCE?

29:21.210 --> 29:23.269
CLOSE YOUR EYES.

29:23.320 --> 29:25.447
[SIGHS]

29:26.990 --> 29:27.957
HERE WE GO.

29:27.990 --> 29:29.218
ALL RIGHT, NOW,
I WANT YOU

29:29.260 --> 29:31.069
TO GO BACK
TO THE FIRST CRIME SCENE.

29:31.100 --> 29:32.465
THIS POOR GIRL'S HOUSE.

29:32.500 --> 29:33.603
WHAT DO YOU SEE?

29:33.640 --> 29:35.835
WHAT DO I SEE?

29:35.880 --> 29:36.869
HER BED.

29:38.510 --> 29:39.374
TENNIS TROPHIES.

29:39.420 --> 29:40.341
JEWELRY BOX.

29:40.380 --> 29:42.348
MOSTLY NICE JEWELRY.

29:42.390 --> 29:45.279
A WALL OF PHOTOS
FEATURING HER.

29:47.600 --> 29:48.669
COME ON.

29:48.700 --> 29:49.735
KEEP GOING.
KEEP GOING, SHAWN.

29:49.770 --> 29:50.907
WHAT ELSE?

29:50.940 --> 29:52.032
THERE IS NOTHING ELSE.

29:52.080 --> 29:53.399
THE GUY WAS THERE
WAY BEFORE ME.

29:53.440 --> 29:54.600
EVERYTHING LOOKS DIFFERENT NOW.

29:54.650 --> 29:56.345
OKAY, OKAY, NOW LET'S GO

29:56.380 --> 29:57.916
TO THE SECOND
CRIME SCENE.

29:57.950 --> 29:58.917
TO THIS APARTMENT

29:58.960 --> 30:00.052
WHERE SHE WAS FOUND.

30:00.090 --> 30:01.921
CAN WE STOP ON THE WAY
AND GET DONUTS?

30:01.960 --> 30:03.598
SHAWN, FOCUS.

30:03.600 --> 30:05.966
KEEP YOUR EYES CLOSED.

30:08.110 --> 30:09.429
WHAT DO YOU SEE?

30:23.000 --> 30:24.001
WAIT A MINUTE.

30:31.620 --> 30:33.554
[LAUGHS]

30:35.430 --> 30:37.660
THANK YOU, DAD.

30:37.700 --> 30:40.032
I HAVE A CRIME SCENE
TO BREAK INTO.

30:50.260 --> 30:52.990
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU PULLED ME OUT OF MY RETREAT.

30:53.030 --> 30:54.065
I CAN KISS MY CHANCES

30:54.100 --> 30:55.260
OF GETTING DR. FEELGOOD
ON MY ROUTE

30:55.300 --> 30:56.858
GOODBYE.

31:01.210 --> 31:03.519
GUS, WHAT TIME DO YOU HAVE?

31:03.550 --> 31:03.709
WHERE'S YOUR WATCH AT?

31:03.720 --> 31:06.553
IT'S A KEY TANNING MONTH.

31:08.090 --> 31:09.125
2:15.

31:09.160 --> 31:10.650
2:15...

31:10.700 --> 31:11.997
RIGHT.

31:12.040 --> 31:14.429
THAT'S AROUND THE SAME TIME
WE WERE HERE BEFORE.

31:15.880 --> 31:19.043
SO WHY ARE
ALL THESE CLOCKS WRONG?

31:19.080 --> 31:20.047
DUDE...

31:20.080 --> 31:21.786
I NEED YOU TO LAY ON THE GROUND.

31:21.820 --> 31:23.185
PRETEND LIKE
YOU'RE DEANNA.

31:23.220 --> 31:24.255
I'M NOT PRETENDING
TO BE A WOMAN

31:24.290 --> 31:25.450
HALF BEATEN
TO DEATH, SHAWN.

31:25.490 --> 31:26.752
YOU KNOW WHAT?

31:26.800 --> 31:28.165
I'M STARTING TO WONDER

31:28.200 --> 31:29.497
IF YOU HAVE SERIOUS TRUST ISSUES
WITH ME.

31:29.540 --> 31:31.064
REALLY?
YES.

31:31.110 --> 31:32.202
FIRST, YOU WOULDN'T DO
THE MINEFIELD.

31:32.240 --> 31:33.673
NOW YOU WON'T LAY ON THE FLOOR

31:33.710 --> 31:35.302
AND PRETEND TO BE
AN UNCONSCIOUS WOMAN FOR ME.

31:35.350 --> 31:36.612
WHAT'S GOING ON
WITH YOU?

31:36.650 --> 31:38.242
TWO WORDS.

31:38.290 --> 31:39.882
AIRWOLF WINDBREAKER.

31:39.920 --> 31:41.581
OKAY.

31:41.630 --> 31:42.619
TWO MORE.

31:42.660 --> 31:45.060
AIRWOLF... WINDBREAKER.

31:45.100 --> 31:46.362
BATTLESHIP.

31:46.400 --> 31:48.106
DUDE, THAT WAS LIKE
A MILLION YEARS AGO.

31:48.140 --> 31:49.209
I'M JUST SAYING.

31:49.240 --> 31:50.207
I NEVER CHEATED AGAIN.

31:50.240 --> 31:51.741
NOW, CAN WE PLEASE
JUST DO THIS?

31:51.780 --> 31:53.316
WHAT IS THE POINT OF ME
PRETENDING TO BE DEANNA?

31:53.350 --> 31:54.886
SOMETHING HERE
IS WEIRD, OKAY?

31:54.920 --> 31:56.057
WHEN I WAS WITH MY DAD,

31:56.090 --> 31:57.114
I REALIZED
THAT THE SHADOWS

31:57.160 --> 31:58.991
COMING OFF
THOSE TWO LAMPS

31:59.030 --> 32:00.554
WERE IN THE WRONG SPOTS.

32:00.600 --> 32:02.431
I THINK SOMEONE TAMPERED
WITH THIS CRIME SCENE.

32:02.470 --> 32:03.835
TAMP-- WHO COULD DO THAT?

32:03.840 --> 32:05.000
SOMEONE SMART.

32:05.040 --> 32:06.439
SOMEONE EXPERIENCED.

32:06.480 --> 32:07.970
WHICH IS WHY WE NEED
TO RECREATE THE SCENE

32:08.010 --> 32:09.113
SO THAT IT IS
EXACTLY THE WAY IT WAS

32:09.150 --> 32:10.117
WHEN THE COPS GOT HERE.

32:10.150 --> 32:11.788
ALL RIGHT, FINE.

32:11.820 --> 32:12.980
FINE.

32:13.020 --> 32:13.987
NOW,
IN THE LANDLORD'S STATEMENT,

32:14.030 --> 32:15.918
HE SAID THE BODY WAS FOUND HERE

32:15.960 --> 32:17.598
IN THE SUPINE POSITION,

32:17.630 --> 32:19.791
SO, PLEASE, IF YOU WILL...

32:19.840 --> 32:21.660
SURE. JUST...

32:21.710 --> 32:23.530
TELL ME WHAT SUPINE MEANS.

32:23.580 --> 32:25.172
GUS, SUPINE.

32:26.250 --> 32:27.478
SU...

32:27.520 --> 32:28.680
MM-HMM.

32:29.690 --> 32:30.611
PINE.

32:32.290 --> 32:33.450
YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT THE WORD MEANS, DO YOU?

32:33.500 --> 32:34.364
OKAY, FINE. YOU WIN.

32:34.400 --> 32:36.061
MR. VOCABULARY WINS.

32:36.100 --> 32:37.169
[CLAPPING]

32:37.200 --> 32:39.202
MR. VOCAB IS
THE BIG WINNER TONIGHT,

32:39.240 --> 32:40.434
EVERYBODY.

32:40.480 --> 32:41.845
THANK YOU.
NO, PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE.

32:41.880 --> 32:43.745
IT MEANS ON YOUR BACK.

32:47.220 --> 32:48.426
I KNEW THAT.

32:48.460 --> 32:50.257
NO, YOU DIDN'T.

32:51.830 --> 32:54.207
OKAY.

32:58.650 --> 33:01.414
THIS IS OFF.

33:02.720 --> 33:05.280
THE LAMP IS IN THE SAME SPOT,
BUT THE SHADOWS AREN'T.

33:07.030 --> 33:10.466
AND SOMETHING ELSE IS WRONG.

33:10.500 --> 33:12.274
THERE ARE SIX PICTURES
ON THIS BOOKSHELF.

33:12.310 --> 33:14.778
THERE ARE SIX PICTURES
IN THIS PHOTO.

33:14.810 --> 33:16.675
WHAT DO YOU EXPECT?

33:16.720 --> 33:18.017
SEVEN.

33:18.050 --> 33:19.950
I CLEARLY REMEMBER
SEVEN PHOTOS, GUS.

33:19.990 --> 33:21.287
THERE WERE TWO PICTURES
ON EACH SHELF,

33:21.330 --> 33:23.753
AND ONE SHELF WITH ONE.

33:23.800 --> 33:24.892
THAT'S SEVEN.

33:26.270 --> 33:29.137
IT WAS RIGHT HERE,
WHERE THIS BOX IS.

33:29.180 --> 33:31.045
CAN YOU REMEMBER
WHAT'S IN THE MISSING PHOTO?

33:35.350 --> 33:37.682
I'M NOT...

33:37.730 --> 33:40.153
SURE.

33:45.210 --> 33:46.677
WHAT THE HELL'S
GOING ON?

33:46.710 --> 33:47.677
NOTHING, MAN.

33:47.710 --> 33:48.904
NOTHING?

33:48.950 --> 33:50.508
IS THAT GUY DEAD?

33:50.550 --> 33:51.744
DAMN IT.

33:51.790 --> 33:53.212
NOW YOU'VE SEEN TOO MUCH.

33:53.260 --> 33:54.818
I... I DIDN'T SEE ANYTHING.

33:54.860 --> 33:56.020
YEAH, YOU DID.

33:56.060 --> 33:57.596
YOU'RE IN THIS
JUST AS DEEP AS I AM NOW.

34:00.000 --> 34:01.137
OKAY.

34:01.170 --> 34:02.728
I ASSUME THIS BUILDING HAS
AN INCINERATOR.

34:02.780 --> 34:04.077
YEAH.
OKAY.

34:04.080 --> 34:06.310
SO WE JUST HAVE TO
CHOP UP THE BODY,

34:06.350 --> 34:08.386
AND WE PUT THE LIMBS
IN LITTLE PLASTIC BAGGIES.

34:08.420 --> 34:09.489
THE TORSO WE'RE GOING TO
HAVE TO MELT DOWN

34:09.520 --> 34:10.487
WITH A BLOWTORCH--

34:10.520 --> 34:11.555
OKAY, I'VE HEARD ENOUGH.

34:11.590 --> 34:13.319
OH!

34:14.730 --> 34:16.061
"CHOP UP HIS BODY"?

34:16.100 --> 34:16.964
AND THEN YOU WONDER
WHY I DON'T TRUST YOU.

34:18.710 --> 34:19.631
ARE WE DONE YET?

34:19.680 --> 34:21.705
ONE LAST THING.

34:25.750 --> 34:27.081
HURRY UP, SHAWN.

34:42.590 --> 34:43.989
SHAWN, I LEI-T MY RETREAT
TO SOLVE A CRIME,

34:44.020 --> 34:45.328
NOT TO ORDER TAKEOUT.

34:45.360 --> 34:46.520
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT WE'RE DOING.

34:46.560 --> 34:47.891
HI THERE.

34:47.930 --> 34:49.192
WHAT TIME DO YOU TURN
THOSE LIGHTS ON?

34:49.240 --> 34:51.834
AT 5:00, FOR THE BEGINNING
OF THE DINNER CROWD.

34:51.870 --> 34:53.007
NEVER ANY EARLIER,

34:53.040 --> 34:54.405
FOR ANY REASON
WHATSOEVER?

34:54.450 --> 34:56.247
IT'S ON A TIMER.

34:56.280 --> 34:57.645
WHAT THE HELL
IS THE POINT?

34:57.690 --> 34:59.214
I THINK I KNOW
WHO THE KILLER IS.

34:59.260 --> 35:02.149
ONE MORE QUESTION,
AND THIS IS ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL.

35:05.400 --> 35:10.406
DO YOUR SAMOSAS COME
WITH THAT RED ONION CHUTNEY?

35:12.310 --> 35:13.868
I ARRAIGN FELIX TODAY.

35:13.920 --> 35:15.182
IF HE'S SMART,
HE'LL JUST PLEAD OUT.

35:15.220 --> 35:16.983
SO NEXT IS...

35:17.020 --> 35:18.920
JIMINY CRICKETS.
WHAT?

35:18.960 --> 35:20.757
HE'S SENSING
AN ANOMALY

35:20.800 --> 35:21.869
IN THE SPACE-TIME
CONTINUUM.

35:21.900 --> 35:23.265
IT'S VERY SERIOUS.

35:23.300 --> 35:24.528
IT CAN UNRAVEL THE FABRIC
OF REALITY ITSELF.

35:24.570 --> 35:25.798
WE'VE BEEN TRAILING IT
FROM ACROSS TOWN.

35:25.840 --> 35:27.637
THE DISTORTION IS NEAR.

35:29.110 --> 35:30.270
[SNEEZES]

35:30.320 --> 35:31.139
BLESS YOU.

35:31.180 --> 35:32.317
THANK YOU.

35:32.360 --> 35:33.759
IT'S IN THE PHOTOS
IN THE FILES!

35:37.100 --> 35:38.055
YES.

35:38.100 --> 35:40.295
THE PHOTOS
ARE LYING.

35:40.340 --> 35:42.069
THAT IS THE ANOMALY.

35:42.110 --> 35:44.499
IT WAS THE DISTORTION
THAT PREVENTED ME

35:44.550 --> 35:46.074
FROM DIVINING
DIRTY DEANNA'S ATTACKER,

35:46.110 --> 35:47.839
BUT NOW...

35:47.890 --> 35:49.141
NOW I HAVE A CLEAR IMAGE.

35:49.190 --> 35:50.589
WE ALREADY KNOW
WHO ATTACKED HER.

35:50.620 --> 35:52.019
HE'S RIGHT, MR. SPENCER.

35:52.060 --> 35:53.129
HE'S WRONG.

35:54.830 --> 35:56.866
THE BLUDGEONER'S CLOSE.

35:57.840 --> 35:59.728
FOLLOW ME.

36:09.430 --> 36:11.364
YES... NO. NO.

36:12.840 --> 36:13.864
[GASPS]

36:15.070 --> 36:17.436
AAH!

36:17.480 --> 36:19.277
BLUDGEONER.

36:19.320 --> 36:20.275
WHAT ARE YOU, NUTS?

36:20.320 --> 36:21.309
HE WORKS FOR US.

36:23.190 --> 36:24.179
THE PHOTOS...

36:24.230 --> 36:25.356
LOOK AT THE PHOTOS.

36:25.390 --> 36:26.391
JULES, JULES, JULES.

36:26.430 --> 36:27.465
WHAT'S GOING ON
WITH THE LIGHTS

36:27.500 --> 36:28.467
IN THE BACKGROUND
OF THE WINDOW?

36:28.500 --> 36:29.467
OH, HE'S RIGHT.

36:29.500 --> 36:30.637
THE LIGHTS
IN THE RESTAURANT

36:30.670 --> 36:31.659
ARE ON
IN THESE PHOTOS.

36:31.710 --> 36:32.972
THEY WERE OFF
WHEN WE FOUND DEANNA.

36:33.010 --> 36:33.977
WHAT?

36:34.010 --> 36:35.238
THIS IS CRAZY.

36:35.280 --> 36:37.316
WHY WOULD I ATTACK SOME WOMAN
I'VE NEVER MET BEFORE?

36:37.350 --> 36:38.339
NEVER MET?
DIDN'T YOU PHOTOGRAPH HER HOUSE

36:38.390 --> 36:39.652
WHEN THE FELIX GUY BROKE IN?

36:39.690 --> 36:40.952
[SHAWN]: THAT'S
WHEN YOU MET HER!

36:40.990 --> 36:42.423
OH, DUDE...

36:42.460 --> 36:44.018
SHE LIKED MEETING NEW PEOPLE,
SHE LIKED TO PARTY,

36:44.060 --> 36:45.459
AND SHE LIKED TO HAVE
HER PHOTO TAKEN,

36:45.500 --> 36:46.831
AND GUESS WHO TAKES PHOTOS
FOR A LIVING.

36:46.870 --> 36:47.859
YOU!

36:47.910 --> 36:49.502
AND IT WAS NICE,
AND IT WAS ON,

36:49.540 --> 36:51.007
AND YOU WERE
GIVING IT TO HER,

36:51.040 --> 36:52.143
AND SHE LIKED IT,

36:52.180 --> 36:53.647
UNTIL SHE MET SOMEBODY

36:53.680 --> 36:56.217
WHO COULD AFFORD TO BUY HER
NICER JEWELRY THAN YOU.

36:56.250 --> 36:57.751
SHE WAS ON HER WAY
TO SEE HIM IN TOKYO.

36:57.790 --> 36:58.984
YOU DECIDED TO CONFRONT HER

36:59.030 --> 37:00.190
AT HER APARTMENT.

37:00.230 --> 37:02.892
HEY! TROPHY! BAM!

37:06.380 --> 37:08.302
BAM.

37:09.850 --> 37:11.715
AND THEN
YOU CLEANED IT ALL UP...

37:14.460 --> 37:15.757
AND YOU MADE IT NICE,

37:15.790 --> 37:17.223
AND YOU LEI-T

37:17.260 --> 37:18.329
A PERFECT CRIME SCENE,

37:18.370 --> 37:19.792
AND YOU CAME BACK HERE

37:19.840 --> 37:20.989
AND ASSUMED YOUR CAPACITY
AS POLICE PHOTOGRAPHER.

37:22.670 --> 37:24.809
YOU SCRUTINIZED THE PHOTOS,

37:24.850 --> 37:27.444
MAKING SURE THERE WAS NO TRACE
OF YOUR PRESENCE

37:27.480 --> 37:29.016
IN THAT APARTMENT.

37:29.050 --> 37:30.915
WHOOPS. WHOA.

37:30.960 --> 37:31.927
OVERSIGHT.

37:31.960 --> 37:33.427
THIS BAG...

37:33.460 --> 37:34.927
SURE ENOUGH,

37:34.970 --> 37:37.097
IN A PHOTO
ON HER BOOKSHELF.

37:37.140 --> 37:38.539
YOUR BAG WITH YOUR INITIALS

37:38.570 --> 37:39.537
THAT THE POLICE HAVE SEEN
A MILLION TIMES.

37:39.580 --> 37:40.330
THEY'D HAVE KNOWN IT WAS YOU.

37:40.380 --> 37:41.506
SO, WHAT DID YOU DO?

37:41.550 --> 37:43.017
YOU WAITED
FOR THE FORENSICS GUYS TO SPLIT,

37:43.050 --> 37:44.017
AND YOU SNUCK BACK INSIDE.

37:44.050 --> 37:46.382
OH, YOU WERE SO METICULOUS.

37:46.420 --> 37:47.887
YOU TOOK THE TIME

37:47.920 --> 37:50.627
TO TURN THE CLOCKS BACK
TO THE RIGHT TIME,

37:50.660 --> 37:52.196
AND YOU RE-PHOTOGRAPHED
THE WHOLE SCENE

37:52.230 --> 37:54.460
WITHOUT
THE INCRIMINATING PHOTO,

37:54.500 --> 37:57.037
AND YOU RE-SUBMITTED THOSE
AS THE ORIGINALS.

37:58.910 --> 38:00.172
BUT I CAN FEEL THAT YOU FORGOT

38:00.220 --> 38:02.484
TO RESET THE CLOCKS
TO THE CORRECT TIME

38:02.520 --> 38:04.010
BEFORE LEAVING.

38:08.770 --> 38:09.759
[WEAKLY]: GUS...

38:16.080 --> 38:17.240
TAKE HIM INTO CUSTODY

38:17.280 --> 38:19.851
UNTIL WE FIGURE
THIS WHOLE THING OUT.

38:28.210 --> 38:29.677
SO...

38:29.710 --> 38:31.234
THE PROPHECY'S
BEEN FULFILLED.

38:31.280 --> 38:33.373
MM.

38:33.420 --> 38:34.375
WHAT?

38:34.420 --> 38:35.387
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

38:35.420 --> 38:36.387
WHAT PROPHECY?

38:36.420 --> 38:37.785
NOTHING.

38:37.830 --> 38:38.888
I JUST FIGURED IT WAS
FINALLY MY CHANCE

38:38.930 --> 38:40.659
TO SAY SOMETHING DRAMATIC.

38:48.450 --> 38:50.077
FIRE!

38:50.320 --> 38:51.947
HEY, POP!

38:51.990 --> 38:53.457
SHAWN, GOD-- GOD!

38:53.490 --> 38:55.082
WHAT, ARE YOU SLEEPING ONE OFF?

38:55.130 --> 38:56.529
NO.

38:56.560 --> 38:57.720
I COULDN'T SLEEP LAST NIGHT.

38:57.770 --> 38:59.829
MY BACK'S ALL OUT OF WHACK.

38:59.870 --> 39:02.202
[GRU NTS]

39:02.240 --> 39:06.643
HEY, I HEAR THEY ARRESTED
ONE OF THE FORENSICS GUYS, HUH?

39:06.680 --> 39:07.647
YEP.

39:07.680 --> 39:08.886
THEY GRILLED HIM LIKE PANINI.

39:08.920 --> 39:09.989
HE CONFESSED TO THE WHOLE THING.

39:10.020 --> 39:11.385
AND THE POLICE FOUND

39:11.420 --> 39:13.695
A FAKE HOSPITAL BADGE
AT HIS APARTMENT.

39:13.730 --> 39:15.595
THEY THINK HE WAS GOING TO TRY
TO KILL HER LAST NIGHT.

39:15.630 --> 39:17.188
HOW'S THE GIRL?

39:17.240 --> 39:19.333
THE DOCTORS SAY
SHE'S GOING TO PULL THROUGH.

39:19.370 --> 39:21.099
THERE HE IS.

39:21.140 --> 39:23.472
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO GO OUT
LIKE THAT, ARE YOU?

39:23.520 --> 39:24.418
YEAH.

39:24.450 --> 39:25.439
I CAN'T MAKE IT TONIGHT.

39:25.490 --> 39:27.378
I'VE GOT TO
WORK A DOUBLE.

39:27.420 --> 39:28.580
I KNOW.

39:28.630 --> 39:29.927
WHY DON'T YOU TAKE JUNIOR HERE?

39:29.960 --> 39:30.824
I'LL CATCH YOU
NEXT WEEK.

39:30.860 --> 39:31.724
WHOA.

39:31.770 --> 39:33.192
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

39:33.240 --> 39:34.298
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

39:34.340 --> 39:36.535
DIDN'T YOU JUST WORK
BACK-TO-BACK SHIFTS

39:36.570 --> 39:37.730
ON THAT TENNIS THING?

39:37.780 --> 39:38.769
OKAY, FINE.

39:38.810 --> 39:39.811
YOU GOT ME,
ALL RIGHT?

39:39.850 --> 39:41.386
HE'S ACTUALLY CAPABLE

39:41.420 --> 39:43.115
OF TAKING ALL THE FUN
OUT OF FISHING.

39:43.150 --> 39:44.788
HE CRITICIZED
MY POLE TECHNIQUE

39:44.830 --> 39:46.081
FOR LIKE THREE HOURS.

39:46.130 --> 39:47.324
IT'S HOLDING A POLE
IN THE WATER.

39:47.360 --> 39:48.327
WHAT IS THERE
TO CRITICIZE?

39:48.370 --> 39:49.439
HEY. EASE UP.

39:49.470 --> 39:50.937
THAT'S MY POP
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

39:50.970 --> 39:53.530
I'M BEGINNING TO UNDERSTAND YOU
A LITTLE BETTER, SPENCER.

39:57.680 --> 39:59.819
BURTON. YOU'RE BACK.

39:59.860 --> 40:01.259
SORRY I MISSED
TODAY'S PROGRAM, SIR.

40:01.290 --> 40:03.292
WELL, IT'S OKAY.

40:03.330 --> 40:04.797
I TRIED OUT
A NEW TRUST EXERCISE

40:04.800 --> 40:07.337
WHERE I PULL A RUBBER BAND BACK
AS FAR AS I CAN,

40:07.370 --> 40:08.564
AND I HOLD IT UP
TO MY TRUST PARTNER'S EYE,

40:08.610 --> 40:09.577
AND I SAY,

40:09.610 --> 40:11.100
"DO YOU TRUST ME?
DO YOU TRUST ME?"

40:11.140 --> 40:13.176
WOW.
HOW DID THAT GO?

40:14.450 --> 40:15.917
I WISH MY GRIP WAS BETTER.

40:16.960 --> 40:18.018
BUT...

40:18.060 --> 40:19.084
THE CORNEA IS RESILIENT.

40:19.130 --> 40:20.427
THAT'S TRUE, TOM.

40:20.460 --> 40:21.427
I'VE HEARD THAT.

40:21.460 --> 40:23.496
NOW, BURTON HERE HATES TO DRAG

40:23.540 --> 40:24.529
HIS PERSONAL LIFE
INTO WORK MATTERS,

40:24.570 --> 40:27.368
BUT I FEEL
LIKE YOU SHOULD KNOW

40:27.410 --> 40:29.048
HIS DEAR GRANDMOTHER
SOMEHOW MANAGED

40:29.080 --> 40:30.968
TO DISLOCATE
BOTH OF HER SHOULDERS, TOO.

40:31.020 --> 40:33.181
I THINK IT WAS THE CHIN-UPS
SHE WAS TRYING TO DO

40:33.220 --> 40:34.653
ON THE TRACTION BAR.

40:34.690 --> 40:37.227
BURTON, YOU HAVE MISSED ALMOST
EVERY EXERCISE

40:37.260 --> 40:38.591
WE HAD ARRANGED
FOR THIS WEEKEND.

40:38.630 --> 40:40.769
YOU LEFT
A WORK FUNCTION

40:40.800 --> 40:42.165
TO TEND
TO YOUR AILING GRANDMOTHER,

40:42.210 --> 40:44.098
EVEN IF IT WAS DETRIMENTAL
TO YOUR CAREER.

40:44.140 --> 40:45.971
YOU KNOW
WHAT THAT TELLS ME?

40:46.010 --> 40:47.477
IT TELLS ME YOU REALLY
CARE ABOUT PEOPLE.

40:47.520 --> 40:49.613
I DO.
HE DOES.

40:49.660 --> 40:51.013
AND AFTER GETTING IN TOUCH
WITH MY FEELINGS THIS WEEKEND,

40:51.060 --> 40:52.288
I THINK THAT'S EXACTLY

40:52.330 --> 40:53.524
WHAT THE CENTRAL COAST
PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANY

40:53.560 --> 40:54.527
IS ALL ABOUT.

40:54.570 --> 40:55.798
OKAY.
YES.

40:55.830 --> 40:57.866
AND...

40:57.900 --> 40:59.800
LOOK, BURTON'S GRANDMOTHER'S
GOING TO NEED

40:59.840 --> 41:00.909
A LITTLE EXTRA CARING AFTER.

41:00.940 --> 41:02.202
HE WOULD NEVER COMPLAIN,

41:02.250 --> 41:03.308
BECAUSE I KNOW
HE LOVES THIS JOB,

41:03.350 --> 41:04.442
BUT IF THERE WAS ANY WAY

41:04.490 --> 41:04.910
THAT HIS ROUTE COULD BE
A LITTLE LESS--

41:04.920 --> 41:06.558
SAVE YOUR BREATH.

41:06.590 --> 41:08.057
BURTON...

41:08.090 --> 41:11.093
I KNOW THAT EVERYBODY HERE
WANTS TO GET DR. MAGNOTTI.

41:11.130 --> 41:12.267
WHY DON'T YOU
SWAP HIM OUT

41:12.300 --> 41:14.564
FOR A COUPLE OF YOUR
LESS-PRODUCT IVE CLIENTS.

41:14.600 --> 41:16.101
OH, WOW. WOW.

41:16.140 --> 41:17.402
THANK YOU, TOM.

41:17.440 --> 41:18.441
MY GRANDMOTHER
THANKS YOU,

41:18.480 --> 41:19.549
AS A MATTER OF FACT.

41:19.580 --> 41:20.740
WELL, I TELL YOU WHAT--

41:20.780 --> 41:21.986
ONCE SHE'S
FEELING BETTER,

41:22.020 --> 41:23.556
I WANT YOU TWO
TO COME ON OVER TO MY HOUSE

41:23.590 --> 41:24.716
AND HAVE DINNER
WITH MY WIFE AND I.

41:25.960 --> 41:27.120
OH... NO...

41:27.160 --> 41:28.627
NO, WE COULDN'T.
WE COULDN'T.

41:28.670 --> 41:30.297
LIZZY MAKES A FONDUE
THAT'LL KNOCK YOUR SOCKS OFF.

41:30.340 --> 41:31.864
BLOCK OF CHEESE
ABOUT THE SIZE OF A HOUSE CAT.

41:31.900 --> 41:34.403
WE'RE GOING TO MELT IT DOWN
AND GOBBLE IT UP.

41:34.440 --> 41:35.577
OKAY.
ALL RIGHT.

41:35.610 --> 41:36.907
YEAH, SURE.
WE'D BE HONORED.

41:36.950 --> 41:38.247
AND DON'T BE
SUCH A STRANGER.

41:38.280 --> 41:39.440
HELLO, TOM!

41:39.490 --> 41:41.981
HELLO!

41:42.030 --> 41:42.985
I'M SO SCREWED.

41:43.030 --> 41:43.951
HE WANTS TO MEET
MY GRANDMOTHER.

41:44.000 --> 41:45.365
SO?

41:45.400 --> 41:47.163
YOU KNOW ONE OF THEM IS DEAD
AND THE OTHER ONE'S IN JAMAICA.

41:47.200 --> 41:48.167
DUDE, RELAX.

41:48.210 --> 41:49.404
I KNOW LIKE FIVE PEOPLE

41:49.440 --> 41:50.998
THAT COULD EASILY PLAY
YOUR GRANDMOTHER.

41:51.040 --> 41:52.871
OKAY, SO YOU KNOW
A LINE-DANCING OCT OGENARIAN

41:52.910 --> 41:54.218
WHO COULD DO CHIN-UPS
AND HAS TWO BROKEN HIPS?

41:54.250 --> 41:55.740
YEAH, AS LONG AS
SHE CAN BE CHINESE.

41:55.790 --> 41:56.779
OH...

41:56.820 --> 41:58.356
JUST TRUST ME.
NEVER MIND.

41:58.390 --> 41:59.459
WHOA, WHOA,
WHOA, WHOA.

41:59.490 --> 42:00.627
YOU DO TRUST ME,
RIGHT?

42:00.660 --> 42:01.695
I MEAN, I KNOW IT'S
A SILLY THING TO SAY

42:01.730 --> 42:03.027
AFTER ALL THESE YEARS,

42:03.070 --> 42:05.038
BUT WE DON'T HAVE TO DO
THESE KINDS OF EXERCISES...

42:05.040 --> 42:06.598
DO WE?

42:06.640 --> 42:08.107
BATTLESHIP REMATCH?

42:08.150 --> 42:09.469
YOU KNOW
THAT'S RIGHT.

42:10.820 --> 42:13.584
[***]

42:17.830 --> 42:21.266
* IN BETWEEN THE LINES
THERE'S A LOT OF OBSCURITY *

42:21.300 --> 42:24.599
* I'M NOT INCLINED
TO RESIGN TO MATURITY *

42:24.650 --> 42:28.142
* IF IT'S ALL RIGHT
THEN YOU'RE ALL WRONG *

42:28.190 --> 42:31.978
* BUT WHY BOUNCE AROUND
TO THE SAME DAMN SONG? *

42:32.020 --> 42:36.992
* YOU'D RATHER RUN
WHEN YOU CAN CRAWL *

42:39.440 --> 42:42.841
* I KNOW YOU KNOW
THAT I'M NOT TELLING THE TRUTH *

42:42.880 --> 42:45.815
* I KNOW YOU KNOW
THEY JUST DON'T HAVE ANY PROOF *

42:45.850 --> 42:48.785
* EMBRACE THE DECEPTION
LEARN HOW TO BEND *

42:48.830 --> 42:50.491
* YOUR WORST INHIBITIONS

42:50.530 --> 42:53.067
* THEY WILL PSYCH YOU OUT
IN THE END *

42:53.100 --> 42:56.433
