00:08.943 --> 00:10.510
<i>We return to live coverage</i>

00:10.511 --> 00:13.080
<i>of the March for Our Lives
in Washington,</i>

00:13.081 --> 00:14.681
<i>and it appears that President Trump</i>

00:14.682 --> 00:17.284
<i>has found an unsupervised microphone.</i>

00:17.285 --> 00:19.152
Hello, students!

00:19.153 --> 00:21.354
It's so moving that
you came all this way

00:21.355 --> 00:23.957
to celebrate Vladimir Putin's victory,

00:23.958 --> 00:25.959
and I'm sure some of you are here

00:25.960 --> 00:28.361
to express your opposition
to being shot.

00:28.362 --> 00:31.364
No one empathizes
with this issue more than me

00:31.365 --> 00:34.266
because after my fifth meal
and 30th diet Coke,

00:34.267 --> 00:36.502
I feel like I've been
shot in the stomach.

00:36.503 --> 00:40.706
That's why several weeks ago,
I became the first Republican

00:40.707 --> 00:45.278
to propose common-sense gun reforms,
and then not two minutes later,

00:45.279 --> 00:49.281
NRA chief Wayne LaPierre
kicked my door off its hinges

00:49.282 --> 00:51.484
and threatened to remove my organs.

00:51.485 --> 00:54.052
And in that moment,
coincidentally, I thought,

00:54.053 --> 00:57.122
"This issue is not
that important to me!"

00:57.123 --> 00:59.858
But there is one issue I'll die for ...

00:59.859 --> 01:02.327
ending the Russia investigation.

01:02.328 --> 01:03.795
Everyone's wondering ...

01:03.796 --> 01:06.698
will Donald Trump fire
special counsel Robert Mueller?

01:06.699 --> 01:10.635
Let me just reassure the American
people I'm going to fire him.

01:10.636 --> 01:12.970
You're smart kids, so I need your help.

01:12.971 --> 01:15.006
Turn your attention to the screens

01:15.007 --> 01:18.410
for a star-studded
public-service announcement.

01:18.411 --> 01:21.413
Hey, kids. It's DJT.

01:21.414 --> 01:23.381
There's problems in the streets...

01:23.382 --> 01:25.216
Facebook jackin' your stats...

01:25.217 --> 01:28.185
George Soros bribing you
to be crisis actors.

01:28.186 --> 01:29.987
But you know
what's really messed up?

01:29.988 --> 01:32.636
<i>- Robert Mueller.
- # Robert Mueller #</i>

01:32.671 --> 01:35.192
He wants to lock me up
just for being myself.

01:35.193 --> 01:37.394
So it's time to show him what's up.

01:37.395 --> 01:40.264
A week from Monday, we're
going to walk out of school

01:40.265 --> 01:42.786
and proclaim that we want
to fire Robert Mueller.

01:42.821 --> 01:44.568
<i>♪ Fire Robert Mueller ♪</i>

01:44.569 --> 01:47.104
- Fire Robert Mueller.
- We need to act.

01:47.105 --> 01:50.340
- It ends today.
- Robert Mueller's super poor.

01:50.341 --> 01:51.708

02:07.790 --> 02:10.926
<b>1x08 - Government Shutdown</b>

02:17.143 --> 02:19.312
Sir, I'm serving
as a character witness

02:19.313 --> 02:22.147
for seven White House staffers
being tried in family court.

02:22.148 --> 02:24.850
Could you sign this good-luck
card for the last staff secretary?

02:24.851 --> 02:26.319
We let him go after it leaked

02:26.320 --> 02:28.087
he had done his fair share
of dog strangling.

02:28.088 --> 02:30.489
While I'm gone,
McMaster's in charge.

02:30.490 --> 02:33.225
I'd say you're in charge,
but you lost that privilege

02:33.226 --> 02:35.660
when you asked what the "R"
in "Argentina" stands for.

02:35.661 --> 02:38.831
And while he's gone, we get to
lock down a budget resolution!

02:38.832 --> 02:41.566
How's that sound?
Sir?

02:41.567 --> 02:42.935
I don't know where he is!

02:42.936 --> 02:44.770
Uh, maybe look for a sausage patty

02:44.771 --> 02:46.504
that compliments whoever's eating it.

02:46.505 --> 02:48.707
I'll tell Sanders to
give this a positive spin

02:48.708 --> 02:51.543
and say the president's
throwing pork at refugees.

02:51.544 --> 02:53.545
Hold off.
He won't get far.

02:53.846 --> 02:57.515
Airplane! KFC drive-through!
And step on it!

02:57.516 --> 02:59.183
For all General Kelly knows,

02:59.184 --> 03:02.754
I'm still at my desk with
a basketball on my head!

03:02.755 --> 03:04.789
- Damn it!
- There's no pilot.

03:04.790 --> 03:07.625
I thought you'd try this, so I
told him you were into trains now.

03:07.626 --> 03:10.061
I'm not dealing with this
stupid budget resolution bill.

03:10.062 --> 03:12.529
I mean, it's got "stupid"
right there in the title.

03:12.530 --> 03:14.799
How about this?
After you close a budget deal,

03:14.800 --> 03:17.802
we'll have KFC delivered
right to your larynx.

03:17.803 --> 03:19.403
It's not about the food.

03:19.404 --> 03:22.139
It's about the whole
drive-through experience.

03:22.140 --> 03:24.107
Will there be a monitor
that displays your order?

03:24.108 --> 03:25.942
Will there be one window or two?

03:25.943 --> 03:27.444
How will the bad grease taste?

03:27.445 --> 03:29.480
Sir, I know this is controversial,

03:29.481 --> 03:32.082
and I believe the federal
government should be funded,

03:32.083 --> 03:33.450
so I have to put my foot down.

03:33.451 --> 03:38.193
Your foot never lets me do anything!

03:38.611 --> 03:40.924
Well, of course, any discussion...

03:40.925 --> 03:43.160
...of raising federal spending
caps is a non-starter.

03:43.161 --> 03:44.961
- Okay. Mmm-mmhmm.
- And our caucus won't even

03:44.962 --> 03:47.264
discuss the FISA surveillance program.

03:47.265 --> 03:50.466
Ugh! Shut up!
This is so boring.

03:50.467 --> 03:52.102
I could be blasting
chicken down my throat

03:52.103 --> 03:54.070
with a Civil War cannon right now.

03:54.071 --> 03:57.173
Hey, we're the Democrats.
We're the fun ones.

03:57.174 --> 03:59.776
Just the other day,
Nancy switched my pen.

03:59.777 --> 04:02.478
I was like, "This isn't my pen."

04:02.479 --> 04:05.481
And she was like, "Gotcha.
I switched our pens."

04:05.482 --> 04:07.016
Don't you guys ever
want to have fun?

04:07.017 --> 04:08.984
Like, start a football league
that cuts the players'

04:08.985 --> 04:12.188
- life expectancy in half?
- We do fun stuff ...

04:12.189 --> 04:14.924
e-mail donors, call donors,

04:14.925 --> 04:17.492
call donors to make sure
they got our e-mail.

04:17.493 --> 04:20.696
So far, nothing you've said is fun,
except maybe that pen thing.

04:20.697 --> 04:23.291
Call me when this bill
has some pizzazz in it, or ...

04:23.326 --> 04:25.367
or pizzas! Either one.
No! Wait! Both!

04:27.650 --> 04:30.171
<i>Oh, come on!
Where is it?!</i>

04:30.172 --> 04:34.309
I specifically told the cable guy
to make Fox News every channel!

04:34.310 --> 04:36.177
Did you finish your big bill yet?

04:36.178 --> 04:38.980
Oh, great. Now you're
nagging me about my job?

04:38.981 --> 04:41.972
What, did everyone read the
Constitution all of a sudden?

04:42.127 --> 04:43.271
<i>Strap your kids
into their beds, folks.</i>

04:43.272 --> 04:44.339
<i>We got a great one tonight.</i>

04:44.340 --> 04:46.841
- Hi, Sean! Sean! It's me!
- Hannity!

04:46.842 --> 04:49.077
<i>He's an up-and-coming
conservative voice.</i>

04:49.078 --> 04:51.645
<i>Please welcome the first
registered Republican toddler.</i>

04:51.646 --> 04:52.947
<i>Connor Smith, it's an honor.</i>

04:52.948 --> 04:56.184
How has Hannity not won
a single award ever?

04:56.185 --> 04:59.653
<i>Why is the deep state so
goo-goo-gah-gah about supporting ISIS?</i>

04:59.654 --> 05:01.355
<i>Can you tell me that?
Can you talk?</i>

05:01.356 --> 05:04.191
Oh, wow.
That kid's got it made.

05:04.192 --> 05:07.862
No meetings. No reading.
People cheer when he dances.

05:07.863 --> 05:10.197
So act like a toddler.
You're the Commander-in-Chief.

05:10.198 --> 05:12.699
- You can do whatever you want.
- No, I can't!

05:12.734 --> 05:14.034
General Kelly...
you'll get married me.

05:14.035 --> 05:15.369
It's like he's my dad,

05:15.370 --> 05:17.770
except he doesn't refer to
padlocks as babysitters.

05:17.971 --> 05:21.674
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
this is an important decision,</i>

05:21.675 --> 05:24.478
one historians will
forever write about.

05:24.479 --> 05:26.490
So, what do we think?

05:27.388 --> 05:29.483
Hell-o-o-o?
How do you think Entenmann's

05:29.484 --> 05:31.151
new raspberry Danish
should be served?

05:31.152 --> 05:33.286
Piping-hot or cooled
by refreshing butter?

05:33.287 --> 05:36.523
Mind keeping it down, Mr. President?
We're all moving a little slow.

05:36.524 --> 05:41.327
- Mnuchin's party got wild last night.
- Uh, he didn't have a party,

05:41.328 --> 05:44.731
because if he did, I would
have been invited. Right, Nooch?

05:44.732 --> 05:47.734
Threw a total sicky.
It was epic.

05:47.735 --> 05:50.702
Ben Carson drove a car through
my house stone-cold sober.

05:50.703 --> 05:53.672
In my experiences, valets are inside.

05:53.673 --> 05:55.707
Did you misspell my name on the invite?

05:55.708 --> 05:58.077
Here. Let me write it down
very clearly for you.

05:58.078 --> 06:00.413
I threw your invite in the trash.

06:00.414 --> 06:01.880
When you finish the budget bill,

06:01.881 --> 06:05.651
- you can hang out with your friends.
- Don't baby me, Kelly!

06:05.652 --> 06:07.553
I could totally run this
business without you.

06:07.554 --> 06:10.022
This isn't a business.
It's a government.

06:10.023 --> 06:13.716
Wow. And you wonder why you
haven't won Employee of the Month.

06:15.258 --> 06:18.496
<i>Welcome back.
It's Countdown to the Shutdown.</i>

06:18.497 --> 06:20.866
<i>Protesters have descended
on Washington,</i>

06:20.867 --> 06:25.036
<i>as lawmakers appear no closer
to a budget deal, the final...</i>

06:25.037 --> 06:27.372
<i>sticking point is that one side's</i>

06:27.373 --> 06:30.275
<i>entire political philosophy
does not, in any way,</i>

06:30.276 --> 06:31.742
<i>overlap with the others.</i>

06:31.743 --> 06:34.612
<i>We go now live to Paul Ryan.</i>

06:34.613 --> 06:37.215
Do you think a shutdown would
hurt Republicans in the midterms?

06:37.216 --> 06:39.684
And a follow-up ... What
the hell am I talking about?

06:39.685 --> 06:41.870
Republicans love that sort of thing.
Never mind.

06:43.755 --> 06:47.758
And it just made me think, like,
midterms are gonna be here soon.

06:47.759 --> 06:51.729
This might be our last year
in office together.

06:51.730 --> 06:53.297
- So many memories.
- Ah.

06:53.298 --> 06:56.366
Remember when you gave that
speech on the House floor

06:56.367 --> 07:00.104
with toilet paper stuck to your shoe?

07:00.105 --> 07:02.072
And then we authorized the Iraq War?

07:02.073 --> 07:04.408
- Right.
- That war was bananas!

07:04.409 --> 07:07.478
Like, a lot of people got hurt and died.

07:07.479 --> 07:09.213
- Right, right.
- Yeah. Right.

07:09.214 --> 07:11.115
But you know what I remember
most about it?

07:11.116 --> 07:13.483
- Yeah?
- Our parties did it together.

07:13.484 --> 07:14.951
- Oh, you're right.
- So true!

07:14.952 --> 07:16.552
- You're right about that.
- We got to really enjoy

07:16.553 --> 07:19.555
this time and have fun,
like when we were teenagers

07:19.556 --> 07:24.330
reading Ayn Rand and harassing the
kids in the free-lunch line.

07:25.896 --> 07:27.697
<i>Why are all these white people mad?</i>

07:27.698 --> 07:28.898
I'm trying to help them.

07:28.899 --> 07:31.634
And now I got to go to this
dumb shutdown meeting.

07:31.635 --> 07:34.504
Dad, why are you letting this
Kelly dude tell you what to do?

07:34.505 --> 07:37.072
What's the point of having
your own branch of government

07:37.073 --> 07:38.841
if you can't break it off, plant it,

07:38.842 --> 07:40.743
and grow your own Christmas tree?!

07:40.744 --> 07:42.911
I don't know. I guess
Kelly keeps me organized.

07:42.912 --> 07:45.581
He tells annoying people
not to barge into my office,

07:45.582 --> 07:48.183
reminds me not to call every
foreign leader "Doodle Bug."

07:48.184 --> 07:51.020
Sounds like he friggin' sucks!
If he was cool like you,

07:51.021 --> 07:53.588
he'd hold meetings in the
bathroom while he took a dump.

07:53.589 --> 07:55.991
You know what?
You're right! Forget Kelly.

07:55.992 --> 08:00.095
For the first time in my life, I'm
gonna say and do whatever I want.

08:00.096 --> 08:02.797
♪ General Kelly, your reign is done! ♪

08:02.798 --> 08:04.533
- Ohh.
- # I'm gonna do me #

08:04.534 --> 08:08.170
- Dad!
- # Donald J. Tru-u-u-mp #

08:08.171 --> 08:13.312
Dad... what the fuck are you
doing?! That's really good.

08:18.894 --> 08:22.763
When I get back, I want the
United States government funded.

08:22.764 --> 08:24.898
And that means no parties.

08:24.899 --> 08:26.667
Don't worry.
We're not having a party.

08:26.668 --> 08:28.135
We're totally throwing a party.

08:28.136 --> 08:31.472
It's gonna make Mnuchin's party
look like Mike Pence's personality.

08:31.473 --> 08:33.274
Personality is sin.

08:33.275 --> 08:36.610
Don, Eric, get some candies,
treats, and sweet treats.

08:36.611 --> 08:39.480
What's the difference between
treats and sweet treats?

08:39.481 --> 08:41.914
Eric! Don't worry, Dad.
I'll explain it to him later.

08:41.916 --> 08:43.616
And we're gonna have it in
the living room!

08:43.618 --> 08:47.153
- So someone clean it up.
- I'm an excellent cleanser.

08:47.154 --> 08:49.089
This is no longer
General Kelly's White House!

08:49.090 --> 08:51.257
It's Donny Trump's
Funky Baby Party Box,

08:51.258 --> 08:53.826
where cool Trumps rule
and lame generals drool.

08:53.827 --> 08:57.497
Mr. President, you promised General
Kelly you'd work on that bill.

08:57.498 --> 08:58.965
Don't worry.
Susan's on it.

08:58.966 --> 09:02.835
- We all know Susan doesn't exist.
- Really? Susan might disagree.

09:02.836 --> 09:04.471
Maybe check in with her on that.

09:06.273 --> 09:09.141
Can you believe all this shutdown ...

09:09.142 --> 09:13.045
Crap. Sorry. It's my first
bipartisan night out in a while.

09:13.046 --> 09:15.447
Let's forget about
the shutdown for a sec.

09:15.448 --> 09:19.151
How about, to break the ice,
you ask us anything you want?

09:19.152 --> 09:20.520
No judgment.

09:20.521 --> 09:24.123
Okay. Um, do you really
want to raise taxes?

09:24.124 --> 09:26.058
Heck, no.
That money's ours.

09:26.059 --> 09:29.328
Exactly!
Your turn. Ask us anything.

09:29.329 --> 09:32.297
Benghazi.
What's that all about?

09:32.298 --> 09:36.168
To be honest, I don't know what
Benghazi is, where it happened...

09:36.169 --> 09:38.003
Oh, yeah.
Folks in Louisville

09:38.004 --> 09:41.306
are always coming up to me
worried about Libya. Oh, get real.

09:41.307 --> 09:43.975
Wow!
We are having fun!

09:43.976 --> 09:46.745
I'm not even faking this
giant open-mouth smile.

09:46.746 --> 09:50.849
I can't stop it now, and I'm
actually getting a bit frightened.

09:50.850 --> 09:54.485
Hey, this might sound weird ...
do you guys ever tub?

09:54.486 --> 09:55.754
- Ooh!
- Ooh!

09:55.755 --> 09:57.422
- Ooh!
- Right?

09:57.623 --> 10:00.724
Ruffians are planning
White House protests

10:00.725 --> 10:04.362
even larger than when you issued
a travel ban on Episcopalians

10:04.363 --> 10:07.165
because you thought they were
refugees from Episcopalia.

10:07.166 --> 10:09.534
McMasters, why are we
talking about this?

10:09.535 --> 10:12.703
Everyone is stoked on my party,
and no one gives two nickels

10:12.704 --> 10:15.372
about Kelly's weird scheme
to fund the government.

10:15.373 --> 10:16.941
What are you talking about?
I love parties.

10:16.942 --> 10:19.577
It's always nice to let your
hair down, take your medals off.

10:19.578 --> 10:24.048
- But your duty to this country comes first.
- Lighten up, McMaster!

10:24.049 --> 10:26.584
With everyone upset
about the government

10:26.585 --> 10:30.054
not doing anything, a party
would be a welcome distraction.

10:30.055 --> 10:32.855
Mattis, my man!
Sanders, you in?

10:32.856 --> 10:35.892
Hell yeah!
Just a warnin' ... after three beers,

10:35.893 --> 10:39.296
I attack anyone who reminds me
remotely of my father.

10:39.297 --> 10:42.466
Now that we're all cozy,
everyone go around

10:42.467 --> 10:46.369
and say something that you'd
never admit to the American people.

10:46.370 --> 10:49.844
I don't know where I'm supposed
to sit in the Senate.

10:49.879 --> 10:50.930
- Oh, my goodness.
- What?!

10:50.965 --> 10:52.375
- Are you serious?
- I love that!

10:52.376 --> 10:53.743
- I have no idea.
- That's amazing.

10:53.744 --> 10:57.480
I got one. I've never set
foot inside a voting booth.

10:57.481 --> 10:58.982
- What?!
- Wow!

10:58.983 --> 11:00.549
- That's not ...
- That's truly not okay.

11:00.550 --> 11:01.818
- That is insane!
- I mean, what's the point? It's not like

11:01.819 --> 11:05.421
- one person can actually make a difference.
- This is freaking awesome!

11:05.422 --> 11:08.890
I feel like I just mandated
drug tests for food stamps.

11:08.891 --> 11:11.960
- Whoo! Yeah, baby!
- It's too bad we have to get back

11:11.961 --> 11:16.098
- and negotiate this budget bill.
- Well, who says we do?

11:16.099 --> 11:18.934
The only thing I'm negotiating
is who gets out

11:18.935 --> 11:23.271
- to turn the jets on in 15 minutes.
- I'm into that.

11:23.272 --> 11:26.008
I'd also be into
reaching across the aisle

11:26.009 --> 11:29.410
just to, uh... you know...

11:29.411 --> 11:31.079
feel around.

11:31.080 --> 11:36.652
- What?
- Okay, I clearly misread the vibe.

11:38.787 --> 11:40.421
<i>Hey! We're having a party!</i>

11:40.422 --> 11:42.691
<i>Is this great or what!
Hey! Come on!</i>

11:42.692 --> 11:45.326
Let's hear it!
Everyone get their sugar sticks?!

11:45.327 --> 11:47.195
Man, if we had these in Vietnam,

11:47.196 --> 11:50.632
it would have taken way longer
to lose that war! Hah-ha!

11:50.633 --> 11:53.768
Ah, tah-pah-pah-pah-pah.
Take it easy on those, McMaster.

11:53.769 --> 11:55.536
Nooch, what are we watching?

11:55.537 --> 11:57.872
I've got pornos based on
every movie I've produced ...

11:57.873 --> 12:00.841
"Collateral Booty,"
"Mad Max: Furry Chode,"

12:00.842 --> 12:04.378
- "The Lego Batman Porno."
- I have to recuse myself.

12:04.379 --> 12:06.047
Let's just watch the news.

12:06.048 --> 12:09.216
My body reacts the same way to
news as it does to pornography.

12:09.217 --> 12:11.885
<i>There's a chance we might
not get paid for weeks!</i>

12:11.886 --> 12:13.987
<i>Who knows what
I'll tell my kids?!</i>

12:13.988 --> 12:17.224
Get over it, you crybaby!

12:17.225 --> 12:18.692
Crap! It's Kelly!

12:18.693 --> 12:21.695
Everybody flush yourself
down the toilet, now!

12:21.696 --> 12:24.298
What the hell is going on here?!

12:24.299 --> 12:28.668
Hey, General 
Kelly! Yay!

12:29.099 --> 12:31.667
<i>Okay, so, I didn't pass a budget.</i>

12:31.668 --> 12:33.937
Big deal.
You didn't pass one, either.

12:33.938 --> 12:36.940
Sir, the government's only
funded for one more day.

12:36.941 --> 12:38.541
This is serious!

12:38.542 --> 12:41.610
If it's so serious, then
why am I wearing this hat?

12:41.611 --> 12:45.448
You call Congressional leaders
and negotiate a damn bill.

12:45.449 --> 12:47.550
- Now!
- You can't tell me what to do!

12:47.551 --> 12:51.119
- You're not my real dad!
- I'm not even your fake dad.

12:51.120 --> 12:52.722
But if you want to
respect your office

12:52.723 --> 12:55.658
and act like a grown adult,
then pass a bill.

12:55.659 --> 12:58.461
But if you want to be a
little toddler, eat sugar,

12:58.462 --> 13:01.663
and drink sugar,
don't expect my help.

13:01.664 --> 13:02.865
So, what'll it be?

13:09.639 --> 13:12.974
- Cupcakes!
- Guess who cut a culinary

13:12.975 --> 13:16.544
magnet school's funding
and got their desserts!

13:16.665 --> 13:18.666
<i>♪ Three white people on a couch ♪</i>

13:18.667 --> 13:20.969
<i>♪ It's "Fox & Friends" ♪</i>

13:20.970 --> 13:22.537
I'm glad President Trump

13:22.538 --> 13:25.439
isn't taking this government
shutdown seriously.

13:25.440 --> 13:26.941
I don't need some FDA bureaucrat

13:26.942 --> 13:29.143
getting between me
and my poisoned meats!

13:29.144 --> 13:31.345
Sure, museums will close,
but, hey, that'll keep

13:31.346 --> 13:33.180
those suits of armor
and woolly mammoths

13:33.181 --> 13:35.349
from running loose when they
get struck by lightning

13:35.350 --> 13:39.022
- and come to life.
- That was so...

13:41.023 --> 13:44.225
- Is he dead?
- ...fun. What's on the docket today?

13:44.226 --> 13:46.394
How about a prank?
Somebody get the flu

13:46.395 --> 13:50.330
and then kiss Chief Justice
John Roberts.

13:50.331 --> 13:54.101
Oh, we'd love to say yes,
but our constituents are giving us

13:54.102 --> 13:58.005
- hell about this budget deal.
- So, we took a look at your proposals.

13:58.006 --> 14:01.174
One provision makes
gun owners tax-exempt.

14:01.175 --> 14:03.209
Who cares about all that stuff?

14:03.210 --> 14:05.746
All I care about is
that four-seater hot tub

14:05.747 --> 14:08.902
and my three besties!

14:09.050 --> 14:10.583
Oh, for pig shit's sake.

14:11.284 --> 14:13.153
<i> "Infowars."</i>

14:13.154 --> 14:16.423
<i>We have video proof

<i>ostensibly from different parties</i>

14:18.259 --> 14:20.260

14:20.261 --> 14:24.460

<i>Chuck Schumer! There is

14:36.242 --> 14:39.911
Mother of God!
They think we're bipartisan.

14:40.873 --> 14:43.041
<i>Finally, no Kelly to bother me.</i>

14:43.042 --> 14:46.911
Hey, I'm gonna watch some TV
if anyone wants to join!

14:46.912 --> 14:50.616
No dweebs, goobers, weenies,
or mean people!

14:52.418 --> 14:55.387
Heard your Draconian gatekeeper,
General Kelly, is out,

14:55.388 --> 14:57.922
which means I'm in!
Your personal space!

14:57.923 --> 15:01.025
- There's something I'd like to parlay.
- I'm not blurbing your novel.

15:01.026 --> 15:02.894
A whodunit about a brilliant
White House aide

15:02.895 --> 15:04.595
getting stood up
repeatedly at the movies.

15:04.596 --> 15:08.399
Is it sheer coincidence or evidence
of a much more insidious plot?

15:08.400 --> 15:10.268
"The Feminine Menace: Volume I."

15:10.269 --> 15:11.736
- Dad.
- Dad. Look at this rock.

15:11.737 --> 15:13.437
- No! Look at my rock!
- Dad. Yo. Look at my rock.

15:13.438 --> 15:14.905
- Don? Don?
- Dad?

15:14.906 --> 15:17.141
- No, don't look at his rock!
- Look at my rock!

15:17.142 --> 15:18.809
- Ben, you're not my son.
- Dad. Dad. Daddy. Dad.

15:18.810 --> 15:20.077
- Is this Mike Pence's office?
- Don.

15:20.078 --> 15:21.779
- It's my office.
- Dad!

15:21.780 --> 15:24.248
-. Michael forgot his lunch in here.
- Dad!

15:24.249 --> 15:26.651
You're insane if you think
I didn't already eat that!

15:26.652 --> 15:28.118
Ted Cruz!
What are we watching?

15:28.119 --> 15:29.386
- Don?
- Dad! Dad!

15:29.387 --> 15:31.255
Holy smokes! I feel like
I'm in the Wild West!

15:31.256 --> 15:33.223
- Yee-haw!
- Dad!

15:34.759 --> 15:38.000
- Dad!
- Dad!

15:40.498 --> 15:43.295
A donkey kicking someone through
a couple of swinging doors!

15:43.330 --> 15:44.429
Lord, have mercy!

15:44.764 --> 15:47.404
<i> So, then, what are you saying?</i>

15:47.405 --> 15:50.239
We're saying we lost
sight of ourselves.

15:50.240 --> 15:53.410
Those jets blinded us to the truth.

15:53.411 --> 15:56.913
That tub was a beautiful
apolitical womb!

15:56.914 --> 16:01.017
The deep connections I felt last night
I've never felt for anyone!

16:01.018 --> 16:04.453
Not my wife, my kids,
my red hat and barbells!

16:04.454 --> 16:07.256
Knock it off!
You're gonna get us killed.

16:07.257 --> 16:10.793
Come on! Chuck, I rubbed
in your scalp tonic.

16:10.794 --> 16:13.262
Nancy, I told you
my middle-school secret

16:13.263 --> 16:16.165
about sneaking into
ceramics after hours

16:16.166 --> 16:19.301
to make myself a clay boob
I kept under my bed!

16:19.302 --> 16:24.139
And as much as that story meant to
me, this is the way it has to be.

16:24.140 --> 16:26.842
Paul, I know this applies
to whenever you're awake,

16:26.843 --> 16:29.378
but you're embarrassing yourself.

16:29.379 --> 16:31.513
<i>Hey, hey, ho, how!</i>

16:31.514 --> 16:33.958
<i>The government should not shut down!</i>

16:33.993 --> 16:35.383
<i>Hey, hey, ho, hur!</i>

16:35.384 --> 16:38.488
<i>The government shutdown
should not occur!</i>

16:40.857 --> 16:43.024
This place is a mad house!

16:43.025 --> 16:45.026
I'm heading out to play
a few holes of golf!

16:45.027 --> 16:47.162
What's 18 times 5?
A thousand?

16:47.163 --> 16:51.132
Wouldn't show your face right now, sir.
Massive protests have begun.

16:51.133 --> 16:54.301
Those have nothing to do with me.
I'm just a simple golfing man.

16:54.302 --> 16:56.838
But if it makes them go away,
I'll do the bill.

16:56.839 --> 16:59.674
There is no bill. The House can't
agree on a single budget item.

16:59.675 --> 17:02.810
Right now they're stuck in negotiations
over how many vertical lines

17:02.811 --> 17:04.479
go through the "S" in a dollar sign.

17:04.480 --> 17:06.646
Then round up all those stiffs
and fix it.

17:06.647 --> 17:10.084
I've never rounded up anyone that
wasn't presumed dead weeks later.

17:10.085 --> 17:12.051
You're gonna need Kelly
for this one.

17:12.653 --> 17:16.891
<i> Many people are to blame
for this government shutdown,</i>

17:16.892 --> 17:19.359
but no group deserves
more blame than...

17:19.361 --> 17:23.396
Don't do it, Nancy.
Remember! The tub!

17:23.397 --> 17:27.259
...than the Republicans!

17:27.294 --> 17:30.103
Everyone knows the blame
lies squarely with

17:30.104 --> 17:33.774
the House Democrats,
whose leader, just last night,

17:33.775 --> 17:35.675
told me that she thinks women

17:35.676 --> 17:39.112
should make 90 cents
to the dollar, tops!

17:39.113 --> 17:41.281
Yeah? So? Yeah?

17:41.282 --> 17:45.218
In middle school,
Paul Ryan made a clay boob!

17:45.219 --> 17:47.086
Yeah, yeah, yeah? So?!

17:47.087 --> 17:49.422
I was gonna...
tell everyone, anyway!

17:49.423 --> 17:52.525
Ya-hoo!
Go on! Get 'em, Nancy!

17:52.526 --> 17:54.460
Go get McConnell!
Get him now!

17:54.461 --> 17:56.229
Go on! Git!

17:56.230 --> 18:00.706
<i>He's got a banjo!</i>

18:00.741 --> 18:04.770
<i>♪ Three white people
rocking out in Washington ♪</i>

18:04.921 --> 18:09.959
And welcome back to Fox News'
Rockin' Washington Shutdown!

18:09.960 --> 18:13.696
With performances by Travis
Tritt's brother, Lonnie Tritt,

18:13.797 --> 18:16.731
and the Eliminate the
Estate Tax Junior Dancers.

18:16.732 --> 18:19.668
And I'm being told that
Fox News' fireworks guy

18:19.669 --> 18:23.672
is unavailable because he is,
indeed, uh, Lonnie Tritt.

18:23.673 --> 18:26.508
So instead, we'll use our mouths
to make firework sounds.

18:26.509 --> 18:29.244
<i>Three, two, one!</i>

18:30.713 --> 18:32.513
- Blue, yellow, green!
- Boom, bang! Wow!

18:33.424 --> 18:35.717
All you had to do was call
Congressional leaders,

18:35.718 --> 18:39.187
and we'd be fine, but you
just had to have your fun.

18:39.188 --> 18:41.555
Well, maybe if you ever
did something for me!

18:41.556 --> 18:43.591
Everything I do is for you.

18:43.592 --> 18:46.761
Who had your back when you
accidentally called a war widow

18:46.762 --> 18:49.230
thinking it was Grubhub
and yelled at her

18:49.231 --> 18:51.031
for not bringing enough
blue-cheese dressing?

18:51.032 --> 18:55.202
You suffocated me!
"No TV, Mr. President! No golf!

18:55.203 --> 18:57.838
Miss Universe contestants
aren't foreign dignitaries!"

18:57.839 --> 19:00.274
You won't let me do anything!
I hate you!

19:00.275 --> 19:02.836
- You don't mean that.
- Yes, I do!

19:02.871 --> 19:05.045
I hate you!
I hate you! I hate you!

19:09.617 --> 19:14.560
<i>Oh, God. Come on, Donald.
You got two more in you.</i>

19:14.956 --> 19:18.358
<i>All right. One more,
and your point is made.</i>

19:20.194 --> 19:22.017
I hate you.

19:26.900 --> 19:30.436
<i>Protesters, evil generals,</i>

19:32.973 --> 19:35.074
I hate the White House!

19:35.075 --> 19:37.042
- Where to, sir?
- The only place where I can

19:37.043 --> 19:40.312
tell someone to do something
and they do it, no matter what.

19:40.513 --> 19:43.215
<i>Hey, yeah,
could I get the number 2...?</i>

19:43.216 --> 19:45.450
<i>Ohh!</i>

19:45.451 --> 19:47.953
Do you guys have lasagna?!

19:47.954 --> 19:49.789
<i>- No.
- I see it on the menu!</i>

19:49.790 --> 19:52.424
<i>Uh, we saw you
tape that up there, sir.</i>

19:52.425 --> 19:54.393
Why don't you
just do what I say?!

19:54.394 --> 19:57.162
Is that General Kelly in there?
Ugh! Okay, fine.

19:57.163 --> 19:59.898
You put me down for nine
gravy packets while I decide.

19:59.899 --> 20:02.233
Ohh! Ooh!
What the...?

20:02.234 --> 20:05.136
The protestors.
How did they find me?

20:05.137 --> 20:08.340
- Seatbelts. Aah!
- McMasters, if I don't make it,

Vermont Patrick Leahy.

20:29.127 --> 20:31.762
I was sure we'd be bros to the end.

20:31.763 --> 20:35.533
- What happened with you two?
- What always happens, Paul.

20:35.534 --> 20:37.868
Talk radio found out
about our friendship.

20:37.869 --> 20:42.440
- Washington happened.
- What you had was real, Mitch.

20:42.441 --> 20:46.009
And what we had with Nancy
and Chuck, that was real, too.

20:46.010 --> 20:47.211
- Ohh!
- Grow up, kid!

20:47.212 --> 20:49.313
This isn't a sleep-away camp.

20:49.314 --> 20:52.349
Huh... You and your open
palm are right, Mitch.

General Kelly!
How did you find us?

22:05.454 --> 22:08.255
You're the President in
an upside-down Air Force One

22:08.256 --> 22:10.057
in a fast-food drive-through.

22:10.058 --> 22:13.360
It's the most photographed
event in human history.

22:13.361 --> 22:16.230
Wow. Even in an upside-down
plane, I'm still prisoner

22:16.231 --> 22:18.265
to the media's judging gaze.

22:18.376 --> 22:21.012
We said some...
things back there,

22:21.013 --> 22:23.914
but people are pretty upset
about this government shutdown.

22:23.915 --> 22:26.083
I know ... you're
the big man in charge.

22:26.084 --> 22:29.253
You've got the longest tie in the room.

22:29.254 --> 22:30.854
And you don't need to do
anything you don't want to do.

22:30.855 --> 22:33.490
But I really think you
should get back to work.

22:33.491 --> 22:35.992
Can I watch a few hours of TV first?

22:35.993 --> 22:38.362
Government shutdown, sir.
They turned off your cable.

22:38.363 --> 22:40.764
<i>President Trump racing
back to Washing-ton</i>

22:40.765 --> 22:42.699
<i>to hammer out a budget deal.</i>

22:42.700 --> 22:44.834
<i>We're told the only hiccup
is his head</i>

22:44.835 --> 22:47.370
<i>contains four gallons of blood

22:47.371 --> 22:50.506
<i>and his feet are so drained,
they're basically flippers.</i>

22:50.507 --> 22:52.776
All right, I'm back.
Skip the boring stuff.

22:52.777 --> 22:54.678
Where do I sign to
get TV working again?

22:54.679 --> 22:57.280
We're in a fight, and the
Republicans started it

22:57.281 --> 23:00.883
- with their ridiculous proposals!
- No! Chuck started it.

23:00.884 --> 23:04.087
Boys! Obviously, it's whoever
started it's fault,

23:04.088 --> 23:05.521
but let's be adults here.

23:05.522 --> 23:08.424
Be adults?
That's rich coming from you.

23:08.425 --> 23:10.759
You take that back, or
we're not friends anymore!

23:10.760 --> 23:12.127
- Screw you!
- Take a hike, will you?

23:12.128 --> 23:14.463
- I hate you!
- You're all Dumpster people!

23:14.464 --> 23:16.799
Knock it off!
You're all babies.

23:16.800 --> 23:18.968
Has anyone here gone to war?

23:18.969 --> 23:22.771
No, but I did play in a college
intramural Frisbee golf game

23:22.772 --> 23:26.308
that got pretty darn
physical, so I get it.

23:26.309 --> 23:27.443
If you had gone to war,

23:27.444 --> 23:31.079
you'd know that it doesn't matter
if you like your fellow soldiers.

23:31.080 --> 23:34.116
You'd have to grow the hell up
and work together

23:34.117 --> 23:36.751
because you're responsible for
something more important

23:36.752 --> 23:38.320
than yourselves ...

23:38.321 --> 23:40.822
turning the tide in Vietnam.

23:40.823 --> 23:43.725
- He's right.
- He makes a good point, doesn't he?

23:43.726 --> 23:46.293
- For Vietnam!
- And don't forget me!

23:46.294 --> 23:48.496
I'm also responsible for
something more important

23:48.497 --> 23:50.765
than me ...
the perception of me.

23:50.766 --> 23:53.267
So, what do you say
we make me look good?

23:53.268 --> 23:56.771
We are so proud to announce
that Congress has passed

23:56.772 --> 24:02.443
historic legislation to fund
the government for 15 more hours.

24:05.654 --> 24:08.756
You know, Mr. President,
I kind of missed you.

24:08.757 --> 24:12.159
I realized I need someone to
order around, just as much

24:12.160 --> 24:14.895
as you need someone to resent
for ordering you around.

24:14.896 --> 24:16.664

24:16.665 --> 24:18.265

24:22.736 --> 24:25.839
<i>Yes. Tremendous!
Great.</i>

24:25.840 --> 24:30.243
Mr. President?
Oh, fuck.

more than I hate myself.
