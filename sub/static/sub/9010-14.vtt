WEBVTT

00:08.250 --> 00:10.334
CHECK OUT ALL THIS

00:08.250 --> 00:10.334
COOL STUFF FROM

00:08.250 --> 00:10.334
LOST AND FOUND.

00:10.375 --> 00:12.542
SOME OF THIS STUFF

00:10.375 --> 00:12.542
HAS BEEN IN HERE FOR DECADES,

00:12.584 --> 00:14.834
INCLUDING

00:12.584 --> 00:14.834
THAT SANDWICH.

00:17.292 --> 00:20.000
IT'S LIKE DIGGING THROUGH

00:17.292 --> 00:20.000
THE HISTORY OF MIGHTY MED.

00:20.042 --> 00:23.042
BORING. I DON'T CARE

00:20.042 --> 00:23.042
ABOUT THE PAST.

00:23.083 --> 00:25.459
WHICH EXPLAINS WHY

00:23.083 --> 00:25.459
YOU FAILED OUR HISTORY TEST.

00:25.500 --> 00:28.042
I FAILED BECAUSE

00:25.500 --> 00:28.042
I FOLLOWED A KID

00:25.500 --> 00:28.042
WHO LOOKED LIKE YOU

00:28.083 --> 00:29.542
INTO THE WRONG

00:28.083 --> 00:29.542
CLASSROOM.

00:29.584 --> 00:33.542
BUT I DID LEARN

00:29.584 --> 00:33.542
THE WORD FOR UMBRELLA

00:29.584 --> 00:33.542
IN FRENCH.

00:33.584 --> 00:38.000
- WHAT IS IT?

00:33.584 --> 00:38.000
- I DON'T KNOW.

00:33.584 --> 00:38.000
IT WAS YESTERDAY.

00:38.042 --> 00:41.000
I TOLD YOU, I DON'T

00:38.042 --> 00:41.000
CARE ABOUT THE PAST.

00:43.083 --> 00:44.542
OH, LOOK.

00:44.584 --> 00:46.584
OPTIMO'S DAGGER OF TRUTH.

00:46.626 --> 00:48.959
THE SHAWL OF

00:46.626 --> 00:48.959
INVISIBILITY.

00:49.000 --> 00:52.250
THIS THING.

00:54.083 --> 00:55.042
MY GOODNESS!

00:55.083 --> 00:57.500
A WORMHOLE

00:55.083 --> 00:57.500
TRANSPORTER.

00:57.542 --> 00:59.375
I HAVEN'T SEEN

00:57.542 --> 00:59.375
ONE OF THESE IN YEARS.

00:59.417 --> 01:01.042
A WORMHOLE TRANSPORTER?

01:01.083 --> 01:03.250
IN THE 1950's,

01:01.083 --> 01:03.250
SUPERHEROES USED THESE

01:03.292 --> 01:06.083
TO REVERSE TIME

01:03.292 --> 01:06.083
BY OPENING WORMHOLES IN SPACE

01:06.125 --> 01:08.334
BUT THEY WERE BANNED

01:06.125 --> 01:08.334
BECAUSE, EVERY SO OFTEN,

01:08.375 --> 01:10.417
A HERO WOULD

01:08.375 --> 01:10.417
GET LOST IN TIME,

01:10.459 --> 01:12.334
OR EXPLODE INTO

01:10.459 --> 01:12.334
A MILLION TINY PIECES.

01:13.542 --> 01:15.626
I USUALLY LOVE CONFETTI,

01:15.667 --> 01:19.918
BUT THAT...

01:15.667 --> 01:19.918
NOT SO FESTIVE.

01:19.959 --> 01:22.500
TOLD YOU

01:19.959 --> 01:22.500
OLD THINGS ARE LAME.

01:22.542 --> 01:24.459
HOW COULD YOU THINK

01:22.542 --> 01:24.459
THAT THING IS LAME?

01:24.500 --> 01:27.167
I WAS TALKING

01:24.500 --> 01:27.167
ABOUT HORACE.

01:28.584 --> 01:30.667
YEAH, THAT DEVICE

01:28.584 --> 01:30.667
LOOKS LAME, TOO.

01:30.709 --> 01:32.584
BET IT CAN'T EVEN

01:30.709 --> 01:32.584
TAKE PICTURES.

01:35.584 --> 01:39.250
JEEPERS, WHERE AM I?

01:39.292 --> 01:42.959
WHO IS THAT,

01:39.292 --> 01:42.959
AND WHERE DID HE COME FROM?

01:43.000 --> 01:44.959
THAT'S CAPTAIN ATOMIC.

01:45.042 --> 01:47.667
I'D SAY HE CAME

01:45.042 --> 01:47.667
FROM 1953.

01:47.709 --> 01:50.042
1953?

01:50.083 --> 01:52.500
THAT WAS, LIKE,

01:50.083 --> 01:52.500
100 YEARS AGO.

01:52.542 --> 01:56.000
WHICH EXPLAINS WHY

01:52.542 --> 01:56.000

02:48.751 --> 02:50.459
OF CAPTAIN ATOMIC?

02:50.500 --> 02:53.375
MY GRANDPA HAS

02:50.500 --> 02:53.375
ALL OF HIS COMIC BOOKS.

02:53.417 --> 02:56.709
HE ALSO HAS

02:53.417 --> 02:56.709
HUGE EARLOBES.

02:56.751 --> 03:00.042
WHAT? WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

02:56.751 --> 03:00.042
MY GRANDPA.

03:00.083 --> 03:02.667
CAPTAIN ATOMIC WAS

03:00.083 --> 03:02.667
WOUNDED IN WORLD WAR II

03:02.709 --> 03:04.292
BY A RADIOACTIVE BULLET

03:04.334 --> 03:06.042
WHICH SHOULD HAVE

03:04.334 --> 03:06.042
PENETRATED HIS HEART,

03:06.083 --> 03:08.083
BUT IT WAS STOPPED BY

03:06.083 --> 03:08.083
THE LUCKY YO-YO

03:08.125 --> 03:11.042
GIVEN TO HIM

03:08.125 --> 03:11.042
BY HIS BEST GAL.

03:11.083 --> 03:13.626
THE BULLET TURNED

03:11.083 --> 03:13.626
HIM RADIOACTIVE,

03:13.667 --> 03:16.209
AND THE ARMY FITTED HIM

03:13.667 --> 03:16.209
WITH AN EXPERIMENTAL BATTERY

03:13.667 --> 03:16.209
THAT KEEPS HIM ALIVE

03:16.250 --> 03:17.792
HE AND HIS YO-YO

03:16.250 --> 03:17.792
ARE ATOMICALLY POWERED.

03:17.834 --> 03:20.000
SO ARE MY FARTS.

03:21.334 --> 03:24.500
NO, THEY ARE.

03:21.334 --> 03:24.500
ASK MY BROTHERS.

03:24.542 --> 03:25.792
WHERE AM I?

03:25.834 --> 03:27.792
FIVE MINUTES AGO,

03:25.834 --> 03:27.792
I ENTERED A WORMHOLE

03:27.834 --> 03:30.459
TO STOP PROFESSOR SLIME

03:27.834 --> 03:30.459
FROM SLIMING THE PLANET MALMARN.

03:30.500 --> 03:32.542
UNFORTUNATELY,

03:30.500 --> 03:32.542
YOU BECAME TRAPPED

03:32.584 --> 03:34.459
IN THAT WORMHOLE

03:32.584 --> 03:34.459
FOR DECADES.

03:34.500 --> 03:38.125
OH, AND BY THE WAY,

03:34.500 --> 03:38.125
MALMARN IS NOW CALLED

03:34.500 --> 03:38.125
SLIMEMARN.

03:38.167 --> 03:41.292
SO THIS IS THE FUTURE?

03:41.334 --> 03:43.375
WAIT.

03:43.417 --> 03:45.000
HORACE DIAZ,

03:43.417 --> 03:45.000
IS THAT YOU?

03:46.209 --> 03:48.292
YOU KNEW HIM

03:46.209 --> 03:48.292
IN THE '50s?

03:48.334 --> 03:49.709
HORACE, HOW OLD ARE YOU?

03:49.751 --> 03:52.125
A GENTLEMAN

03:49.751 --> 03:52.125
NEVER ASKS.

03:52.167 --> 03:54.500
A LADY NEVER TELLS.

03:54.542 --> 03:56.751
AND I'M 3,006...

03:54.542 --> 03:56.751
IN MAY.

03:58.083 --> 04:01.292
THE PLACE

03:58.083 --> 04:01.292
LOOKS SO DIFFERENT.

04:01.334 --> 04:04.417
AND WHO ARE ALL THESE

04:01.334 --> 04:04.417
BROADS DRESSED AS DOCTORS?

04:04.459 --> 04:06.334
THOSE ARE DOCTORS.

04:06.375 --> 04:08.542
( hearty laughter )

04:08.584 --> 04:11.375
GIRL DOCTORS?

04:08.584 --> 04:11.375
THAT'S THE CRAZIEST

04:08.584 --> 04:11.375
THING I EVER HEARD.

04:11.417 --> 04:13.083
RIGHT, LIZARD DOCTOR?

04:13.125 --> 04:15.667
( grunts )

04:17.584 --> 04:20.459
BOYS, WE NEED TO OPEN

04:17.584 --> 04:20.459
ANOTHER WORMHOLE

04:20.500 --> 04:22.584
TO GET CAPTAIN ATOMIC

04:20.500 --> 04:22.584
BACK TO HIS OWN TIME.

04:25.083 --> 04:27.042
HUH. THIS WORMHOLE

04:25.083 --> 04:27.042
TRANSPORTER NEEDS

04:25.083 --> 04:27.042
TO BE REPAIRED.

04:27.083 --> 04:28.751
I'LL GO WORK ON IT.

04:28.792 --> 04:32.542
DON'T TELL HIM HOW MUCH

04:28.792 --> 04:32.542
GASOLINE COSTS NOW.

04:32.584 --> 04:34.250
IT'LL KILL HIM.

04:36.209 --> 04:39.417
OOH, WE GET TO HANG OUT

04:36.209 --> 04:39.417
WITH CAPTAIN ATOMIC.

04:39.459 --> 04:43.751
YOU MEAN,

04:39.459 --> 04:43.751
LAME-O McCHEESY TIGHTS?

04:45.626 --> 04:47.334
ARE YOU

04:45.626 --> 04:47.334
KIDDING ME, KAZ?

04:47.375 --> 04:49.918
CAPTAIN ATOMIC WAS

04:47.375 --> 04:49.918
THE TECTON OF HIS TIME.

04:49.959 --> 04:52.500
LOOK AT HIS COMIC BOOK.

04:54.667 --> 04:56.125
"KA-PLOOF"?

04:56.167 --> 04:58.834
WHAT EVEN MAKES

04:56.167 --> 04:58.834
THAT SOUND?

05:00.334 --> 05:03.459
IT'S SOLAR FLARE.

05:00.334 --> 05:03.459
WHAT HAPPENED?

05:03.500 --> 05:04.876
THE BLACK FALCON AGAIN.

05:04.918 --> 05:06.500
THIS IS

05:04.918 --> 05:06.500
THE FOURTH SUPERHERO

05:06.542 --> 05:08.250
HE'S INJURED

05:06.542 --> 05:08.250
THIS WEEK.

05:08.292 --> 05:12.042
WELL, THAT NO-GOODNIK

05:08.292 --> 05:12.042
IS CRUISIN' FOR A BRUISIN'.

05:12.083 --> 05:14.042
BUT HAVE NO FEAR.

05:14.083 --> 05:16.209
FOR WHEN EVIL REARS

05:14.083 --> 05:16.209
ITS UGLY HEAD,

05:16.250 --> 05:17.876
JUSTICE WILL ALWAYS

05:16.250 --> 05:17.876
PREVAIL.

05:17.918 --> 05:21.250
NOW, IT'S TIME FOR ME

05:17.918 --> 05:21.250
TO MAKE LIKE AN ATOM...

05:21.292 --> 05:23.834
AND SPLIT.

05:23.876 --> 05:27.918
DUDE, SERIOUSLY?

05:23.876 --> 05:27.918
LOOK...

05:27.959 --> 05:31.500
VILLAINS ARE A LOT MORE

05:27.959 --> 05:31.500
POWERFUL NOW THAN IN THE '50s.

05:31.542 --> 05:33.334
DON'T LISTEN TO HIM,

05:31.542 --> 05:33.334
CAPTAIN ATOMIC.

05:33.375 --> 05:34.626
YOU CAN STILL MOP THE FLOOR

05:33.375 --> 05:34.626
WITH ANY VILLAIN OUT THERE.

05:34.667 --> 05:36.834
JUSTICE HAS NO

05:34.667 --> 05:36.834
EXPIRATION DATE.

05:36.876 --> 05:38.459
HAVE NO FEAR,

05:36.876 --> 05:38.459
YOUNG LAD.

05:38.500 --> 05:40.709
NO ONE CAN DEFEAT ME,

05:40.751 --> 05:42.042
NOT WITH MY TRUSTY WEAPON

05:42.083 --> 05:44.667
MY ATOMIC YO-YO

05:42.083 --> 05:44.667
OF VICTORY.

05:44.709 --> 05:47.667
TO THE SKIES.

05:53.459 --> 05:55.626
THERE USED TO BE

05:53.459 --> 05:55.626
A SKYLIGHT THERE.

06:01.626 --> 06:04.584
SO, HOW ARE THE TWO

06:01.626 --> 06:04.584
LOVELIEST LADIES IN SCHOOL

06:04.626 --> 06:07.042
WHO DON'T PRETEND THEY'RE

06:04.626 --> 06:07.042
MANNEQUINS WHEN I TRY

06:04.626 --> 06:07.042
TO TALK TO THEM?

06:10.459 --> 06:11.792
STAND STILL.

06:11.834 --> 06:14.834
ITS VISION IS

06:11.834 --> 06:14.834
BASED ON MOVEMENT.

06:16.542 --> 06:18.667
I'M ABOUT TO

06:16.542 --> 06:18.667
MAKE YOUR DAY.

06:18.709 --> 06:21.542
I'VE DECIDED TO SHOOT

06:18.709 --> 06:21.542
A MOVIE, AND I WANT

06:18.709 --> 06:21.542
YOU BOTH TO BE IN IT.

06:21.584 --> 06:23.542
COOL! WHAT'S IT ABOUT?

06:23.584 --> 06:26.083
I WAS HOPING YOU MIGHT

06:23.584 --> 06:26.083
HAVE SOME IDEAS.

06:26.125 --> 06:30.000
I'M NOT VERY CREATIVE,

06:26.125 --> 06:30.000
WHICH IS WHY I'M GOING

06:26.125 --> 06:30.000
INTO THE MOVIE BUSINESS.

06:30.042 --> 06:32.751
OOH, WE SHOULD DO

06:30.042 --> 06:32.751
A MOVIE ABOUT MY FACE.

06:32.792 --> 06:35.626
I WOULD, LIKE,

06:32.792 --> 06:35.626
TOTALLY GO SEE THAT.

06:35.667 --> 06:38.959
WAIT! I HAVE

06:35.667 --> 06:38.959
A NOT-INSANE IDEA.

06:39.000 --> 06:43.083
WE SHOULD MAKE A MOVIE

06:39.000 --> 06:43.083
THAT FEATURES A STRONG

06:39.000 --> 06:43.083
FEMALE LEAD CHARACTER.

06:43.125 --> 06:44.792
SOMEONE LIKE,

06:43.125 --> 06:44.792
I DON'T KNOW,

06:44.834 --> 06:47.125
- SKYLAR STORM.

06:44.834 --> 06:47.125
- WHAT?

06:47.167 --> 06:49.375
NO ONE LIKES

06:47.167 --> 06:49.375
SKYLAR STORM ANYMORE,

06:49.417 --> 06:52.584
SINCE HER LAST

06:49.417 --> 06:52.584
COMIC BOOK WHERE SHE

06:49.417 --> 06:52.584
LOST ALL OF HER POWERS,

06:52.626 --> 06:55.626
TO THE ANNIHILATOR.

06:52.626 --> 06:55.626
HE ISN'T EVEN

06:52.626 --> 06:55.626
THAT TOUGH.

06:58.125 --> 07:02.626
OH, YEAH?

06:58.125 --> 07:02.626
I'D LIKE TO SEE

06:58.125 --> 07:02.626
YOU BATTLE HIM, PUNK.

07:02.667 --> 07:05.000
NOW THERE'S NEVER BEEN

07:02.667 --> 07:05.000
A SKYLAR STORM MOVIE,

07:05.042 --> 07:08.042
AND THIS WILL PROVE

07:05.042 --> 07:08.042
THAT SHE'S STILL COOL

07:05.042 --> 07:08.042
AND STILL IMPORTANT.

07:08.083 --> 07:10.709
- MY LITTLE BROTHER

07:08.083 --> 07:10.709
LIKES HER COMICS.

07:08.083 --> 07:10.709
- SEE?

07:10.751 --> 07:12.751
MY LITTLE BROTHER

07:10.751 --> 07:12.751
ALSO LIKES TO

07:12.792 --> 07:15.792
DRESS UP OUR CAT

07:12.792 --> 07:15.792
AS "KITTY PERRY."

07:17.375 --> 07:19.459
FINE. WE'LL MAKE

07:17.375 --> 07:19.459
A SKYLAR STORM MOVIE.

07:19.500 --> 07:22.500
AND TELL YOUR BROTHER

07:19.500 --> 07:22.500
HE'S DOING THE COSTUMES.

07:27.292 --> 07:30.417
CAPTAIN ATOMIC'S

07:27.292 --> 07:30.417
BEEN GONE FOR,

07:27.292 --> 07:30.417
LIKE, TWO HOURS.

07:30.459 --> 07:32.584
I HATE TO SAY

07:30.459 --> 07:32.584
I TOLD YOU SO,

07:32.626 --> 07:34.709
BUT MAYBE WE SHOULD

07:32.626 --> 07:34.709
SEND SOMEONE TO

07:32.626 --> 07:34.709
GO HELP HIM.

07:34.751 --> 07:37.250
UH, CAPTAIN ATOMIC

07:34.751 --> 07:37.250
DOES NOT NEED ANY HELP.

07:37.292 --> 07:39.292
IN FACT, I BET,

07:37.292 --> 07:39.292
ANY MINUTE NOW,

07:39.334 --> 07:41.751
HE'LL STROLL IN HERE,

07:39.334 --> 07:41.751
HAVING DEFEATED

07:39.334 --> 07:41.751
THE BLACK FALCON,

07:41.792 --> 07:43.042
AND HEROICALLY SAY--

07:43.083 --> 07:44.876
TO THE TRAUMA WARD!

07:45.834 --> 07:48.667
WHAT?!

07:45.834 --> 07:48.667
THIS IS HORRIBLE.

07:48.709 --> 07:51.042
WHY DID I ENCOURAGE

07:48.709 --> 07:51.042
CAPTAIN ATOMIC

07:51.083 --> 07:52.417
TO GO OUT AND FIGHT?

07:52.459 --> 07:53.918
HE WAS OBVIOUSLY

07:52.459 --> 07:53.918
OUTMATCHED.

07:53.959 --> 07:55.709
MAN, DON'T TAKE IT

07:53.959 --> 07:55.709
SO HARD.

07:55.751 --> 07:57.667
MAYBE HE WAS CONFUSED

07:55.751 --> 07:57.667
BY SEEING EVERYTHING

07:55.751 --> 07:57.667
IN COLOR

07:57.709 --> 08:00.083
FOR THE FIRST TIME.

08:00.125 --> 08:03.042
KAZ, THE PAST WAS NOT

08:00.125 --> 08:03.042
IN BLACK AND WHITE.

08:03.083 --> 08:05.834
YOU DON'T KNOW THAT.

08:09.792 --> 08:11.792
( toneless whistling )

08:18.751 --> 08:20.542
THANK YOU, PHILLIP.

08:20.584 --> 08:23.042
I THINK YOU NAILED THE PART

08:20.584 --> 08:23.042
OF INNOCENT BYSTANDER

08:23.083 --> 08:26.542
HIT WITH GRAPES

08:23.083 --> 08:26.542
FOR NO APPARENT REASON.

08:26.584 --> 08:27.792
NEXT!

08:31.459 --> 08:34.667
BEFORE I AUDITION FOR

08:31.459 --> 08:34.667
THE ROLE OF SKYLAR STORM,

08:34.708 --> 08:37.000
I WANTED YOU TO KNOW

08:34.708 --> 08:37.000
THAT I FOUND THIS COSTUME,

08:37.042 --> 08:40.708
AND COINCIDENTALLY,

08:37.042 --> 08:40.708
IT FITS ME PERFECTLY.

08:40.751 --> 08:43.876
THIS LOOKS

08:40.751 --> 08:43.876
PRETTY FAKE.

08:45.083 --> 08:48.500
BUT GO AHEAD, CONNIE.

08:45.083 --> 08:48.500
WOW ME.

08:50.834 --> 08:53.417
THERE'S A STORM COMING.

08:50.834 --> 08:53.417
SKYLAR STORM.

09:01.834 --> 09:06.042
OKAY, PEOPLE, I'VE SEEN

09:01.834 --> 09:06.042
ALL I NEED TO SEE.

09:06.083 --> 09:08.000
THE ROLE OF

09:06.083 --> 09:08.000
SKYLAR STORM

09:08.042 --> 09:11.250
GOES TO... STEPHANIE!

09:14.834 --> 09:17.417
WHAT?! HOW CAN YOU

09:14.834 --> 09:17.417
NOT PICK ME?

09:17.459 --> 09:19.417
I WAS BORN TO PLAY

09:17.459 --> 09:19.417
THIS ROLE...

09:19.459 --> 09:21.667
LITERALLY, IN A POT

09:19.459 --> 09:21.667
OF NUTRIENT SOLUTION.

09:24.792 --> 09:28.250
I MEAN, THE MATERNITY

09:24.792 --> 09:28.250
WARD OF A REGULAR HOSPITAL.

09:30.083 --> 09:31.584
SORRY, CONNIE.

09:31.626 --> 09:32.709
YOU'RE JUST

09:31.626 --> 09:32.709
NOT THE RIGHT TYPE.

09:32.751 --> 09:34.042
AND STEPHANIE IS?

09:34.083 --> 09:36.792
YOU BET.

09:34.083 --> 09:36.792
SHE JUST HAS

09:34.083 --> 09:36.792
THAT CERTAIN

09:36.834 --> 09:39.417
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">JE NE SAIS QUOI.</font></i>

09:39.459 --> 09:40.959
WHAT DOES THAT EVEN MEAN?

09:41.000 --> 09:43.292
I DON'T KNOW.

09:43.334 --> 09:45.334
BUT SHE HAS IT!

09:47.042 --> 09:48.792
STEPHANIE, SHOW CONNIE

09:48.834 --> 09:51.375
A BIT OF THAT ACTING

09:48.834 --> 09:51.375
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">JE NE SAIS QUOI.</font></i>

09:53.083 --> 09:56.834
UH, THERE'S, LIKE,

A STORM COMING.

09:56.876 --> 09:59.334

09:59.375 --> 10:03.042
SEE? I DON'T KNOW

09:59.375 --> 10:03.042
WHAT THAT WAS.

10:03.083 --> 10:05.500
BUT DON'T WORRY, CONNIE.

10:05.542 --> 10:07.459
YOU STILL HAVE

10:05.542 --> 10:07.459
A PART IN THE MOVIE.

10:07.500 --> 10:09.667
I'M CASTING YOU AS

10:07.500 --> 10:09.667
INNOCENT BYSTANDER

10:07.500 --> 10:09.667
HIT WITH GRAPES

10:09.709 --> 10:11.626
FOR NO APPARENT REASON.

10:17.000 --> 10:18.751
IF YOU THINK THAT'S GOING

10:17.000 --> 10:18.751
TO GET YOU THE PART

10:18.792 --> 10:20.042
OF ANGRY MAN WHO KICKS

10:18.792 --> 10:20.042
OVER A CHAIR,

10:20.083 --> 10:22.709
YOU'RE SADLY MISTAKEN.

10:29.042 --> 10:30.751
KAZ, I THINK

10:29.042 --> 10:30.751
I KNOW WHAT'S WRONG.

10:30.792 --> 10:32.375
HELP ME TURN HIM OVER.

10:35.667 --> 10:38.542
- SEE?

10:35.667 --> 10:38.542
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">- PARAPLUIE.</font></i>

10:38.584 --> 10:41.959
- WHAT?

10:38.584 --> 10:41.959
- THAT'S THE FRENCH

10:38.584 --> 10:41.959
WORD FOR UMBRELLA.

10:43.083 --> 10:44.834
BOYS, WHAT'S

10:43.083 --> 10:44.834
THE PROBLEM?

10:44.876 --> 10:46.709
CAPTAIN ATOMIC'S

10:44.876 --> 10:46.709
ATOMIC BATTERY IS CORRODED.

10:46.751 --> 10:49.417
I SHOULD HAVE EXAMINED

10:46.751 --> 10:49.417
HIM BEFORE I ENCOURAGED

10:46.751 --> 10:49.417
HIM TO FIGHT.

10:49.459 --> 10:51.459
WE'VE GOTTA REPLACE

10:49.459 --> 10:51.459
HIS BATTERY OR HE'LL DIE.

10:51.500 --> 10:53.083
DO YOU HAVE

10:51.500 --> 10:53.083
ANY REPLACEMENTS?

10:53.125 --> 10:54.834
WE HAVE PLENTY

10:53.125 --> 10:54.834
OF THOSE.

10:54.876 --> 10:56.876
- OH, WHERE?

10:54.876 --> 10:56.876
- IN 1953.

10:56.918 --> 11:00.751
THAT WAS THE LAST YEAR

10:56.918 --> 11:00.751
WE MANUFACTURED

10:56.918 --> 11:00.751
ATOMIC BATTERIES.

11:00.792 --> 11:02.083
IT TURNED OUT

11:00.792 --> 11:02.083
THE MAIN COMPONENT,

11:02.125 --> 11:05.918
URADIUM 7, HAD SOME

11:02.125 --> 11:05.918
UNPLEASANT SIDE EFFECTS.

11:05.959 --> 11:07.042
WHAT KIND OF

11:05.959 --> 11:07.042
SIDE EFFECTS?

11:07.083 --> 11:08.792
LET'S JUST SAY

11:07.083 --> 11:08.792
DR. GLOWHEAD

11:08.834 --> 11:10.417
WASN'T BORN THAT WAY.

11:10.459 --> 11:12.709
HEY, I WAS JUST

11:10.459 --> 11:12.709
TALKIN' ABOUT YOU.

11:19.918 --> 11:21.792
THIS IS ALL MY FAULT.

11:23.125 --> 11:25.751
HORACE, CAN YOU USE

11:23.125 --> 11:25.751
THE WORMHOLE TRANSPORTER

11:25.792 --> 11:27.584
TO SEND US BACK TO

11:27.626 --> 11:28.834
SO WE CAN GET

11:27.626 --> 11:28.834
AN ATOMIC BATTERY?

11:28.876 --> 11:30.042
NO. ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

11:30.083 --> 11:31.959
I DON'T WANNA GET STUCK

11:30.083 --> 11:31.959
IN A WORMHOLE.

11:32.000 --> 11:33.792
SORRY, I CAN'T SEND YOU;

11:32.000 --> 11:33.792
IT'S NOT REPAIRED YET.

11:33.834 --> 11:35.626
GOOD.

11:35.667 --> 11:38.042
- NOW IT'S REPAIRED.

11:35.667 --> 11:38.042
- DANG IT.

11:38.083 --> 11:41.167
- BUT I STILL CAN'T SEND YOU,

11:38.083 --> 11:41.167
IT'S TOO DANGEROUS.

11:38.083 --> 11:41.167
- GOOD.

11:41.209 --> 11:44.042
BUT IT'S THE ONLY WAY

11:41.209 --> 11:44.042
TO SAVE CAPTAIN ATOMIC'S LIFE.

11:44.083 --> 11:46.042
DANG IT.

11:46.083 --> 11:47.792
I DON'T CARE

11:46.083 --> 11:47.792
HOW DANGEROUS IT IS.

11:47.834 --> 11:49.626
- I'M GOING.

11:47.834 --> 11:49.626
- GOOD.

11:49.667 --> 11:51.918
- AND YOU'RE

11:49.667 --> 11:51.918
COMING WITH ME.

11:49.667 --> 11:51.918
- DANG IT.

Advertise your product or brand here

12:01.751 --> 12:03.042
KAZ, WE DID IT.

12:03.083 --> 12:04.834
WE'RE IN THE 1950's.

12:04.876 --> 12:07.626
THERE'S THE ORIGINAL

12:04.876 --> 12:07.626
SOLAR FLARE

12:07.667 --> 12:08.959
BEFORE SHE

12:07.667 --> 12:08.959
PASSED ON THE TORCH.

12:10.250 --> 12:12.751
AND THERE'S

12:10.250 --> 12:12.751
THE SCARLET CYCLONE.

12:21.834 --> 12:23.667
OKAY, ALL RIGHT.

12:23.709 --> 12:25.792
WE NEED TO FIND

12:23.709 --> 12:25.792
THE ATOMIC BATTERIES.

12:25.834 --> 12:27.042
I'LL MAP OUT A PLAN.

12:27.083 --> 12:28.667
THIS PILL BOTTLE

12:27.083 --> 12:28.667

12:28.709 --> 12:30.709
THIS TONGUE DEPRESSOR

12:28.709 --> 12:30.709
WILL BE ME.

12:30.751 --> 12:32.667
THIS ATOMIC BATTERY

12:30.751 --> 12:32.667
WILL BE THE DOOR.

12:35.083 --> 12:38.042
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

12:35.083 --> 12:38.042
NOW WE DON'T KNOW

12:35.083 --> 12:38.042
WHERE THE DOOR IS.

12:38.083 --> 12:39.918
THIS IS THE BATTERY.

12:39.959 --> 12:42.042
LET'S GO.

12:39.959 --> 12:42.042
WE'VE GOTTA GET BACK.

12:42.083 --> 12:45.667
IF CAPTAIN ATOMIC DIES,

12:42.083 --> 12:45.667
I'LL NEVER FORGIVE MYSELF.

12:48.083 --> 12:49.834
STAND DOWN, INTRUDERS.

12:51.083 --> 12:52.751
NO, WAIT, I CAN

12:51.083 --> 12:52.751
ACTUALLY EXPLAIN.

12:59.083 --> 13:01.042
I GOTTA ADMIT,

13:01.083 --> 13:03.626
I KINDA WANT

OKAY, I DON'T

13:20.209 --> 13:22.751
ACTUALLY KNOW IT,

13:22.792 --> 13:26.709
BUT IF MY FRIEND SAID IT,

13:22.792 --> 13:26.709
I COULD MOUTH ALONG.

13:56.083 --> 13:58.792
THE JUKEBOX.

14:01.751 --> 14:03.042
DON'T PICK B-17.

14:03.083 --> 14:06.000
IT REMINDS ME OF... HER.

14:09.792 --> 14:13.042
I CAUGHT THESE TWO

14:09.792 --> 14:13.042
STEALING AN ATOMIC BATTERY.

14:13.083 --> 14:17.209
I ASSUME THE BROWN-HAIRED

14:13.083 --> 14:17.209
BEATNIK WITH BANGS IN HIS EYES

14:13.083 --> 14:17.209
IS THE MASTERMIND.

14:17.250 --> 14:19.042
THERE'S NO WAY

14:17.250 --> 14:19.042
THIS YOUNG MAN

14:19.083 --> 14:21.042
- WITH HIS PERFECT HAIR...

14:19.083 --> 14:21.042
- THANKS.

14:21.083 --> 14:23.792
- AND SIMPLE BRAIN...

14:21.083 --> 14:23.792
- HEY!

14:23.834 --> 14:25.918
COULD HAVE PLOTTED

14:23.834 --> 14:25.918
TO BREAK IN HERE.

14:25.959 --> 14:27.709
EXCUSE ME A SECOND.

14:30.959 --> 14:32.250
IT'S THE VILLAIN,

14:30.959 --> 14:32.250
RED SCARE.

14:34.209 --> 14:36.334
WELL DONE. NOW,

14:34.209 --> 14:36.334
READ HIM HIS RIGHTS,

14:36.375 --> 14:38.042
GIVE HIM A FAIR TRIAL...

14:38.083 --> 14:41.000
I'M JUST JOKING.

14:38.083 --> 14:41.000
PULL HIS ARMS OFF.

14:43.042 --> 14:45.042
NOW EXPLAIN YOURSELVES,

14:43.042 --> 14:45.042
INTRUDERS.

14:45.083 --> 14:47.375
OR YOU'LL MEET

14:45.083 --> 14:47.375
THE SAME FATE.

14:47.417 --> 14:49.042
HORACE, LOOK, WE WORK

14:47.417 --> 14:49.042
FOR YOU IN THE FUTURE.

14:49.083 --> 14:50.375
WE'RE THE ONLY

14:49.083 --> 14:50.375
NORMOS ON STAFF.

14:50.417 --> 14:52.042
I WOULD NEVER

14:50.417 --> 14:52.042
HIRE NORMOS.

14:52.083 --> 14:54.918
THERE'S NOTHING I HATE

14:52.083 --> 14:54.918
MORE THAN INTRUDERS.

14:54.959 --> 14:58.709
I HATE TO HATE THINGS,

14:54.959 --> 14:58.709
BUT I LOVE TO LOVE THINGS.

14:58.751 --> 15:00.959
THAT'S RIGHT,

14:58.751 --> 15:00.959
YOU LOVE BRIDGES.

15:01.000 --> 15:02.876
BRIDGES?

15:02.918 --> 15:04.918
STURDY, FUNCTIONAL,

15:02.918 --> 15:04.918
STYLISH.

15:04.959 --> 15:06.959
NOT A BAD IDEA.

15:07.000 --> 15:10.751
I LOVE BRIDGES.

15:07.000 --> 15:10.751
I LIKE THE SOUND OF THAT.

15:10.792 --> 15:12.834
BUT YOU TWO WILL STILL

15:10.792 --> 15:12.834
NEED TO BE DE-ARMED.

15:12.876 --> 15:15.042
NO, NO, I LOVE MY ARMS.

15:15.083 --> 15:17.834
IF I DIDN'T HAVE THEM,

15:15.083 --> 15:17.834
HOW COULD I DO THIS?

15:17.876 --> 15:19.167
GUARDS.

15:26.167 --> 15:28.876
NOW, LET'S REHEARSE.

15:28.918 --> 15:30.751
THIS IS SCENE 2-A.

15:30.792 --> 15:34.792
SKYLAR IS ATTACKED BY

15:30.792 --> 15:34.792
A BAND OF ALIEN ASSASSINS.

15:34.834 --> 15:37.209
AND... ACTION!

15:40.167 --> 15:44.042
OH, NO. IT'S, LIKE,

15:40.167 --> 15:44.042
FOUR AGAINST ONE.

15:44.083 --> 15:47.918
WHAT AM I GONNA,

15:44.083 --> 15:47.918
LIKE, DO?

15:47.959 --> 15:49.500
STOP IT!

15:49.542 --> 15:52.334
YOU'RE DESTROYING

15:49.542 --> 15:52.334
SKYLAR STORM'S LEGACY.

15:52.375 --> 15:54.334
SHE WOULD NEVER

15:52.375 --> 15:54.334
FIGHT IN HIGH HEELS.

15:54.375 --> 15:56.167
SHE'S NOT FIGHTING.

15:56.209 --> 15:59.000
SHE'S WAITING TO BE

15:56.209 --> 15:59.000
RESCUED BY MY CHARACTER,

15:59.042 --> 16:01.959
THE GUS LANTERN.

16:02.000 --> 16:03.459
CAN I SEE THIS

16:02.000 --> 16:03.459
FOR A SECOND?

16:03.500 --> 16:05.000
SURE.

16:09.167 --> 16:11.042
IF YOU'RE AUDITIONING

16:09.167 --> 16:11.042
FOR THE PART OF

16:11.083 --> 16:14.834
GIRL WHO THROWS TRIPOD,

16:11.083 --> 16:14.834
YOU GOT IT.

16:14.876 --> 16:17.000
WE'RE SHOOTING

16:14.876 --> 16:17.000
THAT SCENE NEXT.

16:18.417 --> 16:20.167
AND IF I DIDN'T

16:18.417 --> 16:20.167
HAVE MY ARMS,

16:20.209 --> 16:23.918
I COULDN'T DO THIS.

16:20.209 --> 16:23.918
OR THIS.

16:25.375 --> 16:27.000
OR THIS.

16:31.459 --> 16:34.834
BOYS, YOU'RE BACK.

16:31.459 --> 16:34.834
DID YOU GET THE BATTERY?

16:34.876 --> 16:36.876
NOW LET'S PUT IT IN

16:34.876 --> 16:36.876
CAPTAIN ATOMIC

16:36.918 --> 16:38.042
BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE.

16:44.542 --> 16:46.542
I HAD THIS TERRIBLE DREAM

16:44.542 --> 16:46.542
WHERE WOMEN WERE DOCTORS,

16:46.584 --> 16:49.000
AND MEN DIDN'T WEAR HATS.

16:50.584 --> 16:53.000
OH, IT WAS REAL.

16:54.626 --> 16:57.042
WHAT'S GOING ON?

16:57.083 --> 16:59.375
BLACK FALCON HAS TAKEN OUT

16:57.083 --> 16:59.375
ALL OF THE OTHER SUPERHEROES

16:59.417 --> 17:01.042
IN THE CITY.

17:01.083 --> 17:03.626
CAPTAIN ATOMIC'S

17:01.083 --> 17:03.626
THE ONLY ONE LEFT.

17:03.667 --> 17:05.250
YOU GOTTA GO

17:03.667 --> 17:05.250
DO SOMETHING.

17:05.291 --> 17:08.041
LIKE WHAT?

17:05.291 --> 17:08.041
YOU WERE RIGHT

17:05.291 --> 17:08.041
ABOUT ME.

17:08.083 --> 17:10.041
I CAN'T FIGHT

17:08.083 --> 17:10.041
THESE MODERN VILLAINS.

17:10.083 --> 17:11.083
NO, I WAS WRONG.

17:11.125 --> 17:12.876
I JUST SAW YOU

17:11.125 --> 17:12.876
IN THE PAST,

17:12.917 --> 17:14.250
AND YOU KICKED BUTT.

17:14.291 --> 17:16.041
AND YOU'RE AWESOME

17:14.291 --> 17:16.041
WITH THAT YO-YO.

17:16.083 --> 17:18.041
I CAN'T EVEN GET ONE

17:16.083 --> 17:18.041
TO COME BACK UP.

17:18.083 --> 17:20.334
CAPTAIN ATOMIC,

17:18.083 --> 17:20.334
YOU CAN DO IT.

17:20.375 --> 17:21.959
BLACK FALCON

17:20.375 --> 17:21.959
ONLY DEFEATED YOU

17:22.000 --> 17:23.250
BECAUSE YOUR BATTERY

17:22.000 --> 17:23.250
WAS CORRODED.

17:23.291 --> 17:25.041
BUT NOW YOU'RE AT

17:23.291 --> 17:25.041
FULL STRENGTH.

17:25.083 --> 17:27.041
ONCE A HERO,

17:25.083 --> 17:27.041
ALWAYS A HERO,

17:27.083 --> 17:29.918
NO MATTER HOW LAME-O

17:27.083 --> 17:29.918
YOUR McCHEESY TIGHTS ARE.

17:31.334 --> 17:34.042
MAYBE I DO STILL

17:31.334 --> 17:34.042
HAVE WHAT IT TAKES.

17:34.083 --> 17:37.959
SO... TO THE SKIES.

17:38.000 --> 17:40.125
BUT FIRST, WHERE'S

17:38.000 --> 17:40.125
THE LITTLE HEROES' ROOM?

17:40.167 --> 17:43.000
TECHNICALLY, I HAVEN'T GONE

17:40.167 --> 17:43.000
IN, LIKE, 60 YEARS.

17:44.500 --> 17:46.584
THANKS. TO THE RESTROOM.

17:49.542 --> 17:51.334
AND... CUT.

17:54.667 --> 17:58.334
I'M ESPECIALLY GOOD AT

17:54.667 --> 17:58.334
DIRECTING SNACK TIME.

18:00.459 --> 18:03.751
STEPHANIE, I HAVE

18:00.459 --> 18:03.751
A FEW TIPS ON

18:00.459 --> 18:03.751
PORTRAYING SKYLAR STORM

18:03.792 --> 18:05.542
AS THE AMAZING

18:03.792 --> 18:05.542
HERO SHE IS.

18:05.584 --> 18:09.167
FOR ONE THING,

18:05.584 --> 18:09.167
SHE DOESN'T USE

18:05.584 --> 18:09.167
THE WORD "LIKE" SO MUCH.

18:09.209 --> 18:13.125
I DON'T, LIKE,

18:09.209 --> 18:13.125
SAY LIKE, LIKE, A LOT.

18:13.167 --> 18:15.542
DO YOU EVEN,

18:13.167 --> 18:15.542
LIKE, HEAR YOURSELF?

18:15.584 --> 18:18.459
GREAT, NOW I'M,

18:15.584 --> 18:18.459
LIKE, DOING IT.

18:21.500 --> 18:25.167
NEXT ON MY HIT LIST,

18:21.500 --> 18:25.167
SKYLAR STORM.

18:25.209 --> 18:29.959
EWW! SOMEONE COULD,

18:25.209 --> 18:29.959
LIKE, USE A MANICURE.

18:31.542 --> 18:33.459
FIRST YOU LOSE

18:31.542 --> 18:33.459
YOUR POWERS,

18:33.500 --> 18:36.292
AND NOW,

18:33.500 --> 18:36.292
YOU LOSE YOUR LIFE.

18:41.667 --> 18:44.709
HEY, BLACK FALCON,

18:41.667 --> 18:44.709
WHY DON'T YOU PICK ON

18:41.667 --> 18:44.709
THE REAL SKYLAR STORM,

18:44.751 --> 18:47.000
NOT SOME CHEAP KNOCKOFF.

19:05.125 --> 19:06.834
HEY, BIRDBRAIN.

19:06.876 --> 19:08.626
I DON'T MEAN

19:06.876 --> 19:08.626
TO RUFFLE YOUR FEATHERS,

19:08.667 --> 19:11.626
BUT IT'S TIME TO

19:08.667 --> 19:11.626
COCK-A-DOODLE-DO...

19:11.667 --> 19:13.209
YOU IN.

19:13.250 --> 19:15.125
DUDE, SERIOUSLY?

19:58.459 --> 20:01.709
OH, SO THAT'S WHAT

19:58.459 --> 20:01.709
KA-PLOOF SOUNDS LIKE.

20:03.709 --> 20:07.626
THIS ISN'T OVER,

20:03.709 --> 20:07.626
CAPTAIN ATOMIC,

20:03.709 --> 20:07.626
SO WATCH YOUR BACK.

20:12.083 --> 20:14.250
SEE, YOU ARE STILL

20:12.083 --> 20:14.250
AMAZING.

20:14.292 --> 20:15.709
WAIT, AREN'T YOU GONNA

20:14.292 --> 20:15.709
GO AFTER HIM?

20:15.751 --> 20:17.500
( screaming )

20:18.876 --> 20:20.751
NO.

20:20.792 --> 20:24.125
I THINK WE'VE HEARD

20:20.792 --> 20:24.125
THE LAST FROM HIM

20:20.792 --> 20:24.125
FOR A WHILE.

20:29.417 --> 20:32.125
NICE MOVES, KID.

20:32.167 --> 20:33.500
I DON'T KNOW

20:32.167 --> 20:33.500
WHO YOU ARE,

20:33.542 --> 20:35.292
BUT THANKS FOR

20:33.542 --> 20:35.292
SAVING ME.

20:35.334 --> 20:37.709
WELL, I CAN SPOT

20:35.334 --> 20:37.709
A DAMSEL IN DISTRESS

20:37.751 --> 20:39.083
A MILE AWAY.

20:39.125 --> 20:41.626
SERIOUSLY, I CAN SEE

20:39.125 --> 20:41.626
OVER A MILE AWAY.

20:43.292 --> 20:44.626
WELL, GREAT JOB,

20:43.292 --> 20:44.626
BUT SHOULD PROBABLY

20:44.667 --> 20:46.751
GET YOU BACK

20:44.667 --> 20:46.751
TO YOUR OWN TIME.

20:46.792 --> 20:50.083
ACTUALLY, I THINK

20:46.792 --> 20:50.083
I'LL STAY HERE.

20:50.125 --> 20:51.751
THINGS HAVE CHANGED

20:50.125 --> 20:51.751
SO MUCH FOR THE BETTER.

20:51.792 --> 20:53.375
YEAH, LIKE

20:51.792 --> 20:53.375
EQUAL RIGHTS,

20:53.417 --> 20:56.334
AND OPPORTUNITIES

20:53.417 --> 20:56.334
FOR ALL, REGARDLESS

20:53.417 --> 20:56.334
OF RACE OR GENDER.

20:56.375 --> 20:57.709
YEAH, THAT.

20:59.584 --> 21:02.459
BUT I WAS TALKING ABOUT

20:59.584 --> 21:02.459
FLAT SCREEN TV's,

21:02.500 --> 21:05.042
AND SEEDLESS WATERMELON.

21:02.500 --> 21:05.042
THE FUTURE IS AMAZING.

21:07.083 --> 21:08.834
WHAT HAPPENED?

21:08.876 --> 21:11.834
DID I FAINT FROM

21:08.876 --> 21:11.834
TOO MUCH HAIRSPRAY AGAIN?

21:14.125 --> 21:16.709
I DON'T KNOW WHO THE EXTRAS

21:14.125 --> 21:16.709
IN THE COSTUMES WERE,

21:16.751 --> 21:18.751
BUT THEY TOTALLY

21:16.751 --> 21:18.751
RUINED MY MOVIE.

21:18.792 --> 21:20.834
LOOK WHAT YOU DID

21:18.792 --> 21:20.834
TO MY MASTERPIECE.

21:23.209 --> 21:26.459
THE LENS WAS TURNED

21:23.209 --> 21:26.459
THE WRONG WAY?

21:26.500 --> 21:29.042
SO YOU DIDN'T RECORD

21:26.500 --> 21:29.042
ANY OF THIS HORRIBLE MOVIE?

21:29.083 --> 21:30.167
JUST YOUR FACE?

21:30.209 --> 21:32.125
DON'T WORRY.

21:32.167 --> 21:33.918
I'LL JUST CONVERT IT

21:32.167 --> 21:33.918
TO 3D.

21:33.959 --> 21:36.167
PEOPLE WILL SEE

21:33.959 --> 21:36.167
ANY PIECE OF GARBAGE IN 3D.
