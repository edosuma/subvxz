WEBVTT

00:00.376 --> 00:01.876
Previously on Chicago Fire.

00:02.002 --> 00:05.046
Seems that we have an infestation,
known as the common snitch.

00:05.172 --> 00:06.631
Something you want to say to me?

00:06.757 --> 00:07.799
Meet my girl, Isabella.

00:07.925 --> 00:10.093
Sounds like you could use
some campaign help.

00:10.219 --> 00:13.304
- Do you want to celebrate later?
- Yeah, sounds like fun.

00:13.430 --> 00:16.849
He wants you to promise
you won't go away, like Mom and Dad.

00:16.975 --> 00:19.435
I'm right here, guys.
I'm not going anywhere.

00:19.561 --> 00:21.979
You're really into this Jay guy,
aren't you?

00:22.106 --> 00:23.398
Yeah, I think I am.

00:23.524 --> 00:26.609
I want a new deal.
See, my man Jay here,

00:26.735 --> 00:29.821
- he's been assessing your business.
- You came here to spy on us?

00:29.947 --> 00:32.657
- I know who our arsonist is.
- Hadley?

00:32.783 --> 00:35.201
If one of your former men
is now setting fires,

00:35.327 --> 00:38.162
it doesn't exactly cast your leadership
in the most flattering light.

00:42.793 --> 00:44.502
We know you started this fire!

00:46.422 --> 00:48.297
I want to know why Arson Investigation

00:48.424 --> 00:50.717
is wasting their time
checking Hadley's alibis?

00:50.843 --> 00:53.678
He uses timing devices.
He could set a fire downtown

00:53.804 --> 00:55.805
and be in Skokie
before the first bell.

00:55.931 --> 00:58.725
He craves attention.
That's what this is about.

00:58.851 --> 01:00.393
If he thinks nobody's watching,

01:00.519 --> 01:04.397
maybe that will throw him off his game
and he could get sloppy.

01:04.523 --> 01:07.900
So sit around and wait for him
to start another fire? Provoke him?

01:08.026 --> 01:09.902
Whatever, this is...

01:10.028 --> 01:13.197
Wallace really screwed the pooch
on this, huh?

01:13.323 --> 01:14.907
How do you let a guy like
Hadley just...

01:15.033 --> 01:17.326
Wait, Pop, no one saw this coming.

01:17.453 --> 01:19.120
It's only you
and the Fire Marshal's office

01:19.246 --> 01:21.289
that seem to think he had a red flag
pinned to his chest.

01:24.585 --> 01:26.586
Can I borrow you a sec?

01:26.712 --> 01:28.254
Hey, Benny.

01:31.091 --> 01:34.927
Please tell me we're not making
a huge mistake here.

01:35.053 --> 01:37.847
What's up, roomies!

01:37.973 --> 01:39.599
What's up, Otis? Do you need a hand?

01:39.725 --> 01:42.185
My brother's unloading the U-Haul
outside. He's fine.

01:44.188 --> 01:47.106
- What's up, bro?
- Hey.

01:47.232 --> 01:48.941
- Hey, pal.
- Hey.

01:49.067 --> 01:52.653
Oh, man. How awesome is this, huh?

01:52.780 --> 01:58.618
Oh, er... you know, I figured there's
three walls, we each get one. Right?

01:58.744 --> 02:00.870
- Mm-hmm.
- I love it.

02:00.996 --> 02:04.332
I knew you would!

02:05.918 --> 02:07.794
- What's vodka in Russian?
- Vodka.

02:09.588 --> 02:11.005
Hey, you guys got your cut last week.

02:11.131 --> 02:14.050
What, you want to turn me upside down
and shake another dime out of my pocket?

02:14.176 --> 02:15.510
I'm just here to see Gabby.

02:15.636 --> 02:18.471
She don't want to see you, buddy.
Get lost.

02:22.142 --> 02:23.267
You got a problem, pal?

02:23.393 --> 02:25.311
This doesn't involve you, alright?

02:25.437 --> 02:28.648
When a dirt bag like you comes
sniffing around for a friend of mine,

02:28.774 --> 02:29.732
I'm involved.

02:29.858 --> 02:33.986
I don't care who you work for or
how many kneecaps you break every week,

02:34.112 --> 02:35.655
you don't scare me.

02:35.781 --> 02:37.490
Stay the hell away from her.

02:45.999 --> 02:49.418
Careful, Griffin.
No flipping off the bars, OK, buddy?

02:49.545 --> 02:50.378
I won't.

02:50.504 --> 02:52.755
You're a natural.
You're gonna be a great dad.

02:52.881 --> 02:54.423
One day.

02:56.593 --> 02:58.469
You still need me to watch them
after next shift?

02:58.595 --> 03:01.639
Yeah, that'd be great. I got a couple of
repair jobs I've got to get to.

03:01.765 --> 03:03.391
OK.

03:09.690 --> 03:11.107
Everything alright?

03:18.866 --> 03:20.658
I really stepped into it
with this guy Jay.

03:22.327 --> 03:27.081
Complete loser, and I'm trying to end it
and he won't... he won't let it go.

03:28.667 --> 03:31.961
I'd be more than happy
to have a conversation with him.

03:33.964 --> 03:38.134
No, no, it's nothing I can't handle.
Thanks, though.

03:41.221 --> 03:43.931
Last order of business. I'm going to
need a couple of volunteers

03:44.057 --> 03:46.809
to help me with the new Wellness Program
for this house.

03:46.935 --> 03:49.061
It involves workshops, physical exams.

03:49.187 --> 03:52.940
I believe we all have to have
some kind of new fitness diary.

03:54.568 --> 03:56.277
So, volunteers.

03:58.196 --> 04:00.990
I don't have all day.

04:01.992 --> 04:03.326
Good.

04:03.452 --> 04:06.037
Mills, Shay, you are now
the new Wellness Reps.

04:08.749 --> 04:12.752
Ambulance 61,
person in distress, 398 Wells Street.

04:12.878 --> 04:14.337
That's Darryl.

04:14.463 --> 04:17.006
- Our favourite frequent flyer.
- Dismissed.

04:17.132 --> 04:20.509
Hey, Chief, this call, he's a nice guy,
but he just wants company.

04:20.636 --> 04:21.677
It's a nuisance call.

04:21.803 --> 04:26.182
There's nothing we can do about that,
because we can't refuse a call. Go.

04:28.310 --> 04:30.394
Here we go.

04:30.520 --> 04:33.022
Darryl. How you been, buddy?

04:33.148 --> 04:37.276
Oh, I've missed you.
You're looking as beautiful as ever.

04:37.402 --> 04:39.987
- Oh, aren't you the charmer?
- Let's sit up, bud, come on.

04:40.113 --> 04:42.156
There we go.

04:45.494 --> 04:46.911
Let's see your finger.

04:49.581 --> 04:54.210
OK, your blood sugar is 43.
Why is it so low, Darryl?

04:55.253 --> 04:56.921
I know you like it
when we come visit you,

04:57.047 --> 04:59.131
but you have to check your levels, OK?

04:59.257 --> 05:01.342
And eat after you take your insulin.

05:01.468 --> 05:03.511
Alright, I'm going to check
what's in the fridge.

05:03.637 --> 05:06.514
You always take such good care of me.

05:06.640 --> 05:08.224
We talked about this, Darryl.

05:08.350 --> 05:12.269
This is a lot of time and expense
for a glucose shot.

05:12.396 --> 05:14.021
And we have other things to do.

05:14.147 --> 05:15.982
OK.

05:17.109 --> 05:20.111
Bologna and cheese, and no chips.
What's up with that, Darryl?

05:20.237 --> 05:22.113
You know I can't live without my girl.

05:22.239 --> 05:24.031
- Mm-hm. Another bite.
- Well, may I suggest

05:24.157 --> 05:26.075
joining a chat room
and let us do our jobs.

05:26.201 --> 05:28.619
Yeah, she's right, Darryl.
I mean, this has got to stop.

05:30.163 --> 05:35.626
You know, you have no idea
what you mean to me, Leslie.

05:35.752 --> 05:37.962
Oh, well, that's sweet.

05:39.423 --> 05:42.049
Whoa, Darryl? Darryl, er...

05:42.175 --> 05:45.845
Put the gun away right now, Darryl.

05:46.596 --> 05:48.472
You know I can't live without you.

05:50.767 --> 05:55.312
You don't... you don't have to
live without me, Darryl.

05:55.439 --> 05:56.731
I got this, Shay.

05:56.857 --> 06:00.776
I'm not kidding, Darryl.
Put the gun on the floor now!

06:05.991 --> 06:07.825
Darryl...

06:12.873 --> 06:17.752
Look, er... just...
Just give me the gun, OK?

06:17.878 --> 06:19.628
And, er...

06:20.547 --> 06:26.427
And we can go to Vegas tomorrow
and get hitched, OK?

06:26.553 --> 06:28.971
Just give me the gun.

06:30.515 --> 06:33.559
OK, sweetheart?
Just... just give me the gun.

06:36.813 --> 06:37.897
Darryl.

06:56.917 --> 06:58.876
The two of you
should head to the Lakeshore

06:59.002 --> 07:01.087
to get checked out for blood exposure.

07:01.213 --> 07:05.508
I'll notify medical.
Meet you there with the paperwork.

07:06.551 --> 07:10.429
Look, take whatever time you need
to deal with this.

07:10.555 --> 07:13.140
Anything I can do for you,
just let me know.

07:29.241 --> 07:31.033
Hey, you alright?

07:31.159 --> 07:33.077
Fine, thanks.

07:35.580 --> 07:39.041
Yeah, you know, we're OK.

07:42.921 --> 07:44.630
Yo, Mr President.

07:44.756 --> 07:47.675
Not even close.
Lot of ground to make up.

07:47.801 --> 07:49.510
You're going to walk all over Sullivan.

07:49.636 --> 07:52.471
It's going to be like the Harlem
Globetrotters against those white dudes.

07:52.597 --> 07:54.974
- The Washington Generals.
- That's them.

07:55.100 --> 07:57.935
Isabella says I got to campaign
like an underdog.

07:58.061 --> 07:59.770
Politics 101.

08:09.447 --> 08:10.823
Rat.

08:19.666 --> 08:22.835
The, er, ambo sound OK to you?

08:24.045 --> 08:25.212
Yeah, why?

08:25.338 --> 08:28.883
Thought I heard a weird sound
in the engine on our way back.

08:29.009 --> 08:31.010
I didn't hear anything.

08:31.136 --> 08:32.928
It's like a grinding sound.

08:34.181 --> 08:36.599
Anyhow, I'm going to have the Fleet
come take a look at it,

08:36.725 --> 08:39.935
cos the last thing I need is for it
to break down on me on a run.

08:41.188 --> 08:42.980
Give me your shirt.
I'll wash it with mine.

08:43.106 --> 08:44.773
No, I'm good.

09:27.400 --> 09:28.359
Hey.

09:33.990 --> 09:35.366
You OK?

09:35.492 --> 09:37.868
Yeah, I'm fine.

09:53.134 --> 09:56.804
If there's anything
I can do on my end, name it.

09:57.973 --> 10:00.182
Actually, being here in the house helps.

10:02.435 --> 10:04.270
I'll be fine.

10:04.396 --> 10:06.939
Listen, you've got to
take care of yourself.

10:07.065 --> 10:09.358
Forget about watching the boys.
I'll call my sister.

10:09.484 --> 10:10.526
No. No, no, no.

10:10.652 --> 10:14.488
Actually, spending time with them is
kind of exactly what I need right now.

10:16.074 --> 10:17.324
OK.

10:18.326 --> 10:19.576
OK.

10:31.131 --> 10:32.214
What was that about?

10:32.340 --> 10:35.551
I need you to write up a full report
of all interactions between Hadley

10:35.677 --> 10:37.928
and everybody in this house
since we let him go.

10:38.054 --> 10:39.888
That is per McLeod.

10:40.015 --> 10:42.057
What is that got to do
with saving money?

10:42.183 --> 10:46.061
Hey, why doesn't she have her in-house
rat, Clarke, write up the report?

10:46.187 --> 10:47.771
He's been informing on us anyway.

10:47.897 --> 10:49.523
Hey, hey, hey.

10:49.649 --> 10:52.192
We've just got to deal with it. OK?

10:53.987 --> 10:55.195
Thanks.

10:58.908 --> 11:00.034
There she is!

11:01.828 --> 11:04.621
You'd never catch me up there.
I'm terrified of heights.

11:04.748 --> 11:06.874
Great view, though.

11:07.000 --> 11:09.960
Hey, you staying for lunch?
I'm making chicken adobo.

11:10.086 --> 11:12.004
I might take you up on that.

11:12.130 --> 11:15.549
I'm going to be shadowing my candidate
for the next couple of shifts.

11:15.675 --> 11:18.927
We're getting some day-in-the-life
pics of Randy to use in his campaign.

11:19.054 --> 11:21.972
I've been told I possess
an everyman quality.

11:22.098 --> 11:26.226
Oh, yeah. I can see my Uncle Luis
right there around the gut.

11:28.271 --> 11:31.315
So, I set up a meet and greet
at the rec centre down the block.

11:31.441 --> 11:33.317
Friendly crowd, local firefighters.

11:33.443 --> 11:34.985
- It's a great photo op.
- Fantastic.

11:35.111 --> 11:37.696
And we have time to get
some shots around the house first.

11:37.822 --> 11:38.655
Sure.

11:40.241 --> 11:41.158
Ed?

11:43.745 --> 11:45.746
We've got to talk about Gail McLeod.

11:45.872 --> 11:48.248
Chief, believe me,
nobody's happy about making budget cuts.

11:48.375 --> 11:52.044
Look, I understand.
Ms McLeod has a budget to worry about.

11:52.170 --> 11:54.880
But she's crossed a line.
It's getting personal.

11:55.006 --> 11:58.467
She's making all kinds of insinuations
about me, how I run my firehouse,

11:58.593 --> 12:00.552
how I dealt with Hadley,
which is not her job!

12:05.183 --> 12:08.102
Look, if she wants to crunch
her numbers,

12:08.228 --> 12:09.978
let her crunch her damn numbers.

12:10.105 --> 12:12.439
But you have got to get her off my ass.

12:15.610 --> 12:17.444
I'll see what I can do.

12:27.831 --> 12:31.333
You get that email from McLeod
about the new inventory request forms?

12:31.459 --> 12:33.293
Yeah, I got it.

12:37.424 --> 12:39.258
I wish you would have let me
handle Darryl.

12:39.384 --> 12:42.052
Thanks, Dawson. That's exactly
what I needed to hear to make my day.

12:42.178 --> 12:43.554
I'm not blaming you, Shay.

12:43.680 --> 12:45.347
Good. Cos I was doing just fine

12:45.473 --> 12:47.433
without you berating
the man with a gun in his hand.

12:47.559 --> 12:50.185
Well, somebody needed to
defuse the situation.

12:50.311 --> 12:52.563
Maybe he just needed to know
that somebody cared, you know?

12:52.689 --> 12:54.523
Then again, maybe you didn't.
I couldn't tell.

12:54.649 --> 12:57.276
Of course I care. I just don't need to
lead him on to show him.

12:57.402 --> 13:00.279
Come on. We were just having fun
with each other.

13:00.405 --> 13:02.531
And look where it led.

13:03.324 --> 13:05.200
I didn't pull the trigger.

13:06.619 --> 13:10.122
Let me remind you that I'm
the paramedic in charge on Ambulance 61.

13:10.248 --> 13:14.668
If you had stepped back like I asked,
Darryl might still be alive right now.

13:19.883 --> 13:22.384
Shay, I'm sorry, OK?
I didn't mean to...

13:22.510 --> 13:25.012
Sure you did! By all means,
blame me for what happened.

13:25.138 --> 13:26.722
Call in a report
with the Paramedic Chief.

13:26.848 --> 13:30.934
Whatever you need to do to feel better,
but do not talk to me.

13:32.729 --> 13:35.772
We will work together, that's it.

13:43.031 --> 13:45.491
- There he is. Hey, buddy.
- Appreciate it.

13:45.617 --> 13:47.284
- Hey, buddy!
- Good going tiger.

13:47.410 --> 13:48.452
Nice food.

13:49.454 --> 13:51.038
Did you make this little spread happen?

13:51.164 --> 13:52.623
Would it impress you if I did?

13:52.749 --> 13:54.124
Psst.

13:55.335 --> 13:58.629
Who's paying for all the signage
and snacks?

13:58.755 --> 14:00.130
You are.

14:00.256 --> 14:03.425
Then can we just keep it to
chips and salsa next time?

14:03.551 --> 14:07.304
Go. Mingle. Remember,
no talking points, no pressure.

14:07.430 --> 14:09.389
Just have fun.

14:09.516 --> 14:11.642
Good to see ya, Martinez!
I'm counting on your vote.

14:11.768 --> 14:13.185
Hey, Mouch!

14:19.234 --> 14:22.027
If you're such a great union rep,

14:22.153 --> 14:24.029
why did you turn your back
on a union brother?

14:42.382 --> 14:44.132
This guy,

14:44.259 --> 14:47.427
this guy was supposed to represent me,

14:47.554 --> 14:49.429
when I was being forced out of my job.

14:49.556 --> 14:50.722
Why don't you go home?

14:50.848 --> 14:52.808
Because it's my union, too.

14:55.520 --> 14:57.729
I never lied about what happened.

14:57.855 --> 14:59.565
I apologized.

15:00.733 --> 15:03.026
I did everything right.

15:06.823 --> 15:07.864
What did you do?

15:12.620 --> 15:14.955
This guy was afraid to
stand up to the brass.

15:15.081 --> 15:16.707
You call that leadership?

15:17.917 --> 15:19.042
I call it a damn joke.

15:19.168 --> 15:22.546
Your side of the story. Obviously.

15:26.217 --> 15:27.759
You still the one feeding Pouch?

15:30.221 --> 15:31.763
- Get out.
- Where's Severide?

15:31.889 --> 15:33.890
In the change out room,
banging another secretary?

15:34.017 --> 15:35.642
I said get out!

15:38.479 --> 15:40.314
Don't forget to vote.

16:13.556 --> 16:17.100
I heard what happened
with your paramedics this morning. I...

16:17.226 --> 16:19.936
How are they holding up?
Are they alright?

16:20.063 --> 16:21.438
They're working through it.

16:24.776 --> 16:28.236
I understand you spoke to Ed Yates
over at CFD Headquarters.

16:28.363 --> 16:31.782
I did. I'm more than happy
to tell you exactly what I told him.

16:31.908 --> 16:35.702
No, no, thank you.
He's brought me up to speed.

16:35.828 --> 16:42.542
Erm... Ed has been informed
that I'm accountable to the State,

16:42.669 --> 16:45.420
not to the City of Chicago,
and not to the CFD.

16:45.546 --> 16:51.259
So your concerns,
they're not really his department.

16:51.386 --> 16:57.641
Well, thank you for coming all this way
just to inform me of that.

17:00.395 --> 17:01.978
Anything else I can do for you?

17:05.358 --> 17:09.361
What gets you up in the morning
wanting to be a battalion chief?

17:10.363 --> 17:11.905
Why do you still want to do it?

17:12.865 --> 17:14.783
You know, I'm not going to stand here

17:14.909 --> 17:17.244
and be insulted by somebody
who has no idea of the concept

17:17.370 --> 17:19.621
about what it is to be a firefighter.

17:19.747 --> 17:24.501
You want to know how I do my job
and why I do it?

17:24.627 --> 17:26.545
You know what you can do?

17:27.880 --> 17:29.005
Ask around.

17:33.302 --> 17:36.638
He showed up at a union meeting?
Are you kidding me?

17:36.764 --> 17:38.598
You're surprised?

17:38.725 --> 17:41.393
He's unhinged. I'm telling you,
he's going to kill somebody.

17:41.519 --> 17:43.770
I'm just doing my job, Chief.

17:43.896 --> 17:45.647
Who's the broad with Boden?

17:45.773 --> 17:47.441
Mm. McLeod.

17:47.567 --> 17:50.485
She's a consultant that the State sent
to close firehouses.

17:52.905 --> 17:56.032
That's right, Wally. Take on the State.

17:56.159 --> 17:58.034
Maybe you should let me
get back to my job.

17:58.161 --> 17:59.828
Good strategy.

18:04.208 --> 18:05.500
So basically...

18:05.626 --> 18:08.128
everybody has to keep track of
their calorie count,

18:08.254 --> 18:11.381
and report them to me so that I can
put them in my special binder.

18:11.507 --> 18:14.217
Is Mills going to tell us how many
calories he's putting in everything?

18:14.343 --> 18:15.552
Better not.

18:15.678 --> 18:17.971
McLeod can't force us to participate.

18:18.097 --> 18:19.806
We have a contract!

18:19.932 --> 18:22.893
Mouch is right.
You have the right to opt out,

18:23.019 --> 18:25.353
if you prefer to pay
the higher insurance premium.

18:25.480 --> 18:27.439
All right, so the next thing is,

18:27.565 --> 18:29.649
they're trying to encourage us
to be more active.

18:29.776 --> 18:33.528
So they're giving out fitness bonuses to
anybody who can pass the fitness test.

18:33.654 --> 18:35.071
Yeah? Cash bonuses?

18:35.198 --> 18:37.491
No. Gift certificates to...

18:37.617 --> 18:38.950
Oh, my God.

18:39.076 --> 18:40.243
Salad King!

18:40.369 --> 18:43.997
- Ohh!
- Good enough. What's the test?

18:44.123 --> 18:46.208
Push ups for men of your age range...

18:46.334 --> 18:48.210
My age range?

18:49.212 --> 18:51.338
Start counting.

18:51.464 --> 18:53.924
Guys, no.
Look, you've got to file a form.

18:54.050 --> 18:55.842
There you go, buddy!

18:55.968 --> 18:57.844
His salad's gonna be on me, baby!

18:57.970 --> 19:00.138
You gotta schedule it.
You gotta sign...

19:01.682 --> 19:06.019
Truck 81, Squad 3,
Ambulance 61, car accident.

19:14.946 --> 19:17.781
That car was trying to beat somebody
to a spot.

19:17.907 --> 19:19.908
He just ploughed right through the wall!

19:20.034 --> 19:21.701
She's barely breathing.

19:23.496 --> 19:25.163
Everybody get back!

19:25.289 --> 19:26.957
Somebody get us out of here!

19:29.043 --> 19:31.086
Oh, God. What do I do?

19:31.212 --> 19:32.629
She's my best friend.

19:32.755 --> 19:34.840
Stay calm, ma'am.
We'll get you both out.

19:34.966 --> 19:37.843
Casey, get that car out of the drop area
and pull those pin ins out.

19:37.969 --> 19:39.678
Got it. Mills! Get the chain.

19:39.804 --> 19:41.513
Severide, stabilize that car.

19:41.639 --> 19:44.599
There's not enough clearance to get the
rig in. We'll have to take the aerial.

19:44.725 --> 19:47.519
There's no time. Get what you need
from the Squad and load it in the buggy.

19:47.645 --> 19:49.855
- I'll drive you up.
- Alright, come on.

19:51.649 --> 19:54.192
Driver's losing a lot of blood.
At least half a litre.

19:54.318 --> 19:56.319
Be ready. Doesn't look like
she's got a lot of time.

19:56.445 --> 19:59.364
- Hey ma'am? Ma'am, Can you hear me?
- Uh-huh.

19:59.490 --> 20:00.907
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

20:05.913 --> 20:07.539
OK, I want you to take your scarf

20:07.665 --> 20:10.166
and see if you can tie it
around the upper part of her arm

20:10.293 --> 20:11.751
to stop the bleeding, OK?

20:19.385 --> 20:21.553
A little higher up,
right under her shoulder.

20:32.148 --> 20:33.648
Is it safe to get out of the car?

20:33.774 --> 20:35.358
Relax, pal. We're going to get you out.

20:35.484 --> 20:37.444
We don't have time to stabilize the car.

20:37.570 --> 20:40.322
Chief, I'll go on line
and pull the guy out through the back.

20:40.448 --> 20:42.741
- Clarke, you secure the rope.
- Yes, sir.

20:42.867 --> 20:45.243
Tight as you can. Good.

20:48.247 --> 20:50.415
These cables
aren't going to hold much longer.

20:52.126 --> 20:53.752
Throw me the chains! Come on!

20:55.671 --> 20:57.130
- On line!
- Good to go.

20:57.256 --> 20:59.049
One, two, three, go.

20:59.884 --> 21:01.843
- Help me!
- It's OK.

21:01.969 --> 21:03.219
I can feel the car sliding!

21:03.346 --> 21:06.264
You've got to sit still!
Don't move! I'm coming in.

21:10.603 --> 21:12.479
Chains hooked up.

21:14.523 --> 21:17.609
Cover your face!

21:22.490 --> 21:24.157
- You're doing great.
- She's getting pale.

21:24.283 --> 21:26.534
I don't know if it's tight enough.

21:26.661 --> 21:28.536
Please, just get me out of this thing.

21:28.663 --> 21:31.289
- How we doing on that chain?
- Almost there.

21:33.668 --> 21:36.002
Let's get going. Come on!

21:37.755 --> 21:39.631
Easy. I got you.

21:41.550 --> 21:42.717
Cruz, hit it!

21:42.843 --> 21:45.804
Everybody get back! Get back!

21:45.930 --> 21:47.305
One, two, three, go!

21:51.602 --> 21:53.019
Watch out!

22:03.155 --> 22:05.156
Cruz, grab the Hurst!

22:06.951 --> 22:08.952
That's it.

22:09.078 --> 22:11.621
Put it there.
Let's get these doors off.

22:18.212 --> 22:20.505
- Got it!
- Right behind you, Mills.

22:20.631 --> 22:22.716
I need to get a C-collar on her.

22:26.637 --> 22:28.638
- You got her?
- Watch her shoulder.

22:28.764 --> 22:30.140
She's clear!

22:30.266 --> 22:32.183
On three. One, two, three!

22:36.814 --> 22:37.689
Did it work?

22:39.191 --> 22:40.817
I don't even know if she's still alive.

22:40.943 --> 22:43.028
You saved her life.

22:48.159 --> 22:49.534
Dude, dude, dude.

22:49.660 --> 22:52.370
This new apartment is working out great!

22:52.496 --> 22:55.415
Last night, we opened up
this 18-year-old bottle of whiskey

22:55.541 --> 22:58.585
Severide's dad got him.
Freakin' awesome!

22:58.711 --> 23:01.588
- Good for you.
- What's up your ass?

23:01.714 --> 23:04.132
Nothing, Otis.

23:04.258 --> 23:06.259
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Is this about the third bedroom?

23:06.385 --> 23:08.219
Because you said I could have it.

23:08.345 --> 23:11.473
I just think it might get a little
crowded with Severide dating Zoya.

23:11.599 --> 23:13.099
Severide and Zoya? Get out of here.

23:13.225 --> 23:15.310
I saw him pick her up from Molly's.

23:16.896 --> 23:18.354
Well, Zoya doesn't drive.

23:18.481 --> 23:20.398
He was giving her a lift.

23:20.524 --> 23:23.735
Dude, Kelly's my boy. All right?

23:23.861 --> 23:25.820
Boys don't do that to their boys.

23:28.032 --> 23:30.492
- Is that mousse in your hair?
- Hey, hey, hey!

23:30.618 --> 23:32.368
- No, seriously...
- No!

23:32.495 --> 23:33.953
No.

23:43.756 --> 23:46.800
Oh, man.

23:47.635 --> 23:49.135
Mills.

23:49.261 --> 23:51.221
- Oh!
- I saw you left this behind.

23:51.347 --> 23:53.431
- Thanks.
- Scooped it up for you.

23:57.103 --> 23:58.520
Hey, Clarke.

23:59.605 --> 24:02.607
- You shoot pool?
- A little.

24:04.026 --> 24:05.985
How about eight ball?

24:06.112 --> 24:08.363
It's five bucks a game at Silver Cue.

24:08.489 --> 24:10.448
We meet there after shift.

24:10.574 --> 24:13.284
I'll take all your money.

24:16.747 --> 24:18.790
Hey, Griffin? Griffin. Careful.

24:18.916 --> 24:20.041
Careful.

24:20.167 --> 24:22.544
Gabby?
Is Uncle Matt your boyfriend?

24:24.380 --> 24:27.841
No. No, we're just really good friends.

24:27.967 --> 24:28.967
Told ya!

24:34.849 --> 24:36.558
I told you
not to ask her that.

24:36.684 --> 24:38.518
Quit calling me, OK?
We don't have any money.

24:38.644 --> 24:41.396
- It's not about that.
- Then there's nothing to talk about.

24:41.522 --> 24:43.106
Gabby, will you just listen?

24:43.232 --> 24:46.109
I've heard plenty, thanks, OK?
You wasted enough of my time.

24:46.235 --> 24:48.444
You want to keep calling me,
I'm calling the cops.

24:48.571 --> 24:51.614
Gabby!
Griffin fell off the monkey bars!

24:51.740 --> 24:53.074
Oh, God.

24:54.285 --> 24:57.662
- Hey, Griffin? Where does it hurt?
- On my side!

24:57.788 --> 25:01.332
It's OK. Just take nice slow breaths,
alright? You'll be alright.

25:01.458 --> 25:05.628
Yeah, I need an ambulance for
a possible rib fracture at Adams Park.

25:09.842 --> 25:12.719
Hey. He's fine. He's fine.

25:12.845 --> 25:15.555
He's got a cracked rib,
but nothing serious.

25:15.681 --> 25:17.807
- They're doing some routine tests.
- What happened?

25:19.059 --> 25:23.855
Erm... I had to take a call
and I stepped away for a second

25:23.981 --> 25:26.858
and he was in the middle of this flip
that he saw other kids doing at school,

25:26.984 --> 25:29.736
- and I guess he was...
- It's alright.

25:29.862 --> 25:31.237
It's OK.

25:33.073 --> 25:34.574
Where is he?

25:40.122 --> 25:41.623
Ms McLeod?

25:41.749 --> 25:44.042
My name is Benny Severide.

25:44.168 --> 25:46.419
Yes. I know the name.

25:46.545 --> 25:49.297
You have quite the sterling reputation.
It's a privilege.

25:49.423 --> 25:50.798
Thank you.

25:50.925 --> 25:53.384
- Please come in, have a seat.
- Thanks.

25:53.510 --> 25:55.345
I... I'm sorry to drop in like this,

25:55.471 --> 25:58.139
but I felt that it was important
to see you.

25:58.265 --> 26:00.558
Oh, no, it's not a problem at all.
How can I help you?

26:00.684 --> 26:02.393
It's about House 51.

26:02.519 --> 26:06.397
Yes, we are working out
a few problems over there.

26:06.523 --> 26:09.525
- So I understand.
- Your son is at 51.

26:09.652 --> 26:13.363
Yeah. I'm very proud of him,

26:13.489 --> 26:15.365
which is part of the reason I'm here.

26:16.533 --> 26:18.451
I know the guys in that house.

26:18.577 --> 26:21.788
They're good firefighters
in a community that depends on them.

26:24.959 --> 26:31.965
My question to you is, is it a problem
house or is there a problem chief?

26:37.972 --> 26:39.722
- Is that him?
Mm-hm.

27:21.682 --> 27:23.558
Something on your mind?

27:23.684 --> 27:25.768
It's just...

27:26.854 --> 27:29.397
You got to know what they're
saying about you in the house.

27:31.108 --> 27:32.191
I'm not an idiot.

27:32.318 --> 27:35.028
So why don't you say something?
Tell your side of it.

27:37.031 --> 27:38.072
No one asked.

27:40.576 --> 27:42.285
Well, I'm asking.

27:51.211 --> 27:53.338
McLeod asked me to report on House 51.

27:56.842 --> 27:58.926
I said no.

28:00.763 --> 28:02.597
So then who's the rat in our house?

28:02.723 --> 28:05.683
I don't know, man.
I mind my own business.

28:12.691 --> 28:15.151
- They don't even know that...
- OK, stop, stop!

28:15.277 --> 28:19.655
I mean... it's so cheesy!

28:19.782 --> 28:21.783
I mean, Klingons?

28:21.909 --> 28:25.536
Cylons! You haven't even seen the show!

28:25.662 --> 28:27.038
OK? That's it.

28:27.164 --> 28:30.958
We are going to do
an old school Battlestar marathon,

28:31.085 --> 28:33.586
and you are going to thank me.

28:33.712 --> 28:38.257
Oh, my God. Otis...

28:39.843 --> 28:41.386
I'm glad you moved in with us.

28:43.055 --> 28:46.849
Me, too. This is... great.

28:46.975 --> 28:51.270
- It's great! It's really great, right?
- Yeah!

28:51.397 --> 28:55.691
And I need this, you know?
I need to have more fun!

28:55.818 --> 28:59.654
- Yeah, yeah. Oh, yeah.
- Fun in my life, just in general.

28:59.780 --> 29:01.447
- Yeah.
- And I...

29:01.573 --> 29:04.242
This face!

29:04.368 --> 29:07.286
I mean, you're such a cutie pie!

29:27.349 --> 29:29.183
Shay...

29:53.167 --> 29:57.420
Don't tell Kelly about this, OK?

30:16.732 --> 30:17.940
Hey.

30:20.486 --> 30:21.861
33rd and Bell?

30:28.702 --> 30:31.245
That's on the dangerous buildings list.

30:32.748 --> 30:33.748
Let's take a ride.

30:35.751 --> 30:37.335
What's up, Herrmann?

30:37.461 --> 30:41.547
Ah, you know. I got snack duty.

30:41.673 --> 30:43.090
Nice.

30:44.718 --> 30:46.886
Alright, so listen.

30:47.012 --> 30:50.014
Has Gabby talked to you
about Molly's at all?

30:50.140 --> 30:53.017
Nah, just that you guys are getting
soaked by that new bar down the street.

30:53.143 --> 30:54.727
Have you been inside that place?

30:54.853 --> 30:56.062
Of course not. You?

30:56.188 --> 30:57.730
No.

30:58.732 --> 31:00.399
Once. For a birthday party.

31:00.526 --> 31:02.944
It would've been rude
not to show up, you know?

31:03.070 --> 31:07.365
Well, we got another problem
aside from Game Day.

31:07.491 --> 31:08.741
OK.

31:10.786 --> 31:13.663
The old coot who we bought Molly's from,

31:13.789 --> 31:16.832
we kind of inherited
this hanger-on type guy.

31:16.959 --> 31:20.878
We agreed to give him one percent.
But he's been getting more aggressive

31:21.004 --> 31:23.965
and showing up with
some real knuckle draggers.

31:24.091 --> 31:26.259
Now, she'd kill me
for telling you this,

31:26.385 --> 31:30.638
but Dawson got mixed up
with one of those guys.

31:31.890 --> 31:35.726
She cut him loose, but...
he ain't going away easy.

31:38.397 --> 31:40.398
I want a name.

31:45.320 --> 31:47.405
Hey, check it out.

32:02.379 --> 32:04.964
Squad 3 to Main.

32:08.719 --> 32:10.428
- Hey, you want some?
- Thanks.

32:10.554 --> 32:13.598
You enjoying all that
extra space I made in your wallet?

32:18.770 --> 32:20.354
You guys know he was in Iraq, right?

32:20.480 --> 32:22.607
Yeah? As a spy?

32:22.733 --> 32:25.776
No, 1st Battalion, 8th Marines.

32:25.902 --> 32:27.820
He was in one of
the bloodiest battles of the war.

32:27.946 --> 32:30.865
Yeah, well, I wouldn't believe
everything this guy tells you.

32:34.244 --> 32:39.123
Truck 81, Squad 3,
Engine 51, Ambulance 61, structure fire.

32:42.252 --> 32:44.378
Chief, it's Hadley.

32:44.504 --> 32:47.340
Windows are all blocked. The only way
in or out is through the front.

32:47.466 --> 32:48.924
It's a deathtrap.

32:49.051 --> 32:50.801
This building
is known to have squatters.

32:50.927 --> 32:53.888
We've got to get inside to do a search.
No choice.

32:54.014 --> 32:57.683
Everybody proceed with extreme caution.
Floors and stairs might be weak.

32:57.809 --> 32:59.602
Truck, Squad, get in there
and clear a path

32:59.728 --> 33:01.479
for Engine to get their attack lines in.

33:01.605 --> 33:05.024
Got it, Chief. Everybody mask up.
Let's get that door open.

33:13.283 --> 33:16.243
Through this door. Spread out.

33:16.370 --> 33:18.621
Truck go left, Squad go right.

33:19.831 --> 33:22.041
Fire Department! Call out!

33:23.627 --> 33:25.169
Anybody see anything?

33:25.295 --> 33:27.296
No,
but there's that smell again.

33:27.422 --> 33:30.257
This floor is clear.
Let's move up to the fifth.

33:32.344 --> 33:34.261
Everybody watch yourselves.

33:36.473 --> 33:39.975
Fire Department! Call out!

33:41.812 --> 33:44.188
Let's clear a path for Engine.

33:45.774 --> 33:49.276
Check every square inch.
The squatters could be hiding anywhere.

33:49.403 --> 33:52.530
Engine 51, you're clear
to bring in the attack lines.

33:52.656 --> 33:54.323
On our way.

34:00.831 --> 34:02.415
Take cover!

34:05.335 --> 34:07.086
A fire device just went off!

34:08.380 --> 34:09.755
Get down! There's more!

34:12.092 --> 34:13.759
We've got to get off this floor!

34:13.885 --> 34:15.761
Exit's blocked!

34:15.887 --> 34:18.597
Chief!
Fire's accelerating fast!

34:18.724 --> 34:22.017
There's another stairwell
in the 2-3 corner. 40 feet due west.

34:22.144 --> 34:23.644
This way!

34:28.108 --> 34:30.109
The flames are closing in!

34:30.986 --> 34:33.279
Where the hell is it?

34:36.116 --> 34:38.409
It's locked. We've got to force it.
Cruz!

34:43.331 --> 34:44.832
Go!

34:55.635 --> 34:57.928
Hey! In there!

34:58.054 --> 35:01.348
I'm going after Hadley. Everybody else
finish searching the lower levels,

35:01.475 --> 35:02.808
then get the hell out!

35:02.934 --> 35:04.852
Let's start on three
and work our way down.

35:04.978 --> 35:06.645
Hadley!

35:06.772 --> 35:09.774
Hadley's close, Chief.
I'm going to bring him out.

35:12.235 --> 35:14.069
Hadley!

35:34.341 --> 35:35.299
Hey.

35:44.601 --> 35:46.393
All I have to do is drop this bottle.

35:47.729 --> 35:51.357
Flatten the whole block,
and everybody on it.

36:00.617 --> 36:03.828
- Kevin.
- Oh, it's Kevin now?

36:05.664 --> 36:07.081
None of this is worth it, man.

36:10.460 --> 36:12.461
You can still walk out of here alive.

36:14.005 --> 36:15.422
Or we can all go out together.

36:15.549 --> 36:16.966
Hey, hey, hey!

36:30.021 --> 36:31.689
- Severide!
- In here!

36:45.453 --> 36:47.121
Watch it! Watch it!

36:54.462 --> 36:56.130
Get him on the gurney.

36:58.174 --> 36:59.049
Lift!

37:25.201 --> 37:26.952
You still here?

37:28.038 --> 37:29.496
This is the one.

37:54.356 --> 37:57.191
Damn, man. You scared me.

38:00.153 --> 38:01.278
You're the snitch.

38:06.159 --> 38:08.285
What did you just call me?

38:08.411 --> 38:10.120
You heard what I said.

38:10.246 --> 38:12.247
Watch your mouth, Candidate.

38:12.374 --> 38:15.501
You have been feeding information
to McLeod this entire time.

38:18.797 --> 38:20.255
You're the rat.

38:34.813 --> 38:36.855
There's two kinds
of people in the world.

38:36.982 --> 38:39.900
Predators and prey.

38:40.026 --> 38:43.070
You'll drive yourself crazy
trying to understand cases like Hadley.

38:45.031 --> 38:49.827
All you got to do is make sure
that you're never the prey.

38:54.874 --> 38:58.002
Thanks for being here, Pop.
It means a lot.

39:00.171 --> 39:01.714
Don't mention it, kid.

39:27.032 --> 39:28.949
I miss my mom.

39:30.243 --> 39:32.161
I know you do, buddy.

39:33.371 --> 39:34.872
And she misses you guys.

39:35.749 --> 39:37.916
- She'll be out soon.
- A year.

39:38.043 --> 39:41.420
It'll go by fast. I promise.

39:43.173 --> 39:44.339
I'll see you in the morning.

39:44.466 --> 39:47.134
Can you stay with me
until I fall asleep?

39:49.387 --> 39:52.056
- Of course.
- Thanks.

39:55.310 --> 39:58.479
Come here. I'll tuck you in.

40:07.280 --> 40:09.615
I can't believe Herrmann
opened his big mouth.

40:09.741 --> 40:12.284
I'm glad he did. You're mixed up
in some heavy stuff, Gabby.

40:12.410 --> 40:14.787
Don't worry about it, OK?
It's not a big deal.

40:14.913 --> 40:17.081
No, it is.
And you're trying to downplay it

40:17.207 --> 40:19.708
cos you're embarrassed
that you got mixed up with a deadbeat.

40:25.632 --> 40:26.757
Yeah, maybe a little.

40:30.762 --> 40:33.889
Alright, but here's the deal,

40:34.015 --> 40:35.974
and this does not get repeated. Hear me?

40:36.101 --> 40:38.435
OK.

40:39.687 --> 40:41.772
There's something you need to know
about this Jay guy.

40:49.989 --> 40:52.616
- Hey.
- You're a cop?
