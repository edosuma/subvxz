01:46.243 --> 01:48.204
Just a few more questions, Miss Jones.

01:48.287 --> 01:51.165
I'm not sure what else I can tell you.

01:51.248 --> 01:53.334
Yeah, I know it's been a long night.

01:54.293 --> 01:56.253
I work odd hours.
I'm used to it.

01:57.754 --> 01:58.965
You seem pretty tense.

02:01.133 --> 02:03.344
Wouldn't you be?

02:03.427 --> 02:06.305
I don't know what I'd be.
Hard to imagine.

02:07.473 --> 02:08.848
Hard to forget.

02:10.017 --> 02:12.811
How'd the Shlottmans find you?

02:13.854 --> 02:14.981
Referral.

02:15.064 --> 02:16.732
How did you find their daughter?

02:18.650 --> 02:19.818
Followed the clues.

02:19.901 --> 02:22.154
Credit card statements,
couple of interviews.

02:22.238 --> 02:24.906
But at the time of the shooting,
you had an overnight bag with you.

02:24.991 --> 02:27.159
- Is that a question?
- Where were you going?

02:27.243 --> 02:29.036
Pennsylvania.

02:29.120 --> 02:31.705
- What's in Pennsylvania?
- Great antiques.

02:32.623 --> 02:34.125
I love antiques.

02:35.292 --> 02:37.628
- You too, huh?
- The older the better.

02:39.255 --> 02:42.383
Did you know
Hope was going to kill her parents?

02:43.467 --> 02:45.927
If I did, I would have stopped her.

02:47.846 --> 02:49.140
Hmm.

02:52.893 --> 02:56.605
So you assumed she was in her right mind?

02:56.688 --> 02:59.608
Clearly she wasn't,
given the bullets in her parents.

02:59.691 --> 03:02.528
Any idea how a coed from Nebraska
gets hold of a gun?

03:02.611 --> 03:04.446
- Walmart?
- It's unregistered.

03:04.530 --> 03:06.032
Maybe some asshole gave it to her.

03:08.742 --> 03:09.868
Maybe this asshole?

03:14.206 --> 03:15.374
Hmm?

03:18.544 --> 03:20.837
You went into my office
without a search warrant.

03:20.921 --> 03:22.506
It's a part of the crime scene.

03:23.424 --> 03:24.633
How'd your front door get broken?

03:24.716 --> 03:27.844
The door isn't related to the Shlottman
case and neither are these pictures.

03:27.928 --> 03:29.096
I want them back.

03:29.180 --> 03:32.724
My clients expect discretion.
This is bad for business.

03:32.808 --> 03:34.393
So is a double homicide.

03:35.561 --> 03:39.273
I'm licensed.
My paperwork is up to date.

03:39.356 --> 03:41.036
The only thing that you can charge me with

03:41.108 --> 03:44.320
is trying to make a goddamn living
in this goddamn city.

03:45.904 --> 03:47.448
So unless you have something else?

03:50.492 --> 03:51.743
I didn't think so.

04:19.688 --> 04:20.856
Shit.

04:35.371 --> 04:36.538
Yep...

04:38.457 --> 04:39.750
I don't think it's her.

04:39.833 --> 04:41.042
All right, next stop.

04:44.713 --> 04:46.382
We're not open.

04:48.217 --> 04:50.719
I told them that
you had nothing to do with that girl.

04:50.802 --> 04:53.347
I don't need the police up in my shit.

04:53.430 --> 04:55.015
Just let me explain.

05:03.274 --> 05:06.193
How 'bout you start
with why you took those pictures?

05:06.277 --> 05:08.154
I'm a private investigator.

05:08.237 --> 05:09.780
That's the answer to a different question.

05:09.863 --> 05:12.158
- I was hired.
- By who?

05:13.992 --> 05:17.996
By a man who suspected
his wife was cheating on him with you.

05:18.079 --> 05:21.458
I don't mess with married women.
I don't do drama.

05:22.459 --> 05:25.171
- Gina.
- You don't know shit.

05:25.254 --> 05:28.882
I know that she takes her ring off
before she comes to see you.

05:28.965 --> 05:31.718
You can look up
the marriage certificate online.

05:32.803 --> 05:36.265
So that night you came to my place,
that was all just part of this job?

05:37.015 --> 05:38.267
I shouldn't have done that.

05:38.350 --> 05:41.478
Because it's messed up,
or because you got caught?

05:43.063 --> 05:44.815
Both.

05:45.691 --> 05:48.694
Get out of here...
and stay the hell away from me.

05:50.153 --> 05:53.073
- I just...
- I'm serious. Go.

06:09.298 --> 06:13.010
<i>It's better, being alone.</i>

06:13.093 --> 06:14.845
<i>It's safer...</i>

06:14.928 --> 06:16.763
<i>with Kilgrave out there.</i>

06:35.324 --> 06:38.244
<i>He cheated death. How?</i>

07:08.690 --> 07:10.442
Sign in, please, ma'am.

07:22.954 --> 07:24.540
Start at the beginning.

07:27.501 --> 07:28.502
Hope...

07:29.461 --> 07:32.673
you were the last one
to see Kilgrave alive.

07:34.007 --> 07:36.927
Did he tell you anything?
Where he's been?

07:38.053 --> 07:40.013
Why he's back?

07:42.599 --> 07:44.351
Was there anything
about the way he looked?

07:46.227 --> 07:50.356
Where he took you?
Was anyone else there?

07:52.943 --> 07:55.153
God damn it.

07:59.074 --> 08:00.992
Are you a good jumper?

08:02.744 --> 08:03.745
Why?

08:05.080 --> 08:07.207
He made me jump...

08:07.291 --> 08:09.585
for hours, as high as I could.

08:11.587 --> 08:14.756
That was one of my events at school.
Long jump.

08:14.840 --> 08:17.008
I was number two in the state.

08:20.304 --> 08:22.431
He said I was never as good as you.

08:24.391 --> 08:27.811
My brother is all alone now.

08:27.894 --> 08:29.771
He's 12.

08:33.232 --> 08:35.486
It's not your fault.

08:35.568 --> 08:36.945
I know.

08:39.448 --> 08:40.573
It's yours.

08:41.658 --> 08:45.078
He said you left him there to die.

08:45.161 --> 08:47.873
You should have stayed to make sure.

08:48.874 --> 08:50.792
So he's mad.

08:52.002 --> 08:53.169
He wants to make me suffer.

08:53.253 --> 08:55.088
Mmm-hmm.

08:55.171 --> 08:57.549
- Like he suffered.
- How? How did he suffer?

08:57.633 --> 09:00.260
From the accident?
Is he injured?

09:00.344 --> 09:01.887
Hope, I need to know so I can get him.

09:01.970 --> 09:04.848
- No! He'll control you, too!
- Stop it. Stop it!

09:04.931 --> 09:07.267
He'll make you do things!
Terrible things!

09:07.351 --> 09:08.810
Calm down. Hope.

09:10.521 --> 09:12.773
I won't let him, okay?

09:12.856 --> 09:15.484
I won't let him.

09:19.488 --> 09:21.740
You should kill yourself.

09:29.164 --> 09:30.666
Probably.

09:30.749 --> 09:32.668
But I'm the only one
that knows you're innocent.

09:38.214 --> 09:40.133
Some water for you.

09:41.552 --> 09:43.053
You have to take it now, all right?

09:43.136 --> 09:45.138
Okay? Okay?

09:47.391 --> 09:49.768
I'm gonna have to give it to you
if you don't take it. Okay?

09:49.851 --> 09:51.102
Listen to me. Here.

09:51.186 --> 09:52.187
<i>She's guilty.</i>

09:54.272 --> 09:57.984
Mmm. She had a gun in her purse.
It was premeditated.

09:58.068 --> 10:00.278
She aimed it at her parents
and pulled the trigger repeatedly.

10:00.361 --> 10:01.697
She wasn't in control.

10:01.780 --> 10:03.865
If you kill someone while driving drunk,
you're responsible.

10:03.949 --> 10:06.076
- She was abducted.
- Patty Hearst was abducted

10:06.159 --> 10:08.078
and she still got convicted.

10:08.161 --> 10:11.331
- Miss Hogarth, your wife is on line three.
- I'll call back.

10:11.415 --> 10:13.000
Hope Shlottman
is not responsible.

10:13.083 --> 10:14.585
Because she was brainwashed?

10:14.668 --> 10:17.337
Brainwashed, mind-controlled,
whatever you can sell.

10:17.421 --> 10:19.465
- There's nothing to sell.
- How about the truth?

10:19.548 --> 10:22.759
- Pam, what? What is it?
- You have to talk to your wife.

10:22.843 --> 10:24.344
She's yelling.
She's freaking out.

10:24.428 --> 10:27.598
- Hey!
- Take Hope's case.

10:28.432 --> 10:30.266
There is a legal name for cases like hers.

10:30.350 --> 10:31.435
There's precedent?

10:31.518 --> 10:35.188
They're called losers,
and I don't represent losers.

10:35.271 --> 10:37.566
I'll let you know
if any work comes in for you.

10:37.649 --> 10:39.067
Until then, relax.
Get a massage.

10:39.150 --> 10:41.630
I have a great Filipino woman
who will walk all over your back.

10:41.695 --> 10:44.740
- Massages make me tense.
- There's nothing you can do for this girl.

10:45.741 --> 10:47.576
I can prove that Kilgrave exists.

10:47.659 --> 10:50.036
If there really was a man who could
influence people like that,

10:50.120 --> 10:52.330
I would hire him
to do all my jury selection.

10:52.413 --> 10:54.082
God damn it!
This is not a joke.

10:58.795 --> 10:59.796
How?

11:02.215 --> 11:05.886
How will you prove
that this mind controller is real?

11:07.596 --> 11:08.889
I'm resourceful.

11:10.015 --> 11:12.851
But if I can convince you,
will you represent her?

11:17.272 --> 11:18.899
I'll owe you a favor.

11:20.483 --> 11:21.985
Excuse me?

11:23.028 --> 11:26.447
If you do this, I'll owe you a favor.

11:28.408 --> 11:30.661
All right, convince me.

11:40.295 --> 11:43.214
Jeri, talk to your wife.

11:43.298 --> 11:45.425
She knows.

12:01.608 --> 12:03.860
- Wait here. I'll be right back.
- Yeah, sure.

12:04.861 --> 12:07.739
I texted you six times.

12:09.074 --> 12:10.158
My phone's dead.

12:11.367 --> 12:12.661
You were headed out of town.

12:14.830 --> 12:18.584
- Something came up.
- I saw on the news.

12:18.667 --> 12:20.376
I'm scared for you.

12:20.460 --> 12:23.296
Don't... have feelings, okay?

12:23.379 --> 12:25.048
Not okay.

12:25.131 --> 12:27.467
- You need help.
- No, no way.

12:28.635 --> 12:30.345
That's it?

12:30.428 --> 12:34.683
I give you whatever you need,
and you can't even give me a minute?

12:38.478 --> 12:39.605
Okay.

12:47.153 --> 12:48.864
What happened to your door?

12:48.947 --> 12:50.782
Dissatisfied customer.

13:04.129 --> 13:07.465
- Your place is... is cute.
- You think it's a dump.

13:07.548 --> 13:09.843
- I didn't say that.
- I know your voice.

13:20.020 --> 13:22.188
You're not trying to be insulting,
but you're succeeding.

13:22.272 --> 13:24.190
It's not an insult.
It's the cash I owe you.

13:28.111 --> 13:30.906
So now what?
With Kilgrave?

13:33.533 --> 13:35.911
That accident didn't kill him,
but he took a hit.

13:38.288 --> 13:40.081
I find his weakness, I find him.

13:40.165 --> 13:42.417
So you find him. Then what?

13:43.001 --> 13:46.546
I don't know. I find him, I prove
that girl's innocent, he goes away.

13:46.629 --> 13:48.339
Or he controls you again.

13:48.423 --> 13:52.635
- I'll die before I let that happen.
- That's what I'm afraid of.

13:52.719 --> 13:55.430
Listen, I think you should
move in with me again.

13:55.513 --> 14:00.476
I have a security system, a doorman.
I have an actual lock on my door.

14:00.560 --> 14:02.854
You think I'll be safe there?

14:04.064 --> 14:05.857
I'm not safe anywhere.

14:07.734 --> 14:10.320
Every corner I turn,
I don't know what's on the other side.

14:10.403 --> 14:13.782
I don't know who's on the other side.

14:13.865 --> 14:16.626
It could be the cabbie who's gonna
drive me into the East River, okay?

14:16.660 --> 14:17.703
It could be the FedEx woman.

14:17.786 --> 14:20.747
It could be a talk show host
who was my best friend.

14:24.459 --> 14:25.460
Was?

14:26.586 --> 14:28.504
I'm life-threatening, Trish.

14:29.673 --> 14:31.174
Steer clear of me.

14:35.345 --> 14:36.930
- I don't do that.
- Please.

14:37.013 --> 14:39.599
I can't risk you.

15:00.996 --> 15:02.497
It had the name on it.

15:04.374 --> 15:05.375
What?

15:06.960 --> 15:09.087
The door.

15:09.170 --> 15:12.007
Alias Investigations.
I had it made special.

15:15.468 --> 15:16.469
I like it.

15:34.487 --> 15:35.739
Hey, handsome.

15:37.407 --> 15:40.786
Got a Long Island Iced Tea
for a thirsty working woman?

15:40.869 --> 15:41.912
All out.

15:44.956 --> 15:47.542
So we skip the drinking part,
go straight upstairs.

15:48.752 --> 15:50.628
I don't play with liars.

15:51.462 --> 15:54.007
We've never talked long enough
for me to lie to you.

15:54.090 --> 15:56.634
Too busy taking our clothes off.

15:56.717 --> 15:59.470
You could put your wedding ring back on.

16:03.141 --> 16:04.810
So, I'm married.

16:06.269 --> 16:07.938
I'm just a booty call for you, anyway.

16:08.021 --> 16:09.981
I stay away from complications.

16:10.065 --> 16:13.693
My marriage is over.
We don't even do oral anymore.

16:13.777 --> 16:15.904
I really... I don't wanna hear it.

16:15.987 --> 16:19.324
Trust me, Andre doesn't know or care.

16:19.407 --> 16:21.247
He cared enough
to hire a private investigator.

16:21.326 --> 16:24.704
- What?
- Jessica Jones. She's good.

16:24.788 --> 16:26.664
I've seen the pictures.

16:27.665 --> 16:30.251
I don't believe you.
Andre would never...

16:30.335 --> 16:33.588
- Go home and ask him.
- Luke.

16:33.671 --> 16:34.881
Door's right there.

16:38.802 --> 16:40.220
Jesus Christ.

16:41.721 --> 16:43.389
Jesus.

18:00.508 --> 18:03.386
- Is that real or is it just in my head?
- Both.

18:11.436 --> 18:13.479
Did you even wash your hands?

18:13.563 --> 18:15.565
Did you wash your hands?

18:15.648 --> 18:17.317
We're gonna get salmonella!

18:17.400 --> 18:19.652
The whole kitchen's gonna get
salmonella, you...

18:21.362 --> 18:22.363
Just get the door!

18:22.447 --> 18:24.574
We're not cooking this
for anyone else. It's just us.

18:26.367 --> 18:27.577
Shut up.

18:27.660 --> 18:30.580
Mind your own business, lush.

18:30.663 --> 18:33.416
Your business is my business
when I have to listen to it.

18:33.499 --> 18:36.752
Oh, like we had to listen to glass
shattering from your place the other day?

18:36.836 --> 18:38.964
Hey, why don't we ask her?

18:39.047 --> 18:43.801
'Cause she clearly doesn't understand
jack about cordon blue.

18:43.884 --> 18:45.636
It's French for "chicken."

18:45.720 --> 18:47.137
But she can be the deciding vote.

18:47.222 --> 18:48.982
- Zip it, Pooh Bear.
- Everybody just zip it!

18:49.057 --> 18:50.350
Go to hell!

18:55.063 --> 18:57.732
- You know why I live alone?
- People don't like you?

18:57.815 --> 18:59.734
People distract me.

18:59.817 --> 19:02.445
Now, I don't give a bag of dicks
what kinky shit you're into.

19:02.528 --> 19:04.030
Just be into it quietly.

19:09.077 --> 19:10.620
Self-respect.

19:10.703 --> 19:11.829
Get some.

19:13.999 --> 19:15.375
Help me up!

19:17.710 --> 19:19.337
Come on, get inside.

19:20.296 --> 19:21.547
You're naked.

19:45.821 --> 19:47.156
Come back here!

19:48.408 --> 19:49.409
Jessica?

19:53.871 --> 19:54.998
Now, Jessica!

20:23.359 --> 20:26.529
Hey, uh, if I get hit by a bus,
where's the closest hospital?

20:26.612 --> 20:29.115
Stay on sidewalk,
you don't get hit by bus.

20:29.865 --> 20:31.659
Thanks, I'll find out myself.

20:31.742 --> 20:35.038
Hey, uh, everyone go to Metro-General.
Six blocks that way.

20:36.789 --> 20:38.249
Hey, you're welcome.

20:41.044 --> 20:44.672
- Rude girl is lonely girl!
- Countin' on it.

20:44.755 --> 20:47.508
<i>Doctor Keller,
dial one-three-one.</i>

20:47.592 --> 20:49.802
<i>Doctor Keller,
dial one-three-one.</i>

21:05.025 --> 21:06.145
I don't see that name, guys.

21:06.194 --> 21:07.946
Take another look.
Yeah, name's Wilson.

21:08.028 --> 21:09.655
Just take a look for me, all right,
would you? Okay?

21:09.739 --> 21:11.019
- It's got to be here.
- Mmm-mmm.

21:52.698 --> 21:53.824
Ugh.

22:00.540 --> 22:02.708
Jesus.

22:27.733 --> 22:28.734
Excuse me?

22:28.818 --> 22:30.945
Sorry, I got a fecal situation in 602.

22:31.028 --> 22:34.407
This is my first day. I can't mess it up.
Dr. Carter already hates me.

22:34.490 --> 22:36.158
Dr. Carter?

22:36.242 --> 22:39.412
He's the new Head of Oncology. Please.

22:39.495 --> 22:41.872
Well, just...
Ugh, make it quick.

22:41.956 --> 22:45.084
It's this computer system.
It's nothing like my old hospital.

22:45.167 --> 22:48.003
- Where you from?
- Seattle Grace.

22:48.087 --> 22:49.589
Like on TV?

22:50.215 --> 22:53.509
I'm looking for emergency room records.
You know, people who came through.

22:54.469 --> 22:56.429
Why does a cancer doctor need ER records?

22:57.847 --> 23:00.182
I didn't ask.

23:00.266 --> 23:03.436
You know, he's probably testing you.
They pull that crap sometimes.

23:03.519 --> 23:06.647
Yeah. There was a bus crash a year ago.

23:06.731 --> 23:08.983
He wants all the info
on a John Doe that came through.

23:09.066 --> 23:11.902
- Just give me the date.
- January 20th.

23:16.282 --> 23:19.452
Uh, looks like it was a slow night.

23:19.535 --> 23:22.747
One Charles Wallace, 51,
cuts and bruises. The driver.

23:22.830 --> 23:24.915
One woman, DOA.

23:24.999 --> 23:29.545
No John Doe.
That's all she wrote on January 20th.

23:29.629 --> 23:32.257
I should probably
print the whole file for that accident.

23:32.340 --> 23:35.175
Yeah, live your life, woman.
I gotta go clean up some shit.

24:39.324 --> 24:41.451
Who sent you?

24:42.493 --> 24:43.869
My leg!

24:43.953 --> 24:45.079
Shit!

24:47.247 --> 24:48.833
Who sent you?

24:48.916 --> 24:51.877
What the hell?
I'm bleedin'!

24:51.961 --> 24:53.671
- Who sent you?
- Patricia Walker!

24:54.547 --> 24:56.090
She hired me to fix your door.

24:57.675 --> 24:59.885
Jesus, lady!
You're a lunatic!

24:59.969 --> 25:01.846
- Sorry.
- I'm bleedin' here!

25:01.929 --> 25:03.556
- Here.
- Get away from me!

25:04.390 --> 25:07.477
And call a goddamn ambulance.

25:12.773 --> 25:15.318
What the hell were you thinking?
I almost killed him.

25:15.401 --> 25:17.528
<i>I left you a message.
Check your phone.</i>

25:17.612 --> 25:19.292
I could get slapped
with an assault charge.

25:19.364 --> 25:21.782
Adam won't press charges
if I pay for his medical care.

25:21.866 --> 25:24.410
<i>Christ, do you have to control everything?</i>

25:24.494 --> 25:27.329
No, of course not.
Not this one, no.

25:27.413 --> 25:30.375
Please, Trish, listen to me.

25:30.458 --> 25:32.334
Don't call, don't visit,

25:32.418 --> 25:36.046
<i>and don't send strange men
to my apartment with power tools.</i>

25:36.130 --> 25:38.674
You might wanna cover up.

25:41.469 --> 25:43.679
Jess, your door needs to lock.

25:43.763 --> 25:46.098
<i>- I'll handle it.</i>
- No, you won't.

25:46.181 --> 25:47.767
Oh, my God, you're relentless.

25:47.850 --> 25:50.269
<i>- Well, I take that as a compliment.</i>
- Then you heard it wrong.

25:50.352 --> 25:51.479
<i>Okay, try this.</i>

25:51.562 --> 25:53.230
"Thanks, Trish, for fixing my door.

25:53.313 --> 25:56.275
It was very thoughtful of you,
given there's a maniac on the loose."

25:56.358 --> 25:59.445
Back off, all right?
God, you're turning into your mother.

26:00.988 --> 26:02.197
Wow.

26:03.157 --> 26:04.324
Low blow, Jess.

26:05.951 --> 26:07.620
<i>Even for you.</i>

26:08.746 --> 26:11.874
A lot of guys leave your office
on stretchers, huh?

26:11.957 --> 26:13.793
Sorry about the noise last night.

26:13.876 --> 26:17.422
But you sure calmed Robyn down.
Not even our parents could do that.

26:19.715 --> 26:23.594
- She's your sister?
- We're twins. Fraternal.

26:40.152 --> 26:42.196
You are very strong.

26:56.251 --> 26:58.628
<i>42nd Street,
Port Authority Bus Terminal.</i>

26:59.880 --> 27:01.298
<i>Next stop, 50th Street.</i>

27:36.501 --> 27:38.043
Come back here!

27:56.646 --> 27:58.648
Birch Street.

27:58.731 --> 28:00.566
Main Street.

28:00.650 --> 28:02.943
Higgins Drive.

28:03.027 --> 28:04.069
Cobalt Lane.

28:17.667 --> 28:19.877
Looking for something?

28:19.960 --> 28:22.212
I'm looking for Jack Denton.

28:22.296 --> 28:25.800
- What do you want with him?
- Just to talk. Is he home?

28:25.883 --> 28:27.885
Who are you?

28:27.968 --> 28:31.055
I'm an investigator from City Transit.
I'm looking into an accident.

28:31.138 --> 28:33.348
A bus crash?

28:33.432 --> 28:36.644
Two ambulances were dispatched.
Jack was the driver of one of them.

28:37.311 --> 28:40.565
My Jackie's got nothing to say
to you people.

28:40.648 --> 28:42.274
Turning your backs on him.

28:44.735 --> 28:46.946
I know that Jack went
to the accident scene,

28:47.029 --> 28:49.489
and then from there,
he just drove off with the ambulance.

28:49.574 --> 28:51.909
He went AWOL.
Never explained why.

28:51.992 --> 28:53.368
You know a lot, huh?

28:53.452 --> 28:55.705
It's my job to know things.

28:57.164 --> 29:00.334
I know that Jack was denied worker's comp
because he stole the ambulance.

29:00.417 --> 29:02.211
They got it back.

29:02.294 --> 29:04.129
If I could understand what happened,

29:04.213 --> 29:08.551
I may be able to pull some strings
and reverse the ruling.

29:12.096 --> 29:13.681
Maybe God sent you.

29:14.974 --> 29:17.142
Maybe he didn't.

29:35.119 --> 29:38.122
- This wasn't in his file.
- He had a stroke.

29:38.205 --> 29:40.540
He's too young for a stroke.

29:40.625 --> 29:43.293
They think his body went into shock
after the surgery...

29:44.670 --> 29:46.797
when he donated his kidneys.

29:47.632 --> 29:49.884
Kidneys, plural?
Both of them?

29:49.967 --> 29:51.886
So selfless and brave.

29:52.678 --> 29:55.931
After the shenanigans
with the ambulance...

29:56.015 --> 29:58.183
Jackie disappeared for three weeks.

29:59.268 --> 30:00.708
Then I get a call from the hospital.

30:00.770 --> 30:06.066
They found him in an alley,
half-dead because of his sacrifice.

30:06.150 --> 30:09.319
Oh, the Lord
is an incredible maker of lives.

30:10.112 --> 30:14.449
For years,
I prayed he'd send Jack back home.

30:14.533 --> 30:17.077
I'd lost my son.
He was on liquor all the time.

30:17.161 --> 30:21.540
So I prayed for his return,
and here he is.

30:21.624 --> 30:23.500
My prayers were answered.

30:23.583 --> 30:26.170
Well, not like I had expected, surely.

30:27.212 --> 30:30.841
You can never see God coming.
Pray with us.

30:30.925 --> 30:33.218
I'm just getting over a cold.

30:35.638 --> 30:38.974
Is he on that thing all the time?
That looks expensive.

30:39.058 --> 30:41.018
I think it is.

30:41.101 --> 30:43.896
An anonymous angel sent it to us.

30:43.979 --> 30:47.566
Some donor in the city, I don't know.
But God bless him.

30:49.193 --> 30:50.833
Could I trouble you for a glass of water?

30:50.861 --> 30:53.072
Oh.

30:53.155 --> 30:55.825
Don't you be flirting with my boy.

30:55.908 --> 30:59.494
Don't get him excited.
I know the girls always liked him.

31:18.305 --> 31:19.556
God didn't do this.

31:21.684 --> 31:23.060
The devil did...

31:24.103 --> 31:25.562
and I'm gonna find him.

31:46.458 --> 31:49.837
Kilgrave, I know.
Do you know where he is?

32:04.559 --> 32:05.644
I can't.

32:08.438 --> 32:09.648
I can't do that.

32:15.695 --> 32:17.114
You've upset him.

32:21.285 --> 32:23.162
It's okay, Jackie.
I'm here.

32:24.038 --> 32:27.457
- I'm sorry.
- God is with us. It's okay.

32:33.172 --> 32:36.466
It's a Baxter hemodialysis machine.

32:37.217 --> 32:40.345
Serial number's JX376F.

32:41.471 --> 32:46.018
Don't you have somebody on call for that
in case of emergencies?

32:46.101 --> 32:47.853
What kind of service is that?

32:48.771 --> 32:52.400
Fine.
What time do you open?

32:52.482 --> 32:54.777
Have them give me a call.

32:54.860 --> 32:58.280
Yeah, at the number I gave you.
Thank you.

32:58.363 --> 32:59.990
Hi.

33:00.074 --> 33:02.659
Hands off my brother, cougar.

33:02.742 --> 33:07.331
You're all alone, so you have to
pick away at other people's happiness.

33:08.248 --> 33:09.708
You're not all that.

33:11.626 --> 33:12.627
Get over here.

33:12.711 --> 33:16.673
Lady, you're a very perceptive asshole.

33:58.465 --> 34:01.051
- Jessica Jones?
- Can I help you?

34:02.761 --> 34:05.222
Solve this, P.I. lady.

34:05.305 --> 34:09.309
Since my husband didn't hire you
to follow me, who the hell did?

34:09.393 --> 34:11.436
I'm sorry, I don't discuss cases.

34:11.520 --> 34:13.188
You took pictures.

34:14.648 --> 34:17.400
It's called "private investigations"
for a reason.

34:17.484 --> 34:20.154
All I can think is you hired yourself

34:20.237 --> 34:23.282
to get rid of Luke's women,
thin out the competition.

34:23.364 --> 34:25.574
You jealous?
Some kind of stalker?

34:25.659 --> 34:27.577
I'm not a stalker.

34:27.661 --> 34:29.288
Luke said Andre knew.

34:30.164 --> 34:34.668
'Course, he knows now that
I asked him about it.

34:34.751 --> 34:36.879
Look, I'm sorry that you
screwed up your marriage, but...

34:36.962 --> 34:39.339
You screwed it up, digging around.

34:39.422 --> 34:41.632
And all you've done
is get Luke's ass kicked.

34:42.342 --> 34:43.385
How's that?

34:44.761 --> 34:47.514
You want him?
You got him.

34:48.306 --> 34:49.975
- Ow!
- Don't mess with me, lady.

34:50.059 --> 34:52.436
Andre plays in a rugby league.

34:52.518 --> 34:55.359
He got his team buddies all worked up.
Now they're headed to Luke's bar.

34:57.107 --> 34:58.275
Happy?

35:00.610 --> 35:02.029
Shit.

35:08.452 --> 35:10.620
- You Luke?
- Andre, that's him.

35:12.122 --> 35:14.792
Guys, I don't want any problems.
I just want you to leave the bar.

35:14.874 --> 35:15.917
You're gonna have to kick us out.

35:16.001 --> 35:17.753
Look, I don't want any trouble.
Get out of the bar.

35:17.836 --> 35:20.630
If you didn't want trouble,
you shouldn't have slept with my wife.

36:00.629 --> 36:01.880
Psycho bitch.

36:10.055 --> 36:11.723
It didn't cut.

36:13.600 --> 36:17.437
You're drunk. Your mind's not right.
Go home to your wife.

36:17.521 --> 36:18.522
You've ruined my life.

36:18.605 --> 36:20.482
I'll do worse, I see your face again.

36:21.191 --> 36:23.068
Sleep it off.
Forget you were here.

36:23.152 --> 36:24.944
I'll do the same.

36:38.500 --> 36:39.501
What the hell was that?

36:41.003 --> 36:42.504
Team work?

36:43.588 --> 36:46.633
Free shots for everybody.

36:47.676 --> 36:50.220
Get out of here.
Shit's bad for business.

37:15.995 --> 37:16.996
What?

37:19.333 --> 37:21.460
Hi. Yes.

37:21.543 --> 37:24.504
Yes, I did call about the kidney machine.

37:24.588 --> 37:25.839
Um...

37:25.922 --> 37:28.800
It's not... dialysizing.

37:30.760 --> 37:33.347
Yeah, I need to reach the person
who leases the machine,

37:33.430 --> 37:35.224
so he can authorize the service.

37:36.641 --> 37:38.727
Yeah, hang on.
Just one second.

37:41.020 --> 37:45.567
Okay. Dr. David Kurata.

37:49.196 --> 37:50.864
Okay, thank you.

38:01.583 --> 38:07.589
The average score of the multiple choice
section was a staggering...

38:07.672 --> 38:11.635
62%.

38:14.429 --> 38:16.848
So, if you don't know
the difference between

38:16.931 --> 38:18.517
an allele and a chromosome by now...

38:19.684 --> 38:22.437
there's nothing I can do for you.

38:25.274 --> 38:26.358
The, uh...

38:27.859 --> 38:28.985
Um...

38:29.861 --> 38:31.655
The short essay questions

38:31.738 --> 38:35.534
were worth five points each, um...

38:36.118 --> 38:39.996
but because there are six questions
that account for 25...

38:55.387 --> 38:56.763
Hey!

39:43.643 --> 39:44.811
Dr. Kurata?

39:48.523 --> 39:52.736
Look, you obviously think
I'm going to do something to you.

39:52.819 --> 39:54.153
I'm not.

39:55.780 --> 39:57.657
You don't even know me.

39:59.826 --> 40:01.578
Okay, I'll start.

40:02.662 --> 40:05.332
You were the best transplant surgeon
in the Tri-State Area

40:05.415 --> 40:08.460
and now you're dissecting frogs
with undergrads.

40:10.504 --> 40:11.713
You're hiding.

40:13.548 --> 40:14.591
Why?

40:15.884 --> 40:17.343
Is he here?

40:18.303 --> 40:20.514
Who? Kilgrave?

40:22.349 --> 40:25.560
He's dead, according to
the death certificate that you forged.

40:26.895 --> 40:29.230
Is he with you?

40:29.314 --> 40:31.358
Why would he be with me?

40:31.441 --> 40:32.985
He had pictures of you.

40:34.027 --> 40:35.612
He was obsessed.

40:37.822 --> 40:39.198
He's not here.

40:46.164 --> 40:49.376
You did a surgery on the EMT, Jack Denton.

40:49.459 --> 40:51.378
- He made me.
- I know.

40:51.461 --> 40:53.630
Why?

40:53.713 --> 40:56.341
What shape was Kilgrave in?
How badly hurt?

40:56.425 --> 40:59.761
One of his kidneys had been destroyed
in an accident.

40:59.844 --> 41:03.598
The other one started to break down.
It's known as crush syndrome.

41:03.682 --> 41:06.017
- So he grabbed you.
- The EMT did.

41:06.768 --> 41:09.938
I told Kilgrave
that he could survive with one kidney,

41:10.021 --> 41:12.399
but he wanted to be made whole again.

41:12.482 --> 41:15.402
- Jack happened to be a match?
- Any kidney can work temporarily.

41:15.485 --> 41:18.280
He'll have to maim someone else
in a couple years.

41:18.363 --> 41:20.615
No other weaknesses?
Injuries?

41:21.991 --> 41:24.953
I've never seen such strong will.

41:25.036 --> 41:28.164
Ten hours of surgery.
Kilgrave watched me the entire time.

41:28.247 --> 41:30.124
He was awake?
No anesthesia?

41:30.208 --> 41:33.002
He did the whole thing with an epidural.
He refused to be put under.

41:33.086 --> 41:35.464
He's a lot of things
and a masochist isn't one of them.

41:36.465 --> 41:39.593
He didn't want to be unconscious.

41:39.676 --> 41:42.721
- But he sleeps.
- It's different.

41:42.804 --> 41:45.932
Surgical anesthesia,
like Propofol or Sufentanil,

41:46.015 --> 41:47.726
it shuts down different functions.

41:51.605 --> 41:54.358
That's it.
That's his weakness.

41:59.988 --> 42:01.323
Jeri Hogarth, please.

42:01.406 --> 42:03.032
She's an attorney.
You're gonna tell her what happened.

42:03.116 --> 42:04.493
- No!
- Yes!

42:04.576 --> 42:06.661
What exactly do you have left to lose?

42:07.704 --> 42:09.288
My mind.

42:10.332 --> 42:11.583
<i>Hello.</i>

42:13.835 --> 42:15.337
I'm sorry, but this is happening.

42:15.420 --> 42:17.255
You're gonna help people again,
starting with me.

42:17.339 --> 42:21.343
<i>- Jessica, is that you?</i>
- Hogarth, meet Dr. Kurata.

42:23.887 --> 42:26.473
Start at the beginning.

42:52.081 --> 42:54.292
I'm your new attorney.

42:59.297 --> 43:01.466
You should be more excited.

43:01.550 --> 43:03.468
You stick with the public defender
that they've assigned you

43:03.552 --> 43:06.721
and you'll end up spending
your next two lifetimes behind bars.

43:09.849 --> 43:11.685
Jessica Jones sent me.

43:14.813 --> 43:18.817
There is a possibility that your claims
might be corroborated by another victim.

43:19.943 --> 43:22.987
Looks like you're a mascot
for a macabre club.

43:23.071 --> 43:25.364
There are others?

43:25.449 --> 43:27.283
Besides Jessica?

43:31.329 --> 43:33.665
Why don't you walk me through it, yeah?

45:03.588 --> 45:05.549
The font logo is different on the window.

45:05.632 --> 45:09.719
- Well, I didn't see the old one.
<i>- It was different.</i>

45:09.803 --> 45:11.763
The one I chose is better.

45:12.847 --> 45:14.891
I don't need your protection anymore.

45:14.974 --> 45:16.851
I wasn't protecting you.

45:16.935 --> 45:19.813
<i>You're cutting me out
so you don't have to worry about me.</i>

45:19.896 --> 45:23.066
- That's not...
- Yeah, it is, and...

45:24.859 --> 45:27.571
I'm telling you, don't.

45:28.988 --> 45:30.239
I don't need it.

45:30.323 --> 45:31.908
<i>I don't want it.</i>

45:33.326 --> 45:37.622
Okay, well, in that case, do you wanna,
you know, grab a drink or something?

45:37.706 --> 45:38.832
Uh...

45:40.041 --> 45:41.125
Uh...

45:41.209 --> 45:43.920
I left my trainer waiting.
I'm exercising.

45:44.963 --> 45:48.091
<i>Yoga's not exercising, it's stretching.</i>

45:48.174 --> 45:50.301
We'll grab lunch later this week, okay?

45:51.010 --> 45:53.262
<i>- I'll call you.</i>
- Okay.

45:53.346 --> 45:55.139
And I'm nothing like my mother.

45:55.223 --> 45:58.142
- You have her cheekbones.
<i>- Nope. Nothing.</i>

45:58.226 --> 46:00.144
Look in the mirror.

46:00.228 --> 46:02.939
<i>All right, so I'm a little like her.</i>

46:03.022 --> 46:05.066
<i>Namaste.</i>

46:12.281 --> 46:14.408
Let's do it again.
I didn't get it right.

46:14.492 --> 46:16.828
- No, you had enough.
- No, I want to go again.

46:23.918 --> 46:25.253
Nice. That was good.

46:25.336 --> 46:27.256
No, I heard it click.
I would have died. Come on.

46:28.632 --> 46:29.883
Again.

46:34.262 --> 46:36.514
Nice. Better.

46:51.821 --> 46:54.615
- Yes?
- You'd like to invite me in.

46:57.076 --> 46:58.411
Absolutely.

47:07.336 --> 47:09.297
Honey, who's this?

47:09.380 --> 47:11.883
I'm gonna be your guest here,
indefinitely.

47:11.966 --> 47:13.760
You'll be delighted.

47:13.843 --> 47:15.594
Great. Enjoy the view.

47:15.679 --> 47:17.972
I intend to.

47:20.975 --> 47:23.269
That's my car.

47:23.352 --> 47:26.064
Children should be seen and not heard.

47:27.148 --> 47:31.986
Or better still, not seen and not heard.
Get into that closet.

47:39.577 --> 47:41.788
- You, too.
- I have to go to the bathroom.

47:41.871 --> 47:44.290
Go in the closet.
It'll be fine.

47:58.054 --> 48:00.807
- What are you doing?
- They'll be fine.

48:00.890 --> 48:01.933
They'll be fine.

48:03.893 --> 48:05.770
What's for dinner?

48:05.854 --> 48:08.482
- Leg of lamb.
- It's his specialty.

48:08.564 --> 48:10.108
Let me decide that.

48:11.776 --> 48:15.446
Be warned.
I have a very particular palate.

48:24.789 --> 48:28.585
<i>My greatest weakness?
Occasionally, I give a damn.</i>

48:29.668 --> 48:31.295
<i>And Kilgrave knows it.</i>

48:46.269 --> 48:47.771
<i>But now I know his.</i>

48:51.065 --> 48:52.316
<i>Game on.</i>

49:02.451 --> 49:04.037
I saw you.

49:06.705 --> 49:09.042
Well, that's what happens when you
break into someone's apartment

49:09.125 --> 49:10.960
when they're getting dressed.

49:11.044 --> 49:14.338
You tossed a man twice your size
across the bar with one hand.

49:15.548 --> 49:17.383
Adrenaline kicked in.

49:17.466 --> 49:20.970
I saw you and you saw me.

49:21.054 --> 49:24.223
- I don't know what I saw.
- You know.

49:25.850 --> 49:28.102
- You've known for a while.
- You're wrong.

49:29.437 --> 49:30.729
That's not...

49:32.690 --> 49:35.068
I just went there to fix things.

50:21.405 --> 50:23.366
You can't fix me.

50:27.495 --> 50:29.080
I'm unbreakable.
