WEBVTT

00:02.045 --> 00:03.438
<i>Previously onRoswell, New Mexico...</i>

00:03.481 --> 00:04.917
I don't understand, Liz.

00:04.961 --> 00:06.310
How did she even
end up in a coma?

00:06.354 --> 00:08.225
She's in there somewhere.
I'm gonna find her.

00:08.269 --> 00:09.313
You don't just hear things.

00:09.357 --> 00:10.749
<i>Your ears are detecting</i>

00:10.793 --> 00:12.316
<i>subatomic vibrational frequencies.</i>

00:12.360 --> 00:13.491
<i>Jones must have found his sword</i>

00:13.535 --> 00:15.102
<i>that Max buried in the desert</i>

00:15.145 --> 00:16.494
<i>and is now using it
to kill people</i>

00:16.538 --> 00:18.105
<i>in order
to charge himself back up.</i>

00:18.148 --> 00:19.845
Yeah, but why does
he need the sword?

00:19.889 --> 00:21.499
Max said,
when he held the sword,

00:21.543 --> 00:23.632
it made him feel charged
and powerful.

00:25.199 --> 00:28.202
Michael, don't! How are
you able to hold that thing?

00:28.245 --> 00:31.031
You're my... Hello, son.

00:31.074 --> 00:33.337
I don't think Max is Max.

00:33.381 --> 00:34.860
Because he's not.

00:34.904 --> 00:36.079
He's Jones.

00:36.123 --> 00:37.515
Where are you taking me?

00:40.127 --> 00:43.608
March 11, 1969.

00:48.091 --> 00:49.353
What are you talking
about, Jones?

00:49.397 --> 00:50.920
After a thorough read

00:50.963 --> 00:54.532
of Tripp's journal
and files from Caulfield Prison,

00:54.576 --> 00:57.883
I learned
that an Oasian I sought

00:57.927 --> 01:00.756
was locked up there long ago.

01:00.799 --> 01:02.149
And on this day,

01:02.192 --> 01:03.889
March 11, 1969,

01:03.933 --> 01:05.978
your grandmother, Patricia,

01:06.022 --> 01:07.371
met that alien

01:07.415 --> 01:09.286
within those torturous walls.

01:09.330 --> 01:10.940
I don't know how
to call up that memory.

01:10.983 --> 01:13.943
Which is why you're going to
relive every moment of her day

01:13.986 --> 01:16.163
until she comes into possession

01:16.206 --> 01:18.165
of a very important equation

01:18.208 --> 01:19.818
on some alien glass.

01:19.862 --> 01:21.646
I'm not helping you see...

01:21.690 --> 01:24.214
It amuses me that you think you
have any control in the matter.

01:24.258 --> 01:26.216
Do you think you ended up

01:26.260 --> 01:27.783
in this diner by accident?

01:27.826 --> 01:29.219
I put you here.

01:29.263 --> 01:32.179
Because Patricia started
her day in that stool,

01:32.222 --> 01:33.441
sipping this cup
of coffee.

01:33.484 --> 01:35.399
I'll hold the line.

01:35.443 --> 01:36.748
My friends will come get me out,

01:36.792 --> 01:38.446
and then we'll kick
your alien ass...

01:38.489 --> 01:40.535
Is this the same lot
that you put your faith in

01:40.578 --> 01:43.190
to keep me
from tearing into your mind?

01:44.016 --> 01:45.409
Now, I may be
in control,

01:45.453 --> 01:48.673
but I'm hoping this endeavor
can be a cordial one.

01:50.980 --> 01:52.416
Cordial. Right.

01:52.460 --> 01:54.462
I'd rather go down swinging.

02:05.255 --> 02:07.388
Seeing that piece of glass

02:07.431 --> 02:09.868
is the most important
thing to me

02:09.912 --> 02:13.002
on this wretched planet.

02:13.045 --> 02:16.092
So either walk
Patricia's path

02:16.136 --> 02:19.269
or I never let you
wake up.

02:30.454 --> 02:32.630
<i>This has to work.</i>

02:32.674 --> 02:34.197
Well, Michael's
secured a work space,

02:34.241 --> 02:35.720
and Isobel has used
her persuasive wiles

02:35.764 --> 02:36.808
to nab a few

02:36.852 --> 02:38.462
hard-to-acquire
- chemicals.
- Good.

02:38.506 --> 02:40.116
Because the last cultures
I took from Maria showed

02:40.160 --> 02:41.335
that Jones'
invasive cells

02:41.378 --> 02:42.771
are effectively
consuming her.

02:42.814 --> 02:44.468
Think sepsis then organ failure
then endocrine

02:44.512 --> 02:45.774
then nervous system.

02:45.817 --> 02:47.558
Meaning that her ability
to fight him off

02:47.602 --> 02:49.560
- just slows to a crawl.
- Mm-hmm.

02:49.604 --> 02:51.649
Even if modern
medicine stumbled

02:51.693 --> 02:52.998
upon something that could help,

02:53.042 --> 02:54.391
a glowing handprint

02:54.435 --> 02:56.088
spiderwebbing across her body--
I mean,

02:56.132 --> 02:57.264
it's gonna raise some eyebrows
we've been working hard

02:57.307 --> 02:58.874
to keep unraised.

02:58.917 --> 03:01.181
Yeah. And you can't exactly
perform alien science

03:01.224 --> 03:02.312
under the nose of the hospital

03:02.356 --> 03:03.835
or where Jones can find us.

03:03.879 --> 03:05.272
Like I said,

03:05.315 --> 03:06.534
this has to work.

03:06.577 --> 03:08.492
- Hi.
- Hi.

03:08.536 --> 03:10.494
Transfer papers?
For a coma patient,

03:10.538 --> 03:12.670
it's not something
we typically rush.

03:12.714 --> 03:14.019
Well, the military hospital
is strategizing her care

03:14.063 --> 03:15.282
as we speak.

03:15.325 --> 03:16.761
I can get Dr. Holden
on the phone

03:16.805 --> 03:17.893
if need be.

03:17.936 --> 03:19.677
Jane Holden assigned
the transfer?

03:19.721 --> 03:21.592
I see that you've had
the pleasure of meeting her.

03:21.636 --> 03:23.246
Never in person, but...

03:23.290 --> 03:24.943
refusal to honor her requests

03:24.987 --> 03:26.206
tends to make my week

03:26.249 --> 03:27.859
far from easy.

03:27.903 --> 03:31.211
Well, seeing that you're now
in control of how the rest

03:31.254 --> 03:32.951
of both
of our weeks go,

03:32.995 --> 03:34.388
I really hope you'll sign.

03:40.394 --> 03:42.047
DeLuca is cleared for transfer.

03:42.091 --> 03:43.310
Thank you, ma'am.

03:43.353 --> 03:45.312
Saved us both a hell
of a tongue-lashing.

03:47.314 --> 03:48.706
Where'd you find
this place?

03:48.750 --> 03:51.056
The owner is

03:51.100 --> 03:52.884
a poker pal of Sanders.

03:52.928 --> 03:54.886
He's a large animal vet
out on a call today.

03:54.930 --> 03:57.498
You got all the bells
and whistles of a hospital

03:57.541 --> 03:59.326
with none of the nosy staff.

03:59.369 --> 04:00.457
All right,
Ortecho,

04:00.501 --> 04:02.154
you got it from here. I'm out.

04:02.198 --> 04:03.678
Hey. Where you going?

04:03.721 --> 04:05.941
Well, wherever Jones is,
the pod with his body is, too.

04:05.984 --> 04:07.247
I'm going to get us

04:07.290 --> 04:09.118
some leverage
in this cosmic chess game.

04:09.161 --> 04:10.554
You going after that sword, too?

04:10.598 --> 04:13.296
Considering it makes him
pretty much unbeatable,

04:13.340 --> 04:14.428
I think grabbing it
could be effective

04:14.471 --> 04:15.559
in saving Maria and Max.

04:15.603 --> 04:17.126
No, that sounds crazy dangerous.

04:17.169 --> 04:19.259
Luckily, both are my specialty.

04:19.302 --> 04:21.261
Let me know when you
got word on Maria.

04:22.436 --> 04:24.438
I got this.

04:29.617 --> 04:30.835
Don't have time for the dance.

04:30.879 --> 04:32.576
- Well, I'm not here to debate.
- Mm.

04:32.620 --> 04:34.012
I'm here to inform.

04:35.492 --> 04:36.841
We are working
together today.

04:36.885 --> 04:38.756
And that means we're
gonna be strategic.

04:38.800 --> 04:40.236
And the best part is no one's
gonna do anything stupid.

04:40.280 --> 04:42.151
And by "nobody," I mean you.

04:42.194 --> 04:45.285
Mm. We're gonna work together?

04:45.328 --> 04:46.982
Like the other day
at the radio tower?

04:48.157 --> 04:50.594
I know I was right
about Kyle and the dead bats,

04:50.638 --> 04:51.943
but you said it was all nothing.

04:56.034 --> 05:00.430
No offense, I can only handle
one liar at a time.

05:00.474 --> 05:02.824
And today I got to take it
from my Daddy Dictator.

05:03.651 --> 05:05.392
I joined Deep Sky.

05:07.524 --> 05:10.658
You joined the evil group
after Cameron's sister.

05:10.701 --> 05:13.356
Charlie never said that Deep
Sky was after her. My dad did.

05:13.400 --> 05:16.054
And my dad hated Deep Sky
because it stood for everything

05:16.098 --> 05:18.100
- that he didn't.
- Hmm.

05:18.143 --> 05:20.537
Well, I'm glad you found
a way to fight your dad.

05:20.581 --> 05:22.583
But I got to find
a way to fight mine.

05:22.626 --> 05:26.326
I joined Deep Sky
for you, Michael.

05:26.369 --> 05:29.198
This world where you
don't live in fear

05:29.241 --> 05:30.330
is not gonna build itself.

05:30.373 --> 05:31.592
So I have to try.

05:32.984 --> 05:34.899
For us.

05:36.205 --> 05:37.598
I don't know what to say.

05:37.641 --> 05:39.469
Well, you can start by saying

05:39.513 --> 05:41.123
that if I help you
find your father,

05:41.166 --> 05:42.646
that we do it my way.

05:42.690 --> 05:44.909
All tactical. Not emotional.

05:44.953 --> 05:47.782
I plan the mission
to extract Max's pod.

05:47.825 --> 05:49.392
No sword.

05:52.569 --> 05:55.529
You picked a hell of a time
for a grand gesture, Manes.

05:59.968 --> 06:01.839
A Post-it Note
on the fridge

06:01.883 --> 06:03.363
telling me to
take it easy.

06:03.406 --> 06:04.668
Really?

06:04.712 --> 06:06.540
I know, I know.
I'm sorry. I just...

06:06.583 --> 06:07.715
I can't get distracted today.

06:07.758 --> 06:09.499
Okay? You can sit
this one out.

06:09.543 --> 06:13.198
No. Look, after I was talking
to Michael about my new powers,

06:13.242 --> 06:15.766
I kind of went down this
rabbit hole and I found out

06:15.810 --> 06:17.986
that everything
in the entire world

06:18.029 --> 06:19.814
has its own resonant frequency,
even cells.

06:19.857 --> 06:21.642
No, I get that you want to help.

06:21.685 --> 06:23.121
It's just there's nothing
to help with right now, okay?

06:23.165 --> 06:25.210
Well,
I could use your help.

06:25.254 --> 06:26.516
Want to ride shotgun?

06:26.560 --> 06:28.431
Great. I'm in.

06:28.475 --> 06:30.041
- Uh, out.
- Uh, no, I'm in.

06:30.085 --> 06:31.695
You made it very clear
that my brain has no place here.

06:31.739 --> 06:33.175
And last time
Maria was lost

06:33.218 --> 06:34.568
in her own mind, I
was able to find her.

06:34.611 --> 06:36.265
So maybe I can actually help.

06:36.308 --> 06:38.398
That is true. Here, hold this.

06:38.441 --> 06:39.964
What is this,

06:40.008 --> 06:42.227
more of your mom's weird,
mystical crystal crap?

06:42.271 --> 06:45.753
Actually, it's, uh, weird,
mystical alien turquoise crap.

06:45.796 --> 06:47.537
It's kind of a long story,
but, basically,

06:47.581 --> 06:49.539
it boosts our abilities,
so hold on tight.

06:57.286 --> 06:58.722
I'm guessing
that's not good.

06:58.766 --> 06:59.723
Her body temperature's
dropped two degrees

06:59.767 --> 07:01.029
in the last ten minutes.

07:01.072 --> 07:02.857
Means we have less time
than we thought.

07:02.900 --> 07:04.119
Liz, how are we gonna know
when this bond is severed?

07:05.468 --> 07:07.035
It's all new territory.

07:08.776 --> 07:10.952
What happens if she dies
while we're inside?

07:10.995 --> 07:13.258
If her brain stops functioning
and you're still attached,

07:13.302 --> 07:15.478
evidence suggests
that you would die, too.

07:16.740 --> 07:18.873
We'd better get going.

07:28.883 --> 07:30.711
Maria.

07:30.754 --> 07:33.148
Come on. Maria.

07:34.192 --> 07:35.498
Oh.

07:35.542 --> 07:38.588
Aw.

07:40.372 --> 07:42.679
I knew if I kept fighting,
you guys would come.

07:51.993 --> 07:53.647
All right,
here's the plan.

07:53.690 --> 07:55.475
You're gonna pick
an obscure memory.

07:55.518 --> 07:57.389
We're gonna hunker down in it
until Liz finds a way to sever

07:57.433 --> 07:59.304
the bond between you and Jones
and springs us out of here.

07:59.348 --> 08:00.523
I don't want to hide. I need
to follow Patricia's footsteps

08:00.567 --> 08:01.524
to Caulfield.

08:01.568 --> 08:02.525
What is a Caulfield?

08:02.569 --> 08:03.657
Try a max security
prison

08:03.700 --> 08:05.310
run by the Manes family

08:05.354 --> 08:07.965
where they tortured and
experimented on innocent aliens.

08:08.009 --> 08:10.185
And if that's not
podcast-creepy enough,

08:10.228 --> 08:11.795
their side project
was experimenting

08:11.839 --> 08:13.057
on people of color.

08:13.101 --> 08:14.885
And the alien chemicals
that they used

08:14.929 --> 08:16.800
on my grandmother caused
the brain degeneration problems

08:16.844 --> 08:19.281
that have now plagued
the DeLuca line.

08:19.324 --> 08:21.065
If Jones is
so powerful,

08:21.109 --> 08:22.632
why does he need you
to get what he wants?

08:22.676 --> 08:24.504
Navigating memories
isn't an exact science.

08:24.547 --> 08:27.245
He'd have to sort through, what,
four generations of thoughts,

08:27.289 --> 08:29.117
all piled up, one
on top of another.

08:29.160 --> 08:31.989
It would be like browsing the
Web without a search engine.

08:32.033 --> 08:34.818
So I'm Google Maps
- for Diet Thanos.
- Which is probably why

08:34.862 --> 08:37.081
he's drawing a straight line
to where he wants to go

08:37.125 --> 08:39.606
from a place he's
already figured out.

08:39.649 --> 08:41.651
- What does he want, exactly?
- A piece

08:41.695 --> 08:43.914
of alien glass
with an equation on it.

08:43.958 --> 08:46.264
- Equation.
- Mm-hmm.

08:46.308 --> 08:47.527
Like for genetics, maybe?

08:47.570 --> 08:49.180
Because Liz has been
circling this...

08:49.224 --> 08:51.879
scientific bond
that Jones wants to cut.

08:51.922 --> 08:54.446
Wait, so if Jones is
convinced that this alien glass

08:54.490 --> 08:56.100
is the key to his salvation,

08:56.144 --> 08:59.190
then maybe it's just what
we need to destroy him.

08:59.234 --> 09:01.192
Forget running a memory maze
with Jones as the Minotaur.

09:01.236 --> 09:03.717
I mean,
riding with Patricia means

09:03.760 --> 09:05.675
experiencing those memories,

09:05.719 --> 09:07.982
watching her get
experimented on.

09:08.025 --> 09:10.637
Discovering who Patricia met on this day

09:10.680 --> 09:13.901
and stopping a murderous psycho
of the present

09:13.944 --> 09:17.818
outweighs any past trauma
I have to relive.

09:21.169 --> 09:22.997
Well, one thing's
for sure.

09:24.651 --> 09:27.088
You're not going
- into hell alone.
- Yeah.

09:28.959 --> 09:31.092
The nanoblades
will now be combined with the...

09:31.135 --> 09:33.007
newly modified alien serum
and infiltrate

09:33.050 --> 09:36.488
the Jones-Maria cell cluster
for a, uh,

09:36.532 --> 09:39.622
cellular separation test.

09:39.666 --> 09:40.971
If successful,

09:41.015 --> 09:42.712
I will advance
to treating the patient.

09:44.279 --> 09:45.410
And if not,

09:45.454 --> 09:48.065
the three women I love die.

09:50.111 --> 09:52.374
Come on, come on.
Do something.

09:52.417 --> 09:53.680
Move.

10:04.038 --> 10:06.997
Now I just need to synthesize
a safe amount for a microdose

10:07.041 --> 10:10.087
and inject it into Maria's IV.

10:10.131 --> 10:12.655
Well, if they were
going for dystopian hellhole,

10:12.699 --> 10:13.743
they really nailed it.

10:13.787 --> 10:15.049
Someone's coming.

10:17.791 --> 10:19.227
Oh, no,
you don't have to do that.

10:19.270 --> 10:21.316
It's, uh-- This is a rerun.
It's not live TV.

10:21.359 --> 10:22.752
It's like, uh...

10:22.796 --> 10:24.275
It's like <i>A Christmas Carol.</i>

10:24.319 --> 10:25.799
Okay, do you really
think sophomore-year me

10:25.842 --> 10:27.017
read that book?

10:27.061 --> 10:28.715
Think Dumbledore's Pensieve.

10:28.758 --> 10:30.760
Okay, so we're just
observers of the memory.

10:30.804 --> 10:32.544
Other people
- can't see us.
- Mm-hmm.

10:32.588 --> 10:34.416
Right. Well...

10:34.459 --> 10:36.287
Now that we've got the <i>Potter
rules of the mindscape,</i>

10:36.331 --> 10:37.419
what do we do?

10:37.462 --> 10:39.639
We keep walking Patricia's path.

10:39.682 --> 10:40.944
Find the alien she met this day.

10:40.988 --> 10:42.685
And stay alert.

10:42.729 --> 10:45.296
'Cause if we're observers here,
then Jones can be, too.

10:45.340 --> 10:48.604
Are those the people of color
you were talking about?

10:48.648 --> 10:50.258
Yep, and they have no idea

10:50.301 --> 10:52.173
they're walking
to their own demise.

10:53.696 --> 10:54.784
Hey.

10:54.828 --> 10:56.090
If I was looking
for aliens,

10:56.133 --> 10:57.831
I'd think
restricted area.

10:58.788 --> 11:01.138
Will you be joining us today,
Patricia?

11:02.139 --> 11:04.664
Remember, in the mindscape,
you appear as Patricia.

11:04.707 --> 11:06.927
He probably recognizes
you from that...

11:06.970 --> 11:09.320
- phenomenal vintage getup.
- Oh.

11:09.364 --> 11:10.495
I'll see you inside.

11:10.539 --> 11:11.975
Okay,

11:12.019 --> 11:14.674
I say we skip the torture
of the underprivileged.

11:14.717 --> 11:16.501
- What do you think?
- Agreed.

11:16.545 --> 11:18.242
Let's try
this way.

11:27.861 --> 11:30.037
Will you be joining us today,
Patricia?

11:30.080 --> 11:31.995
This again?
What is this, <i>Jumanji?</i>

11:32.039 --> 11:33.431
I'll see you inside.

11:34.955 --> 11:36.826
This is how memory works.

11:36.870 --> 11:38.741
If we want to learn
what Patricia did,

11:38.785 --> 11:40.003
we have to follow
in her footsteps,

11:40.047 --> 11:41.396
experience the day like she did.

11:41.439 --> 11:43.224
If Patricia can do it...

11:44.225 --> 11:45.617
...so can I.

11:45.661 --> 11:47.794
Here goes nothing.

11:54.757 --> 11:56.716
No. No, no, no. No, no, no.

11:56.759 --> 11:58.108
God.

11:58.152 --> 12:01.372
The cells
are fusing back together

12:01.416 --> 12:03.070
and they're multiplying.

12:03.853 --> 12:05.115
If the patient's temperature
drops any lower,

12:05.159 --> 12:07.639
it'll lead
to brain damage and...

12:07.683 --> 12:10.207
eventual cardiac arrest.

12:10.251 --> 12:12.296
Please tell me you remembered
to put fresh batteries

12:12.340 --> 12:14.124
in the tracker you
put on Max's Jeep.

12:14.168 --> 12:16.083
Uh-huh. Jones must have found
and fried the tracker

12:16.126 --> 12:17.780
I placed on his car.

12:18.781 --> 12:19.913
Last point
before it clicked off

12:19.956 --> 12:21.218
was just after
he headed in.

12:21.262 --> 12:22.872
I'm tracking the
camera system

12:22.916 --> 12:25.222
that tracks wildlife,
weather and tourist stops

12:25.266 --> 12:27.964
while writing a program
to capture Max's plate

12:28.008 --> 12:30.314
to narrow down our hunt
for Jones.

12:30.358 --> 12:32.839
All right, based
on this footage,

12:32.882 --> 12:35.493
I'm gonna say that he is
either in the old barn

12:35.537 --> 12:37.408
or the fish warehouse.

12:37.452 --> 12:39.410
So, which is it?

12:39.454 --> 12:41.499
Heads or fish tails?

12:45.808 --> 12:47.418
Hey, Miss Patricia.

12:47.462 --> 12:49.681
I thought
I'd bring my wife this time.

12:50.465 --> 12:53.511
Oh, Freddie's been coughing
real bad for months.

12:53.555 --> 12:55.862
Wasn't until Doc came
to our church,

12:55.905 --> 12:57.298
told us
the coughing's

12:57.341 --> 12:59.169
due to the bad blood,
that we signed up.

12:59.213 --> 13:00.649
Okay, I'm
not a doctor,

13:00.692 --> 13:02.782
but "bad blood"?
That can't be a thing, right?

13:02.825 --> 13:04.871
Best part is,
it's free.

13:04.914 --> 13:05.915
Patricia,

13:05.959 --> 13:07.482
what are you
doing?

13:07.525 --> 13:08.962
Get over here.

13:15.185 --> 13:17.448
What are you waiting for?

13:17.492 --> 13:19.320
You can administer
the first shot to Freddie.

13:20.974 --> 13:23.106
Oh, my God.

13:23.150 --> 13:24.673
This can't be true.

13:24.716 --> 13:28.111
Patricia wasn't the victim
of these experiments.

13:28.155 --> 13:30.897
She was a facilitator of them.

13:34.117 --> 13:36.685
She doesn't have to do this.

13:36.728 --> 13:39.949
Yeah. She does.

13:39.993 --> 13:42.343
If we want to find out
what happens next.

13:45.650 --> 13:47.957
Oh, God.

13:56.400 --> 13:58.838
Got to find a way to
raise Maria's temperature.

14:08.935 --> 14:10.414
Okay. <i>Perdón, amigo.</i>

14:10.458 --> 14:13.330
I got to commandeer your kicks.

14:30.652 --> 14:32.872
Okay.

14:32.915 --> 14:35.831
Stabilized your vitals.

14:35.875 --> 14:39.052
Now I just got to figure
out a way to save your life.

14:45.667 --> 14:46.711
Hey.

14:46.755 --> 14:47.843
Oh, geez.

14:47.887 --> 14:49.192
I thought you were Jones.

14:49.236 --> 14:50.890
Do you think he's close?

14:50.933 --> 14:52.630
Yeah.

14:52.674 --> 14:54.589
I can
feel him.

14:54.632 --> 14:56.243
You know, as someone
who has gone...

14:56.286 --> 14:57.766
<i>Queen's Gambit</i> with this guy,

14:57.809 --> 14:59.028
I can't help but feel
like there's something

14:59.072 --> 15:00.595
we are missing here.

15:00.638 --> 15:02.379
Why he wants that glass.

15:03.163 --> 15:04.468
I don't know.

15:04.512 --> 15:06.253
There are monsters
in every shadow

15:06.296 --> 15:08.168
waiting to prey on the weak.

15:08.211 --> 15:09.517
It's beyond atrocious

15:09.560 --> 15:11.519
that Caulfield existed
in the first place.

15:11.562 --> 15:14.000
But I've got to believe
that monsters can be killed.

15:15.001 --> 15:16.219
Yeah.

15:16.263 --> 15:17.699
Sometimes they win.

15:17.742 --> 15:19.788
I mean, what Maria
is doing in there

15:19.831 --> 15:22.269
is... so brave.

15:23.052 --> 15:25.402
What is the line between
brave and reckless?

15:25.446 --> 15:27.230
Maybe it would be better
if we were hiding.

15:27.274 --> 15:29.232
Except that everything
you hide from

15:29.276 --> 15:30.930
catches up to you eventually.

15:30.973 --> 15:32.975
I mean, look,
if Maria wanted to run,

15:33.019 --> 15:34.977
of course I would understand.

15:35.021 --> 15:36.892
But...

15:36.936 --> 15:39.373
I'm so glad she chose to fight.

15:40.896 --> 15:42.506
You know, I didn't know that

15:42.550 --> 15:45.248
that ten-year pod soak
came with a Yoda setting.

15:46.641 --> 15:49.774
It's my N.A. theories.
They help, but...

15:49.818 --> 15:52.952
still, I have what Father Linus
calls situational strength.

15:52.995 --> 15:54.388
What's that?

15:54.431 --> 15:56.956
It means that I'm strong
depending on who

15:56.999 --> 15:58.261
or what I'm facing.

15:58.305 --> 16:00.481
Like this morning with Liz,
I just...

16:00.524 --> 16:02.048
reverted right back
to old patterns,

16:02.091 --> 16:03.484
telling myself
that she's the sure-footed one

16:03.527 --> 16:05.573
- and I'm the screwup.
- Yeah.

16:05.616 --> 16:07.618
Well, our dragons
tend to be personal.

16:07.662 --> 16:10.665
That's what makes
them our dragons.

16:10.708 --> 16:13.233
In N.A., they say
that we tend to make them bigger

16:13.276 --> 16:14.756
than they are. But...

16:14.799 --> 16:17.498
I don't know. I just want Liz
to see me as an equal.

16:17.541 --> 16:18.716
You know, Rosa,

16:18.760 --> 16:21.806
I don't think that's
your hurdle to get over.

16:21.850 --> 16:23.852
I think the same
is true for you.

16:27.203 --> 16:29.771
Don't let Jones carve your path.

16:30.728 --> 16:32.121
I mean...

16:32.165 --> 16:35.168
this mindscape stuff,
it's always been your jam.

16:37.474 --> 16:38.998
Oh.

16:39.041 --> 16:40.738
- Come on.
- Come on.

16:43.306 --> 16:44.699
Oh, and thank you for prepping
all those vials, Patricia.

16:44.742 --> 16:46.135
We treated a record
number of volunteers

16:46.179 --> 16:47.745
this week
thanks to your commitment

16:47.789 --> 16:48.920
to the project.

16:55.101 --> 16:56.885
Everything I thought
I knew about Patricia

16:56.928 --> 16:58.887
was a lie.

16:58.930 --> 17:01.063
I thought
we were good people,

17:01.107 --> 17:02.804
and now I don't know who we are.

17:02.847 --> 17:04.240
Who I am.

17:05.372 --> 17:09.071
Listen, it's not too
late to turn back.

17:09.115 --> 17:10.899
There's no
- shame in that.
- Look,

17:10.942 --> 17:13.423
I think we have
to see this through. I do.

17:13.467 --> 17:16.557
I literally wouldn't be here
if some people hadn't turned

17:16.600 --> 17:18.124
the page, so... You're right.

17:18.167 --> 17:20.387
This is bigger than me
or Patricia.

17:22.606 --> 17:24.260
Patricia, it's time.

17:24.304 --> 17:26.349
I got you ten minutes with the
prisoner, just like we planned.

17:26.393 --> 17:28.438
Room B, sublevel 2.
But be quick.

17:28.482 --> 17:30.049
Doc finds you,
you're on your own.

17:30.092 --> 17:31.311
Thank you.

17:31.354 --> 17:33.008
You can thank me
with ten silver crosses,

17:33.052 --> 17:34.183
just like we planned.

17:35.750 --> 17:37.360
Maybe this is it.

17:37.404 --> 17:40.059
This is the person that Patricia
was supposed to meet today.

17:40.102 --> 17:41.886
So we're doing this?

17:41.930 --> 17:44.063
We're doing it.

17:56.597 --> 17:59.991
I've tried every chemical combo
I can think of,

18:00.035 --> 18:01.906
and nothing is working.

18:01.950 --> 18:04.605
The infection is spreading,
and we have so little time!

18:04.648 --> 18:07.521
It's...

18:15.224 --> 18:18.836
When I left last year, you asked
me if I was leaving or running.

18:18.880 --> 18:21.056
And I told you the first,
because I was too afraid

18:21.100 --> 18:22.405
to admit the second.

18:25.191 --> 18:26.975
I've been
listening to Kyle.

18:27.018 --> 18:30.848
But I realized, like, I don't...

18:30.892 --> 18:32.937
just run from things.

18:32.981 --> 18:35.549
I run <i>to</i> them,

18:35.592 --> 18:37.203
like...

18:37.246 --> 18:41.120
the sheer velocity of my running
can will something into being.

18:41.163 --> 18:45.341
And it works enough of the time
to let me keep lying to myself.

18:48.562 --> 18:50.520
And now everyone I love
is gonna die

18:50.564 --> 18:53.132
because I lie to myself
that being the smartest person

18:53.175 --> 18:55.308
in the room can be enough.

19:03.577 --> 19:06.449
Sorry. Sorry.

19:07.233 --> 19:09.583
Probably did not feel good
on the ears.

19:11.237 --> 19:14.979
Sound moved... you.

19:15.023 --> 19:16.285
Sounds move things.

19:16.329 --> 19:18.287
Sounds...

19:18.331 --> 19:20.202
are vibrations.

19:27.383 --> 19:29.820
Sound is making
Jones' cells vibrate.

19:29.864 --> 19:32.214
Damn, Rosa.

19:32.258 --> 19:34.651
You were onto something.

19:46.228 --> 19:47.186
It's Nora.

19:47.229 --> 19:49.100
Michael's mom?

19:49.144 --> 19:52.582
- Still can't get over how much
I see Louise in your eyes.

19:52.626 --> 19:55.194
Did the doctors have you tied up
doing their work for them again?

19:55.237 --> 19:57.108
Y-You could say that. Yeah.

19:57.152 --> 20:00.460
I know you want to save
as many as you can,

20:00.503 --> 20:03.158
but if you keep swapping out
test serum with placebos,

20:03.202 --> 20:04.420
they will find out
and catch you.

20:04.464 --> 20:06.117
I knew your grandma
was Team Badass.

20:06.161 --> 20:09.208
I understand. My kind are
being experimented on, too.

20:09.251 --> 20:11.210
But thanks to you,
I'm one step closer.

20:11.253 --> 20:14.213
You followed the schematics
exactly to make the machine?

20:14.256 --> 20:16.650
Good. As soon as the
final piece is in,

20:16.693 --> 20:18.695
I need you to smuggle
the machine back out.

20:18.739 --> 20:20.436
I'm ready
for the final piece.

20:20.480 --> 20:23.047
If only it were mine to give.

20:23.091 --> 20:24.788
One of my kind, Theo,

20:24.832 --> 20:27.008
he has critical information
for the device.

20:27.051 --> 20:30.707
Theo was the scientist that
Jones forced to make clones.

20:30.751 --> 20:33.232
He's the third member
of my triad.

20:33.275 --> 20:36.887
Together, we stole Jones'
genetics to make a clone.

20:36.931 --> 20:39.499
He's the only one left
to continue his reign.

20:39.542 --> 20:41.675
Which caused a
problem with the boy

20:41.718 --> 20:43.372
that still needs to be mended.

20:43.416 --> 20:47.420
You mean genetically.
What was the problem with Max?

20:48.203 --> 20:49.422
The-the child?

20:52.381 --> 20:53.904
They must not
have discussed it.

20:53.948 --> 20:55.558
Great. More <i>Jumanji.</i>

20:55.602 --> 20:57.168
The science
to fix this,

20:57.212 --> 21:00.041
to end this fight,
to save our home

21:00.084 --> 21:01.564
is in Theo's mind.

21:01.608 --> 21:03.305
You must find him.

21:03.349 --> 21:05.220
Give him the Oasian glass.

21:05.264 --> 21:06.613
What Oasian glass?

21:07.440 --> 21:10.573
The men here hurt me
until I made some. It's blank.

21:10.617 --> 21:12.096
But when Theo's
done with it,

21:12.140 --> 21:13.402
it'll be the final piece needed

21:13.446 --> 21:14.969
for the machine to be activated

21:15.012 --> 21:16.449
to make contact.

21:16.492 --> 21:19.365
Y-You mean contact with
the other Oasians, like a...

21:19.408 --> 21:20.366
telephone?

21:20.409 --> 21:22.629
In a way, but also...

21:22.672 --> 21:24.935
so much more.

21:24.979 --> 21:29.026
Just because we have
Jones contained for now

21:29.070 --> 21:30.593
doesn't erase the threat.

21:31.812 --> 21:34.380
This information can never
make it into his hands.

21:34.423 --> 21:35.990
I won't let you down.

21:39.907 --> 21:41.561
Plan's solid.

21:41.604 --> 21:43.084
But let's say

21:43.127 --> 21:44.433
an unforeseen opportunity
presented itself.

21:44.477 --> 21:45.434
Stay the course.

21:45.478 --> 21:46.566
If things go sideways,

21:46.609 --> 21:47.958
we leave empty-handed,
but...

21:48.002 --> 21:50.352
at least we'll have
- our lives.
- Yeah.

21:50.396 --> 21:52.311
Just a suggestion
for an alt, though...

21:52.354 --> 21:54.443
No. This is
where you need

21:54.487 --> 21:55.792
to stay on mission.

21:55.836 --> 21:57.794
The pod is
the number one priority.

21:57.838 --> 21:59.448
Okay.

21:59.492 --> 22:01.668
Whatever else you're thinking
right now, just forget about it.

22:03.191 --> 22:05.933
It's your choices in the moment
of truth that matter.

22:05.976 --> 22:07.369
Sorry.

22:07.413 --> 22:10.677
I don't mean to step on
your... MacArthur moment,

22:10.720 --> 22:13.636
but even he knew the value
of a contingency plan.

22:13.680 --> 22:15.116
That's all
I'm trying... Hey.

22:25.431 --> 22:27.041
In Iraq,

22:27.084 --> 22:29.391
there was this...

22:29.435 --> 22:31.872
little boy named Omar.

22:31.915 --> 22:35.876
We would trade eggs
for chocolate bars.

22:35.919 --> 22:37.486
And he, uh...

22:37.530 --> 22:40.228
he would act out scenes
from any James Bond movie.

22:42.361 --> 22:44.406
He was this piece of...

22:44.450 --> 22:48.018
normalcy for me
in the maelstrom.

22:48.062 --> 22:49.759
This one day,

22:49.803 --> 22:52.327
I was gonna surprise him
with a stack of chocolates

22:52.371 --> 22:54.721
and some black market Bond DVDs.

22:59.465 --> 23:02.424
Then I saw his body
on the corner.

23:04.121 --> 23:06.602
The corner
where we would always talk.

23:09.866 --> 23:13.261
The only crime he ever committed
was being my friend.

23:14.088 --> 23:16.220
So when a mission
came up to, uh...

23:16.264 --> 23:18.614
to take out the Taliban captain
who was responsible,

23:18.658 --> 23:20.703
my buddy and I jumped on it.

23:25.621 --> 23:27.101
I killed him.

23:32.498 --> 23:33.673
But, in the moment
of truth,

23:33.716 --> 23:35.675
I deemed
that that wasn't enough.

23:35.718 --> 23:37.067
My buddy wanted
to fall back.

23:37.111 --> 23:39.418
I convinced him to...

23:39.461 --> 23:41.942
push further
into their lair.

23:42.725 --> 23:44.379
We did not stay
on mission.

23:44.423 --> 23:45.859
We got completely overwhelmed.

23:45.902 --> 23:49.428
And I caught a-a bullet
where my leg used to be.

23:49.471 --> 23:51.299
Next day I found out
that the SEALs

23:51.342 --> 23:53.780
had a plan
to go wipe them all out.

23:53.823 --> 23:56.652
But, because of me,
they had scattered away.

23:56.696 --> 24:01.091
I let my emotions
cloud my judgment.

24:05.226 --> 24:08.534
I lost a piece of me,
in many ways, on that mission.

24:10.710 --> 24:14.801
You're-- You are the one piece

24:14.844 --> 24:17.151
that I cannot go through life
without.

24:26.508 --> 24:28.249
Treatment objective is
to generate

24:28.292 --> 24:30.686
the right sound frequency
to separate Jones' cells

24:30.730 --> 24:32.340
from Maria.

24:32.383 --> 24:34.908
The parameters of the
desired frequency are narrow.

24:34.951 --> 24:36.779
If the frequency
is too high or too low,

24:36.823 --> 24:39.478
it could rupture
and kill both cells,

24:39.521 --> 24:40.957
causing a chain reaction,

24:41.001 --> 24:43.264
killing Maria
and everybody inside her mind.

24:43.307 --> 24:45.005
Okay.

24:45.048 --> 24:47.790
This is why
I am conducting a test

24:47.834 --> 24:51.490
using cells I scraped from
the handprint on Maria's head

24:51.533 --> 24:53.056
left by Jones.

24:54.188 --> 24:56.016
Okay.

25:07.070 --> 25:08.855
It's working.

25:13.642 --> 25:15.122
Rosa? Hey, you okay?

25:15.165 --> 25:16.993
What-what do you hear?

25:17.037 --> 25:18.604
If you guys can't hear it, there
must be something happening

25:18.647 --> 25:20.823
with the frequency outside
of Maria's body.

25:20.867 --> 25:22.042
My gosh,

25:22.085 --> 25:23.478
I bet Liz is doing something
to try to help.

25:23.522 --> 25:25.524
- Oh. I got to go help her.
- No, Rosa,

25:25.567 --> 25:27.047
- we need you here.
- No, you don't.

25:27.090 --> 25:29.440
This is your mind palace, Iz.
Remember that.

25:30.616 --> 25:31.573
I'll see you on the outside.

25:37.013 --> 25:38.580
Hey. Hey,
hey, hey, hey.

25:38.624 --> 25:40.669
What happened?
Are you okay?

25:45.544 --> 25:47.807
Well...

25:47.850 --> 25:51.550
here's to no more twists
on our way to meet Theo.

26:01.951 --> 26:04.867
Oh, my God.
Theo's dead.

26:04.911 --> 26:08.262
Uh, you were saying about
there being no more twists?

26:15.878 --> 26:17.488
- Did you call me?
- No, but I am

26:17.532 --> 26:18.577
so glad you're here.

26:18.620 --> 26:19.839
Okay, the ultrasound machine

26:19.882 --> 26:21.362
that you were hearing--

26:21.405 --> 26:23.625
your line of thinking
earlier, it was right.

26:24.887 --> 26:26.236
I'm sorry that I...

26:26.280 --> 26:27.890
shut you down.

26:27.934 --> 26:31.590
It's... alien water
under the alien bridge.

26:32.895 --> 26:35.115
Need a lab assistant?

26:35.985 --> 26:39.249
Actually, I need you
to be my lab <i>equipment.</i>

26:45.691 --> 26:47.823
It's a line of questions.

26:49.520 --> 26:50.783
Theo was being tortured,

26:50.826 --> 26:53.089
and he didn't talk.

26:53.786 --> 26:55.570
Well, with his stoic silence,

26:55.614 --> 26:58.529
he didn't exactly tell us what
to do with this glass, either.

26:58.573 --> 27:00.836
All right, let me see this.

27:01.968 --> 27:04.448
There's no swirling symbols
on it.

27:04.492 --> 27:06.625
Usually, when I touch
the glass that Michael has,

27:06.668 --> 27:07.756
it-it lights up.

27:07.800 --> 27:09.802
It starts
to shimmer and move.

27:09.845 --> 27:11.281
So you're saying this one is...

27:11.325 --> 27:12.892
- empty?
- I don't know.

27:12.935 --> 27:15.459
Michael always says
that alien glass is part tech

27:15.503 --> 27:17.070
and part genetics.

27:19.942 --> 27:21.770
Do you remember
at the county fair last year,

27:21.814 --> 27:24.599
when Max touched
that console, he-he got

27:24.643 --> 27:26.645
information about Jones.

27:26.688 --> 27:28.255
Theo has a symbol on his head.

27:28.298 --> 27:30.779
It looks like the one
that was on Michael's glass.

27:30.823 --> 27:32.781
What if this interacts

27:32.825 --> 27:34.478
because it holds information,
like a thumb drive?

27:34.522 --> 27:38.831
So if the ideas in his head
made it onto the glass,

27:38.874 --> 27:40.267
maybe... Yeah.

27:54.847 --> 27:58.677
♪ I don't want
to set the world ♪

27:58.720 --> 28:04.030
♪ On fire...

28:04.857 --> 28:06.685
Okay. You were right

28:06.728 --> 28:09.209
about vibrations and resonant
frequency being the answer.

28:09.252 --> 28:11.602
- No way. Shut up.
- Okay. So,
because of what you said,

28:11.646 --> 28:13.082
I thought about this study
that I read

28:13.126 --> 28:15.737
where sound waves
were used on tumors.

28:15.781 --> 28:17.260
Then I found
this research explaining

28:17.304 --> 28:19.306
how sound frequency
can break plaque bonds

28:19.349 --> 28:20.394
in Alzheimer's patients.

28:20.437 --> 28:22.265
Impressive.
But in terms of Maria...

28:22.309 --> 28:25.965
I have MacGyver'd an ultrasound
machine to be more powerful.

28:26.008 --> 28:27.314
But I'm not able
to measure frequency.

28:27.357 --> 28:28.968
It's sort of like
souping up a hot rod

28:29.011 --> 28:30.447
and then driving it
without a speedometer.

28:30.491 --> 28:31.927
So you need my subatomic
vibrational frequency

28:31.971 --> 28:33.407
- to be your speedometer?
- Yes.

28:33.450 --> 28:34.669
I need you

28:34.713 --> 28:35.844
to listen
to the resonant frequency

28:35.888 --> 28:37.716
of the alien cells in Jones' DNA

28:37.759 --> 28:39.195
and tell me when they match

28:39.239 --> 28:41.023
with the ultrasound
- machine.
- And then what?

28:41.067 --> 28:42.851
I could chalkboard out
the science, but, essentially,

28:42.895 --> 28:44.026
we're gonna try
to break Jones' cells

28:44.070 --> 28:45.767
like an opera singer does
a glass.

28:45.811 --> 28:48.030
Without accidentally shattering
- Maria's cells.
- Right.

28:48.074 --> 28:49.858
Who says science isn't exciting?

29:26.025 --> 29:27.766
I think it's finished.

29:27.809 --> 29:29.463
- It is.

29:31.204 --> 29:33.772
I knew I felt you lurking
in the shadows.

29:33.815 --> 29:35.295
Why wait
to pounce?

29:35.338 --> 29:37.558
You could've taken the glass
when Nora gave it to me.

29:37.601 --> 29:39.603
No. He couldn't.

29:39.647 --> 29:42.650
He's just as bound up in
Patricia's memories as we are.

29:42.693 --> 29:44.478
In order to find
what he wanted,

29:44.521 --> 29:47.176
he had to let you walk
in her footsteps.

29:47.960 --> 29:50.092
You needed my eyes to see.

29:50.136 --> 29:51.702
Well, I knew you couldn't resist
the urge to walk the path

29:51.746 --> 29:52.834
of your grandmother.

29:52.878 --> 29:54.096
Her senseof honor

29:54.140 --> 29:56.795
would be your siren song.

29:56.838 --> 29:59.623
All I had to do was tell you
how important that was to me

29:59.667 --> 30:02.365
and let your ill-fated
good nature do the rest.

30:02.409 --> 30:03.758
Besides,

30:03.802 --> 30:05.586
why fight

30:05.629 --> 30:08.154
when I can just stroll
up and see all this?

30:08.197 --> 30:10.939
Why is this science
so important to you?

30:10.983 --> 30:13.028
What does it have to do
with Max?

30:13.072 --> 30:14.900
Back on our home world,

30:14.943 --> 30:16.510
there were a lot of Maxes.

30:16.553 --> 30:19.643
The model you have
shouldn't even exist.

30:19.687 --> 30:21.863
Which makes him
all the more a miracle.

30:21.907 --> 30:23.517
Unlike the others,

30:23.560 --> 30:26.172
he's more than just a vessel
for me.

30:27.173 --> 30:28.000
It is...

30:29.915 --> 30:32.656
It's a little tight,

30:32.700 --> 30:34.093
but, uh...

30:34.136 --> 30:35.834
they definitely saved
the best for last.

30:35.877 --> 30:39.315
You said
the Dictator was immortal.

30:39.359 --> 30:43.232
You've been jumping into
clones' bodies to stay alive.

30:43.276 --> 30:47.149
Until your mother's triad
slaughtered all of them

30:47.193 --> 30:50.805
and destroyed the science
I needed to generate more.

30:50.849 --> 30:52.198
But...

30:52.241 --> 30:55.288
soon, such hurdles
will all be a moot point.

31:09.519 --> 31:11.870
- Keep the
glass, Maria.

31:11.913 --> 31:14.046
I got Jones.

31:18.311 --> 31:21.357
Want to play mind games?
Let's go!

31:36.155 --> 31:37.547
Time to get back
to that equation.

31:37.591 --> 31:38.766
I don't think so.

31:42.509 --> 31:44.815
What happened?
Is it not strong enough?

31:44.859 --> 31:46.252
I tried to make it more... No. It's on steroids.

31:46.295 --> 31:47.775
Are you kidding? You crushed it.

31:47.818 --> 31:50.560
I'd say it's maybe
an octave and a half off.

31:50.604 --> 31:52.345
Lower.

32:06.446 --> 32:09.144
It's hard for me to be able to
keep up to, process and gauge it

32:09.188 --> 32:10.972
at the same time.
I wish we had...

32:11.016 --> 32:12.756
Isobel's turquoise.

32:12.800 --> 32:15.150
She uses it to boost her powers.
We can use it now to...

32:15.194 --> 32:16.891
- Amplify your super hearing.
- Yes.

32:16.935 --> 32:18.806
It'll make you more precise.
Here. Okay.

32:18.849 --> 32:21.548
Push it closer slowly, and
I'll tell you when to stop.

32:22.288 --> 32:23.680
Patricia. I found out

32:23.724 --> 32:25.944
you've been swapping
the experimental drug

32:25.987 --> 32:27.032
for placebos!

32:29.817 --> 32:31.253
We know

32:31.297 --> 32:32.515
about what
you've been doing

32:32.559 --> 32:33.995
with Nora and the
machine as well.

32:34.039 --> 32:35.431
You are gonna pay

32:35.475 --> 32:36.955
for the damage
you've done.

33:02.110 --> 33:03.851
I'm gonna fix you up

33:03.894 --> 33:06.375
with a nice,
potent double dose.

33:06.419 --> 33:08.029
We'll observe you closely

33:08.073 --> 33:10.205
and see what data in the name
of science we can gain,

33:10.249 --> 33:13.643
considering how much data
you cost us.

33:15.384 --> 33:16.733
You have a lot to learn.

33:16.777 --> 33:18.735
Where are you going?!

33:34.055 --> 33:36.231
You can't...

33:36.275 --> 33:38.581
stop their plan,

33:38.625 --> 33:39.930
Dr. Lockhart.

33:39.974 --> 33:43.064
Well, the truth is, Patricia,

33:43.108 --> 33:44.718
I already have.

33:49.723 --> 33:50.854
Slow and steady, sis.

33:51.377 --> 33:53.683
So this is what
you've been hiding from me

33:53.727 --> 33:54.989
all these months.

33:55.033 --> 33:57.992
Do you really think
this can stop me?

34:00.168 --> 34:01.343
Oh.

34:01.387 --> 34:03.954
Stopping you was
never the plan.

34:03.998 --> 34:05.608
What happens if I turn it on?

34:08.568 --> 34:11.484
So, then the battle
was for...

34:11.527 --> 34:12.485
Time.

34:12.528 --> 34:15.096
Which, by the
looks of things,

34:15.140 --> 34:16.576
you're out of.

34:41.775 --> 34:43.559
- Whew! Kept to the plan!
- All right, let's celebrate

34:43.603 --> 34:44.604
at the bottom
- of the mountain, Guerin.
- Oh, yeah.

34:46.040 --> 34:47.607
Come on.

34:52.438 --> 34:53.569
Okay, I'm open
to that contingency plan.

34:53.613 --> 34:56.094
Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Good, good.

34:57.834 --> 34:59.575
Let us go!

34:59.619 --> 35:02.274
Might as well shoot Max in that
pod if you want to hurt me.

35:02.317 --> 35:04.232
What are you talking about?

35:04.276 --> 35:07.105
When I healed Max's body,

35:07.148 --> 35:08.932
we traded places.

35:08.976 --> 35:12.371
So now Max is in my body,

35:12.414 --> 35:14.286
and I'm in his.

35:14.329 --> 35:16.288
Though it's all the same,
really.

35:17.680 --> 35:19.595
Our cells
are psychically linked.

35:19.639 --> 35:21.075
You have your mother to thank

35:21.119 --> 35:22.816
- for that, actually.
- You're lying!

35:22.859 --> 35:24.209
Am I?

35:24.252 --> 35:26.472
Do you have the
strength to find out?

35:30.606 --> 35:32.826
Just put the gun down.

35:32.869 --> 35:35.611
Hear the whole story
from your father's mouth.

35:39.093 --> 35:41.182
Get in! Let's go!

35:41.226 --> 35:42.314
Go, go, go,
go, go!

35:49.277 --> 35:51.453
<i>We needed this win,</i>

35:51.497 --> 35:53.716
<i>hermana.
Yes, we did.</i>

35:53.760 --> 35:57.720
And I needed a lesson that you
were kind enough to teach me.

35:59.548 --> 36:02.203
I've seen how much you've
grown in your recovery.

36:02.247 --> 36:04.945
I let my ego and
narrow-mindedness get in the way

36:04.988 --> 36:06.642
of considering
all options.

36:06.686 --> 36:10.080
And the only reason that Maria
is alive is because of you.

36:10.124 --> 36:12.170
Hmm.

36:13.867 --> 36:17.262
You know, I think
we make a pretty good team.

36:17.305 --> 36:19.525
And as I learn
about...

36:19.568 --> 36:22.615
myself and all this...

36:22.658 --> 36:24.747
I'm really gonna need you.

36:26.096 --> 36:29.099
I've actually had some dreams
percolating lately.

36:29.143 --> 36:30.536
But...

36:30.579 --> 36:32.625
I think, for now,
we should just hug it out

36:32.668 --> 36:34.409
and go celebrate with Maria.

36:35.628 --> 36:38.500
We doing shots or what, guys?

36:38.544 --> 36:41.242
Heck yes! Hey.

36:41.286 --> 36:43.288
Hey. Mmm.

36:43.331 --> 36:44.550
- Mmm, mmm.
- I'm on the slow train today,

36:44.593 --> 36:46.378

36:46.421 --> 36:48.467

DeLuca.

36:48.510 --> 36:50.382

- Hey.

that you were fighting in there.

36:55.735 --> 36:58.346
Mm. Thankfully, I was
not fighting alone.

36:58.390 --> 36:59.695
I had my sisters with me.

37:00.914 --> 37:02.220
And Patricia.

37:02.263 --> 37:04.700
And your mom, Guerin.

37:04.744 --> 37:06.485
I didn't get a lot
of time with her,

37:06.528 --> 37:08.791
but, from what I saw,
she was a genius.

37:08.835 --> 37:10.010

37:11.490 --> 37:13.883
Patricia and Nora were
working on a machine together,

37:13.927 --> 37:17.496

creepy doctor named Lockhart.
