01:09.978 --> 01:12.564
<i>Everybody up!
Zarkon's attacking!</i>

01:18.486 --> 01:20.405
<i>The Castle's
about to be destroyed!</i>

01:22.032 --> 01:25.368
<i>Go, go, go!
We need Voltron now!</i>

01:26.578 --> 01:28.788
Hurry!
We can't survive much longer!

01:29.247 --> 01:32.208
You've got to sell it a little
bit more.

01:32.292 --> 01:34.677
Oh, no! Allura is dead!

01:34.678 --> 01:38.256
Aw, it's horrible!
Her head fell off!

01:38.923 --> 01:42.218
Wait! What? Her severed head
is trying to speak to me!

01:42.302 --> 01:45.972
What is it, Allura's head?
What are your final words?

01:46.056 --> 01:48.850
- Coran.
- Oh, yes, Princess, I'm listening.

01:48.933 --> 01:49.976
It's over.

01:50.060 --> 01:55.774
Oh, I know!
If only Voltron had been formed.

01:55.857 --> 02:00.570
- Oh! Time!
- I guess this isn't an actual attack.

02:00.654 --> 02:04.240
And it's a good thing it wasn't
because it took you... Coran?

02:04.324 --> 02:05.992
Seventy-five degrees.

02:06.826 --> 02:09.245
Oh, sorry. No, this
is a meat thermometer.

02:09.329 --> 02:11.790
However long it was, it was too long.

02:11.873 --> 02:14.876
You must always be ready
to do battle with Zarkon.

02:14.959 --> 02:18.129
Look at you! Only Shiro is in uniform.

02:18.213 --> 02:21.174
Keith, Pidge, Hunk,
where are your bayards?

02:21.257 --> 02:22.509
And where is Lance?

02:26.054 --> 02:29.099
Good morning, everybody.
What's going on?

02:29.182 --> 02:32.560
Coran and I have been up for hours
getting the Castle back in order.

02:32.644 --> 02:36.231
We had to run a test on the alarms,
and we decided to test you as well.

02:36.314 --> 02:37.982
Guess which one failed.

02:38.066 --> 02:39.275
Hey!

02:40.443 --> 02:44.739
You got to sleep for 10,000 years,
man. Monday night, I was on Earth.

02:44.823 --> 02:48.451
Now, I've flown through space,
fought some evil alien named Zarkon,

02:48.535 --> 02:50.995
eaten goo in some weird castle.

02:51.079 --> 02:52.664
That's a lot to process in, uh...

02:54.082 --> 02:55.625
I don't know. What day is today?

02:55.708 --> 02:59.003
It's the third quintant of the
Spicolian movement. Hump day!

02:59.087 --> 03:00.713
It's a lot to process.

03:00.797 --> 03:03.341
You must understand the
stakes of our mission.

03:03.425 --> 03:05.343
Over the last 10,000 years,

03:05.427 --> 03:08.471
the Castle picked up distress
beacons from the following locations.

03:09.055 --> 03:11.558
So, we have to assume
that Zarkon has conquered

03:11.641 --> 03:13.226
almost the entire known universe.

03:13.935 --> 03:18.398
Earth is here. An attack on
your planet is inevitable.

03:18.481 --> 03:19.941
Oh, no.

03:20.024 --> 03:21.526
Exactly.

03:21.609 --> 03:24.070
Our mission is to
free all those planets.

03:24.154 --> 03:26.865
Coran and I are getting the
Castle ready to leave Arus.

03:26.948 --> 03:30.660
During that time, you have
to learn to form Voltron,

03:30.743 --> 03:33.163
so we can begin fighting Zarkon.

03:33.246 --> 03:36.875
The Princess is right. Let's get
to our lions and start training.

03:36.958 --> 03:40.128
Wait. But I want to talk to the
prisoners we rescued from the Galra ship.

03:40.211 --> 03:43.131
Negative, Number Five. I have
you ranked by height, okay?

03:43.214 --> 03:46.176
The prisoners need to remain in the
cryo-replenishers until tomorrow.

03:46.259 --> 03:48.845
That's right. Now, get to your lions.

04:09.908 --> 04:14.120
Whoa, whoa, whoa. What's going on?
What's going...?

04:15.538 --> 04:16.873
Aw, come on.

04:18.666 --> 04:20.293
You've got to be kidding me.

04:46.736 --> 04:48.738
Hmm... Mm...

04:51.616 --> 04:53.159
Whoa!

04:56.496 --> 04:58.289
Should someone go in after him?

04:59.415 --> 05:01.209
Hi, guys. Sorry, everybody.

05:01.292 --> 05:02.877
Seriously, though, can't
they park these things,

05:02.961 --> 05:04.462
<i>like, a little closer to the bridge?</i>

05:04.546 --> 05:08.424
All right, guys. Let's just fly in tight
formation until we're totally in sync.

05:08.508 --> 05:11.261
<i>Feel the bond with your
lions and your fellow pilots</i>

05:11.344 --> 05:15.390
<i>until five become one
unit and you form Voltron!</i>

05:15.473 --> 05:16.599
<i>Yeah!</i>

05:20.395 --> 05:21.396
Yeah!

05:23.940 --> 05:24.941
Yeah!

05:28.403 --> 05:29.404
Yay.

05:32.282 --> 05:33.533
Whoo.

05:33.616 --> 05:35.869
Am I the only one who's still
pretending to be excited?

05:37.704 --> 05:41.291
Clearly, this isn't working.
Let's set down for a little bit.

05:41.374 --> 05:44.252
Maybe we should be building
Voltron from the ground up.

05:44.335 --> 05:45.670
What do you mean?

05:45.753 --> 05:48.464
I mean, let's try
literally building Voltron,

05:48.548 --> 05:50.466
like, stacking on top of each other.

05:50.550 --> 05:53.845
- Like a cheerleader pyramid?
- You got a better idea?

05:53.928 --> 05:55.179
It's worth a try.

06:03.146 --> 06:05.857
- Hunk, what are you doing?
- What do you mean?

06:05.940 --> 06:08.109
You're supposed to
be the leg over there.

06:08.192 --> 06:09.861
What? No. No, no, no.

06:09.944 --> 06:12.614
I'm pretty sure that when we did
it last time, I was the head. Right?

06:12.697 --> 06:16.909
- You yelled, "I'm a leg!"
- Yeah, I was yelling a lot of things.

06:16.993 --> 06:19.954
- Shiro's the head.
- All the time?

06:20.038 --> 06:23.958
- Let's just try it my way for now.
- Okay, but next time I call head.

06:26.294 --> 06:30.882
Okay. Arms and legs...
and I'll form the head.

06:34.135 --> 06:36.387
Feel the bonds with your lions.

06:36.471 --> 06:39.432
Now, channel your energy
into forming Voltron.

06:40.850 --> 06:43.227
Focus. Focus.

06:51.486 --> 06:53.863
Is everyone bonding and focusing?

06:53.946 --> 06:56.699
Why was this so much easier before?

06:56.783 --> 06:58.785
Let's take a break.

06:58.868 --> 07:01.621
Sorry to interrupt, but
I may be able to help.

07:01.704 --> 07:03.873
Yesterday, you weren't
able to form Voltron

07:03.956 --> 07:05.625
until you were in the heat of battle.

07:05.708 --> 07:06.751
<i>- Yeah.
- I'm listening.</i>

07:06.834 --> 07:08.127
<i>- You're right.
- Yeah, I guess.</i>

07:08.211 --> 07:09.045
Perfect.

07:09.128 --> 07:12.382
Because I need to run a diagnostic
test on all of the Castle defenses.

07:12.465 --> 07:13.466
This should help!

07:20.306 --> 07:21.891
Okay, go, go!

07:22.600 --> 07:23.935
Allura, what are you doing?

07:24.018 --> 07:28.231
<i>Running a diagnostic test on the
Castle defenses and inspiring you!</i>

07:28.314 --> 07:32.986
<i>I believe in you, Paladins! Let
fear be your guide! Form Voltron!</i>

07:33.820 --> 07:36.239
Forget this!
I'm heading back to the Castle!

07:46.791 --> 07:49.794
Please stop! Please!
Have mercy on us!

07:49.877 --> 07:52.797
<i>You think Zarkon is going
to have mercy on you?</i>

07:52.880 --> 07:55.883
<i>He's probably on his way
right now to destroy us all!</i>

07:56.884 --> 07:59.095
<i>Auto-lock-on engaged.</i>

08:05.935 --> 08:09.147
You have returned early.
Did you complete your mission?

08:09.230 --> 08:11.607
Sir, the moon's crust became unstable.

08:11.691 --> 08:14.485
Staying any longer would
have cost half my crew.

08:14.902 --> 08:20.074
Hmm, perhaps, but the half that
survived would have been stronger.

08:20.158 --> 08:22.744
- Hmm?
- Weakness is an infection.

08:23.453 --> 08:26.748
Better to cut it off than let it spread.

08:27.331 --> 08:29.625
Huh?

08:30.293 --> 08:33.755
What have you and your Druids
come up with to capture Voltron?

08:33.837 --> 08:36.883
I have been working on
perfecting something.

08:36.966 --> 08:38.967
Something that will strike fear

08:39.052 --> 08:42.263
into the hearts of any
that stand against it.

08:42.346 --> 08:45.016
Voltron may have surprised Sendak,

08:45.099 --> 08:48.561
but he will not be able
to overcome my creation.

08:51.564 --> 08:54.358
Are we at full power on
condenser number five yet?

08:54.442 --> 08:56.861
No, still just 84 percent.

08:56.944 --> 08:59.614
You did it! You formed Voltron!

08:59.697 --> 09:03.826
No. The shooting stopped and the particle
barrier shut down, so we just flew in.

09:04.619 --> 09:07.121
- What?
- Oh, right. Sorry, Princess.

09:07.205 --> 09:10.958
I had to turn off the Castle
defenses to test the fire suppressors.

09:11.042 --> 09:14.045
What are you guys doing in here?
We're not taking a break.

09:14.128 --> 09:16.339
Shiro's right. You should be training.

09:16.422 --> 09:18.841
We've been training. When
are we going back to Earth?

09:18.925 --> 09:21.260
I'm not going back
until I find my family.

09:21.344 --> 09:24.806
Guys, there won't be an Earth if we
don't figure out how to fight Zarkon.

09:24.889 --> 09:26.390
How are we going to fight?

09:26.474 --> 09:28.601
We can't even figure
out how to form Voltron.

09:28.684 --> 09:29.936
Well, I'm not surprised.

09:30.019 --> 09:32.855
You know, the original paladins
fought hundreds of battles together,

09:32.939 --> 09:34.148
side-by-side.

09:34.232 --> 09:37.193
They were like a pack of
yalmors linked at the ears.

09:37.276 --> 09:39.987
Wow. Yeah, that's definitely not us.

09:40.071 --> 09:43.699
During the last attack, your survival
instincts forced you to work as a team,

09:43.783 --> 09:45.201
but that will only get you so far.

09:45.284 --> 09:48.079
You'll have to become a real team
to have any chance of forming Voltron

09:48.162 --> 09:50.331
and then beating Zarkon next time.

09:50.414 --> 09:53.042
You should try working
out on the training deck.

09:53.126 --> 09:54.585
There's a training deck?

10:03.511 --> 10:06.973
I think I have the opportunity
you've been waiting for.

10:07.640 --> 10:11.352
How would you like to get your
revenge against the Champion?

10:18.943 --> 10:22.238
Two, two, one, two.

10:22.321 --> 10:24.240
Okay, listen up, guys.

10:24.323 --> 10:28.828
<i>The paladin code demands you put your
team members' safety above your own.</i>

10:29.453 --> 10:32.081
<i>- A swarm of drones is about to attack.
- Huh?</i>

10:32.165 --> 10:33.958
<i>It's up to each of you
to do everything you can</i>

10:34.041 --> 10:35.793
<i>to protect the other
members of your team.</i>

10:36.627 --> 10:38.588
Wait, wait, wait. What's going on?

10:39.130 --> 10:42.466
Whoa.
Did you guys get one of these?

10:42.550 --> 10:43.634
Get ready.

10:47.513 --> 10:51.184
<i>Protect your teammates or no
one will be there to protect you!</i>

10:52.268 --> 10:54.187
<i>Time to increase intensity.</i>

10:57.315 --> 11:01.027
- You keeping up over there, Keith?
- Just concentrate on keeping me safe.

11:01.110 --> 11:02.528
Me?
I own this drill.

11:02.529 --> 11:04.655
You're the one who needs to concentrate.

11:15.625 --> 11:18.502
<i>To form Voltron,
you must trust in each other.</i>

11:18.586 --> 11:21.505
<i>This ancient paladin maze
will teach you that trust.</i>

11:21.589 --> 11:24.550
<i>Your teammate can see
the walls, but you cannot.</i>

11:24.634 --> 11:28.387
So, listen carefully. If you touch
the walls, you'll get a slight shock.

11:30.473 --> 11:33.476
- Wait. Who's guiding me through?
- Take two steps forward.

11:33.559 --> 11:37.229
Oh, no. Not Keith. Why does he
get to be the man on the mic?

11:37.313 --> 11:39.774
Now, just sit tight.
You'll get your turn.

11:39.857 --> 11:43.027
Like I said, take two
steps forward, turn right,

11:43.110 --> 11:45.655
and take three steps that direction.

11:45.738 --> 11:48.074
You did that on purpose!

11:48.157 --> 11:51.577
- You're not listening.
- You said, "Turn right."

11:51.661 --> 11:54.747
But, before that, I said,
"Take two steps forward."

11:54.830 --> 11:56.749
Two steps...

11:56.832 --> 11:59.418
We're switching places right now!

12:00.795 --> 12:02.630
<i>You'll never
be able to form Voltron</i>

12:02.713 --> 12:06.008
<i>unless each of you has a
strong bond with his lion.</i>

12:06.342 --> 12:10.096
No problem. Me and Blue are
best buds for life, for real.

12:10.596 --> 12:14.058
Perfect! Then you won't have
any issues with this exercise.

12:14.141 --> 12:17.144
Everyone, put your
lions into a nose dive!

12:20.272 --> 12:21.524
<i>This is an expert-level drill</i>

12:21.607 --> 12:24.110
<i>you shouldn't attempt until
you've been flying for years,</i>

12:24.193 --> 12:27.613
but we're in a bit of
a rush, so here we go.

12:27.697 --> 12:29.532
Activating training helmets!

12:34.245 --> 12:36.872
Coran, what's happening? I can't see!

12:37.498 --> 12:40.001
<i>You must learn to
see through your lions' eyes.</i>

12:40.084 --> 12:43.963
<i>The goal is to pull up right
before you crash into the ground.</i>

12:44.046 --> 12:46.215
<i>Feel what the lion feels!</i>

12:46.298 --> 12:49.552
Mine feels scared!

12:53.139 --> 12:56.600
- You still going, Keith?
- You know it. You?

12:56.684 --> 13:00.104
- Going? I'm speeding up!
- Oh, yeah?

13:05.818 --> 13:08.863
- Must be getting close.
- Must be.

13:08.946 --> 13:11.615
- You getting scared?
- I'm not scared!

13:19.999 --> 13:21.083
I win.

13:21.167 --> 13:23.586
What was that noise?
Did they crash?

14:04.293 --> 14:05.711
I think I'm getting this.

14:06.670 --> 14:08.380
<i>Excellent, Shiro!</i>

14:11.342 --> 14:13.469
<i>The most important
part of paladin training</i>

14:13.552 --> 14:18.682
<i>is being able to meld your minds
and focus on one thing: Voltron.</i>

14:18.766 --> 14:21.060
<i>Everything else has to fade away.</i>

14:21.143 --> 14:25.106
<i>This technique will be essential
every time you form Voltron.</i>

14:25.189 --> 14:32.113
<i>So, relax and open your mind. No
walls, no secrets between paladins.</i>

14:32.488 --> 14:36.951
<i>Come on, everyone, clear everything.
Now, focus on forming your lion.</i>

14:38.702 --> 14:42.081
<i>Bring your lions
together and form Voltron.</i>

14:42.164 --> 14:45.584
<i>Keep your minds open,
work together. Good!</i>

14:45.668 --> 14:49.004
<i>Keep focusing! Only one to go!</i>

14:49.088 --> 14:51.340
Pidge, stop thinking of your girlfriend!

14:51.424 --> 14:53.759
I wasn't! Hunk was
rooting around in my head!

14:53.843 --> 14:56.262
I thought we were open. You
can look in my head hole.

14:56.345 --> 14:58.931
<i>Everyone has to be able to
look in everyone's head holes!</i>

14:59.014 --> 15:00.474
<i>Clear your minds!</i>

15:04.353 --> 15:05.396
<i>Good!</i>

15:06.272 --> 15:07.815
<i>Almost there.</i>

15:08.858 --> 15:10.484
Now, form Voltron.

15:14.780 --> 15:15.781
<i>Yes!</i>

15:17.366 --> 15:20.286
- Pidge!
- I'm done with this!

15:20.369 --> 15:22.705
Look, I don't like everyone
grubbing around in my head!

15:22.788 --> 15:25.708
Oh, come on, Pidge, we're
starting to get the hang of this.

15:25.791 --> 15:29.462
I'm just... I'm just tired, okay?

15:30.004 --> 15:32.339
Okay. Let's take a break.

15:33.883 --> 15:37.553
You have been working hard.
Maybe it's time to relax a little.

15:37.636 --> 15:40.931
What are you doing lying around?
You're supposed to be training!

15:41.015 --> 15:44.226
Just resting a bit. You
know, you can't push too hard.

15:44.310 --> 15:46.896
What do you mean,
"can't push too hard"?

15:46.979 --> 15:50.900
Get up, you lazy lumps! It's
time you faced the Gladiator!

15:53.319 --> 15:57.490
<i>In order to defeat the Gladiator,
five paladins must fight as one.</i>

15:59.783 --> 16:02.119
Hmm? Whoa!

16:40.783 --> 16:43.035
Shiro, are you okay?

16:50.376 --> 16:54.547
That combat simulator was set at
a level fit for an Altean child!

16:54.630 --> 16:56.674
You're not even close
to working as a team,

16:56.757 --> 16:58.842
let alone ready to face Zarkon!

17:00.052 --> 17:01.178
<i>Ahoy, young Paladins!</i>

17:01.262 --> 17:03.764
I've whipped up a big
batch of focusing food.

17:03.847 --> 17:06.809
After this meal, you'll be forming
Voltron six times a movement

17:06.892 --> 17:08.602
and twice on the astral conflux!

17:09.270 --> 17:11.646
Smells great, Coran. Thanks.

17:16.569 --> 17:17.694
Hold the phone!

17:17.778 --> 17:20.446
I saw a lot of solid
individual performances today,

17:20.531 --> 17:22.324
but you're still struggling
to work as a team.

17:23.032 --> 17:25.994
So, welcome to the final
bonding exercise of the day.

17:30.040 --> 17:32.501
Coran, I want you to think
about what you're doing.

17:32.585 --> 17:37.006
This one's a classic. You get to feed
each other, like a pack of yalmors!

18:23.636 --> 18:25.846
- Ow!
- Sorry.

18:26.889 --> 18:29.558
Ew!

18:30.434 --> 18:35.064
- Oh, nice. You defiled my food goo!
- It's your fault! This is ridiculous.

18:35.147 --> 18:38.609
Do Earthlings ever stop complaining?

18:38.692 --> 18:42.237
Can't you just give us a break?
Everyone's been working really hard today.

18:42.321 --> 18:46.533
Yeah! We're not some prisoners for
you to toy with, like... like...

18:46.617 --> 18:50.162
- Like a bunch of toy prisoners!
- Yes! Thank you, Lance!

18:50.871 --> 18:52.748
You do not yell at the Princess!

18:52.831 --> 18:54.625
Oh, the princess of what?

18:54.708 --> 18:57.628
We're the only ones out here
and she's no princess of ours!

19:02.758 --> 19:04.218
Go loose, Pidge!

19:10.724 --> 19:12.351
Oh, it's on now.

19:35.874 --> 19:38.794
Enough!
Do you see what you're doing?

19:39.878 --> 19:42.673
You're finally working together as one!

19:43.298 --> 19:45.384
Hey, she's right!

19:45.467 --> 19:47.302
I actually don't hate you right now.

19:47.386 --> 19:48.846
You guys thinking what I'm thinking?

19:48.929 --> 19:50.556
Let's go form Voltron!

19:50.639 --> 19:51.932
<i>Yeah!</i>

19:52.015 --> 19:55.227
Actually, I was thinking
dessert. But, yeah! Let's do it!

20:25.632 --> 20:27.176
Everyone ready to do this?

20:29.011 --> 20:30.012
Roger that!

20:32.014 --> 20:33.015
It's on!

20:35.267 --> 20:36.268
Yes, sir!

20:38.437 --> 20:39.688
I was born ready!

20:44.276 --> 20:45.527
Then let's go!

20:45.986 --> 20:46.820
Yeah!

21:32.533 --> 21:34.576
I told you I
could get them to do it.

21:34.660 --> 21:36.411
They just needed a common enemy.

21:36.995 --> 21:41.291
It's true. Like the old proverb says,
"A man can be driven to do anything,

21:41.375 --> 21:44.753
if a beautiful woman is just
really, really mean to him."

21:46.171 --> 21:47.464
Man, that was cool!

21:47.548 --> 21:50.759
I'm so charged up, I don't know if
I'm going to be able to sleep tonight.

21:50.843 --> 21:54.847
Not me. When my head hits the
pillow, I'm going to be lights out.

21:54.930 --> 21:57.933
I just want you to know that I
realized when we were in Voltron,

21:58.016 --> 21:59.685
we're brothers, man.

21:59.768 --> 22:01.812
You know? Like, we're totally connected.

22:01.813 --> 22:03.856
No secrets, no barriers, no nothing.

22:03.939 --> 22:06.024
Brothers all the way.

22:06.108 --> 22:07.317
I love you guys.

22:07.401 --> 22:09.862
G-forces mess with
your head a little bit?

22:09.945 --> 22:13.115
Yeah, maybe a little. I don't know.
It's been a tough few days.

22:15.576 --> 22:17.786
- Going to bed, Pidge?
- In a minute.

22:17.870 --> 22:20.789
Good work today. We're
really coming together.

22:38.181 --> 22:40.976
This beast will allow us
to destroy the paladins.

22:41.602 --> 22:44.563
And then, Voltron will be ours.
