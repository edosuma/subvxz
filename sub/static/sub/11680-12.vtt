WEBVTT

00:04.152 --> 00:07.349
We got a burn notice on you,
you're black listed.

00:07.384 --> 00:09.750
<i>When you're burned,
you've got nothing --</i>

00:09.785 --> 00:12.337
<i>No cash, no credit,
no job history.</i>

00:12.372 --> 00:14.732
<i>You're stuck in whatever city
they decide to dump you in.</i>

00:14.767 --> 00:16.446
Where am I?
Miami.

00:16.447 --> 00:19.004
<i>You do whatever work
comes your way.</i>

00:19.039 --> 00:22.594
<i>You rely on anyone
who's still talking to you.</i>

00:22.629 --> 00:25.660
<i>A trigger-happy ex-girlfriend...
Should we shoot them?</i>

00:25.695 --> 00:28.299
<i>...An old friend who used
to inform on you to the fbi...</i>

00:28.334 --> 00:30.493
You know spies --
a bunch of bitchy little girls.

00:30.528 --> 00:32.894
<i>...Family, too...
Hey, is that your mom again?</i>

00:32.929 --> 00:35.430
<i>...If you're desperate.
Someone needs your help,
michael.</i>

00:35.465 --> 00:37.884
<i>Bottom line --
as long as you're burned,</i>

00:37.919 --> 00:40.460
<i>You're not going anywhere.</i>

00:45.040 --> 00:46.913
<i>It's never fun to be the guy</i>

00:46.914 --> 00:49.065
<i>Who clears a location
for a meet.</i>

00:49.100 --> 00:50.936
<i>In the best case,
you waste your time</i>

00:50.937 --> 00:52.921
<i>Looking for dangers
that aren't there.</i>

00:52.956 --> 00:56.204
<i>In the worst case, of course,
you miss something.</i>

00:58.115 --> 01:01.028
Hey, your buddy went in
10 minutes ago, alone.

01:01.063 --> 01:02.877
Sam, you didn't
have to scout this for me.

01:02.878 --> 01:06.042
Come on, mikey,
I am not gonna let you
Meet a guy like gilroy
without backup.

01:06.077 --> 01:09.127
If he was planning on killing me,
I doubt he'd pick such a nice place.

01:09.162 --> 01:10.726
Do you know how hard it is
to get a reservation in there?

01:10.727 --> 01:12.669
Yeah, and I know
what they serve in there, too --

01:12.704 --> 01:13.935
Foie gras...

01:13.936 --> 01:15.836
"lap-in."

01:15.996 --> 01:17.551
<i>Lapin?</i>

01:17.552 --> 01:19.302
Yeah, whatever. It's still
french for "bunny rabbit."

01:19.303 --> 01:20.762
Look, I'm all for
bringing gilroy down,

01:20.763 --> 01:22.537
But isn't there a way
to wrap this guy up

01:22.538 --> 01:23.588
Without actually
working with him?

01:23.589 --> 01:25.117
I went to a lot of trouble
to convince him

01:25.118 --> 01:27.174
I'm as much of a psychopath
as he is.

01:27.209 --> 01:28.842
Might as well hear
what he has planned.

01:28.843 --> 01:31.008
Odds are he's not gonna ask you
to walk his dog for him.

01:31.043 --> 01:32.369
Well, I don't have
much choice.

01:32.370 --> 01:34.587
<i>Whatever he is planning,
the only way to stop it</i>

01:34.622 --> 01:36.722
Is to be right
in the middle of it.

01:36.757 --> 01:38.345
<i>Bon appÃ©tit.</i>

01:38.346 --> 01:41.273
That's french for
"watch your back, amigo."

01:41.308 --> 01:43.738
<i>Even routine meetings
can be risky</i>

01:43.773 --> 01:46.012
<i>If you're sitting down
with someone you don't trust.</i>

01:46.047 --> 01:48.365
<i>You have to be alert
to any subtle clue</i>

01:48.400 --> 01:50.321
<i>That tells you
what you're walking into.</i>

01:53.299 --> 01:55.704
<i>Are they armed?
Did they bring backup?</i>

01:58.335 --> 01:59.998
<i>Of course, there are also
not-so-subtle clues...</i>

01:59.999 --> 02:02.942
Glad you could make it.
I hope you don't mind.

02:02.977 --> 02:05.550
I took the liberty of ordering
an appetizer to start.

02:05.585 --> 02:08.967
<i>...Like a third place setting
at a lunch for two.</i>

02:09.002 --> 02:10.509
We expecting
someone else?

02:10.511 --> 02:12.390
I didn't tell you?
Claude should be here.

02:12.391 --> 02:13.039
Claude?

02:13.040 --> 02:15.434
Wonderful chap.
Excellent conversationalist.

02:15.469 --> 02:16.988
Has great fashion sense,

02:16.989 --> 02:18.945
And he's the best thief
in the western hemisphere.

02:18.980 --> 02:21.760
Useful skill in this phase
of our little project.

02:21.795 --> 02:23.276
I don't mind sharing a meal
with him,

02:23.277 --> 02:25.020
But, uh, I prefer
to work alone.

02:25.021 --> 02:27.314
Don't be so hasty, michael.
You'll like claude.

02:27.349 --> 02:29.701
His rÃ©sumÃ© is almost
as nasty as yours.

02:29.736 --> 02:32.149
Working with someone you don't
know is stupid and dangerous.

02:32.184 --> 02:34.020
Look who's full
of theories.

02:34.021 --> 02:36.225
Well, I'm afraid you'll have to
make an exception this time,

02:36.260 --> 02:38.151
Learn the value
of teamwork.

02:38.152 --> 02:40.167
No thanks.

02:41.631 --> 02:43.484
Claude, michael.

02:43.485 --> 02:45.002
Michael, claude.

02:45.003 --> 02:47.097
So, this is
your local boy?

02:48.001 --> 02:50.814
Actually, michael's not sure
he can stay for lunch.

02:50.849 --> 02:53.544
Decision time.

03:01.275 --> 03:03.195
Splendid.

03:03.230 --> 03:05.440
Let's get some wine, shall we?
To celebrate.

03:05.475 --> 03:08.531
Something old, french,
and...Expensive.

03:19.594 --> 03:21.687
What exactly
is this gilroy job?

03:21.722 --> 03:24.097
He wants me to break in to the
chilean consulate with claude,

03:24.132 --> 03:25.843
Get our hands on a file.

03:25.844 --> 03:27.833
Invading foreign territory
and stealing documents

03:27.868 --> 03:30.152
With someone you've never met --
sounds great.

03:30.187 --> 03:32.087
Working with claude
is not in the cards.

03:32.089 --> 03:34.599
Well, that I like the sound of.
Are you walking away?

03:34.634 --> 03:36.666
No. I'm gonna come up with a way
to take claude out

03:36.701 --> 03:38.708
Without making gilroy
suspicious.

03:38.743 --> 03:41.374
You know, if he is a thief
working internationally...

03:41.409 --> 03:44.099
You're thinking we might
have mutual acquaintances.

03:44.134 --> 03:45.698
I'll make some calls,
michael.

03:45.699 --> 03:47.774
But seriously, how far
are you willing to go

03:47.809 --> 03:49.948
With this gilroy thing?

03:49.983 --> 03:51.105
As far as I have to.

03:51.106 --> 03:53.340
That's easy
to say now, but --
[ engine revs ]

03:59.938 --> 04:02.613
Sugar: There's the man
I need to see.

04:02.648 --> 04:04.326
I come in peace, bro.

04:04.327 --> 04:05.689
Friend of yours, michael?

04:05.690 --> 04:07.376
You remember sugar,

04:07.377 --> 04:09.594
The drug dealer who used to live
beneath my place.

04:09.629 --> 04:12.184
That's right,
the man you shot in the leg.

04:12.219 --> 04:14.500
Yeah, your boy capped me
through a wall.

04:14.535 --> 04:16.435
Did something
with duct tape.

04:18.105 --> 04:19.723
I thought
I made it clear

04:19.724 --> 04:21.512
That we should never
see each other again.

04:21.512 --> 04:23.413
You think I wanted
to come back here?

04:24.054 --> 04:26.315
I came to hire you, man.

04:26.350 --> 04:28.426
My cousin's in trouble.
Don't waste your time.

04:28.461 --> 04:30.162
Look, dude, I didn't come here
empty-handed, all right?

04:30.163 --> 04:33.613
<i>In covert ops, you get used
to seeing old enemies.</i>

04:33.648 --> 04:35.703
<i>Sometimes they're looking
for intelligence.</i>

04:35.738 --> 04:37.867
<i>Sometimes they're looking
for revenge.</i>

04:37.902 --> 04:40.297
What are you gonna do,
shoot me again?

04:40.332 --> 04:42.273
'cause if that's what it takes
to get you to help my cousin,

04:42.308 --> 04:45.013
Go for it.

04:45.048 --> 04:48.101
<i>And sometimes
they're looking for a friend.</i>

04:54.429 --> 04:56.774
My cousin is messing with
shady dudes right now.

04:56.809 --> 04:58.835
Shady?
Shady like drug dealers?

04:58.870 --> 05:00.938
I don't bring my business
around dougie. I never have.

05:00.973 --> 05:02.910
It's this jacker named lynch.

05:02.945 --> 05:04.996
Punkass runs a crew
that does big robberies.

05:05.031 --> 05:08.022
Every time they do a job,
somebody gets hurt...Or worse.

05:08.057 --> 05:11.173
They're working an angle on dougie.
What makes you say that?

05:11.208 --> 05:13.544
They're not hanging out with him
'cause they think he's cool.

05:15.395 --> 05:17.419
D-dougie's slow.

05:17.454 --> 05:19.346
I told him to stay away
from lynch and his crew,

05:19.347 --> 05:21.693
But they keep buying him stuff
and taking him to parties.

05:21.728 --> 05:23.795
I mean,
he thinks they're friends.

05:23.830 --> 05:27.003
I talked to lynch, man-to-man,
told him to leave dougie alone.

05:27.038 --> 05:29.027
I can see that went well.

05:29.062 --> 05:30.410
His whole crew jumped me.

05:30.411 --> 05:32.095
There wasn't much talking
after that.

05:32.096 --> 05:33.877
These guys are strapped, man.

05:33.878 --> 05:35.521
I need a guy like you,
with the tricks and everything.

05:35.522 --> 05:36.927
Five grand.

05:36.928 --> 05:39.227
I'm figuring we mount up
and ride on these jokers.

05:39.262 --> 05:40.664
How's that sound?

05:40.665 --> 05:42.367
Like a good way
to get somebody killed.

05:42.368 --> 05:44.198
You don't need
a hit man, sugar.

05:44.199 --> 05:46.652
You need to move your cousin,
get him off of lynch's radar.

05:46.687 --> 05:49.200
You know how long it took dougie
to get on his own two feet?

05:49.235 --> 05:50.933
He's got his own place now,
a job.

05:50.934 --> 05:52.629
I can't make him start over.

05:52.630 --> 05:54.568
I'm not gonna let lynch
do that to him.

05:54.603 --> 05:57.166
If you don't want the money,
fine, I'll do it myself.

05:57.201 --> 05:59.347
I'm sure dougie
would rather start over

05:59.382 --> 06:01.183
Than have to bury his cousin.

06:01.184 --> 06:02.904
What happened to the badass
that used to live here?

06:02.905 --> 06:05.440
When he comes back,
give him my number.

06:08.737 --> 06:11.039
You're just gonna
let him go?

06:14.538 --> 06:17.358
Yeah? Ma?
Are you okay?

06:17.393 --> 06:18.897
No, I'm coming right over.

06:18.898 --> 06:21.215
It's mom.
It's -- it's important.

06:28.636 --> 06:31.622
You're getting the "take a bite
out of crime" award?

06:31.657 --> 06:34.018
It's for citizen
crime fighters.

06:34.053 --> 06:35.922
This just happened
out of the blue?

06:35.923 --> 06:37.460
Well, I mean, you know

06:37.461 --> 06:39.704
That I'm the neighborhood-watch
captain for my block,

06:39.739 --> 06:41.208
And it didn't hurt

06:41.209 --> 06:43.816
That I called in three stolen
cars in the last two months.

06:43.851 --> 06:46.805
<i>You mean the cars I asked you
to call in, the ones I stole?</i>

06:46.840 --> 06:48.740
They're giving me
a plaque!

06:49.448 --> 06:52.670
Now, I'm allowed to have
one guest at the reception,

06:52.705 --> 06:54.144
But you have to dress up,

06:54.145 --> 06:56.101
Because the chief of police
is gonna be there.

06:56.136 --> 06:58.753
Mom, I can't be
in a room full of cops

06:58.788 --> 07:02.739
<i>Giving you an award for
reporting crimes I committed!</i>

07:02.774 --> 07:04.332
Michael,
I'm being honored.

07:04.333 --> 07:06.278
Do you want me to be the only
person there with no family?

07:06.313 --> 07:09.010
I mean, it's not like I can
ask nate to fly in from vegas.

07:09.909 --> 07:12.597
Saturday at noon.

07:12.632 --> 07:14.565
Hey, guys.
Hi, honey.

07:14.600 --> 07:16.128
Hey, maddy,
you got some sugar?

07:16.129 --> 07:18.825
Ms. Reynolds wants to make me
some caramelized strawberries.

07:18.860 --> 07:20.909
Whoo-hoo.
Thanks.

07:20.944 --> 07:23.154
Hey, you saw about the award.
Pretty cool, huh?

07:23.189 --> 07:24.975
Sam nominated me.

07:24.976 --> 07:26.173
Well, more like
I signed the paperwork

07:26.174 --> 07:27.656
That she already filled out.

07:27.657 --> 07:28.506
Hey, so, is fi gonna help you
check into claude?

07:28.507 --> 07:31.159
She's asking around.

07:31.194 --> 07:33.035
Good, 'cause I ran his name
through some channels,

07:33.036 --> 07:34.553
And I got nothing.

07:34.554 --> 07:35.848
Thanks, maddy.

07:35.849 --> 07:38.053
I'll bring some over later.

07:39.043 --> 07:41.213
So...

07:47.329 --> 07:49.229
Hi, fi.

07:51.467 --> 07:53.367
So?

07:54.988 --> 07:57.171
What?

07:57.206 --> 07:59.588
Did you get a chance
to make any calls?

07:59.623 --> 08:01.872
Oh, you mean about claude?
I sure did.

08:01.907 --> 08:04.277
Heard some disturbing things,
too.

08:04.312 --> 08:05.910
I wrote it all down
on a piece of paper,

08:05.911 --> 08:07.770
But I just can't remember
where I put it.

08:07.771 --> 08:09.488
I'm very distracted.

08:09.489 --> 08:11.743
I keep thinking
about sugar and his cousin.

08:11.778 --> 08:14.366
You were there, fi.
I told him what he needed to do.

08:14.401 --> 08:18.640
If he doesn't want to listen,
that's not my problem.
What about dougie?

08:18.675 --> 08:20.131
Are we gonna let sugar

08:20.132 --> 08:22.248
Make a bad decision
for his cousin, too?

08:25.690 --> 08:28.337
Forget it.

08:28.372 --> 08:32.645
Claude is former
australian s.I.S.

08:32.679 --> 08:35.914
Real name, tomas smalling,

08:35.948 --> 08:37.950
Which is why
sam hit a dead end.

08:41.217 --> 08:43.515
You say
sugar's not your problem?

08:43.551 --> 08:44.930
Did you ever stop
and think

08:44.931 --> 08:48.127
Gilroy's not
your problem, either?

08:57.857 --> 08:59.972
My man!

09:01.265 --> 09:03.269
Yeah, okay.

09:05.665 --> 09:08.743
Guns and duct tape.
When do we go?

09:09.499 --> 09:11.814
<i>We don't go ever, sugar.</i>

09:11.849 --> 09:13.227
You said you would help.

09:13.228 --> 09:14.282
<i>I will, but my way,</i>

09:14.283 --> 09:16.552
So no mounting up,
no riding on people.

09:16.587 --> 09:18.868
Okay, so, how's your way?
Go through the roof?

09:18.903 --> 09:20.265
Go "mission: Impossible"
on his ass?

09:20.266 --> 09:23.376
That would fall
into the riding
category, so, no, no.

09:23.411 --> 09:24.756
First, I check into lynch,

09:24.757 --> 09:26.482
See why he's so interested
in your cousin.

09:26.483 --> 09:28.043
What about me?

09:28.044 --> 09:29.884
You're gonna leave town.

09:29.885 --> 09:30.987
Oh.

09:30.988 --> 09:33.087
I ride the pine
while you handle this?

09:33.122 --> 09:35.868
That punk sent guys looking
for me at a club I work out of.

09:35.903 --> 09:37.420
I mean, I need to answer.

09:37.421 --> 09:38.507
Yeah, that's the kind
of thinking we don't need.

09:38.508 --> 09:41.319
<i>You want to help your cousin?
You want me to help?</i>

09:41.354 --> 09:42.384
Then you will leave town.

09:42.385 --> 09:45.017
You will take a trip,
and you will wait for my call.

09:46.480 --> 09:48.591
Fine.

09:51.140 --> 09:54.440
Great.
Now, where can I find lynch?

09:55.762 --> 09:59.001
<i>Whether it's a drug compound
in the mountains of colombia</i>

09:59.036 --> 10:01.215
<i>Or a tropical estate in miami,</i>

10:01.250 --> 10:03.708
<i>Nothing says success
like a lot of land.</i>

10:03.720 --> 10:06.092
<i>Of course,
the more land someone has,</i>

10:06.127 --> 10:08.749
<i>The easier it is to hide out
and do surveillance.</i>

10:08.784 --> 10:10.684
<i>Lush landscaping
may be beautiful,</i>

10:10.706 --> 10:12.554
<i>But it's hardly secure.</i>

10:12.555 --> 10:14.771
I see two on the deck,
including lynch.

10:14.806 --> 10:17.985
Let me guess --
the one with the pinky ring.

10:18.020 --> 10:19.713
How's it going, fi?

10:19.714 --> 10:21.949
Single-latch sliding window

10:21.984 --> 10:23.571
On the side of the house.

10:23.572 --> 10:26.325
Getting in shouldn't be
a problem once they leave.

10:26.360 --> 10:28.195
Well, lynch and his crew
stay plenty busy.

10:28.196 --> 10:30.599
They've hit everything
from banks to car washes.

10:30.634 --> 10:32.730
How is it
they don't get arrested?

10:32.765 --> 10:35.022
Well, lynch is pretty thorough
about covering his tracks.

10:35.057 --> 10:37.359
They don't leave anybody around
to tell the story.

10:37.394 --> 10:39.668
That guy's
a public health hazard.

10:45.228 --> 10:48.022
Could be game time. Fi,
don't forget to plant that bug.

10:51.978 --> 10:53.812
A minivan.

10:53.813 --> 10:55.769
Lynch doesn't strike me
as the soccer-dad type.

10:55.804 --> 10:57.646
Well, it can't hurt to find out
where they're headed.

10:57.647 --> 10:59.705
Can you two handle the house
while I follow lynch?

10:59.740 --> 11:01.493
So, we're gonna
take the bus home?

11:01.494 --> 11:04.457
Okay, fine. Save gas.
Help the planet.

11:04.492 --> 11:06.581
Hey, I'm as green
as the next guy, you know.

11:08.171 --> 11:10.868
<i>Finding the best place
in a house to hide a bug</i>

11:10.903 --> 11:12.037
<i>Can be tough,</i>

11:12.038 --> 11:14.082
<i>But if you can't wire
every room for sound,</i>

11:14.117 --> 11:17.375
<i>The tv remote is
a good all-purpose choice.</i>

11:17.410 --> 11:18.679
<i>It's got a power source,</i>

11:18.680 --> 11:20.580
<i>It's kept in areas
where people gather,</i>

11:20.605 --> 11:22.071
<i>And it's usually in the hand</i>

11:22.072 --> 11:24.321
<i>Of the most powerful guy
in the room.</i>

11:25.099 --> 11:26.481
Bug's in place, sam.

11:26.482 --> 11:28.697
Look around,
but make it quick.

11:48.121 --> 11:49.709
Sam?
I found something.

11:49.710 --> 11:50.997
What are you seeing?

11:50.998 --> 11:52.882
Looks like lynch h
something special planned,

11:52.883 --> 11:54.595
<i>Something very special.</i>

11:54.596 --> 11:56.812
Special?
How do you mean?

11:56.847 --> 11:58.907
He's got enough firepower

11:58.942 --> 12:00.860
For a full-scale
amphibious assault --

12:00.895 --> 12:03.423
Machine guns, mini oxygen tanks,
dive wqtches.

12:04.429 --> 12:07.475
Maybe he's planning
some sort of water heist.

12:07.510 --> 12:09.615
Either that
or he likes to snorkel.

12:09.650 --> 12:12.095
Get your pictures
and get out of there, fi.

12:22.203 --> 12:23.360
<i>You can often tell</i>

12:23.361 --> 12:26.688
<i>When a team of guys
is going out to kill someone.</i>

12:26.723 --> 12:28.533
<i>There's something
about the way they drive --</i>

12:28.534 --> 12:32.282
<i>Always below the speed limit,
always careful at stop signs.</i>

12:34.239 --> 12:36.145
<i>There's something
about the way they move --</i>

12:36.180 --> 12:39.682
<i>A little strut,
a hard set to the jaw.</i>

12:39.717 --> 12:42.331
<i>See it enough times,
you don't even need clues</i>

12:42.366 --> 12:45.241
<i>Like the target's car
sitting in the driveway.</i>

12:47.653 --> 12:49.160
Sugar:
Time to get busy?

12:49.161 --> 12:51.068
Sugar,
tell me you left town.

12:51.103 --> 12:54.210
No, man, don't worry.
Dug in at my stash house.

12:54.245 --> 12:55.794
Nobody knows where it is.

12:55.795 --> 12:57.657
Lynch knows.
He's out front.

12:57.658 --> 12:59.036
Go out back right now.

12:59.037 --> 13:00.646
What?

13:00.647 --> 13:02.145
Oh, he wants
to go "tombstone"?

13:02.146 --> 13:03.616
Fine!
I'm strapped to the nines!

13:03.617 --> 13:05.055
We can settle this
right now!

13:05.056 --> 13:06.615
No, no, sugar.
There's too many.

13:06.616 --> 13:08.537
Get out now.
Get out now!

13:08.572 --> 13:10.984
No go, bro. I'm not letting him
run me out of my house!

13:44.501 --> 13:47.248
<i>Microwaves are one of the most
dangerous appliances</i>

13:47.283 --> 13:49.205
<i>In the home
to repair or modify,</i>

13:49.240 --> 13:50.143
<i>But in a pinch,</i>

13:50.144 --> 13:53.661
<i>You can use their extremely
high voltage to your advantage.</i>

13:53.696 --> 13:56.118
Did he go down?
I don't know.
I can't see.

13:57.950 --> 14:00.541
<i>Remove a microwave's
surge inhibitor,</i>

14:00.576 --> 14:03.412
<i>Mix in some reactive
household cleaning supplies</i>

14:03.447 --> 14:07.803
<i>And pressurized cans
and a fistful of silverware...</i>

14:16.772 --> 14:18.215
I think we got him.

14:18.216 --> 14:20.147
Let's make sure.
Cover .

14:22.638 --> 14:25.011
<i>...Make sure t door
is sealed tight...</i>

14:25.046 --> 14:27.233
<i>Now you want
to use duct tape.</i>

14:30.436 --> 14:34.598
<i>...And to save time,
just press "popcorn."</i>

14:39.382 --> 14:43.637
<i>Do it right, and you have
the makings of a very big...</i>

14:51.535 --> 14:54.170
Sorry, bro.
I'm staining your leather.

14:54.205 --> 14:55.709
You better stay alive,

14:55.710 --> 14:58.471
'cause I'm gonna make you
clean that later.

15:10.096 --> 15:12.162
Four shots
from assault rifles,

15:12.197 --> 15:14.307
And somehow sugar
is still breathing.

15:14.342 --> 15:15.571
I talked to the doctor.

15:15.572 --> 15:17.452
He's touch-and-go, but if
you hadn't been there, mike,

15:17.453 --> 15:19.082
He would have just been go.

15:19.083 --> 15:20.926
Police say anything?

15:20.927 --> 15:22.763
Uh, drug dealer gunned down
in a stash house

15:22.764 --> 15:25.147
Doesn't exactly get you,
you know, front-burner status.

15:25.182 --> 15:26.615
The car they were using
was torched,

15:26.616 --> 15:28.382
So there's no evidence
there.

15:28.383 --> 15:30.855
We need to get dougie
out of town.
No.

15:30.890 --> 15:32.167
We pull sugar's cousin
out now,

15:32.168 --> 15:33.659
Lynch just moves on
to a new heist.

15:33.660 --> 15:35.371
Someone else winds up
in his crosshairs.

15:35.372 --> 15:36.984
I want this
to be his last job.

15:36.985 --> 15:39.024
I'm glad to see you
so fired up, michael,

15:39.059 --> 15:41.472
But is this about taking
lynch down or helping dougie?
Both.

15:41.507 --> 15:43.385
As long as lynch needs dougie
for a job,

15:43.386 --> 15:45.349
He's safe
until it goes down.

15:45.384 --> 15:46.400
Well, that's great,

15:46.401 --> 15:48.234
Except we know nothing
about this job.

15:48.235 --> 15:50.220
Well, we have some work
to do, don't we?

15:50.255 --> 15:51.652
M:
Guys, how about this --

15:51.653 --> 15:53.063
Mike, you still
have your meeting

15:53.064 --> 15:54.516
With gilroy and claude,
right?

15:54.517 --> 15:56.824
Focus on that.
I'll talk to dougie.

15:56.859 --> 15:58.154
He's been hanging out
with lynch.

15:58.155 --> 15:59.437
Maybe he heard something.

15:59.438 --> 16:00.912
And if we have to move him
on short notice,

16:00.913 --> 16:02.193
I'm a familiar face.

16:02.194 --> 16:04.094
Great.

16:04.269 --> 16:08.946
Fiona, maybe I could
borrow your car?

16:08.981 --> 16:11.476
The charger's
a little stained.

16:21.548 --> 16:23.405
Gentlemen.

16:23.406 --> 16:25.306
I can't stay for long.

16:25.326 --> 16:27.880
I just wanted to make sure
that our first strategy session

16:27.915 --> 16:29.747
Gets off on the right foot.

16:29.748 --> 16:31.187
Team building is a process,

16:31.188 --> 16:32.709
So I thought
I'd help speed it up.

16:32.710 --> 16:35.284
Matching watches,
perfectly synchronized...

16:35.319 --> 16:37.115
With mine.

16:37.116 --> 16:38.791
If you look like a team,
you'll act like one.

16:38.792 --> 16:40.181
Maybe we should
get jerseys.

16:40.182 --> 16:43.351
Feast your eyes
on the third-floor window

16:43.386 --> 16:44.886
Second from the left.

16:44.887 --> 16:47.514
My file arrives in that room
on Friday evening.

16:47.549 --> 16:50.053
On Sunday morning,
it's headed for processing.

16:50.088 --> 16:51.855
You two will get it Saturday.

16:51.856 --> 16:55.721
Since claude has the expertise
in the getting-things field,

16:55.756 --> 16:57.197
He will take the lead.

16:57.198 --> 16:58.512
You don't mind,
do you, michael?

16:58.513 --> 17:00.070
Go, team.

17:00.071 --> 17:01.212
Excellent.

17:01.213 --> 17:02.568
Did you know
that your resting pulse

17:02.569 --> 17:03.848
Tends to synchronize
with your watch?

17:03.849 --> 17:08.743
That means, by the end of today,
our hearts will beat as one.

17:08.779 --> 17:11.021
I'll leave you both
to ponder the possibilities.

17:11.056 --> 17:13.429
Ta-ta.

17:15.669 --> 17:18.792
You just create a diversion.
Cover the alley.

17:18.828 --> 17:20.728
I get the file.

17:21.564 --> 17:22.700
That's it?

17:22.701 --> 17:24.070
You need more?

17:24.071 --> 17:25.492
How are you getting in?

17:25.493 --> 17:27.090
From the outside.
Not your problem.

17:27.092 --> 17:30.798
Well, it is if you want me to
stage an effective diversion.

17:30.833 --> 17:33.647
Look, just make certain
no one on the street

17:33.682 --> 17:36.016
Is looking down that alley
when the time comes.

17:36.051 --> 17:37.857
What about the security
on the third floor?

17:37.858 --> 17:39.265
One guard?

17:39.266 --> 17:44.486
If he sees me, it'll be
the last thing he ever sees.

17:52.350 --> 17:54.637
Autry: Usually, I get
some kind of advance notice

17:54.672 --> 17:56.054
Before somebody
pays a visit.

17:56.055 --> 17:57.544
Yeah, it's weird
how that goes.

17:57.545 --> 17:58.863
If you're with
the independent-living program,

17:58.864 --> 18:00.038
What happened
to ms. Lee?

18:00.039 --> 18:01.386
Who? Berta?
Yeah.

18:01.387 --> 18:02.722
No, no, she's county.
I'm city.

18:02.723 --> 18:04.989
State's gonna send somebody
in a month or two.

18:05.024 --> 18:06.932
Then a tri-joint panel
does their review.

18:06.967 --> 18:08.261
It's a whole big deal.

18:08.262 --> 18:10.793
Well, dougie's a big help
around here.

18:10.828 --> 18:12.388
We love him.
You'll see.

18:12.389 --> 18:14.289
Hey, dougie.

18:17.961 --> 18:19.846
Somebody from the program
wants to see you.

18:19.847 --> 18:21.503
Dougie, how you doing?
Chuck finley.

18:21.504 --> 18:22.968
I'm fine, sir.
Thanks.

18:22.969 --> 18:24.869
Tell him
what you do, dougie.
Okay.

18:27.976 --> 18:30.312
I have to make sure that
the door to the storage room

18:30.347 --> 18:32.412
Is shut real tight
before we open the big door

18:32.447 --> 18:34.744
So the bad air
doesn't get the flowers

18:34.779 --> 18:36.358
When the cars drive out,

18:36.359 --> 18:38.132
And then,
when the deliveries come in,

18:38.133 --> 18:41.059
I have to do the same thing,
except backwards.

18:41.094 --> 18:43.023
Sounds like a lot
to remember.

18:43.058 --> 18:45.846
I'm good at it.
Mr. Autry says I'm vigilant.

18:45.881 --> 18:48.187
[ laughs ]
oh, it's cold in here, isn't it?

18:48.222 --> 18:49.963
It's good
for the flowers.

18:49.964 --> 18:52.310
Were you in the navy?

18:52.345 --> 18:53.974
A-a lot of people in the navy
wear those.

18:53.975 --> 18:55.138
They're called luminox.

18:55.139 --> 18:56.921
Yeah. Good catch.
I was in the navy.

18:56.922 --> 18:59.036
Yeah, I tried out
to be in the army,

18:59.071 --> 19:01.521
But they said
I didn't pass the test.

19:02.577 --> 19:04.738
My friend, mr. Lynch --
he's a marine.

19:04.773 --> 19:06.600
He still goes on missions
sometimes.

19:06.601 --> 19:08.353
He said maybe
I could help out on one.

19:08.354 --> 19:10.056
That's cool.
When is it?

19:10.057 --> 19:12.829
I don't know.
I'm on alert status.

19:12.864 --> 19:14.546
Did he say
what you'd be doing?

19:14.547 --> 19:15.903
No.

19:15.904 --> 19:17.556
He just said to be ready.

19:17.557 --> 19:19.260
Well, mr. Lynch sounds
like a cool friend.

19:19.261 --> 19:21.788
You want to meet him?
He's having a party today.

19:21.823 --> 19:24.074
Oh, that sounds fun, dougie,
but I got a lot of work to do,

19:24.109 --> 19:25.406
So you go do your thing,

19:25.407 --> 19:27.100
And I'll catch up with you
in a bit.

19:27.101 --> 19:28.496
Okay.
See you later.

19:28.497 --> 19:30.584
Yeah, thanks.

19:32.818 --> 19:36.478
Fi, are you in a partying mood?

19:44.365 --> 19:48.407
<i>Infiltrating hostile territory
is all about blending in,</i>

19:48.442 --> 19:50.778
<i>Which means,
if you're a sniper in the bush,</i>

19:50.813 --> 19:52.394
<i>You wear a ghillie suit,</i>

19:52.395 --> 19:54.388
<i>And if you're a beautiful woman
at a miami house party,</i>

19:54.423 --> 19:57.357
<i>You wear a slinky dress.</i>

20:00.428 --> 20:04.193
Retard's looking bored.
Watch this.

20:04.228 --> 20:06.125
Dougie,
have a little shot with me.

20:06.126 --> 20:08.026
Cheers, pal.

20:09.824 --> 20:11.724
It's good, huh?

20:15.987 --> 20:18.740
Show us some moves.

20:18.775 --> 20:21.513
[ laughing ]
there it is, huh?

20:24.490 --> 20:27.019
Fantastic.

20:29.692 --> 20:32.221
Excuse me, folks.

20:32.256 --> 20:33.228
Thank you.

20:33.229 --> 20:35.178
Enjoy the party.

20:35.213 --> 20:37.169
Lynch just called
a meeting.

20:37.204 --> 20:38.650
That's great.
Stay close.

20:38.651 --> 20:40.701
Looks like it's members only.

20:40.736 --> 20:42.576
Well, then, you got
to join the club, fi.

20:42.577 --> 20:44.057
We got to get ears
on those guys.

20:44.058 --> 20:46.824
<i>A bug is only as good
as what it hears,</i>

20:46.859 --> 20:49.513
<i>So if the discussion
you want to be part of</i>

20:49.548 --> 20:52.096
<i>Isn't taking place
around your listening device,</i>

20:52.131 --> 20:53.518
<i>You have two choices.</i>

20:53.519 --> 20:57.241
<i>You can move the discussion,
or you can move the bug.</i>

20:57.050 --> 20:59.722
Uh, excuse me.
Excuse me.

20:59.757 --> 21:01.100
This room's
off-limits now.

21:01.101 --> 21:04.648
Well, I -- my car keys were
in my pocket, and I was --

21:04.683 --> 21:05.769
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Your keys --

21:05.770 --> 21:07.800
Your keys, honey, we can help
you find them later, all right?

21:07.835 --> 21:10.421
<i>No! They're in here.
Yeah, we'll help you
find them later.</i>

21:10.456 --> 21:11.448
If we can't find them,

21:11.449 --> 21:13.558
I'll give you a ride myself,
personally, all right?

21:13.593 --> 21:15.493
Call me.
Enjoy the party.

21:18.169 --> 21:20.205
I just got off the phone
with bolo.

21:20.240 --> 21:21.645
He said he found us a thief

21:21.646 --> 21:23.581
Who can get us the last piece
of hardware we need.

21:23.616 --> 21:25.525
Sweet. How soon
can we get it?

21:25.560 --> 21:27.350
He's making the intro tomorrow
with la covacha.

21:27.351 --> 21:28.924
Way to go, fi.

21:28.925 --> 21:29.835
<i>We got the retard.</i>

21:29.836 --> 21:32.208
<i>We'll get the hardware
and be good to go.</i>

21:35.066 --> 21:38.552
Those are some grade-a
sons of bitches in there.

21:41.757 --> 21:42.872
Where's your gun, sam?

21:42.873 --> 21:45.863
I moved it, fi,
for your own good.

21:45.898 --> 21:47.335
Look, if it'll make you
feel any better,

21:47.336 --> 21:49.833
I think your trick with the bug
gave us something we could use.

21:49.868 --> 21:51.534
Yeah, if we can use it
to bludgeon lynch to death,

21:51.535 --> 21:53.272
I'll feel much better.
One step at a time, fi.

21:53.273 --> 21:54.748
Lynch is meeting
with a thief.

21:54.749 --> 21:56.871
Good news is
he's never seen the guy.

21:56.906 --> 22:00.342
I know somebody else
he's never seen.

22:06.962 --> 22:09.087
You'll know bolo
when you see him?

22:09.122 --> 22:10.835
Yeah, I figured
if he's pimping thieves,

22:10.836 --> 22:12.796
He must be a fence,
so I called barry.

22:12.831 --> 22:13.942
He knew him,

22:13.943 --> 22:15.694
Gave me a description
of the guy and his car.

22:15.695 --> 22:18.767
And there it is.

22:20.458 --> 22:23.893
Got the cooperation juice
ready?

22:23.928 --> 22:25.408
Yeah, it's ready.

22:25.409 --> 22:27.309
Let's do this, doc.

22:38.673 --> 22:40.076
Bolo, right?

22:40.077 --> 22:41.834
Hey, uh, somebody
left a note for you.

22:41.835 --> 22:43.595
A note?
Yeah,
it's right back here.

22:43.596 --> 22:45.496
<i>Everyone knows
about the placebo effect.</i>

22:45.530 --> 22:47.323
<i>People get healed
by sugar water</i>

22:47.324 --> 22:48.605
<i>Because they think
it's medicine.</i>

22:48.606 --> 22:49.841
You can't just
bring it to me?

22:49.842 --> 22:50.889
Oh, it's right
around the corner here.

22:50.890 --> 22:53.845
<i>Of course, the placebo doesn't
just work for medicine.</i>

22:53.880 --> 22:56.362
Whoa, man! What the hell? You're
gonna want to hold still for this.

22:56.397 --> 22:59.749
<i>It turns out fake poisons
work pretty well, too,</i>

22:59.784 --> 23:02.258
<i>Which is useful when you need
someone terrified enough</i>

23:02.293 --> 23:03.863
<i>To do whatever you say.</i>

23:03.864 --> 23:04.775
You've just been injected

23:04.776 --> 23:07.235
With 3 cc's
of methyl chlorate benzamide.

23:07.270 --> 23:08.588
That's science talk for,

23:08.589 --> 23:11.106
"you got five hours to live,
unless you find an antidote."

23:11.141 --> 23:13.980
Oh, my god. Who are you guys? Man, what do
you -- doesn't matter. Shut up and focus.

23:14.015 --> 23:15.812
Now,
you'll get the antidote

23:15.813 --> 23:18.439
If and only if
you do exactly as say.

23:18.474 --> 23:19.615
Do you understand?

23:19.616 --> 23:21.083
I understand!
I understand!
Good.

23:21.084 --> 23:23.408
You are going to call whoever
you're introducing to lynch.

23:23.443 --> 23:25.827
You will tell him
to go back home.

23:25.862 --> 23:28.105
I am him today.
Right.

23:30.285 --> 23:31.784
Try to stay calm.

23:31.785 --> 23:33.271
The faster
your heart beats,

23:33.272 --> 23:35.584
The faster the poison
gets into your bloodstream.

23:35.619 --> 23:37.727
Man, I'm feeling a little,
uh -- a little, uh --

23:37.762 --> 23:40.380
Feverish?
Yeah.

23:40.415 --> 23:42.297
Well, that's what happens
when the chlorate kicks in.

23:42.298 --> 23:43.353
Your hands will shake.

23:43.354 --> 23:44.892
Then you'll have difficulty
controlling your bowels.

23:44.893 --> 23:47.516
Oh, god. Why'd you
do this to me, man?

23:47.551 --> 23:49.140
You'll be fine
if you get the antidote.

23:49.141 --> 23:52.854
Now pull yourself together
and make sure lynch likes me.

23:53.207 --> 23:56.992
Lynch, been a long
time, man. How you been?

23:57.027 --> 23:59.040
You been good?
You look good.

23:59.075 --> 24:00.681
Let's get to the introductions,
bolo.

24:00.682 --> 24:02.006
Right.

24:02.007 --> 24:05.129
This is d.J., the one man
who can get you what you want.

24:05.164 --> 24:08.550
You're familiar with heavy
equipment, right? Oh, yeah.

24:08.585 --> 24:10.736
He knows heavy equipment
like I know hot stones, man.

24:10.771 --> 24:13.007
Let's make a deal. You need
to stop talking for a minute.

24:13.042 --> 24:14.845
Let me talk to d.J.

24:14.846 --> 24:16.746
Cool.
Do your thing, man.

24:17.293 --> 24:19.353
You know what this is?

24:20.911 --> 24:24.213
Mm, that there's a hydraulic
cutter/spreader on steroids.

24:24.248 --> 24:26.347
Some people call it
the jaws of life.

24:26.382 --> 24:28.229
Can you get one for me?

24:28.230 --> 24:29.318
Are you kidding?

24:29.319 --> 24:31.205
D.J. Hot-wired a-a front loader

24:31.206 --> 24:32.582
And drove it
off a live construction site.

24:32.583 --> 24:33.708
You think he can't
get one of those, man?

24:33.709 --> 24:34.824
He can get anything you need.

24:34.825 --> 24:38.219
Won't be easy, seeing how
only emergency-response agencies

24:38.254 --> 24:39.933
Are allowed
to have that kind.

24:39.934 --> 24:41.578
Well, if I could get it
at walmart,

24:41.579 --> 24:44.680
I wouldn't need you,
would I?

24:46.386 --> 24:48.545
You sure you can't use
the step-down version?

24:48.580 --> 24:49.969
Still cuts through
metal like butter,

24:49.970 --> 24:51.129
Just takes a little longer.

24:51.130 --> 24:52.547
What are you cutting on?

24:52.548 --> 24:54.662
There's a can of tuna
I'm having trouble with.

24:55.911 --> 24:58.533
Yeah, where is this can of tuna?
Do you have a power source?

24:58.568 --> 25:01.050
I mean, the more details I know,
the better job I do.

25:01.085 --> 25:02.454
You don't get details.

25:02.455 --> 25:05.144
You get little pieces
of green paper called money...

25:05.179 --> 25:07.287
When I get my equipment.

25:07.322 --> 25:09.222
You want the gig or not?

25:09.252 --> 25:11.204
He wants it!
[ laughs ]

25:11.239 --> 25:13.731
I know a match when I see
a match, and this is a match.

25:13.766 --> 25:15.271
Can we shake on this, please?

25:15.272 --> 25:17.850
It's gonna take a few days for
your little dream to come true.

25:17.885 --> 25:20.130
[ laughs ]
you get one day.

25:20.165 --> 25:21.699
Otherwise,
I find somebody else.

25:21.700 --> 25:23.600
Oh, no. No, no.
You can't do that.

25:24.499 --> 25:25.810
[ chuckles nervously ]
tell him it's a deal.

25:25.811 --> 25:28.272
<i>Working undercover
is all about judgment calls.</i>

25:28.307 --> 25:30.386
<i>Give the bad guy
too little help,</i>

25:30.421 --> 25:31.861
<i>And you can't do your job.</i>

25:31.862 --> 25:33.298
D.J., say it's a deal.

25:33.299 --> 25:34.835
<i>Give the bad guy too much help,</i>

25:34.836 --> 25:37.333
<i>And you become part
of the problem. Deal.</i>

25:37.368 --> 25:38.705
<i>It's a tough call,</i>

25:38.706 --> 25:40.857
<i>But sometimes
things have to get worse</i>

25:40.892 --> 25:42.833
<i>Before they get better.</i>

25:51.354 --> 25:52.861
You know, I don't like this.

25:52.862 --> 25:54.751
We got all these pieces
and still no answer.

25:54.752 --> 25:56.652
Dougie's out there
flapping in the breeze,

25:56.681 --> 25:58.583
And now we have less than a day
to pull him in?

25:58.618 --> 26:00.293
There has to be a connection
to the flower mart.

26:00.294 --> 26:02.730
Otherwise,
they wouldn't need dougie.

26:02.765 --> 26:04.334
No, thing is,
there's not enough cash there

26:04.335 --> 26:05.890
To justify a major heist.

26:05.891 --> 26:08.099
And lynch isn't doing this
to steal a dozen roses.

26:08.134 --> 26:09.669
Well, those flowers
have to go somewhere.

26:09.670 --> 26:13.135
Lynch might be using a delivery
to get access to a target.

26:13.170 --> 26:14.856
Makes sense.

26:14.857 --> 26:16.760
He uses doug to sneak
his crew onto one of the vans.

26:16.795 --> 26:18.690
Well, now you're cooking
with gas.

26:18.691 --> 26:20.342
You order a bunch of tulips,

26:20.343 --> 26:22.274
And you get a full-scale heist
to go with it.

26:22.309 --> 26:23.808
I'll circle back
to the flower mart,

26:23.809 --> 26:25.822
Try and get my hands
on the delivery schedule.

26:26.571 --> 26:28.634
Fi, when sam gets
that schedule...

26:28.669 --> 26:31.746
He's gonna need help scouting
locations lynch might hit.

26:31.768 --> 26:34.545
Consider it covered.

26:35.333 --> 26:38.414
Oh, I got word on your friend
claude's preferred m.O.

26:38.449 --> 26:39.825
I don't know
if this helps any,

26:39.826 --> 26:41.231
But he's made a habit

26:41.232 --> 26:44.126
Of scaling the sides
of buildings -- free climbing.

26:44.161 --> 26:46.697
Helps a lot, fi.
Thanks.

26:48.576 --> 26:50.843
Michael, your ears
must have been burning!

26:50.878 --> 26:52.251
I was just calling you!

26:52.252 --> 26:54.842
Listen, about the reception --
I was wondering --

26:54.877 --> 26:57.288
Mom, where's
that city-inspector shirt

26:57.323 --> 27:00.145
Dad used to wear
when he was stealing equipment?

27:00.180 --> 27:02.201
You mean "borrowing."
uh, sure.

27:02.236 --> 27:04.094
Where is it?

27:04.095 --> 27:05.995
Move.

27:09.861 --> 27:11.747
A false wall?

27:11.748 --> 27:14.044
I'm surprised
you never found it before.

27:14.079 --> 27:17.848
Your dad liked to have a place
to keep his private stuff.

27:17.883 --> 27:19.824
Um, you should find
what you want in there.

27:19.859 --> 27:22.545
Anyway, so, I needed
a new outfit for Saturday,

27:23.464 --> 27:26.481
And while I was out,
I got something for you.

27:27.293 --> 27:29.546
You like it?

27:29.581 --> 27:30.852
Mom.

27:30.853 --> 27:32.219
I know it's not
exactly your style,

27:32.220 --> 27:34.070
But it goes great
with my skirt.

27:34.071 --> 27:37.468
About Saturday --
something's kind of come up.

27:37.503 --> 27:39.403
So, put it back down.

27:39.406 --> 27:41.458
I can't.
It's complicated.

27:41.493 --> 27:43.652
People could get hurt.

27:43.687 --> 27:47.187
Well, we certainly wouldn't
want that to happen.

27:47.222 --> 27:51.063
So, by all means,
do what it is you have to do.

27:51.098 --> 27:52.886
I bought it on clearance.

27:52.887 --> 27:55.692
I can't return it,
so you might as well keep it.

27:59.802 --> 28:01.660
Sam: Mr. Autry,
I know it's a pain,

28:01.661 --> 28:03.441
But I need your whole
delivery schedule.

28:03.442 --> 28:05.830
I'm a little busy right now.
Can't I just fax it later?

28:05.865 --> 28:07.414
Look, I'm sorry to rush you,
mr. Autry,

28:07.415 --> 28:08.703
But I got to have it now.

28:08.704 --> 28:10.285
I was supposed to turn
my report in yesterday,

28:10.286 --> 28:12.123
But the supe won't take it
without the schedule.

28:12.124 --> 28:14.212
All right, all right.
I'll be right back.

28:14.247 --> 28:16.147
Appreciate it.

28:19.363 --> 28:21.823
That's a pretty bouquet,
doug.
Thanks.

28:21.858 --> 28:24.108
Mr. Autry said I could
take flowers to my cousin.

28:24.143 --> 28:26.127
He got shot.

28:26.162 --> 28:27.445
Well, I'll tell you,

28:27.446 --> 28:29.344
Getting flowers helped me
when I got shot.

28:29.345 --> 28:31.977
You got shot?
In action?

28:32.012 --> 28:33.525
Yeah, we were pulling
some civilian workers

28:33.526 --> 28:34.862
Out of a hot spot
in kuwait.

28:34.863 --> 28:36.617
I caught a bullet
on the way out.

28:36.618 --> 28:37.926
After those flowers came,

28:37.927 --> 28:39.916
I got better
like lickety-split.

28:39.951 --> 28:42.149
That's cool.
I hope these work.

28:42.184 --> 28:43.557
Mr. Finley.

28:43.558 --> 28:45.935
All our deliveries
for the next two weeks.

28:45.970 --> 28:47.500
That is great.
Boy, have you bailed me out.

28:47.501 --> 28:49.556
Thanks.
See you, dougie.

28:52.201 --> 28:54.386
<i>Even the most skilled operative</i>

28:54.421 --> 28:56.991
<i>Knows a good plan
is 10% execution,</i>

28:57.026 --> 28:59.168
<i>90% preparation.</i>

28:59.203 --> 29:00.685
<i>Advance work is crucial</i>

29:00.686 --> 29:02.812
<i>If you want an operation
to be successful.</i>

29:02.847 --> 29:04.873
<i>Advance work is also crucial</i>

29:04.908 --> 29:08.387
<i>If you want an operation
to fail.</i>

29:08.422 --> 29:11.787
<i>For example, for someone who
likes to break into buildings</i>

29:11.822 --> 29:13.210
<i>By free climbing,</i>

29:13.211 --> 29:15.183
<i>Tampering
with potential handholds</i>

29:15.218 --> 29:18.251
<i>Could be
a very serious problem.</i>

29:20.768 --> 29:22.810
Fi, sam get the schedule?

29:22.845 --> 29:24.115
Fiona:
Yeah, any progress

29:24.116 --> 29:25.693
Getting the hydraulic cutters
lynch wants?

29:25.694 --> 29:27.982
I'm just on my way.

29:28.795 --> 29:31.372
<i>Jaws of life
are standard equipment</i>

29:31.407 --> 29:32.614
<i>For emergency-rescue outfits.</i>

29:32.615 --> 29:34.682
<i>If you'd rather not take a set
that might be needed,</i>

29:34.717 --> 29:36.845
<i>You don't steal them
from a fire station.</i>

29:36.880 --> 29:40.293
<i>A fire training center,
on the other hand,</i>

29:40.328 --> 29:42.603
<i>Can probably miss theirs
for a few days</i>

29:42.638 --> 29:44.538
<i>Without risking anyone's life.</i>

29:45.260 --> 29:46.878
Now, who sent you
to get our cutters?

29:46.879 --> 29:48.286
H.Q.
Routine maintenance.

29:48.287 --> 29:49.565
Have them back to you
in a few days.

29:49.566 --> 29:50.866
A heads-up
would have been nice.

29:50.867 --> 29:52.576
Tell you what -- why don't
you come back on Monday?

29:52.577 --> 29:54.373
We'll have them ready
for you then.
No can do.

29:54.374 --> 29:56.260
H.Q.'s already breathing
down our ass for falling behind.

29:56.261 --> 29:58.201
I got you and three other
firehouses I got to hit today.

29:58.236 --> 29:59.880
I don't know
what to tell you.

29:59.881 --> 30:01.897
See, it's my job to get recruits
ready to fight fires.

30:01.932 --> 30:04.000
I got a class training on those
cutters today and tomorrow,

30:04.035 --> 30:06.125
So, uh,
you have h.Q. Call me

30:06.160 --> 30:07.420
If they've got a problem
with this.

30:07.421 --> 30:10.214
What? You're using them
right now?!
Yeah.

30:11.610 --> 30:15.409
Shut it off! Shut it off!
Shut it down!

30:17.642 --> 30:19.331
What the hell
are you doing?
You see those twin lines?

30:19.332 --> 30:21.447
One wrong twist, and that thing
goes, "snap, crackle, pop!"

30:21.482 --> 30:22.783
That thing will start
flipping around

30:22.784 --> 30:24.185
Like a rattlesnake on pcp!

30:24.186 --> 30:25.512
You know what you can do then,
lieutenant?

30:25.513 --> 30:27.413
You take your right hand.
You wave goodbye to your left.

30:32.485 --> 30:34.225
Wait, wait, wait.
Hold on.

30:34.226 --> 30:36.559
Somebody want to help him
load them onto his truck?

30:36.594 --> 30:38.103
Yeah, that's heavy.

30:38.104 --> 30:39.087
Come on. Let's go.
Let's go.

30:39.088 --> 30:41.491
Act like you got
some sense here.

30:49.197 --> 30:50.609
Hey, mike.

30:50.610 --> 30:52.322
We got the location
on lynch's heist.

30:52.323 --> 30:54.287
Hotel milano --
it's the only one that fits.

30:54.322 --> 30:57.127
They're hosting an international
art auction, so there's loot.

30:57.162 --> 30:59.402
Back of the place lets out
onto the miami river.

30:59.437 --> 31:01.889
Easy water getaway
if you've got mini o2 tanks.

31:01.924 --> 31:03.370
How do hydraulic cutters
fit in?

31:03.371 --> 31:05.140
You ever seen
those steel crates

31:05.141 --> 31:06.854
They ship
priceless paintings in?

31:06.855 --> 31:08.828
You couldn't use torches
on those

31:08.863 --> 31:10.424
Without burning
the paintings.

31:10.425 --> 31:12.179
I'm telling you, mike,
it's got to be this one.

31:12.180 --> 31:13.955
It's got to be
the hotel milano.

31:13.956 --> 31:16.442
Best part is, flower mart is not
delivering till next week.

31:16.477 --> 31:18.430
We're off the clock.
That's right.

31:18.465 --> 31:20.331
You get those cutters
into lynch's hands tomorrow,

31:20.332 --> 31:22.032
We'll have plenty of time
to make sure

31:22.033 --> 31:23.933
He's walking
into a bear trap.

31:24.787 --> 31:25.914
Nice.

31:25.915 --> 31:27.403
Get it in the van.

31:27.404 --> 31:29.783
Listen, I, uh, sprinkled
a little extra cash in here

31:29.818 --> 31:32.707
Since you beat the clock.
I aim to please.

31:32.742 --> 31:35.043
You ever want to put in
some time with a real crew,

31:35.078 --> 31:36.868
You give me a call.

31:36.869 --> 31:39.158
Just might do that.

31:43.092 --> 31:45.716
Call the retard.
Make sure he's at work.

31:45.751 --> 31:47.544
I called him this morning.

31:47.545 --> 31:49.445
Call him again!

31:52.967 --> 31:54.280
Fi, get sam.

31:54.281 --> 31:55.776
Fiona:
What's going on?

31:55.777 --> 31:57.356
Lynch is on the move.
We missed something.

31:57.357 --> 31:59.570
I've checked. They can't be
headed to the flower mart.

31:59.605 --> 32:02.786
Then why would lynch
make sure dougie's at work?
Check again, sam.

32:02.821 --> 32:04.737
<i>There's nothing worse
than the feeling you get</i>

32:04.772 --> 32:07.574
<i>When you know you've made
a serious tactical mistake,</i>

32:07.609 --> 32:10.124
<i>When you thought you had
two days to deal with a problem</i>

32:10.159 --> 32:13.008
<i>And you realize you may not
even have two hours.</i>

32:13.043 --> 32:14.744
Oh, damn it.

32:14.745 --> 32:16.312
How did I miss that?

32:16.313 --> 32:19.794
<i>Because when you make mistakes
like that, people die.</i>

32:19.829 --> 32:22.387
Miss what, sam?
There's a pickup this afternoon
that's listed as "anderson."

32:22.422 --> 32:24.507
I figured
it was a guy named anderson,

32:24.542 --> 32:27.220
But it's got to be
anderson couriers,
an armored truck.

32:27.255 --> 32:28.542
Today's Friday,

32:28.543 --> 32:30.136
So they're probably doing
end-of-the-week pickups.

32:30.137 --> 32:31.627
This late in the day,

32:31.628 --> 32:33.303
That truck's gonna
be loaded with cash.

32:33.304 --> 32:34.824
We got to get
to the flower mart.

32:34.825 --> 32:37.634
Lynch's heist is going on
right now.

32:41.346 --> 32:43.240
<i>When you make a mistake
in the field,</i>

32:43.241 --> 32:46.679
<i>The key is to focus
on solutions, not regrets.</i>

32:46.714 --> 32:49.800
<i>Being sorry doesn't mean much
in combat situations.</i>

32:49.835 --> 32:52.462
<i>You can't apologize
to a corpse.</i>

32:53.696 --> 32:55.698
They're gonna hit the armored
truck in the loading bay.

32:55.733 --> 32:58.324
They needed dougie
to let them in.

32:59.359 --> 33:01.087
Mike, they got a guy
on the roof.

33:01.088 --> 33:03.701
They're gonna gas
the loading bay.

33:03.736 --> 33:05.498
It's sealed to keep
the flowers fresh.

33:05.499 --> 33:07.060
They'll kill everyone
and then cut open the truck

33:07.061 --> 33:08.119
With the jaws of life.

33:08.120 --> 33:10.256
And they use the oxygen tanks
to breathe, the bastards.

33:10.272 --> 33:12.900
How much time do we have?
Armored truck is due
any minute.

33:12.935 --> 33:14.809
Fi, can you make sure
that truck leaves in a hurry?

33:14.810 --> 33:17.076
Sam, you take the guy
on the roof.

33:17.111 --> 33:18.280
I'll get dougie out.

33:18.281 --> 33:20.806
No, no, mike, he knows me.
I'll get him out.

33:20.841 --> 33:23.040
Seriously, I got it.

33:25.815 --> 33:29.013
Hey, big guy, just came by
to take a look at the flowers.

33:29.048 --> 33:32.387
Um, the bank truck is supposed
to be here in a minute.

33:32.422 --> 33:34.515
I got to go get the door.
Oh, that's okay, pal.

33:34.550 --> 33:36.740
We'll make sure
to stay out of your way.

33:54.778 --> 33:57.053
You know, the last thing
you want to do in miami

33:57.088 --> 33:58.988
Is fool with people's
air-conditioning.

34:06.675 --> 34:08.281
Dougie.
Hey, hey, dougie.

34:08.282 --> 34:10.106
You can't be there!
That's where the trucks come in.

34:10.107 --> 34:12.007
No, doug, I just got to
talk to you outside
real quick, all right?

34:31.710 --> 34:32.792
Dougie, come on.

34:32.793 --> 34:34.333
I got to get you
out of here right now.

34:34.333 --> 34:35.907
Dougie,
what the hell's going on?

34:35.908 --> 34:37.181
Dougie,
what the hell are you doing?!

34:37.183 --> 34:39.556
Mr. Lynch, what are you --
dougie, go! Run!

34:43.143 --> 34:45.351
I said get out of here!

35:01.124 --> 35:03.540
Keep going, dougie!

35:05.585 --> 35:08.197
Go on!
Go, go, go!

35:12.729 --> 35:15.082
Get in the car, dougie!

35:15.117 --> 35:17.463
Go!

35:25.711 --> 35:26.597
Hello?

35:26.598 --> 35:27.604
Tyler,
the doors are locked!

35:27.605 --> 35:29.030
You got to get us
out of here now!

35:29.031 --> 35:32.836
Sorry.
Tyler can't talk right now.

35:32.871 --> 35:34.628
But, hey,
the cops are on their way,

35:34.629 --> 35:35.895
And I hope that
they can get in there

35:35.896 --> 35:37.969
Before your oxygen tanks
run out.

35:38.004 --> 35:41.327
[ siren wailing ]
the gas!
Get the masks!

35:42.725 --> 35:44.871
Whoever you are,
you are dead.

35:44.906 --> 35:46.806
Do you hear me?
You are dead!

35:46.838 --> 35:48.738
Good luck.

35:54.564 --> 35:56.487
I don't know how many times
I have to get shot

35:56.522 --> 35:58.305
Before I start
listening to you.

35:58.306 --> 36:00.472
Hopefully,
this one did the trick.

36:01.276 --> 36:03.010
It was for a good cause,
anyway.

36:03.011 --> 36:04.245
Fiona:
Dougie's safe.

36:04.246 --> 36:06.057
Lynch and his crew are
going away for a long time.

36:06.058 --> 36:08.035
Thank you.

36:10.931 --> 36:12.977
When we were kids...

36:13.012 --> 36:15.985
No one was meaner to dougie
than me.

36:16.020 --> 36:18.557
I wouldn't even let him
hang around me.

36:18.592 --> 36:22.515
One day, I-I ran into some
trouble in the neighborhood.

36:22.550 --> 36:24.478
I was getting
my ass kicked.

36:24.513 --> 36:30.218
All of a sudden, here comes
big dougie, backing me up.

36:30.253 --> 36:33.336
I asked him why later.

36:33.371 --> 36:35.598
You know what he said?

36:36.877 --> 36:39.942
"I love you, raymond."

36:41.549 --> 36:44.892
"we're family."

36:48.017 --> 36:51.482
Like it was just
that simple.

37:08.995 --> 37:11.402
A good diversion draws
people's attention.

37:11.437 --> 37:13.808
<i>But doesn't make them run
for their lives.</i>

37:13.843 --> 37:15.656
<i>If you're using
a parked vehicle,</i>

37:15.657 --> 37:17.608
<i>That means
you want smoke and fire</i>

37:17.643 --> 37:19.584
<i>Without the risk
of an explosion.</i>

37:19.619 --> 37:23.358
<i>Olive oil starts to smoke
at 375 degrees.</i>

37:23.393 --> 37:25.798
<i>Mix it in the right amount
of cheap motor oil</i>

37:25.833 --> 37:27.733
<i>With a low flash point...</i>

37:29.091 --> 37:32.304
<i>Apply it to the inside
of the exhaust pipe...</i>

37:38.346 --> 37:40.246
<i>...And you should have
enough time to walk away</i>

37:40.280 --> 37:42.208
<i>Before the fun starts.</i>

37:55.402 --> 37:56.987
If anyone comes
into the alley --

37:56.988 --> 37:58.888
I know,
shoot them several times.

37:58.919 --> 38:01.020
Can we get this over with?
Right.

38:05.383 --> 38:06.359
<i>In free climbing,</i>

38:06.360 --> 38:08.691
<i>The general rule is
always to maintain</i>

38:08.726 --> 38:11.849
<i>At least two points of contact
with the surface.</i>

38:16.850 --> 38:19.067
<i>Challenging climbs
always include a point</i>

38:19.102 --> 38:21.931
<i>Where the only way to continue
is to make a leap</i>

38:21.966 --> 38:25.394
<i>From one point of support
to the next.</i>

38:25.429 --> 38:26.788
<i>For experienced climbers,</i>

38:26.789 --> 38:28.961
<i>It's a routine technique
with minimal risk --</i>

38:28.996 --> 38:32.231
<i>Unless, of course,
the handhold you're jumping to</i>

38:32.266 --> 38:35.351
<i>Is coated
with a silicon-based lubricant.</i>

38:40.866 --> 38:43.850
Come on.
We got to get out of here.

38:47.014 --> 38:50.067
The department needs more people
like you, citizens who care.

38:50.102 --> 38:51.860
One thing I've learned
over the years --

38:51.861 --> 38:54.536
No city can be truly safe
unless the people,

38:54.571 --> 38:56.685
Ordinary men and women,
get involved.

38:56.720 --> 38:59.620
Cops get the credit,
but you're the real heroes.

38:59.655 --> 39:01.419
Well, you should meet
my son michael.

39:01.420 --> 39:03.452
He's always
getting involved.

39:03.487 --> 39:06.479
Maybe someday
you can introduce us.

39:06.514 --> 39:08.769
Oh, he'd enjoy meet--

39:18.044 --> 39:20.276
I thought
you couldn't come.

39:20.311 --> 39:22.303
Yeah. I was able
to break free.

39:24.088 --> 39:25.988
Anybody get hurt?

39:28.532 --> 39:29.993
Is it over now?

39:29.994 --> 39:31.934
Not yet.

39:35.063 --> 39:37.402
You know what?

39:37.437 --> 39:39.387
Let's get you out of here.

39:39.422 --> 39:41.114
What about your award, ma?

39:41.115 --> 39:43.221
Oh, they can mail it to me.

39:46.193 --> 39:49.322
You can take your tie off
now, michael. Thank you.

39:53.195 --> 39:55.642
Glad you could make lunch
after such a busy morning.

39:58.314 --> 40:00.990
I heard drinking whiskey before
dinner was a sign of weakness.

40:01.025 --> 40:04.205
Indulge me,
out of respect for claude.

40:04.240 --> 40:06.319
Dalmore was his favorite.

40:06.354 --> 40:07.869
<i>Was his favorite?</i>

40:07.870 --> 40:10.946
Unfortunately, our comrade
didn't survive his injuries.

40:10.981 --> 40:12.491
He broke his ankle.

40:12.492 --> 40:13.957
There were complications.

40:13.958 --> 40:16.021
Luckily,
we still have each other.

40:16.056 --> 40:19.270
You wanted to work alone?
Bully.

40:19.305 --> 40:21.013
The acquisition
of those documents

40:21.014 --> 40:23.362
Is now solely
your responsibility.

40:25.835 --> 40:28.380
You know,
I feel like we've moved on

40:28.415 --> 40:30.921
To a new level of trust.

40:30.956 --> 40:32.480
Maybe now you can tell me

40:32.481 --> 40:34.187
Where this relationship
is headed.

40:34.188 --> 40:36.001
If claude's failure
teaches us anything,

40:36.002 --> 40:37.902
It's that we must live
in the moment.

40:37.915 --> 40:41.885
I suggest you honor his memory
by completing his mission.

40:42.685 --> 40:43.886
Consider it...

40:43.887 --> 40:48.058
A reason for living,
as it were.

40:51.307 --> 40:53.869
To claude.

40:54.994 --> 40:57.517
And to living.
