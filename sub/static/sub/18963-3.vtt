she misses me,

inconsiderate of her

05:56.557 --> 05:57.925
to even expect me to.

05:57.991 --> 06:00.461
I mean, she's the one

06:00.528 --> 06:02.963
I rewrite my novel
before she'll marry me.

06:03.030 --> 06:04.097
Which you've done.

06:21.515 --> 06:24.317
why not send her a note?

how I feel, Townsend.

06:26.787 --> 06:29.823
- In my experience...

07:54.842 --> 07:57.945
I worry that I'll never do
anything of import,

07:58.011 --> 07:59.446
for I'm much too lazy to care

07:59.547 --> 08:02.983
whether a thing is done or not.

08:03.050 --> 08:07.020
All I truly want
is to be young always,

my life is my own.

Tildy says the people
of New York

08:15.729 --> 08:18.031
all have different
kind of accents.

08:18.098 --> 08:19.833
The likes of which
she's never heard.

08:19.900 --> 08:21.969
Plenty of different accents
around here.

08:22.035 --> 08:23.671
You mean, like,
Mississippi and Georgia?

08:23.737 --> 08:26.106
They are different.

08:26.173 --> 08:27.407
Are they not?

08:27.474 --> 08:28.575
I think Tildy's talkin' about

08:28.576 --> 08:30.043
non-southern type
accents, Daddy.

08:30.110 --> 08:32.712
Yes, Tootsie, I understand.

08:32.780 --> 08:35.916
- We about done here?
- Zelda, honey.

08:35.982 --> 08:38.585
Could you post this for me?

08:38.586 --> 08:39.620
I suppose so.

08:39.687 --> 08:41.020
The streets are
filled to the brim

08:41.087 --> 08:43.490
with people and cars
and buses and trolleys.

08:43.591 --> 08:44.858
It's all one big swirl.

08:44.925 --> 08:46.593
Nothin' to love
about the big city.

08:46.594 --> 08:48.061
I think it sounds exciting.

08:48.128 --> 08:49.997
Yet you passed on your chance.

08:52.600 --> 08:54.735
Which is to our good fortune.

08:54.802 --> 08:56.604
Still havin' you here with us.

08:56.637 --> 08:58.639
So happy to
keep you happy, Daddy.

08:58.706 --> 09:00.607
Livy and Ellie are
waitin' on me.

09:00.608 --> 09:02.710
We're goin' to
the suffragette rally
this afternoon.

09:02.776 --> 09:04.111
Do you want to come, Tootsie?

09:04.177 --> 09:06.113
I promised Abigail I'd
baby sit little Camden.

09:06.179 --> 09:08.616
What about Annie Laurie's
tea dance, Zelda?

09:08.649 --> 09:09.783
Isn't that today?

09:09.850 --> 09:11.885
Those affairs are insufferable.

09:11.952 --> 09:15.656
More so than the
"insufferablegette" rally?

09:15.723 --> 09:17.090
I find it gratifying that

09:17.157 --> 09:19.660
Zelda has so many activities
to choose from.

09:19.727 --> 09:24.264
Well, I'm off to march,
wave signs and shout slogans

09:24.331 --> 09:25.799
that would curl your hair.

09:26.934 --> 09:29.970
Nothing to love about
women voting.

09:35.175 --> 09:36.644
Sorry I'm late.

09:37.978 --> 09:40.113
Your family takes forever
to eat lunch.

09:40.180 --> 09:42.082
- Livy.
- Well, she's right,
Ellie, they do.

09:42.149 --> 09:44.284
I thought you changed your mind.

09:44.351 --> 09:46.119
I wouldn't miss this.
It's historic,

09:46.186 --> 09:48.188
and happening right here
in little old Montgomery.

09:48.255 --> 09:50.123
Not to mention
it's something
to write about

09:50.190 --> 09:53.026
in your next letter to
Mr. Scott Fitzgerald.

09:53.093 --> 09:56.663
Dearest Scott,
the rally was
ever so amazing.

09:56.664 --> 09:58.398
Why do you keep
writing him, anyway?

09:58.465 --> 10:00.376
Well,
just because I told him
I wasn't gonna marry him

10:00.400 --> 10:02.235
doesn't mean I can't
correspond, does it?

10:09.843 --> 10:13.446
- Come on, Zelda.
- Whatever is the matter now?

10:13.513 --> 10:15.215
I'm comin', I'm comin'.

10:15.282 --> 10:18.018

10:57.490 --> 10:58.501
Depends on which magazines.

10:58.525 --> 10:59.893
And how much lead time.

10:59.960 --> 11:01.728
Time, Life, Redbook.

11:01.729 --> 11:03.063
National editions or regional?

11:03.130 --> 11:04.732
What do they have to do
with teeth?

11:04.798 --> 11:06.299
- He speaks.
- Excuse me?

11:06.366 --> 11:08.836
What do Chesterfields
have to do with teeth?

11:08.902 --> 11:10.570
Dentists recommend them.

11:10.637 --> 11:12.105
For what, stains?

11:12.172 --> 11:14.050
This is our first major shot
at the cigarette market.

11:14.074 --> 11:16.076
Do you have any idea
how big this is gonna be?

11:16.143 --> 11:20.247
Oh, this big?
[sighs]

11:20.313 --> 11:22.115
Mr. Little,

11:22.182 --> 11:25.252
people buy cigarettes
for their taste,

11:25.318 --> 11:27.620
for the quality of the tobacco,

11:27.755 --> 11:29.923
not for their teeth.

11:29.990 --> 11:31.792
We've got dentists.

11:31.859 --> 11:33.861
So, we have to get people
to buy Chesterfields

11:33.927 --> 11:35.796
because dentists recommend them.

11:35.863 --> 11:37.140
Makes your food
taste even better.

11:37.164 --> 11:38.899
The brandy's
never been smoother.

11:38.966 --> 11:40.233
Helps settle the stomach.

11:40.300 --> 11:42.870
Doesn't sound
very "dentisty."

11:42.936 --> 11:47.307
And what does sound
"dentisty" to you,
Mr. Fitzgerald?

11:50.778 --> 11:51.979
Mr. Fitzgerald?

11:54.181 --> 11:56.683
This is...
This is absurd.

11:56.784 --> 11:58.451
This is the...

11:58.518 --> 11:59.619
Can't do this anymore.

11:59.686 --> 12:00.921
Now, look here, Fitzgerald...

12:00.988 --> 12:03.156
No. Mr. Little,
allow me,

12:03.223 --> 12:06.827
for I believe
this is the moment
in the meeting

12:06.894 --> 12:08.796
wherein I quit.

12:08.829 --> 12:10.597
What?

12:10.663 --> 12:12.866
And lose dentists.

12:12.933 --> 12:14.334
Go with the singular.

12:14.401 --> 12:17.504
"At the end of a long day
serving others,

12:17.570 --> 12:23.610
"this dentist

12:23.676 --> 12:25.879
"It's all the service
he needs."

12:27.480 --> 12:28.949
Write that down.

12:29.016 --> 12:30.984
- Write that down.
- Okay.

12:33.987 --> 12:36.289
I've spent today
in the graveyard,

12:36.356 --> 12:40.961
all washed and covered with
weepy, watery blue flowers.

12:41.028 --> 12:43.496
I'll just say,
but all the broken columns

12:43.563 --> 12:47.367
and clasped hands
and doves and angels

12:47.434 --> 12:49.102

12:51.004 --> 12:52.973
Out of a row of
Confederate soldiers,

12:53.040 --> 12:55.909
two or three will
make you think of
dead lovers.

12:55.976 --> 12:57.878
They're exactly like the others,

12:57.945 --> 13:00.013
even to the yellowish moss.

13:01.314 --> 13:03.683
Oh, death is so beautiful.

13:03.750 --> 13:06.753
So very beautiful.

13:06.854 --> 13:09.522
We will die together.
I know.

13:18.365 --> 13:20.200
Out of a row of
Confederated soldiers...

13:20.267 --> 13:22.870
Oh, death is so beautiful.

13:22.903 --> 13:24.137
So very beautiful.

13:24.204 --> 13:25.572
So you see, dearest Scott...

13:25.638 --> 13:27.540
I've spent today
in the graveyard.

13:27.607 --> 13:31.011
[words overlapping]

13:31.078 --> 13:32.913
...is to be young always.

13:35.215 --> 13:38.185
We will die together.
I know.

13:38.251 --> 13:40.087
I only stopped by to say hey

13:40.153 --> 13:43.490
when Roger has to suddenly
go out back

13:43.556 --> 13:44.591
and check his bait tanks.

13:44.657 --> 13:46.326
So then this
Miss Elvina comes in,

13:46.393 --> 13:47.603
she must have been
100 years old,

13:47.627 --> 13:49.129
and I tell her, I say,

13:49.196 --> 13:51.498
"Roger's just
a friend of my family's
in cotton,"

13:51.564 --> 13:54.434
but she won't hear of it,
she just wants to talk fish.

14:03.977 --> 14:05.812
Oh. Did she get
what she wanted?

14:05.913 --> 14:07.147
I hope so.

14:07.214 --> 14:09.549
I beat it out of there
the minute Roger got back.

14:11.985 --> 14:14.554
I'm sorry.
Sometimes I...

14:14.621 --> 14:16.523
I get goin' on a story.

14:16.589 --> 14:18.325
Not at all, John.

14:18.391 --> 14:19.292
I like it.

14:19.359 --> 14:21.929
It speaks to your
general enthusiasm.

14:21.995 --> 14:23.596
Well, I do have that.

14:26.934 --> 14:28.401
I have something else.

14:40.513 --> 14:41.614
My pin.

14:44.751 --> 14:46.586
You know what this means, right?

14:46.653 --> 14:48.188
I surely do.

15:04.104 --> 15:05.972
Where is everybody, Mama?

15:05.973 --> 15:07.607
I'm here.

15:07.674 --> 15:08.841
I mean Daddy.

15:08.976 --> 15:10.710
Rotary Club.

15:10.777 --> 15:12.179
All right, then.

15:12.245 --> 15:16.616
Well, Zelda, baby,
how is everything?

15:16.683 --> 15:17.683
What?

15:17.717 --> 15:19.252
Just, you know,

15:19.319 --> 15:21.421
wondering how everything is?

15:22.990 --> 15:26.426
You are so bad at
fakin' things, Mama.

15:26.493 --> 15:28.828
You know, don't you?
Well, I know you know.

15:28.895 --> 15:32.765
Now, I may have run across
Mrs. Sellers at the grocery
today.

15:32.832 --> 15:34.334
And she just may have
mentioned that

15:34.401 --> 15:36.736
John was gonna give me
his pin tonight?

15:36.803 --> 15:38.105
Possibly.

15:40.373 --> 15:43.643
I have lots of pins
from lots of boys, Mama.

15:43.710 --> 15:45.212
I know, Zelda dear.

15:45.278 --> 15:47.847
I've been followin' along
lo these many years,

15:47.914 --> 15:53.153
but somehow
this one's different,
isn't it, baby?

15:53.220 --> 15:56.689
How do you know when
it's different, Mama?

15:56.756 --> 15:58.658
I don't know.

15:58.725 --> 16:00.227
What kind of answer is that?

16:00.293 --> 16:03.496
What kind of answer
did you want?

16:03.563 --> 16:06.299
Well, he cares about you
a great deal.

16:06.366 --> 16:08.668
Anyone can see that and...

16:08.735 --> 16:12.339
You know, he'll certainly
be able to care for you.

16:12.405 --> 16:14.041
Those are not
unimportant things.

16:14.107 --> 16:16.043
I know that.

16:16.109 --> 16:18.945
You and Daddy
never think I do,
but I do.

16:19.046 --> 16:21.548
It's what
worried everyone so
about Scott.

16:24.684 --> 16:27.287
But, Mama...

16:27.354 --> 16:29.256
you weren't happy
marryin' Daddy.

16:29.322 --> 16:31.058
Oh, come now, Zelda.

16:31.091 --> 16:34.127
I know there were
other possibilities.

16:34.194 --> 16:35.562
Were you in love
with any of them?

16:37.064 --> 16:39.166
You can find
something to love
about every man

16:39.232 --> 16:41.068
if you put your mind to it.

16:41.134 --> 16:43.070
I don't want to
have to put my mind to it.

16:43.103 --> 16:45.705
But you will, baby.

16:45.772 --> 16:47.540
Whether you want to or not.

16:51.544 --> 16:54.747
I'm just gonna run
this laundry downstairs.

16:54.814 --> 16:55.948
I can do that, Mama.

16:56.083 --> 16:58.351
Oh, of course.
Thank you, dear.

18:45.525 --> 18:48.961
So, I've given it a read.

18:49.028 --> 18:50.230
It's longer.

18:52.098 --> 18:54.267
And quite different.

19:06.913 --> 19:10.817
Don't forget your hat
this time, Mr. Fitzgerald.

19:13.820 --> 19:15.522

didn't you used to have
a crush on Stuart Ramsey?

22:01.187 --> 22:02.187
Maybe when I was eight.

22:02.221 --> 22:03.623
He might be interesting now.
