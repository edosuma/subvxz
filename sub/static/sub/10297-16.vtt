Just the girls!

01:52.400 --> 01:55.267
Food! Food! Food!
Food! Food! Food!

01:57.534 --> 02:00.234
Oh, well, that was fun.

02:00.234 --> 02:01.367
But nobody's bringing any.

02:01.367 --> 02:04.601
So you guys
want to see my new dress?

02:04.601 --> 02:05.801
Uh, yeah, sure thing, Mom,

02:05.801 --> 02:07.801
but first, can we have
a little chat about nutrition.

02:07.801 --> 02:11.100
To hell with nutrition,
let's talk about food.

02:12.067 --> 02:13.601
You see, Mom,

02:13.601 --> 02:15.634
no nutrition
equals no brain.

02:15.634 --> 02:17.868
I give you
exhibit A.

02:19.701 --> 02:20.701
Now, we've
been talking

02:20.701 --> 02:21.901
to the other
kids at school,

02:21.901 --> 02:24.100
and they get
three meals a day.

02:24.100 --> 02:25.434
Now, I know
what you said,

02:25.434 --> 02:27.467
that food only
leads to food poisoning,

02:27.467 --> 02:29.434
but we're willing
to risk it.

02:29.434 --> 02:33.400
Oh, kids, don't you understand?

02:33.400 --> 02:35.267
See, your father
doesn't earn enough

02:35.267 --> 02:39.267
for this dress and food.

02:39.267 --> 02:40.901
Frankly, your father
doesn't earn enough

02:40.901 --> 02:44.267
for this dress and gum.

02:44.267 --> 02:46.133
Actually, your father
doesn't earn enough

02:46.133 --> 02:48.167
for this dress.

02:48.167 --> 02:49.667
So if you're really hungry,

02:49.667 --> 02:52.000
why don't you
eat this price tag?

02:52.000 --> 02:57.033
And eat it fast
before your dad gets home.

02:57.033 --> 02:58.067
Hey, how come

02:58.067 --> 03:00.767
you always get
the plastic thread?

03:00.767 --> 03:02.234
I'm just doing it
for you, Kelly.

03:02.234 --> 03:04.868
You know plastic goes
right to your thighs.

03:06.901 --> 03:09.000
Come on, Mom.
We're hungry.

03:09.000 --> 03:11.534
Isn't there anything
to eat in this house?

03:24.834 --> 03:25.834
You know,

03:25.834 --> 03:27.501
I don't think he ever got over

03:27.501 --> 03:29.534
waking up
that Christmas morning,

03:29.534 --> 03:30.834
surrounded by little potatoes

03:30.834 --> 03:34.734
with a pineapple ring
on his back.

03:34.734 --> 03:38.100
It's not like we glazed him
or anything.

03:38.100 --> 03:40.033
Mom, we're starving.

03:40.033 --> 03:42.334
Feed us or trade us.

03:42.334 --> 03:45.868
Kids, I really do
know how you feel.

03:45.868 --> 03:47.234
I was hungry too,

03:47.234 --> 03:52.133
until I stopped at Burger King
on my way home.

03:52.133 --> 03:53.901
But, you see,
this is real important.

03:53.901 --> 03:56.667
Daddy and I are going
to our high school reunion,

03:56.667 --> 03:58.734
and I really want to wow them.

03:58.734 --> 04:00.200
If you really want
to wow them,

04:00.200 --> 04:01.501
why don't you just tell them

04:01.501 --> 04:03.667
that your daughter
weighs 47 pounds?

04:03.667 --> 04:07.100
Boy, Mommy just wants
to have a little fun,

04:07.100 --> 04:10.634
and all you kids can think about
are your empty little stomachs.

04:10.634 --> 04:12.334
Now, go forage in the freezer,

04:12.334 --> 04:14.367
and let Mommy be happy.

04:24.000 --> 04:26.267
Hi, Peg.

04:26.267 --> 04:27.634
Nice dress.

04:27.634 --> 04:28.901
What's the occasion?

04:28.901 --> 04:31.934
Oprah having
a formal episode?

04:31.934 --> 04:33.100
Al,

04:33.100 --> 04:34.934
don't you remember anything?

04:34.934 --> 04:37.868
Not since I said, "I do."

04:40.834 --> 04:42.033
Then your mother
opened her mouth

04:42.033 --> 04:44.267
and put me down.

04:44.267 --> 04:46.667
That was a show of affection.

04:46.667 --> 04:49.634
That's how she used to
carry all of us around.

04:49.634 --> 04:51.167
But let's forget about the past.

04:51.167 --> 04:54.133
Tomorrow night, we're going
to our high school reunion,

04:54.133 --> 04:55.534
and I want us to look nice,

04:55.534 --> 04:57.601
so get your suit
out of the hamper and iron it.

05:03.133 --> 05:05.334
Peg, I don't want to go
to my high school reunion.

05:05.334 --> 05:06.534
I just know they're going to

05:06.534 --> 05:07.934
ask me questions
that I can't answer,

05:07.934 --> 05:09.400
like, "How you doing?"

05:11.167 --> 05:13.334
"How's it going?"

05:13.334 --> 05:15.901
And the ever-painful
"How they hanging?"

05:20.467 --> 05:22.234
Now, listen, Al,
you promised you'd take me

05:22.234 --> 05:25.801
the night you didn't take me
to our senior prom.

05:25.801 --> 05:27.067
Well, honey,

05:27.067 --> 05:28.868
we had a great time
that night, didn't we?

05:28.868 --> 05:31.501
Oh, yeah,
wall-to-wall magic.

05:31.501 --> 05:34.968
Watching sports on TV
at my father's house.

05:34.968 --> 05:36.601
You drank all the beer.

05:36.601 --> 05:38.000
I said, "I love you."

05:38.000 --> 05:41.767
You said, "Shut up,
I can't hear the game."

05:41.767 --> 05:45.767
Oh, and then we did it
on my father's coat.

05:45.767 --> 05:48.334
You were quite
a tiger that night, Al.

05:48.334 --> 05:49.767
Yeah, well,
who ever thought

05:49.767 --> 05:52.901
I'd see you again
after that?

06:02.000 --> 06:04.434
Hey, Kel, I think
I got something here.

06:04.434 --> 06:06.467
It could be edible.

06:06.467 --> 06:08.100
Let's see. It's...

06:08.100 --> 06:10.901
It's...

06:10.901 --> 06:13.834
Freddy, my goldfish?

06:13.834 --> 06:15.868
It's the one we froze
till they found a cure

06:15.868 --> 06:18.434
for whatever
was killing him.

06:18.434 --> 06:19.934
Bud, you were
only 5 then,

06:19.934 --> 06:20.934
so we didn't tell you,

06:20.934 --> 06:21.934
but, um,

06:21.934 --> 06:23.367
what was killing him

06:23.367 --> 06:25.000
was that
we didn't feed him.

06:28.367 --> 06:30.968
Oh, Freddy.

06:30.968 --> 06:32.834
Dibs on the head.

06:32.834 --> 06:34.701
I get the head.

06:34.701 --> 06:36.100
No, he was my pet.

06:36.100 --> 06:39.334
Yeah, well, I was the one
who didn't feed him.

06:39.334 --> 06:40.801
Oops.

06:40.801 --> 06:42.000
Well, let's just fry him up,

06:42.000 --> 06:43.801
and we'll say
next time I get a pet,

06:43.801 --> 06:45.200
you can let him
starve to death.

06:45.200 --> 06:46.067
Deal.

06:48.000 --> 06:48.868
Ahh.

06:51.868 --> 06:54.133
Kel, I can't.

06:54.133 --> 06:56.667
I mean, I just can't
eat Freddy.

06:56.667 --> 06:59.267
He lived in my room.

06:59.267 --> 07:00.300
So does fungus.

07:00.300 --> 07:03.167
Where do you
draw the line?

07:03.167 --> 07:05.667
At a fish I was proud
to call my friend.

07:05.667 --> 07:07.000
Hey,

07:07.000 --> 07:09.400
let's go outside and throw him
in front of a car.

07:09.400 --> 07:12.000
Maybe we can get
some insurance money.

07:12.000 --> 07:12.868
Oh, cool.

07:14.734 --> 07:15.734
I'm glad they're gone.

07:15.734 --> 07:19.367
They were
depressing me, Al.

07:19.367 --> 07:20.901
So, honey,
there is no way

07:20.901 --> 07:22.901
you're not taking me
to this reunion.

07:22.901 --> 07:24.100
This year,

07:24.100 --> 07:26.033
they're going to elect
a queen for the reunion.

07:26.033 --> 07:28.234
Now, I gave up being
queen of our prom for you.

07:28.234 --> 07:29.300
Don't you think

07:29.300 --> 07:30.901
it's time you gave up
something for me?

07:30.901 --> 07:32.934
Well, I guess
a little thing like my life

07:32.934 --> 07:34.334
is meaningless, huh?

07:34.334 --> 07:37.000
Oh, honey,
I never wanted your life.

07:37.000 --> 07:40.033
I just took it
because it was there.

07:40.033 --> 07:42.434
But being reunion queen
is important to me,

07:42.434 --> 07:44.267
and I just know I can win.

07:44.267 --> 07:46.467
The only competition
I have to worry about

07:46.467 --> 07:48.033
is that Connie Bender.

07:48.033 --> 07:50.767
Yeah, Connie Bender.

07:50.767 --> 07:53.968
I remember her.

07:53.968 --> 07:56.467
What do you remember, Al?

07:56.467 --> 07:59.868
I remember her father
had a great coat.

08:01.868 --> 08:05.501
I know what you're trying to do.

08:05.501 --> 08:07.300
You're trying
to make me mad at you

08:07.300 --> 08:09.200
so I'll tell you to stay home.

08:09.200 --> 08:10.901
Well, it didn't work
at our wedding,

08:10.901 --> 08:12.834
and it's not gonna work now.

08:16.067 --> 08:18.300
You know,
it's amazing.

08:18.300 --> 08:20.033
A million cars
on the road,

08:20.033 --> 08:21.234
and you toss Freddy

08:21.234 --> 08:23.000
in front of
an uninsured motorist.

08:23.000 --> 08:24.734
Well, Kelly,

08:24.734 --> 08:27.133
if you'd just gotten in the car
like the man asked,

08:27.133 --> 08:29.834
we would have had 50 bucks.

08:34.333 --> 08:36.801
Well, let's just go upstairs
and check the webs for spiders.

08:36.801 --> 08:39.467
Yeah, well, just don't give me
any of that,

08:39.467 --> 08:41.167
"Don't eat him, it's Stanley,"

08:41.167 --> 08:44.000
because if it moves,
it's dinner.

08:44.000 --> 08:45.267
Well, it's obvious

08:45.267 --> 08:46.968
the kids have
upstairs covered.

08:46.968 --> 08:48.300
What's my dinner, Peg?

08:48.300 --> 08:51.734

du jour?

burst into our house

08:58.934 --> 09:00.834
and then hid under our bed.

09:00.834 --> 09:03.334
He does that every day
around suppertime.

09:03.334 --> 09:05.367
Quite frankly,
he needs a bath,

09:05.367 --> 09:07.501
and he won't listen
to a word I say.

09:11.934 --> 09:14.267
Oh, that is such
a beautiful dress.

09:14.267 --> 09:17.501
I just saw it
on Michigan Avenue,

09:17.501 --> 09:19.667
but my husband didn't
think we could afford it.

09:19.667 --> 09:21.267
See, Steve?

09:21.267 --> 09:26.033
Al doesn't mind spending
$500 on his wife.

09:33.100 --> 09:36.801
Is that what I spent on you,
pookie?

09:36.801 --> 09:39.501
Gee, I guess
I really do love you.

09:39.501 --> 09:41.067
We're broke. You know that, Peg.

09:41.067 --> 09:42.067
Oh, Al.

09:42.067 --> 09:43.767
What difference does it make,

09:43.767 --> 09:45.734
another month
in debtor's prison?

I'm going
to be reunion queen!

09:47.367 --> 09:48.367
[GASPS]

09:48.367 --> 09:50.667
That's so exciting.

09:50.667 --> 09:52.167
But if you're
going to be queen,

09:52.167 --> 09:54.367
you can't just go
in a $500 dress.

09:54.367 --> 09:57.734
You have to
accessorize properly.

09:57.734 --> 09:58.834
We could get you

09:58.834 --> 10:00.968
a beautiful
beaded evening purse

10:00.968 --> 10:02.000
if you'd be willing

10:02.000 --> 10:05.100
to bounce a check
for another $200.

10:05.100 --> 10:07.834
Would you mind, honey?

10:07.834 --> 10:09.501
So, Al,

10:09.501 --> 10:11.033
what are you up for,

10:11.033 --> 10:14.133
the coveted "Cartwheeling
to the Grave" award?

10:14.133 --> 10:15.133
Okay, everybody,

10:15.133 --> 10:17.534
let me put this
as plainly as I can.

10:17.534 --> 10:19.634
I rule this house.

10:19.634 --> 10:20.634
I pay for it.

10:20.634 --> 10:22.968
I rot within its walls,

10:22.968 --> 10:24.501
and I make the decisions.

10:24.501 --> 10:25.934
And my decision is,

10:25.934 --> 10:28.267
save that dress
for my funeral,

10:28.267 --> 10:31.167
because we're not,
no chance, no way, no how,

10:31.167 --> 10:32.234
going to that reunion.

10:34.701 --> 10:36.701
And you're going
to have to buy some shoes.

10:39.734 --> 10:40.934
Oh, Peggy. Queen!

10:40.934 --> 10:43.033
I'm so happy for you.

10:43.033 --> 10:48.567
So, what will
you be wearing, Al?

10:48.567 --> 10:50.501
The royal leash?

10:56.767 --> 10:59.667
I don't understand.

10:59.667 --> 11:02.634
I mean, the father's the boss,
isn't he?

11:02.634 --> 11:05.067
I mean, Robert Young
was the boss.

11:05.067 --> 11:07.834
Fred MacMurray got some respect.

11:07.834 --> 11:10.434
Even Fred Flintstone
had his day once or twice.

11:12.067 --> 11:13.267
Are you telling me

11:13.267 --> 11:15.367
I'm not the man
Fred Flintstone is?

11:15.367 --> 11:18.234
Well, he had a better
job than you do.

11:20.033 --> 11:22.901
Oh, come on, Al.

11:22.901 --> 11:24.901
Reunions are fun.

11:24.901 --> 11:25.968
Every now and then,

11:25.968 --> 11:28.267
you have to take
a stroll down memory lane

11:28.267 --> 11:30.767
and say hi
to Mr. Days Gone By.

11:30.767 --> 11:32.000
Why, Steve and I

11:32.000 --> 11:34.734
couldn't wait to go
to our respective reunions.

11:34.734 --> 11:36.434
The failures
of our former classmates

11:36.434 --> 11:40.400
were even greater
than we'd hoped and dreamed.

11:40.400 --> 11:44.934
Yeah, remember that hotshot
visual-aids captain,

11:44.934 --> 11:46.534
Marcus Belsky?

11:46.534 --> 11:48.601
He's a tow truck
operator now.

11:50.367 --> 11:53.834
Yeah.
Steal my compass, will you?

11:53.834 --> 11:56.367
Well, rot in hell, Belsky.

11:56.367 --> 11:58.868
What about that
snot-nosed pompom slut,

11:58.868 --> 12:01.434
Courtney Pierce?

12:01.434 --> 12:03.734
"Most Likely
to Succeed."

12:03.734 --> 12:07.934
Yeah, well, she succeeded
in growing a mustache...

12:07.934 --> 12:11.200
and bagging groceries
for $3.20 an hour.

12:11.200 --> 12:13.934
Yeah, see? That's what
reunions are for.

12:13.934 --> 12:17.000
To laugh and point
at the pitiful.

12:17.000 --> 12:18.901
You know, Al, the wretches,
the failures,

12:18.901 --> 12:20.501
The people who haven't
accomplished a damn thing

12:20.501 --> 12:21.367
since high school.

12:27.968 --> 12:29.701
I, uh...

12:29.701 --> 12:32.400
Uh, I'm sorry, Al.

12:32.400 --> 12:37.033
You know,
Barney Rubble wasn't much,

12:37.033 --> 12:39.667
but at least he was supportive,
Steve.

12:42.167 --> 12:43.801
Marcie,
let's go home,

12:43.801 --> 12:45.033

12:45.033 --> 12:47.367
some of our old classmates'
credit ratings

12:47.367 --> 12:49.067
on the computer,

12:49.067 --> 12:50.234
and make love

12:50.234 --> 12:51.868
by the flickering ashes
of their lives.

12:51.868 --> 12:54.234
Steve.

12:54.234 --> 12:57.167
We'll make a bed
of our negotiable securities...

12:57.167 --> 12:58.767
and do the wild thing.

13:02.634 --> 13:03.634
Why don't we get

13:03.634 --> 13:06.634
any negotiable
securities, Al?

13:06.634 --> 13:11.434
Because my wild thing
broke me.

13:11.434 --> 13:12.968
Now, get this 
straight, Peg.

13:12.968 --> 13:15.267
There's is no way I'm going
to this reunion.

13:15.267 --> 13:17.367
Listen, Al,

13:17.367 --> 13:19.734
You said, "I'm not
taking you to the prom."

13:19.734 --> 13:20.934
I said, "Fine."

13:20.934 --> 13:21.934
You said,

13:21.934 --> 13:23.133
"I'll only be
a shoes salesman

13:23.133 --> 13:24.167
"for a couple of months

13:24.167 --> 13:25.767
till I get my feet
off the ground."

13:25.767 --> 13:27.167
I said, "Fine."

13:27.167 --> 13:28.601
You said,

13:28.601 --> 13:30.701
"I don't know what's
wrong. I'm just tired."

13:30.701 --> 13:33.000
I said, "Fine."

13:33.000 --> 13:35.100
I'm not saying
"fine" anymore.

13:35.100 --> 13:36.601
We are going
to this reunion,

13:36.601 --> 13:38.033
and you're gonna
be proud of me,

13:38.033 --> 13:40.334
and I am gonna
be proud of you,

13:40.334 --> 13:42.567
because when people ask
what you do for a living,

13:42.567 --> 13:46.167
you're going to say
you're a garbage man.

13:46.167 --> 13:48.667
Peg, I don't want
to go to the reunion.

13:48.667 --> 13:50.267
Can't we just forget
about the good times

13:50.267 --> 13:51.334
and get on with our lives?

13:52.968 --> 13:54.734
No, Al.

hunky bear.

14:00.868 --> 14:02.133
Peg, don't
do this to me.

14:02.133 --> 14:04.367
You know it shrivels up
all my working parts.

14:07.467 --> 14:10.067

hairy tummy,

14:10.067 --> 14:15.000

14:15.000 --> 14:16.434
Please.

14:16.434 --> 14:17.567
Oh, honey,

14:17.567 --> 14:19.767
I'll be a good girl
for the rest of my life.

14:19.767 --> 14:21.234
I promise,

14:21.234 --> 14:23.901
and I'll never ask you
for anything ever, ever again.

Okay, donkey-wonkey?

14:25.634 --> 14:27.734
Oh, jeez,
I'll do anything.

14:27.734 --> 14:30.200
Just shut up,
all right?

14:30.200 --> 14:33.567
Fine, but now that
you insist on going,

14:33.567 --> 14:35.367
there are going
to be a few rules.

14:35.367 --> 14:36.834
First, I don't
want you talking

14:36.834 --> 14:38.734
to any
of your old friends,

14:38.734 --> 14:41.534
particularly
that little weasel, Eli.

14:41.534 --> 14:43.701
Hey, Eli was
a good guy, Peg.

14:43.701 --> 14:45.567
Good guys don't say,

14:45.567 --> 14:48.133
"Hey, Bundy,
I got 20 riding on you.

14:48.133 --> 14:50.701
Lower your head
and run into a brick wall."

14:50.701 --> 14:51.834
[CHUCKLES]

14:51.834 --> 14:54.234
No one had ever
done that before.

14:58.200 --> 15:00.701
You know,
I like to think if you hadn't,

15:00.701 --> 15:03.834
you might actually
have been a garbage man.

15:03.834 --> 15:05.400
Rule number two,

15:05.400 --> 15:07.400
I don't want you
getting into any fights,

15:07.400 --> 15:08.934
particularly with Jack.

15:10.868 --> 15:12.267
Jack.

15:12.267 --> 15:14.767
Yeah. I remember Jack.

15:14.767 --> 15:16.868
I don't like Jack.

15:16.868 --> 15:19.000
He had this thing
about being the best.

15:19.000 --> 15:22.834
Always trying to top me.

15:22.834 --> 15:24.868
I'd make the team,
he'd make the team.

15:24.868 --> 15:26.901
I set a record, he set a record.

15:26.901 --> 15:27.901
He passed a gallstone,

15:27.901 --> 15:29.868
I married you.

15:31.801 --> 15:34.334
We could never settle that tie.

15:34.334 --> 15:36.701
Jack and me split the school
right down the middle.

15:36.701 --> 15:39.334
Half for him, half for me.

15:39.334 --> 15:40.601
On graduation day,

15:40.601 --> 15:42.601
we were going to fight it out
in the schoolyard,

15:42.601 --> 15:44.701
me and him,
till one of us dropped.

15:44.701 --> 15:47.701
Well, then, something happened.

15:47.701 --> 15:50.033
Yeah, I think
that something was Eli

15:50.033 --> 15:53.901
betting you couldn't
jump over a Mustang going 50.

15:53.901 --> 15:57.601
I was 2 inches
short of that, Peg.

15:57.601 --> 15:59.868
If my toe had just
cleared that driver's nose,

15:59.868 --> 16:02.234
I'd have won
that $10 bet,

16:02.234 --> 16:04.100
and my fight with Jack,

16:04.100 --> 16:06.000
and played college ball,

16:06.000 --> 16:08.000
and married a debutante,

rich and famous.

16:11.100 --> 16:12.367

worked out just fine,

By the way, Sumo,
who will you be voting for?

21:47.200 --> 21:50.133
She who holds our passport.

21:55.000 --> 21:57.000
Tough luck, Wanker.

21:57.000 --> 21:58.968
Now, look here, Bender.

21:58.968 --> 22:01.801
I didn't spend $500
on this dress,

22:01.801 --> 22:03.234
$2000 in phone calls,

22:03.234 --> 22:06.601
and $300 for these shoes

22:06.601 --> 22:08.033
to go home with this.

22:09.300 --> 22:10.534
I swear

22:10.534 --> 22:14.200
by the hairs
on your chinny-chin-chin,

22:14.200 --> 22:17.067
I will be queen of this reunion.

22:17.067 --> 22:19.734
Not when you're one vote short,
baby.

22:39.501 --> 22:41.367
[***]

22:42.305 --> 22:48.838
