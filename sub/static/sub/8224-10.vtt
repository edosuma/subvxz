Narrator:
On this episode of "MythBusters"...

00:03.589 --> 00:05.557
[ tires screech ]
...we get behind the wheel...

00:05.558 --> 00:06.992
[ indistinct shouting ]

00:06.993 --> 00:09.127
...ride the rails...

00:09.128 --> 00:10.996
...and take flight...

00:10.997 --> 00:12.898
Whoo! Ho, ho! Ho, ho!

00:12.899 --> 00:15.167
- ...as we go behind the scenes...
Adam: - Jamie!

00:15.168 --> 00:16.902
...get the inside story...

00:16.903 --> 00:19.604
He for some reason
forgot to turn off the key.

00:19.605 --> 00:21.706
Tory: You're sitting there watching it.

00:21.707 --> 00:22.874
Your mind cannot process it.

00:22.875 --> 00:25.477
Narrator: ...and count down the top 12

00:25.478 --> 00:27.779
plane, train, and automobile moments.

00:28.915 --> 00:31.750
That was definitely the
strangest thing I had ever done

00:31.751 --> 00:33.218
in my life up till that point.

00:33.219 --> 00:34.753
[ chuckles ]

00:34.754 --> 00:37.155
Today, it's just another day at the office.

00:39.725 --> 00:41.493
Narrator:
Who are the MythBusters?

00:42.528 --> 00:43.862
Adam Savage...
[ electricity crackles ]

00:43.863 --> 00:45.530
It's scientific!

00:45.531 --> 00:47.032
...and Jamie Hyneman.

00:47.033 --> 00:48.600
Jamie: Is that hot enough for ya?

00:48.601 --> 00:53.004
Between them, more than 30 years
of special-effects experience.

00:53.005 --> 00:55.807
Joining them...
Grant Imahara...

00:55.808 --> 00:57.676
He's alive!
[ laughs ]

00:57.677 --> 00:58.710
...Kari Byron...

00:58.711 --> 01:01.079
I was less excited after my first kiss.

01:01.080 --> 01:02.347
...and Tory Belleci.

01:02.348 --> 01:04.449
Dude, that was the coolest
thing I've ever done!

01:04.450 --> 01:06.017
They don't just tell the myths,

01:06.018 --> 01:09.287
they put them to the test.

because it's chalks away

- Oh.

01:32.345 --> 01:33.678
[ record scratches ]

01:33.679 --> 01:36.148
I'm, uh, adding a little
special-effects wizardry

01:36.149 --> 01:37.949
to the opening of the show.

01:37.950 --> 01:39.084
Wizardry, huh?

01:39.085 --> 01:41.887
Yeah! Check it out! I could be in space.

01:41.888 --> 01:44.689
[ beep, radio chatter ]
Wooooshh.

01:44.690 --> 01:46.258
Or underwater.

01:49.095 --> 01:51.496
Or, in the case of this particular episode,

01:51.497 --> 01:53.899
a plane, a train...
[ train whistle blows ]

01:53.900 --> 01:55.200
...or an automobile.

01:55.201 --> 01:56.902
That's what this whole episode
is gonna be about...

01:56.903 --> 01:59.671
our favorite behind-the-scenes
moments and never-told tales

01:59.672 --> 02:01.773
about anything we've ever had to do

02:01.774 --> 02:03.909
with planes, trains, and automobiles.

02:03.910 --> 02:05.010
You mean like when you
peed on the third rail.

02:05.035 --> 02:05.810
Exactly.

02:05.811 --> 02:06.912
There we go.

02:06.913 --> 02:08.979
Or when you got sick with the Blue Angels?

02:08.981 --> 02:10.080
Precisely.

02:10.082 --> 02:11.850
Or like when you crashed
your concrete glider.

02:11.851 --> 02:13.285
[ sighs ]

02:13.286 --> 02:14.653
Okay, are we gonna be totally negative

02:14.654 --> 02:16.121
about everything to do with this episode?

02:16.122 --> 02:18.490
No. I'll go along for the ride.

02:18.491 --> 02:20.058
Good. Let's go.

02:23.729 --> 02:26.431
Narrator:
And to kick-start this dirty dozen,

02:26.432 --> 02:28.433
where do we begin?

02:30.102 --> 02:32.871
Adam:
Vehicles have always been fertile for us.

02:32.872 --> 02:35.574
You might even say that vehicles
have provided the cornerstone

02:35.575 --> 02:37.742
of "MythBuster" material.

02:37.743 --> 02:41.913
Trying to pick out 12 moments
in all of these years...

02:44.116 --> 02:45.584
...it's gonna be tricky.

02:45.585 --> 02:47.252
But if we're gonna start anywhere,

02:47.253 --> 02:48.820
I would start with planes.

02:48.821 --> 02:50.589
[ engine turns over ] - Yay!
- Yeah!

02:50.590 --> 02:52.224
Narrator: Roger that.

02:54.126 --> 02:55.994
Because the aviation wing of "MythBusters"

02:55.995 --> 02:59.297
has been in full swing for some time.

03:00.566 --> 03:03.602
And for our first moment,
here's captain Hyneman.

03:03.603 --> 03:04.936
[ <i>ding</i> ]

03:04.937 --> 03:07.672
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is your captain speaking.

03:07.673 --> 03:09.641
Put your tray tables and your seats

03:09.642 --> 03:11.009
in the full upright position.

03:11.010 --> 03:13.778
Make sure you have all
your seat belts engaged,

03:13.779 --> 03:15.480
and kiss your ass goodbye.
[ <i>ding</i> ]

03:15.481 --> 03:17.449
Narrator:
It's the magic moment

03:17.450 --> 03:19.818
the MythBusters earned their wings

03:19.819 --> 03:21.953
being talked in to land.

03:21.954 --> 03:23.922
Adam: [ british accent ]
The pilot has died.

03:23.923 --> 03:27.259
For some reason, I'm the one
they turn to to land the plane.

03:27.260 --> 03:30.895
I get on the horn and say, "Hello? Hello?"

03:30.896 --> 03:34.499
"Air traffic control, talk me
how to fly this beast",

03:34.500 --> 03:36.968
"land these people safely, man".

03:36.969 --> 03:38.770
And he says, "Yes."

03:38.771 --> 03:40.405
<i>That's</i> my task.

03:40.406 --> 03:42.507
Narrator:
And to test that, they got their hands

03:42.508 --> 03:45.277
on one heck of a big boy's toy.

03:45.278 --> 03:47.012
Adam:
Over the years, we've been given

03:47.013 --> 03:49.080
some pretty amazing toys to play with...

03:49.081 --> 03:51.249
the bloodhound for "Beat the Bloodhound"...

03:51.250 --> 03:53.585
Whoa! Ho ho ho ho!

03:53.586 --> 03:56.054
...fighter jets for "Sonic Boom"...

03:56.055 --> 03:57.289
Holy crap!

03:57.290 --> 04:00.292
...and that huge hurricane-producing thing

04:00.293 --> 04:02.327
called "The Medusa" for "Hurricane Window."

04:02.328 --> 04:04.663
That was awesome!

04:04.664 --> 04:07.165
But we've never been actually allowed

04:07.166 --> 04:09.067
to fly a plane for an experiment.

04:09.068 --> 04:12.037
It turns out the F.A.A. is
pretty strict about the rules

04:12.038 --> 04:14.472
under which someone's
allowed to fly a plane,

04:14.473 --> 04:16.507
and we don't apply.

04:16.509 --> 04:19.711
Narrator: But thanks to air-traffic
controller Terry Rager,

04:19.712 --> 04:21.946
they didn't need to take to the sky.

04:21.947 --> 04:23.815
Welcome aboard.

04:23.816 --> 04:26.685
Jamie: Eventually, we were able to
get the next-best thing,

04:26.686 --> 04:30.088
and we got access to a
flight simulator at NASA.

04:30.089 --> 04:32.924
Of course, we broke it in the process,

04:32.925 --> 04:34.993
but what are you gonna do?

04:34.994 --> 04:36.394
[ alarm blaring ] What?

04:36.395 --> 04:38.863
Narrator:
The control, where the guys had to land

04:38.864 --> 04:40.632
without any assistance from the tower...

04:40.633 --> 04:42.267
[ alarm beeping ]

04:42.268 --> 04:43.802
Terrain. Okay.

04:43.803 --> 04:46.371
That means I'm really close to the terrain.
[ chuckles ]

04:46.372 --> 04:49.607
Narrator: ...went just about as well
as could be expected.

04:49.608 --> 04:52.277
I pretty much crashed and
burned almost immediately.

04:52.278 --> 04:53.745
It was grisly.

04:53.746 --> 04:55.180
[ alarm blaring ]
Okay. Wait. Oh, my!

04:55.181 --> 04:56.414
Aah! Aah!

04:56.415 --> 04:59.284
[ laughs ]

04:59.285 --> 05:01.519
Oh, I don't think I did so well.

05:01.520 --> 05:03.922
I was really surprised how difficult it was

05:03.923 --> 05:06.091
to try and fly that plane with no help

05:06.092 --> 05:07.392
and no experience at all.

05:07.393 --> 05:11.496
The thing was that all
the gauges in the plane,

05:11.497 --> 05:13.465
they're not really labeled.

05:13.466 --> 05:17.102
I need to find my speed.
Why can't I find my speed?

05:17.103 --> 05:20.505
Narrator:
And inside the ultra-realistic simulator,

05:20.506 --> 05:22.774
not being able to find the controls

05:22.775 --> 05:24.876
was the least of Jamie's problems.

05:24.877 --> 05:26.745
Male voice: <i>Don't think.</i>

05:26.746 --> 05:28.380
Why's it telling me not to think?

05:28.381 --> 05:29.581
<i>Don't think.</i>

05:29.582 --> 05:32.150
We were wondering, what sort of narrative

05:32.151 --> 05:35.687
occurred at the F.A.A. for them
to put this phrase into a plane

05:35.688 --> 05:38.356
to start yelling at the pilot under
some kind of crash conditions,

05:38.357 --> 05:39.591
"Don't think"?

05:39.592 --> 05:42.260
<i>- Don't think.</i>
<i>Jamie: - Yeah, shut up.</i>

05:42.261 --> 05:45.029
Adam: It was only later we realized
that the plane was saying...

05:45.030 --> 05:46.731
"Don't sink."

05:46.732 --> 05:49.401
Ho!

05:49.402 --> 05:51.302
Narrator:
And after two crash landings,

05:51.303 --> 05:53.772
enter air-control swami Terry.

05:53.773 --> 05:54.806
Okay.

05:54.807 --> 05:57.976
Could he talk our rookie pilots down?

05:57.977 --> 05:59.577
The most astonishing thing was, though,

05:59.578 --> 06:02.947
with guidance from our
air-traffic controller,

06:02.948 --> 06:05.183
we were able to land the plane.

06:05.184 --> 06:06.818
Okay, what's your pitch attitude?

06:06.819 --> 06:08.586
Uh, I'm at 5 degrees. Over.

06:08.587 --> 06:09.821
Very good.

06:09.822 --> 06:11.689
Narrator:
Yep, despite flying blind,

06:11.690 --> 06:14.192
Terry calmly and precisely talked

06:14.193 --> 06:15.960
not just one mythbuster...

06:16.929 --> 06:18.329
Jamie: I'm stopped.

06:18.330 --> 06:20.498
Congratulations, Jamie. You made it.

06:20.499 --> 06:23.468
...but two through two landings.

Whoo! I did it!

06:29.475 --> 06:31.009
That plane wasn't gonna fly again,

06:31.010 --> 06:33.778
but all the people inside of it were alive.

06:33.779 --> 06:36.781
It might have been a different
story with 300 passengers,

06:36.782 --> 06:39.083
but quite honestly, if I'm ever in a plane

06:39.084 --> 06:41.486
and someone asks, "Can
someone fly this plane?"

06:41.487 --> 06:44.222
I might just raise my hand.

06:44.223 --> 06:45.623
[ tires screech ]

06:45.624 --> 06:49.160
Narrator: Next is a moment about
staying on your "tows".

06:50.896 --> 06:53.064
Kari: Though towing is our best choice

06:53.065 --> 06:55.166
when we're trying to crash vehicles,

06:55.167 --> 06:56.434
because we're not gonna drive them...

06:56.435 --> 06:57.836
[ laughs ]

06:57.837 --> 07:00.071
...it can present a few problems.

07:00.072 --> 07:02.774
Narrator:
Indeed, and those problems are familiar

07:02.775 --> 07:04.976
to every "MythBusters" viewer...

07:04.977 --> 07:06.711
Jamie: It's gonna go into the water.

07:06.712 --> 07:09.547
Adam: Oh, no, no, no, no, no! Yes!

07:09.548 --> 07:14.085
...which is why occasionally
we get professional help.

07:14.086 --> 07:15.587
[ laughter ]

07:17.490 --> 07:20.525
Adam:
Specifically in the area of crashes...

07:20.526 --> 07:22.293
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

07:22.294 --> 07:25.196
...we've needed a level of
accuracy that exceeds anything

07:25.197 --> 07:27.131
we've been able to achieve on the show.

07:27.132 --> 07:29.200
And in those cases, we've actually resorted

07:29.201 --> 07:31.569
to specialized crash-test facilities.

07:33.706 --> 07:37.275
At these testing facilities,
they crash cars all the time.

07:41.180 --> 07:43.314
That was so Hollywood!

07:45.651 --> 07:47.085
They have ironed out all the bugs.

07:47.086 --> 07:48.820
They do this every single day...

07:48.821 --> 07:51.523
except for when we show up.

07:51.524 --> 07:52.557
[ horn blares ]

07:52.558 --> 07:55.293
For instance, "Instant Convertible".

07:55.294 --> 07:58.596
I don't think that went quite as planned.

07:58.597 --> 08:01.099
Narrator:
Not quite as planned, but it's no accident

08:01.100 --> 08:05.103
that this memorable mistake
made the countdown.

08:05.104 --> 08:07.205
Now, we were testing the myth
that you can drive a car

08:07.206 --> 08:10.575
- underneath a semi-truck trailer...
- Park it!

08:10.576 --> 08:12.977
...cut the top off, turn
it into a convertible,

08:12.978 --> 08:14.212
and continue on driving.

08:14.213 --> 08:17.749
Get in there. All right, good luck, buddy.

08:17.750 --> 08:20.351
Myth seemed simple. The setup was simple.

08:20.352 --> 08:22.921
But getting the thing to
work was far from simple.

08:24.523 --> 08:28.393
10, 20, 30, 40...

08:28.394 --> 08:30.929
Now, we knew the roof was gonna come off.

08:30.930 --> 08:32.730
We knew we were getting
ourselves a convertible.

08:32.731 --> 08:35.400
...and 70!

08:35.400 --> 08:36.868
Kari: Whoo!

08:36.869 --> 08:38.068
Ohh! Ho!

08:38.070 --> 08:39.604
Ohh! Ohh!

08:39.605 --> 08:42.440
What we didn't know
is that it wouldn't stop.

08:42.441 --> 08:44.008
It kept going.

08:46.211 --> 08:48.813
Narrator:
Sometimes failure is not only an option,

08:48.814 --> 08:51.616
it's a spectacular surprise.

08:51.617 --> 08:53.952
Whoo! Ho, ho! Ho, ho!

08:53.953 --> 08:55.219
Oh!

08:55.220 --> 08:57.722
What's on the other side of that berm?

Uh-oh.

09:02.595 --> 09:05.430
and saw that look on Kari's face...

09:05.431 --> 09:10.435
that mix of fear, panic,
and excitement altogether...

09:10.436 --> 09:12.236
[ camera shutter clicks ]

09:12.237 --> 09:14.672
if there is one facial expression

09:14.673 --> 09:17.241
that sums up the totality of "MythBusters",

09:17.242 --> 09:18.343
that would be it.

09:19.545 --> 09:22.547
Narrator: Yep, you'd think the MythBusters
would be used to it by now.

09:22.548 --> 09:25.450
They should always expect the unexpected.

09:28.320 --> 09:30.288
Kari: What I always wanted to imagine

is what the people on the
freeway were thinking

when they saw a car fly
up into the air vertically.

09:37.363 --> 09:40.031
That must have been a crazy sight.

Tory: It was one of those moments
where I'm glad nobody got hurt,

09:43.569 --> 09:46.738
but I'm also very glad
that it went so wrong.

09:46.739 --> 09:48.339

Next is the story that proves
road rage doesn't pay.

10:15.468 --> 10:17.669
Adam: I think it's the fact

10:17.670 --> 10:20.505
that either rising gas prices
hit us all where we live

10:20.506 --> 10:22.841
or the fact that everybody
at some point or another

Well, there's your problem.

into what we're talking about.

even more angry at that.

So I never miss an opportunity,

anywhere near fast enough

didn't go quite to plan,

15:34.053 --> 15:35.620

Because this car had a nitrous booster,

19:40.458 --> 19:43.293
magnetic tape read by
little magnetic heads,

19:43.294 --> 19:46.963
and at the moment my car
hit the ramp of the 18-wheeler,

19:46.964 --> 19:48.865
we bumped all the cameras,

19:48.866 --> 19:50.734
disengaged the heads for a second,

19:50.735 --> 19:52.402
and they all stopped recording

19:52.403 --> 19:55.372
for that key moment when
I went into the 18-wheeler.

19:55.373 --> 19:59.176
Narrator: Thankfully, however, the main
camera caught all the action,

19:59.177 --> 20:02.612
just like it did when Jamie
tried this stunt backwards.

20:02.613 --> 20:04.581
That "Knight Rider" stunt

20:04.582 --> 20:07.350
was either the most fun
I've ever had with a car,

20:07.351 --> 20:08.618
or the most terrifying.

20:08.619 --> 20:09.920
I'm not sure which.

20:09.921 --> 20:12.422
Narrator: Fun and terrifying.

20:12.423 --> 20:14.024
That's exactly why it makes the list.

20:14.025 --> 20:16.927
Well, for now, at least.

[ Adam laughs ]

20:18.863 --> 20:22.065
Jamie: Would I say that was the apex
of my stunt-driving career?

20:22.066 --> 20:23.500
I wouldn't think so.

20:23.501 --> 20:26.369
I would like to think that the
high points are yet to come.

20:26.370 --> 20:28.605
Narrator: Indeed. And our next high point

20:28.606 --> 20:31.908
is the most controversial myth of all.

20:31.909 --> 20:34.711
I must say I was surprised when
"Plane on a conveyor belt"

20:34.712 --> 20:37.080
turned out to be so darn controversial.

20:37.081 --> 20:39.683
This myth was basically a
thought experiment that said

20:39.684 --> 20:42.552
that if you're a plane trying
to take off on a conveyor belt

20:42.553 --> 20:44.588
that was going in the opposite direction

20:44.589 --> 20:45.956
that the plane wanted to go,

20:45.957 --> 20:47.691
you wouldn't be able to take off.

20:47.692 --> 20:49.526
[ motor whirring ]

20:49.527 --> 20:52.362
Adam: In the beginning, Jamie didn't
even want to do this story,

20:52.363 --> 20:54.030
because when I first explained to him

20:54.031 --> 20:56.233
that it was a controversial concept,

20:56.234 --> 20:58.001
he was like, "Why would anyone believe"

20:58.002 --> 21:00.003
"the plane wouldn't
take off? That's idiotic."

21:00.004 --> 21:02.539
Jamie:
It was like, "I'm gonna be able to fly"

21:02.540 --> 21:04.407
"if I flap my arms fast enough."

21:04.408 --> 21:06.009
It's not gonna happen.

21:06.010 --> 21:11.681
I had to print out 2-inch-thick
pile of Internet arguments

21:11.682 --> 21:14.117
to show him that this was absolutely worth

21:14.118 --> 21:15.285
us doing on the show.

21:15.286 --> 21:17.254
Narrator: And once they started testing...

21:17.255 --> 21:18.888
Adam: - I'm ready.
- Okay, go.

21:18.889 --> 21:21.491
...their mini plane and
makeshift conveyor belt

21:21.492 --> 21:24.160
proved the myth was clear for takeoff.

21:24.161 --> 21:25.895
Is that a flying plane?

21:25.896 --> 21:27.364
That is a flying plane,

21:27.365 --> 21:29.966
and it was on the paper when it took off.

21:29.967 --> 21:31.301
Adam: Excellent!

21:31.302 --> 21:35.338
Narrator: So it was time to go full-scale.

21:35.339 --> 21:37.440
Jamie:
Because we couldn't find a conveyor belt

21:37.441 --> 21:39.909
that would accommodate
an airplane taking off,

21:39.910 --> 21:44.147
we decided to go out to a runway
and just cover the entire runway

21:44.148 --> 21:46.850
with a material that was
like a conveyor belt...

21:46.851 --> 21:49.686
It's like making a very big bed.

21:49.687 --> 21:51.154
...and then we pulled it.

21:51.155 --> 21:53.523
Man: Light sport, you're clear to take off.

21:53.524 --> 21:55.992
All right, this is full-size

21:57.895 --> 22:00.730
- All right?
Adam: - Go, Jamie, go!

22:00.731 --> 22:03.266
The result of the test
showed that the plane

22:03.267 --> 22:04.668
actually was able to take off,

22:07.271 --> 22:09.939
because what the wheels
are doing on the ground

22:09.940 --> 22:13.043
doesn't have any relevance
to what the plane is doing.

22:15.680 --> 22:19.582
[ laughing ]

22:19.583 --> 22:22.018
The plane flies by moving
forward through the air,

22:22.019 --> 22:24.888
and there's nothing that is
happening with the conveyor belt

22:24.889 --> 22:26.890
that is keeping it from doing that.

22:26.891 --> 22:29.125
Oh, that was beautiful!

22:29.126 --> 22:31.261
Narrator:
But despite proving once and for all

22:31.262 --> 22:34.631
that a plane on a conveyor
belt would take to the air,

22:34.632 --> 22:36.599
believe it or not, there are still some

22:36.600 --> 22:39.336
who say the plane would remain grounded.

For those of you who
still do not believe me,

here is an experiment you
can actually do at home.

had sitting in the closet

22:52.817 --> 22:54.451
and turn it on its highest setting.

22:54.452 --> 22:57.354
Put the plane on it, and you will notice

22:57.355 --> 23:00.590
that no matter how fast
your treadmill is going

23:00.591 --> 23:01.825

Allegedly, he got electrocuted.

Testing this involved
several key components.

anatomically correct human body,

24:39.690 --> 24:41.624
with their anatomically correct dummy.

over the years from the fact

24:44.761 --> 24:47.530
that we've built what we called
an "anatomically correct" Buster

24:47.531 --> 24:49.699
and then hid that part behind a fig leaf.

24:49.700 --> 24:52.034
But the fact is, it was a tube.

24:52.035 --> 24:54.871
It was a tube that looked a
little suggestive for our show,

to admit, a family show,

28:51.742 --> 28:53.676
Oh! Ah.

28:53.677 --> 28:54.910
Narrator: Next...

28:54.911 --> 28:57.546
the "Planes, Trains & Automobiles" special

28:57.547 --> 28:58.681
goes supersonic.

28:58.682 --> 28:59.782
Oh, no!

29:04.997 --> 29:08.032
Narrator:
Coming in fast and furious at number 3

29:08.033 --> 29:10.635
is one for the speed freaks.

29:16.842 --> 29:20.011
"MythBusters" and speed
go together like this.

29:20.012 --> 29:21.746
Best friends forever.

29:21.747 --> 29:24.115
We love speed. We love going fast.

29:24.116 --> 29:26.684
We love things that go
fast, and even Jamie...

29:26.685 --> 29:28.719
[ Jamie laughs ]

29:28.720 --> 29:31.756
...gets a big, fat smile on
that mustachioed face

29:31.757 --> 29:33.791
when he goes really, really fast.

29:33.792 --> 29:36.360
Narrator:
That need for speed has seen the team

29:36.361 --> 29:38.829
put the pedal to the metal...

29:38.830 --> 29:40.731
Adam: Yeah!

29:40.732 --> 29:44.368
...and put rockets on cars
for explosive acceleration.

29:48.106 --> 29:49.173
Or not.

29:50.575 --> 29:56.180
But those can't compare to
traveling at the speed of sound.

29:56.181 --> 29:58.449
It is absolutely easy to determine

29:58.450 --> 30:00.184
the fastest we've ever gone on the show.

30:00.185 --> 30:01.852
It is when I flew with the "Blue Angels"

30:01.853 --> 30:04.255
to test the sonic-boom myth.

30:04.256 --> 30:08.092
Strap in. It's time... to go supersonic.

30:08.093 --> 30:10.227
Jamie: The question here was whether or not

30:10.228 --> 30:11.962
every time you have an aircraft

30:11.963 --> 30:14.832
creating a sonic boom
when it flies over a house,

30:14.833 --> 30:16.667
it's gonna break glass in that house.

30:16.668 --> 30:18.569
Walborn: - You ready to go flying?
- I am.

30:20.505 --> 30:22.907
Adam:
We discussed it in house who would fly,

30:22.908 --> 30:24.842
and we realized that it had to be me,

30:24.843 --> 30:27.778
because I was gonna get sick,
and that was going to be funny,

30:27.779 --> 30:31.015
as opposed to Jamie's
stoic face under 7 G's,

30:31.016 --> 30:33.818
which would just look,
you know, a little heavier.

30:33.819 --> 30:36.754
Narrator: And from the very first
surprise rapid ascent...

30:36.755 --> 30:38.622
Walborn: - Ready to go flying?
- I am.

30:38.623 --> 30:39.724
Ready, hit it.

30:42.828 --> 30:45.596
...the G-forces had
Adam's stomach churning.

30:45.597 --> 30:46.864
Oh-ho!

30:46.865 --> 30:48.666
Adam: I'd like to add a couple of notes

30:48.667 --> 30:50.668
about the vomiting and
the passing-out thing.

30:50.669 --> 30:51.836
Wow!

30:51.837 --> 30:53.771
One is I didn't actually vomit

30:53.772 --> 30:56.474
until the third time we pulled 7 G's

30:56.475 --> 30:58.843
in some kind of barrel roll.

30:58.844 --> 31:01.746
I managed to make it two full
times without getting sick.

31:01.747 --> 31:03.514
I'm starting to feel a little nauseous.

31:03.515 --> 31:04.915
I think I may throw up.

31:04.916 --> 31:06.717
All right, you got the bag back there?

31:06.718 --> 31:09.086
[ coughs ]

31:09.087 --> 31:11.956
The other one about the passing
out, which really surprised me,

31:11.957 --> 31:15.059
was that the pilot knew
that I was about to pass out

31:15.060 --> 31:16.727
before even I knew.

31:16.728 --> 31:19.563
Going on up to 5 G's.
We got 5 G's. 5 1/2.

31:19.564 --> 31:22.133
And he's looking at me
through this tiny little mirror.

31:22.134 --> 31:25.402
But he could see this telltale
sign of my eyes going cloudy...

31:25.403 --> 31:26.704
[ grunts ]

31:26.705 --> 31:28.439
...and then my head, and
he's like, "Stay with me, Adam".

31:28.440 --> 31:30.908
Stick with me, Adam.
You got it. You got it.

31:30.909 --> 31:33.110
And I was like "Huh! huh!",
[panting]

31:33.111 --> 31:35.946
and I brought myself
back out of the tunnel,

31:35.947 --> 31:37.515
and then I went all the way in the tunnel,

31:37.516 --> 31:38.916
and I totally passed out.

31:38.917 --> 31:41.519
Come on. Stay with us. Stay with us.

31:41.520 --> 31:45.089
We got it. Come back.

31:45.090 --> 31:46.557
You with me?

31:46.558 --> 31:49.460
I'm with you. I have almost quite
passed out there for a second.

31:49.461 --> 31:52.496
Narrator: But Adam's aerobatics
were just the beginning.

31:52.497 --> 31:55.299
MythBusters, "Blue Angels", test site.

31:55.300 --> 31:57.234
The real question was...

31:57.235 --> 32:00.604
would the sonic boom shatter glass?

32:00.605 --> 32:01.939
That ought to do it.

32:03.408 --> 32:04.809
We are headed straight for them.

32:04.810 --> 32:07.878
2,000 feet at Mach 1.07.

32:07.879 --> 32:10.848
[ sonic boom ]

32:10.849 --> 32:12.383
Wow!

32:12.384 --> 32:13.818
That was something.

32:13.819 --> 32:15.252
How loud was it on the ground?

32:15.253 --> 32:18.923
Well, we were wearing
earplugs and earmuffs,

32:18.924 --> 32:20.257
if that tells you anything.

32:20.258 --> 32:22.993
Narrator:
The sound may have been ear-splitting,

32:22.994 --> 32:25.529
but despite flying as low as 200 feet...

32:25.530 --> 32:27.131
Adam: Oh, no!

32:27.132 --> 32:28.232
[ sonic boom ]

32:28.233 --> 32:29.867
[ sonic boom ]

32:29.868 --> 32:32.403
...it wasn't the boom that broke the glass,

32:32.404 --> 32:34.638
but the distortion of the frame.

32:34.639 --> 32:36.440
Well, there's your problem.

32:36.441 --> 32:39.977
But for Adam, it was all worth it.

32:39.978 --> 32:42.580
You know, when you're a kid,
you always want to end up

32:42.581 --> 32:44.648
being some kind of secret
agent or superhero.

32:44.649 --> 32:47.551
And "MythBusters" has really allowed me

32:47.552 --> 32:50.521
to explore so many aspects of that.

32:50.522 --> 32:52.289
[ sonic boom ]

32:52.290 --> 32:54.325
[ laughs ]

32:54.326 --> 32:57.895
I have literally been faster
than a speeding bullet.

32:57.896 --> 33:00.297
I have not yet leaped a
building in a single bound,

33:00.298 --> 33:02.132
but that's on our list.

33:02.133 --> 33:05.402
Narrator:
Coming in at number 2 is a story so big,

33:05.403 --> 33:06.937
we did it twice.

33:11.109 --> 33:13.978
The myth was that a taxi
drove behind a jet airliner

33:13.979 --> 33:15.179
as it was taking off,

33:15.180 --> 33:16.847
and the blast from the jet

33:16.848 --> 33:20.351
picked up the taxi and just threw it.

33:20.352 --> 33:23.721
Narrator: The first time the MythBusters
tried to test this myth,

33:23.722 --> 33:26.791
the insurance company took
the wind out of their sails.

33:26.792 --> 33:30.194
"Jet Taxi" was our first intimate
experience with insurance.

33:30.695 --> 33:33.530
And the thing that I couldn't
wrap my head around

33:33.531 --> 33:37.101
was how we were going
to damage a jet airplane

33:37.102 --> 33:39.670
by putting something <i>behind</i> it.

33:39.671 --> 33:42.606
We don't know what the
jet will do to the taxi.

33:42.607 --> 33:45.242
But there's no way in hell
that taxi is gonna do anything

33:45.243 --> 33:47.211
but go farther away from the jet.

33:47.212 --> 33:48.579
I didn't get it.

33:49.881 --> 33:53.417
Oh, that would have flipped our taxi!

33:53.418 --> 33:55.753
Narrator: But two years later,

33:55.754 --> 33:59.690
the guys got wind of
another chance at a jet.

33:59.691 --> 34:02.626
When an opportunity came up again to do it,

34:02.627 --> 34:04.395
there's no way we're turning it down.

34:04.396 --> 34:09.667
Narrator: Yep... in Michigan,
Kalitta Air and their 747

34:09.668 --> 34:13.003
were more than happy to let the
MythBusters blow off some steam.

34:13.004 --> 34:15.172
- I love you, man!
- I love you, too!

34:15.172 --> 34:16.774
The taxi was lined up,

34:16.775 --> 34:18.342
and the engines roared into action.

34:20.078 --> 34:24.114
And all of a sudden, part
of the runway peels up.

34:27.319 --> 34:31.755
This whole bed of pavement just flies away,

34:31.755 --> 34:33.690
kind of like a roof in a hurricane.

34:33.692 --> 34:36.293
And that was it. I was like, "That's
it. They're gonna shut us down",

34:36.293 --> 34:37.962
"they're not gonna
let us continue testing".

34:37.963 --> 34:41.598
The owner came out, looked at
it, laughed, and we kept going.

34:41.599 --> 34:43.233
Narrator: By this stage, it was clear,

34:43.234 --> 34:46.036
come hail or high water,

34:46.036 --> 34:48.539
the cab was going into the jet stream.

34:49.975 --> 34:53.444
Kari:
I had no idea what we were about to see.

34:55.313 --> 34:57.848
[ laughter ] Yes!

34:59.751 --> 35:04.822
Kari: That taxi tumbled down the
lawn just head over heel,

35:04.823 --> 35:06.824
over and over.

35:06.825 --> 35:09.393
I mean, it was <i>so</i> much force.

35:09.394 --> 35:11.628
[ laughter ]

35:13.164 --> 35:16.934
Tory:
Getting the cab to flip was good enough.

35:16.935 --> 35:18.602
But, I mean, this is the one chance

35:18.603 --> 35:21.472
that we get to play with an actual 747.

35:21.473 --> 35:23.674
I mean, do you really think
we're gonna stop there?

35:23.675 --> 35:25.843
You're gonna be a bus driver now!

35:27.579 --> 35:30.614
Grant: This is a full-size school bus.

35:30.615 --> 35:35.552
And the jet wash just picked up
the bus like it was nothing...

35:35.553 --> 35:38.088
Kari: Whoo!

35:38.089 --> 35:40.691
...flipped it over and slammed
it down right on its roof

35:40.692 --> 35:43.427
and crushed the whole thing.

35:43.428 --> 35:44.995
I mean, it was amazing.

35:45.964 --> 35:48.766
Narrator: Yep, it certainly was
the school of hard knocks

35:48.767 --> 35:50.101
for our bus,

35:50.902 --> 35:55.706
making the jet-taxi myth literally a blast.

35:58.443 --> 36:00.811
Grant: You know, with footage
like this, it's easy to see

36:00.812 --> 36:04.248
why this is the biggest and
most bad-ass moment.

36:04.249 --> 36:06.016
Narrator: Well, not quite, Grant.

36:06.017 --> 36:08.352
There's one more to come.

36:08.353 --> 36:09.653
Kari: Whoo!

36:11.823 --> 36:13.724
Next up...

36:13.725 --> 36:16.627
the ultimate "Planes, Trains
& Automobile" moment.

I highly recommend it. Forget therapy.

[ tires screech ]

36:27.871 --> 36:30.873
Narrator: And now the number 1 moment,

36:30.874 --> 36:36.145
the fantastic finale of
"Planes, Trains & Automobiles".

36:37.681 --> 36:41.317
And it's all about our
destructive relationship

36:41.318 --> 36:42.952
with cars.

36:42.953 --> 36:45.955
We've set them on fire.
We've shot them up.

[ squeaks ]

36:47.991 --> 36:50.293
We've crashed them.

We've dropped them from helicopters.

36:55.065 --> 36:56.265
- We've blown them up.
- Bye-bye!

36:57.735 --> 36:59.836
Adam: The fact is, we've destroyed so many,

36:59.837 --> 37:02.705
that choosing one as a
perfect representation

37:02.706 --> 37:05.708
of the ultimate car
explosion is impossible.

37:05.709 --> 37:07.543
It's like trying to decide
which is better...

37:07.544 --> 37:09.679
"Star Trek", or "Star Wars".

37:09.680 --> 37:11.547
"Star Wars", by the way.

37:11.548 --> 37:15.718
At any rate, we've each decided
to pick our own favorite.

37:17.154 --> 37:20.423
Narrator:
With so much car carnage over the years,

37:20.424 --> 37:23.226
our hosts just can't agree on the best.

37:23.227 --> 37:25.995
And that means that we've got five times

37:25.996 --> 37:29.031
the awesome automotive mayhem.

37:29.032 --> 37:31.768
Grant:
So, my favorite car-destruction sequences

37:31.769 --> 37:36.172
was when we split the car
with a snow plow in Wisconsin.

37:36.173 --> 37:38.975
Tory:
Now, that is the plow we're looking for!

37:38.976 --> 37:42.211
Grant: So, picture this wonderful
snowy landscape,

37:42.212 --> 37:43.579
car at one end,

37:43.580 --> 37:46.783
giant, razor-sharp snow-plow blade

37:46.784 --> 37:49.619
and this giant snow plow at the other end.

37:49.620 --> 37:53.022
In 3, 2, 1, go!

37:53.023 --> 37:55.725
Grant: Tow the car really fast,

37:55.726 --> 37:58.995
go straight down the track...

37:58.996 --> 38:01.397
Whoa!

38:01.398 --> 38:04.200
...and the thing splits like a banana peel.

38:09.239 --> 38:13.810
The car almost split in two.

38:13.811 --> 38:15.445
That's once in a lifetime.

38:15.446 --> 38:16.979

38:16.980 --> 38:19.382
Like driving a car stuck
together with duct tape

38:19.383 --> 38:21.951
after Kari has had her evil way with it.

38:21.952 --> 38:26.355
All right. Time to wreck this car.

38:26.356 --> 38:30.493
Personally, my favorite way
to destroy a car... by hand.

38:31.929 --> 38:35.231
I love destroying cars...

38:35.232 --> 38:38.734
Breaking glass, crunching metal.

38:38.735 --> 38:40.837
It's awesome.

38:40.838 --> 38:43.673
Taking a car apart,
completely destroying it,

38:43.674 --> 38:46.576
is this really amazing,
cathartic experience.

38:46.577 --> 38:50.880
The shattering of glass,
the smoking of the torch,

38:50.881 --> 38:54.283
the just metal falling apart before you.

ever had gets released.

something Jamie knows a lot about.

39:13.070 --> 39:16.272
Kari: Whoo!

39:16.273 --> 39:17.406
I have to say,

39:17.407 --> 39:19.242
I think "Dukes of Hazzard" was my favorite,

39:19.243 --> 39:22.812
because that involved running
a car at a ramp at high speed,

39:22.813 --> 39:26.549
and it had to go through the
air something like 175 feet

39:26.550 --> 39:28.184
without going splat.

39:29.520 --> 39:33.422
Narrator: And for that, all they
did was build a ramp...

Nothing like a good hump
is what I always say.

39:35.893 --> 39:39.829
Narrator: ...and then remote-control a
car over it at 70 miles per hour.

39:39.830 --> 39:41.264
Simple, right?

39:41.265 --> 39:44.367
Jamie: The thing was that it all had
to come together perfectly

39:44.368 --> 39:47.403
for it to work, and that
was a pretty tall order.

39:47.404 --> 39:48.838
We can totally do it.

Jamie more than matched.

40:05.622 --> 40:07.223
Jamie: Oh, my Lord!

40:07.224 --> 40:10.526
The car flew 173 feet through the air.

40:10.527 --> 40:14.163
But the landing was a little rough.

40:15.299 --> 40:19.168
Adam:
The car is busted. The myth is busted.

40:19.169 --> 40:21.203
It's very hard on a car if you do that.

40:21.204 --> 40:22.838
Narrator: Hard on the car for sure.

40:22.839 --> 40:25.274
But when it comes to automotive torture,

40:25.275 --> 40:27.209
Tory's choice has it all.

40:28.211 --> 40:30.146
Kari: Oh!

40:30.147 --> 40:32.181
"The Green Hornet" episode,

40:32.182 --> 40:36.185
we probably did more damage
to cars than we've ever done

40:36.186 --> 40:38.020
in the history of "MythBusters".

40:38.021 --> 40:41.090
I mean, we took this
beautiful classic car...

40:41.091 --> 40:42.391
Now, that's a pretty car.

40:42.392 --> 40:44.560
...shot it up with machine guns...

40:44.561 --> 40:46.562
[ gunfire ]

40:46.563 --> 40:48.698
That didn't suck.

40:48.699 --> 40:50.433
...and then stuck it in a steel elevator

40:50.434 --> 40:52.735
to see if we could crush it in half...

40:52.736 --> 40:54.303
[ metal screeching ]

40:54.304 --> 40:55.905
Kari: - Whoa!
Grant: - Do it! Do it!

40:55.906 --> 40:57.306
Tory: - Stop!
- Ohh!

40:57.307 --> 40:58.608
Yeah!

40:58.609 --> 41:00.676
That didn't work, so then we
just chopped a car in half...

41:04.047 --> 41:05.881
Whoo!

41:05.882 --> 41:07.350
...and drove that around.

41:07.351 --> 41:09.485
[ laughs ]

41:09.486 --> 41:11.354
Dude, that is crazy!

41:11.355 --> 41:12.688
Whoo!

41:12.689 --> 41:13.990
It was brutal.

41:13.991 --> 41:16.025
Narrator: Brutal indeed.

41:16.026 --> 41:18.694
They did everything bar blowing it up.

41:18.695 --> 41:22.064
But that's okay, because Adam's
favorite has that covered.

41:24.267 --> 41:26.736
Mine is the "Viewers' Special" explosion.

41:26.737 --> 41:28.504
This kid had written to us

41:28.505 --> 41:31.207
saying he wanted us to
blow up his parents' car,

41:31.208 --> 41:32.842
and we agreed to do it.

41:32.843 --> 41:35.645
Narrator:
And in typical "MythBusters" style,

41:35.646 --> 41:39.215
they granted this wish not once, but twice.

41:39.216 --> 41:42.518
First time, it's gonna be
a movie-style explosion,

41:42.519 --> 41:44.887
like from the '70s TV shows
that you grew up with.

41:44.888 --> 41:47.323
Narrator: For that movie-style explosion,

41:47.324 --> 41:50.626
the guys created some movie-style action.

41:50.627 --> 41:52.361
Jamie and I stood a safe distance away.

41:52.362 --> 41:53.829
I think it was about 100 feet.

41:53.830 --> 41:57.366
I had a mat in front of me, and
Jamie had an explosives plunger.

41:57.367 --> 41:59.301
Fire in the hole!

41:59.302 --> 42:02.705
3, 2, 1!

42:02.706 --> 42:05.408
Jamie's action was to push the plunger,

42:05.409 --> 42:09.078
and mine was to be running
and to be hopefully in midair

42:09.079 --> 42:11.247
at the exact second
he pushed that plunger...

42:15.485 --> 42:17.153
...so that when the actual
explosion went off,

42:17.154 --> 42:21.123
there I was in midair on
that high-speed shot.

42:24.461 --> 42:26.762
Man, it is my favorite high-speed shot.

42:26.763 --> 42:29.098
It is me reliving my 7-year-old desire

42:29.099 --> 42:31.200
to be an action-movie hero.

42:36.473 --> 42:37.907
And we got the shot.

42:37.908 --> 42:40.743
Narrator:
But the Hollywood stunt action took a dive

42:40.744 --> 42:43.846
when it came to the real-world explosion.

42:43.847 --> 42:45.648
Fire in the hole!

42:45.649 --> 42:49.585
3, 2, 1!

42:55.592 --> 42:58.294
Narrator: Because one thing is for sure...

42:58.295 --> 43:00.596
with the MythBusters around...

43:00.597 --> 43:02.298
it doesn't matter how...

43:02.299 --> 43:03.799
[ gunfire ]

43:06.269 --> 43:09.138
...it's gonna be car-mageddon.

43:10.639 --> 43:12.475
[ laughs ]
No more car!

43:12.500 --> 43:16.500
