I do not like secrets.

00:53.186 --> 00:57.983
- Sus, you need to riding.

Well no, it's a wedding ring.
Sus, Mads will marry you.

01:46.160 --> 01:50.123
No I will not. It is just
a can ring, as you said.

01:50.289 --> 01:54.753
Well, for Sus is something very special.

01:54.919 --> 01:59.383
One must be a great man for

Spot. Hilmer. Save it for the show.
I try to practice.

03:45.038 --> 03:49.376
You practice more than us,
and we are actors.

03:49.543 --> 03:52.045
No, we're as super heroes.

03:52.212 --> 03:56.550
We are actors who pretend
like we're superheroes.

03:56.759 --> 03:59.971
Yes, Okra on to something.

04:01.639 --> 04:05.268

a robot that farts?

04:05.435 --> 04:11.692
- Let me now practicing.
- You always practice, but does nothing.

04:11.900 --> 04:15.613
I'm just robots.
What do you know about love?

04:15.821 --> 04:20.868
Love, nonsense! You're just afraid
to propose to your girlfriend.

04:21.035 --> 04:26.166
No I am not. But it just
done in the right way.

04:26.291 --> 04:31.671
With a nice ring, at the right time
and with the right amount of magic.

04:32.881 --> 04:38.053
- Magi?
- We can do everything. We're superheroes.

04:38.220 --> 04:42.016
Yes, play superheroes know everything
about magic.

04:45.561 --> 04:48.690

04:48.898 --> 04:53.361
- Get so the robots out.
- Window. Now!

05:01.036 --> 05:06.918
Remember to buy chocolates and roses,
for it is soon valentine.

05:10.380 --> 05:13.508
Wow, she's just so delicious.

05:13.675 --> 05:16.053
Pardon.

05:25.438 --> 05:31.027
- See, it's Sus.
-  The brave have luck in love.

05:31.236 --> 05:35.907
- This is my girlfriend.
- It's a good one.

05:36.074 --> 05:41.955
As if she would get along with,
who are friends with the kind of idiots.

05:42.122 --> 05:45.376
It's called "idols" spaghetti arms.

05:45.501 --> 05:48.337
- Come on, we're late.
- What should we?

05:48.462 --> 05:52.383

on Valentine's Day.

05:56.972 --> 05:59.516
Such a must Sus garden.

05:59.683 --> 06:03.437
Century Diamond is not for sale.

06:03.604 --> 06:06.315
But what about this?

06:06.440 --> 06:12.029
A classic design
with a gemstone quality.

06:12.196 --> 06:16.284
The only high
at the ring's price.

06:16.409 --> 06:21.248
For a woman equal the value
to the man's value.

06:22.541 --> 06:25.377
Do you sell candy rings?

06:27.463 --> 06:31.509
We also have something
at the cheaper end.

06:31.676 --> 06:34.137
No, that must be it here.

06:35.179 --> 06:37.557
An excellent choice.

06:37.724 --> 06:40.852
Are you crazy?
It has not you can afford.

06:41.061 --> 06:43.730
He's crazy like a love.

06:43.939 --> 06:48.527
First you lose your mind.
So you lose everything you own.

06:49.528 --> 06:54.408
Today begins or ends my life.

06:55.493 --> 06:59.122
Century Diamond is not for sale.

07:01.124 --> 07:03.668
Run! It's Oscar.

07:03.835 --> 07:08.674

I stole it?

07:08.841 --> 07:12.178
You're
the greatest super villain ever.

07:12.344 --> 07:17.475
- What did she expect?
- As true as it is said, Victor.

07:26.151 --> 07:32.533
This is the best day of my life.
Hey, I peed shown in the pants.

07:35.035 --> 07:37.371
This way, ma'am.

07:40.208 --> 07:42.877
I need to talk to the mayor.

07:46.006 --> 07:48.216
Stop, you two!

07:48.383 --> 07:53.555
I am a former supervillain.
I am a new person now. See for yourself.

08:10.949 --> 08:16.372
People with itchy trigger finger
should not play with guns.

08:16.538 --> 08:19.583
Good morning darling.

08:19.750 --> 08:21.335
Oscar.

08:25.048 --> 08:27.592
Here I am, beloved Katarina.

08:27.759 --> 08:32.304

08:38.854 --> 08:44.527
Time? Oh well, time. Why do it
a bell to ring?

08:46.446 --> 08:52.285
Well of course.
It is time to look at the sky.

08:55.831 --> 08:58.751
Oscar, stop them.

08:58.917 --> 09:02.963
- Only if you marry me.
- It's madness.

09:03.172 --> 09:06.551
Yes, because I'm
crazy in love with you.

09:06.676 --> 09:10.138
Oscar, stop the missiles,
and then we can ...

09:12.557 --> 09:16.603
- Talk about it.
- I'm not a man who speaks.

09:16.728 --> 09:18.605
I shop.

09:20.733 --> 09:22.943
Oscar!

09:24.028 --> 09:26.739
I love you.

09:30.159 --> 09:34.539

09:37.793 --> 09:44.842
Yes, just cried if you like.
But I am waiting for your answer.

09:45.009 --> 09:50.890
Guards Hold the criminals
the police come.

09:51.808 --> 09:56.771
Criminals? Is it a crime
that would make you happy?

09:56.938 --> 10:00.984
I am really happy,
for you to jail.

10:02.236 --> 10:05.906
Are you as completely crazy?
You can hit Katarina.

10:16.668 --> 10:18.378
Victor!

10:18.545 --> 10:23.342
It went very well, right?
We talk so.

10:25.302 --> 10:27.888
- They drop away.
- Ring.

10:42.821 --> 10:49.203
- Oscar!
- Catherine, I love you.

10:52.415 --> 10:56.586
- Mr. Plump coming.
- Mr. Plump coming. Hurry up.

10:56.711 --> 11:02.634
Okay, let's make a super nice try
and really impress Mr. Plump.

11:02.801 --> 11:06.513
Ox, you're the villain
and will have that princess -

11:06.680 --> 11:10.934
- Which is perched on the roof,
must come down and marry you.

11:11.101 --> 11:14.230
And what's my motivation?

11:14.397 --> 11:17.859
You want fervently
to marry her.

11:18.025 --> 11:24.741
So actually I have a deep
need for love and tenderness.

11:24.866 --> 11:28.704
Exactly. And the princess called Sus.

11:28.870 --> 11:33.542
Like my girlfriend, Sus,
to be sitting right there.

11:33.709 --> 11:40.383
Mads will propose to her during the show.
When I meet the love of my life?

11:40.550 --> 11:43.470
Come on, Zang. You're a monk.

11:43.636 --> 11:46.264
This is gonna be so wild.

11:48.266 --> 11:52.020
Do not smash scene
This time. Okay?

11:52.187 --> 11:55.107
- What did he say?
- Have no idea.

11:55.316 --> 12:01.989
- We must rescue the princess.
- And smash anything that gets in the way.

12:05.618 --> 12:09.164
- Mr. Plump is here.
- Heroes!

12:25.014 --> 12:27.308
Sir. Plump, we are ready.

12:27.475 --> 12:31.021
This better FUNKE.
But it seems not.

12:31.188 --> 12:35.192
And I'll leave the helm
for pirate Jack.

12:35.400 --> 12:41.240
Do not worry. The show will park
crowd-puller on Valentine's Day.

12:41.449 --> 12:45.161
-  I love you! I love you!
- We'll see.

12:46.537 --> 12:48.206
Here we go.

12:55.589 --> 12:57.549
Oh no.

13:02.012 --> 13:03.597
Heroes!

13:03.764 --> 13:08.394
Paws away from her,
Your skrotskrummel.

13:08.561 --> 13:13.525
Disrespectful fools.
No defies Ox King. Kill them.

13:25.496 --> 13:29.667
Quiet now, friends.
In destroying the stage.

13:31.586 --> 13:35.215
Think that valentine
can be so fun.

13:35.423 --> 13:37.843
Yes, look at this.

13:53.026 --> 13:55.737
- Fire.
- Get out of the way.

14:04.037 --> 14:05.831
Stop!

14:12.088 --> 14:16.092
I get fired
and made into soda machines.

14:29.899 --> 14:34.153
- What are you doing, paphoved?
- Sus Do not ask about the show.

14:34.320 --> 14:38.199
Hi, I need to do a segment
on Valentine's Day procession.

14:38.366 --> 14:43.955
We are the last stop,
and I invite you as my guest.

14:46.291 --> 14:49.962
Okay.
Is that you, Mads?

14:50.129 --> 14:54.759
- No, I'm a minitaur.
- Snuggle Bear.

14:54.926 --> 15:01.099
You're Sus Kastanjenborg,
the hottest reporter on Channel 7th

15:03.727 --> 15:06.647
Can I have your autograph?

15:06.813 --> 15:10.025
- Mads, that is.
- Come on.

15:10.192 --> 15:15.740
Okay. But first, tell me
about your great Valentine show.

15:17.116 --> 15:20.787
Yes of course...
What?

15:21.830 --> 15:25.333
Yes, Mads, tell her all about the show.

15:26.835 --> 15:30.714
Yes I'll do that.
It is a surprise.

15:30.881 --> 15:35.594
I know it will be a valentine,
you never forget.

15:36.637 --> 15:41.059
- Where is it exciting.
- Yes ...

15:41.225 --> 15:43.770
I need help.

15:45.814 --> 15:50.319
- You should fix me.
- I asked you a single service.

15:50.527 --> 15:55.574
To help me free to Sus,
and even it you could find out.

15:55.741 --> 16:01.581
I would absolutely smashing scene,
so now we have garbage gig.

16:01.747 --> 16:05.043
Where is it humiliating. I think...

16:06.795 --> 16:11.925
- Now we are superheroes without a show.
- It's like a newspaper without news.

16:12.050 --> 16:16.555
- Or break without dance.
- Or hot outside though.

16:17.473 --> 16:20.267
How am I now free Sus?

16:33.198 --> 16:34.241
APPROVED

16:41.123 --> 16:43.084
It makes nas.

16:50.633 --> 16:52.218
Clown.

16:52.385 --> 16:55.472
Why is it so difficult?

16:55.681 --> 17:00.269
- Because you have changed the code.
- Do i have it?

17:19.080 --> 17:23.042
I do not understand, Victor.
Why is she mad at me?

17:23.167 --> 17:26.047
Were there too many balloons?

17:32.637 --> 17:37.142
Why are you so infatuated with
the woman? Is love so important?

17:37.267 --> 17:40.437
What do you know about it?
You're just an evil eye man.

17:40.646 --> 17:47.153
- How do you know you have built me.
- Use your evil to help me.

17:47.319 --> 17:52.325
She must have an offer she can not
say no to. Something big.

17:52.492 --> 17:56.413
Something scary. Something...

17:59.166 --> 18:01.543
Oh! I got it!

18:02.794 --> 18:07.424
Valentin parade!
Of course. It's perfect.

18:08.425 --> 18:13.347
Broken glass and broken hearts mark
super villain Oscars return.

18:13.514 --> 18:16.684
The man is insane,
Armed and dangerous -

18:16.851 --> 18:21.523
- And information about his whereabouts should
immediately passed on to the police.

18:21.731 --> 18:27.738
It's just not good enough, Oscar.
Sus Kastanjenborg reported.

18:27.905 --> 18:31.033
Are you okay?
He did well with you no harm?

18:31.200 --> 18:34.162
I'm fine.

18:34.287 --> 18:39.751
- But I have exciting news for you.
- Pardon.

18:39.918 --> 18:45.590
Hey, Mads. Can I call later?
I am with Aunt Catherine.

18:45.799 --> 18:49.762
For a moment, darling.
She is with her aunt Catherine.

18:49.928 --> 18:53.641
- So what?
- Her aunt hates me.

18:53.849 --> 18:57.311
Soda Machine.
I like soft drinks, -

18:57.478 --> 19:00.523
- But I will not
become an automaton.

19:00.732 --> 19:04.319
She has turned its ugly head on?

19:04.486 --> 19:07.447
You are not funny.

19:10.409 --> 19:14.663
- Are you doing anything tonight?
- Tonight?

19:16.999 --> 19:21.838
It has been a long day,
and I am a little tired. Gab.

19:22.005 --> 19:25.216
Oh no, she's tired.

19:26.218 --> 19:32.558
Meet me at the Ferris wheel at
eight. I have a big surprise.

19:32.766 --> 19:33.892
Yes?

19:35.936 --> 19:37.688
Is that a yes?

19:41.359 --> 19:44.112
Okay, I'm coming.

19:47.282 --> 19:51.495
I spoke with my friend this morning
and said you were created to work.

19:51.662 --> 19:54.873
News Difficult? Wow quite holiday.

19:55.040 --> 19:58.627
- How crazy.
- You deserve it, my friend.

20:00.546 --> 20:04.092
- A moment. London?
- Whats the problem?

20:04.258 --> 20:08.013
I was just thinking of Mads.

20:08.179 --> 20:12.476
- Then there's not much to think about.
- What does that mean?

20:12.643 --> 20:19.567
This is your opportunity of a lifetime, and Mads
is a child living with robots.

20:19.733 --> 20:25.907
- He's not a child.
- He's just a mechanic in Robo World.

20:26.074 --> 20:28.535
I do not care.

20:28.701 --> 20:32.956
I feel relaxed and happy
with Mads. He makes me laugh.

20:33.123 --> 20:37.085
- But he has no future plans.
- He has many plans.

20:37.211 --> 20:42.007
They go just always crooked. But he has
a big surprise for me tonight.

20:42.174 --> 20:47.847
It is probably nonsense and ends
in disaster, as usual.

20:48.014 --> 20:51.476
- You are impossible.
- Remember the helmet.

20:54.146 --> 20:59.234
- Mads is a loser, right?
- When not if he lives with robots.

21:00.027 --> 21:02.321
This is the plan.

21:02.446 --> 21:08.745
Ox leads her to the Ferris wheel,
and Zang sends her to the top.

21:08.953 --> 21:15.627
I fly over to Sus, while spot,
Okra and Hilmer runs in the roller coaster.

21:15.794 --> 21:18.296
Hilmer, follow now.

21:18.422 --> 21:24.011
So send minitaurerne aloft
in a splendid fireworks show -

21:24.136 --> 21:30.101
- Forming the words:
Will you marry me, Sus?

21:30.268 --> 21:35.023
So I hop into the gondola,
shows her the ring and she says yes.

21:35.190 --> 21:36.942
Yes.

21:37.108 --> 21:42.573
And we live happily
our dying day. Any questions?

21:42.739 --> 21:48.371
- Is all this fuss necessary?
- Okay, no question. Come on.

22:13.397 --> 22:16.568
It is fantastic.

22:18.278 --> 22:23.158
Show you as a man.
Show you as the best man.

22:24.284 --> 22:28.205
- Now's the time.
- Here we go.

22:30.040 --> 22:33.502
It goes according to plan.

22:37.757 --> 22:39.467
The ring!

23:04.661 --> 23:08.332
- Why are you standing next to me?
- I do not know.

23:09.458 --> 23:10.501
CLOSE

23:13.879 --> 23:15.423
Mads.

23:18.634 --> 23:20.511
This is it!

23:21.721 --> 23:23.640
- Hilmer!
- Quiet.

23:58.677 --> 24:00.554
Oh no.

24:03.516 --> 24:06.644
Is not her reporter
from Channel 7?

24:06.811 --> 24:12.651
And soon the star of the best
YouTube clip, I uploaded.

24:14.903 --> 24:16.405
Sus!

24:18.741 --> 24:21.827
Sus, wait. Sus.

24:24.497 --> 24:29.502
- I'm terribly sorry.
- Is this your big surprise?

24:29.627 --> 24:33.507
No not at all.
I do not know what happened.

24:33.632 --> 24:35.509
What? Tax...

24:35.634 --> 24:38.345
WOULD YOU LIKE TO POISON ME PUS

24:38.512 --> 24:42.683
It is an error.
First: Who is Pus?

24:42.850 --> 24:47.605
Aunt Catherine was right.
You are just a child.

24:47.730 --> 24:50.650
Wait Sus ...

24:50.817 --> 24:56.657
Wow, what a disaster.
You'd better consult a lawyer.

24:59.034 --> 25:00.828
It is over.

25:00.995 --> 25:05.541
It's Valentine's Day tomorrow, and I
can not achieve to prepare myself. Thanks.

25:05.666 --> 25:10.588
-  You  crashed with an airship.
- I tried to save Sus' ring.

25:10.713 --> 25:14.551
Ring, ring, ring! I am sick to death of
to talk about the ring.

25:14.676 --> 25:17.637
You have a nice ring now.

25:20.641 --> 25:24.353
You are right.
I have a big, beautiful ring.

25:24.520 --> 25:29.066
Come, friends.
We must plan a new courtship.

26:16.618 --> 26:18.661
This is for you, Sus.

26:18.787 --> 26:20.789
Loved Katarina.

26:20.956 --> 26:25.836
You force me to use this
key to lock your heart up.

26:26.003 --> 26:29.423
Pst, Victor. Victor!

26:31.634 --> 26:35.930
Either you against the ring,
my lovely dove -

26:36.097 --> 26:41.853
- Or put my mighty
Oscar-robot your beloved city in ruins.

26:44.022 --> 26:48.610
I do not think of you do.
I think ... Oops.

26:48.735 --> 26:54.575
I think you're bluffing.
For you are a worse chicken.

26:54.700 --> 26:58.997
What? I'm not a chicken.
Take the ring. Just say yes.

26:59.163 --> 27:03.835
Is this how you treat a lady?

27:04.002 --> 27:05.921
Well no.

27:06.087 --> 27:12.761
What then, Katarina? Are you willing to
to bring the whole town in danger?

27:14.889 --> 27:17.016
You daren't.

27:17.183 --> 27:20.103
You understand
playing nasty, Victor.

27:20.311 --> 27:23.189
Katarina, if I may ask.

27:23.398 --> 27:25.608
All right, darling.

27:25.775 --> 27:29.988
Now I'll tell you why
you must accept the ring.

27:30.155 --> 27:36.829
- It better be good.
- Ring can smash all my weapons.

27:38.789 --> 27:44.921
Did you just  all  weapon?

27:45.088 --> 27:48.800
Victor? Victor, hold up.

28:00.938 --> 28:03.232
Yep, you too, Victor.

28:05.318 --> 28:07.529
What happened?

28:19.917 --> 28:25.715
Head size identified.
Safety system activated.

28:26.924 --> 28:30.845
VALENTIN ADMISSION
TODAY

28:34.057 --> 28:38.645
- I do not like this job.
- You do not do anything, sloths.

28:38.812 --> 28:41.941
When should we be heroes again?

28:42.107 --> 28:44.360
Today it should be.

28:44.527 --> 28:48.448
Johansen. Johansen!

28:48.614 --> 28:52.952
- Yes, sir. Plump?
- I told you to fix the ATM machine.

28:53.119 --> 28:57.749
If people can not withdraw money,
they can not spend money.

28:57.874 --> 29:02.171
- Sorry, I'll fix it.
- How hard can it be?

29:02.379 --> 29:06.926
Hello, my slut.
Chef, I mean. My boss.

29:07.093 --> 29:08.886
Hey darling.

29:09.053 --> 29:13.683
- Sorry about the surprise.
- Do not apologize.

29:13.850 --> 29:17.896
- Fix it.
- Okey-dokey.

29:18.021 --> 29:20.816
I also have
a surprise for you.

29:20.941 --> 29:26.781
- And I have a new one for you.
- Let's meet in the theme park in the evening.

29:26.906 --> 29:30.785
I would not miss it here,
if I were you.

29:30.910 --> 29:34.914
And one more thing:
I love you.

29:35.081 --> 29:39.044
- What did you say?
- I love my job.

29:39.211 --> 29:46.010
- It is the work I love.
- Enjoy it while you can.

29:46.176 --> 29:49.930
For you will soon be fired.

29:50.097 --> 29:52.266
- Pardon.
- I hate you.

29:58.231 --> 30:01.109
GIANT ROBOT
ALIGNMENT SYSTEM

30:05.113 --> 30:09.034
Load completed.
Even Mounting possible.

30:11.370 --> 30:14.499
I love being an evil genius.

30:14.665 --> 30:16.709
- Look, Dad.
- What now?

30:22.174 --> 30:25.218
It's just some clowns. Come on.

30:25.385 --> 30:32.476
Go with you. Secret weapon ready,
ring ready,  moi  ready.

30:32.643 --> 30:37.190
Everything is perfect, Victor. Let us...

30:40.193 --> 30:42.862
Then we go, Victor.

30:48.202 --> 30:51.747
- Hey, you two.
- Is it us, he's talking to?

30:51.914 --> 30:58.129
- I think.
- Fart on. We must not be discovered.

30:58.296 --> 31:01.966
- Hey.
- He still follows after us.

31:02.091 --> 31:05.136
Escape, Victor. Run. Run.

31:08.682 --> 31:10.893
What will you?

31:11.018 --> 31:14.939
I forgot your money in the machine.

31:16.148 --> 31:19.193
Hey, I've lost Sus' ring.

31:19.360 --> 31:22.655
A moment. It's my ring.

31:27.911 --> 31:30.956
- It is Sus' ring.
- No, this is my ring.

31:37.129 --> 31:42.176
- You are Oscar, super villain.
- Let me handle this.

31:42.343 --> 31:45.972
- Get him away.
- My ring! My ring!

31:54.398 --> 31:57.484
Is love so important?

32:03.241 --> 32:05.952
What happened?

32:06.077 --> 32:11.082
- The robot has stolen Sus' ring.
- There are certain needs heroes here.

32:11.249 --> 32:13.752
So we are moving forward, friends.

32:13.919 --> 32:19.258
- Who are they?
- I only know they are working for Oscar.

32:19.425 --> 32:24.680
- Do you think we can handle them?
- No choice. How can I like it.

32:31.938 --> 32:34.316
We are being persecuted.

32:34.483 --> 32:38.070
It is him the meddlesome kid.
Shake him off.

32:39.780 --> 32:41.907
Beware!

32:44.535 --> 32:46.370
It was close.

32:49.290 --> 32:51.209
- Turn!
- Okay.

32:54.796 --> 32:57.424
- Drive only.
- Stop!

32:59.051 --> 33:01.762
It's raining hotdogs.

33:03.138 --> 33:05.558
- Oh no!
- What do we do?

33:05.766 --> 33:07.310
Brems!

33:23.952 --> 33:27.790
- Hilmer!
- Thank you.

33:29.584 --> 33:31.252
Dont judge me.

33:31.419 --> 33:34.339
- You made it.
- I did?

33:39.010 --> 33:43.682
- They drop away.
- Take the shortcut.

33:51.482 --> 33:55.361
- Car chase is over.
- That was better.

33:55.528 --> 33:59.783
- Mads, you're just too tough.
- Yes I know.

33:59.950 --> 34:01.910
Beware!

34:08.876 --> 34:10.960
Without hands.

34:14.215 --> 34:16.259
I have been divorced.

34:17.217 --> 34:19.971
I am finished.

34:21.306 --> 34:23.809
What was it?

34:28.021 --> 34:30.440
Shake them off.

34:34.862 --> 34:38.241
- Stop screaming.
- Hit the ring.

34:42.829 --> 34:44.956
Do something.

34:47.542 --> 34:50.212
I hate that song.

34:51.338 --> 34:53.424
Then there is the chopped pork.

34:58.679 --> 35:00.431
EXPLOSIVE

35:01.266 --> 35:04.602
Can I cry now?
- I fly.

35:04.811 --> 35:08.273
- No, you fall, kvajnakke.
- I catch you.

35:19.577 --> 35:22.121
- Car chase ended.
- Great.

35:25.625 --> 35:28.169
Great lever.

35:30.505 --> 35:32.216
There he is.

35:39.390 --> 35:41.058
SKYBANE

35:54.615 --> 35:56.492
What the hell?

36:00.246 --> 36:04.959
- Your k?dhoved. What do you want?
- You have something that belongs to Mads.

36:05.126 --> 36:09.672
- Do you think my boss's ring?
- No, Sus' ring.

36:09.881 --> 36:12.509
I doubt it.

36:18.098 --> 36:20.518
It does not look good.

36:20.684 --> 36:24.939
We just let,
as though it is our entire show.

36:25.106 --> 36:26.774
Yep.

36:26.983 --> 36:29.611
Just come.

36:31.071 --> 36:33.031
Do you like it?

36:49.924 --> 36:51.676
Sus' ring.

36:55.180 --> 36:58.225
Take it, your slice of bacon.

37:04.190 --> 37:06.984
Do not look down.

37:08.027 --> 37:10.488
Do not look down.

37:13.825 --> 37:17.120
Hands off the ring.

37:17.245 --> 37:20.207
Do not listen to him, Mads.
He is the villain.

37:20.374 --> 37:24.670
If it should be on the way,
so say goodbye to the children.

37:30.218 --> 37:32.345
It is not good.

37:36.015 --> 37:38.810
- Stain, kids!
- I know.

37:53.493 --> 37:55.244
Thank you, monkey.

37:55.411 --> 37:57.455
- Run, Spot.
- What?

38:01.376 --> 38:03.462
It slides.

38:12.555 --> 38:15.141
Okra, create a bridge of bubbles.

38:24.860 --> 38:27.863
- Heroes.
- Thank you.

38:34.870 --> 38:39.459
I think I can ironing "play hero"
from my CV.

38:46.842 --> 38:51.388
- Mads, they got from us.
- Do not worry. See there.

38:51.513 --> 38:55.518
- When we are together, nothing is impossible.
- Exactly.

38:55.684 --> 39:00.022
See, it's X-9 biofuels.
It is produced in Düsseldorf.

39:00.189 --> 39:02.859
Hilmer, you can track it?

39:03.067 --> 39:05.236
- It sure could.
- Thank you.

39:17.375 --> 39:23.673
My poor Victor. Have you come
hurt? My dear, sweet robot.

39:26.885 --> 39:31.098
You are truly
my only friend, Victor.

39:36.937 --> 39:40.107
Victor! Give me the ring.

39:46.614 --> 39:48.950
There's the well.

39:49.159 --> 39:53.789
- I need help.
- We all have our own needs.

39:53.956 --> 39:58.627
However, with this ring I'll soon all
what I need.

40:01.672 --> 40:03.591
I...

40:20.693 --> 40:23.237
Find them, my friend.

40:35.876 --> 40:39.755
- Hilmer, what's the code?
- Snout magic.

40:42.258 --> 40:44.927
36 ... 24 ... 36th

40:48.431 --> 40:52.227
- Checked.
- Robots.

40:56.481 --> 41:01.236
- Mission: very possible.
- Okra ... James Okra.

41:01.403 --> 41:04.531
- Friends, that is.
- Pardon.

41:07.910 --> 41:10.413
Frankly.

41:14.417 --> 41:17.587
- Mads?
- What?

41:18.755 --> 41:22.259
I picked up the stench of villains.

41:22.426 --> 41:28.432
- Someone's coming.
- Save you. Not good.

41:28.557 --> 41:30.851
Find a different location.

41:32.437 --> 41:36.524
Victor, Victor, Victor!
I can not stand his shape.

41:36.691 --> 41:41.780
When I was married to Katarina,
I melt him into a teapot.

41:51.874 --> 41:54.252
Victor.

42:09.018 --> 42:13.314
- It is Sus' ring.
- So let's get to it.

42:18.861 --> 42:20.905
Plan B?

42:21.072 --> 42:24.159
- Somebody in there.
- But who?

42:24.367 --> 42:29.373
Well, me. I want
I do it. Thanks for the help.

42:36.172 --> 42:40.009
Take care, Mads. Do not touch the floor.
Do not touch the wall.

42:40.176 --> 42:44.890
- Do not touch that which dims.
- Fold now quays.

42:47.601 --> 42:52.398
I have it. Or maybe not.
Has it almost. No.

43:06.705 --> 43:08.999
Mads! Hurry up.

43:23.598 --> 43:25.934
I made it.

43:30.313 --> 43:31.690
Mads!

43:35.319 --> 43:40.366
Inept robot.
Get my ring back.

43:40.533 --> 43:46.164
Do battle robots ready.
They'll pay for this with their lives.

43:59.511 --> 44:03.849
Wow, a TL-682-hike ball.

44:06.686 --> 44:08.438
How cool.

44:09.647 --> 44:13.902
-  Welcome.
- Grease. Here we go.

44:16.238 --> 44:19.450
- Mads!
- Mads, where are you?

44:20.743 --> 44:24.872
- It's a big ring.
- Wait, that's not Mads' ring.

44:24.997 --> 44:28.960
Never mind if the ring is.
Let's just give Mads it.

44:29.127 --> 44:32.922
- But it's not working.
- Mads should have it.

44:46.896 --> 44:49.899
Okra, what's wrong with you?

44:50.066 --> 44:53.945
Nothing. The Oscars ring, right?

44:54.112 --> 44:59.326
Oscar is a super villain.
He probably even stolen it.

44:59.534 --> 45:05.875
- It is always wrong to steal.
- Friends? Helps me right?

45:30.651 --> 45:33.446
Give me the ring, otherwise ...

45:41.371 --> 45:43.749
- Take it.
- What are you doing?

45:43.916 --> 45:45.793
Fools. What ...?

46:04.563 --> 46:06.398
The ring!

46:07.983 --> 46:09.985
Fire!

46:20.371 --> 46:22.582
I'm coming, friends.

46:45.690 --> 46:48.944
It's good to see you.

46:49.069 --> 46:55.159
If Mads get the ring, says Sus "yes"
for him. Then we can keep the show.

46:55.326 --> 46:59.163
- And we are heroes. Give him the ring.
- But it's wrong.

47:02.458 --> 47:06.171
I just want to hear Sus say "yes"
for courtship. Nothing else.

47:08.298 --> 47:10.842
You are the best robot friends.

47:16.724 --> 47:19.852
What happened?

47:19.977 --> 47:22.355
Oh no. Hilmer!

47:38.622 --> 47:41.375
Give me the ring.

48:00.145 --> 48:04.233
- These are my friends.
- Friends? Impressive.

48:10.949 --> 48:14.077
- Mads!
- Is it really Mads?

48:14.202 --> 48:18.248
- Mads?
- Yes, Mads Johansen.

48:23.546 --> 48:27.425
- Now give me the ring.
- No I will not.

48:28.885 --> 48:30.803
Never.

48:37.227 --> 48:40.731
I can run away,
but not save you.

48:45.403 --> 48:49.365
Finally. An output.
We must get hold of the ladder.

48:49.532 --> 48:52.076
Let us then come home.

48:56.957 --> 49:00.168
I was about to forget the ring.

49:03.297 --> 49:06.675
How could I forget Sus' ring?

49:09.971 --> 49:16.186
- I almost feel sorry for you idiots.
- It's called "idols".

49:16.352 --> 49:19.981
- Get the ladder, Mads.
- Okay.

49:29.950 --> 49:33.204
On labels, ladies.

49:37.375 --> 49:40.462
Let's get away.

49:40.629 --> 49:41.922
Oh no.

49:52.266 --> 49:54.227
Fire!

50:00.942 --> 50:04.529
- Mads!
- What do we do? We're trapped.

50:04.738 --> 50:06.490
Hilmer!

50:15.374 --> 50:20.964
- Connector of Mads. We manage Victor.
- I can not leave you in the lurch.

50:21.131 --> 50:25.969
Come on. Valentine's Day is soon over.
We'll be all right.

50:26.928 --> 50:29.097
Hey!

50:30.182 --> 50:33.227
You got the ring. Now you need to have the girl.

50:33.352 --> 50:36.647
And whatever happens,
so to her.

50:36.856 --> 50:41.236
Watch out for yourselves.
I need you for the wedding.

51:12.311 --> 51:17.107
You have come into my black book, Mads.

51:19.568 --> 51:23.364
- Did you get my ring?
- As you gave me instructions.

51:23.531 --> 51:30.205
Hit it. Now we can finally
go ahead with the plan.

51:36.253 --> 51:38.505
Open the door.

51:48.975 --> 51:51.853
What a glorious moment.

51:52.020 --> 51:55.524
Robots forward with flags.

52:00.362 --> 52:03.366
So we go to the theme park.

52:06.202 --> 52:11.040
We must tell Mads,
the fun will smash everything.

52:11.207 --> 52:13.418
Can you find him?

52:13.585 --> 52:16.129
Snout magic.

52:25.056 --> 52:27.350
Are they in the parade?

52:30.144 --> 52:33.398
Stay alive, friends,
so I will deliver the show.

52:38.987 --> 52:44.076
- Free Just.
- Free now. Free now.

52:44.243 --> 52:47.204
Freedom Now. Free now.

52:47.371 --> 52:52.001
There has passed 20 years.
How long should I wait?

53:35.006 --> 53:40.011
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine. Thanks.

53:47.144 --> 53:52.274
- Sus, I want to ask you something.
- What is it, Mads?

53:59.073 --> 54:00.992
Sus.

54:04.996 --> 54:07.332
My Goodness.

54:07.499 --> 54:10.669
Wow, look at how big the ring is.

54:12.338 --> 54:16.843
Wait. What's Mads?
Is there something wrong?

54:19.178 --> 54:23.266
I can not.
I'm sorry, but it is wrong.

54:23.433 --> 54:26.353
What did he say?

54:26.478 --> 54:28.897
Reach...

54:30.482 --> 54:32.943
If that is how you feel.

54:34.320 --> 54:37.782
I leave town
my reportage.

54:37.949 --> 54:40.368
Where are you going?

54:40.535 --> 54:43.538
I said yes to a job in London.

54:43.663 --> 54:47.709
London? But it's so far away.

54:47.876 --> 54:52.297
It does not have to wait for anything,
that never happens.

54:55.467 --> 55:00.848
- Have a good life, Mads.
- Sus, now let be.

55:03.768 --> 55:06.104
Goodbye.

55:10.275 --> 55:14.446
It must feel nice
to be super villain again.

55:14.571 --> 55:18.826
It evokes wonderful memories.
But only for a while.

55:18.993 --> 55:21.996
Of course. The wedding.

55:22.205 --> 55:27.293
Today is the happiest day
in my life.

55:28.628 --> 55:33.675
I'm sorry to ask, but why
you will give up everything for Katarina?

55:35.886 --> 55:42.143
I give nothing for her.
On the contrary, in fact.

55:42.310 --> 55:46.898
- All I have caused her.
- I do not understand.

55:48.399 --> 55:52.195
I've loved Katarina very long.

55:52.362 --> 55:57.367
It is because of her,
I have become who I am today.

55:59.161 --> 56:04.875
She asked me to keep me away from her.
I did not meet her demands.

56:05.042 --> 56:08.421
So I had to love her
at a distance.

56:08.588 --> 56:11.549
She was so beautiful.

56:12.634 --> 56:17.222
One must be a great man for
to marry a Kastanjenborg.

56:17.389 --> 56:21.393
And great men gives only large rings.

56:27.233 --> 56:33.156
Just wait and see, Katarina.
I'll be a great man.

56:39.371 --> 56:45.169
So you were just super villain
to impress Katarina?

56:45.336 --> 56:50.341
Exactly. So you can thank her for,
that you even exist.

56:50.508 --> 56:55.346
And with this ring she can do,
you do not exist.

56:56.640 --> 57:02.688
Wake up. You have devoted your life to
to force the world to its knees.

57:02.813 --> 57:08.611
- You live and breathe evil.
- Victor, you make me afraid.

57:08.736 --> 57:13.324
And now you want to give it all up?
That I can not agree to.

57:13.491 --> 57:19.331
I want you again leads the way
in a diabolical, destructive plan.

57:19.497 --> 57:24.920
- I want my Oscar back.
- Driver, stop the car.

57:27.423 --> 57:29.383
Get out.

57:29.550 --> 57:35.723
- Pardon? You're doing just nonsense, right?
- Out!

57:41.980 --> 57:44.691
That can not be true.

57:46.318 --> 57:49.780
After everything I've done for you.

57:59.541 --> 58:03.753
Who is this I see?
The bad boy.

58:19.938 --> 58:23.316
We can not continue to meet
thus.

58:23.483 --> 58:25.527
Here, take it.

58:29.156 --> 58:32.868
I can hardly believe my luck.

58:34.537 --> 58:38.541
- What was that?
- For the greatest gift in the world.

58:45.173 --> 58:48.552
See you later, kid.

58:53.182 --> 58:55.225
Sus ... Sus.

59:07.614 --> 59:10.951
I have three minutes
before my big speech.

59:11.118 --> 59:14.872
- Let's clear the interview quickly.
- Yeah okay.

59:15.038 --> 59:19.084
- Is there something wrong?
- I'm fine.

59:20.169 --> 59:27.010
Mayor, Valentine's parade draws
to be a great success.

59:27.177 --> 59:31.348
It must be said, Sus.
And I would like to thank all ...

59:31.515 --> 59:38.272
- Katarina, my love.
- Or not all. Guards stop him.

59:39.815 --> 59:45.863
- Listen to me for once.
- Why would I?

59:46.030 --> 59:51.620
- Otherwise, you will regret it.
- What are you talking about Oscar?

59:51.786 --> 59:55.707
I talk about it here.

59:55.874 --> 59:58.585
What?
It is not my ring.

59:58.752 --> 01:00:02.173
- Guards!
- But Katarina, listen ...

01:00:04.925 --> 01:00:07.720
Victor, it's the wrong ring.

01:00:07.887 --> 01:00:14.394
Pardon.
You mean this ring?

01:00:34.582 --> 01:00:39.004
- What are you now doing?
- Take rather against my ring.

01:00:39.171 --> 01:00:43.634
otherwise smashes
the great Oscar-robot city.

01:00:52.435 --> 01:00:55.688
Victor, give me the ring.

01:00:58.441 --> 01:01:01.653
Have you gone crazy?
What are you doing?

01:01:02.529 --> 01:01:07.618
I do, you have built me.
I behave myself hurt.

01:01:07.785 --> 01:01:12.039
Your dolt.
Give it to me before I melt you.

01:01:12.206 --> 01:01:17.045
- First let me polish it for you.
- Stop! What are you doing?

01:01:17.212 --> 01:01:22.342
Oops.
Diamonds are obviously not forever.

01:01:22.551 --> 01:01:25.262
My ring! My ring!

01:01:38.943 --> 01:01:44.700
Listen. From now on Valentine's Day
be known as the day -

01:01:44.866 --> 01:01:50.623
- I, Victor,
destroyed your city forever.

01:01:59.757 --> 01:02:01.009
Fire!

01:02:11.520 --> 01:02:15.816
Oscar, tell me right now:
How do we stop it?

01:02:15.983 --> 01:02:19.779
It should be a beautiful celebration.

01:02:21.030 --> 01:02:24.409
The robot, Oscar.
How do we turn off it?

01:02:24.618 --> 01:02:28.747
It can not,
Victor has crushed the ring.

01:02:28.914 --> 01:02:33.836
But if you stop Victor,
you can stop the robot -

01:02:34.003 --> 01:02:37.548
- The associated
via motion control.

01:02:37.715 --> 01:02:40.968
- Come with me. I have an idea.
- Where are you going?

01:03:00.072 --> 01:03:02.074
Jack, film it.

01:03:04.452 --> 01:03:11.293
Latest news: Chaos in the theme park.
Sus Kastanjenborg report.

01:03:11.460 --> 01:03:18.092
A giant robot is just surfaced.
It crushes everything in its path.

01:03:18.259 --> 01:03:21.971
If it is not stopped,
The whole town can be at risk.

01:03:22.096 --> 01:03:24.599
Sus, beware!

01:03:24.766 --> 01:03:28.853
No,
who can stop this madness?

01:03:32.357 --> 01:03:38.405
- How long should I wait?
- Great men gives only large rings.

01:03:38.614 --> 01:03:43.661
No, Katarina. It's not
on the ring. It's about me.

01:03:51.127 --> 01:03:55.257
We've just heard,
the Oscars henchman, Victor, -

01:03:55.424 --> 01:03:59.803
- controls the robot
with some kind of motion control.

01:04:01.472 --> 01:04:07.353
Oh no, the robot is moving toward the city.
Several million people are at risk.

01:04:07.520 --> 01:04:12.108
It's terrible.
No one can apparently stop it.

01:04:13.568 --> 01:04:16.238
It's funny it here.

01:04:30.128 --> 01:04:31.462
Sus!

01:04:38.094 --> 01:04:41.223
Finished with the bad boy.

01:04:46.353 --> 01:04:49.273
Come, Sus. We must leave.

01:04:49.440 --> 01:04:53.111
I can handle this.
Wait.

01:04:53.236 --> 01:04:55.572
"Wait"?

01:05:00.243 --> 01:05:04.540
I am tired of waiting, Mads.
There has passed 20 years.

01:05:06.208 --> 01:05:11.047
Fair enough. I should have asked you
anything before, but ...

01:05:11.213 --> 01:05:14.717
I wanted,
it had to be something big.

01:05:22.100 --> 01:05:25.771
I know,
it is not just the time.

01:05:25.938 --> 01:05:29.149
But it is perhaps my last chance.

01:05:29.275 --> 01:05:34.363
I've made a fool of me, every time I have
tried to ask you, but ...

01:05:34.530 --> 01:05:37.867
I was afraid.

01:05:38.034 --> 01:05:40.120
I was nervous.

01:05:40.286 --> 01:05:46.668
I thought I should give you
a large courtship, a huge ring.

01:05:46.877 --> 01:05:51.215
But that is not it,
for so I am not.

01:05:52.925 --> 01:05:58.473
Sus.
I love you more than life.

01:06:01.184 --> 01:06:06.440
So there is probably no other
to say than ...

01:06:08.400 --> 01:06:13.280
- Sus Kastanjenborg.
- It's just so pathetic.

01:06:14.448 --> 01:06:17.410
Will you...
Sus!

01:06:18.870 --> 01:06:20.330
Mads!

01:06:22.290 --> 01:06:24.042
Not again.

01:06:27.170 --> 01:06:31.425
All that love makes me sick.

01:06:31.592 --> 01:06:35.721
From now on, we celebrate
Saint Victors today.

01:06:35.930 --> 01:06:39.308
With total destruction!

01:06:42.812 --> 01:06:46.024
- Hello friends.
- Good to see you again, Mads.

01:06:46.191 --> 01:06:50.821
- Push, Mads, push.
- Sad creatures.

01:07:08.965 --> 01:07:15.848
- Are you alive?
- I will not die. I am too young.

01:07:16.014 --> 01:07:22.563
Mads, where are you?
Come out and play.

01:07:22.730 --> 01:07:26.776
I think I can save Sus,
but I will need your help.

01:07:29.571 --> 01:07:33.700
- Follow the Plan.
- I got you now.

01:07:36.537 --> 01:07:42.585
Should that be true love?
Your beloved flees.

01:07:42.752 --> 01:07:45.505
So real is love.

01:07:55.515 --> 01:07:56.933
Heroes!

01:08:06.319 --> 01:08:08.529
This way.

01:08:21.001 --> 01:08:22.377
What?

01:08:25.296 --> 01:08:28.259
WOULD YOU MARRIED YOU WITH ME VICTOR?

01:08:31.763 --> 01:08:35.183
I hate marriage.

01:08:38.435 --> 01:08:42.649
- What's wrong? Give los.
- I am nervous.

01:08:42.816 --> 01:08:45.819
What unsavory creatures.

01:08:55.830 --> 01:08:59.376
- Hurry up.
- Think of a big, greasy hotdog.

01:09:01.377 --> 01:09:07.843
Where mega obnoxious.
Okay, Plet. Here it comes.

01:09:11.305 --> 01:09:12.682
Add.

01:09:14.015 --> 01:09:19.856
Warning. Poison gas discovered.
Entrepreneur cleansing plan Alpha.

01:09:20.982 --> 01:09:26.154
Well done, heroes.
I can handle it.

01:09:30.826 --> 01:09:33.662
- Sus.
- Mads.

01:09:36.499 --> 01:09:38.501
Watch out behind you.

01:09:38.667 --> 01:09:42.589
Quickly. motion control
controls the giant robot.

01:09:42.756 --> 01:09:45.509
I check on it.

01:09:52.224 --> 01:09:54.143
Mads ...

01:09:57.271 --> 01:10:00.233
Leg, you are a edderkopabe.

01:10:00.400 --> 01:10:05.071
Come on. Spider Monkeys climbs
faster than that.

01:10:14.456 --> 01:10:16.834
Mads!

01:10:17.043 --> 01:10:19.212
Do you already?

01:10:21.381 --> 01:10:23.925
- No, Mads!
- Take the helm.

01:10:24.134 --> 01:10:26.219
No. What about you?

01:10:28.930 --> 01:10:32.059
Do not worry. I follow.

01:10:32.226 --> 01:10:34.603
No, Mads!

01:10:41.319 --> 01:10:45.615
I splitter robots as you ad
for breakfast.

01:10:45.782 --> 01:10:50.537
Jas?? And I smash people
like you for lunch.

01:10:51.663 --> 01:10:53.332
Like this?

01:10:57.795 --> 01:11:00.840
- It is little funny.
- Very funny, really.

01:11:06.304 --> 01:11:07.847
Stop.

01:11:23.030 --> 01:11:25.616
Fireworks. Juhu.

01:11:27.660 --> 01:11:30.622
I love you, Sus.

01:11:42.051 --> 01:11:47.306
Forget it.
Now get out with you.

01:11:54.648 --> 01:11:58.610
Now nothing can stop me.

01:12:11.249 --> 01:12:13.835
- Mads!
- Oh no.

01:12:43.617 --> 01:12:46.745
- Oscar.
-  I love you. I love you.

01:12:55.964 --> 01:13:02.554
- Guards, apprehend the man.
- No no. Let it go. Let it go.

01:13:04.556 --> 01:13:08.018
I was a great man for your sake.

01:13:08.227 --> 01:13:11.814
No, Oscar. You were a great villain.

01:13:11.981 --> 01:13:16.319
But I would go straight,
if you married me.

01:13:16.486 --> 01:13:20.699
Your problem is that you do not know
what love is.

01:13:20.824 --> 01:13:23.869
- Do you know when it?
- Let's go.

01:13:24.036 --> 01:13:30.668
Call me, okay?
Katarina, I love you.

01:13:30.793 --> 01:13:37.258
Mads Johansen, think that I am saying
it here, but you are a great man.

01:13:38.801 --> 01:13:40.303
Thanks.

01:13:40.470 --> 01:13:44.141
Johansen, you've outdone yourself
This time.

01:13:44.349 --> 01:13:49.104
My park is completely destroyed.
It is smashed.

01:13:49.980 --> 01:13:54.193
Then it heltetid, Mads.
Do the right thing.

01:13:59.449 --> 01:14:01.284
Okay.

01:14:18.761 --> 01:14:23.600
Honey, I have something in hand.
Do you know what it is?

01:14:24.642 --> 01:14:29.064
I've been wanting to ask
this issue for 20 years.

01:14:29.231 --> 01:14:33.318
Sus Kastanjenborg.
Will you marry me?

01:14:33.485 --> 01:14:35.321
Sam.

01:15:07.897 --> 01:15:09.190
Yes.

01:15:12.611 --> 01:15:17.908
- It does not, I'm just saying.
- Should we bet, Fister?

01:15:18.075 --> 01:15:20.619
- Super.
- Jubi.

01:15:25.625 --> 01:15:29.671
Get out. This boat is busy.

01:15:36.511 --> 01:15:38.305
What is it?

01:15:38.514 --> 01:15:42.226
Well, it? It's just something
I found among the rubble.

01:15:42.434 --> 01:15:46.898
Jas?? My name is on it.

01:15:48.900 --> 01:15:51.236
I love you so much.
