00:39.430 --> 00:40.649
Go!

00:40.692 --> 00:41.606
I'm sorry.

01:42.363 --> 01:43.712
Really?

01:43.755 --> 01:45.627
Watch it, man.

01:45.670 --> 01:47.629
Yeah, you better keep walking.

01:47.672 --> 01:48.673
Okay, tool.

02:13.829 --> 02:14.569
Hello?

02:17.659 --> 02:19.965
Look, I don't have
any money to pay you.

02:20.009 --> 02:21.489
I'm sor...

02:21.532 --> 02:23.447
Look, I know what
I said last week,

02:23.491 --> 02:26.015
but things are really
tight here right now.

02:26.058 --> 02:27.364
Can I just pay you next week?

02:27.408 --> 02:28.191
Mom?

02:28.235 --> 02:29.584
Please?

02:29.627 --> 02:31.194
Hey, hey, listen, I have to go.

02:31.238 --> 02:32.021
I'm sorry.

02:32.064 --> 02:33.196
Next week.

02:33.240 --> 02:34.110
Hey, mom.

02:35.459 --> 02:37.157
We need some cash for the pool.

02:37.200 --> 02:40.682
Hey, get out of there
and zip me up, please.

02:40.725 --> 02:43.163
Okay, but I still
need cash for the pool.

02:43.206 --> 02:44.251
Hey, guys.

02:44.294 --> 02:46.078
I gave you five yesterday.

02:46.122 --> 02:47.471
Yeah, which is enough to get in,

02:47.515 --> 02:49.212
but it's not enough
if we want food

02:49.256 --> 02:50.605
or drinks.

02:50.648 --> 02:51.867
We could go to the lake,

02:51.910 --> 02:53.347
because that's free.

02:53.390 --> 02:55.566
No, it's dangerous
and unsupervised.

02:55.610 --> 02:58.221
I want some food, mom, please.

02:58.265 --> 02:59.701
I'm sorry, I'm out of cash.

02:59.744 --> 03:01.137
Eat before you go.

03:02.791 --> 03:03.966
Sorry.

03:05.010 --> 03:05.837
That's Richard.

03:05.881 --> 03:07.448
I'll get it.

03:07.491 --> 03:08.231
So...

03:12.931 --> 03:14.716
Where's he sweeping
you away to this time?

03:14.759 --> 03:16.935
An afternoon concert
at the Philharmonic

03:16.979 --> 03:18.807
and then dinner tonight.

03:18.850 --> 03:20.200
He won't tell me where.

03:20.243 --> 03:21.418
And then next week
he's taking us

03:21.462 --> 03:22.637
all to a ball game.

03:22.680 --> 03:23.420
Oh.

03:24.595 --> 03:25.335
Great.

03:27.250 --> 03:29.209
Look, Maggie,
he's really nervous

03:29.252 --> 03:30.862
about hanging out with
you and your sister,

03:30.906 --> 03:32.908
so he just picked
something that he thought

03:32.951 --> 03:34.518
you would like.

03:34.562 --> 03:36.433
Baseball's not the problem.

03:36.477 --> 03:38.479
I'm sorry, I know that I haven't

03:38.522 --> 03:40.611
been very available
for you guys.

03:40.655 --> 03:41.786
But

03:41.830 --> 03:43.353
I need this.

03:43.397 --> 03:45.268
I haven't dated in, like,

03:45.312 --> 03:46.269
10 years.

03:46.313 --> 03:48.010
What about Justin?

03:48.053 --> 03:49.707
Hardly dating.

03:49.751 --> 03:51.231
I mean, he was
remodeling the house.

03:51.274 --> 03:52.710
Yeah, but you went out with him.

03:52.754 --> 03:56.714
Well, just so he would
stop overcharging me.

03:56.758 --> 03:58.063
Can I take the car to the pool?

03:58.107 --> 03:59.674
Yes.

03:59.717 --> 04:01.066
No kids in the car.

04:01.110 --> 04:02.024
Of course.

04:07.116 --> 04:10.337
Now this is a limited
edition 1984 Roger Clemens

04:10.380 --> 04:11.251
rookie card.

04:13.122 --> 04:13.905
Wow.

04:13.949 --> 04:15.429
Yeah.

04:15.472 --> 04:16.995
I picked it up at
a show yesterday.

04:17.039 --> 04:18.692
Now that's easily
worth $500 and if you

04:18.736 --> 04:20.651
hold onto it, for
say, I don't know,

04:20.695 --> 04:22.740
like, 10 years, it'll
be worth triple that.

04:22.784 --> 04:25.439
Maybe even five times as much.

04:25.482 --> 04:27.267
That's for both of you.

04:27.310 --> 04:28.572
Who's Roger Clemens?

04:28.616 --> 04:30.531
Who's Roger Clemens.

04:30.574 --> 04:31.314
Hey, beautiful.

04:31.358 --> 04:33.055
Hi.

04:33.098 --> 04:33.925
I can't believe
your girls don't know

04:33.969 --> 04:35.492
who Roger Clemens is.

04:35.536 --> 04:37.146
Well, we're more
of a football family.

04:37.189 --> 04:39.148
Oh, mom, you need to
sign my permission slip,

04:39.191 --> 04:40.715
otherwise they won't
let me into the pool.

04:40.758 --> 04:43.108
All right, hold on a second.

04:44.675 --> 04:47.374
So, you guys are
going to the pool, huh?

04:47.417 --> 04:48.853
Yeah.

04:48.897 --> 04:50.202
Oh yeah, 'cause

04:52.422 --> 04:53.771
I saw a few of your
friends heading

04:53.815 --> 04:55.077
towards the lake.

04:58.254 --> 04:59.864
Yeah.

04:59.908 --> 05:01.910
It's okay, I got your back.

05:03.738 --> 05:05.740
I won't tell if you won't.

05:06.958 --> 05:07.742
Okay.

05:09.178 --> 05:09.918
Hey.

05:11.876 --> 05:13.530
See you later.

05:15.402 --> 05:16.141
See ya.

05:20.798 --> 05:21.973
Five bucks is not
gonna be enough.

05:22.017 --> 05:22.974
No, really?

05:24.759 --> 05:26.369
We could sell this.

05:26.413 --> 05:28.153
I like that idea.

05:31.374 --> 05:33.028
What a liar.

05:33.071 --> 05:36.379
It's totally worth 500,
maybe even double that.

05:36.423 --> 05:38.207
Well, how much is it?

05:39.164 --> 05:40.601
A lousy 50 bucks.

05:41.906 --> 05:42.733
Split it.

05:45.693 --> 05:49.697
<i>♪ Through all I
have seen so much ♪</i>

05:52.395 --> 05:55.877
<i>♪ And now the memories fade ♪</i>

06:11.327 --> 06:12.676
If mom ever finds
out that we're not

06:12.720 --> 06:15.331
at the pool, we're DEA

06:15.375 --> 06:16.680
All my friends go to the pool.

06:16.724 --> 06:18.334
Yeah, but none
of mine do and I'm

06:18.378 --> 06:20.031
kinda sick of hanging
out with little kids.

06:20.075 --> 06:21.946
I'm not a little kid.

06:21.990 --> 06:24.340
Besides, you're
only here for Tony.

06:24.384 --> 06:25.820
Am not.

06:25.863 --> 06:26.603
Mm-hmm.

06:39.311 --> 06:42.227
You think I'll pop
out as fast as you?

06:45.013 --> 06:46.188
Hey.
Hi.

06:46.231 --> 06:47.363
Hi.

06:47.407 --> 06:48.320
I wish you...

06:48.364 --> 06:49.539
No, I can't.

06:49.583 --> 06:50.671
Lizzie's here.

06:52.673 --> 06:53.543
I'm serious.

06:55.240 --> 06:57.242
You know I'm not
supposed to be dating.

06:57.286 --> 06:59.419
Who says that we're dating?

07:02.378 --> 07:03.118
Cool it.

07:04.467 --> 07:06.121
Hey, Maggie.

07:10.430 --> 07:11.256
Thank you.

07:11.300 --> 07:12.519
You're welcome.

07:13.737 --> 07:15.217
What's her problem?

07:16.479 --> 07:18.655
She's mad at my mom.

07:18.699 --> 07:20.352
This is the first summer
we've stayed home.

07:20.396 --> 07:22.529
Usually we're
camping or traveling

07:22.572 --> 07:24.618
or something, but my mom's been

07:24.661 --> 07:26.837
all wrapped up in Richard.

07:26.881 --> 07:28.709
Richard, who's he?

07:28.752 --> 07:30.275
I don't know, he's
this guy that owns

07:30.319 --> 07:31.189
a pawn shop.

07:32.930 --> 07:34.584
But anyways, my mom's
been going out with him

07:34.628 --> 07:36.934
and leaving us home
alone all the time.

07:36.978 --> 07:38.501
And you're not using
that to get it on

07:38.545 --> 07:39.633
with Tony?

07:39.676 --> 07:42.200
You're nuts, he's hot.

07:42.244 --> 07:43.941
Shut up, he's right there.

07:46.335 --> 07:47.249
Hey, guys.

07:47.292 --> 07:48.076
Hey.
Hey.

07:56.954 --> 07:59.653
So Peg, will you
please marry me?

08:02.177 --> 08:03.787
Richard, I...

08:03.831 --> 08:05.746
Is that a yes?

08:05.789 --> 08:07.269
No.

08:07.312 --> 08:09.663
I mean, I'm sorry, nobody's ever

08:09.706 --> 08:11.578
proposed to me before.

08:11.621 --> 08:13.754
What about the girls' father?

08:13.797 --> 08:15.756
Well, he always
promised he would marry me

08:15.799 --> 08:18.454
but he died two weeks
after Lizzie was born.

08:18.498 --> 08:20.412
I'm sorry, I just
don't talk about him.

08:20.456 --> 08:22.284
I promise to take care of you,

08:22.327 --> 08:23.503
and your girls.

08:26.680 --> 08:29.944
Come on, don't leave
me hanging down here.

08:31.119 --> 08:31.902
Yes.

08:31.946 --> 08:32.729
Yes?

08:32.773 --> 08:33.556
Yes.

08:33.600 --> 08:34.426
Yes.

08:34.470 --> 08:35.210
All right.

08:38.082 --> 08:38.909
Here we go.

08:40.607 --> 08:42.696
Oh, baby, it's beautiful.

08:45.612 --> 08:47.483
Oh, what am I gonna
tell the girls?

08:47.527 --> 08:49.137
Well, that they
have a new daddy.

08:50.747 --> 08:52.706
Yeah, that'll sink
faster than the Titanic.

08:52.749 --> 08:54.925
I'm actually more worried
about you than them.

08:54.969 --> 08:58.581
How can I not like
any child of yours?

08:58.625 --> 09:00.714
Well, you've
never been a father.

09:00.757 --> 09:02.193
Oh, and teenagers.

09:02.237 --> 09:03.368
Maggie's starting
her senior year

09:03.412 --> 09:04.892
and she's already a handful.

09:04.935 --> 09:06.589
I coached girls
softball, so I know

09:06.633 --> 09:08.983
all about boy
crushes and hormones.

09:09.026 --> 09:09.853
Oh, really?

09:09.897 --> 09:11.072
Mm-hmm.

09:11.115 --> 09:12.682
Well, Maggie plays softball.

09:12.726 --> 09:14.249
See?

09:14.292 --> 09:15.946
We already have
something in common.

09:15.990 --> 09:19.820
And, you won't have to
raise the kids alone.

09:19.863 --> 09:23.258
I've always wanted
a partner in my life.

09:23.301 --> 09:24.564
Thank you.

09:24.607 --> 09:25.869
I love you.

09:25.913 --> 09:26.870
I love you.

09:31.483 --> 09:32.876
Come on, let me in.

09:32.920 --> 09:34.269
I can't, no, my mom's not home.

09:34.312 --> 09:36.314
It's even better.

09:39.448 --> 09:42.233
Okay, okay, you
really have to go.

09:42.277 --> 09:43.844
But...

09:43.887 --> 09:44.584
Bye.

10:07.737 --> 10:10.697
Hey, Maggie, can
I borrow your iPad?

10:10.740 --> 10:12.960
Can you believe
mom's not home yet?

10:13.003 --> 10:14.657
Yes, she likes him.

10:14.701 --> 10:16.920
No, she's being weird.

10:16.964 --> 10:18.182
No she's not.

10:18.226 --> 10:19.836
She's trying to be happy.

10:19.880 --> 10:21.011
What's wrong with that?

10:21.055 --> 10:22.534
Well, it's stupid, you know?

10:22.578 --> 10:23.535
She should be herself
because that's

10:23.579 --> 10:24.711
what she's always telling us to.

10:24.754 --> 10:25.799
Hey, come here.

10:26.974 --> 10:28.105
Goodnight, sweetie.

10:28.149 --> 10:29.367
Ew.

10:29.411 --> 10:31.543
I think I'm gonna throw up.

10:32.719 --> 10:34.808
Let's go talk to her.

10:34.851 --> 10:36.026
Mom, we need to

10:37.637 --> 10:38.376
talk.

10:39.943 --> 10:40.727
Sit down.

10:43.077 --> 10:46.341
It went really well
this afternoon,

10:46.384 --> 10:47.734
this evening.

10:47.777 --> 10:48.560
Tonight.

10:49.866 --> 10:50.650
Dinner.

10:52.956 --> 10:55.611
You girls like Richard, right?

10:55.655 --> 10:57.657
I mean, what's not to like?

10:57.700 --> 11:01.530
I mean, he's handsome,
he's well off,

11:01.573 --> 11:05.839
he's a really good man,
and he's well-mannered.

11:05.882 --> 11:08.319
And you know he used to
coach girls softball, right?

11:08.363 --> 11:10.670
He's great, mom.

11:10.713 --> 11:13.194
I'm so glad that you like him.

11:17.720 --> 11:18.634
What's wrong?

11:22.856 --> 11:24.248
He proposed to me.

11:25.902 --> 11:27.382
Can you believe it?

11:28.426 --> 11:29.732
And you said yes?

11:29.776 --> 11:31.386
Yes.

11:31.429 --> 11:33.257
He's such a nice guy
and he's gonna take

11:33.301 --> 11:35.042
such good care of me.

11:35.085 --> 11:35.825
And you.

11:36.913 --> 11:38.132
All of us.

11:38.175 --> 11:39.568
Well that's great, mom.

11:39.611 --> 11:40.264
You know, we had
a really good time

11:40.308 --> 11:41.178
at the pool.

11:47.663 --> 11:49.273
Mom, are you happy?

11:52.450 --> 11:53.930
Yes, Lizzie.

11:53.974 --> 11:54.714
Very much.

11:56.324 --> 11:57.064
Come here.

12:03.548 --> 12:04.288
Maggie.

12:05.420 --> 12:06.464
Maggie.

12:06.508 --> 12:08.031
What?

12:08.075 --> 12:09.816
Have you ever
seen mom that happy?

12:09.859 --> 12:11.034
She's drunk.

12:11.078 --> 12:12.427
I guess he's not that bad.

12:12.470 --> 12:14.472
And engaged isn't married.

12:16.170 --> 12:17.475
Yeah, but what'll happen
if they do get married?

12:17.519 --> 12:18.955
So what?

12:18.999 --> 12:20.565
He works in the
city which is, like,

12:20.609 --> 12:22.959
an hour away, so we'd
hardly even see him.

12:23.003 --> 12:25.309
That's what you think, huh?

12:26.441 --> 12:27.790
Nope.

12:27.834 --> 12:29.661
Either he's moving in with us,

12:29.705 --> 12:31.794
or we're going to
move in with him,

12:31.838 --> 12:34.841
because that is the way
that marriage works.

12:39.367 --> 12:40.803
Oh no.

12:40.847 --> 12:43.545
I hope she gets over him soon.

12:43.588 --> 12:44.764
Girls.

12:44.807 --> 12:46.243
Oh, Lizzie, there you are.

12:46.287 --> 12:47.027
Maggie.

12:48.289 --> 12:49.812
What?

12:49.856 --> 12:51.379
I've decided we're
going on a camping trip.

12:51.422 --> 12:52.293
Really?

12:52.336 --> 12:53.163
Yes.

12:53.207 --> 12:54.338
So get packing.

13:04.871 --> 13:05.915
That's the last of it.

13:05.959 --> 13:06.960
Yup.

13:07.003 --> 13:08.962
Time to hit the road.

13:09.005 --> 13:11.312
All right, girls.

13:11.355 --> 13:12.443
Let's go.

13:12.487 --> 13:14.315
I call shotgun.

13:33.725 --> 13:35.553
No no no, it goes there.

13:35.597 --> 13:36.728
No it doesn't.

13:36.772 --> 13:38.426
Maggie, I've done this before.

13:38.469 --> 13:40.080
Yeah, and you do
it wrong every time.

13:40.123 --> 13:41.864
And you girls argue every time,

13:41.908 --> 13:42.865
and you're both wrong.

13:42.909 --> 13:44.258
It goes right here.

13:47.217 --> 13:48.131
Help me out.

13:50.742 --> 13:51.874
Hey.

13:51.918 --> 13:53.354
I brought dinner for everyone.

13:54.398 --> 13:55.182
Hey, babe.

13:55.225 --> 13:57.053
Hey, babe.

13:57.097 --> 13:59.273
Thank you, but we're
making hobo dinners.

13:59.316 --> 14:01.057
Oh, the hobo dinners.

14:01.101 --> 14:02.232
What's that?

14:02.276 --> 14:03.451
Dinner cooked in tinfoil.

14:03.494 --> 14:05.148
We always do that when we camp.

14:05.192 --> 14:07.194
Oh, well, all right then.

14:07.237 --> 14:08.456
Hobo dinners it is.

14:11.894 --> 14:13.591
Okay, what can I do to help?

14:13.635 --> 14:15.419
Well, you can hobo your
heinie over to the car

14:15.463 --> 14:16.464
and help me unload.

14:16.507 --> 14:17.639
All right.

14:17.682 --> 14:18.466
Nice tags.

14:25.255 --> 14:26.822
Ugh.

14:26.866 --> 14:29.259
Can you believe this?

14:29.303 --> 14:30.608
Get used to it.

14:45.232 --> 14:46.929
Um, I gotta go to the outhouse.

14:46.973 --> 14:48.235
Anybody wanna go with me?

14:48.278 --> 14:49.149
No.

14:50.193 --> 14:50.977
I'll go.

14:52.195 --> 14:53.327
I'll be fine.

14:57.548 --> 14:59.028
Hey, you want one?

15:02.640 --> 15:03.380
Sure.

15:06.340 --> 15:09.082
You're a naughty
girl, aren't you?

15:09.125 --> 15:10.822
So,

15:10.866 --> 15:13.042
you know, in a
week, school starts

15:13.086 --> 15:14.652
in the city.

15:14.696 --> 15:17.829
Actually, school
starts in two weeks.

15:17.873 --> 15:19.266
Hey, hey, what are you doing?

15:19.309 --> 15:19.919
Don't do that,
you're gonna burn it.

15:19.962 --> 15:21.050
You ruined it.

15:21.094 --> 15:22.791
I like 'em burnt.

15:22.834 --> 15:24.706
Besides, you aren't our boss.

15:24.749 --> 15:27.448
Oh, well I'll be
marrying your mother,

15:27.491 --> 15:29.102
so soon you'll be
living in my house

15:29.145 --> 15:31.887
and under my roof, my rules.

15:31.931 --> 15:33.410
Your house?

15:33.454 --> 15:35.804
Yeah, that's right.

15:35.847 --> 15:37.632
What about our house?

15:37.675 --> 15:40.069
Bank is gonna
foreclose on your house.

15:40.113 --> 15:41.462
Don't give your
mother a hard time,

15:41.505 --> 15:44.334
she's been through
enough already.

15:44.378 --> 15:45.466
Either she sells it or the bank

15:45.509 --> 15:47.163
takes it away.

15:47.207 --> 15:48.295
We've already called
the real estate agent.

15:48.338 --> 15:49.861
That's it.

15:49.905 --> 15:51.863
Now, listen to me,
there are rewards

15:51.907 --> 15:54.301
for those who are helpful,

15:54.344 --> 15:56.303
and for those who aren't,

16:00.089 --> 16:01.917
don't you push me.

16:08.141 --> 16:09.925
Hey.

16:09.969 --> 16:11.100
Ah, marshmallows.

16:11.144 --> 16:12.536
I'll get the chocolate.

16:12.580 --> 16:13.929
Oh no, let me get the chocolate.

16:20.327 --> 16:21.067
What?

17:05.459 --> 17:06.676
Just a minute.

17:11.377 --> 17:13.075
I said just a minute.

17:25.782 --> 17:27.089
No, no, let me go.

17:27.133 --> 17:27.959
Let me go.

17:28.002 --> 17:29.570
No.

17:29.613 --> 17:31.093
Hey, hey, hey, Maggie,
Maggie, are you okay?

17:31.137 --> 17:32.007
Someone was watching
me in the bathroom.

17:32.051 --> 17:33.400
What?

17:33.443 --> 17:34.314
No way.
I saw it.

17:34.357 --> 17:35.489
Okay, I'll go check.

17:35.532 --> 17:36.098
I'm gonna go check right now.

17:36.142 --> 17:37.099
I saw it.

17:37.143 --> 17:37.926
I saw it.

17:39.710 --> 17:41.364
Come on, come with
me, come on, come on.

17:41.408 --> 17:42.496
Come on, girls.

18:17.661 --> 18:18.575
All right, girls.

18:18.619 --> 18:20.186
Help me unload and...

18:21.274 --> 18:22.057
Okay.

18:23.928 --> 18:25.626
Oh, man, if we're doing
more of this camping

18:25.669 --> 18:28.411
I'll have to buy us an RV.

18:28.455 --> 18:30.196
I can't sleep on the ground,
it's killing my back,

18:30.239 --> 18:31.022
sweetie.

18:32.546 --> 18:34.243
Richard, I should've told them.

18:34.287 --> 18:34.896
I just didn't want them
to give you a hard time

18:34.939 --> 18:36.027
about it.

18:36.071 --> 18:37.159
Well, it didn't work.

18:37.203 --> 18:38.552
Did they say something?

18:38.595 --> 18:40.293
No, it's just when they don't

18:40.336 --> 18:42.164
is when I worry.

18:42.208 --> 18:43.992
Come on, it'll
be okay, they can't

18:44.035 --> 18:45.776
stay mad forever.

18:45.820 --> 18:47.865
And I got your back,
whatever you need.

18:47.909 --> 18:48.649
Okay?

18:51.434 --> 18:52.914
Okay.

18:52.957 --> 18:54.089
You unload the
car, I'm gonna soak

18:54.133 --> 18:55.003
in the bath.

19:06.449 --> 19:07.189
Oh, Maggie.

19:11.585 --> 19:14.196
Your dad was sure handsome, huh?

19:14.240 --> 19:16.677
He really loved holding you.

19:16.720 --> 19:17.765
You know, he was the
only one that could

19:17.808 --> 19:19.897
get you to fall asleep.

19:19.941 --> 19:22.726
He would sing you
old Beatles songs.

19:24.772 --> 19:27.166
I wish I could remember more.

19:28.993 --> 19:31.953
You know, I know
that this is hard,

19:31.996 --> 19:35.391
but you're gonna have
to get through it.

19:35.435 --> 19:38.351
Maggie, when I was your
age I worked two jobs.

19:38.394 --> 19:40.440
You have it pretty
good, and Richard's

19:40.483 --> 19:42.224
got a nice, big home.

19:42.268 --> 19:44.835
Richard is a total jerk
and you don't see it.

19:44.879 --> 19:46.750
Don't be rude.

19:46.794 --> 19:50.058
All you care about is Richard.

19:50.101 --> 19:52.321
That kind of disrespect
is not acceptable.

19:52.365 --> 19:54.280
Moving is unacceptable.

19:54.323 --> 19:56.891
This engagement is unacceptable.

19:56.934 --> 19:59.285
And Richard is a total scumbag.

20:13.124 --> 20:17.433
She's been different
since he's been around.

20:17.477 --> 20:18.913
Have you seen Tony?

20:20.044 --> 20:21.263
No.

20:21.307 --> 20:22.090
I mean...

20:24.527 --> 20:25.920
What's going on?

20:28.139 --> 20:30.968
I told you if you
didn't put out...

20:38.454 --> 20:39.238
Maggie.

20:41.544 --> 20:42.937
Maggie, I'm sorry, okay?

20:42.980 --> 20:43.720
I just...

20:49.770 --> 20:52.120
Living room is all packed up.

20:54.122 --> 20:55.166
What's wrong?

20:56.603 --> 20:58.953
Maggie hasn't come home yet.

20:58.996 --> 21:01.042
Just an excuse to avoid work.

21:01.085 --> 21:02.609
No, I slapped her.

21:04.219 --> 21:05.525
And in the end, it'll
make her stronger,

21:05.568 --> 21:07.048
you'll see, now
give me some plates.

21:07.091 --> 21:07.962
Mom, it's Maggie.

21:08.005 --> 21:08.789
Something's wrong.

21:08.832 --> 21:09.572
Where is she?

21:09.616 --> 21:10.486
She's outside.

21:10.530 --> 21:11.270
Oh man.

21:14.185 --> 21:14.969
It's Maggie.

21:15.012 --> 21:15.883
She's been hurt.

21:15.926 --> 21:16.666
Maggie.

21:17.972 --> 21:19.452
Maggie.

21:19.495 --> 21:20.975
Hi, mom.

21:21.018 --> 21:22.063
Oh my god, you smell like booze.

21:22.106 --> 21:23.499
All right, let's get her up.

21:23.543 --> 21:24.979
Come on, come on,
sweetie, let's get

21:25.022 --> 21:25.806
you up now.

21:25.849 --> 21:26.676
Come on up.

21:28.461 --> 21:30.289
She beat up Tony
and his new girlfriend

21:30.332 --> 21:31.290
hit her on the
head with a bottle.

21:31.333 --> 21:33.161
She beat up Tony?

21:33.204 --> 21:34.162
Maggie, who's Tony.

21:34.205 --> 21:35.294
He's a jerk, mom.

21:35.337 --> 21:36.295
He had it coming.

21:36.338 --> 21:37.078
Oh god.

21:38.775 --> 21:40.299
Erica, thank you for
bringing her home.

21:40.342 --> 21:41.996
Don't worry about it.

21:42.039 --> 21:43.389
Honey, are you okay?

21:44.390 --> 21:45.652
You okay, sweetie?

21:48.307 --> 21:49.656
Goddammit.

21:49.699 --> 21:51.397
These shoes cost $200.

21:52.702 --> 21:53.877
I'm sorry, I'm sor...

21:55.096 --> 21:56.315
Maggie, come on.

21:57.228 --> 21:58.360
Come on.

21:58.404 --> 21:59.622
I am so sorry.

21:59.666 --> 22:00.667
Come on, babe.

22:00.710 --> 22:02.233
I'm sorry, baby.

22:02.277 --> 22:03.496
That's all right,
I'll just hose 'em off.

22:03.539 --> 22:04.671
Okay, I'm sorry.

22:04.714 --> 22:06.629
Come on, baby.

22:06.673 --> 22:08.196
Dammit.

22:16.944 --> 22:18.511
How long?

22:18.554 --> 22:20.382
How long have you guys
been skipping the pool?

22:20.426 --> 22:21.209
Lizzie.

22:22.253 --> 22:23.342
All summer.

22:23.385 --> 22:24.386
Shut up, Lizzie.

22:24.430 --> 22:25.822
No one her age is at the pool.

22:25.866 --> 22:27.389
Has she been drinking
all summer long?

22:27.433 --> 22:28.999
There's always people drinking.

22:29.043 --> 22:30.174
I can't believe you two.

22:30.218 --> 22:31.698
And who's Tony?

22:31.741 --> 22:33.482
He's no one.

22:38.095 --> 22:39.967
All right, stay with
her until she's done.

22:40.010 --> 22:42.317
I'm gonna go check on Richard.

22:47.540 --> 22:48.628
Lizzie said that
they've been going

22:48.671 --> 22:50.281
to the creek all summer long.

22:50.325 --> 22:53.546
Wow, so no
supervision all summer.

22:53.589 --> 22:54.373
Oh, sorry.

22:56.200 --> 22:57.288
This probably isn't
the first time that

22:57.332 --> 22:58.899
she's been drinking either.

22:58.942 --> 23:00.814
Well, first time she got caught.

23:00.857 --> 23:02.076
Probably

23:02.119 --> 23:03.817
sex and drugs too.

23:03.860 --> 23:05.601
You know, she brought this Tony

23:05.645 --> 23:07.298
to my house.

23:07.342 --> 23:09.823
Huh, she's gonna be a
real handful next year.

23:09.866 --> 23:11.302
I'm just glad the high
school she's going to

23:11.346 --> 23:12.086
is proper.

23:13.479 --> 23:14.741
Hope she fits in.

23:15.872 --> 23:16.612
Yeah.

23:18.614 --> 23:19.398
Me too.

23:56.783 --> 23:58.132
Holy hell.

23:58.175 --> 23:59.786
Lizzie, language.

23:59.829 --> 24:00.917
This place is huge.

24:00.961 --> 24:02.484
Hey hey hey.

24:02.528 --> 24:03.224
My family.

24:04.312 --> 24:05.487
My beautiful bride.

24:05.531 --> 24:06.314
Hey, baby.

24:06.357 --> 24:07.097
Hello.

24:09.186 --> 24:09.926
I was just having a little dip

24:09.970 --> 24:10.840
in the pool.

24:10.884 --> 24:11.798
There's a pool?

24:11.841 --> 24:13.147
There is.

24:13.190 --> 24:14.931
It's a cool place, Richard.

24:14.975 --> 24:16.063
Thank you.

24:16.106 --> 24:18.500
Oh, I do have some ground rules.

24:18.544 --> 24:20.937
I have some expensive
artwork and collectibles,

24:20.981 --> 24:22.983
so please don't touch them.

24:23.026 --> 24:25.376
Also, that's my office in there.

24:25.420 --> 24:27.640
That's off-limits,
that's my space.

24:27.683 --> 24:29.119
Can I go check out the pool?

24:29.163 --> 24:30.686
You can, go ahead.

24:32.471 --> 24:33.950
I have something
cool to show you.

24:33.994 --> 24:35.169
Wait right here.

24:39.347 --> 24:41.392
Now your mother said that

24:41.436 --> 24:42.785
you play softball.

24:44.439 --> 24:46.136
Huh, Babe Ruth.

24:46.180 --> 24:48.008
Yeah, Babe Ruth.

24:48.051 --> 24:49.052
It's been authenticated.

24:49.096 --> 24:51.315
That's his real signature.

24:51.359 --> 24:52.795
Worth a lot?

24:52.839 --> 24:54.318
Oh oh oh, some
treasures you can't

24:54.362 --> 24:55.494
put a price on.

24:57.974 --> 25:00.063
You wanna see your
room upstairs?

25:00.107 --> 25:01.804
Guess I should.

25:06.505 --> 25:07.897
You're doing so good.

25:07.941 --> 25:09.551
Well, I'm a little nervous.

25:09.595 --> 25:10.726
Don't be nervous.

25:10.770 --> 25:12.336
Am I sweating?

25:12.380 --> 25:12.772
You're sweating
a little bit, yeah.

25:12.815 --> 25:14.338
Okay.

25:14.382 --> 25:15.644
I think she's
gonna like her room.

25:15.688 --> 25:17.820
Would you like to see your room?

25:17.864 --> 25:19.169
Mm-hmm.

25:19.213 --> 25:20.301
Let's go on up.

25:29.963 --> 25:31.573
It's pink.

25:31.617 --> 25:32.705
Yeah it is.

25:32.748 --> 25:34.315
Well, yeah.

25:34.358 --> 25:36.099
This was the previous
owner's daughter's room.

25:36.143 --> 25:37.579
I just haven't had a chance
to repaint or anything.

25:37.623 --> 25:38.537
I'm sorry.

25:38.580 --> 25:40.016
Well,

25:40.060 --> 25:41.322
maybe you'll let
Maggie repaint it.

25:41.365 --> 25:43.280
You know, she's an artist.

25:43.324 --> 25:46.632
Oh yeah, sure,
whatever you want.

25:46.675 --> 25:47.589
Maybe.

25:47.633 --> 25:49.199
This is your room.

25:49.243 --> 25:51.114
You paint it whatever
color you want.

25:51.158 --> 25:52.289
Thank you.

25:52.333 --> 25:53.769
You're welcome.

26:00.123 --> 26:01.560
Maggie, I know
that change is hard,

26:01.603 --> 26:03.474
but sometimes it's for the best.

26:08.915 --> 26:10.133
Have a nice day.

26:12.266 --> 26:14.616
Here's your class schedule.

26:14.660 --> 26:15.574
Wood shop?

26:17.358 --> 26:18.620
No, I didn't ask for
any of these classes.

26:18.664 --> 26:20.622
They're all we had left.

26:24.539 --> 26:25.409
Hello.

26:25.453 --> 26:27.020
I'm Chip.

26:27.063 --> 26:28.499
I've been forced to
be a peer mediator

26:28.543 --> 26:29.718
because I was
deemed a recluse by

26:29.762 --> 26:30.893
Principal Donnermeyer.

26:30.937 --> 26:32.634
Hello, Chip.

26:32.678 --> 26:36.595
You keep that up, and
you will be suspended.

26:36.638 --> 26:39.859
Right, well, Chip,
thanks but no thanks.

26:40.903 --> 26:42.426
It's a big school.

26:42.470 --> 26:43.689
You'll get lost.

26:46.996 --> 26:49.433
Hey, watch it, you ass.

26:49.477 --> 26:50.260
What?

26:51.610 --> 26:53.176
I wouldn't cuss too loud.

26:53.220 --> 26:54.656
Donnermeyer hates that.

26:56.571 --> 26:57.659
You're late, come on.

26:57.703 --> 26:59.618
Next class is near mine.

27:02.490 --> 27:03.404
I'm Maggie.

27:05.014 --> 27:05.754
Chip.

27:06.712 --> 27:08.061
Like

27:08.104 --> 27:08.888
microchip.

27:13.457 --> 27:14.284
Maggie.

27:14.328 --> 27:15.068
Oh.

27:22.989 --> 27:24.207
Hi, Maggie.

27:24.251 --> 27:24.991
Hey,

27:26.122 --> 27:27.646
macrochip.

27:27.689 --> 27:28.603
Microchip.

27:28.647 --> 27:30.039
Right.

27:30.083 --> 27:32.215
How was the first day?

27:32.259 --> 27:33.477
It was boring.

27:35.741 --> 27:37.090
I don't suppose
you know anything

27:37.133 --> 27:39.527
cool to do around here.

27:39.570 --> 27:40.702
Sometimes.

27:40.746 --> 27:42.095
I work a lot.

27:42.138 --> 27:43.705
Yeah, where do you work?

27:43.749 --> 27:46.099
At my dad's pool company.

27:46.142 --> 27:46.882
Neat.

27:50.799 --> 27:51.974
So there's this thing on Fridays

27:52.018 --> 27:54.716
where a bunch of us, you know,

27:54.760 --> 27:56.500
like, listen to music and hack.

27:56.544 --> 27:58.415
Maybe you wanna
stop in sometime.

27:58.459 --> 27:59.590
It's cool if you don't.

28:01.070 --> 28:02.419
You hack?

28:02.463 --> 28:04.117
Like computers or like

28:05.074 --> 28:06.597
back accounts?

28:06.641 --> 28:08.861
No, it's like we
practice hacking,

28:08.904 --> 28:10.123
like, each other.

28:10.166 --> 28:10.950
Of course.

28:13.561 --> 28:15.432
That's my ride.

28:15.476 --> 28:16.346
I'll see ya.

28:18.261 --> 28:19.262
Cool.

28:19.306 --> 28:20.611
See you tomorrow.

29:12.968 --> 29:14.448
I'm going to bed.

29:19.627 --> 29:20.976
Hey, where are you going?

29:21.020 --> 29:21.760
Bed.

29:22.935 --> 29:24.240
Okay.

29:24.284 --> 29:25.589
Made a cocktail for ya.

29:25.633 --> 29:27.156
Nice.

29:27.200 --> 29:28.636
Fight on tonight,
Sanchez versus Diaz,

29:28.679 --> 29:30.290
and it's a big deal.

29:30.333 --> 29:31.987
I was hoping for
something romantic

29:32.031 --> 29:33.554
like The Notebook.

29:33.597 --> 29:34.860
Oh.

29:58.840 --> 30:00.668
Have a good one, Chip.

30:04.672 --> 30:06.195
Hey, Mags.

30:06.239 --> 30:07.196
I'm going shopping
with Lizzie to get

30:07.240 --> 30:08.894
school supplies, you wanna come?

30:08.937 --> 30:11.592
Ah, it's a Saturday and I don't

30:11.635 --> 30:13.246
really wanna do
school on Saturdays.

30:13.289 --> 30:14.813
Okay.

30:14.856 --> 30:17.250
Richard is golfing
so you be good.

30:17.293 --> 30:18.033
Okay.

32:14.933 --> 32:15.716
Yep.

32:49.793 --> 32:52.144
No no, five G's,
don't insult me.

32:52.187 --> 32:53.536
Are you crazy?

32:53.580 --> 32:54.668
It's not worth my time.

32:54.711 --> 32:57.062
It's gotta be 50 G's or nothing.

32:58.063 --> 32:59.716
Oh, that's crazy.

32:59.760 --> 33:00.543
Now look,

33:01.805 --> 33:03.155
five G's, that's an insult.

33:48.461 --> 33:51.159
The ball moved, so
that's a stroke.

33:51.203 --> 33:52.639
You owe me a grand.

33:52.682 --> 33:54.075
I'm not gonna
discuss it, so, I'll

33:54.119 --> 33:55.163
call ya later.

33:58.645 --> 34:00.516
All right, let's
see what our little

34:00.560 --> 34:01.952
girl's been up to.

34:04.564 --> 34:05.304
She...

34:24.496 --> 34:25.715
What the hell?

34:27.413 --> 34:29.458
We all have secrets, Maggie.

34:29.502 --> 34:30.545
You keep mine,

34:32.547 --> 34:34.681
and I'll keep yours.

34:34.724 --> 34:37.031
Now that I've seen you,

34:37.074 --> 34:38.380
you can stop coming
onto me in front

34:38.424 --> 34:40.078
of your mother.

34:40.121 --> 34:42.123
That's not polite.

34:42.167 --> 34:42.906
Oh,

34:44.516 --> 34:47.346
and don't you ever
steal from me again.

34:48.476 --> 34:49.870
You understand me?

35:17.202 --> 35:18.116
Hi, sweet pea.

35:18.159 --> 35:19.726
Hey.

35:19.769 --> 35:20.640
Did your afternoon go better?

35:20.683 --> 35:21.641
Oh, much.

35:21.684 --> 35:23.338
Thank you.

35:23.382 --> 35:24.948
Maggie give you any trouble?

35:24.992 --> 35:26.036
Nope, not even a little bit.

35:26.080 --> 35:26.820
That's nice.

35:28.300 --> 35:29.214
Who is it?

35:30.824 --> 35:32.260
Hey, babe.

35:32.304 --> 35:33.957
Popcorn?

35:34.001 --> 35:34.828
I'm okay.

35:40.442 --> 35:41.965
What's going on?

35:42.009 --> 35:42.923
Well, mom,

35:44.925 --> 35:47.319
I guess I gotta
tell you something.

35:47.362 --> 35:48.363
What?

35:48.407 --> 35:49.408
I don't really know.

35:49.451 --> 35:50.757
Hey.

35:50.800 --> 35:52.454
Hey.

35:52.498 --> 35:54.195
I'm gonna run down to
the convenience store

35:54.239 --> 35:56.154
'cause we're low on beer.

35:57.590 --> 35:59.940
I just bought you a six pack.

35:59.983 --> 36:02.203
Oh yeah, well,
Lawrence stopped by.

36:02.247 --> 36:03.204
We had a few.

36:04.466 --> 36:05.772
You just missed him, sweetie.

36:05.815 --> 36:06.816
Oh, I'm so sorry.

36:06.860 --> 36:08.296
Yeah.

36:08.340 --> 36:09.819
So Maggie, family movie
night, 15 minutes,

36:09.863 --> 36:13.171
everyone downstairs, sound good?

36:13.214 --> 36:14.041
Be back in 10.

36:14.084 --> 36:15.042
Okay, babe.

36:20.308 --> 36:22.180
Maggie, what's going on?

36:23.877 --> 36:27.315
Do you mind if I just
skip the movie night?

36:27.359 --> 36:28.360
No.

36:28.403 --> 36:29.665
No, baby.

36:29.709 --> 36:31.450
Just feel better, okay?

37:00.957 --> 37:02.437
Hey, come on.

37:02.481 --> 37:03.743
Hey, come on, give it back.

37:03.786 --> 37:05.092
Get off of him.

37:06.398 --> 37:07.181
Hey.

37:08.226 --> 37:09.488
Enough.

37:09.531 --> 37:11.968
You two, come with me.

37:12.012 --> 37:15.581
Mrs. Taylor, we have
procedures here.

37:15.624 --> 37:17.322
If someone did touch
Maggie, she should

37:17.365 --> 37:19.062
have come directly to me.

37:19.106 --> 37:21.021
We have a zero tolerance policy

37:21.064 --> 37:23.197
towards violent behavior.

37:23.241 --> 37:25.112
I'm afraid she will
have to be suspended

37:25.155 --> 37:26.069
for three days.

37:26.113 --> 37:27.549
Three days?

37:27.593 --> 37:29.943
Yes, and I would
suggest that she review

37:29.986 --> 37:32.206
the dress code guidelines.

37:32.250 --> 37:34.164
We like to give our
students the freedom

37:34.208 --> 37:36.602
to dress how they
want, but some outfits,

37:36.645 --> 37:38.517
they're just overly suggestive.

37:38.560 --> 37:41.215
And while Maggie's
suspended, she is not

37:41.259 --> 37:43.739
to be seen on the
campus for any reason.

37:43.783 --> 37:45.045
I just don't believe this.

37:45.088 --> 37:46.568
I do.

37:46.612 --> 37:49.571
This place is full of idiots.

37:49.615 --> 37:50.355
Maggie.

37:53.271 --> 37:54.010
I'm sorry.

37:59.625 --> 38:02.280
Chip, get in here.

38:03.585 --> 38:04.325
Maggie.

38:05.631 --> 38:06.849
Maggie.

38:06.893 --> 38:09.330
Hey, hey, wow, what's going on?

38:09.374 --> 38:10.462
Suspended.

38:10.505 --> 38:11.724
Three days.

38:11.767 --> 38:12.986
Whew, wow, she must have really

38:13.029 --> 38:14.770
hit that guy hard.

38:14.814 --> 38:16.381
You know, I've never
seen her this angry.

38:16.424 --> 38:18.252
I don't know.

38:18.296 --> 38:20.646
Maybe she needs counseling
for all the drinking

38:20.689 --> 38:23.257
and I wasn't paying
any attention.

38:23.301 --> 38:24.737
I didn't know what
she was wearing.

38:24.780 --> 38:27.000
She's always just
been my little Mags.

38:27.043 --> 38:28.784
You know, counseling never works

38:28.828 --> 38:31.352
unless the person who
needs it wants it.

38:31.396 --> 38:33.180
Now that's just my two cents.

38:33.223 --> 38:34.834
Yeah, you're right.

38:36.183 --> 38:37.532
Look, a lot of
people are giving up

38:37.576 --> 38:39.055
their prep time to
cover my classes.

38:39.099 --> 38:40.361
Go, get out.

38:40.405 --> 38:41.493
I'm home, she's fine.

38:41.536 --> 38:42.581
Thank you.

38:42.624 --> 38:43.364
Yep.

38:57.378 --> 38:59.075
Now I don't care what
Vice says they found,

38:59.119 --> 39:00.773
I don't handle the sales ticket.

39:00.816 --> 39:02.383
You pin it on Gary.

39:02.427 --> 39:03.689
That's who's being
paid to take the fall,

39:03.732 --> 39:04.951
you hear me?

39:04.994 --> 39:06.735
Now get the pawn
shop open again.

39:06.779 --> 39:10.522
I got a lot of money to
run through there, dammit.

39:23.012 --> 39:26.407
Well well well, will
you look at this day.

39:26.451 --> 39:28.540
Just a little vodka.

39:28.583 --> 39:30.237
I figure we would
finish off the bottle

39:30.280 --> 39:32.892
you were sneaking
from last night.

39:32.935 --> 39:33.719
I wasn't.

39:36.417 --> 39:38.854
Come on, now, don't lie to me.

39:38.898 --> 39:40.639
Liars are unattractive.

39:41.727 --> 39:43.424
Don't make me call Peg.

39:44.860 --> 39:47.167
Let's get rid of the evidence.

39:54.261 --> 39:57.177
It's always better to
have a drinking buddy.

39:57.220 --> 39:58.134
Buddy.

40:03.313 --> 40:04.053
Yeah.

40:05.272 --> 40:07.448
Hits the spot, doesn't it?

40:10.538 --> 40:11.539
Did you know my
father's favorite drink's

40:11.583 --> 40:12.932
a Mai Tai?

40:12.975 --> 40:14.150
Huh, no clue.

40:18.372 --> 40:19.112
Woo.

40:25.118 --> 40:27.512
We are having scotch.

40:27.555 --> 40:28.338
Oh.

40:32.212 --> 40:32.952
You

40:34.083 --> 40:34.823
are bad.

40:35.781 --> 40:36.521
And you

40:37.783 --> 40:39.306
have no idea.

40:42.135 --> 40:43.963
Oh my god.

40:44.006 --> 40:47.227
Can you imagine if mom
walked in right now.

40:47.270 --> 40:49.490
You let me worry
about your mother.

40:49.534 --> 40:51.057
You just enjoy that drink.

40:51.100 --> 40:51.840
Oh.

40:53.189 --> 40:53.929
Thank you.

41:04.418 --> 41:05.158
Mm.

41:32.577 --> 41:33.316
Stop that.

41:36.798 --> 41:39.409
Stop it, I'll tell my mom.

41:39.453 --> 41:42.064
She won't believe you.

41:42.108 --> 41:42.848
Uh huh.

41:44.589 --> 41:46.329
She won't believe you,
because you're a drunk

41:46.373 --> 41:49.332
and a liar, and you've
been asking for this.

41:49.376 --> 41:50.856
No.

41:50.899 --> 41:52.292
Yes, and that's
why you didn't say

41:52.335 --> 41:54.163
anything yesterday.

41:54.207 --> 41:56.514
And now there's no going back.

41:59.168 --> 42:01.388
You'll do what I
say, when I say it

42:01.431 --> 42:04.217
and you won't ever
say a word, ever.

43:13.852 --> 43:16.115
Man, do you have mom Peg?

43:18.073 --> 43:20.032
Hey.

43:20.075 --> 43:21.337
She kept telling me how
she can't trust you anymore

43:21.381 --> 43:22.687
and that she doesn't
know if a boy

43:22.730 --> 43:24.166
really grabbed
your butt or if you

43:24.210 --> 43:26.299
just let him, 'cause
you're kind of a tease.

43:26.342 --> 43:27.169
Did he?

43:27.213 --> 43:29.171
Yeah, he did.

43:29.215 --> 43:31.043
Are you okay?

43:31.086 --> 43:32.653
Yeah.

43:32.697 --> 43:34.350
I'm fine.

43:34.394 --> 43:36.222
Well, Richard talked
mom into letting me

43:36.265 --> 43:38.528
babysit the people down
the street tonight,

43:38.572 --> 43:40.661
even though it's
on a school night.

43:40.705 --> 43:42.489
And I met a cute boy at school.

43:42.532 --> 43:43.969
His name's Adam Roth.

43:44.012 --> 43:45.535
He's into modeling, you know?

43:45.579 --> 43:48.103
Wow, good for you.

43:48.147 --> 43:49.627
You know, I never
thought I'd be glad

43:49.670 --> 43:50.540
to say that they got
married, but Richard

43:50.584 --> 43:51.629
is actually a cool guy.

43:51.672 --> 43:53.065
Stay away from him.

43:53.108 --> 43:54.980
Maggie, why would you say that?

43:55.023 --> 43:56.416
Just be careful.

43:57.460 --> 43:58.548
Okay?

43:58.592 --> 43:59.375
Okay.

44:00.594 --> 44:02.074
I'm gonna go do my homework.

44:02.117 --> 44:03.728
Okay.

44:23.704 --> 44:26.533
Hey, hey hey,
where are you going?

44:26.576 --> 44:27.577
It's getting late.

44:27.621 --> 44:28.970
Lizzie isn't back yet.

44:29.014 --> 44:30.668
I'm getting worried so I thought

44:30.711 --> 44:32.539
I would go down there
and grade some papers

44:32.582 --> 44:34.106
until she came home.

44:34.149 --> 44:36.543
Come on, you've
worked enough today.

44:36.586 --> 44:38.240
She's fine.

44:38.284 --> 44:40.199
Besides, she's got a key.

44:41.287 --> 44:42.027
Right?

44:45.770 --> 44:48.163
Maggie, what are you doing?

44:48.207 --> 44:49.730
Why are you so late?

44:49.774 --> 44:51.819
They locked their
keys in their car.

44:51.863 --> 44:52.733
What are you doing up?

44:52.777 --> 44:53.778
It's a school night.

44:53.821 --> 44:55.475
Not for me.

44:55.518 --> 44:56.650
Remember?

44:56.694 --> 44:57.607
Oh, right.

44:59.653 --> 45:01.394
200 for Mexico.

45:01.437 --> 45:02.177
Mexico?

45:03.744 --> 45:04.614
Yeah, it's a summer school trip

45:04.658 --> 45:06.312
with Spanish Club.

45:06.355 --> 45:07.705
We moved here too
late to sign up,

45:07.748 --> 45:08.880
but someone canceled.

45:08.923 --> 45:09.663
Wow.

45:10.708 --> 45:12.274
Mom's letting you go?

45:12.318 --> 45:13.711
Well, I figured
I'd save the majority

45:13.754 --> 45:15.538
of the money up
before I asked her,

45:15.582 --> 45:18.063
that way I have a better chance.

45:19.194 --> 45:20.979
Did you know that mom ran away

45:21.022 --> 45:22.589
when she was 16?

45:22.632 --> 45:24.025
No, seriously?

45:24.069 --> 45:24.852
Yeah.

45:24.896 --> 45:25.766
Why?

45:25.810 --> 45:27.681
I don't know.

45:27.725 --> 45:29.378
But she said that she
had the time of her life

45:29.422 --> 45:30.771
and that's where she met dad.

45:30.815 --> 45:32.468
Really?

45:32.512 --> 45:34.035
I thought she met him
at a movie theater.

45:34.079 --> 45:35.907
No, she made it up.

45:35.950 --> 45:37.343
He worked in a restaurant.

45:41.695 --> 45:43.828
Tell me again what he was like.

45:48.441 --> 45:50.573
He'd come home
from construction,

45:50.617 --> 45:52.532
and he'd be wearing
this dirty blue shirt

45:52.575 --> 45:55.230
and it had Jason
written in cursive.

45:55.274 --> 45:57.319
I remember I'd untie his laces

45:57.363 --> 45:59.452
and I'd take off his boots.

46:01.628 --> 46:03.761
And mom would get so
mad because there'd be

46:03.804 --> 46:04.805
sand everywhere.

46:06.764 --> 46:09.854
But I didn't care,
because it meant

46:09.897 --> 46:11.116
that he was home

46:12.421 --> 46:14.772
and I was on top of the world.

46:18.471 --> 46:20.081
Sometimes I feel
like he's watching me

46:20.125 --> 46:20.995
from heaven.

46:25.913 --> 46:26.696
Me too.

46:33.791 --> 46:35.009
Hi.

46:35.053 --> 46:36.532
Hi.

46:36.576 --> 46:37.838
I never got to
thank you earlier.

46:37.882 --> 46:38.796
So thank you.

46:40.014 --> 46:40.972
No problem.

46:42.364 --> 46:43.278
Are you okay?

46:43.322 --> 46:45.672
I mean, your suspension?

46:45.715 --> 46:46.978
I'm sure it wasn't all that bad.

46:47.021 --> 46:49.110
Oh it really sucked.

46:49.154 --> 46:51.460
Hey, what's wrong?

46:51.504 --> 46:53.723
You look miserable.

46:53.767 --> 46:54.855
It's nothing.

46:59.817 --> 47:00.556
Ow.

47:05.257 --> 47:06.824
What are you doing?

47:06.867 --> 47:07.868
I'm not looking
for someone to come

47:07.912 --> 47:09.696
and save me, Chip.

47:09.739 --> 47:13.047
Maggie, my cousin
killed herself cutting.

47:15.006 --> 47:16.659
You know, it's always
something else,

47:16.703 --> 47:18.183
that's what they taught
us in peer mediation.

47:18.226 --> 47:19.837
It's something else.

47:19.880 --> 47:20.881
So what is it?

47:22.100 --> 47:22.840
I can't.

47:24.667 --> 47:27.105
He will hurt me, or he
will hurt my sister.

47:27.148 --> 47:27.888
Where's your dad?

47:27.932 --> 47:29.020
He's dead.

47:29.063 --> 47:30.848
I'm sorry.

47:30.891 --> 47:32.632
So you get yourself
out of the situation.

47:32.675 --> 47:34.590
Child Protective
Services can help you.

47:34.634 --> 47:36.984
That's just gonna get
my mother into trouble.

47:37.028 --> 47:40.292
Besides, I have no proof, okay?

47:40.335 --> 47:41.467
No one's gonna believe me.

47:41.510 --> 47:42.598
And why not?

47:44.296 --> 47:45.819
Because he's rich.

47:47.516 --> 47:49.692
I'm 18 in a few months.

47:49.736 --> 47:52.304
I'll be fine until then.

47:52.347 --> 47:55.046
In mediation, they tell us that

47:55.089 --> 47:58.919
the abuse won't stop
until you get yourself out

47:58.963 --> 48:00.573
or until you're dead.

48:01.966 --> 48:03.445
You have to get yourself
out, and if you need

48:03.489 --> 48:04.142
any help

48:06.231 --> 48:08.973
I will do everything
I can to help you.

48:09.016 --> 48:10.931
Thanks, Chip.

48:57.543 --> 49:00.111
Maggie, I just made $100.

49:00.154 --> 49:01.808
Babysitting?

49:01.851 --> 49:04.028
Yeah, I'm close to 200.

49:04.071 --> 49:07.509
Oh yeah, mom wants us
to help put dinner on.

49:14.386 --> 49:16.388
I'm going to run away.

49:16.431 --> 49:18.303
Maggie, that'll only
bring more problems.

49:18.346 --> 49:19.913
He hurt me.

49:19.957 --> 49:20.696
Again.

49:21.784 --> 49:22.524
Last night.

49:23.656 --> 49:24.526
I'm leaving.

49:26.311 --> 49:28.791
There's this little
town my dad grew up in

49:28.835 --> 49:30.576
and you know my mom
actually met him there

49:30.619 --> 49:31.533
when she ran away.

49:31.577 --> 49:32.360
So,

49:33.666 --> 49:35.798
I thought I'd check it out.

49:35.842 --> 49:37.278
You're not even
done with high school.

49:37.322 --> 49:39.367
And when they find
out you're only 17...

49:39.411 --> 49:42.022
So I will get a fake ID, Chip.

49:42.066 --> 49:44.285
But you were right, you know?

49:45.591 --> 49:46.548
I can't stay.

49:47.854 --> 49:48.594
All right.

49:50.726 --> 49:52.554
But I do need your help.

49:53.599 --> 49:54.643
Running away?

49:54.687 --> 49:55.427
No.

49:59.518 --> 50:00.258
Insurance.

50:03.870 --> 50:06.177
Kyle, Kyle, you are the man.

50:08.353 --> 50:11.573
Yeah, screw those Vice bastards.

50:11.617 --> 50:14.228
They can choke on one
of my baseball bats.

50:14.272 --> 50:16.056
Make sure John Carl gives
you some cash next week,

50:16.100 --> 50:17.318
all right?

50:17.362 --> 50:18.841
Yeah.

50:18.885 --> 50:20.843
Business as usual,
nothing changes,

50:20.887 --> 50:24.064
but more importantly,
Kyle, I don't change.

50:27.850 --> 50:28.590
Whew.

50:31.724 --> 50:34.553
It's a beautiful day
for a baseball game.

50:36.642 --> 50:39.427
Yeah, only if I didn't have
all these papers to grade.

50:39.471 --> 50:40.820
You're not ready?

50:40.863 --> 50:41.908
We gotta leave in 15 minutes.

50:41.951 --> 50:44.215
The game starts in an hour.

50:44.258 --> 50:46.173
I'm assuming that's
not your first.

50:46.217 --> 50:47.740
No, it's not, it's
a holiday weekend.

50:47.783 --> 50:49.350
It's a big game.

50:49.394 --> 50:50.134
You know, I just wanted it to be

50:50.177 --> 50:51.700
a family weekend.

50:51.744 --> 50:53.398
Well, Lizzie's babysitting.

50:53.441 --> 50:54.747
Good for
her, she's a hard worker.

50:54.790 --> 50:56.575
Good for Lizzie.

50:56.618 --> 50:57.489
And Maggie's been invited
by a friend's family

50:57.532 --> 50:58.881
to go camping.

50:58.925 --> 51:00.970
And she leaves tonight.

51:01.014 --> 51:02.015
You're gonna let
her spend the weekend

51:02.059 --> 51:03.582
with her boyfriend?

51:03.625 --> 51:04.713
I mean, what are you thinking?

51:04.757 --> 51:06.628
He's not my boyfriend.

51:08.326 --> 51:10.850
Look, Maggie's been
working really, really hard

51:10.893 --> 51:12.634
and her grades are up.

51:12.678 --> 51:14.245
You know, if I think it's okay,

51:14.288 --> 51:17.204
then I'll agree for her to go.

51:17.248 --> 51:18.858
Okay.

51:18.901 --> 51:21.513
Well, don't come to me
when she gets pregnant,

51:21.556 --> 51:23.384
for money or any help.

51:23.428 --> 51:24.864
I'm serious.

51:24.907 --> 51:25.647
Really?

51:28.607 --> 51:29.825
Oh, it's Chip.

51:36.745 --> 51:38.051
Come on in, Chip.

51:39.748 --> 51:41.272
Hey, Chip.

51:41.315 --> 51:42.664
What's going on with the pool?

51:42.708 --> 51:44.144
Seems to be a lot
of algae in it.

51:44.188 --> 51:46.190
You not use enough chlorine?

51:46.233 --> 51:48.105
Whole lot of algae
in the pool, right?

51:48.148 --> 51:49.018
Stop that.

51:51.630 --> 51:53.327
Hi, I'm Ms. Taylor.

51:53.371 --> 51:54.546
Hi, Mrs. Taylor.

51:54.589 --> 51:56.330
So when do you guys leave?

51:56.374 --> 51:57.853
In a couple hours.

51:57.897 --> 52:00.160
Oh, okay, and
where are you going?

52:00.204 --> 52:01.292
Cedar Falls.

52:01.335 --> 52:02.162
Oh we love that place.

52:02.206 --> 52:03.685
Yeah.

52:03.729 --> 52:05.078
Okay, Maggie, I
want you to answer

52:05.122 --> 52:06.253
your cell phone no
matter what time I call.

52:06.297 --> 52:07.950
Understand?

52:07.994 --> 52:09.038
And just have fun.

52:09.082 --> 52:09.822
So

52:10.649 --> 52:11.563
I can go?

52:11.606 --> 52:12.912
I say yes.

52:12.955 --> 52:13.695
Thank you.

52:13.739 --> 52:14.522
Mm-hmm.

52:17.046 --> 52:19.179
I'm gonna go get my stuff.

52:20.311 --> 52:21.703
Hey, Chip.

52:21.747 --> 52:23.662
So you're gonna keep your hands

52:23.705 --> 52:25.446
to yourself, aren't you?

52:25.490 --> 52:26.621
Right?

52:26.665 --> 52:27.622
Yes, sir.

52:27.666 --> 52:29.015
Good boy.

52:29.058 --> 52:30.669
Hey, we gotta go.

52:30.712 --> 52:32.149
We're running late.

52:34.455 --> 52:36.457
Have a good night, guys.

52:46.946 --> 52:47.947
Let's do this.

52:53.213 --> 52:54.649
Whoa, is that...

52:54.693 --> 52:56.347
Yeah, that's his
prized possession.

52:56.390 --> 52:58.218
Babe Ruth signed it.

52:58.262 --> 53:00.786
Come on, I think it's over here.

53:02.788 --> 53:03.615
Give me the camera.

53:03.658 --> 53:04.398
Okay.

53:09.751 --> 53:10.665
It's empty.

53:11.753 --> 53:12.493
No no.

53:13.494 --> 53:14.408
No, it can't be.

53:14.452 --> 53:15.757
He used this one.

53:16.802 --> 53:18.673
What about that?

53:18.717 --> 53:20.414
That has a password.

53:27.639 --> 53:29.249
Give me a minute.

53:29.293 --> 53:32.644
Okay, I've just
gotta grab some stuff.

53:49.051 --> 53:50.183
I'm sorry, sis.

53:54.796 --> 53:55.841
How much longer is it gonna be?

53:55.884 --> 53:56.842
They're almost home.

53:56.885 --> 53:58.278
I almost have it.

53:59.627 --> 54:02.717
The first five letters
are o, i, y, m, p.

54:04.980 --> 54:06.068
Olympus Pond.

54:10.769 --> 54:11.857
Wow, we're in.

54:13.250 --> 54:14.207
All right, let's
get the pictures

54:14.251 --> 54:15.164
and let's go.

54:17.254 --> 54:18.342
Look at this.

54:20.518 --> 54:23.042
He's been spying on your family.

54:29.788 --> 54:31.790
And there's a log here.

54:31.833 --> 54:32.573
Okay.

54:49.024 --> 54:50.548
Okay.

54:50.591 --> 54:51.331
Okay.

54:52.941 --> 54:54.508
That's it, Chip.

54:54.552 --> 54:55.292
Let's go.

55:23.145 --> 55:25.104
Keep your cell phone off.

55:25.147 --> 55:27.411
They can use it to track you.

55:30.718 --> 55:31.458
I can't.

55:32.894 --> 55:33.634
Please.

55:38.291 --> 55:40.859
Thank you for all of your help.

55:42.513 --> 55:45.777
And make sure he gets the
message tomorrow night.

55:45.820 --> 55:47.387
Yeah, he'll get it.

56:43.922 --> 56:44.966
I'm Charles.

56:48.709 --> 56:49.580
Most call me Charlie.

56:49.623 --> 56:51.233
Friends call me Chuck.

56:54.019 --> 56:55.020
I'm Maggie.

56:58.110 --> 56:59.633
Come on, let's go.

57:24.528 --> 57:26.051
Cool notebook.

57:26.094 --> 57:26.965
I used to do that back in school

57:27.008 --> 57:28.270
with the eraser.

57:29.750 --> 57:30.925
Yeah, it's my mom's from when

57:30.969 --> 57:32.623
she was my age.

57:32.666 --> 57:34.581
That's nice.

57:34.625 --> 57:36.888
I never knew my mom.

57:36.931 --> 57:38.759
She took off when I was five.

57:38.803 --> 57:40.239
I'm sorry.

57:40.282 --> 57:42.284
Yeah, I'm not.

57:42.328 --> 57:44.939
Ever been to Anita Rosa?

57:44.983 --> 57:46.158
You?

57:46.201 --> 57:48.160
Yeah, I got a place downtown.

57:48.203 --> 57:49.161
It's nothing special.

57:49.204 --> 57:50.336
I'm a mechanic by day.

57:50.379 --> 57:52.991
And by night?

57:53.034 --> 57:54.079
Other stuff.

57:55.602 --> 57:56.385
Oh.

57:58.126 --> 57:58.997
That's cool.

58:31.812 --> 58:34.206
Oh, are you military?

58:34.249 --> 58:35.599
No, I just wanna
appear that way.

58:35.642 --> 58:36.817
Oh.

58:36.861 --> 58:38.166
It was good talking to you.

58:38.210 --> 58:38.950
You too.

59:08.153 --> 59:08.893
Hey.

59:10.677 --> 59:11.722
Hey, sorry.

59:13.506 --> 59:15.508
I've got allergies.

59:15.552 --> 59:17.205
Yeah, okay.

59:17.249 --> 59:19.991
Look, I was on the street once

59:20.034 --> 59:21.645
and it sucks.

59:21.688 --> 59:23.168
I got a room.

59:23.211 --> 59:25.997
Not with me, a spare room.

59:26.040 --> 59:27.041
It's not the Hilton
but it's better

59:27.085 --> 59:28.869
than a bench.

59:28.913 --> 59:29.653
Yeah.

59:30.871 --> 59:32.569
Maybe just for the night.

59:32.612 --> 59:33.439
Sure.

59:33.482 --> 59:34.222
Come on.

59:52.153 --> 59:53.938
It's my latest project.

59:55.940 --> 59:56.680
Come on.

01:00:01.380 --> 01:00:03.164
What the hell, who's this?

01:00:03.208 --> 01:00:05.210
She needs a place to
stay for a few days.

01:00:05.253 --> 01:00:06.472
You're letting her stay here?

01:00:06.515 --> 01:00:08.300
I let you stay here.

01:00:08.343 --> 01:00:09.823
How do I know she's not a cop?

01:00:09.867 --> 01:00:11.608
I said she's staying.

01:00:13.131 --> 01:00:13.871
All right.

01:00:30.844 --> 01:00:32.759
Whose room is this?

01:00:32.803 --> 01:00:34.282
Nobody's.

01:00:34.326 --> 01:00:36.937
Stay as long as you need to.

01:00:36.981 --> 01:00:38.765
You aren't a narc, are you?

01:00:38.809 --> 01:00:40.462
No.

01:00:40.506 --> 01:00:41.855
I got two rules.

01:00:44.249 --> 01:00:46.599
Rule one, don't screw me over.

01:00:48.296 --> 01:00:50.690
And don't go in the basement.

01:00:50.734 --> 01:00:52.300
Cool.

01:00:52.344 --> 01:00:54.999
I'm just gonna be here
until I can find a job.

01:00:55.042 --> 01:00:56.522
Got ID says you're 18?

01:00:56.565 --> 01:00:57.305
I am 18.

01:01:00.526 --> 01:01:01.266
No.

01:01:04.008 --> 01:01:05.836
Do you know where
I could find one?

01:01:05.879 --> 01:01:06.663
Yeah.

01:01:07.751 --> 01:01:09.013
I'll hook you up.

01:01:10.449 --> 01:01:11.189
Goodnight.

01:02:14.556 --> 01:02:15.209
Maggie.

01:02:16.820 --> 01:02:17.864
I'm Crystal.

01:02:23.609 --> 01:02:25.002
Dammit.

01:02:25.045 --> 01:02:25.785
Ugh.

01:02:27.482 --> 01:02:29.397
They shut my service off.

01:02:30.485 --> 01:02:31.791
You have a phone, do you?

01:02:31.835 --> 01:02:32.618
No.

01:02:34.794 --> 01:02:36.100
Oh.

01:02:36.143 --> 01:02:38.319
All right, look, I gotta go.

01:02:39.886 --> 01:02:40.713
So,

01:02:42.628 --> 01:02:43.368
watch him.

01:02:44.891 --> 01:02:46.588
Okay, I guess.

01:02:46.632 --> 01:02:47.851
What's his name?

01:02:49.243 --> 01:02:50.201
For how long?

01:02:53.334 --> 01:02:54.248
For how long?

01:02:56.773 --> 01:02:57.512
Okay.

01:02:58.731 --> 01:03:00.037
What's your name?

01:03:05.782 --> 01:03:06.957
Hi, hon.

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:08.436
Hey, mom.

01:03:08.480 --> 01:03:10.003
Did Mr. Peterson
walk you home?

01:03:10.047 --> 01:03:11.526
He just watched
from their house.

01:03:11.570 --> 01:03:13.311
And he could see you?

01:03:13.354 --> 01:03:14.616
Yeah, well he didn't go
in until I waved to him.

01:03:14.660 --> 01:03:16.488
Hey, I just made 50 bucks.

01:03:16.531 --> 01:03:17.924
Oh, good job, honey.

01:03:17.968 --> 01:03:18.751
I know.

01:03:32.330 --> 01:03:33.070
Hey.

01:03:34.898 --> 01:03:36.377
Hey.

01:03:36.421 --> 01:03:38.118
Do you want the spoon?

01:03:42.209 --> 01:03:43.732
You are spooky, kid.

01:03:47.388 --> 01:03:49.042
Come on.

01:03:49.086 --> 01:03:50.565
One more bite and then I'm gonna

01:03:50.609 --> 01:03:51.828
give you a bath.

01:03:58.878 --> 01:03:59.618
What?

01:04:01.663 --> 01:04:03.274
Mom, my money's gone.

01:04:05.624 --> 01:04:06.843
What?

01:04:06.886 --> 01:04:07.931
$320 is gone.

01:04:10.107 --> 01:04:11.978
Maggie asked me for
money and I gave her 20.

01:04:12.022 --> 01:04:13.414
I'm calling her.

01:04:17.157 --> 01:04:18.855
You know Maggie hates me.

01:04:18.898 --> 01:04:20.378
Oh stop it, she
doesn't hate you.

01:04:20.421 --> 01:04:22.075
She does.

01:04:22.119 --> 01:04:25.252
I've been wanting to
tell you something.

01:04:26.558 --> 01:04:27.298
What?

01:04:29.039 --> 01:04:31.998
I feel like she's
trying to set me up.

01:04:32.042 --> 01:04:34.174
She's been very
suggestive with me.

01:04:34.218 --> 01:04:35.654
Whenever you're not
looking, and it started

01:04:35.697 --> 01:04:37.482
when you guys first got here.

01:04:37.525 --> 01:04:39.614
Why wouldn't you tell
me something like that?

01:04:39.658 --> 01:04:41.616
Because I'm afraid
she might tell lies,

01:04:41.660 --> 01:04:43.314
the way she told lies
about the boys at school

01:04:43.357 --> 01:04:44.315
and accuse me.

01:04:44.358 --> 01:04:45.925
Accuse you of what?

01:04:45.969 --> 01:04:46.839
Now she hasn't done
it yet, but she's

01:04:46.883 --> 01:04:48.928
threatened to.

01:04:48.972 --> 01:04:51.104
So I'm afraid to
make her mad, I just

01:04:51.148 --> 01:04:53.193
hide in my office
until she leaves.

01:04:53.237 --> 01:04:54.760
I can't believe this.

01:04:54.803 --> 01:04:56.718
I thought things
were going so well.

01:04:56.762 --> 01:04:58.155
And I'm also missing a bottle

01:04:58.198 --> 01:04:59.330
of tequila.

01:04:59.373 --> 01:05:00.200
Oh great.

01:05:02.028 --> 01:05:05.379
Lizzie, we're going
to the campground.

01:05:05.423 --> 01:05:06.598
Sorry.

01:05:06.641 --> 01:05:07.991
I'll be back.
Yeah.

01:05:29.055 --> 01:05:30.187
Where's Crystal?

01:05:30.230 --> 01:05:31.188
She went out.

01:05:31.231 --> 01:05:32.667
She hasn't come back.

01:05:32.711 --> 01:05:33.581
You didn't let
anyone in, did you?

01:05:33.625 --> 01:05:35.018
No, no one came by.

01:05:36.410 --> 01:05:37.150
Let's go.

01:05:38.282 --> 01:05:39.761
Hey, I'm CJ.

01:05:39.805 --> 01:05:40.545
Hey.

01:05:41.633 --> 01:05:42.503
Let's go.

01:05:42.547 --> 01:05:44.331
All right, man, chill.

01:05:44.375 --> 01:05:46.072
It's nice to meet you.

01:05:50.381 --> 01:05:51.904
That's crazy.

01:05:51.948 --> 01:05:54.559
So Maggie's disappeared
with Lizzie's money.

01:05:56.169 --> 01:05:58.084
I totally planted the seed.

01:05:58.128 --> 01:06:01.392
Yup, I totally set
the whole thing up.

01:06:01.435 --> 01:06:03.176
Yeah, even Peg.

01:06:03.220 --> 01:06:05.787
So Peg thinks Maggie's
coming onto me.

01:06:08.529 --> 01:06:09.530
Oh shoot, I got a text.

01:06:09.574 --> 01:06:10.314
Hold on.

01:06:18.278 --> 01:06:19.062
What?

01:06:21.064 --> 01:06:23.066
Let me call you right back.

01:06:38.646 --> 01:06:39.386
Dammit!

01:06:45.175 --> 01:06:46.915
Kyle,

01:06:46.959 --> 01:06:49.353
I need you to get a
tap on Maggie's phone.

01:06:49.396 --> 01:06:51.485
I don't care what it
costs, get it done.

01:06:51.529 --> 01:06:52.573
We're in a lot of trouble.

01:06:52.617 --> 01:06:54.619
She got in my home computer.

01:06:59.189 --> 01:07:00.059
Any answer?

01:07:00.103 --> 01:07:01.278
No, nothing.

01:07:01.321 --> 01:07:04.063
It's straight to voicemail.

01:07:04.107 --> 01:07:05.543
Maggie?

01:07:05.586 --> 01:07:07.980
Hey, is your mom there?

01:07:08.024 --> 01:07:09.286
Okay, you're on speaker.

01:07:09.329 --> 01:07:10.939
Hey, Peg.

01:07:10.983 --> 01:07:13.594
Hey something crazy
has come up at work,

01:07:13.638 --> 01:07:14.682
so I'm not gonna
be able to make it.

01:07:14.726 --> 01:07:15.944
I don't know when I'll be back.

01:07:15.988 --> 01:07:17.120
That's okay, babe.

01:07:17.163 --> 01:07:18.077
Most likely we'll find her drunk

01:07:18.121 --> 01:07:19.687
at the campground.

01:07:19.731 --> 01:07:20.732
All right, well
make sure you call me

01:07:20.775 --> 01:07:22.647
if you do, 'cause I'm worried.

01:07:22.690 --> 01:07:24.953
All right, thank you.

01:08:05.516 --> 01:08:06.908
Just drove it in yesterday.

01:08:06.952 --> 01:08:08.301
It's the best stuff
on the market.

01:08:08.345 --> 01:08:11.696
Yeah, it better
be for the price.

01:08:11.739 --> 01:08:12.697
Okay, okay.

01:08:16.483 --> 01:08:17.919
See you around, okay?

01:08:17.962 --> 01:08:18.877
Yeah, sure.

01:08:27.407 --> 01:08:28.147
Do it.

01:08:29.844 --> 01:08:31.149
What are you thinking
going out like that?

01:08:31.194 --> 01:08:32.412
I have business.

01:08:32.456 --> 01:08:33.238
BS.

01:08:35.111 --> 01:08:35.981
I'll see you around, bud.

01:08:36.024 --> 01:08:36.808
Thanks, man.

01:08:36.850 --> 01:08:37.591
Thank you.

01:08:38.636 --> 01:08:40.158
Wow.

01:08:40.203 --> 01:08:41.595
Look at you.

01:08:41.639 --> 01:08:43.031
Mom of the year.

01:08:43.075 --> 01:08:44.685
I just washed him.

01:08:44.729 --> 01:08:46.731
I am so tired of sitting here

01:08:46.774 --> 01:08:49.560
while you hook up
with other chicks.

01:08:52.258 --> 01:08:53.041
Slut.

01:08:54.086 --> 01:08:54.826
Hey.

01:09:39.697 --> 01:09:40.785
What are you doing here?

01:09:40.828 --> 01:09:42.352
I'm applying for a job.

01:09:42.395 --> 01:09:44.091
Look, I buy a little
weed from Charlie

01:09:44.136 --> 01:09:46.225
every once in awhile, okay?

01:09:46.269 --> 01:09:48.792
But I gotta tell you,
that place is not safe.

01:09:48.836 --> 01:09:50.403
I know.

01:09:50.447 --> 01:09:51.752
I'm only gonna be
there for a little bit

01:09:51.796 --> 01:09:53.450
until I can get a job.

01:09:54.668 --> 01:09:55.408
CJ?

01:09:56.888 --> 01:09:58.759
We have customers.

01:09:58.803 --> 01:09:59.934
I know, Joe.

01:09:59.978 --> 01:10:01.153
This is Maggie.

01:10:01.197 --> 01:10:03.982
She's applying for a job here.

01:10:04.025 --> 01:10:05.592
Hi.

01:10:05.636 --> 01:10:07.159
You're 18?

01:10:07.203 --> 01:10:07.986
Yes, sir.

01:10:09.727 --> 01:10:11.511
I don't have my ID, but

01:10:11.555 --> 01:10:12.295
I am.

01:10:13.731 --> 01:10:14.819
You vouch for her?

01:10:14.862 --> 01:10:15.994
Of course, she's a good friend

01:10:16.037 --> 01:10:17.561
of mine from school.

01:10:18.953 --> 01:10:21.565
If you'll vouch then it's good.

01:10:22.957 --> 01:10:24.655
$8.50 an hour, we
all split the tips.

01:10:24.698 --> 01:10:25.656
When can you start?

01:10:25.699 --> 01:10:26.613
Right now.

01:10:28.224 --> 01:10:29.964
Tomorrow, you bring your ID.

01:10:30.008 --> 01:10:30.791
Yes, sir.

01:10:31.923 --> 01:10:33.011
Good for me.

01:10:50.637 --> 01:10:52.160
You little son of a bitch.

01:10:52.204 --> 01:10:53.336
Messing around in my office.

01:10:53.379 --> 01:10:54.728
Get over here.

01:10:54.772 --> 01:10:55.555
Come here.

01:10:55.599 --> 01:10:57.296
Come here.

01:10:57.340 --> 01:10:57.992
You're gonna tell me
where to find Maggie.

01:10:58.036 --> 01:10:58.819
Huh?

01:10:58.863 --> 01:10:59.646
Where?

01:10:59.690 --> 01:11:00.430
I, I, I?

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:08.742
Now you're gonna tell me
where to find Maggie right now

01:11:08.786 --> 01:11:10.091
or this pool's gonna
need a whole lot more

01:11:10.135 --> 01:11:12.137
than chlorine to clean it.

01:11:13.791 --> 01:11:15.096
You understand me?
Please.

01:11:15.140 --> 01:11:16.141
Huh?

01:11:16.184 --> 01:11:17.621
Do you understand me?

01:11:21.755 --> 01:11:24.323
Let's see what's in here.

01:11:24.367 --> 01:11:26.020
It's okay, babe.

01:11:26.064 --> 01:11:28.109
Mom's just looking
for something.

01:11:28.153 --> 01:11:28.936
Oh.

01:11:31.591 --> 01:11:33.724
Miss Maggie was holding out.

01:11:36.422 --> 01:11:37.771
It's okay.

01:11:37.815 --> 01:11:38.555
Stupid.

01:11:44.169 --> 01:11:45.866
Thank you so much.

01:11:45.910 --> 01:11:47.172
Ah.

01:11:47.215 --> 01:11:49.696
You did great job, Maggie.

01:11:49.740 --> 01:11:50.828
Aw.

01:11:50.871 --> 01:11:52.656
Now, here are your tips.

01:11:56.050 --> 01:11:56.921
Thank you.

01:12:01.229 --> 01:12:01.969
Um,

01:12:04.363 --> 01:12:06.496
I was wondering if

01:12:06.539 --> 01:12:08.149
maybe

01:12:08.193 --> 01:12:09.803
you can remember a
John and Peg Taylor

01:12:09.847 --> 01:12:11.065
that worked here?

01:12:11.109 --> 01:12:13.459
It was about 18 years ago.

01:12:13.503 --> 01:12:14.982
I bought this
place five years ago

01:12:15.026 --> 01:12:16.375
and the owner before me passed.

01:12:16.419 --> 01:12:17.985
So I don't know.

01:12:18.029 --> 01:12:18.943
Well,

01:12:18.986 --> 01:12:20.074
it was a long shot.

01:12:20.118 --> 01:12:21.772
No, sorry.

01:12:21.815 --> 01:12:22.555
CJ.

01:12:24.862 --> 01:12:25.732
Yeah, Joe?

01:12:25.776 --> 01:12:26.646
Walk Maggie home.

01:12:26.690 --> 01:12:28.387
Okay.

01:12:28.431 --> 01:12:28.822
Ó_ And then get back
here for dinner, okay?

01:12:28.866 --> 01:12:29.867
Sure.

01:12:29.910 --> 01:12:31.477
11 o'clock tomorrow.

01:12:31.521 --> 01:12:33.392
That's the start of the
lunch shift, all right?

01:12:33.436 --> 01:12:34.872
Be on time.

01:12:34.915 --> 01:12:36.526
Yes.

01:12:36.569 --> 01:12:38.963
Oh, and don't forget your ID.

01:12:40.181 --> 01:12:41.792
ID.

01:12:41.835 --> 01:12:42.923
All right, put that stuff away

01:12:42.967 --> 01:12:44.838
and we'll head home.

01:12:44.882 --> 01:12:46.362
Okay.
All right.

01:12:47.928 --> 01:12:49.669
Thanks for walking me back.

01:12:49.713 --> 01:12:51.671
Hey, no problem.

01:12:51.715 --> 01:12:53.151
Look, if you want
me to stop in later,

01:12:53.194 --> 01:12:54.457
'cause this place is kind of...

01:12:54.500 --> 01:12:55.675
Sure.

01:12:55.719 --> 01:12:56.763
Yeah.

01:12:56.807 --> 01:12:57.808
See you later then.

01:12:57.851 --> 01:12:58.635
I'd like that.

01:12:58.678 --> 01:12:59.766
All right.

01:12:59.810 --> 01:13:00.463
Okay.
Bye.

01:13:00.506 --> 01:13:00.985
Bye.

01:13:08.427 --> 01:13:09.167
Okay.

01:13:10.211 --> 01:13:11.604
Time to go bye bye.

01:13:24.487 --> 01:13:25.226
Chip?

01:13:26.663 --> 01:13:28.665
Oh no you don't.

01:13:28.708 --> 01:13:30.275
I know you're in on this.

01:13:30.318 --> 01:13:31.798
Camping, really, Chip?

01:13:31.842 --> 01:13:32.886
You lied to me.

01:13:32.930 --> 01:13:34.279
Where's Maggie?

01:13:34.322 --> 01:13:35.715
What happened to you?

01:13:35.759 --> 01:13:36.803
I can't say.

01:13:37.935 --> 01:13:39.153
He will kill me.

01:13:40.546 --> 01:13:41.634
Listen, if Maggie's in trouble,

01:13:41.678 --> 01:13:43.593
you need to tell
me where she is.

01:13:43.636 --> 01:13:45.203
Tel me where she is.

01:13:49.468 --> 01:13:51.122
Screw him.

01:13:51.165 --> 01:13:52.515
He's just a bully.

01:13:54.212 --> 01:13:57.302
I gotta show you
something about Maggie.

01:13:58.346 --> 01:13:59.435
At your house.

01:14:00.958 --> 01:14:01.741
Let's go.

01:14:04.178 --> 01:14:08.487
It look exactly like
you with shorter hair.

01:14:08.531 --> 01:14:10.707
Shauna McLaughlin.

01:14:10.750 --> 01:14:11.490
Okay.

01:14:12.535 --> 01:14:13.753
This could work.

01:14:15.102 --> 01:14:16.843
I mean, people's
driver's licenses don't

01:14:16.887 --> 01:14:18.192
usually look like them anyways.

01:14:18.236 --> 01:14:19.193
The height and eye color match,

01:14:19.237 --> 01:14:20.891
that's the most important part.

01:14:20.934 --> 01:14:24.024
And I got a social
security card.

01:14:24.068 --> 01:14:24.808
Okay.

01:14:27.332 --> 01:14:28.855
Where'd you get them?

01:14:31.771 --> 01:14:33.164
Where's the kid?

01:14:34.339 --> 01:14:35.383
He's asleep.

01:14:37.429 --> 01:14:38.648
I just wanna make sure
that if I use these,

01:14:38.691 --> 01:14:40.040
I'm not gonna get arrested.

01:14:40.084 --> 01:14:41.520
The address is in Pittsburgh,

01:14:41.564 --> 01:14:42.565
don't use it there.

01:14:42.608 --> 01:14:43.522
Okay.

01:14:43.566 --> 01:14:44.305
How much?

01:14:45.524 --> 01:14:46.220
For you?

01:14:48.309 --> 01:14:49.920
175.

01:14:49.963 --> 01:14:51.051
I mean, the social security card

01:14:51.095 --> 01:14:53.010
cost that much itself.

01:14:53.053 --> 01:14:55.055
Let her have it for 150.

01:15:01.671 --> 01:15:02.541
Where are the guns,
where are the guns,

01:15:02.585 --> 01:15:03.368
where are the guns?

01:15:06.893 --> 01:15:08.547
Where are they?

01:15:08.591 --> 01:15:10.331
Screw off.

01:15:18.035 --> 01:15:18.775
Tell me.

01:15:20.428 --> 01:15:21.299
They're in the basement.

01:15:21.342 --> 01:15:22.692
Shut the hell up.

01:15:22.735 --> 01:15:23.910
You, show me.

01:15:27.131 --> 01:15:28.436
Go.

01:15:28.480 --> 01:15:29.829
You, on the couch.

01:15:29.873 --> 01:15:31.352
You, on the chair.

01:15:31.396 --> 01:15:32.528
Now!

01:15:32.571 --> 01:15:34.834
Get the hell back here!

01:15:34.878 --> 01:15:36.270
Sit your ass down.

01:15:46.237 --> 01:15:47.717
Oh no.

01:15:47.760 --> 01:15:49.109
You smashed Richard's computer?

01:15:49.153 --> 01:15:51.068
No.

01:15:51.111 --> 01:15:53.157
Chip, I need you to start
talking to me right now.

01:15:53.200 --> 01:15:54.854
You got it.

01:15:54.898 --> 01:15:55.638
What?

01:15:57.422 --> 01:15:58.902
We need to go to
the police right now.

01:15:58.945 --> 01:15:59.772
They're the only
ones that can get

01:15:59.816 --> 01:16:00.991
the data off this drive.

01:16:01.034 --> 01:16:02.427
What?

01:16:02.470 --> 01:16:03.471
Ms. Taylor,

01:16:05.256 --> 01:16:06.518
your husband was abusing Maggie.

01:16:06.562 --> 01:16:08.041
No.

01:16:08.085 --> 01:16:08.999
I have the proof right here.

01:16:09.042 --> 01:16:10.043
No.

01:16:10.087 --> 01:16:11.175
No that can't be true.

01:16:11.218 --> 01:16:13.003
That can't be true.

01:16:13.046 --> 01:16:16.310
I'm sorry, but she ran
away before he killed her.

01:16:18.051 --> 01:16:18.922
Where?

01:16:18.965 --> 01:16:21.054
Where did she go?

01:16:21.098 --> 01:16:22.055
Anita Rosa.

01:16:23.361 --> 01:16:24.580
Anita Rosa?

01:16:24.623 --> 01:16:25.581
Oh my god.

01:16:25.624 --> 01:16:26.407
What?

01:16:26.451 --> 01:16:27.191
What, mom?

01:16:28.540 --> 01:16:30.542
Wait, where are you going?

01:16:32.109 --> 01:16:33.240
I'm going to Anita Rosa.

01:16:33.284 --> 01:16:34.633
I know where she went.

01:16:34.677 --> 01:16:35.591
Chip, you take
Lizzie and that disc

01:16:35.634 --> 01:16:37.375
to the police right now.

01:16:37.418 --> 01:16:38.855
Okay.

01:16:38.898 --> 01:16:39.725
Mom, what if
Richard hurt Maggie?

01:16:39.769 --> 01:16:40.900
He could hurt you too.

01:16:40.944 --> 01:16:41.771
Oh, that's not gonna happen.

01:16:41.814 --> 01:16:42.902
I'm gonna go get Maggie.

01:16:42.946 --> 01:16:45.470
You do as you're told.

01:16:56.960 --> 01:16:58.309
What?

01:16:58.352 --> 01:17:00.311
You got a hit, where?

01:17:00.354 --> 01:17:01.225
Anita Rosa?

01:17:05.316 --> 01:17:06.186
You gotta get somebody
to go to my house

01:17:06.230 --> 01:17:07.710
and clean up my computer.

01:17:07.753 --> 01:17:09.929
Hey, hey hey, you
did a good job.

01:17:09.973 --> 01:17:11.191
Good job, buddy.

01:17:21.854 --> 01:17:24.640
Guys, I'm busier than a
one-arm paper hanger, please.

01:17:24.683 --> 01:17:26.337
Look, if you knew
anything about computers,

01:17:26.380 --> 01:17:29.427
you know that the data
is still in there.

01:17:29.470 --> 01:17:30.689
I don't know, it
looks pretty busted

01:17:30.733 --> 01:17:31.472
up to me.

01:17:33.170 --> 01:17:35.172
But, I'll send it
to CSI guys and see

01:17:35.215 --> 01:17:37.609
what they can do with it.

01:17:37.653 --> 01:17:40.003
But you're telling me
that this hard drive

01:17:40.046 --> 01:17:41.700
with all that illegal
content on there,

01:17:41.744 --> 01:17:43.963
belongs to Richard Banister?

01:17:44.007 --> 01:17:45.617
He was hurting my sister and now

01:17:45.661 --> 01:17:47.619
my mom's looking for her.

01:17:47.663 --> 01:17:48.707
But I'm just afraid
that he's gonna

01:17:48.751 --> 01:17:50.535
do something bad.

01:17:50.578 --> 01:17:54.713
And he's the Richard Banister
from Olympus Pawn Shop?

01:17:54.757 --> 01:17:56.976
We raided his shop
a couple weeks ago.

01:17:57.020 --> 01:17:59.326
Part of a sting operation
for illegal goods.

01:17:59.370 --> 01:18:00.458
But it looks like
he's gonna skirt

01:18:00.501 --> 01:18:02.678
the charges on a technicality.

01:18:04.680 --> 01:18:06.725
This is your dad?

01:18:06.769 --> 01:18:07.552
Step.

01:18:09.249 --> 01:18:11.556
And everything on
that hard drive is his?

01:18:11.599 --> 01:18:12.513
I told you.

01:18:14.951 --> 01:18:16.604
Where's your mom?

01:18:16.648 --> 01:18:18.215
On her way to Anita
Rosa to get my sister.

01:18:18.258 --> 01:18:20.391
What's her phone number?

01:18:20.434 --> 01:18:21.174
310...

01:18:27.093 --> 01:18:27.877
Sit down!

01:18:29.269 --> 01:18:31.271
They're not all there, man.

01:18:32.490 --> 01:18:33.796
Did you think I'm stupid?

01:18:33.839 --> 01:18:35.406
Get up.

01:18:35.449 --> 01:18:37.234
You're gonna show
me where they are

01:18:37.277 --> 01:18:38.322
or I'm gonna blow
your brains all over

01:18:38.365 --> 01:18:39.889
this friggin' floor.

01:18:41.194 --> 01:18:42.848
Tell 'em, Chuck.

01:18:42.892 --> 01:18:45.155
It's not worth dying over.

01:18:45.198 --> 01:18:49.115
Yeah, Chuck, they're
not worth dying over.

01:18:51.727 --> 01:18:53.032
The park.

01:18:53.076 --> 01:18:54.077
I buried 'em.

01:18:54.120 --> 01:18:55.165
Well, get a shovel.

01:18:55.208 --> 01:18:55.948
Now!

01:18:57.863 --> 01:18:58.646
Get up.

01:19:02.563 --> 01:19:03.390
Cover them.

01:19:25.456 --> 01:19:27.632
One wrong move, you're dead.

01:19:36.336 --> 01:19:37.990
Hello?

01:19:38.034 --> 01:19:38.817
Peg Banister, please.

01:19:38.861 --> 01:19:40.993
No, it's Taylor.

01:19:41.037 --> 01:19:42.647
Yeah, whatever.

01:19:42.690 --> 01:19:43.604
Who's this?

01:19:43.648 --> 01:19:45.432
Detective Wilson.

01:19:45.476 --> 01:19:46.999
I have your daughter
here and some very

01:19:47.043 --> 01:19:49.567
disturbing footage
on a hard drive

01:19:49.610 --> 01:19:51.699
that I think you're
gonna wanna see.

01:19:51.743 --> 01:19:53.484
That bastard.

01:19:53.527 --> 01:19:54.702
I'm on my way to get Maggie now.

01:19:54.746 --> 01:19:56.226
I'll come straight to you.

01:19:56.269 --> 01:19:57.793
No, I don't advise that, ma'am.

01:19:57.836 --> 01:19:59.533
I think it's best that we

01:19:59.577 --> 01:20:02.188
pick her up and
protect all of you.

01:20:02.232 --> 01:20:03.799
Richard has gone missing
and he's involved

01:20:03.842 --> 01:20:05.670
with some very bad people.

01:20:05.713 --> 01:20:07.628
What are you saying?

01:20:07.672 --> 01:20:09.805
We think he's working
with the cartel.

01:20:09.848 --> 01:20:10.893
Like the drug people?

01:20:10.936 --> 01:20:12.372
Yes.

01:20:12.416 --> 01:20:14.984
We think he's laundering
money for them.

01:20:15.027 --> 01:20:16.942
No, I'm sorry, I
have to go get Maggie.

01:20:16.986 --> 01:20:17.725
I'm sorry.

01:20:36.483 --> 01:20:38.137
Hey, hey, sit down.

01:20:38.181 --> 01:20:38.964
That's my kid.

01:20:39.008 --> 01:20:39.965
I don't care.

01:20:40.009 --> 01:20:40.879
Sit.

01:20:40.923 --> 01:20:41.662
I gotta get him.

01:20:41.706 --> 01:20:42.446
Sit.

01:20:44.013 --> 01:20:44.840
Sit down.

01:20:44.883 --> 01:20:45.884
Sit down.

01:20:48.931 --> 01:20:50.062
Get up, bitch.

01:20:50.106 --> 01:20:51.063
Get up.

01:21:16.132 --> 01:21:18.134
No, stop, don't fight it.

01:21:45.683 --> 01:21:47.293
Excuse me.

01:21:47.337 --> 01:21:49.469
Hi, I'm looking for a girl.

01:21:51.819 --> 01:21:53.169
Have you seen her?

01:21:55.084 --> 01:21:56.041
I...

01:21:56.085 --> 01:21:57.564
CJ, what's going on?

01:21:57.608 --> 01:22:00.611
I'm looking for my daughter.

01:22:00.654 --> 01:22:01.917
You know I didn't
buy this whole,

01:22:01.960 --> 01:22:03.353
she's a friend thing, right?

01:22:03.396 --> 01:22:05.137
Yes, sir, I know.

01:22:05.181 --> 01:22:07.096
Help her find Maggie,
and then you and I

01:22:07.139 --> 01:22:09.489
are having a long talk.

01:22:09.533 --> 01:22:10.969
Okay.

01:22:11.013 --> 01:22:12.275
Let's go, I know where she is.

01:22:12.318 --> 01:22:13.711
Okay, thank you.

01:22:23.155 --> 01:22:25.201
Let's go, come on.

01:22:25.244 --> 01:22:27.290
Okay, we're out of here.

01:22:27.333 --> 01:22:28.987
I didn't see anything.

01:22:29.031 --> 01:22:31.555
I don't know anything.

01:22:31.598 --> 01:22:33.687
We'll leave town right now.

01:22:36.081 --> 01:22:37.126
You say anything,

01:22:37.169 --> 01:22:38.997
I'll sell your kid.

01:22:39.041 --> 01:22:41.173
You'll never find him
again, do you understand me?

01:22:41.217 --> 01:22:42.000
Do you?

01:22:42.044 --> 01:22:42.870
Yes.

01:22:42.914 --> 01:22:43.654
Go.

01:22:44.829 --> 01:22:45.569
No.

01:22:46.483 --> 01:22:47.397
I'm sorry.

01:22:54.752 --> 01:22:57.407
You won't find anything.

01:23:04.109 --> 01:23:04.892
Oh yes.

01:23:07.199 --> 01:23:09.158
That's what I want.

01:23:09.201 --> 01:23:09.985
No.

01:23:11.160 --> 01:23:12.335
No.

01:23:12.378 --> 01:23:14.119
That's it.

01:23:14.163 --> 01:23:15.120
Oh baby, yep.

01:23:18.515 --> 01:23:20.560
That's all I need.

01:23:20.604 --> 01:23:22.823
Oh, what's that right there?

01:23:22.867 --> 01:23:24.825
Oh, it looks like a
daddy baby picture.

01:23:24.869 --> 01:23:25.870
Goodness, oh.

01:23:27.393 --> 01:23:28.525
Daddies are special,
aren't they?

01:23:28.568 --> 01:23:30.614
Oh ho ho ho, oh, you bitch.

01:23:32.137 --> 01:23:33.617
That was a mistake.

01:23:38.752 --> 01:23:40.232
Now

01:23:40.276 --> 01:23:41.103
okay.

01:23:41.146 --> 01:23:41.973
Please.

01:23:42.017 --> 01:23:42.930
Please!

01:23:42.974 --> 01:23:44.280
Please what?

01:23:44.323 --> 01:23:45.803
Please don't hurt me.

01:23:45.846 --> 01:23:47.413
Please.

01:23:47.457 --> 01:23:48.893
You know I know how
to do this, right?

01:23:48.936 --> 01:23:50.547
You know it's all about
the follow through?

01:23:50.590 --> 01:23:51.722
About the follow through,
you know that, right?

01:23:51.765 --> 01:23:52.549
Huh?

01:23:52.592 --> 01:23:53.593
You ready?

01:23:53.637 --> 01:23:54.855
Huh?

01:23:54.899 --> 01:23:56.379
One.

01:23:56.422 --> 01:23:57.336
Two.

01:23:57.380 --> 01:23:59.512
Please don't hurt me.

01:23:59.556 --> 01:24:00.296
Three.

01:24:03.299 --> 01:24:04.952
Oh shit.

01:24:04.996 --> 01:24:06.737
I told you not to
be messing with me.

01:24:06.780 --> 01:24:07.651
Hold on.

01:24:07.694 --> 01:24:08.956
Who is this?

01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:10.132
They better be there.

01:24:10.175 --> 01:24:11.829
Don't you move.

01:24:11.872 --> 01:24:15.137
Don't you make a noise,
you understand me?

01:24:15.180 --> 01:24:16.573
You stay right here.

01:24:16.616 --> 01:24:17.791
You wait for me.

01:24:24.929 --> 01:24:25.712
Hey you.

01:24:34.243 --> 01:24:35.026
Charlie.

01:24:36.114 --> 01:24:36.854
Charlie.

01:24:39.074 --> 01:24:39.813
Oh.

01:24:42.120 --> 01:24:44.427
This can't be any more perfect.

01:24:45.906 --> 01:24:49.040
Bunch of dead losers
fighting over guns.

01:24:50.563 --> 01:24:53.784
And you get killed
in a hail of bullets.

01:24:53.827 --> 01:24:55.742
No more problems for me.

01:24:55.786 --> 01:24:57.483
No more life for you.

01:24:57.527 --> 01:24:58.963
Huh?

01:24:59.006 --> 01:24:59.920
You know your mom,
she's probably

01:24:59.964 --> 01:25:01.574
gonna divorce me.

01:25:01.618 --> 01:25:02.575
But so what?

01:25:02.619 --> 01:25:03.750
No major loss.

01:25:03.794 --> 01:25:04.751
I was getting bored of her.

01:25:04.795 --> 01:25:05.970
Hey!

01:25:06.013 --> 01:25:07.145
Watch it.

01:25:07.189 --> 01:25:07.928
Watch it.

01:25:12.585 --> 01:25:16.111
Hey, Mags, you know what
makes me really bad?

01:25:17.764 --> 01:25:18.504
I always

01:25:19.810 --> 01:25:21.072
get away with it.

01:25:26.773 --> 01:25:27.905
Yeah.

01:25:27.948 --> 01:25:28.819
I like that.

01:26:21.219 --> 01:26:23.569
Whoa, now that's not
supposed to happen.

01:26:26.442 --> 01:26:28.270
Let's try one more time.

01:26:30.272 --> 01:26:31.011
Hey.

01:26:34.972 --> 01:26:36.016
I'm so sorry.

01:26:36.060 --> 01:26:37.975
Yes, yes, please hurry.

01:26:38.018 --> 01:26:39.977
Yeah, he's knocked out.

01:26:44.590 --> 01:26:46.853
Oh my god, I got you, baby.

01:26:48.333 --> 01:26:49.247
Are you okay?

01:26:54.339 --> 01:26:55.558
It's okay, baby.

01:26:57.603 --> 01:26:58.474
I'm sorry.

01:26:58.517 --> 01:26:59.475
I'm so sorry.

01:27:14.054 --> 01:27:14.794
Chip.

01:27:17.754 --> 01:27:19.234
Detective Wilson, I
just wanna thank you

01:27:19.277 --> 01:27:20.539
for everything that you've done.

01:27:20.583 --> 01:27:21.671
Only thanks I need is putting

01:27:21.714 --> 01:27:22.976
guys like Richard away.

01:27:24.587 --> 01:27:25.805
Excuse me.

01:27:25.849 --> 01:27:27.067
Gotta take this.

01:27:30.332 --> 01:27:32.508
You finally stood up
to the biggest bully

01:27:32.551 --> 01:27:33.422
of them all.

01:27:35.119 --> 01:27:36.773
Thanks.

01:27:36.816 --> 01:27:39.819
So, it's all over the news.

01:27:39.863 --> 01:27:41.865
Everyone at school
is asking about you.

01:27:41.908 --> 01:27:43.519
No they're not.

01:27:43.562 --> 01:27:46.261
You're the only one
that knows my name.

01:27:46.304 --> 01:27:47.871
Not anymore.

01:27:47.914 --> 01:27:49.351
They all do.

01:27:49.394 --> 01:27:50.569
I don't think
that we're gonna be

01:27:50.613 --> 01:27:51.962
going back there.

01:27:52.005 --> 01:27:53.442
We're moving again?

01:27:53.485 --> 01:27:54.399
Yeah, why?

01:27:56.096 --> 01:27:57.837
I mean, you own that
house now, right?

01:27:57.881 --> 01:27:59.709
And I mean, it is pretty sweet

01:27:59.752 --> 01:28:02.581
and it's got its own pool.

01:28:02.625 --> 01:28:03.974
Besides, this new
job, it pays better

01:28:04.017 --> 01:28:05.323
than your old one, right?

01:28:05.367 --> 01:28:06.716
Well, technically yes.

01:28:06.759 --> 01:28:08.152
Mom.

01:28:08.195 --> 01:28:09.719
The monster is gone.

01:28:11.111 --> 01:28:12.199
I think you said
once that you have

01:28:12.243 --> 01:28:13.723
a right to be happy.

01:28:13.766 --> 01:28:14.767
Well I think that
we all have a right

01:28:14.811 --> 01:28:15.725
to be happy.

01:28:18.162 --> 01:28:20.425
I vote that we stay

01:28:20.469 --> 01:28:22.601
and we stop running.

01:28:22.645 --> 01:28:24.864
I second that vote.

01:28:24.908 --> 01:28:25.648
Third.

01:28:30.348 --> 01:28:31.697
Okay.

01:28:31.741 --> 01:28:33.351
Yes.

01:28:33.395 --> 01:28:34.613
We'll stay.

01:28:37.529 --> 01:28:40.358
So can I get ice cream?

01:28:40.402 --> 01:28:42.186
Yes, you can get ice cream.

01:28:42.229 --> 01:28:43.013
I think it's...

01:28:43.056 --> 01:28:44.493
This one?

01:28:44.536 --> 01:28:45.624
What happened to your eye?

01:28:45.668 --> 01:28:47.452
Oh, it's...

01:28:47.496 --> 01:28:48.671
It'll heal.

01:28:48.714 --> 01:28:51.151
Yeah, but what happened.

01:28:51.195 --> 01:28:52.936
Punched.

01:28:52.979 --> 01:28:54.285
Maybe ice cream
on it would help.

01:28:54.329 --> 01:28:55.678
Who punched you?

01:28:58.202 --> 01:28:59.899
Yeah, we can get
some ice cream on it,

01:28:59.943 --> 01:29:00.900
what flavor do you want?

01:29:00.944 --> 01:29:02.032
Chocolate.

01:29:02.075 --> 01:29:03.076
What flavor do you want?

01:29:03.120 --> 01:29:04.121
I'm fine with chocolate.

01:29:04.164 --> 01:29:05.035
What flavor do you want?

01:29:05.078 --> 01:29:05.557
Chardonnay.

01:29:05.601 --> 01:29:06.384
Yeah.
