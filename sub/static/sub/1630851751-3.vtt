WEBVTT

00:07.173 --> 00:10.309
NARRATOR: Worldwide,
36 billion cameras

00:10.377 --> 00:15.314
are watching us --
On our streets, at work,

00:15.348 --> 00:17.216
and in our homes,

00:17.283 --> 00:20.719
they capture things
that seem impossible.

00:20.754 --> 00:23.789
Science says
this shouldn't happen.

00:23.857 --> 00:25.524
Do you see that?

00:25.558 --> 00:28.227
NARRATOR: Experts carry out
forensic analysis

00:28.294 --> 00:29.561
of these unusual events.

00:29.629 --> 00:31.063
Wow, what a blast!

00:34.034 --> 00:35.567
[screaming]

00:35.635 --> 00:37.669
This doesn't make sense.

00:37.737 --> 00:39.772
There has to be
some sort of explanation.

00:39.839 --> 00:41.974
What else is going on here?

00:43.343 --> 00:46.078
NARRATOR: Coming up,
on Zombie Island,

00:46.146 --> 00:50.382
is this funeral the end
or just a new beginning?

00:50.450 --> 00:52.484
Did I just -- is that a hand?

00:52.519 --> 00:55.187
Local legend suggests
that these bodies can

00:55.254 --> 00:58.757
make their own way
back to the village.

00:58.825 --> 01:00.959
NARRATOR: Three friends
encounter a series of

01:00.994 --> 01:03.028
mysterious explosions.

01:08.735 --> 01:10.569
That energy went off
sequentially --

01:10.637 --> 01:12.438
[makes rapid noise]
just like that,

01:12.505 --> 01:14.506
like a huge run of explosives.

01:16.176 --> 01:19.111
To me, it suggests that
something is supercharging

01:19.179 --> 01:21.013
this explosion.

01:21.081 --> 01:23.615
NARRATOR: And the rise
of Sky Walker

01:23.683 --> 01:25.818
at an African ceremony.

01:25.885 --> 01:27.119
This is really wild.

01:27.153 --> 01:30.122
This man appears to be defying
the laws of physics.

01:30.156 --> 01:33.158
There certainly seems to be
some sort of force

01:33.226 --> 01:34.326
lifting this man into the air,

01:34.360 --> 01:36.028
but the question is, what is it?

01:38.331 --> 01:41.066
- NARRATOR: Bizarre phenomena.
- Oh, my God. [gasps]

01:41.134 --> 01:42.968
NARRATOR: Mysteries caught
on camera.

01:43.036 --> 01:44.470
[screaming]

01:44.537 --> 01:48.273
What's the truth behind
this strange evidence?

01:56.883 --> 02:00.252
Now, Manado, Indonesia.

02:06.593 --> 02:09.027
May 5th, 2020.

02:09.062 --> 02:12.798
In a graveyard,
a mourner at a funeral films

02:12.866 --> 02:16.802
as a man is laid to rest in
a coffin with a glass window.

02:18.071 --> 02:20.205
LOVELL: Oh, my gosh.
What was that?

02:20.273 --> 02:21.206
What was that?

02:21.274 --> 02:23.208
Did I just -- is that a hand?

02:24.277 --> 02:27.112
NARRATOR: The dead man's hand
seems to be moving inside

02:27.180 --> 02:31.416
the coffin, waving like
a desperate cry for help.

02:31.484 --> 02:34.319
It makes you wonder
if rather than a funeral,

02:34.354 --> 02:39.725
we're actually watching a huge
and horrifying mistake.

02:47.534 --> 02:49.868
NARRATOR: The grieving family
doesn't seem to notice

02:49.936 --> 02:52.137
that their dead relative
appears to be

02:52.205 --> 02:53.672
moving inside their coffin,

02:53.740 --> 02:57.009
or perhaps they expect it.

02:58.678 --> 03:00.145
On this particular island,

03:00.213 --> 03:03.448
some locals believe their
relatives bodies can be very

03:03.483 --> 03:06.785
active indeed,
after their death.

03:08.254 --> 03:11.056
Years after a person's
funeral, relatives

03:11.090 --> 03:15.527
dig up their decaying bodies
and throw a party for the dead.

03:15.595 --> 03:17.196
Some people refer
to their dead as

03:17.263 --> 03:20.799
the "Rolang," or the corpses
that stand up.

03:20.867 --> 03:23.068
I think we would more likely
refer to them

03:23.136 --> 03:24.603
as "the walking dead."

03:25.872 --> 03:28.607
NARRATOR: Shocking images show
the living as they bring

03:28.641 --> 03:31.310
the dead back to
their villages for rituals

03:31.377 --> 03:33.011
and ceremonies.

03:33.079 --> 03:36.815
They'll take their dead aunt
or their dead grandmother

03:36.883 --> 03:38.917
for a walk from the burial cave

03:38.985 --> 03:41.086
back to the village,
dress them up a bit,

03:41.154 --> 03:43.021
give them something to eat,
take them back.

03:43.056 --> 03:47.326
So they never seem to part
company with their own dead.

03:48.861 --> 03:51.763
NARRATOR: Indeed, some corpses
are said to not even need

03:51.831 --> 03:53.765
their relatives' help.

03:53.833 --> 03:57.369
Local legends suggest that
these bodies can make their own

03:57.403 --> 04:01.740
way back to the village with
the assistance of shaman.

04:01.808 --> 04:04.142
NARRATOR: Shaman,
powerful local priests,

04:04.210 --> 04:06.478
are said to be
able to use zombifying

04:06.546 --> 04:09.248
black magic
to reanimate the corpses

04:09.315 --> 04:11.850
so they can stagger by
themselves back to

04:11.918 --> 04:13.752
their former homes.

04:13.819 --> 04:16.388
From an Indonesian point of
view, where they have

04:16.422 --> 04:18.590
the belief that
the dead can potentially,

04:18.658 --> 04:21.260
with the help of a shaman,
rise and walk,

04:21.294 --> 04:23.895
then perhaps it wouldn't be
as alarming to them that

04:23.963 --> 04:26.598
somebody was moving
within their coffin,

04:26.666 --> 04:29.601
even though they were
absolutely, empirically dead.

04:34.040 --> 04:36.775
NARRATOR: Physician Siobhan
Deshauer looks at the video

04:36.842 --> 04:39.311
and wonders if
this may not be a corpse

04:39.379 --> 04:43.115
but a living person
trapped in a nightmare.

04:43.182 --> 04:44.516
While it's very rare,

04:44.583 --> 04:46.885
there's some medical
conditions where a person will

04:46.953 --> 04:49.788
appear to be dead,
but they're really not.

04:49.856 --> 04:53.325
The Victorians were horrified
and almost obsessed with

04:53.392 --> 04:56.561
the thought of being buried
alive, so much so that they even

04:56.629 --> 04:59.164
had arrangements to have
a small bell in the coffin,

04:59.232 --> 05:01.833
just in case they needed to
warn the outside world that

05:01.901 --> 05:03.935
they weren't actually dead.

05:04.003 --> 05:07.039
We may mock the Victorians,
but here we are

05:07.073 --> 05:10.542
with the possibility that
it's actually happening today.

05:10.610 --> 05:12.377
NARRATOR: The horrific
possibility of being

05:12.412 --> 05:14.346
accidentally buried alive

05:14.414 --> 05:17.149
may seem like something
that modern medical science

05:17.216 --> 05:19.751
conquered decades ago,
-[man shouting]

05:19.819 --> 05:23.355
but terrifying recent accounts
come from all over the world.

05:23.422 --> 05:26.458
Even doctors will diagnose them
as having deceased.

05:26.492 --> 05:28.727
And sometimes, these people
can wake up just before

05:28.795 --> 05:32.297
an autopsy or just before
or during a burial.

05:34.067 --> 05:36.968
NARRATOR: In 2018,
an inmate at a prison

05:37.036 --> 05:39.604
in Spain is certified as dead

05:39.639 --> 05:42.808
by three doctors after
being found motionless in

05:42.842 --> 05:45.310
his cell.
- SAMUEL: Subsequently,

05:45.378 --> 05:50.015
he was sent to autopsy, and he
awoke before they cut him open.

05:52.752 --> 05:55.787
NARRATOR: But the horror
can be much worse.

05:55.855 --> 05:58.657
In the same year,
a 37-year-old woman

05:58.725 --> 06:00.192
from Brazil is buried

06:00.259 --> 06:03.729
after being pronounced dead
by septic shock.

06:03.796 --> 06:07.532
11 days later, locals living
near the cemetery hear

06:07.600 --> 06:09.334
screaming from her grave.

06:09.402 --> 06:12.804
[distant screaming]

06:14.006 --> 06:16.541
Soon after,
desperate family members are

06:16.609 --> 06:18.944
said to have exhumed her corpse.

06:19.011 --> 06:22.948
What they find is as tragic
as it is shocking.

06:23.015 --> 06:25.550
The lid of her coffin is loose,
and the woman

06:25.618 --> 06:27.886
is covered in injuries
that weren't there

06:27.954 --> 06:29.721
when she was buried.

06:29.789 --> 06:32.357
It's as if she had been
trying to escape,

06:32.425 --> 06:34.960
but ended up dying
a terrifying death,

06:35.027 --> 06:36.895
trapped in her own coffin.
- [distant shouting]

06:36.963 --> 06:40.098
Being buried alive,
that is my worst nightmare.

06:44.270 --> 06:47.305
NARRATOR: Biologist Leslie
Samuel discovers a medical

06:47.373 --> 06:50.709
condition that can make it seem
like a patient has died,

06:50.776 --> 06:53.912
one that baffles
even modern medicine.

06:53.980 --> 06:56.715
Catalepsy turns the living
into the dead

06:56.782 --> 07:00.952
by dropping the heart rate
and breathing down to levels

07:01.020 --> 07:02.854
below the norm for humans.

07:03.923 --> 07:07.092
NARRATOR: A person suffering
from catalepsy can also

07:07.126 --> 07:10.262
become stiff as though
going through rigor mortis

07:10.329 --> 07:12.631
and will be less
sensitive to pain.

07:13.800 --> 07:16.535
Doctors around the world have
been fooled by conditions like

07:16.602 --> 07:20.639
catalepsy, so we can't
rule it out at this point.

07:20.706 --> 07:23.141
SAMUEL: The way that hand
kind of raises up as

07:23.209 --> 07:26.244
if this person is coming out
of a deep sleep,

07:26.279 --> 07:27.345
it kind of leads me to believe

07:27.413 --> 07:30.248
that this person
was alive the whole time.

07:30.283 --> 07:31.216
Could it be that

07:31.284 --> 07:33.552
Indonesian doctors
have just made a mistake,

07:33.619 --> 07:36.254
and they're about to bury
this guy alive?

07:39.292 --> 07:42.027
NARRATOR: Coming up, does
the corpse have a companion

07:42.094 --> 07:43.895
inside its coffin?

07:43.963 --> 07:44.896
If nothing else,

07:44.964 --> 07:48.600
this is a great advert
for being cremated.

07:48.668 --> 07:50.702
NARRATOR:
And Matt Kutcher investigates

07:50.770 --> 07:53.472
as a city mysteriously
erupts from below.

07:53.539 --> 07:56.708
That energy went off
sequentially [makes rapid noise]

07:56.775 --> 07:59.811
just like that,
like a huge run of explosives.

08:07.753 --> 08:10.322
NARRATOR: On an island
famous for its zombies,

08:10.389 --> 08:13.625
a mourner films as bizarre
movements appear

08:13.693 --> 08:16.761
to take place inside a coffin.

08:18.030 --> 08:19.998
Biologist Greg Szulgit suspects

08:20.065 --> 08:22.567
the shocking clip
is horrific evidence that

08:22.602 --> 08:25.570
the corpse is not alone
in its casket.

08:25.638 --> 08:27.506
Another possibility
is that a rat or some

08:27.540 --> 08:29.274
other animal has got
inside of the coffin,

08:29.342 --> 08:31.076
and it's feasting on the corpse,

08:31.143 --> 08:34.479
which, of course, means that it
could be moving the arm around

08:34.547 --> 08:36.081
as it chews on the body.

08:36.148 --> 08:40.385
Could a rat-infestation
have caused his hand to move?

08:40.419 --> 08:42.854
[rat squeaking]

08:42.955 --> 08:46.258
NARRATOR: Rats in morgues are
a problem all over the world.

08:46.292 --> 08:48.860
In 2017 in India,

08:48.928 --> 08:51.129
the body of a 21-year-old woman

08:51.163 --> 08:55.800
was found chewed by rats
as it lay in a hospital.

08:55.868 --> 09:00.305
In 2007 in Washington,
D.C., rodents get into

09:00.373 --> 09:04.809
a hospital and find their way
to the building's morgue.

09:04.877 --> 09:06.912
Rats were chewing on bodies.

09:06.979 --> 09:10.315
And if rats can do that in
well-maintained hospitals

09:10.382 --> 09:13.518
in America, certainly in
a rural part of Indonesia,

09:13.586 --> 09:16.521
we would expect that rats should
be able to access a body.

09:16.589 --> 09:19.724
And that's pretty repulsive to
think of a coffin

09:19.792 --> 09:20.859
overrun by rodents.

09:20.927 --> 09:23.995
NARRATOR: Whatever was moving
inside the coffin,

09:24.063 --> 09:28.567
the truth is now buried under
six feet of earth, and so far,

09:28.601 --> 09:32.671
no one has been brave enough
to dig up the body to find out.

09:32.738 --> 09:34.573
The sad thing about this case is

09:34.640 --> 09:36.775
that will actually never
know the truth.

09:36.809 --> 09:38.777
So if he did come back to life,

09:38.844 --> 09:41.580
I hope that his second ending
was a swift one.

09:41.614 --> 09:42.681
If nothing else,

09:42.748 --> 09:45.984
this is a great advert
for being cremated.

09:53.392 --> 09:55.160
NARRATOR: Now,

09:55.227 --> 09:58.530
Kaohsiung City, Taiwan.

10:04.704 --> 10:08.239
July 31st, 2014,

10:08.307 --> 10:10.642
12:16 a.m.

10:10.710 --> 10:13.445
Three friends driving home
from a night out

10:13.512 --> 10:16.047
wait at a junction in
the center of town.

10:16.115 --> 10:18.550
Looks like a very quiet night
that you would see

10:18.584 --> 10:20.552
in any city.
- NARRATOR: Then...

10:26.659 --> 10:29.294
NARRATOR: A mysterious explosion
rips through the road.

10:29.362 --> 10:32.030
[inhales sharply]
Oh, my God.

10:33.265 --> 10:34.699
NARRATOR:
A moped rider narrowly

10:34.767 --> 10:37.602
misses the blast,
then swerves to avoid

10:37.670 --> 10:40.405
a huge fireball rising
into the air.

10:42.775 --> 10:45.610
Wow, this is really bad.

10:45.678 --> 10:47.779
NARRATOR: The panicked men
tried to escape,

10:47.813 --> 10:51.016
but a thick cloud of smoke
blocks their path...

10:51.083 --> 10:56.187
[speaking in foreign language]

10:56.222 --> 10:58.723
followed by a raging
column of fire.

11:03.896 --> 11:07.032
It looks like someone just
opened the gates of Hell.

11:07.099 --> 11:09.634
NARRATOR: Something cuts
the power along the street.

11:09.702 --> 11:12.070
[speaking in foreign language]

11:15.441 --> 11:18.443
NARRATOR: And the car is rocked
by another blast of flames.

11:21.013 --> 11:23.148
WOLSHON: It almost looks
like a war zone.

11:23.182 --> 11:25.750
I've never seen anything
like this before, ever.

11:30.389 --> 11:33.191
NARRATOR: Military historian
Martin Morgan believes

11:33.225 --> 11:34.726
these explosions could be

11:34.794 --> 11:37.395
a terrible legacy
from World War II,

11:37.463 --> 11:41.099
when Japan brutally took over
the islands in the Pacific.

11:41.167 --> 11:45.003
As the Japanese strengthened
their island outposts,

11:45.071 --> 11:49.207
they tended to fortify them,
and these islands are often

11:49.275 --> 11:50.408
lava rock,

11:50.476 --> 11:52.911
and lava rock can be quite
easy for tunneling.

11:52.978 --> 11:54.512
So the Japanese made use of

11:54.580 --> 11:56.414
the terrain that was available
to them,

11:56.448 --> 12:00.085
and these islands
are extensively tunneled.

12:00.119 --> 12:02.454
NARRATOR: Japanese troops hid
in these tunnels to mount

12:02.488 --> 12:05.824
surprise attacks on invading
American forces.

12:05.891 --> 12:09.427
U.S. casualties were twice
as high on some islands,

12:09.495 --> 12:12.731
where troops had to wage
so-called cave warfare,

12:12.798 --> 12:15.734
than on islands
with standard beach defenses.

12:15.801 --> 12:17.936
On Iwo Jima alone,

12:18.003 --> 12:21.439
almost 7,000 U.S. troops
were killed.

12:21.507 --> 12:24.342
There are tunnels today
at almost every other

12:24.376 --> 12:27.445

Japanese cave network.

12:34.286 --> 12:36.254
NARRATOR:
In Keelung, Northern Taiwan,

12:36.321 --> 12:40.492
a 164-foot-long tunnel served
as a bomb shelter and for

12:40.559 --> 12:43.228
ammunition storage throughout
World War II.

12:44.363 --> 12:48.099
And in Kaohsiung,
an 850-foot-long tunnel

12:48.167 --> 12:52.003
was carved deep underground
and used by Japanese forces

12:52.071 --> 12:54.205
as a command center.

12:54.273 --> 12:55.473
Historians believe

12:55.541 --> 12:58.076
there could be scores of
munitions tunnels throughout

12:58.144 --> 12:59.677
Taiwan, abandoned

12:59.745 --> 13:02.981
by the Japanese at the end of
World War II.

13:03.048 --> 13:05.950
Who knows how many
weapons were left behind by

13:06.018 --> 13:07.719
the Japanese in Taiwan?

13:07.753 --> 13:11.389
Maybe some of them were hidden
inside these tunnels.

13:11.423 --> 13:12.624
NARRATOR:
But Morgan suspects

13:12.691 --> 13:14.959
the blast could be the result
of a deliberate

13:15.027 --> 13:17.896
and devastating tactic used by
the Japanese

13:17.963 --> 13:19.631
in their fortified tunnels.

13:21.100 --> 13:23.868
MORGAN: American fighting forces
learned a dark lesson,

13:23.936 --> 13:25.236
and that is

13:25.304 --> 13:27.539
that when you approached
a Japanese tunnel,

13:27.606 --> 13:29.541
you had to be very careful
with it, because they were

13:29.575 --> 13:30.942
often booby trapped.

13:31.010 --> 13:34.145
They might set off
a landmine or a hand grenade.

13:34.213 --> 13:36.447
NARRATOR: Morgan believes one of
these tunnels could have been

13:36.515 --> 13:39.250
disturbed by modern
construction workers,

13:39.318 --> 13:42.453
causing the terrifying blasts
seen in the footage.

13:42.521 --> 13:46.024
There's a possibility that there
may be unexploded booby traps

13:46.058 --> 13:47.325
on that island to this day,

13:47.392 --> 13:50.495

one finally going off,

13:50.563 --> 13:51.496

since World War II,

14:01.807 --> 14:05.176
So any unexploded ordnance

discovered long ago in prior

an idea about where
the explosion originated.

17:34.419 --> 17:37.655
This was actually probably
a sewer line that was, uh...

17:37.689 --> 17:40.658
restricting the explosive
charge, which then

17:40.726 --> 17:43.161
made it worse --
They have this massive amount

17:43.228 --> 17:45.963
of flammable, combustible
material in them.

NARRATOR: And this was
no regular gas leak.

18:40.219 --> 18:41.652
A standard gas leak would not

18:41.687 --> 18:44.822
cause nearly this level
of destruction.

18:44.890 --> 18:45.957
To me, it suggests that

18:46.024 --> 18:49.427
something is supercharging
this explosion.

a pressure drop in one

18:56.668 --> 19:00.204
of their pipelines running
through the sewer system.

called propene.

19:15.253 --> 19:18.656
It's a substance widely used
in the plastics industry.

19:18.724 --> 19:22.860
It burns hotter than propane
and is heavier than air.

19:22.928 --> 19:24.862
What we have here is almost

19:24.930 --> 19:28.766
a three-mile-long pipe bomb
ready to explode.

19:30.536 --> 19:34.038
NARRATOR: It takes five months

NARRATOR: In 2013,
a farmer in Patagonia comes

23:50.228 --> 23:53.464
across a gigantic bone
buried in the dirt.

23:55.333 --> 23:58.369
Paleontologists find
that it's an eight-foot-long

23:58.437 --> 24:01.472
dinosaur thigh bone,
the largest ever to be

24:01.540 --> 24:04.074
discovered -- experts believe

24:04.142 --> 24:06.477
it belonged to
the mighty Titanosaurus.

24:07.813 --> 24:10.147
At over a hundred
and twenty feet in length,

24:10.215 --> 24:13.451
it's longer than ten elephants
standing end to end

24:13.518 --> 24:15.653
and may have been
the largest creature

24:15.720 --> 24:19.723
to ever walk on land
over 65 million years ago.

24:20.892 --> 24:23.727
GROWICK: One swish of their tail
could cut you right in half.

24:23.795 --> 24:26.230
They were eating thousands
of pounds of food a day.

24:26.298 --> 24:28.332
In fact, when they went
to the bathroom,

24:28.400 --> 24:29.934
we're talking about
three gallons

24:30.001 --> 24:31.535
every time they went number two.

24:32.804 --> 24:35.139
NARRATOR: Dinosaurs are known
for being big,

24:35.206 --> 24:37.641
but here in current-day
South America,

24:37.676 --> 24:42.446
they were incredibly big, and
scientists can't explain why.

24:44.349 --> 24:47.284
Paleontologists have
discovered giant creatures

24:47.352 --> 24:49.854
of this region were not
just limited to the land.

24:51.523 --> 24:53.991
Enormous marine reptiles
once hunted

24:54.025 --> 24:56.293
Patagonia's ancient waterways.

24:57.629 --> 25:00.030
Things like Mosasaur,
Ichthyosaur,

25:00.032 --> 25:03.267
and Plesiosaur,
a long-neck, carnivorous

25:03.335 --> 25:04.368
aquatic animal.

25:07.839 --> 25:11.876
NARRATOR: In 2019
paleontologists Excavating near

25:11.910 --> 25:13.477
a Patagonian lake

25:13.545 --> 25:15.379
discover the fossil of a giant

25:15.447 --> 25:18.949
xiphactinus fish measuring
20 feet long,

25:19.017 --> 25:22.052
the size of a small school bus.

25:22.120 --> 25:23.454
GROWICK: These guys were
incredibly scary,

25:23.521 --> 25:27.458
swimming at upwards of 40 miles
an hour, giant teeth, and would

25:27.525 --> 25:28.826
eat pretty much anything

25:28.894 --> 25:32.129
they came across -- one
xiphactinus specimen was found

25:32.197 --> 25:35.933
with an entire undigested
six-foot-long fish in

25:36.001 --> 25:37.034
its stomach.

25:37.102 --> 25:38.836
That's a size of me, a fully

25:38.904 --> 25:41.438
grown human being,
swallowed in one bite.

25:41.506 --> 25:43.741
BLACKBURN:
Today, the great white shark is

25:43.808 --> 25:45.776
the apex predator of the ocean.

25:45.844 --> 25:47.912
But this thing could have
literally eaten it

25:47.979 --> 25:49.213
for breakfast.

25:49.280 --> 25:51.382
It's possible these fish
cruise along the top of

25:51.416 --> 25:53.284
the water, something
I definitely would not

25:53.351 --> 25:56.086
want to be kayaking
anywhere near.

25:56.154 --> 25:58.389
NARRATOR: It's possible certain
types of this creature

25:58.423 --> 26:00.958
grew even bigger as
they have evolved over

26:01.025 --> 26:02.092
the millennia.

26:02.160 --> 26:04.361
MORGAN: Because of
the remoteness of the area,

26:04.429 --> 26:08.365
this particular lake is
a good candidate for being

26:08.433 --> 26:12.269
the natural habitat of
an ancient dinosaur-like

26:12.337 --> 26:14.271
swimming creature
that's still alive.

26:14.339 --> 26:17.074
Maybe not the original
creature, but the descendants of

26:17.142 --> 26:18.175
this creature,

26:18.243 --> 26:20.177
and it may be that we're
looking at footage of it.

26:21.346 --> 26:23.247
NARRATOR: Whatever is
lurking in the lake,

26:23.314 --> 26:25.950
the authorities are taking
no chances.

26:27.319 --> 26:29.954
The authorities have banned
people going onto it

26:29.988 --> 26:31.055
after dark.

26:31.122 --> 26:33.290
So what do they know that
we don't?

26:33.325 --> 26:35.826
BELLINGER: This lake is
absolutely massive.

26:35.894 --> 26:39.229
There are plenty of corners
for this creature to hide,

26:39.297 --> 26:41.332
as long as it might desire.

26:41.399 --> 26:45.135
So until this creature
chooses to surface again,

26:45.203 --> 26:46.704
it's gonna remain a mystery.

26:46.771 --> 26:53.410
♪

26:53.478 --> 26:56.780
NARRATOR: Now,
Northwestern Zambia, Africa.

27:02.821 --> 27:04.655
August 2018.

27:06.324 --> 27:08.292
In a rural Village, a camera

27:08.359 --> 27:11.662
films an object hanging
in midair.

27:11.730 --> 27:14.465
- Oh, my God. Wow.
- This is really bizarre.

27:14.499 --> 27:15.699
NARRATOR: It's a man,

27:15.767 --> 27:19.570
and he seems to be levitating
10 feet above the ground.

27:19.671 --> 27:22.306
This is really wild --
This man appears to be

27:22.374 --> 27:23.974
defying the laws of physics.

27:24.042 --> 27:26.076
The strangest part is when
these officials with

27:26.144 --> 27:28.078
the sashes come on,
and it's almost like

27:28.146 --> 27:29.847
they're telling people,
"Put your cameras down.

27:29.914 --> 27:31.548
You can't film this."

27:31.583 --> 27:34.652
There certainly seems to be
some sort of force

27:34.719 --> 27:35.653
lifting this man into the air,

27:35.720 --> 27:37.454
but the question is, what is it?

27:44.095 --> 27:47.498
NARRATOR: The average human
weighs 136 pounds.

27:47.532 --> 27:49.700
Lifting that kind of
weight requires

27:49.768 --> 27:52.102
some kind of known
physical force.

27:53.672 --> 27:55.506
But author Jeff Belanger finds

27:55.573 --> 27:58.375
reports that seem
to defy explanation.

27:58.443 --> 28:02.012
Legend and lore the world over
has talked about some people

28:02.080 --> 28:03.847
having the ability to levitate.

28:03.882 --> 28:04.948
These people claim.

28:05.016 --> 28:07.384
They're able to draw on
some miraculous energy

28:07.419 --> 28:10.187
from the spiritual realm in
order to do this.

28:11.423 --> 28:12.756
NARRATOR:
Many Catholic saints

28:12.824 --> 28:15.092
are believed to have
this bizarre ability.

28:17.228 --> 28:20.364
St. Francis of Assisi
is said to have hovered

28:20.432 --> 28:24.368
high in the air during prayer
in the 13th century.

28:24.436 --> 28:25.669
In the 17th century,

28:25.737 --> 28:29.073
St. Joseph of Cupertino
was said to levitate while

28:29.140 --> 28:30.774
saying mass.

28:30.842 --> 28:33.377
During that time,
anywhere in the world,

28:33.445 --> 28:36.380
really, talk of levitation
would be witchcraft.

28:36.448 --> 28:39.550
St. Joseph was confined
to a cell for this

28:39.584 --> 28:41.251
very practice.

28:41.319 --> 28:44.054
NARRATOR: Levitation is also
associated with sinister

28:44.122 --> 28:45.622
poltergeist phenomena.

28:47.358 --> 28:51.228
In 1977 in London, England,
11-year-old

28:51.262 --> 28:55.899
Janet Hodgson was said by
eyewitnesses to have levitated.

28:55.967 --> 28:58.102
She claimed that she was
possessed by

28:58.169 --> 29:01.705
a man who lived in the house
years before.

29:01.773 --> 29:05.709
Many people say that they
actually saw her levitating.

29:05.744 --> 29:08.612
Even passerbys and say that
they can see her through her

29:08.679 --> 29:11.582
bedroom window,
levitating above the ground.

29:15.320 --> 29:17.287
NARRATOR: Coming up,
is this man

29:17.355 --> 29:20.991
being lifted by a higher power
or dark forces?

29:21.025 --> 29:23.360
There's a ritual where
a shaman will perform,

29:23.428 --> 29:25.996
and during the ceremony,
will actually rise up above

29:26.030 --> 29:27.264
the ground.

29:27.332 --> 29:30.467
NARRATOR: And cabin fever --
As an airplane fills with

29:30.535 --> 29:32.269
a strange smog.

29:32.337 --> 29:34.772
So you're strapped into
a plane seat.

29:34.839 --> 29:36.874
There's nowhere to run,
and it looks like

29:36.941 --> 29:38.475
the plane is on fire.

29:45.183 --> 29:46.950
NARRATOR: In Zambia,
multiple cameras,

29:47.018 --> 29:50.354
capture a mysterious man who
appears to be levitating in

29:50.388 --> 29:53.257
front of an astonished crowd.

29:53.324 --> 29:54.525
Jeff Belanger wonders

29:54.592 --> 29:56.960
if the clip shows
a man who claims to have

29:56.995 --> 29:58.962
supernatural powers.

29:58.997 --> 30:01.932
Judging from the costumes
being worn and the chanting

30:02.000 --> 30:04.134
and the music playing behind
this whole event,

30:04.202 --> 30:06.436
it looks like he's some kind
of shaman.

30:06.504 --> 30:07.838
In many African cultures,

30:07.906 --> 30:10.340
it's believed that Shaman
are able to travel between

30:10.408 --> 30:12.276
our world
and the spiritual realm

30:12.343 --> 30:14.711
and even have the ability
to heal people.

30:14.746 --> 30:17.481
So this gives them
an elevated social status.

30:17.548 --> 30:20.117
NARRATOR: Shamans in some
regions of Africa

30:20.185 --> 30:23.620
are still thought to possess
supernatural powers.

30:23.688 --> 30:25.389
A West African shaman

30:25.423 --> 30:27.591
is filmed in
astonishing footage shot

30:27.659 --> 30:29.326
in 2016,

30:29.360 --> 30:32.496
appearing to kill a man and
then miraculously bring him

30:32.564 --> 30:34.064
back to life.

30:34.098 --> 30:37.401
Scientists believe it's nothing
but a gruesome magic trick,

30:37.468 --> 30:40.404
but the crowd are transfixed
by the shaman's apparent

30:40.538 --> 30:43.574
command of both life and death.

30:43.641 --> 30:46.243
They believe what
they witnessed was real.

30:46.311 --> 30:48.045
NARRATOR: Other shamans
are said to be able to

30:48.112 --> 30:52.149
enter a deep trance state
and somehow defy gravity,

30:52.183 --> 30:54.251
like the man in the footage.

30:54.319 --> 30:56.954
There's a ritual where
a shaman will perform at night

30:56.988 --> 30:58.355
in a ring of fire,

30:58.389 --> 31:00.958
and during the ceremony,
will actually rise up above

31:00.992 --> 31:02.059
the ground.

31:02.126 --> 31:04.628
NARRATOR: When historian
Karen Bellinger

31:04.696 --> 31:07.231
discovers the month in which
the footage was shot,

31:07.298 --> 31:10.868
she finds it coincides
with an ancient ritual.

31:10.935 --> 31:14.238
This region
is known for a very specific,

31:14.305 --> 31:18.575
very special ritual called
the Makishi Masquerade,

31:18.643 --> 31:21.812
and it happens every August --
This celebration marks

31:21.880 --> 31:24.915
the end of an initiation
period for young boys in

31:24.983 --> 31:28.018
this society
known as the mukanda.

31:28.085 --> 31:30.020
The event involves boys ages

31:30.087 --> 31:32.222
8 to 12, where they'll spend
three months in

31:32.290 --> 31:36.126
the bush, and it symbolizes
the death of their childhood.

31:36.160 --> 31:39.029
For the mukanda, this has
an educational function.

31:39.096 --> 31:40.397
You're learning survival skills.

31:40.531 --> 31:41.865
You're learning about sexuality,

31:41.933 --> 31:44.668
about religious beliefs,
social structure,

31:44.736 --> 31:46.770
and everything else
they need to be adults.

31:48.606 --> 31:51.675
NARRATOR: Throughout history all
over the world, young boys

31:51.743 --> 31:55.045
participate in extreme rites
of passage to signify

31:55.113 --> 31:56.847
the end of their childhood.

31:58.182 --> 32:00.517
The Mandan tribe of
North America

32:00.584 --> 32:05.622
had a really extreme ritual in
which young boys would have

32:05.690 --> 32:09.259
a strip kind of cut open in
their skin, in their chest

32:09.327 --> 32:13.830
and shoulders, and a thick rod
of would thrust through.

32:13.898 --> 32:15.832
They would then be hung by that

32:15.900 --> 32:18.135
until they passed out
from the pain.

32:19.404 --> 32:20.938
NARRATOR: The young boys
would then have their

32:21.005 --> 32:24.441
little fingers hacked off by
a tribesman.

32:24.509 --> 32:28.312
The pain was not pointless --
It was meant to secure

32:28.379 --> 32:29.880
the approval of the spirits

32:29.948 --> 32:32.215
and attune them
to the spiritual world.

32:32.283 --> 32:36.620
The Satere-Mawe people of
Brazil have a particularly

32:36.687 --> 32:39.423
shocking coming of age ceremony

32:39.490 --> 32:43.860
where the young people put
gloves on their hands,

32:43.928 --> 32:47.664
but the gloves are lined
with bullet ants.

32:47.732 --> 32:50.567
NARRATOR: Bullet ants, known as
the world's most painful

32:50.635 --> 32:53.270
insects, are named for
the extreme agony

32:53.338 --> 32:55.872
just one sting can cause.

32:55.940 --> 32:58.375
These are intensely

32:58.442 --> 33:02.646
painful stings that they
received dozens of in each hand,

33:02.714 --> 33:04.848
and they have to leave
the gloves on for

33:04.916 --> 33:06.249
several minutes.

33:06.317 --> 33:09.052
The pain causes them to go
into a trance-like

33:09.120 --> 33:11.822
state before they're able
to take the gloves off.

33:17.996 --> 33:20.063
NARRATOR: Athena Brensberger
studies the clip

33:20.131 --> 33:22.733
closely and spots a wooden pole,

33:22.800 --> 33:26.436
erected at the height of
the apparently floating man.

33:26.471 --> 33:28.238
The way this man is positioned

33:28.306 --> 33:30.440
would indicate
there's a thin wire that

33:30.475 --> 33:33.510
he's holding onto
and possibly balancing on.

33:33.544 --> 33:35.812
You could see a pole,
which would make me think if

33:35.880 --> 33:39.816
there's a wire, it may be tied
between the trees and the pole.

33:39.884 --> 33:41.685
David Blaine's
got nothing on this guy.

33:41.752 --> 33:44.855
He's doing this
in the middle of a crowd.

33:44.922 --> 33:47.491
They've all got camera phones.

33:47.558 --> 33:49.760
It's definitely daring --
If it's a wire,

33:49.827 --> 33:52.362
it's got to be like razor-thin,
and I mean, razor.

33:52.430 --> 33:53.563
It's got to be painful.

33:53.631 --> 33:56.266
NEMZER: If you watch the person
who's in the video,

33:56.334 --> 33:58.368
this is a particularly
good example

33:58.436 --> 34:02.072
of a levitation or a suspension,
if you will, because

34:02.140 --> 34:04.975
not only is there absolutely
nothing above them,

34:05.043 --> 34:06.643
but it's done outdoors.

34:06.710 --> 34:09.446
So you know
it's not relying on any of

34:09.514 --> 34:11.948
the technical aid of what
you would get in

34:12.016 --> 34:13.550
a fully-equipped theater.

34:13.584 --> 34:16.053
Normally, when you observe
a tightrope walker,

34:16.120 --> 34:19.723
you can see a big, sturdy wire
that they're balancing on.

34:19.790 --> 34:23.160
This man must be using
an incredibly thin wire

34:23.194 --> 34:26.430
to present the illusion that
he's floating in mid-air.

34:26.497 --> 34:28.231
SZULGIT: He's not just
walking from one

34:28.299 --> 34:30.100
side to the other,
he's dancing --

34:30.168 --> 34:33.236
The strength and balance
that this must take are

34:33.304 --> 34:36.706
incredible -- a performance like
this must take years to master.

34:36.808 --> 34:38.809
NARRATOR: Reports
of the ceremony confirm

34:38.876 --> 34:41.378
this man isn't trying
to fool the crowd.

34:41.412 --> 34:43.580
He is trying to entertain them.

34:43.648 --> 34:46.483
The adult man is taking part
in the celebrations

34:46.550 --> 34:48.885
after the initiation ritual.

34:48.953 --> 34:51.688
The officials are keeping
the crowd under control

34:51.755 --> 34:52.989
so the man doesn't lose

34:53.024 --> 34:56.860
concentration and suffer
a terrible injury if he falls.

34:58.729 --> 35:01.965
When young kids in Western
society finish school,

35:02.033 --> 35:03.266
they'll go to the prom.

35:03.334 --> 35:05.669
They'll go out
for a nice dinner.

35:05.736 --> 35:08.071
But this Makishi performer,

35:08.139 --> 35:11.675
he's pulling out all the stops
for these boys who have passed

35:11.709 --> 35:14.744
their initiation ritual
with flying colors.

35:21.519 --> 35:24.654
NARRATOR: Now, Jacksonville
Airport, Florida.

35:24.722 --> 35:31.061
♪

35:31.128 --> 35:33.630
August 11th, 2019.

35:36.901 --> 35:40.036
A plane prepares for takeoff
when suddenly...

35:42.974 --> 35:44.307
That is insane.

35:44.375 --> 35:47.077
The cabin fills
with a bizarre mist.

35:47.145 --> 35:50.380
Panic rises as visibility drops.

35:50.414 --> 35:53.683
This whole flight looks like
it's going up in smoke.

35:53.751 --> 35:56.086
So you're strapped into
a plane seat,

35:56.154 --> 35:58.255
there's nowhere to run,
and it looks like

35:58.289 --> 35:59.656
the plane is on fire.

35:59.724 --> 36:03.760
[sounds of commotion]

36:06.631 --> 36:10.267
NARRATOR: This seems to be the
start of a horrific tragedy.

36:10.334 --> 36:13.870
Over 45,000 people have been
killed in plane disasters

36:13.938 --> 36:15.839
since 1970.

36:15.907 --> 36:19.242
Mechanical failures,
including engine fires, are

36:19.310 --> 36:21.545
the cause of over
twenty percent of all

36:21.579 --> 36:23.146
fatal plane crashes.

36:26.584 --> 36:30.153
But when former CIA agent
Tracy Walder checks reports,

36:30.221 --> 36:32.622
she finds no record of
an engine fire

36:32.690 --> 36:34.624
on the plane that day.

36:34.692 --> 36:37.327
So I think that there's
something else going on here.

36:40.398 --> 36:42.465
NARRATOR: Coming up,
has a passenger

36:42.533 --> 36:45.902
brought a carry-on catastrophe
aboard this jet?

36:45.970 --> 36:48.505
They are attacking huge
amounts of energy into

36:48.573 --> 36:49.906
tiny spaces,

36:49.974 --> 36:54.277
making them highly unstable
and leading to a big risk of

36:54.345 --> 36:55.779
fire and explosions.

37:03.187 --> 37:04.888
NARRATOR:
In Jacksonville, Florida,

37:04.956 --> 37:06.323
passengers on a plane

37:06.390 --> 37:08.892
waiting to take off are
shocked when

37:08.960 --> 37:12.195
a strange, thick fog begins
to fill the cabin.

37:13.864 --> 37:15.098
Liberty Vittert wonders

37:15.166 --> 37:17.968
if something in someone's
luggage has exploded --

37:18.035 --> 37:19.202
Not a bomb,

37:19.270 --> 37:21.571
but an everyday piece
of technology --

37:21.639 --> 37:25.008
A phone, a laptop, or a tablet.

37:25.076 --> 37:28.945
Lithium ion batteries are
packing huge amounts of energy

37:29.013 --> 37:30.280
into tiny spaces,

37:30.348 --> 37:34.684
potentially making them highly
unstable and leading to a big

37:34.752 --> 37:37.053
risk of fire and explosions.

37:38.389 --> 37:40.423
NARRATOR:
Billions of modern devices run

37:40.491 --> 37:43.026
on lithium ion batteries.

37:43.093 --> 37:45.161
Some of the chemicals
that transmit

37:45.229 --> 37:48.331
an electrical charge within
these batteries are flammable.

37:52.503 --> 37:56.706
In 2010, lithium batteries
being carried from Dubai to

37:56.774 --> 37:58.408
Cologne on a cargo flight

37:58.476 --> 38:03.013
overheat and ignite, causing
a lethal fire to break out,

38:03.080 --> 38:04.814
killing everyone on board.

38:06.884 --> 38:08.118
It's only recently that

38:08.185 --> 38:10.887
are travel organizations
have recognized

38:10.955 --> 38:14.324
how dangerous these batteries
can be -- in some cases, lithium

38:14.391 --> 38:17.394
ion batteries are no longer
allowed in checked luggage,

38:17.461 --> 38:20.063
where a fire could start
and go undetected

38:20.130 --> 38:21.498
in the cargo compartment.

38:21.565 --> 38:24.701
But now this danger has just
moved to the overhead bins,

38:24.769 --> 38:28.271
where carry-on bags filled
with batteries are placed right

38:28.339 --> 38:29.673
next to the passengers,

38:29.740 --> 38:32.042
and you never know when one
might spark up

38:32.109 --> 38:33.576
and start a fire.

38:35.146 --> 38:36.746
NARRATOR:
But Ashanti Davis spots

38:36.814 --> 38:39.949
the mystery fog is pouring
from the overhead vents

38:40.017 --> 38:42.752
and suspects this could be
a substance even more

38:42.820 --> 38:46.623
toxic than smoke from
an overheated battery.

38:46.691 --> 38:49.125
Could chemicals from
the complex mechanics of

38:49.160 --> 38:51.428
the aviation system be leaking

38:51.495 --> 38:53.163
into the air
conditioning system?

38:53.230 --> 38:56.833
Exhaust systems should filter
out these poisonous gases,

38:56.901 --> 39:00.637
but there's always a risk that
some could seep in, and the more

39:00.705 --> 39:03.707
that seeps in,
the more the effects.

39:03.774 --> 39:06.810
It may seep in through cracks
and doors,

39:06.877 --> 39:09.612
or through the heating
baffles inside the plane.

39:11.382 --> 39:14.317
A hundred and thirty seven
Japanese passengers faced

39:14.385 --> 39:17.887
this horror during
a flight in 2018.

39:17.955 --> 39:22.125
A damaged power unit caused
a lubricant to leak into

39:22.192 --> 39:26.196
the air conditioning system,
causing some kind of mist to

39:26.263 --> 39:27.497
fill the cabin.

39:27.565 --> 39:31.501
This video looks almost
similar to that scenario.

39:31.569 --> 39:33.503
ORZEL: The passengers on
the Japanese flight

39:33.571 --> 39:35.472
forced to evacuate onto
the runway,

39:35.539 --> 39:38.174
having just inhaled
lubrication oil.

39:38.209 --> 39:40.677
Many of them were very
sick afterwards.

39:41.946 --> 39:43.513
NARRATOR:
But Liberty Vittert thinks

39:43.547 --> 39:44.981
the behavior of the passengers

39:45.049 --> 39:48.585
in the footage rules out
a deadly chemical leak.

39:48.619 --> 39:50.987
If this was some type of
poisonous chemical,

39:51.055 --> 39:53.857
the crew should be evacuating
the plane, since they're still

39:53.924 --> 39:57.093
on the ground, and people should
be getting very dizzy.

39:57.161 --> 39:59.462
So there must be something
else going on here.

40:02.700 --> 40:06.870
NARRATOR: Physicist Chad Orzel
finds the temperatures

40:06.937 --> 40:09.739
outside the plane could have
triggered a terrifying

40:09.774 --> 40:11.608
smog inside.

40:11.675 --> 40:14.844
ORZEL: This plane is in Florida,
which is a very humid region.

40:14.912 --> 40:17.347
This looks like actual fog.

40:17.381 --> 40:21.017
So could this be related to
some strange weather phenomena?

40:21.085 --> 40:23.453
NARRATOR: The temperature
recorded at the airport that

40:23.520 --> 40:25.655
day was a scorching 97 degrees.

40:25.722 --> 40:30.260
A plane's air conditioning
system works by rerouting

40:30.327 --> 40:33.530
excess hot air from
the plane's engine.

40:33.597 --> 40:35.999
This air is cooled by passing
through a series

40:36.066 --> 40:39.002
of mechanical chambers
and turbines before entering

40:39.069 --> 40:40.503
the cabin.

40:40.571 --> 40:42.472
This complex cooling process

40:42.540 --> 40:46.876
generates condensation as
the air reaches the passengers.

40:46.944 --> 40:52.649
So when that are changes from
hot and humid to cold,

40:52.716 --> 40:58.188
some of that condensation will
actually show up as a mist.

40:58.222 --> 41:00.290
NARRATOR: The mist is confirmed
by the airline

41:00.357 --> 41:03.460
to be an unusually
high amount of water vapor,

41:03.527 --> 41:06.763
but the fear and
panic of the passengers is real

41:06.831 --> 41:09.265
and poses a significant danger.

41:09.333 --> 41:11.367
They're lucky that people didn't

41:11.435 --> 41:13.470
go stampeding towards the exits.

41:13.537 --> 41:17.040
While the mist itself may be
harmless, any unexpected event

41:17.107 --> 41:20.944
on a plane risks setting off
a panic among the passengers,

41:20.978 --> 41:22.846
which itself can be deadly.

41:24.515 --> 41:28.251
NARRATOR: In 2010, a stampede
on a Congolese airplane

41:28.318 --> 41:29.953
in flight unbalances

41:30.020 --> 41:33.156
the plane and causes it to
crash with the loss of

41:33.190 --> 41:34.824
20 lives.

41:34.892 --> 41:37.093
The cause of the panic is
rumored to

41:37.127 --> 41:41.898
be a smuggled crocodile
escaped from a passenger's bag.

41:41.966 --> 41:45.201
Airplanes are such
sophisticated machines.

41:45.269 --> 41:49.072
Despite the best engineering
and design,

41:49.139 --> 41:50.773
there's things
that can go wrong.

41:50.841 --> 41:53.042
Even if this mist
is not poisonous,

41:53.110 --> 41:54.277
a flight where you can't see

41:54.345 --> 41:57.180
your fellow passenger is
a recipe for disaster.

41:57.248 --> 41:59.782
[people shouting]
