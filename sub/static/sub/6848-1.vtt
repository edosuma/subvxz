02:14.334 --> 02:16.302
The Hovitos are near.

02:17.670 --> 02:19.934
The poison is still fresh,
three days.

02:20.006 --> 02:21.633
They're following us.

02:23.009 --> 02:26.638
If they knew we were here,
they would've killed us already.

03:51.698 --> 03:54.223
This is it.

03:54.300 --> 03:55.858
This is where Forrestal
cashed in.

03:55.935 --> 03:57.197
A friend of yours?

03:57.270 --> 03:58.202
A competitor.

03:58.271 --> 04:00.569
He was good.

04:00.640 --> 04:02.232
He was very, very good.

04:02.308 --> 04:06.176
Senor... nobody's
come out of there alive.

04:06.246 --> 04:08.214
Please...

04:44.017 --> 04:46.485
Senor.

05:15.415 --> 05:16.746
Stop.

05:16.816 --> 05:18.841
Stay out of the light.

05:41.174 --> 05:43.574
Forrestal.

06:29.589 --> 06:31.580
Let us hurry.
There is nothing to fear here.

06:33.960 --> 06:36.428
That's what scares me.

06:55.014 --> 06:56.276
Stay here.

06:56.349 --> 06:58.317
If you insist, senor.

08:24.604 --> 08:25.832
Give me the whip.

08:25.905 --> 08:27.202
Throw me the idol.

08:29.575 --> 08:31.008
No time to argue.

08:31.077 --> 08:33.341
Throw me the idol,
I throw you the whip.

08:33.412 --> 08:34.879
Give me the whip!

08:34.947 --> 08:36.573
Adios, senor.

09:20.226 --> 09:21.716
Adios, Satipo.

10:01.167 --> 10:03.567
Dr. Jones.

10:03.636 --> 10:06.503
Again we see there is nothing
you can possess

10:06.572 --> 10:08.199
which I cannot take away.

10:08.274 --> 10:10.435
And you thought I had given up.

10:21.053 --> 10:23.578
You chose the wrong friends.

10:23.656 --> 10:25.920
This time, it will cost you.

10:27.893 --> 10:30.157
Too bad the Hovitos...

10:30.229 --> 10:33.460
don't know you the way I do,
Belloq.

10:33.532 --> 10:35.090
Yes, too bad.

10:35.167 --> 10:37.328
You could warn them,

10:37.403 --> 10:40.031
if only you spoke Hovitos.

11:26.452 --> 11:28.215
Jock! Start the engines!

11:28.287 --> 11:29.914
Get it up!

11:33.893 --> 11:36.589
Jock, the engines!

11:36.662 --> 11:38.926
Start the engines, Jock!

12:27.646 --> 12:30.843
There's a big snake
in the plane, Jock!

12:30.916 --> 12:33.714
Oh, that's just
my pet snake Reggie!

12:33.786 --> 12:36.050
I hate snakes, Jock!

12:36.122 --> 12:37.248
I hate 'em!

12:37.323 --> 12:40.656
Come on!
Show a little backbone, will ya?

12:56.242 --> 12:58.472
''Neo,'' meaning ''new''

12:58.544 --> 13:02.139
and ''lithic''... l-T-H...

13:03.182 --> 13:04.911
...l-C, meaning ''stone.''

13:04.984 --> 13:06.611
All right, let's get back
to this site:

13:06.685 --> 13:08.915
Turkdean Barrow, near Hazelton.

13:09.021 --> 13:14.152
Contains a central pas-passage
and three chambers, or cysts...

13:18.063 --> 13:22.523
...don't confuse that with
robbing, in which case we mean

13:22.601 --> 13:25.570
the removal of the contents
of the barrow.

13:25.638 --> 13:27.538
This site also demonstrates...

13:29.208 --> 13:32.109
...one of the great dangers
of archaeology--

13:32.178 --> 13:35.375
not to life and limb, although
that does sometimes take place--

13:35.447 --> 13:37.847
no, I'm talking about folklore.

13:37.917 --> 13:39.612
In this case,
local tradition held

13:39.685 --> 13:42.176
that there was golden coffin
buried at the site,

13:42.254 --> 13:45.781
and this accounts for the holes
dug all over the barrow

13:45.858 --> 13:48.725
and the generally poor condition
of the find.

13:48.794 --> 13:51.729
However, chamber three
was undisturbed,

13:51.797 --> 13:53.822
and the undisturbed chamber
and the grave goods

13:53.899 --> 13:55.298
that were found in another, uh--

13:55.367 --> 13:57.699
in the area, give us a r--

13:59.171 --> 14:00.365
Uh...

14:01.941 --> 14:04.432
...reason to da--
to, uh, to-to date this,

14:04.510 --> 14:06.137
uh, find as we have.

14:06.212 --> 14:07.179
Um...

14:08.214 --> 14:10.182
Any questions, then?

14:10.249 --> 14:12.046
No? Okay, that's it
for the day, then.

14:12.117 --> 14:13.379
Um, don't forget--

14:13.452 --> 14:18.287
Michaelson, chapters four
and five for next time.

14:18.357 --> 14:20.450
And I will be in my office
on Thursday, but not Wednesday.

14:30.769 --> 14:32.532
I had it, Marcus.

14:32.605 --> 14:34.232
I had it in my hand.

14:34.306 --> 14:35.534
What happened?

14:35.608 --> 14:37.235
Guess.

14:38.477 --> 14:39.501
Belloq?

14:39.578 --> 14:40.670
You want to hear about it?

14:40.746 --> 14:42.145
Not at all.

14:42.214 --> 14:44.148
I'm sure everything you do
for the museum

14:44.216 --> 14:45.911
conforms to
the International Treaty

14:45.985 --> 14:47.350
for the Protection
of Antiquities.

14:47.419 --> 14:48.909
It's beautiful, Marcus.

14:48.988 --> 14:49.920
I can get it.

14:49.989 --> 14:51.047
I got it all figured out.

14:51.123 --> 14:52.681
There's only one place
he can sell it: Marrakech.

14:52.758 --> 14:53.850
I need $2,000. Look--

14:53.926 --> 14:54.858
Listen to me, old boy.

14:54.927 --> 14:56.326
I brought some people
to see you.

14:56.395 --> 14:57.327
Look.

14:57.396 --> 14:58.488
I got these pieces.

14:58.564 --> 15:00.088
They're good pieces, Marcus.

15:00.165 --> 15:02.190
-Look.
-Indiana...

15:02.268 --> 15:05.203
Yes, the museum will buy them,
as usual, no questions asked.

15:05.271 --> 15:06.829
Yes, they are nice.
They're worth at least

15:06.906 --> 15:08.237
the price
of a ticket to Marrakech.

15:08.307 --> 15:09.501
But the people
I brought are important,

15:09.575 --> 15:10.507
and they're waiting.

15:10.576 --> 15:11.508
What people?

15:11.577 --> 15:13.442
Army Intelligence.

15:13.512 --> 15:15.002
They knew you were coming
before I did.

15:15.080 --> 15:16.342
Seem to know everything.

15:16.415 --> 15:18.406
They wouldn't tell me
what they want.

15:18.484 --> 15:20.918
Well, what do I want
to see them for?

15:21.020 --> 15:22.544
What am I, in trouble?

15:22.621 --> 15:23.815
Yes, Dr. Jones,

15:23.889 --> 15:25.356
we've heard a great deal
about you.

15:25.424 --> 15:27.221
Have you?

15:27.293 --> 15:29.488
Uh, professor of archaeology,

15:29.561 --> 15:31.028
expert on the occult,

15:31.096 --> 15:33.223
and, uh, how does one say it?

15:33.299 --> 15:35.927
Obtainer of rare antiquities.

15:36.068 --> 15:36.932
That's one way of saying it.

15:37.069 --> 15:37.933
Why don't you sit down?

15:38.070 --> 15:38.934
You'll be more comfortable.

15:39.071 --> 15:40.038
-Oh, thank you.
-Thank you.

15:40.105 --> 15:43.404
Yes, you're a man
of many talents.

15:43.475 --> 15:45.841
Now, you studied
under Professor Ravenwood

15:45.911 --> 15:47.572
at the University of Chicago.

15:47.646 --> 15:49.614
Yes, I did.

15:49.682 --> 15:52.412
You have no idea
of his present whereabouts?

15:52.484 --> 15:55.647
Uh... well, just rumors, really.

15:55.721 --> 15:57.382
Somewhere in Asia, I think.

15:57.456 --> 15:59.117
I haven't really spoken
to him for ten years.

15:59.191 --> 16:00.749
We were friends, but, uh...

16:00.826 --> 16:03.727
had a bit of a falling out,
I'm afraid.

16:03.796 --> 16:05.263
Mmm.

16:05.331 --> 16:07.891
Dr. Jones, now,
you must understand

16:08.033 --> 16:11.059
that this is all
strictly confidential, eh?

16:11.136 --> 16:12.068
I understand.

16:12.137 --> 16:14.264
Uh...

16:14.340 --> 16:17.901
Yesterday afternoon,
our European sections

16:17.977 --> 16:20.741
intercepted a...
a German communiquÃ©

16:20.813 --> 16:23.873
that was sent
from Cairo to Berlin.

16:23.949 --> 16:25.780
-Now, to Cairo...
-See, over the last two years,

16:25.851 --> 16:27.614
the Nazis have had teams
of archaeologists

16:27.686 --> 16:28.744
running around the world

16:28.821 --> 16:32.018
looking for all kinds
of religious artifacts.

16:32.091 --> 16:33.422
Hitler's a nut on the subject.

16:33.492 --> 16:34.424
He's crazy.

16:34.493 --> 16:36.552
He's obsessed with the occult.

16:36.628 --> 16:38.493
And, right now, apparently,

16:38.564 --> 16:40.896
there's some kind
of German archaeological dig

16:40.966 --> 16:42.399
going on in the desert
outside of Cairo.

16:42.468 --> 16:44.698
Now, we've got some
information here,

16:44.770 --> 16:47.295
but we can't make anything
out of it, and maybe you can.

16:47.373 --> 16:51.207
''Tanis development proceeding.

16:51.276 --> 16:55.542
''Acquire headpiece, Staff of Ra.

16:55.614 --> 16:58.947
Abner Ravenwood, U.S.''

16:59.051 --> 17:01.246
The Nazis have discovered Tanis.

17:01.320 --> 17:04.585
Just what does that mean to you,
uh, Tanis?

17:04.656 --> 17:05.623
Well, it--

17:05.691 --> 17:07.089
The city of Tanis
is one of the possible

17:07.159 --> 17:08.217
resting places of the Lost Ark.

17:08.292 --> 17:09.885
The Lost Ark?

17:10.029 --> 17:11.257
Yeah, the Ark of the Covenant.

17:11.329 --> 17:12.387
The chest the Hebrews used

17:12.464 --> 17:13.896
to carry around
the Ten Commandments.

17:14.032 --> 17:15.397
What do you mean,
''commandments''?

17:15.467 --> 17:16.866
You talking
about the Ten Commandments?

17:16.935 --> 17:18.459
Yes, the actual
Ten Commandments.

17:18.537 --> 17:19.765
The original stone tablets

17:19.838 --> 17:22.500
that Moses brought down
out of Mount Horeb and smashed,

17:22.574 --> 17:25.065
if you believe
in that sort of thing.

17:25.144 --> 17:27.476
Any of you guys
ever go to Sunday school?

17:27.546 --> 17:28.478
Well, I...

17:28.547 --> 17:29.536
Oh, look.

17:29.615 --> 17:31.207
The Hebrews took
the broken pieces

17:31.283 --> 17:32.443
and put them in the Ark.

17:32.518 --> 17:33.815
When they settled in Canaan,

17:33.886 --> 17:36.377
they put the Ark in a place
called the Temple of Solomon.

17:36.455 --> 17:37.422
In Jerusalem.

17:37.489 --> 17:39.116
Where it stayed for many years.

17:39.191 --> 17:41.523
Until, all of a sudden,
whoosh, it's gone.

17:41.593 --> 17:42.525
Where?

17:42.594 --> 17:44.494
Well, nobody knows
where or when.

17:44.563 --> 17:46.428
However, an Egyptian pharaoh...

17:46.498 --> 17:47.522
-Shishak.
-Yes.

17:47.599 --> 17:50.363
...invaded the city of Jerusalem
right about 980 BC,

17:50.436 --> 17:53.405
and he may have taken the Ark
back to the city of Tanis

17:53.472 --> 17:55.406
and hidden it
in a secret chamber

17:55.474 --> 17:56.941
called the Well of Souls.

17:57.076 --> 17:58.407
Secret chamber?

17:58.477 --> 18:00.069
However, about a year

18:00.145 --> 18:02.545
after the pharaoh
would return to Egypt,

18:02.614 --> 18:05.811
the city of Tanis was
consumed by the desert

18:05.884 --> 18:08.876
in a sandstorm which
lasted a whole year.

18:08.987 --> 18:11.547
Wiped clean by the wrath of God.

18:13.759 --> 18:14.691
Uh-huh.

18:14.760 --> 18:17.160
Obviously, we've come
to the right men.

18:17.229 --> 18:18.787
Now you seem to know, uh,

18:18.864 --> 18:19.990
all about this Tanis, then.

18:20.065 --> 18:21.726
No, no, not really.

18:21.800 --> 18:24.394
Ravenwood is the real expert.

18:24.470 --> 18:25.903
Abner did the first serious work
on Tanis.

18:26.004 --> 18:28.495
Collected some of its relics.

18:28.574 --> 18:31.270
It was his obsession, really.

18:31.343 --> 18:32.867
But he never found the city.

18:32.945 --> 18:36.346
Frankly, we're somewhat
suspicious of Mr. Ravenwood.

18:36.415 --> 18:38.042
An American being mentioned
so prominently

18:38.117 --> 18:40.347
in a secret Nazi cable.

18:40.419 --> 18:41.386
Oh, rubbish.

18:41.453 --> 18:42.750
Ravenwood's no Nazi.

18:42.821 --> 18:44.721
Well, what do the Nazis
want him for, then?

18:44.790 --> 18:46.883
Well, obviously,
the Nazis are looking

18:46.959 --> 18:48.927
for the headpiece
to the Staff of Ra

18:49.027 --> 18:50.585
and they think Abner's got it.

18:50.662 --> 18:54.098
What exactly is a headpiece
to the Staff of Ra?

18:54.166 --> 18:55.565
Well, the staff
is just a stick--

18:55.634 --> 18:56.862
I don't know, about this big,

18:56.935 --> 18:58.562
nobody really knows
for sure how high--

18:58.637 --> 19:01.606
and it's... it's, uh...
it's capped

19:01.673 --> 19:04.369
with an elaborate headpiece...

19:04.443 --> 19:07.469
in the shape of the sun,
with a crystal in the center.

19:07.546 --> 19:09.207
And what you did was

19:09.281 --> 19:11.715
you take the staff
to a special room in Tanis--

19:11.783 --> 19:13.148
a map room with a miniature

19:13.218 --> 19:14.879
of the city all laid out
on the floor--

19:15.020 --> 19:17.181
and if you put the staff
in a certain place,

19:17.256 --> 19:19.986
at a certain time of day,
the sun shone through here

19:20.058 --> 19:22.891
and made a beam that came down
on the floor here...

19:22.995 --> 19:26.897
and gave you the exact location
of the Well of the Souls.

19:26.965 --> 19:29.832
Where the Ark of the Covenant
was kept, right?

19:29.902 --> 19:31.369
Which is exactly what the Nazis
are looking for.

19:31.436 --> 19:34.496
What does this Ark look like?

19:34.573 --> 19:35.904
Uh...

19:36.008 --> 19:37.839
There's a picture of it
right here.

19:42.481 --> 19:44.244
That's it.

19:51.023 --> 19:52.183
Good God.

19:52.257 --> 19:54.691
Yes, that's just
what the Hebrews thought.

19:54.760 --> 19:55.920
Uh...

19:56.028 --> 19:58.496
now, what's that supposed to be
coming out of there?

19:58.564 --> 20:00.555
Lightning...

20:00.632 --> 20:02.600
fire...

20:02.668 --> 20:04.727
power of God or something.

20:06.004 --> 20:07.699
I'm beginning to understand

20:07.773 --> 20:08.933
Hitler's interest in this.

20:09.041 --> 20:10.668
Oh, yes.

20:10.742 --> 20:12.642
The Bible speaks of the
Ark leveling mountains,

20:12.711 --> 20:16.203
and laying waste
to entire regions.

20:16.281 --> 20:20.377
An army which carries
the Ark before it...

20:20.452 --> 20:21.612
is invincible.

20:42.274 --> 20:44.902
You did it, didn't you?

20:44.977 --> 20:46.467
They want you to go for it.

20:46.545 --> 20:48.979
Oh, Marcus!

20:49.047 --> 20:51.743
They want you to get ahold of
the Ark before the Nazis do

20:51.817 --> 20:53.978
and they're prepared
to pay handsomely for it.

20:54.086 --> 20:55.246
And the museum?

20:55.320 --> 20:56.582
The museum gets the Ark
when we're finished?

20:56.655 --> 20:58.020
Oh, yes.

20:59.891 --> 21:02.086
Oh...

21:02.160 --> 21:04.651
The Ark of the Covenant.

21:04.730 --> 21:07.426
Nothing else has come close.

21:07.499 --> 21:08.898
That thing represents everything

21:08.967 --> 21:11.128
we got into archaeology
for in the first place.

21:12.437 --> 21:15.099
Mmm!

21:15.173 --> 21:18.142
You know, five years ago,
I would've gone after it myself.

21:18.210 --> 21:20.371
I'm really rather envious.

21:20.445 --> 21:21.810
I've got to locate Abner.

21:21.880 --> 21:23.541
I think I know where to start.

21:28.754 --> 21:30.915
Suppose she'll
still be with him?

21:30.989 --> 21:32.320
Possibly, but...

21:32.391 --> 21:35.053
Marion's the least
of your worries right now,

21:35.127 --> 21:36.754
believe me, Indy.

21:36.828 --> 21:38.819
What do you mean?

21:38.897 --> 21:41.957
Well, I mean that
for nearly 3,000 years,

21:42.100 --> 21:44.864
man has been searching
for the Lost Ark.

21:44.936 --> 21:49.737
Not something to be taken
lightly.

21:49.808 --> 21:53.767
No one knows its secrets.

21:53.845 --> 21:57.212
It's like nothing you've ever
gone after before.

21:58.517 --> 21:59.643
Oh, Marcus.

21:59.718 --> 22:00.912
What are you trying to do,
scare me?

22:01.019 --> 22:01.917
You sound like my mother.

22:02.020 --> 22:03.419
We've known each other
for a long time.

22:03.488 --> 22:04.420
I don't believe in magic,

22:04.489 --> 22:06.582
a lot of superstitious
hocus-pocus.

22:06.658 --> 22:07.750
I'm going after a find

22:07.826 --> 22:09.760
of incredible
historical significance.

22:09.828 --> 22:11.591
You're talking
about the bogeyman.

22:11.663 --> 22:14.791
Besides, you know
what a cautious fellow I am.

22:25.510 --> 22:26.841
Nice to see you again,
Dr. Jones.

22:26.912 --> 22:27.879
Thank you.

23:41.486 --> 23:42.851
Shh... shh...

24:00.939 --> 24:02.668
Shh...

24:33.538 --> 24:35.506
Give him space!
Give him space!

24:35.574 --> 24:36.973
Go on, Regan!

24:38.677 --> 24:41.077
Shh! Shh!

24:41.146 --> 24:42.579
Shh! Shh! Shh!

25:27.459 --> 25:29.723
Hello, Marion.

25:35.300 --> 25:38.428
Indiana Jones.

25:40.472 --> 25:42.030
Always knew, someday,

25:42.107 --> 25:44.507
you'd come walking back
through my door.

25:44.576 --> 25:46.635
I never doubted that.

25:46.711 --> 25:48.941
Something made it inevitable.

25:49.014 --> 25:51.881
So, what are you doing here
in Nepal?

25:51.950 --> 25:54.942
I need one of the pieces
your father collected.

25:55.020 --> 25:57.784
I learned to hate you
in the last ten years.

25:58.823 --> 26:00.586
I never meant to hurt you.

26:00.659 --> 26:01.819
I was a child.

26:01.893 --> 26:03.087
I was in love.

26:03.161 --> 26:04.992
It was wrong and you knew it!

26:05.063 --> 26:06.325
You knew what you were doing.

26:06.398 --> 26:06.887
Now I do!

26:06.998 --> 26:08.090
This is my place.

26:08.166 --> 26:09.224
Get out!

26:12.370 --> 26:13.302
I did what I did.

26:13.371 --> 26:14.736
You don't have to be happy
about it,

26:14.806 --> 26:16.535
but maybe we could help
each other out now.

26:18.843 --> 26:20.834
I need one of the pieces
your father collected.

26:20.912 --> 26:22.106
Bronze piece, about this size,

26:22.180 --> 26:24.080
with a hole in it, off-center,
with a crystal.

26:24.149 --> 26:25.275
You know the one I mean?

26:25.350 --> 26:27.250
Yeah.

26:27.319 --> 26:28.547
I know it.

26:28.620 --> 26:29.644
Where's Abner?

26:30.722 --> 26:32.622
Where's Abner?

26:32.691 --> 26:33.885
Abner's dead.

26:39.264 --> 26:41.698
Marion, I'm sorry.

26:41.766 --> 26:44.701
Do you know what you did to me,
to my life?

26:44.769 --> 26:47.237
I can only say
I'm sorry so many times.

26:47.305 --> 26:49.068
Well, say it again, anyway.

26:49.140 --> 26:50.164
Sorry.

26:50.241 --> 26:51.936
Yeah, everybody's sorry.

26:52.043 --> 26:54.876
Abner was sorry for dragging me
all over this earth

26:54.946 --> 26:56.937
looking
for his little bits of junk.

26:57.015 --> 26:59.347
I'm sorry to still be
stuck in this dive.

26:59.417 --> 27:02.045
Everybody's sorry for something.

27:02.120 --> 27:04.111
It's a worthless bronze
medallion, Marion.

27:04.189 --> 27:05.451
You going to give it to me?

27:05.523 --> 27:06.547
Maybe.

27:06.625 --> 27:08.388
I don't know where it is.

27:08.460 --> 27:11.896
Well, maybe you could find it.

27:11.963 --> 27:14.431
3,000 bucks.

27:14.499 --> 27:18.333
Well, that will get me back,
but not in style.

27:18.403 --> 27:21.236
I can get you another two
when we get to the States.

27:21.306 --> 27:23.433
It's important, Marion.

27:23.508 --> 27:25.635
Trust me.

27:26.745 --> 27:28.679
You know the piece I mean?

27:28.747 --> 27:30.374
Do you know where it is?

27:33.818 --> 27:35.342
Come back tomorrow.

27:35.420 --> 27:37.513
Why?

27:37.589 --> 27:41.355
Because I said so, that's why.

27:47.932 --> 27:49.126
Ha!

27:49.200 --> 27:51.293
See you tomorrow, Indiana Jones.

28:59.137 --> 29:01.002
Good evening, Fraulein.

29:01.072 --> 29:03.199
The bar's closed.

29:03.274 --> 29:06.300
We... We are...

29:06.377 --> 29:08.311
not thirsty.

29:08.379 --> 29:09.710
What do you want?

29:09.781 --> 29:12.750
The same thing your friend
Dr. Jones wanted.

29:12.817 --> 29:15.377
Surely he told you
there would be

29:15.453 --> 29:17.080
other interested parties.

29:17.155 --> 29:19.646
Must've slipped his mind.

29:19.724 --> 29:23.319
The man is... nefarious.

29:23.394 --> 29:27.660
I hope, for your sake,
he has not yet acquired it.

29:27.732 --> 29:29.996
Why, are you willing
to offer more?

29:30.068 --> 29:33.003
Oh, almost certainly.

29:33.071 --> 29:34.868
Do you still have it?

29:40.245 --> 29:42.042
No.

29:42.113 --> 29:44.946
But I know where it is.

29:46.117 --> 29:48.847
Hey, how about a drink
for you and your men?

29:48.920 --> 29:53.880
Your fire is dying here.

29:53.958 --> 29:56.688
Why don't you tell me
where the piece is right now?

29:56.761 --> 29:58.888
Listen, Herr Mac...

30:00.131 --> 30:03.658
I don't know what kind of people
you're used to dealing with,

30:03.735 --> 30:06.169
but nobody tells me
what to do in my place.

30:06.237 --> 30:09.604
Fraulein Ravenwood,

30:09.674 --> 30:13.508
let me show you
what I am used to.

30:15.613 --> 30:18.980
Take your hands off me!

30:20.852 --> 30:22.979
Take your lousy hands off!

30:29.327 --> 30:30.385
Wait a minute.

30:30.461 --> 30:31.758
Wait, I... I can be reasonable.

30:31.830 --> 30:34.060
That time is passed.

30:34.132 --> 30:35.759
You don't need that.

30:37.769 --> 30:38.861
Wait...

30:40.505 --> 30:41.972
I'll tell you everything.

30:42.073 --> 30:46.339
Yes, I know you will.

30:51.683 --> 30:53.173
Let her go.

32:08.192 --> 32:09.159
Whiskey.

32:18.436 --> 32:19.733
Shoot them.

32:19.804 --> 32:21.533
Shoot them both.

33:16.094 --> 33:17.891
My medallion!

33:25.636 --> 33:28.104
Well, Jones, at least
you haven't forgotten

33:28.172 --> 33:29.935
how to show a lady a good time!

33:30.074 --> 33:31.598
Boy, you're something!

33:31.676 --> 33:32.768
Yeah, I'll tell you what.

33:32.844 --> 33:34.778
Until I get back my $5,000,

33:34.846 --> 33:36.939
you're going to get more
than you bargained for.

33:37.015 --> 33:40.143
I'm your goddamn partner!

34:17.422 --> 34:19.686
Cairo, city of the living.

34:19.757 --> 34:21.485
A paradise on earth.

34:23.327 --> 34:24.487
Silence!

34:24.562 --> 34:26.085
Why do you forget yourselves?

34:26.164 --> 34:27.152
What is this?

34:27.231 --> 34:29.699
Where did this animal come from?

34:32.904 --> 34:34.132
Oh... oh, no.

34:36.541 --> 34:38.168
Cute.

34:38.242 --> 34:40.233
What an adorable creature.

34:42.246 --> 34:44.339
Then it shall be welcome
in our house.

34:44.415 --> 34:46.940
Oh, well, no, you don't have to
keep it here just because of me.

34:55.092 --> 34:57.323
I knew the Germans
would hire you, Sallah.

34:57.395 --> 34:59.454
You're the best digger in Egypt.

34:59.530 --> 35:03.159
My services are entirely
inconsequential to them.

35:03.234 --> 35:06.465
They've hired or shanghaied
every digger in Cairo.

35:06.537 --> 35:08.266
The excavation is enormous.

35:08.339 --> 35:12.298
They hire only strong backs
and they pay pennies for them.

35:12.376 --> 35:15.539
It's as if the pharaohs
had returned.

35:15.613 --> 35:17.240
When did they find the map room?

35:17.315 --> 35:18.907
Three days ago.

35:18.983 --> 35:20.883
They have not one brain
among them.

35:20.952 --> 35:23.284
Except one.

35:23.354 --> 35:25.447
He is very clever.
He's a French archaeologist.

35:27.525 --> 35:29.152
What's his name?

35:29.227 --> 35:30.524
They call him ''Bellosh.''

35:37.001 --> 35:39.868
Belloq. Belloq.

35:39.937 --> 35:42.735
The Germans have
a great advantage over us.

35:42.807 --> 35:45.935
They are near to discovering
the Well of Souls.

35:46.077 --> 35:50.446
Well, they're not
going to find it without this.

35:50.515 --> 35:53.211
Who can tell us
about these markings?

35:56.053 --> 35:58.453
Perhaps a man I know
can help us.

35:59.857 --> 36:01.381
Indy...

36:03.761 --> 36:05.991
there is something
that troubles me.

36:06.063 --> 36:09.032
What is it?

36:09.100 --> 36:11.091
The Ark.

36:11.169 --> 36:13.467
If it is there, at Tanis,

36:13.538 --> 36:16.871
then it is something that man
was not meant to disturb.

36:16.941 --> 36:19.910
Death has always surrounded it.

36:20.044 --> 36:22.308
It is not of this earth.

36:22.380 --> 36:24.109
Do we need the monkey, huh?

36:24.182 --> 36:25.479
I'm surprised at you, Jones--

36:25.550 --> 36:28.178
talking that way about our baby.

36:28.252 --> 36:29.844
He's got your looks, too.

36:29.921 --> 36:30.910
And your brains.

36:31.022 --> 36:32.853
Oops!

36:32.924 --> 36:34.016
I noticed that.

36:34.091 --> 36:36.616
She's a smart little thing--
smart.

36:39.363 --> 36:40.591
Hey!

36:40.665 --> 36:41.893
Hey, where you going?

36:41.966 --> 36:43.695
She'll be all right.
Have a date.

36:47.672 --> 36:48.798
Come on. Come on.

36:48.873 --> 36:49.805
Okay...

36:49.874 --> 36:50.806
Marion.

36:50.875 --> 36:51.864
What's this?

36:51.943 --> 36:53.308
It's a date.

36:53.377 --> 36:54.844
You eat 'em.

37:43.761 --> 37:46.127
How come you haven't found some
nice girl to settle down with,

37:46.197 --> 37:48.131
raise eight or nine kids,
like your friend Sallah?

37:48.199 --> 37:49.223
Who says I haven't?

37:51.302 --> 37:52.394
I do.

37:52.470 --> 37:54.404
Dad had you figured
a long time ago.

38:03.714 --> 38:04.976
He said you were a bum.

38:05.049 --> 38:06.482
Oh, he's being generous.

38:06.550 --> 38:08.541
The most gifted bum
he ever trained.

38:08.619 --> 38:10.519
You know, he loved you
like a son.

38:10.588 --> 38:12.556
Took a hell of a lot
for you to alienate him.

38:12.623 --> 38:13.783
Not much, just you.

38:31.976 --> 38:33.136
Marion, get out of here!

38:33.210 --> 38:34.177
Duck!

39:15.853 --> 39:17.821
Right.

40:00.197 --> 40:02.165
Shh! Shh!

40:08.038 --> 40:09.699
Marion!

40:29.994 --> 40:31.962
Help! Over here, Indy!

40:32.096 --> 40:33.688
Get out of the way!

40:33.764 --> 40:35.163
Move! Move it!

40:36.734 --> 40:37.758
Help me!

40:42.873 --> 40:44.500
You can't do this to me!

40:44.575 --> 40:46.406
I'm an American!

40:46.477 --> 40:48.240
Indy!

40:52.082 --> 40:53.515
Indiana Jones!

40:53.584 --> 40:54.881
Help me, Jones!

41:15.773 --> 41:16.705
Jones!

41:16.774 --> 41:17.741
Marion!

41:21.879 --> 41:23.608
Indy!

42:05.422 --> 42:07.117
Marion...

42:44.862 --> 42:46.591
Dr. Jones.

43:13.390 --> 43:14.687
You looking for me?

43:23.500 --> 43:25.229
Belloq.

43:25.302 --> 43:26.769
Good afternoon, Dr. Jones.

43:26.837 --> 43:28.771
I ought to kill you right now.

43:28.839 --> 43:31.433
Not a very private place
for a murder.

43:32.576 --> 43:35.306
Well, these Arabs don't care
if we kill each other.

43:35.379 --> 43:38.507
They're not going
to interfere in our business.

43:38.582 --> 43:41.449
It was not I who brought
the girl into this business.

43:41.518 --> 43:43.611
Please, sit down
before you fall down.

43:43.687 --> 43:46.281
We can at least behave
like civilized people.

43:57.167 --> 43:59.328
I see your taste in friends
remains consistent.

43:59.403 --> 44:02.429
How odd that it should end
this way for us,

44:02.506 --> 44:05.441
after so many
stimulating encounters.

44:05.509 --> 44:07.306
I almost regret it.

44:07.378 --> 44:08.902
Where shall I find
a new adversary

44:08.979 --> 44:10.913
so close to my own level?

44:11.015 --> 44:12.983
Try the local sewer.

44:15.486 --> 44:18.478
You and I are very much alike.

44:18.555 --> 44:20.921
Archaeology is our religion,

44:20.991 --> 44:25.519
yet we have both fallen
from the purer faith.

44:25.596 --> 44:28.929
Our methods have not differed
as much as you pretend.

44:29.033 --> 44:32.469
I am a shadowy
reflection of you.

44:32.536 --> 44:35.334
It would take only a nudge
to make you like me,

44:35.406 --> 44:37.533
to push you out of the light.

44:37.608 --> 44:41.203
Now you're getting nasty.

44:41.278 --> 44:43.405
You know it's true.

44:43.480 --> 44:45.311
How nice.

44:45.382 --> 44:47.373
Look at this.

44:47.451 --> 44:49.248
It's worthless.

44:49.319 --> 44:51.651
Ten dollars
from a vendor in the street.

44:51.722 --> 44:52.882
But I take it,

44:52.956 --> 44:54.583
I bury it in the sand
for a thousand years,

44:54.658 --> 44:58.458
it becomes priceless...
like the Ark.

44:58.529 --> 45:00.326
Men will kill for it.

45:00.397 --> 45:03.093
Men like you and me.

45:03.167 --> 45:06.227
What about your boss,
der Fuehrer?

45:06.303 --> 45:09.795
I thought he was waiting
to take possession.

45:09.873 --> 45:12.535
All in good time.

45:12.609 --> 45:15.043
When I am finished with it.

45:15.112 --> 45:18.673
Jones, do you realize
what the Ark is?

45:18.749 --> 45:20.717
It's a transmitter.

45:20.784 --> 45:23.582
It's a radio
for speaking to God.

45:23.654 --> 45:25.246
And it's within my reach.

45:26.924 --> 45:30.792
You want to talk to God?

45:30.861 --> 45:32.658
Let's go see Him together.

45:32.730 --> 45:34.527
I've got nothing better to do.

45:35.666 --> 45:38.294
Uncle Indy, come back home now!

45:40.337 --> 45:41.304
Uncle Indy!

45:42.606 --> 45:44.130
Next time, Indiana Jones,

45:44.208 --> 45:46.802
it'll take more than children
to save you.

45:48.212 --> 45:49.577
Uncle Indy!

46:03.627 --> 46:05.254
I thought I would
find you there.

46:05.329 --> 46:07.524
Better than the United
States Marines, eh?

46:16.840 --> 46:18.273
Marion's dead.

46:18.342 --> 46:19.604
Yes, I know.

46:19.676 --> 46:21.803
And me! And me!

46:21.879 --> 46:23.471
I'm sorry.

46:23.547 --> 46:25.276
Life goes on, Indy.

46:25.349 --> 46:27.146
There is the proof.

46:29.153 --> 46:31.087
Uh-oh.

46:31.155 --> 46:32.520
I have much to tell you.

46:32.589 --> 46:35.251
First we will take them home,

46:35.325 --> 46:36.792
and then I will take you
to the old man.

47:27.911 --> 47:30.072
I can't figure out
how Belloq did it.

47:30.147 --> 47:32.581
Where'd he get a copy
of the headpiece?

47:32.649 --> 47:35.914
There are no pictures,
no duplicates of it anywhere.

47:35.986 --> 47:38.921
I tell you only what I saw
with my own eyes:

47:39.022 --> 47:40.353
A headpiece like that one,

47:40.424 --> 47:42.654
except round the edges,
which were rougher.

47:42.726 --> 47:44.785
In the center, the Frenchman
had embedded a crystal,

47:44.862 --> 47:49.731
and... and surrounding
the crystal, on one side,

47:49.800 --> 47:51.461
there were raised markings,
just like that one.

47:53.437 --> 47:56.235
They made their calculations
in the map room?

47:56.306 --> 47:57.671
This morning.

47:57.741 --> 48:00.039
Belloq and the boss German,
Dietrich.

48:00.110 --> 48:02.738
When they came out
of the map room,

48:02.813 --> 48:05.077
they gave us a new spot
in which to dig,

48:05.148 --> 48:07.878
out away from the camp.

48:07.951 --> 48:09.885
The Well of the Souls, huh?

48:10.020 --> 48:13.888
Come, come, look.
Look here... look.

48:13.957 --> 48:15.481
Sit down.

48:15.559 --> 48:17.083
Come, sit down.

48:17.160 --> 48:19.094
What is it?

48:19.162 --> 48:21.357
This is a warning

48:21.431 --> 48:23.865
not to disturb
the Ark of the Covenant.

48:23.934 --> 48:25.526
What about the height
of the staff, though?

48:25.602 --> 48:26.694
Did Belloq get it off of here?

48:26.770 --> 48:27.702
Yes.

48:27.771 --> 48:29.170
It is here.

48:29.239 --> 48:31.070
This were the old way,

48:31.141 --> 48:33.609
this mean six kadam high.

48:33.677 --> 48:34.837
-About 72 inches.
-Wait!

48:38.415 --> 48:41.282
''And take back one kadam

48:41.351 --> 48:45.219
to honor the Hebrew God
whose Ark this is.''

48:57.434 --> 48:59.402
You said their headpiece
only had markings on one side.

48:59.469 --> 49:01.266
Are you absolutely sure?

49:03.273 --> 49:04.968
Belloq's staff is too long.

49:05.042 --> 49:07.806
They're digging
in the wrong place.

49:10.514 --> 49:12.641
I am the monarch of the sea

49:12.716 --> 49:14.581
I am the ruler of the--

49:25.495 --> 49:27.156
Bad dates.

49:42.279 --> 49:44.474
I told you not to be premature

49:44.548 --> 49:46.880
in your communiquÃ© to Berlin.

49:46.950 --> 49:50.249
Archaeology is not
an exact science.

49:50.320 --> 49:52.447
It does not deal
in time schedules.

49:52.522 --> 49:54.513
The fuehrer is not
a patient man.

49:54.591 --> 49:58.027
He demands constant reports,
and he expects progress.

49:58.095 --> 49:59.585
You led me to believe...

49:59.663 --> 50:01.096
Nothing!
I made no promises.

50:01.164 --> 50:03.132
I only said
it looked very favorable.

50:03.200 --> 50:06.465
Besides, with the information
in our possession,

50:06.536 --> 50:08.470
my calculations were correct.

50:08.538 --> 50:10.369
Boy, they're not kidding,
are they?

50:12.242 --> 50:14.210
What time does the sun
hit the map room?

50:14.277 --> 50:16.268
At about 9:00 in the morning.

50:16.346 --> 50:17.472
Not much time, then.

50:17.547 --> 50:20.380
Where are they digging
for the Well of the Souls?

50:20.450 --> 50:23.715
On that ridge...
but the map room's over there.

50:23.787 --> 50:25.084
Let's go, come on.

54:31.633 --> 54:33.191
Sallah.

54:34.236 --> 54:36.067
Sallah!

54:43.879 --> 54:44.868
They're here.

54:55.924 --> 54:57.391
Please, my friend,
what is the matter?

54:57.459 --> 54:59.120
I fetch the water.
I shall get it for you.

55:01.897 --> 55:03.888
If you want water,
I will get you water.

55:04.032 --> 55:05.294
No problem, no problem.

55:19.314 --> 55:20.679
I thought you were dead.

55:20.749 --> 55:22.512
You must have switched baskets.

55:26.888 --> 55:28.116
Are you hurt?

55:28.190 --> 55:30.886
No. You have to get me
out of here, quick.

55:30.959 --> 55:33.257
They're gonna be back
at any minute.

55:33.328 --> 55:34.260
Cut me loose.

55:34.329 --> 55:35.318
Quick.

55:35.397 --> 55:37.888
They keep asking about you.
What you know.

55:42.637 --> 55:44.036
What's wrong?

55:44.106 --> 55:45.038
Cut me loose.

55:45.107 --> 55:46.506
I know where the Ark is, Marion.

55:46.575 --> 55:48.805
The Ark's here?

55:48.877 --> 55:50.504
I'm coming with you, Jones.
Get me out of here!

55:50.579 --> 55:51.910
Cut me loose!
You can't leave me here!

55:51.980 --> 55:53.038
If I take you out of here now,

55:53.115 --> 55:54.582
they'll start combing
the place for us.

55:54.649 --> 55:56.082
Jones, you've got to get me
out of here!

55:56.151 --> 55:58.847
Come on, Jones, are you crazy?!

55:58.920 --> 56:00.353
Marion, I hate to do this,

56:00.422 --> 56:02.982
but if you don't sit
still and keep quiet,

56:03.058 --> 56:05.390
this whole thing
is going to be shot.

56:06.862 --> 56:08.454
I'll be back to get you.

56:08.530 --> 56:10.259
Jones, what's the matter?

56:55.911 --> 56:57.503
That's it.

56:57.579 --> 56:58.671
Who knows?

56:58.747 --> 57:00.738
Perhaps the Ark is still waiting

57:00.816 --> 57:03.284
in some antechamber
for us to discover.

57:03.351 --> 57:07.219
Perhaps there's some vital
bit of evidence which eludes us.

57:07.289 --> 57:08.221
Perhaps...

57:08.290 --> 57:09.985
Perhaps the girl can help us.

57:10.058 --> 57:11.389
My feeling exactly.

57:11.460 --> 57:14.588
She was in possession
of the original piece for years.

57:14.663 --> 57:17.029
She may know much,
if properly motivated.

57:17.098 --> 57:19.566
I tell you,
the girl knows nothing.

57:20.735 --> 57:22.635
I'm surprised
to find you squeamish.

57:22.704 --> 57:24.194
That is not your reputation.

57:24.272 --> 57:25.671
But it needn't concern you.

57:25.740 --> 57:28.231
I have the perfect man
for this kind of work.

57:32.781 --> 57:35.215
Heil Hitler.

58:57.599 --> 58:58.827
Indy! Here!

58:58.900 --> 59:00.834
We've hit stone!

59:03.972 --> 59:05.496
Clear it off.

59:05.574 --> 59:06.939
Come on, find the edges.

59:23.825 --> 59:25.486
Good, good, good.

59:25.560 --> 59:27.118
You see, Indy? You see?

59:27.195 --> 59:29.095
Okay, bring the pry bars in.

59:29.164 --> 59:30.927
As a team, boys! As a team!

59:33.034 --> 59:33.864
Push!

59:39.207 --> 59:40.367
Get 'em in there.

59:40.442 --> 59:41.374
Get 'em under.

59:41.443 --> 59:42.375
Good, good, that's it.

59:42.444 --> 59:43.411
Watch your toes.

59:50.986 --> 59:52.749
Carefully, carefully!

01:00:03.865 --> 01:00:06.425
Sorry, Indy.

01:00:07.502 --> 01:00:09.804
Indy...

01:00:09.871 --> 01:00:12.533
why does the floor move?

01:00:13.875 --> 01:00:15.968
Give me your torch.

01:00:46.307 --> 01:00:48.241
Snakes.

01:00:48.309 --> 01:00:49.640
Why did it have to be snakes?

01:00:53.381 --> 01:00:56.316
Asps.

01:00:56.384 --> 01:00:58.978
Very dangerous.

01:00:59.087 --> 01:01:00.111
You go first.

01:01:19.607 --> 01:01:21.700
If you're trying
to escape on foot,

01:01:21.776 --> 01:01:25.041
the desert is three weeks
in every direction,

01:01:25.113 --> 01:01:26.978
so please, eat something.

01:01:34.022 --> 01:01:36.149
I must apologize
for their treatment of you.

01:01:36.224 --> 01:01:37.350
Yeah. Whose idea was it?

01:01:37.425 --> 01:01:38.517
No food, no water.

01:01:38.593 --> 01:01:40.788
What kind of people
are these friends of yours?

01:01:40.862 --> 01:01:43.797
At this particular time
and place, to do my work,

01:01:43.865 --> 01:01:45.765
they are necessary evils.

01:01:45.834 --> 01:01:47.301
They're not my friends.

01:01:47.368 --> 01:01:49.598
However, with the
right connections,

01:01:49.671 --> 01:01:51.605
even in this part of the world,

01:01:51.673 --> 01:01:54.699
we are not entirely uncivilized.

01:01:56.344 --> 01:01:58.278
It's beautiful.

01:01:58.346 --> 01:02:00.871
I would very much like
to see you in it.

01:02:02.917 --> 01:02:05.044
I'll bet you would.

01:02:08.990 --> 01:02:10.958
All right.

01:02:18.867 --> 01:02:20.960
What do you got to drink
around here?

01:02:23.705 --> 01:02:25.832
We don't have much time.

01:02:25.907 --> 01:02:26.941
Soon they will come to harm you,

01:02:26.941 --> 01:02:27.873
Soon they will come to harm you,

01:02:27.942 --> 01:02:29.933
and I will not be able
to stop them,

01:02:30.011 --> 01:02:32.502
unless you are able
to give me something

01:02:32.580 --> 01:02:34.514
to placate them.

01:02:34.582 --> 01:02:37.517
Some, uh, piece
of information...

01:02:37.585 --> 01:02:40.349
which I can use
to protect you from them.

01:02:40.421 --> 01:02:42.651
I've already told you
everything I know.

01:02:42.724 --> 01:02:45.454
I have no loyalty to Jones.

01:02:45.527 --> 01:02:48.052
He's brought me
nothing but trouble.

01:02:54.469 --> 01:02:56.460
Marion, you are beautiful.

01:03:01.442 --> 01:03:04.673
I don't think
we need a chaperone.

01:03:07.715 --> 01:03:09.205
Steadily.

01:03:09.284 --> 01:03:11.252
Steadily. Whoa!

01:03:13.521 --> 01:03:14.613
Down...

01:03:14.689 --> 01:03:15.781
Down-- Whoa.

01:03:15.857 --> 01:03:16.915
Carefully, carefully!

01:03:17.025 --> 01:03:19.255
You all right, Indy?

01:03:21.930 --> 01:03:26.833
Now gently, boys.
Gently, gently!

01:03:35.076 --> 01:03:35.838
Whoa...

01:03:45.854 --> 01:03:47.151
I told you it will be all right.

01:04:03.738 --> 01:04:05.262
Huh...

01:04:13.414 --> 01:04:15.314
Sallah, get down here!

01:04:34.602 --> 01:04:36.502
You pour.

01:06:29.917 --> 01:06:31.885
Oh, that's good.

01:06:35.156 --> 01:06:36.555
Whoops.

01:06:42.797 --> 01:06:44.458
What is this stuff, Rene?

01:06:46.234 --> 01:06:47.701
I grew up with this.

01:06:49.270 --> 01:06:50.862
It's my family label.

01:07:20.168 --> 01:07:23.660
Well... I have to be
going now, Rene.

01:07:25.473 --> 01:07:28.601
I like you, Rene, very much.

01:07:28.676 --> 01:07:31.338
Perhaps we'll meet someday
under better circumstances.

01:07:35.683 --> 01:07:37.844
We meet again, Fraulein.

01:07:39.454 --> 01:07:41.752
You Americans,
you're all the same.

01:07:43.858 --> 01:07:46.986
Always overdressing
for the wrong occasions.

01:08:17.492 --> 01:08:19.823
Now...

01:08:22.296 --> 01:08:25.026
what shall we talk about?

01:09:42.743 --> 01:09:45.644
All right... take it up!

01:09:45.712 --> 01:09:47.738
Easy!

01:09:49.350 --> 01:09:51.078
You're as stubborn as that girl.

01:09:51.152 --> 01:09:53.779
You like her too much, I think.

01:09:53.854 --> 01:09:58.518
Your methods of archaeology
are too primitive for me.

01:09:58.593 --> 01:10:02.654
You would use a bulldozer
to find a... China cup.

01:10:07.101 --> 01:10:08.898
Shliemann! Wake your men!

01:10:08.970 --> 01:10:11.131
Indy, the torches
are burning out.

01:10:11.205 --> 01:10:13.139
Go on, get out of here.

01:10:13.207 --> 01:10:15.004
Hyah!

01:10:32.893 --> 01:10:34.053
Sallah!

01:10:34.128 --> 01:10:35.117
Hello!

01:10:36.163 --> 01:10:37.095
Hello!

01:10:37.164 --> 01:10:39.758
Why, Dr. Jones,
whatever are you doing

01:10:39.834 --> 01:10:42.325
in such a nasty place?

01:10:42.403 --> 01:10:44.394
Why don't you come on down here!
I'll show you!

01:10:44.472 --> 01:10:45.496
Thank you, my friend,

01:10:45.573 --> 01:10:47.973
but I think we are all
very comfortable up here.

01:10:48.109 --> 01:10:49.303
That's right, isn't it?

01:10:50.411 --> 01:10:52.743
Yes, we are very comfortable
up here.

01:10:54.115 --> 01:10:56.083
So, once again, Jones,

01:10:56.150 --> 01:10:59.278
what was briefly yours
is now mine.

01:10:59.353 --> 01:11:01.844
What a fitting end
to your life's pursuits.

01:11:01.922 --> 01:11:04.413
You're about to become
a permanent addition

01:11:04.492 --> 01:11:06.084
to this archaeological find.

01:11:06.160 --> 01:11:07.422
Who knows?

01:11:07.495 --> 01:11:09.759
In a thousand years,
even you may be worth something.

01:11:12.099 --> 01:11:13.794
Son of a bitch.

01:11:13.868 --> 01:11:15.733
I'm afraid we must be
going now, Dr. Jones.

01:11:15.803 --> 01:11:18.135
Our prize is awaited in Berlin.

01:11:18.205 --> 01:11:20.139
But I do not wish to leave you

01:11:20.207 --> 01:11:22.539
down in that awful place
all alone.

01:11:22.610 --> 01:11:24.441
Slimy pig, you let me go!

01:11:24.512 --> 01:11:25.604
Stop it!

01:11:28.382 --> 01:11:29.906
Marion!

01:11:29.984 --> 01:11:30.951
Hang on.

01:11:32.219 --> 01:11:33.277
Don't...

01:11:33.354 --> 01:11:34.946
-Indy!
-Don't fall!

01:11:35.056 --> 01:11:37.354
Marion, I got you!
I got you! I got you!

01:11:41.128 --> 01:11:43.323
You traitor!
You get your hands off of me!

01:11:51.305 --> 01:11:52.363
Snakes!

01:11:53.908 --> 01:11:55.307
Oh, sh... oh, at your feet!

01:11:56.977 --> 01:11:58.137
The girl was mine!

01:11:58.212 --> 01:11:59.179
She's of no use to us.

01:11:59.246 --> 01:12:01.237
Only our mission
for the fuehrer matters.

01:12:03.684 --> 01:12:05.777
I wonder sometimes, Monsieur,

01:12:05.853 --> 01:12:08.219
if you have that
clearly in mind.

01:12:08.289 --> 01:12:10.223
It was not to be, chÃ©rie.

01:12:10.291 --> 01:12:13.021
You bastards!
I'll get you for this!

01:12:13.094 --> 01:12:15.927
Indiana Jones...

01:12:16.063 --> 01:12:17.030
adieu.

01:12:29.610 --> 01:12:31.544
No!

01:12:40.821 --> 01:12:42.049
Take this.

01:12:42.123 --> 01:12:43.886
Wave it at anything
that slithers.

01:12:43.958 --> 01:12:45.118
Thank you.

01:12:45.192 --> 01:12:47.854
Oh, my God, this whole
place is slithering.

01:12:50.898 --> 01:12:51.956
Indy!

01:12:52.099 --> 01:12:54.693
Ow! Jesus!

01:12:56.370 --> 01:12:58.930
Where did you get this?
From him?

01:12:59.006 --> 01:13:00.337
I was trying to escape.

01:13:00.408 --> 01:13:01.375
No thanks to you.

01:13:01.442 --> 01:13:02.909
How hard were you trying?

01:13:02.977 --> 01:13:04.137
Well, where the hell were you?

01:13:04.211 --> 01:13:05.473
Watch it, watch it.

01:13:05.546 --> 01:13:06.877
What are you doing?!

01:13:06.947 --> 01:13:08.471
For the fire!

01:13:10.551 --> 01:13:12.280
How the hell are we going
to get out of here?

01:13:12.353 --> 01:13:13.820
I'm working on it!
I'm working on it!

01:13:13.888 --> 01:13:15.583
Well, whatever you're
doing, do it faster.

01:13:19.794 --> 01:13:21.193
Ah...

01:13:21.262 --> 01:13:23.093
Where are you going?

01:13:23.164 --> 01:13:24.597
Through that wall.

01:13:24.665 --> 01:13:27.065
Just get ready to run,
whatever happens to me.

01:13:27.134 --> 01:13:28.692
What do you mean by that?

01:13:40.147 --> 01:13:42.672
Indy!

01:13:42.750 --> 01:13:45.514
Damn it! Don't you leave me
down here by myself!

01:14:10.377 --> 01:14:12.140
Indy!

01:14:12.213 --> 01:14:13.373
Here we go!

01:14:13.447 --> 01:14:14.379
Get ready!

01:14:14.448 --> 01:14:18.316
Indy, the torch is going out!

01:14:59.293 --> 01:15:00.726
Indy?

01:15:21.081 --> 01:15:22.810
Marion!

01:15:22.883 --> 01:15:25.374
Look. Look.

01:16:03.457 --> 01:16:05.220
They're going to fly it
out of here.

01:16:05.292 --> 01:16:06.691
When that Ark gets loaded,

01:16:06.760 --> 01:16:08.921
we're already going
to be on the plane.

01:16:13.601 --> 01:16:17.560
Ah, monsieur, let us toast
our success in the desert.

01:16:17.638 --> 01:16:18.832
To the Ark.

01:16:18.906 --> 01:16:20.874
When we are very far
from here.

01:16:20.941 --> 01:16:22.602
That will do.

01:17:14.828 --> 01:17:19.231
Hey, you now-- come here!

01:17:19.299 --> 01:17:20.732
Come here!

01:18:25.966 --> 01:18:27.228
Indy!

01:19:18.252 --> 01:19:20.311
Stay with the Ark!
Stay with the Ark!

01:19:26.026 --> 01:19:26.890
Look out!

01:19:37.704 --> 01:19:39.035
Oh, my God.

01:19:39.106 --> 01:19:39.902
Marion.

01:19:39.973 --> 01:19:42.771
In here! Up here!

01:19:45.445 --> 01:19:46.503
Indy, come on!

01:19:46.580 --> 01:19:47.672
Hold on!

01:19:47.748 --> 01:19:49.716
Move up!
It's gonna blow up!

01:19:51.552 --> 01:19:54.851
It's stuck! Indy!

01:19:56.089 --> 01:19:57.613
I can't push it off!

01:20:27.521 --> 01:20:28.419
It's stuck!

01:20:28.488 --> 01:20:29.921
-Turn it! Turn it!
-It's stuck!

01:20:29.990 --> 01:20:31.116
Turn it there!

01:20:31.191 --> 01:20:32.783
Never mind!
Get back! Get back!

01:20:54.381 --> 01:20:56.747
Get the Ark away from
this place immediately.

01:20:56.817 --> 01:20:58.717
Have it put on the truck.

01:20:58.785 --> 01:21:00.184
We'll fly it out of Cairo.

01:21:00.254 --> 01:21:03.052
And Gobler, I want
plenty of protection.

01:21:09.563 --> 01:21:11.224
Jones.

01:21:17.004 --> 01:21:18.335
Holy smoke, my friends,

01:21:18.405 --> 01:21:20.270
I... I'm so pleased
you're not dead!

01:21:22.042 --> 01:21:23.532
Indy, Indy, we have no time.

01:21:23.610 --> 01:21:24.941
If you still want the Ark,

01:21:25.078 --> 01:21:27.444
it is being loaded
onto a truck for Cairo.

01:21:27.514 --> 01:21:29.379
Truck?

01:21:29.449 --> 01:21:30.643
What truck?

01:21:57.911 --> 01:21:59.173
Let's go!

01:22:07.587 --> 01:22:09.782
Get back to Cairo.

01:22:09.856 --> 01:22:11.915
Get us some transport
to England--

01:22:12.025 --> 01:22:14.926
boat, plane, anything.

01:22:15.062 --> 01:22:16.051
Meet me at Omar's.

01:22:16.129 --> 01:22:17.061
Be ready for me.

01:22:17.130 --> 01:22:18.188
I'm going after that truck.

01:22:18.265 --> 01:22:19.197
How?

01:22:19.266 --> 01:22:20.198
I don't know.

01:22:20.267 --> 01:22:21.757
I'm making this up as I go.

01:25:59.186 --> 01:26:00.710
Ew!

01:28:22.595 --> 01:28:23.562
He's there!

01:29:16.216 --> 01:29:17.911
Idiot! Idiot!

01:30:02.762 --> 01:30:04.923
Everything at last
has been arranged.

01:30:04.998 --> 01:30:06.260
The Ark?

01:30:06.332 --> 01:30:07.321
Is on board.

01:30:07.400 --> 01:30:09.334
Nothing is lacking,
now that you're here.

01:30:09.402 --> 01:30:10.664
Or what is left of you.

01:30:10.737 --> 01:30:11.669
You trust these guys?

01:30:11.738 --> 01:30:13.103
Yes.

01:30:13.173 --> 01:30:15.368
Mr. Katanga.

01:30:19.579 --> 01:30:22.104
Mr. Katanga,
these are my friends.

01:30:22.182 --> 01:30:23.945
They are my family.

01:30:24.017 --> 01:30:26.884
I will hear of it
if they are not treated well.

01:30:26.953 --> 01:30:29.945
My cabin is theirs.

01:30:30.089 --> 01:30:31.681
Mr. Jones...

01:30:31.758 --> 01:30:34.283
I've heard a lot about you, sir.

01:30:34.360 --> 01:30:37.386
Your appearance is exactly
the way I imagined.

01:30:42.302 --> 01:30:44.600
Good-bye.

01:30:46.039 --> 01:30:47.973
Look out for each other.

01:30:48.107 --> 01:30:50.234
I am already missing you.

01:30:52.512 --> 01:30:54.776
You're my good friend.

01:30:56.483 --> 01:30:58.542
Sallah.

01:31:01.855 --> 01:31:04.653
That is for Fayah...

01:31:04.724 --> 01:31:07.192
that is for your children...

01:31:07.260 --> 01:31:09.660
and this is for you.

01:31:14.400 --> 01:31:15.924
Thank you.

01:31:24.611 --> 01:31:29.571
A British tar is a soaring soul

01:31:29.649 --> 01:31:34.211
As free as a mountain bird

01:31:34.287 --> 01:31:37.950
His energetic fist
should be ready to...

01:31:40.393 --> 01:31:42.327
...a dictator...

01:31:48.835 --> 01:31:50.769
Where did you go?

01:31:50.837 --> 01:31:51.895
I'm cleaning up.

01:31:53.473 --> 01:31:55.407
Where'd you get that?

01:31:55.475 --> 01:31:56.874
From him.

01:31:56.943 --> 01:31:58.274
Who him?

01:31:58.344 --> 01:31:59.276
Katanga.

01:31:59.345 --> 01:32:01.245
I got a feeling
I'm not the first woman

01:32:01.314 --> 01:32:02.906
ever to travel
with these pirates.

01:32:03.049 --> 01:32:05.210
It's lovely.

01:32:05.285 --> 01:32:06.217
Yeah?

01:32:06.286 --> 01:32:07.218
Yeah.

01:32:07.287 --> 01:32:08.219
Really?

01:32:08.288 --> 01:32:10.153
Yeah.

01:32:21.334 --> 01:32:23.097
What'd you say?

01:32:30.076 --> 01:32:32.306
Wait... I don't need any help.

01:32:32.378 --> 01:32:34.039
You know you do.

01:32:35.715 --> 01:32:39.207
You're not the man
I knew ten years ago.

01:32:39.285 --> 01:32:43.881
It's not the years, honey,
it's the mileage.

01:32:47.260 --> 01:32:49.160
You are...

01:32:50.430 --> 01:32:52.057
Please, I don't need a nurse.

01:32:52.131 --> 01:32:53.598
-I just want to sleep.
-Don't be such a baby.

01:32:53.666 --> 01:32:54.690
Marion, leave me alone.

01:32:54.767 --> 01:32:56.132
-What is this here?
-Go away.

01:32:56.202 --> 01:32:58.568
Yes, it hurts.

01:32:58.638 --> 01:32:59.935
Ow!

01:33:00.006 --> 01:33:02.133
Well, goddamn it, Indy,
where doesn't it hurt?

01:33:03.776 --> 01:33:05.505
Here.

01:33:11.050 --> 01:33:12.415
Here.

01:33:21.060 --> 01:33:23.028
This isn't too bad.

01:33:32.572 --> 01:33:33.539
Here.

01:33:54.360 --> 01:33:55.327
Jones...

01:33:58.131 --> 01:34:00.190
Jones?!

01:34:02.669 --> 01:34:06.435
We never seem to get
a break, do we?

01:34:32.765 --> 01:34:34.164
What is it?

01:34:34.233 --> 01:34:35.598
Engines have stopped.

01:34:35.668 --> 01:34:37.101
I'm going to go check.

01:34:47.947 --> 01:34:48.879
What's happening?

01:34:48.948 --> 01:34:50.210
We have most important friends.

01:34:50.283 --> 01:34:51.910
Holy shit.

01:34:53.653 --> 01:34:54.415
I sent my man for you.

01:34:54.487 --> 01:34:55.579
You and the girl must disappear.

01:34:55.655 --> 01:34:56.644
We have a place in the hold.

01:34:56.723 --> 01:34:57.348
Come on, go, go, go.

01:34:57.423 --> 01:34:58.390
Come on, go, my friend, go.

01:35:11.170 --> 01:35:13.502
Where is Dr. Jones?

01:35:13.573 --> 01:35:14.505
What's the big idea?

01:35:14.574 --> 01:35:15.871
Let go!

01:35:20.046 --> 01:35:22.776
Don't you touch me.

01:36:06.859 --> 01:36:08.690
What about Jones?

01:36:08.761 --> 01:36:11.059
There's no trace yet, sir.

01:36:11.130 --> 01:36:13.223
Jones is dead.

01:36:14.567 --> 01:36:16.762
I killed him.

01:36:16.836 --> 01:36:18.804
He was of no use to us.

01:36:18.871 --> 01:36:23.899
This girl, however, has certain
value where we're headed.

01:36:24.043 --> 01:36:26.534
She'll bring a very good price.

01:36:26.612 --> 01:36:27.544
Mmm?

01:36:27.613 --> 01:36:31.208
Herr Colonel,
that cargo you've taken--

01:36:31.284 --> 01:36:33.184
if it's your goal,
go in peace with it,

01:36:33.252 --> 01:36:34.344
but leave us the girl.

01:36:34.420 --> 01:36:36.320
It would reduce our loss
on this trip.

01:36:36.389 --> 01:36:38.084
Savage!

01:36:38.157 --> 01:36:41.718
You are not in the position
to ask for anything.

01:36:41.794 --> 01:36:43.694
We will take what we wish.

01:36:43.763 --> 01:36:45.458
And then decide whether or not

01:36:45.531 --> 01:36:47.499
to blow your ship
from the water.

01:36:50.736 --> 01:36:52.135
The girl goes with me.

01:36:52.205 --> 01:36:54.503
She'll be part
of my compensation.

01:36:54.574 --> 01:36:56.940
I'm sure your fuehrer
would approve.

01:36:57.009 --> 01:36:58.704
If she fails to please me,

01:36:58.778 --> 01:37:00.837
you may do with her as you wish.

01:37:00.913 --> 01:37:03.711
I will waste
no more time with her now.

01:37:03.783 --> 01:37:04.875
Excuse me.

01:37:21.300 --> 01:37:23.029
I can't find Mr. Jones, Captain.

01:37:23.102 --> 01:37:24.364
I've looked everywhere.

01:37:24.437 --> 01:37:26.905
He's got to be here somewhere.

01:37:27.006 --> 01:37:28.098
Look again.

01:37:30.009 --> 01:37:31.806
-I found him.
-Where?

01:37:31.878 --> 01:37:32.708
There.

01:39:59.025 --> 01:40:01.255
The altar has been
prepared in accordance

01:40:01.327 --> 01:40:03.192
with your radio instructions,
sir.

01:40:03.262 --> 01:40:04.286
Good.

01:40:04.363 --> 01:40:05.830
Take the Ark there immediately.

01:40:07.500 --> 01:40:09.195
Monsieur...

01:40:11.704 --> 01:40:13.865
I am uncomfortable
with the thought

01:40:13.939 --> 01:40:16.499
of this... Jewish ritual.

01:40:18.044 --> 01:40:20.410
Are you sure it's necessary?

01:40:20.479 --> 01:40:22.379
Let me ask you this:

01:40:22.448 --> 01:40:26.578
Would you be more comfortable
opening the Ark in Berlin,

01:40:26.652 --> 01:40:28.449
for your fuehrer?

01:40:28.521 --> 01:40:29.783
Finding out, only then,

01:40:29.855 --> 01:40:32.881
if the sacred pieces
of the Covenant are inside?

01:40:32.958 --> 01:40:33.947
Knowing, only then,

01:40:34.093 --> 01:40:36.084
whether you have accomplished
your mission,

01:40:36.162 --> 01:40:39.222
and obtained the one true Ark?

01:42:07.620 --> 01:42:08.917
Hello!

01:42:11.524 --> 01:42:12.684
Jones.

01:42:13.993 --> 01:42:15.392
Jones!

01:42:15.461 --> 01:42:17.554
I'm going to blow up the Ark,
Rene.

01:42:23.435 --> 01:42:27.599
Your persistence
surprises even me.

01:42:27.673 --> 01:42:30.141
You're going to give
mercenaries a bad name.

01:42:30.209 --> 01:42:32.837
Dr. Jones...

01:42:35.347 --> 01:42:37.872
surely you don't think you can
escape from this island.

01:42:37.950 --> 01:42:40.942
That depends on how reasonable
we're all willing to be.

01:42:41.020 --> 01:42:43.181
All I want is the girl.

01:42:47.359 --> 01:42:49.088
If we refuse?

01:42:49.161 --> 01:42:52.961
Then your fuehrer has no prize.

01:42:53.032 --> 01:42:54.294
Okay, stand back.

01:42:54.366 --> 01:42:55.628
All of you, stand back.

01:42:55.701 --> 01:42:57.293
Stand back.

01:42:57.369 --> 01:42:58.495
Okay, Jones.

01:42:58.571 --> 01:43:01.734
You win!

01:43:01.807 --> 01:43:03.240
Blow it up.

01:43:08.981 --> 01:43:10.107
Yes, blow it up!

01:43:12.451 --> 01:43:14.442
Blow it back to God.

01:43:14.520 --> 01:43:16.545
All your life has been spent

01:43:16.622 --> 01:43:19.182
in pursuit
of archaeological relics.

01:43:19.258 --> 01:43:23.718
Inside the Ark are treasures
beyond your wildest aspirations.

01:43:23.796 --> 01:43:28.130
You want to see it open
as well as I.

01:43:28.200 --> 01:43:30.464
Indiana...

01:43:30.536 --> 01:43:34.768
we are simply passing
through history.

01:43:34.840 --> 01:43:35.966
This...

01:43:38.677 --> 01:43:40.304
This is history.

01:43:49.488 --> 01:43:51.854
Do as you will.

01:46:26.845 --> 01:46:29.211
Marion, don't look at it.

01:46:29.281 --> 01:46:30.305
Shut your eyes, Marion.

01:46:30.382 --> 01:46:32.282
Don't look at it,
no matter what happens.

01:46:43.896 --> 01:46:46.421
Ah...

01:47:00.446 --> 01:47:03.210
It's beautiful!

01:47:13.325 --> 01:47:14.451
Indy?

01:47:14.526 --> 01:47:15.788
Don't look, Marion!

01:47:15.861 --> 01:47:17.260
Keep your eyes shut!

01:48:35.307 --> 01:48:36.433
Marion.

01:49:09.007 --> 01:49:12.067
You've done your country a
great service, and we thank you

01:49:12.144 --> 01:49:16.547
and we trust you found
the settlement satisfactory.

01:49:16.615 --> 01:49:17.707
Oh, the money's fine.

01:49:17.783 --> 01:49:19.614
The situation's
totally unacceptable.

01:49:19.685 --> 01:49:20.617
Well, gentlemen,

01:49:20.686 --> 01:49:22.415
I guess that just about
wraps it up.

01:49:22.487 --> 01:49:24.318
Where is the Ark?

01:49:24.389 --> 01:49:27.552
I thought we'd settled that.

01:49:27.626 --> 01:49:29.890
The Ark is somewhere very safe.

01:49:29.962 --> 01:49:31.088
From whom?

01:49:31.163 --> 01:49:34.223
The Ark is a source
of unspeakable power

01:49:34.299 --> 01:49:36.392
and it has to be researched.

01:49:36.468 --> 01:49:39.562
And it will be,
I assure you, Dr. Brody,

01:49:39.638 --> 01:49:40.764
Dr. Jones.

01:49:40.839 --> 01:49:44.400
We have top men
working on it right now.

01:49:45.777 --> 01:49:46.937
Who?

01:49:48.647 --> 01:49:50.911
Top men.

01:49:54.186 --> 01:49:56.450
Hey, what happened?

01:49:56.521 --> 01:49:57.579
You don't look very happy.

01:49:57.656 --> 01:49:59.590
Fools. Bureaucratic fools.

01:49:59.658 --> 01:50:00.682
What'd they say?

01:50:00.759 --> 01:50:03.819
They don't know
what they've got there.

01:50:03.895 --> 01:50:07.262
Well, I know what I've got here.

01:50:07.332 --> 01:50:08.594
Come on.

01:50:08.667 --> 01:50:10.066
I'll buy you a drink.

01:50:12.004 --> 01:50:13.938
You know...

01:50:14.006 --> 01:50:15.997
a drink?
