09:37.141 --> 09:39.100
Thank you.Mm-hmm.

09:41.885 --> 09:45.236
Jharrel, I'm worried
about this event.

09:45.280 --> 09:47.761
I can't tell if Rev
is in our corner or not,

09:47.804 --> 09:50.198
and I don't trust whatever
the government has planned.

09:50.241 --> 09:52.374
Yeah, me neither.

09:52.417 --> 09:53.767
All right? But I do trust

09:53.810 --> 09:56.508
that Carla knows
what she's doing.

09:56.552 --> 09:59.207
Look, one way to beat them
at their own game

09:59.250 --> 10:01.862
is to get the public
on the 4,400's side.

10:01.905 --> 10:04.386
And what about
the conservatorships?

10:04.429 --> 10:06.388
Well, it'll be harder
for them to utilize

10:06.431 --> 10:08.433
those unlawful tactics.

10:08.477 --> 10:09.739
The world rallies
around the people

10:09.783 --> 10:10.958
that they're trying to suppress.

10:13.264 --> 10:14.614
[sighs]

10:16.137 --> 10:18.879
So, one big, happy family

10:18.922 --> 10:21.098
with Logan it is.

10:21.142 --> 10:22.186
[sighs]

10:27.627 --> 10:29.106
I'm sure they would
love to have someone

10:29.150 --> 10:31.456
with your press savvy
to participate, LaDonna.

10:31.500 --> 10:33.502
I, for one, am
staying far away.

10:34.721 --> 10:38.550
Yes, I have explored
the machine you left,

10:38.594 --> 10:41.031
and I am searching
for the remainder

10:41.075 --> 10:43.468
of the COBOL code.

10:43.512 --> 10:44.469
I...

10:44.513 --> 10:46.515
Actually, I'm on a mission

10:46.558 --> 10:48.212
regarding that
at this very moment.

10:48.256 --> 10:50.562
I'm so sorry, but I will
check in again soon.

10:54.915 --> 10:57.352
Hello, my good sir.Uh, hey.

10:57.395 --> 10:58.745
You know, how's it going, doc?

10:58.788 --> 11:01.312
Well, I miss my partner
in mystery.

11:01.356 --> 11:02.966
How is LaDonna doing
at her dad's?

11:03.010 --> 11:05.316
She seems glad to be there,

11:05.360 --> 11:07.188
and for that I am gratified,

11:07.231 --> 11:10.844
but I would like to follow up
on something she was working on.

11:10.887 --> 11:13.673
Do you happen to have any more
of your brother Manny's books?

11:14.674 --> 11:15.979
You know what, I was actually

11:16.023 --> 11:17.720
about to head
to Claudette's today.

11:17.764 --> 11:19.896
Because I got to clear out
some of his stuff

11:19.940 --> 11:21.724
while she's away
at bartending training.

11:21.768 --> 11:24.335
Oh. LaDonna and I found

11:24.379 --> 11:26.511
a torn page amongst his things.

11:26.555 --> 11:28.775
I'm seeking the rest of it.

11:28.818 --> 11:30.472
I could help you
sort through everything.

11:30.515 --> 11:32.387
Yeah, of course.So...

11:32.430 --> 11:33.910
Claudette doesn't mind you

11:33.954 --> 11:35.738
going to her apartment
while she's away?

11:35.782 --> 11:38.262
Mind your business.

11:44.442 --> 11:46.314
[sighs]

11:53.887 --> 11:55.453
[sighs]

12:05.028 --> 12:06.029
MRS. GROVER:
Whew.

12:06.073 --> 12:08.075
She's finally down.

12:08.118 --> 12:09.816
[both laugh]Thanks, Mrs. G.

12:09.859 --> 12:12.470
You've been working
a lot of long hours lately.

12:12.514 --> 12:13.907
Yeah.

12:13.950 --> 12:15.865
You could afford help
around your house.

12:15.909 --> 12:18.215
But Mariah loves you.[smacks lips]

12:18.259 --> 12:20.565
She barely lets me
put her down anymore.

12:20.609 --> 12:23.743
Logan, I'm an old lady.
I got simple pleasures.

12:23.786 --> 12:27.442
I can't enjoy all of them
when I'm taking care of a baby.

12:27.485 --> 12:30.750
And, somehow, I got myself
into taking care of a man

12:30.793 --> 12:32.795
without any
of the benefits.

12:32.839 --> 12:34.797
[both laugh]

12:34.841 --> 12:36.930
Now, I love y'all,

12:36.973 --> 12:39.889
but I'm not a crutch
you can lean on forever.

12:39.933 --> 12:42.892
We can't go on
like this.

12:42.936 --> 12:45.765
And this bed
is pretty uncomfortable.

12:45.808 --> 12:47.201
[laughs]

12:47.244 --> 12:50.595
It's okay for you
to never forget Shanice,

12:50.639 --> 12:53.947
but you got to move on.[sighs]

12:53.990 --> 12:56.558
You should talk
to somebody.

12:56.601 --> 12:59.343
Ah, I don't know.

12:59.387 --> 13:01.476
Talking to somebody
about this feels...

13:01.519 --> 13:02.999
It makes it real?

13:04.000 --> 13:05.785
Baby, it is real.

13:05.828 --> 13:08.222
Even if she did
come back,

13:08.265 --> 13:10.398
you can't pick up
where you left off.

13:10.441 --> 13:12.008
So...

13:12.052 --> 13:15.142
you're getting up out of
this bed, so help me.

13:15.185 --> 13:16.839
[sighs]If not therapy,

13:16.883 --> 13:18.580
I'm signing you up
for FOMO-Mates.

13:18.623 --> 13:20.495
[both laugh]Oh, no.

13:20.538 --> 13:23.150
Okay. Point taken.

13:23.193 --> 13:24.934
Shanice was like
a daughter to me,

13:24.978 --> 13:27.284
but she's not here.

13:27.328 --> 13:28.851
She's not even in that
big old empty house

13:28.895 --> 13:31.506
that you won't
go home to.

13:31.549 --> 13:33.464
You've got to
accept the truth.

13:33.508 --> 13:35.989
Bury what you can,

13:36.032 --> 13:37.729
and live with the rest.

13:37.773 --> 13:39.819
[cell phone vibrates]

13:41.733 --> 13:42.822
[short chuckle]

13:47.000 --> 13:48.697
[truck beeps]

13:50.438 --> 13:51.831
KEISHA:
My sister was a lot

13:51.874 --> 13:54.137
of things to a lot of people.

13:54.181 --> 13:57.837
To me, she was everything.

13:57.880 --> 14:00.535
It's been five years

14:00.578 --> 14:02.406
since I...

14:02.450 --> 14:04.539
we lost her,

14:04.582 --> 14:08.238
but, uh...

14:08.282 --> 14:11.328
why can't I move on?

14:11.372 --> 14:14.157
Why am I still acting out and...

14:14.201 --> 14:17.508
God, making the worst decisions.

14:17.552 --> 14:19.510
Me and my
girlfriend, uh...

14:19.554 --> 14:21.164
Me...

14:21.208 --> 14:24.298
and my ex-girlfriend
just recently broke up,

14:24.341 --> 14:28.171
and, uh, not even
a second later I'm

14:28.215 --> 14:30.347
hooking up with a co-worker.

14:34.656 --> 14:37.572
Still trying to make it
all make sense.

14:41.271 --> 14:43.099
I'm still pretty new here,

14:43.143 --> 14:45.232
so, uh, thanks

14:45.275 --> 14:47.364
for, uh,

14:47.408 --> 14:48.626
letting me share.

14:51.238 --> 14:53.022
WOMAN:
Thank you for sharing.

14:53.066 --> 14:54.589
I know it's hard.

14:54.632 --> 14:57.200
MAN: Yeah, thank you.[overlapping chatter]

14:57.244 --> 14:59.072
I, uh...

14:59.115 --> 15:02.336
see a couple new faces, so, uh,

15:02.379 --> 15:04.033
guess I got to do
introductions, right?

15:04.077 --> 15:05.905
[chuckles] Um...

15:05.948 --> 15:07.036
Hi. I'm Logan.

15:07.080 --> 15:08.690
ALL:
Hi, Logan.

15:08.733 --> 15:11.388
Uh...

15:11.432 --> 15:14.348
I've been away a while 'cause
I thought I had it handled.

15:14.391 --> 15:17.177
WOMAN: Oh, yeah.LOGAN: Guess not. [chuckles]

15:17.220 --> 15:18.743
So, back in Grief Group.

15:18.787 --> 15:20.267
A while back,

15:20.310 --> 15:22.791
the love of my life,
this brilliant,

15:22.834 --> 15:24.880
hard-ass lawyer

15:24.924 --> 15:26.447
married me. [chuckles]

15:26.490 --> 15:28.579
You know,
we had a family

15:28.623 --> 15:30.494
and everything.

15:30.538 --> 15:33.280
It was-it was kind of perfect,
to be honest.

15:33.323 --> 15:35.412
Then she
up and vanished.

15:35.456 --> 15:37.675
I wa-I was frantic.

15:37.719 --> 15:40.765
I-I was worried something
terrible had happened to her.

15:41.984 --> 15:44.291
I just hoped that
I could find her,

15:44.334 --> 15:45.466
save her.

15:45.509 --> 15:47.598
Well...

15:47.642 --> 15:49.383
Then, uh,

15:49.426 --> 15:51.211
they found this letter.

15:51.254 --> 15:52.777
Police gave me this letter.

15:52.821 --> 15:55.911
You know, I-I don't know
what destroyed me more,

15:55.955 --> 15:59.001
The thought of losing her or...

15:59.045 --> 16:00.394
[sighs]

16:00.437 --> 16:03.440
...the idea that...

16:03.484 --> 16:05.660
maybe she was out of my life
because that's what she wanted.

16:05.703 --> 16:07.140
Even so,

16:07.183 --> 16:09.272
I looked for her for years.

16:11.448 --> 16:12.710
Then she came back.

16:14.495 --> 16:16.584
Not because she had
a change of heart or anything,

16:16.627 --> 16:18.194
she just literally came back.

16:18.238 --> 16:20.544
She fell out of the sky

16:20.588 --> 16:22.155
and landed on my doorstep.

16:22.198 --> 16:23.852
Wait. She's a 4,400?

16:23.895 --> 16:25.985
Look, I-I-I...

16:26.028 --> 16:27.682
This is
a grief group,

16:27.725 --> 16:29.075
not a 4,400
support group.

16:29.118 --> 16:31.468
You got what everybody here
prays for,

16:31.512 --> 16:33.035
and you want
our sympathy?

16:33.079 --> 16:35.516
That's what this
is about-- 4,400?

16:35.559 --> 16:37.474
Somebody's playing you, man.
The whole thing's a hoax.

16:37.518 --> 16:38.562
A hoax?A hoax.

16:38.606 --> 16:40.651
No. That is not what this is.

16:40.695 --> 16:42.566
It is real,There's no way that people
are falling out of the sky.

16:42.610 --> 16:44.394
and it is a gift from God.No, I don't think
you understand...

16:44.438 --> 16:45.743
How do you not have any hope?[overlapping arguments continue]

16:56.363 --> 16:58.408
[cell phone vibrates]

17:00.410 --> 17:01.672
Hello?SHANICE: Logan?

17:01.716 --> 17:02.891
You answered.

17:02.934 --> 17:04.719
Shanice. You've been calling?

17:04.762 --> 17:06.373
Right, right, yes.

17:06.416 --> 17:08.766
I wanted to invite you, um...

17:08.810 --> 17:11.639
to be a part of...

17:11.682 --> 17:13.336
this thing with me.

17:13.380 --> 17:16.339
Y-You mean this
Meet the 4,400 thing?

17:16.383 --> 17:18.254
Yeah, yeah.
It's-it's a way for the,

17:18.298 --> 17:20.430
for the world to kind of...

17:20.474 --> 17:21.823
you know, get to know us.

17:21.866 --> 17:23.346
It's not just you.

17:23.390 --> 17:26.219
Mariah, Hayden... Bridget.

17:26.262 --> 17:29.657
It would be all of us together,
kind of showing how we're

17:29.700 --> 17:32.529
one big, happy family.

17:32.573 --> 17:33.748
[clears throat]

17:33.791 --> 17:35.576
Is that what we are?

17:35.619 --> 17:38.144
[scoffs]

17:38.187 --> 17:39.928
What do you want with me?

17:39.971 --> 17:42.191
I'll think about the event.

17:43.366 --> 17:46.456
But...

17:46.500 --> 17:48.458
it's a lot right now, okay?

17:49.764 --> 17:52.462
Okay.

17:52.506 --> 17:53.985
Yeah. Fine.

17:55.770 --> 17:57.076
Is everything okay?
That sounded

17:57.119 --> 17:59.426
like an intense call.Yeah. It was

17:59.469 --> 18:01.123
just Shanice.

18:01.167 --> 18:04.387
She wants me to be a part
of this Meet the 4,400 event.

18:04.431 --> 18:06.259
Yeah, Jharrel
mentioned something

18:06.302 --> 18:08.522
about you all
appearing together, or...Yeah.

18:08.565 --> 18:11.829
It's not that
I don't want to help.

18:11.873 --> 18:14.049
I would love to tell the world

18:14.093 --> 18:16.791
how great it's been having
Hayden as a part of my family,

18:16.834 --> 18:18.749
but...Shanice.

18:18.793 --> 18:21.056
The man I heard
in group--

18:21.100 --> 18:23.102
the one struggling
with Shanice coming back--

18:23.145 --> 18:24.364
he spoke with love.

18:24.407 --> 18:26.540
That "against all odds"

18:26.583 --> 18:28.107
kind of love,
and the closest thing

18:28.150 --> 18:30.674
I have to that is my sister.

18:30.718 --> 18:32.328
I'm here because I have

18:32.372 --> 18:35.070
all of this love for her

18:35.114 --> 18:38.726
that I don't know
what to do with.

18:38.769 --> 18:40.815
And I'd give anything
to talk to her one last time.

18:43.861 --> 18:45.776
I'm sorry about your sister.

18:45.820 --> 18:47.952
Now, you heard them.

18:47.996 --> 18:49.345
You have been given
the second chance

18:49.389 --> 18:50.607
that so many people
in that group--

18:50.651 --> 18:52.479
myself included--
are jealous of.

18:52.522 --> 18:54.481
It's not that simple.

18:54.524 --> 18:56.831
Oh, in some ways, it is.

19:15.066 --> 19:17.634
JHARREL:
Well, I hope something
in here helps.

19:22.639 --> 19:26.077
[vocalizing]

19:27.470 --> 19:30.821
You, uh, certainly know your
way around Claudette's home.

19:30.865 --> 19:34.390
It's almost as if you spend
quite a bit of time here.

19:37.088 --> 19:38.742
What did I tell you
about minding your own business?

19:39.874 --> 19:41.571
Oh, yes,

19:41.615 --> 19:43.965
me and Claudette hooked up
a little while back,

19:44.008 --> 19:45.053
and we've just been

19:45.096 --> 19:47.490
I don't... enjoying the vibes,

19:47.534 --> 19:48.665
seeing where things go.

19:48.709 --> 19:52.147
Is that how dating works now?

19:52.191 --> 19:54.889
No declarations, just... vibes?

19:54.932 --> 19:58.153
Depends. [clears throat]

19:58.197 --> 20:00.373
Well, I'm asking because

20:00.416 --> 20:02.897
Shanice and I have been...

20:02.940 --> 20:05.334
enjoying vibes as well,

20:05.378 --> 20:07.206
but, yesterday
Logan stopped by,

20:07.249 --> 20:08.903
and...

20:08.946 --> 20:11.558
watching them together...

20:11.601 --> 20:14.256
How do I compete
with romantic history

20:14.300 --> 20:16.127
when I don't know
the first thing about

20:16.171 --> 20:17.564
21st century courtship?

20:17.607 --> 20:19.087
Listen.

20:19.130 --> 20:21.263
Given that I ruined

20:21.307 --> 20:23.831
my last relationship
with Carla because

20:23.874 --> 20:27.095
I was too obsessed with finding
my missing brother, Manny, I...

20:27.138 --> 20:29.228
don't really have
a lot of advice to give,

20:29.271 --> 20:30.577
but you...

20:30.620 --> 20:32.840
Okay, I mean,
you do know that Shanice

20:32.883 --> 20:34.755
is kind of a situation, right?

20:34.798 --> 20:37.061
I mean, you sure
you can handle that?

20:37.105 --> 20:39.281
Well, if I catch
your meaning,

20:39.325 --> 20:41.370
Claudette qualifies
in that category as well.

20:42.893 --> 20:44.373
Are you sure
you can handle her?

20:44.417 --> 20:46.114
Touché.

20:50.423 --> 20:52.163
Wait, is that it?

20:53.817 --> 20:56.516
Okay, so what is that?It's the rest of the COBOL code.

20:56.559 --> 20:58.605
You think it has something to do
with what happened to you all?

20:58.648 --> 21:02.173
I'll admit, we are working
on conjecture,

21:02.217 --> 21:04.828
but the way your brother
disappeared like us--

21:04.872 --> 21:06.265
you thought you saw
a green light.

21:06.308 --> 21:08.354
Yeah, but I don't know.

21:08.397 --> 21:10.530
That's why this might be
a fruitless search, but

21:10.573 --> 21:13.533
we desperately need answers,
anything that can help us

21:13.576 --> 21:15.535
get out from
the government's clutches.

21:15.578 --> 21:17.798
Yeah, I hear you on that.

21:17.841 --> 21:19.495
[sighs]

21:19.539 --> 21:21.410
But if Manny is somehow
related to all of this, I...

21:21.454 --> 21:24.935
I hope we can find answers that
will bring us all some peace.

21:24.979 --> 21:27.851
[sighs]

21:35.163 --> 21:37.383
Did Logan ever tell you
if he's coming?

21:37.426 --> 21:38.384
Nope.

21:38.427 --> 21:40.473
Carla's busy
figuring out

21:40.516 --> 21:42.692
some other family
for the segment.

21:43.998 --> 21:47.262
If he's upset about...About us?

21:47.306 --> 21:48.524
Do you think he might be?

21:50.134 --> 21:51.266
I-I don't know.

21:51.310 --> 21:54.487
After all this is through,

21:54.530 --> 21:57.185
I request your presence
in the cocktail lounge,

21:57.228 --> 21:58.795
to celebrate your successes.

21:58.839 --> 22:01.798
Andre, that's not necessary.Oh, it is.

22:01.842 --> 22:03.713
I'm handling my situation.

22:04.714 --> 22:06.107
I know how hard you've worked

22:06.150 --> 22:07.630
to make sure this event
helps us all,

22:07.674 --> 22:10.372
even those of us who signed
a terrible contract.

22:10.416 --> 22:12.896
[chuckles]It is appreciated.

22:16.160 --> 22:20.426
That man... was at Ypsi Med.

22:20.469 --> 22:24.908
I remember he had flames
dancing up his arms.

22:26.519 --> 22:29.130
Does that mean
they're releasing patients?

22:29.173 --> 22:31.045
Do you think Noah
could be next?

22:31.088 --> 22:34.918
You said that man's power
is fire?

22:34.962 --> 22:37.834
LaDonna assured me all
our powers are "fire."

22:37.878 --> 22:39.967
[both chuckle]

22:40.010 --> 22:43.362
But in all seriousness,
what are you thinking?

22:46.016 --> 22:48.628
I don't know,
it could be nothing.

22:48.671 --> 22:51.935
I'll find you later.
Promise.

23:00.553 --> 23:03.120
Just got out of
a security briefing.

23:03.164 --> 23:05.340
First thing they do is
shove a tranq in our hands.

23:05.384 --> 23:07.211
Why would they up security
for interviews?

23:07.255 --> 23:09.649
And more importantly, who are
those even supposed to protect?

23:09.692 --> 23:11.825
Jharrel...
Oh, Shanice.

23:11.868 --> 23:15.350
I think Bill Greene
is up to something.

23:15.394 --> 23:17.265
He brought in a 4,400
from Ypsi Med

23:17.308 --> 23:19.876
whose power is apparently
shooting flames from his arms.

23:19.920 --> 23:21.704
Okay, wait, the 4,400 he added

23:21.748 --> 23:23.532
to the interview list
last second?

23:23.576 --> 23:25.447
And it sure looked like the
Reverend was in on it with him.

23:25.491 --> 23:28.145
I knew I couldn't trust him.

23:28.189 --> 23:29.669
He'd be fine
revealing the powers.

23:29.712 --> 23:32.062
He practically did it with
Ji-Eun at his last event.

23:32.106 --> 23:33.934
I think he wants it out
in the world.

23:33.977 --> 23:35.588
Wait a minute, you think
that's what the government's

23:35.631 --> 23:38.112
trying to do here;
expose y'all's powers?

23:38.155 --> 23:39.722
But why would they do that?

23:41.855 --> 23:43.813
Because our powers could be
exactly what they need

23:43.857 --> 23:45.380
to trigger the conservatorships.

23:45.424 --> 23:47.077
All of a sudden,
the world thinks

23:47.121 --> 23:48.731
we need to be looked after.

23:48.775 --> 23:50.951
That we need
to be taken care of.

23:50.994 --> 23:52.822
We can't let that happen.

24:03.311 --> 24:06.096
Why is that man here
from Ypsi Med?

24:06.140 --> 24:07.968
Are you and the government
trying to

24:08.011 --> 24:09.535
reveal our powers to the world?

24:09.578 --> 24:12.102
You could be putting us all
in danger.

24:14.844 --> 24:16.803
You only see me as a threat,
don't you?

24:16.846 --> 24:19.588
Did it ever occur to you
that I'm trying to do right

24:19.632 --> 24:20.850
by our people?

24:23.984 --> 24:25.289
You aren't the only one
who knows how to

24:25.333 --> 24:26.682
make a difference, Shanice.

Hey, man, did they
give you any orders?

24:49.662 --> 24:52.055
I show them what I can do.

24:54.493 --> 24:57.713
Brûler...

24:59.672 --> 25:01.282
Then they set me free.

25:01.325 --> 25:03.632
Anything is better than

25:03.676 --> 25:06.200
going back to where
they kept me.
Okay.

25:06.243 --> 25:08.202
Shanice was right.
We got to make sure

25:08.245 --> 25:09.551
they don't have any other
tricks up their sleeve...

25:09.595 --> 25:12.423
Is it smart,
leaving him here?

25:15.252 --> 25:16.863
Look, we're trying
to protect you.

25:16.906 --> 25:18.168
Get everybody out

25:18.212 --> 25:19.256
from underneath
the government's thumb.

25:19.300 --> 25:22.521
Ca... Can you trust us?

25:28.222 --> 25:30.485
I want us all to be free.

Hello to everyone at home.
This is Gladys Keller.

25:44.543 --> 25:47.546
Today, we're bringing you
an in-depth special

25:47.589 --> 25:49.635
on the mysterious 4,400.

25:49.678 --> 25:54.553
Are they just like us, victims
of some terrible circumstance,

25:54.596 --> 25:56.424
or is there more to the story?

25:56.467 --> 25:58.426
We're pulling back the curtain,

25:58.469 --> 26:00.820
and hearing from them
in their own words,

26:00.863 --> 26:02.648
live and unedited.

26:02.691 --> 26:04.258
Our first guest,

26:04.301 --> 26:07.391
the prestigious
Reverend Isaiah Johnston,

26:07.435 --> 26:10.438
declared deceased in 1993,

26:10.481 --> 26:12.179
brings us to the heart of it.

26:12.222 --> 26:14.616
Thank you for that introduction.

26:14.660 --> 26:16.226
As for your question,

26:16.270 --> 26:17.967
I don't think there is
a difference between

26:18.011 --> 26:20.056
the 4,400 and everyone else.

26:20.100 --> 26:23.233
See, the Lord works
in mysterious ways.

26:23.277 --> 26:25.235
We don't know why
we were brought here,

26:25.279 --> 26:27.934
but we're all human, Gladys.

26:27.977 --> 26:32.373
I'm curious, and I'm sure
the folks at home are, too.

26:32.416 --> 26:34.157
Why are you all
under the protection

26:34.201 --> 26:35.506
of the U.S. government?

26:42.688 --> 26:45.081
The government is simply
doing right

26:45.125 --> 26:47.083
by a vulnerable population.

26:47.127 --> 26:49.869
Something I think we'd all
want them to do more of.

26:49.912 --> 26:51.348
wouldn't you, Gladys?

Shanice is right this way.

26:58.312 --> 27:01.968
I'm so glad you all
could make it.

27:02.011 --> 27:03.883
Hey, Shanice.Hi.

27:05.275 --> 27:07.626
I know it'll be
a little strange for us all

27:07.669 --> 27:11.630
to share the stage together
and act like...

27:11.673 --> 27:14.937
well, um...

27:14.981 --> 27:17.853
And it's probably the last thing
you want to do,

27:17.897 --> 27:19.942
especially with
your vacation coming up.

27:22.466 --> 27:24.947
Are you excited?

Uh, yeah, yeah.

27:28.168 --> 27:29.952
Uh, Mom...Yes?

27:33.521 --> 27:36.350
Um, I think they want us to

27:36.393 --> 27:39.005
get mics put on or something.

27:39.048 --> 27:40.310
Come on.

27:40.354 --> 27:42.312
We'll see you out there.All right.

27:42.356 --> 27:44.706
Okay. Come on.

27:51.713 --> 27:55.064
Can we talk somewhere,
in private, maybe?

28:08.295 --> 28:09.731
Is everything okay?

28:09.775 --> 28:12.560
Are you upset about
seeing me with Andre?

[scoffs] I don't know what
the rules are here.I know.

28:16.259 --> 28:18.000
You're married
to someone else now,

28:18.044 --> 28:21.264
and I just thought you didn't
want anything to do with me.

28:22.788 --> 28:24.485
Am I being unfaithful?

28:24.528 --> 28:26.443
No. You're not.

28:30.099 --> 28:31.448
I am.

28:35.801 --> 28:39.369
Look, right or wrong, I was
upset seeing you with Andre.

28:40.588 --> 28:42.198
It's hard not to have
these feelings

28:42.242 --> 28:44.070
when you're the first woman
I ever fell in love with.

28:45.811 --> 28:49.684
And when you left,
it-it broke me.

28:49.728 --> 28:51.947
I still don't know how
I picked up the pieces.

28:53.079 --> 28:54.341
That's not true.

28:54.384 --> 28:57.126
'Cause a part of me never did.

for all that it's worth

29:04.351 --> 29:05.744
that you'd come back one day.

29:09.095 --> 29:12.141
Are you saying you want
to give us a second chance?

29:16.798 --> 29:17.973
I'm sorry.

29:23.457 --> 29:25.633
It's taken me till now
to realize we...

29:25.676 --> 29:27.287
we can't go back.

There's no erasing
the last 16 years.

29:31.508 --> 29:34.076
When you came back,
we got our second chance,

29:34.120 --> 29:36.557
but it was a second
chance at closure.

29:36.600 --> 29:38.037
I don't understand.

29:38.080 --> 29:40.996
No, no, I know that
I was supposed to come onstage

our happy, blended,

anymore, Shanice.

a clean break and move on.

to my family, to Hayden.

give up on me.I'm sorry,

she doesn't want to be found.
