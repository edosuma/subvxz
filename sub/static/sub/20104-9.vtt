WEBVTT

00:02.270 --> 00:04.372
Previously on Prison Break...
LINCOLN: We found Michael.

00:04.405 --> 00:06.374
Never thought I'd see
this face again.

00:06.407 --> 00:07.975
You weren't supposed to.

00:08.007 --> 00:09.977
I own you, Scofield.
If you're planning something,

00:10.010 --> 00:12.380
I'll always be a step
ahead of you.

00:12.413 --> 00:13.747
MICHAEL:
Your husband.

00:13.781 --> 00:15.183
Jacob is Poseidon.

00:15.216 --> 00:16.184
He's a CIA operative,

00:16.216 --> 00:18.352
deep cover.

00:18.386 --> 00:20.221
He runs a splinter cell
called 21-Void.

00:20.254 --> 00:22.423
He targeted me
for my skills.

00:22.456 --> 00:25.659
Four years ago, he betrayed me
so he could have you.

00:25.693 --> 00:26.894
How did he betray you?

00:26.927 --> 00:28.028
MICHAEL:
We were meeting a man

00:28.062 --> 00:29.097
named Harlan Gaines,

00:29.130 --> 00:30.398
a deputy director of the CIA.

00:30.431 --> 00:32.665
Poseidon shot and killed Gaines
that night.

00:32.700 --> 00:34.735
I knew I was being set up.

00:34.768 --> 00:36.937
Michael,
he's with our son right now.

00:36.970 --> 00:39.507
Scofield was looking
for a partner, combing prisons,

00:39.540 --> 00:41.842
looking for someone
who could handle himself.

00:41.875 --> 00:43.511
What are you trying to tell me?

00:43.544 --> 00:46.880
It was ingrained in you, son.
You got it from me.

00:46.914 --> 00:49.049
Screen grab of the Skype
transmission he sent
from the desert.

00:49.083 --> 00:50.418
Of all things to encrypt,
why that?

00:50.451 --> 00:52.786
I'm done with 21-Void
after this.

00:52.820 --> 00:54.622
There's no leaving 21-Void, Van.

00:54.655 --> 00:57.258
How about you just shut up
and pay me, Burrows?

00:57.291 --> 00:58.292
I don't have it.

01:01.229 --> 01:03.063
You know who I am?

01:03.097 --> 01:04.897
I'm gonna get you
and your mother out of here.

01:04.932 --> 01:07.501
We need to run.

01:09.903 --> 01:11.905
(gunshot)

01:33.994 --> 01:36.264
Do you know
that you're a psychopath?

01:36.297 --> 01:39.233
I assure you, I'm not the first
CIA man to hide his life

01:39.267 --> 01:40.634
from his family.

01:40.668 --> 01:42.170
You hid it from the CIA.

01:42.203 --> 01:43.971
Look, you want to screw
something up?

01:44.004 --> 01:46.240
Put a thousand people on it.
You want to get it done right?

01:46.274 --> 01:48.142
Put it in the hands of a few.
What we were doing

01:48.176 --> 01:49.510
was advancing
this country's cause.

01:49.543 --> 01:51.078
How does freeing a man
like Abu Ramal

01:51.111 --> 01:53.013
advance this country's cause?

01:53.046 --> 01:56.517
Well, it doesn't.

01:56.550 --> 01:59.086
The missions before,

01:59.119 --> 02:01.922
they were for the good
of the country, but...

02:01.955 --> 02:05.459
No, this one
wasn't about country.

02:05.493 --> 02:07.761
It was about you.

02:07.795 --> 02:11.432
Nobody wants to die
to their old life, Sara.

02:11.465 --> 02:13.701
And Michael didn't.

02:15.569 --> 02:19.940
He wanted to hold on to it
so desperately.

02:19.973 --> 02:21.675
In that moment, I wanted him

02:21.709 --> 02:22.676
to go away,

02:22.710 --> 02:25.346
the whole agreement,

02:25.379 --> 02:26.447
and just have you.

02:26.480 --> 02:28.382
You sent him to Yemen to die.

02:30.050 --> 02:32.286
Kept telling myself
this was gonna be my last lie.

02:32.320 --> 02:37.124
That it would fade with time
as we had anniversaries,

02:37.157 --> 02:38.992
raised that beautiful child.

02:39.026 --> 02:40.694
That is not your child.

02:40.728 --> 02:42.230
I raised him.

02:42.263 --> 02:43.397
That love is real.

02:43.431 --> 02:44.565
It's not a lie.

02:44.598 --> 02:46.800
You are using him as bait.

02:46.834 --> 02:48.402
You son of a bitch.

02:48.436 --> 02:50.037
She knows not to hurt him.

02:50.070 --> 02:51.071
You were so obsessed
with Michael

02:51.104 --> 02:52.206
that you would risk my son!

02:52.240 --> 02:54.342
Michael? You mean you.

02:54.375 --> 02:57.345
You don't love me.
Your ego's too big.

02:57.378 --> 02:59.580
You're too busy trying to be
the smartest man in the room.

02:59.613 --> 03:01.915
And then you met my husband,

03:01.949 --> 03:03.351
and you realized

03:03.384 --> 03:04.685
he's smarter than you.

03:04.718 --> 03:05.886
(laughs)

03:05.919 --> 03:07.388
I don't think so.

03:07.421 --> 03:08.489
You sure?

03:08.522 --> 03:11.158
I'm positive.

03:11.191 --> 03:13.193
Our love was real, Sara.

03:13.227 --> 03:14.695
Past tense.

03:14.728 --> 03:17.565
I still love you.

03:20.568 --> 03:21.735
Everything's set, boss.

03:21.769 --> 03:23.070
Good.

03:28.208 --> 03:29.777
Got to give
you credit.

03:29.810 --> 03:31.845
You'll go the whole nine yards
to help one man

03:31.879 --> 03:33.113
steal another man's wife.

03:33.146 --> 03:34.415
No, no, no.
Don't talk to him.

03:34.448 --> 03:36.183
Or what?
He'll do something

03:36.216 --> 03:38.252
you're not already gonna do?
You're going to kill me.

03:38.286 --> 03:40.288
No matter how many times you
tell me you love me first.

03:40.321 --> 03:41.955
Shut up!

03:41.989 --> 03:43.724
Michael didn't kill
Harlan Gaines. He had no motive.

03:43.757 --> 03:45.459
Shut up.
He's the one with the motive.

03:45.493 --> 03:47.295
Harlan Gaines was
your CIA director

03:47.328 --> 03:48.929
and he was looking
into Jacob.

03:48.962 --> 03:50.931
He was gonna
put him prison.

03:54.468 --> 03:56.136
Damn it!

03:59.106 --> 04:01.074
Tape her mouth shut, please.

04:01.108 --> 04:02.576
Tape it shut.

04:02.610 --> 04:03.877
(tape unrolling)

04:03.911 --> 04:05.913
If you do, an innocent man dies,

04:05.946 --> 04:08.982
and the real killer walks.

04:09.016 --> 04:10.884
Don't you understand?

04:10.918 --> 04:12.920
Jacob killed
Harlan Gaines.

04:12.953 --> 04:15.356
Just shut it.

04:19.159 --> 04:20.793
Is there a problem?

04:23.864 --> 04:26.434
JACOB: Here he comes.
It's time to do this.

04:30.270 --> 04:33.073
This place is gonna burn down
in ten minutes.

04:33.106 --> 04:36.744
There will be two bodies in it.

04:36.777 --> 04:39.079
And if it's
any solace,

04:39.112 --> 04:41.649
our son won't be one of them.

04:45.353 --> 04:46.554
(grunts)

04:55.563 --> 04:58.332
(door opens, closes)

05:12.312 --> 05:16.149
While the cat's away,
the mice will play.

05:21.355 --> 05:22.756
Something's wrong.

05:24.692 --> 05:26.760
(sniffling)

05:40.340 --> 05:42.075
I got your map.

05:42.109 --> 05:44.177
I'm gonna get you
and your mother out of here.

05:44.211 --> 05:46.447
I didn't draw a map.

05:53.353 --> 05:54.388
We need to run.

05:57.558 --> 05:59.326
VAN GOGH:
Wait.

05:59.359 --> 06:01.061
What are you doing up here, Van?

06:01.094 --> 06:04.197
I just want to make sure that
we're getting the right guy.

06:04.231 --> 06:05.766
Ask him
some questions.

06:05.799 --> 06:08.702
(grunting)

06:08.736 --> 06:10.337
Let my son go.

06:10.370 --> 06:12.506
Do whatever you want with me.

06:12.540 --> 06:13.974
Just let my son go.

06:17.811 --> 06:20.514
Orders weren't to ask questions.

06:20.548 --> 06:21.882
It was to shoot on sight.

06:22.616 --> 06:24.618
(grunts)

06:26.420 --> 06:28.789
VAN GOGH:
Maybe we should
ask questions, damn it.

06:28.822 --> 06:30.924
If Scofield killed
Harlan Gaines,

06:30.958 --> 06:32.926
we take him to the police,
if we have to.

06:32.960 --> 06:35.062
We get this done
the right way.

06:35.095 --> 06:36.630
Poseidon would
never let us live.

06:36.664 --> 06:37.998
He won't find us.

06:41.401 --> 06:43.737
I told you. We want
to disappear, we disappear.

06:43.771 --> 06:45.739
I can make
that happen.

06:45.773 --> 06:47.541
We turn him in,

06:47.575 --> 06:48.776
and we're gone.

06:48.809 --> 06:50.578
Don't make me choose like this.

06:50.611 --> 06:51.779
Emily.

06:51.812 --> 06:53.647
Is it really even a choice?

06:53.681 --> 06:55.348
No.

06:58.251 --> 07:00.754
'Cause there's no leaving
21-Void.

07:08.962 --> 07:10.464
Go.

07:10.498 --> 07:11.732
Your uncle's
at the end of the driveway.

07:11.765 --> 07:13.634
Don't turn around.
Run! Go!

07:13.667 --> 07:15.168
(gunshots)

07:18.972 --> 07:20.140
(grunts)

07:20.173 --> 07:21.809
Sara.

07:21.842 --> 07:23.176
SARA:
Where's our boy?

07:24.812 --> 07:26.346
Uncle Lincoln, Uncle Lincoln!

07:26.379 --> 07:29.416
No, no, no, it's me.
What's going on?

07:29.449 --> 07:31.418
They're shooting.
I'm scared.

07:31.451 --> 07:33.453
Okay. They've come for you.
Who?

07:33.487 --> 07:34.588
I am not gonna
let them hurt you,

07:34.622 --> 07:36.256
you understand?
Get in the car.

07:36.289 --> 07:37.858
No, we've got to go now, Mike.
We've got to go.

07:37.891 --> 07:38.992
What about my mom?

07:39.026 --> 07:40.027
Go, go, go.

07:40.060 --> 07:41.428
(tires screeching)

07:41.461 --> 07:43.096
Mike!

07:43.130 --> 07:45.298
Mike! No!

07:45.332 --> 07:47.300
No!

07:47.334 --> 07:48.301
No!

07:48.335 --> 07:49.436
Mike!

07:49.469 --> 07:50.437
He took him.

07:50.470 --> 07:52.039
Sara...
He took our son.

07:52.072 --> 07:54.141
Come back to me. Come
back to me, sweetheart.

07:54.174 --> 07:55.442
Come back to me.

07:55.475 --> 07:56.810
We got to stay
focused, all right?

07:56.844 --> 07:58.879
This is not over.
Not by a long shot.

07:58.912 --> 08:00.213
Where's Linc?
What?

08:00.247 --> 08:01.348
We got to find Linc, okay?

08:01.381 --> 08:02.583
We're gonna find Linc.

08:06.353 --> 08:08.388
Linc.

08:08.421 --> 08:10.257
SARA:
Oh my God.

08:11.324 --> 08:13.426
Linc. Linc.

08:15.696 --> 08:17.698
*

08:49.897 --> 08:51.498
I let you down, Michael.

08:51.531 --> 08:53.901
I should have taken care of Luca
when I had the chance.

08:53.934 --> 08:56.870
You didn't let me down.
You couldn't have known.

08:56.904 --> 08:59.439
We're so close
because of you, Linc.

08:59.472 --> 09:00.908
You got me home.

09:00.941 --> 09:02.242
You got me home.

09:03.543 --> 09:04.878
They've stabilized him,
Michael.

09:04.912 --> 09:06.379
There's nothing we can do.

09:06.413 --> 09:08.415
We've got to get you
out of here right now.

09:22.429 --> 09:25.098
(clears throat)

09:25.132 --> 09:27.701
Okay, you got to give me
some direction here, you know?

09:27.735 --> 09:29.402
Some, um...

09:29.436 --> 09:31.972
fatherly advice

09:32.005 --> 09:38.746
on how to deal with having
a father that's, um...

09:38.779 --> 09:39.980
you.

09:43.450 --> 09:46.754
Well, you know, uh...

09:50.357 --> 09:53.260
Is this blood freaking you out
like it's freaking me out?

09:53.293 --> 09:54.828
Yeah, yeah. Let me, uh...

09:54.862 --> 09:59.166
Scofield said that it would
deliver me. Both of us.

09:59.199 --> 10:01.334
All I have to do

10:01.368 --> 10:03.170
is just get it to him

10:03.203 --> 10:05.773
to understand why.

10:08.208 --> 10:09.943
So I can finally
understand this.

10:09.977 --> 10:11.178
(sniffs)

10:13.380 --> 10:15.248
He give you this?

10:15.282 --> 10:17.751
"By your hand, you shall know

10:17.785 --> 10:19.186
the glories of your progeny..."

10:19.219 --> 10:20.654
I-It's, it's...

10:20.688 --> 10:23.190
It's "progeny," dear boy.

10:24.391 --> 10:26.794
"Progeny.

10:26.827 --> 10:29.196
And our world
will be made right forevermore."

10:29.229 --> 10:30.330
Originally, I thought it
was a religious thing.

10:30.363 --> 10:32.599
You know, son of God,
and all that.

10:32.632 --> 10:34.434
But now I know it's...

10:34.467 --> 10:38.105
it's my own progeny.

10:38.138 --> 10:39.172
(laughs)

10:39.206 --> 10:40.407
You.

10:42.509 --> 10:44.044
(chuckles)

10:47.147 --> 10:50.317
It's a glorious thing indeed.

10:50.350 --> 10:53.520
Even if I don't have
a damn clue how to deal with it.

10:55.588 --> 10:57.991
You and me both.

11:03.263 --> 11:04.664
MICHAEL:
I've got a way to get

11:04.698 --> 11:06.399
our son back, Sara.

11:06.433 --> 11:08.301
I've been planning
to bring Jacob down

11:08.335 --> 11:13.140
ever since he forced me to
turn my back on you and Mike.

11:13.173 --> 11:14.474
A plan I had to put on hold

11:14.507 --> 11:16.910
while I was in that
Yemeni prison.

11:16.944 --> 11:20.047
I had to wait
till I got out.

11:23.083 --> 11:24.584
Till everything aligned.

11:24.617 --> 11:26.353
(car approaching)

11:28.255 --> 11:30.690
Till now.

11:44.872 --> 11:46.539
Tell me you got something.

11:46.573 --> 11:49.242
It's eluding me.

11:49.276 --> 11:53.346
NELSON: There's an even bigger
code encrypted into the eyes.

11:53.380 --> 11:54.915
JACOB:
And what's it say?

11:54.948 --> 11:56.884
NELSON:
I don't know yet.

11:56.917 --> 11:58.919
But with the amount of
processing power I throw at it,

11:58.952 --> 12:01.654
we're gonna find out
real soon.

12:14.667 --> 12:16.169
What's wrong?

12:18.305 --> 12:20.974
I-I don't know how to say it,
so, um...

12:21.008 --> 12:23.210
That man was
a police detective,

12:23.243 --> 12:25.979
and he told me your moth...

12:26.013 --> 12:27.514
your mother's dead.

12:28.782 --> 12:30.083
What?

12:30.117 --> 12:31.985
I know.
I know.

12:32.019 --> 12:34.387
But I'm gonna take you
somewhere safe,

12:34.421 --> 12:36.589
where those people
that are trying to hurt you

12:36.623 --> 12:38.158
can't reach you.

12:38.191 --> 12:39.392
Why would they try
and hurt me?

12:39.426 --> 12:41.394
It's because I love you.

12:41.428 --> 12:42.796
And they're trying to hurt me--

12:42.830 --> 12:45.232
take the one thing
I truly love away.

12:45.265 --> 12:47.600
Why would they try
and hurt you?

12:52.305 --> 12:53.673
Because there are some things

12:53.706 --> 12:55.708
I haven't told you
about me.

12:58.378 --> 13:00.447
I sent that letter
to you for a reason.

13:00.480 --> 13:02.482
Poseidon was monitoring
my communications

13:02.515 --> 13:04.918
with everyone who could
possibly be a resource

13:04.952 --> 13:06.186
or an ally, but not with people

13:06.219 --> 13:09.422
I despised.

13:09.456 --> 13:12.225
Give it to me straight--
how you really feel about me?

13:14.361 --> 13:15.695
I figured if I showed grace
to a man

13:15.728 --> 13:17.097
who'd never seen it before
in his life,

13:17.130 --> 13:18.098
maybe he'd be grateful,

13:18.131 --> 13:19.799
do something for us.

13:19.833 --> 13:22.202
All of us,

13:22.235 --> 13:23.837
himself included.

13:23.871 --> 13:27.941
"And our lives shall be
made right forevermore."

13:27.975 --> 13:29.776
I'm talking about normal,
everyday life.

13:29.809 --> 13:32.345
The kind of freedom
none of us has known

13:32.379 --> 13:34.047
in a long, long time.

13:34.081 --> 13:35.983
But Poseidon's not just
gonna let us go.

13:36.016 --> 13:38.886
He's got me and your son

13:38.919 --> 13:40.153
in an iron grip.

13:40.187 --> 13:43.056
Someone has to make him
let go.

13:43.090 --> 13:45.525
Do you understand?

13:45.558 --> 13:47.527
I'm tracking where you're going.

13:47.560 --> 13:49.897
(chuckles)

13:49.930 --> 13:51.865
Only way we're gonna get

13:51.899 --> 13:53.800
that beautiful,
mundane life

13:53.833 --> 13:56.136
you're talking--
any of us--

13:56.169 --> 13:58.538
is if I take his.

14:03.911 --> 14:05.845
(chuckles)

14:12.920 --> 14:15.422
We'll be safe here for now.

14:15.455 --> 14:17.590
Hey, listen,

14:17.624 --> 14:19.759
I promised I'd explain.

14:19.792 --> 14:21.594
The reason those
people are after me...

14:21.628 --> 14:23.730
I know this is gonna
be hard to believe,

14:23.763 --> 14:27.867
but I'm basically
a secret agent.

14:35.808 --> 14:37.544
(door unlocks)

14:40.948 --> 14:42.549
Come on in.

14:44.551 --> 14:48.188
You know that fort you've got
in the backyard?

14:48.221 --> 14:51.424
It feels good to go
somewhere like that, right?

14:51.458 --> 14:56.096
A place no one knows about,
where no one can get to you.

14:56.129 --> 14:58.966
Well, that's what
this place is for me.

14:58.999 --> 15:00.167
(door unlocks)

15:01.734 --> 15:03.536
JACOB:
It's okay.

15:03.570 --> 15:04.771
It's okay.

15:04.804 --> 15:05.805
Would you please show him

15:05.838 --> 15:07.074
your credentials, Agent Blake?

15:07.107 --> 15:10.643
Agent Emily Blake, CIA.

15:10.677 --> 15:11.878
I'm sorry that had to happen

15:11.911 --> 15:13.947
in front of you
at the house.

15:13.981 --> 15:16.749
She was stationed at the
house to protect you...

15:16.783 --> 15:19.152
from exactly the man
who ended up coming,

15:19.186 --> 15:20.287
the man who said

15:20.320 --> 15:21.888
he was your dad.

15:21.921 --> 15:23.656
Really?

15:34.934 --> 15:37.937
I've made enemies defending
America over the years.

15:37.971 --> 15:39.506
Worst part is that this

15:39.539 --> 15:42.142
particular one dredged up
the memory of your father.

15:44.144 --> 15:46.113
The truth is, Mikey,

15:46.146 --> 15:49.316
despite what you may want
to believe, your father died

15:49.349 --> 15:50.984
seven years ago.

15:51.018 --> 15:54.421
(cell phone rings)

15:54.454 --> 15:56.089
Yeah.

15:56.123 --> 15:58.291
This is Michael Scofield.

16:01.794 --> 16:03.930
We were just
talking about you.

16:03.963 --> 16:06.599
I'm giving you one last chance
to save your life.

16:06.633 --> 16:09.369
Hand the boy over
or I can't be held responsible

16:09.402 --> 16:10.470
for what happens next.

16:10.503 --> 16:11.638
Are you threatening my life?

16:11.671 --> 16:13.973
Only if you don't
hand him over.

16:14.007 --> 16:16.543
I'd never hand over my son.

16:16.576 --> 16:17.844
He's not your son

16:17.877 --> 16:19.312
and never was.

16:19.346 --> 16:21.281
Stay away from my dad,

16:21.314 --> 16:22.882
you hear?

16:22.915 --> 16:24.951
Stay away!

16:24.984 --> 16:26.219
(cell phone beeps)

16:28.188 --> 16:30.023
Good boy.

16:38.765 --> 16:40.400
He called him Dad.

16:40.433 --> 16:42.135
Jacob.

16:42.169 --> 16:44.904
No, he's-he's brainwashing him,
that's all.

16:44.937 --> 16:47.574
T-BAG:
Man like that, you're right.

16:49.209 --> 16:52.412
He deserves to die.

16:52.445 --> 16:54.881
Where is he?

16:54.914 --> 16:56.683
Where is Poseidon?

16:56.716 --> 16:57.917
He'll be dealt with.

16:57.950 --> 16:59.886
Wait, hang on, hang on,
hang on, man.

16:59.919 --> 17:01.354
If you get caught--

17:01.388 --> 17:03.990
if he gets caught,
he's going back to the pen.

17:04.022 --> 17:05.224
T-BAG:
Come on, come on.
I'm not...

17:05.258 --> 17:06.659
And if I don't do it?

17:06.693 --> 17:08.595
Criminy, I want you
free and clear,

17:08.627 --> 17:09.996
and if that's the
only way to do it,

17:10.029 --> 17:11.064
then I got to be
the one that does it.

17:11.098 --> 17:12.332
Scofield ain't gonna do it.

17:12.365 --> 17:13.532
He don't got
the killing gene.

17:13.566 --> 17:14.901
No one is getting caught.

17:14.934 --> 17:16.303
There's a very specific
order to this.

17:18.805 --> 17:21.674
MICHAEL:
Sara, I want you to make sure

17:21.708 --> 17:24.743
Linc's safe
and out of harm's way.

17:24.777 --> 17:27.579
Whip, T-Bag, you're gonna
collect a wild card for us.

17:27.614 --> 17:30.417
One that Jacob
doesn't know is out there.

17:30.450 --> 17:33.720
I'm gonna go to the nest,
where this all started,

17:33.753 --> 17:36.623
where the secrets lay hidden,

17:36.656 --> 17:39.892
and where blood will finally be
spilled in its rightful place.

17:43.663 --> 17:45.365
JACOB: The call I just got
from Scofield--

17:45.398 --> 17:46.899
I want to know
where it came from.

17:46.933 --> 17:48.468
Location data

17:48.501 --> 17:51.037
coming to you right now.

17:51.070 --> 17:52.905
Middle of nowhere.

17:52.939 --> 17:56.042
Started moving northeast
and the phone was shut off.

17:56.075 --> 17:58.077
Maybe tossed.

18:03.816 --> 18:05.051
(exhales)

18:05.084 --> 18:07.053
You and your damn zoo, Scofield.

18:07.086 --> 18:09.055
I'm gonna find out
once and for all

18:09.088 --> 18:10.790
what you were really
doing there.

18:10.823 --> 18:13.226
What you were really planning.

18:13.260 --> 18:15.094
And then I'm gonna kill you.

18:26.105 --> 18:28.275
I know everything about you.

18:28.308 --> 18:30.477
Even your most mundane actions.

18:30.510 --> 18:33.813
Like the zoo.
What's with you and the zoo?

18:50.197 --> 18:51.664
I had to know everything
about the man

18:51.698 --> 18:53.766
who wore his plans
on his skin.

18:53.800 --> 18:55.101
In plain sight, yet

18:55.134 --> 18:57.170
so mysterious.

19:08.047 --> 19:10.483
(bird squawks)

19:23.496 --> 19:26.132
The secret to real power

19:26.165 --> 19:28.301
is to never betray
your intentions.

19:28.335 --> 19:30.703
To wear nothing
on your sleeve,

19:30.737 --> 19:33.773
and to never let anyone
see your face.

19:38.578 --> 19:42.382
I'll always
be a step ahead of you.

19:42.415 --> 19:44.517
I can see everything
in your eyes.

19:44.551 --> 19:45.918
(phone rings)

19:48.888 --> 19:50.557
JACOB:
What?

19:50.590 --> 19:52.225
I decrypted the code
from the eyes.

19:52.259 --> 19:54.160
It's a quote

19:54.193 --> 19:55.161
from Napoleon.

19:55.194 --> 19:56.596
What quote?

19:56.629 --> 19:58.197
"Never interrupt your enemy

19:58.231 --> 20:00.267
when he's making a mistake."

20:10.310 --> 20:13.212
It's what's behind
the eyes that counts.

20:33.766 --> 20:36.369
(phone ringing)

20:36.403 --> 20:37.737
Yeah.

20:37.770 --> 20:38.938
Thought you should know
I'm looking at

20:38.971 --> 20:41.207
your closed servers right now.

20:41.240 --> 20:43.576
I'm holding your hard drives
in my hand.

20:43.610 --> 20:45.578
All your secret communications.

20:45.612 --> 20:48.415
Enough to send you away
forever.

20:48.448 --> 20:49.916
Bravo, Michael.

20:49.949 --> 20:51.484
However you got in there, bravo.

20:51.518 --> 20:53.786
You sent me to the zoo
so you could get into

20:53.820 --> 20:54.954
my office.
But you and I both know

20:54.987 --> 20:56.456
your threat's a hollow one,

20:56.489 --> 20:58.257
because you know
I've got something

20:58.291 --> 21:00.427
that's even more valuable
to you: your son.

21:00.460 --> 21:02.261
So we're back to game theory.

21:02.295 --> 21:03.963
Do we work together,
make a trade

21:03.996 --> 21:05.465
so we both get what we want?

21:05.498 --> 21:06.933
Or are you gonna
try something underhanded?

21:06.966 --> 21:08.167
You know I will.

21:08.200 --> 21:09.936
As will I. So why don't we

21:09.969 --> 21:11.438
cut past that and make a deal?

21:11.471 --> 21:13.172
Sure, Michael. Yeah,

21:13.205 --> 21:14.173
let's do that.

21:14.206 --> 21:15.241
Old shipyard.

21:15.274 --> 21:16.576
Warehouse A.

21:16.609 --> 21:17.910
5:00 p.m. tomorrow.

21:17.944 --> 21:19.312
Fine.

21:20.347 --> 21:21.614
(distant siren wails)

21:25.485 --> 21:27.454
Uh, excuse me?

21:27.487 --> 21:29.922
My brother-in-law...
did-did Lincoln Burrows,

21:29.956 --> 21:31.257
did he get moved?

21:31.290 --> 21:32.825
No, ma'am.
He checked himself out.

21:32.859 --> 21:34.927
He was down a
lot of blood.
I know.

21:34.961 --> 21:36.829
We tried to stop him,
but if a patient insists,

21:36.863 --> 21:38.998
if it's within their power,
we have to let 'em go.

21:39.031 --> 21:40.333
Uh, this is
Dr. Ballard.

21:40.367 --> 21:42.034
He did the surgery.
Hi,

21:42.068 --> 21:43.936
Sara Scofield, I'm an internist,
actually, up at Ithaca.

21:43.970 --> 21:46.038
Do you have any idea where my
brother-in-law might have gone?

21:46.072 --> 21:47.273
No idea.

21:47.306 --> 21:48.375
Right.

21:48.408 --> 21:49.509
What happened
up in Finger Lakes,

21:49.542 --> 21:51.110
do you know?
Another gunshot victim

21:51.143 --> 21:52.879
came in from
the same area

21:52.912 --> 21:54.514
at the same time.

21:56.215 --> 21:58.050
My brother-in-law was alone.
It must be a coincidence.

21:58.084 --> 21:59.852
But thank you.

21:59.886 --> 22:01.654
Well, I'm heading out.
I've done what I can.

22:01.688 --> 22:03.523
He's on life support
up on three,

22:03.556 --> 22:05.992
but candidly, I don't think
he's making it till morning.

22:20.106 --> 22:21.608
(exhales quietly)

22:30.249 --> 22:31.250
LINCOLN:
Luca.

22:35.221 --> 22:37.089
You had me running there
for a bit,

22:37.123 --> 22:38.324
thinking I'd done
something wrong.

22:38.357 --> 22:42.061
You did.
You stiffed me $100 grand.

22:42.094 --> 22:43.930
Nah. It's blood money.

22:43.963 --> 22:45.698
No debts with blood money.

22:46.933 --> 22:48.935
Say we're clear.

22:51.237 --> 22:52.204
Eat me, Burrows.

22:52.238 --> 22:53.906
(grunts)

22:53.940 --> 22:55.542
(grunts)

22:57.243 --> 22:59.846
Say we're clear.

22:59.879 --> 23:01.681
I'm gonna get more guys.

23:01.714 --> 23:03.883
(coughs) And you're gonna
be running again.

23:03.916 --> 23:05.117
(sirens approaching rapidly)

23:05.151 --> 23:06.318
Not this time.

23:07.787 --> 23:08.955
LUCA: Are those
your fake friends again?

23:08.988 --> 23:10.957
You son of a bitch.

23:10.990 --> 23:12.459
No. This time,

23:12.492 --> 23:14.260
they're real.

23:14.293 --> 23:16.395
(sirens wailing)

23:16.429 --> 23:17.697
Federal agents!

23:17.730 --> 23:19.432
Hands where I can see 'em!

23:19.466 --> 23:20.733
Hands up!
LUCA:
Burrows!

23:20.767 --> 23:21.868
AGENT:
Do it now!

23:21.901 --> 23:23.436
Burrows!

23:24.471 --> 23:26.906
(respirator pumping)

23:35.414 --> 23:37.717
I need your help.

23:37.750 --> 23:40.019
I need to
find my boy.

23:52.198 --> 23:54.467
Here.

24:04.343 --> 24:05.344
(grunts)

24:07.346 --> 24:09.916
He's an evil man
and he's got my son.

24:09.949 --> 24:11.918
You've got to know someone.

24:11.951 --> 24:13.119
Something.

24:13.152 --> 24:16.122
Some way I can get my boy back.

24:18.224 --> 24:19.458
(gags)

24:20.493 --> 24:21.628
Please.

24:21.661 --> 24:23.863
(swallows hard)

24:23.896 --> 24:25.532
(gags)

24:38.210 --> 24:39.646
(gags)

24:39.679 --> 24:41.814
You sure
this is where my son is?

24:41.848 --> 24:43.082
Uh-huh.

24:45.217 --> 24:47.153
Thank you.

24:55.695 --> 24:57.096
(grunts)

25:01.500 --> 25:03.035
(swallows hard)

25:07.707 --> 25:09.842
It's all right.

25:12.511 --> 25:13.813
T-BAG:
Killing ain't right.

25:13.846 --> 25:15.014
WHIP:
Yeah, I read the Bible.

25:15.047 --> 25:16.215
T-BAG:
You did?

25:16.248 --> 25:17.917
You know, I scanned it once
in a hotel room.

25:17.950 --> 25:19.552
Well, what you gonna do?

25:19.586 --> 25:21.153
Don't kill anybody unless
they really deserve it.

25:21.187 --> 25:22.388
Yeah, you must've read
the Old Testament part.

25:22.421 --> 25:23.890
An eye for an eye,
a tooth for a tooth.

25:23.923 --> 25:24.991
Sure, whatever.

25:25.024 --> 25:26.325
Yeah, I'm just saying,

25:26.358 --> 25:28.928
sometimes, certain--
certain sons of bitches,

25:28.961 --> 25:30.863
they just need to be
plain old eradicated.

25:30.897 --> 25:32.565
Mm-hmm.
World's just better
minus them.

25:32.599 --> 25:34.500
Like Abu Ramal.

25:34.533 --> 25:36.903
But for the most part,
you know, killing's just bad.

25:36.936 --> 25:38.504
Yeah, absolutely.

25:38.537 --> 25:40.873
Except Poseidon.
(sighs)

25:40.907 --> 25:42.441
Yeah, he's got to go, too.
Got to go.

25:42.474 --> 25:43.876
I just don't want you
to get the wrong idea

25:43.910 --> 25:45.111
about me, okay?
Okay.

25:45.144 --> 25:47.213
You got to see it
like the yogis, okay?

25:47.246 --> 25:50.416
Destroying the negative
to create the positive.

25:50.449 --> 25:53.385
The dance of the Shivas
and all that.

25:53.419 --> 25:55.822
Murder the dark, so the--
the light can be born.

25:57.624 --> 25:59.291
You're out of your
damn tree, aren't you?

25:59.325 --> 26:01.293
Now you know
where you got it from.
Great.

26:02.929 --> 26:04.563
T-BAG: Is there a
BlueHawaii in there?

26:04.597 --> 26:06.833
BLUEHAWAII: Yeah, don't
just dillydally, come on in.

26:08.601 --> 26:12.204
I assume you two desperados
are Scofield's guys.

26:12.238 --> 26:14.006
Yeah.

26:15.241 --> 26:16.809
He get you out of prison, too?

26:16.843 --> 26:18.044
T-BAG:
No.

26:18.077 --> 26:20.479
But I do owe him.

26:20.512 --> 26:22.148
Where'd he break you out of?

26:22.181 --> 26:24.550
Barranquilla, South America.

26:24.583 --> 26:26.552
They were gonna eat my lunch
down there,

26:26.585 --> 26:28.554
pretty boy like me.

26:28.587 --> 26:31.724
Scofield took pity.

26:31.758 --> 26:34.026
Saw a talent in me, I guess.
Got me out.

26:35.795 --> 26:37.997
Said he might call on those
talents some day in return,

26:38.030 --> 26:39.331
and now here we are.

26:40.633 --> 26:43.002
Soon as I put
the touches on this,

26:43.035 --> 26:44.771
I'm yours. Got bored waiting.

26:44.804 --> 26:46.405
It's incredible.

26:46.438 --> 26:49.108
Rebuild of Dealey Plaza,

26:49.141 --> 26:51.678
where JFK was shot.

26:51.711 --> 26:53.579
This here

26:53.612 --> 26:56.415
is a book depository.

26:56.448 --> 26:57.817
WHIP: Attention to
detail like that,

26:57.850 --> 26:58.951
drive a man crazy.

26:58.985 --> 27:01.821
Look at me.
I'm a crap house loon.

27:01.854 --> 27:03.255
Excessive need to bring the past

27:03.289 --> 27:05.692
back to life.

27:05.725 --> 27:07.493
Make it real.

27:10.029 --> 27:12.398
But enough of that.

27:14.834 --> 27:17.069
Time for the real dance
to begin, am I right?

27:22.742 --> 27:24.176
We're going to get
him back, okay?

27:24.210 --> 27:27.213
WHIP: We got your wild card
ready to go.

27:29.581 --> 27:31.217
MICHAEL:
Thank you.

27:32.518 --> 27:33.953
Me that should be thanking you.

27:33.986 --> 27:35.321
You brought me all this way.

27:35.354 --> 27:36.622
We did it together.

27:36.655 --> 27:38.324
We'll be doing this together.

27:40.426 --> 27:42.829
You gave me family.

27:42.862 --> 27:44.230
Seriously, thank you.

27:45.698 --> 27:46.899
Speaking of family...

27:52.204 --> 27:53.773
LINCOLN:
Let's go.

27:59.678 --> 28:02.381
Don't touch that, please.

28:02.414 --> 28:05.051
It's not an option right now.

28:26.939 --> 28:29.075
Now where is my son?

28:29.108 --> 28:31.844
You ask questions you know
there isn't a chance in hell

28:31.878 --> 28:33.245
I'm gonna answer.

28:33.279 --> 28:35.047
So we're back to the game.

28:35.081 --> 28:37.683
The truth is, we never left.

28:37.716 --> 28:39.251
You're not holding
the cards.

28:39.285 --> 28:41.353
I am.
Are you?

28:41.387 --> 28:44.223
Every law agency in the
world is looking for you.

28:44.256 --> 28:46.525
Doesn't sound like a
position of power to me.

28:46.558 --> 28:49.095
If I get arrested,
those servers will be released,

28:49.128 --> 28:51.297
and everything you've done
will be exposed.

28:51.330 --> 28:53.265
I'll find them.
I'll destroy them.

28:53.299 --> 28:55.701
Like I said,

28:55.734 --> 28:57.870
I'm holding the cards.

28:57.904 --> 29:00.106
Whoa!

29:00.139 --> 29:01.874
Didn't expect that.

29:01.908 --> 29:03.075
It's beneath you, Michael.

29:03.109 --> 29:05.778
Let him go!

29:11.650 --> 29:14.753
Now that, I expected.

29:14.787 --> 29:16.889
JACOB:
Thank you.

29:16.923 --> 29:18.791
(gun clicks)

29:18.825 --> 29:20.759
WHIP:
How about we drop it, lady?

29:20.793 --> 29:22.929
JACOB:
You don't think
I expected this?

29:22.962 --> 29:24.931
We could do this all day.

29:24.964 --> 29:26.498
Play contingency
after contingency.

29:26.532 --> 29:28.100
But do you really
want to do that?

29:28.134 --> 29:29.635
(gunshot)
Ah!

29:29.668 --> 29:31.337
T-BAG:
No! David. Dammit!

29:31.370 --> 29:33.739
Back off, or
I kill him right now.

29:33.772 --> 29:36.943
JACOB:
And that must be

29:36.976 --> 29:38.344
the last of your
contingencies.

29:38.377 --> 29:40.346
Thank you so much for
showing me, Michael.

29:40.379 --> 29:42.414
(sirens wailing)

29:42.448 --> 29:43.950
Oh, yeah.

29:43.983 --> 29:46.252
You should also know
I called the FBI.

29:46.285 --> 29:48.754
An anonymous
tip saying

29:48.787 --> 29:51.023
that Kaniel Outis
would be at this warehouse.

30:08.040 --> 30:10.509
(indistinct radio chatter)

30:12.845 --> 30:14.881
Keep clear.
Moving to second position.

30:14.914 --> 30:16.315
JACOB:
Okay,

30:16.348 --> 30:18.317
they're in the building.
There's no more time.

30:18.350 --> 30:20.019
The hard drives,
or we'll start shooting

30:20.052 --> 30:21.287
your pieces.
WHIP: Hand over

30:21.320 --> 30:22.288
the damn boy!

30:22.321 --> 30:24.290
Shut up.

30:24.323 --> 30:26.492
Lady, put the gun down,
walk away,

30:26.525 --> 30:28.394
as I cannot be held accountable
for what's about to happen.

30:28.427 --> 30:30.062
He moves, shoot him!
I killed a guy

30:30.096 --> 30:31.797
in a bar fight once.
He was taking yang to my girl.

30:31.830 --> 30:34.366
Took me one
second to do it.
Don't do it!

30:34.400 --> 30:36.068
You should listen to him.
He's a very smart man.

30:36.102 --> 30:37.169
I'm talking to you, Whip.

30:39.005 --> 30:41.573
It's not worth dying for.
This is my fight!

30:41.607 --> 30:43.409
This is our fight. We've
come too far to let this

30:43.442 --> 30:44.310
son of a bitch win.

30:44.343 --> 30:45.644
MICHAEL:
This wasn't the plan!

30:45.677 --> 30:46.512
Don't do it!

30:46.545 --> 30:47.846
Some sons of bitches
just got to go!

30:47.880 --> 30:49.081
We're the only ones
who could do it.

30:49.115 --> 30:50.182
Ain't that right, Pa?
David!

30:50.216 --> 30:51.217
A&W:
Try me.

30:58.290 --> 30:59.491
Whip!

30:59.525 --> 31:00.492
(grunting)

31:00.526 --> 31:02.728
(gunshot, Whip groans)

31:02.761 --> 31:04.196
No!

31:07.266 --> 31:09.401
Whip. Whip.
T-BAG: No.

31:09.435 --> 31:11.437
Come on.
Whip.

31:11.470 --> 31:13.172
This wasn't the plan.

31:13.205 --> 31:15.041
Stay-stay with me.

31:15.074 --> 31:16.442
Stay with me, boy.
Stay with me.

31:16.475 --> 31:19.745
JACOB:
The hard drives. Now.

31:23.315 --> 31:25.384
I got him.
It's okay, I got him.
(groaning)

31:27.786 --> 31:29.055
(Whip panting)

31:36.228 --> 31:37.629
It's that way.

31:40.766 --> 31:42.601
T-BAG:
Keep it calm, boy.

31:42.634 --> 31:45.304
(Whip groaning, panting)

31:45.337 --> 31:47.039
Stay calm.
If he tries to play hero, too,

31:47.073 --> 31:50.309
execute him.

31:50.342 --> 31:51.710
(Whip panting)

31:51.743 --> 31:53.479
(T-Bag sobbing roughly)

31:53.512 --> 31:54.746
T-BAG:
David...

31:54.780 --> 31:56.148
(sobs)

31:56.182 --> 31:58.750
You shot him, you bitch.

31:58.784 --> 32:00.319
David...
A&W:
He shouldn't have tried me.

32:00.352 --> 32:02.254
David...
AGENT:
Hands up! Freeze!

32:02.288 --> 32:04.090
Do it now!
Federal agents!

32:04.123 --> 32:06.425
(agents shouting over
each other)

32:06.458 --> 32:07.459
(grunts)

32:07.493 --> 32:08.827
(grunting)

32:12.098 --> 32:13.332
(cracks)

32:13.365 --> 32:14.967
Federal agents!

32:15.001 --> 32:17.569
Hands where I can see them!

32:17.603 --> 32:20.306
(grunting)

32:20.339 --> 32:21.607
I'm...

32:21.640 --> 32:23.575
I'm good. I got to s...

32:23.609 --> 32:25.611
see your face.

32:27.046 --> 32:29.481
AGENT: Freeze!
Get your hands up!

32:31.217 --> 32:33.219
Go easy, son.

32:36.822 --> 32:38.824
*

32:44.963 --> 32:46.965
(agents shouting indistinctly)

32:55.574 --> 32:57.576
*

33:05.484 --> 33:07.119
How we doing?

33:07.153 --> 33:08.987
Hey.

33:09.021 --> 33:10.556
Better than you.

33:15.094 --> 33:16.995
Oh, thank God.

33:17.029 --> 33:18.897
You okay?

33:18.930 --> 33:21.200
Oh.

33:24.903 --> 33:28.074
Up ahead, in the next bay.

33:28.107 --> 33:30.076
(phone rings)

33:31.943 --> 33:33.845
I'll take that call.

33:35.681 --> 33:38.016
We got him, Michael.
We got our boy.

33:43.021 --> 33:45.557
Good news for you.

33:45.591 --> 33:48.694
But now you've got no reason
to give me what I want.

33:48.727 --> 33:51.563
Which kind of makes it
bad news for you.

33:52.564 --> 33:53.665
(door bangs open)

33:53.699 --> 33:54.900
Federal agents!

34:21.327 --> 34:22.828
You son of a bitch.

34:30.136 --> 34:31.637
(short chuckle)

34:33.139 --> 34:34.440
The cabin.

34:42.248 --> 34:44.516
Gaines' jacket.

34:45.684 --> 34:47.819
Camera, taking my picture.

34:53.592 --> 34:54.826
Blanks.

34:56.695 --> 34:59.131
You wanted me to take the
gun from you back there.

35:00.299 --> 35:01.800
You're better than I thought.

35:01.833 --> 35:05.304
Re-framing me for the murder
I actually committed.

35:05.337 --> 35:07.639
The one you framed me for.

35:07.673 --> 35:10.075
JACOB:
Michael, pick up the body,

35:10.108 --> 35:11.477
make it look like
it never happened.

35:11.510 --> 35:13.412
Genius, really.

35:13.445 --> 35:14.946
But no one will ever go for it.

35:14.980 --> 35:17.883
The truth is whatever
you tell people it is.

35:20.186 --> 35:21.687
You taught me that.

35:21.720 --> 35:23.955
Oh. Too bad the feds'll be here

35:23.989 --> 35:25.524
in two minutes, see your little

35:25.557 --> 35:27.693
diorama here, and
know it's all bull.

35:27.726 --> 35:29.828
Except none of this
will be here.

35:29.861 --> 35:31.597
And neither will I.

35:31.630 --> 35:32.898
(truck engine starts)

35:36.968 --> 35:38.170
Bastard!

35:40.472 --> 35:42.007
(grunting)

36:09.535 --> 36:11.036
(shouts)

36:15.907 --> 36:17.609
Aah!

36:19.678 --> 36:20.679
(board clatters)

36:21.947 --> 36:24.015
(panting)

36:29.087 --> 36:31.257
This is for
the last seven years.

36:35.461 --> 36:37.929
AGENT:
Freeze! Get your hands up!

36:37.963 --> 36:39.331
Put 'em up!

36:39.365 --> 36:43.201
It's him! It's Kaniel Outis!

36:43.235 --> 36:45.103
Thank God you're here.

36:45.136 --> 36:46.872
Thank God!

36:46.905 --> 36:49.007
Thank God.
(sobs)

36:49.040 --> 36:51.009
Thank God.

36:51.042 --> 36:52.210
AGENT:
Hands up!

36:52.244 --> 36:53.612
AGENT 2:
Hold on.

36:53.645 --> 36:55.714
All right,
we're clear!

36:55.747 --> 36:57.783
(indistinct radio chatter)

37:03.422 --> 37:05.391
Thank God you guys
got here when you did,

37:05.424 --> 37:07.058
that's all I can say.

37:07.092 --> 37:08.594
I mean, he would have...

37:08.627 --> 37:10.562
I'd be dead right now.

37:10.596 --> 37:13.098
Look, if it's okay with you
guys, I'd like to go home,

37:13.131 --> 37:15.634
clean myself up a bit.
As you can imagine,

37:15.667 --> 37:17.269
it's been a long day.

37:17.303 --> 37:18.570
That's okay.

37:18.604 --> 37:19.971
Thank you.

37:21.807 --> 37:24.042
Jacob Anton Ness?

37:24.075 --> 37:27.713
Can I help you?
You're under arrest for the
participation in the murder

37:27.746 --> 37:29.748
of Harlan Gaines.
If you're talking about
that nonsense

37:29.781 --> 37:30.749
in there...
We're talking about
blood evidence

37:30.782 --> 37:31.750
found in your office

37:31.783 --> 37:33.985
at the university.
An office

37:34.019 --> 37:35.587
only you have access to.

37:35.621 --> 37:37.289
Harlan Gaines' blood.

37:37.323 --> 37:38.624
MICHAEL:
And blood will finally

37:38.657 --> 37:41.427
be spilled
in its rightful place.

37:45.030 --> 37:46.998
What? How...

37:57.809 --> 37:59.511
MICHAEL:
These are the missing frames
from the night of the killing.

37:59.545 --> 38:01.012
The ones Poseidon edited out.

38:01.046 --> 38:03.181
Yes, I was there.
I've never denied it.

38:03.214 --> 38:05.183
He forced me to...

38:05.216 --> 38:08.153
so he could frame me.

38:08.186 --> 38:10.589
So the blood evidence
found in your belongings

38:10.622 --> 38:13.191
was because he tasked you
with disposing of the body.

38:13.224 --> 38:16.094
Correct.

38:16.127 --> 38:18.697
And with the revelation of
the additional blood evidence

38:18.730 --> 38:20.999
found in his office
at the university,

38:21.032 --> 38:24.302
it neatly supports your
theory, doesn't it?

38:24.336 --> 38:26.505
That he was there.

38:26.538 --> 38:28.273
That he was the gunman.

38:28.306 --> 38:32.010
I guess I would have
one question for you.

38:35.514 --> 38:37.483
I'm director of the CIA.

38:37.516 --> 38:39.785
I'm aware of that.
That's why I sent you the e-mail

38:39.818 --> 38:41.286
with the evidence directly.

38:41.319 --> 38:43.689
My question is...

38:43.722 --> 38:45.491
would you be
manipulating me, too?

38:45.524 --> 38:46.992
How would I do that?

38:47.025 --> 38:50.195
Well...

38:50.228 --> 38:52.364
you look too closely
at this evidence--

38:52.398 --> 38:55.567
metadata in the pictures,
degraded blood evidence--

38:55.601 --> 38:56.968
you might find
some problems.

38:57.002 --> 38:59.304
Depends how motivated you are
to look closely.

38:59.337 --> 39:01.306
Poseidon killed
your deputy director.

39:01.339 --> 39:04.309
He was a cancer
inside your agency for years.

39:04.342 --> 39:06.077
I've shown you his face!

39:06.111 --> 39:08.880
Now, calm down.

39:08.914 --> 39:11.683
You should know that we
have Mr. Ness' accomplice,

39:11.717 --> 39:15.353
Andrew Nelson, in custody,

39:15.387 --> 39:17.556
thanks to your brother.

39:17.589 --> 39:19.057
Once we saw your e-mail,

39:19.090 --> 39:20.692
we interrogated him.

39:20.726 --> 39:23.495
He's fully disclosed 21-Void's

39:23.529 --> 39:26.598
conspiracy to frame you for
the murder of Harlan Gaines

39:26.632 --> 39:30.235
and bury your identity
by giving you a new one:

39:30.268 --> 39:32.203
Kaniel Outis.

39:32.237 --> 39:33.439
What does that mean?

39:33.472 --> 39:35.140
It means...

39:37.075 --> 39:38.977
...you're free to go,
Mr. Scofield.

39:49.154 --> 39:50.622
You don't know
how long I've waited

39:50.656 --> 39:52.290
to hear someone call me that.

40:03.001 --> 40:04.536
One other thing.

40:04.570 --> 40:06.404
The level of ingenuity

40:06.438 --> 40:09.074
that you displayed
with all of this--

40:09.107 --> 40:11.543
we could use a
person like that.

40:11.577 --> 40:13.044
I am not looking for a job.

40:13.078 --> 40:14.345
Right.

40:21.520 --> 40:24.255
There is one thing
you can do for me.

40:30.095 --> 40:31.296
You liking it here?

40:31.329 --> 40:33.599
MICHAEL:
It's strange.

40:33.632 --> 40:35.601
Being alive again.

40:35.634 --> 40:37.636
Not running.

40:40.305 --> 40:42.273
Yeah.

40:42.307 --> 40:44.309
I've been running, too.

40:45.511 --> 40:47.345
I know.

40:47.378 --> 40:49.247
(laughter)

40:49.280 --> 40:50.582
He threw you
out of a boat.

40:50.616 --> 40:53.619
Why'd you call her?

40:53.652 --> 40:55.621
Because I knew
you wouldn't.

40:55.654 --> 40:57.222
(short chuckle)

41:02.193 --> 41:04.162
What's really strange is...

41:04.195 --> 41:06.732
things actually working out.

41:09.334 --> 41:11.336
Yeah.

41:16.141 --> 41:17.475
I love you.

41:18.710 --> 41:20.846
I love you, too.

41:20.879 --> 41:22.347
*

41:22.380 --> 41:23.982
He's better at
getting himself into...

41:24.015 --> 41:26.017
(chuckling)

41:27.986 --> 41:30.055
He's stubborn.

41:30.088 --> 41:31.322
Hey.

41:31.356 --> 41:33.692
Hey, babe.

41:33.725 --> 41:34.993
Hmm.

41:39.831 --> 41:42.233
(heavy door rolls shut)

41:42.267 --> 41:44.269
*

41:45.871 --> 41:47.606
(indistinct chatter)

41:49.541 --> 41:51.743
GUARD:
Not used to guys smiling,
coming in here.

41:51.777 --> 41:53.378
Yeah, just not planning
on sticking around long,

41:53.411 --> 41:54.813
that's all.

41:54.846 --> 41:56.915
Yeah, right.

42:01.286 --> 42:03.288
Have a good one.

42:05.791 --> 42:07.793
(exhales)

42:22.273 --> 42:24.542
No. No, no, no, no, no, no,

42:24.576 --> 42:26.211
no! No! No!

42:26.244 --> 42:28.379
Guard! Guard!

42:28.413 --> 42:30.949
(T-Bag cackling)

42:30.982 --> 42:35.086
(Jacob screaming)
