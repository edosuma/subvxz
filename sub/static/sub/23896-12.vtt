WEBVTT

00:15.640 --> 00:16.474
I can't. Not yet.

00:18.810 --> 00:19.644
Fair enough.

00:20.603 --> 00:21.730
Tomorrow it is then.

00:26.568 --> 00:29.070
I need time to conduct tests
on Isobel's brain anyway.

00:29.487 --> 00:31.573
I feel like I'm getting close
to a vaccine.

00:31.740 --> 00:33.450
Take as much time as you need.

00:35.910 --> 00:36.745
Hey.

00:37.078 --> 00:38.413
You manage to get some sleep?

00:38.663 --> 00:39.664
Not really.

00:40.832 --> 00:43.835
You two seen the latest tweet
from the official Fillmore Graves account?

00:44.127 --> 00:45.420
What fresh hell?

00:45.628 --> 00:48.381
"Human smuggler Curtis Lim
will be executed in two days

00:48.465 --> 00:52.093
unless Renegade surrenders
to @FillmoreGraves US authorities."

00:53.928 --> 00:54.763
Liv...

00:55.597 --> 00:57.932
You understand
you are too important to the Railroad.

00:58.099 --> 00:59.476
You cannot turn yourself in.

00:59.684 --> 01:03.480
You are too valuable to me, to the city,
and to the people who love you.

01:03.897 --> 01:04.814
Repeat after me,

01:05.148 --> 01:08.651
"I will not turn myself in
to Fillmore Graves."

01:09.736 --> 01:11.654
I won't turn myself in.

01:25.126 --> 01:25.960
Major!

01:26.044 --> 01:27.879
Give me a minute, someone's at the door.

01:36.095 --> 01:37.055
Lillywhite.

01:37.388 --> 01:38.848
Captain Hobbs.

01:39.057 --> 01:40.683
-This is...

01:40.850 --> 01:42.477
I was looking for a stronger word.

01:43.228 --> 01:44.437
Come in.

01:46.898 --> 01:50.110
Listen, what happened to those soldiers
in your unit last night...

01:50.485 --> 01:51.486
Chase crossed the line.

01:51.820 --> 01:52.779
I'm sorry.

01:53.571 --> 01:55.657
All of this violence, this unrest,

01:55.740 --> 01:58.493
we're losing the few friends
we have in Washington.

01:59.869 --> 02:02.872
Our allies need a sign
that we're righting the ship.

02:04.040 --> 02:05.208
We need new leadership.

02:06.793 --> 02:10.964
Well, if you want,
literally the worst job in America,

02:12.465 --> 02:13.299
I'll support you.

02:14.509 --> 02:15.760
No, um...

02:16.970 --> 02:20.932
Fillmore Graves has never been led
by a pencil pusher.

02:21.349 --> 02:23.977
A soldier leads Fillmore Graves.

02:24.310 --> 02:27.730
A soldier respected by the men and women
who make up our fighting force.

02:29.315 --> 02:30.608
A soldier like you.

02:34.863 --> 02:35.989
Who was it?

02:36.656 --> 02:37.991
Captain Hobbs.

02:38.324 --> 02:40.201
What did that whiny kiss

02:42.662 --> 02:43.830
-Suffer.

02:44.789 --> 02:47.750
He wants to overthrow Chase
and install me as the new Commander.

02:48.418 --> 02:52.505
I meant what did that brilliant strategist
and white knight of the rebellion want?

02:52.755 --> 02:54.090
Put the thought out of your mind.

02:54.173 --> 02:55.800
You'd have the backing of the soldiers.

02:56.092 --> 02:58.344
-You're the guy who could do it.
-I don't want it.

02:58.469 --> 03:00.346
You see the latest tweet
from the Fillmore Graves account?

03:00.471 --> 03:01.306
Mmm-mmm.

03:01.890 --> 03:06.144
Chase is going to execute some
human smuggler unless Renegade surrenders.

03:06.936 --> 03:08.021
Good luck on that.

03:08.313 --> 03:11.149
Like Renegade's just going to walk in
and say, "Here I am.

03:11.357 --> 03:13.109
Let's get to head smashing."

03:13.985 --> 03:15.278
<i>Chase is out of control.</i>

03:15.403 --> 03:16.946
<i>If we're going to survive as a species</i>

03:17.030 --> 03:19.073
<i>and as force capable of keeping the peace,</i>

03:19.157 --> 03:20.074
<i>he's gotta go.</i>

03:20.158 --> 03:22.035
Lillywhite can't be trusted.

03:23.119 --> 03:24.662
You've lost him, sir.

03:29.751 --> 03:31.252
That's all, Captain Hobbs.

03:37.842 --> 03:41.387
Sorry, just making sure
Stan is all set to take Curtis' girlfriend

03:41.471 --> 03:42.722
for her sonogram.

03:44.015 --> 03:45.600
You ever been to Spain?

03:46.935 --> 03:47.769
Uh...

03:48.228 --> 03:49.479
Yeah.

03:50.688 --> 03:54.484
Peyton had this Spanish boyfriend,
sophomore year of college, Armando.

03:55.318 --> 03:58.529
We all spent a week
on the coast of Majorca.

03:59.239 --> 04:00.740
Beaches were so beautiful.

04:01.574 --> 04:05.620
It was like the edge of the world,
just blue water and open sky.

04:08.122 --> 04:10.166
Would've been nice to have met you then.

04:10.917 --> 04:11.834
When were you there?

04:12.335 --> 04:14.087
In 2005.

04:14.879 --> 04:17.215
I was in Spain, summer of 2005.

04:17.423 --> 04:18.758
-Shut up.
-Yeah.

04:19.175 --> 04:20.635
But I was in Barcelona.

04:20.718 --> 04:22.303
I flew in to Barcelona.

04:22.929 --> 04:24.847
Maybe we passed each other at the airport.

04:25.640 --> 04:26.891
Nope.

04:30.186 --> 04:31.271
I would have remembered you.

04:31.813 --> 04:35.191
I doubt you'd remember a girl
you saw at the airport.

04:35.400 --> 04:36.317
Over ten years ago.

04:36.484 --> 04:37.527
Trust me, I would have.

04:39.529 --> 04:42.115
There's probably hundreds of guys

04:42.657 --> 04:45.410
that remember you fondly
as the girl from the airport.

04:46.661 --> 04:49.289
Or that girl from the line at the DMV.

04:51.958 --> 04:54.252
See

05:19.777 --> 05:21.070
Hey, sista.

05:21.654 --> 05:24.198
I think you were good
with the one you took 40 minutes ago,

05:24.365 --> 05:27.285
how about taking a lap?
I'm paying you to mingle.

05:27.368 --> 05:29.620
-You really need to stop yelling at me.

05:30.330 --> 05:33.166
I am under so much pressure right now.

05:35.168 --> 05:36.044
You're taking a lap.

05:38.463 --> 05:39.797
-Mmm-hmm.

05:40.256 --> 05:42.175
And my drink. And get me water.

05:43.426 --> 05:45.136
Who wants a selfie with the White Girl?

05:45.470 --> 05:47.263
Yeah!

06:07.784 --> 06:09.077
Major.

06:10.286 --> 06:12.163
I was just working up
the courage to knock.

06:13.539 --> 06:14.957
I should have listened to you.

06:16.250 --> 06:17.627
You were right about Chase.

06:18.044 --> 06:19.253
You were right about everything.

06:19.754 --> 06:22.090
And now you're turning yourself in
to save Curtis.

06:22.548 --> 06:24.383
You're not gonna talk me out of this.

06:25.426 --> 06:26.302
I know.

06:26.969 --> 06:29.764
But I wanted to say goodbye.

06:32.391 --> 06:34.185
I wanted us to part on good terms.

07:00.878 --> 07:01.838
Hello.

07:02.046 --> 07:03.089
Ravi... Is Liv with you?

07:06.175 --> 07:07.176
Oh, God!

07:22.108 --> 07:23.192
Hey, buddy.

07:23.943 --> 07:24.944
Where are we?

07:25.903 --> 07:27.029
Oregon.

07:31.576 --> 07:32.743
What the hell, dude?

07:32.910 --> 07:34.245
I've been ringing Major
and he won't pick up.

07:34.745 --> 07:37.832
Yeah, he asked me to give you a message
when you showed up.

07:37.999 --> 07:39.041
Did he?

07:39.292 --> 07:40.501
He told me to tell you

07:40.710 --> 07:43.671
that he took Liv out of Seattle
to keep her from surrendering.

07:43.963 --> 07:46.966
Oh, yeah, and he told me
that Liv is Renegade. That's wild.

07:47.133 --> 07:49.510
Hold on, hold on.
By "took her out of Seattle", you mean...

07:49.635 --> 07:51.387
He kind of kidnapped her.

07:53.890 --> 07:55.057
He kidnapped her?

07:55.933 --> 07:58.019
Any idea when he plans
on bringing her back?

07:58.269 --> 08:00.771
Well, apparently Major is gonna
wait out Curtis' execution

08:00.855 --> 08:02.732
and return with Liv
once it's too late to surrender.

08:03.107 --> 08:04.025
Right.

08:04.108 --> 08:06.486
But given the options,
I don't think this is the worst news.

08:07.403 --> 08:08.738
I appreciate the update.

08:09.113 --> 08:10.281
<i>Let me know if you hear anything else.</i>

08:10.656 --> 08:11.908
-Bye.
<i>-Bye.</i>

08:13.576 --> 08:14.952
Is Curtis gonna be okay?

08:20.082 --> 08:21.626
Murder solving time!

08:21.709 --> 08:22.752
You're here, good.

08:22.835 --> 08:25.046
I've got more details
from White Girl's autopsy.

08:25.213 --> 08:26.672
Yeah, I'm not calling her that.

08:27.673 --> 08:30.092
-Cause of death was--
-Hammer to the back of the head.

08:30.676 --> 08:33.763
Vampire Steve forwarded me the last video
found on McKenna's phone.

08:33.971 --> 08:35.932
Taken in a bathroom
at The Scratching Post.

08:36.015 --> 08:37.016
Take a look.

08:37.975 --> 08:39.352
Is that a snuff boomerang?

08:39.727 --> 08:42.522
The good news is McKenna
probably saw who killed her.

08:43.147 --> 08:45.024
Liv should make this a quick one.
Where is she?

08:47.151 --> 08:48.361
Funny, funny story.

08:50.404 --> 08:51.656
She's been kidnapped.

08:52.198 --> 08:53.241
It's not that funny.

08:53.366 --> 08:54.951
By Major, in a nice way.

08:56.577 --> 08:58.454
Liv is Renegade.

08:58.913 --> 09:01.999
Seattle's number one human smuggler.

09:03.167 --> 09:04.544
Chase Graves is gonna execute

09:04.627 --> 09:06.963
one of Liv's coyotes
if she doesn't surrender.

09:07.713 --> 09:08.965
I think I need to sit down.

09:09.048 --> 09:13.636
Major's keeping Liv out of Seattle
so she doesn't turn herself in to Chase.

09:13.803 --> 09:15.429
-Because she would.
-Indeed.

09:16.347 --> 09:17.390
In the meantime,

09:20.977 --> 09:23.354
it's murder solving time.

09:26.732 --> 09:28.276
Quite the YouTube sensation.

09:29.402 --> 09:31.153
You got the attention
of every zombie in the city.

09:31.737 --> 09:33.114
They hang on your every word. Not my words.

09:35.616 --> 09:36.659
His.

09:36.784 --> 09:39.287
But delivered with such panache
by his favorite apostle.

09:40.371 --> 09:45.543
So, has the big man upstairs mentioned
anything about, uh, nuclear annihilation?

09:46.294 --> 09:47.962
Nothing. Why?

09:48.629 --> 09:52.383
I've got drunk Fillmore Graves soldiers
at the bar every night

09:52.967 --> 09:55.428
babbling about the government
cutting off brain shipments.

09:55.886 --> 09:57.597
They want to make us extinct, Pop.

09:58.848 --> 10:00.141
And once the brains are cut off,

10:00.433 --> 10:03.394
either humans will destroy us
because they know we need their brains

10:03.477 --> 10:06.522
or we'll wipe them out
because we're starving.

10:07.106 --> 10:08.941
Unfortunately, that second scenario...

10:10.151 --> 10:11.402
That ends with an A-bomb.

10:11.736 --> 10:12.653
There's a reason the government

10:12.737 --> 10:16.407
has evacuated everybody
in a 30-mile ring around New Seattle.

10:16.991 --> 10:18.409
Now is the time to act.

10:18.743 --> 10:20.661
Begin slaughtering humans?

10:20.828 --> 10:21.829
No.

10:22.788 --> 10:24.707
Send your flock out into America,

10:24.957 --> 10:27.710
have them scratch, bite, fornicate, feed,

10:28.002 --> 10:30.880
turn half the world zombie,
leave the other half as food.

10:31.213 --> 10:32.340
Make your prophecy come true.

10:32.506 --> 10:34.008
It's too soon.

10:36.010 --> 10:38.179
The ways out of the city
are too well guarded,

10:38.262 --> 10:40.640
landmines, machine guns, tanks.

10:45.853 --> 10:47.605
For such a momentous undertaking

10:47.897 --> 10:49.148
I need a sign.

10:49.398 --> 10:51.400
Isn't it possible that the sign is me?

10:52.443 --> 10:54.111
Telling you that we're on
the eve of destruction?

10:56.322 --> 10:59.867
The Lord will point me
in the right direction.

11:05.122 --> 11:07.291
-Olivia!

11:07.583 --> 11:09.001
Just a moment, darling.

11:18.594 --> 11:20.721
Now doesn't that just look marvelous?

11:21.514 --> 11:22.932
Not as marvelous as you, dear.

11:23.265 --> 11:25.559
Oh. I may have freshened up a bit.

11:26.811 --> 11:28.312
I found this in the bedroom closet.

11:28.562 --> 11:30.981
I sure hope the lady of the house
won't mind my borrowing it.

11:31.816 --> 11:34.276
You could have packed
an overnight bag for me, you stinker.

11:34.568 --> 11:36.320
Why, I don't even have a nightie.

11:36.737 --> 11:37.822
Can you ever forgive me?

11:39.407 --> 11:42.368
You know, I've fixed the broken front step
and brought in the firewood.

11:42.993 --> 11:45.246
Well, I think that
deserves another martini.

11:49.125 --> 11:51.001
So, who does live here?

11:51.293 --> 11:54.713
This is a safe-house operated
by Fillmore Graves, darling.

11:56.006 --> 11:57.550
One of our married couples lives here

11:57.633 --> 12:00.052
and I can't for the life of me
figure out where they've gone.

12:00.302 --> 12:02.596
Then we'll pretend
it's ours til they return.

12:03.639 --> 12:08.144
If we wind up staying, we could put
a tomato plant right outside that window.

12:14.608 --> 12:16.360
Now, what will the neighbors think?

12:16.819 --> 12:19.238
There are no neighbors. It's just us.

12:21.323 --> 12:23.659
How I've missed being held in your arms.

12:27.621 --> 12:28.956
That's just the gin talking.

12:29.039 --> 12:30.708
No, it isn't. It's me.

12:31.500 --> 12:32.501
Isn't it?

12:33.919 --> 12:35.129
You sneaky Pete,

12:35.254 --> 12:38.340
those brain tubes we ate
weren't the regular kind, were they?

12:38.841 --> 12:41.343
They come courtesy
of a blissfully happy married couple

12:41.427 --> 12:44.763
who died together
at the ripe old age of 95.

12:46.223 --> 12:47.558
I always did want to grow old with you.

12:50.102 --> 12:52.938
I know it's not real,
but I'm having too much fun to care.

12:53.105 --> 12:55.191
Now, the brain isn't in total control.

12:55.357 --> 12:56.484
And the truth is,

12:57.109 --> 12:59.695
I'm rather fond of you, you big Magilla.

13:00.279 --> 13:01.822
That suits me just fine.

13:19.381 --> 13:22.551
I'm gonna ask you one more time
to button that.

13:22.801 --> 13:24.428
I'm proud of my body

13:24.762 --> 13:26.639
and if I want to show it, I'm going to.

13:26.805 --> 13:28.307
No one is making you look.

13:30.017 --> 13:32.269
-No.

13:33.604 --> 13:35.814
Well, can you come with me
to find the bathroom?

13:35.898 --> 13:37.608
-No.

13:38.442 --> 13:40.986
I was serious about you
buttoning that shirt.

13:47.034 --> 13:48.202
There he is, let's go.

13:48.452 --> 13:49.954
Watch how weird he is to me.

13:53.541 --> 13:55.376
Got a couple of more
questions for you, Mr. Eberhard.

13:55.459 --> 13:57.920
Oh, let's not.

13:58.003 --> 14:00.422
Wow. You're throwing shade at me

14:00.506 --> 14:03.467
when I've literally been nothing
but nice this whole time.

14:03.717 --> 14:05.970
-Stop.
-You saw how he was to me.

14:06.136 --> 14:07.137
Okay...

14:11.100 --> 14:12.351
Correct me if I'm wrong, Doc,

14:12.726 --> 14:15.563
but usually when a man's shirt
is that open

14:15.771 --> 14:17.523
someone's coming at his chest
with crash pads.

14:17.731 --> 14:19.233
I don't engage in hate speech,

14:19.441 --> 14:21.318
so I have no response for you.

14:22.653 --> 14:24.613
Can you see if they have coconut water?

14:26.490 --> 14:29.159
We have a video of McKenna
being hit with a hammer, while--

14:29.660 --> 14:31.871
-Shh. Stop, I need you.

14:32.037 --> 14:34.123
I can feel you comparing me
to Liv, you know.

14:34.206 --> 14:35.708
And you're coming up short.

14:38.210 --> 14:39.336
Is he having a vision?

14:39.670 --> 14:41.922
I think he's staring at
his reflection in the beer tap.

14:46.719 --> 14:47.678
Yeah.

14:49.972 --> 14:52.558
What

14:53.058 --> 14:54.518
This is why I can't trust you.

14:54.768 --> 14:56.437
You seemed pretty lost in thought there.

14:57.730 --> 14:59.481
You are so obsessed with me.

15:00.482 --> 15:02.651
I'm over this place, we should go.

15:03.235 --> 15:04.445
I know who we're looking for.

15:08.198 --> 15:09.158
I don't get why I'm here.

15:09.366 --> 15:11.994
My colleague had
a vision of you fighting with McKenna

15:12.119 --> 15:14.997
at The Scratching Post
during the white party last night.

15:18.500 --> 15:22.254
I remembered you from the time you had
your tongue down my friend's throat.

15:22.713 --> 15:23.756
Unfortunately.

15:24.131 --> 15:26.467
Put my tongue down a lot of throats,
you'll have to be more specific.

15:28.344 --> 15:29.970
What was your fight with McKenna about?

15:30.471 --> 15:31.597
She was a zombie.

15:32.306 --> 15:34.683
The perfect specimen
of God's chosen people.

15:34.934 --> 15:38.562
And then, she paid $14 million
to return to a human state.

15:38.979 --> 15:40.981
To walk away from God's grace.

15:41.649 --> 15:43.359
Then capitalized on our culture,

15:43.567 --> 15:45.027
our style, our look.

15:45.653 --> 15:49.198
Brother Love said becoming a zombie
means God chose you for immortality.

15:49.782 --> 15:51.700
Who is this Brother Love?

15:52.034 --> 15:52.868
He's a prophet.

15:53.535 --> 15:54.370
Oh, good.

15:54.954 --> 15:56.038
We should probably talk to him.

15:56.205 --> 15:57.039
Here...

15:58.165 --> 16:00.459
He told us that she's an apostate.

16:01.627 --> 16:03.587
<i> The cure?</i>
<i>The cure for what exactly?</i>

16:03.671 --> 16:05.506
<i>For domination</i>

16:05.965 --> 16:09.343
<i>Basking in the warmth</i>
<i>and the loving gaze of a vigilant God?</i>

16:09.426 --> 16:10.260
<i>Amen!</i>

16:11.053 --> 16:13.722
<i>She must be cleansed of this earth!</i>

16:13.973 --> 16:15.140
<i>Yeah!</i>

16:16.058 --> 16:17.017
You notice anything?

16:17.476 --> 16:20.312
That he somehow got 10,000 views
even though he's super old.

16:20.437 --> 16:21.730
No, no.

16:22.314 --> 16:24.900
The hammer. Yeah, I saw the hammer.

16:25.150 --> 16:27.444
The killer used a hammer, I'm not blind.

16:27.611 --> 16:29.321
And guess what?

16:30.531 --> 16:31.490
I'm not gonna guess.

16:31.699 --> 16:34.952
Jim Jonestown here
is Blaine DeBeers' father.

16:37.705 --> 16:39.748
That's weird, but I don't know
what it means.

16:40.082 --> 16:43.794
But did it sound to you like he just told
his congregation to kill this girl?

16:44.211 --> 16:45.337
This apostate.

16:54.638 --> 16:57.182
The people who own this house
could be home at any minute.

16:57.474 --> 16:59.935
What would they think if they found us
necking in their parlor?

17:00.144 --> 17:01.770
That I'm the luckiest guy in the world.

17:02.312 --> 17:03.814
I know you said we're in Oregon,

17:04.023 --> 17:05.691
but it feels more like cloud nine.

17:06.025 --> 17:07.818
This is how it could always be for us.

17:08.277 --> 17:11.530
We are not the problem, it's the rest
of the world that mucks everything up.

17:12.573 --> 17:14.116
What if we leave all that behind?

17:14.241 --> 17:15.492
Ignore the rest of the world.

17:18.704 --> 17:19.621
Let's never go back.

17:20.039 --> 17:20.914
How will we eat?

17:21.081 --> 17:22.791
There have to be cemeteries
around here somewhere.

17:22.875 --> 17:23.709
I'll buy a shovel.

17:24.001 --> 17:25.419
-I'll work.

17:25.544 --> 17:28.088
I'll pick apples.
I'll sell vacuums door-to-door.

17:28.922 --> 17:31.216
I just want to be with you.

17:32.092 --> 17:34.261
And, gosh, if Ravi finds a cure someday,

17:34.511 --> 17:36.972
we can go back to the way
things were before any of this happened.

17:37.222 --> 17:39.892
Before boat parties,
before zombie outbreaks.

17:40.517 --> 17:42.019
I'd be your fiancée again.

17:43.187 --> 17:44.313
You could be my wife.

17:45.022 --> 17:46.815
Mrs. Major Lillywhite.

17:51.737 --> 17:53.489
Well, that sounds perfectly lovely.

17:54.198 --> 17:55.199
Almost perfect.

17:55.824 --> 17:57.367
We're out of Tom Collins mix.

17:57.618 --> 17:59.787
There has to be some somewhere.
I'll go take a look.

18:00.746 --> 18:01.789
My hero.

18:06.293 --> 18:08.670
Now where in the Sam Hill...

18:11.799 --> 18:14.426
Really, darling,
what would you do without me?

18:16.011 --> 18:16.845
What?

18:23.477 --> 18:24.812
These are our people.

18:29.024 --> 18:30.442
You have a lovely home.

18:32.277 --> 18:34.530
It says Fillmore Graves stopped
sending brain tubes.

18:35.572 --> 18:37.366
They were afraid they'd go Romero
and hurt somebody.

18:37.699 --> 18:40.160
They decided Jeff would shoot Tammy
and then himself,

18:40.244 --> 18:42.121
but he couldn't bring himself to do it.

18:42.913 --> 18:45.541
Couldn't bear the idea of living
without her even for a moment.

19:02.766 --> 19:04.059
We sit on the other side.

19:04.643 --> 19:05.769
This side's better.

19:12.151 --> 19:13.652
Thanks for joining us, Mr. McDonough.

19:13.735 --> 19:15.529
Please, call me Brother Love. That, sir, is unlikely.

19:18.866 --> 19:19.992
Very well.

19:24.788 --> 19:26.957
Apparently, the unis
couldn't bring themselves

19:27.040 --> 19:29.710
to frisk a man of the cloth.

19:30.419 --> 19:32.462
Even when that cloth
is splattered in blood.

19:34.673 --> 19:37.467
Now, we can begin.

19:38.719 --> 19:41.722
Okay, I don't like him,
but I don't hate the cape.

19:42.681 --> 19:44.349
Blessed is he with a white streak.

19:45.267 --> 19:47.477
You must visit our church and be baptized.

19:47.978 --> 19:49.438
For we who taste

19:50.189 --> 19:51.190
can see.

19:53.525 --> 19:54.776
You people wouldn't understand.

19:56.445 --> 19:57.988
He did not just say that.

19:58.906 --> 20:00.365
Can we help you with something?

20:01.033 --> 20:03.035
Sneaky, sneaky Babineaux, huh? But no zombie case slips by me.

20:05.704 --> 20:06.997
Our victim was a human.

20:07.289 --> 20:08.916
We haven't charged a zombie suspect.

20:09.541 --> 20:12.836
As of late, accusations are being thrown
at zombies...

20:13.587 --> 20:16.673
How you say? Yeah, "dippy-dippy bon-bon."

20:17.049 --> 20:17.883
Hmm?

20:17.966 --> 20:19.760
It is important

20:19.968 --> 20:25.432
the interview be monitored in a case
involving a zombie of some notoriety.

20:25.891 --> 20:27.601
Oh, you mean
the same famous zombie

20:27.684 --> 20:30.062
who called for the vic's head
just days before her murder?

20:30.687 --> 20:31.563
It's all online.

20:31.647 --> 20:33.690
Ah. You must mean White Girl.

20:34.483 --> 20:35.776
Her name is McKenna Nuddelle.

20:36.443 --> 20:38.737
A name she hath and now she hath not.

20:39.446 --> 20:40.697
A sinner was punished.

20:41.740 --> 20:44.117
Alas, I did not cast the stone.

20:45.619 --> 20:48.121
Where were you Friday night
between 10:00 p.m. and 2:00 a.m.?

20:48.497 --> 20:49.581
At my church.

20:51.458 --> 20:55.587
Surely someone would have noticed
this priest at The Scratching Post.

20:55.796 --> 20:58.966
Maybe in <i>Pink Panther </i>movies
they don't establish alibis.

20:59.591 --> 21:02.135
But here we are with the man
who called for the victim's death.

21:02.427 --> 21:05.847
Produced a bloody weapon
similar to the one used in the murder.

21:06.139 --> 21:08.016
And showed up to his interrogation

21:09.184 --> 21:10.269
in bloody robes.

21:10.727 --> 21:12.062
I'm gonna check his alibi.

21:12.229 --> 21:15.565
I'm gonna have
his robes and hammer analyzed.

21:16.149 --> 21:18.485
And I'm gonna lock him up
until I'm satisfied

21:19.319 --> 21:20.362
he's not the killer.

21:20.529 --> 21:23.407
Enjoy your illusion of power, human.

21:25.242 --> 21:27.619
Enjoy your handcuffs, whitey.

21:31.206 --> 21:32.833
-What the--

21:33.667 --> 21:35.043
Oh, it's horrible.

21:37.629 --> 21:39.214
You should see this, Detective.

21:40.340 --> 21:42.301
Off with the robes, preacher man.

21:58.817 --> 22:00.902
Your prayers will be answered,
my children.

22:02.571 --> 22:04.489
Where are you taking him?
Release him.

22:04.573 --> 22:06.450
-Let him go!
He must be freed.

22:06.575 --> 22:09.244
These chains are but an illusion.

22:09.828 --> 22:13.081
God always answers the prayers
of his chosen people.

22:14.291 --> 22:17.169
Let's take him back to holding now,
then sneak him to county later.

22:17.711 --> 22:18.712
It was me!

22:21.715 --> 22:22.758
I murdered White Girl.

22:23.216 --> 22:24.968
I knew she would be
at The Scratching Post.

22:25.343 --> 22:28.388
I snuck up behind her in the bathroom
and sent her back to Hell.

22:28.513 --> 22:31.516
Good fortune awaits you, my son.
Thank you.

22:31.683 --> 22:33.935
Thank you for ridding the world
of the apostate.

22:35.103 --> 22:36.313
Ah, yes...

22:37.230 --> 22:39.733
How convenient that I was here.

22:50.911 --> 22:52.454
So, what's the story with freezing?

22:52.662 --> 22:54.664
Do they stick you in a freezer
until you're frozen

22:54.748 --> 22:56.416
or do they put you under first?

23:15.644 --> 23:16.770
This is your stop.

23:17.604 --> 23:18.688
This is the place?

23:20.107 --> 23:21.108
Your hands.

23:24.903 --> 23:27.823
So, did you actually...

23:29.032 --> 23:30.075
White Girl?

23:31.409 --> 23:32.244
Yeah.

23:32.410 --> 23:34.913
Ah. Such loyalty.

23:36.164 --> 23:37.457
This reminds me...

23:41.378 --> 23:43.296
Give this back to Brother Love.

23:44.047 --> 23:45.298
Tell him he has a friend at Fillmore Graves.

23:48.343 --> 23:49.177
Now,

23:50.095 --> 23:51.304
fly,<i> papillon.</i>

23:52.597 --> 23:53.849
You are free.

24:05.402 --> 24:06.444
Hey, baldie,

24:06.862 --> 24:08.405
I want a refund on those brains
you sold me

24:08.488 --> 24:10.323
before I come back there
and rip your head off!

24:12.784 --> 24:15.412
-Nothing, never mind.

24:15.704 --> 24:17.122
No, no, no. Come back, I want to know.

24:17.205 --> 24:20.041
I mean, as a businessman concerned
about my product.

24:20.458 --> 24:21.668
I bought these brains.

24:22.169 --> 24:23.253
Old married couple.

24:23.587 --> 24:24.546
I know the ones.

24:24.629 --> 24:26.047
Thought it'd be fun with my fiancée.

24:26.590 --> 24:27.591
It worked for a couple of days.

24:27.841 --> 24:30.927
The next thing I know, she's reliving
the memory of a freakin' car crash!

24:32.470 --> 24:34.181
It said so on the menu.

24:34.806 --> 24:36.266
Fifty happy years,

24:36.766 --> 24:38.602
died together in car crash.

24:38.727 --> 24:41.771
The menu didn't say
the wife caused the accident.

24:41.897 --> 24:43.106
-Yeah.

24:43.190 --> 24:44.608
She got so fed up with her husband singing

24:44.691 --> 24:47.027
that she grabbed the wheel
and steered him into a semi.

24:47.110 --> 24:49.946
Now, everything I do
drives my fiancée nuts.

24:50.363 --> 24:51.406
Huh.

24:53.617 --> 24:54.701
Good to know.

24:56.036 --> 24:58.997
<i>'Cause I wear a silly grin</i>

24:59.456 --> 25:03.043
<i>The moment you come into view</i>

25:04.336 --> 25:10.008
<i>Chances are you think</i>
<i>That I'm in love with you</i>

25:10.634 --> 25:11.718
I have to say

25:11.927 --> 25:14.971
I do think it would have been better
if Jeff had shot Tammy.

25:15.388 --> 25:17.390
I don't know, I think it's romantic.

25:17.974 --> 25:19.226
Romero and Juliet.

25:20.185 --> 25:22.229
You know what I have a hankering for?

25:22.687 --> 25:24.022
I know what I have a hankering for.

25:24.105 --> 25:26.191
Oh, you...

25:27.442 --> 25:30.403
I spotted that hot sauce that I love
down in the basement.

25:30.737 --> 25:32.489
Would you be a lamb and fetch it for me?

25:33.240 --> 25:35.242
Your wish is my command.

25:48.338 --> 25:51.174
I'm sorry to disturb you,
but the little lady

25:51.258 --> 25:52.926
has her heart set on hot sauce.

25:53.969 --> 25:54.803
Women.

25:57.097 --> 25:58.390
I'm just teasing, Tammy.

25:58.640 --> 26:00.350
But if it's hot sauce my Olivia wants,

26:00.600 --> 26:02.060
it's hot sauce she'll get.

26:04.104 --> 26:05.105
Here we go,

26:05.188 --> 26:07.899
let's hope this will earn
me a couple of brownie points.

26:10.527 --> 26:12.654
Olivia. What are you...

26:12.821 --> 26:15.198
I'm sorry, darling,
I really hate your singing

26:15.323 --> 26:17.784
and there's a big part of me
that isn't keen on being kidnapped.

26:17.909 --> 26:20.078
Now, Olivia, you know that I--

26:20.245 --> 26:22.330
I cannot let someone die for my crimes.

26:24.416 --> 26:25.542
Don't do this.

26:26.126 --> 26:27.502
Who am I if I don't?

26:27.711 --> 26:29.754
Well, you'll still be you.
You'll be alive.

26:29.921 --> 26:33.216
Darling, sometimes I think
you don't understand me at all.

26:33.925 --> 26:37.804
But I would really appreciate if you
tell me where you hid the car keys.

26:38.638 --> 26:39.889
No.

26:39.973 --> 26:41.349
Hmm. Then, that's that.

26:42.726 --> 26:43.935
Sweetheart, now, really,

26:44.269 --> 26:45.979
you're not just gonna leave me down here.

26:46.229 --> 26:47.522
Oh, I most certainly am.

26:47.814 --> 26:49.691
But I will send someone back for you.

26:51.735 --> 26:52.736
Olivia, wait!

26:53.653 --> 26:55.613
This could be the last time
we see each other.

26:56.573 --> 26:57.407
Well...

26:58.825 --> 27:00.410
That is very sad, isn't it?

27:11.421 --> 27:12.756
I'm afraid your time is up.

27:15.300 --> 27:17.802
I was hoping I could make
arrangements to see my fiancée.

27:18.219 --> 27:19.220
Sure, no problem.

27:20.638 --> 27:22.223
You just tell me where Renegade is.

27:22.724 --> 27:23.683
I'll trade you.

27:26.269 --> 27:27.520
And so it goes.

27:30.148 --> 27:31.149
Let's go.

28:07.602 --> 28:08.770
Commander!

28:09.813 --> 28:10.814
Renegade's here.

28:14.234 --> 28:15.360
Step forward.

28:20.573 --> 28:21.950
You wanted Renegade?

28:22.659 --> 28:23.993
You got him.

28:48.435 --> 28:49.644
Cheeseballs.

28:52.480 --> 28:54.399
Yeah

28:58.486 --> 28:59.738
Liv?

29:00.321 --> 29:02.031
Please let me out, I'm sorry.

29:06.077 --> 29:07.537
Sorry is not gonna cut it.

29:12.709 --> 29:14.127
Thought I smelled a rat down here.

29:16.212 --> 29:17.756
Look at Major Lillywhite now.

29:18.047 --> 29:19.966
They put you in here for ass

29:21.676 --> 29:23.344
First time seeing rotters in the flesh.

29:25.096 --> 29:26.723
Less drool than in the movies.

29:30.643 --> 29:31.686
Give me those tubes.

29:33.980 --> 29:34.981
I'd rather not.

29:35.690 --> 29:37.484
You remember Monty Hall?

29:38.651 --> 29:39.652
<i>Let's Make a Deal?</i>

29:39.903 --> 29:42.363
You know, I don't believe
I've ever missed an episode.

29:42.572 --> 29:44.532
Then you know how this works.
I've got six bullets here

29:44.616 --> 29:47.243
and you can buy my bullets
for one brain tube each.

29:47.494 --> 29:49.537
And that'll be one less bullet
I put in you.

29:49.662 --> 29:51.873
Young man, if I'm going to die,

29:51.956 --> 29:53.708
I'd rather die knowing you starved.

29:53.875 --> 29:55.251
Who said anything about you dying?

29:57.045 --> 29:58.755
Got five more to go, pretty boy.

30:00.381 --> 30:01.424
What's that, laddie?

30:01.591 --> 30:02.842
You wanna play, too?

30:04.886 --> 30:06.179
Give me the tubes, Major.

30:18.650 --> 30:20.151
Sorry about your husband, dear.

30:21.236 --> 30:24.531
Look, you want my keys,
they're yours, all right?

30:24.948 --> 30:26.241
Just let me out.

30:28.368 --> 30:31.663
"Fix my drinks, do my dishes, rescue me."

30:31.955 --> 30:34.082
Try taking care of yourself
for once, darling.

30:36.125 --> 30:36.960
Olivia.

30:38.545 --> 30:39.629
No.

30:43.258 --> 30:44.884
Any word from Liv?

30:46.553 --> 30:49.180
I'm, uh, distracting myself
with a little experiment.

30:50.348 --> 30:52.183
Oh, good, I'm getting a full Ravi.

30:53.017 --> 30:55.812
I ate a brain tube as soon as that kid
confessed to the murder.

30:56.437 --> 31:00.108
Then deleted a couple of hundred photos
from my Instagram account.

31:00.984 --> 31:02.151
-Good call.
-Yeah.

31:03.444 --> 31:04.445
What's this?

31:04.779 --> 31:07.198
Not what's this, who's this?

31:08.074 --> 31:10.076
This here is nobody.

31:10.243 --> 31:11.160
A control brain.

31:11.369 --> 31:12.328
But this,

31:12.954 --> 31:13.997
this is White Girl's brain.

31:14.581 --> 31:15.748
When she was cured,

31:16.165 --> 31:18.293
dormant cells in her brain
were revitalized,

31:18.418 --> 31:20.837
thanks to glycoproteins produced

31:21.296 --> 31:22.755
by reinvigorated antigens.

31:23.006 --> 31:23.840
Uh-huh.

31:24.007 --> 31:27.343
And this brain belongs to Isobel.

31:28.177 --> 31:32.724
The only person we found who is completely
immune to the zombie virus.

31:33.224 --> 31:34.517
Someone is immune?

31:34.851 --> 31:36.769
It's a story for another day.

31:37.312 --> 31:39.355
My theory is that Isobel's unique brain,

31:39.480 --> 31:41.858
given a little motivation
from an electrical current,

31:42.066 --> 31:44.903
may just secrete traces of glycoproteins

31:44.986 --> 31:47.614
identical to those produced
by the cured brain.

31:47.780 --> 31:48.740
Meaning?

31:48.823 --> 31:51.826
Well, I'd be able to extract
some of that chemical

31:51.951 --> 31:54.412
and could potentially
manufacture a vaccine.

31:54.495 --> 31:57.165
Huh. Well, keep me posted on Liv.

31:58.124 --> 32:01.377
And your experiment.
I'm meeting Michelle for dinner.

32:02.420 --> 32:04.714
Uh, you're gonna miss the best part.

32:23.399 --> 32:24.692
What's this?

32:38.081 --> 32:39.540
Hey, can I make a suggestion?

32:40.792 --> 32:41.793
Yeah.

32:41.918 --> 32:43.503
Meet your girlfriend
somewhere where you're not

32:43.586 --> 32:45.213
rubbing Dale's nose in it.

32:49.509 --> 32:51.010
You know, Dale's seeing someone, too.

32:51.386 --> 32:53.221
And not that it's your business,

32:53.680 --> 32:55.223
but she was the one who broke things off.

32:55.723 --> 32:57.392
No. She did it for you, man.

32:58.142 --> 33:00.186
She saw the tape, your dash cam...

33:00.478 --> 33:02.397
The one where Liv was
beating that perp with the fish?

33:02.772 --> 33:05.525
She heard you talking about
how much you wanted children. She wanted you to get what you wanted.

33:08.987 --> 33:11.489
She loved you, so she set you free.

33:11.739 --> 33:12.782
So, don't be a dick to her.

33:13.324 --> 33:15.284
Quit rubbing this in her face.

33:32.427 --> 33:34.095
Liv! What are you doing--

33:34.220 --> 33:36.014
A Fillmore Graves soldier
is locked in the basement

33:36.097 --> 33:38.057
of a farm house in Cottage Grove, Oregon.

33:38.516 --> 33:39.684
I'll give you the address.

33:41.686 --> 33:42.687
Curtis.

33:48.067 --> 33:49.110
They let you go.

33:49.610 --> 33:50.445
Why?

33:50.528 --> 33:51.612
We figured they would execute you.

33:51.821 --> 33:52.780
They

33:52.947 --> 33:55.825
They strapped me to the guillotine
and then I heard Renegade surrendered.

33:56.534 --> 33:57.702
Then Chase let me go.

33:58.202 --> 33:59.704
But if it's not you, then...

34:01.289 --> 34:02.290
Levon...

34:11.424 --> 34:13.593
It appears my hypothesis
wasn't quite correct.

34:13.718 --> 34:16.345
Isobel's brain certainly
produced a chemical,

34:16.554 --> 34:19.474
but its makeup
is unlike that present in our cured brain.

34:20.475 --> 34:21.309
In fact,

34:22.143 --> 34:24.771
I've never seen anything
like this particular glycoprotein.

34:25.146 --> 34:26.564
But an antigen's an antigen.

34:26.898 --> 34:29.442
Which could mean
it will prove effective against zombieism.

34:31.360 --> 34:34.030
Phase two will involve my furry friends.

34:38.576 --> 34:42.330
Subject A, a normal rat,
will be served a dose of Isobel's brain.

34:43.206 --> 34:47.043
I will then inject
subject A with the zombie virus.

34:50.088 --> 34:52.840
To test if the ingested chemical
has rendered any signs

34:52.924 --> 34:54.050
of immunization.

34:54.133 --> 34:57.887
Subject B, a zombie rat, will serve
as my single subject control.

34:59.889 --> 35:01.349
Cross your claws, little ones.

35:01.766 --> 35:03.142
Let's do Isobel proud.

35:06.646 --> 35:07.480
Ah!

35:08.231 --> 35:09.982
From rapture to serenity.

35:10.858 --> 35:12.235
Infinity and beyond.

35:14.362 --> 35:15.488
Have to ask, Dad,

35:15.905 --> 35:18.324
you've given any more thought
to sending them out of Seattle?

35:19.242 --> 35:21.285
Think of them
as missionaries converting humans

35:21.369 --> 35:22.411
to zombieism.

35:22.495 --> 35:24.372
I asked for a sign, son.

35:24.705 --> 35:25.915
As I said I would.

35:26.666 --> 35:29.961
He will make it clear and undeniable.

35:32.046 --> 35:35.883
I confess I sometimes heard his voice
more clearly in the well.

35:36.342 --> 35:37.176
Ah.

35:41.472 --> 35:42.473
Is that...

35:53.568 --> 35:56.737
It's snowing brains.

36:02.326 --> 36:05.037
You're right, it is.

36:06.122 --> 36:09.125
Now, that my son, is a sign.

36:11.002 --> 36:12.170
I hear you, Lord!

36:13.504 --> 36:14.589
I hear you!

36:15.047 --> 36:17.008
And I obey!

36:19.844 --> 36:21.679
Hallelujah!

36:28.019 --> 36:29.562
Yo, why are we doing this?

36:30.688 --> 36:32.440
Because boss man down there

36:33.191 --> 36:35.359
is a frigging genius, that's why.

36:50.917 --> 36:51.959
I'm late for drinks.

36:53.002 --> 36:55.004
Yeah, you'll be missing those.

36:55.713 --> 36:56.797
I love you.

37:07.099 --> 37:09.685
And a good day to you, sir.

37:11.312 --> 37:13.606
I'm willing to be a zombie to be with you.

37:15.191 --> 37:16.317
I'm willing to do anything.

37:16.525 --> 37:17.652
Clive, stop.

37:17.818 --> 37:20.279
I know you heard what I said
about wanting kids.

37:21.447 --> 37:23.241
I understand why you broke up with me.

37:24.367 --> 37:25.409
And I love you for it.

37:27.203 --> 37:30.164
But I've realized now that
the most important thing to me,

37:30.498 --> 37:31.749
what I want the most,

37:33.626 --> 37:34.669
is to be with you.

37:36.170 --> 37:37.546
So, now you don't want kids?

37:37.838 --> 37:38.756
I want you more.

37:40.800 --> 37:42.760
You are the non-negotiable.

37:44.637 --> 37:47.014
There's no version of life without you

37:48.808 --> 37:49.850
that I want.

38:02.113 --> 38:03.447
Will you marry me?

38:05.116 --> 38:06.117
Yes.

38:08.077 --> 38:09.537
Yeah.

38:23.884 --> 38:26.304
I told her you were busy, sir,
but she insisted.

38:26.554 --> 38:27.722
Liv Moore,

38:28.306 --> 38:29.724
the pleasure as always is mine.

38:30.766 --> 38:31.767
What can I do for you?

38:31.934 --> 38:32.852
I'm here to surrender.

38:33.019 --> 38:34.687
You did that once and seemed to regret it.

38:35.604 --> 38:36.689
I am Renegade.

38:39.817 --> 38:41.777
Easy, Spartacus,
we've already got the guy.

38:41.986 --> 38:43.487
I run the operation.

38:44.030 --> 38:46.198
I'm the only one who scratched any humans.

38:50.661 --> 38:51.620
<i> Yes, Commander Graves?</i>

38:51.704 --> 38:53.831
Have our friend
Mr. Patch brought in from holding.

38:54.123 --> 38:55.291
<i>Right away, sir.</i>

38:56.000 --> 38:57.209
Do you need me to prove it to you?

38:57.376 --> 38:59.170
Hoover. Spano. Kelban.

38:59.337 --> 39:01.589
Those are soldiers stationed
in your border patrol

39:01.672 --> 39:03.257
who are all on the take.

39:03.841 --> 39:06.135
You could've gotten those names
from your good pal, Lillywhite. What about the shipyard heist?
That was me.

39:09.221 --> 39:11.974
I scratched Curtis Lim
in your safe-house on Astor...

39:12.099 --> 39:13.684
Do I need to keep going?

39:20.608 --> 39:22.276
If what you're saying is true,

39:24.987 --> 39:27.698
you're guilty of increasing
the zombie population

39:28.574 --> 39:30.826
and putting countless lives in jeopardy.

39:33.204 --> 39:35.998
Liv. No, don't listen to her.

39:36.499 --> 39:38.751
I'm Renegade,
she is just trying to protect me.

39:41.420 --> 39:43.130
I promised to make a trade

39:44.006 --> 39:45.299
upon Renegade's surrender.

39:47.385 --> 39:48.427
Looks like I've got her.

39:51.055 --> 39:52.223
He's free to go.

39:58.646 --> 40:01.273
Please, don't execute her.

40:01.857 --> 40:04.235
Put her in a freezer, please.

40:05.403 --> 40:06.320
I love her.

40:08.072 --> 40:10.908
Don't kill her, kill me instead.
I'm begging you.

40:11.659 --> 40:12.493
You two are alike.

40:12.576 --> 40:15.371
You're both doing what you think is right
for zombies. Don't kill her for that.

40:15.538 --> 40:16.872
Levon.

40:19.834 --> 40:21.210
Don't move!

40:21.293 --> 40:23.212
Come near me, I will blow his head off.

40:23.337 --> 40:24.296
What are you doing?

40:24.755 --> 40:25.881
Getting us out of here, come on.

40:26.090 --> 40:27.550
You won't make it through the lobby.

40:28.217 --> 40:29.718
Come on, hey!

40:33.097 --> 40:35.391
See, not even out of the office.

40:36.934 --> 40:40.020
Love is a many-splendored thing.

40:40.855 --> 40:42.857
Now you two can be executed together.

40:44.358 --> 40:45.776
You'll be Ms. Moore's opening act.

40:49.196 --> 40:50.906
Yeah, it's late.

40:51.740 --> 40:53.284
And I'm still here.

40:54.368 --> 40:58.205
All my loved ones have abandoned me
and all I have is you.

41:00.875 --> 41:02.126
Dear God.

41:08.591 --> 41:11.927
The single subject control
is no longer a zombie rat.

41:12.052 --> 41:16.015
It appears the antigen produced by
Isobel's brain isn't a vaccine.
