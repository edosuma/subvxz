01:06.790 --> 01:10.343
- Our planet is
galaxies away from Earth.

01:12.470 --> 01:14.193
We were a world of peace.

01:16.210 --> 01:18.353
Surrounded by galactical planets.

01:20.210 --> 01:21.723
With one sole mission.

01:22.590 --> 01:24.463
To build great new worlds.

01:36.330 --> 01:38.979
But after sending one of our probes

01:38.980 --> 01:41.033
to a new planet similar to Earth.

01:44.251 --> 01:46.809
Warning, airlock opening.

01:46.810 --> 01:48.893
Warning, airlock opening.

01:50.580 --> 01:52.663
Warning, airlock opening.

01:58.510 --> 02:00.249
- We encountered something

02:00.250 --> 02:02.209
that would change our way of living.

02:02.210 --> 02:04.483
An evil alien called Demonia.

02:05.420 --> 02:08.008
- Intruder alert, enemy.

02:08.009 --> 02:10.913
- He forced
us into wars and chaos.

02:19.280 --> 02:23.149
By his mind control over
us, he possessed our bodies.

02:23.150 --> 02:24.663
We turned against each other.

02:29.290 --> 02:31.079
Our God, which you humans call

02:31.080 --> 02:33.973
President, assembled a new world order.

02:37.170 --> 02:39.389
We were trained by our elders who

02:39.390 --> 02:42.129
possess great powers and taught us

02:42.130 --> 02:44.089
the way of enlightenment and how

02:44.090 --> 02:46.599
to use our abilities for good.

02:46.600 --> 02:49.963
We grew strong and
wiped out the dark lord.

02:52.080 --> 02:55.019
But his spirit was strong
and he took one of our

02:55.020 --> 02:59.749
greatest warriors and he
turned him against us.

02:59.750 --> 03:01.419
By possessing his body.

03:01.420 --> 03:04.099
We imprisoned him, but once again

03:04.100 --> 03:06.207
he used his powers to escape.

05:09.830 --> 05:13.579
Light years away was
a new colonized planet

05:13.580 --> 05:17.439
with a population of 5.5 million citizens.

05:17.440 --> 05:19.699
They were not aware that Tanash,

05:19.700 --> 05:22.087
an escaped convict, was nearby.

06:25.670 --> 06:27.599
The children were the most important

06:27.600 --> 06:30.729
part of this planet to
survive, so they were

06:30.730 --> 06:33.614
educated with the latest
technology and customs

06:33.615 --> 06:37.647
to someday leave Zealous
to a better future.

07:06.822 --> 07:08.449
- Intruder alert!

07:08.450 --> 07:09.974
Intruder alert!

07:09.975 --> 07:11.841
Unleash the Cavaliers!

07:11.842 --> 07:13.675
Unleash the Cavaliers!

08:17.260 --> 08:20.083
- Tanash's evil
plan started once again.

08:21.090 --> 08:23.769
With no disregard for life itself.

08:57.780 --> 08:59.339
- Emergency, alert!

08:59.340 --> 09:00.939
To all federative planets,

09:00.940 --> 09:04.809
this is space station Z-0103.

09:04.810 --> 09:07.268
The planet Zealous is under attack.

09:08.930 --> 09:11.282
- Yes, my name is Tanash,

09:11.283 --> 09:13.949
and I have destroyed your planet.

09:13.950 --> 09:16.684
And now I'm going to destroy you.

09:23.930 --> 09:25.689
- Attention
all federative planets.

09:25.690 --> 09:27.929
Shields up, red alert, we're under attack.

09:27.930 --> 09:29.049
We need assistance!

09:29.050 --> 09:30.639
I don't know how long we can hold out.

09:30.640 --> 09:32.139
We desperately need your help.

09:32.140 --> 09:33.090
Do you copy?

09:33.090 --> 09:33.923
Emergency!

09:33.924 --> 09:35.733
There's a meltdown in the engine core.

09:42.010 --> 09:43.459
This is your Captain.

09:43.460 --> 09:45.289
Shields are down.

09:45.290 --> 09:47.409
I'm sorry, we tried.

09:47.410 --> 09:48.789
Evacuate immediately.

09:48.790 --> 09:50.489
- You did your best, Captain.

09:50.490 --> 09:51.547
Oh my god.

10:02.403 --> 10:06.574
Evacuation sequence activated.

10:06.575 --> 10:09.008
Evacuation sequence activated.

10:10.999 --> 10:13.499
Evacuation sequence activated.

10:15.017 --> 10:17.517
Evacuation sequence activated.

10:46.354 --> 10:50.604
- Commander, I sense Tanash
is on his way to Earth.

11:10.660 --> 11:12.439
- So this is what I heard.

11:12.440 --> 11:14.249
It seems Tanash used his powers to

11:14.250 --> 11:17.129
persuade the guards to
let him out and took

11:17.130 --> 11:20.329
one of the warships and
blasted his way out.

11:20.330 --> 11:22.299
I feel sorry for those guards.

11:22.300 --> 11:23.583
They never had a chance.

11:24.560 --> 11:28.099
- Why don't they just kill
him and get it over with?

11:28.100 --> 11:30.068
Too many lost lives for nothing.

11:30.069 --> 11:31.531
- It's not that easy.

11:31.532 --> 11:34.615
His spirit would find another vessel.

11:36.316 --> 11:38.060
- Voltrix alert!

11:38.061 --> 11:39.539
- Staleth, wake up!

11:39.540 --> 11:40.653
This is priority one.

11:45.004 --> 11:46.649
- Voltrix alert!

11:46.650 --> 11:49.203
- Staleth, I need to speak to you now!

11:53.290 --> 11:54.749
- What is it, sir?

11:54.750 --> 11:57.983
- Tanash has destroyed Zealous
and all its inhabitants.

11:58.820 --> 11:59.820
- What?

12:01.470 --> 12:03.049
That can't be.

12:03.050 --> 12:04.400
I thought he was locked up.

12:05.260 --> 12:09.319
- He was, but you know he
has great powers and lured

12:09.320 --> 12:12.093
one of the guards to the
dark side and escaped.

12:15.150 --> 12:16.719
- What are my orders, sir?

12:16.720 --> 12:18.219
- He's plot a course to Earth

12:18.220 --> 12:20.779
and we want you to eliminate him.

12:20.780 --> 12:22.309
- What?

12:22.310 --> 12:23.853
That's not our law, sir.

12:25.460 --> 12:27.819
- We understand this is not our way,

12:27.820 --> 12:29.289
but the council has overturned the

12:29.290 --> 12:32.699
law because he cannot be controlled.

12:32.700 --> 12:34.179
I'm sorry.

12:34.180 --> 12:35.580
I know you grew up with him.

12:37.760 --> 12:39.894
- That was a long time ago sir,

12:39.895 --> 12:42.629
and I understand he's a threat.

12:42.630 --> 12:45.163
And he must be terminated.

12:46.440 --> 12:47.729
- Good.

12:47.730 --> 12:49.829
You are assigned to Colinus.

12:49.830 --> 12:52.129
He will help you take down Tanash.

12:52.130 --> 12:53.493
Be safe, Staleth.

13:03.950 --> 13:07.133
- Earth, I'm gonna have so
much fun with these humans.

13:37.820 --> 13:39.529
- I knew this was gonna

13:39.530 --> 13:41.939
be one of my toughest jobs, but I

13:41.940 --> 13:44.453
was trained and chosen by my god.

13:46.430 --> 13:49.559
We were like brothers, but I was the only

13:49.560 --> 13:52.843
one that had the abilities
to take him down.

13:55.550 --> 13:58.013
- Please
login the information requested.

13:58.880 --> 13:59.983
What is your password?

14:04.230 --> 14:05.903
Your password has been accepted.

14:15.575 --> 14:16.763
- Delisa.

14:17.610 --> 14:19.003
So you're my co-pilot.

14:19.890 --> 14:21.540
I feel safer already.

14:29.093 --> 14:30.093
- Staleth.

14:31.460 --> 14:32.460
Get serious.

14:33.500 --> 14:34.500
Why didn't you tell you were going

14:34.501 --> 14:35.850
to Earth to capture Tanash?

14:36.840 --> 14:39.023
You know how dangerous he is.

14:40.819 --> 14:45.819
Look, I just don't want
anything to happen to you.

14:46.520 --> 14:48.679
- This is why I didn't tell you.

14:48.680 --> 14:50.419
Because I knew you would worry.

14:50.420 --> 14:52.369
And you'll try to stop me.

14:52.370 --> 14:53.969
Honestly, I'm the only one who knows

14:53.970 --> 14:56.469
him better than anyone else out there.

14:56.470 --> 14:57.873
He must be stopped.

14:59.180 --> 15:00.709
- That's the problem.

15:00.710 --> 15:03.460
You may not be able to kill
him when you encounter him.

15:04.748 --> 15:07.563
And I don't wanna lose you.

15:07.564 --> 15:09.231
I love you, Staleth.

15:10.510 --> 15:11.510
- Don't worry.

15:12.400 --> 15:15.273
All the memories from the
past are long forgotten.

15:16.657 --> 15:18.053
He is a criminal.

15:19.180 --> 15:21.763
And he must be stopped.

15:33.020 --> 15:36.173
- Hey mom, I'm sorry, just
came to visit you today.

15:37.800 --> 15:40.750
I'm sorry, it's been a
while since I seen you.

15:47.710 --> 15:49.489
Yeah mom, I know I had a little too

15:49.490 --> 15:51.908
much to drink, but you want some?

15:51.909 --> 15:54.369
I can pour a glass for you.

15:54.370 --> 15:56.019
Mom, I got some great news.

15:56.020 --> 15:57.020
I got a job.

15:58.320 --> 16:00.019
As a stand-up comedian.

16:00.020 --> 16:02.529
Imagine that, me as a stand-up comedian.

16:02.530 --> 16:04.830
But I wanted you to
listen to one of my jokes.

16:05.800 --> 16:07.399
This man dies and finds himself

16:07.400 --> 16:09.449
in Hell, and wallowing in his despair,

16:09.450 --> 16:11.239
the first person he meets is a demon.

16:11.240 --> 16:13.099
The demon says why are you so glum?

16:13.100 --> 16:15.209
And I said look where I am, I'm in Hell!

16:15.210 --> 16:16.599
The demon says it's not so bad

16:16.600 --> 16:18.049
down here, we have a lot of fun.

16:18.050 --> 16:20.019
Demon says you look like a drinker.

16:20.020 --> 16:22.869
The demon says Monday
night is drinking night,

16:22.870 --> 16:25.982
we drink all the whiskey,
tequila, vodka you want.

16:25.983 --> 16:28.299
'Till you puke, then you can drink more.

16:28.300 --> 16:30.299
The guy says that sounds pretty good.

16:30.300 --> 16:31.889
He says you like to smoke?

16:31.890 --> 16:33.799
The guys says yeah, demon says well

16:33.800 --> 16:35.519
Tuesday's smoking night, you get to smoke

16:35.520 --> 16:37.779
all the cigarettes and
all the cigars you want.

16:37.780 --> 16:39.769
Smoke your lungs out 'till you get

16:39.770 --> 16:42.053
cancer because you're already dead.

16:43.340 --> 16:44.849
The guy goes this ain't a bad deal

16:44.850 --> 16:46.803
at all, sounds pretty fun down here.

16:48.100 --> 16:49.779
Then the demon says are you a gambler?

16:49.780 --> 16:51.569
Guys says I love to gamble.

16:51.570 --> 16:55.689
We got blackjack, horse
races, slot machines.

16:55.690 --> 16:58.443
You can gamble a house away
'cause you got nothing to lose.

16:59.330 --> 17:02.989
The guy's like wow, this
is looking good after all.

17:02.990 --> 17:05.579
So the demon goes you do drugs?

17:05.579 --> 17:07.180
The guy says yeah, I love drugs.

17:08.180 --> 17:10.269
He goes Thursday night is drug night,

17:10.270 --> 17:13.499
we have marijuana, pills, cocaine,

17:13.500 --> 17:17.051
heroin, you can do all
you want 'till you OD.

17:17.053 --> 17:18.502
Because you're already dead.

17:19.339 --> 17:21.598
Mom, you're gonna love
this, the punchline.

17:21.599 --> 17:24.449
The demon asks the guy are you gay?

17:24.450 --> 17:26.868
The guy's like no, I'm not gay.

17:26.869 --> 17:28.249
'Cause well, I don't think you're

17:28.250 --> 17:30.559
gonna like Fridays too much.

17:30.560 --> 17:32.080
Up the ass.

17:32.915 --> 17:34.133
Don't you find that funny, ma?

17:35.090 --> 17:37.253
Well here's to me and you, ma.

17:39.520 --> 17:41.533
My new career as a stand-up comedian.

17:43.850 --> 17:44.850
Cheers.

17:48.582 --> 17:51.016
I'm gonna be all right, mom.

17:52.200 --> 17:53.919
- I loved it.

17:53.920 --> 17:56.169
- Hey I don't want no trouble, man.

17:56.170 --> 17:57.799
- Too late for that.

17:57.800 --> 18:00.753
Look into my eyes, what do you see?

18:01.800 --> 18:03.859
What do you see?

18:03.860 --> 18:05.569
What do you see?

18:05.570 --> 18:06.939
What do you see?

18:06.940 --> 18:09.519
What do you see?

18:13.694 --> 18:15.027
What do you see?

18:16.658 --> 18:17.991
What do you see?

18:20.839 --> 18:22.664
What do you see?

18:45.550 --> 18:48.496
- So who's going
to help you fight Tanash?

18:48.497 --> 18:52.813
Are you going in like a lone
warrior with no backup again?

18:54.420 --> 18:55.752
- See, that's funny.

18:55.753 --> 18:56.799
Of course not.

18:56.800 --> 18:58.259
I'm meeting up with Colinus.

18:58.260 --> 18:59.260
What's our status?

19:04.920 --> 19:07.389
- All instruments check, Captain.

19:07.390 --> 19:08.799
We are a go.

19:08.800 --> 19:11.669
- This is V-929 on Pad Seven.

19:11.670 --> 19:12.797
Ready to launch.

19:14.331 --> 19:15.498
Remove clamps.

19:25.736 --> 19:27.069
- Zone unlocked.

20:21.820 --> 20:23.046
- Staleth?

20:23.047 --> 20:25.469
Why don't you let me come with you?

20:25.470 --> 20:28.419
- Come on, we've gone
over this so many times.

20:28.420 --> 20:31.299
Because I don't want
anything to happen to you.

20:31.300 --> 20:32.300
- I understand.

20:34.060 --> 20:35.643
Please be careful.

20:36.610 --> 20:38.610
I don't know what I'll do if I lose you.

20:40.720 --> 20:44.049
- Come on, don't you have any faith in me?

20:44.050 --> 20:45.809
I know Tanash.

20:45.810 --> 20:48.299
I know him better than
anyone else out there.

20:48.300 --> 20:52.453
He thinks he's invincible,
and that will be his downfall.

20:55.390 --> 20:56.983
- I do have faith in you.

20:58.310 --> 20:59.343
- Okay, we're here.

21:00.400 --> 21:03.513
This is a little something
so you don't forget about me.

21:10.720 --> 21:12.939
I didn't know if I was ever gonna see her,

21:12.940 --> 21:15.079
and I hope she understood that

21:15.080 --> 21:16.580
I couldn't afford to lose her.

21:24.070 --> 21:26.769
As I beamed into the mothership, I knew

21:26.770 --> 21:28.470
this mission wasn't gonna be easy.

21:34.160 --> 21:37.009
On my way to a launchpad
to Earth, I thought

21:37.010 --> 21:38.386
of all the great memories me and

21:38.387 --> 21:39.993
Tanash had growing up together.

21:44.840 --> 21:47.503
Both of us were gonna help
build great new worlds.

21:50.330 --> 21:51.493
We were like brothers.

21:54.040 --> 21:57.623
And now it was my job to take him down.

21:59.910 --> 22:01.729
This wasn't gonna be easy, but I

22:01.730 --> 22:03.763
knew there was no way to save him now.

22:27.730 --> 22:30.703
My destiny was chosen by the gods.

22:37.210 --> 22:38.403
I had two choices.

22:39.730 --> 22:40.730
To kill him...

22:42.750 --> 22:43.750
Or let him be.

23:14.860 --> 23:16.439
Colinus, how have you been?

23:16.440 --> 23:18.139
- Good, my friend.

23:18.140 --> 23:19.329
- Is everything ready?

23:19.330 --> 23:21.573
- Have I ever let you down, Staleth?

23:22.890 --> 23:24.140
I got everything we need.

23:30.370 --> 23:31.970
- You outdid yourself this time.

23:44.930 --> 23:46.833
- So I heard this is priority red.

23:47.920 --> 23:49.199
- Yes.

23:49.200 --> 23:51.349
This bounty's not like any other.

23:51.350 --> 23:53.149
His name is Tanash.

23:53.150 --> 23:54.600
They call him The Undertaker.

23:55.520 --> 23:56.729
He's killed more species in the

23:56.730 --> 23:58.830
galaxy than anyone we've ever encountered.

23:59.670 --> 24:02.059
- So we bring him back to be judged.

24:02.060 --> 24:03.239
- No.

24:03.240 --> 24:05.069
Not this one, he's a threat.

24:05.070 --> 24:08.369
He must be exterminated here on Earth.

24:08.370 --> 24:10.120
- Have you got a vision on him yet?

24:14.500 --> 24:15.559
- Yes.

24:15.560 --> 24:16.929
Evergreen Cemetery.

24:16.930 --> 24:18.780
Just head east, it's not so far away.

24:40.320 --> 24:42.969
- Hey man, did you catch
that game last night?

24:42.970 --> 24:44.949
How awesome was that?

24:44.950 --> 24:46.133
- Yeah man, great game.

24:53.960 --> 24:56.919
- Hey, any of you guys
got a phone I can borrow?

24:56.920 --> 24:59.499
My car broke down about
a mile up the road.

24:59.500 --> 25:01.400
- Yeah man, you can use my phone, man.

25:03.970 --> 25:06.149
- Hey, what planet am I on?

25:06.150 --> 25:07.176
- What's going on over here?

25:07.177 --> 25:08.449
You on drugs or something?

25:08.450 --> 25:09.450
You're on Earth.

25:11.520 --> 25:13.719
- Oh, you guys are humans.

25:13.720 --> 25:15.756
- Get this guy out of here,
he's on crack or something.

25:15.757 --> 25:17.642
- He's crazy.

25:17.643 --> 25:19.339
- What is that over there?

25:19.340 --> 25:20.340
- That's my bat.

25:21.910 --> 25:23.313
- Looks kinda primitive.

25:26.728 --> 25:28.169
- Hey what the fuck are you doing?

25:28.170 --> 25:31.007
- Hey man, put my bat down
before I kick your fucking ass.

25:33.585 --> 25:34.935
- Chill out man, chill out.

25:38.412 --> 25:39.872
- I can't fucking move.

25:39.873 --> 25:40.773
I can't fucking move.

25:40.774 --> 25:42.769
- I can't move, what's he doing?

25:42.770 --> 25:44.290
- I can't move!

25:44.291 --> 25:45.380
- We gotta get out of here.

25:45.381 --> 25:47.492
We gotta get out of here!

25:47.493 --> 25:50.843
- What are you doing man, come on!

25:50.844 --> 25:53.177
- Fuck man, come on man, no!

25:54.821 --> 25:56.765
- Don't do this, man!

26:24.685 --> 26:28.769
- Arriving at the cemetery, I
knew we were already too late.

26:28.770 --> 26:31.239
Seems we were one step behind him,

26:31.240 --> 26:32.763
and I felt the dark spirit.

27:07.590 --> 27:09.087
I sense his presence.

27:26.520 --> 27:27.790
He landed right here.

27:41.232 --> 27:43.899
- What are you feeling, Staleth?

27:47.045 --> 27:48.545
- There was a man.

27:50.740 --> 27:52.313
He was about 45 years old.

28:03.253 --> 28:05.336
That was his first toast.

28:12.774 --> 28:15.357
- Do you know where he's going?

28:18.610 --> 28:19.610
- Yes.

28:26.300 --> 28:27.633
I feel something tragic.

28:29.324 --> 28:32.107
He killed three young men.

28:35.019 --> 28:36.186
In that house.

28:39.137 --> 28:41.720
Blows to the head and the back.

28:49.508 --> 28:51.103
He knows we're onto him.

28:52.251 --> 28:53.301
We need to move fast.

29:12.922 --> 29:15.349
- So tell me the truth.

29:15.350 --> 29:17.059
How can he read us?

29:17.060 --> 29:19.889
You know more than what you're telling me.

29:19.890 --> 29:21.140
- I could never fool you.

29:22.650 --> 29:26.229
15 years ago me and Tanash
entered the academy together.

29:26.230 --> 29:29.669
Me and Tanash trained
like warriors because

29:29.670 --> 29:32.363
we were set to become great kings.

29:34.070 --> 29:35.030
But there was something different

29:35.031 --> 29:36.930
about Tanash right from the beginning.

29:39.420 --> 29:42.523
But I placed my soul and
my spirit within myself.

29:46.600 --> 29:47.743
But Tanash never did.

29:49.830 --> 29:51.053
That was his weakness.

29:52.260 --> 29:53.959
He was arrogant.

29:53.960 --> 29:56.319
Nothing was ever good for him.

29:56.320 --> 29:57.729
I think that's the reason why the

29:57.730 --> 30:00.177
dark lord easily possessed him.

30:16.050 --> 30:18.029
I remember as our god was escorted

30:18.030 --> 30:21.569
by our mighty warriors, the laws of

30:21.570 --> 30:24.549
our forefathers and
protectors of this universe

30:24.550 --> 30:27.793
were our mantle to carry
into a new century.

31:16.429 --> 31:17.429
- Halt!

31:21.161 --> 31:24.529
Tanash, Staleth, you are
both ready to receive my

31:24.530 --> 31:27.213
powers and do great
things in this universe.

31:28.680 --> 31:31.469
But first, you must keep your hearts pure.

31:31.470 --> 31:32.979
Do you understand?

31:32.980 --> 31:34.379
- Yes master.
- Yes master.

31:34.380 --> 31:36.446
- Otherwise, great evil will come upon you

31:36.447 --> 31:38.493
and you will slip over to the dark side.

31:48.434 --> 31:50.934
- We were given unique powers.

31:51.960 --> 31:55.769
But he was obsessed and
turned to the evil within him.

31:55.770 --> 31:58.420
- What are the powers that
he has that I should know?

31:59.360 --> 32:01.079
- He can possess your body.

32:01.080 --> 32:03.453
He holds electrical
powers within his spirit.

32:04.480 --> 32:06.593
- Great, so basically he's indestructible.

32:07.640 --> 32:10.303
- Not if we kill him
while he's in the host.

32:53.647 --> 32:56.116
♪ This old man, he came home ♪

32:56.117 --> 32:59.509
♪ He played knick-knack on my bone ♪

32:59.510 --> 33:02.012
♪ Knick-knack paddywhack,
give a dog a bone ♪

33:02.013 --> 33:06.096
♪ This old man keeps coming home ♪

33:09.150 --> 33:12.993
- Great time for this piece
of shit car to break down!

33:14.480 --> 33:16.523
- Calm down Betty, it's not so bad.

33:19.930 --> 33:21.865
- What are you talking about?

33:21.866 --> 33:23.328
Hmm?

33:23.329 --> 33:25.109
We're fucked.

33:25.110 --> 33:26.793
We already lost money in this.

33:28.290 --> 33:30.240
How the fuck are we gonna pay the rent?

33:31.860 --> 33:33.409
- Let me call someone for help.

33:33.410 --> 33:34.510
We'll make it on time.

33:38.850 --> 33:40.953
I'm sorry, I can't get any signal.

33:42.210 --> 33:43.383
Can you try your phone?

33:49.470 --> 33:51.141
- Me neither.

33:58.848 --> 34:00.643
- Oh, someone's coming.

34:05.400 --> 34:08.310
- Hey, seems like you
girls need some help.

34:09.820 --> 34:12.623
- Oh yes sir, thank you for stopping.

34:13.742 --> 34:16.299
- So what seems to be the problem?

34:16.300 --> 34:18.329
- The car just turned off.

34:18.330 --> 34:19.679
- Maybe you need a jump, I'll see

34:19.679 --> 34:21.303
if I have some jumper cables.

34:30.670 --> 34:32.583
All right, try to crank it now.

34:37.230 --> 34:38.230
- Shit!

34:41.811 --> 34:42.643
- Nothing?

34:42.645 --> 34:44.168
You didn't get anything?

34:44.170 --> 34:45.222
Now?

34:46.449 --> 34:47.449
- Fuck!

34:48.810 --> 34:50.509
- Hey, I'm sorry to say, but your

34:50.510 --> 34:52.369
battery and alternator's dead.

34:52.370 --> 34:54.449
I can give you a ride to
the closest gas station,

34:54.449 --> 34:56.833
and then I can get you home
from there if you like.

35:00.230 --> 35:01.549
- We can't ask you to do that.

35:01.550 --> 35:03.389
- Of course we can.

35:03.390 --> 35:05.409
He's gonna save our ass.

35:05.410 --> 35:07.210
- So where are you girls heading to?

35:08.170 --> 35:10.089
- We have a modeling gig.

35:10.090 --> 35:11.183
- And we're fucked.

35:12.670 --> 35:15.470
- A lot of big words, but
it's good to express yourself.

35:16.320 --> 35:17.847
You know, you're very pretty.

35:19.535 --> 35:20.952
- Thank you, sir.

36:00.576 --> 36:02.126
- So were you and Tanash close?

36:03.160 --> 36:04.439
- Yes.

36:04.440 --> 36:05.840
He was like a brother to me.

36:06.800 --> 36:08.253
He was my best friend.

36:16.350 --> 36:18.369
- So Staleth, soon we will be able to

36:18.370 --> 36:20.853
travel the universe
together and be like gods.

36:22.833 --> 36:25.919
- Tanash, we're not gods, we're
protectors of the universe.

36:25.920 --> 36:28.389
- I know, I know, I'm just kidding.

36:28.390 --> 36:30.379
- So how's testing so far?

36:30.380 --> 36:31.809
- Pretty good, but sometimes I

36:31.810 --> 36:33.489
feel like it's a waste of time.

36:33.490 --> 36:34.783
Come on, I'll race you.

36:43.080 --> 36:44.659
- We need to move fast.

36:44.660 --> 36:46.039
He has the two girls.

36:46.040 --> 36:47.340
I'll try to reach him now.

36:55.190 --> 36:57.563
- So are you girls
pretty good at modeling?

36:58.550 --> 37:02.859
- Yeah, we're pretty good,
but it's a tough business.

37:02.860 --> 37:03.865
- Yeah.

37:04.700 --> 37:06.349
You never know what to expect.

37:06.350 --> 37:07.400
- Yeah, you're right.

37:10.080 --> 37:11.603
- Sir, can you hurry up?

37:12.520 --> 37:14.123
We really need to make this gig.

37:15.560 --> 37:17.210
- Are you giving me orders, girl?

37:18.060 --> 37:19.339
Sounds like you are.

37:19.340 --> 37:21.013
That doesn't sit right with me.

37:22.340 --> 37:25.629
- No sir, she didn't
mean anything by that.

37:25.630 --> 37:28.063
We don't know what to do, we
don't wanna lose that money.

37:28.983 --> 37:30.978
- Tanash, I was sent to stop you.

37:30.979 --> 37:31.812
- What?

37:31.813 --> 37:33.460
- You must let these two girls go.

37:35.955 --> 37:37.943
- You can never stop me, Staleth.

37:39.090 --> 37:40.340
- Who are you talking to?

37:41.490 --> 37:43.983
- Why have you turned to the dark side?

37:45.330 --> 37:47.610
- Because I don't wanna be controlled.

37:49.321 --> 37:51.149
- Sir, are you okay?

37:51.150 --> 37:52.550
- I have orders to kill you.

37:53.450 --> 37:54.950
If you don't turn yourself in.

37:55.870 --> 37:56.703
- Get out!

37:56.703 --> 37:57.703
Leave me alone now!

38:00.330 --> 38:01.879
- What?

38:01.880 --> 38:03.449
- Hey girls, I was just practicing

38:03.450 --> 38:05.659
for a play, did I scare you?

38:05.660 --> 38:07.349
I'm sorry.

38:07.350 --> 38:09.973
- Yeah, you scared the
shit out of me, okay?

38:13.630 --> 38:15.413
- Oh yeah, me too.

38:22.944 --> 38:24.611
- Did you reach him?

38:26.100 --> 38:28.749
- Yes, but he's too far gone now.

38:28.750 --> 38:30.609
We're gonna have to kill him.

38:30.610 --> 38:32.010
- Will that be hard for you?

38:34.510 --> 38:35.909
- Yes.

38:35.910 --> 38:37.468
Very hard.

38:45.369 --> 38:47.379
- This car's running pretty rough.

38:47.380 --> 38:48.780
I'm gonna have to pull over.

39:01.160 --> 39:03.879
I'm sorry, my car's broken down too now.

39:03.880 --> 39:05.129
- Fucking great.

39:05.130 --> 39:07.043
Now his car's broken down too.

39:24.740 --> 39:26.502
Come here, you little bitch!

39:37.930 --> 39:39.803
These human balls suck!

39:41.849 --> 39:44.663
Come, little baby, here I come!

39:46.212 --> 39:49.133
You can run, but you can't
hide, you stupid bitch!

39:51.670 --> 39:53.053
I see you.

40:04.576 --> 40:05.420
There you are!

40:05.421 --> 40:06.475
- No, no, no!

40:06.476 --> 40:07.729
- You missed me?

40:07.730 --> 40:08.947
- Don't kill me!

40:08.948 --> 40:09.994
No!

40:09.995 --> 40:10.877
No!

40:10.878 --> 40:12.255
No, please don't!

40:12.256 --> 40:13.188
Stop, don't kill me!

40:13.189 --> 40:15.772
- Come on, don't fight it.

40:15.773 --> 40:16.948
Stop moving.

40:16.949 --> 40:17.949
I got you.

40:41.521 --> 40:42.604
- Where am I?

40:43.661 --> 40:45.203
- Quiet or I'll kill you now.

40:47.090 --> 40:49.469
- Why are you doing this?

40:49.470 --> 40:51.264
- So stupid, this is fun.

40:53.777 --> 40:55.739
- Why are you taking me?

40:55.740 --> 40:58.177
- Ignorant human, because this is fun.

41:20.096 --> 41:21.625
- Pull over.

41:21.626 --> 41:22.675
- What's wrong?

41:22.676 --> 41:24.926
- One of the girls is here.

42:14.584 --> 42:15.584
Why?

42:21.570 --> 42:23.443
- So what did you find out?

42:24.820 --> 42:26.469
- He's pure evil.

42:26.470 --> 42:27.770
And he's getting stronger.

42:28.720 --> 42:30.809
He's trying to find a motel.

42:30.810 --> 42:32.410
To kill and rape the other girl.

42:33.250 --> 42:34.250
Just head east.

42:35.530 --> 42:36.963
I sense that he's close by.

42:52.980 --> 42:54.179
- All right, listen up.

42:54.180 --> 42:55.679
I promise not to kill you, but if you

42:55.680 --> 42:57.789
scream I'll break every bone in your body.

42:57.790 --> 42:58.813
You understand?

43:02.060 --> 43:03.060
- Yes.

43:13.510 --> 43:16.179
Please, please, please don't.

43:16.180 --> 43:17.603
No, no!

43:18.826 --> 43:19.826
Stop!

43:25.112 --> 43:27.699
- Oh you're gonna like
what I'm gonna do to you.

43:27.700 --> 43:28.629
- Stop, stop!

43:28.630 --> 43:30.204
- I'm gonna torture you.

43:30.205 --> 43:31.439
Oh man, I like this ass.

43:31.440 --> 43:32.273
- No!

43:32.274 --> 43:34.613
- You smell like candy,
I'm gonna eat you up.

43:36.300 --> 43:37.609
I'm not letting you go, I'm gonna

43:37.610 --> 43:39.789
torture you and you're
gonna actually love it.

43:39.790 --> 43:40.623
- Stop.

43:40.624 --> 43:41.949
- Oh I'm gonna enjoy this so much.

43:41.950 --> 43:42.783
- Please don't.

43:42.784 --> 43:44.555
- You dropped your
shoe, you dumbass whore.

43:44.556 --> 43:46.659
- You're hurting me!

43:46.660 --> 43:47.493
Stop!

43:47.494 --> 43:49.689
- You female species are
only good for pleasuring us.

43:49.690 --> 43:50.776
- No, stop!

43:50.777 --> 43:52.196
Stop, let go of me!

43:52.197 --> 43:54.217
- Oh you're a fighter aren't you?

43:54.218 --> 43:55.218
- Help!

43:56.130 --> 43:57.130
Let go!

44:01.720 --> 44:04.879
- Move your ass and stop
screaming, you little hoe.

44:04.880 --> 44:06.837
Daddy's gonna have some fun with you.

44:09.510 --> 44:11.729
What sick things I'm gonna do to you.

44:11.730 --> 44:13.230
Wait 'till I get you upstairs.

44:23.126 --> 44:24.829
- Stop, stop please.

44:24.830 --> 44:26.679
- You're whining like
the dog that you are.

44:26.680 --> 44:28.259
Bark, little doggie.

44:28.260 --> 44:29.649
Ruff ruff.

44:29.650 --> 44:30.520
- Somebody help!

44:30.520 --> 44:31.520
Stop!

44:35.170 --> 44:37.639
- You should be privileged
that I'm even touching you.

44:37.640 --> 44:38.843
I am a god.

44:44.183 --> 44:47.767
Little fucker, look at you
whining, you little bitch.

44:47.768 --> 44:49.054
I'm gonna love this.

44:49.055 --> 44:51.524
I'm gonna enjoy this.

44:51.525 --> 44:52.525
- No, no!

44:56.799 --> 44:58.269
No, no!

44:58.270 --> 44:59.879
- Get on the bed and stay right here.

44:59.880 --> 45:02.680
And stop your whining, you little hoe.

45:56.310 --> 45:57.669
- What's your name, sir?

45:57.670 --> 45:58.989
- Tom Walkins, sir.

45:58.990 --> 46:01.829
- So Tom, you run this hotel?

46:01.830 --> 46:03.303
- I most certainly do, sir.

46:04.280 --> 46:06.969
- There have been some
killings around here.

46:06.970 --> 46:08.549
- Well I'm not too concerned about that,

46:08.550 --> 46:10.759
I got my Winchester in the back.

46:10.760 --> 46:11.839
- You got what?

46:11.840 --> 46:14.423
- Don't worry, I got a damn permit for it.

46:15.400 --> 46:17.209
- By the way, will you mind if I knock

46:17.210 --> 46:19.460
on some doors, see if
I hear or see anything?

46:21.310 --> 46:23.419
- Nah, you go right ahead, but if anything

46:23.420 --> 46:24.729
suspicious happens around here,

46:24.730 --> 46:26.669
we usually put a bullet in it.

46:26.670 --> 46:30.159
- Whoa, hold on sir, let
us please do our job here.

46:30.160 --> 46:33.016
You know, we'll take care
of everything from here.

46:33.017 --> 46:34.706
Here's my card, call
me if you see anything.

46:34.707 --> 46:36.459
- Yes sir, I most certainly will.

46:36.460 --> 46:38.369
You sure you don't want a
cold beer before you go?

46:38.370 --> 46:40.779
I got some Miller Lite on ice.

46:40.780 --> 46:42.159
- Real funny, Tom.

46:42.160 --> 46:43.160
No thanks.

47:00.166 --> 47:00.999
- What do you want?

47:00.999 --> 47:01.832
- How you doing?

47:01.833 --> 47:02.999
I'm officer John Thomas.

47:03.000 --> 47:04.169
Can I ask you a couple questions?

47:04.170 --> 47:05.489
- Yeah, but it's my honeymoon.

47:05.490 --> 47:07.119
Me and my girl are gonna get busy.

47:07.120 --> 47:08.339
- I understand, sir.

47:08.340 --> 47:09.639
It'll just take a second.

47:09.640 --> 47:10.779
Can I come in?

47:10.780 --> 47:11.780
- All right, sir.

47:13.470 --> 47:16.249
But make it quick because
I don't have all day.

47:16.250 --> 47:19.249
Just give me a minute, let me
tell my wife you're coming in.

47:19.250 --> 47:21.169
Come on, gotta get up now, all right?

47:21.170 --> 47:22.249
Come on.

47:22.250 --> 47:23.140
Take your clothes off.

47:23.141 --> 47:24.529
Put on a towel, get in the shower,

47:24.530 --> 47:25.589
and don't make a sound, or I'm

47:25.590 --> 47:27.589
gonna fucking kill you, understand?

47:27.590 --> 47:29.990
All right, come on, let's
go now, in the shower.

47:32.350 --> 47:33.833
Come on in now, officer.

47:42.530 --> 47:44.819
- Sir, where's your wife?

47:44.820 --> 47:46.463
- She's just taking a shower.

47:55.360 --> 47:58.223
- Ma'am, this is Officer
John Thomas, are you okay?

48:05.010 --> 48:06.123
- Yes, I'm okay.

48:07.110 --> 48:08.560
- Sorry to bother you, ma'am.

48:12.980 --> 48:14.249
You have a nice day, sir.

48:14.250 --> 48:15.240
- You too, officer.

48:15.241 --> 48:16.803
I told you she'd be all right.

48:17.825 --> 48:18.727
- Help!

48:18.727 --> 48:19.727
Help!

48:31.962 --> 48:33.629
- Look into my eyes.

48:47.444 --> 48:49.885
- Thank you, officer.

48:49.886 --> 48:50.886
Thank you.

48:56.118 --> 48:57.535
- Shut up, bitch.

48:59.024 --> 49:01.691
All I wanted was a piece of ass.

49:12.846 --> 49:14.460
Stupid bitch.

49:14.461 --> 49:17.044
I told you to shut the fuck up.

49:33.243 --> 49:35.059
- So what do you want me to do?

49:35.060 --> 49:36.099
- Stay in the car.

49:36.100 --> 49:37.893
If you see him, shoot to kill.

49:38.865 --> 49:40.359
- You sure you don't
want me to back you up?

49:40.360 --> 49:41.210
- Yes.

49:41.211 --> 49:44.169
He can see a mile away, his
powers are getting stronger.

49:44.170 --> 49:45.340
- I understand.

51:00.182 --> 51:01.432
- Tanash, stop!

51:02.300 --> 51:04.229
I don't wanna kill you.

51:04.230 --> 51:05.953
Just turn yourself in.

51:07.983 --> 51:12.499
- Staleth, leave me alone or
it's gonna end badly for you.

51:12.500 --> 51:13.860
- I can't do that.

51:15.830 --> 51:16.830
- I know.

52:37.395 --> 52:41.079
- Colinus, the trooper's Tanash.

52:41.080 --> 52:42.569
He's coming your way.

52:42.570 --> 52:43.570
- I got it.

52:59.740 --> 53:01.563
Stop Tanash, there's nowhere to go.

53:02.777 --> 53:03.777
- Colinus.

53:05.500 --> 53:06.923
You're his partner now?

53:09.789 --> 53:13.308
You haven't learned anything yet.

53:16.541 --> 53:18.458
- Yes, you need to die.

54:00.036 --> 54:03.036
- Oh shit!

54:09.547 --> 54:11.349
Hey, are you okay?

54:11.350 --> 54:13.649
Sir, I'm so sorry, I didn't see you.

54:13.650 --> 54:15.453
I'm gonna call help right now.

54:17.660 --> 54:18.939
Shit, hello?

54:18.940 --> 54:20.159
Yeah.

54:20.160 --> 54:21.710
I just hit someone on the road.

54:23.320 --> 54:24.623
I'm at Oakachobee.

54:26.618 --> 54:29.119
I don't know if he's
dead, I didn't see him.

54:29.120 --> 54:30.393
He came out of nowhere.

54:31.340 --> 54:32.799
Shit, he's bleeding.

54:32.800 --> 54:33.800
I'm so sorry.

54:39.355 --> 54:42.529
- What's your name, son?

54:42.530 --> 54:43.692
- Sam.

54:43.693 --> 54:44.526
Thank god.

54:44.527 --> 54:46.992
Sam's my name, what's your name?

54:46.993 --> 54:51.993
- Tanash.

54:57.970 --> 54:59.283
- It's good to be me.

55:17.358 --> 55:18.453
- No!

55:18.454 --> 55:19.929
Colinus!

55:19.930 --> 55:22.043
I will not let you die, my friend.

55:23.320 --> 55:26.473
Master, I must speak to you!

55:28.890 --> 55:29.890
Master!

55:31.490 --> 55:32.613
Colinus is dead.

55:33.610 --> 55:34.713
- I know, my son.

55:35.850 --> 55:37.133
- I need to save him.

55:38.784 --> 55:41.799
- Staleth, you know this
is not permitted and

55:41.800 --> 55:45.303
very dangerous and can
change the outcome on Earth.

55:46.700 --> 55:47.953
- I understand, master.

55:49.030 --> 55:50.313
But he is my friend.

55:51.170 --> 55:53.853
Please give me the power to save him.

55:55.835 --> 55:57.743
- It has been given, my son.

56:04.104 --> 56:05.263
- What happened?

56:07.000 --> 56:08.350
- I almost lost you, buddy.

56:12.960 --> 56:14.373
- What did you do to me?

56:15.700 --> 56:19.321
- I asked Themus to save you.

56:19.322 --> 56:21.003
- You did what?

56:22.476 --> 56:24.739
You know you're not supposed to do that.

56:24.740 --> 56:26.769
You jeopardize the whole Earth.

56:26.770 --> 56:29.397
But I wanna thank you.

56:41.640 --> 56:43.569
Nothing personal Staleth, but it's

56:43.570 --> 56:45.220
hard to believe he was ever good.

56:46.400 --> 56:50.449
- He was, but greed and pride
is the worst temptation.

56:50.450 --> 56:52.403
It led him to believe he was a god.

56:55.460 --> 56:58.110
We need to take him down
before he kills anyone else.

56:59.450 --> 57:00.430
- Agreed.

57:00.431 --> 57:02.353
I won't be so easy next time.

57:04.786 --> 57:05.809
- There.

57:05.810 --> 57:07.459
There he is.

57:07.460 --> 57:08.743
- I'll catch up.

57:08.744 --> 57:10.744
You just make sure you kill that psycho.

57:11.860 --> 57:12.860
- I will.

57:13.820 --> 57:15.864
- Okay, I see him now.

57:19.940 --> 57:21.179
- Tanash's powers were growing

57:21.180 --> 57:24.399
stronger and he was out of control.

57:24.400 --> 57:28.249
I thought I might be able to
reach him inside his spirit.

57:28.250 --> 57:30.509
Demonia had full control of him.

57:30.510 --> 57:32.799
The dark side was strong within him.

57:32.800 --> 57:37.139
We had to stop him before he
built his forces once again.

57:37.140 --> 57:40.370
Or our world will become
like it was before.

57:53.815 --> 57:54.815
Get closer!

58:15.809 --> 58:18.726
I'll wipe that smirk off your face!

58:22.400 --> 58:25.189
Tanash knew that using our
human bodies as vessels

58:25.190 --> 58:28.639
would be easy for him to build
a bigger army than before.

58:28.640 --> 58:30.549
Humans were easily persuaded since

58:30.550 --> 58:32.313
they have yet mastered their minds.

58:33.720 --> 58:35.733
- Bring that dirtbag down!

58:40.220 --> 58:43.519
- His laser blasts
were very powerful weapons,

58:43.520 --> 58:45.739
but we used our force field to protect us.

58:45.740 --> 58:48.131
Our guns were imitation of human firearms,

58:48.132 --> 58:50.929
but they held limitless firepower with

58:50.930 --> 58:53.139
special bullets that
will take Tanash down.

59:01.622 --> 59:04.793
- Come on Staleth, put him down.

59:07.121 --> 59:09.169
We need to stop him here before he can

59:09.170 --> 59:10.957
run into the train tracks and lose him.

59:13.970 --> 59:15.070
- Get a little closer!

59:19.930 --> 59:21.379
- This is as close as I can get.

59:21.380 --> 59:22.430
- Okay, I got a shot!

01:00:11.936 --> 01:00:13.025
- Where'd he go?

01:00:13.026 --> 01:00:16.026
- I don't see him, he's not up here.

01:00:19.790 --> 01:00:20.790
You all right?

01:00:22.030 --> 01:00:22.863
- Yeah.

01:00:22.864 --> 01:00:23.983
He just barely got me.

01:00:25.638 --> 01:00:27.599
- You need to be careful.

01:00:27.600 --> 01:00:29.500
I won't be able to save you next time.

01:00:30.650 --> 01:00:31.749
- I understand.

01:00:31.750 --> 01:00:33.249
- Okay, this is the game plan.

01:00:33.250 --> 01:00:34.849
You back me up 20 yards.

01:00:34.850 --> 01:00:37.049
I can resist hits with
my body, but you can't.

01:00:37.050 --> 01:00:39.113
If he sees you coming
you're an easy target.

01:00:40.750 --> 01:00:41.879
- All right, I'll go back to the

01:00:41.880 --> 01:00:44.059
car and get some supplies and water.

01:00:44.060 --> 01:00:45.060
It's getting dark.

01:00:45.962 --> 01:00:47.519
Are you sure you're gonna be okay?

01:00:47.520 --> 01:00:48.579
- Don't worry about me.

01:00:48.580 --> 01:00:49.693
I was called for this.

01:00:51.370 --> 01:00:53.177
- Okay, it's settled.

01:00:53.178 --> 01:00:55.239
Just meet me in a couple hours.

01:00:55.240 --> 01:00:56.160
Just call me.

01:00:56.161 --> 01:00:57.410
You know how to reach me.

01:01:01.170 --> 01:01:02.899
- I knew how Tanash thought and

01:01:02.900 --> 01:01:05.909
how he might try to use
my feelings against me.

01:01:05.910 --> 01:01:09.459
I had to be strong-minded and
not let the darkness in me.

01:01:09.460 --> 01:01:12.529
At the same time, I was fighting myself.

01:01:12.530 --> 01:01:16.783
Yes, he destroyed lots of
planets, but it wasn't really him.

01:01:17.620 --> 01:01:19.489
That's what I was telling myself.

01:01:19.490 --> 01:01:21.950
- You said we were brothers 'till the end.

01:01:25.450 --> 01:01:26.450
- Yeah I did!

01:01:28.620 --> 01:01:29.870
You chose the wrong path!

01:01:32.090 --> 01:01:35.373
- Oh Staleth, you were always such a baby.

01:01:38.190 --> 01:01:40.549
- I was acting like his savior,

01:01:40.550 --> 01:01:42.609
but that wasn't my role to play.

01:01:42.610 --> 01:01:46.269
I'm a bounty hunter, and it
was my job to take him down.

01:01:46.270 --> 01:01:47.770
- Remember when we were young?

01:01:49.830 --> 01:01:52.739
And we played hide and seek?

01:01:52.740 --> 01:01:54.299
- He kept
tempting me to remember our

01:01:54.300 --> 01:01:57.549
friendship and try to use that against me.

01:01:57.550 --> 01:02:01.299
He was like a snake,
cunning and ready to strike.

01:02:01.300 --> 01:02:03.399
Every time I had a shot, he'd use

01:02:03.400 --> 01:02:04.953
his powers to shield himself.

01:02:14.210 --> 01:02:15.223
Yeah, why?

01:02:20.804 --> 01:02:23.039
I thought to myself I could use

01:02:23.040 --> 01:02:25.123
the same manipulation to bring him down.

01:02:33.820 --> 01:02:36.215
- I'm having so much fun with you.

01:02:38.070 --> 01:02:39.949
- As I was shooting him, I had

01:02:39.950 --> 01:02:42.293
to be careful I was not too close to him.

01:02:43.430 --> 01:02:45.149
He could use my body as a vessel and

01:02:45.150 --> 01:02:47.458
the spirit of Demonia would possess me,

01:02:47.459 --> 01:02:48.649
but it seemed like none of the

01:02:48.650 --> 01:02:51.329
bullets I shot were even hurting him.

01:02:51.330 --> 01:02:53.579
His power seemed unstoppable.

01:02:53.580 --> 01:02:55.799
I knew now that I had to get close enough

01:02:55.800 --> 01:02:57.719
that his guard would be down so I could

01:02:57.720 --> 01:03:00.443
overpower him, but that
was easier said than done.

01:03:04.167 --> 01:03:07.000
- Oh Staleth, this is so much fun.

01:03:15.250 --> 01:03:17.239
- It's over, Tanash!

01:03:17.240 --> 01:03:18.490
Don't take one more step.

01:03:20.010 --> 01:03:22.529
I got my chance, I thought to myself.

01:03:22.530 --> 01:03:24.679
But what could go wrong went wrong.

01:03:24.680 --> 01:03:28.849
My gun jammed, and I couldn't
believe what I saw next.

01:03:28.850 --> 01:03:31.983
Yes, he'd perfected the
oblivion energy bomb.

01:03:33.010 --> 01:03:34.193
Without our god's help.

01:05:12.794 --> 01:05:17.627
Tanash, how can you continue
killing innocent human lives?

01:05:18.958 --> 01:05:21.458
- Get out of my head, Staleth!

01:05:24.530 --> 01:05:26.099
- We were meant to do great things in this

01:05:26.100 --> 01:05:29.743
universe and follow the
path of enlightenment.

01:05:31.910 --> 01:05:34.659
And be a beacon of strength and truth.

01:05:34.660 --> 01:05:35.993
Lead others to the light.

01:05:38.990 --> 01:05:40.640
It wasn't so long ago, my friend,

01:05:42.420 --> 01:05:44.223
that you shared the same beliefs.

01:05:47.170 --> 01:05:50.800
- Today you will learn
why a grain of sand...

01:05:53.520 --> 01:05:56.303
Is as important as Vortex, our planet.

01:05:57.780 --> 01:05:59.180
- How could this be, master?

01:06:00.470 --> 01:06:03.259
- Yeah, that sounds a little way off.

01:06:03.260 --> 01:06:05.239
- Our planet consists of two moons.

01:06:05.240 --> 01:06:09.149
There is no darkness,
but light day and night.

01:06:09.150 --> 01:06:11.750
But there is darkness when
all the light is covered.

01:06:12.910 --> 01:06:14.290
- I don't understand.

01:06:15.449 --> 01:06:17.394
- Do you understand, Staleth?

01:06:17.395 --> 01:06:20.369
- I believe I say the grain
of sand is as important

01:06:20.370 --> 01:06:22.520
to our planet because
it's all part of one?

01:06:24.060 --> 01:06:24.990
- Yes.

01:06:24.991 --> 01:06:26.989
If you and Tanash are
separate in heart and

01:06:26.990 --> 01:06:30.939
spirit, only destruction
and chaos will come of it.

01:06:30.940 --> 01:06:32.349
- I understand now.

01:06:32.350 --> 01:06:36.209
If we both die or live, then
in a sense we are together.

01:06:36.210 --> 01:06:38.763
- Use the wisdom for good, not for evil.

01:06:40.440 --> 01:06:43.135
- I am doing great things, Staleth.

01:06:43.136 --> 01:06:45.009
Who do you think went back through time?

01:06:45.010 --> 01:06:47.523
And I was called Jack the Ripper.

01:06:49.040 --> 01:06:53.749
- Your reign of killing humans
and other species will end.

01:06:53.750 --> 01:06:55.533
I will not allow you to continue.

01:06:59.120 --> 01:07:02.603
- You don't even have half
the power I possess, Staleth.

01:07:04.430 --> 01:07:06.829
- Power, without responsibility,

01:07:06.830 --> 01:07:08.880
will only destroy you at the end, Tanash.

01:07:13.010 --> 01:07:14.773
- Let the games begin.

01:08:01.765 --> 01:08:03.393
You haven't changed, Staleth.

01:08:04.997 --> 01:08:06.409
You know I'm playing with you.

01:08:06.410 --> 01:08:08.253
I can easily destroy you.

01:08:09.690 --> 01:08:12.439
- The darkness has filled
your heart, Tanash.

01:08:12.440 --> 01:08:14.599
Just turn yourself in.

01:08:14.600 --> 01:08:15.897
I don't wanna kill you.

01:08:18.874 --> 01:08:21.519
- The only one who will be killed is you.

01:08:21.520 --> 01:08:24.533
Stop talking so much
and let's end this now.

01:09:12.035 --> 01:09:13.703
Staleth, join me.

01:09:14.680 --> 01:09:15.912
It's not too late.

01:09:16.970 --> 01:09:18.600
Together we're invincible.

01:09:19.803 --> 01:09:22.788
I'm giving you one more chance.

01:09:22.790 --> 01:09:23.790
- No.

01:09:24.600 --> 01:09:27.029
There's nothing else to talk about.

01:09:27.031 --> 01:09:28.082
I'm taking you down.

01:09:59.049 --> 01:10:00.049
- Staleth!

01:10:00.910 --> 01:10:02.237
Where are you?

01:10:12.202 --> 01:10:13.202
Staleth!

01:10:14.176 --> 01:10:15.748
Are you okay?

01:10:15.749 --> 01:10:16.749
- Yeah.

01:10:33.530 --> 01:10:34.863
- What happened?

01:10:38.311 --> 01:10:41.894
- I didn't know he
perfected the shockwave.

01:10:47.469 --> 01:10:50.089
- Staleth, be honest with me.

01:10:50.090 --> 01:10:52.073
Do we even have a chance to stop him?

01:10:53.370 --> 01:10:54.959
- Yes.

01:10:54.960 --> 01:10:55.960
Have faith.

01:10:57.510 --> 01:10:58.510
- I'm trying.

01:10:59.340 --> 01:11:02.277
- He will slip up, and
then we'll stop him.

01:11:08.870 --> 01:11:10.277
- Anymore readings on him?

01:11:11.455 --> 01:11:12.909
- Yes.

01:11:12.910 --> 01:11:14.663
He's looking for a family to kill.

01:11:16.387 --> 01:11:19.033
- Staleth, let me die
for what I believe in.

01:11:19.880 --> 01:11:22.099
Don't jeopardize saving lives for me

01:11:22.100 --> 01:11:23.633
if we get into that situation.

01:11:24.620 --> 01:11:27.383
Please, promise me you will.

01:11:29.210 --> 01:11:31.199
- I promise you, my friend.

01:11:31.200 --> 01:11:32.200
I will.

01:11:33.172 --> 01:11:38.172
- Okay.

01:12:02.090 --> 01:12:05.493
- Now who else should I kill?

01:12:11.850 --> 01:12:14.243
A nice American family would be nice.

01:12:17.675 --> 01:12:18.743
Yes.

01:12:20.307 --> 01:12:21.307
Hungry.

01:12:22.460 --> 01:12:23.760
I'm thirsty for the blood.

01:12:26.434 --> 01:12:31.434
Staleth, if you can hear me,
come and save them if you can.

01:12:41.870 --> 01:12:44.120
- Colinus, let's rest here.

01:12:45.450 --> 01:12:46.983
We'll follow him in the morning.

01:12:47.930 --> 01:12:49.330
He's too dangerous at night.

01:12:51.295 --> 01:12:52.295
- Okay.

01:12:53.313 --> 01:12:54.396
What's wrong?

01:13:00.320 --> 01:13:01.370
- He hungers to kill.

01:13:03.230 --> 01:13:04.530
He's looking for a family.

01:13:05.490 --> 01:13:07.149
- What do we do?

01:13:07.150 --> 01:13:09.149
- Let's just rest here tonight.

01:13:09.150 --> 01:13:11.800
And tomorrow we'll stop him
from hurting anyone else.

01:13:14.565 --> 01:13:18.093
- I don't know how someone
can turn out to be so evil.

01:13:19.330 --> 01:13:21.480
- You can't change
someone's heart or mind.

01:13:22.600 --> 01:13:26.163
If they choose power or greed,
they'll destroy themselves.

01:13:27.420 --> 01:13:30.449
And they'll kill a lot of
innocent people in their path.

01:13:30.450 --> 01:13:32.913
- Well right now he can die.

01:13:33.970 --> 01:13:35.879
Next time I see him, I'm putting

01:13:35.880 --> 01:13:37.969
a bullet right between his eyes.

01:13:37.970 --> 01:13:39.550
See how tough he is then.

01:13:42.433 --> 01:13:45.639
- Colinus, don't underestimate him.

01:13:45.640 --> 01:13:47.409
He's well trained.

01:13:47.410 --> 01:13:49.379
That's all I ask.

01:13:49.380 --> 01:13:50.380
- Sure.

01:13:59.400 --> 01:14:00.400
- Mama?

01:14:01.310 --> 01:14:04.373
Mom?

01:14:04.374 --> 01:14:05.957
- Baby, what is it?

01:14:09.182 --> 01:14:12.698
- I, I, I had a bad dream that some

01:14:12.699 --> 01:14:16.123
monster was gonna come and kill us all.

01:14:17.140 --> 01:14:20.159
- Oh my gosh honey, don't think like that.

01:14:20.160 --> 01:14:21.523
- But it's so scary.

01:14:22.620 --> 01:14:24.508
- I know baby, it was a dream.

01:14:24.509 --> 01:14:26.469
- Just get to bed.

01:14:26.470 --> 01:14:27.707
- Come on, get in bed.

01:14:31.030 --> 01:14:32.153
Come on, baby.

01:14:37.220 --> 01:14:38.420
- It seemed so real.

01:14:39.310 --> 01:14:40.310
- I know.

01:14:41.699 --> 01:14:44.116
I'll hold you all night long.

01:15:25.913 --> 01:15:27.324
- What's going on?

01:15:27.325 --> 01:15:28.240
- We need to move fast.

01:15:28.241 --> 01:15:29.619
He's getting close to the family.

01:15:29.620 --> 01:15:30.453
Here.

01:15:30.453 --> 01:15:31.453
- Thanks.

01:15:39.089 --> 01:15:40.569
You have a vision on him yet?

01:15:40.570 --> 01:15:42.113
- Yeah, he's going west.

01:15:45.370 --> 01:15:47.911
Don't take chances with him okay?

01:15:47.912 --> 01:15:48.745
You know how he is.

01:15:48.746 --> 01:15:50.443
Are you listening to me, Colinus?

01:15:52.568 --> 01:15:54.069
- Yeah.

01:15:54.070 --> 01:15:56.406
I can't believe how good a shot you are.

01:15:56.407 --> 01:15:58.741
And you still didn't kill him yet.

01:15:58.742 --> 01:16:00.073
- You think I didn't shoot him?

01:16:01.260 --> 01:16:02.769
Aw come on.

01:16:02.770 --> 01:16:03.989
You didn't think I hit him?

01:16:03.990 --> 01:16:05.190
He's definitely wounded.

01:16:06.690 --> 01:16:08.290
His powers are getting stronger.

01:16:09.640 --> 01:16:10.893
Keep up with me, okay?

01:16:12.360 --> 01:16:13.989
Don't make any desperate moves.

01:16:13.990 --> 01:16:15.319
He's gonna be tough to catch.

01:16:15.320 --> 01:16:17.683
He's not gonna be so easy, this guy.

01:16:19.850 --> 01:16:22.893
We'll take him down no
matter what the cost is.

01:16:26.464 --> 01:16:28.199
Here, this is my lucky one.

01:16:28.200 --> 01:16:30.449
You have to make sure you're focused

01:16:30.450 --> 01:16:32.163
'cause you might only have one shot.

01:16:39.500 --> 01:16:40.500
Okay, let's go.

01:16:41.330 --> 01:16:43.330
- I'm not going down this time, Staleth.

01:16:50.823 --> 01:16:52.899
- Yo Charlie, let me show you how

01:16:52.900 --> 01:16:54.993
a real country boy shoots his cans.

01:16:56.153 --> 01:16:57.003
- All right.

01:16:57.004 --> 01:16:58.253
- Hold my beer.

01:17:07.123 --> 01:17:09.156
- Well that wasn't that
bad, little brother.

01:17:09.157 --> 01:17:10.909
- Let's see what you got, shrimp.

01:17:10.910 --> 01:17:12.949
- Come on now, you know I
taught you how to shoot.

01:17:12.950 --> 01:17:14.139
Let's bet some money on this.

01:17:14.140 --> 01:17:15.409
- Let's make it $20.

01:17:15.410 --> 01:17:17.595
- All right, how about 40?

01:17:17.596 --> 01:17:19.169
- How about 50?

01:17:19.170 --> 01:17:20.563
- 50 it is, all right.

01:17:24.650 --> 01:17:26.769
And I'm $50 richer.

01:17:26.770 --> 01:17:28.903
- Goddamn, I owe you 50 bucks, Charlie!

01:17:32.090 --> 01:17:33.090
- Nice shot.

01:17:34.520 --> 01:17:35.989
- Hey sir, this is private property,

01:17:35.990 --> 01:17:37.529
you ain't allowed to be here.

01:17:37.530 --> 01:17:40.410
- I understand son,
but my car broke down a

01:17:40.411 --> 01:17:44.229
mile away, and I need to
use your phone if I could.

01:17:44.230 --> 01:17:45.989
Just one phone call.

01:17:45.990 --> 01:17:47.649
Do you mind?

01:17:47.650 --> 01:17:50.109
- Come on Charlie, give the guy a break.

01:17:50.110 --> 01:17:51.849
There's nowhere to go around here.

01:17:51.850 --> 01:17:54.129
Let the poor fella use the phone.

01:17:54.130 --> 01:17:55.659
- Okay, take him around the back by

01:17:55.660 --> 01:17:58.407
the pool, I'll clean up
everything over here.

01:17:58.408 --> 01:18:00.817
- Thank you, thank you, man.

01:18:03.616 --> 01:18:05.639
- You're not from around
here are you, sir?

01:18:05.640 --> 01:18:07.040
You from Italy or something?

01:18:08.790 --> 01:18:10.229
- No I'm not.

01:18:10.230 --> 01:18:11.719
- Where are you exactly from, sir?

01:18:11.720 --> 01:18:13.869
'Cause I've never seen someone
like you from these parts.

01:18:13.870 --> 01:18:16.543
- I'm really from far, far away.

01:18:18.750 --> 01:18:20.199
- I got a granny in Louisiana.

01:18:20.200 --> 01:18:21.313
How far are you from?

01:18:32.010 --> 01:18:33.179
You all right, sir?

01:18:33.180 --> 01:18:34.229
- Yes.

01:18:34.230 --> 01:18:35.633
I need your phone please.

01:18:36.500 --> 01:18:38.039
- Just wait here for a minute.

01:18:38.040 --> 01:18:39.363
- Okay, I'll sit here.

01:18:48.279 --> 01:18:49.529
Thank you, son.

01:18:51.420 --> 01:18:52.919
Sit down.

01:18:52.920 --> 01:18:55.259
- Sure, I'll
pop a squat right here.

01:18:55.260 --> 01:18:56.260
- Hello?

01:18:57.720 --> 01:18:59.993
Hello, yes, I'm Tanash.

01:19:02.860 --> 01:19:04.110
What's your address, son?

01:19:05.120 --> 01:19:07.419
- 3240 Mac Road.

01:19:07.420 --> 01:19:09.102
- Look into my eyes.

01:19:10.600 --> 01:19:11.600
- Wow.

01:19:22.305 --> 01:19:23.388
- Where am I?

01:19:36.600 --> 01:19:38.613
- I told you you were gonna die, sir!

01:19:43.680 --> 01:19:45.430
I told you you were gonna die, sir.

01:19:57.190 --> 01:19:58.740
Let's make you nice and pretty.

01:20:05.250 --> 01:20:07.225
I told you you were gonna die, sir.

01:20:07.226 --> 01:20:09.269
I told you you were gonna die!

01:20:09.270 --> 01:20:10.977
Now you're dead, right?

01:20:10.978 --> 01:20:12.801
Nice and easy.

01:20:12.802 --> 01:20:14.052
Hands of death.

01:20:15.677 --> 01:20:16.844
Nice and easy.

01:20:23.143 --> 01:20:25.203
The good ones always die young.

01:20:30.570 --> 01:20:33.099
- I'd been with
Colinus for over five years now.

01:20:33.100 --> 01:20:34.569
We're a good team.

01:20:34.570 --> 01:20:36.299
Between both of us, we've brought in

01:20:36.300 --> 01:20:38.523
over a hundred convicts around the galaxy.

01:20:39.370 --> 01:20:42.169
But none as deadly as Tanash.

01:20:42.170 --> 01:20:43.449
I know what Colinus thinks.

01:20:43.450 --> 01:20:45.419
I've been soft-handling him.

01:20:45.420 --> 01:20:48.119
Maybe he's right, but I was taught

01:20:48.120 --> 01:20:51.309
by our gods to forgive and not hold hate.

01:20:51.310 --> 01:20:53.829
That can lead to the
darkness within and destroy

01:20:53.830 --> 01:20:57.013
my soul and energy, which
is my essence of life.

01:20:57.990 --> 01:21:00.950
My power is not as developed as Tanash's,

01:21:00.951 --> 01:21:03.159
and I knew that one more encounter with

01:21:03.160 --> 01:21:06.999
Tanash could literally
destroy me and Colinus.

01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:10.439
We had to make sure he was
not aware we knew where

01:21:10.440 --> 01:21:15.053
he was and to get him by
surprise would not be easy.

01:21:15.930 --> 01:21:18.439
Earth's hope was in our hands and we

01:21:18.440 --> 01:21:21.163
could not let one more
planet be destroyed.

01:21:22.330 --> 01:21:25.563
And millions and millions
of innocent people die.

01:21:26.490 --> 01:21:27.959
Me and Colinus were ready to give

01:21:27.960 --> 01:21:30.679
up our lives for these people because

01:21:30.680 --> 01:21:33.021
we knew that every lifeform deserves

01:21:33.022 --> 01:21:36.089
to live and evolve like we did.

01:21:36.090 --> 01:21:38.659
Someday Earth would join us and

01:21:38.660 --> 01:21:41.602
become part of our new world order.

01:22:10.149 --> 01:22:12.450
- Hey mom, please please please

01:22:12.451 --> 01:22:13.931
please please just get me a new bike.

01:22:15.700 --> 01:22:17.600
Julie, she got one last week.

01:22:18.907 --> 01:22:20.851
- Where are those boys?

01:22:20.852 --> 01:22:22.319
- Please please please please?

01:22:22.320 --> 01:22:24.489
Julie got one yesterday and she's

01:22:24.490 --> 01:22:26.906
been bragging about it at school.

01:22:26.907 --> 01:22:28.959
- Okay, let me ask your daddy okay?

01:22:28.960 --> 01:22:30.299
It's not up to me.

01:22:30.300 --> 01:22:32.279
- Honey, where are the boys?

01:22:32.280 --> 01:22:33.989
- I don't know, but I was gonna say

01:22:33.990 --> 01:22:36.139
do you think that she can get a new bike?

01:22:36.140 --> 01:22:38.319
- We talked about this last week.

01:22:38.320 --> 01:22:40.219
We don't have the money,
they're gonna repossess

01:22:40.220 --> 01:22:42.099
the truck, and our dinner's getting cold.

01:22:42.100 --> 01:22:44.919
Where are our boys, 6:30 is dinnertime!

01:22:44.920 --> 01:22:46.729
- You need to stop yelling at me!

01:22:46.730 --> 01:22:48.809
- Boy, where have you been?
- Where have you been?

01:22:48.810 --> 01:22:50.399
- Y'all know
we eat dinner at 6:30.

01:22:50.400 --> 01:22:51.969
- We were outside shooting cans and some

01:22:51.970 --> 01:22:52.937
man's car broke down right next to

01:22:52.938 --> 01:22:55.369
us and now he's helping him out.

01:22:55.370 --> 01:22:56.203
- Helping somebody?

01:22:56.204 --> 01:22:57.359
When has Tommy ever helped somebody?

01:22:57.360 --> 01:22:59.347
- I don't know, that
doesn't sound like him.

01:22:59.348 --> 01:23:02.021
- Boy, where have you been?

01:23:02.022 --> 01:23:03.272
- What?

01:23:03.273 --> 01:23:05.013
- Have you been drinking again?

01:23:06.838 --> 01:23:08.088
- What?

01:23:09.022 --> 01:23:12.519
- Oh I know you didn't
just yell at your daddy!

01:23:12.520 --> 01:23:14.249
- What are you gonna do, huh?

01:23:14.250 --> 01:23:16.119
- Stop disrespecting your daddy!

01:23:16.120 --> 01:23:18.193
- Don't you talk to me like that, boy.

01:23:23.610 --> 01:23:26.099
- Best stop disrespecting your daddy.

01:23:26.100 --> 01:23:28.833
- You been in my White
Lightning, haven't you boy?

01:23:30.236 --> 01:23:32.784
- Oh I'm sorry, your majesty.

01:23:32.785 --> 01:23:34.843
- What has gotten into this boy?

01:23:34.844 --> 01:23:35.897
- Humans.

01:23:36.783 --> 01:23:37.616
- Humans?

01:23:37.617 --> 01:23:38.829
- You on drugs?

01:23:38.830 --> 01:23:41.710
- You been smoking that wacky tobaccy?

01:23:41.711 --> 01:23:43.601
- Tom, relax.

01:23:43.602 --> 01:23:45.221
Have you been on that weed again?

01:23:45.222 --> 01:23:46.186
- No, no.

01:23:46.187 --> 01:23:47.959
- Tommy's scaring me.

01:23:47.960 --> 01:23:49.900
- It's okay, honey.

01:23:49.901 --> 01:23:53.097
I'm sorry, we all got a little upset.

01:23:53.098 --> 01:23:54.716
- What's going on with you today?

01:23:54.717 --> 01:23:57.589
- Tommy, what happened
to that man's truck anyway?

01:23:57.590 --> 01:24:01.626
- He went running like
he went straight to Hell.

01:24:01.627 --> 01:24:03.421
- What is so funny?

01:24:15.855 --> 01:24:17.026
- Do you sense something?

01:24:17.027 --> 01:24:18.110
- Yeah, I do.

01:24:24.923 --> 01:24:28.143
It's not clear, but I
feel this is the house.

01:24:44.020 --> 01:24:46.492
You go around the back,
I'll go around this way.

01:25:54.210 --> 01:25:57.289
I sense this is the house.

01:25:57.290 --> 01:25:58.290
- Are you sure?

01:25:59.560 --> 01:26:01.699
- Yeah, put your gun away.

01:26:01.700 --> 01:26:02.800
He knows we're coming.

01:26:10.163 --> 01:26:12.163
- Charlie, get the door.

01:26:15.800 --> 01:26:17.329
Tommy, you done pissed me off, you made

01:26:17.330 --> 01:26:19.330
me look like a fool in front of my boss!

01:26:23.330 --> 01:26:24.959
- Can I help you, sir?

01:26:24.960 --> 01:26:27.789
- Yes, my name is
Staleth, this is Colinus.

01:26:27.790 --> 01:26:29.199
We're bounty hunters, we're looking for

01:26:29.200 --> 01:26:30.809
a man, he's about 30 years old,

01:26:30.810 --> 01:26:32.919
medium build, short hair, any man

01:26:32.920 --> 01:26:34.849
matching that description
even pass by here?

01:26:34.850 --> 01:26:37.543
- Yeah, this man came by,
he used the phone and left.

01:26:40.670 --> 01:26:42.719
- Really, is he still here?

01:26:42.720 --> 01:26:44.663
- Yeah, my brother saw him leave.

01:26:45.900 --> 01:26:46.733
- Are you sure?

01:26:46.734 --> 01:26:47.969
- Yes sir.

01:26:47.970 --> 01:26:49.649
- Well he's extremely dangerous, you need

01:26:49.650 --> 01:26:52.009
to warn your family about this man.

01:26:52.010 --> 01:26:54.499
- Yeah, he was pretty
weird, something about him.

01:26:54.500 --> 01:26:56.259
- All right, keep your eyes open.

01:26:56.260 --> 01:26:58.609
- Well thank you sir, I'm
gonna warn my family right now.

01:26:58.610 --> 01:26:59.610
Be safe, guys.

01:27:05.310 --> 01:27:06.743
- He is acting crazy!

01:27:10.525 --> 01:27:13.942
- What has gotten into this boy?

01:27:15.968 --> 01:27:17.459
- What is going on?

01:27:17.460 --> 01:27:19.349
- That's the same thing your pa was doing.

01:27:19.350 --> 01:27:21.827
- I know, we need to take him to a shrink.

01:27:22.920 --> 01:27:24.479
- You really think he's not in there?

01:27:24.480 --> 01:27:26.889
- Yeah, he's there, but
his power's a lot stronger.

01:27:26.890 --> 01:27:28.369
But that was definitely not him.

01:27:28.370 --> 01:27:29.739
- So you don't know where he is.

01:27:29.740 --> 01:27:32.279
- No, but we have to wait
out here 'till it gets dark.

01:27:32.280 --> 01:27:33.589
- How long should we wait?

01:27:33.590 --> 01:27:34.570
- About three or four hours, but he'll

01:27:34.571 --> 01:27:35.879
play with the family first.

01:27:35.880 --> 01:27:36.713
But if we don't get him, he is

01:27:36.714 --> 01:27:38.822
gonna kill every single one in there.

01:27:38.823 --> 01:27:42.299
- Okay Staleth, let's make
sure we're on the same page.

01:27:42.300 --> 01:27:43.300
- Good.

01:27:46.024 --> 01:27:47.774
- What are you doing?

01:27:49.220 --> 01:27:51.120
- Hey, so who was at the door Charlie?

01:27:52.740 --> 01:27:54.059
- You won't believe this, but that man

01:27:54.060 --> 01:27:55.669
that came use the phone
earlier, he's a killer

01:27:55.670 --> 01:27:57.870
and there are some
bounty hunters after him.

01:27:58.830 --> 01:28:01.463
- Steven, I'm scared for our family.

01:28:02.420 --> 01:28:04.579
- Honey, he's gone.

01:28:04.580 --> 01:28:06.709
But look, just to be safe, we'll have

01:28:06.710 --> 01:28:08.809
the boys lock up the windows real good.

01:28:08.810 --> 01:28:11.059
They got their guns, I'll have mine

01:28:11.060 --> 01:28:13.433
just in case he comes
back, don't you worry.

01:28:14.340 --> 01:28:15.340
- Mom.

01:28:16.530 --> 01:28:18.833
I told you someone was coming to kill us.

01:28:21.870 --> 01:28:23.409
- Don't talk like that, honey.

01:28:23.410 --> 01:28:25.240
We are safe here.

01:28:25.241 --> 01:28:27.859
We are gonna be okay, don't worry.

01:28:27.860 --> 01:28:29.073
Mommy loves you.

01:28:30.960 --> 01:28:32.193
- It's gonna be okay.

01:28:33.260 --> 01:28:34.561
- What's Tommy's doing?

01:28:34.562 --> 01:28:36.183
- Look, you are scaring your sister!

01:28:38.070 --> 01:28:40.939
- Tommy, stop that now, boy!

01:28:40.940 --> 01:28:43.407
- Take that knife away from him!

01:28:44.274 --> 01:28:45.779
- We're gonna kill that
son of a bitch right?

01:28:45.780 --> 01:28:48.059
- Hey, we don't use that foul language!

01:28:48.060 --> 01:28:49.743
- Oh I'm sorry, dad!

01:28:52.840 --> 01:28:55.129
- Tommy, what is wrong with you?

01:28:55.130 --> 01:28:56.249
- I'm bored.

01:28:56.250 --> 01:28:57.707
This is gonna be so much fun.

01:28:59.731 --> 01:29:01.849
- Hey, everything's gonna be all right.

01:29:01.850 --> 01:29:03.869
We're gonna have a nice dinner.

01:29:03.870 --> 01:29:06.220
Let's everybody bow our
heads to say grace now.

01:29:07.720 --> 01:29:09.083
- Can I say grace, dad?

01:29:10.010 --> 01:29:11.823
- Tommy, I'd like that, boy.

01:29:13.940 --> 01:29:15.859
- Hello God.

01:29:15.860 --> 01:29:17.030
You know who I am.

01:29:18.343 --> 01:29:22.143
I've been having so much
fun with all Your children.

01:29:23.730 --> 01:29:26.950
And I can't wait to have
more fun with all of them.

01:29:29.080 --> 01:29:30.429
- Boy, what kind of grace is that?

01:29:30.430 --> 01:29:32.823
Get your ass in the room!

01:29:33.681 --> 01:29:35.029
- Okay.

01:29:35.030 --> 01:29:36.130
- Damn devil.

01:29:40.410 --> 01:29:43.116
- I got a bad feeling about this.

01:29:43.117 --> 01:29:45.659
It means his powers are getting stronger.

01:29:45.660 --> 01:29:47.820
I can't even read him right now.

01:29:50.072 --> 01:29:51.172
- What are you saying?

01:29:54.450 --> 01:29:56.259
- What I'm saying is I
sense his presence here.

01:29:56.260 --> 01:29:58.160
It can be any of these family members.

01:30:01.440 --> 01:30:02.873
- So how do we stop him?

01:30:05.738 --> 01:30:07.821
- It's not gonna be easy.

01:30:13.530 --> 01:30:15.629
- Staleth, come here!

01:30:15.630 --> 01:30:16.750
- What'd you find?

01:30:17.460 --> 01:30:18.560
- I think I found him.

01:30:38.725 --> 01:30:40.058
What do you see?

01:30:41.950 --> 01:30:45.483
- I saw when he choked a man,
but I can't see his face.

01:30:47.310 --> 01:30:48.979
- So what do we do?

01:30:48.980 --> 01:30:50.330
- We gotta warn the family.

01:30:52.590 --> 01:30:55.229
- Come on, they're
gonna think we're crazy.

01:30:55.230 --> 01:30:56.063
What are we gonna tell them?

01:30:56.064 --> 01:30:58.413
That one of their family
members is possessed?

01:31:00.190 --> 01:31:02.509
- What we gotta do is wait
'till they go to sleep.

01:31:02.510 --> 01:31:04.008
Okay, you go around the back, I'll go

01:31:04.009 --> 01:31:06.659
around the front, but
you can't trust anyone.

01:31:06.660 --> 01:31:07.660
Are you with me?

01:31:09.160 --> 01:31:10.860
Come on, let's search the grounds.

01:31:14.810 --> 01:31:17.506
- Charlie, what's going on
with your brother Tommy?

01:31:17.507 --> 01:31:19.189
- I don't know, he's
been fine all dad, pops.

01:31:19.190 --> 01:31:21.840
I just don't really know
what got into him right now.

01:31:23.460 --> 01:31:24.390
- Is he doing drugs?

01:31:24.391 --> 01:31:26.111
- No ma'am, I don't think he is.

01:31:26.112 --> 01:31:28.029
- He's doing something.

01:31:29.509 --> 01:31:30.859
- What the hell's going on?

01:31:34.250 --> 01:31:35.170
- Could it be that killer?

01:31:35.171 --> 01:31:36.709
He said there's a killer on the loose!

01:31:36.710 --> 01:31:38.479
- Everybody calm down!

01:31:38.480 --> 01:31:41.299
It's just the breaker, listen,
it's just the breaker, y'all.

01:31:41.300 --> 01:31:43.648
I'll get it, where's that flashlight?

01:31:43.649 --> 01:31:45.103
- It's in the pantry.

01:31:45.104 --> 01:31:46.199
- Gotta grab your gun too.

01:31:46.200 --> 01:31:47.033
- All right.

01:31:47.034 --> 01:31:49.200
- You be careful.

01:31:51.985 --> 01:31:53.033
- Here dad, take this.

01:31:53.034 --> 01:31:53.867
- All right.

01:31:53.868 --> 01:31:56.177
All right, you take of your
mom and your sister okay?

01:31:56.178 --> 01:31:57.352
- I will.

01:31:57.353 --> 01:31:58.372
- I know, I'm sorry, I'm so sorry,

01:31:58.373 --> 01:32:00.763
I didn't mean to get you scared.

01:32:01.680 --> 01:32:04.599
Mommy's just silly sometimes, I'm sorry.

01:32:04.600 --> 01:32:07.739
Everything's fine, the
lights have gone out before.

01:32:07.740 --> 01:32:09.969
It's no big deal, I love you.

01:32:09.970 --> 01:32:11.189
- Feels different.

01:32:11.190 --> 01:32:13.259
- No, it's okay baby.

01:32:13.260 --> 01:32:14.260
It's okay.

01:32:16.630 --> 01:32:19.879
- It'll be fine, dad will take
care of everybody all right?

01:32:19.880 --> 01:32:20.889
- You sure?

01:32:20.890 --> 01:32:22.080
- Yes, I promise.

01:32:22.081 --> 01:32:24.884
- It'll be okay, baby.

01:33:01.750 --> 01:33:03.319
- Listen guys, everything's
gonna be fine all right?

01:33:03.320 --> 01:33:04.629
Daddy's out there taking care of business,

01:33:04.630 --> 01:33:06.562
we got enough guns, we got ammo.

01:33:06.563 --> 01:33:08.329
Everything's gonna be fine all right?

01:33:08.330 --> 01:33:10.899
You just stop being so emotional.

01:33:10.900 --> 01:33:11.890
- But we're scared.

01:33:11.891 --> 01:33:14.758
- I understand, daddy's
gonna take care of this.

01:33:14.759 --> 01:33:17.554
- I know, but well, you
be careful with that gun.

01:33:17.555 --> 01:33:18.388
- Everything's fine.

01:33:18.388 --> 01:33:19.388
Dad, where are you?

01:33:20.784 --> 01:33:23.129
- It's okay, darling.

01:33:23.130 --> 01:33:24.130
- Dad!

01:33:53.771 --> 01:33:55.473
- Stop there, you son of a bitch!

01:33:55.474 --> 01:33:56.405
You cut my electricity?

01:33:56.405 --> 01:33:57.238
What you doing on my property?

01:33:57.239 --> 01:33:58.609
- You got it all wrong.

01:33:58.610 --> 01:34:00.356
You got it all wrong,
I'm here to help you.

01:34:00.357 --> 01:34:02.009
- Get back, what are you doing here?

01:34:02.010 --> 01:34:03.551
- I'm not the killer, but someone

01:34:03.552 --> 01:34:06.186
in your family is the killer.

01:34:06.187 --> 01:34:07.529
I'm here to help, you need to calm

01:34:07.530 --> 01:34:09.159
yourself down, put that gun down.

01:34:09.160 --> 01:34:09.993
Put that gun down!

01:34:09.994 --> 01:34:12.779
- You're on my property,
you're on my property!

01:34:12.780 --> 01:34:14.449
- Put that gun down.

01:34:14.450 --> 01:34:16.911
- No, I'm gonna get the sheriff out here.

01:34:16.912 --> 01:34:18.002
- You got two boys?

01:34:18.003 --> 01:34:19.529
You got two boys in there?

01:34:19.530 --> 01:34:21.539
- Yeah I got two boys, how
do you know I got two boys?

01:34:21.540 --> 01:34:23.209
- Your daughter, is she acting crazy?

01:34:23.210 --> 01:34:24.705
- You talking about my daughter?

01:34:24.706 --> 01:34:25.871
Get back, man!

01:34:25.872 --> 01:34:27.159
Get back, what you
talking about my daughter?

01:34:27.160 --> 01:34:28.213
- What about your wife?

01:34:29.760 --> 01:34:30.959
- Turn around!

01:34:30.960 --> 01:34:31.960
Turn around.

01:34:32.840 --> 01:34:33.840
Move up there.

01:34:34.790 --> 01:34:36.459
- Sir, you got it all wrong.

01:34:36.460 --> 01:34:37.779
- Maybe you're right.

01:34:37.780 --> 01:34:38.770
Maybe you're right, turn around.

01:34:38.770 --> 01:34:39.603
- I'm here to help you!

01:34:39.603 --> 01:34:40.436
- Turn around!

01:34:40.436 --> 01:34:41.269
- I'm here to help--

01:34:41.269 --> 01:34:42.269
- Lights out!

01:34:45.823 --> 01:34:47.761
- It's gonna be fine guys, it's all right.

01:34:47.762 --> 01:34:48.595
Dad!

01:34:48.596 --> 01:34:50.068
- Shut up, listen.

01:34:50.069 --> 01:34:50.902
- What?

01:34:50.903 --> 01:34:52.092
- I found a man outside
creeping around, okay?

01:34:52.093 --> 01:34:54.261
I need you to call the police, listen.

01:34:54.262 --> 01:34:55.095
- You kill him?

01:34:55.095 --> 01:34:55.928
- Call the, I don't know, call the police

01:34:55.929 --> 01:34:57.579
right now, I'm going to get your brother.

01:34:57.580 --> 01:34:58.719
You stay here with Tania.

01:34:58.720 --> 01:34:59.909
I love you, baby girl.

01:34:59.910 --> 01:35:01.143
Just stay here.

01:35:10.804 --> 01:35:11.896
- Staleth.

01:35:11.897 --> 01:35:12.909
Staleth!

01:35:12.910 --> 01:35:14.162
Staleth!

01:35:14.163 --> 01:35:15.163
Staleth!

01:35:17.353 --> 01:35:18.807
What happened?

01:35:18.808 --> 01:35:20.225
- You were right.

01:35:22.201 --> 01:35:23.170
They didn't believe us.

01:35:23.171 --> 01:35:24.389
They were wrong.

01:35:24.390 --> 01:35:25.783
You need to watch your back.

01:35:27.090 --> 01:35:28.090
- Here.

01:35:39.836 --> 01:35:41.011
- Come on, phone.

01:35:41.012 --> 01:35:43.012
Think they cut the line.

01:35:44.698 --> 01:35:45.687
- Tommy, let's go, boy!

01:35:45.688 --> 01:35:47.589
I found a crazy man running around

01:35:47.590 --> 01:35:48.809
outside, I got him tied up!

01:35:48.810 --> 01:35:50.029
Your brother's calling the police!

01:35:50.030 --> 01:35:51.733
Come on, we gotta get out of here!

01:35:51.734 --> 01:35:52.796
- That's not gonna help.

01:35:52.797 --> 01:35:54.147
You're all gonna die.

01:35:55.097 --> 01:35:57.209
- Boy, stop talking crazy!

01:35:57.210 --> 01:35:59.299
Let's go, come on, I need you!

01:35:59.300 --> 01:36:01.511
- Go get my gun over
there in the closet, pa.

01:36:01.512 --> 01:36:03.529
- It's in the closet?

01:36:03.530 --> 01:36:05.843
All right, where's it at?

01:36:05.844 --> 01:36:07.844
- It's to the left side.

01:36:16.790 --> 01:36:18.271
- This phone working?

01:36:20.530 --> 01:36:21.503
Tommy, what is that?

01:36:21.504 --> 01:36:23.439
Is that blood on there?

01:36:23.440 --> 01:36:25.659
Is that, what's going on?

01:36:25.660 --> 01:36:26.749
- Dad is dead.

01:36:26.750 --> 01:36:28.413
I found this knife in the hall.

01:36:29.886 --> 01:36:31.469
- Tania, come here.

01:36:33.529 --> 01:36:34.362
- What?

01:36:34.363 --> 01:36:35.424
- What are you talking about?

01:36:35.425 --> 01:36:36.979
- I found this knife in the hall.

01:36:36.980 --> 01:36:39.143
- What are you talking about?

01:36:39.144 --> 01:36:41.287
- They killed dad.

01:36:41.288 --> 01:36:42.747
Dad is dead, mama.

01:36:42.748 --> 01:36:43.998
They killed him.

01:36:46.991 --> 01:36:47.991
- Steven!

01:36:50.376 --> 01:36:51.871
No!

01:36:56.245 --> 01:36:58.952
- What are we gonna do?

01:36:58.953 --> 01:37:03.953
We're all gonna die here.

01:37:05.003 --> 01:37:08.539
- No we won't, we're all
gonna get out of here.

01:37:08.540 --> 01:37:09.875
- Just killed another one.

01:37:09.876 --> 01:37:11.879
We're gonna have to get inside right now.

01:37:11.880 --> 01:37:13.399
Hello there!

01:37:13.400 --> 01:37:14.849
You need to keep your hands up in the air!

01:37:14.850 --> 01:37:16.806
We mean you no harm, but
there's a killer in there!

01:37:16.807 --> 01:37:18.769
- Don't listen to them, Charlie.

01:37:18.770 --> 01:37:21.229
They're trying to kill us.

01:37:21.230 --> 01:37:23.169
- Tommy, how do you know that?

01:37:23.170 --> 01:37:24.559
- Dressing all black?

01:37:24.560 --> 01:37:26.439
Come on, Charlie.

01:37:26.440 --> 01:37:28.889
They're definitely the killers.

01:37:28.890 --> 01:37:30.169
- How do you know when they came by?

01:37:30.170 --> 01:37:31.869
I opened the door, not you.

01:37:31.870 --> 01:37:36.549
- I saw them through the
window walk around the house!

01:37:36.550 --> 01:37:38.889
- Why didn't you say anything, Tommy?

01:37:38.890 --> 01:37:41.529
- Why you asking me a
million questions, Charlie?

01:37:41.530 --> 01:37:42.829
I'm your brother.

01:37:42.830 --> 01:37:44.339
- I'm sorry Tommy, it's just been

01:37:44.340 --> 01:37:46.040
so crazy, I don't know what to do.

01:37:47.370 --> 01:37:48.567
Come here, man.

01:37:52.245 --> 01:37:53.780
- He's dead, mama!

01:37:53.781 --> 01:37:54.912
- What are you doing?

01:37:54.913 --> 01:37:57.461
- He awful dead, everyone's dead!

01:38:01.386 --> 01:38:03.053
- No, baby!

01:38:04.453 --> 01:38:06.120
- It's over, Tanash.

01:38:07.510 --> 01:38:09.179
- I let y'all find me.

01:38:09.180 --> 01:38:10.180
You know why?

01:38:11.070 --> 01:38:12.070
- Why?

01:38:12.880 --> 01:38:16.763
- Because these humans
on Earth are so weak.

01:38:18.900 --> 01:38:20.383
- Let's end this!

01:38:21.980 --> 01:38:24.730
- Miss, please take your
child out right now and leave!

01:38:25.917 --> 01:38:27.738
- Come on mom, come on, let's go!

01:38:27.739 --> 01:38:28.739
- No!

01:38:30.161 --> 01:38:31.577
- Bye, mama.

01:38:31.578 --> 01:38:33.198
- Mom, we have to go!

01:38:33.199 --> 01:38:34.574
Mom!

01:38:34.575 --> 01:38:37.801
Come on mom, we have to go, mom!

01:38:37.802 --> 01:38:39.313
- Bye, son.

01:38:39.314 --> 01:38:40.314
- Mom, come on!

01:38:44.428 --> 01:38:45.804
- Let's do it.

01:39:22.695 --> 01:39:25.195
- We gonna be all right, mama?

01:39:32.644 --> 01:39:34.144
- It's not Tanash.

01:39:36.611 --> 01:39:39.202
- We're gonna be just fine.

01:40:19.720 --> 01:40:21.269
- I know.

01:40:21.270 --> 01:40:22.323
- I was close.

01:40:25.700 --> 01:40:28.993
- The important thing
is that you are alive.

01:40:30.190 --> 01:40:31.293
- He'll come after us.

01:40:32.450 --> 01:40:33.450
I know him.

01:40:46.544 --> 01:40:48.044
Let's finish this.
