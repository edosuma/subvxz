WEBVTT

00:04.072 --> 00:06.207
(LAUGHS)
Look at you.

00:06.240 --> 00:09.243
You did that thing where you
forgot it's the weekend.

00:09.277 --> 00:11.579
Oh, no, is it Friday?
I don't want to go to work.

00:11.612 --> 00:13.447
Ken, Ken, it's Saturday.

00:13.481 --> 00:15.449
Oh. Thank God.

00:15.483 --> 00:17.685
What a roller coaster.

00:17.718 --> 00:19.753
I'm just going in to see
a couple patients.

00:19.787 --> 00:22.022
You know how busy
the holidays are
for therapists.

00:22.056 --> 00:24.092
Add to that everything
I have to do around here.

00:24.125 --> 00:25.359
I feel you.
I just wish I could

00:25.393 --> 00:27.461
lighten your load
a little without, you know,

00:27.495 --> 00:29.830
actually doing anything.

00:29.863 --> 00:31.699
Well, we're off
to the library.

00:31.732 --> 00:34.468
Time for Dave to learn
the Dewey Decimal System.

00:34.502 --> 00:36.770
Oh.
So it's 1938?

00:36.804 --> 00:38.172
(LAUGHS)

00:38.206 --> 00:39.907
You laugh, but when
the grid goes down

00:39.940 --> 00:41.342
and there's
no more Internet,

00:41.375 --> 00:43.177
don't ask me to help
you find books.

00:45.045 --> 00:46.647
Okay, you guys.
This is it.

00:46.680 --> 00:49.150
I'm about to send
my application to Stanford.

00:49.183 --> 00:51.185
Oh! This is
so exciting!

00:51.219 --> 00:52.553
Attagirl.
Yep.

00:52.586 --> 00:55.356
Once I hit this button,
there's no turning back.

00:55.389 --> 00:58.492
Well, technically,
Stanford can turn you back.

00:59.427 --> 01:01.529
Don't listen to him,
honey.

01:01.562 --> 01:02.696
You've got nothing
to worry about.

01:02.730 --> 01:03.831
Yeah, you retook the SATs

01:03.864 --> 01:05.899
and brought them up
to Hugh Jackman level.

01:05.933 --> 01:08.336
You know, not perfect,
but "Damn!"

01:10.304 --> 01:12.473
So, here we go.

01:16.244 --> 01:18.646
Am I sending it too early?

01:18.679 --> 01:20.381
I hate to be
on the top of the pile.

01:20.414 --> 01:22.116
You always throw out
the first pancake.

01:22.150 --> 01:23.784
I'm not sure
it works that way.

01:23.817 --> 01:25.186
Yeah, when your mom
makes pancakes,

01:25.219 --> 01:26.787
we sometimes throw out
all of them.

01:27.688 --> 01:29.923
Really? Now?
Pick your moments.

01:31.192 --> 01:32.293
Okay.

01:35.429 --> 01:36.864
Hello, future.

01:36.897 --> 01:38.732
Ah! Oh, no.

01:38.766 --> 01:40.834
I hit the semicolon.

01:40.868 --> 01:42.270
Think it's a sign
that I should wait?

01:42.303 --> 01:43.704
(KEYBOARD CLICKS)
Taking too long.

01:43.737 --> 01:45.473
Good luck.
Let's go.

01:53.714 --> 01:56.284
Fudge?
Oh, thank you.

01:56.317 --> 01:58.919
If she can get here
by 10:00, I'll see her.

01:58.952 --> 02:00.053
Fine, I'll hold.

02:00.087 --> 02:01.922
Hey, Allison, you want to
try my vegan fudge?

02:01.955 --> 02:03.491
No time.
Super slammed today.

02:03.524 --> 02:05.759
Wow, who doesn't
want vegan fudge?

02:05.793 --> 02:07.595
Anybody with a mouth.

02:08.061 --> 02:09.129
Ugh.

02:10.464 --> 02:13.133
By the way, I am
the bearer of sad tidings.

02:13.167 --> 02:14.568
Due to
budgetary constraints,

02:14.602 --> 02:16.737
the Welltopia holiday party
has been canceled.

02:16.770 --> 02:18.339
Oh. Come on.
Son of a barley!

02:18.372 --> 02:21.475
Hey, don't blame me.
I'm only the messenger.

02:21.509 --> 02:23.844
And the guy
who canceled it.

02:23.877 --> 02:25.879
Well, at least we still
have secret Santa.

02:25.913 --> 02:27.147
Allison, you in?

02:27.181 --> 02:28.382
Oh, I don't know
if I'll have time.

02:28.416 --> 02:30.784
It's all right. We knew you
weren't gonna do it anyway.

02:30.818 --> 02:32.220
Yeah, no problem.

02:32.253 --> 02:35.088
I mean, as they say,
the less, the merrier.

02:37.391 --> 02:39.627
Oh! Speaking of
Christmas shopping,

02:39.660 --> 02:41.195
I haven't gotten
Eric's present yet.

02:41.229 --> 02:43.030
Oof, I am in
the same boat with Connor,

02:43.063 --> 02:44.598
and it is so stressful.

02:44.632 --> 02:46.700
Bam! Sweater.

02:46.734 --> 02:50.304
(LAUGHS) I've had my eye
on this bad boy for weeks.

02:50.338 --> 02:52.340
It's one of those big
snuggly fisherman sweaters.

02:52.373 --> 02:54.107
Okay, it's mostly
for me to wear.

02:55.008 --> 02:57.110
But he gets to
see me in it.

02:58.045 --> 03:00.381
I should get him
that bra I want.

03:01.649 --> 03:03.784
I wish it was that easy
to buy for Connor.

03:03.817 --> 03:06.387
Yeah, his gifts are so much
better than mine.

03:06.420 --> 03:08.456
Last Easter,
I got him candy.

03:08.489 --> 03:09.723
Like, candy, right?

03:09.757 --> 03:14.462
He adopted, in my name,
100 live bunnies,

03:14.495 --> 03:16.797
rescued from
children's Easter baskets,

03:16.830 --> 03:19.767
and paid for them to
live out their days

03:19.800 --> 03:22.236
happily frolicking
at Camp Nibbles.

03:23.771 --> 03:26.073
It's like he reads my soul.

03:26.106 --> 03:28.342
Yeah, that sounds
like voodoo.
I don't like that.

03:37.017 --> 03:40.153
14 patients
in 8 1/2 hours.

03:40.187 --> 03:42.823
Wow, that's a lot of neediness
for one person to absorb.

03:43.791 --> 03:44.925
I'm used to it.

03:44.958 --> 03:46.294
(LAUGHS)

03:46.327 --> 03:49.062
Yeah, I'm a handful.

03:49.096 --> 03:51.799
Hey, you know how Welltopia
canceled the holiday party?

03:51.832 --> 03:53.967
I was thinking
we should host it.

03:54.001 --> 03:56.370
What?
No. Why?

03:56.404 --> 03:58.639
'Cause everyone here
sees me as all business.

03:58.672 --> 03:59.940
You are.

03:59.973 --> 04:02.376
They assumed I wasn't
gonna do secret Santa.

04:02.410 --> 04:03.977
You weren't.

04:04.011 --> 04:07.448
I just want them to see
that worker bee Allison
isn't the whole story.

04:07.481 --> 04:09.116
But it is.

04:09.149 --> 04:11.952
Seriously, I want them
to see fun Allison.

04:13.220 --> 04:17.157
Yeah, I remember her
from before we got married.

04:17.190 --> 04:20.694
I know you're fun,
but I also know you take
on too much.

04:20.728 --> 04:23.263
You need to use this
week off to recharge.

04:23.297 --> 04:25.599
I know you think a party
will be more work,

04:25.633 --> 04:27.868
but I promise
I'll take care of everything.

04:27.901 --> 04:29.703
Sure, but who's gonna
take care of you?

04:29.737 --> 04:32.740
Me, by shutting down
this party idea.

04:33.907 --> 04:35.976
Allison, you have a walk in.
You want to take her?

04:36.009 --> 04:37.711
No, no.
She doesn't want to take...

04:37.745 --> 04:39.813
It's okay, I'll see her.
Oh, Damona.

04:39.847 --> 04:41.615
The holiday party's back on.

04:41.649 --> 04:42.816
Ken and I are gonna host it.

04:42.850 --> 04:45.819
Thanks, Dr. Ken!
You are the best!

04:45.853 --> 04:47.254
Actually, it was my idea.

04:47.287 --> 04:49.523
I have ideas like that
all the time.

04:49.557 --> 04:51.392
Yeah, it's gonna be fun.

04:51.425 --> 04:53.827
Bring Eric,
assuming he likes fun.

04:54.662 --> 04:55.763
Okay.

05:02.102 --> 05:06.006
So, the librarian
asked you to play Santa
for the kids' party?

05:06.039 --> 05:07.207
Why?

05:07.240 --> 05:08.442
Isn't it obvious?

05:08.476 --> 05:10.277
Because I'm so jolly.

05:11.745 --> 05:13.614
Do the laugh, Grandpa.

05:14.214 --> 05:15.749
(STERNLY) Ho.

05:17.418 --> 05:18.886
And Dave will be my elf.

05:18.919 --> 05:21.489
It's just a question of
which elf costume I wear.

05:21.522 --> 05:23.391
Am I Legolas from
Lord of the Rings

05:23.424 --> 05:25.158
or Dobby from
Harry Potter?

05:26.694 --> 05:28.195
Don't nerd this up.

05:28.228 --> 05:30.598
You're a regular
North Pole elf, okay?

05:30.631 --> 05:32.733
Sure, if you want
to lean into the cliche.

05:34.402 --> 05:36.970
So, what are you gonna wear
to our party on Friday?

05:37.004 --> 05:39.072
Jeans and a cute top,
but with a different

05:39.106 --> 05:41.008
house over it,
'cause I'll be at Tammy's.

05:42.476 --> 05:43.911
She's having people over.

05:43.944 --> 05:45.979
Ooh, Allison, you can't
compete with that.

05:46.013 --> 05:47.481
Tammy's parents
have a hot tub.

05:47.515 --> 05:49.049
We're not canceling.

05:49.082 --> 05:51.051
(SIGHS) It started as just
people from work.

05:51.084 --> 05:52.620
Now they're all bringing
plus-ones.

05:52.653 --> 05:54.422
Even Pat scared up a friend.

05:54.455 --> 05:55.556
Who's he bringing?

05:55.589 --> 05:58.526
I don't know.
Curt something.

05:58.559 --> 06:00.961
Hang on, you mean his friend
Curt from high school?

06:00.994 --> 06:04.832
I guess. I can't imagine Pat
having more than one friend.

06:04.865 --> 06:07.668
That guy is, like,
the Dean of Admissions
at Stanford.

06:07.701 --> 06:10.404
Mom, uninvite them.
We can't risk having a party

06:10.438 --> 06:12.406
that isn't up to
Stanford standards.

06:12.440 --> 06:15.008
Stanford's not gonna
reject you because your mom

06:15.042 --> 06:18.512
threw a bad party,
and I'm not gonna throw
a bad party.

06:19.713 --> 06:20.948
I'm fun.

06:22.049 --> 06:24.685
But are you
Stanford-caliber fun?

06:24.718 --> 06:26.754
Can you throw a party
worthy of Google co-founder

06:26.787 --> 06:28.889
Larry Page
or actress Sigourney Weaver?

06:28.922 --> 06:30.958
We're gonna have
meatballs.

06:32.460 --> 06:34.394
Well, there's always
community college.

06:40.801 --> 06:42.603
(DOORKNOB RATTLING)

06:49.743 --> 06:51.612
Hey, hon, need a hand?

06:53.146 --> 06:56.717
Actually, I do have one
party-related job for you.

06:56.750 --> 06:59.553
You realize "need a hand's"
just an expression, right?

06:59.587 --> 07:02.355
Okay, I know you're not
on board with the party,

07:02.389 --> 07:04.925
but maybe that would change
if you became

07:04.958 --> 07:06.460
the party entertainment.

07:06.494 --> 07:08.562
(GASPS) Comedy?

07:08.596 --> 07:10.297
I was thinking
more Christmas music.

07:10.330 --> 07:11.799
Oh, my God.

07:11.832 --> 07:14.134
Really? Ooh!

07:14.167 --> 07:16.504
I mean, everyone already
knows me for my stand-up.

07:16.537 --> 07:17.938
Everybody?

07:17.971 --> 07:19.306
(CHUCKLES)

07:19.339 --> 07:23.210
Just watch their jaws drop
when I tickle these ivories.

07:24.478 --> 07:28.849
* Moe Tannenbaum,
Moe Tannenbaum

07:28.882 --> 07:32.653
* The head of radiology

07:34.988 --> 07:36.456
Make sure we invite Moe.

07:36.490 --> 07:39.126
Oh, there's always
this Christmas classic.

07:39.159 --> 07:43.731
* Jingle bells, Batman smells,
Robin laid an... *

07:43.764 --> 07:45.298
(LAUGHS)

07:45.332 --> 07:47.901
I don't think I'll be able
to get through that one.

07:47.935 --> 07:49.903
(LAUGHING)
Oh, my God.

07:49.937 --> 07:51.605
* Jingle...
Nope.

07:55.676 --> 07:57.344
Come here for a second.
I need your opinion.

07:57.377 --> 07:58.846
What's up?

07:58.879 --> 08:00.714
Connor's Christmas gift.

08:00.748 --> 08:02.415
What do you think?

08:03.551 --> 08:05.719
The Complete Works
of Walt Whitman

08:05.753 --> 08:08.055
and the biography
of Ruth Bader Ginsberg.

08:08.088 --> 08:09.289
Uh-huh, yeah.

08:09.322 --> 08:12.660
Because he loves the phrase
"poetic justice."

08:12.693 --> 08:13.761
Huh?

08:16.830 --> 08:18.298
Okay, poetic.

08:19.533 --> 08:20.768
Justice.

08:22.870 --> 08:25.839
(SIGHS) I know.
It's terrible.

08:25.873 --> 08:28.008
I just... I'm trying to do
what he does and be personal

08:28.041 --> 08:30.143
and clever,
and it is hopeless.

08:30.177 --> 08:32.279
Don't worry about trying
to top what he gets you.

08:32.312 --> 08:33.881
I just... I really
want to make this Christmas

08:33.914 --> 08:35.082
special for him.

08:35.115 --> 08:37.084
He's not working right now,
and he can't afford

08:37.117 --> 08:39.887
to fly home to Virginia
to see his mom,
who, fun fact,

08:39.920 --> 08:41.254
is also named Virginia.

08:41.288 --> 08:44.658
Yeah. And Connor is
very attached to Virginia.

08:44.692 --> 08:45.859
His mother, not the state.

08:45.893 --> 08:47.427
The state he could take
or leave, which he did.

08:47.460 --> 08:50.564
But he's sad about
not seeing her, and I just...

08:50.598 --> 08:51.765
just wanted
to cheer him up.

08:51.799 --> 08:53.634
Okay, well,
there's your gift.

08:53.667 --> 08:56.469
Fly Connor's mom
out for Christmas.

08:57.204 --> 08:59.873
(SCOFFS)
That's amazing.

08:59.907 --> 09:01.274
(LAUGHS)

09:01.308 --> 09:03.677
Yeah, yeah, I'll... I'll...
I'll get her here
Friday night,

09:03.711 --> 09:06.146
and I'll present her
to Connor at the party.

09:06.179 --> 09:08.315
Yeah!
It's so good!

09:12.219 --> 09:14.655
Well, time to go
spread some cheer.

09:15.623 --> 09:17.424
We went traditional
with our costumes,

09:17.457 --> 09:20.794
except Grandpa refuses
to wear the belly.

09:20.828 --> 09:23.396
Morbidly obese Santa
is a bad role model

09:23.430 --> 09:25.465
for lazy American kids.

09:25.498 --> 09:27.400
Bowl full of jelly?

09:27.434 --> 09:29.569
I don't think so.
Let's go.

09:31.872 --> 09:32.973
Okay.

09:33.006 --> 09:35.475
Figured out what
I'm gonna open with tonight.

09:35.508 --> 09:37.611
Wait, what's
happening here?

09:38.646 --> 09:39.847
Is Dad playing at the party?

09:39.880 --> 09:43.316
* Deck the halls with
boughs of copays *

09:43.350 --> 09:44.852
Am I right?
Am I right?

09:45.819 --> 09:47.688
(LAUGHS)
It's a medical audience.

09:47.721 --> 09:49.522
It'll kill.

09:49.556 --> 09:52.826
Dad, I will give you $1,000
not to play tonight.

09:52.860 --> 09:53.961
Sweet, paid gig.

* Fa, la, la, la,
la, la, la, la *

09:56.263 --> 09:58.632
Ken, Ken!
Did you forget to buy ice?

09:58.666 --> 10:00.300
I've been working
on my music, Allison.

10:00.333 --> 10:02.502
I mean, you don't ask
Yo-Yo Ma to put out

10:02.535 --> 10:05.305
a bunch of folding chairs
for his concerts.

10:05.338 --> 10:06.907
That's more than fair.

10:06.940 --> 10:08.475
Go buy ice.

10:08.508 --> 10:11.411
Fine, but if my fingers get
numb, that's on you, girl.

10:11.444 --> 10:12.646
(KNOCK ON DOOR)

10:12.680 --> 10:13.981
(CELL PHONE RINGS)

10:16.049 --> 10:17.785
Hi!
Merry Christmas!

10:17.818 --> 10:19.653
Happy holidays!
Come on in.

10:19.687 --> 10:20.921
Hello. Just a sec.

10:20.954 --> 10:23.323
Make yourselves at home,
everyone, and tonight,

10:23.356 --> 10:25.458
drink responsibly means
your responsible

10:25.492 --> 10:26.694
for helping finish all of it.

10:26.727 --> 10:28.061
(LAUGHS)

10:28.395 --> 10:29.629
I'm fun.

10:31.431 --> 10:32.733
Yeah, what's going on?

10:32.766 --> 10:34.768
Happy holidays,
young Park.

10:34.802 --> 10:36.136
And thanks
for inviting me.

10:36.169 --> 10:39.039
Uh-huh, yeah.
Where's the Stanford guy?

10:39.072 --> 10:41.909
Curt said he'd meet me here,
to which I quipped,

10:41.942 --> 10:43.276
"You already know me."

10:45.378 --> 10:46.479
I didn't think you had
to be there.

10:46.513 --> 10:47.881
I guess I was wrong.

10:49.082 --> 10:50.217
Hey.

10:50.250 --> 10:51.785
I'll be back
in two minutes.

10:51.819 --> 10:54.154
One of our patients
just attempted suicide.

10:54.187 --> 10:55.288
What?

10:58.058 --> 10:59.326
(SIGHS)

11:00.694 --> 11:02.495
It's Gary Fleiss.
He's at the hospital.

11:02.529 --> 11:03.864
Acetaminophen overdose.

11:03.897 --> 11:05.465
I just saw him.
Is he stable?

11:05.498 --> 11:08.001
Yes.
I've been treating him
for depression,

11:08.035 --> 11:10.603
but I never thought...
I better go.

11:10.637 --> 11:12.405
Look, I know it's
your instinct to go,

11:12.439 --> 11:15.275
but even still, you're
entitled to a night off.

11:15.308 --> 11:16.509
Gary needs me.

11:16.543 --> 11:18.746
Okay, this is what I mean
about burning yourself out.

11:18.779 --> 11:21.314
Patient care suffers
when doctors over work.

11:21.348 --> 11:23.450
It also suffers
when they don't show up.

11:23.483 --> 11:25.786
But you're part of
the Welltopia team now.

11:25.819 --> 11:28.488
Dr. Mendlove is on call.
Let him take care of it.

11:28.521 --> 11:30.891
Mendlove doesn't know Gary
as well as I do.

11:30.924 --> 11:32.993
He doesn't
just need a doctor.

11:33.026 --> 11:34.694
He needs a friend.

11:38.531 --> 11:40.067
(DOOR CLOSES)

11:51.544 --> 11:54.181
His name is Lucas,
and he wants a Pokemon.

11:54.214 --> 11:56.049
Santa will bring you
a ball.

11:56.083 --> 11:57.184
Next.

11:59.486 --> 12:01.488
Santa, I want
Call of Duty IV.

12:01.521 --> 12:03.256
Video game?
No.

12:03.290 --> 12:04.557
Santa will bring you
a ball.

12:04.591 --> 12:07.327
Run around outside,
get exercise. Next.

12:09.096 --> 12:11.264
Does he even know
who Santa Claus is?

12:11.298 --> 12:13.066
It's anyone's guess.

12:15.969 --> 12:18.238
I don't know
what I was doing, Doc.

12:18.271 --> 12:20.573
Everything just felt
so overwhelming.

12:20.607 --> 12:23.243
Gary, I told you if it
gets like that, call me.

12:23.276 --> 12:24.377
You have my cell.

12:24.411 --> 12:26.079
Yeah, I should've.

12:26.113 --> 12:28.481
Instead I took
a handful of pills.

12:28.515 --> 12:30.517
I knew right away
it was a mistake,

12:30.550 --> 12:31.852
so I called the ambulance.

12:31.885 --> 12:33.821
I'm sorry for being
such a bother.

12:33.854 --> 12:36.389
It's no bother.
You're my patient.

12:36.423 --> 12:37.991
Hey, he's mine, too.

12:38.025 --> 12:40.193
Stop bogarting Gary, man.

12:40.227 --> 12:41.428
You came.

12:41.461 --> 12:43.696
Well, as a wise doctor
once told me,

12:43.730 --> 12:45.698
sometimes you don't
just need a doctor,

12:45.732 --> 12:47.167
you need a friend.

12:48.435 --> 12:50.871
So, do you have any
nausea or abdominal pain?

12:50.904 --> 12:53.740
Not anymore.
I think it's all
out of my system.

12:53.773 --> 12:56.443
And on the floor
of the ambulance.

12:56.476 --> 12:58.611
(LAUGHS)
Well, vomiting's good, Gary.

12:58.645 --> 12:59.813
It's the body's
way of saying,

12:59.847 --> 13:01.781
"Don't order sushi
in Bakersfield."

13:01.815 --> 13:03.283
(LAUGHS)

13:03.316 --> 13:05.652
His blood work and liver
function tests are normal.

13:05.685 --> 13:06.820
Oh, that's great.

13:06.854 --> 13:09.022
Okay, well,
we'll check these
again tomorrow

13:09.056 --> 13:11.158
and the next day,
but medically speaking,

13:11.191 --> 13:12.826
you're stable
and clear to go home.

13:14.094 --> 13:17.898
It doesn't feel
much like home anymore.

13:17.931 --> 13:21.668
It's been two years
to the day since
my wife passed away.

13:21.701 --> 13:23.470
It's tough enough
to lose someone,

13:23.503 --> 13:25.372
but when it happens
over Christmas,

13:25.405 --> 13:27.140
it's that much tougher.

13:27.174 --> 13:30.844
But thanks to you guys,
I'll be okay.

13:30.878 --> 13:33.780
Sorry to pull you away
from what seems like

13:33.813 --> 13:35.682
it was a nice evening.

13:38.952 --> 13:40.587
Well, they did
clear you to leave,

13:40.620 --> 13:43.423
but that doesn't mean
you have to go home.

13:45.525 --> 13:47.127
We're inviting you
to our party.

13:47.160 --> 13:49.362
Oh!
I did not get that at all.

13:50.363 --> 13:51.764
(CHUCKLES)

13:54.034 --> 13:57.004
All I really want for
Christmas is for my mommy
and daddy

13:57.037 --> 14:00.373
to love each other and to
stop fighting all the time.

14:00.407 --> 14:02.542
My name is Santa,
not Dr. Phil.

14:02.575 --> 14:03.877
You get a ball.
Next.

14:06.846 --> 14:09.316
My name's Erin,
and I don't want a ball.

14:09.349 --> 14:11.051
Okay, no ball.

14:11.084 --> 14:12.685
You get book.
Next.

14:12.719 --> 14:14.421
I like Sassy Cassie books,

14:14.454 --> 14:16.189
like Sassy Cassie's
Fashion Show.

14:16.223 --> 14:18.558
How about
Sassy Cassie Study's Math,

14:18.591 --> 14:20.928
Get High-Paying Job
in Tech Sector?"

14:20.961 --> 14:22.896
That book
doesn't sound fun.

14:22.930 --> 14:26.299
Fun? Lazy American kids
always want fun.

14:26.333 --> 14:29.236
U.S. children...
45th in reading
and math scores.

14:29.269 --> 14:31.438
How much fun is that?

14:31.471 --> 14:34.707
Okay, let's all thank Santa
for coming tonight.

14:34.741 --> 14:36.276
He needs to get back
to the North Pole.

14:36.309 --> 14:37.577
But there are
more children.

14:37.610 --> 14:39.079
Grandpa, read the room.

14:39.112 --> 14:40.313
Our work here is done.

14:40.347 --> 14:42.515
I don't get it.
What's the problem?

14:42.549 --> 14:44.151
Santa's not a gruff guy

14:44.184 --> 14:46.053
telling everybody
what they're doing wrong.

14:46.086 --> 14:49.422
He's about joy
and making people happy.

14:53.560 --> 14:54.661
Dave.

14:55.828 --> 14:56.930
Thank you.

14:56.964 --> 14:58.231
You get ball.

15:04.471 --> 15:06.339
Connor's mom's plane
landed two hours ago,

15:06.373 --> 15:08.708
and she took a cab
to the wrong address in
Canoga Park.

15:08.741 --> 15:10.944
Pssh! Old people.

15:10.978 --> 15:12.545
So, just send another taxi.

15:12.579 --> 15:13.813
That'll take forever.

15:13.846 --> 15:15.482
And Virginia
doesn't trust Uber.

15:15.515 --> 15:17.784
She thinks it's a form
of hitchhiking.

15:17.817 --> 15:19.987
Hey, young Park,
the caterers wanted me

15:20.020 --> 15:21.754
to pass on
a couple of messages.

15:21.788 --> 15:24.357
First, there's
no need to panic.

15:24.391 --> 15:27.260
Second, it'd be just super
if you happened to have

15:27.294 --> 15:28.628
a fire extinguisher.

15:28.661 --> 15:30.063
Oh, God!

15:30.097 --> 15:31.999
Yeah.
(FIRE ALARM BEEPING)

15:32.032 --> 15:35.102
I told you this sweater
looks better on me.

15:35.135 --> 15:36.869
Yeah, it does.

15:36.903 --> 15:38.071
I just would've worn
another layer

15:38.105 --> 15:39.339
if I'd known
you wanted it tonight.

15:39.372 --> 15:41.608
(CHUCKLES)

15:41.641 --> 15:43.510
Oh, hey, looks like
a whole string of lights

15:43.543 --> 15:45.312
are not plugged in.
Oh, plug them in, babe.

15:48.048 --> 15:49.716
(POPPING)
Oh! Oh!

15:51.351 --> 15:52.452
What happened?

15:52.485 --> 15:54.354
Mmm-mmm.
I ain't seen nothing.

15:56.056 --> 15:58.258
Okay, people,
I'm not beat yet.

15:58.291 --> 16:00.560
We're gonna pitch in
and pull this party together.

16:00.593 --> 16:02.996
Connor, go buy us
a big bag of ice.

16:03.030 --> 16:04.731
Okay.

16:04.764 --> 16:07.467
Damona, Pat, Eric,
can you go to the kitchen

16:07.500 --> 16:09.469
and help salvage
burned-up finger foods?

16:09.502 --> 16:11.838
Absolutely.
Can I get a jacket?

16:11.871 --> 16:13.173
Clark, organize the bar.

16:13.206 --> 16:16.076
Okay, but you need to give me
complete creative control.

16:17.877 --> 16:19.212
Grandpa!
Perfect.

16:19.246 --> 16:20.513
You're gonna drive
to Canoga Park

16:20.547 --> 16:23.116
and show Virginia
there really is a
Santa Claus!

16:23.150 --> 16:24.184
I don't know
what that means.

16:24.217 --> 16:27.554
Just start driving east.
I'll call you!

16:27.587 --> 16:30.790
Dave, you think
you can work some elfen magic
on the fuse box?

16:30.823 --> 16:32.692
I didn't win
three science fair ribbons

16:32.725 --> 16:34.361
based entirely on looks.

16:41.668 --> 16:43.203
Whoo!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

16:43.236 --> 16:45.672
Nice job, people.
Good work pulling it together.

16:45.705 --> 16:48.975
Ah, young Park.
This is my friend Curt.

16:49.008 --> 16:52.145
Curt, this is
Stanford University applicant

16:52.179 --> 16:53.280
Molly Park.

16:53.313 --> 16:54.514
Subtle.

16:56.049 --> 16:57.350
Nice to meet you.

16:57.384 --> 16:59.686
So, when did you get here?

16:59.719 --> 17:01.554
I came in
when the lights were out,

17:01.588 --> 17:03.490
and you were marshalling
the troops.

17:03.523 --> 17:04.791
Pretty impressive.

17:04.824 --> 17:05.958
Really?

17:05.992 --> 17:08.428
You know, we're not
a military school, per se,

17:08.461 --> 17:11.531
but we've graduated
400 generals and
military leaders.

17:11.564 --> 17:13.466
Mm-hmm. Not to mention
Richard Morningstar,

17:13.500 --> 17:15.735
former U.S. Ambassador
to Azerbaijan.

17:15.768 --> 17:17.704
You know,
to state the obvious one.

17:19.872 --> 17:21.741
Mom, Dad, you're back!

17:21.774 --> 17:23.743
The Stanford guy
is here.

17:24.511 --> 17:26.179
Oh, you must be Gary.

17:26.213 --> 17:27.880
My parents texted
you were coming.

17:27.914 --> 17:29.048
Glad you could join us.

17:29.082 --> 17:30.283
Me too.

17:30.317 --> 17:31.684
This party
looks great.

17:31.718 --> 17:33.186
Thanks.
I planned it.

17:33.220 --> 17:34.754
And I saved it.

17:35.488 --> 17:37.424
Thanks again
for having me.

17:37.457 --> 17:39.025
Happy holidays.

17:39.058 --> 17:40.793
Ooh! Meatballs!

17:45.265 --> 17:46.699
I'm glad we invited him.

17:46.733 --> 17:48.101
I'm glad you're awesome.

17:48.135 --> 17:49.602
You managed to
take care of patients

17:49.636 --> 17:51.838
and still throw
a kickass party.

17:51.871 --> 17:53.206
He's not lying, Allison.

17:53.240 --> 17:54.874
This is really fun.

17:54.907 --> 17:56.776
You hear that?
Yeah.

17:56.809 --> 17:58.978
Allison and fun
in the same sentence.

17:59.011 --> 18:00.147
(LAUGHS)

18:00.180 --> 18:01.881
Oh, hey, mistletoe.

18:01.914 --> 18:04.817
Oh, that's a cobweb
with a leaf stuck in it.

18:06.186 --> 18:08.054
Either way, coming in.

18:08.788 --> 18:10.657
Oh, everybody!
Eyes here.

18:10.690 --> 18:12.625
Okay, I have a little gift

18:12.659 --> 18:15.128
I would like to present
to my boyfriend, Connor.

18:17.297 --> 18:19.166
Merry Christmas, baby.

18:20.867 --> 18:22.034
(GASPS)

18:22.068 --> 18:24.204
Oh, my God!
Mom!

18:24.237 --> 18:25.705
Merry Christmas, honey.

18:25.738 --> 18:26.773
Oh.

18:27.507 --> 18:29.442
Hi!

18:29.476 --> 18:33.079
This is the sweetest,
most thoughtful gift
imaginable.

18:33.112 --> 18:35.047
Well, you know,
I guess there's a talent
to gift giving,

18:35.081 --> 18:36.616
and some of us have it.

18:38.318 --> 18:40.086
(SIGHS)
Thank you.

18:40.119 --> 18:41.921
And thank you.

18:41.954 --> 18:43.656
That's just
what Santa does.

18:47.260 --> 18:49.796
And, uh, this is
especially wonderful

18:50.863 --> 18:53.866
because Mom is here
to witness my gift to you.

18:54.201 --> 18:55.368
Oh.

18:57.604 --> 18:58.871
(GASPS)

19:02.575 --> 19:03.843
Clark...
(GASPS)

19:05.445 --> 19:07.647
My love, my everything.

19:10.750 --> 19:12.419
Will you marry me?

19:13.653 --> 19:15.355
Yeah.
Yes?

19:15.388 --> 19:17.390
I, I do. I will. Yes.

19:17.424 --> 19:19.326
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

19:20.092 --> 19:22.529
Damn it.
You beat me again.

19:25.565 --> 19:27.334
The party I planned.

19:30.937 --> 19:33.340
So, I was president of
the Spanish Club,

19:33.373 --> 19:35.808
Honors Society,
and I volunteered at
my parents' HMO.

19:37.043 --> 19:38.845
And I am so sorry
that charred octopus

19:38.878 --> 19:40.580
is a little over-charred.
Would you rather have sushi?

19:40.613 --> 19:41.748
I'd be happy to run
to Sugarfish.

19:41.781 --> 19:42.849
It'll just take 20 minutes.

19:42.882 --> 19:45.184
Molly, Molly, Molly,
hang on. Hang on.

19:45.218 --> 19:46.986
I appreciate
your enthusiasm,

19:47.019 --> 19:48.788
and you seem like
a wonderful person.

19:48.821 --> 19:50.690
But, you know,
this party can't be a factor

19:50.723 --> 19:53.593
in whether or not
you get into Stanford.

19:53.626 --> 19:55.362
Oh, of course not.

19:55.395 --> 19:57.430
But I have a good feeling.

19:58.097 --> 19:59.266
Good luck.

19:59.299 --> 20:00.533
Thank you.

20:00.567 --> 20:02.235
Thank you so much.

20:04.971 --> 20:07.206
I got a wink
and a "good luck."

20:08.207 --> 20:09.642
I got a wink
and a "good luck!"

20:09.676 --> 20:11.544
Whoo!

20:11.578 --> 20:16.516
* Have yourself
a merry little Christmas

20:18.184 --> 20:22.455
* Make the yuletide gay

20:22.489 --> 20:24.090
Already covered.

20:25.458 --> 20:32.432
* From now on, our troubles
will be miles away

20:35.435 --> 20:42.108
* Through the years,
we'll always be together

20:42.141 --> 20:45.678
* If the fates allow

20:48.481 --> 20:53.553
* Hang a shining star

20:53.586 --> 20:58.157
* Across the highest bough

20:58.190 --> 20:59.859
* Ooh

20:59.892 --> 21:01.928
* So

21:02.695 --> 21:04.263
* Oh

21:04.297 --> 21:07.467
ALL:
* Have yourself

21:07.500 --> 21:14.441
* A merry little
Christmas now *
