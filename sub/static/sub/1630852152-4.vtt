WEBVTT

00:02.420 --> 00:03.838
We have to call an ambulance.

00:03.879 --> 00:05.589
- No. We're leaving.
- He might be alive!

00:05.631 --> 00:07.633
He's dead. I checked, Felix.

00:07.675 --> 00:09.051
Then we have to call the cops.

00:09.093 --> 00:10.970
Can't you see the mess we're in?

00:11.011 --> 00:14.348
- If we don't leave, we're screwed.
- We didn't do anything, idiot!

00:14.390 --> 00:15.933
What'll you tell the police?

00:15.975 --> 00:18.644
- That we were buying seeds from a
narc? He's not a narc!

00:18.686 --> 00:19.937
He sold illegal marijuana!

00:19.979 --> 00:22.356
He's a drug dealer here
and in fucking Congo.

00:22.398 --> 00:24.066
Doll face, look at me.

00:24.108 --> 00:26.986
If they mix us up with this
they'll use my name

00:27.027 --> 00:29.071
- in all the papers.
- We didn't do anything!

00:29.947 --> 00:31.907
Any news about a Santamaría

00:31.949 --> 00:34.410
is a fucking bomb. Imagine this.

00:41.041 --> 00:42.626
We have to call the cops.

00:42.668 --> 00:45.004
Ignacio's right. He's right,
Felix.

00:45.045 --> 00:47.256
And what'll happen
when they find the body?

00:47.298 --> 00:49.467
Who'll find it?
We're in the boonies.

00:49.508 --> 00:51.177
Nobody knows we're here.

00:51.218 --> 00:54.346
Nobody knows. Look at me!

00:54.388 --> 00:57.141
We don't have to take the rap.

00:57.183 --> 00:58.642
We don't have to.

00:58.684 --> 01:00.644
Okay? We have to go now, Felix.

01:00.686 --> 01:04.023
C'mon, let's go now, Fefe.

01:04.064 --> 01:05.399
Fefe, enough!

02:07.628 --> 02:09.547
55% merlot,

02:09.588 --> 02:12.675
38% cabernet franc,

02:12.716 --> 02:14.969
7% cabernet sauvignon.

02:16.804 --> 02:17.805
I'll take this one.

02:24.770 --> 02:26.647
Are you coming with Ilana Frank?

02:26.689 --> 02:29.275
<i>The</i> <i>flight</i> <i>landed</i> <i>over</i> <i>an</i> <i>hour</i> <i>ago,
but</i> <i>she</i> <i>wasn't</i> <i>on</i> <i>it.</i>

02:30.234 --> 02:31.569
How come?

02:31.610 --> 02:34.280
I spoke with the airline
and they confirmed

02:34.321 --> 02:37.157
she took the morning flight.
But she's not at the airport.

02:37.199 --> 02:38.868
Then where is she?

02:39.451 --> 02:40.202
Wait a sec.

02:41.453 --> 02:45.040
I just got a message
with her GPS location.

02:45.875 --> 02:47.877
GPS location? Where?

03:00.139 --> 03:01.807
- Mariana?
- Yes.

03:04.059 --> 03:05.477
I wanted to come early.

03:07.187 --> 03:09.064
And I'd rather speak
Spanish here.

03:11.692 --> 03:13.861
What you have here is beautiful.

03:13.903 --> 03:15.946
Yes. Plants are my life.

03:18.073 --> 03:19.909
Aren't you too young
to say that?

03:20.659 --> 03:22.036
Well, I say it because

03:22.077 --> 03:24.496
I grew up among crops
and flowers,

03:24.538 --> 03:27.249
and now I live among cannabis.

03:28.667 --> 03:30.294
They're not too different.

03:30.336 --> 03:32.880
They are when one's celebrated
and the other's damned.

03:34.006 --> 03:35.883
That's in the past now.

03:35.925 --> 03:37.176
Sure.

03:37.217 --> 03:38.427
Tell that to my dad.

03:38.469 --> 03:41.430
He still blindly says
that some plants kill.

03:45.434 --> 03:48.979
How old are you?
Should you care what he thinks?

03:52.858 --> 03:55.903
For years, I wanted to
visit Colombia

03:55.945 --> 03:57.279
to see a coca lab.

03:57.321 --> 03:59.031
We're much more than that.

04:01.116 --> 04:03.869
I wanted to visit one of the labs
that was seized

04:03.911 --> 04:05.204
and is now being used
for culinary experiments.

04:06.914 --> 04:10.209
I wanted to see how people, after
growing coca for centuries,

04:10.250 --> 04:12.336
went back to working
with the product.

04:13.420 --> 04:14.922
How society
confronts the system.

04:15.673 --> 04:17.675
The way you are doing.

04:23.639 --> 04:26.016
It was a compliment,
in case you didn't realize.

04:29.228 --> 04:32.439
Let's continue? There's a lot we
want to show you.

04:32.481 --> 04:36.235
Are your partners here, or should I
start smoking and cancel the visit?

04:36.276 --> 04:38.529
No. They're waiting in
the board room.

04:38.946 --> 04:39.613
All right.

04:40.698 --> 04:44.618
Then let them wait a little more
while I make a couple of calls.

04:47.204 --> 04:48.414
Go ahead.

04:52.042 --> 04:53.919
<i>Moreover, Colombia
defines itself</i>

04:53.961 --> 04:57.047
as a leader in the worldwide
cannabis industry.

04:57.089 --> 04:58.132
An epicenter,

04:58.173 --> 05:01.385
where all types of
ventures coexist.

05:01.427 --> 05:03.303
And, in this ecosystem,

05:03.345 --> 05:04.763
KannaLab emerges

05:04.805 --> 05:07.516
as a disruptive player,

05:07.558 --> 05:09.560
due to one specific reason:

05:09.601 --> 05:12.479
we offer a product of
unbeatable quality,

05:13.230 --> 05:14.815
that can change lives.

05:14.857 --> 05:17.568
To sum up, KannaLab, and us,

05:18.902 --> 05:21.655
are the perfect complement
for New Soul Grass.

05:25.200 --> 05:27.745
And how exactly do you plan
to change lives?

05:28.662 --> 05:30.497
KannaLab is a different product,

05:30.539 --> 05:32.624
so it creates
different experiences.

05:35.085 --> 05:38.130
Tell me something I haven't read
in a Steve Jobs biography.

05:39.423 --> 05:41.008
I know you can.

05:42.301 --> 05:44.762
Our seeds are unique hybrids,
Ilana.

05:44.803 --> 05:47.598
They're like a one-to-one
female version of purpledia.

05:48.724 --> 05:49.725
Purplediol.

05:50.559 --> 05:54.772
The plants are harvested
about nine weeks after sowing.

05:54.813 --> 05:57.191
Their cannabinoid content is 30%

05:57.232 --> 05:59.318
CBD,

05:59.359 --> 06:04.364
and it has a cheerful, stimulating effect,
without increasing your heart rate,

06:05.616 --> 06:10.579
and its aroma is fruity
with a juicy hint.

06:20.172 --> 06:21.340
Exquisite.

06:22.341 --> 06:23.675
Without a doubt.

06:25.385 --> 06:28.138
But I wonder what's the
point of all this?

06:33.685 --> 06:34.978
What value does KannaLab offer?

06:37.397 --> 06:38.774
Freedom.

06:42.653 --> 06:46.406
Saying that a consumer has
freedom is blasphemous, isn't it?

06:54.498 --> 06:56.166
I see you have

06:56.208 --> 06:58.544
a well-structured business plan.

06:58.585 --> 07:00.546
A unique product.

07:01.505 --> 07:02.965
But nothing else.

07:06.218 --> 07:07.886
What else do we need?

07:08.929 --> 07:09.638
The most important thing.

07:10.889 --> 07:13.350
Why are you doing all this?
For the money?

07:13.392 --> 07:15.060
No, we're not here
for the money.

07:15.102 --> 07:16.186
Then, why?

07:17.146 --> 07:19.106
What does cannabis mean to you?

07:22.526 --> 07:23.861
It's the symbol of change.

07:25.487 --> 07:28.949
No, I mean you. What do you feel
when you smoke this cannabis?

07:31.785 --> 07:34.288
And don't tell me you
don't smoke.

07:37.374 --> 07:38.625
We're doing this

07:39.710 --> 07:41.420
because we want to
change the world.

07:45.257 --> 07:47.759
Seriously?
Do I look dumb to you?

07:50.220 --> 07:51.180
You don't like any answer?

07:52.097 --> 07:53.765
Just any answer isn't enough.

07:54.641 --> 07:56.351
We aren't just any company.

07:58.187 --> 08:00.564
Listen, tomorrow I have appointments
with two of your competitors.

08:01.940 --> 08:03.859
I don't have to ask them this
because they know.

08:04.735 --> 08:06.403
They're in it for the money.

08:06.445 --> 08:07.696
It's all they care about.

08:08.447 --> 08:09.781
Is it a noble vision?

08:10.574 --> 08:11.283
Not at all.

08:12.201 --> 08:14.328
But at least they know
why they're doing this.

08:15.454 --> 08:17.581
So, I wish you all the
best of luck.

08:23.128 --> 08:24.796
What the fuck was that?

08:27.132 --> 08:29.551
What're you doing, Nacho?
She said no.

08:29.593 --> 08:31.762
So? Are we gonna give
up that easily?

08:31.803 --> 08:33.305
You wanna put a gun to her head?

08:33.347 --> 08:35.140
Don't give him any ideas.

08:35.182 --> 08:37.392
The only thing you two ever negotiated
are your little secret smooches,

08:39.353 --> 08:43.523
but this is real life. What she just
did is a fucking negotiation strategy.

08:43.565 --> 08:45.567
A fucking negotiation strategy?

08:45.776 --> 08:48.528
This was a waste of time. It's
okay. We have to learn to lose.

08:49.655 --> 08:51.073
And we just sit back
and do nothing?

08:52.115 --> 08:53.116
We won't sit back
and do nothing.

08:54.201 --> 08:56.203
God, we tried
something different,

08:56.453 --> 08:59.581
another option, and it didn't work. It's
okay. We go back to the first option.

09:01.750 --> 09:05.796
No! I can't look at those fucking stock
photos with fake scientists in lab coats.

09:06.588 --> 09:07.589
Easy, don't look at them.

09:07.631 --> 09:08.632
Let's see.

09:10.467 --> 09:11.260
I'll ask you.

09:12.594 --> 09:14.805
Do you really want to work with
pharmaceuticals?

09:15.889 --> 09:17.266
Of course.

09:19.351 --> 09:20.644
- Yes.
- No.

09:21.770 --> 09:24.064
I know it's not easy,
but think first.

09:24.106 --> 09:25.107
I'm serious.

09:25.649 --> 09:28.360
'Cause this whole shit show
about changing the world,

09:28.402 --> 09:32.322
to end up working with people that
hog the market, store vaccines,

09:32.364 --> 09:36.368
and then sell them at the highest price
to dying people without other options.

09:36.410 --> 09:39.871
I don't get it. This was always the
plan, so why are you improvising now?

09:40.914 --> 09:41.999
Mariana, the plan
adapts to change.

09:43.292 --> 09:45.335
New Soul Grass is the business
of the future.

09:45.377 --> 09:47.838
Fucking pharmaceuticals
are dinosaurs of the past.

09:47.879 --> 09:51.300
The only thing we can do is bury them
for thousands of years,

09:51.341 --> 09:53.927
let them rot,
and drill their bones for oil.

09:53.969 --> 09:55.887
- That's what they're for.
- I agree...

09:55.929 --> 09:56.847
- Finally some sense!
- But New Soul Grass

09:56.888 --> 09:58.890
just blew us off!

09:59.141 --> 10:03.145
What can we do to make you understand,
to make you listen to reason, and focus?

10:03.186 --> 10:04.896
Are you aware of how
much time we have?

10:04.938 --> 10:07.441
Three months, not a day more,
to give Teo back his money

10:08.191 --> 10:10.193
or all of this is over.

10:10.235 --> 10:14.740
So Ilana, the pharmaceuticals, it'll all
be gone because we won't have seeds.

10:14.781 --> 10:18.535
We can't think about changing the world.
Sorry, we don't have any other choice.

10:18.577 --> 10:20.537
So what's your choice?
To shit yourselves?

10:20.996 --> 10:22.247
Fuck off.

10:24.708 --> 10:26.877
You really wanna work
with a pharmaceutical company?

10:28.587 --> 10:30.297
I don't trust Ilana anymore.

10:30.339 --> 10:33.925
You don't trust her because she
blew us off and your ego's fragile.

10:34.426 --> 10:35.093
Dude,

10:36.470 --> 10:39.348
you really wanna sell your soul
to a pharmaceutical company?

10:44.686 --> 10:46.772
I vote for the pharmaceuticals.

10:50.817 --> 10:52.361
Don't let me down.

10:53.570 --> 10:56.490
I know you have a bit
of common sense.

11:00.827 --> 11:02.162
I also vote for that.

11:13.340 --> 11:15.342
Who has the fragile ego now?

11:21.264 --> 11:22.391
You deserve each other.

11:23.600 --> 11:24.851
Why don't you fuck?

11:32.818 --> 11:35.695
Review the article to see
if we can publish it.

11:35.737 --> 11:36.696
Review it quickly.

11:37.614 --> 11:38.698
Am I interrupting?

11:38.740 --> 11:40.617
Since when do you care
if you interrupt?

11:40.659 --> 11:43.286
Apparently, I haven't treated you
with the respect you deserve.

11:43.995 --> 11:45.205
We're in a meeting.

11:45.247 --> 11:47.749
I'll be brief.
I have a topic for an article.

11:49.126 --> 11:50.877
Everyone liked the article
on your friend, right?

11:52.295 --> 11:55.173
Ignacio Santamaría.
My knowing him is irrelevant.

11:55.215 --> 11:58.468
Of the five companies with a permit
to grow cannabis in Colombia,

11:58.510 --> 12:00.512
four have been bought
by foreign capital.

12:00.554 --> 12:02.472
So those poor idiots at KannaLab
are the only national ones.

12:02.514 --> 12:04.599
So?

12:04.641 --> 12:08.687
It'll be just like all the country's other
resources. They'll be in foreign hands.

12:08.728 --> 12:10.814
I want a cover story
on the only Colombian company.

12:11.982 --> 12:13.692
You want to help KannaLab?

12:14.526 --> 12:16.153
No.

12:16.194 --> 12:18.697
I want to talk about the future
of cannabis from a local company.

12:19.406 --> 12:20.699
They'll be eaten alive.

12:20.740 --> 12:23.118
Shouldn't we talk about it
before that happens?

12:23.160 --> 12:26.163
You'll like it. I'll write an
award-winning story.

12:26.204 --> 12:29.958
You just have to put me in touch with
Silvia Granados. She's an expert.

12:31.209 --> 12:33.044
You won't stop
until you win an award, huh?

12:33.962 --> 12:35.797
You don't understand, Miguel.

12:35.839 --> 12:37.549
I'm unstoppable. Excuse me.

12:50.187 --> 12:51.938
You'll have more luck
with the labs.

12:51.980 --> 12:53.356
I'm not sure anymore.

12:54.399 --> 12:55.317
You always find a way, you know.

12:57.444 --> 13:01.615
- Aren't you being too optimistic?
- Everything I say can be used against me?

13:01.656 --> 13:04.826
Sorry. I can't stand
myself today, really.

13:07.787 --> 13:10.123
Do you want some music,
or can I tell you something?

13:11.082 --> 13:13.835
You can tell me.
I'm not an ogre.

13:14.920 --> 13:16.254
Your dad called me.

13:16.713 --> 13:18.048
Really?

13:18.089 --> 13:19.466
About your business together?

13:19.841 --> 13:20.759
No.

13:21.968 --> 13:22.969
To talk about you.

13:25.138 --> 13:25.847
What message does he
have for me?

13:26.932 --> 13:28.350
He didn't give me a
message for you.

13:28.934 --> 13:30.894
I know my dad.

13:30.936 --> 13:34.981
While we talked, the topic of making
amends came up.

13:35.023 --> 13:36.483
My dad wants to make amends?

13:36.525 --> 13:38.652
He didn't use those exact words.

13:38.693 --> 13:40.111
But that's basically
what he meant.

13:40.862 --> 13:42.280
What words did he use?

13:42.322 --> 13:44.032
Come on, Mariana.

13:44.991 --> 13:46.910
The words he used don't matter.

13:48.078 --> 13:49.162
Why do you always want to
find problems?

13:50.872 --> 13:55.085
What's important is that he's your
dad, and he wants to see you.

13:56.670 --> 14:01.007
Don't forget we don't all have a dad
to make amends

14:04.177 --> 14:06.221
with. You know how much I love you,
right?

14:08.682 --> 14:10.433
I'll remind you tonight.

14:29.911 --> 14:31.496
<i>I don't know what to
do with Eva.</i>

14:33.456 --> 14:35.792
<i>She still refuses to
restart treatment.</i>

14:38.461 --> 14:40.964
She hasn't said a single
word these days.

14:41.965 --> 14:43.466
Not even to argue.

14:44.259 --> 14:46.136
It's like she's given up.

14:49.014 --> 14:52.309
<i>I think it's time
to be clearheaded, Felix.</i>

14:53.560 --> 14:55.270
<i>Your mother can't go
on like this.</i>

15:16.416 --> 15:19.711
The seminogram shows a normal
concentration of sperm cells,

15:19.753 --> 15:22.631
without morphological
or motility abnormalities.

15:22.672 --> 15:25.508
The vaginal ultrasound
also doesn't show any problems.

15:26.926 --> 15:28.762
And the blood tests?

15:30.263 --> 15:31.139
Everything's fine.

15:31.931 --> 15:33.808
Then, what's the problem?

15:33.850 --> 15:37.062
There might be high levels of stress,
and that never helps.

15:37.103 --> 15:40.732
So it's important to stay calm
and be very patient.

15:42.984 --> 15:44.527
We can do that, right?

15:44.569 --> 15:45.904
Of course.

15:48.907 --> 15:50.075
Just a second.

15:51.493 --> 15:52.327
What's up?

15:53.036 --> 15:54.579
So, what happened?

15:56.331 --> 15:59.709
Mariana, one day your husband
will realize you're taking pills.

16:01.044 --> 16:01.670
Pills?

16:03.296 --> 16:06.049
Your blood estrogen and
progesterone levels are very high.

16:07.676 --> 16:11.596
I've already seen how this ends,
Mariana, and it won't end well.

16:13.473 --> 16:14.891
Where were we?

17:04.315 --> 17:05.608
Thank you for your time.

17:06.776 --> 17:08.027
Be quick. I have a meeting.

17:09.529 --> 17:12.073
I need information on cannabis
cultivation in Tayrona.

17:12.991 --> 17:15.160
Routes, territorial disputes?

17:15.201 --> 17:17.203
The origin of the cannabis plants.

17:17.537 --> 17:20.081
I'm investigating a company that says
they developed a plant in Bogotá,

17:20.999 --> 17:22.792
but I think it was in Tayrona.

17:22.834 --> 17:24.753
And what's the
problem with that?

17:24.794 --> 17:26.296
I want to know why
they're lying.

17:30.592 --> 17:32.427
You're Valeria's ex, aren't you?

17:33.762 --> 17:34.596
Yes.

17:39.058 --> 17:40.727
Is it a big company?

17:40.769 --> 17:42.020
No, it's small, independent.

17:43.146 --> 17:45.190
But it seems they have
the best seed.

17:47.484 --> 17:50.653
It takes time to
develop a good seed.

17:50.695 --> 17:53.448
To develop the best takes years
and a lot of research.

17:55.992 --> 17:58.244
Maybe they didn't develop it?

18:01.247 --> 18:04.667
Would you like to come to my house
later and talk more about this?

18:05.835 --> 18:07.420
I have to go back to
the newsroom.

18:11.257 --> 18:12.091
Okay.

18:13.218 --> 18:15.136
If the business
started in Tayrona,

18:15.178 --> 18:17.138
as you say, they probably bought

18:17.180 --> 18:21.976
the seeds from a militia
allied with the Mexicans,

18:22.018 --> 18:23.812
or the Israeli mafia.

18:23.853 --> 18:25.980
Those two mafias control
the market there.

18:26.981 --> 18:28.525
That business is very informal.

18:29.400 --> 18:30.652
In what way is it informal?

18:32.070 --> 18:32.779
You'll be late to the newsroom.

18:34.155 --> 18:36.991
Which, by the way,
Miguel checks on Monday morning.

18:37.033 --> 18:39.869
And today's Wednesday, 4 p.m.?

18:41.663 --> 18:43.039
Informal in what way?

18:44.999 --> 18:48.086
There aren't official procedures
to track the origin of a seed.

18:49.337 --> 18:50.421
But it can be done?

18:51.381 --> 18:53.174
If the seed's as
good as you say,

18:53.216 --> 18:57.512
whoever developed it
must have taken a long time.

18:57.554 --> 18:58.429
And that leaves a trail.

18:59.639 --> 19:01.641
If you want to get to the
bottom of this,

19:01.683 --> 19:03.810
look at the plant's genetics.

19:03.852 --> 19:06.062
That will give you your answers.

19:27.542 --> 19:30.086
Miss Journalist, how are you?

19:30.128 --> 19:32.130
<i>Mr.</i> <i>Santamaría,</i> <i>I'm</i> <i>fine,</i> <i>and</i> <i>you?</i>

19:32.380 --> 19:35.758
<i>If</i> <i>you</i> <i>want</i> <i>a</i> <i>break</i> <i>and</i> <i>some</i> <i>good
food,</i> <i>I'm</i> <i>making</i> <i>sushi.</i>

19:35.800 --> 19:39.762
I don't like sushi. I'm working
and I don't know when I'll finish.

19:39.804 --> 19:43.558
<i>Sure, it's very normal to call
just to say you're busy.</i>

19:44.934 --> 19:46.853
I have a question for you.

19:46.895 --> 19:48.271
<i>But just one.</i>

19:49.606 --> 19:51.649
I'm writing an article
on ventures related to

19:52.567 --> 19:54.402
<i>the national cannabis industry.</i>

19:54.444 --> 19:57.530
Oh, so you liked it?

19:57.572 --> 20:00.033
You'll be interested in this.

20:00.074 --> 20:02.535
I'm talking about a cover story.
Free publicity.

20:02.577 --> 20:03.661
Of course we're interested.
What do you need?

20:05.330 --> 20:08.541
I want to talk to your partners
and learn more about KannaLab.

20:08.583 --> 20:11.586
<i>Okay, but I warn you,
they're not as charming as I am.</i>

20:12.921 --> 20:14.923
Let me meet them
and I'll decide.

20:16.174 --> 20:18.968
Okay. I'll talk to
them tomorrow.

20:19.010 --> 20:19.636
<i>Perfect.</i>

20:20.803 --> 20:23.514
<i>That's all? You're
not coming over?</i>

20:23.556 --> 20:25.850
<i>If you don't like sushi,
you can have chicken.</i>

20:27.101 --> 20:27.644
That sounds good,

20:28.895 --> 20:31.314
but I have to finish my
game of solitaire.

20:34.525 --> 20:36.444
We'll talk later, then.

20:36.486 --> 20:38.947
<i>Yeah, we'll talk. Take care.
Bye.</i>

20:46.913 --> 20:50.208
GENETICS OF CANNABIS IN TAYRONA

23:26.864 --> 23:28.991
Fefe, what're you doing
here so late?

23:31.619 --> 23:33.913
I was checking that plant.

23:33.955 --> 23:35.498
It needs more nutrients.
And you?

23:37.125 --> 23:40.920
I came to drop off some stuff.
I'm ordering food. Want some?

23:42.088 --> 23:43.464
Okay, thanks.

23:59.897 --> 24:03.568
You never told Ignacio I turned down
the offer from Madre Verde, did you?

24:12.201 --> 24:13.911
Do you think I'm making
the right decisions?

24:15.496 --> 24:18.541
Only you can know that, Mari.
There'll always be problems.

24:18.583 --> 24:22.712
Stop bullshitting me, Fefe. I'm a
big girl. Tell it to me straight.

24:24.005 --> 24:26.632
The truth is you need
to relax a bit.

24:28.843 --> 24:31.846
With so much uncertainty,
I... just can't.

24:31.888 --> 24:34.265
No, do you think I can relax
with my mom?

24:35.641 --> 24:38.311
How can you always have
this zen outlook on life?

24:39.604 --> 24:41.314
Our star product...

24:42.940 --> 24:43.733
Really.

24:44.775 --> 24:49.238
I used to have acid reflux
because of the anxiety,

24:50.448 --> 24:54.076
and it completely vanished
with the weed.

24:54.118 --> 24:56.579
I swear, cannabis saved my life.

24:58.247 --> 24:59.290
- You could've told Ilana.
- About my reflux?

25:00.416 --> 25:02.043
To make her run out a
little faster?

25:11.093 --> 25:11.969
What?

25:13.638 --> 25:15.306
Hey, where'd you go?

25:17.808 --> 25:19.560
Back to the first time I
smoked a joint.

25:20.311 --> 25:21.312
It's been a few years.

25:21.687 --> 25:23.773
It fucked me up.
I even hallucinated.

25:24.398 --> 25:25.358
You hallucinated?

25:25.399 --> 25:26.359
It had acid in it.

25:26.400 --> 25:27.735
No, really.

25:27.777 --> 25:30.112
It can happen. It's because
of a genetic mutation.

25:30.780 --> 25:33.199
In the gene CHRM3.

25:33.241 --> 25:35.451
Gene CHMR...?

25:35.493 --> 25:37.161
Shit.

25:37.203 --> 25:39.872
You're the first person I've
known who's hallucinated on weed.

25:39.914 --> 25:43.668
It happens. I swear. I looked it
up. I'm surprised you don't know.

25:43.709 --> 25:45.336
Too much theory,
not enough practice.

25:47.421 --> 25:49.131
You'll have to try it
again someday.

25:51.092 --> 25:52.969
Maybe today.

25:54.762 --> 25:58.391
What happened to
"I don't want to lose control"?

26:00.559 --> 26:04.021
I dunno. If there's anyone I'd risk
losing control with, it's you.

26:05.314 --> 26:06.440
Not with your husband?

26:10.111 --> 26:11.195
Okay, then.

26:12.488 --> 26:13.281
I want to try it.

26:13.614 --> 26:15.408
- Now?
- Now.

26:15.449 --> 26:17.493
No way. You're drinking beer.

26:17.535 --> 26:18.911
What does that matter?

26:18.953 --> 26:21.539
You can't if you're drunk.
You could have a bad trip.

26:21.580 --> 26:24.500
I'm not drunk.
I only had two beers.

26:25.209 --> 26:26.794
I wanna try it now.

26:27.920 --> 26:28.879
You sure?

26:30.006 --> 26:31.674
It's now or never.

26:33.676 --> 26:35.011
Okay.

26:48.607 --> 26:50.985
When I see that, I can't
help thinking about Tayrona.

26:51.777 --> 26:52.862
Forget that. You're here.

26:54.030 --> 26:55.489
You're going to try our
best product.

26:56.741 --> 26:58.868
I swear there isn't
anything else like it.

26:59.410 --> 27:00.328
Okay.

27:15.551 --> 27:16.635
Okay.

27:16.677 --> 27:17.553
Easy now.

27:17.970 --> 27:18.804
Okay.

27:20.389 --> 27:24.060
Deeper, deeper. Through
the nose. Hold it.

27:25.811 --> 27:27.730
That's normal.

27:38.282 --> 27:39.617
It's smooth, isn't it?

27:39.658 --> 27:41.285
I want to feel the intensity.

27:44.121 --> 27:45.664
Okay, let's go.

27:48.626 --> 27:51.253
Let it in.

27:51.295 --> 27:52.880
Slowly.

27:53.381 --> 27:56.050
That's it.

28:02.014 --> 28:02.973
Are you okay?

28:03.015 --> 28:06.060
I don't know how I am.

28:08.771 --> 28:10.773
Open your eyes.

28:14.944 --> 28:17.530
Why didn't I try this sooner?

28:21.075 --> 28:23.035
I feel like I'm on a beach.

28:24.203 --> 28:25.121
You are on a beach.

28:27.498 --> 28:28.416
Hear the waves?

28:29.917 --> 28:30.960
Hear them?

28:32.002 --> 28:33.045
Well,

28:34.088 --> 28:36.674
I feel the wind, but
the waves...

28:37.508 --> 28:39.135
I owe you some waves.

28:49.061 --> 28:51.856
There's a mango in the fridge.
It'll help.

28:51.897 --> 28:53.357
- I'll be right back.
- Okay.

30:54.520 --> 30:56.021
We don't have to take the rap.

31:15.541 --> 31:18.085
Felix?

31:37.271 --> 31:39.815
Felix!

31:45.863 --> 31:47.489
Hey, what's wrong?

31:48.365 --> 31:48.907
What's wrong?

31:49.617 --> 31:50.618
Get me out of here.

31:50.659 --> 31:51.535
Of where?

31:52.661 --> 31:54.997
- Where'd we hide Assaf's body?
- What?

31:55.039 --> 31:56.040
Where is it?

31:56.081 --> 31:58.709
Come here, hey.

31:58.751 --> 32:01.462
Breathe. Look at me. Breathe.

32:02.838 --> 32:04.965
- You're having a bad trip.
- I'm breathing.

32:05.007 --> 32:08.802
- Relax, I'll get some pepper. It'll help.
- No, don't go.

32:10.679 --> 32:11.639
Where's Assaf?

32:13.098 --> 32:14.391
Can you please stop
saying that name?

32:15.142 --> 32:18.479
Felix. Someone's here.

32:18.896 --> 32:20.189
Where?

32:21.649 --> 32:23.609
Over there.

32:23.651 --> 32:25.653
- Mariana, it's just us--
- Please, Felix.

32:26.570 --> 32:28.822
Look under the plants.

32:28.864 --> 32:30.616
Look, please.

32:31.158 --> 32:31.992
Felix.

32:50.719 --> 32:51.679
Come.

32:54.139 --> 32:57.893
Nobody's here. Come here.

33:02.731 --> 33:04.108
Enough.

33:57.286 --> 33:58.704
Are you asleep?

33:59.663 --> 34:01.540
No, I'm here.

34:03.083 --> 34:04.960
But you're not asleep?

34:06.628 --> 34:09.339
Would I be talking if
I were asleep?

34:09.381 --> 34:11.842
I don't know. It could be
a hallucination.

34:11.884 --> 34:14.011
People don't
hallucinate on weed.

34:14.052 --> 34:16.889
What about the gene CHRM3?

34:18.223 --> 34:20.893
I think you need to stop
worrying about that gene.

34:26.690 --> 34:27.733
Hey,

34:30.194 --> 34:31.862
have you been avoiding me?

34:34.239 --> 34:35.657
No, why?

34:37.618 --> 34:38.535
I dunno.

34:39.995 --> 34:44.291
Ever since the open house,
you've been a bit distant.

34:49.797 --> 34:52.090
I just have a lot on my plate.

34:58.722 --> 35:00.265
I don't want to push you away.

35:11.819 --> 35:13.445
C'mon. I'll take you home.

35:16.990 --> 35:18.075
No.

35:21.662 --> 35:23.580
Can you take me
somewhere else first?

35:39.179 --> 35:40.430
How do you feel?

35:43.392 --> 35:44.226
Fine.

35:45.352 --> 35:46.979
Wouldn't you rather do
this tomorrow?

35:47.813 --> 35:49.314
I told him I was on my way.

35:49.356 --> 35:52.234
It doesn't matter. We can leave.
You can think it over.

35:52.276 --> 35:53.694
You can talk to him later.

35:56.029 --> 35:57.948
If I think too much,
I might not do it.

35:59.116 --> 36:01.410
Mari, I don't think this
is a good idea.

36:03.078 --> 36:04.288
You'll wait for me here?

36:05.581 --> 36:06.540
Of course.

36:37.112 --> 36:38.238
What's going on?

36:40.032 --> 36:43.493
I asked Mr. Arango
and Mr. Mendoza to be here.

36:44.661 --> 36:47.372
I came to talk with you,
not your lawyers.

36:47.414 --> 36:48.957
We're just going to talk.

36:50.667 --> 36:52.753
About what?

36:52.794 --> 36:53.962
Will you sit down?

36:54.004 --> 36:56.465
No. I'm fine here, thanks.

37:02.638 --> 37:08.018
I want to avoid any future issues, and
the only way to do that is in writing.

37:09.645 --> 37:12.856
All the board members at Rosalía
are worried about what happened.

37:14.524 --> 37:18.737
They're afraid you might decide
to take more land at any moment.

37:18.779 --> 37:20.072
I was clear with you.

37:20.781 --> 37:22.366
I already told you.

37:22.407 --> 37:25.285
I'll only use what I took for
the greenhouse. Nothing else.

37:25.327 --> 37:28.538
Then you won't have a problem
with signing the document.

37:35.295 --> 37:37.130
This isn't a good time.

37:37.172 --> 37:39.883
But you're already here.
You can read it.

37:40.342 --> 37:41.385
Sit down.

38:03.156 --> 38:05.867
You're asking me to give your
company all my land?

38:05.909 --> 38:08.453
Only the plots that
have flowers.

38:08.495 --> 38:10.497
I can't sign this.

38:10.539 --> 38:15.168
The board needs to know you won't have
another outburst and hurt the company.

38:15.210 --> 38:17.796
I'm not going to take anything.

38:17.838 --> 38:20.132
What else can I do to make
you understand?

38:20.173 --> 38:22.467
I'm not a threat, Dad.

38:22.509 --> 38:24.052
Then prove it.

38:45.449 --> 38:47.826
It's all the land Mom gave me.

38:47.868 --> 38:50.287
And Rosalía will still
be your company.

39:00.088 --> 39:01.465
You know...

39:02.591 --> 39:05.010
that flowers have been
your whole life.

39:06.094 --> 39:07.929
Don't destroy them.

39:18.440 --> 39:20.484
I need to think this over.

39:20.525 --> 39:23.862
The insurance company gave us
an ultimatum. They need to know

39:23.904 --> 39:28.241
that all our lands will
still be devoted to our crops.

39:29.034 --> 39:30.327
They'll find something.

39:30.368 --> 39:32.079
They'll find something?

39:32.120 --> 39:34.873
You're throwing away
your mother's company.

39:34.915 --> 39:36.625
This isn't her company anymore.

39:44.966 --> 39:47.177
I can't imagine...

39:49.554 --> 39:51.348
how ashamed she would be,

39:54.976 --> 39:56.269
your mother,

39:57.604 --> 39:59.564
if she saw what you're doing.

40:11.785 --> 40:15.705
Don't bring my mother into this.
She can't speak for herself.

40:21.586 --> 40:22.796
Mariana.

40:28.301 --> 40:29.427
You're going to sign.

40:31.388 --> 40:32.639
One way,

40:34.224 --> 40:35.684
or another.

40:37.769 --> 40:39.271
Now you're threatening me?

40:40.939 --> 40:42.858
Think whatever you want.

41:11.970 --> 41:14.890
Don't tell me you happened
to be jogging by here?

41:15.891 --> 41:19.394
No. I need to speak with you.

41:24.608 --> 41:25.775
- Hungry?
- No, thanks.

41:27.569 --> 41:30.363
I just want you to know I'm convinced
that we must work together.

41:35.118 --> 41:38.371
I thought you bet on KannaLab
because it's a unique opportunity

41:38.413 --> 41:40.290
to do something greater
than the rest.

41:43.460 --> 41:44.252
That's in every
entrepreneur's soul.

41:45.337 --> 41:46.379
Yes, but that's not
why I'm in it.

41:47.547 --> 41:49.507
I will repeat that,
but it's not true.

41:52.636 --> 41:56.348
It's one of the lies I've told myself
for 14 years, when my life changed.

41:58.225 --> 42:00.894
Look, I was driving one night.

42:00.936 --> 42:02.145
I was very drunk and going fast.

42:04.147 --> 42:06.691
Because the world was mine, I was in
control. But that night I hit a taxi.

42:08.360 --> 42:11.238
And my uncles in Congress and the
Senate covered it all up.

42:11.279 --> 42:14.491
They did everything in their power
so I wouldn't have to worry.

42:15.784 --> 42:17.035
But I do worry, you know?

42:18.620 --> 42:21.081
That drunk kid didn't deserve
to just walk away from that.

42:22.082 --> 42:24.167
He should've paid
for what he did.

42:26.127 --> 42:29.422
So KannaLab isn't here
to make money or be powerful.

42:29.464 --> 42:32.342
It's here to give me another
chance, to make things right.

42:35.512 --> 42:37.639
To stop being what the
past told me to be.

42:44.271 --> 42:45.605
So why cannabis?

42:49.776 --> 42:52.529
It's a plant that just wants to grow
and they won't let it.

42:58.702 --> 42:59.536
The car's ready.

43:01.955 --> 43:02.789
Thank you.

43:08.795 --> 43:12.007
How much cannabis oil can you deliver
to Canada in 28 days?

43:15.593 --> 43:16.761
50 liters.

43:34.070 --> 43:36.072
I'll send you the
contract tonight.

43:45.040 --> 43:45.915
Are you okay?

43:56.426 --> 43:58.386
What's that?

43:58.428 --> 44:00.972
Two tickets and a hotel
for you and Carmenza.

44:01.973 --> 44:03.725
The whole trip to
Italy's covered.

44:08.855 --> 44:10.565
Where'd you get the money?

44:12.776 --> 44:16.279
I talked with the lawyer
and there was a mistake.

44:16.321 --> 44:17.405
I got mixed up.

44:21.076 --> 44:22.327
You got mixed up?

44:36.257 --> 44:37.342
Will you be long?

44:38.426 --> 44:39.260
Hi.

44:40.261 --> 44:42.180
Uh, yes. A bit.

44:43.807 --> 44:44.641
Mari,

44:48.686 --> 44:50.355
I've been thinking...

44:51.856 --> 44:53.400
about what the doctor said.

44:56.444 --> 44:58.655
Why don't we spend a few
days at a spa?

45:00.407 --> 45:03.034
So we can calm down,
you can relax.

45:05.495 --> 45:07.580
- I'd rather change doctors.
- What?

45:09.999 --> 45:10.834
Why?

45:13.086 --> 45:14.879
I don't like her.

45:21.386 --> 45:23.138
She helped my sister a lot.

45:23.972 --> 45:25.390
She's the best there is.

45:27.308 --> 45:29.018
I don't feel
comfortable with her.

45:49.873 --> 45:52.125
<i>Was there anyone in the taxi?</i>

45:54.002 --> 45:55.503
<i>Just the driver.</i>

45:57.755 --> 45:58.840
What happened to him?

46:01.009 --> 46:02.135
Nothing.

46:03.970 --> 46:07.056
A few years ago, I used to park in
front of his house every week.

46:08.641 --> 46:11.436
<i>I watched him walking out
to throw away the trash,</i>

46:12.687 --> 46:14.439
<i>with the same blue trash bin.</i>

46:22.155 --> 46:23.656
We think we get over the past,

46:24.699 --> 46:27.160
but the past doesn't
get over us.

46:49.224 --> 46:50.767
NO RESULTS FOUND FOR
YOUR SEARCH.

47:39.315 --> 47:42.777
ISRAELI ASSAF DABBUR'S CORPSE
FOUND IN TAYRONA

47:47.407 --> 47:51.202
THE CORPSE SHOWS
EVIDENCE OF A MURDER
