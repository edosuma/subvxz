Considering we're so close
to capturing our white whale.

06:17.942 --> 06:19.596

reference.

06:22.686 --> 06:25.428

been able to capture

06:25.472 --> 06:27.169

Because you're the epicenter,

Sara died, which made

11:18.721 --> 11:20.288
Well, there's only one way

Guys, you're not listening

You're suggesting a total reset

What we need is
a surgical strike.

11:34.606 --> 11:36.783
Now, if we save Sara,

11:36.826 --> 11:38.741

Dez is de-demoned,

11:41.178 --> 11:42.310
Bob's your uncle.

11:42.353 --> 11:44.094
- I'm sorry, guys.

11:44.138 --> 11:47.576
I have to stop you before you
before you make this any worse.

11:47.619 --> 11:48.838
Ow!

11:51.275 --> 11:53.016
All right, then.

11:53.060 --> 11:54.496
I'm sorry, love.

11:54.539 --> 11:57.368
- Until you can learn
to stay out of my way,

11:57.412 --> 11:59.980
then you...

12:00.023 --> 12:03.157
- ...are a cat.

12:03.200 --> 12:04.724
- In the mood
for a prison break?

12:04.767 --> 12:07.248
- Oh, yes I am.

12:20.652 --> 12:22.611
- How much of that
did you hear?

12:22.654 --> 12:25.005
- Uh...
nothing at all.

12:25.048 --> 12:27.877
Nothing about breaking out
or hacking history.

12:27.921 --> 12:29.836
Please don't turn me into
a cat.

12:29.879 --> 12:31.228
- Well, I didn't turn her
into cat.

12:31.272 --> 12:32.534
I returned her to being a cat,

12:32.577 --> 12:34.231
which is considerably easier,
believe me.

12:34.275 --> 12:38.235
- But if you gotta,
maybe a Calico and real fluffy.

12:38.279 --> 12:40.150
Okay, I'm ready.
Do it.

12:40.194 --> 12:41.195
- What are we gonna do
with her?

12:41.238 --> 12:42.326
- I have no idea.

12:42.370 --> 12:43.327
- You don't have to do
anything.

12:43.371 --> 12:44.720
I wanna help.

12:46.243 --> 12:49.333
- The Custodians of the
Chronology must be stopped.

12:49.377 --> 12:50.900
They turned my Kaupe friend
into a rug.

12:50.944 --> 12:52.902
So if you're trying
to defeat them,

12:52.946 --> 12:55.949
I want in.

12:59.300 --> 13:01.084
Oy!
- Shh, someone might hear you.

13:01.128 --> 13:03.565
- Red Alert,
the "Waverider" is landing.

13:03.608 --> 13:04.784
Red Alert.

13:04.827 --> 13:06.176
- Oh, man,
the Custodians are here.

13:06.220 --> 13:08.352
Could things get any worse?

13:08.396 --> 13:10.833
- Wait, stop right there.

13:10.877 --> 13:13.270
Are you me?

13:13.314 --> 13:16.012
- Yes.

13:16.056 --> 13:17.274
From the future.

13:19.102 --> 13:21.452
Do I ever find love,
or at least my sunglasses?

13:21.496 --> 13:22.627
They might be
in my other pants.

13:22.671 --> 13:24.455
- Yes, Gary,
all that and more.

13:24.499 --> 13:25.717
[laser blasts,
glass shattering]

13:25.761 --> 13:27.241
- It's the Custodians!

13:27.284 --> 13:30.026
- But right now, I need you
to delay the Custodians.

13:30.070 --> 13:31.941
- Okay.
Oh, but be careful.

13:31.985 --> 13:34.030
There's been reports of
a shapeshifter on the loose.

13:34.074 --> 13:35.727
- Yeah, I know that already.

13:35.771 --> 13:38.513
Because I'm you
from the future, dummy.

13:38.556 --> 13:40.123
- Secure the prisoners.

13:40.167 --> 13:41.951
Lockdown protocols
have been activated. Hurry!

13:41.995 --> 13:43.126
- Okay.

13:43.170 --> 13:44.301
- Come on.

13:44.345 --> 13:45.825
We gotta find
a place to hide.

13:54.703 --> 13:56.792
- Come on, hurry up!
Let me out of this thing.

13:56.836 --> 13:59.055
Oh, God.

14:00.709 --> 14:02.537
- This is Ava's office,

14:02.580 --> 14:04.408
but she's gone.

14:06.062 --> 14:10.023
- I'm right here, you idiots.

14:10.066 --> 14:13.722
- Dad, we tracked
a shapeshifter here,

14:13.765 --> 14:15.158
so we're gonna need you
to stand down

14:15.202 --> 14:17.595
and let us our job
and bag it for you.

14:17.639 --> 14:20.163
- Your job, son,
is to bring the creatures

14:20.207 --> 14:21.948
back to the Bureau alive.

14:21.991 --> 14:24.646
Not leave their insides
strewn through history.

14:24.689 --> 14:26.822
- It's called payback for what
they did to Sara,

14:26.866 --> 14:29.042
and don't get in our way.

14:29.085 --> 14:32.523
What happened to you?

14:32.567 --> 14:34.612

in my own way.

14:34.656 --> 14:36.092
Why the hell are you out of
your cell?

14:36.136 --> 14:37.572

14:37.615 --> 14:39.966

Director Sharpe?

14:40.009 --> 14:41.619
- I'm fine!

14:41.663 --> 14:43.534
I'm just taking some time
to get my head together

14:43.578 --> 14:46.842
after Sara was unicorned.

14:46.886 --> 14:49.714
- I'm really sorry about that.

14:49.758 --> 14:51.629
Things are not as they seem.

14:51.673 --> 14:53.457

Well, it's a long story,
but time is--

14:55.546 --> 14:57.331
well, broken.

14:58.723 --> 15:00.073
- Well, you see,
you're living in a timeline

15:00.116 --> 15:01.944
that doesn't exist,
and we are from a timeline

15:01.988 --> 15:03.815

is still blonde.

15:03.859 --> 15:05.774

15:05.817 --> 15:07.645

15:07.689 --> 15:09.517

of the Chronology

15:09.560 --> 15:10.822
are actually
the Legends of Tomorrow

15:10.866 --> 15:12.694

mostly.

15:12.737 --> 15:15.697

Sara is supposed to be alive.

15:18.004 --> 15:19.309
both: Yeah.

15:19.353 --> 15:20.397

Now that should fix everything.

be a cat.

a crossed wired thing

Just chores, daily baths,

23:17.744 --> 23:19.876
church service each morning,

23:19.920 --> 23:23.967
and you must
start eating broccoli.

23:24.011 --> 23:25.882
- But I don't want all that.

23:25.926 --> 23:29.146
- Well, until our bond
is severed,

23:29.190 --> 23:32.062
I'm afraid that's
the way it must be.

23:32.106 --> 23:36.589

are right.

I think you've said

32:49.054 --> 32:50.359
quite enough today already--

32:57.018 --> 32:58.498
Why do you look like Amaya?

32:58.541 --> 33:02.850
- It is complicated,
but this is how you know me.

33:02.893 --> 33:05.505
What's happened to the Legends
to make you like this?

33:07.072 --> 33:10.031
- You guys are so intent
on killing magical creatures.

33:10.075 --> 33:13.078
Can't you see that
this is wrong?

33:16.907 --> 33:20.215
- Not really.

33:21.347 --> 33:23.044
- Look, now I know
this sounds crazy,

33:23.088 --> 33:25.438

speaking to upstairs

33:25.481 --> 33:28.354
is my past.

33:28.397 --> 33:31.357
- So you break up with me
out of the blue,

33:31.400 --> 33:34.099
act like a total ass,
and suddenly

33:34.142 --> 33:35.578
that's in the past,
just like that?

33:35.622 --> 33:38.842
- Listen, literally,
that is me from ages ago,

33:38.886 --> 33:40.714
but the person who's standing
in front of you right now

33:40.757 --> 33:43.891
is a little bit older
and he's a little bit wiser.

33:43.934 --> 33:46.415
- Sure.
Still playing games, clearly.

33:46.459 --> 33:47.938
Look.

33:47.982 --> 33:50.028
I thought this was real.

33:50.071 --> 33:52.117
- Yeah, it is real, Dez,
and that's why

33:52.160 --> 33:54.945
I moved heaven and earth
so that I could save you

33:54.989 --> 33:57.600
from a lifetime
and eternity of anguish,

33:57.644 --> 34:01.343
anguish that I caused.

34:01.387 --> 34:03.084
Look...

34:04.825 --> 34:07.567
I'm sorry you ever
even met me.

34:10.787 --> 34:14.095
- Don't be sorry.

34:14.139 --> 34:16.793
Only a fool would fall in love
in John Constantine

34:16.837 --> 34:19.970
and not expect it to be rocky.

34:20.014 --> 34:22.234

34:22.277 --> 34:26.238

- Sara, crazy-looking
Constantine

34:54.179 --> 34:55.528
just memory-flashed a civilian.

34:55.571 --> 34:56.572
Can we shoot him yet?

34:56.616 --> 34:58.008
- Wait for my signal.

34:58.052 --> 35:00.141
I'm dealing with a situation
on the ship.

35:00.185 --> 35:02.274
Constantine might be--

35:02.317 --> 35:04.928
Sara?

35:04.972 --> 35:07.017
- Hold on a second, Ray.

35:09.107 --> 35:10.934
- Look, I don't know
who you are,

35:10.978 --> 35:13.111
or why you are on my ship,

35:13.154 --> 35:15.678
but you're never leaving.

35:19.552 --> 35:21.728
- Oh, hello, handsome.

35:21.771 --> 35:24.339
What are you doing standing
in the middle of the street?

35:24.383 --> 35:27.734
- I was--

35:27.777 --> 35:29.997
You--you went to the market.

35:30.040 --> 35:31.520
- I did.

35:31.564 --> 35:33.740
- Next thing I know
I was standing in the street.

35:33.783 --> 35:36.395
I don't know.

35:37.613 --> 35:39.398
- Wait, Sara, please.

35:39.441 --> 35:40.703
Just tell me why

35:40.747 --> 35:43.880
you're so intent
on killing magical creatures.

35:43.924 --> 35:46.231
- Because that's how
we stay alive.

35:50.409 --> 35:52.062
Stop doing that!

35:52.106 --> 35:54.326
Don't you remember London?
- No.

35:54.369 --> 35:55.892
- When you and I first met

35:55.936 --> 35:58.765
and I helped you see the truth
about magical creatures.

36:02.203 --> 36:04.249
By showing you that
I'm not here to hurt humans.

36:04.292 --> 36:06.773
That not all monsters need
to be put down.

36:06.816 --> 36:09.515
- That's cute,
but never happened.

36:09.558 --> 36:10.907
- What--

36:10.951 --> 36:13.606
How can you not remember?

36:13.649 --> 36:15.085
Bollocks.

36:15.129 --> 36:16.565
Because of Constantine,
you and I never met

36:16.609 --> 36:20.090
and you never changed.

36:20.134 --> 36:21.483
I'm the missing ingredient

36:21.527 --> 36:24.007
in every one of these
botched timelines.

36:25.792 --> 36:27.228
- I'm sorry,

36:27.272 --> 36:29.839
but all I see is a threat
that needs to be taken out.

36:29.883 --> 36:33.060
Ray, fire when ready.

36:33.103 --> 36:35.105
- You got eggs.
- I got the eggs.

36:35.149 --> 36:36.933
I got the bread.
Got everything we need.

36:38.239 --> 36:41.242
- Soufflé, but first
things first, eh.

37:48.570 --> 37:50.703

it never leads

my mind is no longer
split in two,

my heart though.

38:21.951 --> 38:23.388
You?

Back to being mortal.

38:26.129 --> 38:29.785
- Sorry, guys.
It had to be done.

38:29.829 --> 38:32.527
- Well, let's go on and find
the Legends, shall we?

38:32.571 --> 38:34.573
- Yeah, see if all this
was worth it.

38:34.616 --> 38:35.791

pretty normal so far.

you dingalings.

38:50.502 --> 38:53.374
You better watch your knees,
Sara Lance.

38:53.418 --> 38:56.290
- Oh, no, is everyone
a puppet again?

38:57.813 --> 38:59.511
What are you talking about?
- I'll kill you all!

38:59.554 --> 39:02.383
- I got an anti-magic
isolation chamber

39:02.427 --> 39:04.385
with your name on it,
Mike the Spike.

39:04.429 --> 39:09.129

passes for normal around here.

39:11.044 --> 39:14.047
Why are you being so weird?

39:14.090 --> 39:15.875
- Well, I-

39:15.918 --> 39:18.051
I do have a little bit of
a tale to tell, to be honest.

39:18.094 --> 39:19.313
You fancy a drink?

39:19.357 --> 39:21.620
- Hmm, one of those stories.

39:21.663 --> 39:25.232
Let's go.

39:25.275 --> 39:29.584
- Hey, Zari, I wanted to say
that I'm sorry.

39:29.628 --> 39:31.281
For stuffing me into a bag

39:31.325 --> 39:32.892
or almost destroying
all of history?

39:32.935 --> 39:35.416
- Well, yeah, that too,
but what I'm really sorry about

39:35.460 --> 39:38.158
is that we got off
on the wrong foot.

39:38.201 --> 39:39.464
- You're a shapeshifter.

39:39.507 --> 39:40.900
Your whole deal
is tricking people.

39:40.943 --> 39:42.815
- Yeah, but now
I'm being honest with you.

39:42.858 --> 39:44.207
You know,
I could have been anyone

39:44.251 --> 39:45.731
when I got my powers back.

39:45.774 --> 39:47.907
Do you know why I kept coming
back to this form?

39:49.430 --> 39:50.866
- It's because this is
the form I was

39:50.910 --> 39:52.259
when I joined the Legends.

39:52.302 --> 39:54.653
Now, I have been a part
of many crews,

39:54.696 --> 39:55.871
and you guys--

39:55.915 --> 39:58.918
well, you're not rubbish.

39:58.961 --> 40:02.661
- Listen, destroying history
for personal gain,

40:02.704 --> 40:05.925
it's happened to almost
everyone here.

40:05.968 --> 40:09.015
Rite of passage.

40:17.415 --> 40:20.853
- I made snicker doodles
with your recipe.

40:20.896 --> 40:22.550
Not bad.

40:22.594 --> 40:23.899
- Hmm.

40:23.943 --> 40:26.554
I'm reading your novel.
I'm on the last chapter.

40:26.598 --> 40:29.514
Your females characters
are shallow, libidinous,

40:29.557 --> 40:32.125
and so much fun to read.

40:32.168 --> 40:33.474
- Hmm. Thanks.

40:33.518 --> 40:37.739
- Yeah, good job, um,
Rebecca Silver?

40:37.783 --> 40:39.175
- Nom de plume.

40:39.219 --> 40:40.568
- Got it.

40:40.612 --> 40:42.483
So let me get this straight.

40:42.527 --> 40:45.094
They're making love on
the surface of the sun?

40:45.138 --> 40:48.097
- It's a metaphor.

40:48.141 --> 40:49.403
- Got it.

40:53.494 --> 40:56.149
It didn't even make
a bloody difference.

40:56.192 --> 40:58.456
I was a fool thinking
I could outrun this fight

40:58.499 --> 41:00.588
flying around with you lot.

41:00.632 --> 41:04.549
- Yeah, we tend to fly
directly into fights.

41:04.592 --> 41:08.117
But we do it together,

41:08.161 --> 41:10.598
and we have your back.

yourself into

he doesn't just want to win.

41:17.736 --> 41:22.349

Um, there's been a setback,
but we'll make it right.
