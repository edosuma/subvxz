11:04.030 --> 11:05.657
He's _not available
rIght now.

11:05.690 --> 11:07.499
Mm, well, he will be
when you tell him

11:07.530 --> 11:09.225
I have
Raymond Reddington
in custody.

11:09.260 --> 11:10.966
COOPER:
Inspector Oban,

11:11.000 --> 11:13.662
this is the Assistant Director
Of the FBI, Harold Cooper.

11:13.700 --> 11:16.430
We have arrested Marvin Gerard
and have a tap on his lines

11:16.470 --> 11:18.859
in the hopes
that we might find
Raymond Reddington.

11:18.910 --> 11:20.036
Apparently, we have.

11:20.080 --> 11:22.435
Is any Of this true?
NO, but he doesn't
know that.

11:22.480 --> 11:23.947
If you have Reddington,
we need to meet.

11:23.980 --> 11:26.005
If you have him.
I'll need verification.

11:26.050 --> 11:27.517
Yes, understood.

11:27.550 --> 11:29.939
But since I_ am in Paris
and you are In WashIngton,

11:29.990 --> 11:32.083
uh, might I suggest
a meeting at our embassy

11:32.120 --> 11:33.678
between you
and our attache?

11:33.720 --> 11:34.948
Fine.
Make the arrangements.

11:34.990 --> 11:36.059
You're quite luclq,

11:36.090 --> 11:38.058
tapping the number
Reddington gave me tO call.

11:38.090 --> 11:39.421
Luck had nothing
tO do with it.

11:39.460 --> 11:42.623
Oh, no, I don't suppose
it did. Hm.

11:42.660 --> 11:44.799
(CELL PHONE BEEPS,
TELEPHONE BEEPS)
Think he suspects?

11:44.830 --> 11:46.627
Suspects what?
What...
What was all that?

11:46.670 --> 11:48.831
0100 is a dedicated line,

11:48.870 --> 11:51.100
a way for Reddington to let us
know if he's been arrested.

11:51.140 --> 11:52.778
He demands to speak
tO his lawyer,

11:52.810 --> 11:54.539
and we pretend like
we just arrested him.

11:54.580 --> 11:56.639
COOPER: This Inspector Oban,
I want a full rundown on him.

11:56.680 --> 11:58.307
Hang on, hang on.

11:58.350 --> 12:00.648
Mr. Reddington
goes 30 years
without getting caught,

12:00.680 --> 12:02.477
and now
he's been caught twice
within the last year.

12:04.920 --> 12:06.979
He wasn't
caught last year.

12:07.020 --> 12:09.511
Wasn't caught?
He was nearly executed.

12:10.390 --> 12:13.951
He was arrested,
but he wasn't caught.

12:14.000 --> 12:15.592
What's the difference?

12:16.430 --> 12:17.499
I turned him in.

12:17.530 --> 12:19.327
You what?
Why would you dO that?

12:19.370 --> 12:21.133
SO he couldn't get
in the way of me
trying to find out

12:21.170 --> 12:23.035
his real identity.
Whose real identity?

12:23.070 --> 12:24.059
Reddington's.

12:24.910 --> 12:26.878
Wait. Wh...
(LAUGHING) What?

12:26.910 --> 12:28.639
And you knew
about this?

12:28.680 --> 12:30.045
Yeah.

12:30.080 --> 12:32.378
And I promised Reddington
I'd keep it to myself.

12:33.120 --> 12:34.439
They deserve to know.

12:34.480 --> 12:35.515
Know what?

12:37.590 --> 12:40.184
That the real
Raymond Reddington
died in 1991

12:40.220 --> 12:44.429
and the man you
know as Reddington
was once a KGB agent

12:44.460 --> 12:46.223
named Ilya Koslov.

12:46.260 --> 12:48.728
That's impossible.
I knew Reddington.
I served with him.

12:48.760 --> 12:49.920
It's a long story.

12:51.070 --> 12:52.890
And I'll tell it to you
after we get him back.

12:52.940 --> 12:54.965
Reddington,
who you say is dead.

12:55.000 --> 12:56.695
It doesn't matter
who he was.

12:56.740 --> 12:58.503
I thought it did,
but it doesn't.

12:58.540 --> 13:00.371
And once you hear
the story,

13:00.410 --> 13:02.571
I don't think
it'll matter to you.

13:02.610 --> 13:05.272
The only thing
that matters
is that Reddington,

13:05.310 --> 13:08.848
our Reddington,
is in French custody,

13:08.880 --> 13:10.245
and we have tO
get him back.

and press him

13:18.930 --> 13:20.693
on who Reddington
may have been
meeting with.

13:20.730 --> 13:23.221
I'll reach out to Main Justice
and explaIn the SItuatlon.

13:23.730 --> 13:25.027
Which one?

13:25.070 --> 13:27.095
The one about
getting him back.

13:27.140 --> 13:29.096
Once we do that,
we can figure out the rest.

13:29.840 --> 13:30.909

we can't do that

Rene Oban.

14:03.170 --> 14:05.502
He was with the DGSI

14:05.540 --> 14:07.974
After that,
there's no record
of mm.

14:08.010 --> 14:10.899
Does the FBI have
a record Of you after
six years ago?

14:10.950 --> 14:12.542
If they do,
I couldn't find it.

14:13.650 --> 14:15.345
Fair enough.

14:15.380 --> 14:17.985
But before I say
anything, I need proof
that you have him.

14:22.120 --> 14:23.587
He was picked up
near the Seine,

14:23.630 --> 14:25.951

An agent who doesn't exist.

14:38.440 --> 14:40.499
And yet, when we call
Reddington's lawyer,

14:40.540 --> 14:42.838
you pick up
and demand his return.

14:42.880 --> 14:44.279
I wonder...

14:44.310 --> 14:45.709
Is that because
he's your fugitive

14:45.750 --> 14:47.843
or because you
work for him?

he can wait for the
