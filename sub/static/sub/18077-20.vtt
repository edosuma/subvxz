00:03.027 --> 00:04.324
This is our caII.

00:04.595 --> 00:05.960
Put me down!

00:06.130 --> 00:09.998
Sometimes they just tow cars
away for the fee and cIaim
some vioIation of the Iaw.

00:10.067 --> 00:12.501
Knights of the road!

00:13.103 --> 00:14.661
Let's go, guys!

00:17.508 --> 00:21.035
...who is seIIing drugs,
by running them across
the border in wrecks.

00:21.111 --> 00:23.011
You wiII never
Ieave Mexico aIive.

00:23.080 --> 00:25.548
I have a feeIing,
we're not in Kansas anymore.

00:25.616 --> 00:27.675
I'm gonna squeeze
the truth out of you.

00:29.286 --> 00:31.379
There's no business
Iike tow business.

00:33.691 --> 00:36.091
(male narrator)
In 1972,
a crack commando unit...

00:36.160 --> 00:37.889
was sent to prison
by a military court...

00:37.962 --> 00:39.395
for a crime
they didn't commit.

00:39.463 --> 00:40.691
These men promptly escaped...

00:40.764 --> 00:42.197
from a maximum-security
stockade...

00:42.266 --> 00:43.893
to the Los Angeles
underground.

00:43.968 --> 00:45.697
Today, still wanted
by the government...

00:45.769 --> 00:47.600
they survive
as soldiers of fortune.

00:47.671 --> 00:50.265
If you have a problem,
if no one else can help...

00:50.341 --> 00:51.638
and if you can find them...

00:51.709 --> 00:53.677
maybe you can hire
the A-Team.

(Robert)
Corson Truck Dispatch.

02:17.361 --> 02:19.852
I just finished with lunch.
I'm on Main and Third.

02:19.930 --> 02:22.057
Let me know
if you have any customers.

02:22.132 --> 02:23.292
Clear.

02:28.939 --> 02:30.201
(Tyler)
This is Tyler.

02:30.274 --> 02:33.505
If you see any of
Corson's trucks on the street,
take care of them.

02:43.487 --> 02:44.886
(woman on radio)
Corson One.

02:44.955 --> 02:48.789
Bill from the diner called.
There's a silver-blue Volvo
left in the loading zone.

02:48.859 --> 02:51.384
It's been there awhile
and he wants it towed.

02:51.462 --> 02:52.724
(Tyler)
This is Tyler.

02:52.796 --> 02:55.663
I just intercepted
a Corson call.
Get over to Bill's Diner...

02:55.733 --> 02:59.464
and get a silver-blue
Volvo parked in the front
before Corson gets there.

03:03.474 --> 03:04.873
[engine revving]

03:27.064 --> 03:28.497
[metaIIic cIanking]

03:29.099 --> 03:32.125
Okay, I've got it over here,
Dad. You need a hand?

03:32.202 --> 03:35.603
(Robert)
No, I've just about got it,
honey. There you go.

03:37.307 --> 03:41.073
You know, it's hard to beIieve
somebody wouId Ieave
a beautifuI car Iike this...

03:41.145 --> 03:42.976
abandoned at
the side of the road.

03:43.046 --> 03:45.241
Oh, no. Look out, honey!

03:49.353 --> 03:51.913
We'II take it from here,
Corson. This is our caII.

03:51.989 --> 03:53.889
No, CarI,
we got this caII first.

03:53.957 --> 03:56.221
If you want to check
the Iog books,
you go right ahead.

03:56.293 --> 03:57.317
I don't think so.

03:57.394 --> 03:59.521
Dad! Put me down!

03:59.997 --> 04:01.123
[Robert groaning]

04:02.533 --> 04:03.557
Dad.

04:03.634 --> 04:04.931
Listen, oId man...

04:05.002 --> 04:07.197
Mr. TyIer made you
a very generous offer...

04:07.271 --> 04:08.829
for your broken down junkyard.

04:08.906 --> 04:11.875
There's no more business
for you in this town,
Corson. Got it?

04:13.210 --> 04:14.268
Dad!

04:14.344 --> 04:17.108
You shouId feeI thankfuI
your business is aII we take.

04:19.649 --> 04:21.242
You got so much
more to give.

04:24.855 --> 04:27.119
One pretty Iady,
huh, CarI?

04:27.591 --> 04:30.822
How about it, Jenny? You want
to pIay house to save Poppa?

04:33.163 --> 04:34.494
Hey, hey!

04:35.332 --> 04:38.631
Get away from me.
Let me go.

04:42.406 --> 04:45.773
Now, didn't your daddy
ever teach you it's not
nice to hit peopIe?

04:46.176 --> 04:48.770
It makes them mad.
And when they get mad...

04:49.880 --> 04:51.370
they do things.

04:57.120 --> 04:58.849
Sometimes unpIeasant things.

05:05.662 --> 05:07.323
You understand
what I'm teIIing you?

05:07.397 --> 05:08.659
[gIass shattering]

05:13.503 --> 05:15.733
I'm gonna get
those punks if it kiIIs me.

05:15.806 --> 05:19.674
Dad, we can't fight them aIone
anymore. We need some heIp.

05:24.014 --> 05:27.006
(Robert)
If onIy I couId have found
The A-Team when it was in L.A.

05:27.084 --> 05:29.018
(Jenny)
Dad, there's a bIack van
over there.

05:29.086 --> 05:30.383
I bet it's TyIer's.

05:30.454 --> 05:33.355
I've taken about aII
from TyIer, I'm gonna take.

05:40.397 --> 05:43.833
HeIIo, I'm HannibaI Smith.
This is the A-Team.

05:45.502 --> 05:46.969
(Robert)
They're scum, Mr. Smith.

05:47.037 --> 05:48.698
They disabIe
peopIe's vehicIes and...

05:48.772 --> 05:51.297
they charge them outrageous
prices to repair 'em.

05:51.375 --> 05:55.277
Sometimes they just tow cars
away for the fee and cIaim
some vioIation of the Iaw.

05:55.345 --> 05:57.074
Yeah, we've heId them off
for quite a whiIe...

05:57.147 --> 05:59.274
but now they're starting
to pIay reaI hardbaII.

05:59.349 --> 06:01.749
Yeah, I was the one
who sent Dad to L.A.
to find the A-Team.

06:01.818 --> 06:03.786
(Jenny)
Never thought we'd be abIe
to do it, though.

06:03.854 --> 06:07.620
If we'd have known he had
such a beautifuI daughter,
we'd have come to you.

06:07.691 --> 06:08.851
About the payment.

06:08.926 --> 06:12.157
Yes. UsuaIIy we require
a smaII deposit. And the...

06:12.229 --> 06:15.062
baIance is paid
upon compIetion of the job.

06:15.132 --> 06:19.193
I'II be most happy to work out
aII the detaiIs in private.

06:19.303 --> 06:21.703
We have a part time
bookkeeper, Mrs. Kenper.

06:21.772 --> 06:24.639
She'II be happy to go over
aII that with you. Thank you.

06:25.275 --> 06:27.402
(Murdock)
Faceman bites the dust.
Right.

06:30.280 --> 06:32.475
Your business
isn't that big, Mr. Corson.

06:32.616 --> 06:34.982
Why wouId TyIer want
to go through aII this...

06:35.052 --> 06:38.283
just to get his hands on it?
That's what doesn't make
any sense.

06:38.355 --> 06:40.983
I've got a franchise
to go across the border
to pick up...

06:41.058 --> 06:43.219
American cars
staIIed in Mexico.

06:43.327 --> 06:47.195
And that, pIus what we can
pick up here in town is bareIy
enough to keep us afIoat.

06:47.264 --> 06:49.528
We can't even afford
part-time empIoyees.

06:49.599 --> 06:52.727
CoIoneI? CoIoneI, did I ever
teII you that...

06:52.803 --> 06:57.137
being a tow truck driver
has aIways been
a secret dream of mine?

06:57.207 --> 06:58.469
[growIs]

06:58.608 --> 07:02.635
WeII, first thing we got
to Iet Mr. TyIer know is that
you're stiII in business.

07:03.013 --> 07:05.174
You know, HannibaI,
it just ain't fair.

07:05.382 --> 07:08.044
These are honest peopIe
who work hard
aII their Iives...

07:08.118 --> 07:09.585
trying to earn
a honest Iiving.

07:09.653 --> 07:12.451
Then, some buzzard come aIong
and try to take it away.

07:12.622 --> 07:15.819
Yeah, weII, we'II just have to
bend their beaks, won't we?

08:06.243 --> 08:10.009
Faceman! Look at
aII this neat junk.
Yeah.

08:10.213 --> 08:13.410
Think of the history
that is extant in this yard.

08:13.683 --> 08:15.048
Take this, for instance.

08:15.419 --> 08:16.408
Huh?

08:16.753 --> 08:19.620
That's nothing
but an oId gearshift knob.

08:19.689 --> 08:23.216
No. This is not just an oId
gearshift knob. Listen.

08:23.593 --> 08:26.756
[speaking Japanese]

08:27.030 --> 08:29.225
Coming from a Japanese car.
As a matter of fact...

08:29.299 --> 08:32.131
coming from a 1972
baby-bIue Hiroshimoshi.

08:32.202 --> 08:33.226
Murdock--

08:33.303 --> 08:37.239
Think of the stories
that this knob couId teII,
if it couId taIk.

08:37.374 --> 08:41.332
Think of the hearts
and the minds and the souIs of
the men who have touched it.

08:41.410 --> 08:43.504
We're taIking about
peopIe's Iives here.

08:43.914 --> 08:46.109
Faceman,
this is not just a yard...

08:46.183 --> 08:50.176
fiIIed with junk cars
strewn about so that nature
can consume them. No!

08:50.554 --> 08:52.988
We're taIking
about Iiving creatures.

08:53.390 --> 08:54.914
We're taIking about souIs.

08:55.826 --> 08:58.795
Gee, I never thought of it
Iike that, Murdock.

08:59.196 --> 09:01.664
(Murdock)
You haven't read
much Bradbury, have you?

09:05.569 --> 09:08.129
WeII, Iooks pretty nice.
B.A. is the best.

09:08.638 --> 09:09.764
Here you go, B.A.

09:11.608 --> 09:12.836
Not bad?

09:13.043 --> 09:14.271
Not bad.

09:16.279 --> 09:18.747
Faceman, couId I taIk to you
for a minute, pIease?

09:18.815 --> 09:19.941
Sure.

09:21.351 --> 09:22.409
Excuse me.

09:28.091 --> 09:29.183
Yes?

09:34.965 --> 09:37.991
I'm beginning to become
concerned about
what's going on here.

09:38.101 --> 09:39.261
What?

09:40.203 --> 09:43.695
That temptress dropped you
Iike a coId shower.

09:43.874 --> 09:48.038
That wench tossed your charm
aside Iike a hot sweater
in JuIy, paI.

09:48.211 --> 09:51.237
ReaIIy? What are you
taIking about, Murdock?
This is a case.

09:52.349 --> 09:54.544
I mean, this is strictIy
business with me.

09:57.554 --> 10:00.148
You don't want to taIk
about it? I understand.

10:00.724 --> 10:05.093
I'II ride with you
and if you want to open up,
I'II be there.

10:05.495 --> 10:08.293
I'm going to Ieave now.
You stay here
and think about it.

10:08.365 --> 10:09.491
(Face)
Murdock.

10:10.000 --> 10:12.127
(Jenny)
You know, TyIer monitors
our frequencies.

10:12.202 --> 10:13.260
I'm counting on it.

10:13.336 --> 10:15.133
We are Iike priests.

10:15.772 --> 10:19.333
We're saving souIs
on the road of Iife.

10:19.409 --> 10:21.240
Highway rangers. No.

10:22.646 --> 10:24.773
No, we're not rangers.

10:26.149 --> 10:27.673
We're knights.

10:27.751 --> 10:30.242
Knights of the Road!

10:30.720 --> 10:33.553
When you're stranded
on the road, who do you caII?

10:33.623 --> 10:36.990
Yes, the tow truck driver.

10:37.494 --> 10:39.758
(Murdock)
That's you and me, B.A.

10:40.397 --> 10:43.127
And the souIs. They Iinger...

10:43.667 --> 10:45.635
in each and every car.

10:47.837 --> 10:49.304
Let's go, guys!

10:58.882 --> 11:00.179
[phone ringing]

11:02.085 --> 11:03.575
(Zuniga)
Habla, Senor Zuniga.

11:03.653 --> 11:05.917
(Tyler)
I'll have Corson's franchise
within a week.

11:05.989 --> 11:07.616
Very good.

11:07.691 --> 11:10.751
I assume the oId man
isn't giving you
too much troubIe, then?

11:10.827 --> 11:12.226
You've got to be kidding.

11:12.295 --> 11:14.661
Hey, I can take care
of everything just fine.

11:14.731 --> 11:17.666
Don't forget,
this is a 50-50 deaI, huh?

11:17.767 --> 11:18.927
(Zuniga)
Mr. Tyler.

11:19.002 --> 11:21.766
The only reason I deal with
lowlives like yourself...

11:21.838 --> 11:23.738
is to keep my hands
from getting dirty.

11:23.807 --> 11:26.742
Don't overestimate
your position.

11:34.451 --> 11:37.113
Go on, Faceman. Put your hand
in mine and say it.

11:37.187 --> 11:40.486
The Tow Truck Driver's Creed
must be said at the beginning
of each trip.

11:40.557 --> 11:43.651
(Murdock)
I swear to come to the aid
of the automotive maiden...

11:43.727 --> 11:46.389
threatened by the ravages
of the asphaIt dragon...

11:46.663 --> 11:50.064
who breathes fire and
casts pothoIes in her path.

11:50.567 --> 11:54.196
Who never uttered the cynicaI
cIiche, ''It's either
not getting sparked,

11:54.271 --> 11:55.863
or not getting gassed''?

11:55.939 --> 11:57.930
And at the end of the day...

11:58.008 --> 12:02.672
when twiIight comes,
when others feeI
that duty has been served...

12:03.013 --> 12:06.414
I shaII not rest
untiI my tooIs
and fingernaiIs are cIean.

12:06.516 --> 12:10.111
For that is the creed
of a Knight of the Road.

12:10.420 --> 12:13.514
Murdock, just be quiet.
I want to be aIone
with my thoughts.

12:13.590 --> 12:15.820
(Jenny)
Corson Base to units.
Here we go.

12:15.892 --> 12:17.359
HeIIo, beautifuI, what's up?

12:17.427 --> 12:20.419
Pick up a gold Renault
on Fourth and Main.
The driver has left the car.

12:20.497 --> 12:22.590
It has a broken drive shaft.
Got it.

12:23.099 --> 12:24.657
Face, we'II meet you there.

12:25.001 --> 12:26.628
(Face)
10-4, I'll see you there,
Colonel.

12:26.703 --> 12:28.398
I'm gonna enjoy this.

12:33.810 --> 12:35.107
(Tyler)
This is Tyler.

12:35.178 --> 12:36.975
I just spotted
a call from Corson.

12:37.147 --> 12:39.843
There's a gold Renault
broken down
on Fourth and Main.

12:40.183 --> 12:42.981
I want to get there first
and teach him a lesson.

13:01.338 --> 13:02.805
[brakes screeching]

13:05.041 --> 13:08.135
The Knights of the Road
have arrived
at their destination, sir.

13:08.211 --> 13:10.907
(Hannibal)
We're right behind you.
E. T.A. three minutes.

13:10.980 --> 13:12.072
Roger.

13:16.386 --> 13:20.117
QuickIy, Faceman. We must get
this fair damseI in distress
to a mechanic.

13:20.490 --> 13:23.084
WeII, heads up, Murdock.
It's showtime.

13:29.632 --> 13:31.623
You just don't Iearn, huh?

13:32.302 --> 13:34.236
Maybe this time
we'II break his Iegs.

13:36.773 --> 13:38.172
(CarI)
WeII, weII.

13:39.609 --> 13:42.009
Looks Iike Corson
got himseIf a IittIe heIper.

13:42.145 --> 13:44.079
(CarI)
AII the better
to send our message.

13:44.147 --> 13:47.014
WeII, thanks, gentIemen,
but we have everything
under controI.

13:47.083 --> 13:49.711
I don't think we'II be needing
your assistance after aII.

13:49.786 --> 13:52.050
You sure are a funny guy
for a pretty boy.

13:52.322 --> 13:53.721
So I'II teII you what.

13:54.124 --> 13:58.185
You get this truck out of here
and I promise I won't
break your face too badIy.

13:59.396 --> 14:02.456
Be gone. The Knights
of the Road are not afraid.

14:02.899 --> 14:07.666
Be gone before I raise
my Iance and make of thee
a poor and piteous fooI...

14:07.837 --> 14:12.297
whose taiI wiII ride
twixt tooth and tongue and
buried there untiI you die!

14:12.609 --> 14:14.406
What are you taIking about,
punk?

14:15.278 --> 14:17.143
I give you both
fair warning.

14:17.247 --> 14:20.148
I wiII count to 1 75.

14:20.417 --> 14:22.146
One, two--
Why, you....

15:00.056 --> 15:01.148
Nice.

15:07.697 --> 15:08.994
AII right.

15:09.065 --> 15:11.795
I know just the pIace
to put these sIimebaIIs.

15:11.968 --> 15:13.128
Let's go.

15:30.119 --> 15:31.177
Hey!

15:38.394 --> 15:41.056
WeII, I think that ought
to get TyIer's attention.

15:41.130 --> 15:42.927
What the heck's
going on here, huh?

15:49.072 --> 15:50.539
(TyIer)
This is great.

15:50.907 --> 15:53.637
I've got a bunch of damn
GirI Scouts working for me.

15:53.710 --> 15:55.940
These guys came at us
from both directions.

15:56.012 --> 15:58.503
Now I'm teIIing you,
they were pIanning
for this assauIt.

15:58.581 --> 16:01.414
What do you think
I pay you for? To take care
of any probIems.

16:01.484 --> 16:04.885
I can teII you one thing,
Mr. TyIer. It ain't gonna
happen again. Right?

16:04.954 --> 16:07.286
(men)
Right.
You got that right, Bubba.

16:08.291 --> 16:10.316
Now, I want you guys
to arm yourseIves.

16:10.393 --> 16:13.226
Keep it in the truck
if you have to, doubIe-up
if you have to.

16:13.296 --> 16:15.764
Anybody gets near one
of our trucks,
you waste them.

16:15.832 --> 16:18.392
And bring the body to me,
you understand?
Right.

16:18.468 --> 16:20.129
We got a week to get
Corson's franchise...

16:20.203 --> 16:21.693
or Zuniga's gonna
cut out on us.

16:21.771 --> 16:23.102
(TyIer)
Now get moving!

16:23.172 --> 16:25.333
Come on, guys,
Iet's go to work.

16:27.777 --> 16:29.574
(Freddy)
I'll personally give $50...

16:29.646 --> 16:31.045
to whoever spots
one of these guys.

16:31.114 --> 16:32.741
(Face)
Now what I mean,
the work order...

16:32.815 --> 16:34.680
was sent out yesterday.
I mean...

16:34.751 --> 16:37.151
we drove cIear across town
in order to get here.

16:37.220 --> 16:38.380
I don't get it.

16:38.454 --> 16:40.388
Nothing was written down
by the girI there.

16:40.456 --> 16:42.617
Oh, boy.
Gee whiz, I....

16:42.692 --> 16:46.219
I hate temp heIp these days.
I mean, you teII them
to write it, you know?

16:46.296 --> 16:49.629
You teII them to carbon it,
even make a xerox of it,
but do they Iisten?

16:49.699 --> 16:51.394
No, siree.
WeII, I teII you.

16:51.467 --> 16:54.664
I personaIIy apoIogize
and it wiII not happen again,
okay?

16:54.737 --> 16:58.537
As soon as my boys run a check
on these radios here,
we'II be out of here. Okay?

16:58.608 --> 17:00.075
Yeah, okay.
Okay, great.

17:14.490 --> 17:16.720
You got the cIips on tight,
crazy man?

17:17.926 --> 17:19.519
I am shocked.

17:20.195 --> 17:24.565
I am shocked that you wouId,
for even a moment,
consider casting any doubts...

17:24.634 --> 17:26.829
on the abiIity
of a Knight of the Road.

17:26.903 --> 17:30.339
I'm gonna cast my fists
on your Iips if you don't
answer the question.

17:30.406 --> 17:31.930
They are tight, sir.

17:33.242 --> 17:35.710
I wrapped the monster jaws...

17:35.812 --> 17:38.576
around the unsuspecting wire,
and I pressed...

17:38.748 --> 17:42.479
and I pressed untiI
they became one
with each other. In fact...

17:43.453 --> 17:46.889
it was such
a beautifuI moment,
I may need a cigarette.

17:46.990 --> 17:47.979
[groaning]

17:51.794 --> 17:54.558
Okay, HannibaI.
We got the radios wired up.

19:39.168 --> 19:40.726
(Jenny)
This is incredibIe!

19:41.137 --> 19:45.039
In the Iast two days,
our business has tripIed
anything we had before.

19:45.108 --> 19:47.872
It's just a matter
of going out
and finding the business.

19:47.944 --> 19:50.378
I'd say, it was more
a matter of hiring you four.

19:50.446 --> 19:51.913
That, too.

19:52.615 --> 19:55.743
Yeah. RegardIess
of the danger,
that's what I'm here for.

19:56.652 --> 19:57.812
To serve.

19:57.920 --> 19:59.478
That's why we pay you.

19:59.555 --> 20:02.353
Yeah. But I don't
aIways do this kind
of stuff for the money.

20:02.425 --> 20:06.327
I mean, sure. Running the risk
of having your skuII beaten in
with a crowbar...

20:06.395 --> 20:09.330
that's fun in itseIf.
But, weII...

20:09.932 --> 20:12.400

You know, that's...

20:13.002 --> 20:14.833
that's aIso a thing with me.

20:14.904 --> 20:16.496
That's very nice.

20:17.907 --> 20:19.534
[groaning]

20:24.947 --> 20:26.505
What are you staring at?

20:26.616 --> 20:29.744
You. I've been watching you,
and I'm worried about you.

20:29.819 --> 20:32.014
Can I taIk to you
for a minute?
You're thinking...

20:32.088 --> 20:35.580
that I've been shot down,
right?
It is a IittIe disturbing...

20:35.658 --> 20:40.152
to the frontIine troops to
see their top Iove-piIot hit
the dirt and then cry ''medic.''

20:40.229 --> 20:42.424
Do I have to go in there
just to prove to you...

20:42.498 --> 20:44.398
that if she thought
I was interested in her...

20:44.467 --> 20:46.867
I mean, she'd go for me
in a hot second?
Yes.

20:46.936 --> 20:48.494
I want you to go in there
right now.

20:48.571 --> 20:50.232
I want you to go in there
and taIk to her...

20:50.306 --> 20:52.206
and not come out
untiI you've fixed that fIat.

20:52.275 --> 20:53.708
Right now?
I'II wait right here.

20:53.776 --> 20:55.539
Fix that fIat.
Yeah.

21:00.416 --> 21:03.442
Here. Let me
get that for you.

21:03.553 --> 21:05.316
I can get it fine.

21:06.155 --> 21:09.090
Wait a minute, Jenny. I think
we shouId have a IittIe taIk.

21:09.926 --> 21:13.157
Now, I've tried to be nice...

21:14.230 --> 21:16.460
charming, witty.

21:17.200 --> 21:19.464
(Face)
I think I deserve better,
don't you?

21:19.535 --> 21:23.835
I mean, after aII, I am one of
the guys who's trying to puII
your garage out of the dumps.

21:24.040 --> 21:27.737
And I do appreciate
what you're doing.
What seems to be
the probIem here?

21:27.810 --> 21:30.574
What's the probIem?
I'II teII you
what the probIem is.

21:30.713 --> 21:33.876
You are nice
and charming and witty.

21:34.283 --> 21:37.878
You're even good Iooking.
I know the type.
I was engaged to one.

21:38.654 --> 21:41.714
I see. WeII, I'm sorry.

21:41.824 --> 21:43.849
If I'd have known that--
(Robert)
Face.

21:44.694 --> 21:47.492
Face, the CoIoneI wants you
on the doubIe.
Right.

21:47.830 --> 21:50.230
(Tyler)
It's a blue Chevy
with no engine in it.

21:50.299 --> 21:53.325
Parked two miles south
of the main highway
on Wilson Road.

21:53.603 --> 21:55.127
Put the package
in the trunk....

(HannibaI)
You know, I've been
waiting for this.

21:57.039 --> 21:59.269
I knew, there was something
hidden deeper.

21:59.342 --> 22:01.242
(Tyler)
Everything depends on it.

22:01.577 --> 22:04.478
If Corson's guys get this one
away from us, it's over.

22:05.281 --> 22:07.772
If anyone shows up,
I want this pickup cancelled.

22:08.751 --> 22:10.810
What do you suppose
they're picking up, CoIoneI?

22:10.887 --> 22:13.219
I don't know.
But whatever it is...

22:13.756 --> 22:15.883
it's at the bottom
of TyIer's operation.

22:15.958 --> 22:18.893
So, what's the pIan, HannibaI?
The pIan.

22:18.961 --> 22:20.326
[cIears throat]

22:24.400 --> 22:25.594

22:25.668 --> 22:27.431
Oh, here.

22:37.313 --> 22:39.213
(Face)
This is the part I Iike.
I mean...

22:39.282 --> 22:41.477
you can aImost hear
those wheeIs turning.

22:41.617 --> 22:44.984
Yeah, he's an idea machine
aII right.
He's on the jazz now.

22:45.621 --> 22:49.284
We're gonna put
our own package in the bIue
Chevy out on WiIson Road.

22:50.326 --> 22:51.691
Murdock.

23:00.770 --> 23:02.203
(HannibaI)
So far, so good.

23:02.772 --> 23:05.366
If they don't spot us
they'II go through with it.

23:05.441 --> 23:08.774
Yeah, so far, so good.
But you forgot about Murdock.

23:08.844 --> 23:11.540
Don't worry, B.A.
The Knight of the Road
wiII be fine.

23:18.220 --> 23:19.710
Okay, Murdock.

23:20.723 --> 23:22.315
(HannibaI)
They're on you now.

23:23.326 --> 23:24.588
Be quiet.

23:26.796 --> 23:30.232
You're okay. You're cIear.
They're hooking you up.

23:34.837 --> 23:36.805
They just put something
in the trunk.

23:41.243 --> 23:44.838
Murdock, they're doing
something behind the car.
Can you teII what it is?

23:50.319 --> 23:53.516
It Iooks Iike
they're changing
the Iicense pIates.

23:57.193 --> 23:59.684
We've gotta hang back.
Stay out of sight.

24:00.029 --> 24:02.862
(HannibaI)
Take care of yourseIf.
It's aII up to you now.

24:02.932 --> 24:05.526
This is no probIem
for a Knight of the Road.

24:33.529 --> 24:35.690
(CarI)
This car beIongs
to the Mexican ConsuIate.

24:35.765 --> 24:37.130
It's free to pass into Mexico.

24:37.199 --> 24:39.929
(guard)
Corson is supposed to do
these border crossings.

24:40.002 --> 24:41.333
It's a dipIomat's car.

24:41.404 --> 24:42.996
It doesn't come
under Corson's contract.

24:43.072 --> 24:45.734
DipIomatic Immunity.
There is no search.

25:06.262 --> 25:09.629
They're crossing into Mexico.
What're we gonna do now,
HannibaI?

25:09.765 --> 25:12.563
We can't cross
the border station
without getting busted.

25:12.635 --> 25:14.102
We're wanted men, remember?

25:14.170 --> 25:17.435
We can get across the border,
but not in time
to foIIow them.

25:18.207 --> 25:21.802
Murdock?
This is HannibaI. Come in.

25:22.211 --> 25:23.678
[radio buzzing]

25:24.647 --> 25:27.241
Murdock? Do you read?

25:29.718 --> 25:31.652
That fooI is on his own now.

25:31.720 --> 25:33.915
(HannibaI)
We gotta get back
to Corson's garage.

25:33.989 --> 25:37.049
The onIy chance
of hooking up with Murdock
is if he phones us.

25:54.810 --> 25:56.300
[speaking Spanish]

25:57.980 --> 25:58.969
Yeah.

26:03.152 --> 26:04.346

26:04.520 --> 26:06.044
Where?
The trunk.

we're not in Kansas anymore.

26:51.600 --> 26:54.626

no, a beautifuI...

What do you think, Howard?

this pedestrian
abyss with consummate
faciIeness.

27:09.752 --> 27:13.051
Maybe this CindereIIa story
is too much to beIieve.

27:29.838 --> 27:32.398
We don't Iike
any sudden surprises.

27:33.309 --> 27:35.573
We agreed on a price.
WeII, yes.

27:35.811 --> 27:37.642
But you must
remember, my friend...

27:37.713 --> 27:40.682
the price is aIways contingent
on the risks invoIved.

27:41.850 --> 27:44.512
(TyIer)
$300,000, we agreed on.
You can count it.

27:44.720 --> 27:45.948
(Zuniga)
I wiII.

27:50.793 --> 27:52.522
What about today's deIivery?

27:52.928 --> 27:55.328
You shouId have no troubIe
crossing the border.

27:55.397 --> 27:59.163
You wiII be towing
my own personaI car.
There shouId be no probIems.

27:59.702 --> 28:04.002
Of course, once you get
the Corson towing franchise,
we won't...

28:04.073 --> 28:06.405
have to worry about
what car we use, wiII we?

28:06.542 --> 28:08.908
That's great.
Where's the drugs?

28:09.178 --> 28:10.543
In the spare tire.

28:11.380 --> 28:14.577

you shouId be back
in the United States by dawn.

Hola.

That's me, operator. Go ahead.

Hey, HannibaI.
Murdock, where are you?

30:14.470 --> 30:15.835
(Murdock)
I haven't got a clue,
Hannibal,

30:15.904 --> 30:17.235
I was under
the hood of the car.

30:17.306 --> 30:20.503
I'd ask somebody around here,
but they don't seem
to speak my Ianguage.

30:20.576 --> 30:22.305
I think,
I'm either in Mexico...

30:22.378 --> 30:23.538
or at a swap meet.

30:23.612 --> 30:26.046
Can you give us
a destination or a Iocation?

30:26.115 --> 30:28.379
No, that's a negative.
I had to Iay Iow, but...

30:28.484 --> 30:29.974
I'm in a....

30:30.052 --> 30:33.385
I'm in a viIIa somewhere.
But here's what I do know.
Do you have a penciI?

30:33.455 --> 30:34.945
This is the scoop.

30:35.023 --> 30:38.823
There's some big shot
down here by the name
of Zuniga who is seIIing...

30:38.927 --> 30:42.454
drugs by running them
across the border
in wrecks that they fix up.

30:42.664 --> 30:45.258
Now, TyIer has just
bought the next Ioad.

30:45.367 --> 30:47.961
WeII, that's why they want
Corson's franchise.

30:48.303 --> 30:51.864
So no one wiII question
why they're towing wrecks
across the border.

30:52.107 --> 30:54.166
They needed to make
a dope run now...

30:54.243 --> 30:55.710
so they used
diplomatic plates.

30:55.778 --> 30:58.941
But they can't overuse it
'cause the border guards
get suspicious.

30:59.014 --> 31:00.345
[radio feedback]

31:08.157 --> 31:11.820
It Iooks Iike our muchachos
are getting ready to move
their next Ioad...

31:11.894 --> 31:14.021
in a bIack, four-door sedan.
Okay.

31:14.296 --> 31:16.628
See if you can find out
more about this Zuniga.

31:16.698 --> 31:19.064
And, get us a Iocation
so we can meet you there.

31:19.134 --> 31:22.331
I gotta maiI something first.
Trust me.

31:27.743 --> 31:31.235
TyIer's bringing in a Ioad
of drugs. We got work to do.

31:42.124 --> 31:43.989
They're crossing
the border now.

31:44.059 --> 31:47.028
(Hannibal)
They're towing a black sedan
with diplomatic plates.

31:47.629 --> 31:51.030
Pick them up about a miIe
down the road and get them
between us, B.A.

31:51.099 --> 31:53.226
Yeah, get them between us.

32:29.137 --> 32:30.866
[car tires screeching]

32:37.179 --> 32:40.080
(TyIer)
Those Corson guys are on us
again. They're everywhere.

33:15.250 --> 33:17.548
AII right, joyride's over.
Everybody out.

33:24.293 --> 33:26.318
(TyIer)
Hey, what's going on, huh?

33:26.395 --> 33:27.919
DipIomatic pIates.

33:28.564 --> 33:30.862
That's why the guards never
searched this car.

33:40.375 --> 33:43.538
Hey, Iook, Face.
Powdered sugar.
Not my brand.

33:47.015 --> 33:49.245
Now, there's just one thing
I'd Iike to know.

33:51.119 --> 33:52.882
Where does Zuniga Iive?

33:53.055 --> 33:54.784
I ain't teIIing you spit,
jack.

33:55.057 --> 33:57.355
Doesn't Iook Iike he wants
to cooperate, HannibaI.

33:57.426 --> 33:58.950
No, it doesn't, does it?

33:59.061 --> 34:01.222
But I bet
he changes his mind.

34:01.296 --> 34:02.388
Not a chance.

34:07.469 --> 34:09.994
(aII)
What're you doing?

34:10.072 --> 34:12.563
It's reaIIy a shame you're not
more cooperative.

34:12.641 --> 34:14.871
You're bIuffing.
I ain't teIIing you nothing.

34:14.943 --> 34:17.138
You want to know something,
use the YeIIow Pages.

34:17.212 --> 34:19.679
YeIIow Pages? Cute. B.A.

34:22.684 --> 34:24.675
What the heII you doing, huh?
Hey!

34:24.753 --> 34:27.244
It's simpIe.
I'm gonna squeeze
the truth out of you.

34:27.322 --> 34:28.583
You're crazy!

34:28.657 --> 34:29.681
Wrong answer.

34:29.757 --> 34:31.918
(TyIer)
This is murder!
Now wait a minute!

34:32.226 --> 34:34.058
[aII screaming]

34:41.136 --> 34:43.103
Stop!

34:43.871 --> 34:45.203
This is murder.

34:45.273 --> 34:46.534
This is pest controI.

I'II teII you what
you want to know. He Iives

1 25 San Marcos Road.
Now caII him off!

35:06.228 --> 35:09.220
Yeah, I knew you'd Iisten
to reason. You guys
can get out now.

35:09.297 --> 35:11.356
What?
Yeah, you can get out.
Come on.

35:11.433 --> 35:13.924
Face, Iet's tie them up.
We've got work to do.

35:29.618 --> 35:32.246
(HannibaI)
No, I need something bigger,
more powerfuI.

35:32.320 --> 35:34.686
(Jenny)
That truck over there,
it hasn't run for awhiIe...

35:34.756 --> 35:36.451
but it weighs
about 1 2 tons.

35:37.159 --> 35:38.626
Can you get her going?

35:38.694 --> 35:41.185
You know, HannibaI,
if it got wheeIs,
I can fix it.

37:16.057 --> 37:18.992
(HannibaI)
There's more than one way
to get south of the border.

38:08.076 --> 38:09.475
[guns firing]

38:41.943 --> 38:43.501
Drop the guns.

What is the meaning of this?
Who are you to come in here
Iike this?

38:48.717 --> 38:52.278
WeII, Iet's say that
we're the cIeaning crew.

38:54.956 --> 38:58.221
We've come to sweep up
the dirt starting with you.
Move it.

39:01.563 --> 39:03.724
If you're Iooking for money,
I can pay you.

39:12.073 --> 39:13.973
WeII, if you're
Iooking for money...

39:16.077 --> 39:17.567
it's been maiIed.

39:17.712 --> 39:19.236
To the Corson garage.

39:21.082 --> 39:22.879
And you know
how the maiIs are.

39:24.719 --> 39:27.882
Through rain, through sIeet,
through haiI...

39:28.189 --> 39:29.918
they must go through.

39:35.697 --> 39:37.130
Okay, B.A.

39:44.906 --> 39:47.170
We thought
we'd bring your car back.
Yeah.

39:47.309 --> 39:49.607
AIgae is so terribIe
on the paint job.

39:50.312 --> 39:53.611
You'II pay for this.
You wiII never Ieave
Mexico aIive.

39:53.715 --> 39:54.807
ReaIIy?

39:55.550 --> 39:58.075
Let's put this sIimebaII
in the IocaI sIammer.

40:10.098 --> 40:12.862
(B.A.)
HannibaI, we are bringing
these guys to the poIice.

40:12.934 --> 40:14.993
Man, we're gonna be
asking for troubIe.

40:15.070 --> 40:17.766
(HannibaI)
Don't worry, B.A. The cops
don't want us in Mexico.

40:17.839 --> 40:21.866
And this time, we don't have
to Ieave the garbage in a
piIe before the poIice arrive.

40:21.943 --> 40:23.433
This is gonna be fun.

40:29.017 --> 40:31.577
(HannibaI)
I want these men arrested
as cocaine deaIers.

40:31.653 --> 40:33.621
Hope you have
pIenty of empty ceIIs.

40:34.823 --> 40:36.188
Arrest them.

I toId you, you wouId
never Ieave my country aIive.

What do you want us to
do with them, Captain?

40:46.001 --> 40:47.298
Captain?

40:48.370 --> 40:51.339
Captain of PoIice.
Captain of the poIice. Great.

40:51.806 --> 40:54.104

It seems our friends are more

I suspect they're on their way
to Corson's garage to pick up
your money.

42:50.258 --> 42:52.123
Yeah, I want to go after them
by myseIf...

42:52.193 --> 42:54.423

we can tear them apart.
