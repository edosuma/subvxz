03:32.913 --> 03:33.579
Just somebody

03:33.581 --> 03:34.479
Who i could talk to.

03:34.481 --> 03:35.714
Sara gave me good advice.

03:35.716 --> 03:36.815
She told me, "you should try

03:40.154 --> 03:41.353
We came to an agreement that,

03:41.355 --> 03:42.487
You know, being separated is

03:42.489 --> 03:43.989
Something that we needed to do.

03:43.991 --> 03:45.290

03:49.363 --> 03:51.330
Things started getting crazy.

03:51.332 --> 03:52.631
We were supposed to meet.

03:52.633 --> 03:53.298
She called me

03:53.300 --> 03:54.499
Before she got on a plane.

03:54.501 --> 03:55.567
She messaged me saying

03:55.569 --> 03:56.668
How excited she was.

03:56.670 --> 03:57.436
She couldn't sit still

03:57.438 --> 03:58.470
In her seat.

03:58.472 --> 03:59.371
About 40 minutes

03:59.373 --> 04:00.305
Before being there,

04:00.307 --> 04:01.240
I didn't hear anything from her.

04:01.242 --> 04:02.841
No text, nothing.

04:02.843 --> 04:04.509
It was about 24 hours after

04:04.511 --> 04:06.345
That i finally got ahold of her,

04:06.347 --> 04:07.479
And she told me that she had

04:07.481 --> 04:09.114
A seizure and her mom came

04:09.116 --> 04:09.848
And picked her up and took

04:09.850 --> 04:11.350
Her back to oklahoma city.

04:11.352 --> 04:12.784
She always came up with excuses

04:12.786 --> 04:14.086
Why we could not meet.

04:14.088 --> 04:16.120
Stories of kidnapping,

04:16.123 --> 04:17.055
Hypothermia.

04:17.057 --> 04:18.055
That's pretty much where i had

04:18.058 --> 04:19.725
The last straw of it all.

04:19.726 --> 04:20.425
I'm wanna figure out

04:20.427 --> 04:21.459
Who this real person is.

04:21.462 --> 04:23.061
So i kept doing research,

04:23.063 --> 04:26.265
And i found a profile of ashley,

04:26.267 --> 04:27.966
And everything that she posted

04:27.968 --> 04:29.101
On her real profile

04:29.103 --> 04:30.202
She also posted

04:30.204 --> 04:31.770
On her fake profile.

04:31.772 --> 04:32.704
>> plus, you actually

04:32.706 --> 04:33.972
Found the girl in the photos.

04:33.974 --> 04:34.673
>> i did.

04:34.675 --> 04:36.441
I messaged the real sara.

04:36.443 --> 04:37.876
I told her about ashley

04:37.878 --> 04:39.778
And my wife and everything,

04:39.780 --> 04:41.113
And that's when sara marie

04:41.115 --> 04:42.781
Told me that ashley

04:42.783 --> 04:44.149
Has been using her pictures

04:44.151 --> 04:45.684
And her name for seven years

04:45.686 --> 04:46.685
As a catfish.

04:46.687 --> 04:47.919
>> wow.

04:47.921 --> 04:49.554
>> so i figured this

04:49.556 --> 04:50.722
Happened to me for a reason.

04:50.724 --> 04:52.591
Maybe this is the reason.

04:52.593 --> 04:54.259
If i can help sara put a stop

04:54.261 --> 04:56.194
To it, i'm gonna do it.

04:56.196 --> 04:56.862
>> does your wife

04:56.864 --> 04:58.664

04:58.666 --> 04:59.398
And this whole situation?

04:59.400 --> 04:59.998
>> yes.

05:00.000 --> 05:01.133
It hurt her that i had moved on

05:01.135 --> 05:03.068
As fast as i did.

05:03.070 --> 05:04.403
I believe this is punishment

05:04.405 --> 05:05.070
For me.

05:05.072 --> 05:08.373
I believe i deserve this,

05:08.375 --> 05:10.475
Because she didn't deserve that.

05:10.477 --> 05:11.710
>> so basically,

05:11.712 --> 05:13.278
You feel like a sinner

For having

05:14.214 --> 05:15.614

>> yes.

06:23.484 --> 06:23.816
Officer.

06:23.817 --> 06:24.149
>> this is some

06:24.151 --> 06:25.050
<i>True detective</i> [bleep].

06:25.052 --> 06:27.719
>> this sure is.

06:27.721 --> 06:29.121
[doorbell dings]

06:29.123 --> 06:29.788
Hey.

06:29.790 --> 06:30.455
>> hey.

06:30.457 --> 06:31.123
>> hey.

06:31.125 --> 06:31.790
>> there he is.

06:31.792 --> 06:32.491
>> how's it going?

06:32.493 --> 06:33.125
>> wow.

06:33.127 --> 06:34.292
>> do you guys have a vampire

06:34.294 --> 06:36.027
Problem around here?

06:36.029 --> 06:38.130
>> you took it off the wall?

06:38.132 --> 06:39.297
What are you doing, max?

06:39.299 --> 06:40.832
Get out of here. What is this?

06:40.834 --> 06:41.733
Max turns into

06:41.735 --> 06:43.034
A christian crusader

06:43.036 --> 06:45.237
Against vampires.

06:45.239 --> 06:45.904
All right.

06:45.906 --> 06:47.005
So start at the beginning,

06:47.007 --> 06:48.039
Which was at a couple years ago.

06:48.041 --> 06:48.840
Things with you and your wife

06:48.842 --> 06:50.041
Started to get a little--

06:50.043 --> 06:51.143
>> i'm not sure if it was really

06:51.145 --> 06:52.644
With her or with myself,

06:52.646 --> 06:53.578
But it kind of put me

06:53.580 --> 06:54.479
Into the point

06:54.481 --> 06:55.147
To where it made me

06:55.149 --> 06:56.615
Look back on my life

06:56.617 --> 06:58.517
As far as, "where is this going?

06:58.519 --> 06:59.785
What am i doing?

06:59.787 --> 07:00.886
Why haven't i done the things

07:00.888 --> 07:02.521
That i've always wanted to do?"

07:02.523 --> 07:03.855
For two years, i battled it,

07:03.857 --> 07:05.457
But it got to the point

07:05.459 --> 07:07.526
To where i needed somebody's

07:07.528 --> 07:10.328
Perspective from the outside.

07:10.330 --> 07:12.230
So i randomly added probably

07:12.232 --> 07:13.498
About five to ten people

07:13.500 --> 07:15.200
On the people you may know,

07:15.202 --> 07:16.101
Just seeing if somebody

07:16.103 --> 07:17.169
Would actually talk to me.

07:17.171 --> 07:18.203
And it was guys, girls.

07:18.205 --> 07:19.571
It wasn't nothing particular

07:19.573 --> 07:20.572
That i was looking for.

07:20.574 --> 07:22.741
But only one messaged me back,

07:22.743 --> 07:25.343
Sara jackson.

07:25.345 --> 07:26.978
Sara told me, "tell your wife

07:26.980 --> 07:28.046
How you feel,

07:28.048 --> 07:29.347
But i think even

07:29.349 --> 07:30.782
For the sake of your kids,

07:30.784 --> 07:32.417
Y'all need to work things out."

07:32.419 --> 07:33.919
After i told my wife everything,

07:33.921 --> 07:34.920
My wife came clean, "look,

07:34.922 --> 07:36.555
I've--honestly, i could tell

07:36.557 --> 07:37.456
That you've been unhappy

07:37.458 --> 07:38.990
For the past couple years,

07:38.992 --> 07:40.125
And to be honest with you,

07:40.127 --> 07:41.460
I have been too."

07:41.462 --> 07:42.627
I mean, i later found out that

07:42.629 --> 07:44.429
She didn't want me to see it,

07:44.431 --> 07:46.465
That she was brokenhearted.

07:46.467 --> 07:47.499
I didn't know that she

07:47.501 --> 07:49.167
Would cry behind the door.

07:49.169 --> 07:50.035
I guess she thought

07:50.037 --> 07:51.503
That i was too far gone,

07:51.505 --> 07:52.304
That it didn't matter

07:52.306 --> 07:53.472
What she told me.

07:53.474 --> 07:54.339
>> so here you are now.

07:54.341 --> 07:55.407
It's been a few months

07:55.409 --> 07:56.808
Of you and your wife sort of

07:56.810 --> 07:57.642
Taking some space

07:57.644 --> 07:58.310
From each other

07:58.312 --> 07:59.811
At which point things with sara

07:59.813 --> 08:00.812
Are progressing to the point

08:00.814 --> 08:01.513
Where you're trying

08:01.515 --> 08:02.147
To meet up with her.

08:02.149 --> 08:02.981
>> mm-hmm.

08:02.983 --> 08:04.549
>> but all this drama kind

08:04.551 --> 08:05.617
Of starts to happen.

08:05.619 --> 08:06.651
>> after the whole seizure

08:06.653 --> 08:08.753
Thing, these stories

08:08.755 --> 08:09.988
Even got crazier.

08:09.990 --> 08:11.289
I was on the phone with her.

08:11.291 --> 08:12.123
All of a sudden, she starts

08:12.125 --> 08:13.425
Hearing banging on the door,

08:13.427 --> 08:14.226
And she looked,

08:14.228 --> 08:17.629
And she said, "oh, it's my ex."

08:17.631 --> 08:18.930
I heard glass break.

08:18.932 --> 08:20.465
She's sitting there frightened,

08:20.467 --> 08:23.101
Like she's fixing to die.

08:23.103 --> 08:24.102
>> this is crazy, though,

08:24.104 --> 08:25.303
That you're, like, on the phone

08:25.305 --> 08:26.304
With someone as they may

08:26.306 --> 08:28.206
Or may not be murdered.

08:28.208 --> 08:28.907
>> i heard cops

08:28.909 --> 08:29.741
In the background.

08:29.743 --> 08:30.742
I heard the radios.

08:30.744 --> 08:31.977
I'm around radios

08:31.979 --> 08:33.278
Like that all the time.

08:33.280 --> 08:35.080
All of this went up

08:35.082 --> 08:36.548
Until about 4:00 in the morning,

08:36.549 --> 08:38.683
And the phone--the call dropped.

08:38.684 --> 08:39.417
>> you must have felt,

08:39.419 --> 08:40.652
Like, totally helpless.

08:40.654 --> 08:41.620
>> i couldn't do anything.

08:41.621 --> 08:42.554
Before this,

08:42.556 --> 08:43.889
She had given me her mom's phone

08:43.890 --> 08:44.990
Number for some reason.

08:44.992 --> 08:46.124
I wind up calling her mom.

08:46.126 --> 08:46.825
She didn't answer,

08:46.827 --> 08:48.093
So i left a text message.

08:48.095 --> 08:49.728
"hey, is sara okay?"

08:49.730 --> 08:51.129
I called every police department

08:51.131 --> 08:52.063
In the vicinity

08:52.065 --> 08:52.864
Of oklahoma city.

08:52.866 --> 08:53.832
I wind up getting ahold of

08:53.834 --> 08:55.500
The missing persons department.

08:55.502 --> 08:56.635
I mention the name.

08:56.637 --> 08:58.136
No name has came across.

08:58.138 --> 08:59.905
No sara jackson.

08:59.907 --> 09:01.740
Not even 20 to 30 minutes later,

09:01.742 --> 09:02.807
Her mom said,

09:02.809 --> 09:04.209
"oh, sara's in bed.

09:04.211 --> 09:05.143
She looks beat up.

09:05.145 --> 09:06.177
Her lip is busted."

09:06.179 --> 09:07.212
>> you talked to her mom?

09:07.214 --> 09:07.979
>> not on the phone.

09:07.981 --> 09:08.713
>> not on the phone.

09:08.715 --> 09:09.381
>> i text.

09:09.383 --> 09:10.115
>> she's putting you

09:10.117 --> 09:11.016
Through the wringer.

09:11.018 --> 09:12.918
>> i had enough,

09:12.920 --> 09:14.386
So i reversed sara's number,

09:14.388 --> 09:16.087
Came back with her stepdad,

09:16.089 --> 09:16.955
Donald.

09:16.957 --> 09:17.656
Through donald,

09:17.658 --> 09:19.357
I found an obituary

09:19.359 --> 09:20.959
That was in oklahoma,

09:20.961 --> 09:22.160
So i looked at the first female

09:22.162 --> 09:22.827
Grandchildren,

09:22.829 --> 09:24.329
And i found ashley there.

09:24.331 --> 09:25.397
I took ashley's name,

09:25.399 --> 09:26.598
Went on the search engine,

09:26.600 --> 09:27.699
Found her profile,

09:27.701 --> 09:29.134
And found that she posts

09:29.136 --> 09:30.001
The exact same things

09:30.003 --> 09:30.669
That she posted

09:30.671 --> 09:32.370
On sara's profile.

09:32.372 --> 09:33.238
So i took a couple

09:33.240 --> 09:34.306
Of sara jackson's pictures...

09:34.308 --> 09:35.006
>> right.

09:35.008 --> 09:35.674
>> and reversed them.

09:35.676 --> 09:36.708
Soon as i did it,

09:36.710 --> 09:38.410
Sara's profile popped up.

09:38.412 --> 09:39.611
>> the real sara.

09:39.613 --> 09:40.278
>> yes.

09:40.280 --> 09:42.614
I get to this profile status

09:42.616 --> 09:44.082
That says, "i am being

09:44.084 --> 09:45.884
Used again by ashley.

09:45.886 --> 09:47.519
#nevhelpme.

09:47.521 --> 09:49.054
#catfish."

09:49.056 --> 09:49.721
I'm serious.

09:49.723 --> 09:51.523
>> so your sense of justice

09:51.525 --> 09:53.325
Was awakened.

09:53.327 --> 09:54.125
>> right.

09:54.127 --> 09:55.794
Everything that's happened to me

09:55.796 --> 09:56.761
With this catfish,

09:56.763 --> 09:57.896
I believe that i

09:57.898 --> 09:59.497
Wholeheartedly deserve it.

09:59.499 --> 10:01.232
>> why are you whipping yourself

10:01.234 --> 10:02.133
Over this stuff?

10:02.135 --> 10:03.902
Like, you already got punished.

10:03.904 --> 10:04.736
Seems like the thing

10:04.738 --> 10:06.504
You really need to do is,

10:06.506 --> 10:08.873
Like, do what needs to be done

10:08.875 --> 10:10.241
In regards to the people

10:10.243 --> 10:12.110
Who probably need your help

10:12.112 --> 10:15.046
The most--your wife, your kids.

10:15.048 --> 10:16.815
>> we actually have been

10:16.817 --> 10:17.882
Trying to work things out,

10:17.884 --> 10:18.850
Especially for our kids.

10:18.852 --> 10:19.517
>> so are things

10:19.519 --> 10:20.719
With your wife much better?

10:20.721 --> 10:21.386
>> yeah.

10:21.388 --> 10:22.487
We're communicating now.

10:22.489 --> 10:24.389
I kept asking my wife, "do you

10:24.391 --> 10:26.524
Think me doing this is crazy?"

10:26.526 --> 10:27.325
She told me, "you've come

10:27.327 --> 10:27.993
This far.

10:27.995 --> 10:28.827
Why not finish

10:28.829 --> 10:29.494
What you started?"

10:29.496 --> 10:30.595
My purpose for this whole thing

10:30.597 --> 10:31.863
Is to try to pull something

10:31.865 --> 10:35.100
Positive from this negative.

10:35.102 --> 10:36.468
>> what do you have to show us?

10:36.470 --> 10:37.869
Do you have pictures of ashley?

10:37.871 --> 10:39.304
>> this is all i have of her.

10:39.306 --> 10:40.939
>> this is the current ashley

10:40.941 --> 10:41.673
Profile.

10:41.675 --> 10:42.807
Can we see anything else?

10:42.809 --> 10:43.475
>> that's it.

10:43.477 --> 10:44.142
>> that's it.

10:44.144 --> 10:45.644
She's got one cover photo.

10:45.646 --> 10:47.479
Everything is private.

10:47.481 --> 10:49.114
It's safe to assume that this is

10:49.116 --> 10:50.649
Something ashley's very good at,

10:50.651 --> 10:52.017
The other characters,

10:52.019 --> 10:52.851
Someone breaking into the house.

10:52.853 --> 10:53.485
>> breaking glass.

10:53.487 --> 10:54.719
>> her getting kidnapped.

10:54.721 --> 10:57.522
>> she is making an art of this.

10:57.524 --> 10:58.189
>> yeah.

10:58.191 --> 10:58.890
There's so many guys

10:58.892 --> 11:00.659
That have been victims,

11:00.661 --> 11:01.326
And how many

11:01.328 --> 11:02.927
More is going to be victims?

11:02.929 --> 11:03.595
What if this goes

11:03.597 --> 11:05.263
Beyond catfishing one day?

11:05.265 --> 11:05.930
>> right.

11:05.932 --> 11:07.098
>> and she can actually steal

11:07.100 --> 11:08.133
People's identities?

11:08.135 --> 11:08.800
>> right.

11:08.802 --> 11:09.868
Who knows what this game--

11:09.870 --> 11:11.169
Her game could be?

11:11.171 --> 11:12.737
>> send us all that information.

11:12.739 --> 11:14.039
Put it in an email.

11:14.041 --> 11:14.939
>> sounds good.

11:14.941 --> 11:15.707
>> good to meet you.

11:15.709 --> 11:16.975
>> you too, man.

11:16.977 --> 11:19.644
>> hang in there.

11:19.646 --> 11:22.313
All right.

11:22.315 --> 11:23.848
I wasn't totally convinced

11:23.850 --> 11:24.749
Before we got there

11:24.751 --> 11:26.217
What this guy's motives were,

11:26.219 --> 11:28.219
But now that i've heard

11:28.221 --> 11:29.921
How dire things were,

11:29.923 --> 11:31.089
I get why he now

11:31.091 --> 11:33.058
Feels more of an obligation.

11:33.060 --> 11:33.925
>> this girl knew he had

11:33.927 --> 11:34.926
A family.

11:34.928 --> 11:36.327
His whole life could've been

11:36.329 --> 11:37.395
Ruined.

11:41.100 --> 11:42.767
>> nice.

11:42.769 --> 11:43.435
>> this place is cool.

11:43.437 --> 11:44.502
>> hey, guys.

11:44.504 --> 11:45.370
Oh, no. What happened?

11:45.372 --> 11:46.337
>> a boy.

11:46.339 --> 11:47.872
He squeezed my hand,

11:47.874 --> 11:49.007
And it popped out of place.

11:49.009 --> 11:49.708
>> what boy?

11:49.710 --> 11:51.843
>> a boy? On--like, on a date?

11:51.845 --> 11:52.644
Squeezed your hand?

11:52.646 --> 11:53.845
>> no. No, no, no, no.

11:53.847 --> 11:55.380
>> after we're done figuring out

11:55.382 --> 11:56.181
Who this catfish is,

11:56.183 --> 11:57.248
We're gonna find this guy

11:57.250 --> 11:58.083
And kick his ass.

11:58.085 --> 11:59.617
>> okay.

11:59.619 --> 12:00.418
>> we've got

12:00.420 --> 12:01.519
An interesting story here.

12:01.521 --> 12:02.187
>> mm-hmm.

12:02.189 --> 12:02.987
>> thaddius,

12:02.989 --> 12:03.988
Who's married with kids,

12:03.990 --> 12:05.290
Struggling in his relationship

12:05.292 --> 12:06.324
With his wife, ends up talking

12:06.326 --> 12:07.726
To this girl, sara jackson.

12:07.728 --> 12:09.360
Not too far into it,

12:09.362 --> 12:10.895
He starts feeling for her.

12:10.897 --> 12:12.030
She admits she's feeling things

12:12.032 --> 12:12.697
For him.

12:12.699 --> 12:13.732
They make a whole plan to meet.

12:13.734 --> 12:14.833
It doesn't happen, so--

12:14.835 --> 12:16.101
>> he decides to take matters

12:16.103 --> 12:17.235
Into his own hands.

12:17.237 --> 12:18.536
>> so he figures out,

12:18.538 --> 12:20.472
At least he thinks, who the real

12:20.474 --> 12:21.473
Girl he's been talking to is.

12:21.475 --> 12:22.407
This girl, ashley.

12:22.409 --> 12:23.675
He also thinks he finds the girl

12:23.677 --> 12:25.009
In the pictures, sara marie.

12:25.011 --> 12:26.277
Now what he wants to do

12:26.279 --> 12:27.378
Is confront ashley

12:27.380 --> 12:28.646
And encourage her to stop

12:28.648 --> 12:29.514
For her own good

12:29.516 --> 12:30.515
And for the well-being

12:30.517 --> 12:32.350
Of others as well.

12:32.352 --> 12:33.017
All right, max.

12:33.019 --> 12:34.486
You ready? Here we go.

This definitely feels

12:52.539 --> 12:54.472
Like a legit profile.

12:54.474 --> 12:55.140
Why don't we just

At this point,

15:24.324 --> 15:26.090
I don't think she realizes

15:26.092 --> 15:27.592
That i am a real person.

She's told me

15:30.530 --> 15:31.462
She was gonna stop.

15:31.464 --> 15:33.498
She clearly hasn't stopped.

15:33.500 --> 15:34.399
I just want to stand in front

15:34.401 --> 15:35.700
Of her and have her look at me

15:35.702 --> 15:36.968
For, like, two minutes

15:36.970 --> 15:38.436
And realize, "oh, my gosh.

15:38.438 --> 15:39.704
This is a real person."

15:39.706 --> 15:40.972
>> well, what we're starting

15:40.974 --> 15:41.706
To realize here

15:41.708 --> 15:42.874
Is that this girl is leaving

15:42.876 --> 15:44.275
A real wake of destruction.

15:44.277 --> 15:44.943
>> yeah.

15:44.945 --> 15:45.610
>> so i think it

15:45.612 --> 15:47.178

That we get as many people

15:48.315 --> 15:49.213
That she's messed with

In front of her to, like,

She's doing is really messed up.

With him to make sure

16:46.172 --> 16:48.606
He was cool with sara coming,

16:48.608 --> 16:50.675
Because it's gonna

Be a little weird.

For a while,

And things with his wife

17:59.312 --> 18:00.011
>> max you know.

18:00.013 --> 18:02.814
Let's go inside.

18:02.816 --> 18:04.048
>> here we are.

18:04.050 --> 18:05.917
>> okay.

18:07.653 --> 18:08.653
>> [laughs]

18:08.655 --> 18:09.854
Like, this is so awkward.

18:09.856 --> 18:10.521
>> what is it?

18:10.523 --> 18:11.255
Is it--is it weird?

18:11.257 --> 18:12.857
>> it's definitely awkward.

18:12.859 --> 18:13.558
>> it is awkward.

18:13.560 --> 18:15.593
It's awkward for me to meet her

18:15.595 --> 18:16.794
'cause she was not

18:16.796 --> 18:17.829
Who i was talking to.

18:17.831 --> 18:18.496
>> can we hear

18:18.498 --> 18:20.531
Why it's awkward for you?

18:20.533 --> 18:22.500
>> just having countless guys

18:22.502 --> 18:23.501
Find you and think

18:23.503 --> 18:24.469
That they were in love with--

18:24.471 --> 18:25.436
It's just the weirdest.

18:25.438 --> 18:26.504
It's awkward.

18:26.506 --> 18:27.171
>> yeah.

18:27.173 --> 18:29.373
>> why don't you give us

18:29.375 --> 18:31.075
Your whole side of the story?

18:31.077 --> 18:31.876
>> okay.

18:31.878 --> 18:32.543
I'm not sure

18:32.545 --> 18:34.011
How long it's gone on for.

18:34.013 --> 18:36.380
It first came to my attention

18:36.382 --> 18:37.815
Back in 2010.

18:37.817 --> 18:39.884
I received an email

18:39.886 --> 18:41.452
From a guy named sam.

18:41.454 --> 18:43.187
"hey, sara, i have wasted

18:43.189 --> 18:44.255
Almost a year of my life

18:44.257 --> 18:45.022
Talking to a girl

18:45.024 --> 18:46.290
That claims she is you.

18:46.292 --> 18:47.258
Can you help me clarify

18:47.260 --> 18:48.159
Who you are?"

18:48.161 --> 18:50.761
So i was quick to write my url

18:50.763 --> 18:51.496
On a piece of paper

18:51.498 --> 18:53.598
And take a picture of it.

18:53.600 --> 18:55.666
Sam emailed me back.

18:55.668 --> 18:56.434
"i can't believe this.

18:56.436 --> 18:57.502
Thanks for taking those photos.

18:57.504 --> 18:58.603
I feel like a fool."

18:58.605 --> 18:59.770
We exchange phone numbers,

18:59.772 --> 19:01.339
And i type it in my phone.

19:01.341 --> 19:03.441
Then, i would say probably

19:03.443 --> 19:05.376
About three years later,

19:05.378 --> 19:06.711
I get a friend request

19:06.713 --> 19:08.112
From a guy named joe.

19:08.114 --> 19:10.214
And joe was in a relationship

19:10.216 --> 19:11.516
With me,

19:11.518 --> 19:12.717
And i thought that was

19:12.719 --> 19:13.417
The weirdest thing ever.

19:13.419 --> 19:14.051
I'm like,

19:14.053 --> 19:14.986
"who is this guy in florida

19:14.988 --> 19:16.154
That thinks he's dating me?"

19:16.156 --> 19:16.854
So me and joe

19:16.856 --> 19:18.356
Start going back and forth,

19:18.358 --> 19:19.223
And i explained to him,

19:19.225 --> 19:19.891
"this girl's been

19:19.893 --> 19:20.958
Impersonating me,

19:20.960 --> 19:22.627
And i want some information

19:22.629 --> 19:23.461
On her."

19:23.463 --> 19:24.562
Like, you know,

19:24.564 --> 19:25.229
"where does she live?

19:25.231 --> 19:26.130
I want her phone number."

19:26.132 --> 19:27.398
He gives me the phone number.

19:27.400 --> 19:28.633
I type it in my phone,

19:28.635 --> 19:31.135
And it's saved under sam.

19:31.137 --> 19:32.803
She was pretending to be sam

19:32.805 --> 19:35.740
To try to get my photos.

19:35.742 --> 19:36.440
>> wow.

19:36.442 --> 19:37.475
>> i was like, "whoa.

19:37.477 --> 19:39.043
I just got played."

19:39.045 --> 19:41.212
>> this was actually ashley

19:41.214 --> 19:43.481
Behind this sam profile.

19:43.483 --> 19:44.415
>> that's sick.

19:44.417 --> 19:46.617
>> why? Why?

19:46.619 --> 19:47.518
>> at that point,

19:47.520 --> 19:50.054
Joe sent me this picture.

19:50.056 --> 19:51.489
>> she is manipulating you

19:51.491 --> 19:52.657
To take a picture.

19:52.659 --> 19:53.324
>> and write

19:53.326 --> 19:54.358
Whatever she wants on it.

19:54.360 --> 19:55.526
>> she photoshopped

19:55.528 --> 19:57.228
The social media accounts.

19:57.230 --> 19:58.396
>> pretty good job.

19:58.398 --> 19:59.197
I mean, like, the angle and--

19:59.199 --> 19:59.764
>> so creepy.

19:59.766 --> 20:01.065
>> i mean, that would--

20:01.067 --> 20:02.667
If i was asking for evidence

20:02.669 --> 20:03.601
About something

20:03.603 --> 20:04.869
And she sent me that, i would--

20:04.871 --> 20:05.570
>> really?

20:05.572 --> 20:06.504
>> i would buy it.

20:06.506 --> 20:07.338
>> it's gotten to the point

20:07.340 --> 20:07.939
Where

20:07.941 --> 20:08.773
I've had everything private

20:08.775 --> 20:09.874
And she still gets in there.

20:09.876 --> 20:10.741
She has pictures

20:10.743 --> 20:11.576
That i posted up.

20:11.578 --> 20:12.276
Like, my friends

20:12.278 --> 20:13.511
Have posted of me.

20:13.513 --> 20:15.346
Like, she's deep into this.

20:15.348 --> 20:16.013
>> yeah.

20:16.015 --> 20:16.948
>> and i'm telling you hundreds.

20:16.950 --> 20:17.582
I'm not even--

20:17.584 --> 20:18.716
I'm not saying just a couple.

20:18.718 --> 20:19.483
I mean hundreds

20:19.485 --> 20:20.618
Of photos of you.

20:20.620 --> 20:22.286
>> it's so much deeper than her

20:22.288 --> 20:23.621
Just taking my photos.

20:23.623 --> 20:25.623
It's my sister and my niece.

20:25.625 --> 20:27.858
>> 11 years old? 12 years old?

20:27.860 --> 20:29.260
>> yeah. 12. Oh, my god.

20:29.262 --> 20:29.927
That's so crazy

20:29.929 --> 20:30.761
That she knows that.

20:30.763 --> 20:32.563
See? That's--

20:32.565 --> 20:33.497
>> like, honestly, sara,

20:33.499 --> 20:34.765
I think she believes that she

20:34.767 --> 20:36.934
Is you when she talks to people.

20:36.936 --> 20:38.769
>> i sometimes think that too,

20:38.771 --> 20:39.770
But then at the same time,

20:39.772 --> 20:40.438
I don't think

20:40.440 --> 20:41.539
She thinks i'm a real person.

20:41.541 --> 20:42.206
>> i think

20:42.208 --> 20:43.641
That she uses that persona

20:43.643 --> 20:46.010
To either run away from her life

20:46.012 --> 20:46.911
Or what's going on.

20:46.913 --> 20:47.578
I don't know,

20:47.580 --> 20:50.214
But this is ridiculous.

20:50.216 --> 20:51.282
>> yeah.

20:51.284 --> 20:52.283
>> all right, so we

20:52.285 --> 20:53.651
Did some research yesterday.

20:53.653 --> 20:54.552
So we started here.

20:54.554 --> 20:55.219
We just did

20:55.221 --> 20:56.287
A basic google search,

20:56.289 --> 20:57.688
And the first, like,

20:57.690 --> 20:58.356
Couple things

20:58.358 --> 20:59.190
That show up

20:59.192 --> 21:00.591
Include arrest record.

21:00.593 --> 21:02.760
She's been arrested twice,

21:02.762 --> 21:04.061
And it says "larceny

21:04.063 --> 21:05.229
Of merchandise."

21:05.231 --> 21:05.896
>> this is crazy.

21:05.898 --> 21:06.564
>> crazy.

21:06.566 --> 21:08.232
We looked up her name.

21:08.234 --> 21:09.433
It actually came back

21:09.435 --> 21:10.434
With an address,

21:10.436 --> 21:14.272
And it looks pretty current.

21:14.274 --> 21:15.973
>> i say we go confront her.

21:15.975 --> 21:17.575
Ask the questions. Why?

21:17.577 --> 21:19.277
>> we got her number,

21:19.279 --> 21:20.645
So we should call her.

21:20.647 --> 21:23.514
[phone line rings]

21:23.516 --> 21:24.548
>> at the tone,

21:24.550 --> 21:26.484

21:27.520 --> 21:29.120

21:29.122 --> 21:30.655
This is nev

21:30.657 --> 21:33.124
From the mtv show,<i> catfish.</i>

21:33.126 --> 21:34.692
I have some questions, so give

21:34.694 --> 21:37.328
Me a call back and hopefully

21:37.330 --> 21:39.096
We will speak soon.

21:39.098 --> 21:41.332
Thanks.

21:41.334 --> 21:42.266
Now, we wait.

21:42.268 --> 21:42.933
>> what happens

21:42.935 --> 21:44.335
If she doesn't contact?

21:44.337 --> 21:45.336
>> we have her address.

21:45.338 --> 21:46.304
>> we know where she lives.

21:46.306 --> 21:47.471
>> we should just go.

21:47.473 --> 21:49.507
>> if i were her, really.

21:49.509 --> 21:51.542
>> i would run.

21:54.579 --> 21:59.083
>> whoo.
>> and we're back.

21:59.085 --> 22:00.101
>> and we're back.

22:00.102 --> 22:01.118
So here we are.

22:01.120 --> 22:03.621
Ashley never replied back

22:03.623 --> 22:04.288
Or called back,

22:04.290 --> 22:06.424
So we came to the conclusion

22:06.426 --> 22:08.292
Of just showing up at her place.

22:08.294 --> 22:09.193
I don't know what's going to

22:09.195 --> 22:12.997
Happen, to be honest with you.

22:12.999 --> 22:16.133
I've come this far, though.

22:16.135 --> 22:19.003
I'm not gonna give up just yet.

22:19.005 --> 22:20.671
>> okc.

22:20.673 --> 22:21.706
>> she didn't get back to us,

22:21.708 --> 22:22.840
So there's nothing left to do

22:22.842 --> 22:24.041
But to just go.

22:24.043 --> 22:24.709
>> you guys ready?

22:24.711 --> 22:25.376
>> i'm ready.

22:25.378 --> 22:26.043
>> yeah.

22:26.045 --> 22:26.711
>> yo.

23:01.147 --> 23:02.646
Pretty effective

23:02.648 --> 23:04.615
At acting anyway.

23:04.617 --> 23:06.317
People who are crippled by guilt

23:06.319 --> 23:08.486
Certainly wouldn't have written

23:08.488 --> 23:10.020
Into a tv show

23:10.022 --> 23:12.156
In which they went on camera

23:12.158 --> 23:13.758
And talked about the things

23:13.760 --> 23:14.592
They were guilty of.

23:14.594 --> 23:15.493
You're actually a lot

23:19.899 --> 23:21.132
I feel good.

23:21.134 --> 23:23.067
>> why are you feeling good now?

23:23.069 --> 23:24.268

23:29.942 --> 23:30.708

23:47.794 --> 23:49.026
This moment

23:49.028 --> 23:53.063
Of just getting in her face.

23:53.065 --> 23:55.132
Just saying, "look, this is me."

24:01.941 --> 24:03.974
Or this whoever it is,

24:03.976 --> 24:04.975
They might really freak out.

24:04.977 --> 24:06.577
Like, this could be

24:06.579 --> 24:08.312
Not cool for them.

24:08.314 --> 24:09.113
>> yeah.

24:09.115 --> 24:10.414
>> and just the fact

We're making a show

24:12.285 --> 24:14.151
About them probably--

24:14.153 --> 24:15.519
