06:02.936 --> 06:04.839

I thought he had a train to catch.

06:19.719 --> 06:23.522
Yeah, I went to his motel to take
him to the station. He wasn't there.

06:23.555 --> 06:25.658
Maybe he doesn't like saying good-byes.

06:25.691 --> 06:28.226

last night at the Forge

06:34.301 --> 06:35.900
talking to Proctor's niece.

06:35.933 --> 06:37.772
- Rebecca?
- Yeah.

- When?
- Late.

No. Only be a minute.

- Hi.

07:47.239 --> 07:50.268
You left the Forge

07:50.301 --> 07:52.267
Late 20s, blond hair.

07:53.604 --> 07:55.771
What seems to be the problem?

07:56.740 --> 07:58.275
Well, he's missing.

07:58.308 --> 08:01.013
<i>There were, uh...</i>

08:01.046 --> 08:02.916
signs of struggle in his motel room.

08:02.949 --> 08:05.449
And what would Rebecca know about that?

08:05.482 --> 08:07.015
That's what I'm here to find out.

08:07.048 --> 08:08.277
Who is this man?

08:08.318 --> 08:10.179
We don't know that yet.

08:10.212 --> 08:11.379
Do you have a name?

08:11.411 --> 08:13.746
So you're gonna try and tell me that

08:13.787 --> 08:15.554
you don't know him?

08:15.587 --> 08:17.985
I don't know him.

08:18.018 --> 08:19.553
I did fuck him, though.

08:21.825 --> 08:25.296
We don't always know the
people we fuck, do we?

08:32.568 --> 08:34.471
So...

08:34.504 --> 08:37.270
you were in his motel room, right?

08:37.303 --> 08:39.773
<i>- For a little bit.
- How long?</i>

08:40.942 --> 08:42.438
I left after he fell asleep.

08:42.479 --> 08:44.774
- Your uncle come pick you up?
- Was there a crime committed?

08:44.807 --> 08:47.079
No, I'm just trying to
make a timeline here.

08:47.144 --> 08:49.981
Why don't you tell me what happened?

08:50.014 --> 08:52.213
- What happened?
- Are you accusing us of something...

08:52.254 --> 08:55.823
- Why would I do that?
- No, indeed, why would you do that?

08:55.856 --> 08:58.621
You have no evidence, no body.

08:58.654 --> 09:01.429
There's not even a name, you say.

09:01.462 --> 09:04.462
It doesn't sound to me
there's a crime committed...

09:04.495 --> 09:06.460
was there?

09:07.732 --> 09:10.234
Are you sure you don't
want anything to eat?

09:15.201 --> 09:17.368
You going along with this?

09:25.008 --> 09:27.079
He said he was leaving town.

09:27.112 --> 09:28.848
I assume he did.

09:36.359 --> 09:38.656
This was your choice.

And he wanted me to know it.

11:11.130 --> 11:15.367
<i>Just because the boy
slept with his niece.</i>

Proctor.

11:50.475 --> 11:52.851
Damn.

11:52.884 --> 11:55.449
I guess we'd better get
out the gloves and shovel.

11:55.482 --> 11:57.480
I'm not burying anyone else this month.

11:57.513 --> 12:01.817
Anyone really gonna
mind if I bury Proctor?

12:03.026 --> 12:05.362
Proctor's got too much juice here.

12:24.188 --> 12:27.290
Well, you could've
fooled me this morning.

12:27.323 --> 12:32.221
What I'm saying is there's
a lot of ways to bury a man.

12:33.694 --> 12:36.630
Especially when you're
wearing that badge.

12:58.841 --> 13:00.343

13:11.190 --> 13:12.791

13:14.095 --> 13:16.756
Hypothetically...

Proctor, how would you do it?

13:19.964 --> 13:23.266
Oh, you're gonna go after Proctor, huh?

13:23.299 --> 13:25.099
What exactly are you
gonna take him down for?

13:25.164 --> 13:26.667
Anything.

13:26.700 --> 13:28.203
Everything.

13:28.236 --> 13:30.236
Yeah, I think I'm gonna need
you to be a little more specific.

13:30.269 --> 13:31.909
- You know what? Forget it.
- Listen, Hood.

13:31.942 --> 13:33.880
Proctor's got his fingers
in everything around here...

13:33.913 --> 13:36.417
prostitution, drugs, extortion.

13:36.451 --> 13:38.450
The problem is, he's
always one step removed.

13:38.491 --> 13:39.859
There's no direct ties,

13:39.892 --> 13:42.830
and he knows exactly
how to walk that line.

13:42.863 --> 13:44.232
So, good luck.

If I were sheriff...

13:58.913 --> 14:01.019
I'd start by shaking his trees.

14:03.124 --> 14:07.662
- Which trees?
- All of 'em, repeatedly, over and over

14:07.695 --> 14:10.196
till something we can
use falls out of them.

14:10.229 --> 14:13.226
<i>- Something we can use?
- Come on, Hood.</i>

14:13.267 --> 14:16.300

you have all the fun, do you?

with a no-confidence vote.

- Do you know who owns this place?
- Sure do.

18:20.809 --> 18:22.867

to the cops. - Yeah, not anymore.

You two, out the front now.

19:05.870 --> 19:08.234
Picked a bad night, Gordon.

19:08.267 --> 19:10.466
We're busting the
place for prostitution.

19:10.531 --> 19:12.736
Well, that's crack
detective work, Sheriff.

19:12.769 --> 19:15.505
I mean, it's only
Banshee's worst-kept secret.

19:19.344 --> 19:21.806

- Hey, trust me, asshole. It's not for you.
- Yeah, fuck you.

I wouldn't take it personally.

21:48.332 --> 21:51.666
Just gonna ask you a couple of
questions. Shouldn't take too long.

21:51.699 --> 21:54.263
Sorry, just to clarify, where did
you say you went to law school?

21:54.304 --> 21:56.599
Did you see somebody pay me
to stick his dick in my ass?

21:56.639 --> 21:58.005
- No.
- No, thank God.

21:58.070 --> 21:59.898
So, what do I know about a
fucking prostitution ring?

21:59.939 --> 22:01.569
All right, so let me just confirm,

22:01.602 --> 22:03.073
your name is Platinum?

22:03.106 --> 22:05.567
Platinumm. Two Ms. Platinumm.

22:05.640 --> 22:08.103
- Platinumm.
- Like, "Mm, she looked good."

they didn't know anything

22:09.608 --> 22:11.376

The smart ones won't even admit
to that until they lawyer up.

We caught some of them in the act.

22:18.687 --> 22:20.487
Well, they say they were acting alone.

<i>- They claim Proctor didn't know anything about it.
- This is fucking ridiculous.</i>

22:23.322 --> 22:26.057
Yes, it is, and that's why
they call it police work.

Excuse me, I'm looking
for my son, Max Hopewell.

- Max...
- Hopewell. He has asthma and he...

- Yes.

Dr. Kessler, I'm the resident on duty.

23:57.898 --> 23:59.563
- How is he?
- Max is stable.

23:59.604 --> 24:01.097
He suffered from an acute attack.

24:01.130 --> 24:02.632
How?

24:02.665 --> 24:04.233
We're really good about his meds

24:04.266 --> 24:05.940
and he always has his inhaler nearby.

24:05.973 --> 24:07.909
Nobody did anything wrong.

24:07.942 --> 24:09.814
His condition is deteriorating.

24:09.847 --> 24:11.784
His medicine is no longer as effective.

24:11.817 --> 24:14.523
It looks like you already
talked to Max's pulmonologist

24:14.556 --> 24:15.986
- about leukotriene modifiers...
- Yeah.

24:16.027 --> 24:19.052
- ...beta agonists...
- Yeah, yeah, we thought...

24:19.085 --> 24:22.984
we thought we had more time
before all that was necessary.

24:23.025 --> 24:24.621
You need to talk to his doctor.

24:24.654 --> 24:27.052
I'm gonna go check on
Max. I'll be right back.

24:36.900 --> 24:39.065

Sheamus, please explain
to me why we're closed.

24:41.770 --> 24:44.201
They came in here,
they busted everybody,

24:44.234 --> 24:45.904
and they took our girls.

24:45.937 --> 24:48.134
That's basically what happened.

24:48.167 --> 24:49.734
Very unfortunate.

24:49.775 --> 24:51.702
Obviously not your fault.

24:51.743 --> 24:53.174
Just give me the arrest warrant.

24:53.207 --> 24:55.141
I'll take it up with my lawyers.

24:56.774 --> 24:59.918
- The warrant?
- Yeah, the arrest warrant.

24:59.951 --> 25:02.654
I'm sure you didn't let a bunch of cops
come in here and shut down my business

25:02.687 --> 25:04.318
without a legal arrest warrant.

25:04.352 --> 25:06.591
They just came through the

I don't know what we're
gonna do about this.

25:58.078 --> 26:00.085
We're gonna talk to the
insurance company again.

26:00.118 --> 26:01.980
They've gotta be
willing to pay for more.

26:02.021 --> 26:04.991
They say that Max's asthma
has a chronic condition limit,

26:05.024 --> 26:06.927
and if they don't think the
asthma's gonna get any better,

26:06.960 --> 26:09.760
then they're not gonna
approve new treatment.

26:13.462 --> 26:16.332
We're just gonna have to pay
for the treatments ourselves.

26:16.365 --> 26:18.834
Where are we gonna get cash like that?

26:23.431 --> 26:26.636
God damn it, how did I let
things get this screwed up?

26:35.905 --> 26:38.576
You're a good father, Gordon.

26:49.779 --> 26:52.415
Juliet: They're not gonna
say anything about Proctor.

26:52.448 --> 26:54.985
They're more scared of him than you.

26:55.018 --> 26:56.650
And you're not?

26:56.691 --> 26:59.353
Proctor owns this whole town.

27:35.081 --> 27:37.088

- He pays you? - Mm-hmm,
but he calls them gifts.

27:42.530 --> 27:44.530
And what would he do if you said no?

27:44.563 --> 27:48.358
He'd get me fired from the
club and I need the money.

27:48.399 --> 27:49.861
So, what do you want to tell me?

27:49.894 --> 27:53.267
If I gave you something on Proctor,

27:53.300 --> 27:54.834
would you put him away?

27:54.868 --> 27:56.528
Could you even put him away?

27:56.601 --> 27:58.966
Depends what it is.

27:58.999 --> 28:00.935
- Would I have to testify?
- Depends what it is.

28:01.000 --> 28:03.332
Well, I won't testify, and
you have to promise me...

28:03.366 --> 28:05.604
- I can't promise you anything until I know what you've got.
- And he can't know it's me.

28:05.637 --> 28:07.940

<i>I'll do everything I can
to keep you out of it.</i>

28:20.786 --> 28:23.081
That's as close to a promise
as you're gonna get right now.

28:24.891 --> 28:26.552
No?

28:26.585 --> 28:29.225
There was this guy I used to see.

28:29.290 --> 28:31.426
[sniffles] A client.

28:33.625 --> 28:36.191
He used to drive trucks for
Proctor, running X into Philly.

- Ecstasy?
- He said Proctor has this place where they do it all...

28:38.969 --> 28:41.202
<i>cook it, pack it, and ship it off.</i>

30:52.994 --> 30:54.464
Oh, fuck.

30:58.498 --> 30:59.800
Emmett!

31:04.780 --> 31:06.412
[choking]

31:13.187 --> 31:14.753
- You all right?
- Yeah.

31:22.494 --> 31:25.998
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa. Slow down, Sharp.

31:26.031 --> 31:27.703
What do you want, cop?

31:27.736 --> 31:30.101
You're gonna tell me about
Proctor's ecstasy operation.

31:33.068 --> 31:35.203
I don't know what the
fuck you're talking about.

31:35.244 --> 31:38.877
Okay.
[groans]

31:38.910 --> 31:40.612
Let me get you started.

31:40.645 --> 31:42.948
[coughing]
You were a driver.

31:42.981 --> 31:45.082
You did runs from Banshee...

31:45.115 --> 31:46.714
[groans]

31:46.787 --> 31:48.281
...to Philly.

31:48.322 --> 31:50.089
Who told you that?

31:50.122 --> 31:53.391
<i>Well, that's none of your business.
[laughs]</i>

31:53.424 --> 31:56.562
You think I'm gonna roll on
someone like Proctor 'cause of you?

31:56.595 --> 31:58.793
Ah!

31:58.826 --> 32:00.265
<i>Go ahead, arrest me.</i>

32:00.298 --> 32:01.636
At least in jail I got my health.

32:01.669 --> 32:04.834
Yeah, but right now... 
♪ I got your arm. ♪

32:04.867 --> 32:06.305
[yells] Stop!

32:06.337 --> 32:08.640
<i>- So tell me how it works.
- Fuck you.</i>

32:08.673 --> 32:11.135
[yells] Okay.

32:11.208 --> 32:13.572
- I was just a driver.
- Yeah, we covered that.

32:13.605 --> 32:15.738
<i> Now, how did it work?
[yells]</i>

32:15.771 --> 32:17.138
It was always at night.

32:17.171 --> 32:18.940
I'd pick up the trucks from the factory,

32:18.981 --> 32:22.116
get 'em loaded, and then drive
from Banshee towards Philly.

32:22.213 --> 32:23.949
And?
[groans]

32:23.982 --> 32:26.548
All right. I'd have an address.

32:26.589 --> 32:28.786
Usually like some parking lot.

32:28.819 --> 32:31.618
I'd leave the truck with the keys
in the cab and then walk away.

32:31.659 --> 32:33.995
- And who took the trucks from there?
- I never saw anyone.

32:34.028 --> 32:35.563
The whole system's rigged with cutouts

32:35.596 --> 32:37.699
so no one knew more than they had to.

32:37.732 --> 32:39.163
But you got your orders
from Proctor, right?

32:39.196 --> 32:42.205
- I never even met him.
- Don't fuck with me, Sharp.

32:42.238 --> 32:44.608
Fuck, I'm not! I told
you, I don't know shit!

32:44.641 --> 32:47.078
I can't argue with that.
[groans]

32:47.143 --> 32:48.908
But you do know where the factory is.

32:48.941 --> 32:50.909
[yells]

32:50.942 --> 32:52.907
Oh, fuck, man.

32:52.948 --> 32:55.775
<i>Near the brick factory on Havershaw.</i>

32:55.808 --> 32:57.615
[taps]
Thanks.

33:05.317 --> 33:07.084
Hey.

33:07.117 --> 33:08.914
We're out.

33:34.349 --> 33:37.051
Well...

33:37.084 --> 33:39.852
look what the parole officer dragged in.

33:39.885 --> 33:41.591
I missed you.

33:41.624 --> 33:43.360
Oh, honey, I know.

33:43.393 --> 33:45.392
But I come bearing gifts.

33:51.200 --> 33:53.871
<i>Your cut from the truck job.</i>

33:53.904 --> 33:56.307
It's hardly retirement money...

34:01.949 --> 34:04.855
- You ain't gonna count it?
- I already know it won't be enough.

34:04.887 --> 34:07.160
Mm, you're telling me.

34:10.297 --> 34:12.264
Enough for what?

34:12.297 --> 34:13.969
I need to do another one.

34:19.003 --> 34:20.438
And I need to stop risking my fine ass

34:20.472 --> 34:21.975
over motherfucking milk money.

34:22.007 --> 34:25.775
- This one's different.
- Oh, this one's different?

34:26.942 --> 34:28.844
Then I'll gather the troops.

34:29.940 --> 34:31.978
It's gotta be just you and me.

34:33.610 --> 34:37.221
Now, we all agreed we were
gonna do this together.

34:37.254 --> 34:39.156
Moonlighting ain't my style.

34:39.188 --> 34:41.922
- I need this, Job.
- Join the motherfucking club.

34:41.955 --> 34:43.858
[whispers] It's not for me.

34:46.362 --> 34:48.090
My son is sick.

34:55.338 --> 34:58.235
Mm.

34:58.276 --> 35:01.010
Who do I have to shoot to get
a motherfucking menu in here?

35:21.359 --> 35:23.926
<i>[trucks beeping]</i>

<i>Emmett: Doesn't look very
secure for a drug lot.</i>

35:28.435 --> 35:30.666
Yeah, that's what someone
wants you to think.

35:30.707 --> 35:34.940
They got cameras covering
the perimeter there, there.

35:34.981 --> 35:38.010
17-gauge wire along the fence line.

35:38.043 --> 35:40.146
It's electrified.

35:40.179 --> 35:43.052
And they got motion sensors in the back.

35:44.621 --> 35:46.558
You can tell all that from here?

35:48.064 --> 35:49.728
Yeah, more or less.

35:49.761 --> 35:52.170
<i>Emmett: Well, we're gonna need
some time to get a warrant.</i>

35:52.203 --> 35:54.867
What do you want to do?

35:54.907 --> 35:57.043
Let's find out who owns the place.

35:57.076 --> 35:59.981
Oh, you mean do some actual
police work. Sounds good.

36:14.264 --> 36:15.895
George: Throughout our history

36:15.928 --> 36:18.262
we have stood behind brave leaders

36:18.295 --> 36:20.700
who protected our culture and traditions

36:20.733 --> 36:23.636
<i>from a world that would see us gone.</i>

36:23.669 --> 36:27.942
Alex Longshadow comes from a
line of great Kinaho chiefs.

36:27.975 --> 36:30.143
<i>No one has done more for their people</i>

36:30.176 --> 36:32.109
than Benjamin Longshadow...

36:32.142 --> 36:36.613
which is why it saddens me
that it has come to this.

36:38.380 --> 36:41.446
Alex simply lacks the
wisdom and experience

36:41.480 --> 36:46.053
to lead the Kinaho tribe
in these complicated times.

36:49.718 --> 36:51.557
That is why it is with a heavy heart

36:51.590 --> 36:54.421
<i>that I call for this
vote of no confidence</i>

36:54.462 --> 36:58.633
in Alex Longshadow as tribal chief.

36:58.666 --> 37:02.337
All in favor, raise
their hand and say, "Aye."

37:17.491 --> 37:20.755
Thompson, you're gonna let
some thug scare you away

37:20.788 --> 37:23.227
from the ideals of your ancestors?

37:25.501 --> 37:28.267
Maybe we were too harsh in our judgment.

37:28.300 --> 37:31.664
Alex is young and ambitious.

37:33.168 --> 37:35.136
Young blood may be just
what this tribe needs.

37:42.678 --> 37:46.076
You have corrupted this
council and shamed yourself

37:46.109 --> 37:47.814
as well as your father.

37:47.847 --> 37:51.184
You gonna adjourn this meeting, or what?

38:08.293 --> 38:11.027
[sighs] What'd you do
to those guys, anyway?

38:12.366 --> 38:14.501
Your father was a man of great wisdom.

38:14.535 --> 38:16.238
He knew, like you now know,

38:16.271 --> 38:18.575
that sometimes the way over a mountain

38:18.608 --> 38:20.176
is through it.

38:20.209 --> 38:22.545
And...

38:22.578 --> 38:24.281
going through the mountain...

38:24.347 --> 38:26.588
well...

38:28.917 --> 38:30.956
that's my specialty.

38:33.388 --> 38:35.723
Be well, Chief Longshadow.

38:39.999 --> 38:41.998
[sighs]

38:42.039 --> 38:46.070
Property report lists the owner of the
warehouse and land as Wildflower, LLC.

38:46.111 --> 38:47.437
<i>Brock: It's probably a shell company.</i>

38:47.478 --> 38:48.772
Proctor's name is nowhere near it.

38:48.805 --> 38:50.644
<i>We'd pretty much have to catch Proctor</i>

38:50.677 --> 38:52.644
<i>in the warehouse personally
cooking up a batch of ecstasy</i>

38:52.677 --> 38:54.181
<i>in order to make the drug charges stick.</i>

38:54.214 --> 38:55.885
Doesn't mean we can't
shut the place down.

38:55.918 --> 38:58.349
Proctor'll have another one
up and running in a week.

38:58.382 --> 39:01.726
You want me to see what I
can find on the shell company?

39:02.655 --> 39:04.897
Uh, yeah. Might as well.

39:04.930 --> 39:06.330
Hey, Emmett...

39:07.436 --> 39:10.065
sorry about what happened yesterday.

39:11.312 --> 39:13.306
You know, the shit at the junkyard.

39:13.343 --> 39:17.138
You know, every time I think
I'm immune to that stuff...

39:17.179 --> 39:19.839
I can only turn the other
cheek for so many times.

39:19.872 --> 39:23.216
But it gave me a chance to be a
good Christian and kick some butt.

39:24.713 --> 39:26.583
And how were you a good Christian?

39:29.255 --> 39:31.184
I forgave them afterwards.

39:55.280 --> 39:56.982
<i>Lucas: Back to square one.</i>

39:57.015 --> 39:59.678
Is there some reason you
need to arrest Proctor today?

40:04.453 --> 40:07.357
<i>Lucas: Proctor does whatever
he wants to whoever he wants.</i>

40:07.390 --> 40:11.061
Every day that list
gets a little bit longer.

40:11.094 --> 40:12.726
Been like that since
before you got here.

40:12.759 --> 40:15.030
That doesn't mean it stays the same way.

40:32.220 --> 40:34.020
- Who's left in the warehouse?
- Nobody.

40:34.053 --> 40:36.325
Do you know whose shit you're stealing?

40:36.358 --> 40:37.860
Who says we're stealing it?

40:37.893 --> 40:40.261
[coughs]

40:40.294 --> 40:44.570
Listen, there's a right way
and a wrong way to get Proctor.

40:45.771 --> 40:47.307
So, you can drive this?

40:47.340 --> 40:48.875
Shit, back in the day,

40:48.908 --> 40:51.882
I used to run a big rig

You sure you want to do this?
