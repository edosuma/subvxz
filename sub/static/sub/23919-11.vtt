00:41.041 --> 00:42.876
Recalculating.

00:42.910 --> 00:46.013
Was it a left back there?

00:46.046 --> 00:48.149
Yeah, I think so.

00:48.182 --> 00:49.850
J-Just follow the GPS,
I'm in a hurry.

00:49.883 --> 00:51.252
Oh, I don't listen to the GPS.

00:51.285 --> 00:52.820
-No way.
-AUTOMATED VOICE: Turn left.

00:52.853 --> 00:54.155
It's always wrong--
is there another way?

00:54.188 --> 00:55.256
Why does it keep
saying "a left"?

00:55.289 --> 00:56.657
AUTOMATED VOICE:
Recalculating.

00:56.690 --> 00:58.659

EARN:
Sorry.

01:24.885 --> 01:26.387
Sit right here.

01:26.420 --> 01:28.556
-Hey, you must be Earn.
-Yes.

01:28.589 --> 01:30.057
Come on in. Have a seat.

01:30.090 --> 01:31.925
-Um... hey.

01:31.959 --> 01:34.228
Sorry I'm late. Um...

01:34.262 --> 01:37.865
My Lyft driver
w-was... religious.

01:37.898 --> 01:39.800
It's fine.
Alfred just got in here.

01:39.833 --> 01:41.235
-You brought a baby.

01:41.269 --> 01:43.604
-Had to.
-LOTTIE: I ain't a baby.

01:43.637 --> 01:45.373
CHRISTIAN: So, gentlemen,
I understand you're looking

01:45.406 --> 01:48.075
-for an entertainment lawyer.
-Yes. Yes, we are.

01:48.108 --> 01:51.078
Well, let me tell you a little
about myself first.

01:51.111 --> 01:53.847
I'm from the D.C. area,
near U Street.

01:53.881 --> 01:57.418
I graduated from Howard
and then went to Georgetown,

01:57.451 --> 02:00.688
but I'm definitely a Hoyas fan.

02:00.721 --> 02:03.957
I graduated the top ten
of my class, and after school,

02:03.991 --> 02:05.959
I went to work at
the Lance and Roberts Law Firm

02:05.993 --> 02:08.128
for almost ten years.

02:08.162 --> 02:09.397
-* Nah-nah nah-nah-nah-nah *

02:09.430 --> 02:11.465
* Nah-nah-nah *

02:11.499 --> 02:14.768
* Nah-nah nah-nah-nah-nah
nah-nah-nah, nah-nah-nah... *

02:14.802 --> 02:18.239
...been here in Atlanta
for the past five years, now.

02:22.976 --> 02:25.145
So who are some of the people
you represent, man?

02:25.179 --> 02:28.115
Well, I represent some singers
and some rappers.

02:28.148 --> 02:29.883
I represent the rapper A.V.

02:29.917 --> 02:31.285
Oh, okay.

02:31.319 --> 02:33.421
-Y-You know that dude.
-Yeah, that dude.

02:33.454 --> 02:35.623
-He had that one song,
"Program." Yeah.
-* Program * Yeah.

02:35.656 --> 02:37.591
CHRISTIAN:
I also represent some actors.

02:37.625 --> 02:41.028
I have four clients on Love &
Hip Hop: Atlanta right now.

02:44.097 --> 02:45.466
LOTTIE:
I don't like lemons.

02:45.499 --> 02:47.468
Yes, I know. You hate lemons.

02:47.501 --> 02:51.305
If he was to go with you,
what would that take?

02:51.339 --> 02:53.507
Well, um, just a few signatures,

02:53.541 --> 02:55.576
and I would receive five percent

02:55.609 --> 02:57.211
of any deal
I looked over for you.

02:57.245 --> 02:58.812
Five percent?

02:58.846 --> 03:00.614
Yes, but that's the standard

03:00.648 --> 03:03.183
that any lawyer would charge.

03:11.659 --> 03:13.827
Look, man. I just don't
want no janky-ass lawyer

03:13.861 --> 03:16.029
putting his hands on my
contracts and checks, a'ight?

03:16.063 --> 03:18.098
I want, like,
a high-level Jewish dude,

03:18.131 --> 03:20.534
not somebody gonna rob me
like Don King or some shit.

03:20.568 --> 03:23.271
Man, Don King wasn't a lawyer,
I'm pretty sure.

03:23.304 --> 03:25.205
Also, Christian came
highly recommended.

03:25.239 --> 03:26.707
He-He supposedly does good work.

03:26.740 --> 03:28.442
Recommended by who, man?

03:28.476 --> 03:30.043
He ain't even got no clients
that make actual money.

03:30.077 --> 03:31.779
All he got is some
F-level rappers

03:31.812 --> 03:33.914
and some reality TV stars.

03:33.947 --> 03:35.916
Reality TV stars, Earn.

03:35.949 --> 03:38.719
Just find me, like,
a big-level firm, man.

03:38.752 --> 03:40.488
Jewish dude.

03:40.521 --> 03:43.324
-All right.
-Yeah.

03:43.357 --> 03:45.793
It's time to start leveling up
on niggas.

03:45.826 --> 03:48.228
I gotta kick off
this European tour.

03:48.262 --> 03:51.131
Shit about to be real different.

03:51.164 --> 03:53.233
Luke really came through
with that one.

03:53.267 --> 03:55.068
-Yeah.

03:55.102 --> 03:56.504
But you should
be headlining that tour.

03:56.537 --> 04:00.541
Yep, I should be...
but I ain't.

04:03.344 --> 04:04.578
ALFRED:
Oh.

04:06.614 --> 04:08.716
All right. I got to...
I got to run some errands

04:08.749 --> 04:10.851
before I meet up at the house,
okay? So, I'll see you there.

04:10.884 --> 04:12.786
-Yeah. The movers
coming by, right?
-Yeah.

04:12.820 --> 04:15.556
You and Darius need to be
packed up. We can't be late.

04:15.589 --> 04:18.392
Yeah, yeah. We know, man.
A'ight, Lottie.

04:18.426 --> 04:21.228
I'll catch up with you, man.

04:26.233 --> 04:27.868
Come on.

04:27.901 --> 04:29.770
-Jewish.
-Yeah.

04:29.803 --> 04:31.672
-Jewish dude, man.
-Yeah, I got you.

04:48.622 --> 04:50.624
(muffled music playing
through headphones)

04:54.528 --> 04:56.129
-Oh.

05:06.674 --> 05:08.776
Here you go.

05:08.809 --> 05:10.778
Two books.

05:14.448 --> 05:16.216
You guys looking for Earn?

05:16.249 --> 05:18.486
Sure is. I'm Kenny.
What's going on?

05:18.519 --> 05:20.688
-Cool. Yeah, yeah.

05:21.989 --> 05:24.525
Is that beer?

05:25.559 --> 05:28.562
No.

05:28.596 --> 05:30.564
Okay.

05:30.598 --> 05:32.433
This way.

05:36.269 --> 05:37.671
All right, guys.

05:37.705 --> 05:39.139
These are the movers.

05:39.172 --> 05:40.974
Uh, um, the bedrooms
are in the back. Okay?

05:41.008 --> 05:42.810
Just hurry up.
We got a plane to catch.

05:42.843 --> 05:44.445
-Okay.
-Please.

05:44.478 --> 05:46.780
-All right, little girl.

05:46.814 --> 05:48.649
Here you go.

05:48.682 --> 05:50.651
You guys packed?

05:50.684 --> 05:53.186
Yeah, bet you think you slick.

05:55.022 --> 05:56.189
What're you talking about?

06:01.995 --> 06:03.363
ALFRED:
Yeah.

06:03.397 --> 06:05.165
-I don't want that thing, man.

06:05.198 --> 06:07.468
-See, you're gonna jam me up.
-Okay, I'm sorry.

06:07.501 --> 06:09.136
All right?
I'll-I'll-I'll get rid of it.

06:09.169 --> 06:11.004
Just throw it in the ocean, bro.

06:12.372 --> 06:14.041
You guys got your passports?

06:14.074 --> 06:16.009
Yeah, but, uh,
Darius gonna need some help.

06:16.043 --> 06:18.211
Oh, yeah, I think mine is, uh,

06:18.245 --> 06:20.481
like, ex-expired or something.

06:20.514 --> 06:22.382
What?

06:22.416 --> 06:24.785
I don't know. It could be just
the date's a little late.

06:24.818 --> 06:26.687
I don't know. Maybe.

06:26.720 --> 06:30.724
Whenever you got guys that don't
know what they're doing.

06:30.758 --> 06:34.695
My nigga,
this is definitely expired.

06:34.728 --> 06:36.564
Don't worry, my friend.

06:36.597 --> 06:40.167
I know a place we can go, get
a renewal same day. It's okay.

06:40.200 --> 06:43.904
Well, we got to do that,
like, today. Right now.

06:43.937 --> 06:46.474
Okay.
: Okay.

06:46.507 --> 06:48.542
It's not that big of a deal.

06:48.576 --> 06:51.812
We'll go.

06:51.845 --> 06:54.214
You think you're slick?

06:56.584 --> 06:58.586
LOTTIE:
They have a penguin.

06:58.619 --> 07:01.088
Monster hat.

07:02.756 --> 07:04.725
All right. Uh, I got to go.

07:04.758 --> 07:07.595
When I get back, we're going
to this passport place.

07:07.628 --> 07:09.730
I'm gonna make sure
that happens, okay?

07:09.763 --> 07:12.533
And Al? Could you, um,
just stay on these guys?

07:12.566 --> 07:14.434
Okay, we got an international
flight, which means we got

07:14.468 --> 07:16.169
to be there early,
and I know you sell weed,

07:16.203 --> 07:17.505
-so you don't care about time...
-True.

07:17.538 --> 07:19.039
...but it's important,
all right?

07:19.072 --> 07:22.275
All right. I'll catch
you guys later. Lottie!

07:22.309 --> 07:24.578
Why did he give me
your passport?

07:24.612 --> 07:26.079
Huh. All right, it's your turn.

07:26.113 --> 07:27.581
Almost there.

07:27.615 --> 07:30.350
Here we go.
All right.

07:30.383 --> 07:33.386
Now we got to...
find the... room.

07:33.420 --> 07:34.855
-No.

07:34.888 --> 07:38.125
Huh?

07:38.158 --> 07:40.460
Okay. Yeah.
Here we...

07:40.494 --> 07:42.596
There we go.

07:42.630 --> 07:45.165
(woman humming to the tune of
"Wheels on the Bus")

07:51.805 --> 07:54.675
I'm sorry. Did we come
at a wrong time?

07:54.708 --> 07:57.377
Oh. No. No, no, no,
not at all.

07:57.410 --> 07:59.379
How are you, Vanessa?

07:59.412 --> 08:01.181
-Nice to see you again.
-Mm-hmm.

08:01.214 --> 08:02.816
And you must be Lottie's father.

08:02.850 --> 08:04.117
-Hi.

08:04.151 --> 08:06.453
So nice to finally meet you.

08:06.486 --> 08:08.155
This is just a conference
I wanted to have

08:08.188 --> 08:11.158
to talk to the both
of you about Lottie.

08:11.191 --> 08:13.193
Is everything all right?

08:13.226 --> 08:17.798
Um... she seems to be...

08:17.831 --> 08:21.535
very... advanced.

08:21.569 --> 08:23.937
Very gifted.

08:23.971 --> 08:26.439
-Oh, my God. Thank God.

08:26.473 --> 08:28.175
I thought
she was pulling her hair out

08:28.208 --> 08:31.478
-and eating it or something.
-Oh. Nothing of the sort.

08:31.511 --> 08:33.313
Or like sniffing Wite-Out

08:33.346 --> 08:34.748
-or something bad.
-Oh, no, no, no.

08:34.782 --> 08:35.983
-Biting children.
-Yeah.

08:36.016 --> 08:37.785
Far from it. Far from it.

08:37.818 --> 08:40.821
She is excelling in everything.
I mean,

08:40.854 --> 08:43.190
she knows all her colors,
she knows her letters.

08:43.223 --> 08:45.425
She's beginning to work
math problems.

08:45.458 --> 08:47.795
-Mmm.
-That's why I spoke

08:47.828 --> 08:49.763
with my friend
at the Holy Oak Academy.

08:49.797 --> 08:52.833
It's one of the best schools
in the Southeast.

08:52.866 --> 08:54.968
They have space available

08:55.002 --> 08:57.504
for their pre-K program
next year,

08:57.537 --> 08:59.372
and I think it might be
a good idea

08:59.406 --> 09:01.842
for the two of you to consider
enrolling Lottie there.

09:01.875 --> 09:03.510
EARN:
Okay.

09:03.543 --> 09:05.278
-Private school, yeah.

09:05.312 --> 09:08.215
It's a private school.
It has a reasonable tuition.

09:08.248 --> 09:10.651
-Okay. Okay.
-Mmm.

09:10.684 --> 09:12.686
Okay, we'll-we'll definitely
do that.

09:12.720 --> 09:16.523
That-That-That sounds like
something we'd-we'd probably do,

09:16.556 --> 09:19.192
-uh, for first grade.
-Get the money together.

09:19.226 --> 09:21.829
Yeah. Is there anything
we can do with her staying here,

09:21.862 --> 09:24.264
to
Like, maybe, um,

09:24.297 --> 09:26.233
some more books or assignments?

09:26.266 --> 09:28.201
Stay here? No.

09:28.235 --> 09:30.270
This school is awful.

09:33.607 --> 09:36.109
-Yes.

09:36.143 --> 09:38.646
There are not enough resources
or faculty

09:38.679 --> 09:40.380
to engage a student like Lottie.

09:40.413 --> 09:44.451
She is really stunting
her education here.

09:47.454 --> 09:51.424
Is there something
we could do for Lottie

09:51.458 --> 09:53.661
that, um...

09:53.694 --> 09:55.696
would be...

09:58.766 --> 10:00.968
...cheaper?

10:03.937 --> 10:06.774
Keep her in a happy,
two

10:08.041 --> 10:10.243
-Huh.
-Hmm.

10:10.277 --> 10:12.245
-Interesting.
-Good.

10:12.279 --> 10:15.115
-Thank you.
-Yeah. It was nice

10:15.148 --> 10:16.950
-seeing you again, Ms. Granger.
-Nice to see you, too.

10:16.984 --> 10:18.919
Thank you.

10:18.952 --> 10:22.690
-VAN: Lottie.

10:22.723 --> 10:25.225
-EARN: Uh, we...
we're gonna go home.
-We're gonna go home.

10:25.258 --> 10:28.862
-Bye!
-Bye!

10:30.163 --> 10:31.398
I'm sorry.

10:31.431 --> 10:33.566
Um...

10:33.600 --> 10:35.135
would you have told us
that this school was bad

10:35.168 --> 10:37.604
if she really was
a regular student?

10:37.637 --> 10:39.606
No.

10:39.639 --> 10:42.275
If I see a steer smart enough
to get out of the pen,

10:42.309 --> 10:44.912
I leave the gate open.

10:44.945 --> 10:47.280
Thank you for coming in.

10:48.716 --> 10:51.284
Thank you.

10:54.788 --> 10:55.789
VAN:
So, she just compared the school

10:55.823 --> 10:57.257
to a slaughterhouse, right?

10:57.290 --> 10:58.591
EARN: Yeah, she definitely did.
I heard that.

10:58.625 --> 11:00.761
VAN:
Okay.

11:00.794 --> 11:03.096
I mean, she's crazy.

11:03.130 --> 11:06.333
Schools in this area
aren't that great. We knew that.

11:06.366 --> 11:08.969
-Lottie, come here.
-Yeah.

11:11.038 --> 11:13.774
-But at least here,
she won't be the only black kid.

11:13.807 --> 11:16.543
I interviewed at Holy Oak's.

11:16.576 --> 11:19.913
It is pretty white, but that's
all these private schools.

11:19.947 --> 11:22.482
-You know that.
You chose Princeton.

11:23.516 --> 11:25.652
Yeah.

11:25.685 --> 11:27.054
LOTTIE:
Mm.

11:28.956 --> 11:31.158
You leaving for,
like, two months?

11:31.191 --> 11:34.527
Yeah, but, you know, that...

11:34.561 --> 11:36.629
that should be tuition
for her now.

11:36.663 --> 11:38.866
LOTTIE:
Mm.

11:38.899 --> 11:42.202
If she goes to this school,
she's gonna need you to show up.

11:42.235 --> 11:43.703
More than you've been able to.

11:45.405 --> 11:47.274
-Yeah, I know. We'll...

11:47.307 --> 11:49.843
we'll make it work.

11:51.344 --> 11:53.146
Get in the car, baby.

11:53.180 --> 11:55.182
I was...

11:55.215 --> 11:58.618
-Under the bridge.

11:58.651 --> 12:01.021
-Let me help.

12:01.054 --> 12:02.522
Oh, watch your head.

12:02.555 --> 12:03.824
Oh, it's a big one.

12:06.093 --> 12:10.330
-You know, I always thought
she was gonna be smart.
-LOTTIE: That's it.

12:10.363 --> 12:14.234
I think
every parent thinks that.

12:14.267 --> 12:17.004
I don't know. I mean...

12:17.037 --> 12:20.640
I thought she was, like,
gonna actually be advanced.

12:26.713 --> 12:29.049
You're smart.

12:29.082 --> 12:31.384
I figured...

12:31.418 --> 12:33.053
some of it
would get passed along,

12:33.086 --> 12:35.055
hopefully.

12:35.088 --> 12:38.826
Yeah, well,
you're smart, too, so...

12:38.859 --> 12:40.961
maybe it was yours, you know?

12:44.064 --> 12:46.233
Thanks.

12:46.266 --> 12:48.568
All right, I got to...
I got to get going.

12:48.601 --> 12:50.838
I got to make sure
Darius gets his passport

12:50.871 --> 12:53.073
-and got to catch this flight.
-Okay.

12:53.106 --> 12:55.142
Be good.

12:55.175 --> 12:57.010
All right?

12:57.044 --> 12:59.546
Be good for Mama. I love you.

13:06.453 --> 13:08.355

13:23.937 --> 13:26.539
Oh, yeah. Um...

Yeah, I'm fine.

13:28.575 --> 13:30.844

-Whoo-wee!

14:40.380 --> 14:42.115
Y'all went to lunch?

14:42.149 --> 14:43.450
We get a lunch break.

14:43.483 --> 14:45.185
It's 3:00 p.m.

14:45.218 --> 14:47.387
Yeah. I didn't eat

14:47.420 --> 14:50.390
Oh, yeah. Darius is packed!
I'm ready to go.

14:50.423 --> 14:52.892
Great. Just-just put
your luggage in the car, man.

14:52.926 --> 14:56.329
Oh. No, I meant
I'm packed to move,

14:56.363 --> 14:58.165
not for the airport.

14:58.198 --> 15:01.201
Nigga, it's fine. We'll
just come back here afterwards.

15:01.234 --> 15:04.537
Kenny, I really need you
to pack up everything, man.

Damn. You bruisin' that boy.

My crew's hungry.

All right. I'll meet you

15:28.661 --> 15:30.230
I got your passport.
Bring your keys.

15:30.263 --> 15:32.565
Okay. Oh.

15:32.599 --> 15:36.636

from pocket...
-We need to go!

15:57.857 --> 15:59.892

16:04.297 --> 16:06.533
When you piss, do you go
straight through the zipper

16:06.566 --> 16:08.968
or do you go over the boxers?

16:10.303 --> 16:11.771
Over the boxers.

16:11.804 --> 16:14.607
Yeah. Me, too.

16:14.641 --> 16:17.944
But is that the right way,
though?

16:17.977 --> 16:19.379
I don't think so.

16:19.412 --> 16:21.381
Bro, you could...

16:21.414 --> 16:23.116
Yeah.

16:23.150 --> 16:26.086
But, I mean, I do switch it up
when I'm wearing a suit.

16:26.119 --> 16:28.388
You know?

16:30.990 --> 16:33.793
EARN: I didn't even know
this neighborhood existed.

16:33.826 --> 16:36.629
DARIUS:
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

16:42.001 --> 16:44.137
Hey. How can I help you guys?

16:44.171 --> 16:46.806
Yeah, we need
a passport replacement.

16:46.839 --> 16:48.475

Okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Um,

All right. Thank you.
I love you.

16:56.683 --> 16:59.486
Thanks.

16:59.519 --> 17:02.822
Really? 'Cause I-I really
thought we were gonna be S.O.L.

17:02.855 --> 17:05.725
Yeah. It's what we do here.

Y'all in a rap entourage?

17:09.529 --> 17:10.730
Manager?

17:10.763 --> 17:13.400
How'd you know?

17:13.433 --> 17:15.235
We kind of have a...

17:15.268 --> 17:17.537
specific clientele here. And...

17:17.570 --> 17:19.139
rappers are procrastinators.

17:19.172 --> 17:20.673
No offense.

17:20.707 --> 17:21.908
None taken.

17:21.941 --> 17:25.145
So, who y'all work with?

17:25.178 --> 17:26.979
Uh, Paper Boi.

17:27.013 --> 17:28.881
We're going on tour
with Clark County in Europe.

17:28.915 --> 17:30.817
Oh, man, that's cool. Nice.

17:30.850 --> 17:34.020
I was just listening

an entertainment lawyer?

17:40.160 --> 17:41.761
My cousin is primo.

17:41.794 --> 17:44.431
Uh, I need ID.

17:44.464 --> 17:46.766
Oh. Yeah.

17:46.799 --> 17:49.369
How'd your cousin
get into the business?

17:49.402 --> 17:52.038
Uh, my uncle does it.

17:52.071 --> 17:54.407
Thanks, man.

17:56.042 --> 17:57.910
Let me ask you something.

17:57.944 --> 18:00.280
And, um,

18:00.313 --> 18:02.782
be honest.

18:02.815 --> 18:04.551
Do you think
there's a black lawyer

18:04.584 --> 18:06.386
who's as good as your cousin?

18:14.961 --> 18:16.929
There definitely is.

18:16.963 --> 18:20.700
But, um, part of being good at
your job are your connections,

18:20.733 --> 18:22.935
and black people
just don't have the connections

18:22.969 --> 18:25.338
that my cousin has.

18:25.372 --> 18:29.342
For systemic reasons.

18:29.376 --> 18:30.743
All right.

18:30.777 --> 18:31.978
It's all good.

18:32.011 --> 18:33.413
Oh, perfect.

18:33.446 --> 18:35.248
Yeah, it should be,
like, uh, two hours.

18:35.282 --> 18:36.583
-Oh.
-Cool.

18:36.616 --> 18:37.850
-That's fast.
-Yeah, yeah.

18:37.884 --> 18:40.387
It's, uh, $350.

18:40.420 --> 18:42.789
Oh, that's why. Okay.

18:42.822 --> 18:44.457
Y'all take RushCards?

Yeah, I think so.

Is Al gonna fire me?

19:22.662 --> 19:24.631
I don't know.

19:24.664 --> 19:27.066
Maybe.

19:30.069 --> 19:32.639
I know you're always at peace
with everything,

19:32.672 --> 19:36.042
but my whole world's
falling apart.

19:36.075 --> 19:38.411
So...

Look, man,

to take care of the ones

20:02.269 --> 20:04.837
he's supposed to provide for,
including you.

20:04.871 --> 20:06.239
I don't want a handout.

20:06.273 --> 20:08.007
I got to provide, too.

I see you, man.
I see you... learning.

20:14.981 --> 20:18.851
But...
learning requires failure.

20:18.885 --> 20:22.255
Al just trying to make sure
you ain't failing in...

20:22.289 --> 20:24.957
in his life.

20:24.991 --> 20:28.160
You know, like,
y'all both black, so...

20:28.194 --> 20:31.163
I mean, y'all both
can't afford to fail.

20:34.133 --> 20:36.503
Do Nigerians get a chance
to fail?

20:36.536 --> 20:37.970
Hey, don't you start that.

20:38.004 --> 20:39.872
You know Nigerians don't fail.

20:45.812 --> 20:47.980
Look, whatever he does,

20:48.014 --> 20:50.550
he ain't gonna do it
till we get to Europe.

20:50.583 --> 20:53.320
Give you a chance
to see the world.

20:53.353 --> 20:55.688

21:46.639 --> 21:49.075
Let's talk when we land, man.

"Y'all ain't gonna make it,"
five times

23:19.566 --> 23:22.702

23:36.749 --> 23:38.718
Man, we gonna be poppin' bottles
in Paris, bro.

23:38.751 --> 23:40.152
-It's gonna be crazy. Yeah.
-It's lit, bro.

23:40.186 --> 23:41.488
Speaking sign language to hoes.

23:41.521 --> 23:43.255
-It's gonna be dope, man.

23:43.289 --> 23:44.757
-I'm good, man.
-You check out that lawyer
I sent you?

23:44.791 --> 23:46.192
Hell, yeah, man.
He's perfect. I appreciate it.

23:47.860 --> 23:50.296
Hey, okay, cool.
Let's-let's do this over here.

23:50.329 --> 23:52.732
Flight's not gonna leave
without Clark County, baby.

23:52.765 --> 23:55.768
-Yeah.

23:55.802 --> 23:57.570
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

23:57.604 --> 24:00.272
-WOMAN: Please take liquids

24:00.306 --> 24:02.374
-out of your bags...

24:02.408 --> 24:04.043
...and laptops, too.

24:04.076 --> 24:06.278
Place everything in the bins.

24:06.312 --> 24:09.315
-Your pockets should be empty.
-WOMAN 2: Remove your jackets.

24:09.348 --> 24:11.684
:
Opt out!

24:11.718 --> 24:14.053
-MAN: Oh.

24:14.086 --> 24:16.689
You always got to opt out.
Opt for the pat-down, man.

24:16.723 --> 24:19.425
I'm telling you, this-this thing
here-- bad business.

24:21.127 --> 24:23.062
That's why security stays
so close to the food.

24:23.095 --> 24:26.966
They don't want you to smell
your brain frying in this thing.

24:29.502 --> 24:33.506
-WOMAN: Excuse me. Sorry.

24:33.540 --> 24:36.208
WOMAN 2:
Everything in the bins, people.

24:38.444 --> 24:40.813
(sound ceases
except for quiet beeping)

24:54.961 --> 24:56.529
(sound resumes,
indistinct chatter)

24:56.563 --> 24:58.430
Will you hand me a bin?

24:58.464 --> 25:00.099
You got to get it
from the front, man.

25:00.132 --> 25:02.201
Oh, man, he asked nicely.

25:02.234 --> 25:05.337
-Thanks.

25:05.371 --> 25:07.974
(indistinct,
overlapping crowd chatter)

25:08.007 --> 25:09.776
-ALFRED: You know what
I don't get?

25:09.809 --> 25:12.111
How they make you take all your
shit off, and they try to rush

25:12.144 --> 25:13.946
to get you out of the way,
like they ain't just asked me

25:13.980 --> 25:15.782
-to take all your shit off
ten seconds ago.

25:15.815 --> 25:17.049
ALFRED: That's why I fuckin'
hate the airport, man.

25:17.083 --> 25:18.651
DARIUS:
Yeah, it's not efficient.

25:18.685 --> 25:20.086
-ALFRED: All that shit isn't.
-We should hurry.

25:20.119 --> 25:21.854
-All right.

25:21.888 --> 25:23.355
Hey, what
What's going on?

25:23.389 --> 25:24.757
WOMAN:
We're going this way.

25:24.791 --> 25:25.992
We're starting another line
this way.

25:26.025 --> 25:27.660
CLARK:
Hey, yo, Luke, come here.

25:39.872 --> 25:42.541
Man, this trip
gonna be crazy, boy.

25:42.575 --> 25:47.714
I mean, I ain't never really
left Georgia before, so, yeah.

25:47.747 --> 25:49.849
Yeah.

25:49.882 --> 25:51.984
Yeah, it's gonna be cool.

25:54.453 --> 25:56.689
Yeah, it'll be cool.

25:56.723 --> 25:59.125
-Shit.

25:59.158 --> 26:01.160
Yeah.

26:04.897 --> 26:06.899

26:06.933 --> 26:09.268
WOMAN: Okay, I'm just gonna
move this over here

26:09.301 --> 26:11.704
to make a little more room.

26:11.738 --> 26:14.006
I saw what you did...

26:14.040 --> 26:17.043
-at TSA.
-Mm.

26:17.076 --> 26:19.511
You ain't got to say shit.

26:23.149 --> 26:26.919
Just know that's exactly
what I'm talking about.

26:30.189 --> 26:33.125
Niggas do not care about us,
man.

26:34.694 --> 26:37.096
Niggas gonna do whatever
they got to do to survive,

26:37.129 --> 26:39.231
'cause they ain't got no choice.

26:40.667 --> 26:43.035
We ain't got no choice, either.

26:47.539 --> 26:49.508
You my family, Earn.

26:51.077 --> 26:54.146
Yeah, you...

26:54.180 --> 26:57.316
You're the only one
that knows what I'm about.

26:59.652 --> 27:02.054
You give a fuck.

27:03.522 --> 27:05.658
I need that.

27:07.960 --> 27:10.362
All right?

27:18.337 --> 27:20.439
All right, then.

27:20.472 --> 27:22.574
Hey?

27:22.608 --> 27:24.476
Let's get this money.

27:25.978 --> 27:27.346
BOTH:
Brrr!

27:27.379 --> 27:28.781
-Hey, shit.
-Yeah, boy.

27:33.085 --> 27:35.521
ALFRED:
Hey, Clark, man?

27:37.023 --> 27:39.291
Let me holler at you.

27:39.325 --> 27:41.193
Yeah. What's up, man?

27:41.227 --> 27:42.962
Where Luke at, man?

27:42.995 --> 27:44.897
Uh, nah, man.

27:44.931 --> 27:47.099
Luke got in some shit.
Cops took him.

27:47.133 --> 27:49.769
ALFRED:
What you talking about?

27:49.802 --> 27:53.105
TSA found a tool in his bag.

27:53.139 --> 27:54.640
Damn.

27:54.673 --> 27:56.242
-Oh.
-It's just kind of...

27:56.275 --> 27:57.643
Oh, he probably had
a screwdriver or something.

27:57.676 --> 27:58.978
You can't have those on a plane.

27:59.011 --> 28:01.547
Yeah. More like a hammer.

28:01.580 --> 28:03.015
Yeah. It was gold, too.

28:04.751 --> 28:06.285
Shit was clean, though.

28:06.318 --> 28:07.987
Wish it was mine.

28:08.020 --> 28:10.689
* Yoohoo! *

28:18.364 --> 28:20.800
The piece was in Clark's bag.

28:39.251 --> 28:41.220
-TRACY: Yo, Alf!

Yo, open the door, man!

28:47.459 --> 28:50.129
Open up, man!

28:50.162 --> 28:53.900
Listen, man, I got Chinese food
with a side of chocolate.

28:53.933 --> 28:56.668

28:56.702 --> 29:00.139

29:10.049 --> 29:12.251

29:20.092 --> 29:21.693

29:21.727 --> 29:27.766

29:31.103 --> 29:33.405
* From the west down *

29:33.439 --> 29:38.978
* To the east... *

29:39.011 --> 29:43.782
* Any day, now *

29:43.816 --> 29:48.320
* Any day,
now *

29:48.354 --> 29:54.126
* I shall be released *

29:58.931 --> 30:02.134
* They say every man needs
protection *

30:06.472 --> 30:10.843
* They say
every man must fall. *
