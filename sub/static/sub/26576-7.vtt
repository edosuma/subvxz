WEBVTT

00:05.122 --> 00:06.382
Wow.

00:06.680 --> 00:08.250
Big Adele fan, huh?

00:08.275 --> 00:10.703
No, just a fan of a free T-shirt.

00:10.945 --> 00:13.051
Look, I'm here to update
you on the construction.

00:13.120 --> 00:15.319
I, uh, I have a new date of completion.

00:15.344 --> 00:19.030
Vlad, Vlad, Vlad, this ain't
my first rodeo, all right?

00:19.055 --> 00:20.755
We agreed on eight weeks.

00:20.780 --> 00:22.766
So before you go trying
to pad the schedule

00:22.791 --> 00:26.531
with some story about a
fire at the sconce factory,

00:26.629 --> 00:28.069
this job will be done...

00:28.094 --> 00:29.805
- In one week.
- What?

00:29.830 --> 00:31.234
We're a little early, so feel free

00:31.259 --> 00:32.868
to use it on your Yelp review.

00:33.441 --> 00:34.911
That's a lot early.

00:35.277 --> 00:38.045
I mean, that is good news, yes?

00:38.356 --> 00:39.855
Now you can sell the house.

00:39.949 --> 00:42.850
Yeah, right, of course. We're
absolutely gonna do that.

00:44.754 --> 00:46.492
Right after we redo the garage.

00:46.517 --> 00:47.217
What?

00:47.242 --> 00:48.444
You're finished so early,

00:48.469 --> 00:51.428
let's put in a new
kitchen, update the bath.

00:51.738 --> 00:52.889
How long will that take?

00:52.914 --> 00:54.561
We already have a lot of work lined up.

00:54.586 --> 00:56.055
I mean, I can try to squeeze in...

00:56.080 --> 00:57.078
Squeeze in.

00:57.122 --> 00:59.022
- It will not be quick.
- Who said quick?

00:59.124 --> 01:00.724
Take your time.

01:00.826 --> 01:02.814
Treat me like a lady.

01:02.944 --> 01:05.172
Incidentally, we're
gonna need to pay you

01:05.197 --> 01:07.382
in tiny, lady-like installments.

01:09.000 --> 01:15.074

01:29.541 --> 01:30.907
Hey, neighbor. Hey.

01:31.022 --> 01:33.003
I made you something.

01:35.230 --> 01:36.639
Breakfast buns?

01:36.664 --> 01:38.664
These are them? You made these for me?

01:38.689 --> 01:40.142
Well, I made 'em for the kids,

01:40.167 --> 01:42.560
but I had couple dozen left over, so...

01:42.585 --> 01:44.703
Mmm.

01:44.728 --> 01:47.515
I also wanted to talk with you
about remodeling the garage.

01:47.540 --> 01:49.209
So good. I was thinking

01:49.234 --> 01:51.952
maybe we bring this
whole place up to code.

01:51.977 --> 01:53.322
Why?

01:53.705 --> 01:55.238
Why are they so good? Huh?

01:55.263 --> 01:57.897
I mean, did you put extra
cinnamon o-or, like, vanilla?

01:57.922 --> 01:59.719
Maybe put in a small kitchen?

01:59.744 --> 02:02.345
Smart. Yeah, it'll be great for
the resale value when we sell.

02:02.393 --> 02:03.583
If we sell.

02:03.640 --> 02:05.467
- When we sell.
- If or when we sell.

02:05.492 --> 02:08.663
Just ask Vlad just not to start
work in here right away.

02:08.689 --> 02:09.808
I have plans tomorrow night.

02:09.833 --> 02:10.728
Oh, no problem.

02:10.752 --> 02:11.966
Thank you.

02:13.683 --> 02:14.815
What the hell?

02:14.964 --> 02:17.040
Oh, yeah, no, it's, uh,
it's citrus-tinged...

02:17.065 --> 02:17.877
- Uh, yeah.
- With, uh...

02:17.902 --> 02:18.478
With..-

02:18.845 --> 02:21.664
- hints of sun-dried huckleberry.
- Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

02:21.697 --> 02:22.853
Now, would you say that scent

02:22.878 --> 02:25.480
is overpowering or welcoming?

02:26.230 --> 02:27.197
- Welcoming?
- Mm.

02:27.222 --> 02:28.299
- I guess?
- Good. Good, good, good.

02:28.324 --> 02:29.942
And would you say the throw pillows

02:29.967 --> 02:34.670
are carefully arranged
or casually tossed?

02:37.167 --> 02:39.286
'Cause I'm going with casually tossed.

02:39.553 --> 02:41.686
Do you have a garage date?

02:41.945 --> 02:45.023
Well, we may not limit it to the garage,

02:45.048 --> 02:47.759
but, uh, yeah.

02:47.784 --> 02:49.317
Yeah. First date.

02:49.371 --> 02:51.371
You know, you don't wanna
just keep her in the garage.

02:51.473 --> 02:53.425
Get her out there, see some things.

02:53.761 --> 02:55.093
It's not a first date.

02:55.118 --> 02:56.717
Of course not. Why would it be?

02:56.882 --> 02:59.555
Just awesome, crazy, sexy, cool.

02:59.685 --> 03:02.013
So, where did you meet
this little chickadee,

03:02.038 --> 03:04.755
this boneless, skinless lil' nugget?

03:04.780 --> 03:06.839
Um, well, uh, she works in my building,

03:06.864 --> 03:09.917
and she has bones and skin.

03:09.976 --> 03:11.193
Jackpot.

03:11.218 --> 03:12.346
I'm sorry.

03:12.371 --> 03:13.689
Is this making you feel weird?

03:13.714 --> 03:15.648
I-I'm actually feeling weird.

03:15.673 --> 03:17.307
- What?! Why?
- I just...

03:17.332 --> 03:18.564
It's not weird at all.

03:18.666 --> 03:20.032
Not a'tall.

03:20.134 --> 03:21.776
I am super psyched for you guys,

03:21.803 --> 03:23.536
and I hope you have so much fun

03:23.638 --> 03:27.784
on your date with the
casually-tossed pillows.

03:33.615 --> 03:35.442
Doesn't he have someplace to go?

03:35.467 --> 03:38.094
If he did, wouldn't he
be there right now?

03:38.818 --> 03:42.464
I mean, what do children do all day?

03:43.005 --> 03:44.471
Sell magazines?

03:44.789 --> 03:46.455
He's obviously exhausted.

03:46.480 --> 03:47.395
- Yeah.
- Right?

03:47.420 --> 03:49.654
I'm sure he'll wake up
when it's time to feed.

03:49.922 --> 03:51.358
For now,

03:51.682 --> 03:55.739
I'm just gonna leave him with
these frozen mozzarella sticks,

03:55.764 --> 03:58.972
house key, some pocket cash,

03:58.997 --> 04:01.201
and a sticky note expressing our love.

04:01.226 --> 04:02.869
Mwah.

04:04.043 --> 04:06.036
Okay, does he really need $100?

04:06.061 --> 04:07.426
Yes, he does.

04:07.799 --> 04:09.692
Love you, Auntie.

04:10.926 --> 04:13.462
It's a joy I've never known.

04:13.783 --> 04:15.006
Do you love me?

04:15.215 --> 04:19.666
Am I thrilled that he's got some
rando garage gal staying over?

04:19.692 --> 04:21.589
Okay, how is she the garage gal?

04:21.615 --> 04:23.448
You're the one who lives in there.

04:23.473 --> 04:25.440
Seriously, could you imagine
if some guy was like,

04:25.465 --> 04:27.535
"Hey, come on over to my garage.

04:27.801 --> 04:30.868
Do you... Uh, did you want to
watch some TV in my garage?

04:30.937 --> 04:33.488
Can I get you a drink from the
mini-fridge in my garage?"

04:33.513 --> 04:35.082
That's your mini-fridge.

04:35.107 --> 04:36.373
You bought it.

04:36.398 --> 04:37.397
Well.

04:37.518 --> 04:39.269
I'm certainly not gonna rock the boat.

04:39.294 --> 04:40.993
Martin's already got
one foot out the door.

04:41.087 --> 04:43.154
You know who doesn't have
one foot out the door?

04:43.256 --> 04:44.801
My little nephew.

04:45.121 --> 04:48.434
Sleeping in his little footsie pajamas,

04:48.459 --> 04:49.892
with his little fuzz-stache,

04:49.917 --> 04:51.504
holding onto his big, ol'
bottle of grape soda

04:51.529 --> 04:53.895
he falls asleep with every night.

04:54.094 --> 04:55.922
You know, he just lost a tooth.

04:56.105 --> 04:58.294
Camille, that's not good.

04:58.319 --> 05:00.802
I don't judge your
parenting, "garage girl."

05:01.082 --> 05:03.926
I honestly don't know what his
mother is so upset about.

05:03.951 --> 05:05.902
The kid's an absolute angel.

05:05.927 --> 05:07.685
Well, that's probably
because you don't ask him

05:07.710 --> 05:08.967
to do anything

05:08.992 --> 05:12.063
like brush his teeth or take a shower.

05:12.398 --> 05:13.815
How's he doing in school?

05:15.058 --> 05:16.401
Camille?

05:17.827 --> 05:19.727
Gun-Woo goes to school, right?

05:19.829 --> 05:21.506
I assume so. I don't know for sure.

05:21.531 --> 05:22.596
I'm not his jailer.

05:22.698 --> 05:24.183
Oh, my God. That's a no.

05:24.208 --> 05:26.141
He's here on vacation.

05:26.356 --> 05:28.026
Plus it was just Thanksgiving,

05:28.051 --> 05:32.303
so aren't schools shut down
until after... Sundance?

05:32.328 --> 05:33.981
My understanding was that the two of you

05:34.006 --> 05:36.245
were supposed to be helping
him get his act together.

05:36.270 --> 05:37.200
By doing what?

05:37.225 --> 05:39.134
By sticking him in another institution

05:39.159 --> 05:40.816
that he's just gonna fail out of

05:40.841 --> 05:43.300
because they don't get him nor he them?

05:43.325 --> 05:44.657
Well, what about home-school?

05:44.682 --> 05:46.237
I... I've been doing some research,

05:46.262 --> 05:48.676
and I think I might
actually do that myself.

05:49.124 --> 05:51.324
I think I might actually do that myself.

05:51.367 --> 05:53.313
But you're not really an educator.

05:53.701 --> 05:55.101
Aren't I?

05:55.271 --> 05:56.659
- I mean, no.
- No.

05:56.684 --> 05:58.644
Look, I think that we can all agree

05:58.669 --> 06:02.098
that with smartphones and
iPhones and Androids,

06:02.369 --> 06:04.439
AT&T, Sprint, and Verizon...

06:04.464 --> 06:06.363
She's just naming phone carriers.

06:06.388 --> 06:07.938
Knowledge is obsolete.

06:07.963 --> 06:10.130
Everyone just Googles everything anyway.

06:10.155 --> 06:11.942
But do you know what you can't Google?

06:12.215 --> 06:15.684
Good taste, a discriminating palate.

06:15.752 --> 06:18.712
And those are the things
that I can teach him.

06:20.821 --> 06:22.180
Well, I'm sold.

06:24.739 --> 06:25.871
Hey, Vlad?

06:25.896 --> 06:28.277
Martin wants us to hold
the work on the garage.

06:28.343 --> 06:30.642
Apparently he and his
girlfriend have plans.

06:30.667 --> 06:33.106
I mean, girlfriend is
a little premature,

06:33.131 --> 06:34.223
but she is staying over.

06:34.248 --> 06:36.281
Which is great and not at all weird.

06:36.306 --> 06:37.512
- I made some crudités for him
- Yes, we can do that, sir.

06:37.537 --> 06:38.763
- To put out...
- I understand.

06:38.788 --> 06:40.822
Oh, on the phone. You are on the phone.

06:40.847 --> 06:43.175
That's why I sent you
the samples, yes. Uh...

06:43.200 --> 06:44.166
I'm... I'm still talking.

06:44.191 --> 06:45.735
I thought you might react this way.

06:45.760 --> 06:47.214
We can try it again, yes.

06:47.239 --> 06:48.825
Hopefully fourth time's the charm.

06:48.850 --> 06:50.277
You have a good one, too.

06:50.302 --> 06:53.119
Mm-hmm. Bad day?

06:53.144 --> 06:55.065
I actually think I found a client

06:55.090 --> 06:56.300
that's more difficult than you.

06:56.325 --> 06:57.591
I'm particular.

06:57.660 --> 06:59.230
I think that's a bit more fair.

06:59.255 --> 07:01.825
And just like you, he
is very, very annoying.

07:01.979 --> 07:04.135
But at least you know
exactly what you want.

07:04.160 --> 07:05.359
This guy has no idea.

07:05.461 --> 07:08.331
Have you tried asking him
what sort of lifestyle

07:08.356 --> 07:09.832
he aspires to, you know,

07:09.857 --> 07:12.224
and then work those elements
into a concrete design?

07:12.249 --> 07:13.200
What do you mean?

07:13.225 --> 07:14.957
Let's say he wants to feel like

07:14.982 --> 07:17.918
a fancy Moroccan hotelier.

07:18.066 --> 07:20.333
You suggest a sunken living
room with a fire element.

07:20.358 --> 07:22.411
Woven rugs, hanging lanterns,
decorative tile...

07:22.436 --> 07:24.770
You speak high-maintenance crazy person.

07:24.795 --> 07:26.059
- Well...
- You are bilingual.

07:26.084 --> 07:28.832
Come speak to my mentally
unstable client,

07:28.857 --> 07:29.953
translate for me.

07:29.978 --> 07:32.036
Uh, I'm very flattered, but...

07:39.882 --> 07:42.231
Actually, I'd love to
get out of the house.

07:42.256 --> 07:42.782
Yes?

07:42.807 --> 07:44.497
- Yeah.
- Great.

07:47.981 --> 07:50.938
When I was child, I had no real mentors

07:50.963 --> 07:53.830
because all of the grown-ups
around me were so tacky.

07:53.855 --> 07:54.895
Sad.

07:54.920 --> 07:55.575
And it seemed like

07:55.600 --> 07:57.447
all those tacky grown-ups cared about

07:57.472 --> 07:59.979
was whether or not I knew
the capital of Ethiopia.

08:00.004 --> 08:01.237
Addis Ababa.

08:01.481 --> 08:03.817
- What?
- The capital of Ethiopia.

08:04.020 --> 08:04.778
Okay, great.

08:04.803 --> 08:06.737
You know the capital of Ethiopia. Done.

08:06.762 --> 08:09.668
Now, do you know how to
cultivate your own steez

08:09.693 --> 08:11.576
without being a label whore?

08:13.067 --> 08:13.966
Not sure.

08:13.991 --> 08:15.847
Do you know how to fake
it till you make it,

08:15.872 --> 08:18.083
frontin' like you livin' that
five-star, baller-ass lifestyle

08:18.108 --> 08:19.341
when all you really got in your pocket

08:19.373 --> 08:21.878
is a used-up In-N-Out gift card?

08:23.406 --> 08:26.924
Because those are the things
T-Mobile can't teach you.

08:28.721 --> 08:30.428
But I can.

08:31.140 --> 08:32.429
Whoa.

08:33.129 --> 08:38.059
I want this guest
bathroom to be perfect.

08:38.779 --> 08:42.035
Like... mm, Mid-Century?

08:42.061 --> 08:44.428
- I love Mid-Century.
- But Mid-Century now.

08:44.453 --> 08:48.175
- Future farmhouse.
- Okay.

08:48.200 --> 08:51.972
And I want an infinity
sink and infinity towels.

08:51.997 --> 08:54.534
So, like, towels that don't stop?

08:54.559 --> 08:55.892
Yeah, they just go on forever.

08:55.917 --> 08:58.456
Just infinity.

08:59.021 --> 09:00.588
And how many of those do you want?

09:00.613 --> 09:02.085
Just, like, two.

09:03.082 --> 09:05.616
Also, you don't have to
run everything by me.

09:05.883 --> 09:07.382
I'm super easy.

09:07.407 --> 09:08.640
Listen, I'm done.

09:08.665 --> 09:09.879
Let's quit this guy,

09:09.904 --> 09:12.261
go to Fatburger right now, please.

09:12.672 --> 09:14.055
Farro.

09:14.678 --> 09:16.177
I have two words,

09:16.318 --> 09:17.617
and you can call me crazy

09:17.642 --> 09:20.109
or you can call me
crazy like a dang fox.

09:20.461 --> 09:22.434
Rose gold.

09:23.549 --> 09:25.706
Well, I'm a dirty slut for rose gold.

09:25.731 --> 09:26.897
But that's not it.

09:27.112 --> 09:30.893
I'm also seeing a dark, charcoal wash

09:30.918 --> 09:32.284
floor to ceiling.

09:32.309 --> 09:35.511
It will create a caustic,
dystopian landscape...

09:35.536 --> 09:37.239
that will be overthrown

09:37.622 --> 09:40.621
by the luxe, gleaming,
rose gold fixtures.

09:40.646 --> 09:42.802
The juxtaposition will be sublime.

09:42.827 --> 09:46.183
I'm literally... going to vomit... joy.

09:46.284 --> 09:47.517
I love it.

09:47.599 --> 09:51.777
I love this woman, and
I lurve her ideas.

09:52.122 --> 09:55.308
We cannot finish this
project without she.

09:55.699 --> 09:57.166
I'll pay whatever.

09:58.944 --> 09:59.943
I'll work hourly,

09:59.968 --> 10:02.167
and you never have to
speak to Farro again.

10:02.543 --> 10:04.269
- Let's go get that Fatburger.
- Deal?

10:04.294 --> 10:04.871
Deal.

10:06.474 --> 10:10.088
When is the best time to
visit the Grecian Isles?

10:10.113 --> 10:12.377
Uh, before Easter to avoid tourists.

10:12.402 --> 10:13.222
Correct.

10:13.247 --> 10:14.151
Unless, of course,

10:14.176 --> 10:15.981
you want to go to the beach, then...?

10:16.006 --> 10:17.071
Late July.

10:17.096 --> 10:19.508
When is the best time to visit Paris?

10:19.533 --> 10:21.299
- Christmas.
- Trick question.

10:21.324 --> 10:22.557
Paris is passé.

10:22.582 --> 10:24.723
Right. Christmas is always in Zurich.

10:24.748 --> 10:25.995
Yes.

10:26.020 --> 10:28.532
Oop. Time for recess.

10:28.557 --> 10:30.896
So, why don't you go
Nair your upper lip,

10:30.921 --> 10:33.972
have a little grape soda, brush after,

10:33.997 --> 10:36.288
and then I'll see you back here
in three and a half hours.

10:36.313 --> 10:38.180
Okay. Love you, Auntie.

10:38.984 --> 10:40.216
Hey.

10:42.440 --> 10:43.643
How's it going, teach?

10:44.846 --> 10:47.308
I'm not sure whom's teaching whom.

10:47.972 --> 10:49.772
You're supposed to be teaching him.

10:52.270 --> 10:55.370
E-Y. Boom. Triple word score.

10:55.395 --> 10:56.769
- That's four times three.
- That's not a word.

10:56.794 --> 10:58.246
That's 12. "Noodley."

10:58.271 --> 11:00.095
- Oh, my God.
- Yes, it is. "Noodley," right?

11:00.120 --> 11:02.293
Like... Like when you want a
noodle with something, right?

11:02.318 --> 11:03.332
You're noodley.

11:03.357 --> 11:05.353
So it has nothing to do
with eating noodles?

11:05.378 --> 11:08.086
Go ahead. Hm? Challenge me.

11:09.028 --> 11:10.989
- Challenge me.
- I challenge you.

11:11.014 --> 11:13.501
Mm.

11:17.204 --> 11:19.718
I think your ex-wife is
watching us from the window.

11:19.772 --> 11:22.350
What? No, no, she wouldn't.

11:23.551 --> 11:25.244
Oh, yep. That's her.

11:25.269 --> 11:26.521
Lena.

11:26.916 --> 11:28.015
Come on.

11:28.134 --> 11:30.217
Yes, you. Come out here.

11:30.649 --> 11:32.501
Hey!

11:32.526 --> 11:33.592
- Hey.
- Hey.

11:33.617 --> 11:35.037
Look at...

11:35.062 --> 11:36.687
Yeah. Okay.

11:36.712 --> 11:39.687
Um... so, uh, this is Paige.

11:39.712 --> 11:42.557
Paige, uh, this is my ex-wife, Lena,

11:42.582 --> 11:45.773
and our contractor, Vlad.

11:45.798 --> 11:46.470
Hi.

11:46.495 --> 11:48.613
Oh, man. We're moving kind of fast.

11:48.638 --> 11:50.205
I'm not sure I'm ready
to meet your contractor.

11:51.775 --> 11:52.751
Witty!

11:52.776 --> 11:54.187
Quick and witty.

11:54.212 --> 11:55.145
Scrabble, huh?

11:55.190 --> 11:56.491
Uh, yeah. Oh, yeah, yeah.

11:56.516 --> 11:57.940
This one is kicking my ass.

11:57.965 --> 11:59.265
She's up 100 points here.

11:59.328 --> 12:00.781
Ooh!

12:00.806 --> 12:01.681
Mm. Yeah. No.

12:01.706 --> 12:03.117
We... We were in the garage,

12:03.142 --> 12:04.703
but it's getting kind of cramped, so...

12:04.728 --> 12:08.024
Well, please let me be the
first to welcome you.

12:08.049 --> 12:09.281
I already welcomed her.

12:09.306 --> 12:12.392
Well, then let me be the
first person to say howdy.

12:12.982 --> 12:14.345
Howdy-ya-doody.

12:14.370 --> 12:17.939
Wow. You guys are just... so cordial.

12:17.964 --> 12:18.614
Mm.

12:18.639 --> 12:20.252
I mean, you'd have to be, right?

12:20.277 --> 12:21.276
- Right.
- Right.

12:23.941 --> 12:25.073
Right.

12:28.306 --> 12:30.240
- Good night.
- Good night.

12:30.342 --> 12:33.095
Yes, and may I wish you a very...

12:33.796 --> 12:35.629
Lacey Chabert.

12:35.654 --> 12:36.709
Let's go.

12:36.734 --> 12:38.509
"Party of Five"?

12:39.134 --> 12:41.001
Okay, so...

12:41.065 --> 12:42.238
You wanna get a bite to eat?

12:42.263 --> 12:44.074
- Are you kidding me?
- Hm.

12:44.099 --> 12:45.953
You're gonna act like
that did not just happen?

12:45.978 --> 12:47.277
Like what didn't just happen?

12:47.302 --> 12:50.218
Well, I mean, she was so
uncomfortable that I was here.

12:50.243 --> 12:51.148
Oh.

12:51.173 --> 12:53.473
Maybe I just don't get your whole setup.

12:53.498 --> 12:56.016
Right, um, so, uh, every other week...

12:56.041 --> 12:58.655
No, I get it. I just...
I don't understand it.

12:58.680 --> 13:00.013
Look, this is all temporary.

13:00.060 --> 13:01.406
You know, we're gonna sell the house,

13:01.431 --> 13:02.793
we're gonna go our separate ways.

13:02.818 --> 13:04.117
We already talked about it.

13:04.219 --> 13:05.518
Right.

13:05.621 --> 13:07.304
And noodley's a word.

13:07.329 --> 13:08.895
Yes.

13:09.012 --> 13:09.972
Oh.

13:10.334 --> 13:13.721
Don't trick me like that.

13:13.745 --> 13:17.392
Do you think Mr. Crazy will like
these tiles for his shower?

13:17.417 --> 13:19.450
No. It needs to be matte.

13:19.759 --> 13:21.673
Hey, what did you think of Paige?

13:21.698 --> 13:23.244
Uh, I don't know. I mean, she seems...

13:23.269 --> 13:24.055
'Cause I really like her.

13:24.080 --> 13:26.499
She is so, so great.

13:26.524 --> 13:28.924
I mean, what a doll.

13:29.026 --> 13:31.160
But what was up with her
calling us "cordial"?

13:31.212 --> 13:32.612
That's a compliment, no?

13:32.697 --> 13:33.825
Not how she said it.

13:33.850 --> 13:35.416
So you don't like her?

13:35.441 --> 13:36.930
No, I love her.

13:36.955 --> 13:39.222
I just didn't expect her
to be so judgmental.

13:39.324 --> 13:41.591
I mean, do you find
her to be judgmental,

13:41.660 --> 13:42.813
bordering on intolerant?

13:42.838 --> 13:43.837
Uh, I don't know.

13:43.862 --> 13:45.735
All you American women
seem the same to me,

13:45.760 --> 13:49.328
with all your flowy tops
and the shelter dogs.

13:49.353 --> 13:52.274
I'm just surprised that
she's so age-appropriate.

13:52.534 --> 13:55.010
Martin's mostly been dating
younger women, you know,

13:55.035 --> 13:56.891
who are kind of flighty.

13:56.916 --> 13:58.249
Not women like...

13:58.274 --> 13:59.756
Paige!

14:01.510 --> 14:02.997
Yeah, I see now.

14:03.022 --> 14:04.689
You're still in love
with your ex-husband.

14:04.767 --> 14:06.711
- What? No.
- Mm-hmm.

14:06.759 --> 14:08.458
That's why we fix the garage.

14:08.560 --> 14:10.474
More construction means more time,

14:10.499 --> 14:11.532
you don't sell the house,

14:11.557 --> 14:14.122
and then get him back in your clutches.

14:14.147 --> 14:15.746
I'm fine with Martin dating.

14:15.848 --> 14:17.204
I just want him to be with someone

14:17.229 --> 14:19.945
who's more on board with our
current living situation.

14:19.970 --> 14:22.437
But he is not on board with it.

14:22.539 --> 14:24.006
And I'm hoping to change that.

14:24.074 --> 14:25.150
Because you're still in love.

14:25.175 --> 14:26.241
I am not.

14:26.266 --> 14:28.550
I am going to be in a relationship, too,

14:28.575 --> 14:29.462
at some point.

14:29.487 --> 14:32.079
Honey, you are already
in a relationship.

14:32.331 --> 14:33.330
With him.

14:33.355 --> 14:34.438
No.

14:34.463 --> 14:36.677
I am a single woman.

14:36.702 --> 14:38.392
You don't put out single-woman vibes.

14:38.417 --> 14:40.099
I put out major single-woman vibes.

14:40.124 --> 14:42.357
To me, you feel off the market.

14:42.435 --> 14:43.597
Well, I'm not off the market.

14:43.622 --> 14:46.516
I am on the market. I
am an open house, baby.

14:46.541 --> 14:48.087
Anyone in this
neighborhood could come by

14:48.112 --> 14:50.290
and just walk right through my...

15:05.358 --> 15:06.948
No heat.

15:08.979 --> 15:11.871
Because you caught me off-guard.

15:13.362 --> 15:14.944
If I knew you were gonna kiss me,

15:14.969 --> 15:17.084
I would've brought my "A" -game.

15:17.838 --> 15:19.629
One more try.

15:21.102 --> 15:22.973
No more tries.

15:24.673 --> 15:25.968
Hey!

15:26.471 --> 15:29.054
Hey, you work for me.

15:29.296 --> 15:32.308
You get back here and
kiss me one more time!

15:43.811 --> 15:45.377
You looking for something?

15:45.402 --> 15:48.074
I was just showing Paige
our old record player.

15:48.673 --> 15:49.706
You're not gonna seduce her

15:49.731 --> 15:51.326
using Coldplay on vinyl, are you?

15:51.351 --> 15:53.303
Um, no.

15:53.518 --> 15:55.595
I retired that album on you.

15:55.907 --> 15:57.108
Good.

15:57.506 --> 15:59.793
Hm. Plans for the garage?

15:59.818 --> 16:01.462
Actually, it's for a client.

16:01.487 --> 16:02.520
A client?

16:02.545 --> 16:04.533
Yeah. I forgot to tell you...

16:04.558 --> 16:07.202
Vlad hired me to consult
on one of his remodels.

16:07.227 --> 16:08.417
Wow, seriously?

16:08.442 --> 16:09.371
Seriously.

16:09.396 --> 16:11.137
Hm.

16:11.162 --> 16:12.556
Is that funny?

16:13.089 --> 16:15.770
No. No, no, no. I think
it's, uh, it's awesome.

16:15.795 --> 16:16.928
You'd be great at that.

16:16.953 --> 16:18.723
- Well, thanks.
- Mm-hmm.

16:20.283 --> 16:23.708
Martin, I need to explain something.

16:23.733 --> 16:26.500
Oh, about the spying? Yeah.

16:26.589 --> 16:28.535
Yeah, a-and it didn't
help to convince Paige

16:28.560 --> 16:30.727
that our situation is chill, by the way.

16:30.752 --> 16:32.676
Aha, so she doesn't think it's chill.

16:32.701 --> 16:34.348
Because it's not chill.

16:35.069 --> 16:36.860
- Why were you watching us?
- I'm not.

16:36.901 --> 16:39.753
I-I thought there was a wasps' nest...

16:39.778 --> 16:41.270
- Mm.
- Hanging from the garage,

16:41.302 --> 16:43.102
so actually, I was looking
out for you guys.

16:43.127 --> 16:44.671
Okay. Hey.

16:44.696 --> 16:46.043
Thank you. Got it.

16:46.068 --> 16:47.535
I'll let her know.

16:47.580 --> 16:48.779
Totally chill.

16:48.804 --> 16:52.090
I just live with my ex-wife
and a bunch of wasps.

16:52.629 --> 16:54.035
And our three kids.

16:54.262 --> 16:55.191
Them, too.

16:55.216 --> 16:57.881
Just keeps getting better and better.

16:59.089 --> 17:01.771
And don't forget our turtle, Josh.

17:03.934 --> 17:06.160
And everything he stands for.

17:15.667 --> 17:16.800
Camille, my dove,

17:16.967 --> 17:19.003
you know I'm not one to
confront you about anything.

17:19.337 --> 17:20.803
When we first started dating,

17:20.828 --> 17:23.159
I let you call me Anton
for about six months.

17:23.184 --> 17:25.316
Hm, I miss the Anton days.

17:25.387 --> 17:27.140
And, Gun-Woo, I love your sound,

17:27.165 --> 17:29.499
and I'm not really trying to
rock the boat or anything,

17:29.593 --> 17:34.096
but I think there might be some
major holes in your curriculum.

17:35.668 --> 17:36.751
Name one.

17:36.776 --> 17:37.766
Science.

17:37.791 --> 17:38.723
False.

17:38.825 --> 17:40.473
We studied geology yesterday.

17:43.475 --> 17:45.023
It's a little cloudy.

17:45.826 --> 17:46.925
Good catch.

17:46.950 --> 17:48.402
And after that, we did P.E.

17:50.421 --> 17:52.059
And then we started history.

17:52.205 --> 17:56.145
See, this is her face in 2002,
and this is her face now.

17:56.170 --> 17:58.668
Show me where she's had work done.

18:01.497 --> 18:03.196
Bitch got a new chin.

18:03.275 --> 18:06.473
Is he actually learning
anything academic?

18:06.893 --> 18:10.861
Gun-Woo, if I take four
30-minute Pilates classes

18:10.886 --> 18:12.830
for every one 45-minute barre class,

18:12.855 --> 18:15.562
how many hours of total
exercise have I done

18:15.587 --> 18:18.255
if I've done three barre classes?

18:19.661 --> 18:23.501
8 hours and 15 minutes, Auntie.

18:24.767 --> 18:25.728
Satisfied?

18:25.753 --> 18:27.642
I am so sorry, baby.

18:27.667 --> 18:29.167
I had no idea how detailed and...

18:29.192 --> 18:30.992
Bup, bup, bup, bup, bup.

18:31.404 --> 18:32.903
We're in the middle of a lesson here.

18:32.928 --> 18:34.494
Forgive my insolence.

18:34.748 --> 18:36.482
I will make it up to you.

18:36.507 --> 18:39.486
Perhaps a vacation to
Zurich for Christmas?

18:47.403 --> 18:49.728
- Hey.
- Hey.

18:51.530 --> 18:54.376
Paige, um, I was just...

18:55.383 --> 18:58.722
I felt like there was some
awkwardness when we first met.

18:58.828 --> 19:00.428
I felt like I was awkward.

19:00.453 --> 19:02.187
Yeah, you were.

19:02.212 --> 19:03.745
Oh. Great.

19:03.895 --> 19:05.108
Same "page."

19:07.131 --> 19:09.932
I just... I know that
this whole arrangement

19:09.957 --> 19:11.923
might seem a little odd,

19:12.039 --> 19:14.406
but I'm proud of what we have here.

19:14.431 --> 19:17.494
I mean, I'm... I'm more than proud.
I cherish it.

19:18.101 --> 19:20.678
But I could see how, if I
were the new girl coming in,

19:20.703 --> 19:22.579
I might not like it very much.

19:22.604 --> 19:24.037
But you have to understand,

19:24.062 --> 19:27.072
there are three kids who
still need two parents,

19:27.097 --> 19:29.336
and we all count on each other.

19:29.610 --> 19:33.132
So I guess what I'm hoping
this breakfast will say is,

19:33.157 --> 19:35.801
thank you in advance for
your understanding.

19:37.511 --> 19:38.884
Mm.

19:40.957 --> 19:42.390
Mmm.

19:42.546 --> 19:46.244
So, that whole innocent,

19:46.269 --> 19:48.936
disenfranchised homemaker routine,

19:49.356 --> 19:50.989
people are buying that?

19:51.014 --> 19:53.767
Beg pardon?

19:53.792 --> 19:55.487
I've got your number, lady.

19:56.353 --> 19:58.048
And it has nothing to do with your kids

19:58.073 --> 20:00.206
or your home or the co-parenting.

20:00.617 --> 20:02.737
And it has everything to do with you

20:02.780 --> 20:05.009
and your unresolved feelings for Martin.

20:05.034 --> 20:06.720
Babe, where'd you go?

20:06.899 --> 20:08.458
Nowhere, hon.

20:08.483 --> 20:09.908
Look!

20:10.373 --> 20:12.106
We've got breakfast in bed.

20:24.272 --> 20:25.598
Here we go.

20:25.623 --> 20:27.690
Black, like your soul.

20:27.745 --> 20:30.058
Just for the record, I take 11 sugars.

20:30.083 --> 20:31.440
Ew.

20:32.499 --> 20:34.592
I might have another design job for you,

20:34.617 --> 20:36.451
a house in Bel Air.

20:36.476 --> 20:38.976
They have lots of money
and terrible taste.

20:39.001 --> 20:40.042
I'm in.

20:40.067 --> 20:41.549
Oh, Mr. Crazy

20:41.574 --> 20:43.207
hired a professional photographer

20:43.232 --> 20:44.347
to take pictures of your bathroom.

20:44.372 --> 20:46.580
- You want to see?
- Of course.

20:47.541 --> 20:49.074
All right, here.

20:49.287 --> 20:52.707
I really love what we did
with the hardware and...

21:14.961 --> 21:16.844
That time, I caught you off-guard.
