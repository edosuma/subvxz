02:04.209 --> 02:05.626
Hello.

02:06.418 --> 02:08.084
Good day to you.

02:12.209 --> 02:15.126
Are you heading by the overpass?

02:15.834 --> 02:17.668
The second one?

02:17.834 --> 02:20.918
Yes, the one after this.

02:39.459 --> 02:40.334
Thanks.

02:54.626 --> 02:56.168
What's that?

02:58.459 --> 03:00.668
That thing you put here.

03:04.168 --> 03:05.001
This?

03:05.584 --> 03:07.293
An antitheft device?

03:07.793 --> 03:09.501
Yes, sort of.

03:09.959 --> 03:13.209
It looks pretty cool.

03:14.251 --> 03:16.668
Really? You know what it is?

03:17.584 --> 03:19.668
It's sort of my line of work.

03:20.709 --> 03:22.668
Trust me on this.

03:23.001 --> 03:25.126
You have to be careful.

03:25.293 --> 03:29.751
A cousin of mine, poor guy,
he left the house,

03:29.918 --> 03:32.334
got in his car to go to work

03:32.501 --> 03:37.543
only to notice
all 4 tyres were replaced by bricks.

03:37.709 --> 03:38.709
What make?

03:38.876 --> 03:40.126
A real cheap car!

03:40.293 --> 03:42.793
Honestly, stealing such a jalopy!

03:43.209 --> 03:45.668
If I were head of state,

03:45.834 --> 03:49.959
I'd hang a couple of them
just to shake them up.

03:50.459 --> 03:56.168
Hang them?
Quick to dispense with others' lives!

03:56.334 --> 04:00.043
Maybe the poor guy did it out of need!

04:01.751 --> 04:03.418
Can't believe my ears.

04:03.584 --> 04:06.751
Need? What are you talking about?

04:06.918 --> 04:08.418
Maybe he was in need.

04:08.584 --> 04:12.334
Our driver must be even more in need.

04:12.501 --> 04:14.251
Not to mention me!

04:14.418 --> 04:17.750
No excuse to make people worse off.

04:18.000 --> 04:19.834
What are you saying?

04:20.000 --> 04:22.668
Would you like if it happened to you?

04:22.834 --> 04:24.501
Would that be fun?

04:24.668 --> 04:28.668
No, I wouldn't be happy
if it happened to me.

04:28.834 --> 04:32.084
I'm just saying you're quick
to hand out death sentences.

04:32.251 --> 04:35.918
We need to get to the roots
of the problem.

04:36.751 --> 04:38.709
If they took two of them...

04:38.876 --> 04:41.001
No one's born a thief!

04:41.168 --> 04:43.126
What the hell?

04:43.293 --> 04:47.876
If they hang two people,
the others would get it.

04:48.043 --> 04:51.043
I understand, but you're wrong.

04:51.209 --> 04:55.334
Circumstances arise, crimes happen.

04:55.501 --> 04:58.001
But hang people for tyres?

04:58.168 --> 05:00.334
Your logic is skewed!

05:00.501 --> 05:03.334
Not that long ago,

05:03.501 --> 05:06.209
two people got hanged
for much less.

05:06.376 --> 05:09.543
What's the difference? It may help.

05:09.709 --> 05:11.084
Spare me.

05:11.251 --> 05:13.751
You're in another world!

05:13.918 --> 05:19.334
Sure I heard they got hanged
for assault or whatever.

05:19.501 --> 05:22.834
So what? Did anyone learn a lesson?

05:23.001 --> 05:25.209
You're talking nonsense.

05:25.376 --> 05:27.918
No problems were solved...

05:28.084 --> 05:31.793
The law and Sharia have spoken.

05:32.126 --> 05:36.626
If the problem
hasn't been solved by now,

05:36.793 --> 05:39.084
they weren't applied properly.

05:39.251 --> 05:42.001
So chill out, lady!

05:42.168 --> 05:45.584
So applying Sharia
solves all our problems

05:45.751 --> 05:48.793
by increasing the number of executions?

05:48.959 --> 05:53.751
After China,
we have the most executions in the world!

05:53.918 --> 05:57.001
You call that solved? No!

05:57.168 --> 06:00.126
You don't understand jack shit!

06:00.293 --> 06:02.751
You're totally clueless, lady.

06:02.918 --> 06:04.709
The Parssian Hospital?

06:04.876 --> 06:06.501
Straight ahead.

06:06.668 --> 06:08.501
Straight and you get there.

06:08.668 --> 06:12.043
No, that's the wrong way for Parssian!

06:12.209 --> 06:16.168
Saadat Abad,
between Kaj Square and Farhang.

06:16.334 --> 06:17.959
So I make a U-turn?

06:18.126 --> 06:20.668
Yeah, go to Saadat Abad.

06:21.751 --> 06:22.626
Hadji...

06:23.168 --> 06:25.543
you're not a driver, are you?

06:26.251 --> 06:27.834
What do you mean?

06:28.168 --> 06:30.209
You call yourself a cabbie!

06:30.918 --> 06:32.418
Is this even possible?

06:33.001 --> 06:37.043
Not knowing how to get
to the Parssian Hospital?

06:37.209 --> 06:38.876
Straight ahead...

06:39.376 --> 06:41.834
I guess you're really down and out.

06:42.001 --> 06:43.876
You've hit rock bottom.

06:44.043 --> 06:45.043
What's up?

06:45.543 --> 06:49.293
I follow you,
but now that we're chatting,

06:49.459 --> 06:52.168
may I please ask you a question?

06:52.334 --> 06:53.501
Shoot, lady!

06:53.668 --> 06:55.209
What's your job?

06:55.376 --> 06:58.543
What does this have to do with anything?

06:58.709 --> 07:00.126
It's related.

07:00.293 --> 07:03.959
When you defend an idea,
either you believe in it

07:04.126 --> 07:05.668
or it's in your interest.

07:05.959 --> 07:08.709
It's not out of the blue.
What's your job?

07:08.959 --> 07:12.334
What's yours, with this grilling?

07:12.501 --> 07:14.001
You'll answer if I do?

07:14.168 --> 07:17.209
You go first, maybe I'll follow.

07:17.459 --> 07:18.959
I'm a teacher.

07:22.126 --> 07:23.793
It figures, hadji.

07:23.959 --> 07:25.918
You work in fiction, lady.

07:26.084 --> 07:30.543
Reading too many books
and spending days with kids

07:30.709 --> 07:33.543
has made your talk sound like fiction.

07:33.709 --> 07:37.459
Even if you hadn't told me,
I'd have guessed.

07:37.626 --> 07:39.751
Now tell me what you do.

07:39.918 --> 07:42.334
My work is freelance.

07:42.501 --> 07:44.459
I'll tell you my speciality later.

07:44.876 --> 07:48.251
I'll get off there
after the lights, please.

07:48.876 --> 07:50.293
How much?

07:50.459 --> 07:51.793
No need to pay.

07:54.168 --> 07:55.126
Damn!

07:55.293 --> 07:58.209
You're definitely no taxi driver!

07:58.626 --> 08:01.251
You screwed up a couple of times.

08:01.918 --> 08:05.251
What exactly do you freelance at?

08:05.418 --> 08:08.084
I'll get out and tell you...

08:09.334 --> 08:11.751
You really want the truth?

08:12.293 --> 08:13.043
I do.

08:13.209 --> 08:15.376
My speciality is mugger.

08:15.543 --> 08:16.626
Mugger?

08:16.793 --> 08:17.709
Yes.

08:17.876 --> 08:22.709
But I don't mug teachers
or cab drivers like him.

08:23.084 --> 08:27.001
People who rob the tyres of the poor

08:27.168 --> 08:28.959
can't stoop any lower.

08:29.126 --> 08:31.376
Losers of the worst kind.

08:31.543 --> 08:35.043
Take my advice. Don't pity them!

08:35.751 --> 08:37.083
God bless.

08:37.376 --> 08:38.793
Unbelievable.

08:39.208 --> 08:41.043
Where did he come from?

08:47.126 --> 08:48.543
How are you?

08:48.709 --> 08:51.501
Be there in 10 minutes. Okay...

08:52.209 --> 08:53.709
10 minutes.

08:53.918 --> 08:56.293
I'll get off a bit further on.

08:57.709 --> 08:58.668
Here?

08:58.834 --> 08:59.876
Yes, thanks.

09:02.334 --> 09:03.959
Here's the fare.

09:04.126 --> 09:05.668
Thank you.

09:24.209 --> 09:26.626
I'll hire your taxi just for me.

09:26.793 --> 09:28.751
- Shariaty?
- Sorry, no.

09:37.334 --> 09:40.543
Mr. Panahi, I recognize you.

09:42.751 --> 09:45.376
Even with the beret,
I recognize you.

09:47.959 --> 09:50.793
Can you stop
so I can sit in front?

09:52.626 --> 09:53.834
Thank you.

10:11.876 --> 10:13.334
Thanks very much.

10:18.626 --> 10:21.668
You're making a movie, right?

10:21.834 --> 10:24.543
The man and the woman...

10:25.126 --> 10:29.126
Take a left, thanks.
To Shahran.

10:30.543 --> 10:32.626
They were actors, right?

10:33.084 --> 10:35.001
Know how I figured it out?

10:35.168 --> 10:38.876
His last line was
like in the coffee shop scene

10:39.043 --> 10:41.793
in "Crimson Gold", wasn't it?

10:43.043 --> 10:46.126
You, a cabbie? No way, Mr. Panahi.

10:46.334 --> 10:48.001
Ajob like another.

10:48.168 --> 10:51.959
Sure, but you're not in your element!

10:54.709 --> 10:56.793
You really don't recognize me?

10:58.709 --> 11:01.376
I must have forgotten.

11:02.084 --> 11:03.793
I'm Omid.

11:04.209 --> 11:05.334
Omid who?

11:06.793 --> 11:08.626
Omid the video renter!

11:09.918 --> 11:11.626
I used to bring you movies!

11:11.793 --> 11:14.168
For your son, I mean. Not you.

11:14.668 --> 11:17.584
You were there once.

11:17.793 --> 11:20.626
I said “Hello, how are you?”

11:20.793 --> 11:22.834
You said “Fine, dear boy!”

11:23.001 --> 11:26.418
You wanted
"Once Upon a Time in Anatolia"

11:26.584 --> 11:28.751
by Nuri Ceylan. I gave it to you.

11:29.668 --> 11:32.043
Why are you sweating so much?

11:33.834 --> 11:35.209
It's so hot.

11:35.459 --> 11:37.959
You wanted another movie too,
remember?

11:41.334 --> 11:42.168
I don't!

11:42.334 --> 11:45.376
“Midnight in Paris”, Woody Allen!

11:45.543 --> 11:47.751
- That was you.
- Of course!

12:02.168 --> 12:04.293
It hasn't opened yet.

12:04.668 --> 12:06.918
You haven't seen a thing!

12:07.834 --> 12:12.043
I can bring you dailies
of movies in the making.

12:24.709 --> 12:25.959
Call you back.

12:34.126 --> 12:35.209
Put him in!

12:37.918 --> 12:40.209
Chamran Hospital.

12:40.418 --> 12:42.918
Why on earth Chamran?

12:43.084 --> 12:45.043
Go to Milad. He's poor!

12:46.376 --> 12:49.793
Where is it? How do I get there?

12:53.584 --> 12:55.584
Go on, step on it.

12:55.751 --> 12:56.876
What happened?

12:57.043 --> 12:58.543
An accident.

12:58.709 --> 13:00.751
I'm dying-n

13:00.918 --> 13:02.834
A bike accident.

13:06.418 --> 13:08.251
Not my fault.

13:08.418 --> 13:11.459
I said he should be the one
with the helmet.

13:12.876 --> 13:14.251
Some paper...

13:19.251 --> 13:22.793
No, I want to write my will.

13:26.793 --> 13:31.043
Please find some paper
to write what I must say.

13:31.209 --> 13:33.209
What does he want exactly?

13:33.501 --> 13:35.418
Write down what I tell you.

13:36.126 --> 13:38.209
My wife doesn't get it.

13:38.376 --> 13:41.043
According to law, she can't inherit.

13:41.876 --> 13:45.084
At most she'll get a few turkeys.

13:45.334 --> 13:48.668
She'll be homeless!

13:49.043 --> 13:53.418
Drive faster! Go to the hospital.

13:53.584 --> 13:56.084
A cell phone! You have one?

13:58.459 --> 14:00.543
It's not to make a call.

14:00.751 --> 14:02.376
I need a camera.

14:03.459 --> 14:04.668
Turn it on.

14:04.834 --> 14:06.626
Mine has no battery.

14:14.959 --> 14:16.293
The camera...

14:19.543 --> 14:20.876
Point it at me.

14:23.209 --> 14:24.668
Film me!

14:24.834 --> 14:27.001
God be my witness!

14:27.751 --> 14:30.418
My name is Mohamadi Rabei,

14:30.751 --> 14:32.793
born in Ramhormoz.

14:33.459 --> 14:37.293
ID number 508,

14:37.459 --> 14:39.709
issued in Ramhormoz.

14:39.876 --> 14:43.543
Don't cry. They won't hear my voice.

14:43.709 --> 14:45.418
Son of Amin,

14:45.668 --> 14:49.376
sound of mind and body,

14:49.668 --> 14:53.126
I leave my wife my house
in the Hassan Kahn area

14:53.293 --> 14:57.251
Spring Street, lzadi Alley number 34,

14:57.418 --> 15:00.751
and all my belongings.

15:02.459 --> 15:05.376
Forgive me, God!

15:05.793 --> 15:09.626
My brothers should leave her in peace.

15:10.459 --> 15:12.793
They mustn't file a claim.

15:13.334 --> 15:16.793
They must respect
this last will and testament.

15:16.959 --> 15:19.376
I leave everything to my wife.

15:19.918 --> 15:21.084
This testament

15:22.418 --> 15:25.209
must be kept from my brothers.
It's hers.

15:25.793 --> 15:27.584
She should keep it.

15:28.293 --> 15:32.168
There is no God but Allah...

16:04.251 --> 16:05.918
Help him out.

16:08.793 --> 16:10.543
Give me a hand.

16:35.293 --> 16:38.626
It's not necessary. Go with him!

16:56.584 --> 16:58.168
She's coming back.

16:58.918 --> 17:03.584
Please give me
the film of the will, sir.

17:03.751 --> 17:06.001
I can't now. Call me later.

17:08.084 --> 17:10.876
My card. I'll give it to you later.

17:11.834 --> 17:15.167
Move your car. Ambulance coming!

17:28.209 --> 17:29.293
Here you go.

17:31.918 --> 17:33.084
Did he die?

17:33.626 --> 17:36.376
He's fine. He was just scared.

17:37.126 --> 17:39.251
He was in very bad shape.

17:40.626 --> 17:42.959
He closed his eyes at the end.

17:53.834 --> 17:54.959
This is he.

17:55.626 --> 17:56.751
Is it you, madam?

17:57.418 --> 17:58.751
No, ma'am.

17:58.918 --> 18:01.959
Rest assured. This is my number.

18:04.043 --> 18:05.168
Sure...

18:06.376 --> 18:09.168
I'll call you as soon as I can.

18:10.918 --> 18:12.168
Good bye.

18:14.709 --> 18:16.084
Was it her?

18:17.751 --> 18:19.334
The husband died?

18:19.793 --> 18:21.751
Just to make sure.

18:21.918 --> 18:24.834
She was checking the number.

18:26.334 --> 18:32.084
You planned it all
and thought I wouldn't guess...

18:37.459 --> 18:39.293
Damn, no more battery.

18:39.709 --> 18:42.959
May I use yours to make a call?

18:43.793 --> 18:44.959
Thanks.

18:45.126 --> 18:47.209
Let me do the code.

18:55.293 --> 18:58.334
Hi, how is it going? In 10 minutes.

18:58.501 --> 19:02.543
Relax, I'll be there.
I had something to do.

19:03.043 --> 19:06.584
What do you mean,
I keep saying in 10 minutes?

19:06.751 --> 19:08.001
Okay...

19:08.334 --> 19:10.959
I'll be there in 10.

19:13.168 --> 19:14.793
Thank you very much.

19:34.751 --> 19:36.668
The 6th street, please.

19:42.543 --> 19:44.168
This is the 4th...

19:47.001 --> 19:49.251
Get ready to take a left.

20:04.584 --> 20:06.959
All the way to the end.

20:10.001 --> 20:12.168
Pull up next to the white car.

20:20.626 --> 20:22.459
Can you unlock?

20:42.001 --> 20:43.959
Hello? Who is it?

20:44.334 --> 20:46.001
<i>Is this the taxi driver?</i>

20:46.376 --> 20:47.918
How can I help you?

20:49.459 --> 20:52.626
<i>I'm the woman
with the injured husband.</i>

20:52.793 --> 20:54.293
<i>You took us to hospital.</i>

20:54.459 --> 20:57.043
Sure, I recognize you.

20:57.293 --> 21:00.209
You've changed your number,
haven't you?

21:01.626 --> 21:03.418
<i>It's my husband's phone.</i>

21:03.626 --> 21:07.959
<i>I wanted to tell you,
now that I'm in town,</i>

21:08.126 --> 21:11.168
<i>can I come and get it?</i>

21:12.043 --> 21:13.293
Get what?

21:14.668 --> 21:15.834
<i>The video, obviously.</i>

21:16.168 --> 21:18.334
I thought he was better.

21:18.584 --> 21:20.084
<i>He is...</i>

21:20.751 --> 21:24.501
<i>but you never know about tomorrow.</i>

21:24.668 --> 21:27.459
<i>I'd like to keep it handy, just in case.</i>

21:28.626 --> 21:33.793
I'll let you know once I make a copy.

21:35.209 --> 21:36.709
<i>Don't call this number.</i>

21:36.876 --> 21:38.959
<i>Call my cell.</i>

21:39.376 --> 21:41.126
<i>Please don't forget.</i>

21:41.293 --> 21:45.751
I won't. Don't worry, I'll definitely call.

21:46.168 --> 21:48.293
<i>God bless you. Goodbye.</i>

22:07.418 --> 22:09.334
Mr. Panahi! Hi!

22:10.209 --> 22:12.209
Please come inside.

22:12.376 --> 22:14.126
I'm fine, thanks.

22:22.959 --> 22:24.126
Have a look.

22:24.918 --> 22:27.334
Go in. Relax, he's one of us.

22:30.209 --> 22:34.209
I brought you "Walking Dead", season 5.

22:34.376 --> 22:35.918
No zombie movies.

22:36.084 --> 22:37.293
You asked for it.

22:37.459 --> 22:38.251
For my family.

22:38.418 --> 22:40.376
You asked for it. Here it is.

22:41.126 --> 22:45.084
And I brought you
4 Hollywood blockbusters.

22:45.251 --> 22:46.334
Mel Gibson...

22:46.501 --> 22:48.334
No commercial stuff.

22:48.626 --> 22:49.834
Art house?

22:50.001 --> 22:51.459
Yeah, like what?

22:52.834 --> 22:54.793
I have a Kim du...

22:55.001 --> 22:56.126
Kim du who?

22:56.293 --> 22:57.418
The Korean guy!

22:59.626 --> 23:02.001
This is a rare old Kurosawa.

23:02.168 --> 23:03.209
Just for you.

23:03.376 --> 23:05.126
The last one I have.

23:05.918 --> 23:06.834
Get it?

23:07.001 --> 23:09.168
This is arty too.

23:15.168 --> 23:16.376
Yes?

23:17.876 --> 23:21.001
Wrong number. Who is it?

23:22.668 --> 23:24.418
Hold on...

23:25.543 --> 23:27.293
Mr. Omid, it's for you.

23:27.459 --> 23:28.751
Who is it?

23:28.918 --> 23:30.543
He didn't say.

23:38.168 --> 23:39.459
Just a minute.

23:39.626 --> 23:41.043
Keep on looking.

23:48.918 --> 23:49.959
Mr.Panahi...

23:51.626 --> 23:54.668
I'm confused about what to take.

23:54.834 --> 23:59.209
It's hard to believe
you're partners with Omid.

23:59.959 --> 24:02.251
- Who said we're partners?
- He did!

24:09.001 --> 24:11.543
I've seen most of the famous classics.

24:11.709 --> 24:15.001
Which new ones are worth watching?

24:16.459 --> 24:17.751
Let's see.

24:17.959 --> 24:20.918
I think all movies are worth watching.

24:21.084 --> 24:23.543
Depends on your taste.

24:25.918 --> 24:29.334
I feel bad. You should have come inside.

24:29.501 --> 24:31.459
I'm fine.

24:31.626 --> 24:32.876
This is good.

24:36.709 --> 24:37.876
This too.

24:40.251 --> 24:42.209
Can I ask a favor?

24:42.376 --> 24:43.334
Sure.

24:43.501 --> 24:46.834
I'm studying film. I have to make a short.

24:47.001 --> 24:49.126
- What major?
- Directing.

24:49.293 --> 24:50.918
- School of Arts?
- Yes.

24:51.084 --> 24:52.834
I'm looking for a good subject.

24:53.001 --> 24:56.293
I've seen movies, read lots of books

24:56.459 --> 24:59.543
but can't find a good subject.

25:01.918 --> 25:03.043
Listen,

25:03.584 --> 25:07.293
those films are already made,
those books already written.

25:09.001 --> 25:11.376
You have to look elsewhere.

25:11.543 --> 25:13.751
It won't come just by itself.

25:13.918 --> 25:16.751
What do I do? Where do I start?

25:16.918 --> 25:18.376
This is the hardest part.

25:19.709 --> 25:21.584
No one can tell you.

25:21.751 --> 25:23.834
You must find it yourself.

25:25.501 --> 25:26.501
Thanks.

25:32.376 --> 25:33.709
Thank you, sir.

25:34.126 --> 25:35.459
What did you pick?

25:35.626 --> 25:36.668
These.

25:39.543 --> 25:41.001
All these?

25:43.834 --> 25:45.459
45 tomans.

25:53.084 --> 25:55.376
I'll bring “Big Bang Theory” next week.

25:58.209 --> 25:59.293
Okay...

26:00.793 --> 26:02.543
Same time, next week.

26:08.168 --> 26:10.459
Mr.Panahi,
I still wish you'd come in.

26:10.626 --> 26:13.251
You're very kind.

26:13.418 --> 26:15.168
Good bye.

26:23.126 --> 26:25.084
So we're partners now?

26:48.168 --> 26:49.793
<i>The door is open.</i>

26:55.834 --> 26:58.168
Please give us a lift.

26:58.334 --> 27:01.418
We're in a rush.
We've been waiting for a cab.

27:01.584 --> 27:03.251
Where to?

27:04.209 --> 27:05.126
Ali's Spring.

27:05.334 --> 27:06.751
Ali's Spring...

27:08.584 --> 27:11.668
- We're really late.
- Different directions!

27:11.834 --> 27:13.043
Keep quiet!

27:13.209 --> 27:14.418
Please, sir.

27:14.584 --> 27:16.543
We have until noon.

27:17.168 --> 27:18.334
Please take us.

27:18.501 --> 27:22.209
I'll drive you closer.
He'll get out soon.

27:22.376 --> 27:23.126
Wait a sec.

27:24.876 --> 27:27.459
Use that door. I'll move my bag.

27:35.334 --> 27:37.168
I hope we make it on time.

27:47.793 --> 27:49.209
Scoot over.

27:51.376 --> 27:53.751
Don't get the car wet.

27:57.543 --> 28:00.418
You kept complaining
but we found a cab.

28:00.584 --> 28:01.959
What if we're late?

28:02.126 --> 28:05.501
Of course we won't be late.
It'll be fine.

28:07.168 --> 28:08.876
Believe me...

28:09.043 --> 28:11.834
I didn't mean to say that.

28:12.293 --> 28:14.918
Usually he just takes a few videos.

28:15.543 --> 28:17.918
This time he took so many.

28:18.084 --> 28:20.001
It was because of you.

28:20.626 --> 28:23.584
If you came along to my other clients...

28:24.418 --> 28:26.626
you'd make a fortune.

28:27.418 --> 28:29.168
As partners, right?

28:30.918 --> 28:33.751
This a cultural activity too.

28:34.626 --> 28:36.834
They don't show these movies in Iran.

28:37.001 --> 28:39.543
How else can students see foreign movies?

28:40.793 --> 28:42.626
Your own son!

28:43.209 --> 28:44.584
Even you!

28:45.168 --> 28:47.376
Without me, no more Woody Allen!

28:50.834 --> 28:52.834
At home

28:53.001 --> 28:54.334
it's just us.

28:54.584 --> 28:56.126
Why shut the bathroom door?

28:56.293 --> 28:59.293
No one to spy on your beautiful body!

29:01.334 --> 29:04.251
It's not good to be too carefree.

29:04.418 --> 29:08.626
Overly carefree people
get on others' nerves...

29:09.334 --> 29:11.376
- You mean yourself.
- Yes!

29:11.543 --> 29:14.251
You're always on edge.

29:18.168 --> 29:21.709
Dear fellow, you can get off here.

29:29.543 --> 29:30.459
Here?

29:30.626 --> 29:33.751
You can catch another taxi here.

29:37.834 --> 29:39.459
What do I owe you?

29:40.918 --> 29:44.209
Keep it for your cultural activity!

29:49.126 --> 29:51.334
- It's locked.
- I got it.

30:02.793 --> 30:05.001
He doesn't give up.

30:06.251 --> 30:07.459
Believe me,

30:07.626 --> 30:10.668
I just meant it as a favor.

30:11.043 --> 30:13.959
On my wife's life,
I meant no disrespect!

30:14.126 --> 30:16.084
The best I could do.

30:16.626 --> 30:18.834
You're too kind. Thanks...

30:24.251 --> 30:27.251
Excuse me, is your clock right?

30:27.501 --> 30:29.043
Let me check...

30:34.293 --> 30:36.709
A few minutes behind.

30:37.209 --> 30:39.293
How far is the spring?

30:39.709 --> 30:43.751
Ali's Spring? Depends on the traffic.

30:44.543 --> 30:47.418
Can we make it before noon?

30:47.584 --> 30:48.918
I hope so.

30:49.084 --> 30:52.418
We'll make it even with traffic?

30:53.126 --> 30:54.751
I can't say.

30:55.793 --> 30:58.751
Go faster
and we'll make it, God willing!

30:59.001 --> 31:02.043
God willing?
We must be on time!

31:02.209 --> 31:04.876
No later than noon!

31:05.918 --> 31:07.584
Excuse me...

31:20.876 --> 31:23.751
Most people spend the afternoon.
Why so early?

31:23.918 --> 31:27.293
This isn't for fun. it's very serious!

31:27.501 --> 31:30.293
These fish must be in the spring
exactly at 12.

31:30.459 --> 31:32.334
Don't you get it?

31:32.501 --> 31:34.334
Our lives depend on it.

31:34.668 --> 31:36.668
In the water by 12!

31:36.834 --> 31:39.084
Our lives depend on it!

31:51.418 --> 31:53.626
Oh my God, the fish are dying!

31:55.543 --> 31:57.709
Sir, hurry!

31:59.959 --> 32:03.168
Please hurry! They're dying!

32:05.793 --> 32:07.418
Too much emotion!

32:09.251 --> 32:10.876
Hurry, they're dying!

32:11.043 --> 32:12.751
Lift your foot.

32:13.793 --> 32:15.001
They're dying!

32:16.334 --> 32:17.584
Don't squash them.

32:17.751 --> 32:19.793
Faster!

32:22.834 --> 32:23.918
Pour it in.

32:25.793 --> 32:28.084
Quick, put the fish inside!

32:28.251 --> 32:29.501
Enough water!

32:29.668 --> 32:31.418
They'll be fine.

32:31.584 --> 32:33.334
Just a minute.

32:34.043 --> 32:35.584
Is it dead?

32:39.168 --> 32:40.751
Just a minute.

32:46.334 --> 32:48.209
Remove the glass.

32:58.918 --> 33:01.334
He stands there, staring.

33:02.251 --> 33:03.918
It's nothing...

33:04.709 --> 33:06.459
The fish are fine.

33:08.376 --> 33:09.876
They're fine.

33:19.543 --> 33:22.459
I'm really very sorry.

33:38.584 --> 33:43.084
<i>The number you are calling
is not available.</i>

33:44.584 --> 33:46.501
They're not hurt?

33:49.668 --> 33:51.168
AQai", my apologies.

33:51.334 --> 33:55.501
I was listening to you
and got distracted.

33:55.959 --> 33:59.626
Why are they so special?
They seem like normal fish.

34:00.126 --> 34:02.084
They're anything but normal.

34:02.251 --> 34:05.459
We've kept them for a whole year!

34:05.668 --> 34:10.126
And now you throw them back
into Ali's Spring?

34:10.708 --> 34:12.458
Why don't you get it?

34:13.083 --> 34:14.958
You're not paying attention!

34:15.208 --> 34:18.001
We took them from the spring

34:18.168 --> 34:20.793
because we were born 5 years apart.

34:20.958 --> 34:23.208
But both at noon!

34:24.168 --> 34:27.501
We have to throw them at noon
into Ali's Spring

34:27.708 --> 34:30.458
and get two new ones.

34:30.626 --> 34:32.001
Or else we're dead!

34:32.168 --> 34:34.708
Understand? Dead!

34:35.333 --> 34:36.543
God forbid!

34:36.958 --> 34:38.958
At noon or we die.

34:39.833 --> 34:42.293
I have to make a call.

34:53.543 --> 34:56.918
Sorry, you must get out
after the overpass.

34:57.083 --> 34:58.793
I'll hail you another cab.

34:58.959 --> 35:00.001
It'll be fast.

35:00.168 --> 35:02.168
I have to be somewhere.

35:02.334 --> 35:05.751
I must pick up my niece at school.

35:05.918 --> 35:07.793
We beg of you.

35:07.959 --> 35:09.959
We have to be there by noon!

35:10.876 --> 35:15.376
If I don't get there,
she can't walk home alone.

35:18.376 --> 35:21.168
We'll never make it before noon.

35:22.043 --> 35:23.001
What's he doing?

35:23.168 --> 35:24.959
No idea.

35:28.418 --> 35:31.334
What the hell? Such a lousy driver.

35:31.543 --> 35:34.459
No sense of direction. Can't even drive.

35:35.084 --> 35:36.418
What's he doing?

35:36.584 --> 35:37.959
I have no idea.

35:40.251 --> 35:42.459
We won't get there on time.

35:42.626 --> 35:46.251
He knows the way and drives faster.

35:46.668 --> 35:49.418
We'll never make it before noon.

35:51.501 --> 35:53.418
I apologize again.

35:54.168 --> 35:55.876
What a moron.

36:04.376 --> 36:05.959
Thank you very much.

37:44.751 --> 37:47.584
Why did you come in this car for me?

37:47.751 --> 37:50.793
I told everyone
my director uncle was coming!

37:50.959 --> 37:52.876
Now no one will believe me!

37:53.043 --> 37:55.334
Think at least about my reputation.

37:55.501 --> 37:57.709
You always talk about discipline.

37:57.876 --> 38:00.543
I've been hanging around for an hour!

38:01.251 --> 38:04.084
And all you do is keep quiet and stare.

38:04.251 --> 38:06.043
Excuse me, young lady.

38:07.209 --> 38:08.584
And hello to you too!

38:09.209 --> 38:11.668
Hello. Don't change the subject.

38:11.834 --> 38:14.584
What do you tell my parents
if I get kidnapped?

38:14.876 --> 38:16.793
I wouldn't worry about that.

38:17.626 --> 38:20.168
No one could stand all your blabbering.

38:20.376 --> 38:21.126
Hop in.

38:21.334 --> 38:24.709
I have to meet an old neighbor of mine.

38:24.876 --> 38:28.584
You keep promises
to everyone but your niece!

38:28.751 --> 38:32.126
Maybe I should leave you
to your meetings?

38:32.293 --> 38:36.501
I'd find my way
like the girl in your “Mirror” film.

38:37.418 --> 38:39.959
Shall I go or shall I stay?

38:40.418 --> 38:41.918
Your choice.

38:42.084 --> 38:43.168
Meanie!

38:43.334 --> 38:45.418
I was so excited to see you today!

38:45.584 --> 38:48.709
You're late and
now you want to leave me!

38:49.043 --> 38:52.459
I apologized.
You're the one who won't quit!

38:54.209 --> 38:55.751
I was teasing you.

38:55.918 --> 38:59.543
If I wanted to leave,
I wouldn't have waited.

38:59.793 --> 39:02.251
Why was your phone off?

39:02.543 --> 39:03.959
You want the truth?

39:04.918 --> 39:07.168
Are you capable of it, just once?

39:07.334 --> 39:10.209
Uncle, when did I ever lie to you?

39:10.376 --> 39:11.959
Go ahead!

39:13.918 --> 39:17.668
I knew you'd call with 1000 excuses

39:17.834 --> 39:20.209
for not coming.

39:21.918 --> 39:23.751
What if I got worried?

39:23.918 --> 39:24.959
Granny taught me.

39:25.376 --> 39:29.293
When she misses you,
she won't answer the phone.

39:29.459 --> 39:33.376
Thinking she's sick, you go visit her!

39:56.918 --> 39:58.001
How are you?

40:00.418 --> 40:02.709
It's me, Panahi.

40:03.209 --> 40:06.251
I'm really sorry to be so late.

40:08.584 --> 40:11.084
No, I'm on my way.

40:16.918 --> 40:19.209
Where are you right now?

40:24.793 --> 40:28.543
Just give me a few minutes...

40:28.709 --> 40:30.209
Pull over and wait.

40:31.793 --> 40:33.959
I'm on my way.

40:36.251 --> 40:39.709
He thought you called to cancel?

40:39.876 --> 40:41.209
Butt out.

40:43.626 --> 40:45.501
Why did you want to see me?

40:45.668 --> 40:48.043
Not while you're driving.

40:48.209 --> 40:51.793
Why not? We're here together.
Let's talk.

40:51.959 --> 40:54.709
You're a hopeless case!

40:54.876 --> 40:58.834
When you meet
with a smart, educated lady

40:59.001 --> 41:02.543
first you take her for a frappacino,

41:02.709 --> 41:05.168
ice cream
or something of the sort.

41:05.334 --> 41:07.251
Then you talk.

41:15.959 --> 41:17.709
So talk to me,

41:17.876 --> 41:21.501
smart and educated frappacino lady.

41:23.668 --> 41:25.918
Our film teacher

41:26.084 --> 41:30.209
asked us to make a short movie
in a month.

41:30.376 --> 41:34.668
I'll record you
so I remember everything.

41:34.834 --> 41:37.584
You're looking for a story.

41:38.293 --> 41:41.001
As Granny says,
you're sharp as a tack.

41:42.251 --> 41:43.751
By the way,

41:43.918 --> 41:46.959
when Granny came last,
we heard shouting.

41:47.126 --> 41:49.209
It was the neighbors.

41:49.376 --> 41:51.626
They were kicking out some people.

41:51.793 --> 41:54.334
Turns out it was their daughter's suitor.

41:56.501 --> 42:00.834
He threw his daughter's suitor out
during a fight?

42:01.001 --> 42:03.293
The guy she was in love with

42:03.459 --> 42:05.209
was Afghani.

42:05.376 --> 42:06.793
The father didn't know.

42:06.959 --> 42:10.334
When the boy came,
the father found out.

42:10.501 --> 42:12.709
He threw him out of the house.

42:12.876 --> 42:14.626
She was locked inside.

42:14.793 --> 42:16.751
Still, he came back

42:16.918 --> 42:19.751
and waited to meet her at the corner.

42:19.918 --> 42:23.876
Her brothers beat him up several times

42:24.043 --> 42:26.084
but he kept coming back.

42:27.751 --> 42:29.251
And so?

42:29.834 --> 42:32.543
Now, you're not being very sharp!

42:32.709 --> 42:35.043
I filmed the whole thing!

42:36.793 --> 42:39.084
You filmed it all?

42:39.251 --> 42:42.793
The whole thing, from A to Z!

42:45.043 --> 42:48.584
You made your movie.
Why look for a story?

42:49.543 --> 42:50.834
You're something!

42:51.001 --> 42:55.001
As a director,
you know it's un-distributable.

42:55.501 --> 42:56.626
U n -wh at?

42:56.793 --> 42:58.751
Un-distributable!

42:59.168 --> 43:02.876
All filmmakers know that and you don't?

43:03.043 --> 43:03.918
No way!

43:06.709 --> 43:09.334
You intend to show it somewhere?

43:09.626 --> 43:10.668
Of course!

43:10.834 --> 43:14.459
In the Public Education Festival.

43:14.626 --> 43:18.751
Parents are invited to the screening

43:18.918 --> 43:21.834
and the movie they like most
gets money

43:22.001 --> 43:26.126
to make something better
and more distributable!

43:27.376 --> 43:28.918
Very nice!

43:43.543 --> 43:45.209
Mr. Arash.

43:45.376 --> 43:48.168
I just made a U-turn at the overpass.

43:48.959 --> 43:50.626
Where are you exactly?

43:51.168 --> 43:55.709
I just passed by Divist Dastgah.

43:56.543 --> 43:58.334
The other side?

44:00.293 --> 44:01.626
At the corner.

44:02.376 --> 44:05.251
A whitish-beige car?

44:05.418 --> 44:07.918
I see you. Just a sec.

45:22.084 --> 45:24.251
It's been ages since you last met.

45:25.626 --> 45:27.584
6 or <i>7</i> years.

45:28.793 --> 45:30.876
Can I tell you the truth?

45:31.043 --> 45:33.626
He doesn't look like your kind of friend.

45:36.251 --> 45:38.793
His father was
a good friend of Grandpa's.

45:40.251 --> 45:42.418
He's from our old neighborhood.

45:50.126 --> 45:51.376
Come on in.

45:55.168 --> 45:56.751
The famous Miss Hana!

45:56.918 --> 45:59.001
How are you?

45:59.168 --> 45:59.876
Fine thanks.

46:00.043 --> 46:02.543
Your uncle has become impossible to see.

46:03.584 --> 46:06.376
He's forgotten his old neighbor.

46:07.126 --> 46:08.793
He never calls

46:09.376 --> 46:11.876
or answers my calls either.

46:13.251 --> 46:14.626
You like fruit juice?

46:16.209 --> 46:18.501
Orange juice? Ice cream pie?

46:18.668 --> 46:19.626
No, thanks.

46:19.793 --> 46:22.959
Just like her uncle, always "No thanks"!

46:24.709 --> 46:27.251
- Frappacino?
- Love it!

46:27.418 --> 46:29.418
Come on, let's go.

46:38.501 --> 46:43.376
Sorry I didn't ask you into my car.
There's someone.

46:43.543 --> 46:45.501
I want this to be kept secret.

46:45.668 --> 46:48.584
I'll leave you a minute to look at it.

47:05.293 --> 47:06.418
What is it?

47:08.043 --> 47:10.251
Have a look. You'll see.

47:38.501 --> 47:40.543
Your friend is suspicious.

47:40.709 --> 47:43.376
He said to leave my camera here.

47:43.543 --> 47:45.626
He may want to kidnap me!

48:11.543 --> 48:13.334
Want some CDs?

48:13.501 --> 48:17.293
I have all the new stuff.

48:17.459 --> 48:19.834
Andy, Shahriyar, Shamaeezadeh...

48:31.334 --> 48:33.876
Local and diaspora artists.
Great stuff.

48:34.584 --> 48:35.793
How much?

48:35.959 --> 48:36.918
Just this one.

48:37.084 --> 48:38.584
2 tomans.

48:39.376 --> 48:41.584
There are two CDs.

49:33.501 --> 49:34.626
Did you see it?

49:35.043 --> 49:35.876
Were you hurt?

49:36.918 --> 49:38.209
Nothing too serious.

49:38.751 --> 49:40.293
When did it happen?

49:41.543 --> 49:43.834
Last month.

49:44.001 --> 49:46.584
The security camera had just been put in.

49:47.251 --> 49:49.334
Can I see it again?

49:49.876 --> 49:52.793
I'll show you from another angle.

49:57.168 --> 49:59.126
This is the woman.

50:00.418 --> 50:02.168
This is the man.

50:02.334 --> 50:04.209
He hit me with a club.

50:04.376 --> 50:06.209
They're husband and wife.

50:08.918 --> 50:10.209
Married?

50:12.543 --> 50:16.459
When he threw me against the wall,

50:17.001 --> 50:19.668
his bandana slipped to the side.

50:20.501 --> 50:23.084
I saw his eyes. I thought I knew him.

50:27.084 --> 50:28.876
That's when I felt it.

50:30.626 --> 50:31.959
What did you do?

50:33.918 --> 50:35.501
What could I do?

50:36.293 --> 50:39.751
Did you do anything, file a complaint?

50:41.793 --> 50:42.793
Why not?

50:43.668 --> 50:44.959
It was just after...

50:45.751 --> 50:49.584
the news reports
about those criminals who got hanged.

50:49.959 --> 50:53.959
I didn't have the heart to turn them in.

50:54.918 --> 50:56.626
That was different.

50:56.793 --> 51:00.876
They put the film on the news
to make a statement.

51:01.043 --> 51:03.168
It's a different story.

51:04.293 --> 51:06.043
It wasn't just that.

51:06.209 --> 51:07.876
I recognized them.

51:09.293 --> 51:11.168
The man and the woman.

51:11.334 --> 51:12.876
I know them.

51:16.251 --> 51:17.501
Since then,

51:20.834 --> 51:22.251
I found out

51:22.418 --> 51:24.918
they were under financial pressure.

51:25.084 --> 51:27.376
I saw how the money they stole

51:28.001 --> 51:30.501
helped solve their problems.

51:30.668 --> 51:33.001
I just couldn't have them arrested.

51:33.626 --> 51:35.126
I just couldn't.

51:35.626 --> 51:37.709
When I see them, I get on edge.

51:37.876 --> 51:40.418
It makes me choke.

51:41.293 --> 51:45.209
I thought talking to you
might ease the pain.

51:46.334 --> 51:48.876
I know you can't make movies anymore.

51:49.043 --> 51:51.209
Perhaps one day

51:51.376 --> 51:54.584
another director can use it.

51:58.126 --> 51:59.376
Here you are.

52:01.168 --> 52:02.751
Anything else?

52:12.084 --> 52:13.084
It's him.

52:14.126 --> 52:14.876
Who?

52:15.043 --> 52:15.668
The thief.

52:18.459 --> 52:20.209
You should have told me.

52:21.001 --> 52:23.626
I really wanted to see his face.

52:24.543 --> 52:25.751
What for?

52:26.751 --> 52:30.834
I wanted to see
what a thief looks like.

52:32.751 --> 52:34.959
Like me, like you,

52:35.668 --> 52:38.459
like anyone around us.

52:51.876 --> 52:53.584
How are you doing now?

52:54.918 --> 52:56.043
Better.

52:57.376 --> 52:58.668
Getting better.

53:02.876 --> 53:04.543
Still in the neighborhood?

53:04.709 --> 53:06.668
Sure. I'm still there.

53:07.418 --> 53:09.168
Faithful to our roots.

53:12.376 --> 53:14.293
I came once to visit.

53:16.543 --> 53:19.168
I didn't recognize our street.

53:20.376 --> 53:23.376
Everything had changed.
Buildings razed.

53:23.543 --> 53:25.751
The people changed too.

53:25.959 --> 53:31.001
You rarely recognize anyone you know.

53:31.501 --> 53:33.251
Everything's different.

53:43.001 --> 53:44.459
Nice seeing you, Jafar.

53:44.626 --> 53:45.501
Same here.

53:45.668 --> 53:47.168
Thank you for your time.

53:47.334 --> 53:48.418
You're welcome.

53:50.709 --> 53:51.793
Anything I can do?

53:52.543 --> 53:53.584
I'm fine.

53:54.251 --> 53:56.543
Just tell Hana to come back.

54:01.459 --> 54:03.168
Thanks, man!

54:05.168 --> 54:06.459
Sorry I can't help.

54:07.584 --> 54:08.709
Good bye.

54:53.876 --> 54:58.126
What nice people,
especially the orange juice guy!

55:02.376 --> 55:03.376
Tell me,

55:03.543 --> 55:05.126
what did he look like?

55:05.668 --> 55:06.959
What do you mean?

55:07.126 --> 55:09.543
Normal. Like everybody else.

55:17.126 --> 55:20.001
So you want to make
a distributable movie?

55:20.293 --> 55:25.043
This is what I was reading
when your phone rang.

55:39.418 --> 55:40.626
Here we go.

55:41.751 --> 55:44.501
Teacher said a distributable movie...

55:44.668 --> 55:46.793
You filming or reading?

55:46.959 --> 55:49.168
First, make a choice.

55:54.709 --> 55:56.834
She said we have to respect

55:57.001 --> 56:00.126
the following rules
to make a distributable movie.

56:01.751 --> 56:04.959
Respect for the Islamic headscarf,

56:05.334 --> 56:07.418
no contact between men and women,

56:07.584 --> 56:09.626
avoid sordid realism,

56:09.793 --> 56:11.418
avoid violence,

56:11.668 --> 56:15.668
avoid the use of a tie
for good guys.

56:16.084 --> 56:20.584
Avoid the use of Iranian names
for good guys.

56:20.751 --> 56:25.668
Instead use the sacred names
of the Islamic saints.

56:28.084 --> 56:31.001
Uncle, why won't you listen to me?

56:32.084 --> 56:35.209
I am. I was thinking...

56:36.209 --> 56:37.418
About what?

56:39.376 --> 56:41.084
I was just thinking

56:41.251 --> 56:43.126
how would we manage

56:43.626 --> 56:46.209
with the old neighbor you just met.

56:47.751 --> 56:49.584
Is he a good guy or a bad guy?

56:50.418 --> 56:52.668
He has an Iranian name and a tie.

56:52.834 --> 56:55.001
That was real life.

56:55.168 --> 56:57.793
These rules apply to movies!

57:00.376 --> 57:04.959
If we want him as a good guy in a movie,
what do we do?

57:06.126 --> 57:08.626
We change him from head to toe!

57:09.168 --> 57:11.459
You mean
make a new person from scratch?

57:11.668 --> 57:14.543
Change his name into an Islamic one,

57:14.709 --> 57:16.793
take off his tie...

57:17.043 --> 57:20.459
He had no beard
but we can give him a small one.

57:23.793 --> 57:25.584
Should I continue?

57:25.876 --> 57:27.084
Go on.

57:27.251 --> 57:30.959
Avoid discussing political
and economical issues...

57:31.126 --> 57:32.084
That's enough.

57:32.501 --> 57:35.876
My teacher said other things too.

57:36.043 --> 57:38.834
She said we should use our judgment.

57:39.001 --> 57:43.543
If we notice anything problematical,

57:44.209 --> 57:46.584
it's up to us to censure it.

57:47.084 --> 57:48.959
She said: "You know better".

57:59.209 --> 58:01.293
My dear uncle...

58:18.626 --> 58:19.793
Listen.

58:19.959 --> 58:21.334
Stay put.

58:22.668 --> 58:23.751
I'll be a minute.

58:23.918 --> 58:25.126
Going to the bathroom?

58:25.293 --> 58:26.668
Butt out.

58:26.834 --> 58:27.793
Don't get out.

58:27.959 --> 58:29.834
And don't open the door.

58:30.001 --> 58:31.543
And don't talk to strangers.

58:31.709 --> 58:32.293
What?

58:32.459 --> 58:35.501
Just kidding! Can't you take a joke?

01:00:23.418 --> 01:00:24.668
You, boy!

01:00:26.918 --> 01:00:28.084
Hey you!

01:00:28.418 --> 01:00:29.501
Come here!

01:00:29.959 --> 01:00:31.126
Yeah, you!

01:00:36.209 --> 01:00:37.209
No camera!

01:00:37.376 --> 01:00:38.168
Come here!

01:00:40.709 --> 01:00:41.793
No camera.

01:00:43.251 --> 01:00:46.251
I saw you take that, over there.

01:00:46.418 --> 01:00:47.126
What?

01:00:47.293 --> 01:00:48.376
The money!

01:00:48.876 --> 01:00:50.459
No money in the garbage.

01:00:50.626 --> 01:00:53.376
The money that fell
from the groom's pocket!

01:00:53.543 --> 01:00:56.501
The groom's pocket?
I didn't see anything.

01:00:56.668 --> 01:00:59.293
I saw it myself
and I got it on tape!

01:00:59.459 --> 01:01:02.876
I couldn't care less.
It fell on the ground.

01:01:03.459 --> 01:01:05.584
I found it. Now it's mine.

01:01:05.751 --> 01:01:07.543
I saw the groom drop it.

01:01:07.709 --> 01:01:10.126
My film teacher told us

01:01:10.293 --> 01:01:13.459
we have a month to make
a distributable movie.

01:01:13.626 --> 01:01:17.293
You took the money
and made it un-distributable!

01:01:17.459 --> 01:01:19.876
Go give it back to the groom.

01:01:20.209 --> 01:01:23.543
In exchange I'll give you 5 tomans.

01:01:23.709 --> 01:01:25.626
50 for 5?

01:01:25.793 --> 01:01:27.584
No one's crazy enough to do that.

01:01:27.834 --> 01:01:29.709
Don't worry about them.

01:01:29.876 --> 01:01:33.376
Her makeup cost a fortune.
They can afford it.

01:01:33.918 --> 01:01:36.501
I don't care about their money.

01:01:36.668 --> 01:01:38.668
I care only about my movie.

01:01:38.834 --> 01:01:42.459
Please, put the money back.
You're ruining my movie.

01:01:42.626 --> 01:01:45.834
Put it back
and you'll become my film's hero.

01:01:46.001 --> 01:01:48.834
I want to show
sacrifice and selflessness!

01:01:49.001 --> 01:01:50.918
I'm begging you, please.

01:01:51.084 --> 01:01:53.376
What the fuck
is sacrifice or selflessness?

01:01:53.543 --> 01:01:58.209
I don't want to be a hero,
just give my dad the money.

01:01:58.376 --> 01:02:00.126
I'm begging you, please.

01:02:00.293 --> 01:02:02.626
Do it for your mother's sake.

01:02:02.793 --> 01:02:04.334
I have no mother.

01:02:04.501 --> 01:02:06.459
You may not have a mother,

01:02:06.626 --> 01:02:09.043
but you used to love your mother.

01:02:09.209 --> 01:02:12.126
Do it just to make your mother happy.

01:02:12.293 --> 01:02:15.293
Please, just go put the money back.

01:02:20.793 --> 01:02:21.876
You do it.

01:02:22.626 --> 01:02:24.668
No, you have to do it.

01:02:24.834 --> 01:02:27.668
You do it, I'll record it.

01:02:28.001 --> 01:02:30.209
For God's sake, please.

01:02:30.959 --> 01:02:32.126
Please...

01:02:48.709 --> 01:02:50.876
You're so stupid!

01:03:06.584 --> 01:03:09.168
Hurry, they're gonna leave.

01:03:13.626 --> 01:03:15.376
Give it to him!

01:03:24.501 --> 01:03:26.168
Hurry up!

01:03:33.043 --> 01:03:34.584
Give it back!

01:04:14.584 --> 01:04:16.459
Why are you so upset?

01:04:18.626 --> 01:04:20.084
It's nothing.

01:04:49.376 --> 01:04:50.543
Want to talk?

01:04:51.793 --> 01:04:54.584
Don't ask. I don't want to elaborate.

01:04:56.459 --> 01:04:58.751
Whatever you say, young lady!

01:06:17.543 --> 01:06:18.751
Hear that too?

01:06:18.918 --> 01:06:20.209
Hear what?

01:06:21.043 --> 01:06:23.418
Do you hear that out there?

01:06:24.543 --> 01:06:25.709
I was concentrating.

01:06:25.876 --> 01:06:28.834
I didn't hear or see a thing.

01:06:35.209 --> 01:06:36.459
Look, she's there!

01:06:36.751 --> 01:06:37.959
Who?

01:06:38.709 --> 01:06:40.168
The flower lady.

01:06:40.334 --> 01:06:41.376
Where?

01:06:41.543 --> 01:06:42.876
Don't you see?

01:06:43.043 --> 01:06:47.001
The one who brings roses
when she comes to see you.

01:06:57.418 --> 01:06:59.126
Hello there...

01:07:01.209 --> 01:07:03.334
Jafar Panahi, our very own!

01:07:03.501 --> 01:07:05.043
Where are you going?

01:07:05.459 --> 01:07:06.876
I'll call you later.

01:07:07.918 --> 01:07:09.751
Where to? I'll take you.

01:07:09.918 --> 01:07:11.043
Sit up front.

01:07:14.251 --> 01:07:16.459
But you have a little passenger!

01:07:18.418 --> 01:07:19.501
Thanks,honey.

01:07:24.001 --> 01:07:25.418
How are you?

01:07:26.668 --> 01:07:29.293
Fine, fine, very good!

01:07:31.209 --> 01:07:32.501
For you, sweetheart!

01:07:32.668 --> 01:07:34.834
Thank you very much.

01:07:36.834 --> 01:07:39.084
How are you doing?

01:07:39.751 --> 01:07:40.834
What's up?

01:07:41.126 --> 01:07:43.084
Here, of all places?

01:07:43.251 --> 01:07:43.959
Where to?

01:07:44.126 --> 01:07:44.876
Cabbie now?

01:07:45.084 --> 01:07:47.126
Back in the driver's seat?

01:07:50.793 --> 01:07:53.126
Looking for someone?

01:07:53.626 --> 01:07:56.418
I heard a voice
right before I saw you.

01:07:57.709 --> 01:08:00.376
I thought
I recognized my interrogator.

01:08:01.293 --> 01:08:04.334
Many of my clients say the same thing.

01:08:06.043 --> 01:08:09.334
They want to identify people
from their voices.

01:08:10.918 --> 01:08:13.001
Advantage of blindfolds.

01:08:14.209 --> 01:08:17.001
Always trying to pin down the voice.

01:08:17.334 --> 01:08:18.084
Where to?

01:08:18.417 --> 01:08:19.626
Paradise!

01:08:19.834 --> 01:08:20.834
Paradise.

01:08:21.001 --> 01:08:23.584
There's Paradise Street...

01:08:25.459 --> 01:08:27.251
Oh! That paradise?

01:08:28.292 --> 01:08:29.292
That paradise.

01:08:29.876 --> 01:08:34.251
Those gentlemen have
exclusive rights to that Paradise.

01:08:35.042 --> 01:08:37.084
Seriously where to?

01:08:37.334 --> 01:08:39.751
I'm going towards Vanak.

01:08:40.376 --> 01:08:41.751
Is it convenient?

01:08:41.917 --> 01:08:43.792
I don't want to be a bother.

01:08:43.959 --> 01:08:45.542
Let me guess.

01:08:48.001 --> 01:08:52.667
Either you're visiting
a prisoner who just got out

01:08:52.834 --> 01:08:55.042
or the family of someone just in.

01:08:55.209 --> 01:08:56.792
I wish it were good news.

01:08:56.959 --> 01:08:59.667
Ghonche Ghavami is now in prison.

01:09:00.876 --> 01:09:03.001
The girl from the stadium?

01:09:03.209 --> 01:09:04.959
Just like in your movie.

01:09:05.126 --> 01:09:06.751
"Offside".

01:09:08.042 --> 01:09:11.459
Ghoncheh Ghavami
attended a volleyball game.

01:09:12.751 --> 01:09:15.584
There were other women.

01:09:16.501 --> 01:09:17.459
All arrested.

01:09:17.626 --> 01:09:21.542
Everyone was freed but her.
It's been 108 days.

01:09:22.251 --> 01:09:24.126
Did she get to see the game?

01:09:24.334 --> 01:09:27.417
No, they were arrested
outside the stadium.

01:09:29.959 --> 01:09:34.542
She's been on a hunger strike
for 10 days.

01:09:34.709 --> 01:09:36.501
Her mother visited her.

01:09:36.667 --> 01:09:40.876
She tried to persuade her
to break her strike.

01:09:41.042 --> 01:09:42.626
We sent messages too,

01:09:42.792 --> 01:09:46.334
saying you're entitled
to do what you're doing.

01:09:46.501 --> 01:09:49.792
You and I have been
on hunger strikes ourselves.

01:09:49.959 --> 01:09:53.209
It's always our very last resort.

01:09:55.376 --> 01:09:57.209
She's doing the same thing.

01:09:57.376 --> 01:10:01.543
The mother goes with food
to convince her to eat.

01:10:02.668 --> 01:10:06.001
They put the mother
in a room with cameras:

01:10:06.168 --> 01:10:08.459
"Come here, convince Ghoncheh."

01:10:08.959 --> 01:10:10.709
Their typical filmed interview.

01:10:10.876 --> 01:10:12.251
Obviously.

01:10:12.418 --> 01:10:14.334
"Tell the camera

01:10:14.501 --> 01:10:16.543
"she was never on strike."

01:10:17.209 --> 01:10:20.584
The mother goes totally berserk,
storms out,

01:10:20.751 --> 01:10:23.584
tells them to keep their visiting hours.

01:10:23.751 --> 01:10:25.918
She takes the food and leaves.

01:10:26.418 --> 01:10:30.709
They give Ghonche a piece of paper
and say to write the same thing:

01:10:31.293 --> 01:10:34.126
"I never went on hunger strike".

01:10:34.293 --> 01:10:38.668
She refuses, rips it up
and says: "You can keep your visits!"

01:10:40.543 --> 01:10:42.209
So that's the story.

01:10:42.376 --> 01:10:44.084
I'm going to visit them now.

01:10:44.251 --> 01:10:47.668
We'll see what we can do for her.

01:10:47.834 --> 01:10:51.251
As of yesterday,
she's stopped drinking water.

01:10:52.084 --> 01:10:55.043
We'll see what our options are.

01:10:56.751 --> 01:10:57.709
What can we do?

01:10:57.876 --> 01:10:58.751
I see.

01:11:00.376 --> 01:11:02.251
How is your husband?

01:11:02.418 --> 01:11:05.293
He's fine, busy working.

01:11:05.959 --> 01:11:07.668
Not banned from work?

01:11:07.834 --> 01:11:08.918
No.

01:11:09.668 --> 01:11:13.376
I heard you got a 3-year suspension?

01:11:13.543 --> 01:11:15.168
No more law practice?

01:11:16.418 --> 01:11:20.626
I heard the bar association
voted to suspend me.

01:11:21.459 --> 01:11:22.709
From practicing law.

01:11:22.876 --> 01:11:26.334
I haven't received any legal notice yet.

01:11:26.793 --> 01:11:28.584
For now... nothing.

01:11:29.418 --> 01:11:31.501
It's not official until I get one.

01:11:31.668 --> 01:11:33.918
The bar association did this?

01:11:35.876 --> 01:11:36.626
I don't know.

01:11:36.793 --> 01:11:39.668
Don't they defend lawyers' rights?

01:11:40.043 --> 01:11:45.043
As if the Directors Guild
forbade you to make movies.

01:11:47.001 --> 01:11:48.501
How would it feel?

01:11:49.876 --> 01:11:52.876
It's wet back here.
Someone left a purse.

01:11:53.043 --> 01:11:54.293
A purse? Show me.

01:11:54.459 --> 01:11:55.209
Here.

01:11:58.043 --> 01:12:00.876
See if there's an address or something.

01:12:01.043 --> 01:12:04.043
That's wrong. It's not mine.

01:12:04.209 --> 01:12:06.126
It's totally impolite.

01:12:06.293 --> 01:12:09.251
Sorry I asked, young lady!

01:12:09.668 --> 01:12:13.668
This purse doesn't belong
to someone my age.

01:12:15.001 --> 01:12:17.626
Not even for my mother's age.

01:12:17.793 --> 01:12:20.834
It belongs to an old lady.

01:12:21.084 --> 01:12:22.626
Like Granny?

01:12:22.793 --> 01:12:24.043
Exactly!

01:12:24.668 --> 01:12:26.084
Maybe it was...

01:12:26.251 --> 01:12:29.709
those women who went to Ali's Spring.

01:12:30.126 --> 01:12:32.043
My only elderly passengers.

01:12:32.209 --> 01:12:33.126
Ali's Spring...

01:12:33.709 --> 01:12:36.376
You must find them.
You found your way.

01:12:36.543 --> 01:12:39.001
First I'll drop you off.

01:12:39.168 --> 01:12:41.251
Let me off here.

01:12:41.876 --> 01:12:43.793
Take the Nawab highway.

01:12:46.084 --> 01:12:46.918
Not far.

01:12:47.084 --> 01:12:48.918
Totally opposite directions.

01:12:49.251 --> 01:12:52.043
Do your thing. It's more important.

01:12:52.209 --> 01:12:55.043
This is for the people of cinema.

01:12:55.209 --> 01:12:59.834
Because the people of cinema
can be relied on.

01:13:00.209 --> 01:13:01.293
Just like you.

01:13:03.584 --> 01:13:04.834
I put it there.

01:13:05.001 --> 01:13:07.459
Don't think I don't see
what you're up to.

01:13:08.126 --> 01:13:10.376
You know, Jafar,

01:13:10.543 --> 01:13:12.751
sometimes they do it on purpose

01:13:12.959 --> 01:13:16.459
so we know they're watching us.

01:13:16.626 --> 01:13:18.876
Such obvious tactics.

01:13:19.043 --> 01:13:21.334
First they mount a political case.

01:13:21.501 --> 01:13:24.793
You're an agent for Mossad, CIA, Ml5!

01:13:25.209 --> 01:13:28.876
They beef it up
with a morality charge.

01:13:30.584 --> 01:13:32.709
They make your life hell.

01:13:33.334 --> 01:13:36.126
When you finally get released,

01:13:36.334 --> 01:13:38.751
the outside world
becomes a bigger cell.

01:13:39.376 --> 01:13:42.709
They make your best friends
your worst enemies!

01:13:44.209 --> 01:13:47.543
Either you have to escape the country

01:13:48.168 --> 01:13:51.918
or start hoping to go back to jail.

01:13:52.626 --> 01:13:55.876
In my opinion... just let it go.

01:13:57.334 --> 01:13:58.293
That's it.

01:13:59.334 --> 01:14:02.293
Better to remove my words
from your movie.

01:14:02.459 --> 01:14:05.209
You'll be accused of sordid realism.

01:14:05.376 --> 01:14:07.793
They'll bother you even more.

01:14:10.584 --> 01:14:12.418
It's green. Hurry.

01:14:12.584 --> 01:14:14.918
Thanks, it was a pleasure.

01:14:15.793 --> 01:14:17.501
Hurry up!

01:14:21.126 --> 01:14:22.918
Get in the car.

01:14:33.543 --> 01:14:36.251
Uncle, isn't she lovely?

01:14:36.543 --> 01:14:38.043
The flower lady?

01:14:39.168 --> 01:14:43.418
What exactly is "sordid realism"?

01:14:44.876 --> 01:14:47.918
Wasn't it in your instructions?

01:14:48.084 --> 01:14:51.709
Teacher even explained what it meant.

01:14:51.876 --> 01:14:53.751
It didn't get it.

01:14:53.918 --> 01:14:55.668
Bad explainer!

01:14:55.834 --> 01:14:58.918
She said show what's real,
but not real real.

01:14:59.084 --> 01:15:03.126
Then she said
if reality is dark and unpleasant,

01:15:03.293 --> 01:15:05.418
not to show it.

01:15:05.584 --> 01:15:08.751
Personally, I don't get the difference.

01:15:08.918 --> 01:15:12.251
Real, unreal...
It's honestly beyond me.

01:15:12.418 --> 01:15:14.209
Can't get it in my head.

01:15:15.334 --> 01:15:19.501
Like the things
flower lady just said

01:15:21.834 --> 01:15:24.209
shouldn't be shown or spoken of.

01:15:24.543 --> 01:15:28.584
Nonsense.
Everything she said was real.

01:15:29.626 --> 01:15:33.209
There are realities
they don't want shown.

01:15:33.376 --> 01:15:37.834
They don't want to show it
but they do it themselves.

01:15:38.001 --> 01:15:40.709
Whatever... I don't get it.

01:15:43.918 --> 01:15:45.376
The flower is so pretty.

01:17:26.043 --> 01:17:27.668
Let's see if they're here.

01:18:07.168 --> 01:18:08.293
They're here.

01:18:09.501 --> 01:18:10.751
Where's the purse?

01:18:10.918 --> 01:18:12.584
In my backpack.

01:20:24.543 --> 01:20:25.418
Hwg Q Om. Ins'

01:20:25.584 --> 01:20:26.626
No memory stick.

01:20:26.793 --> 01:20:28.501
We'll come back.

01:20:34.584 --> 01:20:38.959
TAXI

01:20:42.001 --> 01:20:47.793
<i>A film by Jafar Panahi</i>

01:20:50.501 --> 01:20:52.918
<i>The Ministry of Islamic Guidance</i>

01:20:53.084 --> 01:20:56.293
<i>approves the credits
of distributable films.</i>

01:20:56.459 --> 01:20:58.293
<i>Despite my heartfelt wish,</i>

01:20:58.459 --> 01:21:00.834
<i>this film has no credits.</i>

01:21:01.001 --> 01:21:03.793
<i>I am indebted
to everyone who helped us.</i>

01:21:03.959 --> 01:21:06.251
<i>This film would not exist
without their support.</i>
