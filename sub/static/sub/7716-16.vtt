00:01.503 --> 00:02.504
Hey, Angela,

00:02.587 --> 00:03.797
you wanna see
a picture of Philip

00:03.922 --> 00:05.215
wearing those little
booties you got us?

00:06.007 --> 00:07.217
So cute.

00:08.093 --> 00:10.595
Hey, you guys wanna see a picture
of Gerald wearing galoshes?

00:10.970 --> 00:13.515
He refused to go out in the
rain until I bought these.

00:13.598 --> 00:15.934
Now, going out in the rain
is all he wants to do.

00:17.769 --> 00:20.397
Oscar thinks having a dog
is just like having a baby.

00:20.480 --> 00:21.856
News flash,
if you didn't carry

00:21.981 --> 00:23.400
it around in your
belly for nine months,

00:23.483 --> 00:24.526
it isn't your kid.

00:24.609 --> 00:25.985
Exactly.

00:26.528 --> 00:27.862
Unless you adopted,
of course.

00:27.987 --> 00:29.447
That is where we disagree.

00:30.407 --> 00:32.117
Hey, are your little
dudes crawling yet?

00:32.200 --> 00:35.036
No. Three-month-old
humans don't do that.

00:36.287 --> 00:37.622
My Philip is crawling.

00:39.374 --> 00:41.501
Angela is such a liar!

00:41.584 --> 00:42.836
It's maddening!

00:44.087 --> 00:46.047
Exactly, that's just
like crate training.

00:46.131 --> 00:48.133
All night long.
All night long.

00:48.758 --> 00:49.801
Well, count yourself lucky.

00:50.009 --> 00:51.177
Wait until you have two.

00:51.261 --> 00:54.097
That's two sleep schedules,
two naps that don't coincide.

00:54.180 --> 00:56.224
I mean,
you'll never sleep again.

00:56.641 --> 00:58.226
No one said
you must have two.

00:58.351 --> 00:59.894
Like her genes
are so important.

00:59.978 --> 01:02.647
The world just needs more Pam-Jim DNA.
Thank you, no.

01:02.731 --> 01:04.065
No, thank you.

01:07.360 --> 01:09.738
Check this out. My brother
just got a new sailboat.

01:09.821 --> 01:13.241
He has no idea what he
just got himself into.

01:13.658 --> 01:15.618
There's nothing harder
than taking care of a boat.

01:16.327 --> 01:17.328
Am I right?

01:17.662 --> 01:18.830
Unbelievable!
Unbelievable!

01:18.913 --> 01:20.957
Unbelievable!

01:32.510 --> 01:35.388
It is the end of the day.
It is the end of the week.

01:35.472 --> 01:39.100
We managed to fill
40 hours, somehow.

01:39.184 --> 01:40.310
That's not bad, is it?

01:40.810 --> 01:42.479
That's great.
Pretty good.

01:42.562 --> 01:45.523
Well, thank you,
this is very helpful feedback.

01:45.607 --> 01:47.859
Dwight, I am still not
ready to name the V.P.

01:48.193 --> 01:49.611
That's not what
I was gonna ask.

01:49.694 --> 01:51.821
Gosh, you jump to conclusions!

01:52.155 --> 01:54.449
Come on, I know. You've got
so much on your plate,

01:54.532 --> 01:55.909
it's right now you're like,

01:55.992 --> 01:59.120
"Oh, what's more important, Dwight's
question, figure out who's the V.P.

01:59.204 --> 02:01.372
"Dwight. V.P. Dwight. V.P."

02:01.831 --> 02:03.833
Dwight. V.P. Dwight. V.P.

02:03.917 --> 02:05.710
I can't be hypnotized, Dwight.

02:05.794 --> 02:07.629
I tried it.
I ended up smoking more.

02:07.712 --> 02:10.465
Can we at least eliminate those
that are not in the running?

02:10.548 --> 02:13.343
Free them up to focus
more completely on the menial.

02:13.510 --> 02:15.595
Like stacking
and sorting, or...

02:16.054 --> 02:17.180
Catching butterflies?

02:17.263 --> 02:18.890
That's a hobby.
Unless it's for food.

02:18.973 --> 02:20.725
Theater.
A waste of time.

02:21.059 --> 02:22.060
Dragging?

02:22.227 --> 02:23.269
That's just a verb.

02:23.353 --> 02:24.354
Dragging sticks.

02:24.437 --> 02:25.522
Yes. Nice. Perfect.

02:25.605 --> 02:26.981
Dragging sticks...

02:27.065 --> 02:29.275
All right, I'm gonna eliminate
three people right now.

02:29.359 --> 02:31.611
Okay? Just. You three. No.

02:32.070 --> 02:34.364
Not good enough.

02:36.282 --> 02:39.911
English people's main use today
is judging American talent.

02:40.662 --> 02:42.956
"You're crap.
You're wonderful."

02:43.373 --> 02:45.500
They're mean,
but they're incisive.

02:46.084 --> 02:48.545
Everyone meet in
the hotel bar at 7:00.

02:48.628 --> 02:50.588
I'm not allowed to
say it's mandatory.

02:50.713 --> 02:52.674
So let's just
call it compulsory.

02:53.341 --> 02:55.051
I'll be there at 6:00.

02:55.134 --> 02:57.345
Ugh. We're gonna have one of
those crazy nights, aren't we?

02:57.428 --> 02:58.763
Maybe we'll see
the real Talla-nasty

02:58.888 --> 03:00.181
we've been
hearing so much about.

03:00.265 --> 03:01.766
Talla-nasty. Very clever.

03:01.933 --> 03:03.309
Thank you.
Wait, wait.

03:03.393 --> 03:05.562
You think she
invented "Talla-nasty"?

03:06.104 --> 03:07.897
No,no,no,no.

03:09.691 --> 03:12.944
Cathy? It's been
great, fun, normal.

03:13.027 --> 03:15.613
I thought I was gonna be hanging
out with Stanley on this trip,

03:15.697 --> 03:17.949
but he's turned out
to be kind of a loose cannon.

03:18.032 --> 03:19.784
My friend and I
are new here in Tallahassee.

03:19.868 --> 03:21.744
Would you like
to get a cocktail?

03:21.828 --> 03:25.623
Maybe go out for a little dancing?
Beautiful day, no?

03:26.624 --> 03:29.002
Okay, everybody.
5:00. Work day's over.

03:29.085 --> 03:32.922
Put your pencils down,
and bring 'em back up!

03:33.006 --> 03:36.009
Because now, the late
night work jam begins!

03:36.092 --> 03:37.927
Yes! The conference
room is set up.

03:38.011 --> 03:40.471
I've got pens, I've got paper,
I've got a whiteboard!

03:40.555 --> 03:41.848
We are good to go.

03:42.015 --> 03:43.016
Say what?

03:43.099 --> 03:44.434
We are good to go!

03:44.517 --> 03:46.477
Say what?
Good to go!

03:46.644 --> 03:47.979
Stop it!
Andy!

03:48.438 --> 03:50.106
Tonight, we're staying late
to service the accounts

03:50.189 --> 03:51.399
of the people who
went on the Florida trip.

03:51.482 --> 03:52.859
Yes, of course
we could have just

03:52.984 --> 03:54.360
been doing this
the whole time,

03:54.444 --> 03:56.613
but someone dropped the ball.

03:57.488 --> 03:59.949
Ball droppings
can be beautiful.

04:00.450 --> 04:04.203
For example, when it turns an awkward
soprano into a rich, full tenor.

04:05.747 --> 04:08.499
Jason Bourne
would kick Bond's ass.

04:08.583 --> 04:11.586
Jason Bourne has
no support staff,

04:11.669 --> 04:13.254
his own government's
out to get him.

04:13.338 --> 04:14.756
Genghis Khan could
take 'em both down,

04:14.881 --> 04:16.341
'cause he's not
afraid to kill children.

04:18.343 --> 04:20.178
What? It's true.

04:20.261 --> 04:22.722
He would eviscerate
babies and hang them

04:22.805 --> 04:24.432
from poles
outside of the villages.

04:25.516 --> 04:28.061
Okay, drinking game. The count
of three, take three sips.

04:28.144 --> 04:31.439
That's a stupid game. I got a
great drinking game. Okay?

04:31.522 --> 04:32.941
Everyone, empty your pockets.

04:33.024 --> 04:35.193
Whoever has
the most seeds is the king,

04:35.276 --> 04:38.154
whoever has the least buttons
is the hunchback.

04:38.237 --> 04:39.781
What happens if
you're the hunchback?

04:39.864 --> 04:41.074
Oh, you get kicked.

04:41.157 --> 04:42.325
How many buttons do you have?

04:42.408 --> 04:43.993
Forty. Always.

04:44.077 --> 04:45.703
Can I see?
Sure.

04:46.079 --> 04:47.705
So I get to kick you now.

04:47.789 --> 04:49.874
No, they're not transferable just
'cause I handed them to you.

04:49.958 --> 04:51.042
Well, that's howl
played it in college.

04:51.167 --> 04:52.210
College rules.

04:53.670 --> 04:56.839
And he lost at
his own lame game.

04:57.006 --> 04:59.050
Ooh! Double meaning.

04:59.384 --> 05:02.136
The game was lame, and now
he's lame from the kick.

05:02.220 --> 05:04.055
Quick wit.
Thank you.

05:05.306 --> 05:08.059
I will have a glass of your
oakiest chardonnay, please.

05:08.518 --> 05:11.813
And I will have a waffle.
With your maple-iest syrup.

05:12.397 --> 05:13.982
Sorry, no waffles.

05:14.482 --> 05:17.735
Okay, just forget it then.
Forget it. Forget it?

05:18.569 --> 05:19.570
Waffle?

05:19.821 --> 05:21.906
A hotel waffle.
I know what I wanna eat.

05:21.990 --> 05:23.533
Is that crazy?
No.

05:24.325 --> 05:25.576
I'm moving down here,
you know.

05:26.911 --> 05:28.830
Oh. No, I didn't know.

05:28.913 --> 05:31.332
I'm young and I can.

05:31.416 --> 05:33.584
And if I can't,
I'm still pretty young.

05:34.085 --> 05:35.336
I guess I'll always be young.

05:35.586 --> 05:38.339
You come with me. We're
gonna get you that waffle.

05:39.799 --> 05:42.176
Why would Erin confide in me that
she's staying here in Florida

05:42.260 --> 05:45.179
if she didn't want me to make some
sort of last ditch, nothing-to-lose,

05:45.263 --> 05:46.931
Kelly Ka-who run at her?

05:47.557 --> 05:48.558
HEY
HEY

05:49.308 --> 05:50.560
Watson Carpet & Tile.

05:50.643 --> 05:51.936
One order.

05:52.103 --> 05:56.024
Order reference
number 00983-126.

05:56.107 --> 05:58.359
Eight cases
Bright White Inkjet.

05:58.443 --> 05:59.402
Paid.

05:59.485 --> 06:01.154
I'm dying!

06:03.531 --> 06:05.116
Processed.
And delivered.

06:05.199 --> 06:07.744
Sometimes I get so bored,
I just wanna scream.

06:07.827 --> 06:09.954
And then sometimes,
I actually do scream.

06:10.079 --> 06:12.373
I just sort of feel out
what the situation calls for.

06:13.374 --> 06:14.792
I will be right back.

06:14.917 --> 06:16.294
I will be here.

06:16.919 --> 06:21.215
Hey, I see what you're doing. It's futile.
The V.P. position is mine.

06:21.299 --> 06:23.051
Oh, please, you're through.

06:23.134 --> 06:27.055
She's going to give it to me, as
I'm giving it to her tonight.

06:27.138 --> 06:30.475
The cowgirl has chosen her saddle.

06:32.643 --> 06:35.188
Well, saddles...

06:36.689 --> 06:38.066
...sometimes fall off.

06:38.149 --> 06:40.860
Especially if you don't
properly cinch the girth.

06:40.943 --> 06:44.614
What? That's a joke, right? You
see the way she's all over me.

06:46.574 --> 06:50.661
If anyone's having sex with Nellie
for personal gain, it's me.

06:50.745 --> 06:52.622
And I'm not joking at all.

06:52.705 --> 06:55.249
If you don't tighten your
saddle, you may fall off.

06:55.958 --> 06:57.960
Who is ready for dinner?

06:58.044 --> 07:03.007
"Oh, I bet it's pizza or tacos
or something stupid." No.

07:04.383 --> 07:05.760
I went south of
the border for this,

07:05.885 --> 07:07.261
and then I went
south of that border,

07:07.595 --> 07:11.182
and we have ourselves
a Jamaican feast, man.

07:12.642 --> 07:14.352
If I wanted Jamaican food,
I'd just hire

07:14.477 --> 07:16.187
a bunch of
bodyguards and go there.

07:16.354 --> 07:20.608
Additional trivia factoid, this
food comes to us through Val,

07:20.691 --> 07:23.694
and our server is none other
than Brandon, her boyf.

07:24.237 --> 07:25.363
Hey.

07:25.530 --> 07:26.656
How you doing, guys?

07:28.116 --> 07:31.160
Jamaican, huh? I just read about
the elections down there.

07:31.244 --> 07:32.245
Crazy stuff.

07:32.370 --> 07:33.579
Oh, no. I'm not
actually Jamaican.

07:33.704 --> 07:34.956
Terrific.

07:35.039 --> 07:36.791
What's up, man? I'm Darryl.

07:36.874 --> 07:38.251
Oh, Darryl.
I heard about you.

07:38.417 --> 07:39.710
You doing good?
Oh, yeah.

07:39.794 --> 07:41.754
You must be doing real good since
you're  my girlfriend.

07:42.547 --> 07:43.631
Whoa!

07:43.714 --> 07:47.218
Dude, you didn't tell me you
were  Val. High five!

07:47.426 --> 07:48.636
I'm not sleeping
with your girlfriend.

07:48.719 --> 07:50.096
Brandon, what the hell
are you talking about?

07:50.179 --> 07:51.514
Don't play dumb with me.
I know what's up.

07:51.597 --> 07:52.598
Honey, I am not sleeping...

07:52.682 --> 07:56.310
Hey! Hey.
Let's get back to the food.

07:56.394 --> 07:58.813
Brandon, tell us about
these delicious-looking goops.

08:00.022 --> 08:01.190
Hope you all like goat.

08:01.691 --> 08:03.025
Goat.

08:04.152 --> 08:06.154
Blow in my ear.
All right.

08:06.237 --> 08:07.822
Like I'm on the beach.

08:12.910 --> 08:13.911
A seagull.

08:14.745 --> 08:16.789
And a wave crashing.

08:18.291 --> 08:19.458
A wave crashing.

08:20.835 --> 08:22.837
Oh, that is lovely.

08:24.380 --> 08:26.716
All right, that's
gonna do it for me tonight.

08:27.466 --> 08:28.676
Have a lovely evening.

08:41.147 --> 08:42.231
Hey, how's it going?

08:42.315 --> 08:46.027
Good. The heating system, though,
in my room is all messed up.

08:46.110 --> 08:47.445
It's like 90 degrees
in there.

08:47.987 --> 08:50.114
Maintenance is working on it.
Can I hang out in here?

08:50.198 --> 08:52.575
Uh... Yeah, I'm just
watching basketball...

08:52.658 --> 08:54.827
Okay. Yeah.
Okay.

08:55.119 --> 08:56.287
Cool.

08:59.373 --> 09:01.167
Is this March Madness?
I love March Madness.

09:01.250 --> 09:05.129
Oh, no. That's not this.
Because that's in March.

09:05.755 --> 09:08.716
This is just the NBA,
professional.

09:08.799 --> 09:11.552
Miami Heat, actually. So...

09:11.636 --> 09:13.387
LeBron James.
Yes.

09:13.471 --> 09:16.766
Nice, good word association.

09:30.071 --> 09:31.155
Impressive.

09:31.239 --> 09:33.407
Oh, please,
anyone can tie a knot.

09:33.491 --> 09:36.160
The real skill
is in untying it.

09:38.913 --> 09:40.539
Thornwood Wholesalers.

09:40.623 --> 09:41.582
One order.

09:41.666 --> 09:42.917
I read the texts
you sent to Val, man.

09:43.000 --> 09:44.627
That's messed up.

09:44.752 --> 09:45.920
Is this spicy?

09:46.003 --> 09:47.588
No, baby girl.
It would be messed up

09:47.713 --> 09:49.340
if I didn't find anything.
But I did, so...

09:49.507 --> 09:52.260
I'm pretty sure if
Darryl sent Val a text,

09:52.343 --> 09:54.720
it was about some paper
emergency or something.

09:54.804 --> 09:55.805
At midnight?

09:57.390 --> 09:58.766
It happens.

09:58.849 --> 10:01.102
Like, a hospital needs
more napkins for surgery.

10:01.185 --> 10:02.728
You guys, we're not gonna
settle anything this way.

10:02.853 --> 10:05.064
I think we just need to be
grown-ups here. Thank you.

10:05.189 --> 10:06.524
I think we're gonna
need to hear those texts.

10:06.732 --> 10:09.110
Kelly, remember how you wanted
to go home before?

10:09.193 --> 10:11.612
No. There's no way
in hell I'm leaving.

10:11.696 --> 10:13.281
Something interesting
is happening here.

10:13.406 --> 10:15.032
For once in my life.
I am staying here.

10:15.116 --> 10:16.284
Darryl, read the texts!

10:19.829 --> 10:21.580
Yep? Coming!

10:22.832 --> 10:25.876
All right. Hey. My minibar
is oddly out of rum.

10:25.960 --> 10:27.044
We have plenty.

10:27.211 --> 10:29.297
Oh. Hello.

10:29.380 --> 10:32.133
You wanna watch the game with us?
We're watching a game.

10:32.216 --> 10:33.759
The Heat game.
It's just a game.

10:33.843 --> 10:35.594
Got it. Good night.

10:36.512 --> 10:38.389
Careful, Jim,
it gets easier and easier.

10:38.472 --> 10:41.684
No. No, no. Stanley?
Stanley. Stanley?

10:42.310 --> 10:43.436
Stanley. All right. Hey!

10:43.519 --> 10:45.604
You know. Just bring
back those bottles!

10:47.857 --> 10:49.066
Huh. The lights
are still on.

10:49.150 --> 10:50.568
Yeah. They keep
them on, 'cause it's

10:50.693 --> 10:52.069
less expensive than
turning them on and off.

10:52.153 --> 10:54.864
I like how guys just
know stuff all the time.

10:54.947 --> 10:56.449
Girls know a lot
of stuff too, okay?

10:56.574 --> 10:58.075
And nobody
knows more than you.

10:58.159 --> 10:59.535
Especially me.

11:01.120 --> 11:04.165
Hello, waffle iron!

11:04.290 --> 11:06.083
Hello! What do
we have here?

11:06.167 --> 11:08.002
Okay, so the recipe
says we need

11:08.127 --> 11:10.004
a mixing bowl,
a measuring cup...

11:11.255 --> 11:12.757
Get down.

11:14.633 --> 11:15.843
It's the fuzz.

11:15.968 --> 11:17.219
Do you want us
to get scolded?

11:17.303 --> 11:20.556
Shut your beautiful,
beautiful mouth. Please.

11:23.392 --> 11:26.103
"I got too much ice cream,
you want some?"

11:27.271 --> 11:28.397
"Getting my fry on."

11:28.522 --> 11:29.690
Boring.

11:29.774 --> 11:31.400
"The moon is huge tonight."

11:31.525 --> 11:33.194
Gosh, the moon one's damning.

11:33.277 --> 11:34.570
Yeah, sorry.

11:34.653 --> 11:36.197
That's regular text talk.

11:36.280 --> 11:37.365
You forgot one.

11:37.865 --> 11:38.991
"You're such a great friend."

11:39.075 --> 11:40.284
With the dots.

11:40.368 --> 11:43.079
"You're such a great friend,
dot, dot, dot, dot, dot."

11:43.788 --> 11:46.457
Five dots, Darryl?
Are you kidding me?

11:46.540 --> 11:49.043
Okay, 'cause three dots means to
be continued, four dots is a typo.

11:49.126 --> 11:50.836
But five dots means,
"Whoa, do not

11:50.961 --> 11:52.713
make me say what I
want to say, baby,

11:52.797 --> 11:56.550
"but if I did, it would blow your
mind, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot."

11:56.967 --> 11:58.594
See? Yes, thank you, sister.

11:58.677 --> 12:01.555
Brandon, Darryl and me,
that's ridiculous.

12:01.639 --> 12:03.641
Right?
Yeah.

12:03.724 --> 12:07.395
Totally crazy. Puts me in an insane
asylum just thinking about it.

12:07.478 --> 12:09.313
I'm stranded on
Shutter Island over here.

12:10.481 --> 12:13.192
You look like Ed Harris.

12:13.401 --> 12:14.985
If they stretched
him a little bit...

12:15.736 --> 12:18.364
You wanna see a picture of me
trapped under a tree?

12:21.075 --> 12:22.076
Uh...

12:22.743 --> 12:24.412
Excuse me.

12:24.495 --> 12:25.788
What? Not now. I'm busy.

12:25.996 --> 12:27.081
I'm sorry,
I thought you'd want to know

12:27.206 --> 12:28.332
that I saw
a bedbug in my room.

12:28.416 --> 12:29.750
But never mind.
Sorry to interrupt.

12:29.834 --> 12:31.335
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Bedbugs?

12:32.670 --> 12:33.796
Oh, no.

12:38.676 --> 12:39.718
Freak, I need a favor.

12:40.261 --> 12:43.848
Well, then you have to call me by my name.
Gabriel Susan Lewis.

12:43.931 --> 12:44.932
I've gotta be gone
for a few minutes.

12:45.015 --> 12:47.184
You make sure that Packer
does not sleep with Nellie.

12:47.852 --> 12:49.395
What's in it for G.S.L.?

12:49.520 --> 12:50.813
You really want
Packer as your boss?

12:50.896 --> 12:52.106
Got it.

12:53.149 --> 12:55.401
If Jim has bedbugs,
that means they're everywhere.

12:55.776 --> 12:57.820
I can't risk them coming
back to Schrute Farms.

12:57.945 --> 13:00.698
Our biggest attraction is our
200-hundred-year-old mattresses.

13:02.616 --> 13:04.577
Where did you see it?
In the bed.

13:04.702 --> 13:06.036
Well, I haven't seen anything.

13:06.120 --> 13:08.747
We gotta find it
before it eggs.

13:08.831 --> 13:09.915
Jeez!

13:11.375 --> 13:13.878
Describe it.
Brown, shiny, painful bite.

13:13.961 --> 13:15.045
Could be a bat weevil.

13:15.129 --> 13:17.715
Describe its mood.
Did it seem sleepy?

13:17.798 --> 13:20.301
Stressed, but to be fair,
it was a tense situation.

13:20.384 --> 13:22.678
Fair enough. But after it bit
you, did it run away fearful?

13:22.761 --> 13:25.181
Or did it walk away smug,
self-assured?

13:25.264 --> 13:28.559
So smug. Like he thought
it was funny. Like this.

13:28.809 --> 13:30.269
That's a bedbug.
Yeah.

13:30.352 --> 13:32.021
Everything's a joke.
I know.

13:32.104 --> 13:33.105
Check your hair!

13:34.690 --> 13:37.526
God! It's so greasy. You
should just shave all this.

13:37.610 --> 13:38.611
Just check it.

13:38.903 --> 13:41.447
You are clean. Okay.

13:41.530 --> 13:45.367
The one thing a bedbug thrives
on is heat and carbon dioxide.

13:45.951 --> 13:49.163
I am gonna generate myself
into a human trap.

13:49.246 --> 13:51.248
When I jump into the bed,
you are gonna

13:51.415 --> 13:53.417
cover me with
the sheet immediately.

13:53.667 --> 13:55.836
And then,
we'll see who's laughing.

13:55.920 --> 13:56.962
All right!

13:58.339 --> 13:59.507
Yeah!

13:59.757 --> 14:00.758
Cover me!

14:01.091 --> 14:02.092
Is this really necessary?

14:02.259 --> 14:03.260
He knows what he's doing.

14:04.261 --> 14:06.013
Let the bedbugs bite!

14:06.263 --> 14:08.015
God! I feel so gross!
I have to go take a shower.

14:08.098 --> 14:09.934
All right,
then I will catch you later.

14:11.185 --> 14:12.186
What do we do now?

14:12.269 --> 14:13.312
We wait.

14:15.105 --> 14:16.732
Come to Papa!

14:18.192 --> 14:19.193
No!

14:28.994 --> 14:30.329
I don't know, Dwight.
I think maybe you should...

14:30.412 --> 14:31.622
No, I wasn't bitten.

14:32.540 --> 14:33.707
Okay, well, maybe it's not
warm enough in here.

14:33.791 --> 14:34.792
It's plenty warm.

14:34.875 --> 14:36.627
And I was farting continuously
under the sheet,

14:36.752 --> 14:38.128
creating a kind of a greenhouse effect.
Come on.

14:38.212 --> 14:39.755
If there were any
in here, they would

14:39.838 --> 14:40.881
have imbedded
themselves in me.

14:40.965 --> 14:42.633
You know what?
Maybe they just ate.

14:42.758 --> 14:44.426
No, you're good.
Clean bill of health.

14:44.510 --> 14:46.178
Besides, I gotta
get back downstairs.

14:46.262 --> 14:48.681
I left Packer alone with
Nellie for way too long.

14:48.764 --> 14:50.641
Okay, well, they're
fine, they're adults.

14:50.724 --> 14:52.184
No. That's the problem.

14:52.268 --> 14:55.813
Packer is trying to bed Nellie for the V.P.
job, unless I do it first.

14:55.896 --> 14:57.314
Is that really how you
want to get this job?

14:57.815 --> 14:59.066
Such a chorus girl.

14:59.149 --> 15:02.695
Okay, Dwight? Dwight?
Dwight, Dwight, Dwight.

15:03.320 --> 15:04.321
Uh...

15:07.783 --> 15:09.368
ls "crazy" gone?

15:24.675 --> 15:25.676
Oh...

15:28.262 --> 15:31.015
They don't make these cords
in boot cut anymore!

15:33.684 --> 15:34.685
Aw...

15:35.853 --> 15:37.021
Pathetic, huh?

15:37.938 --> 15:40.733
A real man swallows his vomit
when a lady is present.

15:45.404 --> 15:46.405
Hey.

15:48.532 --> 15:51.368
Yep, one Death by Chocolate,
one Bananas Foster.

15:51.910 --> 15:52.911
Okay, cool. Thanks.

15:54.371 --> 15:56.707
I know, I'm a pig, right?

15:57.708 --> 15:59.501
Wait, this is why I
exercise like a fiend.

15:59.585 --> 16:01.045
Feel. Seriously.

16:01.211 --> 16:02.671
Okay. All right.

16:02.755 --> 16:05.132
I'm really sorry.
I just have to say it.

16:05.215 --> 16:06.634
I'm married.

16:07.092 --> 16:08.510
I'm very happily married.

16:08.594 --> 16:10.346
Oh, my God,
what are you thinking?

16:11.513 --> 16:12.514
Um...

16:13.182 --> 16:14.141
I mean...

16:14.224 --> 16:16.602
I know that you're married,
I sat at your wife's desk.

16:17.353 --> 16:18.687
How little do you
think of me?

16:19.938 --> 16:23.108
I'm sorry, I feel like
maybe I misread things.

16:23.567 --> 16:26.737
Okay. Let's just
go back to watching.

16:27.112 --> 16:30.282
Can you, without running to the
other side of the room all night?

16:31.492 --> 16:33.702
Yes. I can. Uh...

16:33.786 --> 16:36.664
All right.
I'm really sorry.

16:36.747 --> 16:38.582
I think we'll just...
We'll just watch.

16:38.666 --> 16:40.209
You can watch, not watch,
whatever you wanna do.

16:40.334 --> 16:42.336
Take another shower, I don't care.
Okay.

16:44.046 --> 16:45.047
Whoo...

16:45.547 --> 16:47.383
I am so cold.

16:51.762 --> 16:54.181
Hey, Darryl, you okay?

16:54.264 --> 16:55.724
She's got a boyfriend.

16:55.808 --> 16:58.310
Play it cool, man.
She'll come around.

16:59.687 --> 17:01.188
No, you should go for it.
Mmm...

17:01.271 --> 17:03.065
I mean, nothing would've
happened with me and Jim

17:03.148 --> 17:04.400
if he didn't put
himself out there.

17:04.483 --> 17:09.113
Yeah, but my friend Jim would
tell you to play it cool.

17:09.822 --> 17:12.700
My husband would
tell you to go for it.

17:14.451 --> 17:16.036
Hey. Hey-
Hey. Hey-

17:16.120 --> 17:17.871
This is fun.
A lot of fun.

17:17.955 --> 17:20.290
I know. Can I give
you a compliment?

17:20.374 --> 17:22.710
I'm really impressed
by how much you've grown.

17:22.793 --> 17:24.795
Since I met you,
it's like night and day.

17:24.920 --> 17:27.214
You should move down here with me!
Yeah?

17:27.297 --> 17:28.799
We could be roommates.
Really?

17:28.882 --> 17:31.885
We could get a dog,
we could go to R-rated movies!

17:31.969 --> 17:34.388
And who knows, I mean,
you're a guy, I'm a girl.

17:34.471 --> 17:35.472
Yeah.

17:35.514 --> 17:38.392
Maybe in six months, we'll see.
Six months!

17:38.475 --> 17:40.894
Okay. I'm in love
with Kelly.

17:45.566 --> 17:48.652
Put your forehead near mine and
see if you can read my thoughts.

17:49.069 --> 17:50.446
Okay.

17:51.697 --> 17:54.241
Seven,one,oneâ€œ.

17:54.867 --> 17:58.120
Nine... No,no,no, not numbers.
No.

17:58.203 --> 18:01.623
No, okay. Try again.

18:02.166 --> 18:03.417
Okay.

18:05.669 --> 18:07.796
I'm still getting numbers.
Seven,one,oneâ€œ.

18:07.880 --> 18:11.508
Is anyone around here thinking
the numbers seven, one, one?

18:12.342 --> 18:14.261
Please stop. Okay?

18:14.344 --> 18:16.263
Dwight, give me
a key card to your room.

18:17.139 --> 18:23.228
Meet me in seven minutes
for some one-on-one time.

18:23.312 --> 18:24.521
Wait, the numbers.

18:28.901 --> 18:32.112
There you go.
I will see you in seven...

18:32.196 --> 18:33.906
Seven minutes.

18:42.873 --> 18:43.916
Nellie, wait.

18:45.626 --> 18:48.796
Let me write my room
number on the card.

18:51.006 --> 18:53.717
Win at all costs.
Don't respect women.

18:53.842 --> 18:57.387
These are the tenets I was brought up
with, and they have served me well.

18:58.055 --> 19:00.808
But my ancestors never worked
in corporate America.

19:00.891 --> 19:04.019
They were farmers,
and before that, hunters,

19:04.269 --> 19:09.608
and before that, time travelers,
and before that, me again.

19:09.817 --> 19:11.360
At least that's
how the legend goes.

19:11.443 --> 19:14.571
The point is, they never had to
worry about how they got ahead.

19:14.947 --> 19:18.367
They just had to put food on the
table and not alter the past.

19:18.992 --> 19:22.788
1434-967, paid.

19:22.913 --> 19:24.456
It has been processed.

19:24.581 --> 19:26.166
It has been delivered.

19:26.583 --> 19:29.002
That's it, last one.

19:29.086 --> 19:31.505
Andy, this has been
an amazing night. Epic.

19:31.588 --> 19:33.340
Cool down fiesta
begins right now.

19:33.423 --> 19:35.467
I got decaf coffee.
No way.

19:35.551 --> 19:38.345
I've got Romy and Michele's
High School Reunion.

19:39.221 --> 19:40.430
He)'

19:40.514 --> 19:43.809
I just wanted to apologize.
I mean, that was so weird.

19:44.226 --> 19:45.978
Can we just like
never talk about it again?

19:46.061 --> 19:47.145
Sure.
Okay, thanks.

19:47.271 --> 19:50.148
Hey, just so you know,
me and you,

19:50.774 --> 19:55.320
I don't think that's ridiculous.
Dot, dot, dot, dot, dot.

20:09.334 --> 20:11.670
All right. Now I think
it's time for you to go.

20:11.879 --> 20:14.548
What? Jim!

20:14.965 --> 20:16.508
I thought we talked about this.
You're cool, right?

20:16.592 --> 20:18.051
Cathy! Go.

20:19.761 --> 20:21.221
Where's the bug?
Awesome!

20:21.972 --> 20:23.015
Stand back!

20:23.098 --> 20:25.100
Stop it! Oh, my gosh!
That burns! What is that?

20:25.183 --> 20:27.603
It's a compound of chemicals I
pulled off of the maid's cart.

20:27.895 --> 20:29.646
Oh, my God!
Dwight, there!

20:30.397 --> 20:32.107
Oh, God! Stop it! Stop it!

20:32.190 --> 20:33.400
Big one! Big one!

20:33.483 --> 20:35.485
I think I saw it!
I think I saw it!

20:35.569 --> 20:36.570
Stop it!

20:37.863 --> 20:39.489
Nice job, I think
you got him.

20:39.615 --> 20:42.367
You can't stay
here, this place is a biohazard.

20:42.701 --> 20:44.661
If I were you,
I'd just bunk with Cathy.

20:54.087 --> 20:56.673
Second best Bananas
Foster I've ever had.

20:56.757 --> 20:58.508
Yeah, what's the first best?

20:59.927 --> 21:03.221
Dwight?

21:03.513 --> 21:05.515
Hello? Dwight?

21:05.641 --> 21:07.643
- Is that Nellie?
- Don't!

21:07.726 --> 21:09.102
Are you in there?

21:09.186 --> 21:11.563
I can see the light
on under your door.

21:13.231 --> 21:14.358
Hello?

21:15.734 --> 21:16.944
Oh, look at that.

21:17.027 --> 21:20.030
The light went off just as
I said the light went on.

21:21.782 --> 21:24.868
Hello? Dwight?

21:28.956 --> 21:30.165
Dwight?
