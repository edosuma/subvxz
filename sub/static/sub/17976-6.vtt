PREVIOUSLY ON
THE L WORD...

00:12.067 --> 00:13.933
YOU DID IT, DIDN'T YOU?
YOU AND DANA.

00:13.968 --> 00:16.167
YEAH.

00:16.199 --> 00:17.234
YOU KISSED JENNY?

00:17.266 --> 00:18.167
YEAH.

00:18.199 --> 00:19.701
I-I DIDN'T THINK
THAT YOU WOULD MIND.

00:19.734 --> 00:21.634
THEN, NO,
AND, HEY, AND I DON'T.

00:21.667 --> 00:23.167
STARTING
A NEW PROJECT.

00:23.199 --> 00:25.266
THIS JOURNAL OF MY LIFE
WITH THE TWO OF YOU GUYS.

00:25.300 --> 00:26.734
BASICALLY, IT'S JUST
GOING TO BE INTERVIEWS.

00:26.766 --> 00:29.501
WOW.

00:29.533 --> 00:31.300
OKAY, I TAKE YOUR POINT, MAN.

00:31.333 --> 00:32.466
YEAH,
HIDDEN CAMERAS, MAN.

00:32.500 --> 00:34.466
IT'S THE WAY
TO DO THIS.

00:34.500 --> 00:36.067
SINCE MY WORK
IN T.O.E.,

00:36.100 --> 00:38.634
THE PLANET HAS GONE
FROM BEING IN THE RED TO BLACK.

00:38.667 --> 00:39.767
AND...

00:39.801 --> 00:41.267
AND BENJAMIN

00:41.299 --> 00:43.901
IS THE BEST THING
THAT'S EVER HAPPENED TO ME.

00:43.933 --> 00:45.500
SO I'M GOING TO STAY
IN THE GUEST ROOM

00:45.533 --> 00:46.968
UNTIL I FIND A PLACE OF MY OWN.

00:47.000 --> 00:48.801
WELCOME HOME.

00:48.834 --> 00:50.801
HELENA PEABODY
IS ON HER WAY OVER HERE.

00:50.834 --> 00:51.834
RIGHT NOW?

00:51.868 --> 00:52.968
WE GOT
THE BIGGEST GRANT

00:53.000 --> 00:54.000
THAT THEY GAVE.

00:54.033 --> 00:55.167
NOBODY ELSE
GOT AS MUCH MONEY.

00:55.200 --> 00:56.834
WHAT IS GOING ON HERE?
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

00:56.868 --> 00:59.399
I'M HERE TO PUBLICIZE
OUR GRANT ANNOUNCEMENT.

00:59.433 --> 01:01.500
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
WITH MY GIRLFRIEND?

01:01.534 --> 01:02.968
DID YOU KNOW
THAT TINA WAS PREGNANT?

01:03.067 --> 01:04.067
BETTE, YOU DIDN'T KNOW?

01:04.067 --> 01:04.968
OH, MY GOD.

01:05.067 --> 01:06.400
HOW DID YOU
NOT KNOW?

01:06.434 --> 01:08.067
BECAUSE I AM JUST
THE BIGGEST FUCKING ASSHOLE

01:08.067 --> 01:09.067
IN THE UNIVERSE.

01:09.067 --> 01:09.567
I GUESS THAT'S HOW.

01:15.968 --> 01:16.934
THANKS
FOR JOINING ME.

01:16.968 --> 01:18.968
I DON'T USUALLY
DO THIS,

01:19.067 --> 01:20.900
SOCIALIZE
WITH MY STUDENTS.

01:20.934 --> 01:23.968
I'M GLAD YOU'RE MAKING
AN EXCEPTION FOR ME.

01:24.067 --> 01:25.067
WELL, YOU KNOW,

01:25.067 --> 01:27.567
IT GETS KIND OF LONELY
ON THE ROAD SOMETIMES.

01:27.600 --> 01:28.867
YEAH.

01:28.900 --> 01:29.968
YOU MUST MISS YOUR FAMILY.

01:33.100 --> 01:34.933
I-I'M SORRY.

01:34.968 --> 01:36.399
DID I OVERSTEP?

01:36.433 --> 01:39.100
I'M TRYING TO DO
THE RIGHT THING, KIT.

01:39.133 --> 01:42.933
I'M AWAY FROM THEM
NINE MONTHS OUT OF THE YEAR,

01:42.968 --> 01:45.399
SLEEPING ALONE IN HOTEL ROOMS...

01:45.433 --> 01:47.200
[LAUGHS]

01:47.234 --> 01:48.600
YEAH, BACK IN THE DAY,
I DEALT WITH IT

01:48.634 --> 01:51.234
BY JUST GETTING HAMMERED
EVERY NIGHT

01:51.267 --> 01:53.533
AND WAKING UP
WITH A DIFFERENT MAN

01:53.567 --> 01:54.600
EVERY MORNING.

01:56.567 --> 01:58.466
WELL, I'M GLAD
YOU DON'T FEEL THE NEED

01:58.500 --> 01:59.767
TO DO THAT ANYMORE.

01:59.801 --> 02:01.266
I CAN'T SAY

02:01.300 --> 02:05.267
THAT I DON'T FEEL THE NEED.

02:05.299 --> 02:07.968
I JUST DON'T ACT ON IT
LIKE I USED TO.

02:11.634 --> 02:15.534
WELL, I GUESS
IT'S GOODBYE, THEN.

02:15.567 --> 02:17.934
YEAH, YEAH,
WELL, LOOK...

02:17.968 --> 02:19.067
THANKS FOR
KEEPING ME COMPANY.

02:19.067 --> 02:20.100
I REALLY
APPRECIATE IT.

02:20.132 --> 02:22.766
OH, IT WAS MY PLEASURE.

02:47.968 --> 02:49.433

02:49.466 --> 02:53.968

04:21.367 --> 04:22.734
IT'S JUST
THE ONLY THING I HAVE

04:22.766 --> 04:25.600

05:23.466 --> 05:24.634
IT'S KIND OF A MESS.

05:24.667 --> 05:27.434
I'M NOT REALLY
PREPARED FOR COMPANY.

05:27.466 --> 05:28.567
I WAS JUST ON MY WAY TO BRUNCH,

05:28.600 --> 05:29.567
AND I THOUGHT

05:29.600 --> 05:31.466
I'D DROP OFF

06:00.000 --> 06:01.334
I CAN'T BELIEVE
SHE SAW ME LIKE THIS.

06:01.367 --> 06:02.701
LIKE WHAT?

06:02.734 --> 06:04.533
LIKE A PREGNANT WOMAN AT HOME
DOING NORMAL THINGS

06:04.567 --> 06:05.533
IN HER APARTMENT?

06:05.567 --> 06:06.533
LIKE A NORMAL PERSON

06:06.567 --> 06:07.767
WHO DOESN'T LOOK LIKE

06:07.801 --> 06:09.433
SHE WAS ALWAYS DRESSED
PERSONALLY BY YVES ST. LAURENT?

06:09.467 --> 06:11.333
I THINK
I'VE PUT HER OFF.

06:11.367 --> 06:12.400
DID YOU SEE THE WAY
SHE LOOKED AT ME?

06:12.433 --> 06:14.234
YEAH, I DID.

06:14.266 --> 06:16.132
IT WAS
A LITTLE BIT SCARY.

06:18.734 --> 06:20.466
ARE YOU SLEEPING WITH HER?

06:20.501 --> 06:21.968
NO.

06:22.067 --> 06:24.132
NO,
I HAVEN'T.

06:26.067 --> 06:27.466
ARE YOU GOING TO?

06:27.501 --> 06:29.067

DON'T BE RIDICULOUS.

06:36.399 --> 06:38.299

06:38.334 --> 06:40.968
HA.

06:45.067 --> 06:46.767
I DON'T KNOW.
I CAN'T TELL.

OKAY, DO YOU THINK
CARMEN IS INTO ME, HONESTLY?

06:49.366 --> 06:52.667

06:52.701 --> 06:54.634
WAS SHE JUST KIND OF, LIKE,

06:58.067 --> 06:59.067
WAIT A MINUTE.

06:59.067 --> 07:00.000

07:05.801 --> 07:07.067
AND NOW YOU'RE GOING OUT
WITH THE SAME GIRL.

07:07.067 --> 07:08.868
I AM DEFINITELY
NOT GOING OUT WITH HER.

07:08.900 --> 07:10.067
AND THAT'S COOL?

07:10.067 --> 07:11.666
YOU GUYS-- IS THAT COMMON?

07:11.701 --> 07:13.933
YOU GUYS JUST SHARE CHICKS
AND SHIT?

07:16.234 --> 07:17.067
WE DON'T SHARE.

07:17.067 --> 07:17.900
I DON'T DATE CARMEN ANYMORE.

07:17.934 --> 07:19.300

OF COURSE, YOU HAVE
YOUR TWO-FUCK LIMIT, RIGHT?

07:21.466 --> 07:23.434
SHANE, HOW DO YOU
EVEN CONVINCE A GIRL

07:23.466 --> 07:25.266
TO GO HOME WITH YOU?

07:25.300 --> 07:26.466
DOESN'T YOUR REPUTATION

07:26.501 --> 07:27.466
PRECEDE YOU
BY THIS POINT?

07:27.501 --> 07:28.466
HOW DO YOU?

07:28.501 --> 07:29.466
I DON'T KNOW.

07:29.501 --> 07:31.833
I MAKE A LOT
OF EYE CONTACT,

07:31.867 --> 07:33.433

07:33.466 --> 07:36.267
OH, AND WHAT SIGNS
AND SEALS THE DEAL

07:36.299 --> 07:39.167
IS I TELL
A TRAGIC CHILDHOOD STORY.

07:39.200 --> 07:40.433
OH, MARK...

07:40.466 --> 07:42.767
YOU'RE SO FULL OF SHIT.

07:42.801 --> 07:44.634
YOU KNOW IT'S TRUE.

07:44.667 --> 07:46.234
LOOK,
FROM WHAT I KNOW,

07:46.267 --> 07:49.366
THE MOST IMPORTANT THING
IS TO LISTEN.

07:49.399 --> 07:50.634
YOU GET THEM TALKING,

07:50.667 --> 07:52.067
AND YOU START HEARING
ABOUT THEIR LIFE,

07:52.067 --> 07:53.567
AND THEN YOU FIGURE OUT
WHAT THEY WANT.

07:53.600 --> 07:54.567
YEAH, IT'S TRUE.

07:54.600 --> 07:57.067
CHICKS DO LIKE TO TALK A LOT.

07:57.100 --> 07:58.933
BUT YOU DO NOT TALK TOO MUCH.

07:58.968 --> 08:00.000
THAT'S THE THING.

08:00.000 --> 08:01.266
TALKING TOO MUCH CAN KILL IT.

08:01.300 --> 08:02.334
YOU DON'T TELL
YOUR LIFE STORY,

08:02.367 --> 08:03.500
AND YOU DON'T HAVE THEM
TELL THEIRS.

08:03.533 --> 08:05.833
THAT'S IT.

08:05.868 --> 08:07.400
YOU SHOULD JUST SHOW HER,
SHANE.

08:07.434 --> 08:08.467
THINK ABOUT IT.

08:08.500 --> 08:09.833
I MEAN, YOU KNOW THIS GIRL.

08:09.868 --> 08:11.333
YOU'VE DATED HER, RIGHT?

08:11.367 --> 08:13.099
WHAT A TIME SAVER
IT WOULD BE FOR POOR JENNY

08:13.132 --> 08:15.166
JUST TO HAVE A LITTLE THREE-WAY.

08:15.199 --> 08:17.067
DON'T YOU THINK, JENNY?

08:17.067 --> 08:19.167
I HATE TO TELL YOU THIS, MARK,

08:19.199 --> 08:21.968
BUT I DON'T FUCK MY ROOMMATES.

08:23.199 --> 08:25.466
OH...DAMN.

08:38.234 --> 08:40.267

YEAH?

08:52.701 --> 08:54.067
I'M NOT GOING TO
DO THIS WITH YOU.

08:54.067 --> 08:55.500
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO DO WHAT?

08:55.533 --> 08:57.334
I'M NOT GOING TO SNEAK AROUND
WITH YOU.

08:57.366 --> 08:58.734
I'M NOT GOING TO BE

09:03.100 --> 09:04.333
I WANT YOU--

09:04.367 --> 09:05.567
I WANT YOU TO LEAVE HER.

09:05.601 --> 09:08.132
AL, I CAN'T DO THAT RIGHT NOW.

09:08.166 --> 09:09.132
WHY?

09:09.166 --> 09:10.067
BECAUSE...

09:10.099 --> 09:13.099
THE TOURNAMENT TOMORROW.

09:13.132 --> 09:14.734
BECAUSE TONYA SET UP
THE WHOLE THING,

09:14.766 --> 09:17.399
AND IT'S A REALLY
BIG DEAL FOR ME.

09:17.434 --> 09:20.399
OKAY, THAT'S IT FOR US.

09:20.434 --> 09:21.399
WHAT? NO, AL.

REALLY WANT TO BE WITH YOU.

09:49.933 --> 09:50.901

09:56.834 --> 10:00.000
WELL-- WELL, THEN, WILL YOU
BREAK UP WITH HER

10:00.000 --> 10:03.633
AFTER THE TOURNAMENT?

10:32.968 --> 10:34.901
HI.

10:34.933 --> 10:36.600

10:39.734 --> 10:40.901
YOU LOOK GOOD.

10:40.933 --> 10:42.167
[SCOFFS]

10:42.200 --> 10:44.267
I'M A MESS.

10:46.267 --> 10:48.667
ARE YOU GOING TO INVITE ME IN?

10:48.701 --> 10:50.200
TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH,

10:50.234 --> 10:51.200
I'M NOT REALLY
IN THE MOOD

10:51.234 --> 10:52.366
FOR COMPANY RIGHT NOW.

10:52.399 --> 10:54.767
I'D RATHER YOU CALLED FIRST.

10:54.801 --> 10:57.033
WELL, IS THE APARTMENT OKAY?

10:57.067 --> 10:58.767
I MEAN, ARE YOU
COMFORTABLE HERE?

10:58.801 --> 10:59.767
IT'S FINE.

10:59.801 --> 11:02.467
I'M FINE.

11:02.500 --> 11:04.067
IS THERE
SOMETHING IN PARTICULAR?

11:15.333 --> 11:16.600
WE SHOULD TALK, TINA.

11:16.634 --> 11:18.067
I MEAN,
I CAN'T CARRY ON

11:18.100 --> 11:20.199
AND PRETEND LIKE IT'S ALL FINE,

11:20.234 --> 11:21.800
AND THAT I'M NOT AS CONFUSED
AS HELL

11:21.833 --> 11:24.234
BY THE WHOLE THING.

11:24.266 --> 11:25.466
LOOK, I AM--

11:25.501 --> 11:27.067
I'M JUST GOING TO SAY
WHAT I HAVE TO SAY,

11:27.067 --> 11:29.968
AND I HOPE
THAT YOU'RE ABLE TO HEAR IT.

11:30.067 --> 11:31.734
OKAY.

11:39.133 --> 11:40.466
I DON'T KNOW

11:40.500 --> 11:42.334
HOW YOU COULD KEEP THIS BABY
A SECRET FROM ME.

11:42.366 --> 11:44.868
I DON'T KNOW HOW
YOU COULD LIE TO ME

11:44.901 --> 11:45.901
FOR NEARLY
FOUR MONTHS.

11:45.933 --> 11:46.901
I MEAN,
WE WERE STILL TOGETHER.

11:46.933 --> 11:48.067
WE WERE A COUPLE,

11:48.067 --> 11:50.399
AND YOU WERE PREGNANT,
AND I HAD NO IDEA.

11:50.433 --> 11:52.267
I PLANNED TO TELL YOU,
AND THEN YOU FUCKED OFF.

11:52.299 --> 11:53.267
I FUCKED UP.

11:53.299 --> 11:54.334
I DID NOT FUCK OFF.

11:54.366 --> 11:55.366
I DID NOT LEAVE.

11:55.399 --> 11:57.466
I AM STILL HERE.

11:57.500 --> 12:02.533
I WANT TO HAVE A PLACE
IN THIS BABY'S LIFE.

12:02.567 --> 12:04.868
THIS IS OUR BABY, TINA.

12:04.900 --> 12:06.267
OKAY, I KNOW
THAT IT'S COMPLICATED.

12:06.299 --> 12:07.734
I KNOW THAT THERE ARE
NO EASY ANSWERS.

12:07.767 --> 12:09.067
THERE'S PROBABLY
NO LEGAL PRECEDENT,

12:09.067 --> 12:10.534
AND, IF YOU PREFER,
WE CAN HIRE LAWYERS

12:10.567 --> 12:11.534
AND MAKE UP DOCUMENTS--

12:11.567 --> 12:12.467
I DON'T EVEN HAVE
A LAWYER ANYMORE.

12:14.166 --> 12:15.933
OKAY, FINE. I--

12:15.968 --> 12:17.067
YOU KNOW WHAT?

12:17.067 --> 12:18.367
I WOULD RATHER
THAT WE WORK IT OUT OURSELVES.

12:18.399 --> 12:19.734
WELL, I'M NOT SURE
I WANT TO WORK IT OUT,

12:19.766 --> 12:22.132
NOT IN THE WAY THAT YOU WANT IT.

12:24.266 --> 12:26.766
[SIGHS]

12:26.800 --> 12:28.333
DID YOU USE OUR SPERM?

12:28.367 --> 12:30.701
I USED THE SPERM WE HAD STORED
AT THE CRYOBANK, YES.

12:30.734 --> 12:32.466
THEN THIS IS OUR BABY, TINA.

12:32.500 --> 12:34.366
I CAN'T BELIEVE
THAT YOU'RE DOING THIS.

12:34.399 --> 12:35.366
YOU KNOW WHAT?

12:35.399 --> 12:36.466
WE CONCEIVED
OF THIS BABY TOGETHER.

12:36.500 --> 12:37.634
WE SEARCHED FOR A DONOR
TOGETHER.

12:37.667 --> 12:38.667
IN FACT, YOU KNOW WHAT?
I FOUND THE DONOR.

12:38.701 --> 12:40.366
MARCUS ALLENWOOD
IS A FRIEND OF MINE,

12:40.399 --> 12:41.366
AND IF WE WERE
HUSBAND AND WIFE,

12:41.399 --> 12:43.734
THIS WOULD BE MY BABY.

12:43.767 --> 12:45.234
LOOK, I JUST NEED
TO THINK ABOUT IT!

12:45.267 --> 12:46.067
OKAY?

12:47.567 --> 12:49.767
JUST GIVE ME SOME TIME.

12:52.234 --> 12:53.634
OKAY.

13:02.067 --> 13:04.434
OH, LAST ONE.

13:04.466 --> 13:05.434
DO YOU WANT THIS?

13:05.466 --> 13:07.567
NO, IT'S ALL YOURS.

13:07.601 --> 13:08.666
OH, THANK YOU.

13:28.800 --> 13:30.333
YOU'RE SUCH A TEASE.

13:30.367 --> 13:31.934
WELL, THEN,
KEEP GOING.

13:31.968 --> 13:33.767

OH, SHIT.

13:42.466 --> 13:43.734
OH, NOW YOU ARE, TOO.

13:43.767 --> 13:45.433
YOU'RE GOING TO STINK.

13:45.466 --> 13:47.299
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU JUST DID THAT.

13:47.334 --> 13:48.767
NO, I DIDN'T MEAN TO.

13:48.801 --> 13:49.767
OF COURSE I DIDN'T.

13:49.801 --> 13:51.734
I DON'T KNOW

14:08.933 --> 14:10.099
WOULD YOU?

14:10.132 --> 14:11.766
HELL, YEAH.
A LOT LESS THAN THAT, ACTUALLY.

14:11.801 --> 14:12.933

14:32.600 --> 14:33.968
I THINK THE REPUBLICANS
CAN BE HOT.

14:34.067 --> 14:35.533
TAKE IT BACK.

14:35.567 --> 14:36.767
WHY?

14:36.801 --> 14:41.267
BECAUSE REPUBLICANS
ARE FUCKING SCARY.

14:41.299 --> 14:44.067
SCARY CAN
SOMETIMES BE...

14:44.067 --> 14:46.234
SEXY.

14:46.267 --> 14:47.234
THEY'RE NOT SCARY.

14:47.267 --> 14:48.366
THEY'RE STUPID.

14:48.399 --> 14:49.366
THAT'S RIGHT,

14:49.399 --> 14:50.767
AND STUPID, SHANE...

14:52.466 --> 14:54.500

WITH A FRIEND?

14:57.667 --> 14:58.634

WELL WITHIN OUR PURVIEW.
