00:30.440 --> 00:31.646
Everyone, please.

00:34.720 --> 00:35.767
Please.

00:41.680 --> 00:45.162
It's my unfortunate responsibility
to share with you some terrible news.

00:47.440 --> 00:49.090
It seems that over the weekend,

00:49.760 --> 00:53.048
your fellow student, Marina Mills,
committed suicide.

01:06.280 --> 01:09.090
Is it true that she filmed it
on her webcam?

01:09.600 --> 01:12.410
One of your classmates died and all you
care about is whether you can see it?

01:14.760 --> 01:18.481
Apparently there was a video uploaded
to the university website this morning.

01:19.920 --> 01:23.527
Some of you were crafty enough
to grab it before we could take it down.

01:24.640 --> 01:26.529
I urge you not to... To watch it.

01:27.960 --> 01:29.849
Anyone caught sharing it
will be suspended.

01:29.960 --> 01:31.689
Period. No discussion.

01:34.360 --> 01:37.523
Were any of you friends with Marina?

01:39.440 --> 01:42.171
Or have any info
that can shed light on this tragedy?

01:43.680 --> 01:45.523
Well, if so, see me after class.

02:16.400 --> 02:18.323
Liv, this video's so cute!

02:27.560 --> 02:30.040
- So not scared.
- Yeah, right.

02:30.800 --> 02:32.006
So good.

04:05.160 --> 04:07.401
- Hey.
- Hey.

04:14.640 --> 04:17.079
- Hey. Hey.
- Hello.

04:17.160 --> 04:19.367
- Someone didn't come home last night.
- Yeah, again.

04:20.000 --> 04:22.600
So are you guys, like,
monogamous now or what?

04:22.680 --> 04:25.081
- Liv, it's not a dirty word. Jesus.
- I know.

04:25.200 --> 04:28.010
Clearly, I'm just jealous,
you know, being dumped.

04:28.120 --> 04:30.521
You were not dumped.
You knew him for one day.

04:30.640 --> 04:32.005
It was an amazing day.

04:47.440 --> 04:49.360
Mmm, yeah. Yeah, I like that. Yeah.

04:49.440 --> 04:50.566
- Eww!
- Oh, my God.

04:51.720 --> 04:53.360
- It's disgusting...
- Oh, no.

04:55.720 --> 04:57.688
So you're in a... In a relationship?

04:58.200 --> 04:59.531
Oh, here we go.

05:00.160 --> 05:01.400
No, it's super cool, it really is.

05:01.520 --> 05:03.800
I just, you know,
love all these precious little updates

05:03.880 --> 05:05.564
about you and Doctor Surfboard.

05:06.720 --> 05:08.563
- Good for you.
- Oh, shut up.

05:14.040 --> 05:15.883
What do I look like?
I'm a sophisticated lady.

05:16.040 --> 05:17.405
Wine and dine me.

05:19.720 --> 05:21.160
Another argument

05:21.240 --> 05:24.210
that Internet Addiction Disorder
doesn't belong in the DSM

05:24.840 --> 05:27.840
is that it's frequently
symptomatic of other disorders,

05:27.920 --> 05:30.082
depression, anxiety, trauma.

05:30.760 --> 05:33.764
Often, it's an escape from things
we don't wanna deal with,

05:33.880 --> 05:35.680
from our everyday lives...

05:35.760 --> 05:37.524
...to things far, far worse.

05:38.360 --> 05:40.760
Though the most common disorder
might just be

05:40.840 --> 05:42.251
that we have too much time on our hands...

05:42.760 --> 05:44.091
Play it cool.

05:44.840 --> 05:47.764
- Wait a few days.
- He already knows I'm not cool.

05:49.280 --> 05:51.200
I think we might have an excellent example

05:51.280 --> 05:55.126
of Internet Addiction Disorder
right here in class.

05:57.440 --> 05:59.966
Aside from Miss Woodson and Miss Mathison,

06:00.760 --> 06:03.604
does anyone else here experience symptoms?

06:09.200 --> 06:11.640
- Look at that. That's a nice one.
- I love it.

06:11.720 --> 06:13.290
Oh, I really like that filter.

06:13.720 --> 06:15.880
- I can show you how to do it.
- Look at Kobe.

06:15.960 --> 06:18.645
Jesus. When's he gonna get over you?

06:18.760 --> 06:20.200
Such a creeper.

06:20.280 --> 06:22.408
- He is not a creeper.
- Ooh.

06:23.720 --> 06:25.085
Who's that?

06:26.480 --> 06:27.811
A girl in my class.

06:29.120 --> 06:31.566
Zero friends.
How is that not, like, super weird?

06:32.160 --> 06:34.640
Maybe she just started
her profile or something.

06:36.600 --> 06:38.807
Is she, like, 12-years-old?

06:51.800 --> 06:53.000
Huh.

06:53.080 --> 06:54.684
I think she's really talented.

07:04.640 --> 07:05.846
I like it.

07:06.600 --> 07:09.524
You like it when she rips
her hair out during class?

07:09.640 --> 07:10.687
Oh, come on.

07:10.800 --> 07:13.007
Dude, I literally saw her
pull an eyelash out today.

07:13.160 --> 07:15.970
No. It's a condition.
It's called trichotillomania.

07:16.360 --> 07:19.280
You would know all about it if you cracked
open a textbook every once in a while.

07:19.360 --> 07:21.440
- Owned!
- Oh, whatever.

07:21.520 --> 07:23.120
I'm actually changing majors next year.

07:23.200 --> 07:24.645
Oh, yeah? And the year after that?

07:25.360 --> 07:26.360
- Owned!
- Come on.

07:26.440 --> 07:28.440
- Twofer.
- Whatever.

07:30.200 --> 07:32.726
What you making? Is that seafood curry?

07:33.200 --> 07:35.640
- That looks good.
- What? Seafood curry?

07:35.720 --> 07:37.484
No, this is paella...

08:54.520 --> 08:57.360
Well, my dad was a psychiatrist,
so I guess I, you know,

08:57.440 --> 08:59.966
- wanna follow in his footsteps.
- That's nice.

09:00.080 --> 09:01.360
Mmm.

09:01.440 --> 09:04.808
Are you doing it for credit or are
you just... You really wanna do it?

09:05.280 --> 09:06.486
I'm not sure.

09:07.240 --> 09:09.481
I just transferred.

09:09.600 --> 09:12.490
- I... I don't know anyone yet.
- Well, now you know me.

09:14.480 --> 09:16.084
Are you in the dorms?

09:17.280 --> 09:18.720
My friends and I,
we just got an apartment.

09:18.800 --> 09:22.486
It's amazing, but we're definitely
not getting any work done.

09:23.480 --> 09:25.721
- Too many friends.
- Exactly.

09:29.800 --> 09:31.325
I'll see you around campus.

09:33.840 --> 09:35.251
Bye, Laura.

09:48.960 --> 09:50.086
Hmm.

09:52.120 --> 09:53.690
I thought med students had homework.

09:53.800 --> 09:55.520
You're one to talk.

09:55.600 --> 09:58.080
What? I'm studying.
Internet Addiction Disorder.

09:58.200 --> 10:00.680
- And you're your own case study.
- Exactly.

10:05.480 --> 10:07.209
What's the deal with this girl?

10:09.480 --> 10:12.051
I don't know. I think she's lonely.

10:16.200 --> 10:19.010
She gonna be your friend
or your first mental patient?

10:19.800 --> 10:21.529
She'd be my second mental patient.

12:44.000 --> 12:46.840
She's going through every post
I've ever made in my life.

12:46.920 --> 12:49.526
Oh, whoa. She's crazy.

12:51.040 --> 12:52.530
Look what she just sent me.

12:52.800 --> 12:54.290
Wait, I wanna see.

12:58.680 --> 13:00.170
Oh.

13:02.120 --> 13:05.120
Really, you guys are gonna
live happily ever after together.

13:05.200 --> 13:06.964
- Oh, my God.
- Nice.

13:07.320 --> 13:08.890
Who is this person?

13:09.720 --> 13:10.800
I don't know.

13:10.880 --> 13:13.042
Dude, scroll down.
I wanna see her timeline.

13:16.200 --> 13:17.326
Further.

13:20.720 --> 13:22.006
Further.

13:28.720 --> 13:29.960
Whoa.

13:35.400 --> 13:36.731
Jesus.

13:46.200 --> 13:48.885
No wonder this girl's
giving you nightmares.

13:52.320 --> 13:53.765
Jesus.

13:55.080 --> 13:56.920
- OK.
- Oh, my God.

13:57.000 --> 14:00.561
Laura, this girl isn't right.
Why are you hanging out with her?

14:00.880 --> 14:02.450
I was just trying to be nice.

14:03.520 --> 14:05.200
God, I can't believe
you invited her to your birthday.

14:05.280 --> 14:08.204
No, no, no, no, I didn't invite her.
She invited herself.

14:08.720 --> 14:10.280
What was I supposed to say?

14:10.360 --> 14:12.203
Erm, how about something like "Fuck, no"?

14:13.240 --> 14:16.767
- Yeah, that sounds about right to me.
- You can't say that to someone.

14:16.880 --> 14:18.280
- Oh, yeah, it goes like this.
- Yes, you can.

14:18.360 --> 14:21.200
It goes like this. "Hey, Laura,
can I come to your birthday?"

14:21.280 --> 14:23.248
"Fuck, no." There you go.

14:58.000 --> 14:59.640
Laura, finally.

14:59.720 --> 15:01.006
Happy birthday.

15:01.480 --> 15:02.640
You look so pretty.

15:02.720 --> 15:05.480
- Thanks, Marina.
- You get my messages?

15:05.560 --> 15:07.608
Yeah. How can I miss them?

15:10.920 --> 15:14.080
Are you mad at me?
Did I do something wrong?

15:14.160 --> 15:16.766
No, I'm not mad at you. I'm just...

15:17.800 --> 15:21.009
- I'll see you in class tomorrow, OK?
- But what about tonight?

15:21.520 --> 15:23.443
Aren't you celebrating with your friends?

15:25.000 --> 15:26.843
Er... It's just Tyler and I tonight.

15:26.960 --> 15:29.770
We're going out to dinner,
so just the two of us.

15:35.840 --> 15:39.049
But you barely know her.
Isn't tonight just you and your friends?

15:39.160 --> 15:42.846
I know, I know.
I just feel, you know, icky lying about it.

15:43.840 --> 15:46.047
Well, you don't look very icky to me.

15:46.880 --> 15:48.689
Mmm!

15:49.880 --> 15:51.484
All right, go ahead.

15:52.720 --> 15:55.200
Hi. Hey.

15:56.440 --> 15:57.885
Hi, Mom.

16:02.000 --> 16:03.889
- Hey, happy birthday.
- Hey.

16:04.280 --> 16:06.726
I've been trying to get
your mom as drunk as possible.

16:07.480 --> 16:09.881
You, beautiful guy,
you need to get drunk immediately

16:10.000 --> 16:11.490
so we know what you're made of.

16:12.480 --> 16:14.130
Happy birthday!

16:14.960 --> 16:17.486
This is gonna be... A good time...

16:43.360 --> 16:44.725
Yeah!

16:49.400 --> 16:51.760
Yeah, it's literally her!
That was our inspiration.

16:51.840 --> 16:54.080
And the last reason, no matter what,

16:54.160 --> 16:56.606
that you always find
some crazy way to make me feel better.

16:57.080 --> 16:58.684
Aww.

16:59.400 --> 17:03.246
Wait, wait, wait, to my little green bean
who makes me so proud every day,

17:04.040 --> 17:07.886
and who made her father so proud
every single second.

17:09.119 --> 17:10.201
Oh, Mom.

17:13.960 --> 17:17.009
All right, I'm gettin' in,
I'm jumping in this little love boat.

17:17.119 --> 17:19.400
- No, I'm going, I'm going, OK?
- Oh, no.

17:19.480 --> 17:22.720
Er... This is... This is to us.

17:22.800 --> 17:24.200
A wonderful evening.

17:24.280 --> 17:26.681
To the future, to success.

17:27.119 --> 17:29.282
And you shut up, you drunk floozy.

17:29.440 --> 17:32.400
And then, this is also to, just to you,
to happy birthday.

17:32.480 --> 17:33.811
- Thanks, guys.
- Cheers.

17:44.320 --> 17:46.846
- Hey, Laura. How are you doing?
- Hey. How are you?

17:47.000 --> 17:48.650
- Good. Good.
- That's good.

17:51.480 --> 17:53.482
I thought we were friends.

17:53.840 --> 17:56.080
Marina, what are you,
what are you talking about?

17:56.160 --> 17:59.004
I saw you with everyone.
Your birthday dinner. I saw it.

17:59.960 --> 18:02.964
Marina, I'm sorry.
I... I didn't mean to hurt your feelings.

18:04.880 --> 18:06.689
Can we talk about this later? OK?

18:07.160 --> 18:10.130
I had a present for you.
I worked on it for two weeks.

18:11.680 --> 18:13.842
Two weeks?
You've barely known me for two weeks.

18:13.960 --> 18:15.689
You're a fucking liar
just like everyone else!

18:16.880 --> 18:19.800
Why did you accept my friendship?
You didn't have to do that!

18:19.880 --> 18:20.960
Get off me.

18:21.040 --> 18:22.600
You have any idea how it feels
to be alone?

18:22.680 --> 18:23.800
Completely alone?

18:23.880 --> 18:25.800
Get off me, you freak!

18:32.160 --> 18:34.003
Oh, God.

18:40.480 --> 18:42.403
Laura, you didn't do anything wrong.

18:42.520 --> 18:44.204
This chick is just damaged.

18:45.720 --> 18:47.085
You weren't there, Tyler.

18:47.600 --> 18:48.840
It's not your fault.

18:53.040 --> 18:55.640
Baby, I'm really sorry, I gotta get back
to cutting up dead people.

18:55.720 --> 18:56.840
OK.

19:01.000 --> 19:02.764
She's trying to face-chat me.
What do I do?

19:02.880 --> 19:04.405
Don't take the call.

19:04.520 --> 19:06.360
- Seriously.
- Fine, all right.

19:06.440 --> 19:08.090
I'll talk to you later.

19:08.200 --> 19:09.531
OK. Bye.

20:54.320 --> 20:55.481
Liv?

21:01.680 --> 21:02.966
Hmm.

22:30.440 --> 22:31.930
Are you OK?

22:37.000 --> 22:38.570
Go to bed.

22:58.800 --> 23:01.485
Remind me after class to tell you a story.

23:03.520 --> 23:05.648
Please. Everyone, please.

23:11.920 --> 23:15.606
It's my unfortunate responsibility
to share with you some terrible news.

23:16.520 --> 23:17.851
It seems that over the weekend,

23:17.960 --> 23:21.009
your fellow student, Marina Mills,
committed suicide.

23:33.040 --> 23:34.326
How'd it go?

23:35.840 --> 23:37.171
Fine.

23:38.640 --> 23:41.849
I just told them she was
stalking me and kind of went crazy.

23:42.160 --> 23:44.845
Hey, don't beat yourself up about it.

23:44.960 --> 23:48.480
- That girl was completely nuts.
- She needed help, though.

23:48.560 --> 23:50.528
Yeah, like, serious help.

23:51.120 --> 23:53.407
Not from a sophomore in Psych 201.

23:54.200 --> 23:57.120
Look on the bright side. Might be able
to get out of class for the funeral.

23:57.200 --> 23:58.440
God.

23:58.520 --> 24:00.522
No, no, no. There's not gonna be
a funeral, there's no body.

24:00.840 --> 24:02.046
What do you mean?

24:02.400 --> 24:06.086
Cops were at my dorm this morning and...

24:06.200 --> 24:08.202
They don't know where she did it,
but it wasn't there.

24:09.160 --> 24:12.084
I heard she hasn't swiped her key card
since last weekend.

24:12.720 --> 24:14.529
And that's not what freaks me out.
What freaks me out,

24:15.080 --> 24:17.162
is that they don't know
who this girl even was.

24:18.200 --> 24:20.362
Her, uh, contact info,
her social security,

24:20.520 --> 24:22.363
it's all been deleted
from the school database.

24:23.200 --> 24:26.204
They don't even think
that Marina Mills was her real name.

24:27.040 --> 24:29.202
- Are you serious?
- You all right?

24:31.720 --> 24:32.840
That's weird.

24:32.920 --> 24:34.684
You're killing my cheeseburger vibe.

25:47.480 --> 25:49.289
- Oh, my God.
- What's going on?

25:51.680 --> 25:53.603
Why are you watching this?

25:55.640 --> 25:57.688
- Who sent you this crap?
- She did.

25:58.000 --> 25:59.968
- She's dead.
- I know.

26:23.840 --> 26:26.320
Again, you'll have 60 minutes.

26:26.440 --> 26:30.161
This is an actual case study,
a very challenging one.

26:50.840 --> 26:52.046
Oh, my God.

26:58.000 --> 26:59.047
God.

27:00.400 --> 27:02.680
Is that the video? I thought you said
it was in your messages.

27:02.760 --> 27:03.886
You posted it?

27:04.000 --> 27:05.570
No, no. Someone did. I didn't.

27:07.360 --> 27:09.761
And they tagged all my friends.

27:14.840 --> 27:16.604
Laptops away, Miss Woodson.

27:19.240 --> 27:22.403
Why would they think I did that?
I would, I would never do that.

27:23.400 --> 27:26.847
- Did you try changing your password?
- Yes, yes. I tried everything.

27:32.080 --> 27:35.766
- She's even back in my friends list.
- Unfriend that dead bitch.

27:41.560 --> 27:42.891
I can't.

27:44.280 --> 27:46.880
So, according to you, Miss Woodson,
this video just magically appeared

27:46.960 --> 27:48.200
on your timeline this morning?

27:49.240 --> 27:52.130
- Do I have that right?
- Why would I do this?

27:54.600 --> 27:58.127
There must be some reason
this girl burned that picture of you.

27:58.720 --> 28:01.929
Look, Laura, we know
that you're a great student,

28:02.440 --> 28:04.966
but multiple students
reported you harassing Marina.

28:06.280 --> 28:08.328
No. She was the one harassing me.

28:10.480 --> 28:12.040
She was obsessed with me.

28:12.120 --> 28:14.930
Laura, no one's saying it's your fault
that Marina took her life.

28:15.320 --> 28:17.766
We're looking into everything.

28:18.400 --> 28:20.760
But in the meantime, Laura,
if you can't delete that video,

28:20.840 --> 28:23.161
you're gonna have to delete your profile.

28:23.960 --> 28:28.966
Hey, one more thing. Any idea where
this girl might have torched herself?

28:30.840 --> 28:32.080
No.

28:32.520 --> 28:35.600
No, you're not listening to me.
I can't delete this video.

28:35.680 --> 28:37.364
I can't even delete my account.

28:38.120 --> 28:40.040
Like I said, this isn't a call centre.

28:40.120 --> 28:42.880
OK, well, what about the dead girl
I can't unfriend?

28:42.960 --> 28:44.880
Can you do something about that?

28:44.960 --> 28:47.930
- Ma'am, I'm not seeing this profile.
- What? I just saw it.

28:50.800 --> 28:53.240
Is there anyone else I can speak to?

28:53.320 --> 28:55.049
I'm afraid they'll just tell you
the same thing.

28:59.360 --> 29:00.691
What's next?

29:12.640 --> 29:15.564
Kobe, I know you're in there.
I can hear your stupid game.

29:21.640 --> 29:23.529
That was a nice video you posted.

29:24.000 --> 29:25.843
Yeah, that's what I'm here about.

29:32.200 --> 29:33.361
Wow.

29:35.200 --> 29:36.440
You're her only friend.

29:36.520 --> 29:38.363
- How special is that?
- Shut up.

29:40.360 --> 29:42.522
Christ, someone's still uploading things.

29:56.240 --> 29:57.765
That... That's intense.

30:00.720 --> 30:02.404
I fucking love it.

30:03.040 --> 30:06.283
All right. OK, let's take
a little peek behind the curtain.

30:14.120 --> 30:15.281
What?

30:15.400 --> 30:17.289
You have no idea how crazy that is,
do you?

30:17.880 --> 30:19.041
OK.

30:20.240 --> 30:22.242
Look at that. Oh, that...

30:22.360 --> 30:23.805
That is what code normally looks like.

30:26.240 --> 30:27.241
Not this.

30:30.400 --> 30:33.085
I can't even copy this.
This isn't, this isn't code.

30:33.440 --> 30:35.090
Well, what is it?

30:37.240 --> 30:38.605
I don't know.

30:40.280 --> 30:41.930
Wait, wait. Can you go back?

30:51.800 --> 30:53.880
Just stop looking at that girl's profile.

30:53.960 --> 30:55.769
Just stop thinking about her.

30:56.440 --> 30:58.886
She killed herself. End of story.

31:00.240 --> 31:03.608
She burned and hung herself
in front of her laptop.

31:04.120 --> 31:05.485
Who does that?

31:07.080 --> 31:10.961
Is this gonna be a thing now,
you and Kobe hanging out in his dorm room?

31:11.600 --> 31:13.240
Is that really
what you're thinking about right now?

31:13.320 --> 31:15.687
Yeah. I'm thinking about us.

31:15.800 --> 31:17.131
What's wrong with that?

31:18.240 --> 31:20.641
He's just a friend. You know that.

31:20.920 --> 31:22.251
Does he?

31:30.840 --> 31:33.002
It's called cyber stalking for a reason.

31:33.600 --> 31:35.762
They can't bother you
if you're not online.

32:00.320 --> 32:01.480
Uh, yeah.

32:01.560 --> 32:04.848
Get me some of those, uh,
chocolate macadamia crisp thingies.

32:05.520 --> 32:07.960
No, they're not, uh...
Chocolate potato chips.

32:08.040 --> 32:09.800
They're like cookies.

32:09.880 --> 32:13.160
Like, uh, crackers, kind of.
Just ask the guy there.

32:13.240 --> 32:16.687
I go there all the time. The white
chubby kid who loves chocolate.

32:16.800 --> 32:20.000
Babe, you're not chubby.
But you're very fussy. My God.

32:20.080 --> 32:23.721
I'm not being fussy. I'm on my period
and chocolate makes me feel better.

32:26.360 --> 32:27.566
Isabel?

32:28.520 --> 32:30.045
Hello?

32:31.880 --> 32:33.325
Shit.

32:52.280 --> 32:53.406
Jenn?

32:55.240 --> 32:56.401
Hello?

33:05.760 --> 33:07.205
Kobe?

33:15.080 --> 33:16.809
Hey, guys, this isn't funny.

33:17.760 --> 33:19.000
Seriously.

33:23.120 --> 33:24.406
Guys?

33:40.760 --> 33:42.171
Koobes, come on, man.

33:57.360 --> 33:58.964
What the hell?

34:01.440 --> 34:02.805
What...

34:29.080 --> 34:30.320
What the f...

35:12.200 --> 35:14.362
No. No, no, no. No.

36:18.160 --> 36:19.605
Ugh.

36:38.600 --> 36:39.880
No!

36:39.960 --> 36:41.200
No!

37:06.240 --> 37:09.881
OK, so she's barely talking right now.

37:10.960 --> 37:13.566
They're gonna keep her overnight,
maybe longer.

37:14.840 --> 37:16.330
You can see her if you want.

37:21.480 --> 37:22.561
Listen...

37:23.000 --> 37:24.729
I didn't know Gustavo that well.

37:25.320 --> 37:27.687
Was he on something?

37:29.400 --> 37:30.606
No.

37:31.160 --> 37:33.160
I saw the medical report.

37:33.240 --> 37:34.844
It is insane.

37:49.880 --> 37:52.531
Please, just leave.

37:53.080 --> 37:54.525
Sweetheart.

37:56.200 --> 37:57.760
This is all her fault.

37:57.840 --> 37:59.524
She's not herself, Laura.

38:00.120 --> 38:03.442
No. Gus wasn't himself.

38:04.040 --> 38:05.929
He was having nightmares.

38:07.120 --> 38:08.320
So am I.

38:08.400 --> 38:11.051
You're scaring us, Izz.
What are you talking about?

38:11.520 --> 38:12.885
Laura knows.

38:16.080 --> 38:17.286
She knows.

38:50.320 --> 38:51.970
It doesn't feel real.

39:02.080 --> 39:04.321
Promise me you won't look
at that girl's profile today.

39:04.840 --> 39:06.604
You're driving yourself crazy.

39:55.720 --> 39:57.006
Delete your account.

39:58.560 --> 39:59.641
Seriously.

40:00.040 --> 40:01.405
You want Isabel to see that?

40:01.840 --> 40:04.684
- Liv, you know I can't.
- I don't care how.

40:05.200 --> 40:06.645
Just do it.

40:11.840 --> 40:13.001
Fuck.

40:32.840 --> 40:34.001
Fuck.

40:58.280 --> 41:00.123
Even if it's not you behind these posts,

41:01.040 --> 41:03.840
I'm getting a lot of pressure
from the students.

41:03.920 --> 41:06.880
As long as the posts are up,
I have no choice but to suspend you

41:06.960 --> 41:09.201
for the rest of the semester.

41:10.640 --> 41:13.291
Mom, you don't always have
to call me on FaceTime, you know.

41:13.400 --> 41:15.320
- Why didn't you call me?
- I'm sorry.

41:15.400 --> 41:17.289
I... I didn't want you to worry, OK?

41:17.400 --> 41:19.560
I'm coming to pick you up.
I want you home.

41:19.640 --> 41:22.883
No, look... Look, I'll call you later.
I promise, OK?

41:25.240 --> 41:26.401
Look at that.

41:29.280 --> 41:30.406
What the hell?

41:30.720 --> 41:32.927
Yeah. She friended him
right before he died.

41:39.600 --> 41:41.682
And there's something else.

41:43.000 --> 41:44.840
- Jesus, Kobe...
- I don't want you to watch it.

41:44.920 --> 41:46.285
I want you to listen.

41:54.360 --> 41:55.520
What is that?

41:55.600 --> 41:57.560
I don't know, I think it's wasps.

41:57.640 --> 41:59.688
She's got black wasps
all over her profile.

42:01.920 --> 42:04.890
I did some research, and, um,
some people associated them with evil.

42:07.040 --> 42:09.771
They say they appeared
wherever witches lived.

42:10.520 --> 42:13.444
That they'd, like, follow them around
and protect them.

42:17.120 --> 42:18.201
Jesus.

42:21.360 --> 42:22.646
Who was this girl?

42:26.160 --> 42:27.810
Do you think you could
get us into her room?

42:45.360 --> 42:46.407
Come on.

42:49.640 --> 42:51.324
Not much into fashion, was she?

43:02.480 --> 43:04.005
Do you even know what you're looking for?

43:04.400 --> 43:05.686
Well, just anything.

43:25.360 --> 43:26.885
Oh, hey, hey. Look, look, look.

43:28.720 --> 43:31.371
- That's her.
- Yeah, and who are these two?

43:31.600 --> 43:33.523
Can you find what school this is?

43:34.440 --> 43:36.124
If it's ever been online, yeah.

44:49.920 --> 44:51.922
Are you the young lady who called?

44:52.440 --> 44:53.646
Marina's friend?

44:54.840 --> 44:56.205
Yes.

45:04.200 --> 45:06.521
How close did you say you were again?

45:07.320 --> 45:10.130
I was just getting to know her when she...

45:12.440 --> 45:14.200
I didn't even know her real name.

45:14.280 --> 45:15.486
Nedifar.

45:16.160 --> 45:17.491
Marina Nedifar.

45:21.800 --> 45:23.131
Do you know what happened to her parents?

45:23.840 --> 45:26.810
I wouldn't know anything about that.
She came to us as a ward of the state.

45:29.000 --> 45:31.731
Poor girl. She had such
a rough go of things here.

46:04.840 --> 46:06.520
She was always very sensitive,

46:06.600 --> 46:07.886
always alone,

46:08.560 --> 46:10.927
fleeing into her little fantasy worlds.

46:13.120 --> 46:15.691
And she found some dark corners online,

46:16.240 --> 46:17.844
things no child should see.

46:19.720 --> 46:24.362
Sometimes she would just stare
at the computer for hours.

46:28.440 --> 46:33.128
Nothing on the screen at all.
Just her own reflection in the darkness.

46:35.120 --> 46:37.202
The kids became terrified of her.

46:41.560 --> 46:43.085
They said she gave them nightmares.

47:28.160 --> 47:30.760
Get off me! Don't touch me!

47:30.840 --> 47:34.520
Get off me! Get off me!

47:40.760 --> 47:42.330
Fuck!

48:18.640 --> 48:19.640
Jesus!

49:00.680 --> 49:02.360
The two boys in the photo,

49:02.440 --> 49:04.249
they were found dead near Saddle Mills

49:04.360 --> 49:05.850
with their faces mutilated.

49:07.520 --> 49:11.520
- They were swarmed by black wasps.
- What?

49:11.600 --> 49:15.207
Tyler, I know you could get in trouble
for this, but, please, can you...

49:16.520 --> 49:18.409
Can you access her records somehow,

49:19.120 --> 49:22.040
like a family contact or a last address?

49:22.120 --> 49:23.360
Something?

49:23.960 --> 49:26.281
- We don't even know her last name.
- Nedifar.

49:27.400 --> 49:28.925
Marina Nedifar.

50:16.600 --> 50:17.965
Laura?

52:01.520 --> 52:02.885
Hello?

52:05.160 --> 52:06.685
Hello?

52:07.200 --> 52:08.770
Is anybody here?

52:11.360 --> 52:12.771
Hello!

53:02.040 --> 53:04.486
This is not real. This is not real.

53:09.480 --> 53:11.289
Oh, God. Oh, God.

53:11.400 --> 53:13.040
This is not real.

53:13.120 --> 53:14.610
This is not real! No!

53:48.640 --> 53:50.483
Miss Woodson?

53:56.280 --> 53:57.805
Hello?

54:10.160 --> 54:12.845
She rips out her own hair
before she slits her throat.

54:14.000 --> 54:15.365
Now, I've been on this job 25 years,

54:15.520 --> 54:17.045
and that's a first for me.

54:17.840 --> 54:19.683
There some shitty new drug
we don't know about?

54:20.480 --> 54:22.130
They never took anything.

54:22.720 --> 54:26.361
What I want to know is, where you got
the elevator footage that you posted.

54:28.320 --> 54:33.008
For the last time,
I'm not posting any of this.

54:34.320 --> 54:35.560
Well, the good news for you is

54:35.680 --> 54:38.206
we can't link your IP address
to any of these videos.

54:38.520 --> 54:42.408
We couldn't find any address at all,
which doesn't make any sense,

54:42.520 --> 54:45.091
unless you're familiar
with our IT department.

54:49.480 --> 54:51.244
It all has to do with this girl.

54:51.880 --> 54:54.565
You really know a lot of dead people,
Miss Woodson.

54:58.040 --> 54:59.849
This is not real!

56:51.320 --> 56:54.164
I don't think this was a suicide, Laura.

56:54.280 --> 56:55.645
I think it was a ritual.

56:56.440 --> 57:00.525
Erm, that, what you're looking at here,
these are, these are black mirrors.

57:00.840 --> 57:03.366
They've been used in the occult
for thousands of years.

57:03.840 --> 57:06.810
And they say that if you,
if you stare into it,

57:07.400 --> 57:10.960
you can communicate with some other side.

57:11.040 --> 57:13.361
It's called scrying.

57:14.320 --> 57:16.368
But sometimes these witches,

57:16.640 --> 57:19.160
if they were being hunted,
if they didn't have any other...

57:19.240 --> 57:20.321
Any other way out,

57:20.720 --> 57:22.440
they would hang and burn themselves

57:22.520 --> 57:24.841
in front of a black mirror
and become something else.

57:25.320 --> 57:27.687
You call it whatever you want,
an evil spirit...

57:28.680 --> 57:30.364
Erm, a, a demon.

57:32.520 --> 57:34.680
Point is, it's how
they got revenge on people.

57:34.760 --> 57:37.889
Possessing them and, and
haunting them and killing them.

57:39.200 --> 57:40.406
How'd they ever stop it?

57:42.200 --> 57:44.567
It says they had to find
the original mirror,

57:45.360 --> 57:48.409
the one they burnt themself in front of,
and destroy it.

57:50.000 --> 57:53.368
You mean... Her laptop.

57:53.760 --> 57:55.569
It was her black mirror.

57:56.560 --> 57:58.767
We need to find out
where she killed herself.

58:46.800 --> 58:48.131
What?

59:27.480 --> 59:30.609
I mean, there...
There has to be something here.

59:31.560 --> 59:33.642
You know, something that can help us.

59:36.120 --> 59:37.645
I think I'm going home.

59:40.680 --> 59:42.125
I can't handle this.

59:43.120 --> 59:45.487
I'm so sorry for everything.

59:46.080 --> 59:47.160
Please don't go.

59:47.240 --> 59:48.765
I'm sorry.

59:54.000 --> 59:55.331
I can't.

01:00:07.040 --> 01:00:10.283
- Way to pay your respects!
- Seriously. You're disgusting.

01:00:19.360 --> 01:00:21.886
You're late.

01:00:46.480 --> 01:00:48.801
Why is everyone talking about you?
What have you done to this girl?

01:00:49.720 --> 01:00:52.690
I haven't done anything to her!
She just...

01:00:53.040 --> 01:00:54.724
Attached herself to me.

01:00:56.520 --> 01:00:58.204
Now everyone thinks that...

01:00:58.720 --> 01:01:01.080
Please, I want you home, baby.
You're coming home with me.

01:01:01.160 --> 01:01:04.528
Well, I can't, I can't.
I have to stay and figure it out.

01:01:04.760 --> 01:01:06.000
Figure what out?

01:01:08.040 --> 01:01:10.080
...others suffered serious injuries.

01:01:10.160 --> 01:01:13.403
Police have a suspect in custody,
but are not releasing any information

01:01:13.560 --> 01:01:15.927
until they complete their investigation.

01:01:16.040 --> 01:01:17.451
Moore's Grove.

01:01:18.520 --> 01:01:20.727
It's a deserted farm town
about two hours away.

01:01:21.440 --> 01:01:25.840
There was a fire there 20 years ago.
It's some weird commune.

01:01:25.920 --> 01:01:27.680
Marina's mother, Ada Nedifar, lived there,

01:01:27.760 --> 01:01:29.922
until somebody burned
the whole place down.

01:01:31.920 --> 01:01:33.126
What?

01:01:33.440 --> 01:01:34.965
They kept some...

01:01:35.760 --> 01:01:37.205
Husk of her body alive

01:01:38.520 --> 01:01:40.363
until Marina was delivered.

01:01:42.680 --> 01:01:44.444
She was alone in the womb for months.

01:01:46.200 --> 01:01:47.964
Jesus. She was always alone.

01:01:51.880 --> 01:01:54.087
Do you think this is where
she went to kill herself?

01:01:54.760 --> 01:01:56.603
I mean, it's the only lead we have.

01:02:01.600 --> 01:02:04.331
What's going on with her profile?
What's that on there?

01:04:02.720 --> 01:04:05.360
Hey, it's Olivia. Leave me a thing.

01:04:05.440 --> 01:04:06.930
Something's wrong. Something's wrong.

01:04:09.400 --> 01:04:10.526
Stop right here.

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:14.840
Stop right here and let me out.

01:04:14.920 --> 01:04:16.445
Oh, my God!

01:04:17.440 --> 01:04:19.363
Oh, my God.

01:04:21.400 --> 01:04:22.526
Olivia! Olivia!

01:04:23.120 --> 01:04:24.724
Olivia!

01:04:26.440 --> 01:04:27.805
Get out, get out. Help her!

01:04:28.280 --> 01:04:29.566
- Help her!
- Help me.

01:04:51.800 --> 01:04:54.400
She's stable. That's what matters.

01:04:54.480 --> 01:04:57.165
Thank you so much, Doctor.
I appreciate it.

01:04:59.640 --> 01:05:02.484
She's stable.
She might actually make it through this.

01:05:05.480 --> 01:05:07.289
Even if she does...

01:05:08.440 --> 01:05:10.602
Marina's never gonna stop.

01:05:14.440 --> 01:05:15.487
Shit.

01:05:16.640 --> 01:05:18.165
Just... Just stay here.

01:05:18.440 --> 01:05:21.091
Stay with Liv. Please.
Don't let her be alone.

01:05:22.320 --> 01:05:23.651
Where are you going?

01:05:31.800 --> 01:05:33.086
Whoa.

01:05:33.800 --> 01:05:35.006
Someone had a rough day.

01:05:40.280 --> 01:05:41.850
What happens if there are still
people living there?

01:05:42.480 --> 01:05:44.209
I mean, what is this place now?

01:05:44.640 --> 01:05:45.801
I don't know.

01:05:46.600 --> 01:05:50.207
No matter what, I'm finding that laptop,
I'm gonna fucking smash it.

01:05:51.520 --> 01:05:52.885
- Kobe...
- Yeah?

01:05:55.320 --> 01:05:58.369
- Thanks for coming with me.
- Who says I'm doing it for you?

01:06:03.680 --> 01:06:05.205
Where the hell are you?

01:06:05.680 --> 01:06:07.728
The cops are asking me
a million questions.

01:06:08.640 --> 01:06:10.881
I'm... I'm going to Moore's Grove,
I'm sorry.

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:12.047
Don't go there alone.

01:06:13.160 --> 01:06:15.128
I... I'm not alone. I'm...

01:06:15.240 --> 01:06:16.571
I'm with Kobe.

01:06:20.240 --> 01:06:21.571
I'm coming to meet you.

01:06:22.720 --> 01:06:24.848
So, where is she?

01:06:26.080 --> 01:06:27.923
I don't know, man. Bad reception.

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:30.206
- Yeah.
- All right.

01:06:30.520 --> 01:06:31.567
Keep trying.

01:07:02.120 --> 01:07:03.360
Shit.

01:07:16.800 --> 01:07:18.290
- Charming.
- Yeah.

01:07:23.360 --> 01:07:24.646
Thanks.

01:07:28.240 --> 01:07:30.242
Shit. There's no service.

01:07:31.800 --> 01:07:34.804
What are you so fucking
nervous about? You're gonna be fine.

01:07:36.880 --> 01:07:38.120
What are you talking about?

01:07:39.360 --> 01:07:41.640
You said she wants to make you lonely.

01:07:41.720 --> 01:07:44.769
If that's true, then you are
the only one that's safe.

01:07:52.720 --> 01:07:54.404
Oh, hey, sweetheart.

01:08:01.040 --> 01:08:02.485
I said no.

01:08:03.200 --> 01:08:04.440
No Chinese food.

01:08:04.960 --> 01:08:06.000
Mmm-mmm, no.

01:08:06.080 --> 01:08:08.321
No, no, no. I said no Chinese.

01:08:22.479 --> 01:08:24.243
No Chinese. I said n...

01:08:26.640 --> 01:08:29.319
Sure, yeah. No, I mean, we...
We could have Chinese. I...

01:08:29.399 --> 01:08:30.845
From down...

01:08:30.960 --> 01:08:32.644
No, down... The one by the...

01:08:33.200 --> 01:08:34.645
Yeah, I'll call you back.

01:08:45.960 --> 01:08:48.279
Please, please, please.

01:08:48.359 --> 01:08:49.840
No, I don't want to die.

01:08:49.920 --> 01:08:51.081
Please.

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:02.649
Oh, my God.

01:09:07.399 --> 01:09:08.560
Really?

01:10:13.080 --> 01:10:14.570
Oh, my God.

01:10:34.760 --> 01:10:36.000
Laura?

01:11:15.200 --> 01:11:16.440
- Kobe?
- What?

01:11:18.720 --> 01:11:19.846
She's not here.

01:11:20.680 --> 01:11:22.045
Did you check the basement?

01:11:23.320 --> 01:11:24.367
What basement?

01:12:55.080 --> 01:12:56.525
Kobe?

01:13:03.160 --> 01:13:04.491
Kobe?

01:13:07.480 --> 01:13:08.641
Kobe?

01:13:16.200 --> 01:13:17.361
Kobe.

01:13:38.120 --> 01:13:39.645
What's wrong?

01:13:45.760 --> 01:13:46.807
I'm sorry.

01:13:47.800 --> 01:13:49.404
She can't make you lonely if you're dead.

01:14:13.360 --> 01:14:14.805
Laura!

01:14:21.640 --> 01:14:22.880
Laura?

01:14:24.360 --> 01:14:26.362
Hey, it's Laura. Leave a message.

01:16:27.840 --> 01:16:29.280
What do you mean,
you don't know where she is?

01:16:29.360 --> 01:16:30.680
What happened back there?

01:16:30.760 --> 01:16:32.120
Hey, dum-dum, I'm fucking talking to you!

01:16:32.200 --> 01:16:33.760
What happened?

01:16:36.600 --> 01:16:39.840
Listen to me. If you touched her,
I'll fucking kill you.

01:16:39.920 --> 01:16:40.960
Now where the hell is she?

01:16:41.040 --> 01:16:42.929
She's absolutely fine!

01:16:43.560 --> 01:16:45.244
We are completely fucked.

01:16:46.200 --> 01:16:47.600
She's just peachy.

01:16:52.200 --> 01:16:53.361
Tyler.

01:16:53.840 --> 01:16:55.080
Laura, thank God.

01:16:55.200 --> 01:16:56.520
I thought something happened to you.

01:16:56.600 --> 01:16:58.409
I... I just texted you an address.

01:16:59.200 --> 01:17:00.247
Laura...

01:17:00.360 --> 01:17:02.800
- The factory at Saddle Mills.
- I can't hear you. You're breaking up.

01:17:06.640 --> 01:17:07.880
Tyler?

01:17:12.640 --> 01:17:16.122
Are you sure you don't want me
to take you to a hospital?

01:17:17.040 --> 01:17:18.929
Take me to the factory.

01:18:02.280 --> 01:18:04.931
Still think we can beat this, don't you?

01:18:05.440 --> 01:18:06.487
Shut up, man.

01:18:07.680 --> 01:18:09.170
Seriously.

01:18:09.840 --> 01:18:12.764
You got no idea what we're dealing with.

01:18:14.760 --> 01:18:16.649
I do. I saw where we're headed.

01:18:16.760 --> 01:18:18.280
- Shut up, man!
- I fucking saw it!

01:18:18.360 --> 01:18:20.681
- Shut up!
- You tell me you're going to die for her!

01:18:22.200 --> 01:18:24.487
Cos we've all been dying for her!

01:18:33.280 --> 01:18:34.520
Stay in the car, man.

01:20:03.040 --> 01:20:04.610
Mom?

01:20:06.400 --> 01:20:09.563
Laura, where have you been?
I can't reach you.

01:20:10.600 --> 01:20:11.931
Mom, are you OK?

01:20:12.160 --> 01:20:14.242
I'm seeing things, Laura.

01:20:14.400 --> 01:20:15.890
I keep seeing that girl.

01:20:16.280 --> 01:20:17.645
I'm sorry.

01:20:18.760 --> 01:20:20.125
It's my fault.

01:20:20.320 --> 01:20:22.561
What's happening to us?

01:20:22.920 --> 01:20:25.924
Listen to me. I'm not going to let
anything happen to you.

01:20:26.480 --> 01:20:28.160
I'm going to sort this out somehow.

01:20:28.240 --> 01:20:30.447
I'm going to stop this somehow.

01:20:31.480 --> 01:20:32.766
Mom?

01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:36.002
- Mom? Mom!
- I want to protect you.

01:20:39.400 --> 01:20:40.606
Mom!

01:20:44.920 --> 01:20:46.081
Mom!

01:20:47.680 --> 01:20:48.920
Mom!

01:21:07.120 --> 01:21:08.360
Laura?

01:21:10.120 --> 01:21:11.326
Laura!

01:21:12.440 --> 01:21:13.805
Tyler.

01:21:17.040 --> 01:21:18.121
Tyler.

01:21:27.400 --> 01:21:29.562
I was so worried about you.

01:21:31.640 --> 01:21:33.640
Laura? Hey.

01:21:33.720 --> 01:21:35.006
Laura.

01:21:35.160 --> 01:21:36.525
Look at me.

01:21:37.640 --> 01:21:39.483
My mom, she's...

01:21:39.720 --> 01:21:41.165
Jesus.

01:21:41.800 --> 01:21:43.484
What happened to you?

01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:56.161
Hi.

01:23:21.560 --> 01:23:23.961
What do you want from me?

01:23:28.880 --> 01:23:31.451
What else do you want from me?

01:24:14.080 --> 01:24:17.323
I just want to be friends, Laura.

01:24:19.080 --> 01:24:20.605
Best friends.

01:24:24.960 --> 01:24:26.325
Forever.

01:24:59.480 --> 01:25:01.369
Laura.

01:25:03.520 --> 01:25:05.010
Laura.

01:25:08.840 --> 01:25:10.569
Come to me.

01:25:16.640 --> 01:25:18.529
Come to me.

01:25:22.240 --> 01:25:23.685
Come to me.
