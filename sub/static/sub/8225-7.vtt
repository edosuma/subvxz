WEBVTT

00:01.070 --> 00:04.390
Please, don't try anything you're about to see at home.

00:04.760 --> 00:06.400
We're what you call experts.

00:08.280 --> 00:12.050
On this bigger-is-better episode of "Mythbusters",

00:14.020 --> 00:16.309
The team takes four fan favorites

00:16.370 --> 00:18.380
to infinity and beyond.

00:18.460 --> 00:19.460
"X" marks the spot.

00:19.640 --> 00:20.710
That's where we're aiming for.

00:20.710 --> 00:23.430
First, can Adam and Jamie whip up a weapon

00:23.550 --> 00:24.690
from a water heater?

00:25.120 --> 00:27.770
Favorite thing to blow up, right here!

00:28.640 --> 00:30.610
Then, will they make the earth move

00:30.610 --> 00:32.090
with earth movers?

00:32.090 --> 00:33.090
I'm Jamie Hyneman,

00:33.160 --> 00:36.140
and I'm gonna thread a needle with an excavator.

00:36.140 --> 00:36.940
Whoa! Stop!

00:37.090 --> 00:39.050
Meanwhile, Tory, Grant, and Kari

00:39.180 --> 00:40.950
turn into rocket scientists...

00:40.950 --> 00:43.000
I think we got a winning design here.

00:43.000 --> 00:46.240
to see if a flight by fireworks is really possible.

00:46.240 --> 00:48.770
Keep your hands inside the vehicle at all times.

00:48.770 --> 00:49.640
And finally,

00:49.760 --> 00:53.870
the team flings some bling in bird balance 2.0...

00:53.870 --> 00:55.160
All we need now are some supermodels.

00:55.160 --> 00:58.290
as they find out if a longer limo can give them

00:58.290 --> 01:00.380
the cliffhanger ending they need.

01:00.390 --> 01:01.850
Look at the back end!

01:01.860 --> 01:03.240
It's coming off the ground!

01:05.970 --> 01:07.840
Who are the mythbusters?

01:09.000 --> 01:10.140
Adam Savage...

01:10.260 --> 01:11.890
Eating food cooked with C4.

01:11.980 --> 01:13.200
And Jamie Hyneman.

01:15.140 --> 01:19.240
Between them, more than 30 years of special-effects experience.

01:19.700 --> 01:21.390
Together with Kari Byron,

01:21.550 --> 01:22.630
Right tool for the job.

01:22.730 --> 01:23.520
Tory Belleci...

01:23.710 --> 01:25.260
We only have one shot at this.

01:25.260 --> 01:26.640
and Grant Imahara.

01:26.980 --> 01:28.870
That was a great result!

01:29.110 --> 01:30.780
They don't just tell the myths.

01:32.200 --> 01:34.400
They put them to the test.

01:40.160 --> 01:42.270
Buckle up, because on "Mythbusters",

01:47.070 --> 01:47.880
What's that about?

01:48.070 --> 01:50.790
In this episode, we are working off suggestions

01:50.790 --> 01:52.260
from fans for stuff that we've already done

01:52.260 --> 01:53.850
that we didn't necessarily mess up,

01:54.290 --> 01:57.670
but they have a suggestion of a way we can bump it up a level,

01:57.750 --> 01:58.670
ramp it way up.

01:58.670 --> 01:59.280
Like what?

01:59.570 --> 02:00.550
Hot-water heaters.

02:00.720 --> 02:02.780
Fans love it when we blow them up,

02:02.910 --> 02:05.200
and they've noticed that they make fantastic rockets

02:05.200 --> 02:07.310
when you point them vertically.

02:07.640 --> 02:09.180
But now they want to know what happens

02:09.180 --> 02:11.350
if we point them horizontally.

02:11.490 --> 02:14.120
What kind of cannon would a hot-water heater make?

02:14.480 --> 02:15.100
I like that.

02:15.230 --> 02:17.250
All we have to do is take one out to the bomb range,

02:17.250 --> 02:19.120
strap it down, shoot it at something

02:19.200 --> 02:21.470
and see what kind of mayhem it causes.

02:21.520 --> 02:23.340
That's exactly what I was thinking.

02:23.880 --> 02:26.890
Ever since the first tank turned torpedo,

02:27.150 --> 02:29.830
water heaters have become a "Mythbusters" Favorite.

02:31.790 --> 02:34.300
And the new fan request is this --

02:35.410 --> 02:39.530
if you replace a vertical launch with a horizontal one,

02:40.350 --> 02:42.340
can you really create a cannon?

02:44.720 --> 02:47.750
To find out, the guys wash up at the bomb range

02:47.750 --> 02:49.810
armed with their weapon of choice.

02:50.290 --> 02:51.370
So, how do you want to set this thing up?

02:51.600 --> 02:52.780
Well, if the fans want to see

02:52.780 --> 02:54.440
a water heater made into a cannon,

02:54.440 --> 02:56.120
I guess we got to lie this thing on its side.

02:56.210 --> 02:57.810
And if we're going to shoot it on its side,

02:57.810 --> 03:00.960
I feel really strongly that we need to shoot it at something.

03:01.220 --> 03:03.600
Well, you want to go and find something to shoot at,

03:03.670 --> 03:04.800
and I'll set this up?

03:04.930 --> 03:05.900
I think it's a great plan.

03:07.340 --> 03:09.760
It's a divide-and-conquer-type plan

03:09.820 --> 03:11.770
that sees Jamie getting to grips

03:11.770 --> 03:13.820
with their pressure vessel in waiting.

03:14.330 --> 03:16.050
We've set off these water heaters before,

03:16.200 --> 03:17.700
and we've learned a couple of things.

03:17.700 --> 03:19.220
The first and most important

03:19.250 --> 03:22.270
is that you always want to be able to abort.

03:22.270 --> 03:24.590
I think we're losing pressure somewhere we can't see.

03:24.590 --> 03:25.530
We've just got to abort.

03:25.580 --> 03:27.110
All right. Well, I'll pull the valve.

03:28.700 --> 03:30.980
Sometimes things don't work the way you plan.

03:30.980 --> 03:32.370
So, in this case,

03:32.870 --> 03:35.150
we've got a valve that we can open like so,

03:35.160 --> 03:36.710
and that'll relieve the pressure.

03:37.040 --> 03:38.060
The other thing that we've done

03:38.430 --> 03:40.910
is that we've put a couple of pressure sensors here

03:41.000 --> 03:43.610
so we'll always know exactly what's in this tank,

03:43.610 --> 03:44.760
and we won't approach it

03:44.760 --> 03:46.950
unless these things are saying zero

03:47.300 --> 03:48.730
or unless we've opened the valve.

03:49.120 --> 03:50.320
So, that's the cannon...

03:50.950 --> 03:52.710
and here's the cannon fodder.

03:53.060 --> 03:55.440
Yep, Adam's become the man with a van.

03:56.140 --> 03:57.620
I know it's big and red,

03:57.620 --> 03:59.490
so it's kind of like hitting the broad side of the barn,

03:59.490 --> 04:01.560
but that's not gonna stop me from making a target,

04:01.560 --> 04:02.980
'cause targets are pretty.

04:03.560 --> 04:05.260
And with the target taking shape,

04:05.350 --> 04:07.130
that just leaves the lock and load,

04:07.440 --> 04:08.990
a process which starts

04:08.990 --> 04:11.050
with the addition of 30 gallons of water...

04:12.190 --> 04:15.210
My favorite things to blow up, right here!

04:15.500 --> 04:18.180
and ends with the unit being hammered into place.

04:19.310 --> 04:20.130
We're solid.

04:21.060 --> 04:23.270
With a mini bulldozer parked in place

04:23.270 --> 04:24.830
to further contain the cannon,

04:24.980 --> 04:26.350
the heater gets powered up.

04:27.180 --> 04:28.280
Shall I walk you through

04:28.280 --> 04:29.590
exactly what's gonna go down here?

04:31.200 --> 04:34.210
Actually, I think it's pretty clear what's gonna go down here!

04:34.670 --> 04:35.790
I think my work is done.

04:37.630 --> 04:38.860
But for any of you at home

04:38.880 --> 04:41.590
worried your water heater might also go ballistic,

04:42.100 --> 04:43.430
here's some reassurance.

04:44.470 --> 04:46.520
Why doesn't this happen in your house every day?

04:46.820 --> 04:48.600
Quite frankly, because they've designed it not to.

04:48.660 --> 04:49.680
And here's how.

04:50.010 --> 04:51.570
First, they don't restrict

04:51.740 --> 04:54.340
either the inlet or the outlet ports of the hot-water heater,

04:54.340 --> 04:56.630
so that's one place the overpressure can go.

04:56.950 --> 04:58.900
Secondly, there's a thermostat in here,

04:58.990 --> 05:01.630
which, when the hot-water heater's temperature gets too high,

05:02.030 --> 05:03.800
shuts off the power to both heating elements

05:03.970 --> 05:05.600
until the water heater cools down.

05:06.000 --> 05:07.310
Thirdly, and perhaps most importantly,

05:07.310 --> 05:09.750
is right here, when you install a hot-water heater,

05:09.750 --> 05:12.330
you must install an overpressure-relief valve.

05:12.440 --> 05:14.730
That means when the pressure in here gets too high,

05:15.040 --> 05:17.810
it goes -- and releases the water,

05:17.830 --> 05:20.080
thus releasing the pressure from the cannister.

05:20.770 --> 05:21.590
Needless to say,

05:21.660 --> 05:24.890
the mythbusters have disabled all of those features,

05:25.080 --> 05:27.450
which is why they've gone to hunker in the bunker.

05:27.980 --> 05:29.380
All we do now is wait.

05:29.380 --> 05:31.240
It's about halfway there, about 150 psi.

05:32.170 --> 05:33.130
I love this part.

05:33.660 --> 05:34.430
This kills me.

05:35.590 --> 05:38.330
From past experience, Adam and Jamie know that

05:38.330 --> 05:43.070
there's no blow until the pressure goes beyond 300 psi.

05:45.010 --> 05:46.500
And 40 minutes later...

05:46.810 --> 05:48.330
305 psi.

05:49.070 --> 05:50.570
They're right in that butter zone.

05:52.000 --> 05:58.074

06:05.010 --> 06:06.350
That was awesome!

06:06.480 --> 06:07.220
That was.

06:07.220 --> 06:08.250
I truely totally

06:08.250 --> 06:10.350
did not expect we would knock over that truck.

06:10.350 --> 06:11.610
In fact, I would have bet against it.

06:12.020 --> 06:14.110
And we wheelied the little earth-moving machine.

06:15.820 --> 06:17.720
Like a geyser on steroids,

06:17.800 --> 06:21.290
the power of the cannon has quite literally blown the van away.

06:22.500 --> 06:24.920
And a closer inspection of the damage reveals

06:25.020 --> 06:27.480
just how forceful their firearm was.

06:28.970 --> 06:30.800
I found our projectile.

06:33.340 --> 06:35.500
That's the bottom of the hot-water heater casing.

06:38.060 --> 06:39.590
And that -- ooh, it's hot!

06:41.370 --> 06:43.750
That's the bottom of our hot-water heater cannister.

06:44.790 --> 06:47.060
With debris strewn far and wide...

06:47.380 --> 06:48.930
That was the windshield.

06:49.350 --> 06:51.470
it's definitely mission accomplished.

06:51.850 --> 06:54.220
But that's given Adam and Jamie an idea.

06:54.980 --> 06:57.560
Dude, it threw our van on its side,

06:57.560 --> 06:59.780
and it weighs 5,000 pounds.

06:59.780 --> 07:00.850
I would not have called that.

07:01.090 --> 07:02.970
Well, our little loader weighed 6,000,

07:02.980 --> 07:04.490
and it popped a wheelie,

07:04.490 --> 07:07.560
as well as this has maybe a ton of lumber underneath it.

07:07.620 --> 07:09.700
So it moved like 12,000 pounds of stuff,

07:09.760 --> 07:10.920
all from boiling water.

07:10.950 --> 07:12.380
It's a pretty effective cannon.

07:12.550 --> 07:13.730
Yeah, but you know what?

07:13.940 --> 07:15.170
I think we can do better.

07:15.400 --> 07:16.290
I think you're right.

07:16.940 --> 07:20.260
Well, that's what the mythbusters are gunning for next.

07:26.720 --> 07:28.790
Next up, a blast from the past.

07:30.930 --> 07:31.900
Okay, so, what have we got?

07:32.190 --> 07:33.780
Well, you guys remember fireworks man, right?

07:33.780 --> 07:36.130
Yeah. That was, like, one of the best stories we've ever done.

07:36.210 --> 07:38.630
Well, get ready for fireworks man: the revenge,

07:38.730 --> 07:41.360
because fans want us to give this one another try.

07:41.540 --> 07:43.770
To see if we can get a successful launch?

07:43.860 --> 07:44.520
Exactly.

07:45.710 --> 07:48.810
Fireworks man told the story of a pyro pilot

07:48.820 --> 07:52.980
who flew 150 feet courtesy of 500 skyrockets.

07:54.110 --> 07:56.910
But when Kari, Tory, and Grant put it to the test...

07:59.170 --> 08:01.770
their small-scale flight wasn't promising.

08:02.280 --> 08:04.130
And their large-scale launch...

08:08.230 --> 08:09.540
was even worse.

08:10.910 --> 08:13.970
But fans want this tall tale tackled again.

08:16.560 --> 08:17.980
Okay, so, people were disappointed

08:17.980 --> 08:19.730
with our flight vehicle the first time around,

08:19.730 --> 08:21.790
arguing that if it were a little more slick,

08:21.920 --> 08:23.790
it would have gone the mythical 150 feet.

08:23.800 --> 08:25.490
I get that, but let's not forget that

08:25.490 --> 08:27.280
this was something the guy built in his garage.

08:27.280 --> 08:29.930
It was never gonna be some carbon-fiber,

08:29.980 --> 08:31.300
super-aerodynamic thing.

08:31.410 --> 08:33.100
Right, but that's what the fans want.

08:33.210 --> 08:35.620
This time, they want something a little more sophisticated.

08:35.799 --> 08:38.650
All right, why don't we figure out what we did wrong last time,

08:38.750 --> 08:40.150
fix it in small scale,

08:40.150 --> 08:41.190
and then take it to full scale?

08:41.380 --> 08:44.740
But this time, let's throw some heavy-duty rocket science into it.

08:44.960 --> 08:45.720
NASA?

08:45.820 --> 08:46.620
Yeah!

08:48.270 --> 08:50.940
So, step one in fireworks man 2

08:51.140 --> 08:52.910
is to work out what went wrong.

08:53.230 --> 08:55.190
And Grant's already got that sorted.

08:55.190 --> 08:56.640
So, the first time we tried this,

08:56.640 --> 08:58.060
we had two problems.

08:58.060 --> 09:01.930
One, the curvature of the surfboard caused lift,

09:01.930 --> 09:04.130
which caused us to exit the ramp early.

09:04.460 --> 09:06.940
Second problem, buster's center of gravity,

09:06.940 --> 09:08.320
which is this line right here,

09:08.720 --> 09:11.480
is above the center of thrust,

09:11.480 --> 09:12.770
which is this line right here.

09:12.970 --> 09:14.400
Now, for maximum stability,

09:14.660 --> 09:17.160
those two should be right on top of each other.

09:17.380 --> 09:20.310
In charge of making those improvements is Tory...

09:21.240 --> 09:24.870
who not only addresses the two pivotal flight-path problems...

09:25.080 --> 09:27.050
"Oh, Tory, that's amazing!"

09:27.270 --> 09:28.160
"Aw, thanks, Kari."

09:28.360 --> 09:31.520
but also adds a couple of stability upgrades of his own.

09:32.160 --> 09:33.960
All right, so, these are the changes that I've made.

09:34.440 --> 09:35.850
I've lowered the center of mass,

09:35.850 --> 09:38.030
so that it is in line with the center of thrust.

09:38.030 --> 09:41.760
Plus, I've added a nose cone to make it more aerodynamic.

09:41.930 --> 09:44.940
I'm also adding larger stabilization fin.

09:45.200 --> 09:46.820
The last time, our fins were too small,

09:46.820 --> 09:47.840
and it went out of control.

09:47.970 --> 09:49.310
So, now that the model is done,

09:49.340 --> 09:50.700
we're gonna take it to the wind tunnel

09:50.810 --> 09:53.240
and see if this is aerodynamic enough.

09:53.640 --> 09:55.040
It's kind of like "Men in black"?

09:55.520 --> 09:59.210
Once inside, they pivot their model at its center of gravity.

09:59.320 --> 10:00.300
It's looking great.

10:00.680 --> 10:03.510
If the model stays put when the wind test starts,

10:03.660 --> 10:05.490
then their design is stable.

10:05.850 --> 10:09.010
But any deviation, and it's back to the drawing board.

10:09.100 --> 10:10.070
All right. We're set.

10:10.680 --> 10:12.770
Okay. Let's turn on the wind tunnel and see what happens.

10:13.500 --> 10:14.830
Bring on the wind!

10:15.760 --> 10:18.640
Under the watchful eye of expert Steve Smith,

10:18.810 --> 10:20.790
the 50-knot wind gets fired up.

10:21.860 --> 10:23.470
But their hopes go down.

10:23.680 --> 10:24.360
Pretty stable.

10:24.370 --> 10:25.350
Steady as a rock.

10:25.350 --> 10:26.360
- Wait, wait...  - Fireworks...

10:28.190 --> 10:29.370
That's what happened last time.

10:29.370 --> 10:30.280
All right.

10:30.420 --> 10:33.670
So looks like fireworks man is not stable at all.

10:33.950 --> 10:36.740
Yep. Flipping a 180 and then wobbling in the wind

10:36.850 --> 10:39.130
is about as unstable as it gets.

10:39.800 --> 10:41.830
What if we put the rockets in the back?

10:41.830 --> 10:42.560
That's all I'm saying.

10:43.820 --> 10:46.650
So, we just tested the new design for our fireworks man

10:46.870 --> 10:47.660
in the wind tunnel,

10:47.660 --> 10:50.110
and so far, it is not looking very aerodynamic.

10:50.110 --> 10:51.030
But we're not gonna give up.

10:51.240 --> 10:52.260
We have bigger fins.

10:52.260 --> 10:53.740
Hopefully, that'll give us stability

10:53.750 --> 10:55.860
and that'll be the winning model design.

10:56.230 --> 10:58.480
And with those bigger fins glued in place,

10:58.540 --> 11:00.000
it's time for test two...

11:02.310 --> 11:05.370
where this time, things are looking solid.

11:05.370 --> 11:06.110
It's working.

11:06.200 --> 11:07.020
Looks good.

11:07.070 --> 11:08.750
So, if it really is stable,

11:08.750 --> 11:10.420
we should be able to nudge it a little bit,

11:10.530 --> 11:13.130
and it should restore back to its original flight plot.

11:13.130 --> 11:14.180
Don't nudge it too much.

11:15.820 --> 11:16.680
That's stable.

11:16.840 --> 11:17.760
That's awesome!

11:18.180 --> 11:20.420
I think we got a winning design here.

11:21.250 --> 11:24.380
Still to come, will fireworks man take flight?

11:24.690 --> 11:25.640
"X" marks the spot.

11:25.800 --> 11:26.960
That's where we're aiming for.

11:28.060 --> 11:31.550
But next, Adam and Jamie unleash the big guns.

11:31.550 --> 11:33.420
In 3, 2, 1.

11:35.130 --> 11:36.220
What happened, what happened?

11:43.460 --> 11:45.110
In revenge of the water cannon,

11:46.320 --> 11:48.730
Adam and Jamie have just had a blast.

11:50.850 --> 11:52.290
That was freaking awesome.

11:52.300 --> 11:53.600
Yeah. That was great, wasn't it?

11:53.740 --> 11:56.980
But it wasn't really an honest-to-goodness cannon,

11:56.980 --> 11:58.370
like with a cannonball.

11:58.450 --> 11:59.970
You're right. What are you thinking?

12:00.280 --> 12:01.350
What if we put the water heater

12:01.350 --> 12:04.490
inside a really heavy cannister with a barrel mounted on it?

12:04.630 --> 12:07.340
And let the energy from the exploding hot-water heater

12:07.340 --> 12:11.020
contained by the cannister propel the cannonball forward.

12:11.020 --> 12:11.690
Exactly.

12:13.090 --> 12:16.070
So, now we've seen the awesome power

12:16.070 --> 12:17.170
inherent in the hot-water heater

12:17.170 --> 12:20.220
when you place it on its side, and it's not unimpressive.

12:20.220 --> 12:22.310
In fact, it's pretty incredible.

12:22.650 --> 12:23.920
We tipped a van over.

12:23.920 --> 12:26.100
We knocked a 6,000-pound digger backwards

12:26.160 --> 12:28.940
and lifted 2,000 pounds of railroad ties.

12:29.410 --> 12:30.540
We find ourselves wondering.

12:30.830 --> 12:33.910
What happens if we took all that energy and focus it

12:33.910 --> 12:35.200
and compressed it?

12:35.970 --> 12:37.540
Yeah. That's what we're doing next.

12:37.670 --> 12:40.010
We're going to encase this hot-water heater in steel,

12:40.050 --> 12:42.020
we're gonna focus all this energy out of barrel,

12:42.170 --> 12:43.740
and I think we're gonna come out with

12:43.740 --> 12:45.790
a pretty darned respectable cannon.

12:46.440 --> 12:48.270
So, with the design idea sorted,

12:48.480 --> 12:50.720
you might say it's full steam ahead.

12:50.720 --> 12:51.460
In we go.

12:51.830 --> 12:55.170
First, Jamie dives into the heater-containment section.

12:55.670 --> 12:57.180
It's nice and cozy in here.

12:59.260 --> 13:01.360
Made of half-inch-thick steel pipe,

13:01.480 --> 13:03.060
it should be strong enough,

13:03.200 --> 13:05.170
but Jamie's taken no chances.

13:06.130 --> 13:08.310
We've taken three heavy passes with a welder

13:08.310 --> 13:09.730
on this side of the flange,

13:09.820 --> 13:11.950
and we're gonna do the same on the other side.

13:12.240 --> 13:13.810
It may seem kind of overkill,

13:13.810 --> 13:16.010
but we've seen what these water heaters can do.

13:16.890 --> 13:20.050
Meanwhile, Adam's taken aim with both barrels.

13:20.700 --> 13:21.450
For the barrel,

13:21.500 --> 13:24.520
I'm using two 20-foot lengths of schedule 40 pipe.

13:24.690 --> 13:25.460
That's good.

13:25.660 --> 13:28.150
That 40-foot length should give my cannonball

13:28.180 --> 13:30.650
plenty of time to go as fast as possible.

13:31.540 --> 13:32.580
We have clearance.

13:32.580 --> 13:35.760
We want to harness all of this cannon's steam power.

13:35.960 --> 13:36.710
Indeed.

13:36.750 --> 13:39.120
And after a quick, 40-foot paint job,

13:39.240 --> 13:41.540
Adam's finished lock, stock, and barrel...

13:41.860 --> 13:43.320
I think it looks lovely. Don't you?

13:44.100 --> 13:45.900
which leaves just one thing...

13:46.170 --> 13:48.080
Jamie's base-plate catcher.

13:48.410 --> 13:50.740
So, we're gonna put our water heater inside our cannister

13:50.800 --> 13:52.020
and wait for it to blow.

13:52.300 --> 13:54.920
Now, when it blows its bottom, just like this one,

13:54.920 --> 13:57.090
it's gonna rocket towards the front of the cannister.

13:57.090 --> 13:59.530
But because we don't want it to plug the hole

13:59.540 --> 14:01.200
that lets steam into the barrel,

14:01.590 --> 14:04.000
we've put a heavy, steel plate at the end of the cannister

14:04.000 --> 14:06.560
so that this thing will tilt

14:06.650 --> 14:08.750
and let the steam flow up and over it

14:08.840 --> 14:10.690
and into the barrel without any turbulence.

14:11.180 --> 14:12.460
At least, that's the idea.

14:12.880 --> 14:14.420
It's a good idea in theory,

14:14.450 --> 14:16.160
but will it work in practice?

14:16.470 --> 14:18.080
Well, back at the bomb range,

14:18.080 --> 14:19.980
the steam cannon will have to wait,

14:19.980 --> 14:22.390
because first to fire, is the control.

14:23.070 --> 14:24.930
Before we fire off our steam cannon,

14:25.080 --> 14:26.660
we need to have something to compare it to,

14:26.860 --> 14:29.400
so we've gotten ahold of an honest-to-goodness,

14:29.530 --> 14:33.690
traditional, civil war-era cannon by the name of O Moses.

14:33.730 --> 14:35.590
All we need is something to shoot at.

14:35.930 --> 14:38.480
And that's something Adam's already lined up.

14:39.570 --> 14:40.860
This is our target --

14:41.020 --> 14:44.570
four pallets full of hollow, concrete bricks.

14:44.640 --> 14:45.900
What we're hoping is is the bricks

14:45.910 --> 14:48.190
will have enough stopping power to halt the cannonball

14:48.190 --> 14:50.470
at somewhere along its path within these four pallets

14:50.470 --> 14:51.990
so that we get a nice comparative metric

14:51.990 --> 14:54.370
as how much power the cannon is putting out.

14:54.570 --> 14:55.670
If, for some reason,

14:55.670 --> 14:56.530
the cannonball makes it through

14:56.530 --> 14:58.000
all four of these pallets of bricks,

14:58.240 --> 15:00.100
well, we've got a fifth one filled with sand,

15:00.100 --> 15:01.820
and that is definitely gonna stop it.

15:02.710 --> 15:04.180
All right, everybody, this is for real.

15:04.210 --> 15:10.000
Cannonball, the control, in 3, 2, 1.

15:17.390 --> 15:18.510
I can't see what happened!

15:18.510 --> 15:19.480
What happened, what happened?!

15:20.150 --> 15:21.980
It hit the bricks.

15:22.680 --> 15:24.490
It sure was a direct hit.

15:24.930 --> 15:26.870
But what's important here is not the aim,

15:27.390 --> 15:29.280
but the number of bricks destroyed.

15:29.470 --> 15:32.790
That's the benchmark that their steam cannon will be compared to.

15:33.900 --> 15:35.670
And after surveying the damage...

15:35.870 --> 15:37.210
This is it! I got it!

15:38.630 --> 15:39.640
Yeah. There it is.

15:40.260 --> 15:43.220
those numbers are in, and they're pretty substantial.

15:43.830 --> 15:44.720
So, what have we got?

15:45.070 --> 15:47.330
Well, we had 11 rows penetrated,

15:48.040 --> 15:50.280
37 bricks destroyed,

15:50.550 --> 15:52.530
and 23 knocked off.

15:52.950 --> 15:54.710
That seems like a pretty good metric to start from.

15:55.000 --> 15:57.470
Yeah, well, we'll see what the steam cannon does.

15:59.480 --> 16:02.230
Later, the mythbusters fling some bling.

16:02.800 --> 16:03.790
Unbelievable.

16:03.790 --> 16:06.310
We finally get a luxury car, and what do we do?

16:06.670 --> 16:08.190
We throw it off a cliff.

16:08.330 --> 16:12.490
But next, will fireworks man hit infinity or beyond?

16:12.500 --> 16:14.880
In 3, 2, 1.

16:20.840 --> 16:22.400
At NASA's wind tunnel...

16:22.580 --> 16:23.900
Bring on the wind!

16:24.330 --> 16:27.370
the new and improved fireworks man is riding high...

16:27.480 --> 16:29.720
I think we got a winning design here.

16:30.220 --> 16:32.580
because in a head-to-head stability test,

16:32.690 --> 16:35.970
version 2.0 has trounced their original design.

16:36.140 --> 16:37.320
That's awesome!

16:37.650 --> 16:40.660
So now the team has headed to the middle of nowhere,

16:42.330 --> 16:44.860
for its maiden flight in miniature.

16:45.410 --> 16:46.340
We're here!

16:46.920 --> 16:48.100
Ready for science.

16:48.260 --> 16:51.310
I am so glad we are revisiting fireworks man.

16:51.510 --> 16:53.700
Now we're gonna test our small-scale fireworks man.

16:53.900 --> 16:55.530
So far, we've taken it to NASA,

16:55.530 --> 16:57.300
we've made a more aerodynamic design,

16:57.300 --> 16:59.250
and next we're gonna launch it off into the desert.

17:00.010 --> 17:02.490
Lay down our course with a marker every 10 feet,

17:02.490 --> 17:03.470
up to 200 feet.

17:03.740 --> 17:05.339
This is gonna tell us two things --

17:05.339 --> 17:07.170
one, the distance our model travels,

17:07.170 --> 17:09.480
and, two, if it flies straight,

17:09.579 --> 17:10.750
which hopefully it does.

17:10.750 --> 17:11.880
It's time for launch.

17:14.990 --> 17:18.859
All right, so, we are all loaded, ready to launch.

17:18.869 --> 17:20.490
Okay. Here we go.

17:21.470 --> 17:25.670
Small-scale fireworks man in 3, 2, 1.

17:32.130 --> 17:32.810
Awesome!

17:34.890 --> 17:36.260
I don't know about you guys,

17:36.260 --> 17:38.300
but I would say that's a successful launch.

17:38.300 --> 17:40.480
I mean, that thing went at least 300 feet in the air.

17:40.520 --> 17:43.160
Yeah. I think we got at least 150 feet in distance.

17:43.190 --> 17:44.720
You know, it could have been a little straighter,

17:44.720 --> 17:46.940
but this is definitely worth moving on from.

17:46.940 --> 17:49.100
Yep. I think it's time we take this full scale.

17:51.500 --> 17:54.270
This launch was such a phenomenal success...

17:55.840 --> 17:57.990
that now its big brother beckons.

17:58.500 --> 17:59.370
Let's go to work.

18:00.200 --> 18:01.360
Well, back at the shop,

18:01.380 --> 18:02.530
it's time to get building.

18:03.770 --> 18:06.830
Tory focuses on the full-size flight vehicle,

18:06.880 --> 18:09.080
complete with its large, wooden fins...

18:11.050 --> 18:11.830
That should hold.

18:11.930 --> 18:14.210
and gurney-inspired passenger capsule.

18:18.720 --> 18:21.670
Meanwhile, Grant gives the ramp a revamp.

18:21.880 --> 18:23.170
When we first tried this,

18:23.170 --> 18:24.630
we had a minor problem,

18:24.680 --> 18:26.840
and that was we had a trolley

18:26.870 --> 18:29.660
that our shuttle was riding on all the way up the ramp,

18:29.660 --> 18:31.440
but it separated prematurely.

18:31.500 --> 18:32.980
That is not gonna happen this time,

18:32.980 --> 18:34.410
cause we're doing away with the trolley,

18:34.590 --> 18:39.900
and we are integrating our wheels directly into our launch vehicle.

18:40.300 --> 18:42.530
So it's gonna travel all the way up the ramp,

18:43.070 --> 18:45.230
and by the time it gets to the end,

18:45.300 --> 18:47.650
it should be going fast enough

18:47.650 --> 18:50.720
that the fins take over and we get a straight launch.

18:50.990 --> 18:52.160
That's the theory,

18:52.170 --> 18:54.470
and after a solid day's rocketeering,

18:54.490 --> 18:56.620
it's almost time to put it into practice.

18:57.520 --> 19:00.810
But first comes the all-important test on the ramp...

19:00.810 --> 19:01.860
That's awesome!

19:02.230 --> 19:04.470
and a patented "Mythbusters" Makeover.

19:04.820 --> 19:06.670
Best rocket ever.

19:06.810 --> 19:09.030
And with that, it's time to ship out...

19:09.030 --> 19:11.480
This is gonna be so sick.

19:11.610 --> 19:14.780
to one of the most iconic "Mythbusters" locations of all.

19:15.860 --> 19:18.270
Dude, look at this spot.

19:18.370 --> 19:19.710
I think this is perfect.

19:19.710 --> 19:20.830
We put the ramp right here.

19:20.960 --> 19:23.670
Fireworks man goes launching off into the valley.

19:23.900 --> 19:26.390
I mean, it can't get any better than this!

19:27.330 --> 19:29.870
We're here at a rock quarry in Angel's Camp.

19:29.900 --> 19:31.030
Now, we've been here before.

19:31.070 --> 19:33.060
In fact, we blew up our cement truck here.

19:35.610 --> 19:37.600
We've pushed cars off of cliffs here.

19:40.240 --> 19:43.360
Now we're seeing if over 500 skyrockets

19:43.360 --> 19:46.750
is enough to send a man 150 feet in the air.

19:46.840 --> 19:50.460
It's time to put this myth to the test, again.

19:51.280 --> 19:53.570
But first comes the on-site setup,

19:53.660 --> 19:54.800
starting with the ramp...

19:56.930 --> 19:58.840
All right, why don't you bring that forklift in?

19:59.840 --> 20:01.500
which, once out of the truck,

20:01.600 --> 20:05.150
is raised up to a perfect launch angle of 50 degrees.

20:06.150 --> 20:07.100
A little more!

20:07.770 --> 20:09.220
Stop! All right!

20:09.560 --> 20:10.730
That looks good.

20:10.920 --> 20:12.750
Then the ramp's secured in place

20:12.790 --> 20:15.420
so that it should withstand the full force of launch

20:15.580 --> 20:16.960
without falling over.

20:18.650 --> 20:20.060
This feels pretty solid, man.

20:20.060 --> 20:20.920
I think we're done.

20:21.080 --> 20:22.730
All right. Let's get the fireworks, man.

20:23.330 --> 20:25.880
Next, buster gets dressed for success...

20:26.060 --> 20:26.910
Look at that!

20:29.360 --> 20:31.200
and strapped into the hot seat.

20:31.200 --> 20:32.690
Remember to keep your hands and arms

20:32.690 --> 20:34.750
inside the vehicle at all times.

20:34.750 --> 20:36.420
A quick balance check later...

20:36.500 --> 20:37.580
That's pretty good, right?

20:37.860 --> 20:39.790
and all that's left are the fireworks --

20:39.950 --> 20:41.660
all 500 of them.

20:42.180 --> 20:44.280
So, we're gonna be launching our fireworks man

20:44.280 --> 20:46.400
with this giant bank of skyrockets.

20:46.640 --> 20:48.980
Now, these skyrockets can go up to 1,200 feet,

20:48.980 --> 20:49.920
but that's without load.

20:49.920 --> 20:51.980
We have a 300-pound load.

20:52.140 --> 20:53.680
Now, remember, they only burn for three seconds,

20:53.680 --> 20:55.280
so hopefully that'll give us enough time

20:55.350 --> 20:58.640
to build up enough thrust to get our fireworks man to go

20:58.820 --> 21:01.320
over the 150-foot mark that we're looking for.

21:01.320 --> 21:03.460
This way, we can confirm this myth.

21:03.460 --> 21:05.630
Confidence may be sky-high...

21:05.700 --> 21:06.510
Hey, check it out.

21:06.510 --> 21:07.630
"X" marks the spot.

21:07.630 --> 21:09.090
That's where we're aiming for.

21:09.100 --> 21:11.770
but the team is still taking precautions.

21:11.770 --> 21:14.220
Just to give you an idea how dangerous this experiment is,

21:14.220 --> 21:16.370
We had to bring in a bomb tech, a pyro tech,

21:16.370 --> 21:19.830
the sheriff's department, NASA, and the fire department,

21:19.830 --> 21:21.000
'cause in a few minutes,

21:21.110 --> 21:23.020
we're about to have a flying, flaming,

21:23.020 --> 21:25.700
potentially exploding man go off that ramp.

21:26.210 --> 21:28.420
Here on "Mythbusters," you can't be too careful.

21:28.920 --> 21:30.230
Ain't that the truth.

21:30.960 --> 21:35.510
And with everyone retreated for safety, it's go time.

21:37.100 --> 21:38.470
You guys ready for this?

21:38.550 --> 21:39.460
I think so.

21:41.180 --> 21:42.010
All right. Here we go.

21:42.010 --> 21:46.070
In 3, 2, 1...

21:52.800 --> 21:55.120
Holy crap.

21:58.110 --> 22:01.120
In a complete reversal of their previous effort,

22:01.120 --> 22:05.790
fireworks man flew straight, true, and then some,

22:06.390 --> 22:10.650
crash-landing headfirst 700 feet downstream.

22:10.650 --> 22:12.660
You cannot ask for a better launch.

22:12.750 --> 22:14.590
We had the fireworks man on the ramp.

22:14.590 --> 22:16.520
The rockets all went off at the same exact time,

22:16.520 --> 22:18.320
shot up the ramp.

22:18.320 --> 22:20.170
He went off, went straight,

22:20.170 --> 22:22.360
and all of a sudden fired off like a missile,

22:22.360 --> 22:24.430
going over 150 feet.

22:25.310 --> 22:27.290
We have to confirm this one.

22:27.510 --> 22:28.820
This one was awesome.

22:36.460 --> 22:38.320
So it looks like the adjustments that we made paid off.

22:38.320 --> 22:40.550
I mean, we've got a much stabler flight,

22:40.550 --> 22:41.900
and it went a lot further.

22:41.900 --> 22:43.430
So the physics are confirmed.

22:43.440 --> 22:44.360
Yeah, it's confirmed.

22:44.360 --> 22:45.360
But you know what?

22:45.360 --> 22:47.450
Falling from that height, even into water,

22:47.450 --> 22:49.340
survivability is questionable.

22:49.340 --> 22:50.360
All right. Confirmed.

22:50.360 --> 22:51.690
Just not very smart.

22:51.690 --> 22:52.290
Confirmed.

22:52.290 --> 22:54.120
Yeah. Confirmed, but dangerous.

22:54.330 --> 22:55.940
Don't try that one at home, right?

23:01.040 --> 23:02.340
Next on "Mythbusters,"

23:02.340 --> 23:05.520
will a hot-water heater make a viable cannon?

23:05.520 --> 23:07.010
So cantankerous.

23:08.920 --> 23:12.660
Please do not try what you are about to see at home.

23:12.660 --> 23:14.270
We're what you call experts.

23:14.270 --> 23:15.370
Can't you tell?

23:18.420 --> 23:19.370
At the fans' requests,

23:19.380 --> 23:21.490
we've been looking into harnessing the awesome power

23:21.590 --> 23:23.360
of exploding hot water heaters.

23:25.670 --> 23:27.370
And so far, without any modification,

23:27.370 --> 23:31.670
we got one turned on its side to tip over a 5,000-pound van.

23:33.160 --> 23:34.270
But that's not good enough for us.

23:34.270 --> 23:36.100
We want to make a real cannon.

23:36.100 --> 23:40.770
So this time, we are sealing a hot water heater inside a heavy steel cannister

23:40.770 --> 23:44.060
with nothing but a 37-foot barrel as its outlet.

23:44.070 --> 23:46.440
We've already fired a civil war era cannon to give

23:46.440 --> 23:49.200
ourselves a metric as how powerful a cannon should be.

23:50.890 --> 23:52.700
And we're hoping to exceed that.

23:52.830 --> 23:56.250
Assembly is definitely an "all hands to the pump" affair.

23:56.260 --> 23:58.800
But pretty soon, the cannon's locked...

23:59.040 --> 24:00.280
Okay. Kill it.

24:00.380 --> 24:01.340
loaded...

24:01.800 --> 24:04.040
and zeroed in on the target.

24:04.480 --> 24:05.790
This brick right here?

24:05.970 --> 24:07.500
That's where O Moses hit.

24:07.530 --> 24:09.420
And that's where our steam cannon is aimed.

24:09.420 --> 24:10.190
It's heating up now,

24:10.190 --> 24:14.010
so sometime in about an hour -- well, an hour for me,

24:14.010 --> 24:16.250
more like two minutes for you.

24:16.330 --> 24:18.300
In about two minutes for you,

24:18.750 --> 24:20.410
we're going to obliterate at least

24:20.410 --> 24:23.280
one and a half blocks of concrete bricks.

24:24.400 --> 24:25.680
That's the theory.

24:25.710 --> 24:27.910
But unfortunately, in 20 minutes for Adam

24:27.910 --> 24:29.950
and 20 seconds for you,

24:30.540 --> 24:31.770
there's a problem.

24:32.240 --> 24:35.520
In the realm of not being able to plan for every contingency,

24:35.590 --> 24:38.570
take a note at our cannon down there, the blue and white stripe.

24:38.570 --> 24:39.730
See where it is pointed?

24:40.540 --> 24:42.660
A brush fire has just started on

24:42.660 --> 24:44.700
the other side of the hill where we're aimed.

24:44.760 --> 24:48.100
And we have to stop heating our water heater so it doesn't,

24:48.100 --> 24:49.670
you know, shoot any fireman.

24:50.570 --> 24:52.070
Who would have thought of that?

24:52.400 --> 24:55.670
It's not the fire in the hole they were looking for.

24:58.870 --> 25:01.180
But when the burning bush is brought under control,

25:01.190 --> 25:04.170
the guys ratchet up the pressure once more.

25:04.170 --> 25:06.910
All right, everybody, we're at 150 PSI,

25:06.910 --> 25:10.560
so you can't leave your bunkers, you can't approach the gun.

25:10.560 --> 25:11.580
It's a no-go zone.

25:11.780 --> 25:14.370
This time, the PSI climbs steadily...

25:14.370 --> 25:15.290
210.

25:15.290 --> 25:16.870
just like it's supposed to...

25:16.990 --> 25:17.910
220.

25:17.910 --> 25:22.070
until it reaches 230, where it suddenly stops...

25:23.060 --> 25:25.360
I just don't understand what's going on with this one.

25:25.870 --> 25:27.260
and then drops.

25:28.170 --> 25:29.290
175.

25:29.600 --> 25:33.250
With the tank falling to a pressure that safe to stand next to,

25:33.250 --> 25:35.560
their only option is to trigger the release valve...

25:35.560 --> 25:36.420
Oh, man.

25:36.690 --> 25:37.690
There we go.

25:38.100 --> 25:40.230
and wait for the tank to empty.

25:41.100 --> 25:42.290
It's a rainbow.

25:42.880 --> 25:45.610
It's hardly the cannon chaos they were after,

25:45.610 --> 25:47.990
but failure is always an option.

25:48.210 --> 25:49.890
Well, round one was a failure.

25:49.890 --> 25:53.500
There's no way around it. So we're gonna reset, have another go.

25:58.840 --> 26:03.220
Next in revenge of the myth is another tall story.

26:04.440 --> 26:05.360
Okay, so, what have we got?

26:05.360 --> 26:06.180
Bird balance.

26:06.180 --> 26:07.880
Ah, yeah. That's the one will the bird lands

26:07.880 --> 26:09.740
on the hood of the precariously balanced car,

26:09.740 --> 26:11.140
causing it to tip.

26:11.140 --> 26:12.070
Yes and no.

26:12.080 --> 26:13.990
Yes, that's the myth, but, no, it can't.

26:13.990 --> 26:15.930
Do people dispute that?

26:15.930 --> 26:18.630
No, but they have a good suggestion that they think it's

26:18.630 --> 26:20.390
gonna send this myth to the max.

26:20.390 --> 26:21.130
What's that?

26:21.130 --> 26:22.030
A limo.

26:22.030 --> 26:23.200
Oh, that's a good idea.

26:23.200 --> 26:24.760
A limo's longer than a regular car,

26:24.760 --> 26:27.110
which means the tip of its hood is further from the pivot point.

26:27.110 --> 26:30.390
And therefore it should be easier to send it over the cliff.

26:31.140 --> 26:34.890
The last time the guys tested this classic car cliff hanger...

26:34.890 --> 26:36.890
Two pigeons -- not happening.

26:36.890 --> 26:40.680
only a farmload of poultry could get the car to pivot.

26:45.310 --> 26:49.010
But the longer the lever, the less weight it takes to tip.

26:49.190 --> 26:51.690
So fans have asked if a lengthy limousine

26:51.970 --> 26:54.250
can be unbalanced by a bird.

26:54.350 --> 26:56.470
And that's not their only request.

26:57.590 --> 26:58.260
But there's more.

26:58.260 --> 27:00.500
The fans were not satisfied with our cliff.

27:00.500 --> 27:03.430
They want to see this car go over an actual cliff.

27:03.440 --> 27:05.210
Okay, well, that means real birds are out.

27:05.210 --> 27:06.820
We better start preparing some fake birds.

27:06.820 --> 27:08.160
Yeah, and considering how much mass

27:08.160 --> 27:09.900
it took last time to send the car over,

27:09.900 --> 27:11.000
I'm gonna have to start

27:11.000 --> 27:13.080
building the heaviest flying bird there is.

27:13.250 --> 27:15.260
In case the big bird doesn't work,

27:15.260 --> 27:18.590
I'll build something that will drop large amounts of poultry.

27:19.030 --> 27:19.870
Sounds good.

27:19.880 --> 27:20.940
Sounds weird.

27:21.210 --> 27:22.800
Sounds bird-brained.

27:22.800 --> 27:25.310
But large fake fliers it is.

27:25.550 --> 27:28.040
Now, since we're moving on to a more extreme car,

27:28.040 --> 27:29.460
the limo, it is fitting

27:29.460 --> 27:32.810
that we move on to a larger bird -- a kori bustard.

27:32.810 --> 27:34.690
Now, they are native in Africa.

27:34.690 --> 27:37.390
They are one of the largest birds known to fly,

27:37.390 --> 27:39.070
and they weigh around 40 pounds.

27:39.070 --> 27:41.710
Now, since we don't have them here in North America,

27:41.710 --> 27:42.740
I need to make one.

27:42.740 --> 27:46.720
So, I have a bag of sand that weighs around 40 pounds.

27:46.720 --> 27:48.640
What I need to do is make it look a little bit

27:48.640 --> 27:51.160
more like the bird before we drop it on the limo.

27:51.160 --> 27:54.410
By re-creating the world's heaviest flying bird,

27:54.410 --> 27:57.090
Tory's giving this myth a helping hand.

27:57.770 --> 28:00.210
He's also giving it a helping voice.

28:01.110 --> 28:02.030
What do you think?

28:02.030 --> 28:03.640
Say hello to my robobird.

28:06.720 --> 28:10.460
Tory's avian animatronics is firing on all cylinders...

28:11.280 --> 28:12.480
Good kori bustard.

28:12.480 --> 28:14.780
but it won't be flying solo.

28:16.620 --> 28:19.270
Okay, so I finished the turkey chandelier.

28:19.270 --> 28:22.380
We can drop up to 40 turkeys onto the hood of the car.

28:22.380 --> 28:26.930
At 25 pounds apiece, that's upwards of 1,000 pounds of poultry.

28:27.120 --> 28:27.920
Here we go.

28:27.920 --> 28:28.870
Fire one.

28:29.730 --> 28:30.690
Fire two.

28:31.660 --> 28:32.740
Just like that.

28:34.490 --> 28:36.450
With their bird booty in tow,

28:36.450 --> 28:37.850
the mythbusters head to

28:37.860 --> 28:39.260
the deserts of New Mexico,

28:39.260 --> 28:41.360
where they've travelled in style.

28:42.920 --> 28:47.000
It is about time we get to ride in style on this show!

28:47.000 --> 28:47.700
All right.

28:47.700 --> 28:50.050
I think this is the perfect candidate for our experiment.

28:50.050 --> 28:51.160
Let's push it off a cliff.

28:51.160 --> 28:52.440
It's kind of a shame, don't you think?

28:52.440 --> 28:53.340
Not really.

28:53.340 --> 28:54.860
All we need now are some supermodels.

28:54.860 --> 28:58.050
Well, New Mexico Tech may be short on supermodels,

28:58.050 --> 29:00.230
but for cliffs to balance cars on,

29:00.310 --> 29:01.540
it's ideal.

29:01.930 --> 29:03.600
All right, as you know, I hate heights.

29:03.600 --> 29:05.210
It's not so much the heights that I hate.

29:05.210 --> 29:06.350
It's falling to your death.

29:06.350 --> 29:07.560
That part I hate.

29:07.560 --> 29:09.170
But this myth calls for heights.

29:09.180 --> 29:10.220
We needed a cliff.

29:10.230 --> 29:11.280
And we have the perfect cliff.

29:11.280 --> 29:12.870
This thing is 300 feet tall.

29:12.880 --> 29:14.860
We're gonna balance our limo at the edge

29:14.860 --> 29:16.720
and see if a bird landing on it

29:16.720 --> 29:17.960
will send it over.

29:18.420 --> 29:19.500
I'm getting out of here.

29:19.810 --> 29:21.010
The good news is that

29:21.010 --> 29:23.680
at least Tory won't be in the car when it tips.

29:23.890 --> 29:25.650
Adios, muchachos.

29:25.660 --> 29:26.580
Have a nice trip.

29:26.580 --> 29:27.690
See you next fall.

29:27.690 --> 29:29.440
But with only one limo,

29:29.440 --> 29:32.600
they can't risk losing it before they've even started.

29:32.770 --> 29:35.470
So, first, to find its pivot point.

29:35.630 --> 29:38.140
The plan here is to find the butter zone for the tipping point.

29:38.140 --> 29:40.340
To do that, we have a teeter-totter,

29:40.340 --> 29:42.300
which is a pipe -- it's a rounded edge.

29:42.310 --> 29:44.450
We'll find the center of mass of the limousine

29:44.460 --> 29:45.510
that way and mark it.

29:45.530 --> 29:47.270
All right, mark it.

29:47.270 --> 29:50.240
Then we're gonna lift the limousine up, put it on a slab.

29:50.240 --> 29:53.070
We're gonna find the tipping point off of a knife edge.

29:53.070 --> 29:54.580
All right, looks pretty good.

29:54.580 --> 29:56.130
Somewhere between those two

29:56.130 --> 29:58.390
should be our perfect zone for tipping.

29:58.390 --> 29:59.430
Unbelievable.

29:59.430 --> 30:02.180
We finally get a luxury car, and what do we do?

30:02.180 --> 30:04.070
We throw it off a cliff.

30:04.780 --> 30:08.610
And to do just that, the car is first hoisted into place...

30:08.830 --> 30:09.520
Stop!

30:09.520 --> 30:12.770
and then balanced on its predetermined tipping point.

30:12.840 --> 30:15.110
Remember, this is all about the science of the fulcrum --

30:15.260 --> 30:17.480
The further out we are from the fulcrum,

30:17.480 --> 30:19.310
the easier it is for a small weight

30:19.310 --> 30:21.070
to be able to tip that lever,

30:21.170 --> 30:23.360
and basically tip our car off the cliff.

30:23.360 --> 30:27.000
But will the kori bustard be enough to tip the balance?

30:27.660 --> 30:29.530
The car is perfectly balanced.

30:29.530 --> 30:33.510
We're about to drop our heavy bird -- the single-bird experiment.

30:33.820 --> 30:35.810
I think we actually have a shot at this one.

30:35.810 --> 30:37.580
I think that car's gonna go off the cliff.

30:38.220 --> 30:39.570
All right, you guys ready to do this?

30:39.570 --> 30:41.230
This is the kori bustard,

30:41.250 --> 30:45.380
the heaviest flying bird landing on the front end of the limo.

30:45.640 --> 30:46.930
Okay, here we go...

30:46.930 --> 30:53.340
In 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

30:53.600 --> 30:55.290
Coming up next on "Mythbusters"...

30:55.950 --> 30:57.660
I'm not actually sure.

30:57.840 --> 31:01.490
Plus, Adam and Jamie get exuberant with excavators.

31:01.490 --> 31:02.740
Oh! Stop!

31:03.010 --> 31:04.180
We might have gotten it!

31:10.650 --> 31:14.590
With cannons behaving chaotically, it's time to switch gears.

31:15.000 --> 31:16.910
Remember excavator exuberance?

31:16.910 --> 31:18.670
I do. We tried rowing, waterskiing,

31:18.670 --> 31:20.840
and climbing all based on YouTube videos,

31:20.840 --> 31:22.540
and it turned out you could do all those things.

31:22.540 --> 31:24.280
Right. But...

31:24.420 --> 31:25.260
But...?

31:25.260 --> 31:26.580
The fans wrote to us and said,

31:26.580 --> 31:28.930
with all that time and practice with those beautiful,

31:28.930 --> 31:31.360
big excavators, why couldn't we have come up

31:31.370 --> 31:34.140
with our own crazy thing to do with them?

31:34.140 --> 31:35.350
Okay. I like that.

31:35.350 --> 31:37.630
Well, what if you did something counterintuitive,

31:37.630 --> 31:39.840
like little things with big machines?

31:39.840 --> 31:42.240
You mean like comically delicate operations

31:42.240 --> 31:44.350
with huge pieces of industrial equipment?

31:44.350 --> 31:45.320
Exactly.

31:45.320 --> 31:46.100
I love that.

31:46.100 --> 31:47.350
Let's totally do it.

31:48.250 --> 31:49.300
Last time around,

31:49.300 --> 31:53.680
Adam and Jamie's excavator viral videos were three for three.

31:53.680 --> 31:56.700
This has got to be one of the strangest things that I've ever done.

31:56.700 --> 31:57.750
As each stunt,

31:57.750 --> 32:00.030
based on pure mechanical power,

32:00.030 --> 32:00.990
was confirmed.

32:00.990 --> 32:02.930
Holy crap! It's working!

32:03.480 --> 32:06.400
But now, in a viewer-request fest...

32:06.400 --> 32:07.680
This is perfect!

32:07.970 --> 32:10.600
the "Mythbusters" are taking a different tact.

32:10.830 --> 32:12.020
Oh, yeah.

32:12.020 --> 32:15.520
The seemingly impossible challenges they've set themselves...

32:15.520 --> 32:17.030
And now for the thread.

32:17.030 --> 32:21.290
involve not brute force but delicacy and precisions.

32:21.290 --> 32:22.740
See whether that'll do it.

32:23.540 --> 32:25.540
Jamie's in the hot seat first.

32:26.580 --> 32:28.140
Granny here's got a problem.

32:28.170 --> 32:30.530
She's a little bit old, a little bit beyond her years,

32:30.530 --> 32:31.540
and she can't see very well.

32:31.540 --> 32:34.710
She's got socks to darn, but she can't thread her needle.

32:34.710 --> 32:37.600
So dutiful grandson Jamie's gonna help her in the only way

32:37.600 --> 32:42.220
he knows how -- with large pieces of heavy, industrial machinery.

32:42.260 --> 32:44.700
Now this poses certain challenges.

32:44.890 --> 32:47.170
First off, the thing is so heavy that

32:47.180 --> 32:48.620
once you get it going,

32:48.620 --> 32:50.170
it's kind of hard to stop it,

32:50.170 --> 32:52.880
at least if you're talking, like, tiny,

32:52.880 --> 32:54.630
tiny fractions of an inch.

32:54.630 --> 32:55.500
Stop.

32:56.860 --> 32:57.800
Come in.

32:58.290 --> 33:00.680
And the second thing is that the controls themselves -- well,

33:00.690 --> 33:02.490
they're just not that fine.

33:03.660 --> 33:05.240
You're nudging the bucket.

33:06.020 --> 33:07.850
So, whether it'll actually make those

33:07.850 --> 33:09.670
little delicate movements we need or not

33:09.670 --> 33:11.790
is anybody's guess at this point.

33:11.980 --> 33:15.030
But after a few minutes of constant communication...

33:15.290 --> 33:16.170
More?

33:16.170 --> 33:17.470
Yeah, a little bit more.

33:17.630 --> 33:20.150
and patented "Mythbuster" perseverance...

33:22.000 --> 33:23.470
"anybody's guess"...

33:23.680 --> 33:25.660
Oh! So close.

33:25.670 --> 33:27.590
turns into "mission accomplished"!

33:27.590 --> 33:28.880
Oh! Stop!

33:29.880 --> 33:31.020
We might have gotten it!

33:32.010 --> 33:33.740
Yes! It's in!

33:33.840 --> 33:34.900
Yeah!

33:35.460 --> 33:36.730
Pull it through!

33:38.750 --> 33:40.260
Don't believe it? Check this out.

33:42.670 --> 33:46.220
That is one threaded needle with an excavator.

33:47.350 --> 33:48.890
Nice work, granny.

33:48.890 --> 33:51.500
Now you can get back to work on my socks.

33:55.220 --> 33:56.630
That was James Hyneman.

33:57.120 --> 33:58.990
Using a diesel-powered,

33:58.990 --> 34:02.030
38,000-pound hydraulic excavator,

34:02.300 --> 34:05.850
Jamie threaded a needle with surgical precision.

34:08.020 --> 34:08.600
Question is,

34:08.600 --> 34:12.080
can Adam pull off something more impressive?

34:12.480 --> 34:14.199
Let me walk you through how this is gonna go.

34:14.199 --> 34:15.840
I'm gonna try and pour a glass of wine

34:15.840 --> 34:19.330
from this bottle into this glass using that excavator.

34:20.250 --> 34:21.940
I've got an attachment on the bucket of my excavator

34:21.940 --> 34:23.080
that hopefully will allow me,

34:23.080 --> 34:25.150
with Jamie's help and guidance,

34:25.150 --> 34:27.469
to pick up this bottle of wine and tilt it.

34:27.469 --> 34:29.380
When it is properly aimed over the glass,

34:29.380 --> 34:31.350
I am going to pull out a paintball gun

34:31.360 --> 34:33.560
and shoot this cap off the bottle of wine,

34:33.730 --> 34:36.080
hopefully releasing the wine into the glass.

34:36.080 --> 34:36.989
And if all goes well,

34:36.989 --> 34:39.260
we'll have a sip to celebrate.

34:39.739 --> 34:42.080
Once again, the mythbusters

34:42.080 --> 34:43.639
do their delicate digger dance.

34:44.210 --> 34:46.070
Am I lined up nice and level?

34:46.130 --> 34:47.870
Back just a hair.

34:47.870 --> 34:51.639
This time, easing Adam's wire arm over the bottle...

34:51.790 --> 34:52.840
Looking good!

34:53.449 --> 34:54.830
Yeah, you're clear.

34:57.139 --> 34:58.230
Awesome!

34:58.320 --> 35:00.420
Here we go -- lifting the bottle of wine!

35:00.420 --> 35:03.410
Showing all the control of an excavator expert,

35:03.410 --> 35:07.080
Adam swiftly gets into position to prepare to pour...

35:07.790 --> 35:08.820
All right!

35:08.820 --> 35:10.270
Let's uncork this puppy.

35:10.270 --> 35:13.070
With -- what else? -- a paintball gun.

35:13.070 --> 35:14.060
Safety is off!

35:14.060 --> 35:15.040
Here we go.

35:15.040 --> 35:16.180
Uncorking.

35:19.660 --> 35:20.670
You got it!

35:21.010 --> 35:22.530
That is pouring, baby!

35:23.340 --> 35:24.610
It's perfect.

35:28.420 --> 35:31.360
Tastes like paintball and victory.

35:31.570 --> 35:34.370
While this method of pouring your wine might not be for everyone,

35:34.370 --> 35:36.230
I think that we definitively proved

35:36.230 --> 35:37.510
that if it's just you,

35:37.510 --> 35:39.920
your loved one, and some heavy machinery,

35:39.920 --> 35:41.570
it's totally viable now.

35:42.220 --> 35:43.310
Our videos are in the can.

35:43.310 --> 35:44.870
Do you think they're gonna go viral?

35:44.970 --> 35:46.320
Only one way to find out,

35:46.320 --> 35:48.630
and that's to upload them to the net and wait.

35:48.630 --> 35:49.560
Well, let's do it.

35:49.560 --> 35:50.460
Okay.

35:54.690 --> 35:55.730
Coming right up,

35:55.730 --> 35:58.710
Bird balance reaches its cliffhanger finale...

35:58.710 --> 36:01.090
Oh! It's coming off the ground!

36:01.270 --> 36:04.590
and will Adam and Jamie's loose cannon fire?

36:04.590 --> 36:06.470
310; 320.

36:06.730 --> 36:07.640
Go!

36:15.930 --> 36:18.610
Precariously perched 300 feet up,

36:18.610 --> 36:21.040
the "Mythbusters" limo is fixed for

36:21.040 --> 36:22.440
its cliffhanger finale.

36:22.850 --> 36:24.910
Let's let him stabilize for a second.

36:26.010 --> 36:29.580
But will the 40-pound bustard tip it over the edge?

36:30.000 --> 36:31.280
Okay, here we go...

36:31.280 --> 36:34.440
In 3, 2, 1.

36:38.150 --> 36:39.240
Despite the wind,

36:39.240 --> 36:41.110
it's a bull's-eye with the bird.

36:41.120 --> 36:43.600
But there's no shift to the slant.

36:43.690 --> 36:44.740
I thought it was gonna go.

36:44.740 --> 36:46.280
We had the advantage of the lever,

36:46.280 --> 36:48.700
the super-heavy bird, and the wind going nuts.

36:48.700 --> 36:50.100
I can't believe it didn't tip.

36:50.100 --> 36:51.720
All right, let's get some more birds.

36:51.720 --> 36:53.280
All right, I got just the thing.

36:54.090 --> 36:57.110
Yep, it's time for Grant's reinforcements.

36:57.320 --> 36:59.740
This is the turkey chandelier.

36:59.750 --> 37:03.720
It holds 40 turkeys, each one weighing about 25 pounds.

37:03.720 --> 37:06.600
We've got a rope with an individual quick-release

37:06.600 --> 37:09.130
to each one so we can drop them one by one

37:09.130 --> 37:11.150
and see how many turkeys it takes

37:11.150 --> 37:13.400
to send the limo over the cliff.

37:14.350 --> 37:16.110
You guys ready for the turkey chandelier?

37:16.110 --> 37:17.950
All right, turkeys away!

37:19.810 --> 37:22.840
One by one, the out-of-date turkeys tumble

37:22.840 --> 37:25.390
into position on the very front of the hood...

37:25.390 --> 37:27.240
Smashed the windshield.

37:27.400 --> 37:29.100
and just like last time,

37:29.100 --> 37:31.370
the number of birds the car can hold

37:31.430 --> 37:33.760
is taking everyone by surprise.

37:34.810 --> 37:37.400
It's amazing how much weight the car can take.

37:38.520 --> 37:39.630
In actual fact,

37:39.630 --> 37:43.340
it's not until there's 500 pounds of poultry

37:43.340 --> 37:45.430
that the limo starts to lean.

37:46.420 --> 37:47.670
Look at the back end!

37:48.440 --> 37:50.080
It's coming off the ground!

37:50.430 --> 37:51.650
24!

37:52.150 --> 37:53.690
I think it's about to go!

37:53.690 --> 37:54.680
25!

37:54.680 --> 37:55.480
All right, one more.

37:55.480 --> 37:57.420
- Drop one more.  -26!

37:57.420 --> 37:59.720
At last, we have liftoff.

38:11.780 --> 38:13.470
26 birds!

38:13.780 --> 38:15.230
That was awesome!

38:15.230 --> 38:16.830
Awesome for sure.

38:17.170 --> 38:20.680
But one kori bustard and 26 turkeys,

38:20.680 --> 38:23.160
or 700 pounds in weight,

38:23.220 --> 38:27.720
means that this myth is busted not once but twice.

38:28.800 --> 38:30.030
Any way you look at this,

38:30.030 --> 38:31.290
it's not gonna happen.

38:31.300 --> 38:34.570
For one, it's very difficult to get perfectly balanced

38:34.570 --> 38:35.760
on the edge of a cliff.

38:35.760 --> 38:37.920
And even if you are perfectly balanced,

38:37.920 --> 38:40.110
it's not gonna take one bird to send you over,

38:40.110 --> 38:41.630
two birds or three birds or five birds.

38:41.630 --> 38:43.810
It's gonna take many, many birds.

38:43.810 --> 38:45.860
And even with a really long limo,

38:45.860 --> 38:49.760
it took 26 turkeys to send us over the cliff.

38:49.760 --> 38:51.470
This one is busted.

38:54.260 --> 38:55.120
Let's get out of here.

38:55.940 --> 38:57.650
Importantly, how are we getting home?

38:57.650 --> 38:59.900
- That was our ride. - Jive turkey!

38:59.900 --> 39:01.610
Turkey! Jive turkey!

39:06.700 --> 39:08.590
With wildfires...

39:10.080 --> 39:11.580
and pressure leaks...

39:11.580 --> 39:13.170
So cantankerous.

39:13.550 --> 39:16.440
the water heater's first mission was a failure.

39:16.730 --> 39:17.870
It's a rainbow.

39:18.210 --> 39:20.320
But having replaced the culprit --

39:20.320 --> 39:21.950
a misfiring heating element...

39:21.950 --> 39:22.530
We are good.

39:22.530 --> 39:23.370
Everything's hooked up.

39:23.370 --> 39:26.430
the "Mythbusters" are nearly set for take two.

39:27.030 --> 39:29.250
Gonna see Jamie and me zapped back in time.

39:29.260 --> 39:32.270
It'll be like, "We can provide you with the ultimate weapon

39:32.390 --> 39:34.210
as long as you've got a day to set it up

39:34.210 --> 39:36.580
and your enemy doesn't move for six hours at a time

39:36.580 --> 39:38.220
and you don't mind a one-day reload,

39:38.290 --> 39:40.160
we will smite them!"

39:40.220 --> 39:42.890
Luckily, it's not the efficiency they're testing.

39:42.890 --> 39:44.710
It's the cannon's power.

39:44.760 --> 39:47.330
Well, everything's bolted in place, and the thing is heating up.

39:47.330 --> 39:48.780
Shall we get to safety?

39:48.940 --> 39:49.990
I think it's time.

39:51.260 --> 39:53.170
Well, this is the second time we're attempting

39:53.170 --> 39:54.260
to set off the hot-water heater

39:54.260 --> 39:56.400
inside our closed-canister cannon.

39:56.580 --> 39:57.910
And hopefully, the results will

39:57.910 --> 39:59.900
be far more spectacular than the first time.

40:01.300 --> 40:02.460
I hope this works.

40:03.300 --> 40:06.240
Remember that should this cannon go off...

40:06.480 --> 40:07.560
200.

40:07.600 --> 40:10.680
they'll compare the subsequent brick destruction...

40:11.900 --> 40:14.600
to their earlier civil war cannon tests...

40:14.730 --> 40:15.850
There she is.

40:16.780 --> 40:19.190
and to ensure an accurate comparison,

40:19.230 --> 40:21.450
the distance between the barrel and bricks

40:21.620 --> 40:23.980
is identical -- 26 feet.

40:24.210 --> 40:26.080
Things are starting to happen really quickly now.

40:26.080 --> 40:29.360
We're increasing about a PSI every 6 seconds.

40:29.370 --> 40:30.430
That's fast.

40:30.860 --> 40:34.020
This time, with no spontaneous combustion...

40:34.030 --> 40:34.980
280.

40:35.010 --> 40:37.050
or strange pressure plummets...

40:37.050 --> 40:38.070
290.

40:38.070 --> 40:40.740
things are finally cooking with gas.

40:42.530 --> 40:43.600
300 PSI?

40:43.600 --> 40:44.500
Yep.

40:46.320 --> 40:47.340
320.

40:48.050 --> 40:48.950
Go!

40:58.280 --> 41:00.690
Wow, that was like a dun! Foom!

41:00.800 --> 41:02.450
And then it was a fire holes.

41:03.050 --> 41:05.870
It sure was both wet and wild,

41:05.870 --> 41:08.300
as their cannon finally went crazy.

41:08.310 --> 41:11.310
But how does the all-important damage shape up?

41:13.330 --> 41:16.720
It doesn't look like it made it past the first pallet.

41:17.100 --> 41:18.930
I think that's the ball right there.

41:18.930 --> 41:19.780
Where's that?

41:19.780 --> 41:20.760
Where is it?

41:20.970 --> 41:22.080
Oh, there it is.

41:24.640 --> 41:27.520
That was really, really lovely.

41:27.770 --> 41:29.760
I'm a little sad that it didn't go farther,

41:29.760 --> 41:32.460
but it still went respectably deep.

41:32.480 --> 41:34.670
Respectably deep is right.

41:34.670 --> 41:38.300
Because while it may be true that the steam cannon had less

41:38.300 --> 41:41.150
destructive power than its gunpowder counterpart,

41:41.160 --> 41:43.580
the damage is dramatic.

41:44.140 --> 41:46.280
That means it's an effective cannon.

41:46.400 --> 41:47.940
It's not practical.

41:47.940 --> 41:50.290
It's not easy to move around a 40-foot cannon

41:50.290 --> 41:52.530
and wait hours for it to go off,

41:52.530 --> 41:54.250
but it's pretty dangerous.

41:54.250 --> 41:55.540
It's a serious cannon.

41:56.350 --> 41:58.280
Well, that was a cannonball,

41:58.280 --> 41:59.490
that was a cannon.

41:59.690 --> 42:01.860
It did its destructive thing,

42:01.870 --> 42:03.490
and I think we proved our point.

42:03.600 --> 42:05.850
I think mission is fully accomplished.

42:06.160 --> 42:07.660
All right. Well, let's get out of here.

42:08.030 --> 42:09.570
Figure out something else to do with hot-water heaters.

42:09.570 --> 42:10.720
I love those things.

42:11.305 --> 42:17.476
