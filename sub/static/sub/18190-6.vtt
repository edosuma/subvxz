WEBVTT

00:03.940 --> 00:07.580
If anyone is to end her
life, it will be me.

00:10.020 --> 00:13.170
~ What's she doing here?! ~ She's
with me. ~ I mean you no harm.

00:13.220 --> 00:15.250
She will kill us the
first chance she gets.

00:15.300 --> 00:16.290
I don't believe that.

00:16.340 --> 00:19.890
~ If we are to escape with our lives,
you have to trust me. ~ Never.

00:19.940 --> 00:22.500
Let her go! No!

01:30.140 --> 01:31.650
Medea!

01:31.700 --> 01:33.100
I know you can hear me.

01:35.820 --> 01:41.250
I swear, I will find you,
and I will kill you.

01:47.140 --> 01:48.490
Where is she?

01:48.540 --> 01:51.900
~ She's here somewhere.
We have to find her. ~ Jason.

01:53.060 --> 01:54.380
The Queen needs you.

01:58.500 --> 01:59.490
What have I done?

01:59.540 --> 02:01.020
We must get her back to Atlantis.

02:19.140 --> 02:20.260
Jason.

02:49.660 --> 02:51.060
You must wait here.

03:14.380 --> 03:16.010
I understand you are a healer?

03:16.060 --> 03:18.890
A practitioner of
medicine, of sorts.

03:18.940 --> 03:22.740
I will need betony
and blue iris root.

03:33.820 --> 03:36.540
She's in good hands. The best hands.

03:38.260 --> 03:43.300
If she dies, I will
never forgive myself.

03:45.220 --> 03:51.570
Tende thean kaleus hemon empsukhon
hapanton akraiphnus iakhoros

03:51.620 --> 03:53.730
iatrikon ergon hagizo.

03:53.780 --> 03:58.420
Hapanton akraiphnus iakhoros
iatrikon ergon hagizo.

04:02.460 --> 04:05.530
You weren't to know
what Medea would do.

04:05.580 --> 04:07.010
You knew.

04:07.060 --> 04:09.330
You see the best in people.

04:09.380 --> 04:11.930
It's your faith that
makes you who you are.

04:11.980 --> 04:16.380
And what if my faith in people
costs Ariadne her life?

04:19.700 --> 04:25.170
Potna thea tethus he phos te bion
te porizei tende g'idu noseran

04:25.220 --> 04:27.340
ten hemeteren basilissan.

05:01.980 --> 05:04.170
Are you hungry?

05:04.220 --> 05:06.490
You must be hungry.
You should eat something.

05:06.540 --> 05:07.580
I have no appetite.

05:12.020 --> 05:14.020
~ How is she?
~ She's resting.

05:15.500 --> 05:17.690
Is she going to be
all right? Tell me.

05:17.740 --> 05:19.500
I have done what I can for her.

05:20.820 --> 05:22.700
It is in the hands of the Gods now.

05:28.180 --> 05:29.490
I have to know.

05:29.540 --> 05:32.780
~ The Queen was badly wounded.
Nothing is certain. ~ Please.

05:34.220 --> 05:38.010
She is very weak, but
the bleeding has stopped.

05:38.060 --> 05:39.570
Praise the Gods.

05:39.620 --> 05:41.170
You should be at her side.

05:41.220 --> 05:42.260
Thank you.

05:48.060 --> 05:49.850
How is he?

05:49.900 --> 05:51.340
He blames himself.

05:52.900 --> 05:54.730
Are you hungry? You must be hungry.

05:54.780 --> 05:56.370
You should eat something.

05:56.420 --> 05:57.490
I have no appetite.

05:57.540 --> 05:59.660
Well, I for one have
to eat something.

06:17.540 --> 06:18.700
Jason?

06:24.060 --> 06:25.260
I won't leave your side.

06:35.620 --> 06:40.450
It's very kind of you to
let me stay in your home.

06:40.500 --> 06:43.140
Not at all. It's the least I can do.

06:45.780 --> 06:51.210
I am well known for my
kindness and generosity.

06:51.260 --> 06:55.290
Everyone will tell you.
Almost everyone will tell you.

06:55.340 --> 06:59.130
Tomorrow, I shall be on my way.

06:59.180 --> 07:01.770
Really? You're welcome to
stay as long as you need.

07:01.820 --> 07:05.300
I must attend to Eurydice's
funeral rites.

07:12.940 --> 07:17.420
You are welcome to finish
the rest of it.

07:22.500 --> 07:24.300
I'm so sorry about Eurydice.

07:27.260 --> 07:30.090
I know how it feels to
lose your true love.

07:30.140 --> 07:33.690
Eurydice isn't lost to me.

07:33.740 --> 07:35.290
But she's dead?

07:35.340 --> 07:42.490
Well, do you think that I could
let that stand between us?

07:42.540 --> 07:44.330
Oh, no, no.

07:44.380 --> 07:50.420
We shall be together again, even
if I must journey to Hades.

07:51.900 --> 07:57.570
Love only dies when
you give up on it.

07:57.620 --> 08:02.580
As long as I have breath in my body,
then I know there is still hope.

08:05.380 --> 08:10.970
I'm old and tired,
and in need of my bed.

08:11.020 --> 08:13.010
Good night.

08:13.060 --> 08:17.500
Where there is love,
there is always a way.

08:22.220 --> 08:23.660
Good night, Hercules.

08:51.180 --> 08:52.220
Ariadne?

08:57.460 --> 09:00.620
Help! Please! Please!
Someone help me!

09:01.980 --> 09:05.130
I can't understand it. The
wound had stopped bleeding.

09:05.180 --> 09:07.730
It's as if there is something
preventing the Queen's

09:07.780 --> 09:09.290
body from healing itself.

09:09.340 --> 09:13.650
~ You believe she has an
infection? ~ An infection? No.

09:13.700 --> 09:17.010
What do you mean?
Will the wound heal?

09:17.060 --> 09:20.650
I can't be certain.

09:20.700 --> 09:21.940
Do you have the knife?

09:26.300 --> 09:31.530
O themi dos sophian hemin.
Pothen esti tod' enkhose

09:31.580 --> 09:38.930
Manti thea, nun deixon
emoi kai pleiona erga.

09:38.980 --> 09:45.140
Nun dunamin dos emoi mekhri
peusomai hatta genoito.

09:49.700 --> 09:56.380
The sorceress who has enchanted
this blade has great power.

09:58.860 --> 10:05.570
This dagger is imbued with a death
curse. But it is Colchean magic.

10:05.620 --> 10:06.730
I cannot undo it.

10:06.780 --> 10:09.490
No. There must be
something you can do?

10:09.540 --> 10:15.730
It is beyond my powers. I fear
the Queen's wound is fatal.

10:15.780 --> 10:18.650
No! No! I won't let her die.

10:18.700 --> 10:19.980
There must be something!

10:23.380 --> 10:24.540
What?

10:25.540 --> 10:27.330
What is it?

10:27.380 --> 10:28.540
Tell me.

10:30.660 --> 10:34.420
~ There are some who may have
the knowledge you seek. ~ Who?

10:35.620 --> 10:37.820
They are known as the Grey Sisters.

10:38.860 --> 10:42.170
They are the most powerful
seers on this earth.

10:42.220 --> 10:47.210
Nothing escapes their gaze, not
even the minds of the Gods.

10:47.260 --> 10:50.370
If there is a cure for
Ariadne, they will know it.

10:50.420 --> 10:52.250
Where can I find them?

10:52.300 --> 10:54.690
They are dangerous.

10:54.740 --> 10:59.970
They may tell you things
you do not wish to hear.

11:00.020 --> 11:03.570
If they can heal Ariadne, then
that is a risk I must take.

11:03.620 --> 11:05.420
Now tell me, where I can find them?

11:26.660 --> 11:31.730
Look at him. He'll stop at
nothing to heal Ariadne.

11:31.780 --> 11:36.010
He'll never give up,
no matter what it takes.

11:36.060 --> 11:38.260
~ What's wrong? ~ Nothing.

11:39.620 --> 11:41.010
When your face is all screwed up

11:41.060 --> 11:42.850
and jowly like that, it
is never nothing.

11:42.900 --> 11:44.570
Jowly? I was thinking.

11:44.620 --> 11:46.290
Which is when you
are at your jowliest.

11:46.340 --> 11:49.010
I'm nothing but a joke to you, am I?

11:49.060 --> 11:52.780
Stupid, jowly Hercules who
cares for no-one but himself!

11:54.220 --> 11:55.700
Hercules, what's wrong?

11:57.180 --> 11:59.290
Medusa.

11:59.340 --> 12:01.810
I promised I'd find her a cure
and what have I done? Nothing.

12:01.860 --> 12:03.770
I've left her rotting in that cave.

12:03.820 --> 12:05.130
There was nothing you could do.

12:05.180 --> 12:08.690
Or is that what I tell myself
because it's easier?

12:08.740 --> 12:12.370
Orpheus and Jason, they'd never
give up on the women they love.

12:12.420 --> 12:15.020
They'd go the ends of
the Earth and beyond.

12:20.700 --> 12:24.570
Rumours of the Queen's plight
have spread throughout Atlantis.

12:24.620 --> 12:26.610
The people are fearful.

12:26.660 --> 12:27.650
When the Queen dies,

12:27.700 --> 12:30.490
there are many in the city who will
support your claim to the throne.

12:30.540 --> 12:33.530
Good. I want to know
the moment she passes.

12:33.580 --> 12:35.410
It will be done, Your Highness.

12:35.460 --> 12:37.690
I am not yet Queen.

12:37.740 --> 12:41.180
But soon. I look forward to
serving in your court.

12:43.420 --> 12:45.570
Tell me, Cilix.

12:45.620 --> 12:49.050
When you are in my court, will
you betray me so easily?

12:49.100 --> 12:50.890
I have always been loyal.

12:50.940 --> 12:53.370
Minos could not have taken
the throne without my support.

12:53.420 --> 12:57.130
For which you were well rewarded.
Your loyalty was bought.

12:57.180 --> 13:00.340
Who's to say it could not
be bought by someone else?

13:01.980 --> 13:06.140
Coming here like this,
I am risking everything!

13:07.900 --> 13:11.410
If you fail, I will more than
likely be executed as a traitor.

13:11.460 --> 13:15.530
Then it is in both our
interests that I succeed.

13:15.580 --> 13:16.620
Indeed.

13:37.700 --> 13:38.970
Listen.

13:43.620 --> 13:45.210
I don't hear anything.

13:45.260 --> 13:46.420
There's no bird song.

14:17.780 --> 14:19.210
Is it just me,

14:19.260 --> 14:22.820
or does anyone else have a really
bad feeling about this place?

14:25.180 --> 14:26.930
What are these things?

14:26.980 --> 14:28.020
They're totems.

14:38.540 --> 14:39.570
He's here.

14:39.620 --> 14:41.450
What does he look like?

14:41.500 --> 14:44.090
He's handsome. A pretty boy.

14:44.140 --> 14:46.220
I want to see him. Give me the eye.

14:49.100 --> 14:50.730
Oh!

14:50.780 --> 14:52.450
A very pretty boy.

14:52.500 --> 14:53.770
You know who I am?

14:53.820 --> 14:55.850
We have been expecting you.

14:55.900 --> 14:57.820
Long have we waited.

14:58.860 --> 15:00.570
Then you know why I'm here?

15:00.620 --> 15:02.010
You wish to heal the Queen.

15:02.060 --> 15:03.930
His precious Queen.

15:03.980 --> 15:06.410
You must love her very much.

15:06.460 --> 15:07.770
Do you know how to heal her?

15:07.820 --> 15:11.130
~ We know many things.
~ See many things.

15:11.180 --> 15:12.220
Tell me.

15:15.260 --> 15:17.330
~ Please. ~ You have something for us?

15:17.380 --> 15:19.770
Oh, has he brought us a gift?

15:19.820 --> 15:22.250
~ I have nothing. ~ Nothing?

15:22.300 --> 15:23.850
Then you will receive nothing.

15:23.900 --> 15:27.130
No. You have to help
me. Ariadne is dying.

15:27.180 --> 15:28.490
I'm begging you.

15:28.540 --> 15:31.530
~ He's begging!
~ Such a pretty boy.

15:31.580 --> 15:33.330
Tell me what you want
from me. Anything.

15:33.380 --> 15:36.970
I want to see him. Give me the eye.

15:37.020 --> 15:38.530
Who has the eye? Where is the eye?

15:38.580 --> 15:43.210
~ You can't see? ~ The boy has it!
~ Give it back!

15:43.260 --> 15:44.370
Give her the eye!

15:44.420 --> 15:46.970
Answer my question.
How do I heal Ariadne?

15:47.020 --> 15:48.690
The eye first.

15:48.740 --> 15:50.450
I swear, I will slice it in two.

15:50.500 --> 15:52.220
~ No! ~ Tell me what I want to know!

15:55.700 --> 15:59.290
There is but one way
to heal the Queen.

15:59.340 --> 16:03.740
The wound must be treated with
the blood of the enchantress.

16:05.100 --> 16:06.530
Medea?

16:06.580 --> 16:08.690
Blood to heal blood.

16:08.740 --> 16:09.850
Where do I find her?

16:09.900 --> 16:12.850
Oh, the witch is with her Goddess.

16:12.900 --> 16:14.770
The Temple of Hecate.

16:14.820 --> 16:18.090
Deep within the Kalabrian forest.

16:18.140 --> 16:20.810
There is nothing I would like
more than to spill her blood.

16:23.460 --> 16:26.090
Such a stupid boy!

16:26.140 --> 16:28.090
Stupid and pretty.

16:28.140 --> 16:30.970
~ You must not kill her. ~ Why?

16:31.020 --> 16:36.610
~ He's blinder than us.
~ Ha-ha. Stupid and blind.

16:36.660 --> 16:40.730
Your fates are entwined.

16:40.780 --> 16:44.170
~ No. You're lying.
~ No, it is you who lies.

16:44.220 --> 16:47.010
Lies to yourself.

16:47.060 --> 16:49.930
You already sense it.

16:49.980 --> 16:54.450
Without her, all that you
strive for will be lost.

16:54.500 --> 16:59.380
You will come to see that,
one day in a far off land.

17:01.940 --> 17:08.369
~ You have your answer.
Give us the eye! ~ The eye!

17:08.420 --> 17:09.410
Catch!

17:11.460 --> 17:15.099
~ Where is it?!
~ Where's the eye?

17:29.380 --> 17:31.730
The Kalabrian Forest.

17:31.780 --> 17:36.340
They say it is cursed, a place
of sorcery of the darkest kind.

17:39.060 --> 17:43.380
Why is it never a sun kissed
meadow, or a pretty olive grove?

18:01.100 --> 18:04.940
It's scared. It senses
what lies in the forest.

18:06.540 --> 18:08.020
We will have to continue on foot.

18:25.820 --> 18:28.170
He's very quiet.

18:28.220 --> 18:31.930
~ I imagine he's thinking about what
the grey sisters told him. ~ And?

18:31.980 --> 18:35.330
Why did they say that Jason and
Medea's fates were entwined?

18:35.380 --> 18:38.090
He's going to kill her. You
don't get more entwined.

18:38.140 --> 18:40.810
~ They said he wouldn't be able
to kill her. ~ What do they know?

18:40.860 --> 18:43.130
They're the most powerful
seers known to man.

18:43.180 --> 18:46.330
Fair point. Well, if Jason can't
kill her, we'll just have to.

18:46.380 --> 18:48.650
Then according to the Grey
Sisters, everything Jason

18:48.700 --> 18:50.370
strives for will be lost.

18:50.420 --> 18:52.690
So you're saying we can't
kill her either?

18:52.740 --> 18:54.130
I don't know.

18:54.180 --> 18:56.850
There are forces at work we can't
possibly begin to understand.

18:56.900 --> 18:59.090
I miss the days when you
could kill a witch

18:59.140 --> 19:01.340
and not worry about the consequences.

19:18.780 --> 19:19.820
What was that?

19:22.100 --> 19:24.090
I believe it was a Stymphalian Bird.

19:24.140 --> 19:26.330
They are ugly beasts.

19:26.380 --> 19:28.570
With an insatiable thirst for blood.

19:28.620 --> 19:31.650
It is said they can detect the scent

19:31.700 --> 19:34.850
of a single drop
at a thousand paces.

19:34.900 --> 19:36.770
Although I doubt anyone
has scientifically

19:36.820 --> 19:38.820
measured the distance.

19:52.300 --> 19:55.730
They're sure to have guards posted.

19:55.780 --> 19:57.180
We will wait until nightfall.

20:09.380 --> 20:10.420
What's wrong?

20:13.660 --> 20:15.740
I was just thinking about Ariadne.

20:21.220 --> 20:23.170
~ What is it? ~ Listen.

20:26.180 --> 20:27.780
~ What? ~ There.

20:31.220 --> 20:32.380
Mosquito!

20:34.060 --> 20:38.140
A mosquito? I won't be
needing my sword then.

20:42.780 --> 20:44.410
Gotcha!

20:44.460 --> 20:46.980
One more beast dispatched to Hades.

20:49.260 --> 20:50.580
Hercules.

20:53.740 --> 20:56.330
Don't worry. I'm pretty
sure I'll survive.

20:59.860 --> 21:03.940
~ The Stymphalian Birds. They have
scented your blood. ~ Run! Run!

22:10.780 --> 22:12.660
Stupid bird.

22:14.620 --> 22:17.330
You can't leave the gully until
you've stopped bleeding.

22:17.380 --> 22:18.730
They'll tear you to shreds.

22:18.780 --> 22:20.970
All that will be left of
you is your bones.

22:21.020 --> 22:23.970
Thank you for those
words of comfort.

22:24.020 --> 22:26.140
~ I'm going on alone.
~ No!

22:27.540 --> 22:31.290
There's no time. Ariadne will
die unless her wound is treated.

22:31.340 --> 22:32.370
Go with him.

22:32.420 --> 22:33.930
No. We can't leave you here.

22:33.980 --> 22:36.610
~ Patch me up as best you can.
~ No, you have to stay.

22:36.660 --> 22:39.170
You're not going in there alone.
It's too dangerous. Go.

22:39.220 --> 22:41.930
~ Stay with him. ~ Just
leave me and go! ~ Stay.

22:41.980 --> 22:47.170
Stop it, both of you, or I will bang
your stupid, empty heads together!

22:47.220 --> 22:48.930
We have no choice.

22:48.980 --> 22:52.980
If I don't stop the bleeding, you
won't make it out this forest alive.

22:57.060 --> 22:58.810
Then that's settled then.

22:58.860 --> 23:02.010
Just try not to do anything heroic.

23:02.060 --> 23:03.700
And by heroic, I mean stupid.

23:05.100 --> 23:07.130
I'll try my best.

23:07.180 --> 23:08.500
Jason.

23:11.660 --> 23:13.620
~ What's that?
~ It's for Medea's blood.

23:21.580 --> 23:23.300
This is madness.

25:40.580 --> 25:42.420
Alert the queen!

25:54.300 --> 25:55.580
You have come to kill me?

25:59.180 --> 26:01.690
You deserve to die for
what you did to Ariadne.

26:01.740 --> 26:03.050
For me to kill her is wrong,

26:03.100 --> 26:05.090
but for you to take my
life is somehow right?

26:05.140 --> 26:07.500
~ It's necessary.
~ Then why do you hesitate?

26:08.980 --> 26:10.970
Maybe I'm not as cold
blooded as you.

26:11.020 --> 26:13.410
But you will kill me nonetheless?

26:13.460 --> 26:15.580
What is it that's stopping you?

26:19.300 --> 26:22.050
You feel it as I do.

26:22.100 --> 26:23.900
We are both touched by the Gods.

26:26.540 --> 26:28.450
You don't know me.

26:28.500 --> 26:31.100
I sense something in you,
as you sense it in me.

26:35.380 --> 26:36.580
You can't deny it.

27:14.380 --> 27:15.740
Seize him!

27:19.980 --> 27:21.340
Take him to the cells.

27:24.540 --> 27:26.500
Medea? Medea?!

27:39.780 --> 27:41.290
How do you feel?

27:41.340 --> 27:42.850
I'm fine.

27:42.900 --> 27:46.250
Did he say anything to you?

27:46.300 --> 27:47.810
Medea?

27:47.860 --> 27:50.090
Only that he meant to kill me
for what I did to Ariadne.

27:50.140 --> 27:52.650
And yet he spared your
life. Why is that?

27:52.700 --> 27:53.740
I do not know.

27:58.340 --> 28:01.100
What will you do to him?
Are you going to kill him?

28:02.380 --> 28:05.340
~ It isn't that simple. ~ Why?

28:07.980 --> 28:09.300
Because he is my son.

28:16.500 --> 28:18.690
I shouldn't have let him go.

28:18.740 --> 28:21.650
You think you could have stopped him?

28:21.700 --> 28:25.250
He could have been
caught. Or killed.

28:25.300 --> 28:28.930
He could have run into
Pasiphae and killed her.

28:28.980 --> 28:30.490
Or he could have run into Pasiphae

28:30.540 --> 28:32.530
and discovered that
she's his mother.

28:32.580 --> 28:34.940
That does not bear thinking about.

28:37.500 --> 28:40.780
Until your wounds are healed, there
is nothing we can do but wait.

28:55.420 --> 28:59.650
I'm sorry, I startled
you. Forgive the chains.

28:59.700 --> 29:02.770
~ Take them off, if you like.
~ And what would you do if I did?

29:02.820 --> 29:06.170
~ You'd kill me, wouldn't you?
~ I'd certainly try.

29:06.220 --> 29:10.450
That's understandable. After all,
you think of me as your enemy.

29:10.500 --> 29:11.850
That is who you are.

29:11.900 --> 29:14.100
Perhaps it doesn't
have to be that way.

29:16.940 --> 29:18.900
You expect me to change sides?

29:21.500 --> 29:24.490
You talk of sides.

29:24.540 --> 29:26.090
It is never that simple.

29:26.140 --> 29:28.100
It is that simple to me.

29:29.940 --> 29:33.250
So if you're going to kill me,
you may as well get on with it.

29:33.300 --> 29:36.330
Are you really that anxious to die?

29:36.380 --> 29:37.860
What do you want?

29:40.260 --> 29:41.540
Please, eat.

29:48.420 --> 29:51.020
If I wanted to kill you,
you'd already be dead.

29:58.380 --> 30:01.970
So why did you spare my life?

30:02.020 --> 30:04.050
I believe we are more
similar than you think.

30:04.100 --> 30:05.500
And what makes you think that?

30:09.220 --> 30:11.740
I cannot pretend to
be as virtuous as you.

30:13.100 --> 30:19.970
But I too have principles, beliefs
that I am prepared to die for.

30:20.020 --> 30:23.090
Atlantis is a great city.

30:23.140 --> 30:26.090
I will not see it destroyed because
Ariadne is too weak to defend it.

30:26.140 --> 30:27.530
She defends it from you.

30:27.580 --> 30:30.170
You think I am the only threat?

30:30.220 --> 30:35.450
Our enemies are watching, they will
seek to exploit Ariadne's weakness.

30:35.500 --> 30:36.730
We cannot let that happen.

30:36.780 --> 30:38.610
Ariadne is the rightful
heir to the throne.

30:38.660 --> 30:40.170
Ariadne's father usurped the King.

30:40.220 --> 30:42.890
She has no more right to the throne
than I. Or you for that matter.

30:42.940 --> 30:45.730
I believe in her. She is
a true and just Queen.

30:45.780 --> 30:47.650
True and just maybe, but weak.

30:47.700 --> 30:50.620
~ She's stronger than you think.
~ Really? I hear she's dying.

30:55.700 --> 30:58.330
You may not believe this,
but I tried with Ariadne.

30:58.380 --> 31:01.730
I treated her like a daughter.
She always resented me.

31:01.780 --> 31:04.770
You have spent so much
of your life lying

31:04.820 --> 31:07.410
that you no longer know
the truth.

31:07.460 --> 31:09.410
Do you always tell the truth?

31:09.460 --> 31:10.970
Tell me. Why are you here?

31:11.020 --> 31:12.330
I came to kill Medea.

31:12.380 --> 31:14.730
And yet you spared her
life? Why is that?

31:14.780 --> 31:16.260
Well, I'm not like you.

31:17.820 --> 31:19.210
You believe we are different,

31:19.260 --> 31:22.010
yet we both wish to
protect Atlantis.

31:22.060 --> 31:25.010
I fight to protect
the people from you.

31:25.060 --> 31:28.930
The people will only be safe
when Atlantis is strong.

31:28.980 --> 31:32.330
If you truly wish to
protect Atlantis,

31:32.380 --> 31:34.540
we must put our differences aside.

31:41.940 --> 31:44.850
Pacing backwards and forwards
like that won't make your wounds

31:44.900 --> 31:46.770
heal any quicker.

31:46.820 --> 31:48.770
The best thing to do is sit still.

31:48.820 --> 31:51.250
How can I sit still now?

31:51.300 --> 31:53.850
Jason should have
been back ages ago.

31:53.900 --> 31:56.060
We have to go after
him. Check me again.

32:00.340 --> 32:03.020
Well? Have I stopped bleeding yet?

32:04.540 --> 32:05.580
It appears so.

32:06.700 --> 32:07.820
We'll soon find out.

32:19.380 --> 32:21.090
It's just a crow.

32:21.140 --> 32:22.180
I hate crows.

32:26.260 --> 32:30.170
So you have nothing better
to do than watch me eat?

32:30.220 --> 32:34.900
I wish to understand you, and
for you to understand me.

32:36.380 --> 32:40.900
You really have no desire to find
common ground, to end the bloodshed?

32:47.260 --> 32:50.370
I came to here looking
for my father.

32:50.420 --> 32:55.410
~ Did you find him? ~ He's
dead. ~ And your mother?

32:55.460 --> 32:57.500
She died shortly after I was born.

32:59.660 --> 33:01.420
You have no memory of her?

33:02.660 --> 33:04.730
None.

33:04.780 --> 33:06.970
Did your father ever speak of her?

33:07.020 --> 33:14.450
I would ask but I think the memory
of her was too painful for him.

33:14.500 --> 33:16.780
Why do you ask all these questions?

33:19.820 --> 33:22.050
Perhaps there is a way that
we can end this, that we

33:22.100 --> 33:25.010
can no longer be enemies.

33:25.060 --> 33:26.260
I don't see how.

33:31.860 --> 33:34.730
I don't believe you're ready to
hear what I need to tell you.

33:34.780 --> 33:36.570
But there will come a time, soon.

33:36.620 --> 33:40.020
Please. I want to
know what you mean.

33:49.180 --> 33:53.380
I am not who you believe me to be.

33:54.460 --> 33:56.610
You are exactly who
I believe you to be.

33:56.660 --> 34:00.020
No, no, no!

34:02.500 --> 34:04.420
~ Are you hurt? ~ Stop! Stop!

34:22.580 --> 34:24.489
It's a patrol.

34:24.540 --> 34:28.969
We'll just have to wait until
they pass. What are they doing?

34:29.020 --> 34:33.290
~ They appear to be stopping for
a rest. ~ Of all the places.

34:33.340 --> 34:35.929
I fear if we try and go
round them we'll be seen.

34:35.980 --> 34:38.770
Jason needs us. We'll
have to take them out.

34:38.820 --> 34:41.409
You can't use your sword. You'll
draw blood. It will attract

34:41.460 --> 34:42.489
the Stymphalian birds.

34:42.540 --> 34:45.170
You expect us to kill an entire
patrol without drawing blood?

34:45.219 --> 34:46.409
It would be preferable.

34:46.460 --> 34:49.449
Not to mention impossible.

34:49.500 --> 34:51.420
We'll just have to wait
until they move on.

34:56.139 --> 34:58.060
There was such hatred in his eyes.

35:02.740 --> 35:04.930
He will only ever see
me as his enemy.

35:04.980 --> 35:07.650
Perhaps with time he will
think of you differently.

35:07.700 --> 35:09.380
I was a fool to believe that.

35:12.340 --> 35:15.380
I cannot permit myself to
have these feelings again.

35:19.700 --> 35:21.370
You're going to kill
him? He is your son.

35:21.420 --> 35:23.820
I lost him the moment his
father took him away from me.

35:28.460 --> 35:30.220
He was dead to me a long time ago.

35:43.980 --> 35:47.130
We'll never make it past them
without the alarm being raised.

35:47.180 --> 35:49.220
Then it seems there's
only one option.

37:14.380 --> 37:18.620
Here you are, in a
cell. What a surprise.

37:22.660 --> 37:25.890
Now, can we get out of here?

37:25.940 --> 37:28.970
~ Where's Medea's blood?
~ I already have it.

37:29.020 --> 37:31.060
At least you succeeded
in doing something.

37:32.940 --> 37:34.900
~ Run! ~ Kill them!

38:02.740 --> 38:03.780
Come on!

38:13.260 --> 38:17.410
So, the witch is dead. No
less than she deserved.

38:17.460 --> 38:19.690
~ She's not dead.
~ I thought you drained her blood?

38:19.740 --> 38:21.770
I didn't drain all of it,
just what we needed.

38:21.820 --> 38:25.010
~ Why did you spare her life?
~ Because I couldn't do it.

38:25.060 --> 38:27.170
Look, it was as the
Grey Sisters said.

38:27.220 --> 38:28.890
I wanted to, but I
couldn't kill her.

38:28.940 --> 38:31.810
It is because of that witch that
the Queen is on her deathbed.

38:31.860 --> 38:35.130
I know, but I sensed
something in her.

38:35.180 --> 38:36.650
And it's not just her.

38:36.700 --> 38:38.370
What do you mean?

38:38.420 --> 38:39.890
Pasiphae.

38:39.940 --> 38:43.530
She could have killed me and yet
she chose to spare my life.

38:43.580 --> 38:45.610
Now why would she do that?

38:45.660 --> 38:49.690
Who can understand the
working's of that woman?

38:49.740 --> 38:52.730
Surely all that matters now
is that you have the blood?

38:52.780 --> 38:55.700
We need to get back to
Atlantis, and to Ariadne.

39:16.900 --> 39:20.490
~ How is she? ~ She is very weak.
She doesn't have long.

39:20.540 --> 39:22.660
~ You have the blood? ~ Yes.

39:57.340 --> 39:59.060
You did everything you could.

40:01.740 --> 40:03.740
What if it's not enough?

40:09.340 --> 40:10.970
The blood has done its work.

40:11.020 --> 40:13.050
Thank the Gods.

40:13.100 --> 40:15.060
The Queen is asking for you.

40:22.820 --> 40:24.900
It seems I am forever in your debt.

40:27.620 --> 40:30.730
You nearly died.

40:30.780 --> 40:35.460
~ And it was my fault.
~ No. Don't think like that.

40:40.740 --> 40:42.890
What scared me the most
was the thought that

40:42.940 --> 40:45.050
I would never see you again.

40:45.100 --> 40:47.180
I was never going to
let that happen.

40:49.220 --> 40:54.850
Because you would do anything
for me. Give your life for mine?

40:54.900 --> 40:57.850
Anything.

40:57.900 --> 41:00.780
I could ask for nothing more.

41:04.140 --> 41:08.420
~ You need to get some rest. ~ Stay.

41:16.220 --> 41:18.580
What I said, in the necropolis.

41:20.060 --> 41:24.580
I meant every word of it. I
won't deny myself any longer.

41:26.820 --> 41:30.210
What is it?

41:30.260 --> 41:31.540
Marry me.

41:37.140 --> 41:40.210
I know you may not feel as you
did before, after how I behaved.

41:40.260 --> 41:43.610
No, it's not that.

41:43.660 --> 41:46.210
Then what is it?

41:46.260 --> 41:49.100
It's just a shock.

41:50.780 --> 41:54.220
You know, it's not every day your
Queen asks you to marry her.

41:56.220 --> 41:58.940
Give me your answer
when you are ready.

42:01.180 --> 42:02.220
I'm ready now.

42:16.220 --> 42:19.460
If Jason takes the throne, Atlantis
will be lost to us for ever.

42:21.260 --> 42:23.380
I would see him die
before that happens.

42:49.500 --> 42:50.890
It's over.

42:50.940 --> 42:53.010
You stupid boy.

42:53.060 --> 42:54.260
It will never be over.
