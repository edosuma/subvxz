The spaghetti sauce on the walls
really ties the room together.

20:55.989 --> 20:57.388
Oh, ha-ha.

20:57.457 --> 20:58.489
So you guys were gone for a long time.

20:58.558 --> 20:59.590
Did you find anything?

20:59.659 --> 21:01.959
We found this...

21:02.028 --> 21:04.161
under Erik and Kate's seats.

21:04.230 --> 21:06.230
(Sal) It's Kate's
handwriting, no doubt.

21:06.299 --> 21:08.532
Any idea what it means?

21:09.602 --> 21:12.003
(Tess) "Saganash"?

21:12.071 --> 21:13.304
It was hidden behind
that hideous picture

21:13.373 --> 21:14.739
of Erik and Kate.

21:20.546 --> 21:21.946
"Saga."

21:22.015 --> 21:23.881
As in "Saganash."

21:23.950 --> 21:26.050
I think something's
happened to Erik and Kate.

21:26.119 --> 21:27.184
Something serious.

21:27.253 --> 21:28.686
I'm calling the police.

21:28.755 --> 21:29.920
(imitating buzzer) Wrong answer.

21:29.989 --> 21:31.322
Huh?

21:31.391 --> 21:32.623
Because they'll call child services,

21:32.692 --> 21:33.824
who will put us in a new foster home.

21:33.893 --> 21:36.260
There is no foster family
that will take all of us.

21:36.329 --> 21:37.161
Which means that...

21:37.230 --> 21:38.462
They'll split us up. No!

21:38.531 --> 21:40.564
Or worse, send us to
Blackfriar's orphanage,

21:40.633 --> 21:41.899
AKA the house of gruel.

21:41.968 --> 21:43.734
(Tess) Nobody's splitting us up.

21:43.803 --> 21:45.303
We all came from different places.

21:45.371 --> 21:46.704
We may not look alike

21:46.773 --> 21:48.406
or have the same blood,
but we're family.

21:48.474 --> 21:50.041
Family stays together, am I right?

21:50.109 --> 21:51.642
Definitely! Right. Sure!

21:53.813 --> 21:57.081
So... what do we do?

21:58.305 --> 22:04.450
