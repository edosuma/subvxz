Maybe he says "good job"
when you do a good job.

00:47.313 --> 00:48.417
Or "attagirl."

00:49.883 --> 00:52.261
I like that, "attagirl."

00:52.652 --> 00:56.122
But one of the most important ways
a boss can show you what you're worth...

00:56.289 --> 00:58.735
...is by how much he pays you.

00:58.892 --> 01:01.566
And, ladies, you are a bargain.

01:01.728 --> 01:04.105
What do you think
the men you work with get paid?

01:04.263 --> 01:07.643
- That isn't a fair comparison.
- Yeah, they do have different jobs.

01:07.801 --> 01:10.748
Right. Jobs you're not allowed to have.

01:14.474 --> 01:18.012
I'd like a list of the men's salaries
for the next meeting.

01:18.178 --> 01:20.522
I think it's time that you see that too.

01:24.150 --> 01:25.959
Well, we're done here.

01:26.119 --> 01:27.723
Keep recruiting, ladies.

01:27.887 --> 01:30.834
Just make sure that they're women
that you trust, okay?

01:30.990 --> 01:33.596
And remember,
there's strength in numbers.

01:33.760 --> 01:35.671
Thank you so much, Eleanor.

01:35.829 --> 01:38.275
- Next week.
- Thank you.

01:42.302 --> 01:46.216
And there must be a list of the salaries
somewhere up in Finn's office.

01:46.372 --> 01:50.650
Oh, sure, just break into Finn's office,
steal some stuff.

01:50.810 --> 01:53.051
Really? Are you Cindy Reston?

01:53.213 --> 01:57.059
Yeah. I'm just discovering
my inner Mata Hari.

01:57.217 --> 02:01.996
And I happen to know
that Angie has an extra set of keys.

02:03.556 --> 02:06.196
I'm gonna duck in here
and get some coffee and doughnuts.

02:06.693 --> 02:07.694
For the office?

02:07.861 --> 02:10.705
No. I wanna go by the headquarters
of the postal strike...

02:10.864 --> 02:13.674
-...see if there's been any developments.
- Again?

02:15.768 --> 02:17.839
- Good night, Patti.
- Good night.

02:41.060 --> 02:43.199
I saved you the chocolate glazed.

02:44.063 --> 02:46.805
Thank you, mami.
How's my favorite pelirroja?

02:46.966 --> 02:50.243
- Good. It's so busy here tonight.
- You have no idea.

02:50.803 --> 02:51.941
Tell me.

03:00.947 --> 03:02.483
News of the Week, this is Gabe.

03:02.649 --> 03:05.220
Gabe, it's Patti.
I'm at the postal strike headquarters.

03:05.385 --> 03:08.059
<i>- Is</i> Doug <i>there?
- No, he left. What are you doing there?</i>

03:08.221 --> 03:10.758
- The strike is going national.
- National?

03:11.257 --> 03:12.861
How do you know? Do you have a--?

03:13.026 --> 03:15.632
It's already spread to Chicago,
Detroit, San Francisco.

03:15.795 --> 03:18.867
Check the wires.
Patti said the mail strike's going national.

03:19.032 --> 03:21.672
It's not gonna be on the wires,
but it is real.

03:21.834 --> 03:24.815
Okay. Uh, I should... I should...

03:24.971 --> 03:28.817
Gabriel, you need to call Finn at home,
then you need to call the bureaus...

03:28.975 --> 03:32.718
wand tell them to send reporters
to get updates. I'll be there in 20 minutes.

04:41.848 --> 04:45.386
- No, he's not in yet.
- Those are the changes right there.

04:48.288 --> 04:49.699
I'll be in my office.

04:53.226 --> 04:55.706
- Morning.
- Morning.

04:55.862 --> 04:57.899
What time did they call you in?

04:58.064 --> 05:01.534
Oh, uh... Just past midnight.

05:05.638 --> 05:06.844
Thanks.

05:07.006 --> 05:08.349
Morning.

05:08.508 --> 05:11.045
- Ahem. Morning.
- Morning.

05:11.210 --> 05:12.985
You look like today's not your friend.

05:13.146 --> 05:15.148
The 4 a.m. get-to-the-office call is tough.

05:15.315 --> 05:18.888
JP's on the Warpath. He thinks the strike
is gonna kill his Joe Namath cover.

05:19.052 --> 05:22.090
- He's been working on it since Christmas.
- It'll eventually run.

05:22.255 --> 05:23.757
Yeah, you can tell him that.

05:29.228 --> 05:32.107
So the D.C. bureau
has the Nixon administration reaction...

05:32.265 --> 05:34.541
...and a report from
the under secretary of labor.

05:35.068 --> 05:37.514
Business? Business.

05:38.037 --> 05:40.643
Right. We want a full spread
on what this means...

05:40.807 --> 05:43.617
...for Wall Street on Monday morning
if this strike is going.

05:43.776 --> 05:46.188
Will blue-chip companies
have problems with payroll?

05:46.346 --> 05:49.293
Call the mortgage lenders.
What's this mean for homeowners?

05:49.449 --> 05:51.429
- It's Saturday.
- You're a hell of a reporter.

05:51.584 --> 05:53.495
- Nobody'll be at work.
- Call them at home.

05:53.653 --> 05:56.896
Donald, Clem, I want you to give me
500 words on the military angle.

05:57.056 --> 06:00.469
Draft notices, letters home.
What else do we need to worry about?

06:00.626 --> 06:04.199
Mail-order catalogs,
social security checks, jury summonses.

06:04.364 --> 06:05.707
Magazine subscriptions.

06:06.432 --> 06:09.902
Gonna be tight sphincters in
a lot of editors' offices before this is over.

06:10.069 --> 06:11.673
Mine's been clenched since '67.

06:13.072 --> 06:14.415
You're on the main block.

06:14.574 --> 06:17.646
Go to strike HQ. We'll build the skeleton
of this with the wires...

06:17.810 --> 06:21.314
-...but you'll add the flesh and heartbeat.
- Can Doug handle another cover?

06:21.481 --> 06:24.121
Namath is the cover.
But Doug's Black Panther story...

06:24.283 --> 06:25.819
...was dynamite. Kid's on a roll.

06:25.985 --> 06:28.192
What about the guy in charge
of the mailmen?

06:28.354 --> 06:30.425
It's a wildcat strike,
workers are in charge.

06:30.590 --> 06:32.866
Twenty-thousand workers
don't just march in step.

06:33.025 --> 06:36.404
Somebody's leading them, find out who.
Sam, I wanna run this picture.

06:36.562 --> 06:40.009
Jersey City post office with so much
backed-up mail, it won't fit indoors.

06:40.166 --> 06:42.009
Get down there,
write me something good.

06:42.168 --> 06:43.408
I didn't see that.

06:43.569 --> 06:47.779
If we could find a way to distract Angie,
then I could get into her desk.

06:47.940 --> 06:51.444
You'd also have to distract Finn
so you can get the files out of his office.

06:51.611 --> 06:53.090
- That's true.
- I can't help you.

06:53.246 --> 06:56.455
- I've had enough adventure for a decade.
- That's fair.

07:24.010 --> 07:25.080
Shit.

07:25.244 --> 07:28.657
This is breaking news, but it doesn't
mean you write like an AP reporter.

07:28.815 --> 07:29.953
You keep it sexy.

07:30.116 --> 07:32.756
If I don't wanna fuck your story,
I don't wanna run it.

07:32.919 --> 07:36.298
That's a pretty low bar. Gregory wants
to screw anything that moves.

07:36.622 --> 07:38.295
All right, that's it. Thanks, boys.

07:38.658 --> 07:39.898
Go.

07:43.229 --> 07:44.401
JP.

07:44.564 --> 07:47.443
- This strike--
- Take it easy. Namath is still the cover.

07:47.600 --> 07:51.104
You know this mail strike is bullshit.
It's illegal. They're civil servants.

07:51.270 --> 07:53.409
Nixon will be thrilled
that you're on his side.

07:53.573 --> 07:55.985
I'll let him know. Next time I talk to him.

07:56.142 --> 07:58.918
What a waste.
Sending you to strike headquarters.

07:59.078 --> 08:02.287
Shipping me off to Jersey City
to investigate the urgent crisis...

08:02.448 --> 08:03.984
...of undelivered Sears catalogs.

08:04.150 --> 08:06.756
You had your turn, teacher's pet.
This is my year.

08:06.919 --> 08:08.796
Fuck it, this is my decade.

08:08.955 --> 08:11.333
It's a little early to be calling
the whole decade.

08:11.491 --> 08:14.904
- It's not even February yet.
- Come on. Squash my high.

08:15.061 --> 08:16.972
So when are we going to strike HQ?

08:19.031 --> 08:21.944
Oh, come on, do not leave me behind.
Give a girl a break.

08:22.101 --> 08:23.705
Patti, our deadline's in 14 hours.

08:23.870 --> 08:26.476
I'll call you with my first lines of copy
before lunch.

08:26.639 --> 08:29.119
It'll be mayhem.
Nobody knows who's calling the shots.

08:29.275 --> 08:31.585
Yeah, but I know those guys.
Mickey is my buddy.

08:31.744 --> 08:33.347
Is Mickey the guy in charge there?

08:33.513 --> 08:35.288
Listen to me.

08:35.448 --> 08:37.086
Everybody knows you got it first.

08:37.250 --> 08:41.562
You beat every wire service on the telex
to a national story. You did good.

08:43.589 --> 08:45.466
I'm not leaving you behind.

08:46.025 --> 08:47.231
We're doing this together.

08:53.266 --> 08:56.804
You wanna try and rebuild the whole front
of the book in the next 18 hours?

08:56.969 --> 08:59.813
Time went to press last night.
Their ship has sailed.

08:59.972 --> 09:03.181
They probably didn't pay attention
to a local New York labor story...

09:03.342 --> 09:04.980
...which is all this was yesterday.

09:05.144 --> 09:06.680
- I'm at your service.
- Good.

09:06.846 --> 09:09.258
I've spent 400 goddamn Saturdays
at this magazine...

09:09.415 --> 09:10.951
...waiting for moments like this.

09:11.117 --> 09:14.929
We have 24 extra hours to get the scoop
on a story Time can't touch.

09:15.087 --> 09:16.589
Christ, this feels good.

09:21.093 --> 09:24.563
Great. We'll be there in about
45 minutes, depending on traffic.

09:26.632 --> 09:28.111
Hollander.

09:28.267 --> 09:29.268
Get your coat.

09:30.703 --> 09:33.479
- I need to finish reading--
- Whatever you're doing can wait.

09:33.639 --> 09:36.051
We are going to beautiful
Jersey City, New Jersey...

09:36.242 --> 09:38.381
-...to see about some mail.
- What kind of mail?

09:38.544 --> 09:41.024
Undelivered mail. Piles and piles of it.

09:41.581 --> 09:43.993
- But what's the story?
- There's no damn story there.

09:44.150 --> 09:45.458
Finn just likes the picture.

09:45.618 --> 09:48.599
- We're writing the world's longest caption.
- Why am I coming?

09:48.754 --> 09:51.200
Why you worried?
Is your boyfriend gonna be jealous?

09:51.891 --> 09:55.031
- No, no, no, I just--
- Good. Lobby in two.

10:02.702 --> 10:04.682
I can't believe I didn't check the stalls.

10:04.837 --> 10:08.751
- How much did she hear?
- I don't know. Enough.

10:08.908 --> 10:11.889
I mean, we just--
We can't risk her telling anyone.

10:12.044 --> 10:16.083
We have to tell her what we're doing
and ask her to join.

10:16.716 --> 10:19.822
- I just wish I knew her better.
- Me too.

10:19.986 --> 10:21.488
If we get her on board...

10:21.654 --> 10:24.464
...we might get her two friends too.
They're always together.

10:24.624 --> 10:26.626
<i>- I'll see if I can talk to her.
- I'll</i> do <i>it.</i>

10:28.127 --> 10:29.606
What?

10:30.429 --> 10:34.309
After what happened to Diane
at New Year's...

10:34.467 --> 10:38.472
...some of the girls are a little wary.

10:38.638 --> 10:41.084
- Of me?
- Yeah, yeah, yes.

10:41.240 --> 10:43.186
I didn't push her down the stairs.

10:43.342 --> 10:45.083
I know. I know that.

10:45.244 --> 10:49.454
And-- And she knows that.
You know, it's just a-- It's just a feeling.

10:49.615 --> 10:50.889
It will pass.

10:51.050 --> 10:52.791
Good luck.

11:11.370 --> 11:13.611
We'll start with a wide shot
across the street.

11:14.440 --> 11:16.351
Mr. Lemerson.

11:16.509 --> 11:18.045
Screw it.

11:19.111 --> 11:20.681
There's only so much you can take.

11:20.846 --> 11:24.692
When the United States Congress votes
themselves a 41 percent pay raise...

11:24.850 --> 11:28.388
...while year after year we get 1 percent,
2 percent? What do they expect?

11:28.554 --> 11:31.194
Your own union leadership
is against the strike.

11:31.357 --> 11:33.860
We're on strike,
maybe they're not leaders after all.

11:34.060 --> 11:37.633
A lot of the guys say they come to you
for guidance, that you're in charge.

11:37.797 --> 11:40.471
I'm just a letter carrier.
Twenty-five years on the job...

11:40.633 --> 11:43.773
-...and not in anybody's pocket.
- You think your union leadership...

11:43.936 --> 11:47.076
-...is in management's pocket?
- Ha, ha. Careful, now. I didn't say that.

11:47.239 --> 11:50.118
If you put those words in my mouth,
I'll come looking for you.

11:50.276 --> 11:52.586
- I'm a mailman, I can find you.
- A-ha.

11:52.812 --> 11:54.314
- Well, Vinnie...
- Yeah?

11:54.480 --> 11:57.484
...it's your lucky day.
It all comes down to leadership.

11:57.650 --> 12:00.824
Whether you like it or not,
you're the leader of this thing.

12:00.986 --> 12:05.662
Being a letter carrier is a good job.
It should be better.

12:05.825 --> 12:07.827
Our union leadership has failed us.

12:10.162 --> 12:11.197
Hm.

<i>Letter carriers out on strike.</i>

You were a huge help
when you met with Noah.

12:36.122 --> 12:37.658
People like talking to you.

12:39.058 --> 12:41.231
Well, I am a good listener.

12:41.994 --> 12:44.270
That's what happens when
you grow up with a lisp.

12:44.964 --> 12:47.240
- You did not.
- Mm-hm.

12:47.533 --> 12:50.446
Well, I took elocution lessons
three times a week for months...

12:50.603 --> 12:52.207
...and I rather excelled at it.

12:52.371 --> 12:55.545
I wanna hear the lisp.
Let's dust that off and take it for a spin.

12:55.708 --> 12:58.018
- Oh, no. No, don't make fun.
- No, I'm not, I--

12:59.011 --> 13:01.719
Hell, I wore the shoes
with the bar in between them.

13:01.881 --> 13:05.226
Oh, no. I know that bar.
My little cousin had that bar.

13:05.384 --> 13:07.489
It's a fucking torture device.

13:07.653 --> 13:10.429
I fell on my face,
knocked my two front teeth out.

13:10.589 --> 13:12.227
Then I had a lisp.

13:13.993 --> 13:16.132
That's nice to hear.

13:16.629 --> 13:19.508
- What's that?
- Your laugh.

13:20.065 --> 13:23.808
It seems like you've been
a bit down lately.

13:24.069 --> 13:27.414
Well, you're sweet to worry,
but everything is great.

13:28.607 --> 13:31.144
- Well, let's go see some mail.
- Mm-hm.

13:32.845 --> 13:37.453
<i>Living wage is all right.

13:38.317 --> 13:40.923
- Nice hat.
- They're postal workers.

13:41.086 --> 13:43.828
They won't judge a man
who knows how to keep his ears warm.

13:43.989 --> 13:47.061
- Letter carriers out <i>on</i> strike.
- You ain't gonna get your mail!

13:47.226 --> 13:49.832
So, what do you think?

13:54.366 --> 13:56.972
I appreciate the cause,
but I have responsibilities.

13:57.136 --> 13:59.082
I can't afford to lose this job.

13:59.238 --> 14:00.308
Of course.

14:00.472 --> 14:04.352
Look, I understand,
it is a delicate situation...

14:04.510 --> 14:07.582
...but if you were to join the group,
it would actually help.

14:07.746 --> 14:09.555
But I can't.

14:09.715 --> 14:13.128
Right, but see, our lawyer says that
there is strength in numbers--

14:13.285 --> 14:15.265
No. Thank you.

14:15.921 --> 14:17.764
But you--

14:18.858 --> 14:21.771
You won't tell anyone, will you?

14:22.328 --> 14:24.808
You don't have to worry about me,
Cindy.

14:30.736 --> 14:32.773
- Oh, Diane, let me help you.
- I've got it.

14:32.938 --> 14:36.317
- No, but I can at least hold this--
- I've got it.

14:41.814 --> 14:44.124
- Diane hates me.
- Um...

14:45.084 --> 14:50.762
Walk with me. I have a photo editor
that wants coffee and captions.

14:50.923 --> 14:55.804
Also, if it makes you feel any better,
I got exactly nowhere with Denise.

14:55.961 --> 14:59.499
- She isn't gonna tell anybody, is she?
- She said I didn't have to worry.

15:00.466 --> 15:01.877
- I'm worried.
- Me too.

15:02.034 --> 15:05.140
Even if she tells one of her friends,
they could tell somebody.

15:07.373 --> 15:08.784
- Oh.
- Mm.

15:13.579 --> 15:15.149
- Patti Robinson.
- You ready?

15:15.314 --> 15:16.418
What do you have for me?

15:16.582 --> 15:19.188
<i>I need everything you can find
on Vincent Paganino.</i>

15:19.351 --> 15:23.595
P-A-G-A-N-I-N-O. Lives in Astoria,
served in the Pacific, he's a letter carrier.

15:23.756 --> 15:26.930
- What am <i>I</i> looking for?
- I don't know yet, but I think he's our guy.

15:27.092 --> 15:30.972
I can't talk, there's a line of guys waiting.
Somebody jammed the phone-booth door.

15:31.130 --> 15:33.132
Make them wait. Give me some color.

15:33.299 --> 15:35.643
They're pissed-off postmen
and they're not budging.

15:35.801 --> 15:37.872
They got serious complaints,
serious demands.

15:38.037 --> 15:41.883
- They <i>want</i> more <i>money?</i>
- Yeah, money for sure, but it's deeper.

15:42.341 --> 15:45.288
These guys do a vital job.
They-- They want respect.

15:45.444 --> 15:49.324
I'll have you know that we always make
cookies for Mr. Sullivan at Christmas.

15:49.481 --> 15:53.224
I'm sure that made up for slave wages and
horrible working conditions. You ready?

15:53.385 --> 15:56.457
I got three graphs plus some good quotes
to work in the body later.

15:56.622 --> 15:57.862
<i>Hit me.</i>

15:58.023 --> 16:00.833
When Vincent Paganino
returned from the Pacific in 1945...

16:00.993 --> 16:02.973
...he knew he wanted
to stay close to home.

16:03.128 --> 16:06.507
The war had taught him to appreciate
things too often taken for granted.

16:07.700 --> 16:10.112
Send Charlie up, will you? Thanks.

16:17.176 --> 16:18.587
Charlie, put this on the wall.

16:18.744 --> 16:21.623
- Where's Washington on their file?
<i>- I'll</i> find out.

16:22.381 --> 16:24.292
- Here's the--
- Why am I suddenly famished?

16:24.450 --> 16:27.954
Gregory ordered 11 pepperoni pizzas.
They're downstairs.

16:38.464 --> 16:39.807
I have Doug's top.

16:39.965 --> 16:44.004
- Great. What did he tell you?
- I wouldn't expect the mail anytime soon.

16:44.470 --> 16:47.849
Is this bad for us? The strike, I mean.
Is it bad for the magazine?

16:48.374 --> 16:51.480
Today it's great.
If it's still going on this time next week...

16:51.643 --> 16:54.852
...we're all gonna be wearing our belts
a little tighter this spring.

16:56.682 --> 16:59.060
Rudderless.
At times, the union appears rudderless.

16:59.218 --> 17:01.095
You can take Doug Rhodes
off the water...

17:01.253 --> 17:03.824
...but you can't take the seaman
out of Doug Rhodes.

17:04.256 --> 17:06.361
That was wrong. I said that wrong.

17:06.525 --> 17:08.732
Tell Doug this is inspired.
Keep going, just...

17:08.894 --> 17:10.771
...stay away
from the nautical metaphors.

17:11.296 --> 17:12.297
Yeah.

17:13.365 --> 17:15.140
Thanks, Patti.

17:39.124 --> 17:42.230
- Hello, Denise.
- Hello.

17:42.895 --> 17:44.374
Gosh...

17:44.530 --> 17:48.171
...no matter how crazy it gets
around here, you never seem stressed.

17:48.333 --> 17:49.676
I like when it's busy.

17:49.835 --> 17:52.907
Me too. It's exciting.

17:54.640 --> 17:56.642
- So, Denise.
- Hm?

17:56.809 --> 17:59.756
Cindy said she talked to you
about how some of the researchers--

17:59.912 --> 18:02.392
You shouldn't be talking
about that here.

18:03.482 --> 18:05.155
I told Cindy I wasn't interested.

18:05.317 --> 18:07.854
I know. I just thought
maybe if you came to a meeting--

18:08.020 --> 18:09.897
Of course I'll fact-check those figures.

18:10.055 --> 18:12.399
I have a call into
the Department of Labor already.

18:12.558 --> 18:15.095
That would be a huge help. Thank you.

18:19.131 --> 18:20.235
I'll keep your secret.

18:20.399 --> 18:22.970
But I don't have the luxury
of believing in your cause.

18:23.135 --> 18:26.048
I am a black woman
working at a white magazine.

18:26.205 --> 18:27.206
A white magazine?

18:27.372 --> 18:29.511
Your story on the Black Panthers
called them...

18:29.675 --> 18:32.349
...the most important organization
for black civil rights.

18:32.511 --> 18:34.286
- Right.
- Did any black people...

18:34.446 --> 18:38.360
...have anything to do with researching,
writing, or editing that story?

18:46.825 --> 18:48.236
Oh...

18:49.027 --> 18:53.066
So is it the same union here
in New Jersey and in New York?

18:53.232 --> 18:55.405
Yeah. I mean, it's our local.

18:55.567 --> 18:59.447
It's your local union, but there's a union
for the whole United States?

18:59.605 --> 19:01.209
Yeah, we all support each other.

19:01.373 --> 19:03.546
Just tell us a little bit about yourself.

19:03.709 --> 19:06.383
MAILMAN; I mean, some guys
like to sort, you know?

19:06.545 --> 19:08.388
I'm a carry guy. I like the fresh air.

19:08.547 --> 19:10.117
Sure.

19:10.449 --> 19:12.292
Here it is.

19:14.486 --> 19:16.466
And there's twice as much
stacked inside.

19:16.622 --> 19:18.101
Oh, wow!

19:18.257 --> 19:20.396
Pile's even bigger in person.

19:20.559 --> 19:23.199
Do you mind if I stay back here
and make a few notes?

19:23.362 --> 19:25.842
- Sure thing.
- Thanks.

19:27.799 --> 19:29.904
So many people
won't be getting their mail.

19:30.469 --> 19:33.507
Well, they will eventually.
If the strike ever ends.

19:34.206 --> 19:36.482
It's so sad, isn't it?

19:36.642 --> 19:40.522
All these words, lost.

19:40.879 --> 19:42.859
This isn't far.

19:43.382 --> 19:47.592
What do you say we deliver some mail
to the good people of New Jersey?

19:48.420 --> 19:49.694
That's illegal, isn't it?

19:49.855 --> 19:52.859
It's illegal to open it or forge it
or blackmail people with it.

19:53.025 --> 19:56.837
We're just gonna deliver it,
talk to some folks, maybe get a story.

19:57.062 --> 20:00.305
Okay. But if we get caught,
you're taking the rap.

20:00.866 --> 20:03.073
You'll still visit me in the slammer,
right?

20:03.235 --> 20:04.771
If you're lucky.

20:05.971 --> 20:08.451
<i>Read your postal worker's rights.</i>

20:08.607 --> 20:11.679
<i>Better wages, better life.
Read your postal worker's rights.</i>

20:18.116 --> 20:22.155
- What do you mean, you can't find her?
- Hi. I'm here.

20:23.288 --> 20:25.894
I brought you a sandwich,
and the military records...

20:26.058 --> 20:28.004
...of Sergeant Vincent Paganino.

20:29.761 --> 20:32.332
- What'd you find?
- He's a bona fide war hero.

20:33.232 --> 20:34.233
Come here.

20:40.005 --> 20:42.383
- Tell me.
- He won the Navy Cross for heroism.

20:42.541 --> 20:43.576
Guadalcanal.

20:43.742 --> 20:45.653
I'll be damned.
He's a humble son of a bitch.

20:45.811 --> 20:49.281
He saved his entire unit
by storming the enemy gun position.

20:49.448 --> 20:50.620
That sound like your guy?

20:51.250 --> 20:52.888
He did lead the walkout.

20:53.051 --> 20:55.691
He's not even a union official,
he's just rank and file.

20:55.854 --> 20:59.461
He stood up and spoke his mind before
the vote, everybody said "right on"...

21:00.292 --> 21:03.000
...and all of a sudden,
they had their leader. There he is.

21:04.096 --> 21:07.407
Take these over to Ray.
Come right back.

21:07.699 --> 21:10.509
He looks so regular.

21:10.669 --> 21:14.674
What is it about a guy like Vinnie
that makes people wanna follow him?

21:15.073 --> 21:16.848
I think they relate to him.

21:17.109 --> 21:18.611
He's one of their own.

21:22.881 --> 21:25.361
You know, I came to The Chelsea
on New Year's.

21:26.251 --> 21:27.457
Really?

21:27.619 --> 21:29.030
Yeah.

21:29.288 --> 21:30.733
That place was nuts.

21:31.323 --> 21:33.269
Yeah, it was.

21:35.027 --> 21:36.768
I looked for you.

21:41.266 --> 21:43.542
I wish you'd found me.

21:46.238 --> 21:47.740
Me too.

22:04.589 --> 22:07.069
- Hello.
- Oh. Oh!

22:07.259 --> 22:09.034
Hi. Hello.

22:09.561 --> 22:11.507
What can I do for you?

22:11.663 --> 22:14.337
You know, act-- You know, I was just--

22:14.499 --> 22:19.209
I was actually just here
to try to eavesdrop.

22:20.572 --> 22:24.850
You know, because of the cover.
Every-- Everyone downstairs is just...

22:25.010 --> 22:27.456
...dying to know if it's changing. Ha, ha.

22:27.612 --> 22:29.523
Right. I don't think Finn's decided yet.

22:29.681 --> 22:31.183
<i>Okay-</i>

22:31.350 --> 22:32.351
Well, thank you.

22:38.557 --> 22:43.233
Here we have the Johnson family
of Maple Terrace.

22:43.395 --> 22:47.002
He's got a utility bill,
a notice from the rotary club...

22:47.165 --> 22:49.975
And a card from Virginia Johnson
in Des Moines.

22:50.135 --> 22:53.412
- Ginny Johnson. Sounds like a goer.
- Sam.

22:58.009 --> 22:59.283
- Yes?
- Hi.

22:59.444 --> 23:01.583
I'm Jane Hollander
and this is Sam Rosenberg...

23:01.747 --> 23:04.091
...and we work at News of the Week,
the magazine.

23:04.249 --> 23:06.820
- We don't get that magazine.
- Then you're missing out.

23:06.985 --> 23:11.058
We're writing a story on the postal strike.
We brought your mail from the post office.

23:11.223 --> 23:13.760
Oh, thank you so much.

23:14.559 --> 23:16.129
Was there anything else?

23:16.294 --> 23:18.171
Something you were expecting
didn't come?

23:18.330 --> 23:21.311
My dad's pension check.
It usually comes Thursday or Friday.

23:23.368 --> 23:25.245
We'll be all right for a while.

23:25.904 --> 23:27.975
Just wish this thing
would be over already.

23:38.116 --> 23:39.754
So, what are we thinking, Gregory?

23:40.385 --> 23:42.422
I don't know. I think it's the way to go.

23:42.587 --> 23:44.328
There's stronger images,
but ultimately--

23:44.489 --> 23:46.765
- It's strong.
- Put it up in your locker.

23:46.925 --> 23:49.201
It'll be hard to make the mail
as sexy as Namath.

23:49.361 --> 23:52.808
It's not the mail, it's the strike.
The nation at a standstill.

23:54.933 --> 23:57.573
Hey, Cindy.
Gregory, this is Cindy Reston.

23:57.736 --> 24:00.717
Of course. You didn't think
a reporter worth his salt...

24:00.872 --> 24:03.785
...could spend three weeks here
and fail to notice Cindy?

24:03.942 --> 24:05.683
- How can we help you, Cindy?
<i>_Um__</i>

24:06.111 --> 24:08.785
The president is going on TV...

24:08.947 --> 24:11.791
...to address the nation at 4:30
about the strike.

24:11.950 --> 24:13.861
- Wow!
- Is that confirmed?

24:14.019 --> 24:17.865
Yeah, I heard from my friend at CBS,
and Dottie confirmed with D.C.

24:18.490 --> 24:21.232
- It's gonna be the cover.
- Depending on what Nixon says.

24:21.393 --> 24:23.839
- It doesn't matter what he says.
- Of course it does.

24:23.995 --> 24:27.909
- These don't work. We need a new photo.
- I'm expecting pictures from Chicago.

24:28.066 --> 24:32.537
It's okay you don't have a picture.
That's okay. Make the words count.

24:33.572 --> 24:36.985
It's a cover.
It's-- It's all about the image.

24:41.146 --> 24:42.216
Mm.

24:42.380 --> 24:44.155
Son of a bitch, I like it.

24:44.316 --> 24:47.024
But this stays until I hear the president.

25:02.100 --> 25:04.080
Hello, ladies.

25:20.018 --> 25:24.228
Patti. Nixon's going on TV at 4:30
to talk postal strike.

25:24.389 --> 25:26.869
Today? I just came from
postal strike headquarters.

25:27.025 --> 25:30.996
- They're not going back to work soon.
- Sorry, is--? Is that Doug's writing?

25:31.162 --> 25:33.438
- How can you even read that?
- It's terrible.

25:33.598 --> 25:36.943
I've learned how to decipher it.
"Mr. Paganino has emerged...

25:37.102 --> 25:41.448
...as the true leader of the local 36th,
though he's won no election...

25:41.606 --> 25:45.645
...his loyalists say he's the only union
leader who understands them." See?

25:46.778 --> 25:49.088
- Impressive. Heh.
- Thank you.

25:52.951 --> 25:54.760
- Cindy.
- Yeah.

25:54.920 --> 25:56.797
What time did you say
Nixon was going on?

25:56.955 --> 25:58.957
- Four-thirty.
- For how long?

25:59.124 --> 26:02.264
My friend at CBS says
they've blocked out 15 minutes.

26:08.800 --> 26:10.279
Uh-huh.

26:16.708 --> 26:18.119
This should be interesting.

26:19.010 --> 26:20.956
It's from Vietnam.

26:31.222 --> 26:32.599
What is it?

26:34.292 --> 26:36.203
- Um...
- Good afternoon, ma'am.

26:36.361 --> 26:39.774
We are delivering some mail
on behalf of the U.S. postal service.

26:39.931 --> 26:43.140
The strike's not over,
but we know how important mail can be.

26:52.177 --> 26:53.713
Look.

26:58.350 --> 27:00.387
Oh, how awful.

27:10.061 --> 27:14.532
Wait. Do you want to interview her?
Not for this, but for our vet piece.

27:14.699 --> 27:16.337
No.

27:28.246 --> 27:31.489
And the salary goes up
by what percentage each year?

27:34.185 --> 27:36.358
And is there a cap on that?

27:42.727 --> 27:45.503
I'm sorry, could you confirm
the spelling of your last name?

27:47.198 --> 27:49.269
Don't make any changes
to that location.

27:49.434 --> 27:51.004
<i>We go now to the president.</i>

27:51.169 --> 27:52.239
<i>My fellow Americans...</i>

27:53.605 --> 27:54.606
Hey, he's on.

27:54.773 --> 27:57.276
<i>--developments
on the postal work stoppage...</i>

27:57.442 --> 28:00.719
<i>...and on the actions
I have decided to take.</i>

28:00.879 --> 28:04.884
<i>First, the overwhelming majority
of postal workers across the nation...</i>

28:05.050 --> 28:06.757
<i>...remain on their jobs...</i>

28:06.918 --> 28:10.593
<i>upholding their tradition and their oath
to support the constitution...</i>

28:10.755 --> 28:15.636
I was wondering
if I could watch the speech in here...

28:16.094 --> 28:17.402
...with you.

28:17.562 --> 28:20.065
- I was hoping for some company.
- Mm.

28:20.432 --> 28:25.313
<i>However, in several large cities,
the post offices are shut down.</i>

28:25.470 --> 28:29.111
<i>In New York, for example,
the mail system is wholly paralyzed...</i>

28:29.274 --> 28:32.778
<i>...by illegal walkout,
and essential services have been...</i>

28:32.944 --> 28:35.117
I can't stop thinking about it.

28:35.280 --> 28:38.523
- Last Saturday, <i>I</i> pledged to the nation...
- About what?

28:38.683 --> 28:42.290
<i>...that if the current situation
existed on Monday, today...</i>

28:42.454 --> 28:44.593
- Oh, yeah?
----that I would take action-

28:44.756 --> 28:46.099
You liked that, huh?

28:46.257 --> 28:50.137
<i>It's my constitutional obligation
to move the mail...</i>

28:50.395 --> 28:53.933
<i>...and I am taking that action now.</i>

28:54.632 --> 28:57.909
<i>Injunctions have been sought,
and in most cases already granted...</i>

28:58.069 --> 29:01.744
<i>...forbidding striking postal workers
from interfering with those...</i>

29:01.906 --> 29:04.113
<i>...who wish to return to work.</i>

29:04.275 --> 29:07.279
<i>I've directed the attorney general
to take whatever action...</i>

29:07.445 --> 29:11.916
<i>believes necessary to see
that these court orders are obeyed.</i>

29:12.083 --> 29:13.960
<i>And working with
local law enforcement...</i>

29:14.119 --> 29:20.627
<i>...to see that no illegal picket lines
interfere with workers returning to work.</i>

29:20.792 --> 29:25.366
<i>Secondly, I have just now
directed the activation...</i>

29:25.530 --> 29:28.807
<i>...of the men of the various
military organizations...</i>

29:28.967 --> 29:33.211
<i>...to begin in New York City,
the restoration of essential...</i>

29:33.371 --> 29:35.442
What else
can't you stop thinking about?

29:37.142 --> 29:38.678
This?

29:39.878 --> 29:42.825
This is very thought provoking.

29:43.281 --> 29:44.954
Right there?

29:49.120 --> 29:50.531
Right there.

29:52.023 --> 29:53.866
I don't know.

29:54.025 --> 29:57.131
If you don't know, no one does.

29:57.529 --> 30:01.272
<i>These replacements are being sent in
as a supplemental workforce...</i>

30:01.432 --> 30:04.379
<i>...to maintain essential services.</i>

30:04.536 --> 30:07.016
That was my second guess.

30:07.305 --> 30:10.479
--As <i>are necessary to accomplish that
will be used.</i>

30:10.642 --> 30:12.485
Does that feel good?

30:12.644 --> 30:15.591
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

30:15.747 --> 30:17.852
Yeah? Come here.

30:18.082 --> 30:19.686
This'll feel even better.

30:20.118 --> 30:24.157
<i>--To both the postal workers
who have stayed on the job...</i>

30:24.322 --> 30:28.429
<i>poor depend heavily upon it
for medical services...</i>

30:28.593 --> 30:30.539
<i>...and also for government assistance.</i>

30:31.663 --> 30:35.167
<i>Veterans depend upon it
for their compensation checks.</i>

30:35.333 --> 30:38.337
- The elderly depend <i>upon it...</i>
- Denise, this is our lawyer.

30:38.503 --> 30:41.245
- This is Eleanor Holmes Norton.
- Hello, Denise.

30:41.406 --> 30:44.546
I'm sorry, I mean no disrespect,
but I thought I was clear.

30:44.709 --> 30:46.689
You were, but she--

30:46.845 --> 30:48.825
You can't knock a girl for trying,
can you?

30:48.980 --> 30:51.859
Especially for a cause
she believes you're sympathetic to?

30:52.016 --> 30:54.257
Nobody will be looking for you
while Nixon's on.

30:54.419 --> 30:57.332
I called the D.C. bureau
and got the full text of his speech...

30:57.488 --> 30:59.832
...so you will be current
on what he said.

31:01.125 --> 31:03.833
I don't need to explain to you
the historic significance...

31:03.995 --> 31:05.872
...of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.

31:07.065 --> 31:12.071
Good, because I'd rather tell you
how we as women can utilize that law...

31:12.237 --> 31:14.945
...to change the world, together.

31:15.573 --> 31:19.043
<i>For the past year,
almost since the day we took office...</i>

31:19.210 --> 31:21.884
- They aren't gonna run it.
- How do you know?

31:22.046 --> 31:23.821
Because I know.

31:24.883 --> 31:28.922
They don't want my 500-word ode to
the cultural significance of mail delivery.

31:29.087 --> 31:30.896
Not sexy enough.

31:31.055 --> 31:33.661
Well, I thought it was beautiful.

31:34.859 --> 31:36.270
Can I ask you something?

31:37.161 --> 31:38.299
Always.

31:38.696 --> 31:42.439
Why didn't you wanna interview
the woman with the letter from Vietnam?

31:44.736 --> 31:47.148
I grew up around sad people.

31:47.305 --> 31:49.512
Most of my family
didn't make it out of Europe.

31:49.674 --> 31:52.120
- I'm so sorry.
- I didn't know any of them.

31:52.510 --> 31:55.719
I mean, it still screwed me up,
but that's not the point.

31:56.414 --> 31:58.792
The one thing you learn
when you grow up...

31:59.083 --> 32:01.689
...around that kind of pain...

32:03.187 --> 32:05.030
...is that it has to be respected.

32:06.557 --> 32:10.437
With people in pain, you, uh, can't fix it.

32:11.462 --> 32:13.533
Can't make them forget it.

32:14.098 --> 32:16.510
You can't take it away from them.

32:17.101 --> 32:20.514
All you really can do
is treat it with respect.

32:22.240 --> 32:25.585
As a reporter,
sometimes that's not possible, but...

32:25.843 --> 32:27.754
We didn't need that story.

32:28.313 --> 32:29.621
Not today.

32:37.322 --> 32:41.168
I forget how pleasant it is
to get out of the office sometimes.

32:43.995 --> 32:46.703
Goodness, look at me. I'm so sorry.

32:51.502 --> 32:54.312
I have been down a little lately.

32:55.573 --> 32:56.813
I'm so sorry.

32:57.608 --> 32:59.144
Why?

33:01.479 --> 33:03.789
I broke up with Chad.

33:05.550 --> 33:12.729
Things weren't, um, moving forward
as I had expected them to, so...

33:14.392 --> 33:16.201
Damn it.

33:18.663 --> 33:20.267
You know, the truth is...

33:22.834 --> 33:25.747
The truth is he dumped me.

33:26.738 --> 33:29.275
On New Year's Eve, no less.

33:30.808 --> 33:32.446
Well, then, he isn't worthy of you.

33:35.680 --> 33:37.421
Thank you.

33:38.850 --> 33:40.659
<i>--Immediately after postal workers...</i>

33:40.818 --> 33:44.994
Think about what it means
for people to see black postal workers...

33:45.156 --> 33:47.432
...standing alongside white ones.

33:47.859 --> 33:51.602
People see that and they know the postal
worker's cause is a righteous one.

33:51.763 --> 33:53.436
- Just like ours.
- Mrs. Norton--

33:53.598 --> 33:54.702
Eleanor, please.

33:55.900 --> 33:57.538
Eleanor...

33:57.902 --> 33:59.779
...as one colored woman to another...

33:59.937 --> 34:02.747
...I must say that I don't equate
a job at the post office...

34:02.907 --> 34:06.616
...a position my own father could
only dream of, with helping these women.

34:06.778 --> 34:10.225
Most of whom are here as a finishing
school before they move to Greenwich.

34:10.380 --> 34:12.190
And as one colored woman
to another...

34:12.350 --> 34:16.321
...I understand how you would feel
like this is not your fight, but, sister...

34:16.487 --> 34:18.228
...I'm here to tell you that it is.

34:18.389 --> 34:23.463
See, these women have something
very important in common with us.

34:23.628 --> 34:25.665
They're second-class citizens.

34:25.830 --> 34:28.275
And you and I know exactly
how that feels, don't we?

34:28.800 --> 34:32.748
Kept from your full potential.
Paid less than you're worth.

34:32.904 --> 34:37.250
Talked down to.
Told to shut up and stay in your place.

34:37.408 --> 34:40.411
These women live in a box,
just like you.

34:40.578 --> 34:44.424
So don't be fooled because their box
looks a little more comfortable than yours.

34:44.581 --> 34:45.583
It's still a box.

34:47.185 --> 34:50.598
And the only way any of us break out
of this box is if we stand together.

34:50.755 --> 34:54.259
Because when the second-class citizens
of the world stand with each other...

34:54.425 --> 34:57.963
...not against each other,
that's how you change the world.

34:58.129 --> 35:01.269
So when you help these women,
Denise...

35:01.432 --> 35:03.139
...the person you free is yourself.

35:06.370 --> 35:08.281
<i>What is at issue then...</i>

35:08.439 --> 35:13.411
<i>...is the survive!
of a government based upon law.</i>

35:13.611 --> 35:17.855
<i>Essential services
must be maintained.</i>

35:18.015 --> 35:22.725
<i>And as president, I shall meet
my constitutional responsibility...</i>

35:22.887 --> 35:26.960
<i>...to see that those services
are maintained.</i>

35:27.525 --> 35:33.305
<i>And I'm asking for the understanding
and support of every American...</i>

35:33.464 --> 35:38.038
<i>...in this decision that I have made
on behalf of our country.</i>

35:38.202 --> 35:40.580
<i>You've heard the president...</i>

35:40.805 --> 35:42.807
Ladies and gentlemen.

35:43.341 --> 35:46.379
Come Monday morning,
only one national news magazine...

35:46.544 --> 35:50.117
...will have the biggest story
in the country on the cover.

35:51.616 --> 35:52.822
Now, listen up.

35:52.984 --> 35:56.431
Let's make sure everything
inside this cover is our very best.

35:56.587 --> 35:59.500
All right, get back to work.
Only six hours to close.

36:00.558 --> 36:02.231
That looked gratifying.

36:02.393 --> 36:05.340
- Yeah, it was.
- Guess we got a new cover.

36:05.496 --> 36:07.271
And we haven't loused it up yet.

36:07.431 --> 36:10.435
- Jesus, you must be hard to live with.
- Oh, you have no idea.

36:10.601 --> 36:12.877
Get down there,
tell JP we're punting on Namath.

36:13.037 --> 36:16.849
Don't use the football metaphor.
He's a little sensitive, that one.

36:17.008 --> 36:18.282
I think that I can save it.

36:18.442 --> 36:20.422
We got dead weight in Business
we can trim.

36:20.578 --> 36:23.422
You wanna save it, put Namath inside,
I'm not gonna stop you.

36:23.581 --> 36:25.424
But you're passing up an opportunity...

36:25.583 --> 36:27.756
...to show them something
important down there.

36:27.919 --> 36:31.196
Enlighten me, oh, wise one.

36:35.860 --> 36:39.467
You can share pizza, have a laugh,
be one of the fellas...

36:39.797 --> 36:42.801
...but at the end of the day,
each of those guys needs to know...

36:42.967 --> 36:46.574
...you hold the power
to crush their dreams.

36:50.374 --> 36:51.751
Sick man.

37:01.819 --> 37:02.854
Patti Robinson.

37:03.020 --> 37:04.590
- It's me.
- Can you believe that?

37:04.755 --> 37:06.996
Nixon's making the National Guard
deliver mail.

37:07.158 --> 37:10.139
It is a zoo here, Doug.
They're gonna run a new cover.

37:10.294 --> 37:13.173
<i>Congratulations, cover boy.
- Yes.</i>

37:13.331 --> 37:15.208
Do you think the union will give in now?

37:15.366 --> 37:18.313
<i>No. They think this looks worse for Nixon
than it does for them.</i>

37:18.469 --> 37:20.471
He's declared a state
of national emergency.

37:20.638 --> 37:22.447
Are you serious? For a postal strike?

37:22.607 --> 37:24.450
<i>Do you have new copy?</i>

37:24.775 --> 37:28.052
No, no, no. I'm calling to tell you
I'm gonna have a new lead graph...

37:28.212 --> 37:32.319
...to fold in Vinnie's reaction to Nixon,
and five new subs for the third column.

37:32.483 --> 37:33.655
Okay. You coming back?

37:33.818 --> 37:37.630
No. I wanna get more reactions and see if
they're gonna make an official response.

37:37.788 --> 37:39.392
Okay. Go write. Call me back.

37:39.557 --> 37:40.968
<i>Okay. Hey, Patti?</i>

37:41.125 --> 37:42.627
Yeah.

37:43.761 --> 37:45.468
This is a blast.

37:45.963 --> 37:47.909
The best.

37:56.707 --> 37:58.345
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

38:12.156 --> 38:14.727
- I got them.
- Wait, you got who?

38:14.892 --> 38:17.736
Denise, and maybe her two friends.

38:18.129 --> 38:19.733
- That's amazing.
- I know.

38:19.897 --> 38:23.037
- How?
- Eleanor. She is our secret weapon.

38:23.200 --> 38:24.235
Ah...!

38:24.402 --> 38:26.973
She brought up the thing
about the men's salaries again.

38:27.138 --> 38:28.583
- Damn it.
- I know.

38:28.739 --> 38:29.843
- Hey, folks.
- Hey.

38:30.007 --> 38:31.042
.L-ley-
.l-ley-

38:31.208 --> 38:32.710
- It's cold out there.
- Hey.

38:32.877 --> 38:34.379
That's all?

38:36.614 --> 38:38.218
They said it was raining.

38:42.520 --> 38:43.521
- Hey.
- Hi.

38:43.688 --> 38:45.565
I'm gonna go home.
You wanna share a cab?

38:45.723 --> 38:47.794
No, I--

38:50.795 --> 38:52.206
Uh, no, I--

38:52.363 --> 38:56.641
I think that I'm gonna hang out here
for a little while...

38:57.001 --> 38:59.572
...and see if he stops by.

39:03.774 --> 39:05.447
You know what you're doing, right?

39:07.178 --> 39:09.624
But you're gonna do it anyway?

39:23.294 --> 39:25.035
Robinson.

39:25.429 --> 39:27.466
Come on in. I'll give you a lift.

39:37.241 --> 39:39.380
One of the great mysteries
of Manhattan.

39:39.543 --> 39:42.183
The minute it starts raining,
all the taxicabs disappear.

39:42.346 --> 39:44.451
Thank you.
You can just drop me at the subway.

39:44.615 --> 39:46.652
- Where do you live?
- The subway is fine.

39:46.817 --> 39:49.263
- Nonsense. Where do you live?
- Perry and West Fourth.

39:49.420 --> 39:52.958
Raymond, we're stopping at Perry
and West Fourth first. Thank you.

39:56.827 --> 39:58.238
That was a day.

39:58.729 --> 40:02.006
That was a day. I love days like this.

40:02.166 --> 40:04.476
You must have had a lot of them.

40:05.102 --> 40:07.207
- I've had a few.
- Heh.

40:07.505 --> 40:08.779
But that's the beauty...

40:09.907 --> 40:12.387
...and the torture of the news.

40:12.676 --> 40:15.156
You never know when
you're gonna get another one.

40:15.379 --> 40:16.449
Could be tomorrow.

40:17.815 --> 40:19.852
Could be years.

40:24.622 --> 40:25.657
This is nice.

40:26.857 --> 40:28.734
The music.

40:29.193 --> 40:30.672
I don't get jazz.

40:30.828 --> 40:34.435
- You don't get-J'? You don't get jazz?
- No.

40:35.966 --> 40:39.277
I don't really think it's a question
of getting it or not, I-- I--

40:39.437 --> 40:43.852
It's more a question of how it feels
when it washes over you.

40:44.308 --> 40:49.451
I'm just looking for a lyric or a melody
or something to hold on to.

40:49.613 --> 40:52.253
Yeah, no. No holding on.

40:53.050 --> 40:55.860
Look, this music's not trying
to take you someplace, it's...

40:59.089 --> 41:01.194
It's trying to find you.

41:01.592 --> 41:04.539
