WEBVTT

00:01.869 --> 00:03.102
(music playing faintly)

00:03.104 --> 00:05.637
Guys, we made it.

00:05.639 --> 00:08.040
We're finally invited to
a party with the cool kids.

00:08.042 --> 00:09.775
That's right, boys.

00:09.777 --> 00:11.944
Once again,
we're being socially rewarded

00:11.946 --> 00:13.712
thanks to my...

00:13.714 --> 00:16.382
(imitates Kermit the Frog)
Kermit<i> the</i> Frog voice.

00:16.384 --> 00:18.517
Wocka, wocka, wocka.
We're at the door.

00:18.519 --> 00:20.552
Seriously, guys.
Shut the (bleep) up.

00:20.554 --> 00:22.154
(doorbell rings)

00:22.156 --> 00:24.623
Oh, this is great.
You guys came!

00:24.625 --> 00:27.126
Of course.
One needn't always watch

00:27.128 --> 00:29.461
"C.S.I. Cyber"
the night that it airs.

00:29.463 --> 00:32.264
(laughs)
Turn your invitations over.

00:35.369 --> 00:39.004
Oh, no, the back!
Why didn't we read the back?

00:39.006 --> 00:40.739
Do we have to stay
for this?

00:40.741 --> 00:43.208
What's the etiquette here?

00:43.210 --> 00:45.844
(cheering)

00:45.846 --> 00:47.813
BOY: Yeah!

00:47.815 --> 00:49.048
(gasps)

00:49.050 --> 00:50.315
(shrieks)

00:50.317 --> 00:51.417
(grunts)

00:53.921 --> 00:55.220
SNOT: Steve!

00:55.222 --> 00:56.989
Go on without me!

00:56.991 --> 01:00.092
No! Never leave
a friend behind.

01:00.094 --> 01:02.895
(cheering continues)

01:02.897 --> 01:06.498
(speaking Japanese)

01:09.203 --> 01:11.103
(chirping)

01:11.105 --> 01:13.405
BOTH: Aww!
Aww!

01:13.407 --> 01:14.740
(splat)

01:14.742 --> 01:16.075
MERTZ: Ha ha!

01:16.077 --> 01:18.577
(patriotic music plays)

01:18.579 --> 01:21.847
¶ Good morning, U.S.A. ¶

01:21.849 --> 01:25.217
¶ I got a feelin' that
it's gonna be a wonderful day ¶

01:25.219 --> 01:28.520
¶ The sun in the sky
has a smile on his face ¶

01:28.522 --> 01:32.591
¶ And he's shinin' a salute
to the American race ¶

01:34.428 --> 01:37.763
¶ Oh, boy, it's swell to say ¶

01:37.765 --> 01:40.065
¶ Good -- ¶
¶ Good morning, U.S.A. ¶

01:40.067 --> 01:41.366
Aah!

01:42.603 --> 01:46.038
¶<i> Good morning, U.S.A.</i> ¶

01:49.643 --> 01:51.443
SNOT: Oh, man.

01:51.445 --> 01:54.746
Looks like the party really
took off after we left.

01:54.748 --> 01:56.315
Should we have stayed?

01:56.317 --> 01:58.484
I just wanted to go to
one awesome party.

01:58.486 --> 02:00.486
Throw your own party.

02:00.488 --> 02:01.987
E-Excuse me?

02:01.989 --> 02:04.256
You're sick of not having
parties to go to?

02:04.258 --> 02:05.924
Throw your own.

02:05.926 --> 02:09.328
Sounds to me like you boys
deserve your moment

02:09.330 --> 02:12.564
of being cool.

02:13.601 --> 02:15.300
That was weird.

02:15.302 --> 02:17.603
Gentlemen,
that man at Bobby Freeze

02:17.605 --> 02:18.904
was onto something.

02:18.906 --> 02:20.772
And when a weird man
approaches you,

02:20.774 --> 02:23.342
a young boy in public,
you do what he tells you.

02:23.344 --> 02:24.910
We're having a party.

02:24.912 --> 02:26.745
Where?
Right here.

02:26.747 --> 02:29.114
My parents are on vacation
in Sarajevo.

02:29.116 --> 02:30.582
Every four years,

02:30.584 --> 02:32.518
they like to tour
a former Olympic site

02:32.520 --> 02:34.253
so they can imagine
what the games were like

02:34.255 --> 02:36.455
and reflect on
how the Olympians' best days

02:36.457 --> 02:37.923
are long behind them.

02:37.925 --> 02:39.691
SNOT:
Great idea for a vacation.

02:39.693 --> 02:41.360
BARRY: The Olympics
create more problems

02:41.362 --> 02:42.794
than they fix for a city.

02:42.796 --> 02:44.163
And every year,

02:44.165 --> 02:45.531
they leave me
a special allowance

02:45.533 --> 02:46.965
in case I decide
to have some fun

02:46.967 --> 02:47.966
while they're away.

02:47.968 --> 02:49.468
I've never touched it.

02:49.470 --> 02:52.171
So we can spend $400
on an awesome party.

02:52.173 --> 02:54.439
And the popular kids
won't be invited.

02:54.441 --> 02:57.509
It'll be for kids like us --
the dorks and nerds.

02:57.511 --> 02:59.878
And the kids who are both
stupid and unattractive.

02:59.880 --> 03:01.346
Aren't those dorks?

03:01.348 --> 03:03.649
No, dorks are often quite
good-looking.

03:03.651 --> 03:07.352
We'll invite Small Head David,
uh, Friendless Becky Fleming.

03:07.354 --> 03:09.221
Lolo Fuentes.

03:09.223 --> 03:13.492
Sexually Curious
Homeschooled Girl Lolo Fuentes?

03:13.494 --> 03:15.661
Her parents don't let her
leave the house.

03:15.663 --> 03:17.396
Maybe she'd sneak out
for this.

03:17.398 --> 03:19.965
'Cause this is gonna be
a party for all the kids

03:19.967 --> 03:21.700
who are never included.

03:21.702 --> 03:23.635
A party for the...

03:23.637 --> 03:24.870
SNOT AND STEVE:
Unincludeds!

03:24.872 --> 03:27.573
The deaf kids!

03:31.378 --> 03:34.813
(John Williams' "Olympic Fanfare
and Theme" playing)

03:34.815 --> 03:36.815
Francine, come and picture
what it was like

03:36.817 --> 03:39.351
to watch the opening ceremonies
from here.

03:39.353 --> 03:42.721
Ever done it in an abandoned
Eastern Bloc sports arena?

03:42.723 --> 03:45.257
Mmm, that depends.

03:45.259 --> 03:48.227
Is Romania
in the Eastern Bloc?

03:48.229 --> 03:50.562
And does it still count
if the stadium

03:50.564 --> 03:54.399
was full of
screaming spectators?

03:58.739 --> 04:01.740
What kind of food is
"nouveau Fretalian"?

04:01.742 --> 04:03.742
Stick with me.
I'm gonna nail my order.

04:03.744 --> 04:05.444
Hi. What can I get you?

04:05.446 --> 04:08.280
I guess I'll have
the beet salad,

04:08.282 --> 04:10.916
and, um, the risotto,
and a glass of red wine.

04:10.918 --> 04:12.417
Um, anything that's not
too expensive.

04:12.419 --> 04:13.585
Great order.

04:13.587 --> 04:16.188
(chuckling) Oh, please.

04:16.190 --> 04:18.423
I'll have the tuna tartare
with quail egg,

04:18.425 --> 04:21.526
the duck with pear mostarda,
and a glass of prosecco.

04:21.528 --> 04:23.362
I'll put that in
right away.

04:24.698 --> 04:27.799
How could she compliment
your order and not mine?

04:27.801 --> 04:29.234
Did she?
Please.

04:29.236 --> 04:31.737
She practically dry-humped
your turd of an order.

04:31.739 --> 04:33.205
Mine was inspired.

04:33.207 --> 04:34.806
She should've said
"great order" to me!

04:34.808 --> 04:36.575
Maybe she sensed that you were
gonna make me pay.

04:36.577 --> 04:37.976
Of course
you're paying for this.

04:37.978 --> 04:39.311
Who do you think was
paying for this?

04:39.313 --> 04:40.579
That<i> I'd</i> pay for this?

04:40.581 --> 04:42.147
After the way
<i> I've</i> been treated?!

04:42.149 --> 04:46.051
(Club music playing,
indistinct conversations)

04:49.323 --> 04:51.323
Whoa, it's packed!

04:51.325 --> 04:53.425
(doorbell rings)

04:53.427 --> 04:55.927
Yo, I heard you losers
are having a party.

04:55.929 --> 04:57.829
And I go to every party

04:57.831 --> 04:59.898
'cause I kinda have
a drinking problem.

04:59.900 --> 05:02.501
Welcome. If you would just
stand on that "X,"

05:02.503 --> 05:04.970
someone will be along
to take your coat.

05:04.972 --> 05:07.673
MERTZ:
Coat check! Nice touch.

05:08.809 --> 05:11.476
It's actually
a little chilly.

05:11.478 --> 05:13.011
I might hang on to my coat.

05:13.013 --> 05:15.514
Hey, Mertz!
How do you like your eggs?

05:15.516 --> 05:17.916
I like 'em hard-boiled
in the winter

05:17.918 --> 05:20.118
so I can put 'em
in my pockets

05:20.120 --> 05:22.954
and keep my hands warm
on my walk to --

05:22.956 --> 05:24.923
(grunting)

05:24.925 --> 05:26.658
Aah!

05:27.594 --> 05:31.229
Guys, we've become
what we despise.

05:32.199 --> 05:34.499
Yay!
All right!

05:34.501 --> 05:37.269
Our reign of cool
starts now.

05:37.271 --> 05:40.639
(electricity crackles)

05:40.641 --> 05:43.375
(door whooshes)

05:43.377 --> 05:45.344
Whoa.
Who are you?

05:45.346 --> 05:48.613
I'm you, Steve,
from the year 2040.

05:48.615 --> 05:51.650
And I'm you, Snot,
and we're here to warn you.

05:51.652 --> 05:53.752
You can't go back
to that party.

05:55.022 --> 05:56.722
If you're from the future,

05:56.724 --> 05:59.024
who wins the World Series
next year?

05:59.026 --> 06:00.525
Rene Russo.

06:00.527 --> 06:03.128
Buckle up,
it's a crazy season.

06:06.233 --> 06:07.833
(soft rock music playing)

06:07.835 --> 06:10.635
Future us?
We're so polished.

06:10.637 --> 06:13.572
Steve, look at us!
We're still hanging out.

06:13.574 --> 06:15.240
Yeah, we're best friends,

06:15.242 --> 06:17.576
like Taylor Swift
and Usain Bolt.

06:17.578 --> 06:19.511
Oh, you don't know
about that yet.

06:19.513 --> 06:20.812
They become best friends,

06:20.814 --> 06:22.381
briefly overthrow
the U.S. government,

06:22.383 --> 06:24.182
and are beheaded together
in Times Square.

06:24.184 --> 06:26.585
Steve, they don't want
a boring history lesson.

06:26.587 --> 06:28.186
What's important is

06:28.188 --> 06:31.189
we've been inseparable
for like 30 years.

06:31.191 --> 06:34.292
And together, we invented
the time machine.

06:35.429 --> 06:37.562
See, here's
the secret to life --

06:37.564 --> 06:39.598
if you're an awkward outsider
as a kid,

06:39.600 --> 06:42.868
you end up being a rich, cool,
and very successful adult.

06:42.870 --> 06:44.403
But a few days ago,

06:44.405 --> 06:46.104
we had a couple failures
in the lab,

06:46.106 --> 06:47.572
and that was weird.

06:47.574 --> 06:49.841
And when I got a memory
of getting a blow job

06:49.843 --> 06:52.577
in high school, we knew
something was very wrong.

06:52.579 --> 06:54.246
(sarcastically)
Oh, no, that's so bad.

06:54.248 --> 06:56.515
We checked the security
footage from our lab

06:56.517 --> 06:59.684
and noticed that Mertz stole
one of our time machines.

06:59.686 --> 07:02.621
I bet Mertz was that janitor
in Bobby Freeze!

07:02.623 --> 07:04.523
He -- He told us
to have a party.

07:04.525 --> 07:07.359
Oh! He wants you
to be cool now

07:07.361 --> 07:09.628
so in the future,
you aren't as successful.

07:09.630 --> 07:12.431
You guys<i> can't</i> go back down
to that party.

07:12.433 --> 07:14.032
What?

07:14.034 --> 07:16.401
You're asking us to give up
our chance to be popular

07:16.403 --> 07:18.904
and talk to all the girls
who are here to see us?

07:18.906 --> 07:21.072
It better be worth it
for us later on.

07:21.074 --> 07:22.707
Oh, it is.

07:22.709 --> 07:25.610
I've had sex four times
with three different women.

07:25.612 --> 07:29.581
You hear that, Snot?
Someone came back for seconds.

07:29.583 --> 07:31.583
Snot?

07:31.585 --> 07:35.787
He went down to the party!
He's gonna ruin everything!

07:35.789 --> 07:38.657
Okay, go get him,
but don't talk to anyone.

07:38.659 --> 07:40.425
Don't do anything memorable.

07:40.427 --> 07:43.428
Just make your usual
zero impact on people.

07:43.430 --> 07:45.063
Your future depends on it.

07:46.233 --> 07:48.166
What happens to me
and Toshi?

07:48.168 --> 07:50.669
Toshi stopped talking to us
after high school.

07:50.671 --> 07:53.104
(speaks Japanese)

07:53.106 --> 07:55.140
And, Barry, old friend,

07:55.142 --> 07:57.476
you died young in
a Formula One accident.

07:57.478 --> 08:00.278
Did a wheel hop the grandstand
and take my head off

08:00.280 --> 08:02.981
because I was looking
the other way because of nachos?

08:02.983 --> 08:06.451
No, you were
a super-famous driver.

08:06.453 --> 08:08.286
Oh.
In fact,

08:08.288 --> 08:10.589
during your
final Grand Prix,

08:10.591 --> 08:12.591
you got blinded
by the amount of tits

08:12.593 --> 08:14.192
being flashed in your face.

08:14.194 --> 08:16.194
But you kept your foot
on the gas, Barry.

08:16.196 --> 08:17.762
That was your way.

08:17.764 --> 08:20.532
No one had ever seen
a blind guy drive so straight.

08:20.534 --> 08:23.101
If only it had been
a straight course.

08:25.606 --> 08:27.639
I don't wanna do this.

08:27.641 --> 08:29.541
Since when did that ever
affect what we do?

08:29.543 --> 08:31.009
So, you know the plan?
Yeah.

08:31.011 --> 08:32.611
We reverse our orders
from the last time

08:32.613 --> 08:34.145
to see if she compliments
your order.

08:34.147 --> 08:36.481
And if she doesn't,
we'll know it's personal.

08:36.483 --> 08:38.450
And if it's personal,
you wanna guess

08:38.452 --> 08:40.385
which direction
the shit's going, Hayley?

08:40.387 --> 08:43.555
"A," down. "B," up.
"C," none of the above!

08:43.557 --> 08:44.890
Take the test, Hayley!

08:44.892 --> 08:46.358
"A!"
Which one was "A"?

08:46.360 --> 08:47.826
Down.
That's right!

08:47.828 --> 08:50.562
Good evening.
Oh!<i> Buenos noches.</i>

08:50.564 --> 08:52.163
I think we're ready.

08:52.165 --> 08:54.199
I'll have the beet salad,
risotto,

08:54.201 --> 08:56.201
and a glass of red wine.
And for you?

08:56.203 --> 08:58.904
I'll have the quail egg,
tuna tartare,

08:58.906 --> 09:01.873
the duck with pear mostarda,

09:01.875 --> 09:04.142
and a glass of, uh,
prosecco.

09:04.144 --> 09:05.377
Ooh, great order.

09:05.379 --> 09:06.978
No, no, absolutely no!

09:06.980 --> 09:08.747
Why did you tell her
she had a great order,

09:08.749 --> 09:11.016
but not me?
Did I? I'm sorry.

09:11.018 --> 09:13.118
I have a date tonight.
I wasn't even thinking.

09:14.388 --> 09:17.055
You heard her.
It's personal.

09:17.057 --> 09:19.057
That's not what she --
It's personal!

09:19.059 --> 09:21.560
(music playing faintly)

09:21.562 --> 09:24.696
(indistinct conversations)

09:24.698 --> 09:27.232
Oh...zero impact.

09:27.234 --> 09:29.768
Don't even make a ripple.

09:29.770 --> 09:31.570
(indistinct conversations)

09:31.572 --> 09:33.605
Klaus,
have you seen Snot?

09:33.607 --> 09:35.407
Why would I be
looking for Snot?

09:35.409 --> 09:37.275
This dude's hitting on me!

09:37.277 --> 09:40.045
BOY: It's Steve!
BOY: Steve, come hang out!

09:40.047 --> 09:41.446
Don't even make eye contact.

09:41.448 --> 09:42.781
(doorbell rings)

09:44.017 --> 09:48.119
¶¶

09:48.121 --> 09:50.088
Lolo Fuentes.

09:50.090 --> 09:51.957
Lolo Fuentes.

09:51.959 --> 09:53.425
It's Lolo Fuentes.

09:53.427 --> 09:55.026
That's Lolo Fuentes.

09:55.028 --> 09:57.062
Lolo Fuentes is here.

09:57.064 --> 09:59.464
Lolo Fuentes.

10:08.809 --> 10:10.408
Steve Smith?

10:10.410 --> 10:12.043
Um...

10:12.045 --> 10:13.478
I'm Lolo Fuentes.

10:13.480 --> 10:15.213
I've been homeschooled
my entire life,

10:15.215 --> 10:17.582
and I've never socialized
with peers before tonight.

10:17.584 --> 10:18.883
Thank you for including me.

10:18.885 --> 10:22.821
<i> Uhh...</i>

10:22.823 --> 10:24.222
I've never talked to
a boy before,

10:24.224 --> 10:26.291
but even I can tell
you're being smooth.

10:26.293 --> 10:27.993
(chuckles) And I can't lie.

10:27.995 --> 10:29.961
I'm -- I'm feeling some
new feelings.

10:29.963 --> 10:32.397
May -- May I hug you?

10:32.399 --> 10:33.999
Zero impact.

10:34.001 --> 10:35.900
You know just what to say.

10:35.902 --> 10:37.068
Mm...

10:37.070 --> 10:39.404
SIA: ¶ I'm ¶
BOTH: Mm!

10:39.406 --> 10:42.007
¶ Gonna swing ¶
BOY: Whoa!

10:42.009 --> 10:44.075
¶ From the chandelier ¶
BOY: Check out Steve-o!

10:44.077 --> 10:45.443
GIRL: Steve's the man!
(both moaning)

10:45.445 --> 10:47.012
BOY: Nice work, camera guy.

10:47.014 --> 10:48.680
Thanks, man.

10:48.682 --> 10:50.682
No one's more unincluded
thank the camera guy.

10:50.684 --> 10:55.587
¶ Gonna live like
tomorrow doesn't exist ¶

10:55.589 --> 10:58.323
¶ Like it doesn't exist ¶
(moaning continues)

10:58.325 --> 11:01.026
Steve, when you grow up
and your life's awesome,

11:01.028 --> 11:03.662
you're gonna look back
on this moment, bro.

11:03.664 --> 11:06.998
This is the moment
that changed everything.

11:07.000 --> 11:10.101
¶ Feel my tears as they dry ¶

11:10.103 --> 11:12.937
¶ I'm...¶
SNOT: Steve!

11:12.939 --> 11:14.706
Hey, where am I?

11:14.708 --> 11:17.142
A second ago I was blasting
my abs at the gym

11:17.144 --> 11:20.612
where I train for free
because I'm assistant manager.

11:20.614 --> 11:23.214
Whoa! I'm so ripped now.

11:23.216 --> 11:24.949
How many girls have you
had sex with?

11:24.951 --> 11:27.218
How many girls
haven't I had sex with?

11:27.220 --> 11:28.486
Zero.

11:28.488 --> 11:30.055
I'm awesome!

11:30.057 --> 11:32.323
I'm not awesome!
Look at me.

11:32.325 --> 11:34.693
Am I under a roof?

11:34.695 --> 11:36.561
Sheets!

11:38.498 --> 11:40.799
Steve, what did you do?

11:40.801 --> 11:42.867
I went downstairs
to look for you!

11:42.869 --> 11:46.504
I was in the bathroom.
I'd never go downstairs.

11:46.506 --> 11:48.873
I love my future self.

11:48.875 --> 11:50.975
The clean one.
Sorry, dude.

11:50.977 --> 11:54.145
Look, I'm the one who gave up.
It's my bad.

11:54.147 --> 11:57.549
I...I didn't do
anything cool, I swear.

11:57.551 --> 11:59.517
You must've done something
cool in the bathroom.

11:59.519 --> 12:00.752
I assure you,

12:00.754 --> 12:03.221
what I did in the bathroom
was not cool.

12:03.223 --> 12:05.090
Steve, come downstairs

12:05.092 --> 12:07.325
so we can keep making out
and breaking things.

12:07.327 --> 12:08.727
(gasps)

12:08.729 --> 12:10.428
Lolo, bunny,
give us a second.

12:11.598 --> 12:13.598
How could you do this
to us?!

12:13.600 --> 12:16.601
I couldn't help myself!
It's Lolo Fuentes!

12:16.603 --> 12:18.903
Look, all we have to do
is go back in time

12:18.905 --> 12:20.338
and undo what I just did.

12:20.340 --> 12:21.873
How are you gonna do that?

12:21.875 --> 12:23.541
With your
time machine.

12:23.543 --> 12:26.678
Whoa, oh, oh!
I have a time machine?

12:26.680 --> 12:27.979
It's gone!

12:29.549 --> 12:31.182
Whoa, oh, oh, oh!

12:31.184 --> 12:33.184
I<i> don't</i> have
a time machine.

12:33.186 --> 12:35.220
Time for a 1-minute plank.

12:35.222 --> 12:37.555
1 banana, 2 banana,

12:37.557 --> 12:39.090
3 banana...

12:42.262 --> 12:44.195
(indistinct conversations)

12:44.197 --> 12:46.564
Steve! You ruined
my future!

12:46.566 --> 12:48.566
N-Not necessarily.

12:48.568 --> 12:51.136
Maybe you're a bum
by choice, you know?

12:51.138 --> 12:52.771
Get out of the rat race.

12:52.773 --> 12:55.640
Oh, no, no, no.
I'm not doing a rat race again.

12:55.642 --> 12:58.777
They're fixed.
The rats know all the shortcuts.

12:58.779 --> 13:00.545
My rain boots.

13:00.547 --> 13:03.882
Look, Snot, our futures
clearly aren't set in stone.

13:03.884 --> 13:06.618
Let's just go downstairs
so you can do something cool.

13:06.620 --> 13:09.420
Then your future will be
awesome just like mine.

13:09.422 --> 13:11.623
I guess it's worth a shot.

13:11.625 --> 13:14.392
Barry, who's training you
these days?

13:18.632 --> 13:20.398
(music playing,
indistinct conversations)

13:20.400 --> 13:22.934
Steve's back!
Whoo, yeah!

13:22.936 --> 13:25.970
If I'm cool here,
you can be cool here, too.

13:25.972 --> 13:29.641
There's Becky
standing all alone.

13:29.643 --> 13:32.744
Go bring her a drink.
Okay.

13:34.314 --> 13:35.914
Hey, Becky.

13:35.916 --> 13:40.151
In this sea of losers,
you're the real standout.

13:40.153 --> 13:42.620
We may be unincluded,

13:42.622 --> 13:45.023
but I'm including<i> you</i>

13:45.025 --> 13:48.426
in my masturbation
fantasies later.

13:49.596 --> 13:51.796
Soda?!

13:51.798 --> 13:53.965
(all gasp)
My shirt is ruined!

13:53.967 --> 13:55.967
This is the first party
I've ever been to,

13:55.969 --> 13:58.102
and it's ruined!

13:58.104 --> 14:01.105
Wah!
(grunting loudly)

14:01.107 --> 14:02.807
(crying and grunting)

14:02.809 --> 14:04.342
Whoa.
Maybe there's a reason

14:04.344 --> 14:06.444
some of these people
don't get invited to stuff.

14:06.446 --> 14:09.614
I blew it. I'm never talking
to a girl again.

14:09.616 --> 14:11.516
No way. That took guts.

14:11.518 --> 14:14.552
Let's go upstairs and meet
the new and improved future you.

14:14.554 --> 14:16.454
Hey, Steve.

14:17.991 --> 14:22.827
(both moaning)

14:22.829 --> 14:24.462
Snot, I gotta tell you,

14:24.464 --> 14:26.764
she's a hell of a lot
better at this than you are.

14:28.568 --> 14:31.669
Hey!
Future me is even bigger.

14:31.671 --> 14:33.972
And he got a sweet new
deep v-neck hoodie.

14:33.974 --> 14:35.240
'Sup?

14:35.242 --> 14:36.841
Where's future me?

14:36.843 --> 14:38.877
Someone peed in there.

14:38.879 --> 14:41.179
How did I become a convict?

14:41.181 --> 14:44.816
Long time ago, I spilled a drink
on this girl, Becky,

14:44.818 --> 14:46.718
and she screamed at me.

14:46.720 --> 14:49.220
I vowed never to speak
to a woman again.

14:49.222 --> 14:50.855
And I never did --

14:50.857 --> 14:53.558
not even the ones I ate.

14:53.560 --> 14:55.026
Steve!

14:55.028 --> 14:56.661
Don't even worry about it.

14:56.663 --> 14:58.863
Sounds like all you have to do
is talk to a girl

14:58.865 --> 15:01.733
in the near 20 years
and this guy? Poof, he's gone.

15:01.735 --> 15:04.035
You're right.
Let's do it now.
(girls giggling)

15:04.037 --> 15:06.604
Do I hear girls downstairs?

15:06.606 --> 15:10.541
And if so, does
your basement have, like,

15:10.543 --> 15:13.311
one of those drains
in the floor?

15:15.615 --> 15:18.116
(indistinct conversations)

15:18.118 --> 15:19.951
There's some girls.
Talk to 'em.

15:21.288 --> 15:22.553
Hi.

15:22.555 --> 15:23.888
We're smokers.

15:23.890 --> 15:25.757
If you wanna talk to us,
you gotta smoke.

15:25.759 --> 15:27.792
(inhales)

15:27.794 --> 15:30.929
(coughing loudly)

15:30.931 --> 15:33.531
Okay,
you talked to a girl.

15:33.533 --> 15:37.769
Oh, my God!
I had a tracheotomy!

15:37.771 --> 15:39.304
(hoarse voice) Actually,

15:39.306 --> 15:42.941
my master said
I needed a new sex hole.

15:44.811 --> 15:46.611
This is hopeless!

15:46.613 --> 15:49.647
No matter what we do,
future me is doomed.

15:49.649 --> 15:51.449
Wait a minute.

15:51.451 --> 15:53.418
We've been trying to make
you look cool,

15:53.420 --> 15:55.320
when everybody here
is a nerd.

15:55.322 --> 15:57.288
We need to play
to our audience.

15:57.290 --> 15:59.223
Have you been practicing
your magic?

15:59.225 --> 16:01.125
Magic doesn't exist.

16:01.127 --> 16:03.661
But illusions are real!

16:03.663 --> 16:05.229
If you'd given me a heads up,

16:05.231 --> 16:06.898
I'd be holding flowers
right now.

16:06.900 --> 16:10.101
¶¶

16:10.103 --> 16:12.337
My card's not in the deck.

16:12.339 --> 16:13.805
Oh, man, are you sure?

16:13.807 --> 16:15.473
I know what card I picked.

16:17.610 --> 16:20.144
Would you mind
cutting open that orange?

16:22.849 --> 16:24.115
(cheering)

16:24.117 --> 16:25.650
That's an amazing trick.
Let's go.

16:25.652 --> 16:27.318
Did that work?

16:27.320 --> 16:29.821
(shrieking)

16:29.823 --> 16:31.122
(both scream)

16:31.124 --> 16:32.657
(continues shrieking)

16:37.330 --> 16:40.531
Lady, you are about to
deeply regret

16:40.533 --> 16:42.867
not telling me
you liked my order.

16:42.869 --> 16:44.936
Sounds trivial
when I say it out loud,

16:44.938 --> 16:46.404
but I know in my heart,
it's not.

16:47.640 --> 16:49.307
Need a job now.

16:49.309 --> 16:51.976
This is
an outstanding résumé.

16:51.978 --> 16:53.478
You start Monday.

16:53.480 --> 16:55.513
No, I'm-a start right now.

16:55.515 --> 16:58.416
(groaning)
(thud)

17:00.320 --> 17:03.354
Why didn't I open with that?
I knew I was gonna do it.

17:03.356 --> 17:04.722
Good evening, may I --

17:04.724 --> 17:06.124
take your order?
(crashing)

17:06.126 --> 17:07.959
I'll have the ricotta
and egg raviolo

17:07.961 --> 17:09.360
and the filet of sole.

17:09.362 --> 17:11.062
That is a great order.

17:11.064 --> 17:13.364
A great order.
And you?

17:13.366 --> 17:15.900
Tough order to follow.
Bed shitting potential is high.

17:15.902 --> 17:17.235
I'll have the same.

17:21.374 --> 17:23.374
(indistinct conversations)

17:23.376 --> 17:25.710
What is happening?!

17:25.712 --> 17:27.311
How did I get this way?

17:27.313 --> 17:30.715
(shrieking)

17:30.717 --> 17:33.051
I can't even explain it
to us!

17:33.053 --> 17:34.986
Snot, relax.

17:34.988 --> 17:36.888
No matter what happens
to you in the future,

17:36.890 --> 17:38.389
at least
we'll always be friends.

17:38.391 --> 17:40.758
Yeah, right.
Friends with a half turtle

17:40.760 --> 17:42.560
when there's full turtles
to be friends with?

17:42.562 --> 17:46.064
Steve, we haven't been friends
in any of these futures.

17:46.066 --> 17:48.599
You're right.

17:48.601 --> 17:50.201
That's it!

17:50.203 --> 17:52.837
It's our friendship that
makes us so successful.

17:52.839 --> 17:55.540
What we've got to do is
guarantee that we'll be friends

17:55.542 --> 17:58.176
no matter what
the future holds.
How?

17:58.178 --> 18:00.611
We gotta be outcasts again,
both of us.

18:00.613 --> 18:03.514
Unincluded from even
the unincludeds.

18:03.516 --> 18:05.216
Sorry, ripped future me.

18:05.218 --> 18:07.118
Even though
you're super awesome,

18:07.120 --> 18:09.587
I gotta do this
for my best friend.

18:10.957 --> 18:14.058
I guess I'm saying
goodbye to these.

18:14.060 --> 18:15.693
No matter what your future,

18:15.695 --> 18:18.963
you can still commit yourself
to regular exercise --

18:18.965 --> 18:20.465
I said goodbye.

18:20.467 --> 18:21.933
I'm scared.

18:21.935 --> 18:23.367
Don't be scared
of them.

18:23.369 --> 18:24.969
Be scared of<i> them.</i>

18:26.639 --> 18:28.639
Let's do this.

18:28.641 --> 18:30.274
WHAM: ¶ Jitterbug ¶

18:30.276 --> 18:32.276
¶¶

18:32.278 --> 18:34.278
¶ Jitterbug ¶

18:34.280 --> 18:35.980
(all gasp)
¶ Jitterbug ¶

18:35.982 --> 18:38.416
Guys, you've been having
a good night.

18:38.418 --> 18:40.885
Not sure this is a smart move
for you, bros.

18:40.887 --> 18:42.987
¶ You put the boom boom
into my heart ¶

18:42.989 --> 18:45.323
¶ You send my soul sky high
when your lovin' starts ¶

18:45.325 --> 18:47.492
It's working!
Let's take it home.

18:47.494 --> 18:49.293
¶ Jitterbug into my brain ¶
¶ Yeah, yeah ¶

18:49.295 --> 18:52.130
¶ Goes a bang-bang-bang
till my feet do the same ¶

18:52.132 --> 18:55.433
¶ But something's bugging me,
something ain't right ¶

18:55.435 --> 18:58.336
¶ My best friend told me
what you did last night ¶

18:58.338 --> 19:00.071
This is horrible.

19:00.073 --> 19:02.440
Hold on.
This has potential.

19:02.442 --> 19:05.176
¶ But I should've been
with you instead ¶

19:05.178 --> 19:07.812
¶ Wake me up
before you go-go ¶

19:07.814 --> 19:10.648
¶ Don't leave me hanging on
like a yo-yo ¶

19:10.650 --> 19:13.484
¶ Wake me up before you go-go ¶

19:13.486 --> 19:15.586
Yeah, okay. Yeah.

19:15.588 --> 19:17.155
Yeah, it's awesome!

19:17.157 --> 19:19.123
Sorry I doubted you, bros!

19:19.125 --> 19:20.992
Oh, no.

19:20.994 --> 19:22.693
¶ ...on going solo ¶

19:22.695 --> 19:25.296
Hey, who wants to Eiffel Tower
this turtle with me?

19:25.298 --> 19:26.531
What do we do?

19:26.533 --> 19:28.866
We gotta take it
to the next level.

19:28.868 --> 19:29.967
Look here.

19:29.969 --> 19:34.472
BOTH: 1...2...3...

19:34.474 --> 19:36.374
¶ Hey, where'd you get
that body from? ¶

19:36.376 --> 19:38.709
¶ Where'd you get
that body from? ¶

19:39.546 --> 19:43.648
¶ I got it from my daddy,
I got it from my daddy ¶

19:43.650 --> 19:45.449
¶ I got it, got it ¶
¶ Hey ¶

19:45.451 --> 19:47.818
¶ Where'd you get
that body from? ¶

19:47.820 --> 19:50.855
¶ I got it from my daddy,
I got it from my daddy ¶

19:50.857 --> 19:52.790
¶ I got it, got it ¶
¶ Hey ¶

19:52.792 --> 19:55.159
¶ Where'd you get
that body from? ¶

19:55.161 --> 19:57.328
¶ I got it from my dad, dad,
dad-dad, dad ¶

19:57.330 --> 19:59.497
¶ Dad, dad, dad-dad, dad ¶

19:59.499 --> 20:01.299
¶ Dad, dad, dad-dad, dad ¶

20:01.301 --> 20:02.967
¶ Daddy, I got it from my ¶

20:02.969 --> 20:04.902
¶ Dad, dad, dad-dad, dad ¶

20:04.904 --> 20:06.504
¶ Dad, dad, dad-dad, dad ¶
This is weird.

20:06.506 --> 20:08.072
I'm going home to spend
the rest of high school

20:08.074 --> 20:10.708
with my father.

20:10.710 --> 20:12.677
¶ I'm on fire ¶
Started out really good,
but it sucks now.

20:12.679 --> 20:14.245
¶ Take you higher ¶
Those two are such losers.

20:14.247 --> 20:16.380
(indistinct grumbling)

20:20.687 --> 20:22.687
Start the car!

20:22.689 --> 20:24.355
Drive, drive!
(tires screech)

20:24.357 --> 20:26.424
Roger,
what happened in there?
We did it!

20:26.426 --> 20:29.360
Same as him?
Same as him, my ass!

20:29.362 --> 20:30.828
That's a bitch move!

20:30.830 --> 20:32.663
You knew exactly the game
we were playing!

20:32.665 --> 20:36.033
(sobbing)

20:36.035 --> 20:40.671
(electricity hums,
glass shatters)

20:43.443 --> 20:45.676
Thank God we're back.

20:45.678 --> 20:47.878
And everything's the same.

20:47.880 --> 20:50.715
(electricity hums)

20:50.717 --> 20:52.783
Did one of you guys
just break a beaker?

20:52.785 --> 20:54.619
Why?
Does it change the future?

20:54.621 --> 20:56.520
No, but be careful!

20:56.522 --> 20:59.690
(electricity hums)

20:59.692 --> 21:02.193
Stop yelling at the kids!

21:02.195 --> 21:04.161
Bye! Have a beautiful time!
