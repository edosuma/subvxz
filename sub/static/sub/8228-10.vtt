00:06.941 --> 00:08.774
           All: WHOA!

00:08.776 --> 00:11.543
  Narrator: ...AND WILD EPISODE
       OF "MYTHBUSTERS"...

00:11.545 --> 00:15.214
   OOH, I DEFINITELY FEEL LIKE
I'M NOT REALLY IN CONTROL! WHOO!

00:15.216 --> 00:16.949
 HERE'S A LITTLE MATH FOR YOU --

00:16.951 --> 00:19.351
         FLAT TIRES PLUS
   POLICE CHASING YOUR BUTT...

00:19.353 --> 00:22.087
        WHOO-HOO-HOO-HOO!
      -OH, HE IS LOSING IT.

00:22.089 --> 00:24.023
            ...EQUALS
    "SEE YOU IN JAIL, BUDDY."

00:24.025 --> 00:26.025
   ACCORDING TO THE MURMURINGS
   OF THE CRIMINAL UNDERWORLD,

00:26.027 --> 00:28.127
  YOU CAN DEFEAT A SPIKE STRIP.

00:28.129 --> 00:30.095
      SO WE'RE GOING TO TRY
     A COUPLE OF DIY METHODS

00:30.097 --> 00:31.697
 FOR TOUGHENING UP OUR TIRES...

00:31.699 --> 00:34.600
                 THAT'S NOT
             A SEXY RIDE AT ALL!

00:34.602 --> 00:36.635
          ...AS WELL AS
 AN OUTRAGEOUS DRIVING MANEUVER

00:36.637 --> 00:39.571
     RIGHT OUT OF A HYPED-UP
        HOLLYWOOD HEIST.

00:39.573 --> 00:42.174
 Narrator: ...AND BRIAN AND JON
      MEET UP WITH A COUPLE

00:42.176 --> 00:46.478
  OF OLD PALS FROM "THE SEARCH"
  TO POWER UP A SUPER FOUNTAIN.

00:46.480 --> 00:49.014
   WE'RE TESTING THE MYTH THAT
 AN OLD MAN IN AN INNER TUBE...

00:49.016 --> 00:51.550
   YEAH, I THINK HE HAD A LITTLE
BIT TOO MUCH TO DRINK THIS TIME.

00:51.552 --> 00:53.352
     ...ACCIDENTALLY FLOATS
     HIS WAY OVER A FOUNTAIN

00:53.354 --> 00:56.922
 AND GETS SHOT UP INTO THE AIR,
  BEING SUSPENDED BY THE WATER.

00:56.924 --> 00:59.591
            COME ON!
            COME ON!

00:59.593 --> 01:01.860
        COME ON! COME ON!

01:01.862 --> 01:03.362

01:26.921 --> 01:29.721
  Narrator: THE FIRST MYTH OFF
THE BLOCKS INVOLVES AN ENTICING,

01:29.723 --> 01:35.160
YET HIGHLY DANGEROUS COCKTAIL --
       ALCOHOL AND WATER.

01:35.162 --> 01:38.230
       THE STORY GOES THAT
 A TIPSY SENIOR CITIZEN DECIDED

01:38.232 --> 01:40.132
          TO FINISH OFF
     AN EVENING OF DRINKING

01:40.134 --> 01:44.570
          WITH A DIP IN
  HIS HOTEL'S DORMANT FOUNTAIN.

01:44.572 --> 01:46.405
 FLOATING IN AN INFLATABLE RING,

01:46.407 --> 01:50.175
  HE BOBBED ACROSS THE WATER'S
   SURFACE IN A GENTLE STUPOR,

01:50.177 --> 01:54.113
         UNTIL, THAT IS,
  THE FOUNTAIN SPRANG TO LIFE,

01:54.115 --> 01:57.015
     SUSPENDING THE STARTLED
     SENIOR HIGH IN THE AIR

01:57.017 --> 01:59.218
      FOR SEVERAL SECONDS.

01:59.220 --> 02:00.819
    BUT WHEN THE MYTHBUSTERS
           INVESTIGATE

02:00.821 --> 02:03.288
      THIS TRUNK  MISADVENTURE,

02:03.290 --> 02:08.426
   WILL IT HOLD WATER OR IS IT
 MERELY HYDRODYNAMIC HYPERBOLE?

02:11.499 --> 02:13.565
          WELL, THIS SOUNDS LIKE
    A SENIOR'S PARTY GONE WRONG.

02:13.567 --> 02:15.901
YEAH, I'D SAY GONE WRONG
   AND THEN SOME.

02:15.903 --> 02:17.136
             IT'S SAFE TO ASSUME
      THAT THOSE GREAT FOUNTAINS

02:17.138 --> 02:19.338
       IN VEGAS AND DUBAI AREN'T
        GOING TO LET US DO THIS.

02:19.340 --> 02:21.173
YOU MEAN BECAUSE IT'S NOT GOOD
FOR THEIR PUBLIC IMAGE?

02:21.175 --> 02:22.474
               YEAH, EXACTLY.

02:22.476 --> 02:24.776
           BUT THAT MEANS WE GET
      TO BUILD A SUPER FOUNTAIN,

02:24.778 --> 02:26.245
               AND I'VE NEVER
              DONE THAT BEFORE.

02:26.247 --> 02:28.647
OH, WAIT. HERE'S THE SURPRISE --
  I HAVEN'T EITHER.

02:28.649 --> 02:30.682
                LET'S DO IT.

02:30.684 --> 02:33.819
     BUT BEFORE THE GUYS GO
     FULL VEGAS AND ENGINEER

02:33.821 --> 02:35.287
        A SUPER FOUNTAIN,

02:35.289 --> 02:37.789
       THEY NEED TO LEARN
   HOW TO OPTIMIZE ITS DESIGN

02:37.791 --> 02:40.592
        TO LIFT AND HOLD
       A FLOATING OBJECT.

02:40.594 --> 02:43.562
     LUCKILY FOR US, WE HAVE
  A CUSTOM-BUILT "MYTHBUSTERS"

02:43.564 --> 02:46.865
      FOUNTAIN RIGHT HERE,
   INCLUDING A POWERFUL PUMP,

02:46.867 --> 02:48.300
     A FLOW REGULATOR VALVE,

02:48.302 --> 02:51.303
  A RESERVOIR WITH ENOUGH WATER
      FOR CONTINUOUS FLOW,

02:51.305 --> 02:54.306
         AND A SERIES OF
     INTERCHANGEABLE NOZZLES

02:54.308 --> 02:56.175
     THAT WILL HELP US FIND
       THE OPTIMUM STREAM

02:56.177 --> 02:58.243
        TO GIVE THIS MYTH
        THE BEST CHANCE.

02:58.245 --> 03:01.747
            Both: OH!

03:01.749 --> 03:03.549
THAT'S MORE REASONABLE.

03:03.551 --> 03:04.850
             Brian:
   THIS MYTH IS ABOUT A PERSON

03:04.852 --> 03:06.585
         BEING LEVITATED
      BY A STREAM OF WATER,

03:06.587 --> 03:08.453
          BUT A PERSON
        IS ODDLY SHAPED.

03:08.455 --> 03:10.122
        OOH!

03:10.124 --> 03:11.456
      WE'RE GOING TO START
         WITH SOMETHING

03:11.458 --> 03:14.693
      WITH A LITTLE SIMPLER
 PHYSICAL PROPERTY -- A SPHERE.

03:14.695 --> 03:16.628
           ALL RIGHT.
          -LET'S DO IT.

03:16.630 --> 03:19.331
  Narrator: THE FIRST NOZZLE UP
   FOR TESTING IS MEDIUM-SIZED

03:19.333 --> 03:22.901
   AND PRODUCES WHAT IS KNOWN
     AS A CLEAR STREAM JET.

03:22.903 --> 03:28.640
 SO IS IT CAPABLE OF SUSPENDING
     A FOAM BALL IN MIDAIR?

03:28.642 --> 03:29.908
            Both: OH!

03:29.910 --> 03:31.109
    -IT LOOKED SO PROMISING.
         -YOU KNOW WHAT?

03:31.111 --> 03:32.678
              I STARTED TO SEE
             SOMETHING, THOUGH.

03:32.680 --> 03:35.314
  SHE'S GOING TO FALL OUT TO ONE
SIDE, BUT WATCH AS IT COMES OUT,

03:35.316 --> 03:39.651
              IT STARTS TO SPIN
         AND SLOW DOWN ITS FALL.

03:39.653 --> 03:40.953
                     AH!
             YOU SEE IT HANG UP?

03:40.955 --> 03:44.856
IT ROLLS OFF THE STREAM.

03:44.858 --> 03:46.692
               I THINK WE NEED
           A LITTLE MORE STREAM.

03:46.694 --> 03:48.193
    LET'S DO IT.

03:48.195 --> 03:49.728
        WHOO!

03:49.730 --> 03:52.631
                     OH!
      OH!

03:52.633 --> 03:53.899
        THAT BALL IS LEVITATING.

03:53.901 --> 03:55.834
             -WHOA.
       -THAT'S GREAT, MAN.

03:55.836 --> 03:59.838
                 HOLY MOLY!
  IT'S KIND OF LIKE BLACK MAGIC.

03:59.840 --> 04:03.976
   BUT THE HIGH-SPEED FOOTAGE
  REVEALS THIS IS NO WITCHERY.

04:03.978 --> 04:06.245
       IT'S PURE PHYSICS.

04:06.247 --> 04:07.713
               THE BALL IS NOT
                 IN THE JET.

04:07.715 --> 04:10.482
            IT'S OFF TO THE SIDE
   AND IT'S CONSTANTLY SPINNING.

04:10.484 --> 04:12.184
       RIGHT?
THAT'S THAT HYDRODYNAMIC EFFECT.

04:12.186 --> 04:13.819
OBVIOUSLY GRAVITY IS
PULLING THE BALL DOWN,

04:13.821 --> 04:15.687
  BUT THE WATER IS
PUSHING IT UP AND OUT,

04:15.689 --> 04:18.357
BUT THE IMPORTANT FORCE,
THAT WATER BEING FLUNG AROUND,

04:18.358 --> 04:20.425
PUSHING IT BACK INTO THE STREAM
 AND STABILIZING IT.

04:20.427 --> 04:23.795
    IT'S A SPECTACULAR TRICK
         THE GUYS REPEAT

04:23.797 --> 04:26.965
   WITH A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT
       BALLS AND NOZZLES.

04:26.967 --> 04:29.201
      BUT THE HYDRODYNAMIC
       EFFECT MOST LIKELY

04:29.203 --> 04:31.903
   DOESN'T EXPLAIN THIS MYTH.

04:31.905 --> 04:33.639
                THAT'S COOL,
             BUT CHECK THIS OUT.

04:33.641 --> 04:38.343
       BUSTER IN HIS INNER TUBE,
           NO MAGIC CARPET RIDE.

04:38.345 --> 04:42.547
SO IT'S BACK TO TESTING AND TIME
     FOR A SWITCH OF BALLS.

04:42.549 --> 04:45.884
WE HAVE THIS ONE. YEAH.
IT'S HEAVIER THAN THIS ONE.

04:45.886 --> 04:47.419
 IT'S SMALLER, TOO.
WANT TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS?

04:47.421 --> 04:49.655
                      YEAH.
   HERE WE GO!

04:49.657 --> 04:51.823
        OKAY.

04:51.825 --> 04:52.991
         OH!

04:55.329 --> 04:57.229
          OH! SO CLOSE!
              -OH!

04:59.099 --> 05:00.799
         OH!

05:00.801 --> 05:02.100
I SHOULDN'T HAVE YELLED.

05:02.102 --> 05:04.536
              I WAS SO EXCITED
      FOR LIKE 1/10 OF A SECOND.

05:04.538 --> 05:06.605
 THE JET IS JUST TOO TURBULENT,

05:06.607 --> 05:08.440
    AND BECAUSE SOME SECTIONS
       OF THE WATER COLUMN

05:08.442 --> 05:11.810
 ARE MOVING FASTER THAN OTHERS,
    THE INTERNAL DIFFERENCES

05:11.812 --> 05:15.881
    IN PRESSURE THIS CREATES
 THROWS THE BALL OUT EVERY TIME.

05:15.883 --> 05:18.050
        I THINK A SMALLER NOZZLE
              IS GOING TO PULL

05:18.052 --> 05:21.053
             A LITTLE TRICK HERE
                THAT WE NEED.

05:21.055 --> 05:23.722
        BRIAN IS BACKING
   A SMALL CLEAR STREAM NOZZLE

05:23.724 --> 05:25.757
 TO PRODUCE A LESS TURBULENT JET

05:25.759 --> 05:29.394
 IN WHICH THE WATER IS MOVING AT
 A MORE UNIFORM SPEED WITH LESS

05:29.396 --> 05:32.798
     DESTABILIZING VARIANCE
     AND INTERNAL PRESSURE.

05:32.800 --> 05:36.702
              GIVE HER A SHOT.

05:36.704 --> 05:39.971
    OH, COME ON!

05:39.973 --> 05:41.173
             OOH, LOOK AT THAT!

05:41.175 --> 05:43.408
              THAT'S BEAUTIFUL,
          AND I THINK THAT MEANS

05:43.410 --> 05:46.311
              THESE NOZZLES ARE
                 IMPORTANT.

05:46.313 --> 05:49.614
 IN FACT, SEVERAL NOZZLE TYPES,
  WHICH PRODUCE A MORE STABLE,

05:49.616 --> 05:51.083
       LESS TURBULENT JET,

05:51.085 --> 05:54.686
      ALSO STEADILY SUSPEND
     WEIGHTIER RUBBER BALLS.

05:54.688 --> 05:57.255
             THERE YOU HAVE IT.

05:57.257 --> 05:59.991
     THIS IS A DIFFERENT PHYSICS
PRINCIPAL THAN WE SAW LAST TIME.

05:59.993 --> 06:03.929
        YEAH.

06:03.931 --> 06:06.465
      AND A COMPARISON WITH
     THE HYDRODYNAMIC EFFECT

06:06.467 --> 06:08.800
        REVEALS WHY THESE
        DIFFERING PHYSICS

06:08.802 --> 06:11.536
        COULD BE CRUCIAL
      TO SOLVING THIS MYTH.

06:11.538 --> 06:12.904
       Brian:
THAT'S THE HYDRODYNAMIC EFFECT

06:12.906 --> 06:14.506
     AND THAT'S
  BERNOULLI EFFECT.

06:14.508 --> 06:16.475
      MM. IT ALMOST DOESN'T LOOK
        LIKE THE BALL IS MOVING.

06:16.477 --> 06:20.245
       IT'S JUST WATER MOVING UP
               AND AROUND IT.

06:20.247 --> 06:22.414
      THE BERNOULLI EFFECT,
     IT'S LIKE CUPPED HANDS.

06:22.416 --> 06:25.016
     THE TOP OF THAT STREAM
  HOLDS THE BALL IN THE CENTER,

06:25.018 --> 06:26.985
       AND IF IT'S PUSHED
        OFF TO THE SIDE,

06:26.987 --> 06:29.121
  THERE'S ACTUALLY EXTRA FORCE
       FROM THAT MOVEMENT

06:29.123 --> 06:31.923
AND LESS FORCE ON THE OTHER SIDE
BECAUSE THE BALL HAS MOVED OVER,

06:31.925 --> 06:34.259
 MAKING THAT BALL WANT TO SHIFT
      BACK INTO THE CENTER,

06:34.261 --> 06:35.594
       HOLDING IT STEADY,

06:35.596 --> 06:37.362
    AND THAT BERNOULLI FORCE
           IS EXACTLY

06:37.364 --> 06:40.599
         WHAT WE WANT TO
       TAKE ADVANTAGE OF.

06:40.601 --> 06:45.904
Narrator: BUT BEFORE MINI BUSTER
 GETS TO RIDE IN THE JET FLOW...

06:45.906 --> 06:48.707
   LET'S SWERVE OVER TO A MYTH
    ABOUT FLEEING THE FIVE-O.

06:48.709 --> 06:50.542

06:58.218 --> 07:00.318
      AND THE BEST EFFORTS
      OF THE BOYS IN BLUE.

07:00.320 --> 07:04.890
         THEIR SECRET --
      DIY TOUGHENED TIRES.

07:04.892 --> 07:06.858
    BUT WHEN THE MYTHBUSTERS
          INVESTIGATE,

07:06.860 --> 07:11.763
   WILL THESE CRIMINAL CLAIMS
   HOLD FIRM OR HIT THE SKIDS?

07:14.701 --> 07:17.702
   THIS IS JON LUNG REPORTING
  LIVE FOR "MYTHBUSTERS NEWS,"

07:17.704 --> 07:19.538
      AT WHAT APPEARS TO BE
       A HORRIFIC ACCIDENT

07:19.540 --> 07:21.840
     INVOLVING AN OVERTURNED
         TANKER TRAILER

07:21.842 --> 07:25.377
         JUST A 1/4 MILE
     OUTSIDE OF HAZMAT CITY!

07:25.379 --> 07:27.112
   ACTUALLY, THIS IS JON LUNG

   "MYTHBUSTERS" AT DEL VALLE
   DISASTER TRAINING FACILITY

    WHERE FIREFIGHTERS TRAIN
     EVERY DAY FOR REAL LIFE

07:32.719 --> 07:35.587
  DISASTERS JUST LIKE THIS, AND
  IT'S THE PERFECT PLACE FOR US

07:35.589 --> 07:36.922
         TO HAVE OUR OWN
         LITTLE DISASTER

07:36.924 --> 07:39.591
  INVOLVING SOME SPIKE STRIPS.

07:39.593 --> 07:41.526
        -THE BEST STUFF.
          -[ WHISTLES ]

07:41.528 --> 07:44.529
  -THIS IS A REAL SPIKE STRIP.
              -WOW.

07:44.531 --> 07:46.398
               THAT'S NOTHING
             BUT BUSINESS, HUH?

07:46.400 --> 07:47.699
    LOOK AT THIS.
THE SPIKES COME RIGHT OUT,

07:47.701 --> 07:49.634
 AND THEY'RE HOLLOW
TO BLEED THE AIR OUT.

07:49.636 --> 07:51.603
  THESE LITTLE FEET
 ACTUALLY GET CAUGHT

15:31.464 --> 15:33.131
FEELS LIKE IT'S GOING
TO TAKE THE WEIGHT. YOU READY?

15:33.133 --> 15:35.900
             -YEAH.
      -I'M GOING TO LET GO!

15:35.902 --> 15:38.369
                  OH, SNAP!

15:38.371 --> 15:39.837
        THAT'S SOMETHING
          RIGHT THERE.

15:39.839 --> 15:42.173
  I THINK THIS ACTUALLY APPLIES
    TO THIS MYTH REALLY WELL

15:42.175 --> 15:44.676
         BECAUSE IF MINI
        BUSTER WAS DRUNK,

15:44.678 --> 15:46.177
     HE WOULDN'T HE HANGING
      ON TO THAT, WOULD HE?

15:46.179 --> 15:48.346
I MEAN, HE LITERALLY
JUST FELL OFF OF IT.

15:48.348 --> 15:51.482
I DON'T THINK A SINGLE NOZZLE
 IS GOING TO CUT IT.

15:51.484 --> 15:53.084
                THINK THERE'S
        A FAIR AMOUNT OF PHYSICS

15:53.086 --> 15:55.019
          AND ENGINEERING THAT'S
        GOING TO HAVE TO BE DONE

15:55.021 --> 15:58.356
             TO MAKE THIS WORK,
             BUT I HAVE AN IDEA.

15:58.358 --> 16:01.626
            Narrator:
  THE MYTHBUSTERS ARE GOING TO
REBUILD THE SMALL-SCALE FOUNTAIN

16:01.628 --> 16:04.495
      WITH AN ARRAY OF JETS
    ENCIRCLING A CENTRAL JET,

16:04.497 --> 16:07.098
  TO BETTER REPLICATE THE VEGAS
      FOUNTAIN IN THE MYTH.

16:07.100 --> 16:09.033
        WHEW!

16:09.035 --> 16:13.471
     AND THAT PROCESS STARTS
     WITH A COMPLEX DESIGN.

16:13.473 --> 16:16.407
  YOU KNOW, USUALLY SOME IDEAS
      LOOK EASIER ON PAPER.

16:16.409 --> 16:18.643
    THIS IS NOT ONE OF THEM.

16:18.645 --> 16:20.178
      LET'S GO
  BUILD THIS THING.

16:20.180 --> 16:21.245
          -LET'S DO IT.
           -ALL RIGHT.

16:27.520 --> 16:29.053

16:30.357 --> 16:36.527

16:38.698 --> 16:39.897
                 ALL RIGHT.
              THIS LOOKS GOOD.

16:39.899 --> 16:41.432
             LET'S SHUT IT DOWN,
             TIGHTEN THOSE DOWN,

16:41.434 --> 16:43.968
        AND TRY TO FLOAT BUSTER.

16:45.071 --> 16:49.907
  COMING UP, THE GUYS GET SOME
  EXPERT HELP FROM OLD PALS...

16:49.909 --> 16:52.076
I JUST LIKE HUGGING IT.

16:52.078 --> 16:54.645

   THEIR SMALL-SCALE FOUNTAIN

16:54.647 --> 16:56.447

            ...AND...

16:59.285 --> 17:01.085
     Jon: OKAY, HERE WE GO.

17:01.087 --> 17:04.422
Narrator: ...IT'S CONCRETE TIRES
       VERSUS SPIKE STRIP,

17:04.424 --> 17:06.257
          BUT WILL THIS
       HEAVYWEIGHT DUEL...

17:06.259 --> 17:08.259
    Jon: SPIKE STRIPS ENGAGE!

17:08.261 --> 17:11.229
 Narrator: ...END IN A KNOCKOUT
          OR A BLOWOUT?

17:11.231 --> 17:13.431
          Jon: OH, YES!

17:17.369 --> 17:19.470
E MYTHBUSTERS ARE
 Narrator: ...END IN A KNOCKOUT
    INVESTIGATING A TALL TALE

17:19.472 --> 17:23.941
     OF DRUNKEN MISADVENTURE
       IN A WATER FEATURE.

17:23.943 --> 17:25.510
     THE FIRST TIME WE TRIED
     TO LEVITATE MINI BUSTER

17:25.512 --> 17:27.744
       IN HIS INNER TUBE,
     WE HAD A SINGLE NOZZLE

17:27.747 --> 17:29.580
     WHICH RESULTED IN SOME
       KIND OF INTERESTING

17:29.582 --> 17:32.150
     LEAN ON THE INNER TUBE
       WHERE HE FELL OUT.

17:32.152 --> 17:34.619
         BUT NOW WE HAVE
   AN ENTIRE ARRAY OF NOZZLES,

17:34.621 --> 17:37.922
   WHICH I THINK WILL GIVE US
   A PRETTY STABLE LEVITATION

17:37.924 --> 17:41.092
            OF BUSTER
    AND HIS MINI INNER TUBE.

17:41.094 --> 17:44.095
       LET'S SAY WE START
  WITH THE OUTSIDE RING FIRST.

17:44.097 --> 17:48.332
                   Brian:
             SOUNDS GOOD TO ME.

17:48.334 --> 17:49.901
         OH!

17:49.903 --> 17:51.836
THAT IS PRETTY COOL.

17:51.838 --> 17:55.106
      IT SEEMED TO BE RIDING THE
  OUTSIDE AND IT FELL RIGHT DOWN

17:55.108 --> 17:57.909
       WHERE THAT CENTRAL NOZZLE
        ISN'T FLOWING RIGHT NOW.

17:57.911 --> 17:59.944
   SO WHAT I THINK
    YOU'RE SAYING

17:59.946 --> 18:02.280
IS WE SHOULD TRY THIS
WITH THE INNER NOZZLE.

18:02.282 --> 18:03.481
                   I THINK
        IT WOULD BE A GOOD IDEA.

18:03.483 --> 18:05.683
           -ALL RIGHT.
           -ALL RIGHT.

18:05.685 --> 18:08.352
  Narrator: FIRST, THEY'LL TRY
 THE CENTER JET A LITTLE HIGHER

18:08.354 --> 18:11.189
      THAN THE OUTER ARRAY.

18:11.191 --> 18:13.424
       IT'S STRAIGHT OVER
      THE FALLS FOR BUSTER,

18:13.426 --> 18:17.095
 BUT THE GUYS ARE GOING TO GIVE
 THE INSIDE JET ANOTHER CHANCE.

18:17.097 --> 18:18.830
   DOWN A SMIDGEN
   ON THE INSIDE?

18:18.832 --> 18:21.833
   YEAH, YOU THINK WE CAN GET TO
   ABOUT 6 INCHES OR SO BELOW...

18:21.835 --> 18:24.569
YEAH. I CAN GET ANYTHING
   YOU WANT, JON.

18:28.208 --> 18:30.341
THAT'S GETTING CLOSE, MAN.

18:30.343 --> 18:34.045
   CLOSE, BUT NO HYDRAULICALLY
        SUSPENDED CIGAR.

18:34.047 --> 18:38.616
  MINI BUSTER'S JET RIDE LASTS
     FOR LESS THAN A SECOND.

18:38.618 --> 18:40.218
             THINK WE'D BENEFIT
               FROM A SLIGHTLY

18:40.220 --> 18:41.752
           MORE REALISTIC-WEIGHT
                 MINI BUSTER

18:41.754 --> 18:43.387
                   BECAUSE
             HE'S PRETTY LIGHT.

18:43.389 --> 18:45.356
THEN WE PUT A FEW NUTS IN THERE,
                TAPE HIM DOWN

18:45.358 --> 18:46.791
           LIKE HE'S HANGING ON,

18:46.793 --> 18:50.128
JUST SO WE CAN FIND THAT BALANCE
       POINT IN OUR SMALL-SCALE.

18:50.130 --> 18:52.163
 BY MAKING MINI BUSTER HEAVIER,

18:52.165 --> 18:54.599
     THE RATIO OF HIS WEIGHT
      TO HIS RING'S WEIGHT

18:54.601 --> 18:56.734
  WILL BE CLOSER TO TRUE SCALE.

18:56.736 --> 18:59.070
       IT WILL ALSO LOWER
     HIS CENTER OF GRAVITY,

18:59.072 --> 19:02.173
     WHICH JON THINKS SHOULD
 STABILIZE HIS RIDE IN THE JETS.

19:02.175 --> 19:03.207
                    OKAY.

19:03.209 --> 19:05.409
    TO BALANCE THE INCREASED
        DOWNWARDS FORCE,

19:05.411 --> 19:08.346
       A BEEFED-UP BUSTER
        WILL NOW EXERT...

19:08.348 --> 19:09.780
              UP A LITTLE BIT.
             OH, IT'S TOO HIGH.

19:09.782 --> 19:12.550
      ...THE GUYS CRANK UP
   THE OUTER ARRAY TO 10 FEET

19:12.552 --> 19:15.019
  AND DROP THE INNER JET TO 5.

19:15.021 --> 19:16.220
            -HOW FAR?
          -THAT'S GOOD.

19:16.222 --> 19:17.688
     ALL RIGHT.

19:17.690 --> 19:19.657
          SO WILL THIS
      WATERY CONFIGURATION

19:19.659 --> 19:22.293
      RESULT IN LEVITATION?

19:22.295 --> 19:24.795
BUSTER, INTO A 10-FOOT TALL
     OUTER ARRAY

19:24.797 --> 19:28.166
WITH HALF-HEIGHT INNER ARRAY
 IN THREE, TWO, ONE!

19:31.037 --> 19:33.671
                     OH!

19:33.673 --> 19:35.039
                 [ LAUGHS ]

19:35.041 --> 19:37.542
                     OH!

19:37.544 --> 19:39.644
               OH!
     -WHAT DO YOU CALL THAT?

19:39.646 --> 19:41.112
     LEVITATION!

19:41.114 --> 19:44.582
     IT'S A PRETTY TURBULENT
  JET RIDE FOR THE LITTLE GUY,

19:44.584 --> 19:47.385
  BUT HE CLINGS ON TO HIS RING
        FOR THE DURATION.

19:47.387 --> 19:50.655
AND CLOCKING A TOTAL FLIGHT TIME
          OF 7 SECONDS,

19:50.657 --> 19:52.957
 THIS SMALL-SCALE TEST SUGGESTS

19:52.959 --> 19:55.426
        THERE MAY YET BE
     SOME TRUTH TO THE MYTH.

19:55.428 --> 19:57.161
           -HOLY MOLY!
             -RIGHT?

19:57.163 --> 19:59.530
SO I THINK THERE'S ONLY
  ONE QUESTION NOW.

19:59.532 --> 20:01.933
   YOU THINK THAT FOUNTAIN STILL
WORKS WHEN IT'S UNDER THE WATER?

20:01.935 --> 20:04.435
YEAH. HOW DID BUSTER FLOAT
   ON TOP OF THAT?

20:06.539 --> 20:09.674
    WE JUST SAW A PRETTY GOOD
  LEVITATION OF OUR MINI BUSTER

20:09.676 --> 20:11.409
     IN HIS MINI INNER TUBE.

20:11.411 --> 20:14.212
     BUT THE MYTH DOES STATE
 THAT OUR OLD GEEZER DOES FLOAT

20:14.214 --> 20:16.480
        ACCIDENTALLY INTO
    A BUNCH OF FOUNTAINHEADS

20:16.482 --> 20:18.216
  AND THEN GETS LIFTED UPWARDS.

20:18.218 --> 20:20.685
 SO OUR NEXT STEP IS TO DROP OUR
          NOZZLE ARRAY

20:20.687 --> 20:24.989
  DOWN UNDER THE WATER AND SEE
 IF WE CAN GET THE SAME RESULT.

20:24.991 --> 20:26.457
          BUSTER IS IN POSITION.

20:26.459 --> 20:29.894
            GO AHEAD AND FIRE IT
             IN THREE, TWO, ONE!

20:31.998 --> 20:33.531
                 [ LAUGHS ]

20:33.533 --> 20:36.934
THAT LOOKS DIFFERENT.

20:36.936 --> 20:39.537
MORE LIKE A WAVE POOL
THAN A BEAUTIFUL FOUNTAIN.

20:39.539 --> 20:42.306
 THE STUFF IS RAINING BACK DOWN,
              IT'S RIPPLING OUT

20:42.308 --> 20:44.308
               AND THE RIPPLES
             ARE COMING BACK IN,

20:44.310 --> 20:46.244
            AND SO WE'RE GETTING
              INTERMITTENT FLOW

20:46.246 --> 20:47.545
               WHEN THE NOZZLE
               IS ABOVE WATER

20:47.547 --> 20:48.779
           -YOU READY?
           -YEAH. NOW!

20:48.781 --> 20:50.815
  -PRETTY! NOPE! PRETTY! NOPE!
         -NOW! NOW! NOW!

20:50.817 --> 20:52.350
    PRETTY! OKAY.

20:52.352 --> 20:55.586
    SO, PROBLEM?

20:55.588 --> 20:59.290
      I THINK WE SHOULD TRY THIS
              IN A BIGGER POOL

20:59.292 --> 21:00.791
               SO THAT THERE'S
                 LESS SPLASH

21:00.793 --> 21:03.027
             AND THEN WE CAN TRY
        WITH FULL-SIZED NOZZLES?

21:03.029 --> 21:04.295
TEXAS-SIZED FOUNTAIN?

21:04.297 --> 21:05.396
                I LIKE THAT.

21:05.398 --> 21:06.564
                WELL, IF IT'S
         A TEXAS-SIZED FOUNTAIN,

21:06.566 --> 21:08.399
          WE SHOULD PROBABLY GET
             A TEXAS-SIZED CREW.

21:08.401 --> 21:10.201
        OOH.
  TAMARA AND ALLEN?

21:10.203 --> 21:11.469
                   I LIKE
             THE WAY YOU THINK.

GO GIVE THEM A CALL!

21:12.939 --> 21:16.974
  STILL TO COME...BRIAN AND JON
  HIT THE ROAD WITH OLD FRIENDS

21:16.976 --> 21:18.843
   TO FIND A FULL-SIZE POOL...

21:18.845 --> 21:20.811
      HA! AAH!

21:20.813 --> 21:25.683
  ...AND GIVE THEIR SMALL-SCALE
 FOUNTAIN A TEXAS-SIZED UPGRADE.

21:25.685 --> 21:28.552
  AND JON IS IN FOR A WILD RIDE

21:28.554 --> 21:30.521
     AS HE ATTEMPTS TO BEAT
        A SPIKE STRIP...

21:30.523 --> 21:32.523

       OH, HE IS LOSING IT. YEP.

21:32.525 --> 21:34.425
  ...AND MAKE A CLEAN GETAWAY.

Jon: WHOO! SAVED THE CAMERA,
   YOU'RE WELCOME!

21:42.568 --> 21:45.936
E MYTHBUSTERS ARE ATTEMPTING
  TO FOIL A POLICE SPIKE STRIP

  AND MAKE A SUCCESSFUL GETAWAY
   USING DIY-TOUGHENED TIRES.

21:51.711 --> 21:56.213
   BUT THEIR FIRST EFFORT WITH
A/B FOAM-FILLED TIRES FELL FLAT.

21:56.215 --> 21:57.348
                    Jon:
           YOU HEAR THAT, BRIAN?

21:57.350 --> 21:58.949
          THAT'S THE SOUND OF US
              GOING TO PRISON.

    TO THE WEIGHT OF THE CAR.

       IS SLOW ON THE WAY

       ARE HANDLING WELL.

the end when I picked up speed,

23:02.148 --> 23:04.482
                OH, GOT THAT
             SPIKE STRIP AGAIN.

 A SEXY RIDE AT ALL.

23:13.793 --> 23:16.026
MAYBE IT'S GOING TO BE
    MY LAST LAP.

23:16.028 --> 23:17.361

23:17.363 --> 23:20.564
     HERE WE GO!
OH, WE'RE STILL GOOD, CAMERA!

23:20.566 --> 23:22.900
   AND HERE WE GO.

23:22.902 --> 23:24.635
        AAH!

23:29.876 --> 23:33.778
WELL, WHAT DO YOU SAY
ABOUT THAT, MR. NEW YORK DRIVER?

23:33.780 --> 23:37.348
               IF YOU'RE GOING
            AT 25 MILES AN HOUR,

23:37.350 --> 23:39.283
       YOU HAVE COMPLETE CONTROL
                 OF THE CAR.

23:39.285 --> 23:42.586
         YOU GO 35 MILES AN HOUR
       AND THEN THE ENTIRE THING

23:42.588 --> 23:45.689
          IS JUST YOU GOING LIKE
           THIS DOWN THE STREET.

23:45.691 --> 23:47.558
SO I'M NOT PERFECTLY
   EDUCATED ON IT,

23:47.560 --> 23:50.194
BUT WHAT'S THE TOP SPEED
  OF A POLICE CAR?

23:50.196 --> 23:52.196
               I'M PRETTY SURE
            SIGNIFICANTLY FASTER

23:52.198 --> 23:55.900
          THAN 35 MILES AN HOUR.

23:55.902 --> 23:57.768
           EVEN THOUGH
    THE CONCRETE-FILLED TIRES

23:57.770 --> 24:00.104
        NOT ONLY SURVIVED
         THE SPIKE STRIP

24:00.106 --> 24:02.406
  BUT ALMOST RIPPED IT IN HALF,

24:02.408 --> 24:04.975
       THEIR ADDED WEIGHT
      AND LACK OF TRACTION

24:04.977 --> 24:08.846
         ALSO DESTROYED
       THE CAR'S HANDLING.

24:08.848 --> 24:13.250

 END OF THE ROAD FOR THIS MYTH.

VERSUS SPIKE STRIPS.

24:15.321 --> 24:17.421
        WELL, THE CONCRETE TIRES
    ROLLED RIGHT OVER THE SPIKES

24:17.423 --> 24:19.190
               AND NEARLY CUT
              THE STRIP IN TWO.

24:19.192 --> 24:21.392

YOU GOT UP TO SOME SPEED?

24:21.394 --> 24:23.260

        AFTER THAT, NOT SO MUCH.

  A SECOND SPIKE-BUSTING MYTH.

      CAN A HOLLYWOOD SKID
         SKIP THE STRIP?

24:57.964 --> 25:02.199
  BUT NOW IT'S BACK TO THE MYTH
  OF THE GEEZER GEYSER AND HQ,

25:02.201 --> 25:05.035
    WHERE BRIAN AND JON HAVE
  ENLISTED THE HELP OF OLD PALS

       FROM "THE SEARCH,"
 TAMARA ROBERTSON AND ALLEN PAN.

25:09.008 --> 25:11.041

                 NEXT STEPS?

25:11.043 --> 25:12.376
                SO WE'VE DONE
              THE SMALL-SCALE.

25:12.378 --> 25:14.311
             WE TRIED ONE NOZZLE
        AND AN ARRAY OF NOZZLES.

25:14.313 --> 25:15.613
             BUT WHAT WE GOT TO
                WAS THE POINT

25:15.615 --> 25:17.448
            WHERE OUR SMALL POOL

  TO CRASH BACK OVER THE NOZZLE,
       INTERRUPTING THAT STREAM.

25:20.219 --> 25:21.685

         A BIGGER POOL.

25:21.687 --> 25:22.887
            LUCKILY WE HAVE ONE.

25:22.889 --> 25:24.622
YEAH, BUT BEFORE WE GET
TO THAT BIGGER POOL,

25:24.624 --> 25:27.258
        WE HAVE TO BUILD
          ALL OF THIS.

ENOUGH PRESSURE FOR THE OUTER

   THAT'S AWESOME.

29:51.123 --> 29:52.589
                LOOK AT THAT!

29:52.591 --> 29:54.391
  THE FOUNTAIN REMAINS INTACT,

29:54.393 --> 29:57.861
  AND EVEN WITH THE BIGGER PUMP
    BACKED OFF FULL CAPACITY,

29:57.863 --> 30:02.733
      THE OUTER JETS REACH
   AROUND 60 FEET IN THE AIR.

30:02.735 --> 30:06.370
DEFINITELY ENOUGH FORCE
TO PUSH AND HOLD BUSTER UP.

30:06.372 --> 30:07.638

              YEAH.

30:07.640 --> 30:09.506

 Narrator: THE MYTHBUSTERS HAVE
    PUT THEIR SUPER FOUNTAIN

30:28.928 --> 30:31.728
          TO THE TEST,
  AND THE RESPONSE WAS GUSHING.

30:31.730 --> 30:33.530
                     OH!

30:33.532 --> 30:36.200
    BUT ARE ITS POWERFUL JETS
      CAPABLE OF SUSPENDING

30:36.202 --> 30:39.636
        A DRUNKEN OLD GUY
      IN AN INFLATABLE RING

30:39.638 --> 30:41.505
     AS CLAIMED IN THE MYTH?

30:41.507 --> 30:43.674
     ACCORDING TO THIS MYTH,
    THIS GEEZER HAS TO FLOAT

30:43.676 --> 30:46.410
  EXACTLY ON TOP OF A FOUNTAIN
     RIGHT WHEN IT GOES OFF.

30:46.412 --> 30:48.178
   TO MAKE SURE THAT HAPPENS,
       ME, JON, AND TAMARA

30:48.180 --> 30:51.315
     ARE GOING TO BE GUIDING
   THE FLOAT WITH THESE LINES.

30:51.317 --> 30:53.784
    Narrator: BUT FOR INITIAL
TESTING THERE WILL BE NO BUSTER,

30:53.786 --> 30:56.620
    JUST HIS INFLATABLE RING,

30:56.622 --> 30:58.655
       AND THE MYTHBUSTERS
        WILL START SMALL,

30:58.657 --> 31:00.357
   FIRING ONLY THE OUTER JETS

31:00.359 --> 31:03.560
         POWERED BY ONE
       OF THE LARGE PUMPS.

31:03.562 --> 31:07.965
 IN THREE, TWO, ONE!

31:07.967 --> 31:12.736
ALL RIGHT, LET IT GO!
 GO, GO, GO, GO, GO!

31:12.738 --> 31:14.671
   COME ON, BABY!

31:14.673 --> 31:17.774
  BUT EVEN WITH THE LARGE PUMP
     AT CLOSE TO FULL POWER,

31:17.776 --> 31:22.145
   THE OUTER JETS FAIL TO LIFT
      THE INFLATABLE RING.

31:24.083 --> 31:25.949
           WHAT IF WE TRAPPED IT
        WITH THE OUTER LIKE THAT

31:25.951 --> 31:28.252
           AND THEN ACTUALLY USE
 THE CENTER TO START RAISING IT?

31:28.254 --> 31:30.053
   -SO USE BOTH SETS OF PUMPS?
              -YEP.

31:30.055 --> 31:32.522

POWER ON THE OUTER ARRAY, TOO,

31:32.524 --> 31:34.658
 TO LOCK IT WELL IN.

31:34.660 --> 31:35.792
                 COPY THAT.
         ALL RIGHT. LET'S DO IT.

31:37.663 --> 31:41.198
                 ALL RIGHT.
                 LET IT GO.

31:43.035 --> 31:46.870
                     OH!

31:46.872 --> 31:49.273
       THE INNER JETS DID
       PROVIDE EXTRA LIFT,

31:49.275 --> 31:51.375
      BUT NOT THE SUSTAINED
        STABLE SUSPENSION

31:51.377 --> 31:54.244
     DESCRIBED IN THE MYTH.

31:54.246 --> 31:56.113
         DO YOU THINK THE WEIGHT
           OF BUSTER WOULD HELP?

31:56.115 --> 31:57.981
 LET'S THROW BUSTER
      IN THERE.

31:57.983 --> 32:01.451
 IN EARLIER PHASES OF TESTING, A
   REALISTIC SCALE AND WEIGHT

32:01.453 --> 32:04.187
        MINI BUSTER WITH
    A LOWER CENTER OF GRAVITY

32:04.189 --> 32:06.890
          WAS CRITICAL
    TO SUCCESSFUL LEVITATION.

32:06.892 --> 32:09.693
  SO COULD THE ADDITION OF THIS
  GUY MAKE ALL THE DIFFERENCE?

32:09.695 --> 32:12.095
THIS GUY HAS GOT TO GET
THAT PARTYING UNDER CONTROL.

32:12.097 --> 32:14.631
   YEAH, I THINK HE HAD A LITTLE
BIT TOO MUCH TO DRINK THIS TIME.

32:14.633 --> 32:17.167
 AND WHAT BETTER WAY TO SOBER UP

32:17.169 --> 32:21.405
   THAN WITH A RELAXING FLOAT
      IN A SUPER FOUNTAIN?

32:21.407 --> 32:23.640
  AFTER A BUNCH OF PRELIMINARY
  TESTS TO HONE IN EVERYTHING,

32:23.642 --> 32:25.242
       I THINK WE'RE READY
        TO GO FULL-SCALE.

32:25.244 --> 32:26.777

    I THINK HE'S GOING TO GO
         PRETTY HIGH UP,

32:31.984 --> 32:33.684
        SINCE WE GOT THAT
   GOOD STABILIZING OUTER RING

 NO FOUNTAIN FLIGHT FOR BUSTER.

33:42.654 --> 33:45.455

33:45.457 --> 33:48.191
        EVERY TIME WE SEE
OLD MAN BUSTER ALMOST GET LIFTED

33:48.193 --> 33:50.861
      BY THE CENTER ARRAY,
    HE FLIPS FEET OVER HEAD.

33:50.863 --> 33:53.330
NOW, THAT'S BECAUSE HE'S HEAVIER
 IN THE CHEST THAN HIS LEGS ARE,

33:53.332 --> 33:56.033
       JUST LIKE A NORMAL
         HUMAN BEING IS.

 FOUNTAIN SUCCESSFULLY SUSPENDED

       CAREFULLY BALANCED

34:01.774 --> 34:03.940
     THE WEIGHT DISTRIBUTION
          IN HIS RING.

34:03.942 --> 34:06.843
   BUT AS AN OLD DUDE SITTING
      IN AN INFLATABLE RING

34:06.845 --> 34:09.146
      WOULD BE IMBALANCED,
        JUST LIKE BUSTER,

   DECIDE TO BOTH RECONFIGURE

34:17.790 --> 34:19.889
          THE FOUNTAIN
         AND HOOK IT UP

34:19.891 --> 34:22.626
