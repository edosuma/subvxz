WEBVTT

02:11.051 --> 02:12.821
(male narrator)
I guess down at Pensacola

02:12.887 --> 02:16.657
they still talk about the day
of the Admiral's tea party.

02:16.725 --> 02:18.927
It was one of what came
to be called

02:18.993 --> 02:21.930
"Spig's Big Days."

02:21.996 --> 02:24.365
Spig Wead and I
were in Annapolis

02:24.432 --> 02:27.501
and World War I together.

02:27.568 --> 02:30.271
But all along,
Spig knew he wanted to fly

02:30.338 --> 02:33.441
and I knew I wanted
whatever Spig wanted.

02:33.507 --> 02:35.676
So we wangled our way

02:35.744 --> 02:40.581
into the first regular
flying class the Navy ever had.

02:40.648 --> 02:43.417
Not bad, not bad, not bad.

02:43.484 --> 02:45.519
Question, Mr. Dexter.

02:45.586 --> 02:47.621
The same question,
Mr. Wead?

02:47.688 --> 02:51.225
- The same question, sir.
- Same answer, Mr. Wead.

02:51.292 --> 02:53.862
I suspected
as much, sir.

02:53.928 --> 02:56.030
What was the answer,
Mr. Wead?

02:56.097 --> 02:58.232
We are not to engage
in solo flight

02:58.299 --> 03:01.903
until our instructor feels
we are ready, sir.

03:01.970 --> 03:04.638
And the reason,
Mr. Wead?

03:04.705 --> 03:07.308
Planes and funerals
are expensive.

03:07.375 --> 03:10.544
They cost the taxpayers
money, sir.

03:10.611 --> 03:15.283
Attention. I shall see you
at the Admiral's tea party.

03:15.349 --> 03:16.317
Dismissed.

03:17.618 --> 03:19.353
Come on,
let's go.

03:19.420 --> 03:22.123
Spig, will you quit
riling him?

03:22.190 --> 03:24.092
Hey, Price.

03:25.927 --> 03:28.029
[band music]

03:35.336 --> 03:37.872
Hey, can these things
really fly?

03:37.939 --> 03:39.707
Where did you fellas
leave your motorcycles?

03:39.774 --> 03:41.843
Mac, there's no smoking
on the base.

03:41.910 --> 03:44.245
- What about you?
- Cigars only.

03:49.017 --> 03:52.286
How do you like that? What's
the Army doing around my plane?

03:52.353 --> 03:54.388
Who cares what
the Army's doing, Spig?

03:54.455 --> 03:57.859
Min told us 3 o'clock. She's
waiting. The Admiral's tea?

03:57.926 --> 04:00.128
Hey, you!

04:03.731 --> 04:05.466
You wanna buy her?

04:05.533 --> 04:08.536
This pile of junk? Can anybody
get it up in the air?

04:08.602 --> 04:11.572
Why don't you just
hop right up in there with me

04:11.639 --> 04:13.241
and we'll find out?

04:13.307 --> 04:15.543
Now, why don't we
just do that?

04:21.449 --> 04:23.451
Trip over your spurs?

04:24.986 --> 04:28.957
Put your foot here. One foot
there. Back over here now.

04:29.023 --> 04:31.459
- Spig, you idiot!
- 'Jughead, let's go.'

04:31.525 --> 04:34.128
- Go where?
- Taking the Army for a ride.

04:34.195 --> 04:35.997
You're taking the Army
for a ride?

04:36.064 --> 04:37.465
- Just like that?
- Just like that.

04:37.531 --> 04:39.700
You've never been at the
controls by yourself before.

04:39.767 --> 04:42.536
Right now, this minute, you owe
six payments on your furniture

04:42.603 --> 04:44.839
three on your Stutz Bearcat,
two on your baby.

04:44.906 --> 04:47.608
Know what happens if anything
goes wrong? A court-martial.

04:47.675 --> 04:50.444
They'll kick you out and I'll
wind up a second-class seaman

04:50.511 --> 04:52.914
the rest of my life,
like this dope here.

04:52.981 --> 04:55.249
- Think of the future, Mr--
- Shut up, Pincus.

04:55.316 --> 04:57.318
Spig Wead,
never listen to anybody else.

04:57.385 --> 04:59.954
Just do exactly what
you wanna do all the time.

05:00.021 --> 05:01.990
Alright, you wanna fly
that thing? Go ahead.

05:02.056 --> 05:04.292
Kill yourself. You'll wind up
busted and broke.

05:04.358 --> 05:07.028
I can always
join the Army.

05:07.095 --> 05:09.563
Why don't you be quiet
just once in a while?

05:09.630 --> 05:12.000
Mr. Wead wants to fly,
didn't you hear him?

05:12.066 --> 05:14.903
Get a line. Hurry up.
Get a move on.

05:17.138 --> 05:19.607
- Ready, Army?
- Ready, Navy.

05:21.009 --> 05:23.111
[whirring]

05:34.855 --> 05:37.325
Crazy idiot, Spig!
No, don't do it!

05:44.232 --> 05:45.900
(male #1)
'Spig, don't!'

06:05.486 --> 06:08.589
Alright, Johnny. Where is he?
I told him 3 o'clock.

06:08.656 --> 06:12.660
Did I have to specify what day?
Who's that idiot?

06:19.800 --> 06:21.335
That's Spig, honey.

06:22.503 --> 06:24.405
Spig?

06:29.477 --> 06:34.082
Hey! Hey, how much time
have you had?

06:34.148 --> 06:37.451
- About 11 seconds.
- What?

06:37.518 --> 06:39.453
Eleven seconds.

06:41.489 --> 06:43.357
The Admiral's tea party
was this afternoon.

06:43.424 --> 06:46.260
I couldn't help it.
I tried to tell him.

06:52.967 --> 06:55.103
(Johnny)
I did everything I--

07:00.208 --> 07:02.343
(Johnny)
I did everything I could!

07:12.320 --> 07:14.522
- Get that crash boat.
- Yes, sir.

07:14.588 --> 07:16.490
Let's go. Now.

07:23.364 --> 07:26.067
Come on. Let's go.
Let's go.

07:43.884 --> 07:45.853
Put it down, down, down.

07:45.919 --> 07:48.489
Hey, there's my crew.

07:49.823 --> 07:52.060
Let's buzz 'em.

07:54.095 --> 07:56.764
Oh, no!

08:01.469 --> 08:03.904
Come here!

08:03.971 --> 08:05.239
Look it there.

08:05.306 --> 08:07.541
Hey, lookie there.

08:09.743 --> 08:11.079
Hey yo!

08:11.145 --> 08:13.247
[train chugging]

08:19.653 --> 08:23.091
Hey, did you ever fly
through a hangar?

08:23.157 --> 08:25.793
No. Oh, no. Oh, come on,
fella. No, no!

08:25.859 --> 08:28.062
Neither have I.

08:50.784 --> 08:52.220
That's my wife.

08:53.687 --> 08:57.057
I'm sorry, ma'am.
I did everything I could.

08:59.293 --> 09:02.530
- Hey, let me have the stick.
- What?

09:04.832 --> 09:07.968
The stick.
I'm taking over.

09:08.035 --> 09:10.138
No!

09:23.584 --> 09:26.387
- What's the matter?
- We're out of gas.

09:26.454 --> 09:29.223
Well, set her down,
you idiot!

09:37.765 --> 09:40.534
Watch this landing.

09:40.601 --> 09:44.205
No, on the water!
On the water!

09:46.039 --> 09:47.775
Hang on.

09:58.252 --> 09:59.720
Spig!

10:11.632 --> 10:13.767
You alright, sir?

10:16.704 --> 10:19.440
Sorry, shorty,
I missed it.

10:20.941 --> 10:24.778
You alright, Spig? Give him
a hand. Get him out of here.

10:24.845 --> 10:26.614
Are you alright?

10:29.650 --> 10:31.552
Spig!

10:35.856 --> 10:37.591
Afraid? So am I.

10:37.658 --> 10:40.461
Pardon me, ma'am.
Please? Please.

10:44.898 --> 10:48.202
Wead...the Admiral
would like to see you

10:48.269 --> 10:51.038
in his quarters immediately.

10:51.104 --> 10:53.040
Yes, sir.

10:53.106 --> 10:55.576
Won't be home
for dinner, hon.

10:57.044 --> 11:00.248
Good! I hope they throw
the book at you, page by page!

11:00.314 --> 11:02.082
I hope they throw you--

11:02.149 --> 11:03.551
- Captain Hazard?
- Yes.

11:03.617 --> 11:05.553
General Ricketts'
compliments, sir.

11:05.619 --> 11:08.422
He would like
to see you at once.

11:18.999 --> 11:21.168
- 'That's all you got to say?'
- Yes, sir.

11:21.235 --> 11:23.170
- 'Nothing more to add?'
- No, sir.

11:23.237 --> 11:25.373
- 'Whole truth and nothing but?'
- Yes, sir.

11:25.439 --> 11:27.608
Carson...do you know

11:27.675 --> 11:30.911
that you're the biggest liar
in the United States Navy?

11:30.978 --> 11:33.113
Yes, uh, no, s..
Yes, sir.

11:33.180 --> 11:35.115
That's all.

11:35.182 --> 11:37.285
Thank you, sir.

11:43.056 --> 11:44.325
(male #2)
'Mr. Wead.'

11:44.392 --> 11:47.528
- Attention.
- Carry on, gentlemen. Carry on.

11:51.865 --> 11:53.601
Mr. Wead, from Annapolis

11:53.667 --> 11:55.603
with your commendation
for war duty

11:55.669 --> 11:57.838
this is a record
that any officer might envy.

11:57.905 --> 12:00.207
That is,
up until this episode.

12:00.274 --> 12:02.443
'You've confirmed the facts
presented to this board?'

12:02.510 --> 12:04.144
(Wead)
'Yes, sir.'

12:04.211 --> 12:07.180
Any statement you'd like to make
prior to the board's action?

12:07.247 --> 12:08.616
- 'Yes, sir.'
- Make it.

12:08.682 --> 12:10.851
Charges against me boil down
to doing something

12:10.918 --> 12:12.686
I'd never done before.

12:12.753 --> 12:16.089
How else will we get aviation
for the United States Navy?

12:16.156 --> 12:17.758
This all may be true

12:17.825 --> 12:20.794
but it doesn't seem to have
much bearing on this case.

12:20.861 --> 12:22.530
Sir, it is the case.

12:22.596 --> 12:24.532
At least, it's mine.

12:24.598 --> 12:26.700
And I think
it should be yours.

12:41.715 --> 12:43.317
- Hi, Min.
- Hi.

12:43.384 --> 12:44.885
Hi, Commodore.

12:44.952 --> 12:47.120
I borrowed a little
of ol' Spig's corn whiskey.

12:47.187 --> 12:50.358
Sure, that's okay. What else
have you got to do? Here.

12:51.659 --> 12:53.727
What are you
all clobbered up about, Min?

12:53.794 --> 12:55.963
If Spig gets bounced out
of the Navy--

12:56.029 --> 12:58.031
Spig bounced
out of the Navy!

12:59.500 --> 13:02.836
Look, Johnny,
Spig just joined the Navy.

13:02.903 --> 13:05.205
I'm married to it.

13:05.272 --> 13:08.108
I run the mess hall,
I swab the decks

13:08.175 --> 13:10.744
I chip the rust.

13:10.811 --> 13:14.181
You're afraid that they'll
kick Spig out of the Navy.

13:14.247 --> 13:17.084
I'm afraid
that they won't.

13:19.853 --> 13:21.755
[crying]

13:25.058 --> 13:26.494
Hey.

13:32.265 --> 13:34.602
I think
he's feverish.

14:07.200 --> 14:09.803
- Now, I owe you my life.
- You owe me nothing.

14:09.870 --> 14:11.972
That's what
I meant.

14:24.518 --> 14:25.986
[indistinct chatter]

14:28.656 --> 14:30.891
- Good evening.
- Good evening, Mrs. Wead.

14:30.958 --> 14:33.126
So they didn't
kick you out after all.

14:33.193 --> 14:34.562
Right.

14:34.628 --> 14:36.797
And you spent all
of next month's pay celebrating.

14:36.864 --> 14:40.668
Wrong. I won the first-to-solo
pool and I am loaded.

14:40.734 --> 14:42.803
- Hey--
- No cracks.

14:42.870 --> 14:45.372
The squadron decided
that flying with the Army

14:45.439 --> 14:49.276
was as close to solo
a sailor could get.

14:49.342 --> 14:52.345
And this,
my titian-haired darling

14:52.412 --> 14:54.314
is what I brought
for you.

14:54.381 --> 14:56.584
First prize.

14:56.650 --> 14:59.487
- Commodore's sick.
- Commodore?

15:02.456 --> 15:05.626
Where's the Commodore?
Hiya, little ol' fella.

15:05.693 --> 15:07.695
How do you feel,
little ol' boy?

15:07.761 --> 15:11.965
Look what your dad brought you.
First prize for the first crash.

15:13.734 --> 15:16.036
Hey, let's get out of there.

15:16.103 --> 15:18.271
You know, this crib's
getting a little small

15:18.338 --> 15:20.474
for the ol' Commodore.

15:23.544 --> 15:27.648
Hey, Min...
this kid is sick.

15:45.633 --> 15:49.169
- The doc's in there.
- He'll be okay, Spig.

15:49.236 --> 15:51.238
Sure, Mr. Wead.
Them little kids get everything.

15:51.304 --> 15:53.240
- You know, colds, measles.
- Yeah, sure.

15:53.306 --> 15:56.810
I had the mumps myself, six
times. It don't mean anything.

15:58.478 --> 16:00.581
(Min)
'Spig!'

16:02.382 --> 16:04.484
[Min sobbing]

16:11.491 --> 16:13.594
Sorry, Spig.

16:20.367 --> 16:22.803
- Anything we can do?
- No.

16:24.638 --> 16:27.340
But he can do her
some good.

16:27.407 --> 16:29.509
Stick around.

17:12.619 --> 17:14.722
[sobbing]

17:39.212 --> 17:42.015
- Congratulations.
- Thank you, sir.

17:46.119 --> 17:47.354
Congratulations.

18:03.737 --> 18:06.506
(Carson)
We sort of split up,
Spig and I did

18:06.573 --> 18:08.709
after graduation.

18:08.776 --> 18:11.311
He became a hotshot pilot,
alright.

18:11.378 --> 18:16.449
Hotshot with a plane
and...a baby carriage too.

18:16.516 --> 18:19.720
In those years,
Spig was only little brass.

18:19.787 --> 18:24.324
But after all,where would big
brass be without little brass?

18:24.391 --> 18:26.727
[door opens]

18:26.794 --> 18:29.830
- 'Good morning, sir.'
- Good morning, Jack.

18:29.897 --> 18:31.631
- Did you see this?
- Yes, sir.

18:31.699 --> 18:35.035
- What are we gonna do about it?
- Jack, who's our best pilot?

18:35.102 --> 18:38.205
I don't mean the best throttle
jockey or the one who flies

18:38.271 --> 18:41.809
by the pit of his stomach
or by the seat of his pants.

18:41.875 --> 18:44.244
I mean our best brain.

18:44.311 --> 18:47.214
Capital B-R-A-I-N.

18:47.280 --> 18:49.182
S-P-I-G.

18:50.784 --> 18:52.753
- Get him.
- Yes, sir.

18:54.454 --> 18:55.723
[music on gramophone]

18:55.789 --> 18:57.390
(girl #1)
'Give me my shovel.'

18:57.457 --> 18:59.359
Come on.
Give it to me.

18:59.426 --> 19:02.896
Quiet, kids. Go on upstairs
and take your bath.

19:02.963 --> 19:04.698
Just a minute,
young ladies.

19:04.765 --> 19:08.836
Come back here and pick those up
and take them upstairs with you.

19:08.902 --> 19:11.772
Come on. Now, hurry up.
Hurry up.

19:11.839 --> 19:15.308
Come on.
Go on, get moving.

19:15.375 --> 19:18.011
See that you wash
yourselves clean.

19:23.383 --> 19:24.384
[music stops]

19:28.756 --> 19:31.158
Good afternoon,
Miss America.

19:34.161 --> 19:37.965
Here, among your unpaid bills,
I find a communication.

19:38.031 --> 19:41.168
From Washington.
Washington, DC.

19:42.836 --> 19:44.872
I'm not going.

19:44.938 --> 19:48.141
Stay broke and keep moving,
that's the story of our lives.

19:48.208 --> 19:50.177
Spig, you've got
two daughters.

19:50.243 --> 19:52.179
And they've lived
in seven different houses

19:52.245 --> 19:55.282
in seven different stations
in seven different years.

19:55.348 --> 19:58.752
Back and forth across the
country and in and out of it.

19:58.819 --> 20:01.354
Well, I'm just not gonna
move them anymore.

20:01.421 --> 20:03.090
Well, have a drink.

20:03.156 --> 20:06.159
Pensacola, Coronado. What's
the difference between houses?

20:06.226 --> 20:09.496
It's a big difference to me.
'Cause I've got to live in them.

20:09.562 --> 20:12.532
Alright. One of these days,
you'll have a nice, big, fine

20:12.599 --> 20:15.602
gold-braided admiral's house
and you can live in it forever.

20:15.668 --> 20:18.105
No, Spig. I'm a little tired.

20:18.171 --> 20:21.241
I wanna relax a little bit,
I wanna drink a little bit

20:21.308 --> 20:24.111
and I wanna spend a little more
than we can afford.

20:24.177 --> 20:26.013
Okay, you've had your say.

20:26.079 --> 20:29.682
Let's throw the kids and bags in
the jalopy and get on the road.

20:29.749 --> 20:32.352
- We haven't much time.
- Okay.

20:32.419 --> 20:35.388
You take the high road,
and I'll take the low road.

20:35.455 --> 20:38.025
And we'll see who gets
to the poorhouse first.

20:38.091 --> 20:40.760
But my road leads here.
Right here.

20:40.828 --> 20:43.630
'It's like you got
a shiny desk'

20:43.696 --> 20:46.366
'with a great big drawer
marked "Navy"'

20:46.433 --> 20:49.002
'and a big drawer
marked "flying."'

20:49.069 --> 20:52.439
And a tiny little drawer
marked "Min."

20:52.505 --> 20:55.909
Et cetera, et cetera, et cetera,
and so on and so on.

20:55.976 --> 20:58.145
Well, there's not much air
in my drawer, Spig

20:58.211 --> 21:00.981
and I'm finding it
pretty tough to breathe.

21:01.048 --> 21:04.251
I think you're getting
too big for your drawers.

21:06.186 --> 21:10.190
No, no, no, ma'am.
I'll give you a clue.

21:10.257 --> 21:15.328
Coronado, California.
C like in "crap game."

21:15.395 --> 21:17.730
Yes, ma'am,
I want you to keep trying.

21:17.797 --> 21:19.532
Stick and stay,
bound to pay.

21:19.599 --> 21:22.769
- That's my way, Susie Mae.
- Hey, Spig.

21:22.836 --> 21:24.604
- Beautiful?
- Is it on the level?

21:24.671 --> 21:27.607
Ask me when we get to Bombay,
Paris or Hong Kong.

21:27.674 --> 21:31.344
Which reminds me. Since when you
been cutting orders on me, boy?

21:31.411 --> 21:35.315
Not me, Johnny.
Me and Admiral Moffett.

21:35.382 --> 21:38.085
- Pincus, what's bothering you?
- It's my foot, sir.

21:38.151 --> 21:40.720
When you win a bet from him,
his feet hurt.

21:40.787 --> 21:42.355
I keep my money
in my shoes.

21:42.422 --> 21:44.791
- Every time I pay, it hurts--
- Knock it off.

21:44.858 --> 21:47.094
Attention.

21:47.160 --> 21:49.162
- Wead, did you announce this?
- Yes, sir.

21:49.229 --> 21:51.298
- Do you like it?
- Yes, sir.

21:51.364 --> 21:54.167
War and football
draw the biggest crowds.

21:54.234 --> 21:57.537
So now we'll have an
Army-Navy race around the world.

21:57.604 --> 21:59.973
The whole country
will be sitting in on it.

22:00.040 --> 22:01.975
Congress is sitting
in on it.

22:02.042 --> 22:04.111
In fact, Congress
is sitting on it.

22:04.177 --> 22:06.779
They've ordered a special
hearing tomorrow for you and me.

22:06.846 --> 22:08.815
Shutup and get off
the phone, you stupid--

22:08.882 --> 22:10.683
Carson?

22:10.750 --> 22:12.920
Evening, sir.

22:16.323 --> 22:18.725
- Hello, Pincus.
- Good evening, sir.

22:18.791 --> 22:20.393
- How's the wife?
- Fine.

22:20.460 --> 22:23.863
- And them lovely kiddies?
- Fine. Nice to see you.

22:29.769 --> 22:33.941
Yes. Yeah. It's-it's..
I got her, Spig. Sir.

22:35.375 --> 22:37.044
Hello.

22:37.110 --> 22:38.979
Hello. Min?

22:39.046 --> 22:42.349
Yeah. Did you
get my wire, hon?

22:42.415 --> 22:45.352
It looks like we're gonna be
gone about a month.

22:45.418 --> 22:47.988
Oh, you know how I am
about writing letters.

22:48.055 --> 22:50.023
They all sound like
interoffice memos.

22:50.090 --> 22:52.459
Tell her
you love her.

22:52.525 --> 22:55.328
Looks like we'll be back here
a couple of years.

22:55.395 --> 22:58.198
Why don't you
move on out?

22:58.265 --> 23:01.368
Of course, I miss you.
That's what I'm trying to say.

23:01.434 --> 23:03.370
I found a swell apartment, hon.

23:03.436 --> 23:07.274
Just great for the kids, about
a block from a kindergarten.

23:07.340 --> 23:09.409
'Of course,
it'll be a little noisy.'

23:09.476 --> 23:12.679
'It's right near the airfield
and my squadron's planes--'

23:19.987 --> 23:21.921
Well, anyway,
I finally got her.

23:21.989 --> 23:24.091
Well, I didn't.

23:27.961 --> 23:29.729
[piano music]

23:29.796 --> 23:31.698
[people cheering]

23:41.541 --> 23:44.444
(male #3)
'Round the world.'

23:44.511 --> 23:46.413
Come and see this.

23:56.956 --> 23:58.291
[people cheering]

24:00.027 --> 24:01.861
- Thank you.
- With one flying by.

24:01.928 --> 24:04.164
- Thank you, sir.
- Your hat, sir.

24:04.231 --> 24:06.466
- Here's to your health, Wead.
- Thank you very much.

24:06.533 --> 24:10.637
Please, gentlemen, gentlemen.
This is a private party.

24:10.703 --> 24:12.439
A private Army party.

24:12.505 --> 24:15.042
And a very nice party too.
Right?

24:15.108 --> 24:17.044
- Yes.
- Cheers to you.

24:17.110 --> 24:20.347
- Alberto.
- Yeah?

24:20.413 --> 24:22.282
[speaking in foreign language]

24:24.284 --> 24:27.720
Tell them to come right out
here, it's an emergency.

24:27.787 --> 24:29.756
- Is that beer?
- Yes.

24:29.822 --> 24:31.491
In prohibition?

24:31.558 --> 24:34.261
- Don't you know it's illegal?
- I just work here.

24:34.327 --> 24:36.396
Well, you should
watch yourself.

24:36.463 --> 24:38.098
- Carson.
- Yes, sir.

24:38.165 --> 24:39.999
Compliments of
the Army Air Corps.

24:40.067 --> 24:42.369
Sir. Boy.

24:42.435 --> 24:44.271
Spig, don't you think
we oughta blow?

24:44.337 --> 24:46.206
We're gonna stir up
a mess here.

24:46.273 --> 24:49.109
Where's your curiosity,
Mr. Price?

24:49.176 --> 24:52.112
This is a rare opportunity
to study the species

24:52.179 --> 24:54.481
"Homo sapiens."

24:54.547 --> 24:56.983
Subspecies Army.

24:57.050 --> 24:59.186
To General
John J. Pershing.

24:59.252 --> 25:00.920
To Calvin Coolidge.

25:00.987 --> 25:02.522
- To Spig Wead.
- Who's he?

25:02.589 --> 25:04.391
The gentleman who sent
us the beer.

25:04.457 --> 25:06.093
- Spig Wead.
- Mr. Wead.

25:06.159 --> 25:08.928
- Sorry.
- To Mr. Wead.

25:08.995 --> 25:11.364
To our landlocked
Congress.

25:11.431 --> 25:13.800
May they quit smoking cigars
for a month

25:13.866 --> 25:16.103
and buy us some planes.

25:18.071 --> 25:19.606
[glass shattering]

25:19.672 --> 25:22.409
To celebrate being selected
as the Army flight team

25:22.475 --> 25:24.611
to beat Navy
around the world.

25:24.677 --> 25:26.679
[all cheering]

25:29.849 --> 25:31.984
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

25:32.051 --> 25:33.786
Spig, let's go on
out of here.

25:33.853 --> 25:37.990
Don't be so rude. Our host
is about to make a speech.

25:38.057 --> 25:40.560
- Continue.
- Thank you.

25:41.861 --> 25:43.896
Gentlemen...I think

25:43.963 --> 25:46.933
we'd do well now to make plans
for our victory dinner.

25:46.999 --> 25:48.901
- 'Right?'
- 'Right.'

25:48.968 --> 25:53.806
Every race implies a loser
as well as a winner.

25:53.873 --> 25:57.310
And I think it could only prove,
once again, Army sportsmanship

25:57.377 --> 26:00.613
to invite the Navy losers
to our victory dinner.

26:03.983 --> 26:05.752
Gentlemen.

26:05.818 --> 26:09.889
I presume that each team will
have the same number of men.

26:09.956 --> 26:11.691
- Correct, mister?
- Correct.

26:11.758 --> 26:16.163
Each of you, then, will invite
your opposite Navy number.

26:16.229 --> 26:21.100
For the occasion, consider him
as your big brother.

26:21.168 --> 26:23.270
[all laughing]

26:28.040 --> 26:30.109
As a representative
of the Navy

26:30.177 --> 26:32.579
I think a few words
are in order.

26:32.645 --> 26:33.646
Very few.

26:33.713 --> 26:37.484
It is 25,000 miles
around the world.

26:37.550 --> 26:41.521
We expect to finish
12,500 miles ahead of you.

26:41.588 --> 26:45.392
- End of few words. Thank you.
- Wait a minute, wait a minute.

26:45.458 --> 26:47.627
The trouble is, mister,
you've got nothing to fly.

26:47.694 --> 26:50.497
We won't need much more
than a kite to beat you.

26:50.563 --> 26:53.366
- May I make a suggestion?
- Please do.

26:54.934 --> 26:56.869
Why don't you fly this?

26:56.936 --> 26:58.838
[crowd laughing]

27:11.384 --> 27:13.753
A few more words
are in order.

27:13.820 --> 27:16.155
You're our guest.

27:16.223 --> 27:18.358
What manners!

27:18.425 --> 27:21.828
We grace your party,
we drink your liquor

27:21.894 --> 27:25.265
and I suppose
this is supposed to be funny.

27:25.332 --> 27:27.066
A matter of opinion.

27:27.133 --> 27:30.303
Well, the liquor
was pretty good.

27:30.370 --> 27:32.672
And the cake is nice.

27:33.873 --> 27:35.141
Right?

27:35.208 --> 27:36.576
(all)
Right.

27:41.180 --> 27:43.115
Thank you for the party,
gentlemen.

27:43.182 --> 27:45.352
Thank you
and thank you.

27:55.528 --> 27:56.796
Police.

27:56.863 --> 27:58.765
'Police.'

28:00.567 --> 28:02.769
Here, buddy,
hold this.

28:05.505 --> 28:08.575
Hey, let's quit.
We're even.

28:33.032 --> 28:34.967
Police. Police.

28:35.034 --> 28:36.769
The kitchen.
The kitchen.

28:43.109 --> 28:45.878
[band music]

29:04.196 --> 29:06.466
I can't think of an excuse.
Not a thing.

29:06.533 --> 29:09.001
I'm going to say that
I forgot my wife's birthday.

29:09.068 --> 29:11.704
She clobbered me.
They can't argue with that.

29:11.771 --> 29:14.841
Sure can't. But me,
I can't think of a thing.

29:17.243 --> 29:19.779
- Go ahead.
- You go ahead.

29:19.846 --> 29:21.548
You afraid?

29:21.614 --> 29:23.049
No.

29:24.951 --> 29:27.053
So we were discussing..

29:29.489 --> 29:31.758
Mr. Wead.

29:31.824 --> 29:33.726
Captain Hazard.

29:35.227 --> 29:37.797
Mr. Wead.
Captain Hazard.

29:37.864 --> 29:40.700
'Information has reached me
through certain channels'

29:40.767 --> 29:43.169
'that you two gentlemen
have met.'

29:43.235 --> 29:46.373
Just for the record,
are we at war?

29:46.439 --> 29:48.375
Where did you
get those eyes?

29:48.441 --> 29:51.110
I forgot my wife's birthday,
and she clobbered me.

29:51.177 --> 29:52.779
'And you?'

29:52.845 --> 29:55.548
Me, I can't think
of a thing.

30:00.487 --> 30:02.422
Well, gentlemen

30:02.489 --> 30:04.290
your round-the-world race
is canceled.

30:04.357 --> 30:07.760
The Army flight will take place
because they asked for it first.

30:07.827 --> 30:08.961
But no race.

30:09.028 --> 30:11.898
The Navy appreciates
your position, senator.

30:11.964 --> 30:15.234
Good. You can't win.
Might as well be a good loser.

30:15.301 --> 30:17.737
[clearing throat]

30:17.804 --> 30:20.807
However, I'm not sure the
entire Navy shares that view.

30:20.873 --> 30:23.175
- Permission to speak, sir.
- Fire away.

30:23.242 --> 30:26.979
It's our training.
We're not taught to be losers.

30:27.046 --> 30:28.648
Good or otherwise.

30:28.715 --> 30:30.883
And now we are losing carriers
that we need

30:30.950 --> 30:32.785
and planes
to fly from them.

30:32.852 --> 30:35.154
'Someday we may lose
something bigger than that.'

30:35.221 --> 30:39.125
If you can't develop
both services impartially

30:39.191 --> 30:42.662
you're either shirking your duty
or you don't know what it is.

30:42.729 --> 30:46.566
Well, son, there's a lot
of things we don't know.

30:46.633 --> 30:48.635
'But here's some of
the things we do.'

30:48.701 --> 30:52.839
Now, we've got a country yelling
"pacifism" at us...disarmament.

30:52.905 --> 30:56.208
The world is gonna live together
like one big happy family.

30:56.275 --> 30:58.811
There'll be no more war.

30:58.878 --> 31:02.148
The Army and the Navy
are going out of business.

31:04.383 --> 31:06.619
Now, you..

31:06.686 --> 31:09.722
...outside of the clubs
and barrooms..

31:09.789 --> 31:13.225
...you fight maybe one war
in a generation.

31:13.292 --> 31:17.029
Well, we have to fight those
voters every blamed two years.

31:19.999 --> 31:22.769
Now, you want us to cancel
that flight for the Army?

31:22.835 --> 31:25.204
No, sir. That stunt
may get them the bombers

31:25.271 --> 31:26.773
they need
for their service.

31:26.839 --> 31:30.477
You just want to nail down
the Lexington and Saratoga?

31:30.543 --> 31:32.044
Yes, sir.

31:32.111 --> 31:34.313
'Not just a mockup,
like the Langley.

31:34.380 --> 31:37.016
Well...they tell me

31:37.083 --> 31:39.852
there's more than one way
to skin a cat, admiral.

31:41.187 --> 31:43.490
- That'll be all, gentlemen.
- Yes, sir.

31:43.556 --> 31:45.525
By the way..

31:45.592 --> 31:47.527
...off the record,
who won that fight?

31:47.594 --> 31:49.529
- The Navy.
- The Army.

31:49.596 --> 31:51.664
[laughing]

31:51.731 --> 31:56.603
Oh, boy, where is
the ladies' retiring room?

31:56.669 --> 31:59.572
- Right in there, ma'am.
- Come on, girls.

32:07.680 --> 32:10.216
Black eyes.
Swimming pool.

32:10.282 --> 32:12.018
Congressmen.

32:12.084 --> 32:14.020
Now, what's this new scuttlebutt
you're spreading?

32:14.086 --> 32:16.689
International
seaplane races, sir.

32:16.756 --> 32:18.691
The United States
has never won them

32:18.758 --> 32:20.927
nor the Schneider Cup
that goes with the winning.

32:20.993 --> 32:24.831
- I'm aware of that, Wead.
- Alright, let's play the races.

32:24.897 --> 32:27.299
We'll hit the public
and keep hitting 'em.

32:27.366 --> 32:30.870
You okay it, sir, and we'll
bring the Schneider Cup home.

32:30.937 --> 32:35.608
Fill it with champagne and
jam it down the Army's throat.

32:35.675 --> 32:38.611
Yeah, that
would be nice.

32:38.678 --> 32:41.714
There's only one
thing wrong.

32:41.781 --> 32:44.751
Why let the Army
drink our champagne?

32:44.817 --> 32:46.919
[instrumental music]

32:54.493 --> 32:56.729
[music continues]

33:24.356 --> 33:26.525
That's your daddy up there
with the goggles.

33:26.593 --> 33:28.527
See your daddy?
He's the one beside--

33:28.595 --> 33:31.030
- Daddy.
- Him?

33:31.097 --> 33:33.299
- Yes.
- Daddy.

33:33.365 --> 33:35.101
- Daddy.
- Daddy.

33:35.167 --> 33:38.370
- Will you shut up.
- Oh, drop dead.

33:38.437 --> 33:40.139
Shh.

33:42.174 --> 33:44.143
[music continues]

33:49.315 --> 33:51.317
[piano music]

34:01.594 --> 34:02.929
[music continues]

34:05.164 --> 34:06.132
[bell ringing]

34:09.068 --> 34:14.239
This one is for old Dave,
the first to cross the line.

34:14.306 --> 34:16.208
[all cheering]

34:18.844 --> 34:20.813
- Let me drink to old Dave.
- Hear, hear.

34:20.880 --> 34:22.882
[indistinct chatter]

34:35.061 --> 34:36.629
Speech, speech.

34:36.696 --> 34:39.565
- Give me that cup.
- Yeah, pass it on.

34:39.632 --> 34:42.301
This is a happy cup,
inside and out.

34:42.368 --> 34:45.571
And here's a toast to all of you
who brought it back

34:45.638 --> 34:47.106
where it belongs.

34:47.172 --> 34:48.306
[all cheering]

34:50.476 --> 34:54.380
You're a great crew,
each and every one of you.

34:54.446 --> 34:57.817
Even Carson there,
who slept all through the race.

34:57.884 --> 35:01.688
Oh, I know, Jughead,
you were up 96 hours

35:01.754 --> 35:03.656
'getting the planes ready.'

35:03.723 --> 35:05.257
But seriously..

35:05.324 --> 35:09.028
...I want to thank every one of
you from the bottom of my heart.

35:09.095 --> 35:11.497
It was a long
back-breaking job.

35:11.563 --> 35:14.701
And those that flew know
what they owe to the others.

35:14.767 --> 35:16.803
If it hadn't been
for the cooperation

35:16.869 --> 35:18.971
and the teamwork--

35:27.413 --> 35:29.315
[band music]

35:48.868 --> 35:50.803
What's a record?

35:50.870 --> 35:54.340
I told you, it's something
nobody else ever did.

35:54.406 --> 35:58.010
Would it be a record
if daddy came home?

36:00.079 --> 36:02.782
That would be
a world's record.

36:07.920 --> 36:10.122
[pleasant music]

36:14.727 --> 36:16.829
[doorbell ringing]

36:21.333 --> 36:23.235
[music continues]

36:27.306 --> 36:29.208
[doorbell ringing]

36:33.379 --> 36:36.348
- We don't want anything.
- We're broke.

37:30.502 --> 37:32.972
We've already got
a carpet sweeper.

37:33.039 --> 37:36.042
- It ain't paid for.
- It isn't paid for.

37:36.108 --> 37:38.710
Don't you kids ever read
the newspapers?

37:38.777 --> 37:41.047
I'm your daddy.

37:41.113 --> 37:44.083
- Hey, Pickle Puss, come here.
- What is it?

37:44.150 --> 37:46.185
Remember..
Go and ask.

37:46.252 --> 37:48.754
Are you the funny man
with the goggles?

37:48.821 --> 37:50.756
I sure am, honey.

37:50.823 --> 37:53.192
Oh, daddy.

37:53.259 --> 37:56.595
And I've got a present
for each one of you.

37:56.662 --> 38:00.032
Now, there's one for you,
and one for you.

38:01.633 --> 38:04.536
- Where's your mother?
- At the bridge club.

38:04.603 --> 38:07.073
Oh, the bridge club, eh?

38:07.139 --> 38:09.876
- Oh, they're beautiful.
- Who's getting your supper?

38:09.942 --> 38:12.044
I am,
of course.

38:14.881 --> 38:17.783
- Do you want some?
- What is it?

38:17.850 --> 38:20.319
- Ah, chicken a la king.
- I sure do.

38:20.386 --> 38:22.021
Out of a tin can.

38:22.088 --> 38:24.123
- I'm hungry.
- Want some?

38:24.190 --> 38:25.324
Sure.

38:25.391 --> 38:27.526
Then you just sit down
right there.

38:27.593 --> 38:29.495
I was going to.

38:31.430 --> 38:33.599
Shall I call you daddy?

38:33.665 --> 38:35.634
- You better.
- Me too?

38:35.701 --> 38:38.137
You too, Pickle Puss.

38:38.204 --> 38:40.907
Here, wait a minute,
let me take that.

38:40.973 --> 38:42.608
I'll serve you.

38:42.674 --> 38:45.077
Sit down,
sit down.

38:55.021 --> 38:56.989
Goodnight.

38:57.056 --> 38:59.625
- You forgot something.
- What?

38:59.691 --> 39:01.460
Now, I lay me
down to sleep.

39:01.527 --> 39:03.695
(both)
I pray the Lord
my soul to keep.

39:03.762 --> 39:07.900
If I die before I wake,
I pray the Lord my soul to take.

39:07.967 --> 39:09.668
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

39:09.735 --> 39:11.003
(Wead)
'Goodnight who?'

39:11.070 --> 39:13.605
- Daddy.
- Daddy.

39:15.041 --> 39:17.143
Goodnight.

39:19.711 --> 39:21.680
Sleep tight.

39:21.747 --> 39:23.649
[soft music]

39:27.920 --> 39:30.022
[music continues]

39:52.811 --> 39:54.513
[music continues]

40:43.962 --> 40:46.232
- Hi.
- Hi.

40:46.298 --> 40:48.300
'"Home is the sailor,
home from the sea."'

40:48.367 --> 40:50.436
"And the hunter home
from the hill."

40:50.502 --> 40:53.839
Well, they cooked their supper
and then I threw them in bed.

40:53.905 --> 40:54.973
How'd it feel?

40:55.041 --> 40:57.243
Great but I blackmailed them.

40:57.309 --> 41:00.412
I brought them some beads.

41:00.479 --> 41:01.680
Well..

41:01.747 --> 41:03.949
...go ahead, get over with.

41:04.016 --> 41:05.784
Ask me where I have been.

41:05.851 --> 41:08.787
Oh, I know where you've been.
You've been playing bridge.

41:08.854 --> 41:11.090
You got behind.

41:11.157 --> 41:15.161
The winners go to dinner
and the losers stay to play.

41:16.195 --> 41:18.530
I know how it is.

41:18.597 --> 41:23.001
I was going to phone you,
and then I got a cute idea.

41:23.069 --> 41:25.071
I thought I'd come in
unannounced.

41:25.137 --> 41:28.740
- To tell you the truth--
- Why don't you?

41:28.807 --> 41:30.209
Alright.

41:30.276 --> 41:34.780
I've been thinking
what a heel I've been..

41:34.846 --> 41:37.216
...about you
and about my own kids.

41:37.283 --> 41:40.319
I don't know. When I do
something, I go all the way.

41:40.386 --> 41:44.256
Living, gambling, flying.
I tap myself out.

41:45.991 --> 41:48.394
I guess that's the way
I want it to be.

41:48.460 --> 41:50.796
Maybe, even,
it's the way I am.

41:50.862 --> 41:53.899
Star-spangled Spig.

41:53.965 --> 41:55.401
Damn the martinis

41:55.467 --> 41:58.270
full speed ahead
and don't give up the ship.

41:58.337 --> 41:59.871
[speaks in foreign language]

41:59.938 --> 42:02.474
Have a drink.

42:02.541 --> 42:05.344
Listen, Min, I'm trying to say
I've been a fool.

42:05.411 --> 42:09.315
First class, senior grade,
gold braided.

42:11.150 --> 42:12.851
So have I.

42:12.918 --> 42:15.053
Okay.

42:15.121 --> 42:16.388
Let's change it.

42:16.455 --> 42:19.658
Let's grow up
before our kids do.

42:19.725 --> 42:21.760
We'd better hurry up.

42:30.869 --> 42:33.505
[phone ringing]

42:33.572 --> 42:34.906
Phone's ringing.

42:34.973 --> 42:37.376
Oh, let it ring.

42:37.443 --> 42:40.146
Why not?
It's probably just Washington.

42:40.212 --> 42:41.847
Oh, I forgot.

42:41.913 --> 42:44.716
Do you know that you're
in the arms of the newest

42:44.783 --> 42:47.719
lieutenant commander
in the United States Navy?

42:47.786 --> 42:50.289
Star-spangled Spig.

42:50.356 --> 42:52.158
And a squadron leader.

42:52.224 --> 42:55.627
All I know is I'm in the arms
of a fella named Spig

42:55.694 --> 42:58.497
that I'm nuts about.

42:58.564 --> 43:01.433
Hey...how about getting back
to your necking

43:01.500 --> 43:03.635
with a little more enthusiasm?

43:03.702 --> 43:04.703
Right.

43:08.407 --> 43:11.410
Mommy, do you know
whose lap you're in?

43:11.477 --> 43:12.578
No.

43:12.644 --> 43:14.180
- Daddy's.
- 'Daddy's.'

43:14.246 --> 43:17.916
Go ahead, shake hands with him.

43:17.983 --> 43:20.018
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

43:20.085 --> 43:22.888
Why don't you go to bed?

43:41.006 --> 43:43.375
[girl crying]
'Mama.'

43:48.180 --> 43:49.748
'Mama.'

43:52.451 --> 43:55.421
[crying continues]

43:58.089 --> 44:00.359
(Min)
'Spig!'

44:03.262 --> 44:05.631
Spig, what..

44:12.538 --> 44:15.374
Don't, don't move me, Min.

44:15.441 --> 44:19.010
I can't..
My back.

44:19.077 --> 44:21.313
'No feeling.'

44:21.380 --> 44:23.849
Call...hospital.

44:25.417 --> 44:27.686
Naval hospital.

44:53.612 --> 44:56.448
Bilateral paralysis resulting
from indicated fracture

44:56.515 --> 44:58.116
of the fifth cervical vertebrae.

44:58.183 --> 44:59.951
(Wead)
You mean my neck's busted?

45:00.018 --> 45:01.420
That's it.

45:01.487 --> 45:03.154
(Wead)
How bad is that?

45:03.221 --> 45:05.123
Not good.

45:05.190 --> 45:06.458
What are my chances?

45:06.525 --> 45:10.496
If I operate right away,
about four to one.

45:10.562 --> 45:12.398
What are we waiting for?

45:12.464 --> 45:15.501
Permission from you
and your next of kin.

45:15.567 --> 45:18.704
I'm my next of kin,
let's go.

45:37.623 --> 45:39.525

'CC adrenalin.'

Hey.

45:57.108 --> 45:59.244
- Can you hear me, Wead?
- Yes.

45:59.311 --> 46:01.813
Open your eyes, Spig.
Can see you anything?

46:01.880 --> 46:03.048
No.

46:03.114 --> 46:04.850
- He's taking the dive.
- Hey.

46:04.916 --> 46:07.919
What's the matter, Mr. Wead?
Can't you ever win a fight?

46:07.986 --> 46:09.355
- Carson.
- Yeah, Carson.

46:09.421 --> 46:11.289
- Trying to keep me alive.
- That's right.

46:11.357 --> 46:14.025
- Well, you're doing it, thanks.
- Your welcome.

46:14.092 --> 46:15.994
Get him the hell out of here.

46:23.435 --> 46:25.537
Ma'am, throw this
under your belt.

46:25.604 --> 46:28.073
Make a new man
out of you.

46:28.139 --> 46:30.476
Thanks.

46:32.511 --> 46:33.679
[door opens]

46:54.633 --> 46:57.736
[instrumental music]

47:10.749 --> 47:12.350
- Who are you?
- Me?

47:12.418 --> 47:15.186
I'm the new corpsman assigned
to take care of Mr. Wead.

47:15.253 --> 47:18.490
Glad to cooperate with you.
I mean you just call..

47:18.557 --> 47:20.592
- Hey, you're pretty.
- We'll see about this.

47:20.659 --> 47:22.293
Yeah, you do that.

47:22.360 --> 47:23.529
(Wead)
Carson?

47:23.595 --> 47:25.431
Yes, sir, Carson.
Excuse me.

47:25.497 --> 47:26.932
(Wead)
Why?

47:26.998 --> 47:28.634
I'm your new nurse,
that's why.

47:28.700 --> 47:30.802
I'm gonna see you through
this little trouble.

47:30.869 --> 47:33.472
Now, listen, do you know
the fix that you're in?

47:33.539 --> 47:35.541
- No, do you?
- Yes, I figured it out.

47:35.607 --> 47:37.543
Now, I'm gonna brief you.

47:37.609 --> 47:39.545
(Wead)
Well, go ahead, brief.

47:39.611 --> 47:41.680
Alright. Now, look.

47:41.747 --> 47:43.882
This here is the spinal cord.

47:43.949 --> 47:47.052
It's just like the main cable
on any three-phase circuit.

47:47.118 --> 47:49.354
And when you stunted down
them stairs

47:49.421 --> 47:52.658
you busted five-sixth of it.

47:52.724 --> 47:55.126
- Can it be spliced?
- What?

47:55.193 --> 47:56.828
(Wead)
Can it be spliced?

47:56.895 --> 47:59.665
These croakers around here
will tell you it can't be done

47:59.731 --> 48:01.366
but I'm telling you it can.

48:01.433 --> 48:04.302
You remember the manual said
I couldn't splice rudder cable?

48:04.369 --> 48:05.604
(Wead)
One-sixth left.

48:05.671 --> 48:07.773
Right and that one-sixth
is gonna be enough.

48:07.839 --> 48:10.208
We're gonna learn that one-sixth
to carry the whole load

48:10.275 --> 48:12.444
all the way down
to these feeder circuits.

48:12.511 --> 48:14.546
These medics never saw
no one wire around

48:14.613 --> 48:16.782
a bad magneto post.

48:16.848 --> 48:19.050
That's true.

48:19.117 --> 48:22.287
(Wead)
Doctor, you heard him.
He gives me a chance.

48:22.353 --> 48:23.889
I heard him.

48:23.955 --> 48:25.323
But you don't?

48:25.390 --> 48:27.392
Well, we never give up hope.

48:27.459 --> 48:29.861
We'll do the best we can.

48:29.928 --> 48:32.864
Carson, when were you
busted back?

48:32.931 --> 48:34.533
Hey, Mr. Wead,
he recognized me.

48:34.600 --> 48:37.335
- Do I have to have him around?
- You want him, Spig?

48:37.402 --> 48:41.039
(Wead)
No, but I guess
he'll have to do.

48:41.106 --> 48:43.975
I've assigned Miss Crumley
to your case, Wead.

48:44.042 --> 48:45.544
Fine woman, fine nurse.

48:45.611 --> 48:48.246
Anything we can do,
Miss Crumley, just give a buzz.

48:48.313 --> 48:50.215
This is Miss Crumley.

49:03.795 --> 49:06.097
- How is he, Carson?
- What do you expect?

49:06.164 --> 49:09.400
Can't get him to eat, he won't
sleep. Hasn't eaten a thing.

49:09.467 --> 49:11.236
Hasn't touched the juice,
a piece of toast

49:11.302 --> 49:14.039
soup or something but he don't
wanna touch nothing.

49:23.915 --> 49:26.084
(Wead)
Min.

49:27.185 --> 49:29.154
- Hi.
- Hi.

49:32.558 --> 49:34.225
Kids?

49:34.292 --> 49:36.294
Oh, they're fine.

49:36.361 --> 49:38.429
Do they know?

49:38.496 --> 49:40.465
Big one does.

49:40.532 --> 49:43.101
Little one thinks
you just took off again.

49:43.168 --> 49:47.172
Oh, uh...she's worn
the beads around her neck.

49:47.238 --> 49:49.207
Is it raining?

49:49.274 --> 49:51.476
Yeah.

49:51.543 --> 49:55.714
Those doctors,
did they tell you it was no go?

49:57.448 --> 50:00.886
Look, Spig, they haven't
given up hope. Don't you.

50:00.952 --> 50:02.954
Oh, it's got
all twisted, Min.

50:03.021 --> 50:05.624
It's stay broke
and never move.

50:05.691 --> 50:07.292
I won't let you
believe that.

50:07.358 --> 50:10.161
You always yelled
that I moved around too much.

50:10.228 --> 50:12.931
Maybe you were right.

50:12.998 --> 50:16.868
You know what else you said
that was right?

50:16.935 --> 50:20.038
"Damn the martinis,
full speed ahead."

50:21.439 --> 50:23.942
Well, you be
like that, Min.

50:24.009 --> 50:27.913
You be on your own
from now on.

50:27.979 --> 50:30.616
Don't talk
like that, Spig.

50:30.682 --> 50:32.618
You'll-you'll be
alright again.

50:32.684 --> 50:34.552
No, don't pity me.

50:34.620 --> 50:37.889
I never pitied anybody
so I don't want any.

50:40.158 --> 50:44.462
Sorry, Spig.
You're right.

50:44.529 --> 50:46.497
And don't pity
yourself either.

50:46.564 --> 50:48.566
Get out in the world.

50:48.634 --> 50:52.070
Be alive, take your turn.
I took mine.

50:55.907 --> 50:59.177
Alright, Spig,
let's have it.

50:59.244 --> 51:01.079
What are you trying
to tell me?

51:01.146 --> 51:04.115
We were just about through
anyway, Min.

51:04.182 --> 51:09.087
We'd lost it,
it got away from us.

51:09.154 --> 51:13.258
Whatever it was,
and we both remember..

51:14.793 --> 51:19.464
...the good part,
the fine time..

51:19.530 --> 51:24.836
...let's not louse it up and let
it be something bad and hopeless

51:24.903 --> 51:27.639
just because
we couldn't keep it.

51:34.079 --> 51:38.784
- I'll bring the kids in.
- No, I couldn't take it.

51:43.755 --> 51:46.457
Will you tell me when?

51:46.524 --> 51:49.260
I'll tell you when.

51:58.369 --> 52:00.371
The big one..

52:01.372 --> 52:03.141
...she's like me.

52:03.208 --> 52:05.877
Don't let her get away
with a thing.

52:07.713 --> 52:10.215
And Pickle Puss..

52:10.281 --> 52:13.618
...little old Pickle Puss,
she's like..

52:13.685 --> 52:15.320
...like you.

52:16.955 --> 52:20.992
Love her hard.
She's lost without it.

52:25.731 --> 52:27.899
So long, Spig.

52:28.734 --> 52:30.401
[slow music]

52:30.468 --> 52:31.937
So long, Min.

52:36.141 --> 52:38.143
Good luck.

52:39.544 --> 52:42.347
[music continues]

53:05.871 --> 53:08.039
(Carson)
'Good morning.'

53:08.106 --> 53:11.509
- Is it still raining?
- Raining in California?

53:11.576 --> 53:14.379
Besides, don't knock the rain.
It makes the corn jump up.

53:14.445 --> 53:16.581
Cows eat the corn,
boom, you got porterhouse.

53:16.647 --> 53:19.985
I went to Tijuana, got us some
of that panther sweat.

53:20.051 --> 53:22.153
Medicinal panther sweat.

53:22.220 --> 53:23.688
(Wead)
Tequila!

53:23.755 --> 53:25.857
Besides, if we didn't
have any rain

53:25.924 --> 53:27.292
we wouldn't have any ocean.

53:27.358 --> 53:28.794
No ocean, no Navy.

53:28.860 --> 53:30.395
No Navy, no retired pay.

53:30.461 --> 53:32.864
You and me would have
to go to work.

53:32.931 --> 53:34.732
You about ready
to get started?

53:34.800 --> 53:36.201
- Why not?
- Okay.

53:36.267 --> 53:38.636
Now, that brain of yours
is like a generator.

53:38.703 --> 53:41.706
What we're gonna do is generate
that power right past that break

53:41.773 --> 53:45.643
in your spinal cord, way down
here to these feeder circuits

53:45.710 --> 53:47.178
they call nerves.

53:47.245 --> 53:51.082
Now, we're gonna start
with this big left pinkie.

53:51.149 --> 53:52.884
- You feel that?
- No.

53:52.951 --> 53:54.886
Well, anyway, that's it.

53:54.953 --> 53:58.423
Now, you start saying,
I'm gonna move that toe.

53:58.489 --> 54:00.325
Come on, mister, say it.

54:00.391 --> 54:02.260
(Wead)
Move.

54:02.327 --> 54:06.531
- Move, you little dead stump--
- No, say it nice, say it nice.

54:06.597 --> 54:08.233
Come on, say it, mister.

54:08.299 --> 54:10.969
- I'm gonna move that toe.
- I'm gonna move that toe.

54:11.036 --> 54:12.838
Alright, say it again.

54:12.904 --> 54:14.873
- I'm gonna move that toe.
- Alright, louder.

54:14.940 --> 54:17.442
- I'm gonna move that toe.
- Say it again.

54:17.508 --> 54:19.911
- I'm gonna move that.
- Keep saying it.

54:19.978 --> 54:21.612
(Wead)
I'm gonna move that toe.

54:21.679 --> 54:23.114
Believe it.

54:23.181 --> 54:26.184
- I'm gonna move that toe.
- And again.

54:26.251 --> 54:28.286
(Wead)
I'm gonna move that toe.

54:28.353 --> 54:29.620
Louder, once more.

54:29.687 --> 54:31.089
I'm gonna move that toe.

54:31.156 --> 54:32.958
Knock it off,
take a little rest.

54:33.024 --> 54:34.459
- Anything happen?
- Well, not yet.

54:34.525 --> 54:36.427
Let's put some oil
in the crankcase.

54:36.494 --> 54:39.130
Don't be impatient.
We got lots of time, Mr. Wead.

54:39.197 --> 54:40.231
We're gonna..
That's enough.

54:40.298 --> 54:42.100
We're gonna stick right at this.

54:42.167 --> 54:43.969
Mm, start saying it again.

54:44.035 --> 54:45.871
I'm gonna move that toe,
let's go.

54:45.937 --> 54:48.073
- I'm gonna move that toe.
- Come on, loud.

54:48.139 --> 54:50.341
- I'm gonna move that toe.
- Alright, believe it.

54:50.408 --> 54:53.011
- I'm gonna move that toe.
- I'm gonna move that toe.

54:53.078 --> 54:55.080
- Again.
- I'm gonna move that toe.

54:55.146 --> 54:58.816
Believe it, I'm gonna move
that toe. Come on, go.

54:58.884 --> 55:00.818
(both)
I'm gonna move that toe.

55:00.886 --> 55:02.287
Go ahead.

55:02.353 --> 55:04.455
- I'm gonna move that toe.
- Good and loud.

55:04.522 --> 55:07.125
- I'm gonna move that toe.
- Come on, Mr. Wead.

55:07.192 --> 55:09.660
- I'm gonna move that toe.
- That's it, you got it.

55:09.727 --> 55:12.163
- I'm gonna move that toe.
- That's it, go on.

55:12.230 --> 55:14.165
- I'm gonna move that toe.
- Go again.

55:14.232 --> 55:16.868
- I'm gonna move that toe.
- Once more.

55:22.640 --> 55:24.409
Get that man's name.

55:26.644 --> 55:28.546
Wait till you see what I got.

55:28.613 --> 55:31.216
I kicked myself all the way back
from that joint

55:31.282 --> 55:32.783
for not thinking of this before.

55:32.850 --> 55:36.087
Wait till you get a load
of this, we got this whipped.

55:36.154 --> 55:38.223
Tell me, what do you
see in there?

55:38.289 --> 55:41.092
- 'Dolores, room 8--'
- 'No, no, no.'

55:41.159 --> 55:43.861
'Down here, down here,
can you see this, ah?'

55:43.929 --> 55:45.363
- 'Yeah.'
- 'Alright, look at this.'

55:45.430 --> 55:47.198
- 'Do you see your big pinkie?'
- 'Yes.'

55:47.265 --> 55:49.067
Alright, keep your eye on it.

55:49.134 --> 55:52.070
Now, let's get started,
come on, same old thing.

55:52.137 --> 55:54.405
I'm gonna move that toe,
go ahead.

55:54.472 --> 55:57.342
- I'm gonna move that toe.
- Right, say it.

55:57.408 --> 56:00.245
- I'm gonna move that toe.
- Come on, mean it.

56:00.311 --> 56:03.281
- I'm gonna move that toe.
- That's right, now.

56:03.348 --> 56:06.251
- I'm gonna move that toe.
- I'm gonna move that toe.

56:06.317 --> 56:09.420
- I'm gonna move that toe.
- I'm gonna move that toe.

56:09.487 --> 56:12.157
* I'm gonna move
that toe, right *

56:12.223 --> 56:14.025
* I'm gonna move that toe *

56:14.092 --> 56:18.296
* That's right and I'm gonna
move that...one more chorus *

56:18.363 --> 56:21.132
* I'm gonna move that toe.
Go, Mr. Wead *

56:21.199 --> 56:23.601
* I'm gonna move that toe,
there you go *

56:23.668 --> 56:26.304
* I'm gonna move that toe,
go ahead *

56:26.371 --> 56:28.339
* I'm gonna move that toe *

56:28.406 --> 56:30.041
Come on with a little rhythm.

56:30.108 --> 56:31.909
* I'm gonna move that toe *

56:31.977 --> 56:34.279
* I'm gonna move that toe *

56:34.345 --> 56:36.281
* I'm gonna move that toe *

56:36.347 --> 56:39.384
* And I'm gonna move that toe,
you got to *

56:39.450 --> 56:42.420
* I'm gonna move that toe, boy *

56:42.487 --> 56:45.256
* All of God's children got
toes, so move it *

56:45.323 --> 56:48.259
* All of God's children got
toes, let's move it *

56:48.326 --> 56:51.862
* Well move it, all of God's
children got toes, let's move *

56:51.929 --> 56:54.732
Doctor's here, sir.

56:54.799 --> 56:56.467
Still at it, eh?

56:56.534 --> 56:58.869
Johnny.

56:58.936 --> 57:00.871
You know, you can overdo
those exercises.

57:00.938 --> 57:03.374
(Wead)
You mean, I could kill myself?

57:03.441 --> 57:06.577
No, I'm just saying
you could overdo the work.

57:06.644 --> 57:09.814
(Wead)
Well, I don't care too much
anymore which way it is.

57:09.880 --> 57:15.586
But one of us is gonna give,
either me or that big toe.

57:15.653 --> 57:17.555
You may just be right.

57:17.622 --> 57:20.125
You're sleeping better,
eating better.

57:21.159 --> 57:23.794
- Carson.
- Yes, sir.

57:23.861 --> 57:27.098
This is against regulations,
but I feel it might do him good.

57:27.165 --> 57:28.833
- Alcohol, sir?
- Oh, no, no, whiskey.

57:28.899 --> 57:31.636
- Is it intoxicating?
- No, just a little, few drops.

57:31.702 --> 57:35.073
I couldn't do that. Maybe just
a few drops in orange juice.

57:35.140 --> 57:36.874
- It's not habit-forming?
- No, no.

57:36.941 --> 57:40.445
- Alright, sir, trust me.
- Keep it under your hat.

57:40.511 --> 57:43.281
See you, Spig.
Keep it up.

57:47.185 --> 57:48.986
- How's your patient?
- Still alive.

57:49.054 --> 57:51.189
I'll drop in to see him.

57:53.224 --> 57:56.494
Alright, hit it and hit it hard.
I'm gonna move that toe.

57:56.561 --> 57:59.564
- I'm gonna move that toe.
- Another doctor, sir.

57:59.630 --> 58:01.132
And Miss Crumley.

58:01.199 --> 58:04.202
- Good evening, Wead.
- Good evening, doctor.

58:04.269 --> 58:06.204
Well, quite an arrangement.

58:06.271 --> 58:08.906
My idea, sir.

58:08.973 --> 58:10.641
Dolores.

58:10.708 --> 58:13.278
I was talking to the commander
of the base about

58:13.344 --> 58:14.812
Carson's temporary duty.

58:14.879 --> 58:16.547
(Wead)
Well, what did he say?

58:16.614 --> 58:20.551
As far as they're concerned,
they hope he never comes back.

58:20.618 --> 58:22.553
Will you excuse us,
Miss Crumley.

58:22.620 --> 58:23.821
Yes, doctor.

58:23.888 --> 58:26.557
- Carson.
- Yes, sir.

58:33.431 --> 58:36.467
This is against
all medical ethics, Carson.

58:36.534 --> 58:39.537
But the slightly debilitating
effects of alcohol

58:39.604 --> 58:43.508
are more than compensated
for by the physical stimulation

58:43.574 --> 58:46.511
and the marked psychological
benefit to be derived.

58:46.577 --> 58:48.613
I was thinking
the same thing myself, sir.

58:48.679 --> 58:51.549
In other words, a good slug
of booze won't hurt him.

58:51.616 --> 58:54.352
- Give him some of this.
- All of it, sir?

58:54.419 --> 58:56.354
- No, no.
- A spoonful at a time?

58:56.421 --> 58:58.089
- In water or orange juice?
- Grapefruit.

58:58.156 --> 59:00.791
Grapefruit juice, right, and
if it doesn't upset Mr. Wead

59:00.858 --> 59:03.027
we might have another bottle
for next week?

59:03.094 --> 59:04.462
- We'll see.
- Right.

59:04.529 --> 59:07.165
- But keep it under your hat.
- Trust me, sir.

59:17.408 --> 59:20.245
I can make better booze
than that in a bathtub.

59:20.311 --> 59:21.746
Alright, let's go.

59:24.115 --> 59:26.284
I'm gonna move that toe.
Come on, Mr. Wead.

59:26.351 --> 59:28.186
- I'm gonna move that toe.
- That's it.

59:28.253 --> 59:30.821
* I'm gonna move that toe,
move it *

59:30.888 --> 59:32.457
* I'm gonna move it *

59:32.523 --> 59:34.425
(Wead)
'I'm gonna move that toe.'

59:34.492 --> 59:38.129
[alarm ringing]
'I'm gonna move that toe.'

59:38.196 --> 59:40.097
'I'm gonna move that toe.'

59:41.232 --> 59:43.834
'I'm gonna move that toe.'

59:43.901 --> 59:46.271
I'm gonna move that toe.

59:46.337 --> 59:48.739
I'm gonna move that toe.

59:48.806 --> 59:51.309
I'm gonna move that toe.

59:51.376 --> 59:53.344
I'm gonna move that toe.

59:56.981 --> 59:58.849
'I've got to.'

59:58.916 --> 01:00:01.186
'I'm gonna move that toe.'

01:00:01.252 --> 01:00:03.654
'I'm gonna move that toe.'

01:00:05.756 --> 01:00:08.326
I'm gonna move that toe.

01:00:08.393 --> 01:00:10.795
I'm gonna move that toe.

01:00:10.861 --> 01:00:13.364
I'm gonna move that toe.

01:00:13.431 --> 01:00:15.533
I'm gonna move that toe.

01:00:16.501 --> 01:00:18.135
I've got to move that toe.

01:00:18.203 --> 01:00:21.239
I've got to move it.

01:00:21.306 --> 01:00:24.074
I gotta move that toe.

01:00:24.141 --> 01:00:26.344
I gotta move that toe.

01:00:27.445 --> 01:00:29.780
I gotta move that toe.

01:00:29.847 --> 01:00:31.549
I'm gonna move it.

01:00:31.616 --> 01:00:33.618
I gotta move it.

01:00:35.520 --> 01:00:38.689
- More?
- Please.

01:00:41.592 --> 01:00:44.562
Now, you enjoy
that nice fresh air.

01:01:10.655 --> 01:01:13.358
- His wife.
- Alright.

01:01:14.725 --> 01:01:15.993
Good morning.

01:01:16.060 --> 01:01:18.195
Well, look at you, pretty soft.

01:01:18.263 --> 01:01:21.732
All you gotta do is lay there,
look at children in the park.

01:01:21.799 --> 01:01:24.635
- Pretty ships out in the bay.
- What're men with legs doing?

01:01:24.702 --> 01:01:27.071
Oh, they're trying to learn
to use their heads.

01:01:27.137 --> 01:01:28.739
The millionaires are back
from Florida

01:01:28.806 --> 01:01:30.841
and the bums are out
of the poolrooms.

01:01:30.908 --> 01:01:33.110
What are you reading?
Dames, murder, what?

01:01:33.177 --> 01:01:34.245
- Love.
- Oh.

01:01:34.312 --> 01:01:35.713
Lousy.

01:01:35.780 --> 01:01:38.349
Writes like he'd used
my big toe for a pencil.

01:01:38.416 --> 01:01:40.385
You don't like any books
I bring you.

01:01:40.451 --> 01:01:42.420
Even the one I swiped
from the chaplain

01:01:42.487 --> 01:01:44.622
the one that was banned
in Boston.

01:01:44.689 --> 01:01:47.492
If you don't like my literature,
try writing some yourself.

01:01:47.558 --> 01:01:50.761
- It's not a bad idea.
- No pictures.

01:01:50.828 --> 01:01:54.198
As far as I can make out,
writing is like telling lies.

01:01:54.265 --> 01:01:56.367
Only they wrap it up
in fancy paper.

01:01:56.434 --> 01:01:59.270
You're the world's greatest
natural born liar I ever met

01:01:59.337 --> 01:02:01.472
so why don't you try it?

01:02:02.907 --> 01:02:04.909
- Eight months.
- Oh, quit bellyaching.

01:02:04.975 --> 01:02:07.912
Eight months and
it seems like eight years.

01:02:07.978 --> 01:02:11.616
What are you crying about? You
were 4-1 not to be here at all.

01:02:11.682 --> 01:02:14.084
You were about 100-1 never
to be puffing a cigarette

01:02:14.151 --> 01:02:18.155
about 500-1 not to be propped up
here like Sultan of Pandemonia.

01:02:18.222 --> 01:02:19.957
A million-to-one
not to be able to

01:02:20.024 --> 01:02:22.693
sign your name on your paycheck
which incidentally

01:02:22.760 --> 01:02:25.930
after the allotment for your
wife and kids, came to 94 bucks.

01:02:25.996 --> 01:02:28.699
I gave 10 bucks to each
of the charge accounts

01:02:28.766 --> 01:02:31.636
which left us 14 fish.
Here you are, sign it.

01:02:34.939 --> 01:02:37.708
- I'm broke.
- 'Broke? You are busted.'

01:02:37.775 --> 01:02:39.410
[knocking on door]
Come in.

01:02:41.446 --> 01:02:43.681
Oh, well, hello Alice
or is it Agatha?

01:02:43.748 --> 01:02:46.317
Or is it Dolores?
No, it couldn't be Dolores.

01:02:54.425 --> 01:02:57.362
(Carson)
'Hey, that's not bad.'

01:02:57.428 --> 01:02:59.464
'That's the best yet.'

01:02:59.530 --> 01:03:01.866
The best yet.
Well, let's get to work.

01:03:03.634 --> 01:03:05.536
(Wead)
'Who sent the flowers?'

01:03:05.603 --> 01:03:07.972
- 'Sent what?'
- 'Those red roses.'

01:03:08.038 --> 01:03:11.075
Not me, I'm not in the habit
of sending flowers to men.

01:03:11.141 --> 01:03:14.111
Let me know if you can see
it alright. Okay, there.

01:03:14.178 --> 01:03:15.846
Now, we gotta concentrate.

01:03:15.913 --> 01:03:17.748
- Was there a card in them?
- No.

01:03:17.815 --> 01:03:21.619
- Okay, now, when you think--
- You sure there was no card?

01:03:21.686 --> 01:03:24.989
I told you there was no card.
Use your brain for a generator.

01:03:25.055 --> 01:03:27.525
Let's push that power
all the way down

01:03:27.592 --> 01:03:29.560
right down here
to these feeder nerves.

01:03:29.627 --> 01:03:32.329
Right, right in here, okay?
Got the idea?

01:03:32.397 --> 01:03:34.331
Alright, now,
let's concentrate.

01:03:34.399 --> 01:03:37.201
Oh that's it,
that's the idea.

01:03:37.267 --> 01:03:39.169
It moved.

01:03:39.236 --> 01:03:40.505
It what?

01:03:40.571 --> 01:03:43.040
Mr. Wead, I-I saw..

01:03:43.107 --> 01:03:44.208
The foot.

01:03:44.274 --> 01:03:46.010
- Do it again.
- What?

01:03:46.076 --> 01:03:47.211
It move-move..

01:03:47.277 --> 01:03:49.480
Hey, nurse, doctor, anybody..

01:03:51.015 --> 01:03:53.951
He moved, he moved his toe,
Miss Crumley.

01:04:10.468 --> 01:04:12.269
Why do you have her husband

01:04:12.336 --> 01:04:14.805
coming through the door
with a gun?

01:04:14.872 --> 01:04:16.974
Did the guy
ever get away with it?

01:04:17.041 --> 01:04:19.510
I'd have been dead
a long time ago.

01:04:22.179 --> 01:04:24.348
- You're late.
- Here, right off the boat.

01:04:24.415 --> 01:04:27.117
Scraped off, ha ha.

01:04:27.184 --> 01:04:28.385
Hi, Mr. Wead.

01:04:28.453 --> 01:04:30.521
Gee, you look great, just great.

01:04:30.588 --> 01:04:33.223
- Thanks.
- Sitting up in bed and all.

01:04:33.290 --> 01:04:35.426
Still writing them stories?

01:04:35.493 --> 01:04:38.529
Arab sheiks? Murder?

01:04:41.231 --> 01:04:43.534
[whistles]

01:04:51.442 --> 01:04:53.544
[imitates barking]

01:05:21.639 --> 01:05:23.741
Now, I believe in miracles.

01:05:23.808 --> 01:05:27.478
That's all that happens,
except there.

01:05:27.545 --> 01:05:28.979
(male #5)
'What's that, Spig?'

01:05:29.046 --> 01:05:32.817
Twenty for 20.
20 stories, 20 rejections.

01:05:33.651 --> 01:05:36.521
I'm batting 0-0-0.

01:05:36.587 --> 01:05:39.056
But you're batting.

01:05:39.123 --> 01:05:42.960
Let's have it straight, doc.
You're gonna retire me?

01:05:44.194 --> 01:05:45.930
I'm afraid I am.

01:05:45.996 --> 01:05:48.365
But we've got some
good news for you, Spig.

01:05:48.432 --> 01:05:50.167
Good news.

01:05:56.574 --> 01:05:59.076
Here you are, sir.
Wheels for legs.

01:06:04.448 --> 01:06:06.884
Doctor, permission, please.

01:06:06.951 --> 01:06:09.587
Ms. Crumley has made a
request which is strictly

01:06:09.654 --> 01:06:11.689
against naval regulations.

01:06:11.756 --> 01:06:15.926
- But if my colleague concurs..
- Oh, by all means, doctor.

01:06:15.993 --> 01:06:18.529
- Uh, permission granted.
- Thank you, doctor.

01:06:18.596 --> 01:06:22.432
This is elderberry wine that
my aunt made back in Wisconsin

01:06:22.499 --> 01:06:25.502
especially for this occasion.

01:06:25.570 --> 01:06:30.507
Well, Ms. Crumley,
thanks. Thanks.

01:06:33.177 --> 01:06:36.080
[melancholic music]

01:06:59.136 --> 01:07:00.738
[exhales]

01:07:02.372 --> 01:07:03.674
Wind..

01:07:04.408 --> 01:07:08.145
...sky and...sea.

01:07:08.212 --> 01:07:10.948
And elderberry wine.

01:07:11.015 --> 01:07:14.752
- Simple things, eh, Jughead?
- Sheer poetry.

01:07:15.920 --> 01:07:18.122
Now, Mr. Wead, sit back
and close your eyes.

01:07:18.188 --> 01:07:20.324
- What for?
- Because I said so.

01:07:23.060 --> 01:07:24.962
Take a look.

01:07:27.364 --> 01:07:28.599
The Saratoga.

01:07:30.167 --> 01:07:33.704
- The first real carrier.
- Yep. Pretty, ain't she?

01:07:35.039 --> 01:07:37.141
(Wead)
'She's a beautiful lady.'

01:07:39.910 --> 01:07:43.013
[orchestral music]

01:07:45.449 --> 01:07:48.352
[aircrafts roaring]

01:08:01.165 --> 01:08:02.499
Who's upstairs?

01:08:02.566 --> 01:08:05.435
Mr. Price. That's his squadron.

01:08:05.502 --> 01:08:07.905
They've been out on maneuvers.

01:08:09.640 --> 01:08:12.209
- Take me back.
- What?

01:08:12.276 --> 01:08:14.679
I said, take me back.

01:08:17.682 --> 01:08:19.850
As you say, Mr. Wead.

01:08:19.917 --> 01:08:22.086
Let me have that tape.
Right. Thank you.

01:08:22.920 --> 01:08:26.055
Okay, Arizona, let's go.

01:08:26.122 --> 01:08:28.492
Right there. Hold it.
Right there.

01:08:28.558 --> 01:08:30.327
- Okay, sir.
- Here you go.

01:08:30.394 --> 01:08:34.430
Hold that one. Alright, sir.
Up you go now. One.

01:08:34.497 --> 01:08:37.001
Alright, Pincus, heave
at it. There we go.

01:08:37.067 --> 01:08:39.303
That's it. Take it
easy up there, sir.

01:08:39.368 --> 01:08:41.371
- Alright?
- Right.

01:08:41.438 --> 01:08:44.709
Here's yesterday's mark. Let's
try and pass that one today.

01:08:45.242 --> 01:08:46.911
Okay.

01:08:46.977 --> 01:08:49.947
Come on, pick 'em up,
lay 'em down. That's it. One.

01:08:50.014 --> 01:08:51.982
Let's try with
the other one.

01:08:52.049 --> 01:08:54.218
- Oh, Mr. Wead.
- That's it. Try the other one.

01:08:54.283 --> 01:08:56.653
Stand on it. Don't cheat
with the crutches.

01:08:56.720 --> 01:08:58.689
- Come on, try.
- Stand up on 'em, sir.

01:08:58.756 --> 01:09:01.091
Come on, pick 'em up..
Shut up, Pincus.

01:09:01.158 --> 01:09:03.227
Pick 'em up and lay
'em down. Listen.

01:09:03.292 --> 01:09:05.595
- That's it.
- That's it. One more.

01:09:05.662 --> 01:09:07.430
- I can't make..
- Come on, sure you can.

01:09:07.497 --> 01:09:10.500
No distance to go at all.
We did this yesterday, come on.

01:09:10.567 --> 01:09:12.937
- You're doing beautifully.
- Pick 'em up, lay 'em down.

01:09:13.002 --> 01:09:15.404
Come on. That's it.
Stand on that one, Mr. Wead.

01:09:15.471 --> 01:09:18.075
That's it. Don't cheat with
those crutches, I'm telling you.

01:09:18.142 --> 01:09:19.910
- That was wonderful.
- That's it.

01:09:19.977 --> 01:09:22.880
Pick 'em up, lay 'em
down. That's it.

01:09:22.947 --> 01:09:26.250
Just say it to yourself.
Pick it up and lay it down.

01:09:26.316 --> 01:09:28.285
Pick it up. That's it.
And one more.

01:09:28.352 --> 01:09:30.955
Hold on right there. Give me
another piece of tape.

01:09:31.020 --> 01:09:33.991
That's yesterday's mark. Now,
today, here's where we go today.

01:09:34.058 --> 01:09:36.660
- No, I think that..
- You're gonna make it. Come on.

01:09:36.727 --> 01:09:38.428
[all talking together]

01:09:38.495 --> 01:09:41.698
Come on, pick 'em up,
lay 'em down. Come on.

01:09:41.765 --> 01:09:43.700
- A couple more.
- Pick 'em up.

01:09:43.768 --> 01:09:46.770
Let's try one more. One more.
One more, just one more.

01:09:46.837 --> 01:09:48.337
Just one more.

01:09:48.404 --> 01:09:53.077
[all cheering]

01:09:56.580 --> 01:09:58.048
[violin music]

01:09:58.115 --> 01:09:59.349
He did it.

01:10:07.858 --> 01:10:09.259
Come.

01:10:09.326 --> 01:10:11.929
- Hiya, Spig.
- Hey, John Dale.

01:10:11.996 --> 01:10:14.264
- How are you, boy?
- Home is the sailor.

01:10:14.331 --> 01:10:17.134
You're looking good. You're
looking as stout as a mama mule.

01:10:17.201 --> 01:10:19.203
Thank you. I'm walking
or toddling.

01:10:19.269 --> 01:10:21.738
Yeah? Say, I brought
you some flowers.

01:10:21.806 --> 01:10:24.008
- Red roses?
- Well..

01:10:24.074 --> 01:10:26.310
- Sure. Red roses.
- You brought 'em for me?

01:10:26.376 --> 01:10:28.145
Yeah.

01:10:28.212 --> 01:10:30.314
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

01:10:30.380 --> 01:10:36.253
Hey! What's this? You finally
made it. Congratulations.

01:10:36.320 --> 01:10:39.056
We're gonna have to celebrate
that and wet 'em down.

01:10:39.123 --> 01:10:42.092
Maybe, we'd better wait
till I get 'em paid for.

01:10:42.159 --> 01:10:44.361
'Say, Spig, did you
see her out there?'

01:10:44.428 --> 01:10:47.131
Yeah, I saw her.

01:10:47.197 --> 01:10:49.666
She's a beaut, ain't she?

01:10:49.733 --> 01:10:51.735
She sure is.

01:10:51.802 --> 01:10:53.503
Travis wanted me
to tell you, Spig.

01:10:53.570 --> 01:10:56.606
You helped us get that ship.
You can help us again.

01:10:56.673 --> 01:10:59.409
We need a dozen more
just like her.

01:10:59.476 --> 01:11:02.279
What do you want me to do,
go back to stunting?

01:11:02.346 --> 01:11:05.215
No. But yesterday, a man
came down from Hollywood

01:11:05.282 --> 01:11:07.451
asking about
a carrier movie.

01:11:07.517 --> 01:11:11.288
He asked the old man, the old
man dumped him in my lap.

01:11:11.355 --> 01:11:14.358
I was looking around for the
next lap to put him in

01:11:14.424 --> 01:11:16.226
when I remembered
what you once said

01:11:16.293 --> 01:11:18.462
about getting the
public on our side.

01:11:18.528 --> 01:11:22.066
Getting them to help us out
with the moneymen in Congress.

01:11:22.132 --> 01:11:24.334
I figure a lot of
the public would go

01:11:24.401 --> 01:11:26.336
to see a good movie
about carriers

01:11:26.403 --> 01:11:29.139
so I...tossed him
a couple of bones

01:11:29.206 --> 01:11:31.175
and he wants
to talk to you.

01:11:31.241 --> 01:11:33.277
He wants me to write
about carriers?

01:11:33.343 --> 01:11:34.678
Why not?

01:11:34.744 --> 01:11:38.515
- How does he know I can write?
- Well, he knows he can't.

01:11:38.582 --> 01:11:43.053
Yeah. Well, I'm a...writer
without a reader.

01:11:43.120 --> 01:11:46.023
That's not exactly
what I told him.

01:11:46.857 --> 01:11:49.960
[upbeat music]

01:11:50.760 --> 01:11:52.229
Hey, that's good.

01:11:52.296 --> 01:11:54.899
Hold onto your hat and cross
your fingers. We're still..

01:11:54.965 --> 01:11:56.700
- Well, hi, Mr. Price.
- Hi, Jughead.

01:11:56.766 --> 01:11:59.403
Oh, congratulations.
Your uncle get re-elected?

01:11:59.469 --> 01:12:01.838
- Show him the mail.
- Here it goes, Mr. Frank.

01:12:01.906 --> 01:12:03.640
That's a bill,
Mr. Frank, a bill.

01:12:03.707 --> 01:12:05.943
- Milford, Austin, Carson.
- No! Not that.

01:12:06.010 --> 01:12:08.012
"Mr. Frank Wead Jr."

01:12:09.713 --> 01:12:13.450
- What is it? Another rejection?
- It's got a different envelope.

01:12:13.517 --> 01:12:15.719
They didn't send
the story back this time.

01:12:15.785 --> 01:12:17.354
- Open it up.
- Open it up.

01:12:17.421 --> 01:12:19.256
You open it.

01:12:22.592 --> 01:12:25.395
- "Pay to the order of Frank--"
- "Frank Wead Jr., 100 bucks."

01:12:25.462 --> 01:12:29.166
I told you, you let the husband
out with a gun, you'd get lucky.

01:12:29.233 --> 01:12:31.635
- One hundred bucks. We're rich.
- May I congratulate you, sir.

01:12:31.701 --> 01:12:33.703
- Me too. Congratulations.
- This calls for a celebration.

01:12:33.770 --> 01:12:36.540
- How about a drink?
- I couldn't be party to that.

01:12:36.606 --> 01:12:37.942
Well, under the circumstances..

01:12:38.008 --> 01:12:40.744
Well, under
the circumstances.

01:12:40.810 --> 01:12:43.013
Would you like these
in a vase, sir?

01:12:43.080 --> 01:12:46.183
No. Just leave
'em right here.

01:12:48.718 --> 01:12:50.220
[chuckling]

01:12:50.287 --> 01:12:54.558
- To the first story.
- To Mr. Price's stripes.

01:12:54.624 --> 01:12:56.793
And the red roses.

01:12:56.860 --> 01:12:59.563
Pretty good liar,
aren't you, Johnny?

01:12:59.629 --> 01:13:02.132
And three swell guys.

01:13:11.141 --> 01:13:13.643
I'm Commander Wead.
I think Mr.--

01:13:13.710 --> 01:13:16.080
I'm sorry, but Mr. Dodge..

01:13:20.350 --> 01:13:22.519
I believe he's expecting you,
Commander Wead.

01:13:23.954 --> 01:13:25.922
Thank you.

01:13:36.666 --> 01:13:40.304
- 'Commander Wead is here.'
- Ah! Blast it, Stonewall.

01:13:40.370 --> 01:13:42.306
I told you I was
at conference.

01:13:42.372 --> 01:13:45.375
I'm not supposed to be
disturbed under any circum..

01:13:49.579 --> 01:13:51.181
Oh.

01:13:53.083 --> 01:13:54.684
Come on in.

01:13:58.455 --> 01:14:01.058
Well, come in, come in.
It's good to see you.

01:14:01.125 --> 01:14:02.959
Thanks.

01:14:03.027 --> 01:14:05.529
Go ahead and sit down,
make yourself comfortable.

01:14:05.595 --> 01:14:07.597
You've to kinda
watch that couch.

01:14:07.664 --> 01:14:12.036
It's got a hidden spring in it
that surprises us sometimes.

01:14:15.572 --> 01:14:17.341
[Spig grunts]

01:14:21.478 --> 01:14:23.380
Watch that door.

01:14:24.581 --> 01:14:26.316
Here.

01:14:26.383 --> 01:14:29.153
- Familiar?
- Well, Commander.

01:14:29.219 --> 01:14:31.621
I find that about
this time of the afternoon

01:14:31.688 --> 01:14:34.891
a little drink's good for you,
good for the pump, you know?

01:14:34.958 --> 01:14:36.526
Here you are.

01:14:36.593 --> 01:14:40.097
I used to make excuses when I
drank in the afternoon, too.

01:14:40.164 --> 01:14:44.201
Funny thing, a man always makes
the loudest excuses to himself.

01:14:44.268 --> 01:14:45.969
Yeah, that's a fact.

01:14:46.036 --> 01:14:48.438
That sure is a fact.
Right here, commander?

01:14:48.505 --> 01:14:50.407
There you are.

01:14:51.941 --> 01:14:54.044
Commander of a
portable typewriter.

01:14:54.111 --> 01:14:56.280
That can be lot harder
than handling a battleship.

01:14:56.346 --> 01:14:58.348
- I found that out.
- Hmm.

01:14:58.415 --> 01:15:00.917
Well, I know you haven't
had much experience writing..

01:15:00.984 --> 01:15:04.321
...and none at all in pictures,
but I've heard about you.

01:15:04.388 --> 01:15:06.790
Sounded like you were
just the man I wanted

01:15:06.856 --> 01:15:08.592
for a story about the Navy.

01:15:08.658 --> 01:15:11.961
I don't want a story
just about ships and planes.

01:15:12.028 --> 01:15:15.665
- but a story about officers--
- And the men that run them.

01:15:15.732 --> 01:15:17.000
That's exactly it.

01:15:17.067 --> 01:15:20.070
For example, did you happen to
know any chief petty officers?

01:15:20.137 --> 01:15:22.106
- Do I? Hand me that cane.
- Sure, here.

01:15:22.172 --> 01:15:23.607
No, I'm kidding.

01:15:24.974 --> 01:15:29.113
Well, I-I want this story
from a pen dipped in saltwater

01:15:29.179 --> 01:15:31.315
not dry martinis.
You know what I mean?

01:15:31.381 --> 01:15:34.017
Yeah, damn the martinis,
full speed ahead.

01:15:34.084 --> 01:15:37.087
- Like to take a crack at it?
- That's why I'm here.

01:15:37.154 --> 01:15:39.756
Good. Come on, let's go.
Can I give you a hand?

01:15:39.823 --> 01:15:42.526
- No, no, I'm alright.
- Oh, I'm sorry. Sorry.

01:15:46.263 --> 01:15:48.865
I didn't know he'd been injured.
Why didn't you tell me?

01:15:48.932 --> 01:15:52.169
Give him that office there and
see he gets everything he wants.

01:15:52.236 --> 01:15:54.538
Commander, what do they
call you? Spig, isn't it?

01:15:54.604 --> 01:15:56.640
- That's right.
- Mind if I call you Spig?

01:15:56.706 --> 01:15:59.008
- Not at all.
- This is Ms. Jackson.

01:15:59.075 --> 01:16:01.445
(Dodge)
'Stonewall Jackson,
Commander Wead.'

01:16:01.511 --> 01:16:02.712
- Hello, Commander.
- Hello, Stonewall.

01:16:02.779 --> 01:16:04.748
You mind if I
call you Stonewall?

01:16:04.814 --> 01:16:07.484
- Not at all.
- She's been here for 22 years.

01:16:07.551 --> 01:16:11.488
She's my barometer. If she likes
your script, I throw it away.

01:16:11.555 --> 01:16:15.592
Wouldn't know what to do without
her. Now, go to work. Oh..

01:16:15.659 --> 01:16:17.661
You didn't ask
about your salary.

01:16:17.727 --> 01:16:19.896
Well, I figure you'll
pay me what I'm worth.

01:16:19.963 --> 01:16:23.600
What you've to worry about is
that I'm worth what you pay me.

01:16:23.667 --> 01:16:25.034
It's a deal.

01:16:25.101 --> 01:16:27.137
Well, wait a minute.
Is-is that all?

01:16:27.204 --> 01:16:28.972
Well, what do you need?
Pencil and paper?

01:16:29.038 --> 01:16:32.676
- Well, what do I write about?
- People. Navy people.

01:16:50.059 --> 01:16:54.864
Hey, what's the big idea?

01:16:54.931 --> 01:16:56.733
Laugh...that off, will you?

01:16:56.800 --> 01:16:59.169
Hey, what's the idea?
That was on the level.

01:16:59.236 --> 01:17:02.038
It was! I came down here
to knock your block off.

01:17:02.105 --> 01:17:04.374
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

01:17:04.441 --> 01:17:06.610
That's it. Fight.

01:17:06.676 --> 01:17:08.245
Fight.

01:17:10.747 --> 01:17:13.650
[crowd shouting]

01:17:19.456 --> 01:17:21.625
[shouting continues]

01:17:31.368 --> 01:17:33.837
[whistling on screen]

01:17:36.873 --> 01:17:38.942
'Get out of here.'

01:17:43.480 --> 01:17:45.415
- Well, that was very..
- Oh, nice work.

01:17:45.482 --> 01:17:47.984
Tell George that was
a good job of directing.

01:17:48.051 --> 01:17:49.919
Congratulations,
Commander.

01:17:49.986 --> 01:17:52.389
How'd you like that kid?

01:17:52.456 --> 01:17:54.258
Great. Sign him up.

01:17:58.395 --> 01:18:01.164
Spig, I've been thinking
about that title, Hell Divers.

01:18:01.231 --> 01:18:02.732
Great title.

01:18:02.799 --> 01:18:05.402
We'll have to take
it up with the Hays' office.

01:18:05.469 --> 01:18:07.971
You can't say hell
on the screen, you know?

01:18:09.639 --> 01:18:12.376
Listen, Spig, you might
just as well face it.

01:18:12.442 --> 01:18:14.478
Writing is the loneliest
job in the world.

01:18:14.544 --> 01:18:16.246
There's nobody
there but you.

01:18:16.313 --> 01:18:18.615
And I'll give you 50..
I'll give you 100-to-one

01:18:18.682 --> 01:18:21.585
your play won't be
a success.

01:18:21.651 --> 01:18:24.821
- You're not listening to me.
- Do you blame me?

01:18:24.888 --> 01:18:26.222
Not a bit.

01:18:26.290 --> 01:18:29.959
Spig, I know the stage,
I know the screen.

01:18:30.026 --> 01:18:33.530
I've toured every tank town
from East Burlap, Maine

01:18:33.597 --> 01:18:35.499
to West Burlap, Oregon.

01:18:35.565 --> 01:18:37.901
I even played
in this thing once.

01:18:37.967 --> 01:18:39.403
- 'Ulysses?'
- 'Yep.'

01:18:39.469 --> 01:18:41.271
You played in Ulysses?

01:18:41.338 --> 01:18:43.973
Bowling Green, Kentucky.
I played Robert E. Lee.

01:18:44.040 --> 01:18:47.444
Look, you got a beautiful home
here, half paid for, half empty

01:18:47.511 --> 01:18:50.980
but no. You got to go
to New York and do a play.

01:18:51.047 --> 01:18:52.316
I'll give you 1000-to-one

01:18:52.382 --> 01:18:54.784
you have the worst flop
that ever hits Broadway.

01:18:54.851 --> 01:18:56.753
[audience clapping]

01:19:05.829 --> 01:19:08.298
[people murmuring]

01:19:10.767 --> 01:19:13.303
- 'Nice going, Mr. Wead.'
- Thanks, Joe.

01:19:18.408 --> 01:19:21.277
- Looks like you got a hit.
- Jughead!

01:19:21.345 --> 01:19:23.513
Yes, sir, Carson,
late of the U.S. Navy.

01:19:23.580 --> 01:19:25.549
I thought you were
running a chicken farm.

01:19:25.615 --> 01:19:28.818
I was running one. I gave it up.
Chickens get up too early.

01:19:28.885 --> 01:19:32.221
Early to bed, early to rise.
Might as well be dead.

01:19:32.288 --> 01:19:35.892
Big playwright now, huh?
Rich as Croesus.

01:19:35.959 --> 01:19:39.896
Never had time to drop a guy a
line. Not even a Christmas card.

01:19:39.963 --> 01:19:41.598
Okay, Carson.

01:19:41.665 --> 01:19:44.100
- So I'm a stuffed shirt?
- That's right.

01:19:44.167 --> 01:19:45.669
- So I'm a horse's rump?
- Correct.

01:19:45.735 --> 01:19:48.237
Well, that was yesterday.
Where're we going now?

01:19:48.304 --> 01:19:50.407
We're going to
a saloon, where else?

01:19:51.908 --> 01:19:55.379
My chicken ranch was six miles
from my nearest neighbor.

01:19:55.445 --> 01:19:58.682
She was a Polish lady
that weighed 258 pounds.

01:19:58.748 --> 01:20:01.951
And when she started
looking good to me, I blew.

01:20:02.018 --> 01:20:03.286
[both chuckle]

01:20:03.353 --> 01:20:05.221
What you gonna do
with your loot?

01:20:05.288 --> 01:20:07.056
- You know who it's for.
- For who?

01:20:07.123 --> 01:20:08.725
The kids. Who else?

01:20:08.792 --> 01:20:11.461
- How are they doing?
- Well, they're both in school

01:20:11.528 --> 01:20:14.330
but I'm gonna get them
out there with me.

01:20:15.432 --> 01:20:17.434
[background jazz music]

01:20:18.568 --> 01:20:20.103
(Jughead)
Well..

01:20:20.169 --> 01:20:22.071
...how old can we get?

01:20:23.373 --> 01:20:26.075
You ever hear from her?

01:20:26.142 --> 01:20:27.644
She's doing fine.

01:20:27.711 --> 01:20:31.915
Has a job in San Francisco,
and she's happy.

01:20:31.981 --> 01:20:35.485
- 'Is she married?'
- Yes, to me.

01:20:35.552 --> 01:20:38.154
Well, you're gonna get the kids,
why don't you get her?

01:20:38.221 --> 01:20:41.024
Buy yourself a yacht,
take a trip around the world.

01:20:41.090 --> 01:20:42.426
'I'll sail it for you.'

01:20:42.492 --> 01:20:45.028
I'm no good for her.

01:20:45.094 --> 01:20:48.331
'Remember when they gave you two
chances to live, slim and none?'

01:20:48.398 --> 01:20:49.999
'But you made it.'

01:20:50.066 --> 01:20:53.269
And I can remember you had
two crutches and 14 bucks

01:20:53.336 --> 01:20:54.971
which you parlayed
into a fortune.

01:20:55.038 --> 01:20:59.142
Of course, that's before you
became fat and baldheaded.

01:20:59.208 --> 01:21:02.446
'Them days, all you
ever asked for was a chance.'

01:21:02.512 --> 01:21:04.714
Do you think I've got
a chance with her?

01:21:04.781 --> 01:21:07.383
Well, what makes
you think you ain't?

01:21:09.385 --> 01:21:11.187
Come on.

01:21:11.254 --> 01:21:13.356
- Where're you going?
- We're going to the airport.

01:21:13.423 --> 01:21:16.826
I'll send you to San Francisco.
After that, you're on your own.

01:21:16.893 --> 01:21:19.929
Give me that, rich guys
like you never pick up a tab.

01:21:19.996 --> 01:21:23.500
Come on, we got 46 minutes
to catch that plane.

01:21:28.572 --> 01:21:30.674
[aeroplane roaring]

01:21:40.149 --> 01:21:41.851
[doorbell buzzing]

01:21:41.918 --> 01:21:43.820
Just a minute!

01:21:52.462 --> 01:21:53.897
(Min)
Hi.

01:21:53.963 --> 01:21:55.198
Hi, Min.

01:22:20.056 --> 01:22:21.558
Big playwright.

01:22:21.625 --> 01:22:23.192
- Huh.
- Huh.

01:22:23.259 --> 01:22:26.663
I was gonna call you, and then
I decided to get cute again.

01:22:26.730 --> 01:22:29.065
Here, let me take your coat.

01:22:40.276 --> 01:22:42.278
[Min whistling]

01:22:42.345 --> 01:22:44.047
Cashmere.

01:22:51.655 --> 01:22:53.156
[sighs]

01:22:56.092 --> 01:22:58.995
- Here, let me help you.
- No, I..

01:22:59.062 --> 01:23:01.064
Sure, go ahead.

01:23:16.913 --> 01:23:18.848
Well, what are we
gonna talk about?

01:23:18.915 --> 01:23:22.385
- You heard from the kids?
- I hear from them every week.

01:23:22.451 --> 01:23:24.387
That's how I
know about you.

01:23:24.453 --> 01:23:27.223
'Your pictures,
your plays, your books.'

01:23:27.290 --> 01:23:30.827
Somehow, you always manage to
stand out in their letters.

01:23:32.428 --> 01:23:34.931
- Second year college.
- Yeah.

01:23:37.667 --> 01:23:39.803
Spig..

01:23:39.869 --> 01:23:41.871
...you mean an
awful lot to them.

01:23:41.938 --> 01:23:44.540
Why don't you have them
with you for a while?

01:23:44.608 --> 01:23:47.977
I want to. That's one
of the reasons I'm here.

01:23:48.044 --> 01:23:51.014
I think you should.
I think they need you.

01:23:51.080 --> 01:23:53.516
And I need them too.

01:23:53.583 --> 01:23:56.385
And I need more than that.

01:23:56.452 --> 01:23:58.688
I need you.

01:24:00.089 --> 01:24:01.991
Hard to believe?

01:24:05.528 --> 01:24:07.196
A little.

01:24:07.263 --> 01:24:09.298
Just believe it, Min.

01:24:09.365 --> 01:24:11.601
Don't analyze it

01:24:11.668 --> 01:24:14.337
or...take it apart
or look at it too hard.

01:24:14.403 --> 01:24:16.505
I've done all that.

01:24:16.572 --> 01:24:19.108
Just believe it.

01:24:19.175 --> 01:24:22.078
[slow violin music]

01:24:23.479 --> 01:24:25.849
I don't know, Spig.

01:24:25.915 --> 01:24:28.117
I've made a new life
for myself.

01:24:28.184 --> 01:24:32.221
At least I can be what I am
and what I want to be.

01:24:32.288 --> 01:24:36.826
- I've got somewhere, small--
- Sure, sure. You're somewhere.

01:24:36.893 --> 01:24:39.729
The kids are somewhere,
and I'm somewhere

01:24:39.796 --> 01:24:42.899
but we're really nowhere
unless we're together.

01:24:44.701 --> 01:24:48.171
If it isn't a family,
it's...it's nothing.

01:24:51.641 --> 01:24:54.744
[slow music]

01:25:02.151 --> 01:25:04.721
(Wead)
I don't know. Maybe, it's..

01:25:04.788 --> 01:25:08.624
...too late. Maybe..

01:25:10.727 --> 01:25:13.830
[music continues]

01:25:37.420 --> 01:25:39.322
[Min sobbing]

01:25:40.824 --> 01:25:42.926
[church bell ringing]

01:25:47.797 --> 01:25:49.766
(Wead)
'O'Faolain.'

01:25:49.833 --> 01:25:53.202
O'Faolain, Bridy.

01:25:53.269 --> 01:25:54.670
Bridy O'Faolain.

01:25:54.738 --> 01:25:56.405
The widow O'Faolain,
if you please.

01:25:56.472 --> 01:25:58.474
What're you dressed up for?
Where you going?

01:25:58.541 --> 01:26:01.544
To mass on the Sabbath, and it
wouldn't do you harm someday.

01:26:01.610 --> 01:26:03.847
And perhaps, you're going
to confession, too.

01:26:03.913 --> 01:26:06.716
I might. And what put that
in your evil mind, pray?

01:26:06.783 --> 01:26:08.484
This room.

01:26:08.551 --> 01:26:10.219
The kitchen.

01:26:10.286 --> 01:26:12.355
And the bar.

01:26:12.421 --> 01:26:14.023
And the ashes.

01:26:15.291 --> 01:26:18.627
And the dust.
Unmitigated sloppiness.

01:26:18.694 --> 01:26:20.897
- I'm guilty.
- We're both guilty.

01:26:20.964 --> 01:26:22.999
But we're gonna
reform, O'Faolain.

01:26:23.066 --> 01:26:26.269
Because in just a few seconds,
I'm going to pick up that phone

01:26:26.335 --> 01:26:29.472
call my wife, and she's coming
here to live with us.

01:26:29.538 --> 01:26:31.107
- Herself?
- Herself.

01:26:31.174 --> 01:26:33.777
- Your wife's coming here?
- She is.

01:26:33.843 --> 01:26:35.211
Oh, God bless you.

01:26:35.278 --> 01:26:38.147
And God bless her
for her foolishness. Oh!

01:26:38.214 --> 01:26:41.284
'The poor girl,
I'll save me beads for her.'

01:26:42.718 --> 01:26:44.821
[door closes]

01:26:45.789 --> 01:26:47.891
[sighs]

01:26:54.330 --> 01:26:55.899
Long distance?

01:26:55.965 --> 01:26:59.468
I want San Francisco.

01:26:59.535 --> 01:27:03.773
Sutter 2-3969.

01:27:03.840 --> 01:27:07.343
Crestview 4510.

01:27:07.410 --> 01:27:09.612
How long of a wait?

01:27:09.678 --> 01:27:11.180
Yes, ma'am.

01:27:11.247 --> 01:27:13.950
I'll be right here, thank you.

01:27:14.750 --> 01:27:17.854
[church bell ringing]

01:27:36.772 --> 01:27:38.875
[door opens]

01:27:40.209 --> 01:27:42.645
The radio.
The Japanese. Pearl Harbor.

01:27:42.711 --> 01:27:45.414
- What are you talking about?
- The newsboy just told me.

01:27:45.481 --> 01:27:49.052
- The Japanese bombed.
- Turn on the radio.

01:27:54.991 --> 01:27:57.994
(male announcer)
'...appeared over Diamond Head
and launched an attack'

01:27:58.061 --> 01:28:00.496
'on the giant U.S. Naval base
at Pearl Harbor.'

01:28:00.563 --> 01:28:02.966
'The planes appeared
utterly without warning'

01:28:03.032 --> 01:28:05.101
'apparently coming
from aircraft carriers'

01:28:05.168 --> 01:28:07.403
'which had been moved
forward during the night.'

01:28:07.470 --> 01:28:10.539
'The enemy craft were over
the island of Oahu for one hour'

01:28:10.606 --> 01:28:13.409
'and 20 minutes bombing the
naval base and nearby..'

01:28:13.476 --> 01:28:15.044
[phone ringing]

01:28:15.111 --> 01:28:17.046
'The White House has
just announced that'

01:28:17.113 --> 01:28:19.148
'one old battleship capsized'

01:28:19.215 --> 01:28:21.650
'several others were hit,

01:28:21.717 --> 01:28:23.853
'American casualties
were said to total 3000..'

01:28:23.920 --> 01:28:25.088
Turn it off.

01:28:25.154 --> 01:28:28.224
'...of which 1500 were killed.'

01:28:28.291 --> 01:28:31.394
[phone ringing continues]

01:28:40.669 --> 01:28:42.571
Hello.

01:28:42.638 --> 01:28:45.474
Min?

01:28:45.541 --> 01:28:47.443
Did you hear it?

01:28:49.078 --> 01:28:51.514
I just turned off the radio.

01:28:53.983 --> 01:28:55.718
Of course, you'll try, Spig.

01:28:55.784 --> 01:29:00.056
Well, I'll try. You know,
I've got to try, Min.

01:29:01.090 --> 01:29:02.691
I'll go there.

01:29:02.758 --> 01:29:04.827
To Washington.

01:29:04.894 --> 01:29:06.595
Talk to them.

01:29:06.662 --> 01:29:09.065
Maybe they won't
have me, I don't know.

01:29:11.534 --> 01:29:15.004
If they don't have you,
Spig...I will.

01:29:16.572 --> 01:29:20.076
(Wead on phone)
'Well, that's all I need.'

01:29:20.143 --> 01:29:22.511
That's all I've got, Spig.

01:29:24.247 --> 01:29:27.083
I said that's all I've got.

01:29:30.920 --> 01:29:33.089
Bye, Spig.

01:29:33.990 --> 01:29:35.591
'Min..'

01:29:37.026 --> 01:29:39.595
'...well, goodbye,
sailor. I..'

01:29:49.038 --> 01:29:51.140
[sobbing]

01:29:59.848 --> 01:30:02.952
[melancholic music
on gramophone]

01:30:11.094 --> 01:30:13.329
Stop. Stop.
Stop. Stop!

01:30:17.166 --> 01:30:19.835
And you want
active duty?

01:30:19.902 --> 01:30:21.370
Combat?

01:30:21.437 --> 01:30:23.772
I've never been under fire.
You know that, sir.

01:30:23.839 --> 01:30:27.176
- 'You looking for a thrill?'
- Just a fight.

01:30:27.243 --> 01:30:31.047
Spig, let's talk like
what we are, old friends.

01:30:31.114 --> 01:30:34.450
Old, I said. Even a sailor
must do it, get old.

01:30:34.517 --> 01:30:36.919
Like Nimitz, Halsey,
and Pete Mitscher?

01:30:36.986 --> 01:30:38.787
'Spig, you know
better than this.'

01:30:38.854 --> 01:30:42.258
War gets fought at a desk
just as it does on a flattop.

01:30:42.325 --> 01:30:44.860
It gets won and
lost by logistics.

01:30:44.927 --> 01:30:46.895
Ah, I'll let you
in on something.

01:30:46.962 --> 01:30:50.933
Every plan we ever had is down
at the bottom of Pearl Harbor.

01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:53.036
'Yeah, we lost
our Sunday shirt.'

01:30:53.102 --> 01:30:55.404
- Well, that bad?
- 'Yeah, that bad.'

01:30:58.974 --> 01:31:00.343
Now, you see this?

01:31:00.409 --> 01:31:03.012
Well, this is sort
of a flattop.

01:31:03.079 --> 01:31:06.482
I'm sticking my neck out.
You want one, you can have one.

01:31:08.717 --> 01:31:10.919
I'll try it for size,
Admiral, and thanks.

01:31:10.986 --> 01:31:13.356
The name's still Jack.
Farrington, get him a uniform

01:31:13.422 --> 01:31:17.060
a desk, and a drink. He's going
to work for the first time.

01:31:17.126 --> 01:31:19.328
Aye-aye, sir.

01:31:19.395 --> 01:31:20.663
I'm alright.

01:31:24.500 --> 01:31:26.369
(man on speaker)
'The carrier, Hornet.'

01:31:28.671 --> 01:31:33.576
'Notice the hits
by enemy action.'

01:31:33.642 --> 01:31:36.545
'Three Kamikazes.'

01:31:36.612 --> 01:31:38.047
'Two hits.'

01:31:39.782 --> 01:31:41.717
'One forward..'

01:31:41.784 --> 01:31:43.619
'...one mid-ship.'

01:31:43.686 --> 01:31:45.321
'Not a chance.'

01:31:45.388 --> 01:31:48.057
Notice the
abandon-ship drill.

01:31:51.260 --> 01:31:52.928
'Morale excellent.'

01:31:52.995 --> 01:31:55.964
We have only one
carrier left, gentlemen.

01:31:56.031 --> 01:31:59.568
Repeat, one carrier left.

01:31:59.635 --> 01:32:00.903
Enterprise.

01:32:00.969 --> 01:32:04.507
- And more on the way.
- Well, they won't help..

01:32:04.573 --> 01:32:06.575
They won't help now.

01:32:06.642 --> 01:32:09.612
Every battle we fight
depends on the big carriers.

01:32:09.678 --> 01:32:13.316
But there's a limiting factor,
planes and crews.

01:32:15.518 --> 01:32:18.787
Can't carry enough. There oughta
be a way to keep 'em in action.

01:32:18.854 --> 01:32:21.457
- Yeah, but how?
- Well, it's a simple thing.

01:32:21.524 --> 01:32:26.695
It keeps...going around in
my head like a forgotten name.

01:32:26.762 --> 01:32:29.765
What do you do when you're
stuck like that, Levi?

01:32:29.832 --> 01:32:32.835
Well, I go through
the alphabet backwards, sir.

01:32:32.901 --> 01:32:35.171
I take a long cold beer.

01:32:35.238 --> 01:32:39.108
Back in Hollywood, we cut
to the seventhcavalry.

01:32:39.175 --> 01:32:41.144
[chuckles]

01:32:46.549 --> 01:32:49.452
[dramatic music]

01:33:03.399 --> 01:33:06.435
[music continues]

01:33:35.664 --> 01:33:37.766
[bell rings]
Attention!

01:33:42.471 --> 01:33:44.440
Johnny.

01:33:44.507 --> 01:33:46.475
I've been looking
high and low for you.

01:33:46.542 --> 01:33:47.943
Well, what do you know?

01:33:48.010 --> 01:33:50.646
- Yeah, my uncle got re-elected.
- You got your command.

01:33:50.713 --> 01:33:53.549
- Task force.
- Combat, you lucky dog.

01:33:53.616 --> 01:33:55.818
Say, and you, I have
been calling your hotel

01:33:55.884 --> 01:33:58.053
and you haven't
checked in for three days.

01:33:58.120 --> 01:34:00.055
What're you doing,
sleeping on this deck?

01:34:00.122 --> 01:34:01.857
- Well..
- I've got three hours to kill.

01:34:01.924 --> 01:34:05.561
I got a jeep outside. I'll buy
you the tallest, coldest beer--

01:34:05.628 --> 01:34:07.896
- You got a what outside?
- A jeep.

01:34:07.963 --> 01:34:10.633
That's it. That's the
forgotten name.

01:34:10.699 --> 01:34:13.302
Jeep, Jeep carriers.

01:34:13.369 --> 01:34:15.938
It was there all the time,
I knew it'd be simple

01:34:16.004 --> 01:34:19.342
once we thought of it.
Hand me that...Liberty ship.

01:34:19.408 --> 01:34:21.710
Give me a chair.
Drag up a chair.

01:34:24.413 --> 01:34:26.014
That's it, Johnny.

01:34:26.081 --> 01:34:29.051
Jeep carriers.

01:34:29.117 --> 01:34:32.120
That's the limiting factor.

01:34:32.187 --> 01:34:34.690
Spig, I haven't got
too much time..

01:34:34.757 --> 01:34:35.958
Yeah?

01:34:38.861 --> 01:34:41.497
- So long, partner.
- So long.

01:34:43.766 --> 01:34:45.668
That's what
we've been needing.

01:34:45.734 --> 01:34:48.637
[bell ringing]
Johnny.

01:34:48.704 --> 01:34:50.239
John Dale.

01:34:53.276 --> 01:34:55.444
[bell ringing]

01:35:11.960 --> 01:35:13.662
[bell rings]
Attention!

01:35:13.729 --> 01:35:15.264
At ease.

01:35:16.932 --> 01:35:19.935
- Soryu, Akagi, Kaga.
- I know all that.

01:35:23.506 --> 01:35:24.840
- Wead?
- Yes, sir.

01:35:24.907 --> 01:35:26.241
Let's have it.

01:35:26.309 --> 01:35:29.945
These big combat carriers are
still the spear-point of battle.

01:35:30.012 --> 01:35:32.581
But now, backing them up,
we have these jeep carriers

01:35:32.648 --> 01:35:34.617
loaded with planes and crews.

01:35:34.683 --> 01:35:37.886
If the big carrier loses
a plane, she radios back

01:35:37.953 --> 01:35:41.156
and a replacement
is immediately underway.

01:35:41.223 --> 01:35:43.626
The big carrier
stays in action.

01:35:43.692 --> 01:35:46.862
- You can get this on paper?
- Yes, sir.

01:35:46.929 --> 01:35:48.831
I like it.
Write it up.

01:35:50.132 --> 01:35:51.300
Eureka.

01:35:55.704 --> 01:35:58.541
[bell ringing
and shouting]

01:35:58.607 --> 01:36:00.543
Cut me some orders, boy.

01:36:00.609 --> 01:36:03.312
[melancholic music]

01:36:08.817 --> 01:36:11.119
- Welcome home, sailor.
- Hello, Jock.

01:36:11.186 --> 01:36:13.789
- How are you feeling?
- Like an old fire horse.

01:36:13.856 --> 01:36:14.957
Good.

01:36:15.023 --> 01:36:17.159
- Thanks for everything.
- Thanks for nothing.

01:36:17.225 --> 01:36:21.397
Well, there she is.
She's all yours.

01:36:21.464 --> 01:36:24.733
Oh, I want you to say hello
to an old pal of yours.

01:36:24.800 --> 01:36:26.769
- Doc.
- How are you, fella?

01:36:26.835 --> 01:36:31.206
Oh, half-man, half-worm,
and half-wit.

01:36:31.273 --> 01:36:33.942
Well, I got the last
chapter of the book.

01:36:34.009 --> 01:36:36.845
Come on, Spig, I'll show
you to the royal suite.

01:36:36.912 --> 01:36:38.681
Knock it off.

01:36:46.355 --> 01:36:48.424
Sir.

01:36:48.491 --> 01:36:50.993
(Wead)
Jughead!

01:36:51.059 --> 01:36:55.263
I don't believe it.

01:36:55.330 --> 01:36:57.933
- How'd you wangle this?
- Same as you.

01:36:58.000 --> 01:36:59.468
Drag, pull, juice.

01:36:59.535 --> 01:37:01.470
I know where
the bodies are buried.

01:37:01.537 --> 01:37:04.339
You buried them.

01:37:04.407 --> 01:37:06.008
Thanks, Jughead.

01:37:08.243 --> 01:37:11.246
So you finally made it.

01:37:11.313 --> 01:37:13.148
Come on, let me show you around.

01:37:13.215 --> 01:37:15.784
- I got the crap game.
- And everything else.

01:37:15.851 --> 01:37:17.753
[all laughing]

01:37:20.989 --> 01:37:23.492
[ship horn blaring]

01:37:30.433 --> 01:37:33.436
- You look a little beat up.
- Yeah, too many soft chairs.

01:37:33.502 --> 01:37:35.471
Living off the fat
of the land, eh?

01:37:35.538 --> 01:37:37.473
Well, the sea will
bring it out.

01:37:37.540 --> 01:37:39.908
Don't worry. I'll make
a man out of you again.

01:37:39.975 --> 01:37:43.378
And the next time you walk
in that door, sailor, salute.

01:37:43.446 --> 01:37:44.713
Aye-aye, sir.

01:37:44.780 --> 01:37:46.915
Hey, wait. This is
pretty nice, huh?

01:37:46.982 --> 01:37:50.586
You and me and
old Jock and the doc.

01:37:50.653 --> 01:37:54.089
All we need now is Pincus.
Whatever happened to Pincus?

01:37:54.156 --> 01:37:56.625
He made it. Back
to the old Arizona.

01:37:58.761 --> 01:38:00.863
- Pearl Harbor?
- Yeah.

01:38:02.698 --> 01:38:05.033
- You know where we're going?
- Got a general idea.

01:38:05.100 --> 01:38:07.202
You're gonna see yourself
some action, sir.

01:38:07.269 --> 01:38:10.539
(man on radio)
'All hands, man your
battle station.'

01:38:10.606 --> 01:38:12.775
[explosions]

01:38:12.841 --> 01:38:15.077
(man on transmitter)
'Pilots, turn your planes.'

01:38:15.143 --> 01:38:16.979
Yep, plenty of action.

01:38:17.045 --> 01:38:19.448
You're gonna see
island grabbing the hard way.

01:38:19.515 --> 01:38:21.349
'Step by step
on the Tokyo road.'

01:38:21.416 --> 01:38:23.786
'You'll see us pounding away
with everything we've got.'

01:38:23.852 --> 01:38:26.989
'And them pounding back at us
with everything they've got.'

01:38:27.055 --> 01:38:28.524
[planes droning]

01:38:28.591 --> 01:38:31.059
[gun firing]

01:39:06.161 --> 01:39:08.497
[gun firing continues]

01:39:15.604 --> 01:39:17.472
[speaking indistinctly]

01:39:28.851 --> 01:39:32.454
(man on radio)
'Crash on the flight deck.
Crash on the flight deck.'

01:39:32.521 --> 01:39:34.757
One in on the deck..

01:39:34.823 --> 01:39:37.259
'We'll see if your jeep carriers
can send replacement planes'

01:39:37.325 --> 01:39:40.596
'fast enough to keep the big
carriers in their slugger.'

01:39:40.663 --> 01:39:43.165
'Because the big carriers
are it, sailor.'

01:39:43.231 --> 01:39:45.200
'High, low, jack and the game.'

01:39:54.476 --> 01:39:57.813
Nine minutes, 56 seconds.
You owe me a sawbuck.

01:40:33.649 --> 01:40:35.483
Good job, Spig. Swell show.

01:40:35.550 --> 01:40:38.120
We'd had your plan at Tarawa,
we could've saved casualties.

01:40:38.186 --> 01:40:40.555
When you gonna sleep?
You've been going for 54 hours.

01:40:40.623 --> 01:40:43.391
- I'll sleep after the party.
- The party's as good as over.

01:40:43.458 --> 01:40:46.662
- I'm as good as asleep here.
- Captain, make him go to bed.

01:40:46.729 --> 01:40:48.363
- Go to bed.
- No, sir.

01:40:48.430 --> 01:40:50.799
Here's the Oscar, sir.

01:40:50.866 --> 01:40:53.902
Uh, we've got them now.
Listen to this, Jughead.

01:40:53.969 --> 01:40:57.272
"Formal resistance has collapsed
on all fronts as of 12:42.

01:40:57.339 --> 01:40:59.274
"Vigilance against
die-hard individual action

01:40:59.341 --> 01:41:01.777
"will be maintained, but your
commander is signaling

01:41:01.844 --> 01:41:03.779
"Washington that
Kwajalein is ours

01:41:03.846 --> 01:41:06.314
and signals each
of you, well done."

01:41:06.381 --> 01:41:10.152
- A clear path to the Marianas.
- A clear path to bed for you.

01:41:10.218 --> 01:41:12.587
- Haven't even got under fire.
- Get under the sheets.

01:41:12.655 --> 01:41:14.589
Captain, make it
an order, will you?

01:41:14.657 --> 01:41:17.325
- That's an order, Spig.
- I'll fix the coffee.

01:41:17.392 --> 01:41:19.294
No cream, no sugar.

01:41:25.300 --> 01:41:27.369
[beeping]

01:41:27.435 --> 01:41:30.605
(man on radio)
'General quarters. All hands,
man your battle stations.'

01:41:33.742 --> 01:41:36.578
[plane whirring]

01:41:36.645 --> 01:41:38.914
[rapid firing]

01:41:51.126 --> 01:41:54.963
I-I guess I forgot
to stick out my hand.

01:41:57.032 --> 01:41:58.066
Jug.

01:41:59.601 --> 01:42:00.836
Jughead!

01:42:00.903 --> 01:42:03.305
[guns firing]

01:42:24.392 --> 01:42:26.394
[seagulls squawking]

01:42:30.565 --> 01:42:32.300
Wait a minute,
wait a minute.

01:42:32.367 --> 01:42:34.569
This is a game
you have to think.

01:42:34.636 --> 01:42:36.204
Use my brain little bit when..

01:42:36.271 --> 01:42:37.339
Ten-hut!

01:42:37.405 --> 01:42:39.207
- Relax.
- Hi.

01:42:39.274 --> 01:42:41.276
Hi.

01:42:41.343 --> 01:42:43.178
Well..

01:42:43.245 --> 01:42:46.614
I had to get to battle.
Worried I got you killed.

01:42:46.681 --> 01:42:50.118
I'm a Gemini. You can't kill me
until after 17th of the month.

01:42:50.185 --> 01:42:55.090
Anyway, Frank Merriwell Jr.
had to...see action.

01:42:55.157 --> 01:42:57.559
Oh, you did me a favor.
I'm a wounded hero.

01:42:57.625 --> 01:43:01.029
They're even gonna give me a
medal. I got a month at Waikiki

01:43:01.096 --> 01:43:04.099
in the sun and the surf.
Gin rummy. Gin.

01:43:04.166 --> 01:43:06.168
And those beautiful nurses.

01:43:06.234 --> 01:43:08.804
Do you remember the nurse
you had in San Diego?

01:43:08.871 --> 01:43:11.073
- Ms. Crumley.
- I want you to meet her son.

01:43:11.139 --> 01:43:13.441
- The name is, McGuffy, sir.
- McGuffy Crumley.

01:43:13.508 --> 01:43:16.912
Put the black king on red ace.
He even cheats when he plays.

01:43:16.979 --> 01:43:19.081
Is there anything you need?

01:43:19.147 --> 01:43:21.850
Yeah, but you ain't
got it out here.

01:43:21.917 --> 01:43:23.986
Well, look, Jughead.
I'm trying to say is--

01:43:24.052 --> 01:43:26.989
You don't look good, yourself.
Why don't you move over?

01:43:27.055 --> 01:43:28.423
Yeah.

01:43:29.591 --> 01:43:30.893
Well, I..

01:43:30.959 --> 01:43:33.228
Drop in and see a guy, will ya?

01:43:35.197 --> 01:43:36.464
Yeah.

01:43:38.500 --> 01:43:39.501
'Yeah.'

01:44:05.560 --> 01:44:06.761
[gasping]

01:44:06.829 --> 01:44:08.563
Jug.

01:44:08.630 --> 01:44:10.332
[grunts]

01:44:23.745 --> 01:44:26.714
There it is, Spig.

01:44:26.781 --> 01:44:30.018
Looks like a...drunken
grasshopper.

01:44:30.085 --> 01:44:33.021
- It's all good?
- Lousy.

01:44:33.088 --> 01:44:35.958
How long does it say?

01:44:36.024 --> 01:44:40.328
Three days,
three months, three years.

01:44:40.395 --> 01:44:42.130
Okay?

01:44:42.197 --> 01:44:45.033
Why not?

01:44:45.100 --> 01:44:48.003
Like to have you
do me a favor, Johnny.

01:44:48.070 --> 01:44:50.672
- lf I can.
- Even if you can't.

01:44:50.738 --> 01:44:52.240
Try me.

01:44:52.307 --> 01:44:55.710
A lot of people went to some
trouble to get me out here.

01:44:55.777 --> 01:44:57.079
I know.

01:44:57.145 --> 01:44:59.281
I don't want them
to blame themselves.

01:44:59.347 --> 01:45:00.748
Why should they?

01:45:00.815 --> 01:45:03.118
I don't know why.
I just don't want it.

01:45:03.185 --> 01:45:08.323
- What do you want?
- You to snip a little red tape.

01:45:08.390 --> 01:45:09.925
Go on.

01:45:09.992 --> 01:45:13.261
I'd like to go over
the side quietly.

01:45:13.328 --> 01:45:15.297
Retire.

01:45:15.363 --> 01:45:17.132
Fatigue?

01:45:17.199 --> 01:45:18.500
Yeah.

01:45:19.767 --> 01:45:21.769
Yeah.

01:45:21.836 --> 01:45:25.540
Let them think
I was beat up.

01:45:25.607 --> 01:45:27.876
Alright, Spig.

01:45:27.943 --> 01:45:31.013
[melancholic music]

01:45:41.023 --> 01:45:43.458
[music continues]

01:46:52.460 --> 01:46:55.263
Will you get a load of
all the brass over there?

01:46:55.330 --> 01:46:58.000
- Yeah.
- Army brass too.

01:47:00.202 --> 01:47:02.704
[ship whistle]

01:47:06.941 --> 01:47:09.411
Present arms!

01:47:21.856 --> 01:47:24.226
[sharp whistle]

01:47:27.229 --> 01:47:29.964
- Well, Spig.
- Thanks for the ride, Jock.

01:47:30.032 --> 01:47:32.634
Good luck, fella.
That'll do at the side.

01:47:37.439 --> 01:47:39.974
(male #6)
'Order arms!'

01:48:05.767 --> 01:48:07.169
(Wead)
Johnny.

01:48:10.105 --> 01:48:12.074
Thank you, sir.

01:48:16.010 --> 01:48:18.546
- Shorty.
- Hiya, Spig.

01:48:21.149 --> 01:48:23.151
- No cake?
- No cakes.

01:48:23.218 --> 01:48:25.820
And no swimming pools.

01:48:25.887 --> 01:48:27.789
Good luck, fella.

01:48:35.663 --> 01:48:36.798
Salute!

01:48:40.001 --> 01:48:42.370
[band music]

01:48:56.851 --> 01:48:58.753
So long.

01:49:01.256 --> 01:49:03.558
[music continues]
