WEBVTT

00:09.042 --> 00:11.411
We still have a few minutes
left, and all our lines
are open.

00:11.411 --> 00:14.312
Uh... shall I attempt
another joke?

00:14.514 --> 00:15.071
No!

00:16.583 --> 00:17.584
No.

00:17.584 --> 00:20.587
All right, then.

00:20.587 --> 00:22.589
Come on, callers, don't be shy
.

00:22.589 --> 00:25.592
There's still time
to talk with the good doctor.

00:25.592 --> 00:28.083
Five open lines.

00:31.197 --> 00:33.433
Who's this, then, Roz?

00:33.433 --> 00:36.703
On line one, uh,
whom do we have?

00:36.703 --> 00:39.205
I understand
we have... Susan,

00:39.205 --> 00:42.776
who recently moved here
from... Texas.

00:42.776 --> 00:45.074
(mouthing)

00:45.378 --> 00:48.348
Go ahead, Susan.
I'm listening.

00:48.348 --> 00:50.111
(Texas accent):
Hi, Dr. Crane.

00:53.119 --> 00:55.422
I'm new in town, from Texas,

00:55.422 --> 00:58.118
and, uh, I just
left my husband.

00:58.224 --> 01:01.284
I see.
And why did you do that?

01:01.795 --> 01:03.285
Well, uh...

01:03.797 --> 01:05.788
Oh, I know!
He was abusive.

01:08.301 --> 01:09.791
That couldn't have been
easy for you.

01:10.303 --> 01:11.702
Well, my girlfriend
helped me.

01:12.138 --> 01:14.240
We just got in her convertible
and drove through the desert

01:14.240 --> 01:15.542
and we stopped
at this honky-tonk,

01:15.542 --> 01:17.243
I started dancing with this
cowboy-- long story short,

01:17.243 --> 01:18.403
he roughed me up,
my friend killed him--

01:18.745 --> 01:21.314
but then...

01:21.314 --> 01:23.316
we met the
cutest cowboy,

01:23.316 --> 01:25.318
but he stole all our money,

01:25.318 --> 01:26.808
so we robbed a gas station
and blew up a tanker truck
...

01:27.320 --> 01:29.322
Yes, I'm afraid
we're out of time.

01:29.322 --> 01:33.259
I will finish with you
off the air, Susan.

01:33.259 --> 01:35.128
Meanwhile, this is
Dr. Frasier Crane,

01:35.128 --> 01:38.188
saying good day, Seattle,
and good mental health.

01:40.500 --> 01:42.491
Well, thank you, Thelma.

01:43.203 --> 01:44.504
Or is it Louise?

01:44.504 --> 01:46.206
Don't snap at me

01:46.206 --> 01:48.197
because you didn't get
any phone calls today.

01:48.508 --> 01:50.210
I told you not to put me
on the spot again.

01:50.210 --> 01:52.212
I'm sorry, Roz,
but I was desperate.

01:52.212 --> 01:54.214
You know, I really
think you were closer

01:54.214 --> 01:56.216
with that character
yesterday--

01:56.216 --> 01:57.517
the young teen
who moved into the town

01:57.517 --> 01:59.519
that had banned dancing.

01:59.519 --> 02:02.420
Now that, that had
the tang of reality.

02:02.622 --> 02:04.681
That was Footloose,
you idiot.

02:11.731 --> 02:13.733
Hey! I thought you were working tonight.

02:13.733 --> 02:16.736
I got the night off and I am
kidnapping you for the weekend.

02:16.736 --> 02:18.294
Oh! Where we going?

02:18.505 --> 02:20.273
My boss gave me
his house in the mountains.

02:20.273 --> 02:22.264
It's very romantic.

02:22.575 --> 02:24.277
And there's this
little family of deer

02:24.277 --> 02:25.578
that comes right up
to the window, so you
might want to bring...

02:25.578 --> 02:27.280
My camera! I will!

02:27.280 --> 02:29.441
Well, I was going to say
gun, but suit yourself.

02:29.716 --> 02:30.783
Oh, you are going
to love it.

02:30.783 --> 02:32.273
There's this amazing view of the lake.

02:32.785 --> 02:34.287
You can see every
star in the sky.

02:34.287 --> 02:35.185
Wow!

02:35.488 --> 02:36.556
Is there a VCR there?

02:36.556 --> 02:38.258
'Cause I just
bought a couple of

02:38.258 --> 02:40.560
great old Ginger Rogers
and Fred Astaire movies.

02:40.560 --> 02:42.262
Why didn't you just rent them?

02:42.262 --> 02:43.563
I did. Last August.

02:43.563 --> 02:45.265
Ah. Okay, let's get moving.

02:45.265 --> 02:47.267
I don't want
to get stuck in traffic.

02:47.267 --> 02:49.269
Sounds good.
I'll pack some food.

02:49.269 --> 02:50.566
That was really nice of your
boss to give you the cabin.

02:51.271 --> 02:51.566
What made him do it?

02:52.272 --> 02:53.933
I put out.

02:54.340 --> 02:55.238
That's my girl.

03:01.414 --> 03:03.683
I hate people.

03:03.683 --> 03:05.251
What's the matter with you?

03:05.251 --> 03:08.254
In a perfect ending
to a perfect day,

03:08.254 --> 03:11.257
the driver next to me swerved
to avoid hitting a squirrel,

03:11.257 --> 03:12.759
running me into a pothole

03:12.759 --> 03:16.262
and drenching me
in coffee.

03:16.262 --> 03:18.631
I hate squirrels, too.

03:18.631 --> 03:20.600
Well, maybe it was for the best.

03:20.600 --> 03:22.329
The coffee might've
made you irritable.

03:24.370 --> 03:26.372
My show today
was a fiasco--

03:26.372 --> 03:28.374
the second day in a row
we had virtually no callers.

03:28.374 --> 03:31.377
It's getting harder and
harder to blame it on Roz.

03:31.377 --> 03:32.674
Well, maybe you fixed everybody.

03:33.379 --> 03:33.674
Oh, wait!

03:34.280 --> 03:35.348
There was one caller:

03:35.348 --> 03:37.350
my date for Saturday night
called to cancel

03:37.350 --> 03:38.651
because I am not her type.

03:38.651 --> 03:39.652
Oh, and guess what?

03:39.652 --> 03:41.916
Her honesty was not refreshing.

03:45.391 --> 03:46.483
Dear God...

03:46.793 --> 03:49.362
we're out of sherry.

03:49.362 --> 03:52.865
Well... insult...

03:52.865 --> 03:54.264
made injury.

03:54.534 --> 03:57.867
Well, here's something
that'll cheer you up.

03:58.304 --> 04:00.373
Ronee's boss gave her
his cabin for the weekend,

04:00.373 --> 04:02.675
so we're heading
up there tonight.

04:02.675 --> 04:05.678
Oh. Well...

04:05.678 --> 04:07.380
being home alone
for the weekend

04:07.380 --> 04:09.382
might be just the thing
for someone in my state
of mind.

04:09.382 --> 04:10.383
Me...

04:10.383 --> 04:13.653
and my shadow of a life.

04:13.653 --> 04:15.421
Hey, hey, hey!

04:15.421 --> 04:17.724
We're not leaving you at home.
You're coming with us.

04:17.724 --> 04:19.315
Wouldn't be any fun
without you.

04:19.425 --> 04:20.983
Oh, really, Dad?

04:21.293 --> 04:23.830
I was so hoping
that you would say that.

04:23.830 --> 04:24.897
The last thing I wanted to do

04:24.897 --> 04:26.899
was spend the weekend here
wallowing in self-pity.

04:26.899 --> 04:28.890
Leave it to you
to see right through me

04:29.402 --> 04:31.632
and toss me a lifeline.

04:31.938 --> 04:33.496
Oh, uh, now,
are you sure, Fras?

04:33.973 --> 04:35.475
'Cause, you know, uh,
come to think of it,

04:35.475 --> 04:37.410
there are lots of
squirrels up there.

04:37.410 --> 04:38.778
(doorbell rings)

04:38.778 --> 04:41.269
Well, I don't mind them
in their own milieu.

04:41.781 --> 04:43.783
Oh, guys,
I'm so looking forward

04:43.783 --> 04:45.285
to taking in some mountain air
with the two of you.

04:45.285 --> 04:47.287
And isn't this fortuitous?

04:47.287 --> 04:49.983
I've just had
my Tyrolean hat refeathered!

04:50.456 --> 04:52.287
Can I talk to you?

04:52.358 --> 04:53.950
(door opens)
FRASIER:
Niles.

04:54.427 --> 04:56.918
Oh, Frasier, I have had...

04:57.430 --> 04:58.931
the worst day imaginable.

04:58.931 --> 05:00.433
I need a sherry.

05:00.433 --> 05:01.661
Brace yourself.

05:05.505 --> 05:07.496
You always think it's going
to happen to someone else.

05:11.511 --> 05:13.513
I've opened some wine, Niles
. Help yourself.

05:13.513 --> 05:15.003
Oh, thanks.

05:15.448 --> 05:17.483
Two of my patients canceled,

05:17.483 --> 05:19.986
and Daphne and I spent
the afternoon arguing

05:19.986 --> 05:21.977
over which diaper pail
we would buy for the nursery.

05:22.488 --> 05:23.750
Then, driving home,

05:23.990 --> 05:26.025
I successfully avoided
hitting a squirrel,

05:26.025 --> 05:29.517
only to be nearly run off the
road by some horn-happy maniac.

05:33.933 --> 05:35.924
That was me, you simp.
You nearly killed me.

05:38.504 --> 05:40.039
You nearly killed me!

05:40.039 --> 05:42.507
And what was that crude
multipart gesture

05:42.975 --> 05:44.465
you unleashed on me?

05:44.977 --> 05:47.468
I had hot coffee
all over my hand!

05:50.550 --> 05:52.618
You know what?
I do not wish to delve into it.

05:52.618 --> 05:56.122
I am trying to put my own
miserable day behind me.

05:56.122 --> 05:58.613
To that end, Ronee and Dad

05:59.125 --> 06:00.615
are going to the mountains
for the weekend

06:01.127 --> 06:02.116
and I've decided
to tag along.

06:02.395 --> 06:04.497
Ah.

06:04.497 --> 06:06.999
So it'll be
just two wheels and you.

06:06.999 --> 06:09.035
What are you saying?

06:09.035 --> 06:11.936
Well, just that if Ronee
and Dad are going away
for the weekend,

06:12.405 --> 06:14.407
it might've been more
considerate not to horn in.

06:14.407 --> 06:16.409
I'm not horning in,
they invited me.

06:16.409 --> 06:18.511
Ah, well, I would
never dream of accepting

06:18.511 --> 06:19.808
such an obvious pity invite.

06:22.448 --> 06:24.575
.
You don't have to dream,
because they didn't invite you

06:28.888 --> 06:30.923
It happened so fast,
then he got all excited

06:30.923 --> 06:32.425
and I didn't know
what to say.

06:32.425 --> 06:35.428
How about,
"I was talking to the dog"?

06:35.428 --> 06:37.919
You know, the poor guy's going
through a bad patch right now.

06:38.431 --> 06:39.420
He could use a little company.

06:39.932 --> 06:42.799
We don't have to spend
any time with him.

06:43.069 --> 06:44.161
Marty, you know I love Frasier,

06:44.604 --> 06:46.094
but this was supposed
to be our weekend.

06:46.606 --> 06:47.095
You and me, alone.

06:47.607 --> 06:48.972
I know.

06:49.242 --> 06:50.834
But, hey,
why stop at Frasier?

06:51.477 --> 06:53.780
Why not invite Niles and Daphne
and make it a party?

06:53.780 --> 06:55.771
We'd love to!

06:57.483 --> 07:00.486
Thank you, Ronee!
Thanks, Dad!

07:00.486 --> 07:01.783
(taunting tone):
Frasier...

07:08.895 --> 07:09.862
MARTIN: Morning!

07:10.196 --> 07:11.631
You're finally up.
How'd you sleep?

07:11.631 --> 07:12.632
Perfectly.

07:12.632 --> 07:15.134
I was borne off to dreamland

07:15.134 --> 07:17.136
by the cooing
of a mourning dove.

07:17.136 --> 07:18.638
Oh, I heard that, too.

07:18.638 --> 07:20.128
I think the weasel
s are in heat.

07:20.640 --> 07:21.629
MARTIN:
Ronee and I are taking

07:22.108 --> 07:23.643
a walk down to the lake.

07:23.643 --> 07:24.644
Anybody interested?

07:24.644 --> 07:25.633
Oh, no, thanks, Pa.

07:25.945 --> 07:28.778
I'm fixin' to have me
some vittles.

07:29.148 --> 07:31.684
Is he going to talk
hillbilly all weekend?

07:31.684 --> 07:33.686
You should've heard him
the weekend of the
Renaissance Faire.

07:33.686 --> 07:35.688
FRASIER:
See you guys later!

07:35.688 --> 07:36.677
Okay, bye.
All right.

07:37.089 --> 07:40.126
Aw, Daph...

07:40.126 --> 07:42.617
you know who would've
really enjoyed this trip?

07:43.129 --> 07:44.530
Niles.

07:44.530 --> 07:45.519
You're right.

07:46.032 --> 07:47.033
But let's not dwell on that.

07:47.033 --> 07:48.534
.
We'll make our own fun

07:48.534 --> 07:50.036
Right.

07:50.036 --> 07:52.038
Something smells good.
Whatcha cookin'?

07:52.038 --> 07:53.039
Sausage patties.

07:53.039 --> 07:55.041
Oh! I hope they're
hot and spicy.

07:55.041 --> 07:56.542
That's the way
I like it.

07:56.542 --> 07:57.543
I know you do.

07:57.543 --> 07:59.045
(both laughing)

07:59.045 --> 08:00.535
You're so different from your brother.

08:01.047 --> 08:01.911
Really? How so?

08:02.281 --> 08:04.517
Well, for one thing,
you're alive.

08:04.517 --> 08:09.522
(both laughing)

08:09.522 --> 08:11.824
You know, I can't believe
there are still people

08:11.824 --> 08:13.826
who blame me
for Niles's death.

08:13.826 --> 08:15.828
Oh, people will talk
about anything.

08:15.828 --> 08:18.531
So you sliced him to ribbons
with your wheat thresher.

08:18.531 --> 08:20.556
It was your first time farming,
for God sakes.

08:22.568 --> 08:24.570
What did I do
with the salt?

08:24.570 --> 08:25.559
Hmm...

08:26.873 --> 08:28.140
Huh...

08:28.140 --> 08:30.734
Maybe I left it
in the dining room.

08:34.981 --> 08:36.716
Oh, I forgot to mention...

08:36.716 --> 08:37.705
What's that, dear?

08:39.018 --> 08:40.712
I just had your baby.

08:43.990 --> 08:47.892
I have never seen
anything more beautifuI in my entire life.

08:49.000 --> 08:55.074

08:56.569 --> 08:57.797
(gasps)

09:05.845 --> 09:08.347
Frasier? I thought
you went to bed.

09:08.347 --> 09:11.817
I had a rather bizarre dream.

09:11.817 --> 09:13.686
Really? What about?

09:13.686 --> 09:14.584
Uh...

09:17.023 --> 09:18.718
Well, I'm not sure you
really want to hear

09:19.025 --> 09:20.026
about this one, Niles.

09:20.026 --> 09:22.028
Well, clearly it troubled you.

09:22.028 --> 09:24.030
It might help you
to discuss it.

09:24.030 --> 09:26.566
You know how I enjoy
interpreting dreams.

09:26.566 --> 09:30.670
Well, all right, uh...

09:30.670 --> 09:33.833
(clears throat)

09:34.340 --> 09:35.841
It took place in
this very kitchen,

09:35.841 --> 09:38.844
and, uh...

09:38.844 --> 09:40.346
I was married to Daphne

09:40.346 --> 09:42.337
and we were expecting
a baby and, uh...

09:45.351 --> 09:47.342
...you were dead
and I killed you.

09:52.858 --> 09:55.261
Well, I can see how
that might disturb you.

09:55.261 --> 09:57.730
Indeed.

09:57.730 --> 10:00.096
A man of your intellect
having such an obvious dream.

10:00.600 --> 10:02.335
I beg your pardon.

10:02.335 --> 10:04.270
Oh, come on.

10:04.270 --> 10:06.272
You're lonely,
and you envy what I have.

10:06.272 --> 10:08.774
I was just hoping
for something more complex.

10:08.774 --> 10:10.776
You know, a staircase
leading nowhere

10:10.776 --> 10:12.744
or Mom giving you
a physical.

10:16.015 --> 10:18.718
Well, there were many other
perplexing details

10:18.718 --> 10:20.379
that I left out.

10:20.886 --> 10:21.887
For instance,

10:21.887 --> 10:25.224
uh, well, there was, uh...

10:25.224 --> 10:27.026
a wheat thresher,

10:27.026 --> 10:29.762
and some

10:29.762 --> 10:30.751
sausage patties.

10:34.000 --> 10:35.735
And Eddie was dead, too.

10:35.735 --> 10:37.965
Ah, well, there's
a real head-scratcher.

10:41.641 --> 10:44.644
Well, thank you for your
exhaustive analysis, Dr. Crane.

10:44.644 --> 10:47.647
Perhaps you should relocate
your offices to a drive-thru

10:47.647 --> 10:49.649
so your patients could speak
into a clown's nose.

10:49.649 --> 10:51.951
w.
All right, I'm going to bed no

10:51.951 --> 10:53.942
I was hoping this book
would make me drowsy,

10:54.654 --> 10:57.657
but it looks like your dream
has done the trick instead.

10:57.657 --> 11:01.058
You died tragically,
and no one missed you.

11:05.331 --> 11:06.832
Oh, hi, Roz.

11:06.832 --> 11:08.834
Well, finally.
Your show's about to start.

11:08.834 --> 11:10.336
I'm sorry.

11:10.336 --> 11:12.338
We just got back
from the mountains
this morning.

11:12.338 --> 11:14.340
You're about to
get all the vacation
you can handle.

11:14.340 --> 11:16.242
kenny says if you don't get a call today,
you're off the air.

11:16.242 --> 11:17.677
What?! We're bound
to get a call.

11:17.677 --> 11:20.669
Why? We haven't had
a call in six months.

11:21.881 --> 11:23.749
Oh, dear.

11:23.749 --> 11:25.251
(gasps)
You're on!

11:25.251 --> 11:26.752
What?

11:26.752 --> 11:27.753
Hello, Seattle.

11:27.753 --> 11:29.778
This is Dr. Frasier Crane.

11:30.056 --> 11:31.757
Who's our first caller, Roz?

11:31.757 --> 11:33.918
We have no one
from nowhere.

11:34.326 --> 11:35.258
Very amusing, Roz.

11:35.828 --> 11:37.261
(phone ringing)

11:37.763 --> 11:38.764
What's that sound?

11:38.764 --> 11:40.266
hone.
It's a p

11:40.266 --> 11:41.267
Go get it!

11:41.267 --> 11:43.269
Hurry!

11:43.269 --> 11:44.770
Hello.

11:44.770 --> 11:46.260
Hello, Seattle.
I'm listening.

11:46.772 --> 11:47.773
Not that one.
The black one.

11:47.773 --> 11:49.275
Hello, Seattle.
I'm listening.

11:49.275 --> 11:50.276
Right there.

11:50.276 --> 11:51.777
Hello, hello, Seattle...

11:51.777 --> 11:52.778
Hurry! They're going to hang up!

11:52.778 --> 11:54.113
Hello... hello...

11:54.113 --> 11:55.876
If you don't find that phone

11:56.115 --> 11:58.117
I'm driving this booth
off a cliff.

11:58.117 --> 12:01.109
(sobbing):
Oh, God, I'm trying
to listen...!

12:04.056 --> 12:05.057
(gasps)

12:05.057 --> 12:07.116
Damn it.

12:13.999 --> 12:15.768
DAPHNE:
Niles, how's the baby?

12:15.768 --> 12:17.429
Have you fed
the baby yet?

12:19.438 --> 12:21.941
Make sure you warm
the bottle first,

12:21.941 --> 12:23.375
but not too hot.

12:23.375 --> 12:24.307
Should I come up?

12:27.480 --> 12:28.481
(explosion)

12:28.481 --> 12:29.482
What was that?

12:29.482 --> 12:31.484
Is everything
all right up there?

12:31.484 --> 12:32.985
I'm coming to check.

12:32.985 --> 12:34.475
Don't forget to burp him.

12:34.987 --> 12:36.489
If you don't burp him,
he'll cry.

12:36.489 --> 12:38.491
I better do it myself.
Here I come.

12:38.491 --> 12:40.392
DAPHNE:
Is the baby okay?

12:40.392 --> 12:42.795
What's going on?
I'm on my way.

12:42.795 --> 12:44.160
(loud buzzing)

12:49.935 --> 12:53.339
He's going to need
a new nappy, too.

12:53.339 --> 12:56.934
Don't forget your other
responsibilities, Niles.

12:57.176 --> 12:59.838
There's lots of other
responsibilities.

12:59.945 --> 13:02.914
You have to prioritize,
and the baby comes first.

13:03.249 --> 13:05.342
Is he all right?

13:05.951 --> 13:07.213
I'm coming up there.

13:09.522 --> 13:11.387
Make sure you support his head
when you hold him.

13:11.891 --> 13:14.960
Are you doing it right?
I'm coming to check.

13:14.960 --> 13:17.863
Are you ignoring me?
Why don't I hear anything?

13:17.863 --> 13:20.161
Do I have to do
everything around here?

13:27.173 --> 13:29.869
Do I smell
something burning?

13:30.176 --> 13:31.040
I'm on my way.

13:31.510 --> 13:33.034
(electricity popping)

13:41.987 --> 13:43.189
What was that?

13:43.189 --> 13:45.191
I'd better not find a mess.

13:45.191 --> 13:47.326
I have enough work
taking care of the baby.

13:47.326 --> 13:49.226
I can't clean up after you, too.

13:50.529 --> 13:52.121
Is everything
all right in there?

13:56.569 --> 13:58.434
(gasping)

13:58.704 --> 14:00.906
I can't do it.

14:00.906 --> 14:03.101
It's just as well.
I'm too tired, anyway.

14:08.013 --> 14:09.348
Oh, you couldn'?
sleep either?

14:09.348 --> 14:12.985
Just thought I'd fix
myself a little snack.

14:12.985 --> 14:15.954
Well, you're entitled,
eating for two.

14:16.255 --> 14:18.883
I had the baby
five months ago.

14:20.860 --> 14:23.996
Oh, yes, that's right.
I had Roz send you some flowers.

14:23.996 --> 14:25.397
I just have a few extra
pregnancy pounds

14:25.397 --> 14:26.955
I haven't been able to lose yet.

14:29.969 --> 14:31.334
It's really starting to show.

14:32.037 --> 14:33.038
Oh, yes.

14:33.038 --> 14:34.373
Well done.

14:34.373 --> 14:37.069
I'll have Roz
send you some flowers.

14:38.043 --> 14:39.340
Excuse us.

14:41.046 --> 14:45.244
The plumber has to fix
the leaky faucet in our bedroom.

14:45.618 --> 14:47.210
Oh, sure, go right on up.

14:52.124 --> 14:53.626
one,
Isn't he a clever

14:53.626 --> 14:55.617
finding a plumber
at this hour?

14:56.061 --> 14:57.050
Yes, indeed.

14:57.463 --> 14:59.055
How fat of you to notice.

15:01.901 --> 15:03.235
Hello.

15:03.235 --> 15:04.634
Hi. I'm here about
the cable problem.

15:05.004 --> 15:06.405
Oh, I don't know anything about that.

15:06.405 --> 15:08.396
I'll handle this,
darling.

15:09.074 --> 15:11.076
Cable's out
in the bedroom.

15:11.076 --> 15:13.374
Well, let's see what you've
going on in there.

15:19.084 --> 15:22.247
Bless him. He's on top
of everything around here.

15:22.655 --> 15:26.558
You know, I really miss
playing with Niles.

15:26.558 --> 15:29.083
But he's so busy sleeping with other women.

15:29.261 --> 15:31.320
What did you say?

15:32.231 --> 15:33.095
Have you seen Dad?

15:33.365 --> 15:35.424
Do you still think
I'm beautiful?

15:37.469 --> 15:38.470
Dad, there you are.

15:38.470 --> 15:40.461
I need to show you something
in the bedroom.

15:40.973 --> 15:43.475
Niles, wait!

15:43.475 --> 15:47.479
Please tell me you think
I'm beautiful!

15:47.479 --> 15:49.970
Niles, answer me!

15:52.451 --> 15:54.119
Niles!

15:54.119 --> 15:55.087
Are you all right?

15:55.087 --> 15:57.790
How could you?!

15:57.790 --> 15:59.124
I'm sorry?

15:59.124 --> 16:00.614
You better be!

16:11.437 --> 16:13.105
Hello.

16:13.105 --> 16:14.106
Oh, hi, Daph.

16:14.106 --> 16:16.404
What are you doing here?

16:17.109 --> 16:19.100
I had a nightmare.
Couldn't get back to sleep.

16:19.445 --> 16:20.446
.
That's strange

16:20.446 --> 16:22.114
Niles had a nightmare, too,

16:22.114 --> 16:23.449
and I just dreamt...

16:23.449 --> 16:25.451
Niles had a nightmare?

16:25.451 --> 16:27.119
Mm-hmm.
What about?

16:27.119 --> 16:29.110
He dropped the baby,
and it shattered.

16:29.455 --> 16:30.456
(chuckles)

16:30.456 --> 16:31.445
That's perfect.

16:32.992 --> 16:34.326
Wait a minute.

16:34.326 --> 16:35.995
How did he drop it?

16:35.995 --> 16:37.292
Was it from a height?
In a crowd?

16:37.997 --> 16:38.986
Was there water involved?

16:39.164 --> 16:40.799
No, he was in the nursery.

16:40.799 --> 16:42.801
Yes!

16:42.801 --> 16:45.304
Oh, hi, Niles.

16:45.304 --> 16:47.169
I understand
you had a bad dream.

16:47.506 --> 16:48.302
(chuckles)

16:48.407 --> 16:51.076
Yes, it was utterly
inscrutable.

16:51.076 --> 16:54.079
There was a table saw
and an apple pie...

16:54.079 --> 16:57.016
Spare me, Niles.
You broke the baby.

16:57.016 --> 16:59.184
Now who has
the obvious dreams?

16:59.184 --> 17:01.186
It was still more interesting
than yours.

17:01.186 --> 17:03.051
Frasier dreamed he killed me
and married you.

17:03.188 --> 17:05.824
At least he wasn't cheating
on me with the service people

17:05.824 --> 17:06.813
because I was fat!

17:09.094 --> 17:11.030
Will you please stop blaming me

17:11.030 --> 17:12.327
for something I did
in your dreams.

17:12.731 --> 17:14.323
So you admit it.

17:16.769 --> 17:20.227
Daphne, Daphne, I will always
find you attractive.

17:20.406 --> 17:22.207
Your dreams shouldn't
worry you at all.

17:22.207 --> 17:24.542
Unlike mine. I could very well
turn out to be a bad father.

17:24.542 --> 17:27.179
At least you two
can face your fears together.

17:27.179 --> 17:31.377
Whom do I have to hug away
my night terrors, hmm?

17:31.583 --> 17:34.219
Oh, boo-hoo.
Send yourself some flowers.

17:34.219 --> 17:35.721
I beg your pardon.

17:35.721 --> 17:37.556
That's a rather
flippant comeback

17:37.556 --> 17:39.158
when I express myself...

17:39.158 --> 17:41.126
Don't you take that tone
with my wife.

17:41.126 --> 17:42.594
He finally notices
I'm in the room.

17:42.594 --> 17:45.264
(all arguing)

17:45.264 --> 17:48.600
MARTIN:
What the hell is going on here?

17:48.600 --> 17:51.136
Well, Dad, it's this
infernal mountain air.

17:51.136 --> 17:52.404
It's giving us all nightmares.

17:52.404 --> 17:53.439
All of you?

17:53.439 --> 17:54.873
Well...

17:54.873 --> 17:56.773
Daphne dreamed
that she was terminally fat,

17:57.109 --> 18:00.245
Niles that he was going
to be a bad parent...

18:00.245 --> 18:02.748
At least mine arose
from a real problem:

18:02.748 --> 18:04.739
the fact that I'm alone
and I will always be alone.

18:05.250 --> 18:06.251
Geez, we come up here
to relax,

18:06.251 --> 18:08.220
and you're arguing
about your dreams?

18:08.220 --> 18:10.745
Dreams that reveal
genuine anxieties which were...

18:11.290 --> 18:12.291
Blah, blah, blah.

18:12.291 --> 18:13.280
You're going to lose your looks?

18:13.792 --> 18:14.793
Happens to everyone.

18:14.793 --> 18:15.782
You're afraid you're going to end up alone?

18:16.295 --> 18:17.296
You'll still have your family.

18:17.296 --> 18:19.465
You're afraid you're
going to be a bad father?

18:19.465 --> 18:21.160
Join the club.

18:21.467 --> 18:23.332
Now just clam up
and go to bed.

18:26.672 --> 18:30.199
You know, I'm starting to regrinviting
him up here.

18:37.649 --> 18:40.319
Dad, we're sorry.

18:40.319 --> 18:41.653
NILES:
You were right.

18:41.653 --> 18:43.655
Maybe we let our problems
get to us a bit too much.

18:43.655 --> 18:45.324
MARTIN:
Well, hell, yes.

18:45.324 --> 18:47.884
.
If they're the worst
of your problems, you're lucky

18:48.460 --> 18:49.928
I got a bullet in my hip,

18:49.928 --> 18:51.430
a girlfriend
who's too good for me

18:51.430 --> 18:52.831
and might realize it any day,

18:52.831 --> 18:55.300
a dog who's pushing
80 in human years

18:55.300 --> 18:56.802
and I'm not far behind him--

18:56.802 --> 18:59.338
but you don't hear me
making a fuss, do you?

18:59.338 --> 19:00.472
know why?

19:00.472 --> 19:03.308
'Cause I focus on
what's good about my life.

19:03.308 --> 19:05.477
You know what
you people should do?

19:05.477 --> 19:07.172
Let's tell them, Ronee.

19:08.947 --> 19:11.383
(playing lively piano intro)

19:11.383 --> 19:15.454
Grab your coat
and get your hat??

19:15.454 --> 19:18.446
Leave your worries
on the doorstep??

19:18.957 --> 19:21.949
Life can be so sweet??

19:22.461 --> 19:25.464
On the sunny side
of the street...??

19:25.464 --> 19:29.958
(lush orchestration begins)

19:44.316 --> 19:48.754
Can't you hear
the pitter-pat??

19:48.754 --> 19:52.424
And that happy tune
is your step??

19:52.424 --> 19:55.928
Life can be complete??

19:55.928 --> 19:58.920
On the sunny side
of the street??

19:59.431 --> 20:02.400
MARTIN AND RONEE:
I used to walk in the shade?

20:02.467 --> 20:06.301
With my blues on parade?

20:06.538 --> 20:10.201
But I'm not afraid??

20:10.442 --> 20:14.674
This rover crossed over?

20:14.880 --> 20:18.050
If I never have a cent

20:18.050 --> 20:21.918
I'll be rich as Rockefeller

20:22.221 --> 20:25.524
Gold dust at my feet??

20:26.305 --> 20:32.837
