WEBVTT

00:03.045 --> 00:04.505
- How are the eggs?
- Good.

00:04.588 --> 00:05.881
I'm glad.

00:08.842 --> 00:10.385
- They're still good.
- I'm still glad.

00:10.469 --> 00:12.638
- Freak, we'll not be late.
- It's the first day.

00:12.721 --> 00:15.140
- I want to get there early.
- We will. I promise.

00:15.182 --> 00:18.018
I have different classes this year.
My routes aren't the same.

00:18.101 --> 00:21.355
I haven't found the quickest path around.
And they moved my locker.

00:21.438 --> 00:24.107
If it doesn't work properly
I'll have to get a new one.

00:24.191 --> 00:26.568
God knows how long that'll take
and where it'll be.

00:26.652 --> 00:29.071
That could send the whole day into chaos.

00:29.154 --> 00:30.656
I'm just excited.

00:30.739 --> 00:33.242
- Thank God, you haven't left yet.
- No, what's up?

00:33.325 --> 00:35.369
I found the greatest record store
in the world.

00:35.452 --> 00:38.080
It's 10 minutes from your school.
How much do you love me?

00:38.163 --> 00:39.122
Address?

00:39.206 --> 00:43.168
Record Breaker Incorporated,
2453 Berlin Turnpike.

00:43.669 --> 00:47.381
- Got it. Place your order now.
- Yes. Okay.

00:47.548 --> 00:50.551
Charles Mingus,
The Black Saint And The Sinner Lady.

00:50.884 --> 00:53.220
- The Sonics, Here Are the Sonics.
- Burn me a copy.

00:53.303 --> 00:55.931
- Next.
- MC5, Kick Out The Jams.

00:56.014 --> 00:58.475
Fairport Convention, Liege & Lief.
Bee Gees, Odessa.

00:58.559 --> 00:59.560
Really?

00:59.643 --> 01:01.854
- Mojo says.
- So it must be true.

01:01.895 --> 01:02.980
That's it.

01:03.063 --> 01:06.441
If I could find a copy of
Whistler, Chaucer, Detroit and Greenhill...

01:06.525 --> 01:08.402
I will finally be done with the '60s.

01:08.485 --> 01:10.529
I can get there today.
Tomorrow at the latest.

01:10.612 --> 01:13.115
- I love it when you go back to school.
- Me, too.

01:13.198 --> 01:16.910
I am getting doughnuts for later.
As soon as I do, I'll take you to school...

01:16.994 --> 01:19.121
and nice men in white coats
will pick you up.

01:19.204 --> 01:20.205
Everybody, listen up:

01:20.289 --> 01:23.834
Decide what you want, place your order,
proceed to the end of the line.

01:23.917 --> 01:25.669
- I want a burger.
- I want grilled cheese.

01:25.752 --> 01:28.046
And I want fries.
And make them really crispy.

01:28.130 --> 01:31.049
- I want mine crispy, too.
- You didn't order fries.

01:31.091 --> 01:33.969
You can't order crispy fries
without first ordering fries.

01:34.052 --> 01:35.053
Why not?

01:35.137 --> 01:37.556
You can't make something crispy
that doesn't exist.

01:37.639 --> 01:39.391
- Why not?
- Get him away from me.

01:39.474 --> 01:40.517
Have some respect.

01:40.601 --> 01:45.230
These boys just completed the first leg
of their outdoor-survival training.

01:45.314 --> 01:48.358
Meaning you had them sit under a tree
and glue rocks together.

01:48.442 --> 01:51.320
You're a very jaded man.
What happened to you as a child?

01:51.403 --> 01:54.656
A creepy guy in shorts and knee socks
tried to sit me under a tree...

01:54.740 --> 01:56.074
and glue rocks together.

01:56.116 --> 01:57.284
- Put that down.
- Why?

01:57.367 --> 01:59.703
- Otherwise you're going under it.
- I won't fit.

01:59.786 --> 02:01.496
- Yes, you will.
- Doughnuts, please.

02:01.580 --> 02:03.999
- We were here first!
- On the planet?

02:04.541 --> 02:07.085
You lose.
Chocolate cinnamon and sprinkles.

02:08.461 --> 02:10.088
Pipe down!

02:10.464 --> 02:11.507
Grumps, huh?

02:11.590 --> 02:14.092
Yeah, I'm working.
What do you think I'm doing?

02:15.344 --> 02:17.387
Man. What did you do?

02:17.971 --> 02:20.140
Excuse me? Are you serious?

02:20.974 --> 02:23.894
Mr. Doose, she's not supposed to do that.

02:24.311 --> 02:26.480
That's right. She's breaking the rules...

02:26.563 --> 02:28.565
and people who break the rules...

02:28.649 --> 02:33.070
end up very lonely with no friends
because they become society's outcasts.

02:33.153 --> 02:35.572
Planning on burning
a little Huck Finn after lunch?

02:35.656 --> 02:37.783
- Excuse me?
- This is unbelievable!

02:37.824 --> 02:40.160
You will never change, will you?

02:41.161 --> 02:42.538
Okay, fine.

02:42.746 --> 02:44.498
Do what you want,
make the arrangements.

02:44.581 --> 02:47.417
Now, I'm working. We'll finish this later.

02:48.669 --> 02:51.380
- Is everything okay?
- Do you have a sister?

02:51.463 --> 02:52.840
- No.
- I do.

02:52.923 --> 02:56.134
- You have my sympathies.
- Thanks. I appreciate that.

02:58.000 --> 03:04.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:59.031 --> 04:00.240
- Hey.
- Hello.

04:00.324 --> 04:03.327
- What are you doing?
- Just redecorating the sidewalk.

04:03.410 --> 04:05.913
- Looks nice.
- You don't think too much blue?

04:05.996 --> 04:09.374
- No, just enough.
- Thanks for the input. You can go now.

04:09.458 --> 04:11.043
- Need some help?
- Nope.

04:14.880 --> 04:16.507
Do you need some help?

04:17.966 --> 04:20.594
Since when do you buy Frosted Flakes?

04:22.596 --> 04:25.390
- Okay, now, what is going on?
- Nothing.

04:25.432 --> 04:28.101
Nothing? You just woke up this morning...

04:28.185 --> 04:30.479
and decided to buy every food item
in the world...

04:30.562 --> 04:32.773
- that you don't actually eat?
- It's not for me.

04:32.856 --> 04:35.484
- Who is it for?
- Someone who's not me.

04:37.110 --> 04:38.946
- Like who?
- Like my nephew.

04:39.029 --> 04:42.491
- Your nephew's coming to visit.
- No, he's coming to stay.

04:42.574 --> 04:44.910
- Your sister's moving here?
- No.

04:45.035 --> 04:49.081
- I'm sorry, I don't get it.
- There's nothing to get. She's just Liz.

04:49.164 --> 04:52.084
She's busy, she can't handle him,
she's sending him here.

04:52.167 --> 04:53.585
Where's his dad?

04:53.669 --> 04:57.256
The great prize that my sister picked up
at a Der Wienerschnitzel...

04:57.339 --> 05:00.092
left her about two years ago,
whereabouts unknown.

05:02.302 --> 05:04.596
So she's sending him here, just like that?

05:04.680 --> 05:08.225
No, I'm sure she put at least
five or six minutes of thought into it.

05:08.308 --> 05:09.768
But why?

05:10.060 --> 05:11.937
He's been getting into some trouble...

05:11.979 --> 05:14.398
and Liz is afraid
he's heading for something bad...

05:14.481 --> 05:17.609
and rather than handle it herself,
she's given up.

05:17.651 --> 05:20.946
She's sending him here
so I can straighten him out.

05:20.988 --> 05:22.447
- You?
- Yes.

05:22.531 --> 05:24.408
- You can straighten him out?
- Yes.

05:24.491 --> 05:27.703
Luke, the great communicator,
you're going to straighten the kid out?

05:27.786 --> 05:30.747
All he needs is a change of pace,
a new crowd...

05:30.831 --> 05:33.542
and to get away from the nut job...

05:33.625 --> 05:36.628
that unfortunately is my sister.

05:36.712 --> 05:39.923
- How long is he staying?
- I don't know. Indefinitely.

05:40.007 --> 05:41.967
- How old is he?
- Seventeen.

05:43.635 --> 05:45.929
That is very generous of you.

05:46.013 --> 05:48.307
- It's family. What else can you do?
- Right.

05:48.390 --> 05:51.643
- What kind of trouble has he gotten into?
- Just kid stuff.

05:51.685 --> 05:55.314
You know, staying out late, getting rowdy.

05:56.523 --> 05:59.902
- I don't know exactly.
- You might want to find out.

05:59.985 --> 06:03.322
Ask a couple of subtle questions.
Has he seen The Shawshank Redemption?

06:03.405 --> 06:05.782
Did the setting seem homey to him?
Stuff like that.

06:05.824 --> 06:08.535
His problem is obvious. It's his mother.

06:08.619 --> 06:11.246
We never could count on Liz for anything.

06:11.330 --> 06:15.667
Our mom died when we were kids, right?
It was just my dad, me, and Liz.

06:16.126 --> 06:19.755
My dad worked all the time
and I worked in the store with my dad...

06:19.838 --> 06:22.549
and Liz was off doing God knows what.

06:22.633 --> 06:24.843
I bet losing her mom so early
was hard on her.

06:24.927 --> 06:27.179
It was hard on all of us
but we did our part.

06:27.221 --> 06:30.390
And the minute she graduates high school,
she is out of here.

06:30.474 --> 06:34.228
Didn't matter that my dad was sick.
Didn't matter that the store was failing.

06:34.311 --> 06:37.898
She just took off. Married
the hot dog king, had a kid, he left.

06:37.981 --> 06:39.107
Now here we are.

06:39.191 --> 06:42.986
- Yeah. I'm sorry, what are you doing?
- I'm blowing this up.

06:43.070 --> 06:44.404
- What is it?
- It's a bed.

06:44.488 --> 06:45.739
- A bed?
- For Jess.

06:45.822 --> 06:47.115
- Jess?
- My nephew.

06:47.199 --> 06:49.076
That's not a bed, that's a raft.

06:49.159 --> 06:51.453
It's fine if you'll build a moat
around the diner...

06:51.537 --> 06:53.372
- It's fine.
- The kid needs a bed.

06:53.413 --> 06:56.250
If you want to get him
something inflatable, make it a blonde.

06:56.333 --> 06:58.627
I'm getting him a bed.
This is just temporary.

06:58.710 --> 07:01.839
- How does Jess feel about this?
- I don't know.

07:01.880 --> 07:04.007
- You haven't talked to him about it?
- No.

07:04.091 --> 07:06.885
- Don't you think you should?
- Why? He doesn't have a choice.

07:06.969 --> 07:09.638
His mom's a flake, he's coming here.
End of story.

07:09.721 --> 07:11.932
- Are you sure you're ready for this?
- Of course.

07:12.015 --> 07:14.935
Taking on a full-time kid,
that's a lot of work.

07:15.018 --> 07:16.019
I know.

07:16.103 --> 07:19.189
A 17-year-old who's been in trouble
and is being shipped off...

07:19.273 --> 07:21.149
without his consent, that could be harder.

07:21.233 --> 07:24.653
All he needs is to be around someone
who's not a selfish basket case...

07:24.736 --> 07:27.739
who will give him a little space,
who will treat him like a man.

07:27.823 --> 07:30.659
- You should think about this.
- There's nothing to think about.

07:30.742 --> 07:32.202
You take care of family. Period.

07:32.286 --> 07:34.663
I respect that.
But what if he turns out to be Fredo?

07:34.746 --> 07:38.333
- Are you telling me not to do this?
- No, I'm not.

07:38.417 --> 07:39.585
Then what are you saying?

07:39.626 --> 07:43.213
I'm just saying
that if you need any help, I'm here.

07:43.630 --> 07:45.090
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

07:45.132 --> 07:47.467
I got a lot of things to do
before he gets here.

07:47.551 --> 07:49.261
Okay, I'm leaving.

07:52.222 --> 07:55.934
- You do have an extra set of sheets, right?
- Yes, I do.

07:56.018 --> 07:58.103
Sorry. Just checking. Bye.

08:03.609 --> 08:05.194
Sheets.

08:17.414 --> 08:18.999
Okay, round two.

08:20.792 --> 08:22.044
- Five seconds?
- Four.

08:22.127 --> 08:23.253
- Fine.
- Now it's three.

08:23.337 --> 08:25.797
- Paris, it does not have to be like this.
- No?

08:25.839 --> 08:29.218
You and I are going to spend
a lot of time together on the Franklin.

08:29.301 --> 08:30.302
I know.

08:30.385 --> 08:33.514
We're going to sit in the same classroom,
share the same oxygen.

08:33.597 --> 08:36.433
- Occasionally make eye contact.
- I can avoid that.

08:36.517 --> 08:39.227
I'm not saying that we should be friends.
I don't want that.

08:39.311 --> 08:42.773
I'm just saying
that we should look at this like life.

08:42.856 --> 08:44.775
- Life?
- Yes, in life...

08:44.858 --> 08:47.986
there will be people you don't like
but you have to coexist with.

08:48.070 --> 08:51.490
- I'm well aware of that.
- So I'm just suggesting that we coexist.

08:51.532 --> 08:54.535
You're scared I'll make your life
on the Franklin a living hell.

08:54.618 --> 08:56.745
Especially since I'm the editor
and you're...

08:56.828 --> 08:59.081
What's the word? Not.

08:59.164 --> 09:02.835
If you want to spend the precious energy
that you would spend on the paper...

09:02.918 --> 09:05.587
obsessing on making me miserable,
then that's your choice.

09:05.671 --> 09:07.881
I'm just suggesting an alternate plan.

09:07.965 --> 09:11.051
- The paper could be really great this year.
- I know.

09:11.134 --> 09:14.096
So can't we agree on that
and make the rest of it go away?

09:14.179 --> 09:15.556
Everything okay?

09:15.639 --> 09:18.642
Yeah, everything's fine.
We were just talking.

09:18.725 --> 09:21.186
- Talking? You two?
- About the Franklin.

09:22.563 --> 09:24.523
Nope, still seems weird.

09:25.107 --> 09:26.692
We're all on the paper together.

09:26.775 --> 09:29.736
There's going to be a lot of
long afternoons and weekends.

09:29.820 --> 09:32.823
- We need to coexist. Right?
- Right.

09:32.906 --> 09:35.033
I'm sorry, back up to the weekends.

09:35.117 --> 09:38.871
So that's what we'll do.
The first meeting of the Franklin is today.

09:38.954 --> 09:40.330
- Yes, it is.
- 4:00.

09:40.414 --> 09:41.832
Sounds good.

09:43.333 --> 09:45.794
Weekends were never mentioned.
I need my weekends.

09:45.878 --> 09:48.463
All of this gets done on weekends.

10:10.611 --> 10:12.362
- Jess.
- Luke.

10:17.451 --> 10:18.911
Okay, so...

10:33.383 --> 10:35.052
This is my diner.

10:36.178 --> 10:38.305
It belonged to your grandpa.

10:49.107 --> 10:50.484
Here we are.

10:52.110 --> 10:54.780
It's pretty simple. This is the room.

10:55.697 --> 11:00.035
That's my bed. That's your bed for now,
but the sheets are new.

11:00.118 --> 11:03.455
There's the bathroom,
there's the closet, there's the dresser...

11:03.497 --> 11:06.291
the phone, and over there is the kitchen.

11:07.084 --> 11:08.794
I've got Frosted Flakes.

11:08.877 --> 11:11.046
Wow, that's great.

11:12.172 --> 11:14.383
- Is that all your stuff?
- Yup.

11:16.552 --> 11:19.805
- Not much there.
- Lizzie's sending the rest later.

11:20.305 --> 11:22.307
- You need some help?
- Nope.

11:23.851 --> 11:26.186
I have to get back to the diner.

11:26.603 --> 11:30.566
- I'm going to close at 10:00, so I thought...
- See you at 10:00.

11:30.816 --> 11:33.402
- But wait. You need keys.
- No, I don't.

11:36.572 --> 11:38.407
I so don't want to know why.

12:30.375 --> 12:34.213
The op-ed page is sad.
It's worse than sad. It's unopinionated.

12:34.254 --> 12:36.048
Pick a side, people.

12:37.216 --> 12:38.592
- Rory.
- Hey.

12:38.675 --> 12:41.678
- Nice of you to join us.
- I thought we were starting at 4:00.

12:41.762 --> 12:43.514
No, we start at 3:15 sharp.

12:43.555 --> 12:46.016
- We're wasting time here.
- Take a seat.

12:46.099 --> 12:47.142
Sorry.

12:47.226 --> 12:50.979
Okay, so we were just finishing up
handing out the first assignments.

12:51.230 --> 12:53.607
Rory, unfortunately,
since you got here so late...

12:53.690 --> 12:55.567
everything of interest has been given out.

12:55.651 --> 12:59.613
- Why, I'm shocked.
- Wait, just let me check my list here.

12:59.696 --> 13:02.115
There might be something left for you.

13:02.658 --> 13:04.910
They're paving
the new parking lot tomorrow.

13:04.993 --> 13:06.662
- And?
- You can cover it.

13:06.745 --> 13:08.622
- Cover what?
- The paving process.

13:08.705 --> 13:10.415
- You're serious?
- Absolutely.

13:10.457 --> 13:12.334
I'm sure there's an angle somewhere.

13:12.417 --> 13:16.046
Is it environmentally safe?
What are the financial ramifications?

13:16.129 --> 13:19.633
Should brick have been considered,
taking into account the architecture?

13:19.716 --> 13:21.051
Yeah, I get the idea.

13:21.134 --> 13:25.222
If you think this is below you,
you can wait until the next issue.

13:25.430 --> 13:27.641
You can use this time
to get a nice manicure.

13:27.724 --> 13:29.226
- That's okay.
- Maybe get a massage.

13:29.268 --> 13:32.020
- I'll do it.
- Aromatherapy. Smell like a peach.

13:32.104 --> 13:34.857
- I'll do it, okay? I'll cover the paving.
- Okay, good.

13:34.940 --> 13:36.608
I guess that's it.

13:44.283 --> 13:47.452
- Problem, Miss Gilmore?
- No problem at all. I love this assignment.

13:47.536 --> 13:48.537
I'm glad.

13:48.620 --> 13:50.914
I'll write the best piece
on pavement you've read.

13:50.998 --> 13:51.999
I hope so.

13:52.082 --> 13:55.335
I'll be thrilled with next week's scoop
on the plumbing installation.

13:55.419 --> 13:56.420
I like a team player.

13:56.503 --> 13:59.965
No matter how many crappy,
stupid assignments you throw at me...

14:00.048 --> 14:02.467
I'm not going to quit,
and I'm not going to back down.

14:02.551 --> 14:04.928
You can go home tonight
and think about the fact...

14:05.012 --> 14:07.264
that no matter what you do
and how evil you are...

14:07.306 --> 14:09.808
at the end of the year,
on my high school transcript...

14:09.892 --> 14:11.810
it will say that I worked on the Franklin.

14:11.894 --> 14:16.148
If you'll excuse me, I have some reading
to do on the origins of concrete.

14:16.481 --> 14:18.567
A thousand words on my desk on Tuesday.

14:30.829 --> 14:32.080
Sorry.

14:37.169 --> 14:38.295
Hi.

14:39.338 --> 14:41.215
- Sorry.
- No, I just...

14:41.507 --> 14:44.635
- You want some coffee?
- I'll just lick it off the table.

14:44.676 --> 14:46.261
- So?
- So what?

14:46.345 --> 14:47.930
- Is he here?
- He's here.

14:48.013 --> 14:49.890
- Yeah? How is he?
- He's fine.

14:49.973 --> 14:51.934
- Did he see the bed?
- He saw the bed.

14:52.017 --> 14:54.853
- Where is he? I want to meet him.
- He's out.

14:54.895 --> 14:56.939
- Out where?
- I don't know.

14:57.022 --> 14:59.358
- You don't?
- No, he just went out.

14:59.441 --> 15:01.693
- You didn't ask him where he was going?
- No.

15:01.777 --> 15:03.820
- Why not?
- Because he's not two.

15:03.904 --> 15:07.324
But, Luke, he's new in town.
He doesn't know his way around yet.

15:07.366 --> 15:09.368
Way around what? This is Stars Hollow.

15:09.409 --> 15:11.912
Take three left turns,
you're back in the center of town.

15:11.995 --> 15:14.873
When a kid goes out,
you have to ask where he's going.

15:14.915 --> 15:17.709
- Why?
- Because you're responsible for him now.

15:17.751 --> 15:20.671
If he knocks over a liquor store,
it's going to be your fault.

15:20.712 --> 15:24.341
If I had asked him and he actually intended
to knock off a liquor store...

15:24.383 --> 15:26.218
you really think he would have told me?

15:26.301 --> 15:28.846
- Lf he's dumb.
- He's fine. New topic.

15:29.179 --> 15:31.306
Jess, good. I'd like you to meet someone.

15:31.390 --> 15:34.101
Hi. I'm Lorelai.

15:34.226 --> 15:36.687
I wanted to meet you
before Luke filled your head...

15:36.770 --> 15:38.438
with all kinds of lies about me.

15:38.897 --> 15:41.233
You should meet my daughter.
She's about your age.

15:41.275 --> 15:44.361
She can show you
where all the good wilding goes on.

15:45.404 --> 15:47.906
Okay, it's nice to meet you.

15:47.948 --> 15:49.908
I hope you like it here.

15:51.285 --> 15:53.203
So, class dismissed.

15:53.579 --> 15:55.914
Are you hungry? 'Cause I can...

15:57.541 --> 15:59.168
- So that's Jess.
- Yep.

15:59.251 --> 16:00.627
Very chatty.

16:00.836 --> 16:03.130
He's adjusting. He just got here.

16:03.213 --> 16:06.133
He probably just realized
there are 12 stores in this town...

16:06.216 --> 16:08.468
devoted entirely
to peddling porcelain unicorns.

16:08.552 --> 16:11.555
I've lived in this town my entire life,
I still can't believe it.

16:11.638 --> 16:13.974
- I'm sure that's it.
- He'll be fine in a few days.

16:14.057 --> 16:16.768
I have a fabulous idea.
What are you doing tomorrow night?

16:16.810 --> 16:17.853
Why?

16:17.936 --> 16:19.897
Why don't you and Jess
come over for dinner?

16:19.938 --> 16:21.982
Sookie will cook, Rory will be there.

16:22.065 --> 16:24.776
It'll be a little,
'Hey, welcome to Stars Hollow.

16:24.860 --> 16:28.989
'See, everyone here is not straight
out of a Fellini film' kind of an evening.

16:29.072 --> 16:32.117
- Okay, that would be nice. Thanks.
- You're welcome.

16:32.201 --> 16:35.662
- You won't bring up the bed?
- I'll definitely bring up the bed.

16:40.542 --> 16:42.294
- My God, I hate her.
- Me, too.

16:42.336 --> 16:45.047
- You've no idea who I'm talking about.
- Solidarity, sister.

16:45.130 --> 16:47.341
- Paris.
- That I should have guessed.

16:47.424 --> 16:50.552
- She can't torture me off the paper.
- No, she can't.

16:50.636 --> 16:52.095
I have never met anyone like her.

16:52.179 --> 16:54.640
Her insistence on holding
on to this stupid grudge...

16:54.723 --> 16:56.767
that is based on nothing
and will never end...

16:56.850 --> 16:59.520
shows commitment
that I would have never thought possible.

16:59.603 --> 17:01.980
- I'm beginning to admire her.
- First day sucked?

17:02.064 --> 17:05.608
- Just the paper stuff. The rest was good.
- I'm glad to hear it.

17:05.692 --> 17:08.028
Did you happen to run into Max?

17:08.319 --> 17:10.196
- Actually, no.
- Really?

17:10.364 --> 17:12.449
Yeah. Our paths just didn't cross.

17:12.532 --> 17:14.992
- Isn't he your lit. Teacher?
- Yeah.

17:15.035 --> 17:17.704
But I have really tall people
sitting in front of me.

17:19.748 --> 17:22.084
I saw him in the hallway
and I walked the other way.

17:22.166 --> 17:23.167
Why?

17:23.252 --> 17:25.212
I thought that's what you'd want me to do.

17:25.295 --> 17:27.589
Just because Max
isn't a part of my life anymore...

17:27.673 --> 17:29.550
doesn't mean he can't be a part of yours.

17:29.633 --> 17:32.302
He has to be.
You have to see him and talk to him.

17:32.386 --> 17:34.471
And that's okay. That's good.

17:34.513 --> 17:36.682
I know everything
seems screwed up right now...

17:36.765 --> 17:38.684
but I don't want you to avoid him.

17:38.725 --> 17:41.728
- Especially not on my account, okay?
- All right.

17:41.812 --> 17:44.189
- I'm sorry I put you in this position.
- That's okay.

17:44.231 --> 17:47.025
- It's going on the list.
- My God, that list is getting long.

17:47.109 --> 17:48.110
You have no idea.

17:48.694 --> 17:50.529
We are having
a gathering tomorrow night.

17:50.571 --> 17:51.864
What kind of gathering?

17:51.905 --> 17:54.199
Luke's nephew's here
and I thought we could try...

17:54.241 --> 17:56.034
- to make him feel at home.
- You met him?

17:56.076 --> 17:57.661
- Sort of.
- What's he like?

17:57.744 --> 17:59.246
He's not going to be subbing...

17:59.329 --> 18:01.582
for the new dodo on
the Regis show anytime soon.

18:01.665 --> 18:03.125
Let's put it like that.

18:13.969 --> 18:15.345
You got unpacked?

18:15.929 --> 18:18.682
- Got enough space in the closet?
- Plenty.

18:19.725 --> 18:21.727
- You hungry?
- Eighteen.

18:22.227 --> 18:23.312
What?

18:23.395 --> 18:26.481
Just counting
how many questions till we hit 20.

18:26.565 --> 18:28.233
Okay, never mind.

18:31.403 --> 18:34.364
Yeah, Liz, he got here fine.

18:34.489 --> 18:37.159
- Got here at 10:00 this morning.
- Hang on a second.

18:37.242 --> 18:38.702
- Jess?
- Pass.

18:39.870 --> 18:41.413
- Come on.
- Nope.

18:41.497 --> 18:43.040
What am I supposed to tell her?

18:43.123 --> 18:45.417
Tell her I got to take
another crack at the closet.

18:45.459 --> 18:48.420
I think I hung my Tool T-shirt
next to my Metallica T-shirt...

18:48.462 --> 18:49.546
and they don't get along.

18:49.588 --> 18:50.881
You want me to tell her that?

18:50.923 --> 18:54.009
You think a different band combo
would sell it more?

18:54.092 --> 18:56.512
Yeah, Liz,
Jess is going to have to call you back.

18:56.595 --> 19:00.641
Yeah, he's helping me out
with a shelf thing and his hands are full.

19:00.724 --> 19:03.769
Yeah, I'll tell him. Okay. Bye.

19:05.479 --> 19:08.941
She said to tell you
that your stuff will be here on Friday.

19:09.024 --> 19:10.317
Great. We'll have a party.

19:10.400 --> 19:13.028
You know, your mom thinks this is...

19:13.904 --> 19:16.198
for the best, for your own good.

19:17.783 --> 19:21.453
Anyhow, I guess you'll just call her
when you feel like it.

19:21.537 --> 19:23.455
Want to play some poker?
$5 bucks a hand?

19:23.539 --> 19:24.873
- No.
- $10?

19:24.957 --> 19:26.416
I can't go higher than $10.

19:26.500 --> 19:28.502
- Okay, $15.
- I don't want to play poker.

19:28.585 --> 19:30.295
- You sure?
- I'm sure.

19:30.379 --> 19:31.755
Okey-dokey.

19:34.508 --> 19:37.386
So listen, Lorelai,
you met her today, remember?

19:38.387 --> 19:39.763
Anyhow...

19:40.097 --> 19:43.976
she invited us to her house
tomorrow night for dinner.

19:44.059 --> 19:47.271
Her daughter Rory,
who you didn't meet, but you'll like...

19:47.312 --> 19:48.897
'cause she's a lot like Lorelai...

19:48.981 --> 19:52.943
but she's got
a slightly tighter grasp on reality.

19:53.360 --> 19:55.696
Anyhow, she'll be there.

19:57.531 --> 20:00.576
It'd be a chance for you
to meet more people...

20:01.160 --> 20:03.537
and so I said yes.

20:18.677 --> 20:20.012
- Hello.
- Hi.

20:20.095 --> 20:21.138
You're early.

20:21.221 --> 20:23.307
I felt so bad about the mix-up last time...

20:23.348 --> 20:25.934
I wanted to make sure
it didn't happen again.

20:26.059 --> 20:27.352
It won't.

20:28.854 --> 20:31.815
Did you hear that Kimber Slately
and Tristin are a major item?

20:31.857 --> 20:35.068
I thought she and Sean Asher
were this year's John and Jackie.

20:35.152 --> 20:36.862
Nope, Sean is with Dee McGuire now...

20:36.945 --> 20:39.239
which pushed Jeff Traner
into Dottie Lord's arms...

20:39.323 --> 20:41.825
leaving Madison Maylands alone
for the first weekend...

20:41.867 --> 20:43.952
since he became captain
of the lacrosse team.

20:44.036 --> 20:46.663
You know so much so soon.
You have the gift.

20:46.705 --> 20:47.706
I know.

20:47.789 --> 20:51.835
Paris, what do you think about me
writing a gossip column for the Franklin?

20:52.461 --> 20:55.172
I don't know. That's a hard one.

20:55.464 --> 20:57.216
I mean, this is the Franklin...

20:57.299 --> 20:59.718
a newspaper that's been around
for almost 100 years.

20:59.801 --> 21:02.221
There have been
10 former editors of the Franklin...

21:02.262 --> 21:03.931
that have gone to the New York Times.

21:04.014 --> 21:06.141
Six have gone on to the Washington Post.

21:06.225 --> 21:08.685
Three are contributing editors
at the New Yorker.

21:08.769 --> 21:11.563
I think one even went on
to win the Pulitzer prize.

21:11.605 --> 21:12.898
But never mind them.

21:12.981 --> 21:15.901
I could be the first editor
in the history of the Franklin...

21:15.943 --> 21:19.821
to introduce a column exclusively devoted
to who Biffy's boffing today.

21:20.030 --> 21:21.490
Quandary.

21:21.573 --> 21:24.284
I'm going to have to get back to you
on that one.

21:24.409 --> 21:25.536
Okay.

21:25.619 --> 21:27.246
Good, we're all here.

21:28.413 --> 21:30.415
And prompt. Lovely.

21:31.625 --> 21:35.337
I read everyone's article and they were
all extremely well done.

21:35.420 --> 21:37.798
Snappy, informative, well-researched.

21:37.965 --> 21:41.051
Paris, you should be very proud
of the team you've assembled.

21:41.093 --> 21:42.177
Thank you.

21:42.261 --> 21:45.597
When you've got a reporter who can take
an incredibly mundane...

21:45.639 --> 21:47.641
and seemingly unimportant subject...

21:47.724 --> 21:49.977
like the repaving
of the faculty parking lot...

21:50.060 --> 21:53.564
and turn it into a bittersweet piece
on how everybody and everything...

21:53.605 --> 21:57.359
eventually becomes obsolete,
then you've really got something.

21:57.442 --> 21:58.944
Miss Gilmore, I was touched.

21:59.027 --> 22:00.404
I owe it all to Paris.

22:00.445 --> 22:03.448
I would strongly advise
that next time you give Miss Gilmore...

22:03.490 --> 22:05.492
something with more meat to it.

22:05.951 --> 22:07.703
Yeah, great idea.

22:07.870 --> 22:09.538
Okay. Let's get down to work.

22:09.621 --> 22:11.748
We've got a layout to put together.

22:19.047 --> 22:20.340
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

22:20.424 --> 22:22.009
You must be very proud of yourself.

22:22.092 --> 22:24.178
I'm not hiding when I pass a mirror.

22:24.261 --> 22:28.640
It's part of my job to make sure that our
best writers are writing our best pieces.

22:29.516 --> 22:31.894
So I'm going to give you
one of our best pieces.

22:31.977 --> 22:34.146
Front page, lead story.

22:34.229 --> 22:35.439
Get to the catch.

22:35.480 --> 22:37.024
- No catch.
- No catch?

22:37.107 --> 22:39.318
I'd like to start our year off with a profile...

22:39.401 --> 22:41.695
on the teacher voted most popular
from last year.

22:41.778 --> 22:44.698
You know, an in-depth,
no-holds-barred interview.

22:44.823 --> 22:46.074
Everybody wants it.

22:46.158 --> 22:47.576
You have it.

22:47.659 --> 22:49.620
- You're kidding.
- Nope.

22:50.662 --> 22:52.873
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

22:53.540 --> 22:56.376
Go ahead and set up
that interview with Mr. Medina.

22:56.460 --> 22:57.544
What?

22:57.628 --> 23:00.088
I'd love it to lead off our first edition.

23:00.964 --> 23:02.466
He was the winner by a landslide.

23:02.508 --> 23:04.426
I'm sorry. Is there a problem?

23:05.302 --> 23:08.263
Is there some reason
why you wouldn't want to interview him?

23:08.347 --> 23:12.684
After all, you of all people should be able
to get the most in-depth story out of him...

23:12.768 --> 23:15.437
especially since he and your mother
are involved.

23:15.521 --> 23:17.147
They are still involved, aren't they?

23:17.189 --> 23:20.025
Let's leave
my mother's personal life out of this.

23:20.651 --> 23:22.486
- That sounds bad.
- It's not bad.

23:22.528 --> 23:24.821
- It's just none of your business.
- Fine.

23:24.863 --> 23:26.907
You want the interview or not?

23:26.990 --> 23:28.826
- Yes, I want the interview.
- Good.

23:28.867 --> 23:31.787
Get me something more
than his favorite color, okay?

23:35.666 --> 23:37.292
Maybe I should make grilled cheese.

23:37.376 --> 23:38.836
But you're making pot roast.

23:38.877 --> 23:40.504
Not everybody likes pot roast.

23:40.546 --> 23:44.007
Then they can have chicken wings,
the mashed potatoes, the four salads...

23:44.091 --> 23:45.634
in addition to the pot roast.

23:45.717 --> 23:47.553
Yeah, I guess you're right.

23:47.594 --> 23:49.680
So I should start slicing the cheese.

23:49.763 --> 23:51.723
Would you? That would be great!

23:52.140 --> 23:54.476
Wow, something smells good!

23:54.560 --> 23:56.186
- It's the garlic.
- Three heads of it.

23:56.228 --> 23:58.230
- Nice.
- I want everything to be perfect.

23:58.313 --> 24:00.816
We are going to make this kid
think he went to heaven.

24:00.899 --> 24:02.734
Or Henry the VllI's house.

24:02.943 --> 24:04.653
- Milady?
- Come in.

24:05.904 --> 24:07.739
- You joining the festivities?
- In a sec.

24:07.823 --> 24:09.491
- You sound crabby.
- I'm concentrating.

24:09.575 --> 24:10.909
Don't concentrate too hard.

24:10.993 --> 24:12.202
Boys like them dumb. Right?

24:12.244 --> 24:15.581
If you can navigate yourself around a tree,
keep on walking.

24:15.789 --> 24:17.416
Coming!

24:17.499 --> 24:19.334
What if he doesn't do dairy?

24:21.879 --> 24:22.880
Perfect timing.

24:22.963 --> 24:26.216
Sookie's about to break her own record
for the most food served.

24:26.258 --> 24:27.843
- Sounds great.
- Sure does.

24:27.926 --> 24:29.511
So, come on in.

24:34.099 --> 24:35.601
Sorry we're a little late.

24:35.642 --> 24:39.021
We had a misunderstanding about
what time we were supposed to leave.

24:39.104 --> 24:40.731
That's okay. How's it going?

24:40.772 --> 24:42.941
Not bad. The bed popped.

24:43.650 --> 24:44.943
- Was anyone in it?
- Me.

24:45.027 --> 24:46.737
- You?
- I let him take the real one.

24:46.778 --> 24:48.989
It was very nice of you.

24:51.700 --> 24:54.328
You want to come on in the kitchen?

24:55.287 --> 24:57.873
Sookie, Jackson, I want you
to meet Luke's nephew.

24:57.956 --> 24:59.750
- This is Jess.
- Do you eat cheese?

24:59.791 --> 25:01.001
What?

25:01.293 --> 25:04.421
This is the greatest lemon I've ever grown!
This is a great lemon.

25:04.463 --> 25:06.798
Sookie, you got to try this lemon.

25:06.882 --> 25:08.258
That is a great lemon!

25:08.300 --> 25:09.426
Try it! It's a Meyer!

25:09.468 --> 25:11.845
Jackson grows fruit
and scares people with it.

25:11.929 --> 25:13.764
- Rory, they're here.
- Coming.

25:15.599 --> 25:17.059
Hey.

25:17.309 --> 25:18.310
I'm Rory.

25:18.477 --> 25:21.188
- Yeah, I figured.
- Nice to meet you.

25:23.065 --> 25:25.359
Aren't we hooked on phonics?

25:25.442 --> 25:27.694
I read a lot. Do you read?

25:28.987 --> 25:30.572
Not much.

25:30.656 --> 25:32.825
I could loan you that. It's great.

25:33.325 --> 25:35.202
No, thanks.

25:35.285 --> 25:36.995
If you change your mind.

25:37.246 --> 25:39.331
We need to
get Jackson away from the lemons...

25:39.414 --> 25:41.416
so we're moving
the feast to the living room.

25:41.500 --> 25:42.960
Be right there.

25:44.336 --> 25:45.462
Do these open?

25:45.504 --> 25:47.714
You just have to unlatch them
and then push.

25:47.798 --> 25:49.132
Great. Shall we?

25:49.174 --> 25:51.218
- Shall we what?
- Bail.

25:51.802 --> 25:53.554
- No.
- Why?

25:53.637 --> 25:56.014
Because it's Tuesday night
in Stars Hollow.

25:56.098 --> 25:57.474
There's nowhere to bail to.

25:57.516 --> 25:59.560
The 24-hour mini-mart
closed 20 minutes ago.

25:59.643 --> 26:02.521
We'll walk around or sit on a bench
and stare at our shoes.

26:02.604 --> 26:05.023
Sookie just made
a ton of really great food...

26:05.065 --> 26:08.527
and though it may not seem like it
at this moment, it's going to be fun.

26:08.569 --> 26:10.445
- Trust me.
- I don't even know you.

26:10.529 --> 26:12.322
- Don't I look trustworthy?
- Maybe.

26:12.364 --> 26:13.949
Good. Let's eat.

26:16.702 --> 26:17.870
You want a soda?

26:17.953 --> 26:19.997
- I'll get it.
- Okay.

26:32.968 --> 26:35.220
Do you know
Pam was originally made out of rice?

26:35.262 --> 26:36.263
What?

26:37.472 --> 26:38.640
Rory, where's Jess?

26:38.724 --> 26:40.184
He's getting a soda.

26:40.350 --> 26:41.935
You must've mistaken me for you.

26:42.019 --> 26:43.896
Too much? I forgot the garlic bread.

26:43.979 --> 26:45.314
I'll get it.

26:47.024 --> 26:48.525
- More potatoes?
- Okay.

26:48.609 --> 26:50.402
Everyone needs more potatoes.

26:50.444 --> 26:53.822
- Nothing wrong with potatoes.
- I've got 6 pounds in the oven.

26:56.575 --> 26:57.951
More chicken?

26:58.035 --> 27:00.370
- Throw a couple of bird wings on there.
- All right.

27:00.412 --> 27:03.540
- Salad, no dressing.
- Want some more?

27:04.082 --> 27:05.626
- You want some?
- Okay.

27:14.134 --> 27:16.512
For me? Hey, thanks.

27:19.598 --> 27:20.974
Refreshing.

27:21.934 --> 27:24.394
- So what? You're not hungry?
- Not really.

27:25.187 --> 27:28.232
Sookie made you some grilled cheese
if you don't like pot roast.

27:28.273 --> 27:30.275
Well, if I'd known that.

27:32.027 --> 27:34.738
- Let me guess. You don't want to be here.
- Doesn't matter.

27:34.780 --> 27:37.199
I mean, here in Stars Hollow.

27:37.282 --> 27:38.283
Jeez, Miss Gilmore.

27:38.325 --> 27:40.744
Why would anyone not want
to be here in Stars Hollow?

27:40.786 --> 27:42.621
That just sounds plum crazy.

27:42.788 --> 27:45.082
Jess, let me give you a little advice.

27:45.457 --> 27:47.835
The whole
'my parents don't get me' thing...

27:47.918 --> 27:49.753
- I've been there.
- You have?

27:49.795 --> 27:53.423
Yes, I have. I've also done
the 'chip on my shoulder' bit.

27:53.507 --> 27:57.302
The surly, sarcastic
'the world can bite my ass' bit.

27:57.636 --> 28:00.681
And let me tell you, I mastered them all.
In heels, yet.

28:00.806 --> 28:03.517
Everything you're feeling
might be totally justified.

28:03.600 --> 28:05.310
Maybe you are getting screwed.

28:05.394 --> 28:08.146
But Luke is a great guy.

28:08.981 --> 28:10.315
He's very special.

28:10.357 --> 28:14.695
And he really wants to take care of you
and make things right for you.

28:15.612 --> 28:18.115
You're incredibly lucky to have him.

28:18.198 --> 28:20.409
If you give this situation half a chance...

28:20.492 --> 28:22.703
you might be surprised
at how good it can be.

28:22.786 --> 28:24.454
How much you like living here...

28:24.496 --> 28:28.876
how comfortable it feels to have someone
like Luke you can really depend on.

28:29.668 --> 28:32.045
What? Are you sleeping with him
or something?

28:32.129 --> 28:33.213
Excuse me?

28:33.297 --> 28:34.631
The whole starry-eyed...

28:34.673 --> 28:37.384
'you're so much better off,
just give it a chance' speech.

28:37.467 --> 28:40.679
You're either really naive
or you're getting some.

28:41.680 --> 28:43.807
There have been
very few moments in my life...

28:43.849 --> 28:47.060
where I've actually wished
I had one of those enormous cream pies...

28:47.144 --> 28:50.147
you can smash in someone's face.
This is definitely one of them.

28:50.189 --> 28:51.690
Now that's not very neighborly.

28:51.732 --> 28:53.650
You know what? This is my house.

28:53.692 --> 28:55.819
I choose how I get talked to in it.

28:55.903 --> 28:59.656
You don't know anything about me,
or my life, or my mom, or Luke.

28:59.698 --> 29:01.825
So why don't you Dr. Laura someone else?

29:01.909 --> 29:04.661
I'm going inside. Stay out of my fridge.

29:11.877 --> 29:12.878
Where's Jess?

29:12.961 --> 29:15.714
Outside working on his Breakfast Club
audition. He's good.

29:15.797 --> 29:17.508
- What?
- I'm sorry.

29:17.549 --> 29:20.010
That kid is way more screwed up
than you think he is.

29:20.052 --> 29:22.179
- What?
- I catch him outside with a beer.

29:22.221 --> 29:24.723
I don't even bust him on it.
I try talking to him.

29:24.765 --> 29:26.934
What do you mean 'talk to him'?
What did you say?

29:27.017 --> 29:30.521
I said he's got a good thing going here
with you and he shouldn't blow it.

29:30.562 --> 29:31.813
Then he just got charming.

29:31.897 --> 29:34.525
What are you doing
talking to him about stuff like that?

29:34.566 --> 29:36.818
- I'm trying to help you.
- I don't need your help.

29:36.902 --> 29:37.903
You do.

29:37.986 --> 29:40.906
Here we go again with this
I'm not prepared for this crap.

29:40.989 --> 29:44.743
This is not crap. This is the truth.
You should've heard him talking.

29:44.785 --> 29:46.328
I don't need to hear him talking.

29:46.411 --> 29:48.330
He's my nephew
and I know what I'm doing...

29:48.413 --> 29:50.707
and I'm getting tired
of your condescending...

29:50.749 --> 29:54.086
- I'm not being condescending.
- You have a kid, so you know everything?

29:54.127 --> 29:56.922
I have a kid,
so I know a little more than you do.

29:56.964 --> 29:59.800
You ever think
maybe you just got lucky with Rory?

29:59.883 --> 30:01.343
You did get pregnant at 16.

30:01.426 --> 30:05.013
That doesn't show the greatest
decision-making skills, does it?

30:05.138 --> 30:06.932
Two pies.

30:07.015 --> 30:10.269
- What the hell are you talking about?
- I'm talking about nothing.

30:10.352 --> 30:13.397
You won't have to hear my opinion
on anything ever again, okay?

30:13.438 --> 30:15.566
- Don't tease.
- Go find Jess.

30:16.275 --> 30:18.235
Don't tell me what to do.

30:23.782 --> 30:25.993
- You're being completely childish.
- Am not.

30:26.076 --> 30:29.329
We're never going to go into Luke's again?
We're just going to starve?

30:29.413 --> 30:31.623
This was a bad one.
This was not Nick and Nora.

30:31.707 --> 30:33.792
This was Sid and Nancy.
I'm not going in there.

30:33.876 --> 30:35.627
The coffee is in there. It's Danish day.

30:35.711 --> 30:39.256
Are you telling me you'll let a fight
get in the way of Danish day?

30:39.339 --> 30:40.382
- No.
- Good.

30:40.465 --> 30:42.759
Go in and order two coffees
and two Danishes to go.

30:42.801 --> 30:43.969
You're kidding, right?

30:44.052 --> 30:46.388
He's going to know what's going on.
He's not stupid.

30:46.471 --> 30:49.808
He cannot prove that you're not ordering
all that for yourself, can he?

30:49.850 --> 30:51.643
No, so go on.

30:52.186 --> 30:54.229
Scoot. Mommy's right here.

31:01.153 --> 31:04.031
I'll have two coffees
and two cherry Danishes to go, please.

31:04.114 --> 31:07.117
- Two coffees and two cherry Danishes.
- And some napkins.

31:07.159 --> 31:09.453
- One of these is for her, isn't it?
- Who?

31:09.495 --> 31:13.457
No. They're all for me.
I am super hungry today.

31:13.499 --> 31:16.835
I was debating ordering three,
but I'll tell you how I feel after two.

31:16.877 --> 31:19.129
I'll give you one Danish
and one cup of coffee.

31:19.171 --> 31:21.798
You can sit there and eat
and when you're finished...

31:21.840 --> 31:23.634
I'll bring you a second one.

31:23.675 --> 31:26.178
You're going to stand there
and watch me eat a Danish?

31:26.261 --> 31:28.222
Cable's out. I'm starved for entertainment.

31:28.305 --> 31:31.141
This is insane. So you guys had a fight.

31:31.183 --> 31:33.560
Big deal. You know
you're going to make up anyway.

31:33.644 --> 31:35.562
What better day to make up
than Danish day?

31:35.646 --> 31:37.231
The happiest of all days.

31:37.314 --> 31:39.816
The day when we all say,
'Let's forgive and forget...

31:39.900 --> 31:41.777
'over a nice Danish and a cup of coffee. '

31:41.860 --> 31:44.321
One Danish, one cup of coffee.
Take it or leave it.

31:44.363 --> 31:45.864
I'll take it.

31:46.907 --> 31:49.117
I still think you're being silly.

31:49.201 --> 31:51.578
Thank you for sharing. Come back soon.

31:59.753 --> 32:02.214
- Well?
- He would only sell me one.

32:02.548 --> 32:05.509
- Didn't you say they were both for you?
- He knew I was lying.

32:05.592 --> 32:08.804
Did you do the blinky thing?
You always do it when you're lying.

32:08.887 --> 32:09.930
I didn't have to.

32:10.013 --> 32:12.516
He knows that you're not going to go
a whole day...

32:12.599 --> 32:14.810
with no coffee and especially no Danish.

32:14.893 --> 32:17.229
Why don't you go in there now
and make up?

32:17.312 --> 32:19.857
Why don't you give me
half your Danish and some coffee?

32:19.898 --> 32:22.317
I'll give you the Danish
but I'm keeping the coffee.

32:22.401 --> 32:23.902
What is a Danish without coffee?

32:23.986 --> 32:25.737
The eternal question springs up again.

32:25.779 --> 32:28.365
There's no point
in even eating a Danish without coffee.

32:28.448 --> 32:30.742
- I'm going to school.
- Sad Danish. Lonely Danish.

32:30.784 --> 32:32.953
- Step-Danish.
- I'll see you tonight.

32:37.082 --> 32:38.417
Hey, kid.

32:38.876 --> 32:40.836
Do me a favor? Come here.

32:46.925 --> 32:48.093
Please?

32:57.436 --> 32:59.188
What is it, Taylor?

32:59.646 --> 33:01.815
Slow down. You're babbling.

33:03.192 --> 33:05.319
How do you know it was Jess?

33:06.528 --> 33:08.906
Okay, Taylor. I'll talk to him.

33:08.947 --> 33:11.825
But if he tells me he didn't do it
and nobody saw him do it...

33:11.909 --> 33:14.119
then he is off the hook. Understand?

33:25.005 --> 33:26.006
Hi.

33:27.216 --> 33:29.134
- Am I too early? 'Cause I can...
- No.

33:29.218 --> 33:31.345
...come back some other time.
- This is fine.

33:31.428 --> 33:33.639
- Tomorrow, maybe.
- Now is good.

33:35.182 --> 33:37.351
- This is weird.
- Yeah, it is.

33:37.476 --> 33:40.812
- I don't really know how to act.
- I'm not sure of that myself.

33:42.940 --> 33:44.650
- We could sit.
- Sit?

33:44.691 --> 33:47.361
Sure, that's good. Barbara Walters sits.

33:47.444 --> 33:49.446
Or walks, if the person she's talking to...

33:49.530 --> 33:52.991
has a horse or a ranch
or a big backyard sometimes...

33:53.033 --> 33:55.118
but usually she just sits.

33:57.371 --> 34:00.249
I guess we should just start.

34:00.499 --> 34:01.792
Good idea.

34:01.834 --> 34:04.670
- Do you mind if I tape this?
- Not at all.

34:07.756 --> 34:10.007
I guess I'll just dive in.

34:10.676 --> 34:13.887
- Full name?
- Max Arturo Medina.

34:13.971 --> 34:15.848
- You're kidding?
- No. I'm not.

34:15.889 --> 34:19.016
- Where does that come from?
- My father's butcher was named Arturo.

34:19.101 --> 34:21.436
- Really?
- When my mother was pregnant with me...

34:21.520 --> 34:23.563
she would eat only lamb chops.

34:23.647 --> 34:25.983
Arturo would cut her
the extra-large lamb chops...

34:26.024 --> 34:28.443
and only charge her
for the regular-size lamb chops...

34:28.527 --> 34:30.821
which in my family
made you eligible for sainthood.

34:30.862 --> 34:32.906
- Hence the Arturo.
- That's right.

34:32.989 --> 34:34.824
I assume that you are aware...

34:34.867 --> 34:37.744
that you were voted
the students' favorite teacher last year.

34:37.828 --> 34:40.371
I teach an exceptional bunch
of young people.

34:40.455 --> 34:43.083
I'm glad they seem to like me
as much as I like them.

34:43.167 --> 34:45.752
Have you thought of doing something
other than teaching?

34:45.835 --> 34:48.463
My father wanted me to be a doctor...

34:48.547 --> 34:51.049
and my mother wanted me
to be President.

34:51.132 --> 34:53.927
I wanted to be a clown.

34:54.219 --> 34:55.219
What?

34:55.304 --> 34:57.097
When I was a kid, I went to the circus...

34:57.181 --> 35:00.976
and I saw this man
who was dressed in this crazy outfit.

35:01.226 --> 35:04.688
He could juggle and he rode
on an elephant and the people loved him.

35:04.771 --> 35:07.232
I thought, 'That's it. That's for me. '

35:07.274 --> 35:09.401
- How long did that last?
- Junior high.

35:09.484 --> 35:12.029
And then slowly I figured out
that I wanted to teach.

35:12.070 --> 35:14.865
Plus, when you told people
that you wanted to be a clown...

35:14.907 --> 35:17.409
they tended to get very frightened.

35:17.493 --> 35:21.163
Mom took me to the circus once
when I was really little...

35:21.246 --> 35:24.082
and this clown knocked into me
and I dropped my cotton candy.

35:24.166 --> 35:26.084
We didn't have a lot of money back then...

35:26.168 --> 35:29.046
so she couldn't buy me another one
and I started crying.

35:29.087 --> 35:32.007
She literally chased the clown onstage...

35:32.090 --> 35:34.718
ripped off his wig
and said she wouldn't give it back...

35:34.760 --> 35:37.387
- unless he bought me another candy.
- Which I bet he did.

35:37.429 --> 35:40.224
It was twice as big
and I threw up all the way home.

35:40.265 --> 35:41.391
Yeah.

35:42.267 --> 35:44.353
That sounds like your mom.

35:45.437 --> 35:48.482
Do you ever regret the fact
that you didn't become a clown?

35:48.565 --> 35:50.359
I don't really believe in regrets.

35:50.442 --> 35:54.363
All my experiences, even the ones that
didn't turn out the way I wanted them to...

35:54.446 --> 35:57.157
I firmly believe they were all worth it.

36:03.914 --> 36:05.958
I just want you to know...

36:06.291 --> 36:09.044
I really wanted you to be my stepfather.

36:12.422 --> 36:14.466
I just want you to know...

36:15.133 --> 36:17.761
I really wanted to be your stepfather.

36:28.188 --> 36:31.275
What would you say
are the great challenges...

36:31.316 --> 36:34.862
- facing high school graduates today?
- A myriad of things, really.

36:42.244 --> 36:44.246
- How was school?
- Great.

36:44.621 --> 36:46.790
- You learn anything good?
- Yeah, tons of things.

36:46.832 --> 36:49.960
I got gold stars
plastered all over my forehead.

36:50.419 --> 36:52.129
I had an interesting call today.

36:52.171 --> 36:54.298
- Want to know who it was from?
- Not really.

36:54.339 --> 36:57.176
From Taylor Doose.
You know, he owns the market.

36:57.259 --> 36:59.761
- If you say so.
- He said you came in today.

36:59.887 --> 37:02.389
He said you took some money
out of a donation cup...

37:02.472 --> 37:03.765
to help repair the bridge.

37:03.849 --> 37:07.728
I told him he was crazy,
you wouldn't do that, you weren't a thief.

37:07.811 --> 37:09.271
Then I hung up on him.

37:09.354 --> 37:11.815
Don't get me wrong.
I enjoy hanging up on Taylor.

37:11.899 --> 37:13.025
And he is crazy.

37:13.108 --> 37:16.278
I was just wondering if maybe
any of the things he said were true.

37:16.361 --> 37:17.404
What do you think?

37:17.488 --> 37:20.282
If you tell me what he's saying
is not true, I'll believe it.

37:20.365 --> 37:22.743
- It's not true.
- That doesn't sound very convincing.

37:22.826 --> 37:24.495
What do you want from me?

37:24.578 --> 37:26.705
You bring me here,
you put me in a school...

37:26.788 --> 37:29.333
that says the Pledge of Allegiance
in six languages...

37:29.416 --> 37:31.084
two of which I've never heard of!

37:31.168 --> 37:34.046
You take me away from my home,
my friends, and now you want...

37:34.087 --> 37:36.089
- what from me?
- I'm trying to help you!

37:36.173 --> 37:37.174
Stop trying!

37:37.216 --> 37:40.844
Stop talking to me, stop following me,
stop asking me questions! Just stop!

37:40.928 --> 37:42.137
That's what you want?

37:42.221 --> 37:43.764
- That's really what you want?
- Yes.

37:43.847 --> 37:44.890
Fine! You got it!

37:44.973 --> 37:47.059
- Thank you.
- You're welcome!

37:59.738 --> 38:01.240
Kitchen!

38:02.074 --> 38:05.619
Nowhere in either Stars Hollow
or its surrounding counties...

38:05.702 --> 38:07.996
can you get a decent cup of coffee.

38:08.080 --> 38:11.917
I swear. It's like
a big, stupid coffee conspiracy.

38:11.959 --> 38:14.169
Why don't you pour the water
right into the bag?

38:14.253 --> 38:17.089
You jest? Believe me,
the thought has crossed my mind.

38:17.130 --> 38:19.591
It's looking better all the time.

38:19.633 --> 38:21.969
Where are you going?
I'm not through complaining.

38:22.052 --> 38:23.971
I just have to get some more notes I need.

38:24.054 --> 38:25.430
- What's this?
- What?

38:25.514 --> 38:27.266
This that you're working on?

38:27.349 --> 38:29.685
That's my interview with Max.

38:29.935 --> 38:30.978
What interview with Max?

38:31.061 --> 38:32.521
The paper wanted to do a piece...

38:32.604 --> 38:35.190
on the students' favorite
teacher from the previous year.

38:35.274 --> 38:37.901
Paris assigned it to me
when she caught wind of the fact...

38:37.943 --> 38:39.987
- Nice kid, that Paris.
- Yeah.

38:40.070 --> 38:42.948
It wasn't that bad, though.
It was actually good.

38:43.031 --> 38:45.075
It gave us a chance
to talk about some things.

38:45.159 --> 38:46.952
- Good.
- Yeah. It was good.

38:47.035 --> 38:49.663
I'm going to buy a folder for it
before the store closes.

38:49.746 --> 38:50.831
Okay.

38:53.000 --> 38:55.043
Some good writing here, missy.

38:55.127 --> 38:56.503
- Yeah?
- Really good.

38:56.587 --> 38:59.882
It's not quite up to the repaving piece yet,
but I'll get it there.

38:59.965 --> 39:02.092
Boy, he sounds like
a hell of a guy, doesn't he?

39:02.176 --> 39:03.635
Yeah, he does.

39:07.014 --> 39:09.641
I sure know how to dump them, don't I?

39:15.939 --> 39:18.317
- I just pushed him in a lake.
- What?

39:18.984 --> 39:21.904
I got this call from Taylor
that Jess stole the bridge money.

39:21.987 --> 39:24.531
I went to confront him
and he was being impossible...

39:24.615 --> 39:27.826
and I just pushed him in a lake.
This is bad.

39:27.910 --> 39:31.622
- That depends. Can he swim?
- He's fine. He's wet. I lost it.

39:31.663 --> 39:32.789
You were right.

39:32.873 --> 39:36.168
I am in so far over my head
that I can't see my own hat.

39:36.251 --> 39:37.503
Try turning it around.

39:37.586 --> 39:40.005
What was I thinking?
Why did I say yes to this?

39:40.047 --> 39:43.509
You saw a kid in need of help
and you thought you'd throw him a line.

39:43.550 --> 39:45.677
But me? Raising a kid?
I don't even like kids.

39:45.761 --> 39:48.514
They're always sticky,
like they've got jam on their hands.

39:48.597 --> 39:50.307
Even if there's no jam in the house...

39:50.349 --> 39:52.392
somehow they've always got
jam on their hands.

39:52.476 --> 39:55.562
I'm not the guy to deal with it.
I have no patience for jam hands.

39:55.646 --> 39:58.815
Okay, slow down. First of all, Jess is 17...

39:58.857 --> 40:01.360
so he's probably past
the jam hands stage by now.

40:01.401 --> 40:06.073
Second of all, you can do this.
If you want to, you are totally capable.

40:06.156 --> 40:08.534
But you can't just buy a bed
and some sheets...

40:08.617 --> 40:11.411
and expect the rest to take care of itself.
That won't work.

40:11.495 --> 40:12.788
I swear, I'm going to kill Liz.

40:12.871 --> 40:15.833
Liz is not the point anymore.
Liz is not here. Jess is here.

40:15.874 --> 40:18.502
Focus on him.
What are you going to do about him?

40:18.544 --> 40:21.547
Sugar, I hate to bother you,
but have you seen Pierpon?

40:22.047 --> 40:24.341
- No. Why?
- It's the darnedest thing.

40:24.383 --> 40:27.094
I came out just now
and I noticed that he was gone.

40:27.177 --> 40:29.221
- Just like that.
- I'm sorry. Who's missing?

40:29.304 --> 40:31.640
- Pierpon, gorgeous.
- Her gnome.

40:32.182 --> 40:33.767
The one with the pipe.

40:33.851 --> 40:35.978
Oh, God,
I hope nothing's happened to him.

40:36.061 --> 40:37.980
You get so attached to their little faces...

40:38.063 --> 40:40.315
sometimes you can hear them
talk to you at night.

40:40.399 --> 40:42.359
You know, I wouldn't worry, Babbette.

40:42.442 --> 40:45.445
I think you're going to see Pierpon again.
Really soon.

40:46.029 --> 40:48.824
- Where are you going?
- I have to take care of something.

40:48.907 --> 40:51.618
I'll see you tomorrow at the diner
for your Danish, right?

40:51.702 --> 40:53.662
- Tomorrow isn't Danish day.
- Just be there.

40:53.745 --> 40:55.122
Yes, sir.

41:01.920 --> 41:03.172
Okay.

41:03.255 --> 41:07.676
We got the patch,
the gum, hypnosis tapes...

41:07.759 --> 41:10.804
Chinese herbs, self-help books...

41:10.929 --> 41:14.766
and several pictures of diseased lungs
to hang on the fridge.

41:14.850 --> 41:16.018
Pretty?

41:16.185 --> 41:17.644
This is done.

41:17.728 --> 41:21.648
You will get up, you will go to school,
you will come home.

41:21.732 --> 41:24.985
You will work in the diner until closing,
you will do your homework...

41:25.068 --> 41:27.029
then you will go to bed.
Where's the gnome?

41:27.112 --> 41:28.071
What?

41:28.155 --> 41:31.533
Weekends are for chores
and selected pre-approved outings...

41:31.617 --> 41:35.162
i. e. Cabala studies,
freeway beautification projects...

41:35.245 --> 41:39.625
Color Me Mine pottery painting,
all discussable options.

41:39.875 --> 41:43.170
You will not steal.
You will pay back Taylor Doose...

41:43.253 --> 41:47.382
you will graduate from high school,
and you will return Pierpon to his yard.

41:47.466 --> 41:49.635
- You can't just...
- I can just.

41:49.718 --> 41:52.095
I am not letting you
fall off the face of the earth.

41:52.137 --> 41:56.183
You will not drift. I won't let it happen.
I don't know if this is the right way...

41:56.266 --> 42:00.521
but this is the way it's being handled
and that is the end of this discussion.

42:03.232 --> 42:05.275
- Where are you going?
- Out.

42:07.152 --> 42:08.278
At least I asked.

42:18.413 --> 42:20.457
- Hey, yourself.
- What are you doing out here?

42:20.541 --> 42:22.626
I needed something for school.
What about you?

42:22.709 --> 42:24.169
Yeah, same thing.

42:25.671 --> 42:29.091
So, that was quite a disappearing act
you pulled the other night.

42:29.174 --> 42:31.844
Potlucks and Tupperware parties
aren't really my thing.

42:31.927 --> 42:34.555
- Too cool for school?
- Yes, that is me.

42:35.013 --> 42:37.266
- What are you doing?
- This?

42:38.725 --> 42:40.018
Nothing.

42:41.353 --> 42:43.856
Just another little disappearing act.

42:43.897 --> 42:45.274
- Little tip?
- Yeah.

42:45.357 --> 42:47.985
If you want to speak to me,
don't pull that out of my ear.

42:48.068 --> 42:50.028
I assume the nose is off-limits, too.

42:50.070 --> 42:52.072
Any place
you wouldn't naturally find a coin.

42:52.156 --> 42:53.824
Let's leave it that way.

42:55.534 --> 42:57.244
So what are you doing now?

42:57.327 --> 42:59.454
- I have some homework to finish.
- Okay.

42:59.538 --> 43:02.374
Then I'll leave you this last little trick.

43:03.208 --> 43:05.502
You bought a copy?
I told you I'd lend you mine.

43:05.544 --> 43:07.880
- It is yours.
- You stole my book.

43:07.963 --> 43:09.173
No, borrowed it.

43:09.214 --> 43:11.466
That's not called a trick,
that's called a felony.

43:11.550 --> 43:13.677
I just wanted to put
some notes in the margins.

43:13.719 --> 43:14.845
What?

43:20.184 --> 43:23.020
- You've read this before.
- About 40 times.

43:23.061 --> 43:24.897
I thought you said you didn't read much.

43:24.980 --> 43:26.899
What is much?

43:27.816 --> 43:30.319
- Goodnight, Rory.
- Goodnight, Dodger.

43:32.905 --> 43:34.823
- Dodger?
- Figure it out.

43:36.992 --> 43:38.494
Oliver Twist.

44:26.792 --> 44:27.751
English
