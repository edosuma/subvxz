that the guy
in the pictures is Dom,

15:50.370 --> 15:53.230

the one talking to Kailani.

15:53.300 --> 15:54.800

just send him a message.

do a little phone search.

how we find this guy.

The one thing
we haven't done is looked up

16:23.370 --> 16:25.470
the names of Sam's parents.
- That's true.

16:25.530 --> 16:27.700

No results.

16:33.580 --> 16:34.840
Weird. Okay.

16:34.910 --> 16:36.180

a made up name.

16:36.250 --> 16:38.710

16:50.460 --> 16:56.200
you're one of 15 friends of
Sam DeVecchio on Facebook,

16:56.270 --> 17:00.500

how you guys know each other.

17:03.770 --> 17:05.970

17:07.380 --> 17:09.579
- Was he flirting with you?

17:18.619 --> 17:20.650
- Classic.

17:30.630 --> 17:32.930
- Right, well, he--
yeah, he's lying.

17:33.000 --> 17:34.640
Obviously.

17:34.700 --> 17:35.900
All right, well--

17:35.970 --> 17:37.300
we're not sure
exactly who he is,

17:37.370 --> 17:40.240
but we know he's not
the guy he says he is

17:40.310 --> 17:41.780
so just--
you know, be careful,

17:41.840 --> 17:43.240
and if he tries to contact you,

17:43.310 --> 17:44.780
I think you should--

17:44.850 --> 17:47.310
it'd be best
to just ignore him.

17:47.380 --> 17:48.750

he's been saying...

18:03.400 --> 18:05.230
she'd at least have
the validation that, like,

18:05.300 --> 18:07.270
she matters and
she's important to him,

18:07.340 --> 18:08.840
