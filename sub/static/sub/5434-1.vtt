And no excuses.

02:08.418 --> 02:10.787
I want you to go out

and I want you to be winners!

02:13.827 --> 02:15.727
Thank you.

02:18.927 --> 02:20.917
Thank you.

03:35.145 --> 03:37.134
<i>I'm on my way.</i>

03:37.244 --> 03:41.374
I don't know how long.
I don't know!

03:41.484 --> 03:44.474
Richard, he has
nowhere else to go.

03:47.054 --> 03:50.924
I'm not smoking.
I'm not!

03:51.024 --> 03:54.794
Look, I'm at the hospital.
Yeah, okay. Bye.

04:18.993 --> 04:22.923
Miss Hoover?
Your brother's fine.

04:23.023 --> 04:26.723
<i>I need you to keep him away
from sharp objects-knives, scissors.</i>

04:26.833 --> 04:31.023
<i>If you have medications, depressants
in your house, keep them secure.</i>

04:31.133 --> 04:35.592
<i>- I'd prefer to keep him, but-
- I know. The insurance.</i>

04:35.702 --> 04:37.762
You want to see him?

04:52.792 --> 04:54.692
Hey, Frank.

04:56.292 --> 04:58.192
Sheryl.

04:59.592 --> 05:02.122
I'm so glad you're still here.

05:05.301 --> 05:08.231
Well, that makes one of us.

05:08.331 --> 05:11.431
<i>A strong low pressure
system passed across New Mexico...</i>

05:11.541 --> 05:14.731
<i>bringing with it a little moisture
that will cool things off a bit.</i>

05:14.841 --> 05:18.241
<i>We may even see a five- to 10-degree drop
in temperatures in Albuquerque.</i>

05:18.341 --> 05:20.811
<i>There will be no significant
accumulations of rainfall-</i>

05:20.911 --> 05:23.041
Do you want to talk or no?

05:23.151 --> 05:26.711
<i>- Nearly nothing, but statewide 93%-
- No.</i>

05:38.660 --> 05:40.560
Hello?

05:40.670 --> 05:42.570
Anyone?

05:44.840 --> 05:48.030
Down here.
We have you with Dwayne.

05:52.780 --> 05:55.690
<i>Dwayne, hi.
Uncle Frank's here.</i>

05:59.030 --> 06:01.459
He doesn't mind, Frank.
We talked.

06:03.729 --> 06:08.469
<i>Wha- I know. I know. But we can't have you
sleeping alone. The doctor said.</i>

06:08.569 --> 06:11.669
I'm sorry.
I have to insist.

06:15.309 --> 06:17.749
You'll get along fine.
He's really quiet.

06:17.849 --> 06:20.439
<i>And here's your cot.</i>

06:24.319 --> 06:26.619
Please, Frank.

06:26.719 --> 06:28.989
Please.

06:32.928 --> 06:35.088
Thank you.

06:35.198 --> 06:37.098
I'm gonna start dinner.

06:37.198 --> 06:39.388
You can come out
when you're settled.

06:39.498 --> 06:43.698
And, uh, just leave the door open.
That's important.

06:53.748 --> 06:56.648
Dwayne, honey, there's
a bucket of chicken in the car.

06:56.748 --> 06:59.847
Can you get it?
And, uh, I'll make a salad.

06:59.957 --> 07:02.187
<i>- Olive?
- Yeah?</i>

07:02.287 --> 07:04.187
<i>- Is Grandpa with you?
- Yeah.</i>

07:04.287 --> 07:06.587
<i>- What are you guys doing?
- Rehearsing.</i>

07:06.697 --> 07:09.317
<i>- Okay, well, dinner in 10 minutes.
- Okay.</i>

07:11.127 --> 07:13.687
- Hi.
- Hi. Frank's here.

07:13.797 --> 07:16.927
Oh, God.
Did, uh, Stan Grossman call?

07:17.037 --> 07:19.507
<i>Well, check the machine.</i>

07:19.607 --> 07:22.937
- Dwayne, please, come on.
The chicken. It's in the car.

07:23.047 --> 07:25.567
Will you set the table?
We'll do paper plates tonight.

07:25.677 --> 07:28.646
<i>Remember Olive
was runner-up in the Little Miss Sunshine?</i>

07:28.746 --> 07:33.016
<i>- Theyjust called right now-
- Hey, it's your sister!</i>

07:33.116 --> 07:35.556
Fuck.

07:42.896 --> 07:46.626
Hi. Richard Hoover
for Stan Grossman, please.

07:46.736 --> 07:49.226
Any way to reach him or-

07:49.336 --> 07:52.566
<i>Well, I'm just wondering
if this darn book deal is done or not.</i>

07:52.676 --> 07:55.666
<i>If-</i>

07:55.776 --> 07:58.175
<i>Yes.</i>

07:58.275 --> 08:01.405
Okay, could you please just have him
call me anytime over the weekend?

08:01.515 --> 08:04.605
He has my cell number.
Just to let me know we're on.

08:04.715 --> 08:08.845
Okay? Thank you. Bye.

08:08.955 --> 08:11.475
- So what happened with Stan Grossman?
- He's in Scottsdale.

08:11.585 --> 08:13.815
<i>Why didn't he call?</i>

08:13.925 --> 08:16.685
Will you let me
worry about this, please?

08:16.795 --> 08:20.025
Dwayne, can you check on Frank?
Tell him it's dinnertime.

08:21.995 --> 08:24.625
<i>Olive! Dinnertime!</i>

08:24.734 --> 08:26.634
<i>Coming!</i>

08:29.974 --> 08:33.044
What? Dinner?

08:36.654 --> 08:39.094
What, you don't talk anymore?

08:40.424 --> 08:42.394
<i>Why not?</i>

08:42.494 --> 08:46.594
<i>You can talk.
You just choose not to?</i>

08:51.504 --> 08:53.434
<i>Is that Nietzsche?</i>

08:55.443 --> 08:58.743
You don't speak
because of Friedrich Nietzsche.

09:03.753 --> 09:06.153
Far out.

09:11.493 --> 09:16.053
<i>Frank, you can sit here next to Dwayne.</i>

09:16.163 --> 09:20.363
Here's the salad, and I'm gonna run
and get Sprite for everyone.

09:23.272 --> 09:25.362
<i>Olive, come on!
Dinnertime!</i>

09:25.472 --> 09:27.372
<i>Okay.</i>

09:33.682 --> 09:35.872
So who do you hang out with?

09:41.752 --> 09:43.912
No one?

09:54.961 --> 09:57.231
<i>What about your family?</i>

10:02.401 --> 10:04.531
<i>Frank! Hey!</i>

10:04.641 --> 10:08.701
- Richard.
- Good to... see you.

10:19.091 --> 10:21.680
Let me get Olive.

10:21.790 --> 10:25.160
<i>- Olive? Dad?
- You guys, go on and start.</i>

10:25.260 --> 10:27.350
<i>- Let's go!
- We're coming.</i>

10:27.460 --> 10:30.360
<i>- Frank, some Sprite?
- Yes.</i>

10:30.470 --> 10:33.400
<i>And I want everyone to have
at least a little salad.</i>

10:33.500 --> 10:35.730
Thanks, Sheryl.

10:35.840 --> 10:37.740
Honey.

10:41.740 --> 10:46.010
So, Sheryl, I couldn't help noticing
Dwayne has stopped speaking.

10:46.120 --> 10:49.239
Oh, yeah, he's taken a vow of silence.

10:49.349 --> 10:51.439
You've taken a vow of silence?

10:51.549 --> 10:54.389
<i>Yeah. He's gonna join the Air Force Academy,
become a test pilot...</i>

10:54.489 --> 10:57.479
and he's taken a vow of silence
until he reaches that goal.

10:57.589 --> 10:59.579
<i>- You're kidding?
- Hi, Uncle Frank.</i>

10:59.699 --> 11:02.889
Oh, hey, Olive.
Wow, you're gettin' big.

11:02.999 --> 11:05.689
<i>Almost like a real person.</i>

11:08.649 --> 11:11.579
- What happened to your arms?
- Olive.

11:11.679 --> 11:13.849
<i>That's all right.
I had a little accident. I'm okay.</i>

11:13.949 --> 11:16.249
- How's the, uh, routine coming, honey?
- It's good.

11:16.359 --> 11:18.258
Yeah? When are you
gonna show it to us?

11:18.358 --> 11:20.588
I don't know.
It's up to Grandpa.

11:20.688 --> 11:23.218
A couple of days.
It still needs work.

11:23.328 --> 11:27.028
What's that? Chicken?
Every night it's the fuckin' chicken!

11:27.128 --> 11:31.068
- Holy God Almighty! It is possible just once-
- Dad!

11:31.168 --> 11:34.228
We could get something to eat around here
that's not the goddamn fucking chicken?

11:34.338 --> 11:36.968
<i>- Hey, Dad! Dad!
- I'm just sayin'-</i>

11:37.078 --> 11:40.568
<i>- Christ.
- When you want to start cooking your own food, you're welcome.</i>

11:40.678 --> 11:44.808
- At Sunset Manor, you know- - If you like
Sunset Manor, you shouldn't have got kicked out.

11:44.918 --> 11:47.277
<i>For God's sakes.</i>

11:50.187 --> 11:53.347
So when did you start
with the vow?

11:54.587 --> 11:57.717
<i>Been nine months, Frank.
He hasn't said a word.</i>

11:57.827 --> 12:02.627
Not one. I think it shows
tremendous discipline.

12:02.737 --> 12:03.927
- Richard.
- I really do.

12:04.037 --> 12:06.867
Really. I think we could
learn something from Dwayne.

12:06.967 --> 12:10.307
Dwayne has a goal.
He has a dream.

12:10.407 --> 12:12.967
It may not be my dream,
may not be yours...

12:13.077 --> 12:16.406
but he's pursuing it with
great conviction and focus.

12:16.516 --> 12:18.416
In fact, I was thinking
about the nine steps-

12:18.516 --> 12:20.416
Oh, for crying out loud!

12:20.516 --> 12:24.476
And how Dwayne's utilizing seven of them
in his personal quest to self-fulfillment.

12:24.586 --> 12:25.986
Richard, please.

12:26.086 --> 12:28.076
Well, I'm just saying
I've come around.

12:28.186 --> 12:30.216
I think he could use our support.

12:32.126 --> 12:34.596
How did it happen?

12:34.696 --> 12:37.426
- How did what happen?
- Your accident.

12:37.536 --> 12:39.436
Honey, here.

12:39.536 --> 12:42.626
<i>Oh, no, it's okay.
Unless you object.</i>

12:42.736 --> 12:46.965
No, I'm pro-honesty here.
I just think, you know, it's up to you.

12:47.075 --> 12:49.705
Be my guest.

12:51.315 --> 12:54.875
Olive, um, Uncle Frank
didn't really have an accident.

12:54.985 --> 12:59.645
<i>What happened was he...
tried to kill himself.</i>

12:59.755 --> 13:03.155
<i>You did? Why?</i>

13:03.255 --> 13:06.195
I'm sorry. I don't think
this is an appropriate conversation.

13:06.295 --> 13:09.385
Honey, let's let Uncle Frank
finish his dinner, okay? Shh.

13:09.495 --> 13:12.395
Why did you want to kill yourself?

13:12.495 --> 13:14.994
<i>No, don't answer the question, Frank.</i>

13:15.104 --> 13:17.534
<i>- Richard! Richard!
- He's not gonna answer the question. Frank.</i>

13:17.634 --> 13:20.074
- I wanted to kill myself-
- Don't listen to him.

13:20.174 --> 13:22.304
<i>- I was very unhappy.
- He's sick in his head.</i>

13:22.404 --> 13:24.804
- Richard!
- I'm sorry! I don't think it's an appropriate conversation...

13:24.914 --> 13:27.074
- for a seven-year-old.
- She's gonna find out anyway.

13:27.184 --> 13:31.084
- Okay.
- Go on, Frank.

13:34.284 --> 13:36.514
Why were you unhappy?

13:36.624 --> 13:40.084
Um, well, there are a lot of reasons.

13:40.194 --> 13:45.103
Mainly, though, I fell in love
with someone who didn't love me back.

13:45.203 --> 13:46.763
Who?

13:46.873 --> 13:50.103
<i>One of my grad students.
I was very much in love with him.</i>

13:50.213 --> 13:52.583
Him?

13:52.683 --> 13:57.013
<i>It was a boy?
You fell in love with a boy?</i>

13:57.123 --> 14:00.243
- Yes, I did. Very much so.
- That's silly.

14:00.353 --> 14:03.053
<i>You're right. It was silly.
It was very, very silly.</i>

14:03.163 --> 14:06.223
- There's another word for it.
- Dad.

14:06.333 --> 14:10.233
<i>- So, that's when you tried to kill yourself?
- Well, no.</i>

14:10.333 --> 14:13.892
The boy that I was in love with fell in love
with another man- Larry Sugarman.

14:14.002 --> 14:16.262
- Who's Larry Sugarman?
- Larry Sugarman is, perhaps...

14:16.372 --> 14:19.532
the second most highly regarded
Proust scholar in the U.S.

14:19.642 --> 14:23.202
- Who's number one?
- That would be me, Rich.

14:23.312 --> 14:25.712
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

14:25.812 --> 14:27.942
So that's when.

14:28.052 --> 14:30.412
No. What happened was
I was a bit upset...

14:30.522 --> 14:32.812
so I said some things
that I shouldn't have said...

14:32.922 --> 14:35.052
<i>and I did some things
that I shouldn't have done...</i>

14:35.152 --> 14:37.212
and subsequently
I was fired from my job...

14:37.322 --> 14:40.491
<i>and forced to move out of my apartment
and move into a motel.</i>

14:44.261 --> 14:46.751
<i>- And that's when you tried to-
- Well, no.</i>

14:46.871 --> 14:49.061
Actually, all of that was okay.

14:49.171 --> 14:53.761
What happened was two days ago the
MacArthur Foundation, in its infinite wisdom...

14:53.871 --> 14:58.071
<i>awarded a genius grant
to Larry Sugarman.</i>

14:58.181 --> 15:00.441
And that's when I-

15:00.551 --> 15:03.141
<i>Decided to check out early.</i>

15:03.251 --> 15:06.811
Yes. Yes. And I failed
at that as well.

15:06.921 --> 15:10.910
<i>Olive, the important thing
to understand here...</i>

15:11.020 --> 15:13.250
<i>is that Uncle Frank
gave up on himself.</i>

15:13.360 --> 15:17.290
He made a series of foolish choices-
I'm sorry- and he gave up on himself...

15:17.400 --> 15:19.960
which is something winners never do.

15:20.070 --> 15:23.830
So that's the story, okay?
Now, everyone, just let's move on and, uh-

15:23.940 --> 15:28.100
<i>Is he always like this? How can you stand it?</i>

15:28.210 --> 15:32.110
Olive, tell him about your
routine while you're doing this.

15:32.210 --> 15:36.110
Okay. Little Miss Chili Pepper is
a beauty contest for everyone in Albuquerque...

15:36.220 --> 15:39.339
but you have to be six or seven
and you have to be a girl.

15:39.449 --> 15:41.609
This is our sister.

15:41.719 --> 15:43.279
- Cindy.
- Spring break.

15:43.389 --> 15:45.749
Dwayne went to see his dad
in Florida for two weeks...

15:45.859 --> 15:48.219
and Olive went to Laguna
to see her cousins.

15:48.329 --> 15:52.729
- She made it to the top of the regionals out there.
- I was in second place.

15:52.829 --> 15:54.819
Well, what do you think
your chances are?

15:54.929 --> 15:57.899
I think I can win,
because some of the other girls...

15:57.999 --> 16:01.399
<i>they've been doing it longer,
but I practice every day.</i>

16:01.509 --> 16:04.369
- Yeah. Good luck.
- Not about luck, Frank.

16:04.479 --> 16:06.968
<i>Luck is the name losers give
to their own failings.</i>

16:07.078 --> 16:09.908
It's about wanting to win,
willing yourself to win.

16:10.018 --> 16:12.708
- You've got to want it badder than anybody else.
- I do.

16:12.818 --> 16:15.148
<i>- Then you're gonna be a winner.
- Richard.</i>

16:15.248 --> 16:17.218
It's the truth.

16:17.888 --> 16:20.428
<i>You know, actually, there is a message
from Cindy on the machine.</i>

16:20.538 --> 16:22.598
Something about Little Mrs. Sunshine.

16:22.698 --> 16:26.068
<i>- What? Little Miss Sunshine?
- Yeah.</i>

16:26.168 --> 16:27.898
What?

16:31.978 --> 16:35.247
<i>Sheryl, it's Cindy.</i>

16:35.347 --> 16:37.247
Remember when Olive
was here last month?

16:37.347 --> 16:39.787
She was runner-up in the
regional Little Miss Sunshine?

16:39.887 --> 16:43.377
<i>Theyjust called right now and said that
the girl who won had to forfeit her crown.</i>

16:43.487 --> 16:46.387
I don't know why.
Something about diet pills.

16:46.497 --> 16:49.947
- Now she has a place in the state
contest in Redondo Beach!

16:53.197 --> 16:55.357
Oh, my gosh! I won!
I won! I won! I won!

16:55.467 --> 16:57.367
<i>- Finish your dinner!
- I'm finished!</i>

16:57.467 --> 17:00.097
- What happened?
- I'm just calling to- Cindy!

17:00.207 --> 17:04.435
Yeah, we just got it.
Yeah, she basically went crazy.

17:04.546 --> 17:07.205
<i>- I won! I won! I won!
- No, I didn't get that.</i>

17:07.316 --> 17:11.476
<i>The machine cut you off. Okay.</i>

17:11.586 --> 17:14.986
<i>Redondo Beach. This Sunday?</i>

17:15.086 --> 17:19.146
<i>- Wh-Are you guys going?
- Yes.</i>

17:19.256 --> 17:22.386
- Can you put it off?
- They have to. They have to.

17:22.496 --> 17:25.126
- Where does that leave us?
- We can't do it. We can't.

17:25.226 --> 17:27.955
No, no- No, I understand
that, Cindy. Yeah.

17:28.066 --> 17:31.556
- They- - I just- No, I'll just
figure it out. Okay, bye-bye.

17:31.666 --> 17:34.605
It's this Sunday?
Why can'tJeff and Cindy take her?

17:34.705 --> 17:36.735
They have some equestrian
thing in Santa Barbara.

17:36.845 --> 17:39.575
You know, they do that horse
shit every single weekend.

17:39.675 --> 17:43.335
Well, it's the nationals. They're taking
both horses, so apparently it's a big deal.

17:43.445 --> 17:45.935
What about Olive?

17:47.555 --> 17:51.185
Little Miss Sunshine!
Little Miss Sunshine! I won!

17:51.285 --> 17:53.485
I won!

17:53.595 --> 17:55.685
I'm going! We're going!

17:55.795 --> 17:58.195
- You promised?
- We'll fly out and come back Monday.

17:58.295 --> 18:00.765
- How are you gonna get around out there?
- We'll rent a car.

18:00.865 --> 18:03.354
- And stay at a hotel?
- We can afford it.

18:03.464 --> 18:06.694
- This is our seed money.
- Well, if I had a little help bringin' it in.

18:06.804 --> 18:09.104
- Don't start that.
- It all goes to your nine steps!

18:09.204 --> 18:11.534
I told you I'm gonna talk
to Stan Grossman!

18:11.644 --> 18:15.204
We're gonna get locked and loaded on this
deal and start generating some income!

18:15.314 --> 18:18.214
<i>- But in the meantime we've gotta be-
- Okay, okay! We'll drive!</i>

18:18.314 --> 18:21.404
- I'm not drivin'.
- How are you gonna fit Grandpa in the Miata?

18:21.514 --> 18:24.314
<i>- Well, Grandpa does not have to come.
- What? I coached her!</i>

18:24.424 --> 18:26.684
I gave her the moves.
I gotta go.

18:26.794 --> 18:29.983
- Why don't you take the V. W?
- I cannot drive a shift. I tried.

18:30.093 --> 18:32.493
<i>- We'll fly there.
- We can't afford it.</i>

18:32.593 --> 18:37.223
Well, that's what we're gonna do
unless you have a better idea.

18:37.333 --> 18:39.633
Here. This is dessert.

18:43.003 --> 18:45.663
<i>I won! I won!
I won! I won! I won!</i>

18:45.773 --> 18:48.243
I won! I won! I won!

18:52.843 --> 18:56.553
<i>Miss Sunshine! Little Miss Sunshine!
Little Miss Sunshine!</i>

18:56.663 --> 18:58.682
All right.
I'll drive the bus.

18:58.792 --> 19:02.562
Richard, I was told explicitly
not to leave Frank by himself.

19:02.662 --> 19:04.562
- No offense, Frank.
- None taken.

19:04.672 --> 19:07.162
You got Dwayne here.
They can look after each other.

19:07.272 --> 19:10.242
No, Richard! That's asking too much.
If something happened-

19:10.342 --> 19:13.872
We can't go, then, unless
Dwayne and Frank go with us.

19:13.982 --> 19:17.932
<i>- Mom, where's my bathing suit?
- Right.</i>

19:19.352 --> 19:21.212
Frank?

19:21.322 --> 19:23.652
<i>I found it!</i>

19:23.752 --> 19:25.652
Okay.

19:27.122 --> 19:29.221
<i>I'm going! I'm going!
I'm going!</i>

19:29.321 --> 19:33.091
Oh, Dwayne, come on, please.
Think of your sister.

19:33.201 --> 19:37.061
<i>Come on, Dwayne.
It'll be a lot of fun.</i>

19:37.171 --> 19:39.631
<i>You can go to the beach and-</i>

19:43.171 --> 19:46.271
<i>"This is unfair.</i>

19:46.371 --> 19:50.671
"All I ask is...

19:50.781 --> 19:54.151
<i>that you leave me alone. "</i>

19:57.950 --> 20:00.150
Dwayne, flight school.

20:00.260 --> 20:03.660
I will give you permission
for flight school.

20:03.760 --> 20:08.920
<i>I won! I won! I won! I won!
I'm gonna win this one too!</i>

20:17.370 --> 20:21.500
"But I'm not going...

20:21.610 --> 20:24.770
to have any fun. "

20:24.880 --> 20:27.579
<i>Yeah, we're all with you
on that one, Dwayne.</i>

20:27.679 --> 20:30.239
Grandpa! Grandpa!
Is Grandpa coming to California?

20:30.349 --> 20:33.009
<i>- We're all coming, honey.
- Hey, uh, hold on.</i>

20:33.119 --> 20:35.109
Olive, come over here
for a second.

20:35.219 --> 20:37.689
<i>Come here.
Sit down for a second.</i>

20:37.789 --> 20:42.249
Look, there's no sense
in entering a contest...

20:42.359 --> 20:44.629
if you don't think
you're gonna win.

20:44.729 --> 20:49.299
So do you think you can win
Little Miss Sunshine?

20:49.399 --> 20:52.169
<i>Richard-</i>

20:52.269 --> 20:54.998
Are you gonna win?

20:59.048 --> 21:00.208
Yes!

21:00.318 --> 21:04.878
We're going to California.

21:11.688 --> 21:13.748
Good night, Dwayne.

21:30.887 --> 21:33.977
<i>Not on your watch.
I wouldn't do that to you.</i>

21:42.727 --> 21:45.327
<i>Thank you, Dwayne.</i>

21:46.637 --> 21:50.007
Coming from you,
that means a lot.

21:50.107 --> 21:52.006
Good night.

22:43.355 --> 22:47.125
Jesus, I'm tired.
I'm so fucking tired.

22:47.225 --> 22:49.125
Do you know how tired I am?

22:49.224 --> 22:52.664
If some girl came up to me,
begged me to fuck her, I couldn't do it.

22:52.764 --> 22:56.094
<i>- Dad? Watch the language, huh?
- That's how tired I am.</i>

22:56.204 --> 22:58.174
She's listening to music.

22:58.274 --> 23:00.964
Olive, I'll give you a million dollars
if you turn around.

23:01.074 --> 23:03.064
<i>- See?
- All right.</i>

23:03.174 --> 23:05.264
<i>- But the rest of us.
- Oh, the rest of you.</i>

23:05.374 --> 23:08.074
Can I give you some advice?

23:08.184 --> 23:11.174
Well, I'm gonna
give it to you anyway.

23:11.284 --> 23:15.484
- I don't want you making the same mistakes I made.
- Can't wait to hear this.

23:15.584 --> 23:18.523
Dwayne-That's your name,
right? Dwayne?

23:18.623 --> 23:21.523
<i>This is the voice
of experience talking.</i>

23:21.623 --> 23:24.683
<i>Are you listening?
Fuck a lot of women, Dwayne.</i>

23:24.793 --> 23:28.023
<i>- Hey! Dad!
- Not just one woman. A lot of women.</i>

23:28.133 --> 23:30.293
<i>- That's enough, all right?
- Are you gettin' any?</i>

23:30.403 --> 23:33.203
<i>- Dad!
- You can tell me, Dwayne. Are you gettin' any?</i>

23:33.303 --> 23:36.333
<i>- Come on, please.
- No? Jesus. You're what, 15?</i>

23:36.443 --> 23:38.773
<i>- My God, man!
- Dad!</i>

23:38.873 --> 23:42.273
<i>You should be gettin'that young stuff.
That young stuff is the best in the world.</i>

23:42.383 --> 23:45.113
- Dad, that's enough! Stop it!
- Will you kindly not interrupt!

23:45.213 --> 23:48.512
See, right now you're jailbait.
They're jailbait. It's perfect.

23:48.622 --> 23:52.382
I mean, you hit 18- Man, you're
talking about three to five.

23:52.492 --> 23:54.462
Hey, I will pull
this truck over right now!

23:54.562 --> 23:57.892
So pull the truck over!
Fuck you! I can say what I want.

23:57.992 --> 24:00.892
- I still got Nazi bullets in my ass!
- Ah, the Nazi bullets!

24:01.002 --> 24:04.992
You're as bad as those fuckers at Sunset Manor.

24:05.102 --> 24:08.172
- What happened at Sunset Manor?
- Frank, don't encourage him.

24:08.282 --> 24:11.412
<i>I'll tell you what happened.
I paid my money. They took my money.</i>

24:11.522 --> 24:14.212
I should be able to do
what the fuck I want!

24:14.322 --> 24:17.221
- He started snorting heroin.
- You started snorting heroin?

24:17.321 --> 24:19.311
- I'm old!
- Well, that stuff'll kill you.

24:19.421 --> 24:22.521
What am I, an idiot?
And don't you start taking that shit.

24:22.631 --> 24:24.821
When you're young,
you're crazy to do that stuff.

24:24.931 --> 24:28.021
- What about you?
- I'm old. When you're old, you're crazy not to do it.

24:28.131 --> 24:32.091
<i>We've tried. Believe me. The intervention
was a fiasco. He's worse than a two-year-old.</i>

24:32.201 --> 24:35.101
Can we please talk
about something else?

24:35.211 --> 24:38.401
<i>- I take it you didn't like it at Sunset Manor.
- Frank.</i>

24:38.511 --> 24:40.771
Are you kidding me?
It was a fuckin' paradise.

24:40.881 --> 24:42.941
They got a pool.
They got golf.

24:43.051 --> 24:46.180
Now I'm stuck with Mr. Happy here,
sleepin' on a fuckin' sofa.

24:46.280 --> 24:50.280
<i>Look, I know you're a homo and all,
but maybe you can appreciate this.</i>

24:50.390 --> 24:53.950
You go to one of those places,
there's four women for every guy.

24:54.060 --> 24:56.430
- Can you imagine what that's like?
- You must've been very busy.

24:56.530 --> 24:59.860
Whoa! I had second-degree burns
on my johnson. I kid you not.

24:59.960 --> 25:01.960
<i>- Really?
- Forget about it.</i>

25:02.070 --> 25:04.040
What are you guys
talking about?

25:04.140 --> 25:06.070
Politics.

25:06.170 --> 25:08.700
Oh.

25:10.840 --> 25:13.869
Fuck a lot of women, kid.
I have no reason to lie to you.

25:13.979 --> 25:17.139
Not one woman.
A lot of women.

25:18.849 --> 25:22.049
<i>You heard what I said?
Did it go in anywhere?</i>

25:22.149 --> 25:24.049
Yeah, I think
we get the point, Dad.

25:24.159 --> 25:26.949
Don't show me the pad.
I don't want to see the fuckin' pad.

25:30.559 --> 25:32.759
Mom, how much can we spend?

25:32.859 --> 25:36.629
<i>I would say four dollars.
Anything under four dollars.</i>

25:36.729 --> 25:38.929
Hi. You ready?

25:39.039 --> 25:42.268
Yeah, I'm gonna have the,
uh, number five with coffee, please.

25:42.368 --> 25:44.268
<i>All right.</i>

25:44.378 --> 25:47.108
A number seven, over easy,
and a grapefruit juice.

25:47.208 --> 25:50.978
- Grapefruit. Okay.
- I would like a fruit plate.

25:51.078 --> 25:53.018
<i>- And do you have chamomile?
- Yes.</i>

25:53.118 --> 25:56.778
<i>- With honey, please.
- I would like the lumberjack and coffee.</i>

25:56.888 --> 26:00.188
<i>- And extra bacon.
- Extra.</i>

26:00.288 --> 26:02.518
- Now, Dad, you should probably-
- Richard, don't start.

26:02.628 --> 26:04.528
- He's gonna kill himself.
- Well, it's his life.

26:04.628 --> 26:06.618
<i>- Thank you, Sheryl.
- Garden salad?</i>

26:06.728 --> 26:08.598
And you.

26:08.698 --> 26:12.097
<i>- L- I'm sorry. I, um- Sorry.
- Take your time.</i>

26:12.197 --> 26:14.827
<i>Don't apologize, Olive.
It's a sign of weakness.</i>

26:14.937 --> 26:18.597
<i>Um, well, I want- Okay, okay.
I know what I want. I know.</i>

26:18.707 --> 26:22.937
Okay, can I get
the waffles and, uh-

26:23.047 --> 26:25.877
I don't-
What does "alamodey" mean?

26:25.977 --> 26:29.077
- Oh, that means it comes with ice cream.
- Okay, "alamodey" then.

26:29.187 --> 26:32.677
<i>- Olive, for breakfast?
- You said four dollars.</i>

26:32.787 --> 26:35.657
Okay. You're right.
Thank you.

26:35.757 --> 26:37.387
Okay. Be right back.

26:37.497 --> 26:40.586
<i>Actually, Olive,
"à la mode"in French...</i>

26:40.696 --> 26:44.296
translates literally
as "in the fashion. "

26:44.406 --> 26:46.536
À la mode.

26:46.646 --> 26:50.576
<i>"Mode"is derived from Latin modus,
meaning "due or proper measure. "</i>

26:50.686 --> 26:52.946
<i>- Frank, shut up.
- Richard!</i>

26:53.046 --> 26:55.776
<i>Olive, can I tell you a little
something about ice cream?</i>

26:55.886 --> 26:58.616
<i>- Yeah.
- Well, ice cream is made from cream...</i>

26:58.726 --> 27:00.586
which comes from cow's milk...

27:00.696 --> 27:03.386
and cream has a lot of fat in it.

27:03.496 --> 27:05.396
- Richard.
- What?

27:05.496 --> 27:09.225
- She's gonna find out anyway, remember?
- What? Find out what?

27:09.335 --> 27:14.265
Well, when you eat ice cream, the fat
in the ice cream becomes fat in your body.

27:14.375 --> 27:16.565
<i>- Richard, I swear to God-
- It's true.</i>

27:16.675 --> 27:19.075
- What? What's wrong?
- Nothing, honey. Nothing's wrong.

27:19.175 --> 27:23.135
So if you eat a lot of ice cream,
you might become fat.

27:23.245 --> 27:27.085
And if you don't, you're gonna
stay nice and skinny, sweetie.

27:27.185 --> 27:30.175
- Mom-
- Olive, Richard is an idiot.

27:30.285 --> 27:32.555
I like a woman
with meat on her bones.

27:32.655 --> 27:34.625
<i>I don't- Why's everyone so upset?</i>

27:34.725 --> 27:37.125
<i>No, no one's upset, honey. L-</i>

27:37.225 --> 27:39.284
I just want you to understand...

27:39.394 --> 27:43.524
it's okay to be skinny, and it's okay
to be fat, if that's what you want to be.

27:43.634 --> 27:45.894
Whatever you want, it's okay.

27:46.004 --> 27:48.904
<i>Okay, but, Olive,
let me ask you this.</i>

27:49.004 --> 27:51.804
Those women in Miss America-

27:51.904 --> 27:56.204
Are they skinny,
or are they fat?

27:58.014 --> 28:00.104
<i>Honey?</i>

28:00.214 --> 28:03.944
<i>Well, they're skinny, I guess.</i>

28:04.054 --> 28:06.813
<i>Yeah. I guess they don't
eat a lot of ice cream.</i>

28:06.923 --> 28:11.293
<i>Okay. Coffee. Coffee.</i>

28:12.523 --> 28:14.753
- Grapefruit.
- Thank you.

28:14.863 --> 28:18.923
Chamomile.
And here's your ice cream.

28:19.033 --> 28:22.593
"Alamodey," right? I'll be back
with your waffles in a second.

28:25.943 --> 28:28.103
Does anyone want my ice cream?

28:28.213 --> 28:31.573
<i>Yeah, I'd like a little.
Dwayne? Frank?</i>

28:31.683 --> 28:34.912
- Olive's not gonna have her ice cream.
- Do you mind if I have a little?

28:35.012 --> 28:37.282
- Yeah, let's dig in.
- That looks really good.

28:37.382 --> 28:39.852
<i>Boy, I feel sorry for anybody...</i>

28:39.952 --> 28:42.612
that doesn't want to enjoy their ice cream
so early in the morning.

28:42.722 --> 28:45.422
<i>- Boy, that looks good.
- You sure you don't wanna have some, Olive?</i>

28:45.522 --> 28:47.652
<i>Those waffles are gonna be
awful lonely in there.</i>

28:47.762 --> 28:50.322
- Mmm! Mmm!
- Watch this.

28:50.432 --> 28:53.662
Wait! Stop!
Don't eat it all.

28:58.702 --> 29:00.972
- All right, Olive-
- Richard!

29:04.881 --> 29:07.541
Hey, Stan!

29:07.651 --> 29:11.101
Stan, it's Richard. Again.
Listen, I know you're busy...

29:11.221 --> 29:15.121
but we're just dying to hear what sort
of numbers you came up with in Scottsdale.

29:15.221 --> 29:18.691
- So, uh, give me a call, please.
- Hey, did you get him?

29:18.801 --> 29:22.001
No, I can't get a signal out of this thing.

29:23.811 --> 29:25.901
<i>How long till we get there?</i>

29:26.011 --> 29:28.601
- A long time, honey.
- I know. But how long?

29:28.711 --> 29:32.740
Well, we gotta do 600 miles of driving
today and 200 tomorrow.

29:32.850 --> 29:35.580
- That's a lot of driving. Let's go.
- I'll drive for a while.

29:35.680 --> 29:38.480
- No, no. I got it.
- No. I gotta learn how to do this.

29:38.590 --> 29:40.580
You're doing it.
How hard can it be?

29:43.790 --> 29:46.590
- Push the stick down hard.
- I'm pushing hard.

29:46.690 --> 29:49.090
<i>Okay. Okay, there you go.</i>

29:49.200 --> 29:51.760
Now push the clutch in
all the way to the floor.

29:51.870 --> 29:56.240
It's on the floor.
The floor.

30:03.109 --> 30:05.939
Sticking on there.

30:06.049 --> 30:08.909
Push down hard.

30:12.049 --> 30:15.079
Well, you've got a problem.

30:15.189 --> 30:18.279
Your clutch is, uh, shot.

30:18.389 --> 30:20.689
Can we get a new one?

30:20.799 --> 30:24.289
<i>These old buses, you-
you have to order the part.</i>

30:24.399 --> 30:26.959
How long does it take?

30:27.069 --> 30:29.299
Well, it's the weekend...

30:29.399 --> 30:34.638
so... maybe... Thursday.

30:48.658 --> 30:54.148
Is there a, uh,
dealership around here?

30:54.258 --> 30:56.918
Well, uh, they're
probably gonna be closed.

30:57.028 --> 30:58.968
It's, uh-
It's the weekend, you know.

30:59.067 --> 31:01.827
Yes, we're aware of that.

31:01.937 --> 31:05.997
I'll tell you what.
You know these- these old buses?

31:06.107 --> 31:10.977
You don't need the clutch to change from-
from the third to the fourth.

31:11.077 --> 31:15.107
You only really need the clutch to go
from number one to number two.

31:15.217 --> 31:18.577
<i>But as long as you keep
parking on a hill...</i>

31:18.687 --> 31:22.777
<i>and you let it go, and it goes
15, 20 miles per hour...</i>

31:22.887 --> 31:25.647
you start her in third,
and you go from third to fourth.

31:25.757 --> 31:28.816
What if you're not
on a hill? There's no hill.

31:28.926 --> 31:31.156
What if there's no hill?
What do you-

31:31.266 --> 31:33.526
Yeah, it's-

31:39.266 --> 31:42.966
Olive, Dad, I want you
in the car first.

31:43.076 --> 31:45.806
- I know. We know.
- All right, here we go!

31:48.116 --> 31:51.276
Everybody push!
All right.

31:51.386 --> 31:55.486
<i>Here we go! Push! Push!</i>

31:55.596 --> 31:59.295
Ok- Ok- Okay!

31:59.395 --> 32:02.065
I just want everyone here to know...

32:02.165 --> 32:04.695
that I am the preeminent
Proust scholar in the United States.

32:04.805 --> 32:07.235
<i>Here we go!</i>

32:07.345 --> 32:09.305
<i>- Go on, honey.
- I'm putting it in gear!</i>

32:09.405 --> 32:11.965
<i>- Go, honey!
- Come on!</i>

32:12.075 --> 32:13.975
Come on, Olive!
Run! Run! Come on!

32:14.085 --> 32:15.985
- Come on!
- Sheryl, let's go!

32:16.085 --> 32:19.215
Sheryl!

32:22.425 --> 32:24.255
<i>- Frank, let's go!
- I'm coming.</i>

32:24.355 --> 32:27.194
<i>- You're losing them. Slow down!
- I can't slow down!</i>

32:27.294 --> 32:30.624
- Come on! Come on! Come on, you dumb bastard!
- I can't. I can't slow down.

32:30.734 --> 32:33.094
- I can't slow down!
- Let's go!

32:33.194 --> 32:35.864
<i>Help him. Come on!</i>

32:35.964 --> 32:38.734
Come on. Come on. Get in.

32:38.834 --> 32:42.174
No one gets left behind.

32:42.274 --> 32:44.534
- Close the door!
- No one gets left behind!

32:44.644 --> 32:47.344
Outstanding, soldier!
Outstanding!

32:52.814 --> 32:55.213
Outstanding.

32:55.323 --> 32:57.513
- Was that fun?
- Yeah.

33:47.102 --> 33:49.732
<i>So finally I'm just sitting there...</i>

33:49.842 --> 33:52.771
and I decide, you know,
"This is Stan Grossman. What the hell?"

33:52.871 --> 33:55.241
And I start pitching him
the nine steps.

33:55.341 --> 33:59.071
<i>And about- I don't know-
two minutes in, he stops me, he says...</i>

33:59.181 --> 34:01.581
"I can sell this. "

34:01.681 --> 34:03.581
<i>Mm-hmm. Interesting.</i>

34:03.681 --> 34:06.281
Yeah, and this is the guy
who knows how to do it.

34:06.391 --> 34:11.091
You start with a book, and then you do a media
tour, corporate events, DVD, VHS series.

34:11.190 --> 34:14.960
<i>I mean, there's a whole fascinating science
into how you roll these things out.</i>

34:15.061 --> 34:18.261
<i>- Wow.
- Yeah, so he's in Scottsdale right now, you know...</i>

34:18.371 --> 34:22.030
<i>building the buzz and kind of getting
the whole hype thing going.</i>

34:22.139 --> 34:25.370
<i>He's doing what the pros call
a ticking clock auction.</i>

34:25.469 --> 34:28.540
Oh, how about that!

34:31.989 --> 34:35.949
Yeah, and I can detect
that note of sarcasm there, Frank.

34:36.060 --> 34:38.860
What sarcasm? I didn't-
I didn't hear it.

34:38.960 --> 34:40.989
But I want you
to know something.

34:41.100 --> 34:43.000
I feel sorry for you.

34:43.100 --> 34:45.030
You do? Good.

34:45.139 --> 34:48.370
<i>Yeah, I do. Because sarcasm
is the refuge oflosers.</i>

34:48.469 --> 34:50.909
<i>- It is? Really?
- Yep.</i>

34:51.009 --> 34:54.409
Sarcasm is losers trying to bring
winners down to their level...

34:54.509 --> 34:56.039
and that's step four in the program.

34:56.149 --> 34:58.879
Wow, Richard, you've really opened
my eyes to what a loser I am.

34:58.979 --> 35:02.209
- How much do I owe you for those pearls of wisdom?
- That one's on the house.

35:02.319 --> 35:05.149
<i>- Okay, you guys, that's enough.
- It's on the house.</i>

35:05.259 --> 35:07.419
- That was for free?
- No charge. No charge.

35:07.529 --> 35:09.859
- Stop it!
- He started it.

35:09.959 --> 35:12.359
<i>That's- Oh, wait a second.</i>

35:12.459 --> 35:15.229
<i>- You are so bad.
- Quiet. This is it. This is that call.</i>

35:15.329 --> 35:17.429
He-Hello?

35:17.539 --> 35:19.898
Stan?

35:19.998 --> 35:21.898
Stan?

35:29.548 --> 35:32.738
Stan Grossman?
Richard Hoover.

35:32.848 --> 35:35.818
Finally. How're ya doin'?

35:35.918 --> 35:39.118
No, I know. We were, uh, on the highway,
and I lost you on my cell.

35:39.218 --> 35:41.348
Forget about it.
How'd we do?

35:48.297 --> 35:50.957
Honey, I'm gonna use the ladies' room.
You need to go?

35:51.067 --> 35:53.897
No. I'm gonna go practice
my routine over there.

35:53.997 --> 35:55.967
Okay, well, don't go too far.

35:56.067 --> 35:59.197
<i>Well, I think that wejust
gotta talk to him a little.</i>

35:59.307 --> 36:01.297
No, you gotta talk to him.

36:01.407 --> 36:04.307
<i>No, Stan, listen to me.
Hold on now.</i>

36:04.417 --> 36:06.847
<i>I am going to get something to drink.
You want anything?</i>

36:06.947 --> 36:10.407
<i>- Stay positive and-
- Yeah, get me some porn.</i>

36:10.517 --> 36:12.417
Okay.

36:12.517 --> 36:15.917
Get me something really nasty too.
I don't want any of that airbrushed shit.

36:16.026 --> 36:18.926
- Okay.
- Okay, here's a 20. Get yourself a little treat too.

36:19.026 --> 36:22.586
- Get yourself a fag rag.
- All right. I will.

36:25.236 --> 36:28.326
<i>Uh, that one. Yes. And that one.</i>

36:28.436 --> 36:31.766
And I would like
that one- No, down.

36:31.876 --> 36:35.436
Yes. Yes. Yes.
I would like that one.

36:35.546 --> 36:38.236
And, uh, I will have a-

36:38.346 --> 36:41.106
a blue raspberry Slushee.

36:41.216 --> 36:43.236
Frank?

36:43.346 --> 36:46.115
<i>Oh, my God! How are you?</i>

36:46.215 --> 36:49.115
- Uh- - I thought you were gonna
be in Santa Fe for the conference.

36:49.225 --> 36:51.125
<i>I was looking for you.</i>

36:51.225 --> 36:53.955
<i>- Aren't you supposed to be in New Haven?
- Yeah.</i>

36:54.055 --> 36:57.185
- Well, you heard about Larry and the whole genius thing, right?
- Yeah.

36:57.295 --> 36:59.765
- It's official.
- Oh, good.

36:59.865 --> 37:02.455
So we're going to this private
spa in Sedona for the week-

37:02.565 --> 37:04.545
- Larry's here?
- Yeah.

37:04.645 --> 37:08.775
- He's out filling the tank. He's, uh-
- Oh. Yeah, there he is.

37:08.885 --> 37:12.375
Wow. I can't believe this.
How have you been?

37:12.485 --> 37:15.384
I've been fine.

37:15.494 --> 37:17.394
Good. Good.

37:17.494 --> 37:22.124
You know, I heard
that you got fired.

37:22.234 --> 37:24.724
Yeah. No, I quit, 'cause
enough is enough, you know?

37:24.834 --> 37:27.204
Right. Good. Good.

37:27.304 --> 37:30.064
So what are you up to now?

37:30.174 --> 37:33.144
Um, I'm weighing my options...

37:33.244 --> 37:38.734
and, um, just, you know,
taking some time off, and so-

37:38.844 --> 37:40.904
Great. That's great.

37:41.014 --> 37:43.613
<i>$ 19.79, sir.</i>

37:46.783 --> 37:48.383
So-

37:51.823 --> 37:54.663
- Well, it was great to see you.
- Yeah, you too.

37:54.763 --> 37:57.093
- Take care of yourself.
- You too.

37:57.193 --> 37:58.663
<i>Bye.</i>

38:27.022 --> 38:29.192
<i>Hey.</i>

38:29.292 --> 38:31.262
<i>You forgot your Slushee.</i>

38:33.962 --> 38:36.232
You're in Scottsdale right now, right?

38:36.332 --> 38:38.232
Okay, I can come by.

38:38.342 --> 38:41.461
I'm gonna be coming through there.
I could swing right by. We could-

38:43.711 --> 38:46.441
Christ.
He's not getting it.

38:48.851 --> 38:51.081
<i>Did you try that?</i>

38:51.181 --> 38:54.451
<i>Listen to what
I'm saying, Stan! I'll-I'll-</i>

39:00.161 --> 39:02.321
So what happened?

39:02.431 --> 39:04.551
Nothing.
Let's get out of here.

39:04.661 --> 39:07.461
Wait a minute. I thought
you said this was a done deal.

39:07.561 --> 39:10.500
- He said it was a done deal.
- What, you didn't get anything?

39:10.600 --> 39:12.570
Oh, my God!
Where does that leave us?

39:12.670 --> 39:14.570
Fucked.
That's where it leaves us.

39:14.670 --> 39:18.230
- I can't believe I'm hearing- Did you even
try negotiating? - Yes! Of course I tried!

39:18.340 --> 39:20.640
What do you think I-

39:20.740 --> 39:23.740
Let's just go, okay?
Let's go. Let's go.

39:23.850 --> 39:25.750
Come on.

39:29.120 --> 39:31.020
Let's go!

40:08.898 --> 40:10.798
"Where's Olive?"

40:12.668 --> 40:14.568
Oh!

40:23.248 --> 40:25.808
<i>All right, Frank.</i>

40:25.918 --> 40:27.718
- Come on, Olive.
- Come on, Olive.

40:27.818 --> 40:30.018
Come on, sweetie, jump.
Jump in the car.

40:30.118 --> 40:32.718
- We can't stop. Jump.
- I got her! I got her!

40:53.507 --> 40:55.737
Richard.

40:57.077 --> 40:58.977
Yeah.

40:59.087 --> 41:02.947
Whatever happens, you tried
to do something on your own...

41:03.057 --> 41:05.716
which is more than
most people ever do...

41:05.826 --> 41:08.446
and I include myself
in that category.

41:09.996 --> 41:14.426
You took a big chance.
That took guts, and I'm proud of you.

41:17.066 --> 41:19.796
Okay, Dad.
Thank you.

41:30.116 --> 41:32.016
Thank you, Dad.

42:05.114 --> 42:08.274
<i>Okay, here is 11.</i>

42:08.384 --> 42:10.474
Frank, you're 12.

42:12.824 --> 42:14.784
And Grandpa's 13.

42:14.894 --> 42:16.804
Can I sleep with Grandpa tonight?

42:16.904 --> 42:18.964
Well, you'll have to ask Grandpa.

42:19.074 --> 42:21.434
- Grandpa?
- I got two beds.

42:21.544 --> 42:23.534
You could still use some rehearsing.

42:23.644 --> 42:25.804
<i>Yeah, that's what I was thinking.</i>

42:32.083 --> 42:35.013
All right, everybody,
we have a long day tomorrow.

42:35.123 --> 42:38.053
I'll knock on your doors at 7:00 a. m.

42:38.153 --> 42:40.713
That means no lollygagging.

42:40.823 --> 42:43.483
We need to be packed
and on the road by 7:40, guys.

42:43.593 --> 42:45.963
- Frank, you guys'll be okay?
- Yeah, we're fine.

42:46.063 --> 42:47.963
- Okay, well, good night.
- Good night.

42:48.063 --> 42:50.663
- Sleep tight.
- Okay.

43:07.582 --> 43:09.672
What a fucking nightmare.

43:11.792 --> 43:14.082
Richard, we-
we have to talk.

43:14.192 --> 43:16.092
Please.

43:16.192 --> 43:21.692
Sheryl, let's just
get through this and go home.

43:21.802 --> 43:24.092
<i>No, Richard, we have to talk now!</i>

43:24.202 --> 43:26.962
<i>I tried to tell you
we couldn't afford this trip!</i>

43:27.072 --> 43:30.061
<i>- Do you realize we're becoming bankrupt?
- We are not bankrupt!</i>

43:30.171 --> 43:33.731
<i>Hey, don't listen to that.</i>

43:33.841 --> 43:36.241
Let's turn on the tube.

43:36.341 --> 43:40.441
<i>- We agree that the right man to preserve
the traditions- - I'm gonna brush my teeth.</i>

43:40.551 --> 43:43.181
Secretary Rumsfeld and I
thought long and hard...

43:43.281 --> 43:45.381
<i>about this important choice.</i>

43:45.491 --> 43:47.391
To me-

43:47.491 --> 43:50.321
<i>You said this was a lock!
You said it was a done deal!</i>

43:50.421 --> 43:52.791
<i>Stan Grossman said it was a done deal!</i>

43:52.891 --> 43:54.991
<i>I'm not married to Stan Grossman!</i>

43:55.101 --> 43:58.330
<i>I trusted him! You gotta trust
to be trusted! That's step six!</i>

43:58.430 --> 44:00.830
<i>Oh, fuck the nine steps, Richard!</i>

44:00.930 --> 44:03.270
<i>They're not working!
Forget it! It's over!</i>

44:03.370 --> 44:06.530
<i>I never want to hear
about the nine steps again!</i>

44:15.550 --> 44:18.380
Perfect. Perfect. You're
the world champion growler.

44:18.490 --> 44:21.050
Time for your beauty rest.
Get in there.

44:27.529 --> 44:29.499
There you go.

44:30.759 --> 44:32.659
Good night.

44:32.769 --> 44:35.829
<i>- Grandpa?
- Yeah.</i>

44:35.939 --> 44:39.059
I'm kinda scared about tomorrow.

44:39.169 --> 44:41.829
Are you kiddin' me?
You're gonna blow 'em out of the water.

44:41.939 --> 44:44.209
They're not gonna know
what hit 'em.

44:44.309 --> 44:47.249
<i>- Grandpa?
- Yeah.</i>

44:48.519 --> 44:50.419
Am I pretty?

44:50.519 --> 44:54.928
<i>Olive, you are...</i>

44:55.028 --> 44:57.428
the most beautiful girl
in the whole world.

44:57.528 --> 44:59.868
Nah, you're just saying that.

44:59.968 --> 45:01.958
No, I'm not. I'm madly
in love with you.

45:02.068 --> 45:04.868
And it's not because of your brains
or your personality.

45:04.978 --> 45:08.308
It's because you're
beautiful, inside and out.

45:09.778 --> 45:12.108
- Grandpa?
- What?

45:15.818 --> 45:18.808
- I don't want to be a loser.
- You're not a loser.

45:18.918 --> 45:21.718
Where'd you get the idea
you're a loser?

45:21.828 --> 45:25.157
Because Daddy hates losers.

45:25.257 --> 45:27.557
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Back up a minute.

45:27.657 --> 45:29.557
You know what a loser is?

45:29.667 --> 45:35.467
A real loser is somebody that's so afraid
of not winning, they don't even try.

45:35.567 --> 45:39.407
- Now, you're trying, right?
- Yeah.

45:39.507 --> 45:43.497
Well, then, you're not a loser.
We're gonna have fun tomorrow, right?

45:43.607 --> 45:47.167
Yeah.

45:47.277 --> 45:49.977
We can tell 'em all to go to hell.

45:50.087 --> 45:52.746
Good night, sweetie.
I love you.

46:14.606 --> 46:17.266
What are you doing?

46:17.376 --> 46:19.606
I'm gonna fix this.

46:22.085 --> 46:23.985
Richard-

46:25.355 --> 46:27.255
I'm gonna fix this.

46:56.184 --> 46:58.874
Here we go.
Here we go.

47:23.743 --> 47:25.643
Hi.

48:41.661 --> 48:43.721
Hi. Stan Grossman, please.

48:48.600 --> 48:51.800
Stan, it's Richard.
I don't know where the fuck you are.

48:51.900 --> 48:54.060
I'm at the hotel.
Call me.

49:13.720 --> 49:16.089
But it's funny.

49:18.129 --> 49:20.619
<i>So I said, "You want me to teach you
about life experiences?</i>

49:20.729 --> 49:23.819
You can write a book
about my experiences. "

49:23.929 --> 49:26.699
So he says to me-

49:28.639 --> 49:30.539
Hello, Stan.

49:30.639 --> 49:32.769
You're the one
that said it would sell!

49:32.879 --> 49:34.779
That's what I thought at the time.

49:34.879 --> 49:38.139
But it's a great program.
You said so yourself. I don't understand.

49:38.249 --> 49:42.209
It's not the program, Richard.
It's you. Okay?

49:42.319 --> 49:47.218
No one's heard of you.
Nobody cares.

49:53.758 --> 49:56.158
What's the next step?

49:56.268 --> 49:59.288
There is none.
We had our shot.

49:59.398 --> 50:02.098
It didn't fly.
We move on.

50:02.208 --> 50:05.278
- You-You mean give up?
- Richard.

50:05.388 --> 50:09.648
Hey, wh-Whoa, hey! One setback here,
and you're ready to just quit?

50:09.758 --> 50:12.877
Richard, listen.
I pushed this thing hard, okay?

50:12.987 --> 50:16.787
I rammed it down their fucking throats,
and no one bought it!

50:16.897 --> 50:21.697
It's time to move on.
You're not gonna win this one.

50:23.937 --> 50:26.237
Okay. Okay.
You know what?

50:26.337 --> 50:29.597
Good. I'm glad.
You know why?

50:29.707 --> 50:32.137
Because this is what
the nine steps are all about.

50:32.247 --> 50:34.177
- Right here, Stan. Right here!
- Richard.

50:34.277 --> 50:35.677
<i>- Richard, please.
- You blew it!</i>

50:35.777 --> 50:38.217
You blew it.
You're out.

50:47.286 --> 50:50.846
<i>Mom? Dad?</i>

50:54.796 --> 50:58.026
What is it, hon?

50:58.136 --> 51:00.366
Grandpa won't wake up.

51:15.855 --> 51:17.755
Want to take an eye test?

51:19.085 --> 51:21.385
Uncle Frank?
An eye test?

51:23.925 --> 51:26.085
Olive, come here.
Put those away.

51:26.195 --> 51:29.185
We're gonna have a family meeting.
Dwayne, family meeting.

51:33.505 --> 51:35.625
First of all...

51:35.735 --> 51:39.834
the doctors are doing everything they can
to help Grandpa right now.

51:39.944 --> 51:44.004
He's had a long, eventful life...

51:44.114 --> 51:47.244
and I know he loves
both of you very much.

51:47.344 --> 51:52.014
<i>But if God wants to take him,
we have to be ready to accept that, okay?</i>

51:53.884 --> 51:58.224
<i>Whatever happens,
we're a family.</i>

51:59.994 --> 52:02.794
And what's important
is that we love each other.

52:02.894 --> 52:06.624
I love you guys so, so much.

52:26.283 --> 52:29.453
Look at this.
This is a 15-pound turkey.

52:29.553 --> 52:32.543
It does it in three hours' time.

52:35.493 --> 52:37.822
Are you the family of Edwin Hoover?

52:37.932 --> 52:39.842
Yes.

52:41.612 --> 52:46.072
I'm sorry.
We did everything we could.

52:46.182 --> 52:49.082
He was, uh-

52:49.182 --> 52:51.712
Well, it was too much.

52:51.822 --> 52:55.082
He probably just fell asleep
and never woke up.

52:57.162 --> 53:00.922
I'll have someone come talk to you
about handling the remains.

53:05.371 --> 53:07.271
Thank you.

53:16.311 --> 53:18.971
Linda!

53:23.981 --> 53:26.281
Mom?

53:26.391 --> 53:28.291
Is Grandpa dead?

53:28.391 --> 53:31.651
Yeah, honey.
He passed away.

53:38.830 --> 53:41.670
<i>That's what this
machine does. Chicken, fish or beef.</i>

53:41.770 --> 53:44.640
<i>So you always look forward
to eating the food.</i>

53:44.740 --> 53:48.230
<i>And that, I believe-</i>

53:48.340 --> 53:50.970
<i>Put it in the machine.
Center it. Turn it around.</i>

53:51.080 --> 53:55.170
Hi. I'm your
bereavement liaison, Linda.

53:58.920 --> 54:02.409
- My consolations for your loss.
- Thank you.

54:02.519 --> 54:05.859
Okay, these are the forms
you need to fill out.

54:05.959 --> 54:08.549
A death certificate.

54:08.659 --> 54:11.759
A report of death.
An M.E. Pink slip.

54:11.869 --> 54:14.829
Please try and be
as detailed as possible.

54:14.929 --> 54:17.029
Um, this is a brochure...

54:17.139 --> 54:20.109
for a grief recovery support
group that meets on Tuesdays.

54:20.209 --> 54:23.229
And, if you like, at this time,
I can refer you to a funeral home...

54:23.339 --> 54:25.279
so you can begin making
your own arrangements.

54:25.379 --> 54:29.339
Actually, prearrangements
have already been made in Albuquerque.

54:31.348 --> 54:34.318
- Albuquerque?
- We're actually on our way to California right now.

54:34.418 --> 54:39.258
If the body is crossing state lines,
you're gonna need a burial transit permit.

54:39.358 --> 54:42.518
Okay, but we're trying
to get to Redondo Beach by 3:00.

54:42.628 --> 54:46.688
3:00 today? Hmm.
Ain't gonna happen.

54:48.938 --> 54:50.988
Okay, um, can I just-

54:51.098 --> 54:54.668
I know that this is, uh-
this might be a little unusual...

54:54.768 --> 54:57.268
but if maybe we could just go.

54:57.378 --> 55:00.777
And then we'll come back, and we'll
take care of all the paperwork and-

55:00.877 --> 55:02.807
No. You can't just abandon the body.

55:02.917 --> 55:06.647
<i>No, no, no. Nobody's gonna abandon
the body. We're gonna go and-</i>

55:06.747 --> 55:09.047
Otherwise, the hospital
becomes responsible.

55:09.157 --> 55:11.487
<i>Sir, there are ways
we have of doing things.</i>

55:11.587 --> 55:13.487
We're gonna go and come back.

55:13.587 --> 55:17.397
You are not the only one that's
had somebody die here today, okay?

55:22.107 --> 55:26.507
Is there any way we might
be able to view the remains?

55:31.646 --> 55:35.386
We haven't had a chance
to move him downstairs...

55:35.486 --> 55:39.716
so someone may come in in a few minutes
to take him to the basement.

55:39.826 --> 55:42.726
Just tell them who you are,
and they will wait.

55:42.826 --> 55:44.766
- Thank you.
- Okay?

55:44.866 --> 55:48.766
And when you're done with the paperwork,
I'll be at the nurses' station.

55:48.866 --> 55:51.306
- Great. Thank you, Linda.
- Thank you.

56:28.704 --> 56:32.764
Goddamn it, Dad.
Goddamn it!

56:34.814 --> 56:36.714
Stupid.

56:46.154 --> 56:49.144
We'll go to Little Miss Sunshine
next year, okay, honey?

56:49.264 --> 56:51.164
<i>Next year.</i>

56:59.503 --> 57:04.333
No. No.
We've come 700 miles.

57:04.443 --> 57:07.843
I will be damned if I'm not
making that contest, Sheryl.

57:07.943 --> 57:10.503
Well, Richard,
we can't leave him here.

57:13.583 --> 57:16.073
We're not gonna leave him.

57:17.553 --> 57:20.923
- Richard, what are you doing?
- Fuck.

57:26.632 --> 57:28.922
- Dwayne, go around outside.
- Richard, what are you thinking?

57:29.032 --> 57:31.902
<i>- We're gonna take him with us.
- No, no. That is not happening.</i>

57:32.002 --> 57:34.062
He's better off with us
that these people.

57:34.172 --> 57:36.532
<i>I want you to go around outside
and underneath this window.</i>

57:36.642 --> 57:38.542
<i>Dwayne, don't you dare move.</i>

57:38.642 --> 57:41.802
Honey, you stay here.
We'll take Olive. Frank can drive.

57:41.912 --> 57:46.472
No, Sheryl, we'll be there in two hours.
I'll call a funeral home once we get there.

57:46.582 --> 57:48.812
If there's one thing
my father would have wanted...

57:48.922 --> 57:51.792
<i>it's to see Olive perform
in the Little Miss Sunshine Pageant.</i>

57:51.892 --> 57:55.761
<i>Now, I believe we'd be doing
a grave disservice to his memory...</i>

57:55.871 --> 57:57.831
if we were to just give up now.

57:57.931 --> 58:01.301
All right? There's two kinds
of people in this world.

58:01.401 --> 58:04.811
<i>There's winners and there's losers. Okay?
You know what the difference is?</i>

58:04.911 --> 58:06.901
Winners don't give up.

58:07.011 --> 58:10.641
So what are we here?
Are we winners, or are we losers?

58:10.751 --> 58:12.911
<i>Huh?</i>

58:13.021 --> 58:15.851
Okay, okay, okay.
Let's do it.

58:15.951 --> 58:18.851
You guys go. Olive,
you watch the curtain.

58:23.890 --> 58:28.190
I don't know. I have no reason
to assume it's gonna be otherwise.

58:28.300 --> 58:30.320
Watch. Get the back.
Get the back.

58:30.430 --> 58:33.530
Shh. Go, go, go.

58:33.640 --> 58:36.330
<i>Yeah, 1:00.</i>

58:38.670 --> 58:40.640
Now?

58:40.740 --> 58:43.800
- He's very heavy. Be gentle.
- Mm-hmm.

58:43.910 --> 58:46.210
<i>Now!</i>

58:46.320 --> 58:48.720
<i>One, two-</i>

58:48.820 --> 58:51.119
Okay, three.
Wait, wait, wait!

58:51.219 --> 58:53.749
<i>Not yet. Not yet.</i>

58:53.859 --> 58:57.879
- Okay, go. Go, go, go.
- Shh, shh, shh. Okay.

58:57.989 --> 59:00.189
<i>Richard, I can't do it!</i>

59:00.299 --> 59:02.229
- I got him. I got him.
- Come on.

59:02.329 --> 59:04.559
Come on!
Hurry up!

59:08.909 --> 59:11.929
Okay, he's slipping.
Okay.

59:12.039 --> 59:15.569
Hold on.

59:15.679 --> 59:18.169
I got it. I got it.
I got it. I got it.

59:21.348 --> 59:23.408
Be careful.

59:26.758 --> 59:30.318
- Be cool. Be cool.
- Hurry up.

59:31.758 --> 59:33.658
Keep watch, Olive.

59:34.898 --> 59:37.588
Watch the curb.
Watch the curb.

59:43.968 --> 59:46.028
Watch his head!
Watch it!

59:46.138 --> 59:48.297
<i>Keys.</i>

59:51.807 --> 59:54.717
<i>Swing him around this way.</i>

59:54.817 --> 59:57.117
<i>- Olive, get in.
- Here we go.</i>

59:57.217 --> 59:59.147
Okay, let's go.

01:00:02.757 --> 01:00:05.417
Sheryl. Let's go, Frank.

01:00:05.527 --> 01:00:09.117
Did I mention that I am the preeminent
Proust scholar in the U. S?

01:00:09.227 --> 01:00:13.127
Here we go! Here we go!

01:00:13.237 --> 01:00:15.637
Are you okay?

01:00:23.406 --> 01:00:25.876
- Dad?
- Yeah, honey?

01:00:29.526 --> 01:00:31.756
What's gonna happen to Grandpa?

01:00:53.545 --> 01:00:55.875
Uncle Frank?

01:00:55.985 --> 01:00:57.955
Yeah?

01:00:59.625 --> 01:01:01.745
Do you think there's a heaven?

01:01:03.995 --> 01:01:08.755
That's hard to say, Olive.
L- I don't think anyone knows for sure.

01:01:08.865 --> 01:01:12.425
<i>I know, but what do you think?</i>

01:01:13.565 --> 01:01:16.294
Um, well-

01:01:16.404 --> 01:01:18.374
I think there is one.

01:01:20.104 --> 01:01:23.044
- You think I'll get in?
- Yes.

01:01:23.144 --> 01:01:25.234
- Promise?
- Yes.

01:01:38.624 --> 01:01:41.614
Whoa! Hey! Son of a bitch!

01:01:41.724 --> 01:01:44.563
- What happened?
- He- He cut me off.

01:01:48.663 --> 01:01:50.963
<i>- It's stuck.
- Okay, just leave it.</i>

01:01:51.073 --> 01:01:53.473
It's stuck or something.

01:01:53.573 --> 01:01:56.973
- Maybe-Try pulling it from under here.
- No, no. Just leave it.

01:01:58.413 --> 01:02:01.473
<i>- Fix it when we get there.
- Okay, fine.</i>

01:02:01.583 --> 01:02:04.383
Shit!

01:02:07.583 --> 01:02:10.383
Oh, Jesus! God!

01:02:10.493 --> 01:02:13.422
<i>I'm being pulled over.
Here we go.</i>

01:02:14.862 --> 01:02:19.062
Okay. Everybody just
pretend to be normal, okay?

01:02:19.162 --> 01:02:22.032
<i>Like-Like everything's normal here.</i>

01:02:34.882 --> 01:02:37.352
How you folks doin'?

01:02:37.452 --> 01:02:41.251
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, we're fine.
Just-

01:02:41.351 --> 01:02:44.381
- Little trouble with the horn?
- Sorry. What?

01:02:44.491 --> 01:02:46.961
- Havin' a little trouble with your horn?
- Yeah.

01:02:48.291 --> 01:02:51.621
Little trouble. Sorry.
Uh, sorry.

01:02:51.731 --> 01:02:54.751
Could you step outside
the vehicle?

01:03:03.921 --> 01:03:06.111
- Step this way, please.
- No, no.

01:03:06.221 --> 01:03:08.811
- What?
- Don't-

01:03:08.921 --> 01:03:11.120
"Don't" what?

01:03:13.830 --> 01:03:16.590
- Do you have something in your trunk, sir?
- It's nothing. L-

01:03:16.700 --> 01:03:20.720
- Don't- Don't open it. - You've just given
me probable cause to search your trunk.

01:03:20.830 --> 01:03:23.930
- Just- I- I just-
- Put your hands on the vehicle now! Now!

01:03:24.770 --> 01:03:27.030
- Don't move.
- Okay.

01:03:30.340 --> 01:03:33.900
- It's not illegal!
- Sir, I would advise you to keep your mouth shut!

01:03:35.880 --> 01:03:38.749
Oh, my God.
What is he doing?

01:03:44.459 --> 01:03:47.289
<i>- It's not illegal.
- Goddamn.</i>

01:03:53.599 --> 01:03:55.729
Sir, could you come back here?

01:04:04.639 --> 01:04:07.478
I love this stuff. I love it.

01:04:07.578 --> 01:04:09.608
God bless ya.
God bless ya.

01:04:09.718 --> 01:04:12.078
Don't worry.
I'm not gonna bust ya.

01:04:12.178 --> 01:04:14.648
Oh, thank you.

01:04:14.748 --> 01:04:17.378
How you doin'?

01:04:19.988 --> 01:04:22.928
- Cute- Cute family. That's nice.
- Thank you.

01:04:23.028 --> 01:04:26.228
- This on the side. A little of
this, a little of that. - It's-

01:04:26.328 --> 01:04:28.558
- Oh, man.
- Sweet- Sweetness.

01:04:28.668 --> 01:04:30.828
That is sweet. Yeah.

01:04:30.938 --> 01:04:34.338
- Dirty.
- And this one is one of my favorites.

01:04:34.438 --> 01:04:36.567
Ahh, good, yeah.

01:04:38.137 --> 01:04:40.607
<i>That's a little different choice.</i>

01:04:42.917 --> 01:04:45.407
No?

01:04:47.387 --> 01:04:49.677
- Gonna leave that with ya.
- All right.

01:04:49.787 --> 01:04:52.547
- You have a good day there.
- Yeah.

01:05:03.967 --> 01:05:06.436
What happened?

01:05:06.536 --> 01:05:10.026
<i>I'll tell you when I regain consciousness.</i>

01:05:12.336 --> 01:05:15.776
Frank, Dwayne, get out and push.

01:05:33.196 --> 01:05:36.425
Okay, there it is- Redondo Beach, 46.

01:05:36.535 --> 01:05:38.875
It's 2:15.
Might be a few minutes late.

01:05:38.975 --> 01:05:43.605
<i>They said 3:00 sharp. They were very explicit.
We can't cross these people. Trust me.</i>

01:05:43.715 --> 01:05:46.775
- Mom, Dwayne has 20/20 vision.
- I bet he does.

01:05:46.885 --> 01:05:50.255
- Okay, now I'm gonna check
to see if you're color blind.

01:05:50.355 --> 01:05:52.485
<i>Asshole!</i>

01:05:52.595 --> 01:05:56.545
What's the letter in the circle?

01:05:59.225 --> 01:06:01.725
<i>No, no, no.
Inside the circle.</i>

01:06:01.835 --> 01:06:04.094
<i>Right there. See?</i>

01:06:04.204 --> 01:06:07.964
It's an "A." Can't you see it?
Right there.

01:06:10.874 --> 01:06:13.174
It's bright green.

01:06:15.774 --> 01:06:17.674
Oh, man.

01:06:26.324 --> 01:06:29.524
Dwayne, I think you
might be color blind.

01:06:39.833 --> 01:06:42.433
You can't fly jets
if you're color blind.

01:06:55.613 --> 01:06:58.953
We've got a little bit of-
Okay, got an emergency back here.

01:06:59.053 --> 01:07:01.522
- I think we need to pull over.
- What is it?

01:07:01.622 --> 01:07:04.282
<i>- What's the emergency?
- Pull over.</i>

01:07:04.392 --> 01:07:07.222
<i>It's all right, man. Dwayne, Dwayne!
It's all right. Hold on.</i>

01:07:07.332 --> 01:07:09.792
- Just pull over the car!
- Okay! All right!

01:07:09.902 --> 01:07:13.332
- Could you get him to pull over, please?
- Richard, pull over!

01:07:13.432 --> 01:07:16.132
- Richard, pull over the car!
- It's all right. We're pulling over.

01:07:16.242 --> 01:07:18.332
- I'm pulling over. Stop it.
- It's all right.

01:07:18.442 --> 01:07:22.462
- Dwayne! No, no. Dwayne. Sit down.
- God, this better be good.

01:07:22.572 --> 01:07:25.242
<i>- Pull over.
- I'm pulling over. All right.</i>

01:07:25.342 --> 01:07:28.782
- Stop the car. It's gonna be okay, Dwayne.
- All right. Don't open the door.

01:07:28.881 --> 01:07:30.851
Dwayne? Oh, God!

01:07:34.921 --> 01:07:36.891
Fuck!

01:07:41.561 --> 01:07:44.961
- What happened?
- He's color blind. He can't fly.

01:07:45.061 --> 01:07:47.461
Oh, Jesus. Oh, no.

01:07:52.541 --> 01:07:54.671
Uh, just-
just give him a second.

01:08:17.770 --> 01:08:19.740
Dwayne?

01:08:22.580 --> 01:08:24.740
Dwayne, honey, I'm sorry.

01:08:31.448 --> 01:08:35.179
- Dwayne, come on. We have to go.
- I'm not going.

01:08:37.929 --> 01:08:40.618
- Dwayne-
- I said I'm not.

01:08:40.729 --> 01:08:44.999
Okay? I don't care.
I'm not getting on that bus again.

01:08:45.099 --> 01:08:47.299
Dwayne, for better or worse,
we're your family.

01:08:47.399 --> 01:08:51.198
<i>No, you're not my family!
Okay? I don't wanna be your family!</i>

01:08:51.309 --> 01:08:55.497
I hate you fucking people!
I hate you!

01:08:55.608 --> 01:08:58.978
Divorce, bankrupt, suicide!

01:08:59.078 --> 01:09:02.518
<i>You fucking losers!
You're losers!</i>

01:09:05.488 --> 01:09:08.548
No. Please
just leave me here, Mom.

01:09:08.658 --> 01:09:11.587
Okay?
Please, please, please.

01:09:14.358 --> 01:09:16.328
Please just leave me here.

01:09:27.537 --> 01:09:29.506
Shit.

01:09:32.407 --> 01:09:34.537
I don't know what to do.

01:09:34.647 --> 01:09:37.546
<i>Well, it's gettin'late.</i>

01:09:37.647 --> 01:09:40.587
Maybe- Can somebody
stay here with him?

01:09:40.687 --> 01:09:43.846
- I'll stay.
- Oh, that is not happening.

01:09:46.727 --> 01:09:48.857
All right. Well...

01:09:48.957 --> 01:09:50.926
uh...

01:09:51.966 --> 01:09:54.086
I'm just worried about the time.

01:09:57.036 --> 01:09:59.666
Olive, you, uh-

01:09:59.776 --> 01:10:01.896
you wanna try talking to him?

01:10:02.006 --> 01:10:05.276
Richard, no! There is nothing to say.
We just have to wait.

01:10:05.376 --> 01:10:07.846
Honey-

01:10:57.004 --> 01:10:58.974
Okay.

01:11:00.804 --> 01:11:02.774
Let's go.

01:11:33.673 --> 01:11:36.733
I apologize for the things I said.

01:11:36.843 --> 01:11:41.283
I was upset.
I didn't really mean them.

01:11:43.683 --> 01:11:46.673
It's okay. Come on.
Let's go.

01:11:51.192 --> 01:11:53.092
2:55.

01:11:53.192 --> 01:11:55.682
All right. Everybody,
look for the exit, okay?

01:11:59.362 --> 01:12:01.992
Okay, here! Here's the turnoff.
Turn in here.

01:12:02.102 --> 01:12:04.532
Does anybody see
the Redondo Suites?

01:12:04.632 --> 01:12:07.972
<i>- There's the hotel!
- There it is! There it is, Olive.</i>

01:12:08.072 --> 01:12:11.842
<i>We're gonna make it.
We're gonna make it. All right.</i>

01:12:11.942 --> 01:12:15.672
How- How the hell
do you get over there?

01:12:15.782 --> 01:12:18.641
<i>- Sheryl?
- No, no, no, no!</i>

01:12:18.751 --> 01:12:22.771
<i>- You're passing it!
- Turn around, turn around.</i>

01:12:22.881 --> 01:12:25.481
- You drove past it!
- You've gotta turn around!

01:12:25.591 --> 01:12:27.781
- It's back there!
- I can't turn around.

01:12:27.891 --> 01:12:30.651
- Anybody see a way back? It's a one-way street!
- Oh!

01:12:30.761 --> 01:12:34.821
Rich! You've got parking lots on the right!

01:12:34.931 --> 01:12:37.991
<i>- Here, here!
- Put your seat belt on, baby!</i>

01:12:38.101 --> 01:12:40.731
- What are you doing?
- I can't slow down! I can't!

01:12:40.841 --> 01:12:43.671
- What time is it, Frank?
- Oh, 2:59.

01:12:43.771 --> 01:12:46.940
- Dad!
- Straight shot from here. We're gonna make it.

01:12:47.040 --> 01:12:49.510
- Oh, it's a dead end!
- I'm not goin' back!

01:12:49.610 --> 01:12:52.310
- You have to go back!
- That is a one-way road!

01:12:52.410 --> 01:12:55.380
That'll take us all the way
back to the freeway!

01:12:55.480 --> 01:12:59.220
- You're the one who told me
to go left back there!

01:12:59.320 --> 01:13:01.810
I'm not turnin' back.

01:13:01.920 --> 01:13:03.910
<i>- Richard!
- It's right there.</i>

01:13:06.290 --> 01:13:09.320
What-What are you doing?
You can't do this!

01:13:09.430 --> 01:13:12.600
- God, Richard!
- Okay, here's the hotel.

01:13:12.700 --> 01:13:14.360
<i>Okay, stop!</i>

01:13:14.470 --> 01:13:16.529
<i>- Where's the entrance?
- Right here!</i>

01:13:16.639 --> 01:13:18.569
You passed it!
You're passing it!

01:13:18.669 --> 01:13:20.639
Hold on!

01:13:22.309 --> 01:13:24.439
Here we go. One more time.
Little bump.

01:13:31.099 --> 01:13:33.189
Mom!

01:14:12.767 --> 01:14:15.567
Hello?
Hi. We'd like to register.

01:14:15.667 --> 01:14:19.367
- Sorry, we're closed.
- Uh, no. We have the entrant right here.

01:14:19.477 --> 01:14:22.937
- We just wanna check in.
- Registration ended at 3:00.

01:14:23.047 --> 01:14:25.917
- It's 3:00 now.
- No.

01:14:26.017 --> 01:14:30.177
Come on. Have a heart. We're four minutes late.
We just drove all the way from Albuquerque.

01:14:30.287 --> 01:14:32.757
- Then you should've been here by 3:00.
- Wait, wait.

01:14:32.857 --> 01:14:35.547
There must be some way
we can work this out. Please.

01:14:35.657 --> 01:14:38.817
<i>Everybody else was here before 3:00.
I'd be giving unfair advantage.</i>

01:14:38.927 --> 01:14:41.986
No, we're not looking for an advantage.
We just want her to compete.

01:14:42.096 --> 01:14:44.586
Don't yell at me, sir.
I didn't make you late.

01:14:44.696 --> 01:14:47.966
We've settled on the schedule for the show.
We've turned off the computers.

01:14:48.066 --> 01:14:51.266
- Our lineup is final. I have a hair check to do.
- Okay-

01:14:51.376 --> 01:14:54.566
I'm sorry that you're late,
but I can't help you.

01:14:55.806 --> 01:14:57.936
Please.

01:14:59.646 --> 01:15:03.046
You don't know
what we've been through.

01:15:06.116 --> 01:15:10.525
<i>Um, Miss Jenkins?
L- I can put 'em in the system.</i>

01:15:10.625 --> 01:15:14.955
<i>- Oh, Kirby, you don't have to.
- No, it's okay. Takes five minutes.</i>

01:15:15.065 --> 01:15:18.515
Well, it's your time.
Excuse me.

01:15:18.635 --> 01:15:20.995
<i>Thank you, Kirby.
Thank you very much.</i>

01:15:21.105 --> 01:15:23.195
<i>Really, you don't know
what this means.</i>

01:15:23.305 --> 01:15:25.295
Please, it's only five minutes.

01:15:25.405 --> 01:15:28.395
I am not working for these people
next year. These people are crazy.

01:15:30.175 --> 01:15:32.305
<i>Okay, so, what's your name?</i>

01:15:32.415 --> 01:15:34.845
<i>- Olive.
- That's a nice name.</i>

01:15:34.945 --> 01:15:38.345
<i>- Mom, Mom! Look!
- What's her last name?</i>

01:15:38.455 --> 01:15:41.144
- It's Miss California. It's really her!
- You want to go say hi?

01:15:41.254 --> 01:15:43.224
<i>Albuquerque-</i>

01:15:45.624 --> 01:15:48.284
<i>- Thank you.
- Bonnie, come here.</i>

01:15:48.394 --> 01:15:51.594
- Hi! What's your name?
- Olive.

01:15:51.694 --> 01:15:55.154
- What's your talent, Olive?
- I like dancing.

01:15:55.264 --> 01:15:57.864
Dancing was too hard for me.
I'm a singer.

01:15:57.974 --> 01:16:00.164
You must be a good dancer.

01:16:00.274 --> 01:16:02.304
I am. I'm really good.

01:16:02.414 --> 01:16:04.584
<i>I bet you are.</i>

01:16:04.684 --> 01:16:07.553
Well, thanks for stopping by,
Olive. Best of luck.

01:16:09.623 --> 01:16:12.723
Hmm. Miss California?

01:16:12.823 --> 01:16:16.233
- Do you eat ice cream?
- I love ice cream.

01:16:16.333 --> 01:16:19.633
My favorite flavor is
Chocolate Cherry Garcia...

01:16:19.733 --> 01:16:23.763
<i>although, technically,
I think that's a frozen yogurt.</i>

01:16:23.873 --> 01:16:27.363
- Okay?
- Okay. Thanks. Bye.

01:16:27.473 --> 01:16:29.943
Bye.

01:16:30.043 --> 01:16:33.573
- Mom, she eats ice cream.
- I heard.

01:16:35.053 --> 01:16:38.782
Your packet has tickets in it,
and there's your badge number.

01:16:38.882 --> 01:16:40.852
- Okay.
- Is there anything else?

01:16:40.952 --> 01:16:43.582
Uh, yeah. Is there a funeral home
around here?

01:16:58.502 --> 01:17:01.172
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:17:03.072 --> 01:17:05.571
<i>Okay, Olive,
let's get your swimsuit on.</i>

01:17:05.681 --> 01:17:07.801
You wanna go change
behind the curtain?

01:17:07.911 --> 01:17:11.251
<i>This is the last touch-up, everybody.
Final touch-ups. Last touch-up.</i>

01:17:42.880 --> 01:17:46.280
<i>- Okay! Wait!
- I won't wait for you!</i>

01:17:47.320 --> 01:17:49.290
Let's get outta here.

01:17:53.730 --> 01:17:56.390
Hey! Hey, Olive Hoover.

01:17:56.490 --> 01:17:59.190
- Mm-hmm?
- Hey, I need your music.

01:17:59.300 --> 01:18:01.860
- Oh, music, right.
- Yeah.

01:18:04.899 --> 01:18:06.869
Where is it? All right.

01:18:09.309 --> 01:18:11.279
Here you go.

01:18:11.379 --> 01:18:14.779
- This? Did you choose this?
- No, my grandpa did.

01:18:14.879 --> 01:18:16.849
- Your grandpa?
- Mm-hmm.

01:18:16.949 --> 01:18:18.919
- Which track?
- Twelve.

01:18:19.019 --> 01:18:23.819
We were drivin' five, six hours.
Thought he was napping.

01:18:23.919 --> 01:18:26.479
By the time we figured it out, it's-

01:18:27.589 --> 01:18:29.619
- You know.
- Too late.

01:18:31.329 --> 01:18:33.888
So where's the body?

01:18:33.998 --> 01:18:35.968
Um-

01:18:51.158 --> 01:18:53.128
Personal effects.

01:18:53.228 --> 01:18:55.198
- Thank you.
- You take care.

01:18:56.828 --> 01:18:58.858
You too.

01:19:20.617 --> 01:19:22.517
<i>I'm ready.</i>

01:19:22.557 --> 01:19:23.847
<i>I'm ready.</i>

01:19:27.697 --> 01:19:31.026
- She was scared, but she did very well.
- Was she?

01:19:35.096 --> 01:19:39.556
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to the 24th annual...</i>

01:19:39.666 --> 01:19:43.106

01:19:43.206 --> 01:19:46.536
<i>Yes!</i>

01:19:46.646 --> 01:19:51.016
Now, please, put your hands together once
again and help me welcome to the stage...

our 12 beautiful contestants!

01:20:14.475 --> 01:20:15.765
Wow.

01:21:16.043 --> 01:21:20.773
<i>Oh, let's have a big round of applause
for our lovely contestants!</i>

01:21:22.283 --> 01:21:25.682
<i>At the end of the evening,
one of these girls...</i>

01:21:25.782 --> 01:21:29.222
will be crowned
Little Miss Sunshine!

01:21:37.862 --> 01:21:40.592
<i>Olive, honey,
are you okay in there?</i>

01:21:40.702 --> 01:21:42.662
<i>Yeah, I'm fine.</i>

01:21:45.302 --> 01:21:47.202
Hey.

01:21:48.502 --> 01:21:50.402
What?

01:21:50.512 --> 01:21:53.571
<i>You got a kid in the show?</i>

01:21:53.681 --> 01:21:55.641
Your first time?

01:21:55.741 --> 01:21:57.711
Yeah, yeah.

01:22:46.190 --> 01:22:48.920
<i>America!</i>

01:22:49.030 --> 01:22:51.119
<i>It's so beautiful!</i>

01:22:54.099 --> 01:22:58.099
<i>Sometimes I just wish
I could go to sleep till I was 18...</i>

01:22:58.209 --> 01:23:03.339
and skip all this crap- high school
and everything-just skip it.

01:23:05.749 --> 01:23:08.219
You know Marcel Proust?

01:23:08.319 --> 01:23:10.839
- He's the guy you teach.
- Yeah.

01:23:10.949 --> 01:23:14.319
French writer.
Total loser.

01:23:14.419 --> 01:23:16.479
Never had a real job.

01:23:16.589 --> 01:23:19.818
Unrequited love affairs. Gay.

01:23:19.928 --> 01:23:22.858
Spent 20 years writing a book
almost no one reads.

01:23:22.958 --> 01:23:25.258
But he's also probably
the greatest writer since Shakespeare.

01:23:25.368 --> 01:23:29.738
Anyway, he, uh-
he gets down to the end of his life...

01:23:29.838 --> 01:23:32.898
and he looks back and decides
that all those years he suffered-

01:23:33.008 --> 01:23:37.168
Those were the best years of his life,
'cause they made him who he was.

01:23:37.278 --> 01:23:41.178
All the years he was happy? You know,
total waste. Didn't learn a thing.

01:23:41.278 --> 01:23:45.478
So, if you sleep until you're 18...

01:23:45.588 --> 01:23:49.047
ah, think of the suffering
you're gonna miss.

01:23:49.167 --> 01:23:52.827
I mean, high school? High school-
Those are your prime suffering years.

01:23:52.937 --> 01:23:55.407
You don't get better suffering
than that.

01:23:59.377 --> 01:24:01.347
You know what?

01:24:03.147 --> 01:24:05.117
Fuck beauty contests.

01:24:06.417 --> 01:24:09.717
Life is one fucking
beauty contest after another.

01:24:09.817 --> 01:24:13.377
You know, school,
then college, then work?

01:24:13.487 --> 01:24:15.457
Fuck that.

01:24:15.557 --> 01:24:17.686
And fuck the Air Force Academy.

01:24:17.796 --> 01:24:21.926
If I wanna fly,
I'll find a way to fly.

01:24:22.026 --> 01:24:24.966
You do what you love,
and fuck the rest.

01:24:30.906 --> 01:24:33.206
I'm glad you're talkin' again, Dwayne.

01:24:35.446 --> 01:24:38.306
You're not nearly as stupid as you look.

01:24:45.656 --> 01:24:47.615
Wanna go back?

01:24:47.725 --> 01:24:50.125
Not really.

01:24:51.525 --> 01:24:54.355
Yeah, we should go back.

01:24:56.865 --> 01:25:00.265
<i>And now, the moment
we've all been waiting for-</i>

01:25:00.365 --> 01:25:02.765
the talent competition.

01:25:13.845 --> 01:25:15.784
Miss Carly Nugent.

01:25:44.943 --> 01:25:47.373
Yee-haw!

01:25:47.483 --> 01:25:50.043
<i>Yodel-lay-he-hoo, that was great!</i>

01:26:07.663 --> 01:26:09.693
<i>Wow-ow-ow-ow!</i>

01:26:09.803 --> 01:26:12.273
<i>Funky-licious!</i>

01:26:33.902 --> 01:26:36.032
<i>I'm goin' backstage.</i>

01:26:36.132 --> 01:26:38.102
Yeah, right. See ya.

01:26:41.342 --> 01:26:44.571
Oh, look at you.
Is that your costume?

01:26:44.681 --> 01:26:46.641
Mm-hmm.

01:26:47.681 --> 01:26:49.671
Okay, here.

01:26:52.221 --> 01:26:55.951
- Hey, what's goin' on?
- Oh, I just- I came to wish Olive good luck.

01:26:56.051 --> 01:26:58.421
- How you doin', honey?
- Good.

01:26:58.521 --> 01:27:00.461
- Nervous.
- Yeah. You're gonna do great.

01:27:00.561 --> 01:27:03.251
I just know it.

01:27:03.361 --> 01:27:06.191
- Can I talk to you for a second?
- Yeah.

01:27:06.301 --> 01:27:08.771
What's up?

01:27:10.800 --> 01:27:12.930
I don't want her to go on.

01:27:15.870 --> 01:27:18.810
- Are you authorized to be backstage?
- No. Hey.

01:27:18.910 --> 01:27:21.380
<i>- Where are the dressing rooms?
- Are you allowed to be here?</i>

01:27:21.480 --> 01:27:23.450
Just tell me where
the dressing rooms are.

01:27:23.550 --> 01:27:27.710
<i>Listen, we're not in Albuquerque anymore.</i>

01:27:27.820 --> 01:27:30.150
- Hey, how are you feeling?
- Better. Where's Olive?

01:27:30.250 --> 01:27:32.720
- There. What's up?
- Mom, I don't want Olive doing this.

01:27:32.820 --> 01:27:35.160
Oh, my God!

01:27:35.260 --> 01:27:37.780
- Look around. This place is fucked!
- He's right!

01:27:37.900 --> 01:27:40.589
Look, I don't want these
people judging Olive. Fuck them!

01:27:40.699 --> 01:27:44.229
- Listen, it is too late.
- No, it's not too late. You're the mom...

01:27:44.339 --> 01:27:46.999
and you're supposed to protect her.

01:27:47.099 --> 01:27:52.169
Everyone is gonna laugh at her, Mom.
Please don't let her do this.

01:27:52.279 --> 01:27:55.109
<i>Olive Hoover, two minutes.</i>

01:27:55.209 --> 01:27:58.079
<i>Look, she's not a beauty queen.</i>

01:27:58.179 --> 01:28:00.309
<i>She's just not.</i>

01:28:00.419 --> 01:28:04.319
- I'm gonna tell her.
- No, Dwayne. You listen to me. Olive is who she is.

01:28:04.419 --> 01:28:06.949
<i>She has worked so hard.
She's poured everything into this.</i>

01:28:07.059 --> 01:28:11.048
We can't just take it away
from her. We can't.

01:28:11.158 --> 01:28:16.158
I know you wanna protect her. I know, honey,
but... we gotta let Olive be Olive.

01:28:16.268 --> 01:28:19.598
<i>Olive Hoover. Are you the family?</i>

01:28:19.698 --> 01:28:21.728
Yeah. Okay?

01:28:23.438 --> 01:28:26.268
Olive, it's time. Okay?

01:28:26.378 --> 01:28:28.438
Yeah.

01:28:28.548 --> 01:28:31.208
- We gotta go now.
- Hang on.

01:28:31.318 --> 01:28:34.378
Olive, look at me.

01:28:34.488 --> 01:28:37.387
If you don't want to do this,
that's okay.

01:28:37.487 --> 01:28:42.047
If you want to sit this one out, it's totally
fine by us. We're proud of you anyway.

01:28:43.157 --> 01:28:45.127
<i>We gotta go.</i>

01:28:47.367 --> 01:28:49.327
<i>It's time.</i>

01:28:58.577 --> 01:29:00.547
Ready? Let's go.

01:29:12.466 --> 01:29:14.556
Good luck, honey.

01:29:14.666 --> 01:29:17.226
Copy that. Twenty-five
is performance ready...

01:29:17.336 --> 01:29:19.466
and we're walkin'...

01:29:19.566 --> 01:29:21.536
as fast as we can.

01:29:24.246 --> 01:29:26.206
- Is she going on?
- Yeah.

01:29:26.306 --> 01:29:28.276
She's going on.

01:29:31.316 --> 01:29:33.286
<i>Pure fairy-tale magic.</i>

01:29:33.386 --> 01:29:35.575
Miss Charisma Whiteman!

01:29:36.615 --> 01:29:38.785
Wasn't that a stardust fantasy?

01:29:38.955 --> 01:29:42.895
<i>Thank you for that.
You have been such a patient audience.</i>

01:29:42.995 --> 01:29:45.985
<i>We have one more contestant,
and then we'll be crowning our winner.</i>

01:29:46.095 --> 01:29:48.625
<i>Please give a warm welcome to...</i>

01:29:48.735 --> 01:29:52.425
<i>Miss... Olive Hoover!</i>

01:30:06.914 --> 01:30:08.884
You okay?

01:30:08.984 --> 01:30:13.254
Um, I'd like to dedicate this
to my grandpa...

01:30:13.354 --> 01:30:15.584
who showed me these moves.

01:30:15.694 --> 01:30:18.424
<i>Oh, that is so sweet!</i>

01:30:18.524 --> 01:30:21.394
<i>Is he here?
Where is your grandpa right now?</i>

01:30:21.494 --> 01:30:24.834
In the trunk of our car.

01:30:24.934 --> 01:30:26.904
Okay!

01:30:27.004 --> 01:30:29.474
<i>Well, take it away, Olive!</i>

01:30:45.053 --> 01:30:46.613
Huh!

01:31:21.992 --> 01:31:24.652
<i>You suck!</i>

01:31:24.762 --> 01:31:27.522
<i>Those little fuckers. I will kill them.</i>

01:31:27.632 --> 01:31:29.861
<i>You stink!</i>

01:31:37.851 --> 01:31:40.011
No, no, no, no, no.

01:32:10.810 --> 01:32:13.280
What is your daughter doing?

01:32:20.550 --> 01:32:23.520
She's kickin' ass.
That's what she's doin'.

01:32:38.239 --> 01:32:40.709
Get over here!
Get over here!

01:32:40.809 --> 01:32:44.739
<i>- I want that little ragamuffin off the stage this minute.
- All right.</i>

01:32:44.849 --> 01:32:47.309
- Get her. Right this minute!
- Don't touch- Don't touch her.

01:32:47.409 --> 01:32:50.979
- Your act's over, honey.
- Hey!

01:32:53.149 --> 01:32:56.118
- Hey! Hey, let go of my daughter!
- Oh!

01:32:56.218 --> 01:32:59.658
Holy sh-

01:32:59.758 --> 01:33:02.518
Let her finish!

01:33:04.398 --> 01:33:07.828
<i>Get off me!
Help! Get off me!</i>

01:33:07.938 --> 01:33:10.458
- Help me!
- Take charge! Just take charge!

01:33:10.568 --> 01:33:12.798
<i>Keep dancin', honey!
Daddy's okay.</i>

01:33:12.908 --> 01:33:18.108
Get your daughter
off this stage right now!

01:33:18.208 --> 01:33:20.178
Now!

01:33:25.287 --> 01:33:27.247
<i>Honey?</i>

01:33:44.407 --> 01:33:46.367
<i>- Like that?
- Oh!</i>

01:34:38.965 --> 01:34:40.935
- Ooh!
- Ah!

01:34:51.215 --> 01:34:54.904
Yeah! All right!

01:35:10.194 --> 01:35:12.924
Okay, you're out-

01:35:13.034 --> 01:35:16.224
on the condition that you never enter
your daughter in a beauty pageant...

01:35:16.334 --> 01:35:18.764
in the state of California ever again.

01:35:18.874 --> 01:35:20.833
Ever.

01:35:23.043 --> 01:35:25.333
I think we can live with that.

01:35:30.113 --> 01:35:33.273
All right.
We're back in business.

01:35:33.383 --> 01:35:36.043
Lock and load.

01:35:49.102 --> 01:35:52.432
Olive, your grandpa would've
been really proud of you.

01:35:52.532 --> 01:35:55.432
<i>- Yeah, you were great. Mm-wah!
- You were beyond great.</i>

01:35:55.542 --> 01:35:59.062
<i>- You were incredible.
- Thank you.</i>

01:36:02.642 --> 01:36:04.612
Let's get outta here.

01:36:28.901 --> 01:36:30.601
Whoo!

01:36:33.211 --> 01:36:35.141
It's in gear.

01:36:46.500 --> 01:36:48.970
What in the world?
