WEBVTT

01:20.760 --> 01:22.034
Don't get up.

01:22.120 --> 01:23.997
I'm all good, thanks.

01:24.080 --> 01:25.718
Lookâ€œ.

01:25.800 --> 01:27.120
All right, all right.

01:27.200 --> 01:29.476
<i>Arms and the Man
by Bernard Shaw.</i>

01:29.560 --> 01:31.153
You read that one before?

01:32.200 --> 01:35.875
After a horrifying sawing accident

01:35.960 --> 01:37.997
leaves him armless,

01:38.080 --> 01:42.074
the man sets out
on a journey of self-discovery,

01:42.160 --> 01:46.358
realizing that legs can do
everything that arms can!

01:46.440 --> 01:48.477
Is this what you do all day?

01:48.560 --> 01:51.439
Well, I mean, I got a nap
scheduled later, too.

01:51.520 --> 01:53.989
It probably means "arms"
as in "weapons."

01:54.120 --> 01:57.238
Oh.
Yo, it could be both. You know?

01:57.320 --> 01:59.357
Like... like,
dude ain't go no arms,

01:59.440 --> 02:01.829
he got to figure out how to hold
his weapon with his feet.

02:01.920 --> 02:04.150
Like, "Freeze, bitch!"

02:04.240 --> 02:06.550
Ain't you got anything better
to do with yourself?

02:08.120 --> 02:10.157
Did you not hear about
that nap situation?

02:10.240 --> 02:12.072
Man.

02:12.160 --> 02:16.757
You fucking lucky,
'cause maintenance sucks, yo.

02:16.840 --> 02:22.392
You should see what piles up
in the corners of the showers.

02:22.480 --> 02:26.269
Little pube-tropolis
of buildings and shit

02:26.360 --> 02:29.512
for spiders and... and bacteria
living their lives, growing...

02:29.600 --> 02:31.511
Well, see,
you went urban, right?

02:31.600 --> 02:34.035
I would have said
"A hairjungle," right?

02:34.160 --> 02:36.310
Spiders be jumping
from pube to pube.

02:36.400 --> 02:39.199
Bacteria's all like,
"Fuck! It rains a lot here!

02:39.280 --> 02:40.509
Get off me!"

02:40.600 --> 02:43.160
Did you hear about
the new job crew?

02:43.240 --> 02:45.356
Supposed to pay a buck an hour.

02:45.440 --> 02:47.033
A buck an hour?

02:47.160 --> 02:48.480
Shit, whatever that is,

02:48.560 --> 02:49.994
it's probably way worse
than pube town.

02:50.080 --> 02:51.798
Oh, it's a pube town now?

02:51.880 --> 02:53.837
Man, this place
ain't fool you enough

02:53.920 --> 02:55.354
with that...
that job-fair bullshit?

02:55.440 --> 02:57.477
Excuse me. Pause.

02:57.560 --> 03:00.871
I got two Cherry Pepsis
off of that mug,

03:00.960 --> 03:03.554
plus bragging rights.

03:03.640 --> 03:05.950
Yo... fuck that, man.

03:06.080 --> 03:09.232
My job is the shit. You know?

03:09.320 --> 03:12.278
I mean, worth way more
than buck an hour.

03:12.360 --> 03:15.113
You cannot put a price
on Entspannung.

03:15.200 --> 03:17.396
That's relaxation.

03:17.480 --> 03:20.632
Case in point, I'ma go take me
a dip in the honey jar.

03:21.440 --> 03:23.192
It's 8:00 in the morning.

03:23.280 --> 03:25.794
You drinking already?

03:25.880 --> 03:28.554
It's always 5:00 in prison.

03:39.800 --> 03:41.393
What the fuck?

03:47.960 --> 03:49.678
What's up?

03:49.760 --> 03:51.990
Yo!

03:52.080 --> 03:53.798
My honey's been jacked.

03:53.920 --> 03:57.311
<i>"Winnie the Pooh:
Tales from the Ghetto."</i>

03:57.400 --> 03:59.357
Man, these were full yesterday.

03:59.440 --> 04:00.999
Maybe some animal got to them.

04:01.080 --> 04:03.674
You forgetting we living
with a bunch of thieves.

04:05.720 --> 04:06.835
Hey, boss.

04:06.920 --> 04:09.833
I still haven't heard anything

04:09.920 --> 04:11.479
from these corporate guys
about our benefits.

04:11.560 --> 04:13.676
And I finally got
my prescription set up online,

04:13.760 --> 04:15.273
you know, with our old plan.

04:15.400 --> 04:18.392
Had to pay my niece 5O bucks
to help me figure it out.

04:18.480 --> 04:20.869
Please, please tell me there
aren't gonna be any changes.

04:20.959 --> 04:22.951
Haven't heard.

04:23.040 --> 04:26.670
C dorm got their new mattresses
this morning,

04:26.760 --> 04:30.230
plus stall doors
on all the bathrooms.

04:30.320 --> 04:32.960
Smoke and mirrors. I know it.

04:33.040 --> 04:35.350
And I don't trust it.

04:38.720 --> 04:41.155
Did you two
walk through the door

04:41.280 --> 04:44.352
into a paying job this morning?

04:44.440 --> 04:45.794
Uh-huh.

04:45.880 --> 04:47.837
You're welcome.

04:52.840 --> 04:54.592
Is everything all right?

04:54.680 --> 04:56.591
I needed to cool off.

04:56.680 --> 04:58.591
I'm sweating in places
I didn't even know that sweated.

04:58.680 --> 05:01.149
Well, stick an ice cube in
your bra and get back to work.

05:01.320 --> 05:03.834
I got to get these inventory
numbers to the new guys by 3:00.

05:03.920 --> 05:06.912
Where's Norma?
I thought she was helping.

05:16.920 --> 05:19.196
I wouldn't mind
handling a big hose.

05:20.520 --> 05:22.079
I hear they're setting up
a call center.

05:23.840 --> 05:26.878
With my sexy voice,
I'll be making mad commissions.

05:26.960 --> 05:28.519
Commissions. Right.

05:28.640 --> 05:31.234
You get ten percent of nothing
on every nothing you nothing.

05:31.320 --> 05:33.630
Look, nobody here
is applying to the new job.

05:33.720 --> 05:35.119
Comprende?

05:36.600 --> 05:38.830
We got a good thing going here.

05:41.560 --> 05:45.235
Norma! One potato, two potato.
Start counting.

05:45.360 --> 05:47.317
And the rest of you
start slicing carrots,

05:47.400 --> 05:50.870
and be grateful that you're not
scrubbing toilets no more.

05:52.720 --> 05:54.358
What you got there?

05:55.880 --> 05:57.871
Oh, you busting out
on your own now?

05:58.000 --> 05:59.559
No. Right.

05:59.640 --> 06:01.950
Go count that with the others.

06:02.040 --> 06:03.519
Vamos!

06:03.600 --> 06:05.398
I need numbers!

06:06.640 --> 06:08.074
What if it turns out
to be, like,

06:08.160 --> 06:09.434
picking up trash
on the side of the road?

06:09.520 --> 06:11.193
They don't pay that much
for dummy work.

06:11.280 --> 06:14.955
Nah, whatever it is, it's gonna
take skills and smarts.

06:15.040 --> 06:16.951
Yeah, what are you gonna
wow them with,

06:17.040 --> 06:18.838
your eyeliner skills
or your smarts

06:18.920 --> 06:22.117
about how many words rhyme
with "bleak" in emo songs?

06:22.200 --> 06:23.520
Fuck you
and your stupid sad face.

06:23.600 --> 06:25.671
We didn't
take your baby away, okay?

06:25.760 --> 06:27.478
Oh, yeah? You should shut up
about shit you don't know about.

06:27.560 --> 06:28.595
- You should shut up.
- Hey!

06:28.680 --> 06:29.909
You know,
at least I got ambition.

06:43.520 --> 06:45.477
You, go scrub some pans.

06:45.560 --> 06:47.915
What? Gross!
She started this shit!

06:48.000 --> 06:48.990
Now!

06:50.440 --> 06:52.716
I'm so done
with this depressing-ass place.

06:56.000 --> 06:58.037
I just really miss you.

06:58.120 --> 06:59.554
I'm so jealous.

06:59.640 --> 07:01.995
<i>Oh, baby, it's work.
And it's fuckin' Ke$ha.</i>

07:02.080 --> 07:04.230
<i>You're not missing anything,
seriously.</i>

07:04.360 --> 07:06.510
When you gonna let me
sell with you?

07:06.600 --> 07:07.954
Or sell my own stuff?

07:08.040 --> 07:10.350
My phone bill is, like,
crazy every month.

07:10.440 --> 07:12.351
Just give me a little something.

07:12.440 --> 07:15.114
The kids at my school
are, like, dying for it.

07:15.200 --> 07:17.350
<i>If you need money
for your phone bill, I got you.</i>

07:17.440 --> 07:19.716
I want to make my own money.

07:19.800 --> 07:22.030
So I can buy you a present.

07:22.120 --> 07:24.430
<i>You're my present, baby.</i>

07:30.880 --> 07:32.757
I got to go, baby-

07:32.840 --> 07:34.990
- I love you.
- <i>I</i> love you, too.

08:14.880 --> 08:17.599
This is for a wedding?
It's got no back.

08:19.280 --> 08:22.398
It's Emma Stone's Golden Globe
dress... the peach one.

08:22.520 --> 08:24.830
But Mrs. Ramirez is like 57.

08:24.920 --> 08:26.638
She's still got a nice back.

08:27.360 --> 08:28.998
Looks really good.

08:31.400 --> 08:33.676
I know. I do good work.

08:33.760 --> 08:35.592
But even if I didn't...

08:37.159 --> 08:39.470
I'm gonna sew
a Calvin Klein label on it.

08:39.559 --> 08:42.359
So now you're Theresa Gonzales
for Calvin Klein?

08:42.440 --> 08:46.434
Hey, more often than not, people
believe what you tell them.

08:52.920 --> 08:57.630
What's all this scuttlebutt
with the new job assignment?

08:57.720 --> 08:59.074
"Scuttlebutt"?

08:59.160 --> 09:01.037
The gossip. The lowdown.

09:01.120 --> 09:02.838
The 411.

09:02.920 --> 09:05.196
Oh.

09:05.280 --> 09:07.237
Someone said
it was a party-planning job.

09:07.320 --> 09:09.436
I stopped listening after that.

09:09.560 --> 09:14.031
Electrical sucks without
Nicky's running commentary.

09:14.120 --> 09:18.353
I wouldn't...
mind a new job assignment.

09:20.080 --> 09:21.718
Is my look off-putting?

09:21.800 --> 09:22.949
Off-putting?

09:23.080 --> 09:26.232
Harsh, scary.

09:26.320 --> 09:28.152
Not pleasing.

09:34.600 --> 09:39.879
There is a certain...
hardness...

09:39.960 --> 09:44.193
to your overall... thing.

09:45.840 --> 09:48.912
Listen to you,
being frank and honest.

09:49.000 --> 09:50.434
Good.

09:50.520 --> 09:52.875
Now tell me
how to soften things.

09:52.960 --> 09:54.871
I thought
that you and Dmitri were kaput.

09:54.960 --> 09:57.839
That was not an invitation
to pry into my life.

09:57.920 --> 10:00.355
Little beauty advice
is all I'm after.

10:00.440 --> 10:03.080
Beauty comes from the inside.

10:04.720 --> 10:09.794
However... smudging the corner
of your eyeliner,

10:09.920 --> 10:13.197
not spiking your hair,

10:13.280 --> 10:17.069
and a lighter lip couldn't hurt.

10:29.640 --> 10:30.869
Hey, Pearson.

10:30.960 --> 10:32.155
Morning.

10:32.240 --> 10:34.629
You know, "Danny" is fine.

10:37.160 --> 10:40.312
Oh, well, we... we mostly use
last names around here.

10:40.400 --> 10:41.595
Cool. Cool. Yeah.

10:41.680 --> 10:43.239
Whatever you think makes sense.

10:46.440 --> 10:48.033
You need to go?

10:48.120 --> 10:49.679
Oh, no. No.

10:49.760 --> 10:54.391
I just... <i>l-|-l</i> had my hands...
had to wash my hands.

10:54.480 --> 10:57.552
Sometimes I need to count five
metal objects before I can pee.

10:57.640 --> 10:58.960
Huh?

10:59.040 --> 11:01.395
Door hinge, door hinge,
flusher, tap, faucet.

11:01.480 --> 11:02.834
Got this place wired.

11:02.920 --> 11:03.990
After you.

11:04.080 --> 11:06.594
Oh. Sure.

11:08.680 --> 11:11.069
Y-you guys fired the warden.

11:11.160 --> 11:13.117
That was a surprise.

11:13.200 --> 11:15.237
Yeah. Well,
we absorbed the position.

11:15.360 --> 11:16.953
Whatever that means.

11:17.040 --> 11:19.077
Like we... soaked him up or something.

11:19.160 --> 11:21.515
But good news for you,
though, is, uh, you know,

11:21.600 --> 11:23.511
you're our main man
on the ground.

11:23.600 --> 11:25.477
Everyone's been very happy
so far.

11:25.560 --> 11:27.039
Oh, great. Great.

11:27.120 --> 11:32.149
L-I... I was thinking,
maybe we could have a meeting,

11:32.240 --> 11:33.913
all of us, old, new,

11:34.000 --> 11:35.877
make... make sure
we're on the same page.

11:35.960 --> 11:37.359
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Sure, sure.

11:37.440 --> 11:38.999
No, I-l think
Jones or maybe Carson

11:39.080 --> 11:40.514
is setting
something like that up.

11:40.600 --> 11:42.352
Everyone's checking
their calendars.

11:42.440 --> 11:44.192
Takes forever,
you know what I mean?

11:44.280 --> 11:46.351
Just, like, everyone wants to be
the alpha dog.

11:46.440 --> 11:47.669
"This time, that time, woof!"

11:47.760 --> 11:50.559
But, uh, I'll make
the call on it soon.

11:50.640 --> 11:52.119
You'll make the call?

11:52.200 --> 11:53.952
Yeah. Yeah, I'll let you know.

11:54.040 --> 11:56.509
Mr. Caputo...

11:59.000 --> 12:00.399
...I made these for you.

12:00.480 --> 12:01.914
Look at that.

12:02.000 --> 12:03.877
Any word
on that new job situation?

12:03.960 --> 12:06.190
Unconfirmed, Black. Keep moving.

12:06.280 --> 12:07.839
Fine.

12:07.920 --> 12:10.070
But I want you to know

12:10.160 --> 12:11.594
that I have a wide array
of talents

12:11.720 --> 12:13.631
besides the criminal
and papier-machÃ© variety.

12:13.720 --> 12:15.996
Oh, I am sure you do.

12:16.080 --> 12:17.991
Okay.

12:18.080 --> 12:22.233
How do they, uh,
know about the job?

12:22.320 --> 12:25.153
Well, you... you're renovating
a building out there

12:25.240 --> 12:27.197
that's been empty
since the '90s.

12:27.280 --> 12:29.954
Any sniff
in a break in the monotony,

12:30.040 --> 12:32.156
and these girls are all over it.

12:32.240 --> 12:34.834
In fact,
that was one of the things

12:34.920 --> 12:37.480
I was hoping
we could all discuss.

12:37.560 --> 12:40.074
You throw off
the whole prison economy

12:40.160 --> 12:41.719
when you introduce a job

12:41.800 --> 12:44.360
that's paying
ten times the going rate.

12:44.440 --> 12:46.397
I mean, it could get ugly.

12:46.480 --> 12:47.959
Yeah, I could see that.

12:48.040 --> 12:49.917
Well, we, uh, we have a system

12:50.000 --> 12:52.753
that I think will, uh,
limit the ugliness.

12:52.840 --> 12:54.558
- A system.
- Yeah.

12:54.640 --> 12:58.349
That's great. Well, maybe...
maybe we can talk more about that?

12:58.440 --> 13:00.511
Sure. Yeah. Talk right now.

13:00.600 --> 13:05.310
Go up to my office, could pour us
a couple big glasses of water.

13:05.400 --> 13:07.994
- I...
- You have to pee, don't you?

13:08.080 --> 13:11.789
- Very much so.
- All right. To be continued.

13:11.880 --> 13:14.156
Okay, Okay-

13:19.440 --> 13:20.635
- Hello.
- Red.

13:20.720 --> 13:22.597
Were you coming by to see me?

13:22.680 --> 13:25.911
Came in for a drink of water.
It's a beautiful day.

13:26.000 --> 13:28.560
Is it? I was stuck inside
doing paperwork.

13:29.200 --> 13:30.474
Who's the real prisoner?

13:30.560 --> 13:32.153
Still me... I think.

13:34.120 --> 13:36.031
Hey, y-you look...

13:36.120 --> 13:38.953
I don't know. You look lighter.

13:39.040 --> 13:40.360
I feel lighter.

13:40.440 --> 13:43.239
The new regime has fixed
all the soap dispensers.

13:43.320 --> 13:46.836
Feels like opportunities
are sprouting up all around us.

13:46.920 --> 13:48.319
It's funny that you say that.

13:48.400 --> 13:50.232
Just the other day,
I was talking to some--

13:50.320 --> 13:51.594
Hey, Healy,
I got a question for you.

13:51.680 --> 13:53.956
- Reznikov, is it?
- Red.

13:54.040 --> 13:56.190
Berdie. Sorry to interrupt.

13:56.280 --> 13:58.271
Do you know who I can get
to drill a hole in my desk?

13:58.360 --> 14:00.078
I want to run my lamp
and computer cords through

14:00.160 --> 14:01.833
so they're not all
hanging out there, you know?

14:01.920 --> 14:03.558
When you need
something like that done,

14:03.640 --> 14:05.950
it needs to be cleared
through admin first.

14:06.040 --> 14:08.031
What? That's silly.
Who's on maintenance crew?

14:08.120 --> 14:10.555
You're on your own
with this one.

14:10.640 --> 14:12.790
Come on. Give me a name.

14:12.880 --> 14:15.793
Try Bortolino or Wiggins.
They'll be able to help you.

14:15.880 --> 14:17.632
Awesome. Thank you.

14:17.720 --> 14:19.199
You should come visit me, Red.

14:19.280 --> 14:21.430
Check out my clean,
cordless environment.

14:21.520 --> 14:22.715
We'll have a cup of tea.

14:22.880 --> 14:25.076
See you later, Healy.

14:25.160 --> 14:27.595
Not enjoying
your new colleague, hm?

14:27.720 --> 14:30.280
She's perky.
I mean, who's that perky?

14:30.360 --> 14:32.636
I agree. Perk is for coffee.

14:32.720 --> 14:34.677
It's deplorable in people.

14:35.880 --> 14:37.632
You missed a button.

14:44.000 --> 14:47.436
There you go.
Now you're perfect.

14:47.520 --> 14:49.113
Thank you.

14:51.520 --> 14:55.275
L-I was just gonna go and, uh...

14:55.360 --> 14:59.069
...get myself a perky cup of coffee
in the break room.

15:00.960 --> 15:02.519
Well, don't drink too much.

15:02.600 --> 15:05.274
Coffee can inflame the lining
of the small intestine

15:05.360 --> 15:06.998
and lead to irritable bowels.

15:09.080 --> 15:11.435
I'll... keep that in mind.

15:18.960 --> 15:21.759
You know what some cultures
do to people who steal eggs?

15:21.840 --> 15:24.150
They cut their hands off.

15:24.240 --> 15:30.475
According to my last count,
you owe me four fucking hands.

15:32.080 --> 15:34.310
When I helped you out
with the Vee situation,

15:34.400 --> 15:36.630
we had a little
cross-cultural understanding.

15:36.720 --> 15:38.791
But I don't remember
giving you permission

15:38.920 --> 15:42.470
to set up your own shop,
magic Norma.

15:42.560 --> 15:44.119
Especially not for free
and especially

15:44.200 --> 15:46.077
when you don't know
what the fuck you're doing.

15:46.160 --> 15:49.630
Santeria is some serious shit.

15:49.760 --> 15:52.400
You start messing around,
you piss off the orishas...

15:52.480 --> 15:54.471
Mira! I...

15:54.560 --> 15:57.074
I don't need that on me.

15:57.160 --> 15:59.037
And that's why...

15:59.120 --> 16:00.599
I'm gonna take back...

16:02.320 --> 16:04.231
...my candle.

16:04.320 --> 16:06.516
Oh, look... my eggs.

16:06.600 --> 16:08.352
My beads.

16:08.440 --> 16:09.794
My honey-

16:09.880 --> 16:12.520
This ain't your history.

16:12.600 --> 16:14.477
It ain't your culture.

16:14.560 --> 16:16.039
It stops now.

16:21.240 --> 16:22.469
Fine. You can keep the honey.

16:22.560 --> 16:24.358
But it's for eating only.

16:24.440 --> 16:26.556
I see you anointing anything
with this,

16:26.640 --> 16:28.995
it's gonna be the last
sweet thing in your life.

16:34.520 --> 16:38.639
<i>Prisoner maintenance
detail to the cell room.</i>

16:41.880 --> 16:44.474
I don't care what Gloria says.
I'm going for it.

16:44.560 --> 16:47.154
Gonna kill that interview
like I did job fair.

16:47.240 --> 16:48.719
But you lost job fair.

16:48.800 --> 16:50.791
Yeah, but this time,
there won't be an audience

16:50.880 --> 16:52.553
so they won't get all, like, PC

16:52.640 --> 16:55.314
and give it to that fat mayate
so she don't get all sad.

16:55.400 --> 16:57.277
Gloria's right, though.

16:57.360 --> 16:58.839
It's good, all of us together.

16:58.920 --> 17:01.309
Who knows who they'll stick in
to replace you?

17:01.400 --> 17:03.994
What if she's mean
or likes Coldplay or something?

17:04.079 --> 17:05.434
It's all gelling right now.

17:05.520 --> 17:07.511
So, I'm supposed to put on
that feo hairnet

17:07.599 --> 17:10.194
and scrub pots and pans
every day because it's gelling?

17:10.280 --> 17:11.599
I'm so much better than that.

17:11.680 --> 17:13.000
You saying
you're better than me?

17:13.079 --> 17:14.559
No! You're good, too.

17:14.640 --> 17:17.678
All I'm saying
is that I got aspirations.

17:17.760 --> 17:19.671
I always have, even in here.

17:19.760 --> 17:22.593
You know, when I wear that apron
in the kitchen,

17:22.680 --> 17:24.751
I'm really wearing it
ironically.

17:24.839 --> 17:26.353
Wow.

17:26.480 --> 17:28.710
I had no idea.

17:28.800 --> 17:32.430
So, I thought, I got to do like
my morn and just knock it off.

17:32.520 --> 17:34.352
You can do, like, chemistry?

17:34.440 --> 17:36.113
Nah, nah.

17:36.240 --> 17:38.277
Not even.

17:38.360 --> 17:40.317
<i>So, I found, like,
blotter clip art,</i>

17:40.400 --> 17:43.870
<i>I printed it out,
I wet it a little bit.</i>

17:44.000 --> 17:46.833
<i>Then I blow-dried it,
made little squares,</i>

17:46.960 --> 17:50.351
<i>and I was in business
selling fake designer acid.</i>

17:50.440 --> 17:51.874
Brought it to the game
on Friday.

17:51.960 --> 17:53.837
- By halftime, sold out.
- What?

17:53.920 --> 17:56.514
I made some more yesterday...
little cherries. So cute.

17:56.600 --> 17:59.638
And check it...
bought me some flatforms.

17:59.720 --> 18:01.040
Those are cute.

18:01.120 --> 18:03.270
They're like
flats and platforms in one.

18:03.360 --> 18:05.920
Wow. That's why they're called
flatforms, dumb-ass.

18:06.920 --> 18:08.319
Yo, Marisol.

18:09.600 --> 18:11.398
Hey, Arturo.

18:11.480 --> 18:12.754
Arturo's friends.

18:12.840 --> 18:14.877
Willy said
he saw green alien guys

18:14.960 --> 18:16.997
when he was tripping
on your shit.

18:17.080 --> 18:18.400
They were leprechauns.

18:18.480 --> 18:20.551
Dude, "aliens" sounds
so much cooler.

18:20.640 --> 18:22.870
But they had little hats.

18:22.960 --> 18:24.712
Aliens can't have little hats

18:24.800 --> 18:27.235
because of their antennas
or whatever.

18:27.320 --> 18:29.391
Do you think
you could hook us up again?

18:29.480 --> 18:31.312
My boy Jason here
wants to try it.

18:31.400 --> 18:33.232
Lately, he's been kind of down.

18:33.320 --> 18:35.391
Yeah, I could hook you up.

18:35.480 --> 18:39.075
But remember,
it's not for escaping reality.

18:39.160 --> 18:41.913
It's for, like, embracing it.

18:42.840 --> 18:44.035
Yes, ma'am.

18:53.000 --> 18:55.833
Oh, my God.
It's totally working.

18:55.920 --> 18:57.399
People will believe
what you tell them.

18:57.480 --> 18:58.470
Until they don't.

18:58.560 --> 19:00.517
Someone's gonna come back pissed

19:00.600 --> 19:03.274
and ask for a refund or punch
you in the face or something.

19:03.360 --> 19:04.555
No,no,no,no,no.

19:04.640 --> 19:06.916
If they come back,
I say, "hold up.

19:07.040 --> 19:08.633
What happened when you took it?"

19:08.720 --> 19:11.951
And if they say, "nothing,"
I say, "What is nothing?"

19:12.040 --> 19:13.439
Because some people say
there was nothing

19:13.520 --> 19:14.999
when the universe was created,

19:15.080 --> 19:18.596
but, like, isn't empty space
still something?

19:18.680 --> 19:21.672
Open your mind
to the possibilities.

19:21.760 --> 19:23.512
Maybe you're not
doing it right."

19:23.640 --> 19:24.994
And then they come back

19:25.080 --> 19:27.230
because they feel like
they didn't do it right.

19:27.320 --> 19:29.152
Girl,
I thought this shit through.

19:29.240 --> 19:32.278
- You're such a mad genius.
- Yep.

19:32.400 --> 19:35.472
Look at you. 'Round and 'round.

19:35.560 --> 19:38.757
'Round all around. That's nice.

19:38.840 --> 19:41.480
Just get to it.
Did you find him?

19:41.560 --> 19:46.077
Daya, that fucker hobbled away
into the sunset.

19:46.200 --> 19:47.759
I got into his house.

19:47.840 --> 19:51.037
Nothing left
except some shitty clothes.

19:51.120 --> 19:53.634
Found a mug in the sink
that looked like a grenade.

19:53.720 --> 19:56.075
I thought that was cool.
I saved that for you.

19:56.200 --> 19:57.838
But he's gone.

20:00.400 --> 20:03.677
Daya, fuck that guy.

20:03.760 --> 20:05.717
You're better off.

20:07.200 --> 20:08.998
He had one leg.

20:09.080 --> 20:13.677
I mean, you go around
losing body parts,

20:13.760 --> 20:16.195
that's some
pretty irresponsible shit.

20:16.280 --> 20:18.920
I was such a bitch.

20:19.000 --> 20:20.718
I drove him away.

20:20.800 --> 20:24.350
You have a life
growing inside of you.

20:24.440 --> 20:28.399
That makes you say and do
all kinds of crazy shit

20:28.480 --> 20:30.073
that make no sense.

20:30.160 --> 20:33.118
But a real man knows
he has to suck it up

20:33.240 --> 20:35.277
and take it for nine months.

20:35.360 --> 20:38.079
Maybe you get a little
side action if need be.

20:39.360 --> 20:41.033
But you don't split.

20:42.520 --> 20:46.275
Even your loser father
stuck around till you was two.

20:47.600 --> 20:49.273
The leaving is on him.

20:49.360 --> 20:50.839
That's not on you.

20:52.320 --> 20:54.550
So, what's gonna happen now?

20:56.560 --> 20:58.278
You're gonna take the baby, right?

21:03.080 --> 21:04.753
Daya, I love you
and I love your mother,

21:04.840 --> 21:07.400
but shit is real hard
out here, okay?

21:07.480 --> 21:10.120
And then your holy abuela,
you know,

21:10.200 --> 21:13.955
she hookin' up with some old
dude that she met at tai chi.

21:14.040 --> 21:16.190
Hardly ever see her anymore.

21:17.560 --> 21:18.789
Christina.

21:18.920 --> 21:22.151
Christina got
some decent mommy skills.

21:22.280 --> 21:25.159
Maybe she can take care
of the baby for a little while.

21:25.280 --> 21:26.759
She's in junior high.

21:26.840 --> 21:27.989
So what?

21:28.080 --> 21:29.593
Junior high will still be there.

21:29.680 --> 21:32.991
Plus, she's already done,
what, two years?

21:33.080 --> 21:37.313
Yo, it's all good.
It's all good.

21:37.440 --> 21:39.477
I actually thought he loved me.

21:39.560 --> 21:41.437
And he probably did, Daya.

21:41.520 --> 21:45.229
All guys love you... because
you're such a good girl.

21:46.240 --> 21:47.719
But you know what?

21:47.800 --> 21:52.715
Sometimes
love ain't stronger than dÃ©bil.

21:54.000 --> 21:56.560
That guy was a bitch.

21:56.640 --> 22:01.271
This inside me, it feels like
a grenade right now.

22:01.360 --> 22:06.389
And soon, it's gonna blow up
and take me with it.

22:06.480 --> 22:08.710
It's not a mug.

22:11.480 --> 22:14.120
My poor baby, man.

22:15.800 --> 22:18.110
I'm sorry, Daya.

22:18.200 --> 22:19.952
If it makes you feel any better,

22:20.040 --> 22:22.077
next time I see
that motherfucker,

22:22.160 --> 22:24.629
I'm gonna rape his ass
with a broken bottle

22:24.720 --> 22:27.872
and I'm gonna shoot him in
the stomach so he bleeds slow.

22:27.960 --> 22:29.473
That, I'm gonna do for you.

22:29.560 --> 22:30.834
Thank you.

22:30.920 --> 22:33.355
You're welcome.

22:35.120 --> 22:37.999
You need to complete
the test in 12 minutes.

22:38.080 --> 22:40.151
Twelve minutes.

22:40.240 --> 22:41.992
Be honest with your answers.

22:42.080 --> 22:45.675
And all pencils must be returned
at the end of the test.

22:45.800 --> 22:49.430
If you do not return your
pencils, you will be given a...

22:49.520 --> 22:51.796
<i>- Present.
- "shot.</i>

22:54.920 --> 22:57.150
Well, look who's here.

23:03.280 --> 23:04.953
A test?

23:05.040 --> 23:06.030
Shit.

23:06.120 --> 23:08.236
I fucking suck at taking tests.

23:08.320 --> 23:10.197
I get all itchy and anxious.

23:10.280 --> 23:12.715
Can't think straight.

23:15.000 --> 23:18.789
Don't turn the test
over till I say "begin."

23:18.880 --> 23:22.271
Now I know they serious
about this job.

23:22.400 --> 23:23.549
Reading test?

23:23.640 --> 23:25.392
Damn!

23:25.480 --> 23:28.598
They probably got us building
warheads or some shit all day.

23:28.680 --> 23:31.877
You really think they'll have
felons making weapons?

23:31.960 --> 23:33.359
I don't know.

23:33.440 --> 23:36.353
I heard the new guys
are military contractors.

23:36.440 --> 23:38.954
I'm sure they up to some evil.

23:39.040 --> 23:43.113
Have us making napalm
or... or... or...

23:43.200 --> 23:45.032
...weaponizing smallpox.

23:46.800 --> 23:48.757
Well, whatever it is,
we gonna be leaving up in here

23:48.840 --> 23:50.831
with fish gills
and extra fingers.

23:50.920 --> 23:52.877
That's not how mutation works.

23:52.960 --> 23:54.712
Oh, really? How's it work?

23:54.800 --> 23:56.120
Our babies would the ones

23:56.200 --> 23:58.237
born with the fish gills
and extra fingers.

23:58.320 --> 24:01.153
What we'd have is a bunch of
different cancers and lesions.

24:01.240 --> 24:02.435
Shit like that.

24:02.520 --> 24:04.670
Y'all so worried,
don't take the test.

24:04.760 --> 24:06.831
It gives me a better chance.

24:06.920 --> 24:09.480
It still make 89 cent more
than the warehouse.

24:09.560 --> 24:13.155
Got my eye on that $16 fan
in commissary.

24:13.240 --> 24:15.516
Or you can just use
your extra-finger hand

24:15.640 --> 24:16.789
that you gonna have.

24:16.880 --> 24:18.553
All right, ladies.

24:18.640 --> 24:19.869
You may begin.

24:25.240 --> 24:27.072
What the fuck?

24:27.160 --> 24:30.710
"True or false: Ideas are more
important that real things"?

24:30.800 --> 24:33.838
<i>We</i> are <i>not supposed to
discuss the questions.</i>

24:33.920 --> 24:35.718
Check out question three.

24:35.800 --> 24:39.759
"Agree or disagree:
Most people are brave."

24:39.840 --> 24:41.353
Now, my thoughts on bravery

24:41.480 --> 24:44.916
are supposed to tell them
I'm a good employee how?

24:47.680 --> 24:50.274
So easy.

24:53.080 --> 24:55.071
All right. Okay.

24:55.160 --> 25:00.155
"I can feel overcome
with wonder in nature."

25:00.240 --> 25:03.915
Yeah, well, I can feel that way,
but I shouldn't say that, right?

25:04.000 --> 25:06.879
I mean, no one wants
a tree-hugger working for them.

25:08.280 --> 25:11.398
Unless they're
one of those soc-companies

25:11.520 --> 25:14.876
that makes, like, bamboo forks.

25:14.960 --> 25:16.633
What have you guys heard?

25:16.720 --> 25:19.155
Quiet, ladies.

25:23.120 --> 25:24.997
Let's make a deal
that if one of us gets it

25:25.080 --> 25:27.720
and the other one doesn't,
then we don't take it.

25:27.800 --> 25:30.030
Like you even need
to say anything.

25:30.120 --> 25:31.269
Good.

25:35.960 --> 25:40.750
"I spend most of my time
trying to understand things."

25:42.160 --> 25:44.720
"lspendn.

25:44.800 --> 25:47.519
...most of my time...

25:47.600 --> 25:51.798
...trying...
to understand things."

25:51.880 --> 25:52.870
What are they getting at?

25:52.960 --> 25:54.758
Will you shut up?
I'm trying to concentrate.

25:55.280 --> 25:59.353
"Ibeheve
people are basically moral."

26:00.200 --> 26:01.713
Agree.

26:02.920 --> 26:04.638
You're supposed to
answer honest.

26:04.720 --> 26:06.154
I do believe that.

26:11.040 --> 26:13.111
You got to think deeper
than that.

26:13.200 --> 26:15.635
People want to be good.

26:15.760 --> 26:17.558
They really do, deep down.

26:19.200 --> 26:20.713
But they just fuck up.

26:24.680 --> 26:27.115
I thought they were gonna, like,
be interviewing us.

26:27.200 --> 26:29.157
Not giving us
some weird-ass brain test.

26:29.240 --> 26:30.878
Quiet, Gonzales.

26:37.400 --> 26:41.917
Would you say
that I keep in the background?

26:42.000 --> 26:43.593
I'm having a hard enough time

26:43.680 --> 26:46.035
figuring out these questions
for myself.

26:46.120 --> 26:48.680
What, I got to answer yours now, too?
Please.

26:48.760 --> 26:50.273
Sorry.

26:52.600 --> 26:54.557
I'm gonna go with "yes."

26:54.640 --> 26:56.392
I keep in the background.

26:56.480 --> 26:57.993
My mother always said

26:58.080 --> 27:00.799
that silence can be
the loudest thing.

27:00.880 --> 27:03.599
But she never shut the fuck up.

27:03.680 --> 27:05.478
Oh, lordy, this is hard.

27:05.640 --> 27:08.075
Quiet down, ladies.

27:10.640 --> 27:11.755
H6)'-

27:11.840 --> 27:13.399
What'd you put for 15?

27:13.480 --> 27:15.630
I'm blowing it.

27:17.040 --> 27:19.680
See? Now I'm getting all itchy.

27:19.760 --> 27:21.671
- Shh!
- You shh!

27:22.880 --> 27:24.553
Oh, my God.

27:24.640 --> 27:26.153
Who can concentrate in here?

27:26.240 --> 27:28.550
Gonzales, you're done.

27:28.640 --> 27:31.234
- I didn't finish yet.
- Yes, you're done.

27:31.320 --> 27:33.550
Hand over your test
and your pencil.

27:40.720 --> 27:42.199
I don't speak Spanish,

27:42.280 --> 27:45.796
so I'm gonna assume
you said, "Have a nice day."

27:55.680 --> 27:57.034
Fuck you.

27:57.120 --> 27:59.396
Another one bites the dust.

28:01.880 --> 28:03.518
Want to help me
spend some money?

28:03.600 --> 28:05.352
What happened
to saving for a car?

28:05.440 --> 28:07.954
I think I need to invest in
some more emotional clothing...

28:08.080 --> 28:09.514
...right now, you know?

28:09.600 --> 28:10.920
And worry about the car later.

28:11.040 --> 28:12.792
I need to dress
for my authentic self.

28:12.920 --> 28:14.069
And for Ian.

28:14.160 --> 28:15.480
- Yeah.
- Oh, what the fuck?!

28:15.560 --> 28:16.880
You see me now?

28:16.960 --> 28:19.520
Because I see me.

28:19.600 --> 28:21.079
It's Jason.
I think he's fucked up.

28:21.160 --> 28:22.480
I'm like a self-mirror.

28:24.040 --> 28:26.077
I am silver and shimmery.

28:26.160 --> 28:27.958
Jason, you fucking idiot!

28:28.040 --> 28:31.635
I'm failing Math
and Western Civ.

28:31.720 --> 28:33.472
Everybody's failing western civ!

28:33.560 --> 28:34.789
How did he even get up there?

28:34.880 --> 28:36.109
Fuck it.

28:47.040 --> 28:48.792
You should plant some kale.

28:48.880 --> 28:50.871
I hear it's become very popular.

28:50.960 --> 28:54.112
The stuff that stays all clay
on a deli platter?

28:54.200 --> 28:56.316
That's a garnish,
not something to eat.

28:56.400 --> 29:00.234
It's supposed to be
loaded with vitamins.

29:00.320 --> 29:02.675
You were right.

29:02.800 --> 29:05.189
Gorgeous day.

29:05.280 --> 29:07.556
Hey, there, Jones,
you old string bean.

29:07.680 --> 29:08.954
Hello.

29:09.040 --> 29:10.713
Speaking of string beans,

29:10.800 --> 29:14.111
Jones has some requests
for the vegetable garden.

29:14.200 --> 29:16.396
Now, don't go getting
any funny ideas with me now,

29:16.480 --> 29:17.834
you old burner.

29:17.920 --> 29:20.560
I do know what
a wacky tobacky leaf looks like.

29:22.040 --> 29:24.634
Excuse me.
I have somewhere nicer to be.

29:24.760 --> 29:26.159
Oh, no.

29:26.240 --> 29:29.631
Stay. Have a little more
fun with us.

29:29.760 --> 29:32.878
- Sit.
- Such fun.

29:33.000 --> 29:35.833
Yeah, I was
at a hippie music festival once.

29:35.960 --> 29:38.395
Must have been, like, ten or so.

29:38.480 --> 29:42.030
Mother was away, and my older
brother was in charge of me.

29:42.120 --> 29:44.589
His buddies and I,
we hitchhiked there.

29:44.720 --> 29:46.597
Healy... such a rebel.

29:46.720 --> 29:49.599
Oh, no. No.
I was scared out of my mind.

29:49.680 --> 29:53.594
For two days, I was living with
a golf ball stuck in my throat,

29:53.680 --> 29:55.239
choking back the tears.

29:55.320 --> 29:56.879
It was absolute chaos.

29:56.960 --> 29:59.190
Pouring rain...
nobody seemed to care.

29:59.280 --> 30:01.112
And people
just kept wandering around.

30:01.200 --> 30:04.272
They were dancing completely
naked, filthy with the mud.

30:04.360 --> 30:06.237
It was, like, unbelievable.

30:06.320 --> 30:07.879
Were you at Woodstock?

30:07.960 --> 30:09.439
Somewhere upstate.

30:09.520 --> 30:12.558
Plus, somebody stole
my Johnny Unitas football.

30:12.640 --> 30:15.712
I never wanted to be home
so badly.

30:15.800 --> 30:17.598
You guys understand that, right?

30:17.680 --> 30:20.433
Sounds like it was
very traumatizing for you.

30:22.200 --> 30:23.713
I don't know.

30:25.480 --> 30:27.949
My brother,
he's an insurance appraiser now.

30:29.640 --> 30:32.439
Mostly boats
and other watercraft.

30:33.600 --> 30:35.432
This is nice.

30:36.120 --> 30:38.236
Fresh air...

30:39.320 --> 30:40.390
...good company-.

30:46.640 --> 30:48.039
So, she wants this.

30:48.120 --> 30:50.236
Does that look edible to you?

30:50.320 --> 30:52.834
- How you think you did?
- Who can tell?

30:53.840 --> 30:55.831
Come on! We just got started.

30:55.920 --> 30:58.480
Man, I pluck my chin hairs.
Ain't that upkeep enough?

30:58.560 --> 31:02.315
- Got to run, too?
- Mind, body.

31:03.640 --> 31:05.313
You know
what I'm just now realizing?

31:05.400 --> 31:08.233
I'm pretty damn happy
with both those departments.

31:08.320 --> 31:09.674
I'm walking.

31:09.760 --> 31:11.080
Come on!

31:11.160 --> 31:13.595
To the greenhouse,
then we can slow it down.

31:13.680 --> 31:14.829
Let's g0!

31:14.920 --> 31:16.831
Man, if I sweat my hair out...

31:16.920 --> 31:18.240
Come on! Let's go!

31:18.320 --> 31:20.118
Titties flapping everywhere.

31:20.200 --> 31:21.873
Please tell me
that's a margarita.

31:21.960 --> 31:23.758
Yeah. Lemonade.

31:23.880 --> 31:26.110
Made from the finest
powdered ingredients

31:26.200 --> 31:27.713
the commissary has to offer.

31:29.080 --> 31:30.673
With the pink sweetener,
not the blue.

31:30.760 --> 31:31.909
Nice!

31:34.800 --> 31:36.393
Thank you.

31:36.480 --> 31:40.439
God, I've been laying manure
for the last four hours.

31:40.520 --> 31:42.830
The latest rumor is
that our new corporate overlords

31:42.960 --> 31:46.351
are gonna be testing
genetically modified wheat out here.

31:46.440 --> 31:50.593
See? Who says prison doesn't
prepare you for the outside world?

31:52.200 --> 31:54.271
You know,
when we get out of here,

31:54.360 --> 31:56.954
I could find electrical work,
you could landscape.

31:57.040 --> 31:59.793
We could drive a pickup truck.

31:59.920 --> 32:01.957
We would be
living lesbian stereotypes.

32:02.040 --> 32:06.113
We could stop shaving
and start camping.

32:06.200 --> 32:09.670
We could go to golf tournaments.

32:10.520 --> 32:12.397
No? No.

32:12.480 --> 32:13.629
No golf.

32:13.720 --> 32:15.313
Who's that girl?

32:15.400 --> 32:17.471
She's not in orange,
so she's not new.

32:17.560 --> 32:19.790
I've never seen her before,

32:19.920 --> 32:21.718
and then today,
twice in one day.

32:21.800 --> 32:23.313
It's a prison phenomenon.

32:23.400 --> 32:24.913
It's, like, when you think
you've seen everyone,

32:25.000 --> 32:27.958
you suddenly notice
that there's a girl

32:28.040 --> 32:31.635
with a port-wine birthmark
on her face

32:31.760 --> 32:35.754
that has been working with you
in electrical since you got here

32:35.840 --> 32:37.831
and you'd never seen her before.

32:37.960 --> 32:40.873
No. That phenomenon
is called "self-absorbed."

32:44.160 --> 32:46.959
Seriously,
something is up with her.

32:47.040 --> 32:48.633
She's super-sketchy.

32:48.720 --> 32:50.438
And clearly her Disney princess
is Jasmine.

32:53.880 --> 32:57.316
Look. Look.
She just looked at me.

33:00.200 --> 33:01.838
Twice in one day
out of nowhere, Piper?

33:02.000 --> 33:03.752
It's weird.

33:03.840 --> 33:06.150
And he knows that I'm in here.

33:08.440 --> 33:11.637
So... so, you're saying
that Kubra found a girl

33:11.760 --> 33:13.512
who was headed to prison...

33:13.600 --> 33:17.150
...or, better yet,
convinced someone

33:17.240 --> 33:21.677
to get arrested, charged,
sent to prison,

33:21.760 --> 33:23.876
and then manipulated it

33:24.000 --> 33:28.437
so that they would be
assigned here specifically

33:28.520 --> 33:30.591
so they could get you?

33:30.680 --> 33:34.116
I'm telling you, he's twisted.

33:34.240 --> 33:35.992
He plays the long game.

33:36.080 --> 33:37.354
He's too smart to send in a girl

33:37.440 --> 33:38.919
who looks like
she's From Cyprus.

33:39.000 --> 33:40.877
That's a rookie move.

33:41.000 --> 33:42.957
You're...
you're a paranoid racist.

33:43.080 --> 33:45.276
She probably just thinks
you're cute.

33:46.640 --> 33:49.439
But if she tries to hit on you,

33:49.520 --> 33:52.080
I will smack a bitch down.

34:01.960 --> 34:04.429
I've heard girls
talking about you,

34:04.560 --> 34:07.916
saying you can offer help.

34:08.040 --> 34:10.554
I'm in a pretty dark place.

34:12.239 --> 34:14.800
Is this, like, a guru situation?

34:16.679 --> 34:20.639
I went to see Amma once...
the hugging saint.

34:20.719 --> 34:23.234
Waited for three hours
to get hugged.

34:23.320 --> 34:26.152
But then
Seamus said he felt sick.

34:26.239 --> 34:29.516
Said it was from the sun
and the chia pudding,

34:29.600 --> 34:32.274
but I'm pretty sure
he just got impatient.

34:33.920 --> 34:36.389
I could have used that hug.

34:36.480 --> 34:39.074
I don't know why I didn't stay.

34:40.320 --> 34:42.038
Yes, I do.

34:42.120 --> 34:44.396
I didn't stay
so Seamus and Meadow

34:44.480 --> 34:47.677
could go back to the lake
and have sex and do slack line.

34:47.760 --> 34:49.512
So I missed my hug.

34:50.960 --> 34:53.190
Do those sound like
good friends to you?

34:53.320 --> 34:56.870
I mean... why don't I have
people in my life

34:56.960 --> 34:59.076
who really care about me?

35:03.760 --> 35:05.558
Maybe it's me.

35:05.640 --> 35:08.314
I've been lazy.

35:08.400 --> 35:12.519
But there are connections
to be made in here, right?

35:12.600 --> 35:14.989
I mean, I see people
who care about each other

35:15.120 --> 35:18.351
all over this place,
and they were all new once.

35:20.320 --> 35:24.154
Yeah. That makes sense.

35:30.760 --> 35:34.515
I get it.
This is your thing.

35:34.600 --> 35:36.910
You give people
this meaningful stare,

35:37.000 --> 35:39.594
and people project
their feelings onto it.

35:43.920 --> 35:45.274
It's really soothing.

35:47.520 --> 35:49.033
I feel better.

35:51.640 --> 35:53.313
Thank you.

36:00.080 --> 36:01.878
Inmates, no touching.

36:13.640 --> 36:15.517
Oh, thanks. Thanks for helping.

36:15.600 --> 36:18.638
Yeah, you steal from someone
who's giving it away for free,

36:18.720 --> 36:21.280
that's like
double negative karma.

36:21.360 --> 36:23.920
Yeah, it is pretty fucked up.

36:25.200 --> 36:27.760
You know this isn't gonna be ready
for like another week or so, right?

36:27.840 --> 36:30.195
- A week?
- Yeah.

36:33.040 --> 36:34.599
Fuck Rome.

36:38.480 --> 36:39.914
You got any suspects?

36:40.000 --> 36:41.877
You know, it could be Papadakis.

36:41.960 --> 36:44.474
I know a couple of girls
got sick off her shit.

36:44.560 --> 36:47.154
Yo, maybe she's trying to steal
my secret ingredient.

36:47.240 --> 36:48.469
- Cinnamon!
- Watermelon!

36:48.600 --> 36:50.159
No and no, all right?

36:50.240 --> 36:52.390
Fuck you. I ain't telling you.

36:52.520 --> 36:55.239
I think that squirrel's dead.

36:55.320 --> 36:57.675
He's just been laying up
in that branch this whole time.

37:03.280 --> 37:04.839
Yo, don't do that, man!

37:04.920 --> 37:06.831
She gonna come down,
come for your face

37:06.920 --> 37:08.399
and claw your eyes out and shit.

37:08.480 --> 37:10.949
My cousin had a ferret
who did that.

37:13.720 --> 37:16.553
That squirrel
is not giving one shit.

37:16.640 --> 37:18.358
Maybe he's retarded.

37:19.680 --> 37:21.318
Maybe he's drunk.

37:21.400 --> 37:23.516
What, you saying that little
thing is the hooch bandit?

37:24.640 --> 37:26.039
Come on, y'all.

37:26.120 --> 37:27.918
The bags are heavy,
they were buried deep.

37:28.000 --> 37:29.274
I don't think so.

37:29.360 --> 37:30.839
He's not that little.

37:30.920 --> 37:34.276
Maybe his daddy fucked a raccoon
and he's one of those hybrid species.

37:35.440 --> 37:36.635
A squacoon.

37:36.720 --> 37:38.677
His tail is
kind of stripey-like.

37:38.760 --> 37:40.353
Thank you.

37:40.440 --> 37:42.875
Squirrels and raccoons
can't mate, a'ight?

37:42.960 --> 37:45.554
They're, like,
two totally different species.

37:45.640 --> 37:47.995
Whatever he is,
I think he's your problem.

37:48.080 --> 37:50.151
You got to defend your stash.

37:50.280 --> 37:52.476
On the farm, my daddy used
pee and cayenne pepper

37:52.560 --> 37:53.880
to keep the skunks away.

37:58.000 --> 38:00.560
I suppose I should start out
by apologizing,

38:00.640 --> 38:04.679
which I've had to do a lot
through the years for George,

38:04.800 --> 38:07.792
although this one
really takes the cake.

38:07.880 --> 38:11.032
I suppose I shouldn't mention
cake, because you're probably--

38:11.120 --> 38:12.713
You can have it.

38:12.800 --> 38:14.154
It?

38:14.280 --> 38:15.873
The... the baby?

38:15.960 --> 38:17.234
I don't know
if it's a boy or a girl.

38:17.320 --> 38:18.754
It doesn't matter.

38:18.840 --> 38:20.638
Either way, I don't want it.

38:20.720 --> 38:22.472
My mom says
you have a real nice house

38:22.560 --> 38:24.278
so it'll have
its own room and stuff.

38:24.360 --> 38:25.953
Yes. That's true.

38:29.520 --> 38:30.510
You seem upset.

38:30.600 --> 38:32.637
I'm pregnant in prison, lady.

38:32.720 --> 38:35.678
Were you really expecting for me
to be all happy and glowy?

38:35.760 --> 38:36.750
No. No.

38:36.840 --> 38:38.239
I just... I thought...

38:38.320 --> 38:40.789
I thought we would talk
a little bit more.

38:40.920 --> 38:42.149
What is there to say?

38:42.240 --> 38:44.151
I don't feel anything
for this baby.

38:44.240 --> 38:46.231
It's hard to have love
for something

38:46.320 --> 38:48.072
that's camping out
on your bladder.

38:48.160 --> 38:50.993
I remember watching my ass
turn into my Aunt Louise's.

38:51.080 --> 38:53.356
It was not a good look.

38:53.440 --> 38:57.320
But... I also remember having
these really vivid dreams.

38:57.400 --> 38:59.835
None of this
is what dreams are made of.

38:59.920 --> 39:01.991
It was just a mistake.

39:02.080 --> 39:04.117
So if you're trying to prove
something by taking that on,

39:04.200 --> 39:05.713
<i>God bless.</i>

39:05.800 --> 39:08.440
I am trying to prove something.

39:10.000 --> 39:13.516
L-I know that's crazy, but I...
he was always...

39:15.480 --> 39:19.075
Look, the nurse, when I was
checking out of the hospital,

39:19.160 --> 39:21.117
handed me George
all wrapped up in a blanket

39:21.200 --> 39:23.874
and said, "You have
a difficult child. Good luck."

39:23.960 --> 39:25.155
And she was right.

39:25.240 --> 39:27.038
I should have done more,
you know?

39:27.120 --> 39:29.111
I was young
and I was in a bad marriage,

39:29.200 --> 39:32.318
and you just realize stuff
as time goes on.

39:32.400 --> 39:34.835
So...

39:34.920 --> 39:38.515
Look. He's my kid.

39:38.600 --> 39:40.671
He's my responsibility, even now.

39:40.760 --> 39:44.390
And I love him.
And I will love that baby.

39:44.480 --> 39:46.357
And I'm gonna do this right,
Ms. Diaz.

39:46.440 --> 39:47.874
I am committed.

39:47.960 --> 39:50.076
All yours.

39:50.200 --> 39:51.634
Are we done here?

39:51.720 --> 39:53.711
Oh, my God.
You don't even know me.

39:53.800 --> 39:56.189
I mean, I-l could be
some kind of ax murderer

39:56.280 --> 39:57.600
who wants to make coats

39:57.680 --> 40:00.513
out of the skins of babies
or something.

40:00.600 --> 40:03.638
I watch... I watch
a lot of "true crime" TV.

40:03.720 --> 40:06.394
You want the baby. I said yes.

40:06.480 --> 40:08.278
Why do you keep on pushing me?

40:08.400 --> 40:10.596
Because I'm afraid
you'll change your mind.

40:10.720 --> 40:13.314
I'm afraid that you'll snap out
of this depression

40:13.400 --> 40:15.038
and wonder,
"what was I thinking?"

40:15.120 --> 40:16.519
You got a paper?

40:16.640 --> 40:18.631
I'll sign it over right now.

40:18.720 --> 40:22.475
You'll get your do-over baby,
and I'll have a chance

40:22.560 --> 40:26.235
to start a life where I just
got to worry about me.

40:26.360 --> 40:28.670
You can't sign the paper
until you've had the baby.

40:28.760 --> 40:31.513
Oh, I get it now.

40:33.280 --> 40:36.238
Is there somebody in here
that you could talk to?

40:36.320 --> 40:38.675
You know,
a professional or something?

40:40.080 --> 40:41.753
My counselor's an old white man

40:41.840 --> 40:44.912
who tries to connect
by saying "hola" in the hallway.

40:46.640 --> 40:49.678
And lucky for you,
my mom is all up for the deal.

40:49.800 --> 40:51.279
I talk to her sometimes.

40:51.360 --> 40:53.954
When she's not being
a total bitch.

40:55.840 --> 40:58.912
Go, team.

40:59.000 --> 41:02.231
Well, I'm gonna come back
and visit you again really soon,

41:02.320 --> 41:03.754
and we'll talk some more.

41:11.480 --> 41:13.790
It was very nice to meet you, Dayanara.

41:18.600 --> 41:19.954
Bye.

41:24.280 --> 41:26.271
Watch. Check it out. See?

41:26.360 --> 41:29.591
Oh, yeah!
Mama's got a brand-new bag!

41:29.680 --> 41:32.593
Yeah!

41:32.680 --> 41:35.957
'Course fucking Chapman got it.

41:36.040 --> 41:38.111
Oh! Fuck yeah! That's me.

41:38.200 --> 41:40.237
<i>Queen of the new job</i>

41:40.320 --> 41:42.880
Whoo! Yes!

41:42.960 --> 41:45.190
Ain't nobody's maid no more!

41:48.880 --> 41:50.473
No! Quit that.

41:50.560 --> 41:52.995
How do you know
that job's any good anyhow?

41:53.080 --> 41:55.196
Besides,
I thought you liked cleaning.

41:55.280 --> 41:57.237
No, but I failed, T.

41:57.320 --> 41:58.310
I should have answered
the question

41:58.400 --> 42:00.232
in the reverse of how I felt.

42:00.320 --> 42:02.152
The opposite of me is better.

42:02.240 --> 42:05.278
The opposite of you is... boring.

42:05.360 --> 42:10.036
You're obviously too...
creative for that job.

42:12.200 --> 42:15.431
You bitches get in? Hm?

42:15.520 --> 42:17.397
No.

42:17.520 --> 42:19.079
Oh, well, then we promise
not to throw

42:19.160 --> 42:22.630
our new, high-paying jobs
in your face too much.

42:24.960 --> 42:26.712
That's just business, right?

42:26.800 --> 42:28.632
You know, some cutthroat shit.

42:28.720 --> 42:30.518
Oh, anywayÂ»-

42:30.600 --> 42:33.160
So, you think I need
a fresh, new first-day 'do?

42:33.240 --> 42:37.473
Yeah! Hook it up, look hot.
Curls.

42:39.480 --> 42:41.232
Maybe some little spirals,
some curls, you know.

42:45.560 --> 42:47.551
Hey... Gonzales.

42:48.840 --> 42:50.035
Congrats.

42:50.120 --> 42:51.758
I saw you got in.

42:51.880 --> 42:55.191
Seriously?
Holy shit.

42:55.280 --> 42:58.910
You know, I was psyching myself
out the whole time.

42:59.000 --> 43:02.470
But I guess my smarts
must have kicked in anyhow.

43:02.600 --> 43:04.238
So cool. How 'bout you?

43:04.320 --> 43:08.951
Nah. Still stuck in the toilet,
so to speak.

43:09.040 --> 43:11.270
Calgon, take me away!

43:11.400 --> 43:12.834
I'm sorry about that.

43:12.920 --> 43:14.752
But, you know,
I'm gonna tell everybody I know

43:14.840 --> 43:16.956
to try to pee real neat
from now on, okay?

43:17.040 --> 43:18.599
Make your life a little easier.

43:20.000 --> 43:21.274
Thanks for that.

43:23.800 --> 43:25.632
Come on. Come on.

43:25.720 --> 43:28.155
Get out the way.
Hurry up.

43:35.920 --> 43:37.877
Look how close our bunks are.

43:39.320 --> 43:42.073
Now we can share
each other's clothes.

43:42.160 --> 43:43.355
They're announcing
who got the new job assignment.

43:43.440 --> 43:44.635
You want to go see?

43:44.720 --> 43:46.996
Yeah. Okay.

43:47.080 --> 43:51.756
You still on the lookout
for shanking belly dancers?

43:51.840 --> 43:55.231
To quote Philip K. Dick,
"It's strange how paranoia

43:55.360 --> 43:57.431
can link up with reality
now and then."

43:57.520 --> 44:03.311
You know, Kubra probably
loves me since I lied for him.

44:03.400 --> 44:05.914
Maybe I'm his gal
on the inside.

44:06.000 --> 44:07.513
Ha ha.

44:07.640 --> 44:10.075
You know what I would use
for my shank?

44:11.560 --> 44:13.631
- Your very own toothbrush.
- Fuck off.

44:16.680 --> 44:19.752
Seriously, did he reach out
to you after the trial?

44:19.840 --> 44:22.070
No. I'm just playing-

44:22.160 --> 44:23.480
Or am I?

44:23.560 --> 44:25.198
Quit it, Piper.
You're freaking me out.

44:25.280 --> 44:26.509
Be straight.

44:26.680 --> 44:28.637
Did you talk to him?

44:28.720 --> 44:30.631
You have to tell me.

44:30.720 --> 44:33.553
Wait... like,
if you were a drug dealer,

44:33.680 --> 44:35.876
hypothetically, and I was a narc

44:35.960 --> 44:38.520
and you were asking me
if I was a cop?

44:38.600 --> 44:40.079
"21 jump street"-style?

44:40.160 --> 44:41.958
Yeah, exactly like that.

44:42.040 --> 44:47.956
I have not been hired
to kill you, Alex.

44:49.440 --> 44:51.078
Or psychologically torture me?

44:51.160 --> 44:54.232
Well... not by Kubra's command.

44:54.320 --> 44:56.994
Will you stop
making light of this?

44:57.080 --> 44:59.959
There is a very real possibility

45:00.040 --> 45:01.997
that he would send someone
for me.

45:02.080 --> 45:04.230
Okay, you're right.
No, I'm...

45:05.280 --> 45:07.237
I'm done.

45:07.320 --> 45:09.630
Unless, of course,
I'm hiding a weapon in my bra.

45:09.720 --> 45:11.916
I think you need to check.

45:42.520 --> 45:45.751
Everything boils down
to control with you!

45:45.840 --> 45:49.231
All I'm saying is, if you took
Howard Street rather than Maple,

45:49.320 --> 45:51.675
we would save three minutes
on the drive.

45:51.760 --> 45:53.876
It's not controlling...
it's efficient.

45:53.960 --> 45:55.359
It's three minutes.

45:55.480 --> 45:58.233
And I enjoy the houses on Maple.
They're quaint.

45:58.320 --> 46:01.790
Along with the, uh, red-painted
door and the tire swing.

46:01.880 --> 46:04.235
Makes me think
maybe the world's a nice place.

46:04.320 --> 46:06.914
I'll take that thought
over three minutes any day.

46:08.880 --> 46:10.632
My hours got cut.

46:10.760 --> 46:13.434
See? I was right. I knew it.

46:13.520 --> 46:14.919
Smoke and mirrors.

46:15.040 --> 46:16.678
Sorry, Ford.

46:16.760 --> 46:19.229
No, mine too... in half.

46:22.640 --> 46:25.234
Sons of bitches.

46:25.320 --> 46:28.438
You think this is just us?
Have we been slacking?

46:28.520 --> 46:30.716
You let an inmate steal a van,
kill another inmate with it.

46:30.800 --> 46:31.949
I mean, that's pretty egregious.

46:32.040 --> 46:33.360
Suck it, O'neill.

46:33.440 --> 46:34.919
I was found to be
not at fault for that.

46:35.000 --> 46:38.038
No, this is them...
corporate greed mongers.

46:38.120 --> 46:39.997
So, who's covering
the hours we're losing?

46:40.080 --> 46:44.074
More mongers.
They multiply like gremlins.

46:44.160 --> 46:47.471
You still think
the world's a nice place?

46:49.800 --> 46:51.518
Yes!

46:53.800 --> 46:57.191
Hey, what you think?
Does this say "swag"?

46:58.440 --> 47:00.238
Great job
not rubbing it in our faces.

47:00.320 --> 47:03.153
Hey, I didn't say that. Watson did.

47:03.240 --> 47:06.278
Yo, did you talk
to your girl, Poussey?

47:06.360 --> 47:08.078
She didn't take the test.

47:08.160 --> 47:09.309
Nah!

47:09.400 --> 47:11.038
She too busy fighting off

47:11.120 --> 47:13.873
some imaginary
drink-thievin' racquirrel

47:13.960 --> 47:15.598
to worry about this shit.

47:15.680 --> 47:18.593
Outside pissing in circles,
making traps.

47:18.680 --> 47:20.353
You need to come clean.

47:20.480 --> 47:24.599
Tell her you took her shit
'fore she really get cracked.

47:24.680 --> 47:26.353
Are her traps humane?

47:26.440 --> 47:29.193
Cartoon-style with a stick and a box.

47:29.280 --> 47:33.353
Look, I'd rather see her
running around like a fool

47:33.440 --> 47:35.511
than sleeping and drinking
all damn day.

47:36.240 --> 47:37.594
At least she's up and moving.

47:37.680 --> 47:42.277
Up and moving and giving Looney Tunes
here a run for her money.

47:42.360 --> 47:44.317
Well, she's got a goal now.

47:44.400 --> 47:46.277
I'll tell her... eventually.

47:46.360 --> 47:47.873
But... don't rush.

47:47.960 --> 47:49.519
You know, once you know
Santa Claus isn't real,

47:49.600 --> 47:51.671
it's all... downhill from there.

47:51.760 --> 47:53.671
Okay, what the hell's
Santa Claus got to do with this?

47:53.760 --> 47:55.797
It's good to have
something to believe in.

47:55.880 --> 47:58.633
Giant drunky squirrel, Santa.

47:58.720 --> 48:02.395
It's like the test said...
ideas are better than reality.

48:02.480 --> 48:04.278
And you agree with that?

48:05.800 --> 48:07.074
Well, no wonder
you didn't get the job.

48:07.160 --> 48:09.356
The reality
they was talking about

48:09.440 --> 48:11.795
was working your ass off
for the man.

48:14.400 --> 48:17.791
Your answer basically
told the man to fuck off.

48:17.880 --> 48:19.632
I didn't mean that.

48:19.720 --> 48:22.678
Wait, so, do you think I should
talk to somebody and say...

48:22.760 --> 48:24.273
...you know, explain myself.

48:24.360 --> 48:26.920
See, I think
that ship has sailed, my dear.

48:27.000 --> 48:30.311
Time to go sweep up
some pube hives.

48:30.400 --> 48:33.518
I like to think of them
more like pube nests.

48:33.600 --> 48:36.035
Everybody's got
fucking opinions!

48:36.120 --> 48:39.351
Well, consolation Snickers on me
later, scrubs.

48:39.440 --> 48:40.794
Puff out.

48:43.240 --> 48:44.878
No.

48:44.960 --> 48:48.032
Something is missing in my life.

48:48.120 --> 48:54.355
No matter how much reading
and gardening I do, my mind drifts.

48:54.440 --> 48:55.953
I have this need.

48:56.040 --> 48:57.474
Okay.

48:57.560 --> 49:00.598
An overwhelming need... a drive.

49:01.560 --> 49:03.039
A hunger.

49:03.960 --> 49:05.109
A hunger?

49:05.200 --> 49:06.918
Yes.

49:07.000 --> 49:09.469
I am missing the heat, you know?

49:09.560 --> 49:12.791
That flush in my face
that only comes from real...

49:12.880 --> 49:14.359
Passion.

49:16.640 --> 49:17.835
Oh, yeah.

49:17.960 --> 49:19.439
I understand.

49:19.560 --> 49:22.120
Give me something
to be consumed with, Healy.

49:22.200 --> 49:24.760
Sure, it leaves me
with blisters and burns

49:24.840 --> 49:28.595
and an aching back,
but it's work... real work.

49:28.680 --> 49:30.591
And I yearn for it.

49:30.680 --> 49:34.878
A-are you talking about
the kitchen?

49:36.760 --> 49:39.832
It is a proven fact
that people in retirement

49:39.960 --> 49:42.349
are more likely
to get Alzheimer's.

49:42.440 --> 49:44.272
I don't want to become Jimmy,

49:44.360 --> 49:46.431
walking around
with my underwear on my head.

49:46.520 --> 49:49.319
I need purpose and stimulation.

49:49.400 --> 49:53.473
Well, Mendoza's doing a fine job
in the kitchen.

49:53.560 --> 49:56.916
We have no reason
to replace her.

49:57.000 --> 49:59.071
So you'll have to...

49:59.160 --> 50:02.312
...you'll have to look
somewhere else for your s...

50:03.920 --> 50:07.197
You'll have to find your purpose
somewhere else.

50:07.280 --> 50:11.592
I'm sure with this new regime,
there will be changes.

50:11.680 --> 50:14.513
Maybe you can
slip this one through, as well.

50:14.600 --> 50:17.114
Please. Comrade to comrade.

50:17.240 --> 50:22.474
Look, Red...
this is protocol.

50:22.560 --> 50:25.439
You got busted for those drugs.

50:25.520 --> 50:28.399
There's no way
Caputo's signing off on this.

50:29.800 --> 50:31.154
You didn't get to where you are

50:31.240 --> 50:33.675
without knowing
how to work the system.

50:34.480 --> 50:36.278
I respect the system.

50:36.360 --> 50:38.920
Don't you also respect me?

50:40.560 --> 50:42.631
Jesus, Red.

50:44.280 --> 50:46.271
I thought you were different.

50:50.720 --> 50:54.076
I bet a bunch of those girls
didn't answer the questions honestly.

50:54.160 --> 50:55.719
I ain't 100 percent sure I did.

50:56.680 --> 50:58.717
Yeah, it was confusing.

50:58.800 --> 51:01.394
I had to take a test like that
one time,

51:01.480 --> 51:03.198
when I applied to be an RA.

51:03.280 --> 51:04.839
What's an RA?

51:04.920 --> 51:08.470
A resident advisor,
like, for my dorm in college.

51:08.560 --> 51:11.439
I didn't get that one, either.

51:11.520 --> 51:13.830
We must be too emotional.

51:13.920 --> 51:16.560
And that's bad?

51:16.640 --> 51:19.712
I mean, it doesn't make
for a good employee.

51:19.800 --> 51:22.519
Like, I read a horrible article
this morning

51:22.640 --> 51:25.871
about this woman getting stoned
in Iran for adultery,

51:25.960 --> 51:27.712
and it seriously made me
so upset

51:27.800 --> 51:30.997
that I've folded this laundry
like four times already.

51:32.400 --> 51:35.119
Emotional equals unproductive,
lguess.

51:36.680 --> 51:37.829
I like getting stoned.

51:37.920 --> 51:39.593
Who doesn't?

51:39.680 --> 51:42.798
Yeah.

51:42.880 --> 51:44.757
Getting stoned...

51:44.840 --> 51:46.239
It's so fun.

51:51.200 --> 51:52.793
So...

51:54.840 --> 51:56.274
Walmart.

51:58.200 --> 51:59.520
How 'bout Walmart?

51:59.600 --> 52:02.752
It's so big. I went there once.

52:02.840 --> 52:06.720
I noticed that there was
a lot of cheap shit in there.

52:06.800 --> 52:10.555
Like, just everything
you could ever want.

52:10.640 --> 52:12.233
Someone check the hot dogs
out there.

52:12.320 --> 52:14.755
- I think they're running low.
- I just refilled them.

52:14.840 --> 52:17.434
Well, stay on them.
That no-carb trend is back.

52:17.520 --> 52:20.592
I'm up to my ears in buns.

52:20.680 --> 52:23.991
Oh. Look who decided to grace us
with her presence.

52:24.160 --> 52:26.913
Throw an apron on.
We'll talk punishment later.

52:27.000 --> 52:29.150
I got the job.

52:29.240 --> 52:31.754
I'm supposed to start
in a few minutes.

52:31.840 --> 52:33.478
I just wanted to come
let you know.

52:33.560 --> 52:36.951
Oh. How considerate of you.

52:37.040 --> 52:38.474
To show your front

52:38.560 --> 52:40.756
while you're turning your back
on your family.

52:42.240 --> 52:44.072
I earned it, Gloria.
You should be proud of me.

52:44.160 --> 52:45.559
Because of that test?

52:45.680 --> 52:47.000
I heard some of the questions
on that test.

52:47.080 --> 52:48.639
It's not even about anything.

52:48.720 --> 52:50.870
They were obviously about
something, and I got them right.

52:50.960 --> 52:54.316
Blanca took it, too,
and she didn't get picked.

52:57.080 --> 52:59.594
Oh, so now you're better
than us.

52:59.680 --> 53:01.159
What, you're chosen?

53:03.000 --> 53:07.233
Oh, watch out, Norma. Flaca is
moving in on your territory.

53:08.760 --> 53:10.319
That's right. I am better.

53:10.400 --> 53:12.198
Better than all you bitches.

53:12.280 --> 53:14.157
Maybe I got C's in high school

53:14.240 --> 53:16.470
because my personality
is too complex

53:16.560 --> 53:17.994
for mainstream academics.

53:18.080 --> 53:20.196
Some people are born
for greatness.

53:20.280 --> 53:24.319
How nice that prison could help
you realize your full potential.

53:24.400 --> 53:25.435
Fuck you!

53:38.880 --> 53:40.314
<i>Your budget is $800,000.</i>

53:49.440 --> 53:51.113
<i>Many private islands
in the Keys</i>

53:51.240 --> 53:54.949
<i>sell for over $10 million,
so finding...</i>

54:00.040 --> 54:02.759
- Marisol Gonzales?
- Yes.

54:02.840 --> 54:04.831
Can we talk to you for a minute?

54:11.680 --> 54:14.399
- You're under arrest.
- What are you talking about?

54:15.640 --> 54:17.472
Jason Anders
is in critical condition.

54:17.560 --> 54:19.039
You better hope he lives.

54:19.120 --> 54:21.714
I do. He's a nice kid.
But that's not my fault.

54:21.800 --> 54:23.359
You sold him
a controlled substance.

54:23.440 --> 54:25.033
I did not.

54:25.120 --> 54:27.191
I sold him a piece of paper.

54:27.280 --> 54:28.839
That crazy was all him.

54:28.920 --> 54:30.149
Listen to me.

54:30.280 --> 54:31.714
I sold him plain paper

54:31.800 --> 54:34.314
with nothing
but water and print on it.

54:34.400 --> 54:35.799
It was all fake.

54:35.880 --> 54:37.632
Yeah, well, his reaction to it
was very real.

54:37.720 --> 54:39.518
- And it's a crime regardless.
- No.

54:44.600 --> 54:45.999
Ma'am, your daughter
is under arrest

54:46.080 --> 54:47.354
for fraud and endangerment.

54:47.440 --> 54:48.589
That's all we know.

54:48.720 --> 54:50.233
No. No, this is not real.

54:50.320 --> 54:51.754
- Let's go. Officer.
- No, this can't be real.

54:51.840 --> 54:54.559
- I didn't do nothing! No! No!
- Officer.

54:54.640 --> 54:56.153
It was paper!

54:56.280 --> 54:57.759
Ma'am, we can talk about it
down at the precinct.

54:59.280 --> 55:00.759
Hey, I-l understand

55:00.840 --> 55:03.070
the new job assignments
were announced, and...

55:03.160 --> 55:04.992
- Oh, yeah. Yeah.
- ...l read over that test.

55:05.080 --> 55:07.071
Where did... where did you
come up with that?

55:07.160 --> 55:09.754
Oh, I just, uh,
pulled that off the internet.

55:09.840 --> 55:12.116
Some kind of
new assessment technique?

55:12.200 --> 55:14.430
It was like
a personality quiz or something.

55:14.520 --> 55:16.636
I don't even know.
We didn't even read them.

55:16.720 --> 55:19.712
Jones just pulled 40
out of a pile randomly,

55:19.800 --> 55:21.711
and those were the winners.

55:23.200 --> 55:27.433
That's your system?
Random selection?

55:27.520 --> 55:30.717
My system is to make the ladies
think that there is a system.

55:30.800 --> 55:34.794
So they don't hate us
for not getting the job.

55:34.880 --> 55:37.998
They're mad at themselves
for not having what it takes.

55:38.080 --> 55:42.313
But you reviewed the files of
the women you selected, right?

55:42.440 --> 55:46.673
I mean, made sure there were
no risks in that job placement?

55:46.760 --> 55:50.071
We'll have COs on post.

55:50.200 --> 55:53.670
We've had a lot of success
with this model.

55:53.760 --> 55:57.276
I have to tell you
that our model

55:57.360 --> 55:59.556
for not allowing
violent criminals

55:59.640 --> 56:02.553
to work with sharp tools
or arsonists in the kitchen

56:02.640 --> 56:04.597
hasn't been so bad, either.

56:04.680 --> 56:06.079
You're right.

56:06.160 --> 56:08.879
Yeah, no, I totally get it.
You're right.

56:08.960 --> 56:11.918
I think what we'll do
is we'll send you the list,

56:12.000 --> 56:12.990
and then
if there are any red flags,

56:13.080 --> 56:14.354
you can send those back to us,

56:14.440 --> 56:17.193
and... and we'll adjust
accordingly.

56:18.880 --> 56:20.314
Good thinking, Caputo.

56:20.400 --> 56:21.595
Thanks a lot.

56:21.680 --> 56:24.274
I feel really lucky you're here.

56:25.840 --> 56:27.956
- Great.
- Great.

56:28.040 --> 56:29.553
Great.

56:29.640 --> 56:33.952
Congratulations on landing
this coveted new job.

56:34.040 --> 56:36.839
This is an opportunity
for all of you

56:36.920 --> 56:39.196
to learn a very in-demand trade.

56:39.280 --> 56:41.794
And we hope
that you will take it

56:41.880 --> 56:45.999
<i>as</i> seriously as we did
when selecting you.

56:46.080 --> 56:49.869
Ladies, welcome to Whispers.

56:56.840 --> 56:58.558
Cool!

57:13.080 --> 57:15.435
We makin' panties?
