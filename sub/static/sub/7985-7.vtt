HOLLY: <i>Ever since</i>
<i>the minis showed up,</i>

00:05.906 --> 00:07.774
Abby has been
all over the place.

00:07.774 --> 00:09.109
(crying):
I am hysterical.

00:09.109 --> 00:11.512
<i>I have a huge legal issue</i>
<i>going on.</i>

00:11.512 --> 00:12.813
I'm finished.

00:12.813 --> 00:14.481
We received an e‐mail

00:14.481 --> 00:15.816
that she's resigning.

00:15.816 --> 00:16.550
What?

00:16.550 --> 00:17.818
Get out of here!

00:17.818 --> 00:19.086
HOLLY: <i>I think</i>
<i>if Debbie Allen offered,</i>

00:19.086 --> 00:20.854
<i>and we don't have</i>
<i>a place next week,</i>

00:20.854 --> 00:22.789
we could rehearse at her studio.

00:22.789 --> 00:24.358
ABBY LEE: <i>Brynn did</i>
<i>an outstanding job.</i>

00:24.358 --> 00:26.627
<i>She led the group to victory,</i>
<i>and I'm gonna</i>

00:26.627 --> 00:27.928
keep her around.

00:27.928 --> 00:29.563
You're pathetic!
Karma's a bitch.

00:29.563 --> 00:31.164
What goes around
comes around.

00:31.164 --> 00:32.199
You're absolutely right.

ABBY LEE:

This show has to go on.

00:36.803 --> 00:37.771
Why?

00:37.771 --> 00:39.339
We just need to find
another place.

00:39.339 --> 00:40.574
Leave. Go.

00:40.574 --> 00:42.009
JESSALYNN:
You didn't bring costumes!

00:42.009 --> 00:43.010
You don't do your job!

00:43.944 --> 00:45.479
She doesn't want us here.

00:45.479 --> 00:47.714
Did she say that?
She did.

00:47.714 --> 00:50.150
JESSALYNN:
<i>Let's go to Debbie Allen.</i>

00:50.150 --> 00:51.418
I don't feel the joy.

00:51.418 --> 00:52.920
ASHLEE:
<i>Kalani's not as good</i>

00:52.920 --> 00:54.288
as she used to be.

00:54.288 --> 00:55.289
Go (bleep) yourself.

00:55.289 --> 00:56.823
You don't want to be here,
just go home!

00:56.823 --> 00:58.025
This is why she's a pathetic

00:58.025 --> 01:00.093
piece of (bleep).

MELISSA:
<i>Hi, Abb.</i>

01:16.877 --> 01:19.446
I love that you have cute boys
working for you, always.

01:19.446 --> 01:20.981
JILL: Oh, I love how
you do that to your hair.

01:20.981 --> 01:22.049
It looks like rollers,
but not,

01:22.049 --> 01:23.684
so when you take it out,
it's all...

01:23.684 --> 01:25.152
Your color is great.

01:25.152 --> 01:26.553

Oh, God.

01:42.936 --> 01:45.372
Listen...
There's ongoing incident

01:45.372 --> 01:47.441
that needs to be addressed.

01:47.441 --> 01:49.009
I‐I know.

01:49.009 --> 01:50.577
It has nothing to do
with the routine.

01:50.577 --> 01:52.879
They have to dance,
because...

01:52.879 --> 01:54.548
the show has to go on. I mean...

01:54.548 --> 01:55.749
Why?

01:55.749 --> 01:57.985
JILL:
<i>I know Abby is overextended.</i>

01:57.985 --> 02:00.020
<i>She's got a ton going on.</i>

02:00.020 --> 02:04.491
<i>She's dealing with legal issues</i>
<i>that could land her in jail,</i>

02:04.491 --> 02:06.560
but this is not fair
to our kids.

02:06.560 --> 02:08.395
<i>Which Abby is gonna show up?</i>

02:08.395 --> 02:10.364
Is she gonna be happy
and want to teach?

02:10.364 --> 02:12.466
Sauté with a turn in.

02:12.466 --> 02:13.700
Got that?

02:15.535 --> 02:16.770
(laughs)

02:16.770 --> 02:19.339
Is she gonna be mad
and sit in her bedroom?

02:19.339 --> 02:21.274
Get out of here!

02:21.274 --> 02:22.776
Which Abby is gonna show up?

02:22.776 --> 02:25.445
We're here to‐to see how...

02:25.445 --> 02:27.114
see through
what we've started.

02:27.114 --> 02:28.715
You can't go out on the bottom.

02:28.715 --> 02:30.250
You have to go out on top.

02:30.250 --> 02:32.452
All right, let me ask you this.

02:32.452 --> 02:35.656
Can you find a way, Jill,
in that little brain of yours,

02:35.656 --> 02:38.859
can you figure
out a way to

02:38.859 --> 02:42.663
completely discourse
the federal government's

02:42.663 --> 02:45.365
perception of me

02:45.365 --> 02:47.634
holding $170,000.

02:47.634 --> 02:49.236
I don't know.
How can you fix that?

02:49.236 --> 02:51.738
'Cause that's what needs fixed.

02:51.738 --> 02:53.473
These mothers have no clue.

02:53.473 --> 02:55.475
I was not put on this Earth

02:55.475 --> 02:59.246
<i>to be at their beck and call</i>
<i>for their daughters.</i>

02:59.246 --> 03:01.548
I have problems
of my own to deal with.

03:01.548 --> 03:04.251
And sometimes,
they have to take priority.

03:04.251 --> 03:05.952
So, what's the problem?

03:05.952 --> 03:08.555
The problem is
that there's no respect‐‐

03:08.555 --> 03:09.690
none‐‐

03:09.690 --> 03:12.059
for the damage done...

03:12.059 --> 03:13.593
Okay, but we did not do that.

03:13.593 --> 03:14.961
...financially.

03:14.961 --> 03:16.830
The girls did not do that.

03:16.830 --> 03:18.131
And that's,
like, what's...

03:18.131 --> 03:20.167
taking, like,
the brunt of it right now.

03:20.167 --> 03:21.768
Let's go do the dance.

03:21.768 --> 03:23.170
Let's go do pyramid. Who cares?

03:23.170 --> 03:28.141
I have a right in this country
not to work for you.

03:30.444 --> 03:32.679
You know what, do you want
to go to Debbie Allen's studio?

03:32.679 --> 03:33.847
That's the other option.

03:36.583 --> 03:38.719
That's fine with you?
JESSALYNN: No.

03:38.719 --> 03:41.088
That's not gonna make you happy.

03:41.088 --> 03:42.723
Leave. Go.

03:42.723 --> 03:44.825
HOLLY:
So, if you don't want us here,

03:44.825 --> 03:46.893
we don't need to be.
We just need to find
another place.

03:48.895 --> 03:50.530
We trying, Abby.

03:50.530 --> 03:52.599
We are, we are ALDC
right here.

03:52.599 --> 03:53.734
We are here.

03:53.734 --> 03:55.602
<i>But you keep</i>
<i>pushing everyone away.</i>

03:55.602 --> 03:57.170
JILL: <i>We're here,</i>
<i>and we're here for you.</i>

03:57.170 --> 03:59.072
Go!

03:59.072 --> 04:00.674
These kids
love the studio.

04:00.674 --> 04:02.576
Can I tell you something?
Okay, I'm gone.

04:02.576 --> 04:04.778
<i>To hear Abby say</i>
<i>we should leave</i>

04:04.778 --> 04:06.880
<i>is a slap in the face.</i>

04:06.880 --> 04:08.982
We don't have to take
what Abby's giving us.

04:08.982 --> 04:11.785
<i>That's not the dance teacher</i>
<i>I signed up for.</i>

04:11.785 --> 04:13.186
JILL:
Honestly, Abby,

04:13.186 --> 04:14.421
we want to be here.

04:14.421 --> 04:15.889
I know those moms
want to be here.

04:15.889 --> 04:17.958
Abby, I think
you should come out

04:17.958 --> 04:19.626
and be with your kids.

04:21.995 --> 04:23.997
So, we'll give you
a minute.

04:26.233 --> 04:28.368
And then we'll see you
in a little bit.

04:30.070 --> 04:31.905
I know. It's hard
to see you like this.

04:31.905 --> 04:33.440
You shouldn't have
to be like this.

04:33.440 --> 04:34.441
You know we love you, Abb.

04:34.441 --> 04:35.642
And you're strong.
You know?

04:35.642 --> 04:36.877
Then walk away.

04:36.877 --> 04:38.145
You'll get
through everything.

04:38.145 --> 04:39.246
Then walk away.

04:40.847 --> 04:42.382
JILL: <i>Abby's been</i>
<i>with all of our girls</i>

04:42.382 --> 04:43.583
<i>since they were minis.</i>

04:43.583 --> 04:45.819
<i>I know, deep down in her heart,</i>

04:45.819 --> 04:47.487
she really
doesn't want them to leave.

04:47.487 --> 04:51.324
<i>I'm hoping that if we give Abby</i>
<i>some time to collect herself,</i>

04:51.324 --> 04:53.660
she will want to come out
and teach our kids.

04:55.662 --> 04:57.597
Is‐is she dressed or...?

04:57.597 --> 04:58.832
JESSALYNN: You know
what you looked like

04:58.832 --> 05:00.767
at about...
7:10 this morning?

05:00.767 --> 05:03.403
That's what she looks like
right now.

05:03.403 --> 05:05.172
Just not ready for the day.

05:08.575 --> 05:10.577
(dramatic music playing)

05:10.577 --> 05:12.245
JILL:
<i>Did you just teach them this?</i>

05:12.245 --> 05:13.280
GIANNA:
<i>Yeah.</i>

05:13.280 --> 05:15.015
It's really good.

05:15.015 --> 05:16.216
JILL: <i>These kids</i>
<i>are freaking amazing.</i>

05:16.216 --> 05:17.551
GIANNA:
<i>The theme is steampunk.</i>

05:17.551 --> 05:19.052
<i>Like, industrial,</i>

05:19.052 --> 05:20.453
mechanical,

05:20.453 --> 05:21.555
grungy.

05:21.555 --> 05:23.557
JILL:
<i>Our group dance this week</i>

05:23.557 --> 05:25.892
is entitled
"Well‐Oiled Machine."

05:25.892 --> 05:28.829
<i>And thank God Abby</i>
<i>has already given Gianna</i>

05:28.829 --> 05:30.864
direction and choreography

05:30.864 --> 05:34.501
<i>so that she can teach the girls</i>
<i>until Abby decides to come out</i>

05:34.501 --> 05:35.836
<i>and be with her team.</i>

05:35.836 --> 05:37.671
So where are we going
this weekend?

05:37.671 --> 05:39.039
GIANNA:
We're going to Phoenix.

05:39.039 --> 05:40.674
JESSALYNN: <i>I'm worried</i>
<i>about going to Phoenix.</i>

05:40.674 --> 05:42.576
<i>There's a lot</i>
<i>of good dancers here.</i>

05:42.576 --> 05:44.010
There's a lot of good studios.

05:44.010 --> 05:45.946
And let's face it,

05:45.946 --> 05:47.948
<i>with Abby and deciding</i>

05:47.948 --> 05:50.750
<i>whether she wants to teach</i>
<i>or doesn't want to teach,</i>

05:50.750 --> 05:52.652
<i>we're not off to</i>
<i>the greatest start this year.</i>

05:52.652 --> 05:55.322
<i>Like, this could be our</i>
<i>first really big competition,</i>

05:55.322 --> 05:56.656
<i>and we need a win.</i>

05:56.656 --> 05:58.592
JILL:
G, who has sol...

05:58.592 --> 06:01.127
Do you know the... who has what?

06:01.127 --> 06:02.128
It's Brynn

06:02.128 --> 06:03.396
<i>and Kalani, first of all,</i>

06:03.396 --> 06:04.831
<i>And then it was</i>
<i>supposed to be Maddie,</i>

06:04.831 --> 06:06.766
because she was supposed
to be back this week,

06:06.766 --> 06:08.168
but because she's
not back in time,

06:08.168 --> 06:10.203
we'd rather her be
in the group.

06:10.203 --> 06:11.805
Maddie's supposed
to be here right now,

06:11.805 --> 06:13.473
but she's filming
her final scene for the movie.

06:13.473 --> 06:16.209
<i>So she's gonna meet us</i>
<i>in Phoenix</i>

06:16.209 --> 06:17.711
<i>to learn the group dance</i>

06:17.711 --> 06:20.480
<i>and be back on the team</i>
<i>for the rest of the season.</i>

06:20.480 --> 06:21.514
<i>We're gonna see Kira</i>

06:21.514 --> 06:23.016
this weekend.
JILL:
Good.

06:23.016 --> 06:24.851
Now, does she know
Ashlee's still with us?

06:24.851 --> 06:26.052
Mm‐hmm.

06:26.052 --> 06:28.822
JILL: Weren't there
some nasty texts being shot

06:28.822 --> 06:30.457
back and forth from you two?
ASHLEE: Not from me.

06:30.457 --> 06:31.758
All from her.

06:31.758 --> 06:32.726
What's she pissed about?

06:32.726 --> 06:33.927
Somebody told her that

06:33.927 --> 06:36.029
I was talking (bleep)
about her all day.

06:36.029 --> 06:38.999
And then she sent me
all those horrible texts.

06:38.999 --> 06:40.934
Kira and I are both
from Phoenix.

06:40.934 --> 06:42.135
Our kids grew up

06:42.135 --> 06:44.371
<i>dancing at the same studio.</i>

06:44.371 --> 06:46.606
<i>I get that Kira has</i>
<i>a baby at home,</i>

06:46.606 --> 06:48.808
<i>but she wasn't even committed</i>
<i>before she had a baby,</i>

06:48.808 --> 06:51.211
<i>and I know she's threatened</i>
<i>by me being here.</i>

06:51.211 --> 06:52.279
<i>Because Kira knows</i>

06:52.279 --> 06:54.381
that I know so much about her.

06:54.381 --> 06:56.549
JILL:
I guess my question is:

06:56.549 --> 06:58.785
when we get to Phoenix
and Kira shows up,

06:58.785 --> 07:00.053
what's gonna happen
with you two?

07:00.053 --> 07:01.154
I don't know.

07:01.154 --> 07:02.188
Oh, God.

07:02.188 --> 07:03.256
I don't know.

07:03.256 --> 07:05.292
JILL:
<i>I know Ashlee and Kira</i>

07:05.292 --> 07:07.260
have a lot of drama
between the two of them.

07:07.260 --> 07:08.728
Kalani got to
the point she is

07:08.728 --> 07:11.731
because of Kira manipulating
behind the scenes.

07:11.731 --> 07:15.302
Don't sit there
and lie like a (bleep) bitch.

07:16.436 --> 07:19.506
But we already have
a lot of drama with Abby

07:19.506 --> 07:21.908
<i>not wanting to teach our kids.</i>

07:21.908 --> 07:25.078
I sure hope, when we arrive
in Arizona, that those two

07:25.078 --> 07:27.047
<i>can keep it together</i>

07:27.047 --> 07:29.082
<i>so we can stay focused</i>
<i>on the dance.</i>

07:29.082 --> 07:30.884
GIANNA: Guys, let's review
from the top.

07:30.884 --> 07:33.820
So another day without Abby.

07:35.555 --> 07:38.024
God, this is driving me nuts.

07:38.024 --> 07:39.693
Holly, what do we tell
the children?

07:39.693 --> 07:42.329
HOLLY:
At this point,

07:42.329 --> 07:43.463
I am...

07:43.463 --> 07:45.699
very much prepared
to follow up

07:45.699 --> 07:48.101
with the conversation with
Debbie Allen and to see

07:48.101 --> 07:50.003
if she'll let us

<i>And...</i>

24:21.160 --> 24:22.661
they should look amazing.

24:23.762 --> 24:25.931
Nice.

24:25.931 --> 24:27.633
Now, girls, when you
step out on that stage,

24:27.633 --> 24:29.168
I want you to be
what people

24:29.168 --> 24:30.636
expect you to be.

24:30.636 --> 24:32.204
Right?

24:32.204 --> 24:35.207
You guys work together
like a well‐oiled machine?

24:35.207 --> 24:37.042
Especially on weeks
when I'm not here,

24:37.042 --> 24:41.547
when I have a business to run
and I have things to do

24:41.547 --> 24:43.315
and I have battles
to fight.

24:43.315 --> 24:46.051
You need to be
that well‐oiled machine

24:46.051 --> 24:48.654
that the Abby Lee
Dance Company created.

24:52.257 --> 24:54.059
ABBY LEE:
<i>Coming up on</i> Dance Moms...

24:54.059 --> 24:55.995
Someone with three baby daddies
and a criminal record?

24:55.995 --> 24:57.396
Just go home.
You don't want to be here,

24:57.396 --> 24:58.464
just go home!

24:58.464 --> 24:59.932
(bleep) you all.

25:01.100 --> 25:03.235
ANNOUNCER:
Teen solo contemporary,

25:03.235 --> 25:04.336
"Phoenix Star."

25:11.243 --> 25:14.113
(girls cheering)

25:15.214 --> 25:17.216
Come on, guys!

25:20.085 --> 25:23.022
ASHLEE: <i>I'm a little bit more</i>
<i>nervous for this competition</i>

25:23.022 --> 25:24.990
<i>than I have been</i>
<i>the other ones,</i>

25:24.990 --> 25:26.692
because this isn't only
Kalani's hometown,

25:26.692 --> 25:28.460
this is Brynn's.

25:28.460 --> 25:30.062
And she has
something to prove here

25:30.062 --> 25:31.263
<i>by beating Kalani.</i>

25:31.263 --> 25:33.098
<i>She has to prove</i>
<i>that she is good enough</i>

25:33.098 --> 25:34.666
<i>to be on this team permanently,</i>

25:34.666 --> 25:36.001
whether Maddie is here or not.

25:36.001 --> 25:38.003
MELISSA:
Where is... where's Kalani?

25:38.003 --> 25:39.171
She has a solo.

25:39.171 --> 25:40.739
That stresses me out.

25:40.739 --> 25:42.441
HOLLY:
Well, you know, a new baby

25:42.441 --> 25:43.876
can throw a monkey wrench
into anything.

25:43.876 --> 25:45.210
But she always gets
special treatment,

25:45.210 --> 25:46.812
and you guys know it.
JESSALYNN: Kira doesn't care.

25:46.812 --> 25:48.547
It's obvious
she still doesn't care.

25:48.547 --> 25:50.482
ASHLEE:
She doesn't care.
She still doesn't care.

25:50.482 --> 25:51.483
HOLLY:
Have you heard from her?

25:51.483 --> 25:52.951
Did she say, "Sorry,
I'm running late"?

25:52.951 --> 25:54.720
Did she send anyone a text?
MELISSA:
No, she didn't text me.

25:54.720 --> 25:55.721
And Kalani didn't
text me either.

25:55.721 --> 25:56.722
HOLLY:
That's a little weird.

25:56.722 --> 25:57.790
I don't... I have no say.

25:57.790 --> 25:58.791
I don't know.

26:00.359 --> 26:02.928
I don't care if she walks in
five minutes before she's on.

26:02.928 --> 26:04.329
Kalani is 15.

26:04.329 --> 26:06.598
She pulls your age up every time
she dances in the group.

26:06.598 --> 26:08.867
When Kira's around,
she can't get her here on time,

26:08.867 --> 26:10.769
she's not even in California
with her kid.

26:10.769 --> 26:12.704
JILL:
<i>Ashlee must be</i>

26:12.704 --> 26:16.041
really nervous for today,
because she's telling everybody

26:16.041 --> 26:18.610
all the reasons why
Kira and Kalani should leave

26:18.610 --> 26:20.712
and her and Brynn should stay.

26:20.712 --> 26:22.214
As much I like Kalani,

26:22.214 --> 26:24.783
Kira does not
care about this.

26:24.783 --> 26:26.218
She's just sitting
on her ass at home.

26:26.218 --> 26:27.386
And we're all
working our asses off

26:27.386 --> 26:29.221
and she's getting
the benefits of it.

26:29.221 --> 26:31.090
You're working your asses off?

26:31.090 --> 26:32.424
ASHLEE:
Uh, yeah.

26:32.424 --> 26:34.293
It's not easy, okay?
And you know it.

26:34.293 --> 26:36.161
(laughs)

26:36.161 --> 26:38.597
JILL:
Well, we were just saying

26:38.597 --> 26:41.166
that we were all on time
and you're a little late.

26:41.166 --> 26:46.305
I didn't realize that, um,
having to pump milk for the day

26:46.305 --> 26:48.373
and get the baby all settled
and explain...

26:48.373 --> 26:49.808
JILL:
No, I know. We know.

26:49.808 --> 26:51.677
... was the easiest thing.
But listen. No one says...

26:51.677 --> 26:54.213
The hardest job in the world
is being a mother.
It's been eight years.

26:54.213 --> 26:56.715
And we all are
and we've all done it.

26:56.715 --> 26:58.884
It's been eight years,
so... you forget.

26:58.884 --> 27:00.819
She's never cared;
that's the reality.

27:00.819 --> 27:02.221
Guess what.

27:02.221 --> 27:04.289
I've‐I've said 1,000 times
about me being here,

27:04.289 --> 27:05.424
and they all know it.

27:05.424 --> 27:07.025
ASHLEE:
So, then, why are you here?

27:07.025 --> 27:08.460
Then leave.

27:08.460 --> 27:09.795
Because Kalani wants to be here.

27:09.795 --> 27:11.130
Brynn wants to be here

27:11.130 --> 27:13.132
and I have to be here
and I show up and I work hard.

27:13.132 --> 27:16.802
She gets all the benefits
and she gets to sit home.

27:16.802 --> 27:18.337
You're a manipulator,
you're a user, you're a liar,

27:18.337 --> 27:19.972
and you know it‐‐
everybody knows it.

27:19.972 --> 27:21.740
I‐I don't really care
what you think of me.

27:21.740 --> 27:22.741
I really don't.

27:22.741 --> 27:24.243
I don't care what you think.

27:24.243 --> 27:26.111
A woman with three baby daddies
and a criminal record?

27:26.111 --> 27:27.980
I could care less
what you think about me.

27:30.015 --> 27:31.717
Just keep coming
with them, Ashlee.

27:31.717 --> 27:33.519
(scoffs) I could. All day long.
This is what I mean.

27:33.519 --> 27:35.621
How long do you want
to sit here?
This is what
I'm talking about.

27:35.621 --> 27:36.955
How long do you
want to sit here?

27:36.955 --> 27:38.090
You're a real pathetical person.

27:38.090 --> 27:40.058
"Pathetical" isn't a word.

27:40.058 --> 27:41.560
I thought you had
a master's degree.

27:41.560 --> 27:43.695
Did you not know

27:43.695 --> 27:46.031
that "pathetical" isn't a word,
but you have a master's degree?

27:47.566 --> 27:50.269
KIRA: You can sit here and
say all you want, Ashlee.

27:50.269 --> 27:54.473
Sit there with your liposuction
and your plastic surgery

27:54.473 --> 27:57.209
and your tummy tuck.
Oh, my gosh!

27:57.209 --> 27:59.378
Just go home. You don't want
to be here, just go home!

27:59.378 --> 28:01.313
Nobody wants you here. Go.

28:01.313 --> 28:03.482
I'm not here to play
your (bleep) games.

28:03.482 --> 28:04.783
I know you start cussing when

28:04.783 --> 28:06.418
you really don't know
what else to say.

28:06.418 --> 28:08.353
Do you want to let her sit here
and play her (bleep) games?

28:08.353 --> 28:10.289
ASHLEE:
I'm not playing games.

28:11.323 --> 28:12.858
Fine.

28:12.858 --> 28:14.026
JILL:
No, Kira, don't go.

28:14.026 --> 28:15.194
No, I'm done.
Please don't go.

28:15.194 --> 28:16.495
Please don't go.

28:16.495 --> 28:17.596
KIRA: If you want
to sit here and let her

28:17.596 --> 28:19.898
play her (bleep) games,
then you can.

28:19.898 --> 28:21.200
(bleep) you all.

28:22.334 --> 28:23.602
She's a (bleep) bitch.
Well, maybe...

28:23.602 --> 28:24.836
And I'm not
gonna sit here

28:24.836 --> 28:26.972
and allow her
to play her (bleep) games.

28:26.972 --> 28:28.173
So go (bleep) yourself.

28:28.173 --> 28:29.441
This is why

28:29.441 --> 28:30.776
she's a pathetic
piece of (bleep)!

28:34.079 --> 28:36.081
JILL:
<i>This is not the time for Ashlee</i>

28:36.081 --> 28:38.183
<i>to bring up old issues</i>
<i>with Kira.</i>

28:38.183 --> 28:40.385
<i>We already have</i>
<i>a checked‐out Abby.</i>

28:40.385 --> 28:41.420
We do not need

28:41.420 --> 28:42.821
<i>these moms fighting.</i>

28:42.821 --> 28:44.957
<i>We're supposed to be</i>
<i>a well‐oiled machine,</i>

28:44.957 --> 28:46.758
and it's not gonna work

28:46.758 --> 28:48.961
if these two moms
don't lay off of each other.

28:50.128 --> 28:51.797
(door opens)
It's okay.

28:51.797 --> 28:53.498
Don't let her
push you out.
Oh, I know it's okay.

28:53.498 --> 28:55.234
I'm fine.
Please don't let
her push you out.

28:55.234 --> 28:56.835
No. But I'm not doing this.
You've been under
so much pressure.

28:56.835 --> 28:58.704
I'm not doing this.
She pushed and pushed
and pushed.

28:58.704 --> 29:00.105
I'm not doing this.

29:00.105 --> 29:01.506
Please don't...
Yeah, but I'm not
playing the game.

29:01.506 --> 29:03.108
I know, but it is a game.
This is not why I'm here.

29:03.108 --> 29:04.109
I'm going home.

29:05.577 --> 29:06.712
What happened?
Okay, don't go.

29:06.712 --> 29:08.413
You know how she is.
KALANI:
Ashlee?

29:08.413 --> 29:10.349
She's being fake,
she's being desperate.
I'm not playing the games.

29:10.349 --> 29:12.584
You're way better
than she'll ever be.
Yeah, but... exactly.

29:12.584 --> 29:13.986
And I'm not playing the games.

29:13.986 --> 29:17.322
It just sucks that
somebody else comes in

29:17.322 --> 29:18.991
and they're not even on the team

29:18.991 --> 29:20.392
and you're the one
who's leaving.

29:20.392 --> 29:21.460
JILL:
This is an amazing solo.

29:21.460 --> 29:22.527
I know, it is.

29:22.527 --> 29:23.729
She's the...
she's the Arizona Star.

29:23.729 --> 29:24.963
She's gonna win
the whole thing today.

29:24.963 --> 29:26.632
So freaking
amazing...
I'll watch her,

29:26.632 --> 29:28.066
but I'm not
dealing with <i>her.</i>

29:28.066 --> 29:29.034

29:29.034 --> 29:31.403
JILL:
<i>Ashlee needs to learn</i>

29:33.071 --> 29:35.574
<i>Brynn and Ashlee are not.</i>

Okay. Stop. Back up.

34:08.980 --> 34:11.750
because she is so mad

34:11.750 --> 34:13.451
<i>that we took matters</i>
<i>into our own hands.</i>

34:13.451 --> 34:14.819
ABBY LEE:
Wait a minute.

34:14.819 --> 34:15.987
Wait a minute.

34:15.987 --> 34:18.023
What if we put
that burgundy skirt on

34:18.023 --> 34:19.491
underneath

34:19.491 --> 34:21.826
the suspenders,
but over the shorts?

34:21.826 --> 34:23.328
Look in here
and see if there's shorts.

34:24.729 --> 34:28.166
Yeah, take the leotard off,
put the new shorts on.

34:28.166 --> 34:30.435
I don't care how they fit,
just put them on.

34:30.435 --> 34:32.437
HOLLY: Honestly,
the costumes are what,

34:32.437 --> 34:33.638
five points of the dance?

34:33.638 --> 34:35.006
I mean, why don't we focus
on the dance itself

34:35.006 --> 34:36.575
rather than the costume?

34:36.575 --> 34:39.778
I pride myself
on making my dancers

34:39.778 --> 34:41.146
look good on stage.

34:41.146 --> 34:42.814
HOLLY: Well, you know what,
Abby, this could've been done

34:42.814 --> 34:44.249
days ago.
There's no need for this.

34:44.249 --> 34:47.452
Okay, well, if you don't feel
your child can dance

34:47.452 --> 34:49.321
and handle all this
pressure, it's okay.

34:49.321 --> 34:50.455
We can reblock it.

34:50.455 --> 34:52.324
HOLLY: No, that's not my point.
My point is

34:52.324 --> 34:54.225
you were not here
to do your job this week.

34:54.225 --> 34:55.460
We all know it;
I'm just voicing it.

34:55.460 --> 34:56.695
And I think the girls

34:56.695 --> 34:59.264
want to dance, and now
they're getting sidetracked

34:59.264 --> 35:00.432
'cause you're focused
on just costumes

35:00.432 --> 35:01.766
instead of the dance.

35:01.766 --> 35:03.768
ABBY LEE:
Whoa!

35:03.768 --> 35:05.637
You are making this whole
costume thing my fault.

35:05.637 --> 35:07.272
HOLLY and JESSALYNN:
It is your fault!

35:07.272 --> 35:08.940
JESSALYNN:
You didn't bring costumes!

35:08.940 --> 35:10.008
You didn't show up
to do your job!

35:10.008 --> 35:11.309
You brought costumes

35:11.309 --> 35:13.645
that have booty shorts
that you can see every line in!

35:13.645 --> 35:15.413
They had black on;
they looked great!

35:15.413 --> 35:17.749
You're messing them up
and flustering them.

35:17.749 --> 35:19.351
No one else is.

35:19.351 --> 35:20.418
You are.

35:20.418 --> 35:21.653
Because you don't your job.

35:22.654 --> 35:23.788
You're just stupid.

35:23.788 --> 35:25.490
You don't even know
what you have.

35:26.925 --> 35:29.861
JILL: <i>Abby is upset and angry</i>
<i>about our costumes.</i>

35:29.861 --> 35:31.963
<i>Well, news flash.</i>

35:31.963 --> 35:33.565
We're angry
that you can't show up.

35:33.565 --> 35:35.066
We're angry that you can't
get dressed.

35:35.066 --> 35:37.302
<i>We're angry</i>
<i>that everything else</i>

35:37.302 --> 35:39.571
is more important
than these girls right now.

35:39.571 --> 35:40.605
Five, six, seven, eight,
one, two, three, four,

35:40.605 --> 35:41.706
five, six, seven, eight, one...

35:41.706 --> 35:43.475
The entire week,
Abby has not been around.

35:43.475 --> 35:45.543
<i>We had to go</i>
<i>to a different studio.</i>

35:45.543 --> 35:47.479
We had to get our own costumes.

35:48.480 --> 35:50.915
<i>So important that we rise up</i>

35:50.915 --> 35:54.853
<i>and we can prevail</i>
<i>through any of Abby's</i>

35:54.853 --> 35:56.221
<i>erratic behavior.</i>

35:56.221 --> 35:59.224
ANNOUNCER:

35:59.224 --> 36:00.925

ABBY LEE:
<i>Coming up on</i> Dance Moms...

36:08.967 --> 36:10.435

36:10.435 --> 36:11.703

36:26.217 --> 36:28.987
<i>a really tough week</i>

36:28.987 --> 36:30.655
I just hope and pray
that the girls

36:30.655 --> 36:33.525

JILL:
<i>These kids,</i>

38:27.872 --> 38:30.508
<i>they've been put through</i>
<i>the wringer this week,</i>

38:30.508 --> 38:33.411
<i>but the "Well‐Oiled Machine"</i>
<i>worked.</i>

38:33.411 --> 38:37.215
It went onstage, did its job,
and it drove off.

38:37.215 --> 38:38.216
<i>They were great.</i>

38:38.216 --> 38:40.151
<i>I just hope it's enough to win</i>

38:40.151 --> 38:41.352
here in Arizona.

38:44.355 --> 38:46.291
(crowd cheering)

38:52.163 --> 38:53.598
Are we ready?
We have a good time today?

38:53.598 --> 38:55.600
(crowd cheering)

38:57.435 --> 38:59.037
Let's do the high scores.

39:00.772 --> 39:02.040
Can we get a drumroll?

39:04.075 --> 39:07.345
ASHLEE: <i>For years,</i>
<i>Kira has lied and manipulated</i>

39:07.345 --> 39:09.414
to get Kalani ahead,
and today's the day

39:09.414 --> 39:11.115
<i>that it's all gonna catch up</i>
<i>with her.</i>

39:11.115 --> 39:12.417
<i>Kalani's not gonna place</i>
<i>higher than Brynn,</i>

39:12.417 --> 39:14.052
<i>and that's gonna prove</i>
<i>that Brynn's</i>

39:14.052 --> 39:17.055
<i>a valuable member of this team,</i>
<i>whether Maddie is here or not.</i>

39:17.055 --> 39:20.525
So, for the overall high score
solo, duo, trio...

39:23.194 --> 39:25.697
First place goes to...

39:29.634 --> 39:31.803
...entry number 74.

39:31.803 --> 39:33.404
(crowd cheering)

39:33.404 --> 39:36.341
(whooping)

39:36.341 --> 39:38.276
JILL:
<i>Ashlee came in saying,</i>

39:38.276 --> 39:40.411
"Brynn always wins,
Brynn's the best.

39:40.411 --> 39:42.981
<i>Her technique's better</i>
<i>than everybody."</i>

39:42.981 --> 39:44.716
<i>You know what?</i>
<i>She didn't place.</i>

39:44.716 --> 39:45.850
<i>So learn a lesson, Ashlee.</i>

39:45.850 --> 39:48.052
You can't always win.

39:48.052 --> 39:49.821
There's always someone better.

39:50.922 --> 39:53.191
So next we have
overall high score group.

39:53.191 --> 39:54.559
MELISSA: <i>This has been</i>
<i>a really tough week</i>

39:54.559 --> 39:55.560
<i>for our girls.</i>

39:55.560 --> 39:56.661
They've shown up.

39:56.661 --> 39:57.929
They've worked their butts off.

39:57.929 --> 40:00.398
<i>Which is more than</i>
<i>I can say about Abby.</i>

40:00.398 --> 40:01.666
<i>So, no matter</i>
<i>what happens today,</i>

40:01.666 --> 40:03.101
<i>I'm very proud of them.</i>

40:05.970 --> 40:07.705
Second place...

40:11.109 --> 40:13.611
...entry number 66, "Firestone."

40:13.611 --> 40:14.913
(crowd cheering)

40:17.849 --> 40:19.751
And the first place goes to...

40:24.856 --> 40:28.593
...entry number 75,
"Well‐Oiled Machine."

40:28.593 --> 40:30.695
(crowd cheering)

40:32.630 --> 40:35.433
JESSALYNN: <i>I'm so happy</i>
<i>the girls won first place.</i>

40:35.433 --> 40:36.768
<i>We're in Phoenix.</i>

40:36.768 --> 40:38.836
<i>This is a hard competition.</i>

40:38.836 --> 40:42.273
They won with Gianna's help
and the moms' support.

40:42.273 --> 40:44.275
<i>Not with Abby's help.</i>

40:44.275 --> 40:45.743
<i>Abby,</i>

40:45.743 --> 40:47.178
we did it without you.

40:47.178 --> 40:48.846
Girls!

40:48.846 --> 40:53.785
Congratulations!
Congratulations.

40:53.785 --> 40:54.819
Congratulations.

40:54.819 --> 40:55.987
Congratulations.

40:55.987 --> 40:57.989
Why am I here?
I didn't need to come.

41:00.692 --> 41:03.294
Don't you think you
should lead by example?

41:03.294 --> 41:05.797
No, I don't. I'm not a dancer.
I don't pretend to be one.

41:05.797 --> 41:07.165
JESSALYNN:
I didn't ask you about that.

41:07.165 --> 41:09.467
I asked you
about not showing up to class

41:09.467 --> 41:10.702
and then showing up
and eating lunch in your car

41:10.702 --> 41:11.803
while the kids
are in there working.

41:11.803 --> 41:14.105
That's not a good example.

41:14.105 --> 41:16.040
Well, do as I say, not as I do.

41:16.040 --> 41:19.744
JESSALYNN:
<i>Abby is too stubborn to admit</i>

41:19.744 --> 41:21.479
she is messed up.

41:21.479 --> 41:22.447
JILL: Where do we go
from here, Abby?

41:22.447 --> 41:24.215
Next week, are you gonna be

41:24.215 --> 41:26.718
in the studio with,
when the kids show up?

41:26.718 --> 41:28.286
Unless a truck runs me over.

41:28.286 --> 41:29.554
Okay, good, so we got that
hashed out.

41:29.554 --> 41:30.922
ASHLEE: So does that mean
Brynn will be

41:30.922 --> 41:33.624
on the pyramid
if you're gonna do it?

41:33.624 --> 41:35.293
Your seventh dancer‐‐
you finally got her.

41:35.293 --> 41:36.694
Well, Maddie's back.

41:38.663 --> 41:41.499
So I think Brynn is...
on probation.

41:42.967 --> 41:44.602
No, I'm not coming back
as long as she's there.

41:44.602 --> 41:46.704
So if she stays,
you're not coming back?

41:47.705 --> 41:48.973
You hate her that much?

41:48.973 --> 41:49.841
Yeah.

41:56.748 --> 41:59.183
The group routine‐‐ we're doing
the seven deadly sins.

41:59.183 --> 42:01.419
JILL:
<i>Think of the seven deadly sins.</i>

42:01.419 --> 42:03.654
Every single one of them applies

42:03.654 --> 42:05.690
<i>to one person in that room.</i>

42:05.690 --> 42:06.791
ABBY LEE: Maddie,
you're here now.

42:06.791 --> 42:08.126
<i>You should be better than ever.</i>

42:08.126 --> 42:09.527
You're just
rushing through.

42:09.527 --> 42:10.561
Why did you not watch Maddie

42:10.561 --> 42:11.996
<i>on</i> The Ellen Show?

42:11.996 --> 42:13.998
ASHLEE: Do you feel like
you're jealous of her success?

42:13.998 --> 42:15.566
You know what, Abby?
You have problems

42:15.566 --> 42:17.468
<i>that are not mine!</i>

42:17.468 --> 42:20.138
JILL: <i>Abby has to get</i>
<i>her passion back.</i>

42:20.138 --> 42:22.340
ABBY LEE:
<i>I sacrifice everything</i>

42:22.340 --> 42:25.843
for your kids.
I'm sick and tired of fighting.
