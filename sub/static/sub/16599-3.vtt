No more than a month.

DANNY: Dr. Brown,
you were a behavioral analyst

00:24.692 --> 00:26.191
with the FBI for 15 years.

00:26.193 --> 00:27.526
You profiled
a lot of serial killers.

00:27.528 --> 00:29.328
Hein, Larsen and Shaw all
had something in common.

00:29.330 --> 00:32.064
Each one of them
was being investigated

00:32.066 --> 00:35.401
by an HPD homicide detective
named Philip Lau.

00:35.403 --> 00:37.803
<i> Lau shot and killed himself</i>
<i> six months ago.</i>

KONO:
Oh, yeah?

03:16.564 --> 03:18.697
When did you tell her?

03:18.699 --> 03:21.366
A couple days ago.

03:21.368 --> 03:23.535
How'd she take it?

03:25.806 --> 03:27.906
She was hurt.

03:29.843 --> 03:32.711
Why do I have to go live
with someone else?

03:32.713 --> 03:35.614
No, sweetie.

03:35.616 --> 03:38.450
They're not just someone else,
they're family.

03:38.452 --> 03:40.586
You belong with them.

03:40.588 --> 03:42.988
But so are you, right?

03:42.990 --> 03:45.824
You're family.

03:47.561 --> 03:51.396
I want to live with you,
Uncle Chin.

03:59.907 --> 04:03.242
I'm sorry.

04:03.244 --> 04:05.444
It's okay, it's for the best.

04:08.415 --> 04:11.416
Still, it doesn't make
it hurt any less.

04:14.488 --> 04:17.589
You know, have you thought
about... maybe...

04:17.591 --> 04:21.727
Fighting it?

04:21.729 --> 04:24.830
Yeah, I have.

04:24.832 --> 04:27.399
But I don't want to put Sara
in the middle of all that.

04:27.401 --> 04:29.801
Poor kid's already
been through enough, you know?

04:29.803 --> 04:32.638
Besides, what grounds
would I have?

04:32.640 --> 04:36.708
Background check on her family
turned up zero red flags.

04:36.710 --> 04:38.377
Her uncle is an attorney.

04:38.379 --> 04:40.545
Her aunt works for a
pharmaceutical company.

04:40.547 --> 04:43.882
They both volunteer
at church.

04:43.884 --> 04:46.451
They're everything
that Gabriel wasn't.

04:46.453 --> 04:48.920
Well, you know, I could
always go down there

04:48.922 --> 04:50.589
and plant something.

04:50.591 --> 04:52.758
Get the judge to put
the brakes on the adoption.

04:55.529 --> 04:57.829
(laughs)

04:57.831 --> 04:59.464
I appreciate that, cuz.

04:59.466 --> 05:00.465
I appreciate it very much.

05:00.467 --> 05:01.700

Thank you.

05:01.702 --> 05:03.435

05:06.607 --> 05:08.674
Hello.

05:11.045 --> 05:12.044
Of course.

Everything okay?

05:21.955 --> 05:24.990

05:24.992 --> 05:26.858
Unis picked her up last night
on a D & D.

05:26.860 --> 05:29.561
When she woke up,
we gave her a phone call

05:29.563 --> 05:32.097
and she asked for your number.

05:32.099 --> 05:33.665
Rosey Valera.

05:33.667 --> 05:35.400
I haven't thought
about her in ages.

05:35.402 --> 05:37.102
How do you two know each other?

05:37.104 --> 05:38.704
PJN.

05:38.706 --> 05:40.906
We used to compete
against each other.

05:40.908 --> 05:45.077
Rosey was one of the
best surfers on the tour.

05:45.079 --> 05:46.545
Open one.

05:46.547 --> 05:48.413
(door buzzes)
Last one on the left.

05:48.415 --> 05:49.614
Thanks, Duke.

05:54.655 --> 05:58.056
(indistinct radio chatter)

06:06.533 --> 06:07.666
Rosey?

06:08.635 --> 06:12.571
Kono.

06:12.573 --> 06:14.139
Thanks for coming.

06:14.141 --> 06:16.007
I'm sorry.

06:16.009 --> 06:18.944
I heard you were
a cop now and...

06:18.946 --> 06:21.012
I didn't know
who else to call.

06:21.982 --> 06:23.582
It's okay.

06:23.584 --> 06:26.551
Come on,
let's get you out of here.

06:39.032 --> 06:40.065
Yo.

06:40.067 --> 06:42.467
Hey, I heard about your morning.

06:42.469 --> 06:43.869
How's Brown doing?

06:43.871 --> 06:45.637
Well, for a woman who's spent
her entire adult life

06:45.639 --> 06:47.873
hunting serial killers,
she's pretty shaken up.

06:47.875 --> 06:49.107
She's invested now,
which is good,

06:49.109 --> 06:50.776
'cause we need
all the help we can get.

06:50.778 --> 06:52.311
What about the guy in the bed?

06:52.312 --> 06:53.845
You I.D. him?
Ben Rhodes, transient.

06:53.847 --> 06:55.847
He's in the system
for a couple of minor felonies.

06:55.849 --> 06:57.849
HPD's retracing his steps,

06:57.850 --> 06:59.850
but the M.E. seems to think
he was killed inside the house.

06:59.853 --> 07:01.653
We're gonna know more
after the autopsy.

07:01.655 --> 07:02.888
What's up with
the crime scene?

07:02.890 --> 07:04.456
CSU processed, it's clean.

07:04.458 --> 07:06.525
They can't even find evidence
of forced entry.

07:06.527 --> 07:08.126
See, here's what's
interesting to me, okay?

07:08.128 --> 07:10.762
The guy's not a killer,
not as far as we know,

07:10.764 --> 07:12.764
so why the pawn in the mouth?
That should not make sense.

07:12.766 --> 07:14.699
Well, it could.
Check it out,

07:14.701 --> 07:17.002
pawns aren't always used
for attack, okay?

07:17.004 --> 07:20.472
Sometimes we sacrifice pawns
for a purpose, no?

07:20.474 --> 07:24.676
What if the killer sacrificed
Rhodes to send a message?

07:24.678 --> 07:27.679
Like the game is still on.

07:29.516 --> 07:31.049
All right, what's going on here?

07:31.051 --> 07:32.818
Oh, well, this is
the former homeowner.

07:32.820 --> 07:35.437
His name is Akamu.

07:35.438 --> 07:38.055
Cause of death, single
gunshot wound to the chest.

07:38.058 --> 07:39.825
Okay, call said there
were two bodies.

07:39.827 --> 07:41.626
There are two bodies.

07:41.628 --> 07:43.195
Second body is upstairs.

07:43.197 --> 07:46.498
Ah, don't go up there,
you don't want to see that.

07:46.500 --> 07:48.233
Cause of death of
victim number two?

07:48.235 --> 07:52.771
10,000 foot high dive,
right through the roof.

07:53.974 --> 07:56.575
The M.E. managed to get
a print off of what was left.

07:56.577 --> 07:58.543
Print belongs to
Special Agent Hank Evers.

07:58.545 --> 08:00.245
Special Agent?

08:00.247 --> 08:02.013
DEA.

08:02.015 --> 08:04.583
We're trying to get in contact
with the supervisors now.

08:04.585 --> 08:06.618
All right, what do we think
happened here?

08:06.620 --> 08:08.653
Not exactly sure,
but I think this whole thing

08:08.655 --> 08:10.255
could be connected
to a plane crash

08:10.257 --> 08:12.991
that happened on the North Shore
about two hours ago.

08:12.993 --> 08:14.726
How do you figure?
Because the NTSB said

08:14.728 --> 08:17.596
that the pilot of that plane
was shot dead

08:17.598 --> 08:19.498
before the plane went down.

08:19.500 --> 08:20.999
And get this,

08:21.001 --> 08:23.134
the caliber bullet used
to kill that pilot,

08:23.136 --> 08:25.937
same caliber bullet
used to kill this guy.

08:27.774 --> 08:29.207
You're thinking
the same shooter?

08:29.209 --> 08:30.208
Yeah, looks like it.

08:30.210 --> 08:33.545
CHIN:
Guys, over here.

08:34.615 --> 08:36.081
Got a parachute.

08:36.083 --> 08:37.816
It's freshly buried,
I'm guessing

08:37.818 --> 08:39.885
it belonged to our shooter.

08:39.886 --> 08:41.953
So this guy, he throws Evers
out of an airplane...

08:44.291 --> 08:45.757
<i> ...then he shoots the pilot,</i>

08:45.759 --> 08:47.559
<i> jumps out with</i>
<i> his own parachute.</i>

08:47.561 --> 08:50.262
<i> He shoots a witness as soon</i>
<i> as he gets to the ground.</i>

08:51.932 --> 08:53.932
Sounds about right.

08:53.933 --> 08:55.933
Our shooter went through a whole
lot of trouble to make sure

08:55.936 --> 08:57.903
he wasn't on that
plane when it landed.

08:57.905 --> 08:58.970
Makes you wonder
what was waiting for him.

09:08.916 --> 09:10.549
ROSEY:<i> I don't think</i>
<i> you ever met my father.</i>

09:10.551 --> 09:12.217
Only your mom.

09:12.219 --> 09:14.252
She used to come
to all the events.

09:14.254 --> 09:16.021
Yeah.

09:16.023 --> 09:18.723
My dad didn't care
much for surfing.

09:18.725 --> 09:20.959
He was in the Army
for 25 years.

09:20.961 --> 09:22.794
And any career
out of the service

09:22.796 --> 09:25.096
was just something
he couldn't understand.

09:28.635 --> 09:31.036
After 9/11, he looked
at me differently.

09:31.038 --> 09:33.805
Like I was some
big disappointment.

09:35.876 --> 09:39.044
A year after you
blew out your knee,

09:39.046 --> 09:41.880
I left the circuit and enlisted.

09:41.882 --> 09:45.216
Two years later,
I got sent to Iraq.

09:45.218 --> 09:47.218
I was part of a convoy escort.

09:48.589 --> 09:50.188
One day we were cutting
a path through East Ramadi

09:50.190 --> 09:52.791
<i> when our unit was attacked. </i>
(explosions and gunfire)

09:52.793 --> 09:53.892
<i> We took an alternate route.</i>

09:53.894 --> 09:57.262
<i> Drove right over an IED.</i>

09:59.967 --> 10:02.334
And here I am.

10:05.839 --> 10:07.606
Hey, what ever
happened with Kimo?

10:07.608 --> 10:09.107
(chuckles)

10:09.109 --> 10:11.643
We never officially broke up,

10:11.645 --> 10:13.979
but I heard he got married
a few years ago.

10:13.981 --> 10:17.282
Lives in Haleiwa
with his wife and two kids.

10:17.284 --> 10:19.884
Everybody was right about him.

10:19.886 --> 10:21.886
Yeah.

10:21.888 --> 10:24.389
But he was so hot, right?

10:24.391 --> 10:26.625
All the girls wanted him,
but he was yours.

10:31.632 --> 10:34.899
Hey, uh...
are you hungry?

10:34.901 --> 10:36.234
Starving.

10:36.236 --> 10:37.636
You know what,
I know a chill spot

10:37.638 --> 10:38.637
just up the beach.

10:38.639 --> 10:40.238
Sounds great.

10:42.776 --> 10:45.777
(thunder rumbles)

10:45.779 --> 10:48.647
Agent Evers was with
the DEA for 16 years.

10:48.649 --> 10:50.815
He had a wife,
a daughter.

10:50.817 --> 10:52.751
He was one of those guys
that didn't say no.

10:52.753 --> 10:53.885
How long was he undercover?

10:53.887 --> 10:55.186
Almost 18 months.

10:55.188 --> 10:57.055
Thanks to his efforts,
we were about to take down

10:57.057 --> 11:00.191
this guy...
Hector Frontera.

11:00.193 --> 11:01.993
He's the Cali cartel's
representative

11:01.995 --> 11:03.361
in the Far East.

11:03.363 --> 11:04.829
Man's a serious player.

11:04.831 --> 11:06.798
He and Evers were
flying in for a meet

11:06.800 --> 11:08.833
with Frontera's U.S.
counterpart, Armando Sanchez.

11:08.835 --> 11:11.102
That was scheduled
for tomorrow night.

11:11.104 --> 11:13.838
The plane was due to land
at Kalaeloa at 8:00 a.m.

11:13.840 --> 11:15.807
We were on site to
take Frontera into custody

11:15.809 --> 11:17.476
when we heard about the crash.

11:17.477 --> 11:19.144
The fact that Frontera
knew you were waiting for him

11:19.146 --> 11:20.945
suggests to me
you got a leak.

11:20.947 --> 11:22.213
It also explains why
Frontera was traveling

11:22.215 --> 11:24.349
With $10 million cash
with him on the plane.

11:24.351 --> 11:25.817
According to Evers,

11:25.819 --> 11:27.452
Frontera's meeting
with Sanchez

11:27.454 --> 11:29.954
was to discuss
a new drug pipeline

11:29.956 --> 11:31.289
across Europe.

11:31.291 --> 11:33.291
He was gonna use
that money to disappear.

11:33.293 --> 11:34.826
That's what we're thinking.

11:34.828 --> 11:38.096
So one of your own guys
dimes out Evers,

11:38.098 --> 11:40.231
Frontera now knows
an arrest is imminent,

11:40.233 --> 11:42.267
so he pulls a D.B. Cooper.

11:42.269 --> 11:45.336
Yeah, except D.B. Cooper
disappeared.

11:45.338 --> 11:47.439
Frontera won't.

11:47.441 --> 11:50.308

11:59.252 --> 12:01.152
(tires screech,
horn honks)

12:01.154 --> 12:03.988

See? A gun.

STEVE:
Hey!

12:14.835 --> 12:16.101
Whoa, whoa.
What?

12:16.103 --> 12:17.970
All right, let me
just remind you,

12:17.971 --> 12:19.838
six weeks ago you were in the
hospital near death, okay?

12:19.840 --> 12:21.473
You remind me every hour.
I think you're exaggerating.

12:21.475 --> 12:22.974
Okay, every minute.

12:22.976 --> 12:24.609
Never mind, forget it.
Go ahead, I give up.

12:24.610 --> 12:26.243
You said that yesterday when
you found out I went for a swim.

12:26.246 --> 12:29.114
Who goes for a swim
after a liver transplant?

12:29.116 --> 12:30.949
You. You know why?
'Cause you're an idiot.

12:30.951 --> 12:33.485
I gotta go. Can I go? Please.

12:34.521 --> 12:37.489
Great. Okay, Spider-Man,
I'll see you down there.

12:49.202 --> 12:51.202

12:51.204 --> 12:53.938

14:00.373 --> 14:03.208

that fake smile.

14:18.992 --> 14:21.392
KONO: I really thought
I won that day.

14:21.394 --> 14:23.862
To be honest,
I hated seeing you

14:23.864 --> 14:25.163
with that trophy.

14:25.165 --> 14:27.565
We were supposed
to hate each other.

14:27.567 --> 14:29.100
We were competing.

14:29.102 --> 14:31.536
Winning and losing was
life and death at that time.

14:31.538 --> 14:33.438
We could never
be friends then.

14:33.440 --> 14:35.006
Well, I guess that's why
we never had

14:35.008 --> 14:36.474
a real conversation
before.

14:36.476 --> 14:40.111
You know...

14:40.113 --> 14:41.546
I always thought
you were better than me.

14:41.548 --> 14:43.348
Come on.

14:43.350 --> 14:45.350
Seriously.

14:45.352 --> 14:48.253
You made me better.

14:48.255 --> 14:51.289
When I won...

14:51.291 --> 14:54.959
it was only because I was
afraid to lose to you.

14:57.430 --> 14:59.297
I knew it was somewhere.

14:59.299 --> 15:01.032
Rosey Valera...

15:01.034 --> 15:03.368
charging and carving.

15:03.370 --> 15:05.169
Look at you!

15:05.171 --> 15:07.005
That was a long time ago.

15:07.007 --> 15:08.373
You mind signing it,
champ?

15:08.375 --> 15:09.941
Sure.

15:11.077 --> 15:12.677
And these T-shirts.

15:12.679 --> 15:14.245
Kamekona...

15:14.247 --> 15:16.381
Don't be jealous,
little sis.

15:16.383 --> 15:18.950
Well, can you at least wait
until she's done eating?

15:18.952 --> 15:20.518
It's fine.
I'm done anyway.

15:20.520 --> 15:22.687
Can you make it out
to Kamekona,

15:22.689 --> 15:25.657
purveyor of the best
shrimp on the Island?

15:25.659 --> 15:27.458
You got it.
Or...

15:27.460 --> 15:29.327
world's greatest
shrimp truck.

15:29.329 --> 15:33.064
Or...
the king of shellfish.

15:33.066 --> 15:35.633
Any superlative
would be fine.

15:35.635 --> 15:37.268
You got it.

15:37.270 --> 15:39.671
All right!

15:45.111 --> 15:47.145
I have no idea
where Frontera is.

15:47.147 --> 15:48.680
You know,
in my experience, usually,

15:48.682 --> 15:51.082
when, uh... when somebody
who looks like you--

15:51.084 --> 15:53.584
fancy shirt, expensive suit,
nice haircut--

15:53.586 --> 15:55.186
tells me that
he can't help me,

15:55.188 --> 15:56.688
then I think that he is lying.

15:56.690 --> 15:58.990
It's the truth.

15:58.992 --> 16:00.725
Oh, it's the truth.
Danny.

16:00.727 --> 16:01.726
Yeah?
Come here for a minute.

16:01.728 --> 16:03.962
Okay.

16:04.698 --> 16:07.065
What's up?

16:07.067 --> 16:09.667
Just pretend you're disagreeing
with me for a minute.

16:09.669 --> 16:11.202
Won't be very difficult,
but why?

16:11.204 --> 16:13.204
That's very funny.
What are you doing?

16:13.206 --> 16:14.272
What do you mean?
What are you doing?

16:14.274 --> 16:15.340
This is the
rendition room.

16:15.342 --> 16:16.474
You're embarrassing me.

16:16.475 --> 16:17.607
You think he's gonna
say something or what?

16:17.610 --> 16:19.210
Well, listen...

16:19.212 --> 16:20.578
You gonna make friends
in here, is that what...

16:20.580 --> 16:22.330
Well, I do what I do,
you do what...

16:22.331 --> 16:24.081
How about I do what I do?
Would you stop? Would you...?

16:24.084 --> 16:26.751
What, are you nuts?
Hey, are you nuts?

16:26.753 --> 16:28.353
DANNY: You gonna kill that guy?
STEVE: Take your hands off me.

16:28.354 --> 16:29.954
You gonna kill him?
No, I'm not gonna kill him.

16:29.955 --> 16:31.555
It's that big of a deal? Shoot
him in the leg, all right?

16:31.558 --> 16:32.941
Stop. Would you stop, please?
What are you talking about?

16:32.942 --> 16:34.325
Please stand over there
and let me do what I do.

16:34.327 --> 16:35.727
We need information.

16:35.729 --> 16:37.362
Can you let me do this?
Please stop.

16:37.364 --> 16:38.763
Two minutes.
You got two minutes.

16:38.765 --> 16:40.698
Two minutes. Put it away.
Please.

16:43.570 --> 16:45.503
(lock buzzes)

16:45.505 --> 16:46.771
(sighs)

16:46.773 --> 16:50.108
Okay... you know
who we are, right?

16:50.110 --> 16:51.376
Five-O.

16:51.378 --> 16:53.077
You know we're not
the cops, right?

16:53.079 --> 16:54.245
We can keep you here
indefinitely,

16:54.247 --> 16:55.246
nobody's gonna ask
any questions.

16:55.248 --> 16:57.132
You're aware of that, right?

16:57.133 --> 16:59.017
On my children, I'm
telling you the truth.

16:59.019 --> 17:01.386
I believe you.
That's the thing. I do!

17:01.388 --> 17:04.489
But, unfortunately, my very
impatient partner does not.

17:04.491 --> 17:07.025
Okay? So if you don't
start talking soon,

17:07.027 --> 17:09.027
he's gonna take over,
and you don't want that.

17:09.029 --> 17:10.294
You don't want him
to get involved,

17:10.296 --> 17:12.663
because when he gets involved,
things get messy.

17:12.665 --> 17:14.599
Expensive suits get ruined.

17:16.770 --> 17:18.803
The drain gets clogged.
Drain?

17:18.805 --> 17:20.738
Yeah. What do you think you got
a drain between your legs for?

17:27.680 --> 17:30.181
All right, just forget
about him for one second.

17:30.183 --> 17:31.582
Look at me.
Look at me.

17:31.584 --> 17:33.785
Let's say you get out
of here, all right?

17:33.787 --> 17:36.287
Where you gonna go?
Huh?

17:36.289 --> 17:38.556
I mean, the DEA, they already
put the word out on the street

17:38.558 --> 17:40.158
that you've been
picked up.

17:40.160 --> 17:41.292
What do you think's
gonna happen?

17:41.294 --> 17:42.360
What do you think's
gonna happen

17:42.362 --> 17:43.694
when your friends
in Mexico find out

17:43.696 --> 17:45.396
that you have become
a liability?

17:45.398 --> 17:48.199
Buddy, you've got
an expiration date.

17:48.201 --> 17:49.700
In fact, the-the-the milk
in my fridge

17:49.702 --> 17:51.602
has got more time
than you do.

17:51.604 --> 17:54.138
Here's the thing, though.

17:54.140 --> 17:55.239
I can help you.

17:55.241 --> 17:57.175
I can protect you,
I promise

17:57.177 --> 17:59.410
nothing will happen to you.

17:59.412 --> 18:01.145
But you gotta help us
find Frontera.

18:01.147 --> 18:02.981
But I told you.

18:02.982 --> 18:04.816
I-I understand, you
don't know where he is.

18:04.818 --> 18:07.452
But maybe you know
somebody who does.

18:07.454 --> 18:09.320
Somebody he trusts.

18:09.322 --> 18:11.456
Maybe the person
who told him

18:11.458 --> 18:13.257
that Evers was DEA

18:13.259 --> 18:16.794
Th... There is a person.

18:22.502 --> 18:24.636
You sure your intel's good?

18:24.637 --> 18:26.771
Because Armando Sanchez
is not the most reliable source.

18:26.773 --> 18:27.772
Yeah, well, it's
in his best interest

18:27.774 --> 18:29.057
to cooperate with us.

18:29.058 --> 18:30.341
All right, so how long
was Agent Raine

18:30.343 --> 18:31.442
on the Frontera case?

18:31.444 --> 18:33.177
She was there
from the beginning.

18:33.179 --> 18:34.245
Started as Evers' handler

18:34.247 --> 18:36.114
until he gained
Frontera's confidence.

18:36.116 --> 18:37.281
Once he was inside
I took over.

18:37.283 --> 18:38.549
But she was still in the loop.

18:38.551 --> 18:40.284
She had access to all our intel.

18:40.286 --> 18:41.752
She knew we were gonna move
on Frontera today.

18:41.754 --> 18:43.788
You know this woman.

18:43.790 --> 18:45.523
She gonna go quietly?

18:45.525 --> 18:47.859
Amy Raine's one
of our top agents.

18:47.861 --> 18:49.527
If she doesn't feel
like going to jail,

18:49.529 --> 18:51.229
you can expect a fight.

18:51.231 --> 18:52.597
Let's get it.

19:16.256 --> 19:16.821
(gunshot)
Gun!

19:16.823 --> 19:18.656
Move in!

19:24.531 --> 19:26.364
AGENT: Clear!

19:26.366 --> 19:27.732
AGENT 2: Clear!

19:27.734 --> 19:30.201
Clear!
Clear!

19:30.203 --> 19:31.669
Clear!

19:38.611 --> 19:39.810
STEVE:
Frontera!

20:18.885 --> 20:20.351
Frontera must have
seen us coming.

20:20.353 --> 20:22.553
He calls Raine from the bedroom,

20:22.555 --> 20:24.589
puts a bullet in her head,
(gunshot)

20:24.591 --> 20:27.358
<i>then grabs his cash and bounces</i>
<i> out of the window.</i>

20:27.360 --> 20:29.293
DEA SPECIAL AGENT:
<i> He used her as a distraction.</i>

20:29.295 --> 20:31.229
Yeah, but he dropped the cash.

20:31.231 --> 20:33.431
So now we got
a lone cowboy out there

20:33.433 --> 20:35.633
with no money, no friends,
and no local contacts.

20:35.635 --> 20:37.735
And he's not afraid
to kill law enforcement.

20:37.737 --> 20:39.671
That's why we're gonna
catch him

20:39.672 --> 20:41.606
before he puts
anybody else in the ground.

20:41.608 --> 20:43.975
(engine starts)

20:46.412 --> 20:48.446
Hey. Hey!
(tires screech)

20:53.453 --> 20:56.254

ones looking for Frontera.

21:02.595 --> 21:05.329
This is it, right here.

21:05.331 --> 21:06.597
Nice place.

21:06.599 --> 21:08.566
Yeah. It's pretty nice.

21:24.984 --> 21:26.851
Uh, can I help you inside?

21:26.853 --> 21:28.653
No, I'm fine.

21:29.789 --> 21:32.423
I just want to thank you
for today, Kono.

for talking story...

21:45.805 --> 21:47.838
Hey.

21:47.840 --> 21:49.040
Can we do this again?

21:49.042 --> 21:50.508
I'd like that.

21:50.510 --> 21:51.942
Okay, cool. I'll
call you next week.

21:51.944 --> 21:53.644

All right.

21:53.646 --> 21:55.079

Hey, Jerry.

23:06.919 --> 23:09.153
It was the day before
Thanksgiving, 1971,

23:09.155 --> 23:11.689
travelers were headed home
for Turkey Thursday.

23:11.691 --> 23:15.159
This particular flight was out
of Portland, headed for Seattle.

23:15.161 --> 23:16.961
Okay, uh, Jerry, what
are you talking about?

23:16.963 --> 23:19.764
Stay with me. He was wearing
a dark suit and a black tie.

23:19.766 --> 23:21.665
Who? Johnny Cash?

23:23.770 --> 23:25.569
Don't ignore him,
he'll get worse.

23:25.571 --> 23:29.073
Okay, it was not Johnny Cash.
It was a different man in black.

23:29.075 --> 23:30.975
Will Smith.

23:30.977 --> 23:32.977
Tommy Lee Jones.

23:32.979 --> 23:35.112
I'm gonna disregard your advice
and ignore him.

23:35.114 --> 23:37.748
It's fine, just, maybe if you...
finished the story, it'll help.

23:37.750 --> 23:40.151
Okay. So, this man in black,
who was not Johnny Cash,

23:40.153 --> 23:43.454
Will Smith or Tommy Lee Jones,
is midway through his flight

23:43.456 --> 23:46.190
to Seattle, when he shows
a suitcase with a bomb inside

23:46.192 --> 23:48.692
to the stewardess,
and hijacks the plane.

23:48.694 --> 23:50.161
D.B. Cooper. D.B. Cooper.

23:50.163 --> 23:51.862
Actually, he called himself
Dan Cooper. The media,

23:51.864 --> 23:53.664
for some reason, mistakenly
referred to him as D.B.

23:53.666 --> 23:55.166
This has never been explained.

23:55.168 --> 23:56.734
Nor has what happened next.

23:56.736 --> 23:59.770
Upon receiving a ransom
of $200K, he dons a parachute,

23:59.772 --> 24:01.672
and somewhere north
of Portland, he jumps.

24:01.674 --> 24:03.908
Into a parallel dimension.
We got to go.

24:03.910 --> 24:05.676
Okay, you can't jump
into a multiverse.

24:05.678 --> 24:07.144
You need a gateway or a portal.

24:07.146 --> 24:08.479
I thought you were ignoring him.
Right.

24:08.481 --> 24:09.480
Go ahead.

24:09.482 --> 24:11.082
Where was I?

24:11.083 --> 24:12.683
Uh, a guy was
jumping out an airplane.

24:12.685 --> 24:14.518
Okay. So fast-forward
nine years later. Mm.

24:14.520 --> 24:16.687
A young kid
on a camping trip discovers

24:16.689 --> 24:18.689
three bundles of cash in a sandpit.
Mm-hmm.

24:18.691 --> 24:21.826
Totaling $5,800 with serial
numbers matching the cash

24:21.828 --> 24:23.828
from the hijacking.

24:23.830 --> 24:25.696
This is the only evidence
ever found in the case.

24:25.698 --> 24:26.831
What's the point?

24:26.833 --> 24:27.898
Why didn't you tell me

24:27.900 --> 24:29.600
that we had a copycat
here in Hawaii?

24:29.602 --> 24:31.635
I'm something of
an expert on D.B. Cooper.

24:31.637 --> 24:33.287
I could be of assistance.

24:33.288 --> 24:34.938
I'm sure you are, but
we-we have a suspect.

24:34.941 --> 24:37.708
Right. Authorities always think
they have their man.

24:37.710 --> 24:39.610
No, we're pretty sure
we got our guy.

24:39.612 --> 24:42.213
But how can you really know?

24:42.215 --> 24:44.748
Well, because
when we showed up, uh...

24:44.750 --> 24:48.118
he ran, and we found
a dead DEA agent that he shot.

24:48.120 --> 24:51.121
Okay, that does strongly imply guilt.
Right.

24:51.123 --> 24:53.591
We really appreciate your
enthusiasm, as always,

24:53.593 --> 24:55.726
but the alternate theory
thing is not gonna...

24:55.728 --> 24:58.028
(phone beeping)
It's okay. We got this.

24:58.030 --> 25:00.164
McGarrett.
Roger that.

25:00.166 --> 25:02.566
But if it does turn out to be a copycat...
If we hear anything,

25:02.568 --> 25:04.001
we'll beam it over to you, okay?

25:04.002 --> 25:05.435
Okay, you can't beam a thought.
Hold, hold, hold...

25:05.436 --> 25:06.869
Only matter. And you realize
you're not as funny

25:06.873 --> 25:09.607
as you think you are. He's
right about both counts, uh...

25:09.609 --> 25:11.909
Hey, yeah. Go ahead. DEA
SPECIAL AGENT: Steve.

25:11.911 --> 25:14.778
My guys are reporting a lot of
chatter coming out of Mexico.

25:14.780 --> 25:17.281
Seems Frontera reached out
to his employers

25:17.283 --> 25:19.149
and he's asking for
an extraction off the Island.

25:19.151 --> 25:21.685
Explains the two guys
in the SUV.

25:21.687 --> 25:23.153
(tires screeching)

25:23.155 --> 25:24.989
Yeah, unfortunately,

25:24.990 --> 25:26.824
we can't get a fix
on Frontera's current location.

25:26.826 --> 25:28.959
We don't need that, we just need
the extraction point.

25:28.961 --> 25:31.161
Copy. We'll focus
on getting that to you,

25:31.163 --> 25:33.631
and we'll let you know when
we have something. (beeps)

25:33.633 --> 25:35.933
GROVER:
Gentlemen.

25:35.935 --> 25:38.002
You're gonna want to see this.

25:40.172 --> 25:42.806
So, while processing the place,
CSU found a burner phone.

25:42.808 --> 25:44.308
We had Eric just go through it.

25:44.310 --> 25:46.610
Turns out, Agent
Raine was texting

25:46.612 --> 25:49.847
with somebody about a half
an hour before we showed up.

25:52.818 --> 25:54.285
"He's here."

25:54.287 --> 25:56.120
And this popped up
a few seconds after.

25:59.125 --> 26:01.025
"Don't let him leave."

26:01.027 --> 26:03.594
Raine slept with Frontera
to keep him there.

26:03.596 --> 26:05.563
STEVE: All right,
whoever those guys were,

26:05.565 --> 26:07.731
casing that house, they weren't
there to extract Frontera,

26:07.733 --> 26:08.799
they were there
to kill him, right?

26:20.079 --> 26:21.278
Hey. I got your message.

26:21.280 --> 26:23.013
Thanks for coming.
Yeah. What's going on?

26:23.015 --> 26:25.716
I had Detective Lau's
body exhumed.

26:25.718 --> 26:27.151
What? Why?

26:27.153 --> 26:29.053
Remember how I told you
Lau was investigating

26:29.055 --> 26:31.722
the three pawns our UnSub
used to commit murder?

26:31.724 --> 26:33.691
Yes.
Well, I think that the UnSub

26:33.693 --> 26:35.960
was afraid that Lau would
eventually get onto him

26:35.962 --> 26:38.128
so he took him out
before that could happen.

26:38.130 --> 26:40.931
Wait... Whoa, whoa, wait...

26:40.933 --> 26:43.434
You're trying to tell me...

26:43.435 --> 26:45.936
you think Lau's suicide was staged?
I know it was.

26:45.938 --> 26:47.738
Lau's autopsy proves
that his GSW

26:47.740 --> 26:49.640
was not self-inflicted.

26:49.642 --> 26:51.208
Even if that is the case,
there's nothing

26:51.210 --> 26:53.143
about Lau's death
that fits the M.O.

26:53.145 --> 26:54.812
I mean, there was no chess piece

26:54.814 --> 26:56.180
found with the body, right?
Well, actually,

26:56.182 --> 26:58.232
the chess piece is
the killer's signature,

26:58.233 --> 27:00.283
it's not his M.O. The reason why
he didn't leave a piece behind

27:00.286 --> 27:02.186
is 'cause Lau wasn't part
of the game.

27:02.188 --> 27:05.356
Right. And he wouldn't want us
looking into Lau's death.

27:05.358 --> 27:07.057
That, too.
Okay. All right.

27:07.059 --> 27:10.027
I'm gonna reopen it. But I need
you to tell me something first.

I told them that the
order came from you

27:18.971 --> 27:22.773

documents with your name on it.
