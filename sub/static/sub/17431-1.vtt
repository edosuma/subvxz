WEBVTT

02:54.066 --> 02:55.636
Stay with me.

02:56.295 --> 02:59.342
Lena. Lena.

03:02.751 --> 03:04.484
Those monsters.

03:04.495 --> 03:05.737
Killed her.

03:06.110 --> 03:09.377
Killed her right in front of me.

03:09.378 --> 03:13.245
There's nothing you could have done to save your friend.

03:13.432 --> 03:15.755
Nothing.

03:20.851 --> 03:23.060
What is your name?

03:23.613 --> 03:26.311
I don't even know your name.

03:26.988 --> 03:32.513
Black. Shawn Black.

03:37.205 --> 03:40.168
Tired of this shit!

03:42.495 --> 03:46.178
- What, are they close?
- Not close enough.

03:53.524 --> 03:54.665
No matter what happens,

03:54.766 --> 03:57.542
keep this rig moving.

04:37.318 --> 04:40.067
This war started long before I was around

04:40.068 --> 04:43.219
and it will continue long after I'm gone.

04:43.221 --> 04:45.430
This is good and evil shit,

04:45.431 --> 04:47.886
straight out of the Bible.

04:49.081 --> 04:51.200
It began when the good angels kicked the bad angels

04:51.201 --> 04:53.450
outta heaven, sent them down to Earth

04:53.455 --> 04:55.706
where they would wage war against mankind

04:55.707 --> 04:57.607
until the end of time.

04:57.925 --> 05:00.595
This enemy has been personified in many forms

05:00.596 --> 05:03.418
over righteousness.

05:03.671 --> 05:08.457
I was about to become part of an upside down civilization.

05:08.697 --> 05:11.424
A place I was invited into where my parents were cruelly murdered

05:11.425 --> 05:14.926
by this ruthless enemy.

05:14.989 --> 05:17.702
I was kept alive, and for what reason

05:17.703 --> 05:20.027
I do not know.

05:20.312 --> 05:22.687
I had a brother who was killed where we both

05:22.688 --> 05:25.808
fought in Afghanistan. He was murdered

05:25.809 --> 05:27.844
and his body disappeared.

05:27.845 --> 05:30.844
Before he left this cruel world, he managed to somehow send me,

05:30.845 --> 05:34.378
a fore warrant.

05:34.469 --> 05:36.745
It was a name... and an address.

05:36.746 --> 05:39.347
That would be the beginning of a pursuit

05:39.348 --> 05:42.993
of whom I was to become.

05:46.898 --> 05:49.359
Calm down, Mr.Black. You're in the hospital.

05:49.360 --> 05:51.086
- What hospital?
- You're at Reverton Memorial.

05:51.087 --> 05:55.343
You were brought in late last night. You have to relax.

05:56.311 --> 05:57.809
Where are my clothes?

05:59.838 --> 06:02.444
- You're scaring me.
- Where are my clothes?

06:02.911 --> 06:05.425
In the closet.

06:06.074 --> 06:07.811
The Police were here wanting to talk to you.

06:07.812 --> 06:09.910
- They will be back.
- Get up!

06:10.639 --> 06:14.198
You're in no condition to leave?

06:25.713 --> 06:27.704
Losing your entire family,

06:27.705 --> 06:30.266
takes a hell of a chunk out of you.

06:30.267 --> 06:32.036
I was on my own now

06:32.037 --> 06:34.467
and it was time to man up.

06:41.953 --> 06:43.859
I had to start all over again.

06:43.860 --> 06:45.776
My dad and I loved cars.

06:45.777 --> 06:48.797
And collecting them was our passion.

06:48.798 --> 06:51.430
My poor mother, she never understood it. But hey,

06:51.431 --> 06:53.515
that's mothers.

06:53.516 --> 06:55.318
What're you gonna do?

06:57.579 --> 07:00.070
She was Irish and my father Italian.

07:00.071 --> 07:03.406
With that combination, I didn't know what to do first,

07:03.407 --> 07:05.960
get revenge, or get drunk.

07:05.961 --> 07:08.463
I needed to do both.

07:34.383 --> 07:36.987
Relax, Black.

07:53.103 --> 07:55.730
You know, I'm real sorry about your folks.

07:57.286 --> 07:59.675
Your daddy was a good man.

07:59.776 --> 08:01.627
Your mom, too.

08:01.751 --> 08:03.754
You know,

08:05.843 --> 08:09.059
I went to high school with her.

08:09.824 --> 08:12.195
Lena. Y'know?

08:23.668 --> 08:25.668
Whoa!

08:25.693 --> 08:28.998
Look at that car!

08:29.447 --> 08:32.576
That's some car!

08:43.296 --> 08:45.571
What do you think of that car, Detective Williams?

08:45.572 --> 08:48.320
What I think, I'm not gonna eat Mexican again.

08:48.321 --> 08:51.961
- We had it yesterday.
- Yessiree, boy.

08:52.383 --> 08:56.219
But hell, life can't always be about bellies and T's. Can it?

08:56.220 --> 08:59.150
I'll see you in the car.

09:02.478 --> 09:04.967
That's my father's car.

09:05.727 --> 09:08.397
He waited a long time for it.

09:08.462 --> 09:11.458
Never got a chance to drive it.

09:11.913 --> 09:13.874
That's a shame.

09:18.212 --> 09:20.569
I think when you enlisted, though...

09:21.366 --> 09:23.459
I mean, hell.

09:24.666 --> 09:28.526
Your daddy worried his ass off the whole time you were in Afghanistan.

09:28.621 --> 09:31.375
I mean, your brother turning up MIA, that was tough, wasn't it?

09:32.106 --> 09:34.790
And having the both of you gone like that though.

09:35.899 --> 09:38.438
He was kind of just left here...

09:39.135 --> 09:41.647
counting his days.

09:41.849 --> 09:44.343
Just counting the days.

09:47.521 --> 09:50.646
You know, there's an official way of things here, Black.

09:51.146 --> 09:53.742
And then there's the good old way.

09:53.766 --> 09:55.766
And me, I prefer the good old way.

09:56.013 --> 09:58.785
As long as the good citizens of Riverton here, don't get hurt.

09:58.787 --> 10:01.372
And that little nurse,

10:01.373 --> 10:04.196
she's one of the good ones. Understand?

10:04.197 --> 10:06.598
- Message heard.
- Good. Because I just think there's some things

10:06.599 --> 10:09.223
in this here world, Black, they're never talked about, you know.

10:09.224 --> 10:11.824
But those things,

10:14.217 --> 10:17.553
they can kill you.

10:30.648 --> 10:32.148
Cops.

10:32.149 --> 10:34.047
They might be necessary,

10:34.048 --> 10:35.801
but I trusted that clown,

10:35.802 --> 10:39.072
the baddest boys he can throw at me.

10:40.485 --> 10:43.124
I always believe, if you need something done,

10:43.125 --> 10:46.236
you just gotta take care of it yourself.

10:49.690 --> 10:53.164
Otherwise, it always turns out the same,

10:53.165 --> 10:57.848
too many chiefs, and not enough Indians.

11:29.526 --> 11:31.533
I still had no clue what happened to my brother

11:31.534 --> 11:33.546
when we were in battle,

11:33.547 --> 11:36.126
and that was very unsettling.

11:36.127 --> 11:38.995
The lead he sent me, and the lighter which was used

11:38.997 --> 11:41.167
to decimate my parent's bodies...

11:41.169 --> 11:44.678
was what I had to go on.

11:57.878 --> 12:00.500
How do you know if this Tagg character is a hostile

12:00.501 --> 12:02.437
or a friendly?

12:02.438 --> 12:06.178
But I was going in heavy to find out.

12:22.802 --> 12:25.404
- Can I help you, sir?
- Is Tagg around?

12:25.405 --> 12:29.150
Tagg? Tagg who? What kind of name is that?

12:29.151 --> 12:31.992
Is Tagg around?

12:32.654 --> 12:34.555
Are you fucking with me, boy?

12:34.556 --> 12:37.177
I said there's nobody here named Tagg.

12:37.178 --> 12:38.860
If I was you, I'd get my fucking ass out of here,

12:38.861 --> 12:41.857
right now.

12:48.957 --> 12:50.993
Are you kidding me?

12:51.527 --> 12:53.616
What are you gonna do with this?

13:01.896 --> 13:04.176
You're fucked now, boy.

13:12.394 --> 13:14.863
Pound that fucker.

13:15.494 --> 13:17.158
Kick him again. That's it!

13:17.159 --> 13:20.300
Hit him! Hit him! Hit him!

13:20.301 --> 13:21.491
Kick him!

13:22.611 --> 13:25.389
Hit him! Hit him! Hit him!

13:25.390 --> 13:28.038
Enough!

13:42.810 --> 13:45.318
Slayer!

14:03.817 --> 14:06.185
I smell a slayer, Tagg.

14:09.272 --> 14:12.622
Is this... the evil magic you been up to?

14:31.796 --> 14:33.337
Hit that bitch.

14:33.947 --> 14:36.426
Shoot that, bitch! Cut me loose.

14:36.492 --> 14:38.352
What the hell is going on?

14:38.353 --> 14:39.587
We don't have much time.

14:39.588 --> 14:41.868
Get me out of this thing.

14:48.836 --> 14:50.379
Shot gun.

14:50.380 --> 14:51.582
Shot gun!

14:54.528 --> 14:56.098
Fucking things are worse than termites.

14:56.099 --> 14:58.569
- Who are you?
- Tagg.

14:59.466 --> 15:02.158
Came in the nick of time.

15:02.277 --> 15:05.140
Don't worry about those guys there. They're just meth heads.

15:05.802 --> 15:07.428
That crazy bitch,

15:10.521 --> 15:12.619
that's my old lady.

15:12.620 --> 15:14.317
I tried to warn her.

15:14.318 --> 15:16.627
She want to know too much.

15:16.628 --> 15:17.863
She want to know everything.

15:17.864 --> 15:20.249
She want to... find out.

15:22.587 --> 15:24.666
I guess she found out.

15:27.307 --> 15:30.352
Man, there's a whole world that people don't even know exists.

15:30.353 --> 15:34.799
Thinks that... can't be explained.

15:36.773 --> 15:38.931
Like this?

15:40.989 --> 15:43.833
Exactly.

15:45.537 --> 15:47.536
What was that thing down there?

15:47.537 --> 15:48.804
Vampire.

15:48.805 --> 15:51.429
Most people think of vampires, they think of...

15:51.430 --> 15:54.439
Brad Pitt chasing Tom Cruise around in tights.

15:54.440 --> 15:56.480
Clearly not the case.

15:56.720 --> 15:58.919
Things are parasites.

15:59.048 --> 16:01.396
They hunt alone,

16:01.397 --> 16:04.527
tend to hunt people that are by themselves.

16:04.790 --> 16:07.810
Homeless people, wanderers.

16:07.811 --> 16:10.417
People at the wrong place at the wrong time.

16:13.830 --> 16:18.018
But every... 100... 200 years...

16:19.866 --> 16:21.490
a king is born.

16:21.491 --> 16:24.758
Hatched from the soul of a dying warrior, killed in battle.

16:25.278 --> 16:30.353
The beast... rises to lead an army of vampires.

16:30.354 --> 16:32.727
That's when shit hits the fan.

16:33.517 --> 16:38.911
The army's sole intention... is to consume and destroy mankind.

16:41.437 --> 16:44.245
They ain't called the Black Plague for nothing.

16:44.700 --> 16:47.849
This king, name is Cain.

16:47.932 --> 16:51.054
He's out of Afghanistan.

16:51.421 --> 16:55.783
He's here to ensure an evil kingdom of vampires.

16:57.565 --> 16:59.769
In order to succeed in this quest,

16:59.770 --> 17:03.232
Cain must eliminate the one thing that stands in his way.

17:03.233 --> 17:04.512
The slayer.

17:07.152 --> 17:08.439
Slayer?

17:08.917 --> 17:10.424
What are you talking about?

17:10.425 --> 17:11.968
Oh, get this.

17:12.771 --> 17:14.644
He knows that you are the slayer.

17:17.551 --> 17:19.580
Vampire slayer.

17:20.373 --> 17:21.425
Stop the crazy talk.

17:21.696 --> 17:24.064
I'm just looking for the son of a bitch...

17:24.065 --> 17:25.383
that murdered my brother.

17:25.439 --> 17:30.045
Well, that son of a bitch, is in the low country.

17:30.046 --> 17:32.834
I have a friend down there, Father Roy.

17:32.871 --> 17:35.255
He'll help you out.

17:39.410 --> 17:41.410
Oh...

17:42.966 --> 17:44.532
Might want to take these.

17:46.677 --> 17:50.564
- What's so special about these?
- Silver.

17:50.801 --> 17:54.076
Slimy bastards hate silver.

18:00.057 --> 18:02.587
I've seen in a couple of few scumbags eat shit,

18:02.588 --> 18:06.914
might shock a guy. Not me, not anymore.

18:06.915 --> 18:08.899
I'm pretty good at reading people

18:08.900 --> 18:11.016
and Tagg seemed like a legitimate guy.

18:11.017 --> 18:12.921
He called me a vampire slayer

18:12.923 --> 18:15.560
and although I'm not too sure
what the fuck he's talking about,

18:15.561 --> 18:17.041
I am a soldier,

18:17.042 --> 18:19.162
and in a slaying kind of mood.

18:19.385 --> 18:22.606
So, however high I gotta stack them, so be it.

19:22.429 --> 19:26.413
He knows, you're coming.

19:48.433 --> 19:50.498
I have to go so bad.

19:50.499 --> 19:53.411
Holy crap, is that a Shelby? Tight!

19:54.917 --> 19:57.595
- Is it a Super Snake?
- Yeah.

19:58.396 --> 20:00.298
Hi.

20:00.453 --> 20:02.703
- Lena, I have to pee.
- Go.

20:02.704 --> 20:04.766
I don't wanna pee by myself.

20:04.767 --> 20:07.003
You're the one that has to go.

20:07.004 --> 20:10.084
God, you are such a bitch.

20:10.610 --> 20:13.528
What are you doing driving a Super Snake?

20:13.529 --> 20:15.438
You know, they only making a 1,000 of them.

20:15.439 --> 20:17.664
I know.

20:17.665 --> 20:20.495
- Your name is Lena?
- Yeah.

20:20.497 --> 20:23.297
How did you get your hands on one of these things?

20:23.298 --> 20:25.885
I heard it was impossible to get on the list.

20:25.886 --> 20:28.325
It was tough.

20:28.327 --> 20:31.621
My brother, he would absolutely shit...

20:41.820 --> 20:43.483
Jenny, you okay?

20:43.484 --> 20:46.058
The fucking sink squirted water all over me.

20:46.059 --> 20:49.235
Oh, my God. You're such an idiot.

20:50.192 --> 20:52.988
Why does he have a gun, Lena?

20:55.762 --> 20:58.998
Lena, let's just get hell out of here.

21:11.025 --> 21:14.983
Lena, let's go. This whole thing is scaring me.

22:14.632 --> 22:17.236
Do not deny me, my brother.

22:17.237 --> 22:20.129
I'm here with your reward for helping the slayer.

22:20.130 --> 22:22.316
But I got something for you, too.

22:22.317 --> 22:25.319
Good old fashion ass kicking.

22:42.126 --> 22:43.426
Don't worry.

22:43.627 --> 22:46.789
I'll make you divine.

23:48.158 --> 23:49.778
Black River city.

23:49.779 --> 23:52.616
The heart of the low country.

23:52.873 --> 23:56.966
Looks like a hell of a good place for showdown to me.

24:04.402 --> 24:07.034
Don't know what the fuck you're talking about.

24:07.035 --> 24:09.529
Connie Stuart. She's just down the hall from me

24:09.530 --> 24:11.974
at the dorm. She told me about club Mortem.

24:11.975 --> 24:14.144
She said to come here, to the Purple Eye

24:14.145 --> 24:16.778
and someone might be able to bring us some passes.

24:17.857 --> 24:21.865
- Jenny, let's go.
- No. I'm not gonna miss out on this partying.

24:21.866 --> 24:24.229
Club Mortem is the hottest club ever, Lena.

24:24.230 --> 24:26.382
I'm not gonna miss my chance to go.

24:26.383 --> 24:28.352
The day that bitch, Connie Stuart, get used to go and

24:28.353 --> 24:31.670
I don't. Cold day in hell.

24:31.671 --> 24:34.171
You're Johnny, right?

24:41.786 --> 24:44.036
- Please.
- Jenny.

24:44.037 --> 24:47.927
- I want to smell your panties.
- Whoa, take it easy, tiger.

24:47.928 --> 24:51.538
Sick freak. Jenny, Are you sure you wanna do this?

25:04.433 --> 25:07.056
- Pin head?
- Yeah.

25:07.057 --> 25:10.381
Are you ladies looking for deliverance?

25:23.795 --> 25:26.441
Let's get the fuck out of here.

25:35.324 --> 25:40.168
Next stop, Tagg's friend. Father Roy.

25:40.169 --> 25:42.669
Talk about putting parishioners to sleep.

25:42.670 --> 25:45.594
Seems like this guy's entire congregation,

25:45.595 --> 25:48.426
was resting in peace.

26:18.255 --> 26:20.200
Shit!

26:20.201 --> 26:22.428
- Nice going, baldy.
- My name is Black.

26:22.429 --> 26:25.305
- I lost.
- You done playing games?

26:25.306 --> 26:28.209
I'm looking for Father Roy.

26:29.030 --> 26:31.758
Well, if he owes you money,

26:31.759 --> 26:34.677
You'd have better luck getting it from one of these daisy pushers.

26:34.678 --> 26:37.656
That's great. You know where he is?

26:53.533 --> 26:56.548
Dude. A guy name Black's here.

26:56.549 --> 26:59.104
This is Father Roy?

26:59.105 --> 27:00.193
Dude.

27:01.426 --> 27:02.503
Dude.

27:03.713 --> 27:06.783
Totally busted. You're not snoozing.

27:28.840 --> 27:30.639
My glasses.

27:56.167 --> 27:59.122
- You got a car?
- Yeah.

27:59.684 --> 28:03.494
- What is it?
- Shelby.

28:05.016 --> 28:08.189
Doesn't get much better than that, does it?

28:08.585 --> 28:10.866
Oh, shit.

28:13.505 --> 28:15.356
Where you going?

28:16.922 --> 28:21.187
Time for breakfast. You're buying.

28:21.410 --> 28:24.830
Hey, Crash. Keep an eye on the fort, ok?

28:24.831 --> 28:25.874
You got it.

28:36.145 --> 28:38.145
Good eats.

28:38.770 --> 28:41.784
- You're picking up the check, right?
- Yeah, I got it.

28:43.092 --> 28:45.444
Fine.

28:45.445 --> 28:46.745
Hey, honey. Hey, come here.

28:47.409 --> 28:49.525
What you need?

28:49.526 --> 28:50.905
Everything looks really good, but,

28:50.906 --> 28:53.573
Can I get some jam?

28:53.574 --> 28:54.616
Hold on a second.

28:54.617 --> 28:58.040
Peach jam. Yeah, peach jam.

28:59.683 --> 29:03.641
- Man, she's got a nice ass.
- I heard that Father.

29:05.781 --> 29:07.732
I guess right about now, you're starting

29:07.733 --> 29:09.152
to wonder how come I haven't asked

29:09.153 --> 29:10.616
you what're you doing here, right?

29:10.617 --> 29:12.819
- Crossed my mind.
- Listen.

29:12.820 --> 29:15.768
Being a man of the cloth and all that,

29:15.769 --> 29:19.300
I kind of, get to know people pretty good.

29:19.301 --> 29:21.987
You don't strike me as, the type of guy, to

29:22.322 --> 29:25.414
buy holy water...

29:25.415 --> 29:31.104
or... solicit me for a divine plant,

29:32.581 --> 29:36.051
which is nothing more than a weed.

29:36.391 --> 29:39.454
You also don't seem like the kind of a sucker

29:39.455 --> 29:41.335
to buy a bobble headed Jesus,

29:41.337 --> 29:45.768
with little red tears falling down his face, in food coloring.

29:48.880 --> 29:50.682
In fact, what I do think,

29:50.683 --> 29:54.110
is that you're the kind of guy who only shows up...

29:54.404 --> 29:57.319
when the shit is about to hit the fan.

29:57.321 --> 29:59.506
The kind of guy who's gonna show up, and when he does, the

29:59.507 --> 30:01.006
body counts gonna go up.

30:01.062 --> 30:04.419
That's the kind of thing that I wanna stay the fuck away from.

30:04.420 --> 30:07.210
So, I really appreciate all the grub.

30:07.211 --> 30:09.480
A very nice gesture on your part...

30:09.481 --> 30:12.079
but I'm gonna eat it, by myself.

30:12.080 --> 30:14.935
And our business is over.

30:17.629 --> 30:22.357
Before I go... chomp on this.

30:23.957 --> 30:26.045
I'm chomping on this.

30:26.046 --> 30:28.249
Try that.

30:36.138 --> 30:40.219
Everything is telling me, not to pick up that piece of paper.

30:48.615 --> 30:53.214
Curiosity has always been one of my downfalls.

30:53.215 --> 30:56.237
<i>Father Roy - Black is a vampire killer...</i>

30:56.238 --> 30:58.554
<i>A slayer! It's in his blood. The time is right</i>

30:58.556 --> 31:01.860
<i>to kill Cain. - Tagg.</i>

31:05.483 --> 31:08.848
- Time to "vamanos".
- Don't you wanna finish your breakfast?

31:09.084 --> 31:11.084
Uh-hmm.

31:11.609 --> 31:14.676
Lost my appetite.

31:14.712 --> 31:17.491
Can I get a check, please? Give it to him.

31:51.554 --> 31:53.292
Walk or die, priest.

32:15.962 --> 32:17.424
Beat it, mime.

32:17.845 --> 32:19.083
Fuck you.

32:35.407 --> 32:37.799
Get outta the away.

32:41.152 --> 32:42.730
Where you going? Where you going?

32:43.148 --> 32:45.851
How cool is this club Mortem right down here.

32:46.164 --> 32:48.604
Gee, I don't know. I think we should head back.

32:49.179 --> 32:51.045
I'm telling you, this place give me bad vibes.

32:51.047 --> 32:54.200
There's perverts in Memphis, too. It is pervs everywhere.

32:54.201 --> 32:56.663
Let's just get the car and go to the party.

32:56.664 --> 32:59.606
I mean, priest and the hooker?

32:59.707 --> 33:02.770
I love this place. It's crazy.

33:12.516 --> 33:13.896
Come on. Move.

33:28.762 --> 33:33.143
I guess Cain must be quaking in his boots right about now.

33:33.561 --> 33:37.443
Quiet priest. Your mighty slayer is dead by now.

33:37.624 --> 33:38.930
Oh, maybe not.

33:38.931 --> 33:40.480
Lights out, freaks!

34:12.001 --> 34:14.031
Oh, shit. Ain't that the guy we met in the road?

34:15.603 --> 34:17.750
- The one with the gun?
- Yeah, that guy.

34:19.641 --> 34:22.958
I got a bad feeling about this. Come on.

34:22.958 --> 34:24.002
Come on.

34:38.601 --> 34:41.132
Trust me when I tell you. All them vamps are bunch of fucking

34:41.134 --> 34:44.166
wannabees. I've seen their kind before.

34:44.167 --> 34:45.981
They usually dress up in all kinds of weird,

34:45.982 --> 34:48.666
freaky costumes.

34:48.777 --> 34:51.078
What are you doing?

34:51.482 --> 34:53.411
We need firepower.

34:54.976 --> 34:56.851
When the day of evil comes,

34:56.853 --> 34:58.670
you will stand your ground,

34:58.672 --> 35:01.730
but you're gonna need more firepower than that.

35:03.739 --> 35:06.107
It's in the Bible.

35:06.108 --> 35:08.842
Some place. Heh, heh.

35:09.260 --> 35:10.713
Let me tell you I've been waiting a long time

35:10.714 --> 35:12.729
for you to get here.

35:13.697 --> 35:16.320
That's the war wagon.

35:16.321 --> 35:18.811
Look at that fucking thing. Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

35:19.044 --> 35:21.533
It's bullet proof.

35:26.000 --> 35:27.982
You being here means one thing

35:27.983 --> 35:30.827
Cain and all of his pals are getting ready to swarm.

35:30.828 --> 35:31.771
Swarm?

35:31.772 --> 35:33.491
Yeah, like a bunch of hornets.

35:33.492 --> 35:35.523
Taking breeders making new vampires.

35:35.524 --> 35:38.479
Inviting the good looking ones to their evil little party.

35:39.351 --> 35:42.486
Bet your bottom dollar that party is gonna be tonight.

35:46.970 --> 35:50.615
This, my humble friend... is firepower.

35:58.706 --> 36:00.618
All these weapons have been blessed.

36:00.619 --> 36:05.023
The guns, the ammo, the explosives.

36:05.024 --> 36:07.180
Everything.

36:07.181 --> 36:10.178
It's a vampire's worst nightmare.

36:10.371 --> 36:14.187
I'll give you a crash course on these coffin dwellers.

36:14.331 --> 36:16.315
Forget all that crap you hear about them,

36:16.316 --> 36:18.584
not being able to move around during the daytime.

36:18.585 --> 36:20.125
They're a little weak, but they're still

36:20.127 --> 36:22.914
as dangerous as a rattlesnake. So, don't get cocky.

36:22.915 --> 36:27.028
Garlic is good, but I don't like to get that close.

36:27.605 --> 36:30.011
I prefer a blessed hollow point,

36:30.012 --> 36:31.055
right through the heart.

36:31.056 --> 36:34.920
Crash, he likes head shots. Don't you, Crash? Ha, ha, ha.

36:35.309 --> 36:38.141
All we gotta do is find the hive and the coffins.

36:38.142 --> 36:40.525
They can't survive for long without their coffins.

36:40.526 --> 36:44.602
We take them all out, we get the whole cell.

36:45.878 --> 36:47.273
Thompson.

36:47.713 --> 36:49.939
My weapon of choice.

36:49.940 --> 36:52.524
Take your pick.

36:59.678 --> 37:01.497
Listen, I gotta tell you about something

37:01.498 --> 37:04.465
and you're probably not gonna like it very much.

37:07.208 --> 37:10.291
You're the only one that can kill Cain.

37:10.520 --> 37:12.774
Why me?

37:13.071 --> 37:15.843
Because he was your brother.

37:17.049 --> 37:19.945
My brother's been missing for five years.

37:20.037 --> 37:23.563
The man you knew as your brother is dead.

37:24.838 --> 37:27.627
Whether you like it or not.

37:27.628 --> 37:30.209
What he is now is an altogether different thing.

37:30.210 --> 37:31.667
He's an animal.

37:31.669 --> 37:33.987
I know we've been trained to kill,

37:34.231 --> 37:35.952
but there's no way in hell,

37:35.953 --> 37:38.778
he'd ever murder, like that monster.

37:38.879 --> 37:41.577
Cain is not my brother.

37:41.578 --> 37:44.413
He was your brother, that makes you the slayer!

37:44.414 --> 37:46.524
You're the only one that can kill him!

37:46.525 --> 37:48.379
You gotta do it, you gotta stop him!

37:48.380 --> 37:52.008
You got the same blood! You got the king's blood!

37:52.009 --> 37:53.820
Nobody can kill him except you!

37:53.821 --> 37:56.539
You and only you, whether you like it or not!

38:01.422 --> 38:04.589
I've had enough of this madness.

38:10.861 --> 38:13.558
We're screwed now, bro.

38:15.211 --> 38:18.577
I'm optimistic. Okay?

38:18.956 --> 38:23.682
Get the C4. Every single bit of it.

38:23.795 --> 38:26.009
If Black doesn't kill that bastard...

38:26.010 --> 38:30.245
we're gonna blow that place to kingdom come.

39:55.396 --> 39:57.728
He looks ready, Crash.

39:57.729 --> 40:00.064
Get the sword.

40:23.295 --> 40:26.235
I'm sure your brother was a fine man.

40:26.372 --> 40:28.260
He was.

40:29.659 --> 40:33.660
You know, God only asks for help from those who can give it.

40:33.662 --> 40:35.565
I'm ready.

40:36.659 --> 40:38.566
Yeah, I think you are.

40:38.567 --> 40:41.051
The sword of Dhamphir.

40:41.052 --> 40:44.279
You gonna need that to finish off Cain.

40:44.953 --> 40:48.443
That fucking thing will scare the shit out of him.

40:51.798 --> 40:54.275
We got enough C4 to blow that place to hell.

40:54.277 --> 40:57.560
Trouble is, I'll need some better information on the location.

40:58.066 --> 41:00.565
- Who would know?
- One of the sickest, weirdest

41:00.566 --> 41:03.003
fuckers I know.

41:03.004 --> 41:06.293
Calls himself Johnny the Perv.

41:06.445 --> 41:10.570
I don't know, what the fuck you're talking about, man.

41:11.599 --> 41:13.497
Oh, man. Man!

41:19.667 --> 41:23.309
- Tell us.
- Cain... will kill me.

41:24.391 --> 41:26.703
Go ahead.

41:29.404 --> 41:31.937
Tell us... or I'll kill you.

41:36.774 --> 41:39.310
Club Mortem.

41:40.066 --> 41:42.495
The old Vextel factory.

41:42.496 --> 41:44.751
Shoulda guessed that.

41:45.152 --> 41:48.417
It's the perfect place for Cain and all of his pals to hang out.

41:48.480 --> 41:51.975
It's probably where they're gonna deliver the coffins.

41:58.485 --> 42:01.165
Okay. This is Vextel.

42:01.366 --> 42:03.301
Best way in is through the swamp.

42:03.302 --> 42:04.699
In the back.

42:04.800 --> 42:06.525
Cut through here...

42:06.526 --> 42:08.736
Cain will never even see us coming.

42:08.737 --> 42:10.695
There's the entrance to the club.

42:13.703 --> 42:15.056
Right there.

42:16.943 --> 42:18.436
Couple of years ago,

42:18.437 --> 42:22.620
back in 1982, 800 employees of Vextel,

42:23.416 --> 42:26.373
gassed to death, by what was supposed to be

42:26.374 --> 42:30.573
a non lethal gas. This case it killed everybody.

42:30.574 --> 42:32.898
The government completely covered it up.

42:32.899 --> 42:36.077
Never even made the fucking papers.

42:36.178 --> 42:39.529
If Cain was gonna pick a place to have a club,

42:39.531 --> 42:43.243
an evil place, well, by God, he did.

42:43.280 --> 42:45.239
Right here.

42:47.467 --> 42:49.130
Listen.

42:50.075 --> 42:52.284
We're gonna miss Wheel of Fortune,

42:52.285 --> 42:54.802
we don't get this show on the road.

42:55.566 --> 42:57.726
You're not going.

42:57.727 --> 43:00.074
Neither is the kid.

43:00.075 --> 43:01.287
Why not?

43:01.288 --> 43:03.136
You've done your job.

43:03.137 --> 43:05.321
You've blessed the weapons.

43:05.322 --> 43:09.508
- You sure?
- If I'm the only one who can kill Cain...

43:11.845 --> 43:14.035
I'm the only one who should risk dying.

43:14.036 --> 43:16.280
- This is a suicide mission, dude.
- Yeah...

43:16.281 --> 43:18.819
- be a way to put it.
- I like my odds.

43:20.676 --> 43:24.056
Alright, then. Let me send you off with a blessing.

43:32.800 --> 43:34.450
Good luck.

43:45.928 --> 43:47.698
I don't know how my brother transformed

43:47.735 --> 43:51.738
into this pure evil king, but if he is in fact evil,

43:51.775 --> 43:55.969
fuck him. He ain't my brother no more.

44:16.363 --> 44:18.434
He must have known his perdition,

44:18.435 --> 44:20.982
which is why he put me on this quest.

44:20.983 --> 44:23.090
So for my brother's sake,

44:23.091 --> 44:26.861
I'll put an end to what he's become.

46:15.721 --> 46:18.726
Oh, my God. It's Club Mortem, it's right there. It's right there. I know.

46:18.727 --> 46:21.305
Oh, my God. This is gonna be so awesome,

46:21.306 --> 46:24.040
- I've been waiting for this for so...
- Jenny.  Calm down.

46:24.101 --> 46:26.388
- Listen to me.
- Ow, you suck!

46:26.425 --> 46:29.385
- Alright, when we get in there just stay close, okay?
- Okay!

46:34.358 --> 46:37.406
Oh, my God. Pull up. Pull up.

46:37.594 --> 46:41.695
Can you hold my phone? Okay!

46:50.007 --> 46:53.285
Just had the coin things a second ago.

46:56.052 --> 46:58.058
Good evening, ladies.

46:58.059 --> 47:01.225
How are you doing? Welcome to our club.

47:12.230 --> 47:15.351
I have a bad feeling about this.

47:34.213 --> 47:36.727
What the fuck?

47:41.875 --> 47:44.085
That was great.

48:10.347 --> 48:12.752
- Girl, you didn't even check...
- Oh, my God.

48:46.923 --> 48:48.885
Cutting up bodies with a meat cleaver?

48:48.886 --> 48:52.305
Was foul as fuck. And looking at this guy's face

48:52.306 --> 48:55.175
was even worse.

48:58.328 --> 49:00.545
Why so sad?

49:00.546 --> 49:04.271
Your death brings me life.

49:31.740 --> 49:35.030
Cain wants them done tonight.

49:38.586 --> 49:41.397
We must be ready to move.

49:56.563 --> 49:58.644
Water?

50:03.760 --> 50:06.457
Where's your date, sweety?

50:06.458 --> 50:10.011
- Thank you.
- I'm your date now, baby.

50:10.507 --> 50:15.311
- Yummy. Yummy, baby. You smell good. Hot! Hot, man. 
- Hot. Yeah...

51:26.426 --> 51:29.400
I got you. I got you. It's over now.

53:56.316 --> 53:58.283
- Head to the woods. Go north.
- No.

53:58.284 --> 54:01.678
- Come with us, please. They'll kill you.
- No.

54:01.679 --> 54:04.180
This ends tonight.

54:08.120 --> 54:10.740
Go.

54:41.967 --> 54:44.709
There.

55:06.039 --> 55:10.102
So, you came for deliverance?

55:12.746 --> 55:14.160
Deliverance.

55:16.910 --> 55:20.141
- Once you enter, you're mine...
- Don't touch me.

55:24.095 --> 55:26.184
I'll do more than touch you, my sweet child.

55:44.751 --> 55:47.890
Looks like Father Roy knew what he was talking about.

55:47.891 --> 55:52.099
There's coffins all over this ungodly fucking place.

56:05.147 --> 56:08.951
- Sweet child.
- Let go of me!

57:11.466 --> 57:15.841
Deliverance.

57:45.022 --> 57:46.989
Lena!

57:47.013 --> 57:49.013
Lena!

57:49.509 --> 57:52.925
No! No! No!

57:52.926 --> 57:55.765
No

58:00.211 --> 58:02.694
No!

58:03.409 --> 58:05.454
No!

58:08.480 --> 58:10.480
Jenny!

58:12.249 --> 58:14.853
Jenny!

58:19.297 --> 58:22.758
Come on, Jenny!

58:24.782 --> 58:26.232
Slayer!

59:02.215 --> 59:04.837
- Welcome my brother.
- My brother's dead.

59:04.838 --> 59:07.320
Soon you will be, too.

59:07.321 --> 59:09.923
I'm not too sure about that.

59:10.486 --> 59:13.324
Ah, she...

59:14.071 --> 59:17.452
She... was to be divine.

59:17.487 --> 59:19.644
This is between us.

59:20.112 --> 59:22.263
What kind of king would rule,

59:22.264 --> 59:25.394
if he wasn't willing to die for his kingdom?

59:36.356 --> 59:38.210
Now,

59:38.508 --> 59:41.340
I may die here tonight,

59:43.089 --> 59:44.934
but the kingdom will rule.

01:00:00.842 --> 01:00:03.139
Let's go.

01:00:17.401 --> 01:00:19.466
Black! No!

01:00:19.467 --> 01:00:23.309
Think we're gonna let you have all the fun?

01:00:24.398 --> 01:00:27.217
Get the coffins first. He's getting away.

01:00:27.218 --> 01:00:29.453
He'll be easier to catch without an army.

01:00:29.454 --> 01:00:31.520
Watch your back.

01:00:31.521 --> 01:00:33.450
Go!

01:00:36.672 --> 01:00:39.348
Come on. We have to go.

01:00:42.664 --> 01:00:45.209
Come on!

01:01:44.963 --> 01:01:46.947
Get down!

01:01:50.371 --> 01:01:52.425
- It's okay.
- Oh, my God. Oh, my...

01:01:52.426 --> 01:01:53.669
- We have to go.
- I can't handle it.

01:01:53.670 --> 01:01:55.978
- You can.
- I can't! I cannot handle it!

01:01:55.979 --> 01:01:59.708
Lena!  You can do this. But we have to do it together.

01:02:00.048 --> 01:02:00.991
Alright.

01:02:00.992 --> 01:02:02.733
Let's go.

01:02:08.665 --> 01:02:10.678
Hey, priest.

01:02:26.064 --> 01:02:27.930
Get back.

01:02:57.221 --> 01:02:59.701
- They're after the coffins.
- Go.

01:03:03.850 --> 01:03:07.560
- I want the priest dead.
- Yes, master.

01:03:19.850 --> 01:03:21.812
Head for the truck.

01:03:24.972 --> 01:03:26.624
I think they're pissed.

01:03:28.612 --> 01:03:31.074
Take this.

01:03:43.723 --> 01:03:46.500
Die, priest.

01:03:58.922 --> 01:04:02.031
- You know anything about shotguns?
- Yeah.

01:04:02.410 --> 01:04:04.350
- Load it.
- Okay.

01:04:21.774 --> 01:04:23.297
You're hurt?

01:04:45.264 --> 01:04:48.598
- Have you set the charges?
- Yeah.

01:04:48.599 --> 01:04:50.882
It's gonna be gnarly.

01:04:51.726 --> 01:04:53.111
I'm finished.

01:04:53.112 --> 01:04:56.927
- Come on.  It's time to go.
- I'm fucking finished.

01:04:56.928 --> 01:04:59.723
Ah, give me cigarette.

01:05:22.013 --> 01:05:24.438
This was supposed to be fun.

01:05:28.629 --> 01:05:30.115
Fuck.

01:05:30.116 --> 01:05:32.395
Stay with me.

01:05:35.751 --> 01:05:38.090
Those monsters.

01:05:38.091 --> 01:05:39.134
Killed her.

01:05:39.587 --> 01:05:42.584
Killed her right in front of me.

01:05:42.608 --> 01:05:46.578
There's nothing you could have done to save your friend.

01:05:48.095 --> 01:05:50.574
Nothing.

01:05:51.848 --> 01:05:54.427
You'd better get outta here.

01:05:54.428 --> 01:05:56.628
You better save yourself while you can.

01:05:56.629 --> 01:06:00.495
You stay... I stay.

01:06:03.599 --> 01:06:06.017
God be with you.

01:06:21.033 --> 01:06:23.351
What is your name?

01:06:24.019 --> 01:06:27.550
I don't even know your name.

01:06:27.853 --> 01:06:33.200
Black. Shawn Black.

01:06:36.622 --> 01:06:39.819
Tired of this, shit.

01:06:42.871 --> 01:06:46.912
- What, are they close?
- Not close enough.

01:07:05.021 --> 01:07:08.367
I want him dead. I want him dead!

01:07:23.173 --> 01:07:24.670
Suck on this.

01:07:46.173 --> 01:07:48.618
- Grab the wheel.
- What?

01:07:48.619 --> 01:07:52.802
- Grab the goddamn wheel. Suit yourself.
- Screw it.

01:07:54.487 --> 01:07:57.366
No matter what happens, keep this rig moving.

01:08:25.800 --> 01:08:27.800
Eat this!

01:10:21.609 --> 01:10:24.488
Bring it on, motherfuckers!

01:11:04.374 --> 01:11:06.348
Hey, Cain.

01:12:39.947 --> 01:12:42.914
For the blood of kings to run through my veins,

01:12:42.915 --> 01:12:45.203
you must die, my brother.

01:12:45.204 --> 01:12:47.820
The only blood that's gonna run tonight is yours.

01:13:07.940 --> 01:13:10.682
You're too weak to fight, brother.

01:13:40.460 --> 01:13:42.757
Die, brother.

01:14:08.884 --> 01:14:12.678
Tonight we fight on your terms, my brother.

01:14:14.066 --> 01:14:19.185
But the morning comes... and with it, my death.

01:14:19.688 --> 01:14:24.951
When we meet again, it will be on my terms.

01:14:24.986 --> 01:14:28.005
My brother died on the battlefield, with honor.

01:15:18.361 --> 01:15:20.811
The only way to deal with a night like last night,

01:15:20.813 --> 01:15:23.548
was to try not to deal with it at all.

01:15:23.549 --> 01:15:26.527
But then again, who am I kidding.

01:15:26.797 --> 01:15:29.282
My destination was set.

01:15:29.283 --> 01:15:31.282
Set on the path of righteousness.

01:15:31.283 --> 01:15:33.238
Scripture says,

01:15:33.239 --> 01:15:35.599
there is a time to pick up the sword.

01:15:35.600 --> 01:15:37.673
Well, I've picked up mine.

01:15:37.674 --> 01:15:41.144
And I will defend, where evil reigns.
