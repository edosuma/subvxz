WEBVTT

00:16.280 --> 00:18.408
Cumbernauld '55.

00:29.920 --> 00:31.640
I believe you were staring at me.

00:32.800 --> 00:33.801
Was I?

00:36.160 --> 00:37.286
Kian.

00:38.320 --> 00:39.401
Ava.

00:45.720 --> 00:48.166
So...
Are you going to keep staring...

00:48.400 --> 00:50.209
...or are you buying me a drink?

01:14.160 --> 01:16.367
- Keys. Right pocket.
- Where?

01:48.440 --> 01:51.649
- I've told you everything I know.
- You've given me pieces.

01:51.880 --> 01:55.646
You've helped around the margins,
but I need more. I need Berlin.

01:55.880 --> 01:57.962
How much do you think
I can do from in here...

01:58.160 --> 01:59.764
...Liz, chained to the floor?

01:59.960 --> 02:03.851
- You need to let me go, and then I can...
- The arms supplier.

02:04.040 --> 02:05.565
I want a name.

02:05.760 --> 02:08.330
I can try to reach out to Berlin.

02:08.560 --> 02:11.803
- But as long as I'm in here...
- I want a name.

02:15.440 --> 02:16.680
What month is it?

02:16.880 --> 02:18.041
November.

02:18.360 --> 02:20.647
Well, happy anniversary, Liz.

02:21.240 --> 02:23.641
You going to Passionfish to celebrate?

02:30.800 --> 02:32.484
I'm gonna freeze to death down here.

02:32.680 --> 02:34.569
You know that, right?

02:36.400 --> 02:38.050
Sevan.

02:40.560 --> 02:42.164
Sevan Volkov.

02:43.280 --> 02:46.204
He runs arms for Berlin.
He'd be able to set a meeting.

02:47.160 --> 02:49.367
That wasn't so hard, was it?

02:52.400 --> 02:54.129
So, what exactly did Reddington say?

02:54.600 --> 02:57.046
It was Dembe.
He said Red had another case...

02:57.280 --> 02:59.521
...but he specifically asked
that you come along.

02:59.720 --> 03:01.563
- Does that bother you?
- Why would it?

03:01.760 --> 03:03.489
I thought he only spoke to you.

03:03.920 --> 03:08.050
- Don't wanna step on your toes.
- I'm fine. My toes are fine.

03:09.320 --> 03:11.084
Ladies, thank God you showed up.

03:11.280 --> 03:13.442
I took a left turn in the Rostropovich.

03:13.640 --> 03:16.564
I've ended up
completely lost in the Chico Hamilton.

03:16.800 --> 03:20.441
This is an addiction.
I just can't decide between...

03:20.640 --> 03:22.881
Please pour some cold water on me,
will you?

03:23.080 --> 03:24.809
Why did you want both of us here?

03:25.000 --> 03:26.843
Both. You're right. Thank you.

03:27.040 --> 03:28.769
Great idea.

03:28.960 --> 03:31.725
Anyway, funny story...
Stop me if you've heard it.

03:31.920 --> 03:36.448
Persian man walks into a bar, meets
a beautiful woman, has a few drinks.

03:36.640 --> 03:40.087
Next thing you know,
he's falling from a 12-story balcony.

03:41.240 --> 03:44.528
- I don't get it.
- I imagine Agent Navabi does.

03:44.880 --> 03:46.723
You're referring to Kian Nouri...

03:46.920 --> 03:49.605
...the Iranian businessman
who committed suicide in Dubai.

03:49.800 --> 03:52.804
I am, except he wasn't
a mere businessman.

03:53.160 --> 03:56.323
He was one of Iran's
top nuclear scientists...

03:56.520 --> 03:58.921
...in Dubai to supervise purchase...

03:59.120 --> 04:02.329
...of several borehole gamma
something-or-others.

04:02.520 --> 04:05.842
And he didn't commit suicide.
He was assassinated...

04:06.080 --> 04:11.689
...in a joint CIA/Mossad venture
to undermine Iran's nuclear program.

04:11.880 --> 04:13.530
But then, you know this already.

04:13.720 --> 04:17.088
My understanding is,
she took a little detour to Dubai...

04:17.279 --> 04:21.125
...for a rendezvous with Mr. Nouri
so she could toss him off a building.

04:21.360 --> 04:22.771
You killed him?

04:22.960 --> 04:25.486
If you're asking me to comment
on a Mossad operation...

04:25.680 --> 04:26.966
...you know I can't do that.

04:27.240 --> 04:28.287
I wasn't asking.

04:28.560 --> 04:30.608
But I'm hardly one to judge.

04:30.800 --> 04:32.131
George Orwell wrote:

04:32.320 --> 04:35.051
"Those who abjure violence can do so...

04:35.240 --> 04:39.325
...only because others are
committing violence on their behalf."

04:39.520 --> 04:43.491
What a visionary, but, good Lord,
his books are a downer.

04:43.720 --> 04:49.011
The bad news is, I was sharing a bowl
of shisha with the Misiri minister...

04:49.200 --> 04:51.009
...and they plan to retaliate.

04:51.200 --> 04:54.807
You kill their top scientist,
they intend to kill yours.

04:55.000 --> 04:58.686
And they've dispatched a man
known as "the Scimitar" to do it.

04:58.880 --> 04:59.881
The Scimitar?

05:00.080 --> 05:02.686
This is not your average killer,
agent Keen.

05:02.880 --> 05:06.282
He's one part hit man,
two parts con man.

05:06.480 --> 05:07.766
I'm familiar with his work.

05:07.960 --> 05:12.363
In 2009, his target was a Sunni
tribal leader named Majeed Abd Bawi.

05:12.560 --> 05:15.609
The Scimitar gained access
by joining his militia.

05:15.800 --> 05:17.131
Oh, that's right.

05:17.320 --> 05:19.687
Fought for the man for seven months...

05:19.920 --> 05:24.608
...until the day he got close enough
to aerate Bawi's carotid with a fork.

05:24.840 --> 05:28.003
He's dedicated, resilient, cunning...

05:28.200 --> 05:31.807
...responsible for the murder
of dozens of high-value targets...

05:32.000 --> 05:36.801
...and according to my sources,
he's already on U.S. soil.

05:37.000 --> 05:39.731
Harold,
I'm the assistant secretary of NCB.

05:39.920 --> 05:42.571
I run point on all
international nuclear matters.

05:42.760 --> 05:46.003
If this guy was the threat you claim,
he'd be on my radar.

05:46.240 --> 05:49.164
- Who's your source on this threat?
- Confidential informant...

05:49.360 --> 05:51.761
...with an extremely reliable
track record.

05:52.160 --> 05:54.447
I'm afraid that's as specific as I can get.

05:54.880 --> 05:58.009
If I'm right,
what's our exposure on this?

06:00.040 --> 06:01.326
Cloud top.

06:01.720 --> 06:05.327
It's the classified designation
for a warhead project design.

06:05.520 --> 06:07.602
It's staffed by our top three scientists.

06:07.840 --> 06:10.320
If any of them fell into the hands
of a rogue nation...

06:10.520 --> 06:13.603
...that country's nuclear program
would advance decades overnight.

06:13.800 --> 06:15.643
What kind of security
you have in place?

06:15.840 --> 06:18.605
DSS provides false identities,
social security numbers...

06:18.800 --> 06:21.280
...even cover professions.
We hide them in plain sight.

06:21.520 --> 06:22.521
Sort of a...

06:22.720 --> 06:26.520
...witness protection for high-value
assets. - That's not gonna cut it.

06:26.720 --> 06:29.644
Pull these people off the streets
and into protective custody.

06:29.840 --> 06:32.650
All right, Harold.
I'll put two of them on lockdown.

06:32.840 --> 06:35.047
I can do that
without drawing too much scrutiny.

06:35.240 --> 06:36.446
And the third?

06:36.640 --> 06:38.802
That's gonna be a problem.

06:39.520 --> 06:41.409
The DOD asset is Amalia Collins...

06:41.600 --> 06:44.285
...senior engineer
of our warhead-design team.

06:44.480 --> 06:47.962
When she's not on active status, she's
a professor of astrophysics at Duke.

06:48.160 --> 06:50.686
Says here she's scheduled
to deliver a talk tonight...

06:50.880 --> 06:52.564
...at a symposium at Granville Hotel.

06:52.800 --> 06:56.327
DOD's reluctant to call it off last
minute because of scrutiny it would draw.

06:56.560 --> 06:59.723
- They feel it'd put her in more danger.
- They're not gonna pull her?

06:59.920 --> 07:02.120
No indications the Iranians
know her real value.

07:02.280 --> 07:04.203
Make sure it stays that way.
In the meantime...

07:04.440 --> 07:07.683
...we need to track this Scimitar
before he's able to ID our team.

07:09.160 --> 07:10.650
We need to talk.

07:12.360 --> 07:15.648
- I got things under control.
- Uh-huh. When's the last time you used?

07:16.200 --> 07:18.521
- Sitka, almost a week.
- This happens all the time.

07:18.720 --> 07:21.485
Agents taking meds to get over injuries
and they get hooked.

07:21.680 --> 07:23.921
- It's no big deal.
- What are you gonna do, Keen?

07:24.120 --> 07:26.240
- Tell Cooper I'm an addict?
- I want you to get help.

07:26.280 --> 07:28.886
And I'm telling you,
I can kick this on my own.

07:29.080 --> 07:32.163
And if I can't, hell,
I'll walk into Cooper's office myself.

07:32.680 --> 07:34.330
I got no problems with that.

07:51.000 --> 07:52.400
The camera's online.

07:52.720 --> 07:54.643
We got what we needed.

07:55.280 --> 07:57.851
You're looking at
Agent Jonathan Reese...

07:58.080 --> 08:00.128
...of the Defense Security Service.

08:07.440 --> 08:10.284
- I got your text. What's the problem?
- Zebra mussels.

08:10.480 --> 08:13.324
Fish and Game run
random inspections for invasive species.

08:13.520 --> 08:14.760
Zebra mussels.

08:14.960 --> 08:17.611
- Did they go inside?
- They tried to, but I held them off.

08:17.800 --> 08:19.245
But I don't know for how long.

08:19.440 --> 08:21.966
We're gonna either
have to move the boat or him.

08:30.600 --> 08:33.888
- Talk to Volkov?
- We have a meeting this afternoon.

08:34.080 --> 08:36.606
I brought you some warmer clothes.

08:38.280 --> 08:39.691
Well, that's nice.

08:41.039 --> 08:42.849
Now you care about me.

08:43.679 --> 08:48.083
Is that it, now you're concerned
for my well-being?

08:48.320 --> 08:52.325
You can try and make yourself feel better
about what you're doing...

08:52.840 --> 08:55.161
...but I told you the truth.

08:55.760 --> 08:58.127
I delivered on my word.

08:58.320 --> 09:01.290
- When are you gonna deliver on yours?
- We've been over this.

09:01.480 --> 09:06.281
You help me eliminate Berlin, and as far
as I'm concerned, this whole thing is over.

09:07.920 --> 09:09.445
Until then, enjoy the view.

09:09.640 --> 09:12.450
Liz. You can't keep me in here.

09:12.680 --> 09:15.365
Liz! You can't keep me in here!

09:16.120 --> 09:17.884
Damn it, Liz!

09:25.400 --> 09:28.768
Sevan Volkov.
Thank you for meeting with me.

09:29.360 --> 09:31.647
- And what choice did I have?
- Berlin.

09:31.880 --> 09:34.008
I know you supply him
with arms shipments.

09:34.200 --> 09:36.567
- And how you know this?
- Tell me where to find him.

09:36.800 --> 09:39.531
If you know anything about Berlin,
you know I can't do that.

09:39.800 --> 09:41.086
Thought you might say that.

09:41.280 --> 09:43.886
Which is why I nominated you
for our "most wanted" list.

09:44.080 --> 09:45.081
CID has approved it.

09:45.280 --> 09:48.807
- Just waiting for the director's signature.
- You gonna arrest me, arrest me.

09:49.000 --> 09:51.731
So you can sit silent in a cell
with an expensive attorney?

09:51.920 --> 09:53.729
I'd rather leave you out there.

09:53.920 --> 09:56.127
Let the world know
we're looking for you.

09:56.360 --> 09:58.647
Once this hits the streets,
Berlin will know...

09:58.840 --> 10:02.128
...the U.S. is spending limitless resources
and time looking for you.

10:02.320 --> 10:06.689
A man who has intimate details
about him and his business affairs.

10:06.880 --> 10:09.281
You have two options.

10:09.480 --> 10:11.642
Either you lead me to Berlin...

10:11.880 --> 10:13.803
...or I lead Berlin to you.

10:14.720 --> 10:17.405
How exactly did you
come upon this information?

10:17.600 --> 10:20.763
A Cl. Someone the Bureau trusts.

10:23.720 --> 10:25.688
I don't believe you.

10:25.880 --> 10:28.281
If the Bureau had a lead,
they'd follow it.

10:28.520 --> 10:31.490
You came to this on your own,
and you're hiding it from them.

10:31.680 --> 10:34.047
Coming to me instead.

10:34.240 --> 10:37.084
You'd rather see
Berlin dead than arrested.

10:37.320 --> 10:39.129
Berlin killed Meera.

10:39.360 --> 10:42.330
He nearly killed Cooper.
He put Tom into my life.

10:42.520 --> 10:45.967
So if you're asking if I'm okay
with a lethal outcome, damn right I am.

10:47.360 --> 10:48.725
Yeah.

10:48.960 --> 10:52.362
If you hadn't told me you'd killed Tom,
I might think he was your source.

10:52.560 --> 10:54.210
But I did kill him.

10:54.880 --> 10:56.245
Of course you did.

10:56.440 --> 10:59.603
Let me know when Volkov gets
a time and location on Berlin.

10:59.840 --> 11:02.047
I'll be there with bells on.

11:04.840 --> 11:06.001
What's going on?

11:06.200 --> 11:10.125
DOD discovered a surveillance camera
at their Annapolis office during a sweep.

11:10.320 --> 11:12.288
How is that relevant to us?

11:12.520 --> 11:14.841
Technology was Iranian.

11:15.040 --> 11:16.405
What were they recording?

11:16.600 --> 11:21.242
Okay, the camera was placed outside the
building with eyes to the front entrance.

11:21.440 --> 11:25.240
It was relaying a live stream to some
off-site location. If I reactivate it...

11:25.440 --> 11:28.649
...I should be able to triangulate
where the feed's being transmitted.

11:29.360 --> 11:33.410
Um... Oh, man. I almost forgot.

11:34.720 --> 11:37.371
In case someone's watching
on the other end.

11:41.440 --> 11:42.965
Camera is live.

11:44.520 --> 11:46.522
Okay, RDF is up.

11:47.120 --> 11:49.282
Signal strength looks good.

11:49.520 --> 11:51.682
Oh, accounting for time lag.

11:53.240 --> 11:55.720
And we have a lock.

11:55.880 --> 11:57.723
It's a property outside New Carrollton.

11:57.920 --> 12:00.446
And it looks like it's a construction site.

12:06.640 --> 12:07.926
FBI!

12:10.200 --> 12:12.043
- Clear.
- Clear.

12:13.040 --> 12:14.201
Trailer's secure.

12:14.400 --> 12:17.244
Lock it down.
I want eyes on all access points.

12:19.440 --> 12:22.489
- So where the hell is everyone?
- No idea.

12:22.720 --> 12:25.326
But could this be
the man they were surveilling?

12:27.240 --> 12:30.005
"Jonathan Reese.

12:30.200 --> 12:34.489
Agent Jonathan Everett Reese,
Defense Security Services."

12:34.680 --> 12:37.251
They've got everything him.
Addresses, phone numbers...

12:37.480 --> 12:39.642
...employment history.
- DSS is the division...

12:39.840 --> 12:41.569
...protecting our nuclear scientists.

12:41.760 --> 12:43.728
They're logging his movements.

12:43.920 --> 12:47.367
Probably trying to find the
most vulnerable point of attack.

12:48.040 --> 12:49.565
It's the DSS shuttle stop.

12:49.760 --> 12:52.286
He takes the train back
from Annapolis every afternoon.

12:52.480 --> 12:56.041
He'll be at the Park-N-Ride off route 50.
We got to get there before they do.

13:13.240 --> 13:16.562
- Jonathan Reese. FBI.
- What's this about?

13:16.760 --> 13:18.728
We need to move.
I'll explain in the car.

13:21.880 --> 13:24.121
Shooter's on the ridge.
I don't have eyes.

13:33.720 --> 13:37.167
I got threat assessments this morning
of a possible Iranian Misiri action.

13:37.360 --> 13:39.761
They want names
and locations of cloud-top personnel.

13:40.000 --> 13:43.129
You need to notify your people.
Activate all security protocols.

14:22.760 --> 14:25.001
Sir, I think we have a problem.

14:25.200 --> 14:28.329
- I can't reach Keen or Ressler.
- Send a team to their last location.

14:28.520 --> 14:30.363
Find out what the hell is going on.

14:47.640 --> 14:48.766
Ah!

14:50.480 --> 14:52.642
Take it easy, Agent Keen.

14:53.680 --> 14:55.444
You're at Bethesda.

14:55.840 --> 14:57.888
I'm Dr. Rivera.

14:58.120 --> 15:00.248
You and your partner
were in an accident.

15:00.440 --> 15:01.680
Is he okay?

15:01.920 --> 15:04.844
Agent Ressler suffered significant
head trauma in the crash.

15:05.040 --> 15:08.408
He's had a CT scan.
Radiology will take him for an MRI shortly.

15:08.600 --> 15:11.763
- My arm?
- Fractured in three places.

15:12.120 --> 15:16.284
We set it for now. But to be honest, you
may need surgery to restore full mobility.

15:17.840 --> 15:19.808
John Reese.

15:20.000 --> 15:21.684
The man who was in the car with us.

15:22.480 --> 15:23.811
I'm sorry?

15:24.000 --> 15:25.968
Nobody else was
transported from the scene.

15:26.160 --> 15:27.605
No, but he was in the car.

15:27.800 --> 15:30.690
I'm the attending on duty.
No one else was brought in.

15:30.880 --> 15:32.484
I need a phone. Unh!

15:32.680 --> 15:33.806
- Easy.
- Listen.

15:34.800 --> 15:36.529
That crash was no accident.

15:37.080 --> 15:38.525
Understood.

15:38.720 --> 15:40.768
I'll have one brought in right away.

15:44.640 --> 15:46.720
We're seeing multiple 911 calls
within the last hour.

15:46.880 --> 15:50.930
They report a black SUV overturned under
a mile from where they picked up Reese.

15:51.120 --> 15:52.929
Cross-reference local police activity.

15:53.120 --> 15:57.125
Two passengers were pulled from the
wreck and evac'd to Bethesda National.

15:57.320 --> 15:58.924
- Only two?
- A man and a woman.

15:59.120 --> 16:02.841
We have to assume that's Agent Keen
and either Ressler or the DOD employee.

16:03.040 --> 16:06.362
- One of them didn't survive?
- I want you there as soon as possible.

16:06.560 --> 16:08.961
I'll update Mullen at DOD.

16:11.000 --> 16:13.731
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

16:29.520 --> 16:32.000
- Assistant Director Cooper.
- It's me.

16:32.480 --> 16:33.811
Agent Keen.

16:34.000 --> 16:36.731
You've no idea how good it is
to hear your voice. You okay?

16:36.920 --> 16:39.127
Yeah, I'm fine.

16:39.960 --> 16:42.804
But Ressler, he's hurt.

16:44.000 --> 16:46.241
The Iranians have John Reese.

16:46.600 --> 16:49.080
I heard some men's voices
before I passed out.

16:49.320 --> 16:53.689
They were speaking Farsi. Someone
needs to find Professor Collins.

16:53.880 --> 16:58.681
The DOD needs to cancel that speech,
and put her in protective custody now.

16:58.880 --> 17:00.405
I've already alerted the DOD.

17:00.600 --> 17:04.400
I'm heading to the event site myself
to make sure she's on lockdown.

17:04.599 --> 17:08.161
Agent Keen, the Neurology team
at Bethesda's one of the best.

17:08.359 --> 17:11.204
They'll take good care of Ressler.
Navabi's on her way to you.

17:11.880 --> 17:13.608
Get some rest.

17:38.480 --> 17:40.323
- Thanks for coming.
- I got your message.

17:40.520 --> 17:43.569
John Reese was abducted by the
Iranians a little over an hour ago.

17:43.760 --> 17:46.730
We need to pull Collins. I need
anything you can give on Reese...

17:46.960 --> 17:50.248
Harold, I checked. There is no
DOD employee named John Reese.

17:50.440 --> 17:53.762
- Not in DSS, not in any sector.
- Our people spoke to Reese directly.

17:53.960 --> 17:56.566
The Iranians have his profile,
his DSS security badge.

17:56.800 --> 17:59.041
I thought it might be an alias.
He doesn't exist.

17:59.240 --> 18:02.210
Sir? Just got off the
phone with Bethesda National.

18:02.400 --> 18:05.847
The hospital has no record of
agents Keen or Ressler being brought in.

18:07.560 --> 18:09.164
I just spoke to her.

18:10.320 --> 18:11.890
How's everything in here?

18:12.080 --> 18:13.605
Okay.

18:14.280 --> 18:16.123
You're doing okay, hon?

18:16.360 --> 18:17.771
Yeah.

18:17.960 --> 18:21.726
What happened to Radiology? They were
gonna take him for another scan.

18:21.920 --> 18:24.287
Oh, well, I'm sure
someone will be down soon.

18:27.280 --> 18:29.282
He's your partner, isn't he?

18:29.600 --> 18:31.090
I understand.

18:34.960 --> 18:37.167
I'll call him right now.

19:01.480 --> 19:02.970
Ma'am, Agent Keen...

19:03.200 --> 19:05.806
...you can't be up.
- We need to get the radiologist now.

19:06.280 --> 19:08.601
Oh, okay.
Okay, you're fine. You're all right.

19:08.800 --> 19:14.091
- I'm sorry. We need to get Radiology in.
- Let's get you back in bed. You're fine.

19:14.280 --> 19:17.204
- Okay.
- Oh, my gosh, I'm so sorry.

19:17.400 --> 19:19.846
- I'm so sorry.
- It's all right. You just relax.

19:20.760 --> 19:23.969
- We need to get Radiology.
- Okay, take it easy.

19:24.160 --> 19:25.650
Take it easy.

19:25.840 --> 19:26.921
Thank you.

19:49.920 --> 19:53.641
I never eat anchovies unless
I don't know I'm eating them.

19:56.480 --> 19:58.881
But I have to say,
this is pretty delicious.

19:59.080 --> 20:01.128
Anchovies get a bad rap.

20:01.400 --> 20:03.289
Try the wine.

20:09.000 --> 20:11.002
- It would be better with beer.
- Heh, heh.

20:11.200 --> 20:13.282
It might very well be better with beer.

20:15.320 --> 20:19.006
- Do you have kids, Kenneth?
- I do. A daughter.

20:21.520 --> 20:22.851
The two of you close?

20:24.720 --> 20:26.722
It's complicated.

20:27.000 --> 20:30.049
- She doesn't like anchovies?
- Heh, heh, heh.

20:31.640 --> 20:34.166
You know, I don't know about that.

20:41.360 --> 20:43.806
I wish it were that simple.

20:44.360 --> 20:47.728
My father, he and I...

20:49.200 --> 20:53.489
My father did things I hated him for.

20:54.640 --> 20:56.130
Things that were...

20:56.320 --> 20:58.482
...unforgivable.

21:01.440 --> 21:03.044
Have you told him?

21:04.320 --> 21:06.800
I haven't seen my father...

21:08.680 --> 21:11.206
...in a long...

21:11.400 --> 21:13.448
...long time.

21:31.600 --> 21:33.250
What have you done?

21:34.120 --> 21:36.964
It's okay. It's okay.

21:40.600 --> 21:43.444
- Unh.
- I'm not gonna hurt you.

21:53.720 --> 21:55.051
We got played.

21:55.240 --> 21:57.288
The Scimitar created John Reese.

21:57.480 --> 22:01.121
Which means we didn't find that
construction trailer. We were led there.

22:01.320 --> 22:04.051
Everything in that trailer was
to make us think Reese was DSS.

22:04.240 --> 22:06.288
- Why?
- So when we lost him, we would think...

22:06.480 --> 22:10.246
...the identity of our scientist was in
jeopardy. All done to trigger a reaction.

22:10.440 --> 22:12.010
They isolated Keen and Ressler.

22:12.200 --> 22:15.409
Made them believe that losing Reese
was a threat to national security.

22:15.640 --> 22:18.371
This was all a con
done to expose Amalia Collins.

22:18.600 --> 22:21.570
So where the heck is
agents Keen and Ressler?

22:21.760 --> 22:24.411
Someone needs to find Professor Collins.

22:24.600 --> 22:26.887
The DOD needs to
cancel that speech...

22:27.080 --> 22:29.606
...and put her
in protective custody now.

22:29.800 --> 22:31.643
We ran the name
as soon as we heard it.

22:31.840 --> 22:34.491
There's an astrophysics professor
named Amalia Collins.

22:34.680 --> 22:39.561
She's speaking today.
Granville Hotel, downtown D.C.

22:41.240 --> 22:44.687
I'm looking forward to
meeting Professor Collins.

22:45.600 --> 22:47.011
You need to move quickly, sir.

22:47.840 --> 22:48.921
I'm leaving now.

22:49.240 --> 22:51.129
Make sure to clean things up here.

22:52.920 --> 22:55.969
- And the agents?
- We're finished with them.

23:37.320 --> 23:38.367
Good news.

23:38.920 --> 23:42.641
Radiology called. They'll be down
for your partner in the next 20 minutes.

23:42.840 --> 23:45.241
That's great. Thank you.

23:45.480 --> 23:47.847
- What's that?
- It's just a little something...

23:48.040 --> 23:50.327
...so that arm of yours
doesn't get infected. Ah!

23:53.160 --> 23:55.322
You tell me what's in the syringe...

23:55.520 --> 23:58.729
...or I will stick it in you
and find out for myself.

23:58.920 --> 24:00.729
It's a sedative. Please don't.

24:01.120 --> 24:03.566
- What's in his IV?
- Same thing.

24:03.760 --> 24:06.206
Who are you? Where is this hospital?

24:06.400 --> 24:08.482
Doctor! Unh!

24:19.080 --> 24:20.684
Ressler?

24:21.880 --> 24:23.609
Ressler? Ressler?

24:24.400 --> 24:26.368
Can you hear me?
We gotta get out of here.

24:28.000 --> 24:29.650
They're definitely not at Bethesda.

24:29.840 --> 24:33.401
Cooper went to secure Collins. I traced
the call Liz made to Cooper's cell.

24:33.600 --> 24:36.570
Their rerouting and encryption
are incredibly sophisticated.

24:36.800 --> 24:39.485
- This is gonna take hours to untangle.
- Okay. What's next?

24:39.680 --> 24:42.240
Cooper's pulled six teams
from other assignments. He sent them...

24:43.520 --> 24:44.521
Hello?

24:49.120 --> 24:51.885
Dembe, it's Agent Navabi.
We have a situation.

25:13.800 --> 25:16.041
We gotta go now.

25:17.480 --> 25:20.529
It's been over two hours.
I don't need to tell you his reputation.

25:20.720 --> 25:24.088
- Once he has the intelligence he needs...
- Yes, I know, Agent Navabi.

25:24.720 --> 25:28.327
- Tell me about this lead of yours.
- He's not my lead.

25:28.520 --> 25:30.887
His name is Ali Hassan.

25:31.080 --> 25:33.128
He's the target
of a major Mossad initiative.

25:33.320 --> 25:36.483
I have a slight but memorable
acquaintance with Mr. Hassan.

25:36.720 --> 25:39.087
Mossad has been tracking
his movements for months.

25:39.280 --> 25:43.808
My superiors believe he's the key
to unraveling a dozen covert Iranian ops.

25:44.000 --> 25:46.526
But you think he knows
where to find the Scimitar.

25:47.080 --> 25:48.730
Perhaps.

25:49.840 --> 25:53.322
Mossad has no tolerance
for any agenda except Mossad's.

25:53.520 --> 25:56.330
You'll be sanctioned
for this indiscretion.

25:56.520 --> 25:58.090
So be it.

25:58.320 --> 26:02.006
I can't work with this task force unless
my partners are my highest priority.

26:02.840 --> 26:06.242
So this has become quite personal.

26:07.760 --> 26:09.171
I understand.

26:09.360 --> 26:12.409
But you may have an even more
personal stake in this case...

26:12.600 --> 26:14.887
...than perhaps you realize.
- And why is that?

26:15.080 --> 26:19.847
Because one of the Scimitar's
little-known aliases is "Walid Abu Sitta."

26:22.160 --> 26:25.323
Walid Abu Sitta ordered the bombing
that killed my brother.

26:25.560 --> 26:28.643
Yes. That's why
I brought this case to you.

26:37.000 --> 26:38.047
There.

27:01.760 --> 27:03.250
What was that?

27:03.440 --> 27:04.851
You hear that?

27:06.760 --> 27:08.762
Farid, what's going on?

27:09.280 --> 27:10.327
Farid?

27:12.200 --> 27:16.285
- Hassan. I love this club.
- Son of a bitch.

27:16.480 --> 27:18.482
- Carbon fiber?
- Reddington, stop.

27:19.760 --> 27:21.091
Stop!

27:21.800 --> 27:24.201
Damn it. What have you done
with my guard?

27:24.400 --> 27:26.129
Farid is taking a rest.

27:26.720 --> 27:29.849
Keep your plum covered.
We're not alone.

27:30.400 --> 27:32.004
I'll take your weapon.

27:33.800 --> 27:38.442
I've always regretted sparing your
life that night in the Strait of Hormuz.

27:39.120 --> 27:41.327
But I see pity has its rewards.

27:41.520 --> 27:44.524
- Live and learn.
- You've been very careless, Ali.

27:44.760 --> 27:46.603
We've been
surveilling you for months.

27:46.800 --> 27:49.280
The intelligence we've gathered
has been very helpful.

27:49.520 --> 27:52.649
So helpful that I fully expect
to be disciplined for coming here...

27:52.840 --> 27:54.001
...without authorization.

27:54.520 --> 27:58.605
Just by being here, I have everything,
and therefore nothing, to lose.

27:59.480 --> 28:00.527
What do you want?

28:01.600 --> 28:03.489
The Scimitar.

28:03.680 --> 28:05.682
My friend thinks you know
where to find him.

28:05.880 --> 28:07.723
He would've needed support
in the States.

28:07.920 --> 28:09.809
I'm guessing that support
came from you.

28:10.560 --> 28:12.642
I know what you must be thinking, Ali.

28:12.840 --> 28:15.366
Imagine your future,
the rest of your life...

28:15.560 --> 28:19.610
...spent in a dismal Israeli prison,
some dark hole they put you in...

28:19.840 --> 28:24.846
...bending your fingers and pulling your
toes until they forget you ever existed.

28:26.040 --> 28:27.644
Think carefully, Ali...

28:27.840 --> 28:29.683
...because as you are my witness...

28:29.880 --> 28:34.568
...that future will seem very bright, indeed,
if you don't tell us what we want to know.

28:38.240 --> 28:40.447
He did make contact.

28:40.640 --> 28:42.483
Asked to use one of my warehouses.

28:42.680 --> 28:45.650
Said he needed building supplies.

28:45.920 --> 28:47.649
For what, I don't know.

28:47.840 --> 28:50.127
Tell me about this warehouse.

29:04.240 --> 29:05.969
Let him in.

29:32.880 --> 29:34.484
Keen!

29:44.120 --> 29:46.407
Reddington, I have them.

29:49.640 --> 29:52.080
Director Cooper.
Owen Doherty. We spoke on the phone.

29:52.240 --> 29:54.129
- Where are we?
- We canceled the event...

29:54.320 --> 29:57.449
...initiated evac protocol.
We've placed Collins in a holding room.

29:57.640 --> 29:59.642
- She have security detail?
- Two on the door.

29:59.840 --> 30:00.841
Take me to her.

30:07.240 --> 30:08.287
Who is it?

30:08.480 --> 30:10.801
Mrs. Collins? FBI.

30:11.000 --> 30:13.162
I need you to open the door, please.

30:21.080 --> 30:23.686
Professor Collins.

30:23.960 --> 30:28.249
You are going to pay the price for the
crimes committed by your government.

30:28.440 --> 30:32.047
But first, you're gonna help us
create the weapon...

30:32.240 --> 30:34.971
...that will be used
to bring this country to its knees.

30:38.960 --> 30:40.928
You said there were two men
posted outside.

30:41.120 --> 30:42.804
There were.

30:47.600 --> 30:49.284
On my ready.

30:57.280 --> 31:00.090
- Clear.
- Not here, sir.

31:01.640 --> 31:05.167
Let's hope she's still in the building.
Nobody leaves until we find Collins.

31:11.960 --> 31:14.167
Collins is missing.
Cooper thinks she's still on-site.

31:14.360 --> 31:15.930
Okay. Listen up, folks.

31:16.120 --> 31:19.522
We have a situation here.
We need everyone to move inside.

31:19.720 --> 31:22.883
- Now. Let's go.
- Please. Move into the lobby. Sir?

31:23.240 --> 31:24.446
Sir?

31:39.800 --> 31:41.802
Sir, don't move.

31:42.040 --> 31:43.690
Hands where I can see them.

31:43.920 --> 31:45.763
Slowly.

31:49.920 --> 31:51.206
Hello, Agent Keen.

31:53.440 --> 31:56.410
I see you've made
a spectacular recovery.

32:03.520 --> 32:05.090
Go inside.

32:59.680 --> 33:01.250
We've suffered a setback.

33:01.440 --> 33:03.727
No, no, no. I'll need the full package.

33:03.960 --> 33:07.123
New credentials,
a safe house, and 50,000...

33:10.280 --> 33:11.850
No.

33:12.120 --> 33:14.407
I'll need it within the hour.

33:16.520 --> 33:19.490
All this running around. Really?

33:19.720 --> 33:23.247
I'm so relieved
when the people I'm chasing...

33:23.480 --> 33:25.323
...come to me.

33:48.400 --> 33:50.323
Agent Navabi, you got my message.

33:50.520 --> 33:53.285
We were just admiring the view.

33:54.400 --> 33:55.447
How did you know?

33:55.640 --> 33:58.086
Mr. Hassan provided
for our friend before...

33:58.280 --> 34:02.922
...and most criminals return
to the same trough time and time again.

34:03.320 --> 34:05.766
Indolence, I suppose.

34:06.200 --> 34:09.443
Personally, I make it a habit
to avoid habits.

34:09.639 --> 34:12.803
- I can call it in.
- Yes, I suppose you can.

34:13.000 --> 34:14.889
The question is, do you want to?

34:15.080 --> 34:17.047
I offer him to you as a gift.

34:17.960 --> 34:20.645
- What am I supposed to do with him?
- Whatever you like.

34:21.000 --> 34:23.525
Nobody else knows he's here.

34:25.800 --> 34:27.529
Agent Keen just called.

34:27.719 --> 34:29.688
Her source provided Berlin's location.

34:29.920 --> 34:32.730
Forgive me. I have an appointment
that can't be rescheduled.

34:33.159 --> 34:35.811
Don't do anything I wouldn't do.

34:52.679 --> 34:53.841
Shahin Navabi.

34:54.520 --> 34:55.601
He was my brother.

34:56.360 --> 34:57.691
One of the many nameless...

34:57.880 --> 34:59.370
...faceless men you killed in Pishin.

35:01.760 --> 35:03.569
Pishin was the work of a suicide bomber.

35:03.760 --> 35:05.171
Acting under your direction.

35:05.960 --> 35:07.121
You're wrong.

35:08.600 --> 35:11.126
I know the name Shahin Navabi.

35:12.240 --> 35:13.321
I saw him.

35:13.920 --> 35:16.082
Spoke to him the day he died.

35:16.360 --> 35:17.407
You're lying.

35:17.600 --> 35:19.284
If you think your beloved brother...

35:19.480 --> 35:23.849
...was just another faceless young man
in that crowd...

35:24.040 --> 35:25.485
...you know nothing.

35:31.640 --> 35:33.529
I Will kill you.

35:34.080 --> 35:35.969
Like Kian Nouri?

35:36.160 --> 35:38.481
The scientist you murdered
last week in Dubai?

35:38.680 --> 35:40.682
What do you know about my brother?

35:42.680 --> 35:47.163
There's no country
insisting you do your duty.

35:47.760 --> 35:48.921
If you kill me...

35:49.480 --> 35:51.562
...it'll be cold-blooded murder.

35:51.760 --> 35:55.367
So call the Mossad or the CIA...

35:55.560 --> 35:58.769
...or whoever's coming
and be done with it.

36:19.480 --> 36:22.324
I thought for a second
we might lose you back there.

36:26.240 --> 36:29.608
Prospect of having to live without me...

36:29.920 --> 36:31.285
...must've been terrifying.

36:33.200 --> 36:34.531
It was.

36:35.720 --> 36:38.041
The irony is...

36:39.320 --> 36:43.689
...with all the drugs they pumped in me,
this is the best I've felt all week.

36:45.880 --> 36:48.008
What about that?
Is that gonna be a problem?

36:49.680 --> 36:52.889
I just got a call
from M.P.D. Harbor Patrol.

36:53.080 --> 36:55.048
They fished a body
out of the Anacostia.

36:55.560 --> 36:58.848
Matches your description of the Scimitar.
Get there.

36:59.040 --> 37:00.485
Yes, sir.

37:02.000 --> 37:05.083
- Hm?
- I'll catch up.

This was an execution.

- He gave us a location on Berlin.

38:06.680 --> 38:08.728
We'll see how that pans out.

38:08.920 --> 38:11.400
The information I gave you...

38:11.960 --> 38:13.450
...is good.

38:13.680 --> 38:16.160
Volkov will lead to Berlin.

38:16.360 --> 38:18.886
Reddington will kill Berlin.

38:20.520 --> 38:22.966
And my value to you...

38:23.160 --> 38:24.730
...will end.

38:24.920 --> 38:26.763
And then what?

38:28.480 --> 38:30.050
You gonna turn me in, Liz?

38:31.680 --> 38:34.331
Lose your job, go to jail?

38:34.600 --> 38:37.763
Heh. The only way to get me
out of your life...

38:38.000 --> 38:40.970
...Liz, is to let me go
because if you kill me...

38:41.240 --> 38:43.971
If you go through with it,
then we'll be linked forever.

38:44.160 --> 38:48.324
Even if you get away with it,
even if nobody ever finds out...

38:49.960 --> 38:52.486

39:08.840 --> 39:12.481
Oh, I knew the second you brought me
down here that you had no intention...

39:12.680 --> 39:14.330
...of letting me live.

39:18.320 --> 39:20.368
So here's the deal...

39:21.120 --> 39:22.770

39:23.000 --> 39:25.810
You're gonna do
whatever the hell you're gonna do.

39:26.000 --> 39:28.082
You always have.

39:29.800 --> 39:31.928
Just do me a favor.

I know you were expecting Volkov...

40:28.360 --> 40:31.523
...but as luck would have it,
he sold you out to Agent Keen.

40:31.720 --> 40:35.441
It's surprising she came to me
instead of the Bureau...

40:35.640 --> 40:37.483
...with the hope that I would kill you.

40:37.680 --> 40:39.170
I have other plans.

40:39.520 --> 40:43.161
First, understand
I didn't have to come here alone.

40:43.360 --> 40:46.967
In fact, I didn't have to come here at all.
I could've sent seven men...

40:47.160 --> 40:49.322
...and put an end to this war.
- Why didn't you?

40:49.520 --> 40:51.568
Because this entire affair...

40:51.800 --> 40:55.930
...every ounce of pain and suffering
that all of us have endured...

40:56.120 --> 41:00.682
...has been the result of a tragic,
and mysterious misunderstanding.

41:00.880 --> 41:02.564
One I intend to correct.

41:02.960 --> 41:06.806
There's not much left
I truly cherish in this world...

41:07.000 --> 41:11.642
...but I swear
on those few things I still hold dear...

41:11.840 --> 41:14.889
...I did not kill your daughter.

41:15.080 --> 41:17.128
Words, words.

41:17.320 --> 41:20.130
The greater the words,
the larger the lie.

41:20.840 --> 41:23.650
My daughter is dead.

41:23.840 --> 41:25.649
But yours...

41:25.840 --> 41:29.890
My men tell me you've been spending
a lot of time together.

41:30.080 --> 41:34.210
Maybe, when I've done
to your daughter...

41:34.400 --> 41:36.209
...what you did to mine...

41:36.400 --> 41:39.404
...we can finally be even.

41:40.760 --> 41:42.683
I'm sorry.

42:00.880 --> 42:04.043
Is this the daughter you're referring to?

42:08.400 --> 42:10.562
Because she's not my daughter.

42:11.440 --> 42:13.124
She's yours.
