00:02.800 --> 00:04.120
Hey, Glenn, you want
to try some peanut brittle?

00:04.240 --> 00:05.113
Uh, no way, Lola.

00:05.193 --> 00:08.151
Last time you tried this on me, I opened
it and a bunch of snakes popped out.

00:08.220 --> 00:09.052
I know.

00:09.121 --> 00:11.586
But this time, it's just peanut brittle.
I promise.

00:11.622 --> 00:13.743
Hmm.
It does look tasty.

00:13.863 --> 00:15.086
- Yeah.
- All right. Cool.

00:15.155 --> 00:16.053
I'm gonna try it later.

00:16.090 --> 00:17.355
Okay. See you later.

00:17.391 --> 00:19.357
Thank you.

00:22.060 --> 00:23.557
You were incredible
in there, Owen.

00:23.660 --> 00:25.724
Tell me something I don't know.

00:25.760 --> 00:29.518
Okay, uh, all interstates that
run north-south have odd numbers.

00:29.638 --> 00:32.073
Think about it.
I-95, I-75.

00:32.192 --> 00:33.677
- I did not know that.
- Yeah.

00:33.797 --> 00:34.752
Now I know.

<i>Attention, staff.</i>
<i>Ladies get 50% off today.</i>

00:57.345 --> 01:00.778
We just came in for an appendectomy
because it's <i>so</i> much cheaper tonight.

01:00.814 --> 01:02.025
<i>And can you give him six flu shots now?</i>

01:02.145 --> 01:04.706
<i>Just trying to take advantage
of the ladies night discount.</i>

01:06.150 --> 01:08.067
<i>Can I get some of that?</i>

01:09.619 --> 01:10.519
<i>Thank you.</i>

01:10.587 --> 01:13.021
Ladies night is the
perfect night to meet women

01:13.056 --> 01:14.689
because it combines their
two favorite things.

01:14.757 --> 01:16.123
Cooking and cleaning?

01:16.158 --> 01:16.589
No.

01:16.658 --> 01:18.324
Ryan gosling and rice pudding?

01:18.359 --> 01:18.757
No.

01:18.793 --> 01:20.225
Tattoo and tattoo removal?

01:20.294 --> 01:20.692
No.

01:20.727 --> 01:22.527
Saving money and taking
care of their kids.

01:22.595 --> 01:25.495
It is the perfect night to have
sex with vulnerable babes.

01:26.298 --> 01:27.597
Ladies night sucks.

01:27.632 --> 01:30.600
All the guys turn into walking,
talking guys with penises.

01:30.636 --> 01:31.435
Yeah!

01:31.503 --> 01:35.039
I cannot wait to dive into
some of this single-mom tail.

01:35.074 --> 01:35.706
Yeah!

01:35.775 --> 01:39.775
Can't wait to meet a woman, settle down,
get to know her, and raise a family!

01:41.145 --> 01:43.610
If men can't respect us
women as smart and powerful

01:47.315 --> 01:49.248
I mean, girl doctors can be
just like real doctors if we

01:49.283 --> 01:50.148
were only given a chance.

01:50.217 --> 01:51.250
Let's get out of here.

01:51.285 --> 01:51.683
Yeah.

01:51.719 --> 01:52.517
Wait, doctors.

01:52.586 --> 01:53.518
You have patients waiting.

01:53.554 --> 01:54.352
Not now, Dori!

01:54.388 --> 01:55.320
We're getting out of here!

01:55.355 --> 01:56.054
Oh.

01:56.123 --> 01:57.784
So, tell me, did it hurt?

01:57.819 --> 01:59.118
Yes. My tummy hurts.

01:59.153 --> 02:01.586
I am not <i>talking</i> to you!

02:01.622 --> 02:04.523
So, did it hurt when you
fell down from heaven?

02:04.592 --> 02:08.627
Because falls like that
tend to hurt... Stacy.

02:08.696 --> 02:09.995
Oh.

02:10.064 --> 02:13.698
It's a good thing I know how to
do CPR on myself because you

02:13.733 --> 02:18.234
take my breath away... Stacy.

02:18.270 --> 02:21.037
I'm a very giving
person, both in my medical

02:21.072 --> 02:23.039
practice and my relationships.

02:23.074 --> 02:26.509
I'm looking for a special lady to
share that with... "stomach cramps."

02:26.544 --> 02:28.177
What is going on here?

02:28.246 --> 02:30.246
Are you gonna look at my son or...?

02:31.783 --> 02:33.983
You have a voice -- a
voice like a hummingbird.

02:34.052 --> 02:35.251
I'm a serial monogamist.

02:35.319 --> 02:36.352
I like that you care.

02:36.421 --> 02:38.320
You know, so many people
nowadays don't care anymore.

02:38.356 --> 02:39.321
I bleach my teeth.

02:39.357 --> 02:42.358
His stomach started to hurt --
You're a natural storyteller.

02:42.393 --> 02:43.692
I'll take a look at your son.

02:43.728 --> 02:45.260
I don't --
I have a speedboat.

02:45.329 --> 02:46.061
Dr. Richie.

02:46.096 --> 02:48.163
A woman has <i>specifically
requested you by name.</i>

02:48.231 --> 02:49.164
<i>Sy, please.</i>

02:49.232 --> 02:50.331
<i>This child needs my help.</i>

02:50.367 --> 02:51.700
<i>No, you don't understand.</i>

02:51.735 --> 02:55.070
<i>She said you were the
handsomest, smartest doctor in</i>

02:55.105 --> 02:56.071
<i>the hospital!</i>

02:56.106 --> 02:57.639
<i>I got to go.</i>

02:57.708 --> 03:01.343
<i>So, uh, is there
a Mr. stomach cramps?</i>

03:01.378 --> 03:02.344
<i>Whoa!</i>

03:02.379 --> 03:03.511
<i>Don't worry.</i>

03:03.547 --> 03:05.446
<i>You're in Dr. Maestro's hands now.</i>

03:05.515 --> 03:07.648
<i>Good, 'cause my stomach really hurts!</i>

03:07.717 --> 03:11.151
<i>I am not talking</i> to you!

03:12.288 --> 03:16.289
The doctor is in, and I hear
someone needs an injection of -- mom?!

03:16.358 --> 03:17.391
What are you doing here?

03:17.459 --> 03:19.359
What does it look like I'm doing here?

03:19.395 --> 03:20.294
I'm having a baby.

03:20.362 --> 03:21.461
You're pregnant?

03:21.530 --> 03:23.530
You think I'm <i>this</i> fat all the time?

03:23.565 --> 03:25.298
Oh, thank you very much, Mr. man.

03:25.367 --> 03:28.000
Why didn't you tell
me you were pregnant?!

03:28.035 --> 03:29.365
I didn't want to worry you.

03:29.400 --> 03:32.466
The bottom line is I'm having
this baby tonight, and God

03:32.535 --> 03:35.635
forbid I should want my doctor
son to deliver his sibling.

03:35.704 --> 03:37.470
But it's ladies night.

03:37.505 --> 03:39.538
So your mother's not a lady now?

03:39.574 --> 03:43.008
I have an engorged vagina, but
that's not enough to convince my

03:43.077 --> 03:44.176
son that I'm a lady.

03:44.211 --> 03:47.011
Fine. You're a lady.

03:48.580 --> 03:50.647
I'm proud to be a woman.

03:50.682 --> 03:52.382
Oh, let's get some fish tacos!

03:52.451 --> 03:56.552
Well, yelp says the best ones are
at this bar in the market district.

03:56.588 --> 03:58.554
Isn't that a
low-income neighborhood?

03:58.590 --> 04:01.190
Honey, the best ones usually are.

04:01.225 --> 04:02.992
Girl power!

04:03.027 --> 04:05.294
Me, too! Girl power!

04:05.329 --> 04:08.398
Well, I certainly didn't
come here expecting <i>this</i>

04:08.433 --> 04:09.131
<i>to happen.</i>

04:10.368 --> 04:12.367
<i>It's all so overwhelming.</i>

04:13.404 --> 04:14.569
<i>That's for you.</i>

04:14.604 --> 04:16.404
<i>Is it your phone number?</i>

04:16.473 --> 04:18.672
<i>Or let me guess -- is
it your e-mail address?</i>

04:18.707 --> 04:19.639
<i>I'm on e-mail now.</i>

04:19.675 --> 04:21.673
<i>My nephew's got me all
set up on e-mail.</i>

04:21.743 --> 04:24.678
<i>No, it's a
prescription for your kid.</i>

04:24.713 --> 04:27.214
<i>Oh.</i>

04:27.249 --> 04:28.482
<i>Oh, I'm sorry.</i>

04:28.551 --> 04:29.483
<i>Yeah?</i>

04:29.552 --> 04:32.553
<i>It also might cause diarrhea.</i>

04:58.714 --> 05:00.681
<i>Chief, what are you doing here?</i>

05:00.750 --> 05:03.584
I think the question is
what are you gals not doing

05:03.620 --> 05:07.955
here every night like I <i>am</i> here?

05:08.024 --> 05:09.390
I come here every night.

05:09.426 --> 05:13.060
Yep, this is my favorite place
to gather with my fellow sistas

05:13.129 --> 05:15.329
and celebrate the female experience.

05:15.398 --> 05:18.967
Are you saying that this
place is entirely guy-free?

05:19.035 --> 05:21.236
You bet your sweet ass it is.

05:21.304 --> 05:24.339
Hey, and now that I'm seeing
that thing, you do have an

05:24.407 --> 05:25.706
exceptionally sweet ass.

05:25.742 --> 05:30.244
It is so nice to finally get a
female's perspective on such topics as

05:30.280 --> 05:31.045
Cat's ass.

05:31.081 --> 05:34.582
Ladies, I think we've
come to the right place.

05:34.617 --> 05:35.716
<i>Attention, staff.</i>

05:35.752 --> 05:38.987
<i>Keep your laws and, more
immediately, your hands off my body.</i>

05:39.022 --> 05:40.622
<i>I'm missing the fun!</i>

05:40.691 --> 05:42.625
<i>Glen!!</i>

05:42.693 --> 05:44.627
<i>Coming!</i>

05:47.231 --> 05:48.364
<i>Ohh! Where were you?</i>

05:48.433 --> 05:50.600
<i>I was gone for two seconds, mom.</i>

05:50.636 --> 05:51.101
<i>Geez.</i>

05:51.169 --> 05:52.169
<i>You never call.</i>

05:52.204 --> 05:53.436
<i>You never check my cervix.</i>

05:53.472 --> 05:55.438
<i>I just checked your cervix!</i>

05:55.507 --> 05:56.641
<i>You're six centimeters!</i>

05:56.710 --> 05:58.644
<i>Would it kill you to check again?</i>

05:58.680 --> 06:01.447
<i>It is so much for a mother
to want her son to check her</i>

06:01.482 --> 06:04.283
<i>dilation with regular frequency?</i>

06:04.351 --> 06:05.183
<i>Oh, by the way.</i>

06:05.252 --> 06:08.186
<i>Since you gave me the epidural,
I can't tell if I soiled the</i>

06:08.221 --> 06:10.021
<i>sheets or not.</i>

06:10.090 --> 06:11.356
<i>I can.</i>

06:22.503 --> 06:25.005
<i>Ohh!</i>

06:25.040 --> 06:26.640
<i>Yes!</i>

06:26.709 --> 06:29.642
<i>Shh, shh, shh, shh.</i>

06:31.713 --> 06:34.013
<i>Pistore!</i>

06:34.082 --> 06:37.383
<i>Pistore.</i>

06:41.423 --> 06:43.089
<i>Ugh.</i>

06:45.460 --> 06:48.128
<i>Whoo!</i>

06:48.164 --> 06:50.464
<i>Well, Cat, I got you
a plate of rice and beans.</i>

06:50.499 --> 06:51.298
<i>Best I could do.</i>

06:51.333 --> 06:53.133
<i>I can't believe we're
out of fish tacos.</i>

06:53.168 --> 06:54.100
<i>Just my luck.</i>

06:54.135 --> 06:56.469
<i>I feel like I've been waiting
forever to get my mouth on a</i>

06:56.504 --> 07:00.206
<i>fish taco, and I don't know
if it will ever happen.</i>

07:03.676 --> 07:04.476
<i>Hi.</i>

07:04.545 --> 07:06.211
<i>I know you're hurting right now.</i>

07:06.246 --> 07:07.212
<i>I get</i> it.

07:07.247 --> 07:09.214
I'd like to take you out
for a cup of coffee.

07:09.283 --> 07:10.950
Let me give you my Internet name.

07:10.985 --> 07:12.051
I'm all set up on e-mail.

07:12.086 --> 07:12.952
Whoa!

07:12.987 --> 07:14.020
Excuse me!

07:14.055 --> 07:14.554
Yes?

07:14.589 --> 07:18.224
This is supposed to be a
half-priced hospital for ladies.

07:18.293 --> 07:20.493
Instead, it feels like a pickup joint!

07:20.562 --> 07:21.661
Oh, no, no.

07:21.696 --> 07:23.396
Of course this is a hospital!

07:23.465 --> 07:24.130
Please!

07:24.166 --> 07:25.398
Let's go to my office.

07:25.434 --> 07:27.066
You could put your feet up.

07:27.135 --> 07:29.406
I've got weed.

07:29.475 --> 07:31.975
Ladies night is a sham!

07:32.010 --> 07:33.308
Let's get the hell out of here!

07:33.344 --> 07:34.107
Oh, no.

07:34.142 --> 07:34.704
She's right.

07:34.773 --> 07:35.738
Get away. Come on.

07:35.773 --> 07:36.605
Please don't go!

07:36.640 --> 07:37.506
How about 60% off?

07:37.574 --> 07:38.406
A free mammogram!

07:38.475 --> 07:39.306
Ladies!

07:39.341 --> 07:40.139
Where you going?

07:40.175 --> 07:41.674
The night's just getting started!

07:41.709 --> 07:44.209
Sy's got weed!

07:44.245 --> 07:46.545
Aah! Now push, ma!

07:46.613 --> 07:50.281
I've been pushing out babies since
before you were born -- right before.

07:50.350 --> 07:52.717
You never respect
my professional opinion.

07:52.752 --> 07:54.185
Ow! I think I'm crowning!

07:54.254 --> 07:55.519
Get in there! Push it aside!

07:55.555 --> 07:56.554
I don't want a tear!

07:56.589 --> 07:58.055
I'm gonna be sick.

07:58.091 --> 07:58.989
I'm gonna be sick.

07:59.058 --> 07:59.623
I'm gonna be sick.

07:59.692 --> 08:01.358
Can you see if the baby has any hair?

08:01.427 --> 08:03.994
Honestly, mom, I can't
tell where your massive pubic

08:04.030 --> 08:05.562
thicket ends and the
baby's head begins.

08:05.598 --> 08:06.463
Okay. Here it comes!

08:08.634 --> 08:12.100
This is a nightmare come true!

08:14.104 --> 08:17.206
Hey. It's a girl!

08:17.274 --> 08:19.374
Here comes the placenta!

08:19.443 --> 08:21.377
Huh?

08:21.446 --> 08:22.278
Wait a second.

08:22.313 --> 08:23.012
What?

08:23.048 --> 08:25.081
I'm getting a weird
feeling that you're a lesbian.

08:25.117 --> 08:25.749
You're not?

08:25.784 --> 08:26.750
But you're wearing a belt.

08:26.785 --> 08:29.019
I just thought this
was about sisterhood.

08:30.088 --> 08:30.654
I know.

08:30.689 --> 08:31.988
It's, like, kind of cheesy.

08:32.024 --> 08:32.756
Oh, my God!

08:32.791 --> 08:36.092
I think the fish tacos
were contaminated!

08:36.128 --> 08:38.562
You all have food poisoning!

08:38.630 --> 08:40.530
I'm a physician. I know this.

08:40.566 --> 08:41.565
Let's get you all to a hospital.

08:41.633 --> 08:43.400
My girls can't
afford a hospital.

08:43.434 --> 08:44.668
These are low-income lesbians.

08:44.737 --> 08:47.304
Most hospitals charge twice
as much as they can pay.

08:47.339 --> 08:49.373
Well, I know
just where we can go!

08:49.408 --> 08:50.674
Of course!

08:50.743 --> 08:51.742
Starbucks!

08:51.777 --> 08:52.576
Okay!

08:52.645 --> 08:55.645
But then we'll go
to Childrens, obviously.

09:02.553 --> 09:04.020
Ladies!

09:04.089 --> 09:05.221
Paying customers!

09:05.290 --> 09:07.089
We are back in business!

09:07.125 --> 09:09.091
Preparing!

09:12.296 --> 09:13.596
Let's go, gentlemen!

09:14.632 --> 09:16.365
What are you gonna name her?

09:16.401 --> 09:17.233
Not up to me.

09:17.268 --> 09:18.935
You want me to name her?

09:18.970 --> 09:20.670
Not up to you, either.

09:20.739 --> 09:22.138
Is this her?

09:22.174 --> 09:23.373
Here she is!

09:23.408 --> 09:26.142
Helen, we can't thank you
enough for doing this.

09:26.211 --> 09:27.377
You're a surrogate?!

09:27.412 --> 09:29.011
I had to do something for money.

09:29.046 --> 09:30.679
I'm still paying off your
medical-school fees.

09:30.748 --> 09:32.481
Mom, I can pay off my own loans!

09:32.516 --> 09:34.316
I make six figures a year!

09:34.385 --> 09:38.220
Why couldn't you be a
doctor like your brother?

09:38.255 --> 09:40.689
Well, I'm glad
you stopped vomiting.

09:40.758 --> 09:43.292
Well, you better believe
I won't be having fish

09:43.327 --> 09:45.494
tacos again... for at least three days.

09:45.529 --> 09:48.130
I didn't mean to lead you on.

09:48.165 --> 09:51.400
Of all the low-income
lesbian fish-taco joints, huh?

09:51.435 --> 09:54.437
But you know, I have enjoyed
getting to know you a little

09:54.472 --> 09:55.705
better outside of work.

09:55.740 --> 09:57.073
Yeah, me too.

09:57.109 --> 10:00.710
Thanks.

10:00.779 --> 10:06.416
Cat, you're getting
my purse totally wet.

10:06.452 --> 10:10.153
What are you gonna do about that?

10:10.189 --> 10:12.723
I think when I leaned in to
kiss you, I must have knocked

10:12.792 --> 10:14.057
this glass of water over.

10:14.093 --> 10:15.225
It's really my fault.

10:15.260 --> 10:17.694
I'm so sorry, um...
Um... we -- I'm so sorry.

10:17.730 --> 10:18.528
Yeah, yeah.

10:18.597 --> 10:21.265
Yeah, there's some paper
towels over there.

10:21.300 --> 10:22.499
In the dispenser.

10:22.534 --> 10:23.433
Yeah. That's okay.

10:23.502 --> 10:27.638
I'll -- it'll -- I'm sure I can just
kind of blot it with this blanket.
