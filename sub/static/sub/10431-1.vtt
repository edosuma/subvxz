WEBVTT

01:26.253 --> 01:28.287
Help!

01:28.289 --> 01:29.655
Get away!

01:34.695 --> 01:35.661
Get away!

01:38.699 --> 01:40.666
Get off of me!

02:04.225 --> 02:05.757
Dispatcher : This is an Amber

02:05.759 --> 02:08.794
alert message from the west
Virginia patrol department.

02:08.795 --> 02:13.332
A child abduction occurred at
3:00 pm yesterday in the town

02:13.334 --> 02:15.667
of castle rock, Wyoming county.

02:15.669 --> 02:20.172
The child is seven years
old, brown hair, blue eyes.

02:20.174 --> 02:20.906
This is the third--

02:24.278 --> 02:25.310
this is ridiculous.

02:25.312 --> 02:28.147
There's only one radio station?

02:28.149 --> 02:30.249
Makes it easy.

02:30.251 --> 02:34.386
These child abductions
are giving me the creeps.

02:34.388 --> 02:35.721
We're almost there.

02:35.723 --> 02:37.523
Yeah, right.

02:37.525 --> 02:40.192
You've been saying that for the
past 100 miles, Blake blackman.

02:40.194 --> 02:41.360
Oh, we're in a grumpy mood.

02:41.362 --> 02:42.227
I know.

02:42.229 --> 02:42.928
I'm sorry.

02:42.930 --> 02:45.197
I'm sorry.

02:45.199 --> 02:46.565
This headache is killing me.

02:46.567 --> 02:48.200
We're not far from castle rock.

02:48.202 --> 02:50.802
Maybe we could stop,
grab some lunch.

02:50.804 --> 02:51.670
Oh, babe.

02:51.672 --> 02:52.571
Great.

02:52.573 --> 02:53.539
I have no cell signal.

02:53.541 --> 02:55.207
It's just the area.

02:55.209 --> 02:56.808
Great.

02:56.810 --> 03:00.245
Cabin in the middle of nowhere
with no cell signal, no cable.

03:00.247 --> 03:01.580
And lots of sex.

03:01.582 --> 03:02.414
Hmm.

03:02.416 --> 03:03.582
Promises, promises.

03:13.194 --> 03:14.293
So this is it, right?

03:14.295 --> 03:15.260
This is it, baby.

03:15.262 --> 03:18.430
Castle rock?

03:18.432 --> 03:21.333
Hmm.

03:21.335 --> 03:25.237
Gosh, what happened here?

03:25.239 --> 03:27.439
I guess that's all that's left
after the big mudslide buried

03:27.441 --> 03:29.675
the town a couple of years ago.

03:29.677 --> 03:30.709
It's creepy.

03:30.711 --> 03:31.510
So sad.

03:35.849 --> 03:36.748
Yeah.

03:36.750 --> 03:38.250
Sherman mentioned it.

03:38.252 --> 03:41.820
It's a ghost town.

03:41.822 --> 03:44.723
Looks like we won't
be eating lunch here.

03:49.597 --> 03:51.330
Hey, honey.

03:51.332 --> 03:52.431
Yup.

03:52.433 --> 03:53.732
Almost there.

03:53.734 --> 03:56.935
Yeah, it's pretty nice up here.

03:56.937 --> 03:59.538
I know, it's hit or miss.

03:59.540 --> 04:00.806
Um-hmm.

04:00.808 --> 04:01.740
I'll make sure.

04:08.515 --> 04:10.415
Are you all right?

04:10.416 --> 04:12.316
You're taking your medication.

04:12.319 --> 04:14.486
Clair!

04:14.488 --> 04:15.287
Hello?

04:20.995 --> 04:21.959
What?

04:21.962 --> 04:24.763
She ok?

04:24.765 --> 04:26.331
She stopped taking
her medication.

04:29.670 --> 04:30.469
Why?

04:33.474 --> 04:34.439
She's punishing me.

05:06.507 --> 05:07.339
Hey, hey.

05:07.341 --> 05:08.707
This isn't bad.

05:08.709 --> 05:11.576
Babe, I still don't
have any signal!

05:11.578 --> 05:12.678
This is no good.

05:15.716 --> 05:17.582
I'm telling you, if they
cannot reach me, they're going

05:17.584 --> 05:20.485
to think something is wrong.

05:20.487 --> 05:21.486
Oh, I got it!
I got it!

05:21.488 --> 05:22.087
Yay!

05:26.860 --> 05:28.026
Hey, mom.
Yeah.

05:28.028 --> 05:28.894
Yeah.

05:28.896 --> 05:30.395
I know.

05:30.397 --> 05:31.096
Well, I'm going to be
in meetings all day,

05:31.098 --> 05:32.798
so-- yeah, yeah, yeah.

05:32.800 --> 05:35.801
Um, yeah, mom, you know what?

05:35.803 --> 05:37.602
I gotta go, mom.

05:37.604 --> 05:38.570
Brandi!

05:38.572 --> 05:39.971
Brandi!

05:39.973 --> 05:41.340
Relax, she'll be back.

05:41.342 --> 05:43.108
She lives year-round in a condo.

05:43.110 --> 05:44.943
Now she's free to run around.

05:44.945 --> 05:47.045
Don't worry, she'll be back.

05:47.047 --> 05:48.013
Hey, come on.

05:48.015 --> 05:48.880
Let me show you the cabin.

05:48.882 --> 05:50.048
What about the bags?

05:50.050 --> 05:51.516
Well, we'll get the bags.
Come on.

05:51.518 --> 05:52.684
-Are you sure?
-Let me show you this.

05:52.686 --> 05:53.585
You'll love it.

05:58.992 --> 06:00.459
Damn, woman.

06:00.461 --> 06:01.560
Home, sweet home.

06:01.562 --> 06:04.029
Very funny.

06:04.031 --> 06:05.063
So what do you think?

06:05.065 --> 06:06.465
This is actually kind of cute.

06:06.467 --> 06:07.766
Uh-huh.

06:07.768 --> 06:09.401
Ah, look at sherman
and his little cabin.

06:09.403 --> 06:10.769
Yeah, sherman was right.

06:10.771 --> 06:12.704
I told you.

06:12.706 --> 06:14.406
Ok.
Honey.

06:14.408 --> 06:15.440
What?

06:15.442 --> 06:17.142
I love you, but not right now.

06:17.144 --> 06:18.009
Why not?

06:18.011 --> 06:18.944
What's-- what's up?

06:18.946 --> 06:20.078
Are you kidding me?

06:20.080 --> 06:21.680
That dog is the
only thing I have.

06:21.682 --> 06:23.749
What about me?

06:23.751 --> 06:25.951
Seriously?

06:25.953 --> 06:26.952
Brandi?

06:26.954 --> 06:29.488
Brandi!

06:39.833 --> 06:40.799
Brandi, girl!

07:13.600 --> 07:14.499
I don't get it.

07:14.501 --> 07:16.902
She's never done this.

07:16.904 --> 07:19.905
She has never, ever
run away before.

07:19.907 --> 07:22.174
I know.

07:22.176 --> 07:24.576
We'll just have to wait.

07:31.885 --> 07:35.587
It's gonna be ok, I promise.

07:35.589 --> 07:38.590
If not, we'll-- we'll go out
first thing in the morning.

07:43.964 --> 07:48.667
I'm gonna take a bath.

09:23.330 --> 09:24.162
Blake?

09:31.772 --> 09:34.306
Blake!

09:34.308 --> 09:35.106
Blake!

09:45.786 --> 09:46.585
Honey!

09:53.627 --> 09:54.225
Honey?

10:01.134 --> 10:04.102
Blake?

10:04.104 --> 10:05.070
Ah!

10:05.072 --> 10:06.771
I hate you!

10:06.773 --> 10:07.672
What?

10:07.674 --> 10:08.940
That's not funny.

10:08.942 --> 10:10.108
Just stupido.
Seriously--

10:10.110 --> 10:11.343
-no, it's not.
- --It wasn't funny.

10:11.345 --> 10:13.078
It's, I don't know,
kind of exciting.

10:13.080 --> 10:13.912
No.

10:13.914 --> 10:14.913
I like it.

10:14.915 --> 10:15.747
Yes, you do.

10:15.749 --> 10:18.083
Stop it.

10:18.085 --> 10:19.618
Stop it..

10:35.035 --> 10:35.867
Blake.

10:35.869 --> 10:36.801
Blake.

10:36.803 --> 10:38.136
Huh.

10:38.138 --> 10:39.638
Did you hear that?

10:39.640 --> 10:41.706
It's the wind.

10:41.708 --> 10:43.408
No, it's not.

10:43.410 --> 10:45.310
I'm goin' downstairs.

10:45.312 --> 10:46.111
Oh.

10:50.384 --> 10:51.383
Brandi!

10:55.922 --> 10:56.888
Brandi, girl!

11:00.293 --> 11:02.027
Come here, girl!

11:02.029 --> 11:02.827
Brandi?

11:07.668 --> 11:08.266
Come here, girl.

11:13.674 --> 11:14.305
Come here, girl.

11:49.443 --> 11:50.475
You little thief.

11:54.047 --> 11:55.413
Come here.

11:56.383 --> 11:59.084
Hey, you.

11:59.086 --> 11:59.918
Babe!

11:59.920 --> 12:01.886
Guess who's back?

12:01.888 --> 12:02.854
Come here, girl.

12:02.856 --> 12:03.822
There's your mommy.

12:04.791 --> 12:06.791
Come here, girl!

12:06.793 --> 12:07.726
I'm so happy.

12:07.728 --> 12:09.027
I'm gonna kill you.

12:09.029 --> 12:10.829
She-- she smells.

12:10.831 --> 12:11.796
Yes, she does.

12:11.798 --> 12:13.098
Hmm, what happened to her?

12:13.100 --> 12:13.932
I don't know.

12:13.934 --> 12:14.966
She's soaking wet.

12:14.968 --> 12:16.201
Hmm.

12:16.203 --> 12:17.168
I'm going to have
to give her a bath.

12:17.170 --> 12:18.169
Hey, baby.

12:18.171 --> 12:20.505
Aren't you glad she's back?

12:24.945 --> 12:25.877
What's wrong?

12:25.879 --> 12:26.978
Nothing.

12:26.980 --> 12:28.012
Nothing.

12:28.014 --> 12:30.248
I'm just gonna give her a bath.

12:30.250 --> 12:32.016
So is it ok in
sherman's bathroom?

12:32.018 --> 12:33.251
-Sure.
-Are you sure?

12:33.253 --> 12:34.519
Sherman's not here.
I won't tell him.

12:34.521 --> 12:35.386
You won't tell him?

12:35.388 --> 12:36.888
Uh-uh, promise.

12:36.890 --> 12:37.822
Come here, girl.

12:37.824 --> 12:38.757
Come here, girl.

12:38.759 --> 12:41.326
Hey, girl.

12:41.328 --> 12:42.861
I'm gonna kill you.

12:52.806 --> 12:53.438
Babe!

12:53.440 --> 12:56.374
It's sherman!

12:56.376 --> 12:58.343
Babe!

12:58.345 --> 12:59.177
Stay.

12:59.179 --> 13:00.345
Brandi, stay.

13:21.234 --> 13:22.033
Hey, sherman.

13:24.571 --> 13:26.404
Your place is great.

13:26.406 --> 13:28.306
So how's the writing.

13:28.308 --> 13:32.944
It's, uh, comin' along.

13:32.946 --> 13:34.145
Good.

13:34.147 --> 13:35.580
We're gonna need
something from you soon.

13:35.582 --> 13:37.115
We're already working
on a book cover.

13:37.117 --> 13:38.449
Keep me updated, ok?

13:38.451 --> 13:40.084
Sure.

13:40.086 --> 13:41.085
Give me a couple days.

13:41.087 --> 13:42.153
Uh, I'll give you a call.

14:01.308 --> 14:03.208
Is sherman gonna be worried
that you're not writing?

14:03.210 --> 14:06.044
Ah, sherman needs
to get over it.

14:06.046 --> 14:09.047
You're gonna be in
trouble with sherman.

14:09.049 --> 14:12.016
Ah, trouble with sherman--
trouble with sherman.

14:12.018 --> 14:14.118
I got trouble with you is
who I've got trouble with.

14:18.091 --> 14:22.460
Texting the wrong guy
can be very dangerous.

14:25.899 --> 14:29.400
You gonna be a good girl, hmm?

14:29.402 --> 14:35.340
Stop!

14:46.019 --> 14:47.886
What?

14:47.888 --> 14:51.089
The writing?

14:51.091 --> 14:54.259
You're just feeling the
pressure 'cause sherman called.

14:54.261 --> 14:57.662
Angie, I haven't been able to
write a decent first page yet,

14:57.664 --> 14:59.931
and they already
have the book cover.

14:59.933 --> 15:02.667
I used to be so good at this.

15:02.669 --> 15:04.435
You're cracking me up.

15:04.437 --> 15:06.304
You're still good at this.

15:06.306 --> 15:07.305
Unexaggerated.

15:07.307 --> 15:08.573
Here.
Your favorite.

15:08.575 --> 15:09.374
So you get inspired.

15:12.679 --> 15:14.212
Ah, thank you.

15:14.214 --> 15:15.914
You're welcome.

15:15.916 --> 15:19.183
What really inspires me is
the chef, not the pancakes.

15:19.185 --> 15:20.218
Oh.

15:20.220 --> 15:21.319
Great compliments this morning.

15:21.321 --> 15:22.153
Thank you.

15:22.155 --> 15:24.122
Mmm.

15:24.124 --> 15:25.556
Brandi, come here.

15:26.693 --> 15:28.526
So, uh, how's the runaway?

15:28.528 --> 15:29.494
He's ok.

15:29.496 --> 15:30.929
He's just driving me nuts.

15:30.931 --> 15:31.996
She wants to go out
all the time now.

15:31.998 --> 15:33.531
No way.
I'm not risking it.

15:33.533 --> 15:36.401
Put her on a leash.

15:36.403 --> 15:39.337
Yeah, I guess.

15:39.339 --> 15:41.239
She's fixated with the
ball that she brought.

15:41.241 --> 15:43.241
Did you see it?

15:43.243 --> 15:44.142
No.

15:44.144 --> 15:45.009
She's obsessed about it.

15:45.011 --> 15:46.644
Where'd she find it?

15:46.646 --> 15:48.646
In the woods, I guess.

15:48.648 --> 15:50.648
Come here, you.

15:50.650 --> 15:52.517
When you goin' into town?

15:52.519 --> 15:54.252
Not today, maybe tomorrow.

15:54.254 --> 15:57.655
I think I'm going
to do some sketches

15:57.657 --> 15:59.590
for that client of mine.

15:59.592 --> 16:01.192
And I still have
those headaches.

16:01.194 --> 16:02.627
I'm kind of worried.

16:02.629 --> 16:05.563
Why don't you go have
a doctor check it out?

16:05.565 --> 16:06.431
Where?

16:06.433 --> 16:08.399
In ghost town?

16:08.401 --> 16:12.003
You'll be able to
find somebody in there.

16:12.005 --> 16:14.305
I guess.

16:14.307 --> 16:17.175
Maybe tomorrow when
i go for groceries.

16:24.017 --> 16:25.383
Go get it, girl.

16:27.721 --> 16:29.220
Good girl.

16:29.222 --> 16:30.054
Come here.

16:30.056 --> 16:31.656
Good girl!

16:31.658 --> 16:32.690
Go!

16:36.596 --> 16:37.562
Good girl.

16:37.564 --> 16:39.130
Give it to me.

16:39.132 --> 16:40.098
Ready?

16:40.100 --> 16:41.065
Go!

16:41.067 --> 16:43.534
Go get it!

16:43.536 --> 16:44.369
Go!

16:47.073 --> 16:48.072
What are you looking at?

17:02.655 --> 17:04.655
Babe!

17:04.656 --> 17:05.656
Hey!

17:05.657 --> 17:07.657
Babe!

17:07.660 --> 17:08.593
Babe!

17:08.595 --> 17:09.426
Babe!

17:09.429 --> 17:10.795
What's wrong?

17:10.797 --> 17:11.695
-There's someone out there!
-What do you mean!

17:11.698 --> 17:13.196
I swear!

17:13.199 --> 17:14.132
Someone-- someone threw
the ball back at me!

17:14.134 --> 17:14.766
Where's Brandi?

17:14.768 --> 17:17.402
She's gone!

17:27.280 --> 17:28.679
Nothin'.

17:28.681 --> 17:30.615
Blake, I'm telling you.

17:30.617 --> 17:32.116
Someone is out there.

17:32.118 --> 17:33.184
I threw the ball and
someone threw the ball

17:33.186 --> 17:34.318
back at me from the woods!

17:34.320 --> 17:35.520
I don't have time.

17:35.522 --> 17:36.754
I need to go back
inside and write!

17:36.756 --> 17:38.256
You don't give a damn, do you?

17:38.258 --> 17:39.323
What do you want
from me, Angie?

17:39.325 --> 17:40.158
I searched!

17:40.160 --> 17:41.459
There's nothing!

17:41.461 --> 17:42.693
I told you to keep that
damn dog on a leash!

17:42.695 --> 17:44.195
You know what?

17:44.197 --> 17:47.365
Forget it.

17:47.367 --> 17:48.533
Come on.

17:51.704 --> 17:54.238
What are you doing?

17:54.240 --> 17:55.239
Angie, it's getting dark!

18:01.581 --> 18:02.413
Brandi!

18:32.545 --> 18:33.578
Who is that?

18:38.618 --> 18:41.185
Brandi!
Just come here!

18:41.187 --> 18:42.353
Oh, my god, girl!

18:48.495 --> 18:53.297
Oh, Brandi, I'm gonna kill you!

18:53.299 --> 18:56.234
Come here, girl.

18:56.236 --> 18:57.602
Where were you?

19:09.182 --> 19:10.148
How's your headache?

19:10.150 --> 19:10.748
Any better?

19:14.220 --> 19:15.820
What's that?

19:15.822 --> 19:17.221
Nothing.

19:17.223 --> 19:18.723
Something I'm working on.

19:18.725 --> 19:20.258
Look, I'm sorry.

19:20.260 --> 19:20.892
I suck.

19:20.894 --> 19:22.460
Yeah, you do.

19:22.462 --> 19:24.295
I-- I just think the
pressure's getting to me.

19:24.297 --> 19:26.564
--What are you
talking about, Blake?

19:26.566 --> 19:27.598
You're a great writer.

19:27.600 --> 19:28.399
You'll be able to write again.

19:28.401 --> 19:29.300
I mean about us.

19:32.739 --> 19:35.306
I've been thinking.

19:35.308 --> 19:37.308
It's time.

19:37.310 --> 19:39.744
We just can't do this anymore.

19:39.746 --> 19:40.545
We can't.

19:44.384 --> 19:45.416
It's not fair to her.

19:45.418 --> 19:46.884
It's not fair to me.

19:46.886 --> 19:48.819
You can't choose who
you fall in love with.

19:48.821 --> 19:56.594
But still, I feel so empty, as
if I haven't achieved anything

19:56.596 --> 19:57.895
meaningful in my life yet.

19:57.897 --> 19:59.664
You're one of the best
illustrators I know.

19:59.666 --> 20:02.633
I'm average.

20:02.635 --> 20:04.602
An average book
illustrator having

20:04.604 --> 20:05.703
an affair with a married guy.

20:08.541 --> 20:14.412
You know what-- what's
the sad part about this

20:14.414 --> 20:16.681
is I was one of
those women who would

20:16.683 --> 20:18.449
say I would never do that.

20:18.451 --> 20:22.987
And here I am doing it.

20:22.989 --> 20:25.523
If my mom only knew.

20:25.525 --> 20:26.857
Hey.

20:26.859 --> 20:29.493
Listen to me.

20:29.495 --> 20:31.462
I'm crazy about you.

20:31.464 --> 20:32.263
Come here.

20:38.972 --> 20:40.671
I'm gonna make this right.

20:40.673 --> 20:41.472
How?

21:28.421 --> 21:29.320
I'm leaving.

21:29.322 --> 21:30.288
I'm going to the store.

21:30.290 --> 21:31.522
Do I want anything?

21:31.524 --> 21:33.557
Yeah, maybe a bottle of wine.

21:33.559 --> 21:34.759
Ok.

21:34.761 --> 21:37.328
Don't forget to stop for gas.

21:37.330 --> 21:40.298
Can you make sure Brandi
doesn't get out, please.

21:42.935 --> 21:43.768
Ok, I'm going.

21:43.770 --> 21:46.971
Love you.

21:46.973 --> 21:49.040
Love you too.

21:49.042 --> 21:50.808
And follow the GPS.

21:50.810 --> 21:51.676
Ok.

21:51.678 --> 21:54.845
I will.

21:54.847 --> 21:55.813
Good girl.

21:55.815 --> 21:57.548
Good girl.

21:57.550 --> 21:58.382
Stay.

21:58.384 --> 21:59.350
You stay.

22:09.996 --> 22:11.629
--This is Claire blackman.

22:11.631 --> 22:14.398
Leave your name and
number at the beep.

22:14.400 --> 22:18.536
Claire, it's me.

22:18.538 --> 22:20.504
Call me when you get this.

22:20.506 --> 22:21.105
It's important.

22:26.446 --> 22:28.646
Listen, I know things haven't
been great with us lately.

22:33.086 --> 22:35.453
We need to talk.

22:35.455 --> 22:39.890
I've done something--
something I'm not proud of.

22:51.437 --> 22:53.037
Ma'am, I need you to
sign the last page.

22:53.039 --> 22:54.405
You forgot to sign it.
Thanks.

22:54.407 --> 22:55.706
Authorities declined

22:55.708 --> 22:57.541
to go on camera that
in a statement released

22:57.543 --> 23:00.010
this morning, sheriff
Albert McFadden announced

23:00.012 --> 23:02.113
that no leads have
developed, nor have

23:02.115 --> 23:04.682
any suspects been targeted.

23:04.684 --> 23:07.785
8-year-old Tobias Barrett
disappeared on his way home

23:07.787 --> 23:09.420
from castle rock park.

23:09.422 --> 23:11.689
Families throughout the
county are on guard,

23:11.691 --> 23:15.459
as this is now the third missing
child case in the castle rock

23:15.461 --> 23:17.428
area in the last 18 months.

23:22.635 --> 23:25.770
Anjet-- Angelica santoro.

23:25.772 --> 23:28.472
Yes.

23:28.474 --> 23:29.407
Follow me.

23:33.179 --> 23:37.448
And you said your last
period was when, Mrs. santoro?

23:37.450 --> 23:38.082
Miss.

23:38.084 --> 23:40.151
I'm not married.

23:40.153 --> 23:42.019
Months ago.

23:42.021 --> 23:43.053
July, maybe.

23:43.055 --> 23:45.756
My cycles are very irregular.

23:45.758 --> 23:48.426
Well, seems you're
about 12 weeks pregnant.

23:51.898 --> 23:52.696
What?

23:59.005 --> 24:00.638
That's impossible.

24:00.640 --> 24:03.073
No, it isn't.

24:03.075 --> 24:05.543
You're three months pregnant.

24:05.545 --> 24:06.610
Nature works miracles.

24:10.616 --> 24:13.951
Have you had any recreational
drugs during this period?

24:18.124 --> 24:21.959
I-- I can't be.

24:21.961 --> 24:23.227
I have acute fibroids.

24:26.699 --> 24:28.799
The doctors say i
can never have a baby

24:28.801 --> 24:31.635
or get pregnant, unless
i went through invitro.

24:31.637 --> 24:34.839
Well, it looks like
they were wrong.

24:34.841 --> 24:35.906
Congratulations.

24:35.908 --> 24:36.874
No.

24:36.876 --> 24:39.910
No, you don't understand.

24:39.912 --> 24:41.078
I cannot have this baby.

24:41.080 --> 24:43.481
I'm not married.

24:43.483 --> 24:48.519
The father is-- it's
just not the right time.

24:51.224 --> 24:54.825
Blake's gonna kill
me when he finds out.

24:54.827 --> 24:57.228
You take it easy.

24:57.230 --> 25:00.030
We'll forward the results of
your test to your physician.

25:00.032 --> 25:01.765
You follow through with him.

25:01.767 --> 25:06.070
Miss louann will give you
some prenatal vitamins.

25:20.219 --> 25:22.686
Take your time.

28:43.756 --> 28:44.455
Emergency.

28:44.457 --> 28:45.222
What is your location?

28:45.224 --> 28:46.090
Location?

28:46.092 --> 28:46.924
I don't know.

28:46.926 --> 28:47.858
Wyoming county.

28:47.860 --> 28:48.859
It's an emergency.

28:48.861 --> 28:50.427
My name is Angelica santoro.

28:50.429 --> 28:53.163
Hello?

28:53.165 --> 28:53.964
Shit.

29:54.093 --> 29:55.993
Hey, babe, it's me.

29:55.995 --> 29:59.029
I'm worried.

29:59.031 --> 30:00.531
You were on your way
home about an hour ago.

30:04.236 --> 30:05.035
Call me.

30:15.314 --> 30:17.915
Your call
cannot be completed as dialed.

30:17.917 --> 30:18.882
Please check--

33:35.447 --> 33:37.014
who the hell is that?

33:42.721 --> 33:43.687
Get the dogs.

33:48.427 --> 33:49.393
Come on!

34:08.781 --> 34:11.380
Ah!

34:36.708 --> 34:39.543
911, can I help you?

34:39.545 --> 34:40.510
Hello.

34:40.512 --> 34:42.179
My name is Blake blackman.

34:42.181 --> 34:43.780
I'd like to report the
disappearance of my girlfriend.

34:49.588 --> 34:53.156
This is your
fault. She followed you!

34:53.158 --> 34:54.157
Did you go into town?

34:54.159 --> 34:55.559
Well, I told you not to!

34:55.561 --> 34:56.525
Are you demented woman?

34:56.527 --> 34:58.528
I had a flat tire!

35:05.838 --> 35:07.437
They don't be looking for him.

35:07.439 --> 35:09.406
They don't be looking for him.

35:09.408 --> 35:10.440
I have.

35:10.442 --> 35:11.241
Shh.

35:13.679 --> 35:14.578
Who are you?

35:14.580 --> 35:15.378
Who's there?

35:18.317 --> 35:19.116
Us.

35:22.621 --> 35:23.553
Who's us?

35:27.259 --> 35:29.559
When was the last
time you saw her, sir?

35:29.561 --> 35:31.361
About 9 o'clock this morning.

35:31.363 --> 35:34.664
She went into town to get some
groceries and to see a doctor.

35:34.666 --> 35:35.765
What doctor?

35:35.767 --> 35:39.136
She wasn't feeling well.

35:39.138 --> 35:39.903
You got any pictures of her?

35:39.905 --> 35:40.904
No.

35:40.906 --> 35:42.873
No pictures.

35:42.875 --> 35:45.475
Not even on your cell?

35:45.477 --> 35:46.543
No.

35:46.545 --> 35:48.411
Did she contact
you at all, sir?

35:48.413 --> 35:50.881
Yeah, actually, she
texted me around noon

35:50.883 --> 35:53.150
and told me that
she was coming back.

35:53.152 --> 35:54.384
May I see some ID, please.

36:02.261 --> 36:04.594
New York.

36:04.596 --> 36:05.695
We don't get
tourists around here.

36:05.697 --> 36:07.197
We're not.

36:07.199 --> 36:09.232
I'm a writer and she's
a book illustrator.

36:09.234 --> 36:10.734
My editor in new
York owns the cabin.

36:10.736 --> 36:13.737
His name is sherman Rogers,
and I'm using his place

36:13.739 --> 36:15.172
to work on my next novel.

36:15.174 --> 36:16.439
What do you write?

36:16.441 --> 36:17.374
Horror novels.

36:21.246 --> 36:24.447
You mind if we
take a look around?

36:24.449 --> 36:27.284
Yeah, sure.

36:42.267 --> 36:44.234
Hey, Steve.

36:44.236 --> 36:45.569
Take a look at this.

36:55.280 --> 36:56.346
This guy's hiding something.

37:04.489 --> 37:05.522
Mr. blackman?

37:05.524 --> 37:07.490
Did you send for other units?

37:07.492 --> 37:09.526
I'm gonna have to ask
you to come to the station

37:09.528 --> 37:10.961
with us, mr blackman.
-The station?

37:10.963 --> 37:12.429
What are you kidding me?

37:12.431 --> 37:13.563
Why aren't you out
there looking for her?

37:13.565 --> 37:15.332
Sir, we understand
you're upset,

37:15.334 --> 37:16.666
but you're going to have to
file a missing persons report.

37:23.375 --> 37:24.674
Well, come on, then.
Let's go.

37:24.676 --> 37:25.875
How much more time
you gonna waste?

37:30.549 --> 37:32.582
Nancy, what are you
still doing here?

37:39.658 --> 37:40.657
Sir.

37:40.659 --> 37:42.359
I'm already home, Thompson.

37:42.361 --> 37:42.959
We've got a situation.

38:00.746 --> 38:01.711
Finally.

38:01.713 --> 38:02.612
What the hell's going on?

38:02.614 --> 38:03.880
Sir, please take a seat.

38:03.882 --> 38:05.815
I've been sitting on
my ass long enough.

38:05.817 --> 38:06.916
Why are you wasting time?

38:06.918 --> 38:09.019
Calm down, Mr. blackman.

38:09.021 --> 38:10.887
I'm sheriff McFadden.

38:10.889 --> 38:13.923
I think we need to talk.

38:13.925 --> 38:15.425
Ok, sheriff.

38:15.427 --> 38:17.394
Let's talk.

38:17.396 --> 38:19.562
Why aren't you out there
searching for my girlfriend?

38:19.564 --> 38:21.031
I already told you
everything I know.

38:21.033 --> 38:22.432
Hey!

38:22.434 --> 38:23.066
Take it easy.

38:23.068 --> 38:24.501
It's ok, Thompson.

38:24.503 --> 38:25.969
No, you didn't.

38:25.971 --> 38:28.938
Your background check came back.

38:28.940 --> 38:32.842
You're a married man, Mr.
blackman, to Claire borts.

38:32.844 --> 38:34.477
What difference does that make?

38:34.479 --> 38:35.512
You liked to the police.

38:35.514 --> 38:37.380
I didn't lie.

38:37.382 --> 38:40.450
I just-- yes, I'll
married and I'm

38:40.452 --> 38:41.451
having an affair with Angie.

38:41.453 --> 38:43.386
But that's private.

38:43.388 --> 38:44.821
What really matters
is you guys going

38:44.823 --> 38:46.723
out there and finding her.

38:46.725 --> 38:51.594
See, telling the truth
wasn't that hard, now, was it?

38:51.596 --> 38:53.730
Why don't we start all over?

38:53.732 --> 38:55.365
And this time you
tell us everything.

38:58.670 --> 39:02.505
Angelica santoro.

39:02.507 --> 39:09.346
Mmm, 35-- 35 years old.

39:09.648 --> 39:12.549
Florida driver's license.

39:12.551 --> 39:15.719
We met a year ago at one of
my book signings in New York.

39:15.721 --> 39:17.754
She's an illustrator.

39:17.756 --> 39:20.023
And my editor, sherman
Rogers introduced us.

39:20.025 --> 39:21.891
What are you doing down here?

39:21.893 --> 39:23.393
I'm working on my next novel.

39:23.395 --> 39:25.061
Anybody know you're
here together?

39:25.063 --> 39:26.996
Nobody knows.

39:26.998 --> 39:28.598
What about her family.

39:28.600 --> 39:30.033
Her mother lives
in Miami and thinks

39:30.035 --> 39:32.469
she's in Chicago for work.

39:32.471 --> 39:33.670
Anything else?

39:36.508 --> 39:39.843
Mr. blackman,
answer the question.

39:45.550 --> 39:49.619
When we arrived, she
was playing with the dog

39:49.621 --> 39:52.489
and she swore somebody
was out there.

39:52.491 --> 39:53.123
Where?

39:53.125 --> 39:54.891
In the woods.

39:54.893 --> 39:58.928
And we even argued about it
because I didn't believe her.

39:58.930 --> 40:01.498
Did it become physical at all?

40:04.803 --> 40:07.137
No.

40:07.139 --> 40:09.539
What are we gonna do?

40:09.541 --> 40:11.040
We gonna get rid of her.

40:11.042 --> 40:12.575
Let me go!

40:12.577 --> 40:14.110
Send all units first
thing in the morning

40:14.112 --> 40:15.545
and search the entire county.

40:15.547 --> 40:16.579
Are you kidding me?

40:16.581 --> 40:18.782
Why not tonight?

40:18.784 --> 40:20.950
The officers will
take you back.

40:20.952 --> 40:23.186
If she hadn't
appeared by morning,

40:23.188 --> 40:24.821
we're going to have
to notify the family.

40:24.823 --> 40:29.159
Sheriff, tomorrow
maybe too late.

40:29.161 --> 40:29.959
Thompson.

40:37.903 --> 40:38.701
Angie!

40:41.039 --> 40:41.838
Angie!

40:44.776 --> 40:45.575
Angie!

40:48.146 --> 40:48.978
Angie!

40:52.017 --> 40:54.584
Angie!

41:02.594 --> 41:04.093
Blake?

41:04.095 --> 41:05.094
Blake?

41:05.096 --> 41:06.663
Sherman, we've got to talk.

41:06.665 --> 41:09.466
Remember Angelica,
Angelica santoro?

41:09.468 --> 41:10.200
The book illustrator?

41:10.202 --> 41:11.234
Yeah.

41:11.236 --> 41:12.836
We've been seeing each other.

41:12.838 --> 41:14.671
But I thought you said
there was nothing to that.

41:14.673 --> 41:16.039
I lied.

41:16.041 --> 41:17.874
We've been having an
affair for the past year.

41:17.876 --> 41:21.244
I brought her up here
with me to the cabin.

41:21.246 --> 41:22.779
Now she's gone.

41:22.781 --> 41:23.780
She's missing.

41:23.782 --> 41:24.914
What do you mean by missing?

41:24.916 --> 41:25.849
Come on, sherman.

41:25.851 --> 41:27.684
She's missing!

41:27.686 --> 41:29.619
She went out this
morning to town.

41:29.621 --> 41:30.987
She never came back.

41:30.989 --> 41:32.222
I called the police.

41:32.224 --> 41:33.857
They're searching for her now.

41:33.859 --> 41:36.726
I filed a missing
persons report.

41:36.728 --> 41:40.029
Sherman, if anything
happens to her--

41:40.031 --> 41:41.498
well, wait a second.

41:41.500 --> 41:43.066
You're telling me
that you took this girl

41:43.068 --> 41:44.934
with you up to West Virginia.

41:44.936 --> 41:46.703
And now something may
have happened to her?

41:46.705 --> 41:48.271
-And there's something else.
-What?

41:48.273 --> 41:50.173
They think I may have
done something to her.

41:50.175 --> 41:51.941
Like foul play?

41:51.943 --> 41:53.710
This isn't good.

41:53.712 --> 41:56.813
You're gonna need an attorney.

41:56.815 --> 41:57.647
Don't go anywhere.

41:57.649 --> 41:58.615
I'll call you back.

42:48.333 --> 42:49.132
Angie!

42:53.305 --> 42:54.103
Angie!

43:01.279 --> 43:02.078
Angie!

43:48.360 --> 43:50.727
You best be telling
the truth now, you hear!

43:50.729 --> 43:52.662
I swear no one else is here!

43:52.664 --> 43:53.296
No one else.

43:53.298 --> 43:54.197
No.

43:54.199 --> 43:55.231
I swear, it was just me.

43:55.233 --> 43:56.065
I swear.

43:56.067 --> 43:56.899
Let me go.

43:56.901 --> 43:58.067
Please let me go.

43:58.069 --> 44:00.036
Well, dang, what
are we gonna do?

44:00.038 --> 44:02.238
We gonna kill her.

44:02.240 --> 44:03.106
No!

44:03.108 --> 44:04.641
Please!

44:04.643 --> 44:05.942
I'm p-- I'm pregnant.

44:05.944 --> 44:07.010
Have mercy, please.

44:07.012 --> 44:09.312
Ah!

44:09.314 --> 44:11.180
You think
we stupid people?

44:11.182 --> 44:12.749
You think we dumb, huh?

44:12.751 --> 44:14.283
Is that what you think?

44:14.285 --> 44:16.819
My purse.

44:16.821 --> 44:17.787
Look in my purse.

44:17.789 --> 44:21.124
In my purse..

44:29.668 --> 44:30.700
So what!

44:30.702 --> 44:32.001
We still gotta get rid of her!

44:32.003 --> 44:32.835
But wait.

44:32.837 --> 44:33.670
Wait!

44:33.672 --> 44:34.837
I've got me an idea.

44:34.839 --> 44:35.672
No, Margaret.

44:35.674 --> 44:36.339
No more ideas!

44:36.341 --> 44:38.107
No ideas!

44:38.109 --> 44:41.377
But we could keep her a couple
months till the baby's born,

44:41.379 --> 44:43.780
and get rid of her.

44:43.782 --> 44:45.081
No!

44:45.083 --> 44:47.450
But what if it's
a boy, Leonard.

44:47.452 --> 44:50.319
We could keep him
and get rid of her.

44:50.321 --> 44:52.321
They gonna be lookin' for her.

44:52.323 --> 44:55.224
We ain't gonna do nothin'
of the kind, Margaret.

44:55.226 --> 44:57.160
Leonard cunnings!

44:57.162 --> 44:59.729
You knows what I always wanted.

45:03.702 --> 45:04.867
You got two boys already!

45:04.869 --> 45:06.936
What you want another one for?

45:06.938 --> 45:08.204
No, we ain't gonna
discuss this now!

45:08.206 --> 45:09.005
We ain't!

45:12.711 --> 45:13.409
Mr. Rogers.

45:13.411 --> 45:14.310
What!

45:14.312 --> 45:16.245
Mr. Rogers!

45:16.247 --> 45:17.080
What is it?

45:19.784 --> 45:21.317
I've got Claire
blackman on the phone.

45:21.319 --> 45:23.286
She says it's urgent.

45:23.288 --> 45:25.054
Put her on the phone and
close the door behind you.

45:25.056 --> 45:26.122
Yes, sir.

45:26.124 --> 45:28.224
Where the hell's
my.

45:28.226 --> 45:29.726
Get me Kaufman on the phone.

45:29.728 --> 45:30.893
Tell him it's urgent.
It can't wait.

45:30.895 --> 45:31.494
Ok.

45:37.836 --> 45:39.869
Claire?

45:39.871 --> 45:40.503
I know.

45:40.505 --> 45:41.804
I spoke with him.

45:41.806 --> 45:43.206
It's bad.

45:43.208 --> 45:45.775
He went up there with
someone, Claire-- a woman.

45:48.947 --> 45:50.279
Yes, her.

45:50.281 --> 45:52.448
The girl went missing,
and they can't find her.

45:52.450 --> 45:54.183
He had to file a
missing persons report.

46:04.362 --> 46:05.361
Ow.

46:05.363 --> 46:06.195
I know it hurts.

46:06.197 --> 46:07.029
Hold on.

46:08.533 --> 46:13.770
It's gonna make you feel a
lot better-- so much better.

46:13.772 --> 46:14.771
Trust me.

46:21.212 --> 46:23.146
Put your arm in that one.

46:31.022 --> 46:31.854
There we go.

46:37.028 --> 46:39.962
Where are ya?

46:39.964 --> 46:42.365
Where's your-- yeah.

46:42.367 --> 46:43.933
I got your mouth right there.

46:43.935 --> 46:45.468
Come on.

46:45.470 --> 46:46.269
Uh-uh!

46:49.240 --> 46:51.440
Don't be a damn fool!

46:51.442 --> 46:54.210
You want your baby
to live, don't ya?

46:57.448 --> 46:59.015
Can I have some?

46:59.017 --> 47:02.051
Shut up!

47:02.053 --> 47:05.822
If you want to eat
today, best be quiet!

47:05.824 --> 47:06.489
Come on.

47:06.491 --> 47:07.590
Uh-uh!

47:07.592 --> 47:09.058
Well, suit yourself!

47:11.496 --> 47:13.529
Let me take this thing off.

47:20.004 --> 47:23.005
Look at me.

47:23.007 --> 47:25.441
Look at me.

47:25.443 --> 47:26.242
Oh.

47:29.180 --> 47:31.047
You are so purty.

47:34.519 --> 47:38.855
Oh, you're going to give
me a beautiful baby!

47:38.857 --> 47:41.390
Oh!

47:41.392 --> 47:42.191
Oh!

47:47.565 --> 47:50.199
And I don't want to hear
a peep out of anybody!

48:03.481 --> 48:05.081
Don't cry.

48:05.083 --> 48:06.282
They don't like us crying.

48:10.288 --> 48:12.121
What's your name?

48:12.123 --> 48:13.389
Emmett.

48:13.391 --> 48:14.924
He's Jamie.

48:14.926 --> 48:16.626
Shut up, Emmett.

48:16.628 --> 48:18.194
Why?

48:18.196 --> 48:20.329
I'm not gonna hurt
you, I promise.

48:20.331 --> 48:24.634
There was another boy, but
Leonard took him to the lagoon

48:24.636 --> 48:26.168
after he tried to escape.

48:26.170 --> 48:28.070
The lagoon?

48:28.072 --> 48:30.306
In the back of the property.

48:30.308 --> 48:32.041
He never came back.

48:32.043 --> 48:36.579
You mean-- oh my god.

48:36.581 --> 48:37.413
Oh my god.

48:37.415 --> 48:38.214
Oh my god.

48:53.164 --> 48:54.263
Sherman, I'm losing it.

48:54.265 --> 48:56.132
Blake, listen up.

48:56.134 --> 48:57.300
I'm here with Eric Kaufman.

48:57.302 --> 48:59.402
I want you to listen
very carefully.

48:59.404 --> 49:02.238
Write this name down.

49:02.240 --> 49:04.206
This is an old friend of
mine who lives down there.

49:04.208 --> 49:06.375
We used to go hunting together.

49:06.377 --> 49:09.145
He worked for the police
department many years ago.

49:09.147 --> 49:11.347
Are you ready?

49:11.349 --> 49:18.287
Melbourne 304-556-7889.

49:20.725 --> 49:21.657
And one more thing.

49:25.163 --> 49:26.329
Your wife called.

49:26.331 --> 49:27.163
Great.

49:27.165 --> 49:29.598
When?

49:29.600 --> 49:33.102
I kind of told her, Blake.

49:33.104 --> 49:34.203
I had to.

49:34.205 --> 49:35.004
What'd she say?

49:42.547 --> 49:44.113
Blake.

49:44.115 --> 49:46.282
It's Eric.

49:46.284 --> 49:48.184
You're not going to like this.

49:48.186 --> 49:50.753
Your wife, based on the
voicemail you left her,

49:50.755 --> 49:52.054
is testifying against you.

50:08.373 --> 50:14.110
Just what we're need in
castle rock-- another atrocity.

50:14.112 --> 50:16.512
How many months pregnant, Jack?

50:16.514 --> 50:17.747
Three.

50:17.749 --> 50:21.484
And she had no idea
she was pregnant?

50:21.486 --> 50:24.186
There's more.

50:24.188 --> 50:28.524
Um, well, when i
confirmed her diagnosis,

50:28.526 --> 50:31.360
she became very disturbed.

50:31.362 --> 50:32.628
What do you mean?

50:32.630 --> 50:35.097
She said that the
father of the child

50:35.099 --> 50:37.733
was gonna kill her
when he found out.

50:48.513 --> 50:50.479
Anything?

50:50.481 --> 50:52.048
I'm afraid we're
gonna have to ask

50:52.050 --> 50:54.517
for a DNA test, Mr. blackman.

50:54.519 --> 50:56.118
There's enough
evidence to consider

50:56.120 --> 50:57.186
you a person of interest.

50:57.188 --> 50:57.820
Evidence?

50:57.822 --> 50:59.155
What evidence?

50:59.157 --> 51:01.424
We have a statement
from your wife

51:01.426 --> 51:05.461
that says the day
miss santoro vanished,

51:05.463 --> 51:07.229
you left her a
message confessing

51:07.231 --> 51:09.799
that you had done something
you felt terribly guilty about.

51:09.801 --> 51:11.667
Is she out of her mind?

51:11.669 --> 51:14.103
Yes, I left her a message
because I wanted to tell

51:14.105 --> 51:16.205
her the truth about the affair!

51:16.207 --> 51:20.176
Miss santoro was three
months pregnant, Mr. blackman.

51:28.419 --> 51:30.753
No.

51:30.755 --> 51:31.754
Wait.

51:31.756 --> 51:35.291
That's not possible.

51:35.293 --> 51:38.727
She called 911 about
the time she should

51:38.729 --> 51:42.598
have arrived back at the cabin.

51:42.600 --> 51:43.399
What?

51:46.337 --> 51:48.637
911?

51:51.576 --> 51:54.810
Mr. blackman,
you're under arrest.

51:54.812 --> 51:57.346
You have the right
to remain silent.

51:57.348 --> 51:59.715
Everything you say could be used
against you in a court of law.

51:59.717 --> 52:02.118
You have the right
to an attorney,

52:02.120 --> 52:04.787
have him present with you
while being questioned.

52:08.326 --> 52:11.393
As you wish.

53:16.794 --> 53:18.661
She's pregnant, Eric.

53:18.663 --> 53:19.695
The symptoms were there.

53:19.697 --> 53:21.630
It just never crossed my mind.

53:21.632 --> 53:23.832
So far it's a
circumstantial case.

53:23.834 --> 53:25.801
They have no
evidence against you.

53:25.803 --> 53:27.536
They're going to let
you go for a while,

53:27.538 --> 53:29.605
but this will give us time
to build the defense for you.

53:29.607 --> 53:32.808
Your wife's statement about
the phone call you made to her,

53:32.810 --> 53:33.976
it's not helping.

53:33.978 --> 53:36.445
I mean this is--
this is crazy, Eric.

53:36.447 --> 53:37.846
I called her to set
things straight,

53:37.848 --> 53:39.648
to tell her about everything.

53:39.650 --> 53:40.983
Well, you're going to have to
stay in this area for a while

53:40.985 --> 53:43.219
until we get this
straightened out.

53:43.221 --> 53:44.486
I know.

53:44.488 --> 53:45.788
Are you sure you
want to do this?

53:49.560 --> 53:51.827
It's not a good idea.

53:51.829 --> 53:54.830
As your attorney, I'm
advising you against it.

53:54.832 --> 53:56.265
This could all play against you.

54:21.959 --> 54:23.025
Hey, girl.

54:32.937 --> 54:34.937
Come on over here.

54:34.939 --> 54:38.907
That-a girl.

54:38.909 --> 54:40.009
I miss her too.

55:13.678 --> 55:16.545
--The flood
damaged crops will cost more,

55:16.547 --> 55:20.716
and that rain will delay harvest
in the Southern part of the us.

55:20.718 --> 55:21.884
How long have
you known sherman?

55:21.886 --> 55:23.986
Long enough to do him a favor.

55:23.988 --> 55:27.990
Yeah, well, he says
you're a stand up guy.

55:27.992 --> 55:29.491
He exaggerates.

55:29.493 --> 55:31.527
You used to work for
the police department?

55:31.529 --> 55:32.861
Years ago.

55:32.863 --> 55:34.730
And
now to our next story.

55:34.732 --> 55:37.833
A New York horror writer by
the name of Blake blackman

55:37.835 --> 55:40.536
is the official suspect
in the disappearance

55:40.538 --> 55:43.706
of his lover, Angelica
santoro, a book

55:43.708 --> 55:47.042
illustrator who went missing
days ago in Wyoming county,

55:47.044 --> 55:48.377
West Virginia.

55:48.379 --> 55:49.978
Sources report the
married suspect

55:49.980 --> 55:53.515
agreed to take a polygraph
test, which he failed.

55:53.517 --> 55:55.651
This is the fourth
missing persons

55:55.653 --> 55:58.053
case in the castle rock area.

55:58.055 --> 56:00.723
Lie detector test, huh?

56:00.725 --> 56:02.124
Not a smart move.

56:02.126 --> 56:03.726
You may write about
sinister things,

56:03.728 --> 56:05.828
but it don't mean
you are sinister.

56:05.830 --> 56:08.530
People tend to confuse
fiction with reality.

56:08.532 --> 56:10.532
And that's what
you're up against.

56:10.534 --> 56:12.134
Finding a missing persons
is one of the hardest

56:12.136 --> 56:16.405
things, especially after
the first 48 hours.

56:16.407 --> 56:18.974
It could take a day.

56:18.976 --> 56:19.942
It could take a lifetime.

56:31.956 --> 56:34.857
Yes, he should be
here at any moment.

56:34.859 --> 56:36.558
I understand that.

56:36.560 --> 56:39.061
But it took us five months
to get him to come up here.

56:39.063 --> 56:44.133
I think the board should
reconsider its decision, sir.

56:44.135 --> 56:45.834
I understand.

56:45.836 --> 56:47.469
Yes, Kaufman is here.

56:47.471 --> 56:50.005
We have the paperwork ready.

56:50.007 --> 56:51.106
Ok?

56:51.108 --> 56:52.074
I'll call you when we're done.

56:54.945 --> 56:56.111
They're going ahead with it.

56:56.113 --> 56:57.846
This isn't fair.

56:57.848 --> 57:00.582
They just want to get rid of
him because of the bad press.

57:00.584 --> 57:01.850
Well, you know the board.

57:01.852 --> 57:03.485
They're not gonna
take that risk.

57:03.487 --> 57:05.554
Screw the board, Eric.

57:05.556 --> 57:07.756
I know this guy for 10 years.

57:07.758 --> 57:09.491
He's my friend!

57:09.493 --> 57:10.492
What do you want me to do!

57:10.494 --> 57:12.694
I want you to let him go.

57:12.696 --> 57:17.032
No, it's not a fair decision,
but it's the correct one.

57:17.034 --> 57:21.203
And there's too much of
a risk for the company.

57:21.205 --> 57:22.538
You've got to let
him go, sherman.

57:41.192 --> 57:43.225
You don't have to do this.

57:43.227 --> 57:45.461
If you just finish writing
your last book then maybe--

57:45.463 --> 57:46.562
I'm done.

57:46.564 --> 57:47.996
Finished.

57:47.998 --> 57:50.666
I don't care, sherman.

57:50.668 --> 57:52.501
Don't you get it?

57:52.503 --> 57:53.802
I don't wanna write.

57:53.804 --> 57:55.804
I wanna go back and find her.

57:55.806 --> 57:58.707
Blake, it's been five months.

57:58.709 --> 58:00.042
You've got to let her go.

58:00.044 --> 58:02.611
Let the police and-- and
Melbourne do their job.

58:02.613 --> 58:03.579
He isn't doing shit.

58:03.581 --> 58:06.582
They still think I did it.

58:06.584 --> 58:09.585
The divorce left
me almost bankrupt,

58:09.587 --> 58:11.119
but I still got
enough to survive.

58:14.725 --> 58:17.159
I won't stop till i
find her, sherman.

58:17.161 --> 58:18.160
Come on.

58:18.162 --> 58:19.127
I can't.

59:04.875 --> 59:08.977
Listen, you've been
a really good friend.

59:08.979 --> 59:11.146
I'll always be
grateful for that.

59:11.148 --> 59:13.882
Stay in the cabin for
as long as you need.

59:13.884 --> 59:17.586
Melbourne's a good guy,
and you can trust him.

59:17.588 --> 59:18.220
Yeah.

59:29.934 --> 59:30.732
You can hand these out.

59:33.671 --> 59:34.303
You never know.

59:54.258 --> 59:56.825
Come on, girl.

01:00:59.056 --> 01:01:00.355
Melbourne, what's up?

01:01:00.357 --> 01:01:03.759
Listen, I need you
to go see someone.

01:01:30.254 --> 01:01:31.119
Hey, folks.

01:01:31.121 --> 01:01:32.254
How you doin'?

01:01:32.256 --> 01:01:33.355
Here's a picture
of my girlfriend.

01:01:33.357 --> 01:01:35.157
She's been missing for a while.

01:01:35.159 --> 01:01:37.292
I'd like you to keep a copy of
this, ask some of your friends.

01:01:51.909 --> 01:01:52.841
Mr. blackman?

01:01:52.843 --> 01:01:53.442
Yeah.

01:02:04.254 --> 01:02:05.053
May I?

01:02:21.305 --> 01:02:23.772
Straight down the hallway.

01:02:23.774 --> 01:02:24.506
He's waitin' on ya.

01:02:54.805 --> 01:02:56.004
It's ok, buddy.

01:03:00.511 --> 01:03:04.346
And now, do you know why
you're here, Mr. blackman?

01:03:08.252 --> 01:03:10.218
Melbourne told me
to come see you.

01:03:10.220 --> 01:03:12.053
He did, huh?

01:03:12.055 --> 01:03:13.855
What else did he say?

01:03:13.857 --> 01:03:16.458
That it was urgent.

01:03:16.460 --> 01:03:19.027
Urgent.

01:03:19.029 --> 01:03:20.996
Guns.

01:03:20.998 --> 01:03:26.334
How many innocent
people killed by 'em.

01:03:26.336 --> 01:03:29.471
What's happening
in this country?

01:03:29.473 --> 01:03:35.043
Children-- children are
killing other children.

01:03:35.045 --> 01:03:39.080
All these shootings
at schools, god.

01:03:39.082 --> 01:03:40.015
They're just babies.

01:03:42.352 --> 01:03:43.151
It's unbearable.

01:03:46.523 --> 01:03:51.426
And now there's people missing
in my town, Mr. blackman.

01:03:56.400 --> 01:03:57.465
I know who you are.

01:03:57.467 --> 01:03:59.167
Oh, yeah?

01:03:59.169 --> 01:04:00.068
Who?

01:04:00.070 --> 01:04:02.237
You're seagrass lambert.

01:04:02.239 --> 01:04:05.040
You own all the coal
mines in the area.

01:04:05.042 --> 01:04:10.111
First boy that went missing was
your grandson, James lambert

01:04:10.113 --> 01:04:14.082
vanished February 19th about
3:00 pm on his way home

01:04:14.084 --> 01:04:16.318
from school.

01:04:16.320 --> 01:04:18.320
Last person that saw him
was the school bus driver.

01:04:21.291 --> 01:04:22.090
It was a Friday.

01:04:26.396 --> 01:04:31.066
It was a Friday and i
promised him we'd go fishin'.

01:04:31.068 --> 01:04:34.469
My only grandson
has disappeared.

01:04:38.242 --> 01:04:40.542
Gone!

01:04:40.544 --> 01:04:45.480
Gone from the face of the
earth, leaving no trace.

01:04:49.052 --> 01:04:50.318
Why am I here?

01:04:50.320 --> 01:04:52.921
Because the whole
world thinks that you

01:04:52.923 --> 01:04:56.625
had something to do with your
girlfriend's disappearance.

01:04:56.627 --> 01:04:58.326
The police think you did it.

01:04:58.328 --> 01:05:02.597
The entire town thinks you
did it, except for Melbourne.

01:05:02.599 --> 01:05:09.237
And lucky for you-- damn lucky
for you, I like Melbourne.

01:05:10.440 --> 01:05:11.907
I trust him.

01:05:11.909 --> 01:05:15.043
You still haven't
answered my question.

01:05:15.045 --> 01:05:20.515
Melbourne says
that you need this.

01:05:22.252 --> 01:05:26.087
Maybe the cases are connected.

01:05:35.532 --> 01:05:38.233
Is that what this is about?

01:05:38.235 --> 01:05:39.701
Well, Melbourne's wrong.

01:05:39.703 --> 01:05:42.103
I'm not looking for a handout.

01:05:42.105 --> 01:05:44.105
I'll see myself out.

01:05:44.107 --> 01:05:45.540
Bullshit.

01:05:45.542 --> 01:05:48.243
We all know what
you did in New York.

01:05:48.245 --> 01:05:52.047
By the time this is all done,
you'll be so damn broke, you'll

01:05:52.049 --> 01:05:53.949
be begging for money.

01:05:53.951 --> 01:05:56.685
Don't be so proud.

01:05:56.687 --> 01:05:58.053
Take it.

01:05:58.055 --> 01:06:00.588
A gift.

01:06:00.590 --> 01:06:03.224
Police haven't
found anything yet.

01:06:03.226 --> 01:06:06.461
If you trace who did
it, there's a chance you

01:06:06.463 --> 01:06:08.163
might find out who took my boy.

01:06:10.701 --> 01:06:11.533
Hope.

01:06:15.505 --> 01:06:17.038
That's all I got.

01:06:20.177 --> 01:06:20.976
Hope.

01:06:23.680 --> 01:06:24.746
I don't mean to
be disrespectful.

01:06:31.355 --> 01:06:35.490
No photos of your boy?

01:06:35.492 --> 01:06:36.291
No.

01:06:39.029 --> 01:06:39.627
It's so painful.

01:06:43.200 --> 01:06:50.205
I appreciate the gesture,
but, uh, still I'm gonna pass.

01:06:50.207 --> 01:06:52.173
Melbourne was right about you.

01:06:52.175 --> 01:06:55.110
How's that?

01:06:55.112 --> 01:06:58.346
He's been.

01:06:58.348 --> 01:07:04.753
They had what you have--
the will to never give up.

01:07:04.755 --> 01:07:10.492
If you need anything,
people in this town owe me.

01:07:12.562 --> 01:07:13.361
Sir.

01:07:17.300 --> 01:07:20.268
One more thing.

01:07:20.270 --> 01:07:23.671
No one ever asked for ransom.

01:07:23.673 --> 01:07:26.808
They never asked for a dime.

01:07:26.810 --> 01:07:29.511
So the motive can't
be money, can it?

01:08:09.319 --> 01:08:13.688
I wore this when I was
pregnant with twins.

01:08:13.690 --> 01:08:16.624
Oh, there.

01:08:16.626 --> 01:08:18.792
That's better.

01:08:18.795 --> 01:08:22.764
Oh-- oh, I'm sure it's a boy.

01:08:22.765 --> 01:08:26.367
It's just gotta be a boy!

01:08:26.368 --> 01:08:29.571
You are huge!

01:08:29.573 --> 01:08:31.805
Angie.

01:08:31.808 --> 01:08:33.808
Angie.

01:08:33.810 --> 01:08:36.644
I'm not a monster.

01:08:36.645 --> 01:08:43.283
It's just that Leonard, he
don't like the boys running off.

01:08:43.819 --> 01:08:49.424
It's so-- it's so easy for
young boys to get hurt.

01:08:49.426 --> 01:08:52.660
And that's right.

01:08:52.662 --> 01:08:57.432
And we even got bear
traps out there.

01:08:57.434 --> 01:08:59.200
Bear traps?

01:08:59.202 --> 01:09:06.174
Huge bear traps out
there in the woods.

01:09:06.176 --> 01:09:11.145
You understand-- you
understand, Angie, don't you?

01:09:11.148 --> 01:09:12.881
Yeah.

01:09:12.883 --> 01:09:14.415
I understand, Margaret.

01:09:17.720 --> 01:09:18.685
Shh.

01:09:18.688 --> 01:09:19.520
Hush!

01:09:37.573 --> 01:09:39.573
What!

01:09:39.576 --> 01:09:41.576
Nothin'.

01:09:41.578 --> 01:09:43.711
My food ready yet?

01:09:43.712 --> 01:09:45.747
Yes, it is.

01:09:45.749 --> 01:09:48.383
It's on the table,
you blind fool!

01:09:59.296 --> 01:10:00.662
, here.

01:10:06.636 --> 01:10:07.602
Ah!

01:10:07.604 --> 01:10:08.469
Oh.

01:10:08.471 --> 01:10:09.604
A-- Angie?

01:10:09.606 --> 01:10:10.738
Are you ok?
-Yeah.

01:10:10.740 --> 01:10:11.639
Yeah.

01:10:11.641 --> 01:10:12.941
Don't worry about me.

01:10:12.943 --> 01:10:13.975
You guys eat.

01:10:13.977 --> 01:10:15.510
Quick, before she comes down.

01:10:22.886 --> 01:10:26.354
I'm sorry, Mr. blackman,
but we already told you.

01:10:26.356 --> 01:10:29.457
Dr. Morris cannot discuss
his patient's information

01:10:29.459 --> 01:10:30.792
with anyone.

01:10:30.794 --> 01:10:31.993
I understand that, but please--

01:10:31.995 --> 01:10:33.995
we've been through
this, remember?

01:10:33.997 --> 01:10:38.566
You must address your concerns
with the police, not us.

01:10:38.568 --> 01:10:40.835
This is my girlfriend
we're talkin' about.

01:10:40.837 --> 01:10:43.238
She was pregnant with my baby.

01:10:43.240 --> 01:10:44.839
Please, I'm begging you.

01:10:44.841 --> 01:10:46.507
It's been five months and the
police haven't found anything!

01:10:46.509 --> 01:10:50.979
Mr blackman, we can't help you!

01:10:50.981 --> 01:10:53.314
I'm afraid I'm going to
have to ask you to leave.

01:10:56.853 --> 01:10:57.652
Right.

01:11:07.530 --> 01:11:09.797
Yeah.

01:11:09.799 --> 01:11:10.598
I understand.

01:11:13.470 --> 01:11:14.335
Yes, sir.

01:11:14.337 --> 01:11:16.271
We'll do that.

01:11:16.273 --> 01:11:16.871
Bye.

01:11:19.776 --> 01:11:21.676
FBI?

01:11:21.678 --> 01:11:24.012
They're ready to step in.

01:11:24.014 --> 01:11:24.846
Anything?

01:11:24.848 --> 01:11:26.814
Afraid not, sir.

01:11:26.816 --> 01:11:29.751
It's been months and no leads.

01:11:29.753 --> 01:11:32.654
Those boys, Thompson,
what a nightmare.

01:11:32.656 --> 01:11:35.490
Blackman's case ain't
helping us either.

01:11:35.492 --> 01:11:37.058
He's a well-known writer.

01:11:37.060 --> 01:11:38.926
People are digging into it.

01:11:38.928 --> 01:11:41.062
Melbourne still helping him?

01:11:41.064 --> 01:11:43.665
As far as I know, yes.

01:11:43.667 --> 01:11:44.465
That old fox.

01:11:46.970 --> 01:11:48.536
Son of a bitch, he's good.

01:11:48.538 --> 01:11:50.672
You want me to talk to him?

01:11:50.674 --> 01:11:51.773
I can call him.

01:11:51.775 --> 01:11:53.441
Nah, never mind.

01:11:53.443 --> 01:11:58.946
Truth is we've got
nothin' on blackman.

01:11:58.948 --> 01:12:02.817
Phone records indicate that
the victim's 911 call was

01:12:02.819 --> 01:12:04.919
made nowhere near the cabin.

01:12:04.921 --> 01:12:09.023
What about that gas
station kid, Tommy?

01:12:09.025 --> 01:12:15.063
He remembers nothin.' Just
her SUV getting gas that day.

01:12:15.065 --> 01:12:17.365
These cases are gettin'
as cold as the weather.

01:12:38.855 --> 01:12:41.389
Stay here, girl.

01:12:41.391 --> 01:12:42.023
Stay.

01:12:57.440 --> 01:12:58.139
Do you know who I am?

01:12:58.141 --> 01:12:59.741
Listen, dude.

01:12:59.743 --> 01:13:02.143
I already told the police
everything that I know.

01:13:02.145 --> 01:13:03.845
Try harder.

01:13:03.847 --> 01:13:06.714
Are you 100% sure you didn't
see anybody else that day?

01:13:06.716 --> 01:13:07.849
Yeah.

01:13:07.851 --> 01:13:10.785
Nobody in here
inside the store?

01:13:10.787 --> 01:13:12.787
You guys have any
security cameras?

01:13:12.789 --> 01:13:15.490
Security cameras?

01:13:15.492 --> 01:13:16.424
Never mind.

01:13:16.426 --> 01:13:18.626
It's ok.

01:13:18.628 --> 01:13:19.427
Sorry.

01:13:24.067 --> 01:13:27.101
What pump did she use that day?

01:13:27.103 --> 01:13:29.170
Pump one, the same
one that you're at.

01:14:08.044 --> 01:14:09.076
Hey.

01:14:09.078 --> 01:14:11.612
What about the diesel pump area?

01:14:11.614 --> 01:14:12.747
No.

01:14:12.749 --> 01:14:15.116
Anybody fixing
any cars or tires?

01:14:15.118 --> 01:14:17.185
Not-- I don't know.

01:14:21.524 --> 01:14:22.156
Wait.

01:14:22.158 --> 01:14:23.925
Wait.

01:14:23.927 --> 01:14:26.527
I remember seeing a white Chevy.

01:14:26.529 --> 01:14:27.929
Wh-- what kind of Chevy?

01:14:27.931 --> 01:14:31.766
It was an old white impala
with a, um, flat tire.

01:14:31.768 --> 01:14:34.202
But it was way before
your girlfriend came in.

01:14:34.204 --> 01:14:36.737
Are you sure it was an impala?

01:14:36.739 --> 01:14:38.139
Yeah.

01:14:38.141 --> 01:14:40.775
It was old, like from the
'60s, and it was rusty.

01:14:40.777 --> 01:14:42.009
All right.

01:14:42.011 --> 01:14:43.845
Well, did you see
who was driving it?

01:14:43.847 --> 01:14:44.846
No.

01:14:44.848 --> 01:14:46.247
Sure?

01:14:46.249 --> 01:14:49.250
Yeah.

01:14:49.252 --> 01:14:52.053
Well, did you tell the police?

01:14:52.055 --> 01:14:53.654
No.

01:14:53.656 --> 01:14:56.791
So I'm the only one that knows.

01:14:56.793 --> 01:14:58.926
Yeah.

01:14:58.928 --> 01:14:59.727
Thanks.

01:15:32.862 --> 01:15:34.128
Oh!

01:15:34.130 --> 01:15:35.796
May I help you?

01:15:35.798 --> 01:15:40.001
I need to search for vehicles
registered in the '60s.

01:15:40.003 --> 01:15:40.935
Ma'am, please.

01:15:40.937 --> 01:15:42.203
I'm in a hurry.

01:15:42.205 --> 01:15:45.239
Aren't you that fella
that I have seen?

01:15:45.241 --> 01:15:47.208
Yes, I am.

01:15:47.210 --> 01:15:49.677
And who is that?

01:15:49.679 --> 01:15:51.245
That's Brandi.

01:15:51.247 --> 01:15:52.947
Oh.

01:15:52.949 --> 01:15:58.553
Well, you go to the room
at the end of the hallway.

01:15:58.555 --> 01:16:01.155
Now, we have a lot of
old cars in this town.

01:16:01.157 --> 01:16:02.189
Good luck.

01:16:02.191 --> 01:16:05.726
Uh-uh-uh, you leave her here.

01:16:05.728 --> 01:16:08.262
Brandi, stay.

01:16:08.264 --> 01:16:09.063
Good girl.

01:16:21.611 --> 01:16:22.944
I told ya.

01:16:22.946 --> 01:16:26.213
It's like lookin' for
a needle in a haystack.

01:16:26.215 --> 01:16:28.282
Yeah, exactly.

01:16:28.284 --> 01:16:30.618
What were you
lookin' for anyway?

01:16:30.620 --> 01:16:33.254
1960s white Chevy impala.

01:16:33.256 --> 01:16:34.889
I mean I don't even know
what I'm looking for.

01:16:34.891 --> 01:16:36.657
White impala.

01:16:36.659 --> 01:16:39.293
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

01:16:39.295 --> 01:16:42.897
I wish you had told me that
at the beginning, young man.

01:16:42.899 --> 01:16:44.966
You know, I am pretty
sure that Margaret

01:16:44.968 --> 01:16:47.635
and Leonard cunnings have one.

01:16:47.637 --> 01:16:51.639
It's from the '60s, and
it's a rusty white impala.

01:16:51.641 --> 01:16:52.273
Cunnings.

01:16:52.275 --> 01:16:54.075
Who are they?

01:16:54.077 --> 01:16:56.811
Well, they're folks that live
in an old farmhouse, you know,

01:16:56.813 --> 01:17:00.314
that was passed down
through the generations.

01:17:00.316 --> 01:17:04.685
And now, I haven't seen much
of them since the mudslide.

01:17:07.156 --> 01:17:09.724
Those poor little boys.

01:17:09.726 --> 01:17:12.059
What do you mean?

01:17:12.061 --> 01:17:14.962
It was awful.

01:17:14.964 --> 01:17:17.398
Probably nobody
thinks of it anymore.

01:17:17.400 --> 01:17:19.233
I mean it has been 30 years.

01:17:22.138 --> 01:17:25.640
But they had twin boys.

01:17:25.642 --> 01:17:28.075
They were really cute.

01:17:28.077 --> 01:17:31.345
1976.

01:17:31.347 --> 01:17:34.348
Yeah, that was the coldest
winter we have ever had.

01:17:34.350 --> 01:17:35.850
Yeah.

01:17:35.852 --> 01:17:39.687
They went out to the
lagoon behind the farm,

01:17:39.689 --> 01:17:45.059
they fell through the ice,
and they both drowned.

01:17:45.061 --> 01:17:47.261
Oh.

01:17:47.263 --> 01:17:51.799
They had to drag those
two little bodies

01:17:51.801 --> 01:17:53.134
through the water.

01:17:53.136 --> 01:17:54.168
It was terrible!

01:17:57.040 --> 01:17:58.406
Yeah.

01:17:58.408 --> 01:18:02.143
I guess-- I guess
that's why they never

01:18:02.145 --> 01:18:04.178
got rid of that old impala.

01:18:04.180 --> 01:18:09.750
Margaret used to drive those
boys to school in it every day.

01:18:09.752 --> 01:18:10.918
Where do they live?

01:18:10.920 --> 01:18:13.120
Folks say they
don't like visitors

01:18:13.122 --> 01:18:14.789
if you know what I mean.

01:18:14.791 --> 01:18:17.792
Ma'am, please, it's important.

01:18:17.794 --> 01:18:21.228
Well, off black fork road.

01:18:21.230 --> 01:18:27.334
After you cross over route
5 there's a big old gate.

01:18:27.336 --> 01:18:34.141
You know, once in a blue moon
i see Leonard driving by town.

01:18:34.143 --> 01:18:35.142
Oh well, forget it.

01:18:35.144 --> 01:18:36.277
Forget it.

01:18:36.279 --> 01:18:38.446
You better drive
up there tomorrow.

01:18:38.448 --> 01:18:41.282
I mean it is way in
the middle of nowhere.

01:18:47.890 --> 01:18:49.924
Thompson, I'm on my way
to the cunnings farm.

01:18:49.926 --> 01:18:51.225
You gotta follow this lead.

01:18:51.227 --> 01:18:52.727
Hey, don't go there, blackman.

01:18:52.729 --> 01:18:54.028
This is police business.

01:18:55.732 --> 01:18:58.065
Shit.

01:18:58.067 --> 01:18:58.966
Come on.

01:18:58.968 --> 01:18:59.767
Come on.

01:19:01.971 --> 01:19:02.770
Got it.

01:19:42.912 --> 01:19:44.512
Why are they barking like that?

01:19:48.151 --> 01:19:49.517
Somebody's outside.

01:20:14.410 --> 01:20:16.076
Can't you read?

01:20:16.078 --> 01:20:21.382
The sign says
"private property."

01:20:21.384 --> 01:20:22.183
Hush!

01:20:24.921 --> 01:20:27.321
Some beautiful
dogs you got there.

01:20:27.323 --> 01:20:30.057
I'm looking for Mrs.
cunnings, Margaret cunnings.

01:20:30.059 --> 01:20:31.058
What for?

01:20:31.060 --> 01:20:32.893
I'm a car collector.

01:20:32.895 --> 01:20:36.230
Someone in town told me about
your wife's Chevy impala.

01:20:36.232 --> 01:20:37.498
She must be a beauty.

01:20:37.500 --> 01:20:38.332
She is.

01:20:38.334 --> 01:20:39.200
She ain't for sale!

01:20:39.202 --> 01:20:40.267
I see.

01:20:40.269 --> 01:20:42.002
Who told you about it?

01:20:42.004 --> 01:20:44.505
Mrs. cornerstone
from the courthouse.

01:20:44.507 --> 01:20:46.607
Do I know you?

01:20:46.609 --> 01:20:48.442
I don't think so.

01:20:48.444 --> 01:20:51.045
I'm just passing by, you know,
driving through the coal mine

01:20:51.047 --> 01:20:54.215
areas lookin' for good
deals on antique cars

01:20:54.217 --> 01:20:55.049
that I can restore.

01:21:00.156 --> 01:21:02.356
Brandi?

01:21:02.358 --> 01:21:03.524
That's my dog!

01:21:03.526 --> 01:21:06.227
Brandi?

01:21:06.229 --> 01:21:07.261
Oh my god.

01:21:07.263 --> 01:21:08.362
Help!

01:21:08.364 --> 01:21:09.196
Help!

01:21:09.198 --> 01:21:10.164
We're here!

01:21:10.166 --> 01:21:11.498
Oh my god.

01:21:11.500 --> 01:21:12.433
Brandi?

01:21:12.435 --> 01:21:13.334
Brandi girl!

01:21:13.336 --> 01:21:15.302
Help!

01:21:15.304 --> 01:21:19.206
Anyway, we better be goin'.

01:21:19.208 --> 01:21:21.141
Too bad she's not for sale.

01:21:25.481 --> 01:21:26.480
Brandi!

01:21:26.482 --> 01:21:28.048
Help!

01:21:30.019 --> 01:21:31.385
Help!

01:21:31.387 --> 01:21:32.953
Brandi!

01:21:32.955 --> 01:21:33.954
Help!

01:21:33.956 --> 01:21:34.922
Help!

01:21:34.924 --> 01:21:35.923
We're here!

01:21:35.925 --> 01:21:36.590
Help!

01:21:36.592 --> 01:21:37.391
Please!

01:21:40.596 --> 01:21:43.097
You little whore!

01:21:43.099 --> 01:21:46.433
Do you want something bad
to happen to our baby?

01:22:08.391 --> 01:22:09.990
Who's that Jasper?

01:22:09.992 --> 01:22:13.060
Don't rightly know.

01:22:13.062 --> 01:22:17.097
There's something not
right about that boy.

01:22:17.099 --> 01:22:18.599
I don't like it.

01:22:33.015 --> 01:22:34.949
Thompson, this time
you gotta hear me out.

01:22:34.951 --> 01:22:36.283
Mr. blackman,
we'll look into it.

01:22:36.285 --> 01:22:37.551
But you don't
understand, I went there.

01:22:37.553 --> 01:22:39.453
These people are
hiding something.

01:22:39.455 --> 01:22:41.121
You went all the way
to the cunnings farm?

01:22:41.123 --> 01:22:42.389
Yes.

01:22:42.391 --> 01:22:43.390
I went to the property
and cunnings held

01:22:43.392 --> 01:22:44.425
a gun on me the whole time.

01:22:44.427 --> 01:22:45.626
I mean come on, who does that?

01:22:45.628 --> 01:22:47.594
Mr. blackman, this
is West Virginia,

01:22:47.596 --> 01:22:50.464
and you trespassed
private property.

01:22:50.466 --> 01:22:53.400
Now, I thought we were
clear that we check into it.

01:22:53.402 --> 01:22:55.469
Now I'm concerned that you
drove all the way up there

01:22:55.471 --> 01:22:59.106
and harass these people just
because they own a old Chevy.

01:22:59.108 --> 01:23:01.542
You're not gonna do anything
about it, huh, Thompson?

01:23:01.544 --> 01:23:02.643
It's-- it's unbelievable!

01:23:05.982 --> 01:23:08.749
Travis, I'd like to speak
with sheriff McFadden.

01:23:08.751 --> 01:23:10.718
You want me to get the sheriff?

01:23:10.720 --> 01:23:11.552
That won't be necessary.

01:23:33.409 --> 01:23:35.409
What if he's right?

01:23:35.411 --> 01:23:37.311
What are you sayin'?

01:23:37.313 --> 01:23:39.179
I don't know.

01:23:39.181 --> 01:23:42.049
All I'm sayin' is
maybe we should pay

01:23:42.051 --> 01:23:43.250
a visit to their old farmhouse.

01:24:23.492 --> 01:24:27.327
Black
fork, castle rock.

01:25:10.639 --> 01:25:11.438
Hey, Steve.

01:25:20.216 --> 01:25:21.782
I am so sorry.

01:25:21.784 --> 01:25:23.750
I didn't realize you
officers were out here.

01:25:23.752 --> 01:25:24.718
Ma'am--

01:25:24.720 --> 01:25:25.652
let me put away the dogs.

01:25:36.899 --> 01:25:38.765
Gosh, I hope
everything's all right.

01:25:38.767 --> 01:25:39.600
Yes.

01:25:39.602 --> 01:25:40.601
No worries.

01:25:40.603 --> 01:25:42.436
Mrs. cunnings, right?

01:25:42.438 --> 01:25:44.671
Please, call me Margaret.

01:25:44.673 --> 01:25:45.606
I'm officer Thompson.

01:25:45.608 --> 01:25:47.774
This is officer Travis.

01:25:47.776 --> 01:25:51.912
Mind if we take a look
around a sec, ma'am.

01:25:51.914 --> 01:25:54.314
Yes, sure.

01:25:54.316 --> 01:25:54.915
Please.

01:26:05.327 --> 01:26:08.929
You probably heard the
missing persons reports.

01:26:08.931 --> 01:26:09.763
Just checking the area.

01:26:14.670 --> 01:26:15.936
Routine call.

01:26:15.938 --> 01:26:17.905
Yes, of course.

01:26:17.907 --> 01:26:20.774
You folks own that car outside?

01:26:20.776 --> 01:26:22.743
Yes, sir, it's ours.

01:26:22.745 --> 01:26:26.547
Is there anybody else in the
house with you, Mrs. cunnings.

01:26:26.549 --> 01:26:29.316
Well, my husband, Leonard.

01:26:29.318 --> 01:26:30.484
But he ain't here right now.

01:26:30.486 --> 01:26:33.253
He's done gone to town.

01:26:33.255 --> 01:26:35.956
You mind if we take a
look around Mrs. cunnings?

01:26:35.958 --> 01:26:37.324
Not at all.

01:26:37.326 --> 01:26:39.927
I'm just making
some BlackBerry jam.

01:26:39.929 --> 01:26:41.395
That's my favorite.

01:27:23.505 --> 01:27:24.471
It's all clear.

01:27:27.543 --> 01:27:29.476
What's this?

01:27:29.478 --> 01:27:30.744
It's an old attic.

01:27:30.746 --> 01:27:32.613
We ain't been up there
in years, and I'm

01:27:32.615 --> 01:27:34.514
sure there isn't
anything up there

01:27:34.516 --> 01:27:35.849
you all would be interested in.

01:27:35.851 --> 01:27:37.451
I'm afraid we're going
to have to take a look,

01:27:37.453 --> 01:27:40.254
if that's ok with you, ma'am.

01:27:40.256 --> 01:27:42.389
Suit yourself.

01:27:42.391 --> 01:27:42.990
May I?

01:28:20.496 --> 01:28:22.596
Hey, Steve?

01:28:22.598 --> 01:28:24.965
I think you should
take a look at this.

01:28:48.457 --> 01:28:50.857
I think we're done here.

01:29:13.882 --> 01:29:15.582
Ok.

01:29:15.584 --> 01:29:20.721
That was, uh-- did
you see that attic?

01:29:20.723 --> 01:29:23.557
Gave me the creeps, man.

01:29:23.559 --> 01:29:25.859
Ah, well, i-- i
guess I was wrong.

01:29:30.532 --> 01:29:32.532
What?

01:29:32.534 --> 01:29:33.600
Somethin' doesn't feel right.

01:30:11.807 --> 01:30:12.672
Shh.

01:30:12.674 --> 01:30:13.473
You be quiet.

01:30:17.179 --> 01:30:18.111
Just hush!

01:30:22.985 --> 01:30:25.886
They're gone!

01:30:25.888 --> 01:30:28.488
Oh, what's wrong with her?

01:30:28.490 --> 01:30:29.656
What's wrong with her?

01:30:29.658 --> 01:30:31.625
I'll tell you what's
wrong with her!

01:30:31.627 --> 01:30:35.095
You did this to her and now
she's having a damn baby!

01:30:35.097 --> 01:30:38.498
Wha-- oh, shoot!

01:30:38.500 --> 01:30:39.199
Now what are we gonna do?

01:30:39.201 --> 01:30:41.101
Damn you, Margaret!

01:30:41.103 --> 01:30:42.602
You deal with this!

01:30:42.604 --> 01:30:44.571
I told you to get rid
of her a long time ago!

01:30:44.573 --> 01:30:46.907
And I asked you to
go get me supplies!

01:30:46.909 --> 01:30:49.476
What a damn loser,!

01:30:49.478 --> 01:30:50.210
I got nobody!

01:31:01.990 --> 01:31:03.790
Melbourne, please tell
me you got something.

01:31:03.792 --> 01:31:05.125
There's nothing weird
about these people.

01:31:05.127 --> 01:31:06.927
The background
check come up clean.

01:31:06.929 --> 01:31:09.229
Anything about an accident?

01:31:09.231 --> 01:31:10.697
What are you talking about?

01:31:10.699 --> 01:31:12.466
Ah, it's just the
lady at the courthouse

01:31:12.468 --> 01:31:15.535
said they-- they lost their
twin boys about 30 years ago.

01:31:15.537 --> 01:31:17.471
They fell through
the ice and drown.

01:31:17.473 --> 01:31:18.104
Drown?

01:31:18.106 --> 01:31:19.573
Yeah.

01:31:19.575 --> 01:31:21.208
In a lagoon on their property.

01:31:21.210 --> 01:31:22.976
I went there.

01:31:22.978 --> 01:31:24.511
These people are not friendly.

01:31:24.513 --> 01:31:26.146
Is that lagoon on the
back of the property?

01:31:26.148 --> 01:31:27.481
Ah, southeast end.

01:31:29.952 --> 01:31:31.852
They even have a
graveyard there.

01:31:31.854 --> 01:31:33.920
You know what's weird?

01:31:33.922 --> 01:31:36.790
Brandi, Angie's dog
found a baseball

01:31:36.792 --> 01:31:38.959
the day before she disappeared.

01:31:38.961 --> 01:31:40.060
Where?

01:31:40.062 --> 01:31:40.861
In the woods.

01:31:43.832 --> 01:31:45.866
And Angie swore there
was somebody out there.

01:31:45.868 --> 01:31:47.567
I remember you mentioned
something about that

01:31:47.569 --> 01:31:48.935
in your police report.

01:31:48.937 --> 01:31:51.104
What's really weird,
the ball just came

01:31:51.106 --> 01:31:54.274
down the stairs out of nowhere.

01:31:54.276 --> 01:31:56.943
Has the initials
tb written on it.

01:31:56.945 --> 01:31:57.944
Does that sound familiar at all?

01:32:00.883 --> 01:32:01.781
Tb.

01:32:01.783 --> 01:32:04.551
No.

01:32:04.553 --> 01:32:05.285
Must be losing it.

01:32:09.691 --> 01:32:13.560
Melbourne, listen, I gotta go.

01:32:13.562 --> 01:32:17.764
Do me a favor, meet me
in an hour at the cabin.

01:32:17.766 --> 01:32:19.566
Blake, don't do
anything stupid.

01:32:19.568 --> 01:32:20.567
Let's go to McFadden first.

01:32:24.940 --> 01:32:27.908
Great.

01:32:27.910 --> 01:32:29.042
Oh my god.

01:32:29.044 --> 01:32:30.277
Come on, Angie.
You can do this.

01:32:30.279 --> 01:32:31.545
You can do this.

01:32:31.547 --> 01:32:32.579
You can do this.
You can do this.

01:32:32.581 --> 01:32:33.213
You can do this.

01:32:33.215 --> 01:32:34.247
You can do this.

01:32:34.249 --> 01:32:37.817
Boys, quick!

01:32:37.819 --> 01:32:38.785
Ok.

01:32:38.787 --> 01:32:41.054
Ok.

01:32:41.056 --> 01:32:42.689
Stay down.

01:32:42.691 --> 01:32:43.323
Shh.

01:32:43.325 --> 01:32:44.224
She's coming!

01:32:44.226 --> 01:32:45.759
Quick!
Don't move!

01:32:45.761 --> 01:32:46.593
Don't move!

01:32:46.595 --> 01:32:48.795
Don't-- shit.

01:32:48.797 --> 01:32:50.897
Ah!

01:32:50.899 --> 01:32:51.731
Shh.

01:32:56.104 --> 01:32:57.103
Ah.

01:32:57.105 --> 01:32:57.904
Oh.

01:33:12.955 --> 01:33:16.156
Don't you go having
my baby boy now!

01:33:19.027 --> 01:33:20.360
You just stay right here!

01:33:20.362 --> 01:33:22.662
I gotta go get some things.

01:33:22.664 --> 01:33:23.797
And don't move!

01:33:39.081 --> 01:33:41.047
Quick!

01:33:41.049 --> 01:33:42.048
Are you ok?

01:33:42.050 --> 01:33:43.049
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

01:33:43.051 --> 01:33:45.652
Sweetie,.

01:33:45.654 --> 01:33:46.286
Come here.

01:33:46.288 --> 01:33:47.954
Listen up.

01:33:47.956 --> 01:33:50.357
Jimmy, you see that window?

01:33:50.359 --> 01:33:52.292
Ok, I want you to
do something for me.

01:34:14.149 --> 01:34:15.749
Tobias barrette.

01:34:15.751 --> 01:34:16.716
Holy shit!

01:34:35.937 --> 01:34:36.836
Come on, sherman.

01:34:36.838 --> 01:34:38.338
You said it was here.

01:34:38.340 --> 01:34:39.139
Bingo.

01:35:11.306 --> 01:35:14.240
Listen, this is very important.

01:35:14.242 --> 01:35:16.409
You understand?

01:35:16.411 --> 01:35:20.246
We need to know that you
are 100% certain that you

01:35:20.248 --> 01:35:21.848
saw that Chevy that day.

01:35:24.720 --> 01:35:26.853
I-- I'm sure.

01:35:26.855 --> 01:35:29.456
I remember now.

01:35:29.458 --> 01:35:32.158
They come in to fix a
flat tire in the rain.

01:35:35.330 --> 01:35:37.997
Did you see the driver?

01:35:37.999 --> 01:35:39.766
No, sir.

01:35:39.768 --> 01:35:43.303
The windows were all fogged up.

01:35:43.305 --> 01:35:44.170
Ok.

01:35:44.172 --> 01:35:45.004
Thanks, tom.

01:35:45.006 --> 01:35:46.306
You can go now.

01:35:46.308 --> 01:35:47.807
Tell your father I said hi.

01:35:50.479 --> 01:35:55.281
Travis, make sure none of
this leaks to the press.

01:35:55.283 --> 01:35:56.082
Yes, sir.

01:35:58.987 --> 01:36:01.755
How'd we miss this?

01:36:01.757 --> 01:36:04.124
I'll revise his
original statement.

01:36:04.126 --> 01:36:07.193
I guess he just
forgot to mention it.

01:36:07.195 --> 01:36:09.429
This ain't good.

01:36:09.431 --> 01:36:10.263
I'll say this.

01:36:13.135 --> 01:36:16.002
We've kept a close
eye on blackman.

01:36:16.004 --> 01:36:18.438
It's been five
months and the man is

01:36:18.440 --> 01:36:21.541
still here searching for her.

01:36:21.543 --> 01:36:24.444
Sir, the man still has her dog.

01:36:24.446 --> 01:36:27.213
What kind of suspect does that?

01:36:27.215 --> 01:36:32.285
Leonard and Margaret cunnings.

01:36:32.287 --> 01:36:33.386
Get me a map of their property.

01:36:36.458 --> 01:36:37.257
Done.

01:36:41.096 --> 01:36:42.028
Gotta be a link somewhere.

01:36:45.467 --> 01:36:47.967
Call the board.

01:36:47.969 --> 01:36:50.403
You are not going
to believe this.

01:36:50.405 --> 01:36:54.941
The sales for blackman's
books are through the roof.

01:36:54.943 --> 01:36:58.077
This whole thing about
him being a prime suspect

01:36:58.079 --> 01:37:01.214
has caused the morbid
readers to buy like crazy.

01:37:01.216 --> 01:37:02.015
You serious?

01:37:21.102 --> 01:37:21.901
Nasty.

01:37:34.316 --> 01:37:36.316
What the--

01:37:51.600 --> 01:37:53.366
Tobias barrette.

01:38:12.954 --> 01:38:14.954
Sherman, it's Melbourne.

01:38:14.956 --> 01:38:16.322
Buddy, listen up.

01:38:16.324 --> 01:38:18.658
Did you tell blackman
where that old rifle is?

01:38:18.660 --> 01:38:21.160
Well, yeah.

01:38:21.162 --> 01:38:24.931
I think I mentioned in
the upstairs closet.

01:38:24.933 --> 01:38:25.531
Why?

01:38:54.029 --> 01:38:54.994
This is it.

01:39:00.001 --> 01:39:01.601
They own 100 acres of farmland.

01:39:01.603 --> 01:39:03.236
There's a lagoon in there.

01:39:03.238 --> 01:39:05.605
Didn't their boys die 30
years ago in that accident?

01:39:05.607 --> 01:39:06.706
The beds in the attic.

01:39:06.708 --> 01:39:09.042
They fell through the ice.

01:39:09.044 --> 01:39:10.543
The lagoon was frozen.

01:39:10.545 --> 01:39:11.411
Perfect place.

01:39:11.413 --> 01:39:13.112
To drown evidence.

01:39:13.114 --> 01:39:13.947
I'm sorry.

01:39:13.949 --> 01:39:15.315
The sheriff is busy.

01:39:15.317 --> 01:39:18.017
Mr. Melbourne, you
can't go in there!

01:39:18.019 --> 01:39:18.718
I'm sorry, sheriff.

01:39:18.720 --> 01:39:20.219
It's ok, Nancy.

01:39:20.221 --> 01:39:21.321
You want to get in more
trouble, Melbourne?

01:39:21.323 --> 01:39:22.355
Stay out of this.

01:39:22.357 --> 01:39:23.957
I need to show you something.

01:39:23.959 --> 01:39:25.291
Just because his publisher
hired you doesn't mean

01:39:25.293 --> 01:39:27.226
you can interfere with
a police investigation.

01:39:27.228 --> 01:39:28.428
Russ, we need to talk.

01:39:28.430 --> 01:39:29.629
About blackman?

01:39:29.631 --> 01:39:30.663
No.

01:39:30.665 --> 01:39:31.497
Toby barrette.

01:39:35.270 --> 01:39:36.502
Where'd you get this?

01:39:36.504 --> 01:39:37.503
I'll tell you all
about it in the car,

01:39:37.505 --> 01:39:39.138
but we don't have much time.

01:39:39.140 --> 01:39:40.740
Blackman's on his way to
cunnings and he's got a gun.

01:39:40.742 --> 01:39:43.509
Sheriff, the FBI.

01:39:43.511 --> 01:39:44.711
Shit.

01:39:44.713 --> 01:39:45.545
Put them through.

01:39:45.547 --> 01:39:46.980
No, sir.

01:39:46.982 --> 01:39:49.015
They're here-- two
officers downstairs,

01:39:49.017 --> 01:39:52.051
and they want to speak to you.

01:39:52.053 --> 01:39:52.752
Go ahead.

01:39:52.754 --> 01:39:54.587
I'll take care of this.

01:39:54.589 --> 01:39:56.422
Take all units with you.

01:39:56.424 --> 01:39:58.191
Go!

01:39:58.193 --> 01:39:58.992
And Melbourne.

01:40:07.635 --> 01:40:08.634
Put this on.

01:40:08.636 --> 01:40:10.103
Come here.

01:40:10.105 --> 01:40:11.137
Quick, quick, quick,
before they come in.

01:40:15.510 --> 01:40:16.476
You ok?

01:40:16.478 --> 01:40:17.477
Ok.

01:40:17.479 --> 01:40:18.277
Go!

01:40:21.750 --> 01:40:23.683
Jimmy, I don't wanna do this.

01:40:23.685 --> 01:40:25.585
Listen, you have to
do this, you hear me?

01:40:25.587 --> 01:40:27.220
This is the only
chance we may have.

01:40:27.222 --> 01:40:28.621
Come on, Jimmy's
going to help you.

01:40:28.623 --> 01:40:29.455
Come on, Emmett.

01:40:29.457 --> 01:40:30.323
She's right.

01:40:30.325 --> 01:40:31.524
You can do this.

01:40:35.363 --> 01:40:36.629
A-- Angie, what about you?

01:40:36.631 --> 01:40:38.631
don-- don't worry about me.

01:40:38.633 --> 01:40:39.665
I can't.

01:40:39.667 --> 01:40:41.234
If they find out they'll hit us!

01:40:41.236 --> 01:40:42.402
They-- they won't find out.

01:40:42.404 --> 01:40:43.636
If you hurry up,
they won't find out.

01:40:43.638 --> 01:40:44.637
Go!

01:40:44.639 --> 01:40:46.205
Go!

01:40:46.207 --> 01:40:47.206

01:40:47.208 --> 01:40:48.674
Run.

01:40:48.676 --> 01:40:50.143
Don't stop until you reach
the highway, you hear me?

01:40:53.515 --> 01:40:54.514
They're coming down!

01:40:54.516 --> 01:40:55.415
Go!

01:40:55.417 --> 01:40:56.249
Go!

01:40:56.251 --> 01:40:57.283
Run!

01:40:57.285 --> 01:40:58.084

01:41:04.793 --> 01:41:06.359
Shit!

01:41:06.361 --> 01:41:07.226
Leonard!

01:41:07.228 --> 01:41:08.561
She's let them out!

01:41:08.563 --> 01:41:09.562
Quick!

01:41:09.564 --> 01:41:11.330
Put out the dogs!

01:41:15.103 --> 01:41:18.071
I knew you had to die.

01:41:18.073 --> 01:41:22.208
Now, I'm gonna make sure
you have a stillborn son!

01:41:22.210 --> 01:41:22.842
No!

01:41:22.844 --> 01:41:23.843
You bitch!

01:41:57.178 --> 01:41:58.177
You boys all right?

01:41:58.179 --> 01:41:58.811
Where'd you come from?

01:41:58.813 --> 01:42:00.713
The basement window.

01:42:00.715 --> 01:42:01.647
The lady let us out?

01:42:01.649 --> 01:42:02.482
What lady?

01:42:02.484 --> 01:42:04.784
The pregnant lady!

01:42:04.786 --> 01:42:05.718
Where?

01:42:05.720 --> 01:42:06.719
Tell me where she is!

01:42:06.721 --> 01:42:09.388
In the basement on the farm!

01:42:09.390 --> 01:42:11.190
Boys, listen to me.

01:42:11.192 --> 01:42:12.792
I want you to run as fast as you
can till you reach the highway,

01:42:12.794 --> 01:42:13.826
do you hear me?

01:42:13.828 --> 01:42:14.794
Don't look back.

01:42:14.796 --> 01:42:15.761
Just go and find help.

01:42:15.763 --> 01:42:16.596
Run!

01:42:19.634 --> 01:42:20.433
Drop it!

01:42:25.306 --> 01:42:30.443
You got my boys,
and I want my boys.

01:42:30.445 --> 01:42:32.545
They never were your boys!

01:42:32.547 --> 01:42:39.352
Oh, my leg!

01:42:39.354 --> 01:42:41.687
--All

01:42:41.689 --> 01:42:42.655
Leave me alone!

01:42:42.657 --> 01:42:43.523
Leave me alone!

01:42:43.525 --> 01:42:44.590
I hope so!

01:42:44.592 --> 01:42:46.592
I'm gonna tell you why.

01:42:46.594 --> 01:42:47.426
No!

01:42:47.428 --> 01:42:48.728
Help!

01:42:48.730 --> 01:42:52.265
You and that bastard

01:42:56.704 --> 01:42:58.237
No!

01:42:58.239 --> 01:43:01.407
Because I'm gonna give
you a real c-section!

01:43:01.409 --> 01:43:02.208
Ah!

01:43:09.417 --> 01:43:10.216

Good to have you back.

01:44:35.370 --> 01:44:36.002
Just like old times.

01:45:02.030 --> 01:45:04.530
Everything ok?

01:45:04.532 --> 01:45:05.698
We need to find blackman!

01:45:33.094 --> 01:45:35.428
They found the boys!

01:45:35.430 --> 01:45:37.563
Two of them are alive.

01:45:37.565 --> 01:45:40.633
Sir, one is your grandson.

01:45:40.635 --> 01:45:41.434

01:47:12.126 --> 01:47:12.992
It's me.

01:47:12.994 --> 01:47:14.126
I'm here.

It's all right, baby.

01:47:15.463 --> 01:47:16.061
I'm here.

Havin' the baby..

It'll be ok now.

01:48:14.155 --> 01:48:15.921

01:48:26.868 --> 01:48:28.801
He's one of my
boys all growed up.

Just try to stay calm, ok?

01:48:54.862 --> 01:48:55.694
All right?

01:48:55.696 --> 01:48:56.996
Now listen to me.

01:48:56.998 --> 01:48:58.764
I need you to push as
hard as you can, ok?
