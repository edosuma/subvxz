00:25.410 --> 00:26.910
We've got a MiG on our tail.

00:28.250 --> 00:29.350
(Hawke) Engage both engines.

00:29.410 --> 00:30.390
Both at once?

00:30.450 --> 00:31.480
Now!

00:35.990 --> 00:37.660
You know where Airwolf is.

00:38.160 --> 00:39.460
You've got to tell me.

00:39.530 --> 00:41.630
(Archangel) We're talking about Hawke's life.

00:47.300 --> 00:48.900
It's an artery. It won't stop.

00:48.970 --> 00:50.170
He's fibrillating!

01:55.270 --> 01:56.270
[beeping]

01:56.370 --> 01:58.510
File A56-7W.

01:58.570 --> 02:00.280
(narrator) Subject: Airwolf. Top secret.

02:00.340 --> 02:01.910
A Mach 1-plus attack helicopter

02:01.970 --> 02:04.250
with the most advanced
weapons arsenal in the air.

02:04.310 --> 02:06.150
Sought by governments friendly and foreign,

02:06.210 --> 02:08.280
Airwolf is hidden somewhere
in the western wilderness

02:08.350 --> 02:09.949
by its test pilot, Stringfellow Hawke

02:10.020 --> 02:11.650
to be returned to the US government

02:11.720 --> 02:13.200
only if his brother, Sin Jin,

02:13.250 --> 02:14.630
an MIA in Vietnam, can be found.

02:14.690 --> 02:16.760
The deputy director of the intelligence agency

02:16.820 --> 02:18.130
that developed Airwolf

02:18.190 --> 02:19.900
is Michael Goldsmith-Briggs III,

02:19.960 --> 02:21.200
code name Archangel.

02:21.260 --> 02:23.710
Believed to covertly provide
classified information

02:23.760 --> 02:25.870
and support to Hawke in
exchange for flying the chopper

02:25.930 --> 02:27.600
on missions of national interest.

02:27.670 --> 02:29.340
Stringfellow Hawke is 34,

02:29.400 --> 02:30.810
reclusive, sensitive, and a loner.

02:30.870 --> 02:32.040
Known to associate with

02:32.100 --> 02:34.020
his only friend and mentor, Dominic Santini.

02:34.070 --> 02:36.480
Together, Santini and Hawke fly Airwolf.

02:36.540 --> 02:38.820
Capable of speeds rivaling the fastest jets

02:38.880 --> 02:40.450
and backed by unmatched firepower,

02:40.510 --> 02:42.080
Airwolf is a weapon too dangerous

02:42.150 --> 02:43.680
to be left in unenlightened hands.

02:43.750 --> 02:45.730
Finding Airwolf is your 1st priority.

02:45.780 --> 02:47.060
End of file.

04:21.649 --> 04:24.020
(Moore) What's here is a
gift. Talk costs money.

04:24.080 --> 04:26.590
I'll be at the closed-down airstrip
over in Crofton in an hour.

04:26.650 --> 04:28.190
Come if you're interested.

04:33.730 --> 04:34.900
(Hawke) Sin Jin.

05:24.310 --> 05:26.550
Hello, old stick. Remember me?

05:28.810 --> 05:30.620
Peter MacGregor Moore.

05:31.120 --> 05:32.720
How could I ever forget?

05:32.780 --> 05:34.760
Short notice, but I thought you'd make it.

05:35.490 --> 05:36.900
Is my brother alive?

05:36.960 --> 05:39.600
I said that talk costs money.

05:40.490 --> 05:42.370
How much money?

05:43.600 --> 05:46.300
I'd take a trade. Say,
that chopper over there.

05:46.360 --> 05:48.070
It's not mine.

05:48.130 --> 05:50.370
Too bad. What about your cabin?

05:50.800 --> 05:52.750
Or maybe this wonderful art collection

05:52.800 --> 05:54.340
I've heard so much about.

05:56.980 --> 05:59.050
The years haven't improved
your sense of humor,

05:59.110 --> 06:00.180
have they?

06:00.250 --> 06:01.720
Don't you play with me, Moore.

06:02.210 --> 06:03.750
Not about this.

06:04.380 --> 06:07.590
I'll take $1,000 to cover my expenses.

06:08.220 --> 06:09.430
Agreed.

06:12.460 --> 06:14.630
Your brother's being held in this compound.

06:15.790 --> 06:17.070
Weighs about 100 pounds,

06:17.130 --> 06:18.800
but he's basically healthy.

06:18.930 --> 06:20.640
His mind is still in good nick.

06:21.170 --> 06:22.170
Where?

06:22.400 --> 06:24.640
Quon Ling province, North Vietnam.

06:24.900 --> 06:26.750
Off-course weather satellite picked him up

06:26.810 --> 06:28.050
purely by chance.

06:28.470 --> 06:30.950
Sin Jin is being held with 11 other Caucasians

06:31.010 --> 06:34.350
by an ex-NVA Colonel named Nuyen Min Giap.

06:35.050 --> 06:37.190
Apparently, a man who holds a grudge.

06:37.250 --> 06:39.630
2 of his prisoners are ex-Frog Legionnaires

06:39.750 --> 06:43.200
dating all the way back
to Dien Bien Phu in '54.

06:43.460 --> 06:45.160
Poor sods are in their 60s.

06:45.290 --> 06:47.030
How'd you find out about this?

06:47.130 --> 06:48.370
Another mercenary.

06:48.430 --> 06:50.570
He occasionally freelances for the Firm.

06:51.160 --> 06:52.440
After we picked up the shot,

06:52.500 --> 06:54.500
we sent him in to take a closer look.

06:54.570 --> 06:56.410
So, the Firm knows all about this?

06:57.370 --> 06:59.350
Wondering why your friend Archangel

06:59.400 --> 07:00.610
didn't tell you?

07:03.280 --> 07:05.080
Don't be too hard on old Michael.

07:05.740 --> 07:07.450
He's got a task force together,

07:07.510 --> 07:08.680
ready for a rescue mission.

07:08.750 --> 07:10.350
Trained them personally at Langley

07:10.420 --> 07:12.830
so they wouldn't screw up,
like they did in Iran.

07:12.880 --> 07:14.760
At the last minute, the State Department

07:14.820 --> 07:16.260
pulled the rug from under him.

07:16.320 --> 07:17.600
Last I heard,

07:17.660 --> 07:19.500
they were negotiating for a release.

07:20.690 --> 07:22.430
Now you know as much as I know.

07:22.490 --> 07:23.910
I suggest you don't tip your hand

07:23.960 --> 07:25.200
to dear Michael.

07:27.530 --> 07:28.940
Don't you want your money?

07:30.240 --> 07:32.040
I had a brother once.

07:32.100 --> 07:34.280
I lost him in Rhodesia a couple of years ago.

07:34.540 --> 07:35.880
It's on the house.

07:35.940 --> 07:39.010
Even an old whore like me
has a heart buried somewhere.

09:33.930 --> 09:35.560
[people chattering]

09:40.330 --> 09:41.830
Over here, come on.

09:42.830 --> 09:44.250
[fire crackling]

10:01.790 --> 10:02.790
[siren wailing]

10:03.860 --> 10:05.860
It's an artery. It won't stop.

10:06.360 --> 10:08.460
10cc's epinephrine, fast.

10:08.890 --> 10:11.810
Piggy-back IV.

10:11.900 --> 10:13.430
[machine beating]

10:15.000 --> 10:16.410
He's fibrillating!

10:17.000 --> 10:19.980
Heart paddles. Heart paddles.

10:23.910 --> 10:25.220
Stay back.

11:43.150 --> 11:44.290
[machine beeping]

11:47.160 --> 11:50.000

Oncology 629.

12:16.050 --> 12:17.800
Oncology 629.

12:41.210 --> 12:42.490
[alarm ringing]

13:00.700 --> 13:01.940
Get him back.

13:03.400 --> 13:04.400
You shouldn't be here.

13:04.470 --> 13:06.310
This floor is private. Get lost!

13:07.170 --> 13:08.380
Now!

13:09.370 --> 13:10.480
Sorry.

13:14.350 --> 13:16.850
I thought you said that elevator was fixed.

13:16.910 --> 13:19.190
It just came up here with
someone from downstairs.

13:19.250 --> 13:22.130
Make sure it doesn't happen again.

13:27.960 --> 13:29.130
Where am I?

13:29.660 --> 13:31.610
You're in a hospital.

13:31.730 --> 13:33.680
You were in a helicopter crash.

13:36.170 --> 13:38.310
Wait. How long have I been here?

13:38.440 --> 13:39.410
[panting]

13:39.470 --> 13:40.410
Shh.

13:40.470 --> 13:41.750
Rest now.

13:42.870 --> 13:44.850
Doctor Rothchild has been called for.

13:45.640 --> 13:48.090
And he'll answer all your
questions when he gets here.

13:48.150 --> 13:49.320
What day is this?

13:50.280 --> 13:51.560
It's Wednesday.

13:51.620 --> 13:53.290
I have to make a phone call.

13:54.020 --> 13:55.050
I have to call Dom.

13:55.120 --> 13:56.460
(Simmons) You will have to wait.

13:56.520 --> 13:57.520
It can't wait.

13:57.590 --> 13:59.190
(Rothchild) It already has, Mr. Hawke.

13:59.260 --> 14:01.830
You've been comatose for
the better part of a year.

14:05.360 --> 14:06.840
My name is Dr. Rothchild.

14:07.630 --> 14:08.580
I've been your physician

14:08.600 --> 14:10.670
for the past eight-and-a-half months.

14:22.980 --> 14:23.750
Your pupils are working like

14:23.780 --> 14:26.020
the aperture of an expensive camera.

14:26.920 --> 14:27.990
It's a good sign.

14:29.050 --> 14:30.760
What is that thing?

14:30.890 --> 14:32.630
This is an EEG machine.

14:33.490 --> 14:35.660
Records the electrical impulses in the brain.

14:36.260 --> 14:38.470
It tells us if there's been any damage done.

14:41.930 --> 14:43.240
There's no chance of...

14:43.300 --> 14:44.280
(Rothchild) There's always a chance

14:44.300 --> 14:46.780
when someone's been comatose for a long time.

14:48.910 --> 14:50.820
Do you remember anything of the crash?

14:52.280 --> 14:53.650
Bits and pieces. I...

14:53.710 --> 14:55.450
We think that you had a heart seizure

14:55.510 --> 14:57.220
at the controls of your helicopter.

14:57.320 --> 14:58.890
Shortly after you arrived here,

14:58.950 --> 15:00.790
you went into complete cardiac arrest.

15:01.290 --> 15:04.130
So, clinically, you were
gone for several minutes.

15:06.720 --> 15:09.900
Did a man namedâ€¦ Dominic Santini

15:09.960 --> 15:11.300
come to see me?

15:13.630 --> 15:14.840
There's lots of news

15:14.900 --> 15:16.740
that you have to catch up on, Mr. Hawke.

15:17.100 --> 15:18.480
It's best that we move slowly.

15:18.540 --> 15:19.570
Doctor,

15:20.440 --> 15:22.250
that's a pretty simple question.

15:22.370 --> 15:24.180
Did Dominic come to see me?

15:27.980 --> 15:29.080
Sat in that chair

15:29.150 --> 15:30.850
and he talked to you for hours on end.

15:30.920 --> 15:32.450
He was convinced you could hear him,

15:32.520 --> 15:34.050
even though you didn't answer.

15:35.550 --> 15:36.830
He was a good friend.

15:39.060 --> 15:40.400
What do you mean "was"?

15:41.560 --> 15:43.160
Mr. Santini is dead.

15:50.170 --> 15:51.340
How!?

15:52.800 --> 15:54.340
He and several other men raided

15:54.410 --> 15:55.680
a prison camp in North Vietnam

15:55.740 --> 15:58.550
that was still holding Americans prisoner.

15:58.880 --> 16:01.250
Your brother, Sin Jin, was among them.

16:01.310 --> 16:02.350
He was rescued,

16:02.380 --> 16:06.160
but Mr. Santini and another man
were killed in the process.

16:06.220 --> 16:07.250
Sin Jin's here?

16:07.320 --> 16:08.390
Yes.

16:08.450 --> 16:10.930
He is on his way back
from Alexandria, Virginia.

16:11.020 --> 16:13.200
We called him last night when you came to.

16:13.930 --> 16:15.300
When was this raid?

16:16.960 --> 16:18.570
Who's the other man?

16:18.630 --> 16:22.040
The raid wasâ€¦ was way back in July.

16:22.330 --> 16:26.840
The other man was a man
named Goldsmith-Briggs.

16:29.270 --> 16:30.480
[sighs]

16:30.540 --> 16:31.750
Archangel.

16:33.980 --> 16:35.180
(Rothchild) He's been told.

16:35.250 --> 16:36.620
What do you mean?

16:36.850 --> 16:38.590
You told him? Just point-blank?

16:38.650 --> 16:39.820
What else could I do?

16:39.880 --> 16:40.990
He asked me straight out.

16:41.320 --> 16:43.600
You were wrong to overload him so quickly.

16:44.060 --> 16:46.590
We're dealing with a year
of his life that's gone.

16:47.060 --> 16:49.300
It's extremely difficult to assimilate.

16:49.430 --> 16:51.700
I wish you'd called me first.

16:52.030 --> 16:53.570
If you're so concerned, Doctor,

16:53.630 --> 16:54.840
I suggest you get over there

16:54.900 --> 16:56.710
and begin the therapeutic process.

16:57.200 --> 16:58.680
Do you agree?

17:03.110 --> 17:04.109
[dialing]

17:12.380 --> 17:13.450
He's been told.

17:14.650 --> 17:17.599
No, he actually took it
quite well, considering.

17:19.160 --> 17:20.290
He's very strong.

17:20.530 --> 17:22.730
[chattering on TV]

17:23.160 --> 17:24.430
[male TV anchor] From Great Britain

17:24.500 --> 17:25.970
the news of Lady Di's

17:26.030 --> 17:27.770
filing for divorce from Prince Charles

17:27.829 --> 17:30.400
has come as quite a shock to both families,

17:30.470 --> 17:33.040
as well as society columnists
all over the world.

17:33.300 --> 17:34.870
Margo, what do you think about that?

17:34.940 --> 17:37.650
(Margo) Well, who could have
predicted it a few months ago?

17:37.710 --> 17:39.920
(male anchor) It seems to me,
I recall seeing a tabloid

17:39.980 --> 17:41.890
on my market checkout counter

17:41.950 --> 17:43.790
that spoke of it being a possibility.

17:44.350 --> 17:46.490
I wonder what her settlement will be?

17:47.350 --> 17:49.890
Probably, they will split the crown jewels.

17:56.730 --> 17:59.330
(woman on PA system) Doctor Barr, 377.

17:59.930 --> 18:02.500
Doctor Barr, call 377.

18:42.170 --> 18:43.350
[knocking on door]

18:45.440 --> 18:46.440
I'm Dr. Holgate.

18:46.480 --> 18:48.390
May I talk with you for a moment?

18:50.580 --> 18:51.580
Yeah.

18:55.090 --> 18:56.090
Oh.

18:57.860 --> 18:59.160
[sighs]

18:59.220 --> 19:01.360
I see they'veâ€¦ they've given you the articles

19:01.430 --> 19:03.130
that they were saving for you.

19:03.730 --> 19:05.400
Your emotions must be going

19:05.460 --> 19:07.570
in a lot of different
directions at the moment.

A good friend dead,

19:08.870 --> 19:11.070

19:11.140 --> 19:13.640
A year gone by without being accounted for.

You're a shrink.

19:15.570 --> 19:16.570
[chuckles]

19:16.640 --> 19:18.280
I wondered when they'd send you in.

19:18.780 --> 19:20.950
You think I'm standard operating procedure,

19:21.010 --> 19:22.010
do you?

19:22.810 --> 19:24.090
For the Firm you are.

19:24.150 --> 19:25.180
Huh-huh.

19:25.250 --> 19:26.960
That is who's paying for this, isn't it?

19:27.020 --> 19:28.020
Huh-huh.

19:28.090 --> 19:29.120
[sighs]

19:29.190 --> 19:31.390
What the hell is that stuff they're giving me?

19:32.360 --> 19:34.630
Just a 5% glucose solution.

19:35.430 --> 19:36.460
They'll disconnect it

19:36.530 --> 19:38.340
when you start eating solid foods again.

19:39.960 --> 19:42.240
And what's making me so groggy?

19:42.370 --> 19:44.640
Well, you've been hibernating almost a year.

19:45.540 --> 19:47.280
Your metabolism has slowed down

19:47.340 --> 19:50.150
to a crawl. Your muscles have atrophied.

19:51.540 --> 19:54.020
It's the same thing up there.

19:54.680 --> 19:57.090
Your synapses slow down from lack of use.

19:57.850 --> 20:00.760
You feel groggy, logy, punchy.

20:01.950 --> 20:03.430
You'll feel better in time.

20:05.720 --> 20:07.130
I'll come back tomorrow.

20:10.290 --> 20:12.000
(woman on PA system) Attention please.

20:12.060 --> 20:12.730
There is a blue Chevrolet

20:12.760 --> 20:15.070
blocking the emergency ambulance entrance.

20:15.470 --> 20:16.810
There is a blue Chevrolet

20:16.900 --> 20:18.740
blocking the emergency ambulance entrance.

20:24.880 --> 20:25.410
[beeping]

20:36.290 --> 20:38.130
I didn't know they were getting divorced.

20:38.190 --> 20:40.070
Yeah, life is unpredictable, isn't it?

20:40.890 --> 20:41.890
Yeah.

20:44.460 --> 20:45.630
This must be your floor.

20:45.700 --> 20:47.940
Oh, yeah. Yours, too. Doesn't go any further.

20:48.600 --> 20:50.140
Does if you have a key.

20:50.200 --> 20:52.200
(woman on PA system) Dr. Stevens, Pediatrics.

20:52.870 --> 20:53.850
Bye.

20:53.900 --> 20:54.970
Bye. Have a nice day.

21:01.810 --> 21:03.120
(Lisa) Stringfellow,

21:04.450 --> 21:06.020
you have a visitor.

21:24.500 --> 21:25.500
Well?

21:31.880 --> 21:33.080
Sin Jin?

21:34.550 --> 21:35.550
Yeah.

21:47.730 --> 21:48.860
You look great.

21:49.630 --> 21:50.940
So do you.

21:51.560 --> 21:55.100
Considering what I saw here 3 months ago.

21:59.370 --> 22:01.510
(TV announcer) Press
representatives were called

22:01.570 --> 22:03.380
to Buckingham Palace yesterday afternoon

22:03.440 --> 22:05.550
to hear Her Majesty's Press Secretary

22:05.610 --> 22:07.210
read a short statement describing

22:07.280 --> 22:08.420
what many suspected

22:08.480 --> 22:10.930
and what now has been confirmed,

22:11.120 --> 22:12.990
that Prince Charles and Lady Di

22:13.050 --> 22:14.460
have called it a day.

22:14.520 --> 22:16.090
Parliament has issued a blackout...

22:16.150 --> 22:19.000
Prince Charles and Lady Diana. Sick.

22:19.090 --> 22:21.230
What's the world coming to?

22:22.790 --> 22:24.800
The brothers are getting along famously.

22:25.060 --> 22:26.770
(Rothchild) I commend you, Dr. Holgate.

22:28.330 --> 22:29.740
I could talk to him tonight.

22:30.330 --> 22:31.470
Too soon.

22:31.670 --> 22:32.840
(Abrams) Why?

22:33.540 --> 22:35.740
For one thing, he's still terribly groggy.

22:36.470 --> 22:38.080
He won't be able to help you.

22:38.610 --> 22:40.450
Reduce his medication a little bit.

22:40.610 --> 22:41.920
If I did that,

22:42.080 --> 22:45.320
the whole house of cards
would come tumbling down.

22:45.380 --> 22:48.390
(Lisa) The methods we're employing
are simply not foolproof.

22:49.550 --> 22:51.230
You both seem to forget that.

22:52.590 --> 22:53.970
Reduce his medication.

22:54.960 --> 22:58.240
(Abrams) The longer the delay,
the greater the external risk.

22:58.300 --> 23:00.000
Now, I want us all on that plane

23:00.100 --> 23:01.580
this time tomorrow.

23:02.200 --> 23:03.200
[horn honks]

23:05.940 --> 23:09.110
You know, it's funny, but
I was confined to a cell

23:09.140 --> 23:12.180
maybe a third the size of this room.

23:13.340 --> 23:15.150
But I learned to have total freedom

23:15.350 --> 23:16.690
in my mind here.

23:17.580 --> 23:18.650
I used to think through

23:18.680 --> 23:21.690
some of the most incredibly detailed projects.

23:21.750 --> 23:23.660
I built a house once. It wasâ€¦

23:23.790 --> 23:25.700
I cut every 2-by-4 in my mind,

23:25.820 --> 23:27.200
hammered in every nail.

23:27.860 --> 23:28.960
It was my dream house.

23:29.030 --> 23:31.010
It took me about 6 months to do that one.

23:32.030 --> 23:33.200
A bloody horror.

23:35.130 --> 23:38.380
Yeah, but it's all over now,
thanks to your friends.

23:41.170 --> 23:42.840
How did Dominic die?

23:44.340 --> 23:45.580
It was quick.

23:46.410 --> 23:48.220
The unit had 3 choppers,

23:48.380 --> 23:51.090
2 Chinooks and a Cobra for air support.

23:52.450 --> 23:54.990
Dom and Archangel were in the Cobra.

23:55.620 --> 23:58.000
They took some small-arms fire on the way out,

23:58.790 --> 24:01.070
flew about 5 or 6 more miles,

24:01.790 --> 24:03.140
then went in.

24:05.100 --> 24:06.600
No chance they survived?

24:06.660 --> 24:07.670
No.

24:08.770 --> 24:11.140
It looked like napalm
when they hit the ground.

24:14.640 --> 24:15.670
Tired?

24:17.570 --> 24:20.450
Yeah, it's too good a day.

24:21.250 --> 24:23.280
I don't want it to end.

24:23.350 --> 24:27.060
(woman on PA system) Doctors Levine and
Patterson, please pick up your messages.

24:28.720 --> 24:29.750
[knocking]

24:29.820 --> 24:30.920
Sorry to interrupt.

24:30.990 --> 24:33.090
No, you're not interrupting. I'm just leaving.

24:33.460 --> 24:35.230
String would like to know when I canâ€¦

24:35.290 --> 24:36.600
I can take him home.

24:36.990 --> 24:38.700
I think in about a week or so.

24:40.830 --> 24:42.810
This is Morton Abrams, Mr. Hawke.

24:43.100 --> 24:44.310
Do you have the energy to talk

24:44.370 --> 24:45.750
to him for a couple of minutes?

24:50.140 --> 24:51.120
I'll see you tomorrow.

24:51.180 --> 24:52.210
I'll walk with you.

24:54.410 --> 24:55.580
Do you mind?

24:55.950 --> 24:56.950
No.

24:57.280 --> 24:58.850
I assume you have a pretty good idea

24:58.920 --> 25:00.160
where I'm from.

25:01.050 --> 25:02.330
The Firm.

25:07.520 --> 25:09.000
Archangel's replacement.

25:09.430 --> 25:11.630
Not really, just the man who got his job.

25:11.700 --> 25:13.830
He wasâ€¦ rather unique.

25:14.130 --> 25:16.440
(woman on PA system) Doctor Levy to admitting.

25:17.600 --> 25:20.010
Iâ€¦ have to clear up a few details, such as

25:20.070 --> 25:22.410
a piece of US Government hardware.

25:23.810 --> 25:24.950
Airwolf.

25:26.410 --> 25:29.080
Since you don't seem to have
any further use for it...

25:32.280 --> 25:33.590
Now, if we could clear up

25:33.650 --> 25:35.490
this little piece of business now,

25:35.990 --> 25:38.160
I could return to Virginia tonight.

25:45.030 --> 25:47.980
Do you have a Las Vegas area sectional map?

25:49.170 --> 25:50.670
I can have one in a minute.

26:07.020 --> 26:08.020
It's in the desert,

26:08.090 --> 26:09.620
a place called Valley of the Gods.

26:10.350 --> 26:12.100
Excellent. That's excellent.

26:12.660 --> 26:14.640
(woman on PA system) Oncology 629.

26:14.690 --> 26:16.330
Oncologyâ€¦

26:27.370 --> 26:29.820
Stage 1 is now complete, ladies and gentlemen.

26:29.870 --> 26:31.180
I commend you all.

26:31.240 --> 26:33.410
Your commendation will be better appreciated

26:33.480 --> 26:35.290
in the form of a nice fat check.

26:35.880 --> 26:38.330
I'm sure you'll be quite
well-compensated, Peter.

26:38.380 --> 26:41.120
Should I prepare Mr. Hawke for traveling?

26:41.290 --> 26:44.600
Yes, our Libyan friends
are dying to meet him again.

26:46.160 --> 26:47.790
Shall we begin Stage 2?

26:52.800 --> 26:56.270
(woman on PA system) Dr. Barr,
call 377. Dr. Barr.

27:27.700 --> 27:30.300
Doctor Huggins, please call 617.

27:31.070 --> 27:34.210
Doctor Huggins, please call 617.

28:12.080 --> 28:14.420
Doctor Higgins, please call 617.

28:14.650 --> 28:17.630
Doctor Higgins, please call 617.

28:37.630 --> 28:38.810
Hold still.

28:38.870 --> 28:39.970
[choking]

28:40.040 --> 28:42.040
Hold still. All I want
from you is today's date.

28:46.040 --> 28:47.280
Saturday, March 3.

28:47.340 --> 28:48.650
What year?

28:48.780 --> 28:50.090
1984.

28:54.320 --> 28:55.590
Calluses.

28:56.920 --> 28:58.230
Sure are.

28:58.290 --> 29:00.460
I wouldn't have calluses

29:00.520 --> 29:03.000
if I'd been in a coma for a year, would I?

29:07.360 --> 29:11.280
(woman on PA system) Control to all
units, advise that a 407 occurred...

29:19.710 --> 29:20.710
[brakes screeching]

29:23.110 --> 29:26.030
Looks like the vehicle had dual rear wheels.

29:26.080 --> 29:27.150
A truck, maybe.

29:27.220 --> 29:28.560
Are there any fingerprints

29:28.620 --> 29:30.120
other than Hawke's in the cockpit?

29:30.190 --> 29:32.500
(Charlene) They're trying
to lift some right now.

29:33.820 --> 29:34.890
Dom.

29:42.630 --> 29:44.040
Is that the ship he borrowed?

29:44.100 --> 29:45.270
Yeah.

29:45.540 --> 29:47.540
Is there any sign of foul play?

29:48.470 --> 29:50.580
No. It's completely undamaged.

29:50.710 --> 29:52.810
Apparently, it was just landed here.

29:55.010 --> 29:56.080
Follow me.

29:56.150 --> 29:58.290
There's something else I want you to see.

30:09.460 --> 30:11.000
[machine beeps]

30:11.230 --> 30:12.400
(Dominic) Who are they?

30:12.800 --> 30:14.610
These 3 belong to an East German

30:14.670 --> 30:16.510
spy organization, Schwartzkrieg.

30:17.530 --> 30:21.180
Klaus Kinter, Else Mannheim, Eric Maas.

30:23.040 --> 30:25.350
Anastasia Zarkov, Russian.

30:26.110 --> 30:28.280
She's a specialist in things psychological

30:28.350 --> 30:31.330
as they apply to the intelligence trade.

30:31.480 --> 30:32.860
Over the past couple of years

30:32.920 --> 30:33.890
she's been quite active

30:33.950 --> 30:36.330
in behavior-modifying drug research.

30:36.390 --> 30:38.420
Peter MacGregor Moore, English.

30:38.490 --> 30:39.490
[Marella laughs]

30:39.560 --> 30:41.130
A mercenary who'll work for anybody

30:41.190 --> 30:42.430
with change in their pocket.

30:42.860 --> 30:44.130
Right, left, or center,

30:44.190 --> 30:45.300
their political persuasion

30:45.330 --> 30:47.540
means nothing to him in any way.

30:49.000 --> 30:52.040
Well, what's all these got
to do with Stringfellow Hawke?

30:52.100 --> 30:53.100
2 weeks ago,

30:53.170 --> 30:54.980
Army Intelligence stumbled onto the fact

30:55.040 --> 30:57.880
that this happy group
had arrived in the States.

30:57.940 --> 31:00.290
Obviously, they were
on a mission of some kind.

31:00.340 --> 31:01.410
There's reason to believe that

31:01.450 --> 31:03.720
they're working for Mustapha Kamal.

31:04.410 --> 31:05.480
So?

31:05.550 --> 31:08.220
So, if you had to speculate, what single thing

31:08.290 --> 31:09.920
would Qaddafi like to get his hands on

31:09.990 --> 31:11.660
more than anything else in the world?

31:11.720 --> 31:13.260
Come on, quit your kidding, will you?

31:13.320 --> 31:14.300
Airwolf, of course.

31:14.360 --> 31:17.270
Exactly. Then Hawke disappears.

31:17.330 --> 31:19.530
24 hours later, we find his helicopter

31:19.600 --> 31:21.770
out here in a field in the middle of nowhere.

31:22.330 --> 31:24.280
You think he had a run-in with these guys?

31:24.330 --> 31:26.040
I'd bet on it.

31:27.370 --> 31:31.050
Dominic, you know where Airwolf is.

31:31.440 --> 31:32.920
You've got to tell me.

31:32.980 --> 31:33.980
Uh-huh.

31:34.040 --> 31:35.220
It could fall into

31:35.280 --> 31:37.350
the very worst possible hands.

31:37.410 --> 31:39.290
I can't. I gave String my word.

31:39.350 --> 31:41.090
Right now, there is no String.

31:41.150 --> 31:42.860
He's been gone over 30 hours.

31:42.950 --> 31:44.230
That's why that chopper is just

31:44.290 --> 31:46.230
sitting out there in the middle of nowhere.

31:47.290 --> 31:48.890
[typing]

31:54.000 --> 31:56.480
Well, how do I know this
isn't some kind of fancy scam

31:56.530 --> 31:58.380
to get me to tell you where Airwolf is?

31:58.440 --> 32:00.510
Because it doesn't make any sense.

32:00.570 --> 32:02.680
You know what arrangements we have with Hawke.

32:02.740 --> 32:04.620
We're on his side.

32:04.740 --> 32:07.380
Well, that was yesterday. What about today?

32:07.810 --> 32:09.220
You people have a funny way

32:09.280 --> 32:11.320
of changing sides to suit
your needs, you know.

32:11.380 --> 32:12.860
- I resent that.
- Ohâ€¦?

32:12.920 --> 32:14.520
Marella. Marella.

32:15.520 --> 32:19.160
Dominic, we're not just talking about Airwolf.

32:20.060 --> 32:22.230
We're talking about Hawke's life.

32:22.930 --> 32:24.870
You've got to trust me.

32:36.310 --> 32:38.510
I don't. No.

32:38.580 --> 32:40.020
I don't.

32:40.210 --> 32:41.210
Dominic!

32:44.750 --> 32:46.660
I'm not with them, whoever they are.

32:47.620 --> 32:48.790
Maybe.

32:49.790 --> 32:51.130
But Sin Jin is.

32:51.250 --> 32:52.600
That doesn't make any sense.

32:52.660 --> 32:54.290
(woman on PA system) Hematology, 111.

32:54.390 --> 32:55.600
Hematology, 111.

32:55.660 --> 32:56.760
Unless...

32:57.890 --> 32:59.310
Unless what?

33:03.270 --> 33:05.140
If you're lying to me,

33:06.900 --> 33:08.250
you're dead.

33:08.310 --> 33:10.010
I'm not lying.

33:10.570 --> 33:12.280
I hope not.

33:31.030 --> 33:32.510
Good morning.

33:36.000 --> 33:37.310
Else!

33:39.700 --> 33:40.700
There.

34:11.199 --> 34:12.610
Who are they?

34:12.670 --> 34:14.010
My brother, Sin Jin.

34:15.010 --> 34:16.310
Which one?

34:17.070 --> 34:18.350
What?

34:18.409 --> 34:19.940
Which one is your brother Sin Jin?

34:20.010 --> 34:21.350
There are 2 photos.

34:21.610 --> 34:22.920
That's Sin Jin.

34:23.050 --> 34:24.550
No, these are 2 different men.

34:47.199 --> 34:48.610
Hey, come on. Quick, quick.

34:55.080 --> 34:56.580
There never was a crash.

34:56.710 --> 34:58.320
They just wanted me to think so.

34:59.850 --> 35:01.420
Sin Jin is not back.

35:02.190 --> 35:03.060
What is it?

35:03.090 --> 35:04.960
Brainwashing or something like that?

35:05.020 --> 35:06.260
Something like that.

35:06.820 --> 35:09.100
I told them exactly what
they wanted me to tell them.

35:09.160 --> 35:10.930
What did you tell them?

35:10.990 --> 35:11.970
The location of

35:12.030 --> 35:13.910
a very important piece of military hardware.

35:13.960 --> 35:14.970
Are they spies?

35:15.030 --> 35:16.940
Do you work for the government or something?

35:19.340 --> 35:20.610
Nothing that patriotic.

35:20.670 --> 35:22.240
Hawke here, he works for himself.

35:22.910 --> 35:24.610
Himself and the, Firm, I should say.

35:24.670 --> 35:25.980
Right, brother dear?

35:27.980 --> 35:29.720
I'll blow her away.

35:30.950 --> 35:31.950
Let's go.

35:48.970 --> 35:49.600
All right, brother.

35:49.630 --> 35:51.540
Why not live a little longer?

35:51.600 --> 35:53.640
If you wanted me dead, I'd already be there.

35:53.700 --> 35:56.510
There is a bonus if we get you to Libya alive.

35:56.670 --> 35:58.350
I should've died in that copter crash.

35:58.410 --> 35:59.610
There was no crash.

36:00.040 --> 36:03.120
Your helicopter was pre-rigged
with a radio control device

36:03.180 --> 36:05.090
and landed beautifully by MacGregor.

36:07.980 --> 36:09.520
What made me pass out?

36:09.590 --> 36:12.090
The photograph I gave you
was soaked in a chemical.

36:12.160 --> 36:13.190
Nasty chemical.

36:13.260 --> 36:15.240
Enters the bloodstream right through the skin.

36:15.290 --> 36:17.270
I was wearing gloves, remember?

36:20.500 --> 36:22.140
What about her? She's not part of this.

36:22.200 --> 36:23.800
(Hawke) Why don't you let her go?

36:24.470 --> 36:25.880
I don't think so, Hawke.

36:26.970 --> 36:28.710
She might prove too valuable.

36:44.850 --> 36:45.860
[propellers starting]

37:04.610 --> 37:05.780
That's not going to work.

37:05.910 --> 37:07.080
You might as well relax.

37:09.550 --> 37:11.180
Harry Houdini did it.

37:12.820 --> 37:14.160
Why Libya?

37:15.320 --> 37:16.320
[sighs]

37:18.520 --> 37:20.330
I vacationed there once.

37:21.460 --> 37:23.030
You vacationed in Libya?

37:27.400 --> 37:28.840
You think we'll go nonstop?

37:28.900 --> 37:31.810
No, I got a stopover in
Cuba or maybe Nicaragua.

37:32.300 --> 37:33.580
I hope it's Cuba.

37:33.640 --> 37:35.480
I always wanted a Caribbean vacation.

37:39.210 --> 37:41.090
Do you do things like this everyday?

37:56.730 --> 37:58.670
There! There it is!

37:59.630 --> 38:01.610
Is that smooth enough for you to set down?

38:01.730 --> 38:03.710
Should think so. Yes.

38:10.940 --> 38:12.610
Brace yourselves!

38:44.610 --> 38:46.850
How'd you like to be untied, Stringfellow?

38:48.440 --> 38:50.010
In exchange for what?

38:50.080 --> 38:52.420
A little flying, just 5 minutes' worth.

38:52.950 --> 38:54.050
I don't think so.

38:57.820 --> 38:59.200
You can't shoot me.

38:59.260 --> 39:01.240
No one else can get Airwolf out of the lair.

39:01.290 --> 39:04.670
You're right, Hawke. We wouldn't shoot you.

39:36.230 --> 39:37.730
This is bloody awesome.

39:37.830 --> 39:38.830
(Hawke) Yeah.

39:44.100 --> 39:45.100
[beeping]

40:36.290 --> 40:37.860
[conveyor belt whirring]

40:55.610 --> 40:56.640
Let's go.

41:09.390 --> 41:11.130
That's what they were after?

41:11.190 --> 41:13.670
All this for a lousy helicopter?

41:15.530 --> 41:16.630
Yeah.

41:23.570 --> 41:24.570
[thudding]

41:28.970 --> 41:31.380
(Kinter) How long to reach
international waters?

41:31.440 --> 41:33.480
15 minutes to the Gulf.

41:33.610 --> 41:35.650
3 more and we're 12 miles out.

41:35.710 --> 41:37.420
The escort will join us there.

41:37.750 --> 41:39.450
Fantastic.

41:47.060 --> 41:48.060
Hawke.

41:49.330 --> 41:50.900
Relax, brother.

41:51.090 --> 41:52.100
Um,

41:53.060 --> 41:55.770
why don't you let me loosen her straps?

41:56.000 --> 41:57.480
(Hawke) We can't go anywhere now.

41:57.530 --> 41:59.600
Then she won't need her arms free, will she?

42:01.500 --> 42:02.980
(Hawke) How about you, Freda?

42:03.110 --> 42:04.590
You wanna be a little sympathetic?

42:04.870 --> 42:06.480
You could go back into yours.

42:08.880 --> 42:09.950
Not likely.

42:10.010 --> 42:11.080
(Dominic) Don't move

42:11.150 --> 42:14.220
or the next word you say could be "goodbye."

42:21.060 --> 42:22.630
Time to call up the escort.

42:23.860 --> 42:27.170
[Speaking Spanish]

42:27.960 --> 42:30.000
So, I didn't know what to do.

42:30.470 --> 42:32.470
So, I, uh, flew out to the Valley

42:32.600 --> 42:35.080
and hid in Airwolf and I waited.

42:36.470 --> 42:37.920
How long were you going to wait?

42:38.040 --> 42:39.520
Long as it took.

42:41.880 --> 42:42.950
Now what?

42:47.320 --> 42:49.320
Well, looks like

42:49.390 --> 42:51.490
we're gonna miss our Mediterranean vacation.

42:51.550 --> 42:53.630
It is the tourist season.

42:53.760 --> 42:55.000
[Dominic exclaims]

42:57.890 --> 42:59.130
(Kinter) Here they come.

43:00.660 --> 43:02.170
Damn it, we did it.

43:02.830 --> 43:03.830
[beeping]

43:06.070 --> 43:08.070
Rear cargo doors. It could be trouble.

43:08.240 --> 43:09.680
[beeping continues]

43:09.810 --> 43:11.340
I'll go take a look.

43:31.890 --> 43:33.430
Release the drag chute.

43:42.740 --> 43:43.880
(Hawke) Engage both engines.

43:43.940 --> 43:44.920
Both at once?

43:44.970 --> 43:46.080
Now!

43:48.010 --> 43:49.180
Cut the chute away.

44:29.920 --> 44:31.230
[Speaking Spanish]

44:31.550 --> 44:33.190
[Speaking Spanish]

44:40.800 --> 44:41.800
[continuing to speak Spanish]

45:00.080 --> 45:01.760
We've have some MiGs on our tail.

45:03.850 --> 45:05.090
Pop a Sun Burst.

46:19.460 --> 46:20.460
No!

46:46.460 --> 46:48.330
(Hawke) Where's that other MiG?

46:49.090 --> 46:51.700
They're heading home. They've had it!

46:52.560 --> 46:55.100
That makes 2 of us. Let's go home.

47:14.750 --> 47:16.890
You don't have a home of your own?

47:17.350 --> 47:18.990
Of course we do.

47:19.960 --> 47:22.600
And offices in a half-dozen locations.

47:24.060 --> 47:26.170
Then how come you're always here?

47:26.230 --> 47:28.040
(Archangel) You flew in with Dom.

47:28.430 --> 47:30.170
Didn't he tell you that we found

47:30.230 --> 47:32.010
your helicopter in the desert?

47:32.200 --> 47:33.310
Yeah.

47:33.970 --> 47:35.110
Well?

47:35.240 --> 47:36.380
Well what?

47:36.640 --> 47:37.780
Well, what happened?

47:37.840 --> 47:39.220
Did the Schwartzkrieg grab you?

47:39.280 --> 47:41.760
Did they get Airwolf? I mean, is it safe?

47:42.180 --> 47:43.620
Are they still in the country?

47:43.680 --> 47:47.290
I don't know. Yes. No. In that order.

47:48.550 --> 47:49.660
Good.

47:49.790 --> 47:51.060
How'd you get away?

47:51.120 --> 47:52.600
He dumped his helicopter

47:52.660 --> 47:54.360
out of the back of a cargo plane.

47:56.730 --> 47:58.330
You had a civilian with you?

47:58.390 --> 48:00.600
I'm no civilian, I'm a nurse.

48:02.930 --> 48:04.840
Susan helped me escape.

48:06.000 --> 48:08.610
So, she knows where Airwolf is hidden?

48:08.800 --> 48:11.410
Is that what you call his helicopter?

48:14.010 --> 48:15.680
We didn't tell her the name.

48:15.750 --> 48:18.250
We thought we'd keep that from her.

48:21.280 --> 48:22.630
So, she knows where it is?

48:23.090 --> 48:24.460
Sorta.

48:24.520 --> 48:25.520
Sorta?

48:25.590 --> 48:26.590
Well...

48:27.620 --> 48:29.190
Should I tell him?

48:29.330 --> 48:30.900
I don't think so.

48:31.190 --> 48:32.760
(Dominic) You're right, String.

48:32.830 --> 48:35.000
Michael's such a blabbermouth.

48:35.160 --> 48:36.940
This isn't humorous.

48:37.070 --> 48:39.740
Oh. Hey, look. I really don't know.

48:39.800 --> 48:42.720
I saw a lot of snow and a lot of scenery

48:42.770 --> 48:44.980
and it all went by very fast.

48:45.240 --> 48:47.850
Besides, I was asleep when we landed.

48:48.910 --> 48:49.910
Thank God.

48:49.980 --> 48:51.120
Sorta.

48:52.250 --> 48:53.250
[laughing]
