THANK YOU FOR THE DANCE.

21:03.128 --> 21:06.064
OH. UM, YEAH.

21:06.064 --> 21:09.501
I'M SORRY THAT MY DATE

21:09.501 --> 21:13.338
I GUESS WE BOTH

21:13.338 --> 21:14.806
YOU HAVE NO IDEA.

21:14.806 --> 21:17.843

21:28.553 --> 21:31.089
BUT I'M SORRY
I TRIED TO SUCK THE SOULS

21:31.089 --> 21:33.025
OUT OF ALL YOUR FRIENDS
AT THE DANCE.

21:33.025 --> 21:36.228
HEY, YOU WARNED ME
YOU NEEDED TO GET HOME
11 TIMES.

21:36.228 --> 21:39.131

I'M JUST GLAD
EVERYONE'S SOULS

21:52.978 --> 21:55.914
