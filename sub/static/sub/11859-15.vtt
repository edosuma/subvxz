WEBVTT

00:04.750 --> 00:06.041
(Jeff)
'Come on, mom.'

00:06.125 --> 00:07.125
'You know I'll get
more out of college'

00:07.208 --> 00:08.750
'if I take a year off first.'

00:08.834 --> 00:10.917
(Leigh)
'A lot can change
in a year, Jeff.'

00:11.000 --> 00:12.709
'People lose perspective.'

00:12.792 --> 00:14.083
(Jeff)
'Lose perspective?'

00:14.166 --> 00:16.083
'You're talking
to the class president'

00:16.166 --> 00:17.375
'captain of the track team'

00:17.458 --> 00:20.000
'four hundred meter dash
state record holder.'

00:20.083 --> 00:21.500
(Leigh)
'Save it, Carl Lewis.'

00:21.583 --> 00:23.417
'What do you plan
to do during this so-called'

00:23.500 --> 00:25.792
'self enlightening sabbatical?'

00:25.875 --> 00:26.917
(Jeff)
'Travel.'

00:27.000 --> 00:28.250
'I'm going
to backpack around'

00:28.333 --> 00:29.709
'and get jobs when
I run out of money.'

00:29.792 --> 00:30.959
(Leigh)
'What kind of jobs?'

00:31.041 --> 00:32.917
'A clue for the
less enlightened.'

00:33.000 --> 00:35.250
(Jeff)
'Uh, teaching
English in Beijing..'

00:35.333 --> 00:36.583
'...picking
artichokes in Spain.'

00:36.667 --> 00:37.875
(Leigh)
'That sounds very romantic.'

00:37.959 --> 00:39.291
'But what's
wrong with a semester'

00:39.375 --> 00:40.792
'abroad once
you're at Cornell?'

00:40.875 --> 00:43.291
(Jeff)
'You don't go abroad
until you're a junior.'

00:43.375 --> 00:45.709
'That's four years away.
And I'm burnt out now.'

00:45.792 --> 00:49.125
'You don't want me turning into
some mental case, do you, mom?'

00:49.208 --> 00:51.959
(Leigh)
'You care
to weigh in here, Ben?'

00:58.875 --> 01:01.291
Are you even listening?

01:01.375 --> 01:02.625
Yeah.

01:02.709 --> 01:04.333
Artichokes.

01:07.125 --> 01:09.458
The first time you're home for
dinner, you're not really home.

01:09.542 --> 01:11.625
He's 17.
He doesn't have to figure out

01:11.709 --> 01:13.750
his future before dessert.

01:35.792 --> 01:36.875
We got to go.

01:48.291 --> 01:49.291
Honey?

01:49.375 --> 01:52.625
This is Tom
Parker.
He's, uh..

01:52.709 --> 01:54.625
He's a US Marshal.

01:54.709 --> 01:55.917
A US Marshal?

01:56.000 --> 01:57.542
- 'What's going on?'
- Dad?

01:58.875 --> 02:00.625
You can use these to pack.

02:00.709 --> 02:02.166
Pack what?

02:02.250 --> 02:04.166
Whatever you want
to take with you.

02:06.917 --> 02:08.125
Where are we
going? I don't understand.

02:08.208 --> 02:10.667
- What's going on, mom?
- Ben, talk to me.

02:10.750 --> 02:14.500
Tom's gonna help us.
Everything's gonna to be
fine.

02:14.583 --> 02:16.500
(Ben)
'But we need to go.'

02:16.583 --> 02:17.917
Now.

02:35.667 --> 02:37.125
(Jeffries)
'It's a specialized system.'

02:37.208 --> 02:39.625
Not some push-and-play
you get at the mall.

02:39.709 --> 02:41.208
You're not gonna
let this go, are
you?

02:41.291 --> 02:44.667
Lil, explain to Nick when
you're a guest in someone's
home

02:44.750 --> 02:46.333
you treat it like a castle.

02:46.417 --> 02:47.709
Trouble in paradise?

02:47.792 --> 02:49.333
I accidentally
put a beer down

02:49.417 --> 02:51.959
on one of King Arthur's speakers
here for which I've apologized.

02:52.041 --> 02:53.750
Multiple times.

02:53.834 --> 02:56.333
(Jeffries)
'First of all,
it's a tube amp not a
speaker.'

02:56.417 --> 02:59.250
And you not only used it
as a coaster, you moved it.

02:59.333 --> 03:00.542
Maybe two inches.

03:00.625 --> 03:02.542
Yeah, sent the
acoustics straight to hell

03:02.625 --> 03:04.750
and
my Benny Carter vinyl.

03:04.834 --> 03:07.709
Two words for
you guys, couples counseling.

03:14.083 --> 03:16.500
I'm Detective Rush.
Can I help you?

03:16.583 --> 03:18.542
My son Jeff,
I don't know where he
is.

03:18.625 --> 03:20.959
He left for school
yesterday.
He never came back.

03:21.041 --> 03:22.458
He's not
answering his cell
phone.

03:22.542 --> 03:24.000
I'm sorry, ma'am.
This is Homicide.

03:24.083 --> 03:25.917
I brought his computer 'cause..

03:26.000 --> 03:27.750
We're not Missing Persons.

03:27.834 --> 03:29.834
Can walk you over
there if you'd like.

03:29.917 --> 03:33.667
They told me downstairs that you
deal with old murders, and, um..

03:35.500 --> 03:37.083
I found this
in my son's room.

03:37.166 --> 03:39.166
And I don't
know how long he's had it.

03:42.041 --> 03:44.834
"Body of six foot,
Caucasian male, brown hair

03:44.917 --> 03:46.917
"believed to be
in his early 40s

03:47.000 --> 03:50.917
"found in the
Schuylkill, September 24,
2008.

03:51.000 --> 03:53.458
Victim wearing jeans
and a gray T-shirt."

03:53.542 --> 03:54.959
It was an REM
concert T-shirt.

03:55.041 --> 03:56.667
This is..
This has to be
Ben.

03:56.750 --> 03:58.583
This is about
my husband, Ben Feldman.

03:58.667 --> 04:01.792
You're saying your son's
missing
and your husband was murdered?

04:01.875 --> 04:04.000
I sound like a
lunatic.
I'm not.

04:04.083 --> 04:06.083
Where did you think your
husband
was all this time?

04:06.166 --> 04:08.458
We didn't know, we
just..
We just kept hoping

04:08.542 --> 04:09.625
that he would come
walking through the
door.

04:09.709 --> 04:10.792
Who would've
wanted to kill him?

04:10.875 --> 04:12.667
My husband
was an
accountant.

04:12.750 --> 04:15.375
He was about to testify
against
someone in organized crime.

04:15.458 --> 04:16.750
Organized crime?

04:16.834 --> 04:18.834
- Someone in Philly?
- No, Providence.

04:18.917 --> 04:20.166
Freddie Ghiacconi.

04:23.417 --> 04:26.208
You saying you're in
WITSEC? Witness Protection?

04:26.291 --> 04:27.583
That's why we moved to Philly.

04:27.667 --> 04:29.709
You contact WITSEC when
your husband went missing?

04:29.792 --> 04:32.625
No, I don't
trust them
anymore.

04:32.709 --> 04:34.250
Please.

04:34.333 --> 04:35.875
Detective, I
already lost my
husband.

04:35.959 --> 04:37.417
I don't want
to lose my son,
too.

05:12.792 --> 05:14.417
(Valens)
'The body was found
in the Schuylkill'

05:14.500 --> 05:16.291
on September 24, 2008.

05:16.375 --> 05:19.166
MEs estimate it'd been
in the water two to three
days.

05:19.250 --> 05:20.709
Tracks with
what Leigh said.

05:20.792 --> 05:22.709
Ben disappeared
in September 21.

05:24.667 --> 05:27.041
Concert T-shirt.

05:27.125 --> 05:29.125
"Automatic For The People."

05:29.208 --> 05:30.375
(Valens)
'Vintage R.E.M.'

05:30.458 --> 05:32.041
It was a .380
to the back of the head.

05:32.125 --> 05:33.792
Ain't how you expect
an accountant to go down.

05:33.875 --> 05:36.458
Well, Ben took on a client
who ended up being connected.

05:36.542 --> 05:37.917
Next thing you know,
he's doing the books

05:38.000 --> 05:40.041
for Freddie
The Ice Man Ghiacconi.

05:40.125 --> 05:41.125
(Rush)
'Once you're in..'

05:41.208 --> 05:42.542
There's only one way out.

05:42.625 --> 05:43.959
We've gotta
talk to this Ghiacconi.

05:44.041 --> 05:45.750
I know where to find him,
his trial's been going on

05:45.834 --> 05:47.500
for the last
four months up in Providence.

05:47.583 --> 05:49.583
Oh, probably got
an army of
lawyers.

05:49.667 --> 05:52.625
Hey, what did Leigh tell
you about Ben's last
moves?

05:52.709 --> 05:54.500
Well, they were in
Cape May on the 21st.

05:54.583 --> 05:57.000
Ben went to Philly that night
to get money out of a locker

05:57.083 --> 05:58.834
at 30th Street Station.

05:58.917 --> 06:00.125
Guy afraid of banks?

06:00.208 --> 06:01.583
I wanna check
security tapes.

06:01.667 --> 06:03.250
Well, he
would've
had to drive.

06:03.333 --> 06:05.375
Probably take the Garden State

06:05.458 --> 06:07.083
'to the
Ben Franklin or Walt
Whitman.'

06:07.166 --> 06:08.583
Those cameras at the
bridges should be able

06:08.667 --> 06:10.792
to get a timed photo
of Ben coming through.

06:10.875 --> 06:14.125
Yeah, I'll check impounds,
see if his car turned up.

06:14.208 --> 06:15.750
Just got back from the morgue.

06:15.834 --> 06:18.458
Keep John Does on ice
for a year and get this

06:18.542 --> 06:20.792
Ben's body was ID'd yesterday.

06:20.875 --> 06:22.750
- By who?
- His son, Jeff.

06:22.834 --> 06:24.166
He's in Philly.

06:24.250 --> 06:25.375
And he's alive.

06:25.458 --> 06:27.208
At least he was
at 4 o'clock yesterday.

06:27.291 --> 06:28.959
(Miller)
'Morgue attendant said
the first thing he asked'

06:29.041 --> 06:32.333
about a body found in the river
was what kind of gun was used?

06:32.417 --> 06:34.667
Already knew
it was a gunshot
wound.

06:34.750 --> 06:37.792
We got to find that kid,
see what else he knows.

06:44.709 --> 06:46.959
Hey, you Curtis Bell?

06:47.041 --> 06:48.667
Yup. Who are you?

06:48.750 --> 06:50.834
I'm Detective Rush.
You've been ducking me--

06:50.917 --> 06:52.417
He look church-ready to you?

06:55.291 --> 06:57.083
Squeaky clean.

06:57.166 --> 07:01.291
Shot his grandma for her
social security check last
year.

07:01.375 --> 07:04.208
Now he's my eyewitness
in a drive-by.

07:04.291 --> 07:05.917
(Bell)
'So, uh, what'd
you call about?'

07:06.000 --> 07:07.625
Second or third time?

07:07.709 --> 07:09.583
Yeah, I
don't really do voice
mail.

07:11.208 --> 07:12.667
I need your
approval for a warrant

07:12.750 --> 07:15.542
for a missing kid's
cell phone, GPS or any data.

07:15.625 --> 07:19.500
GPS, they have that kind
of
thing on cell phones now?

07:19.583 --> 07:22.375
[chuckles]
Yeah, they do.

07:31.458 --> 07:33.166
Scotty, Agent Tom Parker.

07:33.250 --> 07:34.333
'Hey.'

07:35.583 --> 07:37.750
Have a seat.

07:37.834 --> 07:39.792
So what's this about?

07:41.000 --> 07:43.041
A witness of yours, Ben Feldman.

07:43.125 --> 07:44.375
Accountant who
was supposed to testify

07:44.458 --> 07:45.709
against Freddie Ghiacconi.

07:45.792 --> 07:47.041
'Yeah, washed up in the
Schuylkill'

07:47.125 --> 07:49.917
in September, gunshot.

07:50.000 --> 07:52.041
Oh, wow.

07:52.125 --> 07:53.792
Huh.

07:56.875 --> 07:59.667
(Valens)
'Guy goes missing,
you bother to investigate?'

08:01.458 --> 08:02.709
Well, the trail went cold.

08:02.792 --> 08:04.959
I-I have more
witnesses than I can handle.

08:05.041 --> 08:07.875
And then we'd already
videotaped his testimony.

08:08.959 --> 08:10.542
You think
Ghiacconi had him killed?

08:10.625 --> 08:12.792
Well, it'd
certainly lighten his load.

08:12.875 --> 08:14.750
Ghiacconi's been
in the ACI since June.

08:14.834 --> 08:18.792
Trial started November 1st,
and it's still going on.

08:18.875 --> 08:21.375
Ben was your witness
and killed on your
watch.

08:21.458 --> 08:22.792
How's that happen?

08:24.875 --> 08:26.417
Witnesses are unpredictable.

08:26.500 --> 08:27.583
You should know that.

08:27.667 --> 08:29.750
Don't always
play by the rules.

08:29.834 --> 08:31.458
Something going
on with the
family?

08:31.542 --> 08:33.041
The usual chaos.

08:33.125 --> 08:35.458
People enter WITSEC,
they have to leave old
friends

08:35.542 --> 08:38.000
old lives behind forever.

08:38.083 --> 08:43.125
Listen. I can only set people
up. I can't make 'em stay.

08:45.500 --> 08:47.166
Where were you born, Jeff?

08:47.250 --> 08:48.458
Ames, Iowa.

08:49.792 --> 08:51.709
What brought you to
Philadelphia, Leigh?

08:51.792 --> 08:54.375
My husband had an opportunity
in online accounting.

08:54.458 --> 08:56.417
Can I at least call my mother?

08:56.500 --> 08:58.000
Do you know what
she must be going through?

08:58.083 --> 08:59.250
We disappeared into thin air.

08:59.333 --> 09:01.709
It's safer for her.
For all of us.

09:01.792 --> 09:03.917
If no one knows
where we are, Leigh.

09:04.000 --> 09:05.709
You'll do anything to
avoid my mother, won't you?

09:05.792 --> 09:07.959
(Leigh)
'And what about
Jeff's education?'

09:08.041 --> 09:10.375
How is he gonna get into
Cornell with two last names?

09:10.458 --> 09:12.083
(Leigh)
'Two transcripts?'

09:12.166 --> 09:13.291
Starting tomorrow,
he'll be attending

09:13.375 --> 09:15.333
St. Xavier High School.

09:15.417 --> 09:17.125
Um, we're Jewish.

09:17.208 --> 09:18.625
Not in
Philadelphia you're not.

09:18.709 --> 09:20.625
You're not a
sprinter anymore, either.

09:20.709 --> 09:22.291
You're too fast,
it'll raise questions.

09:22.375 --> 09:24.542
What?
Dad!

09:24.625 --> 09:27.208
Is that really necessary?
Jeff's not the witness. I
am.

09:27.291 --> 09:29.667
The whole family's vulnerable.

09:29.750 --> 09:31.125
I'm trying
to keep you alive here.

09:31.208 --> 09:32.625
Right.

09:35.208 --> 09:36.959
Cross country ain't so bad.
The great outdoors, right?'

09:37.041 --> 09:39.125
And now that we're Catholic,
I can have that Christmas tree

09:39.208 --> 09:41.208
I always wanted.

09:48.375 --> 09:50.625
Don't worry, Leigh.
Jeff will get used
to it.

09:54.583 --> 09:55.542
What if he doesn't?

10:01.333 --> 10:03.667
They were good people.

10:03.750 --> 10:06.291
They're different from the
criminals I usually protect.

10:06.375 --> 10:08.208
Sounds like you
got close to them.

10:08.291 --> 10:10.750
You said the whole
family's vulnerable.

10:11.959 --> 10:13.667
Jeff got
something on Ghiacconi?

10:13.750 --> 10:15.583
Leigh said Jeff used
to help his father

10:15.667 --> 10:17.500
in the office on weekends,
might have seen something.

10:17.583 --> 10:19.291
What does
Jeff have to do with this?

10:20.834 --> 10:22.875
He went missing yesterday.

10:25.750 --> 10:28.208
Where's Leigh?

10:31.709 --> 10:33.208
Tom?

10:33.291 --> 10:34.417
Leigh.

10:35.542 --> 10:37.208
I'm sorry about Ben.

10:37.291 --> 10:38.625
Yeah.

10:39.667 --> 10:41.375
They told me Jeff's missing.

10:41.458 --> 10:43.291
(Parker)
'You know,
you could've called.'

10:44.417 --> 10:46.291
It's not your fault.

10:46.375 --> 10:50.375
If there's anything I can
do, you know how to reach me.

10:57.875 --> 11:00.083
Did you hear
anything about Jeff
yet?

11:00.166 --> 11:01.709
A technician's
looking at his
computer.

11:01.792 --> 11:04.750
We're tracking
the GPS on his cell
phone.

11:04.834 --> 11:07.458
[sighs]
Still nothing.

11:07.542 --> 11:09.625
He stay in touch
with
any of his old
friends?

11:09.709 --> 11:12.542
Anyone you can think of
he might have gone to
see?

11:12.625 --> 11:13.792
I've been wracking my brain.

11:13.875 --> 11:17.000
There's...no one
for him to go to.

11:17.083 --> 11:19.917
No family, friends?

11:20.000 --> 11:23.291
After we joined WITSEC, we cut
off everyone we'd ever known.

11:23.375 --> 11:25.250
Jeff never got close
to anyone after that.

11:25.333 --> 11:27.709
It was just the two of us.

11:27.792 --> 11:29.458
What'd he think
when Ben disappeared?

11:31.250 --> 11:33.375
We both knew
Ghiacconi got to him.

11:33.458 --> 11:34.917
Neither of
us wanted to say it out loud

11:35.000 --> 11:37.750
afraid it'd...make it true,
so..

11:37.834 --> 11:40.917
He mentioned Jeff might have
met Ghiacconi at Ben's office

11:41.000 --> 11:42.333
the weekends he was there.

11:42.417 --> 11:44.875
Any other interactions
between them you know about?

11:44.959 --> 11:47.583
He ever come over to the house,
socialize with the family?

11:47.667 --> 11:50.625
No. No. I made Ben
keep business separate.

11:50.709 --> 11:53.500
He spent so much time
at the office as it was.

11:53.583 --> 11:56.375
Relocation must have
been hard on Jeff.

11:56.458 --> 11:57.792
Sounds crazy, but..

11:59.291 --> 12:01.500
...going into WITSEC
actually brought us closer.

12:02.875 --> 12:05.834
Hadn't felt
like a family in so long.

12:07.375 --> 12:08.917
Go, Jeff! Jeff!

12:11.750 --> 12:13.333
Whoo! Jeff!

12:19.083 --> 12:20.291
(Leigh)
'Come on, Jeff.'

12:20.375 --> 12:21.625
Whoo!

12:23.041 --> 12:23.959
Whoo!

12:24.041 --> 12:26.291
Alright!
Whoo!

12:29.792 --> 12:31.917
So much for
not attracting attention.

12:32.000 --> 12:34.750
Carl Lewis. Can't remember
the last time I saw him run.

12:34.834 --> 12:36.792
Wonder who
he's trying to impress.

12:36.875 --> 12:40.166
(Ben)
'Now I get it, the reason he
spent an hour this morning'

12:40.250 --> 12:42.458
primping for
an eight K through the woods.

12:42.542 --> 12:45.917
Hmm. Know your
son better than you think.

12:46.000 --> 12:47.709
He looks like himself again.

12:47.792 --> 12:49.667
Tom says kids
bounce back
faster.

12:49.750 --> 12:52.542
Yeah, yeah.
Shorter memories.

12:54.125 --> 12:56.959
Am I crazy, or do you
maybe hate me a little less?

12:57.041 --> 12:58.500
You have your moments.

12:58.583 --> 13:01.250
But don't push it, Foster.

13:01.333 --> 13:03.625
Everything I put
our family through..

13:06.417 --> 13:09.000
If ever there were a
reason for you to walk away..

13:11.667 --> 13:13.458
...it means the world
to me that you didn't.

13:21.917 --> 13:23.291
Let's go congratulate Jeff.

13:37.375 --> 13:38.709
Go find Jeff.

13:38.792 --> 13:40.250
We need to go now.

13:43.959 --> 13:47.125
Um...just when we had
a chance to be a family again

13:47.208 --> 13:49.625
we were back on the run.

13:49.709 --> 13:51.083
Who was the guy?

13:51.166 --> 13:55.208
Vinnie, um, Buonaforte.
Ghiacconi's driver.

13:55.291 --> 13:58.750
He took Ghiacconi to all his
meetings at Ben's office.

13:58.834 --> 14:00.750
- Any idea how he found you?
- No.

14:00.834 --> 14:02.625
As soon as Ben saw him,
we drove to Cape May.

14:02.709 --> 14:03.667
Why Cape May?

14:03.750 --> 14:05.792
Place where we had
our honeymoon.

14:05.875 --> 14:07.125
Ben loved the Jersey Shore.

14:07.208 --> 14:10.041
We'd walk for
hours on the beach.

14:10.125 --> 14:13.750
That the same night Ben came
back to Philly for the money?

14:13.834 --> 14:16.750
I figured if he went late
at night, he'd be safe.

14:18.667 --> 14:21.250
That was the
last time I saw him.

14:24.542 --> 14:26.333
(Bell)
'Oh, detectives.'

14:26.417 --> 14:29.083
US Attorney in Rhode Island got
me up to speed on Vinnie Brown.

14:29.166 --> 14:30.709
You mean Buonaforte.

14:30.792 --> 14:31.917
Brown, Buonaforte.

14:32.000 --> 14:33.750
Tomato, tom-ah-to.

14:33.834 --> 14:34.917
This says Brown.

14:35.000 --> 14:36.208
Oh, oh.

14:36.291 --> 14:38.291
Sorry, I must have
grabbed the wrong
file.

14:38.375 --> 14:39.583
Huh.

14:39.667 --> 14:42.000
Address matches and
so do the
fingerprints.

14:42.083 --> 14:43.208
Uh, Vinnie Brown.

14:43.291 --> 14:45.458
Arrested for burglary
in Camden a month ago.

14:45.542 --> 14:47.291
Jacked a bunch
of flat screens.

14:47.375 --> 14:48.875
Do any time?

14:48.959 --> 14:51.792
Charges were dropped at the
insistence of the US
Attorney.

14:51.875 --> 14:53.625
That normal,
US Attorney getting involved

14:53.709 --> 14:55.041
in a small time burglary?

14:55.125 --> 14:56.959
Happens every...uh, never.

14:57.041 --> 14:59.500
Oh, federal
interference, a name change.

14:59.583 --> 15:02.208
Sounds like Ben wasn't the
only one in Witness
Protection.

15:02.291 --> 15:04.458
Bingo. But
here's the ass-kicker.

15:04.542 --> 15:08.208
Feds snapped this guy's
picture
in Providence, August '08.

15:08.291 --> 15:10.917
That's five months after
he was relocated to Philly.

15:11.000 --> 15:11.959
Check it.

15:12.041 --> 15:12.959
We had the Ice Man.

15:13.041 --> 15:15.375
Now we got the Dice Man.

15:15.458 --> 15:18.500
So this Vinnie Buonaforte's
is in WITSEC with the feds

15:18.583 --> 15:19.834
but working
for Ghiacconi in Providence?

15:19.917 --> 15:21.333
Playing both sides.

15:21.417 --> 15:24.333
Maybe he tries to earn a few
stripes with Ghiacconi.

15:24.417 --> 15:28.000
Ah, takes out the feds'
star witness against him.

15:34.458 --> 15:35.667
Sure you don't want me
to brew up some chamomile?

15:35.750 --> 15:37.291
Got a cupboard
full of the stuff.

15:37.375 --> 15:41.041
My daughter's tryin' to
knock my cholesterol down.

15:42.834 --> 15:44.500
(Rush)
'When are you scheduled
to testify against'

15:44.583 --> 15:46.000
Freddie Ghiacconi, Vinnie?

15:46.083 --> 15:47.917
Just waitin' for the call.

15:48.000 --> 15:49.500
Thought you
two were here to prep me.

15:49.583 --> 15:52.000
Still keep ties with
your old pals in Providence?

15:52.083 --> 15:55.166
You kidding? They want my head
on their living room wall.

15:55.250 --> 15:56.917
So how'd the feds
get this pretty
picture

15:57.000 --> 15:58.709
of your mug in August?

16:03.041 --> 16:04.542
Missed my old bakery.

16:04.625 --> 16:07.542
People down here, they don't
know a cannoli from a
cruller.

16:07.625 --> 16:10.208
We're supposed to believe you'd
risk your life for a pastry?

16:10.291 --> 16:11.792
It's true.

16:13.166 --> 16:15.917
WITSEC gave me
a second chance. I took it.

16:16.000 --> 16:17.834
I'm a suburban dad now.

16:17.917 --> 16:20.583
I-I punch a clock
at a paper company.

16:20.667 --> 16:23.208
I-I play video games
with my daughter.

16:23.291 --> 16:24.667
I-I drive a friggin' minivan.

16:24.750 --> 16:27.542
Tell us about the last time
you saw Ben Feldman

16:27.625 --> 16:29.458
the Ice Man's accountant.

16:29.542 --> 16:31.709
Ben Feldman.
This is about that?

16:31.792 --> 16:35.041
Answer the
question, Mr. Cannoli.

16:35.125 --> 16:37.250
I saw Ben.

16:37.333 --> 16:42.375
Had to be...over a year ago
back when I was driving
Freddie.

16:43.500 --> 16:44.959
Ben was good people.

16:45.041 --> 16:48.250
He always offered me coffee...
every time I brought Freddie
by.

16:48.333 --> 16:51.792
Uh, and in a mug, too.
Wasn't some styrofoam
situation.

16:51.875 --> 16:53.083
We know you tracked Ben down

16:53.166 --> 16:54.917
at a cross country
meet in September.

16:55.000 --> 16:57.125
- Why you lyin' to us,
Vinnie?
- Right, right.

16:57.208 --> 16:58.542
I-I forgot about that.

16:58.625 --> 17:00.959
Selective memory
will get you hauled downtown.

17:01.041 --> 17:04.750
I was there
watching my daughter run.

17:04.834 --> 17:07.041
Her school was racing
against Ben's kid's.

17:07.125 --> 17:08.500
Ah, that's some coincidence.

17:08.583 --> 17:10.166
Right, right.

17:10.250 --> 17:13.000
I admit, uh, it threw
me when I ran into him.

17:13.083 --> 17:15.417
Been forever since
I seen a familiar face.

17:19.000 --> 17:21.500
(Vinnie)
'Hey, Ben, nice
to see you again.'

17:21.583 --> 17:23.709
You run 'cause
of little old me?

17:26.166 --> 17:29.125
[laughs]
If you could see
the look on your face.

17:30.667 --> 17:32.917
When I saw you at the race,
I thought

17:33.000 --> 17:37.125
"Crap, he's gonna call
Freddie.
Tell him where I am."

17:37.208 --> 17:41.125
Then I realized,
you're his friggin'
accountant.

17:41.208 --> 17:43.792
Probably in WITSEC, too.

17:43.875 --> 17:45.000
Since February.

17:45.083 --> 17:46.000
March for me.

17:46.083 --> 17:48.333
I'm Vinnie Brown now.

17:48.417 --> 17:51.750
My nonna must
be rolling in her
grave.

17:54.875 --> 17:57.458
- What's this?
- Zeppole from Scialo's.

17:57.542 --> 18:00.667
I sneak back every few weeks,
get a fix.

18:00.750 --> 18:01.959
You live in Philly?

18:02.041 --> 18:03.458
Camden.

18:03.542 --> 18:05.709
Wife hit the
bricks when I
flipped.

18:05.792 --> 18:07.792
It's just me
and my daughter Tammy.

18:09.750 --> 18:11.000
She was racin' this morning.

18:11.083 --> 18:12.250
That's why you were at the meet?

18:12.333 --> 18:13.417
You scared the hell out of me.

18:13.500 --> 18:14.917
What, you follow us home?

18:15.000 --> 18:17.917
Eh, figured you wouldn't
notice
me in my beautiful minivan.

18:18.000 --> 18:19.375
Where's the wife and kid?

18:19.458 --> 18:21.667
Waiting in the car.

18:21.750 --> 18:23.583
Six months ago,
I'm a big
spacone.

18:23.667 --> 18:26.333
Freddie and I had
box seats to all the games

18:26.417 --> 18:28.000
ate at Capreech's
every night.

18:28.083 --> 18:29.792
'Now I'm waiting
in line at Costco.'

18:29.875 --> 18:31.333
It's weird, huh?

18:31.417 --> 18:35.375
Pretending your whole life
don't exist before a year
ago.

18:35.458 --> 18:37.041
It isn't all bad.

18:37.125 --> 18:38.208
I see my family more.

18:38.291 --> 18:41.458
Yeah, yeah.

18:41.542 --> 18:44.000
I could never have got through
this without my daughter Tammy.

18:44.083 --> 18:45.709
She's a hell of a kid.

18:47.458 --> 18:49.083
Makes a
chicken piccata to die
for.

18:50.792 --> 18:53.959
Biggest gripe's with my
marshal
guy practically babysits us.

18:54.041 --> 18:56.166
Yeah? I never see my guy.

18:56.250 --> 18:59.792
He even built shelves
for my wife's cookbooks.

18:59.875 --> 19:01.458
Well, that ain't right.

19:01.542 --> 19:04.959
There's only room for one set
of power tools in the house.

19:07.458 --> 19:08.959
I'm just saying
I wouldn't want

19:09.041 --> 19:11.083
some other guy
in my wife's kitchen.

19:11.166 --> 19:13.792
- Where were you that night?
- Had to be home.

19:13.875 --> 19:16.959
Watching "High School Musical"
with Tammy.

19:17.041 --> 19:19.625
Did after every race.
A ritual type thing.

19:21.625 --> 19:23.792
There she is.

19:23.875 --> 19:25.208
Hi, daddy.

19:25.291 --> 19:26.583
My daughter Tammy.

19:26.667 --> 19:28.291
(Vinnie)
'Straight As
at Villanova.'

19:28.375 --> 19:31.208
Talk about the apple
falling far from the tree.

19:31.291 --> 19:34.083
Cool it on
the zeppole runs,
Vinnie.

19:34.166 --> 19:35.625
Bad for your health.

19:37.500 --> 19:39.458
(Vinnie)
'How's school?
You get the test back?'

19:39.542 --> 19:40.709
(Tammy)
'Got an A.'

19:45.834 --> 19:50.083
Found articles on the Ghiacconi
trial on Jeff Foster's computer.

19:50.166 --> 19:52.250
Kid was checking
every day for updates.

19:52.333 --> 19:54.041
Oh, anything
on his e-mail accounts?

19:54.125 --> 19:56.375
Uh, just got around
his password a few minutes ago.

19:56.458 --> 19:57.583
Any luck
with the GPS?

19:57.667 --> 19:59.208
Uh, no, nothing yet.

19:59.291 --> 20:00.959
Looking for
the only teenager in America

20:01.041 --> 20:02.583
not addicted
to his cell phone.

20:05.083 --> 20:09.709
Hey, uh, I got tickets
to the Sixers game tonight.

20:09.792 --> 20:11.750
Uh, I-I can't. Sorry.

20:12.917 --> 20:14.500
Hot date or..

20:16.500 --> 20:17.709
Look, Scotty..

20:19.417 --> 20:20.875
...Billy and I..

20:20.959 --> 20:22.083
Yeah?

20:24.041 --> 20:26.750
We're gonna
give it another
shot.

20:26.834 --> 20:28.583
Another shot, hmm?

20:28.667 --> 20:31.500
- Just like that?
- Family's been all over us.

20:31.583 --> 20:34.125
[chuckles]
They even brought
in
the priests.

20:35.375 --> 20:36.792
I've been married six years.

20:36.875 --> 20:39.792
I never put
in any effort, you
know?

20:39.875 --> 20:41.750
Walk away now, you never
know what could've been.

20:41.834 --> 20:46.083
Yeah, no. Hey...do what
you got to do, right?

20:47.375 --> 20:48.625
So we're cool?

20:50.125 --> 20:52.166
Yeah.
We're cool.

20:57.083 --> 20:59.667
Feds make a habit of putting
witnesses who know each other

20:59.750 --> 21:02.041
in the same place, Tom?

21:02.125 --> 21:04.542
Vinnie was in Camden.
Ben was in Philly.

21:04.625 --> 21:06.083
We needed them
close for the
trial.

21:06.166 --> 21:08.000
Hmm. Close enough
where their kids

21:08.083 --> 21:10.834
run in the same
cross country league?

21:10.917 --> 21:12.583
Do witnesses sometimes
run into each other?

21:12.667 --> 21:13.834
Sure.

21:13.917 --> 21:16.583
It's happened
before.
It'll happen again.

21:16.667 --> 21:17.709
Tom.

21:17.792 --> 21:19.625
Noticed Leigh called you that.

21:19.709 --> 21:21.834
(Rush)
'All of your witnesses
call you by your first name?'

21:21.917 --> 21:24.458
- Some.
- Much of a handyman, Tom?

21:26.917 --> 21:29.792
- Uh, no, not really.
- 'Hmm.'

21:29.875 --> 21:32.500
Heard you build
a mean cookbook shelf.

21:32.583 --> 21:35.709
(Rush)
'Kept an eye on Ben's family,
always checking in, uh..'

21:36.917 --> 21:39.208
They were good
people, right?

21:39.291 --> 21:41.041
That's what I said.

21:41.125 --> 21:42.583
Are you and Leigh close?

21:44.834 --> 21:47.250
She was having
a hard time adjusting.

21:47.333 --> 21:48.917
I was a shoulder to cry on.

21:49.000 --> 21:50.917
Give her more
than your
shoulder?

21:52.417 --> 21:53.542
I'm not gonna answer that.

21:53.625 --> 21:56.041
Not very good at
your job, are you, Tom?

21:56.125 --> 21:58.000
Some issues with boundaries?

21:58.083 --> 22:00.834
Where were you the night
Ben disappeared, Tom?

22:00.917 --> 22:04.083
I was on a plane
transporting a witness to
Ohio.

22:06.041 --> 22:07.625
What I don't understand

22:07.709 --> 22:10.542
if Ben was a key
witness in Ghiacconi's trial

22:10.625 --> 22:12.333
why did you let
him leave WITSEC?

22:13.875 --> 22:16.959
I didn't have much choice.

22:23.041 --> 22:25.250
Got here as fast as I could.
What's going on?

22:25.333 --> 22:28.083
I just saw Vinnie Buonaforte
at Jeff's cross country meet.

22:28.166 --> 22:29.250
I practically
had a heart attack.

22:29.333 --> 22:30.542
Vinnie's a witness, too.

22:30.625 --> 22:32.792
You said you would
protect my family.

22:32.875 --> 22:34.542
- And I will.
- Who're we gonna run into
next?

22:34.625 --> 22:37.625
Huh? Ghiacconi's
internist? His tailor?

22:40.083 --> 22:41.750
Ugh. I am done. I'm out.

22:41.834 --> 22:43.417
I'm gonna take care
of my family myself.

22:43.500 --> 22:46.917
Ben, come on. You're in no
position to go out on your
own.

22:47.000 --> 22:48.667
You need me to sign some
paperwork, I'll do it.

22:48.750 --> 22:49.625
But then I'm gone.

22:49.709 --> 22:51.583
Walk away and we'll prosecute.

22:51.667 --> 22:53.333
Try to stop me
and I'll tell your bosses

22:53.417 --> 22:56.250
you slept with my wife.

23:01.417 --> 23:03.166
Yeah, I thought
you'd say that.

23:03.250 --> 23:05.333
You stay the hell
away from my family.

23:14.166 --> 23:17.250
It was the
worst mistake of my
life.

23:17.333 --> 23:18.959
Bosses ever find out
about you and Leigh?

23:19.041 --> 23:21.000
No.

23:21.083 --> 23:22.291
I'd like to keep it that way.

23:22.375 --> 23:25.291
Then you better
start playing ball.

23:25.375 --> 23:27.125
What else haven't you told us?

23:29.166 --> 23:30.583
Before they left WITSEC..

23:32.208 --> 23:34.291
...Leigh asked me how
to go about buyin' a
gun.

23:37.083 --> 23:38.333
(Stillman)
'Where'd you send her?'

23:38.417 --> 23:40.500
Sent her to a
gun shop in Quakertown.

23:40.583 --> 23:43.041
(Parker)
'She and Jeff fell off
the grid after Ben
disappeared.'

23:43.125 --> 23:45.333
And after I found out that
she opened a bank account

23:45.417 --> 23:46.625
in Maryland,
I stopped
looking.

23:46.709 --> 23:48.250
You think she
might have killed
Ben?

23:48.333 --> 23:52.500
I don't know, but he took her
life away from her once.

23:52.583 --> 23:55.917
She wasn't gonna
let him take it again.

24:01.041 --> 24:02.792
Crank call?

24:02.875 --> 24:05.709
I'm trying to schedule a
sit-down with Freddie
Ghiacconi

24:05.792 --> 24:08.667
and his lawyers keep passing
me around like a hot potato.

24:08.750 --> 24:10.208
What is it with you people?

24:10.291 --> 24:12.583
Well, law school
teaches you three
things.

24:12.667 --> 24:16.709
Delay, deflect,
derail and deny.

24:16.792 --> 24:18.166
That's four.

24:20.000 --> 24:22.709
Your boy Jeff sent a text at
11:00 this morning from
Philly.

24:22.792 --> 24:25.041
- "On my way," it said.
- Who'd it go to?

24:25.125 --> 24:26.917
'Recipient's got a
different carrier.'

24:27.000 --> 24:28.875
Waiting to hear back.

24:28.959 --> 24:30.417
(Miller)
'That's good info.'

24:30.500 --> 24:32.959
- Where did you get it?
- I know a guy knows a guy.

24:33.041 --> 24:34.250
(Bell)
'Tech's gonna
call you personally'

24:34.333 --> 24:35.709
the minute that
cell goes live.

24:35.792 --> 24:37.542
Uh...help yourself.

24:37.625 --> 24:39.917
Got a thing for
the Ultra Fine Flairs.

24:40.000 --> 24:41.875
Talked to the gun registry.

24:41.959 --> 24:45.375
Leigh bought a .380
a month before Ben disappeared.

24:45.458 --> 24:46.959
Same caliber
that killed him.

24:48.375 --> 24:50.375
Feds didn't make Ben
pay for leaving
WITSEC.

24:50.458 --> 24:51.834
Yeah. Maybe Leigh did.

24:57.291 --> 24:59.000
Own a gun, Leigh?

24:59.083 --> 25:00.625
What would I need a gun for?

25:00.709 --> 25:02.000
We're wondering
the same thing.

25:04.125 --> 25:05.834
No.

25:05.917 --> 25:08.083
Receipt from
Yankee Arms in Quakertown

25:08.166 --> 25:10.417
dated August 20th, 2008.

25:10.500 --> 25:13.166
Want to read the
signature for me?

25:13.250 --> 25:16.166
I was scared.
We needed protection.

25:16.250 --> 25:17.875
You came to us
for help,
Leigh.

25:17.959 --> 25:20.750
We're trying to find your
son.
Don't need you holding
back.

25:20.834 --> 25:22.000
Jeff ran away.

25:22.083 --> 25:23.583
- That 'cause of you?
- Of course not.

25:23.667 --> 25:26.709
Maybe he found out
about you and Parker?

25:26.792 --> 25:29.125
Or should I call him Tom?

25:31.709 --> 25:33.959
That was a mistake.

25:34.041 --> 25:36.375
Ben and I were gonna
put that behind us, try
again.

25:36.458 --> 25:40.792
You lied about the gun,
forgot
to tell us about Parker.

25:40.875 --> 25:42.792
What other surprises
you got for us, Leigh?

25:42.875 --> 25:47.875
I know it looks bad
but after all we'd been
through

25:47.959 --> 25:50.834
I still loved my husband.

25:59.041 --> 26:01.625
I found this in your bag.

26:01.709 --> 26:03.166
'Did Parker
give this to you?'

26:03.250 --> 26:05.709
No. I bought it myself.

26:05.792 --> 26:06.959
Without telling me?

26:07.041 --> 26:09.625
I panicked,
thought
we might need it.

26:09.709 --> 26:11.375
'I'm going to take care
of our family, Leigh.'

26:11.458 --> 26:12.834
Not with guns.

26:12.917 --> 26:14.583
And after
today,
I believe you.

26:19.458 --> 26:20.625
I know about you and Tom.

26:27.750 --> 26:28.917
- Is it over?
- Yes.

26:35.041 --> 26:39.041
We can get through this.
Clean slate.

26:39.125 --> 26:41.125
If you still want to.

26:43.875 --> 26:45.375
I'm sorry.

26:49.625 --> 26:51.000
Me, too.

26:55.583 --> 26:57.792
I'm going to go to Philly
tonight and get the money.

26:57.875 --> 26:59.458
If you don't hear
from me by tomorrow
night

26:59.542 --> 27:01.500
you and Jeff go to
Snow Hill, Maryland

27:01.583 --> 27:05.375
for six months, then..

27:05.458 --> 27:08.208
Come on,
Leigh. Then what?

27:08.291 --> 27:11.375
Then...Durham, North Carolina.

27:11.458 --> 27:13.291
Stay there five months.

27:13.375 --> 27:16.041
Then Austin, Texas.

27:16.125 --> 27:17.291
The accounts
are all set
up.

27:17.375 --> 27:19.041
You'll have
everything you need.

27:31.792 --> 27:34.875
I didn't hear from him,
so I followed the plan.

27:34.959 --> 27:36.208
Where's the gun now?

27:36.291 --> 27:38.083
In our apartment
in Snow Hill.

27:38.166 --> 27:40.917
It's been there...five months.

27:42.166 --> 27:43.625
When's the last
time
you saw it?

27:43.709 --> 27:46.208
It's locked up. Why?

27:46.291 --> 27:49.291
Jeff ID'd Ben's body, Leigh.

27:49.375 --> 27:51.250
He's been tracking
Ghiacconi's trial.

27:52.750 --> 27:55.417
Oh, no.
No, that's not possible.

27:55.500 --> 27:58.125
Jeff's..
He's not a violent kid.

28:00.667 --> 28:02.750
He ever mention
going to
Providence?

28:07.500 --> 28:10.000
(Jeffries)
Snow Hill PD
searched Leigh's apartment.

28:10.083 --> 28:11.583
Couldn't find the gun.

28:11.667 --> 28:13.291
You think Jeff might
be taking it to Providence?

28:13.375 --> 28:14.959
I put out a broadcast
to all the departments

28:15.041 --> 28:16.417
between here and Rhode Island.

28:16.500 --> 28:18.291
Well, call Providence PD.
Tell them they're gonna
need

28:18.375 --> 28:19.959
extra uniforms
at the
courthouse.

28:20.041 --> 28:21.208
Alright.

28:22.875 --> 28:25.583
I hit a dead end on the photos
of the bridges, lieutenant.

28:25.667 --> 28:27.709
(Rafferty)
'No sign of Ben's car
coming into Philly.'

28:27.792 --> 28:29.125
What route did you check?

28:29.208 --> 28:32.166
Garden State to the Walt
Whitman
and the Ben Franklin.

28:32.250 --> 28:33.917
Ben was lying low.

28:34.000 --> 28:37.417
Might've taken the 73
to 130, come in the back
roads.

28:37.500 --> 28:39.500
Try the Tacony-Palmyra Bridge.

28:39.583 --> 28:42.959
I, uh, just got word
from the phone company.

28:43.041 --> 28:45.458
Number Jeff texted
belongs to Tammy Brown.

28:45.542 --> 28:47.959
- Vinnie Brown's daughter?
- 'One and only.'

28:48.041 --> 28:50.417
'Must have been seeing
each other all this time.'

28:50.500 --> 28:52.625
Hiding it from
their families.

28:52.709 --> 28:54.625
Alright, get Tammy
in here and grab a car.

28:54.709 --> 28:56.208
You and Will
are going to Providence.

29:01.041 --> 29:02.583
When'd you last see
Jeff Foster, Tammy?

29:02.667 --> 29:05.959
[sighs]
Guess it was
around September.

29:06.041 --> 29:08.166
At a cross country meet.

29:08.250 --> 29:09.750
You guys hang out much?

29:09.834 --> 29:11.792
No. I barely know him.

29:11.875 --> 29:15.542
'That's too bad. 'Cause you
guys
got a lot in common.'

29:17.667 --> 29:20.125
You both listen to Arcade Fire

29:20.208 --> 29:21.959
both want to save
the rain forest.

29:22.041 --> 29:23.417
Both got daddies in WITSEC.

29:23.500 --> 29:26.500
We know he texted you
today, Tammy. Where is he?

29:31.583 --> 29:33.834
Think you're protecting
him by keeping quiet?

29:33.917 --> 29:36.667
I have a constitutional
right to remain silent.

29:36.750 --> 29:38.917
(Vera)
'Constitution also says that
if you know someone's gonna'

29:39.000 --> 29:41.834
commit a crime,
makes you a co-conspirator.

29:41.917 --> 29:43.583
(Miller)
'Looking at life in prison'

29:43.667 --> 29:46.709
even if you're not
the one who pulls the
trigger.

29:48.000 --> 29:50.375
[bangs table]
Where is he, Tammy?

29:50.458 --> 29:51.625
I don't know.

29:53.417 --> 29:55.375
He pulls a gun..

29:55.458 --> 29:57.625
...the cops at the courthouse
will shoot him dead.

29:57.709 --> 29:59.709
Ask questions later.

29:59.792 --> 30:02.709
(Miller)
'Looks like you're never
gonna see that rain forest.'

30:02.792 --> 30:04.000
Much less save it.

30:04.959 --> 30:06.625
Break your daddy's heart.

30:09.792 --> 30:10.917
Wait.

30:13.709 --> 30:14.959
I saw him last night.

30:16.375 --> 30:18.166
We met at
a friend's dorm room.

30:23.333 --> 30:25.917
I can't believe
you're really here.

30:26.000 --> 30:29.250
- I'm really here.
- I missed you so much.

30:32.125 --> 30:35.750
I sit in class and dream of
all the places we talked
about.

30:35.834 --> 30:38.792
Walking on
the beach in Ko
Samui.

30:38.875 --> 30:40.959
Hiking in Nicaragua.

30:41.041 --> 30:42.667
Breakfast in Bali.

30:42.750 --> 30:45.458
Deciding where to go next
by spinning the globe.

30:54.875 --> 30:57.250
We're never going
anywhere, are we?

30:58.834 --> 31:00.208
Yes, we are.

31:01.083 --> 31:02.417
Promise.

31:02.500 --> 31:06.083
What, you're gonna put us
in some giant time machine

31:06.166 --> 31:07.667
rewrite history?

31:07.750 --> 31:09.834
No.

31:11.875 --> 31:13.750
I'm gonna fix things.

31:18.875 --> 31:21.291
I don't want anything
bad to happen to him.

31:22.333 --> 31:23.500
"Fix things."

31:23.583 --> 31:26.625
(Vera)
'He talking about Ghiacconi?'

31:26.709 --> 31:27.792
Yes.

31:27.875 --> 31:29.750
Where is Jeff
staying in Providence?

31:31.208 --> 31:32.500
The Pilgrim's Landing Motel.

31:46.250 --> 31:47.875
The shower's still wet.

31:47.959 --> 31:49.291
- We just missed him.
- Courthouse.

31:50.375 --> 31:52.583
Let's go.

31:57.208 --> 31:59.625
The GPS has him
in a two block radius.

32:04.375 --> 32:05.667
It's got to be Ghiacconi.

32:05.750 --> 32:08.083
Always send
the real one and a dummy.

32:20.125 --> 32:22.166
Ice, ice, baby.

32:22.250 --> 32:23.709
Bud, he's on the move, Scotty.

32:23.792 --> 32:26.208
Heading north
toward the courthouse.

32:27.333 --> 32:28.625
Send him a text.

32:34.250 --> 32:36.959
Scotty, gray hoodie
and jeans. That's him.

33:03.625 --> 33:05.041
(Jeff)
'No! What are you doing?'

33:05.125 --> 33:08.041
Keep your head down, mouth shut
and legs moving, come on.

33:17.458 --> 33:18.792
(Valens)
'Give it up, Jeff.'

33:18.875 --> 33:20.208
'You ain't going nowhere.'

33:20.291 --> 33:23.375
- Who are you?
- Philly PD.

33:23.458 --> 33:25.583
Tryin' to save your life, stop
you from doing something
stupid.

33:25.667 --> 33:27.959
My father was the star
witness against that goombah.

33:28.041 --> 33:29.834
He kills my dad,
and now he's gonna walk?

33:29.917 --> 33:31.959
Your dad videotaped
his deposition.

33:32.041 --> 33:33.417
Ghiacconi's not going anywhere.

33:33.500 --> 33:35.250
He needs to pay
for what he did!

33:35.333 --> 33:37.041
And what, you spend
the rest of your life in
jail?

33:37.125 --> 33:38.250
It'd be worth it.

33:38.333 --> 33:39.917
Son, you may
think you want revenge

33:40.000 --> 33:42.917
but trust me,
just tears you up.

33:43.834 --> 33:45.333
What do you know about it?

33:45.417 --> 33:47.208
I've been there.

33:52.875 --> 33:55.667
I just wanted
to make things right.

33:59.000 --> 34:02.709
Until Ghiacconi's behind
bars, we have to keep moving.

34:02.792 --> 34:04.542
So it could
be like this for years?

34:04.625 --> 34:06.208
I hope not,
but I don't
know.

34:08.542 --> 34:10.875
Isn't this where you're
supposed
to tell me not to worry?

34:10.959 --> 34:12.542
(Jeff)
You've got it
all worked out?

34:12.625 --> 34:14.625
You're too old
for fairy tales.

34:14.709 --> 34:16.625
I wish Ghiacconi was dead.

34:16.709 --> 34:19.125
It wouldn't
change what I
did.

34:19.208 --> 34:21.291
If I could
take it all
back.

34:21.375 --> 34:23.583
It's always your decision.

34:23.667 --> 34:24.959
Always your plan.

34:25.041 --> 34:27.208
Where I go to school,
what classes I take

34:27.291 --> 34:29.333
what sports I do.

34:29.417 --> 34:31.458
I

34:31.542 --> 34:34.083
You and your mother
are everything to
me.

34:34.166 --> 34:35.291
I mean,
I want us to stay
together

34:35.375 --> 34:37.000
get through this as a family.

34:40.375 --> 34:41.834
If you still wanna
go travel the world

34:41.917 --> 34:46.417
I'm not gonna
stand in your
way.

34:52.834 --> 34:53.917
What about mom?

34:54.000 --> 34:56.125
I'll get her on board.

34:56.208 --> 34:58.834
Give me a day or two to get
you some money and a passport.

35:01.500 --> 35:05.125
That's it?
You're letting me go?

35:05.208 --> 35:06.875
You've paid enough
for your old man's
mistakes.

35:23.333 --> 35:27.250
I was all set to spin the
globe, go wherever it landed.

35:29.125 --> 35:31.709
But I decided to stay
with my parents
instead.

35:31.792 --> 35:33.875
I never got the chance
to tell my dad my decision.

35:33.959 --> 35:35.333
Spin the globe?

35:35.417 --> 35:36.834
You saying
Tammy was there with you?

35:36.917 --> 35:38.500
She came down to the shore.

35:40.750 --> 35:43.000
Telling her
I couldn't go away with her..

35:44.792 --> 35:46.208
...it was the
hardest thing I'd ever done.

35:46.291 --> 35:47.375
You two were
gonna leave that night?

35:47.458 --> 35:49.041
She was already packed.

35:49.125 --> 35:51.542
(Jeff)
'Even wrote a letter to her
dad
to say goodbye.'

36:00.750 --> 36:02.333
Why didn't you tell us
you were down the shore

36:02.417 --> 36:04.500
the night of
the cross country meet, Tammy?

36:06.875 --> 36:10.917
I was afraid my father would
find out I was gonna run away.

36:11.000 --> 36:12.000
He'd kill me.

36:12.083 --> 36:14.083
Where'd he think
you were that night?

36:14.166 --> 36:16.250
At the library. Studying.

36:18.333 --> 36:20.250
After Jeff said
he couldn't go away with
me

36:20.333 --> 36:21.792
I checked my phone.

36:21.875 --> 36:24.750
He'd already called, like,
nine times, looking for me.

36:24.834 --> 36:25.917
What'd you tell him?

36:26.000 --> 36:27.917
That I'd be home soon.

36:28.000 --> 36:29.417
Then I drove like
a maniac back to Camden.

36:29.500 --> 36:31.792
- He there when you got home?
- No. Thank God.

36:31.875 --> 36:33.417
I just tore up
the letter I wrote
him

36:33.500 --> 36:35.583
flushed it down the toilet.

36:35.667 --> 36:37.041
He never knew
I was gonna
leave.

36:39.500 --> 36:41.583
Please don't tell him, okay?

36:49.000 --> 36:51.583
Ben's car turned up
at a salvage yard in Whitman.

36:51.667 --> 36:54.458
CSU found blood
in the trunk.

36:54.542 --> 36:56.458
(Stillman)
Parker wanted in
on the interview.

36:56.542 --> 36:58.625
Said Ben was his witness.

36:58.709 --> 37:01.500
Little late for the
professionalism there,
Tom.

37:01.583 --> 37:03.250
I'm not giving
this one up to the feds.

37:03.333 --> 37:06.125
Told him thanks, but I thought
he'd done quite enough already.

37:08.709 --> 37:11.291
Well, the feds said if you
testified against Ghiacconi

37:11.375 --> 37:14.625
they'd keep you
safe, out of prison.

37:14.709 --> 37:17.792
Didn't tell you what it
would
cost you, though, did
they?

37:17.875 --> 37:19.917
'Lost your wife,
your friends.'

37:20.000 --> 37:22.709
Not the
big spacone anymore, huh?

37:22.792 --> 37:24.709
Just another
schmuck in a
minivan.

37:26.542 --> 37:29.875
You're all alone
except for Tammy.

37:29.959 --> 37:31.500
'You'd do anything
to keep her under your roof'

37:31.583 --> 37:33.542
'wouldn't you, Vinnie?'

37:33.625 --> 37:37.500
Where I'm from, girls live
at home until they're
married.

37:37.583 --> 37:40.583
- Tradition.
- But Tammy's a modern girl.

37:40.667 --> 37:42.000
You know,
curious about the
world.

37:42.083 --> 37:44.625
Not the kind
to stick around
forever.

37:44.709 --> 37:46.000
[chuckles]
Says you.

37:46.083 --> 37:48.291
Well, you found
the letter she wrote
you.

37:48.375 --> 37:49.583
Said she was leaving.

37:49.667 --> 37:51.875
Going off to sail
the world with Jeff
Feldman.

37:51.959 --> 37:53.583
Don't know
what you're talking about.

37:53.667 --> 37:58.000
No more chicken piccata and
"High School Musical" for
you.

37:58.083 --> 37:59.667
Just you and a frozen pizza

37:59.750 --> 38:01.458
staring at the wall
like a caged rat.

38:01.542 --> 38:04.125
[chuckles]
Detective, you got
some imagination.

38:04.208 --> 38:06.125
'And no way you were gonna
let her abandon you like
that.'

38:06.208 --> 38:07.875
'So you went down
the shore looking for her.'

38:07.959 --> 38:10.000
But you found
Ben first, didn't
you?

38:10.083 --> 38:11.834
The last time I
saw Ben was at the meet

38:11.917 --> 38:13.500
just like I told you.

38:13.583 --> 38:16.709
You thought you'd take one of
the major bridges into Philly.

38:16.792 --> 38:19.000
But if I had
a body in my
trunk

38:19.083 --> 38:21.375
I'd take
the Tacony-Palmyra,
too.

38:25.667 --> 38:27.667
I got you driving
a dead man's car.

38:27.750 --> 38:31.667
Phone records proving you called
Tammy from Cape May that night.

38:31.750 --> 38:34.375
'Got your minivan ticketed
for overtime parking'

38:34.458 --> 38:36.291
'on Main Street
in Cape May.'

38:36.375 --> 38:38.250
'See, it's over, Vinnie.'

38:38.333 --> 38:40.083
Talk second chances
till you're blue in the
face.

38:40.166 --> 38:42.667
Tigers don't
change their stripes.

38:54.583 --> 38:55.917
I need protective custody.

38:57.542 --> 38:59.375
And I wanna see my daughter.

39:05.834 --> 39:07.583
Need it in writing.

39:13.000 --> 39:14.250
Where you gonna put me?

39:17.333 --> 39:19.542
Find a nice pen close to Tammy.

39:21.667 --> 39:24.375
Be difficult.
You're going to Rhode
Island.

39:24.458 --> 39:27.625
See just how vindictive
Ghiacconi's crew can be.

39:32.333 --> 39:34.667
I am a family man.

39:37.417 --> 39:39.959
Tammy was all that I had left.

39:44.542 --> 39:47.083
Everything I did
was for my daughter.

39:55.375 --> 39:56.458
Where's Tammy?

39:56.542 --> 39:57.667
What are you doing here, Vinnie?

39:57.750 --> 39:59.041
I'm looking for my daughter.

39:59.125 --> 40:00.458
(Ben)
Why would she be here?

40:00.542 --> 40:03.750
She left a letter saying
she's going away with Jeff.

40:03.834 --> 40:06.125
Ah, she's the girl he was
trying to impress at the
meet.

40:06.208 --> 40:08.792
I found directions to the Cape
May Motel on her computer.

40:08.875 --> 40:10.125
- Now where is she?
- I haven't seen her.

40:10.208 --> 40:11.583
I left Jeff a couple hours ago.

40:11.667 --> 40:13.458
I gotta find her.
Where, where's Jeff?

40:13.542 --> 40:16.834
Vinnie, calm down. You're gonna
give yourself a heart attack.

40:18.875 --> 40:21.709
I'm asking
you a question.

40:21.792 --> 40:22.959
Where's your son?

40:24.250 --> 40:26.333
I'm not gonna
tell you that,
Vinnie.

40:28.959 --> 40:32.667
- What?
- I'm letting him go.

40:32.750 --> 40:34.417
This is no life for a kid.

40:34.500 --> 40:36.875
If he wants to travel
the world, I'm gonna let him.

40:36.959 --> 40:38.709
You might wanna do the same.

40:40.750 --> 40:43.667
So that's it?
"See ya later. Bye?"

40:43.750 --> 40:47.041
Our kids have suffered
enough for our
mistakes.

40:48.583 --> 40:49.917
You're some kind of father.

40:50.000 --> 40:52.333
Well, I'm doing
the best I can.

40:55.959 --> 40:57.709
Where's Jeff?

41:04.166 --> 41:05.125
Son of a bitch!

41:14.291 --> 41:15.458
Honey?

41:15.542 --> 41:18.875
Hey, daddy,
I just saw you called.

41:18.959 --> 41:21.667
(Vinnie)
'Where are you? I've been
looking everywhere for you.'

41:21.750 --> 41:23.792
(Tammy)
'I was just studying
with some friends.'

41:23.875 --> 41:26.125
'I'll be home soon, okay?'

43:58.083 --> 43:59.291
