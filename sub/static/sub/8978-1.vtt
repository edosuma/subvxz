01:48.741 --> 01:52.233
-Jer, clean or dirty?
-Marginal.

01:53.179 --> 01:54.646
No, it's not.

02:00.653 --> 02:04.817
I don't know why you use that thing.
I mean, if it's for me, it's not necessary.

02:06.659 --> 02:09.787
-Of course, I do like to watch you use it.
-I know.

02:12.966 --> 02:15.594
Listen, I think we should wait
with the powder room.

02:15.702 --> 02:17.863
Nope, no more waiting for toilets.

02:18.538 --> 02:22.975
I just don't like to see you worrying
about loans and mortgages, that's all.

02:23.076 --> 02:24.634
Then don't look.

02:27.847 --> 02:29.906
I don't think we should spend money--

02:30.016 --> 02:32.211
No more thinking tonight! Let's watch TV.

02:35.021 --> 02:36.716
Is there any good mail today?

02:36.823 --> 02:40.156
A couple of junk, some bills,
and a letter for you.

02:52.071 --> 02:53.299
Read this.

02:55.842 --> 02:57.867
"God grants you an interview.

02:57.977 --> 03:00.480
"1600 North Hope Street,
Los Angeles, California.

03:00.480 --> 03:04.075
"Room 2700. Tomorrow at 11:00 a.m."

03:05.985 --> 03:07.418
It's a gag.

03:08.421 --> 03:11.982
No stamp, no return address?
Pretty crazy gag.

03:13.560 --> 03:15.323
-It's an ad.
-For what?

03:16.563 --> 03:20.499
For God oven cleaner, or God detergent,
or I don't know.

03:20.600 --> 03:22.124
Nobody would dare.

03:32.245 --> 03:33.473
Air ball.

03:35.181 --> 03:36.580
Artie Coogan.

03:37.317 --> 03:40.411
-What?
-Artie Coogan, that's it.

03:40.620 --> 03:41.746
Yeah.

03:43.056 --> 03:44.353
Crazy Artie.

03:44.457 --> 03:47.654
No, an English teacher
wouldn't misspell "interview."

03:49.495 --> 03:51.122
Neither would God.

03:52.332 --> 03:56.359
I can't meet him tomorrow. I've got
to meet the District Produce Manager.

03:56.469 --> 03:58.403
-Sorry, God.
-Two points.

04:04.811 --> 04:06.904
Did we make love last night?

04:10.650 --> 04:12.117
Just checking.

04:12.852 --> 04:14.342
Keep checking.

04:16.356 --> 04:17.687
I love you.

04:38.077 --> 04:39.806
Honey, it's so late.

05:26.793 --> 05:28.351
That was two points.

05:51.384 --> 05:54.251
-Wash your hands, Norman.
-We were just....

05:54.354 --> 05:56.914
Good morning, Mr. McCarthy.
I'm sorry to be late, sir.

05:57.056 --> 05:58.990
Landers. Hold it.

06:00.293 --> 06:05.094
Is this how you've instructed your staff
to prepare romaine lettuce for display?

06:05.198 --> 06:08.395
I know what you're getting at,
and I had the same argument...

06:08.501 --> 06:11.436
-...with the last district manager.
-Please answer.

06:14.207 --> 06:15.504
Yes, I do.

06:18.411 --> 06:21.073
Why would anyone buy that...

06:21.180 --> 06:25.116
...when they could get this
for the same price?

06:25.718 --> 06:30.655
Mr. McCarthy, if I put this head of lettuce
in the bin, it's going to stay there all day...

06:30.757 --> 06:33.248
...it'll be there tomorrow
and the next day...

06:33.359 --> 06:35.350
...and we will wind up
throwing it away.

06:35.461 --> 06:36.485
Our other stores--

06:36.596 --> 06:39.588
They do not have a Ralph's up the street
and a Lucky Market...

06:39.699 --> 06:42.429
...right around the corner
who trim even closer than I do.

06:42.535 --> 06:45.095
Now, I know my customers, Mr. McCarthy.

06:46.973 --> 06:48.133
I see.

07:00.052 --> 07:01.212
Landers?

07:02.255 --> 07:05.520
I also noticed that you haven't been
oiling your cukes.

07:05.725 --> 07:09.320
-What?
-Why haven't you been oiling your cukes?

07:11.931 --> 07:15.992
It takes time, it takes oil,
it's dishonest, Mr. McCarthy.

07:16.102 --> 07:19.037
-Dishonest?
-Sir, there's an interview that I--

07:19.138 --> 07:22.039
Look, our company has
certain policies, which--

07:22.141 --> 07:23.904
I have an interview with....

07:24.010 --> 07:25.068
You have a what?

07:26.879 --> 07:28.904
Thank you very much.

08:53.866 --> 08:55.060
<i>Stay.</i>

08:57.570 --> 08:58.832
What is this?

08:58.938 --> 09:03.375
<i>You're right on time. I like that.</i>
<i>Close the door.</i>

09:06.646 --> 09:08.944
-Who are you?
<i>-You read the note.</i>

09:12.151 --> 09:14.381
-Who is that, Artie?
<i>-God.</i>

09:14.820 --> 09:18.449
-Come on, Artie.
<i>-No, it's me, God.</i>

09:19.759 --> 09:21.624
-God?
<i>-Right, God.</i>

09:22.061 --> 09:24.791
<i>God Almighty. Big "G."</i>

09:33.072 --> 09:35.165
<i>It's not a gag, I promise.</i>

09:38.778 --> 09:41.611
<i>-Where you going?</i>
-I've got this load of plums coming in.

09:41.714 --> 09:44.842
<i>Let the plums wait.</i>
<i>How often do you talk with God?</i>

09:47.119 --> 09:48.643
Practically never.

09:55.161 --> 09:58.688
How do I know you're God?
All I hear is a voice on an intercom.

09:58.831 --> 10:00.958
<i>You're not allowed to see me.</i>

10:01.534 --> 10:03.468
-Why not?
<i>-Because.</i>

10:04.370 --> 10:06.702
-That's no answer.
<i>-Sue me.</i>

10:08.474 --> 10:10.442
-lf you're God....
<i>-Yeah?</i>

10:11.077 --> 10:13.705
-lf you're really God....
<i>-Yeah?</i>

10:16.816 --> 10:18.681
<i>If I'm really God, what?</i>

10:23.489 --> 10:25.150
<i>-You leaving?</i>
-Right the first time.

10:25.257 --> 10:27.725
<i>Where are you leaving?</i>
<i>Where do you think you are?</i>

10:27.860 --> 10:30.693
What do you mean, where?
Right here is where, that's where.

10:30.796 --> 10:35.529
<i>-And where is here?</i>
-1600 North Hope Street, Room 2700.

10:35.868 --> 10:37.130
<i>Jerry.</i>

10:38.304 --> 10:41.034
<i>There's no Room 2700 in this building.</i>

10:43.142 --> 10:45.269
<i>There's no 27th floor here.</i>

10:48.914 --> 10:51.883
<i>I thought, this way</i>
<i>we'd have a little privacy.</i>

10:52.385 --> 10:54.853
<i>Check it out. Go ahead, I'll wait.</i>

11:19.712 --> 11:21.009
-Sir?
-Yes, sir?

11:21.113 --> 11:24.708
How do I get to the 27th floor?

11:24.817 --> 11:26.079
-In this building?
-Yeah.

11:26.185 --> 11:29.814
I'm afraid you'd need a can opener.
We only have 17 floors.

11:32.058 --> 11:33.355
Seventeen.

12:51.804 --> 12:53.396
<i>Have a nice ride?</i>

12:54.106 --> 12:55.300
<i>Come in.</i>

12:57.143 --> 12:58.633
<i>Close the door.</i>

13:02.281 --> 13:03.543
<i>Sit down.</i>

13:17.830 --> 13:19.127
<i>Go ahead.</i>

13:24.203 --> 13:25.329
<i>Relax.</i>

13:27.039 --> 13:28.370
<i>Don't smoke.</i>

13:29.341 --> 13:31.172
-I don't.
<i>-Good.</i>

13:31.744 --> 13:33.712
<i>Tobacco was one of my big mistakes.</i>

13:35.281 --> 13:37.374
-Mistakes?
<i>-You try.</i>

13:38.484 --> 13:43.319
<i>Ostriches were a mistake.</i>
<i>Silly looking things. Avocados.</i>

13:43.889 --> 13:47.518
<i>Made the pit too big. Like I say, "You try."</i>

13:49.895 --> 13:51.954
<i>You still don't believe it?</i>

13:53.866 --> 13:56.858
Artie, if this is you, you win.

13:57.069 --> 14:00.596
-This is the best gag you've ever pulled.
<i>-I'm not Artie.</i>

14:00.739 --> 14:04.402
<i>Went to a lot of trouble to make it</i>
<i>a comfortable interview.</i>

14:04.910 --> 14:06.377
You misspelled it, you know.

14:06.512 --> 14:08.207
<i>-What?</i>
-"Interview."

14:09.982 --> 14:11.677
In your note.

14:11.951 --> 14:14.385
It's "I"....

14:15.988 --> 14:18.513
It's "I" before "E."

14:18.757 --> 14:23.694
<i>Give me a break. A few things, I got right.</i>
<i>I put summer before winter, didn't I?</i>

14:26.498 --> 14:27.931
<i>You're scared.</i>

14:28.300 --> 14:31.565
Well, sure. But look, if this is a joke,
it's gone too far.

14:31.670 --> 14:33.103
<i>It's no joke.</i>

14:33.806 --> 14:38.243
How come you've got such a....
Just a voice, like everybody's?

14:38.644 --> 14:41.943
<i>Empathy. I'm talking to you</i>
<i>in a way you can accept.</i>

14:42.314 --> 14:43.747
<i>I'm relating.</i>

14:44.083 --> 14:47.814
<i>I don't like to brag,</i>
<i>but if I appeared to you just as God...</i>

14:47.920 --> 14:51.856
<i>...how I really am, what I really am,</i>
<i>your mind couldn't grasp it.</i>

14:52.291 --> 14:55.226
I think you made a mistake.
I'm not religious.

14:55.327 --> 14:56.419
<i>So?</i>

14:56.528 --> 15:00.828
I'm not one of your believers.
And I sure as heck don't believe this.

15:00.933 --> 15:04.300
<i>That's why I showed up.</i>
<i>Too many nonbelievers.</i>

15:04.770 --> 15:08.297
But I read in an article
that religion is on the upswing.

15:08.440 --> 15:13.139
<i>Religion is easy, I'm talking about faith.</i>
<i>You're going to help me change that.</i>

15:13.846 --> 15:14.813
Me?

15:14.914 --> 15:18.372
-I don't belong to any church.
<i>-Neither do I.</i>

15:19.184 --> 15:22.449
<i>Go back to work.</i>
<i>I don't want you to get in trouble.</i>

15:23.489 --> 15:24.820
Thank you.

15:25.691 --> 15:27.625
<i>We'll talk on the way.</i>

15:28.327 --> 15:31.660
-How?
<i>-Trust me. Like it says on the money.</i>

15:43.909 --> 15:46.241
Sir? Are you all right, sir?

15:48.714 --> 15:49.476
No.

15:56.422 --> 15:57.548
<i>Jerry.</i>

16:02.394 --> 16:05.124
<i>-You want me to talk louder?</i>
-Oh, God.

16:06.031 --> 16:08.499
<i>I thought you didn't believe in me?</i>

16:09.601 --> 16:11.034
That's just an expression.

16:11.136 --> 16:14.037
<i>I'm more than that,</i>
<i>and I want you to spread the word.</i>

16:14.139 --> 16:15.231
Me?

16:16.008 --> 16:19.273
-Spread what word?
<i>-That I am. I exist.</i>

16:19.878 --> 16:21.709
<i>That we've spoken.</i>

16:22.681 --> 16:26.048
You want me to tell people
that I've spoken with God?

16:26.385 --> 16:28.649
<i>-Yes.</i>
-They'll put me away.

16:28.854 --> 16:33.086
<i>I'm tired of all the talk that I may be dead,</i>
<i>or that I never was at all.</i>

16:33.192 --> 16:36.958
<i>Or that God was just</i>
<i>particles of cosmos. Gas.</i>

16:37.396 --> 16:40.627
<i>I'm not gas. I found that very insulting.</i>

16:41.667 --> 16:46.036
-Do you actually expect people to believe--
<i>-That's your job.</i>

16:47.506 --> 16:51.306
But I'm just a man. I'm no Moses.

16:51.410 --> 16:55.039
<i>What was Moses?</i>
<i>Do you think Moses was born on Page 1?</i>

16:55.414 --> 16:58.611
<i>Moses was just a messenger,</i>
<i>my messenger.</i>

17:03.355 --> 17:04.617
Look....

17:05.656 --> 17:07.181
God, if....

17:08.359 --> 17:12.296
If I tell people
that I spoke with God, they....

17:18.103 --> 17:22.335
<i>And now an oldie but a goodie,</i>
<i>Jerry Gray and</i> A String of Pearls.

17:31.884 --> 17:32.976
God?

17:38.857 --> 17:42.293
<i>Top-ten time on KGOD. What is it, Jerry?</i>

17:42.428 --> 17:46.831
That guy on the motorcycle thinks
I'm a nut. Is that the kind of God you are?

17:46.965 --> 17:50.025
-How come you didn't let him hear you?
<i>-That's a policy of mine.</i>

17:50.169 --> 17:53.332
<i>I try not to work with</i>
<i>more than one savior at a time.</i>

17:53.472 --> 17:55.667
Savior? Me?

17:56.408 --> 18:01.345
<i>-You do your job right....</i>
-I can't take this job. I don't believe--

18:01.513 --> 18:05.813
<i>I know, but even nonbelievers want</i>
<i>what they've got down here to work.</i>

18:06.885 --> 18:10.184
Have you read the papers lately?
It ain't working.

18:10.622 --> 18:14.718
<i>That's why I came, to tell everybody</i>
<i>I set the world up so it can work.</i>

18:14.860 --> 18:18.489
<i>Only, it's up to you.</i>
<i>You can't look to me to do it for you.</i>

18:18.797 --> 18:19.764
No.

18:20.866 --> 18:23.426
<i>You can do it. It's only one message.</i>

18:23.569 --> 18:27.130
<i>-Moses had to handle ten.</i>
-But you gave him tablets.

18:27.272 --> 18:30.139
<i>-He had a bad memory.</i>
-I need something.

18:30.409 --> 18:32.274
<i>What kind of something?</i>

18:33.579 --> 18:37.174
I don't know. Anything. A tape recording.

18:37.449 --> 18:41.385
<i>My voice wouldn't come out on tape.</i>
<i>It's very complicated.</i>

18:41.854 --> 18:45.813
<i>It's like, you know how Dracula</i>
<i>can't see himself in a mirror?</i>

18:46.558 --> 18:47.855
<i>It's along those lines.</i>

18:49.061 --> 18:51.120
If people could just hear your voice--

18:51.230 --> 18:55.826
<i>This isn't even how I sound. I'm talking</i>
<i>like this so that you'll understand me.</i>

18:55.934 --> 18:59.165
Understand? I don't understand anything.

18:59.471 --> 19:02.065
<i>That's a beginning. Over and out.</i>

19:03.075 --> 19:05.771
Hold it. Don't hang up on me.

19:05.978 --> 19:09.505
<i>You just went through a red light.</i>
<i>You're going to get yourself killed.</i>

19:09.615 --> 19:10.980
<i>I need you down here.</i>

19:16.421 --> 19:20.357
I have some nice, fresh chicken soup.
Why don't you let me fix you a bowl?

19:38.076 --> 19:40.636
Is that all I can get from you? Soup?

19:41.613 --> 19:43.808
-You know what, darling?
-What?

19:45.217 --> 19:49.916
Why don't you and I take a few days off
and go on a little holiday?

19:51.623 --> 19:53.887
-A holiday?
-Yeah.

19:54.626 --> 19:57.720
We could go to San Francisco.

19:58.630 --> 20:01.758
You haven't even seen
your sister's new baby yet.

20:04.937 --> 20:08.998
You don't want me to see my sister's baby.
You want me to see my sister's husband.

20:09.107 --> 20:13.066
I am not crazy, and I don't need
some child psychiatrist to tell me...

20:13.178 --> 20:16.045
...that I didn't talk to God, because I did.

20:19.952 --> 20:22.887
-On an intercom.
-And on the car radio.

20:24.923 --> 20:27.289
Yes, Jerry.

20:27.859 --> 20:31.659
Do you remember when Artie Coogan
set up that hidden microphone...

20:31.763 --> 20:35.392
...and he broadcast those filthy limericks
through the television set?

20:35.500 --> 20:37.297
It was not Artie.

20:37.936 --> 20:40.029
I know all of Artie's voices.

20:40.138 --> 20:44.768
Artie is not capable of adding 10 stories
to a building that doesn't have them.

20:44.876 --> 20:47.538
He cannot talk back and forth
through a car radio...

20:47.646 --> 20:49.511
...that's been busted for two months.

20:49.615 --> 20:53.016
Whoever the hell this guy is,
he's very smart.

20:53.552 --> 20:55.383
And I'm going to listen to him.

20:56.955 --> 20:59.389
-For a while.
-And you think it's God?

20:59.925 --> 21:04.487
Well, he thinks he's God.
And I'm in no position to argue with him.

21:07.766 --> 21:11.202
-I thought you believed in him.
-I do. I believe in God.

21:11.303 --> 21:14.534
I just don't believe that he exists.
I mean, in the sense...

21:14.640 --> 21:19.577
...that he repaints floor numbers in office
buildings or doubles as a disc jockey.

21:20.012 --> 21:22.037
Well, that is what he does.

21:23.715 --> 21:26.411
And he wants you
to give his message to the world?

21:26.518 --> 21:27.542
Yes.

21:28.320 --> 21:31.983
Jerry, does he know
how you feel about him?

21:32.424 --> 21:35.359
I told him. Doesn't seem to bother him.

21:40.065 --> 21:42.556
So is that all he told you?

21:43.235 --> 21:45.100
That you're going to be the savior?

21:45.203 --> 21:49.162
And that to tell everybody,
what we have down here can work?

21:49.608 --> 21:50.540
Yes.

21:50.676 --> 21:53.873
He also told me,
he's very disappointed in avocados.

21:54.913 --> 21:58.110
-He is?
-He said he made the pit too big.

22:02.387 --> 22:03.854
I am not crazy!

22:06.692 --> 22:07.818
Jerry?

22:17.536 --> 22:19.970
I let you sleep a little later.

22:20.238 --> 22:22.672
I'll take the kids to school, okay?

22:26.845 --> 22:28.312
How do you feel?

22:29.681 --> 22:31.512
You know, about....

22:35.787 --> 22:39.223
I almost forgot. I'm fine.

22:42.828 --> 22:43.920
Good.

22:45.364 --> 22:47.355
Because, you know, I was thinking...

22:47.499 --> 22:50.798
...you didn't actually see,
all you did was hear.

22:51.536 --> 22:53.470
And you know what they say.

22:53.572 --> 22:56.405
-What?
-Seeing is believing.

22:57.008 --> 22:58.202
Not hearing.

22:59.644 --> 23:02.909
-What about Ingrid Bergman?
-Ingrid Bergman?

23:05.350 --> 23:08.148
Joan of Arc. She played Joan of Arc.

23:09.855 --> 23:11.220
Joan of Arc.

23:12.858 --> 23:16.954
Joan didn't see either.
She just heard, like me.

23:27.606 --> 23:28.766
<i>Jerry?</i>

23:33.078 --> 23:35.069
-Oh, God.
<i>-That's right.</i>

23:38.683 --> 23:40.913
-Is that you?
<i>-In person.</i>

23:43.789 --> 23:47.225
-You're not on the radio?
<i>-Have you got a radio out here?</i>

23:48.226 --> 23:49.818
-No.
<i>-Bingo.</i>

23:50.896 --> 23:51.920
You're here?

23:54.332 --> 23:56.926
-In my bathroom?
<i>-Come take a look.</i>

23:58.336 --> 24:02.773
-I can't. I'm naked.
<i>-You think I don't know what you've got?</i>

24:03.608 --> 24:06.372
That was another little goof of mine.
Shame.

24:06.945 --> 24:09.539
<i>I don't know why</i>
<i>I thought we needed shame.</i>

24:10.649 --> 24:12.014
<i>Come on out.</i>

24:24.996 --> 24:26.486
<i>Don't catch cold.</i>

24:34.673 --> 24:36.641
Not what you expected?

24:43.114 --> 24:45.082
I picked a look you could understand.

24:45.183 --> 24:47.174
For someone else,
I would've looked different.

24:47.285 --> 24:51.449
I could do any face, voice, whatever.
I could even be a woman.

24:53.291 --> 24:56.886
-Feeling a little strange?
-Very strange.

24:57.128 --> 24:59.062
Like you're going to faint?

25:00.565 --> 25:02.658
You know what's good for that?

25:03.368 --> 25:04.335
Shaving.

25:05.804 --> 25:08.272
-Shaving?
-Sometimes when you don't feel normal...

25:08.373 --> 25:10.864
...doing a normal thing
makes you feel normal.

25:10.976 --> 25:12.136
Here, start shaving.

25:31.196 --> 25:32.458
Go ahead.

25:32.831 --> 25:33.798
I am.

25:33.899 --> 25:35.423
I don't mean with the shaving...

25:35.534 --> 25:38.128
...with the questions
that are popping into your head.

25:40.605 --> 25:41.629
Yeah.

25:44.342 --> 25:46.810
-Why me?
-Why not you?

25:48.113 --> 25:49.671
You mean, there's no special--

25:49.781 --> 25:53.581
Life is a crap shoot, like the millionth
customer who crosses a bridge...

25:53.685 --> 25:55.880
...gets to shake hands with the governor.

25:56.154 --> 25:59.089
You thought I picked you
because you're better than everybody?

25:59.190 --> 26:00.157
I'm not?

26:00.258 --> 26:02.522
You're better than some,
but not as good as others.

26:02.661 --> 26:04.822
But you crossed the bridge
at the right time.

26:04.963 --> 26:09.662
If you wanted to see me,
why didn't you just appear over my bed?

26:10.936 --> 26:13.404
Hollywood. Next question.

26:20.078 --> 26:24.708
People are always praying to you.
Do you listen?

26:25.617 --> 26:28.518
I can't help hearing. I don't always listen.

26:29.020 --> 26:31.682
-Then you don't care?
-Of course I care.

26:32.123 --> 26:34.455
I care plenty. But what can I do?

26:34.559 --> 26:36.493
What can you do?

26:37.429 --> 26:38.396
You're God.

26:38.530 --> 26:41.693
Only for the big picture.
I don't get into details.

26:41.833 --> 26:44.267
Then whatever happens to us--

26:44.402 --> 26:47.166
Happens. Here, I put in a new blade.

26:48.840 --> 26:51.206
You mean, there's no plan...

26:51.309 --> 26:54.540
...no scheme to guide our destinies?

26:55.547 --> 26:59.608
-A lot of it is luck.
-Luck? Just luck?

27:01.486 --> 27:04.717
Put on a little toilet paper.
I'll get you a piece.

27:08.226 --> 27:12.595
-You don't control our lives?
-I gave you a world and everything in it.

27:13.198 --> 27:14.961
It's all up to you.

27:15.066 --> 27:19.901
-But we need help.
-That's why I gave you each other. Here.

27:22.107 --> 27:25.770
With your powers,
you could solve so many problems.

27:27.178 --> 27:28.577
Don't wet it.

27:29.981 --> 27:32.074
-Are you sure?
-Am I sure?

27:32.651 --> 27:34.983
Did I do a good job on the Grand Canyon?

27:38.223 --> 27:42.785
Anyway, why don't you?
Solve all our problems.

27:43.028 --> 27:47.158
-Work a few miracles.
-I don't do miracles. They're too flashy.

27:47.532 --> 27:49.557
And they upset the natural balance.

27:50.368 --> 27:53.166
No miracles? I knew it.

27:54.205 --> 27:57.003
Maybe now and then,
just to keep my hand in.

27:57.108 --> 28:00.339
The last miracle I did was the 1969 Mets.

28:01.546 --> 28:04.242
Before that,
I think you have to go back to the Red Sea.

28:04.716 --> 28:06.206
That was a beauty.

28:07.052 --> 28:10.180
No offense,
but I don't believe the Red Sea...

28:10.288 --> 28:13.416
...and I don't believe
six days to create the world.

28:13.658 --> 28:14.955
You're right.

28:15.326 --> 28:16.953
-I am?
-Tell you the truth...

28:17.062 --> 28:20.725
...I thought about it for five days
and did the whole job in one.

28:20.832 --> 28:22.663
I'm really best under pressure.

28:23.535 --> 28:28.097
-One day to create the world?
-And the sun. I hate to work in the dark.

28:28.606 --> 28:29.937
You have to remember...

28:30.041 --> 28:33.306
...that one of my days
is not exactly one of yours.

28:33.411 --> 28:34.400
How long are they?

28:34.512 --> 28:37.913
When I got up this morning,
Sigmund Freud was still in medical school.

28:44.923 --> 28:47.687
-lf you're so involved with us....
-Yeah?

28:48.159 --> 28:51.526
How can you permit all the suffering
that goes on in the world?

28:52.831 --> 28:55.299
-How can I permit the suffering?
-Yeah.

28:55.400 --> 28:57.868
I don't permit the suffering. You do.

28:57.969 --> 29:00.836
Free will. All the choices are yours.

29:01.206 --> 29:03.606
Choices? What choices?

29:03.875 --> 29:08.209
You can love, cherish and nurture
each other, or you can kill each other.

29:08.313 --> 29:12.181
Incidentally, "kill" is the word.
It's not "waste."

29:12.684 --> 29:16.176
If I meant "waste," I would have written,
"Thou shalt not waste."

29:16.287 --> 29:18.983
You're doing some very funny things
with words here.

29:19.090 --> 29:23.857
You're also turning the sky into mud.
I look down, I don't believe the filth.

29:24.362 --> 29:27.889
Using rivers for toilets,
poisoning my fishes.

29:28.767 --> 29:32.965
You want a miracle?
You make a fish from scratch. You can't.

29:33.271 --> 29:37.298
You think only God can make a tree?
Try coming up with a mackerel.

29:37.876 --> 29:40.504
And when the last one is gone,
that'll be that.

29:40.678 --> 29:45.638
Eighty-six on the fishes. Good-bye, sky.
So long, world. Over and out.

29:46.184 --> 29:50.211
-I thought you said we would make it.
-I said, you have to make it work.

29:51.055 --> 29:53.353
-You don't care.
-I do care.

29:53.625 --> 29:58.221
-Then do something about it.
-I did. I got you to carry the ball.

30:00.632 --> 30:05.569
-I got no ball. How can I carry it?
-I gave you a mouth, didn't I?

30:06.104 --> 30:08.664
Tell people how I feel, what I said.

30:10.241 --> 30:11.572
How do I do that?

30:11.676 --> 30:14.076
How did you get to be
an assistant manager?

30:14.212 --> 30:17.147
Did you ever hear of
newspapers, reporters?

30:17.682 --> 30:21.778
You got a scoop here, an exclusive,
a hold-the-presses.

30:22.287 --> 30:23.276
Fine.

30:25.557 --> 30:29.288
And how do I convince anybody
that I've actually seen you?

30:29.427 --> 30:32.055
-That you exist?
-Simple.

30:34.699 --> 30:35.791
Show them this.

30:47.111 --> 30:51.138
-Your card?
-No, it's not my card. It's God's card.

30:52.116 --> 30:54.141
-It's God's card?
-Look at it.

30:54.619 --> 30:55.677
I am.

30:56.955 --> 31:00.118
-Do you know where I got it?
-At a novelty store?

31:01.426 --> 31:03.792
-God gave it to me.
-Did he?

31:04.896 --> 31:09.765
-May I ask when and where you got it?
-This morning, in my bathroom.

31:10.902 --> 31:13.462
God visited you in your bathroom
this morning?

31:13.605 --> 31:14.663
Yes.

31:16.040 --> 31:18.338
Sounds crazy to you, doesn't it?

31:18.810 --> 31:21.745
Yesterday,
he was just a voice on an intercom...

31:21.880 --> 31:24.075
...and then he was on the radio.

31:24.515 --> 31:27.382
-God spoke to you on the radio?
-In my car.

31:27.585 --> 31:29.246
-What station?
-All stations.

31:29.354 --> 31:33.791
Right. And then this morning,
he showed up in your bathroom?

31:34.259 --> 31:35.248
Yes.

31:35.760 --> 31:40.322
Why do you suppose
the Almighty spoke to you, Mr.--

31:40.431 --> 31:42.365
-Landers.
-Mr. Landers.

31:42.500 --> 31:46.869
Jerry Landers. He said that he wanted
me to be his messenger, like Moses.

31:48.973 --> 31:51.942
What sort of work do you do, Mr. Landers?

31:52.043 --> 31:54.944
I'm the assistant manager
of Food World in Burbank.

31:55.146 --> 31:59.082
I see. Then you don't speak
to God every day.

31:59.784 --> 32:01.649
Never before yesterday.

32:05.290 --> 32:10.091
Did God say why he needed a messenger...

32:10.194 --> 32:14.824
-...at this particular time, Mr. Landers?
-Yes, he was very specific.

32:15.266 --> 32:18.497
He said that he wanted us to know
that it can work.

32:21.005 --> 32:23.633
-What "it" is that?
-Us "it."

32:24.042 --> 32:27.341
Our lives, our world, everything.

32:27.979 --> 32:32.678
He says that he's given us everything
that we need, and it's entirely up to us.

32:32.850 --> 32:36.809
-And those were his exact words?
-Close enough. You can print that.

32:36.955 --> 32:40.482
Did God specify the <i>Los Angeles Times?</i>

32:41.492 --> 32:43.289
That was my idea.

32:44.162 --> 32:46.153
Well, we're very grateful.

32:47.799 --> 32:48.891
I'm not a nut.

32:50.034 --> 32:52.832
-I didn't say that you were.
-I'm not even religious.

32:53.371 --> 32:56.966
Yes, thank you very much, Mr. Landers,
for bringing us this story.

32:57.075 --> 32:59.066
Look, don't brush me off.

33:00.044 --> 33:03.878
Do me a favor, and look at that card again.
Take a good hard look at it.

33:04.282 --> 33:05.476
Certainly.

33:08.219 --> 33:11.916
Now, does that look like something
I'd get at a novelty shop?

33:12.390 --> 33:13.414
Yes.

33:31.642 --> 33:35.203
Norman, did you just put a bag of potatoes
on top of that white bread?

33:35.313 --> 33:36.575
No, sir.

33:41.886 --> 33:45.185
-I think you did.
<i>-Mr. Landers, please come to Aisle 10.</i>

33:45.289 --> 33:46.950
<i>Aisle 10, please.</i>

33:48.326 --> 33:49.418
Did you hear that, Norman?

33:49.527 --> 33:52.257
Yes, never put a bag of potatoes
on top of a white bread.

33:52.363 --> 33:54.957
No, the page. I was just paged.
Did you hear that?

33:55.066 --> 33:57.796
I didn't hear anything. Did I?

33:59.837 --> 34:03.273
We'll get you a new white bread, ma'am.
Take care of it.

34:08.946 --> 34:10.004
God?

34:10.915 --> 34:15.215
Chemicals, all chemicals.
Turning kids into garbage cans.

34:16.286 --> 34:19.222
Jerry, I didn't see one word
in the newspapers.

34:19.322 --> 34:20.585
Of course not.

34:20.690 --> 34:24.149
That guy at the <i>Times</i> kept looking
at me like I was some kind of lunatic.

34:24.262 --> 34:25.422
And I felt like one.

34:27.398 --> 34:29.764
-Did you show him my card?
-Sure I did.

34:29.867 --> 34:33.303
And he said, "You can get one of those
in any novelty store."

34:33.704 --> 34:38.664
Here. You know, I really felt like an idiot.
Please, don't do that to me again.

34:40.978 --> 34:43.344
-You said what I said?
-Absolutely.

34:43.681 --> 34:46.616
And they didn't find God's word
fit to print?

34:47.585 --> 34:49.518
Some tough cookies, boy.

34:49.687 --> 34:51.210
-Did you get the Coke?
-Yes.

34:51.355 --> 34:52.947
I have Cup-a-Soup.

34:55.993 --> 34:57.620
-Good morning, Mrs. Levin.
-Hi.

34:57.762 --> 34:59.627
-Mrs. Green.
-Hi, Jerry.

35:00.098 --> 35:02.566
You know, I'd like you to meet....

35:07.939 --> 35:10.032
-You did it to me again.
-What'd she do?

35:12.009 --> 35:13.067
What?

35:14.812 --> 35:16.143
Nothing.

35:16.781 --> 35:18.715
-Can I help you ladies?
-No.

35:18.850 --> 35:21.410
-We're all right.
-Yes, thank you.

35:23.221 --> 35:25.746
-What was that all about?
-I don't know.

35:30.962 --> 35:34.363
-Why did you change on me?
-Why did you start to introduce me?

35:34.499 --> 35:36.626
I don't want to be
the only guy in the world--

35:36.734 --> 35:39.669
Look, I can't make appearances all over.
Don't you understand?

35:39.770 --> 35:43.103
-No, I don't.
-People would drop dead from hysterics.

35:43.274 --> 35:45.640
-Mr. Landers?
-This place is too busy.

35:45.910 --> 35:48.003
Can you sign this, please?

35:49.347 --> 35:50.405
<i>Jerry?</i>

35:52.350 --> 35:53.282
<i>Up here.</i>

35:54.552 --> 35:57.680
<i>-Let's go for a ride.</i>
-I'll meet you.

35:57.788 --> 36:00.382
-Where?
-What? Not you.

36:08.833 --> 36:12.826
I can't understand it. Why wouldn't
a religious editor believe you?

36:13.070 --> 36:16.597
Face it, you goofed again,
just like the avocado pit.

36:16.941 --> 36:18.909
You picked the wrong message boy.

36:19.010 --> 36:21.911
-You don't believe I'm here, do you?
-No, I don't.

36:22.647 --> 36:25.445
Then how do you explain
this conversation we're having?

36:25.550 --> 36:27.950
I'm having. I'm dreaming you.

36:28.452 --> 36:31.478
And I ought to be real glad
when I wake up, too.

36:31.923 --> 36:33.788
What color are my eyes?

36:34.692 --> 36:35.886
My eyes?

36:37.695 --> 36:38.753
Blue.

36:39.063 --> 36:40.291
My shirt?

36:40.932 --> 36:43.662
Red plaid.
What does that got to do with anything?

36:43.768 --> 36:46.168
-Do you dream in color?
-No.

36:46.270 --> 36:47.635
Bingo, again.

36:48.806 --> 36:51.104
Okay. All right.

36:52.376 --> 36:53.843
You know a lot of things...

36:53.945 --> 36:56.072
...and you've been making things happen...

36:56.180 --> 36:57.442
...but none of it seems....

36:57.548 --> 36:59.880
-Godlike?
-Yeah. Godlike.

37:00.017 --> 37:01.951
Now, what, to you, would be Godlike?

37:05.890 --> 37:08.484
-Change the weather.
-Special effects?

37:10.127 --> 37:13.858
What would you like?
A little earthquake? Small hurricane?

37:14.131 --> 37:16.497
No, I wouldn't want anybody hurt.

37:17.168 --> 37:20.399
I was just thinking, maybe,
what about a little rain?

37:20.705 --> 37:23.265
-Little rain?
-Yeah. A small shower.

37:23.908 --> 37:26.035
One small shower. You got it.

37:31.682 --> 37:33.115
It's raining.

37:34.185 --> 37:35.777
You made it rain.

37:36.787 --> 37:39.483
You didn't even bat an eye.
You didn't lift a finger.

37:39.590 --> 37:42.855
-Rain's not that hard.
-It's unbelievable.

37:42.960 --> 37:45.895
-Would you like it to rain a little harder?
-No, this is fine.

37:45.997 --> 37:48.693
-How about bigger drops?
-No. This is fine.

37:48.799 --> 37:51.131
Would you care for a little snow?

37:51.369 --> 37:52.666
I don't believe it.

37:56.974 --> 38:00.239
It's not raining outside. It's just in here.

38:00.645 --> 38:02.909
Why should I spoil everybody's day?

38:04.115 --> 38:06.583
-This is fantastic.
-Thank you.

38:06.817 --> 38:10.913
-It's just like Noah's ark.
-Same thing, without the smell.

38:40.718 --> 38:44.654
-What's the problem, officer?
-I was about to ask you.

38:47.625 --> 38:51.220
My radiator must be leaking.
I'm sorry about that.

38:58.703 --> 39:01.365
A radiator doesn't hold that much water.

39:04.342 --> 39:08.472
I must have driven through a car wash
with my windows open?

39:11.082 --> 39:12.674
-That'd do it.
-Yeah.

39:14.919 --> 39:18.582
-Roll up the windows next time.
-Yes, sir, I will. Yes, sir.

39:19.423 --> 39:20.913
Thank you, sir.

39:28.632 --> 39:32.830
-He believed that dumb excuse.
-There's an aura of goodness around you.

39:33.804 --> 39:34.793
You.

39:35.740 --> 39:38.504
Going to try a little harder
to get the word out?

39:40.678 --> 39:43.875
-Yeah! I'll give it another shot!
-That's my boy.

39:44.715 --> 39:46.080
Mr. Briggs.

39:47.318 --> 39:49.286
-You're all wet.
-Of course I'm wet.

39:49.420 --> 39:52.583
I didn't dry myself, I wanted you
to see this. Do you remember me?

39:52.690 --> 39:56.319
Of course. You're the nonbeliever
who spoke to God, twice, I believe.

39:56.427 --> 39:57.655
Four times, now.

39:57.762 --> 40:01.425
-Is he still visiting you in the toilet?
-I just rode with him in my car.

40:01.532 --> 40:03.261
This time, I have got the proof.

40:03.367 --> 40:07.565
-He gave you another calling card?
-No. He made it rain inside the car.

40:07.938 --> 40:11.032
This water that I'm dripping all over here
is water that he made.

40:11.475 --> 40:12.908
This is holy water.

40:14.445 --> 40:18.313
-lf you'll excuse me, I really am in a hurry.
-I will not excuse you, Mr. Briggs!

40:18.416 --> 40:20.475
You are a reporter of religious events...

40:20.584 --> 40:23.985
...and this is the most important
religious event of our time.

40:24.121 --> 40:25.748
And I expect you....

40:25.990 --> 40:28.754
I don't expect, I insist,
that you print his message...

40:28.859 --> 40:31.589
...in your paper and give it
the prominence it deserves.

40:31.695 --> 40:34.220
Or, by God, you'll hear from me again.

40:36.267 --> 40:37.359
Jerry.

40:39.970 --> 40:41.528
No, listen to this.

40:41.739 --> 40:45.539
"It should come as no surprise to anyone
that in these tense-filled times...

40:45.643 --> 40:47.577
"...religious freaks abound.

40:47.678 --> 40:50.442
"From the Bronx cabbie who claims
he drove Mary Magdalene...

40:50.548 --> 40:52.914
"...to the airport last Christmas...." Listen.

40:53.017 --> 40:55.508
"To the Burbank, California,
supermarket manager...

40:55.619 --> 40:59.419
"...who insists he has had
four conversations with God, no less."

40:59.523 --> 41:00.581
What?

41:00.691 --> 41:02.522
"According to this second gentleman...

41:02.626 --> 41:05.959
"...who flashes a calling card
with God's name on it...

41:06.297 --> 41:08.356
"...God wants very much for us to know...

41:08.466 --> 41:12.027
"...He is alive and well and that
our world can work. It's up to us."

41:12.136 --> 41:13.660
Let me see that.

41:14.538 --> 41:16.233
The <i>Los Angeles Times.</i>

41:17.107 --> 41:19.200
-Where is it?
-How could you, for God's....

41:19.310 --> 41:22.108
It's right here, with some terrific company.

41:22.379 --> 41:26.145
See this? A janitor who sleeps all night
tied up on a cross.

41:26.750 --> 41:28.741
Did anybody else say they saw God?

41:28.853 --> 41:33.222
No, but there's an insurance salesman
selling life-after-death policies.

41:33.858 --> 41:38.818
But only you have talked to the Big Boss.
Did you just say that you saw him?

41:40.164 --> 41:42.325
-Yes.
-You didn't just hear him?

41:42.933 --> 41:45.959
One line. That's all they gave it is one line.

41:46.070 --> 41:49.631
-Are you saying now that you saw God?
-Three times, yeah.

41:50.207 --> 41:54.974
-Three times?
-In the bathroom, at work, and in the car.

41:56.847 --> 42:00.339
One lousy line. I don't believe it.

42:09.260 --> 42:11.854
Let's go away for a couple days, okay?

42:12.129 --> 42:16.930
-Bobbie, I know how crazy this all sounds.
-No, you don't.

42:21.539 --> 42:24.303
I saw him. He spoke to me.

42:26.277 --> 42:29.440
All right, let's say, for a minute,
that you saw God--

42:29.547 --> 42:32.573
Look, don't humor me.
That'll really make me crazy.

42:32.683 --> 42:35.413
Okay! You saw him.

42:36.620 --> 42:39.453
-But why is he talking to you?
-Why not me?

42:40.124 --> 42:43.218
Why not the Pope, or Billy Graham,
or somebody way up there?

42:43.327 --> 42:46.421
-He doesn't care about religion.
-God doesn't care about religion?

42:46.530 --> 42:47.690
That's what he said.

42:47.865 --> 42:51.562
He sure picked a funny business
to go into then, didn't he?

42:57.741 --> 42:59.140
I'm sorry, Jerry.

43:06.817 --> 43:09.786
I can't seem to accept the concept of you...

43:09.920 --> 43:14.186
...actually having a real, honest-to-God
conversation with God.

43:14.892 --> 43:18.555
I don't understand
why he wanted to talk to you.

43:21.765 --> 43:25.462
God, listen to me, this whole thing
is making me nuts now, too.

43:25.836 --> 43:26.803
Too?

43:27.404 --> 43:30.202
-You do think I'm crazy.
-No.

43:32.409 --> 43:34.377
I don't think you're crazy.

43:35.212 --> 43:37.476
Which is why I think I'm crazy.

43:38.716 --> 43:42.277
Bobbie, how can I convince anyone at all,
if I can't convince you?

43:45.089 --> 43:48.786
Jerry, for some reason
that I can't even begin to fathom...

43:49.059 --> 43:52.085
...you really believe all this stuff,
don't you?

43:53.797 --> 43:54.764
Can't you?

44:00.638 --> 44:02.071
I believe...

44:03.173 --> 44:04.606
...that you believe.

44:05.776 --> 44:09.974
Which, in some sense,
is the same as believing, I guess, isn't it?

44:16.553 --> 44:18.783
Do you understand what I've said?

44:20.457 --> 44:22.425
Do you have any questions?

44:26.163 --> 44:27.289
Adam?

44:30.267 --> 44:32.326
Sounds pretty bananas, Dad.

44:40.210 --> 44:41.438
Hello?

44:41.645 --> 44:42.634
Who?

44:43.514 --> 44:45.641
No, he isn't home right now.

44:47.618 --> 44:49.279
No, that's not him.

44:50.154 --> 44:52.714
Yes, you can print that in your paper.

44:52.823 --> 44:55.417
He is definitely not the man
in the <i>Times</i> today.

44:55.626 --> 44:58.117
-Can I go now, Dad?
-Sure, Son.

44:59.697 --> 45:01.164
I'll meet you.

45:01.965 --> 45:05.457
Look, I'm his wife. You can believe me.
Don't call back.

45:29.460 --> 45:33.396
-What do you think?
-Maybe he's going through a stage.

45:34.031 --> 45:35.862
You know, "mentalpause."

45:36.233 --> 45:37.860
That's "menopause."

45:38.068 --> 45:40.935
-Yeah, like Grandma.
-I hope.

45:43.741 --> 45:45.299
<i>And finally, this note.</i>

45:45.409 --> 45:49.402
<i>The</i> Los Angeles Sunday Times <i>reports</i>
<i>today that in Tarzana, California...</i>

45:49.513 --> 45:53.005
<i>...a supermarket manager, Jerry Landers,</i>
<i>had an alleged conversation...</i>

45:53.117 --> 45:55.176

45:55.285 --> 45:58.277
<i>According to the story,</i>

45:58.388 --> 46:01.824
<i>...that He lives and our world can work.</i>

46:03.393 --> 46:06.658
<i>This reporter would like to hedge his bets</i>
<i>on the outside chance...</i>

46:06.764 --> 46:11.167
<i>...that God did make this appearance</i>
<i>and that he just might be tuned to ABC.</i>

46:11.268 --> 46:13.566
<i>We'd like him to know, we did report it.</i>

46:13.670 --> 46:16.298
<i>This is Jerry Dunphy.</i>
<i>Thank you and good night.</i>

46:19.343 --> 46:24.076
-Even Moses didn't give his last name.
-That should get the phone ringing.

46:31.188 --> 46:32.177
I told you.

46:35.726 --> 46:36.920
Hello.

46:37.895 --> 46:41.262
Yes, this is Jerry Landers.
It's the <i>Tarzana Daily Review.</i>

46:42.232 --> 46:43.756
Yes, I'm the one.

46:44.434 --> 46:46.459
Spoke with him? Absolutely.

46:47.638 --> 46:50.300
About 6 foot, blondish hair....

46:51.975 --> 46:53.101
Oh, him.

46:54.344 --> 46:57.177
About 5' 7", I guess. Gray hair.

46:57.414 --> 46:59.746
-I almost forgot my project.
-Jerry.

46:59.850 --> 47:02.648
-I'm coming!
-You made the front page.

47:02.986 --> 47:04.146
What?

47:07.624 --> 47:09.683
-Everybody, look.
-What?

47:12.896 --> 47:15.831
Channel 11? That's the 10:00 news.

47:19.670 --> 47:23.606
-Can we stay up and watch us?
-Jerry, I don't want the kids on TV.

47:24.041 --> 47:26.407
Can't be any worse than watching it.

47:26.743 --> 47:29.211
Don't worry. Come on, kids.

47:30.247 --> 47:31.737
<i>Hold the cameras.</i>

47:34.451 --> 47:36.442
<i>-Mr. Landers?</i>
<i>-Yes.</i>

47:36.620 --> 47:38.485
<i>Channel 11, 10:00 news.</i>

47:38.856 --> 47:41.848
<i>You're quoted as saying</i>
<i>that you've talked with God, sir?</i>

47:41.992 --> 47:42.754
<i>Yes.</i>

47:42.893 --> 47:44.827
<i>-Face to face?</i>
<i>-That's right.</i>

47:44.928 --> 47:46.156
He's a fruitcake.

47:46.296 --> 47:50.756
<i>And you say God wants to affirm he's alive</i>
<i>and he's very disappointed...</i>

47:50.901 --> 47:54.803
<i>-...with the way we're handling our world?</i>
<i>-That's right.</i>

47:55.806 --> 47:58.673
<i>How are you going to get people</i>
<i>to believe you?</i>

47:58.809 --> 48:00.868
<i>It wasn't my idea.</i>

48:01.478 --> 48:03.446
<i>He picked me.</i>

48:03.981 --> 48:08.418
Is God going to reveal himself to you,
as you claim he has?

48:09.019 --> 48:11.579
Not as I claim he has. As he has.

48:12.756 --> 48:17.659
I don't know if he'll show up again,
but he gave me his message and--

48:17.828 --> 48:20.422
-Dad. It's 10 to.
-Yes, Adam.

48:21.698 --> 48:22.960
That he exists?

48:23.066 --> 48:26.968
Yes, and that he would like us
to cherish and nurture each other...

48:27.104 --> 48:30.164
<i>-...as opposed to killing one another.</i>
<i>-He said that?</i>

48:31.008 --> 48:35.206
<i>Yeah, that he's our shepherd,</i>
<i>and we shall not want.</i>

48:36.213 --> 48:39.148
<i>-We can quote you?</i>
<i>-I didn't make that up.</i>

48:41.218 --> 48:46.178
<i>For 10:00 news, this is Mario Machado</i>
<i>and the man who talked to God in Tarzana.</i>

48:48.158 --> 48:51.389
<i>The second time,</i>
<i>the first time was in Los Angeles.</i>

48:52.763 --> 48:53.457
<i>I stand corrected.</i>

48:55.899 --> 49:00.632
<i>Mr. Landers, please call</i>
<i>Mr. Summers at his office.</i>

49:01.171 --> 49:03.867
<i>Mr. Summers for Mr. Landers.</i>

49:14.985 --> 49:16.748
-Landers.
-Mr. Summers.

49:16.853 --> 49:18.411
Glad you could get here so fast.

49:18.522 --> 49:20.353
-Well, you said--
-Right, have a seat.

49:20.457 --> 49:21.389
Thank you.

49:21.491 --> 49:23.516
-How's it going, Landers?
-Fine.

49:23.627 --> 49:27.427
-You took over while Slavic is vacationing?
-Yes, sir.

49:28.065 --> 49:31.660
-Think you can handle a store as manager?
-I'm sure I can.

49:31.768 --> 49:33.030
Good.

49:33.603 --> 49:35.901
-Everything all right at home?
-Wonderful.

49:36.006 --> 49:38.907
The missus? Kids? Adam? Betsy?

49:39.009 --> 49:40.033
Becky.

49:40.143 --> 49:44.477
Good, what is this "seeing God" crap
all about?

49:45.649 --> 49:48.675
It's not crap, Mr. Summers. I've seen him.

49:50.520 --> 49:52.818
I've heard it all in this chair.

49:54.691 --> 49:56.818
I know what being a manager
can do to a man.

49:57.661 --> 49:58.787
Trouble with books.

49:59.629 --> 50:02.621
-Humping check-out girls in the freezer.
-I'm only the assistant.

50:02.733 --> 50:04.132
You can tell me.

50:04.234 --> 50:07.465
There's nothing like that to tell.
I really have seen him.

50:09.039 --> 50:13.976
Landers, the founder and
principal stockholder of Food World...

50:14.978 --> 50:17.173
...is a man devoted to prayer.

50:17.948 --> 50:21.782
Lowell Wilson has personally
gotten down on his knees...

50:22.686 --> 50:24.745
...with three US Presidents.

50:24.855 --> 50:28.621
He attended prayer breakfasts
and asked for God's blessing...

50:28.925 --> 50:33.123
...with the Joint Chiefs of Staff
right in the war room of the Pentagon.

50:34.765 --> 50:38.929
I don't think that Mr. Wilson
is going to take too kindly to the idea...

50:39.036 --> 50:41.266
...that one of his employees...

50:41.938 --> 50:45.999
...is claiming to have had a personal
audience with the Almighty himself.

50:46.209 --> 50:50.339
I should think that he would be very happy
to know that his prayers are heard.

50:50.447 --> 50:52.972
Mr. Wilson has reached
that point in his life...

50:53.083 --> 50:55.381
...where he can be sure
his prayers are heard.

50:55.485 --> 50:57.419
He doesn't need any help from you.

50:57.521 --> 51:00.581
It's not me. I'm just kind of like a Moses.

51:04.428 --> 51:06.020
Look, Landers.

51:07.130 --> 51:10.293
I don't want to pump any sunshine
up your skirt...

51:10.400 --> 51:14.302
...but you have a future at Food World.
Don't blow it.

51:15.272 --> 51:19.265
Now, you just keep your mouth shut,
and stay away from reporters.

51:22.279 --> 51:23.644
And if I don't?

51:25.482 --> 51:28.645
God may have been interested in you
as an assistant manager...

51:28.752 --> 51:32.415
...we'll just see how he feels
about you as a bag stuffer.

51:36.693 --> 51:37.955
Over here!

51:38.728 --> 51:41.288
I thought I'd straighten up a little.

51:42.432 --> 51:44.161
The mess people make.

51:45.268 --> 51:46.394
Take a seat.

51:48.505 --> 51:49.938
It's started?

51:50.874 --> 51:53.672
You said you saw me,
and the pressure started.

51:53.777 --> 51:56.974
-Is it going to get any worse?
-How should I know?

51:58.315 --> 52:00.215
What do you mean,
how should you know?

52:00.317 --> 52:02.785
-How could I know?
-You know everything.

52:03.954 --> 52:05.444
I only know what is.

52:05.589 --> 52:10.117
Also, I'm very big on what was.
On what isn't yet, I haven't got a clue.

52:10.861 --> 52:12.886
-But when you said--
-Move your foot.

52:13.029 --> 52:14.223
Sit down.

52:14.798 --> 52:16.925
When you said
everything would work out...

52:17.067 --> 52:18.898
...I thought you could tell the future.

52:19.002 --> 52:22.870
Absolutely, I could tell the future,
the minute it becomes the past.

52:22.973 --> 52:26.807
I said, everything could work out,
if that's everybody's choice.

52:27.043 --> 52:30.012
People have to decide
what's to be done with the world.

52:30.147 --> 52:33.173
I can't make a personal decision
for everybody.

52:34.284 --> 52:36.479
Why the face? So far, so good.

52:36.586 --> 52:39.885
We hit the papers, a little TV,
we're in business.

52:40.790 --> 52:42.724
I'm liable to lose my job.

52:43.693 --> 52:47.925
Lose a job, save a world. Not a bad deal.

52:53.803 --> 52:55.168
Hey, Adam.

53:03.947 --> 53:07.178
-What are you doing here?
-I got off early from work, Son.

53:07.284 --> 53:09.479
I thought I'd give you a lift home.

53:09.586 --> 53:11.554
No thanks, Dad. I'll walk.

53:12.656 --> 53:15.887
-Come on.
-No, I got new tennis shoes on.

53:16.426 --> 53:18.223
I want to break them in.

53:19.262 --> 53:20.786
See you later.

53:22.499 --> 53:24.262
Come on, let's go.

53:43.386 --> 53:45.115
<i>Why wouldn't they be embarrassed?</i>

53:45.589 --> 53:49.286
-Their friends ribbed the hell out of them.
-That's rotten.

53:49.759 --> 53:53.354
They wanted to know if you could
get their test answers from God.

53:53.463 --> 53:56.455
And could he do anything
about their little-league team?

53:56.566 --> 53:59.000
They gave them a very rough day.

53:59.102 --> 54:02.128
Jerry, what are you going to do
about Mr. Summers?

54:02.739 --> 54:05.071
What can I do?
What do you want me to do?

54:05.742 --> 54:09.234
I want you to say no more about it,
like he said not to.

54:10.513 --> 54:14.176
Bobbie,
Mr. Summers represents Food World.

54:14.618 --> 54:18.554
God is with "World World."
It's a slightly bigger obligation.

54:19.155 --> 54:22.591
-Bigger than your job?
-I have no choice.

54:22.993 --> 54:24.517
That's the problem.

54:24.628 --> 54:26.493
The problem is, you do!

54:27.163 --> 54:30.496
How far do you intend to take this?
How long is this going to go on?

54:30.600 --> 54:35.560
Until everyone gets the message.
Until I can convince people of this miracle.

54:36.172 --> 54:37.571
I mean, that's what it is.

54:37.674 --> 54:39.505
It's a miracle, nothing less.

54:39.609 --> 54:43.170
I have to reach the greatest number
of people possible and tell them.

54:43.280 --> 54:46.477
It's for you.
The producer of <i>The Dinah Shore Show.</i>

54:47.183 --> 54:51.381
You've been on television a long....
Not that long. I'm sorry.

54:51.488 --> 54:53.854
No, I'm much younger than I look.

54:54.557 --> 54:57.355
-No, I didn't want to say it that way.
-You look....

54:57.460 --> 55:01.021
I'm younger than people think I am,
because I've been around a long time.

55:01.131 --> 55:03.565
Everything you've done
has had such tremendous impact.

55:03.667 --> 55:06.693
<i>It's been magnificent.</i>
<i>I've never done anything bad in my life.</i>

55:06.803 --> 55:08.168
<i>I'm one of the perfect people.</i>

55:08.271 --> 55:10.205
<i>-That's kind of exciting.</i>
<i>-It is.</i>

55:10.307 --> 55:12.502
<i>Do you remember your first moment</i>
<i>on television?</i>

55:12.609 --> 55:17.546
<i>Actually, I do. It was in 1948.</i>
<i>It was Maggie McNellis's Crystal Room.</i>

55:17.647 --> 55:19.774
<i>We were told to be visual in those days.</i>

55:19.883 --> 55:22.249
The Picture of Dorian Grey
<i>was very popular then.</i>

55:22.352 --> 55:25.651
<i>I gave a 15-second impression</i>
<i>of</i> The Picture of Dorian Grey.

55:25.755 --> 55:27.916
<i>About the man who carouses.</i>

55:28.191 --> 55:30.625
<i>He stays looking good,</i>
<i>but his picture falls apart.</i>

55:44.607 --> 55:46.802
-Ready, Mr. Landers?
-Right.

55:48.244 --> 55:50.109
<i>I think I broke a jaw.</i>

55:53.917 --> 55:56.044
America is not ready for this.

55:58.321 --> 56:01.313
Okay, you'll take the empty seat
next to Dinah.

56:01.725 --> 56:05.821
-This show is taped, isn't it?
-Yes, it'll be on a week from today.

56:06.329 --> 56:10.629
You may have read about my next guest
in the newspapers recently.

56:10.967 --> 56:15.028
He is a supermarket manager
from Tarzana, California...

56:15.372 --> 56:19.331
...who says that he has been instructed
by God to spread the message...

56:19.476 --> 56:22.445
...that God lives and God cares.

56:23.146 --> 56:25.478
Please welcome Mr. Jerry Landers.

56:29.119 --> 56:32.020
-Am I on?
-Almost, that applause is for you.

56:34.624 --> 56:37.320
-Is Dinah nice, Daddy?
-Not now, honey.

56:38.027 --> 56:40.393
<i>-You're not nervous, are you?</i>
<i>-No.</i>

56:42.365 --> 56:46.563
<i>I don't mind telling you, I am.</i>
<i>You have some pretty powerful friend.</i>

56:48.905 --> 56:51.271
-Why are they laughing?
-Just watch.

56:51.841 --> 56:53.832
Because God is Daddy's friend.

56:55.111 --> 56:59.707
<i>-Why do you suppose he picked you, Jerry?</i>
<i>-God only knows. I mean....</i>

57:01.918 --> 57:03.146
<i>You're right.</i>

57:03.253 --> 57:07.883
<i>You said that God wants us to know</i>
<i>that he still cares.</i>

57:08.291 --> 57:11.089
<i>Is there anything else</i>
<i>that he wants us to know?</i>

57:11.194 --> 57:14.857
<i>Yes, that he's given us everything</i>
<i>that we need to make our life work...</i>

57:14.964 --> 57:17.262
<i>...make the world work,</i>
<i>and that he's watching us.</i>

57:17.367 --> 57:19.335
<i>-He's watching?</i>
<i>-Yes.</i>

57:19.436 --> 57:20.835
<i>Watching us?</i>

57:21.771 --> 57:23.136
<i>-Now?</i>
<i>-Yes.</i>

57:28.611 --> 57:32.638
<i>You agreed earlier</i>
<i>to be part of an experiment today...</i>

57:33.216 --> 57:35.582
<i>...with the Los Angeles Police Department.</i>

57:35.685 --> 57:37.710
<i>Do you want me</i>
<i>to take a lie detector test?</i>

57:37.821 --> 57:39.516
<i>-No.</i>
<i>-I will.</i>

57:40.423 --> 57:44.723
<i>What this is, is a sketch artist</i>
<i>from the Los Angeles Police Department.</i>

57:45.061 --> 57:49.555
<i>He's an expert and very adept</i>
<i>at making a sketch from a description.</i>

57:49.666 --> 57:53.659
<i>I think all of us here would like to know</i>
<i>what God looks like.</i>

57:53.770 --> 57:55.294
<i>You would like to know.</i>

57:59.609 --> 58:00.837
<i>-Shall we?</i>
<i>-Okay.</i>

58:00.944 --> 58:02.343
<i>Follow me.</i>

58:03.313 --> 58:06.908
<i>-Jerry, this is Mr. Fernando Ponce.</i>
<i>-Hello, sir.</i>

58:07.016 --> 58:08.745
<i>-Please sit there.</i>
<i>-Thank you.</i>

58:09.185 --> 58:14.054
<i>Mr. Ponce, as I said, is an expert</i>
<i>at eyewitness sketches...</i>

58:14.290 --> 58:16.258
<i>...for the LA Police Department.</i>

58:18.728 --> 58:21.492
<i>-How do I start?</i>
<i>-Tell me about the shape of his face.</i>

58:21.965 --> 58:23.626
<i>The shape is...</i>

58:25.335 --> 58:26.825
<i>...triangular.</i>

58:27.303 --> 58:28.395
<i>-Good.</i>
<i>-I guess.</i>

58:29.772 --> 58:33.299
<i>-He's got large ears.</i>
<i>-He has?</i>

58:33.409 --> 58:36.173
Jerry, I don't believe you actually did this.

58:36.279 --> 58:37.746
It was their idea.

58:37.881 --> 58:39.974
<i>He does. He wears glasses.</i>

58:41.150 --> 58:42.777
<i>God wears glasses?</i>

58:45.288 --> 58:47.313
<i>He's wearing a fishing cap.</i>

58:48.057 --> 58:50.992
<i>-A fishing cap?</i>
<i>-Maybe it's like a baseball cap.</i>

58:51.160 --> 58:54.220
<i>His lips are kind of thin.</i>
<i>His nose is straight.</i>

58:55.865 --> 58:57.696
<i>It's round on the ends.</i>

58:57.800 --> 58:59.825
No one's supposed to know
what God looks like.

58:59.936 --> 59:01.460
-I do.
-You do?

59:01.938 --> 59:05.430
Yeah. In <i>Bible Comics,</i>
they had a picture of him last week.

59:06.042 --> 59:10.502
<i>They're horn-rimmed glasses.</i>
<i>They're plastic ones, you know?</i>

59:10.613 --> 59:13.741
<i>Where would you suppose</i>
<i>he would get his glasses?</i>

59:15.852 --> 59:17.342
<i>I don't know.</i>

59:19.155 --> 59:21.180
<i>-Anywhere he likes.</i>
<i>-Yeah.</i>

59:23.293 --> 59:26.626
Boy, I sure hope my friends are
doing their homework.

59:27.263 --> 59:30.426
<i>This is what God looked like to you?</i>

59:31.501 --> 59:34.026
<i>He's sort of captured the sense...</i>

59:35.104 --> 59:36.264
<i>...I guess.</i>

59:37.140 --> 59:39.700
<i>America, here it is...</i>

59:40.176 --> 59:43.907
<i>...as seen through the eyes</i>
<i>of Jerry Landers.</i>

59:44.013 --> 59:45.037
<i>God.</i>

59:57.393 --> 59:59.861
Dad, you're going to get God arrested.

01:00:02.465 --> 01:00:06.595
-You said it would be done by 6:00.
-I'm sorry, but I just got the part.

01:00:09.772 --> 01:00:12.764
-Weren't you on the <i>Dinah Show</i> last night?
-Yeah.

01:00:13.610 --> 01:00:16.306
Yeah, that was real different.

01:00:17.847 --> 01:00:18.973
Excuse me.

01:00:19.215 --> 01:00:21.376
How am I supposed to get home now?

01:00:21.751 --> 01:00:22.877
Where to, mister?

01:00:28.324 --> 01:00:29.484
Get in.

01:00:42.105 --> 01:00:44.130
I hope you have a license.

01:00:51.948 --> 01:00:55.611
-Did you watch <i>Dinah Shore</i> last night?
-I watch everything.

01:00:56.586 --> 01:00:59.714
I got you national exposure.
I hope you're happy.

01:01:00.523 --> 01:01:02.218
I could be happier.

01:01:03.192 --> 01:01:04.216
How?

01:01:04.360 --> 01:01:06.089
For starters, you do a show like that...

01:01:06.195 --> 01:01:08.663
...you don't let them put you on
the last few minutes.

01:01:08.798 --> 01:01:10.766
That's for fellas who write diet books.

01:01:10.900 --> 01:01:12.595
It wasn't up to me.

01:01:13.436 --> 01:01:15.267
And what was that drawing thing?

01:01:15.371 --> 01:01:18.204
-He was a police artist.
-Man draws crooks.

01:01:18.941 --> 01:01:23.503
Makes everybody look like a crook.
Made me look like a second-story man.

01:01:24.213 --> 01:01:27.842
-It's publicity.
-I'm used to a little better treatment.

01:01:28.551 --> 01:01:32.920
That painting of me by Michelangelo,
that's a picture.

01:01:33.923 --> 01:01:35.891
And he did it laying flat on his back.

01:01:36.893 --> 01:01:38.087
Now what happens?

01:01:38.194 --> 01:01:42.756
Now we see who can still believe,
who wants to, who needs to.

01:01:43.433 --> 01:01:45.924
A few million people
saw you last night, right?

01:01:46.035 --> 01:01:48.401
A few million?
Some of them will believe you.

01:01:48.504 --> 01:01:51.166
Some are going to want to
punch me in the head.

01:01:51.274 --> 01:01:53.174
Some will want to fire me.

01:01:53.276 --> 01:01:55.574
Some may decide
I'm too crazy to live with.

01:01:55.678 --> 01:01:58.738
We can't worry about those.
The ball is rolling.

01:01:58.981 --> 01:02:03.077
-Yeah, right over me.
-Don't be a malcontent, I'll watch over you.

01:02:03.186 --> 01:02:06.246
While you're watching over me,
would you mind watching the road?

01:02:06.355 --> 01:02:08.050
I'd rather watch a nice sunset.

01:02:21.771 --> 01:02:24.501
<i>Dinah Shore</i> must get a pretty big rating.

01:02:31.214 --> 01:02:32.806
You're on, kid.

01:02:44.393 --> 01:02:46.588
-Jerry?
-Yes, God?

01:02:46.829 --> 01:02:49.798
You have the strength
that comes from knowing.

01:03:16.959 --> 01:03:20.395
Can I have one minute with you?
I have something very important to say.

01:03:20.496 --> 01:03:21.724
It just can't wait.

01:03:21.831 --> 01:03:24.265
Please, bless my baby.

01:03:25.401 --> 01:03:28.461
Touch him, pray for him. Pray for my baby.

01:03:28.571 --> 01:03:31.335
If I could just have one second with you....

01:03:32.475 --> 01:03:34.943
-It's not for me, it's for you.
-Sanctify my body.

01:03:35.044 --> 01:03:37.171
Bless him, make him a true believer!

01:03:37.280 --> 01:03:39.942
I have something very important.
This is for you!

01:03:40.049 --> 01:03:42.517
-Give me your golden staff.
-I can't!

01:03:43.219 --> 01:03:47.155
-God said it's okay.
-I'll tell you this, it's very important!

01:03:47.323 --> 01:03:49.848
Officer, could you move
the rest of them along?

01:03:49.959 --> 01:03:51.187
Yes, sir.

01:03:52.361 --> 01:03:54.955
One little moment, please.
What I have to tell him is--

01:03:55.064 --> 01:03:55.962
Okay.

01:03:56.432 --> 01:03:59.401
I went to empty the garbage,
and two people blessed me.

01:03:59.502 --> 01:04:01.663
Then one of them blessed the garbage.

01:04:01.771 --> 01:04:05.298
And then he asked me if our children
were conceived immaculately.

01:04:05.408 --> 01:04:06.705
Now, calm down, honey.

01:04:06.809 --> 01:04:08.936
The police had to take our kids
to school today.

01:04:09.045 --> 01:04:11.570
-They said it was safer.
-That's awful!

01:04:11.814 --> 01:04:14.282
Yes, that's awful.
You want to hear awfuller?

01:04:14.383 --> 01:04:16.851
Mr. Summers said that Lowell Wilson...

01:04:16.986 --> 01:04:20.979
...is personally deciding
whether or not you can keep your job.

01:04:21.457 --> 01:04:23.049
Is that awful enough for you?

01:04:23.192 --> 01:04:25.217
Now, Bobbie, don't let it get to you.

01:04:25.361 --> 01:04:26.919
Don't let it get to me?

01:04:28.631 --> 01:04:31.225
Jerry, it's gotten to me! Don't you see?

01:04:32.034 --> 01:04:35.060
Jerry, look, you've got him to talk to.

01:04:35.204 --> 01:04:39.436
It's just me here,
me and those religious nuts outside!

01:04:40.309 --> 01:04:42.243
I have to leave the phone off the hook.

01:04:42.378 --> 01:04:45.575
People keep calling up
and asking to talk to God.

01:04:45.948 --> 01:04:49.941
Except, of course, for the guy
who offered to chew on my pantyhose!

01:04:51.821 --> 01:04:55.552
Telegrams, notes in the mail box
and the doorways.

01:04:56.192 --> 01:04:58.626
Today they even put one
in the dog's mouth.

01:04:58.728 --> 01:05:00.093
This is from the university.

01:05:00.196 --> 01:05:02.721
I've been invited to appear
before a theology group.

01:05:02.865 --> 01:05:05.629
<i>-They want to verify the miracle.</i>
<i>-Terrific.</i>

01:05:05.768 --> 01:05:09.932
<i>It is! This'll give me credibility,</i>
<i>and God'll get his word across.</i>

01:05:10.039 --> 01:05:11.529
<i>It'll help me keep my job.</i>

01:05:12.842 --> 01:05:16.039
Mr. Landers,
it is the consensus of this group...

01:05:16.846 --> 01:05:21.783
...that you are a person of
little or no theological knowledge.

01:05:22.718 --> 01:05:25.209
You have demonstrated, over the years...

01:05:25.354 --> 01:05:29.620
...an astonishing lack of interest
in spiritual matters.

01:05:30.893 --> 01:05:35.489
It strikes me,
as one who has actually heard his voice...

01:05:36.399 --> 01:05:41.336
...that you have virtually no prerequisites
to make direct contact...

01:05:41.470 --> 01:05:44.496
-...with the Almighty, whatsoever.
-You've heard him?

01:05:46.642 --> 01:05:48.906
He has made his word known to me.

01:05:49.011 --> 01:05:50.308
What was he wearing?

01:05:51.113 --> 01:05:53.411
I know his word through the scriptures.

01:05:53.516 --> 01:05:55.746
It would be blasphemy to suggest...

01:05:55.851 --> 01:05:58.718
...that we could describe the Creator
in human terms.

01:05:58.821 --> 01:05:59.913
Why?

01:06:00.022 --> 01:06:01.512
If He created us...

01:06:01.624 --> 01:06:06.391
...why wouldn't he appear to us
as one of us?

01:06:06.495 --> 01:06:07.462
Don't you....

01:06:15.171 --> 01:06:17.071
Don't you, young man...

01:06:17.707 --> 01:06:21.268
...try to teach this assemblage
the role of the Deity.

01:06:23.679 --> 01:06:26.944
Rabbi Silverstone,
my good and great friend...

01:06:27.049 --> 01:06:31.383
...brother in the work of the Lord, with
whom we have broke bread many times...

01:06:31.487 --> 01:06:34.217
...is a pillar of
the American Jew community.

01:06:35.825 --> 01:06:39.488
Bishop Reardon represents millions
of Roman Catholics.

01:06:40.329 --> 01:06:43.890
Bishop Marcos,
multitudes of Greek Orthodoxers.

01:06:44.700 --> 01:06:47.897
Why, we have virtually every
religious persuasion...

01:06:48.004 --> 01:06:49.528
...represented here today.

01:06:49.638 --> 01:06:52.505
And I personally have been chosen...

01:06:52.608 --> 01:06:55.702
...to render the benediction
at this year's Super Bowl.

01:06:58.381 --> 01:07:03.318
Mr. Landers, we really find
insufficient documentation...

01:07:03.986 --> 01:07:05.613
...to support your claim.

01:07:05.721 --> 01:07:07.655
But you're not saying it didn't happen.

01:07:07.757 --> 01:07:11.386
No, we are saying
there is insufficient documentation.

01:07:11.494 --> 01:07:15.954
Which puts the score at God 7, you 0.

01:07:17.433 --> 01:07:20.334
We have decided, however,
out of a sense of fairness...

01:07:20.436 --> 01:07:22.961
...and ecclesiastical curiosity...

01:07:23.339 --> 01:07:27.173
...to allow you to present us
with certain evidence.

01:07:27.943 --> 01:07:29.205
What evidence?

01:07:29.311 --> 01:07:32.041
We have assembled a set of questions...

01:07:33.215 --> 01:07:35.615
...for you to ask God.

01:07:36.619 --> 01:07:38.484
There are 50 questions.

01:07:40.056 --> 01:07:41.318
Fifty.

01:07:42.458 --> 01:07:44.949
You want me to get God to take a quiz?

01:07:45.061 --> 01:07:47.461
Unless you've been concealing
an abundant knowledge--

01:07:47.563 --> 01:07:49.656
Which I find highly doubtful.

01:07:49.765 --> 01:07:53.531
There are questions there
that you could not possibly answer.

01:07:55.371 --> 01:07:58.238
Look, I don't know when...

01:07:58.674 --> 01:08:00.642
...or if he'll ever appear again.

01:08:00.743 --> 01:08:05.237
As a control measure, you will remain
locked in your hotel room...

01:08:05.648 --> 01:08:07.081
...alone.

01:08:08.717 --> 01:08:10.582
-Not even my wife?
-No.

01:08:10.686 --> 01:08:13.177
There'll be no outside calls, whatsoever.

01:08:15.091 --> 01:08:16.991
You could, of course, decline.

01:08:17.093 --> 01:08:20.256
But then,
that would form the basis of our report.

01:08:30.305 --> 01:08:31.398
God?

01:08:49.091 --> 01:08:51.024
-God?
-Room service.

01:08:58.701 --> 01:09:00.828
Just put it right around over here, please.

01:09:03.439 --> 01:09:05.872
You can't come in. I understand.

01:09:06.809 --> 01:09:08.674
Do I need to sign this?

01:09:11.613 --> 01:09:13.411
Thank you very much.

01:09:27.563 --> 01:09:30.292
-They forgot the ketchup.
-Come in!

01:09:31.133 --> 01:09:33.100
They're playing our number.

01:09:42.912 --> 01:09:46.143
$11 for a steak? Who would have thought?

01:09:46.381 --> 01:09:50.408
With me, cows were an afterthought.
Just to give new mothers a little rest.

01:09:52.520 --> 01:09:55.615
-Boy, am I glad to see you.
-Eat. It'll get cold.

01:10:01.363 --> 01:10:02.455
Pretty cute.

01:10:03.065 --> 01:10:06.034
-What is it?
-They made sure you couldn't answer.

01:10:06.135 --> 01:10:08.695
The questions are in the ancient tongue
of Aramaic.

01:10:08.804 --> 01:10:10.499
Is that what that is?

01:10:11.040 --> 01:10:15.568
They've figured out so many ways to talk
to each other, they're finding nobody can.

01:10:16.212 --> 01:10:20.080
Let's see.
"What's the true origin of the universe?

01:10:21.317 --> 01:10:26.277
"What is the source of the planet Earth?"
It's a History final, right?

01:10:31.093 --> 01:10:32.651
So many repeats.

01:10:33.729 --> 01:10:35.492
Eat the steak, and then get a pen.

01:10:39.902 --> 01:10:42.871
"Did man fall from grace
in the Garden of Eden?"

01:10:44.240 --> 01:10:48.142
I'll tell you something, never came out.
I made Adam 17.

01:10:48.377 --> 01:10:50.845
Eve was 15, 16, tops.

01:10:51.247 --> 01:10:54.307
I figured then,
16, 17 was middle-age, you know.

01:10:54.416 --> 01:10:58.910
Who knew people would live so long?
Trees, I figured they had the best chance.

01:10:59.021 --> 01:11:01.819
Now I realize that they were kids, babies.

01:11:01.957 --> 01:11:06.223
Young people can't fall from my grace.
They're my best things. Put that down.

01:11:10.432 --> 01:11:12.525
-"Which of the world's--"
-Wait.

01:11:14.069 --> 01:11:15.036
Okay.

01:11:15.137 --> 01:11:19.164
"Which of the world's religions is
the closest to the divine truth?"

01:11:20.075 --> 01:11:23.738
The divine truth is not in a building
or a book or a story.

01:11:24.880 --> 01:11:28.816
Put down that the heart is the temple
wherein all truth resides.

01:11:32.154 --> 01:11:34.554
"Is Jesus Christ the son of God?"

01:11:41.563 --> 01:11:42.825
Jesus was my son.

01:11:44.900 --> 01:11:46.390
Buddha was my son.

01:11:46.969 --> 01:11:49.563
Mohammed, Moses, you...

01:11:49.738 --> 01:11:53.105
...the man who said there was
no room in the inn was my son.

01:11:53.208 --> 01:11:56.371
So is the one who charges $11 for steak
in this one.

01:11:56.478 --> 01:11:57.877
Let's mush on.

01:11:58.414 --> 01:12:00.507
What was that last question?

01:12:03.185 --> 01:12:06.518
-"Will there--"
-"Will there be a judgment day for man?"

01:12:08.324 --> 01:12:11.691
If they mean a doomsday,
an end-of-the-world thing...

01:12:11.794 --> 01:12:13.921
...I'm certainly not going to get into that.

01:12:14.029 --> 01:12:17.726
But if you want my personal opinion,
I wouldn't look forward to it.

01:12:17.833 --> 01:12:21.269
There'd be a lot of yelling,
and I don't need that anymore than you do.

01:12:21.370 --> 01:12:22.564
Got that?

01:12:23.439 --> 01:12:24.565
Got it.

01:12:25.240 --> 01:12:28.175
"What is the meaning of man's existence?"

01:12:30.813 --> 01:12:32.678
Life is like a glass of tea.

01:12:33.882 --> 01:12:38.785
No, I better not go for laughs.
Voltaire may have had me pegged, right?

01:12:39.455 --> 01:12:43.585
He said I was a comedian playing
to an audience who's afraid to laugh.

01:12:43.826 --> 01:12:47.284
But seriously,
put down that man and women-persons...

01:12:48.130 --> 01:12:51.361
...their existence means
exactly and precisely...

01:12:51.500 --> 01:12:54.901
...not more, not one tiny bit less,
just what they think it means.

01:12:55.037 --> 01:12:57.437
What I think doesn't count at all.

01:12:58.307 --> 01:13:01.242
-That's very profound.
-Sometimes I get lucky.

01:13:04.146 --> 01:13:06.307
-Last question.
-Thank God.

01:13:06.448 --> 01:13:07.813
You're welcome.

01:13:09.118 --> 01:13:11.951
"Why have you chosen
to appear at this time?"

01:13:12.454 --> 01:13:13.887
You've already said.

01:13:13.989 --> 01:13:16.082
Maybe they want to hear it
in your own words.

01:13:17.793 --> 01:13:21.695
I want to say to everyone that everything
around them that they see and smell...

01:13:21.830 --> 01:13:24.560
...and feel and hear,
they should delight in all this.

01:13:24.700 --> 01:13:27.635
That what is here are
some of my very best ideas.

01:13:27.770 --> 01:13:29.397
I want everyone to try very hard...

01:13:29.538 --> 01:13:31.972
...to make sure
it doesn't all go down the drain.

01:13:33.075 --> 01:13:35.168
Give me, I'll do it.

01:13:38.347 --> 01:13:41.748
Can you remember exactly what you said?
It was perfect.

01:13:44.486 --> 01:13:47.455
Boy, these answers are
really going to get them.

01:13:49.291 --> 01:13:50.815
That's my handwriting!

01:13:51.593 --> 01:13:53.026
lmagine that.

01:13:54.463 --> 01:13:56.556
Shall I call the panel
and tell them I'm ready?

01:13:56.665 --> 01:13:59.930
Never mind the panel.
You deliver those papers to Rev. Williams...

01:14:00.035 --> 01:14:03.198
-...the one who looks like a football player.
-I didn't like him.

01:14:03.305 --> 01:14:06.365
He's having one of his big dos
at the Shrine Auditorium.

01:14:06.475 --> 01:14:10.002
Every time I turn around,
he's spreading the word, my word.

01:14:10.112 --> 01:14:13.980
Only, my words he ran out of years ago.
I'll tell you the truth.

01:14:15.017 --> 01:14:16.917
The reason I put everybody here naked...

01:14:17.019 --> 01:14:21.183
...I wasn't trying to be cute,
I just didn't want to create clothes.

01:14:21.290 --> 01:14:25.522
With clothes, there's right away pockets,
and you have to put something in them.

01:14:25.627 --> 01:14:27.857
You take these,
and give them to Rev. Bigmouth.

01:14:27.963 --> 01:14:30.454
Tell him that God says he's a phony.

01:14:30.766 --> 01:14:34.497
Also, tell him if he wants to get rich, fine.
Tell him to sell Earth Shoes.

01:14:34.603 --> 01:14:38.437
But personally tell him
I'd like him to shut up. I'll see you.

01:14:42.644 --> 01:14:43.736
God?

01:14:45.447 --> 01:14:46.539
Yeah?

01:14:47.349 --> 01:14:50.182
-Thank you.
-Hope I get an "A."

01:14:54.990 --> 01:14:56.184
<i>Love.</i>

01:14:57.192 --> 01:14:59.183
<i>Let's talk about love.</i>

01:15:00.429 --> 01:15:01.555
<i>What is it?</i>

01:15:02.064 --> 01:15:04.760
<i>You can love your brother, can't you?</i>

01:15:05.133 --> 01:15:08.068
<i>You can love your wife or your husband.</i>

01:15:09.771 --> 01:15:11.830
<i>You can love your new dress.</i>

01:15:12.407 --> 01:15:14.341
<i>You can love my new car.</i>

01:15:16.345 --> 01:15:18.540
<i>You can pass by a pet shop...</i>

01:15:19.014 --> 01:15:22.506
<i>...and say, "I just love</i>
<i>that little doggie in the window."</i>

01:15:23.852 --> 01:15:26.582
<i>You can love this, and you can love that.</i>

01:15:27.356 --> 01:15:29.517
<i>But what am I talking about?</i>

01:15:30.659 --> 01:15:32.456
<i>Some folks say...</i>

01:15:32.561 --> 01:15:36.190
<i>...that love is what they saw</i>
<i>in a pornographic movie.</i>

01:15:37.332 --> 01:15:40.130
<i>But that is lust, not love.</i>

01:15:42.271 --> 01:15:45.138
<i>-Is that what you want?</i>
-No!

01:15:45.674 --> 01:15:47.938
<i>-Is that love?</i>
-No!

01:15:48.043 --> 01:15:50.978
<i>-Is that what the Bible teaches?</i>
-No!

01:15:51.079 --> 01:15:53.604
<i>-Is that what I'm talking about?</i>
-No!

01:15:53.749 --> 01:15:57.412
<i>No, because what I'm talking about</i>
<i>is the kind of love...</i>

01:15:57.519 --> 01:16:00.044
<i>...that calls for a sacrifice.</i>

01:16:01.723 --> 01:16:04.317
<i>Are you willing to make a sacrifice...</i>

01:16:04.426 --> 01:16:07.122
<i>...to show God how much you love him?</i>

01:16:07.229 --> 01:16:08.321
Yes!

01:16:08.430 --> 01:16:12.764
<i>To show God how you love him</i>
<i>with all of your heart and soul?</i>

01:16:13.335 --> 01:16:14.302
Yes!

01:16:14.903 --> 01:16:17.633
<i>-How do we love God? With all our....</i>
-Hearts!

01:16:17.739 --> 01:16:20.572
<i>-How do we love God? With all our....</i>
-Souls!

01:16:20.676 --> 01:16:23.406
<i>-Is that what I'm talking about?</i>
-Yes!

01:16:24.613 --> 01:16:26.581
<i>Yes, amen, I say, yes!</i>

01:16:26.682 --> 01:16:29.776
<i>-Raise your right hand, and say amen!</i>
-Amen!

01:16:29.885 --> 01:16:31.409
<i>-Say amen!</i>
-Amen!

01:16:39.528 --> 01:16:42.656
<i>And you can show God how you love him...</i>

01:16:44.299 --> 01:16:46.290
<i>...by digging down deep...</i>

01:16:48.036 --> 01:16:52.996
<i>...so that this ministry will reach</i>
<i>all of the people of the earth!</i>

01:16:53.475 --> 01:16:55.602
<i>Because the Bible tells us:</i>

01:16:55.711 --> 01:16:59.545
<i>"Show God you love him,</i>
<i>and he will show you the way."</i>

01:17:00.048 --> 01:17:01.276
Amen!

01:17:01.950 --> 01:17:04.680
<i>Now, I'm going to ask all of you</i>
<i>to come up.</i>

01:17:05.120 --> 01:17:07.054
<i>Those of you who haven't come up before...</i>

01:17:07.189 --> 01:17:10.090
<i>...I'm going to ask you to come up for God.</i>

01:17:10.926 --> 01:17:15.488
<i>Shake my hand,</i>
<i>and let God see us together.</i>

01:17:16.732 --> 01:17:19.360
<i>Because the Bible tells us...</i>

01:17:19.501 --> 01:17:22.868
<i>...that God knows the falling of a sparrow...</i>

01:17:23.538 --> 01:17:28.475
<i>...and the depth of a pocket,</i>
<i>and that is what I'm talking about!</i>

01:17:28.744 --> 01:17:29.870
Amen!

01:17:31.113 --> 01:17:34.276
<i>Come up, brothers and sisters...</i>

01:17:34.616 --> 01:17:39.315
<i>...and put in our hands</i>
<i>what you would put in God's hands...</i>

01:17:39.554 --> 01:17:44.150
<i>...and he will have the whole world</i>
<i>in his hands!</i>

01:17:45.961 --> 01:17:50.455
"He's got the whole world in his hands

01:17:50.599 --> 01:17:54.592
"He's got the whole world in his hands

01:17:54.736 --> 01:17:58.638
"He's got the whole world in his hands

01:17:58.774 --> 01:18:00.537
"He's got the whole world..."

01:18:00.642 --> 01:18:03.270
May the Lord bless and keep you.
It's so good to see you.

01:18:03.378 --> 01:18:04.367
You can put that right--

01:18:04.513 --> 01:18:06.947
Yes, thank you very much. God bless you.

01:18:08.650 --> 01:18:12.051
May the Lord always bless you
and keep you. It's so good to see you.

01:18:12.154 --> 01:18:13.746
Thank you, please keep moving.

01:18:14.856 --> 01:18:16.790
-Rev. Williams.
-That's all right.

01:18:16.925 --> 01:18:18.916
He is in need of me.
What are you doing here?

01:18:19.027 --> 01:18:21.757
-God sent me to you.
-One moment!

01:18:23.899 --> 01:18:27.494
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>brothers and sisters...</i>

01:18:28.070 --> 01:18:32.336
<i>...this is the young man</i>
<i>who has used so much energy...</i>

01:18:32.441 --> 01:18:36.400
<i>...to convince everyone</i>
<i>that he has seen God.</i>

01:18:38.246 --> 01:18:39.270
<i>Now, wait!</i>

01:18:41.483 --> 01:18:43.747
<i>Would you repeat</i>
<i>what you just said to me?</i>

01:18:45.454 --> 01:18:46.682
<i>God sent me to you.</i>

01:18:47.255 --> 01:18:50.656
<i>God sent him to me!</i>

01:18:51.960 --> 01:18:55.020
<i>-Are you certain of that?</i>
<i>-Yes, I just left him.</i>

01:18:56.331 --> 01:19:00.290
<i>He wanted me to give you these answers</i>
<i>to all of those questions.</i>

01:19:00.402 --> 01:19:02.461
<i>-God specified me?</i>
<i>-Yes.</i>

01:19:02.804 --> 01:19:05.932
<i>And he also asked me to tell you</i>
<i>that he's very unhappy.</i>

01:19:06.041 --> 01:19:08.737
<i>God is very unhappy.</i>

01:19:08.844 --> 01:19:13.304
<i>Yes, he's unhappy that you're</i>
<i>getting rich this way.</i>

01:19:13.415 --> 01:19:17.374
<i>And that he'd like you to stop pretending</i>
<i>that you're spreading his word.</i>

01:19:17.686 --> 01:19:20.120
<i>In fact, he suggested that you sell shoes.</i>

01:19:21.456 --> 01:19:23.651
That's what he said! You're a fake!

01:19:24.693 --> 01:19:26.684
<i>This poor boy is ill.</i>

01:19:26.862 --> 01:19:28.090
Get him out of here!

01:19:31.166 --> 01:19:32.793
Rev. Williams!

01:19:34.870 --> 01:19:38.897
Slander, Your Honor.
Slander, surely, cruel and foul.

01:19:40.075 --> 01:19:43.442
The Rev. Willie Williams is
on the road for God...

01:19:43.545 --> 01:19:46.036
...to the tune of 100,000 miles a year.

01:19:46.581 --> 01:19:49.641
He's a tireless, selfless servant of the Lord.

01:19:50.619 --> 01:19:55.579
The idea that he'd line his pockets
in this pursuit is the unkindest cut of all.

01:19:56.892 --> 01:19:59.793
Not only is Willie Williams'
organization nonprofit...

01:19:59.895 --> 01:20:04.559
...he personally pays over six figures
in income tax every year.

01:20:04.966 --> 01:20:07.457
Give him back his honor, Your Honor.

01:20:08.303 --> 01:20:12.740
Award him the damages we seek
from this defendant.

01:20:14.409 --> 01:20:16.468
A man so out of touch with reality...

01:20:16.578 --> 01:20:20.412
...he even tries to smear the good name
of a religious giant.

01:20:20.849 --> 01:20:24.683
A man whom the President of
the United States once called...

01:20:24.786 --> 01:20:26.981
..."God's own quarterback."

01:20:29.224 --> 01:20:30.953
Thank you, Your Honor.

01:20:34.429 --> 01:20:37.489
Mr. Landers, will you come
to the bench, please?

01:20:42.938 --> 01:20:45.532
-You haven't changed your mind?
-No, sir.

01:20:45.874 --> 01:20:50.504
A professional lawyer would be helpful.
This is a tough time for you to be alone.

01:20:52.113 --> 01:20:54.547
I won't be alone, sir.

01:21:01.289 --> 01:21:04.520
-They're just going to kill you today, Jerry.
-We'll see.

01:21:05.060 --> 01:21:08.029
We're going to lose everything
you worked for.

01:21:09.998 --> 01:21:12.330
Isn't there any way
you can say you're sorry?

01:21:12.434 --> 01:21:14.163
That it was all a big mistake?

01:21:14.769 --> 01:21:18.034
No, because I'm not, and it wasn't.

01:21:18.940 --> 01:21:21.534
I just can't believe
that God would set me up...

01:21:21.676 --> 01:21:24.008
<i>...to get me into all of this trouble.</i>

01:21:24.145 --> 01:21:26.807
<i>I have to believe that he had a reason...</i>

01:21:26.948 --> 01:21:30.850
<i>...and I have to believe</i>
<i>that he'll bail me out.</i>

01:21:31.253 --> 01:21:35.485
<i>And all I want to say is,</i>
<i>that young man is out of his mind.</i>

01:21:36.458 --> 01:21:41.122
And the absolute being, the all-powerful,
all-knowing, all-merciful...

01:21:41.263 --> 01:21:44.357
...infinite spirit, the supreme soul...

01:21:44.499 --> 01:21:46.899
...the King of Kings, and Lord of Lords...

01:21:47.569 --> 01:21:50.629
...the infinite, everlasting eternal being...

01:21:51.273 --> 01:21:54.299
...last came to you how?

01:21:56.411 --> 01:21:57.742
As a busboy.

01:22:04.452 --> 01:22:06.682
Your Honor, I rest my case.

01:22:11.626 --> 01:22:13.856
You may step down now, Mr. Landers.

01:22:22.237 --> 01:22:25.001
Call your witnesses, please, Mr. Landers.

01:22:25.240 --> 01:22:29.142
Yes, Your Honor, I would like to call
one witness and one witness only.

01:22:38.119 --> 01:22:39.814
I'm waiting, Mr. Landers.

01:22:41.256 --> 01:22:42.280
Yes.

01:22:44.659 --> 01:22:49.062
Your Honor, I would like to call
to the stand the Lord God.

01:22:53.234 --> 01:22:57.102
I object. The defendant's trying
to make a mockery of this proceeding.

01:22:57.372 --> 01:22:59.431
Your Honor, I was trying to make a point.

01:22:59.541 --> 01:23:01.406
-What point?
-Your Honor...

01:23:04.746 --> 01:23:07.738
...when I just asked God
to take the stand...

01:23:08.450 --> 01:23:13.183
...in that brief moment after I called him,
wasn't there a trace of expectation?

01:23:13.421 --> 01:23:15.252
Just a trace, Your Honor?

01:23:16.725 --> 01:23:20.388
Wasn't there a hesitation in this room?
Didn't you feel it?

01:23:23.198 --> 01:23:24.995
Didn't we all feel it?

01:23:26.601 --> 01:23:29.764
It was the possibility that God does exist.

01:23:30.071 --> 01:23:34.269
And if he exists, he could materialize
and sit right in that chair.

01:23:35.276 --> 01:23:38.712
In that moment, Your Honor,
when no one in this room knew...

01:23:38.813 --> 01:23:42.305
...what was going to happen next,
in that flash of an instant...

01:23:42.717 --> 01:23:47.154
...lies the benefit of the doubt you must
give me to know that my story is true.

01:23:47.255 --> 01:23:49.883
And that I spoke exactly as God asked me.

01:23:51.493 --> 01:23:56.430
Mr. Landers, I cautioned you earlier
that legal representation would be helpful.

01:23:57.198 --> 01:24:00.395
I must now warn you that,
in addition to the plaintiff's charges...

01:24:00.502 --> 01:24:03.027
...I'm seriously considering
citing you with contempt.

01:24:03.138 --> 01:24:04.105
Amen.

01:24:04.205 --> 01:24:07.038
For what you apparently thought
was a very clever stunt.

01:24:07.142 --> 01:24:11.169
You're getting deeper and deeper
into trouble with this court, Mr. Landers.

01:24:11.279 --> 01:24:12.769
Excuse me, Your Honor.

01:24:16.017 --> 01:24:17.109
It's him.

01:24:19.020 --> 01:24:20.385
Bobbie, it's him.

01:24:23.491 --> 01:24:25.982
-This is most irregular.
-Your Honor, he--

01:24:26.094 --> 01:24:27.652
I'll take it from here.

01:24:29.030 --> 01:24:31.123
May I ask who you are, sir?

01:24:31.232 --> 01:24:34.292
You better swear me in.
You'll never believe it.

01:24:43.044 --> 01:24:46.571
Do you swear to tell the truth,
the whole truth, and nothing but the truth?

01:24:46.681 --> 01:24:48.171
So help me me.

01:24:49.017 --> 01:24:50.541
So help you you?

01:24:51.953 --> 01:24:55.548
If it pleases the court,
and even if it doesn't please the court...

01:24:55.657 --> 01:24:57.557
...I'm God, Your Honor.

01:25:03.098 --> 01:25:04.690
Order in the court.

01:25:06.668 --> 01:25:10.798
Your Honor, I'd like permission
to question this witness.

01:25:11.206 --> 01:25:14.266
Sit down, Sonny,
I've answered enough questions.

01:25:18.947 --> 01:25:23.145
He saw me, just like he said.
Each word true.

01:25:24.352 --> 01:25:27.753
The man tried to tell a lie,
his tongue would snap off.

01:25:28.323 --> 01:25:31.383
Which I wouldn't say
I could say about everybody.

01:25:31.526 --> 01:25:33.494
Why is it so hard for you to believe?

01:25:33.628 --> 01:25:37.029
Is my physical existence
any more improbable than your own?

01:25:38.299 --> 01:25:41.598
What about all that hoo-hah with the devil
a while ago, from that movie?

01:25:41.736 --> 01:25:44.261
Nobody had trouble believing
that the devil took over...

01:25:44.405 --> 01:25:46.635
...and existed in the little girl.

01:25:46.941 --> 01:25:48.636
All she had to do was wet the rug...

01:25:48.776 --> 01:25:51.836
...throw up some pea soup,
and everybody believed.

01:25:53.114 --> 01:25:55.776
The devil you could believe, but not God?

01:25:57.218 --> 01:26:00.813
I work in my own way.
I don't get inside little children.

01:26:01.456 --> 01:26:04.289
They got enough to do,
just being themselves.

01:26:05.160 --> 01:26:08.095
I'm not going to go around
to every person in the world and say:

01:26:08.196 --> 01:26:10.596
"Look, it's me, I want to talk to you."

01:26:10.899 --> 01:26:12.491
So I picked one man.

01:26:14.169 --> 01:26:15.761
One very good man.

01:26:17.839 --> 01:26:20.603
I told him God lives. I live.

01:26:22.210 --> 01:26:26.704
He had trouble believing, too,
in the beginning. I understood.

01:26:29.017 --> 01:26:32.043
I'm not sure how
this whole miracle business started.

01:26:32.187 --> 01:26:36.055
The idea that anything connected with me
has to be a miracle.

01:26:36.791 --> 01:26:38.691
Personally, I'm sorry that it did.

01:26:38.793 --> 01:26:41.728
It makes the distance between us
even greater.

01:26:43.698 --> 01:26:47.725
But if a miracle helps you believe
that I am who I say I am...

01:26:50.972 --> 01:26:53.031
...I'll give you one, a good one.

01:26:53.875 --> 01:26:57.709
Let me see.
What's my most impressive miracle?

01:27:03.151 --> 01:27:04.812
Pick a card.

01:27:05.019 --> 01:27:08.477
-What?
-Pick a card, any card.

01:27:11.960 --> 01:27:16.863
-I don't know what you think you're doing.
-A cute little miracle. Go ahead, pick one.

01:27:17.098 --> 01:27:19.760
-There are no cards there.
-Look again.

01:27:26.474 --> 01:27:28.908
There's nothing miraculous
about good sleight of hand.

01:27:29.010 --> 01:27:31.103
Have you ever seen this one?

01:27:39.554 --> 01:27:43.923
Yes, I've seen them make cards appear
and disappear.

01:27:46.694 --> 01:27:50.061
As a matter of fact, I once saw
a magician make an elephant disappear.

01:27:50.431 --> 01:27:53.594
Good. Now I'll show you one
that you haven't seen.

01:27:57.105 --> 01:27:59.198
Have to get these shoes fixed.

01:28:01.843 --> 01:28:04.175
Watch this, Your Honor.

01:28:23.464 --> 01:28:26.695
<i>I know how hard it is, in these times,</i>
<i>to have faith.</i>

01:28:27.302 --> 01:28:30.635
<i>But maybe if you could have the faith</i>
<i>to start with...</i>

01:28:30.905 --> 01:28:35.808
<i>...maybe the times would change.</i>
<i>You could change them. Think about it.</i>

01:28:36.778 --> 01:28:39.713
<i>Try. And try not to hurt each other.</i>

01:28:40.548 --> 01:28:42.641
<i>There's been enough of that.</i>

01:28:43.117 --> 01:28:45.108
<i>It really gets in the way.</i>

01:28:45.720 --> 01:28:49.417
<i>I'm a God of very few words,</i>
<i>and Jerry's already given you mine.</i>

01:28:50.758 --> 01:28:54.717
<i>However hopeless, helpless,</i>
<i>mixed-up and scary it all gets...</i>

01:28:55.730 --> 01:28:57.197
<i>...it can work.</i>

01:28:57.999 --> 01:29:00.399
<i>If you find it hard to believe in me...</i>

01:29:00.601 --> 01:29:04.128
<i>...maybe it would help you to know</i>
<i>that I believe in you.</i>

01:29:04.839 --> 01:29:06.830
<i>Your Honor, I rest my case.</i>

01:29:19.854 --> 01:29:21.014
What?

01:29:27.862 --> 01:29:30.228
This court is now recessed.

01:29:32.333 --> 01:29:35.461
May I see both parties
in my chambers, please?

01:29:36.037 --> 01:29:39.837
<i>Do you swear to tell the truth,</i>
<i>the whole truth and nothing but the truth?</i>

01:29:40.575 --> 01:29:42.133
<i>So help you you?</i>

01:29:44.679 --> 01:29:45.839
Where's....

01:29:49.584 --> 01:29:51.176
<i>Order in the court.</i>

01:29:53.020 --> 01:29:57.286
<i>Your Honor, I'd like permission</i>
<i>to question this witness.</i>

01:30:07.468 --> 01:30:09.197
That's all there is.

01:30:09.604 --> 01:30:14.439
Not one word of what I assume
we all assume we heard.

01:30:14.542 --> 01:30:16.032
Someone must have erased it.

01:30:18.679 --> 01:30:21.113
Nobody erases tapes anymore.

01:30:22.583 --> 01:30:26.075
-Then the machine....
-No. Not a thing wrong with it.

01:30:27.488 --> 01:30:29.786
He said he couldn't be recorded.

01:30:29.891 --> 01:30:34.294
God, when he first spoke to me,
he said it wasn't his real voice I heard.

01:30:34.395 --> 01:30:37.125
He said he was just using one
that I could understand.

01:30:37.231 --> 01:30:38.926
He did it again today.

01:30:39.033 --> 01:30:41.797
And there's nothing wrong
with your stenotype machine?

01:30:41.903 --> 01:30:44.838
It took down every word, Your Honor,
except now...

01:30:44.972 --> 01:30:47.202
...some of them are not on the paper.

01:30:47.575 --> 01:30:50.874
Don't you see?
He wants us all to decide for ourselves...

01:30:50.978 --> 01:30:52.969
...whether or not we saw him
and heard him.

01:30:53.114 --> 01:30:56.208
It's what he always said,
that everything is up to us.

01:30:56.317 --> 01:31:01.016
No! There is no proof whatsoever
that God was in that courtroom today.

01:31:01.489 --> 01:31:03.753
No, none whatsoever.

01:31:03.858 --> 01:31:07.419
-We saw Him! We heard Him!
-We did.

01:31:10.097 --> 01:31:13.965
-He made himself and the cards disappear.
-We saw it.

01:31:15.102 --> 01:31:19.334
On the basis of our common experience
here today...

01:31:20.041 --> 01:31:23.602
...I can see why you first claimed,
and later maintained...

01:31:23.711 --> 01:31:28.171
...that you had seen,
and been in the actual presence of...

01:31:29.450 --> 01:31:30.417
...God.

01:31:30.918 --> 01:31:35.855
And for that reason,
your remarks to the Rev. Williams...

01:31:35.957 --> 01:31:38.391
...could be regarded
as a divine assignment.

01:31:39.393 --> 01:31:43.921
I shall rule, therefore,
that the charge of slander be dismissed.

01:31:44.966 --> 01:31:45.933
Sam!

01:31:47.068 --> 01:31:50.196
Now, if, as you also claim...

01:31:50.304 --> 01:31:53.967
...it is God's opinion...

01:31:54.242 --> 01:31:58.235
...that we should all make
our own decisions...

01:31:58.346 --> 01:32:00.906
...and abide by them accordingly...

01:32:01.015 --> 01:32:04.849
...then I must also rule
that on the basis of the evidence...

01:32:08.923 --> 01:32:12.051
...or rather the lack of it...

01:32:12.460 --> 01:32:15.588
...that as much as we all may think...

01:32:15.696 --> 01:32:18.358
...that what we saw here today was real...

01:32:19.500 --> 01:32:23.436
...God did not, in fact,
appear here before us.

01:32:26.941 --> 01:32:30.741
You may, of course,
appeal to a higher court.

01:32:32.780 --> 01:32:34.213
We heard from the highest court.

01:32:37.952 --> 01:32:39.249
Thank you.

01:32:40.121 --> 01:32:43.887
-Good-bye, Mister Slavic.
-And Jer, we'll send you your picture.

01:32:45.526 --> 01:32:47.118
-Would you do that?
-Sure.

01:32:47.228 --> 01:32:48.160
Thank you.

01:34:33.801 --> 01:34:34.927
Hello?

01:34:35.870 --> 01:34:37.963
-Where are you?
-Turn around.

01:34:46.580 --> 01:34:48.309
How do you like it?

01:34:48.416 --> 01:34:52.079
I'm going on a trip
to spend a little time with animals.

01:34:52.420 --> 01:34:56.356
I like animals, and sometimes
I don't spend enough time with them.

01:34:57.224 --> 01:35:01.024
-We failed, didn't we?
-What are you talking? We did terrific.

01:35:01.395 --> 01:35:05.798
I gave a message of encouragement,
you passed it along, now we'll see.

01:35:06.333 --> 01:35:09.894
You did good. We both did good.
We're covered.

01:35:10.204 --> 01:35:12.001
You think anybody got the message?

01:35:12.106 --> 01:35:15.166
Do you think we have enough apples
in the world?

01:35:15.576 --> 01:35:16.508
Apples?

01:35:16.677 --> 01:35:19.976
We got all the apples we need.
You're Johnny Appleseed.

01:35:20.081 --> 01:35:24.848
You drop a few seeds, and you move on.
If the seeds are good, they'll take root.

01:35:25.286 --> 01:35:27.811
I gave you great seeds, the best.

01:35:28.155 --> 01:35:29.645
I lost my job, you know.

01:35:30.424 --> 01:35:33.450
There are other cities, other supermarkets.

01:35:33.561 --> 01:35:35.256
Everybody thinks I'm a nut.

01:35:35.663 --> 01:35:40.100
Galileo, Pasteur, Einstein, Columbus.

01:35:40.501 --> 01:35:43.061
You're in good company. Hold on.

01:35:46.173 --> 01:35:47.731
Better be going.

01:35:48.175 --> 01:35:50.507
-Aren't you coming back?
-No.

01:35:50.745 --> 01:35:54.272
-Ever?
-When ever comes, we'll see.

01:35:54.715 --> 01:35:58.310
Sometimes, now and then...

01:35:59.520 --> 01:36:00.953
...couldn't we just talk?

01:36:01.055 --> 01:36:04.252
I'll tell you what. You talk, I'll listen.

01:36:05.305 --> 01:36:11.428
