00:14.240 --> 00:18.880
I am the Secretary of Defense of the United
States of America. You will listen to me.

00:23.760 --> 00:26.680
Put down your weapon.

00:27.920 --> 00:32.479
If another one of my men dies,
your daughter will be killed.

00:32.960 --> 00:36.000
- We need to get out of here. You're in danger.
- From who?

00:36.080 --> 00:38.960
Don't ask questions, just come with me.

00:39.040 --> 00:40.640
Debbie, what's wrong?

00:40.720 --> 00:43.440
Debbie, Debbie, what's wrong?

00:44.400 --> 00:47.480
What did you do to her?

00:51.800 --> 00:53.760
- O'Brian.
- Is the satellite up yet?

00:53.840 --> 00:56.960
No, I have to reposition
without Driscoll noticing. Where are you?

00:57.040 --> 01:00.480
I'm in a Mercury Mart. I staged a robbery.

01:00.560 --> 01:04.160
Tell those officers
to put their guns down and stand back.

01:04.640 --> 01:06.920
- I need you to help me.
- With what?

01:07.000 --> 01:09.680
- I've been in contact with Jack Bauer.
- What?

01:09.760 --> 01:15.000
- That's right. So either help me or turn me in.
- This could get me fired.

01:15.080 --> 01:17.000
I know you were working with her.

01:17.080 --> 01:20.880
- What do you want?
- I want your attention whenever I need it.

01:21.240 --> 01:25.280
Chloe, why are you logged on
to an active DOD satellite?

01:25.360 --> 01:28.440
- All right, you're done here.
- I was gonna quit anyway.

01:28.520 --> 01:29.920
I want you to call Jack Bauer now.

01:30.000 --> 01:33.600
- Driscoll wants to talk.
- Stand down. It's over.

01:33.680 --> 01:36.640
Erin, Hasan is free.
He's looking for a car and a phone.

01:36.720 --> 01:40.560
Once he has those things
he'll lead us straight to Heller.

01:44.160 --> 01:45.560
Son of a bitch.

01:45.640 --> 01:48.720
- " Get out of the car.
- " Get your hands up

01:48.800 --> 01:51.400
and step out of the vehicle.

02:00.200 --> 02:02.920
Do we still have a sat visual on Kalil Hasan?

02:03.000 --> 02:06.200
West of the 14 on Route 11.
Average speed, 62 miles per hour.

02:06.280 --> 02:08.479
I want traffic workups.

02:08.560 --> 02:11.720
We can't let anything prevent him
from reaching his destination.

02:11.800 --> 02:14.520
Key the tactical teams to Jack's location.

02:14.600 --> 02:18.640
- Want me to pre-empt that with Division?
- Yes, we'll run point.

02:18.720 --> 02:21.800
I can pull up those tactical teams for you,
if you want.

02:21.880 --> 02:27.760
You can't. That requires a level-three channel.
You don't have that kind of clearance.

02:27.840 --> 02:31.760
I have a Sergeant Paulsen
from the Sheriffs Department on line one.

02:31.840 --> 02:34.240
He says it's important.

02:39.440 --> 02:42.040
Sergeant Paulsen.
This is Erin Driscoll at CTU.

02:43.240 --> 02:47.600
I have a man named Jack Bauer in custody.
He claims he works with you. Is that true?

02:47.680 --> 02:50.920
- Yes, it is.
- "He just robbed a convenience store."

02:51.000 --> 02:54.640
Claims it was part of some
undercover operation to delay a suspect

02:54.720 --> 02:57.480
until satellite coverage could be established.

02:57.560 --> 03:01.920
- That's also true, Sergeant.
- It'd be nice if you communicated with us.

03:02.000 --> 03:04.720
There were
some national security issues involved.

03:04.800 --> 03:07.920
I'm sorry for any inconvenience.
May I speak to Mr Bauer?

03:08.440 --> 03:11.000
All right. Uncuff him.

03:17.120 --> 03:18.960
Thank you.

03:19.040 --> 03:21.560
- Tell me that you didn't arrest Hasan.
- No.

03:21.640 --> 03:24.080
He's still in the vehicle, we're tracking him.

03:24.160 --> 03:28.440
An intercepted phone call indicated
he's headed for the site where Heller's held.

03:28.520 --> 03:31.240
You'll need me
to coordinate things on the ground.

03:31.320 --> 03:35.320
We can get Heller and Audrey out of there,
but we need to work together.

03:35.400 --> 03:39.720
We have to find Heller before this trial starts.

03:40.320 --> 03:44.520
That's the right move, Erin.
He's our only option.

03:46.200 --> 03:50.640
All right, you're in, but you coordinate
through me. And Jack, make this work.

03:50.720 --> 03:55.120
I will. Please advise Sergeant Paulsen
of the new chain of command.

03:55.200 --> 03:58.240
- Yep.
- In my capacity as director of CTU,

03:58.320 --> 04:02.480
I'm vesting Jack Bauer with the authority
to control this part of the operation.

04:02.560 --> 04:04.520
Consider him in charge.

04:04.600 --> 04:06.680
- Yes, ma'am.
- Thank you.

04:06.760 --> 04:09.200
You're the new boss. Tell me what you need.

04:09.280 --> 04:13.360
The vehicle the hostile was driving
was stolen. If there's an APB on it,

04:13.440 --> 04:16.000
- I need you to get CHP to cancel it.
- Get on it.

04:16.079 --> 04:18.480
I left my CTU vehicle at the convenience mart.

04:18.560 --> 04:22.360
- I'll have it brought right over.
- Thank you.

04:37.640 --> 04:41.440
- Hasan's making another phone call.
- Patch it through to Jack.

04:45.920 --> 04:47.800
- Bauer.
- It's Edgar Stiles.

04:47.880 --> 04:52.200
Hasan's making another phone call.
I'm patching it to you.

04:53.080 --> 04:55.720
- " Yes?"
- It's Kalil. I'm on my way.

04:55.800 --> 04:58.600
- How much longer?
- About a half an hour.

04:58.680 --> 05:01.480
The broadcast must begin on time.

05:01.560 --> 05:05.320
- Any problems?
- Nothing I couldn't handle.

05:05.400 --> 05:07.680
How are you coming with the servers?

05:07.760 --> 05:11.240
Duman and Farez are managing,
but they could use your help.

05:11.320 --> 05:13.960
- I'll be there soon.
- All right.

05:14.720 --> 05:17.560
- Did Heller sign the confession?
- Yes.

05:17.640 --> 05:21.720
He didn't want to, but we used his daughter.

05:22.640 --> 05:25.480
Did you kill her?

05:25.560 --> 05:26.760
Not yet.

05:26.840 --> 05:30.320
- What's the ETA on my vehicle?
- Any second, Agent Bauer.

05:30.840 --> 05:33.440
I'll see you soon.

05:35.720 --> 05:36.600
Play it back.

05:40.920 --> 05:44.640
- Tell your men to stay on channel three.
- " Got it.

06:07.440 --> 06:12.600
Dad, you did what anyone else
would have done in your position.

06:14.760 --> 06:19.080
- I embarrassed my country.
- You signed a piece of paper.

06:19.160 --> 06:23.400
All lies. Everyone will know
that you signed it under duress.

06:23.480 --> 06:26.160
It's more than a piece of paper.

06:26.240 --> 06:29.800
This trial is gonna be a spectacle,
broadcast all over the world.

06:29.880 --> 06:33.200
Designed to humiliate
and degrade this country.

06:33.280 --> 06:35.960
Dad,

06:36.040 --> 06:38.360
there's still time.

06:38.440 --> 06:44.000
There's no sense in deluding ourselves.
There's less than an hour.

06:44.920 --> 06:48.880
If we're gonna do anything,
we have to do it now.

06:48.960 --> 06:51.760
We've done everything that we can.

06:52.760 --> 06:54.880
Not quite.

06:54.960 --> 06:57.560
What do you mean?

06:59.200 --> 07:03.080
What if I'm not alive?
They can't put me on trial.

07:03.160 --> 07:06.000
If I'm dead,
their goals go right out the window.

07:06.080 --> 07:09.520
And they'll be viewed
as nothing more than common assassins.

07:09.600 --> 07:12.440
- Dad.
- Listen to me.

07:12.520 --> 07:16.360
Even if I say what they want me to say,
they're not gonna let me go.

07:16.440 --> 07:19.400
They're gonna put me
in front of a camera, humiliate me,

07:19.480 --> 07:23.640
and then they're gonna kill me
with the whole world watching.

07:23.720 --> 07:27.440
There are people on the outside
looking for us. You cannot give up.

07:27.520 --> 07:31.240
I have to do something while I still can.

07:33.280 --> 07:35.880
And I need you to help me.

07:37.520 --> 07:39.040
Help you?

07:39.120 --> 07:44.240
The chain between your handcuffs.
See if you can get it up and around my neck.

07:44.320 --> 07:46.880
- No.
- I can't do it myself.

07:46.960 --> 07:50.280
I don't have any leverage.
But you can pull from back there.

07:50.360 --> 07:52.760
- Dad.
- I'm counting on you to help me.

07:52.840 --> 07:55.800
- Stop it. Stop it. Stop it!
- Give it a try at least. Try it!

07:55.880 --> 07:58.000
I won't do it.

08:01.280 --> 08:03.680
I won't do it, Dad.

08:20.280 --> 08:23.480
There's a gas pipe.

08:24.640 --> 08:27.920
- If we could break it...
- No.

08:28.440 --> 08:30.680
Break that, you die too.

08:31.800 --> 08:35.760
Do you think
that they're gonna let me out of here alive?

08:35.840 --> 08:37.600
Do you?

08:37.679 --> 08:40.280
They're gonna kill me, too.

08:46.760 --> 08:48.640
Dad.

08:54.920 --> 08:57.480
Together we can do this. We can do it.

08:57.560 --> 08:59.440
OK?

09:05.640 --> 09:08.240
Please.

09:08.320 --> 09:10.680
Let's try it.

09:18.120 --> 09:21.080
Almost there. OK.

09:21.160 --> 09:23.280
That's good.

09:38.560 --> 09:40.880
- You ready?
- Yeah.

09:52.880 --> 09:56.320
- I love you.
- I love you, too, honey.

10:14.040 --> 10:16.240
I want a full analysis on both these voices.

10:16.320 --> 10:20.400
- OK. I'll have it done in ten minutes.
- OK. Good.

10:23.720 --> 10:25.520
- Edgar.
- What, Marianne?

10:25.600 --> 10:28.320
- What's a level-three channel?
- A log on for all systems,

10:28.400 --> 10:30.640
tactical, district and division.

10:30.720 --> 10:33.480
- I want it.
- What do you mean?

10:33.560 --> 10:39.560
- I want clearance for a level-three channel.
- Only Driscoll can authorise that.

10:42.480 --> 10:44.600
I don't care. I want it.

10:44.680 --> 10:50.440
Just because you overheard Chloe and me,
doesn't mean I'm your bitch.

10:58.880 --> 11:01.520
I'm done being scared of you.

11:03.720 --> 11:07.000
- Ms Driscoll. It's Marianne.
- "Yes, Marianne. What is it?"

11:07.080 --> 11:10.920
I have further information regarding
Chloe circumventing your authority.

11:11.000 --> 11:15.120
- "I'm listening."
- I don't think she was acting alone.

11:15.200 --> 11:17.880
Who was she working with?

11:20.800 --> 11:23.440
I'm not sure. I found an echo on her call log.

11:23.520 --> 11:26.840
Every time she spoke to Jack,
there was someone else on the line.

11:26.920 --> 11:31.480
That's an automated behaviour.
It doesn't mean anyone else was on the line.

11:31.560 --> 11:34.040
Is that the extent of your suspicions?

11:34.840 --> 11:38.280
Yes. I'm sorry to have bothered you.

11:40.800 --> 11:43.360
- You're sick.
- You're gonna go to Driscoll,

11:43.440 --> 11:45.680
and you're gonna tell her
you need some help.

11:45.760 --> 11:49.800
And you're gonna ask her to issue me
a level-three channel clearance.

12:05.440 --> 12:08.400
- Unit Three, this is Bauer. Do you copy?
- " Copy."

12:08.480 --> 12:12.120
- Back off another 200 yards.
- "Roger that."

12:12.200 --> 12:13.960
- " Jack."
- Yeah.

12:14.040 --> 12:16.280
The marines are leaving base.

12:16.360 --> 12:19.520
Have Chloe collate the satellite images.

12:19.600 --> 12:22.200
Chloe's in a holding room.
She's been suspended.

12:22.280 --> 12:26.440
- We could use her help.
- It's under control. Curtis can collate them.

12:26.520 --> 12:28.640
Chloe was just doing what I asked her to.

12:28.720 --> 12:31.800
- She was supposed to be working for me.
- I understand, but...

12:31.880 --> 12:35.960
Jack, it's one thing
for you to disobey me in the field,

12:36.040 --> 12:39.080
but for someone who works for me
here at CTU to betray me...

12:39.160 --> 12:41.640
I can't reactivate her.
It's a nonstarter.

12:41.720 --> 12:44.680
Anything else?

12:44.760 --> 12:46.720
No, nothing else.

13:04.920 --> 13:09.280
- We have a situation here.
- I realise that. I can do the math.

13:10.000 --> 13:12.760
- The math?
- The protocols were violated.

13:12.840 --> 13:17.720
Someone has to take the bullet.
Jack's indispensable right now, and I'm not.

13:17.800 --> 13:21.320
- Took a lot of guts to do what you did.
- I trusted Jack.

13:21.400 --> 13:27.320
A lot of people around here trust Jack.
Doesn't mean they'll risk their careers for him.

13:28.040 --> 13:30.520
I have a suggestion.

13:30.600 --> 13:33.800
I'm gonna leave this room, call Admin.

13:34.840 --> 13:39.480
They'll fax over some resignation papers,
and you sign them.

13:39.560 --> 13:42.800
- And then what?
- And then nothing.

13:42.880 --> 13:45.600
- I walk out?
- You walk out.

13:47.280 --> 13:49.360
No jail? No sanctions?

13:49.440 --> 13:52.360
That's right.

13:52.440 --> 13:55.600
Though if you need a letter
of recommendation for your next job,

13:55.680 --> 13:59.000
you probably should get it from Jack, not me.

13:59.080 --> 14:00.560
Right.

14:00.640 --> 14:03.000
Sound like a plan?

14:03.080 --> 14:04.840
Yes.

14:18.800 --> 14:21.520
For God's sake, pull yourself together.

14:21.600 --> 14:24.000
She knew nothing.
You didn't have to kill her.

14:24.080 --> 14:27.920
Yes, I did. Because you didn't
have the courage to kill her yourself.

14:28.000 --> 14:31.640
Courage? To poison a girl
who did no harm to you at all?

14:42.360 --> 14:44.720
Your father's home.

14:46.840 --> 14:48.920
What are you doing? She's already dead.

14:49.000 --> 14:51.720
If he doesn't see a bullet wound,
he'll ask questions.

14:51.800 --> 14:55.280
Do you want him to know
you tried to help your girlfriend escape?

14:55.360 --> 14:57.760
Do you want him to know
you failed him again?

14:57.840 --> 15:00.400
Move away.

15:01.760 --> 15:04.200
Take it. Take it.

15:04.280 --> 15:07.920
Behrooz, take it! Take it.

15:09.480 --> 15:13.680
This has to stop, Behrooz.
You are my son, and I love you,

15:13.760 --> 15:16.160
but I cannot let you destroy everything.

15:16.240 --> 15:21.320
Everything we've worked so hard to achieve.

15:46.680 --> 15:49.320
I know this was difficult for you.

15:49.400 --> 15:52.080
But it was necessary.

15:52.160 --> 15:55.680
He'll dispose of the body tonight, after dark.

15:55.760 --> 16:01.360
Meanwhile, move her car.
Park it somewhere where it won't be seen.

16:01.440 --> 16:04.920
Then come straight back here. Navi.

16:50.840 --> 16:53.520
What?

16:53.600 --> 16:57.080
- You got your level-three channel clearance?
- Yes, I did.

16:57.160 --> 17:03.160
So we're done, right? I mean, I don't think
I should have to keep doing things for you.

17:06.200 --> 17:08.680
Why do you need a level-three clearance?

17:08.760 --> 17:12.240
You may be happy tapping
at a keyboard forever, but I'm not.

17:12.319 --> 17:17.319
I've an opportunity here to get ahead,
and I intend to use it.

17:30.840 --> 17:33.040
That's mine.

17:37.480 --> 17:39.680
I'll be right back.

17:43.520 --> 17:47.600
I'm more insulted you thought I wouldn't
notice than by the fact you spied on me.

17:47.680 --> 17:49.760
Driscoll ordered me to do it.

17:49.840 --> 17:54.920
Next time, use a Newman filter so the subject
doesn't see red lights flashing everywhere.

17:55.000 --> 17:56.960
Amateur.

17:57.040 --> 17:58.920
Bye, Edgar.

18:01.160 --> 18:04.640
Could you cover for me for just a second?

18:05.360 --> 18:07.400
Chloe.

18:07.480 --> 18:11.000
Could you guys give me a moment, please?

18:12.560 --> 18:15.240
- I'm really sorry this happened.
- Don't worry.

18:15.320 --> 18:19.680
- Driscoll doesn't know you were helping me.
- She doesn't?

18:19.760 --> 18:23.520
I'm the one who got you into this.
I'm not gonna sell you out.

18:23.600 --> 18:25.280
Thank you.

18:25.360 --> 18:27.560
You're a geek, Edgar.

18:27.640 --> 18:30.200
But you're a good guy. Stay that way.

18:30.280 --> 18:34.000
- I don't really have a choice.
- I guess not.

18:34.080 --> 18:37.120
Good luck today. You're gonna need it.

19:14.440 --> 19:18.680
Assuming he continues driving west,
what are our potential target areas?

19:18.760 --> 19:23.840
Hasan will reach one of four residential
communities and two industrial areas.

19:23.920 --> 19:28.320
Data mine those areas. Search for any
suspicious activity in the last six months.

19:28.400 --> 19:31.680
Citizen complaints,
known associates, everything.

19:31.760 --> 19:34.960
Jack, the hostile's stopping
on an intersection.

19:44.320 --> 19:47.000
OK. I got him.

20:16.600 --> 20:18.200
Yo, Mohammed.

20:18.280 --> 20:22.600
That's your name, right?
Ain't that what they call all you people?

20:22.680 --> 20:26.000
- I'm just trying to get home.
- Be nice if all y'all went home.

20:26.080 --> 20:28.320
Three men have approached Hasan's vehicle.

20:28.400 --> 20:32.240
- Edgar, can you enhance this?
- Hang on.

20:33.600 --> 20:36.760
- I don't want any trouble.
- Too late, Mohammed.

20:42.440 --> 20:46.120
Don't slip up. I'm watching you.
Say nothing, got that?

20:46.200 --> 20:49.160
You three. Stay right there.

20:52.040 --> 20:54.080
The police have got to stay clear.

20:54.160 --> 20:57.160
I ordered a cancellation
of the APB on the truck.

20:57.240 --> 21:00.720
It may not have gotten out yet
to all the local CHP branches.

21:00.800 --> 21:04.680
If they detain Hasan, he'll never
lead us to Heller. Put me through to CHP.

21:04.760 --> 21:07.360
Sarah.

21:07.440 --> 21:10.320
I have a priority call for local dispatch.

21:14.000 --> 21:18.440
- Do you wanna move this vehicle, please?
- " Yes, sir.

21:22.200 --> 21:24.800
Step out of the truck, please, sir.

21:29.840 --> 21:31.840
What's going on here?

21:31.920 --> 21:34.880
Working some things out
between him and I. That's all.

21:34.960 --> 21:37.560
- Is that right?
- Yes, sir.

21:39.120 --> 21:41.080
You three, stand by your car.

21:41.160 --> 21:43.400
Come on.

21:45.440 --> 21:48.280
We're gonna lose him. Get me CHP now.

21:48.840 --> 21:51.840
Wanna tell me what's going on here?

21:51.920 --> 21:54.280
There's really no problem, Officer.

21:54.360 --> 21:56.960
They're upset
about what happened this morning.

21:57.040 --> 21:59.920
Sorry about that, sir.

22:00.000 --> 22:02.960
- May I go now?
- Just bear with me one minute.

22:04.120 --> 22:08.120
- Why don't you go ahead and call this in?
- Copy that.

22:14.640 --> 22:16.800
Jack, I have local CHP dispatch.

22:16.880 --> 22:19.320
- Patch 'em through.
- "This is Officer Calvert."

22:19.400 --> 22:21.960
I cancelled an APB
on a yellow pick-up truck,

22:22.040 --> 22:25.960
licence plate number four,
Los Angeles, Independent, nine, four, five.

22:26.040 --> 22:28.800
I see it in the system.
I haven't had a cancellation.

22:28.880 --> 22:31.320
One of your officers
is questioning the driver.

22:31.400 --> 22:35.960
It is imperative that
that driver not be detained any longer.

22:39.880 --> 22:42.480
We'll get you on your way
as soon as possible.

22:42.560 --> 22:46.440
It's just routine. Don't let those guys
get to you. They're just punks.

22:46.520 --> 22:48.800
Yeah. I understand.

22:48.880 --> 22:54.480
I think everybody's been a bit jumpy today,
with everything that's going on.

22:55.720 --> 22:58.520
Thanks for your patience.
It won't be another minute.

22:58.600 --> 23:00.840
6214, come in.

23:00.920 --> 23:02.800
LA6214. Copy.

23:02.880 --> 23:06.440
- "6214, there's a 10-22 on the 2-15."
- Roger that.

23:06.520 --> 23:08.000
10-1.

23:09.440 --> 23:11.680
We're all clear.

23:11.760 --> 23:13.720
Have a nice day, sir.

23:13.800 --> 23:15.880
Thank you, sir.

23:22.880 --> 23:24.960
He's moving.

23:35.320 --> 23:38.960
- He's making another call.
- Pipe it through to Jack.

23:40.640 --> 23:44.360
Jack, Kalil's making another call.

23:44.880 --> 23:47.680
Finish the set up, and let's do a test.

23:49.520 --> 23:50.600
Yes?

23:50.680 --> 23:53.240
- " We may have a problem."
- I'm listening.

23:53.320 --> 23:56.240
The police ran the plates
of the vehicle I'm driving.

23:56.320 --> 23:58.880
- And?
- They let me go.

23:58.960 --> 24:01.200
- Jack, are you getting this?
- Yeah.

24:01.280 --> 24:05.200
- "What is the problem?"
- This is a stolen car.

24:05.280 --> 24:08.400
- Maybe the owner hasn't reported it yet.
- Maybe I'm getting help

24:08.480 --> 24:11.080
from people who wanna make sure I get there.

24:11.160 --> 24:13.160
Do not jump to conclusions.

24:13.240 --> 24:16.280
A police officer was approaching me,
his hand on his gun.

24:16.360 --> 24:18.920
He got a call, suddenly there's no problem.

24:25.360 --> 24:27.240
We can't take any chances.

24:27.320 --> 24:31.480
He's not gonna lead us to the site. The best
we can do is take him alive and break him.

24:31.560 --> 24:34.520
All units. Move in. I repeat, move in.

24:39.280 --> 24:44.200
OK, I've got a visual.
Set up a roadblock at mile-marker 15.

24:45.680 --> 24:49.240
It has been an honour
working with you, Omar.

24:49.320 --> 24:52.120
The honour has been mine, Kalil.

24:53.200 --> 24:55.840
Come on.

24:55.920 --> 24:57.800
Allah Akbar.

24:58.000 --> 25:00.000
Allah Akbar.

25:23.000 --> 25:25.280
No!

25:35.360 --> 25:37.680
He drove head-on into another vehicle.

25:37.760 --> 25:40.360
He was our only lead.

26:00.240 --> 26:03.880
" Edgar, were you able
to trace the call?

26:03.960 --> 26:08.120
OK. We're gonna switch gears,
since we've lost our only lead.

26:08.200 --> 26:11.480
Kalil Hasan committed suicide
en route to Heller's location.

26:11.560 --> 26:14.280
Have they recovered anything
that might help?

26:14.360 --> 26:17.640
It's too soon to tell.
They're still putting out the fire.

26:17.720 --> 26:20.240
How much time do we have before this trial?

26:20.320 --> 26:22.840
Ten, fifteen minutes.

26:22.920 --> 26:24.600
- Sarah Gavin.
- "It's me."

26:24.680 --> 26:27.040
- It's Jack.
- Put him on speaker.

26:27.120 --> 26:28.400
Go ahead.

26:28.480 --> 26:31.360
I'm sifting through the wreckage,
there's not much intact.

26:31.440 --> 26:35.160
Hasan said he was 30 minutes
from his destination 20 minutes ago.

26:35.240 --> 26:37.440
- Do we have a maximum perimeter?
- Edgar?

26:37.520 --> 26:39.840
A radius of 60 miles, centred at Acton.

26:39.920 --> 26:42.800
We're dispatching choppers
to survey the area.

26:42.880 --> 26:46.240
That'll take too long.
Use the satellites, conduct a thermal scan.

26:46.320 --> 26:50.160
Won't work. There's a high
concentration of electric power transmitters.

26:50.240 --> 26:52.520
The satellite can't distinguish the servers.

26:52.600 --> 26:57.760
Those transmitters have been there for years.
Lay a scan against the previous grid pattern.

26:57.840 --> 27:00.240
We can identify any new thermal activity.

27:00.320 --> 27:02.680
- We can start the scan immediately.
- Do it.

27:02.760 --> 27:06.480
We're using the satellite
to check the thermals. Keep the line open.

27:06.560 --> 27:07.600
Hurry.

27:07.680 --> 27:11.240
The clinic wanted me to tell you
that your daughter has arrived.

27:11.320 --> 27:12.960
Thank you.

27:13.040 --> 27:18.000
All right. Everyone reset your systems.
Let's get back on track.

27:18.080 --> 27:22.600
I have to take care of something. Check in
with Division, they're expecting an update.

27:22.680 --> 27:26.480
- Everything all right?
- I had to bring my daughter to the clinic.

27:26.560 --> 27:29.560
- Is she OK?
- She's fine. Call Division.

27:39.480 --> 27:41.680
What are you working on?

27:41.760 --> 27:45.000
Personnel allocations
and tactical generals for the teams.

27:45.080 --> 27:50.360
Every time I look over here,
you're talking to Edgar. What's that all about?

27:50.440 --> 27:54.080
Just trying to learn the ropes, Curtis.

27:56.280 --> 28:00.000
Today is not the day
to make career moves on people, Marianne.

28:00.080 --> 28:04.240
You should be thinking about how to help us
stop Heller from being executed.

28:04.320 --> 28:07.400
- Come on, Curtis. Give me some credit.
- Save it.

28:07.480 --> 28:13.480
I know how you think. Just leave everybody
alone, and help us get through today.

28:19.200 --> 28:20.680
Mark.

28:20.760 --> 28:23.800
Thank you for helping me out.
They said Maya's arrived.

28:23.880 --> 28:27.600
She's in the exam area.
We're about to do a workup.

28:28.200 --> 28:30.960
She's been on Thorazine.
She stopped taking it.

28:31.040 --> 28:34.800
- How long ago?
- Based on this morning, at least a few days.

28:34.880 --> 28:37.560
- What?
- She was fixating on a neighbour's kid.

28:37.640 --> 28:40.080
- What does she do?
- She walks into their yard,

28:40.160 --> 28:42.240
gets verbally abusive.

28:42.320 --> 28:45.800
- We'll take good care of her.
- Thank you.

28:50.240 --> 28:55.000
- Maya.
- I'm so happy to see you. I was going crazy.

28:55.080 --> 28:57.160
Why did you go over to Evan's?

28:57.240 --> 29:03.960
I know you said not to,
but he was throwing things against the fence.

29:04.040 --> 29:08.840
Maya. He plays with a ball.
He's seven years old, sweetheart.

29:08.920 --> 29:11.880
I don't care how old he is.
He should know better.

29:11.960 --> 29:16.000
Are you gonna talk to his dad about this?

29:16.080 --> 29:18.480
Come here.

29:22.880 --> 29:25.080
Look at me.

29:26.280 --> 29:30.680
You're not thinking clearly, honey.
You've got to put it out of your mind.

29:30.760 --> 29:35.440
Dr Kaylis is gonna help,
and you're gonna feel better very soon.

29:35.520 --> 29:38.560
- Why don't we go home, right now?
- We can't, honey.

29:38.640 --> 29:40.600
Why not?

29:43.200 --> 29:47.040
There's a little trouble here in LA,
and I have to take care of it.

29:47.120 --> 29:50.960
- Are you gonna be OK?
- Yes, I'm gonna be OK.

29:51.720 --> 29:53.720
And you're gonna be OK.

29:53.800 --> 29:56.640
I love you so much.

29:57.680 --> 30:00.640
- I love you too, honey.
- I love you.

30:00.720 --> 30:03.880
- It's gonna be OK.
- Mm-hm.

30:05.960 --> 30:07.320
Shh.

30:07.400 --> 30:10.080
It's OK. It's OK.

30:11.240 --> 30:13.920
- Yes.
- " Kalil is dead."

30:14.000 --> 30:15.760
Dead? How?

30:15.840 --> 30:21.400
He was being followed here.
He martyred himself. Without hesitation.

30:21.480 --> 30:24.920
And the servers? Have they been
reconformed for the broadcast?

30:25.000 --> 30:28.440
Duman is doing his best.
I think we'll be all right.

30:28.520 --> 30:32.680
- If you need help, I can come.
- No, no, no, no. It is too risky.

30:32.760 --> 30:37.720
If the servers don't work correctly, we're
in trouble. This trial is only the beginning.

30:37.800 --> 30:40.680
I know that as well as you, my friend.

30:40.760 --> 30:45.720
But there's no need to worry.
Everything will go as planned.

30:47.120 --> 30:49.880
- You've checked out the briefcase?
- It's fine.

30:49.960 --> 30:53.000
I was afraid it might be damaged,
in the train crash.

30:53.080 --> 30:56.240
The case is very strong.
There's no problem.

30:56.320 --> 30:58.920
Good. Then you can get started.

31:03.160 --> 31:05.440
Gas.

31:05.520 --> 31:08.320
I smell gas.

31:08.400 --> 31:10.440
Heller.

31:18.240 --> 31:21.280
Get them out. Now! Come on.

31:21.720 --> 31:23.800
Hurry. Let's go.

31:23.880 --> 31:26.080
Take them out.

31:27.760 --> 31:29.960
Come on.

31:34.120 --> 31:36.920
Put them down. Put them down now.

31:38.720 --> 31:41.960
Hurry. Open the door. Now!

31:42.040 --> 31:45.880
Come on. Do whatever it takes to revive him.

31:47.400 --> 31:49.440
Keep trying.

32:12.840 --> 32:15.680
I know you.

32:15.760 --> 32:18.720
She recognised me.
She has to be killed.

32:18.800 --> 32:21.240
She will. In good time.

32:21.880 --> 32:23.880
Go do your job.

32:23.960 --> 32:25.320
Go.

32:30.560 --> 32:32.360
- "Jack, it's Erin."
- Yeah.

32:32.440 --> 32:35.840
We got the results from the scan.
One site matches the criteria.

32:35.920 --> 32:39.760
- Where?
- An old industrial park, three miles from you.

32:39.840 --> 32:42.800
- Exact address?
- " Off a service road, south of Brock.

32:42.880 --> 32:45.800
I'll set up the area.
Where's the marine strike force?

32:45.880 --> 32:48.520
20 minutes away. This trial starts any minute.

32:48.600 --> 32:50.680
I'll get back to you soon as I'm on site.

32:50.760 --> 32:54.200
Download the schematics of the building
and send them to me.

32:54.280 --> 32:55.480
Edgar's on it.

33:09.360 --> 33:13.400
- Pick the rest of these up later.
- " Yes, Mr President.

33:13.480 --> 33:16.600
- What is it, Robert?
- CTU thinks it's identified the location

33:16.680 --> 33:18.840
where the terrorists are holding Heller.

33:18.920 --> 33:21.360
- Where?
- A compound in Santa Clarita.

33:21.440 --> 33:25.960
There is a problem. The teams may not
get there in time to prevent the broadcast,

33:26.040 --> 33:31.800
and even they do, there is a good chance the
secretary will be killed in any rescue attempt.

33:31.880 --> 33:36.600
Well, we have no choice
but to hope and pray that you're wrong.

33:36.680 --> 33:41.080
We do have a choice.
The secretary's death would be tragic,

33:41.160 --> 33:45.400
but his execution on American soil,
broadcast to the world, would be far worse.

33:45.480 --> 33:49.320
It would be a humiliation for the country.
Perhaps the worst in our history.

33:49.400 --> 33:54.440
I'm well aware of that. But unless you have
some solution, I'm missing the point.

33:54.520 --> 33:57.360
The solution is, we make a pre-emptive strike.

33:57.440 --> 34:00.160
Assuming we locate the site in time,
we destroy it.

34:00.240 --> 34:05.200
- We kill our own secretary of defense?
- To prevent the public spectacle of his death.

34:05.280 --> 34:07.880
He's going to be killed anyway.

34:16.679 --> 34:19.000
Jim Heller is a good friend.

34:19.920 --> 34:22.639
A loyal public servant.

34:24.040 --> 34:27.360
You expect me to kill him to save face?

34:27.440 --> 34:30.679
Not yours, sir. The country's.

34:30.760 --> 34:34.800
If we look impotent in this situation,
we'll only encourage more attacks.

34:34.880 --> 34:39.480
And if I may say so, sir, having known
Jim Heller many years myself, if he were here,

34:39.560 --> 34:44.600
- he'd be the first to endorse this plan.
- The public will never accept it.

34:44.679 --> 34:48.520
All the public will know
is the secretary died during a rescue attempt,

34:48.600 --> 34:54.600
which is more palatable than letting him
be executed with the whole world watching.

35:30.160 --> 35:32.640
It's a woman. I don't know her.

35:39.600 --> 35:40.280
God.

35:40.360 --> 35:43.040
- Who is she?
- It's Debbie's mom.

35:43.120 --> 35:46.280
- Go back. Stay there until she leaves.
- What are you gonna do?

35:46.360 --> 35:48.960
Go.

35:51.400 --> 35:55.040
- It's the girl's mother.
- What?

35:57.520 --> 35:59.280
- Mrs Araz?
- Yes.

35:59.360 --> 36:04.000
- I'm Karen Pendleton, Debbie's mother.
- Oh, good to meet you. Call me Dina.

36:04.080 --> 36:07.880
It's good to meet you. My husband and I
are very fond of Behrooz.

36:07.960 --> 36:12.600
He's one of the few boys who seem to know
the meaning of "please" and "thank you".

36:12.680 --> 36:15.040
Oh, I'm looking for Debbie.

36:16.440 --> 36:19.720
This is my husband Navi.
This is Debbie's mother.

36:19.800 --> 36:23.040
- Oh, she's a very lovely girl.
- " Thank you.

36:23.120 --> 36:27.200
We got a call from our dermatologist.
She missed her appointment. Is she here?

36:27.280 --> 36:29.560
We haven't seen her since yesterday.

36:29.640 --> 36:33.360
- She was on her way to see Behrooz.
- There must be a misunderstanding.

36:33.440 --> 36:37.200
- Perhaps she stopped off.
- No, she knew she had this appointment.

36:37.280 --> 36:39.840
It'll take weeks to reschedule.

36:41.360 --> 36:44.320
- Is Behrooz here?
- He is studying.

36:44.400 --> 36:46.520
- Maybe he knows where she is.
- I doubt it.

36:46.600 --> 36:52.760
He hasn't left his room all morning.
School is very important to him.

36:57.600 --> 37:00.200
That's her phone. I know the ring.

37:00.280 --> 37:03.080
Many... Many phones sound alike,
Mrs Pendleton.

37:03.160 --> 37:08.600
No, she downloaded that ring specially.
It's one of her favourite songs.

37:08.680 --> 37:13.200
- No, that's definitely her phone.
- " Mrs Pendleton.

37:14.480 --> 37:18.480
It was my phone. Debbie and I downloaded
the same ring when we started going out.

37:18.560 --> 37:21.720
Oh. Do you know where she is?

37:22.400 --> 37:25.160
She said she had
a doctor's appointment this morning,

37:25.240 --> 37:28.520
and we're supposed to go to the movies later.

37:29.600 --> 37:33.200
I'm sorry about this. I'm just worried.

37:34.040 --> 37:36.560
If you do see her, will you have her call me?

37:36.640 --> 37:39.480
- Oh, yes. Of course.
- Of course.

37:43.120 --> 37:47.080
- I told you not to interfere.
- It was her phone. I shut it off.

37:47.160 --> 37:49.360
He took care of it, Navi.

37:49.440 --> 37:52.200
She went away because she believed him.

37:52.280 --> 37:54.600
Let's hope so.

37:56.640 --> 38:00.200
Get in the car. Follow her.
Make sure she doesn't go to the police.

38:00.280 --> 38:02.480
All right.

38:22.320 --> 38:24.840
Have you worked up the rescue approach?

38:24.920 --> 38:26.960
We're running up scenarios now.

38:27.040 --> 38:30.760
What are the probabilities of finding
the secretary and his daughter?

38:30.840 --> 38:34.800
The data's fuzzy, but at best guess,
they're in the west end of the building.

38:34.880 --> 38:36.800
- Together?
- We don't know.

38:36.880 --> 38:40.320
We need a team split -
one for the secretary, one for his daughter.

38:40.400 --> 38:42.840
We discussed that, but it was rejected.

38:42.920 --> 38:45.840
- What are you talking about?
- It comes from the president.

38:45.920 --> 38:50.480
There'll be very little time to secure
the hostages. Our priority is to get Heller.

38:50.560 --> 38:55.360
- That doesn't make sense.
- I don't like it, but those are the orders.

38:56.960 --> 38:59.720
Jack, they're about to begin the broadcast.

38:59.800 --> 39:02.120
I'm almost there.

39:02.200 --> 39:03.440
Dammit.

39:27.400 --> 39:33.080
We are about to embark on a process
of justice that will forever change the world.

39:33.160 --> 39:37.760
Our people will finally be liberated
from the tangle of corruption

39:37.840 --> 39:40.640
that has been choking them for centuries.

39:40.720 --> 39:44.760
No longer will justice
be the propagandist tool of the power elite.

39:44.840 --> 39:47.960
It will once again
become the instrument of the people,

39:48.040 --> 39:50.840
delivered through true believers,

39:50.920 --> 39:57.400
whose courage to use the sword has made
this day not only possible, but inevitable.

39:57.480 --> 40:01.800
I've taken the liberty of having a laser-guided
missile programmed and prepped.

40:01.880 --> 40:07.640
- All that remains is for you to give the order.
- How long between my order and impact?

40:07.720 --> 40:12.320
The fighter's in the air, it needs
to get in range. No more than ten minutes.

40:12.400 --> 40:17.960
... without prejudice. For we will be judged,
the same as our enemies,

40:18.040 --> 40:20.560
as our prisoner shall be judged today.

40:20.640 --> 40:23.480
Do it. Let Driscoll know.

40:23.560 --> 40:28.720
Today is the day
the United States of America will be tested...

40:37.800 --> 40:39.800
It's been authorised, ma'am.

40:39.880 --> 40:42.080
Yes, I understand.

40:47.960 --> 40:49.280
Yeah?

40:49.360 --> 40:52.600
- " Ms Driscoll for you."
- " What's your position?"

40:52.680 --> 40:54.040
I'm on site.

40:54.600 --> 40:56.440
Jack, stand down.

40:56.520 --> 40:58.040
What are you talking about?

40:58.120 --> 41:02.240
The president wants to take out
the building with a missile strike.

41:02.320 --> 41:05.560
- With the secretary and his daughter inside?
- Yes.

41:05.640 --> 41:07.320
Let me speak to the president.

41:07.400 --> 41:09.640
I've been trying to get through to him.

41:09.720 --> 41:13.040
I'm sorry. You're gonna have to clear the area.

41:14.800 --> 41:17.680
Jack, don't go in there alone.

41:17.760 --> 41:21.640
Jack, talk to me.
The air strike's already been ordered.

41:21.720 --> 41:23.920
Get out of there.

41:52.280 --> 41:55.360
