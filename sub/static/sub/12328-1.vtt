35:31.109 --> 35:33.805
FBl, ma'am.
lt's about Samir Horn.

35:35.413 --> 35:38.905
Now, the State Department hasn't answered
any of my letters for weeks.

35:38.983 --> 35:41.713
l mean, l don't even know
what prison he's being held in.

35:41.786 --> 35:43.811
Well, he's not being held anymore.

35:43.888 --> 35:45.412
He has escaped.

35:45.490 --> 35:48.015
When?
A week ago.

35:48.092 --> 35:51.357
lt was a prison break organized
by the terrorist group he's working with.

35:51.429 --> 35:53.454
What are you talking about?

35:53.531 --> 35:55.328
l mean, this whole thing is a mistake.

35:55.400 --> 35:58.460
l'm afraid it's not, ma'am.
We have evidence.

35:58.536 --> 35:59.901
- What evidence?
- That's classified.

35:59.971 --> 36:02.337
- l can't tell you that.
- Yeah, of course it is.

36:05.977 --> 36:09.413
You people are incredible.

36:09.481 --> 36:12.279
How long has it been
since you've seen him?

36:12.350 --> 36:15.251
l don't remember.

36:15.320 --> 36:17.811
lf you want to help Samir,
you should talk to me.

36:17.889 --> 36:20.551
Do you think that every
Muslim man is a terrorist?

36:20.625 --> 36:22.183
On the contrary.

36:22.260 --> 36:23.818
l am, however,
looking for those who are.

36:23.895 --> 36:25.863
Now if you have any knowledge
of what he's been involved in,

36:25.930 --> 36:27.659
you do have an obligation
to share that with me.

36:27.732 --> 36:29.563
Are you charging me with anything?

36:29.634 --> 36:30.692
No, l'm not.

36:30.768 --> 36:32.668
When you have something more
than secret evidence,

36:32.737 --> 36:33.931
then l'll talk to you.

36:37.108 --> 36:40.043
Uh, they just fired him.
No explanation.

36:40.111 --> 36:42.773
But, uh, it was pretty obvious why.

36:42.847 --> 36:44.747
How did Samir take it?

36:44.816 --> 36:46.340
How do you think?

36:46.417 --> 36:47.975
So why did you let Mr. Horn go?

36:48.052 --> 36:50.247
Jeez, that was over a year ago.

36:50.321 --> 36:51.982
l don't recall the details.

36:52.056 --> 36:55.958
The information that we gather
for these types of background checks

36:56.027 --> 36:57.016
is strictly confidential.

36:57.095 --> 36:59.393
Look, as far as l'm concerned,

36:59.464 --> 37:01.364
a man's religion is his own business.

37:01.432 --> 37:05.129
But when you wear a skullcap
and pray to Allah five times a day,

37:05.203 --> 37:07.171
people are gonna notice.

37:07.238 --> 37:08.865
Some of our clients complained.

37:30.929 --> 37:32.726
Horn gets to Chicago when he's 12.

37:32.797 --> 37:35.163
He's just watched his father die.
He's arrived from Sudan.

37:35.233 --> 37:37.895
He's going through culture shock.
lt's a classic profile.

37:37.969 --> 37:40.028
He's caught between
traditional lslam and the West.

37:40.104 --> 37:41.571
His test scores are off the charts.

37:41.639 --> 37:43.630
But it said he had
some behavioral problems.

37:43.708 --> 37:46.643
He was kicked out of high school
his senior year for getting into a fight.

37:46.711 --> 37:47.700
About what?

37:47.779 --> 37:49.542
Three white students
were harassing a black girl.

37:49.614 --> 37:50.774
Horn intervened.

37:50.848 --> 37:53.578
Two of the boys
had to be hospitalized.

37:53.651 --> 37:55.778
Now he enlisted in the military
right after that.

37:55.853 --> 37:57.980
His Army file was classified.

37:58.056 --> 37:59.990
But here's a copy.

38:00.058 --> 38:02.686
After he leaves the Army,
Horn fights in Afghanistan

38:02.760 --> 38:04.091
for a few years.

38:04.162 --> 38:07.859
The list of people he could have met there
is practically a who's who of lslamic terrorists,

38:07.932 --> 38:09.866
from Abdul Azim
to Osama bin Laden.

38:09.934 --> 38:12.402
Now we pretty much lose track of him
until he shows up in Bosnia

38:12.470 --> 38:14.768
where he meets Chandra Dawkin,
the photojournalist.

38:14.839 --> 38:16.670
- ls she a spy?
- No.

38:16.741 --> 38:18.140
The FBl tried to question her,

38:18.209 --> 38:20.677
but my source says
she was uncooperative.

38:20.745 --> 38:22.474
Last fall is when things
seemed to change.

38:22.547 --> 38:25.516
He loses his job, spends more
and more time at the mosque.

38:25.583 --> 38:28.984
Then he begins disappearing
on these long trips overseas.

38:29.053 --> 38:30.520
Last one he never comes back from.

38:30.588 --> 38:32.522
And somewhere along the way
he meets up with someone

38:32.590 --> 38:34.649
who's connected with Nathir and bingo!

38:34.726 --> 38:36.956
You got yourself a terrorist.

he could have blown everybody up.

39:15.233 --> 39:17.360
No. Nobody cares
about you being sorry.

39:17.435 --> 39:20.302
We cannot have mistakes.
We can't play around with this shit, Omar.

39:20.371 --> 39:22.202

40:25.336 --> 40:29.136
All right.
Let's see what you have.

printing out for you know, sir.

40:31.843 --> 40:33.367
l got something.

51:20.491 --> 51:21.788
Yeah.

51:52.122 --> 51:54.590
Traces of PETN, RDX.

51:54.658 --> 51:55.852
Semtex again.

51:55.926 --> 51:58.360
Just like the other Nathir attacks.

51:58.429 --> 52:00.420
Except all the other attacks
were suicide bombers,

52:00.497 --> 52:02.465
and this looks like
it's from an RF Receiver, hmm?

52:02.533 --> 52:03.693
Yes.

52:03.767 --> 52:05.325
He used small charges.

52:05.402 --> 52:07.666
One...

52:07.738 --> 52:08.762
and two.

52:08.839 --> 52:11.967
But just in the correct place
to make collapse the building.

52:12.042 --> 52:14.101
This man, he knows what he's doing.

52:15.612 --> 52:17.546
RF range is usually
no more than a hundred meters,

52:17.614 --> 52:19.445
so let's pull the tapes
for all the security cameras

52:19.516 --> 52:21.575
within a five-block radius.

53:26.450 --> 53:27.610
No one there.
Keep going.

53:27.684 --> 53:28.673
- More.

54:13.497 --> 54:15.055
What happened?

54:15.132 --> 54:16.929
There were no Americans inside.

54:17.000 --> 54:19.093
The two dead embassy
employees were fakes,

54:19.169 --> 54:21.000
bodies from the morgue
with false identities

54:21.071 --> 54:22.060
just like we talked about.

54:22.139 --> 54:23.606
Why is the news saying eight people?

54:23.674 --> 54:26.438
There was some unscheduled maintenance
in a part of the consulate

54:26.510 --> 54:29.479
that was supposed to be empty,
all right?

54:29.546 --> 54:31.537
l didn't know they'd be there.

54:31.615 --> 54:34.015
Listen, we couldn't control everything.

54:34.084 --> 54:37.076
Nobody was supposed to die!
l'm sorry, Samir.

54:48.231 --> 54:50.392
Look, what do you want me to say?

54:50.467 --> 54:51.593
We set off a bomb.

54:51.668 --> 54:54.034
No, l set off a bomb.

55:06.883 --> 55:09.852

l even switched my major

56:53.090 --> 56:55.718
You were a Religion major?

57:51.481 --> 57:53.506
lt's a great honor, Emir.

57:53.583 --> 57:54.948
Please, sit.

57:55.018 --> 57:56.280
Thank you.

57:59.790 --> 58:02.122
- Tea?
- Yes, thank you.

58:05.695 --> 58:09.358
Omar tells me that you play chess.

58:09.432 --> 58:11.195
Only a little. Thank you.

58:11.268 --> 58:13.964
ln chess and in war,
the key to winning

58:14.037 --> 58:17.200
is to anticipate what your opponent
will do in advance.

58:17.274 --> 58:19.606
Think two moves ahead.

58:19.676 --> 58:21.974
The art of asymmetrical warfare

58:22.045 --> 58:26.948
is less about inflicting damage
than provoking a response.

58:27.017 --> 58:29.315
Terrorism is theater.

58:29.386 --> 58:33.220
And theater is always performed
for an audience.

58:33.290 --> 58:36.054
Ours is the American people.

58:36.126 --> 58:42.087
But we are dispersed
across a large country.

58:42.165 --> 58:44.099
The question is,

58:44.167 --> 58:47.898
how to convince them
that nowhere is safe.

58:49.806 --> 58:51.706
Samir, imagine a bus
traveling cross-country

58:51.775 --> 58:53.504
filled with average, everyday Americans.

58:53.577 --> 58:55.010
People from-- from all over.

58:55.078 --> 58:57.740
From small towns,
from the country.

58:57.814 --> 58:59.839
lmagine the effect it would have

58:59.916 --> 59:04.683
if that very same bus
were to suddenly explode.

59:04.754 --> 59:07.245
Now multiply that by 50.

59:07.324 --> 59:11.556
Fifty buses across
the heartland of America,

59:11.628 --> 59:13.357
all at the same time,

59:13.430 --> 59:15.921
on the same day.

59:15.999 --> 59:20.629
<i>We call this operation
Risala Shukra Al-hiba.</i>

59:20.704 --> 59:23.195
For years we've been planting
martyrs in their midst.

59:24.708 --> 59:26.733
They are waiting for a signal,

59:26.810 --> 59:29.836
instructions, material.

59:31.181 --> 59:35.584
We need somebody who can move
about the country without drawing attention.

59:35.652 --> 59:38.883
Somebody who blends in.

59:41.758 --> 59:44.318
An American messenger, Samir.

59:58.375 --> 01:00:01.037
He isn't capable of this.

01:00:01.111 --> 01:00:03.705
l don't like having to show
these to you, Chandra.

01:00:03.780 --> 01:00:06.749
But we need to find him
before this happens again.

01:00:06.816 --> 01:00:11.981
Samir always said that these people
were lslam's worse enemies.

01:00:12.055 --> 01:00:14.615
Oh, he fought a Holy War
with these folks in Afghanistan

01:00:14.691 --> 01:00:16.556
and then again in Bosnia.

01:00:16.626 --> 01:00:18.560
He was trained to kill.

01:00:18.628 --> 01:00:21.222
He was a soldier, not a murderer.

01:00:22.832 --> 01:00:26.131
l believe he deceived you
as much as anybody else.

01:00:29.940 --> 01:00:34.570
His faith was a source of strength.

01:00:35.979 --> 01:00:37.344
Not this.

01:00:56.199 --> 01:00:58.326
- Welcome to the U.S.
- Thanks.

01:01:29.099 --> 01:01:31.033

01:01:31.101 --> 01:01:33.433

get in a room with Nathir again?

Then you keep on going.

01:03:20.176 --> 01:03:22.576
Well, the problem is,
to keep going means

01:03:22.645 --> 01:03:25.113

l have kept you completely
off the books.

Look, l don't give a shit
about any of that, okay?

01:03:44.868 --> 01:03:46.495
We need to rethink things.

01:03:46.569 --> 01:03:50.096
lf you don't succeed,
we may not get another chance.

01:03:52.809 --> 01:03:56.677
How far are you willing to take this?

01:03:56.746 --> 01:03:58.907

they'll have died for nothing.

l thought we decided to use coded e-mail.

No, no, we did. We did.

01:05:24.734 --> 01:05:26.429

can get intercepted.

01:05:26.502 --> 01:05:29.027
l got a better idea.

01:05:29.105 --> 01:05:32.836
We're gonna give each of our people

we log onto each one,

we write the instructions,
but we don't send them.

01:05:38.147 --> 01:05:39.512
We save it as a draft.

they check their unsent messages.

Perhaps you haven't had time
to read the fine print of the Patriot Act,

01:10:29.105 --> 01:10:31.335
but any person operating
a money transmitting business

01:10:31.407 --> 01:10:32.704
must register with the U.S. government.

01:10:32.775 --> 01:10:34.936
Something you neglected to do,
Mr. Raman.

01:10:35.011 --> 01:10:37.241
Now each transfer
in excess of $10,000

01:10:37.313 --> 01:10:38.780
can be treated as a separate felony

01:10:38.848 --> 01:10:41.544
and each count is punishable
by up to five years in prison.

01:10:41.617 --> 01:10:43.084

You can do the math.
