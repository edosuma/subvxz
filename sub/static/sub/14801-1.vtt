00:50.816 --> 00:53.352
<i>I actually don't see myself
as being special,</i>

00:54.786 --> 00:56.320
<i>because I'm not.</i>

00:57.488 --> 00:58.523
<i>Not really.</i>

00:59.457 --> 01:01.460
These are green peppers.

01:02.726 --> 01:05.262
Sage.

01:05.296 --> 01:09.267
<i>So I try not to think about it and
I just go about living my life.</i>

01:09.299 --> 01:12.603
Look at this one.
See that? It's a nice one.

01:15.807 --> 01:18.277
<i>It's not something I'm ashamed
of or anything like that.</i>

01:19.777 --> 01:22.314
<i>But it's not something
I'm proud of, either.</i>

01:25.316 --> 01:27.385
<i>Because I had
nothing to do with it.</i>

01:29.453 --> 01:32.289
You don't get to choose
when you're born.

01:32.322 --> 01:34.458
<i>And as you can see here,
the waxing gibbous</i>

01:34.492 --> 01:36.561
<i>will be taking us
toward the weekend.</i>

01:36.593 --> 01:39.196
<i>And then on Saturday,
we'll have a full moon,</i>

01:39.230 --> 01:41.500
<i>and that's a perigee
for this orbit.</i>

01:41.533 --> 01:43.701
<i>So just keep that in mind as
you're planning your weekend.</i>

01:43.734 --> 01:47.338
<i>Family dinners may be a little
more quarrelsome than usual,</i>

01:47.371 --> 01:50.775
<i>especially if you've got some
menstruating teenagers around the table.</i>

01:50.808 --> 01:53.745
<i>Andrew's been working for us
for almost three years now.</i>

01:57.814 --> 02:00.751
<i>And I've really
come to value him.</i>

02:00.784 --> 02:02.853
-Hi, Andrew. Good morning.
-Good morning. Heading out?

02:02.887 --> 02:06.191
<i>Because he's good
at his job. It's that simple.</i>

02:06.224 --> 02:08.225
The lamp in my bedroom
needs a bulb.

02:08.258 --> 02:09.895
<i>-And the fact is...
-Okay, yeah, I can replace it.</i>

02:09.926 --> 02:12.663
a lot of people we know can't
find men to do the job anymore.

02:14.399 --> 02:16.735
So they're having
to hire women,

02:16.768 --> 02:18.704
which is obviously
a lot more expensive.

02:24.808 --> 02:26.578
-Good morning.
-Good morning!

02:26.610 --> 02:29.447
<i>Maybe it's because he is so
much younger than the other men</i>

02:29.479 --> 02:32.917
<i>we've had working for us,</i>

02:32.950 --> 02:36.587
<i>but I do worry about the impact
his presence has on our kids.</i>

02:37.588 --> 02:40.959
Really, you got a fever?

02:40.991 --> 02:44.562
It's not that I'm worried that he's
corrupting them or anything like that.

02:44.596 --> 02:48.400
It's more that having
a man like him around

02:48.432 --> 02:50.634
might make them
yearn for something

02:50.668 --> 02:52.570
they can't have...
Shouldn't have.

02:54.438 --> 02:58.310
I like the kids being exposed
to a man like Andrew.

02:58.342 --> 03:02.580
Someone who's more in his
prime, more vital and active.

03:02.614 --> 03:04.549
I think you're
gonna be late for school

03:04.581 --> 03:06.518
and you should go get ready.
What are you doing?

03:06.550 --> 03:09.753
<i>I mean, I know it's not
a very popular thing to say,</i>

03:09.787 --> 03:11.689
<i>but I think it's
enriching their lives.</i>

03:11.723 --> 03:12.724
Nine minutes.

03:12.757 --> 03:14.325
All our lives.

03:18.028 --> 03:21.466
Yeah, I suppose from a
historical point of view,

03:21.498 --> 03:22.600
there's some
truth to that.

03:24.868 --> 03:26.538
<i>Seventy-five years
from now,</i>

03:26.570 --> 03:28.606
<i>our daughters
will be able to give</i>

03:28.639 --> 03:30.975
<i>their daughters
and granddaughters</i>

03:31.008 --> 03:34.812
<i>a firsthand account
of what men were really like.</i>

03:34.846 --> 03:36.782
Yeah, I think
that's important.

03:40.685 --> 03:42.253
It's nature's way.

03:42.787 --> 03:44.289
Praise nature.

03:45.490 --> 03:48.627
<i>My name is Andrew Myers.</i>

03:48.659 --> 03:52.496
I am 37 years old, and I'm the
youngest man in the world.

03:56.759 --> 04:04.314
<b>NO MEN BEYOND THIS POINT</b>

04:05.030 --> 04:08.030
<b>Subrip: Pix</b>

04:11.816 --> 04:15.820
<i>In 1953 I was a young priest,
just out of the seminary.</i>

04:16.920 --> 04:18.522
<i>I was blessed
with the good fortune</i>

04:18.555 --> 04:20.457
<i>of being assigned
to the Vatican</i>

04:20.492 --> 04:24.463
<i>to work for an order known as the
Congregation of the Causes for Saints.</i>

04:26.997 --> 04:30.769
<i>It was our responsibility
to investigate events</i>

04:30.802 --> 04:34.539
<i>that were so extraordinary that they
could be deemed a divine miracle.</i>

04:36.040 --> 04:38.376
<i>Every year,
there were many claims made.</i>

04:38.408 --> 04:41.312
<i>Stigmatas, apparitions
of the Virgin Mary,</i>

04:41.346 --> 04:44.449
<i>the healing of
deadly medical conditions</i>

04:44.482 --> 04:46.652
<i>and, of course, virgin births.</i>

04:52.790 --> 04:54.459
<i>In a typical year,
there would be</i>

04:54.492 --> 04:56.927
<i>no more than
three or four reports</i>

04:56.961 --> 04:59.331
<i>of virgin births that
warranted any attention.</i>

05:01.699 --> 05:07.439
<i>But in 1953, there were
67 virgin birth claims.</i>

05:15.112 --> 05:17.682
<i>You have to remember
that fatherless pregnancies</i>

05:17.714 --> 05:20.551
<i>first began more
than half a century ago.</i>

05:20.584 --> 05:24.955
This is back when Abrahamic
religions dominated the world,

05:24.988 --> 05:29.126
and Christianity, which had nearly two
billion worshippers at that time,

05:29.160 --> 05:32.698
regarded virgin birth as one
of its most sacred tenets.

05:35.867 --> 05:39.403
<i>Christians believe
that a virgin named Mary</i>

05:39.437 --> 05:42.740
<i>gave birth to their Holy
Prophet, Jesus Christ,</i>

05:42.774 --> 05:45.476
<i>and that he was
fathered by their God.</i>

05:47.512 --> 05:50.514
So you can see why
the Church was so concerned

05:50.548 --> 05:53.884
about the sudden profusion
of virgin birth claims.

05:53.918 --> 05:57.889
Because if they were true, and the
Vatican could not prove otherwise,

05:59.023 --> 06:02.160
then they would have to be
considered miracles.

06:02.192 --> 06:06.497
Except miracles, by their very
nature, are extremely rare events.

06:09.600 --> 06:11.603
<i>Of course, it wasn't just
women who were virgins</i>

06:11.636 --> 06:13.905
<i>that were making these claims.</i>

06:13.937 --> 06:15.240
<i>All sorts of women
were coming forward.</i>

06:17.908 --> 06:21.712
But there was no way to
scientifically validate the claims.

06:21.745 --> 06:24.615
There was no DNA
testing back then,

06:24.649 --> 06:27.552
and the blood testing that
we did have could only prove

06:27.584 --> 06:29.753
that a particular man
wasn't the father,

06:29.786 --> 06:31.689
not that there was
no father at all.

06:35.927 --> 06:39.963
<i>You see, like all mammals,
humans could not procreate</i>

06:39.997 --> 06:43.033
<i>without intercourse
between a male and a female.</i>

06:43.067 --> 06:45.002
<i>It was
scientifically impossible.</i>

06:46.737 --> 06:48.939
So despite the growing
number of women

06:48.973 --> 06:51.509
making fatherless
pregnancy claims,

06:51.541 --> 06:54.779
the only logical conclusion
was that they were all lying.

06:59.250 --> 07:01.420
<i>My doctor was
the one who told me.</i>

07:02.653 --> 07:04.855
<i>That's how you
found out back then.</i>

07:04.889 --> 07:06.925
<i>This was 1953,</i>

07:06.958 --> 07:10.929
and I might have been young,
but I wasn't stupid.

07:10.961 --> 07:13.697
I knew the signs.
I felt awful.

07:15.699 --> 07:19.003
The problem was, there was no possible
way that I could be pregnant.

07:21.639 --> 07:24.542
<i>Richard, he was my husband,</i>

07:24.574 --> 07:26.911
<i>he insisted
that I get retested</i>

07:26.944 --> 07:28.747
<i>because he knew
the same thing I did.</i>

07:30.747 --> 07:32.584
<i>We hadn't been
intimate for over a year.</i>

07:35.920 --> 07:37.889
<i>As soon as
the doctor walked in,</i>

07:37.922 --> 07:38.990
<i>I knew what he
was going to say.</i>

07:40.891 --> 07:43.827
<i>That there was
no mistake with the test.</i>

07:43.860 --> 07:47.664
There was no mistake with the
test. Your wife is pregnant.

07:47.697 --> 07:50.032
<i>Richard demanded
to know who I'd been with.</i>

07:50.033 --> 07:52.170
Who were you with?
What's his name?

07:52.202 --> 07:53.971
<i>I swore to him
that I hadn't been unfaithful.</i>

07:54.004 --> 07:55.240
I haven't been
with anyone.

07:55.273 --> 07:56.674
<i>But he didn't believe me.</i>

07:56.706 --> 07:58.909
Of course, you have.
You're pregnant.

07:58.942 --> 08:02.846
<i>I tried to explain to the doctor
that this was impossible.</i>

08:02.879 --> 08:05.250
<i>He just looked at me
like I was a child.</i>

08:05.283 --> 08:10.088
Do you understand how procreation
works, how babies are made?

08:10.120 --> 08:12.956
You see, when a man and a woman
have sexual relations...

08:12.990 --> 08:15.927
It wasn't until 1988
that they had these tests

08:15.959 --> 08:18.662
that could show that
I was telling the truth,

08:18.696 --> 08:21.699
not that it mattered by
that point. It was obvious.

08:21.732 --> 08:22.968
But back then,

08:26.336 --> 08:27.805
<i>nobody believed me.</i>

08:33.644 --> 08:36.748
<i>The harder I tried to convince
people I was telling the truth,</i>

08:36.780 --> 08:39.616
<i>the crazier I seemed.</i>

08:39.649 --> 08:41.818
<i>And pretty soon, I began
to wonder if I was crazy.</i>

08:43.754 --> 08:46.758
How else could you explain
something like that?

08:46.791 --> 08:50.662
<i>It's outlandish.
Not even worth discussing.</i>

08:50.695 --> 08:53.598
<i>But, Senator, you must admit
these statistics are compelling.</i>

08:53.630 --> 08:55.567
<i>United States, 10,000 claims.</i>

08:55.600 --> 08:57.569
<i>Great Britain, 6,000 claims.</i>

08:57.601 --> 09:00.672
<i>India, 20,000 claims.</i>

09:00.705 --> 09:02.941
<i>Even Soviet women are claiming
to have become pregnant.</i>

09:02.974 --> 09:05.176
<i>We all know that women,
by nature,</i>

09:05.208 --> 09:08.045
<i>are very impressionable
and prone to hysterics.</i>

09:08.078 --> 09:10.614
<i>It's a known fact.</i>

09:10.648 --> 09:13.718
<i>Now perhaps the hormonal
changes involved in pregnancy</i>

09:13.750 --> 09:17.889
<i>amplify this hysteria
and their own gullibility.</i>

09:17.922 --> 09:22.026
<i>And then, you see, they hear about
another woman's bizarre claim</i>

09:22.058 --> 09:24.328
<i>about her pregnancy, and
suddenly they're all doing it.</i>

09:24.361 --> 09:28.832
<i>They cannot help themselves.
It becomes a fad.</i>

09:28.865 --> 09:33.937
Here we have the major developed
countries that existed at that time.

09:33.971 --> 09:36.941
<i>What's interesting is that
governments all over the world,</i>

09:36.974 --> 09:39.677
with every different kind
of political structure,

09:39.710 --> 09:42.080
remember this was
before unification,

09:42.113 --> 09:44.983
when faced with fatherless
pregnancy claims,

09:45.015 --> 09:47.918
they all reacted
the exact same way.

09:47.951 --> 09:50.721
<i>I've been very preoccupied with
other matters for a while.</i>

09:50.754 --> 09:52.356
<i>I'd have to ask
a little more time.</i>

09:52.389 --> 09:54.024
<i>Sir, will you
be able to have an opinion</i>

09:54.057 --> 09:55.994
<i>-a little later on?
-I'm not sure.</i>

09:56.027 --> 09:59.598
<i>It has certainly been
a surprising spectacle.</i>

10:01.231 --> 10:03.134
<i>They pretended like
it wasn't happening.</i>

10:05.403 --> 10:08.706
<i>But this is not so hard to
fathom when you consider that</i>

10:08.739 --> 10:12.009
<i>at that time, every one of those
governments was run by men.</i>

10:16.013 --> 10:19.850
<i>Personally, I can understand the
position the authorities took.</i>

10:19.884 --> 10:22.320
It would have been irresponsible
just to come out and say

10:22.352 --> 10:26.990
that a growing number of women were
procreating without male insemination.

10:27.024 --> 10:29.094
On the whole,
men are rational beings.

10:30.894 --> 10:33.730
But we have egos, too.

10:33.764 --> 10:36.801
And nobody likes being told
they're becoming obsolete.

10:52.216 --> 10:54.885
<i>Obviously,
it's not for everyone,</i>

10:54.918 --> 10:57.655
<i>but I still look forward to
going to work every morning.</i>

10:59.990 --> 11:01.826
<i>There's not a lot of guys
who can say that.</i>

11:03.226 --> 11:04.461
<i>Not anymore.</i>

11:05.929 --> 11:09.132
Come on,
I'm gonna tell Mommy.

11:09.166 --> 11:11.035
Come on, you.

11:11.067 --> 11:14.138
<i>There's lots of things
I like about him.</i>

11:14.171 --> 11:18.409
<i>He's fun to be around. And he's
caring, he's easy to talk to.</i>

11:18.442 --> 11:19.943
Andrew, I can't see.

11:19.976 --> 11:21.345
Okay, let's take a break.

11:21.378 --> 11:24.081
If we still had fathers,

11:24.115 --> 11:27.018
he'd definitely be the kind
I'd want for Violet.

11:29.052 --> 11:30.987
<i>What's that word
they used to say</i>

11:31.020 --> 11:32.456
<i>about a man who
looked appealing?</i>

11:32.490 --> 11:35.225
<i>Handser? Hands...</i>

11:35.259 --> 11:36.661
Handsome?

11:36.662 --> 11:38.062
Handsome. Yeah.

11:38.095 --> 11:40.264
Well, that's what they would
have said about Andrew.

11:40.297 --> 11:41.499
That he's handsome.

11:41.532 --> 11:43.367
Parasitism, competition

11:43.399 --> 11:44.802
and mutualism.

11:44.835 --> 11:46.370
Right there?

11:46.403 --> 11:50.341
<i>This is actually the third
household that I've worked in.</i>

11:50.374 --> 11:52.276
<i>And they've all
been different.</i>

11:52.308 --> 11:53.745
Describe species.

11:53.778 --> 11:54.912
Got some more bread.

11:54.945 --> 11:56.213
-Anyone want some?
-Thank you.

11:56.246 --> 11:58.348
<i>This one definitely
keeps me on my toes.</i>

11:58.381 --> 12:01.852
<i>There's six kids,
six months to 17.</i>

12:02.253 --> 12:04.756
<i>But that's okay.</i>

12:04.788 --> 12:07.759
<i>I prefer it that way.
It's better to stay busy.</i>

12:07.792 --> 12:10.927
I think someone's gonna go to
bed. So everyone say good night.

12:10.961 --> 12:12.831
-Good night, sweetheart.
-Good night.

12:19.537 --> 12:21.806
<i>What makes the job
a lot easier, though...</i>

12:21.839 --> 12:23.241
Hey, everybody,
gather in.

12:23.274 --> 12:26.244
<i>is when you genuinely like
the women that you work for.</i>

12:26.277 --> 12:27.979
Okay, is everybody here?

12:28.011 --> 12:29.312
Hey, Luna,
how's it going?

12:29.346 --> 12:30.280
-Hi, Violet.
-Hey.

12:30.313 --> 12:32.382
Doesn't look like
you're gonna be cold today.

12:32.416 --> 12:35.286
<i>Iris is
really easygoing and kind.</i>

12:38.154 --> 12:42.793
<i>And she has this
way about her that...</i>

12:42.826 --> 12:44.961
Balls,
we need balls.

12:44.995 --> 12:46.130
<i>It's hard to describe.</i>

12:47.565 --> 12:48.866
See your sister? Hi!

12:48.899 --> 12:50.033
Over here.

12:52.001 --> 12:54.304
All I know is that when
I'm around her, I feel

12:57.307 --> 12:58.176
at ease.

12:59.509 --> 13:01.044
Saffron, move in!

13:02.546 --> 13:04.415
<i>Terra's more conservative.</i>

13:07.183 --> 13:09.920
<i>She likes to do things
by the book.</i>

13:09.953 --> 13:12.455
Remember the play, girls,
just like in practice!

13:12.489 --> 13:17.228
<i>So when she's around,
I tend to keep a low profile.</i>

13:17.260 --> 13:19.363
<i>I do my job,
and I stay out of the way.</i>

13:20.998 --> 13:22.533
Because at the end
of the day,

13:22.566 --> 13:25.469
no matter how emotionally
involved I might get,

13:25.501 --> 13:26.702
I'm an employee.

13:28.538 --> 13:31.408
And it's good to be reminded
of that every once in a while.

13:31.442 --> 13:33.577
There he is,
the whippersnapper.

13:33.610 --> 13:35.545
-Hey, Jim, how are you?
-Good, good.

13:35.578 --> 13:36.646
You know Reggie?

13:36.679 --> 13:39.182
He works for Holly Dawson
and Ivy Chan up on Verona.

13:39.216 --> 13:41.284
Sure, yeah.

13:41.317 --> 13:43.920
And my bosses want me to put
on a magic show to boot.

13:43.953 --> 13:45.355
Can you believe that?

13:45.389 --> 13:48.058
As if I can just
summon up balloon animals.

13:48.091 --> 13:52.263
I want to say, "Ladies, I put on a
magic show for you every single day.

13:52.296 --> 13:54.465
"I toilet trained your
daughters, for God's sake."

13:55.633 --> 13:57.134
Excuse me?

13:57.167 --> 13:58.603
Can you keep
your voices down?

13:58.635 --> 14:01.338
Nobody wants to listen
to a bunch of manosaurs.

14:03.506 --> 14:05.508
It's so annoying.

14:05.542 --> 14:07.211
Sorry, we were just talking.

14:07.244 --> 14:08.512
Yeah, relax.

14:08.544 --> 14:10.080
Don't tell me to relax.

14:10.114 --> 14:11.615
You're not even
allowed to be here.

14:11.649 --> 14:12.950
It's okay,
we're actually working.

14:12.982 --> 14:14.451
It doesn't matter.

14:14.485 --> 14:16.519
You can't congregate
in groups of more than two.

14:16.552 --> 14:17.889
Or have you
forgotten that?

14:17.922 --> 14:19.490
Come on,
seriously?

14:19.523 --> 14:21.158
Those are the rules.

14:21.191 --> 14:23.594
Are you going to
follow them or not?

14:23.626 --> 14:25.295
It's okay. I got to
get back to work.

14:25.328 --> 14:26.830
No, no. Don't go.
Stick around.

14:26.864 --> 14:29.934
It's okay. It's not worth it. It was
good seeing you. I'll see you soon.

14:29.966 --> 14:31.235
See you later.

14:36.440 --> 14:38.142
<i>Maybe if things
had turned out differently,</i>

14:38.174 --> 14:41.011
<i>I'd be a pilot
or an architect like my mom.</i>

14:43.413 --> 14:47.350
<i>But there's no point
in dwelling on that.</i>

14:47.384 --> 14:50.153
<i>I'm gonna make the best of the
opportunities that I do have,</i>

14:51.388 --> 14:54.024
<i>because things
aren't going to change.</i>

14:54.991 --> 14:56.461
<i>Not back to the way they were.</i>

14:59.495 --> 15:01.331
That's just
a fact of nature.

15:10.106 --> 15:12.375
<i>Even though more and more
women were coming forward</i>

15:12.408 --> 15:13.944
<i>with fatherless
pregnancy claims,</i>

15:13.977 --> 15:17.247
<i>they weren't taken seriously.</i>

15:17.280 --> 15:20.183
<i>So things seemed to carry on
as they always had.</i>

15:23.052 --> 15:24.956
<i>I think there was a sense
that it was pointless.</i>

15:26.590 --> 15:28.392
<i>We tried to tell them
what was going on,</i>

15:28.424 --> 15:30.127
<i>but they didn't
want to listen.</i>

15:32.062 --> 15:34.698
They never listened.

15:34.731 --> 15:37.701
But if you'd looked a little
closer, you would have seen that

15:37.735 --> 15:42.706
<i>beneath the women's dutiful,
prim and proper exteriors,</i>

15:42.740 --> 15:46.510
<i>there was a simmering anger
getting ready to boil over.</i>

15:48.312 --> 15:50.414
And then Sister Isabella
came along.

15:55.385 --> 15:58.355
<i>She was living in
a convent in the hills</i>

15:58.389 --> 16:01.024
<i>outside of a small town
in Northern Spain.</i>

16:02.592 --> 16:06.062
<i>Men were strictly forbidden
from entering the convent,</i>

16:06.096 --> 16:09.366
<i>and even if she had wanted
to break her vows,</i>

16:09.399 --> 16:12.669
<i>given the remote location and the
watchfulness of the other nuns,</i>

16:12.702 --> 16:15.238
<i>it would have been impossible
for her to sneak away.</i>

16:17.240 --> 16:20.477
<i>Yet, Sister Isabella discovered,
to her utter dismay</i>

16:23.780 --> 16:25.582
<i>that she was pregnant.</i>

16:29.219 --> 16:32.790
<i>One could argue that if this had
happened in a different time,</i>

16:32.822 --> 16:36.192
<i>the Church may have very well
embraced Sister Isabella,</i>

16:36.225 --> 16:38.361
<i>canonized her
as a living saint,</i>

16:38.394 --> 16:40.497
<i>and perhaps even
looked upon her baby</i>

16:40.530 --> 16:42.265
<i>as the return
of their Messiah.</i>

16:43.533 --> 16:45.602
But then again,
she had a daughter,

16:45.635 --> 16:47.170
so that would
have thrown a wrench

16:47.203 --> 16:49.072
into the Biblical narrative,
wouldn't it?

16:54.677 --> 16:57.380
<i>All we do know is
that the Church wanted</i>

16:57.413 --> 16:59.484
<i>nothing to do
with Sister Isabella.</i>

17:02.119 --> 17:05.155
<i>The Congregation of Causes of
Saints was ordered to destroy</i>

17:05.189 --> 17:06.590
<i>the report they had written,</i>

17:08.156 --> 17:10.527
<i>and deny that they had
ever heard her claim.</i>

17:16.500 --> 17:18.769
<i>They told us
it was for the best.</i>

17:25.776 --> 17:27.845
<i>In the tiny village
of Burgos, Spain,</i>

17:27.877 --> 17:29.646
<i>a group of nuns are
telling a whale of a story.</i>

17:30.780 --> 17:32.817
<i>Meet Sister Isabella.</i>

17:32.849 --> 17:36.686
<i>Though it's hard to tell with
that habit on, she's pregnant.</i>

17:36.720 --> 17:38.689
<i>And guess who they're
saying the father is?</i>

17:38.721 --> 17:40.289
<i>No one.</i>

17:40.324 --> 17:43.827
<i>That's right, it's another
so-called fatherless pregnancy.</i>

17:43.861 --> 17:46.330
<i>The last thing the Catholic
Church expected was that</i>

17:46.363 --> 17:51.434
a devout order of Spanish nuns would
not only break their vow of silence,

17:51.468 --> 17:54.072
but start talking to
anyone who would listen.

18:05.315 --> 18:08.285
<i>You people think that this
is a joke, but it is not.</i>

18:08.317 --> 18:12.655
<i>It is happening more and more, and the
government needs to acknowledge it.</i>

18:12.689 --> 18:15.292
<i>They need to wake up and
take these claims seriously</i>

18:15.325 --> 18:17.595
<i>or they are going to be sorry.</i>

18:17.627 --> 18:20.330
<i>We would like women
everywhere to know</i>

18:20.364 --> 18:22.766
<i>that despite the world's
scientific community</i>

18:22.798 --> 18:25.502
<i>being unanimous
in their belief</i>

18:25.536 --> 18:27.605
<i>that fatherless pregnancies
are impossible,</i>

18:27.637 --> 18:30.607
<i>we intend to study
this matter vigorously.</i>

18:30.641 --> 18:34.311
<i>And I have no doubt that,
one way or another,</i>

18:34.344 --> 18:37.582
<i>we will be able to put this whole
matter to rest once and for all.</i>

18:42.752 --> 18:45.588
<i>For as long as history has
been recorded we have seen,</i>

18:45.622 --> 18:48.491
<i>with civilization
after civilization,</i>

18:48.525 --> 18:51.162
<i>that once
a group attains power,</i>

18:51.194 --> 18:53.730
<i>they are very
reluctant to give it up.</i>

18:53.763 --> 18:58.168
But history also shows us that
eventually they are always forced to.

18:59.435 --> 19:01.638
<i>Tell us what you saw earlier.</i>

19:01.672 --> 19:04.208
<i>Well, really it's
what I didn't see.</i>

19:04.240 --> 19:07.177
<i>When I came into work this morning,
there were no secretaries,</i>

19:07.211 --> 19:09.613
<i>which is unusual, given
how many of them we have.</i>

19:09.645 --> 19:11.781
<i>And since there was no one
to make me coffee,</i>

19:11.815 --> 19:13.750
<i>I had to go all the way
down to the lobby.</i>

19:13.784 --> 19:16.287
<i>But then it took me
20 minutes to get service</i>

19:16.319 --> 19:18.955
<i>because the waitresses hadn't
shown up for work there, either.</i>

19:18.989 --> 19:21.525
Afterwards, it was
referred to as a strike.

19:21.557 --> 19:24.361
But it wasn't
an organized event.

19:24.394 --> 19:27.431
My mother wasn't even aware that other
women were doing the same thing.

19:28.531 --> 19:31.568
One night, she just decided
that she'd had enough.

19:35.672 --> 19:37.607
<i>My father and brother and I
were in the dining room</i>

19:37.641 --> 19:39.710
<i>waiting for
dinner to be served.</i>

19:39.742 --> 19:42.579
<i>And I noticed she
wasn't in the kitchen.</i>

19:42.613 --> 19:44.548
<i>And it didn't seem like
any food was being prepared.</i>

19:46.250 --> 19:49.619
<i>Then she appeared with a coat on and
her purse in her hand and said...</i>

19:49.653 --> 19:51.555
I'm going out.

19:51.587 --> 19:53.824
I don't know
when I'll be back.

19:53.856 --> 19:56.793
If you want dinner, you'll
have to make it yourselves.

19:56.826 --> 20:00.730
I think there's some
ground beef in the freezer.

20:00.763 --> 20:02.532
<i>And it was really
out of character for her</i>

20:02.566 --> 20:03.300
<i>to be doing
something like that.</i>

20:05.001 --> 20:08.838
<i>But it wasn't until I turned and
saw the look on my father's face</i>

20:08.872 --> 20:12.343
<i>that I realized that something
significant was happening.</i>

20:22.385 --> 20:25.990
I have to admit, I was impressed that
he was able to swallow his pride

20:26.022 --> 20:27.791
and ask me
to take him back.

20:29.893 --> 20:33.364
<i>But then I suddenly
had this realization</i>

20:35.298 --> 20:38.536
<i>that I had absolutely
no use for him in my life.</i>

20:49.746 --> 20:52.850
<i>I love
everything Iris paints.</i>

20:55.885 --> 20:57.587
<i>I always have.</i>

20:59.522 --> 21:03.461
<i>But I'm biased,
because we're so close.</i>

21:05.561 --> 21:08.031
And when you
really like someone,

21:08.065 --> 21:10.301
you tend to like
everything they do.

21:12.435 --> 21:15.538
Am I as crazy about
this man phase she's been in?

21:16.673 --> 21:18.608
Maybe not.

21:18.642 --> 21:20.811
But they're still
beautiful paintings.

21:34.825 --> 21:38.528
<i>I don't think people
acknowledge the issue enough.</i>

21:38.561 --> 21:40.363
<i>I mean, most don't
acknowledge it at all.</i>

21:42.098 --> 21:47.538
<i>But manlessness is something
that really concerns me,</i>

21:47.570 --> 21:50.674
<i>which, I guess, is why I've been making
it such a part of my work lately.</i>

21:52.776 --> 21:55.778
Because I want to
keep the issue alive.

21:55.811 --> 21:59.416
I guess it's my way of making
people confront what's going on.

22:16.799 --> 22:19.903
<i>The paintings don't sell nearly
as well as my other pieces.</i>

22:22.172 --> 22:24.975
Actually,
they don't sell at all.

22:25.008 --> 22:27.877
Nobody wants a picture of a man
hanging over their fireplace.

22:36.519 --> 22:39.789
<i>It isn't Andrew's age
and what that represents.</i>

22:40.824 --> 22:43.494
<i>He just...</i>

22:43.527 --> 22:46.529
He has this way
about him that I like.

22:50.634 --> 22:53.938
<i>I notice her staring at him a
lot, but it kind of makes sense.</i>

22:55.806 --> 22:58.174
If you're gonna spend all
that time painting someone,

22:58.208 --> 23:00.945
you should probably
really like looking at them.

23:05.481 --> 23:06.817
You think I'm
obsessed with him.

23:07.550 --> 23:09.552
I'm not.

23:09.586 --> 23:11.389
It's just part
of my process.

23:16.058 --> 23:18.628
<i>It doesn't matter
what my subject is.</i>

23:18.662 --> 23:21.030
It's good.

23:21.064 --> 23:22.065
Are you being serious?

23:22.066 --> 23:23.066
Yeah, it's good.

23:23.098 --> 23:26.736
And it's not like there's a lot of
other men around for me to paint.

23:28.003 --> 23:29.740
And he does live with us.

23:36.179 --> 23:37.648
Here is it.

23:38.615 --> 23:40.951
I did it for art class...

23:42.952 --> 23:44.954
It's not perfect
or anything.

23:46.088 --> 23:48.692
I wasn't concerned
with likeness so much.

23:48.724 --> 23:50.794
I was more
interested in his body,

23:52.628 --> 23:54.998
his muscles,
especially in his arms.

23:56.900 --> 23:58.736
I really like his arms.

24:05.509 --> 24:08.010
My grandma used to say
about my grandfather

24:08.044 --> 24:09.913
that it wasn't his looks

24:09.945 --> 24:12.582
or even his personality that
caught her attention at first,

24:12.615 --> 24:15.152
it was his spirit.

24:15.184 --> 24:18.254
And that's what I'm trying
to capture in my paintings,

24:18.288 --> 24:20.891
Andrew's spirit.

24:20.923 --> 24:25.028
And maybe, by extension, the
spirit that exists in all men.

24:29.965 --> 24:34.003
<i>As the number of fatherless
pregnancy claims continued to rise,</i>

24:34.037 --> 24:37.140
<i>we discovered that the number
of normal pregnancies,</i>

24:37.173 --> 24:41.278
<i>in which a man impregnated
a woman, was plummeting.</i>

24:41.310 --> 24:45.548
<i>In fact, by the end of 1957,
three out of four babies born</i>

24:45.582 --> 24:47.584
<i>were coming from
mothers claiming</i>

24:47.616 --> 24:49.853
<i>to have had
a fatherless impregnation.</i>

24:49.885 --> 24:52.955
What was even
more alarming, though,

24:52.989 --> 24:56.927
was the fact that every one of those
mothers gave birth to a girl.

25:02.097 --> 25:04.867
Parthenogenesis.

25:04.901 --> 25:06.737
It's the reason
why we get called.

25:06.769 --> 25:08.271
You know,
instead of how it used to be

25:08.305 --> 25:10.207
when you needed to be
with a man to get pregnant.

25:11.974 --> 25:13.142
What? It's true.

25:13.175 --> 25:15.979
That's disgusting.

25:16.011 --> 25:19.782
Parthenogenesis is a form
of asexual reproduction

25:19.816 --> 25:22.318
<i>in which an egg is the sole
source of genetic material</i>

25:22.352 --> 25:23.653
<i>for the creation of an embryo.</i>

25:25.922 --> 25:29.159
<i>But this mode of reproduction
was only known to occur</i>

25:29.192 --> 25:31.628
<i>with insects and
certain types of reptiles.</i>

25:34.663 --> 25:36.567
<i>With mammals, however,</i>

25:38.367 --> 25:41.971
<i>an embryo could only develop if the
egg had been fertilized by a male,</i>

25:43.740 --> 25:48.845
<i>bringing together the genetic
components that make life possible.</i>

25:48.877 --> 25:52.648
But with parthenogenesis, since
all the necessary components

25:52.682 --> 25:55.553
needed for reproduction
are produced by the egg,

25:57.319 --> 26:00.657
<i>sperm are rendered obsolete.</i>

26:02.659 --> 26:04.361
Not only that,
but we discovered

26:04.394 --> 26:06.931
the sperm could no longer
penetrate the wall of the egg.

26:08.298 --> 26:12.603
<i>It was producing a new protein
that hardened the membrane.</i>

26:12.635 --> 26:15.138
<i>The sperm were
literally being shut out.</i>

26:18.842 --> 26:22.145
<i>Even when a sperm was injected
into the egg artificially,</i>

26:22.178 --> 26:24.815
<i>it was almost immediately
rendered inert.</i>

26:34.824 --> 26:38.260
When you take sperm out of
the biological equation,

26:38.294 --> 26:40.364
there are no longer
any Y chromosomes

26:40.396 --> 26:42.865
<i>being introduced
into the embryonic process.</i>

26:45.067 --> 26:49.639
<i>So every embryo has two X chromosomes
and every child is female.</i>

26:51.407 --> 26:52.642
<i>And thus,</i>

26:53.442 --> 26:54.979
no more males.

27:01.317 --> 27:04.020
<i>It wasn't hard for them to figure
out that I was the last one.</i>

27:06.890 --> 27:10.761
<i>I was actually the only boy born
that year in the entire world.</i>

27:13.762 --> 27:17.033
But they didn't make it official
until a few years later,

27:17.067 --> 27:19.903
when they were sure that there
wasn't any more of us coming.

27:23.873 --> 27:26.076
<i>When I started school,
I got a lot of attention.</i>

27:27.911 --> 27:29.913
<i>I was kind of
like the class pet.</i>

27:31.013 --> 27:33.315
<i>Not in a bad way.</i>

27:33.348 --> 27:36.787
<i>It wasn't like I was being
kept in a cage like Mr. Chips.</i>

27:38.922 --> 27:40.790
He was
the actual class pet.

27:43.326 --> 27:46.762
<i>High school was
more of a challenge.</i>

27:46.796 --> 27:49.432
<i>By that point, girls were so
used to not having boys around</i>

27:49.465 --> 27:53.803
<i>that the idea of being attracted to
one was completely alien to them.</i>

27:56.205 --> 27:59.075
Don't get me wrong,
there were some crooked girls,

27:59.108 --> 28:00.810
more than there
are now, I'm sure.

28:02.412 --> 28:06.482
<i>But they weren't
accepted by the other girls.</i>

28:06.516 --> 28:09.720
<i>But neither was I,
so we got along just fine.</i>

28:13.088 --> 28:15.791
<i>It really wasn't until
I finished high school</i>

28:15.825 --> 28:18.260
<i>that I realized how different
things were going to be for me,</i>

28:18.294 --> 28:21.798
<i>compared to
the girls I graduated with.</i>

28:21.830 --> 28:24.734
That's when it
finally dawned on me that

28:24.768 --> 28:28.471
I wasn't gonna have the same
opportunities that they were going to.

28:28.505 --> 28:30.741
They were going
down one road

28:32.442 --> 28:34.243
and I was going down another.

28:39.348 --> 28:42.485
<i>I, Eleanor Marie Hamilton,
do solemnly swear...</i>

28:42.519 --> 28:44.820
<i>That I
will faithfully execute...</i>

28:44.854 --> 28:46.456
<i>That I will
faithfully execute...</i>

28:46.489 --> 28:49.392
<i>The office of the President
of the United States.</i>

28:49.424 --> 28:51.494
<i>The office of the President
of the United States.</i>

28:51.528 --> 28:53.329
<i>And with the best
of my ability...</i>

28:53.363 --> 28:57.366
<i>If you had told someone
in the early 1960s</i>

28:57.400 --> 29:01.304
<i>that a woman would be the next
President of the United States,</i>

29:01.336 --> 29:02.972
<i>they wouldn't
have believed you.</i>

29:04.173 --> 29:06.910
It may seem ridiculous now,
but at that time,

29:06.942 --> 29:10.413
people thought they'd have to wait
10, or possibly even 15 years,

29:10.445 --> 29:12.515
before that would happen.

29:12.548 --> 29:17.287
The changes weren't that
drastic, at least not at first.

29:17.319 --> 29:19.522
It's not like they came out
and declared war on men

29:19.556 --> 29:21.557
or anything like that.

29:21.590 --> 29:24.160
But I don't think it
would be a stretch to say

29:24.193 --> 29:26.395
that there was
an element of payback

29:26.429 --> 29:29.332
in their governing agenda.

29:29.365 --> 29:32.402
<i>We very much appreciate
the historical contribution</i>

29:32.434 --> 29:35.070
<i>that men have made
to our civilization.</i>

29:35.104 --> 29:37.407
<i>But the facts are the facts.</i>

29:37.440 --> 29:40.544
<i>Women make up 62% of the
population. And that...</i>

29:40.576 --> 29:42.546
<i>Actually, Senator,
it's 64% now.</i>

29:42.578 --> 29:44.248
<i>Right.</i>

29:44.280 --> 29:47.983
<i>And that ratio needs to be represented
in all levels of society.</i>

29:48.017 --> 29:50.120
<i>But isn't your
worker replacement program</i>

29:50.153 --> 29:51.855
<i>a little harsh?
These statistics...</i>

29:51.887 --> 29:53.589
<i>Worker assessment program.</i>

29:53.623 --> 29:57.294
<i>We only allow male
employees to be replaced</i>

29:57.326 --> 30:00.096
<i>if, after a very
thorough assessment,</i>

30:00.128 --> 30:02.298
<i>they are deemed
to be less capable</i>

30:02.332 --> 30:04.568
<i>than an equally
qualified female.</i>

30:04.601 --> 30:08.138
<i>It's simply
a weeding out process.</i>

30:08.171 --> 30:10.807
<i>And there just happens
to be a lot of weeds.</i>

30:15.278 --> 30:18.280
<i>My grandfather, he warned
that this would happen.</i>

30:18.314 --> 30:21.250
<i>He said we never should
have given women the vote.</i>

30:21.284 --> 30:24.988
<i>He said, "You give them an inch,
and they'll take your soul."</i>

30:25.020 --> 30:27.191
<i>You know what?
He was right.</i>

30:31.594 --> 30:33.630
<i>Generally speaking,
men did not</i>

30:33.663 --> 30:35.932
<i>react well to
female-led governments.</i>

30:35.964 --> 30:39.368
<i>More and more of
them began to opt out</i>

30:39.402 --> 30:43.874
and move to rural encampments in what
we now refer to as "the Exodus."

30:45.375 --> 30:48.945
<i>We are not welcome here,
so why stay?</i>

30:49.578 --> 30:51.347
<i>You know?</i>

30:51.381 --> 30:54.351
<i>We'll see how they
get along without us,</i>

30:54.384 --> 30:56.185
<i>because I don't think
it's going to be too long</i>

30:56.219 --> 30:59.588
<i>before they realize the mistake they
made and then beg us to come back.</i>

30:59.622 --> 31:01.490
<i>Hey, jackass!</i>

31:01.523 --> 31:03.225
<i>You forgot your coat.</i>

31:03.259 --> 31:05.261
<i>Kind of an important
item to leave behind</i>

31:05.295 --> 31:06.897
<i>when you're gonna
live in the woods.</i>

31:14.002 --> 31:16.673
<i>I was living
with these three women,</i>

31:16.705 --> 31:19.141
<i>and they were all
beautiful and free loving.</i>

31:20.476 --> 31:23.647
<i>Then they started treating me
like a sex object</i>

31:23.680 --> 31:25.315
<i>and their errand boy.</i>

31:31.688 --> 31:34.090
<i>By the mid-1970s,
it was clear</i>

31:34.123 --> 31:37.260
<i>that women were doing just
fine without men in charge.</i>

31:41.431 --> 31:44.201
<i>This caused a lot of the men who had
left to rethink their positions.</i>

31:47.135 --> 31:50.272
<i>Some returned and took on
more subservient roles.</i>

31:50.306 --> 31:53.309
But a core group
dug in their heels

31:53.343 --> 31:56.579
and refused to accept
the new world order.

31:56.612 --> 32:00.483
<i>It's simple, okay?
Power, respect.</i>

32:00.516 --> 32:02.419
<i>That's what's been
taken away from us,</i>

32:02.451 --> 32:05.321
<i>and that's what we
intend to get back.</i>

32:05.355 --> 32:09.459
<i>It's not called "womankind."
It's called "mankind."</i>

32:09.491 --> 32:11.161
<i>And there's a reason for that,</i>

32:11.193 --> 32:14.463
<i>because for
the last 200,000 years,</i>

32:14.497 --> 32:17.467
<i>men have been keeping
civilization afloat.</i>

32:17.500 --> 32:21.403
<i>We've been steering the ship.
We built the ship.</i>

32:21.436 --> 32:23.439
<i>And now they want
to chuck us overboard</i>

32:23.472 --> 32:24.974
<i>because their eggs
have gone haywire?</i>

32:25.607 --> 32:27.443
<i>Not bloody likely.</i>

32:27.477 --> 32:29.312
<i>-What do we want?
-Respect!</i>

32:29.345 --> 32:30.747
<i>-When do we want it?
-Now!</i>

32:30.779 --> 32:32.315
<i>-What do we want?
-Respect!</i>

32:32.347 --> 32:33.915
<i>-When do we want it?
-Now!</i>

32:33.950 --> 32:36.653
<i>The protests tied up traffic
throughout the city,</i>

32:36.685 --> 32:39.655
<i>which is believed to be what
ultimately sparked the violence.</i>

32:39.689 --> 32:41.591
<i>Women just started
getting out of their cars</i>

32:41.624 --> 32:43.727
<i>and coming at us with this...
This look in their eyes.</i>

32:46.796 --> 32:48.431
<i>Get out of the street!</i>

32:48.464 --> 32:53.068
<i>I was trying to get to work, but
the traffic was stopped dead.</i>

32:53.102 --> 32:56.306
<i>And then I saw the men blocking
the road and chanting.</i>

32:57.606 --> 32:59.175
<i>And I snapped.</i>

33:03.779 --> 33:06.182
<i>Protest marches took place
all over the world that day.</i>

33:09.652 --> 33:13.623
At first, it was thought that the violence
was connected to parthenogenesis.

33:13.655 --> 33:17.059
That nature was compensating
for the loss of men

33:17.093 --> 33:19.662
by making women
more aggressive.

33:19.694 --> 33:21.365
But in fact,
it was PMS.

33:24.500 --> 33:26.769
<i>By 1975,
women represented</i>

33:26.803 --> 33:30.740
<i>over three-quarters
of the world's population.</i>

33:30.772 --> 33:34.576
<i>This triggered what's known as
"menstrual ovulatory synchrony,"</i>

33:34.609 --> 33:36.144
<i>which is a phenomenon</i>

33:36.178 --> 33:41.051
<i>where the menstrual cycles of
women become synchronized.</i>

33:41.084 --> 33:44.321
So essentially, the world became
like one big sorority house.

33:45.621 --> 33:47.391
<i>This is just
the tip of the iceberg.</i>

33:48.458 --> 33:50.692
<i>First their bodies
get in sync.</i>

33:50.726 --> 33:53.063
<i>Pretty soon,
it'll be their minds.</i>

33:54.163 --> 33:56.133
<i>Telepathic communication.</i>

33:57.165 --> 33:59.134
<i>How do you contend with that?</i>

33:59.167 --> 34:01.203
<i>You can't.</i>

34:01.237 --> 34:03.206
<i>You can't compete
with the hive mind.</i>

34:06.108 --> 34:08.677
<i>The protest marches
and the ensuing violence</i>

34:08.710 --> 34:11.347
<i>turned out to be
a watershed event.</i>

34:11.380 --> 34:13.782
It was the catalyst
for creating a monthly,

34:13.815 --> 34:17.820
three-day statutory holiday
we now know as "Menses."

34:17.853 --> 34:22.291
But more importantly, the protests
happened right after unification.

34:22.858 --> 34:24.661
So it was the first test

34:24.693 --> 34:27.831
for the newly formed
World Governing Council.

34:27.864 --> 34:32.501
<i>And everyone was watching very closely
to see how they would respond.</i>

34:32.534 --> 34:35.105
<i>First of all,
I want to make it clear</i>

34:35.137 --> 34:39.409
<i>that the World Governing
Council, above all, listens.</i>

34:39.442 --> 34:43.480
<i>We want men's groups everywhere
to know we have heard you.</i>

34:43.512 --> 34:46.348
<i>We acknowledge your plight
and we're going to help you.</i>

34:47.750 --> 34:49.485
<i>As part of our commitment</i>

34:49.518 --> 34:53.288
<i>to ensuring the safety
and comfort of men everywhere,</i>

34:53.322 --> 34:57.427
<i>the World Governing Council has
set aside vast areas of land</i>

34:57.460 --> 35:01.865
<i>for the creation
of male sanctuaries.</i>

35:01.898 --> 35:06.336
<i>These exclusive communities will
be located all over the world,</i>

35:06.369 --> 35:09.372
<i>including the entire
continent of Australia.</i>

35:11.507 --> 35:13.876
<i>Men who live in these
sanctuaries will be provided</i>

35:13.909 --> 35:18.614
<i>all the services they require,
including medical attention,</i>

35:18.648 --> 35:21.483
<i>nutritious meals,
clean clothes,</i>

35:21.516 --> 35:24.120
<i>and of course, entertainment.</i>

35:31.494 --> 35:33.363
<i>We believe that
the remaining men</i>

35:33.396 --> 35:35.265
<i>should be kept as
comfortable as possible</i>

35:35.297 --> 35:36.899
<i>as they live out their lives.</i>

35:36.932 --> 35:39.635
<i>And that their
contribution to humanity</i>

35:39.668 --> 35:43.338
<i>must be, and will be,
respected and honored.</i>

35:43.371 --> 35:48.344
<i>But, at the same time, we must
respect and honor nature's actions.</i>

35:48.376 --> 35:49.579
<i>Praise nature.</i>

35:51.447 --> 35:53.782
<i>Do they think we're children?</i>

35:53.815 --> 35:57.719
<i>Offering us food and a bunch
of silly conveniences.</i>

35:57.753 --> 36:01.291
<i>It is a blatant attempt by this
female regime to pacify us.</i>

36:02.224 --> 36:03.860
<i>We're not stupid.</i>

36:03.893 --> 36:06.663
<i>They can ply us with
all the comforts in the world,</i>

36:06.695 --> 36:09.898
<i>but it will not
change our resolve.</i>

36:09.931 --> 36:14.236
<i>Because they may have taken away
our rightful place in society.</i>

36:14.269 --> 36:17.606
<i>They will not take
away our dignity.</i>

36:17.639 --> 36:20.609
While there's no question
the MLO had a defiant spirit

36:20.643 --> 36:23.713
and were very vocal
about their intentions,

36:23.746 --> 36:26.749
they actually didn't do much
once the Governing Council

36:26.782 --> 36:30.353
established the sanctuaries
and began providing services.

36:30.385 --> 36:31.853
<i>That's rubbish.</i>

36:31.887 --> 36:34.824
<i>Living in the sanctuaries
has not made us weak.</i>

36:34.856 --> 36:38.594
<i>What it has done is given us the
ability to plan our resurgence</i>

36:38.628 --> 36:40.997
<i>as the dominant,
superior sex</i>

36:41.030 --> 36:44.334
<i>without the hassle of having to prepare
meals or take care of ourselves.</i>

36:49.871 --> 36:52.975
<i>Don't you see?
The joke is on them.</i>

36:53.009 --> 36:55.577
All this time,
the regime have believed

36:55.610 --> 36:57.980
that they've been
weakening our resolve.

36:58.014 --> 37:00.849
But what they've actually
been doing is allowing us

37:00.882 --> 37:03.518
to focus on our
plan of attack.

37:03.552 --> 37:06.322
And it won't be long
before we're ready to strike.

37:06.355 --> 37:08.625
I don't think the issue
is whether or not

37:08.657 --> 37:11.027
the MLO is
an effective organization.

37:11.059 --> 37:13.829
It's the fact that their central
goal can't be achieved.

37:15.030 --> 37:17.500
Not when the government
firmly believes

37:17.532 --> 37:19.601
that there's no solution
to the problem.

37:19.635 --> 37:21.771
They don't even see
manlessness as a problem.

37:23.005 --> 37:26.409
To them, it's simply
an evolutionary event,

37:26.442 --> 37:28.510
an act of nature
that's beyond our control

37:28.543 --> 37:30.612
and should
never be questioned,

37:30.646 --> 37:33.583
because nature is sacred.

37:33.615 --> 37:36.853
Notice the energy
rising up your body,

37:36.885 --> 37:39.922
higher and higher.

37:39.954 --> 37:43.559
Feel the power flowing up
through your fingertips.

37:47.797 --> 37:49.999
Breathe it in.

37:50.032 --> 37:52.934
<i>It wasn't enough
that they took away our jobs.</i>

37:52.967 --> 37:54.903
<i>They went and fired God, too.</i>

37:54.936 --> 38:00.576
Worshipping the sacred
cycles of her forces.

38:00.608 --> 38:02.612
<i>Replaced him with a sheila.</i>

38:02.644 --> 38:05.581
That's nature
flowing through you.

38:05.614 --> 38:07.884
Praise nature.

38:07.916 --> 38:10.519
But you can't
question her actions,

38:10.552 --> 38:12.688
because everything she does
is a blessed gift.

38:13.588 --> 38:16.058
Influenza was
an act of nature.

38:16.092 --> 38:18.528
So was malaria and cancer.

38:21.097 --> 38:23.766
<i>But they're not
around anymore.</i>

38:23.798 --> 38:26.735
<i>And not because
nature eradicated them,</i>

38:26.768 --> 38:30.572
<i>but because the government spent trillions
of dollars developing vaccines.</i>

38:31.974 --> 38:34.943
I'm not suggesting that the
Governing Council has been

38:34.976 --> 38:37.612
avoiding dealing with the
manlessness issue on purpose

38:37.646 --> 38:40.083
as a way
to maintain power,

38:40.115 --> 38:43.820
even though having men die off
would certainly achieve that goal.

38:43.853 --> 38:45.789
But I do think it's
worth asking the question.

38:46.956 --> 38:49.793
Why haven't more resources
been put towards it?

38:51.460 --> 38:54.697
There's no doubt in my mind
that the government have been

38:54.730 --> 38:57.432
deliberately
ignoring the problem.

38:57.465 --> 38:59.768
They're using
nature as an excuse

38:59.802 --> 39:01.805
to push their
number one agenda,

39:02.737 --> 39:04.840
doing away with men.

39:04.873 --> 39:07.109
They go on believing
that they don't need us,

39:07.143 --> 39:09.478
but that's just
another example

39:09.512 --> 39:12.115
of their reckless,
short-term way of thinking.

39:12.148 --> 39:14.717
Being women, they can't
think strategically.

39:14.750 --> 39:16.920
They're incapable of
seeing the big picture.

39:18.820 --> 39:21.423
<i>I'll give you an example.</i>

39:21.456 --> 39:25.862
<i>In 1960, the U.S. Defense Department
was all set to fund a program</i>

39:25.894 --> 39:28.431
<i>that would allow the computers
all around the world</i>

39:28.463 --> 39:29.865
to connect with each other.

39:29.898 --> 39:31.567
They'd have been
linked together

39:31.599 --> 39:34.170
in a massive
communication web.

39:34.202 --> 39:37.005
Could you imagine if all
our word processing units

39:37.039 --> 39:38.841
could talk to each other?

39:38.873 --> 39:41.143
Bloody amazing, right?

39:41.177 --> 39:43.947
Well, women take
over and guess what?

39:47.650 --> 39:49.751
<i>The U.S. Defense budget
gets stuffed.</i>

39:53.822 --> 39:56.625
Don't even getting me started
on space exploration.

39:56.659 --> 39:59.929
They gutted NASA
in the early 1960s,

39:59.961 --> 40:03.032
and the Russian program
didn't stand a chance, either.

40:03.065 --> 40:05.501
<i>I really don't understand
this obsession they have</i>

40:05.534 --> 40:07.804
<i>with putting
a man on the moon.</i>

40:07.836 --> 40:10.940
<i>We all appreciate the important
role it plays in our lives,</i>

40:10.972 --> 40:13.175
<i>but do we really need
to go to the trouble</i>

40:13.208 --> 40:15.444
<i>of sending someone
up there to stand on it?</i>

40:16.244 --> 40:18.847
<i>I don't think so.</i>

40:18.880 --> 40:21.984
<i>Now, if we had a way to put
all of the men on the moon...</i>

40:23.251 --> 40:25.454
So what do we have to show

40:25.487 --> 40:29.057
for all these massive spending
cuts and program cancellations?

40:29.090 --> 40:32.694
World peace and electric cars.
Big bloody deal.

40:37.132 --> 40:42.038
<i>True progress only
comes about through conflict.</i>

40:42.070 --> 40:44.973
<i>Used to be a time when
one country fancied another,</i>

40:45.007 --> 40:46.876
<i>they'd invade it.</i>

40:46.909 --> 40:49.077
<i>War was declared,
and they battled it out</i>

40:49.110 --> 40:51.246
until one of
them was defeated.

40:51.280 --> 40:54.817
And a bigger, stronger nation
was born out of it.

40:54.849 --> 40:55.851
<i>Dale?</i>

40:58.019 --> 41:00.088
<i>I was just fixing my hair.</i>

41:00.121 --> 41:03.225
<i>Used to be a time,
if a man fancied a woman,</i>

41:03.259 --> 41:05.795
<i>he'd court her,
turn on the charm.</i>

41:05.827 --> 41:07.563
<i>but I'd rather
look at you.</i>

41:07.596 --> 41:09.532
<i>You're beautiful, Connie.</i>

41:09.565 --> 41:12.568
Until she had no choice
but to fall for him.

41:12.601 --> 41:14.971
And they'd get together,
and they'd have sex.

41:15.003 --> 41:16.105
<i>Intercourse.</i>

41:16.137 --> 41:18.974
That's a form of conflict.

41:19.007 --> 41:22.077
And out of that came children.
True progress.

41:24.146 --> 41:25.848
Now?

41:25.880 --> 41:28.851
We live in a world where
there's no wars, no.

41:40.929 --> 41:43.866
<i>I remember when my parents
told me I was the last boy.</i>

41:45.768 --> 41:49.639
I started wondering if maybe I
was the cause of the problem.

41:51.639 --> 41:54.743
That somehow I had stopped any
more of us from coming out.

41:56.045 --> 41:59.081
Like maybe I had broken
the machinery or something.

41:59.114 --> 42:01.284
Or that God had
taken one look at me

42:01.317 --> 42:03.052
and said, "That's it,
I'm done with males."

42:07.755 --> 42:10.659
<i>Even though we still
don't know for certain,</i>

42:10.693 --> 42:14.063
<i>a consensus has emerged as to what
caused the extinction of the dinosaurs.</i>

42:16.831 --> 42:19.167
<i>The same will
be true with men.</i>

42:19.201 --> 42:21.670
Until the cause
is discovered,

42:21.704 --> 42:25.708
a dominant theory will emerge
and become conventional wisdom.

42:25.740 --> 42:28.978
My personal feeling?
It's evolution.

42:30.179 --> 42:32.081
Humans evolved from the apes

42:32.114 --> 42:35.016
and now we're evolving
further into a single sex.

42:35.050 --> 42:36.152
But why?

42:37.619 --> 42:39.288
Why would nature do that?

42:39.320 --> 42:42.958
We just don't need
them anymore. That's all.

42:42.992 --> 42:45.661
It's not as if we're
a hunter-gatherer society.

42:45.693 --> 42:47.829
We don't need men
to protect us

42:47.862 --> 42:50.298
or hunt for food
or build shelters.

42:50.331 --> 42:52.233
And since they
aren't needed anymore,

42:52.266 --> 42:54.069
nature just
stopped producing them.

42:54.103 --> 42:55.938
It's nothing personal.

42:55.971 --> 42:57.373
<i>It's the penis.</i>

42:57.405 --> 43:03.144
It was responsible for the skyscrapers,
the missiles, the oil drills,

43:03.177 --> 43:06.648
and eventually all of that
aggressive, phallic energy

43:06.681 --> 43:09.050
had such a corroding effect
on the planet

43:09.083 --> 43:11.853
that nature had no choice
but to extinguish it.

43:11.887 --> 43:14.356
<i>You know what a NEO is?</i>

43:14.389 --> 43:16.224
<i>Near Earth object.</i>

43:16.257 --> 43:18.994
<i>Now normally,
they're comets or asteroids.</i>

43:20.695 --> 43:22.898
<i>Well, in 1952,
astronomers recorded one</i>

43:22.931 --> 43:25.967
<i>that they thought
was an asteroid.</i>

43:26.001 --> 43:28.738
<i>But due to an unusually large
cloud of solar debris</i>

43:28.771 --> 43:31.106
<i>that was surrounding it,
there was no way to be sure.</i>

43:33.675 --> 43:39.382
<i>Nine months later, the first
so-called fatherless baby was born.</i>

43:39.414 --> 43:43.952
Women have two X chromosomes,
men only have one,

43:43.985 --> 43:47.155
which would be okay if our Y
chromosome had something to offer.

43:48.389 --> 43:50.826
But the fact is,
it pales in comparison.

43:52.027 --> 43:54.030
It only carries
a tiny complement of genes

43:54.063 --> 43:56.898
and it offers no protection
against genetic mutations.

43:58.199 --> 44:00.168
It's kind of
a runty little thing.

44:02.070 --> 44:05.940
And I suspect that's
ultimately what's doing us in.

44:05.974 --> 44:08.177
<i>Why wouldn't there
be female aliens?</i>

44:08.210 --> 44:11.681
<i>A race of asexual,
female aliens</i>

44:13.014 --> 44:16.351
<i>that come to Earth to hijack
our reproductive system.</i>

44:16.385 --> 44:18.287
<i>And do you want to know
why the government</i>

44:18.320 --> 44:20.222
<i>doesn't have an explanation?</i>

44:20.255 --> 44:22.858
<i>Because if they admitted
they knew what the cause was,</i>

44:22.891 --> 44:26.195
<i>they'd be that much closer
to being able to fix it.</i>

44:26.228 --> 44:28.030
<i>So either they
don't want to know</i>

44:28.063 --> 44:29.999
<i>and they've got their
heads stuck in the sand,</i>

44:30.032 --> 44:33.302
<i>or they do know and they're
hiding the truth from us.</i>

44:33.335 --> 44:36.905
<i>Either way, they're avoiding
dealing with the situation.</i>

44:36.938 --> 44:38.273
<i>Men aren't like that,
are they?</i>

44:38.306 --> 44:39.908
<i>-No.
-No! No.</i>

44:39.942 --> 44:42.311
<i>When we see a problem,
we attack it.</i>

44:42.344 --> 44:45.313
<i>We tear it apart until we know
everything there is to know about it.</i>

44:45.347 --> 44:47.149
<i>And then what do we do?</i>

44:47.181 --> 44:49.016
<i>-We fix it!
-We fix it!</i>

44:49.050 --> 44:53.788
<i>We don't form committees or talking
circles or go on listening tours.</i>

44:53.822 --> 44:55.758
<i>-We fix it.
-Fix it! Fix it!</i>

44:55.791 --> 44:58.327
<i>And that's exactly
what we're gonna do.</i>

44:58.360 --> 45:01.963
<i>We're gonna get back into power
and put an end to manlessness.</i>

45:01.996 --> 45:04.332
<i>Fix it! Fix it! Fix it!</i>

45:04.365 --> 45:06.802
<i>Fix it! Fix it! Fix it!</i>

45:06.835 --> 45:08.471
<i>Fix it! Fix it! Fix it!</i>

45:10.472 --> 45:14.176
<i>I just received some
very important information.</i>

45:14.208 --> 45:16.077
<i>They're serving tenderloin
in the mess hall tonight</i>

45:16.110 --> 45:17.212
<i>and they're
serving it right now.</i>

45:17.246 --> 45:18.981
<i>Come on! Let's go.</i>

45:24.485 --> 45:30.125
<i>I realize now it was a kind of
survivor's guilt that I was feeling.</i>

45:30.159 --> 45:34.130
<i>And even though it's totally
crazy, I still feel twinges of it.</i>

45:34.163 --> 45:38.099
<i>It's usually when I see
other men looking at me,</i>

45:38.132 --> 45:41.870
and I think they blame me for
being the last one out the door.

45:44.505 --> 45:46.775
"What did you do?
What did you do?"

45:48.543 --> 45:50.112
I don't feel good about it.

45:51.146 --> 45:53.048
But I don't feel bad, either.

45:54.849 --> 45:57.118
It's not like
they're being massacred.

45:57.152 --> 46:01.257
They're just
getting old and dying off.

46:01.289 --> 46:04.393
It's like, I remember reading
in the paper a while ago

46:04.425 --> 46:07.563
that the last surviving member
of this rock band had died.

46:07.596 --> 46:10.331
They were called
The Raymonds, I think.

46:10.364 --> 46:12.167
The Ramones?

46:12.201 --> 46:15.070
Right. Anyway,
I remember feeling sad.

46:16.405 --> 46:18.974
But not for all
the members of the band,

46:19.007 --> 46:21.577
or because they wouldn't
be producing any new songs,

46:21.610 --> 46:23.512
but because
someone had died.

46:23.545 --> 46:24.947
That's always sad,

46:26.047 --> 46:28.183
but that's also
a part of life.

46:29.384 --> 46:32.021
Nothing is forever.

46:32.054 --> 46:37.059
You're comparing the extinction of
men to a punk band from the '70s?

46:38.994 --> 46:42.030
It's actually kind
of the same thing.

46:42.063 --> 46:44.299
One day, I'm going
to open up the paper

46:44.333 --> 46:47.903
and find out that
the last man has died.

46:47.936 --> 46:51.807
And I think I'm going to feel the same
way that I did about The Raymonds.

46:55.943 --> 46:57.413
Hi,
I'm so excited to meet you.

46:57.445 --> 46:59.315
-I loved your book.
-So nice to meet you.

46:59.347 --> 47:00.548
Nice to meet you.

47:00.581 --> 47:02.183
What's your name?

47:02.217 --> 47:05.186
<i>Imagine if
the entire planet</i>

47:05.219 --> 47:07.355
<i>was exposed to sunlight
24 hours a day.</i>

47:10.057 --> 47:13.295
<i>It would never get dark, so we wouldn't
have any use for the word "night."</i>

47:14.463 --> 47:16.899
The same is true
for the word "gender."

47:16.931 --> 47:20.602
Once men are gone, it will
cease to have any meaning.

47:20.635 --> 47:24.472
And good riddance. It's the most
divisive word in human history.

47:24.505 --> 47:28.109
But doing away with gender does not
mean we have to do away with sex.

47:39.186 --> 47:42.290
<i>Despite what the government
would have us believe,</i>

47:42.324 --> 47:44.126
<i>women still crave
sexual intimacy,</i>

47:46.295 --> 47:48.297
<i>just as we're still
instinctively pairing off</i>

47:48.329 --> 47:50.331
<i>in order to
raise our children.</i>

47:50.364 --> 47:52.233
<i>Because without intimacy,</i>

47:52.266 --> 47:54.335
the bond that
holds a couple together

47:54.369 --> 47:56.372
will eventually
start to disintegrate.

47:56.405 --> 47:58.540
And then their families
will disintegrate,

47:58.572 --> 48:02.076
and then where does that
leave our society as a whole?

48:04.146 --> 48:06.148
<i>But the government hasn't
embraced this rationale.</i>

48:06.181 --> 48:08.684
<i>In fact, the members
of the Governing Council</i>

48:08.717 --> 48:11.487
<i>are these
out-of-touch conservatives</i>

48:11.519 --> 48:13.956
<i>who harbor an irrational fear
of a male resurgence.</i>

48:14.956 --> 48:17.659
And this paranoia
has trickled down

48:17.693 --> 48:20.262
into the bedrock of the
government's social policy,

48:20.295 --> 48:23.097
which explains
why it's so extreme.

48:23.130 --> 48:25.266
They've turned their
fear of heterosexuality

48:25.300 --> 48:27.370
into a fear of any
kind of sex at all.

48:28.302 --> 48:31.940
<i>Mom, can I ask you something?</i>

48:31.974 --> 48:34.476
<i>Of course, dear.
What is it?</i>

48:34.509 --> 48:38.414
<i>Is it strange that when
I touch myself, you know,</i>

48:38.447 --> 48:42.285
<i>down there,
that it feels really good?</i>

48:45.686 --> 48:48.423
<i>Have you found yourself
in this situation?</i>

48:48.456 --> 48:50.492
<i>Or perhaps it's a conversation
you're dreading?</i>

48:52.260 --> 48:54.997
<i>Well, don't worry,
you're not alone.</i>

48:55.030 --> 48:58.033
<i>The fact is,
as girls reach puberty,</i>

48:58.065 --> 49:01.202
<i>the joy and excitement
of impending fertility</i>

49:01.235 --> 49:05.974
<i>can often be accompanied by the
confusion and perils of sexual arousal.</i>

49:06.007 --> 49:07.576
<i>The Department of Health
has produced this video...</i>

49:07.608 --> 49:09.577
I think what you
have to understand

49:09.610 --> 49:11.512
is that these are
confusing times.

49:11.545 --> 49:15.451
We are still in a period
of evolutionary transition.

49:15.483 --> 49:17.719
Sexual urges
are still present,

49:17.753 --> 49:20.489
yet sex is no longer
necessary.

49:20.521 --> 49:23.592
Nature will eventually
eradicate these impulses,

49:23.625 --> 49:27.362
but until then, until we
have become fully evolved,

49:27.396 --> 49:30.666
the Governing Council needs
to ensure that young women

49:30.699 --> 49:33.269
don't get caught up in the
futility of erotic pleasure.

49:36.170 --> 49:38.606
We're not supposed
to talk about it.

49:38.639 --> 49:41.275
We're actually not supposed
to even know about it.

49:41.309 --> 49:42.979
Especially
the old kind of sex.

49:44.512 --> 49:46.648
You know, intercourse?

49:46.681 --> 49:49.351
And now there's all
this worry about urges.

49:49.384 --> 49:53.389
"Are you having urges?
Don't give in to the urges."

49:53.422 --> 49:55.224
Next they'll be telling us
that if we get an itch,

49:55.257 --> 49:56.791
we shouldn't scratch it.

49:56.824 --> 49:59.727
It's not physical,
it's psychological.

49:59.760 --> 50:02.563
So you just need to
not think about it.

50:02.597 --> 50:06.635
I mean, if you were to have
those feelings... Thoughts.

50:06.668 --> 50:08.537
They're thoughts,
not feelings.

50:10.639 --> 50:13.041
Which I've never had.

50:13.074 --> 50:16.244
We are not trying to
discourage intimacy.

50:16.277 --> 50:19.414
At least not
emotional intimacy.

50:19.447 --> 50:22.617
It is critical that
young people be taught

50:22.650 --> 50:27.522
to nurture meaningful and deeply
fulfilling non-sexual bonds,

50:27.556 --> 50:30.425
because they need to
grow up believing in love.

50:32.260 --> 50:34.797
We all need to
believe in that.

50:34.829 --> 50:38.299
<i>You're a funny little thing,
aren't you?</i>

50:38.333 --> 50:39.802
<i>Would you like me to
tell you another story?</i>

50:41.536 --> 50:42.871
<i>All right.</i>

50:42.903 --> 50:45.541
<i>Well, once upon a time,
there was a fair maiden...</i>

50:45.574 --> 50:46.708
<i>Hello.</i>

50:46.740 --> 50:48.610
<i>Your Highness.</i>

50:48.643 --> 50:49.861
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

50:49.862 --> 50:51.079
<i>It's all right.</i>

50:51.112 --> 50:54.348
<i>-I certainly didn't mean to startle...
-I just wasn't expecting...</i>

50:54.382 --> 50:55.418
<i>-You.
-You.</i>

50:57.719 --> 51:02.090
Jasmine and I, my best friend,
we've talked about it.

51:02.123 --> 51:06.794
And we both like a lot of the same
music and we get along really well.

51:06.827 --> 51:10.465
But I'm just not sure I want to
spend the rest of my life with her.

51:14.735 --> 51:16.704
<i>We've known
each other forever.</i>

51:16.737 --> 51:18.172
<i>Not quite.</i>

51:18.206 --> 51:19.173
<i>Well,
since high school.</i>

51:19.206 --> 51:21.210
<i>Grade 11.</i>

51:21.242 --> 51:23.311
<i>That's when I had Dahlia.</i>

51:23.344 --> 51:27.348
I had partnered up with a friend
of mine, but that didn't work out.

51:27.382 --> 51:31.854
Then Iris got called, and we
were both looking to pair off,

51:31.887 --> 51:34.756
so it was
just great timing.

51:34.789 --> 51:37.226
And we've been
together ever since.

51:38.626 --> 51:41.163
I think it's proof that
you can partner with someone

51:41.195 --> 51:44.866
without there having
to be that intimacy.

51:44.900 --> 51:47.769
Because you can't force
someone to feel that way.

51:47.802 --> 51:52.574
Terra and I are good friends,
we're partners,

51:52.606 --> 51:55.143
we're raising
our kids together,

51:55.177 --> 51:57.746
but it's not
anything more than that.

51:57.778 --> 52:00.882
I think it's worked out
really well for us.

52:00.916 --> 52:02.351
Right?

52:03.818 --> 52:06.255
Yes, yeah, of course.
It's been great.

52:07.789 --> 52:12.561
But you know, I also think
it's easy to understand,

52:12.594 --> 52:16.498
given the circumstances, why
someone else might want a...

52:16.530 --> 52:19.400
I don't know, a deeper bond
with their partner.

52:20.936 --> 52:23.572
I'm not saying it should be
sexual or anything like that.

52:23.605 --> 52:25.641
Of course not,
it shouldn't be.

52:25.673 --> 52:30.411
But that doesn't mean it can't be
something more meaningful or intense.

52:32.280 --> 52:35.384
But there are men
still out there.

52:35.416 --> 52:38.186
Some of them aren't
that much older than you or I.

52:38.954 --> 52:41.190
So it's not
completely hopeless.

52:43.657 --> 52:45.893
It just bothers me the way
that people talk about men

52:45.927 --> 52:47.229
like they're already gone.

52:47.262 --> 52:48.797
They're not.

52:48.829 --> 52:50.431
They're still here.

52:51.298 --> 52:53.168
One of them is, anyway.

52:56.003 --> 52:58.173
She's talking
about Andrew.

52:59.507 --> 53:01.376
Okay, yeah.

53:02.344 --> 53:04.313
Andrew is a good example.

53:05.746 --> 53:07.782
And I'll admit it,
I'm very fond of him.

53:14.889 --> 53:19.228
Can we... Could we just
take a small break?

53:19.260 --> 53:21.663
I just need to...
Excuse me.

53:37.846 --> 53:39.548
<i>It's not like
I didn't know there was</i>

53:39.581 --> 53:40.749
<i>something going
on between them.</i>

53:43.451 --> 53:46.621
<i>The way they look at each
other, and Iris' paintings.</i>

53:48.023 --> 53:51.827
But I assumed... I hoped

53:54.295 --> 53:56.264
it was a harmless flirtation.

53:57.766 --> 53:58.834
But it's not.

54:00.768 --> 54:03.438
I can see that now, it's
obvious, they're intimate.

54:10.644 --> 54:13.315
<i>It's not like we were
planning for it to happen.</i>

54:15.684 --> 54:19.054
The more time he and I
spent together, we just...

54:19.086 --> 54:20.521
It happened.

54:24.626 --> 54:27.763
Everything's gonna change now
with Terra and I,

54:30.798 --> 54:32.534
and Andrew.

54:42.409 --> 54:45.280
<i>She likes having
this aura of mystery.</i>

54:48.615 --> 54:52.288
It's part of being an artist,
right? Being provocative.

54:54.989 --> 54:57.559
But I never believed
she was actually crooked.

54:59.094 --> 55:00.862
I just thought
it was an act.

55:03.764 --> 55:06.534
<i>Surprise, surprise, right?</i>

55:06.568 --> 55:08.503
<i>You only see what
you want to see.</i>

55:08.536 --> 55:10.038
-I have no idea what to do.
-It's going to be fine.

55:10.070 --> 55:11.339
No, I don't think it is.

55:11.373 --> 55:12.608
-You sure?
-Yes.

55:18.480 --> 55:19.782
What are they doing?

55:38.465 --> 55:39.801
What's going on?

55:41.769 --> 55:46.407
Okay, okay, back in the house.
Now. Everyone, come on, go, go.

55:52.880 --> 55:54.817
Can you turn
it off, please?

55:55.949 --> 55:57.385
Excuse me?

55:58.987 --> 56:00.489
Now, please.

56:03.056 --> 56:05.426
Of course there are still women
who are attracted to men

56:05.460 --> 56:06.927
and don't want them
to perish.

56:06.960 --> 56:08.363
We understand that.

56:09.597 --> 56:12.967
<i>But they are a small segment
of the population,</i>

56:13.001 --> 56:14.769
<i>maybe 10%.</i>

56:16.838 --> 56:19.807
<i>And like the men they're pining
for, they're a dying breed.</i>

56:22.976 --> 56:26.815
Which is why we think it's best
for the population as a whole,

56:26.847 --> 56:28.949
and for young people
especially,

56:28.983 --> 56:31.553
to prohibit
opposite sex unions

56:31.585 --> 56:36.023
and to encourage all the remaining
men to go into the sanctuaries,

56:36.056 --> 56:39.126
so we can focus on the next
stage of our evolution

56:39.159 --> 56:42.397
without any unnecessary
distractions or confusion.

56:49.070 --> 56:50.806
So, this is it right here.

56:53.675 --> 56:57.846
People are always expecting a big
electrified fence or something,

56:57.878 --> 57:01.182
but you have to keep in mind
that this particular sanctuary

57:01.215 --> 57:05.586
is over 300 square kilometers, and
it's one of the smaller ones.

57:05.619 --> 57:07.922
So a fence just
isn't an option.

57:09.224 --> 57:11.893
Of course, the service
roads are all gated.

57:11.925 --> 57:14.528
We patrol
the entire perimeter.

57:14.561 --> 57:15.697
But to be honest,

57:15.730 --> 57:18.666
we don't really get many men
trying to escape anymore.

57:18.699 --> 57:21.569
That was more of
an issue 10, 20 years ago.

57:22.836 --> 57:24.405
<i>Hurry!</i>

57:24.438 --> 57:26.875
<i>Back then, they were
wandering out all the time.</i>

57:26.907 --> 57:28.076
<i>Are you getting him?</i>

57:28.108 --> 57:29.443
<i>Yeah.</i>

57:29.476 --> 57:31.946
<i>Mostly looking
for female contact.</i>

57:31.980 --> 57:34.849
<i>Mom!
There's a man outside!</i>

57:36.717 --> 57:38.819
<i>Just get out of here!</i>

57:38.853 --> 57:40.489
<i>-Hey, no. It's okay.
-Shoo!</i>

57:40.521 --> 57:42.090
<i>It's okay.</i>

57:42.123 --> 57:43.557
<i>Get inside
the house right now.</i>

57:43.590 --> 57:44.960
<i>It's okay.</i>

57:44.992 --> 57:46.927
<i>Don't come any closer.</i>

57:46.960 --> 57:49.597
<i>It's okay.
I just want to talk.</i>

57:50.764 --> 57:53.567
<i>What's your name? I'm Kirk.</i>

57:53.601 --> 57:55.471
<i>I already called
the police.</i>

57:56.271 --> 57:58.573
<i>You're very pretty.</i>

57:58.606 --> 58:00.976
<i>Get inside now!</i>

58:01.009 --> 58:03.110
They just couldn't help
themselves, of course.

58:03.143 --> 58:05.713
It's just part
of their nature.

58:05.746 --> 58:08.649
<i>Border patrol agents
quickly arrived at the scene</i>

58:08.682 --> 58:11.887
<i>and then surrounded the man
when he climbed up into a tree.</i>

58:11.920 --> 58:14.490
<i>I wasn't doing anything!
Just leave me alone.</i>

58:15.623 --> 58:17.157
<i>Not you, you're cute.</i>

58:17.190 --> 58:19.059
<i>After a lengthy standoff,</i>

58:19.092 --> 58:21.596
<i>the agents were forced
to use a tranquilizer gun</i>

58:21.628 --> 58:23.598
<i>to sedate the unruly man.</i>

58:25.032 --> 58:28.869
<i>They then returned him to the
nearby Northbrook Sanctuary,</i>

58:28.902 --> 58:31.739
<i>where he is no doubt
rethinking any future plans</i>

58:31.773 --> 58:33.642
<i>to venture
outside the perimeter.</i>

58:33.675 --> 58:35.010
<i>Like animals.</i>

58:35.043 --> 58:37.144
That's how I'd
characterize it.

58:37.177 --> 58:40.781
Except when animals are endangered,
everybody's all up in arms.

58:40.815 --> 58:43.284
Committees are formed,
monies are raised.

58:43.318 --> 58:46.955
Can't do without those
Tasmanian fruit bats, can we?

58:46.987 --> 58:49.156
But what do they do
when it comes to men?

58:49.190 --> 58:51.159
They take away
our livelihoods,

58:51.192 --> 58:52.960
shove us out
into the wilderness,

58:52.994 --> 58:55.630
erase us from
their books and movies.

58:55.663 --> 58:58.800
And just for good measure, they
basically go and castrate us.

59:00.601 --> 59:02.636
I'm not joking.

59:02.670 --> 59:05.840
<i>This is evidence,</i>

59:05.873 --> 59:09.144
<i>undeniable proof that what we've
been suspecting for years</i>

59:09.177 --> 59:10.679
<i>is actually going on.</i>

59:12.480 --> 59:16.751
<i>The report clearly states that they
are lacing our food with estrogen,</i>

59:17.784 --> 59:19.253
<i>which is the girly hormone.</i>

59:19.286 --> 59:20.955
<i>Smith claimed the document,</i>

59:20.989 --> 59:23.858
<i>which he says is
an internal government memo,</i>

59:23.891 --> 59:26.894
<i>clearly shows that the Governing
Council has been carrying out</i>

59:26.927 --> 59:29.998
<i>a program intended to,
quote, "kill their boners."</i>

59:30.030 --> 59:33.168
<i>A man's sex drive
is his life blood.</i>

59:33.201 --> 59:37.038
<i>You take that away from him,
you might as well kill him.</i>

59:37.070 --> 59:40.842
<i>So I am here to tell you that
we will no longer eat the food.</i>

59:40.875 --> 59:44.646
<i>We are now officially
on a hunger strike.</i>

59:44.679 --> 59:47.081
<i>They might be able to
strip us of our dignity,</i>

59:47.114 --> 59:50.751
<i>but they will never
take away our manhood.</i>

59:50.784 --> 59:53.687
The problem was,
other than that memo,

59:53.721 --> 59:56.224
which the government claimed
was just a discussion paper,

59:56.257 --> 59:58.927
there was no proof.

59:58.960 --> 01:00:02.831
<i>They had found a way to put a
synthetic hormone into the food</i>

01:00:02.864 --> 01:00:05.032
<i>without there being
any way to detect it.</i>

01:00:05.065 --> 01:00:07.167
<i>Which just shows,
once again,</i>

01:00:07.201 --> 01:00:09.371
how capable their
scientists can be

01:00:09.403 --> 01:00:11.306
when they put their
minds to something.

01:00:11.338 --> 01:00:12.440
<i>Thanks, Dawn.</i>

01:00:12.474 --> 01:00:13.875
<i>Speaking of things
that are short-lived,</i>

01:00:13.907 --> 01:00:17.144
<i>the Male Liberation
Organization announced today</i>

01:00:17.177 --> 01:00:20.248
<i>they are ending their hunger strike
after only a day and a half.</i>

01:00:20.280 --> 01:00:23.351
<i>Darius Smith, the group's
leader, would only say</i>

01:00:23.384 --> 01:00:25.853
<i>it was due to "circumstances
beyond their control."</i>

01:00:25.887 --> 01:00:27.722
What were we
supposed to do?

01:00:27.755 --> 01:00:30.925
When a man gets hungry,
he has to eat.

01:00:30.958 --> 01:00:33.327
That's just
the way it is.

01:00:33.360 --> 01:00:35.262
Does that mean we failed?

01:00:35.295 --> 01:00:37.031
No, not in the least.

01:00:37.065 --> 01:00:39.400
Now the world is
aware of the lengths

01:00:39.434 --> 01:00:43.405
that this authoritarian regime
will go to denigrate men.

01:00:43.438 --> 01:00:45.407
But you're still
eating the food.

01:00:45.440 --> 01:00:47.409
Couldn't you have grown
and prepared your own food?

01:00:47.442 --> 01:00:51.278
Yes, of course we could have
grown and prepared our own food.

01:00:51.311 --> 01:00:54.848
But we've deliberately chosen
not to, out of protest.

01:00:54.882 --> 01:00:56.918
Because if we'd refused
the tainted food,

01:00:56.951 --> 01:00:59.153
the story would
have gone away.

01:00:59.186 --> 01:01:02.923
People will forget what
their government did to us.

01:01:02.956 --> 01:01:06.027
But by continuing
to eat it every day,

01:01:06.059 --> 01:01:08.797
the world is
constantly reminded.

01:01:08.829 --> 01:01:11.165
They have to live with it
just like we do.

01:01:12.467 --> 01:01:16.304
I'm not at liberty to go
into many details about that,

01:01:16.336 --> 01:01:20.175
but I can say that we did add
estrogen to the sanctuary food.

01:01:20.208 --> 01:01:22.476
But only until 2008.

01:01:22.510 --> 01:01:25.213
At that time,
we realized the initiative

01:01:25.246 --> 01:01:27.749
was no longer necessary due to
the increasing age of the men.

01:01:29.217 --> 01:01:31.253
They were losing their
sex drives naturally.

01:01:33.487 --> 01:01:36.223
That's a load of crap.

01:01:36.257 --> 01:01:39.193
Of course they're
still lacing the food.

01:01:39.226 --> 01:01:41.829
It's bloody propaganda
is what that is.

01:01:46.166 --> 01:01:48.170
We're not so old either,
you know?

01:02:14.896 --> 01:02:18.233
No harm in showing
this now, I guess.

01:02:18.266 --> 01:02:21.202
<i>People assume that because
I was the last one born,</i>

01:02:21.235 --> 01:02:23.771
<i>that I'm very involved
in the cause.</i>

01:02:26.106 --> 01:02:29.210
<i>I get approached all the time
by pro-male organizations,</i>

01:02:29.242 --> 01:02:32.813
the MLO, Man Up, Penis.

01:02:32.847 --> 01:02:35.316
They all want me
to use my notoriety

01:02:35.349 --> 01:02:38.820
to help raise awareness,
to lobby the government.

01:02:41.121 --> 01:02:42.223
But that's not who I am.

01:02:45.893 --> 01:02:47.228
<i>I'm not the activist type.</i>

01:02:55.268 --> 01:02:58.906
<i>Believe me, there are others who are
way more effective at that than me.</i>

01:03:00.974 --> 01:03:02.309
<i>You know, leaders.</i>

01:03:07.181 --> 01:03:08.383
<i>I'm just a guy.</i>

01:03:15.188 --> 01:03:16.990
<i>I don't know.</i>

01:03:17.023 --> 01:03:18.926
<i>It's hard to see how
we can be together now.</i>

01:03:21.228 --> 01:03:23.063
<i>The government
would never sanction it.</i>

01:03:25.532 --> 01:03:27.235
Being intimate
with your employer

01:03:27.268 --> 01:03:28.336
doesn't look good
on your record.

01:03:31.405 --> 01:03:34.943
I guess I just got
to stay positive.

01:04:03.371 --> 01:04:05.907
<i>I'm not gonna say
it's a terrible place.</i>

01:04:05.940 --> 01:04:08.943
Excuse me, are these lima
beans in the quinoa salad?

01:04:08.976 --> 01:04:10.412
-No, they're split peas.
-Yeah?

01:04:12.079 --> 01:04:12.981
<i>It's not.</i>

01:04:15.181 --> 01:04:16.350
<i>They treat us well.</i>

01:04:21.621 --> 01:04:24.125
<i>But it doesn't matter
how comfortable a place is,</i>

01:04:25.393 --> 01:04:27.128
<i>it can still
feel like a prison.</i>

01:04:35.001 --> 01:04:37.905
<i>They say the trick is to fill
your days up as much as you can.</i>

01:04:39.606 --> 01:04:41.309
<i>To try to enjoy yourself.</i>

01:04:44.945 --> 01:04:46.914
<i>But I can't seem to do that.</i>

01:04:49.282 --> 01:04:52.353
<i>My mind is
always somewhere else.</i>

01:04:54.554 --> 01:04:56.957
<i>Back at the house with Iris.</i>

01:04:59.693 --> 01:05:02.429
That's not what it's like
for most of these guys.

01:05:02.463 --> 01:05:04.632
They've gotten
used to it here.

01:05:04.664 --> 01:05:05.933
They like it.

01:05:07.235 --> 01:05:10.238
But then again, most of them have
no reason to want to go back.

01:05:12.572 --> 01:05:13.474
I do.

01:05:24.085 --> 01:05:25.353
<i>That's gorgeous.</i>

01:05:26.554 --> 01:05:28.722
<i>Hold that... That will
look wonderful on you.</i>

01:05:28.755 --> 01:05:32.259
<i>Here we have the guest of
honor, the so lovely Olive,</i>

01:05:32.293 --> 01:05:34.729
<i>who, as you can see,
is celebrating her first moon.</i>

01:05:34.762 --> 01:05:36.298
Yay!

01:05:40.367 --> 01:05:43.103
<i>I guess on the surface,
things went back to normal.</i>

01:05:43.137 --> 01:05:45.206
<i>How does it
feel to be a woman?</i>

01:05:45.239 --> 01:05:47.976
<i>Tingly?</i>

01:05:48.009 --> 01:05:50.144
<i>But it wasn't
the same after Andrew left.</i>

01:05:50.177 --> 01:05:53.381
<i>And here we have
the proud mother.</i>

01:05:53.414 --> 01:05:56.718
Terra and I, we just couldn't
recover from what happened.

01:05:56.751 --> 01:05:58.519
She felt betrayed.

01:05:58.552 --> 01:06:00.355
<i>Let's get a picture
of the two moms.</i>

01:06:00.387 --> 01:06:02.356
<i>And nothing I
could say was gonna</i>

01:06:02.389 --> 01:06:04.257
<i>make her see
things differently.</i>

01:06:04.291 --> 01:06:06.160
<i>Harold,
can you move?</i>

01:06:06.193 --> 01:06:07.729
<i>Harold.</i>

01:06:07.762 --> 01:06:09.464
<i>-What's that?
-Can you move, please?</i>

01:06:11.699 --> 01:06:14.001
<i>And the kids
really missed Andrew.</i>

01:06:15.668 --> 01:06:17.105
Especially Dahlia.

01:06:19.539 --> 01:06:22.443
For my part, I tried to
move on with my life,

01:06:23.510 --> 01:06:26.213
but I couldn't.

01:06:26.246 --> 01:06:27.581
I couldn't stop
thinking about him.

01:06:45.432 --> 01:06:47.635
<i>What really got to me
was when I stopped</i>

01:06:47.668 --> 01:06:52.140
<i>and thought about how I was going to
be there for the rest of my life.</i>

01:06:54.474 --> 01:06:56.677
It was like being
on the deck of a ship

01:06:56.710 --> 01:06:59.514
that was sinking
really slowly.

01:06:59.547 --> 01:07:01.749
And the women have
all left on the lifeboats,

01:07:01.782 --> 01:07:03.485
but the men are
just sitting there.

01:07:07.253 --> 01:07:08.389
<i>Waiting to meet their fate.</i>

01:07:12.525 --> 01:07:14.094
<i>That's kind of
when it hit home.</i>

01:07:16.163 --> 01:07:19.300
<i>How when I'm gone,
we're all gonna be gone.</i>

01:07:21.835 --> 01:07:24.138
I knew I couldn't
just sit there waiting.

01:07:26.574 --> 01:07:28.510
<i>I had to do something.</i>

01:07:31.711 --> 01:07:33.213
<i>I had to leave.</i>

01:07:40.387 --> 01:07:43.291
<i>They don't make it
easy to do that, though.</i>

01:07:43.324 --> 01:07:46.327
<i>I left in the middle of the night
and I ran as fast as I could.</i>

01:07:47.894 --> 01:07:50.163
<i>But it didn't take long
before they found me.</i>

01:08:07.581 --> 01:08:09.550
He didn't think
I was gonna be there.

01:08:09.583 --> 01:08:12.186
I was praying that she
was going to be there,

01:08:12.219 --> 01:08:14.121
but I had no idea
if she got my message.

01:08:15.822 --> 01:08:18.225
He was just staring at me with
this stunned look on his face.

01:08:18.893 --> 01:08:20.528
<i>So I said...</i>

01:08:20.560 --> 01:08:22.462
You just gonna stand there? Or
are we gonna get out of here?

01:08:38.912 --> 01:08:41.348
<i>I think that we were so
determined to be together</i>

01:08:41.381 --> 01:08:44.350
<i>that we never really stopped and
thought about all the implications.</i>

01:08:46.252 --> 01:08:48.488
<i>They were gonna
be looking for Andrew,</i>

01:08:48.520 --> 01:08:50.725
<i>and we couldn't
go into hiding.</i>

01:08:50.756 --> 01:08:51.858
<i>What kind of life is that?</i>

01:08:53.527 --> 01:08:55.462
<i>I mean,
we'd already been hiding.</i>

01:08:55.496 --> 01:08:57.131
<i>Pretending like
we weren't involved.</i>

01:08:58.666 --> 01:09:00.399
<i>This was gonna
be a lot harder.</i>

01:09:02.536 --> 01:09:05.706
It just seemed so unfair,
because what we wanted

01:09:05.738 --> 01:09:07.506
felt so natural.

01:09:07.541 --> 01:09:10.145
To be together,
to marry, to have kids.

01:09:11.212 --> 01:09:12.680
And none of it
was possible.

01:09:13.948 --> 01:09:15.682
But if we wanted
things to change,

01:09:17.952 --> 01:09:20.453
we were gonna have to be the
ones to do something about it.

01:09:30.363 --> 01:09:33.567
<i>There's been a surprising development
in the sanctuary escape story</i>

01:09:33.600 --> 01:09:35.335
<i>that we told you
about last week.</i>

01:09:35.368 --> 01:09:37.270
<i>The 37-year-old Myers</i>

01:09:37.304 --> 01:09:39.006
<i>surprised everyone
today when he arrived</i>

01:09:39.037 --> 01:09:41.809
<i>at the Jefferson Street Community
Hall to give a press conference.</i>

01:09:41.841 --> 01:09:43.944
<i>Andrew Myers,
the youngest man in the world,</i>

01:09:43.978 --> 01:09:48.615
<i>resurfaced today after escaping
from the Alice Lake Sanctuary.</i>

01:09:48.649 --> 01:09:50.917
<i>At an impromptu
press conference,</i>

01:09:50.951 --> 01:09:53.319
<i>he and his former employer,
Iris Balishev,</i>

01:09:53.354 --> 01:09:55.256
<i>made a startling announcement.</i>

01:09:55.288 --> 01:09:56.890
<i>We not only want
the right to marry,</i>

01:09:56.923 --> 01:09:58.725
<i>we want to have
children together.</i>

01:10:01.595 --> 01:10:03.331
<i>Even though
heterosexual reproduction</i>

01:10:03.363 --> 01:10:05.465
<i>is considered
to be impossible,</i>

01:10:05.498 --> 01:10:08.301
<i>it is our hope
and our belief</i>

01:10:08.335 --> 01:10:11.505
<i>that with the resources
of the Governing Council</i>

01:10:11.537 --> 01:10:15.976
<i>and the support of the scientific
community, that it can become a reality.</i>

01:10:16.010 --> 01:10:19.579
<i>That it should
become a reality.</i>

01:10:19.613 --> 01:10:23.317
<i>And I realize that I'm biased
because I'm in love with a man,</i>

01:10:23.350 --> 01:10:24.919
<i>but I know
I'm not the only one.</i>

01:10:24.952 --> 01:10:27.689
<i>Please speak up,
because time is running out.</i>

01:10:29.890 --> 01:10:32.994
<i>Seeing the two of them
together like that,</i>

01:10:33.027 --> 01:10:35.997
<i>so obviously in love,
pleading for recognition,</i>

01:10:36.029 --> 01:10:37.599
it awoke something in people.

01:10:42.536 --> 01:10:43.904
<i>Go ahead,
you're on the air.</i>

01:10:43.938 --> 01:10:47.842
<i>I don't care
who knows anymore. I like men.</i>

01:10:47.875 --> 01:10:49.542
<i>I'm not saying
I totally agree with it,</i>

01:10:49.576 --> 01:10:52.880
<i>but you have to admit,
they make a cute couple.</i>

01:10:52.912 --> 01:10:53.880
<i>I'll tell you what
the answer is. No.</i>

01:10:53.913 --> 01:10:55.682
<i>Just let them die off.</i>

01:10:55.716 --> 01:10:58.552
<i>Come on, are they really
that bad? I don't think so.</i>

01:10:58.585 --> 01:11:00.420
<i>This is
a question of morality.</i>

01:11:00.453 --> 01:11:03.923
<i>We can't just stand by and let them
vanish off the face of the Earth.</i>

01:11:03.957 --> 01:11:06.360
<i>That's not what
women are about.</i>

01:11:06.393 --> 01:11:08.929
<i>There were more calls today
for the Governing Council</i>

01:11:08.962 --> 01:11:10.564
<i>to take action on manlessness.</i>

01:11:10.596 --> 01:11:13.768
<i>Of course, the Governing Council
is aware of the public's reaction.</i>

01:11:13.801 --> 01:11:16.437
<i>And they're taking
it very seriously.</i>

01:11:16.470 --> 01:11:19.006
<i>That's why they've convened
these emergency meetings,</i>

01:11:19.038 --> 01:11:23.043
<i>to assess the situation and
consider any possible solutions.</i>

01:11:23.077 --> 01:11:26.414
It doesn't matter if we figure
out how to keep men around.

01:11:26.447 --> 01:11:29.984
It's not our place to intervene.
This is an act of nature.

01:11:30.016 --> 01:11:31.851
Praise nature.

01:11:31.886 --> 01:11:34.588
<i>I think they should find a way
to start producing men again.</i>

01:11:34.621 --> 01:11:38.391
<i>But not too many.
Maybe 100 or 150.</i>

01:11:38.425 --> 01:11:39.560
<i>Then see how it goes.</i>

01:11:56.643 --> 01:11:59.113
<i>There's been so much attention
focused on us from the press</i>

01:11:59.145 --> 01:12:02.783
<i>that we decided to make it a
really small, private ceremony.</i>

01:12:03.850 --> 01:12:05.353
<i>But it was beautiful.</i>

01:12:05.853 --> 01:12:06.654
<i>And legal.</i>

01:12:06.686 --> 01:12:10.524
We even have
a license to prove it.

01:12:10.556 --> 01:12:12.726
I don't have it on me right
now, but it's the real thing.

01:12:13.493 --> 01:12:15.996
We're married.

01:12:16.029 --> 01:12:17.898
And now we've been getting
even more attention

01:12:17.930 --> 01:12:19.599
because of this
little development.

01:12:21.534 --> 01:12:24.372
It's not so little anymore.

01:12:24.404 --> 01:12:27.742
We don't know if it's a boy.
We asked them not to tell us.

01:12:27.774 --> 01:12:29.543
I really want it
to be a surprise.

01:12:30.743 --> 01:12:33.714
But the procedure worked.
Andrew's DNA is present.

01:12:34.747 --> 01:12:35.615
It's his.

01:12:36.917 --> 01:12:37.752
It's ours.

01:12:41.988 --> 01:12:43.423
It's what she wanted.

01:12:44.591 --> 01:12:46.394
To be with him
and have a baby.

01:12:47.127 --> 01:12:48.563
So good for her.

01:12:51.465 --> 01:12:53.634
<i>And if it's a boy like
everyone seems to think,</i>

01:12:53.667 --> 01:12:54.836
<i>then that's great for the
world, too, I suppose.</i>

01:12:58.905 --> 01:13:00.640
Personally, I couldn't imagine
having something like that

01:13:00.673 --> 01:13:01.775
growing inside of me.

01:13:03.609 --> 01:13:04.845
A male baby.

01:13:09.649 --> 01:13:12.619
<i>It turns out that the Y chromosome
was the culprit after all.</i>

01:13:14.688 --> 01:13:16.791
The government scientists
disguised the Y chromosome

01:13:17.791 --> 01:13:20.194
to look like an X chromosome,

01:13:20.226 --> 01:13:22.796
thereby tricking the egg
into accepting it.

01:13:37.911 --> 01:13:40.514
Do I wish people had been this
excited when I got pregnant?

01:13:40.546 --> 01:13:41.681
Of course.

01:13:43.050 --> 01:13:45.985
But it's a good thing
that's happened.

01:13:46.019 --> 01:13:48.689
I never really liked the idea
of men going extinct.

01:13:49.856 --> 01:13:51.524
Didn't feel right.

01:13:51.557 --> 01:13:54.761
On the other hand,
I'm not going to deny

01:13:54.795 --> 01:13:57.765
that I'm happy they came
as close as they did.

01:13:57.797 --> 01:14:00.667
Gave them one hell of a scare.

01:14:00.701 --> 01:14:02.636
And that's exactly
what they needed.

01:14:06.105 --> 01:14:06.940
Patience.

01:14:08.609 --> 01:14:10.478
That's what I've
been saying all along.

01:14:11.878 --> 01:14:15.483
We just had to stay vigilant,
keep our wits about us.

01:14:17.050 --> 01:14:19.787
And sooner or later,
we'd get our chance.

01:14:21.020 --> 01:14:22.489
And here we are.

01:14:25.125 --> 01:14:26.694
It does feel different.

01:14:27.961 --> 01:14:30.231
I don't know if
it's just in my head,

01:14:30.264 --> 01:14:31.798
but I feel like I'm pregnant
for the first time.

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:34.935
Which, I guess
in a way, I am.

01:14:36.703 --> 01:14:38.606
I don't know,
I'm just really excited.

01:14:40.774 --> 01:14:42.610
I'm just praying
it's not a girl.

01:14:46.846 --> 01:14:48.748
No, no, I was just...
