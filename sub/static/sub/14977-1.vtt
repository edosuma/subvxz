to build whatever prototype
he pulled out of his ass.

of components and wires
into some kind of casing.

to Tanner,

that another company had
the same idea.

about a secret project,

that he's got a spy

let those suckers
take me.

57:17.802 --> 57:19.601
Boom!

57:19.670 --> 57:22.438
Guys, guys, stop rowing.

57:22.506 --> 57:24.740
We would have
passed them by now.

57:24.809 --> 57:26.442
Let's get off the river.

57:26.510 --> 57:28.110
I'm with you, Pullman.

57:28.179 --> 57:30.946
Oh, so you're
in charge now, huh?

57:31.015 --> 57:32.147
Someone has to be.

57:39.256 --> 57:41.423
Hey, we could paddle
a little bit faster,

57:41.492 --> 57:43.292
don't you think?

57:43.360 --> 57:45.227
Why aren't we turning?

57:45.296 --> 57:47.996
Hang on.
Something's not right.

57:48.065 --> 57:50.332
We're not changing
direction at all.

57:57.141 --> 57:58.340
Oh, my God.

57:58.409 --> 57:59.741
What?

58:01.579 --> 58:03.679
They're pulling us.

58:05.149 --> 58:06.982
STELLA:
To where?

58:07.051 --> 58:09.418
They're keeping us
on the river.

58:15.359 --> 58:17.359
[ wincing ]

58:20.264 --> 58:23.265
Oh, poor baby.

58:23.334 --> 58:26.368
Seriously? I could
have saved you, too.

58:26.437 --> 58:28.504
[ scoffs ]
Woulda, coulda, shoulda.

58:29.940 --> 58:32.307
Are you sure
we're going
the right way?

58:32.376 --> 58:33.976
We're going the right way.

58:34.044 --> 58:36.378
What? Are you some kind
of wildlife guide?

58:36.447 --> 58:38.514
This is the way
they told us to go.

58:38.582 --> 58:39.715
When Tanner
announced the trip,

58:39.783 --> 58:42.017
I looked up a map
of the river online.

58:42.086 --> 58:43.619
I studied the whole thing.

58:43.687 --> 58:45.187
Why?

58:45.256 --> 58:47.055
I like maps.

58:47.124 --> 58:48.490
What's there
to like?

58:48.559 --> 58:50.826
They let you know
there's a world out there

58:50.895 --> 58:51.994
beyond what you can see.

58:52.062 --> 58:53.529
We're going
in the right way...

58:53.597 --> 58:55.030
And here comes
the "but."

58:55.099 --> 58:57.132
But there's a chance
we might be

58:57.201 --> 58:59.167
on the wrong side
of the river.

58:59.236 --> 59:00.969
I got all
discombobulated
when we were,

59:01.038 --> 59:02.671
you know,
being murdered
by sharks.

59:02.740 --> 59:04.373
We're going
in the right direction,

59:04.441 --> 59:05.374
but that
ranger station

59:05.442 --> 59:07.242
might be
on the other side.

59:07.311 --> 59:10.212
No way! Ranger lady
and Sergeant Nutjob
back there

59:10.281 --> 59:12.881
would have
told us if it was
on the other side.

59:12.950 --> 59:14.850
Well, they were kind of busy
saving people's lives.

59:14.919 --> 59:17.819
It's not impossible
to think that they
forgot to tell us.

59:19.223 --> 59:20.889
STELLA:
We're surrounded.

59:20.958 --> 59:22.558
What do we do now?

59:23.994 --> 59:25.327
I got it.

59:25.396 --> 59:27.162
I know how we're
gonna get through this.

59:28.365 --> 59:30.332
You do?

59:30.401 --> 59:31.900
Yeah. Come Monday morning,
we're gonna dedicate

59:31.969 --> 59:33.735
a memorial to the people
that we lost today,

59:33.804 --> 59:35.737
so I hope you can remember
all of their names.

59:35.806 --> 59:37.873
There's S...ara?

59:37.942 --> 59:38.874
Stella.

59:38.943 --> 59:40.442
Stella! Stella.
Oh, right.

59:40.511 --> 59:42.210
We need to work
on a press release.

59:42.279 --> 59:44.012
We at the company
are deeply saddened

59:44.081 --> 59:45.280
by the loss
of our employees,

59:45.349 --> 59:46.949
especially given
the circumstances

59:47.017 --> 59:48.951
that we were out here
on this retreat.
Blah-blah-blah.

59:49.019 --> 59:50.185
What the hell
are you doing?

59:50.254 --> 59:51.720
Damage control, honey.

59:51.789 --> 59:53.722
We need to get
off this river.

59:53.791 --> 59:56.291
It's called multitasking,
and I think that we
can get out of trouble

59:56.360 --> 59:57.526
if we spin this
just right.

59:57.595 --> 59:59.094
You know,
you are unbelievable!

59:59.163 --> 1:00:01.296
You don't give a damn
about any of us, do you?

1:00:01.365 --> 1:00:06.134
N-N-N-No.

1:00:10.474 --> 1:00:13.075
The checks haven't
gone out yet.
That's a win.

1:00:13.143 --> 1:00:15.611
You know, I don't
know which is worse,
you or the sharks.

1:00:15.679 --> 1:00:17.546
At least
you don't see them

1:00:17.615 --> 1:00:19.581
screwing
each other over just
to save a few bucks.

1:00:19.650 --> 1:00:21.149
Give me one good reason

1:00:21.218 --> 1:00:23.051
why we shouldn't
throw you overboard
right now.

1:00:23.120 --> 1:00:25.587
Well, apparently
someone's not listening.

1:00:25.656 --> 1:00:27.623
The checks
haven't gone out yet.

1:00:27.691 --> 1:00:29.157
If you want your check,

1:00:29.226 --> 1:00:30.892
you need it signed by me,

1:00:30.961 --> 1:00:32.995
your captain, your boss,

1:00:33.063 --> 1:00:35.464
your lord and savior!

1:00:35.532 --> 1:00:39.267
So, Sara,
how 'bout that memorial?

1:00:39.336 --> 1:00:41.470
I quit.

1:00:41.538 --> 1:00:43.138
Write it yourself.
What?

1:00:43.207 --> 1:00:45.140
I hate my job.

1:00:45.209 --> 1:00:48.076
You're a terrible boss
and a terrible person,

1:00:48.145 --> 1:00:49.411
and you're
an ugly human being!

1:00:50.981 --> 1:00:52.147
You talking to me?

1:00:52.216 --> 1:00:53.782
You're going
to quit on me?

1:00:53.851 --> 1:00:55.917
You can't quit!

1:00:55.986 --> 1:00:57.419
You can't quit!

1:00:57.488 --> 1:00:59.121
I won't let you quit!

1:00:59.189 --> 1:01:01.523
And if you do,
I will bury you!

1:01:01.592 --> 1:01:03.025
You will be back

Okay. It's over.

Is that a--

Is that a dam?

1:01:46.570 --> 1:01:47.969

1:01:48.038 --> 1:01:49.971
I've never seen anything
like that in my life.

1:01:51.875 --> 1:01:53.208
What? Like I have?

1:01:53.277 --> 1:01:55.043
I've never even seen
a shark until today,

the hell that thing is.

off this river.

to get ourselves
over there?

isn't letting up.

There's still
a ton of those things
out there.

1:04:19.523 --> 1:04:21.756
We need to somehow
draw them over here

1:04:21.825 --> 1:04:24.092
so that Stella
can shoot as many
of them as possible,

1:04:24.161 --> 1:04:26.361
which will then
free us up to paddle

gonna draw 'em in?

I've been thinking
about that.

1:04:57.694 --> 1:05:00.228

Blood? Where are we gonna
get blood, hmm? Hmm?

to hold it together now.

all the paddling?
