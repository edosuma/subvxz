WEBVTT

00:03.200 --> 00:04.200
What are you
working on?

00:04.202 --> 00:06.486
Can't talk.
In the zone.

00:06.488 --> 00:07.487
Do you know
what he's doing?

00:07.489 --> 00:09.122
Could be anything.

00:09.124 --> 00:10.623
Last time he was like this,
he figured out

00:10.625 --> 00:12.274
electron transport in graphene.

00:12.276 --> 00:14.110
The time before that,
he was making a list

00:14.112 --> 00:17.580
of who's allowed in his
tree fort if fe ever gets one.

00:17.582 --> 00:19.999
Still can't believe
I didn't make the cut.

00:20.884 --> 00:22.668
Uh, Sheldon,
you want to take a break?

00:22.670 --> 00:23.636
Your food's ready.

00:23.638 --> 00:25.004
No, no,
what are you doing?

00:25.006 --> 00:27.423
He's both happy and quiet.

00:27.425 --> 00:30.760
It's like seeing a unicorn
and Bigfoot at the same time.

00:31.595 --> 00:33.763
Sorry we're so late.

00:33.765 --> 00:35.014
Bernadette got
stuck at work.

00:35.016 --> 00:36.182
Great news!

00:36.184 --> 00:38.851
A raccoon virus just
crossed the species barrier

00:38.853 --> 00:41.637
and now can infect humans!

00:42.406 --> 00:44.273
Why is that great news?

00:44.275 --> 00:45.992
In the pharmaceutical business,
we have a saying:

00:45.994 --> 00:47.577
"Mo' infections, mo' money."

00:49.029 --> 00:50.312
Wait!

00:50.314 --> 00:51.447
Maybe you want to wash

00:51.449 --> 00:53.116
your little raccoon
hands first.

00:53.118 --> 00:54.150
Oh, calm down.

00:54.152 --> 00:56.035
If I had it,
I'd be dead already.

00:58.422 --> 01:00.006
Guys, listen up.

01:00.008 --> 01:01.374
Can't listen, zone.

01:02.325 --> 01:03.993
Also don't care.

01:03.995 --> 01:05.795
Next week is the anniversary

01:05.797 --> 01:07.346
of my first date
with Bernadette.

01:07.348 --> 01:09.599
Really don't care.

01:09.601 --> 01:10.683
I want to do something special,

01:10.685 --> 01:12.835
and I was hoping
you guys could be a part of it.

01:12.837 --> 01:14.003
Aw, what horrible thing

01:14.005 --> 01:15.888
are you trying
to make up for?

01:15.890 --> 01:17.440
Just putting something
in the bank

01:17.442 --> 01:19.108
for what horrible thing
I do next.

01:19.110 --> 01:21.144
Ah.

01:21.146 --> 01:23.179
Look, she's gonna be back
any second, so here's the deal:

01:23.181 --> 01:24.614
I'm writing a song,
and I was hoping

01:24.616 --> 01:26.315
we could all play it
for her together.

01:26.317 --> 01:27.617
Aw...
Oh, I love that.

01:27.619 --> 01:28.651
That is so beautiful.

01:28.653 --> 01:30.269
Sheldon?

01:31.188 --> 01:33.689

02:04.181 --> 02:06.549
It's really sweet what Howard
wants to do for Bernadette.

02:06.551 --> 02:07.767
Yeah.

02:07.769 --> 02:09.435
Hey, how come you've never
done anything romantic

02:09.437 --> 02:11.604
to celebrate
our first date?

02:11.606 --> 02:14.190
Well, for starters, you've
broken up with me so many times,

02:14.192 --> 02:17.543
which first date
are we talking about?

02:17.545 --> 02:19.812
Ooh, somebody call
the burn ward.

02:21.698 --> 02:23.899
And back to the zone.

02:24.985 --> 02:27.770
And besides, I do romantic
things for you all the time.

02:27.772 --> 02:28.904
Can you even name

02:28.906 --> 02:30.706
one romantic thing
you've done for me?

02:30.708 --> 02:31.657
I can name tons.

02:31.659 --> 02:34.210
Sex doesn't count.
Oh.

02:34.212 --> 02:36.329
I know, what about
that bed-and-breakfast?

02:36.331 --> 02:37.546
Well, I took you there.

02:37.548 --> 02:38.497
All you did was...

02:38.499 --> 02:41.000
I know what I did.

02:41.002 --> 02:43.919
I bet they had to throw
out that rocking chair.

02:45.789 --> 02:48.290
You know, I can be
romantic if I want to.

02:48.292 --> 02:49.592
It's fine.

02:49.594 --> 02:52.511
And also not true.

02:52.513 --> 02:54.397
Okay, just you
wait and see.

02:54.399 --> 02:56.565
I'm gonna romance
your freakin' ass off.

02:57.901 --> 02:59.151
That's beautiful.

02:59.153 --> 03:00.152
Is that Shakespeare?

03:00.154 --> 03:01.970
Sheldon?

03:01.972 --> 03:03.906
Zone.

03:05.075 --> 03:08.310
He'll figure it out when
he falls off the roof.

03:09.496 --> 03:12.031
Sheldon, I know
you're in the zone,

03:12.033 --> 03:13.916
but do you
want some tea?

03:18.071 --> 03:20.172
All right, I can't believe
I'm gonna say this,

03:20.174 --> 03:21.674
but you haven't
spoken in hours

03:21.676 --> 03:23.158
and I'm starting
to get worried.

03:23.160 --> 03:24.159
Please say something.

03:24.161 --> 03:26.262
Leonard, prepare
to be humbled

03:26.264 --> 03:29.548
and weep at the glory
of my genius.

03:30.767 --> 03:32.768
Nope, it was better before.

03:34.104 --> 03:35.438
Look at it.

03:35.440 --> 03:39.275
I feel like my mind
just made a baby.

03:39.277 --> 03:41.560
And it's beautiful.

03:41.562 --> 03:43.011
It's not like human babies,

03:43.013 --> 03:44.964
which are loud
and covered in goop.

03:46.349 --> 03:48.016
Holy crap, Sheldon,

03:48.018 --> 03:49.668
did you just
figure out a method

03:49.670 --> 03:52.488
for synthesizing a new stable
super-heavy element?

03:52.490 --> 03:54.540
Did I?

03:54.542 --> 03:56.092
Well, that can't
be right.

03:56.094 --> 03:57.460
No one's ever done that before.

03:57.462 --> 03:59.128
Except me,
because I just did it!

03:59.130 --> 04:01.530
♪ Sheldon and
his brain-- yeah! ♪

04:01.532 --> 04:03.249
♪ Sheldon and his brain--

04:07.805 --> 04:09.839
Yeah, definitely better before.

04:11.058 --> 04:13.676
So I'm almost done writing
the song for Bernadette.

04:13.678 --> 04:15.043
Are you cool
playing the cello?

04:15.045 --> 04:17.897
If by "cool" you mean
"willing to," yes.

04:17.899 --> 04:19.849
If by "cool"
you mean "cool,"

04:19.851 --> 04:21.884
clearly you've never
seen me play the cello.

04:22.569 --> 04:24.520
Great.
Will you play the ukulele?

04:24.522 --> 04:27.406
Of course. I'd be happy
to shred it on my ax.

04:28.942 --> 04:31.861
Or you could just play
your tiny, ridiculous guitar.

04:34.698 --> 04:37.666
Fine. I will
melt her heart.

04:37.668 --> 04:40.068
And her face!

04:41.171 --> 04:43.038
Gentlemen.

04:43.040 --> 04:45.424
Uh, no doubt you heard about
my little breakthrough.

04:45.426 --> 04:47.343
Now, if your plan

04:47.345 --> 04:48.961
is to hoist me
on your shoulders

04:48.963 --> 04:51.246
and carry me around the
cafeteria, please refrain.

04:51.248 --> 04:52.548
I don't care
for heights,

04:52.550 --> 04:53.799
motion sickness

04:53.801 --> 04:56.552
or the thought of your necks
touching my buttocks.

04:58.021 --> 05:00.473
Seriously,
congratulations, Sheldon.

05:00.475 --> 05:02.024
Yeah, I read
your paper online.

05:02.026 --> 05:04.310
That technique for creating
a new heavy element is inspired.

05:04.312 --> 05:05.311
Oh, well, thank you.

05:05.313 --> 05:06.445
Believe it or not,

05:06.447 --> 05:08.531
I just learned
a Chinese research team

05:08.533 --> 05:10.282
at the Hubei Institute
for Nuclear Physics

05:10.284 --> 05:12.151
ran a test on a cyclotron,

05:12.153 --> 05:14.153
and the results were
extremely promising.

05:14.155 --> 05:16.122
Sheldon,
that's incredible.

05:16.124 --> 05:18.273
Yeah, I know! They called it
the greatest thing

05:18.275 --> 05:20.209
since the Communist party.

05:21.211 --> 05:22.294
Although I'm pretty sure that

05:22.296 --> 05:24.046
the Communist party
made them say that.

05:25.281 --> 05:26.916
I like China.

05:26.918 --> 05:29.284
See, they know how to keep
people in line.

05:30.670 --> 05:32.120
So, what happens next?

05:32.122 --> 05:35.090
Oh, more testing,
more success, more fame.

05:35.092 --> 05:36.142
But don't worry,

05:36.144 --> 05:39.094
I will remain the same
down-to-earth humble Joe

05:39.096 --> 05:41.180
I've always been.

05:41.182 --> 05:42.297
- Good to know.
- Yeah.

05:42.299 --> 05:43.399
Now give me
that cookie;

05:43.401 --> 05:46.352
I discovered an element.

05:47.521 --> 05:49.722
Thank you so much
for coming.

05:49.724 --> 05:51.490
You called the right person.

05:51.492 --> 05:52.942
I believe I have
the perfect romantic evening

05:52.944 --> 05:53.993
for you to give Leonard.

05:53.995 --> 05:55.077
Okay, good,
'cause I've been

05:55.079 --> 05:56.695
really struggling
with this.

05:56.697 --> 05:57.947
As I'm sure you're aware,

05:57.949 --> 06:00.616
the quickest way to a man's
heart is through his...

06:00.618 --> 06:03.619
Pants, but Leonard says
sex doesn't count.

06:04.454 --> 06:05.754
Oh. You poor thing.

06:05.756 --> 06:07.489
You have one arrow
in your quiver,

06:07.491 --> 06:09.074
and you just can't use it.

06:10.460 --> 06:13.161
Fortunately, another
pathway to a man's heart

06:13.163 --> 06:15.764
is through his stomach.

06:15.766 --> 06:17.266
I don't know if
I want to cook for him;

06:17.268 --> 06:18.267
he's kind of a picky eater.

06:18.269 --> 06:19.685
I mean,
"It's too salty.

06:19.687 --> 06:21.053
"It's too dry.

06:21.055 --> 06:24.006
It's too burnt and frozen
at the same time."

06:24.975 --> 06:25.975
Wait, come on,

06:25.977 --> 06:27.393
what else would
sweep you off your feet?

06:27.395 --> 06:29.645
Well, I've always had
this fantasy

06:29.647 --> 06:30.946
that involves dancing.

06:30.948 --> 06:33.515
The sexual chemistry

06:33.517 --> 06:36.285
between my partner and me
is electric.

06:36.287 --> 06:37.636
But boy, oh, boy,

06:37.638 --> 06:38.921
does my father not approve

06:38.923 --> 06:41.857
until he sees us
in the big dance competition.

06:42.926 --> 06:44.994
Okay, that's just
the plot for <i>Dirty Dancing.</i>

06:46.830 --> 06:48.214
What else would you love?

06:48.216 --> 06:51.000
Other than being lifted over
Patrick Swayze's head.

06:51.002 --> 06:54.036
Oh! Oh, uh, you could, uh,
stand outside his window

06:54.038 --> 06:56.989
with a boom box in the air.

06:59.109 --> 07:01.210
That's from <i>Say Anything.</i>

07:01.212 --> 07:04.847
Look, I'm a lonely guy;
I watch a lot of movies.

07:06.050 --> 07:09.001
Look, Penny, if you truly
want to be romantic,

07:09.003 --> 07:10.569
it needs to come
from you.

07:10.571 --> 07:12.771
I get that,
but why is this so hard?

07:12.773 --> 07:14.773
Well, you've probably
never had to do this stuff

07:14.775 --> 07:15.908
'cause you're
young and beautiful

07:15.910 --> 07:17.776
and men have always thrown
themselves at you.

07:17.778 --> 07:19.778
Hmm.

07:19.780 --> 07:21.714
Yeah, I'm trying
to be sad about that.

07:21.716 --> 07:23.115
I can't.

07:27.454 --> 07:29.538
Let's see,
what's next?

07:29.540 --> 07:30.506
Okay! Here.

07:30.508 --> 07:32.424
This is
the Magic Marker

07:32.426 --> 07:34.677
I was using when
I made the discovery.

07:36.245 --> 07:38.847
I don't think the Smithsonian's
gonna want your marker.

07:38.849 --> 07:42.468
And that's why you're not
on a list for my tree fort.

07:46.090 --> 07:48.140
Ooh, guess who's
getting an article

07:48.142 --> 07:49.925
written about him
in <i>Physics Today?</i>

07:49.927 --> 07:51.477
I'll give you a hint.

07:51.479 --> 07:54.730
You measured the diameter of
his suspicious mole yesterday.

07:56.616 --> 07:58.417
Sheldon, I'm so proud of you.

07:58.419 --> 07:59.434
Well, you should be.

07:59.436 --> 08:01.487
My discovery is
spreading like wildfire.

08:01.489 --> 08:03.238
Unlike my mole,
which is holding steady

08:03.240 --> 08:05.207
at the size of
a navy bean.

08:06.876 --> 08:08.127
What's next?

08:08.129 --> 08:09.995
This is
the very copy

08:09.997 --> 08:11.830
of <i>The Handbook of</i>
<i>Chemistry and Physics</i>

08:11.832 --> 08:13.832
in which I looked up
the reaction rates

08:13.834 --> 08:16.051
of mendelevium and...

08:17.737 --> 08:19.688
And what?
No.

08:20.757 --> 08:22.658
No, no, no, no.

08:22.660 --> 08:23.676
What's wrong?

08:25.929 --> 08:27.680
I've made a horrible mistake.

08:27.682 --> 08:28.847
What are you talking about?

08:28.849 --> 08:31.633
This table--
it's in square centimeters.

08:31.635 --> 08:33.519
I read it as square meters.

08:33.520 --> 08:35.070
You know what that means?

08:35.072 --> 08:37.639
That Americans can't handle
the metric system?

08:39.192 --> 08:43.028
Amy, I was off by
a factor of 10,000.

08:43.030 --> 08:45.914
But the Chinese team
found the element.

08:45.916 --> 08:46.999
Yeah, well, they shouldn't have.

08:47.001 --> 08:48.450
My calculations were wrong.

08:48.452 --> 08:49.985
There must be some resonance

08:49.987 --> 08:51.704
between the elements
I didn't know about.

08:51.706 --> 08:53.372
So you just got lucky?

08:53.374 --> 08:55.657
Sheldon Cooper
does not get lucky!

08:57.961 --> 09:00.295
You and me both, brother.

09:01.214 --> 09:02.464
It doesn't matter.

09:02.466 --> 09:04.499
The element was found
because of you,

09:04.501 --> 09:05.634
and that's groundbreaking.

09:05.636 --> 09:06.719
What matters is

09:06.721 --> 09:08.187
the greatest
scientific achievement

09:08.189 --> 09:10.338
of my life is
based on a blunder.

09:10.340 --> 09:13.275
I'm not a genius,
I'm a fraud.

09:14.060 --> 09:15.644
You know, Sheldon,
in neuroscience,

09:15.646 --> 09:17.946
we're forever finding something
in one part of the brain

09:17.948 --> 09:19.481
that we thought was
someplace else.

09:19.483 --> 09:20.783
Oh, great.

09:20.785 --> 09:22.534
Now I'm worse
than a fraud.

09:22.536 --> 09:24.286
I'm practically
a biologist.

09:26.000 --> 09:32.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

09:34.135 --> 09:36.303
You got to stop beating
yourself up over this.

09:36.305 --> 09:39.223
I mean, you made a mistake,
but it was a happy mistake.

09:39.225 --> 09:40.925
There's nothing happy about it.

09:40.927 --> 09:43.861
I'm being given credit
that I don't deserve.

09:43.863 --> 09:46.831
Oh, people get things
they don't deserve all the time.

09:46.833 --> 09:49.433
Look at me with you.

09:49.435 --> 09:51.151
No, Leonard,
this is going to haunt me

09:51.153 --> 09:52.386
for the rest of my life.

09:52.388 --> 09:54.071
Every science classroom,

09:54.073 --> 09:56.740
every periodic table,
every textbook--

09:56.742 --> 09:59.577
this mistake will be
staring back at me

09:59.579 --> 10:03.447
Like that time you let
Koothrappali wax your eyebrows.

10:04.666 --> 10:07.618
I've got to find a way
to stop this thing.

10:07.620 --> 10:09.236
Buddy, I don't
think you can.

10:09.238 --> 10:11.288
I mean, once it's out there,
it's out there.

10:11.290 --> 10:15.509
This thing is like the science
equivalent of a sex tape.

10:15.511 --> 10:18.012
You know, frankly,
I'd prefer a sex tape.

10:18.014 --> 10:19.847
You don't know
what a sex tape is, do you?

10:19.849 --> 10:21.248
No.

10:23.685 --> 10:25.636
Make sure you guys get
to the restaurant by 8:00.

10:25.638 --> 10:27.087
Bernadette's meeting
me there at 8:30

10:27.089 --> 10:29.189
and I don't want to blow the surprise.
We'll be there.

10:29.191 --> 10:30.391
Got it.

10:30.393 --> 10:32.693
Now, uh, I have a question
about the song.

10:32.695 --> 10:34.144
I was thinking
at some point

10:34.146 --> 10:36.597
I could bust out
a little rap.

10:37.449 --> 10:40.434
N-N-N-No...

10:43.738 --> 10:46.273
Come on, come on, you
haven't even heard it yet.

10:46.275 --> 10:47.825
Leonard,
give me a beat.

10:47.827 --> 10:49.627
I will not.

10:50.945 --> 10:52.079
Please?

10:52.081 --> 10:53.914
No, I want this
to be romantic.

10:53.916 --> 10:54.948
It will be!

10:54.950 --> 10:56.467
I don't call
anyone a ho,

10:56.469 --> 10:58.802
and the only time I use
the phrase "my bitch,"

10:58.804 --> 11:01.672
I'm referring to you.

11:01.674 --> 11:03.591
There he is!

11:06.227 --> 11:07.461
Stop it.

11:07.463 --> 11:08.962
Stop celebrating me!

11:08.964 --> 11:10.681
Woo!

11:10.683 --> 11:12.566
And no woos!

11:12.568 --> 11:14.635
Oh, not you, Dr. Woo.
You're fine.

11:17.939 --> 11:19.740
I want you all to know

11:19.742 --> 11:22.109
that you have no reason
to applaud me.

11:22.111 --> 11:24.361
My so-called
breakthrough

11:24.363 --> 11:25.913
wasn't the result of my genius.

11:25.915 --> 11:28.332
It was nothing more than
a boneheaded mistake.

11:28.334 --> 11:30.150
So please refrain

11:30.152 --> 11:32.169
from praising me for it
in the future.

11:32.171 --> 11:33.287
Wh... I don't understand.

11:33.289 --> 11:34.505
They didn't find the element?

11:34.507 --> 11:36.657
Oh, no, they found the element.

11:36.659 --> 11:39.159
No, no, stop it!

11:39.161 --> 11:40.327
I don't need
to take this admiration

11:40.329 --> 11:42.346
from the likes
of you people!

11:42.348 --> 11:44.965
How do I make them
stop loving me?

11:44.967 --> 11:47.217
Invite them
to live with us.

11:51.223 --> 11:53.173
Boy, Bernadette is
gonna love this.

11:53.175 --> 11:55.059
Yeah. It must be nice
to have someone

11:55.061 --> 11:57.277
do something
so romantic.

11:57.279 --> 11:59.513
Okay, you know
what's not romantic?

11:59.515 --> 12:01.181
Rubbing it in someone's face.

12:01.183 --> 12:02.282
Actually, it can be,

12:02.284 --> 12:04.652
but I told you
sex doesn't count.

12:06.321 --> 12:08.789
I'm getting worried
about Bernadette.

12:08.791 --> 12:11.358
I'm gonna call
and check on her.

12:11.360 --> 12:13.043
The National Science Foundation

12:13.045 --> 12:14.912
wants to give me
a substantial grant.

12:14.914 --> 12:16.363
Oh, that's a big deal.

12:16.365 --> 12:17.381
I know.

12:17.383 --> 12:20.334
When will this
nightmare end?

12:20.336 --> 12:22.553
Hey, I get that you feel bad
about all the attention,

12:22.555 --> 12:24.388
but still,
what you did is amazing.

12:24.390 --> 12:25.756
We're really proud of you.

12:25.758 --> 12:26.807
I'm not.

12:27.676 --> 12:28.875
You're not?

12:28.877 --> 12:31.562
Sheldon, I've been
thinking about it,

12:31.564 --> 12:32.879
and you're right.

12:32.881 --> 12:34.348
You don't deserve
any credit.

12:34.350 --> 12:37.551
All you did was misread
some numbers on a table.

12:37.553 --> 12:39.386
A very easy table, too.

12:39.388 --> 12:42.773
Honestly, I'm
embarrassed for you.

12:44.859 --> 12:47.227
That's the most romantic thing
I've ever heard.

12:48.863 --> 12:52.299
Damn it, everyone's better
at this than me.

12:52.301 --> 12:54.334
Congratulations,
Dr. Fowler.

12:54.336 --> 12:56.020
You just made the fort.

12:58.206 --> 13:01.508
Guys, there w-was
an accident at Bernie's lab.

13:01.510 --> 13:03.293
Oh, my God,
is she okay?

13:03.295 --> 13:05.546
Yeah, but she's at
the hospital in quarantine.

13:05.548 --> 13:06.597
What?
Poor Bernadette.

13:06.599 --> 13:07.881
Oh, no.

13:07.883 --> 13:11.051
I hate to pile on the bad news,
but I just got a raise.

13:19.477 --> 13:22.362
Oh, my God, Bernie,
what happened?

13:22.364 --> 13:24.598
Well, let's just say
the next time you move

13:24.600 --> 13:29.036
a dozen vials of raccoon virus
to the fridge, make two trips.

13:29.954 --> 13:31.555
You're sure you're okay?

13:31.557 --> 13:32.956
Yeah, it's just a precaution.

13:32.958 --> 13:34.241
If there was a problem,

13:34.243 --> 13:36.994
I'd be throwing up
out of my eyeballs by now.

13:38.279 --> 13:39.663
Sorry I messed up our date.

13:39.665 --> 13:40.831
, don't worry
about it.

13:40.833 --> 13:42.750
I brought the
date here.

13:42.752 --> 13:45.552
Guys, come on in.

13:45.554 --> 13:46.637
What's all this?

13:46.639 --> 13:50.290
Well, tonight is the anniversary
of our first date,

13:50.292 --> 13:54.011
and I wanted to celebrate it
by writing a song for you.

13:54.013 --> 13:55.229
Howie.

13:55.231 --> 13:57.264
Sheldon,
get over here!

13:57.266 --> 13:59.900
She might be contagious.

14:01.069 --> 14:03.320
Don't you think I'm having
a rough enough day?

16:39.428 --> 16:41.595
She's sick,
I knew it. Bye!

16:45.767 --> 16:47.467
I have to say,

16:47.469 --> 16:50.988
this is the best Top Ramen
you've ever made.

16:50.990 --> 16:52.823
I discovered
a secret ingredient:

16:52.825 --> 16:54.741
the flavor packet.

16:55.326 --> 16:58.278
That sucker is well named.

16:59.480 --> 17:01.665
All right, lover boy.

17:01.667 --> 17:04.166
Get ready, 'cause there is
a crap storm of romance

17:04.169 --> 17:06.086
coming your way.

17:06.088 --> 17:08.488
Stop it,
you're gonna make me cry.

17:11.292 --> 17:13.260
All right. You seem
pretty confident.

17:13.262 --> 17:14.661
Oh, I am.

17:14.663 --> 17:18.298
Maybe if you follow this trail,

17:18.300 --> 17:20.183
you'll see why.

17:20.185 --> 17:21.818
Oh, rose petals.

17:21.819 --> 17:22.786
Yes.

17:22.788 --> 17:24.054
The most beautiful

17:24.056 --> 17:26.339
and shockingly expensive
of all the flowers.

17:29.343 --> 17:30.560
You made the bed?

17:30.562 --> 17:33.530
You really are pulling
out all the stops.

17:33.532 --> 17:36.033
Okay, I gave this
a lot of thought,

17:36.035 --> 17:38.402
and I finally found
something to show you

17:38.404 --> 17:40.370
how much I love you.

17:44.792 --> 17:46.877
Oh, wow.

17:46.879 --> 17:48.128
It's a first edition of

17:48.130 --> 17:49.880
<i>Hitchhiker's Guide</i>
<i>to the Galaxy.</i>

17:49.882 --> 17:53.050
I remember it was
your favorite book growing up.

17:53.885 --> 17:55.135
This is great.

17:55.137 --> 17:56.503
It... thank you.

17:56.505 --> 17:58.055
It's... so much.

17:58.057 --> 18:00.807
What?

18:00.809 --> 18:02.926
Nothing. I love it.
No.

18:02.928 --> 18:04.261
Something's going on.
What's wrong with it?

18:04.263 --> 18:06.146
I remember you saying
how great it would be

18:06.148 --> 18:07.264
to have a first edition.

18:07.266 --> 18:09.149
It's true, I-I did.

18:09.151 --> 18:10.484
I did say that...

18:10.486 --> 18:13.153
when we were at the used
bookstore together

18:13.155 --> 18:16.656
and I saw the first
edition and I bought it.

18:17.825 --> 18:21.194
Oh, my God,
I am the worst!

18:21.196 --> 18:22.913
No, no, it's okay.
It's really thoughtful.

18:22.915 --> 18:25.565
No, it's not! I mean...

18:25.567 --> 18:28.401
What's thoughtful
is everything you do.

18:29.754 --> 18:32.039
Here, you know what?
Look at this.

18:34.709 --> 18:36.510
Look, here's the...
the plane ticket you bought me

18:36.512 --> 18:38.712
when I was too poor
to go home for the holidays.

18:38.714 --> 18:41.431
And the rose you left
on my windshield...

18:41.433 --> 18:43.633
just because.

18:43.635 --> 18:45.552
Here's the-the thank-you
letter you wrote me

18:45.554 --> 18:47.554
after the first time
I slept with you.

18:48.923 --> 18:51.892
All 11 pages of it.

18:52.860 --> 18:55.896
Can't believe
you saved all this stuff.

18:56.764 --> 18:58.281
Of course I did.

18:58.283 --> 18:59.783
It's you.

19:00.618 --> 19:02.569
Come here.

19:05.039 --> 19:06.239
Oh.

19:07.992 --> 19:10.460
Is that
a pregnancy test?

19:10.462 --> 19:11.828
Oh, yeah,
just the first one.

19:11.830 --> 19:13.296
I didn't save them all.

19:21.979 --> 19:25.615
I can't believe I read
this table wrong.

19:25.617 --> 19:28.468
I blame you.

19:28.470 --> 19:30.753
Me? What did I do?

19:30.755 --> 19:32.205
You distract me.

19:32.207 --> 19:35.041
I've been distracted since
the moment I met you.

19:35.876 --> 19:37.627
Sorry.

19:37.629 --> 19:38.795
Well, you should be.

19:38.797 --> 19:40.430
Because all I
can think about

19:40.432 --> 19:43.099
is how much I want
to kiss you.

19:45.436 --> 19:48.554
And not just on the cheek,
but on the mouth.

19:51.892 --> 19:54.110
Like mommies
and daddies do.

19:57.448 --> 19:59.699
Oh, Sheldon.

20:02.903 --> 20:05.121
<i>Amy?</i>

20:07.574 --> 20:10.126
Amy.

20:10.128 --> 20:11.944
Did you hear
what I said?

20:11.946 --> 20:13.346
Can't talk, in the zone.
