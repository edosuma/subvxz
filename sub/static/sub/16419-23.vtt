00:16.167 --> 00:17.566
- Geez louise.

00:17.567 --> 00:20.199
What kind of people
would do such a thing?

00:20.200 --> 00:23.033
- Ha ha!
- Ha ha heh.

00:25.933 --> 00:27.399
- Uhhh...
- Babe! Trip!

00:27.400 --> 00:30.732
Those guys are here to
install security cameras.

00:30.733 --> 00:32.466
- Wh-why?

00:32.467 --> 00:34.799
- Ugh!
Didn't you see our door?

00:34.800 --> 00:36.699
- Whoa!
- Whoa, yikes!

00:36.700 --> 00:37.700
- What happened to it?!

00:37.701 --> 00:40.066
- Burglars!

00:40.067 --> 00:41.499
Yeah, when I got in
this morning,

00:41.500 --> 00:43.299
I saw that some criminals
broke in last night

00:43.300 --> 00:45.532
and stole the dishwasher
right out of our kitchen.

00:45.533 --> 00:46.899
- Oh muffins!

00:46.900 --> 00:49.633
- Oh my God I want a cranberry.

00:50.867 --> 00:53.199
Ooo, so what do we have here?

00:53.200 --> 00:55.166
- Mmmm, Kenzie brought
us some muffins

00:55.167 --> 00:58.732
and these awesome Jewish donuts.

00:58.733 --> 01:00.699
- Doesn't anybody care?!?

01:00.700 --> 01:03.232
- What are we supposed
to care about?

01:03.233 --> 01:06.166
- That we've been burglarized!

01:06.167 --> 01:09.499
That's why I'm upgrading
our security system.

01:09.500 --> 01:12.299
- Oh, well,
what'd the burglars steal?

01:12.300 --> 01:14.300
- Our dishwasher!

01:16.433 --> 01:18.499
- Wait...
they jacked our dishwasher,

01:18.500 --> 01:20.299
and didn't touch
our computers or anything?

01:20.300 --> 01:23.366
- That's right.

01:23.367 --> 01:26.832
- Hey, hey...
That is too much cream cheese.

01:26.833 --> 01:30.066
- What, but I...
- No, I don't want to hear it...

01:30.067 --> 01:31.599
- No, I...
- No, no...

01:31.600 --> 01:33.499
- Hey! We're back.

01:33.500 --> 01:36.099
- Here we are!
- Good morning!

01:36.100 --> 01:37.466
- Oh hey Dub.
- Hey, what's up, Dad?

01:37.467 --> 01:39.466
- Hey, Just set it over
there by the kitchen.

01:39.467 --> 01:41.366
I'm gonna get me some Jonjerale.

01:41.367 --> 01:44.099
- Wh... what is...
Hey, that's our dishwasher!

01:44.100 --> 01:45.499
- Well my goodness,

01:45.500 --> 01:48.500
you certainly do know
your kitchen appliances.

01:51.067 --> 01:54.899
- That's... Okay, last night,
somebody broke in here

01:54.900 --> 01:56.066
and stole that!

01:56.067 --> 01:58.100
- Uh, borrowed.

02:00.067 --> 02:01.466
- Wait...

02:01.467 --> 02:03.832
so you guys are the ones
who smashed our door?

02:03.833 --> 02:06.866
- Smashed it easy!

02:06.867 --> 02:08.266
- Well why?

02:08.267 --> 02:10.266
- 'Cuz we didn't have a key.

02:10.267 --> 02:11.899
- No... Dad...

02:11.900 --> 02:13.966
why did you guys bust in here
in the middle of the night

02:13.967 --> 02:15.966
and "borrow" our dishwasher?

02:15.967 --> 02:17.466
- Well, you see, last night,

02:17.467 --> 02:18.899
Bunny and Ruthless
was drivin' a pickup truck

02:18.900 --> 02:20.132
fulla cash to the house.

02:20.133 --> 02:22.532
- Why a pickup truck
full of cash?

02:22.533 --> 02:26.932
- 'Cuz you can fit a lotta cash
in the back of a pickup truck!

02:26.933 --> 02:28.332
- Ahhh.
- That is true.

02:28.333 --> 02:29.566
- Then, when we stopped
at a stoplight,

02:29.567 --> 02:31.899
there was a skunk on the road.

02:31.900 --> 02:34.532
- The skunk sprayed the truck!

02:34.533 --> 02:36.632
- Yeah, so when they brought
the money into my house,

02:36.633 --> 02:38.666
it stunk!

02:38.667 --> 02:40.966
- Right, and how did that
lead to you guys

02:40.967 --> 02:44.866
breaking in here
and jacking our dishwasher?

02:44.867 --> 02:47.499
- Ah, well to clean
the stank off my cash,

02:47.500 --> 02:51.099
we tried puttin' it
in the dishwasher!

02:51.100 --> 02:52.632
- Well why didn't you use yours?

02:52.633 --> 02:56.666
- We did!
Dub's dishwasher broke!

02:56.667 --> 02:59.099
- So he said we should
come here and borrow yours.

02:59.100 --> 03:02.432
- Yours broke too!

03:02.433 --> 03:04.400
- Here's some money
to fix your dishwasher.

03:08.067 --> 03:09.799
- Eww! Gross!

03:09.800 --> 03:12.899
- Dad, you can't go around
giving people money that stinks.

03:12.900 --> 03:15.799
- Well, how am I supposed
to get the stank out?

03:15.800 --> 03:17.766
- Uh, you could maybe...

03:17.767 --> 03:19.899
- What if you took the
money to a bank and...

03:19.900 --> 03:23.332
- Hey! I'll get the stank
outta your money for ya.

03:23.333 --> 03:25.199
- How are you gonna
get the smell out?

03:25.200 --> 03:27.767
- Ancient Hudson secret.

03:30.667 --> 03:34.066
- All right Hubbins,
tell ya what:

03:34.067 --> 03:37.332
I'ma have Bunny and Ruthless
bring all the stank money here,

03:37.333 --> 03:39.066
and if you can
get the stank out,

03:39.067 --> 03:41.966
you can keep a thousand bucks
for yourself.

03:41.967 --> 03:43.966
- Deal!

03:43.967 --> 03:45.599
- Wait, how much money
are we talkin' here?

03:45.600 --> 03:47.366
- I don't know,
I think it was about

03:47.367 --> 03:48.399
200 thousand, right?

03:48.400 --> 03:50.799
- 400 thousand.

03:50.800 --> 03:52.800
- Geez Louise!
- Dang Dad!

03:54.800 --> 03:56.666
- Hey hey, whoa whoa...

03:56.667 --> 03:59.899
who was trying to wash
that in our dishwasher?

03:59.900 --> 04:01.966
- What?
- Whatcha mean?

04:01.967 --> 04:03.700
- Oh... uh!

04:10.367 --> 04:13.332
I've had him since I was 12.

- Well, uh, how do you
feel about Kenzie,

05:04.700 --> 05:05.899
and all those cameras
she put in?

05:05.900 --> 05:08.232
- I think she's
a little outta control.

05:08.233 --> 05:10.299
- Right?

05:10.300 --> 05:11.899
I mean, I get that
she wants to make sure

05:11.900 --> 05:13.766
we don't get robbed
but it's like,

05:13.767 --> 05:15.266
whenever I'm tryin' to work,
all I can think about

05:15.267 --> 05:17.066
are those security cameras
all pointed at me.

05:17.067 --> 05:19.799
- Yeah, it's a little weird.
- I know.

05:19.800 --> 05:22.466
I feel like I can't even have
a private conversation,

05:22.467 --> 05:24.533
'cuz I'm always
wonderin' if like...

05:29.133 --> 05:31.532
- What's wrong?

05:31.533 --> 05:33.066
- Uhhh...

05:33.067 --> 05:34.866
There's a camera right
behind us, up on the wall.

05:34.867 --> 05:38.199
- Where, right behind m...
- Don't look don't look!

05:38.200 --> 05:40.199
- Well, just ignore it.

05:40.200 --> 05:41.966
- How am I supposed
to ignore somebody

05:41.967 --> 05:44.232
who's always watchin' me,
and everything I do?

05:44.233 --> 05:47.833
- Well, is the camera
pointed right at us, right now?

05:51.400 --> 05:54.699
Yeah, pretty much.

05:54.700 --> 05:56.632
- All right,
then let's walk over there

05:56.633 --> 05:58.066
so the camera won't see us.

05:58.067 --> 05:59.167
-'Kay-kay.

06:04.533 --> 06:07.066
- Hey. That camera just moved.
Did you see that?

06:07.067 --> 06:09.266
- Yeah.
Let's walk over there.

06:09.267 --> 06:10.833
- 'Kay-kay.

06:14.867 --> 06:17.299
It did it again!
It did it again!

06:17.300 --> 06:20.532
- This is pretty creepy.
- I told you.

06:20.533 --> 06:23.566
- Wait...
Why are we whispering?

06:23.567 --> 06:25.199
- Hush!

06:25.200 --> 06:27.066
'Cuz what if the cameras
have microphones?

06:27.067 --> 06:28.432
And what if Kenzie's
listenin' to us?

06:28.433 --> 06:29.866
- Wh...? No no no...
Those are just cameras.

06:29.867 --> 06:31.066
She can't hear us.

06:31.067 --> 06:31.900
- Yes I can.

06:31.901 --> 06:33.200
- Ahhh!
- Ah geez!

06:35.367 --> 06:36.399
- Are you kidding?

06:36.400 --> 06:38.132
- Keep talking.

06:38.133 --> 06:41.367
- Come on, Kenzie.
- You are outta control!

06:45.133 --> 06:47.099
- Hey, I think
I fixed our dishwasher.

06:47.100 --> 06:50.333
- Yeah, that sounds good, okay.

06:53.233 --> 06:55.967
- Lemme just give it
a shot here...

07:03.067 --> 07:05.666
- Hey Kenzie...
Kenzie...

07:05.667 --> 07:06.932
- Oh hi.

07:06.933 --> 07:08.432
- You can't do this, okay?

07:08.433 --> 07:10.132
You're a little outta control.

07:10.133 --> 07:11.299
- How?

07:11.300 --> 07:14.632
- With all these
crazy security cameras.

07:14.633 --> 07:17.066
- Uh, these security cameras

07:17.067 --> 07:19.899
are keeping us safe
from criminals.

07:19.900 --> 07:21.499
- That part's okay,

07:21.500 --> 07:23.232
but you can't sit around
spying on us all the time.

07:23.233 --> 07:26.066
- Yeah, like...
I mean, not that I would,

07:26.067 --> 07:28.666
but like, what if
I needed to pick my nose?

07:28.667 --> 07:32.100
- You mean like you did today,
on camera seven, at 10:42 A.M.?

07:34.133 --> 07:37.499
- I... I did not!
That's not true!

07:37.500 --> 07:40.532
- Okay, well let's check
the footage and see.

07:40.533 --> 07:42.300
- What?!?

07:45.200 --> 07:48.632
- All right, I don't think
you need to check the footage.

07:48.633 --> 07:50.066
- Thank you!

07:53.400 --> 07:55.100
- Don't look at me!

08:00.433 --> 08:02.067
- Here it is!

08:08.767 --> 08:11.566
- Oh wow, look at that.

08:11.567 --> 08:12.899
- Oh...

08:12.900 --> 08:15.467
This is an invasion
of my nasal privacy.

08:16.900 --> 08:18.932
- Shall I press play?

08:18.933 --> 08:22.432
- You shall press off.

08:22.433 --> 08:23.632
- Okaaaaay.

08:23.633 --> 08:26.299
- I swear, I just
scratched my nose.

08:26.300 --> 08:28.400
- Yeah...
You go wash that finger.

08:31.600 --> 08:35.066
- All right, Kenzie Bell,

08:35.067 --> 08:37.599
I want you to listen to me...

08:37.600 --> 08:39.466
- I'm not sure I want to.

08:39.467 --> 08:42.866
- You can keep all your
little security cameras...

08:42.867 --> 08:44.199
But you can't spy on anyone!

08:44.200 --> 08:49.232
Now promise me:
no spying, on anyone, ever.

08:49.233 --> 08:50.699
- Okaaay.

08:50.700 --> 08:52.433
- Butt-swear.

09:00.267 --> 09:01.399
- Hey!

09:01.400 --> 09:04.066
What are you all
butt-swearin' about?

09:04.067 --> 09:05.532
- Don't worry about it.

09:05.533 --> 09:06.666
- Hey, where's Hubbins?

09:06.667 --> 09:08.132
- I'm on my way.

09:08.133 --> 09:10.067
Here's your favorite coffee mug.

09:13.867 --> 09:15.132
- All right,
you said you could get

09:15.133 --> 09:17.133
the skunk smell
outta my money, so...

09:19.133 --> 09:21.199
- Awwww!
- Man!

09:21.200 --> 09:23.267
- Geez Louise!
- Nasty!

09:26.067 --> 09:27.333
- I kinda like it.

09:38.233 --> 09:40.799
- I'm just sayin'...
I didn't pick it.

09:40.800 --> 09:43.366
- It doesn't matter.

09:43.367 --> 09:45.332
- I just don't want you
to think I'd do that.

09:45.333 --> 09:48.932
- I don't.

09:48.933 --> 09:51.399
Even if ya did.

09:51.400 --> 09:52.599
- D'awww.

09:52.600 --> 09:54.266
Kenzie and her
dumb security cameras.

09:54.267 --> 09:56.099
- Forget about her cameras.

09:56.100 --> 09:57.866
She promised she
wouldn't spy anymore.

09:57.867 --> 09:59.299
- And you believe her?

09:59.300 --> 10:01.533
- Uh, yeah... we butt-swore.

10:03.767 --> 10:05.166
- Man, what's up
with the lights?

10:05.167 --> 10:06.966
- I dunno, it's just
a New York subway thing.

10:06.967 --> 10:08.332
- I guess.

10:08.333 --> 10:09.932
- Anyway, I don't think
you need to worry

10:09.933 --> 10:11.266
about Kenzie spying
on us anymore.

10:11.267 --> 10:14.666
- Okay...
but what if she does?

10:14.667 --> 10:17.766
I mean, how are we gonna know
if she's spyin' on us or not?

10:17.767 --> 10:19.866
- You wanna test her?

10:19.867 --> 10:21.199
- How could we test her?

10:21.200 --> 10:22.899
- Y'know...
we tempt her...

10:22.900 --> 10:24.032
see if she bites.

10:24.033 --> 10:27.299
- Ah...
yeah, we could like...

10:27.300 --> 10:29.499
- Dangus to star ship!
Dangus to star ship!

10:29.500 --> 10:31.566
Hurry!
Beam me up!

10:31.567 --> 10:32.732
There's not much time!

10:32.733 --> 10:34.766
Beam me aboard!

10:34.767 --> 10:36.099
- Hey! Buddy.
- Sir!

10:36.100 --> 10:37.666
- What do you want?!?

10:37.667 --> 10:40.266
- That's not a walkie talkie.

10:40.267 --> 10:43.766
- You're talkin'
into a Nut-N-Fruity bar.

10:43.767 --> 10:44.767
- Wrong!

10:44.768 --> 10:47.999
I'm from the future.

10:48.000 --> 10:51.099
And I've got to get
back to my star ship!

10:51.100 --> 10:53.032
Now quick!
Energize!

10:53.033 --> 10:55.200
Beam me into space!

10:56.233 --> 10:59.199
- Poor guy.
- Yeah.

10:59.200 --> 11:01.632
So, anyway, when we go
back to Game Shakers,

11:01.633 --> 11:03.066
I think that we should...

11:03.067 --> 11:04.399
Ulch, again with the lights?

11:04.400 --> 11:06.566
- C'mon, lights!
- This is ridiculous.

11:06.567 --> 11:08.932
- There we go.

11:08.933 --> 11:11.732
- So anyway,
I was just sayin' that...

11:11.733 --> 11:13.966
Hey hey...

11:13.967 --> 11:15.832
the guy with the accent...

11:15.833 --> 11:17.099
- Where'd he go?!?

11:17.100 --> 11:21.532
- I dunno, I guess...
into space?

11:21.533 --> 11:25.532
- Oh my God!
He was from the future!

11:25.533 --> 11:27.799
- Hey there!

11:27.800 --> 11:30.332
I switched locations!

11:30.333 --> 11:33.067
There was a wee wad a'gum
on m'previous seat!

11:35.433 --> 11:37.313
- Oh hey there's the gum.
- Oh yeah there it is.

11:49.200 --> 11:50.932
- Ewww...
Hudson...

11:50.933 --> 11:53.899
- Hiiii.

11:53.900 --> 11:55.532
- What's that under your nose?

11:55.533 --> 11:58.299
- Small pickle.

11:58.300 --> 12:01.199
I glued it there
to help block the smell.

12:01.200 --> 12:03.633
- Well, what are
you cooking in there?

12:05.233 --> 12:07.500
- Dub's skunky money!

12:11.367 --> 12:13.066
- Oh yeah.

12:13.067 --> 12:14.532
What is this liquid?

12:14.533 --> 12:17.866
- Welp, it's about
60% apple cider vinegar...

12:17.867 --> 12:19.599
20% goat's milk...

12:19.600 --> 12:21.732
and 10% beef juice.

12:21.733 --> 12:23.366
- What is beef juice?

12:23.367 --> 12:25.899
- It happens when
you squeeze beef.

12:25.900 --> 12:27.233
Watch.

12:40.567 --> 12:42.132
- Hey! Hey! Trip!

12:42.133 --> 12:43.699
I got more things to say to you.

12:43.700 --> 12:46.166
- Look, I don't care
what you say anymore!

12:46.167 --> 12:49.166
This is my life.

12:49.167 --> 12:51.832
You're not the boss of me.

12:51.833 --> 12:53.566
- Uh, actually, I am.

12:53.567 --> 12:56.266
- Oh, you're the boss of me?
- Yeah, yeah.

12:56.267 --> 12:58.199
- I'm the boss of everyone.
- No, I don't do that.

12:58.200 --> 12:59.599
That's not accurate.

12:59.600 --> 13:01.699
- Well you won't be my boss
for much longer!

13:01.700 --> 13:04.500
- Oh yeah? Um...

13:05.933 --> 13:09.199
Uh, why don't we finish
this conversation in private?

13:09.200 --> 13:11.600
- Fine with me.

13:13.067 --> 13:14.232
- Wait noooo... I wanna hear...

13:14.233 --> 13:15.432
What are you guys
fighting about?

13:15.433 --> 13:18.099
- It's personal, okay?
- Okay?

13:18.100 --> 13:20.332
- We're gonna have
some words, mister!

13:20.333 --> 13:23.067
- But my curiosity!

13:34.767 --> 13:36.266
- Um, Hudson...

13:36.267 --> 13:37.699
will you c'mere for a minute?

13:37.700 --> 13:39.133
- Sure.

13:41.967 --> 13:44.432
I've arrived.

13:44.433 --> 13:47.332
- Yeah, I think something's
wrong with my trackpad.

13:47.333 --> 13:48.666
Will you try clicking it?

13:48.667 --> 13:51.067
- M'okay.

13:52.667 --> 13:54.866
- Awww Hudson!

13:54.867 --> 13:59.066
You turned on the back
hallway security camera!

13:59.067 --> 14:00.466
- I... I just did what y...

14:00.467 --> 14:03.399
- Just please just go
back to your beef juice.

14:03.400 --> 14:04.599
- Sorry.

14:04.600 --> 14:08.466
- This is my life!
Babe!

14:08.467 --> 14:11.266
- No, you need to be more loyal!
- Oh, really?

14:11.267 --> 14:13.366
Look, I'm just tryin'
to do what's best for me.

14:13.367 --> 14:15.667
- By stabbing me and Kenzie
in the back!

14:18.367 --> 14:19.866
- I'm not stabbing
y'all in the back.

14:19.867 --> 14:21.199
- Well what would you call it?

14:21.200 --> 14:24.166
- I just wanna open
my own game company.

14:24.167 --> 14:27.799
- That's stabbing me
in the back, dude!

14:27.800 --> 14:29.332
- How?!?

14:29.333 --> 14:31.366
- 'Cuz you'd be competing
with Game Shakers!

14:31.367 --> 14:33.099
- Well, if you can't handle
the competition, then...

14:33.100 --> 14:34.432
- Hey!

14:34.433 --> 14:38.133
Don't... mess with me.

14:39.900 --> 14:42.766
- Ooo, is that a threat?

14:42.767 --> 14:45.433
- It's not a Bar Mitzvah
invitation.

14:58.667 --> 15:01.633
- Hey! Hey!
When are they gonna be here?

15:02.767 --> 15:04.733
- Soon! Come on,
get down, get down.

15:19.567 --> 15:22.466
- You can't afford the 10%...

15:22.467 --> 15:23.933
- But if you have the number...

15:26.467 --> 15:28.166
Babe...?

15:28.167 --> 15:30.266
- Oh. Hi. Hey. Hey!

15:30.267 --> 15:34.366
What's up? W-what are
you guys doing here?

15:34.367 --> 15:36.366
- It's nine o'clock.

15:36.367 --> 15:38.632
- And we work here.

15:38.633 --> 15:40.399
- Yeah... uh, yeah, I know.

15:40.400 --> 15:45.099
I uh...
I was just... uh, just kidding.

15:45.100 --> 15:48.099
Ha ha ha ha.

15:48.100 --> 15:50.667
Whuzzzuppp?

15:51.867 --> 15:53.532
- Why were you
mopping the floor?

15:53.533 --> 15:56.099
- Why? Pfftt.
'Cuz I spilled a beverage...

15:56.100 --> 15:57.266
on the floor.

15:57.267 --> 15:58.466
- What beverage?

15:58.467 --> 16:00.066
- I dunno! Okay?

16:00.067 --> 16:01.766
Maybe I don't remember
what beverage... God!

16:01.767 --> 16:03.566
I mean, do you remember
every liquid you've spilled

16:03.567 --> 16:05.966
in your whole life?

16:05.967 --> 16:08.966
- No.
- Okay then.

16:08.967 --> 16:11.699
- Uh, have you been
here all night?

16:11.700 --> 16:13.066
- Pfft. What? No...

16:13.067 --> 16:16.800
All night, nooo,
w-w-why would you ask that?

16:18.067 --> 16:19.232
- Because you're wearing
the same clothes

16:19.233 --> 16:20.233
you had on yesterday.

16:20.234 --> 16:21.499
- So? Look, I left work

16:21.500 --> 16:22.799
last night at 7:30,

16:22.800 --> 16:24.499
and when I left,
Trip was just fine, okay?

16:24.500 --> 16:26.199
Trip was sitting right there
and I haven't seen him since,

16:26.200 --> 16:27.899
but when I saw him last
Trip was totally fine

16:27.900 --> 16:29.632
and I have no idea
what's happened since then.

16:29.633 --> 16:31.066
All right? Okay?

16:31.067 --> 16:32.767
So you guys wanna
get some pancakes?

16:35.433 --> 16:37.432
- Geez Louise.

16:37.433 --> 16:40.632
- You sound like my Aunt Judy
before she takes her pill.

16:40.633 --> 16:43.899
- Okay, if you guys
hate pancakes, fine,

16:43.900 --> 16:46.066
then don't eat any pancakes.
But me?

16:46.067 --> 16:48.132
I'm goin' to get some pancakes.

16:48.133 --> 16:50.066
- Uh, but you still
didn't tell me why

16:50.067 --> 16:54.566
you're wearing the same clothes
you had on yesterday.

16:54.567 --> 16:56.899
- I'm gonna go work
on cleaning Dub's money.

16:56.900 --> 17:00.899
- Well, I'm gonna find out
what happened here last night.

17:00.900 --> 17:02.199
- I thought you promised
Babe you wouldn't look

17:02.200 --> 17:03.899
at the security cameras
to spy on people.

17:03.900 --> 17:06.766
- I'm not gonna look
at the security cameras...

17:06.767 --> 17:10.432
I'm just gonna look
at the video they recorded.

17:10.433 --> 17:12.466
- Ohhh.

17:12.467 --> 17:14.366
Aw man, I'm outta pickles.

17:14.367 --> 17:16.299
Hey Kenz...
- Huh?

17:16.300 --> 17:18.432
- I'm gonna take a walk
and buy some more pickles

17:18.433 --> 17:20.932
to glue under my nose holes.

17:20.933 --> 17:23.133
- Yeah okay,
go get your pickles.

17:25.200 --> 17:27.166
- Okay...

17:27.167 --> 17:29.866
Let's see what
happened here last night.

17:29.867 --> 17:33.066
And, here we go...

17:33.067 --> 17:35.699
- You don't tell me
what I can and can't do!

17:35.700 --> 17:37.499
- Too late,
I'm already doin' it!

17:37.500 --> 17:41.166
- You can't stop me!
- Oh, you don't think so?

17:41.167 --> 17:42.466
- No I do not!

17:42.467 --> 17:44.966
You better just chill
with your attitude.

17:44.967 --> 17:46.800
Yeah, what are you gonna do?

17:48.400 --> 17:49.899
- Arrrgh!

17:49.900 --> 17:52.866
- Hey hey...
- What did I tell you!

17:52.867 --> 17:56.099
- Babe!
- What'd I tell you?!?

17:56.100 --> 17:58.232
- AHHHHHHHH!!!

18:01.867 --> 18:04.367
- Holy butt!!!

18:09.433 --> 18:13.466
Awww Babe, you didn't!

18:13.467 --> 18:15.832
No, no, no,
don't put him in the trunk,

18:15.833 --> 18:17.399
please do not
put him in the tr...

18:17.400 --> 18:21.067
Awww, she's putting
him in the trunk.

18:40.600 --> 18:43.499
Trip?

18:43.500 --> 18:46.499
Trip...?

18:46.500 --> 18:49.067
Are you in there?

18:56.367 --> 18:58.466
T-Trip?

18:58.467 --> 19:01.066
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!

19:01.067 --> 19:03.066
- Now it's your turn!!!

19:03.067 --> 19:06.066
- AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!

19:06.067 --> 19:08.300
- AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!
- AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!

19:12.067 --> 19:14.666
- Well, I bet she won't be
spyin' on us again.

19:14.667 --> 19:16.067
- Nope.

19:18.300 --> 19:19.900
Kenz... Kenz?

19:23.767 --> 19:26.066
- Whoa.

19:26.067 --> 19:28.833
A lot can happen
while you're buying pickles.

19:43.200 --> 19:46.066
- So, you're really taking down
all the security cameras?

19:46.067 --> 19:48.832
- I have to.
They're just too tempting.

19:48.833 --> 19:51.066
- Yeah...

19:51.067 --> 19:54.166
just like my Aunt Judy
with her nuts.

19:54.167 --> 19:55.566
- What?

19:55.567 --> 19:58.532
- My Aunt Judy, she's like
obsessed with peanuts

19:58.533 --> 20:00.066
and cashews and walnuts...

20:00.067 --> 20:01.566
so she never keeps 'em around

20:01.567 --> 20:02.599
'cuz she can't control herself.

20:02.600 --> 20:04.966
- Oh. Yeah.

20:04.967 --> 20:08.267
I guess security cameras
are my nuts.

20:11.667 --> 20:14.399
- DUB DUB DUB DUB
D'DUB DUB DUB,

20:14.400 --> 20:17.399
HERE COMES DOUBLE G.

20:17.400 --> 20:19.900
That's for all
the vintage children.

20:20.933 --> 20:22.866
- Hi, Dub.
- Hey, Dub.

20:22.867 --> 20:25.499
- Hey, Hubbins...
So I got your text sayin'

20:25.500 --> 20:29.066
that all my money's
been de-stankified.

20:29.067 --> 20:32.499
- Oh, yeah.
Here, sniff my cauldron.

20:32.500 --> 20:34.066
- Sniff it?

20:34.067 --> 20:36.466
- Yeah, Hudson cleaned all
your money in that pot.

20:36.467 --> 20:39.399
- Mmmm...

20:39.400 --> 20:40.599
Ah, that smells nice.

20:40.600 --> 20:43.432
You spanked that stank.

20:43.433 --> 20:46.566
- I did! Which makes me...

20:46.567 --> 20:48.966
The stank-spanker.

20:48.967 --> 20:52.166
- Uh, don't do that.

20:52.167 --> 20:53.799
So... is my money
still in there?

20:53.800 --> 20:56.199
- No...
it's over there.

20:56.200 --> 20:57.932
- Oh, over there.
Over where?

20:57.933 --> 20:59.566
W-where's my money?

20:59.567 --> 21:02.067
- Tell 'em.
- That's it.

21:08.367 --> 21:10.499
- What the butt?

21:10.500 --> 21:12.799
- Hudson boiled your money
for so long,

21:12.800 --> 21:14.432
it turned into that.

21:14.433 --> 21:16.066
- Wait a minute.

21:16.067 --> 21:19.066
You're telling me, you turned
my 400 thousand dollars

21:19.067 --> 21:22.799
into this pile
of hot wet slop?!?

21:22.800 --> 21:25.766
- Sniff it.

21:25.767 --> 21:28.499
- I don't wanna sniff it!

21:28.500 --> 21:30.299
- But I got the skunk stank out.

21:30.300 --> 21:32.232
- Yeah. So you owe him
a thousand dollars.

21:32.233 --> 21:33.799
That's what you promised.

21:33.800 --> 21:37.799
- Yeah, that's right.
That's correct!

21:37.800 --> 21:42.300
Uh, lemme see. Umm...

21:46.533 --> 21:48.633
Use some of that
for your education.

21:54.733 --> 21:56.500
- It actually feels comforting.

21:59.067 --> 22:00.633
- Don't do that.

22:01.867 --> 22:04.266
Mmm.
