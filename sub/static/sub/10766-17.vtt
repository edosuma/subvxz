00:02.614 --> 00:04.081
Oh, man.

00:05.083 --> 00:07.074
Y ou know, Monique...

00:07.152 --> 00:09.643
I've never said this to a girl before, but...

00:10.355 --> 00:13.256
Oh, baby, you all that and a bag of chips!

00:14.826 --> 00:16.794
Oh, Will, am I?

00:16.962 --> 00:19.863
Hey, I'm lying, I'm dying,
you know what I'm saying?

00:21.833 --> 00:22.822
Oh, Will.

00:23.435 --> 00:26.598
Hey, babe, I got to tell you,
whatever it is that you serving...

00:26.672 --> 00:28.970
y ou better give me a double!

00:35.013 --> 00:36.480
I was just playing.

00:36.815 --> 00:39.511
Y ou know how I be joking. I be joking.

00:43.488 --> 00:46.013
I wasn't being straight up with you.

00:46.291 --> 00:47.952
But I will now.

00:49.561 --> 00:52.496
Monique, I care about you, baby.

00:53.732 --> 00:55.757
I care about you so much.

00:56.868 --> 00:59.029
I couldn't trust myself...

00:59.137 --> 01:00.934
to express my real feelings.

02:23.989 --> 02:25.616
- Hey.
- Hey, Will.

02:26.291 --> 02:28.088
Man, something smells good.

02:28.660 --> 02:30.218
Oh, wait, that's me.

02:31.396 --> 02:32.420
Hey, y'all, check it out.

02:32.497 --> 02:36.092
I just tried on that new Michael Jackson
cologne down at the mall.

02:36.768 --> 02:38.759
I don't smell anything.

02:39.871 --> 02:43.466
Oh, that's funny. It's a lot lighter
than it was when I put it on.

02:44.376 --> 02:47.436
What are you doing wearing cologne
anyway? Y ou never wear cologne.

02:47.512 --> 02:49.707
He wants to smell good for Monique.

02:49.948 --> 02:52.007
They have a big date tonight.

02:52.217 --> 02:55.675
Y eah. Well, I figured, you know, y'all
gonna be out the house and...

02:55.754 --> 02:58.188
my man, G, here has the night off.

02:58.356 --> 03:01.154
I figure Monique will come over,
we'll go up to my room and...

03:01.226 --> 03:05.720
six or seven hours later, we'll come back
down again, you know what I'm saying?

03:06.098 --> 03:08.157
Y ou don't know what I'm saying.

03:09.234 --> 03:11.259
Well, guys...

03:11.870 --> 03:15.806
what do you think of my new dress?
Doesn't make me look too big, does it?

03:16.575 --> 03:17.667
No?

03:18.510 --> 03:20.603
Hilary, what do you think, honey?

03:21.379 --> 03:24.143
Well, you know how
I'm always borrowing your things?

03:24.216 --> 03:26.776
Well, you don't have to worry
about this one.

03:27.652 --> 03:29.643
- Hi, sweetheart.
- Hello, dear!

03:31.022 --> 03:33.718
- Hi.
- Oh, what a day.

03:33.792 --> 03:35.817
If you guys don't mind it,
I'm going to skip dinner...

03:35.894 --> 03:37.088
and clear up some paperwork.

03:37.162 --> 03:39.323
Philip, remember
we're going to go out to dinner?

03:39.397 --> 03:40.557
Y eah, remember?

03:40.632 --> 03:43.624
Y eah, of course, I remember.
I've been looking forward to it all day.

03:43.702 --> 03:45.294
So, where are we going?

03:45.437 --> 03:48.304
To the restaurant. Le...

03:50.642 --> 03:52.701
Chez...

03:52.778 --> 03:54.871
Mc...

03:56.381 --> 03:58.406
All right, Vivian, I forgot.

03:58.550 --> 04:02.486
I don't believe it. Fine.
We might as well just stay home.

04:03.421 --> 04:04.479
Vivian.

04:04.556 --> 04:07.320
Philip, forget it. I don't want to
go out if you don't want to.

04:07.392 --> 04:09.019
What about what I want?

04:09.795 --> 04:12.161
I mean, what about my needs?

04:13.398 --> 04:15.059
Here you are, madam.

04:16.535 --> 04:18.798
I'm guessing they're not for me.

04:19.204 --> 04:21.262
I haven't put out in years.

04:23.408 --> 04:26.377
Oh, Philip, they're beautiful.

04:26.511 --> 04:27.910
Let me.

04:29.981 --> 04:31.710
"I'm looking forward to dinner tonight...

04:31.783 --> 04:34.684
"with the most beautiful woman
in the world."

04:34.753 --> 04:36.015
I love you.

04:36.087 --> 04:38.555
Oh, Philip, you were teasing me.

04:39.257 --> 04:40.918
- I love you, too.
- Y es.

04:40.992 --> 04:44.450
- Okay, let me just go freshen up.
- Okay, baby. Love you.

04:51.536 --> 04:55.165
Uncle Phil, Trevor sent these flowers.
They're for Hilary.

04:56.107 --> 04:57.369
Not anymore.

05:00.045 --> 05:02.639
Uncle Phil, you lied to your woman.

05:04.049 --> 05:05.812
My man, give it up top.

05:14.926 --> 05:17.360
"Mirror, mirror on the wall..."

05:17.929 --> 05:20.921
Jean-Claude Van... Damn, I'm fine.

05:25.904 --> 05:27.895
Miss Monique is here to see you.

05:28.573 --> 05:30.336
- What's up, baby?
- Hi, honey.

05:30.909 --> 05:35.642
Oh, if you need me, I'll be dodging winos
at the bus station.

05:37.883 --> 05:41.341
Y ou know, my father would kill me
if he knew I was out with a boy tonight.

05:41.419 --> 05:44.286
I told him I was going to church.

05:46.725 --> 05:48.124
The Lord is good.

05:51.663 --> 05:54.359
Why don't you come on over here,
sit down, relax a little bit.

05:54.432 --> 05:55.421
Okay.

06:07.212 --> 06:09.680
Boy, you are pretty slick, Will Smith.

06:09.881 --> 06:12.281
And I ain't even oiled up yet, you know?

06:13.184 --> 06:17.143
I think I should tell you, nothing
turns me on more than a sense of humor.

06:18.023 --> 06:19.547
Really?

06:19.658 --> 06:22.923
Maybe you'd like to go upstairs
and I could do my stand-up.

06:24.496 --> 06:27.158
Now, why waste time going upstairs?

06:27.365 --> 06:31.324
See, this way whenever you pass
the couch, you'll think of me.

06:37.676 --> 06:41.737
Maybe I could get some memories of you
in the kitchen and the Jacuzzi, too.

06:42.580 --> 06:44.480
Watch yourself, girl.

06:52.190 --> 06:54.090
Mama knows, child.

07:13.845 --> 07:15.574
Baby, what you doing?

07:17.949 --> 07:20.349
Will, I can't do this.

07:20.485 --> 07:21.577
I better go.

07:22.087 --> 07:24.021
Baby, what's the problem?

07:24.089 --> 07:26.148
Y ou really turn me on.

07:26.324 --> 07:27.951
What's the problem?

07:32.163 --> 07:35.564
I don't know, Will. I really thought that
I could handle all this...

07:35.633 --> 07:38.534
but I can't, so we better stop.

07:38.603 --> 07:41.504
Baby, some things
just ain't that easy to stop.

07:41.573 --> 07:44.667
I know, and it isn't that easy
for me either...

07:44.743 --> 07:47.007
but, Will, I want you.

07:47.379 --> 07:50.746
But I guess deep down inside
I'm just an old-fashioned girl.

07:50.815 --> 07:54.410
I want to be married
before I go all the way.

07:55.487 --> 07:57.216
Y ou understand, don't you?

07:58.189 --> 08:01.989
Look, Monique, I'd love to talk,
but there ain't no blood in my brain.

08:12.370 --> 08:15.897
Will. It's only 7:00. What are you doing up?

08:16.307 --> 08:18.002
Look here, I've been up for hours, man.

08:18.076 --> 08:20.374
I swam like 20 laps in the pool...

08:21.079 --> 08:24.879
went down shot some hoops, jogged
around the track a half dozen times.

08:24.949 --> 08:26.883
I waxed your car for you, too.

08:27.018 --> 08:29.009
No nookie last night?

08:31.222 --> 08:34.020
Man, no nookie, no nothing, man.

08:34.092 --> 08:35.525
Look, see, I don't understand, man.

08:35.592 --> 08:37.754
She was here,
everything was lovely and perfect...

08:37.828 --> 08:41.094
then all of a sudden, she wasn't with it
no more. I don't get it.

08:42.033 --> 08:44.661
Will, you just don't understand women.

08:44.736 --> 08:47.261
When it comes to matters of the heart,
you can't rush things.

08:47.338 --> 08:49.533
Give a girl time, she'll come around.

08:49.607 --> 08:52.474
Really? How long do you usually
give them?

08:53.311 --> 08:57.475
Let's see, a week from Friday,
it will be 18 years.

08:59.451 --> 09:02.352
- Morning, boys.
- Hey, good morning, Uncle Phil.

09:03.655 --> 09:05.919
- Good morning, Dad.
- Good morning, son.

09:08.760 --> 09:10.853
Hey, look, Uncle Phil, check it out.

09:10.929 --> 09:12.920
Can I talk to you for a second?

09:14.699 --> 09:15.996
Do you have to?

09:16.668 --> 09:18.693
Come on, Uncle Phil, this is serious, man.

09:18.770 --> 09:21.000
I need to talk to you about...

09:21.873 --> 09:23.807
- cars.
- Cars, you...

09:26.411 --> 09:28.345
Oh, cars!

09:30.915 --> 09:34.351
Y eah, well, I guess it is about time...

09:34.686 --> 09:36.517
that you and I started talking about...

09:37.388 --> 09:38.377
- cars.
- Cars.

09:43.128 --> 09:46.461
Oh, God, this car isn't in trouble, is it?

09:46.664 --> 09:47.858
Oh, no.

09:48.633 --> 09:51.193
Never been off the lot as far as I can tell.

09:57.575 --> 10:00.373
Look, Will, driving is serious business.

10:01.312 --> 10:05.339
Well, these days you got to think
about safety.

10:05.717 --> 10:09.676
Y ou never want to go for a ride in a car
without your seat belt.

10:15.493 --> 10:18.485
And use your brakes.

10:18.997 --> 10:21.295
Don't floor it because...

10:21.666 --> 10:24.897
then you throw a rod, you flood
your carburetor, you crack your block.

10:25.036 --> 10:27.027
Y ou understand what I'm saying?

10:28.606 --> 10:29.868
No, man.

10:31.543 --> 10:33.568
No sex before marriage.

10:35.013 --> 10:38.073
- Come on, Uncle Phil, this is the '90s, man.
- Take a cold shower.

10:38.149 --> 10:41.482
I've been doing that since the '80s.
It don't work no more.

10:41.553 --> 10:45.045
Look, Will, I know I'm talking to
teenage hormones from hell...

10:45.123 --> 10:48.183
but if you care about this young lady,
you don't want to do anything...

10:48.259 --> 10:50.056
to damage the relationship.

10:50.328 --> 10:53.229
And intimacy requires a real commitment.

10:56.034 --> 10:58.366
Uncle Phil, I'm saying, Uncle Phil.

10:58.570 --> 11:01.903
We both mens here, you know?
We got ugly needs.

11:03.875 --> 11:06.844
Will, you're a grown man.
I can't watch you all the time.

11:06.911 --> 11:10.210
I'm just going to have to rely on you
to do the right thing.

11:10.949 --> 11:13.975
Dearly beloved, we are gathered here...

11:14.219 --> 11:17.382
to unite this couple in holy matrimony.

11:24.896 --> 11:27.387
And by the powers invested into me...

11:27.765 --> 11:30.256
and for the republic in which it stands...

11:31.135 --> 11:33.603
I now pronounce you man and wife.

11:34.405 --> 11:35.394
Get busy.

11:40.712 --> 11:44.011
Will, I'm so happy.
I can't believe we did this.

11:44.082 --> 11:46.676
Me, neither. Come on, let's go, baby.

11:49.020 --> 11:52.217
Father, Father. Chill, all right?

11:52.957 --> 11:54.015
Look, baby, I'm...

11:54.092 --> 11:55.855
I need to take care of the Reverend,
all right?

11:55.927 --> 11:58.452
Okay, honey, I'm going to
go warm up the car.

12:00.498 --> 12:03.058
Hey. This is God's crib.

12:03.134 --> 12:05.967
Take that in the street where it belongs.

12:13.945 --> 12:15.344
We better get out of here, my brother.

12:15.413 --> 12:18.814
Any minute now that minister's going
to realize his house ain't on fire.

12:18.883 --> 12:22.819
I don't believe this, Jazz, man,
together we are invincible.

12:23.755 --> 12:27.714
Granted, my brother, we're good,
but people can still see us.

12:39.604 --> 12:41.037
Baby, here we go.

12:41.105 --> 12:42.595
Over the threshold.

12:42.707 --> 12:44.766
Oh, look at this, a chair...

12:44.876 --> 12:46.343
a nice drawer.

12:46.411 --> 12:48.641
Oh, but look what's over here, a bed.

12:52.750 --> 12:55.275
Honey, wait. Slow it down.

12:55.453 --> 12:57.182
This is our wedding night.

12:57.255 --> 12:59.314
I know, I know, but...

12:59.390 --> 13:02.120
we only got 18 hours left before checkout.

13:03.261 --> 13:05.821
These damn buttons.
Y ou got some scissors, girl?

13:05.897 --> 13:09.162
Will, please, now, come on.
Just give me a minute, okay?

13:09.233 --> 13:11.861
I want to put something special on
for you.

13:12.070 --> 13:15.130
And I promise it'll be worth the wait.

13:15.673 --> 13:16.662
Trust me.

13:26.651 --> 13:27.640
Hey.

13:49.107 --> 13:50.438
I'm ready.

14:07.325 --> 14:08.883
Do you like it?

14:09.761 --> 14:10.819
Wow!

14:13.431 --> 14:14.762
I love it.

14:15.166 --> 14:17.794
- All right, now, take it off.
- Oh, honey.

14:18.636 --> 14:20.399
Will, we're married.

14:20.705 --> 14:22.297
I am so happy...

14:23.274 --> 14:25.902
and I'm going to make you happy, too.

14:26.010 --> 14:27.375
Okey doke.

14:30.481 --> 14:32.073
Girl, be gentle.

14:33.251 --> 14:36.049
Honey, I meant for the rest of our lives.

14:38.055 --> 14:40.319
I'm going to be a good wife, Will...

14:40.391 --> 14:43.952
because I believe
in the sanctity of marriage. Don't you?

14:44.862 --> 14:47.456
Y eah, come on, baby, let's get naked.

14:47.698 --> 14:49.325
This thing open
from the back or the front?

14:49.400 --> 14:50.765
Oh, Will.

14:51.269 --> 14:53.999
There's something I want to give to you.

14:55.606 --> 14:59.736
What a coincidence 'cause
there's something I want to give you, too.

15:01.012 --> 15:02.104
This.

15:03.848 --> 15:07.807
It belonged to my great grandfather.
Now I want you to have it.

15:08.186 --> 15:12.020
- Thanks, a little box.
- Y ou didn't even open it, silly.

15:13.591 --> 15:14.683
Here.

15:15.593 --> 15:18.391
My great grandmother gave it
to him on their wedding night.

15:18.463 --> 15:22.126
And Grandma gave it to Grampy
and Mama gave it to Daddy...

15:22.767 --> 15:24.997
and now I'm giving it to you.

15:30.174 --> 15:34.167
My parents are going to kill me when
they find out what we've done, but...

15:37.281 --> 15:38.771
But I don't care.

15:39.217 --> 15:41.981
Will, I'm proud that
you're part of my family now...

15:42.053 --> 15:44.453
because you're decent and honest.

15:47.024 --> 15:48.514
Baby, I trust you.

15:48.593 --> 15:53.360
And I know you will love me and
cherish me as long as we both shall live.

16:03.741 --> 16:05.208
Now, take me.

16:13.618 --> 16:15.313
Oh, damn!

16:20.491 --> 16:23.221
All right, all right, look, check it out.

16:23.661 --> 16:25.026
Look here.

16:25.296 --> 16:27.321
I'll be right back, baby.

16:27.498 --> 16:30.490
- Where are you going?
- I mean, look...

16:30.601 --> 16:34.162
you gave me Grampy's watch and
everything, and I ain't got nothing for you.

16:34.238 --> 16:36.502
So I got to go get you something.

16:36.574 --> 16:38.098
Sorry, Grampy.

16:43.281 --> 16:46.512
Y ou know, my child, I've never known
the pleasures of the flesh...

16:46.584 --> 16:50.418
but I could be convinced to give up
the priesthood for you.

16:53.190 --> 16:55.988
Y ou know, my child, I've never known
the pleasures of the flesh...

16:56.060 --> 16:57.391
but I could be convinced to give up...

16:57.461 --> 17:00.191
<i>E</i> xcuse me, Father,
could I rap to you for a second.

17:00.264 --> 17:04.223
Don't go away baby. Bartender,
another Olde <i>E</i> nglish for the lady.

17:09.073 --> 17:11.633
It's a fashion risk, but I like it.

17:12.009 --> 17:13.374
Jazz, sit down.

17:13.477 --> 17:17.071
Look, I can't believe I let you
talk me into this, man. I feel awful.

17:17.147 --> 17:20.083
Will, a naked, willing female
is in your room.

17:20.351 --> 17:22.819
Stop me when I get to the awful part.

17:22.887 --> 17:25.913
I don't have a right to treat her like this,
man. She's a human being.

17:25.990 --> 17:27.457
Well, that's enough.

17:27.525 --> 17:29.493
Now, get a bottle of whiskey,
liquor that girl up...

17:29.560 --> 17:32.859
and take advantage of her.
Be a man for God's sake.

17:34.332 --> 17:38.132
Jazz, I'm sorry, man, I can't.
I've got to tell her the truth.

17:38.369 --> 17:40.064
Maybe you're right.

17:40.137 --> 17:43.197
Perhaps we've both been a little remiss
in our treatment of women.

17:43.274 --> 17:44.707
Y ou think?

17:44.909 --> 17:47.139
Y eah. Y ou inspire me, Prince.

17:47.378 --> 17:48.504
From now on...

17:48.579 --> 17:52.242
I, too, will be completely honest
in my dealings with the fair sex.

17:52.316 --> 17:53.510
My man.

17:56.354 --> 17:59.380
Y ou know, my child, I've never known
the pleasures of the flesh...

17:59.457 --> 18:03.223
but I could be convinced
to give up the priesthood for you.

18:06.097 --> 18:07.997
Honey, where have you...

18:10.067 --> 18:12.126
Monique, this is going to be
hard enough as it is...

18:12.203 --> 18:14.797
so please just let me do the talking.

18:19.710 --> 18:23.612
I know you respect honesty in a man,
so I'm going to be honest.

18:25.683 --> 18:28.311
Monique, I just wanted
to get you into bed...

18:28.386 --> 18:30.047
so I tricked you.

18:30.388 --> 18:32.652
The whole ceremony was a fake...

18:32.723 --> 18:34.918
and we're not really married.

18:36.694 --> 18:38.787
Monique, look, I'm sorry...

18:39.764 --> 18:43.097
and I know what I did was wrong.
And, Monique, I really care about you.

18:46.237 --> 18:47.568
I'm sorry.

18:56.414 --> 18:57.779
Monique...

18:58.449 --> 19:01.350
the room is paid for and everything,
so why don't, you know...

19:01.419 --> 19:03.944
I was just hoping that maybe since...

19:10.227 --> 19:13.060
So, could you just come get me,
Uncle Phil?

19:15.700 --> 19:17.190
Y our Mercedes?

19:17.535 --> 19:19.696
Oh, well, yeah. No.

19:20.071 --> 19:22.904
See, actually, yeah. I did borrow it.

19:23.808 --> 19:27.266
Well, but, you know,
it's not here right now.

19:29.380 --> 19:31.905
Well, to be honest, my wife took it.

19:46.263 --> 19:50.324
All I could overhear were the words
Mercedes, wife, and Monique...

19:50.401 --> 19:52.562
and then Dad ran out of the house.

19:52.636 --> 19:54.604
Well, I think it's obvious what happened.

19:54.672 --> 19:58.574
Will and Monique stole a Mercedes,
and ran over somebody's wife.

19:59.343 --> 20:01.208
Carlton, that's ridiculous.

20:01.278 --> 20:05.942
Obviously, Will has been seeing a woman
named Mercedes, Monique found out...

20:06.050 --> 20:08.610
and I'm still working on the wife part.

20:08.686 --> 20:11.917
Well, I think Will married Monique
just to get her into bed...

20:11.989 --> 20:16.255
and when she found out, she got so mad
she took off in Dad's Mercedes.

20:17.628 --> 20:18.856
Get real!

20:20.865 --> 20:23.629
I still can't believe that you could do
something so despicable.

20:23.701 --> 20:25.794
I mean, marrying Monique
just to get her in bed?

20:25.870 --> 20:27.861
<i>E</i> ven I don't believe it.

20:33.511 --> 20:36.241
I can't imagine what kind of excuse
you could come up with.

20:36.313 --> 20:39.407
Do you have anything to say
in your own defense?

20:39.517 --> 20:40.745
Nothing.

20:41.018 --> 20:43.748
It's shameful, Uncle Phil.
I mean, here you are...

20:43.821 --> 20:46.255
busting your hump
trying to impart values...

20:46.323 --> 20:47.813
and teach basic human decency...

20:47.892 --> 20:50.417
and I turn around
and do some mess like this.

20:52.329 --> 20:54.354
I just don't get it, Will.

20:54.698 --> 20:55.960
I mean...

20:56.433 --> 20:59.129
what is going on in that head of yours?

20:59.770 --> 21:01.294
I don't know, Uncle Phil.

21:01.372 --> 21:05.035
I'm out of control.
Please stop me before I disobey again.

21:07.111 --> 21:09.272
Don't you ever stop to think...

21:09.346 --> 21:12.144
before you do these disgusting things?

21:12.416 --> 21:16.113
Of course, I do, Uncle Phil.
Do you think I like being the way I am?

21:16.187 --> 21:17.518
I'm a victim.

21:17.588 --> 21:19.954
I'm a victim of my imagination.

21:21.992 --> 21:23.254
Help me.

21:29.400 --> 21:30.697
Well...

21:31.535 --> 21:34.060
all right, since you put it that way.

21:35.873 --> 21:38.307
I'm not going to punish you, Will.

21:40.177 --> 21:43.772
Y ou know, that's radical, Uncle Phil,
but it just might work.

21:43.848 --> 21:46.146
I'm not going to punish you today...

21:46.217 --> 21:47.946
maybe not even tomorrow.

21:48.018 --> 21:50.578
Y ou see, I need to think a long, long time...

21:50.654 --> 21:53.020
about just what I'm going to do with you.

21:53.090 --> 21:56.890
I don't know, it might
come to me in the middle of the night...

21:56.961 --> 22:00.124
or maybe next week,
or a few years from now.

22:01.065 --> 22:04.057
In the meantime,
why don't you worry about it?

22:06.337 --> 22:07.964
Be afraid, Will.

22:10.875 --> 22:12.399
Be very afraid.

22:35.799 --> 22:37.232
I've got it.

22:37.801 --> 22:38.995
Will!

22:48.078 --> 22:50.911
I want to put something special on
for you.

22:51.015 --> 22:53.142
And I promise it'll be worth the wait.

22:53.217 --> 22:54.343
Trust me.

23:08.966 --> 23:11.059
