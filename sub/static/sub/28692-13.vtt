00:02.002 --> 00:04.372
Gordon: Previously on
"MasterChef"...

00:04.405 --> 00:06.340
Welcome Chef Morimoto.

00:06.374 --> 00:08.409
- Oh, my God!
- Oh!

00:10.010 --> 00:11.545
Wow.

00:11.579 --> 00:14.048
Only three home cooks
gained immunity...

00:14.082 --> 00:15.883
Micah, Shari, Fred.

00:15.916 --> 00:18.018
...securing their spot
on the balcony.

00:18.052 --> 00:20.354
I think, one of your
best dishes ever.

00:20.388 --> 00:22.823
- Thank you.

00:22.856 --> 00:24.558
- Tonight...
- It's season ten.

00:24.592 --> 00:26.560
It's time for all of you
to rise to the challenge.

00:26.594 --> 00:29.063
- ...it's a mystery box...
- Oh!

00:29.097 --> 00:31.532
- Uh-huh.
- ...that's anything but stale.

00:31.565 --> 00:33.367
Aarón:
Not only do you have to
make us an amazing dish,

00:33.401 --> 00:35.035
you have to make us two.

00:35.069 --> 00:36.904
And with elimination
on the line...

00:36.937 --> 00:38.406
- Oh, my God.

00:38.439 --> 00:39.773
- This isn't good.

00:39.807 --> 00:41.375
...one home cook
will be sliced

00:41.409 --> 00:43.277
- from the competition.
- Joe: Nick!

00:43.311 --> 00:46.214
I think this is the first time
he's felt a lot of pressure.

00:46.247 --> 00:48.416
O-M-G.

00:48.449 --> 00:52.253
- It's terrible!
- I'm amazed you've
come out this bad.

00:52.286 --> 00:54.188
- Thank you for your feedback.
- Could you imagine

00:54.222 --> 00:56.890
if your MasterChef dream
ends on meatloaf?

00:56.924 --> 00:59.227
That should come
with a hazard warning sign.

01:10.738 --> 01:13.941
- Welcome back. Let's go!
- Let's get this thing going.

01:13.974 --> 01:17.611
Ladies and gentlemen,
line up, please.

01:17.645 --> 01:19.980
- Well, hello.
- Hello, hello, hello.

01:20.013 --> 01:22.650
Okay.

01:22.683 --> 01:24.952
- Mystery boxes. Great.
- Yep.

01:24.985 --> 01:27.087
Subha: I am excited.
I'm in top 13.

01:27.121 --> 01:28.722
I've come so far.

01:28.756 --> 01:30.458
I've been in so many
elimination challenges

01:30.491 --> 01:32.960
and I have battle wounds
to show.

01:32.993 --> 01:35.329
I miss my wife and kids.

01:35.363 --> 01:37.631
This is the longest
I have been without them,

01:37.665 --> 01:40.734
but I'm here to stay on
and win this thing.

01:40.768 --> 01:44.071
Micah, Shari, and Fred,
you three are in the top 12,

01:44.104 --> 01:45.806
so congratulations.

01:45.839 --> 01:48.476
- Good job. Amazing.
- Both: Thank you, Chef.

01:49.710 --> 01:51.145
For the rest of you,

01:51.179 --> 01:53.481
sadly, tonight somebody
will be going home.

01:53.514 --> 01:57.818
Now, it's time for all of you
to rise to the challenge.

01:57.851 --> 02:02.122
Dorian, elimination and you
is like tomato and basil.

02:02.156 --> 02:03.357
What's going on?

02:03.391 --> 02:04.658
I was so close yesterday.

02:04.692 --> 02:07.161
But every time I cook,
I learn.

02:07.195 --> 02:09.463
And I continue
to challenge myself,

02:09.497 --> 02:11.365
- so I can't be upset about it.
- Yeah.

02:11.399 --> 02:13.501
Nick, tonight's your first
elimination challenge.

02:13.534 --> 02:15.669
- How's that feel?
- I mean, it's humbling
to be down here.

02:15.703 --> 02:17.938
And failing can definitely be
the best way to learn,

02:17.971 --> 02:19.307
so I'm gonna embrace it.

02:19.340 --> 02:21.209
I'm not going to get
to the finals

02:21.242 --> 02:24.445
if I don't fail
throughout this process,

02:24.478 --> 02:26.214
and I'm going to embrace it
in every way.

02:26.247 --> 02:27.881
And if I don't do that,
then what's the point

02:27.915 --> 02:30.351
of taking time off
of school and being here?

02:30.384 --> 02:34.888
It is time to face your
next elimination challenge.

02:34.922 --> 02:36.890
Please, put on
those black aprons

02:36.924 --> 02:40.060
and head to your stations.

02:40.093 --> 02:43.231
I just haven't
had the history of success

02:43.264 --> 02:45.032
in the elimination challenges.

02:45.065 --> 02:46.667
So I just need
to block out the noise

02:46.700 --> 02:49.036
and just try
to cook great food.

02:49.069 --> 02:52.240
It's time for
our next mystery box,

02:52.273 --> 02:54.275
and it's our biggest one yet.

02:56.677 --> 02:59.380
Bri: In the last
two mystery boxes

02:59.413 --> 03:01.849
I've had one
of the best dishes.

03:01.882 --> 03:04.184
So, I am feeling good
about this challenge.

03:04.218 --> 03:06.887
I don't need to stress the fact
that it's season ten

03:06.920 --> 03:09.590
and we've been living large.

03:09.623 --> 03:12.393
And that's all been small-time

03:12.426 --> 03:14.995
compared to what you're
gonna face under those boxes.

03:15.028 --> 03:16.830
You've already cooked
with lobster,

03:16.864 --> 03:20.601
Alaskan king crab,
Tomahawk steaks,

03:20.634 --> 03:22.270
but today is the day

03:22.303 --> 03:24.572
that we will top it all.

03:25.573 --> 03:27.441
Right, you ready?

03:27.475 --> 03:31.044
On the count of three,
very carefully lift your boxes.

03:31.078 --> 03:36.950
One, two, three, lift.

03:37.985 --> 03:39.720
- Oh!
- Oh.

03:39.753 --> 03:40.954
- All right.
- Uh-huh.

03:40.988 --> 03:43.591
- Sourdough bread.
- All right.

03:43.624 --> 03:46.894
That's right,
a single loaf of bread.

03:48.962 --> 03:51.399
- Mmm.
- Listen closely.

03:51.432 --> 03:53.701
Not only do you have to make us
an amazing bread dish,

03:53.734 --> 03:57.971
you have to make us
two amazing bread dishes.

03:58.005 --> 04:00.708
We want one entrée
and one dessert,

04:00.741 --> 04:05.279
and you'll have just one hour
to make them both.

04:05.313 --> 04:06.614
Dorian: Two dishes.

04:06.647 --> 04:08.316
I knew it was gonna be a twist,

04:08.349 --> 04:09.717
but this is my opportunity

04:09.750 --> 04:12.085
to change my family's life,

04:12.119 --> 04:14.422
so I'm gonna
fight my way through it
like I always have.

04:14.455 --> 04:18.926
You'll have complete access
to the MasterChef pantry,

04:18.959 --> 04:21.429
and there you'll find
an incredible array of breads.

04:21.462 --> 04:22.763
In addition to those loaves,

04:22.796 --> 04:23.764
lots of other
beautiful ingredients

04:23.797 --> 04:25.065
that will help you create

04:25.098 --> 04:28.402
two elegant and creative
bread dishes.

04:28.436 --> 04:30.103
A sandwich
is not gonna cut it.

04:30.137 --> 04:32.105
And if you just
serve us toast,

04:32.139 --> 04:34.342
let's face it,
you'll be toast.

04:35.509 --> 04:38.145
Your 60 minutes starts now.

04:38.178 --> 04:39.913
- Let's go.
- Let's go, guys.

04:39.947 --> 04:41.749
- Hustle, hustle, hustle.
- You guys got this.

04:41.782 --> 04:42.850
- You got it, Wu.
- You got this.

04:44.818 --> 04:47.821
- Sourdough.
- Sugar, sugar, sugar.

04:47.855 --> 04:49.923
Sugar. Rice, flour.
Where's the sugar?

04:49.957 --> 04:53.994
Ginger, garlic, fennel.
Fennel we'll do for the dessert?

04:54.027 --> 04:56.330
Renee: I'm confident going
into this challenge today.

04:56.364 --> 04:59.500
I love bread.
Hello, look at me.

04:59.533 --> 05:03.270
The last challenge,
I tried to be way too fancy.

05:03.303 --> 05:05.272
Has anyone seen
the balsamic?

05:05.305 --> 05:09.443
So, in today's challenge,
I'm gonna do comfort food.

05:09.477 --> 05:11.845
It will kind of hit the soul
of the judges.

05:11.879 --> 05:15.148
Let's go, Renee.
Come on, Renee.

05:15.182 --> 05:17.317
Gordon:
Let's go, guys.

05:17.351 --> 05:18.852
Aarón:
Let's go, Jamie, come on.

05:22.189 --> 05:24.692
I'm doing a stuffed
chicken wing

05:24.725 --> 05:26.994
with a picatta sauce
with homemade breadcrumbs.

05:27.027 --> 05:30.230
The other dish is I'm gonna do
a bourbon cherry bread pudding

05:30.263 --> 05:31.965
with a sauvignon sauce.

05:31.999 --> 05:33.701
Shari: Noah,
you're a great chopper.

05:33.734 --> 05:35.369
Noah: Thank you.

05:39.507 --> 05:41.141
Let's go, Wu.

05:41.174 --> 05:42.676
For once, I don't have
to do a protein.

05:42.710 --> 05:44.712
So I'm going to make
a creamy tomato soup

05:44.745 --> 05:48.382
in the sourdough bun
with a banana tarte tatin.

05:48.416 --> 05:50.451
I'm putting it all on the line
because I don't wanna
go home today.

05:55.556 --> 05:58.358
Oh, Jamie's got
the mortar and pestle out.

05:58.392 --> 06:00.093
Go with what brought you here
is what they say,

06:00.127 --> 06:01.562
so that's what I'm doing.

06:01.595 --> 06:03.230
I'm gonna go back
to a filet red snapper.

06:03.263 --> 06:05.666
I'm gonna encrust that
with some--

06:05.699 --> 06:07.901
some pecans
and some breadcrumbs.

06:07.935 --> 06:10.438
I got bread in the oven
toasting right now.

06:10.471 --> 06:12.840
Then I'm gonna do my take
on a Bananas Foster

06:12.873 --> 06:15.609
on a sourdough
French toast ring.
It should be good.

06:15.643 --> 06:17.377
Now, this challenge
is way tougher than you think.

06:17.411 --> 06:19.747
How do you repurpose bread
in a creative way

06:19.780 --> 06:21.615
that equals flavor
in an elevated dish?

06:21.649 --> 06:23.250
I would take
some of that stale bread

06:23.283 --> 06:25.052
and make the most
amazing breadcrumbs

06:25.085 --> 06:26.454
with fresh basil.

06:26.487 --> 06:27.921
Dessert-wise, I'd have to go

06:27.955 --> 06:29.723
for that bread
and butter pudding.

06:29.757 --> 06:31.191
Joe: And then you can go to
the more sophisticated things

06:31.224 --> 06:32.593
like making a bread gnocchi,

06:32.626 --> 06:35.896
and you can encrust
a fish with bread.

06:35.929 --> 06:37.798
There's so many things
to do with bread.

06:37.831 --> 06:40.400
This is a true test
for a MasterChef.

06:40.434 --> 06:42.402
Guys, ten minutes gone,
50 minutes to go.

06:42.436 --> 06:45.739
Let's go.

06:45.773 --> 06:48.642
Look at Nick already.
It's starting to smoke.
He's smoking something.

06:48.676 --> 06:50.944
Nick:
Despite this being my first
elimination challenge,

06:50.978 --> 06:53.747
I don't wanna go into
the kitchen and play it safe
and fall in the middle.

06:53.781 --> 06:55.583
The easy option
to do with this bread

06:55.616 --> 06:57.985
would be to make a soup,
put it in a bread bowl,

06:58.018 --> 07:00.954
and then make a dessert
with a bread pudding or,

07:00.988 --> 07:02.456
you know,
something simple like that.

07:04.492 --> 07:06.560
- How's it taste, Nick?
- My favorite food.

07:06.594 --> 07:09.329
- What is it? You're a bold man.
- Uni.

07:09.362 --> 07:11.098
That's not a bold choice.
That's a brilliant choice.

07:11.131 --> 07:13.901
To win "MasterChef" season ten,
without a question,

07:13.934 --> 07:17.004
you have to be pushing every
boundary whenever possible.

07:17.037 --> 07:19.507
- Right, Nick,
I saw the smoking gun.
- Yes, Chef.

07:19.540 --> 07:21.241
- Yes, Chef.
- Give us an insight.
What are you doing?

07:21.274 --> 07:22.810
I'm doing a uni gnocchi.

07:22.843 --> 07:24.778
I'm using the bread
to make the dough.

07:24.812 --> 07:26.313
So I have an uni butter
right there

07:26.346 --> 07:27.347
and then this is gonna be
a smoked egg yolk.

07:27.380 --> 07:29.182
Smoked egg yolks.

07:29.216 --> 07:31.519
You're only 22 years of age
and you've got this inspiration.

07:31.552 --> 07:33.921
Knowing how
confidently you cook,

07:33.954 --> 07:35.923
why didn't you
get a chance earlier

07:35.956 --> 07:38.125
to pursue a career
in food?

07:38.158 --> 07:39.760
You know, I think I had a lot
of pressure from my family

07:39.793 --> 07:42.996
to go after
the stereotypical college,
you know--

07:43.030 --> 07:45.132
- Sure.
- But once I got to college,

07:45.165 --> 07:47.835
they trusted me to follow
my passions and do it well,

07:47.868 --> 07:49.670
and so I'm here
giving it my all.

07:49.703 --> 07:52.339
- Don't stop.
- Any tips for
the gnocchi dough?

07:52.372 --> 07:54.542
- 'Cause I've never
made gnocchi before.
- Yeah, so,

07:54.575 --> 07:57.344
- it's about that pillow.
Fluffing that pillow up.
- Okay. Okay.

07:57.377 --> 07:59.279
- Okay.
- But not too starchy,
not too gummy.

07:59.312 --> 08:01.181
- Good luck.
Good luck. Good luck.
- Thank you very much.

08:04.417 --> 08:07.120
All right, Miss Renee,
I see you got some
beautiful ground meat.

08:07.154 --> 08:09.322
- What are you making?
- I'm making a childhood
favorite of mine.

08:09.356 --> 08:11.559
I'm doing meatloaf,
rosemary, roasted potatoes,

08:11.592 --> 08:14.061
sautéed green beans,
and a strawberry
shortcake trifle.

08:14.094 --> 08:17.364
Meatloaf is a southern staple
and it's not anything fancy.

08:17.397 --> 08:19.299
It's just nostalgia.

08:19.332 --> 08:22.302
My granny always
made meatloaf,

08:22.335 --> 08:24.237
and I decided just
to do a good sourdough

08:24.271 --> 08:26.006
and soak it in milk for a while

08:26.039 --> 08:27.675
while I sauté
just simple vegetables.

08:27.708 --> 08:31.144
Renee, just make sure that
you elevate your meatloaf.

08:31.178 --> 08:33.046
- Oh, yes.
- Aarón: Let's go.

08:34.782 --> 08:36.684
Mmm. That's so good.

08:37.951 --> 08:39.587
Oh, lovely,
lovely, lovely.

08:39.620 --> 08:42.590
Come on. Jeez.

08:42.623 --> 08:43.991
I'm a little behind here,

08:44.024 --> 08:45.693
and I'm starting to get nervous

08:45.726 --> 08:47.995
because I really didn't think

08:48.028 --> 08:49.062
I'd struggle this much
with this challenge.

08:49.096 --> 08:51.064
You need to get that going.

08:51.098 --> 08:53.100
I don't want him to go home
'cause he didn't finish it.

08:53.133 --> 08:54.735
This dish has a lot
of components,

08:54.768 --> 08:57.070
and I've only worked on
making the uni butter.

08:57.104 --> 08:58.572
You know, this--
this isn't good.

08:58.606 --> 09:01.408
- If I don't catch up,

09:01.441 --> 09:03.543
I'm not going to get
everything on the plate.

09:03.577 --> 09:04.745
- Gordon: Guess what.
- What?

09:04.778 --> 09:06.780
Nick, he's doing
a bread gnocchi.

09:06.814 --> 09:09.549
- Oh, fantastic. Classic.
- Potentially a lot
can go wrong.

09:09.583 --> 09:12.085
- I'm worried about
Nick's technique.
- Joe: Me, too.

09:12.119 --> 09:14.922
The perfect gnocchi would be
just bread and potatoes.

09:14.955 --> 09:18.726
Nick, the more flour
you put into your gnocchi,
the harder they will be.

09:18.759 --> 09:21.228
- Okay.
- I think this is
the first time

09:21.261 --> 09:23.296
he's felt a lot
of pressure, actually.

09:23.330 --> 09:25.398
He's pushing himself.

09:25.432 --> 09:28.568
Nick. Nick.

09:28.602 --> 09:30.037
I'm just trying to move
as fast as I can.

09:30.070 --> 09:32.806
I'm taking on a heck
of a lot right now,

09:32.840 --> 09:35.809
so I'm trying to--
I'm just trying to go.

09:35.843 --> 09:37.310
Fred:
Oh, no, Nick.

09:37.344 --> 09:39.512
I really hope that
that doesn't send him home.

09:48.588 --> 09:51.491
Just under 40 minutes to go.
Come on, guys, multitask.

09:51.524 --> 09:54.795
I forgot the damn cinnamon.

09:54.828 --> 09:56.229
Whoo!

09:56.263 --> 09:58.131
Sarah:
I'm really homesick,

09:58.165 --> 10:00.333
so I'm making a dish
that I love to get

10:00.367 --> 10:02.970
when I'm on a date
with my husband Michael.

10:03.003 --> 10:04.672
Sarah, how we doing here?

10:04.705 --> 10:06.273
All right, Chef, I think.

10:06.306 --> 10:08.308
I've never made
gnocchi before, so--

10:08.341 --> 10:10.577
- You're doing gnocchi and fish?
- I am, Yes.

10:10.610 --> 10:12.680
Are you're gonna
have a bread component
to the fish as well?

10:12.713 --> 10:14.447
Time permitting,
yes, Chef.

10:14.481 --> 10:15.916
- Try to keep
the size consistent.
- Yes, Chef.

10:15.949 --> 10:17.951
Thank you, Chef.

10:17.985 --> 10:19.486
Subha's busting out
the pressure cooker.

10:19.519 --> 10:21.655
- Oh, yeah, Subha!
- That's awesome.

10:21.689 --> 10:23.991
- Thank you.
- Right, Subha.

10:24.024 --> 10:25.926
- So you're pressure cooking
the chicken.
- Yes.

10:25.959 --> 10:27.494
- Where does the bread come in?
- I'm gonna actually serve it

10:27.527 --> 10:29.663
- in this lovely, lovely dish.
- Oh, in the bowl.

10:29.697 --> 10:33.533
- Dessert, where we going?
- A rose saffron
flavored bread pudding.

10:33.566 --> 10:35.035
- What is it with you and rose?
- I really, really love rose.

10:35.068 --> 10:36.436
Do you sprinkle it
on the bed--

10:36.469 --> 10:38.505
For 25 years,
I've not missed a single one

10:38.538 --> 10:40.774
for my wife's birthday
and our anniversary.

10:40.808 --> 10:42.976
I love my wife so much,
and I give her roses

10:43.010 --> 10:45.278
every single birthday
and our anniversary.

10:45.312 --> 10:47.047
Even through
this competition,

10:47.080 --> 10:48.849
I made sure
that she had the roses.

10:48.882 --> 10:50.383
I'm missing my wife
a little bit,

10:50.417 --> 10:52.485
because we have never been away
for three, four weeks.

10:52.519 --> 10:53.954
What do you miss the most?

10:53.987 --> 10:55.989
Just hearing her voice
and being with her.

10:56.023 --> 10:58.458
She's the reason
I'm here, Chef.
She pushed me.

10:58.491 --> 11:00.828
Her support is what
is driving me here.

11:00.861 --> 11:04.464
She's been the guiding light
of all my life and career.

11:04.497 --> 11:06.967
- You okay?
- I'm good. I'm good.
I'm fantastic.

11:07.000 --> 11:08.401
I will make my wife proud.

11:08.435 --> 11:09.903
I'm gonna cook
even more with vigor.

11:09.937 --> 11:11.739
Good luck.

11:14.674 --> 11:15.909
Guys, we're coming up
to halfway!

11:15.943 --> 11:18.478
30 minutes remaining, guys.

11:18.511 --> 11:21.181
Get that dessert in the oven.

11:21.214 --> 11:22.582
Awesome.

11:24.584 --> 11:26.253
- How's it going, Sam?
- Good.

11:26.286 --> 11:28.421
Trying to get my dessert in
in the next couple minutes.

11:28.455 --> 11:31.358
I've been in the bottom,
and I haven't cooked

11:31.391 --> 11:34.061
that much food
that I'm really proud of.

11:34.094 --> 11:36.329
So I'm really hoping
to redeem myself

11:36.363 --> 11:37.931
by taking a simple dish

11:37.965 --> 11:39.666
that my mom made me
when I was growing up

11:39.699 --> 11:42.870
and trying to elevate it
to the MasterChef level.

11:42.903 --> 11:45.272
- Sam, what are you making?
What's the plan?
- Chef.

11:45.305 --> 11:47.775
I'm gonna make a fish
that's breaded

11:47.808 --> 11:50.043
- with breadcrumbs, dill--
- You're gonna bake it
in the oven?

11:50.077 --> 11:52.846
No, what I was gonna do
is do flour, egg wash,

11:52.880 --> 11:55.015
and then just cook it
in some butter.

11:55.048 --> 11:57.250
All right, great.
So what are you doing
for the dessert?

11:57.284 --> 11:59.586
For the dessert, I'm gonna do
a spiced bread pudding,

11:59.619 --> 12:01.188
which I'm trying
to get together now.

12:01.221 --> 12:02.756
Joe: Are you soaking
your stale bread yet?

12:02.790 --> 12:04.191
My bread right now
is in the oven.

12:04.224 --> 12:05.926
I'm trying to dry it out
a little bit first,

12:05.959 --> 12:07.560
and as soon as it dries out
and I get this custard together

12:07.594 --> 12:09.096
I'm gonna soak it
before I put it in the oven.

12:09.129 --> 12:10.697
- Good luck, Sam.
- Thank you. Thank you both.

12:10.730 --> 12:12.632
Wait, Bri, you're making
a clafoutis, right?

12:12.665 --> 12:14.968
- Yeah.
- Shari: Make it beautiful, Bri.

12:15.002 --> 12:17.871
I will, don't worry.

12:17.905 --> 12:20.307
Bri: I wanna show
the judges my style,

12:20.340 --> 12:22.242
and I just love
French-inspired food.

12:22.275 --> 12:24.644
So I just try to draw
inspiration from my first job

12:24.677 --> 12:26.713
hostessing at a nice
French restaurant.

12:26.746 --> 12:29.316
Aarón:
All right, Bri, what do we got
going on here, young lady?

12:29.349 --> 12:34.221
This is a blackberry compote
for my dessert, which is
a berry clafoutis.

12:34.254 --> 12:36.623
- Love that.
- And then I have a French
onion soup going over there.

12:36.656 --> 12:40.093
Bri, Bri. French onion soup is
the ugliest dish of all time.

12:40.127 --> 12:42.762
I'm gonna embrace it and go
a little more rustic with it,

12:42.796 --> 12:44.431
- but elevated rustic.
- But that's just the word--

12:44.464 --> 12:46.433
it's the beauty
and the beast.

12:46.466 --> 12:48.168
How do you elevate the beast
to become a beauty?

12:48.201 --> 12:51.238
I'm gonna make sure my bread
bowl is perfectly golden brown,

12:51.271 --> 12:53.640
- and then I'm gonna put it
on that wooden board.
- It's good. You try that?

12:53.673 --> 12:55.275
- You like it?
Okay, thank you.
- It's very good.

12:55.308 --> 12:57.010
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

12:57.044 --> 12:58.778
I'm feeling extremely
confident.

12:58.812 --> 13:00.580
Although I haven't particularly

13:00.613 --> 13:02.649
made this exact dessert before,

13:02.682 --> 13:06.019
I am meticulous, and I am
very detail-orientated,

13:06.053 --> 13:07.654
and I know that
I can plate it beautifully

13:07.687 --> 13:09.422
because I already have
the idea in my head

13:09.456 --> 13:12.325
of how I want it to look.

13:12.359 --> 13:16.296
- Awesome.
- Burn. Burn, fat, burn.

13:18.131 --> 13:20.100
- Oh, boy.
- Micah: That looks beautiful,
Dorian.

13:20.133 --> 13:22.302
Ooh, that is a gorgeous sear.

13:22.335 --> 13:24.271
Thank you.

13:24.304 --> 13:26.173
Dorian:
When I first got here,

13:26.206 --> 13:28.675
I wasn't sure which route
I was gonna go.

13:28.708 --> 13:30.343
I was cooking everything.

13:30.377 --> 13:33.046
And now I'm starting
to accept my southern roots,

13:33.080 --> 13:34.882
and that's
what I'm gonna do now.

13:34.915 --> 13:38.518
It's all about those
homey down south flavors.

13:38.551 --> 13:40.387
- Right, Dorian.
- Yes, Chef.

13:40.420 --> 13:42.122
- How are we feeling?
That looks nice.
- Pretty good.

13:42.155 --> 13:44.124
Tell me about the dish.
What are you doing?

13:44.157 --> 13:47.627
I'm doing
a pan-fried pork chop...

13:47.660 --> 13:49.196
- Yes.
- ...with bread stuffing

13:49.229 --> 13:51.298
and a chocolate turtle
bread pudding.

13:51.331 --> 13:53.700
- You are desperate
for that top ten, aren't you?
- I want it so bad.

13:53.733 --> 13:55.869
I've been in the bottom
too long, Chef.

13:55.903 --> 13:58.138
I've been in
these challenges too much
not to make it to top ten.

13:58.171 --> 13:59.706
- But you've got this,
girl, yes?
- Yes.

13:59.739 --> 14:01.708
Sounds amazing.
Be careful of that chop, okay?

14:01.741 --> 14:03.310
- Yes. Won't.
- Don't overcook it.

14:03.343 --> 14:04.744
Good luck.

14:07.948 --> 14:11.084
- Ah!
- Subha, that smells amazing.

14:11.118 --> 14:13.086
All right, gentlemen,
so the truth of the matter is

14:13.120 --> 14:15.588
that one of these
talented home cooks
is going home tonight.

14:15.622 --> 14:18.525
Could you imagine
if your MasterChef dream
ends on bread?

14:18.558 --> 14:20.327
Yeah, I mean, the irony.

14:20.360 --> 14:23.363
Ten minutes to go.
Come on, guys, let's go.

14:23.396 --> 14:26.833
Micah: Don't forget
about your desserts, guys.

14:26.866 --> 14:28.835
Fred: Nick hasn't even
started his dessert yet.

14:28.868 --> 14:30.938
Gotta start on
your dessert, man.

14:30.971 --> 14:32.372
Nick is behind,
and I'm worried

14:32.405 --> 14:34.207
that he is not be able
to finish on time.

14:34.241 --> 14:36.776
I'm worried that he took too big
of a risk for his own good.

14:49.789 --> 14:51.891
Seven minutes to go, guys.
Let's go.

14:51.925 --> 14:55.062
- My God.
- Everything is going
beautifully.

14:55.095 --> 14:57.530
Main concern
I'm worried about is making
sure my meatloaf is done.

14:57.564 --> 15:00.467
I'm not gonna
serve them raw meat.

15:00.500 --> 15:03.203
- Fingers crossed.
- Gordon: I'm worried.

15:03.236 --> 15:05.872
- Renee has-- yeah, meatloaf.
- Meatloaf.

15:05.905 --> 15:07.140
I don't know if that's
gonna be cooked in time.

15:07.174 --> 15:08.708
I think she might be
risking too much.

15:08.741 --> 15:11.578
I've seen dishes
of such a high level today.

15:11.611 --> 15:13.413
- We're way,
way beyond meatloaf.
- Gordon: Yeah.

15:16.116 --> 15:18.451
Where's the basil?
Oh, God, come on!

15:18.485 --> 15:20.653
Are you kidding me?
Come on! Whatever.

15:20.687 --> 15:23.156
Nick:
I'm starting to freak out

15:23.190 --> 15:25.325
because I have a total imbalance

15:25.358 --> 15:27.160
in the time spent between
my dessert and entrée.

15:27.194 --> 15:28.828
All right, Nick,
the timing's gonna be

15:28.861 --> 15:30.663
important for you,
young man.

15:30.697 --> 15:32.765
My entrée worked out the way
it played out in my mind

15:32.799 --> 15:35.002
and I think the judges
will like it.

15:35.035 --> 15:36.669
Nick needs to get
some sort of thing
going for his dessert.

15:36.703 --> 15:38.905
- He's working on it.
- But now I'm realizing

15:38.938 --> 15:40.673
I probably shouldn't be
experimenting so much

15:40.707 --> 15:41.741
in an elimination challenge.

15:41.774 --> 15:43.510
Time's almost run out,

15:43.543 --> 15:46.646
and I'm just trying
to make a simple dessert,

15:46.679 --> 15:49.516
one that I can very easily
make in three minutes.

15:49.549 --> 15:52.452
Four and a half minutes to go.
Let's go, Subha, Sam.

15:52.485 --> 15:55.122
Think about the plating.

15:55.155 --> 15:57.991
Sam: This dish is me cooking
for my life at "MasterChef."

15:58.025 --> 15:59.626
You know,
I've been here awhile.

15:59.659 --> 16:01.794
I miss my wife.
I miss my son.

16:01.828 --> 16:03.530
It's definitely on my mind.

16:03.563 --> 16:06.266
But today all I'm thinking about
is this dish and nailing it

16:06.299 --> 16:08.468
so I can stay
in the MasterChef kitchen
one day longer.

16:10.903 --> 16:14.041
- Let's go, Dorian.
- Just wanna make it crisp.

16:14.074 --> 16:17.944
Come on. 186. Yes!

16:17.977 --> 16:21.448
Two minutes.
Now we should start plating.

16:21.481 --> 16:23.783
- Oh, my God.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
- Gordon: Speed up.

16:23.816 --> 16:26.886
- Shari: Subha's dessert
doesn't look cooked.
- Fred: It doesn't.

16:26.919 --> 16:28.955
- I'm so stressed.
- Fred: I'm so worried
for Bri, though.

16:28.988 --> 16:31.191
She's struggling with
getting it out of the mold.

16:31.224 --> 16:33.526
- Aarón: Use a spoon.
- Oh, shoot.

16:33.560 --> 16:34.861
The tools of refinement.

16:34.894 --> 16:37.397
- Oh, my gosh.
- Oh.

16:37.430 --> 16:39.166
Gordon:
60 seconds to go, guys.
Last minute, please.

16:39.199 --> 16:41.468
Aarón: Let's think about
your garnishes, everyone,

16:41.501 --> 16:42.669
how you're plating.
Let's go!

16:44.204 --> 16:45.938
Let's go, Sarah.
Don't be hesitant.

16:49.342 --> 16:50.710
Micah:
Finish strong, guys.

16:50.743 --> 16:52.145
Make sure those plates
are gorgeous.

16:52.179 --> 16:54.214
- Shari: You got this.
- Dorian: Sage.

16:54.247 --> 16:56.416
- Oh, whoa.

16:57.717 --> 16:58.985
Sorry, Dorian.

16:59.018 --> 17:01.221
Come on, Nick.
Push through.

17:01.254 --> 17:03.556
- Come on!
- Shari: Looks good, Renee.

17:03.590 --> 17:06.359
- Finishing touches, guys.
- Here we go.

17:06.393 --> 17:09.496
Ten, night, eight, seven,

17:09.529 --> 17:12.665
six, five, four,

17:12.699 --> 17:15.034
three, two, one.

17:15.068 --> 17:16.603
And stop.
Hands in the air!

17:18.238 --> 17:20.273
Well done, guys.

17:20.307 --> 17:21.574
Whew.

17:21.608 --> 17:22.875
Ooh.

17:22.909 --> 17:25.445
Yes!

17:25.478 --> 17:28.515
I cannot be more proud
of myself right now.

17:28.548 --> 17:31.118
I-I have no words.
I have absolutely no words.

17:31.151 --> 17:33.153
I'm so happy.

17:36.656 --> 17:40.893
- Please be done.
- Wow, what a 60 minutes.

17:40.927 --> 17:43.196
Sadly, tonight, one of you
cooked for your last time

17:43.230 --> 17:44.931
inside this
incredible kitchen.

17:44.964 --> 17:47.134
All right, first up, Nick.

17:48.901 --> 17:51.238
- Go, Nick.
- All right.

17:51.271 --> 17:54.574
Nick:
My entrée looks great,
but my dessert,

17:54.607 --> 17:57.043
it's a bit
of an embarrassment.

17:57.076 --> 17:58.911
I usually can
execute pretty well,

17:58.945 --> 18:00.880
but this was different.
This was something that--

18:00.913 --> 18:03.883
that got the best of me.

18:03.916 --> 18:05.885
It's hard to look down
at something

18:05.918 --> 18:07.954
and know that you could
have done a far better job.

18:07.987 --> 18:10.623
Give us a description
of your dishes, please.

18:10.657 --> 18:12.392
My entrée is a bread
and potato gnocchi

18:12.425 --> 18:16.429
with uni butter and an
applewood smoked egg yolk.

18:16.463 --> 18:19.432
And my dessert,
a strawberry shortcake

18:19.466 --> 18:21.901
on a basil butter
toasted brioche.

18:21.934 --> 18:23.670
Gnocchi.

18:23.703 --> 18:25.472
- Yeah.
- So you've never
made it before?

18:25.505 --> 18:28.007
- No.
- Never made it before.

18:28.040 --> 18:30.109
- A lot of guessing.
- Joe: Yeah.

18:30.143 --> 18:33.079
Do you know what the enemy
of gnocchi are?

18:33.112 --> 18:34.614
Flour.

18:34.647 --> 18:37.450
Because flour will
make gnocchi hard.

18:37.484 --> 18:40.587
And you were going at that flour
like Pablo Escobar.

18:40.620 --> 18:43.423
So, I hope that
they're not too hard.

18:43.456 --> 18:44.857
Gordon: Shall we?

18:47.460 --> 18:50.263
Is your gnocchi
a little dense? Yes.

18:50.297 --> 18:53.300
But the flavor
in the gnocchi
are really good.

18:53.333 --> 18:56.203
The sauce is top-notch.
This uni butter
with the egg yolk

18:56.236 --> 18:58.338
is really playing
at a high game.

18:58.371 --> 19:01.674
All right, so tell us
about this dessert.

19:01.708 --> 19:04.277
I think my dessert is sort of
a "MasterChef Junior" dessert.

19:04.311 --> 19:06.213
I put a bunch of basil
and butter in a pan

19:06.246 --> 19:08.881
and tried to get all
the flavor out of the basil

19:08.915 --> 19:10.650
and hopefully
into the bread,

19:10.683 --> 19:13.019
and then just made
a pretty simple vanilla bean
whipped cream.

19:13.052 --> 19:16.055
I would've loved
to compress the strawberries
if I had time, but I didn't.

19:16.088 --> 19:18.225
Gordon:
I think you're right.

19:18.258 --> 19:20.193
That dish would've stood up
ten years ago at the age of 12

19:20.227 --> 19:22.028
- in "MasterChef Junior."
- Yeah.

19:22.061 --> 19:24.331
But I love your ambition.

19:24.364 --> 19:26.533
I think that's one thing
that's clearly evident.

19:26.566 --> 19:29.402
You're smoking an egg
over applewood.

19:29.436 --> 19:31.904
Sea urchin uni over gnocchi.

19:31.938 --> 19:33.540
I just love that creativity,

19:33.573 --> 19:34.907
but it's hard to pull off.

19:34.941 --> 19:36.743
- Yep. Thank you.
- Thank you.

19:39.412 --> 19:41.147
Nick: This definitely
isn't my best showing,

19:41.180 --> 19:42.982
and this isn't
what I want to represent

19:43.015 --> 19:46.185
in the MasterChef kitchen.

19:46.219 --> 19:49.155
But I think I showed the judges
that I have this passion

19:49.188 --> 19:50.890
that not many other
people have.

19:50.923 --> 19:55.061
- Okay, next, Dorian.

19:55.094 --> 19:57.997
Dorian:
I'm walking up to the judges
and I'm literally shaking,

19:58.030 --> 20:01.734
because I want this pork chop
to be done right so bad.

20:01.768 --> 20:05.772
If the pork chop is raw,
I'm done.

20:05.805 --> 20:08.174
I'm shaking.

20:08.207 --> 20:09.676
Please, tell us
what you've prepared for us.

20:09.709 --> 20:13.380
I have a pan-fried pork chop

20:13.413 --> 20:15.448
with a baguette stuffing

20:15.482 --> 20:18.050
and white wine
and honey-glazed carrots.

20:18.084 --> 20:20.920
So the big secret
is the temperature.

20:20.953 --> 20:23.590
You cooked that
in a cast iron?

20:23.623 --> 20:25.124
Uh, no.

20:25.157 --> 20:27.026
- No? What'd you cook it in?
- I did not.

20:27.059 --> 20:31.764
I cooked it in,
um, oil in a nonstick.

20:31.798 --> 20:33.866
I hope that it's done properly.

20:33.900 --> 20:35.468
We'll find out.

20:35.502 --> 20:37.870
Dorian: That first cut
will tell the tale.

20:39.672 --> 20:42.275
I'm just hoping
that this cut is perfect,

20:42.309 --> 20:44.010
'cause if not, I'm going home.

20:46.679 --> 20:49.015
- Oh, boy.
- Oh, my God.

20:57.757 --> 21:00.727
I have a pan-fried pork chop.

21:00.760 --> 21:02.929
I hope that
it's done properly.

21:02.962 --> 21:04.331
We'll find out.

21:17.009 --> 21:19.145
- Oh, boy.
- Beautiful.

21:19.178 --> 21:20.980
- Joe: Wow.
- Gorgeous.

21:21.013 --> 21:22.349
- Uh, Dorian.
- Yes?

21:22.382 --> 21:25.952
That's called perfection
right there.

21:27.153 --> 21:29.356
That is absolute spot-on.

21:29.389 --> 21:31.858
- Good job, Dorian.
- Man, what's the seasoning
in the crust?

21:31.891 --> 21:33.660
Uh, it's, uh--

21:33.693 --> 21:36.329
- You okay?
- No, I'm not.

21:36.363 --> 21:38.331
It's, um, salt, pepper,

21:38.365 --> 21:41.534
a little bit of cayenne,
because I love spice.

21:44.504 --> 21:47.340
Aside from
the excellent flavors,

21:47.374 --> 21:49.776
to be able to take
an 18-ounce pork chop
like that

21:49.809 --> 21:52.512
and cook it in a pan
and keep it moist and pink

21:52.545 --> 21:54.514
and crispy on the outside

21:54.547 --> 21:57.484
is an accomplishment
by any chef of any level.

21:57.517 --> 21:59.452
Gordon: Mm-hmm.
You've given us
an amazing entrée.

21:59.486 --> 22:01.020
with what looks
to be a delicious dessert.

22:01.053 --> 22:02.789
Tell us about that.

22:02.822 --> 22:06.626
The dessert
is a chocolate turtle
bread pudding,

22:06.659 --> 22:07.727
so it's really rich.

22:07.760 --> 22:09.862
It should be really rich.

22:12.665 --> 22:14.801
- This is a two-hand dessert.
- Man.

22:14.834 --> 22:18.471
Dorian, O-M-G.

22:18.505 --> 22:20.006
- Oh, thank you.
- Delicious.

22:20.039 --> 22:22.509
It's indulgent,
it's rich, it's a treat.

22:22.542 --> 22:26.846
- If you make it
to this year's finale...
- Wow.

22:26.879 --> 22:29.582
- ...put that dessert on there.
- Oh, thank you.

22:29.616 --> 22:32.084
- I just made it up.
- Aarón: That--

22:32.118 --> 22:34.020
yeah, I think I'll give you
a southern compliment.

22:34.053 --> 22:36.923
- You put your foot in it.
- Thank you.

22:36.956 --> 22:39.592
Fantastic. Dorian,
I drop my spoon to you.

22:39.626 --> 22:43.029
- Fantastic dessert.
- Gordon: Wow. Amazing.

22:43.062 --> 22:45.932
Dorian:
I'm absolutely over the moon.

22:45.965 --> 22:48.835
A spoon drop from Joe
is the highest praise

22:48.868 --> 22:52.772
that anybody in my position
could possibly get.

22:54.373 --> 22:55.942
Wuta, so what do we have here?

22:55.975 --> 22:59.045
Tomato and cream
with Cajun spice

22:59.078 --> 23:01.548
in the sourdough bread soup.

23:01.581 --> 23:03.349
Is this your first opportunity
of cooking a vegetarian dish?

23:03.382 --> 23:05.952
Yes, and I'm very happy
to cook a vegetarian dish.

23:07.286 --> 23:08.588
Masterful seasoning.

23:08.621 --> 23:10.256
May seem a little simple,

23:10.289 --> 23:11.891
but on the spoon,
it delivers.

23:11.924 --> 23:15.294
For dessert we have bread
and banana tarte tatin.

23:15.327 --> 23:19.632
You seem more relaxed tonight
cooking with no protein,
and it showed.

23:19.666 --> 23:21.468
- I love it.
- I really like it.

23:21.501 --> 23:22.969
- Yeah?
- I didn't think I would,
but I do.

23:23.002 --> 23:25.104
Great job, Wuta.

23:25.137 --> 23:27.039
I'm watching all these
other home cooks go up,

23:27.073 --> 23:29.976
and I am so glad to be
up on the balcony right now.

23:30.009 --> 23:32.712
So what we have is
an awesome chicken piccata.

23:32.745 --> 23:35.648
I made the breadcrumbs
from drying out
the sourdough rind,

23:35.682 --> 23:36.949
puréeing them with parsley,
thyme, garlic,

23:36.983 --> 23:38.585
a little bit of pecorino.

23:40.753 --> 23:43.222
You cook with heart.
It's not your best dish,

23:43.255 --> 23:45.124
but I love the crunch
of the bread on top.

23:48.294 --> 23:51.631
For the bread pudding,
we have a raspberry
Anglaise base.

23:51.664 --> 23:54.467
Fred:
This level of competition,
it's through the roof.

23:54.501 --> 23:56.402
Everything is definitely
restaurant quality.

23:56.435 --> 23:59.105
Aarón:
I love how robust
the flavors are.

23:59.138 --> 24:01.474
You took it to a place
that speaks to you.

24:01.508 --> 24:04.143
- Thank y'all.
- These guys are stepping up
their game this season.

24:04.176 --> 24:06.479
I'm definitely worried.
This is my competition.

24:06.513 --> 24:10.416
Jamie:
We have a pecan and breadcrumb
encrusted red snapper.

24:10.449 --> 24:11.918
Gordon:
The breading is delicious.

24:11.951 --> 24:13.319
It's vibrant.
It's a lovely crumb.

24:13.352 --> 24:15.488
I can even see a gratin
of just the spinach

24:15.522 --> 24:16.823
with that breadcrumb on top.

24:16.856 --> 24:18.157
That's what I was gonna say.

24:18.190 --> 24:19.992
- You don't even need the fish.
- Yeah.

24:20.026 --> 24:21.928
It's a beautiful side dish,
that's how good it is.

24:21.961 --> 24:23.596
Joe: Tell us
about this dessert.

24:23.630 --> 24:26.332
We've got a French toast stack
with caramelized bananas

24:26.365 --> 24:29.435
and raw bananas
with pecan dust on top.

24:29.468 --> 24:30.637
Aarón:
I just love the fact

24:30.670 --> 24:32.505
that you really took
your time with it.

24:32.539 --> 24:34.206
- It's really spectacular.
- Gordon: I love the finesse.

24:34.240 --> 24:35.608
You're studying hard.
I can see that.

24:35.642 --> 24:37.710
- I am.
- Continue taking those risks.

24:37.744 --> 24:39.612
It's important
to burst out.

24:39.646 --> 24:41.180
- I'm on the verge.
- Good job.

24:41.213 --> 24:42.649
- Thanks so much, guys.
- Thank you.

24:44.684 --> 24:46.118
- That's what
I'm talking about, man.
- Good job, Jamie.

24:46.152 --> 24:47.353
How good is that
cook on there? Come on.

24:47.386 --> 24:49.055
- That was great.

24:49.088 --> 24:51.190
Gordon: I mean, seriously.
Guys, it's season ten.

24:51.223 --> 24:52.959
This year more than ever,

24:52.992 --> 24:55.061
the level of cooking
is extraordinary.

24:55.094 --> 24:58.164
The finesse that we've seen
so far has been incredible.

24:58.197 --> 25:01.133
I just hope there's more.

25:01.167 --> 25:03.335
Next up, Sarah,
please, let's go.

25:05.104 --> 25:07.540
Sarah:
Right now I'm kicking myself,

25:07.574 --> 25:11.243
because once again
I waited until the very
last minute to plate.

25:11.277 --> 25:13.880
So, we'll see
how it turns out.

25:15.081 --> 25:17.349
Describe both dishes,
please.

25:17.383 --> 25:20.653
So, I have for you a bread
and herb crusted halibut

25:20.687 --> 25:22.889
and a breadcrumb gnocchi.

25:22.922 --> 25:25.758
For dessert, I have
a brioche bread pudding

25:25.792 --> 25:29.528
with a raspberry jam
infused with lavender.

25:29.562 --> 25:30.997
The fish looks sparse for me.

25:31.030 --> 25:32.531
There must be
something missing there.

25:32.565 --> 25:34.767
- Yes.
- No sauce?

25:34.801 --> 25:36.869
So I made a brown butter
and sage sauce,

25:36.903 --> 25:40.206
but I waited until
the last minute to plate

25:40.239 --> 25:42.575
- and I didn't get it on there.
- What's in the gnocchi?

25:42.609 --> 25:45.511
So, it's breadcrumbs
that I toasted in the oven

25:45.544 --> 25:47.780
and kind of pulverized down,

25:47.814 --> 25:50.549
potato,
and a little bit of egg.

25:50.583 --> 25:52.619
- And then just--
- Very nice. Light, sweet.

25:52.652 --> 25:53.920
Thank you.

25:53.953 --> 25:55.454
The dessert.

26:02.829 --> 26:06.398
The pudding is delicious.
Rich, sumptuous.

26:06.432 --> 26:09.101
- Thank you.
- Yeah, I put this in the same
category as Dorian's.

26:09.135 --> 26:10.603
It's like a fruit version
of hers.

26:10.637 --> 26:13.640
It's really flavorful.
The bread comes through.

26:13.673 --> 26:16.042
And bread two ways
just for the entrée?
Delicious.

26:16.075 --> 26:18.444
- Thank you, Chef.
- I just gotta get you
a little bit more refined.

26:18.477 --> 26:21.047
- Those last 15 minutes,
think about the sauce.
- Okay.

26:21.080 --> 26:23.049
- Good job.
- Thank you, Chef.
Thank you, Joe.

26:23.082 --> 26:24.316
- Good job, Sarah.
- Good job, Sarah.

26:24.350 --> 26:25.752
- Good job, Sarah.
- Great job.

26:25.785 --> 26:28.788
Bri.

26:31.490 --> 26:33.660
Bri: I'm really proud
to present this dish.

26:33.693 --> 26:36.462
I decided to show the judges
another side of me,

26:36.495 --> 26:38.665
and I decide to go
a little bit more rustic.

26:38.698 --> 26:42.468
But I had
a very conceptualized,
clear concept

26:42.501 --> 26:45.772
and it's really everything
I wanted it to be.

26:45.805 --> 26:47.907
Okay, Bri,
what did you make for us?

26:47.940 --> 26:51.110
I made a French onion soup
topped with gruyere cheese

26:51.143 --> 26:53.145
served in a sourdough
bread bowl.

26:53.179 --> 26:55.614
And, dessert,
I made a blackberry clafoutis

26:55.648 --> 26:58.117
with a brioche
pistachio crumble.

26:58.150 --> 27:00.586
Yeah, I look at these dishes,
and I'm just--

27:00.619 --> 27:03.322
how was 60 minutes
used to your advantage?

27:03.355 --> 27:06.025
Gordon:
The challenge was bread,

27:06.058 --> 27:08.494
so you can't come up
with a crisp on the end
and stick it on top.

27:08.527 --> 27:10.997
There is brioche
in the pistachio crumble.

27:11.030 --> 27:13.365
Brioche? That's all you have
as a bread dessert?

27:13.399 --> 27:15.534
And the pistachio crumble
as well.

27:15.567 --> 27:17.336
I don't know.
I look at that, Bri,

27:17.369 --> 27:21.107
and I think that is not you,
I'm gonna be honest.

27:21.140 --> 27:24.176
The soup,
let's get in there, shall we?

27:24.210 --> 27:27.179
So, a nice color on onions,
let's get that right.

27:27.213 --> 27:31.117
But, you see,
here's the problem.

27:31.150 --> 27:32.384
There's no soup
in your soup.

27:32.418 --> 27:35.654
Oh, my God.

27:38.490 --> 27:40.326
Damn.

27:40.359 --> 27:43.329
Quite frankly,
it's not season ten worthy.

27:43.362 --> 27:44.897
When you climb so high

27:44.931 --> 27:48.400
and you reach
a certain point and you fall,

27:48.434 --> 27:51.137
- the fall is steep.
- Gordon: Right.

27:51.170 --> 27:53.205
Where do we start from this?

27:53.239 --> 27:55.474
The dessert, for me,
is an insult to France.

27:55.507 --> 27:58.577
A clafoutis is actually
cooked in the mold.

27:58.610 --> 28:00.813
You don't scoop the middle out
and dump it on the plate.

28:00.847 --> 28:03.750
And some of the wow desserts
out there tonight?

28:03.783 --> 28:07.253
I'm-- I'm amazed
you've come up this bad.

28:16.963 --> 28:20.099
The shock for me
is that you sabotaged
your own success

28:20.132 --> 28:22.001
scooping it out,
dolloping it on a plate.

28:22.034 --> 28:24.703
It's not because the oven
was too hot

28:24.737 --> 28:26.773
or the insufficient time.

28:26.806 --> 28:28.875
The actual dessert
tastes good,

28:28.908 --> 28:30.076
it's just what
you've done to it.

28:32.444 --> 28:35.714
- Okay. Thank you.
- Joe and Aarón: Thank you.

28:35.748 --> 28:37.616
Thank you.

28:37.649 --> 28:38.951
Chin up, girlie.

28:41.954 --> 28:44.757
- You're fine. You're fine.
- I guess.

28:44.791 --> 28:49.395
Bri: I'm just
feeling disappointed.

28:49.428 --> 28:52.431
I wanna disappear, basically.

28:55.734 --> 28:57.736
Sorry.

29:13.619 --> 29:17.123
All right, the next home cook
would be Sam, please.

29:20.026 --> 29:22.061
Sam: The thing
that's gonna stand out
the most in this dish

29:22.094 --> 29:23.996
is the different ways
I used bread

29:24.030 --> 29:25.731
and the versatility of it.

29:25.764 --> 29:27.066
I definitely want the judges

29:27.099 --> 29:29.101
to see that I'm a fighter

29:29.135 --> 29:30.803
because somebody's going home,

29:30.837 --> 29:32.571
and as long as it's not me,
I'm okay with it.

29:32.604 --> 29:34.573
Sam, can you please
describe your dishes?

29:34.606 --> 29:38.477
Yes, Chef. Today, I have
a dill-crusted snapper

29:38.510 --> 29:42.448
with a caper brown butter sauce
and Romesco potatoes,

29:42.481 --> 29:45.184
and a cardamom-spiced
bread pudding.

29:45.217 --> 29:46.652
The potatoes smell incredible.

29:46.685 --> 29:49.655
I love the presentation
of the dessert,

29:49.688 --> 29:52.925
but it shouldn't look
better than your main.

29:52.959 --> 29:56.162
When you've got fish like that
and you're breading it twice,

29:56.195 --> 29:57.629
top and bottom,
you've got to be very careful

29:57.663 --> 29:59.465
the actual bread
is not thicker than the fish.

29:59.498 --> 30:01.767
So, I'm hoping the fish
is not overcooked.

30:01.800 --> 30:03.069
Shall we?

30:06.172 --> 30:07.840
Yeah, see, that's over.

30:07.874 --> 30:09.375
Yeah, fish is overcooked.
Okay.

30:15.547 --> 30:18.550
It's fresh snapper, right?
So, that's barely 24 hours old,

30:18.584 --> 30:20.386
and you've turned it
into something that tastes

30:20.419 --> 30:22.955
almost like it's
a commercial frozen product

30:22.989 --> 30:25.357
because you can't identify
what fish that is in there.

30:25.391 --> 30:28.560
I think the highlight for me
is the potatoes.

30:28.594 --> 30:30.529
But it's not
a potato challenge, Sam.

30:30.562 --> 30:31.663
You know, it's a--
it's a bread challenge.

30:31.697 --> 30:34.400
Understood, Chef.

30:34.433 --> 30:36.302
Unfortunately,
as we approach the final 12,

30:36.335 --> 30:39.972
the complete lack of finesse
on the preparation of the fish,

30:40.006 --> 30:42.541
the overcooked nature
of the protein itself,
at this point,

30:42.574 --> 30:45.077
I think we need
to see more than that,
quite frankly.

30:45.111 --> 30:46.712
Understood.
Thank you, Joe.

30:48.948 --> 30:50.950
Dessert.

30:57.389 --> 30:58.790
All I taste is honey.

30:59.959 --> 31:02.861
Man, honey is dangerous.

31:02.895 --> 31:04.663
- It covers up everything.
- Forget the honey.

31:04.696 --> 31:07.566
Apricot citrus glaze
would've absolutely
lifted that dish.

31:07.599 --> 31:10.269
- Understood, Chef.
- Thank you.

31:10.302 --> 31:11.870
Sam:
Walking away from the tasting,

31:11.904 --> 31:13.672
I definitely feel
like I'm at risk.

31:13.705 --> 31:15.241
I really did put my heart
and soul into this dish,

31:15.274 --> 31:17.609
but, obviously,
their opinion is paramount.

31:17.643 --> 31:20.179
So, hopefully
it'll be enough today.

31:20.212 --> 31:22.949
Next up, Subha, please.
Let's go.

31:22.982 --> 31:25.584
Subha:
These two dishes
have to be good.

31:25.617 --> 31:27.519
If not, I'm going home,

31:27.553 --> 31:29.755
because simple cooking
is not gonna cut it anymore.

31:31.723 --> 31:33.092
Describe the dish, please.

31:33.125 --> 31:35.594
Today, we have
a chicken mulligatawny soup

31:35.627 --> 31:37.263
served in a toasted bread bowl,

31:37.296 --> 31:40.967
and bread pudding with rose
and saffron flavored milk base.

31:41.000 --> 31:42.969
Mulligatawny.
I grew up with this.

31:43.002 --> 31:45.771
I know tonight you got
a little bit emotional.

31:45.804 --> 31:48.707
This is all about home
and cooking for the wife.

31:48.740 --> 31:51.377
- Are you homesick?
- Yes, my wife,
I love her dearly.

31:51.410 --> 31:54.613
But, you know,
I hope that I made her
proud with this dish.

31:54.646 --> 31:55.814
Let's dig in and taste it,
shall we?

32:06.092 --> 32:08.260
I've never eaten anything
quite like this before.

32:10.462 --> 32:13.632
Gordon: Subha, guess
what I'm doing tonight.

32:13.665 --> 32:16.468
I'm calling my mum.

32:16.502 --> 32:18.737
And I'm gonna tell her,
in a couple months time
when I get home,

32:18.770 --> 32:21.073
I want a bowl of Mulligatawny
made with chicken.

32:21.107 --> 32:23.142
Okay? It's delicious.

32:23.175 --> 32:24.910
Thank you. Thank you, Chef.

32:24.943 --> 32:26.445
Every time
I eat your spiced food,

32:26.478 --> 32:28.347
it kind of brings me
to a place

32:28.380 --> 32:32.084
where I grow to appreciate
your finesse and your flavor.

32:32.118 --> 32:34.120
- You are my teacher now.
- I'm humbled, Joe.

32:34.153 --> 32:35.754
The master has
become the student,

32:35.787 --> 32:38.957
and the student
has become the teacher.

32:38.991 --> 32:41.093
I'm very humbled.
I'm very humbled.

32:41.127 --> 32:42.694
- Good job, Subha.
- Subha: I truly am.

32:42.728 --> 32:45.531
- That is so nice.
- Fred: That is incredible.

32:45.564 --> 32:49.668
- Dessert.
- I have to say, this is
the worst-looking dessert

32:49.701 --> 32:50.702
I've ever seen in my life.

32:50.736 --> 32:52.571
It's terrible!

32:55.341 --> 32:56.808
Bro.

32:56.842 --> 32:59.011
It's not only
the worst-looking,

32:59.045 --> 33:01.547
- it's one of
the worst tasting desserts.
- Oh, my God.

33:01.580 --> 33:03.282
- It's so spicy.
- Aarón: Yeah, it's--

33:03.315 --> 33:05.884
- I'm sort of--
- Oh, man.

33:05.917 --> 33:08.620
I know. I'm like--

33:08.654 --> 33:10.989
Why does the dessert
have to be that spicy?

33:11.023 --> 33:13.492
- Gordon: Honestly.
- Subha, you're killing us.

33:13.525 --> 33:15.161
How'd you do that to us?

33:15.194 --> 33:17.829
Have you been sent by Mars
on a special mission?

33:17.863 --> 33:20.732
- Whoa!
- I'm sorry, Chef.

33:20.766 --> 33:22.401
I'll make sure
that I straighten
all those spices out

33:22.434 --> 33:23.669
and I'll go two notches.

33:23.702 --> 33:25.737
- You better.
- You better. Thank God,

33:25.771 --> 33:27.673
you haven't forgotten
how to make a mulligatawny,

33:27.706 --> 33:31.143
because that should come
with a hazard warning sign.

33:31.177 --> 33:33.179
Yes, Chef. Thank you.

33:33.212 --> 33:36.815
Walking back to my station,
I was looking at the main dish,

33:36.848 --> 33:38.717
and that was a big upper for me.

33:38.750 --> 33:41.520
And then the dessert
was a bad setback.

33:41.553 --> 33:44.223
Nice savory dish, Subha.
Dessert?

33:44.256 --> 33:45.924
But as much as I miss my wife,

33:45.957 --> 33:47.993
I want to learn,
I want to grow,

33:48.026 --> 33:49.728
and I want to be
the next MasterChef.

33:49.761 --> 33:51.997
It's sweet, but it's spicy.

33:52.030 --> 33:54.266
Next up, Renee, please.
Let's go.

33:54.300 --> 33:56.268
Let's go, Renee.

33:56.302 --> 33:58.337
Renee:
I am feeling really
proud of myself

33:58.370 --> 34:00.906
because my plates
look beautiful,

34:00.939 --> 34:05.211
and I am 100% confident
that I nailed it.

34:06.378 --> 34:08.280
Describe the dishes, please.

34:08.314 --> 34:09.581
It is a pork
and beef meatloaf

34:09.615 --> 34:11.750
with rosemary roasted
red potatoes

34:11.783 --> 34:13.619
and sautéed green beans

34:13.652 --> 34:17.189
- with a strawberry shortcake.
- Gordon: Wow.

34:17.223 --> 34:19.891
That's a very bold move to
attempt a meatloaf in 60 minutes

34:19.925 --> 34:22.194
with a strawberry shortcake.

34:22.228 --> 34:23.895
Are you confident
it's cooked inside?

34:23.929 --> 34:25.631
100% confident, Chef.

34:33.339 --> 34:36.742
So, it's a little bit-- see?

34:36.775 --> 34:38.577
What kind of meat
did you use?

34:38.610 --> 34:40.979
I used pork and beef.

34:41.012 --> 34:43.282
So, like, is that the beef
or is that the pork?

34:43.315 --> 34:45.184
Why is it white and pink
in the middle?

34:59.831 --> 35:00.966
What kind of meat
did you use?

35:00.999 --> 35:02.834
I used pork and beef.

35:02.868 --> 35:04.436
- Yeah, pork.
- That's pork, that's beef.

35:04.470 --> 35:07.072
- That's not ground, is it?
- It's not.

35:07.105 --> 35:09.040
It's like a--
No, no, it's like a piece.

35:15.013 --> 35:16.348
How much bread
did you put in there?

35:16.382 --> 35:18.850
I put maybe a cup of bread.

35:18.884 --> 35:20.752
Yeah, 'cause it's very tight.

35:20.786 --> 35:24.990
Taking bread white
and soaking it in milk

35:25.023 --> 35:27.193
and having it be a part
of a meatloaf filling

35:27.226 --> 35:30.196
is to allow it to aerate
and to bring lightness to it.

35:30.229 --> 35:32.931
This has the consistency
of mortar.

35:32.964 --> 35:34.333
Okay.

35:34.366 --> 35:37.803
Thank you for your feedback.

35:37.836 --> 35:40.306
Aarón: Here's what
I'm puzzled with, Renee.

35:40.339 --> 35:41.940
We got red bliss potatoes

35:41.973 --> 35:45.611
and we got green beans
that you can find anywhere.

35:45.644 --> 35:47.946
But we have this
unbelievable pantry there.

35:47.979 --> 35:49.781
We're trying to allow you

35:49.815 --> 35:51.817
to have this playbook
of ingredients,

35:51.850 --> 35:54.052
- and I just don't see it here.
- Okay.

35:54.085 --> 35:55.454
Behind you, you've got
individuals cooking

35:55.487 --> 35:57.155
pork chops brilliantly,

35:57.189 --> 35:59.391
chicken breast brilliantly,
handmade gnocchi.

35:59.425 --> 36:03.562
And so the meatloaf feels
like it was two months ago

36:03.595 --> 36:05.797
and not where you are
in this competition.

36:10.936 --> 36:13.639
Yeah. I mean,
I love strawberry shortcake.
That's delicious.

36:13.672 --> 36:15.874
I'm amazed you got that
kind of flavor from the bread.

36:15.907 --> 36:17.809
It's-- it tastes very good,
but at the end of the day,

36:17.843 --> 36:19.378
when you think
about the other desserts

36:19.411 --> 36:21.847
that I know that are out here,
this is just bread

36:21.880 --> 36:25.016
with macerated strawberries
and sweet cream.

36:25.050 --> 36:28.420
- Okay.
- A little basic at this time.

36:28.454 --> 36:32.858
- Yeah. Thank you, Renee.
- Thank you, guys.

36:32.891 --> 36:36.161
Renee: I am a little concerned
that I might be sent home.

36:36.194 --> 36:38.163
They did not like my entrée.

36:38.196 --> 36:40.266
That meatloaf's terrible.
So dense.

36:40.299 --> 36:43.502
But Gordon just loved
my dessert.

36:43.535 --> 36:45.337
It's 50/50.

36:45.371 --> 36:47.038
I have absolutely no idea

36:47.072 --> 36:49.040
where I'm going to be
by the end of the day.

36:49.074 --> 36:51.443
That was quite an array
of dishes tonight.

36:51.477 --> 36:52.878
We need a moment to discuss.

36:55.814 --> 36:58.083
Who has the potential
to learn?

36:58.116 --> 36:59.618
I mean, Bri's got potential.

36:59.651 --> 37:00.952
- Aarón: Yeah, Bri.
- Gordon: I expected more.

37:00.986 --> 37:02.788
I mean, French onion soup?

37:02.821 --> 37:06.592
- She's gotta be able
to step it up a notch.
- Yeah, yeah.

37:06.625 --> 37:08.460
Bri: I'm feeling
absolutely crushed.

37:08.494 --> 37:10.529
I've done great in the past,

37:10.562 --> 37:12.864
but maybe that
won't matter today.

37:12.898 --> 37:14.700
Maybe this is it.

37:14.733 --> 37:16.268
Sam: I'm nervous.

37:16.302 --> 37:17.703
I know I made mistakes,

37:17.736 --> 37:19.471
and I'm very disappointed.

37:19.505 --> 37:21.573
I could've done better.

37:21.607 --> 37:23.642
- I agree.
- You agree?

37:23.675 --> 37:27.245
Tonight, we asked you
to take a humble loaf of bread

37:27.279 --> 37:31.249
and turn it into
an entrée and a dessert.

37:31.283 --> 37:35.487
There was one home cook
that stood out.

37:35.521 --> 37:39.325
Dorian, please head upstairs
and put on that white apron.

37:39.358 --> 37:41.126
- Well done!
- Dorian: I am ecstatic.

37:41.159 --> 37:44.330
Not only am I safe,
but they loved both dishes.

37:44.363 --> 37:47.499
And I hope the judges continue
to see my progression

37:47.533 --> 37:48.967
and I hope that I can continue

37:49.000 --> 37:51.937
to give them tasty,
gorgeous food.

37:51.970 --> 37:53.805
There are three more dishes

37:53.839 --> 37:58.243
that we think deserve
special attention tonight.

37:58.276 --> 38:01.079
Sam.

38:01.112 --> 38:03.682
Bri.

38:03.715 --> 38:05.250
Renee.

38:05.283 --> 38:08.153
You three cooked the worst
dishes tonight.

38:08.186 --> 38:10.356
Please come forward.

38:10.389 --> 38:12.090
Everyone else,
go to the balcony

38:12.123 --> 38:13.091
and put on your white aprons.

38:13.124 --> 38:14.626
Thank you, Joe!

38:16.194 --> 38:19.164
My son turned one
while I was here,

38:19.197 --> 38:21.833
so I've sacrificed
a lot to be here,

38:21.867 --> 38:24.370
and I certainly
don't wanna leave
the MasterChef kitchen.

38:24.403 --> 38:27.305
There's so much more
that I can show the judges.

38:27.339 --> 38:28.807
Really tough challenge tonight.

38:28.840 --> 38:31.877
Bri, I think one
of your worst performances.

38:31.910 --> 38:36.214
- Can you do better?
- Absolutely. 100%.

38:39.217 --> 38:41.052
Sam, you know,

38:41.086 --> 38:43.455
dessert was okay,

38:43.489 --> 38:46.191
and the fish,
sadly, overcooked.

38:46.224 --> 38:48.460
You seem to be
growing in stature,

38:48.494 --> 38:50.696
but you've been
down here many times.

38:50.729 --> 38:52.197
I have been down here a lot,

38:52.230 --> 38:53.799
but I feel like
if given the opportunity,

38:53.832 --> 38:55.300
I will rise to the occasion.

38:55.333 --> 38:59.905
Renee, you know,
the dessert-- delicious.

38:59.938 --> 39:02.040
But...

39:02.073 --> 39:04.743
the meatloaf has to be one
of the biggest disappointments.

39:04.776 --> 39:06.244
Yeah.

39:06.277 --> 39:07.513
I think we just expect more.

39:07.546 --> 39:09.515
I don't want to go home, Chef.

39:09.548 --> 39:12.150
I'm going to stop laying low
and being comfortable

39:12.183 --> 39:13.919
and pull out the big guns.

39:13.952 --> 39:15.654
Gordon:
This is a tough call.

39:15.687 --> 39:20.792
The person leaving
the MasterChef kitchen is...

39:25.631 --> 39:26.898
Sam.

39:29.868 --> 39:32.671
It's all right, Sam.
Chin up, buddy.

39:32.704 --> 39:36.842
I'm feeling relieved
because my performance today

39:36.875 --> 39:39.010
could've easily
cost me my apron,

39:39.044 --> 39:43.081
and I just can't let myself
or the judges down ever again.

39:43.114 --> 39:45.851
Sam, unfortunately,
your journey has come to an end.

39:45.884 --> 39:47.252
Tonight, we felt
that everything on that plate

39:47.285 --> 39:49.254
was lacking the finesse

39:49.287 --> 39:51.457
that we've seen from you
in this competition.

39:51.490 --> 39:54.359
- Understood, Chef.
- I think this task just
got the better of you.

39:54.392 --> 39:56.962
- It's been an amazing journey.
- It has, Chef.

39:56.995 --> 39:59.097
It's just been
an amazing experience.

39:59.130 --> 40:01.232
You know, I love to cook.
I had an opportunity to cook

40:01.266 --> 40:04.202
in front of the three
best chefs and food minds
in the world.

40:04.235 --> 40:06.872
I'm just so grateful
and humbled for the opportunity.

40:06.905 --> 40:08.306
Head up high, young man.

40:08.339 --> 40:10.876
Come on.
Come and say good-bye.

40:10.909 --> 40:12.644
Sam:
Any time you don't live up,

40:12.678 --> 40:14.713
you're gonna feel
a little emotional about it,

40:14.746 --> 40:15.981
but it just speaks
to the quality

40:16.014 --> 40:17.549
of the competition here.

40:17.583 --> 40:19.918
There's a lot of really
good cooks here, so--

40:19.951 --> 40:22.654
But now I'm really looking
forward to going home

40:22.688 --> 40:24.456
to see my wife and my son.

40:24.490 --> 40:26.324
Head up, Sam.

40:28.126 --> 40:29.728
Put your hands together--
top 12.

40:29.761 --> 40:32.297
- Congratulations, come on.
- Go, baby!

40:32.330 --> 40:35.601
- We're getting closer.
- An amazing journey.

40:35.634 --> 40:37.168
Top ten is around the corner.

40:37.202 --> 40:39.571
You're gonna need some rest,

40:39.605 --> 40:41.673
because the biggest
surprises lay ahead.

40:41.707 --> 40:43.675
Trust me,
your upcoming challenge,

40:43.709 --> 40:47.145
it's definitely
the toughest one yet.

40:47.178 --> 40:49.347
Good night.
