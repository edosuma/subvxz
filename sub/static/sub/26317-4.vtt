WEBVTT

00:01.827 --> 00:03.351
Previously onSWAT...You got any word on Street?

00:03.394 --> 00:05.701
I had tried his cell three
times, but he's not picking up.

00:05.744 --> 00:06.702
KAREN:
Jimmy, I really need you

00:06.745 --> 00:08.878
to come through for me

00:08.921 --> 00:10.880
or they're-they're not
gonna finalize my parole.

00:10.923 --> 00:12.099
Are you sure you don't want
to maintain a little distance?

00:12.142 --> 00:13.491
STREET:
I'm the only family she's got.

00:13.535 --> 00:14.623
LEAH:
Nothing about parole

00:14.666 --> 00:15.841
is a formality.
LAPD needs to know

00:15.885 --> 00:17.234
if there's an
officer residing

00:17.278 --> 00:18.322
with a convicted felon.

00:18.366 --> 00:20.020
HONDO:
Street, I got to say,

00:20.063 --> 00:21.195
I think her living with you
is a bad idea.

00:21.238 --> 00:22.065
STREET:
You probably already know,

00:22.109 --> 00:23.762
but I lied.You're off SWAT.

00:23.806 --> 00:25.155
You report
to patrol duty tomorrow.

00:25.199 --> 00:27.418
We hold each other's lives
out there

00:27.462 --> 00:29.812
and I need to see
that Street gets that.

00:29.855 --> 00:31.292
Nia Wells.Daniel Harrelson.

00:31.335 --> 00:32.554
They call me Hondo, though.

00:32.597 --> 00:33.642
You're a prosecutor, huh?

00:33.685 --> 00:35.035
NIA:
Deputy D.A.

00:35.078 --> 00:36.949
NURSE: How long you
two been married?

00:36.993 --> 00:38.125
ERIC: Actually,
getting divorced.

00:38.168 --> 00:39.300
It's funny, you know,

00:39.343 --> 00:40.388
when something
like this happens,

00:40.431 --> 00:41.737
it changes how you
look at things.

00:51.225 --> 00:53.966
Hey.

00:54.010 --> 00:54.924
Hey!

00:57.622 --> 01:00.886
Graveyard supervisor didn't say
anything about any night work.

01:02.453 --> 01:05.108
Hey, put your hands
against the car.

01:05.152 --> 01:06.936
And don't go for that gun.

01:06.979 --> 01:09.547
I said put your hands
against the car!

01:50.762 --> 01:52.112
Thanks for coming over.

01:52.155 --> 01:53.548
I know my text was last minute.

01:53.591 --> 01:55.506
Well, I'm glad I did.

01:55.550 --> 01:57.726
Thanks for letting
me crash.

01:57.769 --> 01:59.815
I know me spending the night
doesn't make us a couple now.

01:59.858 --> 02:01.730
I mean, this ain't got to
be nothing more than...

02:01.773 --> 02:03.079
Than what it is.

02:03.123 --> 02:05.603
I know. We've both
got enough going on.

02:05.647 --> 02:07.562
How's work been for you?

02:07.605 --> 02:08.606
It's been good.

02:10.042 --> 02:11.696
That badge ever
start feeling heavy?

02:11.740 --> 02:13.394
Damn, woman, do you ever ask
any easy questions?

02:13.437 --> 02:15.439
[both chuckle]

02:15.483 --> 02:18.225
It can be tough at times,
but I'm glad I do it

02:18.268 --> 02:20.879
and I'm good at it.I bet you are,

02:20.923 --> 02:24.579
but I'm guessing you probably
secretly feel responsible

02:24.622 --> 02:27.321
for every win and every loss.

02:27.364 --> 02:29.192
Anyone ever tell you that
your morning-after etiquette

02:29.236 --> 02:30.585
could use a little work?

02:30.628 --> 02:31.977
[both chuckle][phone chimes]

02:35.416 --> 02:37.113
Damn it.What's up?

02:37.157 --> 02:38.941
My ex won't sign
the divorce papers yet.

02:38.984 --> 02:41.683
He's contesting my proposed
division of property.

02:41.726 --> 02:45.730
First it was the dog,
then the furniture, now this.

02:45.774 --> 02:47.471
It should have all
been over by now.

02:47.515 --> 02:50.213
You know, we got this old-timer
at my job, his name is Mumford,

02:50.257 --> 02:52.259
and he's always
saying that divorce

02:52.302 --> 02:53.651
is a marathon, not a sprint.

02:53.695 --> 02:55.305
Yeah.

02:55.349 --> 02:59.091
[sighs]
Hey.

02:59.135 --> 03:01.964
You are a legally
separated woman.

03:02.007 --> 03:03.531
That makes you free.

03:03.574 --> 03:05.141
Enjoy it.

03:05.185 --> 03:07.230
I am.

03:07.274 --> 03:12.322
These have been five of
the six best one-night stands

03:12.366 --> 03:14.019
I've ever had.

03:14.063 --> 03:16.108
Okay, whoa, whoa,
wait a minute. Ouch.

03:16.152 --> 03:19.808
Only five out of six?Yeah.

03:19.851 --> 03:22.985
There was this guy
in Houston.

03:23.028 --> 03:25.292
Long time ago.[phone beeps]

03:25.335 --> 03:27.032
[scoffs] Wow.

03:28.686 --> 03:30.514
Work.
Stay safe.

03:38.174 --> 03:41.395
SWAT's chasing
train robbers now?

03:41.438 --> 03:43.962
Well, most thefts, the railroads
use their own security,

03:44.006 --> 03:46.443
but this one came
with a homicide.Dead guard.

03:46.487 --> 03:48.880
Bullet to the head.DEACON: The suspects used

03:48.924 --> 03:51.361
an oxyacetylene torch
to cut through the forged steel.

03:51.405 --> 03:54.190
They made off with $2 million
worth of oxycodone.

03:54.234 --> 03:55.626
And then they fled
about a half a mile north

03:55.670 --> 03:56.975
through an access gate.

03:57.019 --> 03:59.500
Any leads on this crew?Well, the U.S. Marshals

03:59.543 --> 04:01.066
think it's a fugitive on
their Most Wanted list.

04:01.110 --> 04:02.677
Marshal Wells.

04:02.720 --> 04:04.940
I'd like you to meet
Sergeant Harrelson.

04:04.983 --> 04:07.464
Hey. Eric Wells.

04:07.508 --> 04:08.639
Nice to meet you, Sergeant.

04:08.683 --> 04:10.641
Marshal.

04:10.685 --> 04:12.730
Uh, the Marshals have
claimed jurisdiction,

04:12.774 --> 04:14.341
requested SWAT as backup in
the search for their fugitive.

04:14.384 --> 04:15.864
That's a new one.

04:15.907 --> 04:17.474
I thought you cowboys
normally rode alone.

04:17.518 --> 04:19.346
Well, sometimes it's
better to be in a pack

04:19.389 --> 04:21.565
than a lone wolf, right?

04:21.609 --> 04:24.089
JESSICA:
Shen Kwon was serving

04:24.133 --> 04:27.092
15 years for killing
an ATF informant.

04:27.136 --> 04:28.833
About six months ago,
he took a saw blade to a guard

04:28.877 --> 04:29.965
and escaped custody.

04:30.008 --> 04:31.880
We're a long way from Florida.

04:31.923 --> 04:34.099
What makes you so sure Kwon's
ripping off boxcars in L.A.?

04:34.143 --> 04:36.188
Well, Kwon's
specialty is cargo.

04:36.232 --> 04:38.321
If it's worth a buck and
it's shipped by plane, train

04:38.365 --> 04:41.150
or on a semitruck,
this guy will rip it off.

04:41.193 --> 04:43.457
Now, since his escape,
he's been moving west.

04:43.500 --> 04:45.502
He's targeting boxcars
full of pharmaceutical opioids

04:45.546 --> 04:47.504
and he's flipping them
wholesale to local gangs.

04:47.548 --> 04:50.159
Dallas, Santa Fe, Vegas,
they all had spikes in overdoses

04:50.202 --> 04:51.900
linked to drugs
Kwon has stolen.

04:51.943 --> 04:53.815
And we don't want him flooding
our streets with that crap.

04:53.858 --> 04:54.946
That's why I'm deputizing
you and your team.

04:54.990 --> 04:56.339
I could really
use SWAT's help

04:56.383 --> 04:57.906
getting this guy
off the street.

04:57.949 --> 04:59.124
You gentlemen coordinate
amongst yourselves.

04:59.168 --> 05:01.388
Keep us posted.Thanks, Commander.

05:01.431 --> 05:03.825
Excuse me for a second.Yeah, no sweat.

05:03.868 --> 05:06.088
Hey, Deac. I'm
gonna grab Tan,

05:06.131 --> 05:07.611
and check with
railroad security,

05:07.655 --> 05:10.135
see what kind of surveillance
footage these guys have.

05:10.179 --> 05:12.355
The oxyacetylene torch these
guys used is not exactly gear

05:12.399 --> 05:13.791
you find lying around here.

05:13.835 --> 05:16.316
You grab Chris and Luca.
Hit up Burglary.

05:16.359 --> 05:19.493
See if this crew
ripped it off from someone.

05:19.536 --> 05:22.931
[phone ringing]

05:22.974 --> 05:25.020
Hey.HONDO: Nia, hey.

05:25.063 --> 05:28.328
Listen, um, I got something
happening here.

05:28.371 --> 05:30.634
I'm on my way to court,
what's up?

05:30.678 --> 05:32.419
Me and my team just got
deputized by your husband,

05:32.462 --> 05:33.507
hunting some rip-off crew.

05:33.550 --> 05:34.856
What are you talking about?

05:34.899 --> 05:36.988
Eric's detailed to guard
a federal judge.

05:37.032 --> 05:38.686
Not anymore he isn't.

05:38.729 --> 05:41.906
I'm standing here
looking right at him.

05:41.950 --> 05:43.952
Did you mention me to him?

05:43.995 --> 05:46.868
No. What I do and who I see
is none of his business anymore.

05:46.911 --> 05:48.652
And he's moved on.
Got his new girl.

05:48.696 --> 05:50.306
Nia, I know a lot of guys
who think they're entitled

05:50.350 --> 05:52.134
to a wife and a girlfriend.

05:52.177 --> 05:54.658
Maybe it's a coincidence.
He doesn't know about you.

05:54.702 --> 05:56.225
He's a U.S. Marshal

05:56.268 --> 05:57.966
with access
to wiretap equipment.

05:58.009 --> 06:00.534
He can hack your phone,
read your texts, you know that.

06:00.577 --> 06:03.754
No. He wouldn't abuse
his clearance like that.

06:03.798 --> 06:05.669
Jeopardize his job?

06:05.713 --> 06:08.759
Come on now, Nia.
I'm a cop and you're a D.A.

06:08.803 --> 06:11.675
We've both seen domestic
situations turn real ugly.

06:11.719 --> 06:14.548
Some jealous dude going after
his ex or the guy she's dating.

06:14.591 --> 06:20.118
Look, it doesn't sound
like Eric, but be careful.

06:20.162 --> 06:21.337
I'll make some calls.

06:23.644 --> 06:25.254
You ready?

06:27.778 --> 06:29.258
Let's do it.

06:29.301 --> 06:31.216
â™ª

07:06.164 --> 07:08.428
You got zero video surveillance
from last night?

07:08.471 --> 07:10.995
This yard's got five
square miles of track

07:11.039 --> 07:13.041
with a thousand freight cars
moving through every day.

07:13.084 --> 07:15.043
What about the access gate
into the yard?

07:15.086 --> 07:16.348
It's got to have cameras, no?

07:16.392 --> 07:18.481
They were spray-painted over.

07:18.525 --> 07:20.744
And the torch they were packing
sliced right through the locks.

07:20.788 --> 07:22.790
Billy was here, though.
Swears he got a look at them.

07:22.833 --> 07:23.921
Billy's a guard here?

07:23.965 --> 07:25.967
GUARD:
Oh, no. He's a hobo.

07:26.010 --> 07:28.622
Nice kid.Can't believe hobos
are still a thing.

07:28.665 --> 07:30.493
Long as there are trains,
there'll be guys who
want to ride them.

07:30.537 --> 07:33.148
Billy, tell these
gentlemen what you saw.

07:33.191 --> 07:36.586
BILLY:
It's awful, right?

07:36.630 --> 07:38.501
I mean, for a guard,
Barlow was good people.

07:38.545 --> 07:40.808
Whenever I rode through here, he
let me clean up in the bathroom.

07:40.851 --> 07:42.592
You get a look at the
crew who killed him?Yeah, kind of.

07:42.636 --> 07:44.507
This van almost ran me over.

07:44.551 --> 07:46.248
And I see these
guys get out

07:46.291 --> 07:47.554
and start grabbing
stuff off the boxcar.

07:47.597 --> 07:48.642
How many guys?

07:48.685 --> 07:50.295
BILLY: At least
four, maybe five?

07:50.339 --> 07:52.036
I don't know, it was dark,
so it was hard to see them.

07:52.080 --> 07:53.342
But, it, uh, it sounded
like they were

07:53.385 --> 07:55.475
speaking in Chinese or
Japanese or something.

07:55.518 --> 07:57.259
You remember
any specific words?

07:57.302 --> 07:59.609
They kept calling this
one dude, uh, "dai-lo."

07:59.653 --> 08:01.132
It means "boss"
in Cantonese.

08:01.176 --> 08:02.917
Yeah, it's also
Kwon's alias.

08:02.960 --> 08:06.137
Here. It's kind of blurry,
but I managed to snap one off.

08:08.313 --> 08:10.011
Make sure every
patrol car on the street

08:10.054 --> 08:12.187
has eyes out for this van.

08:19.934 --> 08:22.240
You know why
I requested you, Sergeant?

08:22.284 --> 08:24.547
Tell me.

08:24.591 --> 08:27.071
Your team has the highest
fugitive recovery rate in SWAT

08:27.115 --> 08:28.682
and I like to win.

08:28.725 --> 08:30.858
Is that right?Yeah, I checked out
your file.

08:30.901 --> 08:32.729
You spent your first
six years in patrol

08:32.773 --> 08:34.905
running and gunning in the 77th.

08:34.949 --> 08:37.429
Is South Central really
as tough as they say?

08:37.473 --> 08:38.909
We don't call it
South Central anymore.

08:38.953 --> 08:40.389
We call it South L.A.

08:40.432 --> 08:41.912
Oh, South L.A.

08:41.956 --> 08:43.784
I guess some marketing guy
just got a raise, huh?

08:43.827 --> 08:46.743
It's just like anywhere,
Wells, and it's home.

08:46.787 --> 08:48.702
Hey, local kid does good.

08:48.745 --> 08:50.573
I did all right.

08:50.617 --> 08:53.141
ERIC: Man, LAPD should put you
on the recruitment posters.

08:53.184 --> 08:55.012
I don't do this job
to get famous, man.

08:55.056 --> 08:56.405
ERIC:
Oh, hey, I hear you.

08:56.448 --> 08:58.886
I just hit 15 years
as a Marshal.

08:58.929 --> 09:01.584
I wake up every morning,
I still crave the chase.

09:01.628 --> 09:04.500
The problem is chasing
bad guys doesn't leave

09:04.544 --> 09:07.416
a whole lot of time
for your personal life.

09:07.459 --> 09:09.287
A lot of marriages suffer.

09:09.331 --> 09:11.855
I know mine did.

09:11.899 --> 09:13.248
TAN: Patrol just
found the cargo van

09:13.291 --> 09:15.250
abandoned under the 10 Freeway.

09:15.293 --> 09:18.253
VIN came back, stolen off a used
lot in Alhambra two days ago.

09:18.296 --> 09:19.994
Chinese gangs
like to move a lot

09:20.037 --> 09:22.213
of black market merchandise
through that part of town.

09:22.257 --> 09:24.520
I bet you that's where
Kwon put together his crew.

09:24.564 --> 09:26.000
Alhambra. Tan, that's your
neck of the woods, right?

09:26.043 --> 09:27.610
TAN:
Yeah, used to be.

09:27.654 --> 09:29.438
That's Deac. Says they got
a hit on the torch

09:29.481 --> 09:30.874
used on the freight car.

09:30.918 --> 09:32.572
All right, almost home.

09:34.922 --> 09:37.446
Got connections to the gear
this crew used on the boxcar?

09:37.489 --> 09:38.926
Yeah, it matches equipment

09:38.969 --> 09:40.710
stolen from a local
trade school.

09:40.754 --> 09:42.538
There's hundred-pound cylinders
of oxy and acetylene.

09:42.582 --> 09:45.280
Four of them, along with some
regulators, 50 feet of hoses

09:45.323 --> 09:46.586
and a top-of-the-line
torch guard.

09:46.629 --> 09:48.152
DEACON: School sent us
a list of former students,

09:48.196 --> 09:51.765
all Chinese, who either
dropped out or were kicked out.

09:51.808 --> 09:53.636
Ran their names, but nothing
popped up except for one:

09:53.680 --> 09:55.899
Alec Chan.
Got arrests for DUI,

09:55.943 --> 09:57.814
unlawful discharge of firearm,
possession of stolen property.

09:57.858 --> 09:59.207
No way.

09:59.250 --> 10:01.252
What, you know him?

10:01.296 --> 10:02.253
Grew up three blocks
from each other.

10:02.297 --> 10:03.733
Went to high school
together.

10:03.777 --> 10:05.039
I still run into him once in
a while when I visit my mom.

10:05.082 --> 10:06.780
DEACON:
Well, he was charged

10:06.823 --> 10:08.738
with selling stolen goods
to the Viet Valley Mobsters.

10:08.782 --> 10:10.479
They're a Vietnamese gang
who move a lot of pills

10:10.522 --> 10:12.133
in the San Gabriel Valley area.

10:12.176 --> 10:13.482
Yeah, but based
on his priors,

10:13.525 --> 10:15.658
Chan sounds like a
paper gangster to me.

10:15.702 --> 10:17.529
You really think
that your old pal

10:17.573 --> 10:20.097
would hook up
with a bad boy like Kwon?

10:20.141 --> 10:21.490
It's hard to say.
I moved away from Alhambra

10:21.533 --> 10:22.839
as soon as I turned 18.

10:22.883 --> 10:24.536
You still got ties out there?Yeah, my uncle.

10:24.580 --> 10:26.103
He's head of the SoCal
Chinese American Business Club.

10:26.147 --> 10:27.670
Not much happens in Alhambra

10:27.714 --> 10:29.672
or the SGV without
him knowing about it.

10:29.716 --> 10:31.674
All right. Luca, go with Tan.

10:31.718 --> 10:33.676
Hit him up.
See if he's heard anything.

10:33.720 --> 10:35.547
Okay, let's go.

10:35.591 --> 10:38.115
Pull up Chan's intel.
Run his license plates.

10:38.159 --> 10:39.377
Send a BOLO out to patrol.

10:39.421 --> 10:41.118
I want eyes on this guy.

10:47.647 --> 10:49.692
You know, if you want
to talk to my mom,

10:49.736 --> 10:51.912
she left for work already.

10:51.955 --> 10:54.958
She's been doing
real good at her job.

10:55.002 --> 10:56.960
On time, every day.

10:57.004 --> 10:58.832
I do unannounced home visits
occasionally.

10:58.875 --> 11:00.703
It gives me a better sense
of how new parolees

11:00.747 --> 11:03.227
are dealing with life
on the outside.

11:03.271 --> 11:05.273
You want some coffee?
It'd just take a sec.

11:05.316 --> 11:07.884
Hmm. No. Thanks.

11:10.800 --> 11:12.715
Those are mine.

11:12.759 --> 11:15.979
Um, my buddy,
he came to watch the Lakers,

11:16.023 --> 11:17.894
brought a six-pack.

11:17.938 --> 11:20.331
We drank a few,
I made him take the rest home.

11:20.375 --> 11:23.857
Remember, as a condition
of Karen's release, she can't...

11:23.900 --> 11:25.728
No alcohol or drugs,
unless she has a prescription.

11:25.772 --> 11:27.817
Totally got it.

11:27.861 --> 11:30.254
You can check.
There's none in the house.

11:30.298 --> 11:31.778
Okay. Gonna need
to see the bedroom.

11:33.910 --> 11:36.521
I've seen worse.

11:36.565 --> 11:38.654
Yeah.I know you think I'm a hard-ass,

11:38.698 --> 11:41.048
looking to push
your mom back,

11:41.091 --> 11:43.790
but all I really want

11:43.833 --> 11:45.922
is for my parolees
to get their lives on track.

11:45.966 --> 11:48.882
If you notice your mom having
any adjustment issues,

11:48.925 --> 11:50.797
let me know.

11:50.840 --> 11:52.407
Will do.

11:52.450 --> 11:53.930
I'll get out of your hair.Sure.

11:53.974 --> 11:55.627
I'll see you next week.

11:55.671 --> 11:57.325
STREET:
Yeah.

12:01.068 --> 12:03.984
I'll make sure to have some
coffee ready for you next time.

12:04.027 --> 12:05.986
[door closes]

12:06.029 --> 12:07.944
[sighs]

12:11.469 --> 12:13.776
TAN:
He's not my uncle by blood.

12:13.820 --> 12:14.995
He and my dad were
from the same village.

12:15.038 --> 12:16.997
Came to the States together.

12:17.040 --> 12:19.347
Well, when my dad died, Yang
looked out for my mom and me.

12:19.390 --> 12:20.914
Made sure we always
had food on the table.

12:20.957 --> 12:22.785
So he's like a godfather.

12:22.829 --> 12:24.569
Yeah, but in China,
a respected man with connections

12:24.613 --> 12:26.354
is called "uncle."

12:26.397 --> 12:28.138
Did you bring your girl
Bonnie to meet him yet?

12:28.182 --> 12:29.531
No chance.
She is way too blonde.

12:29.574 --> 12:30.793
Ha!

12:30.837 --> 12:32.055
I don't visit Uncle
that often.

12:32.099 --> 12:34.144
We kind of lost touch
over the years.

12:34.188 --> 12:35.842
I bet he's proud
that you got SWAT.

12:44.676 --> 12:46.853
YANG:
Victor.

12:46.896 --> 12:48.158
It's been too long.

12:48.202 --> 12:50.030
Sorry, work keeps me busy.

12:50.073 --> 12:52.467
I barely have time to visit
Mom. Uh, this is Luca.

12:52.510 --> 12:54.991
He's one of my SWAT
teammates. One of the
best officers in Metro.

12:55.035 --> 12:57.733
Nah, listen, I'm okay.
But this guy here, he's top dog.

12:57.777 --> 12:59.735
Can't count the times
he's had my back.

12:59.779 --> 13:01.476
We're lucky
to have him in SWAT.

13:19.624 --> 13:20.887
Um, is everything okay?

13:20.930 --> 13:23.193
YANG: [scoffs]
My apologies, Officer.

13:23.237 --> 13:25.543
I forget my manners.

13:25.587 --> 13:27.589
You're not here
on a personal call.

13:27.632 --> 13:29.547
So how may I help you?

13:29.591 --> 13:32.115
We're looking for this guy
from Florida named Shen Kwon.

13:32.159 --> 13:33.987
Might be involved in a murder
and robbery. So far, all signs

13:34.030 --> 13:35.292
point to him operating
out of Alhambra

13:35.336 --> 13:36.728
and the San Gabriel Valley.

13:36.772 --> 13:38.600
Never heard of him.
If I learn anything,

13:38.643 --> 13:39.993
I'll be sure to call.

13:40.036 --> 13:41.429
How about Alec Chen?

13:41.472 --> 13:45.650
Alec? Is he suspected
of something?

13:45.694 --> 13:47.304
We think he's mixed up
with Kwon,

13:47.348 --> 13:48.566
stealing shipments of drugs.

13:48.610 --> 13:50.742
No, I just saw Alec
a few days ago.

13:50.786 --> 13:52.527
He's been working
with his mother,

13:52.570 --> 13:55.182
learning the family business,
so he can run it one day.

13:55.225 --> 13:58.228
Uncle, come on. You know Alec's
been in trouble in the past.

13:58.272 --> 13:59.577
He's from a good family.

13:59.621 --> 14:01.318
Victor, let me speak
with him first.

14:01.362 --> 14:02.711
The warrant's
already been issued

14:02.754 --> 14:04.234
for his mom's dress shop.

14:04.278 --> 14:06.280
I came here as a
courtesy to tell you

14:06.323 --> 14:07.368
face-to-face, to
see if you could help.

14:10.458 --> 14:12.416
Well, I cannot.

14:12.460 --> 14:14.027
[phone beeps]

14:14.070 --> 14:17.160
Well, if that changes,
please let us know.

14:19.467 --> 14:21.817
On the street,
these go for 60 a pill.

14:21.861 --> 14:22.818
We're asking 20.

14:27.127 --> 14:29.912
Blast it out,
you make half a mil.

14:29.956 --> 14:31.827
HONDO:
Metro SWAT!

14:31.871 --> 14:33.524
ERIC: U.S. Marshals!
Hands in the air!

14:33.568 --> 14:36.136
LUCA:
LAPD SWAT! Hands up, now!

14:36.179 --> 14:37.398
HONDO:
Deacon, you're up!

14:40.792 --> 14:42.272
Going hands on.

14:42.316 --> 14:45.145
LUCA:
Hands behind! You, down!

14:45.188 --> 14:46.450
Hey, little rabbit,
where you going?

14:47.669 --> 14:49.062
[zip tie tightens]

14:49.105 --> 14:51.673
Alec Chan,
you're under arrest for larceny,

14:51.716 --> 14:53.066
possession with intent to sell,

14:53.109 --> 14:56.112
and first-degree murder.

15:06.166 --> 15:07.471
Check this out.

15:09.517 --> 15:11.823
Well, it's good to see
him getting settled in.

15:11.867 --> 15:14.652
CHRIS:
I knew Street was volunteering
in the armory in his free time,

15:14.696 --> 15:17.568
I just had no idea it'd be
all of his free time.

15:25.315 --> 15:26.751
Look, I told you,
I'm just the middleman.

15:26.795 --> 15:28.579
A friend came to me
with those pills,

15:28.623 --> 15:31.539
said if I could sell them,
I'd get 20%.

15:31.582 --> 15:33.497
Victor, come on,
you know me, man.

15:33.541 --> 15:34.585
The Alec I know
came from a good home,

15:34.629 --> 15:35.673
mowed his neighbors' lawns,

15:35.717 --> 15:36.979
loved going to the Dodger games.

15:37.023 --> 15:38.633
What the hell happened?

15:38.676 --> 15:40.591
I followed my dreams, like you.

15:40.635 --> 15:43.072
Started deejaying some parties
up in the Hollywood Hills.

15:43.116 --> 15:46.293
They wanted some pills.
It was easy money.

15:46.336 --> 15:47.381
And now you're rolling
with a crew

15:47.424 --> 15:48.512
that killed a security guard,

15:48.556 --> 15:50.514
sells opiates to
street gangs.

15:50.558 --> 15:51.907
Sounds like you're
trending down, Alec.

15:51.951 --> 15:53.387
How low you
plan on getting?

16:03.049 --> 16:05.747
And why would I give you
a Get Out of Jail Free
card even if I could?

16:05.790 --> 16:07.053
Huh? So, you can sell drugs
to kids in our neighborhood?

16:09.359 --> 16:10.795
ERIC: And this
friend of yours.

16:10.839 --> 16:12.580
What's his name again?

16:12.623 --> 16:14.364
Joey.
I don't know his last name.

16:14.408 --> 16:16.540
ERIC:
And Joey No-Last-Name

16:16.584 --> 16:18.803
got all those pills
from where?

16:18.847 --> 16:20.370
Said he got it
from some guy in Riverside

16:20.414 --> 16:21.806
who found it in a landfill.

16:21.850 --> 16:24.157
HONDO: Right. Some
dude in Riverside

16:24.200 --> 16:25.593
was dumping his trash,
and he just happened

16:25.636 --> 16:26.942
to trip over $2 million in oxy.

16:26.986 --> 16:28.465
Yeah.

16:28.509 --> 16:30.902
Congratulations, my man,

16:30.946 --> 16:33.166
but you've just
won first prize

16:33.209 --> 16:36.256
for the stupidest story anyone's
ever tried to tell in this room.

16:38.258 --> 16:41.348
Look, I know dealing drugs
was dumb.

16:41.391 --> 16:43.959
But I didn't kill anybody.

16:46.135 --> 16:47.963
All Chan's calls went
to dead-end burners,

16:48.007 --> 16:50.444
but we found this:
a GPS tracking app.

16:50.487 --> 16:52.228
Yeah, for 20 bucks,
you can buy these, uh,

16:52.272 --> 16:54.970
chip-sized GPS responders,
stick them to whatever.

16:55.014 --> 16:57.451
Chan likes sticking
them to boxcars.

16:57.494 --> 16:59.148
That's the freight car Kwon
and his crew hit last night.

16:59.192 --> 17:00.802
And that's

17:00.845 --> 17:03.500
the PSD Rail Yard, 20 minutes
south in the City of Industry.

17:03.544 --> 17:04.719
Kwon's next target.

17:19.647 --> 17:21.431
HONDO:
This is LAPD SWAT!

17:21.475 --> 17:23.868
All of you, face down on
the ground, hands on your head!

17:23.912 --> 17:24.869
Gun!

17:27.568 --> 17:28.221
Don't let them scatter!

17:33.095 --> 17:34.444
[train horn honking]

17:34.488 --> 17:35.663
Train! Watch your six!

17:37.491 --> 17:39.145
[speaking Cantonese]

17:41.234 --> 17:42.974
[horn blaring]

17:43.018 --> 17:45.020
HONDO:
Where's our backup?

17:45.064 --> 17:47.066
We need them on
the other side of the tracks.

17:47.109 --> 17:48.110
They said they're about
five minutes out.

17:48.154 --> 17:49.894
LUCA: You got to
be kidding me.

17:49.938 --> 17:50.895
Oh, man.

17:50.939 --> 17:53.463
ERIC:
Train, one;

17:53.507 --> 17:55.509
bad guy, zero.

17:58.207 --> 17:59.861
HONDO: All right,
so what'd you find out?

17:59.904 --> 18:02.342
NIA: The Marshal's office
told me Eric

18:02.385 --> 18:03.865
switched assignments
two days ago.

18:03.908 --> 18:05.127
He specifically asked
for a case close to home.

18:05.171 --> 18:07.173
And you still think
that's a coincidence?

18:07.216 --> 18:08.435
I don't know what to think.

18:08.478 --> 18:10.219
But he respects law enforcement.

18:10.263 --> 18:12.482
He'd respect anyone in SWAT.

18:12.526 --> 18:14.658
Not if it's someone he thinks
is competition for his wife.

18:14.702 --> 18:15.920
He knows our marriage is over.

18:15.964 --> 18:17.183
Yeah, I hear you.

18:17.226 --> 18:19.054
So what the hell
kind of game is he playing?

18:19.098 --> 18:21.361
And why is he dragging me
and my team into it?

18:30.761 --> 18:32.415
[door opens]

18:32.546 --> 18:33.460
[drops keys]

18:35.201 --> 18:37.681
Hey.

18:37.725 --> 18:40.336
I didn't expect you home.

18:40.380 --> 18:44.166
Oh, I left early,
hoping to see you.

18:46.299 --> 18:48.518
[exhales]

18:48.562 --> 18:51.391
I'm getting good
at this whole online thing.

18:51.434 --> 18:56.004
I found a recipe
for gluten-free pasta.

18:56.047 --> 18:57.048
And before I went to prison,

18:57.092 --> 18:58.354
I didn't even know
what gluten was,

18:58.398 --> 19:00.530
let alone how bad
it is for you,

19:00.574 --> 19:02.358
but...

19:02.402 --> 19:04.099
Your parole officer stopped by.

19:05.405 --> 19:08.756
It was a random spot-check.

19:08.799 --> 19:10.453
[scoffs]:
All these silly rules, you know?

19:10.497 --> 19:12.629
Reports and phone calls
and visits

19:12.673 --> 19:14.979
and... h-honey, I'm s...

19:17.373 --> 19:19.070
What is that?

19:22.813 --> 19:24.772
That was in your room.

19:24.815 --> 19:26.817
[scoffs]

19:30.908 --> 19:33.389
Oh, wait, it's Trevor's.

19:33.433 --> 19:35.304
Trevor. Who's Trevor?

19:35.348 --> 19:37.785
He's this guy that I've been
spending time with.

19:37.828 --> 19:40.004
You know,
he's in NA, and, uh,

19:40.048 --> 19:41.397
you know, he was
doing really good,

19:41.441 --> 19:43.399
and he even got
three months sober,

19:43.443 --> 19:46.228
but he relapsed
last week, and...

19:46.272 --> 19:49.449
So y-you've been bringing
this guy here,

19:49.492 --> 19:51.277
while I've been at work,
without telling me?

19:51.320 --> 19:53.801
Hey, we're all adults here.

19:53.844 --> 19:56.282
Dating again is, you know,

19:56.325 --> 19:59.850
difficult enough without sharing
all the details with my son.

19:59.894 --> 20:03.114
But I swear to you,
from right now on, uh,

20:03.158 --> 20:04.594
Trevor and I are done.

20:04.638 --> 20:06.379
It is over.

20:06.422 --> 20:09.817
So that isn't yours,
and you're not using?

20:09.860 --> 20:12.298
Jimmy, do you think
that I would be that stupid?

20:12.341 --> 20:14.430
That I would risk
going back to prison?

20:14.474 --> 20:16.606
I see it all the time,
people violating their parole.

20:16.650 --> 20:19.174
Well, not me.

20:19.218 --> 20:21.872
So you wouldn't have a problem
submitting to a drug test?

20:21.916 --> 20:23.265
Yeah-- I passed a drug test
to get my job.

20:23.309 --> 20:25.049
That was months ago.
What about now?

20:25.093 --> 20:26.790
Okay.

20:26.834 --> 20:28.270
I see.

20:28.314 --> 20:30.620
Go ahead, you just
think the worst of me,

20:30.664 --> 20:32.274
because that's
what you always do.

20:32.318 --> 20:34.189
What's in your purse?What?

20:35.799 --> 20:37.627
If you got nothing to hide,
show me.

20:37.671 --> 20:39.586
No. It's...
[scoffs] It's my pur...

20:39.629 --> 20:40.804
Jimmy. Jimmy.

20:44.982 --> 20:45.940
[shouts]

20:45.983 --> 20:48.421
What's that?

20:48.464 --> 20:50.336
Okay. Look, so...

20:50.379 --> 20:52.294
What's that?!It's been hard for me.

20:52.338 --> 20:55.515
I-- everything's so different
since I came back from prison.

20:55.558 --> 20:57.734
How are you even getting
the money to buy this?

20:57.778 --> 21:02.565
Every single person that I trust
told me-- they warned me--

21:02.609 --> 21:05.046
that one day, you were gonna
drag me down with you.

21:05.089 --> 21:06.656
I would never do that to you.

21:06.700 --> 21:08.658
What do you mean, you'd
never do that to me?!

21:08.702 --> 21:12.053
If your parole officer had found
that before I did, I'd be fired.

21:13.837 --> 21:16.100
I chose you over SWAT.

21:20.235 --> 21:23.238
But you only care
about yourself.

21:23.282 --> 21:25.371
Don't you dare say that.

21:25.414 --> 21:29.549
I did 17 years for you.

21:29.592 --> 21:32.595
Your father was a monster,
and he would've killed us both.

21:32.639 --> 21:34.684
And-and I saved--
I saved your life,

21:34.728 --> 21:36.512
and this is how
you treat me now?

21:36.556 --> 21:38.297
You made me a part of
my own father's murder.

21:40.690 --> 21:44.128
I mean, yeah, he was a monster,
but you kept him around us,

21:44.172 --> 21:46.696
until the day that you
made me help you kill him.

21:46.740 --> 21:48.045
I mean, what does that make you?

21:50.831 --> 21:54.182
I'm done. I'm done. [sighs]

21:54.225 --> 21:56.140
What?

21:56.184 --> 21:58.055
I'm done carrying around any
more of this guilt about you.

21:58.099 --> 21:59.579
That's for groceries.

21:59.622 --> 22:02.625
I'm gonna keep paying rent
so you got a place to stay.

22:02.669 --> 22:05.106
Wait, wait, wait! Wait,
Jimmy, where are you going?

22:05.149 --> 22:07.369
I can't-- I can't have you
in my life anymore.

22:07.413 --> 22:08.762
Wha...?

22:08.805 --> 22:11.678
Not if I'm gonna straighten out,
get back on SWAT.

22:11.721 --> 22:13.941
Jimmy, I love you.

22:28.303 --> 22:31.524
SWAT responded to more than
a thousand calls last year.

22:31.567 --> 22:33.656
Captain, I'm not here
for a sales pitch.

22:33.700 --> 22:35.354
I'm here to see
a revised budget.

22:35.397 --> 22:37.443
And so far the only
cuts you've shown me

22:37.486 --> 22:39.053
are protein bars
and paper clips.

22:39.096 --> 22:42.622
Overtime. Without it, many
of the cases SWAT handles

22:42.665 --> 22:45.189
would never get addressed.And why is that?

22:45.233 --> 22:47.061
Because SWAT isn't nine-to-five.

22:47.104 --> 22:50.281
We're constantly training,
assisting federal task forces,

22:50.325 --> 22:52.806
and expected to react
no matter what time of day.

22:52.849 --> 22:54.198
But you've thought
of something?

22:54.242 --> 22:56.157
If we cap overtime across
the board, we'll cut 13%.

22:56.200 --> 22:59.595
That's not 15.Oh, it's awfully close.

22:59.639 --> 23:02.772
Let's come to a compromise here
and still keep the city safe.

23:02.816 --> 23:05.775
It's not lost on me

23:05.819 --> 23:08.387
you're trying your best
to avoid cuts to personnel.

23:08.430 --> 23:11.390
From the numbers you've shown
me, four officers will do.

23:11.433 --> 23:13.304
You want us

23:13.348 --> 23:16.046
to downgrade four current
members of SWAT to patrol?

23:16.090 --> 23:17.178
JESSICA:
You don't understand.

23:17.221 --> 23:20.050
Officers spend years
trying to make SWAT.

23:20.094 --> 23:23.184
It's one thing to demote someone
for bad performance,

23:23.227 --> 23:25.186
but these officers
are all-stars.

23:25.229 --> 23:27.318
You don't just ship them
back to the minors.

23:27.362 --> 23:29.843
That's why I said four, and
not the six you really need

23:29.886 --> 23:31.105
to balance the budget.

23:31.148 --> 23:32.106
I'm trying to compromise.

23:32.149 --> 23:35.326
HICKS:
Three.

23:35.370 --> 23:38.068
Done. But you don't
get to pick a recruit

23:38.112 --> 23:39.505
from this year's SWAT Academy.

23:39.548 --> 23:41.898
[scoffs]
When hell freezes over.

23:41.942 --> 23:43.378
Every year

23:43.422 --> 23:45.424
since 1967,

23:45.467 --> 23:47.382
SWAT has brought up
at least one recruit

23:47.426 --> 23:49.166
to carry on our tradition.

23:49.210 --> 23:50.907
GWEN:
Send four officers
down to patrol,

23:50.951 --> 23:53.127
hit my 15%,

23:53.170 --> 23:54.737
and I'll make sure
you get to pick one recruit

23:54.781 --> 23:55.695
from the Academy.

23:57.087 --> 23:58.132
Deal?

24:02.179 --> 24:04.660
Deal.

24:11.058 --> 24:13.713
You know how much shame
this is causing his family?

24:13.756 --> 24:15.628
That's on him, not me.

24:15.671 --> 24:17.020
You like putting away
your own people?

24:17.064 --> 24:19.762
I put away criminals,
Chinese or not.

24:21.068 --> 24:23.244
Uncle, please.
Alec's family looks up to you.

24:23.287 --> 24:26.290
If you tell him that he can save
face by helping us, he'll talk.

24:26.334 --> 24:27.944
But time is running out.

24:27.988 --> 24:29.772
If he helps us catch Kwon,
I will speak to the D.A.

24:29.816 --> 24:31.295
about a reduced sentence.

24:37.737 --> 24:41.610
[speaks Cantonese]
I didn't kill anyone.

24:41.654 --> 24:45.658
I believe you, but unless you
help the police catch this man,

24:45.701 --> 24:48.399
you'll be punished
for his sins.

24:48.443 --> 24:51.881
You have only one chance
to help yourself.

24:51.925 --> 24:54.667
I've known your mother
for 50 years.

24:54.710 --> 24:56.756
She doesn't deserve this.

25:00.586 --> 25:03.850
[sighs] Kwon promised
nobody would get hurt.

25:03.893 --> 25:05.242
Where can we find him?I don't know.

25:05.286 --> 25:07.549
He moves hotels every day
to be safe.

25:07.593 --> 25:09.116
You know what rail yard
Kwon's gonna hit next?

25:09.159 --> 25:11.292
I'm sure as soon as he
found out I was arrested,

25:11.335 --> 25:12.336
he bought a new list.

25:12.380 --> 25:13.642
List? What do you mean?

25:13.686 --> 25:16.079
The shipping manager
down at the ports,

25:16.123 --> 25:19.082
he's the one selling Kwon
info on the freight cars.

25:19.126 --> 25:20.170
Well, tell us you know his name.

25:31.138 --> 25:32.748
Got a couple unis sitting
on Cho's location,

25:32.792 --> 25:35.011
and my team will be ready
to roll in five.

25:35.055 --> 25:36.839
Oh, great.
Let's hope he can tell us

25:36.883 --> 25:37.840
what Kwon's next target is then.

25:42.149 --> 25:45.282
Listen, before we head out,

25:45.326 --> 25:47.458
I want to get something
straight right now.

25:47.502 --> 25:50.157
Sure, what's up?

25:50.200 --> 25:51.767
I know why you're
here, Wells.

25:51.811 --> 25:53.943
Yeah, I got a fugitive

25:53.987 --> 25:55.554
that needs scratching off
the Most Wanted list.

25:55.597 --> 25:58.426
Cut the act, man.

25:58.469 --> 26:00.210
You don't give a
damn about Kwon.

26:00.254 --> 26:02.082
You just used him
to get to me.

26:02.125 --> 26:04.650
What the hell are you
talking about?

26:04.693 --> 26:06.956
Man up.

26:07.000 --> 26:08.915
Just admit that you are
here because of Nia.

26:10.525 --> 26:13.441
You went and cooked up
some crazy-ass scheme

26:13.484 --> 26:14.877
so you could try to control
who's in her life,

26:14.921 --> 26:15.748
or something like that.

26:20.274 --> 26:24.452
Hmm. [chuckles]

26:27.237 --> 26:28.630
You two must have had

26:28.674 --> 26:30.589
some interesting phone calls
today, huh?

26:34.375 --> 26:38.553
Nia... she's got
some tells.

26:38.597 --> 26:42.992
I knew she had
something new going on.

26:43.036 --> 26:45.691
I dropped by her hotel.

26:45.734 --> 26:49.869
It took me a few hours, but then
I saw her leaving with you.

26:49.912 --> 26:52.959
I got to say, man,
I'm surprised.

26:53.002 --> 26:55.701
'Cause after me, Nia said she'd
never hook up with another cop,

26:55.744 --> 26:58.660
let alone a SWAT guy.[scoffs]

26:58.704 --> 27:01.707
Do you know how far out
of policy you are,
pulling this stunt?

27:01.750 --> 27:03.709
You're just a rebound to her.
You know that, right?

27:03.752 --> 27:06.581
See, the thing is, Wells,
Nia and I, we know what it is.

27:06.625 --> 27:08.931
I'm just the guy she's using

27:08.975 --> 27:11.194
to get from you to the guy
that she's eventually
gonna end up with.

27:11.238 --> 27:12.935
And we're both good with it.

27:12.979 --> 27:15.634
Just because she
drafted up the papers

27:15.677 --> 27:17.244
does not mean
that it is over.

27:17.287 --> 27:19.812
How 'bout your new
girlfriend? Hmm?

27:19.855 --> 27:23.337
She know you're
stalking your ex?

27:25.469 --> 27:27.428
So what now, hmm?

27:27.471 --> 27:28.995
You gonna go to your
commander and tell him

27:29.038 --> 27:32.302
we're fighting over a girl?No, I'm not.

27:32.346 --> 27:34.783
No, we're gonna go get Kwon
and we're gonna close this case.

27:34.827 --> 27:36.176
But if you ever
come near me again

27:36.219 --> 27:39.005
or threaten Nia in any way,

27:39.048 --> 27:40.310
you're gonna wish you didn't.

27:44.445 --> 27:46.621
Then I suggest we get
rolling, Sergeant.

27:51.060 --> 27:53.106
[indistinct chatter]

27:59.112 --> 28:01.723
TAN: Come on now, big man,
against the wall.

28:01.767 --> 28:03.682
DEACON: Everybody stay cool.
We're not Vice.

28:03.725 --> 28:04.813
This is not a raid.

28:04.857 --> 28:07.642
HONDO: We're not looking
to stop the fun.

28:07.686 --> 28:09.122
We're just looking
for Aaron Cho.

28:17.826 --> 28:19.741
Hear you like betting
college ball,

28:19.785 --> 28:21.438
and dug yourself a hole
for 30 grand

28:21.482 --> 28:22.657
with Big Rosie.

28:22.701 --> 28:25.268
You-you know Rosie?Who doesn't?

28:25.312 --> 28:27.227
We know a lot of folks
who lay bets with her.

28:27.270 --> 28:29.533
Rosie told me you just stopped
by her place and squared
what you owed.

28:29.577 --> 28:31.057
Hmm. With luck like this,

28:31.100 --> 28:33.494
I can understand why

28:33.537 --> 28:34.756
you're selling
freight car manifests

28:34.800 --> 28:36.062
to escaped killers.

28:36.105 --> 28:38.020
When was the last time
you saw Kwon?

28:38.064 --> 28:40.806
Uh... couple hours ago.

28:40.849 --> 28:43.634
Uh, he gave me 20 grand

28:43.678 --> 28:44.940
for a list

28:44.984 --> 28:46.637
of 50 containers
coming in tonight.

28:46.681 --> 28:48.465
Well, I'm gonna need
that list, smart guy.

28:48.509 --> 28:50.729
I don't have it.
I e-mailed it to him.

28:53.644 --> 28:55.516
I'm gonna need you
to forward it to me.

29:00.608 --> 29:03.219
We confiscated the oxy
on Kwon's first train robbery.

29:03.263 --> 29:04.525
We crashed his Vicodin party,

29:04.568 --> 29:06.222
and now he's down two men
on his crew.

29:06.266 --> 29:07.789
And he's out
a fat chunk of front money

29:07.833 --> 29:09.573
after buying the shipping
container numbers from Cho.

29:09.617 --> 29:11.358
ERIC: Right, so now
he's desperate.

29:11.401 --> 29:13.186
But he knows the rail
yards are too hot,

29:13.229 --> 29:14.796
so he's got to change tactics.

29:14.840 --> 29:16.798
You guys get pings
on those boxes yet?

29:16.842 --> 29:18.931
Yeah, all 50 containers were
brought into the city by train,

29:18.974 --> 29:20.802
then transferred on flatbeds

29:20.846 --> 29:22.848
heading to cities
all over the country.So what's Kwon gonna do,

29:22.891 --> 29:24.980
skip trains and start
hijacking trucks?ERIC: Yeah, that'd be my guess.

29:25.024 --> 29:26.808
We just have to figure out

29:26.852 --> 29:28.984
which one of these big rigs
he's gonna take down.

29:29.028 --> 29:30.551
That's why I had Chris
make us a top five list.

29:30.594 --> 29:32.466
Top five what?
Pop songs?

29:33.859 --> 29:35.121
Top five containers

29:35.164 --> 29:36.687
carrying
the highest-priced cargo.

29:36.731 --> 29:39.865
Out of those, only one has
pharmaceutical drugs. This one.

29:39.908 --> 29:41.997
Scheduled to take off
for St. Louis tonight

29:42.041 --> 29:43.477
with $6 million in Percocet.

29:43.520 --> 29:46.393
Huh. Everyone who says SWAT's
just a bunch of jocks

29:46.436 --> 29:48.308
who only care how much they
bench is selling you guys short.

29:48.351 --> 29:49.570
That's nice work.

29:49.613 --> 29:52.225
We'll form a plan as we roll.
Let's move.

29:57.926 --> 29:59.798
JESSICA:
Any closer to catching Kwon?

29:59.841 --> 30:02.278
We're getting warmer.

30:02.322 --> 30:03.845
The budget meeting,
how'd it go?

30:03.889 --> 30:04.977
You don't want to know.

30:05.020 --> 30:07.066
Are we losing anybody?

30:08.502 --> 30:10.156
[sighs]
How many, Jess?

30:12.941 --> 30:14.769
Don't tell anyone yet.

30:22.124 --> 30:25.867
Hey, Deac. Listen, um...

30:25.911 --> 30:27.695
I got a strange,
paranoid request.

30:27.738 --> 30:29.436
I'm listening.

30:29.479 --> 30:30.698
The Marshal.

30:30.741 --> 30:32.526
Keep an eye on him
for me, all right?

30:32.569 --> 30:33.875
You know, I thought
I clocked something

30:33.919 --> 30:35.442
between you guys earlier.

30:35.485 --> 30:37.705
You got history? Bad
blood from an old case?

30:37.748 --> 30:40.664
I'll fill you in later.
It's probably nothing.

30:40.708 --> 30:42.928
Just... watch my six
out there.

30:42.971 --> 30:44.059
Roger that.

30:59.248 --> 31:03.122
Took out the pallets of
Percocet, did everything
else you asked.

31:03.165 --> 31:04.775
There she is.

31:04.819 --> 31:07.126
You sure you can
handle this beast?

31:07.169 --> 31:09.519
Don't insult me.
[laughs]

31:09.563 --> 31:11.695
All right, so like
we talked about.

31:11.739 --> 31:13.132
Take the scenic route
to the freeway,

31:13.175 --> 31:15.134
then use surface streets
east of San Pedro.

31:15.177 --> 31:17.658
It's an industrial area,
so no pedestrians.

31:17.701 --> 31:19.442
Keep it under 30,
hit every red light.

31:19.486 --> 31:21.488
We got eyes on you at
all times, so don't worry.

31:21.531 --> 31:23.229
He look worried
to you, Deac?

31:23.272 --> 31:25.709
Hey. You're missing something.

31:25.753 --> 31:28.974
What's that?"Get in, sit down
and shut up."

31:29.017 --> 31:30.932
Perfect.

31:30.976 --> 31:33.543
[Luca chuckles]

31:33.587 --> 31:37.808
[groans]
All right.

31:37.852 --> 31:39.375
Don't tell Black Betty
about this.

31:39.419 --> 31:41.900
She gets jealous when I take
other girls out for a spin.

31:52.388 --> 31:56.175
All right. 20 David,
all clear on my one.

31:56.218 --> 31:59.395
How's my three side looking?Clear for now.
Just keep cruising.

31:59.439 --> 32:01.528
Let Kwon take the bait.Roger that, Hondo.

32:01.571 --> 32:03.225
Hey, 30 David, you copy?

32:03.269 --> 32:04.835
DEACON:
22 David, copy.

32:04.879 --> 32:06.707
Just waiting for you
to say when.

32:19.459 --> 32:21.678
[horn honking]

32:21.722 --> 32:24.725
20 David, game on.

32:24.768 --> 32:26.422
Okay, we got three suspects
armed with AKs.

32:26.466 --> 32:27.641
Open up!

32:27.684 --> 32:28.511
I don't think so, bro.

32:34.474 --> 32:35.388
Coming up on
your left, Luca.

32:38.739 --> 32:39.696
[tires screeching]

32:48.488 --> 32:50.185
20 David to Command.

32:50.229 --> 32:51.534
We're taking rounds.
Shots fired.

33:00.369 --> 33:02.110
This is 20 David. Suspect
headed east on San Pedro.

33:09.639 --> 33:11.641
[grunts]

33:11.685 --> 33:13.469
24 David to Command,
one suspect down.

33:13.513 --> 33:15.297
[shouting in Cantonese]

33:15.341 --> 33:18.126
[grunts][Taser buzzing]

33:18.170 --> 33:20.520
25 David to Command, second
suspect down; I'm code four.

33:20.563 --> 33:21.608
You and me got Kwon.
Let's go!

33:25.829 --> 33:28.136
I got left side.

33:28.180 --> 33:29.616
I go right.

33:36.797 --> 33:38.799
Hey, maybe we should spread out.

33:38.842 --> 33:40.192
HONDO:
No. No, we keep formation.

33:40.235 --> 33:42.585
This guy's got an AK-47
he's not afraid to use.

33:58.558 --> 34:00.603
You hear that?Go, go.

34:05.739 --> 34:07.654
Deac, what's your 20?

34:09.351 --> 34:11.266
Deac, what's your 20?

34:21.059 --> 34:23.539
Deac, do you read me?

34:23.583 --> 34:24.801
What's your 20?

34:24.845 --> 34:26.977
DEACON: 20 David,
had a comms malfunction.

34:27.021 --> 34:28.240
Coming up on your six.

34:28.283 --> 34:29.980
Roger. Deac,

34:30.024 --> 34:31.591
I got movement
at my 12 o'clock.

34:31.634 --> 34:32.809
I'm going right.

34:32.853 --> 34:33.767
DEACON: Roger that.
I'll meet you there.

34:35.508 --> 34:37.988
LAPD! Come out and
show me your hands.

34:41.514 --> 34:43.559
Did you see anyone
else out here?

35:06.016 --> 35:07.931
â™ª

35:28.082 --> 35:30.215
You good?

35:35.959 --> 35:37.483
This is 20 David
to Command.

35:37.526 --> 35:40.442
Last suspect down.

35:58.243 --> 36:00.593
It was a close shot.

36:00.636 --> 36:03.161
Yeah, I guess it was.

36:03.204 --> 36:05.206
I put in a lot of hours
at the range.

36:05.250 --> 36:09.167
Hey, you run a tight team.
I can see why SWAT gave you one.

36:13.867 --> 36:17.218
Thanks, for getting him before
he got a clean shot at me.

36:20.787 --> 36:22.615
Well, I guess we're done here.Mm-hmm.

36:22.658 --> 36:25.574
Yeah. Hey, Hondo.

36:27.272 --> 36:29.709
I still love her,

36:29.752 --> 36:32.538
and I want
another chance.

36:32.581 --> 36:34.888
And if you've ever been
in a similar situation, man,

36:34.931 --> 36:36.585
you can understand
where I'm coming from.

36:41.982 --> 36:44.637
I met a woman who was
finalizing a divorce.

36:44.680 --> 36:46.639
And her ex already
had a new girlfriend,

36:46.682 --> 36:49.424
so there wasn't supposed
to be any type of problem.

36:49.468 --> 36:50.817
Wells, you should've
come to me like a man,

36:50.860 --> 36:52.253
and we could've
talked it out, but no,

36:52.297 --> 36:53.907
you decided to
pull some strings

36:53.950 --> 36:56.083
so you could ride shotgun
and size me up.

36:58.607 --> 37:02.263
Okay, so I'm asking you
right now, man-to-man,

37:02.307 --> 37:03.830
stay out of my way.

37:03.873 --> 37:05.397
Give me a chance
to win her back.

37:05.440 --> 37:08.269
I'm not in your way.

37:08.313 --> 37:11.316
Whoever Nia wants to be with
is her call.

37:11.359 --> 37:14.362
And I take my cues
from Nia, not you.

37:16.712 --> 37:20.107
Hmm. [scoffs]

37:27.114 --> 37:28.898
Listen up.

37:28.942 --> 37:30.552
[chatter quiets]

37:30.596 --> 37:33.729
I know there have been rumors,

37:33.773 --> 37:35.165
and they're true.

37:35.209 --> 37:36.993
SWAT has been told
by the powers that be

37:37.037 --> 37:40.997
that we have to cut
our budget by 15%.

37:41.041 --> 37:43.435
We tried to cut
everything else we could,

37:43.478 --> 37:45.654
but we have to transfer
four members of SWAT

37:45.698 --> 37:46.960
back down to patrol.

37:47.003 --> 37:48.396
[all groaning]

37:48.440 --> 37:50.180
All right,
listen, listen. Hey!

37:50.224 --> 37:52.400
I know, it sucks,

37:52.444 --> 37:55.969
but remember,
patrol is important work,

37:56.012 --> 37:58.624
and you still represent
this city's finest.

37:58.667 --> 38:01.409
Patrol is a place where
you can make a difference.

38:04.369 --> 38:07.023
Effective immediately,

38:07.067 --> 38:09.983
these four officers
will transfer to patrol.

38:12.420 --> 38:13.769
DeAndre Sockwell.

38:13.813 --> 38:15.249
[all groaning]

38:15.293 --> 38:18.121
Griffin Blundell.

38:18.165 --> 38:19.949
Reynaldo Esquivel.

38:24.519 --> 38:27.087
Jeremy Tiller.

38:27.130 --> 38:29.655
Also, we're only allowed
to take in one new recruit

38:29.698 --> 38:30.917
into SWAT this year,

38:30.960 --> 38:34.355
so if you have friends
on the force who wanted

38:34.399 --> 38:37.924
to try out, let them know
this is not the year to do it.

38:37.967 --> 38:39.142
I'm sorry, guys.

38:57.987 --> 39:01.600
Hey. I don't know what
your uncle's got against you,

39:01.643 --> 39:03.602
but you're a
good cop, man.

39:03.645 --> 39:05.952
You know, I mean, you're
always squared away.

39:05.995 --> 39:07.257
You're one of the best dudes
that I've ever met.

39:07.301 --> 39:08.258
Thanks, man.

39:08.302 --> 39:09.564
You know, in China,

39:09.608 --> 39:11.436
police don't get the same
respect as they do here.

39:11.479 --> 39:12.611
People don't
look up to cops.

39:12.654 --> 39:15.831
It's like being a
garbage man of society.

39:15.875 --> 39:17.659
When I left Alhambra to join
the Police Academy,

39:17.703 --> 39:19.531
a lot of people thought
I was throwing my life away.

39:19.574 --> 39:22.098
They know you went to night
school and got your degree?

39:22.142 --> 39:24.449
Yeah, but my dad's dream
was for me to go to MIT,

39:24.492 --> 39:25.754
get a white-collar job,

39:25.798 --> 39:28.540
marry a Chinese girl,
spit out a bunch of kids.

39:28.583 --> 39:31.238
[laughs] I'm not gonna lie, man.
Getting into MIT is pretty cool.

39:31.281 --> 39:33.022
Eh, not to me.

39:33.066 --> 39:34.328
I didn't just want
to be some math nerd.

39:34.372 --> 39:36.069
I was good at it,
but it's not what I loved.

39:36.112 --> 39:38.245
Well, I'm glad
you made that call.

39:38.288 --> 39:39.768
I mean, the city can always
use more heroes.

39:42.684 --> 39:44.077
Uncle is right about one thing,

39:44.120 --> 39:46.035
I should go see
my mom more often.

39:46.079 --> 39:47.559
She's worried my job's
too dangerous.

39:47.602 --> 39:49.778
Prays to Buddha
to protect me.

39:49.822 --> 39:51.301
So what's your favorite spot
to take her?

39:51.345 --> 39:53.303
King Palace. Best seafood
in the city, hands down.

39:53.347 --> 39:54.696
All right, call her up,
man, have her meet us.

39:54.740 --> 39:56.785
I'm gonna treat you to dinner.
It's on me, buddy.

40:02.922 --> 40:04.184
Hey, Hondo.

40:04.227 --> 40:06.621
You got a minute?

40:06.665 --> 40:08.231
Sure, Street. What's up?

40:11.452 --> 40:12.453
Sorry, I was just,

40:12.497 --> 40:14.324
um...

40:14.368 --> 40:17.763
I... I just wanted...

40:22.507 --> 40:24.900
My mom's not living
with me anymore.

40:24.944 --> 40:25.901
I moved out.

40:27.773 --> 40:29.905
I mean, I-I told her that

40:29.949 --> 40:32.691
it's better if we're apart.

40:32.734 --> 40:35.781
That must've been hard for you.

40:35.824 --> 40:36.782
You okay?

40:41.787 --> 40:44.137
You were right all along.

40:44.180 --> 40:46.400
Just took me a little
longer to see it.

40:46.444 --> 40:49.098
Your mom didn't exactly
make it easy for you, kid.

40:51.666 --> 40:56.062
[sighs] I always wanted
to believe the best about her,

40:56.105 --> 40:59.631
and I think maybe
part of me resented you

40:59.674 --> 41:01.720
for seeing her
for who she really was

41:01.763 --> 41:03.330
and getting me to face up to it.

41:03.373 --> 41:05.506
Listen,

41:05.550 --> 41:10.424
I've been thinking
about this a lot,

41:10.468 --> 41:13.209
and I just want to say

41:13.253 --> 41:18.171
I'm really, really sorry

41:18.214 --> 41:20.782
for letting you
and the team down before.

41:20.826 --> 41:23.785
I know I got
growing up to do,

41:23.829 --> 41:26.396
but I am trying to do it.

41:26.440 --> 41:29.182
And I know I-I don't have
a chance of getting back on SWAT

41:29.225 --> 41:32.011
with these budget cuts,
but I hope

41:32.054 --> 41:34.883
that one day,

41:34.927 --> 41:37.146
I can become the kind of man
you wanted me to be.

41:40.106 --> 41:41.324
Street.

41:41.368 --> 41:43.109
Buck pulled strings

41:43.152 --> 41:45.633
to get you transferred here
from Long Beach,

41:45.677 --> 41:48.331
but you never actually made it
through LAPD SWAT Academy.

41:48.375 --> 41:49.855
But maybe, this time,

41:49.898 --> 41:52.379
you can do it right
and earn yourself a spot.

41:52.422 --> 41:55.556
Are you saying

41:55.600 --> 41:58.341
you'd-you'd give me a chance
of getting back on SWAT?

41:58.385 --> 42:00.692
I'm saying that I will get you
in SWAT Academy.

42:00.735 --> 42:02.955
You heard the captain.

42:02.998 --> 42:04.565
They're taking one
recruit this year.

42:04.609 --> 42:06.872
So what you got to do

42:06.915 --> 42:09.570
is ask yourself
how bad do you want it,

42:09.614 --> 42:11.485
and then go kick ass
and make sure it's you.

42:11.529 --> 42:15.054
I'll do my best.

42:15.097 --> 42:17.012
Yeah, I know.
