WEBVTT

00:09.853 --> 00:13.689
We need more water!

00:13.723 --> 00:15.557
- Hill, Flynn, Grant!
- Yes, sir?

00:15.592 --> 00:17.626
We got to get this under control.

00:17.660 --> 00:20.796
We got old, combustible
buildings in a tight space.

00:20.830 --> 00:22.598
Grant, you're with Hill.

00:22.632 --> 00:24.133
Where do you want us, chief?

00:24.167 --> 00:25.734
I need you guys to spread out inside.

00:25.769 --> 00:27.939
Knock it down as much
as you can, okay? Now, go!

00:29.239 --> 00:30.406
All right, listen,
I'll take the rear.

00:30.440 --> 00:32.307
- I got the roof.
- I'll take the front.

00:32.342 --> 00:34.843
Let's all go home.

00:40.850 --> 00:43.719
Let's go! Let's go!

01:20.557 --> 01:23.225
Come on, Jo. Pee.

01:23.259 --> 01:25.227
Hey, potty.

01:25.261 --> 01:26.728
You know what? Fine.

01:26.763 --> 01:28.597
Stay out here by yourself.
Fine.

01:28.631 --> 01:30.699
Oh, I'd hate to report you
for doggie abandonment.

01:34.437 --> 01:35.904
Hi.

01:35.939 --> 01:37.906
Hi.

01:37.941 --> 01:39.908
What are you doing here?

01:39.943 --> 01:42.811
I was, um...
In the neighborhood?

01:42.846 --> 01:46.381
Thank you.

01:50.320 --> 01:52.287
It's good to see you.

01:52.322 --> 01:53.655
More than good to see you.

01:53.690 --> 01:54.859
Mm.

01:57.594 --> 01:59.895
No, don't be nice to her.
Don't --

01:59.929 --> 02:02.164
Jo, you're not getting out of this.

02:02.198 --> 02:04.833
- What are you doing here? You on leave?
- No.

02:04.868 --> 02:08.770
I, uh... I asked
to be reassigned -- D.C.

02:08.805 --> 02:10.472
Ah, so no more foreign wars.

02:10.507 --> 02:12.474
For now.

02:12.509 --> 02:14.810
Is that... Bad?

02:14.844 --> 02:17.179
No. It's just --
it's just unexpected.

02:17.213 --> 02:19.548
Well, you probably
have to get to work.

02:19.582 --> 02:22.184
- So...
- What, you're going?

02:22.218 --> 02:24.520
Yeah. But I'm hoping to see you soon.

02:24.554 --> 02:27.289
What's the card say?

02:27.323 --> 02:28.790
Read it.

02:28.825 --> 02:30.325
Call me.

02:36.399 --> 02:37.833
Hello.

02:37.867 --> 02:39.946
Uh, Rizzoli.

02:40.989 --> 02:43.867

03:02.392 --> 03:05.127
Good morning.

03:05.161 --> 03:08.463
Damn it.

03:08.498 --> 03:11.466
That's an awful lot of trouble
for a cup of coffee.

03:11.501 --> 03:15.304
Well, my mother is
an espresso enthusiast.

03:15.338 --> 03:16.505
Yeah, it's the burden of being
a super taster.

03:16.539 --> 03:19.708
My mother is also a super smeller.

03:19.742 --> 03:21.276
I used patchouli oil once in college,

03:21.311 --> 03:22.844
and you said you could smell it on me

03:22.879 --> 03:24.813
- when I came home for Christmas.
- Oh, dreadful stuff.

03:24.847 --> 03:26.448
How did you sleep?

03:26.482 --> 03:27.649
Surprisingly well.

03:27.684 --> 03:29.217
Her father snores.

03:29.252 --> 03:32.421
Ohh. I don't miss that part
of marriage.

03:33.623 --> 03:35.290
Excuse me.
Thank you.

03:35.325 --> 03:37.759
Dr. Isles.

03:37.794 --> 03:40.629
All right. Okay.

03:40.663 --> 03:42.564
I'm sorry.
I have to go to work.

03:42.599 --> 03:45.167
A factory caught on fire
early this morning.

03:45.201 --> 03:46.301
Oh.

03:46.336 --> 03:47.803
We'll be fine.

03:47.837 --> 03:51.173
I make a mean eggs Benedict.

03:51.207 --> 03:53.675
Dean asked me to dinner.

03:53.710 --> 03:55.210
So go!

03:55.244 --> 03:56.511
What about Casey?

03:56.546 --> 03:59.214
I wonder if they know each other.

04:00.683 --> 04:02.384
Well, they were both in Afghanistan.

04:02.418 --> 04:03.685
Yeah, Maura,

04:03.720 --> 04:05.387
all 30,000 of them know each other.

04:05.421 --> 04:07.222
Well, Dean only went to Afghanistan

04:07.256 --> 04:09.124
because you said you wouldn't
read the Sunday paper

04:09.158 --> 04:10.459
in bed with him.

04:10.493 --> 04:12.794
I was not ready for that big
of a commitment.

04:12.829 --> 04:15.464
You're not even ready
for the commitment

04:15.498 --> 04:17.298
of calling him by his first name.

04:17.333 --> 04:19.301
It's Gabriel.

04:19.334 --> 04:21.168
"Gabriel." It's just --
it's so weird.

04:21.204 --> 04:23.271
It's so... Biblical.

04:26.209 --> 04:27.609
Firemen's formation.

04:27.644 --> 04:29.277
I <i>hate</i> it when they lose
one of their own.

04:29.312 --> 04:30.646
Sad.

04:36.619 --> 04:39.357
Order! Arms!

04:43.593 --> 04:45.661
- I'll check out the body.
- Okay.

04:45.695 --> 04:47.696
Arson squad's working it,

04:47.730 --> 04:49.698
but they're saying
it looked accidental.

04:49.732 --> 04:51.400
Faulty space heater started a fire.

04:51.434 --> 04:53.568
Hmm.
What do they make in here?

04:53.603 --> 04:54.803
Denim jeans.

04:54.837 --> 04:56.405
"Denim" jeans?

04:56.439 --> 04:59.608
As opposed to...
Green polyester jeans?

04:59.642 --> 05:01.076
See that guy?

05:01.110 --> 05:02.577
Old guy in the skinny jeans
and the shades?

05:02.612 --> 05:04.212
He's not that old.

05:04.247 --> 05:06.281
I busted him at least
three times in the '80s.

05:06.315 --> 05:08.550
Hmm.
Felony fashion crime?

05:08.584 --> 05:11.086
Would you two like a moment alone

05:11.120 --> 05:13.088
so you can fight?

05:13.122 --> 05:14.756
He borrows my unmarked,
and he brings it back empty!

05:14.791 --> 05:16.591
Hey, it had gas!

05:16.626 --> 05:18.493
Busted Whistler for cocaine.
Now he owns a jeans factory.

05:18.528 --> 05:20.195
Does he have any reason
to burn it down?

05:20.229 --> 05:21.863
Maybe.
Check it out, Frost.

05:21.983 --> 05:24.232
Sure. When you fill my tank back up.

05:24.267 --> 05:25.567
<i>With</i> super.

05:31.874 --> 05:36.111
His face shield is pitted.

05:36.145 --> 05:38.280
He wouldn't have needed
to take more than a few breaths

05:38.314 --> 05:39.648
before the smoke inhalation
killed him.

05:39.682 --> 05:42.517
It's a damn shame.

05:42.552 --> 05:43.852
I'm so sorry, chief.

05:43.886 --> 05:45.387
I sent him in there
without any backup.

05:45.421 --> 05:47.189
It's not your fault, Joe.

05:47.223 --> 05:50.358
We've been fighting these blazes
without enough people.

05:50.393 --> 05:52.627
That's what budget cuts will get you.

05:52.662 --> 05:55.697
This city's killing good men.

05:55.732 --> 05:57.299
Forced layoffs, station closing.

05:58.668 --> 06:00.769
Well, we can't do anything
about budget cuts,

06:00.803 --> 06:03.538
but let's make sure there was
nothing else at work here.

06:05.274 --> 06:07.542
I never understood guys
who wanted to run

06:07.577 --> 06:08.810
into burning buildings.

06:08.845 --> 06:11.546
You chase murderers.

06:11.581 --> 06:12.814
Not if they're on fire.

06:12.849 --> 06:15.083
Do you know why firefighters

06:15.118 --> 06:17.385
call their outfits "bunker gear"?

06:17.420 --> 06:19.221
Their "outfits"?

06:19.255 --> 06:22.557
Yes, because they keep their
outfits next to their bunks.

06:22.592 --> 06:24.359
Darn!

06:24.393 --> 06:25.794
Hey, did you know the first helmet

06:25.828 --> 06:27.662
was developed by luggage maker
Henry Gratacap?

06:27.697 --> 06:29.598
Does your brain ever get tired?

06:29.632 --> 06:31.399
No. Why?

06:31.434 --> 06:33.535
Well, just with all
the useless information --

06:33.569 --> 06:35.637
no?

06:35.671 --> 06:37.639
God, how hot does a fire have to be

06:37.673 --> 06:39.608
to melt the face shield?

06:39.642 --> 06:42.544
This can withstand heat
up to 500 degrees Fahrenheit.

06:42.578 --> 06:45.480
And he's got scorched gloves.

06:45.515 --> 06:46.681
If his gloves are scorched

06:46.716 --> 06:48.350
and his face shield is melted,

06:48.384 --> 06:50.752
shouldn't the rest of his body
be badly burned, as well?

06:50.787 --> 06:52.420
Not necessarily.

06:52.455 --> 06:55.323
The fire suit can withstand heat
up to 1,300 degrees.

06:55.358 --> 06:58.360
Huh.

06:58.394 --> 06:59.861
Pulmonary parenchymal damage

06:59.896 --> 07:04.166
consistent with inhaling air
above 265 degrees.

07:04.200 --> 07:07.235
Odd.

07:07.270 --> 07:08.570
What... Odd?

07:08.604 --> 07:10.739
He takes a breath or two, and boom --

07:10.773 --> 07:12.641
he's dead by smoke inhalation.

07:12.675 --> 07:14.643
The soot build-up
on the walls and windows --

07:14.677 --> 07:16.812
that's evidence of a low-oxygen fire.

07:16.846 --> 07:20.148
But his face shield and lungs
say it's a high-oxygen fire.

07:20.183 --> 07:21.516
I wrote about this once

07:21.551 --> 07:23.652
in the <i>journal
of combustible science.</i>

07:23.686 --> 07:27.355
Yes. It was a fabulous article.
I loved the photos.

07:27.390 --> 07:28.456
I'll print it up for you.

07:28.491 --> 07:30.325
Maura...
Why waste paper?

07:30.359 --> 07:32.394
I'll --I'll read it online.

07:32.428 --> 07:34.129
You're not gonna read it.

07:34.163 --> 07:35.630
No, probably not.

07:35.665 --> 07:38.066
But you <i>are</i> going to dinner
with Gabriel.

07:38.100 --> 07:40.335
How'd <i>you</i> know I was going to dinner?

07:40.369 --> 07:41.403
You brushed your teeth.

07:41.437 --> 07:42.571
I-I always...

07:42.605 --> 07:44.439
Brush my teeth...

07:44.473 --> 07:46.675
At work... Sometimes.

07:46.709 --> 07:48.343
I have a reservation
at the ivory table.

07:48.377 --> 07:49.411
I could call and make it r four.

07:49.445 --> 07:50.612
We could double-date.

07:50.646 --> 07:51.646
Really? Why?
Who's <i>your</i> date?

07:51.681 --> 07:53.381
My mother.

07:53.416 --> 07:57.085
Oh, so, you, me, Gabriel,
and your mother.

07:57.119 --> 07:58.787
Mm-hmm.
How can I say "no"?

07:58.821 --> 08:01.389
You're being sarcastic, aren't you?

08:01.424 --> 08:02.390
Very.

08:02.425 --> 08:03.692
If it was anyone <i>but</i> you,

08:03.726 --> 08:05.660
I'd say that's
the creepiest idea <i>ever.</i>

08:05.695 --> 08:08.997
The arson squad released
the space heater to my team.

08:09.031 --> 08:10.699
Hmm, did you just say the "a" word?

08:10.733 --> 08:13.735
- No. Yes.
- So you think it was arson?

08:13.769 --> 08:15.604
No. Yes.

08:15.638 --> 08:17.539
No. Anything?

08:17.573 --> 08:19.741
I think it's this heater
that was recalled in 1997,

08:19.775 --> 08:23.144
but it's covered in debris,
so I'm not sure.

08:23.179 --> 08:25.680
Fire can be a very clever opponent.

08:25.715 --> 08:27.215
Yeah.

08:27.250 --> 08:30.085
Take it apart.
Look for any anomalies.

08:31.721 --> 08:33.020
I've requested all
Boston fire department records

08:33.054 --> 08:35.155
for the last year.

08:35.191 --> 08:37.058
That's like 4,000 fires.

08:37.092 --> 08:40.662
4,082 building and structural fires.

08:40.696 --> 08:42.364
Well, if you're looking
at the incident reports

08:42.398 --> 08:44.566
for a possible pattern, then
you are thinking the "a" word

08:44.600 --> 08:46.268
and I need to let
the arson squad know.

08:46.302 --> 08:50.005
I think Gabriel
is a really good match for you.

08:50.039 --> 08:51.306
Nobody ask you, Yenta.

08:51.340 --> 08:53.141
Whistler,

08:53.175 --> 08:55.443
our old guy in the skinny jeans,
is a pervert.

08:55.478 --> 08:57.712
Okay, what would you like me
to do with this information?

08:57.747 --> 09:00.081
Check this out --
five different lawsuits.

09:00.116 --> 09:02.717
Women suing him right and left
for sexual harassment.

09:02.752 --> 09:06.254
Two seamstresses,
an accountant, a model, and...

09:06.289 --> 09:10.091
Really?
A cleaning woman.

09:10.126 --> 09:11.993
Strong libido. Apparently
it doesn't take him much

09:12.028 --> 09:13.428
to get interested.

09:13.462 --> 09:14.729
Apparently.

09:14.764 --> 09:16.698
Pretty expensive to fend off
five lawsuits.

09:16.732 --> 09:18.566
Yes, it is.

09:18.601 --> 09:20.235
Maybe Arnold burnt down
his only asset

09:20.269 --> 09:22.270
to collect the insurance money.
Let's go talk to him.

09:23.639 --> 09:26.207
Do you have an eye condition?

09:26.242 --> 09:28.176
- Excuse me?
- The sunglasses.

09:28.210 --> 09:30.512
It's safe to remove them.
Our lights are harmless.

09:30.546 --> 09:32.147
I've advised Mr. Whistler

09:32.181 --> 09:34.482
that this interview
is 100% voluntary.

09:34.517 --> 09:37.152
He's not required --
it's all right, hon.

09:37.186 --> 09:38.687
I've got nothing to hide
from these people.

09:38.721 --> 09:40.689
Did you just call your lawyer "hon"?

09:40.723 --> 09:42.457
Christie is my daughter.

09:42.491 --> 09:45.527
She's Harvard law, right, hon?

09:45.561 --> 09:48.163
I handle all matters pertaining
to Arnold Whistler denim.

09:48.197 --> 09:50.765
Then you're handling all the sexual
harassment claims against your father?

09:50.800 --> 09:53.568
Nuisance lawsuits.

09:53.602 --> 09:56.104
It's a bunch of angry single women.

09:56.138 --> 09:58.373
Those are a lot of angry "hons,"
Mr. Whistler.

09:58.407 --> 10:00.675
Those fat bitches
are suing me for being nice?

10:00.710 --> 10:02.177
Tell them I'm gonna sue them

10:02.211 --> 10:04.012
for leaving their space heaters on.

10:04.046 --> 10:05.313
<i>I'm</i> the victim.

10:05.348 --> 10:08.183
My business is destroyed.
What about <i>me?</i>

10:08.217 --> 10:09.384
What about the firefighter who died

10:09.418 --> 10:10.719
trying to save your factory?

10:10.753 --> 10:13.021
Well, those are the breaks.
It's his job --

10:13.055 --> 10:14.689
- hey, dad --
- hon, don't interrupt me.

10:14.724 --> 10:16.658
Listen to me, Mr. Whistler.

10:16.692 --> 10:19.127
We're going to dig into
your life, and if we find out

10:19.161 --> 10:20.695
that you had anything to do
with setting that fire,

10:20.730 --> 10:22.998
you're gonna wish you
were on the inside sewing jeans

10:23.032 --> 10:24.332
when it went up.

10:24.367 --> 10:27.035
I don't appreciate your tone,
detective.

10:27.069 --> 10:28.336
Me, neither.

10:28.371 --> 10:29.704
Come on, hon.

10:40.182 --> 10:42.150
Your father never lets me
eat garlic -- never!

10:42.184 --> 10:43.718
I'm so glad you liked it.

10:43.753 --> 10:46.087
It's delightful just
being able to see you.

10:46.122 --> 10:47.722
I wish we'd done this more.

10:47.757 --> 10:50.425
- Come to see me?
- Me too.

10:50.459 --> 10:52.427
No. It's... I-I wish...

10:52.461 --> 10:54.429
You wish what?

10:54.463 --> 10:58.299
I wish that I had stopped being busy

10:58.334 --> 11:02.037
and...
Just enjoyed you.

11:02.071 --> 11:04.639
Stop, mom, it's okay.

11:04.673 --> 11:06.641
No. It's not.

11:06.675 --> 11:11.179
It's really true
that your life gets lived

11:11.213 --> 11:13.648
while you are doing other things.

11:13.682 --> 11:16.084
Come on.
Come on, let's go home.

11:16.118 --> 11:17.385
Let's have some tea.

11:17.420 --> 11:19.387
You know me.
Tea's not gonna do it.

11:44.413 --> 11:46.381
Mom!

11:46.415 --> 11:48.483
Somebody, call an ambulance!

11:52.188 --> 11:54.489
Do something!

11:56.225 --> 11:58.693
Call 911!

12:20.938 --> 12:22.306
You look amazing.

12:22.340 --> 12:25.909
You look like you're
about to eat <i>here.</i>

12:25.943 --> 12:27.678
Hope that's okay.
No?

12:27.712 --> 12:30.380
No, it's okay. I just...

12:30.415 --> 12:31.782
I feel silly.

12:31.816 --> 12:33.650
I'm a little overdressed
for take-out.

12:33.685 --> 12:35.886
Don't.
I want to look at you.

12:35.920 --> 12:39.323
And I want you all to myself.

12:39.357 --> 12:41.725
You know what?
You can take me out.

12:41.759 --> 12:44.127
I'm not gonna run away
with the busboy.

12:46.130 --> 12:49.032
- What smells good? What'd you bring?
- Hey.

12:49.067 --> 12:51.368
Let's do this right.
Do you have some plates?

12:51.402 --> 12:54.237
Gosh, I usually just throw
the food on the counter.

12:55.673 --> 12:58.909
Okay, just... One sec.

13:00.278 --> 13:02.193
Hey, Maura. What's up?

13:11.789 --> 13:13.924
I'm so sorry.

13:13.958 --> 13:15.792
Are you okay?

13:15.827 --> 13:20.063
Contusions and scrapes.
I'm fine.

13:20.098 --> 13:21.365
Where's your mom?

13:21.399 --> 13:23.233
She's still in surgery.

13:23.267 --> 13:26.336
It's bad, Jane.

13:26.371 --> 13:28.638
They wouldn't let me
in the ambulance with her.

13:29.941 --> 13:32.042
He just drove into her,

13:32.076 --> 13:33.844
and then he left her.

13:33.878 --> 13:35.312
Oh, God.

13:42.286 --> 13:43.754
Um, uh, what can I do?

13:43.788 --> 13:47.224
Turn the clock back.

13:47.258 --> 13:50.260
Did you see the car?

13:50.294 --> 13:52.629
No.
It all happened so fast.

13:54.332 --> 13:56.767
I sound like all those people
that we see every day, don't I?

13:56.801 --> 13:58.034
It's okay.

13:58.069 --> 14:00.837
She pushed me out of the way, Jane.

14:00.872 --> 14:03.306
My mother saved my life.

14:04.742 --> 14:07.978
Oh. How is she?

14:08.012 --> 14:09.179
It was a severe
open book pelvic fracture,

14:09.213 --> 14:10.347
just like you thought.

14:10.381 --> 14:12.949
Okay. Uh, and how's the bleeding?

14:12.984 --> 14:14.785
We performed an anterior
pelvic open reduction

14:14.819 --> 14:16.052
and internal fixation.

14:16.087 --> 14:18.255
And the head and the cervical CTS?

14:18.289 --> 14:20.657
There's some cranial bleeding,

14:20.691 --> 14:23.660
but we're doing all
that we can, Dr. Isles.

14:23.694 --> 14:26.596
I know you are.
Thank you, doctor.

14:26.631 --> 14:30.066
You're welcome.
Just hold on.

14:30.101 --> 14:35.372
Oh, my God.
What if she dies?

14:35.406 --> 14:37.841
Oh, my God.

14:37.875 --> 14:40.377
Oh, my God.

14:43.181 --> 14:45.115
Oh, God.

14:45.149 --> 14:46.349
My father's in Tanzania.

14:46.384 --> 14:48.018
Even if I could reach him,

14:48.052 --> 14:50.120
it would take him two days
to get here.

14:50.154 --> 14:52.656
Maura, she's not gonna die.

14:52.690 --> 14:54.191
She's not.

14:55.760 --> 14:57.227
This is Frost.

14:57.261 --> 15:00.697
He's already working on
the hit-and-run re-enactment.

15:00.731 --> 15:02.732
- Go.
- No, no, no.

15:02.767 --> 15:06.036
Yes. Yes. Please.

15:06.070 --> 15:08.572
Go and do what you do
better than anyone I know.

15:08.606 --> 15:11.074
Find the bastard who did this.

15:11.108 --> 15:12.642
Please.

15:12.677 --> 15:14.344
Go.

15:23.821 --> 15:25.021
Who a <i>you</i> dressed as?

15:25.056 --> 15:26.857
A person. Shut up.

15:26.891 --> 15:28.024
Well, nice to see you, too.

15:28.059 --> 15:29.092
I think you look great.

15:29.126 --> 15:31.061
Thank you.

15:31.963 --> 15:34.297
Now, show me what you're gonna
show me, or I'm getting out.

15:34.332 --> 15:36.733
The hit-and-run driver came
from that direction.

15:36.767 --> 15:39.703
Minimum speed the vehicle was
traveling at the time of impact,

15:39.737 --> 15:41.071
40 miles per hour.

15:41.105 --> 15:42.672
Okay, you're just doing this
to show off your car.

15:42.707 --> 15:43.874
I could have read that in the report.

15:43.908 --> 15:45.742
Can you talk to detective Rizzoli?

15:45.776 --> 15:47.677
Because I can't.

15:47.712 --> 15:50.080
I asked Frankie to do
a hit-and-run work-up

15:50.114 --> 15:51.815
for the fatal-accident team

15:51.849 --> 15:53.083
to help him get into homicide faster.

15:53.117 --> 15:54.251
So you want to see what I found out,

15:54.285 --> 15:55.752
or you want to pick your toes?

15:55.786 --> 15:58.388
I'm not picking my toes.
My feet hurt.

15:58.422 --> 15:59.689
So don't wear dumb shoes.

15:59.724 --> 16:01.024
Show me!

16:06.063 --> 16:09.199
All right, yeah, so,
there are no skid marks

16:09.233 --> 16:11.134
prior to point of impact.

16:11.168 --> 16:13.670
So that means the driver
never applied the brakes.

16:13.704 --> 16:15.138
Well, maybe he didn't see them.

16:15.172 --> 16:17.140
Frankie's got a different theory.

16:17.174 --> 16:18.642
See those?

16:18.676 --> 16:21.645
Locked wheel skid marks.

16:21.679 --> 16:23.647
Those say that the driver stopped

16:23.681 --> 16:25.715
after he hit Constance.

16:25.750 --> 16:28.251
So he didn't just take off.

16:28.286 --> 16:29.819
But not because he had a conscience.

16:29.854 --> 16:31.087
Take a look at the back-up cam.

16:31.122 --> 16:32.989
He hit reverse.

16:42.366 --> 16:44.401
That's where Maura fell.
Right between those parked cars.

16:46.370 --> 16:49.906
Spin burn marks.

16:49.941 --> 16:53.710
This wasn't an accident.
He was <i>trying</i> to hit her.

17:01.152 --> 17:05.055
Don't scream, Maura.
Okay?

17:11.095 --> 17:14.164
What the hell are you doing here?

17:14.198 --> 17:15.799
I came as soon as I heard.

17:15.833 --> 17:17.901
- You came for <i>what?
- For her.</i>

17:17.935 --> 17:19.002
She's a good woman.

17:19.036 --> 17:20.904
What do you know about my mother?

17:20.938 --> 17:22.806
I'd like you to leave.

17:22.839 --> 17:24.907
Not until I know she's okay --

17:24.942 --> 17:26.675
and <i>you're</i> okay.

17:26.711 --> 17:29.012
You're here to knock heads?
You think that's gonna help?

17:29.046 --> 17:31.348
You'll see one day
when you have a child --

17:31.382 --> 17:34.117
Give it up.
You're a murderer.

17:34.151 --> 17:36.753
I'd rather not be reminded
that you fathered me. Go!

17:36.787 --> 17:37.988
Maura --

17:38.022 --> 17:39.155
I'm gonna scream
on the count of three.

17:39.190 --> 17:41.024
- One --
- look --

17:41.058 --> 17:44.194
I'll tell you who your mother is.

17:46.931 --> 17:49.165
That's my mother.

17:49.200 --> 17:51.101
You once asked me...

17:51.135 --> 17:54.404
<i>Don't</i> like to be toyed with. Two.

17:56.707 --> 17:58.775
I will tell you one day.

17:58.809 --> 18:00.176
When you're calm.

18:00.211 --> 18:02.579
Get out.

18:17.524 --> 18:19.450
Did he say why he came?

18:19.570 --> 18:21.404
Not really.

18:21.438 --> 18:23.806
But he seemed like he knew her.

18:23.841 --> 18:25.742
He knew Constance?

18:25.776 --> 18:30.613
He said he'd tell me
who my biological mother is.

18:30.648 --> 18:32.382
Do you <i>want</i> to know that?

18:36.520 --> 18:38.221
Well, he can't just keep

18:38.255 --> 18:39.556
popping in and out of your life
like this, okay, Maura?

18:39.590 --> 18:41.257
We'll get him.

18:41.292 --> 18:44.427
I don't know if I want you to.

18:44.461 --> 18:47.230
Well, it's not up to me.

18:47.264 --> 18:49.232
But you've got a more serious
problem right now, okay?

18:49.266 --> 18:52.101
Somebody tried to kill you.

18:52.136 --> 18:53.703
Skid marks can mean a lot of things.

18:53.737 --> 18:55.772
Someone tried to run you over.
All right?

18:55.806 --> 18:57.407
We've got to figure out who that is

18:57.441 --> 18:58.808
before they try it again.

18:58.842 --> 19:01.377
Jane, I have testified
in hundreds of murder trials.

19:01.412 --> 19:03.346
Any one of those men
and women convicted

19:03.380 --> 19:04.547
could want me dead.

19:07.585 --> 19:09.552
I put a uniform outside.
Do you want me to stay?

19:09.587 --> 19:12.088
No. No, just keep digging.

19:12.122 --> 19:13.856
I'll be okay.

19:15.292 --> 19:18.595
You know, I'll never tell you
that it'll be okay

19:18.629 --> 19:21.097
when I don't know that it will.

19:21.131 --> 19:25.101
But I am here for you.
Okay?

19:34.411 --> 19:37.380
So nice of you
to bring these for Jane.

19:37.414 --> 19:39.582
And I always wanted to try these.

19:39.617 --> 19:41.651
You'd look great in those --
dark-wash skinnies,

19:41.685 --> 19:43.186
our top seller.

19:43.220 --> 19:44.320
What size are you?
A four?

19:45.689 --> 19:48.291
I haven't been a size four since --

19:48.325 --> 19:50.693
since never.
Step away from the jeans, ma.

19:50.728 --> 19:53.363
I was too a size four.
How would <i>you</i> know?

19:53.397 --> 19:55.131
What's the matter with you?

19:55.165 --> 19:56.432
The person that you're flirting
with happens to be

19:56.467 --> 19:58.568
a suspect in a possible arson murder.

19:58.602 --> 20:00.536
What do you think -- that bribing my
mother is gonna clear your name?

20:00.571 --> 20:02.438
Listen, hon, you're tying up my money

20:02.473 --> 20:03.840
with that insurance company.

20:03.874 --> 20:05.842
You bet I am.
Take your jeans and go.

20:10.514 --> 20:11.748
Really?

20:13.584 --> 20:15.485
Crime lab found
microscopic traces

20:15.519 --> 20:16.886
of black isocyanate paint

20:16.920 --> 20:18.421
embedded in the broken watch crystal.

20:18.455 --> 20:19.889
It's automotive paint, Jane.

20:19.923 --> 20:21.424
Oh, really?
What makes you think that?

20:21.458 --> 20:22.859
Because she was hit by a car?

20:22.893 --> 20:24.394
Okay, how do I get you to talk to me

20:24.428 --> 20:26.329
like you talk to Frost?

20:26.363 --> 20:28.765
Well, don't state the obvious,
first of all, all right?

20:28.799 --> 20:31.200
Did you run it through
the automotive paint database?

20:31.235 --> 20:33.236
Yeah. Went back 30 years.
Didn't find a match.

20:33.270 --> 20:35.571
So we're thinking
custom paint job, maybe.

20:35.606 --> 20:37.907
Okay, see?
That's... Better.

20:37.941 --> 20:40.376
I mean, it's still kind
of obvious, but it's better.

20:40.411 --> 20:43.379
Could be an older car.
What's the next step, Frost?

20:43.414 --> 20:44.947
He's about to impress you.

20:44.982 --> 20:47.984
We sent it to
the Toronto forensic lab.

20:48.919 --> 20:50.887
Okay.
I'm impressed.

20:50.921 --> 20:52.955
Oh, it's the largest automotive
paint database in the world.

20:52.990 --> 20:54.957
Back to obvious.
Unimpressed.

20:54.992 --> 20:56.826
Dr. Isles' mom gonna make it?

20:56.860 --> 20:58.428
I hope so.

20:58.462 --> 21:00.396
Crime lab tech came by
to bring you some photos.

21:00.431 --> 21:02.498
Yeah, she was supposed to
take apart the space heater.

21:02.533 --> 21:04.434
They found all the components
but the thermal cut-off switch.

21:04.468 --> 21:06.569
What, you think
somebody tampered with it?

21:06.603 --> 21:09.272
Crime lab can't say till they
have Dr. Isles look at it.

21:09.306 --> 21:10.707
You really think we're looking
at an arson?

21:10.741 --> 21:12.408
Maybe.

21:12.443 --> 21:14.877
But I don't think
that Arnold Whistler

21:14.912 --> 21:16.312
stopped harassing women long enough

21:16.347 --> 21:17.714
to take a space heater apart.

21:17.748 --> 21:19.449
Maybe we should check out
those fire records

21:19.483 --> 21:21.284
that Maura was asking for,
see if there's a pattern.

21:21.318 --> 21:22.752
Will you check with arson and
see what is taking them so long?

21:22.786 --> 21:24.027
- Yeah, sure.
- Thanks.

21:26.890 --> 21:29.292
Okay, what I'm about to say
doesn't leave this room.

21:30.427 --> 21:31.761
Paddy Doyle's back in town.

21:31.795 --> 21:33.329
Oh, man.

21:33.364 --> 21:34.731
For payback.

21:34.765 --> 21:36.366
His daughter was a target
in a hit-and-run.

21:36.400 --> 21:39.802
And... I didn't put a BOLO out on him.

21:39.837 --> 21:41.504
Makes sense --

21:41.538 --> 21:44.607
let him watch her back until
we find out who's after her.

21:44.641 --> 21:46.342
She's the one person
we know he'll keep safe.

21:46.377 --> 21:47.643
Hell, Jane, for all we know,

21:47.678 --> 21:49.445
this all could be connected to Doyle.

21:49.480 --> 21:51.180
A rival trying to draw him out.

21:51.215 --> 21:53.282
I'll reach out to a southie
C.I., see what he knows.

21:53.317 --> 21:54.650
Okay.

21:54.685 --> 21:56.419
I mean, we got to put Doyle away
at some point.

21:56.453 --> 21:59.288
How's Maura gonna be with that?

21:59.323 --> 22:02.733
After all this, I hope relieved.

22:06.163 --> 22:08.297
Hi.

22:08.332 --> 22:09.665
Hi.

22:09.700 --> 22:11.667
Did you have a nice day?

22:11.702 --> 22:14.470
Oh, yeah.
It was great. You?

22:14.505 --> 22:17.507
Is Maura okay?

22:17.541 --> 22:19.842
No.

22:19.877 --> 22:22.712
Are <i>you</i> okay?

22:22.746 --> 22:24.463
Sort of.

22:26.917 --> 22:28.751
I came back for one reason.

22:28.786 --> 22:31.354
Why, you need someone to drink
a six-pack with you?

22:31.388 --> 22:33.389
Yeah. You.

22:36.860 --> 22:39.195
Um...

22:39.229 --> 22:41.697
Things might have gotten a little...

22:41.732 --> 22:43.199
Complicated.

22:44.301 --> 22:46.335
There may be someone else.

22:46.370 --> 22:47.637
I don't care.

22:47.671 --> 22:49.321
I'll take my chances.

22:50.641 --> 22:52.449
I came back for you.

23:13.630 --> 23:16.332
There was something on my cheek.

23:18.168 --> 23:20.136
Was it your hand?

23:21.672 --> 23:24.674
You got to lay off the boxing, lady.

23:24.708 --> 23:26.142
It's all right.
I should have asked.

23:26.176 --> 23:28.511
You don't have to ask.

23:34.785 --> 23:37.620
Mm. Oh, crap.

23:37.654 --> 23:39.388
- What?
- I got to go check on Maura.

23:39.423 --> 23:42.258
Anything I can do?

23:42.292 --> 23:44.427
Yeah, um, you can go away.

23:44.461 --> 23:47.763
You're very distracting.

23:47.798 --> 23:49.632
No, you know what?

23:49.666 --> 23:53.135
Um, actually...

23:53.170 --> 23:56.506
Actually, there <i>is</i> something
you can do for me.

23:56.540 --> 23:57.840
I don't really want to go away.

23:57.875 --> 23:59.408
No, come on.
No, it's not that.

24:00.511 --> 24:03.579
Can you just be Gabriel?

24:03.614 --> 24:05.281
Please.

24:05.315 --> 24:09.285
Oh, my God. You just said
my name. That's so weird.

24:09.319 --> 24:10.553
Come on.

24:10.587 --> 24:14.423
Just... Not be agent Dean.

24:14.458 --> 24:17.693
Can you do that for me, please?

24:17.728 --> 24:21.130
Yeah.

24:22.499 --> 24:25.501
Paddy Doyle is back in town.

24:26.603 --> 24:29.438
Patrick Doyle.

24:29.473 --> 24:32.108
You think the hit-and-run
is connected to him?

24:32.142 --> 24:33.709
Mm-hmm.

24:33.744 --> 24:35.378
I mean, if one of his enemies
wanted to get back at him,

24:35.412 --> 24:38.648
Maura's the perfect target.

24:40.684 --> 24:42.518
And things could get
a little ugly, huh?

24:42.553 --> 24:44.287
That's why you're telling me.

24:44.321 --> 24:47.323
Yeah.
How will I protect her?

24:49.793 --> 24:52.628
Paddy Doyle is one of the FBI's
most wanted fugitives.

24:52.663 --> 24:55.331
Oh, God. Okay.

24:55.365 --> 24:57.266
Well, I guess
we'll always have south Boston.

24:57.301 --> 24:58.568
So that's it?

24:58.602 --> 25:02.572
I... I pursue an organized crime boss,

25:02.606 --> 25:04.240
and you and I are --

25:04.274 --> 25:06.242
I don't know.
I don't know, Dean.

25:06.276 --> 25:08.578
But this always happens.

25:08.612 --> 25:11.280
Oh.

25:11.315 --> 25:14.483
I gave you my word I'd just be me.

25:16.153 --> 25:20.222
I won't do anything
until you tell me I can.

25:24.256 --> 25:28.633
I'm not leaving until you finish
those pancakes. I added quinoa.

25:28.668 --> 25:31.503
Dr. Oz says
they're very good for you.

25:31.537 --> 25:32.971
Mmm.

25:33.006 --> 25:34.373
Thank you.

25:34.407 --> 25:36.008
You're here.

25:36.042 --> 25:37.676
Her vitals stabilized.

25:37.710 --> 25:40.612
She's still critical,
but she's a little better.

25:40.646 --> 25:42.814
I really had to get back to work.

25:42.849 --> 25:44.683
Good.

25:44.717 --> 25:46.685
Hey, ma, can I have some pancakes?

25:46.719 --> 25:49.855
Yeah.
I-I tried a new recipe.

25:49.889 --> 25:51.456
How are they?

25:51.491 --> 25:53.592
Gritty.

25:53.626 --> 25:54.926
Yuck.

25:54.961 --> 25:57.929
"Yuck"?
What do I do with "yuck"?

25:57.964 --> 25:59.664
Do you have any macaroni and cheese?

25:59.699 --> 26:00.699
- For breakfast?
- Yeah.

26:00.733 --> 26:03.568
Dr. Oz would not approve.

26:03.603 --> 26:05.971
Mac and cheese
has a very high fat content,

26:06.005 --> 26:08.273
empty calories due to white flour.

26:08.307 --> 26:10.242
Do you have to ruin <i>everything?</i>

26:10.276 --> 26:11.910
Sorry.

26:11.944 --> 26:14.713
My mother would never let me eat
anything like that.

26:14.747 --> 26:16.214
Well, you were deprived.

26:16.249 --> 26:17.616
I used to think that kids

26:17.650 --> 26:20.285
who had bologna on white bread
were lucky.

26:20.319 --> 26:22.254
Turns out I was the lucky one.

26:22.288 --> 26:24.856
I used to think that kids
who had really big allowances

26:24.891 --> 26:27.225
and never had to go to church
were lucky.

26:27.260 --> 26:29.561
Turns out they were.

26:29.595 --> 26:31.897
That would probably be a lot better

26:31.931 --> 26:34.332
with some grated pecorino Romano.

26:34.367 --> 26:36.201
Yeah.
I got ketchup.

26:36.235 --> 26:38.870
Thanks, ma.

26:38.905 --> 26:41.873
Hey, Jane.
I got 'em.

26:41.908 --> 26:43.408
Hey. Maura.

26:43.443 --> 26:45.277
- You okay?
- Yeah.

26:45.311 --> 26:47.479
Thank you.

26:47.513 --> 26:48.814
Toronto lab found something.

26:48.848 --> 26:50.348
The transfer paint
on your mom's watch

26:50.383 --> 26:52.684
matched "black diamond"?

26:52.718 --> 26:55.620
That's an old paint used
on '70s police cruisers.

26:55.655 --> 26:56.888
That's encouraging.

26:56.923 --> 26:58.590
I mean, how many 40-year-old cars

26:58.624 --> 26:59.791
are still on the road?

26:59.826 --> 27:01.726
Can you take this upstairs to Frost?

27:01.761 --> 27:03.228
Tell him to put out a BOLO.

27:03.262 --> 27:05.330
We're looking for
a 1970s old Chevy impala.

27:05.364 --> 27:06.731
Copy that.

27:06.766 --> 27:08.266
Thanks.

27:08.301 --> 27:11.269
Okay. So, I have to
tell you something.

27:11.304 --> 27:14.739
I told agent Dean
that Paddy is back in town.

27:16.442 --> 27:19.277
Well, you have to do
what you have to do.

27:19.312 --> 27:22.614
Okay, but he's not gonna do
anything until I tell him to,

27:22.648 --> 27:28.520
because... I told <i>Gabriel
instead of agent Dean.</i>

27:28.554 --> 27:31.269
Thank you.

27:35.728 --> 27:38.396
Arson squad sent over
the fire incident reports.

27:38.431 --> 27:40.799
This isn't even
all of them, Jane.

27:40.833 --> 27:42.834
All right.
We'll divide them up.

27:44.270 --> 27:47.339
About 400 have already been
investigated by the arson squad.

27:47.373 --> 27:49.274
The rest were ruled accidental.

27:49.308 --> 27:52.377
Great.
That only leaves us 3,700.

27:52.411 --> 27:54.179
- They found the car!
- How do <i>you</i> know?

27:54.213 --> 27:55.280
Same model, same paint.

27:55.314 --> 27:56.882
Excellent.
Come on, let's go.

28:00.553 --> 28:02.854
Kind of reminds me
of the Blues Brothers car.

28:02.889 --> 28:04.389
W-who are the Blues Brothers?

28:04.423 --> 28:06.263
You did <i>not</i> just say that.

28:08.394 --> 28:10.262
No prints.
It's wiped clean.

28:10.296 --> 28:12.664
Do you recognize it?

28:12.698 --> 28:15.600
No. All I saw was the headlights
and the tail lights.

28:15.635 --> 28:18.770
All right.
Well, this is definitely hair.

28:18.804 --> 28:20.305
And this is blood.

28:22.508 --> 28:24.709
Maura, it's okay.
We got this. All right?

28:24.744 --> 28:26.344
I wanted to see it,

28:26.379 --> 28:27.512
I know it's just
an inanimate object. I just --

28:27.547 --> 28:29.848
- it's okay to be upset.
- No, come on.

28:29.882 --> 28:31.716
I can't cry at work.
It's unprofessional.

28:31.751 --> 28:33.785
I'm just gonna go to the hospital.

28:33.819 --> 28:35.620
I'm gonna have
a uniform follow you home.

28:35.655 --> 28:37.088
- Jane?
- Yeah.

28:37.123 --> 28:38.623
Transmission fluid.

28:38.658 --> 28:39.691
Nobody's driven <i>this for a while.</i>

28:39.725 --> 28:40.759
Yeah, there's a trail of it.

28:40.793 --> 28:42.727
Car must have broke down.

28:42.762 --> 28:44.429
That's why he left it here.

28:44.463 --> 28:46.431
No plates or tags, no VIN number.

28:46.465 --> 28:48.833
Vehicles made before 1981
just had an I.D. Tag.

28:48.868 --> 28:51.336
How we gonna trace it?
We can't without the tag.

28:51.370 --> 28:52.604
What is this?

28:52.638 --> 28:55.307
It's like a decal
or an emblem was here.

28:55.341 --> 28:57.242
Can you put some
fingerprint powder right there?

28:57.276 --> 28:59.244
Good idea.

28:59.278 --> 29:02.147
- Might stick to the adhesive there.
- Yeah.

29:04.617 --> 29:07.085
What was here?

29:07.119 --> 29:09.421
Uh, can you take
some pictures of this?

29:09.455 --> 29:12.190
- A lot of 'em.
- Got something.

29:12.225 --> 29:14.326
- What is that?
- A washer for something.

29:14.360 --> 29:17.095
There's a stain on the floor mat
on this side.

29:17.129 --> 29:18.430
Doesn't look like blood.

29:18.464 --> 29:20.131
Hey, could you collect the floor mat

29:20.166 --> 29:21.633
and swab it
before you take it to the lab?

29:23.336 --> 29:25.837
I think our bad guy was in a hurry.

29:32.612 --> 29:34.479
She's doing much better.

29:34.513 --> 29:37.449
It was nice meeting you, Mr. Isles.

29:44.757 --> 29:47.325
You told her you're my father?

29:47.360 --> 29:48.526
I said I'm your uncle.

29:48.561 --> 29:50.362
I wanted to keep an eye on your mom

29:50.396 --> 29:52.364
while you checked out the perp's car.

29:52.398 --> 29:55.400
How did you know that?

29:55.434 --> 29:58.603
I don't miss anything
if it relates to you.

30:15.321 --> 30:17.489
I never knew you were there.

30:22.328 --> 30:24.496
I wanted to be the kind of man

30:24.530 --> 30:27.198
who could be this little girl's dad.

30:27.233 --> 30:29.167
So why weren't you?

30:29.201 --> 30:31.469
I couldn't be anything
but what I was --

30:31.504 --> 30:33.605
a low-class thug from south Boston.

30:33.639 --> 30:38.476
My dad, my uncles,
hell, my grandfather --

30:38.511 --> 30:40.111
all Irish mob.

30:40.146 --> 30:44.316
And I grew up wanting to be
just like them.

30:44.350 --> 30:46.685
Until I met your mom.

30:48.421 --> 30:53.158
I mean your birth mom.

30:53.192 --> 30:56.094
She was so different, so... Special.

30:56.128 --> 31:00.432
I wanted to be good enough for her.

31:02.034 --> 31:04.336
Why did she give me up?

31:04.370 --> 31:07.205
She was only 18.

31:07.239 --> 31:10.008
She was brilliant, like you.

31:10.042 --> 31:13.678
What the hell did she see in you?

31:13.713 --> 31:19.217
You know how many times
I've asked myself that?

31:20.419 --> 31:23.021
Mom?

31:23.055 --> 31:24.389
Mom?

31:27.693 --> 31:29.561
Maura?

31:33.199 --> 31:35.500
What's happened?

31:35.534 --> 31:36.735
Mom, you've been in an accident.

31:36.769 --> 31:40.271
Somebody was here...

31:40.306 --> 31:42.340
Talking to me...

31:42.375 --> 31:44.676
Telling me...

31:44.710 --> 31:47.812
I must live for my daughter.

31:52.118 --> 31:54.786
Was it Patrick?

31:54.820 --> 31:56.621
Patrick?

32:09.068 --> 32:12.003
Hey.
What are you doing here?

32:12.037 --> 32:13.538
I'm distracting myself

32:13.572 --> 32:16.408
because if I don't fill my brain
with "useless" information,

32:16.442 --> 32:17.709
I start crying, okay?

32:17.743 --> 32:19.244
Okay.

32:19.278 --> 32:21.012
Uh, any idea what this is?

32:21.046 --> 32:22.280
Where'd you find it?

32:22.314 --> 32:24.315
I thought maybe one of
my techs misplaced it

32:24.350 --> 32:26.151
when they took the heater apart.

32:26.185 --> 32:27.485
How's that possible?
We just found it.

32:27.520 --> 32:29.220
No, this is the thermal cutoff switch

32:29.255 --> 32:31.089
from <i>this</i> space heater.

32:31.123 --> 32:32.557
For <i>this</i> space heat?

32:32.591 --> 32:35.059
Yes.
Where did you find it?

32:35.094 --> 32:36.528
In the car that hit your mother.

32:36.562 --> 32:38.329
What?

32:38.364 --> 32:40.098
- A-are you sure?
- Yeah.

32:40.132 --> 32:41.766
So whoever tried to kill you
in that car

32:41.801 --> 32:43.501
started the fire.

32:48.003 --> 32:51.121
- But why would I be a target?
- Think about the timeline, okay?

32:51.241 --> 32:53.452
The arson squad says
it's an accident.

32:53.486 --> 32:55.154
You ask to check the space heater.

32:55.188 --> 32:56.789
And then, next thing you know,

32:56.823 --> 32:58.924
a hit-and-run driver
is taking a shot at you.

32:58.959 --> 33:01.427
I have results on the stain
in the suspect's car.

33:01.461 --> 33:03.462
Thanks.

33:05.465 --> 33:10.302
Dextromethorphan,
guaifenesin, glycerol.

33:10.337 --> 33:12.004
Commonly referred to,

33:12.038 --> 33:14.073
for those of us with a PhD
in organic chemistry, as...?

33:14.107 --> 33:16.242
Cough syrup.

33:16.276 --> 33:18.444
Great.

33:20.313 --> 33:22.948
Low-oxygen fires don't burn
at a temperature

33:22.983 --> 33:25.050
necessary to do this to his gloves.

33:25.085 --> 33:28.087
I can't explain the damage
to his airway, either.

33:28.121 --> 33:29.788
Sorry, Dr. Isles,
but you said you wanted

33:29.823 --> 33:31.523
the gas chromatography results
when they were in.

33:31.558 --> 33:33.058
Thank you.

33:33.093 --> 33:34.827
This is the analysis
of the substances

33:34.861 --> 33:36.362
I found on Craig Hill's face shield.

33:37.864 --> 33:39.098
There's something here.

33:40.857 --> 33:42.368
Gas chromatography is used

33:42.402 --> 33:44.770
to separate and analyze compounds

33:44.804 --> 33:46.105
that can be vaporized.

33:46.139 --> 33:49.108
Could you say that in earthling?

33:49.142 --> 33:51.343
There are trace levels
of potassium permanganate

33:51.378 --> 33:52.745
on his face shield.

33:52.779 --> 33:54.146
Even more earthling.

33:54.180 --> 33:57.216
You see this?

33:57.250 --> 33:59.018
Cough syrup.

33:59.052 --> 34:00.419
We found traces of that in
the hit-and-run driver's car.

34:00.453 --> 34:03.422
Glycerol is the chief ingredient
in cough syrup.

34:03.456 --> 34:05.758
This is potassium permanganate.

34:05.792 --> 34:07.293
Watch this.

34:11.998 --> 34:14.800
Stand back.

34:18.804 --> 34:21.340
When glycerol is used
as an accelerant,

34:21.373 --> 34:24.976
potassium permanganate
becomes extremely combustible.

34:25.011 --> 34:26.812
No kidding.

34:26.846 --> 34:29.748
The outside edge
of Craig Hill's face shield

34:29.783 --> 34:30.949
was coated in it.

34:30.984 --> 34:32.318
And then glycerol was added.

34:32.351 --> 34:34.186
The cough syrup.

34:34.219 --> 34:36.188
So somebody must have thrown it
in his face.

34:36.222 --> 34:37.889
That's why his face shield melted.

34:37.924 --> 34:40.225
But what about his gloves?
Why'd they catch fire?

34:40.260 --> 34:41.893
Well, it's possible
the gloves ignited

34:41.928 --> 34:43.395
because they were coated, too.

34:43.429 --> 34:45.496
So he never had a chance.
Somebody <i>wanted</i> him dead.

34:45.532 --> 34:48.000
Somebody who was in the fire
with him.

34:50.303 --> 34:51.804
Maybe it was personal.

34:51.838 --> 34:54.306
Maybe.

34:54.341 --> 34:57.009
Bunch of white guys sued the
Boston fire department in 2001.

34:57.043 --> 34:58.243
Claimed that their
affirmative action hiring plan

34:58.278 --> 35:00.679
was discriminatory.

35:00.714 --> 35:01.880
Craig Hill was African American.

35:01.915 --> 35:03.882
Not bad for the old white guy.

35:03.917 --> 35:06.218
Now, <i>that's</i> harassment, Frost.

35:06.252 --> 35:07.853
What, the "old" part
or the "white" part?

35:10.056 --> 35:11.724
Find out if any of the firefighters

35:11.758 --> 35:13.826
from engine company 15
were part of that lawsuit

35:13.860 --> 35:15.194
before Korsak sues you, Frost.

35:18.798 --> 35:21.166
Here's the original complaint.
Yeah, Jim Grant.

35:21.201 --> 35:23.202
He <i>was</i> named.

35:23.236 --> 35:25.771
We talked to him.
He fought the Whistler fire with Craig Hill.

35:27.107 --> 35:29.408
How many times I got to tell
you? Check my damn alibi.

35:29.442 --> 35:31.377
We are.
And it's a good one, Jim.

35:31.411 --> 35:33.379
Consoling dead firefighter's wife.

35:33.413 --> 35:35.080
Ask her.

35:35.115 --> 35:36.415
You didn't like the fact
that Craig Hill

35:36.449 --> 35:37.950
had a lower test score,

35:37.984 --> 35:40.853
but he was hired before you, did you?

35:40.887 --> 35:42.021
No. Would <i>you?</i>

35:42.055 --> 35:43.756
No.

35:43.790 --> 35:45.157
Wasn't Craig's fault.

35:45.191 --> 35:47.326
Department changed its policy.

35:47.360 --> 35:50.095
My dad was a firefighter.
My granddad.

35:50.130 --> 35:52.097
And they're telling me "no"
because of the color of my skin?

35:53.400 --> 35:54.767
Alibi checks out.

35:54.801 --> 35:55.968
Craig Hill's widow said he was there

35:56.002 --> 35:57.369
at the time of the hit-and-run.

35:57.404 --> 35:59.071
Hit-and-run?

35:59.105 --> 36:01.106
I thought we were
talking about a fire.

36:01.141 --> 36:03.342
You can go now.

36:06.413 --> 36:10.382
Craig was a damn fine firefighter.

36:10.417 --> 36:13.685
We all miss him.

36:13.720 --> 36:16.388
We're sorry for your loss, man.

36:19.959 --> 36:22.428
This is what was on the back
of the hit-and-run car.

36:22.462 --> 36:24.129
One of these.

36:24.164 --> 36:26.832
That's a St. Florian cross.

36:26.866 --> 36:30.002
Boston firefighters union used
to hand these out in the '70s.

36:31.771 --> 36:33.038
Well, none of them are old enough.

36:33.073 --> 36:34.239
Maybe it was a legacy.

36:34.274 --> 36:36.075
Yeah, Jim grant said his dad
and granddad

36:36.109 --> 36:37.443
were Boston firefighters.

36:37.477 --> 36:39.211
One of them could have
given him the cross.

36:39.245 --> 36:40.846
No, grant's got an airtight alibi.

36:40.880 --> 36:43.148
It's got to be someone
from engine company 15.

36:43.183 --> 36:45.184
Well, we could interrogate <i>all</i> of them.

36:45.218 --> 36:47.219
No, you can't. There's not gonna
be any more interrogations.

36:47.253 --> 36:48.787
Grant complained to his union,

36:48.822 --> 36:51.190
and every firefighter
in the city is lawyered up.

36:51.224 --> 36:52.391
And they're pissed at us.

36:52.425 --> 36:54.960
- Well, that's not good.
- No, it's not.

36:54.994 --> 36:57.296
Oh, thanks.

36:57.330 --> 37:00.099
This is the last of
the arson squad's fire reports

37:00.133 --> 37:02.234
from last year.

37:02.268 --> 37:03.769
They're all from engine company 15 --

37:03.803 --> 37:05.051
where were they?

37:06.739 --> 37:10.776
That's weird.
Craig Hill had them checked out.

37:10.810 --> 37:12.211
Our victim?

37:12.245 --> 37:14.413
Craig Hill is looking into every fire

37:14.447 --> 37:17.216
that his company responded to
in the last year,

37:17.250 --> 37:18.784
and then he ends up dead?

37:18.818 --> 37:20.919
What the hell was he about to find?

37:20.954 --> 37:22.821
Carbon build-up, electrical fire,

37:22.856 --> 37:24.089
water heater explosion --

37:24.124 --> 37:25.824
all of these
were ruled as accidental.

37:25.859 --> 37:27.292
Happens all the time.

37:27.327 --> 37:29.128
Nothing I'm looking at
looks suspicious, either.

37:29.162 --> 37:31.797
Okay, but here's what's weird.

37:31.831 --> 37:34.133
All of these fires
started at 6:00 A.M. ...

37:34.167 --> 37:36.001
On a Tuesday in district 21.

37:36.035 --> 37:38.170
Does anybody know what's special
about Tuesday in that district?

37:38.204 --> 37:41.173
- Garbage day is all I can think of.
- Yeah.

37:41.207 --> 37:43.842
And the fires all began
at commercial businesses

37:43.877 --> 37:46.178
in the early morning
before garbage pick-up.

37:46.212 --> 37:48.413
Yeah. And what's a great source
of fuel for a fire?

37:48.448 --> 37:49.882
Garbage.

37:49.916 --> 37:51.750
So Craig Hill must have figured out

37:51.784 --> 37:54.253
that somebody was deliberately
setting fires in his district.

37:54.287 --> 37:57.022
Somebody that was good enough
to make them look accidental.

37:57.056 --> 37:59.791
So when I requested the files
to review them,

37:59.826 --> 38:01.193
I became the next target.

38:01.227 --> 38:02.794
So now what do we do?

38:02.829 --> 38:04.296
Well, our suspect is probably
a firefighter.

38:04.330 --> 38:06.298
We got to flush him out.

38:06.332 --> 38:08.800
- How?
- I might have an idea.

38:13.752 --> 38:15.012
Thank you.

38:15.132 --> 38:18.081
I'm sorry for this,
but as the medical examiner,

38:18.115 --> 38:19.582
I am entitled to collect
forensic evidence

38:19.617 --> 38:21.117
from city property.

38:21.151 --> 38:23.686
Anything else?
My men aren't too happy.

38:26.257 --> 38:29.058
I can see that.
And I'm sorry.

38:30.628 --> 38:33.296
There <i>is</i> something else.

38:33.330 --> 38:36.332
I'd like the plans
for the Whistler factory.

38:39.069 --> 38:41.371
More evidence collection?

38:41.405 --> 38:42.472
Yes.

38:44.241 --> 38:47.043
Look, I can't guarantee
the safety of that building.

38:47.077 --> 38:50.146
It's quite all right.
I know what I'm doing.

38:53.918 --> 38:55.418
Thank you.

39:25.951 --> 39:29.319
You looking for where Craig died?

39:29.353 --> 39:31.955
Yes.

39:34.224 --> 39:36.225
It's Kevin Flynn.

39:36.260 --> 39:39.128
We found him right about here.

39:42.092 --> 39:44.934
And my grandfather died
fighting the '72 Vendome fire.

39:44.969 --> 39:47.503
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

39:47.538 --> 39:49.138
City kept cutting back
and cutting back.

39:49.173 --> 39:50.373
How do you fight all these fires

39:50.407 --> 39:51.641
without enough firefighters, huh?

39:56.714 --> 39:58.181
You followed me?

40:01.485 --> 40:03.987
You shouldn't have come here
by yourself.

40:04.021 --> 40:06.022
- Why not?
- You know why not.

40:06.056 --> 40:08.024
I had to make sure people understand

40:08.058 --> 40:10.193
that they just can't keep
laying us off.

40:10.227 --> 40:12.595
How did you do that, Kevin?

40:12.630 --> 40:14.430
You know how.
I burned a few buildings.

40:14.465 --> 40:18.134
And then Craig started
digging around.

40:18.168 --> 40:20.069
Just like you.

40:21.538 --> 40:25.041
You both should have just
left it alone.

40:25.075 --> 40:27.276
Kevin, don't! Don't!

40:28.112 --> 40:29.612
Drop your weapon, Doyle!

40:29.647 --> 40:31.214
Gabriel, no!

40:31.248 --> 40:33.149
No!

40:36.320 --> 40:38.187
