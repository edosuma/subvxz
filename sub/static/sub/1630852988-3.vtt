A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

00:15.306 --> 00:19.227
<i>Dance isn't a life, Antonia.</i>
<i>It's a hobby, a whim.</i>

00:19.310 --> 00:21.688
You're an adult.
You have to think about your future.

KARINA
INCOMING CALL

00:51.051 --> 00:55.805
Hey, I was calling to see if you have
the money because, well, I need it.

00:58.016 --> 00:59.768
I'm out of the show.

01:00.602 --> 01:03.229
No show, no deal. No deal, no money.

01:04.022 --> 01:07.859
You can't come to me with this now.
What will I tell the girls?

01:09.903 --> 01:11.988
-I'm sorry.
-<i>Antonia.</i>

01:12.072 --> 01:13.239
<i>Antonia.</i>

01:30.131 --> 01:31.883
<i>-The number you have…</i>
-Karina.

01:32.842 --> 01:35.220
Devices should be stored in the lockers.

01:35.303 --> 01:37.430
-Something bad happened.
-No kidding.

01:38.556 --> 01:39.724
Yes, it's personal.

01:40.725 --> 01:41.559
Again?

01:41.643 --> 01:43.978
Look, Mr. Toño, I need to leave, okay?

01:45.355 --> 01:49.567
Karina, I'm sick of your excuses
and your personal problems.

01:50.485 --> 01:53.571
If you like, I can come tonight
or whatever you want.

01:56.574 --> 01:59.244
What exactly do you mean
by "whatever I want"?

02:00.370 --> 02:02.413
Because last time didn't go well.

02:03.790 --> 02:05.083
Let's make a deal.

02:06.584 --> 02:07.502
Go.

02:07.585 --> 02:09.170
Go and run your errands.

02:10.421 --> 02:11.464
But first,

02:13.174 --> 02:14.843
wait for me in the bathroom.

02:14.926 --> 02:18.513
Get that beautiful mouth ready
to give me a good blow job.

02:59.220 --> 03:02.056
So your shoes were taken from your hands.

03:02.140 --> 03:05.268
-Yes, but don't worry about it.
-No, Chama.

03:05.351 --> 03:08.438
It's not okay.
We were all supposed to look the same.

03:09.355 --> 03:13.151
-They're just shoes, Liliana.
-It's not just the shoes.

03:13.234 --> 03:17.864
Ximena prepared our look.
So we'd look good onstage.

03:18.865 --> 03:19.866
No.

03:20.658 --> 03:21.492
What happened?

03:22.035 --> 03:24.746
They've canceled
the plane tickets I reserved.

03:26.456 --> 03:29.417
If we don't buy them now
we'll have to travel by land.

03:36.549 --> 03:39.636
-What's up, girls? All good?
-Where have you been?

03:40.678 --> 03:42.013
Wasn't he here last night?

03:45.975 --> 03:46.976
Wait here.

03:51.231 --> 03:55.526
So you wake up with that girl here,
and you get up early to take her home.

04:00.490 --> 04:04.911
I guess you won her over like,
"I'm a bad boy, blah-blah-blah."

04:05.620 --> 04:07.997
If you already know, why are you asking?

04:10.792 --> 04:12.293
What are you playing at?

04:13.002 --> 04:14.003
Right.

04:15.004 --> 04:16.965
I love you with all my heart.

04:18.049 --> 04:21.052
But I don't have to give you explanations.

04:21.135 --> 04:24.264
Not to me. But give them to Ximena.

04:24.347 --> 04:26.516
For fuck's sake, man.

04:27.517 --> 04:33.106
How can I make you and everyone understand
that I don't owe anyone an explanation?

04:33.189 --> 04:35.900
And even less so to Ximena
because she's my ex.

04:37.026 --> 04:38.736
So make things clear to her.

04:38.820 --> 04:42.323
One day you sweeten her up,
and the next you cast her aside.

04:43.074 --> 04:45.576
I'd rather make things clear with you.

04:46.202 --> 04:51.332
Let's revise two important house rules,
so that we can live in harmony, okay?

04:52.375 --> 04:53.209
First,

04:54.210 --> 04:55.878
don't meddle in my business.

04:56.838 --> 04:57.672
And second,

04:58.298 --> 05:02.260
I won't meddle in yours.
That way we'll all be happy, dude.

05:02.343 --> 05:05.972
Look, girl, in this life
we have to grow up.

05:07.098 --> 05:10.143
Understand me?
I need you to grow up, sweetie.

05:12.020 --> 05:13.938
I'm going to shower. Love you.

05:54.562 --> 05:55.563
Good luck.

06:02.570 --> 06:03.571
Next.

06:07.784 --> 06:09.911
-Good afternoon.
-How can I help you?

06:09.994 --> 06:13.456
You sorted the papers
for my mom to go to Miami.

06:14.207 --> 06:15.375
Marta Sánchez.

06:18.503 --> 06:22.548
At the back there's a letter
that my mom sent me from work.

06:25.468 --> 06:31.808
She told me that it could be useful,
that it might make the process easier.

06:44.529 --> 06:46.155
None of this is useful.

06:47.657 --> 06:48.658
What?

06:49.951 --> 06:50.952
Let me explain.

06:52.161 --> 06:55.123
Our friends in North America
make things difficult.

06:55.665 --> 06:59.210
They'll go over anything I send them
with a magnifying glass.

07:00.169 --> 07:01.879
So what can I do?

07:02.380 --> 07:04.590
It's a more dangerous process.

07:05.174 --> 07:06.968
And more expensive, obviously.

07:07.635 --> 07:08.886
Very expensive?

07:12.598 --> 07:15.143
How badly do you want
to go to the US illegally?

07:16.519 --> 07:18.062
I have nothing here anymore.

07:20.440 --> 07:21.566
So very badly.

07:24.402 --> 07:27.363
-You're a shameless friend, Liliana.
-It's a loan.

07:27.447 --> 07:29.240
That you weren't even given.

07:29.323 --> 07:33.244
Karina has the money now. I return it,
and it's like it never happened.

07:33.744 --> 07:35.955
Don't we have to buy the tickets now?

07:36.038 --> 07:38.207
Yes, but they don't cost that much.

07:38.791 --> 07:40.209
We can buy other things.

07:41.627 --> 07:42.712
And Ximena?

07:43.296 --> 07:45.631
-She said to go.
-She's not coming?

07:45.715 --> 07:48.301
She couldn't cancel
her shifts at the salon.

07:48.384 --> 07:49.552
If that's true.

07:49.635 --> 07:50.845
Why wouldn't it be?

07:51.512 --> 07:53.181
She's been acting strange.

07:53.264 --> 07:57.185
Since the night at the bar,
she's been leaving the group high and dry.

07:57.268 --> 08:00.438
No, Liliana. She just has a lot of work.

08:00.521 --> 08:01.731
No way.

08:02.482 --> 08:04.525
This group should be her priority.

08:04.609 --> 08:08.196
If it paid, it would be. As it is,
she has to put up with her uncle.

08:12.116 --> 08:13.868
MATEO
WHEN CAN I GET YOU THAT BEER I OWE YOU?

08:13.951 --> 08:14.952
Who is it?

08:15.453 --> 08:16.954
-The preppie one.
-What?

08:17.497 --> 08:19.957
"When can I get you that beer I owe you?"

08:20.458 --> 08:25.546
BOMBITA
INCOMING CALL

08:25.630 --> 08:26.464
Hi.

08:27.048 --> 08:29.717
<i>Are you sure you can handle my voltage?</i>

08:29.800 --> 08:31.511
Electricity doesn't scare me.

08:33.513 --> 08:35.181
Well, you know where I live.

08:35.848 --> 08:36.807
Bye.

08:41.062 --> 08:45.441
<i>What was that, Liliana?</i>
<i>You're so cheeky. Give me your secret.</i>

08:45.525 --> 08:48.444
There's no secret,
but I'd love to fuck a rich boy.

08:48.528 --> 08:49.529
No!

09:10.550 --> 09:11.551
Can I help you?

09:12.301 --> 09:14.220
I have a meeting with a student.

09:14.804 --> 09:16.180
Do you have permission?

09:17.598 --> 09:21.018
No. She told me to come and find her.
She's waiting for me.

09:21.102 --> 09:24.522
If you call her and tell her to come out,
I can let you in.

09:25.773 --> 09:26.607
Okay.

09:32.530 --> 09:34.490
Hey! Miss!

09:34.574 --> 09:37.326
You can't do that. Miss, stop!

09:37.410 --> 09:38.286
Miss!

09:42.582 --> 09:43.499
Hey.

09:45.751 --> 09:49.463
-I just want to talk to Antonia.
-You can't run in like that.

09:49.547 --> 09:51.632
Páez, what's going on?

09:51.716 --> 09:53.217
She came in without permission.

09:56.137 --> 09:57.096
I know her.

09:57.597 --> 09:58.764
-You sure?
-Yes.

10:00.182 --> 10:01.601
-Don't worry.
-It's all good.

10:02.893 --> 10:04.520
-Where's Antonia?
-Not here.

10:05.271 --> 10:06.856
-Where is she?
-I don't know.

10:06.939 --> 10:09.400
The director kicked her out
for being late.

10:11.861 --> 10:13.738
I'll talk to him. Where is he?

10:13.821 --> 10:15.823
-Why?
-Tell me where he is.

10:15.906 --> 10:17.617
-In the auditorium. Why?
-Here?

10:54.904 --> 10:56.322
Everything okay, Mateo?

10:57.406 --> 10:58.407
Yes.

10:58.491 --> 11:00.576
So what's going on with the timing?

11:02.036 --> 11:03.037
Again.

11:16.676 --> 11:19.720
How many times
do I have to tell you you're early?

11:23.140 --> 11:25.810
I don't care
if they've told you you're a star.

11:26.519 --> 11:30.147
I really don't care about
what you've done in the past.

11:30.773 --> 11:34.110
I only care about
what you can show me today.

11:34.944 --> 11:38.698
And if you can't show me anything,
you're useless to me.

11:39.573 --> 11:41.867
There are many types of dancer.

11:41.951 --> 11:44.120
But I can only use

11:44.203 --> 11:47.248
one who can concentrate when onstage.

11:48.082 --> 11:50.543
Who can connect with the present.

11:50.626 --> 11:53.462
Forget what's happening
in the rest of the world.

11:54.004 --> 11:58.300
Do you think you can concentrate
and give us a minute?

12:00.469 --> 12:02.304
Or what kind of dancer are you?

12:06.434 --> 12:07.643
Are you the teacher?

12:08.769 --> 12:09.770
Director.

12:11.105 --> 12:12.982
Could I have a word with you?

12:17.570 --> 12:19.864
The only tickets left
are in business class.

12:20.990 --> 12:24.076
-And what's the difference?
-I'll tell you now.

12:25.244 --> 12:28.122
Shouldn't we check
if it's going to be worth it first?

12:29.832 --> 12:32.126
In for a penny, in for a pound.

13:36.607 --> 13:38.651
Antonia really cares about this.

13:41.111 --> 13:42.655
How long have you been practicing?

13:43.155 --> 13:44.240
Several days.

14:02.675 --> 14:09.598
VICENTE
ONLINE

14:13.102 --> 14:14.895
Hey. What's that?

14:15.437 --> 14:17.690
<i>Karina is at the Royal. Where are you?</i>

14:18.858 --> 14:19.859
<i>Come now.</i>

14:20.943 --> 14:22.528
Okay, I'm coming.

14:28.951 --> 14:30.911
Hello, my people.

14:32.079 --> 14:34.915
How are you?
You haven't been here for a while.

14:34.999 --> 14:37.251
I thought you'd be out all day.

14:37.334 --> 14:40.170
I was running some errands,
but I'll catch up.

14:40.254 --> 14:41.297
No, don't worry.

14:42.006 --> 14:43.757
You weren't and won't be needed.

14:44.758 --> 14:46.135
I have your replacement.

14:47.553 --> 14:50.014
From now on, Marcela will take your place.

14:54.643 --> 14:57.563
-You can't fire me.
-Why can't I?

14:59.398 --> 15:02.443
I put all my intellect into this.
I designed it all.

15:02.526 --> 15:05.237
I painted the facade, put the pictures up.

15:05.321 --> 15:07.781
I brought my people in.
Uncle, you can't do this.

15:08.365 --> 15:09.241
And the money?

15:12.328 --> 15:13.329
Who paid for it?

15:14.872 --> 15:15.873
Me, right?

15:17.207 --> 15:18.167
So beat it.

15:20.377 --> 15:21.462
Give me my money.

15:22.838 --> 15:25.841
-What money?
-My severance pay.

15:26.675 --> 15:27.801
Severance pay?

15:28.636 --> 15:30.596
Look, Ximena, I spoke to your mom.

15:31.305 --> 15:34.183
She told me your idea
about your little trip.

15:34.850 --> 15:37.895
So you want to go clean bathrooms
for the gringos, huh?

15:40.105 --> 15:40.981
Very good.

15:41.065 --> 15:42.191
But you know what?

15:43.275 --> 15:45.152
You won't get one peso out of this salon.

15:46.070 --> 15:47.071
Okay?

17:07.901 --> 17:08.777
Miranda.

17:09.361 --> 17:10.696
I need to talk to you.

17:19.913 --> 17:21.206
…I'd give him a kiss.

17:21.832 --> 17:23.208
You're unbearable.

17:25.377 --> 17:26.378
Who are you?

17:27.755 --> 17:29.339
Why are you taking our stuff?

17:30.424 --> 17:31.925
Are you Checho's little sister?

17:35.262 --> 17:36.263
Nice to meet you.

17:36.972 --> 17:38.098
Mario Casilimas.

17:42.019 --> 17:43.020
And your names are?

17:44.980 --> 17:46.273
I'm Liliana.

17:46.356 --> 17:47.357
Liliana.

17:48.067 --> 17:49.193
And the young lady?

17:50.736 --> 17:51.612
Chama.

17:52.112 --> 17:53.947
Chama. Nice to meet you.

17:55.199 --> 17:56.658
Where's my brother?

17:57.993 --> 18:00.120
I'm waiting for him.
He's bringing me something.

18:06.543 --> 18:07.377
So…

18:08.587 --> 18:09.880
What the fuck?

18:11.131 --> 18:12.132
Let's see.

18:16.845 --> 18:18.263
Hey, who came in here?

18:21.350 --> 18:23.644
-Did you take my money?
-I'm sorry, Checho.

18:23.727 --> 18:25.395
Fucking hell, Liliana.

18:28.482 --> 18:29.399
So…

18:30.400 --> 18:31.401
What's the delay?

18:37.199 --> 18:38.492
I don't have all the money.

18:39.159 --> 18:40.244
I fucked up.

18:40.828 --> 18:42.496
I took the money and spent it.

18:42.579 --> 18:44.706
I'll get you the money, man.

18:44.790 --> 18:45.999
It's not his fault.

18:46.083 --> 18:47.167
Shut it.

18:47.251 --> 18:48.919
What a tender scene.

18:49.002 --> 18:51.755
What a sight,
watching you defend each other.

18:51.839 --> 18:54.258
-But I'm bored with you.
-I have the money.

19:00.806 --> 19:02.057
What's in it for you?

19:03.433 --> 19:06.436
If they let Antonia back in,
how do you benefit?

19:06.520 --> 19:09.231
You're not doing this
purely out of goodness.

19:09.731 --> 19:10.732
No.

19:12.818 --> 19:13.819
So what?

19:15.112 --> 19:16.113
It's for money.

19:19.741 --> 19:22.202
-How much?
-That's between her and me, okay?

19:25.914 --> 19:27.583
-Hello?
-Karina, dude.

19:27.666 --> 19:29.835
I need you to bring that money now.

19:29.918 --> 19:30.919
<i>Why?</i>

19:31.503 --> 19:33.297
I fucked up.

19:33.380 --> 19:36.633
I got Checho in big trouble.
If I don't pay now, they'll kill him.

19:36.717 --> 19:37.551
What?

19:38.051 --> 19:40.846
-How come? I don't understand.
<i>-Yes, dude.</i>

19:42.097 --> 19:43.348
How long will you be?

19:48.979 --> 19:52.191
-Two hours. Tell him to give me two hours.
-<i>Two hours.</i>

19:53.066 --> 19:54.067
Okay.

19:54.693 --> 19:55.694
Two hours.

19:57.446 --> 19:58.447
Two hours.

20:07.581 --> 20:09.374
Do I look like someone else, asshole?

20:10.584 --> 20:11.919
What are you looking at?

20:21.720 --> 20:23.263
Vis, what happened?

20:28.894 --> 20:30.854
You have 15 minutes to get ready.

20:32.940 --> 20:35.067
To get ready for what?

20:35.817 --> 20:38.195
To present your choreography.

20:40.072 --> 20:41.281
What choreography?

20:41.990 --> 20:44.701
What we rehearsed. They want to see it.

20:47.079 --> 20:48.705
We'll be in the auditorium.

20:50.165 --> 20:52.376
-Are you joking?
-They want to see it.

20:53.669 --> 20:57.798
Fuck, what's in that head of yours
for you to fuck up like this?

20:57.881 --> 20:59.675
I'm trying to fix it, Checho.

20:59.758 --> 21:01.635
-What more can I do?
-Fix this?

21:01.718 --> 21:04.179
Where will you get three million pesos?

21:04.263 --> 21:06.473
I'm not a child. I'm going to fix this.

21:06.556 --> 21:08.558
What a shame about Checho, dude.

21:09.184 --> 21:10.185
"About Checho"?

21:10.727 --> 21:12.938
You mean Bombita. She did it for us.

21:13.021 --> 21:14.982
Who told Liliana to take that money?

21:15.065 --> 21:16.692
Listen to yourself, Ximena.

21:17.276 --> 21:20.237
She did what she did
for this group we're all in.

21:20.821 --> 21:22.864
Well, almost all of us.

21:23.949 --> 21:27.494
When did you stop caring about us?
You used to be up for everything.

21:28.328 --> 21:30.038
For rehearsals, all-nighters.

21:32.749 --> 21:34.167
Listen to them in there.

21:34.876 --> 21:35.919
See that?

21:36.003 --> 21:39.339
Whenever one of us tries to work hard,
we end up in a mess.

21:39.923 --> 21:40.924
Today was a mistake.

21:41.008 --> 21:43.844
And what happened at Al Garete
was a miracle?

21:43.927 --> 21:46.346
My problems with my uncle,
Karina's with her boss,

21:46.430 --> 21:47.514
and yours with money.

21:51.476 --> 21:54.146
We'll never achieve anything
with Pura Kaye.

21:55.272 --> 21:57.691
Let me know
when we've got something great.

22:09.328 --> 22:10.996
Boss, yes, sir. Tell me.

22:14.374 --> 22:16.209
Yes, sir, don't worry--

22:20.339 --> 22:21.340
Yes, sir.

22:23.925 --> 22:24.926
Yes, boss.

22:28.472 --> 22:31.308
If he hasn't got the money in two hours,
I'll finish him.

22:31.933 --> 22:33.852
I'll kill that son of a bitch myself.

22:36.104 --> 22:37.105
Trust me.

22:38.565 --> 22:39.566
Yes, sir.

22:48.575 --> 22:49.701
Fuck!

22:50.327 --> 22:51.828
-Why don't you--
-Shut it!

22:53.205 --> 22:54.373
Get out of here.

23:00.712 --> 23:02.005
That fucking Checho.

23:03.423 --> 23:04.800
Son of a bitch, Checho.

23:11.306 --> 23:13.266
-Where can I put music on?
-There.

23:14.184 --> 23:15.519
Karina, no, dude.

23:16.561 --> 23:18.271
I don't get what we're doing.

23:22.109 --> 23:23.693
Right, okay.

23:26.279 --> 23:27.989
Something like this to start.

23:32.452 --> 23:35.372
You're crazy if you think
I'm going to do that.

23:35.455 --> 23:36.623
Why not?

23:36.706 --> 23:40.919
Because I don't have your flow
or your street style to improvise that.

23:41.002 --> 23:43.547
That doesn't matter.
It's beyond that. It's…

23:43.630 --> 23:46.299
It's more than the technique
and the movement.

23:47.426 --> 23:48.510
You have to feel it.

23:48.593 --> 23:52.639
Okay, so you want me
to go out on that stage and "feel it"?

23:52.722 --> 23:54.975
-Jump about like crazy?
-And the video?

23:55.058 --> 23:58.228
What were you doing there?
Feeling it. You enjoyed it.

23:58.311 --> 24:00.564
Karina, it's different.

24:01.523 --> 24:05.110
In that video
we were all tripping in a park.

24:06.987 --> 24:08.947
That's what the teacher liked.

24:09.030 --> 24:11.950
He's not a teacher.
He's the director of the show.

24:12.033 --> 24:14.119
You bought us some time with that video,

24:14.202 --> 24:16.913
but that doesn't mean
we should go out there

24:16.997 --> 24:19.708
and improvise something
we haven't rehearsed.

24:19.791 --> 24:20.792
I understand you.

24:23.712 --> 24:25.964
But try to get out of your head a bit.

24:26.882 --> 24:30.343
They're waiting for you.
Enjoy it. Feel it. You have it.

24:31.428 --> 24:32.429
Trust me.

24:36.266 --> 24:38.810
Have fun with it.
That's all you have to do.

24:39.853 --> 24:40.854
Okay.

24:41.897 --> 24:42.898
So?

24:46.902 --> 24:48.236
What are we watching?

24:48.945 --> 24:50.155
Crazy. What is this?

24:51.531 --> 24:53.325
You know how Antonia is.

24:53.408 --> 24:55.494
She won't give up on her scholarship.

26:20.078 --> 26:21.079
And?

26:22.372 --> 26:23.665
What do you think?

26:25.000 --> 26:27.127
Jacobo, don't disappoint me.

26:28.628 --> 26:29.796
Why'd you bring me?

26:34.467 --> 26:36.928
Girls, congratulations to you both.

26:38.555 --> 26:39.889
What does that mean?

26:41.224 --> 26:42.309
Antonia,

26:43.184 --> 26:44.728
you can return to the Royal.

26:46.646 --> 26:47.647
But not alone.

26:48.607 --> 26:50.025
We want you to join her.

26:51.735 --> 26:52.736
What?

26:53.320 --> 26:54.237
How come?

26:54.321 --> 26:57.032
We want you to give
the street style you gave Antonia

26:57.574 --> 26:58.908
to the show.

27:03.288 --> 27:04.748
No, I don't…

27:05.498 --> 27:06.625
I can't.

27:07.334 --> 27:09.419
Let's talk over here for a second.

27:13.673 --> 27:16.760
Just give me my money now.
That's all I need.

27:24.017 --> 27:25.018
I don't have it.

27:26.394 --> 27:29.648
I'm sorry, but I honestly thought
the deal was off.

27:29.731 --> 27:31.733
-What?
-I told you I don't have it.

27:32.859 --> 27:35.362
-Give me a few days and I'll get it.
-Fuck!

27:36.821 --> 27:39.407
This is life or death. I'm not joking.

27:41.993 --> 27:43.953
I'll get it for you, Karina.

27:44.913 --> 27:45.914
Motherfucker.

27:51.419 --> 27:52.420
Fuck.

27:53.213 --> 27:54.881
Fuck. What am I going to do?

28:00.637 --> 28:02.972
What do I do? Fuck.

28:03.056 --> 28:04.391
Fuck.

28:32.669 --> 28:33.670
Karina.

28:35.922 --> 28:36.923
Hello?

28:38.383 --> 28:40.385
<i>I don't have the money.</i>

28:40.885 --> 28:41.803
What?

28:41.886 --> 28:45.014
<i>They let me down, but it's okay.</i>
<i>It's all good. I'm coming now</i>

28:45.724 --> 28:47.058
to show my face, okay?

28:48.518 --> 28:49.519
Bye.

28:58.903 --> 29:01.030
See? They were never going to get it.

29:05.618 --> 29:08.037
-What will you do?
-Fix your problem, sis.

29:11.291 --> 29:12.208
Stop it.

29:12.751 --> 29:13.668
<i>Antonia.</i>

29:14.878 --> 29:16.921
-Antonia.
-What?

29:17.005 --> 29:18.465
Where are you going?

29:21.509 --> 29:24.471
I don't know,
but I have to get that money somehow.

29:26.723 --> 29:30.435
Checho, I can talk to the guy.
We can come to an agreement.

29:31.478 --> 29:32.645
You're so naive.

29:34.063 --> 29:36.983
Curro isn't some idiot
you can pull a fast one on.

29:37.066 --> 29:40.195
-What will you do?
-You have to face this scum head-on.

29:40.820 --> 29:43.823
-Please don't do anything stupid.
-What, then?

29:45.408 --> 29:48.578
What do I do?
Wait for them to come and kill us all?

29:48.661 --> 29:51.498
-What are you going to do, then?
-What I have to.

29:52.457 --> 29:54.250
I have to get that money.

29:55.752 --> 29:56.586
That's all.

29:57.086 --> 29:59.756
-Are you crazy?
-You don't know that guy.

30:00.548 --> 30:02.675
That scumbag really is crazy.

30:03.343 --> 30:07.263
But us girls can talk to him,
agree on something.

30:10.600 --> 30:11.601
You know what?

30:12.602 --> 30:16.356
If he gets here first,
tell him I went to get Karina, okay?

30:17.816 --> 30:20.527
If anything happens, call me.
I'll check my phone.

30:21.945 --> 30:23.571
-Checho, wait.
-That's it.

30:23.655 --> 30:25.240
Okay? That's it.

30:28.618 --> 30:30.662
You should go to Dembow.

30:33.414 --> 30:34.499
What do you mean?

30:35.500 --> 30:37.877
My uncle has money stashed there.

30:37.961 --> 30:41.422
-Are you crazy?
-Should he rob a bank or a jewelry store?

30:42.173 --> 30:43.174
That's worse.

30:46.427 --> 30:47.345
So?

30:49.722 --> 30:53.518
Next to the register
in the first drawer there's a white box.

30:54.018 --> 30:57.105
Inside are the month's earnings.

30:57.897 --> 31:01.734
My uncle will be out at this time,
so you'd better go now.

31:07.073 --> 31:08.867
Okay. Got it.

31:08.950 --> 31:10.493
Checho, be careful, okay?

31:12.745 --> 31:14.163
It'll all be fine, okay?

31:16.332 --> 31:17.333
See you later.

31:23.131 --> 31:25.550
This could cost you your job
and the house.

31:26.551 --> 31:27.927
I no longer have a job.

31:30.930 --> 31:33.016
And that house has never been mine.

33:52.739 --> 33:57.452
