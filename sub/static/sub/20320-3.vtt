WEBVTT

00:07.441 --> 00:10.170
Yeah, I got it, don't worry.

00:11.302 --> 00:13.938
Hey, so it's cool
if I crash with you?

00:15.974 --> 00:18.508
<i>Mi couch es su couch, amigo.</i>

00:18.577 --> 00:21.411
Yeah, your landlord say when he's
going to fix that hole in the roof?

00:21.479 --> 00:23.138
He said nothing about
fixing anything, my friend.

00:23.258 --> 00:26.331
- He's said they're gonna mop up and give me
the all-clear. - You're gonna move back in?

00:26.451 --> 00:29.819
- Beats being homeless.
- You know, there are stops

00:29.887 --> 00:32.154
between a leaky attic
and total homelessness.

00:32.222 --> 00:34.857
Hey, you know, I'd love to
live in a rent-controlled palace

00:34.925 --> 00:37.026
like you, OK?
Some of us aren't so lucky.

00:37.094 --> 00:39.028
This is light.
There's nothing in this.

00:39.096 --> 00:41.731
- It's just a nice container.
- Yeah.

00:41.799 --> 00:44.766
Yeah, it wasn't luck. I scoured
the city for that place.

00:44.834 --> 00:46.835
Yeah, well, I'm more
of a skimmer than a scourer.

00:46.903 --> 00:50.271
Look, you need to upgrade
your living situation, OK?

00:50.339 --> 00:53.875
A man's home is his castle.
And you, my friend,

00:53.943 --> 00:56.244
you're living in a moat.

00:56.312 --> 00:59.113
Yeah, you know what?
This is pathetic.

00:59.180 --> 01:01.348
I'm a man! I should be
living like a man--

01:01.416 --> 01:04.485
like a grown-ass man, you know? A
place to hang my hat and all that.

01:04.552 --> 01:06.621
I mean, I don't wear a hat,
but if I did--

01:06.688 --> 01:09.023
- You'd have a place to hang it.
- Exactly.

01:09.091 --> 01:11.325
To grown-ass men.
And castles.

01:11.392 --> 01:13.327
- And hats.
- Hats.

01:13.394 --> 01:15.328

01:43.422 --> 01:46.091
You're gonna keep doing this
till you get it right.

01:46.159 --> 01:50.294
Five, six, seven, eight.

01:50.362 --> 01:53.998
Don't think about dancing;
think about killing something.

01:54.066 --> 01:57.368
Killing... mediocrity.

01:57.435 --> 01:58.836
Apathy.

01:58.904 --> 02:01.572
Ah! Ah!

02:04.308 --> 02:06.276
You have five minutes
to get that ankle wrapped.

02:09.613 --> 02:12.582
- Damian, you OK?
- Come one, let's get that wrapped up.

02:12.650 --> 02:16.153
- I told you about Damian.
- I'm not giving up on him.

02:16.220 --> 02:18.055
Hey.

02:18.122 --> 02:21.057
Juice? Fruit?
Neck rub?

02:21.124 --> 02:23.392
None of the above, Bodie,
but thanks.

02:23.459 --> 02:25.995
Just doing my job, gorgeous.

02:26.063 --> 02:30.365
OK. Sound. Let's work
the bridge in the meantime.

02:30.433 --> 02:36.705
Who moved this? No one touches
Jade's mic, people!

02:36.772 --> 02:39.308
(Electrical shock)

02:39.375 --> 02:42.811
- Bodie? Bodie!
- No, no, no, don't touch him!

02:42.878 --> 02:45.547
Don't touch him! Don't touch
him! Call an ambulance!

02:45.615 --> 02:47.516
Call an ambulance!

03:06.423 --> 03:08.356
Hey. Rough night?

03:08.425 --> 03:10.357
Mm... I don't remember.

03:10.426 --> 03:13.060
How is it that you're able to
have a social life and I'm not?

03:13.128 --> 03:15.930
Mm, our next case.
Let's talk about that.

03:15.997 --> 03:17.865
We have a few things
on the backburner:

03:17.933 --> 03:19.901
cyber crime ring
working out of Hamilton;

03:19.968 --> 03:21.869
I spoke to the IMET unit
about a possible

03:21.937 --> 03:23.871
securities fraud case--
nothing imminent

03:23.939 --> 03:26.406
or particularly exciting.

03:26.474 --> 03:29.208
Well, let me propose
something that is.

03:29.276 --> 03:31.645
- You two have heard of Jade?
- Yeah.

03:31.712 --> 03:34.080
I'm not a fan myself.
Pop's not my thing.

03:34.148 --> 03:36.082
- Are you serious?
- Yeah, what, you are?

03:36.150 --> 03:38.051
- I am a big fan.
- You're a big fan? Come on.

03:38.118 --> 03:40.420
Yeah, man. She's smart,
fearless, courts controversy.

03:40.488 --> 03:42.588
Courting controversy?
She wore a dress with raw fish

03:42.656 --> 03:45.057
to an awards show.
That's courting soy sauce.

03:45.124 --> 03:47.192
Well, I'm assuming you've
both heard there was a death

03:47.260 --> 03:49.528
yesterday
at her rehearsal studio?

03:49.596 --> 03:51.430
Yeah, it was on the news--
crew guy got accidentally

03:51.498 --> 03:54.500
- electrocuted.
- Mm, well, it was no accident.

03:54.568 --> 03:56.502
Her microphone was sabotaged.

03:56.570 --> 03:59.003
We have reason to believe
someone is trying to kill her.

03:59.071 --> 04:01.005
- I definitely want in on this.
- Oh, no.

04:01.073 --> 04:03.441
I'll tell Metro
that we're taking over the case.

04:03.509 --> 04:05.777
Hey, this is cool:
Queen Street West,

04:05.845 --> 04:08.613
top floor of a house, laundry
in basement, junior one bedroom.

04:08.681 --> 04:10.582
What does that mean?
Junior one bedroom?

04:10.649 --> 04:12.617
It means you could probably
touch all four walls

04:12.685 --> 04:15.018
- standing in one place.
- Ugh! Pass.

04:15.086 --> 04:17.387
Who is this "Craig", and who
told him he could make lists?

04:17.454 --> 04:19.990
Oz, finding an apartment is
brutal!

04:20.057 --> 04:23.460
- Especially with your criteria.
- Hey, all I want is

04:23.527 --> 04:26.196
a nice, one-bedroom apartment
in a cool area

04:26.263 --> 04:29.099
with a pool and a fireplace,
and a tenants-only gym,

04:29.166 --> 04:32.035
- and a 24-hour concierge.
- Look, my one-bedroom apartment

04:32.103 --> 04:34.804
has no pool, no fireplace, and
the area is certainly not cool,

04:34.872 --> 04:36.806
and I still pay $1250 a month.

04:36.874 --> 04:39.274
OK, I can budge
on the fireplace.

04:39.342 --> 04:41.443
So, what do we know about Jade?

04:41.511 --> 04:43.178
AKA Sasha Dixon.

04:43.246 --> 04:46.115
Emancipated herself at 16.
A real wild child, but smart--

04:46.182 --> 04:49.318
she graduated with top honours
while living on the street.

04:49.386 --> 04:51.820
She made some noise on
the Toronto underground scene,

04:51.888 --> 04:54.722
discovered by JC, an ex-rapper.
He became her manager.

04:54.789 --> 04:56.424
What about her personal life?

04:56.492 --> 04:58.692
Her personal life is highly
guarded by her publicity team.

04:58.760 --> 05:01.662
Well, we do know that she has
a stalker problem:

05:01.730 --> 05:03.998
Marco Silvestri:
the super fan.

05:04.066 --> 05:06.000
He has a restraining order
against him,

05:06.068 --> 05:09.070
which he's violated five times.
JC has notified police

05:09.138 --> 05:11.004
that he thinks
he might be escalating.

05:11.072 --> 05:13.006
I'll get a unit
to check out his address.

05:13.074 --> 05:15.742
OK. Homicide is at the studio.
Why don't you go

05:15.809 --> 05:18.478
check in about the mic?
You and I are going

05:18.546 --> 05:20.747
- to talk to Jade's manager.
- Cool.

05:22.816 --> 05:26.452
Bodie had a wife and kids.
It's been tough for everybody.

05:26.520 --> 05:28.921
Is there any chance that
he could have been the target?

05:28.988 --> 05:30.989
The man never had an enemy
in the world.

05:31.058 --> 05:34.793
- How is Jade doing?
- Her and Bodie were real tight, so, you know,

05:34.861 --> 05:36.429
it's tough for her.

05:36.496 --> 05:38.730
You know, but she's trying
to be... trying to be strong,

05:38.798 --> 05:40.999
trying to hide it
from everybody--you know,

05:41.068 --> 05:43.968
the girl's solid steel.

05:44.036 --> 05:46.037
Just like me.

05:46.105 --> 05:48.839
What can you tell us
about Marco Silvestri?

05:48.907 --> 05:51.543
He was Jade's biggest fan,
ran a kick-ass fan site,

05:51.610 --> 05:53.678
so I hired him
to run Jade's official site.

05:53.745 --> 05:56.347
Then he started getting crazy,
started going to her house

05:56.415 --> 06:00.016
at the wee hours of the morning,
and... phoning her all the time,

06:00.085 --> 06:03.120
so... I fired him.

06:03.188 --> 06:06.490
You think he's capable
of violence?

06:17.401 --> 06:20.136
Yeah, he's capable.

06:20.204 --> 06:23.672
Is there anyone else that we should know about?
Someone from her personal life?

06:23.740 --> 06:26.041
I know nothing
about Jade's personal life.

06:26.110 --> 06:29.378
She's built a wall so high
even I couldn't see over it.

06:29.446 --> 06:31.413
You're her manager, you're her
producer, you're the president

06:31.481 --> 06:33.482
of her label--if you're
not close to her, who is?

06:33.549 --> 06:35.517
Look, it's complicated
between me and her.

06:35.585 --> 06:37.486
I had a shot back in the days,
but I try to help her

06:37.553 --> 06:40.054
so she won't make the same
mistakes I did. But...

06:40.123 --> 06:44.092
you know, she doesn't like being taught.
She's got a lot of pride.

06:44.160 --> 06:45.927
(He chuckles)

06:45.995 --> 06:50.131
- Again, just like me.
- OK, Jason Coleman. He ran

06:50.198 --> 06:54.034
a street gang before he discovered music.
Saw an unpolished diamond

06:54.102 --> 06:56.737
in Jade, and under his wing
she broke worldwide.

06:56.804 --> 06:58.972
Sounds like
he's good at his job.

06:59.040 --> 07:01.842
Yeah. The Anti-Racketeering Unit are looking
into the methods he used to break Jade--

07:01.909 --> 07:04.244
bribery, corruption, coercion.

07:04.311 --> 07:07.113
OK, so JC's a person of interest.
We need to know more.

07:07.181 --> 07:09.715
Find someone close
to the organization.

07:09.783 --> 07:11.817
(Telephone ringing)

07:15.055 --> 07:17.257
You've been with Jade
a long time, Damian.

07:17.324 --> 07:19.525
Since her very first show
as Jade.

07:19.592 --> 07:21.627
Even back then
she was a little dictator.

07:21.694 --> 07:24.263
So why do you dance for her?

07:24.330 --> 07:27.633
Because she's a genius.
And, I mean, yeah, sure,

07:27.700 --> 07:30.035
she can be a demanding witch.

07:30.102 --> 07:32.271
But she's got my back.

07:32.338 --> 07:35.540
When my dad died,
she was there for me.

07:35.607 --> 07:39.109
And I know that she's fought
to keep me on this tour.

07:39.178 --> 07:41.679
- Fought with who?
- JC.

07:41.746 --> 07:45.316
That's his MO. Anybody
in Jade's camp he wants gone.

07:45.384 --> 07:46.817
Because...?

07:46.885 --> 07:48.986
It's about control with him.

07:49.054 --> 07:51.321
But he's met his match
when it comes to Jade.

07:51.389 --> 07:53.390
- What do you mean?
- Jade...

07:53.457 --> 07:57.060
can be extremely difficult.

07:57.127 --> 07:59.829
Love the girl, but she seems
oblivious to the fact

07:59.897 --> 08:02.566
that half the people around her
can't stand her.

08:02.633 --> 08:05.902
Anyone with a serious grudge?

08:05.969 --> 08:09.338
Our last lighting director,
Rodney Squires.

08:09.406 --> 08:12.675
He missed a cue during a charity
gig, got canned that night,

08:12.742 --> 08:15.744
caused major drama
on his way out.

08:15.812 --> 08:18.647
Well, thank you for your time.
If we have any more questions,

08:18.715 --> 08:20.649
I'll be in touch.

08:20.717 --> 08:22.684
Thanks.

08:22.751 --> 08:25.253
Just, uh, right out there.
Thank you.

08:27.223 --> 08:29.357
- Hey.
- Hey.

08:29.425 --> 08:33.193
- Did you get anything? - Yeah, I saw a guy
flipping out. I figure it was Squires.

08:33.261 --> 08:37.030
Well, he's certainly a person of
interest, so I will talk to him ASAP.

08:37.099 --> 08:39.332
Cool. You want me
to come along for a read?

08:39.400 --> 08:42.936
No. How would you feel
about joining the music biz?

08:46.374 --> 08:48.041
So, the stand must be
insulated.

08:48.109 --> 08:51.111
Yeah. Clearly
Jade was the target.

08:51.178 --> 08:54.114
The guy got zapped
with 200 amps--

08:54.181 --> 08:56.148
that's enough to kill a horse.

09:03.624 --> 09:05.591
This cable's been
hybridized--

09:05.659 --> 09:08.694
It carries both the acoustic
wiring and a high-voltage wire.

09:08.762 --> 09:10.295
Hmm.

09:14.099 --> 09:16.067
Do all of these run
down to the basement?

09:16.135 --> 09:18.136
Yeah, down
to the electrical room.

09:18.203 --> 09:21.673
(Phone ringing)
Dev. What's going on?

09:21.741 --> 09:23.708
Well, I'm in the electrical
room of the studio.

09:23.776 --> 09:27.611
I'm looking at a 347 volt box,
armoured cable, BX clamps,

09:27.679 --> 09:30.113
- conduit KOs.
- That all means what, exactly?

09:30.181 --> 09:34.217
Well, it means that we know a
little bit more about our killer.

09:34.286 --> 09:36.153
<i>I bet he was</i>
<i>President of the AV Club.</i>

09:36.220 --> 09:38.255
<i>The good news is</i>
<i>this door has a keypad.</i>

09:38.323 --> 09:40.291
So if there's record of access,

09:40.358 --> 09:43.359
we're a little bit closer
to finding out who this guy is.

09:43.427 --> 09:45.561
OK, nice work.
I'll see you back here.

09:45.629 --> 09:47.897
You should get to the studio.

09:47.964 --> 09:50.099
Yay. Um...

09:50.167 --> 09:53.002
- any tips?
- Your job is to scan

09:53.069 --> 09:56.005
for suspects and make notes. Any sign of
trouble, alert the bodyguard and hang back.

09:56.072 --> 09:58.473
- OK.

♪ Ha! Ha! Ha! Hey! Hey! ♪

10:34.975 --> 10:37.043
Bodie was a good man.

10:37.110 --> 10:40.046
But you got the wrong guy.
I don't know anything about it.

10:40.113 --> 10:42.181
I got fired off the tour
two weeks ago.

10:42.249 --> 10:44.517
I heard you left
on bad terms, Rodney.

10:44.585 --> 10:46.952
You could say that.
They fired me for no reason.

10:47.019 --> 10:49.722
I spoke to your union.
They said you filed a complaint?

10:49.789 --> 10:51.256
Yeah. Big mistake.

10:51.324 --> 10:53.492
JC has it fixed
so I can't get a designer gig.

10:53.560 --> 10:55.794
So now I'm back here
humping cable and lights.

10:55.862 --> 10:58.029
Well, you must be furious.

11:00.132 --> 11:03.735
Twenty years of experience flushed
down the toilet. What do you think?

11:03.802 --> 11:06.937
I think
I'd be looking for revenge.

11:07.005 --> 11:09.640
And I think if you had anything on
me, you'd be hauling me downtown,

11:09.708 --> 11:11.112
so if you're done fishing...

11:13.078 --> 11:16.146
All right, move. Guys,
when your arms go like that,

11:16.214 --> 11:18.582
I want to see a clean line
like this.

11:23.688 --> 11:26.523
- [Girl]: <i>Oh, he's so hot.
- [Guy]: Why doesn't she just ask me out?</i>

11:26.591 --> 11:29.192
[Girl]: <i>Total control freak.</i>

11:29.260 --> 11:31.595
[Guy]: <i>I just have to wait</i>
<i>for the right time.</i>

11:31.662 --> 11:34.997
[Girl]: <i>Same thing</i>
<i>over and over.</i>

11:35.064 --> 11:37.032
[Girl]: <i>Nothing I do is</i>
<i>good enough.</i>

11:37.100 --> 11:39.802
Hey, can I speak to you
for a second?

11:39.870 --> 11:42.905
- Hey!
- Ugh!

11:45.842 --> 11:47.443
Marco!

11:47.511 --> 11:48.878
Ah!

11:52.247 --> 11:54.816
Jade!
(Glass shattering)

11:54.884 --> 11:56.317
(Door closing)

12:09.452 --> 12:12.057
- How'd you get this crew pass?
- I made it.

12:12.177 --> 12:14.189
I'm good at Illustrator.

12:14.257 --> 12:19.361
Why don't you tell me
about this weapon?

12:19.429 --> 12:22.197
<i>- I needed it to protect myself.
- [Dev]: From whom?</i>

12:22.265 --> 12:24.231
<i>Jade's bodyguard.</i>

12:24.299 --> 12:26.701
Roughed me up pretty good
last time.

12:26.769 --> 12:30.404
- He's probably just doing his job.
- Look, I need to talk to Jade.

12:30.472 --> 12:32.774
I heard what happened to Bodie.

12:32.841 --> 12:36.477
I couldn't eat,
I couldn't sleep.

12:39.247 --> 12:41.182
Is Jade OK?

12:41.249 --> 12:44.552
Can I see her?

12:44.619 --> 12:48.189
You do realize there's a restraining
order against you, right?

12:48.256 --> 12:51.459
Yeah, I don't care about that.
All I care about is Jade.

12:51.526 --> 12:53.527
And she cares about me.

12:53.595 --> 12:55.962
No, actually,
I don't think she does.

12:56.029 --> 12:58.098
- Take that back!
- In fact,

12:58.165 --> 13:00.100
I'm pretty sure
she thinks you're a freak.

13:00.167 --> 13:03.136
<i>- Jade loves me!</i>
<i>- So it's clear he suffers</i>

13:03.204 --> 13:05.271
from some kind
of delusional disorder.

13:05.339 --> 13:07.307
Yeah,
I've come across it before.

13:07.374 --> 13:11.010
When their reality threatens their
fantasy world, it can become dangerous.

13:11.078 --> 13:13.912
Do we think he has the skill
to sabotage the microphone?

13:13.980 --> 13:17.349
Who knows? If you can learn how to
make a bomb on the internet nowadays--

13:17.417 --> 13:19.718
You can learn how
to wire a mic. Good point.

13:19.785 --> 13:21.753
- So, where's Jade?
- She's, uh,

13:21.821 --> 13:23.755
in her recording studio.
I'm gonna meet up with her

13:23.823 --> 13:26.558
in a little bit. She's got
an appearance at a nightclub.

13:26.626 --> 13:30.328
- OK, well, I'll send backup.
- Cool. Let's hope I don't need them.

13:37.636 --> 13:41.139
Well, if there's no shower and no bathtub,
how am I supposed to clean myself?

13:41.206 --> 13:42.773
That's rude.

13:42.841 --> 13:44.341
(Phone beeps)

13:44.408 --> 13:47.310
- How goes the apartment hunt?
- Oh, don't ask, man.

13:47.378 --> 13:49.979
Well, you could always move
back in with your folks, right?

13:50.047 --> 13:53.416
What am I, the Turkish George Costanza?
No, I gotta find my own place.

13:53.484 --> 13:56.786
You're not gonna believe what they got me
doing at IIB right now. I'm undercover.

13:56.854 --> 13:58.788
I'm Jade's assistant.
You know Jade?

13:58.856 --> 14:00.456
Jade, like pop star Jade?

14:00.524 --> 14:02.591
- Yeah.
- Yes, I know Jade! I mean,

14:02.659 --> 14:05.060
her music's not really for me;
it's for girls.

14:05.128 --> 14:08.164
But I totally get why she's
popular. Plus, she's crazy hot.

14:08.231 --> 14:10.199
Well, she's also got a stalker
trying to kill her.

14:10.267 --> 14:13.202
- Really? - Yeah. They want me to hang
around Jade, keep my ears open,

14:13.270 --> 14:15.436
see what I can find out. She's
not easy to get through to.

14:15.504 --> 14:17.705
Why don't you giver her
the wounded wolf eyes?

14:17.773 --> 14:19.940
- What, you mean these?
- Yeah.

14:20.008 --> 14:22.076
I don't think
she's gonna buy it.

14:22.144 --> 14:24.679
Well, you gotta find a way
to earn her respect.

14:24.746 --> 14:27.748
There's this read I got from her stalker.
I can't get it out of my head.

14:27.816 --> 14:31.351
She's... on the floor
and she's screaming,

14:31.419 --> 14:34.354
- and it's bloody and it's...
- Wait a second.

14:34.422 --> 14:36.990
This video for her song
"You Killed Me".

14:37.058 --> 14:40.694

15:04.718 --> 15:07.219
Wait, what are you saying?
He's not trying to kill her?

15:07.286 --> 15:10.255
No, I didn't say that. I just,
uh, I mean, it was intense.

15:10.323 --> 15:13.192
It was like he was inside the video
playing the role of the killer.

15:13.259 --> 15:16.762
OK, well, we have surveillance on him.
If he makes a move, we'll know.

15:16.830 --> 15:19.997
- I'll check back in later.
- All right. Cool.

15:20.065 --> 15:22.734
(Computer beeping)
Let's check the last time

15:22.801 --> 15:25.302
the electrical room was accessed
before the murder.

15:27.272 --> 15:30.842
The door was unlocked at 3:42am
and then locked again

15:30.909 --> 15:34.178
at 4:34am. I'd say that's just
enough time to do the wiring.

15:34.246 --> 15:38.882
Well, that eliminates JC. According to this
itinerary, he was flying back from LA.

15:38.950 --> 15:42.753
So, if this door has key-code
access, can we tell who opened it?

15:42.820 --> 15:44.955
Each department is issued
a specific key code.

15:45.022 --> 15:47.590
This door was accessed by...
(Computer beeping)

15:47.658 --> 15:49.259
key code 1200,

15:49.326 --> 15:52.594
which belongs to...
Lighting.

15:52.662 --> 15:55.397
Hello, Rodney Squires.

15:55.465 --> 15:58.333
- You guys don't have anything.
- I think the crown attorney

15:58.401 --> 16:00.636
would beg to differ. We have
motive and we have means.

16:00.703 --> 16:03.172
And we have proof
that your key code was used

16:03.240 --> 16:08.343
to access the door to the electrical
room at 3:42am Tuesday morning.

16:08.411 --> 16:11.480
Hold on. I was only canned
just two weeks ago.

16:11.547 --> 16:14.215
The security company probably
forgot to disable my code.

16:14.284 --> 16:17.152
That still doesn't explain how your
code was used to access the door.

16:17.219 --> 16:20.355
Security in that building is a joke!
Key codes are traded freely.

16:20.423 --> 16:22.658
I mean, anybody could have used
that code. Anybody.

16:22.725 --> 16:25.393
Can you verify your
whereabouts Tuesday morning?

16:28.096 --> 16:30.464
All right, I am not gonna lie
to you guys.

16:30.532 --> 16:32.199
I was drunk.

16:32.267 --> 16:35.135
I mean really drunk.
I blacked out

16:35.203 --> 16:37.871
and I woke up around noon
at my place.

16:37.939 --> 16:39.807
So maybe you don't remember
going to the studio,

16:39.874 --> 16:42.175
doing a little wiring.

16:45.946 --> 16:50.249

Screw that. You're coming
with me. Now. Come on.

Hey, Jade? We're getting you out of here now, OK?
I'm concerned for your safety. Let's go.

17:28.252 --> 17:32.155
- Safe is boring.
- We're leaving! Let's go.

17:32.223 --> 17:37.427
Sorry, everybody. Show's over. Hey,
don't talk to me; talk to this guy.

17:37.495 --> 17:41.832
(Crowd booing) - Come on, let's go.
- Are you happy now?

17:41.899 --> 17:44.967
- Come on.
- I don't like being told what to do.

17:45.034 --> 17:47.837
- No one said you had to like it. Let's go.
- Please, sir,

17:47.904 --> 17:50.138
- may I use the bathroom?
- OK.

17:50.206 --> 17:52.408

- You're good.
- Yeah, I have my moments.

18:05.087 --> 18:07.522
All right, let's get her home.

18:07.590 --> 18:09.858
Come on.

18:21.803 --> 18:23.236
Sweet ride.

18:23.304 --> 18:25.572
- Thank you.
- How many CCs?

18:25.640 --> 18:27.207
Nine hundred.

18:27.275 --> 18:29.676
Air cooled?

18:29.744 --> 18:33.212
Yeah.
You know your bikes.

18:33.280 --> 18:35.681
Yeah, a friend of mine had one.

18:46.192 --> 18:48.827
So, your friend with the bike,
what was her name?

18:48.895 --> 18:52.130
- How do you know it's a her?
- It's a lucky guess.

18:52.197 --> 18:54.866
Well, I don't like talking
about her,

18:54.934 --> 18:56.735
and I don't like being put
under a microscope.

18:56.803 --> 18:59.504
I don't get this, OK?
Someone's trying to kill you,

18:59.572 --> 19:01.873
- and it's like you don't care.
- Don't analyze me.

19:01.941 --> 19:05.142
I'm not, I'm just here
trying to help save your life.

19:05.209 --> 19:08.412
OK. I get it.

19:41.032 --> 19:42.464
Jade,

19:42.532 --> 19:44.366
this is Sergeant McCluskey.

19:44.434 --> 19:46.550
Hey, Jade.
It's really nice to meet you.

19:46.670 --> 19:50.072
I'm sorry it's not
under better circumstances.

19:50.140 --> 19:53.009
Do you have any idea
who may have done this?

19:53.076 --> 19:57.479

everybody's got their reasons?

20:11.694 --> 20:14.028
Not right now,
if you don't mind.

20:14.095 --> 20:15.863
This is a crime scene.

20:15.931 --> 20:18.232
Jade, we have
to get Forensics in here.

20:18.300 --> 20:21.768
- How long will it take? - It's gonna take
as long as it takes, and in the meantime

20:21.837 --> 20:24.338
we're gonna have a police unit
outside your door, OK?

20:24.405 --> 20:27.708
- I just want to be left alone.
- Look, we respect your privacy,

20:27.775 --> 20:30.476
but you gotta let us
do our jobs, Jade.

20:30.544 --> 20:33.179
Good night, Toby.

20:38.986 --> 20:40.887
Why would Marco or anybody

20:40.955 --> 20:43.789
break into Jade's house to paint
a song title on her window?

20:43.858 --> 20:45.758
It seems like we're
back to square one here.

20:45.826 --> 20:48.393
Well, I don't think we are.
I think the song "You Killed Me"

20:48.461 --> 20:51.563
is significant, and I saw Jade
singing it with motorcycle girl.

20:51.630 --> 20:53.598
- [Klein]: Who is she?
- Samantha Lawrence.

20:53.666 --> 20:56.801
She graduated from the same
high school class as Jade.

20:56.870 --> 21:00.072
- And where is this girl now?
- Mount Pleasant Cemetery.

21:00.139 --> 21:02.606
She killed herself
two years ago.

21:02.674 --> 21:05.776
[Dev]: She left behind
a sister, Jenny Lawrence.

21:05.844 --> 21:08.946
Beyond the high school connection, what's
the link between Samantha and Jade?

21:09.014 --> 21:11.148
I scoured the internet,
and I couldn't find one.

21:11.216 --> 21:13.417
What, with all the ink spilled
on Jade, there's no mention

21:13.485 --> 21:16.220
- of Samantha?
- She died before Jade was Jade.

21:16.288 --> 21:19.890
Dev, why don't you go visit JC? He's
known these girls for a long time.

21:19.957 --> 21:22.792
You and I will go visit
Samantha's parents.

21:22.860 --> 21:26.963
Look, Sam was a sweet kid.
Talented too.

21:27.031 --> 21:29.032
As a matter of fact,
she's the one who wrote the hook

21:29.100 --> 21:31.601
for "You Killed Me".
They were real tight.

21:31.668 --> 21:33.636
Jade just outgrew her.

21:33.704 --> 21:36.505
Didn't need her anymore,
so I showed her the door.

21:36.572 --> 21:39.775
- And months later she took her own life.
- And I feel bad about that.

21:39.842 --> 21:41.443
And so does Jade.

21:41.511 --> 21:43.845
She blames herself
for Sam's death.

21:43.914 --> 21:46.815
As a matter of fact, a lot
of other people blame Jade too.

21:46.883 --> 21:49.584
Especially her sister, Jenny.

21:49.652 --> 21:53.454
JC, we're late
for the studio, man.

21:53.522 --> 21:55.456
Matter of fact...

21:55.524 --> 21:57.691
security told me

21:57.759 --> 22:00.194
they seen Jenny Lawrence try
to hang out in the studio.

22:00.262 --> 22:02.897
She tired to talk to Jade,
but they didn't let her in.

22:02.965 --> 22:06.199
- And when was this, exactly?
- The day before Bodie died.

22:06.267 --> 22:09.436
I didn't think about it before,
but I thought I'd mention it.

22:09.503 --> 22:12.005
(Vehicle starting)

22:14.976 --> 22:18.278
We have struggled
to understand why...

22:18.346 --> 22:21.848
Sammy would chose
to end her life.

22:21.916 --> 22:24.350
Well, it's our understanding
she had a falling out with Jade.

22:24.418 --> 22:26.518
Do you think that might have
something to do with it?

22:26.586 --> 22:29.455
We lost our girl.
That's all we know.

22:29.522 --> 22:31.723
Have you seen Jade recently?

22:31.791 --> 22:33.960
- She wouldn't dare come here.
- Bill.

22:37.164 --> 22:41.699
The last time we saw her was the
afternoon of Sammy's funeral.

22:41.767 --> 22:45.470
She came by the house
to pay her respects.

22:45.537 --> 22:48.006
She probably shouldn't
have come.

22:48.074 --> 22:50.675
Jenny attacked her.

22:50.742 --> 22:53.111
Where is Jenny now?

22:53.179 --> 22:55.879
She's travelling.

22:55.947 --> 22:58.715
She sends me...

22:58.783 --> 23:02.252
an email every once in a while
to let me know she's all right.

23:02.320 --> 23:05.655
She just needs some time
to get herself sorted out.

23:05.723 --> 23:08.192
I-I wish she would
let me help her.

23:08.259 --> 23:10.593
We need to speak to her
about a homicide

23:10.660 --> 23:12.561
that happened
at Jade's rehearsal studio.

23:12.629 --> 23:14.530
You think Jenny had something
to do with this?

23:14.598 --> 23:17.800
Those people took one of our daughters;
now you're coming after the other?

23:17.868 --> 23:20.136
Mr. Lawrence, do you mind
if I ask you what you do?

23:20.204 --> 23:22.638
Uh... home renovations.

23:22.706 --> 23:25.674
Bathroom, kitchen--
a little bit of everything.

23:25.742 --> 23:28.776
- Electrical?
- Yeah, full service. Why?

23:28.844 --> 23:31.480
I was just curious.
Thank you.

23:36.019 --> 23:38.487
You know, if Bill knows his way
around electrical work,

23:38.554 --> 23:41.956
- he could have wired that mic.
- Yeah, or he could have taught Jenny.

23:42.024 --> 23:44.492
Either way,
we have two viable suspects.

23:44.559 --> 23:48.262
We'll get surveillance on Bill. Dev and I
will do whatever we can to track Jenny down.

23:48.330 --> 23:50.831
If she is having some kind
of emotional breakdown,

23:50.899 --> 23:54.735
- who knows what she's capable of?
- All right, I'm gonna get back to the studio.

23:54.802 --> 23:56.904
Yeah, good.
Hey, listen.

23:56.971 --> 24:00.507
I saw how Jade is, but try to get her
talking about Jenny if you can, OK?

24:00.574 --> 24:03.776
I'll try. I'm having a hard time
getting through to her, though.

24:05.779 --> 24:08.048
Why you always gotta be
so difficult, huh?

24:08.115 --> 24:10.083
Every time I disagree
you say I'm being difficult,

24:10.151 --> 24:12.252
when all I'm saying is I want
to try some different things.

24:12.319 --> 24:15.587
And all I'm saying is
different don't sell!

24:15.655 --> 24:18.490
It's like I'm talking
to a wall with you, man.

24:20.460 --> 24:21.993
OK.

24:33.472 --> 24:35.073
Thanks for the juice.

24:35.140 --> 24:37.308
It's just part of my job.

24:37.376 --> 24:39.911
And how's that working out?

24:39.979 --> 24:43.882
I've got this totally
obnoxious boss.

24:46.618 --> 24:50.588
I'm not really like that, you know. It's
just easier if people think I'm a bitch.

24:50.655 --> 24:52.723
You gotta be careful,

24:52.791 --> 24:56.259
'cause if you keep pushing people
away, no one's ever gonna get in.

24:56.327 --> 24:58.228
Yeah, well,
it's safer that way.

24:58.296 --> 25:00.230
Safe?

25:00.298 --> 25:02.265
Safe is boring.

25:02.333 --> 25:05.234
Yeah. You know, I get it.
You want to be alone.

25:05.302 --> 25:08.337
But I don't think you want
to be lonely.

25:08.405 --> 25:10.707
Well, I have been known,

25:10.774 --> 25:14.276
you know, to open up
for the right person.

25:14.344 --> 25:16.846
Like Samantha.

25:18.815 --> 25:21.683
Look, uh, I know you don't like
talking about her, but we think

25:21.751 --> 25:25.621
that her death might be connected
to the threat on your life, and...

25:25.688 --> 25:28.924
her sister Jenny and her father
might be involved in this as well.

25:28.992 --> 25:31.793
Is that right?

25:31.861 --> 25:33.996
Look, I know
that she attacked you

25:34.063 --> 25:36.664
after the funeral.

25:36.732 --> 25:39.566
And she's a suspect
in Bodie's murder.

25:39.635 --> 25:42.837
And we think that she might be
trying to hurt you.

25:42.904 --> 25:45.305
We need to find her, Jade.

25:45.373 --> 25:49.209
Well, I know she came by
the studio looking for me,

25:49.277 --> 25:52.012
and security sent her away.
That's what I know.

25:52.079 --> 25:54.714
That's...
that's all I know.

25:54.782 --> 25:57.917
OK. I'm here for you,
all right?

25:57.985 --> 26:01.821
If you need help--whatever.
I'm on your side.

26:06.761 --> 26:08.827
You want to know
what would help?

26:08.895 --> 26:11.364
♪ Yo, we're too melodic
for the Philharmonic ♪

26:11.431 --> 26:14.433
♪ It's narcotic,

Thanks.
Cleared the cobwebs.

26:35.788 --> 26:38.557
All right, OK,
I'm glad I could help.

26:38.624 --> 26:41.258
Oh, gosh.

26:41.326 --> 26:42.560
You all right?

26:42.627 --> 26:45.496
Nah. Blood sugar crash.

26:47.666 --> 26:49.800
What are you gonna feed me?

26:51.769 --> 26:54.104
OK, um...

26:54.172 --> 26:56.539
All right, this is crazy,
but I live nearby.

26:56.607 --> 27:00.443
I've got beer in the fridge, and an
awesome pizza joint that delivers.

27:00.511 --> 27:04.247
Well, you had me
at "this is crazy".

27:04.315 --> 27:07.650
Um, yeah. My place is
a little messy.

27:07.718 --> 27:10.820
No, it's cool.
I really love it.

27:10.887 --> 27:13.121
Phew...
What is this?

27:13.189 --> 27:15.290
A friend of mine had
a place like this.

27:15.358 --> 27:17.292
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

27:17.360 --> 27:20.361
- Samantha.
- Oh. Huh.

27:22.397 --> 27:25.499
Personal detail. You must be
starting to like me. Be careful.

27:25.567 --> 27:28.769
- Don't get cute, Logan.
- ♪ I'm gonna dance all night! ♪

27:28.837 --> 27:30.804

27:30.872 --> 27:33.974

27:39.179 --> 27:40.447
Hi.

27:40.514 --> 27:42.249
Hey! Oh, my God. Hey.

27:42.316 --> 27:44.718
- It's Jade.
- Yeah.

27:44.785 --> 27:48.187
- Towel.
- Yeah, towel fell on floor.

27:50.557 --> 27:53.459
- Big fan. - Thanks.
- I bought it;

27:53.526 --> 27:56.495
I didn't download it illegally,
so... OK.

27:58.465 --> 28:01.500
Well, I'm really sorry
that you saw that.

28:01.568 --> 28:05.203
Me too.

28:05.272 --> 28:08.939
So, this guy had eaten maybe a hundred hotdogs
before we got him into the ambulance.

28:09.007 --> 28:10.975
And Toby--
while driving, mind you--

28:11.042 --> 28:13.578
- just starts dry heaving--
- Ohh, what time is it, hey?

28:13.646 --> 28:16.013
- You're late for your shift.
- Oh, yeah. I am so, so late.

28:16.081 --> 28:18.349
But how often do I get a chance

28:18.417 --> 28:20.785
to sit in audience
with such a beautiful,

28:20.852 --> 28:23.853
talented singer, who, I think, quite
frankly, is subverting the genre

28:23.921 --> 28:26.022
that you are doing so well.
What do you think about that?

28:26.090 --> 28:29.326
Yeah, that's... true, Oz.
You don't want to be late.

28:29.394 --> 28:31.728
All right, I'm gonna go.
Hey, next time you see me,

28:31.796 --> 28:34.498
- I will be wearing pants.
- Nice meeting you.

28:34.565 --> 28:36.667
Unless... you know,
you play your cards right.

28:36.734 --> 28:38.201
See you later, buddy.

28:38.269 --> 28:40.003
That's my best friend, Oz.

28:40.070 --> 28:42.071
You're lucky.

28:42.139 --> 28:45.041
Well, yeah, I mean, you saw him, right?
You met him?

28:45.109 --> 28:47.043
- Trust me.
- Talking about the same guy?

28:47.111 --> 28:49.846
Yeah. You're lucky to have
someone who likes you for you.

28:49.914 --> 28:53.349
I mean, everyone in my world
wants something from me.

28:53.417 --> 28:55.851
I'm not complaining, but...

28:55.919 --> 28:57.552
It's lonely.

28:57.620 --> 28:59.554
I mean, there's gotta be--
come on, there's someone

28:59.622 --> 29:02.424
you talk to,
you hang out with, what?

29:02.491 --> 29:06.461
Yeah, um,
I used to talk to Bodie,

29:06.529 --> 29:10.632
and look what happened to him.
I mean, it's my fault he died.

29:13.035 --> 29:15.069
He's not the first.

29:15.137 --> 29:18.105
No, you can't blame yourself
for Samantha's death.

29:23.378 --> 29:25.146
You guys had a deep connection.

29:25.214 --> 29:29.282
Sam, she was special.

29:29.350 --> 29:34.087
She sent me off on this musical
journey, and then JC came in,

29:34.155 --> 29:39.326
and things really got messed up.
He turned me against her.

29:39.393 --> 29:41.794
Divide and conquer--
that's his game.

29:45.631 --> 29:51.136
Look, I recorded an album's
worth of demos by myself.

29:51.204 --> 29:53.138
- Good.
- Yeah, they're pretty hot.

29:53.206 --> 29:55.908
- Yeah?
- I've been shopping them around

29:55.976 --> 29:59.244
without JC.
I'm thinking about leaving.

29:59.311 --> 30:02.446
Really? You sure
that's what you want to do?

30:02.514 --> 30:06.084
I think so.
I don't know.

30:06.151 --> 30:08.452
I mean, he got me
where I am today.

30:08.520 --> 30:10.488
No, no, no.
For the record,

30:10.555 --> 30:12.456
I think you got yourself
where you are today.

30:12.524 --> 30:14.725
I think JC and everyone else had
nothing to do with this.

30:14.793 --> 30:16.793
I mean, it's you
up on stage, right?

30:16.861 --> 30:20.530
You gotta give yourself
a little bit of credit here.

30:26.004 --> 30:29.055
- It's late.
- Yeah, I'll get you home.

30:35.279 --> 30:36.979
Hey!

30:39.849 --> 30:42.451
(Tires screeching)

30:42.519 --> 30:45.554
- You OK?
- Mm-hmm.

30:47.681 --> 30:50.282
(Siren)

30:50.350 --> 30:52.351
- Hey.
- Hey.

30:52.419 --> 30:54.819
So, you're sure
you didn't see the driver?

30:54.887 --> 30:56.955
Yeah. How's Jade?

30:57.023 --> 30:59.958
EMS checked her out. She's OK. I
sent her home with a police guard.

31:00.026 --> 31:04.128
Good.
(Phone ringing)

31:04.196 --> 31:05.730
Yeah.

31:07.700 --> 31:08.666
Yeah, OK.

31:08.733 --> 31:11.101
Great.

31:11.169 --> 31:15.138
So, uniforms found the car
abandoned a few kilometres away.

31:15.206 --> 31:18.208
Guess who it's registered to.

31:18.276 --> 31:21.344
- We're gonna need to see the car.
- We don't have it.

31:21.412 --> 31:25.181
- So where is it?
- We gave that to Jenny a long time ago.

31:25.248 --> 31:27.650
It was just used in a hit
and run attempt on Jade.

31:27.718 --> 31:30.687
That's insane.
Our girl is not a killer.

31:30.754 --> 31:33.022
I will not allow you
to persecute her.

31:33.090 --> 31:35.959
Mr. Lawrence, look, I know you're trying to
protect Jenny, but if you know where she is--

31:36.026 --> 31:39.062
I told you. Jenny went off
to be by herself.

31:39.129 --> 31:41.196
We don't have the slightest idea
where she is.

31:48.270 --> 31:50.205
We're good.

31:50.272 --> 31:52.540
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

31:55.578 --> 31:59.179
He's helping Jenny hide out.
She's renting a room somewhere.

31:59.247 --> 32:01.816
I don't think
Christine knows this. I saw a...

32:01.883 --> 32:04.852
a green awning, a wolf
with a green jack on it.

32:04.920 --> 32:07.187
OK, that might be enough
for us to track her down.

32:07.255 --> 32:10.124
Why don't you go home,
get some rest?

32:10.191 --> 32:12.759
Actually,
I'm going to MuchMusic.

32:12.827 --> 32:15.996
Jade is performing in a few
hours, and I'm gonna be there.

32:16.063 --> 32:18.999
Yeah? Look who's come around
to Jade after all.

32:19.066 --> 32:21.167
You're very invested in this.

32:21.235 --> 32:23.469
Yeah, you know,
I'm just doing my job.

32:23.537 --> 32:25.471
Opinions change, by the way.

32:25.539 --> 32:27.273
All right.

32:27.341 --> 32:31.276
(Crowd chanting "Jade!")

32:34.213 --> 32:35.748
Hey.

32:37.884 --> 32:41.086
- Jade.
- Hey, superhero.

32:41.154 --> 32:44.023
Cape at the cleaner's?

32:44.090 --> 32:46.624
Can you guys give us a minute?

32:46.692 --> 32:48.693
Thanks.

32:48.761 --> 32:51.829
So, I have some news.
I spoke to my lawyers,

32:51.897 --> 32:53.998
and I'm putting the wheels
into motion.

32:54.066 --> 32:58.602
- You're leaving JC. - Well, he doesn't 
know yet. I want to tell him personally.

32:58.671 --> 33:03.373
- How do you feel? - Guilty. 
But I need to stand on my own two feet.

33:03.440 --> 33:05.475
You helped me see that.

33:07.478 --> 33:11.214
- You ready to rock the house?
- Oh, yeah.

Thank you!

34:51.509 --> 34:54.678
We're going to a quick break,
<i>and Jade will be right back</i>

34:54.746 --> 34:56.880
<i>to sing another one</i>
<i>for you guys.</i>

35:00.317 --> 35:02.351
What's this?

35:07.391 --> 35:12.127
She's tracked all of Jade's
movements over the last week.

35:14.130 --> 35:16.131
Let's go.

35:16.199 --> 35:19.434
(Tires screeching)

35:19.502 --> 35:22.236
Toby, we think Jenny's gonna make
her move at the Much Music event.

35:22.305 --> 35:24.939
- OK, I'll cancel the show.
- Hold on. Jenny might be

35:25.007 --> 35:27.442
in the crowd. It could be
the perfect chance to get her.

35:27.510 --> 35:30.645
OK. Look, I'm gonna feel a lot better,
though, if I get Jade out of here.

35:30.713 --> 35:32.646
Fine. Send her home,
but don't let word get out.

35:32.714 --> 35:34.981
It'll give us time to search.
We're on our way.

35:43.358 --> 35:45.326
[Girl]: We love you, Jade!

35:45.393 --> 35:46.893
Hey, Jade.

35:46.961 --> 35:48.895
Jade, I gotta get you
out of here, all right?

35:48.963 --> 35:50.964
- What's wrong?
- I'll explain everything later.

35:51.032 --> 35:54.767
We're gonna get the driver and drive you home.
Trust me on this, please.

35:54.836 --> 35:57.570
- Let's go.
- You're bailing after one song?

35:57.638 --> 36:00.273
- I'm sending her home, JC.
- What? So you don't bother

36:00.341 --> 36:02.275
to ask before you walk
off of a televised show?

36:02.343 --> 36:04.910
There was no time.
Toby said we need to go.

36:04.978 --> 36:08.013
- So he calls the shots now, huh?
- You know what?

36:08.081 --> 36:11.616
I can't deal with your drama
anymore. Sorry. I'm done.

36:11.684 --> 36:15.087
So, what, you don't need me anymore, huh?
Who got you the private plane, huh?

36:15.155 --> 36:19.458
- Who got you the platinum records, huh?
- I did. Our day is over.

36:19.525 --> 36:22.327
Get your hands off me, man.
I pay you.

36:22.394 --> 36:26.097
- You done, JC?
- Yeah, I am done. <i>And she's done too.</i>

36:26.165 --> 36:29.033
<i>I'll make sure of that.</i>

36:36.575 --> 36:39.509
Hey, Michelle,
we've got a problem here.

36:42.836 --> 36:46.773
We need to issue an APB: black
limousine, marker BAOK 736.

36:46.840 --> 36:49.241
- Advise IIB if spotted.
<i>- Copy that.</i>

36:49.309 --> 36:52.077
- You sure about this? - Yeah, JC's up
to something. I'm not sure exactly what,

36:52.145 --> 36:54.947
- but I know she's in danger.
- It's not Jenny?

36:55.015 --> 36:57.416
I don't know.
I just know we gotta find her.

36:57.483 --> 37:01.386
<i>Be advised: police unit has a visual on a black
limousine, marker Bravo Alpha Oscar Kilo</i>

37:01.454 --> 37:04.723
736. Vehicle is making the turn
<i>off Richmond onto Draper.</i>

37:04.791 --> 37:06.825
That's near Jade's house.

37:15.934 --> 37:18.702
You don't need
to walk me inside.

37:18.770 --> 37:21.639
JC told me
to keep an eye on you.

37:21.706 --> 37:23.974
Well, it doesn't really matter
what JC says anymore.

37:27.879 --> 37:30.580
(Gunshot)

37:30.648 --> 37:32.148
What are you doing?!

37:34.952 --> 37:36.653
Go that way.

37:43.226 --> 37:45.160
[Man]: Don't hide from me!

37:45.227 --> 37:47.763
(Jade gasping in fear)

37:52.802 --> 37:55.003
- Stop!
- Ah!

37:55.071 --> 37:58.173
IIB! Drop your weapon!

37:58.240 --> 38:02.009
- Stay back!
- Just shoot him!

38:02.077 --> 38:06.013
- Nobody wants to shoot anyone.
- Walk away. Walk away or she's dead.

38:08.851 --> 38:12.353
She's gonna break left,
Michelle.

38:12.420 --> 38:14.655
(Gunshot)

38:14.723 --> 38:16.523
Ugh!

38:16.591 --> 38:18.892
Dev, get an ambulance
to 145 Draper.

38:25.900 --> 38:27.601
He's gone.

38:37.343 --> 38:38.811
Michelle.

38:38.879 --> 38:41.947
- About the shooting...
- I've talked to SIU.

38:42.015 --> 38:44.917
No, that's not what I'm asking.
I want to know you're OK.

38:44.985 --> 38:47.520
- I'm fine.
- OK.

38:47.587 --> 38:51.756
Leon Quint:
part-time driver,

38:51.824 --> 38:55.026
- part-time muscle for JC's organization.
- No criminal record,

38:55.093 --> 38:57.061
but he had a reputation
as a fixer.

38:57.129 --> 38:59.030
We searched his apartment.
We found red paint,

38:59.097 --> 39:01.533
hybridized cable,
and the keys to Jenny's car.

39:01.600 --> 39:04.701
Yeah, he's responsible for Bodie's death,
and he tried to frame Rodney Squires.

39:04.769 --> 39:07.004
When that didn't work out
as planned, he switched gears.

39:07.071 --> 39:09.039
He knew Jenny was
hanging around.

39:09.106 --> 39:11.141
He must have gotten the idea
to frame her.

39:11.208 --> 39:13.810
In reality, Jenny was just laying
low, trying to sort herself out.

39:13.878 --> 39:16.813
Yeah, she was
the perfect fallback.

39:16.881 --> 39:20.083
She had every reason to want revenge on Jade.
It's like the story writes itself.

39:20.151 --> 39:24.253
Just one problem: how to tie
the whole thing to JC.

39:24.320 --> 39:27.322
<i>Look, look,</i>
<i>when I met Sasha Dixon</i>

39:27.390 --> 39:30.927
<i>she was a pop emo kid</i>
<i>in a nowhere band.</i>

39:30.994 --> 39:33.429
Well, this is
your management contract.

39:33.496 --> 39:36.432
It states: in the event of Jade's
death, you control everything--

39:36.499 --> 39:38.433
recordings, publishing,
merchandising.

39:38.500 --> 39:40.902
You knew she was shopping
a new CD behind your back.

39:40.970 --> 39:43.939
- I knew nothing about no new CD!
- Oh, that's a lie.

39:44.006 --> 39:46.074
We have a sworn testimony
from an A&R guy

39:46.141 --> 39:49.044
- who says you threatened him to get you a copy.
- You heard it,

39:49.111 --> 39:51.312
you knew it was
gonna be massive.

39:51.380 --> 39:55.082
But what pissed you off was not the fact
that she was gonna walk away with that CD;

39:55.149 --> 39:57.985
it was that she did
her best work without you.

39:58.053 --> 40:00.854
- Oh, my goodness.
- Whoa, whoa, even if any of this is true--

40:00.922 --> 40:04.091
and I assure you none of it is--
you don't have a lick of evidence.

40:04.158 --> 40:08.261
Quint received a deposit
of $250,000.

40:08.329 --> 40:11.297
That's a big-time salary
for a part-time limo driver.

40:11.364 --> 40:16.002
We were able to link that back to a numbered
account held by an LLC in the Caymans.

40:16.070 --> 40:18.671
Belonging to one Jason Coleman,

40:18.739 --> 40:20.773
AKA JC.

40:27.279 --> 40:31.516
- Oz? Hey! - Yeah, I'm right here.
- Good. OK, get your clothes on.

40:31.584 --> 40:33.785
I just wanted to make sure
we didn't see Little Oz again.

40:33.853 --> 40:36.554
Little Oz? Jade didn't
call it that, did she?

40:36.623 --> 40:39.691
It's OK. Don't worry about it. Forget it.
She was complimentary.

40:39.759 --> 40:43.293
- How goes the apartment hunting?
- My eyes are too big for my bank account.

40:43.361 --> 40:46.530
It's never gonna happen.
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

40:46.598 --> 40:48.032
What is that?

40:48.100 --> 40:50.300
These are the keys
for the apartment down the hall.

40:50.368 --> 40:52.737
I talked to the landlady.
It's yours for a grand a month.

40:52.804 --> 40:54.639
We'd be neighbours?

40:54.706 --> 40:56.373
- Yeah.
- That'd be awesome.

40:56.441 --> 40:59.009
But you can't do
my heavy lifting for me anymore.

40:59.076 --> 41:01.811
Look, part of being a grown-ass man is
knowing when to accept a helping hand.

41:01.879 --> 41:03.412
Take 'em.

41:05.982 --> 41:07.449
This is awesome.

41:07.517 --> 41:11.186
(Knocking at door) She's here.

41:11.254 --> 41:14.523
- You knew she was coming?
- No. What are you doing here?

41:14.590 --> 41:17.459
Hi. I probably should have
called first, but, uh,

41:17.527 --> 41:20.995
- where's the fun in that?
- Don't know. Hey, come on into the kitchen.

41:21.063 --> 41:24.098
- You remember Oz.
- Yes, nice to see you again--

41:24.166 --> 41:28.502
- with pants. - Well, uh, Toby instituted 
a new policy in the apartment.

41:28.570 --> 41:31.372
It's a little restrictive
to my freedom, but, uh...

41:34.043 --> 41:35.976
You know, I should go check out
my new apartment!

41:36.044 --> 41:38.344
- That's what I should do.
- That's a great idea.

41:38.412 --> 41:40.313
Then I would be...
Nice to see you.

41:40.381 --> 41:42.615
- Nice to see you.
- Great.

41:42.684 --> 41:46.286
- So, what's going on? - I spoke to Jenny last night.
- Good. And how's she doing?

41:46.353 --> 41:49.455
Her parents are taking good care of her.
I think she's gonna be OK.

41:49.523 --> 41:51.524
That's great. And you guys
talked about Samantha?

41:51.592 --> 41:54.359
Yeah, she got some stuff
off her chest.

41:54.427 --> 41:57.596
It'll take awhile, but I think I'm
gonna try to get right with her.

41:57.664 --> 42:02.301
- That's great.
- Yeah. So, uh... my tour's starting next week.

42:02.368 --> 42:05.537
- Eighteen months around the world.
- When you come to Toronto,

42:05.605 --> 42:09.607
we want backstage passes--
Oz... would really be grateful.

42:09.675 --> 42:12.276
- Toby.
- What?

42:12.344 --> 42:15.013
I'm surrounded by people
who aren't real,

42:15.081 --> 42:18.016
so it's nice
to know someone who is.

42:18.084 --> 42:21.352
Maybe when I'm back
we could, uh...

42:21.420 --> 42:23.821
- grab a coffee?
- That'd be great.

42:23.888 --> 42:25.956
You know where I live.

42:26.024 --> 42:29.459
Well, till next time.
