Lip?

10:20.370 --> 10:22.914

There is no Lip Gallagher
on my class list.

10:26.626 --> 10:28.795
Right, no, yeah,
there was a slight hiccup

10:28.795 --> 10:30.673
with financial aid.

10:30.673 --> 10:33.258
Uh, but, you know, I wanted
to hit the ground running

10:33.258 --> 10:34.676
for when it gets sorted out.

10:34.676 --> 10:36.011
And you're interested
in Critical Theory

10:36.011 --> 10:37.220
and Postmodern Thought?

10:37.220 --> 10:38.847
Absolutely, yeah.

10:38.847 --> 10:41.641
Yeah, you know, and also
a lot of the other classes

10:41.641 --> 10:44.978
were already full,
so it was between this

10:44.978 --> 10:46.438
and Environmental Studies.

And hippies don't use
deodorant, so...

10:49.608 --> 10:52.652

what Critical Theory is?

in a nutshell.

the way they are.

11:00.870 --> 11:02.662

be different.

doing everything he can

11:43.788 --> 11:45.664

thrown at him.

11:45.664 --> 11:47.290

listened to anyone? Ever?

11:51.378 --> 11:52.838

your brother you trust him

11:52.838 --> 11:54.464

Bombs away.

29:47.745 --> 29:49.956
Hey, need some help?

29:49.956 --> 29:51.498
You know how
to use an iron?

29:51.498 --> 29:52.876
Yeah.

29:52.876 --> 29:53.918
I mean, as a weapon.

29:53.918 --> 29:55.252
[scoffs]

29:58.505 --> 30:00.382
When I woke up
this morning,

30:00.382 --> 30:03.970
this is not how
I saw my day ending.

30:03.970 --> 30:08.557
With a derelict
getting stoned.

30:08.557 --> 30:11.310
Derelict.

30:11.310 --> 30:13.812
Is that offensive?

30:13.812 --> 30:15.397
I've been called worse.

30:15.397 --> 30:17.816
[chuckles]

30:17.816 --> 30:21.946
[laughing]
What am I doing here?

30:21.946 --> 30:24.240
[phone rings]

30:24.240 --> 30:25.950
Your family again?

30:25.950 --> 30:28.035
Ugh, oncologist.

30:28.035 --> 30:31.247
Probably wants
to schedule my surgery. Chemo.

30:31.247 --> 30:34.041
2% chance is better
than nothing.

30:34.041 --> 30:37.586
I saw it during my residency
countless times.

30:37.586 --> 30:40.048
Patients enduring
round after round

30:40.048 --> 30:41.966
of poison
pumped into their systems,

30:41.966 --> 30:43.842
so they can spend
what days they have left

30:43.842 --> 30:47.638
by the toilet,
puking and bald.

30:47.638 --> 30:49.265
Not me.

30:49.265 --> 30:51.475
I'm going out
with a bang,

30:51.475 --> 30:53.060
not a whimper.

30:53.060 --> 30:56.397
[phone rings]

30:58.899 --> 31:01.860
[laughter]

31:05.031 --> 31:07.033
You believe in God,
Frank?

31:07.033 --> 31:09.953
I believe in a force

31:09.953 --> 31:13.205
that thinks it's greater
than myself.

31:13.205 --> 31:17.251
Hell, I survived this.

31:17.251 --> 31:20.004
Doctors had one eye
on the clock.

31:20.004 --> 31:23.007
Waiting to punch
the time of death.

31:25.301 --> 31:29.013
Those times you almost died,

31:29.013 --> 31:31.432
was it peaceful
or scary or--

31:31.432 --> 31:33.809
What's peaceful
about dying?

31:33.809 --> 31:36.020
I don't care how much
they meditate--

31:36.020 --> 31:37.062
when the time comes,

31:37.062 --> 31:39.065
those Hindus will be
shitting their pants

31:39.065 --> 31:41.067
just like the rest of us.

31:41.067 --> 31:42.901
You know what
they'll be thinking?

31:42.901 --> 31:45.738
"Fuck, I wish
I'd tried steak."

31:45.738 --> 31:48.907
[laughs]

31:48.907 --> 31:50.284
What, Doc?

31:50.284 --> 31:51.660
Ahh.

31:51.660 --> 31:54.038
My name's Bianca.

31:58.959 --> 32:00.461
You ever streak before?

32:00.461 --> 32:02.005
Many times.

32:02.005 --> 32:03.172
Just never on purpose.

32:03.172 --> 32:05.632
Oh, well, come on.

32:05.632 --> 32:07.843
[laughs]

32:07.843 --> 32:10.096
Oh...
[mutters]

32:10.096 --> 32:11.889
Jesus.

32:11.889 --> 32:14.391
God, this is
gonna be difficult.

32:14.391 --> 32:15.976
Fuck.

32:15.976 --> 32:18.228
Whoo!

32:18.228 --> 32:19.313
Whoo!

32:19.313 --> 32:21.023
I'm coming.
Ah!

32:21.023 --> 32:23.109
I'm coming.

32:23.109 --> 32:24.902
I can't do this.

32:24.902 --> 32:27.946
Yeah, here I come.

32:30.074 --> 32:31.742
Yo.

32:31.742 --> 32:33.118
I'm off
to the courthouse today

32:33.118 --> 32:34.953
to watch my brother
get sent up the river.

32:34.953 --> 32:36.372
Did you have another late night
at the sorority?

32:36.372 --> 32:38.707
No, man,
no time to party.

32:38.707 --> 32:40.959
I had three Rapewalker calls
overnight.

32:40.959 --> 32:42.378
[groans]

32:42.378 --> 32:46.507
Coeds wanting me to escort
my penis into their vaginas.

32:46.507 --> 32:47.966
My balls haven't been
this exhausted

32:47.966 --> 32:51.512
since I discovered jacking off
when I was nine years old.

32:51.512 --> 32:53.138
Thought you weren't
gonna bang those coeds.

32:53.138 --> 32:54.515
Yeah, drunk ones.

32:54.515 --> 32:56.016
These are sober
and horny.

32:56.016 --> 32:57.768
I mean, why deny them
their God-given right

32:57.768 --> 32:58.977
to multiple orgasms?

32:58.977 --> 33:01.188
- What about V?
- What about V?

33:01.188 --> 33:03.024
You know, I can't think
about that right now.

33:03.024 --> 33:04.900
She's doing her thing.
I'm doing my thing.

33:04.900 --> 33:07.528
It was her decision.

33:07.528 --> 33:10.656
You still, uh, banging
that Asian chick?

33:10.656 --> 33:13.117
Off and on.

33:13.117 --> 33:14.868
Went down
on my professor though.

33:14.868 --> 33:17.454
Oh, what's his name?

33:17.454 --> 33:19.207
You take his whole dick
in your mouth?

33:19.207 --> 33:21.166
It's, uh, Helene.

33:21.166 --> 33:22.751
You know, she knows
what she wants.

33:22.751 --> 33:23.961
She doesn't second-guess
herself.

33:23.961 --> 33:25.504
It's really sexy.

33:25.504 --> 33:27.965
Ohh, there's no substitute
for experience.

33:27.965 --> 33:29.174
- Yeah.
- What? She wear you out?

33:29.174 --> 33:30.342
You look fucking tired.

33:30.342 --> 33:31.635
No, no, no, no.

33:31.635 --> 33:34.222
I was up at the computer lab
all night.

33:34.222 --> 33:36.515
I was trying to hack
into Financial Aid.

33:36.515 --> 33:38.225
Security system was
too good though.

33:38.225 --> 33:39.518
I couldn't do it.

33:39.518 --> 33:41.019
[phone ringing]

33:41.019 --> 33:43.313
[groans]

33:43.313 --> 33:45.732
Well, duty calls.

33:45.732 --> 33:48.152
Yeah, Rapewalker,
at your service.

33:54.992 --> 33:57.161
Whoa, you okay?

33:57.161 --> 33:58.162
Who roughed you up?

33:58.162 --> 33:59.371
Skanky Sammi.

33:59.371 --> 34:00.998
She got me by surprise.

34:00.998 --> 34:02.082
Still got
a few uppercuts in.

34:02.082 --> 34:03.125
Nice.

34:03.125 --> 34:06.044
Here,
your groveling ensemble.

34:06.044 --> 34:07.171
Shit, I'm not wearing that.

34:07.171 --> 34:08.714
It's not up for discussion.

34:08.714 --> 34:10.757
You're gonna dress like
a fucking law-abiding citizen

34:10.757 --> 34:12.218
whether you like it
or not.

34:12.218 --> 34:14.011
And here, this too.

34:14.011 --> 34:16.221
I grabbed them
from the Lost and Found at work.

34:16.221 --> 34:18.223
It's a weak prescription.
You'll be fine.

34:18.223 --> 34:20.851
How stupid do I look?

34:24.605 --> 34:27.233
Jesus, I wanna kick
my own ass.

34:34.198 --> 34:36.658
(Bianca)
Fuck you!

34:36.658 --> 34:41.288
I'm 32!
I was just getting started!

34:41.288 --> 34:42.623
[crying]

34:42.623 --> 34:45.834
Fuck you, pancreas.
Fuck you, cells.

34:45.834 --> 34:47.252
Fuck you, med school.

34:47.252 --> 34:50.506
Fuck you!

35:00.141 --> 35:02.434
[chuckling]

35:06.772 --> 35:09.149
Something else
I need to do.

35:11.652 --> 35:13.279
You coming?

35:19.368 --> 35:20.786
Hi.

35:20.786 --> 35:23.163
Baby, what happened?

35:23.163 --> 35:25.582
Boys hit me.
Called me rat.

35:25.582 --> 35:26.875
Uncle Carl told them.

35:34.132 --> 35:35.425
Bitch hit Carl.

35:35.425 --> 35:37.303
Looks like he gave
as good as he got.

35:37.303 --> 35:39.680
Hey, uh, V, this thing
with you and Kev,

35:39.680 --> 35:41.473
is it, uh--
is it temporary?

35:41.473 --> 35:43.433
What did he say
when you asked him?

35:43.433 --> 35:46.144
Uh, nothing.

35:46.144 --> 35:47.729
(bailiff)
All rise.

35:47.729 --> 35:49.315
The Circuit Court
of Cook County

35:49.315 --> 35:50.857
is now in session.

35:50.857 --> 35:54.570
The honorable Rita Gaither
is presiding.

35:54.570 --> 35:58.199
Please sit.

35:58.199 --> 36:02.160
Case number 2014-CR-882655.

36:02.160 --> 36:04.830
The People versus
Charles Nevins S.

36:04.830 --> 36:06.665
This is the time and place
for the sentencing hearing.

36:06.665 --> 36:09.167
This court has reviewed
your probation report.

36:09.167 --> 36:11.086
Does other counsel
wish to be heard?

36:11.086 --> 36:13.714
Your Honor,
defense would like to reiterate

36:13.714 --> 36:16.174
that this is
defendant's first arrest.

36:16.174 --> 36:17.759
He has never been
in trouble before

36:17.759 --> 36:23.307
and that he has an IQ of
barely functional intelligence.

36:23.307 --> 36:25.934
Would the defendant
like to say anything?

36:29.438 --> 36:31.315
Charles?

36:31.315 --> 36:34.109
- Chuckie.
- What?

36:34.109 --> 36:36.695
Would you like to say anything
before sentencing?

36:36.695 --> 36:39.323
Okay.

36:43.285 --> 36:46.247
I would, Your Honor.

36:46.247 --> 36:50.334
I'm his mom.
May I speak?

36:50.334 --> 36:53.170
My Chuckie is a good boy.

36:53.170 --> 36:56.214
The only thing
he's ever stolen was my heart.

36:56.214 --> 37:00.177
But he was taken advantage of
by an older family member.

37:00.177 --> 37:03.889
If you're gonna blame anyone,
you should blame his uncle Carl

37:03.889 --> 37:06.892
or the family who raised him

37:06.892 --> 37:09.227
or me,
for putting an innocent boy

37:09.227 --> 37:11.855
in a den of wolves.

37:14.066 --> 37:16.735
Anything else?

37:16.735 --> 37:18.904
Prosecution?

37:18.904 --> 37:21.573
Then we can proceed
to sentencing.

37:21.573 --> 37:24.785
This court hereby
sentences you to a minimum

37:24.785 --> 37:27.913
of 120 days at the Illinois
Department of Corrections

37:27.913 --> 37:29.414
Juvenile Justice Division.

37:29.414 --> 37:31.249
60 days for good behavior.

37:31.249 --> 37:33.043
Oh, he'll behave,
Your Honor.

37:33.043 --> 37:34.462
Right, Chuckie?

37:34.462 --> 37:36.171
Chuckie, nod.

37:36.171 --> 37:38.799
Okay, you're remanded
to the custody of the sheriff.

37:38.799 --> 37:41.427
I'll see you
before you get on the bus.

37:41.427 --> 37:44.596
Don't be scared, baby.

37:44.596 --> 37:46.349
It's gonna be okay, bunny.

37:46.349 --> 37:48.642
Remember,
be nice to the guards.

37:51.978 --> 37:55.982
You have got to be
fucking kidding me.

37:55.982 --> 37:57.485
Well, if I didn't
know better,

37:57.485 --> 37:59.194
I'd think
he's an upstanding young man.

37:59.194 --> 38:00.779
Just like Ted Bundy.

38:00.779 --> 38:03.532
Case number 2014-CR-4929.

38:03.532 --> 38:05.826
The People versus
Carl Francis G.

38:05.826 --> 38:07.828
This is the time and place
for the sentencing hearing.

38:07.828 --> 38:10.330
Court has reviewed
your probation report.

38:10.330 --> 38:12.207
Does other counsel
wish to be heard?

38:12.207 --> 38:14.376
Your Honor, my client knows
that he has made a mistake.

38:14.376 --> 38:16.586
He is sorry
for what he's done,

38:16.586 --> 38:19.172
and he has learned
from the experience.

38:19.172 --> 38:21.007
Do you regret what
you've done, Carl?

38:21.007 --> 38:23.218
I did something
really dumb

38:23.218 --> 38:24.720
that I shouldn't have.

38:24.720 --> 38:28.432
I trusted a fucking retard
with a man's job.

38:28.432 --> 38:31.268
Next time I move a bunch
of drugs, I'll be smarter.

38:31.268 --> 38:32.769
If you want to go
into my chambers and speak

38:32.769 --> 38:36.481
to me off the record,
now is the time.

38:36.481 --> 38:39.609
Otherwise, you will end up
in juvenile prison.

38:39.609 --> 38:42.237
Is that what you want?

38:44.489 --> 38:46.409
Yes, please.

38:46.409 --> 38:48.869
That's not what I was
hoping to hear.

38:48.869 --> 38:50.579
I know what you
were hoping to hear.

38:50.579 --> 38:53.123
If Your Honor
would lose 20 pounds,

38:53.123 --> 38:54.791
I would consider
tapping that.

38:54.791 --> 38:58.462
(Gaither)
I think I've heard enough.

38:58.462 --> 39:00.338
I sentence you to the maximum

39:00.338 --> 39:02.257
of one year at the Illinois
Department of Corrections

39:02.257 --> 39:03.967
Juvenile Justice Division.

39:03.967 --> 39:05.844
You're remanded
to the custody of the sheriff.

39:05.844 --> 39:07.971
This court is in recess.

39:12.768 --> 39:15.061
Why the fuck
did you do that, Carl?

39:15.061 --> 39:16.772
When Paul Sugden came
out of juvie,

39:16.772 --> 39:18.690
he knew how to make IEDs
and where to launder money.

39:18.690 --> 39:20.317
You can't buy
that kind of education.

39:20.317 --> 39:22.569
Plus, my street cred
will be off the chain.

39:22.569 --> 39:26.364
Don't worry,
I'm gonna make juvie my bitch.

39:26.364 --> 39:28.074
We'll send letters.

39:28.074 --> 39:30.368
It was bound to happen
sooner or later.

39:30.368 --> 39:32.204
- He'll be okay.
- Okay?

39:32.204 --> 39:34.414
Hell, he's gonna be
running the joint.

39:34.414 --> 39:36.584
Any chance
he'll get scared straight?

39:36.584 --> 39:37.876
- Hell no.
- No.

39:39.419 --> 39:42.047
[knocks on door]

39:47.344 --> 39:50.055
Can I help you?

39:50.055 --> 39:51.557
Daisy Kelso?

39:51.557 --> 39:53.850
It's Rigby now.
Do I know you?

39:53.850 --> 39:55.143
Who is it, Mommy?

39:55.143 --> 39:56.604
Oh, hi.

39:56.604 --> 39:59.272
- Bianca, is that you?
- Yeah.

39:59.272 --> 40:01.566
My God,
haven't seen you since...

40:01.566 --> 40:03.276
- Prom.
- Yeah.

40:03.276 --> 40:05.153
- How are you?
- Good.

40:05.153 --> 40:06.947
- Now?
- Now.

40:06.947 --> 40:08.031
[screams]

40:08.031 --> 40:10.367
(Frank)
Run, run, run!

40:10.367 --> 40:12.578
[gasping]

40:12.578 --> 40:14.496
Mommy!

40:14.496 --> 40:15.580
Do you think
I broke her nose?

40:15.580 --> 40:17.415
You took out
a tooth for sure.
