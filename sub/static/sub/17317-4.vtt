00:12.190 --> 00:13.750
Tonight - we have
a race to Blackpool.

00:13.750 --> 00:15.271
The new Lamborghini
comes to our studio.

00:17.776 --> 00:21.937
And at last, the Bugatti Veyron
is on our track.

00:29.696 --> 00:31.217
Thank you, thank you. Hello!

00:31.497 --> 00:32.537
Hello and welcome.

00:34.616 --> 00:37.817
Now, every week,
either Richard or I

00:38.057 --> 00:41.616
drive a preposterously fast car
around our track,

00:41.857 --> 00:44.936
but when it came to making this
week's film, there was a problem.

00:45.217 --> 00:47.217
Neither of us was available.

00:47.336 --> 00:49.336
I'd hurt my neck in the lorry crash

00:49.617 --> 00:52.217
and Richard was busy
selling fish at Morrisons.

00:58.657 --> 00:59.816
God help us.

01:06.456 --> 01:11.456
When I arrived,
the track was enveloped
in typical British autumnalness.

01:12.296 --> 01:16.217
Right, here we go. Top Gear
test track. My patch for the day.

01:16.617 --> 01:21.216
I've been very insistent
with the office - I don't want
to find some look-at-me,

01:23.017 --> 01:24.056
two-door, Italian supercar

01:24.457 --> 01:30.256
with a 250mph speedo and a Â£250,000
price tag or any of that rubbish.

01:30.656 --> 01:34.817
I want to drive something
more like, to be honest, some...

01:35.056 --> 01:35.256
Some...

01:36.937 --> 01:37.776
Oh, cock.

01:39.576 --> 01:40.497
Surely not.

01:41.856 --> 01:47.657
Well, since the choice
is testing this or the Panda,
I suppose it had better be this,

01:47.817 --> 01:49.817
which is a Pagani Zonda.

01:50.297 --> 01:52.536
And not just any old Zonda.

01:52.816 --> 01:55.056
That is the Zonda F Roadster.

01:56.536 --> 02:03.896
And in the already insane world
of Pagani, this one
has its own special padded cell.

02:05.617 --> 02:11.456
Regular car - 555 horsepower.
This one - 650. Let's try it out.

02:15.217 --> 02:22.856
This may be my first Zonda,
but it happens to be
the fastest one we've ever tested.

02:23.096 --> 02:25.337
The acceleration is so brutal!

02:27.177 --> 02:33.817
I think my eyes have moved round
the side of my head like a pigeon.

02:34.696 --> 02:39.577
'I think I know what to do
at this point.' Power-r-r-r!

02:46.217 --> 02:50.257
This car is made entirely
out of improbable numbers.

02:52.417 --> 02:58.256
0 to 60 - 3.6 seconds.
0 to 120 - under 10 seconds.

02:58.696 --> 03:02.696
And then, when you hit
the carbon ceramic brakes...

03:07.496 --> 03:10.096
..125mph to 0 in 4.4 seconds.

03:13.016 --> 03:19.937
And my eyeballs
are back in the correct position
on the front of my face.

03:20.337 --> 03:27.217
There is, though, one other number
that dwarfs all of these,
and it's the price.

03:27.217 --> 03:28.056
It's Â£825,000.

03:32.257 --> 03:36.777
Top Gear, bringing you
credit crunch news on the hour.

03:41.617 --> 03:46.376
But we haven't just brought
this along to show you
some high-priced hyper-porn.

03:46.616 --> 03:50.537
You see, the F Roadster is
the swansong for the current Zonda.

03:50.977 --> 03:58.096
Next year, there'll be
a brand-new one, but the original
will always be a bit special to us.

03:58.457 --> 04:01.657
You know when we brought Top Gear
back to the telly in 2002,

04:02.017 --> 04:05.576
the Zonda was the car we featured
in the very first show,

04:05.976 --> 04:09.056
and we liked it, but there was
always that nagging feeling that,

04:09.456 --> 04:13.617
"Here come another bunch
of hopeless optimists who think
they know better than Ferrari.

04:13.976 --> 04:16.096
"Give them a year and they'll be
down the dole office."

04:16.337 --> 04:17.857
But it hasn't happened.

04:18.616 --> 04:24.056
Pagani is still very much here still
today, getting up Ferrari's nose.

04:24.496 --> 04:29.696
Richard Hammond, who is 12,
thinks it's because Pagani
has captured that "mental market" -

04:30.057 --> 04:34.376
the small boy's bedroom wall poster
that used to be a Lamborghini.

04:34.777 --> 04:41.056
It's got ridiculous bodywork and
ray guns and switches from the lunar-
module. And I think he's right.

04:41.336 --> 04:43.337
But there is something else.

04:45.377 --> 04:48.456
It's actually a very, very good car.

04:49.456 --> 04:54.456
See, the entire shell is
made out of naked carbon fibre...

04:55.216 --> 05:00.056
..which makes you look
a bit of an idiot, frankly,
but it does mean it's very strong.

05:00.577 --> 05:04.736
So strong that even when
they've taken the roof off,
it remains perfectly rigid.

05:05.136 --> 05:09.016
In fact,
the construction's so clever
that it hasn't gained any weight

05:09.376 --> 05:13.176
in becoming a convertible,
and that's a rare thing.

05:13.456 --> 05:16.777
The Pagani engineers
do know what they're doing.

05:18.977 --> 05:25.256
Which means we've come to that point-
in the film where I have to go
fast round a corner to prove it.

05:25.417 --> 05:26.576
Turn it in...

05:26.936 --> 05:27.856
TYRES SCREECH

05:34.337 --> 05:36.017
Can we cut that bit out?

05:36.256 --> 05:39.697
With a bit of practice, though,
I did get the hang of it.

05:39.817 --> 05:41.857
Dab of brakes, turn in...

05:43.856 --> 05:44.816
You see?

05:52.336 --> 06:00.296
And I'm told... I mean,
I can report, that the F Roadster
is pretty agile through the corners.

06:00.657 --> 06:03.737
The office say they have another car-
for me to try on the track,

06:04.017 --> 06:08.257
but that I shouldn't worry
because it's only a VW.

06:08.737 --> 06:09.217
Funny(!)

06:17.257 --> 06:20.216
The Bugatti Veyron,
finally on our track,

06:20.617 --> 06:23.936
and I'm gonna put it
straight to work.

06:24.177 --> 06:30.137
I believe the done thing
at this point is to have a drag race,

06:30.377 --> 06:31.457
so if nobody objects, we'll have one.

06:31.696 --> 06:31.937
With these two.

06:32.176 --> 06:34.737
Since I'd got my eye in
with the Zonda, I took that.

06:35.016 --> 06:40.017
The Veyron would be in the hands of
the Stig, who wasn't here earlier.

06:40.256 --> 06:44.337
On paper, this looks like a bit of
a one-horse race, because the Veyron

06:44.696 --> 06:49.936
is a full second quicker than this
car to 60. 2.5 seconds, 3.5 seconds.

06:50.177 --> 06:54.457
But you never know,
he might mess up the start.

06:56.537 --> 06:57.416
He didn't.

06:57.656 --> 06:58.136
Crikey!

07:03.176 --> 07:08.536
Despite weighing over half a ton
more, the Veyron mullered the Zonda.

07:10.817 --> 07:13.417
That is the power of power.

07:14.657 --> 07:19.337
Now, I should really
take that Veyron off Stiggy
and drive it around a few corners,

07:19.696 --> 07:22.737
but unfortunately, that would get
in the way of what you, me

07:23.137 --> 07:25.496
and everybody else in the world
really wants to see,

07:25.736 --> 07:28.577
which is him taking it for a lap.

07:28.856 --> 07:29.537
Oh, yes.

07:35.417 --> 07:36.696
Well done, you.

07:36.977 --> 07:39.497
I wasn't kidding.
I do actually mean it.

07:39.737 --> 07:43.736
Later on in the show,
after a wait of two years... Yeah.

07:44.137 --> 07:49.376
the most powerful car in the world
goes round our track.

07:49.617 --> 07:52.217
It is gonna be quite a moment.
It's gonna be up here somewhere.

07:52.617 --> 07:56.057
But we've already had
quite a moment -
you, for the first time, out there.

07:56.176 --> 07:58.697
How was it? Smooth as silk.

07:59.296 --> 07:59.576
LAUGHTER

08:00.217 --> 08:05.216
It's a piece of cake.
Who here would like to see
some of the out-takes of James...?

08:05.496 --> 08:06.977
AUDIENCE: Yes!
You would?

08:07.817 --> 08:09.857
Let's play the tape somewhere.

08:12.023 --> 08:14.623
Oh dear,
that Chicago has gone wrong.

08:14.743 --> 08:17.102
Here we go again, gone wrong.

08:18.103 --> 08:21.422
And here we go again -
it's gone wrong.

08:21.663 --> 08:21.862
APPLAUSE

08:23.303 --> 08:24.103
Thank you.

08:26.422 --> 08:28.543
He is useless. Useless. What?!

08:29.863 --> 08:32.702
The problem is... Mm?
..it's my hair.

08:33.102 --> 08:36.542
No, it is. When you go through
a corner, it blows in my face.

08:36.903 --> 08:40.943
Yeah. But as soon as I put
that helmet on,
everything was absolutely fine.

08:41.222 --> 08:41.263
LAUGHTER

08:42.741 --> 08:46.903
I think it was that you stepped
out of the Panda, into the Zonda,

08:47.142 --> 08:52.743
which is like weaning a baby off
breast milk and straight onto port.

08:53.143 --> 08:55.942
I can't believe
he got to drive that.

08:56.863 --> 09:01.622
It is my all-time favourite
supercar - it's that mixture of
sheer lunacy and engineering.

09:01.823 --> 09:03.263
You could've driven it.

09:03.662 --> 09:07.423
You were given the choice -
drive the Zonda or sell fish
for a Northern supermarket.

09:07.822 --> 09:12.223
You chose the fish.
You can't seriously prefer
the Zonda to the Bugatti.

09:12.622 --> 09:18.062
I do, because the Zonda's got
some pantomime to it. The Bugatti's-
like sitting in a physics lesson.

09:18.463 --> 09:20.302
Were you watching
that drag race? Yes.

09:20.583 --> 09:25.343
Did you see what the physics lesson-
did to your pantomime dame? Yes.

09:25.863 --> 09:31.303
It annihilated it.
But if we could just listen -
what's that I'm not hearing?

09:31.423 --> 09:33.102
Anyone not hearing that?

09:33.503 --> 09:37.262
Anybody else not hearing
the Zonda being taken round
the track by the Stig?

09:37.663 --> 09:41.223
I wonder if it's got anything to do-
with what happened when it arrived?

09:41.462 --> 09:42.502
Here we go.

09:42.902 --> 09:44.743
First corner,
the very first corner,

09:45.023 --> 09:47.623
and what's that
coming out of the back?

09:47.863 --> 09:49.622
It looks a bit like smoke.

09:49.902 --> 09:52.263
Smoke! Yes, see?
It's a proper supercar.

09:52.622 --> 09:54.743
It didn't just go round
like a robot and be boring.

09:55.022 --> 09:57.623
It came to the track
and exploded immediately.

09:57.983 --> 10:00.343
That's what supercars do.
It's proper!

10:01.063 --> 10:03.902
Even as we speak,
several stylish Italian mechanics

10:04.302 --> 10:08.063
are looking at the engine
in the Zonda, hoping they can
coax some life into it,

10:08.623 --> 10:13.343
and maybe, just maybe, later on,
we'll be able to bring you
a lap of that as well.

10:13.622 --> 10:16.423
And then we'll see.
Zonda versus Bugatti.

10:16.663 --> 10:18.183
Then we'll sort it out.

10:18.623 --> 10:24.782
Right, we've always thought there's-
absolutely no reason for anyone
to own a Peugeot. Hang on.

10:24.902 --> 10:25.222
See?

10:26.422 --> 10:26.903
Mmm...

10:28.103 --> 10:30.222
No, anyone here got a Peugeot?

10:31.063 --> 10:31.182
AUDIENCE RESPOND

10:31.783 --> 10:32.222
Why?

10:33.663 --> 10:34.983
Who said "yes"?

10:35.663 --> 10:37.183
Why have you got a Peugeot?

10:37.463 --> 10:39.942
It was given to me.
It was given to you.

10:40.183 --> 10:40.383
LAUGHTER

10:40.982 --> 10:42.783
Damn, that's a reason!

10:42.902 --> 10:44.782
What sort of Peugeot is it?

10:45.063 --> 10:46.583
306. 306...
HE MOUTHS

10:48.742 --> 10:49.183
Lovely!

10:51.943 --> 10:55.743
No, really, apart from being given
one, I can't think of a reason.

10:56.103 --> 11:01.462
Peugeot have decided to address
this, and they think they have
with this. It's the Partner Teepee.

11:01.742 --> 11:02.863
LAUGHTER
No, ah...!

11:03.463 --> 11:05.983
Bear with me. Here's the reason.

11:06.382 --> 11:10.783
They've fitted it with a roof box
that goes inside, over the seats,

11:11.143 --> 11:15.783
and they say it's ideal
for storing long thin things in,
like a surfboard.

11:15.903 --> 11:17.423
So, what they're saying is,

11:17.983 --> 11:23.423
if you are a surfer
who wants a car with a loft
you can keep your surfboard in...

11:23.662 --> 11:27.463
Are there any surfers here?
Yes? Who's a surfer?

11:28.583 --> 11:30.583
Do you like to keep it dry?

11:30.982 --> 11:35.103
How many surfers are there...
"I don't like
getting my surfboard wet".

11:35.463 --> 11:37.222
It's just...
It's not going well, is it.

11:37.463 --> 11:38.982
No. Still no reason to own one.

11:39.263 --> 11:43.543
But, Peugeot fans, this has a big
brother called the Expert Teepee.

11:43.663 --> 11:44.622
There it is.

11:44.743 --> 11:47.222
Mmmm! No, no, no, no. Listen.

11:47.463 --> 11:51.783
They say that this is designed
for the three-children family,

11:52.183 --> 11:57.023
where one child plays a drum kit,
one plays a tuba
and one plays the double bass.

11:57.262 --> 11:59.263
They're not THAT specific
about it... They are.

11:59.542 --> 12:02.743
What sort of band are those kids in?

12:03.502 --> 12:09.902
The National Youth Salvation Army
Dixieland Jazz Band Orchestra
of Great Britain, or something!

12:10.183 --> 12:13.503
Though it's why is it called
a Teepee that fascinates me.

12:13.903 --> 12:18.743
The Americans are going to steal it-
and let you build a casino
where it used to be.

12:18.862 --> 12:21.143
How much is it? Oh, I don't care.

12:21.422 --> 12:25.422
If your sister gives you
one of those, just say no!

12:27.103 --> 12:30.062
You know Boris Johnson,
Mayor of London?

12:30.463 --> 12:34.102
I was driving behind a bus
this week, and I took a photo of
the message he's put on it.

12:34.382 --> 12:36.623
This is from the Mayor of London.

12:37.022 --> 12:40.063
It says, "Amazing!
Changing gears at lower revs

12:40.303 --> 12:42.342
"reduces your CO2 emissions
and saves you money".

12:42.743 --> 12:49.022
I was then reading GQ magazine,
a road test of a Ferrari 430,
and it says,

12:49.422 --> 12:55.343
"The essence of it, in my view,
is not to change up
until you hit about 6,000 revs".

12:55.743 --> 12:59.063
This was written by somebody
called Boris Johnson.

13:00.383 --> 13:02.143
Jeremy. Yeah. The slippers.

13:02.422 --> 13:05.623
Yep. Are they a bet?
Of course they're a bet.

13:05.743 --> 13:07.263
Thank God for that.

13:07.623 --> 13:10.742
Big news! Is it the Dacia Sandero?

13:11.943 --> 13:12.383
No...

13:13.742 --> 13:17.742
It's the European
Car of the Year 2008 is...

13:18.183 --> 13:20.263
the replacement
for the Vauxhall Vectra.

13:20.543 --> 13:22.983
Ladies and gentlemen,
the Vauxhall Insignia.

13:23.982 --> 13:27.263
You had to look that up then. I did.
You forgot what it was called!

13:27.662 --> 13:31.823
The weird thing is, the three
of us were being driven around
in one of these last week

13:32.183 --> 13:34.903
and we didn't actually notice
what it was.

13:35.263 --> 13:38.462
Seriously, I was in that, back
and forth to a show we were doing,

13:38.743 --> 13:40.982
for three days,
and I thought it was a Renault.

13:41.223 --> 13:44.983
I can remember one thing
about it - it had very hard seats.

13:45.142 --> 13:46.702
Yes, it did. Ah!

13:47.583 --> 13:53.542
You can't criticise those,
because a German panel
of seat experts... A what?

13:54.263 --> 13:57.943
There's a German panel...? There's
a German panel of seat experts.

13:58.342 --> 14:00.782
And I've invited them all
to your house for Christmas! Oh!

14:01.063 --> 14:04.583
Where would you put them?!
"Have a seat... No, stand up".

14:04.982 --> 14:11.303
They have voted to give it their
coveted accolade for the quality
of the seats. That's rubbish.

14:11.702 --> 14:15.463
It's like people that say
you've got to eat natural yoghurt
because it's good for you.

14:15.863 --> 14:19.423
You get those people who say,
"I like a hard bed,
it's good for your spine". It isn't.

14:19.783 --> 14:22.622
I hate hard beds.
I do like a hard bed.

14:23.022 --> 14:29.223
Sorry, Richard. Can anyone think
of one thing in the world
which is better hard than soft?

14:29.462 --> 14:31.462
LAUGHTER
That's quite awkward, actually.

14:33.382 --> 14:34.183
What? Ice.

14:34.702 --> 14:35.623
Ice.
LAUGHTER

14:37.343 --> 14:38.222
Ice?
APPLAUSE

14:45.182 --> 14:47.342
He got us out of it.

14:47.582 --> 14:50.942
Thanks for getting us out of that
one, mate. Can we move on, please?

14:51.342 --> 14:55.423
Earlier on, we three
were invited to switch on
Blackpool's famous Christmas lights.

14:55.662 --> 14:57.742
It's quite a big deal.

14:58.103 --> 15:01.142
Look at the pantheon of greats
who have had the call in the past.

15:01.543 --> 15:05.703
Frank Bough, Ken Dodd, Danny La Rue,
Cannon and Ball, and now us.

15:05.983 --> 15:09.143
Problem is, it only takes
one person to flick a light switch.

15:09.582 --> 15:14.542
So, to decide which one of us
would do that, the producers
organised a race to Blackpool.

15:14.783 --> 15:18.103
First one there would get
their name in the history books.

15:18.382 --> 15:22.503
Unfortunately, they decided that
the starting point for this race

15:22.902 --> 15:26.702
would be in Basel,
which is here in Switzerland.

15:26.943 --> 15:30.742
And that is 750 miles
from the light switch.

15:31.343 --> 15:32.902
And here's the tricky bit.

15:33.263 --> 15:36.423
They said we could only use
one tank of fuel.

15:36.823 --> 15:40.743
We could fill our cars in Basel,
but then the tanks would be sealed.

15:41.143 --> 15:46.262
I thought it was a stupid idea.
750 miles on a tank?

15:46.543 --> 15:49.103
That's 750 miles
of careful driving.

15:49.823 --> 15:52.703
That's not a race.
It's my idea of hell.

15:52.902 --> 15:55.063
It's actually my idea of heaven.

15:55.343 --> 15:58.623
Anyway, we could use
any production car we liked,

15:58.983 --> 16:03.142
and we weren't allowed
to modify it in any way.

16:07.302 --> 16:13.583
Our meeting place was in the centre
of Basel, the night before the off.

16:14.463 --> 16:18.702
This is the car I'd chosen -
a Subaru Legacy diesel.

16:19.143 --> 16:26.143
Yes, it's a big four-wheel-drive
estate, but it has a large fuel tank
which gives good range.

16:26.543 --> 16:29.343
And this is the car Jeremy
had chosen, because he's an idiot.

16:29.622 --> 16:32.103
An enormous twin-turbo
Jaguar XJ6 TDVi.

16:34.742 --> 16:39.302
0 to 60 - 7.8 seconds.
Top speed - 141.

16:39.542 --> 16:42.383
You're not trying to get to 60.
You're trying to get to Blackpool.

16:42.623 --> 16:43.703
There's no point.

16:44.023 --> 16:46.142
Why? I've been explaining this
to you for weeks.

16:46.542 --> 16:49.262
We're not gonna be able to do it.
If you're gonna fail,

16:49.622 --> 16:51.383
you may as well fail
in style and comfort.

16:51.623 --> 16:54.943
'Whereas James would fail
in a sea of noise.'

16:55.223 --> 16:56.262
It's a boxer engine.

16:56.663 --> 17:00.182
Yes. It's the worst diesel engine
I've ever come across.
It has no talk.

17:00.462 --> 17:04.502
To rev the nuts off it in first,
then when you go into second...

17:04.903 --> 17:11.301
It's... I'd rather go to Blackpool
in one of those horrible
eco Volkswagen BlueMotion things.

17:11.582 --> 17:14.542
That hideous little Polo?
Yes, the three-cylinder.

17:14.942 --> 17:18.143
Richard then arrived
in a Polo BlueMotion.

17:18.383 --> 17:22.061
What are you thinking of, man?
Miles per gallon?

17:22.303 --> 17:22.502
35?

17:23.702 --> 17:25.502
50. Gonna ask me?

17:27.182 --> 17:31.103
How many miles per gallon...?
You see, this is a VW Polo...
We know what it is!

17:31.502 --> 17:36.343
It's one of the most economical
cars money can buy.
74 miles per gallon.

17:36.742 --> 17:41.023
It's an ordinary car underneath,
but they've made it
extra aerodynamic.

17:41.422 --> 17:44.503
Tiny door mirrors
so it cuts through the air
with barely a ripple.

17:44.743 --> 17:49.503
And a little, tiny boot spoiler.
It's a very exciting car.

17:49.742 --> 17:51.503
Three-cylinder,
1.4-litre diesel engine.

17:52.502 --> 17:55.543
There it is! Look at that.
Yeah, it's under...

17:55.822 --> 17:59.622
Thanks(!) I've just saved you
a little bit of weight. Wow!

17:59.903 --> 18:02.103
If it's an eco car,
why have they put that on it?

18:02.382 --> 18:05.183
So that when you open your bonnet,
when your mates are around,

18:05.462 --> 18:08.663
they don't realise that you've got
a PATHETIC three-cylinder...!

18:08.902 --> 18:11.663
Yeah, yeah... Can I ask...?
There's one other question.

18:12.022 --> 18:14.862
You don't need that...
There's one other question.

18:15.102 --> 18:17.343
It kept cropping up
when I was choosing my car.

18:17.582 --> 18:19.703
How big is the fuel tank in this?

18:20.103 --> 18:22.463
Ten gallons. Ten gallons.
And it's...

18:22.863 --> 18:26.543
74... ..74 miles to the gallon -
740-mile range. Yes.

18:26.783 --> 18:28.902
How far's Blackpool?
About... 750 miles, I think.

18:29.143 --> 18:30.542
So, there you go.

18:30.943 --> 18:33.543
Well, hang on a second.
What can you expect?

18:33.782 --> 18:35.782
Well, theoretical range, 706 miles.

18:36.023 --> 18:37.542
Not far enough. No.

18:37.942 --> 18:41.262
Jeremy... 655.
I've told you - it's pointless.

18:42.103 --> 18:44.822
It's a pointless challenge.
On paper...

18:45.182 --> 18:48.423
Nevertheless, in the very early
hours of the following morning,

18:48.822 --> 18:53.183
we assembled at a Swiss
filling station to brim our tanks
and make some final checks.

18:53.462 --> 18:56.783
Richard made sure
his tyre pressures were correct,

18:58.223 --> 19:02.623
because if they were even slightly
down, it could cost him 20 miles.

19:02.863 --> 19:05.263
And I taped up my cracks.

19:05.702 --> 19:08.822
This might only be worth 200 yards,

19:09.102 --> 19:13.262
but the last bit of the journey
is 200 yards long.

19:13.622 --> 19:16.823
Jeremy, meanwhile, confident
of failure, was having breakfast.

19:17.782 --> 19:20.983
Those two are taking it
so seriously.

19:22.542 --> 19:27.462
One of the most important factors
in economy runs is lightness,

19:27.703 --> 19:31.262
which is why Jeremy and I
had packed James's luggage.

19:31.662 --> 19:34.463
Yeah, that's a paperweight,
just in case.

19:34.703 --> 19:36.262
You're really funny men(!)

19:37.103 --> 19:41.742
But what if you need one of these?
What if you need a wishbone?

19:42.143 --> 19:48.103
If you run out of fuel and then
a lorry driver needs a gearbox,
you could give him one.

19:48.503 --> 19:52.263
It's transaxle...
You're spoiling an otherwise
very interesting experiment.

19:52.663 --> 19:56.702
Name one thing that's gonna happen
today that is interesting.

19:57.222 --> 20:02.183
We're about to do the impossible,
and that feels good. Top Gear's
always succeeding. Yeah! No.

20:02.582 --> 20:08.142
With the tanks brimmed,
the filler caps were sealed
with impenetrable gaffer tape,

20:08.663 --> 20:13.063
and then at exactly 11 minutes
past 4, we were ready for the off.

20:13.222 --> 20:18.943
This is it. I'm not gonna start
the car until the last minute.

20:25.103 --> 20:30.303
That has to be the dullest start
to any Top Gear race, ever...

20:30.543 --> 20:32.822
In fact, any race in history.

20:33.182 --> 20:37.102
I don't know if you were looking
forward to Top Gear tonight,

20:37.502 --> 20:39.982
but, you know, there'll be
something else on somewhere.

20:40.342 --> 20:44.902
In fact,
there was only one man in Europe

20:44.902 --> 20:48.223
looking forward
to 17 hours of mental arithmetic.

20:48.463 --> 20:54.222
60 miles per gallon, my average so
far over 5.1 miles has gone up to 50.

20:54.422 --> 20:56.462
Clarkson needs to average 44.7...

20:56.702 --> 21:00.503
But before you switch over
to Heartbeat, consider this.

21:01.982 --> 21:06.342
This is a very clever race,
because there's that balance
between getting there,

21:06.502 --> 21:08.023
so that means efficient driving,

21:08.422 --> 21:11.222
and speed, because
there's no point getting there

21:11.623 --> 21:15.902
when James has already said,
"I declare these lights on".

21:18.302 --> 21:20.543
Weirdly, we'd all chosen
different ways

21:20.822 --> 21:23.503
of getting from Basel
to the Channel.

21:23.782 --> 21:25.783
Richard had opted
for the shortest route,

21:25.903 --> 21:27.062
through towns, villages,

21:27.462 --> 21:30.183
and worst of all,
the Vosges mountains.

21:30.463 --> 21:32.303
But this didn't seem
to worry him.

21:32.702 --> 21:36.623
If there's the odd hill, it doesn't-
matter, cos you've got to go up,

21:36.863 --> 21:39.103
but then you've got to
come down again.

21:42.222 --> 21:43.862
It'll average out as downhill.

21:44.102 --> 21:46.463
My route, past Strasbourg and Metz,

21:47.102 --> 21:49.702
was 30 miles further
than Hammond's,

21:49.942 --> 21:51.622
but there's fewer hills

21:51.743 --> 21:53.382
and, hopefully,
less traffic.

21:53.862 --> 21:56.622
Thinking ahead is what it's about.

21:56.983 --> 21:59.342
Planning so that
I don't brake unnecessarily.

21:59.742 --> 22:03.022
Because what is not understood
is that braking
effectively wastes fuel.

22:03.302 --> 22:07.543
It turns the kinetic energy
of the car into heat...

22:08.623 --> 22:10.303
As James did science,

22:10.662 --> 22:13.423
Jeremy was heading
in the wrong direction.

22:13.783 --> 22:15.503
He'd elected to stick
to the motorways,

22:15.783 --> 22:19.103
which meant his route
was 836 miles -

22:19.462 --> 22:22.062
almost 200 more
than the Jag could do.

22:22.463 --> 22:27.223
And that means I'll run out
more quickly, and then
I'll just check into a little pub,

22:27.463 --> 22:29.222
have a juicy steak and go to sleep.

22:29.662 --> 22:34.502
You may have noticed there
that I was wearing
a high-visibility jacket.

22:34.742 --> 22:37.582
The French recently,
and very quietly, introduced a law

22:37.862 --> 22:41.143
saying you've got to have one
of these in your car at all times.

22:41.542 --> 22:45.703
Maybe we should introduce a law
saying you've got to have onions
in the boot of your car,

22:46.103 --> 22:49.862
don't announce it,
and then fine every French person
who arrives in Dover without any.

22:50.102 --> 22:54.862
As we drove through the darkness,
my pessimism began to spread.

22:56.583 --> 22:59.182
Average 64.6 - that's not enough.

22:59.663 --> 23:01.422
It's just not enough, I won't do it.

23:01.862 --> 23:06.343
Instant fuel consumption
went down from 65mpg to 52,
and that's not good enough.

23:06.583 --> 23:08.622
No, it's uphill. Oh, God.

23:08.863 --> 23:12.662
I, however, was delighted,
because I'd just worked out

23:13.063 --> 23:16.703
that if I went fast enough,
I could conk out on the M40,

23:16.823 --> 23:19.822
just a few minutes from my house.

23:19.942 --> 23:20.422
Range,

23:21.222 --> 23:22.023
605 miles.

23:23.102 --> 23:23.942
That's perfect!

23:24.902 --> 23:28.382
That meant I could spend my time
wondering which of my colleagues

23:28.742 --> 23:32.503
would be best suited to switching
on Blackpool's fairy lights.

23:32.902 --> 23:36.383
Think about it - Danny La Rue,
Ken Dodd, Cannon, Ball, Hammond.

23:36.582 --> 23:38.102
It has a ring.

23:39.662 --> 23:42.302
Dawn broke over our dreary race.

23:43.623 --> 23:46.103
I'm doing 55 miles per gallon.

23:46.222 --> 23:48.142
It's not good enough. Relax.

23:48.262 --> 23:50.183
I'm tensing up. OK, relax.

23:50.422 --> 23:53.983
Hammond won't be able to do this.
Too angry.

23:54.383 --> 23:56.702
I'm on an economy drive,
saving the planet,

23:56.983 --> 23:59.423
and you, in your bus, with nobody
in it, made me slow down.

23:59.822 --> 24:05.783
I had to use my brakes,
and then I've got to accelerate
again, which uses more fuel.

24:06.023 --> 24:09.102
I, too, was having problems
in the Jag.

24:09.383 --> 24:11.383
How can a V6 twin-turbo,

24:11.622 --> 24:14.702
in a car that's 375 yards long,

24:16.183 --> 24:17.423
possibly be doing

24:17.783 --> 24:20.063
49 miles to the gallon?

24:20.303 --> 24:20.622
49.1!

24:22.062 --> 24:23.383
It's going up!

24:23.863 --> 24:28.502
At this rate, I'd be running out
near Birmingham
rather than on my doorstep.

24:28.862 --> 24:33.023
It was therefore time
to break out the heavy foot.

24:34.463 --> 24:35.783
There we go.

24:38.342 --> 24:42.463
Don't want to get it too hot,
because I'm not going to
put the air-conditioning on.

24:42.742 --> 24:47.822
Some people calculate that it can
reduce your efficiency by about 10%.

24:47.982 --> 24:49.622
That's fine by me, mate.

24:50.023 --> 24:52.382
I've got everything on.
Air-conditioned seats...

24:53.822 --> 24:56.543
I'm even heating the passenger seat-
for no good reason,

24:56.782 --> 24:58.583
other than to burn fuel.

24:58.943 --> 25:02.823
'Despite being in France,
I even powered up the radio.'

25:02.982 --> 25:04.622
MAN SINGS IN FRENCH

25:09.743 --> 25:14.943
After three hours,
the little Polo was off
the A-roads and on the motorway.

25:15.303 --> 25:18.023
I was a few miles ahead
of hyper-miler May...

25:18.262 --> 25:19.822
69 miles per gallon!

25:20.183 --> 25:22.542
..but way behind
hyper-spacer Clarkson.

25:23.743 --> 25:25.503
81 miles an hour.

25:26.623 --> 25:29.703
Amazingly, my car
was now doing 78mpg,

25:29.943 --> 25:32.182
but I had a new problem.

25:32.303 --> 25:34.823
My average mpg now is enough.

25:35.663 --> 25:41.023
I can make it. But my average
speed, I won't make it in time.

25:42.942 --> 25:44.383
Hammond. 'Hello?' I'm bored!

25:44.743 --> 25:47.662
What are your figures? Tell me
your numbers. Average speed...

25:47.942 --> 25:48.623
'Yes?' 63.

25:50.423 --> 25:51.703
Wow! That's immense.

25:51.983 --> 25:52.782
What's yours?

25:54.022 --> 25:58.983
Not good. 34. You're not gonna
make Blackpool till about Sunday.

25:59.103 --> 26:00.662
That's the problem I have there.

26:01.022 --> 26:03.263
'And what's your predicted
range of your car?'

26:03.383 --> 26:05.663
It says I'm gonna be out of fuel

26:05.783 --> 26:06.943
in 450 miles.

26:07.182 --> 26:09.343
Blackpool - 669 miles away.

26:14.182 --> 26:19.823
'Frankly, it didn't look like
any of us were going to be
turning on the lights that night.'

26:20.222 --> 26:25.102
One, two.. Ladies and gentlemen,
all the way from BBC Two's Top Gear,

26:25.343 --> 26:26.023
please welcome...nobody.

26:30.782 --> 26:34.783
Meanwhile, many miles to the north,
the people of Blackpool

26:35.182 --> 26:38.823
to their big day, unaware
that us three wouldn't be there.

26:39.103 --> 26:42.303
However, having known all along
that this was a possibility,

26:42.583 --> 26:45.023
the show's producers
had sent backup.

26:50.462 --> 26:54.623
Six hours into the journey,
and thanks to some careful driving,

26:54.982 --> 26:57.943
all our cars
were starting to hit their targets.

26:58.222 --> 27:02.983
Overall fuel consumption - 68 miles
per gallon. That is excellent.

27:03.342 --> 27:05.102
74.9mpg, I'm averaging now.

27:06.343 --> 27:08.822
That is bang-on
what I should be doing.

27:09.022 --> 27:10.582
Fuel is burning away...

27:11.543 --> 27:13.303
..29 miles to the gallon.

27:13.703 --> 27:19.263
The only problem was boredom,
and that was made worse
by a phone call from James.

27:19.663 --> 27:23.342
'I just did a bit more
mental calculations looking
at the statistics for the cars.'

27:23.583 --> 27:25.582
Luckily you're breaking up, James.

27:25.982 --> 27:29.542
'I said I've done little bit
more...the cars...'

27:30.542 --> 27:34.343
For the one viewer
we have left who now isn't
watching Midsomer Murders?

27:34.583 --> 27:38.743
I may have been bored,
but at least I didn't need the loo.

27:38.863 --> 27:41.342
I'm quite desperate for a pee.

27:42.702 --> 27:48.183
In Blackpool, though, our man
on the ground wasn't bored at all.

27:54.343 --> 28:00.182
Eight hours into my doomed run, and-
I was now bearing down on Calais.

28:00.583 --> 28:02.542
Hammond is currently
30 miles behind me,

28:02.942 --> 28:07.463
and he's dropping back at the rate
of about 20 seconds a mile.

28:07.583 --> 28:09.582
He might make Blackpool tomorrow.

28:13.663 --> 28:17.223
'Jeremy was right. I might
have been getting almost 80mpg,

28:17.503 --> 28:19.543
'but what was the point?'

28:19.783 --> 28:23.822
So, I'm gonna spend a bit more fuel-
to get there on time.

28:24.223 --> 28:27.982
So, let's bring that average
fuel consumption down,
and average speed up.

28:28.223 --> 28:29.743
This is a race.

28:30.182 --> 28:34.423
'The only problem was, someone else-
had had the same idea.'

28:34.542 --> 28:36.063
Richard Hammond! No! No!

28:37.783 --> 28:40.142
It's neck and neck,
ladies and gentlemen.

28:40.382 --> 28:44.663
'I, too, thought it was time
to trade fuel for speed,

28:45.063 --> 28:48.383
'and so began the dullest duel
in history.'

28:48.623 --> 28:52.543
No, me instant mpg...
Mustn't just put my foot down.

28:52.782 --> 28:54.343
No, it's plummeting. 49.

29:02.502 --> 29:03.782
That fuel gauge...

29:04.903 --> 29:09.902
I've got a third of a tank to get
from Folkestone to Blackpool.

29:10.302 --> 29:14.303
Why am I bothering?
Why don't you just have lunch?

29:14.543 --> 29:16.183
'Half-an-hour behind Jeremy...'
Bonjour.

29:18.023 --> 29:23.863
'..our spine-tingling race had ended-
in a dead heat at the toll booth.'

29:26.143 --> 29:27.902
What a miserable cow.

29:30.222 --> 29:37.142
On the train, Hammond saved weight
by emptying his bladder,
while I went even further.

29:37.543 --> 29:40.502
Are you going anywhere near London?
Yeah, Wimbledon.

29:40.742 --> 29:42.583
Do you mind awfully
taking this wheel?

29:42.983 --> 29:49.543
Only it's quite heavy and I'm trying-
to save fuel, and I think that
could make 0.2 mile per gallon.

29:49.783 --> 29:53.223
As they waited to depart,
I arrived back in Blighty, took off

29:53.502 --> 29:58.263
my high-visibility jacket and set
the finish line firmly in my sights.

29:58.542 --> 30:02.783
Dover to North Oxfordshire
on a third of a tank.

30:03.023 --> 30:04.102
Sounds about right.

30:05.183 --> 30:08.303
Air-con on, cool seats on, radio on.

30:08.942 --> 30:14.622
RADIO: 'The Blackpool illuminations
get switched on this evening
by the hosts of BBC Two's Top Gear,

30:15.023 --> 30:19.143
'Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond
and James May. Do you think
they're racing there now?'

30:19.703 --> 30:24.423
I don't think so, Steve!
I don't think any of us
will be doing it.

30:24.702 --> 30:24.903
APPLAUSE

30:29.582 --> 30:31.823
And we'll find out
what happens later on.

30:32.183 --> 30:35.502
But now, if you've always
fancied a supercar

30:35.743 --> 30:39.303
but you need space to carry
stuff like children, luggage, a hat,

30:39.702 --> 30:43.862
maybe a pencil,
your only choice has been this,
the four-door Maserati Quattroporte.

30:44.262 --> 30:50.183
Now though, Porsche and Aston Martin-
are thinking along similar lines
to that, and then there is this.

30:50.303 --> 30:52.303
This is the Lamborghini Estoque.

30:52.823 --> 30:55.782
This is not actually a real car yet,
it's just a model.

30:56.063 --> 30:59.582
And Lamborghini say if they do
make it, it could have a diesel.

30:59.743 --> 31:01.382
I don't think so.

31:01.982 --> 31:03.503
Or, a hybrid engine.

31:03.622 --> 31:05.062
I don't think so.

31:05.462 --> 31:09.582
Or maybe the V10
from the new Gallardo.
That's more likely, I think.

31:09.983 --> 31:13.062
Whatever engine it is,
it will go here at the front.

31:13.343 --> 31:16.622
And that means there is room
for a proper boot at the back,

31:16.902 --> 31:20.423
and more importantly, there is room
in here for four people.

31:20.863 --> 31:24.983
And it's not one of those supercars
with seats in the front
and token seats in the back.

31:25.262 --> 31:28.903
It really is massive. Have
a look at the legroom back there.

31:29.303 --> 31:31.742
Do you know what I love
about this most of all?

31:32.183 --> 31:37.983
They haven't fallen into the same
trap that Porsche fell into
with the off-roader, the Cayenne.

31:38.263 --> 31:41.223
Because that, they've got
a supercar, 911 nose on the front,

31:41.503 --> 31:44.182
and an ordinary car on the back.
You go, "Wow, it's Kate Moss."

31:44.463 --> 31:48.463
Then you look down the side, "Oh,
no, it's got John Prescott's arse."

31:48.743 --> 31:51.662
This... From every angle
it just gets better looking.

31:51.942 --> 31:54.902
It's just staggering.
Please make it. Anyway.

31:57.343 --> 32:00.662
We've got to leave this alone,
sadly,

32:00.782 --> 32:03.743
because it is now time to put
a star in our reasonably priced car.

32:04.022 --> 32:06.103
What can I say
about my guest tonight?

32:06.502 --> 32:10.062
Born on 4th July, Top Gun,
Days Of Thunder,

32:10.182 --> 32:12.102
he has watched them all.

32:12.823 --> 32:14.343
Ladies and gentlemen, Harry Enfield.

32:14.463 --> 32:15.662
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

32:17.343 --> 32:18.143
Harry! Hello.

32:20.303 --> 32:25.303
Are you very well? I'm very well.
Good to see you.

32:27.862 --> 32:30.943
Now, can I just say, because
I don't think many people will

32:31.183 --> 32:37.262
remember this - Harry was the first-
guest we ever had on new Top Gear.

32:37.383 --> 32:39.062
And you came back!

32:40.022 --> 32:41.663
Yeah. There's a story to that.

32:42.062 --> 32:47.302
Which is? Which is that when I came-
on, I did the round in the car,

32:47.702 --> 32:52.782
the reasonably priced car, I didn't-
really realise it was a competition.

32:53.183 --> 32:58.062
And so I did the lap, and The
Stig said "You can take a few
seconds off if you do it again,"

32:58.262 --> 32:59.943
and I said "No, I want my lunch."

33:00.183 --> 33:03.863
So you put your stomach
in front of your pride.

33:03.983 --> 33:06.502
I think it was a 2.01.

33:06.743 --> 33:08.863
Two minutes and one seconds.

33:09.102 --> 33:11.342
Biblically slow.
Yeah. But you see I didn't realise.

33:11.743 --> 33:16.502
I thought as long as I was in
the car going "Ooh, eeeh," then
that would be good television.

33:16.903 --> 33:20.902
And it turned out that my son who
is now 11, Archie, and my daughter,

33:21.302 --> 33:25.222
Poppy, they watch your shows
and then they come through all
the time and go "Dad, Dad!

33:25.582 --> 33:28.063
"Jeremy's being horrible
about you again!"

33:28.462 --> 33:32.702
So you're coming back now
to try and... And you took
the piss out of my cars too.

33:32.983 --> 33:36.062
Why wouldn't I? I have to say...
I had a... I had a...

33:36.182 --> 33:38.462
You went, "And look at this car!

33:38.823 --> 33:42.143
"This is Harry's car,
when he became Loadsamoney."

33:42.542 --> 33:46.783
And they took off the thing and it
was a Vauxhall Cavalier convertible,
which I thought was fine,

33:47.143 --> 33:50.862
and all the men with wigs in
the audience went "hehehehehehe".

33:50.983 --> 33:51.182
LAUGHTER

33:52.902 --> 33:56.543
So, you were back recently
with Paul Whitehouse.

33:56.942 --> 34:00.622
Fantastic to see you back
together again in Harry
and Paul, which I think

34:00.982 --> 34:04.823
was the funniest thing
I'd ever seen on television,

34:05.062 --> 34:08.462
and I'm not saying
that to blow smoke up your bottom.

34:08.743 --> 34:10.983
I really did think it was.
That's very kind of you, Jeremy.

34:11.382 --> 34:12.621
Didn't Johnny Depp once say
the finest actor he's ever seen
was Paul Whitehouse?

34:13.022 --> 34:15.463
Yeah, it was. Not you. No, it was
Paul Whitehouse and not me.

34:15.703 --> 34:17.023
And I think he's right.

34:17.422 --> 34:21.822
I think Paul Whitehouse is one
of the finest actors. I do, too.
And you're the second finest.

34:22.063 --> 34:27.661
Although I have to say there was
one target that you picked on...

34:28.022 --> 34:31.022
I don't know
what you're talking about.

34:31.382 --> 34:33.103
I do know what I'm talking about.
I thought it was quite mean.
He picked on me!

34:33.543 --> 34:40.902
And we even have a clip of him
picking on me which the producer
thinks you need to see. Here it is.

34:41.023 --> 34:41.342
Hello.

34:42.463 --> 34:46.621
I'm on an island,
and not just any island.

34:47.022 --> 34:49.702
Because this island
is Clarkson Island.

34:50.661 --> 34:52.822
And unlike any other island,

34:53.062 --> 34:57.943
Clarkson Island has the greatest
number of Clarksons in the world.

34:58.663 --> 35:00.343
Come on now, Clarksy.

35:03.662 --> 35:05.342
We have to clip them twice a year.

35:05.742 --> 35:10.622
Otherwise their woolly hair gets
clogged up with all the BLEEP
that comes out of their mouths.

35:10.823 --> 35:11.062
APPLAUSE

35:12.262 --> 35:13.542
It's very funny.

35:19.702 --> 35:22.423
My son watches that every hour.

35:22.903 --> 35:25.142
Watches that? Yeah.
"Dad, you're on again!

35:25.543 --> 35:28.823
"Well, not you, there's a lot of
BLEEP coming out of your mouth,
Dad!"

35:29.223 --> 35:31.703
And you didn't get
"in the world" right.

35:31.942 --> 35:37.903
Oh. Yes, I did. No. You have
to say this is the fastest car...

35:39.103 --> 35:40.863
The pause is everything.

35:44.422 --> 35:47.102
..in the world. There, you see?
That's how you do it.

35:47.342 --> 35:47.543
APPLAUSE

35:49.943 --> 35:51.263
Much too quick.

35:52.703 --> 35:55.662
That was the best "in the world".

35:56.023 --> 35:58.142
No! That was the best...

35:59.022 --> 36:00.182
..in the world. No!

36:00.422 --> 36:02.423
You're coming too soon, Enfield.

36:03.423 --> 36:06.742
You are very good actor. Do you
have to work at impersonations? No.

36:07.022 --> 36:10.303
You don't? Cos Rory Bremner
spends hours and weeks and months.

36:10.663 --> 36:13.423
Well, that's why he's really good
and I'm not very good.

36:13.662 --> 36:15.062
You're doing yourself down.

36:15.303 --> 36:16.822
Look at Clarkson there.

36:17.102 --> 36:20.822
I don't even look like you. He had
dark hair. You've got grey hair.

36:23.543 --> 36:28.543
You once said when you started
there was no comedy -

36:28.823 --> 36:29.223
well, comedy for the working
classes was patronising

36:29.503 --> 36:31.982
and it was all Cambridge Footlights.
Do you still think that?

36:32.342 --> 36:34.822
It used to be. It used to be crap
sitcoms for the working classes.

36:35.222 --> 36:37.823
Yeah. Bum titty wee-wee. Yeah,
that kind of things. Ooh, madam.

36:38.222 --> 36:43.663
And then there was Footlights
for the upper classes
and nothing in between.

36:44.023 --> 36:45.662
And I think when we started,
we just tried to do

36:46.063 --> 36:49.463
family characters, but they were
a bit more intelligent. I think.

36:49.902 --> 36:53.062
One of the things
I loved was that there was
an assumption of knowledge.

36:53.423 --> 36:55.782
It was sort of deliberately
excluding the stupid.

36:56.302 --> 37:00.102
If you didn't know what the
Sicilian Defence was in chess,
you didn't get one of the jokes.

37:00.463 --> 37:03.783
We've got to an age where we just
thought, OK, we're going to do

37:04.183 --> 37:09.782
what we want to do and we'll
find it funny, and I think it sort
of helped our relationship, too.

37:10.143 --> 37:12.742
We genuinely enjoyed
what we were doing with each other,

37:13.102 --> 37:16.582
rather than just spouting lines
that we thought everyone would like.

37:16.943 --> 37:20.023
I want to talk about cars, if I may.
Oh yeah, let's talk about cars.

37:20.263 --> 37:22.382
Let's do that.
The last time you were on...

37:22.622 --> 37:24.383
Is BLEEP really a swear word?

37:27.503 --> 37:30.583
I thought it just meant bad driver.

37:41.462 --> 37:44.942
I get called it a lot, you see.

37:45.183 --> 37:46.223
We recommended... Sorry,

37:46.623 --> 37:51.503
yes, cars. When you were last here,-
we recommended you bought
a Volvo XC90.

37:51.782 --> 37:55.063
Yeah, I bought one
and I had for three years, and then

37:55.462 --> 38:01.983
Ken Livingstone said it was just
above the limit and he was going to-
charge Â£25 a day for us to drive it.

38:02.143 --> 38:05.462
So I swapped it in for a V70.

38:06.703 --> 38:10.382
So do you go down to
Cornwall in your Volvo? Yes,
we go down to Cornwall in our V70.

38:10.623 --> 38:14.783
Prince Harry, Prince whatever he's
called, the other one. William.

38:15.182 --> 38:20.623
They're all down there, yeah. Come
on, Mungo. There's a lot of that.

38:21.422 --> 38:23.503
Do you go to Rock?
Yeah, we do, yeah.

38:23.783 --> 38:26.982
I go surfing. And occasionally
the Daily Mail bloody get me.

38:27.182 --> 38:30.062
Cos I've got a paunch, you see.

38:30.303 --> 38:33.862
When you're in a wetsuit,
you look really, really stupid.

38:34.262 --> 38:37.103
And they always get me on the...
and there's the surfaceboard,

38:37.622 --> 38:44.503
about that much, the wave is about
that big and you can see the sand
at the bottom. I'm like that.

38:44.902 --> 38:50.823
Anyway, your lap. OK. It means
a lot to me, this lap, because
I've been so disgraced in the past.

38:51.223 --> 38:57.182
Unfortunately from your point of
view, there was a camera down at
the Hammerhead when you approached.

38:57.422 --> 38:59.583
Who'd like to see that? Yes.

38:59.982 --> 39:04.223
We've never seen anybody ever go
off at the Hammerhead. Jonathan
Ross got lost at the Hammerhead.

39:04.622 --> 39:07.942
We've never seen this before.
Here we go.

39:08.822 --> 39:12.823
Coming up now, heavy braking.
Too much understeer. No!

39:15.583 --> 39:16.022
Oh.

39:20.383 --> 39:23.183
Oh! A small gift.
Oh, thank you very much.

39:23.582 --> 39:26.983
The problem is that James May
is flying his plane home

39:27.542 --> 39:31.663
from that airfield tonight, and now-
you've removed the landing lights
which means he will be killed.

39:31.942 --> 39:33.182
So well done again for that.

39:33.463 --> 39:36.423
Thank you.
Who would like to see Harry's lap?

39:36.783 --> 39:40.743
Yes! Come on, let's have a look
at the real one. Here it is.

39:40.823 --> 39:42.863
And we're off. Look, a serious face.

39:43.222 --> 39:46.062
I'm determined
to beat my crap record.

39:49.183 --> 39:51.223
Steady. Is that all right?

39:51.622 --> 39:56.742
It's steady and accurate.
Does that mean slow?
No, that's wild, actually.

39:56.942 --> 39:59.103
Ooh, that was quite fun.

39:59.462 --> 40:04.142
The Stig did say you don't have
much feel for the car. Oh...

40:04.382 --> 40:08.182
I think I hit the brake about here.-
Woof.

40:08.583 --> 40:12.942
Yes, here we go. Are you going to
manage to get round it this time?

40:13.383 --> 40:17.863
You're certainly ambitious
with your speed there, Harry.
That's for sure.

40:18.223 --> 40:22.023
I must remember this
is a family show, must not swear.

40:22.303 --> 40:22.983
Stupid BLEEP!

40:24.662 --> 40:28.223
You can't put that out.
Yes, we can.

40:29.742 --> 40:31.822
Ooh! Look at that! Whoa!

40:33.503 --> 40:35.982
Now you're getting up some speed.

40:36.223 --> 40:40.982
That's a very good line through
there. And this is nearly good.

40:41.262 --> 40:44.103
And there he is, across the line!

40:47.982 --> 40:57.183
Well, here we are. Last time you
were here, in the old car which was-
slower than that, you did a 2.01.

40:57.302 --> 40:59.943
Brian Cox did it in the new car.

41:00.142 --> 41:01.463
Where would you like to go?

41:01.583 --> 41:04.943
I'd like to go just above Jay Kay.

41:06.383 --> 41:11.263
I did say to my son,
surely it'll be more comedy

41:11.623 --> 41:12.782
if I was even worse
than last time. He said "No, Dad.

41:13.022 --> 41:13.742
"No, Dad."

41:14.783 --> 41:15.263
Archie,

41:17.062 --> 41:19.662
you were 2.01 last time.
OK, Archie?

41:19.942 --> 41:21.463
One... he's already happy!

41:22.783 --> 41:23.743
Yay!
LAUGHTER

41:24.543 --> 41:27.542
40...

41:27.542 --> 41:27.982
9.7.

41:29.783 --> 41:32.383
There you go, ladies and gentlemen.

41:34.063 --> 41:35.342
You're in there.

41:38.143 --> 41:40.022
You're in that area. Ron Wood.

41:40.142 --> 41:40.823
Ronnie Wood!

41:41.783 --> 41:44.063
I'm really pleased with that.

41:44.462 --> 41:48.343
You are pleased?
Yeah, I beat Steve Coogan.
Cos he likes cars.

41:48.782 --> 41:53.863
He's always in cars. And not only
did you beat Steve Coogan, you are
by far our most improved guest.

41:54.143 --> 41:56.142
Ladies and gentlemen,
Harry Enfield!

41:56.342 --> 41:57.543
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

42:06.422 --> 42:10.222
Tonight, we are having a race from
Basel in Switzerland to Blackpool.

42:10.542 --> 42:13.702
First one there gets the honour
of switching on the town's
famous illuminations.

42:13.943 --> 42:18.702
Unfortunately we only had one tank
of fuel, which meant we could drive

42:19.143 --> 42:24.823
slowly, conserve petrol, but run the-
risk of not getting there on time,
or we could drive a bit more quickly

42:25.343 --> 42:29.703
but then run the risk of not
getting there at all. James and I
were taking it very seriously.

42:30.103 --> 42:34.102
When we left the action
we were here, waiting for our
Channel Tunnel train to set off.

42:34.382 --> 42:36.983
Jeremy meanwhile had decided
the whole thing was impossible.

42:37.222 --> 42:39.703
He'd chosen a big Jag, driven
through France like a loony,

42:40.142 --> 42:44.103
caught an earlier train than us
and was hoping to run out of fuel
as soon as he could.

42:44.543 --> 42:53.582
Finally, the producers had sent
The Stig on ahead to Blackpool as a
stand-in in case none of us made it.

43:04.343 --> 43:10.143
'With just over seven hours till
the big switch-on, James and I
were spat out of the Eurotunnel.'

43:10.543 --> 43:13.502
Rush-hour, Friday night,
over 300 miles to do.

43:13.622 --> 43:15.263
I've got enough fuel.

43:16.703 --> 43:18.502
Well, just. 295 miles,

43:20.383 --> 43:22.182
the computer's telling me.

43:23.063 --> 43:28.142
The fuel gauge would suggest
there's not more than a quarter
of the tank left.

43:28.422 --> 43:32.103
Which means three and a half gallons.
It doesn't sound like enough to me.

43:32.342 --> 43:34.223
It's gonna be quite exciting.

43:37.022 --> 43:40.582
Richard and I were close together,
but soon we'd split,

43:40.823 --> 43:43.582
as once again
we'd all chosen different routes.

43:43.783 --> 43:46.623
Hammond would use the M1 and the M6,

43:47.143 --> 43:52.743
whereas I would go all the way
up the M1 to Leeds
and then over the M62.

43:52.982 --> 43:58.583
This was 34 miles further, but I'd
miss the notorious M6 traffic jams.

43:58.983 --> 44:04.102
Jeremy, meanwhile was using the M40,-
because it goes past his house.

44:04.343 --> 44:06.502
Chipping Norton here I come.

44:07.223 --> 44:11.383
Phone my wife, tell her
I'll be home earlier than expected.

44:11.902 --> 44:19.502
'James and I could just about
make it, and make it on time,
as long as we didn't hit traffic.'

44:19.782 --> 44:22.142
Ah, what the hell is that?

44:23.822 --> 44:26.903
I'm losing out on time and fuel.

44:27.302 --> 44:33.262
My estimated time of arrival
is now slipping again, so it's
45 minutes it's moved already.

44:33.542 --> 44:37.303
Engine running, not going anywhere.
No miles per gallon.

44:39.263 --> 44:43.782
In Blackpool, people were starting
to arrive for the celebrations.

44:44.143 --> 44:49.502
Our man on the ground was preparing
by having an afternoon nap.

44:56.743 --> 45:01.262
'After two hours
and much wasted fuel,
Richard and I were finally on the M1,

45:01.502 --> 45:04.862
'where we would soon
go our separate ways.'

45:06.182 --> 45:13.102
If I'm going to get the Blackpool
spangly jacket, I have to pray
that Hammond gets stuck

45:13.503 --> 45:16.902
for about three-quarters
of an hour in bad traffic
around Birmingham.

45:17.303 --> 45:20.583
'My mind, however,
was only fixed on Jeremy.'

45:21.063 --> 45:22.862
He must be out of fuel by now.

45:23.102 --> 45:27.863
He must be. Surely the gods
of economy will punish him.

45:28.103 --> 45:30.342
'And then the phone rang.'

45:30.623 --> 45:32.983
Are you at the side of the road
yet? No.

45:33.102 --> 45:35.102
Stupid thing is still working.

45:35.503 --> 45:37.742
How is it doing that?
It's not possible.

45:37.982 --> 45:39.662
I'm 15 minutes from home.

45:39.902 --> 45:44.182
I can smell my bed. Hammond,
I'm so close. Stop!

45:45.622 --> 45:47.383
Stop now. Cough. Cough.

45:49.303 --> 45:50.582
Die. Die now!

45:52.862 --> 45:55.143
Bad luck, mate. Soldier on.

45:55.382 --> 45:56.902
I love that Jag.

45:57.182 --> 45:58.703
I love it so very much.

45:58.943 --> 46:03.863
Because all it can do now
is take him further from home.

46:04.063 --> 46:04.302
Yeah.

46:08.142 --> 46:11.702
'The irritating fact
was that after 660 miles

46:12.263 --> 46:20.822
'of abusive and wasteful driving,
the big twin-turbo Jag was telling
me it still had 135 miles to go.'

46:21.182 --> 46:27.502
Right, if I'm in this competition,
I'm in it to win it. Air-con off.

46:32.942 --> 46:37.102
'Now all of us thought we'd be
making the speech that night.'

46:37.502 --> 46:41.143
Good folk of Blackpool, it's a
delight, an honour and a pleasure.

46:41.542 --> 46:48.463
It gives me great pleasure
to be here tonight to turn on
your world famous illuminations.

46:49.663 --> 46:51.423
I declare these lights...on.

46:58.662 --> 47:03.382
I'd had a good lead over the others
but on the M42, trouble.

47:03.782 --> 47:07.463
RADIO: '..On the motorways. Caravans-
overturning on that stretch.'

47:07.703 --> 47:09.702
That's what I'm stuck in.

47:10.463 --> 47:13.783
People slowing down to look
at a caravan. Rightly so.

47:14.142 --> 47:17.343
I'd want to look at an overturned
caravan. There's nothing funnier.

47:17.462 --> 47:19.502
It's a big old queue.

47:19.623 --> 47:21.782
Four miles of this speed.

47:22.902 --> 47:26.423
Hammond's going to
be right on my tail.

47:27.863 --> 47:30.943
I might now try and catch him up,

47:31.342 --> 47:35.142
only to find as I catch him up
he runs out of diesel,
but I've used up

47:35.423 --> 47:38.983
all mine as well, so maybe I should-
be prepared to go slower than him

47:39.342 --> 47:41.303
and then overtake him
when he runs out.

47:41.582 --> 47:43.223
Kind of a hare and tortoise.

47:43.623 --> 47:46.222
No, that's a stupid idea.
I don't like it at all.

47:46.463 --> 47:48.023
I'm gonna go fast.

47:50.263 --> 47:51.582
The North. Excellent.

47:54.462 --> 47:56.702
I'm probably about 130 miles away.

47:56.942 --> 48:00.302
Computer says I can only do 90 miles.

48:00.662 --> 48:02.783
James thought he had problems.

48:03.623 --> 48:05.862
They were nothing compared to mine.

48:06.262 --> 48:13.183
OK, I've now got
an eighth of a tank to get me
from Birmingham to Blackpool.

48:14.382 --> 48:17.023
And then the news got worse.

48:17.462 --> 48:19.022
Hammond. Where are you?

48:19.142 --> 48:20.663
On the M6 toll. Where are you?

48:20.903 --> 48:22.463
On the M6 toll.

48:22.943 --> 48:23.863
HE LAUGHS

48:25.183 --> 48:27.823
We've closed up. What's your speed?

48:28.223 --> 48:32.462
70 at the moment. 70?
The ridiculous thing is
I've got twice as many

48:32.863 --> 48:38.303
cylinders and twice as many turbos,-
but I can't pull away from you.

48:39.863 --> 48:41.623
Meanwhile, far, far away...

48:42.422 --> 48:48.583
I can't believe it's gonna make it
now. That petrol gauge is so low.

48:48.823 --> 48:50.862
This is just appalling torture.

48:52.903 --> 48:54.542
I'm just sitting here,

48:54.823 --> 48:58.342
knowing that any minute now,
Hammond is going to come by.

48:58.503 --> 48:59.663
And then, disaster.

49:00.503 --> 49:01.823
Here I come.

49:02.143 --> 49:03.423
No! No, no!

49:04.743 --> 49:06.542
No, no, no. Hammond!

49:11.222 --> 49:13.823
I can't do anything about it!

49:14.823 --> 49:15.743
PHONE RINGS

49:16.223 --> 49:17.742
I've just seen somebody who

49:18.103 --> 49:21.422
looks just like you in a Jaguar
doing about 56 miles an hour.

49:21.703 --> 49:24.302
I am not going to race you. Really?

49:24.542 --> 49:24.742
No.

49:25.863 --> 49:30.863
I am going to sit behind you
and watch you fail.

49:31.262 --> 49:36.942
'And with Blackpool still
60 miles away, Jeremy was more
on the money than he realised.'

49:37.343 --> 49:44.262
I'm now gonna run out of diesel
40 miles away from Blackpool
according to this computer.

49:46.582 --> 49:52.142
With James far behind,
it was becoming a straight race
between Hammond and me.

49:52.543 --> 49:58.103
Both of us were running on fumes,
but I was staggered
the Jag had even got this far.

49:58.502 --> 50:02.303
Because
most of the way through France,
I was doing 80 miles an hour.

50:02.662 --> 50:05.262
I had the air-con on,
the radio on, I was charging phones.

50:05.663 --> 50:09.703
Most of the way through Britain,
I was doing 70.
It's been stop-start traffic.

50:10.063 --> 50:12.182
I haven't
been on an eco drive in this thing.

50:12.423 --> 50:14.462
Since Birmingham, neither had I.

50:14.702 --> 50:17.542
And now I was really
paying the price.

50:17.902 --> 50:20.782
The range computer
has just ticked over to zero.

50:20.983 --> 50:23.022
It's 36 miles to Blackpool.

50:23.383 --> 50:25.022
It's telling me nothing.

50:25.502 --> 50:25.823
Empty.

50:27.782 --> 50:31.343
Hammond won't make it.
James won't make it.

50:31.942 --> 50:33.582
God, this is tense.

50:34.303 --> 50:37.262
The fuel gauge says
I'm about to run out.

50:37.663 --> 50:43.742
Hypermiling techniques,
gentle on the throttle,
don't let it get to me. Stay calm.

50:47.623 --> 50:55.822
17.4 miles to go. It's telling me
I've got nothing left and I'm
just waiting for that cough.

50:56.702 --> 51:03.022
With the Stig baffled by human food-
and with 30 minutes to go before

51:03.263 --> 51:07.583
the big switch-on, I was agonising
over mounting a charge on Hammond.

51:07.823 --> 51:10.303
It's the stupidest,
cleverest race ever.

51:11.063 --> 51:16.502
I could easily beat him if I just
put my foot down, but I don't know
how much fuel is left in that tank.

51:16.622 --> 51:18.302
I love economy races.

51:22.022 --> 51:23.302
My final exit.

51:25.262 --> 51:29.023
I'm just doing everything I can.
Jeremy's behind.
I know he's taking it easy.

51:29.303 --> 51:32.983
He's not gonna take it that easy,
because...he's Jeremy.

51:33.382 --> 51:38.462
So, with 10 miles to go,
my range has finally reached 0.

51:38.983 --> 51:43.742
But still the magic Jag soldiers on.
And I've picked my speed up to 70.

51:43.982 --> 51:45.503
The race is on.

51:48.062 --> 51:52.223
'The question was,
could I catch him in time?'

51:52.463 --> 51:54.222
I'm four miles away.

51:55.182 --> 51:56.103
Come on.

51:57.422 --> 51:59.582
I can see Blackpool Tower!

52:01.023 --> 52:02.783
Oh, this is nerve-racking.

52:03.182 --> 52:06.583
If it dies now,
it'll be too much to bear.

52:06.742 --> 52:09.222
Range, 0. Fuel gauge, really empty.

52:13.383 --> 52:19.302
All I need now is to see a little
Volkswagen Polo with a little man
sobbing his eyes out next to it.

52:19.663 --> 52:22.982
Resetting trip computer B
for this fast stretch.

52:26.822 --> 52:28.823
Hello? I'm still moving. No, no!

52:28.982 --> 52:31.462
And I'll tell you something else.

52:31.862 --> 52:36.703
What? I've got about two miles left-
to go, but even better than that,
I have a police escort.

52:36.863 --> 52:38.863
You are having me on!

52:39.822 --> 52:42.462
One mile and I'm still moving.

52:42.942 --> 52:45.062
I've got nothing left at all.

52:45.343 --> 52:48.662
Oh, yes! I think I could be there!

52:55.983 --> 52:57.743
So Hammond had won.

53:00.062 --> 53:02.543
Single most tense thing
I've ever done.

53:02.783 --> 53:07.182
Less than a minute later,
I arrived too. I have made it.

53:07.343 --> 53:07.982
Hello, everybody.

53:08.743 --> 53:11.582
They appear to be cheering my Jag.

53:11.743 --> 53:13.742
And James May hasn't come.

53:14.222 --> 53:19.223
He doesn't like you. He doesn't
like anybody in the north.

53:20.543 --> 53:20.983
Congratulations.

53:25.223 --> 53:28.903
The world's second most
economical car! It's astonishing.

53:29.183 --> 53:33.062
How you kept that... I thought,
there's no way he can do it.

53:33.343 --> 53:36.983
There were just seconds to go
before the lights were switched on.

53:37.143 --> 53:37.943
Five. Four.

53:40.223 --> 53:41.982
Would James make it in time?

53:42.143 --> 53:43.942
53.7 miles per gallon average.

53:44.142 --> 53:45.662
I'm looking for 56.5...

53:46.983 --> 53:48.302
No, he wouldn't.

53:48.663 --> 53:49.823
Three, two, one!

53:52.223 --> 53:53.543
Pull the lever.

53:53.982 --> 53:56.743
You won the race. No, you should...

54:11.743 --> 54:13.022
Well done, you.

54:13.783 --> 54:18.183
All of that and then The Stig
stole my big moment.
I can't believe he did it.

54:18.422 --> 54:22.822
Yeah, well, some say he has
no understanding of queueing.

54:23.463 --> 54:28.782
Can I just say -
in case any of you are interested -
I did actually make it to Blackpool.

54:29.063 --> 54:31.302
Yes, you did, James, 40 minutes
after the ceremony was over.

54:31.822 --> 54:38.343
OK, I did make the mistake of going
too slowly, but nevertheless, I got
63 miles to the gallon out of that.

54:38.623 --> 54:40.982
It is amazing. I got 80 miles
to the gallon out of that.

54:41.383 --> 54:47.062
I want to know why would anybody
buy a Prius when this is seven
grand less and it uses less fuel?

54:47.463 --> 54:51.023
I did 17 hours in it and
when I got out the other end,
I wasn't even tired.

54:51.422 --> 54:56.143
We have to acknowledge though,
that the true hero
of this whole piece is that Jaguar.

54:56.583 --> 55:00.782
Couldn't agree more, and it's
better than you might think,
because we examined the fuel tank

55:01.183 --> 55:07.262
when we got to Blackpool
and found there was enough
left in it to do another 120 miles!

55:07.663 --> 55:15.743
If you think about it, 53 miles to
the gallon, 18.7 gallon fuel tank,
that's a range of 1,000 miles.

55:16.022 --> 55:18.863
1,000 miles between trips
to the pumps.

55:19.382 --> 55:22.943
And let's not forget,
the engine in this
was the same engine that was in

55:23.342 --> 55:26.982
the S-Type that took me around
the Nurburgring in less than ten
minutes. It is an amazing car.

55:27.223 --> 55:28.263
It's just incredible.

55:28.743 --> 55:30.502
Anyway, look... Yes, go.

55:30.902 --> 55:36.742
It's time to find out how fast the
Bugatti Veyron goes around our track.

55:36.942 --> 55:41.503
That means, of course, handing it
over to our tame racing driver.

55:41.623 --> 55:42.342
Some say...

55:43.703 --> 55:47.942
he has a stripy top just like mine.
Oh, come on, James.

55:48.343 --> 55:51.622
You really didn't fool anybody
with that. Not fooled anyone.

55:51.902 --> 55:53.663
No, this really is a big moment.

55:53.903 --> 55:55.543
A properly, properly big moment.

55:56.103 --> 55:59.982
In a few moments, we probably
will have a new leader
on our power lap board.

56:00.223 --> 56:02.582
The Bugatti Veyron. Let's find out.

56:03.182 --> 56:04.943
And he is off.

56:05.342 --> 56:07.462
Massive seamless
traction off the line.

56:07.742 --> 56:11.023
Massive seamless power
from the double clutch gearbox.

56:11.383 --> 56:13.022
Look at the air brake working there.

56:13.303 --> 56:17.222
That produces more stopping power
than the brakes on a normal car.

56:17.503 --> 56:20.303
Four-wheel drive grip
keeping it in line.

56:21.503 --> 56:22.822
Look at this.

56:23.182 --> 56:24.943
Cornering flat through Chicago.

56:26.063 --> 56:29.222
No drama,
apart from that tyre squeal.

56:30.103 --> 56:32.822
Hammerhead.
There's the A brake again.

56:33.182 --> 56:36.302
Listen to
the noise this thing makes.

56:41.582 --> 56:49.103
Right, now the Stig can really
wind up all 16 cylinders, all
four turbos, all 987 horsepower.

56:49.343 --> 56:51.342
Come on, Stig. Come on.

56:51.583 --> 56:52.742
This is important.

56:53.143 --> 56:57.182
Just two corners left.
Hard on the brakes again.

56:57.422 --> 56:59.183
Little bit of a wiggle.

56:59.582 --> 57:03.263
Come on, Stig. Greatest
piece of car engineering ever.

57:03.542 --> 57:05.382
Can it be the fastest
round our track?

57:05.742 --> 57:09.102
Glides it through Gambon
and across the line.

57:10.903 --> 57:15.303
It just looks so composed.
There's no drama in that thing.

57:15.423 --> 57:16.223
OK, everyone.

57:17.462 --> 57:21.503
This is it. This is the moment
that really every

57:21.902 --> 57:25.783
motoring enthusiast in the world
has been looking forward to
for years.

57:26.183 --> 57:30.583
Has the Veyron topped our board?
Is it quicker than the Gumpert?

57:30.822 --> 57:31.022
1.17.1.

57:34.503 --> 57:37.102
Well, it did it in 1...

57:42.971 --> 57:43.410
..18.3.

57:46.368 --> 57:48.128
It's the fourth fastest.

57:48.835 --> 57:51.554
I think it's too heavy to put
in the really, really fast time.

57:52.075 --> 57:55.435
I have to be honest,
I'm surprised it wasn't quickest.
I have to be honest with that.

57:57.154 --> 57:58.315
What? Chaps. Yes?

57:59.434 --> 58:00.674
The Zonda F,

58:02.154 --> 58:04.755
was it fixed in time to do a lap?
Yes, it was.

58:05.114 --> 58:07.474
Can we see that now, please?
Yes, we can. Good.

58:07.755 --> 58:10.594
Are we ready, ladies and
gentlemen, to see the Zonda? Yes!

58:10.835 --> 58:13.555
OK, play the tape. And he's off.

58:13.995 --> 58:19.875
A lot of wheelspin there,
because, of course, the Zonda
is only two-wheel drive.

58:22.315 --> 58:25.594
Remember, this roadster has 50
horsepower more than the coupe.

58:25.755 --> 58:28.234
So can it beat the hard-top's time?

58:28.594 --> 58:30.034
1.18.4. Still smoke, look.

58:32.915 --> 58:33.834
Here's Chicago.

58:35.195 --> 58:37.395
Looking a bit lively through
there and lively on the exit too.

58:39.115 --> 58:41.355
Looking a bit lively through
there and lively on the exit too.

58:42.394 --> 58:44.435
This car can be vicious.

58:44.834 --> 58:48.475
But in an amusing way,
like a shark in a funny hat.

58:49.035 --> 58:52.314
Getting a little bit sideways
around Hammerhead.
More smoke as well.

58:52.594 --> 58:55.035
Careful, Stig,
don't break it again!

58:55.315 --> 58:59.475
He really is wringing out
that Mercedes V12 now.

58:59.714 --> 59:03.394
Come on, into the second
to last corner.

59:04.115 --> 59:07.915
It does... It looks good,
I have to say. Then through Gambon.

59:08.194 --> 59:09.595
Massive slide and across the line.

59:17.128 --> 59:17.567
Ready?

59:20.488 --> 59:24.287
It did it... Yes? You really
think it'll be faster, don't you?

59:24.407 --> 59:25.568
God, yes. Yes.

59:26.767 --> 59:29.887
It did it in 1... Well, yes!

59:31.687 --> 59:34.447
17.8!
So straight away, it's above!

59:37.888 --> 59:38.848
Oh, yeah.

59:41.368 --> 59:43.968
So the mighty science lesson here

59:44.968 --> 59:49.327
enjoyed literally a minute
as the fourth fastest car
on our lap board, and then

59:49.727 --> 59:52.688
it was knocked off by the Zonda F,
the pantomime horse of a supercar.

59:52.848 --> 59:55.288
Do you know what this means?

59:55.687 --> 01:00:00.568
It means that for the first time
ever, we really can end on
a bombshell. See you next week.

01:00:00.807 --> 01:00:02.687
Thanks for watching. Good night!
