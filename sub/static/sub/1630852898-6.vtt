WEBVTT

00:12.066 --> 00:13.500
And hey, we’re
going to crown the first

00:13.533 --> 00:15.300
LOL Canada champ.

00:15.333 --> 00:17.200
Rated R for radical!

00:17.233 --> 00:20.200
Let’s fucking go!

00:28.333 --> 00:30.567
So, home stretch, we’re getting
close to the end here.

00:31.934 --> 00:33.500
You’ve all been great.

00:33.533 --> 00:36.300
Uh, but two of you have
failed to eliminate anyone.

00:39.233 --> 00:43.700
At the one hour mark, if neither
of you makes someone laugh,

00:43.734 --> 00:46.100
you’re out of the game
and will join me

00:46.133 --> 00:47.567
and the others in the lodge.

00:47.600 --> 00:49.000
Ooh.

00:49.033 --> 00:49.967
Good luck.

00:52.200 --> 00:54.000
Oh.

00:59.900 --> 01:02.066
I thought the doors would close.

01:06.533 --> 01:08.400
After four and
a half grueling hours,

01:08.433 --> 01:11.500
Tom and Colin have fucking
brutalised half the cast.

01:11.533 --> 01:14.066
Brandon and Andrew have
their work cut out for them

01:14.100 --> 01:16.100
to coax a laugh
in the next thirty minutes.

01:16.133 --> 01:18.934
Gear up for the knockout round!

01:20.166 --> 01:21.800
You know it’s my
birthday tomorrow.

01:21.834 --> 01:22.800
Is it?

01:22.834 --> 01:23.934
Yeah, I turn 50.

01:23.967 --> 01:25.934
Oh, I could tell you stuff.

01:25.967 --> 01:29.033
If you’d told me that I’d be
doing this when I was 50...

01:29.066 --> 01:30.567
Yeah.

01:30.600 --> 01:32.367
I probably would have
drowned myself.

01:37.266 --> 01:39.633
Okay.

01:43.233 --> 01:46.934
Okay. So what we’re gonna do...

01:46.967 --> 01:48.200
Oh, here we go.

01:48.233 --> 01:48.967
I just want to show you...

01:49.000 --> 01:49.934
Yeah.

01:49.967 --> 01:52.467
...how I got so beautiful.

01:52.500 --> 01:54.033
None of us were making
each other laugh.

01:54.066 --> 01:55.200
So when the rule came up,

01:55.233 --> 01:56.700
the pressure was on.

01:56.734 --> 01:58.433
I am supposed to be here.
I’ve earned this spot.

01:58.467 --> 02:00.300
I’m ready to work.

02:00.333 --> 02:02.033
These heads gotta roll.

02:02.066 --> 02:03.834
This is my moisturizing routine.

02:03.867 --> 02:05.867
Alright.
Moisturizing, okay.

02:05.900 --> 02:08.033
Oh shit.

02:08.066 --> 02:09.667
Oooh.

02:11.734 --> 02:12.967
Oooh.

02:13.000 --> 02:14.600
Yeah.

02:14.633 --> 02:16.066
Oooh.

02:28.600 --> 02:29.467
Okay.

02:32.467 --> 02:33.333
Whoa.

02:34.734 --> 02:36.066
You know of all
the gay porno I’ve seen

02:36.100 --> 02:37.600
this is by far the worst.

02:39.834 --> 02:41.467
He’s going for it, though.

02:41.500 --> 02:43.200
Well, you can’t fault him.

02:43.233 --> 02:46.033
I like a lot of things rough,
but my skin isn’t one of them.

02:47.100 --> 02:48.333
Gotcha.

02:48.367 --> 02:50.100
Do it up. Do it up.

02:50.133 --> 02:51.667
Oooh. Uh.

02:51.700 --> 02:54.400
Do you feel like I’m
sufficiently moisturised enough?

02:54.433 --> 02:55.700
It’s really your choice.

02:57.066 --> 02:59.066
Oooh.

02:59.100 --> 03:00.233
Woo.

03:02.600 --> 03:03.433
Whoa.

03:03.467 --> 03:04.300
Oh!

03:04.333 --> 03:05.834
Holy shit!

03:05.867 --> 03:07.734
That sounded like
he cracked his knees.

03:07.767 --> 03:10.033
That was wild.

03:10.066 --> 03:11.000
I would have laughed,
there’s no way.

03:12.500 --> 03:13.433
That was incredible.

03:13.467 --> 03:15.133
Thank you.

03:15.166 --> 03:17.166
Yeah, I liked when you
slathered yourself in the,

03:17.200 --> 03:19.033
in the white creamy liquid.

03:19.066 --> 03:19.934
Thank you.

03:19.967 --> 03:20.667
Yeah.

03:22.367 --> 03:23.600
I figured
if I’d gone through Tom

03:23.633 --> 03:25.367
in a Gorilla costume...

03:25.400 --> 03:28.467
I can go through a guy covering
himself with moisturizer.

03:32.633 --> 03:34.166
- Thank you.
- It was good.

03:34.200 --> 03:37.066
That was...
That was something.

03:37.100 --> 03:39.900
I tell ya Brandon,
I’m guessing right now

03:39.934 --> 03:40.867
his clothes are just
falling off of him

03:40.900 --> 03:42.133
’cause he’s so moisturized.

03:43.266 --> 03:44.600
Colin said

03:44.633 --> 03:46.066
when you forget
you’re playing the game

03:46.100 --> 03:47.600
you let your guard down.

03:47.633 --> 03:49.567
I’m thinking what if I could
get Colin to forget

03:49.600 --> 03:50.734
he was playing the game.

03:50.767 --> 03:52.934
Same with Brandon.
Same with Tom.

03:54.400 --> 03:55.800
How ’bout you Colin?

03:55.834 --> 03:57.667
As an undetected serial killer.

03:57.700 --> 03:58.967
Yeah.

03:59.000 --> 04:00.533
Have you ever stopped yourself

04:00.567 --> 04:03.300
before uploading your DNA
to Ancestry.com?

04:03.333 --> 04:05.533
Oh, absolutely.

04:07.800 --> 04:09.266
That’s funny.

04:09.300 --> 04:10.734
Let’s go Phung, let’s do this.

04:12.333 --> 04:16.200
It’s a cute little baby,
I’m just a little baby.

04:19.133 --> 04:22.133
I’m just a little baby, you
know, I’m just a little baby.

04:22.166 --> 04:23.967
Oh!

04:24.000 --> 04:26.133
I don’t know what I’m doing.
I’m a little baby.

04:26.166 --> 04:27.633
Oh boy.

04:27.667 --> 04:30.166
I’m in a studio all by myself.

04:30.200 --> 04:32.266
Tom!
Look at his face!

04:35.934 --> 04:37.533
That was fairly odd,
I gotta say.

04:37.567 --> 04:40.667
I actually want to laugh
but we’re not allowed to laugh.

04:43.867 --> 04:45.166
I think I’m gonna go slip
into something

04:45.200 --> 04:48.300
a little more comfortable...
an iron maiden.

04:48.333 --> 04:49.533
An iron maiden.

04:50.700 --> 04:51.633
Oh my gosh.

04:54.166 --> 04:56.667
I don’t know
what’s funny anymore.

04:56.700 --> 04:58.967
Looks like Andrew’s
feeling the pressure.

04:59.000 --> 05:01.000
I feel like
I can’t make them laugh.

05:01.033 --> 05:03.266
These three I just like don’t
know, I’ve tried everything.

05:03.300 --> 05:04.934
Okay.

05:04.967 --> 05:06.667
Time’s almost fucking up, boys.

05:06.700 --> 05:08.934
Pucks on the net,
that’s all I’m asking for.

05:08.967 --> 05:12.033
At this point in the game,
I am so desperate.

05:12.066 --> 05:13.467
I just wanna show
you a photo.

05:13.500 --> 05:14.667
We’ve heard about
underprivileged kids.

05:14.700 --> 05:16.100
Well, these kids are overprivileged.

05:16.133 --> 05:17.100
Oh.

05:17.133 --> 05:18.400
So I’m helping a charity

05:18.433 --> 05:20.033
that will
de-privilege these children.

05:20.066 --> 05:21.500
We’re gonna go
into these neighbourhoods

05:21.533 --> 05:23.734
and these homes and
de-privilege them.

05:23.767 --> 05:26.000
So you gonna rob them?

05:28.533 --> 05:30.166
Honestly,
I have to, like, focus.

05:30.200 --> 05:32.033
I am ready to slay
until the end.

05:32.066 --> 05:36.633
Ooh, ooh, ooh.

05:36.667 --> 05:39.066
I’m going bananas.
Oh my God.

05:40.633 --> 05:43.100
Porn parodies I feel
like might make you laugh.

05:43.133 --> 05:44.500
Possibly.

05:44.533 --> 05:46.433
Sperminator.

05:46.467 --> 05:48.133
What about
Shaving Ryan’s Privates?

05:48.166 --> 05:52.066
What about Titanic... Cock?

05:54.567 --> 05:56.367
There were so many "almosts".

05:56.400 --> 05:59.166
We were all on the edge
of our seats.

05:59.200 --> 06:01.533
Here we go. The last
two minutes here, boys.

06:01.567 --> 06:03.367
You’re here talking
about your new show?

06:03.400 --> 06:04.433
Tell me about it.

06:04.467 --> 06:05.500
It’s called Colin Mochrie.

06:05.533 --> 06:07.166
Oh.

06:07.200 --> 06:10.200
I had to live as a dainty,
bald, white man for...

06:10.233 --> 06:12.300
- Yeah.
- ...about six years.

06:12.333 --> 06:14.033
Unlock the trauma.
What was that like?

06:14.066 --> 06:17.533
It was really devastating.

06:21.166 --> 06:23.300
I’m really
finding this riveting.

06:23.333 --> 06:24.934
Okay, here we go.
Here we go.

06:26.433 --> 06:27.934
I assume they
don’t have a countdown clock

06:27.967 --> 06:30.033
in most torture chambers.

06:30.066 --> 06:31.000
Probably not.

06:32.333 --> 06:34.100
Oh, I’m so sorry.

06:38.233 --> 06:39.333
Uh oh.

06:42.600 --> 06:44.967
Oh no, no, no, no, no.

06:49.500 --> 06:51.567
All right.

06:51.600 --> 06:53.800
Uh-oh.

06:53.834 --> 06:56.033
Brandon, what the fuck is that?

06:56.066 --> 06:57.367
Areola Grande.

06:59.800 --> 07:01.967
You’ve all been very funny.

07:02.000 --> 07:04.834
This is not something
I wanted to have to do,

07:04.867 --> 07:06.900
but we are down
to the one hour mark.

07:08.867 --> 07:12.066
Colin, you took
Debra and Jon out.

07:12.100 --> 07:15.967
Tom, you took out Dave,
Mae and Trevor.

07:16.000 --> 07:18.900
So, you are the final two.

07:18.934 --> 07:20.967
Brandon and Andrew,
I am so sorry,

07:21.000 --> 07:23.633
you were great
but your time is up.

07:25.433 --> 07:27.400
Unfortunately, you will
have to come back

07:27.433 --> 07:30.533
to the lodge with me and
the other resentful comics.

07:30.567 --> 07:32.934
Aww.

07:32.967 --> 07:35.900
Tom and Colin, good luck!

07:35.934 --> 07:37.000
Oh.

07:39.266 --> 07:41.500
None of you could break me,
remember that.

07:41.533 --> 07:43.367
Give me love.
Bye, Colin.

07:43.400 --> 07:46.467
You were a warrior, man.
It’s not fair.

07:46.500 --> 07:48.333
I was disappointed,
like I really wanted

07:48.367 --> 07:49.567
to take home money
for my charity.

07:49.600 --> 07:51.133
But at the end of the day,

07:51.166 --> 07:53.333
to go toe to toe with
the great ones,

07:53.367 --> 07:57.266
it did feel like a career
highlight to me. It was awesome.

07:57.300 --> 07:59.100
Unbreakable, though.

07:59.133 --> 08:01.033
Oh, oh.

08:01.066 --> 08:02.367
Unbreakable!

08:02.400 --> 08:04.000
You almost got me, though.

08:04.033 --> 08:06.033
- In the bathroom!
- You almost fucking got me.

08:06.066 --> 08:07.567
Aww, I knew it.

08:07.600 --> 08:08.834
I was a little bummed...

08:08.867 --> 08:10.633
..and then when I
got to the lodge.

08:10.667 --> 08:12.166
I was like, oh, this is nice.

08:12.200 --> 08:13.934
I wish I got eliminated
way earlier.

08:15.700 --> 08:18.166
Here’s the thing. If it was
just me laughing, we’d be good.

08:18.200 --> 08:19.700
Yeah. Yeah.

08:19.734 --> 08:21.834
Because you guys made me laugh
in here, in a big way.

08:21.867 --> 08:24.600
It’s lights out
for Brandon and Andrew

08:24.633 --> 08:27.266
so it comes down
to the final two:

08:27.300 --> 08:29.533
Colin Mochrie versus Tom Green.

08:31.233 --> 08:33.533
Both these comedy icons
have yellow cards

08:33.567 --> 08:36.100
so whoever breaks next, loses.

08:36.133 --> 08:40.266
- Whoever holds on wins 100
- K for their charity.

08:40.300 --> 08:44.066
Place your bets... babies!

08:44.100 --> 08:46.266
Oh shit.
It’s sudden death here.

08:46.300 --> 08:49.300
This is an epic battle
of two icons.

08:49.333 --> 08:51.967
Tom Green and Colin Mochrie.

08:52.000 --> 08:54.667
Canadian legends
who are known

08:54.700 --> 08:58.633
for keeping a straight face
in the midst of insanity.

08:58.667 --> 09:00.066
This could go either way.

09:00.100 --> 09:01.233
Ready?

09:01.266 --> 09:03.000
- Okay, here we go.
- Here we go.

09:03.033 --> 09:05.967
This is it.
The final two!

09:06.000 --> 09:07.100
I respect and love as
a person...

09:08.066 --> 09:09.133
...and a performer.

09:09.166 --> 09:10.400
Oh thank you, thank you. Okay.

09:10.433 --> 09:12.433
Next one who laughs... loses.

09:17.200 --> 09:19.100
I’m a little nervous about
this because there was

09:19.133 --> 09:22.166
several times today,
I nearly lost it

09:22.200 --> 09:26.066
with some of your outrageous
physical thrusting antics.

09:26.100 --> 09:27.300
I know, but I can’t
just go over there

09:27.333 --> 09:28.934
and start thrusting
at the table.

09:28.967 --> 09:32.000
I’m so bruised down there,
I’m worried what’ll happen.

09:36.266 --> 09:37.734
I made it to the end...

09:37.767 --> 09:41.166
The slapstick showdown with
Colin Mochrie and myself.

09:41.200 --> 09:43.567
A showdown!

09:43.600 --> 09:45.133
At comedy corral.

09:45.166 --> 09:47.133
Last One Laughing.

09:47.166 --> 09:48.900
Loses.

09:48.934 --> 09:52.400
Wins! I know the concept
of the game.

09:52.433 --> 09:54.100
I’ve only had one glass, are
you gonna have another glass?

09:54.133 --> 09:55.600
- I’ll have another glass.
- Okay.

09:55.633 --> 09:56.967
Because at this point,
I don’t, I truly don’t care...

09:57.000 --> 09:58.300
Yeah, at this point,
let’s just...

09:58.333 --> 10:00.033
I’m just enjoying
your company.

10:00.066 --> 10:03.133
We started off with ten people
and now it’s just me and Tom.

10:03.166 --> 10:05.700
I love Tom, he’s very funny.

10:05.734 --> 10:08.567
He’s gonna be
very difficult to beat

10:08.600 --> 10:10.533
because he’s truly unpredictable.

10:10.567 --> 10:12.433
- Good luck to you, my dear.
- Cheers, my friend, cheers.

10:12.467 --> 10:13.633
One of them is gonna
get a hundred thousand

10:13.667 --> 10:15.367
for their charity.

10:15.400 --> 10:17.633
Colin’s charity is the,
uh, "Stop the Steal" fund

10:17.667 --> 10:19.100
for Donald Trump.

10:22.734 --> 10:24.100
Oh, someone’s at the door.

10:24.133 --> 10:26.033
Oh. Oh my gosh, really?

10:26.066 --> 10:28.033
We’ve got more
special guests, do we?

10:28.066 --> 10:29.934
It’s Al Waxman back
from the dead.

10:36.533 --> 10:38.300
- Okay.
- Oh, hello.

10:38.333 --> 10:39.800
From Schitt’s Creek.

10:39.834 --> 10:42.467
Ah, that is Karen Robinson
from Schitt’s Creek.

10:42.500 --> 10:43.934
- Hello.
- Hello.

10:43.967 --> 10:45.467
My name is Karen Robinson.

10:45.500 --> 10:47.266
Hello, Karen.

10:47.300 --> 10:50.133
...and I am one of the Amazon
Executives for this show.

10:50.166 --> 10:51.400
Are we fired?

10:51.433 --> 10:52.767
Wait for it.

10:55.433 --> 10:57.467
I wanna congratulate
both of you

10:57.500 --> 11:00.633
on being our
final two comedians.

11:00.667 --> 11:02.333
Clap yourselves!

11:02.367 --> 11:03.400
Thank you.

11:03.433 --> 11:04.567
Clap yourselves!

11:04.600 --> 11:06.133
Clapping.

11:08.033 --> 11:09.467
Okay, stop.

11:09.500 --> 11:13.000
Now, those other people back
there, bless their hearts,

11:13.033 --> 11:15.633
they got their sorry
asses kicked off this show.

11:15.667 --> 11:16.533
Rude.

11:18.200 --> 11:19.600
But they are the foundation
for your success.

11:19.633 --> 11:20.834
Absolutely.

11:20.867 --> 11:25.467
So we thank them.
We thank them for their effort.

11:25.500 --> 11:27.367
It’s about fucking time.

11:28.667 --> 11:30.367
And we thank them
for their failure.

11:30.400 --> 11:31.633
Yeah.

11:31.667 --> 11:33.266
- Mmm.
- Okay.

11:33.300 --> 11:34.333
We should take a look.

11:40.567 --> 11:42.266
Aww, it’s the In Memoriam.

11:42.300 --> 11:43.333
Yeah.

11:53.433 --> 11:54.567
Oh God.

11:54.600 --> 11:56.600
-
- Please stop now.

11:56.633 --> 11:58.133
The “In Memoriam”, every year...

11:58.166 --> 12:00.700
I’m always so delighted
to not be on it.

12:00.734 --> 12:02.433
Now I’ve actually
experienced it.

12:04.867 --> 12:05.934
This is awful.

12:22.000 --> 12:23.000
Aww.

12:26.000 --> 12:29.066
Yes. Yes, that’s...
I want my memory to be that.

12:35.133 --> 12:37.934
A lovely montage,
a lovely tribute.

12:37.967 --> 12:39.133
Woo.

12:39.166 --> 12:40.467
Those were good times,
you guys.

12:40.500 --> 12:41.300
Those were really good times.

12:41.333 --> 12:42.533
A really good time.

12:42.567 --> 12:44.633
Does anyone know what year
it is back on earth?

12:47.300 --> 12:48.367
Good luck to both of you.

12:48.400 --> 12:49.166
- Thank you.
- Aww.

12:49.200 --> 12:50.467
I’m gonna go, goodbye.

12:50.500 --> 12:51.400
- Yeah. Okay.
- Thank you so much.

12:51.433 --> 12:52.433
So great seeing ya.

12:52.467 --> 12:53.834
It was pretty cool to see...

12:53.867 --> 12:55.900
...an Executive from Amazon.

12:55.934 --> 12:57.133
Oh, she’s not!

12:57.166 --> 12:58.467
Wasn’t Jeff Bezos,
I know that.

13:03.433 --> 13:05.133
Should we have
a shot of scotch?

13:05.166 --> 13:07.100
Um, alright, I
will have scotch

13:07.133 --> 13:08.233
even though I’m not
a scotch drinker.

13:08.266 --> 13:09.400
Uh-oh.

13:09.433 --> 13:11.033
Oh my God, Colin!

13:11.066 --> 13:14.333
I know it was a risk but
um, maybe Colin might

13:14.367 --> 13:15.567
let his guard down
a little bit there.

13:15.600 --> 13:17.400
Okay.

13:17.433 --> 13:19.433
Colin, hey? What do you say we
go have a scotch there, eh?

13:19.467 --> 13:20.667
Let’s get ’er done.

13:20.700 --> 13:22.233
Let’s get ’er done
there, eh, bud?

13:24.133 --> 13:25.200
- Cheers, sir.
- Oh Jesus.

13:25.233 --> 13:26.300
Oh.

13:26.333 --> 13:27.400
That’s a big dram of scotch.

13:27.433 --> 13:29.066
That’s too much for a shot.

13:29.100 --> 13:31.100
Yeah, they’re gonna
be shittered.

13:31.133 --> 13:33.033
- Cheers to everyone watching...
- Cheers to everyone.

13:33.066 --> 13:34.600
...around the world.

13:34.633 --> 13:36.667
Oh God. God, God,
God, God. Oh Jesus.

13:36.700 --> 13:37.967
Oh! There he goes.

13:38.000 --> 13:40.300
Oh boy.

13:40.333 --> 13:43.033
That’s nice. That is nice.

13:43.066 --> 13:44.333
Ho!

13:44.367 --> 13:46.000
Yeah. No.

13:46.033 --> 13:49.934
- That is nice.
- It...yep.

13:49.967 --> 13:51.233
Do we wanna have another shot?

13:51.266 --> 13:52.367
Or do we wanna
go out like that?

13:52.400 --> 13:53.967
- Oh my God, alright!
- Yeah.

13:54.000 --> 13:57.200
I think that Tom has made a
genius move with the scotch.

13:57.233 --> 13:58.633
To loosen up Colin?

13:58.667 --> 14:00.066
Well, he knows Colin
doesn’t really drink,

14:00.100 --> 14:01.033
he might have lost
his edge a little bit.

14:01.066 --> 14:01.967
Yeah.

14:02.000 --> 14:04.834
That’s a good fucking point.

14:04.867 --> 14:06.700
I’m so glad I didn’t
drive here.

14:06.734 --> 14:08.033
Yeah.

14:08.066 --> 14:09.266
They’re gonna fucking ralph.

14:09.300 --> 14:10.834
Yeah, Colin might ralph.

14:14.967 --> 14:16.633
Oh, fuck, Colin.

14:16.667 --> 14:19.133
That one went down smooth, eh?

14:19.166 --> 14:20.567
The whisky...

14:20.600 --> 14:22.000
...could be a mistake.

14:22.033 --> 14:23.500
I was quite light headed.

14:23.533 --> 14:26.100
I was still trying to focus
on the thing

14:26.133 --> 14:28.200
and also making sure
I wasn’t slurring.

14:28.233 --> 14:31.300
We have to remember I’m a role
model to young people.

14:31.333 --> 14:32.200
Uh-huh.

14:32.233 --> 14:34.033
And can I just say

14:34.066 --> 14:37.667
how difficult it was to say
the words “role model”.

14:40.367 --> 14:42.967
Oh yeah.
We’re wasted.

14:43.000 --> 14:45.166
Yeah, but you know what,
we’re having fun.

14:45.200 --> 14:46.667
Yes.

14:46.700 --> 14:49.533
I’ve really not had a craving
for alcohol in six years...

14:49.567 --> 14:51.100
until today.

14:54.700 --> 14:56.100
Now, I’m guessing at some point,

14:56.133 --> 14:57.000
they’re gonna make
us do something.

14:57.033 --> 14:58.433
Right.

14:58.467 --> 15:00.166
That will make us laugh.
Good luck to you, my friend.

15:00.200 --> 15:02.200
Cheers, my friend. Cheers.

15:02.233 --> 15:04.300
Or maybe they just
won’t do anything?

15:04.333 --> 15:06.467
Oh, they don’t fucking think
we’re gonna do anything, eh?

15:06.500 --> 15:09.600
Trevor and Caroline, get
in there and fucking mix it up.

15:09.633 --> 15:12.000
- Okay.
- Alright, good luck.

15:12.033 --> 15:14.600
Perhaps the gag is,
it never ends.

15:14.633 --> 15:16.100
So it’s like Groundhog Day.

15:16.133 --> 15:17.233
Uh huh.

15:17.266 --> 15:19.166
It just keeps happening
over and over again

15:19.200 --> 15:21.533
but no Andie MacDowell,
it’s us.

15:22.667 --> 15:24.233
Hello?

15:24.266 --> 15:28.300
Hello? Um, so, have you
ever been at a concert

15:28.333 --> 15:29.500
trying to have a conversation...

15:29.533 --> 15:31.333
and then right when
the music stops

15:31.367 --> 15:34.500
you realise you just shouted out
something really embarrassing?

15:34.533 --> 15:36.934
Well, that’s the gist
of this next bit

15:36.967 --> 15:38.233
called Concert Talkers.

15:41.567 --> 15:42.967
I can hear the sound coming...

15:43.000 --> 15:44.433
- Oh I see, oh okay!
- There we go.

15:44.467 --> 15:45.400
Oh look.

15:47.667 --> 15:49.367
Hey, hello you two.

15:52.567 --> 15:54.333
I guess we’re not explaining
the rules of the game,

15:54.367 --> 15:56.934
we’re just talking and
wait for them to cut it out

15:56.967 --> 15:57.600
and say something really loud.

15:59.200 --> 16:01.133
He says they were penis moles,
is that a thing?

16:07.333 --> 16:09.433
And then I put my balls
in a laminator.

16:12.633 --> 16:14.700
I’m not in the game,
I can laugh.

16:14.734 --> 16:16.000
Ha ha!

16:16.967 --> 16:18.266
Caroline and Trevor,

16:18.300 --> 16:21.700
they’d come out
to make us laugh.

16:21.734 --> 16:23.800
But Caroline was
the first one to go.

16:23.834 --> 16:25.200
Why’d they send you?

16:25.233 --> 16:28.533
It’s like sending David’s
brother against Goliath.

16:28.567 --> 16:30.300
She won’t watch this,
will she?

16:33.734 --> 16:35.200
I would have sex with Tom Green

16:35.233 --> 16:36.433
and I didn’t think
I’d say that before.

16:38.266 --> 16:39.834
Ah!

16:39.867 --> 16:40.734
I like that.

16:44.734 --> 16:46.934
Yes, they are real.

16:50.066 --> 16:51.166
He’s teetering.

16:56.000 --> 16:58.367
I have really bad hemorrhoids.

17:04.300 --> 17:06.000
This did not work
like we thought

17:06.033 --> 17:07.934
it was going to backstage.

17:07.967 --> 17:09.300
I gotta say you lasted longer

17:09.333 --> 17:11.033
than you did
in the original part.

17:11.066 --> 17:12.467
You know what?

17:15.000 --> 17:17.000
I do hope Tom wins.

17:18.567 --> 17:21.734
Ooh, hee hee hee!

17:21.767 --> 17:25.433
Alright guys, no takers.
This bit’s over.

17:25.467 --> 17:26.500
Oh, bye.

17:28.300 --> 17:29.266
My foot!

17:32.600 --> 17:34.400
I crossed my leg.

17:36.000 --> 17:37.533
Ah heavens.

17:51.867 --> 17:57.000
I don’t know why I think
hurting myself will get a laugh.

17:57.033 --> 17:58.266
Uh, give it a try.

18:02.834 --> 18:04.400
- That’s never not funny.
- Yeah.

18:04.433 --> 18:05.934
No.

18:05.967 --> 18:07.600
That’s a nice wedding ring
you have there.

18:07.633 --> 18:10.667
Yeah, I just realised that’s
going to leave a big mark.

18:10.700 --> 18:13.667
I had a wedding ring once
too, it left a mark as well.

18:13.700 --> 18:16.633
Are we getting into some kind
of territory we shouldn’t?

18:16.667 --> 18:18.100
- Probably.
- Alright.

18:25.100 --> 18:26.734
This is really tricky.

18:26.767 --> 18:28.767
My natural instinct
is to laugh at

18:28.800 --> 18:30.300
every single thing
that comes

18:30.333 --> 18:31.333
out of your mouth, sir, because...

18:31.367 --> 18:33.000
Yeah.

18:33.033 --> 18:34.000
...I just like, I honestly,
uh, you know, uh, uh...

18:34.033 --> 18:35.633
So why are you fighting it?

18:35.667 --> 18:37.633
Wouldn’t you feel better
if you just laughed?

18:37.667 --> 18:39.533
You could hang out with
those guys out there.

18:39.567 --> 18:41.367
Oh no!

18:41.400 --> 18:42.533
Oh my God.

18:42.567 --> 18:44.233
This is when he does his thing.

18:44.266 --> 18:46.266
You could have a couple
of drinks, have some laughs,

18:46.300 --> 18:47.834
have some fun.

18:47.867 --> 18:50.900
You can forget about all
the pressures that’s happening.

18:53.066 --> 18:55.934
Oh.
Uh oh. Don’t do it Tom!

18:55.967 --> 18:57.433
- Oh yeah, I see a smirk.
- Hold on.

18:57.467 --> 18:59.166
Trevor will give you a
nice little neck massage.

18:59.200 --> 19:00.266
Mmm-hmm.

19:01.734 --> 19:04.367
Mae will give you a
delicious cheese sandwich.

19:04.400 --> 19:05.500
Oh.

19:05.533 --> 19:07.300
Brandon will moisturize you.

19:07.333 --> 19:08.166
Oh, I mean I’m down.

19:09.467 --> 19:10.233
I’m down.

19:13.066 --> 19:15.166
Aww, Tom is on the edge.

19:15.200 --> 19:16.667
Yes, he is.
He’s on the fucking cliff.

19:16.700 --> 19:18.800
Hey! Do you wanna see my
64-year-old toddler?

19:21.333 --> 19:22.967
Tom!

19:26.000 --> 19:26.934
Oh my gosh.

19:29.200 --> 19:30.967
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

19:33.867 --> 19:36.333
I’m not gonna cheat by
diverting my gaze. Okay?

19:43.500 --> 19:45.300
Tom needs to now
go on the offensive,

19:45.333 --> 19:46.667
he’s, like, receiving it.

19:46.700 --> 19:48.000
Yeah, yeah.

19:48.033 --> 19:51.900
How bout you teach me
the 64-year-old toddler.

19:51.934 --> 19:53.233
Okay. What do I do here?

19:53.266 --> 19:57.033
Lean kinda forward so your,
um, weight is in,

19:57.066 --> 19:59.934
because, you know, toddlers
they don’t really have their...

19:59.967 --> 20:01.667
yeah, that’s it.

20:01.700 --> 20:04.133
And then you, at some point
you just pick up speed.

20:05.633 --> 20:06.867
This is the most amazing thing.

20:06.900 --> 20:08.467
This is fucking insane.

20:08.500 --> 20:11.433
The 64-year-old toddler.

20:11.467 --> 20:13.000
Okay. You gotta have
the hands a little more...

20:14.967 --> 20:18.233
I’m watching Colin Mochrie teach
physical comedy to Tom Green.

20:18.266 --> 20:19.567
It’s pretty cool.

20:19.600 --> 20:22.066
Some joy, through the eyes.
Like wonder.

20:22.100 --> 20:23.400
Joy and wonder.

20:23.433 --> 20:25.033
Tom Green and Colin Mochrie

20:25.066 --> 20:27.667
pushing back and
forth at each other.

20:27.700 --> 20:30.433
It’s like fencing with comedy.

20:30.467 --> 20:32.367
Okay.
Come.

20:37.100 --> 20:39.000
That’s something you would
pay a lot of money to see.

20:39.033 --> 20:40.967
Like I would just
throw cash at that.

20:45.200 --> 20:46.600
We need another shot.

20:53.200 --> 20:54.367
Do you want some cheese?

20:54.400 --> 20:56.934
Uh, yes please.
Thank you very much.

20:56.967 --> 20:58.233
You’re welcome.

20:58.266 --> 21:00.166
Absolutely. Are we going
to eat cheese now?

21:00.200 --> 21:02.000
- What the hell?
- Absolutely.

21:02.033 --> 21:04.500
Alright, let’s make
things difficult

21:04.533 --> 21:06.166
for these old drunkards.

21:06.200 --> 21:07.533
I like where this is going.

21:07.567 --> 21:09.433
Alright guys,
it’s me Jay Baruchel.

21:09.467 --> 21:11.000
You might know me
from some bank commercials...

21:11.033 --> 21:12.467
- Oh yeah.
- ...a few years back.

21:12.500 --> 21:15.567
So the time has come to dance.

21:15.600 --> 21:16.934
Fuck.

21:16.967 --> 21:18.967
Dance until the music stops.

21:19.000 --> 21:20.467
- Dance?
- You get the gist of it.

21:25.800 --> 21:28.967
Slow dance together. Come on.

21:29.000 --> 21:30.967
I think they want us
to do a slow dance.

21:34.400 --> 21:35.900
This is true love.

21:37.767 --> 21:39.633
We finally found what
makes Brandon laugh.

21:39.667 --> 21:40.800
Oh my God.

21:43.967 --> 21:46.333
You’re a very gentle dancer.

21:46.367 --> 21:48.400
Our breathing
became like one,

21:48.433 --> 21:50.133
we sort of calmed
each other down.

21:50.166 --> 21:52.767
Okay, it’s getting weird now,
but it was a nice moment.

21:54.300 --> 21:57.266
- Grab his ass!
- Grab his ass!

21:57.300 --> 21:59.900
- Grab his ass.
- Tom!

21:59.934 --> 22:02.133
I’m thinking
if I lower my hand

22:02.166 --> 22:04.734
a little on to
the buttock region,

22:04.767 --> 22:06.500
maybe that will get a laugh.

22:06.533 --> 22:08.233
Uh-oh!

22:08.266 --> 22:10.867
But I didn’t feel like
I had the right to

22:10.900 --> 22:15.200
place my hand upon
his supple buttocks.

22:20.567 --> 22:22.200
This is beautiful.

22:22.233 --> 22:24.033
This is a really nice
way to end.

22:24.066 --> 22:25.367
It actually really is.

22:32.233 --> 22:33.967
What is that move?

22:34.000 --> 22:35.133
I like it.

22:41.100 --> 22:43.600
Please let them stop now.

22:43.633 --> 22:45.066
Tell me you
guys are getting this

22:45.100 --> 22:46.667
in two hundred
frames per second.

23:03.300 --> 23:05.467
So good.

23:05.500 --> 23:08.533
I could watch Colin and Tom
for about ten more hours.

23:08.567 --> 23:10.066
That was beautiful.

23:10.100 --> 23:12.100
- It was beautiful.
- It was beautiful.

23:12.133 --> 23:13.000
I think it told a story.

23:14.133 --> 23:15.734
I think it told a story.

23:15.767 --> 23:18.533
I’ve thought about that.
What happened there with you.

23:18.567 --> 23:20.066
Oh!

23:20.100 --> 23:21.967
Some people wish for yachts
or private jets,

23:22.000 --> 23:26.367
I wish for a romantic dance
with one of my comedy heroes.

23:26.400 --> 23:27.633
- Thank you, sir.
- Thank you.

23:27.667 --> 23:29.166
Yeah.

23:29.200 --> 23:30.300
That wasn’t unearnest
either, like.

23:30.333 --> 23:32.266
- No, it was beautiful.
- Lovely.

23:32.300 --> 23:33.467
It felt sincere.

23:33.500 --> 23:34.667
Sometimes the final is,
like, as marquee

23:34.700 --> 23:36.633
as you’d hope it would be.

23:36.667 --> 23:38.433
Colin Mochrie and Tom Green,

23:38.467 --> 23:41.367
each of whom are
masters at what they do.

23:41.400 --> 23:44.600
Getting to watch them
go against one another:

23:44.633 --> 23:45.800
dream come true.

23:45.834 --> 23:47.600
Such, uh, an honour
to be here today.

23:47.633 --> 23:49.934
I think it’s worked
out beautifully.

23:49.967 --> 23:51.367
Well, I guess we
gotta have another shot.

23:53.467 --> 23:55.567
This is a fun
way to end it though, right?

23:55.600 --> 23:57.467
I love you.

23:57.500 --> 24:00.433
Uh... I love you, too.

24:00.467 --> 24:02.100
Colin, thank you.

24:02.133 --> 24:03.200
Thank you.

24:06.967 --> 24:10.000
That is some good scotch.

24:10.033 --> 24:12.333
Some Bancroft
moonshine right there.

24:12.367 --> 24:15.000
Uh, I should have held
in that pee.

24:22.300 --> 24:24.800
Alright guys...

24:24.834 --> 24:26.033
...ten minutes left.

24:26.066 --> 24:27.633
Oh my God.

24:27.667 --> 24:29.967
You’re watching
two legendary comedians

24:30.000 --> 24:32.000
from two different places.

24:32.033 --> 24:34.700
Colin is the improv master

24:34.734 --> 24:36.700
and then Tom Green is like

24:36.734 --> 24:38.600
the first word of
mouth celebrity

24:38.633 --> 24:40.867
in the history of the world.

24:40.900 --> 24:43.166
And watching
these two guys

24:43.200 --> 24:45.400
trying to crack each other...

24:45.433 --> 24:49.600
It is worth the price of
admission for that alone.

24:49.633 --> 24:51.000
You do impressions?

24:51.033 --> 24:52.400
- Oh!
- Have you done impressions?

24:52.433 --> 24:53.700
I only have this one.

24:53.734 --> 24:55.066
- Okay, wait, wait, wait, wait.
- Alright.

24:55.100 --> 24:56.433
Let me just mentally
prepare for this.

24:56.467 --> 24:57.667
- Right.
- Okay, wait.

24:57.700 --> 24:59.367
Ready?

24:59.400 --> 25:01.633
I...well...okay. Go.

25:01.667 --> 25:03.433
"Hi, I’m Craig T. Nelson."

25:07.300 --> 25:08.433
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

25:08.467 --> 25:09.734
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

25:09.767 --> 25:11.934
He almost laughed.

25:11.967 --> 25:16.934
I want to end this before
the time is out, obviously.

25:19.066 --> 25:20.600
So, I’m trying
to formulate through

25:20.633 --> 25:24.467
my already muddled brain
some way to attack.

25:24.500 --> 25:26.367
I also do this:

25:26.400 --> 25:30.266
"I’m Peter Graves.
Next on Biography"...

25:30.300 --> 25:31.533
Hmmm.

25:35.200 --> 25:37.734
Colin’s hitting a nerve here.

25:37.767 --> 25:39.633
I, I, I think,
I did Mr. Potter too.

25:39.667 --> 25:41.066
Mr. Potter?

25:41.100 --> 25:42.533
From, eh,
"It’s a Wonderful Life."

25:42.567 --> 25:44.600
Oh, yes.

25:44.633 --> 25:46.667
Lionel Barrymore was underrated.

25:46.700 --> 25:48.433
Wait a minute,
that’s not fair.

25:48.467 --> 25:50.367
Wooo.

25:50.400 --> 25:51.400
What happened?

25:51.433 --> 25:52.600
He just said Lionel Barrymore.

25:52.633 --> 25:54.266
Oh!

25:54.300 --> 25:56.967
Lionel Barrymore was one
of the famous Barrymore,

25:57.000 --> 25:58.967
um, family,

25:59.000 --> 26:01.000
and one of their relatives
of course

26:01.033 --> 26:03.600
is the lovely Drew Barrymore,
who Tom

26:03.633 --> 26:05.000
was married to at one point.

26:09.066 --> 26:10.934
You’re trying to pull
the emotional...

26:10.967 --> 26:15.200
"I know you think I’m a bitter
old man, George Bailey."

26:23.700 --> 26:25.433
Tom’s like, huh...

26:25.467 --> 26:27.100
Huh.

26:28.734 --> 26:29.667
And it was the first time
we’ve seen that from Tom

26:29.700 --> 26:32.900
basically the whole game.

26:32.934 --> 26:36.600
"I know exactly what you’re
doing, George Bailey."

26:38.000 --> 26:39.133
Finish him.

26:39.166 --> 26:40.100
Finish him. Take him down.

26:40.133 --> 26:41.100
Finish him.

26:41.133 --> 26:42.300
Off with his head.

26:42.333 --> 26:46.033
"You think I’m a bitter
old man George Bailey."

26:47.100 --> 26:48.467
He’s on the ropes.

26:50.100 --> 26:51.633
Oh God, oh God.

26:55.066 --> 26:59.700
"When I’m masturbating I think
about you with your poor..."

27:03.200 --> 27:06.700
Oh, he got him!
He got him!

27:10.967 --> 27:12.433
Oh!

27:14.367 --> 27:16.967
I’m so pissed, I could
not have done anymore.

27:19.500 --> 27:21.100
Oh!

27:21.133 --> 27:23.600
Really?
Lionel Barrymore got you?

27:23.633 --> 27:25.533
Ah. You know, it was
just funny, you know.

27:25.567 --> 27:27.934
He did an impression
of Lionel Barrymore

27:27.967 --> 27:29.934
and I think maybe the personal,

27:29.967 --> 27:33.133
sort of, nature of that
shifted me a little off guard.

27:33.166 --> 27:36.533
He just got me, man.
He just got me.

27:36.567 --> 27:38.100
God bless you, sir.

27:38.133 --> 27:39.400
- Yeah. I love you man.
- It was so much fun.

27:39.433 --> 27:41.033
- Yeah.
- It was so much fun.

27:41.066 --> 27:42.033
Absolutely.
Thank you, thank you.

27:42.066 --> 27:43.100
Thank you.

27:43.133 --> 27:45.667
Oh my God, Colin.

27:45.700 --> 27:48.033
He knew he was gonna
take us all down.

27:51.567 --> 27:54.033
Cheers, cheers, cheers.
That was fun.

27:55.467 --> 27:56.934
I’m letting it all out now,

27:56.967 --> 27:58.734
it’s been like six hours
of holding it all in.

27:58.767 --> 28:01.767
I know. I know.
Oh, it was so hard.

28:01.800 --> 28:04.000
Humping tables at 64-years-old
on national television.

28:04.033 --> 28:05.233
Yeah.

28:05.266 --> 28:07.100
You know what I,
I, I aspire to that.

28:08.800 --> 28:10.100
I just made you laugh.
That’s cool.

28:10.133 --> 28:11.066
It’s so easy to do.

28:11.100 --> 28:12.233
You know the game’s over
I know

28:12.266 --> 28:14.066
but I do appreciate
that I made you laugh.

28:15.600 --> 28:17.433
Here we go, come on!

28:20.367 --> 28:22.100
Hey!

28:22.133 --> 28:23.367
Oh!

28:23.400 --> 28:25.633
- Hey!
- Oh my God.

28:25.667 --> 28:28.266
You did it!

28:28.300 --> 28:29.967
You know, I, I, I...

28:30.000 --> 28:31.867
just felt good to know that
I made it to the end.

28:31.900 --> 28:34.800
I really enjoyed the showdown
with Colin and myself.

28:34.834 --> 28:38.133
I was happy that
that’s how it went down.

28:38.166 --> 28:39.633
Thank you. Thank you.

28:39.667 --> 28:41.333
Ladies and Gentleman,
the first winner!

28:41.367 --> 28:42.600
Oh jeez! Really?

28:42.633 --> 28:47.000
The inaugural champion
of LOL Canada!

28:48.100 --> 28:49.500
We present this to you.

28:49.533 --> 28:51.133
Thank you so much.

28:53.700 --> 28:55.633
Jesus Christ!

28:55.667 --> 28:58.000
What the hell!

28:58.033 --> 28:59.467
That was the scariest thing
that’s ever happened to me.

28:59.500 --> 29:02.033
You funny motherfucker.

29:02.066 --> 29:03.000
Oh. You bitch.

29:04.700 --> 29:06.467
Colin, can you tell us what
charity you’re playing for?

29:06.500 --> 29:08.633
I’m playing for the Welcome
Friend Association Rainbow Camp.

29:08.667 --> 29:11.533
It’s a camp for LGBTQ+ people.

29:11.567 --> 29:15.100
Giving them a safe place to have
a lovely summer experience.

29:15.133 --> 29:16.500
Yay!

29:16.533 --> 29:19.033
Alright, alright.

29:19.066 --> 29:23.133
Being with these people just
reminds you

29:23.166 --> 29:26.533
how incredible the Canadian
talent pool is.

29:26.567 --> 29:28.967
So go out there
and support your

29:29.000 --> 29:31.967
local comedy club
because we all

29:32.000 --> 29:33.066
need a laugh.

29:37.166 --> 29:40.767
Colin Mochrie, you are
The Last One Laughing.

30:07.133 --> 30:09.900
Caroline! Caroline!

30:09.934 --> 30:11.300
Wake up and go home!
