MARK: <i>JLB reunion. I've moved on.</i>

00:21.367 --> 00:23.927
<i>I'm serving nachos to arseholes.</i>

00:23.967 --> 00:26.242
<i>God, she's huge. It's like</i> Alien...

00:26.287 --> 00:27.686
<i>if the alien was a human.</i>

00:27.727 --> 00:31.436
<i>Hmm, if I had to choose, would I rather</i>
<i>an alien burst out of my chest quickly</i>

00:31.487 --> 00:34.957
<i>or was heaved out of my vagina slowly?</i>

00:35.007 --> 00:37.157
- All right, mate?
- Oh, hello, Jeff.

00:37.207 --> 00:38.959
I smelled burrito, thought it must be you.

00:39.007 --> 00:42.522
Yes, well, I've showered, actually,
but corn oil is persistent, so...

00:42.567 --> 00:43.841
Congratulations on the baby.

00:43.887 --> 00:45.479
<i>Yeah, congratulations on my millstone.</i>

00:45.527 --> 00:47.961
And now you know it's a boy, right?
Nice one.

00:48.007 --> 00:52.922
Right, yeah. What, you've seen the scan
and it has no penis, just like his father?

00:52.967 --> 00:55.686
No, Mark, for real. Sophie said.
Did she not tell you?

00:55.727 --> 00:56.876
Sophie?

00:56.927 --> 00:58.360
Aaah!

00:58.407 --> 01:00.875
Have I opened your Chrissie pressie early?

01:00.927 --> 01:05.762
Sophie, Jeff says the baby
is a boy-by. Is it a boy-by?

01:05.807 --> 01:08.082
I did call five times.
I left a message. Did you not?

01:08.127 --> 01:09.116
Obviously not.

01:09.167 --> 01:11.840
<i>Probably shouldn't switch the phone off</i>
<i>as soon as her name comes up.</i>

01:11.887 --> 01:13.240
Glad I could be the one to tell you.

01:13.287 --> 01:17.917
You'll always remember this moment now,
won't you? Me and you and Sophie...

01:17.967 --> 01:19.286
and the lad!

01:19.327 --> 01:21.158
<i>He's never going to be a lad.</i>

01:21.207 --> 01:24.324
<i>Boy to geek to drone,</i>
<i>that's the Corrigan trajectory.</i>

01:24.367 --> 01:28.883
Well, wow! A little male person.
Almost makes it seem real, doesn't it?

01:28.927 --> 01:31.725
- It is real.
- Yes, of course, I know.

01:31.767 --> 01:34.918
<i>Totally doesn't feel real.</i>
<i>Maybe about 1% realer now.</i>

01:34.967 --> 01:37.242
I was hoping to see you tonight
because I wanted to give you this.

01:37.287 --> 01:39.039
<i>Hate mail in person?</i>

01:39.087 --> 01:40.361
It's an early birthday present.

01:40.407 --> 01:43.205
Oh, that's very kind of you.
A month and a half early.

01:43.247 --> 01:44.521
It's, it's...

01:44.567 --> 01:46.319
tokens. Is it book tokens?

01:46.367 --> 01:48.164
It's vouchers... for driving lessons.

01:48.207 --> 01:51.165
An intensive driving course,
five hours a day, seven days,

01:51.207 --> 01:52.481
and then a test at the end.

01:52.527 --> 01:54.199
Oh, right. Wow.

01:54.247 --> 01:56.363
Cos you've always said how
you'd like to learn to drive, haven't you?

01:56.407 --> 01:57.362
Have I?

01:57.407 --> 01:58.920
Plus it will be really useful
once the baby arrives.

01:58.967 --> 02:04.325
Ah... right, of course.
That's really kind, Soph, thanks.

02:04.367 --> 02:07.279
<i>She's given herself a taxi driver</i>
<i>for my not yet birthday.</i>

02:07.327 --> 02:09.363
I've been thinking about names.
Have you?

02:09.407 --> 02:13.446
Oh, Sophie, it's early doors yet.
We've a month and some weeks to go.

02:13.487 --> 02:17.116
<i>I could get to Argentina in a month.</i>
<i>Argentina and a face transplant?</i>

02:17.167 --> 02:19.123
I was thinking Tarquin Oliver Nimrod.

02:22.207 --> 02:24.402
I... like it.

02:24.447 --> 02:26.517
- Why did you laugh?
- I thought it was a joke.

02:26.567 --> 02:27.920
You thought it was a joke but you like it?

02:27.967 --> 02:29.844
Tarquin Oliver Nimrod?

02:29.887 --> 02:32.037
Come on.
Give the little bugger a chance.

02:32.087 --> 02:34.681
What would you call him? Mark?
Mark Mark Corrigan the Third?

02:34.727 --> 02:37.480
No! Of course not. Just something normal.

02:37.527 --> 02:39.722
- What's normal?
- I don't know, Bruce or something.

02:39.767 --> 02:40.916
Bruce!?

02:40.967 --> 02:42.878
- No, not Bruce.
- You just said Bruce.

02:42.927 --> 02:45.077
I didn't mean Bruce.
Just a name in that area.

02:45.127 --> 02:47.846
- Little Bruce?
- No, not Bruce, just a name like Bruce.

02:47.887 --> 02:49.718
Not even that much like Bruce.

02:49.767 --> 02:53.123

<i>course, I'll earn some naming credits.</i>

03:12.767 --> 03:15.361
- Um...
- What?

03:15.407 --> 03:18.558
Oh. OK, if you like,
I can open the window.

03:18.607 --> 03:20.325
Right, what are you waiting for?

03:20.367 --> 03:23.359
- Shall I just... go?
- That's the general idea.

03:23.407 --> 03:27.400
(ENGINE STARTS)

03:27.447 --> 03:30.405
Oh! Fuck! My shoulder. Careful.

03:30.447 --> 03:31.357
Are you OK?

03:31.407 --> 03:35.161
It's dislocated, so it hurts when you
drive like a dick. What did you stall for?

03:35.207 --> 03:39.086
Because I can't drive.
That's why I'm having a driving lesson.

03:39.127 --> 03:41.436
All right, fine, go again,
easy on the clutch.

03:41.487 --> 03:43.921
<i>He hasn't even told me</i>
<i>which pedal is which.</i>

03:43.967 --> 03:47.277
<i>He's assuming</i>
<i>an incredible degree of knowledge.</i>

03:47.327 --> 03:48.999
Bloody hell, you are terrible.

03:49.047 --> 03:51.481
Look, I'm sorry, but I can't drive.

03:51.527 --> 03:53.836
Maybe in your career
as a driving instructor

03:53.887 --> 03:56.879
you may get one or two pupils
from failed states like Eritrea

03:56.927 --> 03:59.043
where they have
no licensing infrastructure

03:59.087 --> 04:01.157
but basically already know how to drive.

04:01.207 --> 04:04.324
However, I feel like I should warn you
that the vast majority

04:04.367 --> 04:07.200
are going to be people like me
who can't drive.

04:07.247 --> 04:10.080
- All right, keep your wig on.
- <i>That's a retro put-down.</i>

04:10.127 --> 04:12.118

<i>No more lessons. The machines have won.</i>

04:27.967 --> 04:30.003
I know. Wow!

04:30.047 --> 04:31.719
That was pretty good work.

04:31.767 --> 04:33.485
We were really going at it.

04:33.527 --> 04:38.157
I just wish that, without doing a porno,
there was some way for us to make

04:38.207 --> 04:41.165
financial profit out of how good we are
at doing it to each other.

04:41.207 --> 04:44.244
It's amazing -
this whole nightmare.

04:44.287 --> 04:48.519
I love you and you love me
and Gail loves me.

04:48.567 --> 04:50.683
Shit, everyone loves me!

04:50.727 --> 04:51.876
And you love me.

04:51.927 --> 04:53.645
I'm more in love with you
than I've ever been.

04:53.687 --> 04:54.722
That is so great.

than I've ever been.

04:57.447 --> 04:58.721
Mm-hm.

04:58.767 --> 05:03.238
The only downer is,
and I know you've explained why it won't,

05:03.287 --> 05:08.566
but it almost feels
as if it might affect our relationship...

05:08.607 --> 05:10.245
you marrying someone else.

05:10.287 --> 05:11.322
Do you think?

05:11.367 --> 05:13.358
I mean, it's going to be horrible for me

05:13.407 --> 05:15.841
seeing you two
tie the civil partnership knot.

05:15.887 --> 05:17.286
Right.

05:17.327 --> 05:22.162
Because, obviously, you're
actually not going to be there, so...

05:22.207 --> 05:23.401
No?

05:23.447 --> 05:25.039
Well, too weird, Jez.

05:25.087 --> 05:26.122
Right.

05:26.167 --> 05:27.885
Hmm, I guess it is a shame.

05:27.927 --> 05:30.202
Cos with the whole Quebec thing,

05:30.247 --> 05:34.320
we're probably not going to see
each other, like, hardly any more times.

05:34.367 --> 05:35.641
<i>Quebec?</i>

05:35.687 --> 05:37.723
I did mention the whole Quebec thing?

05:37.767 --> 05:39.917
Er, no.

05:39.967 --> 05:44.483
We're going to house at Gail's sister's
place in Quebec for a few months.

05:44.527 --> 05:46.483
I definitely mentioned that, didn't I?

05:46.527 --> 05:49.644
I think I would have remembered
if you'd told me

05:49.687 --> 05:51.917
that you're leaving me to go to Quebec.

05:51.967 --> 05:54.435
Well, if you say so.

05:54.487 --> 05:55.806
But I think I did.

05:55.847 --> 06:00.363
Look, we're doing a couple of pre-wedding
parties for our London friends -

06:00.407 --> 06:01.920
a picnic and then the pub.

06:01.967 --> 06:03.446
Why don't you tag along?

06:03.487 --> 06:06.365
What? Like one of the group?
Like one of your fans?

06:06.407 --> 06:09.604
Forget the picnic. Why don't I just
subscribe to updates on your blog?

06:09.647 --> 06:12.320
Well, if you like.
I just thought it might be nice.

06:12.367 --> 06:16.280
I was joking. I'm definitely,
definitely, definitely coming.

06:16.327 --> 06:18.966
<i>She can't leave me for Quebec.</i>
<i>I'll steal her passport.</i>

<i>I could write a play</i>

<i>unrecognised in his own time.</i>

<i>or maybe even hates, chips.</i>

06:52.207 --> 06:54.960
<i>Gail and Elena's London friends.</i>
<i>Thin gruel.</i>

06:55.007 --> 06:58.079
<i>They must be half hating themselves</i>
<i>for having to invite me,</i>

06:58.127 --> 07:00.243
<i>and half despising me for turning up.</i>

07:00.287 --> 07:03.757
So everything's coming together for the
wedding and the big trip. It's exciting.

07:03.807 --> 07:05.638
Yeah, it is exciting.

07:05.687 --> 07:09.521
<i>Yeah, I guess it was pretty exciting</i>
<i>when they assassinated JFK,</i>

07:09.567 --> 07:11.876
<i>unless you happened to love JFK's brain.</i>

07:11.927 --> 07:13.485
Hey, you know what I fancy?

07:13.527 --> 07:15.085
A row on the lake.

07:15.127 --> 07:17.243
Elena?
Anyone fancy a row on the lake?

07:17.287 --> 07:19.437
- Elena?
- Er, I don't know, Jeremy.

07:19.487 --> 07:20.761
Come on, it'll be fun.

07:21.767 --> 07:23.678
- How was the interview?
- I'm sorry?

07:23.727 --> 07:26.116
The job interview that meant
you couldn't come to the antenatal class.

07:26.167 --> 07:27.725
Oh, er, right, yeah.

07:27.767 --> 07:29.803
Good. Pretty good.
Fingers crossed.

07:29.847 --> 07:30.836
<i>Not a total lie.</i>

07:30.887 --> 07:32.240
<i>There was an interview.</i>

07:32.287 --> 07:34.642
<i>I was interviewing myself</i>
<i>for a job as a playwright,</i>

07:34.687 --> 07:36.200
<i>and by Jove, I think I got itl</i>

07:36.247 --> 07:38.363
How was the class? Pretty gruesome?

07:38.407 --> 07:40.125
Good, actually. In the end Jeff came down.

07:40.167 --> 07:44.638
Jeff? Wha? Why? To perv
at pictures of ladies breast-feeding?

07:44.687 --> 07:47.247
Because I asked him.
I felt weird going on my own.

07:47.287 --> 07:48.686
<i>Fine. Let him get on with it.</i>

07:48.727 --> 07:52.720
<i>I'll be fine with my high-fat foods, which</i>
<i>will eventually kill me, and my play,</i>

07:52.767 --> 07:54.997
<i>which is obviously never going to happen.</i>

07:55.047 --> 07:57.277
We actually came up with
a new name I really like.

07:57.327 --> 07:59.204
Oh, yeah?
<i>What fresh hell?</i>

07:59.247 --> 08:00.999
<i>Spock? Mao? Vandross?</i>

08:01.047 --> 08:03.402
Yeah, I'm pretty set on Geoffrey.

08:03.447 --> 08:06.166
Jeff? As in Jeff, after Jeff?

08:06.207 --> 08:08.402
Oh, yeah.
I hadn't actually thought about that.

08:08.447 --> 08:11.917
No, it'll be Geoffrey with a G,
not a J, after my Uncle Geoff.

08:11.967 --> 08:13.923
<i>Oh, God, I've created a father vacuum</i>

08:13.967 --> 08:17.562

<i>to fill it like some toxic gas.</i>

<i>I want my baby backl</i>

08:18.767 --> 08:21.759
I'd leave the naming to the baby-mama
if I were you. That's what I did.

08:21.807 --> 08:23.240
You have... kids?

08:23.287 --> 08:24.436
The twins.

08:24.487 --> 08:26.796
I'm always going on
about me twins, aren't I?

08:26.847 --> 08:29.407
I don't think you've ever
previously mentioned the twins.

08:29.447 --> 08:32.484
Course I have.
The twins. The fucking twins.

08:32.527 --> 08:35.644
I'm always on about 'em.
I bloody love them two.

08:35.687 --> 08:38.520
- Here, I've got them on me phone.
- (BEEPING)

08:38.567 --> 08:40.159
Hold on. Have I?

08:40.207 --> 08:43.756
Oh, I'll never forgive Orange
if they've wiped the twins.

08:43.807 --> 08:47.800
Oh, that is... that is shitty!
Where are the bloody twins?

08:47.847 --> 08:49.326
Great kids.

08:50.247 --> 08:51.362
A bit lazy.

08:51.407 --> 08:52.522
A bit on the lazy side.

08:52.567 --> 08:54.956
Very rarely pick up the phone
to their old man.

08:55.007 --> 08:57.601
- How old are they?
- How old? Oh...

08:57.647 --> 08:58.762
Seven or eight.

08:58.807 --> 09:00.160
What's fünf in English?

09:00.207 --> 09:04.723
- Five.
- They turned fünf zwei years ago.

09:04.767 --> 09:08.157
So... what? A pair of eighters, I reckon.

09:08.207 --> 09:10.084

09:19.527 --> 09:23.202
Come on, get in. We can go for a row.
We can have secret rowing-boat sex.

09:23.247 --> 09:27.001
I don't know, Jez. This is too weird.
You're being really intense.

09:27.047 --> 09:30.926
Oh, come on, please. This could be the
last time we're alone together... ever.

09:30.967 --> 09:34.277
I can't believe
you're just getting married and going.

09:34.327 --> 09:37.125
- I know. It's weird, isn't it?
- Yes. Weird.

09:37.167 --> 09:40.443
That's exactly the word
I was looking for. It's so weird.

09:40.487 --> 09:44.241
Weird, like, "Come over here and drop
your nuts into this deep-fat fryer."

09:44.287 --> 09:48.166
"Oh, OK. Ooh, that's a bit weird.
What a weird sensation. How weird."

09:48.207 --> 09:49.845
I'm losing my fucking mind here.

09:49.887 --> 09:52.196
I'm sorry, Jez. I didn't expect it,

09:52.247 --> 09:55.239
but it turns out that
getting married is really romantic.

09:56.247 --> 09:57.236
Room for one more?

09:57.287 --> 10:00.643
Er, no. Not really. No.

10:00.687 --> 10:03.520
You know what?
Why don't you two go without me?

10:03.567 --> 10:05.046
Because I'm not sure I fancy it.

10:05.087 --> 10:08.045
OK. I love messing about on boats.

10:08.087 --> 10:10.282
Um, actually, you know what?

10:10.327 --> 10:15.117
There is room, room for all of us, in
the bow, or the stern, or the quarterdeck.

10:15.167 --> 10:16.282
Chocks away!

10:16.327 --> 10:20.479
<i>That's planes,</i>
<i>you utter, utter, terrible, stupid dick.</i>

10:20.527 --> 10:24.998
Look, Soph, I just wanted to tell you
that I was going to step up with the baby.

10:25.047 --> 10:26.685
I'm going to do the right thing.

10:26.727 --> 10:28.206
Great. That's great.

10:28.247 --> 10:33.082
The truth is, I'm scared about the baby.
I'm fucking terrified.

10:33.127 --> 10:35.118
I can't sleep and I've got mouth ulcers

10:35.167 --> 10:37.727
and that weird stress thing
I get with my elbows.

10:37.767 --> 10:40.964
And my bowels... Well, you know how,
normally, I'm like clockwork?

10:41.007 --> 10:43.441
- Uh-huh.
- Well, right now, I'm all over the shop.

10:43.487 --> 10:46.684
But the headline is that I'm doing this,

10:46.727 --> 10:49.366
I'm driving you in
and I'm wheeling you out.

10:49.407 --> 10:50.681
That's great, Mark.

10:50.727 --> 10:53.958
Cos the driving, I know it seems
like a little thing, but to me,

10:54.007 --> 10:58.046
it feels big, you know? Cos I don't want
to go in with my dad or Jeff or someone.

10:58.087 --> 11:00.521
So do you reckon you'll pass
this afternoon?

11:00.567 --> 11:02.637
Oh, yeah.
<i>Only took one lesson</i>

11:02.687 --> 11:04.166
<i>and had to pay to get the clutch repaired.</i>

11:04.207 --> 11:07.279
I mean, nothing's guaranteed.
Not in this world.

11:07.327 --> 11:10.205
Well, it's like a 97% pass rate
if you did all the lessons.

11:10.247 --> 11:13.637
Of course I did all the lessons.
What else would I have been doing?

11:13.687 --> 11:17.236
Watching the frankly overrated
<i>The Wire</i> on DVD day after day?

11:17.287 --> 11:19.960
<i>Right, gotta try.</i>
<i>There's always the slim chance</i>

11:20.007 --> 11:24.444
<i>the examiner will pass me because he's gay</i>
<i>and inexplicably finds me super hot.</i>

11:24.487 --> 11:27.240
It's great to spend
some proper time with you, Jeremy.

11:27.287 --> 11:29.847
When I first met you,
I thought you were a bit of a loser.

11:29.887 --> 11:31.718
Oh, really?

11:31.767 --> 11:33.883
Now I think you're, you know, all right.

11:33.927 --> 11:35.519
Well, that's great.

11:35.567 --> 11:38.798
You probably don't know this, but Elena
and I have had our ups and downs.

11:38.847 --> 11:42.044
It's amazing to think we're going
to spend the rest of our lives together.

11:42.087 --> 11:45.079
<i>What can I do? Make a pass at her?</i>
<i>She won't be interested,</i>

11:45.127 --> 11:48.403
<i>but it might put a spanner in the works</i>
<i>in some way no-one can predict.</i>

11:48.447 --> 11:50.278
I'm not much of a sailor.
I can't actually swim.

11:50.327 --> 11:51.806
Really?

11:51.847 --> 11:55.396
<i>God, it'd be so great if she just</i>
<i>fell in the water, a few big bubbles,</i>

11:55.447 --> 11:57.961
<i>and then a few smaller ones,</i>
<i>and then pfffff...</i>

11:58.007 --> 11:59.645
<i>problem gone.</i>

11:59.687 --> 12:02.121
- <i>She definitely said she can't swim.</i>
...our relationship.

12:02.167 --> 12:03.998
<i>I definitely couldn't push her in.</i>

12:04.047 --> 12:06.561
<i>It'd be so much easier</i>
<i>if she wasn't a human being</i>

12:06.607 --> 12:09.326
<i>with hopes and dreams</i>
<i>and clinging, grasping arms.</i>

12:09.367 --> 12:10.720
Is it cool to swap over again?

12:10.767 --> 12:12.041
Yeah, OK.

12:13.207 --> 12:14.765
Ooh, a bit wobbly.

12:14.807 --> 12:15.922
Wobbly!

12:17.007 --> 12:19.919
Oh, shit! Oh, shit! Oh, shit!

12:19.967 --> 12:23.437
<i>Oh, no, this is terriblel</i>
<i>I thought she said she couldn't swim.</i>

12:25.007 --> 12:30.001
<i>OK, here we go. What's my plan here?</i>
<i>Touch him up? Let him touch me up?</i>

12:30.047 --> 12:33.164
<i>Would either of us enjoy</i>
<i>touching the other one up at all?</i>

12:33.207 --> 12:34.686
<i>No, gotta be something else.</i>

12:34.727 --> 12:38.606
<i>Some point of contact.</i>
<i>He's a Spurs fan. A Spurrer?</i>

12:38.647 --> 12:41.525
<i>Could go a bit spurry?</i>
<i>Spur things up?</i>

12:41.567 --> 12:45.879
Ooh, my knees are killing me. They
don't give you much room for manoeuvre,

12:45.927 --> 12:48.487
those seats down at the White Hart ground,

12:48.527 --> 12:50.119
do they?
<i>Pretty sure that's right.</i>

12:50.167 --> 12:53.045
Right, if you'd like
to start the vehicle and drive off,

12:53.087 --> 12:55.203
and we'll join the traffic to our left.

12:55.247 --> 12:58.080
Er... OK, here's the thing.

12:58.127 --> 12:59.845
I can't actually drive.

12:59.887 --> 13:04.881
However, for personal reasons, I really,
really need to get a driving licence,

13:04.927 --> 13:08.363
so I was just wondering
whether there was any chance at all

13:08.407 --> 13:11.080
that you could pass me
without taking the test,

13:11.127 --> 13:14.164
and then I promise
that I'll take the lessons very soon

13:14.207 --> 13:16.163
and become a competent driver.

13:16.207 --> 13:17.845
I totally promise.

13:17.887 --> 13:22.005
<i>And maybe he'll grant me a Nobel prize</i>
<i>if I promise to nail cold fusion.</i>

13:23.567 --> 13:25.398
Tomorrow's the big day.

13:25.447 --> 13:29.884
Gail gets to marry me
and my wheat intolerance.

13:29.927 --> 13:32.839
<i>Of course she has a wheat intolerance</i> -
<i>she's far too important</i>

13:32.887 --> 13:34.525
<i>to be able to tolerate wheat.</i>

13:34.567 --> 13:39.561
And finally, I'd like to give
a big shout out to the hero of the hour,

13:39.607 --> 13:40.676
the life-saver,

13:40.727 --> 13:44.083
Mr Jeremy Usbourne.

13:45.247 --> 13:47.920
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, fine. Good.

13:47.967 --> 13:51.562
Listen, Jez, we'd really love it
if you could come down to the wedding.

13:51.607 --> 13:53.962
We've shuffled it around.
Sophie's going next door to us.

13:54.007 --> 13:57.556
There's a spare cottage if you fancy it...
my saviour.

13:57.607 --> 14:01.202
<i>Stop going on about itl</i>
Oh, well, er, cheers.

14:03.367 --> 14:04.516
What?

14:04.567 --> 14:07.365
You seem to be acting
with almost genuine modesty and humility.

14:08.567 --> 14:10.478
I tried to kill her, Mark.

14:10.527 --> 14:13.724
- I think I tried to bloody drown her.
- What?

14:13.767 --> 14:15.120
But you rescued her.

14:15.167 --> 14:17.681
Why would you rescue her
if you wanted to kill her?

14:17.727 --> 14:19.604
I was thinking, "I want her to fall in,"

14:19.647 --> 14:21.956
- and she did fall in.
- So?

14:22.007 --> 14:25.044
I wanted interest rates to fall
to historic lows and they did.

14:25.087 --> 14:27.123
That doesn't make me
the Governor of the Bank of England.

14:27.167 --> 14:30.204
Who knows what I'm capable of? I could
kill anyone in this room with a pencil.

14:30.247 --> 14:31.646
You really couldn't.

14:31.687 --> 14:35.282
- God... I'm evil!
- No, Jez.

14:35.327 --> 14:37.841
The absolute worst thing
anyone could say about you

14:37.887 --> 14:40.720
is that you were a selfish moral blank

14:40.767 --> 14:44.123
whose lazy cynicism
and sneering, ironic take on the world

14:44.167 --> 14:46.886
encapsulates everything wrong
with a generation.

14:46.927 --> 14:50.044
But you, my friend, are not evil.

14:51.047 --> 14:52.400
Thanks, man.

14:53.847 --> 14:55.200
<i>Shit.</i>
Hey, there.

14:55.247 --> 14:56.726
Hi, Mark, how'd the driving test go?

14:56.767 --> 15:00.157
Oh, <i>well... He didn't report me</i>
<i>for attempted bribery, so pretty well.</i>

15:00.207 --> 15:03.802
Don't worry, mate, you can always
take Soph to the hospital on your bike.

15:03.847 --> 15:05.166
Give her a seatie.

15:05.207 --> 15:07.880
<i>Get off my patch, Jeff.</i>
<i>Take your flag out of my baby.</i>

15:07.927 --> 15:10.361
No, it is tough.
I mean, I didn't pass till...

15:10.407 --> 15:13.240
Actually, come to think of it,
I passed first time.

15:13.287 --> 15:16.324
Just try to remember
not to get into double figures.

15:16.367 --> 15:19.086
Well, no need, actually, because I passed.

15:19.127 --> 15:21.595
- Oh, wow!
- Yes, with flying colours.

15:21.647 --> 15:25.322
It was quite funny, actually, because
he said, "You passed with flying colours."

15:25.367 --> 15:27.597
And I was like,
"What does that phrase even mean?"

15:27.647 --> 15:30.081
And he laughed and said,
"Well, with a test score like that,

15:30.127 --> 15:33.597
"I would have thought you should know,"
and then we both laughed.

15:33.647 --> 15:36.480
<i>Better put a stop</i>
<i>to this imaginary interchange soon.</i>

15:36.527 --> 15:37.516
Yeah, it was great.

15:37.567 --> 15:39.842
Oh, well done, Mark. Congratulations.

15:39.887 --> 15:42.447
Thanks, I'm really pleased.

15:42.487 --> 15:45.206
<i>Month to retake my test.</i>
<i>Can't be that hard.</i>

15:45.247 --> 15:48.080
<i>Mum drives, the Hamster drives,</i>
<i>Jez drives.</i>

15:48.127 --> 15:51.039
Gail said you're coming down to Hampshire
for the wedding. See you there.

15:51.087 --> 15:53.681
Yeah. Listen, Soph,
can I have a quick word?

15:53.727 --> 15:55.638
Sure. Let's drive over here.

15:55.687 --> 15:57.518
BOTH: Brrrrrrrrrr!

15:57.567 --> 15:59.683
<i>She is a bit adorable, bit annoying.</i>

15:59.727 --> 16:02.560
- (THEY IMITATE BRAKES)
- <i>Right on the cusp.</i>

16:02.607 --> 16:04.279
So, on the name thing, Soph,

16:04.327 --> 16:08.206
I'd be basically happy for the baby
to be called anything you like.

16:08.247 --> 16:10.238
But... Geoff?

16:10.287 --> 16:13.757
Yeah, I hadn't thought about the
Geoff/Jeff thing. Might be a bit weird.

16:13.807 --> 16:16.162
You're doing your bit with the driving,
maybe I can do mine.

16:16.207 --> 16:18.198
Great, Soph. Great.

16:18.247 --> 16:22.718
<i>Screw you, dick-wadl He's my baby.</i>
<i>Get your own baby off the internet,</i>

16:22.767 --> 16:25.804
<i>or by impregnating a woman</i>
<i>with your penis, just like I didl</i>

16:27.007 --> 16:29.396
<i>Gail and Elena's big day.</i>

16:29.447 --> 16:33.201
<i>It's meant to be 30 degrees today.</i>
<i>I'm going to boil in that morning suit.</i>

16:33.247 --> 16:35.363
<i>Oh, it's great being a wedding guest(l)</i>

16:35.407 --> 16:39.559
<i>You get to be an unpaid extra in the</i>
<i>climactic scene of someone else's romcom.</i>

16:39.607 --> 16:42.804
Jeremy, what are you doing?
It's six in the bloody morning.

16:42.847 --> 16:45.407
I'm thinking about Elena
and watching <i>Jaws.</i>

16:45.447 --> 16:49.326
Oh, God! Have you even been to bed? Don't
you think you've had enough to drink?

16:49.367 --> 16:51.801
Um, that's a thoughtful question.

16:51.847 --> 16:53.360
Er... no.

16:53.407 --> 16:56.558
As it happens,
I don't think I've had enough to drink.

16:56.607 --> 16:59.644
I'm going to carry on drinking
until they catch Jaws the shark.

16:59.687 --> 17:03.043
The shark isn't called Jaws, Jeremy,
the film is called <i>Jaws.</i>

17:03.087 --> 17:06.124
Of course the shark's called Jaws.
"Here comes Jaws. Jaws the shark.

17:06.166 --> 17:08.476
"Mind he doesn't bite you
with his enormous jaws."

17:08.527 --> 17:10.563
Anyway, thank you very much -
your phone woke me up.

17:10.607 --> 17:13.280
You know what I get like
if I don't get my full 8¾ hours.

17:13.327 --> 17:15.124
Oh, my life, it's a text from Elena!

17:15.166 --> 17:18.239
"Thinking of you."
She's thinking of me, Mark.

17:18.287 --> 17:21.279
Or at least she was six hours ago.
With three kisses.

17:21.327 --> 17:23.840
Oh, my God, this is massive!
I'm going over there.

17:23.887 --> 17:28.403
Don't be ridiculous. If text kisses were
real kisses, the world would be an orgy.

17:28.446 --> 17:31.757
No, it's the day of her wedding.
What are you going to do?

17:31.807 --> 17:34.719
I don't know. Who knows what I'm capable
of? I mean, I proved that on the lake.

17:34.767 --> 17:36.678
<i>The untalented Mr Ripley.</i>

17:36.727 --> 17:38.604
- Where's the car keys?
- You're way over the limit.

17:38.647 --> 17:40.524
- Give me the car keys, Mark.
- No.

17:40.567 --> 17:42.046
All right, let's get you driving.
I'm teaching.

17:42.087 --> 17:45.921
I hate to be negative, but you drunk
off your noggin, me in my pyjamas -

17:45.967 --> 17:49.846
it doesn't feel like the ideal time
for me to restart my driving career.

17:49.887 --> 17:52.401
Hello, I need your best driver
and your fastest car.

17:52.447 --> 17:56.201
No, two hours is no good.
I need someone immediately.

17:56.247 --> 17:58.966
OK, well, how about
you get off your great fat anus

17:59.007 --> 18:02.363
and come and drive me yourself,
you self-important hick?

18:02.407 --> 18:03.886
Hello?

18:03.927 --> 18:06.157
Hello? I retract that last comment.

18:06.207 --> 18:08.163
- Hello?
- (MOBILE RINGS)

18:08.207 --> 18:10.516
- Hello?
- SOPHIE: <i>Hi, Mark?</i>

18:10.567 --> 18:12.125
- Sophie?
- <i>Look, I'm sorry to call like this,</i>

18:12.167 --> 18:14.362
<i>but I think I might be going into labour.</i>

18:14.407 --> 18:18.366
Oh, my God! Oh, my God, it's early.
You're never early!

18:18.407 --> 18:20.204
You're always late - always.

18:20.247 --> 18:21.999
- For everything!
- <i>It's all right, Mark.</i>

18:22.047 --> 18:23.765
- <i>Relax.</i>
- Oh, God!

18:23.807 --> 18:25.445
Oh, shit! Oh, God!

18:25.487 --> 18:29.002
<i>I'm with Elena and Gail, but their car</i>
<i>won't start and we can't get a taxi.</i>

18:29.047 --> 18:30.605
Right. No, shit.

18:30.647 --> 18:34.162
<i>Gail's gone to find a mechanic, but I need</i>
<i>to get to the hospital right away.</i>

18:34.207 --> 18:37.279
- <i>So would you mind?</i>
- Isn't there anyone else you could ask?

18:37.327 --> 18:39.124
<i>Mark, I need to get to the hospital, nowl</i>

18:39.167 --> 18:40.566
Um...

18:40.607 --> 18:43.724
Sophie's at Elena's cottage.
She's having the bloody baby!

18:43.767 --> 18:47.077
Well, let's go. Let's do it, man.
Here come the cavalry.

18:48.367 --> 18:51.325
I'm coming over, Soph. I am coming over.

18:52.327 --> 18:54.522
This is perfect. Gail's out, I'm in.

18:54.567 --> 18:58.845
Try and focus. I'm going to need a lot,
and I mean a hell of a lot, of help.

18:58.887 --> 19:01.355
You'll be fine, Mark. Just drive.

19:02.647 --> 19:04.922
(ENGINE STARTS)

19:06.407 --> 19:07.806
Except not like a dick.

19:07.847 --> 19:10.998
"Not like a dick"?
That's your driving instruction?

19:11.047 --> 19:13.607
Please, Jeremy,
I need you to guide, to advise.

19:13.647 --> 19:15.603
I don't even know about road signs.

19:15.647 --> 19:17.126
- What does that one mean?
- I don't know.

19:17.167 --> 19:18.725
Nobody knows. It doesn't matter.

19:18.767 --> 19:21.600
It's lost knowledge, like...
how the aliens did the pyramids.

19:21.647 --> 19:25.003
Slaves did the pyramids, Jeremy.
Thousands and thousands of slaves.

19:25.047 --> 19:27.163
God, you're depressing.

19:27.207 --> 19:29.926
- <i>Don't blame me</i> - <i>blame Ramses II.</i>
- Shit!

19:29.967 --> 19:32.401
- (CAR HORN BLARES)
- Oh, fuck off!

19:32.447 --> 19:34.085
It's not his fault he's a dick.

19:34.127 --> 19:36.436
He's doing his fucking best, isn't he?
Screw you!

19:36.487 --> 19:40.400
Right, step on it.
This could be my last ever sex window.

19:40.447 --> 19:43.644
<i>Great(l) I'm the fifth emergency service.</i>
<i>The sex ambulance.</i>

19:45.247 --> 19:47.283
There, you see? You can do it.

19:47.327 --> 19:50.797
Very, very slowly, 30 to 40 stalls,
one major steering error,

19:50.847 --> 19:55.238
a bit of me on clutch at the crossroads
when the man beeped, but you <i>can</i> do it.

19:55.287 --> 19:59.075
Right, I'm just going to nip in there,
persuade her not to get married,

19:59.127 --> 20:02.005
convince her that I'm the guy for her,
quick bit of how's-your-father,

20:02.047 --> 20:04.686
not murder anyone, back in five,
off to the hospital.

20:04.727 --> 20:06.319
- Cushty.
- No, Jez!

20:06.367 --> 20:09.040
Absolutely not! No, stay.
You've got to help me.

20:10.447 --> 20:11.721
(HOOTING)

20:11.767 --> 20:13.723
All right, Soph? Have a good one.

20:13.767 --> 20:14.756
Hi.

20:14.807 --> 20:15.842
<i>Oh, Godl</i>

20:15.887 --> 20:17.923
<i>Oh, God, oh, God, oh, Godl</i>

20:17.967 --> 20:21.437
- How are you doing, Soph?
- I think I'm having a baby. OK, let's go.

20:21.487 --> 20:26.356
Er, yeah, right. OK.
But should we just quickly wait for Jez?

20:26.407 --> 20:28.363
I'm about to have a baby. We need to go!

20:28.407 --> 20:33.037
Yeah, but Jez will be really, really
pissed off if he misses it. He's excited.

20:33.087 --> 20:36.159
I don't even want Jeremy to be there,
Mark. Let's go.

20:36.207 --> 20:38.767
Right. Yeah? Really?

20:38.807 --> 20:42.595
<i>Hmm, kill my unborn child</i>
<i>in a road traffic accident to save face?</i>

20:42.647 --> 20:45.445
- <i>Doesn't feel great.</i>
- Oh, here comes another one.

20:45.487 --> 20:47.045
(GROANING)

20:47.087 --> 20:51.319
<i>OK, got to tell her, got to come clean,</i>
<i>take the humiliation.</i>

20:51.367 --> 20:54.757
- OK, OK, go, go. Go, go, go!
- What?

20:54.807 --> 20:58.561
Gail, she's coming back, down the road.
We need to get out of here. Go, go, go.

20:58.607 --> 21:00.484
- Pedal to the metal.
- No need to shout.

21:00.527 --> 21:02.040
You've fucking stalled!

21:02.087 --> 21:04.601
Shouting will not make me
a better driver, Jeremy.

21:04.647 --> 21:07.764
Fucking go! If Gail sees me here,
everything's finished. Just go!

21:07.807 --> 21:09.957
- They're having an affair.
- Oh, right.

21:10.007 --> 21:12.316
- It's complicated.
- Go, go, fucking go!

21:12.367 --> 21:13.641
(ENGINE STALLS)

21:13.687 --> 21:16.201
There, you see, I've stalled again.
And do you know why?

21:16.247 --> 21:18.841
It's because I'm nervous. And I'm nervous
because you're shouting at me.

21:18.887 --> 21:20.639
OK. And relax.

21:20.687 --> 21:24.999
And engage fucking reverse gear and <i>gol</i>

21:25.047 --> 21:30.405
I'm not going. Why is it not going?
Why isn't it going?

21:30.447 --> 21:32.244
You've got the hand brake on, you cock!

21:32.287 --> 21:33.197
Are you OK, Mark?

21:33.247 --> 21:35.477
Normally, I wouldn't make
such a basic error,

21:35.527 --> 21:38.325
but as you can see,
this is quite a stressful situation.

21:38.367 --> 21:39.516
Move it, you arsehole!

21:39.567 --> 21:43.082
Shit, I can't find the biting point.
Where's the biting point?

21:43.127 --> 21:44.719
Why are you indicating?

21:44.767 --> 21:46.644
Don't indicate, fucking go!

21:46.687 --> 21:49.360
I need to alert other road users
to my intentions.

21:49.407 --> 21:50.601
That's it. Come on!

21:51.647 --> 21:53.797
OK. Mirror, signal, manoeuvre.
Mirror, signal...

21:53.847 --> 21:56.839
- Come on, get out. You can't drive.
- Of course I can drive.

21:57.607 --> 21:59.438
Out!

22:00.527 --> 22:02.643
No wonder you failed your test, you div.

22:02.687 --> 22:05.281
No, look, no! Jeremy, wait! You're drunk!

22:05.327 --> 22:06.601
Wait!

22:08.047 --> 22:11.164
<i>If anyone should crash</i>
<i>and kill my child, it should be me.</i>

22:11.207 --> 22:13.516
- Come on, Soph.
- Jeremy, it's Gail.

22:13.567 --> 22:15.523
- Oh, fuck!
- SOPHIE: Argh!

22:17.447 --> 22:21.156
<i>Oh, shitl Probably have to re-tell</i>
<i>this moment in crown court,</i>

22:21.207 --> 22:23.960
<i>and I've already forgotten</i>
<i>exactly what happened.</i>

22:24.007 --> 22:26.965
- Oh, my God!
- What happened?

22:27.007 --> 22:30.238
- I did it again, Mark. I did it again.
- What?

22:30.287 --> 22:34.075
You didn't pass? You were going
to drive me and you can't drive?!

22:34.127 --> 22:36.436
I tried to kill her. I went for her.

22:36.487 --> 22:39.081
I can't believe you, Mark. I can't!

22:39.127 --> 22:40.765
What are you all doing here?

22:40.807 --> 22:43.401
I'm having an affair.
We're having an affair.

22:43.447 --> 22:46.996
We've been doing it behind your back
and now it's all come out

22:47.047 --> 22:49.197
because I keep on trying to kill you.

22:49.247 --> 22:51.807
Oh, Jesus!

22:52.807 --> 22:55.446
Thank you very much, Jeremy(!)

22:55.487 --> 22:57.637
Er, I really need
to get to the hospital, Elena.

22:57.687 --> 23:00.520
I'm sorry, but we really need to talk.

23:00.567 --> 23:03.923
It's a biggie for me, Soph.
It's kind of urgent.

23:03.967 --> 23:08.563
- For fuck's sake!
- Soph, you can't drive yourself!

23:08.607 --> 23:10.040
Yeah, well, I think I'll be safer

23:10.087 --> 23:12.521
than with the pissed murderer
or the unlicensed liar.

23:12.567 --> 23:14.319
Jeremy, we can't leave her.

23:14.367 --> 23:16.801
She's not safe.
We've got to go with her.

23:18.687 --> 23:22.123
So... OK, Soph, here we are
going to the hospital with you.

23:22.167 --> 23:26.399
I'm right behind you, so if you need
directions or tissues or anything,

23:26.447 --> 23:28.165
don't hesitate to let me know.

23:28.207 --> 23:32.166
<i>Yeah, tissues and directions, good.</i>
<i>Don't have any tissues,</i>

23:32.207 --> 23:34.721
<i>don't know where we're going, so...</i>
<i>got those covered.</i>
