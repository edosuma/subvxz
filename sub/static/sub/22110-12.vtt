Send in Stewie, please.

00:40.790 --> 00:42.126
Oh, I can go in now?

00:42.159 --> 00:43.127
Oh, fantastic.

00:43.160 --> 00:45.028
He's ready. Marvelous.

00:45.061 --> 00:46.062
Thank you, Barbara.

00:46.096 --> 00:47.364
I hope you get
those Adele tickets.

00:47.397 --> 00:48.765
You deserve them.

00:48.798 --> 00:50.100
She won't get them. No way.

00:50.134 --> 00:51.868
She needed to get them,
like, a month ago.

00:51.901 --> 00:53.703
So, um, is that me over there?

00:53.737 --> 00:54.704
If you like.

00:54.738 --> 00:56.506
Here we go.

01:00.744 --> 01:02.979
I saw the kid
who has cancer leave.

01:03.012 --> 01:04.548
That must've been fun.

01:04.581 --> 01:07.217
I don't know why his parents are
still bringing him to school.

01:07.251 --> 01:08.885
It's uncomfortable for everyone.

01:08.918 --> 01:11.921
I've never seen him
when he's not just thrown up.

01:13.323 --> 01:15.091
Charming. This is charming.

01:15.125 --> 01:18.094
It reminds me of the therapist's
office Bethenny Frankel goes to

01:18.128 --> 01:20.797
on The Real Housewives
of New York City.

01:20.830 --> 01:22.132
I hate her.

01:22.166 --> 01:24.067
She looks like a wooden doll
you'd find

01:24.100 --> 01:26.403
in an Eastern European toy shop.

01:26.436 --> 01:28.738
Oh, don't act
like you don't know who she is.

01:28.772 --> 01:30.307
Please, that doesn't impress me.

01:30.340 --> 01:31.475
We live in the world.

01:31.508 --> 01:33.310
We all know
who Bethenny Frankel is,

01:33.343 --> 01:35.179
whether we like it or not.

01:35.212 --> 01:37.847
You know,
I actually don't mind her.

01:37.881 --> 01:39.849
And she's built quite a business
for herself.

01:39.883 --> 01:41.751
You have to hand it to her.

01:41.785 --> 01:45.155
I don't mean to name-drop,
but I kind of know Andy Cohen.

01:45.189 --> 01:46.623
I guess I'm his type.

01:46.656 --> 01:48.158
Which, of course,
is very flattering.

01:48.192 --> 01:49.859
He's outrageously successful.

01:49.893 --> 01:52.862
He originally wanted me
for The Rachel Zoe Project,

01:52.896 --> 01:54.864
but I said no,
so they went with Brad.

01:54.898 --> 01:57.634
And now look-- that could've
been me on Fashion Police

01:57.667 --> 01:59.836
with Melissa Rivers
14 times a year.

01:59.869 --> 02:02.539
Ah, well, hindsight.

02:02.572 --> 02:04.674
I see the tissue box is empty.

02:04.708 --> 02:06.976
Somebody was going
through those like...

02:07.010 --> 02:09.112
well, tissues.
(chuckles)

02:09.145 --> 02:11.848
Mm, I hope he didn't get cancer
all over this seat.

02:11.881 --> 02:13.483
Ugh. Yuck.

02:13.517 --> 02:14.718
Bad luck.

02:14.751 --> 02:17.053
Although I did hear
Ryan Reynolds visited him.

02:17.086 --> 02:18.622
Something to do with Deadpool,
I guess.

02:18.655 --> 02:20.290
So it's not all horrible.

02:20.324 --> 02:22.626
If they don't give us a day off
when he dies,

02:22.659 --> 02:24.528
I'm gonna be so pissed.

02:24.561 --> 02:27.697
Oh, look, you got
your Dunkin' Donuts coffee.

02:27.731 --> 02:30.166
I don't know why those cups
always depress me.

02:30.200 --> 02:32.035
It's-it's like
you've already given up

02:32.068 --> 02:33.637
before the day's even started.

02:33.670 --> 02:36.139
You might as well tattoo
"Can't afford Starbucks"

02:36.172 --> 02:37.641
on your forehead.

02:37.674 --> 02:39.042
What do I care, though?

02:39.075 --> 02:41.345
None of my business.

02:43.112 --> 02:45.081
I haven't heard of any
of the schools you went to,

02:45.114 --> 02:46.350
but I'm sure they were great.

02:46.383 --> 02:47.884
I mean, you're here, right?

02:47.917 --> 02:50.053
And why are you here, Stewie?

02:50.086 --> 02:51.421
Uh, that was lame.

02:51.455 --> 02:54.023
You seem to have
a lot of strong opinions.

02:54.057 --> 02:56.826
I do. Mostly because
I come across a lot of dicks.

02:56.860 --> 02:58.995
Or I guess
I should say "wankers."

02:59.028 --> 03:00.697
We do like that word, hmm?

03:00.730 --> 03:02.566
Or "tosser," "git," "prat,"

03:02.599 --> 03:04.234
"sod," "chuffer."

03:04.268 --> 03:06.035
Take your pick, eh,
Dr. Pritchfield?

03:06.703 --> 03:08.372
-"We"?
-Yes, "we."

03:08.405 --> 03:09.873
I'm not following.

03:09.906 --> 03:11.708
-The accent.
-The accent?

03:11.741 --> 03:13.510
You speak with a British accent.

03:13.543 --> 03:15.044
Yes, I'm aware.

03:15.078 --> 03:17.681
Well, I've often been told
that I have a British accent.

03:17.714 --> 03:19.015
Oh?

03:19.048 --> 03:21.251
That's-that's all
you're going to say?

03:21.285 --> 03:23.920
-"Oh"? -What is it
you'd like me to say, Stewie?

03:23.953 --> 03:25.922
That I have
a (bleep) British accent.

03:25.955 --> 03:28.358
I apologize,
but I can't hear it.

03:28.392 --> 03:29.959
You mean to tell me
you don't hear me speaking

03:29.993 --> 03:31.561
with a British accent right now?

03:31.595 --> 03:32.562
No.

03:32.596 --> 03:33.563
That's odd,

03:33.597 --> 03:35.198
because everybody else does.

03:35.231 --> 03:38.034
Have you spent much time
in Britain, then?

03:38.067 --> 03:39.536
(quietly):
No, I haven't.

03:39.569 --> 03:41.204
-Excuse me?
-I said no!

03:41.237 --> 03:44.040
But you're the absolute only
person who hasn't noticed it.

03:44.073 --> 03:46.376
Really? Everyone hears this?

03:46.410 --> 03:48.211
Well, just the people
who can understand me,

03:48.244 --> 03:49.713
which you appear to be one of.

03:49.746 --> 03:51.448
But that's too complicated
to go into.

03:51.481 --> 03:52.782
I'm not even sure I get it.

03:52.816 --> 03:55.319
The point is,
Stewie has a British accent.

03:55.352 --> 03:56.586
That's, like, a known thing.

03:56.620 --> 03:57.887
Ask anyone.

03:57.921 --> 03:59.723
I'm afraid I don't hear it.

03:59.756 --> 04:01.291
Yeah, you've said.

04:01.325 --> 04:03.226
It sounds
like it's very important

04:03.259 --> 04:05.295
what other people think of you.

04:05.329 --> 04:06.996
Oh, is-is that
what it sounds like?

04:07.030 --> 04:09.098
To me, it does, yes.

04:09.132 --> 04:10.434
To you it does. I see, I see.

04:10.467 --> 04:13.169
So after five minutes, you think
you know me, is that it?

04:13.202 --> 04:14.971
A little, perhaps.

04:15.004 --> 04:16.906
I am trained, Stewie,
to observe things

04:16.940 --> 04:18.241
that give me an insight.

04:18.274 --> 04:21.177
And, yes, I do feel
I know you a bit.

04:21.210 --> 04:23.347
You do feel you know me a bit.
Mm-hmm. Okay.

04:23.380 --> 04:25.649
All right, all right.
Well, that's-that's fair.

04:26.683 --> 04:28.084
Might I?

04:28.117 --> 04:30.954
I'm not sure
how this is going to help.

04:30.987 --> 04:32.155
Indulge me.

04:33.723 --> 04:35.825
Thank you.

04:35.859 --> 04:39.162
I see you're on vacation
in Rio de Janeiro in this photo

04:39.195 --> 04:40.630
with your partner, I'm guessing.

04:40.664 --> 04:42.031
Or is he your husband?

04:42.065 --> 04:44.434
Yes, probably wanted
to make it official, didn't you?

04:44.468 --> 04:46.102
Never thought you'd see it
in your lifetime.

04:46.135 --> 04:47.804
Blah, blah, blah, blah.

04:47.837 --> 04:49.539
At a quick glance,
I'd say there's roughly

04:49.573 --> 04:52.275
a 26-year age difference
between the two of you.

04:52.308 --> 04:54.344
Not quite large enough
to raise eyebrows

04:54.378 --> 04:56.613
while still giving you
a younger mind to shape.

04:56.646 --> 04:58.615
"Oh, you mean you haven't seen
All About Eve,

04:58.648 --> 05:01.117
Gypsy, Valley of the Dolls?"
Et cetera.

05:01.150 --> 05:04.488
And a younger body
to make you feel more virile.

05:04.521 --> 05:06.490
Taking into consideration
the math,

05:06.523 --> 05:08.458
he was probably born at a time

05:08.492 --> 05:10.694
when the most popular name
was...

05:10.727 --> 05:12.829
-Michael.
-(gasps)

05:12.862 --> 05:15.499
From the dog-eared pages
of that volume of Shakespeare,

05:15.532 --> 05:19.836
I imagine you wooed Michael with
a sonnet or monologue each day.

05:19.869 --> 05:22.372
And no one had ever done
anything so romantic

05:22.406 --> 05:24.641
as reciting Shakespeare
for Michael before.

05:24.674 --> 05:26.309
And he was smitten.

05:26.342 --> 05:28.044
While not
as physically attracted to you

05:28.077 --> 05:29.813
as you are to him, that's okay--

05:29.846 --> 05:32.482
you each bring something
important to the relationship.

05:32.516 --> 05:34.851
Isn't that what you believe,
Dr. Pritchfield?

05:35.852 --> 05:37.253
I see a prescription

05:37.286 --> 05:39.155
for heart medication
on that table.

05:39.188 --> 05:40.857
My guess is you keep that
at the office.

05:40.890 --> 05:42.992
You don't want to worry Michael,
you say to yourself,

05:43.026 --> 05:45.662
even though the truth is
it embarrasses you.

05:45.695 --> 05:47.330
Your age, your mortality.

05:47.363 --> 05:49.198
Best to keep appearing
as vital as possible.

05:49.232 --> 05:50.934
And no need to have reminders
at home

05:50.967 --> 05:53.670
of what's just around
the corner, is there?

05:53.703 --> 05:55.171
And your office is your haven,

05:55.204 --> 05:57.507
since Michael doesn't work
and is often at home,

05:57.541 --> 05:59.576
perhaps as a result
of a low-level depression

05:59.609 --> 06:01.511
that you don't really want
to get into with him.

06:01.545 --> 06:03.513
Oh, he always planned
to have a career,

06:03.547 --> 06:05.582
but he could never settle
on exactly what it was

06:05.615 --> 06:06.950
he wanted to do.

06:06.983 --> 06:08.452
And at first
you liked having him at home

06:08.485 --> 06:10.754
to take care of the house
and plan trips.

06:10.787 --> 06:12.422
So that's just what happened.

06:12.456 --> 06:15.759
"And that's a job, too,"
he reminds you over the years.

06:15.792 --> 06:18.428
Michael likes to travel,
and he prefers the finer things.

06:18.462 --> 06:20.363
And you'd like to give them
to him, wouldn't you?

06:20.396 --> 06:23.199
But it's a bit difficult
on a child psychologist's salary

06:23.232 --> 06:25.602
at a Rhode Island preschool,
I'd imagine.

06:25.635 --> 06:27.070
Fortunately,
you don't have children,

06:27.103 --> 06:29.473
so you do have
some disposable income.

06:29.506 --> 06:31.641
Oh, you have talked about it
with other couples,

06:31.675 --> 06:33.643
just for show,
probably at dinner

06:33.677 --> 06:35.078
with younger friends
of Michael's

06:35.111 --> 06:36.312
who are starting a family,

06:36.345 --> 06:38.147
you know,
to be part of the conversation,

06:38.181 --> 06:39.315
to feel included.

06:39.348 --> 06:40.650
But you said
you preferred your trips

06:40.684 --> 06:42.752
and your rescue dog
named after a character

06:42.786 --> 06:44.488
most likely from Dickens.

06:44.521 --> 06:46.490
Ah, how accomplished
and affluent

06:46.523 --> 06:47.991
you both look in this photo.

06:48.024 --> 06:50.794
Just the image Michael
is so desperate to project.

06:50.827 --> 06:53.062
Let's look a little closer,
shall we?

06:53.096 --> 06:55.665
Now, I see you're both wearing
Ralph Lauren Purple Label

06:55.699 --> 06:59.068
dress shirts
that retail starting at $495.

06:59.102 --> 07:01.004
But from the disfigured
button holes on one

07:01.037 --> 07:02.806
and the small discoloration
on the other,

07:02.839 --> 07:05.174
I can see you bought them
at the outlet in Providence.

07:05.208 --> 07:06.610
Probably third markdown,

07:06.643 --> 07:08.812
in which case, $49,
give or take.

07:08.845 --> 07:10.814
Since you also have
light jackets on,

07:10.847 --> 07:13.016
I can see that you went there
during summer vacation,

07:13.049 --> 07:15.151
which is, in fact,
winter in Rio,

07:15.184 --> 07:17.353
outside
of the high tourist season.

07:17.386 --> 07:19.355
And I see that you're
on the rooftop pool deck

07:19.388 --> 07:21.357
at the Fasano Hotel in Ipanema,

07:21.390 --> 07:24.293
the most exclusive hotel
in all of Brazil.

07:24.327 --> 07:26.195
Michael would've been dying
to stay there.

07:26.229 --> 07:28.364
Had a friend that went
with his older boyfriend,

07:28.397 --> 07:30.500
who makes a lot of money
in, most likely, banking,

07:30.534 --> 07:31.835
much to your chagrin.

07:31.868 --> 07:34.838
But even in August,
it's almost $1,000 a night.

07:34.871 --> 07:37.507
You tell him people are starving
in the streets in Brazil.

07:37.541 --> 07:39.709
How do you justify paying
those prices?

07:39.743 --> 07:42.045
When the truth is,
you simply can't afford it.

07:42.078 --> 07:43.980
It's for another class
of gay people.

07:44.013 --> 07:45.181
The window that Michael

07:45.214 --> 07:47.116
is always desperately
peering through

07:47.150 --> 07:48.718
and sadly on the other side of.

07:48.752 --> 07:50.186
But you do your best.

07:50.219 --> 07:52.656
You don't go on Airbnb,
because you don't trust it,

07:52.689 --> 07:54.223
even though Michael
has stories of friends

07:54.257 --> 07:56.325
who have found
the most fabulous places.

07:56.359 --> 07:57.661
You like a hotel.

07:57.694 --> 07:59.663
Besides, it's more romantic,
you tell him.

07:59.696 --> 08:02.065
But when you take him to the
place you're actually staying,

08:02.098 --> 08:05.134
the one you found on TripAdvisor
that was rated number 27

08:05.168 --> 08:06.570
of all the hotels in Rio

08:06.603 --> 08:10.073
and was having a special rate
of 295 U.S. dollars a night--

08:10.106 --> 08:12.008
which is still not cheap,
you remind him,

08:12.041 --> 08:14.678
most people never get to visit
half the places he's seen,

08:14.711 --> 08:17.547
you tell him-- you can't help
but feel like a bit of a failure

08:17.581 --> 08:19.549
as you see the look
of disappointment on his face

08:19.583 --> 08:21.250
as he enters the room.

08:21.284 --> 08:22.919
So you decide to go
to the Fasano Hotel

08:22.952 --> 08:24.921
for dinner and drinks.
No, just drinks,

08:24.954 --> 08:27.390
once you've seen
the restaurant prices online.

08:27.423 --> 08:29.593
And once there, you can see
how Michael begins looking

08:29.626 --> 08:31.527
at all the older men
who can afford

08:31.561 --> 08:33.863
to take their boyfriends--
I'm sorry, husbands--

08:33.897 --> 08:36.099
to such luxurious hotels.

08:36.132 --> 08:37.834
And you worry a little,
that you're diminishing

08:37.867 --> 08:39.836
in his eyes
with each passing year.

08:39.869 --> 08:41.771
But you tell yourself
you're being ridiculous,

08:41.805 --> 08:44.507
as you see Michael
glancing about the rooftop deck,

08:44.540 --> 08:46.175
looking at all the young men,

08:46.209 --> 08:48.712
men that would be 20 years
younger than even Michael,

08:48.745 --> 08:50.379
men that you're invisible to.

08:50.413 --> 08:52.515
But he isn't yet,
not completely,

08:52.548 --> 08:55.685
and you're jealous
and you loathe yourself for it.

08:55.719 --> 08:57.020
But Michael wants a photo,

08:57.053 --> 08:58.454
and he says,
"Let's take a selfie."

08:58.487 --> 09:00.957
But you say, "Let's ask someone
to take one of us"

09:00.990 --> 09:03.960
and make some tired joke about
selfies that only you laugh at,

09:03.993 --> 09:06.095
wishing that you could take it
out of the air

09:06.129 --> 09:08.765
as soon as you've said it,
as it's just one more indicator

09:08.798 --> 09:11.467
that you're older
than everybody here.

09:11.500 --> 09:14.470
So Michael calls over a young
man wearing a tiny swimsuit

09:14.503 --> 09:17.406
to take the photo and makes a
crude joke that embarrasses you.

09:17.440 --> 09:19.275
But the young man laughs,

09:19.308 --> 09:21.611
and he and Michael share a
moment that you're not part of.

09:21.645 --> 09:23.613
And you feel humiliated
and unseen.

09:23.647 --> 09:25.715
Which explains
Michael's joyful grin

09:25.749 --> 09:28.051
and your slightly disconnected
half-smile.

09:28.084 --> 09:30.053
And you've posted the photo
on Facebook,

09:30.086 --> 09:33.056
and Michael's posted it to
his 86 followers on Instagram--

09:33.089 --> 09:34.624
you don't know
how that one works--

09:34.658 --> 09:36.459
to at least give the impression,

09:36.492 --> 09:37.961
in your Ralph Lauren shirts,

09:37.994 --> 09:39.796
holding your $20 cocktails,

09:39.829 --> 09:42.431
that you're both way more
successful than you are.

09:42.465 --> 09:43.967
But it makes you feel
a little dirty,

09:44.000 --> 09:46.970
the lengths you have to go to
in order to keep Michael happy.

09:47.003 --> 09:49.238
And every time you glance
at this picture,

09:49.272 --> 09:52.742
you wonder,
"How long before he leaves me?"

09:52.776 --> 09:56.112
See? I guess we both know
each other a bit.

09:58.147 --> 10:01.117
You seem like
a very lonely little boy.

10:01.150 --> 10:03.519
(sobbing):
Oh, my God, I am!

10:03.552 --> 10:05.421
I'm so lonely!

10:05.454 --> 10:07.456
(sobbing)

10:07.490 --> 10:08.792
Oh!

10:08.825 --> 10:12.228
You can see inside my soul!

10:13.229 --> 10:15.765
Oh, God!

10:15.799 --> 10:17.200
(sobbing)

10:17.233 --> 10:19.235
(door opens)

10:20.236 --> 10:21.204
(sniffling)

10:21.237 --> 10:22.338
Thank you.

10:22.371 --> 10:24.874
Thank you, Barbara.

10:28.878 --> 10:31.180
Are you all right now, Stewie?

10:31.214 --> 10:32.548
Yes, I think.
(sniffles)

10:32.581 --> 10:34.117
You're very kind.

10:34.150 --> 10:36.052
She's a gem, that one, you know.

10:36.085 --> 10:37.386
I hope you appreciate her.

10:37.420 --> 10:39.588
Try taking some deep breaths.

10:40.589 --> 10:43.292
(inhales, exhales deeply)

10:43.326 --> 10:45.729
(inhales, sighs)

10:45.762 --> 10:47.496
I do this sometimes in yoga.

10:47.530 --> 10:48.732
(inhales)

10:48.765 --> 10:49.899
I take yoga.

10:49.933 --> 10:51.400
(exhales, inhales)

10:51.434 --> 10:52.702
I have a sick body.

10:52.736 --> 10:54.570
(exhales, inhales)

10:54.603 --> 10:56.072
(exhales)

10:56.105 --> 10:58.674
I do... I do feel a bit better.

10:58.708 --> 11:00.676
But still lonely.

11:00.710 --> 11:02.578
I'm sorry.
It keeps spilling out.

11:02.611 --> 11:05.248
(crying):
Oh, God. Oh, God.

11:05.281 --> 11:08.384
It seems like you're keeping
a lot bottled up inside.

11:08.417 --> 11:11.387
I am. Nobody here likes me,
Dr. Pritchfield.

11:11.420 --> 11:13.522
I try to fit in
with the other boys

11:13.556 --> 11:15.725
and talk about things
like dirt and shapes,

11:15.759 --> 11:17.193
but they won't play with me.

11:17.226 --> 11:18.862
And I-I don't have any friends,

11:18.895 --> 11:21.164
and I have nobody
to eat lunch with.

11:21.197 --> 11:23.266
It's very interesting you'd say
that you have no friends,

11:23.299 --> 11:26.569
Stewie, especially considering
the reason you're here.

11:26.602 --> 11:28.037
Oh. That.

11:28.071 --> 11:29.705
Shall we talk about it?

11:29.739 --> 11:31.440
I don't know
what there is to talk about.

11:31.474 --> 11:33.910
You pushed a classmate
down the stairs.

11:33.943 --> 11:34.911
It was an accident.

11:34.944 --> 11:36.612
Haven't you ever seen Showgirls?

11:36.645 --> 11:37.613
Yes, of course I have.

11:37.646 --> 11:38.915
But, according to Tyler,

11:38.948 --> 11:40.583
it was no accident.

11:40.616 --> 11:42.886
Well, I guess it's my word
against his, then.

11:42.919 --> 11:44.888
It is creating
a bit of a con-trah-versy.

11:44.921 --> 11:46.689
-Excuse me?
-A con-trah-versy.

11:46.722 --> 11:48.925
-I don't know what that is.
-Con-trah-versy?

11:48.958 --> 11:50.459
"Con-trah-versy"?

11:50.493 --> 11:52.595
Oh! Oh, "con-troversy."

11:52.628 --> 11:55.364
Apologies.
Those of us with British accents

11:55.398 --> 11:56.900
pronounce it "con-trah-versy."

11:56.933 --> 11:58.434
But how would you know that?

11:58.467 --> 11:59.602
Yeah, how would I know that?

11:59.635 --> 12:00.904
Look, Dr. Pritchfield...

12:00.937 --> 12:02.438
"Cee-cil," if I may?

12:02.471 --> 12:04.107
It's pronounced "Cess-il."

12:04.140 --> 12:05.909
-Damn it!
-But, again, how would you know?

12:05.942 --> 12:08.611
-It's not as if you're...
-Okay, okay, we got it.

12:08.644 --> 12:10.880
I only pushed Tyler down
the stairs because I like him

12:10.914 --> 12:12.448
and I'm afraid
he won't like me back.

12:12.481 --> 12:14.951
And-and not like him-like him.
I'm not gay.

12:14.984 --> 12:17.553
This whole thing isn't because
I'm gay, so-so calm down.

12:17.586 --> 12:19.622
I can already see you
lickin' your chops.

12:19.655 --> 12:22.658
I'm sure you live
for the coming out sessions.

12:22.691 --> 12:25.294
If anything,
I'm less gay than I used to be.

12:25.328 --> 12:27.630
Not that anybody
at this school would care.

12:27.663 --> 12:30.133
But do I think that
Grant Gustin and I would make

12:30.166 --> 12:31.801
the most adorable
Instagram couple?

12:31.835 --> 12:33.769
Yes. Yes, we would.

12:33.803 --> 12:36.806
Grant Gustin plays the Flash on
the CW, if you were wondering.

12:36.840 --> 12:38.908
Because, you know,
most people over 70

12:38.942 --> 12:41.144
probably don't know who he is.

12:41.177 --> 12:43.746
Think young Anthony Perkins.

12:43.779 --> 12:45.481
Ah. Oh.

12:45.514 --> 12:47.083
There we go.

12:47.116 --> 12:48.684
Anyway, "fluid"
is something I hear

12:48.717 --> 12:50.253
being tossed around a lot now.

12:50.286 --> 12:52.655
But I'm confident
in my heterosexuality.

12:52.688 --> 12:54.924
-That's a word, right?
-Yes, of course.

12:54.958 --> 12:57.760
Okay, just sounded strange
for a second.

12:57.793 --> 13:01.264
It must be difficult for you,
Stewie, being so intelligent.

13:01.297 --> 13:02.765
It is.

13:02.798 --> 13:04.968
Whew! Just that...

13:05.001 --> 13:06.970
just that acknowledgement.

13:07.003 --> 13:09.873
You know, sometimes
I don't know where I fit in.

13:09.906 --> 13:13.542
I just... I just want
to be like everybody else,

13:13.576 --> 13:16.712
but nobody's interested in the
things that I'm interested in.

13:16.745 --> 13:18.114
They think I'm weird.

13:18.147 --> 13:19.883
And I'm so anxious all the time,

13:19.916 --> 13:23.019
but I... I always put on
a brave face and try to hide it,

13:23.052 --> 13:25.388
and I... I give myself
these excruciating migraines.

13:25.421 --> 13:27.957
I actually have
way more hair than this,

13:27.991 --> 13:30.159
but I pull it out.

13:30.193 --> 13:32.461
I'm sorry, now I'm getting
all worked up again.

13:32.495 --> 13:34.497
I'm worse than Bethenny Frankel
on her period.

13:34.530 --> 13:36.365
I don't why
I keep bringing her up.

13:36.399 --> 13:38.667
I j... it's just I think
about her a lot.

13:38.701 --> 13:41.470
Well, what are the things
you're interested in, Stewie?

13:41.504 --> 13:44.207
Me? Well, I like to talk
about world domination.

13:44.240 --> 13:47.010
Some people don't think
I talk about it enough anymore,

13:47.043 --> 13:49.845
but mind your own beeswax
is what I say to them.

13:49.879 --> 13:51.981
I also like to talk
about musicals.

13:52.015 --> 13:54.317
It's hard to find someone
who can converse

13:54.350 --> 13:56.352
on one of those topics,
let alone both.

13:56.385 --> 13:58.654
And I really, really,
really want to see Hamilton,

13:58.687 --> 14:01.190
but by the time
it gets here, I'll be 30.

14:01.224 --> 14:04.093
I think I'm still the only one
in town who's even (hiccups)

14:04.127 --> 14:06.695
heard of it, and it's been out
for over two years.

14:06.729 --> 14:09.065
Which just makes me
even more (hiccups) depressed.

14:09.098 --> 14:11.367
How do you live
in a place like that?

14:11.400 --> 14:13.236
Quahog. What a pile of garbage.

14:13.269 --> 14:15.104
And I've even memorized
some of the songs,

14:15.138 --> 14:18.041
but I have no one to sing
it for, and I'm really good.

14:18.074 --> 14:20.276
-Do you want to hear it?
-Oh. Um...

14:20.309 --> 14:21.911
Y-You mean now?

14:21.945 --> 14:24.914
I really... I really need you
to hear me sing Hamilton.

14:24.948 --> 14:27.883
(crying): I'm so good.
Why can't I be on Broadway?

14:27.917 --> 14:29.452
I want to be on Broadway.

14:29.485 --> 14:33.022
I want the world to fall in love
with me eight times a week.

14:33.056 --> 14:34.924
I'd love to hear you sing.

14:34.958 --> 14:36.960
Okay, okay, now I'm nervous.

14:36.993 --> 14:40.196
If it's not good this time, just
remember it was good at home.

14:40.229 --> 14:42.065
Don't look at me while I start.

14:42.098 --> 14:43.299
It's hard.

14:43.332 --> 14:45.368
It's a lot of words very fast.

14:45.401 --> 14:48.204
Like Gilbert and Sullivan,
but for Hispanics.

14:48.237 --> 14:50.306

16:21.597 --> 16:23.332
Well done!

16:23.366 --> 16:26.035
You're a very special
little boy, Stewie.

16:26.069 --> 16:28.071
I saw you check your watch.

16:28.104 --> 16:30.206
That was a bit emotional
for you, wasn't it?

16:30.239 --> 16:33.676
But it felt good. Like-like,
I got so much out, you know?

16:33.709 --> 16:37.413
-Would you like a cup of tea?
-I would love a cup of tea.

16:40.949 --> 16:43.052
It's hot already?

16:43.086 --> 16:45.188
Yes, it's an electric kettle.

16:45.221 --> 16:47.022
We don't have that at our house.

16:47.056 --> 16:50.093
My mother boils water
in an old Jiffy Pop tin.

16:50.126 --> 16:52.161
She's just a useless old slut.

16:52.195 --> 16:54.197
Hey, my hiccups are gone!

16:54.230 --> 16:57.266
If you liked Tyler and you
wanted to be friends with him,

16:57.300 --> 16:59.835
then why did you
push him down the stairs?

16:59.868 --> 17:01.504
Oh. I...

17:01.537 --> 17:03.106
I don't know.

17:03.139 --> 17:06.075
Can I tell you a story
about another little boy?

17:06.109 --> 17:07.876
Um, okay.

17:07.910 --> 17:10.113
When I was your age,
I grew up in London

17:10.146 --> 17:13.216
-when the Blitz had just ended.
-Good God, how old are you?

17:13.249 --> 17:15.951
Our neighborhood
was reduced to rubble.

17:15.984 --> 17:19.355
♪

17:19.388 --> 17:22.891
And in the chaos, I searched
desperately for my parents.

17:24.093 --> 17:26.028
Mum. Mum.

17:26.061 --> 17:27.863
Mother. Mother.

17:27.896 --> 17:29.865
Mum. Mummy.

17:29.898 --> 17:32.735
Mummy. Mummy. Mummy.

17:32.768 --> 17:35.204
Mummy. Mum. Mother.

17:35.238 --> 17:37.039
-STEWIE: Don't.
-PRITCHFIELD: Don't what?

17:37.072 --> 17:38.574
STEWIE:
You know what.

17:38.607 --> 17:40.709
PRITCHFIELD: But Mother
was nowhere to be found.

17:40.743 --> 17:43.712
And neither was Father.

17:43.746 --> 17:47.150
You see, I was
the sole survivor of my family.

17:47.183 --> 17:49.552
So I was sent to live
with an aunt in Cornwall.

17:49.585 --> 17:53.389
But she had too many mouths
of her own to feed, so...

17:53.422 --> 17:56.725
I was next sent to a distant
cousin in Northumberland.

17:56.759 --> 17:58.494
But she didn't care
for children,

17:58.527 --> 18:00.129
and off again I went,

18:00.163 --> 18:02.498
this time to an orphanage
in Gloucestershire.

18:02.531 --> 18:03.932
But they didn't like
little boys

18:03.966 --> 18:05.268
from London
in Gloucestershire.

18:05.301 --> 18:07.403
Or from Cornwall
or Northumberland.

18:07.436 --> 18:10.573
So I pretended I was from
Shropshire, of all places.

18:10.606 --> 18:13.742
And eventually,
I became friends with six boys:

18:13.776 --> 18:16.745
Sebastian, Declan,
Flibbit, Pipadoodle,

18:16.779 --> 18:19.582
Scudger and Nonsenseword.

18:19.615 --> 18:21.083
And together, we traveled...

18:21.116 --> 18:23.018
STEWIE: Okay, before you say
another name of anything,

18:23.051 --> 18:24.487
I'm going to have to stop you.

18:24.520 --> 18:26.589
-Yes?
-I'm only here for 40 minutes,

18:26.622 --> 18:28.691
and this is already
a really long story

18:28.724 --> 18:30.526
with a lot of locations.

18:30.559 --> 18:33.762
And I don't feel like waiting to
see how it links up to my thing.

18:33.796 --> 18:35.364
The point of the story is,

18:35.398 --> 18:37.333
I know what it's like
to feel alone

18:37.366 --> 18:39.868
and to have to pretend that
you're something you're not.

18:39.902 --> 18:44.540
Oh, and also, how my first kiss
was with a Nazi.

18:44.573 --> 18:47.210
See? We didn't need
to go back 1,000 years for that.

18:47.243 --> 18:49.011
And I don't pretend
I'm something I'm not.

18:49.044 --> 18:50.946
-I never said that.
-You just said it.

18:50.979 --> 18:52.681
I might have implied it.

18:52.715 --> 18:56.719
I suppose the question is why
you feel the need to do that.

18:56.752 --> 18:59.021
I... I don't know.

18:59.054 --> 19:02.191
I-I guess
I hadn't realized it before.

19:02.225 --> 19:05.694
Maybe I'm worried
nobody's going to like me.

19:05.728 --> 19:08.231
Lois left a tissue
in the dryer again.

19:08.264 --> 19:11.367
And these are my only pants.
How sad is that?

19:11.400 --> 19:14.637
When I was in the orphanage,
my Sunday shoes were potatoes.

19:14.670 --> 19:16.372
Well, you win that one.

19:16.405 --> 19:18.140
Look, I'm different,
Dr. Pritchfield.

19:18.173 --> 19:19.742
I'm not like the other kids.

19:19.775 --> 19:22.077
I realized that
when you picked up that photo

19:22.110 --> 19:24.079
and decimated my entire life.

19:24.112 --> 19:26.315
Sorry. It's kind of
a parlor trick of mine.

19:26.349 --> 19:28.251
Have you ever thought
of just being yourself--

19:28.284 --> 19:31.254
your real self--
and then see what happens?

19:31.287 --> 19:33.756
I... I don't think I know how.

19:33.789 --> 19:37.260
Everything about me is this
carefully constructed persona

19:37.293 --> 19:39.194
designed
to keep people at arm's length.

19:39.228 --> 19:41.397
This isn't even
how I really talk.

19:41.430 --> 19:44.199
(with American accent):
This is. This is how I talk.

19:44.233 --> 19:46.369
The accent is-is nothing more
than an affectation,

19:46.402 --> 19:48.771
a-a coat of armor
to get me through the day,

19:48.804 --> 19:51.407
just an image I cultivated
so I could feel special.

19:51.440 --> 19:53.041
(exhales)

19:53.075 --> 19:55.878
Wow. What a relief.

19:55.911 --> 19:58.180
For once, to talk
with my real voice

19:58.213 --> 19:59.748
without the... the burden

19:59.782 --> 20:01.617
of trying to sound
like someone I'm not.

20:01.650 --> 20:04.219
-What do you mean by that?
-Well, this is my real voice.

20:04.253 --> 20:05.888
I don't hear a difference.

20:05.921 --> 20:08.223
(in Peter's voice): How about
now? You freakin' hear that?

20:08.257 --> 20:10.092
(as Quagmire): What about now?
Sound different? Giggity?

20:10.125 --> 20:11.360
(as Brian):
What about now?

20:11.394 --> 20:13.061
(as Tom Tucker):
Coming up now, this voice.

20:13.095 --> 20:14.263
(as Seamus):
Ahoy. It's me.

20:14.297 --> 20:16.299
(as Roger):
And I'm a gay alien.

20:16.332 --> 20:19.302
I'm sorry. That just all sounds
like the same person.

20:24.673 --> 20:27.876
Well, Stewie, that was quite
a breakthrough we just had.

20:27.910 --> 20:29.578
How do you feel?

20:29.612 --> 20:32.815
(in American accent):
I feel... relieved,

20:32.848 --> 20:34.483
like a weight has been lifted.

20:34.517 --> 20:36.319
I-I can finally be myself.

20:36.352 --> 20:38.421
I like this Stewie.

20:38.454 --> 20:40.489
I hope he stays for a while.

20:40.523 --> 20:43.992
I-I've never been vulnerable
to anyone before.

20:44.026 --> 20:46.629
You're the only one
who's ever met the real me.

20:46.662 --> 20:47.996
Well, I'm honored, and now,

20:48.030 --> 20:50.232
the rest of the world is going
to meet him.

20:50.265 --> 20:51.734
Yes. Yes, that's right.

20:51.767 --> 20:53.569
There's no going back now!

20:53.602 --> 20:55.771
I'm gonna talk to Tyler.
I'm gonna make friends.

20:55.804 --> 20:57.340
I'm gonna be a normal boy!

20:57.373 --> 20:59.074
Yes, you are.

20:59.107 --> 21:01.410
You're finally going
to be just like everybody else.

21:01.444 --> 21:04.913
Wha-what? Say-say that again.

21:04.947 --> 21:07.916
You're finally going
to be just like everybody else.

21:07.950 --> 21:10.519
But... But I don't...

21:10.553 --> 21:14.189
(in his British accent): I don't
want to be like everybody else.

21:14.222 --> 21:15.424
What do you mean?

21:15.458 --> 21:17.292
I-I don't want to be like them.

21:17.326 --> 21:20.529
Like any other zero in this
miserable town, like my family.

21:20.563 --> 21:23.532
I won't do it! I don't want
to be like any other person!

21:23.566 --> 21:24.767
Like you skiing in...

21:24.800 --> 21:26.369
Please don't pick up that photo.

21:26.402 --> 21:28.303
I want to remain
what I've always been--

21:28.337 --> 21:30.606
superior, brilliant, special.

21:30.639 --> 21:32.441
Oh, God, what was I thinking?!

21:32.475 --> 21:34.877
I'm never going
to lift the veil, ever.

21:34.910 --> 21:37.546
Nobody will ever know
the real me.

21:37.580 --> 21:38.981
My accent's back, by the way.

21:39.014 --> 21:40.483
It was a very dramatic moment.

21:40.516 --> 21:42.518
If you say so.

21:42.551 --> 21:44.119
Now, let's talk about...

21:44.152 --> 21:47.856
(groaning)

21:51.494 --> 21:54.797
Stewie, can you hand me
my heart medication, please?

21:54.830 --> 21:56.865
Of course!

21:56.899 --> 21:59.402
Except...

21:59.435 --> 22:01.970
there's one person
that does know the real me,

22:02.004 --> 22:04.072
and that's you.

22:04.106 --> 22:05.374
I don't understand.

22:05.408 --> 22:07.743
Why aren't you getting
my medication?

22:07.776 --> 22:09.678
(inhales sharply)
Mm, yeah.

22:09.712 --> 22:12.247
Listen, you're not
gonna like this.

22:12.280 --> 22:14.249
Please, there's not much time.

22:14.282 --> 22:16.985
I'd like to, really I would,
and you were super helpful,

22:17.019 --> 22:20.022
and this... this kind of seems
like a crummy way to repay you,

22:20.055 --> 22:21.824
but... I'm not going to get it.

22:21.857 --> 22:23.992
Is this because I made you wait?

22:24.026 --> 22:26.395
It's because I can't have anyone
know the real me.

22:26.429 --> 22:28.096
And so you must die.

22:28.130 --> 22:30.666
I guess that's what happens
in therapy, though.

22:30.699 --> 22:32.835
No, it's not!

22:32.868 --> 22:34.837
Ah, you're right.
That didn't make much sense.

22:34.870 --> 22:36.371
Not to sound ghoulish,

22:36.405 --> 22:38.941
but any indication how much
longer you're going to linger?

22:38.974 --> 22:40.275
I'm not sure.

22:40.308 --> 22:41.944
(gasping) I think
it's different for everyone.

22:41.977 --> 22:43.679
Yeah, because you're still
pretty chatty, is...

22:43.712 --> 22:44.847
is why I'm wondering.

22:44.880 --> 22:46.381
Don't do this, Stewie!

22:46.415 --> 22:48.016
It will stay with you forever.

22:48.050 --> 22:51.019
Mm, yeah, not worried.
For me, this is kind of no bigs.

22:51.053 --> 22:53.355
Barbara! Barbara!

22:53.388 --> 22:55.057
Oh, didn't you hear her
go to lunch?

22:55.090 --> 22:57.392
It was like an orchestra
of squeaky chair springs

22:57.426 --> 22:59.795
and groaning floorboards
playing her out.

22:59.828 --> 23:02.765
So... this is how you leave me.

23:02.798 --> 23:04.500
Sowwy.

23:07.302 --> 23:10.439
"Eyes, look your last!

23:10.473 --> 23:13.809
"Arms, take your last embrace.

to know,
