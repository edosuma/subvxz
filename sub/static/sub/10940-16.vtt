Maggie's Diner.

00:04.902 --> 00:06.563
Oh! Oh, my God!

00:06.670 --> 00:08.035
You are supposed to be Peter.

00:08.205 --> 00:09.365
And you're supposed to be Sam.

00:09.473 --> 00:11.407
Why didn't you tell me
you work for Bedford Oil?

00:11.508 --> 00:13.271
I own Bedford.

00:14.811 --> 00:16.403
Don't tell my daughter about this.

00:16.513 --> 00:17.537
Let's just say now you've got

00:17.648 --> 00:19.206
all the sponsorship
you're gonna need.

00:19.316 --> 00:20.544
What are you looking at?

00:20.717 --> 00:21.445
Nothing.

00:21.552 --> 00:22.678
Whatever.

00:22.786 --> 00:24.515
I think it might just be a phase.

00:24.621 --> 00:25.679
I just made a promise.

00:25.789 --> 00:26.778
Yeah, to me.

00:26.990 --> 00:28.582
Hey, I know you'll do great
at the rodeo.

00:28.692 --> 00:30.284
Yeah. Thanks.

00:33.564 --> 00:35.555
Got you.

01:15.739 --> 01:18.606
I never thought
I was the jealous type.

01:18.709 --> 01:20.506
But then,
I've never dated a guy

01:20.611 --> 01:22.875
whose best friend
is a girl before.

01:22.980 --> 01:25.039
I'll get used to it.

01:25.148 --> 01:26.206
Just for the record,

01:26.316 --> 01:29.479
I've had a few run-ins
with the green monster myself.

01:29.586 --> 01:30.780
Oh, yeah?

01:30.887 --> 01:32.980
Yeah.

01:33.090 --> 01:36.491
Well, you have nothing
to worry about.

01:43.166 --> 01:44.326
I'm sorry, I...

01:47.571 --> 01:48.765
Didn't mean to interrupt.

01:48.872 --> 01:50.737
I'll see you later.

01:50.841 --> 01:52.138
See you.

01:54.211 --> 01:55.337
Nice to see you again, Amy.

01:56.380 --> 01:58.348
See you.

02:00.284 --> 02:03.720
So, looks like you two
really worked things out.

02:03.820 --> 02:05.515
Yeah.

02:05.622 --> 02:06.987
That's good.

02:07.090 --> 02:09.650
Here. I'll get that for you.

02:09.759 --> 02:11.159
Thank you.

02:23.507 --> 02:25.304
Do you hear that?

02:25.409 --> 02:27.001
What?

02:28.545 --> 02:32.538
I don't know.
It's probably just the wind.

02:33.717 --> 02:34.911
It's gonna be a nice night.

02:35.018 --> 02:36.815
Do you want me
to turn Spartan out for you?

02:36.920 --> 02:38.353
No.

02:38.455 --> 02:40.047
I just...

02:40.157 --> 02:41.681
I'd really rather he stays in, okay?

02:42.426 --> 02:45.088
Is everything okay?

02:46.263 --> 02:48.094
Yeah.

03:38.849 --> 03:41.283
Hey, it's not even dawn.
Where you going?

03:41.385 --> 03:44.183
I just want to check on Spartan.

03:50.193 --> 03:51.160
Ty!

03:57.334 --> 03:58.631
Ty!

04:04.174 --> 04:05.539
Ty, Spartan's gone.

04:54.858 --> 04:56.951
Okay, so we've got
Highwood auction today.

04:57.060 --> 04:58.459
We still have Innisfail
next weekend.

04:58.562 --> 05:01.190
And then Olds, Stavely,
and Strathmore.

05:01.298 --> 05:06.065
Amy, we've been to four
of these things in the past week.

05:06.169 --> 05:07.363
You know what the police said.

05:07.471 --> 05:08.563
Whoever stole Spartan

05:08.672 --> 05:11.232
isn't gonna risk selling him
at an auction house.

05:11.341 --> 05:13.275
I'm gonna find him, Ty.

05:13.376 --> 05:15.810
I just feel it.

05:26.423 --> 05:27.651
What?

05:27.757 --> 05:29.281
Your...

05:29.726 --> 05:33.389
It's cascading down your face
like two big mudslides.

05:33.497 --> 05:35.055
Why can't Mr. Internet

05:35.165 --> 05:36.530
send chocolate
or jelly beans

05:36.633 --> 05:37.395
or something?

05:37.501 --> 05:38.399
All this shrubbery

05:38.502 --> 05:39.901
is driving my allergies crazy.

05:40.003 --> 05:41.800
Mallory, you don't have allergies.

05:44.641 --> 05:46.666
I can't believe Spartan's gone.

05:46.776 --> 05:47.902
I know.

05:48.011 --> 05:49.808
I just saw Amy just staring

05:49.913 --> 05:51.403
at his empty stall.

05:51.515 --> 05:53.244
I don't even know what to say to her.

05:53.350 --> 05:55.409
There's not much
we can say to her, you know?

05:55.519 --> 05:59.683
We just have to let her know
we're there for her and...

05:59.789 --> 06:03.384
You can put these posters up
at school tomorrow.

06:03.493 --> 06:05.552
Darn allergies.

06:10.200 --> 06:11.724
Allergies.

06:12.736 --> 06:14.465
Got it.

06:14.571 --> 06:17.199
Grandpa, you know, we have got
to do something about Amy.

06:17.307 --> 06:19.798
She doesn't eat.
She barely sleeps.

06:19.910 --> 06:23.175
It's just livestock papers,
horse auctions,

06:23.280 --> 06:26.078
the Internet,
"Missing" posters.

06:26.182 --> 06:27.376
She is going to crash.

06:27.484 --> 06:29.315
I know.

06:29.419 --> 06:31.284
I've tried talking to her about it.

06:31.388 --> 06:32.912
But that sister of yours,

06:33.023 --> 06:37.551
when she gets something in her head,
it is at full speed.

06:46.937 --> 06:47.699
Ty!

06:47.804 --> 06:49.101
Ty, look!

06:52.509 --> 06:53.601
Come on!

06:58.415 --> 06:59.347
Spartan?

07:14.130 --> 07:16.325
Sure are a lot
of beautiful horses here.

07:16.433 --> 07:17.730
Yeah.

07:19.803 --> 07:22.499
You ever think
about buying another one?

07:22.606 --> 07:25.734
Why would I want another horse?

07:29.546 --> 07:30.945
Amy.

07:31.047 --> 07:33.413
I know this is hard for you.

07:33.516 --> 07:36.974
I don't want to sound harsh,
but we have to face facts.

07:37.087 --> 07:38.349
You may not find him.

08:17.127 --> 08:19.027
Hey, Harley.

08:19.796 --> 08:20.956
49.

08:30.774 --> 08:33.072
How about 1,800?

08:33.243 --> 08:34.505
1,800?

08:34.644 --> 08:36.407
1,800.
How about 1,900?

08:36.513 --> 08:38.413
How about 2,000?

08:38.548 --> 08:41.278
How about 2,100?

08:41.384 --> 08:44.581
2,100? 2,200?

08:44.721 --> 08:45.710
And sold him.

08:45.822 --> 08:47.881
He goes to the gentleman
in the black cowboy hat.

08:47.991 --> 08:48.923
Next block we got

08:49.025 --> 08:51.050
a rising 2-year-old bay gelding
coming in here.

08:51.161 --> 08:52.219
Name's Harley.

08:52.328 --> 08:54.421
Good, strong, athletic body on him.

08:54.531 --> 08:56.499
From a pleasure horse
to a jumping horse.

08:56.599 --> 08:59.534
- He's a beauty, isn't he?
- Number 49 is the number to buy.

08:59.636 --> 09:01.103
Yeah.

09:02.439 --> 09:04.066
Wouldn't take long
for you to break him.

09:05.275 --> 09:06.799
Ty, don't go there.

09:09.112 --> 09:11.046
How about 500?
700 now.

09:12.315 --> 09:14.408
Ty, what are you doing?

09:14.517 --> 09:15.575
Buying a horse.

09:15.685 --> 09:16.481
900 going.

09:16.586 --> 09:17.746
1,000 now.

09:17.887 --> 09:21.288
1,000 now.
How about 1,050?

09:21.391 --> 09:22.289
1,050.

09:22.425 --> 09:23.653
1,050.
Now 1,100.

09:23.760 --> 09:25.921
How about 1,100?

09:26.029 --> 09:28.293
Sold him. $1,050.

09:28.398 --> 09:31.424
- Good eye there, young man.
- How are you gonna pay for him?

09:31.534 --> 09:34.970
- I've been saving money.
- Yeah, for a motorcycle.

09:35.071 --> 09:37.596
He's kind of like a motorcycle.
His name's Harley.

09:37.707 --> 09:41.268
Okay, next horse coming
into the ring is lot number 51.

09:41.377 --> 09:43.436
No information on the card
on this horse.

09:43.546 --> 09:45.673
So, I guess just buy him
as you see him.

09:45.782 --> 09:47.409
Certainly acts gentle.

09:47.517 --> 09:50.714
All righty.
And a decent rate on him, too.

09:50.820 --> 09:53.983
Have a look at him, boys.
25. Let's go.

10:00.764 --> 10:03.255
Amy! I think it's Spartan.

10:09.472 --> 10:11.167
Ty, that's him.

10:11.274 --> 10:14.107
Sold the horse.
1,800. Buyer number 61.

10:14.210 --> 10:16.804
Second time. 1,800.

10:18.047 --> 10:20.675
That's Wes.

10:23.553 --> 10:25.043
Hey, Spartan.

10:25.155 --> 10:26.213
It's all right.

10:26.322 --> 10:28.051
Hey, buddy, that one's sold.

10:31.427 --> 10:32.951
You.

10:34.597 --> 10:36.087
What the hell are you doing
with my horse?

10:36.199 --> 10:38.360
- It's not your horse.
- Get out of here.

10:40.970 --> 10:42.062
Mr. Carlstrom?

10:45.542 --> 10:46.509
That's me.

10:46.609 --> 10:49.134
Tom Wheatley.
Brand inspector.

10:49.245 --> 10:52.976
Looks like we might have
a slight complication on our hands.

10:53.116 --> 10:56.051
This young lady here seems to think
you just bought her stolen horse.

10:56.152 --> 10:58.086
I got the papers right here.

10:58.188 --> 11:00.713
So what? She's got
some registration papers.

11:00.824 --> 11:02.451
Where's the bill of sale?

11:02.559 --> 11:04.356
Well, we didn't get one.

11:05.929 --> 11:07.191
You don't have a bill of sale?

11:07.297 --> 11:09.663
Well, my mom, when she...
When...

11:09.766 --> 11:12.667
The guy we bought him from
didn't give us one.

11:12.769 --> 11:15.260
These papers are meaningless
without one.

11:15.371 --> 11:16.736
We gonna be much longer?

11:16.840 --> 11:18.740
Sorry for the inconvenience,
Mr. Carlstrom.

11:18.842 --> 11:19.968
Load-out's that way.

11:20.076 --> 11:21.065
- No.
- What?

11:21.211 --> 11:23.873
No, no! You can't do this!
That's my horse!

11:23.980 --> 11:26.710
I'm sorry, Miss Fleming.

11:28.351 --> 11:30.478
Stop it! You're hurting him!

11:30.587 --> 11:32.350
This is my horse! You...

11:32.455 --> 11:34.616
Wes! Wes, I'll buy him back from you!

11:34.724 --> 11:37.454
Amy. There's nothing we can do.

11:37.560 --> 11:39.460
- Not now, anyway.
- It's my horse!

11:39.562 --> 11:41.120
You can't do this!
You don't understand!

11:41.231 --> 11:44.359
That guy tried
to burn down our barn!

11:51.373 --> 11:52.863
I'm gonna have to come back
later tonight

11:52.974 --> 11:54.771
to pick the horses up, Dutch.

11:54.876 --> 11:56.901
If I can find new tires by then.

11:57.012 --> 11:58.536
I'll put 'em in the barn.

12:00.916 --> 12:02.713
You little...!

12:05.320 --> 12:08.050
Not a good idea.

12:08.890 --> 12:09.914
Didn't want him leaving

12:10.025 --> 12:11.925
before we talked
to the brand inspector.

12:12.027 --> 12:14.928
Didn't really help, did it?

12:16.798 --> 12:19.699
Well, thank you, Constable.
Appreciate your time.

12:21.203 --> 12:23.501
Nobody knows
who Spartan's seller was.

12:23.605 --> 12:24.629
Surprise, surprise.

12:24.739 --> 12:28.175
Used a fake name, fake I.D.

12:28.276 --> 12:30.938
He's probably long gone
by now, Amy.

12:31.046 --> 12:33.105
What about Wes?
What's he doing out of jail?

12:33.335 --> 12:34.950
Well, he plead guilty
to a lesser charge,

12:34.950 --> 12:36.645
did some time,
and he's out on good behavior.

12:36.751 --> 12:39.276
Good behavior?
He almost killed you.

12:39.387 --> 12:40.615
I'll find him.

12:40.722 --> 12:43.555
What, you want to find Wes?
Why would you do that, Grandpa?

12:43.722 --> 12:45.555
So I can make him an offer
he can't refuse.

12:46.394 --> 12:48.385
I got something for him, too,
and it's not money.

12:48.497 --> 12:50.624
Well, don't the police know
where he is?

12:50.732 --> 12:53.360
Might be in town.
Might be just passing through.

12:53.468 --> 12:54.935
There's got to be something
we can do.

12:55.036 --> 12:56.731
Not much without a bill of sale.

12:56.838 --> 13:01.400
Remember, you didn't exactly
buy Spartan from Mallen.

13:05.380 --> 13:09.407
Okay. Well, I'll make a few calls.
I'll let you know what I find out.

13:13.088 --> 13:14.419
I bought her a colt.

13:14.523 --> 13:16.218
You what?

13:16.324 --> 13:18.189
Bought Amy
a two-year-old bay gelding.

13:18.293 --> 13:19.885
Thought it might
take her mind off Spartan.

13:21.830 --> 13:23.593
Well, it's a nice thought, Ty.

13:23.698 --> 13:25.791
But when someone's dog dies,

13:25.901 --> 13:31.168
you can't just buy them a new puppy
and think everything's gonna be okay.

13:31.740 --> 13:34.937
Just give her some time.

13:53.929 --> 13:55.920
Amy.

13:56.798 --> 13:59.358
He was all I had left of her.

14:00.202 --> 14:02.636
Your mom?

14:06.107 --> 14:09.235
She died trying to save him.

14:09.744 --> 14:12.975
Now it's like he's dead, too.

14:15.217 --> 14:16.741
Hey.

14:21.223 --> 14:23.123
It's okay.

14:46.915 --> 14:48.815
I'll give you twice
what you paid for Spartan.

14:51.586 --> 14:52.678
You got a death wish, punk?

14:52.787 --> 14:56.086
Your little tire-slashing stunt's
costing me time and money.

14:56.191 --> 14:58.125
You're lucky I don't
kick your ass right now.

14:58.226 --> 14:59.454
Three times what you paid.

14:59.561 --> 15:00.721
I wouldn't sell you that horse

15:00.829 --> 15:03.024
if I was down
to my last frickin' penny.

15:03.131 --> 15:05.861
Now, get out of my face
before I rearrange yours.

15:14.442 --> 15:16.239
That's for breaking my beer.

15:17.245 --> 15:20.737
And this is for plain bugging me
with that ugly baby face of yours.

15:25.453 --> 15:26.886
That's for buying Spartan.

15:26.988 --> 15:27.977
And this...

15:29.090 --> 15:30.819
This is for just being an ass.

15:35.764 --> 15:39.359
Thanks for the beer.
I'll be sure to toast you.

15:39.467 --> 15:42.061
You're a dead man, Borden.

15:53.481 --> 15:55.813
Hey, boy.

15:59.321 --> 16:02.654
What's wrong?
You miss your buddy, don't you?

16:02.757 --> 16:04.782
Me too.

16:06.127 --> 16:10.154
Could be your new look
is scaring him a bit.

16:10.765 --> 16:12.960
Well, he probably thinks
you're a raccoon.

16:26.147 --> 16:31.744
"Ballet in Calgary tonight.
Pick you up at 6:30."

16:42.130 --> 16:43.188
Peter.

16:43.298 --> 16:45.664
Hey, it's Lou. Listen.

16:45.767 --> 16:48.964
The ballet tonight sounds wonderful.
But you really...

16:49.070 --> 16:51.504
You don't have to come pick me up
all the way at the ranch.

16:51.606 --> 16:54.632
I mean, I can just easily meet you
at the theater, okay?

16:54.743 --> 16:57.769
I hope you get this message.
Okay. Bye.

16:57.879 --> 16:59.744
Was that the Internet guy?

16:59.848 --> 17:01.907
Mallory.

17:02.183 --> 17:05.016
You're meeting him in the city?
Alone?

17:05.119 --> 17:06.848
And why haven't we met this guy?

17:07.922 --> 17:10.356
You know what? You have nothing
to worry about, okay?

17:10.458 --> 17:11.925
Because he's a really nice guy.

17:12.026 --> 17:13.550
Yeah. And so was Ted Bundy.

17:14.863 --> 17:16.125
It is a beautiful day outside.

17:16.231 --> 17:18.994
What are you doing
cooped up in here?

17:21.102 --> 17:23.569
Okay, look.
Mallory, I'll tell you what.

17:23.671 --> 17:25.468
You go tack up Copper,

17:25.573 --> 17:28.473
and me and you can go
for a trail ride, okay?

17:28.576 --> 17:31.067
I don't feel like it.

17:43.792 --> 17:46.226
Hey, uh, how was
your afternoon with Kit?

17:48.196 --> 17:51.256
Oh, my God. When you guys fight,
you don't hold back.

17:51.366 --> 17:53.300
It's not from Kit, okay?

17:53.401 --> 17:55.801
Had a bit of a run-in with Wes.

17:56.571 --> 17:57.663
How did you find him?

17:57.772 --> 18:00.104
Pulled a favor from Clint.

18:00.708 --> 18:02.232
He knew a guy who knew a guy.

18:02.343 --> 18:05.938
Anyway, I offered to pay him
three times what he paid for Spartan.

18:06.047 --> 18:07.014
This was his answer.

18:11.519 --> 18:12.816
What are those for?

18:12.921 --> 18:17.358
Um, I was just planning
on fixing fences later.

18:22.831 --> 18:24.594
Ty, no! Ty, give it back!

18:25.533 --> 18:27.967
Binoculars? Flashlight?

18:28.069 --> 18:30.230
You planning on fixing fences
in the dark?

18:31.473 --> 18:33.100
I'm gonna bring Spartan back.

18:33.208 --> 18:34.368
He is my horse.

18:34.476 --> 18:36.137
And no one's gonna take him
from me.

18:36.244 --> 18:38.735
And how you gonna get Spartan
out of a locked auction house

18:38.847 --> 18:40.144
with a security guard on site?

18:40.248 --> 18:42.546
I got it under control.

18:42.650 --> 18:43.674
Come on, Amy.

18:43.785 --> 18:46.583
Theft over $500 is a felony.
You can go to jail.

18:46.688 --> 18:48.087
Well, I'm not planning
on getting caught.

18:48.189 --> 18:50.987
This is a really, really
bad idea, okay?

18:51.092 --> 18:53.060
I've been to jail.
It's not a fun place.

18:53.161 --> 18:54.321
And I don't ever want to go back.

18:54.496 --> 18:57.260
I'm not asking for your help.

19:00.368 --> 19:02.962
Amy, come on. Please.
Don't do this.

19:03.071 --> 19:05.062
I'm gonna get Spartan back.

19:11.479 --> 19:13.037
What time do we leave?

19:13.147 --> 19:15.638
9:30.

19:16.518 --> 19:18.816
Okay.

19:30.631 --> 19:32.895
- Hey, Lou.
- Hey, are you okay?

19:33.000 --> 19:35.059
Yeah. Great.

19:35.169 --> 19:36.830
Okay.

19:40.274 --> 19:41.332
Hey, um...

19:42.376 --> 19:44.867
Are you sure you're okay
with me going out tonight?

19:44.979 --> 19:46.071
Yeah. Absolutely.

19:46.180 --> 19:47.477
'Cause I can stay.

19:47.648 --> 19:49.479
No. Go. Have fun.

19:49.583 --> 19:51.380
Okay.

19:51.485 --> 19:53.749
And you know you can call me
on my cell phone

19:53.854 --> 19:55.321
if you need anything and...

19:55.489 --> 19:57.320
Lou.

19:57.424 --> 19:59.790
Okay.

20:06.100 --> 20:07.089
Hey, um...

20:07.201 --> 20:08.862
Do I look okay?

20:08.969 --> 20:12.029
Yeah. You look great.

20:13.073 --> 20:14.938
Okay.

20:15.542 --> 20:16.770
Go on. Go have fun.

20:16.877 --> 20:18.777
Okay.

20:22.549 --> 20:24.676
- You on your way out?
- Yeah.

20:24.785 --> 20:26.753
Have a good night.

20:26.854 --> 20:28.879
You too.

20:34.361 --> 20:35.851
Hey.

20:37.898 --> 20:39.763
Everything okay?

20:39.867 --> 20:41.698
Yeah. I...

20:41.802 --> 20:45.738
I just forgot my keys somewhere.

20:46.307 --> 20:50.403
Oh, here they are.
In my purse.

20:50.511 --> 20:53.105
Silly me.

20:53.514 --> 20:55.175
Okay.

20:55.282 --> 20:57.011
Bye.

20:58.319 --> 21:00.480
- Didn't you get my message?
- Yeah, I did.

21:00.587 --> 21:02.885
What kind of guy lets his date
drive herself to the ballet?

21:02.990 --> 21:04.787
- What was that all about?
- What?

21:04.892 --> 21:06.655
You just closed the door
in my face.

21:06.760 --> 21:08.284
Oh, we just got a puppy.

21:08.395 --> 21:10.829
I didn't want the puppy to get out.

22:06.605 --> 20:41:09.536
**** me up?

22:08.589 --> 22:09.783
What are you doing here?

22:09.890 --> 22:11.585
I can't believe you left without me.

22:11.692 --> 22:13.182
- Go home. Amy!
- I'm not going anywhere.

22:13.293 --> 22:15.557
It's too risky, okay?
Jack would kill me if we got caught.

22:15.662 --> 22:18.222
- Now, please go.
- No.

22:20.768 --> 22:24.568
Looks like someone
borrowed my truck.

22:24.671 --> 22:27.299
I expect she'll be back soon enough.
Do you want to stay?

22:27.408 --> 22:29.137
I think Ty put some beer
in the fridge.

22:29.243 --> 22:32.212
Sure.
Yeah, a beer sounds good.

22:32.312 --> 22:36.578
So, congratulations
on getting your rodeo card.

22:36.683 --> 22:38.048
Thanks.

22:38.152 --> 22:40.143
When are you heading south?

22:40.254 --> 22:41.354
I don't know.

22:41.355 --> 22:43.789
You know, still got to work out
the financial end.

22:43.891 --> 22:46.223
So, you ever think
about getting a sponsor?

22:46.326 --> 22:48.692
Well, that's kind of what
I wanted to talk to Amy about.

22:49.696 --> 22:50.924
Oh?

22:51.098 --> 22:53.896
I was approached
by a business owner.

22:54.001 --> 22:57.835
But I'm just not sure
it's gonna work out.

22:57.938 --> 22:59.599
She's...

22:59.706 --> 23:03.142
Well, I think she wants to sponsor me
for all the wrong reasons.

23:06.246 --> 23:08.544
To keep me away
from a certain someone.

23:08.649 --> 23:10.947
Oh, I see.

23:11.118 --> 23:12.346
Wouldn't have something to do

23:12.453 --> 23:15.911
with your living arrangement,
would it?

23:16.023 --> 23:16.990
Might.

23:18.225 --> 23:21.717
Well, I suppose
it's none of my business.

23:22.162 --> 23:26.223
So this potential sponsor of yours...
What's your gut tell you?

23:26.333 --> 23:28.324
Not to cash the check.

23:28.435 --> 23:31.336
You might want to listen to that.

23:49.523 --> 23:51.047
These things are so dull.

23:51.158 --> 23:53.092
- Let me try. Here.
- No, I got it. I got it.

23:53.193 --> 23:55.218
- Amy, let me try.
- Okay.

23:55.329 --> 23:57.729
Give me this.

24:00.868 --> 24:02.995
- We don't have time for this.
- Told you they were dull.

24:03.103 --> 24:05.401
They're not dull.
It's a Kryptonite lock.

24:05.506 --> 24:07.770
You couldn't bust that thing
with a sledgehammer.

24:07.875 --> 24:09.433
Use this.

24:11.612 --> 24:12.806
Come on.

24:12.913 --> 24:14.778
There we go.

24:14.882 --> 24:17.077
Okay, that was pretty impressive.

24:17.184 --> 24:20.176
- I've seen every
- Impossible" movie there is.

24:21.021 --> 24:23.751
No, wait! The alarm.

24:26.927 --> 24:28.861
Okay. Go.

24:35.202 --> 24:36.328
There he is.

24:41.708 --> 24:43.039
Give me the halter.

24:43.176 --> 24:44.609
Easy.

24:47.014 --> 24:48.413
Easy, boy. Easy.

24:48.515 --> 24:50.813
Come on. You're all right.
Look, it's just me.

24:50.918 --> 24:52.681
- Get the halter on him fast.
- I'm trying.

24:54.855 --> 24:56.823
- Someone's coming.
- Go, go, go, go.

24:59.693 --> 25:00.625
Ty, hurry.

25:06.600 --> 25:09.865
So, it's you making all the noise.

25:09.970 --> 25:11.335
What's your problem, huh?

25:12.372 --> 25:13.896
What's spooking you now?

25:23.183 --> 25:25.617
What the hell are you doing
sneaking up on me?

25:25.719 --> 25:27.653
Who else you expecting?

25:27.754 --> 25:28.743
You're late.

25:28.855 --> 25:30.948
It took me a while to get
the damn tires on the trailer.

25:31.058 --> 25:33.117
Get that light out of my face.

25:38.865 --> 25:39.456
Whoa!

25:39.633 --> 25:41.260
Simmer down.

25:41.368 --> 25:43.495
Let's load the other two out first.

25:43.604 --> 25:45.003
Why?

25:45.105 --> 25:46.868
This guy's been spooky all night.

25:46.974 --> 25:48.942
Have a feeling he's gonna fight us
at the trailer.

25:49.042 --> 25:50.737
Attitude.

25:51.445 --> 25:53.879
Just like his previous owner.

25:53.981 --> 25:57.542
- Where are the others?
- By the load-out door.

26:05.759 --> 26:07.420
We have to go fast.

26:14.301 --> 26:17.566
It's okay, boy. Easy. Easy.

26:20.841 --> 26:23.002
Spartan!

26:26.046 --> 26:27.206
Spartan!

26:36.490 --> 26:37.855
Amy, you have to get out of here.

26:37.958 --> 26:39.357
- I'll get Spartan out on my own.
- No.

26:39.459 --> 26:42.986
Amy, please.
Wait for me in the field, okay?

26:47.401 --> 26:49.562
Ty, turn that off. Turn it off.

26:52.773 --> 26:54.400
I just want to get you home.

26:55.575 --> 26:56.872
Here you go.

27:00.013 --> 27:01.037
Good boy.

27:01.148 --> 27:03.639
- Amy, we don't have time for this.
- Come on.

27:08.021 --> 27:09.454
Here. The door is chained.

27:09.556 --> 27:12.184
I'll take Spartan.
You go and open the door.

27:17.297 --> 27:18.958
Don't move!

27:21.668 --> 27:24.034
Not this time, Ty.

27:33.346 --> 27:35.610
Well, I guess I better be going.

27:35.716 --> 27:38.048
I'll let Amy know you dropped by.

27:38.151 --> 27:39.584
Thanks for the advice, Jack.

27:39.686 --> 27:42.780
In the end, it's your choice.

27:47.360 --> 27:49.385
See you.

27:53.533 --> 27:55.626
Hello.

27:56.069 --> 27:57.832
Oh, okay. Just slow down.

27:57.938 --> 28:00.498
I can't understand
a word you're saying.

28:01.541 --> 28:03.031
I'll be right there.

28:03.143 --> 28:05.441
Oh, my gosh! What happened?
Is Lou okay?

28:05.545 --> 28:07.445
I hope so.
It's the other one.

28:07.547 --> 28:09.913
- I'm coming.
- No, you're staying put.

28:10.083 --> 28:11.107
But, Jack!

28:11.218 --> 28:15.678
Girls are gonna send me
to the boneyard before my time.

28:48.855 --> 28:50.846
Um, hey.

28:50.957 --> 28:52.652
I'm just gonna hop out here, okay?

28:52.759 --> 28:54.522
Can I get dropped off here, please?

28:54.628 --> 28:56.926
Just at the driveway.

28:57.030 --> 28:58.793
Why here?

28:58.899 --> 29:01.390
Because I had
such a wonderful night

29:01.501 --> 29:05.028
that I just want to walk
under the stars and take it all in.

29:05.138 --> 29:07.538
I just don't want my night
to end, okay?

29:07.641 --> 29:10.075
Here in the freezing cold
and pitch black

29:10.177 --> 29:12.372
with coyotes
and God knows what else?

29:12.479 --> 29:15.209
Yeah. I'm a country girl.
I can handle it, okay?

29:15.315 --> 29:17.806
Yeah? Crazy country girl
is what you are.

29:19.686 --> 29:21.119
At least let me walk you up.

29:21.221 --> 29:23.655
Oh, no. It's fine. Really.

29:23.757 --> 29:28.194
I could walk this road
blindfolded, backwards, okay?

29:28.295 --> 29:30.195
Yeah. In stilettos?

29:30.297 --> 29:34.893
Look, I had a really, really
nice time tonight.

29:35.001 --> 29:36.161
Thank you.

29:49.850 --> 29:52.375
- Okay. Good night.
- Okay.

29:54.654 --> 29:56.815
- Be careful.
- Bye.

30:13.206 --> 30:14.639
Grandpa?

30:15.909 --> 30:19.367
Could it be any colder outside?

30:19.479 --> 30:22.209
My feet are killing me.

30:24.584 --> 30:26.779
Ty's in jail.

30:48.408 --> 30:50.774
Say something, Jack.

30:50.877 --> 30:54.335
You don't want to hear
what I've got to say.

31:10.764 --> 31:12.857
- Eat.
- I'm not hungry.

31:12.966 --> 31:14.558
Amy, you have been saying that
for a week.

31:14.668 --> 31:16.397
You are gonna collapse
if you keep this up.

31:16.503 --> 31:17.663
So eat.

31:27.681 --> 31:29.808
Thank God!

31:31.885 --> 31:33.409
Grandpa.

31:33.520 --> 31:34.452
Grandpa.

31:34.621 --> 31:36.452
I know I've disappointed you.

31:36.556 --> 31:40.083
And I know
what I did was wrong, but...

31:40.193 --> 31:42.718
I just got carried away. And...

31:43.563 --> 31:45.087
This is not Ty's fault at all.

31:45.198 --> 31:49.897
He tried to talk me out of it,
and I just didn't listen.

31:50.003 --> 31:51.061
I'm really sorry.

31:51.171 --> 31:53.969
What the hell were you thinking?

31:54.207 --> 31:55.333
Huh?

31:57.711 --> 32:01.010
You both could have ended up
behind those steel bars.

32:01.114 --> 32:03.605
I managed to bail him out.

32:03.717 --> 32:06.345
But if he's convicted,
he won't be going back to juvie.

32:06.453 --> 32:10.651
He'll be looking at serious jail time
with hardened criminals!

32:46.092 --> 32:47.184
Hey, Ty.

32:49.262 --> 32:51.389
Um, I...

32:52.632 --> 32:54.293
I'm so sorry.

32:54.401 --> 32:56.733
You know, I should have
listened to you.

32:56.836 --> 32:59.600
You know, you told me
this was a bad idea,

32:59.706 --> 33:03.767
and that I shouldn't have done it,
and...

33:04.577 --> 33:08.411
I don't know. I'm just...
I'm so stupid sometimes.

33:08.515 --> 33:10.676
No, you're not stupid.

33:10.784 --> 33:14.914
You're just passionate.

33:15.321 --> 33:18.256
I'd do it again in a second.

33:23.396 --> 33:25.887
I'd do anything for you.

33:48.521 --> 33:50.045
Are you going to jail?

33:51.057 --> 33:53.150
I don't know. Maybe.

33:53.259 --> 33:55.386
That would totally suck
if they put you in the slammer

33:55.495 --> 33:58.896
for trying to bring Spartan home.

33:59.132 --> 34:01.726
But I thought it was pretty cool
what you did.

34:02.735 --> 34:06.694
No, it wasn't cool, Mallory.
There was nothing cool about it.

34:20.253 --> 34:23.916
I know everyone's been ragging
on you about your new look.

34:24.023 --> 34:28.255
I don't care what you do.
But maybe Copper does.

34:43.208 --> 34:45.837
Hey, um, I've been thinking.

34:45.978 --> 34:47.139
Uh-oh.

34:48.047 --> 34:49.708
I'm serious.

34:49.815 --> 34:51.909
Something's been bugging me.

34:52.018 --> 34:55.784
Do you remember
what that security-guard guy, Dutch,

34:55.889 --> 34:57.880
he said to Wes
when he showed up?

34:57.991 --> 34:59.686
Yeah. He said, "You're late."

34:59.792 --> 35:02.590
Yeah, like he was
expecting him or something.

35:02.695 --> 35:06.187
And when Wes was looking
at his slashed tires,

35:06.299 --> 35:07.891
Dutch was right there with him.

35:08.001 --> 35:09.730
You think they're working together?

35:09.836 --> 35:11.963
Don't you think
it's a bit of a coincidence

35:12.071 --> 35:13.902
that Wes gets out of jail

35:14.007 --> 35:16.737
and then Spartan
just happens to get stolen?

35:16.843 --> 35:19.437
And then Wes
just happens to buy him.

35:19.546 --> 35:25.348
But the thing I don't get is,
why would Wes buy him back?

35:25.451 --> 35:27.681
To make it legal.

35:27.787 --> 35:29.414
It's like a money-laundering thing.

35:29.522 --> 35:30.819
One guy steals the horse.

35:30.924 --> 35:32.516
The other guy takes it
to the auction house.

35:32.625 --> 35:34.855
Then the thief buys it back,
gets a legitimate bill of sale,

35:34.961 --> 35:36.952
then turns around
and sells the horse for more money.

35:38.965 --> 35:40.455
Okay. Let's go tell Grandpa.

35:43.469 --> 35:45.096
What you've got is a theory.

35:45.205 --> 35:46.866
But it makes perfect sense, Grandpa.

35:46.973 --> 35:48.668
So did your little horse caper.

35:48.775 --> 35:49.901
He's in it for the money, Jack.

35:50.043 --> 35:51.908
Okay.

35:52.011 --> 35:54.036
- Let's just say you're right.
- I know we are.

35:54.147 --> 35:55.580
I know what to do.
All we have to...

35:55.682 --> 35:57.377
You're not doing anything.

35:57.517 --> 36:00.645
- Look, Jack.
- And neither are you.

36:04.591 --> 36:10.029
Just leave it up
to the grown-ups this time.

36:13.866 --> 36:15.231
Where's Spartan?

36:15.335 --> 36:17.064
Spartan who?

36:18.204 --> 36:20.570
Try it again, Jack.
I adjusted his hearing.

36:20.673 --> 36:23.005
Wes.

36:23.109 --> 36:24.974
Shake the man's hand.

36:28.748 --> 36:30.909
I should have burned that barn down
with you in it.

36:31.017 --> 36:33.952
Well, that's kind
of what happened, Wes.

36:35.588 --> 36:38.352
We know about your little deal
with the auction house.

36:46.065 --> 36:49.000
I talked to your buddy, Dutch.

36:49.102 --> 36:51.161
It's amazing how a guy
will spill his guts

36:51.271 --> 36:53.000
when you offer him
a whack of cash.

36:53.106 --> 36:54.664
You're bluffing.

36:59.812 --> 37:02.280
I think the cops would have this
wrapped up in an hour or two.

37:02.382 --> 37:03.474
What do you think, Jack?

37:03.583 --> 37:06.211
Why don't you just tell us
where we can get our horse,

37:06.319 --> 37:09.015
and we'll be on our way?

37:09.455 --> 37:11.355
Okay. Okay, okay.

37:11.457 --> 37:12.617
Baker's Field.

37:12.725 --> 37:14.488
A mile down River Road.

37:14.594 --> 37:17.028
My hand.
You're gonna break it.

37:17.130 --> 37:18.188
Come on, Wes.

37:18.298 --> 37:21.358
Just a good old-fashioned
cowboy handshake.

37:23.870 --> 37:26.430
Sign it. Right here.

37:28.007 --> 37:29.474
Bill of sale.

37:29.575 --> 37:31.008
Attaboy.

37:32.178 --> 37:35.238
Pleasure doing business
with you, Wes.

37:42.522 --> 37:44.217
Nice bluff.

37:44.324 --> 37:45.916
Wasn't sure it was gonna work.

37:46.025 --> 37:49.188
I think I dislocated a knuckle.

37:49.295 --> 37:53.356
I pulled a muscle
in my good shoulder.

38:04.009 --> 38:04.805
Hey.

38:07.212 --> 38:10.409
What's with the SOS call?

38:14.820 --> 38:18.847
You got your rodeo sponsor!
That's great!

38:21.093 --> 38:22.117
What's wrong?

38:22.227 --> 38:24.957
Look who wrote the check.

38:26.698 --> 38:29.292
Val Stanton. So?

38:29.401 --> 38:30.868
I can't do it.

38:31.503 --> 38:32.367
Why not?

38:32.471 --> 38:33.369
I just can't.

38:33.472 --> 38:36.100
She's trying to buy me off
to keep me away from Ashley.

38:36.275 --> 38:37.435
Caleb.

38:37.542 --> 38:39.533
Ashley's your friend, right?

38:39.645 --> 38:41.442
So, she'll understand.

38:41.546 --> 38:43.537
She'd want you to follow your dream.
Come on.

38:43.682 --> 38:45.172
Just think about it, okay?

38:46.618 --> 38:48.745
Okay.

38:57.462 --> 38:58.520
Jack, how did you...?

38:59.598 --> 39:00.860
Long story.

39:00.999 --> 39:02.091
Hey, Spartan.

39:02.200 --> 39:05.101
I did have a little chat
with Constable Rodriguez, though.

39:06.104 --> 39:08.766
I don't know if he still has
a thing for Lou or what,

39:08.874 --> 39:11.707
but he's agreed to forget

39:11.810 --> 39:14.938
this little indiscretion of yours
ever happened.

39:15.047 --> 39:16.344
Your file will disappear

39:16.515 --> 39:21.111
right after you've done two months
of community-service work.

39:21.219 --> 39:23.517
You mean, I'm not going...?

39:25.057 --> 39:26.957
No.

39:31.296 --> 39:32.558
Thank you, Jack.

39:32.664 --> 39:33.358
Ow!

39:37.569 --> 39:38.695
Don't ask.

39:38.804 --> 39:40.032
Thank you.

39:41.373 --> 39:43.034
Thank you. Thank you.

39:43.475 --> 39:46.171
Don't start celebrating too fast,
you two.

39:46.845 --> 39:50.941
You, young lady, you are grounded
until further notice.

39:51.950 --> 39:53.577
And you...

39:53.685 --> 39:57.382
You think you're working
long hours now, you just wait.

39:57.489 --> 40:00.583
This community-service idea.
That doesn't come from the police.

40:00.692 --> 40:02.250
That comes from me.

40:02.361 --> 40:04.921
And you can start
by cleaning out the septic tank

40:05.030 --> 40:06.998
right about now.

40:07.766 --> 40:09.495
Yes, sir.

40:25.517 --> 40:26.449
Hey.

40:27.619 --> 40:29.814
- Hi.
- I heard the good news.

40:29.988 --> 40:32.786
Yes. My boy's back.
Aren't you, boy?

40:32.891 --> 40:35.951
So, I got myself
a pro rodeo sponsorship.

40:38.029 --> 40:39.394
When do you leave?

40:39.498 --> 40:40.965
Well, that all depends.

40:41.066 --> 40:44.035
I mean, I could stay
for a couple more weeks.

40:50.142 --> 40:54.670
Then again, weather's turning,
so, I'll probably head out today.

40:56.081 --> 40:58.549
We're gonna be a little shorthanded
over here, aren't we?

40:59.151 --> 41:01.813
Ah, you'll find someone.

41:02.287 --> 41:04.118
Yeah, I guess.

41:06.558 --> 41:07.582
Well...

41:08.960 --> 41:10.325
Well...

41:10.429 --> 41:11.987
Good luck.

41:12.164 --> 41:14.155
Thanks.

41:15.434 --> 41:18.301
Hey, I'll see you.

41:19.371 --> 41:21.498
Yes, you will.

41:34.820 --> 41:38.449
Try not to make my mansion
too girly while I'm gone.

41:38.557 --> 41:40.252
I'll try.

41:40.358 --> 41:42.826
And don't forget to kick the heater
when it conks out.

41:42.928 --> 41:45.954
I will.

41:47.199 --> 41:49.360
I'm gonna miss you, cowboy.

41:49.468 --> 41:51.800
I'm gonna miss you, too.

41:54.406 --> 41:56.033
Here.

41:56.875 --> 41:58.069
What's this?

41:58.176 --> 42:01.339
It's to put your belt buckles in.

42:14.893 --> 42:16.224
Well...

42:17.162 --> 42:19.062
I guess I'd better get going.

42:19.164 --> 42:20.392
Yeah.

42:20.499 --> 42:23.866
