Would you have gone through
with it if I had?

43:06.890 --> 43:11.054
No.
Well, then I didn't know.

43:11.128 --> 43:14.325
Al--
Hey, she's gonna
do the triple.

43:14.398 --> 43:16.559
[ Sighs ]
And if she doesn't do it
with you catching her,

43:16.633 --> 43:19.602
she's gonna do it with Laszlo,
and that's certain death.

43:19.670 --> 43:23.265
Now you start pumping
and get in position.

43:23.340 --> 43:26.207
Do what you have to do.
I'm gonna watch this downstairs.

43:26.276 --> 43:30.178
<i>[ Drumroll ]</i>

43:36.319 --> 43:39.152
And now, please,

43:39.222 --> 43:43.124
your complete and total silence.

43:53.070 --> 43:56.267
<i>[ Announcer ]</i>
<i>Once again,</i>
<i>because of the severe danger,</i>

43:56.339 --> 43:59.331
<i>there must be complete</i>
<i>and total silence...</i>

43:59.409 --> 44:01.741
<i>during the next several minutes.</i>

44:38.482 --> 44:40.950
- All right!
- [ Cheering ]

44:41.017 --> 44:44.783
<i>(music) [ Band ]</i>

44:50.560 --> 44:54.519
[ Eva Laughing ]
Is the net up?

45:09.846 --> 45:12.178
<i>[ Announcer ]</i>
<i>Eva and Victor,</i>

45:12.249 --> 45:17.277
<i>those incomparable</i>
<i>Flying Panzinis!</i>

45:17.354 --> 45:20.983
[ Cheering ]

45:28.431 --> 45:32.834
Ladies and gentlemen,
Eva's father, and the greatest
catcher of all time,

45:32.903 --> 45:36.498
Laszlo Panzini.

45:37.841 --> 45:39.706
I don't know
if I could do that again.

45:39.776 --> 45:42.677
Ah, well, sometimes it's,
uh, once is enough.

45:42.746 --> 45:45.044
But personally,
that's not my opinion.

45:45.115 --> 45:48.278
That's not what I'm talking about.
Why haven't you leaped?

45:49.619 --> 45:51.644
<i>[ Al ]</i>
<i>Well, I think maybe</i>
<i>you're gonna find out.</i>

45:51.721 --> 45:54.246
Ladies and gentlemen,
the Flying Panzinis.

45:54.324 --> 45:58.693
How many times do I have to tell you?
When you are up there
and the spotlight hits--

45:58.762 --> 46:01.526
<i>Please direct your attention</i>
<i>to ring one.</i>

46:01.598 --> 46:03.759
Wave to the crowd.

46:03.834 --> 46:07.895
<i>And in ring three</i>
<i>with our performing elephants.</i>
I must have forgotten.

46:07.971 --> 46:11.168
Just don't forget next time.

46:12.676 --> 46:16.043
I won't, Papa.

46:16.112 --> 46:20.606
<i>(music) [ Continues ]</i>

46:32.662 --> 46:37.190
<i>Buster! Buster! Hurry!</i>

46:40.036 --> 46:42.800
The basket!
G-Get the basket!

46:42.873 --> 46:45.239
Come on!

46:46.843 --> 46:48.777
Come on.
Before Reed catches us.

46:58.855 --> 47:02.484
Buster, what are you
thinking about?

47:02.559 --> 47:04.254
Bunny?

47:04.327 --> 47:07.319
Oh, Buster, I love you
so much for doing this.

47:07.397 --> 47:10.127
<i>[ Baby Fussing ]</i>
Oh, shoot. We woke her.

47:10.200 --> 47:12.168
Come here, precious.

47:14.971 --> 47:16.438
Oh, boy.
