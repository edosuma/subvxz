00:25.405 --> 00:28.164
An eye for an eye.
It sends a message.

00:28.165 --> 00:31.364
Sire, it was an isolated incident.

00:31.365 --> 00:34.484
And a forceful response
will ensure it remains so.

00:34.485 --> 00:37.164
The King must be seen to be just.

00:37.165 --> 00:39.325
This is justice.

00:44.085 --> 00:47.164
An affront on authority
will not be tolerated.

00:47.165 --> 00:48.644
No, Sire.

00:48.645 --> 00:50.005
So...

00:51.005 --> 00:53.445
The rebuke is already under way.

00:56.965 --> 00:59.005
SCREAMING AND SHOUTING

01:00.885 --> 01:03.285
No women, no children!

01:06.365 --> 01:07.885
Tristan!

01:30.245 --> 01:32.285
SCREAMING AND SHOUTING

01:39.125 --> 01:40.885
<font color="cyan">Tristan!</font> Tristan!

01:45.565 --> 01:46.885
Tristan!

01:49.885 --> 01:51.645
Train your weapons!

01:53.765 --> 01:55.925
Arr... Arrgh!

01:57.125 --> 01:59.685
<font color="yellow">Stand back!</font> Bastien, no.

02:02.085 --> 02:03.605
Arr... Arrgh!

02:04.605 --> 02:06.165
Argh!

02:20.165 --> 02:22.165
Evil must be extracted.

02:23.165 --> 02:26.285
Sever the root and it will wither.

02:31.845 --> 02:34.645
THEME MUSIC: Outro
by M83

02:37.165 --> 02:41.645
# I'm the king of my own land

02:46.645 --> 02:50.404
# Facing tempests of dust

02:50.405 --> 02:55.285
# I'll fight until the end

02:58.885 --> 03:01.484
# Creatures of my dreams

03:01.485 --> 03:04.725
# Raise up and dance with me

03:13.405 --> 03:16.404
# Now and forever

03:16.405 --> 03:23.445
# I'm your king. #

03:46.165 --> 03:47.645
Come on.

03:50.885 --> 03:53.405
You, come on. Get in there!

03:54.405 --> 03:55.885
Come on!

03:58.125 --> 03:59.684
Come on! You!

03:59.685 --> 04:01.645
Arrgh!

04:05.165 --> 04:06.884
Stay close.

04:06.885 --> 04:08.885
I'll see you right.

04:10.085 --> 04:12.165
I haven't done anything.

04:28.165 --> 04:30.884
Put my clothes besides the bed,
please.

04:30.885 --> 04:32.965
That is not why I am here.

04:35.645 --> 04:39.325
I believe Her Majesty's expecting
a messenger. <font color="cyan">You believe wrong.</font>

04:40.325 --> 04:42.165
I have news.

04:43.165 --> 04:45.165
From the Emperor.

04:49.165 --> 04:51.605
Do you play with me, Duchesse?

04:52.605 --> 04:54.645
I simply follow orders.

04:57.285 --> 04:59.965
One word from me
and you could lose your head.

05:00.965 --> 05:02.525
As could you.

05:04.885 --> 05:06.885
How do I know I can trust you?

05:09.405 --> 05:12.165
Because I know who gave you
that brooch.

05:14.685 --> 05:17.525
You would betray your king?

05:19.405 --> 05:22.045
You would betray your husband?

05:24.405 --> 05:28.165
You must find a way to persuade
the King to let you leave tomorrow.

05:30.405 --> 05:33.404
I'll ensure Princess Eleanor
joins you in the forest

05:33.405 --> 05:36.645
so she can ride with you to Madrid
to marry your brother.

06:26.165 --> 06:28.885
Why not? The moon is in our favour.

06:29.885 --> 06:31.565
I don't think so.

06:32.885 --> 06:35.005
It's your duty as my husband.

06:40.645 --> 06:43.485
Another child won't cure your pain.

06:47.245 --> 06:49.125
KNOCK ON DOOR

06:51.405 --> 06:54.645
The Queen requests your presence
as a matter of urgency.

06:59.165 --> 07:00.884
I don't know how,

07:00.885 --> 07:03.885
but Madame de Maintenon
has cursed us.

07:14.885 --> 07:20.165
Cain, brother of Abel. Two brothers
drenched in blood and cursed!

07:26.405 --> 07:28.164
No, that's not right.

07:28.165 --> 07:32.005
Make it,
"Tu querido hermano, Charles."

07:54.965 --> 07:57.164
How may I serve Your Majesty?

07:57.165 --> 07:59.165
I'm so glad you could come.

08:07.285 --> 08:10.245
It's... from Madrid.

08:11.245 --> 08:12.884
My brother sickens.

08:12.885 --> 08:15.285
I fear he'll not survive the summer.

08:17.405 --> 08:19.444
I'm so sorry.

08:19.445 --> 08:22.045
I have to see him one final time.

08:23.045 --> 08:24.405
Is that possible?

08:25.405 --> 08:28.644
Perhaps together we could persuade
the King this afternoon.

08:28.645 --> 08:31.884
He's always valued your honesty
and kindness

08:31.885 --> 08:35.124
and you know what it is
to be separated from family.

08:35.125 --> 08:37.164
Of course.

08:40.405 --> 08:44.645
I can teach you how to gamble
and when to raise the stakes.

08:46.165 --> 08:50.165
How to gain favour
and how to make others lose it.

08:51.885 --> 08:53.645
How to hook a man...

08:55.165 --> 08:57.165
..and how to land him.

08:59.165 --> 09:04.165
And most important, how to use
the most powerful weapon you have.

09:05.165 --> 09:07.645
That delicate flower God gave you.

09:10.405 --> 09:12.164
We should meet...

09:12.165 --> 09:15.165
away from prying eyes
and eager ears.

09:21.645 --> 09:24.884
<font color="cyan">You could plead for him.
</font><font color="lime">They won't listen.</font>

09:24.885 --> 09:27.884
<font color="cyan">But you have business at the palace.
</font><font color="lime">Yes...</font>

09:27.885 --> 09:31.245
Oh, for God's sake, they could
be torturing him right now.

09:32.245 --> 09:34.404
They might even kill him.

09:34.405 --> 09:36.404
We'll do what we can.

09:36.405 --> 09:39.885
We'll beg for him.
We'll go on our knees if we have to.

09:46.805 --> 09:48.884
You provoked the king once before

09:48.885 --> 09:52.724
<font color="lime">and you were lucky to get away
with it.</font> Tristan is a child.

09:52.725 --> 09:55.164
I don't want us mixed up with this.

09:55.165 --> 09:57.245
The King will be merciful.

09:58.245 --> 10:00.164
We owe this to our people.

10:00.165 --> 10:04.324
No, we owe it to them to keep this
business going. What good'll it do
if there's no work?

10:04.325 --> 10:06.645
Then we're mixed up in this already.

10:17.245 --> 10:21.404
It is our belief that man can have
a direct relationship with God.

10:21.405 --> 10:24.404
We may need priests
to illuminate our lives

10:24.405 --> 10:26.524
and show us the path to God.

10:26.525 --> 10:29.724
But they cannot take the place
of God.

10:29.725 --> 10:32.164
They cannot talk to God
on our behalf

10:32.165 --> 10:36.365
and they do not need to
because we can do so ourselves.

10:37.365 --> 10:39.124
But surely in saying this,

10:39.125 --> 10:41.644
you question the place
of those in authority.

10:41.645 --> 10:43.844
Not just the King, but the Pope.

10:43.845 --> 10:47.284
No-one respects the King
or the Pope more than I.

10:47.285 --> 10:50.164
And what about matters of the flesh?

10:50.165 --> 10:51.644
Be more precise.

10:51.645 --> 10:53.444
But not too precise.

10:53.445 --> 10:55.684
Are intimate relations
between man and woman

10:55.685 --> 10:57.644
encouraged in the Protestant faith?

10:57.645 --> 11:00.284
Are Catholics not encouraged
to have intercourse?

11:00.285 --> 11:02.124
I meant outside marriage.

11:02.125 --> 11:05.684
I personally consider intercourse
between a man and a woman

11:05.685 --> 11:08.164
to be a healthy activity
at all times.

11:08.165 --> 11:09.924
Well, who doesn't?

11:09.925 --> 11:13.564
The Church does not see it
quite that way.

11:13.565 --> 11:17.444
<font color="lime">I believe them to be wrong.
</font>You would defy your own Church?

11:17.445 --> 11:19.164
No.

11:19.165 --> 11:22.644
But I have the right to think freely
and question the world.

11:22.645 --> 11:25.244
And no-one will take
that right away.

11:25.245 --> 11:26.805
Bravo.

11:27.805 --> 11:29.165
Bravo!

11:34.605 --> 11:38.004
Bracing, isn't it, to be challenged
in one's thinking?

11:38.005 --> 11:41.164
Well, that's not your only
challenge. What do you mean?

11:41.165 --> 11:44.404
The fabulously wealthy widow
whom you're trying to seduce.

11:44.405 --> 11:46.164
Don't be ridiculous.

11:46.165 --> 11:49.404
Just as well,
because you haven't a chance.

11:49.405 --> 11:51.165
And why not?

11:53.165 --> 11:54.925
Because she knows you.

12:00.245 --> 12:03.405
<font color="cyan">What is the matter with him?
</font><font color="lime">He has an obsession.</font>

12:04.405 --> 12:07.045
Oh, yes. I used to be one of them.

12:10.285 --> 12:14.164
The book of Genesis tells simply
that Cain killed Abel

12:14.165 --> 12:16.884
and then was condemned
to walk the Earth.

12:16.885 --> 12:19.644
Brother killed brother.
I know that much.

12:19.645 --> 12:21.365
But why?

12:22.365 --> 12:23.884
For jealousy.

12:23.885 --> 12:25.404
For greed.

12:25.405 --> 12:27.884
It was the first act of true evil.

12:27.885 --> 12:30.245
That's why God gave him the mark.

12:31.245 --> 12:33.045
What mark?

12:34.165 --> 12:37.804
God put a mark on Cain
as a punishment,

12:37.805 --> 12:40.644
so everyone would know who he was

12:40.645 --> 12:42.884
and that he was a sinner.

12:42.885 --> 12:44.644
Was it a...

12:44.645 --> 12:46.404
A symbol?

12:46.405 --> 12:47.965
A scar?

12:48.965 --> 12:52.645
Your Highness, I believe
it is more of a curse.

13:06.405 --> 13:11.645
Your Highness, the Bible is meant
to help us, not cause vexation.

13:12.645 --> 13:15.645
I suggest you might achieve peace
through more prayer.

13:16.645 --> 13:18.885
That's a great help. Thanks.

13:30.725 --> 13:33.404
<font color="lime">Jeanne, I said no.
</font><font color="cyan">You don't have power over me.</font>

13:33.405 --> 13:35.884
Yell at the king again,
there'll be trouble.

13:35.885 --> 13:37.564
I won't yell.

13:37.565 --> 13:39.164
Guillaume!

13:39.165 --> 13:40.484
Your Highness.

13:40.485 --> 13:42.644
I've an appointment with the King.

13:42.645 --> 13:45.644
I know, but I was hoping
I might have a word?

13:45.645 --> 13:47.404
Of course, sir.

13:47.405 --> 13:49.165
Do you mind if we...?

13:50.325 --> 13:53.885
You can meet the King, but don't
mention Tristan. I'll deal with it.

13:58.165 --> 14:00.525
You appear somewhat preoccupied too.

14:01.525 --> 14:04.884
It's the arrests in Paris, sir.
Everyone in town is worried.

14:04.885 --> 14:07.924
<font color="lime">We pray the King won't hurt them.
</font>Don't worry about that.

14:07.925 --> 14:09.844
I'll talk to him.

14:09.845 --> 14:11.645
Listen, I've been...

14:12.645 --> 14:15.124
..given an assignation in Paris.

14:15.125 --> 14:17.164
What sort of assignation?

14:17.165 --> 14:18.965
Hard to explain, but...

14:21.165 --> 14:23.645
..I need to know if it's safe.

14:24.885 --> 14:26.445
I'll go with you.

14:27.445 --> 14:29.405
I was hoping you'd say that.

14:43.485 --> 14:46.164
I need to deliver this message
for His Eminence.

14:46.165 --> 14:49.125
You'll find him at the end
of the hall. <font color="cyan">Thank you.</font>

14:57.165 --> 14:59.405
It's from France, Your Eminence.

15:06.165 --> 15:07.644
So...

15:07.645 --> 15:10.404
the esteemed Monsieur Bontemps

15:10.405 --> 15:13.245
fears trouble may be brewing
at Versailles.

15:19.165 --> 15:21.684
Damn kings are more trouble
than they're worth.

15:21.685 --> 15:23.885
Will they ever learn their place?

15:28.645 --> 15:30.685
BELLS RING

15:37.165 --> 15:39.885
Tell the Pope we must speak of this
imminently.

15:42.565 --> 15:44.725
Why is it always the bloody French?

16:09.165 --> 16:12.644
<font color="cyan">I don't wish to trouble you, Sire.
</font>I hope that you won't, Madame.

16:12.645 --> 16:15.645
But I have a predicament
that needs your compassion.

16:28.405 --> 16:31.004
My brother's health is failing.

16:31.005 --> 16:33.644
They fear he'll not survive
the summer.

16:33.645 --> 16:37.925
I seek your permission to travel
to Spain to see him one last time.

16:40.045 --> 16:42.884
Sire, perhaps the Queen
would thrive in the sunshine.

16:42.885 --> 16:45.004
Her pallor is a little wan.

16:45.005 --> 16:48.404
Did she not recently sample
the waters at Vichy?

16:48.405 --> 16:53.164
Yes, but the warmest place
is in the bosom of one's family.

16:53.165 --> 16:56.124
To be separated in times
of need is...

16:56.125 --> 16:57.605
cruel.

17:03.165 --> 17:05.404
You may undertake the journey.

17:05.405 --> 17:07.404
I thank you, my King.

17:07.405 --> 17:10.645
But without spectacle
to ensure your safety.

17:11.885 --> 17:14.325
You are as wise as you are good.

17:23.724 --> 17:26.404
If Charles dies, having the Queen
in Madrid should provide us

17:26.405 --> 17:28.644
with the chance to take
complete control.

17:28.645 --> 17:31.164
That would certainly strengthen
your hand, Sire.

17:31.165 --> 17:33.724
An unlikely ambassador,
but perhaps an effective one.

17:33.725 --> 17:35.405
Your Majesty.

17:47.085 --> 17:48.325
Sorry.

17:57.645 --> 17:59.644
The stitching is exquisite.

17:59.645 --> 18:02.285
Our youngest apprentice did it.

18:03.285 --> 18:04.884
He's called...

18:04.885 --> 18:06.445
Tristan.

18:07.645 --> 18:10.565
Tell him the King spoke highly
of his work.

18:12.885 --> 18:15.165
I would like to, Sire, but...

18:16.645 --> 18:18.605
..he was taken by your men.

18:19.805 --> 18:22.165
A mistake, probably.

18:23.445 --> 18:26.644
He has nothing to do with them
that attacked your minister.

18:26.645 --> 18:29.204
Are you acquainted
with those responsible?

18:29.205 --> 18:31.164
Oh, God, no.

18:31.165 --> 18:32.645
Not at all.

18:33.645 --> 18:35.645
We have no truck with that sort.

18:36.645 --> 18:38.405
But I know Tristan.

18:39.405 --> 18:40.964
He's just...

18:40.965 --> 18:43.205
an innocent child.

18:46.165 --> 18:48.764
Do you think the King made an error?

18:48.765 --> 18:50.005
No.

18:52.365 --> 18:54.445
But perhaps his men did.

18:55.445 --> 18:57.164
To them...

18:57.165 --> 18:59.885
one apprentice just looks like
any other.

19:01.645 --> 19:05.324
How do you know the King hasn't
executed the prisoners already?

19:05.325 --> 19:07.405
We would have heard by now.

19:09.645 --> 19:11.644
If you are right,

19:11.645 --> 19:15.724
what do you think the King
should do with them now?

19:15.725 --> 19:17.565
I hope...

19:18.565 --> 19:20.884
..you release them, Sire,

19:20.885 --> 19:24.244
so the people can see your mercy.

19:24.245 --> 19:27.965
Perhaps I will, when the people
show me respect.

19:29.405 --> 19:31.884
You'll have their respect

19:31.885 --> 19:34.765
if you release the prisoners.

19:53.285 --> 19:56.644
I thank you for your candour
and the gifts.

19:56.645 --> 19:59.005
We receive them with good grace.

20:14.645 --> 20:17.405
Your political instincts
do you credit.

20:18.405 --> 20:21.165
To govern the self is to
govern the world, Sire.

20:23.165 --> 20:25.165
That is the burden of greatness.

20:30.165 --> 20:31.645
Keep watch.

20:42.885 --> 20:44.885
You wanted to see me?

20:45.885 --> 20:48.644
That was quite a bang on the head,
Your Highness.

20:48.645 --> 20:50.645
I was there that night.

20:53.165 --> 20:57.165
You know about the man
with the iron mask?

20:58.205 --> 21:01.565
I buried my wife last week
and I got three children to feed.

21:12.845 --> 21:17.924
Look, I don't know who he is,
but I can tell you where he is.

21:17.925 --> 21:19.724
Take me to him.

21:19.725 --> 21:21.524
No. No way.

21:21.525 --> 21:25.164
<font color="cyan">You don't know who you're dealing
with.</font> Can you show me or not?

21:25.165 --> 21:27.164
This man...

21:27.165 --> 21:30.325
he isn't of this world.

21:31.325 --> 21:33.805
Look, I'm risking my neck
just talking to you.

21:39.925 --> 21:42.165
How hungry are those children?

21:57.605 --> 22:00.644
I was wondering
if you might do me a favour.

22:00.645 --> 22:04.644
My nephew has established
a business in stained glass.

22:04.645 --> 22:08.165
I believe he could become a major
exporter with the King's approval.

22:09.165 --> 22:11.884
Do you think you could request
that for me?

22:11.885 --> 22:13.644
I can do better than that.

22:13.645 --> 22:15.884
Come with me.
We'll ask him together.

22:15.885 --> 22:17.645
Are you sure?

22:18.645 --> 22:20.884
The King is a man of tolerance.

22:20.885 --> 22:23.884
He knows he needs to reach
the hearts of all his subjects,

22:23.885 --> 22:26.004
regardless of their faith.

22:26.005 --> 22:28.644
What if he's not sympathetic?

22:28.645 --> 22:31.164
If anyone can sway his mind,
you can.

22:31.165 --> 22:34.725
The King admires a woman
with wit and intelligence.

22:35.725 --> 22:37.885
PANTING AND GIGGLING

22:39.405 --> 22:42.165
Another time might be
more appropriate.

22:44.405 --> 22:46.165
Of course.

23:10.885 --> 23:12.765
You may leave me.

23:33.165 --> 23:34.885
You know me.

23:37.925 --> 23:40.084
You know that I have women
in my bed.

23:40.085 --> 23:43.245
You've put them there yourself.
You've chosen them for me.

23:44.405 --> 23:46.165
Please, Sire.

23:48.885 --> 23:52.164
I have done what I believed
to be necessary.

23:52.165 --> 23:55.644
So why is it so different when I
choose for myself? Precisely that.

23:55.645 --> 23:58.364
<font color="yellow">You chose them, not I.
</font>You wish to control the King?

23:58.365 --> 24:00.884
I just wish my king
could control himself.

24:00.885 --> 24:03.404
Do you wish to change me? No!

24:03.405 --> 24:06.885
But there has got to be some
measure of self governance.

24:09.445 --> 24:11.764
Do you not wish to harness
your impulses

24:11.765 --> 24:14.644
<font color="yellow">rather than be a slave to them?
</font>You're calling me a slave.

24:14.645 --> 24:17.405
<font color="yellow">Certainly not. Forgive me, Sire.
</font>What must I do?!

24:21.085 --> 24:25.164
What will you do?
I will not give myself in sin,

24:25.165 --> 24:27.924
no matter how much my body
burns for it.

24:27.925 --> 24:30.164
And I will not be diminished
as a man!

24:30.165 --> 24:32.285
But God chose you to be above
all men!

24:41.165 --> 24:44.165
I just want you to achieve
greatness...

24:45.365 --> 24:47.405
..as only you can.

24:58.165 --> 24:59.965
How can I undo this hurt?

25:07.525 --> 25:09.525
Let me touch you.

25:49.885 --> 25:51.605
Pray with me.

26:18.125 --> 26:20.165
SQUAWKING

26:21.405 --> 26:23.644
<font color="cyan">What is it?</font> I don't know.

26:23.645 --> 26:25.404
Something in the trees.

26:25.405 --> 26:27.164
TWIG SNAPS

26:27.165 --> 26:29.644
<font color="cyan">Did you hear that?</font> A fox or a boar.

26:29.645 --> 26:32.404
<font color="cyan">Somebody's following us, I swear.
</font>Coward.

26:32.405 --> 26:34.164
No, I'm afraid.

26:34.165 --> 26:36.165
As should you be.

26:40.645 --> 26:42.165
There.

28:13.645 --> 28:16.885
Tell me who you are
and I will spare your life.

28:17.885 --> 28:20.885
SPEAKS IN OWN LANGUAGE

28:24.085 --> 28:25.324
No!

28:25.325 --> 28:27.165
No! No!

28:28.165 --> 28:29.605
Argh!

28:42.645 --> 28:44.884
It's from the colonies,

28:44.885 --> 28:47.525
with aphrodisiac properties,
apparently.

28:48.525 --> 28:51.404
<font color="lime">Oh, no, thank you.
</font><font color="cyan">You prefer bread and water?</font>

28:51.405 --> 28:53.164
Me too.

28:53.165 --> 28:55.404
Provided the bread stays as bread

28:55.405 --> 28:58.164
and doesn't mysteriously
turn into flesh.

28:58.165 --> 28:59.885
You've been studying.

29:00.885 --> 29:03.365
<font color="cyan">I've developed an interest.</font> Yes.

29:06.405 --> 29:08.644
But you'd have to convert

29:08.645 --> 29:12.164
if you wish to get your hands
on my extensive fortune.

29:12.165 --> 29:13.884
No need to convert.

29:13.885 --> 29:16.325
I'm as proficient with women
as I am with men.

29:24.165 --> 29:25.645
Your Highness.

29:27.165 --> 29:28.844
You're bleeding.

29:28.845 --> 29:30.085
What?

29:32.165 --> 29:33.885
No, it's nothing.

30:26.165 --> 30:29.165
Bad news, my friend.
You must be moved again.

30:31.405 --> 30:33.645
Your safety is my duty.

30:44.645 --> 30:46.444
What did they say?

30:46.445 --> 30:48.165
Tristan's alive.

30:49.165 --> 30:51.084
That's all I know.

30:51.085 --> 30:53.885
<font color="cyan">Did you speak to the King's brother?
</font><font color="lime">I did my best.</font>

30:54.885 --> 30:56.644
He can't promise anything.

30:56.645 --> 30:59.164
That's it?
After everything we've done?

30:59.165 --> 31:02.164
I have no doubt
the King will be merciful.

31:02.165 --> 31:06.244
<font color="lime">You just have to be calm and wait.
</font><font color="cyan">Calm? How can I be calm?!</font>

31:06.245 --> 31:09.645
He's not just my son.
He belongs to all of us.

31:11.805 --> 31:14.525
Well, if you won't do anything,
I will.

31:15.525 --> 31:17.165
I'll find a way.

31:31.885 --> 31:34.884
<font color="lime">Are you lost?</font> It would seem so.

31:34.885 --> 31:37.845
I seek the Princess Palatine?

31:38.845 --> 31:40.884
<font color="lime">Then your quest is over.</font> Oh.

31:40.885 --> 31:43.605
I am the Duc de Blaye.

31:44.885 --> 31:47.405
<font color="lime">Remind me.</font> I paint.

31:48.405 --> 31:49.924
Madame de Montespan

31:49.925 --> 31:52.444
said the Princess would
appreciate a portrait.

31:52.445 --> 31:56.644
Well, we're not all as vain as her.
That's not really my idea of fun.

31:56.645 --> 32:00.124
But I have brought samples.
She assured me you would like them.

32:00.125 --> 32:03.205
Please. I've come all the way
from Villarceaux.

32:05.165 --> 32:06.645
Villarceaux?

32:07.645 --> 32:09.165
Really?

32:11.285 --> 32:12.885
Do come in.

32:15.445 --> 32:18.405
I hope they're to your liking.

32:22.885 --> 32:27.164
Tell me, at Villarceaux, were you
familiar with this young woman?

32:27.165 --> 32:28.684
Oh!

32:28.685 --> 32:31.965
Young Francoise was known to
all the men at the chateau.

32:32.965 --> 32:37.964
Though never the most beautiful,
she had a particular allure,

32:37.965 --> 32:41.165
like a spirit that only rises
in moonlight.

32:43.325 --> 32:45.924
She was a favourite subject.

32:45.925 --> 32:48.404
Some of my finest brushwork.

32:48.405 --> 32:50.644
My God. Madame de Maintenon.

32:50.645 --> 32:54.404
I hope Her Highness
will consider a commission.

32:54.405 --> 32:58.164
I think you should pack these away
and go back to the country quickly.

32:58.165 --> 33:00.164
Have I offended you?

33:00.165 --> 33:01.885
No, it's just...

33:02.885 --> 33:05.404
..better you leave now
for all our sakes.

33:05.405 --> 33:07.285
KNOCK ON DOOR

33:08.285 --> 33:11.644
I thought you should know
the Queen leaves imminently.

33:11.645 --> 33:14.404
Get him out of here
and take the back stairs.

33:14.405 --> 33:16.644
Do I have the air of a servant?

33:16.645 --> 33:19.404
I'm trusting you with this.
He's a libertine.

33:19.405 --> 33:21.884
Maintenon would not appreciate
his presence.

33:21.885 --> 33:25.165
<font color="cyan">Sounds like my kind of person.
</font>Do not let him out of your sight.

33:27.965 --> 33:29.885
Did I just see a nipple?

33:36.885 --> 33:39.485
Tell them to hurry.
I don't wish to ride in the dark.

33:40.485 --> 33:42.444
I came to say my good-byes.

33:42.445 --> 33:44.164
Why?

33:44.165 --> 33:46.645
I'll be back before Ascension.

33:47.645 --> 33:49.684
I wanted to wish you well.

33:49.685 --> 33:52.164
I know it will be hard.
Your poor brother.

33:52.165 --> 33:54.644
But it'll be nice to see
the Spanish sun again.

33:54.645 --> 33:57.564
<font color="lime">I wish I could accompany you.
</font><font color="cyan">Thank you for your friendship.</font>

33:57.565 --> 33:59.644
You made some of my time here
bearable.

33:59.645 --> 34:01.284
I will always remember it.

34:01.285 --> 34:02.685
Madame. >

34:36.925 --> 34:41.885
RECITES IN LATIN

34:54.445 --> 34:55.885
Amen.

35:07.125 --> 35:11.525
To send so senior a cleric
as messenger boy...

35:13.405 --> 35:16.804
..don't you see that
as disrespectful to the Church?

35:16.805 --> 35:18.644
On the contrary.

35:18.645 --> 35:22.165
The King sent me as a demonstration
of his esteem.

35:24.685 --> 35:29.445
That would suggest Louis must have
a request of some significance.

35:32.205 --> 35:35.164
Not a request, Your Grace.

35:35.165 --> 35:37.885
He is simply seeking
the Pope's approval.

35:38.885 --> 35:40.405
For what?

35:41.405 --> 35:44.644
He would like to point out
that Emperor Leopold

35:44.645 --> 35:48.165
has shown his true weakness
in losing the war.

35:49.165 --> 35:52.884
The war in which the Pope
supported him.

35:52.885 --> 35:54.804
Quite.

35:54.805 --> 35:56.644
But following his victory,

35:56.645 --> 36:00.404
the King of France has negotiated
a more generous deal

36:00.405 --> 36:01.884
regarding Spain.

36:01.885 --> 36:05.645
On the death of King Charles,
Louis wishes to take...

36:06.645 --> 36:09.205
..80% of Spain and its territories.

36:10.205 --> 36:11.965
HE LAUGHS

36:13.485 --> 36:17.325
To control Spain would be audacious,
even for Louis.

36:18.645 --> 36:19.885
Indeed.

36:20.885 --> 36:24.644
That is why the king humbly asks
that His Holiness, the Pope,

36:24.645 --> 36:28.645
will give his blessing to France
as a true Catholic nation.

36:31.765 --> 36:35.164
Our feeling is that the King
could do with some permanent

36:35.165 --> 36:37.885
presence from the Vatican
at his court.

36:40.645 --> 36:43.565
That is my role, Your Grace.

36:46.405 --> 36:51.164
We fear things may become
more challenging for Louis

36:51.165 --> 36:52.845
in the coming days.

36:55.165 --> 36:57.165
And this is our way of helping.

37:09.965 --> 37:12.404
So it's not actually a question

37:12.405 --> 37:15.044
of how you approach the gentleman.

37:15.045 --> 37:16.644
No.

37:16.645 --> 37:19.885
It's about how you make yourself
available to him.

37:49.325 --> 37:52.684
Yes, but should I ever
look at him directly?

37:52.685 --> 37:54.405
Never... No.

37:55.405 --> 37:57.885
That would be telling him
that you're equal.

38:12.165 --> 38:13.645
Stop!

38:16.565 --> 38:18.165
Whoa.

38:32.165 --> 38:35.405
It's getting late.
We should be heading back.

38:57.885 --> 38:59.844
I thought you had left.

38:59.845 --> 39:01.404
I am unwell.

39:01.405 --> 39:05.165
Suddenly the journey seemed more
taxing than I could stomach.

39:13.885 --> 39:15.884
Do you find it strange?

39:15.885 --> 39:19.165
Aren't all women adept
at changing their minds?

39:21.085 --> 39:22.885
She seemed so sure.

39:32.925 --> 39:35.404
Now, tell us some more
of Madame de Maintenon.

39:35.405 --> 39:37.165
Ah, Francoise!

39:38.165 --> 39:39.644
One word.

39:39.645 --> 39:41.284
Triangular.

39:41.285 --> 39:43.085
LAUGHTER

39:47.005 --> 39:50.404
<font color="lime">Why is he here?
</font><font color="cyan">A bumpkin is always welcome.</font>

39:50.405 --> 39:54.164
But Montespan sent him here to
destroy Maintenon's reputation.

39:54.165 --> 39:57.245
Which serves her right
for what she did to you.

40:06.245 --> 40:07.645
Francoise...

40:08.645 --> 40:12.164
<font color="yellow">..is consort to the king?
</font><font color="cyan">I know. Hard to believe.</font>

40:12.165 --> 40:14.164
How fortunes rise and fall.

40:14.165 --> 40:16.284
I... I have been...

40:16.285 --> 40:17.884
deceived.

40:17.885 --> 40:21.085
I will have no part of your plan,
sir.

40:24.925 --> 40:27.045
To what do we owe this mirth?

40:32.965 --> 40:35.884
Something unfit for
the royal presence, Sire.

40:35.885 --> 40:38.085
I shall destroy it.

41:05.165 --> 41:07.405
Which one of you painted this?

41:11.885 --> 41:15.284
Are you to blame for
this abomination? Hm?

41:15.285 --> 41:17.164
You wish to humiliate Madame?

41:17.165 --> 41:19.645
The fault is not theirs, Sire.

41:26.565 --> 41:28.405
I was troubled.

41:29.405 --> 41:31.405
I had lost my husband.

41:33.765 --> 41:35.645
I was innocent and alone.

41:37.405 --> 41:39.165
I had nowhere to go.

41:40.165 --> 41:41.885
No-one to turn to.

41:43.125 --> 41:46.205
And Villarceaux offered opportunity.

41:49.645 --> 41:51.645
But it was a new Gomorrah.

41:53.645 --> 41:55.645
To thrive, one had to...

41:58.165 --> 41:59.885
To comply.

42:08.645 --> 42:10.165
I needed money.

42:11.405 --> 42:13.165
I needed protection.

42:15.405 --> 42:17.885
<font color="yellow">So I...</font> So you became a whore.

42:24.405 --> 42:27.205
I committed sins that I regret.

42:29.885 --> 42:32.644
But I no more wanted those paintings

42:32.645 --> 42:35.645
than I ever wanted to hurt my king.

42:39.165 --> 42:41.405
Do you understand me, Sire?

42:45.165 --> 42:46.645
No.

42:48.165 --> 42:49.885
No, I do not.

42:52.885 --> 42:54.645
You lied to me.

42:56.165 --> 42:59.645
For God's sake, I believed in you.

43:01.405 --> 43:03.164
Have I no judgment?

43:03.165 --> 43:04.644
Am I a fool?

43:04.645 --> 43:06.404
You spoke to me.

43:06.405 --> 43:08.884
You touched my heart
like never before.

43:08.885 --> 43:11.725
You looked me in the eye
and you promised me.

43:15.885 --> 43:18.164
I know I have humiliated you.

43:18.165 --> 43:19.884
I'm the King!

43:19.885 --> 43:22.165
I cannot be humiliated.

43:26.165 --> 43:27.685
I feel...

43:37.725 --> 43:41.725
You have betrayed me
in the worst possible way.

43:43.405 --> 43:44.885
This life...

43:45.885 --> 43:48.404
That life was never my choice.

43:48.405 --> 43:50.884
But it was your choice
not to tell me.

43:50.885 --> 43:54.164
To make me think that the world
contained someone...

43:54.165 --> 43:55.884
someone better.

43:55.885 --> 43:57.885
Something we could...

43:59.165 --> 44:02.925
Some... Someone to whom
we could aspire.

44:06.165 --> 44:10.404
<font color="yellow">I ask forgiveness from God every
day.</font> Enough of the Lord's word!

44:10.405 --> 44:12.164
I'm talking about us.

44:12.165 --> 44:15.164
Me and you!
Being honest with each other.

44:15.165 --> 44:16.645
Utterly!

44:22.405 --> 44:23.885
So...

44:28.885 --> 44:31.405
..where do we turn to now, hm?

44:35.405 --> 44:37.165
I should leave you.

44:38.965 --> 44:41.405
I will withdraw from this world.

44:43.165 --> 44:45.165
Take myself from your sight.

44:48.645 --> 44:50.885
I must atone for my sins.

44:52.645 --> 44:55.525
Nothing can be atoned
for what you've done to me.

44:58.325 --> 44:59.885
Nothing.

45:03.165 --> 45:05.645
Then I will pray for your mercy,
Sire.

45:08.405 --> 45:10.405
There can be none.

45:54.125 --> 45:56.165
HE SOBS

46:13.165 --> 46:14.925
LOUD GRUNT

46:19.645 --> 46:21.164
Sire?

46:21.165 --> 46:24.044
Order my horse to be prepared.
I want to go riding.

46:24.045 --> 46:27.404
But, Sire, the stable hands
will still be asleep.

46:27.405 --> 46:29.165
Then wake them up.

46:30.165 --> 46:32.244
Of course, Sire.

46:32.245 --> 46:33.884
And wake Lorraine up.

46:33.885 --> 46:37.045
I want him to organise a party,
something out of the ordinary.

46:50.645 --> 46:53.084
It's a beautiful day for a ride,
Sire.

46:53.085 --> 46:54.645
If you say so.

46:55.965 --> 46:57.644
This way!

46:57.645 --> 46:59.724
But, Sire, I see no track!

46:59.725 --> 47:01.644
Then we should make one!

47:01.645 --> 47:03.285
Come on!

47:08.165 --> 47:09.405
Ya!

47:15.645 --> 47:17.405
Come on! Ya!

47:18.885 --> 47:20.645
Sire!

47:21.885 --> 47:24.165
Come on! Ya! Ya!

47:28.165 --> 47:29.645
Sire!

47:36.165 --> 47:38.205
HORSE NEIGHS

47:51.645 --> 47:53.564
Are you injured, Sire?

47:53.565 --> 47:55.565
He's in pain.

47:57.805 --> 48:00.404
Perhaps they can reset it.

48:00.405 --> 48:02.165
Give me a pistol.

48:38.165 --> 48:40.164
'My dearest Leopold,

48:40.165 --> 48:43.644
'I couldn't go through with it,
my darling.

48:43.645 --> 48:45.885
'Please forgive me.

48:47.885 --> 48:50.405
'I can only share with you
my regret...

48:51.885 --> 48:54.165
'..my heartfelt apology...

48:55.405 --> 48:57.405
'..and my warmest love.'

49:03.485 --> 49:05.524
HE WHISTLES

49:05.525 --> 49:09.884
Let us sample the medicine
of the Aztecs,

49:09.885 --> 49:13.165
see what the heathens
know that we do not.

49:14.165 --> 49:16.204
Ladies and gentlemen,

49:16.205 --> 49:19.644
this nectar of chocolate

49:19.645 --> 49:23.404
is guaranteed to swell the senses

49:23.405 --> 49:25.525
and boost the libido.

49:26.525 --> 49:27.885
Enjoy.

49:33.405 --> 49:36.645
<font color="lime">Can you not plea for his mercy?
</font><font color="cyan">I did.</font>

49:37.645 --> 49:40.404
This is my decision.
I have chosen to go.

49:40.405 --> 49:42.364
But your life is here.

49:42.365 --> 49:45.404
<font color="cyan">I have no choice.
</font><font color="lime">You always have a choice.</font>

49:45.405 --> 49:48.644
<font color="lime">That's what God gave us.
</font><font color="cyan">This is what I must do.</font>

49:48.645 --> 49:51.645
I can't pretend to understand you,
Francoise.

49:52.645 --> 49:55.885
You are harder on yourself
than the Lord would ever be.

49:59.325 --> 50:01.165
Goodbye, my dear friend.

50:31.325 --> 50:33.164
Right, Let's go.

50:33.165 --> 50:35.884
Hold on, hold on.
It's too dangerous.

50:35.885 --> 50:37.404
I don't care.

50:37.405 --> 50:40.165
<font color="cyan">We're not going back now.
</font><font color="yellow">Have you lost your mind?</font>

50:58.485 --> 51:00.404
Hurry, hurry. Get it ready.

51:00.405 --> 51:02.165
Is their venison ready?

51:09.405 --> 51:11.165
Where the hell is it?

51:26.885 --> 51:28.645
It's that bastard.

51:57.885 --> 51:59.765
Your hand is shaking.

52:00.765 --> 52:02.484
Is it?

52:02.485 --> 52:04.645
Surely I do not make you quake.

52:07.405 --> 52:08.885
Sire...

52:10.165 --> 52:11.885
..I deceived you.

52:15.165 --> 52:19.084
It was Madame de Montespan who sent
De Blaye here with the painting.

52:19.085 --> 52:22.164
I should have sent him away
the moment he arrived,

52:22.165 --> 52:23.645
but I didn't.

52:24.645 --> 52:26.404
I was at fault, Sire.

52:26.405 --> 52:29.445
There's always call for sturdy
women in the colonies.

52:36.405 --> 52:38.405
You're close to the Queen.

52:39.405 --> 52:41.164
Yes, I suppose I am.

52:41.165 --> 52:43.404
Why did she change her plans?

52:43.405 --> 52:45.644
I... I don't know.

52:45.645 --> 52:47.364
Find out.

52:47.365 --> 52:49.004
Become closer.

52:49.005 --> 52:51.885
Reassure me that all is well
in her world.

53:04.205 --> 53:06.444
It appears we've been let down.

53:06.445 --> 53:09.164
If the Queen can't be trusted,
we must find another way

53:09.165 --> 53:11.724
to undermine Louis's claim
to the Spanish Empire.

53:11.725 --> 53:14.645
Send this message to our spy
at his court.

53:15.605 --> 53:18.164
'Our plan to marry Charles
has failed.

53:18.165 --> 53:21.164
'It's time for the more
radical solution.

53:21.165 --> 53:24.165
'We must act swiftly
and without remorse.

53:25.165 --> 53:28.165
'I await the news
that the Queen is dead.'
