15:23.840 --> 15:26.509
time I've gone to do something

15:26.551 --> 15:28.302
with the boys,

15:26.551 --> 15:28.302
you've already done it.

15:28.344 --> 15:29.804
And I know that

15:28.344 --> 15:29.804
you only want to help

15:29.846 --> 15:33.307
but my time

15:29.846 --> 15:33.307
with them is really precious.

15:33.349 --> 15:36.102
I mean, they're only

15:33.349 --> 15:36.102
this age for so long.

15:36.143 --> 15:38.312
Don't I know it.

15:38.354 --> 15:41.524
[sighs]

15:38.354 --> 15:41.524
I'm sorry, Becky.

15:41.566 --> 15:42.734
I guess when Michelle told me

15:42.776 --> 15:44.569
that she was too old

15:42.776 --> 15:44.569
to ride Quacky

15:44.611 --> 15:48.239
I realized that my last, little

15:44.611 --> 15:48.239
duck rider had left the pond.

15:49.198 --> 15:50.533
Oh, Danny.

15:51.868 --> 15:54.621
I miss having babies around.

15:54.662 --> 15:56.748
So, what I've been thinking is

15:56.790 --> 15:58.207
can I have one of yours?

15:58.249 --> 16:00.293
Danny.

16:00.334 --> 16:03.003
Look, I'm sorry

16:00.334 --> 16:03.003
I'll stay out of your way.

16:03.045 --> 16:05.256
Oh, no, you're not in the way.

16:05.298 --> 16:06.633
Look, the boys

16:05.298 --> 16:06.633
love being with you.

16:06.674 --> 16:07.717
[babbling]

16:07.759 --> 16:10.094
- Baboo.

16:07.759 --> 16:10.094
- Uncle Danny's fun.

16:10.136 --> 16:12.764
You know what can do?

16:12.806 --> 16:15.349
We'll set aside some

16:12.806 --> 16:15.349
special Uncle Danny time

16:15.391 --> 16:17.560
so you guys can be together.

16:17.602 --> 16:20.020
- Really?

16:17.602 --> 16:20.020
- Yeah.

16:20.062 --> 16:21.606
How's that sound,

16:20.062 --> 16:21.606
guys, huh?

16:21.648 --> 16:24.609
You like that idea?

16:25.860 --> 16:27.027
Thanks, Becky.

16:27.069 --> 16:28.070
Yes, yes, mommy will get it.

16:28.112 --> 16:29.739
Oh, oh, oh..

16:33.075 --> 16:34.410
Hi, peanut.

16:36.955 --> 16:40.291
Oh, I get it.

16:40.333 --> 16:41.584
You're not talking to us.

16:43.586 --> 16:45.797
Michelle, are you

16:43.586 --> 16:45.797
not talking to us?

16:49.049 --> 16:52.052
Yeah, she's not talking to us.

16:52.094 --> 16:54.138
Alright, all that are ticked off

16:54.180 --> 16:56.307
at Uncle Jesse

16:54.180 --> 16:56.307
and Joey say aye.

16:56.349 --> 16:58.935
Aye!

16:58.977 --> 17:01.061
You tricked me.

17:01.938 --> 17:04.398
I get it, Michelle.

17:04.440 --> 17:07.026
You think we're being

17:04.440 --> 17:07.026
unfair, don't you?

17:07.067 --> 17:08.277
Right.

17:08.319 --> 17:10.029
Well, we think

17:08.319 --> 17:10.029
you're being unfair.

17:10.070 --> 17:13.783
Michelle, everyone in that

17:10.070 --> 17:13.783
play is working very hard.

17:13.825 --> 17:15.702
Now, if we don't have

17:13.825 --> 17:15.702
a Statue of Liberty

17:15.743 --> 17:17.203
you're letting all

17:15.743 --> 17:17.203
the other kids down.

17:17.244 --> 17:18.287
Is that what you want?

17:18.329 --> 17:21.374
No, I want to be

17:18.329 --> 17:21.374
Yankee Doodle

17:21.415 --> 17:24.752
'cause Stephanie and D.J.

17:21.415 --> 17:24.752
were Yankee Doodle

17:24.794 --> 17:27.463
and I want to be

17:24.794 --> 17:27.463
Yankee Doodle, too.

17:27.505 --> 17:30.842
Well, Michelle, you don't always

17:27.505 --> 17:30.842
get what you want in life.

17:30.884 --> 17:33.260
Hey, when I was little boy,

17:30.884 --> 17:33.260
I wanted to be Fred Flintstone

17:33.302 --> 17:35.722
but heck,

17:33.302 --> 17:35.722
I had too many toes.

17:38.098 --> 17:40.393
Excuse me, Michelle.

17:43.771 --> 17:44.814
Now, Michelle,

17:43.771 --> 17:44.814
this whole thing

17:44.856 --> 17:46.399
it's, it's like

17:44.856 --> 17:46.399
being in a band.

17:46.440 --> 17:48.735
I mean, not everyone

17:46.440 --> 17:48.735
can be the lead singer.

17:48.776 --> 17:50.319
- You are.

17:48.776 --> 17:50.319
- 'Yes.'

17:50.361 --> 17:53.197
But I'm no more important

17:50.361 --> 17:53.197
than the bass player.

17:53.239 --> 17:54.991
What's his name?

17:55.033 --> 17:58.285
Kid with the long, curly hair.

17:55.033 --> 17:58.285
Larry or Lenny or something.

17:58.327 --> 18:00.997
Michelle, excuse me.

18:04.876 --> 18:07.670
What Jesse isn't

18:04.876 --> 18:07.670
quite saying is..

18:07.712 --> 18:10.757
...you're part of a team and

18:07.712 --> 18:10.757
everyone has to do their share.

18:10.798 --> 18:14.761
That's right, and, uh, my band

18:10.798 --> 18:14.761
wouldn't sound as good without..

18:14.802 --> 18:16.512
What's the kid's name?

18:14.802 --> 18:16.512
What is his name?

18:16.554 --> 18:18.305
The long-haired guy.

18:18.347 --> 18:21.559
The point is, Michelle, a lot

18:18.347 --> 18:21.559
of people are counting on you.

18:21.601 --> 18:23.436
That's right, so,

18:21.601 --> 18:23.436
we want you to go out there

18:23.477 --> 18:26.064
and we want you to be the<i> best</i>

18:23.477 --> 18:26.064
Statue of Liberty you could be.

18:26.105 --> 18:28.315
-<i> Capisce?</i>

18:26.105 --> 18:28.315
-<i> Capisce.</i>

18:28.357 --> 18:29.567
And his name is Lanny.

18:29.609 --> 18:30.777
Lanny!

[instrumental music]

18:40.244 --> 18:41.454
Steve, you came.

18:41.495 --> 18:43.664
Yeah. I'm sorry

18:41.495 --> 18:43.664
I got mad the other day.

18:43.706 --> 18:45.291
No, it was my fault.

18:45.332 --> 18:48.335
Let's never fight again.

18:48.377 --> 18:51.005
I've never felt closer

18:48.377 --> 18:51.005
to you than I do right now.

18:51.047 --> 18:52.465
Neither have I.

18:54.092 --> 18:55.927
Steve, I'll never

18:54.092 --> 18:55.927
make another decision

18:55.969 --> 18:58.930
without asking you first.

18:58.972 --> 19:02.182
Uh, switch seats with my dad..

19:02.224 --> 19:03.768
...if it's okay with you.

19:03.810 --> 19:05.770
Yeah, it's fine.

19:08.106 --> 19:09.440
Oh.

19:20.451 --> 19:22.328
Okay, you're on. You're on.

19:23.997 --> 19:25.957
Greetings, fellow Americans.

19:25.999 --> 19:28.167
I am the father

19:25.999 --> 19:28.167

19:49.438 --> 19:52.108
Here, psst! Psst!

19:58.739 --> 20:01.617
I think it's going pretty well.

20:03.285 --> 20:05.287
Goodbye, Paul Revere.

20:05.329 --> 20:07.456
Thanks for the warning.

20:07.498 --> 20:11.627

20:22.304 --> 20:24.891
[music continues]

20:27.601 --> 20:29.520
Excuse me.

20:29.562 --> 20:31.438
Hold this, Abe.

20:32.940 --> 20:34.067
Just be a moment.

20:34.108 --> 20:37.904
Talk amongst yourselves.

20:37.945 --> 20:40.114
What's going on here? It's

20:37.945 --> 20:40.114
his time for the big finale.

20:40.156 --> 20:42.616
He's frozen! The show's over.

20:40.156 --> 20:42.616
It's a total choke-job!

20:42.658 --> 20:45.536
Steph, Steph,

20:42.658 --> 20:45.536
you're not helping, okay?

20:45.578 --> 20:48.748
Hey, Derrick, come on,

20:45.578 --> 20:48.748
you're gonna be great out there.

20:48.789 --> 20:50.917
No. I can't do this.

20:53.377 --> 20:55.796
Let me talk to him.

20:55.838 --> 20:59.759
Derrick, do you know how long

20:55.838 --> 20:59.759
I've been holding up my arm?

20:59.800 --> 21:02.428
Michelle, I'm too scared

20:59.800 --> 21:02.428
to go out there.

21:02.469 --> 21:05.472
You be Yankee Doodle.

21:02.469 --> 21:05.472
You're good.

21:05.514 --> 21:09.018
Yes, that's true..

21:09.060 --> 21:11.311
...but you're great.

21:11.353 --> 21:12.939
Right now I'm sick.

21:12.980 --> 21:16.275
But we're all on

21:12.980 --> 21:16.275
the same team. We need you.

21:16.943 --> 21:17.944
You do?

21:17.985 --> 21:20.238
Totally.

21:20.279 --> 21:24.158
Now, go out there and be the

21:20.279 --> 21:24.158
best Yankee Doodle you can be.

21:27.661 --> 21:30.248
Okay, here I go.

21:32.291 --> 21:34.877
You're not moving.

21:34.919 --> 21:36.378
Give me a push.
