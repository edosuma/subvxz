00:00.120 --> 00:03.840
Michael Sharp. He just cleared
customs in Stansted an hour ago.

00:03.920 --> 00:07.520
The building that Sharp just went
into, it's a safety deposit house.

00:10.480 --> 00:15.200
Picked him on their cam heading into
Bank Station, and then vanished.

00:16.200 --> 00:17.560
Well, this isn't good.

00:17.640 --> 00:19.840
The fourth man. Call himself Ray.

00:19.920 --> 00:23.640
He had that... skin disease when skin
bleaches.

00:25.040 --> 00:29.040
Michael Sharp, I'm arresting you on
suspicion of armed robbery.

00:31.000 --> 00:37.074

00:42.400 --> 00:45.600
Listen, look, there's three of us in
this marriage, all right.

00:45.680 --> 00:48.800
You can't just expect me to leave my
wife and come and see you.

00:50.160 --> 00:53.200
We're supposed to be adults.
If you've got something to say

00:53.280 --> 00:55.240
you can say it over the phone.

00:55.320 --> 00:57.720
'Hello? Hello?

00:57.800 --> 00:59.760
Aw, come on, don't go all silent
on me.'

00:59.880 --> 01:02.280
I'm not going silent on you,
I'm just concentrating.

01:02.360 --> 01:04.400
I'm actually looking for sharp clues
in the BMW.

01:04.480 --> 01:07.400
Listen, you sounded silent to me.

01:07.480 --> 01:11.960
Anyway, look, I've gotta go. Arjana's
gonna be wondering where I am.

01:12.040 --> 01:14.000
See you later.

01:14.080 --> 01:17.600
It's the last one, Pike. Any more
and they'll notice.

01:17.680 --> 01:19.640
Who are they gonna tell? Police?

01:35.720 --> 01:37.800
Why so serious?

01:37.880 --> 01:41.840
To become partner I need that.

01:41.920 --> 01:46.320
Or bring in meaningful clients to
show I'm worth my partnership.

01:48.080 --> 01:50.760
I thought this was about making
money, not giving it to them.

01:50.840 --> 01:54.520
It is, eventually, but this is what
they call a buy in.

01:54.600 --> 01:56.680
It's what I called a fucking liberty.

01:56.760 --> 02:01.920
Maybe I'm better off as
a mother to my two crazy kids.

02:02.000 --> 02:04.080
Three now.

02:04.160 --> 02:06.640
But don't worry, I'll sell Bishop
down at the docks.

02:06.720 --> 02:09.720
Great. That's a fiver right there.

02:11.080 --> 02:15.080
I'm serious. Where are we gonna find
that sort of money?

02:15.160 --> 02:19.240
Baby... when have you ever not got
what you wanted?

02:19.320 --> 02:21.880
I've got you.

02:21.960 --> 02:23.920
Yeah.

02:24.000 --> 02:26.440
So... what are you saying?

02:26.520 --> 02:29.440
come on.

02:33.640 --> 02:35.833
Ow, what is that?
Don't make out like

02:35.846 --> 02:37.760
you ain't felt a big one before.

02:37.840 --> 02:41.120
It's a fucking laptop sticking at my
side.

02:41.200 --> 02:45.520
You ready? Jump on.

02:54.360 --> 02:57.680
I need the dashboard cam of the BMW.
It's down in the garage, mate.

02:57.760 --> 03:00.320
The very one that you smashed to
pieces?

03:00.400 --> 03:02.880
The very one that Pike smashed to
pieces, yes.

03:06.320 --> 03:09.200
Denied? I don't like that at all.

04:07.344 --> 04:09.504
Why you gotta drive so mad? Shut up.

04:09.584 --> 04:11.784
What do you think 'access denied'
means?

04:11.864 --> 04:14.064
It means we're no longer on the
case.

04:14.144 --> 04:17.303
Cos our car got smashed? You forgot
your suspect getting killed

04:17.384 --> 04:20.064
in that sentence, Pike. So you're
just gonna lie down and take it?

04:20.144 --> 04:23.624
Fucking Mam to you, and please,
spare me with your cheap jibes.

04:23.704 --> 04:25.744
You had Sharp in your custody and
now he's dead.

04:25.824 --> 04:28.024
Who's that down to?
The mug who T-boned us.

04:28.104 --> 04:30.704
Don't pull that one on me. Who wants
to take responsibility

04:30.784 --> 04:32.273
for their actions here?
Who wants to

04:32.286 --> 04:33.704
admit they lost a
valuable suspect

04:33.784 --> 04:35.944
while in their custody?

04:36.024 --> 04:38.504
Boys, you know I've got a soft spot
for you, but sometimes

04:38.584 --> 04:41.024
you act like a pair of petulant
little shits.

04:41.104 --> 04:43.744
We're off the Sharp case due to
negligence.

04:43.824 --> 04:47.024
Own it if you like. Robbery squad
have taken over

04:47.104 --> 04:49.544
cos it was a robbery
that drew Sharp out.

04:49.624 --> 04:52.864
Now, I'm off to deal with some other
fucking bottom feeders

04:52.944 --> 04:55.104
because that's what we do for
a living.

04:58.704 --> 05:01.104
Man, I'm not trying to be more
paranoid than I usually am

05:01.184 --> 05:03.304
but something's not right.
I can feel it.

05:03.384 --> 05:06.744
It makes no sense. Bruv, we could've
been killed.

05:06.824 --> 05:09.904
So why weren't we? I tell you what,
I saw the arm that came through

05:09.984 --> 05:12.504
the window and killed Sharp. It had
that polka dot, panda

05:12.584 --> 05:14.944
vitiligo shit. Barton was telling
the truth.

05:15.024 --> 05:17.424
Barton was linked to the robbery
as well.

05:18.664 --> 05:20.704
Look, let's just go to the prison,

05:20.784 --> 05:23.424
put it on him. I would but you know
you have to get clearance

05:23.504 --> 05:25.464
from Tanner to see a Category 8
prisoner.

05:25.544 --> 05:28.424
We don't get Tanner on side,
we don't get to see Barton.

05:29.464 --> 05:31.944
Can't lie, when she's angry, there's
something about her

05:32.024 --> 05:34.864
which I quite like. Mm-mm.
No, don't go there.

05:34.944 --> 05:37.144
You're lonely. Mm.

05:37.224 --> 05:40.264
What the fuck did Sharp have to say
that was so important?

05:40.344 --> 05:42.704
Do you know what, this stays low.

05:42.784 --> 05:45.424
No-one else knows, but we don't stop.

05:45.504 --> 05:47.464
When do we ever?

05:50.504 --> 05:52.824
So we've got a name but no face.

05:52.904 --> 05:56.584
Jason Woods runs gangs,
manufacturing and serving spice,

05:56.664 --> 05:59.824
ketamine, methamphetamine and
marijuana.

05:59.904 --> 06:02.024
Woods does his business from a pub
in Silvertown,

06:02.104 --> 06:03.570
but he never does
the drugs, which is

06:03.583 --> 06:04.944
why we don't have
a visual of him,

06:05.024 --> 06:07.064
cos the slippery fucker's never been
arrested.

06:07.144 --> 06:10.304
We're hunting puff dealers? Don't be
boring, you're better than that.

06:10.384 --> 06:13.664
Just doing my job. Hold on, we're
getting dumped off the Sharp case

06:13.744 --> 06:16.664
to look for plants? We organise
crime. Not gardeners.

06:16.744 --> 06:20.264
There's a reason with the Sharp
case. Involves a pair of clowns.

06:20.344 --> 06:21.664
Shut your mouth. Fuck off.

06:21.744 --> 06:24.464
Oi, easy. Tanner, you got a minute,
please?

06:24.544 --> 06:28.984
Always, sir. Mam, this is one of the
NCA's organised crime

06:29.064 --> 06:32.544
command teams. You obviously know
that reprobate.

06:34.744 --> 06:37.984
Very good. Keep up the good work.
Will do. Shall we?

06:40.944 --> 06:43.984
Right, ID Woods and stick a bullet
in his operation.

06:44.064 --> 06:46.064
Priority, find out where they make
these drugs,

06:46.144 --> 06:48.904
and treat it like any other case,
all of you.

06:53.824 --> 06:56.504
How are you getting on?

06:56.584 --> 06:58.544
How am I getting on? This is some
sort of joke.

06:58.624 --> 07:00.904
I don't know - No, I meant you.

07:00.984 --> 07:02.944
Oh.

07:06.224 --> 07:08.384
Yeah, I'm all right. Thank you.

07:08.464 --> 07:10.424
Good.

07:23.384 --> 07:25.424
I thought Nell looked nice today.

07:25.504 --> 07:28.544
It's like she made some extra effort
for something.

07:28.624 --> 07:31.864
Shush your mouth, please, please.
Or maybe someone.

07:31.944 --> 07:34.704
Just leave it. Honestly,
I don't care how she looks.

07:34.784 --> 07:37.384
She can dress how she likes.
All right.

07:37.464 --> 07:39.464
I'm just saying, innit.
She looked good.

07:39.544 --> 07:42.224
Maybe. Dunno. All right.

07:43.744 --> 07:46.384
Bruv, these kids look the same age as
my Annie.

07:46.464 --> 07:50.104
Yeah, man. I mean, just look at
them, bruv.

07:50.184 --> 07:53.104
Let's go down and kick up these
youths and put an end to this.

07:53.184 --> 07:55.144
Yeah, man. Good idea, Officer Bishop.

07:55.224 --> 07:57.006
You saying we should
put an end to

07:57.019 --> 07:58.864
this boring
surveillance operation?

07:58.944 --> 08:00.944
Why are you talking like that, man?

08:01.024 --> 08:03.544
Let's just go down there. The sooner
we end this we can get back

08:03.624 --> 08:05.584
to investigating Sharp. It's a joke,
innit.

08:05.664 --> 08:08.304
There's a time and a place for
voices. How come when I do it,

08:08.384 --> 08:10.344
it's not funny, when you do it,
it's funny.

08:11.504 --> 08:13.132
So let's just walk
down there nicely

08:13.145 --> 08:14.784
and ask them to open
the gate, yeah?

08:14.864 --> 08:17.384
Yeah, something like that. You know
me. I do know you.

08:19.544 --> 08:21.544
Stay there. Stay there!

08:23.624 --> 08:25.984
Shit! Fucking hell!

08:27.064 --> 08:29.304
Oi! It's police, open the door.

08:29.384 --> 08:32.264
Fuck off, you dirty piece - Did
you mum talk you to speak like that?

08:32.344 --> 08:34.624
Open the damn gate. With a fucking
warrant.

08:34.703 --> 08:37.504
Warrant, yeah? All right.

08:38.703 --> 08:41.784
Police, mate. I'm gonna need your
car. What?

08:41.864 --> 08:44.183
No. What do you mean, no? Give me
the keys, bruv.

08:44.264 --> 08:47.064
You don't look like police to me,
mate. Give him the damn keys!

08:47.144 --> 08:49.104
Thank you.

08:50.104 --> 08:52.104
Oi!

08:53.624 --> 08:56.544
Oh, shit! Man, you running over?

08:56.624 --> 08:58.584
Fucking make me run.

08:58.664 --> 09:00.664
Oi! You can't pull guns on a 15 year
old. Can't I?

09:00.744 --> 09:02.092
15 year olds
shouldn't be dealing

09:02.105 --> 09:03.624
drugs. That's a very
bad thing to do.

09:03.704 --> 09:05.664
Let this be a lesson to you.

09:12.864 --> 09:15.864
Through the fucking fence? I'll be
down in a moment.

09:15.944 --> 09:17.904
Oh, sorry, mate.
Yeah, you will be sorry.

09:17.984 --> 09:20.064
Fucking stop! Oi!

09:20.144 --> 09:22.424
Hey, little man, you better fucking
stop or I'll put one

09:22.504 --> 09:24.584
in your fucking leg. Fucker! Prick!

09:24.664 --> 09:27.864
Fucking come here! Telling you now,
you best fucking know.

09:32.624 --> 09:35.264
Don't you fucking try it, man.
Get out of the car.

09:35.344 --> 09:37.784
Get out of the fucking car.

09:37.864 --> 09:40.224
Yeah? You miss me,
you'll hit the kid.

09:40.304 --> 09:43.344
I won't give a fuck. But you might,
you prick.

09:48.144 --> 09:50.144
Fucking wankers!

09:52.504 --> 09:54.504
Shit.

09:56.744 --> 09:59.904
Fuck. Yeah, no backup, as usual.

10:02.546 --> 10:04.826
I think I'm getting too old for
this, man.

10:04.906 --> 10:07.106
The kid just laughed at me and jumped
into a Bentley.

10:07.186 --> 10:10.506
At least we've got one of them. What
did Jason Woods look like?

10:10.586 --> 10:12.586
Like a drug dealer driving
a Bentley.

10:12.666 --> 10:15.106
Jealous of the car? Trust me, I am.

10:15.186 --> 10:17.266
All the more reason to bury him,
right?

10:18.786 --> 10:21.586
And this moves us forward how?
Potential informant, Mum.

10:21.666 --> 10:24.266
He could walk your dog. Don't mention
my bloody dog.

10:24.346 --> 10:26.306
All right, it was a joke.

10:26.386 --> 10:29.026
The brief leaves and the social
worker arrives.

10:29.106 --> 10:31.346
We beat the shit out of him until he
tells us a location

10:31.426 --> 10:33.025
of Jason Woods' drug factory.
Very

10:33.038 --> 10:34.786
simple. Gonna file
that in my report.

10:34.866 --> 10:36.866
Scarlett Nugent.

10:36.946 --> 10:40.106
His social worker. Who'd even
letting you in?

10:40.186 --> 10:42.226
You can file whatever you want in
your report.

10:42.306 --> 10:44.306
He has valuable information that we
need.

10:44.386 --> 10:46.746
Aren't you a charmer.
I've been told that.

10:46.826 --> 10:49.106
I ain't got time for this. I know.

10:49.186 --> 10:52.266
Is that your way to a kid's heart?
Beat the shit out of them?

10:52.346 --> 10:55.066
He didn't exactly get off to the
best start. Methadone baby,

10:55.146 --> 10:58.866
14-day detox. His father was only 12
and his mother rejected him.

10:58.946 --> 11:00.906
He grew up in North Park Care
Home...

11:02.466 --> 11:05.186
..till he set fire to it. I managed
to get him fostered,

11:05.266 --> 11:07.266
a nice couple out in Essex,
the Fairlawns,

11:07.346 --> 11:10.866
and now he keeps running away. They
say they'll always take him back,

11:10.946 --> 11:14.026
because that's the way to a kid's
heart. Love.

11:15.786 --> 11:18.226
Now, mind if I see him?

11:20.306 --> 11:22.306
By all means.

11:26.346 --> 11:29.826
You think she'd give me her number?
I don't know but I like her.

11:29.906 --> 11:31.866
Yeah, me too, bruv.

11:33.626 --> 11:35.786
Was I right, cheese and onion?

11:37.786 --> 11:40.546
Ryan, after you've had your drink...

11:40.626 --> 11:43.586
these men would like to speak to you
about a man called Jason Woods.

11:43.666 --> 11:46.546
I don't know who that is.
That's a load of rubbish.

11:49.066 --> 11:52.506
Look, I've spoken to Mr and Mrs
Fairlawn and they're worried sick.

11:52.586 --> 11:55.466
All they wanna do is give you a good
home. It's best you cooperate

11:55.546 --> 11:57.746
with these men and tell them what
you know about Woods,

11:57.826 --> 12:02.066
and then we can get you bailed.
Ryan, do you want some more crisps?

12:02.146 --> 12:05.426
Is this a joke? If you keep talking
to him like he's five years old

12:05.506 --> 12:07.546
he's gonna keep acting up. Are you
stupid or what?

12:07.626 --> 12:10.026
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

12:10.106 --> 12:13.786
Think smart. Don't be obvious,
all right?

12:13.866 --> 12:16.946
Come on, man. You know what you
need to do.

12:18.866 --> 12:21.826
Gingernut, get up, on your feet.
Let's go. Come on, on your feet.

12:21.906 --> 12:24.626
Shut up. You can come too if you
want. You can't just -

12:24.706 --> 12:27.546
He can't call him a Gingernut,
not in this day and age.

12:40.586 --> 12:42.586
Bruv, you drive like an old woman.

12:45.626 --> 12:47.626
Miss you, hound.

12:58.746 --> 13:00.866
All right, Mum?

13:00.946 --> 13:02.906
Do you want any chocolate?

13:12.186 --> 13:15.866
You know what used to be over there?
North Park, innit?

13:18.066 --> 13:20.066
You know how I know that?

13:20.146 --> 13:22.106
Nah.

13:24.826 --> 13:27.026
I was on the second floor. Used to
share a room

13:27.106 --> 13:29.066
with Michael Dooley and Delroy Neil.

13:29.146 --> 13:31.506
The smell of their feet used to drive
me mad.

13:33.386 --> 13:36.386
Dooley hung himself because he
couldn't stop wetting the bed.

13:36.466 --> 13:38.426
It's a shame cos I actually liked
him.

13:39.666 --> 13:41.986
Do you wanna know what happened to
Delroy?

13:44.426 --> 13:46.426
Get in.

13:47.786 --> 13:50.546
Have a seat for a second. Let me chat
to her. Her?

13:50.626 --> 13:52.626
Just give me one minute with him.

13:57.466 --> 13:59.546
Fucking hell, bruv, what's going on?

14:04.666 --> 14:07.146
See that?

14:07.226 --> 14:10.666
That's Delroy right now. He used to
be a gangster and a dealer

14:10.746 --> 14:12.826
before he got hooked on a pipe
himself.

14:13.826 --> 14:16.106
Last thing I heard he was sucking
dick for rocks.

14:16.186 --> 14:19.746
Bet he's pretty good at it after all
his years of practice.

14:20.746 --> 14:22.746
You're not doing that yet, no?

14:28.066 --> 14:30.186
School of hard knocks, kid.

14:30.266 --> 14:32.466
This is real life out here,
real talk.

14:44.746 --> 14:47.026
Bishop should be careful. I know he
doesn't care

14:47.106 --> 14:49.226
but he could end up in front of
a tribunal.

14:49.306 --> 14:51.826
Actually, he does care, Mum,

14:51.906 --> 14:55.426
he just... has a funny way
of showing it.

14:58.146 --> 15:00.786
Oh, my God. What?

15:00.866 --> 15:04.266
You like him.
I'm just saying he cares.

15:04.346 --> 15:08.506
It's the way you said it.
Be careful cos anything you say

15:08.586 --> 15:11.426
in this foot spa could be used as
evidence against you

15:11.506 --> 15:14.626
in a court of law.
He's just a friend, OK.

15:14.706 --> 15:18.346
Tell the truth. Is that why you're
wearing lippy?

15:18.426 --> 15:20.906
I say fuck it. He's back on the
market.

15:23.186 --> 15:25.626
What the fuck is going on here?

15:25.706 --> 15:27.946
Hey, Mum, I need a word.

15:32.506 --> 15:34.506
Yeah?

15:34.586 --> 15:36.986
All right, Marvin? Yes, Mum.

15:39.466 --> 15:41.466
I need you to clear me to see
Barton.

15:41.546 --> 15:44.826
No. Mum, I'm gonna slip in, find out
if there's anything

15:44.906 --> 15:46.866
he forgot to tell us and
then I slip back out.

15:46.946 --> 15:49.786
No further enquiries. I said no.

15:49.866 --> 15:52.306
There's a reason why we were taken
off the Sharp case,

15:52.386 --> 15:55.426
and that's not because we fucked up.
I'm not stupid.

15:55.506 --> 15:57.666
Can you just help me find out why?
Please.

15:57.746 --> 15:59.706
No.

15:59.786 --> 16:02.786
Do you know what, I'm gonna head
down to the prison.

16:02.866 --> 16:05.826
If our relationship means anything
to you, anything at all,

16:05.906 --> 16:09.386
by the time I get down there, my
name will be cleared to see Barton.

16:09.466 --> 16:12.706
If not, I know where we stand.

16:26.266 --> 16:29.346
Matthew and Lorna fostered me when
I was ten years old.

16:30.466 --> 16:33.346
Used to take me to Camber Sands on
holiday.

16:34.986 --> 16:36.986
You should've seen me on the beach.

16:37.066 --> 16:39.266
Like a Malteser in a sea full of
Milky Bars.

16:41.986 --> 16:44.666
So I know how you feel, Junior.
You see me.

16:46.866 --> 16:48.866
Yeah?

16:53.786 --> 16:56.506
Cheers, which one? Just down all the
way to the right. Ta.

16:56.586 --> 17:01.546
You all right? Officer Pike, here
for a seg visit with 01132,

17:01.626 --> 17:03.586
Barton.

17:06.226 --> 17:09.465
Nothing here, pal. I think you need
to check with your boss.

17:10.826 --> 17:14.346
I have an Officer Pike to see 01132,

17:14.425 --> 17:16.386
Barton, segregation.

17:18.026 --> 17:20.826
Just checking.

17:20.906 --> 17:22.866
Yeah, he's clear.

17:27.665 --> 17:29.786
You've seen me play this trick
before.

17:30.866 --> 17:33.906
But now it's different.
These are my girls.

17:35.786 --> 17:38.946
Annie, she's 14. Donna, she's six.

17:39.946 --> 17:42.506
Annie plays piano. She's great, too.

17:42.586 --> 17:45.106
Political as well. Young radical.

17:45.186 --> 17:47.546
You see, Donna, she's a force
of nature.

17:47.626 --> 17:51.226
She's slightly deaf in one ear. Has
a hearing aid from time to time.

17:51.306 --> 17:54.386
I have to watch that.
Kids bully her.

17:56.306 --> 17:58.306
Why am I telling you all this?

18:00.386 --> 18:02.906
They nearly lost their father
the other day.

18:04.706 --> 18:07.706
It's someone you know. Ray.

18:09.746 --> 18:11.746
Vitiligo.

18:12.746 --> 18:15.426
Death stared me in the face,

18:15.506 --> 18:18.306
and I don't wanna see it again,
all right?

18:18.386 --> 18:22.466
Come on, Barton. Help me
and I'll help you.

18:24.186 --> 18:27.186
Just give me any little thing you
can. Any little crumb will do.

18:27.266 --> 18:31.546
I can get you cigarettes.
I can get you books,

18:31.626 --> 18:35.026
phone cards, visits.

18:35.106 --> 18:37.226
Bet you'd like to see your wife.

18:37.306 --> 18:39.266
I can make that happen.

18:41.626 --> 18:43.626
The weapons were used under work.

18:45.946 --> 18:50.506
He hired it out all the time.
Not tools.

18:50.586 --> 18:53.426
Unknown to supplier. OK.

18:58.546 --> 19:01.026
Get me a visit from my wife
and I'll tell you.

19:07.146 --> 19:09.346
Hey, Bish, do you still carry
that gun?

19:12.786 --> 19:14.786
Yep.

19:14.866 --> 19:16.826
Let me see that.

19:18.786 --> 19:22.146
Come on, let me see the fucking gun,
man. Come on, Bish. Please.

19:31.266 --> 19:33.266
Sounded real.

19:36.106 --> 19:38.266
There's no safety.

19:38.346 --> 19:41.026
Hammer stays down first, squeezes a
long one and then the weapon

19:41.106 --> 19:43.066
will discharge. Got it?

19:43.146 --> 19:45.826
You sound like a fed. You wanna
shoot the damn thing or not?

19:45.906 --> 19:47.866
All right, man, sorry.

19:50.946 --> 19:53.706
All right. Listen...

19:55.706 --> 19:57.449
..I never asked you
to grass up Jason

19:57.462 --> 19:58.986
Woods. That's not my style, man.

19:59.066 --> 20:01.026
But just know that when you leave me,

20:01.106 --> 20:03.066
I'm gonna follow you.

20:04.346 --> 20:08.066
To wherever you go, wherever you go
visit next...

20:08.146 --> 20:10.106
just know that I'll know.

20:11.946 --> 20:13.946
Oi, two hands.

20:15.746 --> 20:17.906
Fuck.

20:17.986 --> 20:19.946
Being good takes practice, man.
Give me.

20:20.026 --> 20:21.986
Get in the car.

20:27.066 --> 20:29.426
Mm-hm.

20:31.106 --> 20:33.040
Just wanted to say
you're a fucking

20:33.053 --> 20:35.106
legend. Don't ever
threaten me again.

20:35.186 --> 20:38.026
Thanks anyway. Ever.

20:39.026 --> 20:42.146
And, Pike, no-one else can know.

20:42.226 --> 20:44.186
This was a favour for a friend.

20:45.426 --> 20:47.666
Especially not your father.

20:49.218 --> 20:52.098
OK, don't write it down but remember
this number, OK.

20:52.178 --> 20:56.298
07700 900 880.

20:56.378 --> 20:59.138
Yeah, man, I got that. Locked it?
Yeah, come on, man,

20:59.218 --> 21:02.458
I'll call you, in't it? Got more
chances seeing rocking horse shit

21:02.538 --> 21:05.938
but all right, man. Yeah, but Mum
always said don't drive too fast,

21:06.018 --> 21:08.778
but there's no chance of that.
Come on, see you.

21:43.898 --> 21:46.378
You get the images I just sent you?

21:48.018 --> 21:50.858
Jason Woods. Yeah, it was only one
of this aliases.

21:50.938 --> 21:52.938
Turns out he's not just a drug
dealer,

21:53.018 --> 21:54.978
he's also been inside for attempted
murder.

21:55.058 --> 21:58.658
One of his young dealers. Woods put
150 stitches in his face

21:58.738 --> 22:00.698
for stealing from his drug
warehouse.

22:02.698 --> 22:05.178
Are you still there? Yeah.

22:05.258 --> 22:07.218
Where are you anyway?

22:08.338 --> 22:10.378
I'm sitting outside his drug
warehouse.

22:13.218 --> 22:16.178
I gotta go, babe. I'm seeing the old
man. Got a favour to ask.

22:16.258 --> 22:19.218
OK, darling. Let me know how it
goes, OK. Love you.

22:35.178 --> 22:38.098
It's definitely 7:00pm somewhere in
the world.

22:39.418 --> 22:41.418
Tell me...

22:41.498 --> 22:43.458
I've had a full day,
to say the least.

22:43.538 --> 22:46.458
Some kids selling drugs from the back
garden.

22:46.538 --> 22:49.498
I had to smash a car through the
fence to make an arrest.

22:49.578 --> 22:52.978
Picked up this IC1,
same age as Annie.

22:53.058 --> 22:56.298
I dunno whether I'm getting older or
these hoods are getting younger.

22:56.378 --> 22:58.778
Speaking of Annie, she's got a piano
recital coming up.

22:58.858 --> 23:01.498
She wanted to know if you and
Charlotte would come and watch her.

23:01.578 --> 23:03.858
Really need to get her a new piano.
She keeps on saying

23:03.938 --> 23:06.498
her mates don't practice on
electronic keyboards.

23:06.578 --> 23:09.418
I said it worked for Stevie Wonder.
She said, 'Who?'

23:11.538 --> 23:13.498
I give up.

23:15.338 --> 23:17.498
You want money for Arjana's
partnership.

23:17.578 --> 23:19.658
That's why you came here.

23:19.738 --> 23:22.018
It's just until she brings in some
clients.

23:22.098 --> 23:24.178
We'll pay you back in a couple
of months.

23:24.258 --> 23:26.218
'We?

23:28.898 --> 23:31.338
Amazing how marital dynamics shift

23:31.418 --> 23:34.218
when the breadwinner changes
from he to her.

23:34.298 --> 23:36.938
I do all right.
And I'm proud of you.

23:37.018 --> 23:40.178
But you have opportunity here,
available to you,

23:40.258 --> 23:44.258
that others not so fortunate will
never have.

23:44.338 --> 23:47.658
But, Dad, I came to ask you
for a favour,

23:47.738 --> 23:49.698
not to get a lecture on my career.

23:49.778 --> 23:51.778
And I'm offering a favour.

23:51.858 --> 23:53.818
But only if I do what you want.

23:53.898 --> 23:57.698
My ability to navigate will cease in
a few months when I retire.

23:57.778 --> 24:01.338
You have an opportunity to be
standing in my very shoes,

24:01.418 --> 24:04.818
but you choose to play cops and
robbers, which I respect,

24:04.898 --> 24:09.738
but everyone has the right to grow
old gracefully...

24:09.818 --> 24:12.018
especially those with privilege.

24:12.098 --> 24:14.458
That's what I've got, yeah?
Privilege.

24:14.538 --> 24:17.578
I can't imagine your friend Bishop
having this conversation.

24:17.658 --> 24:21.178
No, he would've fucking walked out by
now. Ah, the language

24:21.258 --> 24:26.618
of the streets. We always revert to
what feels comfortable.

24:28.578 --> 24:31.578
Even if it's not where we feel
comfortable.

24:36.178 --> 24:38.178
Do you know what...

24:38.258 --> 24:40.458
I'm comfortable right where I am,

24:40.538 --> 24:42.498
even if it doesn't suit your image.

25:02.978 --> 25:07.538
Kelly Barton? Who are you? I'm Adam
Cole, a parole liaison officer.

25:07.618 --> 25:10.298
I'm here to arrange a visit with you
and your husband.

25:11.298 --> 25:13.298
Come in. Yeah, come in.

25:17.618 --> 25:19.778
I thought he'd forgotten about us.

25:19.858 --> 25:21.818
My kids have climbing the walls.

25:22.818 --> 25:25.018
He's a good father at the end of the
day, no matter what

25:25.098 --> 25:27.058
he's supposed to have done.

25:27.138 --> 25:29.778
Can I go and see him straight away?

25:29.858 --> 25:32.287
Once you've cleared me?
I need to ask

25:32.300 --> 25:34.418
you a couple of questions first,

25:34.498 --> 25:37.298
about your husband, just for my
reference.

25:37.378 --> 25:40.698
Sure. Anything I can do to help,
Mr Cole.

25:40.778 --> 25:42.738
It's Adam.

25:42.818 --> 25:45.818
Anyway... to your knowledge,

25:45.898 --> 25:48.541
has your husband
ever been associated

25:48.554 --> 25:50.858
with a man called Michael Sharp?

25:52.058 --> 25:54.058
I've never heard him mention
that name.

25:54.138 --> 25:56.258
What about a man called Ray.

25:56.338 --> 25:58.778
Ray who? I don't have a surname.

25:58.858 --> 26:02.098
He has an identifying mark
on his wrist.

26:02.178 --> 26:04.578
Are you familiar with vitiligo?

26:04.658 --> 26:07.098
Yeah, Michael Jackson had it.

26:10.658 --> 26:12.658
I can't help you there.

26:14.218 --> 26:16.218
Sorry.

26:16.298 --> 26:18.258
OK.

26:20.138 --> 26:22.218
I think we're done.

26:22.298 --> 26:24.458
Leave it with me, Kelly.

26:24.538 --> 26:27.538
We will get your visit processed
straight away, OK.

26:27.618 --> 26:29.658
Thank you. No problem.

26:38.938 --> 26:40.858
Mix it, mix it, mix it

27:02.818 --> 27:05.178
Just in time for supper, darling.

27:05.258 --> 27:07.578
Oh, bro, you melt me.

27:07.658 --> 27:10.058
Mm. Thank you, man.

27:12.258 --> 27:15.978
What's going on? How did you get on
with Barton?

27:16.058 --> 27:20.178
Yeah, said he will talk in exchange
for a visit with his wife,

27:20.258 --> 27:22.218
which I'm sorting.

27:22.298 --> 27:24.898
Yeah, you're sorting, are you?
Well, you know me.

27:24.978 --> 27:27.938
All right. How'd you get on with
Jason Woods?

27:29.418 --> 27:31.578
Got an address. How was the kid?

27:31.658 --> 27:35.178
Textbook little brat. Probably never
hear from him again.

27:37.978 --> 27:40.698
What's wrong, man? Why the long face?

27:42.618 --> 27:45.298
It's usually me asking you that.
Yeah, I know, but you know what,

27:45.378 --> 27:47.898
bruv... I've got my swagger back.

27:47.978 --> 27:50.458
I'm glad to see one of us is on
form, bro.

27:55.218 --> 27:57.218
You know what...

27:58.698 --> 28:00.818
..I dunno what I'd do without you,
man.

28:06.538 --> 28:08.818
Hey. Hey. Quick threesome?

28:11.378 --> 28:15.578
I was talking about the wine. Bish,
do you wanna do the honours?

28:15.658 --> 28:18.658
Give me the bottle. Your wife wants
me to pour it.

28:18.738 --> 28:20.978
She don't trust your pouring,
that's why.

28:21.058 --> 28:24.538
I know he's stingy with the pouring.
Thank you. No worries.

28:26.818 --> 28:29.658
You OK? Yeah. Just relax, relax.

28:31.258 --> 28:33.258
Hmm...

28:36.458 --> 28:40.298
Right, you know what...
I'm gonna go to bed.

28:41.298 --> 28:43.898
Yeah. This is mine, yeah.
It's got my wine still.

28:43.978 --> 28:46.978
All right. Goodnight. Oh, hold on.

28:47.058 --> 28:50.498
Just get my cake. All right. Night.
Goodnight.

28:58.058 --> 29:01.138
I detect slightly crumpled shoulders
on my lion.

29:01.218 --> 29:03.738
It's my dad about the buy in.

29:03.818 --> 29:06.618
There's too many strings attached,
babe.

29:06.698 --> 29:08.658
Dad wants my soul.

29:10.138 --> 29:12.338
I dunno why I never realised he was
gonna be like that.

29:12.418 --> 29:15.738
It's all right. I'm a happy woman.

29:15.818 --> 29:17.778
And I'm a happy man.

29:23.818 --> 29:26.858
And... I've got an idea. Oh, yeah?

29:26.938 --> 29:28.898
Who can help.

29:44.578 --> 29:46.858
Bishop. Yo.

29:48.618 --> 29:50.618
Yeah, who's this? It's Ginger.

29:50.698 --> 29:53.978
Yeah, Ginger, what's happening, man?
No, nothing. Just a pocket call.

29:57.058 --> 29:59.418
OK, listen to me...

29:59.498 --> 30:02.098
don't go to Silvertown tomorrow
morning, all right?

30:02.178 --> 30:05.338
Yeah. Yeah, just...

30:06.498 --> 30:08.498
..just stay home for me.

30:10.058 --> 30:12.058
All right, nice one, Bishop.
See you.

30:12.138 --> 30:14.098
OK, cool.

30:19.778 --> 30:21.778
OK, on it.

30:24.378 --> 30:26.458
Why'd she slam the door so rough?
I don't know.

30:29.538 --> 30:31.858
She's been working on her legs.
Just an observation.

30:32.818 --> 30:34.818
Puts me to shame, really.

30:40.538 --> 30:43.978
Straight-right. Munroe? Left hook.

30:46.218 --> 30:48.258
Oh! Ooh!

30:48.338 --> 30:51.178
Yes! Thank you.

30:58.858 --> 31:01.578
Munroe, chains, Kamali, CCTV.

31:01.658 --> 31:03.618
Nell, weapon.

31:09.018 --> 31:11.018
Are you ready? Yep.

31:20.978 --> 31:22.978
Woo-hoo-hoo!

31:24.178 --> 31:26.178
Armed police, get down on the floor!

31:26.258 --> 31:28.218
Don't move!

31:28.298 --> 31:30.618
Down on the floor now! Nobody move.

31:30.698 --> 31:32.658
Keep still!

31:32.738 --> 31:35.738
Munroe. Put the weapon down.

31:36.538 --> 31:39.618
Kam, cover him. Put the weapon down.

31:39.698 --> 31:41.658
Put the weapon down.

31:41.738 --> 31:43.938
Put the weapon down!

31:44.018 --> 31:45.978
Put it down.

31:47.378 --> 31:50.698
Jason Woods, where is he?

31:50.778 --> 31:54.298
Where is he? Where is he?!

31:54.378 --> 31:57.858
Now, one of you best start talking.
Where is he?!

32:14.213 --> 32:16.213
Kam!

32:18.733 --> 32:20.813
Are you OK? Yeah.

32:24.133 --> 32:26.133
Bish, move, bro.

32:28.053 --> 32:30.053
Moving.

32:37.773 --> 32:39.773
Don't move! Stay there, boy.

32:39.853 --> 32:43.293
Don't move. I don't wanna shoot you,
but I will.

32:43.373 --> 32:45.453
Put the gun down.

32:45.533 --> 32:48.173
Put it down. Put it down!

32:52.173 --> 32:54.173
Shit!

33:04.487 --> 33:07.207
Go to sleep, bruv. Go to sleep.

33:11.027 --> 33:13.027
Oh, yeah, you're under arrest.

33:29.387 --> 33:31.907
Boys! Found him! Shut up, bitch,
and walk.

33:31.987 --> 33:35.027
Jason Woods, you're under arrest.
You do not have to say anything,

33:35.107 --> 33:37.787
but it may harm your defence if you
do not mention when questioned

33:37.867 --> 33:39.987
something which you later rely on in
court.

33:40.067 --> 33:42.707
Put those fucking guns down.
Anything you do say

33:42.787 --> 33:45.587
may be giving in evidence.
I'll shoot.

33:52.827 --> 33:54.867
Wow!

33:58.239 --> 34:00.239
Shit. Yeah, man.

34:01.214 --> 34:03.614
That's the thing though, boys.
I weren't scared at all.

34:03.694 --> 34:06.374
Bang, done them, another one
in the bag.

34:06.454 --> 34:09.293
That's what I'm saying.
I mean, what a team, eh?

34:09.373 --> 34:11.454
I mean, us three,
that's world class.

34:11.534 --> 34:13.893
I gotta tell you, yeah...

34:13.974 --> 34:16.134
I think the world of you both.

34:16.214 --> 34:19.414
Shut up, man. It's your boy,
you deal with it.

34:26.774 --> 34:30.054
Sorry, Bish. Bro, these are my
Red Dragons, man.

34:30.134 --> 34:32.094
Just gonna throw up on my shoes,
yeah?

34:32.174 --> 34:35.054
Miss Carmel, can we have a quick
word? I've only just arrived

34:35.134 --> 34:37.454
and I'm yet to speak to the team
that conducted the raid,

34:37.534 --> 34:39.494
but I imagine it's good news.

34:39.574 --> 34:42.813
Thank you. Miss Carmel...
Hello, everyone.

34:42.893 --> 34:44.853
Good afternoon.

34:44.934 --> 34:47.214
Congratulations. Thank you.

34:50.054 --> 34:52.454
You're not winded or anything?

34:52.534 --> 34:57.014
A little bit, but I'll be fine.
I just want a burger.

34:58.694 --> 35:03.534
Sorting that. Yeah. Oh, thank you,
that is so kind.

35:03.614 --> 35:05.574
You did good.

35:05.654 --> 35:07.854
It'd do wonders for my campaign.

35:07.934 --> 35:10.174
Well, you should tell my dad that.

35:10.254 --> 35:12.214
He doesn't seem to get it.

35:12.294 --> 35:15.454
Well, you know your father,
he's a different era.

35:15.534 --> 35:18.134
Keeps a lid on it. That's what you
got godparents for.

35:19.534 --> 35:21.734
Mm... Oh, Jesus.

35:21.814 --> 35:25.174
Oh, God, it takes like piss.
Do you want some?

35:25.254 --> 35:27.214
No, I'm all right.

35:28.494 --> 35:30.974
There is something that I wanted to
ask you about. Yeah?

35:31.054 --> 35:33.014
Say it right now.

35:34.654 --> 35:36.694
Well, basically - Yo, Pike!

35:36.774 --> 35:39.134
Did you see what Munroe done to my
trainers?

35:39.214 --> 35:41.894
It's not even a joke.

35:58.334 --> 36:01.494
What's this? Your first client.

36:01.574 --> 36:03.734
It should help with your
partnership.

36:03.814 --> 36:07.254
You can't. Darling, I am the deputy
mayor of London.

36:07.334 --> 36:11.534
You're not serious? Arjana, you're
family to me.

36:11.614 --> 36:13.574
Did Ronnie...?

36:22.374 --> 36:24.574
I think Munroe's got a thing for me,
you know.

36:24.654 --> 36:26.415
There's nothing wrong
with it, legit.

36:26.428 --> 36:28.014
Cos he threw up
on your trainers?

36:28.094 --> 36:30.534
Yeah, but it's a sign of affection,
innit? Shut up.

36:30.614 --> 36:33.734
Anyone want some of this?
You crack on, Kam.

36:33.814 --> 36:36.814
There you go, guys. My man. Can I
say, Kamali, you're looking

36:36.894 --> 36:40.934
particularly fine tonight.
Are you hitting on her?

36:41.014 --> 36:43.134
Flattery, but I dig chicks.

36:43.214 --> 36:46.014
Dig what? Let me spell it out for
you, I'm a lesbian.

36:46.094 --> 36:48.414
Do I look like one?

36:48.534 --> 36:50.734
What does one look like? Leave while
you still can.

36:50.814 --> 36:53.934
Leave while you still can.
We do love you, Mick.

36:54.014 --> 36:55.974
Bless him.

36:56.054 --> 36:58.294
You wanker.

36:58.374 --> 37:00.334
Tanner told me I'd find you here.

37:00.414 --> 37:04.534
You are an arrogant, flash,
self-seeking, narcissistic prick.

37:06.094 --> 37:08.094
Compliments keep coming.

37:08.174 --> 37:10.374
But I owe you an apology.

37:10.454 --> 37:13.094
That you do, and I thank you.

37:13.174 --> 37:15.854
This is Kamali and Nell, by the way,
our lovely team.

37:15.934 --> 37:18.374
You all right?

37:18.454 --> 37:20.974
Whatever they're drinking,
I'll have two.

37:25.174 --> 37:28.654
Ryan is back with his foster
parents.

37:28.734 --> 37:31.454
He's been under my care since he was
nine, and he's never showed

37:31.534 --> 37:33.854
a mild interest in anything, let
alone actually told me

37:33.934 --> 37:36.974
he liked anything... apart from you.

37:38.774 --> 37:41.494
The little shit even said you were
cool. Am I missing something?

37:41.574 --> 37:44.374
I don't think so.
Shut up, man, you lot.

37:46.494 --> 37:50.294
I owe you one. Not like that, pal.

37:53.294 --> 37:55.294
Not yet, anyway.

37:55.374 --> 37:58.814
Yeah? Gotta work for it. All right.
I think that calls for a toast.

37:58.894 --> 38:01.214
Bishop... you complete wanker.

38:01.294 --> 38:03.534
Yeah, all right.

38:06.014 --> 38:09.254
So, how do you get your rocks off
when you're not kicking in doors?

38:09.334 --> 38:11.414
I can think of a few things I like
to do.

38:11.494 --> 38:14.934
Are you gonna enlighten me or do I
have to drag it out of you?

38:17.454 --> 38:20.334
I like the sound of you dragging it
out of me, if I'm honest.

38:20.414 --> 38:24.494
Honestly, let's do that. I know you
agree with me.

38:28.414 --> 38:30.414
Can we get some burgers, mate?

38:38.054 --> 38:40.454
You all right, baby? Yeah. Are you?

38:40.534 --> 38:42.494
Mm-hm.

38:51.614 --> 38:53.614
Thank you.

39:18.494 --> 39:21.494
Morning. Nice gown.

39:23.614 --> 39:25.614
So how was your night?

39:25.694 --> 39:29.174
What the hell? I've got knickers on.
No! No!

39:29.254 --> 39:32.654
No! Why, good morning.

39:35.054 --> 39:37.054
Good morning.

39:38.054 --> 39:40.814
Bro, I honestly don't remember what
happened. We must've just -

39:40.894 --> 39:43.374
I know what happened.

39:43.454 --> 39:45.854
You can't bring chicks into my yard
like that, bro.

39:45.934 --> 39:49.134
Not with the girls here. She didn't
have any clothes on.

39:49.214 --> 39:52.014
I know, man. I'm sorry.

39:52.094 --> 39:54.774
I know you're getting your swagger
back and all that, but...

39:54.854 --> 39:57.654
don't you think it's time you kinda
thought about, like...

39:58.654 --> 40:01.734
Come on, man, we're family. I like
it here. So do I.

40:06.334 --> 40:09.814
What colour were the pants on her?
Can't be asking me questions

40:09.894 --> 40:12.094
like that about... Black.

40:12.174 --> 40:14.974
Yeah. Get dressed, yeah?

40:15.054 --> 40:17.214
We've gotta go and visit Barton with
his wife.

40:20.854 --> 40:22.934
And how was your night?

40:23.014 --> 40:25.814
Colourful would be a good adjective.

40:25.894 --> 40:28.614
Saying you didn't know he was
a black man, or...?

40:28.734 --> 40:31.614
As in he called me Sophie and fell
asleep. What?!

40:31.694 --> 40:34.534
Are you serious? Wow.

40:34.614 --> 40:36.574
Ooh, I've got ammo now.

40:50.294 --> 40:52.294
Barton's dead.

40:57.014 --> 40:59.494
They're keeping their cards close.

40:59.574 --> 41:02.494
My contacts tell me that he had his
throat cut in the shower.

41:15.654 --> 41:18.774
You lied to me.
You fucking lied to me!

41:34.334 --> 41:37.574
I didn't cause Barton's murder.
You disobeyed a direct order.

41:37.654 --> 41:40.494
If you guys were gonna look for a
Luger, where would you start?

41:40.574 --> 41:42.527
The same one used by your
friend Ray to murder

41:42.540 --> 41:44.254
Dan Brown, Curtis Cox
and Michael Sharp.

41:44.334 --> 41:46.014
Jonesy's back this afternoon.

41:46.094 --> 41:49.294
If you're gonna have a go at me,
let's not do it here.

41:49.374 --> 41:52.374
I wanna buy a piece. I don't know
what you're talking about. Oh!

41:52.454 --> 41:56.294
Family's all that matters. Look
after yours, my friend.

41:56.374 --> 41:57.334
That's him.

41:57.414 --> 42:00.014
Pike! Pike!
