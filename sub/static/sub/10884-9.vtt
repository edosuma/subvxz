00:04.308 --> 00:05.609
Previousy on "Stitchers"...

00:05.634 --> 00:07.120
You have a sister.

00:07.145 --> 00:08.886
- What's her name?
- Ivy Brown.

00:08.911 --> 00:09.954
Ivy: <i>Don't call me again.</i>

00:09.979 --> 00:11.024
I've been trying to get a hold

00:11.049 --> 00:12.557
of my dad's doctor
for the last two days.

00:12.582 --> 00:15.186
Kirsten: <i>My father stitching
me into my mother killed her.</i>

00:15.211 --> 00:17.191
I know you're focusing
on finding your father,

00:17.216 --> 00:19.011
but honestly,
it sounds like a stretch, Stretch.

00:19.036 --> 00:21.386
Not all roads lead to Daniel Stinger.

00:21.411 --> 00:23.103
Woman: <i>When I think you're
ready to hear the truth,</i>

00:23.128 --> 00:25.462
<i>I'll find you, Kirsten.</i>

00:25.487 --> 00:27.624
Kirsten? You're using me

00:27.649 --> 00:29.405
to send a message to the girl?

00:29.430 --> 00:30.823
(stabbing)

00:30.848 --> 00:33.610
Kirsten: <i>My father killed
Les Turner and Ed Clark.</i>

00:33.635 --> 00:34.977
So when can you hand off Liam to me?

00:35.002 --> 00:37.099
- Camille, what's up?
- It turns out

00:37.124 --> 00:40.613
she's not as completely over
you as I originally thought.

00:40.638 --> 00:42.593
(cellphone camera clicking)

00:42.843 --> 00:45.413
<i>It's Ivy. I've changed my mind.</i>

00:45.438 --> 00:46.805
<i>When can we meet?</i>

00:53.391 --> 00:55.023
Yes, sir.

00:59.841 --> 01:01.131
Fisher?

01:01.156 --> 01:03.057
Fisher?

01:03.695 --> 01:05.628
What's up?

01:05.672 --> 01:08.039
- You look...
- Pissed off?

01:08.064 --> 01:08.996
Yes, I am.

01:09.021 --> 01:10.653
- Something I did?
- I hope not.

01:10.678 --> 01:12.733
Someone leaked the
Langston case to the press.

01:12.758 --> 01:14.388
I thought we were keeping
a tight lid on this one?

01:14.413 --> 01:16.213
We were. Where is everyone else?

01:16.493 --> 01:18.539
Well,
Cameron's dealing with girlfriend issues

01:18.563 --> 01:19.898
and Camille is with
Linus at the hospital.

01:19.923 --> 01:22.734
And Kirsten?

01:23.224 --> 01:24.774
And Kirsten?

01:24.799 --> 01:27.243
- You're welcome.
- For what?

01:27.269 --> 01:30.028
Plausible deniability I
just gave you by not saying.

01:30.053 --> 01:32.967
This way you don't have to lie to
Blair when he asks you if you knew.

01:34.613 --> 01:36.292
Knew what?

01:36.579 --> 01:39.079
(knocking at door)

01:51.662 --> 01:53.862
Ivy.

01:53.894 --> 01:55.817
It's so nice to meet you. I'm Kirsten.

01:55.842 --> 01:57.789
I'm not coming in.

01:57.825 --> 01:59.258
I'm not staying.

01:59.293 --> 02:02.086
I know you're thinking, "She's here.

02:02.111 --> 02:05.075
She might as well come
in for a cup of tea,"

02:05.100 --> 02:08.936
or a chai latte or whatever the
hell it is you like to drink.

02:08.961 --> 02:10.574
Coffee, black.

02:10.600 --> 02:13.935
Me too. Oh, look, we're bonding.

02:14.952 --> 02:17.385
Um, so why won't you come in?

02:17.410 --> 02:20.405
'Cause I've only got one thing to
say to you and it won't take long.

02:20.429 --> 02:22.640
I'm not telling you where my father is.

02:22.665 --> 02:24.246
Our father.

02:24.794 --> 02:26.701
And you could have
said that on the phone.

02:26.726 --> 02:28.316
I wanted to say it to your face,

02:28.341 --> 02:31.221
make sure there was no
mistaking my position.

02:31.246 --> 02:34.247
Also I wanted to see you,

02:34.272 --> 02:36.538
see what you look like.

02:38.204 --> 02:40.967
You look just like your mother.

02:42.419 --> 02:44.352
Now I get why he left me.

02:44.871 --> 02:47.506
He left me too, when I was eight.

02:49.728 --> 02:52.100
Tell me where he is.

02:52.366 --> 02:55.214
I finally have a relationship with him,

02:55.239 --> 02:58.598
which I didn't for years because of you.

02:58.623 --> 03:00.273
And now you want back in his life?

03:00.298 --> 03:02.645
- I need to see him.
- I can't help you.

03:02.670 --> 03:04.606
Don't call me again.

03:04.631 --> 03:06.683
He's being hunted by the NSA.

03:06.708 --> 03:08.541
Because he's brilliant.

03:08.724 --> 03:11.094
And they want to exploit his work.

03:11.119 --> 03:13.478
No, because he's a killer.

03:13.503 --> 03:15.440
He killed three people.

03:15.465 --> 03:18.522
You don't know what
you're talking about.

03:21.656 --> 03:23.440
Actually, I do.

03:23.575 --> 03:25.508
And if you help me get to him first,

03:25.532 --> 03:29.427
then the next time that you and
I meet won't be at his funeral.

03:33.495 --> 03:36.830
I think I'll take that coffee now.

03:36.855 --> 03:38.911
Black.

04:04.193 --> 04:07.445
- (door closes)
- I know my dad.

04:07.470 --> 04:09.185
He's not a murderer.

04:09.210 --> 04:10.690
When's the last time you saw him?

04:10.715 --> 04:13.468
You tell me. You're NSA.

04:13.493 --> 04:16.637
Yeah, it doesn't really work like that.

04:16.663 --> 04:19.478
Yes, it does. That's how you found me.

04:19.504 --> 04:20.802
Isn't it?

04:24.809 --> 04:27.231
It was a tip from an informant.

04:27.256 --> 04:29.805
(tea kettle whistling)

04:29.830 --> 04:32.831
So who is it Dad supposedly killed?

04:32.856 --> 04:35.124
The head of my team at the NSA.

04:35.594 --> 04:38.390
Also Ed Clark, the man who raised me.

04:39.047 --> 04:41.113
You said three people.

04:43.666 --> 04:45.944
He also killed my mother.

04:46.665 --> 04:48.966
There was a car accident.

04:48.991 --> 04:52.213
He tried to save her using the
technology he developed for the NSA.

04:52.238 --> 04:54.816
He killed her instead.

04:56.421 --> 04:58.788
Then her death was an accident.

04:58.813 --> 05:00.530
It doesn't matter.

05:00.555 --> 05:03.923
Dad said he created something
that could change the world

05:03.948 --> 05:06.403
and that dangerous people were after it.

05:06.428 --> 05:07.656
That's why he's had to lay low.

05:07.681 --> 05:10.568
(laughs) Yeah, we're
not dangerous people.

05:10.593 --> 05:13.294
We use his technology to
solve very serious crimes.

05:13.319 --> 05:16.220
So what is it? Dad would never tell me.

05:16.245 --> 05:18.704
Probably to protect you.

05:19.328 --> 05:20.810
And I can't say either.

05:20.835 --> 05:22.329
I would put the people
that I work with at risk.

05:22.354 --> 05:25.122
So please tell me where he is.

05:25.147 --> 05:28.014
Dad predicted you'd find me one day

05:28.039 --> 05:31.709
and beg me to take you to him.
He made me promise not to.

05:31.734 --> 05:34.244
- Why?
- He said he'd find you himself

05:34.268 --> 05:37.148
when you were ready to hear the truth.

05:41.023 --> 05:43.346
Someone once sent me a message

05:43.371 --> 05:45.908
that sounded a lot
like that. Was it you?

05:46.418 --> 05:48.160
No.

05:56.182 --> 05:58.749
I know it's hard for you to
wrap your head around this,

05:58.774 --> 06:01.007
but you've only heard
Stinger's side of the story.

06:01.032 --> 06:04.266
If you knew our father,
you'd know he'd never kill anyone.

06:04.291 --> 06:06.657
- Then let me meet him.
- Not gonna happen.

06:06.682 --> 06:09.770
- Why not?
- I need to understand what's going on.

06:09.795 --> 06:12.896
Is this all connected to
the technology he developed?

06:13.747 --> 06:14.979
Partly.

06:16.508 --> 06:18.546
Then tell me about it...

06:19.082 --> 06:21.320
and I'll tell you how to find him.

06:22.604 --> 06:24.671
An exchange of information?

06:25.794 --> 06:27.594
A sharing of secrets.

06:28.624 --> 06:30.357
Just like sisters do.

06:31.678 --> 06:32.844
Deal.

06:34.176 --> 06:37.560
- Where is he?
- I came to you.

06:37.585 --> 06:39.655
Now it's your turn to meet me halfway.

06:43.199 --> 06:47.178
Uh, the technology is...
It's... complicated.

06:47.203 --> 06:49.613
I... I need to give it some context.

06:49.638 --> 06:50.869
You mean stall.

06:50.894 --> 06:53.479
No, I mean give it some context.

06:56.242 --> 06:59.110
When you called,
the reason I couldn't meet you sooner

06:59.135 --> 07:02.069
was because we'd just been
handed a murder investigation.

07:02.094 --> 07:03.648
Who's the "we"?

07:03.673 --> 07:06.570
My team. Let's begin with...

07:06.595 --> 07:09.328
Cameron, you okay?

07:09.353 --> 07:11.977
What? Oh, me? Yeah, no, I'm fine.

07:12.002 --> 07:13.407
I'm totally... Totally fine.

07:13.432 --> 07:16.877
(laughs) Uh, you're doing
that thing with your hair...

07:16.902 --> 07:19.248
That thing that you... yeah. Spill it.

07:19.274 --> 07:22.838
Um, Nina's frozen me out.

07:22.863 --> 07:24.963
She's not responding to my texts, so...

07:24.988 --> 07:26.634
What did you do?

07:26.659 --> 07:29.871
You must have done
something to piss her off.

07:29.896 --> 07:31.396
I canceled dinner on her twice.

07:31.421 --> 07:33.490
It was because of work, all right?

07:33.515 --> 07:35.880
And as I recall,
part of that work was saving your life,

07:35.905 --> 07:37.320
which of course, I can't tell her,

07:37.345 --> 07:39.618
so you're welcome.

07:40.288 --> 07:43.022
So this Cameron guy has
a great head of hair

07:43.047 --> 07:45.280
and it completely clueless about women?

07:45.305 --> 07:48.407
Hmm. He's also pretty
endearing and kind of awesome

07:48.432 --> 07:50.257
when he's not pissing me off.

07:51.468 --> 07:53.271
What?

07:53.296 --> 07:56.242
Nothing. But how is he relevant here?

07:56.267 --> 07:58.901
There's no one that knows
Stinger's tech better than Cameron.

07:58.926 --> 08:00.321
Fine, go on.

08:00.346 --> 08:03.219
So the murder victim was Josh Langston.

08:03.244 --> 08:07.009
26 years old,
shot dead in his Westwood apartment.

08:07.034 --> 08:08.815
He was Senator Langston's son.

08:08.840 --> 08:10.407
Does it have anything
to do with his father?

08:10.432 --> 08:12.293
Fisher: Possibly.
The kid's got a clean record.

08:12.318 --> 08:14.618
No problems in his
professional or personal life.

08:14.643 --> 08:15.778
A robbery gone bad?

08:15.803 --> 08:17.780
No signs of a struggle.
No breaking and entering.

08:17.805 --> 08:20.840
- Maybe he knew his killer.
- I think he did.

08:20.865 --> 08:22.975
Josh was a host on ZipCouch,

08:23.000 --> 08:26.816
a new couch-surfing app for "adventurous
and thrifty young travelers."

08:26.841 --> 08:30.346
Nick Mero, tech nerd
turned hipster mogul,

08:30.371 --> 08:32.413
started ZipCouch when he was 28.

08:32.438 --> 08:33.857
According to Josh's profile,

08:33.883 --> 08:35.850
he was expecting a new guest last night.

08:35.875 --> 08:37.808
Meet Denise Buchwald.

08:37.833 --> 08:40.639
She's a swimsuit model who
grew up on a popcorn farm

08:40.664 --> 08:43.414
just outside Des Moines.
Still calls Iowa home.

08:43.438 --> 08:45.331
She doesn't look like
she could kill anything.

08:45.356 --> 08:46.855
She didn't. That's a fake profile.

08:46.880 --> 08:50.318
- There's no Denise Buchwald.
- But there is a senator.

08:52.358 --> 08:55.452
Jefferson Langston, the victim's father.

08:55.477 --> 08:58.739
And the senator is a friend
of the Stitchers program.

08:58.764 --> 09:00.856
The Stitchers program?

09:01.056 --> 09:05.125
Yeah, it's... It's
what we call ourselves,

09:05.160 --> 09:09.513
um, because we stitch together
clues that other agencies miss.

09:09.538 --> 09:11.645
And Dad's technology helps you do that?

09:11.670 --> 09:12.769
Mm-hmm.

09:12.794 --> 09:15.264
So what is it? Some kind of algorithm?

09:15.289 --> 09:16.764
Artificial Intelligence?

09:16.789 --> 09:18.882
We couldn't do what we do without it.

09:18.907 --> 09:21.266
The guy who told us about the senator...

09:21.291 --> 09:23.145
His name is Mitchell Blair.

09:23.170 --> 09:26.511
Senator Langston has been
instrumental in securing our funding.

09:26.536 --> 09:29.670
He is in pain. He is looking
to us to find his son's killer,

09:29.695 --> 09:33.536
so until then, I want a tight
lid kept on this investigation.

09:33.561 --> 09:35.628
We all clear?

09:36.884 --> 09:38.268
Good. Good, good.

09:38.293 --> 09:40.260
Oh, yes, and effective immediately,

09:40.285 --> 09:43.539
you will end your unauthorized
search for Daniel Stinger.

09:44.441 --> 09:46.203
All of you.

09:46.608 --> 09:49.402
You can't tell me to stop
looking for my father.

09:49.427 --> 09:50.677
I just did.

09:50.702 --> 09:53.614
Your obsessive drive to find him
has been a distraction at best.

09:53.639 --> 09:56.031
I will handle the hunt for Stinger,

09:56.056 --> 09:59.496
which also means no more
contact with Liam Granger.

09:59.521 --> 10:02.308
Liam? What does he have to do with this?

10:02.333 --> 10:03.532
Cameron, later.

10:03.557 --> 10:07.149
No more Stinger. No more Granger.

10:08.233 --> 10:11.695
- Make sure of it.
- Done.

10:14.457 --> 10:15.972
You sold me out.

10:15.997 --> 10:18.301
As much as we would both
like to find Daniel Stinger,

10:18.327 --> 10:20.274
I am not going to defy a direct order.

10:20.298 --> 10:21.953
Mitchell Blair is our boss.

10:21.979 --> 10:23.527
You're protecting your own ass.

10:23.552 --> 10:25.834
I protect all our asses.

10:25.859 --> 10:28.579
If Blair says that he is
handling the search for Stinger,

10:28.604 --> 10:30.337
then he is handling it.

10:30.551 --> 10:33.779
So that's why I need
to find Stinger first.

10:33.803 --> 10:36.227
Once Blair unleashes the
full fury of the NSA...

10:36.252 --> 10:38.319
I get it... Fire and brimstone.

10:38.344 --> 10:40.244
What is it already?

10:40.269 --> 10:41.560
What was he working on?

10:41.585 --> 10:43.911
You haven't told me where he is.

10:43.936 --> 10:46.340
He's west of the Mississippi. Your turn.

10:49.832 --> 10:54.167
It's... very powerful.

10:54.192 --> 10:56.833
It lets us, um,

10:56.858 --> 10:58.891
question people

10:58.916 --> 11:01.890
that wouldn't normally
submit to being questioned.

11:01.915 --> 11:04.182
What, like a better way to waterboard?

11:04.207 --> 11:06.703
No. It's painless, I promise you.

11:06.728 --> 11:08.360
Cameron:
Mission clock to five minutes, please.

11:08.385 --> 11:11.085
- (beeps)
- Induce stitch neurosync on my mark.

11:11.110 --> 11:13.611
In three, two, one, mark!

11:13.636 --> 11:16.790
(whirring)

11:27.580 --> 11:29.179
Kirsten: <i>I'm in Josh's apartment.</i>

11:29.204 --> 11:30.971
Looks like he's getting
ready for company.

11:30.996 --> 11:33.497
(doorbell rings)

11:37.151 --> 11:39.744
- Abby?
- In the real. Josh?

11:39.769 --> 11:41.287
Yeah. Please come in.

11:41.312 --> 11:43.078
Someone named Abby just showed up.

11:43.103 --> 11:44.630
They don't seem to know each other.

11:44.655 --> 11:45.889
According to Josh's profile,

11:45.915 --> 11:48.458
Abby Newton couch-surfed at
his place two nights ago.

11:48.483 --> 11:51.163
She gave him five out of six cushions.

11:54.351 --> 11:57.199
Nice place.

11:57.224 --> 11:59.821
You a clean freak, or
is this just for me?

11:59.846 --> 12:01.831
A man's home should reflect who he is.

12:03.944 --> 12:06.563
Confident. I dig that.

12:06.588 --> 12:10.020
You take good pictures.

12:11.452 --> 12:14.476
Wait, who is this old guy?
He looks familiar.

12:14.501 --> 12:18.197
Senator Langston... My father.

12:18.222 --> 12:20.295
Kirsten: <i>This guy
seems like a Boy Scout.</i>

12:21.786 --> 12:25.176
He's in his bedroom.
He's on his computer.

12:28.613 --> 12:31.840
<i>I take that back.
Josh is definitely not a Boy Scout.</i>

12:31.865 --> 12:34.005
He has a hidden camera
in his living room.

12:34.030 --> 12:36.003
<i>He's watching Abby undress.</i>

12:36.028 --> 12:38.289
- What a creep.
- What a creep.

12:38.314 --> 12:41.207
How charming. The
senator's son is a perv.

12:41.380 --> 12:45.285
Hold it. How could you
know what Josh saw?

12:47.546 --> 12:49.144
I was in his apartment.

12:49.169 --> 12:52.804
<i>I drew certain conclusions.</i>

12:54.068 --> 12:56.335
Kirsten: <i>It jumped again.</i>

12:56.360 --> 13:00.155
The lech is checking his camera.

13:09.383 --> 13:12.451
(phone dinging)

13:12.820 --> 13:16.588
<i>He just got a ZipCouch
message from Denise Buchwald.</i>

13:16.624 --> 13:19.137
That's the woman he was expecting
last night... the fake profile.

13:19.162 --> 13:21.704
- Death moment in 20 seconds.
- Maybe he taped his own murder.

13:21.729 --> 13:24.153
Is the camera recording?

13:27.500 --> 13:29.338
He hasn't switched it on yet.

13:29.363 --> 13:32.622
- Yo, what...
- (firing)

13:33.740 --> 13:35.340
- Make the bounce.
- (beeping)

13:35.365 --> 13:37.945
That's insane. A hit man?

13:37.970 --> 13:40.583
The killer was wearing
a clean-room suit.

13:40.608 --> 13:42.378
He left no DNA evidence behind.

13:42.403 --> 13:44.519
- Seems like a professional.
- So how did you catch him?

13:44.544 --> 13:48.071
We haven't. He's still out there.

13:49.177 --> 13:53.598
(no discernible dialog)

14:02.680 --> 14:05.519
Is it safe to eat this?

14:05.544 --> 14:07.345
Oh, yeah, that's Camille.

14:07.370 --> 14:10.031
She's my roommate.
She's trying to teach me boundaries,

14:10.235 --> 14:12.989
which is funny, 'cause
I bought that cheese.

14:13.243 --> 14:17.012
Ah, there, I knew we had olives.

14:18.018 --> 14:20.139
Do olives go bad?

14:20.164 --> 14:22.464
I don't know.

14:22.489 --> 14:24.454
I'm into take-out. By
the time I get home,

14:24.479 --> 14:27.028
- I am too wiped to cook.
- What do you do?

14:27.053 --> 14:29.190
I teach elementary school kids

14:29.215 --> 14:31.509
the wonders of the computer.

14:31.534 --> 14:34.305
Really? You're a computer teacher?

14:34.330 --> 14:37.479
Not as exciting as the NSA,

14:37.504 --> 14:39.166
but my students are great.

14:39.191 --> 14:42.603
And computers have always been my thing.

14:42.628 --> 14:44.247
Mine too.

14:44.272 --> 14:46.306
Guess we get that from our father.

14:47.575 --> 14:49.355
How often do you see him?

14:49.380 --> 14:52.048
How often do you use his technology?

14:52.073 --> 14:55.207
I wasn't fishing, just curious.

14:55.232 --> 14:57.254
Right.

14:57.279 --> 15:00.145
How about moving forward, we both agree

15:00.170 --> 15:02.109
to not think the other is an idiot.

15:02.246 --> 15:03.679
Agreed.

15:03.704 --> 15:07.083
Look, I just want to know
more about you and Stinger.

15:07.108 --> 15:09.953
It's a relationship I
never had, you know?

15:09.979 --> 15:14.038
I was very young when he left
me and my mother for Jacqueline.

15:14.062 --> 15:15.260
Mmm, he has a history of leaving.

15:15.285 --> 15:16.979
I hated him for it.

15:17.039 --> 15:18.991
Now I guess you could say

15:19.016 --> 15:21.914
we picked up where we left off.

15:22.394 --> 15:26.691
So what should we drink to?

15:27.254 --> 15:30.749
To more answers than questions.

15:30.774 --> 15:34.037
To more answers than questions.

15:34.062 --> 15:36.732
Here's a question...
who would write something like this...

15:36.757 --> 15:38.254
"The ZipCouch app is crap.

15:38.279 --> 15:40.868
"ZipCouch would let Charles
Manson be your host.

15:40.893 --> 15:43.469
- Use at your own risk"?
- An unhappy subscriber.

15:43.494 --> 15:46.094
And clearly someone who's not a
fan of the guy who created the app.

15:46.119 --> 15:49.639
"Nick Mero is money-grubbing scum.
He needs to suffer and die."

15:49.664 --> 15:51.798
An unhappy subscriber with a vendetta.

15:51.823 --> 15:54.385
Possible whoever posted those
took things to the next level.

15:54.409 --> 15:57.577
This is a dummy account. If these
reviews are from the same IP address

15:57.602 --> 16:01.036
as the fake account used by the killer,
we'll know they're connected.

16:01.080 --> 16:03.346
Camille's also my coworker.

16:03.371 --> 16:06.572
That normal...
for NSA agents to live together?

16:06.597 --> 16:09.325
Our relationship isn't exactly normal.

16:10.058 --> 16:14.261
She, uh,
spied on me to recruit me to the NSA.

16:14.286 --> 16:15.892
Lovely.

16:16.364 --> 16:20.269
Do you have any normal
relationships in your life?

16:20.493 --> 16:24.127
Right. Well, actually,
Camille might be tough,

16:24.152 --> 16:26.132
but I can always count on her

16:26.157 --> 16:28.757
and everyone else that I work with.

16:28.782 --> 16:30.338
We're like family.

16:30.363 --> 16:33.536
Okay, thanks.

16:34.010 --> 16:36.039
My dad's surgery got pushed again.

16:36.064 --> 16:38.896
Are you kidding me? How many
emergencies can one surgeon have?

16:38.920 --> 16:40.184
I'm so sorry, Linus.

16:40.209 --> 16:43.054
I just want to get it over with
so he can start getting better.

16:43.080 --> 16:45.346
You know what you need right now?

16:45.371 --> 16:46.537
Really?

16:46.562 --> 16:49.284
Comfort food, numbnuts.

16:49.309 --> 16:51.866
Come on. Let's go crush some
chocolate in the break room.

16:53.192 --> 16:56.742
Hey, have you heard from Nina?

16:56.767 --> 16:58.694
No, still radio silence.

16:58.718 --> 17:00.760
I mean, what do I do?
I've texted a zillion times.

17:00.785 --> 17:02.562
I went by the store last night.
She wasn't there.

17:02.588 --> 17:05.502
Maybe she senses there's more to
your work than you're telling her.

17:05.728 --> 17:08.079
Yeah, speaking of work,

17:08.104 --> 17:10.501
um, when were you going
to tell me about Liam?

17:10.526 --> 17:12.843
Well, I haven't seen
Liam since I caught him

17:12.867 --> 17:15.229
groping Camille in my kitchen.

17:15.252 --> 17:17.067
He might be linked to my father.

17:17.093 --> 17:20.490
Okay. But, I mean, you could have
at least told me he was around.

17:20.515 --> 17:22.134
I tried.

17:22.157 --> 17:24.167
I did. You're always
running off with Nina.

17:24.194 --> 17:25.852
I thought you were
okay with me and Nina?

17:25.877 --> 17:28.547
- I was.
- Was?

17:29.735 --> 17:31.581
Uh, am.

17:31.606 --> 17:35.852
Am. I told you I was... am.

17:35.877 --> 17:38.619
I'm gonna get into my stitch suit.

17:38.644 --> 17:40.178
Okay.

17:40.203 --> 17:41.907
- It's fine.
- Right.

17:41.932 --> 17:43.682
Oh, I see.

17:43.707 --> 17:46.584
So there is something going
on between you and Cameron.

17:46.609 --> 17:48.254
Oh, uh, no.

17:48.279 --> 17:51.594
I'm not focused on other
relationships right now.

17:51.619 --> 17:53.088
I just need to find my father.

17:53.502 --> 17:56.370
That's your whole life, huh?

17:57.101 --> 17:58.934
Sad.

18:03.362 --> 18:05.550
Let me show you something.

18:25.946 --> 18:28.914
I know we just met,

18:28.939 --> 18:32.057
but should I be worried about you?

18:37.565 --> 18:39.367
Everything in the universe

18:39.392 --> 18:41.480
can be broken down mathematically.

18:41.505 --> 18:45.110
Even finding a man you
haven't seen in years?

18:45.135 --> 18:47.870
Unlike him, math has never let me down.

18:48.033 --> 18:51.449
Each piece of evidence
is tied to an equation

18:51.474 --> 18:53.699
that will eventually lead me to Stinger.

18:54.004 --> 18:55.637
What if I tell you first?

18:55.662 --> 18:58.677
Where's that possibility on the wall?

19:01.361 --> 19:03.224
Here.

19:07.889 --> 19:11.896
An equally-likely outcomes formula.

19:13.001 --> 19:15.224
You're smart, Kirsten Clark.

19:15.249 --> 19:18.078
Apparently you know statistics too,
Ivy Brown.

19:18.102 --> 19:20.562
- I like numbers.
- Me too.

19:21.609 --> 19:24.994
But they haven't led me to him yet.

19:27.650 --> 19:31.733
You ever think you're so desperate
to find him because you miss him?

19:35.860 --> 19:38.408
What's he like?

19:39.112 --> 19:41.088
He's really smart,

19:41.113 --> 19:44.156
driven, relentless.

19:44.181 --> 19:45.774
A lot like you.

19:45.799 --> 19:48.775
- Really?
- It's not a bad thing.

19:48.800 --> 19:51.580
It took me a long time to figure out,

19:51.827 --> 19:55.261
but I think everything he's
done is motivated by love.

19:55.297 --> 19:57.863
Huh? Abandoning us? Murder?

19:57.899 --> 19:59.899
That's a crazy kind of love.

20:02.770 --> 20:06.372
What's with the baseball cap?

20:06.408 --> 20:10.645
It represents the
informant I told you about.

20:13.194 --> 20:16.179
I'm in the ZipCouch offices.

20:17.676 --> 20:21.136
Hey! There he is.

20:21.335 --> 20:23.409
- I'm Nick.
- Josh.

20:23.434 --> 20:26.078
Nice to meet you.

20:29.008 --> 20:31.632
- Hi, Kirsten.
- We got the anomaly again.

20:31.657 --> 20:34.108
- Kirsten, what's going on?
- Uh, it looks like Nick

20:34.133 --> 20:36.734
cut some kind of deal with
Josh to be a VIP host.

20:36.769 --> 20:38.336
No, no, no, not that. The anomaly.

20:38.371 --> 20:39.570
We're seeing it on our end.

20:39.606 --> 20:42.096
Erecting a firewall to isolate it.

20:42.121 --> 20:44.283
I never thanked you for
helping me out of the void.

20:44.307 --> 20:46.051
Helping you is why I'm here.

20:46.076 --> 20:47.236
Who are you?

20:47.261 --> 20:49.467
- (static)
- I want to tell you. I really do.

20:49.492 --> 20:51.481
Wait, what was that?

20:54.152 --> 20:56.122
- Linus.
- Firewall is up.

20:56.147 --> 20:59.191
- Box it in.
- As we speak.

21:00.074 --> 21:02.178
- Damn it.
- What happened?

21:02.203 --> 21:04.736
The rogue signal is putting
up a bigger firewall.

21:04.776 --> 21:06.577
(alarm sounding)

21:06.854 --> 21:08.520
The time for secrets is almost over.

21:08.545 --> 21:09.872
Talk to me, Kirsten.

21:09.897 --> 21:11.550
Everything in your life has been a test.

21:11.575 --> 21:12.858
Kirsten: <i>A test?</i>

21:12.883 --> 21:15.857
Someone's going to visit you to
ask a very specific question.

21:16.529 --> 21:20.030
Your answer will show if
you're ready to hear the truth.

21:20.055 --> 21:23.255
Kirsten, still with me?

21:23.280 --> 21:25.568
Uh, yeah.

21:25.896 --> 21:30.121
You keep asking about the
technology our father developed.

21:31.798 --> 21:33.765
Is this the test?

21:33.790 --> 21:35.474
What test?

21:35.999 --> 21:39.232
Um, no, I was just
thinking about the case.

21:39.257 --> 21:41.491
What exactly is the vetting
process for your hosts?

21:41.516 --> 21:44.618
It's a mix of social-network scrubbing,
background checks,

21:44.643 --> 21:46.543
credit-worthiness. We're super careful.

21:46.568 --> 21:49.907
- Obviously not careful enough.
- This is awful.

21:49.932 --> 21:51.766
Josh was a great guy.

21:51.940 --> 21:53.206
I mean, I thought he was.

21:53.241 --> 21:55.274
I even made him a VIP host.

21:55.310 --> 21:57.614
I thought the publicity
would really help ZipCouch.

21:57.639 --> 22:00.956
Once the press gets wind of this...

22:00.981 --> 22:03.398
I mean, Josh was a senator's son.

22:03.636 --> 22:06.294
Do you have any idea who
could have done this to him?

22:06.319 --> 22:08.848
Well, there are some pretty
harsh posts by one of your users.

22:08.873 --> 22:11.878
From a fake profile that was
directed at you personally.

22:12.091 --> 22:14.225
Having troubles with anyone lately?

22:14.260 --> 22:16.961
You think someone would have
killed Josh to get to me?

22:16.996 --> 22:18.763
Just covering all angles.

22:18.799 --> 22:20.832
No problems with anyone that I know of.

22:20.867 --> 22:24.969
So when does the press get
informed about the murder?

22:25.004 --> 22:27.872
It's an ongoing investigation,
so we're keeping it quiet for now.

22:27.907 --> 22:30.607
Good. I own 50% of ZipCouch.

22:30.643 --> 22:33.176
I sank my entire life
savings into this venture.

22:33.212 --> 22:35.145
If this gets out before
I get in front of it,

22:35.180 --> 22:36.862
I don't just lose my money,
but so do my investors.

22:36.887 --> 22:38.264
Heartless much?

22:38.289 --> 22:40.690
Well,
it's like Pacino said in <i> The Godfather.</i>

22:40.715 --> 22:44.149
"It's not personal.
It's strictly business."

22:44.323 --> 22:48.057
Plus it'll give me some time to get
some security measures in place.

22:48.092 --> 22:49.726
So not so heartless.

22:49.761 --> 22:51.334
I'm gonna get a head start on this.

22:51.359 --> 22:53.532
- You guys can see yourselves out?
- Sure.

22:59.270 --> 23:02.163
Okay, look, I've seen <i> The Godfather,</i>
like, 14 times.

23:02.188 --> 23:03.815
You know what the one thing
that stuck with me was?

23:03.840 --> 23:04.444
What?

23:04.469 --> 23:07.504
The mobsters were the only ones
who thought they were the heroes.

23:09.749 --> 23:13.258
Guys are so into the
whole <i> Godfather</i> thing.

23:13.283 --> 23:14.649
I don't get it.

23:14.674 --> 23:17.983
Cameron's into the <i> Godfather</i>
thing and every other movie ever.

23:18.008 --> 23:20.300
He watched a lot of them as a kid

23:20.325 --> 23:21.571
after he had heart surgery.

23:21.967 --> 23:23.601
So where were we?

23:23.626 --> 23:26.763
Um, Nick Mero... He
said he had no enemies?

23:26.788 --> 23:28.721
Yeah, but we found one.

23:28.746 --> 23:30.446
Meet Jessica Gray,

23:30.471 --> 23:32.577
founder and CEO of Futon Friends,

23:32.602 --> 23:34.261
ZipCouch's #1 rival.

23:34.286 --> 23:36.185
Remember all those nasty
posts about ZipCouch?

23:36.210 --> 23:37.947
I traced the IP address to her.

23:37.972 --> 23:40.223
Now there's someone who might
want to sink Nick's company.

23:40.248 --> 23:42.742
By having one of his hosts murdered?
Seems like overkill.

23:42.778 --> 23:44.811
- (chuckling)
- So to speak.

23:44.846 --> 23:47.164
Miss Gray is on a flight
in from San Francisco.

23:47.189 --> 23:48.522
She should land within the hour.

23:48.547 --> 23:50.420
Okay, as soon as she gets in,
bring her here.

23:50.445 --> 23:52.844
(phone chimes)

23:58.281 --> 24:01.466
- Where you going?
- I'll be back soon.

24:04.743 --> 24:07.011
Kirsten, hold up.

24:07.036 --> 24:08.931
Liam?

24:08.956 --> 24:10.597
He wants to meet me.

24:10.622 --> 24:12.684
- Maggie and Blair...
- I have to do this.

24:12.708 --> 24:14.957
Wait, what's the endgame?

24:15.443 --> 24:17.476
I find Stinger.

24:17.501 --> 24:20.536
I convince him to give himself up.

24:20.561 --> 24:22.893
Look, he's my father.

24:22.918 --> 24:24.934
No matter what, I love him.

24:24.959 --> 24:28.478
You said that? Really?

24:29.522 --> 24:31.063
What's the endgame?

24:31.088 --> 24:33.095
I find Stinger, bring him to justice.

24:33.120 --> 24:34.758
He deserves to burn for what he's done.

24:34.783 --> 24:36.866
Really? You'll arrest your own father?

24:36.892 --> 24:39.792
You think you'll be able to do
that when you see him face to face?

24:39.817 --> 24:42.033
You are losing yourself.

24:42.058 --> 24:44.717
You are feeding every bit of
your soul to this obsession

24:44.742 --> 24:47.890
and you are risking everything
and everyone who cares about you.

24:48.634 --> 24:51.195
Until I find my father,

24:51.220 --> 24:53.432
until I look him in the eyes

24:53.457 --> 24:56.692
and I know in my heart
that I am not him,

24:56.716 --> 25:00.050
I'm no good to anyone.

25:12.378 --> 25:16.246
♪ You act like your father ♪

25:16.271 --> 25:19.687
♪ But you look like your mother... ♪

25:19.713 --> 25:22.653
Oh, yeah, don't touch
that. That's Ed Clark.

25:23.516 --> 25:24.976
Ed Clark's in there.

25:25.001 --> 25:27.967
Oh. Sorry, Ed.

25:30.196 --> 25:33.352
So who's the guy you ran off to see?

25:33.377 --> 25:37.812
My ex... ex-almost fiancé, actually.

25:37.915 --> 25:41.869
I only met with him because
I had some questions

25:41.894 --> 25:43.328
that needed answers.

25:43.353 --> 25:44.727
Closure?

25:44.752 --> 25:45.964
Hopefully.

25:45.989 --> 25:49.083
I was pretty direct with him.

25:53.660 --> 25:56.154
Kirsten, I'm so glad you wanted to meet.

25:56.179 --> 25:57.945
- It's been...
- Uh, cut the crap, Liam.

25:57.970 --> 26:00.818
Okay? I know you're working for
my father to keep tabs on me.

26:00.843 --> 26:03.437
Your father?

26:03.462 --> 26:05.661
Please, just no more lies.

26:05.809 --> 26:07.633
Stinger's wanted for murder.

26:07.658 --> 26:10.525
If you're working with him or
you know anything about him

26:10.550 --> 26:12.556
that you're not reporting,
that makes you an accessory.

26:12.581 --> 26:15.370
Look, I'm sorry,
I don't know what you're talking about.

26:15.982 --> 26:19.282
I know you know where he is.

26:20.851 --> 26:24.005
If I ever meant anything to you,

26:24.866 --> 26:27.873
if there was ever a
shred of feeling for me

26:27.898 --> 26:31.766
before he got to you,
please tell me where he is.

26:35.259 --> 26:37.225
Please.

26:41.105 --> 26:43.873
So, did you get the closure you wanted?

26:43.898 --> 26:46.632
Not yet, but soon, I hope.

26:47.032 --> 26:49.099
(no discernible dialog)

27:02.612 --> 27:05.033
Just in time. Jessica Gray is here.

27:05.058 --> 27:06.991
- (phone pinging)
- Hold on.

27:08.535 --> 27:10.375
Now what?

27:10.400 --> 27:13.741
Nothing. I'm good, really.

27:14.016 --> 27:15.482
Ahem.

27:15.507 --> 27:20.419
Elizabeth Brown and my
father had a daughter, Ivy.

27:20.444 --> 27:22.768
I'm meeting my sister tonight.

27:22.793 --> 27:24.359
Blair might have something
to say about that.

27:24.384 --> 27:26.903
Not if you don't tell him.

27:28.235 --> 27:31.436
Damn right I posted
those negative reviews.

27:31.461 --> 27:33.288
ZipCouch is a poorly-designed app

27:33.313 --> 27:36.347
created by a hack who stole
all of his best ideas from me.

27:36.372 --> 27:38.272
Tell us how you really
feel about Nick Mero.

27:38.297 --> 27:40.726
- He's a loser.
- His business is booming.

27:40.751 --> 27:42.556
Right, for now.

27:42.580 --> 27:45.056
ZipCouch is his fifth
start-up in eight years.

27:45.082 --> 27:46.803
He's a serial entrepreneur.

27:46.827 --> 27:48.484
But isn't that what all
you start-up people do?

27:48.510 --> 27:50.176
Create one tech company after the next?

27:50.201 --> 27:52.191
Yeah, but we want them to succeed,

27:52.216 --> 27:54.087
not go belly-up in the first few months.

27:54.112 --> 27:55.670
Maybe he just had some bad luck.

27:56.019 --> 27:58.422
You know what real bad luck is?

27:58.447 --> 28:00.837
When an investor I've
been courting for months

28:00.862 --> 28:03.558
backs out on me 'cause
Nick Mero stole him.

28:03.583 --> 28:06.631
Nick stole one of your investors?

28:06.656 --> 28:08.823
Not one of them... "the" one.

28:08.848 --> 28:10.112
Caleb Jenkins.

28:10.137 --> 28:12.538
Deep pockets, majorly connected.

28:12.563 --> 28:15.452
In fact, he reached out to me recently.

28:15.477 --> 28:17.096
About what?

28:17.121 --> 28:20.318
So Caleb Jenkins told Jessica
that he regretted investing

28:20.343 --> 28:21.949
in ZipCouch instead of her app

28:21.975 --> 28:24.402
and he promised to infuse
her company with millions

28:24.426 --> 28:26.559
once he got his money
back from Nick Mero.

28:26.584 --> 28:30.353
I read that the biggest disrupters
in the world are sex and money.

28:30.378 --> 28:33.826
Do you think it's possible
an unhappy investor

28:33.851 --> 28:37.186
would hire a hitman to
damage ZipCouch's reputation

28:37.211 --> 28:39.445
and force the CEO to
pay him what he's owed?

28:39.470 --> 28:41.111
You think like an investigator.

28:41.136 --> 28:42.588
Or a criminal.

28:42.613 --> 28:44.979
Fisher always says that
I need to think like both

28:45.004 --> 28:47.438
- to solve a crime.
- Is that how you found Jenkins?

28:47.463 --> 28:49.273
Yeah.

28:49.297 --> 28:51.096
We paid him a visit.

28:51.121 --> 28:52.742
What did he say?

28:52.767 --> 28:55.000
He wasn't in a talking mood.

29:00.027 --> 29:03.138
Caleb Jenkins was shot
twice in the chest.

29:03.163 --> 29:07.212
I don't know how you
deal with so much death.

29:08.237 --> 29:13.034
(sighs) We... just
focus on the victims...

29:13.605 --> 29:15.960
try to get them the
justice they deserve.

29:15.985 --> 29:17.885
Using Dad's technology.

29:19.088 --> 29:22.191
It's like you speak for the dead.

29:27.125 --> 29:28.951
So once ZipCouch started making money

29:28.976 --> 29:30.574
Caleb wanted his cut, but got killed.

29:30.599 --> 29:32.398
By the same guy who killed Josh?

29:32.544 --> 29:34.193
Yet to be determined.

29:34.218 --> 29:36.018
- Communications.
- Go.

29:36.043 --> 29:37.476
- Medical.
- Go.

29:37.501 --> 29:38.728
Sound check, one-two, one-two.

29:38.753 --> 29:41.020
- Excuse me? Sound check?
- Yeah, we in a band?

29:41.045 --> 29:42.581
You make one mistake.

29:42.606 --> 29:45.192
Induce stitch neurosync on my mark.

29:45.217 --> 29:47.184
In three, two, one...

29:47.209 --> 29:50.151
(whirring)

29:56.295 --> 29:59.434
Caleb's with Nick. He looks pissed.

29:59.459 --> 30:01.782
We are the #1 app in the nation.

30:01.807 --> 30:04.006
I have 75% of this company

30:04.031 --> 30:05.864
and I still haven't seen a dime.

30:07.899 --> 30:10.305
Believe me, I want to
see those profits too,

30:10.330 --> 30:12.162
but ZipCouch just took off.

30:12.187 --> 30:14.654
ZipCouch is blowing up,
but Nick hasn't paid Caleb anything.

30:14.679 --> 30:16.887
These apps take time to monetize.

30:16.912 --> 30:20.501
Sure, just like the time it took
for TravelGuide and HikerGang...

30:20.526 --> 30:22.555
Your other failed ventures.

30:23.491 --> 30:26.382
Caleb dug up dirt on Nick.

30:28.848 --> 30:30.787
I... I don't know who
you've been talking to...

30:30.812 --> 30:32.701
You lied to me.

30:32.726 --> 30:34.836
You led me to believe that I was backing

30:34.861 --> 30:37.043
not just a winning
app, but a winning CEO.

30:37.068 --> 30:38.777
Turns out that you have a bad habit

30:38.802 --> 30:40.580
of losing your investors' money.

30:40.604 --> 30:44.419
I want my scheduled pay-outs now.

30:44.444 --> 30:47.901
Nick just accused Caleb of scamming him.
He wants his money now.

30:47.926 --> 30:51.154
Two weeks... That's all I need.

30:51.576 --> 30:54.679
I promise.

30:57.405 --> 30:59.707
Okay, another memory.

31:06.393 --> 31:08.206
I'm bouncing.

31:12.575 --> 31:15.333
And that's the last thing that
happened before you got here.

31:15.358 --> 31:17.212
You're all caught up.

31:17.238 --> 31:19.183
(doorbell rings)

31:19.973 --> 31:23.967
(soft music playing)

31:30.968 --> 31:32.335
I shouldn't have come.

31:32.360 --> 31:35.223
Oh, come on, this is like when
Luke Cage iced out Jessica Jones,

31:35.249 --> 31:38.160
except we don't have that mind-control
freak to bring us back together.

31:38.185 --> 31:41.262
I'm clearly upset and you
want to reference comic books?

31:41.984 --> 31:44.144
Sorry.

31:44.621 --> 31:46.707
You want to come in?

31:56.560 --> 31:59.205
Nice of them to take so long.

31:59.230 --> 32:01.522
It's not like I'm dying or anything.

32:01.547 --> 32:04.165
- Samir.
- You're not dying, baba.

32:04.190 --> 32:06.657
You're gonna get better
and live to a ripe old age.

32:06.692 --> 32:07.892
You got it?

32:07.927 --> 32:09.994
Knock, knock.

32:10.019 --> 32:12.014
- Camille!
- Hi.

32:12.039 --> 32:13.823
Come in, come in.

32:13.848 --> 32:17.181
Camille, we've missed you.

32:17.206 --> 32:19.844
- Oh, right back at you.
- (laughs)

32:19.869 --> 32:22.226
- Don't you have to be at work?
- Work shmerk!

32:22.252 --> 32:24.151
I had to bring this player a treat

32:24.176 --> 32:27.262
- before he went under the knife.
<i>- Gulab jamun!</i>

32:27.287 --> 32:29.320
Just popped over to India to
get them for you. No big deal.

32:29.345 --> 32:31.712
You are a ray of sunshine.

32:31.984 --> 32:36.118
- Getti, just a nibble?
- After the surgery.

32:36.143 --> 32:37.554
We'll call it incentive.

32:37.579 --> 32:41.147
Mr. Ahluwalia? We're ready for you.

32:41.172 --> 32:43.936
- Finally.
- Getti?

32:43.961 --> 32:48.030
Don't worry.
As long as there is <i> gulab jamun,</i>

32:48.065 --> 32:49.965
I'll be fine.

32:50.001 --> 32:54.169
- He's gonna be okay.
- Getti: I know.

32:58.005 --> 33:00.287
I love you, baba.

33:00.750 --> 33:03.010
See you later!

33:08.221 --> 33:11.789
(crying) Damn. I didn't want to do this.

33:11.814 --> 33:14.147
It's okay.

33:16.591 --> 33:19.226
Some man I turned out to be.

33:21.432 --> 33:25.180
You've never been more of a
man than you are right now.

33:33.432 --> 33:35.833
Someone leaked the
Langston case to the press.

33:35.858 --> 33:37.591
I thought we were keeping
a tight lid on this one?

33:37.616 --> 33:39.416
We were. Where is everyone else?

33:39.606 --> 33:41.405
Well,
Cameron's dealing with girlfriend issues

33:41.430 --> 33:43.362
and Camille is with
Linus at the hospital.

33:43.387 --> 33:45.153
And Kirsten?

33:46.130 --> 33:49.966
So it's the end of the wine
and the end of the story.

33:49.991 --> 33:51.857
There isn't much left to say,

33:51.882 --> 33:53.945
except what we both want to hear.

33:54.063 --> 33:55.899
True.

33:56.835 --> 33:58.210
So...

34:00.303 --> 34:01.960
tell me where my father is.

34:01.985 --> 34:05.365
Look, I can't say I didn't
enjoy hearing about your case

34:05.390 --> 34:07.258
and the people you work with,

34:07.355 --> 34:10.891
but unless you think someone else

34:10.916 --> 34:14.373
is going to show up and
tell you how to find him,

34:14.478 --> 34:16.610
stop playing games

34:16.636 --> 34:20.458
and tell me what his technology is.

34:30.725 --> 34:33.634
(phone chiming)

34:33.658 --> 34:35.755
Hold on.

34:38.454 --> 34:40.320
It's Fisher.

34:42.210 --> 34:44.105
Hey, what's up?

34:44.130 --> 34:46.331
Sorry to interrupt.
ZipCouch murders went public.

34:46.366 --> 34:48.065
- How?
- Hell if I know.

34:48.101 --> 34:50.601
Nick Mero just announced ZipCouch
is shutting down immediately.

34:50.636 --> 34:52.870
He's holding a press conference
at his offices in a half hour.

34:52.895 --> 34:54.728
Okay, I'll meet you there.

34:55.764 --> 34:58.192
Uh, I have to go.

34:58.217 --> 35:00.449
The ZipCouch murders just
got leaked to the press.

35:00.474 --> 35:01.798
I thought it was confidential.

35:01.823 --> 35:02.922
Yeah, so did I.

35:02.947 --> 35:04.727
Nick Mero is closing down his company.

35:04.753 --> 35:07.632
So much for his life savings.

35:08.824 --> 35:13.486
Wait, Nick Mero says that
he owns 50% of ZipCouch.

35:13.511 --> 35:18.481
But Caleb Jenkins bought a 75% stake.

35:19.726 --> 35:22.565
I need your computer.

35:23.538 --> 35:26.063
Uh, okay.

35:34.485 --> 35:36.306
What are you doing?

35:36.331 --> 35:40.068
Accessing Nick's financial records.

35:41.024 --> 35:43.412
Uh, his secure financial records.

35:43.437 --> 35:45.898
Are you sure you're just an
elementary-school computer teacher?

35:45.923 --> 35:49.227
I worked in banking before teaching.

35:49.253 --> 35:52.072
Let's see.

35:53.259 --> 35:55.808
Check it out.

35:57.891 --> 36:01.589
Hi. Good evening. I'm Nick Mero.

36:01.614 --> 36:04.373
And I built ZipCouch on
the principles of kindness,

36:04.398 --> 36:06.821
hospitality and trust among strangers,

36:06.846 --> 36:09.446
Unfortunately,
the murder of Senator Langston's son

36:09.471 --> 36:12.741
means I can no longer assure
the safety of our users.

36:12.766 --> 36:15.550
And so, despite its success,

36:15.576 --> 36:19.312
as of midnight,
I'll be taking ZipCouch offline.

36:19.337 --> 36:20.835
Any questions?

36:20.859 --> 36:23.318
I have one.

36:24.337 --> 36:27.208
Will your investors
get their money back?

36:27.233 --> 36:29.997
Uh, you're not with a news agency.

36:30.022 --> 36:32.319
Answer her question.

36:32.840 --> 36:35.612
Ahem. Investing has risks.

36:35.637 --> 36:38.648
And unfortunately,
in light of the circumstances,

36:38.673 --> 36:41.299
our valuation will
undoubtedly drop to zero.

36:41.325 --> 36:43.001
There is nothing to return.

36:43.026 --> 36:44.992
That's all for now. Thank you.

36:45.017 --> 36:46.711
How is that possible?

36:46.736 --> 36:49.126
You lined up 26 different investors

36:49.151 --> 36:51.205
and funded the company at 3,000%

36:51.230 --> 36:54.571
- of what you told everyone you needed.
- That's not true.

36:54.596 --> 36:56.144
You raised more money than you needed

36:56.169 --> 36:57.588
so that when the company failed,

36:57.613 --> 36:59.605
which you actually wanted it to,

36:59.631 --> 37:00.825
you could keep it.

37:00.850 --> 37:02.544
Don't believe everything...

37:02.568 --> 37:04.700
Only something happened
that you didn't expect...

37:04.725 --> 37:07.135
ZipCouch took off.
And when one of your investors

37:07.160 --> 37:09.153
came looking for his
share of the profits,

37:09.178 --> 37:11.712
the only way out for you
was to sabotage the app.

37:11.737 --> 37:13.914
Kill a host, and then kill an investor

37:13.940 --> 37:15.406
who was getting too close to the truth.

37:15.431 --> 37:18.990
Then leak it to the press so the bad
publicity justifies closing down the app.

37:21.110 --> 37:23.375
Nick Mero, you're under arrest.

37:23.400 --> 37:26.384
(all chattering)

37:26.588 --> 37:30.074
I hear the sharing economy
is booming in prison.

37:30.099 --> 37:34.802
(chattering continues)

37:37.042 --> 37:41.984
You and me were more than a
hook-up or a fling or whatever.

37:42.009 --> 37:46.313
I know because I'm usually planning
my exit strategy right about now.

37:47.155 --> 37:49.277
But I want more from you.

37:49.302 --> 37:51.296
Okay, then don't run away.

37:51.967 --> 37:53.727
It's pretty clear you and Kirsten

37:53.752 --> 37:56.287
have something... special.

37:56.312 --> 37:58.622
- We're just...
- I get it, she's amazing.

37:58.647 --> 38:00.647
I get it. But you know what?

38:00.703 --> 38:02.737
I am too.

38:03.475 --> 38:06.145
And I will not be second best.

38:07.212 --> 38:08.841
You need to make a choice.

38:09.524 --> 38:12.024
The girl in your mind...

38:12.632 --> 38:15.199
or the girl standing in front of you.

38:22.890 --> 38:24.689
Look, honestly,

38:25.082 --> 38:28.775
I was freaking out all day thinking that
you weren't going to talk to me again.

38:28.800 --> 38:31.768
But this conversation that we're having

38:31.793 --> 38:33.896
right now... it's real.

38:33.921 --> 38:36.062
And it's... it's open.

38:36.087 --> 38:40.089
And I never realized before
how much I needed that.

38:46.694 --> 38:48.394
Uh-huh.

38:48.555 --> 38:50.188
Okay, thank you.

38:51.885 --> 38:54.748
They just found a dozen
unused clean suits

38:54.773 --> 38:56.796
in Nick Mero's storage unit.

38:56.821 --> 38:58.869
Who knows how many more
users he would have killed

38:58.895 --> 39:00.191
to put himself out of business?

39:00.216 --> 39:03.086
Impressive work. You
figured out his scam

39:03.111 --> 39:05.319
while finding time to dodge me.

39:05.344 --> 39:07.876
I'm a woman of many talents...

39:08.561 --> 39:12.324
just like my sister.

39:12.845 --> 39:15.798
Sister? Is that who that was?

39:15.823 --> 39:19.622
Half-sister. Daniel Stinger's
daughter with his first wife.

39:19.647 --> 39:24.040
I assume that you found her during
your unauthorized search for him?

39:24.065 --> 39:26.656
We'll deal with this in the morning.

39:26.681 --> 39:29.797
Okay.

39:39.358 --> 39:42.243
I didn't think meeting your
boss was the best thing.

39:42.268 --> 39:44.415
Yeah, you're probably right.

39:44.733 --> 39:46.789
Thank you for your help today.

39:46.814 --> 39:49.690
- (phone chiming)
- Damn.

39:51.075 --> 39:53.925
<i>- Kirsten.</i>
- Liam.

39:53.950 --> 39:56.351
I'll tell you everything you
need to know about your father.

39:56.376 --> 39:58.095
<i>Meet me.</i>

39:58.536 --> 40:01.476
- <i>I'll text you where.</i>
- (hangs up)

40:04.001 --> 40:05.926
(phone chimes)

40:05.951 --> 40:10.560
My ex-almost fiancé wants to talk.

40:10.585 --> 40:13.216
Think you're going to get the
answers you're looking for?

40:13.241 --> 40:17.579
Yeah. I do. I'm sorry,
I... I have to go.

40:17.604 --> 40:19.694
We still haven't shared our secrets.

40:19.719 --> 40:22.629
I know, but maybe we're forcing

40:22.654 --> 40:25.425
the whole trust thing for now.

40:25.449 --> 40:28.082
But can we get together again soon?

40:28.542 --> 40:30.243
That'd be nice.

40:30.518 --> 40:32.437
Okay.

40:34.172 --> 40:37.004
I'm not... I'm not really a hugger.

40:37.030 --> 40:38.390
Me neither.

40:38.415 --> 40:41.270
Okay. Look, we're bonding.

40:42.418 --> 40:46.488
Okay, bye.

40:57.919 --> 41:01.343
- (ringing)
- Liam: <i> Kirsten? Where are you?</i>

41:01.368 --> 41:03.468
I'm here. Where are you?

41:03.492 --> 41:04.761
<i>Yeah, I'm just around the corner.</i>

41:04.786 --> 41:06.642
<i>Stay where you are. I'll come to you.</i>

41:07.248 --> 41:09.342
<i>- Wait, no!
- (silenced gunshot)</i>

41:09.367 --> 41:11.234
Liam!

41:15.608 --> 41:17.721
Liam?
