I'M NOT GONNA LET THAT HAPPEN.

16:19.312 --> 16:20.845
                GOOD FOR YOU.

16:22.482 --> 16:26.951
       BIG THING IN A BOY'S LIFE
        WHEN HE FIRES A PARENT.

16:26.953 --> 16:29.087
     MY POP NEVER SAW IT COMING.

16:29.089 --> 16:33.491
       THAT WAS A GOOD BIRTHDAY.

16:33.493 --> 16:35.593
IT WASN'T FUN FOR ME, JACK.

16:35.595 --> 16:36.995
               WHAT WASN'T FUN?

16:36.997 --> 16:38.963
     FIRING HER.
 I DID IT YESTERDAY.

16:38.965 --> 16:40.665
                YOU DID WHAT?

16:40.667 --> 16:43.101
 GEORGE, YOU WEREN'T SUPPOSED TO
              ACTUALLY FIRE HER!

16:43.103 --> 16:44.535
JACK, YOU TOLD ME TO!

16:44.537 --> 16:46.304
            I FIGURED YOU'D COME
                SEE ME FIRST.

16:46.306 --> 16:49.440
          GEORGE, IT WAS A TEST.

16:49.442 --> 16:50.541
       A TEST?

16:50.543 --> 16:52.276
 ARE YOU CRAZY, JACK?

16:52.278 --> 16:55.680
THAT'S WHY I WORK IN A FACTORY.
I'M NO GOOD AT TESTS.

16:55.682 --> 16:57.382
                LISTEN TO ME.

16:57.384 --> 17:00.351
  YOU ARE THE FIRST MAN FROM THE
    LINE WHO EVER MADE MANAGER.

17:00.353 --> 17:02.153
     I WAS TESTING YOUR LOYALTY.

17:02.155 --> 17:05.156
I JUST WANTED TO SEE IF YOU WERE
  CAPABLE OF FIRING YOUR MOTHER.

17:05.157 --> 17:07.290
 OH, YOU WANT TO KNOW
 WHAT I'M CAPABLE OF?

17:07.292 --> 17:09.160
     HOW'S THIS?
       I QUIT!

17:09.162 --> 17:11.329
        OH, NO, GEORGE, COME ON.
                HEY, HEY, HEY!

17:11.330 --> 17:13.397
  YOU CAN'T LEAVE ME WITH NOBODY
              TO RUN THIS PLACE.

17:13.400 --> 17:14.732
   WATCH ME, JACK.

17:14.733 --> 17:17.167
                NO, NO, WAIT!

17:17.170 --> 17:19.237
    HOW CAN I MAKE IT UP TO YOU?

17:19.239 --> 17:21.339
SHUT DOWN BETWEEN CHRISTMAS
    AND NEW YEAR'S

17:21.340 --> 17:23.174
SO EVERYBODY CAN HAVE
      TIME OFF.

17:23.175 --> 17:25.076
                   NO WAY.

17:25.078 --> 17:27.078
                    NO WAY.

17:27.079 --> 17:29.247
      THAT WOULD COST A FORTUNE.

17:29.249 --> 17:32.150
 LET ME LET YOU IN ON
A LITTLE SECRET, JACK.

17:32.152 --> 17:34.218
WE DON'T WORK THAT WEEK
       ANYWAY.

17:34.220 --> 17:37.722
WE ALL JUST STAND AROUND TALKING
ABOUT WHAT AN S.O.B. YOU ARE.

17:39.225 --> 17:41.659
   ¶ FA-LA-LA-LA-LA
    LA-LA LA LA ¶

17:43.763 --> 17:46.864
           ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.

17:46.866 --> 17:48.266
       NOT YET.

17:48.268 --> 17:50.101
 I WANT TWO WEEKS OFF
      WITH PAY.

17:51.204 --> 17:53.371
    NOT FOR ME --
     FOR MY MOM.

17:53.373 --> 17:55.173
             NO PROBLEM, GEORGE.

17:55.175 --> 17:58.242
      I'LL GIVE HER THREE WEEKS.
              I DON'T LIKE HER.

18:00.180 --> 18:02.914
         HEY, CAN I HAVE
      EVERYONE'S ATTENTION?

18:02.916 --> 18:06.350
   LISTEN -- I KNOW YOU'VE ALL
   HEARD RUMORS ABOUT LAYOFFS,

18:06.352 --> 18:07.418
      BUT THEY'RE NOT TRUE.

18:07.420 --> 18:09.420
    ACTUALLY, I GOT GOOD NEWS.

18:09.422 --> 18:12.457
 FOR THE FIRST TIME IN 20 YEARS,
 EVERYONE'S GETTING THE WEEK OFF

18:12.459 --> 18:14.192
        BETWEEN CHRISTMAS
         AND NEW YEAR'S.

18:15.929 --> 18:17.295
            WITH PAY.

18:17.297 --> 18:18.696
           [ CHEERING ]

18:21.201 --> 18:24.068
      LUNCH AT THIRSTY'S --
       FIRST ROUND'S ON ME!

18:24.070 --> 18:25.269
           [ CHEERING ]

18:25.271 --> 18:26.404
                   I'M IN!

18:26.406 --> 18:28.573
      ALL RIGHT!
   GEORGE IS BACK!

18:28.575 --> 18:30.308
BUT IF I CATCH ANYBODY DRINKING,
                THEY'RE FIRED.

18:30.310 --> 18:34.879
  I STILL LIKE HIM,
BUT I'M DISAPPOINTED, GEORGE.

18:36.983 --> 18:39.383
                     SO?

18:39.385 --> 18:40.418
       SO WHAT?

18:40.420 --> 18:42.320
     SO, WHAT HAPPENED FOR REAL?

18:42.322 --> 18:44.622
       NOTHING.
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

18:44.624 --> 18:46.457
YOU GOT YOUR JOB BACK.
      BE HAPPY.

18:46.459 --> 18:49.760
  YOU COULDN'T PULL THE TRIGGER,
        COULD YOU, MR. GOOD GUY?

18:49.762 --> 18:51.963
       OH, MAN.

18:51.965 --> 18:53.831
   WHAT, DID YOU TAKE A PAY CUT?

18:53.833 --> 18:56.234
                 DID YOU BEG
           FOR MOMMY'S JOB BACK?

18:56.236 --> 18:57.468
   OKAY, THAT'S IT.

18:57.470 --> 18:59.070
YOU WANT IT, HERE IT IS.

18:59.072 --> 19:00.505
     I FIRED YOU.

19:00.507 --> 19:02.640
POWER'S WAS TESTING ME
TO SEE IF I COULD DO IT.

19:02.642 --> 19:05.076
             YOU DIDN'T FIRE ME.
     YES, I DID.

19:05.078 --> 19:08.479
MOM! I FIRED YOUR ASS!

19:09.649 --> 19:11.449
   LOOK IN MY EYES.

19:11.451 --> 19:13.484
YOU SAY YOU CAN ALWAYS TELL IF
I'M LYING BY LOOKING IN MY EYES.

19:13.486 --> 19:15.353
   WHAT DO YOU SEE?

19:15.355 --> 19:18.856
                YOU FIRED ME!

19:18.858 --> 19:20.458
      THANK YOU.

19:20.460 --> 19:23.794
         I'M GONNA SAY SOMETHING
            I NEVER SAID BEFORE.

19:23.796 --> 19:25.363
              I'M PROUD OF YOU.

19:25.365 --> 19:30.601
        YOU HAD THE GUTS TO FIRE
               YOUR OWN MOTHER.

19:30.603 --> 19:33.404
           THEY FINALLY DROPPED.

19:35.275 --> 19:37.675
YOU KNOW, THEY DON'T MAKE
    HALLMARK CARDS

19:37.677 --> 19:39.310
FOR PEOPLE LIKE US, MOM.

19:43.283 --> 19:45.216
  YOU KNOW, HONEY...

19:45.218 --> 19:47.618
I'M REALLY PROUD OF THE WAY
YOU HANDLED EVERYTHING.

19:47.620 --> 19:49.120
            OH, THANK YOU, BABY.

19:49.122 --> 19:51.322
HEY, HOW'S YOUR MOM ENJOYING
    HER VACATION?

19:51.324 --> 19:53.724
  I THINK SHE'S JUST HAPPY BEING
              OUT OF THE HOUSE.

19:53.726 --> 19:56.394
MAX HAD THAT BAD DREAM
        AGAIN.

19:56.396 --> 19:59.463
      GRANDMA WAS CHASING ME
          WITH A KNIFE.

20:00.400 --> 20:02.366
          All: AAAHHHH!

20:02.368 --> 20:04.268
         WHO WANTS CAKE?
