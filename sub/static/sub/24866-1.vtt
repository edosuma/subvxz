01:16.074 --> 01:17.343
<i>Thank you.</i>

01:19.475 --> 01:23.745
<i>I found a song
that saved me through a time.</i>

01:23.747 --> 01:27.116
<i>You know how music does that?</i>

01:27.118 --> 01:31.387
<i>I was dealing with loss,
with pain,</i>

01:31.389 --> 01:33.155
<i>and I heard this song,</i>

01:33.157 --> 01:36.625
<i>and it blew my soul
wide open.</i>

01:36.627 --> 01:40.762
<i>It became my anthem.
It rescued me.</i>

01:40.764 --> 01:45.768
<i>And I just kept wondering,
who could write this?</i>

01:45.770 --> 01:48.503
<i>What did they have
to go through</i>

01:48.505 --> 01:51.307
<i>to be able to give
this gift to me?</i>

01:51.309 --> 01:55.678
<i>This is hope, pure hope.</i>

01:55.680 --> 01:57.749
It's an amazing song.

02:00.785 --> 02:02.121
Just kind of happened.

02:04.255 --> 02:06.756
Lyrics took about ten minutes,
I guess.

02:06.758 --> 02:08.824
Music took about the same.

02:08.827 --> 02:14.229
Bart... you didn't write
this song in ten minutes.

02:14.231 --> 02:16.100
It took a lifetime.

02:20.337 --> 02:22.306
How'd you do this?

02:56.273 --> 02:59.174
Bart? Bart?!

03:00.712 --> 03:03.214
Well, mercy me,
you been out here all day!

03:06.783 --> 03:08.817
How'd I do?

03:08.819 --> 03:12.657
Oh, you done good, Bart.
You done real good.

03:15.159 --> 03:19.194
I'll see you tomorrow!
Bye!

it's... it's all about the song.

04:56.661 --> 04:58.260
- Yeah.
- Doesn't matter what band.

04:58.262 --> 04:59.895
You might be interested
in this band.

04:59.897 --> 05:01.731
It was one of the greatest
concerts I've ever seen.

05:01.733 --> 05:02.998
It was amazing.

Hey, hon.

06:10.435 --> 06:12.400
What you got there?

06:12.402 --> 06:14.804
It's a fighter helmet
that I made

06:14.806 --> 06:16.672
during a big battle in space.

06:16.674 --> 06:18.073
You sure worked hard on that,
didn't you?

06:18.075 --> 06:20.643
Yeah.

06:30.854 --> 06:33.789
- What's this?
- It's just... it's just junk.

06:33.791 --> 06:36.859
You're a dreamer, Bart.
That's good.

06:36.861 --> 06:39.027
Haven't you ever
imagined anything?

06:39.029 --> 06:41.397
I'm gonna teach you
something, Bart.

06:43.433 --> 06:47.503
Dreams don't pay the bills.
Nothing good comes from it.

06:49.474 --> 06:52.607
All it does...

06:52.609 --> 06:54.912
is keep you from all this.

06:57.614 --> 06:59.450
From knowing what's real.

07:01.585 --> 07:02.920
You understand that?

07:05.522 --> 07:09.157
- Huh?!
- Yes, Daddy.

07:09.159 --> 07:13.095
Well, you say that's
a piece of junk,

07:13.097 --> 07:14.966
why don't you just go
throw it away?

07:18.503 --> 07:20.503
Go, just go.
He'll take it.

07:20.505 --> 07:21.871
It's okay, it's okay.

07:43.794 --> 07:46.429
He's your son!
Stay out of it!

07:46.431 --> 07:48.963
It's none of your business!
It's between him and me.

07:48.965 --> 07:52.501
Someone's gotta make sure
that he is raised up right!

07:52.503 --> 07:55.804
Shut your mouth!!
Or I'll shut it for you!!

08:00.044 --> 08:02.945
You want some more?!
You want some more?!

08:02.947 --> 08:06.080
Here, had enough yet?!
Had enough yet?!

08:30.941 --> 08:33.842
Hey. Bart? Shh.

08:33.845 --> 08:36.244
It's okay. Hey.

08:36.246 --> 08:38.647
- Mom?
- Ready for an adventure?

08:38.649 --> 08:40.482
- Now?
- Yes, right now.

08:40.484 --> 08:43.551
It's called Camp Glorieta.

08:43.553 --> 08:45.153
Church down the street
takes kids there.

08:45.155 --> 08:46.888
It's a fun camp.

08:46.890 --> 08:48.592
I called,
and they said you could go.

08:50.560 --> 08:52.595
Come on,
you're gonna have a great time.

08:52.597 --> 08:57.568
You're gonna make some friends.
You'll make some memories.

09:01.606 --> 09:03.107
Can we just do this?

09:06.077 --> 09:08.277
Do what?

09:08.279 --> 09:10.579
Just drive.

09:10.581 --> 09:11.850
Drive and listen.

09:13.885 --> 09:17.722
Listen to this music.
Me and you.

09:20.156 --> 09:21.990
Just listen to the words.

09:21.992 --> 09:25.927

09:54.858 --> 09:57.628
Okay. This is it.

10:00.097 --> 10:03.831
You ain't never met
a stranger? Hmm?

10:03.833 --> 10:06.668
- All right, I can do this.
- Yeah.

10:06.670 --> 10:08.539
- Geronimo.
- Hey.

10:10.707 --> 10:12.177
You know I love you, right?

10:13.778 --> 10:15.046
Okay.

10:16.680 --> 10:19.348
Go on. Get outta here.

10:19.350 --> 10:21.820
Bye, Mom.

10:28.358 --> 10:33.128
Oh, gosh. I can do this.
I can do this.

10:33.130 --> 10:36.699
No Walkmans at camp.
They'll take it up.

10:36.701 --> 10:37.936
Are you kidding?

10:39.837 --> 10:44.672
Oh, um, hi.
Uh, I'm... I'm Bart.

10:44.674 --> 10:47.976
My friends, like,
they call me Bart.

10:47.978 --> 10:52.047
I know. I'm Shannon. Duh!

10:52.049 --> 10:54.716
- Ready for camp?
- Mmm.

10:54.718 --> 10:56.719
It's totally safe!

10:56.721 --> 10:59.153
See? Safe.

10:59.155 --> 11:01.724
Well,
except for that one kid.

11:01.726 --> 11:04.029
You coming?

11:16.973 --> 11:19.742
Sorry, sorry.
Squeeze in here. Sorry.

11:19.744 --> 11:21.643
Oh, sorry 'bout that!

11:21.645 --> 11:24.680
- Hey, Bart, this is Kent.
- Nice to meet you, Bart.

11:24.682 --> 11:27.749
Hey, bro. This is the cup game.
I'm not very good at it.

11:27.751 --> 11:29.884
Campers.
Campers, up here!

11:29.886 --> 11:31.320
So I'm Rusty.

11:31.322 --> 11:33.122
For those of you
who don't know me,

11:33.124 --> 11:35.324
I'm the Youth Pastor
at Greenville Baptist.

11:35.326 --> 11:36.992
So if you didn't bring
your journals, come up here.

11:36.994 --> 11:38.860
We got one for you.

11:38.862 --> 11:40.863
You're gonna need it
for your session tonight.

11:40.865 --> 11:43.101
- Let's have a great week.
- Bro, sit down. I got you.

11:46.871 --> 11:49.805
So is that like a diary, or?

11:49.807 --> 11:52.774
Kinda, but there's more to it.
Helps get my thoughts ordered.

11:52.776 --> 11:56.277
Prayers, problems, dreams,
stuff I imagine sometimes.

11:56.279 --> 11:57.779
Uh, can I see?

11:57.781 --> 12:00.682
I'm sorry,
I... I didn't know.

12:00.684 --> 12:03.451
B-9, you're with me for
kitchen duty, let's do it.

12:03.453 --> 12:05.921
Well, that's me.
See you later, okay?

12:05.923 --> 12:07.790
Hey, Bart,
I got your journal.

12:07.792 --> 12:09.090
Ooh! Kent!

12:17.802 --> 12:20.069
Here. Here you go.
I'm sorry.

12:30.180 --> 12:33.382
That's mint.
I didn't know you could draw.

12:33.384 --> 12:35.850
Why're you dressed
like that?

12:35.852 --> 12:38.821
Come with me
if you want to live!

12:38.823 --> 12:41.156
We're sneaking out.

12:41.158 --> 12:45.827
So what do you wanna be
when you grow up, an artist?

12:45.829 --> 12:50.132
Eh, or a football player.
That's what my dad was.

12:50.134 --> 12:53.335
He was really good, actually.
Kind of famous in college.

12:53.337 --> 12:56.504
We're gonna get
in so much trouble for this.

12:56.506 --> 12:58.473
I know, right?
Got some great stuff.

12:58.475 --> 13:01.343
Like industrial grade.
Set it all up this afternoon.

13:01.345 --> 13:03.845
So you guys are gonna go
over there

13:03.847 --> 13:05.750
and face in the north direction,
got it?

13:08.419 --> 13:11.255
And also,
did you know Bart can draw?

13:13.189 --> 13:14.425
Hi.

13:17.794 --> 13:21.162
- So you can draw?
- I guess so, a little bit.

13:21.164 --> 13:24.867
Bart, I'm terrified you saw
what was written in my journal.

13:24.869 --> 13:26.869
- Did you?
- No.

13:26.871 --> 13:29.003
- Wh-what're you talking about?
- You're lying.

13:29.005 --> 13:30.873
You saw every word,
didn't you?

13:30.875 --> 13:34.243
Maybe.

13:34.245 --> 13:37.546
Well, then here goes.
You know what I think?

13:37.548 --> 13:39.848
I think that someday
we're gonna fall in love,

13:39.850 --> 13:43.118
get married,
and that's our destiny.

13:43.120 --> 13:44.987
And now I'm mortified.

13:44.989 --> 13:46.455
I'm gonna walk down this hill
and help Kent.

13:46.457 --> 13:49.090
Wa-wa-wa-wait wait.
Shannon, please stay.

13:49.092 --> 13:53.128
Why? Afraid of the dark?
Afraid of monsters?

13:53.130 --> 13:55.799
I just don't like
being alone.

14:29.400 --> 14:31.365
All right, come on, kids.

14:31.367 --> 14:33.003
Bart, Bart!

14:34.505 --> 14:37.505
- Here. It's my favorite.
- Sweet.

14:37.507 --> 14:39.941
And I wanna be a singer
just like her someday.

14:39.943 --> 14:41.609
Thank you so much.

14:41.611 --> 14:45.150
My parents are here pick me up.
Bye!

15:02.900 --> 15:06.634
Last stop. This is you.

15:06.636 --> 15:10.071
It was good to meet you, Bart.
I'm gonna see you on Sunday?

15:10.073 --> 15:11.442
Yeah. Yeah.

15:24.486 --> 15:25.556
Hey.

15:32.630 --> 15:36.998
Momma? Momma...

15:37.000 --> 15:38.133
Where's Momma?

15:38.135 --> 15:41.235
She's gone.

15:41.237 --> 15:43.138
Gone where?

15:43.140 --> 15:46.407
She ran off.
She ain't coming back.

15:46.409 --> 15:48.379
Just you and me now.

15:53.350 --> 15:55.417
When will she be back?

15:55.419 --> 15:57.484
I told you, she run off.

15:57.486 --> 16:01.989
She don't want me no more,
and she don't want you neither.

16:01.991 --> 16:05.192
What did you do?

16:05.194 --> 16:07.528
Are you bowing up on me, boy?

16:07.530 --> 16:10.532
You hurt her, didn't you?!

16:10.534 --> 16:13.134
- Hey!
- You hurt her like you hurt me!

16:13.136 --> 16:14.302
Hey!

16:14.304 --> 16:17.038
Nothing! That's what I did!

16:17.040 --> 16:18.242
Nothing!

16:26.116 --> 16:28.218
She didn't leave 'cause of me.

16:51.475 --> 16:54.075
I'm sorry, Mom!

16:54.077 --> 16:55.579
What did I do?!

16:57.981 --> 17:01.082
Take me, Mom, please!

17:01.084 --> 17:02.452
Stop!

17:16.666 --> 17:19.002
So did you ever
see her again?

17:20.371 --> 17:22.404
Uh,
she'd call now and then.

17:22.406 --> 17:25.240
I tried to live with her once,
one summer in junior high,

17:25.242 --> 17:28.275
but she was in another bad
relationship.

17:28.277 --> 17:30.311
Worse, actually.

17:30.313 --> 17:35.117
Um, my dad drove up and threw
the guy off a staircase

17:35.119 --> 17:37.119
onto the hood of his car
and threatened to kill him

17:37.121 --> 17:38.753
if he ever hurt her again

17:38.755 --> 17:42.124
and then grabbed me
and took me home.

17:42.126 --> 17:44.492
It's kind of ironic.

17:44.494 --> 17:48.463
Um, that was about it.

17:48.465 --> 17:50.234
So what did you do?

17:52.402 --> 17:56.106
I tried to get good at the only
thing my dad really cared about.

18:01.078 --> 18:03.145
- Hey, there.
- Hey there, darlin'.

18:03.147 --> 18:05.147
That's so corny.

18:05.149 --> 18:06.680
You're making
everyone in the stadium

18:06.682 --> 18:08.582
feel real uncomfortable.

18:08.584 --> 18:11.186
Dude, seriously,
that beard makes you look 35.

18:11.188 --> 18:13.722
- Kent, shut up.
- Shut up!

18:13.724 --> 18:15.223
I like it.

18:15.225 --> 18:19.226
Millard!
Get over here, now.

18:19.228 --> 18:21.565
I love you.

18:23.667 --> 18:24.769
I know.

18:26.269 --> 18:28.235
Unbelievable.

18:28.237 --> 18:30.374
- Break!
- Break!

18:59.736 --> 19:03.341
Hey. Just give me a second.

19:06.677 --> 19:09.211
- It's sour.
- Jeez.

19:09.213 --> 19:11.249
It's a month past its date.

19:14.217 --> 19:15.485
I'll make Pop-Tarts, then.

19:17.454 --> 19:19.687
Just a few things I ask you
to do around here, Bart,

19:19.689 --> 19:21.322
a few things.

19:23.560 --> 19:27.228
I caught before I ran, Dad,
at practice today.

19:27.230 --> 19:29.330
Almost scored.

19:29.332 --> 19:32.199
- How many of them did it take?
- What?

19:32.201 --> 19:34.235
To get you down on the ground.
How many'd it take?

19:34.237 --> 19:38.473
- Just one. It's just practice.
- One?

19:38.475 --> 19:40.675
Nobody could never
bring <i>me</i> down.

19:40.677 --> 19:45.280
Took the whole football team.
It's the way I live my life.

19:45.282 --> 19:48.250
Life hits me,
I hit back harder.

19:48.252 --> 19:52.123
I don't go down.
Not then, not now, not never.

19:53.923 --> 19:55.659
You understand?

20:00.397 --> 20:01.732
Break!

20:04.267 --> 20:06.201
<i>I don't go down.</i>

20:06.203 --> 20:08.270
<i>You go down too easy.
That's your problem.</i>

20:59.422 --> 21:01.322
What'd they say?

21:01.324 --> 21:03.824
They said you can't play.

21:03.826 --> 21:05.459
For how long?

21:05.461 --> 21:06.863
Ever.

21:12.902 --> 21:15.337
Well, that's disappointing.

21:15.339 --> 21:17.542
Yeah. Yeah, it is.

21:26.350 --> 21:28.817
- Whoa! Hey.
- Sorry.

21:28.819 --> 21:31.453
- Where are <i>you</i> driving?
- I should've drove.

21:31.455 --> 21:32.954
This is stupid.

21:32.956 --> 21:35.023
Graduating high school
is not stupid.

21:35.025 --> 21:37.491
You just have to pick a new
elective to replace football.

21:37.493 --> 21:39.461
- Yeah.
- Okay.

21:39.463 --> 21:43.264
Oh, man, ever have aspirations
of being a seamstress?

21:43.266 --> 21:46.834
Well, that's full, so.
They're, like, all full.

21:46.836 --> 21:49.571
- Yeah.
- Except this one.

21:49.573 --> 21:53.308

I'm a little jealous.

Miss Fincher!

25:01.765 --> 25:04.965
Unh-unh. No.
What're you trying to do to me?

25:04.967 --> 25:07.936
I can't do this.
I didn't even try out.

25:07.938 --> 25:09.971
You can. And you will.

25:09.973 --> 25:12.005
And there'll be no further
discussion about it.

25:12.007 --> 25:14.576
No, no, no, no, no.
Look, I'm a Millard.

25:14.578 --> 25:16.844
Okay, you don't understand.
Millards play football.

25:16.846 --> 25:19.781
- Millards do not sing.
- You have a gift, Bart.

25:19.783 --> 25:22.716
And in my class,
you will be required to use it.

25:22.718 --> 25:24.819
Or fail. It's your choice.

25:24.821 --> 25:26.855
Look, my leg is still in a cast.
I can't even walk.

25:26.857 --> 25:28.889
There's two months
until the production.

25:28.891 --> 25:31.559
You have plenty of time to heal.
Please stop making excuses.

25:31.561 --> 25:33.962
Okay, I don't sing like that.
That Broadway stuff.

25:33.964 --> 25:35.597
I'll teach you.

25:35.599 --> 25:37.698

25:37.700 --> 25:39.701

Well, you can't keep me here.
I'm free to go.

28:16.092 --> 28:18.892
No, you're not.

28:18.894 --> 28:20.661
We saw something
in your blood work

28:20.663 --> 28:22.763
that concerned us,
so we ran a few tests.

28:22.765 --> 28:24.765
And I'd like to discuss
the results with you.

28:24.767 --> 28:26.967
You got my number.
You can call me.

28:26.969 --> 28:29.670
We need to have
this conversation now.

28:29.672 --> 28:31.007
Okay.

28:34.777 --> 28:36.310
Why did I black out?

28:36.312 --> 28:39.080
Because of extremely
low blood sugar.

28:39.082 --> 28:43.184
So you're saying, what?
I'm diabetic?

28:43.186 --> 28:44.785
No.

28:44.787 --> 28:47.355
On your MRI,
we discovered a mass.

28:47.357 --> 28:49.857
- We believe it's cancer.
- No.

28:49.859 --> 28:53.261
No. No, I don't...

28:53.263 --> 28:55.263
We'd like to run
a few more tests

28:55.265 --> 28:57.400
and then decide on the best
treatment options for you.

28:59.436 --> 29:02.302
I don't...
I don't need your treatment.

29:02.304 --> 29:04.741
I'm gonna go home.

29:07.475 --> 29:09.910
Mr. Millard,
if you refuse treatment,

29:09.912 --> 29:11.814
it could drastically reduce
your chances.

29:22.825 --> 29:25.827
Dad. What happened?

29:25.829 --> 29:29.097
Oh, I'm fine.
I'm just fine.

29:29.099 --> 29:30.831
Okay, well,
let me drive you home.

29:30.833 --> 29:32.332
I-I can make it myself.

29:32.334 --> 29:35.837
Mr. Millard, are you okay?

29:35.839 --> 29:38.205
I'm Shannon,
Bart's girlfriend?

29:38.207 --> 29:41.175
Oh, hello, Shannon.

29:41.177 --> 29:44.846
How'd Bart wind up
with someone as pretty as you?

29:44.848 --> 29:46.313
Thank you.

29:46.315 --> 29:48.849
I'm fine.
I'm gonna be all right.

29:48.851 --> 29:50.483
But did they say what's wrong?

29:50.485 --> 29:52.153
Uh, I just had
a little incident.

29:52.155 --> 29:53.920
I had low blood sugar.

29:53.922 --> 29:57.358
I was over at the diner,
and... and I fell down.

29:57.360 --> 30:00.895
And actually,
I was looking at your name

30:00.897 --> 30:04.899
on an advertisement
for a play.

30:05.301 --> 30:07.838
Didn't think
you'd wanna come.

30:09.505 --> 30:13.507
Did he ever sing for you?
'Cause I-I had no idea.

30:13.509 --> 30:15.176
I had no idea at all.

30:15.178 --> 30:16.878
He was good.
He was real good.

30:16.880 --> 30:18.879
I'm sorry, Dad.
I should've invited you.

30:18.881 --> 30:21.415
Oh, don't... we'll talk
about it later, son.

30:21.417 --> 30:23.050
- Just let me drive you home.
- Oh, no.

30:23.052 --> 30:26.320
You take care
of your pretty girl there.

30:26.322 --> 30:30.558
Where're you going?

30:30.560 --> 30:33.864
Going to the cast party.
I'm not missing it for this.

30:36.431 --> 30:40.134
Excuse me. I'm sorry.
What's wrong with him?

30:40.136 --> 30:42.136
- Are you family?
- No.

30:42.138 --> 30:44.504
Well, you need to ask him.

30:44.506 --> 30:45.939
Thank you.

31:03.059 --> 31:04.926
You're up early.

31:04.928 --> 31:07.594
Made my son breakfast.

31:07.596 --> 31:10.430
What's with the getup?
Going to a funeral?

31:10.432 --> 31:13.533
No.
Just going to church, Dad.

31:13.535 --> 31:15.037
Church.

31:18.207 --> 31:19.810
Sit down and eat.

31:22.211 --> 31:26.112
C'mon, sit down and eat.
Getting cold.

31:26.114 --> 31:30.618
Hey'd you see this?
Did you see that?

31:30.620 --> 31:35.156
Look at that.
Front page.

31:35.158 --> 31:37.390
You look like
a Pinocchio cowboy.

31:37.392 --> 31:41.028
It's a good joke.

31:41.030 --> 31:43.930
So that's what I am to you,
a joke?

31:43.932 --> 31:44.965
I didn't say that.

31:44.967 --> 31:46.399
You just said it.

31:46.401 --> 31:48.069
Don't put words in my mouth.

31:48.071 --> 31:51.205
What if I wanna sing?
Why's that so funny?

31:51.207 --> 31:53.073
I mean, maybe I'm good at it.

31:53.075 --> 31:56.109
The pastor of the church
asked me to sing this morning.

31:56.111 --> 31:57.544
It's gotta mean something.

31:57.546 --> 31:59.613
He ask you to sing
for a living?

31:59.615 --> 32:01.514
That's what I'm saying.

32:01.516 --> 32:03.551
You're gonna need to find
something you're good at

32:03.553 --> 32:05.319
that you can actually earn
a living at

32:05.321 --> 32:07.120
'cause you're gonna have
to support yourself

32:07.122 --> 32:08.656
- one of these days.
- How do you even know?

32:08.658 --> 32:10.992
You've never
even heard me sing.

32:10.994 --> 32:12.659
Well, that's not my fault.

32:12.661 --> 32:15.362
All I hear out of you
is whining and moaning.

32:15.364 --> 32:19.466
Okay. I'm singing
this morning at church.

32:19.468 --> 32:21.636
10:00 on radio AM 1080.

32:21.638 --> 32:23.670
- Why don't you come watch me sing?
- No, I can't do that.

32:23.672 --> 32:25.673
- Why not?
- No. I just don't belong there.

32:25.675 --> 32:28.011
- Why?
- I just don't. I don't!

32:30.013 --> 32:31.946
Don't belong there.

32:31.948 --> 32:33.150
Okay.

32:39.455 --> 32:41.254
My boy Bart's, oh,

32:41.256 --> 32:43.224
he's nothin'
but a big disappointment.

32:43.226 --> 32:46.060
I wish he'd never been born.
Everything'd been just fine.

32:46.062 --> 32:48.161
- Hey...
- All my problems are because of Bart.

32:48.163 --> 32:49.562
Hey, hey,
you put words in my mouth.

32:49.564 --> 32:51.131
I'm gonna put a fist
in your face.

32:51.133 --> 32:52.966
Yeah, I'm a little big
for that, Dad.

32:52.968 --> 32:54.502
- You think?
- I think those days are over.

32:54.504 --> 32:56.436
- Is that what you think?
- Yeah! I do, yeah!

32:56.438 --> 32:58.305
Listen, you have
to talk to me with respect.

32:58.307 --> 33:00.374
I'm the one that puts
the food on the table.

33:00.376 --> 33:02.510
I earn the living around here,
and I'm the one who stayed.

33:02.512 --> 33:04.278
I don't see your Momma
anywhere.

33:04.280 --> 33:06.013
Yeah, well, nobody blames
her for leaving, Dad!

33:06.015 --> 33:07.015
I would've left, too!

33:10.253 --> 33:12.386
Just shut up.
Just shut up and eat.

33:12.388 --> 33:14.088
- I'm not hungry.
- Eat your food.

33:14.090 --> 33:15.391
I'm not hungry!

33:19.294 --> 33:20.964
All right, then.

33:28.004 --> 33:32.173
You kidding me?!
Stay away from me!

33:32.175 --> 33:34.473
I'm serious!
Don't touch me!

33:34.475 --> 33:38.415
I'm done with you! You're crazy!
Get away from me!

34:17.351 --> 34:18.585
Bart, what happened
to your head?

34:18.588 --> 34:20.420
It's bleeding.

34:20.422 --> 34:22.188
- Oh, it's nothing, it's fine.
- Are you okay?

34:22.190 --> 34:23.627
- Are you sure?
- I'm fine

34:25.793 --> 34:27.460
I'm wondering
if you guys could all

34:27.463 --> 34:29.362
maybe pray
for a friend of mine?

34:29.364 --> 34:33.367
This friend I think is lying
to me about their life.

34:33.369 --> 34:35.668
I don't know what to do
because I wanna help,

34:35.670 --> 34:37.737
and they just won't let me,
and I just feel like

34:37.739 --> 34:41.474
the more I try,
it kind of gets worse and worse.

34:41.476 --> 34:45.114
And so now when I look at them,
all I see is a mask.

34:46.416 --> 34:48.547
Pray for them.

34:48.550 --> 34:52.418
No one can live a lie forever,
okay?

34:52.420 --> 34:54.187
Okay, thanks.

34:54.188 --> 34:55.822
Course they know
you're talking about me.

34:55.824 --> 34:57.591
Do you know how embarrassing
that is?

34:57.593 --> 34:59.727
I was just trying
to get you to listen!

34:59.729 --> 35:01.327
What is going on with you?!

35:01.329 --> 35:04.164
- I'm fine.
- You're not fine!

35:04.166 --> 35:06.133
Is it your dad?
I could help.

35:06.135 --> 35:09.102
- Just let me come over.
- I don't want you at my house.

35:09.104 --> 35:11.305
- Why?
- 'Cause I just don't.

35:11.307 --> 35:13.106
Where is this coming from?

35:13.108 --> 35:15.108
I don't know, maybe from deep
inside my mask.

35:15.110 --> 35:16.811
- That's not funny.
- It's kinda funny.

35:16.813 --> 35:18.611
- Please, don't do this.
- You got me all figured out.

35:18.613 --> 35:21.215
You push everyone away!
Don't add me to that list.

35:21.217 --> 35:22.716
I love you.
I've always loved you!

35:22.718 --> 35:24.588
Yeah, well,
I've never really loved you.

35:27.155 --> 35:29.189
I mean, we're...
we're graduating soon.

35:29.191 --> 35:31.191
You're going off to college.
I'm chasing some stupid dream.

35:31.193 --> 35:33.260
- Right?
- I never said your dream was stupid.

35:33.262 --> 35:35.329
I mean, this has been fun.
No regrets for me, all right?

35:35.331 --> 35:36.830
But people change,
you know what I mean?

35:36.832 --> 35:38.765
We obviously can't
get along anymore.

35:38.767 --> 35:42.706
I'm leaving, Shannon.
After graduation I'm... I'm gone.

35:48.677 --> 35:50.711
Please don't.

35:50.713 --> 35:53.446
What?

35:53.448 --> 35:55.548
Go.

35:55.550 --> 35:57.586
I can't stay here,
Shannon.

36:25.814 --> 36:28.249
You know, Mike,
it's amazing how people quit

36:28.251 --> 36:31.251
- when they don't get paid.
- Look, we are opening

36:31.253 --> 36:33.720
for the opening act
at a youth conference.

36:33.722 --> 36:35.923
It's impossible,
that's the whole problem.

36:35.925 --> 36:38.658
"Whether you think you can
or you think you can't,

36:38.660 --> 36:40.727
you're right"...
that's Confucius.

36:40.729 --> 36:42.428
I don't even know
what that means.

36:42.430 --> 36:44.231
And it's offensive to me
as an artist.

36:44.233 --> 36:46.332
An artist?
We're making 90 bucks!

36:46.334 --> 36:47.734
- Right.
- Between the three of us.

36:47.736 --> 36:49.736
We have no vocals.
We got no show.

36:49.738 --> 36:51.671
It's impossible.

36:51.673 --> 36:53.774
Yeah, well,
the only impossible things

36:53.776 --> 36:55.508
are the things
that we call impossible.

36:55.510 --> 36:56.943
What is that? Aristotle?

36:56.945 --> 36:59.613
No,
that one's a fortune cookie.

36:59.615 --> 37:02.249
Nathan,
nobody understands you, man!

37:02.251 --> 37:03.816
- Hey, guys.
- You're always so cranky, man.

37:03.818 --> 37:05.419
- Yeah, since Des Moines.
- Oh, Des Moines.

37:05.421 --> 37:07.320
Why bring up
Des Moines again?

37:07.322 --> 37:09.722
Hey, guys, if you guys
need a singer, I'll sing.

37:09.724 --> 37:12.825
I'm, uh...
I also patch cables,

37:12.827 --> 37:14.827
and, you know,
I can run the board,

37:14.829 --> 37:20.300
and turn the lights on,
and I write songs, too.

37:20.302 --> 37:21.570
Kind of. Sometimes.

37:23.972 --> 37:25.307
Who are you?

37:27.809 --> 37:30.211
<i>I joined up with the band.</i>

37:30.213 --> 37:32.613

38:47.389 --> 38:49.823
And we are Mercy...

38:49.825 --> 38:53.394
And Robbie on the drums!

38:55.597 --> 38:57.398
He's new.

38:57.400 --> 38:59.399
Thank you all
for being here tonight.

38:59.401 --> 39:00.834
Y'all have a good time?

39:00.836 --> 39:03.003
Yeah!

39:03.005 --> 39:06.709
I sure hope so 'cause
that's all the songs we got.

39:09.412 --> 39:12.412
Encore!

39:12.414 --> 39:13.881
You know what?

39:13.883 --> 39:15.582
Let me tell you a story
before we go.

39:15.584 --> 39:20.086
Um... 'cause when I was, uh...

39:20.088 --> 39:23.890
ten, 11 years old,
life was tough.

39:23.892 --> 39:26.727
I mean, it...
it was real tough, actually.

39:26.729 --> 39:29.729
I needed something,
and I remember, I've...

39:29.731 --> 39:32.765
I've always loved music,
you know?

39:32.767 --> 39:37.104
And I found some songs
that I just...

39:37.106 --> 39:41.441
man, I... I held onto,
you know what I mean?

39:41.443 --> 39:44.977
Like an anchor in a storm.
And they got me through.

39:44.979 --> 39:49.048
And they told me about
a Father in heaven that...

39:49.050 --> 39:50.818
that wanted me.

39:50.820 --> 39:54.655
You know,
a Father that loves me so much

39:54.657 --> 39:57.591
that He died for me.

39:57.593 --> 39:59.425
A Father
that would never leave me.

39:59.427 --> 40:02.062
And I listened to these songs
over and over

40:02.064 --> 40:06.466
and over and over again and...
and they gave me hope.

40:06.468 --> 40:09.470
'Cause I needed it.

40:09.472 --> 40:12.138
And maybe tonight, so do you.

40:12.140 --> 40:14.608
Sing this with me.

40:14.610 --> 40:16.876

41:53.142 --> 41:57.144
Thanks for coming.
Hey, Bart.

41:57.146 --> 42:00.113
- Hey, where you headed, man?
- Someone I gotta see, man.

42:00.115 --> 42:01.914
- Who?
- Scott Brickell.

42:01.916 --> 42:04.483
He manages Audio Adrenaline
and a bunch of others.

42:04.485 --> 42:06.919
- Yeah, well, why was he here?
- 'Cause I wrote him a letter

42:06.921 --> 42:08.754
every week
for the past two years.

42:08.756 --> 42:10.126
- Gotta go.
- Uh...

42:13.595 --> 42:17.030
- Mr. Brickell!
- It's just Brickell.

42:17.032 --> 42:19.265
Uh, yeah, uh-huh, okay.

42:19.267 --> 42:22.836
Um, I didn't know
you were coming. Thank you.

42:22.838 --> 42:24.671
Yeah, well, I did.
Merry Christmas.

42:24.673 --> 42:28.075
Uh, you know, we mostly
just play, uh, big shows,

42:28.077 --> 42:31.111
you know, but sometimes
we like to get back to,

42:31.113 --> 42:32.979
you know,
smaller venues like this one.

42:32.981 --> 42:36.015
- Yeah, look, Barth, uh...
- Uh, it's Bart.

42:36.017 --> 42:38.619
Sorry. And what's the name
of your band again?

42:38.621 --> 42:41.888
It's MercyMe, you know,
'cause when I told my memaw

42:41.890 --> 42:43.756
that we were starting a band,
she was, like,

42:43.758 --> 42:45.725
"Mercy me, get a real job."

42:45.727 --> 42:47.628
And I was, like,
"Aw, Memaw!"

42:47.630 --> 42:49.829
And then the guys were like,
"Did she really say that?"

42:49.831 --> 42:52.633
I was, like, "Yeah, we
have to name the band Mercy..."

42:52.635 --> 42:55.202
So that's what we called it.

42:55.204 --> 42:57.303
Son,
the sheer volume of words

42:57.305 --> 43:00.742
that comes outta your mouth
is... exhausting.

43:03.945 --> 43:07.180
You're not ready.
That's what I think.

43:07.182 --> 43:09.716
You got talent.
You got potential.

43:09.718 --> 43:13.921
You can sing, but I don't
you've found your song,

43:13.923 --> 43:15.625
Found your soul,
you know what I'm saying?

43:18.660 --> 43:23.095
Look, that last thing you did,
that was... that was special.

43:23.097 --> 43:26.800
Next gig, you should do that
the whole time, the entire show.

43:26.802 --> 43:28.635
See how that works for you.

43:28.637 --> 43:30.704
That's not the kind of music
that we sing, though.

43:30.706 --> 43:33.240
Trust me, son, you have no idea
what kind of music you sing.

43:33.242 --> 43:35.309
We write our own music.
We don't just do covers.

43:35.311 --> 43:37.678
Well, then write
something like that,

43:37.680 --> 43:39.345
- and then give me a call.
- No, no, no. Wait, wait, wait.

43:39.347 --> 43:42.615
You gotta go with us.
We got two more shows in Texas.

43:42.617 --> 43:45.151
We got plenty of room
on the bus, all right?

43:45.153 --> 43:46.887
You know, you can't just
change up our whole act

43:46.889 --> 43:48.722
and then abandon us, right?

43:48.724 --> 43:52.593
You don't seem like that
kind of person, I can tell.

43:52.595 --> 43:55.662
I flew coach
in a middle seat

43:55.664 --> 43:59.032
to rent a car
that I can't even fit in

43:59.034 --> 44:01.702
to drive three hours
to the middle of nowhere

44:01.704 --> 44:06.707
to have you tell me you want me
to travel on <i>that...</i>

44:06.709 --> 44:07.911
with you?

44:10.244 --> 44:11.678
Yeah.

44:17.251 --> 44:19.655
That's funny.

44:21.055 --> 44:22.958
I need to get another job.

44:34.168 --> 44:35.401
<i>Hello?</i>

44:35.403 --> 44:37.037
Yes, is this Shannon Street?

44:37.039 --> 44:39.106
<i>Yes. Who is this?</i>

44:39.108 --> 44:41.707
Uh, it's the police, ma'am.
Uh, we need to speak with you.

44:41.709 --> 44:44.646
Can you come downstairs?
It's for your own safety.

44:49.751 --> 44:52.121
Get the girl, Bart!
Woo-woo!

44:56.758 --> 44:59.325
- Shannon!
- Bart!

44:59.327 --> 45:03.162
Hey. Long time no see.
You look great.

45:03.164 --> 45:04.830
It's midnight, Bart.
What are you doing here?

45:04.832 --> 45:06.365
We just played a gig here.

45:06.367 --> 45:08.300
I don't know
if you know this yet, but we...

45:08.302 --> 45:11.037
we actually have a CD now
with actual songs on it.

45:11.039 --> 45:14.341
Like a real CD.
Here, that's for you.

45:14.343 --> 45:17.778
We have three more shows.
What if you came with us?

45:17.780 --> 45:19.245
We could go on the road,
we could grab Kent.

45:19.247 --> 45:20.946
Hit the road.
It'd be like before.

45:20.948 --> 45:23.783
Three Musketeers.
I'm going to bed.

45:23.785 --> 45:26.986
Aw, come on, Shannon.
Go on an adventure!

45:26.988 --> 45:28.320
It'll be fun!

45:28.322 --> 45:30.724
Adventure?

45:30.726 --> 45:32.258
- Really?
- Yeah.

45:32.260 --> 45:34.794
What're you thinking,
coming here like this?

45:34.796 --> 45:36.796
I don't know.
I didn't really think about it.

45:36.798 --> 45:38.265
I just thought
it'd be fun, you know?

45:38.267 --> 45:42.202
- Just an idea.
- That's it? Only reason?

45:42.204 --> 45:44.805
Yep.

45:44.807 --> 45:47.744
I don't want to go on
any more adventures with you.

45:54.115 --> 45:55.448
You know,
I want you to know

45:55.450 --> 45:57.818
that I pray for you
all the time.

45:57.820 --> 46:00.820
I do. I really do.

46:00.822 --> 46:02.823
And I hope that you find

46:02.825 --> 46:05.892
whatever it is that
you're looking for out there.

46:05.894 --> 46:07.830
Thank you for the CD.

46:11.133 --> 46:13.269
Forrest Gump's taking
his time back there.

46:15.369 --> 46:17.204
She will not be joining us.

46:17.206 --> 46:19.773
Shocker.

46:19.775 --> 46:21.977
Well,
ain't <i>she</i> the smart one?

46:50.773 --> 46:53.475
- It's good.
- Nathan, it's real good.

46:56.177 --> 46:59.281
Let's do it.
Let's blow him away.

Hey! Where you going?

48:01.209 --> 48:02.508
Back to Nashville.

48:02.510 --> 48:05.447
I've seen all I need to see.

48:07.548 --> 48:09.615
Plus, I need to make some plans
on account

48:09.617 --> 48:11.885
of booking you guys
a venue for GMA week.

48:11.887 --> 48:14.086
What is GMA week?

48:14.088 --> 48:16.923
- What is that?
- It's only the biggest convention in music...

48:16.925 --> 48:19.358
- Just go on the bus!
- All right.

48:19.360 --> 48:20.994
I couldn't get
the main stage,

48:20.996 --> 48:22.928
but I'll get
some record labels there.

48:22.930 --> 48:26.365
What I need you to do is invite
every youth group you can.

48:26.367 --> 48:27.968
Stack the room.

48:27.970 --> 48:29.568
And then just do
what you did tonight.

48:29.570 --> 48:32.305
Wait.
So you liked tonight?

48:32.307 --> 48:33.910
Don't get cocky, kid.

48:54.997 --> 48:56.629
<i>Hey, this is Shannon.
Leave a message.</i>

48:56.631 --> 49:00.033
Hey, Shannon.

49:00.035 --> 49:02.135
Uh, it's Bart.

49:02.137 --> 49:04.137
Just uh...

49:04.139 --> 49:06.372
look, you said you, uh,
prayed for me

49:06.374 --> 49:08.575
all the time, and I, uh...

49:08.577 --> 49:12.044
we're playing this, uh,
big showcase tomorrow,

49:12.046 --> 49:15.115
and, uh,
it's a big deal for us,

49:15.117 --> 49:17.517
and we just, uh... we're ready.

49:17.519 --> 49:22.191
But we're a...
touch frightened too, um...

49:24.459 --> 49:28.461
I guess that's it.
Just wanted to tell you that.

49:28.463 --> 49:29.463
Uh...

49:52.287 --> 49:54.187
Little off-Broadway,
I know, but it's the best

49:54.189 --> 49:56.055
- I could do on short notice.
- Are you kidding me?

49:56.057 --> 49:57.957
This is perfect.

49:57.959 --> 49:59.959
Oh, and, guys,
this is your sound man, Dingo.

49:59.961 --> 50:02.128
Anything you need,
you just let him know.

50:02.130 --> 50:04.064
You got us a sound guy?

50:04.066 --> 50:06.066
Did you get a label to come?

50:06.068 --> 50:08.068
No.

50:08.070 --> 50:11.271
I got five.
Working on a few more.

50:11.273 --> 50:14.410
I just need you to make sure
this place is full.

50:17.979 --> 50:19.979
And bring the rain,
gentlemen.

50:19.981 --> 50:21.480
- Yeah you got it.
- Absolutely.

50:34.095 --> 50:37.097
Buddy, you ready for this?

50:37.099 --> 50:38.234
Good crowd, huh?

50:40.501 --> 50:43.102
Bart, we've got
a little situation

50:43.104 --> 50:45.106
I need to talk to you about.

50:47.209 --> 50:48.444
Come on.

50:51.546 --> 50:54.013
So, Bart, there's somebody
I want you to meet.

50:54.015 --> 50:55.381
This is a friend of mine.

50:55.383 --> 50:57.117
He came down here tonight
to see us.

50:57.119 --> 50:58.617
- Whoa, Smitty?!
- This is Michael W. Smith.

50:58.619 --> 51:00.754
Smitty, right?

51:00.756 --> 51:02.722
That's what your friends
call you, right?

51:02.724 --> 51:04.557
Yeah, yeah, uh,
nice to meet you.

51:04.559 --> 51:08.561
I am, like, a huge fan
from, like, all the...

51:08.563 --> 51:10.162
- sorry, like,
- That's okay, man.

51:10.164 --> 51:11.664
All the way back.
Way back.

51:11.666 --> 51:14.767
Your tour with was just
so inspiring for me.

51:14.769 --> 51:17.236
I remember you wore
that vest, that red vest!

51:17.238 --> 51:20.140
- Dude, that was bold.
- I don't think I wore a red vest.

51:20.142 --> 51:21.573
- I would buy that vest.
- No, you did.

51:21.575 --> 51:23.809
You wore this red vest.
You remember?

51:23.811 --> 51:26.379
Di... did I wear a red vest
on our tour?

51:26.381 --> 51:27.546
- He did.
- Yes, you did.

51:27.548 --> 51:29.816
It was velvet.

51:29.818 --> 51:31.617
Oh, man.

51:31.619 --> 51:33.318
What?

51:33.320 --> 51:36.391
Miss Bart, I'm...
oh, we're... okay.

51:40.162 --> 51:41.564
Uh...

51:43.432 --> 51:45.698
- You okay?
- I just threw up a little bit.

51:45.700 --> 51:49.068
Yeah. No, I'm good.
I just... you are like...

51:49.070 --> 51:52.137
The first Christian tape
I ever got was "Never Alone."

51:52.139 --> 51:56.376
And it was like...
like an anchor for me.

51:56.378 --> 51:58.178
Thank you so much.
That means so much to me.

51:58.180 --> 52:00.613
Yeah, it was just...
It was... it was great.

52:00.615 --> 52:02.215
There you are.

52:02.217 --> 52:04.117
We're just so excited
to cheer you on.

52:04.119 --> 52:05.785
- Here's Wonder Woman!
- Go get him, please.

52:05.787 --> 52:07.720
Here's Amy Grant!
You are like a super hero...

52:07.722 --> 52:09.823
- We gotta roll. Sorry.
- What, we're hanging out.

52:09.825 --> 52:11.791
- Hi, guys.
- This is Mike.

52:11.793 --> 52:15.494
- Hey. Good luck, Bart.
- Yeah, good... have a good one.

52:15.496 --> 52:17.530
- Did you see who that was?
- I did.

52:17.532 --> 52:20.200
That was Amy Grant.
She talked to me.

52:39.354 --> 52:42.555
Come on, Nashvi-i-lle!

52:42.557 --> 52:45.557
Whoo! What's up GMA?

52:45.559 --> 52:47.762
Are you guys ready
to rock tonight?

52:50.865 --> 52:54.200
Man, we are so glad
to be here with you!

52:54.202 --> 52:56.769
Ever feel like everything
in your life

52:56.771 --> 53:00.907
is just building and building
and building to one big moment?

53:00.909 --> 53:04.313
That's how we feel tonight!
Let's do this!

53:17.358 --> 53:19.427
Whoo!

53:23.664 --> 53:27.367
Bart.
You're stressing me out, man.

53:27.369 --> 53:31.637
Sorry.
It's nerves, you know.

53:31.639 --> 53:33.741
I wish they'd hurry up.

53:35.943 --> 53:37.843
I thought it was good, right?
It felt good.

53:37.845 --> 53:39.812
- It was good.
- It was good, man.

53:39.814 --> 53:42.418
- Best show we ever played.
- Crowd was into it, man.

53:44.519 --> 53:46.753
- I'm gonna go talk to them.
- No! Hey! Hey!

53:46.755 --> 53:49.454
- Don't do that, Bart!
- Brickell's got it.

53:49.456 --> 53:51.457
Let him do his job.

53:51.459 --> 53:53.629
What if he can't?

54:00.501 --> 54:02.234
- Hey!
- Wait! Wait!

54:02.236 --> 54:04.303
- Dude, no!
- That's a mistake.

54:04.305 --> 54:06.705
But if you could see
how far they've come from

54:06.707 --> 54:09.575
- the first time I saw 'em...
- Hey! Hey, guys!

54:09.577 --> 54:12.711
Gentlemen.
Oh, and also lady.

54:12.713 --> 54:14.646
- So you guys know Bart?
- Nice to meet y'all.

54:14.648 --> 54:16.249
- Thanks for coming out tonight.
- And I've been getting

54:16.251 --> 54:18.218
some good feedback
from these guys,

54:18.220 --> 54:20.653
- and I'm almost finished...
- Was that awesome or what?

54:20.655 --> 54:22.689
- Don't y'all agree?
- I think we're pretty much finished up here anyway.

54:22.691 --> 54:25.325
Ah, come on,
I wanna know what you think!

54:25.327 --> 54:28.296
- Let me, let me finish up here...
- I want to know what they think.

54:38.340 --> 54:39.805
You really wanna know?

54:39.807 --> 54:43.242
Yeah, I do!
Come on, lay it on me.

54:43.244 --> 54:44.943
Give me all you got,
Mr. Music Man.

54:44.945 --> 54:48.780
- I have the skin of a rhino.
- All I got, okay.

54:48.782 --> 54:51.584
I'm sorry to have to be
the one tell you this, kid,

54:51.586 --> 54:56.356
but, um...
you're just not good enough.

54:56.358 --> 54:57.789
Not yet, anyway.

54:57.791 --> 55:01.827
What? You're wrong.

55:01.829 --> 55:04.963
Seventh graders at youth camp,
that's one thing, Bart.

55:04.965 --> 55:06.899
But this,
this is about record sales.

55:06.901 --> 55:08.635
And I just can't sell
what you're doing up there.

55:08.637 --> 55:10.903
Seventh gr...
we packed the house, man.

55:10.905 --> 55:12.872
We've been selling our
own albums for years now.

55:12.874 --> 55:16.642
I mean, what... what world
are you guys living in?

55:16.644 --> 55:18.246
Reality.

55:19.881 --> 55:22.347
Look, you need to embrace
reality, Bart.

55:22.349 --> 55:24.316
Your stuff...

55:24.318 --> 55:27.887
You're not good enough, Bart.
Dreams don't pay the bills.

55:27.889 --> 55:30.657
All it does...

55:30.659 --> 55:34.394
is keep you from all this...

55:34.396 --> 55:37.062
from knowing what's real.

55:37.064 --> 55:38.731
What about the stuff
we played at the end?

55:38.733 --> 55:40.498
The worship music?

55:40.501 --> 55:42.001
Oh, it was beautiful,
magical, truly.

55:42.003 --> 55:43.535
I've got a brother-in-law
in Denver.

55:43.537 --> 55:45.338
He's looking for
a worship pastor.

55:45.340 --> 55:47.407
- I could put you two together.
- Is she serious?

55:47.409 --> 55:49.975
It's the truth you're mad at,
not me.

55:49.977 --> 55:52.412
My high school football team,
there were a couple of guys

55:52.414 --> 55:55.381
that were good enough to make
a big noise in a small town.

55:55.383 --> 55:57.082
<i>But that was it.
You know what?</i>

55:57.084 --> 55:59.651
<i>They're still there.
They're stuck.</i>

55:59.653 --> 56:01.820
<i>And that's what'll happen
to you.</i>

56:01.822 --> 56:03.756
- You gotta be good at something we can sell.
- Just stop!

56:03.758 --> 56:05.425
Do you guys not get it?
