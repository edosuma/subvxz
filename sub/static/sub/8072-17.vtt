WEBVTT

00:08.109 --> 00:08.976
Yep.

00:09.009 --> 00:10.678
This whole place is mine.

00:10.711 --> 00:12.513
Anything you want is free.

00:12.546 --> 00:14.548
Do they let you work here?

00:14.582 --> 00:15.549
I don't have to.

00:15.583 --> 00:16.884
I'm an owner.

00:16.917 --> 00:18.819
Oh, yeah?

00:18.852 --> 00:20.254
Prove it.

00:20.288 --> 00:21.155
OK, you want to see?

00:27.228 --> 00:30.498
JACKIE: DJ, what are you doing?

00:30.531 --> 00:32.800
He made me.

00:32.833 --> 00:35.869
This is why you don't
have any friends, DJ.

00:35.903 --> 00:37.305
JACKIE: You guys,
sit down there.

00:37.338 --> 00:40.608
I'll make you a
couple of sandwiches.

00:40.641 --> 00:42.910
She's new.

00:42.943 --> 00:45.546
Anything's better than
having your mom here.

00:45.579 --> 00:46.680
Hey, DJ.

00:46.714 --> 00:48.382
Hey, Jordan.

00:48.416 --> 00:54.122
Oh, Mrs. Conner, you look
especially lovely today.

00:54.155 --> 00:55.123
Brace yourself.

00:55.156 --> 00:56.257
Roseanne, mom just called.

00:56.290 --> 00:58.092
Someone's coming here,
someone you don't like.

00:58.126 --> 01:00.994
That could be anybody.

01:01.028 --> 01:02.430
Cousin Ronnie.

01:02.463 --> 01:03.364
Oh my god.

01:03.397 --> 01:04.265
She heard about dad.

01:04.298 --> 01:05.566
She wants to pay her respects.

01:05.599 --> 01:08.102
Well, couldn't she have her
secretary fax her respects

01:08.136 --> 01:10.070
from a royal yacht or something?

01:10.104 --> 01:11.705
She have to come down here for?

01:11.739 --> 01:16.944
I would like to stick around,
but I have a lot of stuff

01:16.977 --> 01:19.380
to do.

01:19.413 --> 01:20.714
You're not going anywhere.

01:20.748 --> 01:21.849
You're going to
be right here when

01:21.882 --> 01:24.352
the happiness hits the fan.

01:24.385 --> 01:25.419
All right.

01:25.453 --> 01:26.954
You can make me stay,
but for God sakes,

01:26.987 --> 01:29.657
let the little ones go.

01:29.690 --> 01:32.426
Blow.

01:32.460 --> 01:33.327
Come on, you guys.

01:33.361 --> 01:34.228
Fill me in.

01:34.262 --> 01:36.297
Don't hog the hate.

01:36.330 --> 01:37.298
You better tell her, Jackie.

01:37.331 --> 01:38.232
I'll get too upset.

01:38.266 --> 01:39.133
All right.

01:39.167 --> 01:40.067
Ronnie's a cousin.

01:40.100 --> 01:41.269
She's a jerk.

01:41.302 --> 01:45.606
Uh, about 25 years ago
they had a misunderstanding.

01:45.639 --> 01:46.807
Wasn't a misunderstanding.

01:46.840 --> 01:48.742
I was totally right, and
she was completely wrong.

01:48.776 --> 01:50.611
Roseanne thought that she
was going to be a bridesmaid

01:50.644 --> 01:51.545
in Ronnie's wedding.

01:51.579 --> 01:53.147
And now Roseanne
will interrupt me.

01:53.181 --> 01:54.915
But Ronnie didn't think
that I was good enough

01:54.948 --> 01:56.984
to be in her crummy,
little wedding,

01:57.017 --> 01:58.319
you know, which is
totally fine with me,

01:58.352 --> 02:01.189
because it was a pretentious,
overblown piece of crap,

02:01.222 --> 02:02.390
anyway.

02:02.423 --> 02:03.991
Was it a day or
an evening wedding?

02:07.461 --> 02:08.462
Never mind.

02:08.496 --> 02:12.099
If you need me, I'll
be in the kitchen

02:12.132 --> 02:15.336
Well, here, clean up a
little before she gets here.

02:15.369 --> 02:16.737
You mad at me for?

02:16.770 --> 02:19.039
Because you're my sister,
and if I hate somebody,

02:19.072 --> 02:20.040
you got to hate them too.

02:20.073 --> 02:22.743
That's-- that's called love.

02:22.776 --> 02:25.179
It was never my fight, anyway.

02:25.213 --> 02:26.113
And besides, you don't know.

02:26.146 --> 02:27.981
It's been 25 years.

02:28.015 --> 02:30.918
Maybe she's come down hard
since the last time we saw her.

02:44.565 --> 02:45.366
Ronnie.

02:50.738 --> 02:54.141
[theme music]

03:40.621 --> 03:43.957
Well, Jackie,
you've certainly grown

03:43.991 --> 03:46.159
out of that awkward stage.

03:46.193 --> 03:48.396
Well, happened
about a week ago.

03:48.429 --> 03:54.034
We're all very-- very
happy about that.

03:54.067 --> 03:55.403
How's your sister?

03:55.436 --> 03:56.236
She's good.

03:58.972 --> 04:01.642
She's right over there.

04:01.675 --> 04:04.144
Yes, I see her.

04:04.177 --> 04:06.747
Well, I can see that you
two obviously want to talk,

04:06.780 --> 04:08.782
so I will just get
out of your way.

04:16.123 --> 04:18.992
Uh, would you like
some coffee or something?

04:19.026 --> 04:20.861
Yeah, coffee would be great.

04:25.132 --> 04:26.166
That's a nice outfit.

04:26.199 --> 04:28.436
Thank you.

04:28.469 --> 04:30.404
That's a nice place.

04:33.507 --> 04:34.708
Oh, this old thing?

04:34.742 --> 04:37.645
I just threw it
together this morning.

04:37.678 --> 04:40.681
Rosie, I was so sorry
to hear about your father.

04:40.714 --> 04:42.650
You know, I really loved him.

04:42.683 --> 04:47.721
Well, you had the advantage
of not being his kid.

04:47.755 --> 04:49.222
I would have come
to the funeral,

04:49.256 --> 04:51.191
but I only heard about
it a few days ago.

04:51.224 --> 04:52.660
That's OK.

04:52.693 --> 04:55.863
Mom took pictures.

04:55.896 --> 04:59.166
Look, I know there's been a
lot of bad blood between us.

04:59.199 --> 05:00.634
And I know we've
said a lot of things

05:00.668 --> 05:03.203
to each other, which
although extremely clever,

05:03.236 --> 05:05.539
we probably regret.

05:05.573 --> 05:06.774
But I really think
this is a time

05:06.807 --> 05:08.442
for families to be together.

05:08.476 --> 05:12.446
Yeah, death is
such an icebreaker.

05:12.480 --> 05:14.748
I want you and I to
bury the hatchet, Rosie.

05:14.782 --> 05:16.484
I'm sick of being mad at you.

05:16.517 --> 05:18.151
You mad at me?

05:18.185 --> 05:19.720
You're the one that
didn't make your closest

05:19.753 --> 05:22.490
cousin your bridesmaid.

05:22.523 --> 05:23.391
I was in New York.

05:23.424 --> 05:24.425
I'd made new friends.

05:24.458 --> 05:26.560
I had obligations.

05:26.594 --> 05:28.596
Yeah, well, what about
your obligations to me?

05:28.629 --> 05:30.531
You know, I was sitting there
waiting for a call from you

05:30.564 --> 05:34.468
to tell me what kind of
hideous tangerine chiffon

05:34.502 --> 05:35.803
bridesmaid dress to wear.

05:35.836 --> 05:38.171
And then I get an invitation
three months later

05:38.205 --> 05:40.207
that 350 other people got.

05:40.240 --> 05:41.609
I was crushed.

05:41.642 --> 05:43.611
Tangerine chiffon?

05:43.644 --> 05:45.012
That is so '60s.

05:47.781 --> 05:50.350
Well, it was the '60s.

05:50.384 --> 05:51.752
Nancy, if you don't
mind, this really

05:51.785 --> 05:54.655
has nothing to do with you, OK?

05:54.688 --> 05:56.624
I mean, I only knew
Nancy for one year,

05:56.657 --> 05:59.092
and she made me one
of her bridesmaids.

05:59.126 --> 06:02.763
Yeah, but I don't
have that many friends.

06:02.796 --> 06:06.233
Are those Charles Jourdan boots?

06:06.266 --> 06:07.234
They're gorgeous.

06:07.267 --> 06:09.036
Did you buy them new?

06:09.069 --> 06:11.472
Is that a Fendi bag?

06:11.505 --> 06:13.006
Are these Mizrahi gloves?

06:13.040 --> 06:14.274
You know, I'm a
little busy now.

06:14.307 --> 06:17.445
Would you come back and
envy me in about 10 minutes?

06:17.478 --> 06:19.813
Nancy, there's a
customer over there

06:19.847 --> 06:20.981
that could use some service.

06:21.014 --> 06:23.617
And I'm sure his overalls
are Oshkosh B'gosh.

06:27.354 --> 06:28.522
We'll gab later.

06:28.556 --> 06:31.625
Love your earrings.

06:31.659 --> 06:33.160
You know, I just
cannot believe that

06:33.193 --> 06:35.663
you have been mad
at me for 25 years

06:35.696 --> 06:37.264
because of my stupid wedding.

06:37.297 --> 06:38.466
Well, it wasn't just that.

06:38.499 --> 06:40.100
It was a whole bunch of
other stuff too, you know.

06:40.133 --> 06:41.435
You were supposed
to go to New York,

06:41.469 --> 06:42.670
and then I was going to follow.

06:42.703 --> 06:43.971
And you were going
to get an apartment.

06:44.004 --> 06:45.238
I was going to come
and live with you.

06:45.272 --> 06:47.941
And it was, you know,
going be like that girl.

06:50.611 --> 06:52.112
I was only in my early 20s.

06:52.145 --> 06:54.214
I didn't know where I was going.

06:54.247 --> 06:58.351
Yeah, but I was 14,
and I believed you.

06:58.385 --> 07:01.388
I wasn't thinking.

07:01.421 --> 07:05.425
I was very insensitive.

07:05.459 --> 07:06.694
All right, I was a total butt.

07:09.597 --> 07:12.733
OK, well since you came
this far and everything,

07:12.766 --> 07:14.635
I'd really like you to come
over and meet my family.

07:14.668 --> 07:16.770
I've told them all
about you, so now

07:16.804 --> 07:20.173
would be a good time for you
to come and defend yourself.

07:20.207 --> 07:22.009
Great.

07:22.042 --> 07:23.644
Um, Jackie, would
you watch this place?

07:23.677 --> 07:24.712
We're gonna leave.

07:24.745 --> 07:26.246
JACKIE: OK, you got it.

07:26.279 --> 07:31.719
Oh, hey, so, uh, are you
still married to that same guy?

07:31.752 --> 07:34.021
Oh, after everything
I put you through,

07:34.054 --> 07:35.923
we never even made it to
our first anniversary.

07:35.956 --> 07:36.824
I know.

07:36.857 --> 07:39.560
I heard.

07:39.593 --> 07:40.694
Thanks.

07:40.728 --> 07:43.196
I heard Becky got married.

07:43.230 --> 07:44.097
Any grandchildren yet?

07:46.700 --> 07:47.501
Good one.

07:55.809 --> 08:00.480
[laughing] Look at us.

08:00.514 --> 08:03.917
Brown's Lake, 1967.

08:03.951 --> 08:06.787
Who's the little boy pulling
the shirt over his head?

08:06.820 --> 08:07.621
That's Jackie.

08:12.560 --> 08:13.694
Said we we're
all going to do it.

08:18.231 --> 08:19.567
Do you still have
the picture of her

08:19.600 --> 08:23.303
doing the pantieless cartwheel?

08:23.336 --> 08:25.005
Yeah, it's in
there some place.

08:25.038 --> 08:30.077
Yeah, had a lot of great
times together, didn't we?

08:30.110 --> 08:32.646
Maybe I can find a picture
of that mud fight in here.

08:32.680 --> 08:35.649
Oh, God, is that mud fight
going to haunt me forever?

08:35.683 --> 08:38.385
Yeah, remember how I upset
I got at you for stealing

08:38.418 --> 08:39.319
my boyfriend Blake?

08:44.057 --> 08:45.626
Whose old beater's that?

08:45.659 --> 08:49.362
It was mine, before
your mother totaled it.

08:49.396 --> 08:50.864
You totaled a car?

08:50.898 --> 08:55.202
Well, it wasn't her fault.
The cops were chasing her.

08:55.235 --> 08:57.504
The cops were chasing you?

08:57.537 --> 09:00.273
Of course, it was a stolen car.

09:00.307 --> 09:03.143
You stole a car?

09:03.176 --> 09:05.746
You know, if she had
not totalled that car,

09:05.779 --> 09:08.649
she would have been right
across the state line.

09:08.682 --> 09:10.718
Where were you going?

09:10.751 --> 09:11.752
Across the state line.

09:11.785 --> 09:13.721
I don't know.

09:13.754 --> 09:15.656
I was only 13.

09:15.689 --> 09:18.325
How come you never
told Darlene any of this?

09:18.358 --> 09:23.430
Because I was afraid it
would bring us together.

09:23.463 --> 09:25.298
Oh, you think I was so cool.

09:25.332 --> 09:27.534
I was nothing more
than a Ronnie wannabe.

09:27.567 --> 09:29.136
Oh, stop it, Rosie.

09:29.169 --> 09:30.203
No, Ronnie.

09:30.237 --> 09:31.438
It's true.

09:31.471 --> 09:33.741
You are always somebody who
could never settle down.

09:33.774 --> 09:35.508
I couldn't even make it
across the state line,

09:35.542 --> 09:38.245
but you made it all
the way to New York.

09:38.278 --> 09:42.015
I think my problem is that I
could never really overcome

09:42.049 --> 09:44.251
my basic nurturing instinct.

09:44.284 --> 09:47.755
Get the hell out of my chair.

09:47.788 --> 09:51.692
I had the urge to
roam too, Ronnie.

09:51.725 --> 09:53.593
That's why I drove the big rigs.

09:57.030 --> 09:58.732
Yeah, I think I could've
made it out of here

09:58.766 --> 10:02.703
too if I hadn't hit that
big, old wall of love

10:02.736 --> 10:05.906
and married him.

10:05.939 --> 10:07.607
Always had a touch
of the wanderlust.

10:10.277 --> 10:11.178
Bit of a loner, really.

10:14.948 --> 10:17.985
So Ronnie, what do
you do in New York?

10:18.018 --> 10:21.154
Well, I'm an editor with
"American Interiors" magazine.

10:21.188 --> 10:26.526
Whoa, I knew illiteracy wasn't
a dominant gene in our family.

10:26.559 --> 10:29.362
Now, now, Darlene, you've
got to stand in line.

10:29.396 --> 10:31.598
Ronnie was my idol first.

10:31.631 --> 10:34.501
I wanted to get out of
Lanford, and she did.

10:34.534 --> 10:36.103
I wanted to write
children's books,

10:36.136 --> 10:38.138
and she became the writer.

10:38.171 --> 10:38.972
Yup.

10:43.443 --> 10:46.747
Don't envy me.

10:46.780 --> 10:49.316
My kinda life's
not for everybody.

10:58.491 --> 10:59.592
Towels are in the bathroom.

10:59.626 --> 11:00.728
Sheets are in the drawer.

11:00.761 --> 11:03.697
No boys after 11:00.

11:03.731 --> 11:05.632
That doesn't
give me much time.

11:05.665 --> 11:07.334
[laughing]

11:07.367 --> 11:09.202
You know, your mother
didn't describe you properly.

11:09.236 --> 11:11.839
She said that you were
dark and brooding.

11:11.872 --> 11:14.074
Yeah, well, I save that
for the immediate family,

11:14.107 --> 11:15.943
but I'll make an exception.

11:15.976 --> 11:16.844
School sucks.

11:16.877 --> 11:17.745
I'm bombing out.

11:17.778 --> 11:19.112
My future's bleak.

11:19.146 --> 11:20.647
And yourself?

11:20.680 --> 11:23.150
Well, I've just been
amusing myself by rifling

11:23.183 --> 11:24.952
through your possessions.

11:24.985 --> 11:26.653
David and I haven't
used any of those yet.

11:26.686 --> 11:28.922
We just bought them in case our
relationship keeps progressing.

11:28.956 --> 11:30.323
Hey.

11:30.357 --> 11:33.226
Hey, relax.

11:33.260 --> 11:35.996
I used to buy them for your mom.

11:36.029 --> 11:39.566
Now, I read this
short story of yours,

11:39.599 --> 11:41.668
and I think it's really good.

11:41.701 --> 11:45.305
I can't believe you
invaded my privacy like that.

11:45.338 --> 11:47.307
But since you liked
it, I'll get over it.

11:47.340 --> 11:49.877
I can't believe that
you got an F for that.

11:49.910 --> 11:51.444
I really want to be
a writer, but I know

11:51.478 --> 11:53.246
I'm just going to rot here.

11:53.280 --> 11:56.483
Great minds of Lanford just
don't appreciate my stuff.

11:56.516 --> 11:59.319
Oh, Darlene, don't buy into
what those teachers in Lanford

11:59.352 --> 12:00.553
tell you.

12:00.587 --> 12:02.555
They turn out seven
professionals a year,

12:02.589 --> 12:05.092
and they all work
in the same garage.

12:05.125 --> 12:07.294
You're the only person that's
gotten out of this hell hole

12:07.327 --> 12:09.629
and made it back
to tell about it.

12:09.662 --> 12:11.799
Do you want to
know how I did it?

12:11.832 --> 12:15.869
I just got into the car
and never looked back.

12:15.903 --> 12:17.670
Oh, I wish I could do that.

12:17.704 --> 12:19.506
You know, there's this great
writing school in New York

12:19.539 --> 12:21.108
that I could go to
now if I just took

12:21.141 --> 12:22.542
one of those equivalency tests.

12:22.575 --> 12:24.644
Well, why don't you
go after high school?

12:24.677 --> 12:26.046
Well, if I wait till
after high school,

12:26.079 --> 12:29.682
I will of had all the
creativity sucked out of me.

12:29.716 --> 12:33.053
What would you tell me to
do if I was your daughter?

12:33.086 --> 12:37.257
Well, if you were my daughter,
I'd tell you to stay at school

12:37.290 --> 12:40.093
and clean your room.

12:40.127 --> 12:46.366
But if it were me, I'd probably
drop out and go for it.

12:46.399 --> 12:49.036
Well, what would
you do for money?

12:49.069 --> 12:51.471
Well, first I'd see if I
could get into the school,

12:51.504 --> 12:54.808
and then maybe I'd hit
my rich cousin for a loan

12:54.842 --> 12:57.277
and maybe a place to stay.

12:57.310 --> 12:58.545
You'd do that for me?

12:58.578 --> 13:00.413
You're kidding.

13:00.447 --> 13:03.851
Darlene, this may depress
the hell out of you,

13:03.884 --> 13:05.819
but you do remind
me of your mother.

13:08.788 --> 13:11.424
You know, in spite
of that comment,

13:11.458 --> 13:14.394
I'm going to let you
lend me the money.

13:14.427 --> 13:17.497
Now you really remind
me of your mother.

13:17.530 --> 13:19.266
God-- dropping out of school.

13:19.299 --> 13:21.401
Moving to New York.

13:21.434 --> 13:24.371
You know, maybe you should
let me tell my mom about this.

13:24.404 --> 13:26.339
So rare that I get to
bring her any good news.

13:30.810 --> 13:32.112
RONNIE: Watch your
language, boys.

13:32.145 --> 13:33.046
There's a lady in the room.

13:33.080 --> 13:33.947
Hey, Ronnie.

13:33.981 --> 13:35.949
This is DJ's friend Jordan.

13:35.983 --> 13:36.783
Pleasure.

13:39.652 --> 13:40.753
All the rest of
my poker buddies

13:40.787 --> 13:41.855
had to stay after school.

13:44.724 --> 13:45.959
I ought to be going.

13:45.993 --> 13:47.995
My mom wants me home by 5:00.

13:48.028 --> 13:49.096
What, are you
gonna play cards,

13:49.129 --> 13:52.465
or you're gonna to
listen to your mommy?

13:52.499 --> 13:54.067
We're eating dinner
at his house tonight.

13:54.101 --> 13:54.902
Bye.

13:57.304 --> 13:58.105
But I got a straight.

14:00.941 --> 14:03.710
Well, I'm out $0.25.

14:03.743 --> 14:05.278
You up for a hand?

14:05.312 --> 14:06.546
No way.

14:06.579 --> 14:10.683
Last time I went to
Vegas, I lost a bundle.

14:10.717 --> 14:15.222
Never actually used that
word when it comes to money.

14:15.255 --> 14:18.391
What exactly is a bundle?

14:18.425 --> 14:19.927
You don't want to know.

14:19.960 --> 14:21.694
Try me.

14:21.728 --> 14:25.565
Well, one night
I lost two grand.

14:25.598 --> 14:29.002
Good God.

14:29.036 --> 14:30.070
On one hand.

14:30.103 --> 14:33.506
[screech]

14:33.540 --> 14:34.507
I'm sorry.

14:34.541 --> 14:36.809
I know this sounds
like I'm bragging.

14:36.843 --> 14:38.745
Yeah, it does, but keep going.

14:38.778 --> 14:40.280
This is the closest
I'm ever going to come

14:40.313 --> 14:43.951
to a vulgar display of wealth.

14:43.984 --> 14:45.118
Hey, where is everybody?

14:45.152 --> 14:46.719
I could use a hand out here.

14:46.753 --> 14:47.554
Yes, dear.

14:50.523 --> 14:53.893
Well, I wasn't going to
buy this many groceries.

14:53.927 --> 14:56.163
But there was a brand-new
girl at the grocery store,

14:56.196 --> 14:59.532
and she actually took my check.

14:59.566 --> 15:01.201
I wish you'd let me
pay for some of these.

15:01.234 --> 15:02.102
Oh, nonsense.

15:02.135 --> 15:03.003
You're the guest.

15:03.036 --> 15:05.405
Only Dan and the kids pay.

15:05.438 --> 15:07.274
Well, at least let
me put them away.

15:07.307 --> 15:08.508
I never get to do this at home.

15:08.541 --> 15:09.809
It will be fun.

15:09.842 --> 15:13.580
Well, hey, there's a mop
up against the fridge there.

15:13.613 --> 15:16.649
Party down.

15:16.683 --> 15:18.685
Extraordinary couple of days.

15:18.718 --> 15:20.988
First your cousin turns out
to be a decent human being.

15:21.021 --> 15:25.858
And get this, Darlene's
having trouble in school.

15:25.892 --> 15:26.994
So what?

15:27.027 --> 15:30.463
She's the state's problem
from 8:00 to 3:00.

15:30.497 --> 15:32.865
I think they're about to
throw her back in our lap.

15:32.899 --> 15:35.335
The word "failing" came up.

15:35.368 --> 15:37.704
I'd say it's time for
threats and intimidation.

15:37.737 --> 15:39.606
Well, did you already do it?

15:39.639 --> 15:41.574
Not yet.

15:41.608 --> 15:43.910
I saved it all for you.

15:43.943 --> 15:44.877
I love you.

15:51.551 --> 15:52.785
It's open.

15:52.819 --> 15:55.722
I hope you're
doing your homework.

15:55.755 --> 15:56.656
Hope springs eternal.

16:00.593 --> 16:01.995
So what's this
I hear about some

16:02.029 --> 16:06.499
threatening your solid D
average that we're so proud of?

16:06.533 --> 16:07.400
No, it's OK.

16:07.434 --> 16:08.768
I got it under control.

16:08.801 --> 16:10.503
Well, I hope you didn't
do nothing to that teacher

16:10.537 --> 16:13.006
that they can trace back to me.

16:13.040 --> 16:13.973
Don't worry.

16:14.007 --> 16:15.408
I'm not going to
flunk anything, OK?

16:15.442 --> 16:19.146
I can still hold my
head high in detention.

16:19.179 --> 16:21.948
What's this?

16:21.981 --> 16:24.151
What are you sending a money
order to the Board of Education

16:24.184 --> 16:24.984
for?

16:27.654 --> 16:29.956
It's for my high
school equivalency test.

16:29.989 --> 16:32.259
I need it to go to
this writing school.

16:32.292 --> 16:34.561
What writing school?

16:34.594 --> 16:37.630
- In New York.
- Excuse me.

16:37.664 --> 16:38.465
Have we met?

16:42.402 --> 16:43.503
You don't need to do anything.

16:43.536 --> 16:45.138
Cousin Ronnie said she'd
pay for the whole thing,

16:45.172 --> 16:46.873
and I could stay with
her and everything.

16:46.906 --> 16:49.076
God, that is so
tacky, Darlene.

16:49.109 --> 16:51.244
It's not like this family don't
look bad enough without you

16:51.278 --> 16:53.580
panhandling the relatives.

16:53.613 --> 16:54.481
Well, I didn't ask.

16:54.514 --> 16:55.482
She offered.

16:55.515 --> 16:56.616
No way.

16:56.649 --> 16:58.851
You are not leaving this
house until you're 18.

16:58.885 --> 17:00.953
Then me and your dad are
going to kick you out

17:00.987 --> 17:01.954
like we always planned.

17:04.957 --> 17:07.394
Well, you wanted to get out
of Lanford when you were my age.

17:07.427 --> 17:08.995
Yeah, but it's
all built up now.

17:13.566 --> 17:15.535
Why you have to ruin my life?

17:15.568 --> 17:17.770
Because I lost
the coin toss, OK?

17:17.804 --> 17:18.705
Your dad got DJ.

17:23.510 --> 17:26.646
Where do I put something
called "potato buds"?

17:26.679 --> 17:28.315
Why don't you put
them through college?

17:28.348 --> 17:29.149
What?

17:31.818 --> 17:33.753
Yeah, why don't you
dangle something real pretty

17:33.786 --> 17:36.223
in front of them, encourage
them to drop out of school,

17:36.256 --> 17:38.858
and then turn them
against their parents?

17:38.891 --> 17:41.294
This isn't about
potato buds, is it?

17:41.328 --> 17:43.463
You know, Dan
and me don't like

17:43.496 --> 17:47.400
it when people offer our kids
money to run away from home.

17:47.434 --> 17:49.536
We feel like if they're
gonna run away from home,

17:49.569 --> 17:52.572
they should save up
the money themselves.

17:52.605 --> 17:56.243
See, we're trying to
instill values here.

17:56.276 --> 17:57.510
Look, I don't
mean to criticize

17:57.544 --> 17:58.545
your methods, Roseanne.

17:58.578 --> 18:00.513
But if you were
trying to thank me,

18:00.547 --> 18:02.882
you're going about
it the wrong way.

18:02.915 --> 18:04.784
Oh, I'm sorry.

18:04.817 --> 18:07.120
Let me thank you for
going behind my back

18:07.154 --> 18:09.122
and filling my daughter's
head with all kinds of ideas

18:09.156 --> 18:11.658
that I have to run
upstairs and say no to.

18:11.691 --> 18:13.326
Why do you want to say to her?

18:13.360 --> 18:15.562
Maybe it's the
best thing for her.

18:15.595 --> 18:17.797
You have known the
girl for 10 minutes.

18:17.830 --> 18:19.766
How could you possibly
know what's best for her?

18:19.799 --> 18:21.668
I've lived with her
for 50, 60 years,

18:21.701 --> 18:24.437
and I have no idea
what's best for her.

18:24.471 --> 18:26.406
Maybe you don't know
this about Darlene,

18:26.439 --> 18:28.608
but she wants to be a writer.

18:28.641 --> 18:30.277
Well, of course she
wants to be a writer.

18:30.310 --> 18:33.446
She's 16 years old and a
sophomore in high school.

18:33.480 --> 18:35.915
Last year she wanted to
be a basketball star.

18:35.948 --> 18:37.750
Hey, DJ wants to be a cowboy.

18:37.784 --> 18:40.553
You want to run out
and buy him a horse?

18:40.587 --> 18:41.954
I'm sorry, Rosie.

18:41.988 --> 18:43.790
You know, I really thought
I was doing the right thing,

18:43.823 --> 18:45.124
but I'll take care of it.

18:45.158 --> 18:47.093
I'll just go upstairs and tell
her the whole thing's off.

18:47.126 --> 18:49.496
No, you're going up, and
you're giving her the ideas.

18:49.529 --> 18:51.931
And then you go up there
and take them away.

18:51.964 --> 18:55.202
You know, you really haven't
changed very much in 25 years.

18:55.235 --> 18:56.536
While you're up there
why don't you just

18:56.569 --> 18:58.137
tell DJ that his horse is dead?

19:00.940 --> 19:02.809
Come on, Rosie.

19:02.842 --> 19:05.412
You just hate the fact that
one of your kids looks up to me

19:05.445 --> 19:07.214
more than they do to you.

19:07.247 --> 19:09.048
I think it's time you got to
know your daughter better.

19:09.081 --> 19:10.850
She certainly opens
up to strangers.

19:10.883 --> 19:13.420
Well, maybe she takes after
your side of the family.

19:13.453 --> 19:17.724
Oh, we all know what
this is about, don't we?

19:17.757 --> 19:20.293
You're just jealous, because
I've made something of myself.

19:20.327 --> 19:22.829
Yeah, an ass.

19:22.862 --> 19:24.764
And where do you get that
hoity-toity accent, anyway?

19:24.797 --> 19:25.665
I mean, you're from Illinois.

19:30.737 --> 19:32.605
You've been talking
that way ever

19:32.639 --> 19:35.842
since you did that stupid
play in high school.

19:35.875 --> 19:40.480
Well, I'm sorry I don't
have your dulcet tones.

19:40.513 --> 19:43.216
I can't believe that I
wasted 25 years hating you

19:43.250 --> 19:45.518
for something as stupid
as a wedding, when

19:45.552 --> 19:48.488
there's really a very
good reason to hate you--

19:48.521 --> 19:49.322
you're a bitch!

19:55.528 --> 19:57.997
I'm a bitch?

19:58.030 --> 20:02.535
I bow to the queen
of all bitches.

20:02.569 --> 20:05.071
Hey, you want to know why
I didn't want you to be

20:05.104 --> 20:06.706
a bridesmaid at my wedding?

20:06.739 --> 20:08.174
Because there wasn't
enough tangerine

20:08.207 --> 20:11.511
chiffon in the whole state of
Illinois to make your dress.

20:17.450 --> 20:18.251
Good one.

20:31.564 --> 20:33.766
You left out your middle name.

20:33.800 --> 20:37.637
Oh, um, I don't have one.

20:37.670 --> 20:40.239
David.

20:40.273 --> 20:42.342
Come on, the school will
still accept our applications

20:42.375 --> 20:45.645
without our middle name.

20:45.678 --> 20:47.714
It's Maurice.

20:47.747 --> 20:52.552
[laughing] Thank
your parents for me.

20:52.585 --> 20:54.821
Are you sure you mom
doesn't know what we're doing?

20:54.854 --> 20:58.925
Nah, she probably thinks
we're out somewhere having sex.

20:58.958 --> 21:02.362
Amazing, because I can't
imagine it, even if I try.

21:05.665 --> 21:07.300
Well, does this help?

21:07.334 --> 21:08.301
Maurice!

21:08.335 --> 21:09.135
Maurice!

21:12.505 --> 21:13.673
I don't know
about this, Darlene.

21:13.706 --> 21:16.008
The school's all
the way in New York.

21:16.042 --> 21:17.544
Where we going to stay?

21:17.577 --> 21:19.045
Well, if my mom
hasn't completely

21:19.078 --> 21:20.447
blown the thing
with cousin Ronnie,
