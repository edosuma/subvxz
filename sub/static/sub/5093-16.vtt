Two-point game, kid-- you better

Can we just play
the game, Danny?

00:14.029 --> 00:15.278
Well, it looks
like we can play.

00:15.280 --> 00:16.779
I don't know if you can.
Too bad your jump shot

00:16.781 --> 00:18.531
isn't half as good as your trash talking.
Oh, my jump shot?

00:18.533 --> 00:20.816
Yeah.
My jump shot's about to make me 50 bucks,

00:20.818 --> 00:21.918
and it's gonna come
from your pocket.

00:21.920 --> 00:23.286
I'm not worried.
Yeah?

00:23.288 --> 00:24.671
You haven't made it from 20

00:34.716 --> 00:35.765
What the hell was that?

00:35.767 --> 00:37.183
What the hell was what?
That's like

00:37.185 --> 00:38.635
the fifth time
you body-slammed me today.

00:38.637 --> 00:41.020
Quit crying, old man.
DANNY: Hey, it was a hard foul.

00:41.022 --> 00:41.971
Take it easy.
You're high.

00:41.973 --> 00:43.172
That was all ball.
Hey, Jamie,

00:43.174 --> 00:44.274
talk to your teammate.

00:44.276 --> 00:45.308
He's been hacking my guys
all day.

00:45.310 --> 00:47.443
It was a foul.
Oh, come on.

00:47.445 --> 00:48.695
Only looked like a foul
'cause this

00:48.697 --> 00:50.063
fat slob couldn't
stay on his feet.

00:50.065 --> 00:51.064
What'd you just call me?

00:51.066 --> 00:52.482
I'm pretty sure
I called you a fat slob.

00:52.484 --> 00:53.950
Why, you prefer
lard-ass?

00:53.952 --> 00:55.451
Say it one more time.
Call me fat one more time.

00:55.453 --> 00:56.519
Why? What are you gonna do?

01:08.833 --> 01:10.717
(panting)

01:10.719 --> 01:12.251
All right, all right.

01:12.253 --> 01:15.204
Is he all right?

01:22.546 --> 01:24.880
Commissioner, in the four years
since you've held this office,

01:24.882 --> 01:26.683
violent crime in
the city is down

01:26.685 --> 01:28.735
over 20% across
the board.

01:28.737 --> 01:31.404
Are these numbers we
should be happy with?

01:31.406 --> 01:33.740
Relative to when
I started, sure.

01:33.742 --> 01:35.024
Well, how low can you go?

01:35.026 --> 01:36.225
In a perfect world?

01:36.227 --> 01:37.343
Zero.

01:37.345 --> 01:39.412
But we don't live
in a perfect world.

01:39.414 --> 01:41.114
Well, what's your target?

01:41.116 --> 01:42.615
It's a moving target.

01:42.617 --> 01:44.701
I'd be a fool to set a number.

01:44.703 --> 01:46.869
We just take it
one day, one block,

01:46.871 --> 01:49.539
one successful intervention
at a time.

01:49.541 --> 01:52.542
Even if that means violating
civil liberties along the way?

01:52.544 --> 01:54.761
Like with stop and frisk?

01:56.030 --> 01:58.514
Stop, question and frisk.

01:58.516 --> 02:01.684
Our critics always leave out
that important second word.

02:01.686 --> 02:04.354
The fact is, most stops
don't end in searches,

02:04.356 --> 02:07.140
but when they do,
they're fruitful.

02:07.142 --> 02:10.759
Last year, we took back
more than 800 illegal guns.

02:10.762 --> 02:13.396
And stepped on quite a few toes.

02:13.398 --> 02:14.947
I can live
with some hurt feelings

02:14.949 --> 02:16.816
if we've prevented
more serious harm.

02:16.818 --> 02:18.484
That's not what the guy
in this job

02:18.486 --> 02:21.037

or he wouldn't be in it.

02:21.039 --> 02:22.655
What do you lose sleep over?

02:23.624 --> 02:25.875
What I can't see coming.

02:25.877 --> 02:30.046
And hoping that I make
the right moves when it does.

02:30.998 --> 02:32.915
Well, that's a heavy load

02:32.917 --> 02:34.584

02:34.586 --> 02:36.335

03:23.101 --> 03:24.834
I don't know why I did that.
You did it

03:24.836 --> 03:26.969
because he was being an ass,
just like anybody else would've.

03:26.971 --> 03:27.882
How is he?

03:27.907 --> 03:29.106
He's got a broken nose
and a concussion.

03:29.107 --> 03:30.339
He's on the way

03:30.341 --> 03:32.191

Is he gonna be okay?

03:32.193 --> 03:33.943
Hey, we need to talk.

03:33.945 --> 03:36.011

03:39.567 --> 03:40.700
What? What kind of problem?

03:40.702 --> 03:42.184
He wants to press charges.

03:42.186 --> 03:43.185
Whoa, what do you mean?

03:43.187 --> 03:44.487
What are you talking about,
press charges?

03:44.489 --> 03:45.655
He started
the whole thing, kid.

03:45.657 --> 03:46.956
He's a lawyer.
He knows the drill.

03:46.958 --> 03:48.074
Technically, Bobby
assaulted him.

03:48.076 --> 03:49.242
He wants him arrested.

03:49.244 --> 03:51.461
Well, you know what,
I suggest you climb on the bus

03:51.463 --> 03:53.045
with him and talk
some sense into him.

03:53.047 --> 03:54.797
I already tried.
He's insisting.

03:54.799 --> 03:57.800
You know, kid, none of your
lawyer friends next time, okay?

03:57.802 --> 03:58.968
Co and firemen only.

03:58.970 --> 04:00.035
Everything okay?

04:00.037 --> 04:02.171
No, Bobby,
everything's not okay.

04:02.173 --> 04:03.556

What time is Dad
coming to get me?

04:23.161 --> 04:26.028
He said 10:00, so I'd plan
on being ready at noon.

04:26.030 --> 04:28.698
Mom, he's busy. That's why
he's always running late.

04:28.700 --> 04:31.066
Take a look at this.

04:31.068 --> 04:32.201
What, your schedule?

04:32.203 --> 04:33.953
Yeah.
Riveting.

04:33.955 --> 04:36.539
The point being,
I'm busy, too, Nicky.

I should wait here.

Rebekah?

I think she went
to the ladies' room.

04:46.885 --> 04:47.967
Okay.

I don't understand.

07:32.585 --> 07:35.536
I also know how

07:35.538 --> 07:38.038
desperate the need
for closure is,

07:38.040 --> 07:40.925

to believe that someone

07:40.927 --> 07:43.427
is responsible,

07:43.429 --> 07:46.263
it doesn't mean that they are.

07:46.265 --> 07:49.383
Ms. Reagan, you're
the assistant district attorney.

of law enforcement

07:53.172 --> 07:54.722

07:54.724 --> 07:56.307
Now, when I
saw your name

07:56.309 --> 07:58.342

I knew

07:58.344 --> 07:59.643
it was a sign.

07:59.645 --> 08:03.697
I didn't hesitate
to give up that donation.

08:03.699 --> 08:06.734
I'm not doing this for closure.

08:06.736 --> 08:09.453

08:09.455 --> 08:11.989
And with all due respect,

08:33.346 --> 08:34.510
This is nuts.

08:34.513 --> 08:36.597
Well, not for nothing,
but you did crack the guy,

08:36.599 --> 08:37.815
and technically,
that's assault.

08:37.817 --> 08:39.383
I cracked him
'cause he was insulting me.

08:39.385 --> 08:40.683
'Cause-cause he was

Come on, Danny, you would've
done the same thing.

08:44.991 --> 08:46.223
Yeah, I probably would've.

08:46.225 --> 08:48.442
So, then, what the hell
are we talking about here?

08:48.444 --> 08:49.777
I have no choice, Bobby.

08:49.779 --> 08:51.161
The guy is pressing charges,

08:51.163 --> 08:52.746
the law says
I got to collar you,

08:52.748 --> 08:53.948
and that's what I'm gonna do.

08:53.950 --> 08:55.950
The law is supposed
to protect people, Danny,

08:55.952 --> 08:57.567
not hurt them.
I know.

08:59.254 --> 09:01.755
If it was up to me, I'd
cut you loose right now.

09:01.757 --> 09:03.407
But I can't.

09:03.409 --> 09:05.259
I'm gonna do
the next best thing, okay?

09:05.261 --> 09:08.128
I called my sister down.
We'll see what she can do.

09:08.130 --> 09:10.014
You think she'll be
able to squash this?

09:10.016 --> 09:11.548
I don't know. It's up to her.

09:11.550 --> 09:13.934
But I'm gonna talk to her
on your behalf.

09:13.936 --> 09:15.686
I'll get the other
guys to do the same.

09:15.688 --> 09:16.920
We'll tell her you
didn't start this thing.

09:16.922 --> 09:18.722
And that-that'll be enough?
You got nothing

09:18.724 --> 09:21.258
on your record, right?
Right.

09:21.260 --> 09:23.394
Okay, well, the D.A.'s office
should look favorably upon that.

09:23.396 --> 09:24.478
My guess is you'll be home

09:24.480 --> 09:25.863
in time for dinner
with the family.

09:25.865 --> 09:27.064
What about my job?

09:27.066 --> 09:28.615
I mean, I'm supposed
to be at work right now.

09:28.617 --> 09:30.534
If they find out I missed a day
'cause I got arrested,

09:30.536 --> 09:31.618
I could be out of a job.

09:31.620 --> 09:33.070
Hey, hey, I'll call your boss.

09:33.072 --> 09:35.272
I'll tell him you're a witness
on a case or something.

09:35.274 --> 09:36.735
I'll call Gina and tell her
what's going on.

09:36.760 --> 09:37.459
Yeah?

09:37.460 --> 09:39.243
My sister's here.
Let me go talk to her.

09:39.245 --> 09:41.778
We'll get this straightened
out, all right?

09:41.780 --> 09:43.998
Take care of him, please.

09:46.617 --> 09:48.285
How's your buddy
holding up?

09:48.287 --> 09:49.586
Not so good.

09:49.588 --> 09:51.338
Well, I guess he should
have thought about that

09:51.340 --> 09:52.639
before he cracked
somebody's head open.

09:52.641 --> 09:55.392
Come on, that's not even
how it went down, okay?

09:55.394 --> 09:56.643
Jamie's buddy started
the whole thing,

09:56.645 --> 09:59.263
and Jamie will tell you same.
Mm-hmm.

09:59.265 --> 10:01.798
Does he have any priors?

10:01.800 --> 10:02.850
No.

10:02.852 --> 10:05.352
Come on, look,
this is a good guy, okay?

10:05.354 --> 10:06.487
We've played
basketball together

10:06.489 --> 10:08.138
once a week for years.

10:08.140 --> 10:09.690
He's a family man.
He's a local electrician.

10:09.692 --> 10:10.774
He's not a criminal.

10:10.776 --> 10:12.693
You arrested him.

10:12.695 --> 10:14.144
I arrested him
because Jamie's friend

10:14.146 --> 10:16.413
was going off the deep end
about pressing charges.

10:16.415 --> 10:18.499
How's the complainant?

10:18.501 --> 10:21.502
You know, he's apparently got
a concussion and a broken nose.

10:21.504 --> 10:24.204
Can't say he didn't deserve it.

10:25.173 --> 10:27.007
Okay, assuming what
you tell me checks out,

10:27.009 --> 10:28.926
I think we can avoid
the grand jury,

10:28.928 --> 10:30.160
charge him with
a misdemeanor,

10:30.162 --> 10:32.262
and he could be out
by the afternoon.

10:32.264 --> 10:33.714
Okay. Thank you.

10:33.716 --> 10:35.182
Well, there's no
need to thank me.

10:35.184 --> 10:36.550
I'm not doing
you any favors.

10:36.552 --> 10:37.684
It's strictly by the book.

10:37.686 --> 10:39.053
Well, thank you anyway.

10:39.055 --> 10:40.437
You're welcome.

10:40.439 --> 10:42.689
Now, can we talk
about my thing?

10:42.691 --> 10:45.476
What? Richard Rourke? Seriously?

10:45.478 --> 10:48.178
I mean, I don't have enough
active cases as it is?

10:48.180 --> 10:49.813
You want me
to resurrect a dead one?

10:49.815 --> 10:52.282
I know it's a big ask,
but after all these years,

10:52.284 --> 10:55.069
he is still in so much pain
from losing his only daughter.

10:55.071 --> 10:56.186
I just want to help.

10:56.188 --> 10:58.872
You really think
Richard Rourke is a murderer?

10:58.874 --> 11:00.290
I mean, look,

11:00.292 --> 11:02.993
the guy may be a party
boy and a skirt chaser,

11:02.995 --> 11:04.962
but he's also a
pillar of society.

11:04.964 --> 11:07.164
I mean, he's not exactly
public enemy number one.

11:07.166 --> 11:10.200
I know. I just want to be able
to look Mr. Anderson in the eye

11:10.202 --> 11:11.718
and say we did
everything we could.

11:11.720 --> 11:12.719
Oh, my goodness.

11:12.721 --> 11:14.555
Come on, Danny.
Yeah, all right.

11:14.557 --> 11:18.058
I'll take a look at his
case file and see what's there.

11:18.060 --> 11:19.760
And that is the best I can do.

11:19.762 --> 11:21.044
That's good enough for me.

11:21.046 --> 11:23.213
All right.

11:29.720 --> 11:31.688
(door opening)

11:31.690 --> 11:33.890
Deputy Commissioner Moore
to see you, sir.

11:49.090 --> 11:51.508
Those remarks were pulled
from an opposition memo

11:51.510 --> 11:53.460
I wrote during the
mayoral election

11:53.462 --> 11:55.345
when I was working
for the opposition.

11:55.347 --> 11:58.265
We were in the weeds,
looking for ways

11:58.267 --> 12:00.884
to frame your guy as defective.

12:00.886 --> 12:04.054
I knew it was a cheap shot
soon as I wrote it up.

12:04.056 --> 12:05.522
What I didn't
know is that it

12:05.524 --> 12:07.274
would ever see
the light of day.

12:07.276 --> 12:10.194
But it did, and I'm
very sorry about that.

12:10.196 --> 12:12.696
And I'll also
admit that it was

12:12.698 --> 12:14.815
very hard work for
me to turn the facts

12:14.817 --> 12:17.201
as I had them into
that portrait of you.

12:17.203 --> 12:18.368
Good, hard work?

12:18.370 --> 12:20.871
Dirty work, yes.
There it is.

12:20.873 --> 12:23.240
Do you also think
I have a thin skin, Garrett?

12:23.242 --> 12:24.875
What do you mean, "also?"

12:24.877 --> 12:26.443
Beside having
the mentality of--

12:26.445 --> 12:28.612
what was it--
a bullheaded union boss?

12:28.614 --> 12:31.965
Frank, I just said I twisted
the facts to serve a purpose.

12:31.967 --> 12:34.635
Which is one definition
of what you do for a living.

12:34.637 --> 12:36.220
Okay, sure.

12:36.222 --> 12:37.304
And you're good at it.

12:37.306 --> 12:38.505
Thank you?

12:38.507 --> 12:40.424
So you don't think
I have a thin skin?

12:40.426 --> 12:42.309
No, I don't.
What do you want from me here?

12:42.311 --> 12:43.393
To move on.

12:43.395 --> 12:45.429
Just... move on?

12:45.431 --> 12:47.297
I have. You should.

12:47.299 --> 12:48.932
You messing with me?

12:48.934 --> 12:51.801
Nope.

12:52.654 --> 12:55.656
Just one thing.

12:55.658 --> 12:57.641
Beresford's ambush interview
isn't slated

12:57.643 --> 12:59.159
to air until this weekend.

12:59.161 --> 13:01.745
It's a date. You bring the beer,
I'll make the popcorn.

13:01.747 --> 13:03.780
His news director
is a friend of mine.

13:03.782 --> 13:06.116
A friend who owes me
more than one favor.

13:06.118 --> 13:09.319
We are not
killing this interview.

13:09.321 --> 13:12.005
Why not? It's not like
this is legitimate news here.

13:12.007 --> 13:14.925
Because I don't want to be the
kid who's taking his ball home

13:14.927 --> 13:16.843
because he doesn't think
the game is going well.

13:16.845 --> 13:18.929
Frank, my job...
Garrett...

13:18.931 --> 13:21.348
You're gonna cut off your nose
to spite your face?

13:21.350 --> 13:24.101
I am standing behind my word.

13:24.103 --> 13:28.188
I'll be in my office
if you come to your senses.

13:28.190 --> 13:30.340
(sighs)

13:32.393 --> 13:35.028
DANNY: What the hell do you mean,
there's no case file?

13:35.030 --> 13:36.280
There's got to be.

13:36.282 --> 13:37.648
I had them check three times.

13:37.650 --> 13:39.015
I'm telling you,
it's not there.

13:39.017 --> 13:40.183
Well, where the hell is it?

13:40.185 --> 13:41.451
Apparently, there
was a small fire

13:41.453 --> 13:42.653
in the records
room a while back.

13:42.655 --> 13:44.521
Some cases got lost.
This was one of them.

13:44.523 --> 13:46.440
Well, that explains why
Cold Case never picked it up.

13:46.442 --> 13:47.824
Who was the case detective?

13:47.826 --> 13:50.160
Your old buddy, Gerry O'Grady.
Gerry O' Grady.

13:50.162 --> 13:51.378
Well, you, uh,
okay with me

13:51.380 --> 13:52.913
taking a day trip
to the Rockaways?

13:52.915 --> 13:54.915
Do I have to drive with you?
No.

13:54.917 --> 13:57.751
Knock yourself out.

14:27.465 --> 14:30.350
♪

14:34.372 --> 14:36.506
(sighs)

14:41.663 --> 14:44.097
Well, if this is what
retirement looks like,

14:44.099 --> 14:45.766
I think I'm gonna
stay working.

14:45.768 --> 14:48.418
Well, if it isn't Danny Reagan.

14:48.420 --> 14:49.686
Brought you some joe.

14:49.688 --> 14:51.054
Thanks, Danny.

14:51.056 --> 14:53.774
I'm real sorry for what
happened to you guys up here.

14:53.776 --> 14:55.225
What are you gonna do?

14:55.227 --> 14:57.060
Hurricane Sandy was some
piece of work.

14:57.085 --> 14:58.095
Yeah, it was.

14:58.096 --> 14:59.646
But we're back on our feet.

14:59.648 --> 15:00.731
That's what counts, right?

15:00.733 --> 15:03.099
Damn straight.
(chuckling)

15:03.101 --> 15:04.451
Got your message.

15:04.453 --> 15:05.532
You're looking into
the Jenny Anderson case.

15:05.557 --> 15:06.287
Right.

15:06.288 --> 15:07.537
I read some newspaper articles,

15:07.539 --> 15:09.990
said you liked a local
burglary crew for the murder.

15:09.992 --> 15:11.908
Yeah, that's right.

15:11.910 --> 15:14.795
Looked like she just came home
in the middle of a burglary.

15:14.797 --> 15:17.113
Mm-hmm.
There was a struggle, they slammed her

15:17.115 --> 15:19.966
against the wall pretty hard.
That was it.

15:19.968 --> 15:22.285
She was DOA at the scene.
Right.

15:22.287 --> 15:23.470
But you also looked
at Richard Rourke.

15:23.472 --> 15:25.055
Uh, what can you
tell me about him?

15:25.057 --> 15:26.456
He's rich.

15:26.458 --> 15:29.125
The truth is,

15:29.127 --> 15:31.645
for a master-of-the-universe
type, he wasn't so bad.

15:31.647 --> 15:33.814
Really?
I remember he was

15:33.816 --> 15:35.682
really a wreck
over that girl dying.

15:35.684 --> 15:37.100
But you didn't like him for it?

15:37.102 --> 15:39.653
Pretty young girl
shows up dead in her apartment.

15:39.655 --> 15:41.772
Nine times out of ten,
it's the boyfriend, right?

15:41.774 --> 15:43.774
Right.
But...

15:43.776 --> 15:45.275
his alibi was solid.

15:45.277 --> 15:48.028
Mm-hmm.
He was, um, at the movies with a buddy.

15:48.030 --> 15:49.996
This buddy-- do you
remember his name?

15:49.998 --> 15:52.315
Uh, sorry, Danny. I...

15:52.317 --> 15:54.918
But they were tight.

15:54.920 --> 15:57.170
Rourke even put him
to work at the company,

15:57.172 --> 15:59.172
working out of the mail room.

15:59.174 --> 16:01.758
Really? And you confirmed
this movie alibi, right?

16:01.760 --> 16:03.176
That's why you cleared him?

16:03.178 --> 16:05.262
It wasn't the only reason.

16:05.264 --> 16:08.832
Rourke volunteered
to take a lie detector test

16:08.834 --> 16:10.934
and passed with flying colors.

16:12.220 --> 16:14.003
Look, Danny,

16:14.005 --> 16:16.773
back then, we were working
15 homicides a week.

16:16.775 --> 16:18.308
Tell me about it.

16:18.310 --> 16:20.310
Is it possible something slipped
through the cracks?

16:20.312 --> 16:22.345
Yeah, I guess so.
Hmm.

16:22.347 --> 16:24.398
But I don't think so.

16:24.400 --> 16:25.515
(phone ringing)

16:25.517 --> 16:27.367
Look, I got to grab this.
Yeah.

16:27.369 --> 16:29.152
You hang in there,
all right?

16:29.154 --> 16:30.871
Good lucky, Danny.
You, too.

16:30.873 --> 16:31.988
Thanks.

16:31.990 --> 16:33.156
Hey, I was just
about to call you.

16:33.158 --> 16:35.125
Hey, you might want
to get down here.

16:35.127 --> 16:36.076
Your buddy's going to jail.

16:36.078 --> 16:37.477
What? Why?

16:37.479 --> 16:38.779
His prints came back.

16:38.781 --> 16:40.380
He's got a prior arrest, Danny.

16:40.382 --> 16:42.582
(sighs)
I'm on my way.

16:44.034 --> 16:46.035
JUDGE:
Bail is set

16:46.037 --> 16:47.671
for $30,000.

16:47.673 --> 16:48.922
Bobby?

16:48.924 --> 16:50.223
Case number 124.

16:50.225 --> 16:51.675
(sighs)
Bobby, why didn't you tell me?

16:51.677 --> 16:52.843
I'm sorry, Danny.

16:52.845 --> 16:54.060
It was so long ago,

16:54.062 --> 16:56.680
I didn't even know
it was still on my record.

17:00.067 --> 17:02.602
$30,000?

17:02.604 --> 17:03.770
The guy's an electrician.

17:03.772 --> 17:05.021
Where the hell is he gonna get
that kind of money?

17:05.022 --> 17:07.073
His prior is for the same
charge-- felony assault.

17:07.075 --> 17:09.943
We have no choice but to
bring him to the grand jury.

17:09.944 --> 17:13.029
They're sending him to Rikers
Island. He's not a criminal.

17:13.031 --> 17:14.231
That's where
real criminals go.

17:14.232 --> 17:15.281
We don't write the laws.

17:15.284 --> 17:17.451
We enforce them.
Oh, come on.

17:32.886 --> 17:34.887
GINA:
This is crazy, Danny.

17:34.889 --> 17:37.232
This prior arrest is a stupid
bar fight from college.

17:37.235 --> 17:38.484
It was 100 years ago.

17:38.486 --> 17:40.803
I know, but on paper,
it makes it look

17:40.805 --> 17:42.522
like Bobby's got
a propensity for violence.

17:42.524 --> 17:44.023
But he doesn't.
You know that.

17:44.025 --> 17:45.908
Anyone who knows
Bobby knows that.

17:45.910 --> 17:47.443
I-I know that,
but unfortunately,

17:47.445 --> 17:49.495
it does complicate things, Gina.

17:49.497 --> 17:52.198
Danny, he left this morning
to play a basketball game,

17:52.200 --> 17:53.649
and now he's
going to jail?

17:53.651 --> 17:55.034
What am I supposed to do?

17:55.036 --> 17:57.503
Wha... What am I supposed
to tell the kids?

17:57.505 --> 17:59.839
We're working on it, okay?
We're doing what we can.

17:59.841 --> 18:01.490
He can't go to
jail, Danny.

18:01.492 --> 18:03.509
He won't make it.
You know he won't.

18:03.511 --> 18:04.711
I know. I know he won't.

18:04.713 --> 18:07.263
Look, just hang
in there, okay?

18:07.265 --> 18:09.165
I'll be in touch.

18:09.167 --> 18:11.134
Danny.
Hey.

18:11.136 --> 18:13.886
I'm sorry. There was nothing
any of us could have done.

18:13.888 --> 18:16.005
I know. Just... things.

18:16.007 --> 18:18.507
Our jobs are supposed to help
people, not screw them over.

18:18.509 --> 18:19.559
Let me handle this.

18:19.561 --> 18:20.943
I want to talk
to Ken again, and see

18:20.945 --> 18:22.678
if I can get him to think
about dropping the charges.

18:22.680 --> 18:25.014
You already talked to Ken
before, kid. It didn't work.

18:25.016 --> 18:26.566
Yeah, well,
I'm gonna try it again.

18:26.568 --> 18:28.117
All right, just be careful.

18:28.119 --> 18:30.203
No one's tampering with
a complainant on my watch, okay?

18:30.205 --> 18:32.238
I'm not talking about
twisting anybody's arm.

18:32.240 --> 18:34.874
He's my friend. We're gonna have
a polite conversation, okay?

18:34.876 --> 18:36.209
Okay. (sighs)

18:36.211 --> 18:38.027
You think
he's gonna come through?

18:38.029 --> 18:39.996
No, but at least
he's trying.

18:39.998 --> 18:43.532
Okay, so can we talk
about my Anderson case?

18:43.534 --> 18:46.035
Well, I think you got
a dead end there, sis.

18:46.037 --> 18:48.087
Well...
Rourke took a polygraph test,

18:48.089 --> 18:50.373
and he aced it
with flying colors.

18:52.209 --> 18:53.893
(sighs)

18:57.981 --> 18:59.899
Erin, welcome.
Come on in.

18:59.901 --> 19:01.217
Thank you, Nathan.

19:01.219 --> 19:03.186
This is my brother,
Detective Danny Reagan.

19:03.188 --> 19:04.887
Good to meet you.
Sir.

19:04.889 --> 19:06.389
Have a seat, please.

19:11.111 --> 19:12.561
The bearer of bad news?

19:12.563 --> 19:14.447
Uh, I'm afraid so.

19:14.449 --> 19:16.999
Uh, Richard Rourke
has a pretty solid alibi, sir,

19:17.001 --> 19:19.285
and he also aced a polygraph,

19:19.287 --> 19:21.371
which makes him highly
unlikely for this.

19:21.373 --> 19:22.905
ERIN:
We're sorry, Nathan.

19:22.907 --> 19:25.074
We wanted
to tell you in person.

19:25.076 --> 19:27.844
These polygraph tests--

19:27.846 --> 19:30.847
they're not 100%
accurate, are they?

19:30.849 --> 19:32.248
They're not perfect, no.

19:32.250 --> 19:36.619
If someone had access
to one of those machines, um,

19:36.621 --> 19:39.389
it's possible
they could outsmart it?

19:41.191 --> 19:43.443
I don't mean any disrespect
here, sir,

19:43.445 --> 19:46.062
but I'm not sure
what you're getting at.

19:46.064 --> 19:47.280
Do you have reason to suspect

19:47.282 --> 19:49.449
that Richard Rourke
had access to a polygraph?

19:49.451 --> 19:50.933
Rourke's father,
Preston--

19:50.935 --> 19:52.251
he wanted to make sure

19:52.253 --> 19:54.704
his son knew every
aspect of his business.

19:54.706 --> 19:57.490
And the year
that Jenny was murdered,

19:57.492 --> 20:00.042
Richard was working
in Human Resources.

20:00.044 --> 20:02.245
Human Resources
being the department

20:02.247 --> 20:04.914
that would administer the
polygraph to its employees?

20:06.049 --> 20:10.470
So, what if he learned
how to manipulate the outcome?

20:10.472 --> 20:13.055
What if that's the reason
why he volunteered

20:13.057 --> 20:16.259
in the first place to
take the polygraph test?

20:16.261 --> 20:18.644
That's a lot of if's, sir.

20:19.680 --> 20:21.681
Here's another one
for you, Danny.

20:21.683 --> 20:24.600
What if we were talking
about <i>your</i> child?

20:28.489 --> 20:30.690
We'll dig a little
deeper, okay?

20:30.692 --> 20:32.742
Thank you.

20:32.744 --> 20:33.860
You're welcome.

20:33.862 --> 20:34.994
But we need

20:34.996 --> 20:36.746
something from you as well.

20:36.748 --> 20:38.164
Sure. What's that?

20:38.166 --> 20:39.832
Rourke's alibi
is pretty tight.

20:39.834 --> 20:42.084
We need a name.
We don't have one.

20:42.086 --> 20:44.487
And we can't exactly go up
to Rourke and ask him

20:44.489 --> 20:46.005
without him getting suspicious.

20:46.007 --> 20:48.324
Peter Blake.

20:48.326 --> 20:50.710
Peter was Richard's best friend.

20:52.162 --> 20:54.046
Okay.

20:54.048 --> 20:55.598
Thanks.

20:58.185 --> 20:59.769
Frank, I need
a minute.

20:59.771 --> 21:02.305
Baker, is the DCPI
on my schedule?

21:02.307 --> 21:04.440
No, sir. This is a drive-by.

21:04.442 --> 21:05.841
We need to talk about
Beresford's interview.

21:05.843 --> 21:07.276
What we need to talk about

21:07.278 --> 21:10.029
is the chain of command
and who's at the top of it.

21:10.031 --> 21:11.063
You are, sir.

21:11.065 --> 21:12.365
Does my DCPI know that?

21:12.367 --> 21:14.350
I imagine he
does, sir.

21:14.352 --> 21:15.818
You say something?
Not yet.

21:15.820 --> 21:18.854
I specifically told you not
to kill that interview, right?

21:18.856 --> 21:20.206
Right. But it was wrong.

21:20.208 --> 21:21.741
Really?
My phone's ringing.

21:21.743 --> 21:24.293
Wrong by what measure?
Wrong in whose opinion?

21:24.295 --> 21:27.029
By any sensible measure
and in my expert opinion.

21:27.031 --> 21:28.881
You're doing that thing
you do when you try

21:28.883 --> 21:30.917
and teach someone a lesson
by hurting your own cause.

21:30.919 --> 21:33.219
Oh, is that right?
Yes. The crap he quoted

21:33.221 --> 21:34.703
is on my head; I own that.

21:34.705 --> 21:36.556
You don't need to nail
yourself to the cross

21:36.558 --> 21:38.674
for me to get it--
so I had them

21:38.676 --> 21:39.976
edit it out.
Tried to.

21:39.978 --> 21:42.512
Had them.
Before I had them put it back in.

21:42.514 --> 21:43.763
Insisted.

21:43.765 --> 21:45.765
For a guy who's carried a gun
most of his life,

21:45.767 --> 21:47.600
you really know how
to shoot yourself in the foot.

21:47.602 --> 21:49.718
Did Beresford lie?
Did he manipulate your quote

21:49.720 --> 21:52.655
in any way that made it worse
than it already was?

21:52.657 --> 21:54.223
No.
And he didn't

21:54.225 --> 21:56.776
trick me into the interview,
and he didn't ambush me, either.

21:56.778 --> 21:59.895
He hunted down a good story,
and he did it fair and square.

21:59.897 --> 22:01.747
He took an old and
out-of-context opposition piece

22:01.749 --> 22:03.416
and used it to start a fire.

22:03.418 --> 22:05.067
In your expert opinion.

22:05.069 --> 22:07.119
Good news is, your action

22:07.121 --> 22:09.539
makes at least part of
my critique utterly ridiculous.

22:09.541 --> 22:10.227
So you say.

22:10.252 --> 22:12.290
Where I wrote that the
range of your vision

22:12.293 --> 22:14.677
is limited to the interests
of your rank and file.

22:14.679 --> 22:17.513
'Cause I don't know whose
interests are being served here,

22:17.515 --> 22:19.382
but it sure ain't
this department's.

22:19.384 --> 22:22.218
I won't waste any
more of your time.

22:24.938 --> 22:27.139
Sarge! Hey!

22:27.141 --> 22:28.924
I found Rourke's alibi.

22:28.926 --> 22:31.227
It's Peter Blake.
You bringing him in?

22:31.229 --> 22:33.229
Well, I'd have
to exhume him first.

22:33.231 --> 22:34.430
He's dead?
Yeah.

22:34.432 --> 22:36.449
Five years after
Jenny Anderson was killed.

22:36.451 --> 22:38.618
Oh. Don't tell me you think
Rourke killed him, too.

22:38.620 --> 22:39.986
No, he did himself in.

22:39.988 --> 22:42.238
He ate his gun while he
was sitting in his car.

22:42.240 --> 22:43.372
But it's connected, Sarge.
How?

22:43.374 --> 22:44.991
Well, the car
was parked in front

22:44.993 --> 22:46.042
of Jenny Anderson's
apartment,

22:46.044 --> 22:47.960
and it was on the
anniversary of her death.

22:47.962 --> 22:49.295
That's weird.
Yeah.

22:49.297 --> 22:51.080
Wasn't a nine-millimeter
that killed him, Sarge.

22:51.082 --> 22:52.498
It was guilt.

22:52.500 --> 22:53.716
Prove it.

22:53.718 --> 22:55.334
You know I will.

22:56.786 --> 22:59.805
Before they met in college,
Blake was a nothing.

22:59.807 --> 23:01.090
I mean, a nobody.

23:01.092 --> 23:03.142
He owed Rourke.
Mm-hmm.

23:03.144 --> 23:05.094
And after they graduate,
his best friend

23:05.096 --> 23:07.396
gives him an
all-access pass to the...

23:07.398 --> 23:09.432
bright lights, big city.

23:09.434 --> 23:11.817
Gives him a job at his
family's real estate empire.

23:11.819 --> 23:14.236
That's right, and now Blake's
got cash in his pocket,

23:14.238 --> 23:15.838
and more importantly,
he's got a future,

23:15.840 --> 23:17.907
and a bright one, at that.
Mm-hmm.

23:17.909 --> 23:20.409
So, when Rourke asks him
to be his alibi...

23:20.411 --> 23:22.495
he can't say no.
Right.

23:22.497 --> 23:24.664
Except Blake can't live
with the lie anymore--

23:24.666 --> 23:26.832
that he wasn't at the
movies with Rourke.

23:26.834 --> 23:28.501
Yeah. But, then, where was he?

23:28.503 --> 23:30.336
Thank you.
Well, Tuesday afternoon--

23:30.338 --> 23:32.588
he would've been at work
in the mail room, right?

23:32.590 --> 23:34.156
Yeah, but the
original detectives

23:34.158 --> 23:36.792
would have checked
the time cards.

23:37.994 --> 23:39.545
Time cards.
You know what?

23:39.547 --> 23:40.846
Rourke owned the company.

23:40.848 --> 23:43.049
I mean, if he wanted
to alter the time cards

23:43.051 --> 23:44.517
and make it
look like Blake

23:44.519 --> 23:45.851
wasn't at work,
he could have.

23:45.853 --> 23:48.187
What does a guy do in
a mail room all day?

23:48.189 --> 23:50.056
They sign for
packages, right?

23:50.058 --> 23:51.674
If we can find
Blake's signature

23:51.676 --> 23:53.976
receiving a package at
the time of the murder,

23:53.978 --> 23:56.696
it will prove he wasn't
at the movies with Rourke.

23:56.698 --> 23:58.230
Can you issue a subpoena?

23:58.232 --> 23:59.848
And let him know we're coming?

23:59.850 --> 24:03.119
No. I need to go in
as a wolf in sheep's clothing.

24:03.121 --> 24:05.204
And misrepresent yourself?

24:05.206 --> 24:06.706
It's totally legal.

24:06.708 --> 24:08.574
Yeah, but maybe that's
something I should do instead.

24:08.576 --> 24:10.859
I don't think so.

24:10.861 --> 24:12.194
Why not?

24:12.196 --> 24:14.163
I've got better legs.

24:15.666 --> 24:17.083
Right.

24:17.085 --> 24:19.368
♪

24:29.096 --> 24:31.263
I'm sorry,
but I'm not at liberty

24:31.265 --> 24:32.548
to share that information.

24:32.550 --> 24:35.050
Well, if I could just have
a moment with Mr. Rourke...

24:35.052 --> 24:36.569
I wish I could
help you.

24:36.571 --> 24:38.887
Unfortunately,
his schedule is full today.

24:38.889 --> 24:40.222
So maybe...
Uh, actually,

24:40.224 --> 24:43.409
I just freed up
some time today.

24:45.729 --> 24:47.163
Richard Rourke.

24:47.165 --> 24:48.330
Pleased to meet you.

24:48.332 --> 24:49.532
Lisa Roberts.

24:49.534 --> 24:51.450
Harten, Burns and Whitaker.

24:51.452 --> 24:53.202
A lawyer, huh?

24:53.204 --> 24:55.705
(laughs) Well, don't worry.
I don't bite.

24:55.707 --> 24:57.923
I'm sorry to hear that.
(laughs)

24:57.925 --> 25:01.093
What I meant to say is that
I'm here to help, not hurt.

25:01.095 --> 25:02.795
A benevolent lawyer.

25:02.797 --> 25:04.597
Oh, no. I am going
to hurt someone.

25:04.599 --> 25:05.748
It's just not you.

25:05.750 --> 25:07.733
So, who's the lucky fella?

25:07.735 --> 25:09.769
I'm heading
a class-action suit

25:09.771 --> 25:11.937
against your overnight
delivery service company.

25:11.939 --> 25:14.640
We have reason to believe that
they've been overcharging you

25:14.642 --> 25:17.727
and their other clients
for the last 30 years.

25:17.729 --> 25:19.895
If I'm right-- and I am--

25:19.897 --> 25:23.315
your company could be
looking at quite a windfall.

25:23.317 --> 25:25.818
All I need are
your shipping records.

25:25.820 --> 25:28.821
Huh. Well, um...

25:28.823 --> 25:32.324
all I need is
your phone number.

25:33.460 --> 25:35.444
Well...
(laughs softly)

25:35.446 --> 25:37.496
maybe we could compromise.

25:37.498 --> 25:39.465
Maybe I could get yours.

25:40.283 --> 25:42.168
Working hard,
Richard?

25:42.170 --> 25:44.453
As always, Dad.

25:44.455 --> 25:48.057
You're coming to the
Burnett meeting, right?

25:48.059 --> 25:50.810
Uh, in just a minute, yes.

25:52.128 --> 25:53.846
I'm sorry. Where were we?

25:53.848 --> 25:56.799
The shipping records
in exchange for your number.

25:56.801 --> 25:59.235
Yes, our compromise.
Of course.

25:59.237 --> 26:01.437
My cell phone is
written on the back.

26:01.439 --> 26:03.972
My secretary will give
you everything you need.

26:04.808 --> 26:07.159
I do hope to see you again.

26:07.161 --> 26:10.579
Oh, you can count on it.

26:29.280 --> 26:32.591
And here are the mail room logs
from Rourke Unlimited.

26:32.593 --> 26:35.594
It's got Blake's signature
all over it from the same day.

26:35.596 --> 26:37.730
Which blows Rourke's alibi
completely out of the water.

26:37.732 --> 26:39.231
Yep, Rourke was lying, Dad.

26:39.233 --> 26:40.766
And why would he lie
if he wasn't with Jenny?

26:40.768 --> 26:42.902
You haven't got it.

26:42.904 --> 26:44.737
What do you mean,
we haven't got it?

26:44.739 --> 26:46.822
You haven't got it.
DANNY: Well, we at least got enough

26:46.824 --> 26:49.107
to bring the guy in-- let me
sweat him out; I'll break him.

26:49.109 --> 26:51.627
And before you got one foot
in the interrogation room,

26:51.629 --> 26:52.962
his three dozen lawyers
would swoop down

26:52.964 --> 26:54.446
and have the whole
thing thrown out.

26:54.448 --> 26:55.948
You haven't got it.

26:55.950 --> 26:57.466
Unbelievable.

26:57.468 --> 26:59.451
What?
Unbelievable why?

26:59.453 --> 27:01.053
I'm sorry, Grandpa,
but I guess

27:01.055 --> 27:02.805
I just don't get
the criminal justice system.

27:02.807 --> 27:04.306
Richard Rourke lied
to the police,

27:04.308 --> 27:05.508
and that's not enough

27:05.510 --> 27:07.292
to get him arrested?
But Uncle Danny's friend

27:07.294 --> 27:09.261
is in jail for
some stupid fight

27:09.263 --> 27:10.896
he didn't even start?

27:10.898 --> 27:12.231
How is that justice?

27:12.233 --> 27:13.432
Yeah, I'm with Nicky.

27:13.434 --> 27:14.800
I mean, Rourke
is obviously

27:14.802 --> 27:16.018
hiding something,
and Bobby

27:16.020 --> 27:17.436
was just standing up
for himself.

27:17.438 --> 27:19.688
How is that fair?
And whoever said life was fair?

27:19.690 --> 27:21.824
JACK: Life <i>should</i> be far,
shouldn't it?

27:21.826 --> 27:24.076
LINDA: Yeah, it should, sweetie.
FRANK: Life isn't fair, Jack,

27:24.078 --> 27:25.110
but you can be.

27:25.112 --> 27:26.278
JAMIE: What
Grandpa means is,

27:26.280 --> 27:27.329
the criminal
justice system

27:27.331 --> 27:28.447
is complicated--
sometimes things

27:28.449 --> 27:30.315
don't work out
the way they should.

27:30.317 --> 27:32.317
And sometimes
the only thing

27:32.319 --> 27:34.370
standing in the way
of a bad guy going free

27:34.372 --> 27:35.788
or a good guy getting locked up

27:35.790 --> 27:37.706
is a cop who won't
let go of a case,

27:37.708 --> 27:39.458
or a prosecutor

27:39.460 --> 27:41.493
determined to make things right.

27:46.833 --> 27:48.884
All right,
we got to go over everything

27:48.886 --> 27:50.302
from the top, Nathan, okay?

27:50.304 --> 27:51.437
Mm-hmm.

27:51.439 --> 27:53.222
Any old newspaper articles,
photo albums,

27:53.224 --> 27:55.057
all our notes,
anything you can think of

27:55.059 --> 27:56.508
or remember.
ERIN: Right now,

27:56.510 --> 27:58.611
all we have is that Rourke
was not at the movies.

27:58.613 --> 28:00.646
It's not enough-- we need
him in the room with Jenny.

28:00.648 --> 28:03.315
DANNY: That's right, we need some type
of proof or evidence

28:03.317 --> 28:05.200
the two of them
were together on the day.

28:05.202 --> 28:08.571
This is everything
I've collected over the years

28:08.573 --> 28:10.906
that has to do with her case.

28:10.908 --> 28:13.325
All right,
let's dig in.

28:19.549 --> 28:21.250
(knocking)

28:21.252 --> 28:23.218
What's up, buddy?
How you doing?

28:23.220 --> 28:24.503
Jamie!

28:24.505 --> 28:26.505
Here, I brought you
some magazines,

28:26.507 --> 28:28.173
a little Joe's pizza.

28:28.175 --> 28:30.542
I'm sure you're sick of
the plastic chicken, right?

28:30.544 --> 28:34.063
Oh, thanks, Jamie,
but you didn't have to do that.

28:34.065 --> 28:35.180
Hey, least I could do.

28:35.182 --> 28:37.232
Besides, I wanted
to come check up on you.

28:37.234 --> 28:38.734
I left you a couple of messages,

28:38.736 --> 28:40.385
but I guess
you've been resting up.

28:40.387 --> 28:43.405
Yeah, uh, about that...

28:43.407 --> 28:47.276
yeah, I'm sorry I didn't
get back to you, but...

28:47.278 --> 28:50.496
Look, I'm not gonna be able
to drop the charges.

28:50.498 --> 28:53.582
Yeah, of course.
Your decision.

28:53.584 --> 28:56.585
So, what, they got you
in a neck brace now, too?

28:56.587 --> 28:59.505
As if the concussion
and the broken nose

28:59.507 --> 29:02.574
weren't bad enough,
now I can't move my neck.

29:02.576 --> 29:04.376
That's why I'm still here.

29:04.378 --> 29:05.878
Yeah, I thought you were
getting out yesterday,

29:05.880 --> 29:07.012
so I went by
your apartment.

29:07.014 --> 29:08.881
Really?
Yeah.

29:08.883 --> 29:11.467
Uh, yeah, we, uh...
we moved out of there.

29:11.469 --> 29:12.751
Didn't I tell you?

29:12.753 --> 29:13.769
No, you didn't.

29:13.771 --> 29:15.220
But it sounds like
you had a busy month.

29:15.222 --> 29:16.438
I called over
to your office.

29:16.440 --> 29:18.857
They said you're no
longer at the firm.

29:18.859 --> 29:21.810
Uh, I left them
to start my own practice.

29:21.812 --> 29:23.862
Wow. That's great.

29:23.864 --> 29:26.765
Guess the guy at your old
place had it wrong, then.

29:26.767 --> 29:29.434
He, uh, acted like you'd
been laid off or something.

29:29.436 --> 29:30.936
Really?

29:30.938 --> 29:33.038
That's... that's weird.

29:33.040 --> 29:34.606
Yeah.

29:36.376 --> 29:39.662
Look, Ken, we've been
friends a long time, right?

29:39.664 --> 29:41.780
If something's wrong,
you could talk to me.

29:41.782 --> 29:43.415
Maybe I can help you.

29:44.300 --> 29:46.552
Nothing's wrong, Jamie.

29:47.387 --> 29:48.804
I checked the city records.

29:48.806 --> 29:50.389
You didn't move out
of your apartment;

29:50.391 --> 29:51.757
you got foreclosed on.

29:51.759 --> 29:53.559
You been snooping around on me?

29:53.561 --> 29:55.928
Why the hell
would you be doing that?

29:55.930 --> 29:57.563
Guy I just left in the bad suit

29:57.565 --> 29:59.682
wouldn't happen to be
an ambulance chaser, would he?

30:00.650 --> 30:04.019
(sighs) Yeah, I think
you should leave, Jamie.

30:04.021 --> 30:05.938
Okay.

30:05.940 --> 30:07.356
But listen to me first.

30:07.358 --> 30:09.641
What happened on the
basketball court the other day

30:09.643 --> 30:11.994
was a stupid situation
that got out of hand.

30:11.996 --> 30:15.164
You were out of line,
and Bobby was out of line.

30:15.166 --> 30:16.815
Don't ruin his
life over this

30:16.817 --> 30:19.001
so that you can make
a couple bucks, okay?

30:19.003 --> 30:21.420
He's got a wife and kids
to take care of.

30:24.457 --> 30:26.658
Feel better, Ken.

30:30.096 --> 30:32.264
(sighs)

30:35.769 --> 30:38.670
I can still see her
playing out there.

30:39.472 --> 30:41.440
Can still hear
her little voice

30:41.442 --> 30:43.776
calling for me to come out.

30:44.778 --> 30:46.729
Nathan...

30:46.731 --> 30:50.149
You've done more than is fair
of me to ask of you.

30:50.151 --> 30:52.851
Please don't ask me to give up.

30:52.853 --> 30:54.352
I wasn't gonna say that.

30:54.354 --> 30:56.288
But it may take some time.

30:56.290 --> 30:58.290
A long time.

30:58.292 --> 31:01.543
This is all that
I have left of her.

31:01.545 --> 31:04.913
A gift I gave her
for her 16th birthday.

31:04.915 --> 31:08.250
We took that

31:08.252 --> 31:09.485
first thing that morning.

31:09.487 --> 31:11.837
She's beautiful.

31:11.839 --> 31:13.756
She was.

31:13.758 --> 31:17.309
When the police gave it back
to me, it had some blood on it.

31:18.178 --> 31:20.729
I wonder if it
was the killer's.

31:20.731 --> 31:22.881
Wishful thinking, huh?

31:22.883 --> 31:25.317
The police took
a DNA sample,

31:25.319 --> 31:27.653
but it was too small to test.

31:30.273 --> 31:31.240
Nathan,

31:31.242 --> 31:32.524
you know, DNA testing

31:32.526 --> 31:34.777
is light-years ahead
of what it was 15 years ago.

31:34.779 --> 31:35.911
Mm-hmm.

31:35.913 --> 31:37.780
I bet you we can retest
that sample.

31:37.782 --> 31:40.415
But you said
the case file's gone.

31:40.417 --> 31:41.900
There isn't any
original evidence.

31:41.902 --> 31:43.702
Yeah, yeah.

31:43.704 --> 31:45.570
The case file's gone,
but that doesn't matter.

31:45.572 --> 31:47.589
The DNA sample
should still exist.

31:47.591 --> 31:50.575
Because the DNA isn't kept
in the case file;

31:50.577 --> 31:52.678
it's stored
at the medical examiner's.

31:52.680 --> 31:54.179
Right.

31:54.181 --> 31:56.849
I'm gonna head
to the M.E.'s office.

31:56.851 --> 31:59.251
Sis, you go see Rourke, okay?

32:06.392 --> 32:08.443
Sorry I'm late.
I had to slip

32:08.445 --> 32:11.146
out of the office when
dear old Dad wasn't looking.

32:11.148 --> 32:13.232
Working late on a Sunday?
Yeah, well,

32:13.234 --> 32:15.033
first Sunday of every month,
we do the books together.

32:15.035 --> 32:17.035
Fun, fun, fun.

32:17.037 --> 32:18.403
But enough of that.

32:18.405 --> 32:19.604
Thank you

32:19.606 --> 32:21.406
for the drink.
You're welcome.

32:21.408 --> 32:24.243
I'm glad you called.
Me, too.

32:25.995 --> 32:28.580
I have a confession
to make.

32:28.582 --> 32:31.616
Mmm. This is
interesting already.

32:31.618 --> 32:33.135
Please, shoot.

32:33.137 --> 32:36.171
My name is not Lisa Roberts.

32:36.173 --> 32:39.842
Oh. Well, who are you, then?

32:39.844 --> 32:43.128
I'm an assistant
district attorney.

32:43.130 --> 32:44.730
Erin Reagan.

32:44.732 --> 32:47.850
Assistant district attorney?

32:47.852 --> 32:50.853
And you didn't tell me this
from the start because...

32:50.855 --> 32:53.155
Because I'm investigating you
for the murder

32:53.157 --> 32:55.023
of Jenny Anderson.

32:55.859 --> 32:57.860
What?

32:57.862 --> 32:59.811
True story.

33:03.649 --> 33:05.534
I didn't kill Jenny.

33:05.536 --> 33:09.288
Okay. Maybe we can go down
to my office and talk about it.

33:13.326 --> 33:16.044
Good-bye, Erin...

33:16.046 --> 33:19.631
Lisa or whatever your name is.

33:19.633 --> 33:21.800
(sighs)

33:44.240 --> 33:47.192
To be honest with you, Danny,
it's kind of fun playing cop.

33:47.194 --> 33:50.045
Oh, yeah, it's a real blast till
people start shooting at you.

33:50.047 --> 33:52.046
Reagan, rush on your DNA
results are in.

33:52.071 --> 33:53.221
Mmm.

33:54.417 --> 33:55.968
What?

33:55.970 --> 33:57.386
It's not him.

33:57.388 --> 33:59.004
It's not Richard Rourke.

33:59.006 --> 34:01.723
Then who?
The lab rats say it was close

34:01.725 --> 34:05.260
to a 100% match,
but not quite, which means...

34:05.262 --> 34:07.145
Which means it's a relative.

34:09.514 --> 34:11.266
Rourke's father.

34:30.667 --> 34:32.885
DANNY:
Richard Rourke!

34:34.338 --> 34:36.705
Richard Rourke, police!

34:36.706 --> 34:39.759
You sure he's working?
Yeah, he said they were working late.

34:39.761 --> 34:42.061
(voices arguing in distance)
You got your piece on?

34:42.063 --> 34:44.429
Yeah, I always bring a gun
to family dinner.

34:44.431 --> 34:47.099
I got no backup.
Hold this.

34:47.101 --> 34:50.319
Call 911. Get some backup.

34:52.554 --> 34:55.274
PRESTON: You're not going
to do any such thing.

34:55.275 --> 34:56.409
Now, you listen to me.

34:56.411 --> 34:57.910
RICHARD: No, you
listen to me, Dad.

34:57.912 --> 34:59.912
PRESTON: What the...? What do you think
you're doing?!

34:59.914 --> 35:01.364
RICHARD:
I can't do this anymore!

35:01.366 --> 35:03.132
You have to go to them...
Richard.

35:03.134 --> 35:04.417
Drop the gun!

35:04.419 --> 35:05.951
You come any
closer, I shoot.

35:05.953 --> 35:07.670
You're not gonna shoot anyone.
You're gonna drop

35:07.672 --> 35:09.755
that gun now.
I didn't kill Jenny.

35:09.757 --> 35:12.341
I know you didn't.
I know it was him.

35:12.343 --> 35:14.627
Okay? And I know
you want payback,

35:14.629 --> 35:16.295
but not this way.

35:17.080 --> 35:18.798
Yes, this way.
PRESTON: Richard,

35:18.800 --> 35:21.801
think about what you're doing.
This is ludicrous!

35:21.803 --> 35:25.137
For the first time in 15 years,
I know exactly what I'm doing.

35:25.139 --> 35:26.772
Richard, put the gun down.

35:26.774 --> 35:28.774
Not until he confesses.

35:28.776 --> 35:31.844
I swear to you, he tells
the truth, I drop the gun.

35:31.846 --> 35:34.063
I promise.

35:35.482 --> 35:36.932
Go ahead. Tell them.

35:36.934 --> 35:39.001
Tell them why you
killed Jenny.

35:40.770 --> 35:42.988
Because you thought she wasn't
good enough for me, right?

35:42.990 --> 35:44.824
That's not true.
Because she didn't...

35:44.826 --> 35:47.109
live up to the Rourke name.

35:47.111 --> 35:48.794
Because she was black.

35:48.796 --> 35:51.330
(sighs)
I...

35:51.332 --> 35:52.998
I don't know
what he's talking about.

35:53.000 --> 35:55.751
Clearly...
he's gone insane.

35:55.753 --> 35:57.219
Richard, you're just
gonna make this worse.

35:57.221 --> 35:58.888
Put the gun down
and we can talk.

35:58.890 --> 36:02.124
I left work early that day
to be with her.

36:03.810 --> 36:06.312
When you found out
where I'd gone,

36:06.314 --> 36:09.231
you came to her apartment to try
to make me end things with her.

36:09.233 --> 36:10.349
Do you remember that?

36:10.351 --> 36:12.634
Things got heated,
and we started fighting.

36:12.636 --> 36:16.689
When Jenny tried to break
things up, do you remember?

36:16.691 --> 36:18.274
You hit her.

36:18.276 --> 36:21.060
You knocked her head
against the wall.

36:22.779 --> 36:24.613
And she...

36:24.615 --> 36:27.149
she never got up, Dad.

36:27.151 --> 36:29.835
She never... she never woke up.

36:29.837 --> 36:31.387
Richard, drop the gun.

36:31.389 --> 36:33.655
These are a lot of lies.

36:33.657 --> 36:35.824
He's telling you lies!

36:35.826 --> 36:37.493
Hell they are.

36:37.495 --> 36:39.295
Drop it!
(gun clicks)

36:39.297 --> 36:40.713
(grunts)

36:40.715 --> 36:42.181
Don't move!

36:42.183 --> 36:44.833
(Richard grunts, coughs)

36:44.835 --> 36:46.469
(Richard grunting)

36:54.027 --> 36:56.979
(typing)

37:07.407 --> 37:08.958
(door opens)

37:19.369 --> 37:22.755
FYI, the blinds work fine,
but the soundproofing sucks.

37:22.757 --> 37:24.507
Am I raising my voice?

37:24.509 --> 37:25.891
Not yet.

37:28.878 --> 37:30.879
(sighs)

37:30.881 --> 37:33.048
Where does someone sit?

37:38.989 --> 37:41.223
Please.
Thank you.

37:50.867 --> 37:53.452
(sighs) Did you read
what I sent over?

37:53.454 --> 37:55.454
Yes, I did.
And?

37:56.373 --> 37:58.240
It's pretty accurate, I guess.

37:58.242 --> 38:02.294
The part about me not being
a leader of men kind of stung.

38:02.296 --> 38:03.912
Who wrote it?

38:03.914 --> 38:06.215
I did.

38:09.052 --> 38:12.304
I record my private notes
when I'm going through

38:12.306 --> 38:15.391
the interview process
for senior positions.

38:18.395 --> 38:21.430
"Not a leader of men"
sounds like bad Hemingway.

38:21.432 --> 38:24.433
Well, I'm not
the writer you are.

38:25.318 --> 38:27.987
And I'm not the leader
of men you are.

38:27.989 --> 38:29.989
Says so...

38:29.991 --> 38:32.207
right here.

38:35.495 --> 38:37.663
(sighs)

38:40.884 --> 38:43.919
A lot of what you wrote
about me...

38:43.921 --> 38:46.805
was hard to hear...

38:46.807 --> 38:49.975
but... accurate.

38:51.611 --> 38:53.896
Some of what I
wrote about you

38:53.898 --> 38:55.797
is hard to hear...

38:55.799 --> 38:58.484
but accurate.

39:00.637 --> 39:02.655
I was captain
of my college rowing team.

39:02.657 --> 39:04.023
Did you know that?

39:04.025 --> 39:05.608
16 men under my command.

39:05.610 --> 39:07.409
The point is we're a good team.

39:08.811 --> 39:12.665
And a better one when we keep
the other guy honest.

39:12.667 --> 39:16.585
(sighs)
Even when it stings.

39:17.454 --> 39:19.622
Well, I don't know about you,

39:19.624 --> 39:22.841
but I've had enough honesty
for one week.

39:25.362 --> 39:27.513
(sighs)

39:29.466 --> 39:31.450
Does the captain
of the rowing team

39:31.452 --> 39:34.002
get to sit up front
and beat a drum?

39:34.004 --> 39:37.022
And dispenses
rum rations.

39:38.391 --> 39:40.609
Impressive.

39:41.811 --> 39:44.613
We've got the mayor and
the parks commissioner at 4:00.

39:44.615 --> 39:47.182
(sighs)

39:47.184 --> 39:49.785
See you upstairs.

39:52.288 --> 39:54.490
(door opens)

39:55.542 --> 39:57.242
(door shuts)

40:05.201 --> 40:06.835
I don't know what
to say, Danny.

40:06.837 --> 40:08.454
Don't have to say
anything to me.

40:08.456 --> 40:09.705
Thank Jamie.

40:09.707 --> 40:11.223
Jamie, thank you.

40:11.225 --> 40:14.093
Hey. I'm just sorry you had
to go through all this.

40:14.095 --> 40:16.095
Thank you, Jamie.

40:16.097 --> 40:17.429
I'll see you around, Gina.

40:17.431 --> 40:18.564
Thank you, Danny.
Thanks.

40:18.566 --> 40:20.766
BOBBY: Come on.
Let's go home.

40:22.519 --> 40:25.020
Good job,
baby brother.

40:25.022 --> 40:27.222
Thanks, Danny.

40:33.697 --> 40:36.281
ERIN:
I want to show you something.

40:36.283 --> 40:37.899
What are we doing
back here?

40:37.901 --> 40:40.869
The auction item you won
promised you a front-row seat

40:40.871 --> 40:42.671
to the criminal
justice system, right?

40:42.673 --> 40:43.905
Mm-hmm.

40:43.907 --> 40:45.624
So watch this.

40:45.626 --> 40:47.409
MAN:
Why did you kill her?

40:47.411 --> 40:48.711
(reporters clamoring)

40:48.713 --> 40:50.963
No comment. No comment.

40:50.965 --> 40:53.549
PRESTON:
No comment.

40:56.770 --> 41:00.139
You ready to go put
some bad guys away?

41:00.141 --> 41:03.475
I have waited 15 years
for this day.

41:03.477 --> 41:06.094
I'm more than ready.

41:06.096 --> 41:08.897
And, Erin... thank you.

41:10.082 --> 41:12.082
Thank you, Nathan.

41:12.084 --> 41:17.084
