WEBVTT

01:51.195 --> 01:53.277
Three more gone this morning.

01:55.116 --> 01:57.528
Outcasts and idiots.

01:57.660 --> 02:00.197
They all get restless. With the fighting done,

02:00.329 --> 02:05.699
they want to be home with money in their
pockets, not sitting in this dismal cold and wet.

02:05.835 --> 02:09.327
None of the good men have run. Nor will they.

02:09.463 --> 02:11.454
Nor will they follow you to Rome.

02:11.590 --> 02:13.376
Not yet.

02:13.509 --> 02:15.374
Time is running out.

02:16.512 --> 02:18.719
We cannot wait here forever.

02:18.848 --> 02:21.430
This is a very precarious position.

02:21.559 --> 02:27.600
What happens in January when your term
runs out and we're still sitting here?

02:31.610 --> 02:34.818
The business of motivating men to fight
is a tricky matter.

02:34.947 --> 02:38.735
I would not expect a slave
to understand the subtleties.

02:38.868 --> 02:42.861
I trust an education in these subtleties
will begin shortly.

02:47.043 --> 02:48.749
500,000? What's this?

02:48.878 --> 02:54.669
I put Mark Antony up for election as People's
Tribune. A lot of votes needed buying.

02:54.800 --> 02:58.668
Mark Antony for People's Tribune? But he is...

03:00.681 --> 03:02.012
You may speak.

03:02.141 --> 03:04.848
I had understood the Tribune
to be a sacred office

03:04.977 --> 03:07.138
with the power of veto over the Senate.

03:07.271 --> 03:10.980
— So it is.
— An office of great dignity and seriousness.

03:11.817 --> 03:14.229
Perhaps you're right.

03:14.362 --> 03:18.901
We shall send Strabo along
to make sure Antony behaves himself.

03:32.254 --> 03:35.621
- How far now?
— Three hours at pace.

03:37.093 --> 03:38.629
Here I come, girls.

03:38.761 --> 03:42.299
I'm going to drink wine,
smoke and fuck every whore in the city.

03:42.431 --> 03:46.299
— Show dignity. You're under the standard.
- Well, talk to him.

03:48.104 --> 03:49.969
He's not under the standard.

03:51.565 --> 03:54.898
Three hours from a wife he hasn't seen
in years. He's terrified.

03:55.027 --> 03:56.983
Surely a reunion is a happy event.

03:57.113 --> 04:00.196
- Talk of something else.
— What if she's lost her teeth?

04:00.324 --> 04:03.816
What if she's got skinny or been letting
other men between her legs?

04:03.953 --> 04:05.614
Silence!

04:29.812 --> 04:34.476
We're all with you, Mark Antony!
Hail, Mark Antony, our protector!

04:38.279 --> 04:39.860
Hail, Mark Antony!

04:39.989 --> 04:45.029
— They love him?
— No matter. We are all men of substance.

04:45.161 --> 04:48.198
Let them have the love of the plebs
and the proles.

04:58.007 --> 04:59.713
This won't take long, will it?

04:59.842 --> 05:01.833
We can hope, Dominus.

05:01.969 --> 05:04.881
— Vorenus, you may dismiss the men.
— Sir.

05:05.014 --> 05:07.881
And then you may dismiss yourself
until I send for you.

05:08.017 --> 05:12.886
Have some fun.
But first, take the boy back to Atia.

05:13.022 --> 05:14.978
Get your reward, eh?

05:15.107 --> 05:18.395
Boy, tell your lovely mother
I will see her later.

05:20.404 --> 05:22.486
Let's get this over with.

05:38.756 --> 05:40.496
You, leave this house this moment.

05:40.633 --> 05:42.624
I will not. Octavia is my rightful wife.

05:42.760 --> 05:45.297
— You defy Caesar?
— A fig for Caesar!

05:45.429 --> 05:47.385
If I were not a genteel woman,

05:47.515 --> 05:50.973
I would have you flayed
and hung from a bracket at the door!

05:51.101 --> 05:52.511
— Castor?
— Domina?

05:52.645 --> 05:54.727
Fetch the dogs!

05:58.442 --> 06:03.357
lnsolentwretch! ltell you, my honey,
you are well rid of that one.

06:03.489 --> 06:06.447
I hate you. I hate you!

06:07.743 --> 06:09.574
Silly girl.

06:21.257 --> 06:23.999
I'm only doing my best for her.
Why can't she see that?

06:24.134 --> 06:26.125
— She is young.
— Master Octavian!

06:26.262 --> 06:27.798
Baby boy!

06:27.930 --> 06:30.262
My poor rabbit!

06:33.769 --> 06:38.263
So thin. Was it very horrible? Of course it was.

06:38.399 --> 06:40.765
I can't even imagine. We shan't talk about it.

06:40.901 --> 06:45.440
We should just put it totally out of our minds.
You're back safe at home now.

06:48.617 --> 06:50.573
But who are those?

06:50.703 --> 06:54.912
You are to be very good to them, Mother.
They are particular friends of mine.

06:55.040 --> 06:57.417
Friends? In what particular?

06:57.543 --> 07:00.000
These are the men that took me from captivity.

07:00.129 --> 07:02.791
First Spear Centurion Lucius Vorenus.

07:04.258 --> 07:06.419
And Legionary Titus Pullo.

07:07.011 --> 07:09.673
So, we embrace you.

07:09.805 --> 07:11.716
Good fearsome specimens you are.

07:11.849 --> 07:14.841
I wonder it took you so long
to subdue those odious Gauls.

07:14.977 --> 07:16.888
There was a great many of them, ma'am.

07:17.021 --> 07:20.684
— Great many... Very good.
- We'll be away then, sir.

07:20.816 --> 07:23.933
But you must be rewarded before you go.
Bring me my purse.

07:24.069 --> 07:26.731
— That won't be necessary.
- Will it not?

07:26.864 --> 07:30.322
— They shall stay and eat.
— There's bread and meat in the kitchen.

07:30.451 --> 07:32.191
I mean, they shall eat with us.

07:32.328 --> 07:35.195
Obliged, sir, but I must go to my wife.

07:35.331 --> 07:38.664
Your wife has waited eight years.
She can wait a little longer.

07:38.792 --> 07:42.535
Caesar has given them honorary horses
and they ride with the standard.

07:42.671 --> 07:45.333
It's perfectly acceptable to eat with them.

07:45.466 --> 07:47.422
Splendid idea.

07:47.551 --> 07:51.840
It's symbolic.
We shall all dine together as equals.

07:56.518 --> 07:58.725
- What's that?
— It's just your sister.

07:58.854 --> 08:01.095
- Is she all right?
— Women's troubles.

08:01.231 --> 08:03.187
Nothing a good leeching won't cure.

08:12.117 --> 08:16.406
Jupiter Fulgor, we ask you
to guide and protect this man,

08:16.538 --> 08:20.247
Marcus Antonius,
newly elected Tribune of plebs,

08:20.376 --> 08:22.287
champion of the people.

08:23.212 --> 08:25.168
How many dead altogether?

08:25.297 --> 08:28.915
I don't know. I lost count ages ago.

08:29.051 --> 08:32.043
- Lots, though.
— And you, Lucius?

08:32.179 --> 08:33.544
309 fighting men.

08:33.681 --> 08:36.423
— I don't keep count on civilians.
— You're very exact.

08:36.558 --> 08:39.686
The war temple requires an exact number
when you make an offering.

08:39.812 --> 08:42.394
That's a lot of wine and goats.

08:42.523 --> 08:46.186
The priests offer a discount
when you pass 100.

08:46.318 --> 08:48.354
Priests! Crooks, many of them.

08:48.487 --> 08:53.151
| just talk direct to whatever God I'm
doing business with. Bugger the priests!

08:53.283 --> 08:57.617
Too few people can be bothered to do things
the proper, all—Roman way.

08:57.746 --> 09:00.613
— I commend you, Lucius.
— Vorenus is a strict Catonian.

09:00.749 --> 09:02.785
I believe in the divinity of the Republic.

09:02.918 --> 09:06.410
If Cato believes the same,
then I suppose I am a Catonian.

09:06.547 --> 09:08.959
But Cato represents the rights of the nobility.

09:09.091 --> 09:13.175
Surely a plebeian like yourself
would like to see some changes made.

09:13.303 --> 09:17.216
It should remain as it was at the founding
of the Republic. Why should that change?

09:17.349 --> 09:21.308
Because the Roman people are suffering.
Slaves have taken all the work.

09:21.437 --> 09:23.348
Nobles have taken all the land

09:23.480 --> 09:26.096
and the streets are full of the homeless
and the starving.

09:26.233 --> 09:28.815
I had no idea my son was such a firebrand.

09:28.944 --> 09:30.480
The nobles say Caesar is a war criminal

09:33.198 --> 09:35.985
That is sacrilege.
No man of honour would follow him.

09:36.118 --> 09:39.736
Well, I'm no man of honour, then.
I say that Caesar should ride in here

09:39.872 --> 09:43.706
with elephants and squash Pompey
and Cato and anybody else that wants it.

09:43.834 --> 09:45.620
Never mind the law. That's what I say.

09:45.753 --> 09:49.462
Because you govern your reason
no better than you govern your tongue.

09:49.590 --> 09:52.798
Forgive me, it's my fault
for mixing politics and wine.

09:52.926 --> 09:54.587
More tench?

09:54.720 --> 09:57.132
— A dormouse perhaps?
- Thank you, I won't.

09:57.264 --> 10:01.849
Don't mind my saying it
but you two make unlikely friends.

10:01.977 --> 10:04.343
We are not friends.
I am his superior officer.

10:04.480 --> 10:08.644
— By virtue of rank, if nothing else.
— That is enough from you!

10:10.861 --> 10:14.274
Please forgive our vulgar ways.
We are not fit for your presence.

10:14.406 --> 10:18.649
Not at all. I've enjoyed your company
immensely. It's been most refreshing.

10:18.786 --> 10:22.529
With your permission, we shall...leave you.

10:25.000 --> 10:28.868
Do come and visit us again.
Octavian needs reliable friends.

10:29.004 --> 10:32.337
— He may depend on you, I trust.
— As you say, madam.

10:41.934 --> 10:45.051
— Say again?
— I did not speak.

10:45.187 --> 10:49.726
| go this way. My home is behind
the street of the cloth dyers...

10:49.858 --> 10:51.598
Go with fortune, sir.

10:54.655 --> 10:58.989
The cleaner brothels are in the Subura,
next to the Venereal Temple.

11:31.900 --> 11:33.561
Niobe.

11:45.247 --> 11:47.363
You're alive.

11:49.877 --> 11:52.368
What child is that?

11:52.504 --> 11:54.119
Answer me.

11:54.256 --> 11:56.713
What child is that?

11:59.303 --> 12:02.921
- He's your grandson.
— Speak sense, whore.

12:03.473 --> 12:05.384
Wait, now.

12:05.517 --> 12:07.803
Your grandson, the son of your daughter.

12:07.936 --> 12:11.019
— My daughter is only...
- She's 13, near 14.

12:11.148 --> 12:14.106
- A son by who?
— Crito, a drover's boy.

12:15.694 --> 12:18.561
His name is Lucius.

12:19.072 --> 12:20.778
Niobe, stop.

12:20.908 --> 12:23.570
| order you to stop!

12:28.123 --> 12:30.284
Your father's home.

12:38.884 --> 12:41.170
Girls, this is your father.

12:45.474 --> 12:48.511
Daughters, I'm pleased
to find you healthy and good—looking.

12:48.644 --> 12:52.307
A benefice you favour your mother
now you see how ugly your father is.

12:53.315 --> 12:55.055
Come.

12:57.444 --> 13:00.060
She's not simple, is she?

13:00.197 --> 13:03.530
Greet your father properly
as you've been taught to do.

13:45.534 --> 13:48.241
Your pay stopped coming a year ago.

13:48.370 --> 13:52.329
The paymaster said you must be dead.
They said they don't make mistakes.

13:53.750 --> 13:56.036
Damned fools. I'll have it seen to.

13:58.255 --> 14:00.086
A bit of a surprise to see me, then?

14:01.758 --> 14:04.500
A bit surprised to be called whore.

14:05.971 --> 14:08.713
That was...wrong.

14:09.766 --> 14:11.347
I am sorry for it.

14:11.476 --> 14:14.764
— A whore in front of everybody.
- I said sorry.

14:31.872 --> 14:35.035
— Is it as you like it?
— Less salt next time.

14:38.920 --> 14:41.753
So, how did you manage for money?

14:42.758 --> 14:45.750
My sister Lyde
and her husband helped us out.

14:46.928 --> 14:49.385
Well, you won't need their help any more.

14:52.142 --> 14:55.350
The big phallus
is of a Suevi I killed in the Rhinelands,

14:55.479 --> 14:58.596
a very strong and fierce people.

14:59.691 --> 15:01.352
Nice.

15:03.111 --> 15:07.901
My official spoils I've put into slaves.
They're at the market.

15:08.033 --> 15:10.274
I should clear 10,000 denarii.

15:11.578 --> 15:14.035
That's good news.

15:24.174 --> 15:26.256
Come with me, sir.

15:58.875 --> 16:06.122
By grace of Roma, for 12 moons hence,
thou art Tribune of plebs.

16:07.843 --> 16:09.708
About time.

16:09.845 --> 16:12.427
— I need a drink.
- Indeed, sir.

16:12.556 --> 16:14.512
Perhaps after the meeting.

16:15.142 --> 16:19.806
- Cicero.
— My dear Atia, a pleasure.

16:19.938 --> 16:22.805
Forgive us for imposing
at such a ludicrous hour.

16:22.941 --> 16:27.435
Not at all, I adore it. The secrecy,
the intrigue, it's most thrilling.

16:27.571 --> 16:31.063
Comprehend, woman, this meeting is invisible.

16:31.199 --> 16:34.032
Be assured, Cato, I do not see you.

16:38.665 --> 16:43.659
— General Antony, we are...
— Oh, gods, your beauty is painful.

16:43.795 --> 16:46.537
You are the crucifix of Venus.

16:48.466 --> 16:50.843
Let me die in your arms.

16:50.969 --> 16:52.925
Desist, Antony.

16:53.054 --> 16:55.716
— Good evening to you all.
- General Antony.

16:55.849 --> 16:58.181
Tribune Antony, if you please.

16:58.310 --> 17:01.177
You're inside the sacred precincts of Rome

17:01.313 --> 17:04.055
but yet you wear
the bloody red cloak of a soldier.

17:06.234 --> 17:08.190
lt completely fell from my mind.

17:08.320 --> 17:12.609
I'm most extremely sorry.
Will you forgive me, friend Cato?

17:14.201 --> 17:16.783
Atia, please, will you take this and burn it?

17:16.912 --> 17:20.200
— That's not necessary.
— Is it not?

17:22.083 --> 17:24.460
Then let's stop this blathering
and get down to business.

17:24.586 --> 17:26.417
Blathering you say?

17:26.546 --> 17:29.754
What a congery of heroes. Such vim!

17:29.883 --> 17:31.874
| feel like Helen of Troy.

17:32.010 --> 17:34.171
Would you adjourn to the courtyard?

17:34.304 --> 17:37.091
Speak, young Marcus.
What have you to tell us?

17:37.224 --> 17:40.808
l have been delegated by Caesar
to negotiate a compromise.

17:40.936 --> 17:42.722
Caesar wishes to avoid bloodshed.

17:42.854 --> 17:46.267
He wishes to be seen
as a man of reason and probity.

17:46.399 --> 17:48.981
When his term as governor of Gaul has ended,

17:49.110 --> 17:53.103
he is willing to accept command
of a single legion province.

17:55.575 --> 17:59.193
— I don't understand.
— Command of a province.

17:59.329 --> 18:01.285
So he will have legal immunity.

18:01.414 --> 18:05.623
So that none of you rascals
can go dragging him through the courts.

18:05.752 --> 18:10.746
We're here to discuss the terms
of Caesar's resignation.

18:11.925 --> 18:16.464
He could have avoided prosecution
by accepting a few years' banishment.

18:16.596 --> 18:18.336
Banishment for what?

18:18.473 --> 18:20.088
For fomenting a tyranny.

18:20.225 --> 18:24.468
lllegal warfare, theft, murder, treason!

18:24.604 --> 18:28.847
And what shall be your punishment,
Pompey, for betraying a friend,

18:28.984 --> 18:33.398
for deserting the cause of your people,
for allying yourself with so—called noblemen.

18:33.530 --> 18:36.647
— What punishment for you?
— lmpudent whelp!

18:37.492 --> 18:40.734
The man's term of office ends in two weeks.

18:40.870 --> 18:43.703
— We say six months.
— Two weeks!

18:43.832 --> 18:48.701
He sits alone in Ravenna
with one mutinous skeleton of a legion

18:48.837 --> 18:51.374
and he dares to dictate terms to me?

18:51.506 --> 18:54.088
Caesar has many more legions than the 13th.

18:54.217 --> 18:56.208
On the far side of the Alps.

18:56.344 --> 18:58.380
Winter does not last for ever.

18:58.513 --> 19:01.220
Spring comes, snows melt.

19:01.349 --> 19:03.726
- That's a threat!
— I assure you it is no threat.

19:03.852 --> 19:09.063
- Snows always melt.
— If he does not get a province?

19:09.190 --> 19:15.937
Caesar will take all measures required
to protect both his interests

19:16.072 --> 19:17.687
and those of the Republic.

19:17.824 --> 19:19.985
I am grieved and surprised.

19:20.118 --> 19:24.111
I'd hoped we would have a rational negotiation.

19:24.247 --> 19:26.704
If that is his last word, we shall go.

19:31.254 --> 19:33.290
Then we have no more business.

19:33.423 --> 19:37.291
Caesar is bluffing.
He wishes to appear supremely confident.

19:37.427 --> 19:40.510
Evidently he is desperately
weaker than we'd thought.

19:40.638 --> 19:44.096
It is a last-ditch attempt
to frighten us into making concessions,

19:44.225 --> 19:46.432
while he still has the semblance of an army.

19:46.561 --> 19:48.472
He's weak, Cicero. Dying.

19:48.605 --> 19:52.097
Is that not when all the proverbs
tell us to be wary?

19:52.233 --> 19:55.976
Does not the dying serpent bite deepest?

20:14.923 --> 20:17.130
- Let's play.
— Where are you from, friend?

20:17.258 --> 20:20.546
- 13th.
— Better keep that quiet.

20:20.678 --> 20:23.260
This is deep Pompeian territory.

20:23.390 --> 20:25.346
So, we're all Romans, eh?

20:35.402 --> 20:37.233
Come on, ladies, hear me now.

20:37.362 --> 20:40.104
Furies and river gods for five.

21:27.370 --> 21:31.864
You will be pleased to hear that
General Antony was as blithely arrogant

21:32.000 --> 21:34.833
and provocative as one could hope for.

21:37.046 --> 21:42.086
And Pompey and Cato were deeply offended
by your negotiating position.

21:43.553 --> 21:45.839
Wise Men and Graces on four!

21:48.099 --> 21:49.839
Those Graces don't like you.

21:49.976 --> 21:53.639
— They piss on your face.
— They piss on my face?

21:53.771 --> 21:57.309
— They piss on my face?
- Calm, brother.

21:57.442 --> 21:59.728
The man has an ill way with him.

21:59.861 --> 22:03.570
He's lost a lot of money.
He means no offence.

22:03.698 --> 22:05.529
- Do you?
— None at all.

22:08.703 --> 22:10.534
Twin river gods over two.

22:22.050 --> 22:24.587
Graces...over four.

22:28.723 --> 22:31.965
How do you feel now, soldier? Feel good?

23:48.928 --> 23:51.465
— Who is this man?
— Run and get a doctor!

23:51.598 --> 23:55.466
— I don't want people dying in my house!
— Do as I say, woman!

25:17.725 --> 25:22.344
There will be copious pus,
first putrid, then wholesome,

25:22.480 --> 25:24.846
and mayhap fits of the spleen,

25:24.982 --> 25:27.359
but that will be all to the good.

25:27.485 --> 25:30.852
A purging of the malignancy will follow.

25:30.988 --> 25:33.070
This is brass.

25:35.410 --> 25:37.241
Come.

25:37.370 --> 25:38.985
When will he wake up?

25:39.122 --> 25:42.114
Today, tomorrow, maybe never.

25:45.044 --> 25:47.956
You might try an offering to Spes.

25:48.089 --> 25:50.705
A white rabbit often works.

25:50.842 --> 25:53.879
I'll send my boy tomorrow
to check the dressings.

25:57.432 --> 26:01.016
— What misery!
— It's only blood. lt'll wash.

26:02.437 --> 26:05.645
— Where are you going?
— l have business.

26:05.773 --> 26:07.855
Business? What business?

26:09.235 --> 26:14.025
I understand that you are upset but I will
ask you do not question me in that tone.

26:18.828 --> 26:20.659
Tone...

26:20.788 --> 26:22.369
My father's cock!

26:22.498 --> 26:24.580
How's that for tone?

26:28.838 --> 26:31.796
55, 55. 60.

26:31.924 --> 26:33.835
60, 60...so|d!

26:45.021 --> 26:49.264
This is bona stock
but it's all skin and bone, eh?

26:49.400 --> 26:51.140
You want a good price.

26:51.277 --> 26:54.144
Let us feed them up,
put some fat on them.

26:54.280 --> 26:58.364
Couple weeks of easy living
and these puppies will sell like duck hearts.

26:58.493 --> 27:00.484
Is that expensive, fodder and storage?

27:00.620 --> 27:03.828
No! You'll recoup feed and storage double.

27:10.505 --> 27:13.212
Beautiful! A real showman.

27:13.341 --> 27:16.174
I am no judge of the sand,

27:16.302 --> 27:22.923
but sure, anyone can see
he is rare large and aggressive.

27:26.187 --> 27:28.223
When the Senate meets tomorrow,

27:28.356 --> 27:32.224
Scipio will propose
an ultimatum be put to Caesar.

27:32.360 --> 27:35.648
| ask you as a friend to support the proposal

27:35.780 --> 27:39.113
and to enjoin your many friends
to do the same.

27:39.242 --> 27:41.403
l have not so many friends as all that.

27:41.536 --> 27:43.902
The moderates follow you like sheep.

27:44.038 --> 27:46.575
— Your vote is critical.
— The ultimatum is?

27:46.707 --> 27:48.914
Caesar's term of office is over.

27:49.043 --> 27:51.204
He must immediately disband his men,

27:51.337 --> 27:53.919
resign his command and return for trial,

27:54.048 --> 27:57.961
else be considered an enemy
of the Senate and people of Rome.

27:58.094 --> 28:01.757
But he cannot accept that.
Not without dishonour.

28:01.889 --> 28:05.632
Once declared hostile, he has nothing to lose.
He will fight at any cost.

28:05.768 --> 28:07.429
You are declaring war!

28:07.562 --> 28:11.054
Caesar won't have
to accept or refuse the terms,

28:11.190 --> 28:15.024
because Mark Antony
will immediately use Tribune's veto.

28:15.152 --> 28:16.688
But then what is your purpose?

28:16.821 --> 28:21.064
If the Senate votes against him,
Caesar will finally understand

28:21.200 --> 28:23.782
that he is alone, against all.

28:23.911 --> 28:26.288
Of course, anything but an ovenNhelming vote

28:26.414 --> 28:30.578
encourages Caesar to think
he still has friends and hope.

28:35.840 --> 28:40.254
I am no friend to Caesar, nor any tyrant,
but I cannot vote for a proposal

28:40.386 --> 28:44.004
I do not wish to see realised.
It would be highly irreligious.

28:44.140 --> 28:45.926
l have made a vow to Jupiter.

28:46.058 --> 28:49.141
Unless I get the full backing
of the Senate tomorrow,

28:49.270 --> 28:52.182
l and all my legions will sail for Spain

28:52.315 --> 28:55.523
and leave you gentlemen
to your own defences.

29:06.203 --> 29:08.364
This is he? Crito?

29:08.497 --> 29:10.624
He's a good boy from a good family.

29:10.750 --> 29:15.164
Good enough to seed a child of the Vorenii
who fought at Magnesia and Zama?

29:15.296 --> 29:18.003
— I don't rightly know.
— You don't rightly know!

29:18.132 --> 29:20.248
Do you know that this girl is my property?

29:20.384 --> 29:23.672
You should have asked my permission
before you coupled with her!

29:23.804 --> 29:25.886
— I'm sorry, sir.
— I am within my rights

29:26.015 --> 29:27.676
to kill you here and now.

29:27.808 --> 29:29.935
- Please.
— Don't you start sniffling.

29:30.061 --> 29:32.552
You should think before you spread your legs.

29:32.688 --> 29:35.930
They meant you no disrespect.
What they did was only natural.

29:36.067 --> 29:39.275
— They're young and they love each other.
- That's no excuse.

29:39.403 --> 29:42.520
His mother's family are well—found
in Ostia for generations

29:42.657 --> 29:45.194
and his father is a successful drover.

29:45.326 --> 29:47.442
They have a house in the southern crossroads.

29:47.578 --> 29:49.955
A house built from cattle dung, no doubt.

29:50.790 --> 29:52.701
It's very hygienic, sir. There's no smell.

29:55.836 --> 29:58.293
There's money in droving, at least.

29:58.422 --> 30:01.789
Good money, sir. I'm on the Capua run mostly.

30:01.926 --> 30:04.668
That's 5,000 head a week sometimes, sir.

30:06.305 --> 30:08.887
He cannot be but what he is.
When are you a man?

30:09.016 --> 30:11.849
— Next month, sir.
- Next month.

30:15.523 --> 30:17.855
Very well, you may marry my daughter.

30:17.984 --> 30:21.693
Assure your good people that
the dowry will be appropriate.

30:31.497 --> 30:33.488
He really is a good boy.

30:33.624 --> 30:36.206
You should be pleased.

30:36.335 --> 30:40.078
My daughter's virginity has been taken

30:40.214 --> 30:43.547
and my first grandson
spawned by an ill—favoured prole.

30:43.676 --> 30:45.792
How can I be pleased?

30:45.928 --> 30:47.589
— He makes her happy.
- She's an idiot.

30:47.722 --> 30:49.804
What a brute you are!

31:26.177 --> 31:31.012
The Senate will hear Metellus Scipio.

31:31.140 --> 31:33.347
Speak! Speak!

31:33.476 --> 31:38.470
Conscript fathers, I propose a formal motion.

31:38.606 --> 31:44.818
Unless Gaius Julius Caesar
immediately lays down his command,

31:44.945 --> 31:48.904
disbands his legions
and returns to Rome for trial,

31:49.033 --> 31:53.367
this sacred assembly
will declare him a public enemy

31:53.496 --> 31:56.238
of the Senate and people of Rome!

31:56.373 --> 32:00.161
After which time it will be the duty

32:00.294 --> 32:04.162
and the obligation of every Roman
to do him harm

32:04.298 --> 32:06.630
or to kill him if they are able!

32:16.393 --> 32:19.180
A motion is proposed.

32:19.313 --> 32:22.396
Those in favour, make it known.

32:55.391 --> 33:00.010
The motion is carried by clear numbers.

33:04.525 --> 33:06.732
Veto the motion!

33:06.861 --> 33:10.228
Stand up! Veto the motion!

33:11.866 --> 33:16.075
I demand the floor! I demand the floor!

33:16.203 --> 33:18.410
— Give him the floor!
- l veto the motion!

33:18.539 --> 33:20.871
Tribune vetoes the motion!

33:24.920 --> 33:28.788
Scipio's motion against Caesar,
it doesn't stand, does it?

33:28.924 --> 33:33.133
Stands. Entered in the annals.

33:33.262 --> 33:37.346
Despite that Tribune raised his veto?

33:38.017 --> 33:42.306
Not heard, not fully admitted.

33:42.438 --> 33:45.646
No weight. The motion stands.

33:46.901 --> 33:49.017
Let me be clear with you.

33:49.153 --> 33:52.441
I do not wish that a motion as important as this

33:52.573 --> 33:55.531
should stand on a mere trick of procedure.

33:55.659 --> 33:57.741
Trick, you say?

33:57.870 --> 34:00.156
This is a religious matter.

34:00.289 --> 34:02.905
There are no tricks in religion.

34:05.377 --> 34:09.245
Session was not formally ended, correct?

34:11.050 --> 34:13.883
- Correct.
— So, when we reconvene,

34:14.011 --> 34:16.718
it will formally be the same session.

34:18.265 --> 34:21.507
Then Tribune Antony
may use veto on the motion.

34:28.359 --> 34:29.849
That is so.

34:31.028 --> 34:36.523
Juno lnferna! Senile old fool,
why didn't you say so to begin with?

34:36.659 --> 34:40.493
Mark Antony must not be harmed
or hindered in any way.

34:40.621 --> 34:41.827
— But...
— In any way!

34:41.956 --> 34:45.289
It is vitally important
that he be allowed to veto the motion.

34:45.417 --> 34:48.329
If he does not, Caesar is declared a traitor.

34:48.462 --> 34:50.828
Then he has no choice
but to oppose me openly,

34:50.965 --> 34:54.298
which means civil war.
Antony must not be harmed!

34:54.426 --> 34:56.633
Dominus, good news.

34:56.762 --> 34:59.549
The Senate will reconvene tomorrow.

34:59.682 --> 35:01.843
Formally, it is the same session,

35:01.976 --> 35:04.888
so you may yet exercise
your veto on the motion.

35:05.020 --> 35:07.887
Unless Pompey tries to stop me.

35:08.023 --> 35:10.480
True, he may very well try.

35:11.819 --> 35:13.901
Rally the men together.

35:14.613 --> 35:17.650
Vorenus...al| of them.

35:19.702 --> 35:22.159
Run and hide!

35:22.830 --> 35:25.037
Run and hide!

35:25.165 --> 35:32.207
The 13th are coming
and your men are all dead!

35:33.257 --> 35:35.248
I put extra nutmeg in, as you like it.

35:35.384 --> 35:37.750
Marry me, goddess.

35:37.886 --> 35:40.969
What, a porcine object like you?

35:41.098 --> 35:44.215
Besides, I am already wed,
thanks be to evil spirits.

35:44.351 --> 35:47.184
You're wrong, friend-wife.
He is a good man, your man.

35:47.771 --> 35:51.229
A good man you say?
For years and years, I'd lie awake at night

35:51.358 --> 35:53.895
and beg all the gods to send him home.

35:54.028 --> 35:59.148
I'd hear of this battle or that battle
and...l'd see him, clear as glass,

35:59.283 --> 36:01.615
lying dead and bloody in the mud somewhere.

36:05.372 --> 36:08.910
l was lonely. l was so lonely.

36:09.043 --> 36:11.079
For eight years | wept.

36:11.211 --> 36:15.750
Every day, the girls asking,
"When is Papa coming home?

36:15.883 --> 36:17.919
"Is it today? When?"

36:19.970 --> 36:24.259
And now he's home and | wish he was in Gaul.
He's a cold, mean brute.

36:24.391 --> 36:28.430
Not one loving word to me or his daughters,
not once since he has been home.

36:28.562 --> 36:31.929
He is no skilled hand with the women

36:32.066 --> 36:34.978
but in all these years I fought with him,
he never took a woman.

36:35.110 --> 36:38.102
"Pullo," he'd say to me, "Pullo, my old friend,

36:38.238 --> 36:40.320
"l have a wife back home, Niobe is her name

36:40.449 --> 36:43.361
"and she's worth more to me
than all the women of Gaul."

36:44.953 --> 36:47.911
I thank you for your kind words
but I know you lie.

36:50.000 --> 36:52.491
He's no friend of yours. He told me so.

36:52.628 --> 36:56.416
Why, he has an...i|l temper, him.
He'd say anything.

37:00.427 --> 37:05.091
Antony needs every man. If you can walk,
we rendezvous at the house of Atia.

37:12.106 --> 37:16.315
This is all l have left.
There will be more when | sell the slaves.

37:16.443 --> 37:20.402
Get the girls indoors and stay indoors
until you know it's safe.

37:26.954 --> 37:31.448
It saddens me that you are unhappy,
because I have a deep affection for you.

37:33.836 --> 37:36.122
When I return, we will talk.

37:49.059 --> 37:51.175
Well, this is a merry do.

37:53.981 --> 37:56.973
Octavia, my honey, look alive at least.

37:57.109 --> 38:00.567
Poor Antony must think himself dead
and swimming in Lethe water.

38:00.696 --> 38:03.688
Talk to the poor man, ask him questions.

38:04.825 --> 38:07.191
One would think she'd been
raised by Germans.

38:07.327 --> 38:11.661
General Antony,
does my mother's screaming irritate you?

38:12.332 --> 38:13.242
Excuse me?

38:13.375 --> 38:17.243
When you and my mother are in coitus,
there is a deal of screaming.

38:17.379 --> 38:22.999
| find it extremely irritating.
I wondered whether you did also.

38:23.135 --> 38:26.343
Or perhaps you like it?
A testament to your skills.

38:26.472 --> 38:30.556
So spiteful and for what?
You shame only yourself.

38:55.876 --> 38:57.912
She has you exact.

39:00.547 --> 39:03.755
We show our strength.
We show them who owns the Forum.

39:03.884 --> 39:07.468
But we do not touch them.
Antony must not be touched!

39:07.596 --> 39:09.837
— Kill them all, I say.
- None of that!

39:09.973 --> 39:15.309
Pompey's strict orders. Him who starts trouble
will be on a cross at nightfall.

39:15.437 --> 39:17.223
So no blood!

39:25.364 --> 39:29.698
Make a lane there! Make a lane there, I said!
Come on, you bastards!

39:58.105 --> 40:01.893
Rally to me. Rally to me.

40:02.025 --> 40:04.016
Rally to me!

40:13.620 --> 40:15.531
No blood!

40:32.764 --> 40:35.471
You have what you wanted, Cato.

40:35.601 --> 40:38.013
Caesar has no choice now.

40:38.145 --> 40:44.186
Come the spring, he will cross the Alps
with his legions and march on Rome.

40:54.077 --> 40:57.035
Five dead, three from flux, two from fighting.

40:57.164 --> 41:00.827
Ten under medics. Eight absent, believed fled.

41:00.959 --> 41:04.167
— Sir.
— Fighting strength, 236 head.

41:04.296 --> 41:06.912
Seventh Cohort. 12 dead.

41:07.049 --> 41:09.210
Six of flux, six of fighting.

41:09.343 --> 41:12.801
Three under medics.
Three absent, believed fled.

41:12.929 --> 41:15.136
Fighting strength, 242.

41:15.265 --> 41:18.974
Soldier, how far behind you is Mark Antony?

41:19.102 --> 41:21.184
No more than an hour, sir.

41:25.400 --> 41:27.482
— Sound assembly!
- Sir!

41:28.612 --> 41:35.484
By order of the Senate, Gaius Julius Caesar
is declared an enemy of Rome.

41:35.619 --> 41:40.409
All good citizens are bound
to do him harm if they are able.

42:02.562 --> 42:06.851
After all these years, Pompey surprises me.

42:08.443 --> 42:11.230
I had hoped to provoke
some kind of aggression, sure,

42:11.363 --> 42:14.605
but to try and kill a Tribune?

42:14.741 --> 42:17.118
In the Forum?

42:17.244 --> 42:20.202
The man's found
some hard black iron in his soul.

42:20.330 --> 42:24.790
I'm sure it was yon demented little worm
Cato who put him up to it.

42:24.918 --> 42:26.954
lt's excellent, this.

42:27.087 --> 42:28.668
So, what next?

42:28.797 --> 42:31.083
Let's see what the men have to say.

42:33.343 --> 42:35.425
Oh, don't do that!

42:36.805 --> 42:39.512
You look just right as you are.

42:39.641 --> 42:42.383
Like Leonidas at Thermopylae.

42:44.438 --> 42:46.303
Attention!

42:50.569 --> 42:52.605
Any of your people I can mention?

42:54.322 --> 42:58.486
Titus Pullo. Took the head off
the first man that came at me.

43:04.624 --> 43:11.496
Soldiers, Pompey and the Senate
have formally declared

43:11.631 --> 43:16.671
that Gaius Julius Caesar is an enemy of Rome.

43:16.803 --> 43:17.883
No!

43:18.013 --> 43:20.800
They have declared that I am a criminal.

43:22.392 --> 43:27.227
They have declared, in effect,
that all of you also are criminals!

43:27.355 --> 43:29.516
No!

43:29.649 --> 43:32.641
The Tribune's veto was not exercised.

43:32.778 --> 43:37.363
Peoples Tribune Mark Antony
and 50 men of the 13th

43:37.491 --> 43:40.983
were assaulted by a thousand head
of Pompeian scum.

43:41.119 --> 43:43.110
No!

43:46.208 --> 43:52.499
A Tribune of the plebs assaulted on the steps

43:52.631 --> 43:54.167
of the Senate House!

43:54.299 --> 43:57.166
Can you imagine a more terrible sacrilege?

43:57.302 --> 44:00.715
Our beloved Republic is
in the hands of madmen.

44:00.847 --> 44:05.261
This is a dark day
and I stand at a fork in the road.

44:05.393 --> 44:08.385
I can abide the law
and surrender my arms to the Senate

44:08.522 --> 44:11.889
and watch the Republic
fall to tyranny and chaos!

44:12.025 --> 44:16.644
Or, I can go home with my sword in my hand

44:16.780 --> 44:20.648
and run those maniacs to the Tarpeian Rock!

44:20.784 --> 44:23.491
Yeah! Yeah!

44:30.043 --> 44:32.534
Legionary Titus Pullo, step fonNard!

44:38.051 --> 44:39.712
Titus Pullo!

44:45.892 --> 44:50.477
When 50 brave men of the 13th
fought Pompey's thousand in the Forum

44:50.605 --> 44:52.812
and saved the Tribune,

44:52.941 --> 44:56.399
it was Legionary Titus Pullo
drew first blood!

44:57.654 --> 45:00.270
Here is 500 denarii.

45:02.784 --> 45:06.743
— Very grateful, sir.
— Are you with me, Titus Pullo?

45:06.872 --> 45:09.614
— Will you come with me to Rome?
- Yes.

45:09.749 --> 45:11.614
Yes, sir! Certainly!

45:11.751 --> 45:17.291
Titus Pullo is with me!
And you? Are you with me?

45:17.424 --> 45:20.382
Yeah!

46:14.481 --> 46:17.223
You're awake. Water?

46:19.486 --> 46:21.147
We're moving.

46:23.823 --> 46:26.485
The whole legion, sounds like. Where to?

46:27.577 --> 46:30.535
It's a river. What river?

46:34.125 --> 46:36.502
— This is the Rubicon.
- Stay calm.

46:36.628 --> 46:39.961
This is rebellion and treason
and I am no traitor!

46:40.090 --> 46:44.208
It's too late now. We're in Italy.
You're a rebel whether you like it or not.

46:44.344 --> 46:46.756
Caesar. Caesar, what have you done?

46:46.888 --> 46:50.380
He had no choice, had he?
Pompey did try to kill Mark Antony.

46:50.517 --> 46:53.384
— You should not dare make that argument.
- How's that?

46:53.520 --> 46:58.105
— You know who was being attacked.
— I don't know what you mean.

47:00.986 --> 47:03.693
It doesn't matter now.
We are all dead men anyway.

47:03.822 --> 47:07.440
We'll be hanging from crosses
in the Appian Way before the week's out.

47:07.575 --> 47:10.908
— We'll be all right. Have some water.
— Better to die of thirst.

47:11.037 --> 47:13.824
Don't be foolish. Drink.

47:18.044 --> 47:20.706
Caesar is in Italy!

47:24.509 --> 47:27.546
Caesar is in Italy!

47:30.724 --> 47:33.056
— Have you heard?
- I heard.

47:53.079 --> 47:56.116
— What's going to happen?
- War is going to happen.

48:02.922 --> 48:05.584
Who's my greedy little pig?
