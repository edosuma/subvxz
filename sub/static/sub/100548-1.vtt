01:02.424 --> 01:05.325
<i>By the time
Stephen and I graduated in '73,</i>

01:05.327 --> 01:08.530
<i>half of South Africa
was in flames.</i>

01:12.200 --> 01:14.968
<i>The police were shooting
black kids like rabbits</i>

01:14.970 --> 01:18.171
<i>whilst the other half
sipped piña coladas</i>

01:18.173 --> 01:20.108
<i>on their whites-only beaches.</i>

01:22.745 --> 01:25.278
<i>Growing up under apartheid</i>

01:25.280 --> 01:28.383
<i>meant the segregation of people
by the colour of their skin.</i>

01:30.385 --> 01:32.051
<i>And as our eyes opened,</i>

01:32.053 --> 01:34.587
<i>the naked reality of apartheid
stood before us.</i>

01:34.589 --> 01:36.256
I was born like this!

01:36.258 --> 01:39.361
I'm not ashamed to be a Saffer.
Ask in the eyes of God!

01:41.062 --> 01:44.130
<i>What we'd always accepted,
we would now reject.</i>

01:50.605 --> 01:53.673
<i>We didn't want a life
built on lies and indifference.</i>

01:54.777 --> 01:57.277
<i>We wanted to join
the ongoing struggle</i>

01:57.279 --> 01:59.646
<i>for a democratic and free
South Africa</i>

01:59.648 --> 02:02.584
<i>not based on
racial discrimination.</i>

02:27.509 --> 02:30.276
<i>But unless we got up
from our privileged white lives</i>

02:30.278 --> 02:34.082
<i>and did something,
our words were meaningless.</i>

02:37.185 --> 02:40.620
<i>What we chose to do was
the most radical of all things</i>

02:40.622 --> 02:44.190
<i>and without doubt
the most explosive.</i>

04:01.436 --> 04:04.706
<i>We joined the prohibited
African National Congress...</i>

04:09.344 --> 04:11.210
<i>and ran
anti-apartheid missions</i>

04:11.212 --> 04:13.914
<i>alongside our black and Asian
brothers and sisters,</i>

04:13.916 --> 04:17.584
<i>spreading the news that freedom
and equality for all races</i>

04:17.586 --> 04:21.387
<i>should be fought for
at all costs.</i>

04:21.389 --> 04:22.823
- Let's go!
- Aren't we going to watch?

04:22.825 --> 04:24.390
No, Stephen, we don't
have time for this, OK?

04:24.392 --> 04:25.761
Let's just...

04:30.766 --> 04:32.634
They're closing in on us.

04:38.841 --> 04:40.841
Hey, you! Stay where you are!

04:45.647 --> 04:48.483
<i>And the costs were greater
than either of us imagined.</i>

05:08.570 --> 05:11.571
I've got you the money. Don't
let them catch you with it.

05:11.573 --> 05:13.272
They will add another 12 years
to your life.

05:13.274 --> 05:14.842
- Make sure you don't appeal.
- I won't.

05:14.844 --> 05:16.509
I'm not begging
some fascist bastard judge

05:16.511 --> 05:17.710
to come take pity on us.

05:17.712 --> 05:19.481
Give it to me.

05:25.821 --> 05:28.488
Whatever happens in there,
don't give up.

05:28.490 --> 05:29.925
I won't.

05:33.461 --> 05:35.196
Go, go, go. I love you.

06:04.760 --> 06:06.428
OK.

06:22.444 --> 06:25.280
All rise.

06:27.649 --> 06:32.822
The Republic of South Africa v.
Timothy Jenkin and Stephen Lee.

06:40.662 --> 06:43.463
My commendation
to the prosecution.

06:43.465 --> 06:45.966
A very well put case.

06:45.968 --> 06:49.569
The retrieval of
17 custom-built devices

06:49.571 --> 06:53.708
for 26 separate bombings
is no small thing.

06:55.376 --> 06:58.611
But laying out
the most pernicious aspects

06:58.613 --> 07:02.315
of this ANC ideology...

07:02.317 --> 07:06.319
that all races are equal
and all this sort of thing

07:06.321 --> 07:09.489
has been the strongest part
of your case.

07:09.491 --> 07:12.492
And if I'm to understand it
correctly,

07:12.494 --> 07:15.996
one of the defendants' fathers
is an eminent pharmacologist

07:15.998 --> 07:19.501
and the other a scholar
in the humanities.

07:20.836 --> 07:22.938
This country raised you.

07:25.340 --> 07:27.107
It gave birth to you

07:27.109 --> 07:31.477
and it provided
all your worldly needs.

07:31.479 --> 07:35.017
And this is how
you choose to repay it?

07:37.853 --> 07:40.486
The State of South Africa
now tells you

07:40.488 --> 07:44.390
the price you will pay
in return.

07:44.392 --> 07:46.392
And so,

07:46.394 --> 07:52.665
defendant number one and chief
bomb maker, Timothy Jenkin,

07:52.667 --> 07:54.835
you are sentenced
to imprisonment

07:54.837 --> 07:57.403
for a total of 12 years.

07:59.674 --> 08:03.543
And defendant number two,
the accomplice, Stephen Lee,

08:03.545 --> 08:05.511
you are sentenced
to imprisonment

08:05.513 --> 08:08.349
for a total of eight years.

08:09.384 --> 08:10.751
Sentences are to commence

08:10.753 --> 08:14.056
at Pretoria Political Prison
for White Males.

08:15.758 --> 08:17.960
So... that's that.

08:19.694 --> 08:21.462
All rise.

08:30.906 --> 08:32.539
Sit there!

09:08.077 --> 09:09.879
Shit! Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

09:11.113 --> 09:12.846
Let's talk about this,
man, alright?

09:12.848 --> 09:14.582
Let's talk. Let me esca...

09:31.901 --> 09:34.567
Keep your mouth shut in there!

09:34.569 --> 09:37.137
Alright?!

09:37.139 --> 09:39.775
- How's it?
- How's it?

10:25.955 --> 10:28.554
At last, the leaflet
bombers are here, hmm?

10:28.556 --> 10:30.090
And after all your fancy tricks,

10:30.092 --> 10:32.993
you're reduced to jumping
from windows like rats, huh?

10:32.995 --> 10:34.928
Hey!

10:34.930 --> 10:38.133
No-one forced you to traitor
your country and your race!

10:39.101 --> 10:40.836
You are the white Mandela.

10:42.938 --> 10:44.907
You are the most deluded
of them all.

10:47.943 --> 10:49.610
Van der Merwe!

10:51.113 --> 10:52.813
Read it!

10:52.815 --> 10:55.882
"No pens, no radio,
no newspapers.

10:55.884 --> 10:57.550
"No political conversation.

10:57.552 --> 11:00.686
"No parcels larger than
the size of a 6" x 4" envelope.

11:00.688 --> 11:03.223
"Visitors once per month,
subject to state vetting.

11:03.225 --> 11:06.226
"And there is to be
no sexual activity of any kind"

11:06.228 --> 11:08.694
"anywhere on the premises."

11:08.696 --> 11:10.531
Here! Step on the line.

11:12.735 --> 11:14.768
Step over the line.

11:14.770 --> 11:16.671
Disengage the grille door.

11:20.209 --> 11:22.277
Move.

11:26.749 --> 11:28.649
Up to the line.

11:36.925 --> 11:38.559
Proceed.

11:44.266 --> 11:45.766
Move.

12:01.950 --> 12:03.684
Come on, move!

12:11.026 --> 12:12.761
In.

12:24.173 --> 12:26.075
39378.

12:27.910 --> 12:29.445
In.

12:33.315 --> 12:35.050
Turn.

12:39.021 --> 12:40.856
Move!

12:59.274 --> 13:01.274
Alright, pube lice!

13:01.276 --> 13:04.177
Lights out 11:00,
morning bell 5:00,

13:04.179 --> 13:06.346
breakfast 7:30.

13:06.348 --> 13:08.815
I like my cells
clean as a plate.

13:08.817 --> 13:12.252
Remember that and you'll live
a long and prosperous life.

13:12.254 --> 13:15.656
Now... total silence!

14:44.513 --> 14:46.181
Step away from the grille.

15:00.862 --> 15:02.896
Best bloody kip in years.

15:02.898 --> 15:04.531
I could get used to this.

15:04.533 --> 15:06.466
Fall out!

15:06.468 --> 15:08.802
Idiot.

15:08.804 --> 15:10.772
Go. Walk. Walk!

15:15.377 --> 15:17.913
Alright, guys,
move along. Move along.

15:37.266 --> 15:40.867
Alright, quieten down.
Let's keep it down, guys.

15:40.869 --> 15:43.003
Walk. Walk.

15:43.005 --> 15:44.773
Go on.

15:46.041 --> 15:47.509
Sit.

15:48.477 --> 15:50.143
Thank you.

15:50.145 --> 15:51.544
Don't sit there.

15:51.546 --> 15:53.446
We are segregated, my friend.

15:53.448 --> 15:55.982
They wear blue shirts
for a reason.

15:55.984 --> 15:58.351
Unless you want to sit
next to a murderer.

15:58.353 --> 16:00.856
No. This is... this is good.

16:05.127 --> 16:06.893
Kitson.

16:12.367 --> 16:14.803
Alright, quiet down, huh?

16:16.471 --> 16:18.373
What was that?

16:20.342 --> 16:22.142
Can I join you, gentlemen?

16:22.144 --> 16:24.044
- Can I...?
- Please.

16:24.046 --> 16:26.313
We've heard about you two.

16:26.315 --> 16:29.249
- We've heard about you.
- Yeah. It's... it's an honour.

16:29.251 --> 16:31.051
How many years?

16:31.053 --> 16:34.321
Eight for me. 12 for him.

16:34.323 --> 16:37.159
Ja, but we don't plan
on staying that long.

16:39.161 --> 16:41.094
Hold on to that anger.

16:41.096 --> 16:44.499
It reminds you there's
another world outside all this.

16:50.906 --> 16:52.939
Nobody said stop. Move!

16:52.941 --> 16:55.308
Calm down, now.

16:55.310 --> 16:57.944
Oh, dear. Oh, dear.

16:57.946 --> 17:01.981
Ladies, we're going to call
this one Potluck.

17:03.418 --> 17:05.287
One for each slop, my friend.

17:11.660 --> 17:14.229
Damned bastards!

17:16.031 --> 17:18.599
Come on. Get it over there.

17:19.667 --> 17:21.367
Good boy.

17:29.578 --> 17:32.011
Something's weighing you down,
I think.

17:32.013 --> 17:33.582
Are you packing?

17:35.150 --> 17:37.217
You can tell by the way you run
you've got at least

17:37.219 --> 17:39.552
a bottle of beer
and some glasses up there.

17:39.554 --> 17:42.891
Cigar tubes. 360 rand.

17:44.393 --> 17:46.693
Expensive tastes.

17:46.695 --> 17:49.131
Let me give you the guided tour.

17:50.966 --> 17:54.300
In case you're wondering,
it's 20 foot high.

17:54.302 --> 17:59.239
The barbed wire's flailed so
it traps right under your skin.

17:59.241 --> 18:02.409
Searchlights.
On from sundown to sunrise.

18:02.411 --> 18:04.745
Covers every inch of the yard.

18:04.747 --> 18:08.481
Boers with guns
from lockup till dawn.

18:08.483 --> 18:11.586
There's nothing they'd like more
than to pump holes into you.

18:16.124 --> 18:19.559
And tunnels in any direction,

18:19.561 --> 18:22.195
they just lead you back
onto prison property.

18:22.197 --> 18:25.700
Apart from that wall.
It lines a public street.

18:34.209 --> 18:36.075
I knew a chap one time.

18:36.077 --> 18:39.312
No matter how hard he tried,
he couldn't get his money out.

18:39.314 --> 18:42.048
And the whole thing
got infected.

18:42.050 --> 18:45.251
The point I'm making is,
everybody comes in here going

18:45.253 --> 18:47.389
they're gonna break out of here
by next week.

18:49.224 --> 18:51.624
We are prisoners of conscience.

18:51.626 --> 18:53.628
So it's different for us.

18:54.663 --> 18:56.665
But we're prisoners of war.

18:59.134 --> 19:02.068
All the same,
I've got a hiding place.

19:02.070 --> 19:03.636
I'll keep it safe for you.

19:03.638 --> 19:06.141
Get it out before
it rots you inside.

19:20.088 --> 19:23.325
He pours cold water on
any poor bastard with a plan.

19:24.326 --> 19:26.593
I don't talk to him.

19:26.595 --> 19:28.695
So there have been attempts?

19:28.697 --> 19:30.532
Some go a little...

19:32.802 --> 19:36.269
some a little more,
but no-one go out.

19:36.271 --> 19:39.072
Always a first time.

19:39.074 --> 19:40.707
That's my thoughts exactly.

19:40.709 --> 19:42.675
It is a duty for us.

19:42.677 --> 19:45.779
I don't do this "prisoner
of conscience" bullshit.

19:45.781 --> 19:49.215
If you're having a plan,
I join you.

19:49.217 --> 19:50.483
<i>Time!</i>

19:50.485 --> 19:52.118
The cell is a concrete tomb.

19:52.120 --> 19:54.087
Only way out is
through the grille.

19:54.089 --> 19:55.722
You tell me when
you have something.

19:55.724 --> 19:58.159
<i>Back to your cells!</i>

20:26.354 --> 20:28.856
<i>Every prison has its doyen,</i>

20:28.858 --> 20:32.060
<i>and for us politicals
it was Denis Goldberg.</i>

20:33.628 --> 20:35.562
<i>He'd been given
four life sentences</i>

20:35.564 --> 20:37.731
<i>for trying to overthrow
the apartheid government</i>

20:37.733 --> 20:39.434
<i>by violent revolution...</i>

20:40.870 --> 20:43.605
<i>in the same trial
as Mandela and Sisulu.</i>

20:48.209 --> 20:49.845
<i>He was royalty.</i>

21:44.566 --> 21:49.337
<i>For many nights, I sat on
my bed and stared at the lock.</i>

21:52.842 --> 21:55.410
<i>I tried a hundred ideas
in my mind...</i>

21:56.544 --> 22:00.281
<i>and then I tried
a hundred more.</i>

22:04.987 --> 22:11.226
<i>It sat there staring back at me
every single night.</i>

22:14.229 --> 22:17.296
<i>And then it dawned on me.</i>

22:17.298 --> 22:19.367
<i>You don't have to know
everything.</i>

22:21.003 --> 22:22.635
<i>You only have to know enough.</i>

22:22.637 --> 22:23.971
Now, quiet!

22:23.973 --> 22:28.243
<i>You start with what you know
and you work backwards.</i>

23:37.880 --> 23:39.915
Hey. We've got something.

23:41.851 --> 23:44.051
We're not doing anything
that involves digging.

23:44.053 --> 23:46.387
No. We make keys.

23:47.056 --> 23:48.354
What?

23:48.356 --> 23:49.857
Wait, wait. Listen.

23:49.859 --> 23:52.092
I measured the lock with
a pencil and drawing paper...

23:52.094 --> 23:54.862
You want to make a key with
pencil and drawing paper?

23:54.864 --> 23:56.496
No, no. From wood.

23:56.498 --> 23:59.465
Oh. You crazy. It break.

23:59.467 --> 24:00.934
It won't break
if you go against the grain.

24:00.936 --> 24:03.536
There's a reason
keys are made out of metal.

24:03.538 --> 24:05.673
I thought there was a first
for everything.

24:10.079 --> 24:11.912
OK.

24:11.914 --> 24:13.446
Where you get the wood from?

24:13.448 --> 24:16.351
- From the workshop.
- Heads up. Heads up.

24:20.122 --> 24:21.891
Three minutes.

24:23.993 --> 24:25.795
Move along, you guys.

24:27.763 --> 24:29.531
Silence.

24:31.499 --> 24:33.834
Look at the keys
when he comes over.

24:33.836 --> 24:35.501
Watch closely.

24:36.638 --> 24:39.505
No, no, no!
You have lost your mind!

24:39.507 --> 24:40.974
What are you talking about?!

24:40.976 --> 24:42.810
- What is this?
- Oh, nothing, meneer.

24:42.812 --> 24:44.443
No fighting. We're just talking.

24:44.445 --> 24:45.846
Not much peace and harmony

24:45.848 --> 24:47.915
among you white Mandelas, huh?

24:47.917 --> 24:49.448
No, no.

24:49.450 --> 24:50.853
Kaffir work.

24:52.955 --> 24:54.888
You're both confined
to your cell. Now!

24:54.890 --> 24:56.622
It's ridiculous.

24:56.624 --> 24:57.958
Are you guys gonna clean it up?

24:57.960 --> 25:00.830
Mongo here's gonna
look after you, eh?

25:04.166 --> 25:05.899
He didn't do anything.

25:05.901 --> 25:08.536
You want to play with him? Ja?

25:09.470 --> 25:11.104
Then play still!

25:11.106 --> 25:13.843
Potluck! Get your black,
fat arse here now!

25:16.011 --> 25:17.610
Here!

25:17.612 --> 25:19.545
Alright, guys, move along.

25:19.547 --> 25:21.884
Quiet! Quieten down!

25:22.818 --> 25:24.717
Be quiet!

25:24.719 --> 25:26.521
You clean that up!

26:00.622 --> 26:02.490
Next! Move it along!

26:04.459 --> 26:05.928
Next in line!

26:07.595 --> 26:10.733
OK, next prisoner!
Come on, move it!

26:12.835 --> 26:14.569
OK, next!

26:51.706 --> 26:53.574
Clear down!

27:27.176 --> 27:28.875
Oh, shit!

27:28.877 --> 27:30.779
What an idiot.

27:34.750 --> 27:36.251
Halt!

27:42.891 --> 27:44.825
Just Lee.

27:44.827 --> 27:46.962
Everybody else clear down.

27:56.939 --> 27:58.639
File in!

28:05.781 --> 28:07.548
Here!

28:36.345 --> 28:38.945
You know, your look
is very intense, Jenkin.

28:38.947 --> 28:40.715
Sorry.

28:41.682 --> 28:43.150
"Sorry, MENEER."

28:43.152 --> 28:44.853
Sorry, meneer.

31:20.108 --> 31:22.077
Oh...

31:28.250 --> 31:31.017
So all we have to do
is make a really complex key...

31:31.019 --> 31:32.454
Silence.

31:34.056 --> 31:35.922
Is make a really complex key,

31:35.924 --> 31:38.291
then get it to reach a keyhole
on the other side

31:38.293 --> 31:40.460
of a steel-panel,
three-inch-thick iron door

31:40.462 --> 31:42.397
to which we have
totally no access?

31:45.133 --> 31:46.802
Total crazy.

31:47.836 --> 31:49.304
I love it.

33:17.392 --> 33:19.328
Ah, yes!

33:22.564 --> 33:24.966
Yes, yes!

33:38.680 --> 33:40.046
Oh!

33:40.048 --> 33:41.583
No, no! No!

33:45.487 --> 33:47.187
Tim. Tim, Tim, Tim, Tim!

33:47.189 --> 33:48.990
Somebody's coming. Quick!

34:05.040 --> 34:08.274
No, no. Come on, come out.
Come out. Get out.

34:08.275 --> 34:10.510
Tim! Tim!

34:15.183 --> 34:16.516
Come on!

36:37.745 --> 36:40.524
I punched a boy at school.

36:42.243 --> 36:43.370
Why?

36:45.038 --> 36:46.829
Because he called me a bastard

36:46.831 --> 36:49.624
and he said I don't have a Papa...

36:49.626 --> 36:51.211
but that's not true.

36:54.089 --> 36:55.840
I'm sorry.

36:57.592 --> 36:59.052
What have I done?

37:00.136 --> 37:02.248
Are you angry with me Papa?

37:02.250 --> 37:04.653
Non. Non.

37:04.655 --> 37:06.182
I'm not angry at all.

37:06.184 --> 37:08.226
This is my best day

37:08.228 --> 37:10.353
in the whole year...

37:10.355 --> 37:12.023
seeing you.

37:14.275 --> 37:17.443
Mum says when they let you go,

37:17.445 --> 37:20.365
I'm going to have a beard
and be 23 years old.

37:21.157 --> 37:23.408
Is that true?

37:23.410 --> 37:24.703
I promise you...

37:25.328 --> 37:28.331
I won't be here much longer.

37:29.444 --> 37:30.911
Back off!

37:30.913 --> 37:32.679
What's the matter with you?
You are scaring him!

37:32.681 --> 37:35.181
Play still and lean away,
or I cut the children.

37:35.183 --> 37:36.616
What is wrong with you people?!

37:36.618 --> 37:39.552
OK. This session is terminated.
Get the woman in here.

37:39.554 --> 37:41.454
OK. OK, I'm s... I'm sorry.

37:41.456 --> 37:43.656
Get him out of here.
This session's over.

37:43.658 --> 37:44.981
Come Antoine!

37:44.983 --> 37:47.427
Please. This is less than
30 minutes. Please. Please.

37:47.429 --> 37:49.600
- No, please! Please!
- Allez, viens, Antoine. Vite.

37:49.602 --> 37:51.310
What's happening with her visa?

37:51.312 --> 37:53.760
They rejected it again.
We're going to appeal.

37:53.762 --> 37:55.565
- Finished! It's finished!
- Is she well?

37:55.567 --> 37:57.025
Is she well? How is she?

37:57.027 --> 37:59.276
She wishes you "happy
fifth wedding anniversary".

37:59.278 --> 38:01.967
Enough of this French shit.
Get out! Now! Out!

38:01.969 --> 38:03.448
She's moving to Bordeaux.

38:03.450 --> 38:04.878
I'm sorry.

38:04.880 --> 38:06.512
- Papa!
- I'm sorry, Leonard.

38:06.514 --> 38:07.881
- Papa!
- Stop shouting.

38:07.883 --> 38:09.752
Papa! Papa!

38:11.954 --> 38:15.457
Get your...! Hey! Hey!

38:19.729 --> 38:22.130
17. Go!

38:35.644 --> 38:37.379
15 seconds.

38:46.588 --> 38:48.791
How, uh... how is your son?

39:00.335 --> 39:03.271
OK. Let's go again.

39:04.940 --> 39:06.608
Go!

39:08.778 --> 39:11.711
- He had a bad visit.
- Ja, I heard.

39:11.713 --> 39:14.784
And you?
How is your father doing?

39:15.751 --> 39:17.450
I don't know.

39:17.452 --> 39:19.454
He's sick.

39:20.689 --> 39:23.391
We need to get out of here.

39:25.527 --> 39:27.295
I think I have an idea.

39:30.532 --> 39:32.534
Antoine, he made me a kite.

39:33.936 --> 39:37.505
It has a small spindle
of fine black thread on it.

39:38.707 --> 39:42.644
I can tie the key at both ends,
put it across.

39:46.381 --> 39:47.950
Et voilà.

39:52.287 --> 39:54.620
I liked the pulley idea.

39:54.622 --> 39:56.656
Mmm.

39:56.658 --> 39:58.591
- No.
- What?

39:58.593 --> 40:04.765
If you can't turn it,
it's... just totally pointless.

40:04.767 --> 40:06.734
Totally pointless?

40:06.736 --> 40:08.436
OK.

40:09.671 --> 40:13.406
Well, what can take us
from this to this?

40:13.408 --> 40:16.309
That we have access to
from inside the cell.

40:16.311 --> 40:17.577
Exactly.

40:17.579 --> 40:19.479
You see, that's why
the string is smart.

40:19.481 --> 40:21.647
We can keep it here
and they'll never work out...

40:21.649 --> 40:23.753
Afternoon, meneer.

40:33.528 --> 40:35.028
What were you talking about?

40:35.030 --> 40:38.732
Nothing, meneer.
We were just talking.

40:38.734 --> 40:40.734
- Yeah.
- Sweeping, yeah?

40:40.736 --> 40:42.972
Clean cell, clean heart, meneer.

40:45.975 --> 40:47.743
Perhaps.

41:15.403 --> 41:17.370
- OK, he's gone.
- How long was he there for?

41:17.372 --> 41:19.372
Did he hear us?
Did he hear anything?

41:19.374 --> 41:20.874
We weren't saying
anything incriminating.

41:20.876 --> 41:23.676
OK. OK, if he ask
question of us,

41:23.678 --> 41:26.579
we were just talking about...
we talk about string, huh?

41:26.581 --> 41:28.782
For how we hang up the broom.
Huh? That's it.

41:28.784 --> 41:31.352
- We forget everything else.
- Wait, wait, wait.

41:35.925 --> 41:38.526
Oh, yeah, yeah. Give it to me.

41:49.872 --> 41:51.539
Ha.

41:52.607 --> 41:54.107
Oh, yes.

41:54.109 --> 41:55.876
Oh!

41:55.878 --> 41:57.878
Going...

41:57.880 --> 41:59.478
You get it?

41:59.480 --> 42:01.514
- Not quite.
- Any more?

44:46.949 --> 44:48.647
Oh, no.

44:51.353 --> 44:53.088
Shit!

45:52.680 --> 45:54.116
OK. OK.

45:56.251 --> 45:57.986
Ja.

47:06.088 --> 47:07.420
So?

47:07.422 --> 47:09.022
Look.

47:09.024 --> 47:10.457
I have not slept all night.

47:10.459 --> 47:11.758
But you did it?

47:11.760 --> 47:14.997
- Mm-hm. Both doors.
- Really?

47:16.398 --> 47:19.366
You actually opened...
both the doors?

47:19.368 --> 47:21.103
Ja. I actually did.

47:24.072 --> 47:25.908
Très bien.

47:34.850 --> 47:36.318
Rubbish?

47:41.456 --> 47:44.090
Nice work.

47:44.092 --> 47:46.326
Hey, we're not going to be able
to see it flower.

47:49.064 --> 47:51.099
That's the street outside.

47:52.067 --> 47:54.369
What the hell is that noise?

47:58.040 --> 47:59.775
Heads up.

48:13.455 --> 48:15.123
Hey!

48:36.411 --> 48:38.180
Shit.

48:54.229 --> 48:55.829
What was he doing here?

48:55.831 --> 48:58.164
Uh, he was fetching
my yard waste, meneer.

48:58.166 --> 49:01.134
Yeah, I saw that, cheese dick.
He's not on garden duty.

49:01.136 --> 49:03.472
Why is he collecting from you?
Why not him?

49:05.974 --> 49:07.442
From now on...

49:08.577 --> 49:11.044
you clean up your own shit.

49:11.046 --> 49:12.814
Ja, meneer.

49:24.593 --> 49:26.559
The captain has ordered
a crackdown.

49:26.561 --> 49:30.196
That's why they're all
so spooked.

49:30.198 --> 49:32.098
So, before you do
whatever it is you're doing,

49:32.100 --> 49:34.334
make sure you can get clear
of those snipers.

49:34.336 --> 49:37.404
- Ja. We're figuring it out.
- Yes, well, figure carefully.

49:37.406 --> 49:40.540
You fail, you'll get 25 years
if you're lucky.

49:40.542 --> 49:43.343
A bullet in the head
if you're not.

49:43.345 --> 49:46.980
The sniper on that gun walk
is a complete psychopath.

49:46.982 --> 49:49.049
I heard he shot some kids
in Joburg

49:49.051 --> 49:52.352
and they posted him here
to cool down.

49:52.354 --> 49:54.321
I'll keep looking out for you.

49:54.323 --> 49:57.157
But your whole plan
is doomed to failure.

49:57.159 --> 49:58.591
One of these mornings,

49:58.593 --> 50:00.595
I hope you're going to
wake up and see it.

50:07.469 --> 50:09.604
You're young. And I like you.

50:11.006 --> 50:13.606
But you're part of
a movement now.

50:13.608 --> 50:15.911
What you do affects everyone.

50:18.914 --> 50:20.549
Ja, so help us.

51:10.065 --> 51:12.265
But if we can unlock three
doors, we can unlock 20...

51:12.267 --> 51:14.100
You don't even know
how many there are.

51:14.102 --> 51:15.368
It doesn't matter if it's 100.

51:15.370 --> 51:17.203
If they've got a lock,
we can make a key.

51:17.205 --> 51:19.005
Well, what about
the street outside?

51:19.007 --> 51:21.074
We need civilian clothes.
Other stuff. Quarters nearby.

51:21.076 --> 51:22.409
How do we get out
of the country?

51:22.411 --> 51:23.744
We are working on it.
One step at a time.

51:23.746 --> 51:25.245
There's too many unknowns!

51:25.247 --> 51:26.312
And we'll figure them out.
Be patient.

51:26.314 --> 51:28.715
<i>You</i> need to have patience
with <i>us.</i>

51:28.717 --> 51:31.117
Take patience from the others.
I'm not giving.

51:31.119 --> 51:33.253
20 years, I've been in here!

51:33.255 --> 51:37.190
And once a year,
they give me 30 minutes.

51:37.192 --> 51:41.196
30 minutes.
Alone with my own son.

51:42.765 --> 51:44.433
They try to break us.

51:45.735 --> 51:47.467
No more patience.

51:47.469 --> 51:49.304
We fight back!

51:51.774 --> 51:53.373
He's erratic.

51:53.375 --> 51:56.109
He's made a choice.
What about you?

51:56.111 --> 51:58.013
- Are you...
- Alright, listen!

52:03.718 --> 52:06.054
We are all on the same side.

52:25.207 --> 52:29.108
<i>In prison,
nothing stays the same,</i>

52:29.110 --> 52:32.748
<i>and yet nothing changes.</i>

52:34.716 --> 52:39.686
<i>The routine is the only thing
that gives time any meaning.</i>

52:39.688 --> 52:41.789
<i>So you use it.</i>

52:41.791 --> 52:44.292
<i>You use everything.</i>

52:46.528 --> 52:49.730
<i>You find the cracks
in their armour</i>

52:49.732 --> 52:53.433
<i>and you exploit them
to the fullest extent</i>

52:53.435 --> 52:56.304
<i>day after day after day.</i>

53:27.702 --> 53:29.636
<i>And through those cracks,</i>

53:29.638 --> 53:33.475
<i>in the uneventful footnotes
of prison life...</i>

53:35.210 --> 53:37.243
<i>victory is won.</i>

53:37.245 --> 53:40.280
<i>That's how you beat
the fascists -</i>

53:40.282 --> 53:43.485
<i>one act of resistance
after another.</i>

53:46.187 --> 53:47.687
- Kitson.
- How's it?

53:47.689 --> 53:50.123
Are you still in charge
of the movie closet?

53:50.125 --> 53:51.725
I'm going there tonight.

53:51.727 --> 53:53.562
When do they let you
have the key?

54:43.311 --> 54:44.780
Your order.

54:45.881 --> 54:47.549
Oh.

54:59.194 --> 55:00.761
Ja, I can see clearly now.

55:00.763 --> 55:02.464
Little prick.

55:03.799 --> 55:05.598
Ah! Potluck.

55:05.600 --> 55:08.769
That black little rat
you used to hang out with.

55:08.771 --> 55:11.339
Got stretched three days ago.

55:12.474 --> 55:15.341
I hear they had to
winch him up twice.

55:15.343 --> 55:17.745
Twitching and frothing
in his noose.

55:17.747 --> 55:19.512
Armed robbery,

55:19.514 --> 55:22.783
and he gets a free education
and statutory funeral.

55:22.785 --> 55:26.154
More than his worthless natives
could ever give to him, huh?

55:28.256 --> 55:29.691
Enjoy your glasses.

55:50.780 --> 55:52.681
I won't give up.

Come on, come on. Get in, quick.

59:50.551 --> 59:52.687
No, no, no!

01:01:32.755 --> 01:01:34.223
OK.

01:02:14.997 --> 01:02:17.332
- We try it.
- Ja, ja. OK, OK.

01:02:35.650 --> 01:02:37.585
Careful it doesn't break.

01:03:09.852 --> 01:03:12.752
- That's enough. That's enough.
- Wait. Wait!

01:03:12.754 --> 01:03:14.957
That's enough. Come on. Come on.

01:03:55.464 --> 01:03:58.298
Oh, for crying out loud!

01:04:08.010 --> 01:04:09.876
Leave it. Leave it. Come on.

01:04:09.878 --> 01:04:11.880
Come on. Come on, come on!

01:04:57.359 --> 01:04:59.261
Hmm.

01:06:55.277 --> 01:06:57.110
Stand outside your cell.

01:07:11.426 --> 01:07:13.059
Are you sick, Jenkin?

01:07:13.061 --> 01:07:14.561
No, Captain.

01:07:14.563 --> 01:07:17.330
You have some sort of
auditory problem?

01:07:17.332 --> 01:07:19.032
Some infection or something?

01:07:19.034 --> 01:07:20.400
No, Captain.

01:07:20.402 --> 01:07:22.268
OK. OK.

01:07:22.270 --> 01:07:24.170
So the bell rang
and you heard it.

01:07:24.172 --> 01:07:25.874
Why didn't you wake up?

01:07:27.676 --> 01:07:29.342
I'm sorry, Captain.

01:07:29.344 --> 01:07:32.147
Oh, you're sorry? Oh, well,
that's touched my heart.

01:07:33.415 --> 01:07:35.014
Let me tell you something.

01:07:35.016 --> 01:07:37.517
When you hear the lunchtime bell
go this afternoon

01:07:37.519 --> 01:07:39.452
and you hear the suppertime bell
go this evening,

01:07:39.454 --> 01:07:40.720
you will remain in your cell

01:07:40.722 --> 01:07:42.555
and I'm not going to
give you any food.

01:07:42.557 --> 01:07:44.057
How does that sound, hmm?

01:07:44.059 --> 01:07:46.192
I'm... I'm terribly sorry,
Captain.

01:07:46.194 --> 01:07:49.162
Oh, <i>terribly</i> sorry now, is it?

01:07:49.164 --> 01:07:54.567
You joined a terrorist gang
of dirty black Rottweilers

01:07:54.569 --> 01:07:57.237
and they chewed you up
and they spat you out

01:07:57.239 --> 01:07:59.472
and now you're stuck in here
with me! Hmm?

01:07:59.474 --> 01:08:02.342
And 20 years' experience
in this job tells me

01:08:02.344 --> 01:08:04.677
you slept through my bed
because you're tired,

01:08:04.679 --> 01:08:08.448
and you're tired because
you're not sleeping, hmm?

01:08:08.450 --> 01:08:10.185
Why aren't you sleeping?

01:08:12.154 --> 01:08:13.989
I asked you a question.

01:08:15.290 --> 01:08:17.290
I-I'm sorry, Captain.

01:08:17.292 --> 01:08:19.626
Oh, "I'm sorry, Captain." Hmm.

01:08:19.627 --> 01:08:21.294
"I'm sorry, Captain."

01:08:21.296 --> 01:08:23.265
No, no, no, no. I can smell it.

01:08:24.332 --> 01:08:25.765
I'm sorry, Capt...

01:08:25.768 --> 01:08:29.270
Don't you ever
sleep through my bell again!

01:08:30.372 --> 01:08:31.537
Did you hear me
that time, Jenkin?

01:08:31.540 --> 01:08:33.473
- Ja, Captain.
- Mmm. That's good.

01:08:33.475 --> 01:08:36.044
OK, now, go and stand outside.
Go on. Go on.

01:08:41.283 --> 01:08:42.482
No, stand there.

01:08:42.484 --> 01:08:44.283
Look at me
when I'm talking to you.

01:08:44.286 --> 01:08:46.152
Please. It's my son.

01:08:48.791 --> 01:08:51.291
Look at me when I'm
talking to you! Stand there!

01:08:51.292 --> 01:08:52.725
- Please...
- Don't bloody move!

01:08:52.728 --> 01:08:54.227
Please. It's of my son.

01:08:54.229 --> 01:08:56.362
I am allowed to have a picture.
It's of my son.

01:08:56.363 --> 01:08:59.064
No. No. No. No, no, no, don't...

01:09:02.404 --> 01:09:04.038
Don't you touch them!

01:09:05.207 --> 01:09:07.774
- Do not touch me!
- On your knees, man!

01:09:07.777 --> 01:09:10.510
- No, no! No!
- Just shut up!

01:09:10.511 --> 01:09:12.779
They're mine! They're mine!

01:09:12.782 --> 01:09:14.447
They are mine!

01:09:14.448 --> 01:09:16.416
They are mine! You fascists!

01:09:16.417 --> 01:09:19.219
Fascists! They are mine,
you fascists!

01:09:19.220 --> 01:09:21.287
Don't touch them! They are mine!

01:09:21.288 --> 01:09:23.791
They are mine! They are mine!

01:09:23.792 --> 01:09:27.193
Don't you do it!
Don't you do it! They are mine!

01:09:27.194 --> 01:09:29.162
- They are mine!
- Shut up!

01:09:29.163 --> 01:09:30.563
They are mine! They are mine!

01:09:30.564 --> 01:09:32.701
No more of this dog shit
in here either! Huh?

01:09:34.368 --> 01:09:36.536
Hey! Jenkin! Here!

01:09:36.537 --> 01:09:39.807
They are mine! They are mine!

01:09:39.809 --> 01:09:43.076
No more of that dog shit.
Is that clear?

01:09:43.078 --> 01:09:44.645
Ja, Captain.

01:09:51.286 --> 01:09:52.755
Hmm?

01:09:58.426 --> 01:10:00.326
I'll never understand why
you people surround yourself

01:10:00.328 --> 01:10:02.531
with these stupid
little pictures.

01:10:03.833 --> 01:10:07.300
And you missed a visit, I hear.
Is that right?

01:10:07.302 --> 01:10:09.837
Ja, Captain. Illness.

01:10:09.839 --> 01:10:13.573
Oh, so, that's what they
tell you?

01:10:13.575 --> 01:10:15.243
Hmm?

01:10:48.643 --> 01:10:50.278
What is this?

01:10:57.352 --> 01:10:58.587
It's...

01:11:00.221 --> 01:11:03.625
It's... it's... it's for...
um, photographs, Captain.

01:11:18.340 --> 01:11:20.776
What an utterly stupid idea.

01:11:24.814 --> 01:11:27.447
Yeah, you are quite the little
housewife, aren't you? Hey?

01:11:27.449 --> 01:11:29.117
Enough.

01:11:33.622 --> 01:11:35.156
There is something.

01:11:41.329 --> 01:11:43.531
There is something,
and I will find it.

01:11:46.736 --> 01:11:48.804
Now, you clean
all of that rubbish up.

01:11:52.908 --> 01:11:55.310
Huh? Another one?

01:11:56.311 --> 01:11:57.847
Alright, let's go.

01:12:14.462 --> 01:12:17.465
<i>I buried my nerves
as deep as I possibly could.</i>

01:12:20.468 --> 01:12:24.637
<i>But what stays in must come out.</i>

01:12:24.639 --> 01:12:27.240
<i>And the nightly panic attacks
grew more vicious</i>

01:12:27.242 --> 01:12:28.844
<i>as the days went on.</i>

01:12:33.715 --> 01:12:39.519
<i>And yet each obstacle presented
new ways of seeing things.</i>

01:12:39.521 --> 01:12:42.792
<i>So the entire prison
became a hiding ground.</i>

01:12:44.459 --> 01:12:45.928
<i>Bookcases.</i>

01:12:48.030 --> 01:12:51.264
<i>Cracks in the wall.</i>

01:12:51.266 --> 01:12:53.769
<i>Laundry buckets
filled with soap powder.</i>

01:12:55.570 --> 01:12:58.573
<i>These became agents of freedom.</i>

01:13:01.043 --> 01:13:04.410
<i>And when one door closed,</i>

01:13:04.412 --> 01:13:06.379
<i>another one opened.</i>

01:13:09.384 --> 01:13:11.921
<i>Many of them with keys
that I had made.</i>

01:13:23.833 --> 01:13:25.901
<i>Freedom is a very simple idea.</i>

01:13:27.635 --> 01:13:31.239
<i>Which is perhaps why
it can be so easily lost.</i>

01:13:38.848 --> 01:13:40.515
Right.

01:13:44.519 --> 01:13:45.953
There's some decay here.

01:13:45.955 --> 01:13:48.021
Arggh! It's when
you touch the back.

01:13:48.023 --> 01:13:50.860
He'll have to come to my
surgery. It needs to come out.

01:13:54.596 --> 01:13:56.732
Not again, dammit!

01:14:00.368 --> 01:14:01.904
Stay!

01:14:07.843 --> 01:14:10.778
Loggie! The electric door!

01:14:10.780 --> 01:14:14.114
We're standing here!

01:14:14.116 --> 01:14:17.853
Loggie! Open the grille door!
Push the button!

01:14:19.420 --> 01:14:22.890
Open the damn door!
Loggie! Wake up!

01:14:24.860 --> 01:14:26.661
Oh! Well done!

01:14:30.032 --> 01:14:31.699
Right.

01:14:33.501 --> 01:14:34.835
Move!

01:14:36.071 --> 01:14:38.406
Oh, shit! Get on your feet, man!

01:14:45.513 --> 01:14:48.882
Over the past several
months, we've created 39 keys

01:14:48.884 --> 01:14:51.752
for 15 separate doors
around this prison.

01:14:51.754 --> 01:14:54.554
We've moved from our cells
to the corridor

01:14:54.556 --> 01:14:56.957
to downstairs
and into the admin section

01:14:56.959 --> 01:14:59.960
404 days without detection.

01:14:59.962 --> 01:15:02.097
We want to share this with you.

01:15:03.498 --> 01:15:05.098
Why won't you come?

01:15:05.100 --> 01:15:07.533
You said it yourself. They're
building a gun tower outside.

01:15:07.535 --> 01:15:10.037
- It's not operational yet.
- You <i>think.</i>

01:15:10.039 --> 01:15:12.438
Listen, running around
fiddling with cupboards

01:15:12.440 --> 01:15:15.142
and surviving out there
are two very different things.

01:15:15.144 --> 01:15:17.110
We're not going with you
because there's nowhere to go.

01:15:17.112 --> 01:15:19.947
We can go to Mozambique
and from there to Tanzania.

01:15:19.949 --> 01:15:21.181
You're not listening to us.

01:15:21.183 --> 01:15:22.916
I've had enough
of listening to you.

01:15:22.918 --> 01:15:24.684
- Hey! You show some respect!
- Why?

01:15:24.686 --> 01:15:26.419
Alright, that's enough!
I suggest that from now...

01:15:26.421 --> 01:15:28.021
And you,
we all know your decision

01:15:28.023 --> 01:15:29.890
to fly your flag from behind
your prison bars.

01:15:29.892 --> 01:15:32.692
- We don't agree.
- We should turn and follow <i>you</i> now?

01:15:32.694 --> 01:15:34.962
- Follow your conscience.
- Are you my conscience?

01:15:34.964 --> 01:15:36.696
Yeah. If we have to be.

01:15:36.698 --> 01:15:38.732
Anything short of escape is
a pact with the devil himself.

01:15:38.734 --> 01:15:40.000
You know that!

01:15:40.002 --> 01:15:41.667
One by one,
this government is hacking

01:15:41.669 --> 01:15:42.903
everything we stand for
to pieces,

01:15:42.905 --> 01:15:44.738
and our inactivity
is complicity!

01:15:44.740 --> 01:15:47.040
Every day we sit here,
we justify this regime.

01:15:47.042 --> 01:15:50.610
But maybe all you white South
Africans are the same, huh?

01:15:50.612 --> 01:15:52.880
You're all talk. No action.

01:15:52.882 --> 01:15:55.082
Hey, alright! Alright!

01:15:55.084 --> 01:15:56.682
Disrespectful son of a bitch!

01:15:56.684 --> 01:15:57.985
Remember who
you're talking to, boy!

01:15:57.987 --> 01:15:59.719
I know exactly
who I'm talking to.

01:15:59.721 --> 01:16:01.654
- Oh, is that right?
- Yes, it is!

01:16:01.656 --> 01:16:05.058
No action? You tell that
bullshit to Mandela! Or Sisulu!

01:16:05.060 --> 01:16:08.996
Or any of us at Rivonia! We did
everything we could in '64!

01:16:08.998 --> 01:16:12.766
I for one am proud to stand by
my brothers on Robben Island!

01:16:12.768 --> 01:16:14.968
Arrested together,
sentenced together,

01:16:14.970 --> 01:16:17.237
and if we have to,
we will die together.

01:16:17.239 --> 01:16:19.006
This is bullshit!

01:16:19.008 --> 01:16:20.874
They would escape, all of them!

01:16:20.876 --> 01:16:24.144
Only they can't, because they don't
have this weapon, which we do.

01:16:24.146 --> 01:16:26.113
What we do have is our unity.

01:16:26.115 --> 01:16:28.148
As it is,
they will interrogate us,

01:16:28.150 --> 01:16:30.150
perhaps torture us for months,

01:16:30.152 --> 01:16:32.819
even years in here
because of you.

01:16:32.821 --> 01:16:34.187
So come with us.

01:16:34.189 --> 01:16:36.023
If you want to double
your sentence, go,

01:16:36.025 --> 01:16:38.025
but we are not coming with you,
not now.

01:16:38.027 --> 01:16:40.027
And don't you dare presume

01:16:40.029 --> 01:16:41.995
to come to my country
and tell me how things are!

01:16:41.997 --> 01:16:45.167
I've been in prison since before
you knew what apartheid was!

01:16:50.172 --> 01:16:52.505
I too have had to watch
my children grow up

01:16:52.507 --> 01:16:55.142
through that little
prison visitor window.

01:16:55.144 --> 01:16:59.012
I'm 15 years into
a four-life sentence.

01:16:59.014 --> 01:17:00.646
It doesn't get any easier.

01:17:00.648 --> 01:17:04.517
But a seed has to rot
in the ground

01:17:04.519 --> 01:17:07.788
before you can enjoy
the fruits of its tree.

01:17:07.790 --> 01:17:11.124
That is the price
we have to pay, all of us.

01:17:11.126 --> 01:17:14.061
- Rather than running away.
- We're not running away.

01:17:14.063 --> 01:17:17.166
- Then stay. Fight.
- This is how we fight.

01:17:18.533 --> 01:17:20.235
We can all go tonight.

01:17:21.270 --> 01:17:22.905
And when you're caught?

01:17:24.006 --> 01:17:25.808
When we're caught...

01:17:27.575 --> 01:17:29.943
you can come back
from the dead

01:17:29.945 --> 01:17:33.313
for those brothers
that you are talking about.

01:17:33.315 --> 01:17:35.483
But you won't do it.

01:17:37.286 --> 01:17:40.120
I think you'll look back
at this moment

01:17:40.122 --> 01:17:44.893
and you'll regret this decision
for the rest of your lives.

01:17:56.038 --> 01:17:58.273
Come on. We tried.

01:18:04.913 --> 01:18:06.514
Merry Christmas.

01:18:07.615 --> 01:18:09.218
And to you.

01:18:59.101 --> 01:19:00.836
In.

01:19:11.346 --> 01:19:13.015
Shit!

01:19:18.887 --> 01:19:20.320
I think it's too late

01:19:20.322 --> 01:19:22.723
to stop your vrot black teeth
falling out, huh?

01:19:25.394 --> 01:19:28.363
Or it's more kak to trade
with those black gorillas.

01:19:30.099 --> 01:19:32.132
Get them out! Now!

01:19:32.134 --> 01:19:34.269
Alright, Tooth Fairy. Out!

01:19:37.806 --> 01:19:39.808
Get out of my cell. Get out!

01:19:53.455 --> 01:19:55.224
Ridiculous!

01:19:56.758 --> 01:19:59.960
I'm wasting my time in here!
Boy, I promise you!

01:20:18.080 --> 01:20:19.948
Oh, thank God!

01:20:36.431 --> 01:20:38.100
Ah!

01:20:49.178 --> 01:20:51.013
Aha.

01:21:07.062 --> 01:21:08.931
Crying like a little girl.

01:21:59.281 --> 01:22:01.314
Good luck, you guys.

01:22:08.056 --> 01:22:09.925
It's not too late to come.

01:22:11.326 --> 01:22:14.830
Make damn sure you get clear.
You hear me?

01:22:56.071 --> 01:22:57.839
Come on, come on, come on.

01:23:28.937 --> 01:23:30.405
Mm-hm.

01:23:44.986 --> 01:23:47.120
Hmm.

01:23:47.122 --> 01:23:50.392
How can they
find anything in here?

01:24:35.670 --> 01:24:39.541
Wait.

01:25:22.451 --> 01:25:24.250
What's this?

01:25:29.658 --> 01:25:31.460
Go. Go, go. Go.

01:25:32.795 --> 01:25:34.661
Where's the paperclip?
The paperclip?

01:25:34.663 --> 01:25:36.663
- Where is it?
- It must be here.

01:25:36.665 --> 01:25:39.000
Just bloody pull it!

01:26:22.611 --> 01:26:26.112
Meneer! Meneer! I'm calling you!

01:26:26.114 --> 01:26:28.181
Meneer! Meneer!

01:26:29.417 --> 01:26:31.217
Meneer!

01:26:31.219 --> 01:26:34.287
Meneer! Meneer!

01:26:45.600 --> 01:26:48.738
Alright, alright! Enough!

01:27:54.870 --> 01:27:56.269
- Stop.
- What?

01:27:56.271 --> 01:27:58.404
I need to go back.
I need to go back.

01:27:58.406 --> 01:27:59.873
- Why?
- For the buzzer.

01:27:59.875 --> 01:28:02.277
The buzzer for
the electric door.

01:28:09.651 --> 01:28:11.319
Nice.

01:28:16.257 --> 01:28:17.559
Yes!

01:28:19.594 --> 01:28:21.229
Come on!

01:28:26.201 --> 01:28:27.567
Come on, come on, come, come.

01:28:27.569 --> 01:28:28.769
Alright.

01:28:28.771 --> 01:28:30.572
Come on, come on, come on.

01:28:36.378 --> 01:28:38.546
OK. Go.

01:28:42.985 --> 01:28:45.387
OK. Workshop key.

01:28:48.991 --> 01:28:50.456
Round tip.

01:28:50.458 --> 01:28:52.926
Just the workshop key.

01:28:52.928 --> 01:28:54.828
Visitor's room.
It's a round tip.

01:28:54.830 --> 01:28:56.496
No, it's not. That's not
what we need right now.

01:28:56.498 --> 01:29:00.368
- It's a round tip.
- Guys! Just try them both.

01:29:08.844 --> 01:29:10.410
No.

01:29:10.412 --> 01:29:11.713
See?

01:29:13.715 --> 01:29:14.884
Thank you.

01:29:20.555 --> 01:29:21.924
It's OK. Go on, go on, go on.

01:29:27.429 --> 01:29:28.864
Get out the way.

01:29:32.902 --> 01:29:35.470
Ah!

01:29:38.673 --> 01:29:40.673
Come on, come on. Come, come.

01:29:40.675 --> 01:29:43.879
You have to push it
all the way in, mon ami.

01:30:01.362 --> 01:30:02.730
The gates are wide open.

01:30:02.732 --> 01:30:04.767
You can see the street.

01:30:06.468 --> 01:30:08.236
Oh, we made it.

01:30:12.607 --> 01:30:14.242
My God.

01:30:18.480 --> 01:30:20.615
I'll never forget this moment.

01:30:25.653 --> 01:30:28.623
- OK.
- OK. OK.

01:30:36.832 --> 01:30:38.500
OK. Next.

01:30:51.981 --> 01:30:53.648
Next.

01:30:58.586 --> 01:31:00.055
Next.

01:31:01.623 --> 01:31:03.090
- You push it all the way in?
- Yes!

01:31:03.092 --> 01:31:04.825
Yes, I'm pushing it
all the way in.

01:31:04.827 --> 01:31:06.626
Just give me another one.

01:31:06.628 --> 01:31:08.296
I'm out.

01:31:09.865 --> 01:31:11.834
That's the last one we have.

01:31:31.486 --> 01:31:34.755
- What are we going to do?
- Well... we have to go back.

01:31:34.757 --> 01:31:36.622
Back? I'd rather be shot.

01:31:36.624 --> 01:31:38.091
Well, we don't have
any other choice!

01:31:38.093 --> 01:31:40.528
Hey, guys, just wait. OK, wait.

01:31:50.039 --> 01:31:51.740
Ja, maybe.

01:31:54.810 --> 01:31:56.509
- What?
- Chisel.

01:31:56.511 --> 01:31:58.580
What's going on?
What are you doing?

01:31:59.514 --> 01:32:00.881
No!

01:32:00.883 --> 01:32:03.851
No! No! Stop! Stop!

01:32:03.853 --> 01:32:05.418
Leonard!

01:32:05.420 --> 01:32:07.089
This is gonna get us caught!

01:32:08.489 --> 01:32:10.656
And they're gonna know
that we did it!

01:32:10.658 --> 01:32:13.062
Screwdriver.
I need to get in deeper.

01:32:24.706 --> 01:32:26.073
You can hear it
in the bloody corridor!

01:32:26.075 --> 01:32:27.808
Time to have a look.

01:32:27.810 --> 01:32:30.712
See? It's coming.

01:32:33.015 --> 01:32:34.682
It's getting close.

01:32:36.852 --> 01:32:39.452
Ja. OK, ja.
Give me the screwdriver.

01:32:39.454 --> 01:32:40.923
Come on, keep going.

01:33:03.145 --> 01:33:04.813
Hold. Hold. Hold.

01:33:14.823 --> 01:33:18.593
Alright, alright.
That's enough. That's enough.

01:33:26.201 --> 01:33:27.801
Voilà.

01:33:27.803 --> 01:33:29.604
OK. Let's go.

01:33:40.816 --> 01:33:42.215
OK?

01:33:42.217 --> 01:33:45.118
- Ja, ja.
- OK.

01:33:45.120 --> 01:33:46.956
OK. No, no, no. Wait, wait.

01:33:52.227 --> 01:33:54.063
What...?

01:33:57.632 --> 01:33:59.532
OK. Let's go.

01:33:59.534 --> 01:34:01.034
OK. Guys, I just want
to tell you, there's no...

01:34:01.036 --> 01:34:03.772
Tim, just open the damn door!

01:34:21.323 --> 01:34:23.225
No! No! Wait! No!

01:34:29.164 --> 01:34:30.833
Right.

01:34:31.800 --> 01:34:34.134
See?

01:34:34.136 --> 01:34:35.804
- Oh, man.
- Let me see.

01:34:43.112 --> 01:34:44.847
OK, he's going...

01:34:47.049 --> 01:34:48.683
he's going...

01:34:50.152 --> 01:34:51.887
Go. Go. Go.

01:35:13.742 --> 01:35:16.078
The map. Give me the map.

01:35:26.755 --> 01:35:28.290
Go.

01:35:36.365 --> 01:35:38.300
Go. Go.

01:36:45.300 --> 01:36:47.635
- Alright. Alright.
- Go. Come on.

01:37:09.491 --> 01:37:12.058
Uh... three to Joburg.

01:37:12.060 --> 01:37:13.962
The white rank is that way.

01:37:16.365 --> 01:37:18.867
No. Uh, this... this rank
is fine.

01:37:25.107 --> 01:37:26.740
No, that's fine.

01:37:26.742 --> 01:37:29.111
Come on, come on, come on.

01:37:33.782 --> 01:37:35.117
OK.

01:37:40.022 --> 01:37:41.988
The lock's not working anymore.

01:37:41.990 --> 01:37:43.890
Ja. Tell me about it.

01:37:43.892 --> 01:37:45.825
Come on.

01:37:45.827 --> 01:37:47.994
Get in. Get in.

01:38:00.309 --> 01:38:02.275
Rise and shine, ladies!

01:38:04.780 --> 01:38:06.714
Up you get, girls!

01:38:22.898 --> 01:38:25.734
- Good morning, Grandad.
- Good morning, meneer.

01:38:29.271 --> 01:38:31.306
- Up!
- Good morning, meneer.

01:38:40.215 --> 01:38:41.850
Meneer?

01:39:00.102 --> 01:39:02.269
Hey! Get up!

01:39:02.271 --> 01:39:03.939
Hey!

01:39:06.608 --> 01:39:09.144
Oh, shit! Oh, shit!

01:39:18.520 --> 01:39:20.420
No...

01:39:20.422 --> 01:39:21.921
No.

01:39:21.923 --> 01:39:24.192
Sound the alarm.
Sound the alarm!

01:39:42.477 --> 01:39:44.177
Oh, my...

01:39:44.179 --> 01:39:45.979

01:39:45.981 --> 01:39:47.514
We did.
