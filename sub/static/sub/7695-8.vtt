WEBVTT

00:07.258 --> 00:10.261
Yes, Donnie,
I'll take out the garbage.

00:11.722 --> 00:13.894
No, Donnie, I won't
experiment on

00:13.894 --> 00:16.807
the kids' bionics
while they're asleep again.

00:16.807 --> 00:19.690
It was one time,
and you didn't even notice.

00:19.690 --> 00:21.692
Gotta go.

00:21.692 --> 00:24.355
Yes.

00:24.355 --> 00:25.946
I miss you, too.

00:27.908 --> 00:30.111
Donnie and the students
made it to Gettysburg

00:30.111 --> 00:31.742
for their first
official field trip.

00:31.742 --> 00:34.285
Bionic kids
and cannonballs.

00:34.285 --> 00:35.866
What could possibly
go wrong?

00:35.866 --> 00:38.369
You're his student.
Why didn't you go?

00:38.369 --> 00:40.501
Big D. thinks I'm there.

00:40.501 --> 00:42.873
When he takes attendance,
I paid a kid five bucks
to yell, "Here,"

00:42.873 --> 00:44.665
and another kid ten bucks
to yell, "Shut it, Leo."

00:47.128 --> 00:49.130
Oh, hey, Bree.

00:49.130 --> 00:51.512
I ditched the field trip
so I could hang out
with you guys.

00:51.512 --> 00:52.933
What should we do
on our day off?

00:52.933 --> 00:54.675
Our day off?

00:54.675 --> 00:56.767
No, this is
my day off,

00:56.767 --> 00:58.389
and I've already
got it all planned out.

00:58.389 --> 00:59.980
I'm gonna sit by the pool
and read a book.

00:59.980 --> 01:01.602
I'd ask you
to join me,

01:01.602 --> 01:03.734
but I live and work
with my family,

01:03.734 --> 01:05.065
so I'm sick
of all of you.

01:06.987 --> 01:08.859
Hey, Chase,
wanna hang out?

01:08.859 --> 01:11.452
Sorry, Leo, gotta make
the most of my day off.

01:11.452 --> 01:13.194
I already organized
the weapons vault,

01:13.194 --> 01:15.196
alkalized the island's
water system,

01:15.196 --> 01:17.328
and taught a cute little
group of dolphins

01:17.328 --> 01:20.000
to wave hello.

01:20.000 --> 01:21.832
Next up,
some light reading.

01:21.832 --> 01:23.794
Oh.

01:27.418 --> 01:29.630
She ended up marrying
the vampire?

01:29.630 --> 01:31.552
I did not
see that coming.

01:33.214 --> 01:35.346
- Hey, Adam.
- No.

01:36.637 --> 01:38.849
I didn't even
ask you anything yet.

01:38.849 --> 01:40.221
Oh, I'm sorry.
go ahead.

01:40.221 --> 01:41.812
- Thank you.
Would you like to--
- No.

01:41.812 --> 01:45.226
Guys, check out this rock
I found on shore.

01:45.226 --> 01:47.398
I had to dig it out
from under a wooden box

01:47.398 --> 01:49.650
of old yellow coins
and jewelry.

01:51.442 --> 01:53.194
Adam, this isn't
a rock.

01:53.194 --> 01:54.535
It's a fossil.

01:54.535 --> 01:56.617
- Let me see that.
- No!

02:09.750 --> 02:11.842
This is a prehistoric
sea spider.

02:11.842 --> 02:14.715
It went extinct
millions of years ago.

02:14.715 --> 02:17.558
Way to go, Chase.
You made my rock boring.

02:19.139 --> 02:21.642
Cool. I love spiders.

02:21.642 --> 02:25.266
Back in high school,
they used to call me
Spider Legs.

02:26.567 --> 02:29.650
And now, I'm realizing
that's a bad thing.

02:29.650 --> 02:32.823
It looks like it's from
the Cretaceous period.

02:32.823 --> 02:34.275
You're right, Douglas.

02:34.275 --> 02:37.077
It's from the Valanginian
subdivision.

02:37.077 --> 02:39.910
I would've loved
to have seen this spider
when it was alive.

02:39.910 --> 02:41.702
Maybe you can.

02:41.702 --> 02:45.666
Before I got into bionics,
I dabbled in biology.

02:45.666 --> 02:48.459
I was trying to use fossils
to bring extinct species

02:48.459 --> 02:50.631
back to life.

02:50.631 --> 02:54.425
And that explains why
there's still no
Mrs. Douglas Davenport.

02:55.926 --> 02:59.680
This specimen is
almost perfectly preserved.

02:59.680 --> 03:01.682
I was never able
to crack it on my own,

03:01.682 --> 03:03.474
but maybe with your help,
I can.

03:03.474 --> 03:05.766
I'm pretty sure
you're not looking at me,

03:05.766 --> 03:07.147
but I am in.

03:07.147 --> 03:08.729
Let's do this, Douglas.

03:08.729 --> 03:10.361
[ringing bike bell]

03:10.361 --> 03:12.773
Hey, Leo, it was rude of me
to just say no

03:12.773 --> 03:14.865
when you asked if I wanted
to do something earlier.

03:14.865 --> 03:17.117
It's nice to see
you've come to your senses.

03:17.117 --> 03:19.280
What I should've said
was "no, thank you."

03:19.280 --> 03:20.741
[honks horn]

03:22.703 --> 03:25.956
The world's first
bionic superhumans...

03:25.956 --> 03:27.748
they're stronger than us.

03:27.748 --> 03:29.380
Faster.

03:29.380 --> 03:30.791
Smarter.

03:30.791 --> 03:32.883
The next generation
of the human race is...

03:32.883 --> 03:34.795
living on a bionic island.

04:13.003 --> 04:14.755
Almost there.

04:14.755 --> 04:16.507
Got it.

04:16.507 --> 04:18.969
Oh, you guys
started without me.

04:18.969 --> 04:20.971
I must've missed
the memo.

04:20.971 --> 04:22.723
Where we at,
compadres?

04:22.723 --> 04:26.307
First we have to extract
a sampling of its DNA

04:26.307 --> 04:29.189
Oh, great, then we can
map out its genetic structure,

04:29.189 --> 04:30.521
and recreate it
exactly.

04:30.521 --> 04:32.102
Or make it better.

04:32.102 --> 04:34.194
There's a reason
this spider went extinct.

04:34.194 --> 04:35.656
This time, we can give it
a better shot at survival.

04:35.656 --> 04:38.028
After all these years
of killing things,

04:38.028 --> 04:40.821
I can finally
help something live.

04:40.821 --> 04:42.403
Uh, what'd you
have in mind?

04:42.403 --> 04:43.824
Elongating its chelicera?

04:43.824 --> 04:46.747
Elongating the who
to the what now?

04:46.747 --> 04:49.620
Maybe we can increase
the strength of its carapace.

04:49.620 --> 04:51.412
Oh, good idea.

04:51.412 --> 04:53.374
To do that,
we'd have to alter

04:53.374 --> 04:55.586
- the dimensions of
its trochanter.
- Mm, bad idea.

04:55.586 --> 04:57.628
Right. To properly
distribute the weight--

04:57.628 --> 04:59.009
Yes, the weight.

04:59.009 --> 05:00.801
Of its altered
exoskeleton.

05:00.801 --> 05:02.633
The exoskeleton.
Of course.

05:02.633 --> 05:05.596
You're just repeating
everything we say.

05:05.596 --> 05:08.138
No, I'm testing you to see
if you're both listening,

05:08.138 --> 05:09.980
and you are.

05:09.980 --> 05:13.564
Now can we please get back
to our tree panthers

05:13.564 --> 05:15.566
and our carrot pizzas?

05:16.897 --> 05:19.029
Leo, look.

05:19.029 --> 05:20.651
You're a great tech guy,

05:20.651 --> 05:23.534
but this is more
of a biology thing.

05:24.705 --> 05:26.657
Are you icing me out?

05:26.657 --> 05:29.249
Finally. Something
you do understand.

05:38.959 --> 05:40.340
Watch it.

05:40.340 --> 05:42.052
Sorry. It's kinda
hard to see

05:42.052 --> 05:43.804
with all this
snorkeling gear on.

05:43.804 --> 05:45.806
Then take it off.

05:45.806 --> 05:48.559
Then how will I breathe?

05:48.559 --> 05:52.312
You have the bionic ability
to breathe underwater.

05:53.734 --> 05:55.976
But I'm not underwater.

05:55.976 --> 05:58.569
Why are you here?

05:58.569 --> 06:00.571
We have the whole island
to ourselves.

06:00.571 --> 06:02.653
Can't you see I am
trying to relax?

06:02.653 --> 06:04.785
Hey, I live here, too.

06:04.785 --> 06:06.827
Did it ever occur to you that
you sitting here reading quietly

06:06.827 --> 06:08.248
might be annoying to me?

06:08.248 --> 06:11.041
- No.
- Well, it is!

06:19.379 --> 06:23.464
[buzzing]

06:26.847 --> 06:28.929
Adam, what are you doing?

06:28.929 --> 06:32.392
What does it look like?
I'm shaving my knees.

06:32.392 --> 06:34.935
Why would you
shave your knees?

06:34.935 --> 06:36.937
'Cause it's
my day off.

06:40.400 --> 06:43.233
Guys, you've gotta
come downstairs and see this.

06:43.233 --> 06:45.446
Come on.

06:45.446 --> 06:47.698
Congratulations, Adam.
You did the impossible.

06:47.698 --> 06:49.450
You made me wanna
hang out with Chase.

06:54.455 --> 06:57.127
Behold, one of
the greatest achievements

06:57.127 --> 06:59.630
in the history
of science.

07:00.751 --> 07:03.003
[shrieks]
Spider! I'll get it!

07:05.636 --> 07:08.759
Stop. Douglas and I
were able to extract

07:08.759 --> 07:10.551
the DNA from the fossil,

07:10.551 --> 07:12.553
and reanimate
the sea spider.

07:12.553 --> 07:14.475
So you brought
a million-year-old creature

07:14.475 --> 07:15.726
back to life
in one day?

07:15.726 --> 07:18.519
What'd you do with
your day off?

07:19.560 --> 07:21.562
When you take
a lot of shortcuts,

07:21.562 --> 07:23.023
and conduct dangerous
experiments

07:23.023 --> 07:25.275
without any safety
precautions,

07:25.275 --> 07:27.277
you can do anything
in a day.

07:27.277 --> 07:28.989
Can you believe it?

07:28.989 --> 07:31.411
That you'd spend
your whole day off

07:31.411 --> 07:33.453
with your weird uncle,
playing with a dead spider?

07:33.453 --> 07:35.626
Yeah, I believe it.

07:35.626 --> 07:37.998
This is just
the beginning.

07:37.998 --> 07:41.461
Think of all the other
extinct animals we can
bring back to life.

07:41.461 --> 07:43.213
Dinosaurs.
Ooh, dodo birds.

07:43.213 --> 07:46.046
Camels.

07:46.046 --> 07:48.048
Adam, camels aren't extinct.

07:48.048 --> 07:51.852
Oh, yeah? Then how come
I've never seen one?

07:53.143 --> 07:56.476
That thing is nasty.

07:56.476 --> 07:59.520
Can I touch it?

07:59.520 --> 08:02.102
- No.
- Oh, but you guys
can touch it?

08:02.102 --> 08:05.696
Look, we can't risk
anything happening to it.

08:05.696 --> 08:07.908
This spider's very existence
could change everything.

08:07.908 --> 08:10.951
And make me famous
around the world.

08:10.951 --> 08:15.075
- And what about me?
- I'm sure you'll end up
on somebody's blog.

08:16.537 --> 08:18.418
There.

08:20.791 --> 08:22.833
That should keep
our little friend safe.

08:22.833 --> 08:25.546
Well, I'm gonna go
somewhere quiet

08:25.546 --> 08:27.387
and enjoy my day off.

08:27.387 --> 08:29.630
I'm gonna go
somewhere quiet
and make noise.

08:29.630 --> 08:31.632
Stop following me!

08:31.632 --> 08:33.303
Stop walking
in front of me!

08:33.303 --> 08:36.807
- Where you guys going?
- To the mainland.

08:36.807 --> 08:39.438
We still have to pick up
a few things for its terrarium.

08:39.438 --> 08:41.812
Mind if I...

08:41.812 --> 08:43.644
...join you?

08:45.065 --> 08:47.107
If you guys
are gonna blow me off,

08:47.107 --> 08:49.109
then I'm gonna play with
my new pal Spidey.

08:52.823 --> 08:55.786
Oh, great.
I forgot they locked it.

08:55.786 --> 08:58.749
Good thing I have
the spare key.

09:02.542 --> 09:04.004
Well, hello there.

09:04.004 --> 09:05.876
Oh, mmm.

09:11.381 --> 09:14.434
Anything that smells that bad
deserves to be extinct.

09:28.448 --> 09:30.030
Hey, Leo,
I have a question.

09:30.030 --> 09:31.612
- What's up?
- Is this annoying?

09:31.612 --> 09:33.193
[air horn blares]

09:34.995 --> 09:36.617
Yes, it's annoying.

09:36.617 --> 09:38.198
I'll tell you
what's annoying.

09:38.198 --> 09:40.661
People who interrupt
conversations.

09:40.661 --> 09:43.203
- Leo.
- [air horn blares]

09:44.795 --> 09:46.376
Let me hear it
one more time.

09:46.376 --> 09:47.878
[air horn blares]

09:47.878 --> 09:50.170
Yeah, that's annoying.

09:50.170 --> 09:52.713
We might have a problem,

09:52.713 --> 09:54.765
'cause this thing,
it's like candy to my ears.

09:54.765 --> 09:57.638
[blares]

09:57.638 --> 10:00.771
Adam, why do you
keep pestering me?

10:00.771 --> 10:02.312
I'm not pestering you.

10:02.312 --> 10:04.224
I'm just trying to relax
on my day off.

10:04.224 --> 10:05.856
This is my Zen.

10:05.856 --> 10:08.649
[blares]

10:08.649 --> 10:09.940
That's it.

10:15.495 --> 10:18.448
Try to toot
your little horn now.

10:18.448 --> 10:22.162
[air horn blows
weakly]

10:22.162 --> 10:24.745
You messed with
our spider.

10:24.745 --> 10:27.297
You can't bring
an extinct spider

10:27.297 --> 10:29.840
back to life and expect me
not to play with it.

10:31.672 --> 10:33.173
Besides,
what's the big deal?

10:33.173 --> 10:34.885
The big deal is,

10:34.885 --> 10:37.808
you didn't put
the cover on right,
and it escaped.

10:37.808 --> 10:39.890
Oh.

10:39.890 --> 10:42.312
Well, that is
a big deal.

10:43.523 --> 10:45.816
[Adam screaming]

10:45.816 --> 10:48.068
You okay?

10:48.068 --> 10:49.980
I don't know.
Something bit me in the back

10:49.980 --> 10:51.191
when I was
in the pool.

10:51.191 --> 10:53.613
That's called karma.

10:53.613 --> 10:55.615
No, I bet it was
the spider.

10:55.615 --> 10:58.278
Well, if it was,
it's gone.

10:58.278 --> 11:00.160
It really hurts.
How's it look?

11:00.160 --> 11:02.162
[all shrieking]

11:03.704 --> 11:05.545
I better
scan the wound.

11:10.961 --> 11:15.966
Guys, his spider bite
shows lethal levels of poison.

11:17.387 --> 11:18.759
What? Is it bad?

11:18.759 --> 11:20.891
Uh, no.

11:20.891 --> 11:23.563
Just stay calm,

11:23.563 --> 11:25.685
and think of
your happy place.

11:26.727 --> 11:29.069
Better yet...

11:29.069 --> 11:31.521
[blares]

11:31.521 --> 11:33.573
Ahh!

11:40.280 --> 11:42.242
His vitals
are dropping by the minute.

11:42.242 --> 11:43.874
He's burning up.

11:43.874 --> 11:46.706
I cannot believe
this is all because
of a spider bite.

11:46.706 --> 11:48.708
If we don't do
something soon, he's gonna...

11:52.292 --> 11:54.594
Chase. Chase.

11:54.594 --> 11:56.046
Where's Chase?

11:56.046 --> 11:58.889
I'm here, Adam.

11:58.889 --> 12:00.971
Take my hand.

12:00.971 --> 12:04.264
There's something
I have to tell you.

12:05.395 --> 12:06.937
If I die--

12:06.937 --> 12:08.558
I'm not gonna
let that happen.

12:08.558 --> 12:10.400
No, listen to me.

12:10.400 --> 12:12.983
If I die,
I want you to know...

12:14.945 --> 12:16.616
even when I'm dead...

12:16.616 --> 12:18.028
Adam...

12:18.028 --> 12:20.160
I'm just a pile of bones...

12:23.784 --> 12:26.036
I'll still be
taller than you.

12:29.960 --> 12:32.002
You should've seen
the look on your faces.

12:33.333 --> 12:36.586
Wait. Why do you have
so many tiny faces?

12:38.969 --> 12:41.972
Oh, no. The venom
must be making him hallucinate.

12:41.972 --> 12:45.765
I love what you've done
to your hair, Bree.

12:47.477 --> 12:49.559
I never would've
brought that spider back,

12:49.559 --> 12:51.191
had I known that
it was poisonous.

12:51.191 --> 12:52.983
Why didn't you know
it was poisonous?

12:52.983 --> 12:54.815
Why didn't you know
it was poisonous?

12:54.815 --> 12:56.316
You're the fossil expert.

12:56.316 --> 12:58.448
You're supposed to be
the smartest man in the world.

12:58.448 --> 12:59.699
Hey, stop.

12:59.699 --> 13:02.032
Blaming each other
is not gonna help Adam.

13:02.032 --> 13:03.994
Besides, I'm the one
who pushed him in the pool.

13:03.994 --> 13:05.665
Oh, so it's your fault.

13:05.665 --> 13:07.537
She admitted it.

13:07.537 --> 13:08.869
Well, he let
the spider out.

13:08.869 --> 13:10.710
Hey, I'm not even
here right now.

13:10.710 --> 13:11.711
I'm in Gettysburg.

13:13.713 --> 13:15.125
We have to find
that spider.

13:15.125 --> 13:16.756
If we can make
an antidote

13:16.756 --> 13:18.418
by extracting
the venom from its sac,

13:18.418 --> 13:19.679
it should reverse
the effects.

13:19.679 --> 13:22.552
- [groaning]
- Don't worry, Adam.

13:22.552 --> 13:24.554
We're gonna find that spider
and save you, I promise.

13:24.554 --> 13:27.347
Okey-dokey,
Mr. Corn Dog.

13:30.060 --> 13:32.482
Oh, don't be afraid.

13:32.482 --> 13:34.935
I just wanna bite
your head off.

13:36.106 --> 13:38.108
Okay, come on.

13:45.535 --> 13:47.707
Now the spider
is really dangerous,

13:47.707 --> 13:50.040
so we have to be
very careful that
we don't get bitten.

13:50.040 --> 13:51.621
Right.

13:54.414 --> 13:56.046
What are you doing?!

13:57.627 --> 14:00.630
Protecting you?

14:00.630 --> 14:03.763
Oh, come on,
I'm the bigger loss,
and we both know it.

14:06.016 --> 14:09.309
You are bionic,
and you're afraid of a spider?

14:09.309 --> 14:10.971
Of course not.

14:10.971 --> 14:13.853
I made it.
I'm not afraid of it.

14:15.735 --> 14:18.398
Get it off me,
get it off me!

14:21.741 --> 14:24.484
Here, spider,
spider, spider.

14:24.484 --> 14:26.576
What are you doing?
It's not a dog.

14:26.576 --> 14:28.288
They both bite,
don't they?

14:29.829 --> 14:31.701
Here, spider,
spider, spider.

14:39.339 --> 14:41.501
- Did you find it?
- No. Did you?

14:41.501 --> 14:44.844
Why would I ask
if you found it
if I found it?

14:44.844 --> 14:47.137
- I was being polite.
- At a time like this?

14:47.137 --> 14:49.309
There is never
a bad time for good manners.

14:51.511 --> 14:53.723
- Did you find it?
- No. Did you?

14:53.723 --> 14:55.145
See?

14:55.145 --> 14:58.648
No, we did not,
but thank you for asking.

14:59.729 --> 15:02.692
Okay, the spider could not
have just disappeared.

15:02.692 --> 15:04.824
[loud crashing]

15:04.824 --> 15:06.366
Wait. What was that?

15:06.366 --> 15:08.488
I think it's coming
from outside.

15:09.739 --> 15:11.291
Is that...

15:13.623 --> 15:16.706
I think we just
found the spider.

15:19.629 --> 15:20.961
[ferocious roaring]

15:20.961 --> 15:22.462
[shrieking]

15:25.045 --> 15:27.177
That spider did not
look like that this morning.

15:27.177 --> 15:28.848
What happened?

15:28.848 --> 15:30.850
- I don't know.
- Why is it so big?

15:30.850 --> 15:32.392
- I don't know.
- Why don't you know?

15:32.392 --> 15:34.054
I don't know!!

15:37.817 --> 15:39.439
Douglas.

15:41.561 --> 15:43.563
Okay, fine.

15:44.654 --> 15:46.616
Remember how...

15:46.616 --> 15:49.029
you wanted to make
the spider more resilient

15:49.029 --> 15:51.281
so that it wouldn't
go extinct again?

15:51.281 --> 15:53.743
I remember you wanted
to do that.

15:55.875 --> 15:58.788
And, uh, we talked about
giving it growth hormones.

15:58.788 --> 16:01.791
And I said, do not do that.

16:01.791 --> 16:05.045
Which could be interpreted
many different ways.

16:05.045 --> 16:06.296
[groans]

16:06.296 --> 16:08.758
I didn't know
it would get this big.

16:08.758 --> 16:10.760
Oh, yeah.

16:10.760 --> 16:13.683
Who knew that growth hormones
would make something grow?

16:13.683 --> 16:16.806
You're just mad 'cause
I didn't save any for you.

16:16.806 --> 16:18.728
[both] Ooh!

16:18.728 --> 16:20.150
Below the belt, Douglas.

16:20.150 --> 16:22.152
Below the belt.

16:22.152 --> 16:26.276
Guys, there is no need
to kill each other.

16:26.276 --> 16:27.947
Although, that was
a good one, Uncle Dougie.

16:31.661 --> 16:33.663
If we don't
stop that thing,

16:33.663 --> 16:35.375
it's gonna destroy
the entire academy.

16:35.375 --> 16:37.167
No, wait.
We can't kill it yet.

16:37.167 --> 16:39.119
The venom's no good
to Adam if we extract it

16:39.119 --> 16:40.620
when the spider's dead.

16:40.620 --> 16:42.882
Great. Now we just
need to find someone

16:42.882 --> 16:44.674
who knows how to milk
a 50-foot spider.

16:44.674 --> 16:47.927
No, no, we don't
have to milk it.

16:47.927 --> 16:50.300
We have to extract
the spider's venom with this.

16:50.300 --> 16:52.512
This should be
sharp enough

16:52.512 --> 16:54.684
to puncture
the venom sac.

16:54.684 --> 16:57.477
Check the security feed
to see if it's still out there.

16:59.899 --> 17:01.691
It's by
the living quarters.

17:01.691 --> 17:03.693
- Great. Let's go.
- Remember, we have to get

17:03.693 --> 17:05.815
as close as we can to make sure
we get a good shot.

17:05.815 --> 17:10.319
So you want us to sidle up
next to a giant, angry,
deadly spider

17:10.319 --> 17:13.782
- and poke it with a needle.
- Yep.

17:13.782 --> 17:16.035
And if we can do it
before my brother returns,

17:16.035 --> 17:17.577
that would be great.

17:27.967 --> 17:29.379
Why is it trying
to attack us?

17:29.379 --> 17:30.840
It's not.

17:30.840 --> 17:32.632
It's trying to eat us.

17:32.632 --> 17:34.634
Why is it trying
to eat us?

17:34.634 --> 17:38.978
Because we forgot to bring
back its food source.

17:38.978 --> 17:41.941
"We"? Oh, no.
There is no we.

17:41.941 --> 17:45.605
This is all you.
You are a terrible scientist.

17:45.605 --> 17:49.779
Hey, I'm not the one
who let the spider out.

17:49.779 --> 17:54.154
You are the one who made it
a 50-foot-tall man-eater.

17:55.745 --> 17:58.828
Chase. Chase.
Where's Chase?

17:58.828 --> 18:00.580
Oh, knock it off!

18:09.419 --> 18:11.341
Okay.

18:12.472 --> 18:14.053
All right.

18:15.635 --> 18:17.717
Ha!

18:17.717 --> 18:19.309
Leo, what are you doing?

18:19.309 --> 18:20.810
Saving the day.

18:20.810 --> 18:22.682
You know,
do my Leo thing.

18:24.103 --> 18:25.645
Not like that,
you aren't.

18:25.645 --> 18:26.986
Your angle's all off.

18:30.860 --> 18:32.612
Now that's karma.

18:32.612 --> 18:34.694
Stop. Douglas was right.

18:34.694 --> 18:37.116
Your angle
is completely off.

18:37.116 --> 18:39.869
I am not giving
the harpoon to somebody
who started all this.

18:39.869 --> 18:43.453
Again, you started
all of this.

18:43.453 --> 18:45.795
And I'm about
to end it.

18:49.088 --> 18:52.051
You know, suddenly,
I feel sorry for the spider.

19:03.563 --> 19:05.395
Here goes.

19:13.653 --> 19:15.405
Got it.

19:20.990 --> 19:22.782
Perfect.

19:22.782 --> 19:25.285
This should be
more than enough venom.

19:25.285 --> 19:26.666
Ya think?

19:31.421 --> 19:34.504
Well, let's go make
that antidote.

19:36.386 --> 19:38.888
Hey, Bree,
you need a towel?

19:38.888 --> 19:40.720
No, it's okay.

19:40.720 --> 19:42.892
I'd rather just stand here
covered in spider goo.

19:42.892 --> 19:45.515
And it went in
my mouth. Okay.

19:49.689 --> 19:51.771
You see, this is
what I'm talking about.

19:51.771 --> 19:53.653
A little family bonding.

19:53.653 --> 19:56.986
Funny how it takes
a giant killer spider

19:56.986 --> 20:00.490
going after our loved ones
to remind you what's
really important.

20:00.490 --> 20:04.784
Sitting around with
the people you see every day.

20:04.784 --> 20:07.206
Too bad we had to destroy
Spidey.

20:07.206 --> 20:08.878
I'm gonna miss him.

20:08.878 --> 20:11.421
On the bright side,
we're the only people

20:11.421 --> 20:13.593
to make a species
extinct twice.

20:16.796 --> 20:18.758
Adam, you look great.

20:18.758 --> 20:22.101
Thanks. You look like
you always do.

20:23.433 --> 20:26.436
Wow, that antidote
worked quickly.

20:26.436 --> 20:29.809
Then why does he still have
a giant boil on his back?

20:34.614 --> 20:37.657
It's just excess fluid.

20:37.657 --> 20:39.158
Should be gone
in a few days.

20:39.158 --> 20:40.910
Or I can just
pop it right now.

20:47.166 --> 20:49.669
I feel better already.

20:49.669 --> 20:53.132
So do I.

20:53.132 --> 20:55.835
And it went in my mouth.

21:04.724 --> 21:07.727
Hey, guys, check out
this funny-looking egg

21:07.727 --> 21:09.309
that washed up
on shore.

21:09.309 --> 21:12.732
- That's a dinosaur egg.
- Oh, boy.

21:12.732 --> 21:16.025
You know, this time,
if we don't give it
growth hormones,

21:16.025 --> 21:18.448
- we could...
- Or...

21:24.203 --> 21:26.285
...you can get a new hobby.

21:28.748 --> 21:30.960
If you need me,

21:30.960 --> 21:33.623
I'll be in Gettysburg.
