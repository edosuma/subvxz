WEBVTT

00:01.817 --> 00:04.051
[Crow caws]

00:04.053 --> 00:06.906
Frankie: Out here in the middle,
if you go out of town,

00:06.907 --> 00:08.314
your neighbors look out for you.

00:08.315 --> 00:10.218
They'll bring in your mail,
water your plants,

00:10.219 --> 00:11.874
and sometimes they even take care

00:11.875 --> 00:13.986
of your dead aunt's emphysemic old dog.

00:13.987 --> 00:16.437
Oh, she was no problem at all.

00:16.438 --> 00:17.484
Oh, wow!

00:17.485 --> 00:19.539
Where's the wagon? And the oxygen tank?

00:19.540 --> 00:20.597
You know what?

00:20.598 --> 00:22.756
After a few days, she just perked right up.

00:22.757 --> 00:24.917
And we weaned her off all the pills.

00:24.918 --> 00:29.111
You just needed to regenerate lung tissue,
didn't you?

00:29.112 --> 00:31.335
Oh, yes, you did!

00:31.336 --> 00:33.055
And the diaper?

00:33.056 --> 00:35.223
Yeah, she hasn't had any accidents.

00:35.224 --> 00:38.410
But we could still use it when
we want to sleep in, right?

00:38.411 --> 00:39.881
I guess.

00:39.882 --> 00:43.017
Oh, and we've been feeding
her only chicken and rice.

00:43.018 --> 00:45.505
I figured you wouldn't get
to make any till tomorrow,

00:45.506 --> 00:47.377
so here's some to give her for dinner.

00:47.378 --> 00:49.936
Wow. She looks so young and vibrant.

00:49.937 --> 00:52.234
Maybe I should stay
with you for a few days.

00:52.235 --> 00:53.625
[Both laugh]

00:53.626 --> 00:56.658
Okay, Doris, you ready to come home?

00:56.659 --> 00:57.662
[Straining] Ohh!

00:57.663 --> 01:00.662
Doris, come on. Oh.

01:05.313 --> 01:07.215
[Sighs]

01:07.716 --> 01:08.949
What are you supposed to be?

01:08.950 --> 01:12.620
Dad, I told you...
it was '60s day at school.

01:12.621 --> 01:14.021
I'm a hippie...

01:14.022 --> 01:15.823
but the good-girl one, not the druggy one.

01:15.824 --> 01:17.024
It's spirit week,

01:17.025 --> 01:19.627
so we dress up as something
different every day.

01:19.628 --> 01:22.196
Didn't you notice yesterday
I was dressed as a baby?

01:22.197 --> 01:24.732
Sure, Sue. Let's say I did.

01:24.733 --> 01:26.167
[Door opens]

01:26.168 --> 01:28.736
Well, apparently, Doris would rather live

01:28.737 --> 01:30.905
over at the Donahues' than here.

01:30.906 --> 01:32.306
Get in line, Doris.

01:32.307 --> 01:33.807
[Whimpering]

01:33.808 --> 01:35.743
Do we know what we're having for dinner?

01:35.744 --> 01:36.978
Chicken and rice.

01:39.581 --> 01:42.116
Don't tell Darrin.
I'll meet you in the bedroom.

01:42.117 --> 01:45.819
Okay. I'm gonna go change
out of these groovy duds.

01:45.820 --> 01:48.689
Peace out, my brothers. [Laughs]

01:48.690 --> 01:49.957
That's '60s, right?

01:49.958 --> 01:51.325
[Chuckles]

01:51.326 --> 01:54.328
Mrs. Heck, I need to talk to you

01:54.329 --> 01:56.597
about a matter of extreme importance.

01:56.598 --> 01:58.632
As you know, Saturday is Valentine's day.

01:58.633 --> 02:00.901
Or, as we call it, Saturday.

02:00.902 --> 02:02.136
Well, I'm planning

02:02.137 --> 02:04.138
a big Valentine's day
Scavenger Hunt for Sue,

02:04.139 --> 02:05.239
and I need your help.

02:05.240 --> 02:06.907
Ohh. Really, Darrin?

02:06.908 --> 02:08.108
No, it's super-small...

02:08.109 --> 02:10.144
only 10 locations and
a surprise at the end.

02:10.145 --> 02:13.747
So I'm gonna need you at a bench
in the mall in a cowboy hat.

02:13.748 --> 02:15.216
Yeah. I'm not doing that.

02:15.217 --> 02:17.885
Okay, would you be willing to
give her the first clue here?

02:17.886 --> 02:19.553
That, I can do.

02:19.554 --> 02:21.822
Great. I'll get my mom
to do the mall thing.

02:21.823 --> 02:23.624
She's always there power-walking.

02:23.625 --> 02:25.826
Anyway, I'm gonna go sit on the couch now.

02:25.827 --> 02:29.563
Pretend like nothing happened.

02:29.564 --> 02:30.631
[Whistling]

02:30.632 --> 02:32.333
I'm just whistling for no reason.

02:32.334 --> 02:33.902
Who am I to throw stones?

02:35.704 --> 02:37.905
Hey, Brick. So, what about you?

02:37.906 --> 02:40.207
You doing anything with
Cindy for Valentine's day?

02:40.208 --> 02:41.875
Oh. Right. Cindy.

02:41.876 --> 02:43.777
I'm not sure we're still going out.

02:43.778 --> 02:45.746
What do you mean, you're not sure?

02:45.747 --> 02:48.082
I don't know.
We haven't really talked for a few months.

02:48.083 --> 02:49.850
Why? Did something happen?

02:49.851 --> 02:51.619
No, nothing I can think of.

02:51.620 --> 02:53.587
She might have been sick for a while.

02:53.588 --> 02:54.722
Or she moved.

02:54.723 --> 02:56.924
No, wait... she sits behind me in homeroom.

02:56.925 --> 02:58.859
Well, before I go to the drugstore

02:58.860 --> 03:00.995
and drop 99 cents on a box of candy,

03:00.996 --> 03:02.162
it'd be nice to know.

03:02.163 --> 03:03.797
Cindy, are we still going out?

03:03.798 --> 03:04.798
Yes.

03:04.799 --> 03:06.867
Okay.

03:06.868 --> 03:09.336
Ooh. Hey, check this out.

03:09.337 --> 03:12.573
Canned cheese on cheese.

03:12.574 --> 03:13.807
Oh. Huh?

03:13.808 --> 03:14.808
Mm.

03:14.809 --> 03:17.645
So... Saturday's Valentine's day.

03:17.646 --> 03:20.047
Ugh. Valentine's day. Bleah!

03:20.048 --> 03:21.582
[Chuckles] Yeah.

03:21.583 --> 03:23.117
You want to do something?

03:23.118 --> 03:25.853
No. I hate Valentine's day.

03:25.854 --> 03:27.187
Seriously, don't get me anything,

03:27.188 --> 03:28.656
or I'll punch you in the neck.

03:28.657 --> 03:30.658
Really? Not even flowers?

03:30.659 --> 03:32.993
You get me flowers, I'll make you eat them.

03:32.994 --> 03:35.163
[Snaps fingers]

03:36.231 --> 03:38.833
Heart on a cracker? Huh?

03:41.336 --> 03:43.605
I knew there was a reason I liked you.

03:46.908 --> 03:48.642
Okay, you know what? [Whimpering]

03:48.643 --> 03:49.843
The Donahues aren't that great.

03:49.844 --> 03:51.679
We treat you pretty good around here.

03:51.680 --> 03:53.647
You don't think I'd like
to lie on the couch all day

03:53.648 --> 03:55.149
and chew on an old belt?

03:55.150 --> 03:56.550
I would.

03:56.551 --> 03:57.619
[Door closes]

03:59.054 --> 04:00.220
Well, I checked,

04:00.221 --> 04:02.556
and Cindy and I are
definitely still an item.

04:02.557 --> 04:04.758
Shoot. Then I guess you're
gonna have to do something.

04:04.759 --> 04:07.728
Will I? It's on a Saturday.
I won't even see her.

04:07.729 --> 04:09.296
Brick, people who like each other

04:09.297 --> 04:10.964
like to spend time together.

04:10.965 --> 04:13.634
Mike! I'm talking to your son about dating!
Get in here!

04:13.635 --> 04:14.902
Mike: No.

04:14.903 --> 04:18.038
Mike, seriously, get in here!
Talk to your son!

04:18.039 --> 04:19.807
No! I've got nothing to add.

04:19.808 --> 04:21.809
Look, if you really like Cindy...

04:21.810 --> 04:24.611
Oh! The chemistry between us is undeniable.

04:24.612 --> 04:26.213
Then you got to do a little something,

04:26.214 --> 04:29.550
even if you just invite her over
and take her out for ice cream.

04:29.551 --> 04:32.119
Well, I do like ice cream,
and I do like Cindy,

04:32.120 --> 04:35.622
so it's pretty likely I'd
enjoy those things together.

04:35.623 --> 04:37.225
Seems like a solid plan.

04:43.832 --> 04:45.199
Ooh!

04:45.200 --> 04:46.233
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

04:46.234 --> 04:48.602
Look, there's no question what we have

04:48.603 --> 04:50.671
is a deep and special relationship,

04:50.672 --> 04:53.073
but it's not
"chocolate-covered strawberry" special.

04:53.074 --> 04:54.208
These are for my lady.

04:54.209 --> 04:55.576
Really? Oh!

04:55.577 --> 04:57.578
I just thought you'd found
a fun new way to eat fruit.

04:57.579 --> 04:58.679
I didn't know you were dating anyone.

04:58.680 --> 04:59.747
Hells yeah.

04:59.748 --> 05:01.215
I've been laying some serious groundwork

05:01.216 --> 05:02.616
with Macy from my history class...

05:02.617 --> 05:04.551
two dates and counting.

05:04.552 --> 05:05.652
[Laughs]

05:05.653 --> 05:07.621
And she's already got you doing
stuff for Valentine's day.

05:07.622 --> 05:08.622
Sucka!

05:08.623 --> 05:09.656
Don't "sucka" me, sucka.

05:09.657 --> 05:11.291
You got a straight-up girlfriend.

05:11.292 --> 05:12.760
You're in deep on the 14th.

05:12.761 --> 05:14.695
Nope. I am totally off the hook.

05:14.696 --> 05:16.196
Devin doesn't want to do anything.

05:16.197 --> 05:17.564
Yeah, right. No, really.

05:17.565 --> 05:18.899
She told me if I got her anything,

05:18.900 --> 05:20.834
she'd punch me in my neck,
and I like my neck.

05:20.835 --> 05:23.837
[Sighs] Seriously, Axl,
how long have you been a dude?

05:23.838 --> 05:25.672
There is no woman on earth

05:25.673 --> 05:28.041
who doesn't want something
for Valentine's day.

05:28.042 --> 05:29.576
Me, I'm going all out...

05:29.577 --> 05:32.112
roses, a bracelet,
then I'm cooking her dinner

05:32.113 --> 05:34.581
and making reservations
at a nice restaurant.

05:34.582 --> 05:36.250
Wait... you planned all that?

05:36.251 --> 05:38.118
You guys only went on two dates.

05:38.119 --> 05:39.953
It's Valentine's day, son...

05:39.954 --> 05:42.656
the day upon which all men shall be judged.

05:42.657 --> 05:44.958
Devin said she didn't want anything!

05:44.959 --> 05:47.261
You hearing this, Kenny?
You hear what this guy's saying?

05:47.262 --> 05:48.997
[Keyboard clacking]

05:52.734 --> 05:55.235
Cindy, do you want to come
over for Valentine's day

05:55.236 --> 05:57.137
- and go out for ice cream?
- Okay.

05:57.138 --> 05:58.306
And then you'll kiss me.

06:03.111 --> 06:04.878
[Sighs]

06:04.879 --> 06:06.747
So...

06:06.748 --> 06:10.083
You will not believe all the
crap Hutch is going through

06:10.084 --> 06:13.020
for this Macy girl for Valentine's day.

06:13.021 --> 06:15.756
Bracelet, cooking her dinner...
dumb, right?

06:15.757 --> 06:17.624
I don't know... it is kind of sweet

06:17.625 --> 06:19.993
to think of somebody
going to all that effort.

06:19.994 --> 06:21.595
Really?

06:21.596 --> 06:22.663
No, you big tool!

06:22.664 --> 06:24.565
I told you I hate Valentine's day.

06:24.566 --> 06:25.566
Bleah!

06:25.567 --> 06:27.168
[Laughs]

06:28.670 --> 06:31.138
Seriously, character day was awesome.

06:31.139 --> 06:34.041
All the football players dressed
up like Disney princesses!

06:34.042 --> 06:36.009
You know, I never used to understand

06:36.010 --> 06:38.946
why football players dressed
up like women was so funny,

06:38.947 --> 06:41.616
but now that I'm a senior,
I totally get it.

06:42.584 --> 06:44.218
Speaking of special days,

06:44.219 --> 06:47.654
did I overhear you and Darrin
discussing Valentine's day

06:47.655 --> 06:50.057
and some kind of surprise?

06:50.058 --> 06:52.226
Not sure I know what you're talking about.

06:52.227 --> 06:53.260
I definitely don't.

06:53.261 --> 06:55.229
'Cause I casually mentioned to Darrin

06:55.230 --> 06:56.797
that there's this sweater I like

06:56.798 --> 06:58.966
with the word "believe" written across it,

06:58.967 --> 07:00.634
and back then,
I said I wanted the blue one,

07:00.635 --> 07:02.769
but now I really want the red one,

07:02.770 --> 07:04.705
so if he happens to ask again,

07:04.706 --> 07:06.640
that's the one I definitely want.

07:06.641 --> 07:10.945
But... Didn't hear it from me.

07:13.314 --> 07:14.581
Brick, are you okay?

07:14.582 --> 07:16.250
You haven't touched Doris' food.

07:16.251 --> 07:18.218
Cindy expects me to kiss her in two days,

07:18.219 --> 07:19.653
and I'm very apprehensive.

07:19.654 --> 07:20.687
What are you talking about?

07:20.688 --> 07:22.322
You kissed that girl in north Carolina.

07:22.323 --> 07:24.725
No, I was the kissee.
I've never been the kisser.

07:24.726 --> 07:26.293
I don't know what I'm supposed to do.

07:26.294 --> 07:28.028
It's like handing me
the keys to a jet plane

07:28.029 --> 07:29.263
and just saying, "fly."

07:29.264 --> 07:31.031
[Chuckles] Brick, it's not that hard.

07:31.032 --> 07:32.833
I-it just sort of happens in the moment.

07:32.834 --> 07:34.968
I need more than
"it happens in the moment."

07:34.969 --> 07:37.104
I can't be spontaneous
unless I plan for it.

07:37.105 --> 07:38.639
It's not a big deal.

07:38.640 --> 07:41.708
You just stand there,
close your eyes, and lean in.

07:41.709 --> 07:43.944
But if my eyes are closed,
how will I know where the target is?

07:43.945 --> 07:45.679
Well, you know where lips are, don't you?

07:45.680 --> 07:47.548
You've been looking at
faces your whole life.

07:47.549 --> 07:48.582
He really hasn't.

07:48.583 --> 07:49.983
You know, Brick, you can keep them open,

07:49.984 --> 07:52.619
and then once you get there,
you can close them, right, Mike?

07:52.620 --> 07:53.620
Yeah, that's fine.

07:53.621 --> 07:54.988
What's fine?!

07:54.989 --> 07:57.625
Okay, so then I leave them open,
but what then?

07:58.326 --> 08:01.194
W... I-I don't know.
It's not that specific.

08:01.195 --> 08:03.597
I think we're slicing too thin here.

08:03.598 --> 08:06.166
You just have to kind of... feel it.

08:06.167 --> 08:08.001
W-what's this?

08:08.002 --> 08:10.003
What am I supposed to do with my hands?

08:10.004 --> 08:12.606
Well,
there's a lot of options for your hands,

08:12.607 --> 08:13.874
but you're a kid,

08:13.875 --> 08:16.743
so focus on the back/upper-shoulder area.

08:16.744 --> 08:18.812
Um, she's tall, Mike.
That's not gonna work.

08:18.813 --> 08:21.615
Oh, God, you're right.
Cindy's got 2 feet on me easy.

08:21.616 --> 08:23.684
Don't worry, Brick.
Look at your dad and me.

08:23.685 --> 08:26.053
There's a huge height difference,
and we make it work.

08:26.054 --> 08:28.089
Here, we'll show you. Here. Come here.

08:29.591 --> 08:31.625
Okay, I'll be you, and your dad's Cindy.

08:31.626 --> 08:34.794
I don't want to be Cindy.
Why can't I just be a tall guy?

08:34.796 --> 08:35.861
'Cause I'm the guy.

08:35.863 --> 08:37.731
All right, fine. No one's anyone.

08:37.732 --> 08:39.765
You're just some random tall person,

08:39.767 --> 08:41.101
and I'm a generic short person.

08:41.102 --> 08:42.602
Nothing weird,

08:42.604 --> 08:44.871
just two genderless strangers
kissing in front of a boy.

08:44.872 --> 08:46.206
Fine.

08:46.207 --> 08:48.709
No, no, no, stop.
I'm supposed to be the kisser.

08:48.710 --> 08:51.578
Okay, Brick, now,
you want to pull Cindy to you,

08:51.579 --> 08:54.648
but you're gonna need
something to grab onto.

08:54.649 --> 08:56.650
Oh! I know! She has that safari hat.

08:56.651 --> 08:58.785
So you can just grab the hat flaps.

08:58.786 --> 09:00.287
Okay, I'm gonna pretend

09:00.288 --> 09:02.956
your dad's ears are the hat flaps, okay?

09:02.957 --> 09:04.291
[Door opens] Mm?

09:04.292 --> 09:05.726
Then mmm.

09:05.727 --> 09:06.927
- Mmm.
- Oh, God!

09:06.928 --> 09:09.696
Look away, Brick!
Look away before you turn to stone!

09:09.697 --> 09:10.998
We're not kissing because we want to.

09:10.999 --> 09:12.699
It's for teaching purposes.

09:12.700 --> 09:13.800
You shouldn't be doing that.

09:13.801 --> 09:15.602
Now he's gonna associate
kissing with something gross.

09:15.603 --> 09:17.704
[Sighs] Look, nobody told me what to do.

09:17.705 --> 09:20.040
Just let him just fumble his way
through it, like everybody else.

09:20.041 --> 09:21.341
Cindy wants me to kiss her.

09:21.342 --> 09:24.611
And you went to mom and dad instead of me?
Rookie mistake.

09:24.612 --> 09:27.114
Okay, smart guy,
what's your brilliant advice?

09:27.115 --> 09:28.715
I say get it over with early in the date.

09:28.716 --> 09:29.750
That way, all the pressure's off.

09:29.751 --> 09:31.251
If you wait too long, you get too nervous.

09:31.252 --> 09:33.553
Actually, Brick, that's a good idea.

09:33.554 --> 09:35.022
Don't agree with me, mom.
It wrecks my point.

09:35.023 --> 09:36.723
Look, the hardest part

09:36.724 --> 09:38.692
is trying to know whether or
not she wants to kiss you,

09:38.693 --> 09:40.227
and you already know she does,
so you're golden.

09:40.228 --> 09:41.728
Just put your mouth on her mouth.

09:41.729 --> 09:43.030
And remember this code I made up...

09:43.031 --> 09:44.898
keep it simple, stupid.

09:44.899 --> 09:49.002
Oh. I get it... k-i-s-s.
"Keep it simple, stupid."

09:49.003 --> 09:51.204
Oh, yeah. I never thought about that.

09:51.205 --> 09:52.707
Wow! I am good.

09:55.243 --> 09:56.610
Okay, listen. [Sighs]

09:56.611 --> 09:58.812
I got to say something,
but I don't want you

09:58.813 --> 10:01.081
to get all weird and
overly excited about it.

10:01.082 --> 10:02.315
I won't. What is it?

10:02.316 --> 10:03.583
[Sighs]

10:03.584 --> 10:05.018
I need your advice.

10:05.019 --> 10:06.687
Ooh! Whoo!

10:06.688 --> 10:07.788
Okay.

10:07.789 --> 10:09.122
Would you just be cool?

10:09.123 --> 10:10.691
I'm cool. Totally cool.

10:10.692 --> 10:12.626
Just... just so happy right now.

10:12.627 --> 10:13.927
[Giggles]

10:13.928 --> 10:17.631
Okay, so, Devin says she doesn't
want anything for Valentine's day,

10:17.632 --> 10:19.933
but then Hutch says every
girl wants something,

10:19.934 --> 10:21.968
and I just really like her,
and I don't want to blow it.

10:21.969 --> 10:23.603
Okay. Okay.

10:23.604 --> 10:25.138
So that's the question on the table...

10:25.139 --> 10:28.575
"says no, might mean yes."

10:28.576 --> 10:32.612
And you've come to me, your mom,
to help you figure it out...

10:32.613 --> 10:34.581
which I love, by the way.

10:34.582 --> 10:36.016
Mom! Okay. Got it.

10:36.017 --> 10:38.785
Um, well, you know,
I had a birthday party once,

10:38.786 --> 10:41.021
and I said I didn't want any presents,

10:41.022 --> 10:43.690
but I got them anyway,
and I totally loved it.

10:43.691 --> 10:45.092
Then again, she's not me.

10:45.093 --> 10:46.860
She might really mean what she says.

10:46.861 --> 10:48.628
I mean, sometimes I mean what I say.

10:48.629 --> 10:51.264
See, it's like with your dad.
You know, we have our thing.

10:51.265 --> 10:52.599
We know what we do.

10:52.600 --> 10:53.700
You'll understand when you're married...

10:53.701 --> 10:55.569
maybe to Devin, who I picked out for you.

10:55.570 --> 10:56.570
Goodbye.

10:56.571 --> 10:57.604
No, no, no, no, no!

10:57.605 --> 10:58.805
No, no, no, no, no, no!

10:58.806 --> 11:00.674
No, no! Don't go! I wasn't ready!

11:00.675 --> 11:02.342
I was just trying to get it right!

11:02.343 --> 11:03.610
This was a hard one!

11:03.611 --> 11:07.048
Okay, come back anytime. I love our talks.

11:11.252 --> 11:12.986
Okay, while Sue's at Spudsy's,

11:12.987 --> 11:15.622
I want to go over the plans for
the Scavenger Hunt tomorrow.

11:15.623 --> 11:17.657
Mrs. Heck,
you're giving her the first clue.

11:17.658 --> 11:19.726
You'll be here with
doughnuts in the morning.

11:19.727 --> 11:21.995
- Are you providing the doughnuts?
- Yeah.

11:21.996 --> 11:24.064
- Better make it two boxes.
- Got it.

11:24.065 --> 11:26.800
And, Mr. Heck,
can you be at the Bowling Alley at 3:00,

11:26.801 --> 11:27.801
holding a rose?

11:27.802 --> 11:29.169
No.

11:29.170 --> 11:32.139
Can you be at Claire's
Boutique at the mall at 4:00?

11:32.140 --> 11:33.173
No.

11:33.174 --> 11:35.075
In the park with a balloon at 5:00?

11:35.076 --> 11:36.210
No.

11:36.211 --> 11:39.679
If you change "Bowling Alley,"
"mall," or "park" to "couch,"

11:39.680 --> 11:40.781
then I'm your guy.

11:40.782 --> 11:43.251
Awesome. Thanks for being so flexible.

11:46.320 --> 11:48.989
Hey, I'm here.

11:48.990 --> 11:51.691
Did you know there's
throw-up on your steps?

11:51.692 --> 11:53.260
Mm, yeah. It's supposed to rain tomorrow.

11:53.261 --> 11:54.327
Oh.

11:54.328 --> 11:55.829
Do you want to watch the game here,

11:55.830 --> 11:57.264
or do you want to go to the union?

11:57.265 --> 11:58.665
Actually, I know you said

11:58.666 --> 12:01.301
you didn't want to do anything
for Valentine's day...

12:01.302 --> 12:03.136
Oh, no.
Where do you want it... head or gut?

12:03.137 --> 12:04.604
No. No, no, no, no, no.

12:04.605 --> 12:07.107
We are not celebrating
Valentine's day tomorrow.

12:07.108 --> 12:11.077
However, today is World Radio day.

12:11.078 --> 12:13.079
You don't have a problem with that, right?

12:13.080 --> 12:14.581
I don't know. What is it?

12:14.582 --> 12:17.317
Just some holiday I
read about on Wikipedia.

12:17.318 --> 12:19.586
I mean, it was invented three years ago,

12:19.587 --> 12:21.988
so there's no lame traditions,
like cupids or roses.

12:21.989 --> 12:23.890
They don't even have cards for it.
I checked.

12:23.891 --> 12:25.125
Liking it so far.

12:25.126 --> 12:26.126
Good.

12:26.127 --> 12:28.228
So, in honor of World Radio day

12:28.229 --> 12:30.931
and the special place you hold in my heart,

12:30.932 --> 12:33.567
I give you...

12:33.568 --> 12:34.601
This houseplant!

12:34.602 --> 12:36.324
Why, thank you.

12:36.325 --> 12:38.029
Well, to be fair, it came with the house,

12:38.030 --> 12:39.988
and you might want to water it.

12:39.989 --> 12:41.074
Next...

12:41.075 --> 12:42.843
[Singsong voice] I made your favorite.

12:42.844 --> 12:45.245
Three beef patties, stacked vertically,

12:45.246 --> 12:48.648
ordered in window number 1,
picked up in window number 2,

12:48.649 --> 12:51.651
with fries and a side of
fancy ketchup packets!

12:51.652 --> 12:54.254
And here I thought I was gonna
get nothing for Radio day.

12:54.255 --> 12:55.689
Unh-unh-unh-unh.

12:55.690 --> 12:57.725
Now, before we eat,
I have one more thing to show you.

12:58.960 --> 13:00.628
Follow me.

13:03.664 --> 13:06.099
Oh, my God!

13:06.100 --> 13:08.068
A bouncy house?!

13:08.069 --> 13:10.670
Nothing says "World Radio day"
like a bouncy house!

13:10.671 --> 13:12.906
- Right?
- [Laughs]

13:12.907 --> 13:14.541
Whoo!

13:14.542 --> 13:15.575
[Laughs]

13:15.576 --> 13:16.610
[Squeals]

13:16.611 --> 13:17.644
[Grunts]

13:17.645 --> 13:20.013
[Both laughing]

13:20.014 --> 13:21.014
So you like it?

13:21.015 --> 13:23.550
Are you kidding?! This is epic!

13:23.551 --> 13:26.586
You know me so well!

13:26.587 --> 13:29.689
So, uh,
what'd you get me for Valentine's day?

13:29.690 --> 13:30.691
[Grunts]

13:37.265 --> 13:40.034
[Laughs]

13:41.702 --> 13:42.702
Good morning.

13:42.703 --> 13:44.204
Happy Valentine's day.

13:44.205 --> 13:46.740
Oh! Happy Valentine's day, mom!

13:46.741 --> 13:49.576
So, I've been told to deliver this.

13:49.577 --> 13:50.644
[Gasps]

13:50.645 --> 13:51.978
Half a box of doughnuts!

13:51.979 --> 13:53.614
Uh-huh.

13:55.650 --> 13:57.884
"Hope your Valentine's day is a real ball.

13:57.885 --> 13:59.920
"Your next clue's at Yankee candle

13:59.921 --> 14:01.788
at Pioneer Galaxy Mall."

14:01.789 --> 14:02.822
[Laughs]

14:02.823 --> 14:04.991
[Gasps] It's a Scavenger Hunt. Aah!

14:04.992 --> 14:07.227
Isn't he the best boyfriend ever?!

14:07.228 --> 14:09.262
[Gasps] Maybe there'll be a
sweater at the end of this.

14:09.263 --> 14:10.897
You told Darrin the red,
not the blue, right?

14:10.898 --> 14:12.299
You know what? Don't even tell me.

14:12.300 --> 14:13.667
I want to be surprised.

14:13.668 --> 14:16.202
[Squeals]

14:16.203 --> 14:18.873
Oh, to be excited about something.

14:21.275 --> 14:22.909
Who schedules a kiss?!

14:22.910 --> 14:25.178
You know what else is scheduled?
Executions.

14:25.179 --> 14:26.646
What I wouldn't give

14:26.647 --> 14:28.615
to be a complacent
married couple right now.

14:28.616 --> 14:30.684
Lots of kisses led up to this freedom.

14:30.685 --> 14:31.685
Am I running a fever?

14:31.686 --> 14:33.086
'Cause if I am, I shouldn't do this.

14:33.087 --> 14:34.554
Brick, calm down.

14:34.555 --> 14:36.056
- You calm down!
- [Doorbell rings]

14:36.057 --> 14:38.592
Oh, God.
Why does she always have to be so prompt?

14:42.296 --> 14:44.065
Yeah?

14:46.834 --> 14:48.668
Hi, Brick. It's 2:00.

14:48.669 --> 14:50.737
I was here at 1:47, but you said 2:00,

14:50.738 --> 14:51.805
so I read your mail.

14:51.806 --> 14:53.540
They're gonna shut off your water.

14:53.541 --> 14:54.574
Oh. Huh.

14:54.575 --> 14:56.177
Come in, Cindy.

14:58.346 --> 15:00.313
Would you like to chat with my parents?

15:00.314 --> 15:02.582
I thought we were going to go
out for ice cream and then kiss.

15:02.583 --> 15:05.552
Oh. Yes. I do recall that.

15:05.553 --> 15:07.254
Ice cream, kissing.

15:08.322 --> 15:10.323
That reminds me of a funny story.

15:10.324 --> 15:11.926
But first, a beverage.

15:13.160 --> 15:14.728
Aaah!

15:14.729 --> 15:17.664
Okay. You are not going to
believe where I've been...

15:17.665 --> 15:21.067
the mall, the fire station,
chip's motel and canoe rental.

15:21.068 --> 15:24.571
The produce guy at the frugal
hoosier gave me this clue.

15:24.572 --> 15:26.840
"See if you can solve this quiz.

15:26.841 --> 15:30.277
Go to where your dad always is."

15:31.779 --> 15:34.681
No, no, no. You have to read it.
Everybody's been doing it.

15:34.682 --> 15:36.316
One guy did a French accent!

15:36.317 --> 15:37.650
Oh.

15:37.651 --> 15:40.720
I'll be doing a tired American.

15:40.721 --> 15:44.724
"He's part of Boss Co.,
but he's not Axl or me.

15:44.725 --> 15:48.261
You'll find the next clue
across the stree... t."

15:48.262 --> 15:50.096
Donahues' house!

15:50.097 --> 15:51.598
[Doris howling]

15:51.599 --> 15:53.233
[Sighs] [Door opens, closes]

15:53.234 --> 15:55.803
And that's why I never use
hand dryers in restrooms.

15:57.038 --> 15:58.772
Well, that's all the small talk I got,

15:58.773 --> 16:00.574
so I guess we should go.

16:02.000 --> 16:08.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

16:09.850 --> 16:12.119
[Door closes]

16:14.822 --> 16:16.623
Excuse me.

16:16.624 --> 16:18.259
I'm about to be spontaneous.

16:20.327 --> 16:22.062
Oh. Velcro.

16:22.063 --> 16:24.130
I did not know they were detachable.

16:24.131 --> 16:25.331
Smart design.

16:25.332 --> 16:27.234
[Sighs]

16:36.277 --> 16:38.645
[Gasps] Oh, my God! Mike, it's happening!

16:38.646 --> 16:40.647
He went in early, like Axl said.

16:40.648 --> 16:41.915
Hey, that's my boy.

16:41.916 --> 16:44.884
Oh, wow. They're still going.

16:44.885 --> 16:47.154
And they're still going.

16:57.598 --> 16:59.699
Mike, we did teach him about stopping,
right?

16:59.700 --> 17:01.201
I didn't think we had to.

17:01.202 --> 17:02.302
I think we had to.

17:02.303 --> 17:04.304
I mean,
they're not even moving their heads.

17:04.305 --> 17:05.605
They're like statues.

17:05.606 --> 17:08.340
Look at her neck. That's got to hurt.

17:08.342 --> 17:09.709
Frankie, I think we should break this up.

17:09.710 --> 17:11.778
No, that'll be embarrassing.

17:11.779 --> 17:13.847
Maybe we should just go out to the car.

17:13.848 --> 17:16.549
You know, when they see us,
they'll probably stop.

17:16.550 --> 17:17.784
What are we going out there for?

17:17.785 --> 17:19.752
We'll just say we're going to Walgreens.

17:21.555 --> 17:23.190
[Clears throat]

17:24.791 --> 17:26.659
Mike, did you lock the door?

17:26.660 --> 17:28.595
Yes, I did.

17:28.596 --> 17:30.630
What did you want to get from Walgreens?

17:30.631 --> 17:32.132
Uh, we need toilet paper.

17:32.133 --> 17:33.300
Oh, yeah.

17:40.875 --> 17:42.943
[Engine turns over]

17:44.778 --> 17:45.813
Now what?

17:47.014 --> 17:49.749
Well, we do need toilet paper.

17:49.750 --> 17:51.585
Guess we're going to Walgreens.

18:12.072 --> 18:13.573
There's my Valentine!

18:13.574 --> 18:14.641
[Squeals]

18:14.642 --> 18:16.342
Darrin! Ooh!

18:16.343 --> 18:19.045
This has just been the best day ever!

18:19.046 --> 18:21.681
All the clues,
and everybody's been so nice.

18:21.682 --> 18:24.184
Well, the manager at
the Bowling Alley had a little 'tude,

18:24.185 --> 18:26.052
but there were four parties going on today,

18:26.053 --> 18:27.153
so I totally get it.

18:27.154 --> 18:28.288
But I can't believe

18:28.289 --> 18:30.156
you set up all these
things in all these places,

18:30.157 --> 18:31.858
and I don't even know where we are now.

18:31.859 --> 18:33.126
Where are we?

18:33.127 --> 18:35.229
The last stop in your Scavenger Hunt.
Come in.

18:38.132 --> 18:39.632
Surprise!

18:39.633 --> 18:41.067
Welcome to my house.

18:41.068 --> 18:42.101
What?

18:42.102 --> 18:43.770
Well, you know, I've been working hard

18:43.771 --> 18:45.572
and saving my air-conditioning money,

18:45.573 --> 18:46.606
so I bought this house.

18:46.607 --> 18:48.308
Just closed on it yesterday.

18:48.309 --> 18:49.809
Oh, wow.

18:49.810 --> 18:52.045
I mean... Wow!

18:52.046 --> 18:54.080
It's great,
'cause the kitchen and the living room

18:54.081 --> 18:56.183
are in the same room,
and back there's the bedroom.

19:02.623 --> 19:06.092
It's nice how the bed
touches all four walls.

19:06.093 --> 19:08.761
Yeah. Now I never have to worry
about falling off the bed.

19:08.762 --> 19:10.063
[Laughs]

19:10.064 --> 19:13.967
And look...
this folds down into a kitchen table.

19:13.968 --> 19:16.069
These fold into seats.

19:16.070 --> 19:17.136
Oh.

19:17.137 --> 19:20.807
And this folds down into a couch.

19:20.808 --> 19:22.076
Ah.

19:23.978 --> 19:27.114
Do any of them fold down into a sweater?

19:33.120 --> 19:34.988
You know, today is Valentine's day,

19:34.989 --> 19:37.257
and we haven't even
talked about you and me.

19:37.258 --> 19:38.558
Yeah, well, you know.

19:38.559 --> 19:41.227
So... I got you a little something.

19:41.228 --> 19:42.328
Aww.

19:42.329 --> 19:45.632
Well, it just so happens I got
you a little something, too.

19:45.633 --> 19:48.635
- What?
- Mm-hmm.

19:48.636 --> 19:51.638
Hey! Sports Illustrated. Thank you.

19:51.639 --> 19:53.840
Ooh! French onion Pringles!

19:53.841 --> 19:55.842
Guess you're not gonna be
kissing me tonight, hm?

19:55.843 --> 19:56.843
[Chuckles]

19:56.844 --> 19:58.878
Ooh! You got the Tweezers I wanted!

19:58.879 --> 20:01.214
Yeah, well,
you've been mentioning it, so...

20:01.215 --> 20:03.816
All right!
A giant remote so I can see the numbers!

20:03.817 --> 20:05.084
[Chuckles]

20:05.085 --> 20:06.686
Aww.

20:06.687 --> 20:08.054
And you always say

20:08.055 --> 20:11.090
how embarrassed you are
to go into the lady aisle.

20:11.091 --> 20:12.558
Happy Valentine's day, Frankie.

20:12.559 --> 20:15.328
Mmm. Happy Valentine's day.

20:15.329 --> 20:18.331
So, you think it's safe to go home?

20:18.332 --> 20:21.601
Yeah. They got to be done by now.

20:21.602 --> 20:23.303
Wow, Darrin.

20:23.304 --> 20:26.072
Well, you're a homeowner. Congratulations.

20:26.073 --> 20:28.107
This is so exciting for you.

20:28.108 --> 20:31.210
Actually, Sue, there's one more surprise.

20:31.211 --> 20:32.812
The house isn't mine.

20:32.813 --> 20:34.180
It isn't?

20:34.181 --> 20:35.181
No.

20:35.182 --> 20:37.017
It's ours.

20:42.323 --> 20:44.625
Sue Heck, will you marry me?

21:11.618 --> 21:13.619
Okay. You're done.

21:13.620 --> 21:16.856
Happy Valentine's day, Cindy.

21:16.857 --> 21:18.158
Nailed it.
