00:31.406 --> 00:33.565
Another visit so soon?

00:33.929 --> 00:35.453
I thought perhaps you and I

00:35.478 --> 00:38.136
might make amends over tea.

00:38.906 --> 00:41.247
I take it destroying the girl's belief

00:41.291 --> 00:44.427
is proving to be more
challenging than expected.

00:44.685 --> 00:46.227
Yes.

00:46.329 --> 00:51.332
Lucy has... quite the resilient spirit.

00:51.434 --> 00:53.801
It's a pity.

00:53.903 --> 00:55.670
Because if she doesn't
forfeit her belief,

00:55.772 --> 00:58.306
you'll never see your Anastasia again.

00:59.377 --> 01:00.377
I know.

01:02.565 --> 01:05.580
So tell me, what do I do?

01:05.682 --> 01:09.717
Do you know what your
mistake has always been?

01:09.881 --> 01:12.649
You see belief as something solid...

01:13.009 --> 01:14.041
independent.

01:14.563 --> 01:17.525
Something easily removed
with one, singular blow.

01:17.627 --> 01:19.527
But belief is a weed.

01:19.629 --> 01:21.334
It grows wild and deep.

01:21.959 --> 01:25.066
If you want to destroy it for good,

01:25.168 --> 01:27.401
you have to uproot it.

01:29.539 --> 01:32.907
So I sever her belief by the root.

01:34.435 --> 01:35.990
Oh, how rude of me.

01:37.647 --> 01:38.913
Did you want a cup?

01:39.015 --> 01:40.348
You must be parched.

01:40.450 --> 01:42.647
Not that swill!

01:42.928 --> 01:45.553
I want my tea.

01:45.983 --> 01:47.950
My special brew.

01:48.288 --> 01:50.702
You will get your tea...

01:50.727 --> 01:52.760
after you give me what I want.

01:55.665 --> 01:58.657
Now, which root do I begin with?

02:02.071 --> 02:03.704
Where's Grandma?

02:03.806 --> 02:06.073
- Ballet starts in 10 minutes.
- Hush.

02:06.175 --> 02:08.014
I'm trying to find an
annoyed babysitter emoji.

02:12.181 --> 02:13.948
Aunt Sabine!

02:14.050 --> 02:15.650
What are you doing here?

02:15.752 --> 02:17.051
Excellent question.

02:17.153 --> 02:18.633
You know, this is a private property,

02:18.688 --> 02:20.768
so unless you've risen up
in the world from fry cook,

02:20.857 --> 02:22.490
you don't belong here.

02:22.592 --> 02:24.292
I just came to give Lucy this.

02:27.096 --> 02:28.496
Your famous beignets!

02:28.598 --> 02:30.031
They're not nearly as fun to make

02:30.133 --> 02:32.400
without my favorite taste tester.

02:33.770 --> 02:35.870
Mother, I've been trying
to get a hold of you

02:35.972 --> 02:36.972
for the last hour.

02:37.073 --> 02:38.239
Where have you been?

02:38.341 --> 02:40.868
Funny, here I thought you worked for me.

02:40.893 --> 02:42.922
Run along to the herbalist
and pick up a few things.

02:42.946 --> 02:44.345
The herbalist?

02:44.524 --> 02:46.090
Are you doing a cleanse without me?

02:46.115 --> 02:47.748
Now, Ivy,

02:47.850 --> 02:50.609
try less whimpering and more scampering.

02:52.589 --> 02:54.589
Sabine, what a coincidence.

02:54.691 --> 02:56.123
I was just talking about you.

02:56.225 --> 02:57.484
You were? Why?

02:57.509 --> 02:59.293
I was going over your rental agreement.

02:59.395 --> 03:01.796
And I've decided to
increase your rent 8%

03:01.898 --> 03:02.898
starting this month.

03:02.932 --> 03:04.799
You know we can't afford that.

03:04.901 --> 03:06.218
Given the booming neighborhood,

03:06.243 --> 03:07.802
I could ask for double.

03:07.904 --> 03:09.270
Consider it a family discount.

03:09.372 --> 03:11.806
You can't do this,
Grandma. It isn't fair.

03:11.908 --> 03:13.207
It's okay, Luce.

03:13.309 --> 03:14.394
I can fight my own battles.

03:14.419 --> 03:15.810
I always have.

03:15.912 --> 03:18.212
We both know this isn't
business, Victoria.

03:18.314 --> 03:20.514
You want to push us out?

03:20.617 --> 03:22.683
Well, we will just push right back.

03:37.767 --> 03:41.535
Ladies, gentlemen, honored guests,

03:41.638 --> 03:43.153
my daughter, Tiana, and I

03:43.178 --> 03:45.006
would like to welcome you to our home.

03:45.108 --> 03:47.174
Please look around.

03:47.276 --> 03:49.146
We will begin the auction shortly.

03:55.261 --> 03:56.594
Look at them,

03:56.619 --> 03:59.020
picking through our stuff like vultures.

03:59.122 --> 04:00.154
It's humiliating.

04:01.230 --> 04:02.960
Oh, it is, isn't it?

04:03.472 --> 04:05.459
Drizella.

04:05.528 --> 04:08.102
I didn't know we invited
the nouveau riche.

04:08.127 --> 04:09.587
Emphasis on "riche."

04:09.612 --> 04:10.731
I have to admit,

04:10.833 --> 04:11.838
I was intrigued

04:11.877 --> 04:14.044
when I heard of your little
fÃªte de faillite.

04:14.113 --> 04:16.007
But it seems that
everything of real value

04:16.031 --> 04:17.100
is already gone.

04:18.848 --> 04:21.221
Ooh, wait. What's this?

04:21.284 --> 04:22.415
That shouldn't be out here.

04:22.440 --> 04:23.439
It's not for sale.

04:23.464 --> 04:25.244
So it is worth something.

04:25.269 --> 04:26.269
Only to me.

04:26.667 --> 04:28.892
It was my father's.

04:29.037 --> 04:30.620
He earned it during the war,

04:30.645 --> 04:32.529
a reward for his heroism.

04:32.631 --> 04:34.398
I don't know how it got out here.

04:34.467 --> 04:36.307
Too bad that Daddy's no longer alive

04:36.359 --> 04:38.392
to save you and your mother from ruin.

04:39.158 --> 04:40.758
It's so sad.

04:43.730 --> 04:44.897
That's it, Mother.

04:44.922 --> 04:47.029
I can't watch our lives
be torn apart like this.

04:47.054 --> 04:48.817
We have no choice, Tiana.

04:48.842 --> 04:51.078
If we don't earn enough money today,

04:51.375 --> 04:52.518
we may have to sell the castle.

04:52.542 --> 04:54.085
But this is our home.

04:54.110 --> 04:56.277
We'll be tossed out
onto the street? I...

04:56.379 --> 04:59.347
The King has raised taxes
on everyone in the land.

04:59.415 --> 05:02.149
He lines his pockets
while his people starve.

05:02.251 --> 05:04.585
I thought my life would be different,

05:05.069 --> 05:07.336
filled with balls and... and romance.

05:07.669 --> 05:11.019
Oh, Tiana, this is not
what I wanted for you.

05:11.044 --> 05:12.949
If only you could find a prince.

05:12.974 --> 05:14.574
With all the chaos in the land,

05:14.599 --> 05:15.763
it's made heroes so scarce.

05:17.725 --> 05:18.925
Maybe I can.

05:19.844 --> 05:22.025
I think I have an idea
of where to start looking.

05:22.050 --> 05:23.915
Don't worry, Mother.

05:24.150 --> 05:26.157
I will find a good man,

05:26.182 --> 05:28.442
brave and heroic like father was,

05:28.762 --> 05:31.463
a prince who will save us.

05:42.035 --> 05:43.068
Well, I'm no cop,

05:43.093 --> 05:44.567
but for a case about a missing girl,

05:44.592 --> 05:45.947
that doesn't seem like a
whole a lot of evidence.

05:45.971 --> 05:47.582
Which makes Eloise
Gardener's disappearance

05:47.606 --> 05:49.387
all the more difficult to solve.

05:49.412 --> 05:52.278
The case went cold about
10 years ago this month.

05:52.303 --> 05:55.447
It's become a kind of
side project of mine.

05:55.472 --> 05:57.604
Why is it so important to you?

05:57.629 --> 06:00.563
We all got things that gnaw at us.

06:00.853 --> 06:02.896
The keg room has a strong lock.

06:02.921 --> 06:06.144
Plus, my baseball bat
and friendly demeanor

06:06.169 --> 06:08.170
will keep away any prying
eyes you're worried about.

06:08.194 --> 06:09.260
Thanks.

06:09.358 --> 06:10.946
I better head back to the station.

06:10.971 --> 06:12.203
What is that?

06:13.007 --> 06:14.169
Oh, this was hers.

06:14.194 --> 06:15.365
It contains sketches,

06:15.468 --> 06:17.926
some angsty teenage poetry.

06:17.951 --> 06:18.980
I like to thumb through it

06:19.004 --> 06:21.171
when things get quiet at the precinct.

06:21.273 --> 06:23.185
You know, I'm all about commitment,

06:23.210 --> 06:24.508
but, uh, I think maybe

06:24.610 --> 06:26.474
you should pick up a hobby or two.

06:27.669 --> 06:29.313
I'll take that into consideration.

06:29.954 --> 06:31.420
Thanks again.

06:33.171 --> 06:34.938
All right, I'll go ahead
and put this back there now.

06:34.962 --> 06:36.195
In a minute.

06:36.557 --> 06:38.778
First, tell me why you were in here

06:38.803 --> 06:40.276
with Ivy the other night.

06:40.301 --> 06:41.634
I had a drink with her.

06:41.659 --> 06:43.524
- What's the big deal?
- The big deal?

06:43.549 --> 06:46.830
Well, she is Victoria
Belfrey's daughter.

06:47.257 --> 06:48.290
Well, I don't know.

06:48.315 --> 06:50.729
I-I think that Ivy may surprise you.

06:50.754 --> 06:53.037
You know, she got a taste
of standing up to her mother.

06:53.062 --> 06:54.296
She might be willing to help us.

06:54.320 --> 06:56.620
Henry, I've seen this story before.

06:56.645 --> 06:57.708
Believe me...

06:57.810 --> 06:59.710
It doesn't end with you happy.

07:08.445 --> 07:09.510
What are you doing here?

07:09.535 --> 07:10.333
I thought you were off today.

07:10.358 --> 07:11.855
Jacinda, I have great news.

07:11.957 --> 07:14.255
- Victoria raised our rent.
- Great?

07:14.280 --> 07:15.960
I think you mispronounced
"terrible" again.

07:16.028 --> 07:17.194
Yes, the rent hike sucks,

07:17.296 --> 07:19.360
but what if I told
you that there is a way

07:19.385 --> 07:21.622
that we could not only pay our rent,

07:21.647 --> 07:22.905
but we could make enough money

07:22.930 --> 07:25.639
to escape Victoria Belfrey for good?

07:28.574 --> 07:31.074
So, your life-saving idea
is 50 pounds of flour?

07:31.176 --> 07:34.723
Mixed with 100 eggs
and 20 cups of sugar.

07:35.078 --> 07:38.309
I am talking about my beignets, "J."

07:38.438 --> 07:39.605
I mean, you know they're amazing,

07:39.629 --> 07:40.695
Lucy knows they're amazing,

07:40.719 --> 07:43.620
and once everyone else finds
out how amazing they are,

07:43.722 --> 07:45.289
we will be rich in no time.

07:45.391 --> 07:47.093
But we are not rich now.

07:47.118 --> 07:49.470
How did you pay for all of this?

07:50.048 --> 07:51.898
I may have dipped into the rent jar.

07:51.923 --> 07:52.804
Dipped?

07:52.829 --> 07:54.031
How much is a "dip"?

07:54.482 --> 07:57.311
A pinch or a dash?

07:57.736 --> 07:59.502
All of it.

08:09.580 --> 08:13.115
You are not going anywhere!

08:14.808 --> 08:17.142
I'm not going to some salt mine!

08:22.593 --> 08:23.557
Where'd you find him?

08:23.582 --> 08:25.594
Pleasure Island Cabaret.

08:27.698 --> 08:29.643
He was drunk and mouthy.

08:29.668 --> 08:32.791
Alcohol turns some
people into jackasses.

08:45.583 --> 08:46.648
Wait, You want to run

08:46.750 --> 08:48.450
your guerilla pastry
operation out of here?

08:48.552 --> 08:49.341
Unh-unh.

08:49.366 --> 08:51.039
No way. Louie...

08:51.114 --> 08:52.692
Louie is at a regional
managers convention

08:52.716 --> 08:54.397
trying to get lucky
with Cluck's on Sixth.

08:54.422 --> 08:55.499
He will never know.

08:55.524 --> 08:57.929
I can't invest in any
more of your crazy schemes.

08:57.954 --> 08:59.553
What crazy schemes?

09:01.451 --> 09:02.417
Okay, that's fair,

09:02.442 --> 09:04.025
but this... this is not one of them.

09:04.127 --> 09:06.127
You're a dreamer, and I love you for it,

09:06.152 --> 09:08.856
but I need a job, Belfrey off my case,

09:08.881 --> 09:10.832
and a real plan to get Lucy back.

09:10.901 --> 09:13.001
- This is too risky.
- Listen to me.

09:13.069 --> 09:14.435
Lucy is exactly the reason

09:14.504 --> 09:16.104
why you need to take this risk.

09:16.173 --> 09:18.056
It's time that we change the game

09:18.081 --> 09:19.978
and take a big swing for once.

09:20.033 --> 09:21.332
We owe it to ourselves.

09:21.357 --> 09:22.644
We owe it to Lucy.

09:22.712 --> 09:24.879
I love that girl like she is family,

09:24.981 --> 09:26.447
and when you love someone,

09:26.550 --> 09:28.683
you fight like hell for them.

09:30.737 --> 09:33.904
Come on. Let's make her proud.

09:36.275 --> 09:37.775
Okay.

09:38.147 --> 09:39.079
I'm with you.

09:39.104 --> 09:40.292
- Yeah?
- All right.

09:41.319 --> 09:42.281
Great.

09:42.306 --> 09:44.148
And with a little bit of sugar and spice

09:44.250 --> 09:45.282
and everything nice,

09:45.351 --> 09:47.451
we are going to show
that bitch who is boss.

10:09.479 --> 10:11.175
Excuse me.

10:11.244 --> 10:13.364
Do you know where I can find
the traveling soothsayer?

10:14.853 --> 10:16.486
Princess Tiana?

10:17.411 --> 10:18.714
Uh, no.

10:18.739 --> 10:19.979
You've come to help us at last!

10:20.019 --> 10:21.252
No, I'm... I'm sorry.

10:21.354 --> 10:22.653
I'm not who you think I am.

10:22.755 --> 10:23.988
A loaf of bread...

10:24.057 --> 10:26.090
- Princess Tiana.
- Please save us.

10:26.192 --> 10:27.224
I'm so sorry. I...

10:27.293 --> 10:28.793
- Please...
- I'm sorry. I...

10:30.263 --> 10:32.196
I can't... I can't help you.

10:32.298 --> 10:33.564
I'm so sorry.

10:33.633 --> 10:35.177
I believe the Princess
is here to see me,

10:35.201 --> 10:36.434
not you lot.

10:36.536 --> 10:37.536
Now scurry off,

10:37.603 --> 10:39.603
unless you'd rather slither or hop.

10:41.441 --> 10:43.908
Princess, enchantÃ©.

10:43.976 --> 10:45.876
A tip of the hat from Dr. Facilier.

11:09.753 --> 11:11.752
You've had quite a day, my dear.

11:11.777 --> 11:13.337
But no need to fret.

11:13.406 --> 11:15.752
There's a prince in your cards

11:15.777 --> 11:17.074
soon to be in your arms

11:17.176 --> 11:18.642
and... poof!

11:18.711 --> 11:20.778
All your troubles will evaporate.

11:20.880 --> 11:25.316
But how did you know I
was looking for a prince?

11:25.418 --> 11:27.218
It's my job, isn't it?

11:27.286 --> 11:29.920
And in this business, it's
all about who you know.

11:30.022 --> 11:31.138
I don't like to drop names,

11:31.163 --> 11:33.457
but I do have a few friends...

11:33.526 --> 11:34.825
on the other side.

11:34.927 --> 11:36.093
Friends?

11:36.195 --> 11:39.326
When I ask them a question, they answer.

11:41.754 --> 11:42.920
Do you see it?

11:44.381 --> 11:47.115
There's a story in the patterns,

11:47.140 --> 11:48.172
the story of a princess

11:48.274 --> 11:50.474
who grew up knowing
only wealth and ease.

11:50.576 --> 11:52.610
She had her father to thank for that,

11:52.712 --> 11:54.979
but then he passed
over to the other side,

11:55.081 --> 11:56.680
and the story turns darker.

12:01.821 --> 12:05.189
The King began to take more
and more from the people.

12:05.564 --> 12:08.249
The wealth dried up
like a raisin in the sun,

12:08.521 --> 12:11.529
and the people suffered
without a strong ruler.

12:14.834 --> 12:16.653
And that's why you've come to me,

12:16.678 --> 12:17.777
is it not?

12:17.874 --> 12:19.703
To find that strong ruler,

12:19.806 --> 12:21.672
that prince who can save
you and your kingdom.

12:21.774 --> 12:24.208
But I... I have nothing to pay you.

12:24.310 --> 12:26.888
A smile returning to that face will do.

12:27.341 --> 12:30.114
Consider it a discount
for a desperate soul.

12:35.230 --> 12:38.076
The path before you is
quite clear, Princess.

12:38.101 --> 12:41.054
You will find the prince you
seek on this very night...

12:41.320 --> 12:43.661
if you follow the red crow.

12:52.739 --> 12:55.172
I had to go to three
different herbalists

12:55.274 --> 12:57.741
and a sanctimonious hipster.

12:57.766 --> 12:59.710
Now I'm tragically
behind on my e-mails,

12:59.812 --> 13:02.052
and my hair smells like I
just got back from Burning Man.

13:03.074 --> 13:06.208
I'm not remotely
interested in your travails.

13:08.154 --> 13:10.487
Mother, where are you going with those?

13:10.556 --> 13:13.390
Where I'm going is
none of your business.

13:13.492 --> 13:15.292
And enough complaining.

13:15.394 --> 13:16.394
Don't think for a second

13:16.429 --> 13:18.029
that I wouldn't trade in my own daughter

13:18.097 --> 13:19.830
for an actual assistant.

13:20.142 --> 13:22.728
It's time you shut up

13:22.753 --> 13:24.510
and earn your job title.

13:57.103 --> 13:58.936
Henry, it's Ivy.

13:59.038 --> 14:01.845
Call me back if you still
want dirt on my mother.

14:01.876 --> 14:03.674
I have a pretty good
idea where to start.

14:16.564 --> 14:18.864
So, I think I got a lead

14:18.933 --> 14:20.781
on where we can dig up
some dirt on Belfrey.

14:20.806 --> 14:21.867
It came from Ivy.

14:21.936 --> 14:24.269
She said that Victoria has
been spending a lot of time

14:24.371 --> 14:25.704
in some secret room

14:25.773 --> 14:27.093
on the top floor of her building.

14:27.174 --> 14:29.374
I can't tell what's worse...

14:29.476 --> 14:30.587
the fact that you believe her

14:30.611 --> 14:34.576
or that... you're falling for her.

14:34.733 --> 14:36.715
Especially when there's a much better

14:36.740 --> 14:38.848
single-mother option
staring you in the face.

14:39.547 --> 14:42.421
- So, this is about Jacinda.
- No. This is about you.

14:42.489 --> 14:44.556
Henry, you're genuine.

14:44.625 --> 14:47.559
Ivy... isn't.

14:47.628 --> 14:49.795
I appreciate the Mama
Bear routine, okay?

14:49.863 --> 14:53.098
But the reality is, you aren't mine.

14:53.371 --> 14:55.300
Yeah, well, if your
mother were standing here,

14:55.369 --> 14:57.019
she'd tell you three things...

14:57.269 --> 14:59.371
get back to writing,

14:59.440 --> 15:01.540
take Jacinda on a date,

15:01.609 --> 15:04.009
and tip me well for
giving you the advice

15:04.078 --> 15:06.011
you so desperately need to hear.

15:09.999 --> 15:11.383
Where you going?

15:11.485 --> 15:13.185
Uh, to the bathroom...

15:13.254 --> 15:16.521
unless you feel compelled to
hold my hand in there, too.

15:26.209 --> 15:29.655
_

15:30.729 --> 15:33.896
_

15:33.921 --> 15:36.943
_

16:02.102 --> 16:03.904
Where is everyone coming from?

16:03.929 --> 16:05.304
Uh, I billed our venture

16:05.372 --> 16:07.172
as a one-time-only
pop-up on the GetGrub app.

16:07.241 --> 16:10.976
Mom always said nothin'
attracts a crowd like a crowd.

16:11.078 --> 16:12.577
Amazing!

16:12.646 --> 16:13.912
You're really doing it.

16:13.981 --> 16:14.813
I saw your pop-up ad

16:14.915 --> 16:16.348
on my ballet instructor's phone.

16:16.417 --> 16:17.567
What I won't be seeing is you

16:17.591 --> 16:19.743
if your grandma realizes
that you are here.

16:19.768 --> 16:20.734
Don't worry.

16:20.759 --> 16:22.220
I told Grandma ballet's going late

16:22.323 --> 16:24.423
so I could come be a part of your dream.

16:24.525 --> 16:27.926
In fact, I have a small addition to it.

16:33.444 --> 16:35.033
When we would make beignets,

16:35.135 --> 16:36.435
Sabine would tell me

16:36.537 --> 16:38.437
when she was my age, she was so poor

16:38.505 --> 16:40.472
she couldn't afford stars to wish on,

16:40.574 --> 16:41.973
so she wished on fireflies.

16:43.243 --> 16:44.562
I love it.

16:44.773 --> 16:46.011
I love it.

16:46.080 --> 16:48.543
You know, I want you to
stamp all of those bags

16:48.568 --> 16:50.235
as our new official logo.

16:52.929 --> 16:54.959
- Sabine, this could really work.
- Mm-hmm.

16:54.984 --> 16:57.290
And we could set up a stand
at the Sunday farmers' market.

16:57.315 --> 16:59.368
Oh, meh. Farmers' markets
are for Old MacDonald.

16:59.393 --> 17:01.093
No. I'm thinking jazz,

17:01.195 --> 17:02.127
luring people in

17:02.196 --> 17:04.529
to a popcorn-light-lit food truck.

17:04.554 --> 17:08.382
We park it at festivals and movie nights...
- Okay.

17:08.406 --> 17:10.435
And then serve Ã©touffÃ©e and boudin.

17:10.503 --> 17:12.604
- Buckets of these guys.
- Yes.

17:14.174 --> 17:15.678
Oh, it finally feels like

17:15.703 --> 17:16.920
we are headed in the right direction.

17:16.944 --> 17:19.211
Mm.

17:21.080 --> 17:22.646
That charlatan.

17:22.715 --> 17:25.183
There's no such thing as a red crow.

17:32.626 --> 17:34.359
Huh.

17:58.734 --> 18:02.587
Well, I guess the auction
fell short, Princess.

18:02.689 --> 18:03.928
But since you're here,

18:03.953 --> 18:05.473
I think I'll take those earrings

18:05.498 --> 18:07.098
at a severe discount.

18:10.444 --> 18:13.426
Why not bow and show some respect?

18:13.451 --> 18:15.210
Well, she's barely a princess.

18:15.505 --> 18:17.338
But she's still a lady, is she not?

18:17.363 --> 18:19.096
If no manners are shown,

18:19.121 --> 18:21.473
perhaps I'll hold my own auction.

18:21.714 --> 18:23.581
Your legs should get a few coins,

18:23.606 --> 18:26.440
seeing as they'll soon be half off.

18:35.322 --> 18:37.926
Prince Marias at your service.

18:37.951 --> 18:40.519
But please call me Robert.

18:42.229 --> 18:44.529
Well, I'm quite grateful
for you stepping in,

18:44.598 --> 18:48.233
but I'm afraid I'm not
deserving of all this

18:48.335 --> 18:49.267
from a nobleman.

18:49.336 --> 18:51.514
It's me who hopes to be deserving.

18:51.959 --> 18:54.306
To fend off a tipsy rogue is simple,

18:54.408 --> 18:56.708
but to learn what has
led our paths to cross,

18:56.810 --> 18:59.260
well, that requires a perilous path

18:59.285 --> 19:00.490
few are brave enough to take on

19:00.514 --> 19:01.913
in a tavern such as this.

19:05.265 --> 19:06.718
Dinner.

19:24.605 --> 19:26.671
Mmm.

19:26.773 --> 19:28.773
Mmm!

19:42.022 --> 19:44.155
Ralph, I have a job for you.

19:44.258 --> 19:46.958
You know that place selling beignets?

19:47.380 --> 19:48.646
Wreck it.

19:57.863 --> 19:59.262
You recognize that?

20:00.336 --> 20:01.668
Yeah.

20:01.948 --> 20:04.301
Ain't it the Seattle Mariners logo?

20:04.369 --> 20:05.902
You hit like a girl.

20:10.193 --> 20:13.810
That notebook is evidence
from a missing-persons case,

20:13.912 --> 20:15.612
a girl that disappeared 10 years ago...

20:15.681 --> 20:19.049
Eloise Gardener.

20:19.117 --> 20:20.529
Sound familiar?

20:20.554 --> 20:23.286
I was serving a sentence
down in Stafford Creek then.

20:24.214 --> 20:25.399
Is that so?

20:25.424 --> 20:27.390
Yeah. It's where I got the tattoo.

20:27.459 --> 20:29.292
Cellmate told me it wards off evil.

20:29.394 --> 20:30.894
You're a terrible liar.

20:30.919 --> 20:33.019
Bad things happen inside.

20:33.131 --> 20:35.398
You take whatever
protection you can get.

20:35.467 --> 20:37.834
Check my record.

20:41.540 --> 20:43.102
H-Hang on.

20:43.127 --> 20:45.375
I help you, and you're
leavin' me in the box?

20:45.444 --> 20:48.053
Mr. Coachman from the club
didn't want to press charges.

20:48.078 --> 20:50.914
Said it's more hassle than it's worth.

20:51.904 --> 20:53.350
You'll be out in 10.

20:54.089 --> 20:55.498
Hey, slugger?

20:57.022 --> 20:58.855
That's one powerful rune.

20:58.924 --> 21:01.091
If your lost girl was drawin' that,

21:01.159 --> 21:04.094
I'd hate to meet whatever
evil she was facing down.

21:15.024 --> 21:17.758
Oh, hey, thank you so
much for pushing me.

21:17.827 --> 21:19.126
I needed a nudge.

21:19.195 --> 21:21.095
Yeah, well, that's what best friends do.

21:21.164 --> 21:24.666
And I think today we proved
our business is on fire.

21:27.170 --> 21:29.103
Please let that not be literal.

21:29.939 --> 21:31.599
Oh, my God.

21:37.374 --> 21:38.685
Oh, my God.

21:47.256 --> 21:48.956
Come on, Sabine.

21:49.409 --> 21:51.392
Sabine!

21:58.701 --> 22:01.023
It's a beauty beyond words, Princess.

22:01.500 --> 22:03.937
Thank you for sharing.

22:05.508 --> 22:08.809
My father spent a lifetime
building this kingdom.

22:11.862 --> 22:13.683
Was this his?

22:13.708 --> 22:14.652
Yes.

22:14.677 --> 22:16.217
It's a Firefly Ruby.

22:16.285 --> 22:18.386
They awarded it to him after the war.

22:18.454 --> 22:20.354
He must have been quite the hero.

22:20.456 --> 22:22.923
He didn't start that way.

22:22.992 --> 22:24.688
He enlisted as a cook.

22:24.713 --> 22:26.894
But when the King's
horsemen took the camp,

22:26.963 --> 22:28.396
he was the only one left.

22:28.464 --> 22:30.965
He threw down his ladle
and picked up a sword.

22:31.034 --> 22:33.067
And it became the
turning point in the war.

22:33.169 --> 22:35.036
It's how he caught my mother's eye.

22:35.104 --> 22:37.938
Her love made him a Prince.

22:39.308 --> 22:40.808
After the war was won,

22:40.877 --> 22:43.625
he rebuilt her lands
into a great kingdom.

22:43.812 --> 22:45.746
Now we might lose it all.

22:46.840 --> 22:48.459
Not if I can help it.

22:50.753 --> 22:52.086
Tonight was magical.

22:52.506 --> 22:54.172
I'd like to see you again tomorrow.

22:54.757 --> 22:55.890
That would be nice.

23:06.380 --> 23:07.667
Stop right there.

23:09.839 --> 23:10.839
Ugh!

23:10.940 --> 23:11.940
Thief!

23:16.245 --> 23:17.778
I'm sorry. I had no other choice.

23:17.847 --> 23:19.288
It was Dr. Facilier. He made me.

23:19.313 --> 23:20.224
I didn't want to.

23:20.249 --> 23:21.649
Facilier?

23:21.751 --> 23:23.517
Why would I believe a prince would steal

23:23.542 --> 23:25.553
for a drifter magician?

23:25.636 --> 23:27.662
Because I'm not a prince.

23:28.006 --> 23:29.924
I'm just a commoner.

23:31.068 --> 23:32.801
He took my true love captive.

23:33.005 --> 23:35.842
He separated us in the cruelest of ways.

23:36.139 --> 23:40.701
I'm a man, and... my love is a frog.

23:42.042 --> 23:44.884
Facilier promised he would let her free.

23:44.909 --> 23:47.509
He said that true love's
kiss would break the curse

23:47.534 --> 23:48.620
and we could be together again

23:48.644 --> 23:50.511
if only I brought him that Firefly Ruby.

23:50.613 --> 23:52.079
No, there must be some other way,

23:52.181 --> 23:53.647
someone else who could help you.

23:53.716 --> 23:55.382
You've seen what it's like out there.

23:55.485 --> 23:57.318
Who else is there to turn to?

23:57.985 --> 23:59.062
Go.

23:59.087 --> 24:00.633
I don't ever want to
see your face again.

24:00.657 --> 24:01.657
Go!

24:27.383 --> 24:31.786
Dresses and hairbrushes?

24:31.888 --> 24:34.155
I've been so self-centered.

24:34.223 --> 24:37.191
I saw the world the same
way when I was your age.

24:37.260 --> 24:41.462
But, Mom, those people,
the beggars in Tent Alley

24:41.564 --> 24:44.598
and... and the man who
tried to take this from us.

24:44.700 --> 24:46.367
It was desperation.

24:46.469 --> 24:48.035
I've tried hard to protect you

24:48.137 --> 24:50.864
from the realities of what
the Kingdom has become.

24:51.064 --> 24:52.789
There was no way you could have known.

24:52.814 --> 24:55.142
So, what, we just look the other way?

24:57.313 --> 24:58.913
All your life,

24:58.981 --> 25:02.916
you've been told great stories
of your father's successes.

25:02.947 --> 25:05.152
- I failed to find someone like him...
- No.

25:07.890 --> 25:10.782
I failed you when I sent you looking.

25:11.336 --> 25:13.211
After the way you took action tonight,

25:13.236 --> 25:16.997
I realize we already
have everything we need,

25:17.430 --> 25:20.568
everything our people need.

25:21.482 --> 25:26.263
Your father's legacy
isn't this little prize.

25:27.109 --> 25:29.109
It's in you.

25:30.213 --> 25:31.545
All you have to do...

25:34.717 --> 25:36.116
is embrace it.

25:54.871 --> 25:56.270
Aunt Sabine!

25:59.208 --> 26:01.152
Mm! I was worried.

26:01.178 --> 26:02.326
It's okay. I'm gonna be fine.

26:02.350 --> 26:04.144
I'm just... I'm so
happy you weren't there.

26:04.247 --> 26:05.446
I need to talk to you.

26:05.514 --> 26:06.530
I know what you're gonna say,

26:06.554 --> 26:08.015
and I already have it figured out.

26:08.084 --> 26:10.864
- This was just a setback...
- A setback?

26:10.889 --> 26:12.061
Against my judgment,

26:12.086 --> 26:14.636
I let you convince me
to take this huge risk.

26:15.046 --> 26:16.246
And look what happened.

26:16.698 --> 26:18.058
Mom, please don't fight.

26:18.127 --> 26:19.860
I just want what's
best for you and Lucy.

26:19.962 --> 26:21.562
What is best is not giving people hope

26:21.664 --> 26:24.431
that life will get
better when it never does.

26:25.202 --> 26:26.546
You don't live in the
real world, Sabine,

26:26.570 --> 26:27.334
but I do.

26:27.436 --> 26:30.507
There isn't any room for
your crazy dreams anymore.

26:30.671 --> 26:33.007
She did this to try and help you, Mom,

26:33.445 --> 26:35.175
to try and help us.

26:35.278 --> 26:37.674
Yeah, well, if this is
help, I don't need it.

26:42.418 --> 26:43.918
Okay.

26:44.020 --> 26:46.213
If that's how you feel,
then you should take this.

26:46.353 --> 26:48.622
There's enough money in
there for two months' rent.

26:48.724 --> 26:51.926
Should be enough time for
you to find a new job...

26:52.028 --> 26:53.227
and a new roommate.

27:04.376 --> 27:06.610
Wait, please.

27:18.195 --> 27:20.407
You can put away the war paint.

27:20.865 --> 27:22.564
Henry's not coming.

27:22.883 --> 27:24.543
I decided to save him the trouble

27:24.568 --> 27:26.135
and stop this little game of yours

27:26.203 --> 27:27.102
before it starts.

27:27.204 --> 27:28.971
And what game is that exactly?

27:29.040 --> 27:30.339
Well, I don't know, Ivy.

27:30.408 --> 27:32.113
But if I had to guess,

27:32.138 --> 27:33.929
you're either trying
to piss your mother off,

27:33.954 --> 27:35.653
or you just want to take

27:35.678 --> 27:37.946
one more thing away from
your sister, Jacinda.

27:38.049 --> 27:39.214
Stepsister.

27:39.283 --> 27:41.717
And from what Henry told
me, there is nothing to take.

27:42.046 --> 27:43.346
Why are you so interested, anyway?

27:43.370 --> 27:44.153
You barely know him.

27:44.255 --> 27:46.388
I know him enough to
know he's a good kid.

27:46.457 --> 27:48.257
And I won't let you mess up his life.

27:48.359 --> 27:49.758
You might not believe this,

27:49.860 --> 27:52.541
but I have risked a
lot offering my help.

27:52.566 --> 27:54.396
If my mother finds out about this,

27:54.465 --> 27:56.365
I'll be cleaning her toilets.

27:56.467 --> 27:58.000
Like, for real.

27:58.102 --> 28:01.703
And I wouldn't risk that
just to stick it to Jacinda.

28:01.772 --> 28:04.506
Well, if you're so eager
to destroy your mother,

28:04.972 --> 28:05.972
prove it.

28:06.300 --> 28:08.577
Fine. I will.

28:09.374 --> 28:10.740
Follow me.

28:38.313 --> 28:39.508
Huh.

28:41.645 --> 28:43.479
She made me truck all over town

28:43.547 --> 28:45.898
for those disgusting herbs.

28:47.848 --> 28:49.447
They smelled like old feet.

28:50.454 --> 28:52.888
This wasn't just a tea party for one.

28:54.070 --> 28:55.267
Who was she with?

28:55.292 --> 28:56.625
I have no idea.

28:56.727 --> 28:58.026
Whenever mother comes up here,

28:58.129 --> 28:59.828
she's always alone.

29:02.103 --> 29:04.766
This is a strange place for tea,

29:05.971 --> 29:07.636
not exactly damning.

29:07.738 --> 29:08.748
If it makes you feel any better,

29:08.772 --> 29:10.706
I've wasted my time, too.

29:10.862 --> 29:13.831
Maybe not such a waste after all.

29:33.079 --> 29:34.963
- Where are you going to go?
- To my mom's.

29:35.065 --> 29:36.685
I'll crash on her couch.

29:37.576 --> 29:39.535
My mom didn't mean all
that stuff she said.

29:39.603 --> 29:42.224
- She was just upset.
- It's not just that.

29:42.249 --> 29:43.872
I can't make it here anymore.

29:43.941 --> 29:45.340
I'm trying, and I'm failing.

29:45.409 --> 29:46.642
That's not true.

29:46.744 --> 29:49.244
That's just what my
grandmother wants you to think.

29:49.313 --> 29:52.014
- But you can't give up on your dream.
- You know what?

29:52.082 --> 29:54.002
A lots of people have to
give up on their dreams,

29:54.051 --> 29:55.517
and sometimes bad guys win.

29:55.619 --> 29:56.685
At some point,

29:56.787 --> 29:58.720
we have to accept that and grow up.

29:58.822 --> 29:59.822
Grow up?

30:00.506 --> 30:02.061
This isn't growing up.

30:02.086 --> 30:03.425
It's running away.

30:05.196 --> 30:06.962
I'm sorry.

30:08.205 --> 30:09.237
It's just...

30:09.593 --> 30:11.767
you're supposed to be with us,

30:12.080 --> 30:13.890
like you always are.

30:14.373 --> 30:16.583
I need you, too.

30:17.336 --> 30:19.686
And you will always have me, okay, Luce?

30:19.711 --> 30:20.767
I promise.

30:20.943 --> 30:22.444
But there are some things in life

30:22.546 --> 30:25.147
that even I can't fight.

30:33.547 --> 30:35.814
Had a feeling I'd see you again.

30:38.173 --> 30:40.206
I know you want it, so take it.

30:40.231 --> 30:42.965
Get whatever pathetic
amount of gold you can.

30:43.033 --> 30:45.601
And in exchange, you want me to...?

30:45.669 --> 30:48.045
Hand over the woman you kidnapped.

30:48.070 --> 30:49.137
Ah.

30:50.374 --> 30:52.040
You mean her?

30:57.114 --> 30:59.848
That's quite a sacrifice
for a lowly frog.

31:00.190 --> 31:02.090
Do we have a deal or not?

31:03.921 --> 31:06.922
Such a powerful little thing, isn't it?

31:07.024 --> 31:08.450
First, it transformed your father

31:08.475 --> 31:12.127
from a cook into a prince.

31:12.196 --> 31:14.559
And now you... A sheltered princess

31:14.584 --> 31:15.897
into someone who would sacrifice

31:15.966 --> 31:18.634
for a man you don't even know.

31:18.736 --> 31:20.295
Quite the transformation.

31:22.239 --> 31:24.342
Nothing's "transformed" me.

31:24.756 --> 31:26.785
That's who I always was.

31:27.155 --> 31:29.044
I just didn't realize it.

31:30.014 --> 31:31.523
There's no magic in there.

31:31.548 --> 31:34.249
Oh, but there is.

31:34.318 --> 31:36.285
You see, I've been in a kind of prison,

31:36.353 --> 31:37.986
trapped with one foot in this world

31:38.055 --> 31:40.289
and one in a... a less pleasant place.

31:40.391 --> 31:44.626
And this ruby is going to set me free.

31:52.360 --> 31:53.979
So I'm going to keep this ruby

31:54.806 --> 31:57.839
and... my little frog.

32:00.244 --> 32:03.812
I've grown quite fond
of her sad, little cries.

32:03.914 --> 32:06.682
But as a gift for your
part in my liberation...

32:07.245 --> 32:10.475
I'll let you go... just this once.

32:11.689 --> 32:13.288
I'm not leaving without her.

32:17.588 --> 32:18.887
I'm glad to hear it.

32:22.084 --> 32:23.517
Oh...

32:24.707 --> 32:26.635
It feels so good to be back.

32:44.755 --> 32:46.922
I've already got the
best of this bargain.

32:49.558 --> 32:51.226
See you soon, Princess.

33:20.958 --> 33:22.524
Sabine, wait.

33:23.144 --> 33:26.027
Lucy called and talked
some sense into me.

33:26.370 --> 33:29.417
I'm sorry for all that
stupid stuff I said.

33:29.745 --> 33:30.745
Jacinda, don't.

33:31.313 --> 33:33.007
No, it's true.

33:33.032 --> 33:35.225
Every time this miserable
world gets me down,

33:35.250 --> 33:36.338
you pick me up.

33:36.440 --> 33:38.473
You help me find a way to fight.

33:38.575 --> 33:39.908
I guess I didn't realize

33:40.010 --> 33:43.211
that you needed me to do that for you

33:43.313 --> 33:45.195
every once in awhile.

33:45.828 --> 33:48.617
So... I'm gonna start...

33:49.070 --> 33:50.102
with that.

33:52.367 --> 33:54.222
What the hell is that?

33:54.609 --> 33:55.609
Come on.

33:58.877 --> 34:00.368
It's your food truck.

34:00.393 --> 34:03.131
Or our food truck...

34:03.233 --> 34:04.533
if you'll still have me.

34:05.236 --> 34:06.739
You bought a food truck?

34:07.471 --> 34:08.370
How?

34:08.438 --> 34:09.804
Detective Rogers helped out.

34:10.195 --> 34:12.717
And the impound lot has
some really good deals.

34:12.742 --> 34:14.509
So you used the money that I gave you,

34:14.610 --> 34:16.748
- the rent money?
- Yeah.

34:16.773 --> 34:18.956
I took a big swing, just
like you taught me...

34:18.982 --> 34:21.081
because you're right, Sabine.

34:21.185 --> 34:23.118
Because that is what best friends do.

34:23.496 --> 34:26.455
They nudge each other.

34:36.699 --> 34:37.866
Prince Marias.

34:39.056 --> 34:40.428
Wait.

34:40.453 --> 34:41.518
It's just me.

34:41.621 --> 34:43.768
- Have you come to arrest me?
- No.

34:44.717 --> 34:45.766
I have this.

34:48.960 --> 34:51.362
You got her!

34:51.429 --> 34:53.030
I'm sorry about before.

34:53.099 --> 34:54.197
I finally figured out

34:54.266 --> 34:57.134
I don't need a hero if I can be a hero.

34:57.280 --> 34:58.880
You sound like your father.

34:58.905 --> 35:01.038
Well, then it sounds like
I'm on the right path.

35:01.690 --> 35:03.707
The rumor is that the
King will be holding a ball

35:03.776 --> 35:05.470
to find his son a bride,

35:05.495 --> 35:06.869
which means his fortress of a castle

35:06.893 --> 35:08.179
will be open.

35:08.247 --> 35:09.814
I'm hoping to use that opportunity

35:09.916 --> 35:11.816
to turn the tide.

35:11.884 --> 35:13.651
Sounds like you've cooked up a plan.

35:13.753 --> 35:15.929
I was hoping that you and your ladylove

35:15.954 --> 35:17.188
could join me...

35:17.587 --> 35:18.533
That is, of course,

35:18.558 --> 35:21.826
once you deliver true love's kiss.

35:22.636 --> 35:26.066
Um... about my ladylove,

35:26.091 --> 35:29.730
I kind of misled you before.

35:30.003 --> 35:31.236
About what?

35:54.627 --> 35:56.360
Oh, and thank you.

35:56.683 --> 35:58.222
We'll never forget you.

36:21.927 --> 36:23.826
Huh.

36:24.450 --> 36:25.950
You're welcome.

36:42.875 --> 36:43.941
Hey there.

36:44.487 --> 36:45.820
Hi.

36:45.845 --> 36:46.845
- Those for me?
- Mm-hmm.

36:47.160 --> 36:48.456
The last of the beignets

36:48.481 --> 36:49.914
for you and your buddies.

36:50.016 --> 36:51.270
Jacinda told me

36:51.295 --> 36:53.195
- that you helped get us the food truck.
- No problem.

36:53.219 --> 36:56.120
It was part of this
month's impound auction.

36:56.188 --> 36:58.022
It was, uh, confiscated in a drug sting.

36:58.090 --> 36:59.890
You should clean it pretty thoroughly...

36:59.992 --> 37:01.191
Bleach, really high heat.

37:01.294 --> 37:03.127
We will. Thank you.

37:03.229 --> 37:04.328
I'm glad you came.

37:04.430 --> 37:05.474
The inspectors just finished.

37:05.498 --> 37:07.598
Whatever happened at Cluck's...

37:07.744 --> 37:09.744
- it was deliberate.
- What?

37:09.769 --> 37:11.001
The cameras were destroyed,

37:11.070 --> 37:13.370
so there's no luck there, I'm afraid.

37:13.751 --> 37:16.252
But I think we both have a
good idea who caused this.

37:18.778 --> 37:20.611
She didn't do it by herself, anyway.

37:20.680 --> 37:23.681
Might get a nasty smudge
on her tiny blazer.

37:23.749 --> 37:25.849
Sounds like we're both
talking about the same person.

37:25.952 --> 37:27.117
Mm-hmm.

37:36.243 --> 37:37.509
Hey. Yeah, it's me.

37:38.179 --> 37:39.730
We got a problem.

37:39.799 --> 37:41.828
Someone's looking for the girl.

37:55.614 --> 37:57.948
Mother, it seems like you had a bad day.

37:58.017 --> 38:00.298
I wanted to know if there was
anything I could do for you.

38:03.289 --> 38:05.422
Ivy, that's kind of you.

38:05.568 --> 38:07.635
I always rather liked the idea

38:07.660 --> 38:09.626
of raising a daughter,

38:09.729 --> 38:11.564
guiding her.

38:12.798 --> 38:14.372
And eventually there'd come a day

38:14.397 --> 38:15.544
where the roles would reverse,

38:15.568 --> 38:19.363
and she'd be there for me to lean on.

38:22.608 --> 38:24.066
But...

38:24.910 --> 38:27.344
not all daughters are created equal.

38:29.882 --> 38:32.349
It's embarrassing

38:32.451 --> 38:35.419
watching you flailing around, Ivy,

38:35.488 --> 38:36.553
not understanding

38:36.655 --> 38:38.856
all the things you're capable of,

38:39.697 --> 38:42.916
all the ways you're going to fall short.

38:44.663 --> 38:46.533
Think about it.

38:47.366 --> 38:49.333
And fix your makeup.

39:00.940 --> 39:02.212
Hey.

39:02.281 --> 39:03.347
You wanted to see me?

39:03.449 --> 39:04.948
Yes, I have something to show you,

39:05.051 --> 39:07.618
but first, um...

39:07.720 --> 39:11.755
listen, I answered a text
on your phone from Ivy

39:11.901 --> 39:13.740
and met her at Belfrey Tower.

39:13.765 --> 39:15.645
- Wait, wait, wait, wait. What? You...
- I know.

39:15.694 --> 39:17.261
It was wrong.

39:17.363 --> 39:19.817
I just wanted to know
if we could trust her.

39:20.247 --> 39:21.965
Well, so, can we?

39:22.034 --> 39:22.766
Maybe.

39:22.868 --> 39:24.301
But that's not important,

39:24.403 --> 39:26.603
because while we were in there...

39:28.908 --> 39:30.107
I found this.

39:31.944 --> 39:33.811
I have no idea where that is.

39:33.879 --> 39:36.113
And I have never owned
clothes like those

39:36.215 --> 39:38.048
in my life.

39:38.150 --> 39:40.384
Plus, I have no idea who that kid is.

39:41.397 --> 39:42.970
I do.

39:46.395 --> 39:47.794
That's me.

40:10.249 --> 40:11.615
Hello?

40:20.826 --> 40:21.826
Aah!

40:22.995 --> 40:24.094
Damn it!

40:24.196 --> 40:26.530
Seriously? Lurk much?

40:27.666 --> 40:29.700
You're the one that asked me to hide.

40:29.725 --> 40:31.925
From her, from Roni.

40:33.038 --> 40:35.339
You scared the hell out of me.

40:37.843 --> 40:39.543
We really need to find you a stylist.

40:39.645 --> 40:42.117
Did it work?

40:42.523 --> 40:45.816
- Do they trust you?
- Yes. Of course.

40:45.918 --> 40:48.652
They might even trust me
as much as Mother does...

40:48.929 --> 40:50.164
fool that she is.

40:50.189 --> 40:53.323
Your mother thinks
she sees and knows all.

40:53.425 --> 40:54.992
You did a good job at convincing her

40:55.094 --> 40:56.226
she's in charge.

40:56.406 --> 40:57.505
What can I say?

40:57.530 --> 40:59.062
I'm a clever girl.

41:00.099 --> 41:01.667
And a good one, too.

41:01.692 --> 41:05.736
She may not see that, but I do.

41:08.674 --> 41:09.918
Well, when she comes back up here,

41:09.942 --> 41:12.576
tell her that you broke this

41:12.678 --> 41:14.645
and demand that she make
you more of your brew

41:14.670 --> 41:17.694
and just play the
charade out until the end.

41:17.719 --> 41:22.152
My sweet Ivy, you
know I'll do just that.

41:22.461 --> 41:23.954
Good.

41:24.056 --> 41:26.190
And don't call me "Ivy."

41:26.292 --> 41:27.591
It's Drizella.
