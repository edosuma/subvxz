WEBVTT

00:01.500 --> 00:04.417
[dramatic music]

00:11.958 --> 00:14.917
As reports continue to come in
about the harsh conditions

00:15.000 --> 00:19.250
aboard what was once the shining
beacon of Earthforce, Babylon 5

00:19.333 --> 00:22.167
messages smuggled out
indicate that humans continue

00:22.250 --> 00:24.083
to be subjected
to cruel oppression

00:24.167 --> 00:27.125
'by alien groups
aboard the renegade outpost'

00:27.208 --> 00:29.333
'and every day
more people are asking'

00:29.417 --> 00:31.375
'"When will Earth intervene?'

00:31.458 --> 00:33.583
'"How much longer can
we allow our citizens'

00:33.667 --> 00:35.583
'to endure this mistreatment?"'

00:35.667 --> 00:37.292
Why do you keep
watching that garbage?

00:37.375 --> 00:38.500
You know it just upsets you.

00:38.583 --> 00:39.917
I'm gathering intelligence.

00:40.000 --> 00:41.833
You're winding yourself up
like a cheap watch.

00:41.917 --> 00:43.958
It helps me focus.

00:44.042 --> 00:46.458
You heard that part
about intervention?

00:46.542 --> 00:48.500
'They are laying a foundation
for another assault'

00:48.583 --> 00:51.292
only this time
it will look like a, uh

00:51.375 --> 00:53.833
a rescue mission
instead of an unprovoked attack.

00:53.917 --> 00:55.292
So how long until they move?

00:55.375 --> 00:56.958
I don't know.

00:57.042 --> 00:58.500
Not for a while yet.

00:58.583 --> 01:00.792
They'll keep the war drums
going as long as they can

01:00.875 --> 01:03.417
whip everyone up back home,
turn them against us.

01:03.500 --> 01:05.542
- 'Commander.'
- Thanks.

01:05.625 --> 01:07.708
We're getting a signal
from Dr. Franklin on Mars.

01:07.792 --> 01:10.125
It's weak. It's barely
even getting past the jammers.

01:10.208 --> 01:12.667
Uh, put it through.

01:12.750 --> 01:15.625
I repeat, this is lost lamb
to big, bad wolf.

01:15.708 --> 01:19.208
Do not respond.
I repeat, do not respond.

01:19.292 --> 01:21.375
We have arranged
a meeting with the board

01:21.458 --> 01:23.083
who send its regards.

01:30.042 --> 01:33.375
We are continuing on schedule
and hope to come home soon.

01:33.458 --> 01:35.667
We will check in again
at pre-arranged time

01:35.750 --> 01:37.583
on second coded frequency.

01:37.667 --> 01:40.375
on.

01:42.417 --> 01:45.292
Well, that was good and cryptic.

01:45.375 --> 01:48.042
Well, keeping the transmission
short cuts down on the risk

01:48.125 --> 01:49.875
of it being tracked back here

01:49.958 --> 01:51.875
and as long as
Babylon 5 doesn't respond

01:51.958 --> 01:55.083
there's no way anyone can know
who the message was meant for.

01:55.167 --> 01:57.917
If Clark knew that someone
from Babylon 5 was here..

01:58.000 --> 02:00.917
- He'd go fusion.
- Oh, big time.

02:01.000 --> 02:03.833
The important thing is,
the captain knows we're set

02:03.917 --> 02:05.042
to meet with the rest
of the Resistance

02:05.125 --> 02:06.708
as soon as they arrive.

02:08.292 --> 02:10.167
I hope it does some good.

02:11.917 --> 02:15.083
Some of the others
aren't as reasonable as I am.

02:16.625 --> 02:18.583
In case you hadn't noticed,
Earthforce

02:18.667 --> 02:21.000
is closing
the noose around us.

02:21.083 --> 02:22.625
We estimate they'll capture
the rest of Mars

02:22.708 --> 02:26.292
by the end of the year,
unless something is done.

02:26.375 --> 02:27.875
I'm worried some
of the others will start

02:27.958 --> 02:29.208
getting more aggressive.

02:29.292 --> 02:31.250
Stephen,
there's been an explosion

02:31.333 --> 02:34.167
at the Red Planet Hotel,
took out a security force

02:34.250 --> 02:35.375
from Earth.

02:35.458 --> 02:36.750
'They say
it's a terrorist attack'

02:36.833 --> 02:38.083
by the Resistance.

02:38.167 --> 02:40.667
Ten civilians
were killed in the attack.

02:50.833 --> 02:52.375
And also,
there have been more attacks

02:52.458 --> 02:54.708
against transport ships
along our border, Delenn.

02:54.792 --> 02:57.542
Not against our own ships,
but the smaller world

02:57.625 --> 02:59.292
we've been aligned
for centuries.

02:59.375 --> 03:01.208
The Norsai have been
the hardest hit.

03:01.292 --> 03:03.208
But we have always
guaranteed their protection.

03:03.292 --> 03:05.750
Why haven't our ships been sent
to help them?

03:05.833 --> 03:08.083
With the Grey Council no more

03:08.167 --> 03:09.417
the three castes
are mainly concerned

03:09.500 --> 03:11.500
with protecting
their own interests.

03:11.583 --> 03:13.792
The Alliance Norsai
was initiated

03:13.875 --> 03:15.500
by the Religious Caste.

03:15.583 --> 03:17.333
Now that the war is over..

03:17.417 --> 03:19.625
...the Warrior Caste
are refusing to help.

03:19.708 --> 03:21.625
Do you know who's responsible
for these attacks?

03:21.708 --> 03:25.083
No. So we have sent
for more information.

03:25.167 --> 03:26.958
Perhaps the situation
is not as bad as

03:27.042 --> 03:28.917
the reports have indicated.

03:31.500 --> 03:34.542
[intense music]

03:48.917 --> 03:50.542
(Lennier)
It was the year of fire.

03:50.625 --> 03:52.708
(Zack)
The year of destruction.

03:52.792 --> 03:55.625
(G'Kar)
The year we took back
what was ours.

03:55.708 --> 03:57.625
(Lyta)
It was the year of rebirth.

03:57.708 --> 03:59.917
(Vir)
The year of great sadness.

04:00.000 --> 04:01.500
(Marcus)
The year of pain.

04:01.583 --> 04:03.375
(Delenn)
And the year of joy.

04:03.458 --> 04:05.042
(Londo)
It was a new age.

04:05.125 --> 04:06.917
(Franklin)
It was the end of history.

04:07.000 --> 04:10.083
(Ivanova)
It was the year
everything changed.

04:12.417 --> 04:14.917
(Garibaldi)
The year is 2261.

04:15.000 --> 04:16.333
The place..

04:16.417 --> 04:18.125
(Sheridan)
Babylon 5.

04:18.208 --> 04:21.250
[theme music]

04:51.208 --> 04:54.292
[music continues]

05:14.958 --> 05:17.875
[instrumental music]

05:28.958 --> 05:30.000
John.

05:30.083 --> 05:31.458
Delenn,
I was just about to call you.

05:31.542 --> 05:33.708
I was wondering if you'd like
to have dinner tonight.

05:33.792 --> 05:35.125
- I can't.
- What?

05:35.208 --> 05:36.792
Lately, there have been
a number of attacks

05:36.875 --> 05:39.958
against several worlds
on the border of Minbari space.

05:40.042 --> 05:41.792
Since the Warrior Caste
will not act

05:41.875 --> 05:43.208
I have to look into it.

05:43.292 --> 05:45.000
Oh, that's interesting timing.

05:45.083 --> 05:48.625
There have been similar attacks
outside Pak'ma'ra space.

05:48.708 --> 05:50.750
And I guess it was inevitable.

05:50.833 --> 05:53.333
Everyone suffered
heavy losses during the war.

05:53.417 --> 05:54.958
It was only a matter of time
before someone tried

05:55.042 --> 05:57.458
to take advantage of that
by sending out raiding parties.

05:57.542 --> 06:00.083
But to attack
without provocation.

06:00.167 --> 06:02.542
The Norsai are
a peaceful Agrarian people

06:02.625 --> 06:04.917
who have relied
on our protection for centuries.

06:05.000 --> 06:06.833
So I'm going
to take out the flight

06:06.917 --> 06:09.250
of White Star ships
to investigate.

06:09.333 --> 06:12.167
Since it was a Religious Caste
that promised them protection

06:12.250 --> 06:14.875
I have an obligation.

06:14.958 --> 06:16.958
Well, can't you send out
Lennier?

06:17.042 --> 06:18.625
It might be dangerous.

06:18.708 --> 06:21.792
John, it pleases me
that you care

06:21.875 --> 06:24.000
for what I have become..

06:24.083 --> 06:27.167
...but never forget who I was

06:27.250 --> 06:29.708
what I am, and what I can do.

06:33.833 --> 06:35.458
You're right.

06:37.208 --> 06:38.833
Alright. Go ahead.

06:40.042 --> 06:41.958
I'll see you
when you get back.

06:42.042 --> 06:44.125
[instrumental music]

06:58.792 --> 07:00.750
(Phillipe)
We have to let
Donovan know everything

07:00.833 --> 07:02.500
went according to plan,
do you understand?

07:02.583 --> 07:04.000
What have you done..

07:04.083 --> 07:05.875
What? What did I do?

07:05.958 --> 07:07.292
Out! This is private.

07:07.375 --> 07:09.292
- 'What did I do?'
- Out!

07:10.542 --> 07:11.958
You know damn well
what you did.

07:12.042 --> 07:13.625
That bombing was unauthorized.

07:13.708 --> 07:14.792
I checked with Donovan!

07:14.875 --> 07:16.375
Donovan's Earthside!

07:16.458 --> 07:18.833
Whatever he may think,
he doesn't run the Resistance.

07:18.917 --> 07:21.125
Mars is my territory,
and you don't pull

07:21.208 --> 07:22.917
this kind of crap
without authorization.

07:23.000 --> 07:25.042
I saw the security squad
checkin' in.

07:25.125 --> 07:26.833
There wasn't time!

07:26.917 --> 07:29.083
A call takes ten seconds.

07:29.167 --> 07:31.750
Do you know what I can do
to you in ten seconds?

07:31.833 --> 07:34.250
In ten seconds,
I can cripple you for life.

07:34.333 --> 07:36.167
In ten seconds,
I can break your skull open

07:36.250 --> 07:38.500
and scoop out your brains
food!

07:38.583 --> 07:42.375
civilians
on the deck, Phillipe

07:42.458 --> 07:44.417
and they're going
to hold me responsible.

07:44.500 --> 07:47.583
They'll be looking for me
long after you go home to Earth.

07:47.667 --> 07:50.125
I don't care
what you do back home

07:50.208 --> 07:53.292
but here, you answer to me,
and you don't do anything.

07:53.375 --> 07:55.667
You don't breathe,
you don't move

07:55.750 --> 07:59.250
and you don't blow things up
unless you check with me first!

07:59.333 --> 08:01.417
Clear?

08:03.125 --> 08:05.042
Tell me,
is this how you treat

08:05.125 --> 08:06.375
all your former lovers?

08:06.458 --> 08:08.542
As a matter of fact, yes.

08:12.125 --> 08:15.917
Whatever you've got to say,
it damn well better be worth it.

08:16.000 --> 08:18.292
- Huh!
- Looks upset.

08:18.375 --> 08:20.167
- Think it's something we said?
- Hope not.

08:20.250 --> 08:22.417
I'd sooner face
an entire shadow fleet

08:22.500 --> 08:24.583
than what just walked past us.

08:24.667 --> 08:26.500
[yawns]

08:27.833 --> 08:29.250
Sorry.

08:29.333 --> 08:31.583
Still can't get used
to the time difference here.

08:31.667 --> 08:34.542
Must be past midnight
back at the station

08:34.625 --> 08:37.333
everybody all asleep
in their beds.

08:47.875 --> 08:50.083
At which time,
we hope to present a series

08:50.167 --> 08:53.750
on Minbari War syndrome,
and examine how it can affect

08:53.833 --> 08:55.708
some of our war veterans.

08:55.792 --> 08:58.625
They will explain how someone
with as noted a reputation

08:58.708 --> 09:02.083
as Captain Sheridan could go
from war hero

09:02.167 --> 09:05.667
to alien collaborator
without realizing the damage

09:05.750 --> 09:07.250
he's doing to his own world.

09:07.333 --> 09:09.667
Up yours,
you lying sack of..

09:09.750 --> 09:11.792
..our continuing report,
we will examine

09:11.875 --> 09:14.458
in greater detail
the mistreatment of humans

09:14.542 --> 09:16.625
trapped on Babylon 5.

09:16.708 --> 09:20.583
Our job, as always,
is simply to state the facts

09:20.667 --> 09:23.167
and let the truth attend
to itself.

09:39.792 --> 09:41.000
[doorbell beeps]

09:42.000 --> 09:43.792
Leave me alone.

09:43.875 --> 09:45.792
[doorbell beeping]

09:45.875 --> 09:48.250
[sighs]
Can't I get just one night

09:48.333 --> 09:50.667
of uninterrupted
sleep around here?

09:52.042 --> 09:54.042
Aah!

09:56.417 --> 09:58.000
[sighs]
Lights.

09:58.083 --> 10:00.083
Low.

10:00.167 --> 10:02.292
- Yes?
- 'Susan, it's me.'

10:02.375 --> 10:04.167
Open.

10:04.250 --> 10:06.167
I've got it.
Dammit, Susan, I've got it!

10:06.250 --> 10:07.500
What?

10:07.583 --> 10:09.667
Look, if they
wanna play games, well, fine.

10:09.750 --> 10:12.083
We can play games too,
only we can play 'em better

10:12.167 --> 10:14.000
because we've got
the truth on our side.

10:14.083 --> 10:15.750
You can't kill the truth.

10:16.958 --> 10:18.750
Actually,
you can kill the truth

10:18.833 --> 10:20.583
but it always comes back
to haunt you later.

10:20.667 --> 10:22.375
- Hello?
- Come on. I'll show you.

10:22.458 --> 10:23.500
I, I think
we can make this work.

10:23.583 --> 10:25.500
- Uh, John?
- What?

10:25.583 --> 10:28.292
Uh, don't you think
I better change first?

10:30.125 --> 10:32.375
Oh, yeah. Right.
Uh, sorry.

10:32.458 --> 10:34.125
I, I hadn't noticed.

10:34.208 --> 10:36.625
Thanks, I'll just..
Wait a minute.

10:36.708 --> 10:38.667
What do you mean
you didn't notice?

10:38.750 --> 10:40.542
I mean,
what am I, chopped flarn?

10:40.625 --> 10:42.125
I mean, okay, granted

10:42.208 --> 10:43.417
I don't have
any interest in you

10:43.500 --> 10:44.708
you don't have
any interest in me

10:44.792 --> 10:46.250
but if you're gonna come
barging in here

10:46.333 --> 10:47.625
in the middle of the night,
the least you could say

10:47.708 --> 10:49.917
is, "Nice outfit, Ivanova"

10:50.000 --> 10:52.083
and then go on a tear.

10:52.167 --> 10:54.542
Yeah, uh,
nice outfit, Ivanova.

10:56.000 --> 10:57.375
You are such a..

10:58.792 --> 11:00.625
[mumbling]

11:03.833 --> 11:06.708
Yeah. Yeah, this will work.

11:06.792 --> 11:08.458
John, I've been here before.

11:08.542 --> 11:09.625
For this, you woke me up?

11:09.708 --> 11:12.708
Why not?
You gave me the idea.

11:12.792 --> 11:14.833
Look, I'm, I'm just gonna sit
over here until you tell me

11:14.917 --> 11:16.375
what the hell
you're talking about.

11:16.458 --> 11:18.083
During the last
phase of the war

11:18.167 --> 11:20.125
you were on the BabCom system

11:20.208 --> 11:23.375
updating everyone
on evacuations, safe zones

11:23.458 --> 11:25.583
rescues,
which planets had fallen.

11:25.667 --> 11:27.167
Yes, I know. I hated it.

11:27.250 --> 11:29.292
You were great at it.

11:29.375 --> 11:32.375
'You have a face people trust.'

11:32.458 --> 11:34.333
I'd rather
have a face people fear.

11:34.417 --> 11:37.042
[sighs]
Well, that too, but see

11:37.125 --> 11:39.458
it occurred to me
that if we could do that here

11:39.542 --> 11:42.292
on a small scale,
why not on a larger scale?

11:43.750 --> 11:46.292
I mean, ever since
we broke away from Earth

11:46.375 --> 11:51.250
solid information has been
rare as gold.

11:51.333 --> 11:53.833
We had to rely
on smuggled data crystals

11:53.917 --> 11:55.542
rumors, stories.

11:55.625 --> 11:57.292
'All they have to go
on back home'

11:57.375 --> 11:59.375
'is what ISN tells them.'

11:59.458 --> 12:04.042
So, why not solve
two problems at the same time?

12:04.125 --> 12:06.000
Why not come up
with a way that we can turn

12:06.083 --> 12:10.000
the War Room into,
I don't know, uh..

12:11.833 --> 12:14.125
The voice of the Resistance.

12:16.208 --> 12:19.542
Susan, during World War II,
the French Resistance

12:19.625 --> 12:21.667
used to go on the air
for one hour a night

12:21.750 --> 12:23.292
always
from a different location

12:23.375 --> 12:26.208
broadcasting the real news
about the war

12:26.292 --> 12:28.250
'providing intelligence
for the resistance fighters'

12:28.333 --> 12:30.625
encouraging
the Germans to defect.

12:30.708 --> 12:33.000
Well, why can't we do
the same thing here?

12:33.083 --> 12:34.375
Why do I get
the ugly suspicion

12:34.458 --> 12:36.417
that you're volunteering me
for this job?

12:37.792 --> 12:39.792
I accept your offer.

12:39.875 --> 12:41.208
Now, you go get some sleep

12:41.292 --> 12:43.708
and we will talk
about this again tomorrow.

12:43.792 --> 12:45.375
[sighs]

12:48.375 --> 12:49.958
If he weren't
my commanding officer

12:50.042 --> 12:52.000
I swear I'd shoot him dead.

13:13.250 --> 13:15.125
You've been up
for some time, Delenn.

13:16.167 --> 13:17.500
You should sleep.

13:17.583 --> 13:19.417
I will.

13:19.500 --> 13:21.375
I was thinking.

13:21.458 --> 13:23.042
I'm very disturbed
by what you told me

13:23.125 --> 13:25.625
about the Warrior Caste.

13:25.708 --> 13:27.375
Since the war,
I haven't been paying

13:27.458 --> 13:29.417
as much attention
to the events back home

13:29.500 --> 13:31.583
as I should have.

13:31.667 --> 13:33.208
How is it?

13:33.292 --> 13:35.667
The Grey Council was the force
that held us together, Delenn.

13:36.667 --> 13:38.875
That is why Valen created it.

13:38.958 --> 13:41.250
Each caste
had an equal voice.

13:42.417 --> 13:44.667
Without it,
it has become difficult

13:44.750 --> 13:46.917
and there have been rumors.

13:47.000 --> 13:48.375
It is said
that the Warrior Caste

13:48.458 --> 13:51.250
are trying to form
a new council of its own.

13:51.333 --> 13:54.000
I've heard in the cities
of Sikar and Dronya

13:54.083 --> 13:56.875
where once the three castes
lived together peacefully.

13:56.958 --> 13:59.625
The Warrior Caste
have forced out our caste

13:59.708 --> 14:01.750
driving them
to the wastelands.

14:02.875 --> 14:05.458
'At least, that is the rumor.'

14:05.542 --> 14:07.417
Do you believe it?

14:07.500 --> 14:09.208
Dukhat says,
when there is good news

14:09.292 --> 14:10.792
we always ask if it is true

14:10.875 --> 14:13.542
because it is so difficult
to believe.

14:13.625 --> 14:15.625
But when there is bad news,
we rarely inquire

14:15.708 --> 14:17.625
because it is so easy
to believe.

14:18.667 --> 14:22.250
So, yes, Delenn, I do believe

14:22.333 --> 14:24.875
'but I very much wish
that I did not.'

14:48.542 --> 14:50.667
Alright, I want to thank
all of you for coming.

14:50.750 --> 14:53.292
I know that getting here
was difficult for most of you

14:53.375 --> 14:55.083
considering the extent
to which President Clark

14:55.167 --> 14:57.625
has been restricting travel.

14:57.708 --> 15:00.833
Captain Sheridan has asked me
to convey several messages.

15:00.917 --> 15:03.708
First, to express
the outrage we all feel

15:03.792 --> 15:04.958
about how Mars
has been treated.

15:05.042 --> 15:05.958
I guess so.

15:06.042 --> 15:07.500
'Now, it was Clark's decision'

15:07.583 --> 15:10.292
'to bomb civilian targets
that prompted our decision'

15:10.375 --> 15:12.000
to secede from the Alliance.

15:12.083 --> 15:15.125
That and a small fleet
of ships coming your way.

15:15.208 --> 15:17.917
It's just a little easier
to make the grand gesture

15:18.042 --> 15:20.667
when someone is pointing a gun
at your head. Yes?

15:20.750 --> 15:22.292
Now, that's just not fair!

15:22.375 --> 15:24.375
No one's forgotten
that Sheridan helped put down

15:24.458 --> 15:26.667
the food riots
after the Minbari War.

15:26.750 --> 15:29.083
A lot of people here
still haven't forgotten that.

15:29.167 --> 15:31.667
The point is the captain

15:31.750 --> 15:34.375
is willing to set aside
all differences

15:34.458 --> 15:37.500
and focus on what needs
to be done now.

15:37.583 --> 15:39.875
And right now you need
all the allies you can get.

15:39.958 --> 15:41.667
He wants you to know
that we have not forgotten

15:41.750 --> 15:44.167
Mars or Proxima III.

15:44.250 --> 15:45.792
We are putting together
a coalition that will

15:45.875 --> 15:47.958
move against Clark
at the appropriate time

15:48.042 --> 15:50.000
and he wants your support..

15:50.083 --> 15:52.167
...provided that you do
understand that this is directed

15:52.250 --> 15:54.000
against the person,
not the position.

15:54.083 --> 15:56.833
I know, what are you taking
us for? What are you selling?

15:56.917 --> 15:59.625
Some of you
want to overthrow EarthGov

15:59.708 --> 16:02.042
as payment
for what it's done to you.

16:02.125 --> 16:03.417
Fair enough.

16:03.500 --> 16:05.542
I was raised on Arisia colony

16:05.625 --> 16:07.875
which was sucked dry
by Earth taxes and ruined

16:07.958 --> 16:11.417
by Earth corporations,
so I sympathize

16:11.500 --> 16:14.750
but if you go that way,
you'll lose any support

16:14.833 --> 16:16.875
you might have back home
and jeopardize

16:16.958 --> 16:19.458
the greater mission,
getting rid of Clark.

16:19.542 --> 16:22.542
Now, towards that end,
the captain wants you to stop

16:22.625 --> 16:23.750
bombing civilian targets.

16:23.833 --> 16:25.542
It does no good,
and it never has.

16:25.625 --> 16:27.458
We have to send a message!

16:27.542 --> 16:30.250
You are! You are,
but it's the wrong message!

16:30.333 --> 16:32.042
It makes everyone
back home more sympathetic

16:32.125 --> 16:33.708
to Clark's position.

16:33.792 --> 16:36.458
You're driving people away
be trying

16:36.542 --> 16:38.250
to bring them around
to our side.

16:38.333 --> 16:40.375
You talk about our side,
but we haven't seen much help

16:40.458 --> 16:42.250
coming from Babylon 5 lately.

16:42.333 --> 16:43.750
[indistinct chattering]

16:43.833 --> 16:46.833
Sorry, been a trifle busy
lately with a little war

16:46.917 --> 16:50.000
that threatened to wipe out
this entire sector

16:50.083 --> 16:54.042
and before you think
it's got nothing to do with you

16:54.125 --> 16:57.000
the creature we found
on one of your people

16:57.083 --> 16:59.792
when we got here
would seem to indicate

16:59.875 --> 17:02.417
that the forces
behind that war

17:02.500 --> 17:05.542
are also responsible
for some of the problems here.

17:05.625 --> 17:07.375
Now, we need to know
that we can rely on you

17:07.458 --> 17:10.458
to carry out any instruction
from Babylon 5

17:10.542 --> 17:12.417
over the next several months
without question

17:12.500 --> 17:14.417
no matter how strange
they may sound.

17:14.500 --> 17:17.583
We need you to trust us,
and we need you to be patient.

17:17.667 --> 17:20.750
Hold off on the bombings
for a while.

17:20.833 --> 17:22.917
Is that all you have to say?

17:26.208 --> 17:28.333
No.

17:28.417 --> 17:32.000
Captain Sheridan
gave me one last message.

17:32.083 --> 17:34.833
He said, I know we are asking
a great deal of you

17:34.917 --> 17:36.792
but in exchange
for your cooperation

17:36.875 --> 17:39.042
you have my guarantee
that when this is all over

17:39.125 --> 17:42.458
Mars will finally be recognized
as an independent state.

17:42.542 --> 17:44.792
And we're supposed to believe
one man saying this?

17:44.875 --> 17:47.250
- Yes! If it's the right man.
- Oh, yeah!

17:47.333 --> 17:48.708
And what if I said
I'd sprout wings

17:48.792 --> 17:50.875
and fly to New York, huh?

17:50.958 --> 17:52.958
In your case,
I'd say you were crazy

17:53.042 --> 17:55.292
but if Sheridan said it,
I'd tell him to stop off

17:55.375 --> 17:58.875
on the west side
and pick me up some bagels!

17:58.958 --> 18:01.125
This is what you have been
fighting and dying for

18:01.208 --> 18:05.000
and you are no closer
to your goal now than before!

18:05.083 --> 18:07.500
Clark's forces
will keep closing in on you

18:07.583 --> 18:09.042
whether you sign up
with us or not

18:09.125 --> 18:11.875
and in six months,
dead!

18:13.083 --> 18:15.667
Now, we're
offering you a chance.

18:15.750 --> 18:18.000
We'll give you support
and a real target

18:18.083 --> 18:20.667
which is a hell of a lot better
than bombing civilian targets

18:20.750 --> 18:22.667
on your way to the gallows.

18:34.875 --> 18:36.542
This is the location
where most of the attacks

18:36.625 --> 18:37.792
have taken place.

18:37.875 --> 18:39.167
Are you receiving anything,
Lennier?

18:39.250 --> 18:40.958
I'm picking up
a distress signal.

18:41.042 --> 18:43.750
Scanners indicate it's
a Pak'ma'ra military transport.

18:43.833 --> 18:46.083
Put us on course.
Do we have visual?

18:47.250 --> 18:49.042
Putting it through.

18:49.125 --> 18:50.917
[indistinct chatter]

18:51.625 --> 18:52.708
Translate.

18:52.792 --> 18:54.750
(ailen)
'Winshakarr to any ships'

18:54.833 --> 18:58.042
'are being attacked.
Please help!'

18:58.125 --> 19:00.458
All ships, attack formation!

19:00.542 --> 19:03.583
[intense music]

19:08.458 --> 19:09.750
Engines hit.

19:09.833 --> 19:12.333
Life support
no longer functioning.

19:12.417 --> 19:13.750
Dark enemy.

19:15.125 --> 19:17.875
This is Delenn of the Minbari.
We are en route.

19:17.958 --> 19:19.458
How many ships
are attacking you?

19:19.542 --> 19:22.208
Too many. Too many.

19:22.292 --> 19:24.125
[static]

19:25.125 --> 19:26.625
It's gone.

19:26.708 --> 19:29.833
Are we close enough to pick up
the ships that attacked it?

19:29.917 --> 19:31.417
Yes.

19:31.500 --> 19:32.875
On-screen.

19:35.542 --> 19:38.583
[dramatic music]

19:44.667 --> 19:46.208
Be careful, Delenn.

19:46.292 --> 19:48.042
We don't know
the reasons for the attack

19:48.125 --> 19:49.917
and we've never seen any ships
like those before.

19:50.000 --> 19:53.417
I was there at the first contact
with Dukhat, Lennier.

19:53.500 --> 19:55.625
Do not make
such mistakes twice.

19:55.708 --> 19:57.292
Open a channel.

20:00.417 --> 20:02.667
White Star fleet
to attacking ships.

20:02.750 --> 20:04.167
Identify yourselves.

20:04.250 --> 20:06.125
[speaking in foreign language]

20:07.500 --> 20:09.333
- Can you translate?
- No.

20:09.417 --> 20:11.750
I'm sending Interlac alphabet
and language codes

20:11.833 --> 20:14.958
on a clear channel.
This may take a moment.

20:15.042 --> 20:17.625
- Delenn--
- In a moment, Forell.

20:17.708 --> 20:21.125
- 'White Star Minbari.'
- Yes.

20:21.208 --> 20:22.458
Who are you?

20:22.542 --> 20:25.625
- 'Drakh.'
- Drakh?

20:25.708 --> 20:28.083
Is that your name
or the name of your species?

20:28.167 --> 20:29.750
'Yes.'

20:30.917 --> 20:32.583
Delenn, there's a problem.

20:32.667 --> 20:34.167
We are not translating that.

20:34.250 --> 20:36.083
It's coming through in Minbari.

20:36.167 --> 20:38.000
But you said you sent them
our language codes.

20:38.083 --> 20:40.750
No. I sent them Interlac.
It's easier to translate.

20:40.833 --> 20:44.375
They're using our language,
but I didn't send it to them.

20:44.458 --> 20:46.917
But how can that be..

20:47.000 --> 20:50.292
...unless, unless they've had

20:50.375 --> 20:52.625
some prior contact
with our people.

20:52.708 --> 20:54.542
Do not move, Delenn.

20:58.625 --> 21:01.208
Forell, you would threaten me?

21:01.292 --> 21:02.833
Only as necessary.

21:02.917 --> 21:04.917
Minbari do not kill Minbari.

21:05.000 --> 21:08.458
I do not need to kill you
to cause you pain.

21:08.542 --> 21:09.625
Why are you doing this?

21:09.708 --> 21:11.708
To prevent you
from acting against them

21:11.792 --> 21:13.250
till you've heard
what we have to say.

21:13.333 --> 21:15.000
And then what?

21:15.083 --> 21:16.500
That is up to you..

21:16.583 --> 21:18.333
...and them.

21:18.417 --> 21:20.708
Tell the other ships
to follow us.

21:24.250 --> 21:27.292
[dramatic music]

21:41.792 --> 21:43.250
Well?

21:43.333 --> 21:44.667
I'll give you this much.

21:44.750 --> 21:46.917
You can be pretty convincing
when you want to be.

21:47.000 --> 21:48.500
They still have to check back
with their own people

21:48.583 --> 21:51.708
but for now
you got their support.

21:51.792 --> 21:53.292
And mine.

21:53.375 --> 21:54.875
Because I think
we can trust you

21:54.958 --> 21:56.292
even if you are a liar.

21:57.583 --> 21:59.250
I don't know
what you're talking about.

21:59.333 --> 22:01.500
[chuckles]
Come on, Franklin.

22:01.583 --> 22:04.500
Don't play me for stupid.
I was there.

22:04.583 --> 22:05.792
'You didn't know
about the bombings'

22:05.875 --> 22:07.208
'until you got here.'

22:07.292 --> 22:10.542
'ISN isn't airing
that information outside Earth.'

22:10.625 --> 22:13.583
They don't want to encourage
anyone else to do the same.

22:13.667 --> 22:16.042
So if you didn't know
about the bombings

22:16.125 --> 22:18.583
how could you carry a message
from Sheridan about it?

22:20.542 --> 22:22.750
Well, I, uh..

22:22.833 --> 22:24.917
[chuckles]
Couldn't.

22:25.000 --> 22:26.250
But I know the captain
wouldn't like it

22:26.333 --> 22:28.750
any more than you do,
and since you were having

22:28.833 --> 22:30.583
a hard time with the others,
I thought--

22:30.667 --> 22:33.417
You thought you'd give me
a little outside support.

22:33.500 --> 22:34.333
Yeah.

22:34.417 --> 22:37.417
So, like I said, you're a liar

22:37.500 --> 22:39.458
but you're my kind of liar.

22:39.542 --> 22:40.875
Thanks.

22:46.208 --> 22:48.167
You're welcome.

22:48.250 --> 22:50.958
I was there too, you know.
Didn't thank me.

22:51.042 --> 22:52.750
Well, you were the one
that always told me

22:52.833 --> 22:54.750
that being a ranger
is a thankless job.

22:54.833 --> 22:56.458
Yeah, I know, but it wouldn't
hurt once in a while

22:56.542 --> 22:59.292
just for the sheer
change of pace.

22:59.375 --> 23:01.792
Ask me,
I think she likes you.

23:01.875 --> 23:03.250
Nah, come on.
No, it's just business.

23:03.333 --> 23:04.583
- That's all.
- 'Stephen..'

23:04.667 --> 23:06.083
Look, I was just, just
helping her out

23:06.167 --> 23:07.375
of a difficult situation,
that's all.

23:07.458 --> 23:08.750
Fifty credits
says that's not all

23:08.833 --> 23:09.958
she wants you
to help her out of.

23:10.042 --> 23:11.833
Oh, come on,
Marcus, you are such a..

23:11.917 --> 23:14.125
- 'Romantic?'
- Yeah.

23:14.208 --> 23:16.458
We're still in a war here,
Stephen.

23:16.542 --> 23:18.792
Only now,
it's a different kind of war.

23:18.875 --> 23:21.000
Maybe the worst of the two.

23:21.083 --> 23:22.958
It's hard to know
who to trust.

23:23.042 --> 23:25.667
Situation like this
makes you afraid.

23:27.708 --> 23:30.250
Makes you want
to reach out to someone

23:30.333 --> 23:32.125
who may just feel
the same way as you do

23:32.208 --> 23:34.500
about things,
who might be willing

23:34.583 --> 23:37.583
to risk this much
to help you

23:37.667 --> 23:41.000
when the rest of the world
couldn't give a damn.

23:41.083 --> 23:42.917
Oh, Franklin,
I almost forgot

23:43.000 --> 23:45.042
since it was your hotel
that was bombed this morning

23:45.125 --> 23:46.667
you're on your own.

23:46.750 --> 23:49.000
Maybe you'd like to join me
for dinner tonight.

23:49.083 --> 23:51.625
I can't promise much,
but it'll be the best

23:51.708 --> 23:52.958
we can pull together.

23:54.125 --> 23:56.167
Sure.

23:56.250 --> 23:58.000
We're a little short-handed
on guard duty tonight

23:58.083 --> 23:59.417
if you could help out..

23:59.500 --> 24:00.667
Love to.

24:05.667 --> 24:06.833
That'll be 50 credits.

24:06.917 --> 24:08.833
Oh, no, no,
don't you start with me, Marcus.

24:08.917 --> 24:10.708
- Don't.
- Come on, you cheap bastard.

24:10.792 --> 24:13.375
- Marcus, look..
- Oh, sorry.

24:13.458 --> 24:15.750
Got to go. Guard duty.

24:18.250 --> 24:21.333
Touch passion
when it comes your way, Stephen.

24:21.417 --> 24:23.542
It's rare enough as it is.

24:23.625 --> 24:27.208
Don't walk away
when it calls you by name.

24:27.292 --> 24:30.375
[instrumental music]

24:42.875 --> 24:45.542
- How much further?
- This is far enough.

24:45.625 --> 24:47.542
We're here.

24:47.625 --> 24:50.667
[dramatic music]

25:13.708 --> 25:16.875
These Drakh. Who are they?

25:16.958 --> 25:18.917
Friends.

25:19.000 --> 25:21.083
Tell 'em to allow
the life pod on board.

25:21.167 --> 25:22.583
He will not be armed.

25:22.667 --> 25:24.583
You have my word.

25:24.667 --> 25:27.708
[intense music]

25:34.042 --> 25:37.083
[dramatic music]

26:41.458 --> 26:42.917
Who are you?

26:44.375 --> 26:46.417
Are you a Drakh?

26:48.500 --> 26:51.917
Emissary.
Speak for Drakh.

26:52.000 --> 26:54.000
I brought you another.

26:54.083 --> 26:55.958
This one is important.

26:56.042 --> 26:57.625
She can be of great help to us.

26:57.708 --> 27:00.625
- Her name is--
- Unimportant.

27:00.708 --> 27:02.417
Tell.

27:02.500 --> 27:04.875
What I told you
before was true.

27:04.958 --> 27:08.083
The Warrior Caste has formed
a council of its own.

27:08.167 --> 27:09.500
With the Grey Council gone,
there's nothing

27:09.583 --> 27:11.917
to hold them in check
except them.

27:12.000 --> 27:14.583
(Lennier)
'You cannot use them
to attack our own people.'

27:14.667 --> 27:18.750
That is not my intent.
Listen to me, please.

27:18.833 --> 27:20.833
My family was at Sikar
when the Warrior Caste

27:20.917 --> 27:23.667
decided it no longer
wished to share its resources.

27:23.750 --> 27:26.500
They were driven out,
their personal flyers destroyed

27:26.583 --> 27:28.750
and forced to walk
to the next city.

27:28.833 --> 27:32.542
But Sikar is on the edge
of the Southern Polar Region.

27:32.625 --> 27:34.625
Most of them died
from cold and exposure

27:34.708 --> 27:36.542
before reaching Drogani.

27:36.625 --> 27:40.042
My family did not survive.

27:40.125 --> 27:42.208
Minbari do not kill Minbari

27:42.292 --> 27:46.083
but when it is the elements,
the night, the cold..

27:46.167 --> 27:48.042
...well, is that truly murder?

27:48.875 --> 27:50.917
I didn't know, Forell.

27:51.000 --> 27:52.167
I'm sorry.

27:52.250 --> 27:54.125
The word is now only spreading

27:54.208 --> 27:57.000
but the others don't believe
it could happen to us.

27:57.083 --> 28:00.708
But it is just how it happened
in the days before Valen.

28:00.792 --> 28:04.250
Because they didn't believe,
they will not act.

28:04.333 --> 28:06.917
If we allow the Warrior Caste
to take control of Minbari

28:07.000 --> 28:08.708
it will be too late.

28:08.792 --> 28:10.417
We must have allies..

28:10.500 --> 28:13.750
...even if we do not use them,
that they exist at all will make

28:13.833 --> 28:15.625
the Warrior Caste reconsider.

28:15.708 --> 28:18.167
So you have gone to outsiders.

28:18.250 --> 28:20.375
(Forell)
'What other choice is there?'

28:20.458 --> 28:22.792
'You have these ships,
but you are still outnumbered.'

28:22.875 --> 28:24.458
'The Drakh can help.'

28:24.542 --> 28:26.292
They've offered us
protection in exchange

28:26.375 --> 28:28.292
for allowing them to move
into several deserted worlds

28:28.375 --> 28:30.000
along our borders.

28:30.083 --> 28:31.958
We do not give shelter
to thieves

28:32.042 --> 28:33.333
who prey on innocent ships.

28:33.417 --> 28:35.542
They only use force
against military vessels

28:35.625 --> 28:38.000
who threaten them first.

28:38.083 --> 28:40.375
Their presence along the border
will help keep us safe

28:40.458 --> 28:42.542
in case we once again
descend into the chaos

28:42.625 --> 28:44.083
of Civil War.

28:44.167 --> 28:46.875
The Drakh
want peaceful relations.

28:46.958 --> 28:49.292
They want only a place to have
for their own because--

28:49.375 --> 28:53.750
Because they have just
lost their home.

28:53.833 --> 28:56.083
Yes.

28:56.167 --> 28:57.708
'There was an evacuation..'

28:57.792 --> 29:00.458
'...some kind of
natural disaster, they said.'

29:02.625 --> 29:05.125
This homeworld of yours..

29:05.208 --> 29:07.250
...did it have a name?

29:07.333 --> 29:09.208
Yes.

29:09.292 --> 29:10.750
What was it?

29:10.833 --> 29:12.208
Home.

29:12.292 --> 29:13.500
Home.

29:13.583 --> 29:16.125
I'm sorry if I had to force
you to come here

29:16.208 --> 29:18.250
but there was no other way.

29:18.333 --> 29:19.500
And if the others
should hear of this

29:19.583 --> 29:20.750
then you can
tell them truthfully

29:20.833 --> 29:22.875
that you were forced to come.

29:22.958 --> 29:24.292
I could not have harmed you

29:24.375 --> 29:27.292
but it was important
that you see them for yourself.

29:29.042 --> 29:31.500
We can be the salvation
of our society.

29:31.583 --> 29:33.375
'You belong
to the Grey Council.'

29:33.458 --> 29:35.500
'You can take their offer
to the Religious Caste.'

29:35.583 --> 29:37.125
They will respect you.

29:45.917 --> 29:47.375
I will consider your offer.

29:48.708 --> 29:51.167
Tell the others
that we will meet here

29:51.250 --> 29:53.375
again in seven days.

29:53.458 --> 29:56.375
I will give you
my answer then.

29:56.458 --> 29:58.458
They know.

30:01.125 --> 30:04.333
Thank you. You will not
regret this, Delenn.

30:07.667 --> 30:09.542
Delenn.

30:09.625 --> 30:12.667
[intense music]

30:18.292 --> 30:19.833
You didn't tell them
who you were bringing?

30:19.917 --> 30:21.208
No. There wasn't time.

30:21.292 --> 30:23.333
Tell the other ships
to stand by.

30:23.417 --> 30:25.833
Let me know as soon as
the emissary has left.

30:25.917 --> 30:28.125
- Why are you--
- Don't you understand?

30:28.208 --> 30:29.958
Sheridan and I
defeated the Shadows

30:30.042 --> 30:31.958
drove them and their allies
from Z'ha'dum

30:32.042 --> 30:33.167
which was then destroyed.

30:33.250 --> 30:35.417
They worked
for the Shadows, Forell

30:35.500 --> 30:37.750
and now you brought me
right into the middle of them.

30:37.833 --> 30:40.667
No. You must have be mistaken.

30:40.750 --> 30:42.375
- It's possible--
- No.

30:42.458 --> 30:44.375
I felt it
as soon as I saw him.

30:44.458 --> 30:48.292
I have been to Z'ha'dum.
I saw the evacuation.

30:48.375 --> 30:51.083
We defeated their masters,
and now they seek

30:51.167 --> 30:53.292
to become masters themselves
and destroy those

30:53.375 --> 30:54.875
who defeated the Shadows.

30:54.958 --> 30:56.583
Now that they know, who I am

30:56.667 --> 30:59.125
they will attack as soon as
it is safe to do so.

30:59.208 --> 31:00.917
The Drakh shuttle is leaving.

31:01.000 --> 31:04.042
[dramatic music]

31:25.667 --> 31:28.667
Can we open a jump point,
escape before they can attack?

31:28.750 --> 31:30.958
No, they would detect
the energy spike

31:31.042 --> 31:33.208
and destroy us before
we could enter hyperspace.

31:33.292 --> 31:35.375
But we can outrun them.
We're faster than they are.

31:35.458 --> 31:37.625
Once we're moving, yes,
but we have to fight inertia

31:37.708 --> 31:40.125
to gain top speed, and that
will take several seconds.

31:40.208 --> 31:42.708
Several seconds is all
they will need to destroy us.

31:42.792 --> 31:44.125
What are they waiting for?

31:44.208 --> 31:45.875
We've drifted closer
to their mother ship.

31:45.958 --> 31:48.292
If they attack at this range,
they'll damage it.

31:48.375 --> 31:50.792
Let us use that against them.

31:50.875 --> 31:54.167
Lennier, have you ever seen the
Warrior Caste training flights?

31:54.250 --> 31:55.292
Yes.

31:55.375 --> 31:57.042
Have you seen
them skin dancing?

31:57.125 --> 32:00.167
- I have.
- Can you do the same thing?

32:00.250 --> 32:03.958
Not without approximately five
years of additional training.

32:04.042 --> 32:05.417
That would be no then.

32:05.500 --> 32:07.208
But I can program
the parameters into the ship's

32:07.292 --> 32:09.042
artificial intelligence matrix.

32:09.125 --> 32:10.500
And what do you do then?

32:10.583 --> 32:13.833
Touch that button
and pray very, very fast.

32:13.917 --> 32:15.167
Start working.

32:15.250 --> 32:17.500
Move us away
from the other ships slowly.

32:17.583 --> 32:20.125
Let them think
we are leaving as planned.

32:25.792 --> 32:28.833
[dramatic music]

32:37.542 --> 32:39.167
Enemy weapon systems
are powering up.

32:39.250 --> 32:40.708
- Have they locked on yet?
- No.

32:40.792 --> 32:42.708
They won't lock on
until they're ready to fire.

32:42.792 --> 32:45.333
Link all the other ships
into our control system.

32:56.458 --> 32:58.875
- They're locking on!
- Now!

32:58.958 --> 33:02.000
[music continues]

33:17.958 --> 33:19.625
How long until maximum thrust?

33:19.708 --> 33:21.875
Almost there.

33:21.958 --> 33:24.042
[music continues]

33:39.500 --> 33:41.917
Approaching optimum speed.

33:42.000 --> 33:43.667
Activate jump engines.

33:43.750 --> 33:45.250
Break off! Now!

33:45.333 --> 33:47.375
[music continues]

34:07.583 --> 34:08.958
[explosion]

34:11.083 --> 34:12.875
Ugh!

34:12.958 --> 34:14.542
[groans]

34:16.125 --> 34:18.000
[men groaning]

34:18.083 --> 34:20.167
[intense continues]

34:29.125 --> 34:30.542
I'm sorry, Delenn.

34:31.833 --> 34:33.250
I did not know.

34:34.750 --> 34:37.458
I thought
I was helping our people.

34:39.417 --> 34:40.792
I thought..

34:50.917 --> 34:52.208
No.

34:54.250 --> 34:55.875
I am sorry, Forell.

34:57.417 --> 34:59.833
I should never
have been away this long.

35:02.750 --> 35:04.375
What's our status?

35:04.458 --> 35:05.833
Damage is substantial

35:05.917 --> 35:08.042
but auto-repair systems
are functional.

35:08.125 --> 35:10.792
Setting a course for Babylon 5.

35:10.875 --> 35:12.750
Who said we were leaving?

35:12.833 --> 35:14.917
They destroyed ships
from League Worlds

35:15.000 --> 35:19.167
murdered their crews,
destroyed White Star 16.

35:19.250 --> 35:20.958
And now..

35:21.042 --> 35:23.833
...they will pay the price.

35:23.917 --> 35:26.917
[dramatic music]

35:46.917 --> 35:49.958
[music continues]

36:10.708 --> 36:12.875
The Drakh mothership
is heading for the jump gate.

36:12.958 --> 36:14.750
- How fast?
- Fast.

36:14.833 --> 36:16.417
Be faster.

36:16.500 --> 36:19.583
[music continues]

36:34.042 --> 36:35.083
Hold on!

36:35.167 --> 36:38.250
[music continues]

36:46.667 --> 36:48.083
End this.

36:51.542 --> 36:54.583
[explosion]

37:04.958 --> 37:07.958
- The target is--
- Yes, Lennier.

37:08.042 --> 37:09.375
I see.

37:10.833 --> 37:15.708
Delenn, it would seem
that we have a problem at home.

37:15.792 --> 37:17.417
I know.

37:19.167 --> 37:21.708
Call the other ships,
Lennier.

37:21.792 --> 37:23.792
Take us to Babylon 5.

37:26.250 --> 37:29.292
[mellow music]

37:43.208 --> 37:46.250
[instrumental music]

38:02.542 --> 38:04.833
Curious thing about humans.

38:04.917 --> 38:06.792
Minbari cities
remain untouched

38:06.875 --> 38:09.500
and unchanged for centuries.

38:09.583 --> 38:11.583
I leave for three days..

38:11.667 --> 38:13.167
...and you redecorate.

38:13.250 --> 38:15.125
[chuckles]

38:15.208 --> 38:17.958
Me and my bright ideas.

38:18.042 --> 38:20.708
But once this place is on-line,
we'll finally be able

38:20.792 --> 38:23.458
to get our story out
to the fleet, the colonies

38:23.542 --> 38:27.750
even Earth, if we can slip
past the jammers.

38:27.833 --> 38:31.208
'I heard about what happened
to you out there.'

38:32.625 --> 38:34.875
While you were gone,
we heard about more attacks.

38:34.958 --> 38:38.542
Some of the ships were identical
to the ones you ran into.

38:38.625 --> 38:41.042
You still think
it came from Z'ha'dum?

38:41.125 --> 38:42.958
Positive,
there's no way of knowing

38:43.042 --> 38:44.833
how many other
raiders are out there

38:44.917 --> 38:47.500
but these Drakh
worry me the most.

38:47.583 --> 38:49.958
[sighs]
Wild cards.

38:51.250 --> 38:52.875
Just what we need.

38:54.208 --> 38:56.875
It never seems to end,
does it?

38:56.958 --> 38:59.083
You know,
my grandfather once told me

38:59.167 --> 39:02.333
the duration's gonna be
a lot longer than the war

39:02.417 --> 39:05.708
[chuckles]
Never quite understood that
until now.

39:05.792 --> 39:08.167
And it isn't just
the other races.

39:09.833 --> 39:14.208
John, there are problems
waiting for me on Minbari.

39:14.292 --> 39:16.083
The caste system
is falling apart.

39:16.167 --> 39:18.083
If we don't pull it back
together again

39:18.167 --> 39:20.292
there will be Civil War.

39:20.375 --> 39:24.667
So I'm going home for a while
until this is fixed.

39:24.750 --> 39:26.917
It may take some time..

39:27.000 --> 39:29.833
...but I think in some ways

39:29.917 --> 39:32.792
the time apart
will be good for us.

39:32.875 --> 39:34.958
Good for you.

39:35.042 --> 39:36.083
How so?

39:37.667 --> 39:39.458
Before the war..

39:39.542 --> 39:42.125
...Dukhat wanted to know
more about your people

39:42.208 --> 39:45.125
so I began
studying your history.

39:45.208 --> 39:47.500
I came to the conclusion
that of all the races

39:47.583 --> 39:51.708
we had encountered,
humans were the most dangerous

39:51.792 --> 39:53.708
'because humans
form communities'

39:53.792 --> 39:56.333
'and from that diversity
comes a strength'

39:56.417 --> 39:59.333
'no single race can withstand.'

39:59.417 --> 40:01.708
That is your strength..

40:01.792 --> 40:04.542
...and it is that
which makes you dangerous.

40:06.875 --> 40:09.458
Ever since you came back
from Z'ha'dum

40:09.542 --> 40:11.833
you've been trying to act
as if nothing had changed

40:11.917 --> 40:16.042
trying to put it all back
the way it was.

40:16.125 --> 40:18.792
I've tried to talk to you
about what Lorien said

40:18.875 --> 40:21.833
that you have
only 20 years left

40:21.917 --> 40:23.875
but you don't want to talk
about that.

40:25.250 --> 40:27.542
You've turned your attention
back toward Earth

40:27.625 --> 40:30.000
distracted yourself with this.

40:30.083 --> 40:33.208
That is why you're so angry
with Mr. Garibaldi

40:33.292 --> 40:36.292
but as long as he's outside..

40:36.375 --> 40:39.083
...things can never be
the way they were.

40:42.542 --> 40:45.167
While you were at Z'ha'dum..

40:45.250 --> 40:47.375
...you were touched by destiny.

40:49.083 --> 40:51.750
You cannot just simply
walk away from that.

40:54.167 --> 40:56.667
I know. I know.

40:56.750 --> 40:59.500
It's just that I'm..

40:59.583 --> 41:02.083
I'm tired, Delenn.

41:02.167 --> 41:04.375
Sometimes I feel as if
I've been carrying this station

41:04.458 --> 41:08.208
on my back and crawling through
broken glass for three years.

41:08.292 --> 41:10.708
- We each have our obligations.
- Yeah.

41:10.792 --> 41:13.583
Mine, for now,
is to return home.

41:13.667 --> 41:15.458
I must rebuild the Grey Council

41:15.542 --> 41:18.000
and you must finish the work
that is ahead of you.

41:18.875 --> 41:20.958
Fighting a war is easy.

41:21.042 --> 41:23.000
Destroying is easy.

41:23.083 --> 41:26.167
Building a new world
out of what's left of the old

41:26.250 --> 41:30.083
that is what's hard,
but that is your strength.

41:30.167 --> 41:32.708
So much has
fallen apart out there.

41:32.792 --> 41:36.417
You must help
to put it back together.

41:36.500 --> 41:39.375
And how will your leaving
make this any easier for me?

41:41.458 --> 41:44.417
You've been holding back..

41:44.500 --> 41:46.250
...trying to protect
all of us from the parts

41:46.333 --> 41:48.875
of you that changed at Z'ha'dum.

41:48.958 --> 41:52.167
You've tried to act
as if nothing had changed.

41:54.458 --> 41:56.500
But I know your heart, John.

41:57.833 --> 42:02.083
You can fool the others,
but you cannot fool me.

42:02.167 --> 42:03.667
What is left..

42:03.750 --> 42:06.792
...requires
that you'd be dangerous

42:06.875 --> 42:08.417
and I think you would
be more comfortable

42:08.500 --> 42:11.333
doing that
if I were not here.

42:18.000 --> 42:21.250
Would it make a difference
if I asked you not to go?

42:21.333 --> 42:23.875
Would you want it
to make a difference?

42:26.000 --> 42:28.625
No. I suppose not.

42:31.083 --> 42:33.208
[sighs]

42:33.292 --> 42:36.125
Well, how long
before you have to leave?

42:36.208 --> 42:37.750
Tomorrow morning.

42:39.875 --> 42:41.083
Dinner?

42:42.792 --> 42:44.375
Love to.

42:50.417 --> 42:52.458
Have you heard
from Marcus and Stephen?

42:52.542 --> 42:55.958
Not since before you left,
which is what I figured.

42:56.042 --> 42:59.167
I'm sure Stephen
has his hands full.

42:59.250 --> 43:01.292
[both chuckle]

43:15.417 --> 43:17.292
(Number One)
'Oh, Stephen!'

43:23.083 --> 43:26.083
[swooshing]

43:33.583 --> 43:35.958
[theme music]
