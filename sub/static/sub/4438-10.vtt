WEBVTT

00:04.963 --> 00:06.260
Preston, I must say,

00:06.465 --> 00:07.682
the guest list for
this year's party

00:07.841 --> 00:09.514
has so much diversity.

00:09.718 --> 00:12.813
Yes, a nice mix of
millionaires and billionaires.

00:13.013 --> 00:14.890
Put the oyster fork
at an angle.

00:15.098 --> 00:16.600
We're not animals, man.

00:16.808 --> 00:18.310
Now where the devil is...

00:18.519 --> 00:20.317
Pacifica!

00:20.479 --> 00:22.231
What did I tell you
about that dress?

00:22.439 --> 00:25.033
The theme is sea foam green,
not lake foam green.

00:25.234 --> 00:27.282
- Go change.
- But I kind of like it.

00:27.486 --> 00:28.703
Mind your mother,
Pacifica.

00:28.904 --> 00:30.372
- But--
- [bell clangs]

00:30.572 --> 00:32.290
Yes, Father.

00:32.491 --> 00:34.038
[loud rumbling]

00:34.201 --> 00:35.578
[gasping]

00:37.454 --> 00:40.503
Oh, no, it's...
happening.

00:44.044 --> 00:46.217
Yes, you are
my possessions.

00:46.421 --> 00:49.220
ObeY me!
[Yells]

00:49.424 --> 00:50.676
This is a disaster.

00:50.842 --> 00:52.685
The party's in
just 24 hours.

00:52.844 --> 00:56.314
Surely there's someone who could
handle this sort of nonsense.

00:56.515 --> 00:59.394
And I think I know
just the person.

01:19.329 --> 01:21.172
<i>[man] You asked for it,
you got it.</i>

01:21.373 --> 01:24.297
<i>An entire 48-hour
marathon of</i> Ghost Harassers.

01:24.501 --> 01:26.299
<i>On the Used To Be About
History Channel.</i>

01:26.503 --> 01:28.380
Be strong, bladder.

01:28.589 --> 01:30.387
We're not gonna move
till sunset.

01:30.591 --> 01:34.346
<i>We interrupt this program
to bring you breaking news.</i>

01:34.553 --> 01:35.770
- Oh, what?
- It's starting!

01:35.971 --> 01:38.850
- Turn it up.
- Make room for Grenda.

01:39.057 --> 01:42.152
<i>Tonight's the night, but I've
been out here for days.</i>

01:42.352 --> 01:43.979
<i>The Northwest
family's annual</i>

01:44.187 --> 01:47.111
<i>high-society
shindig ball soiree is here.</i>

01:47.316 --> 01:49.114
<i>And even though common folk
aren't let in,</i>

01:49.318 --> 01:50.865
<i>that won't stop us from
camping out</i>

01:51.069 --> 01:52.366
<i>for a peek at
the fanciness.</i>

01:52.571 --> 01:55.165
[all] Ooh!

01:55.365 --> 01:57.333
Okay, can someone
please explain

01:57.534 --> 01:59.002
why people care about this?

01:59.161 --> 02:01.004
Um, it's pretty much
the best party of all time.

02:01.163 --> 02:03.461
Rich food, richer boys.

02:03.665 --> 02:06.794
They say each gift basket
has a live quail inside.

02:06.960 --> 02:09.179
Give me your life, Pacifica.

02:09.378 --> 02:11.632
Guys, in case you've
already forgotten,

02:11.798 --> 02:13.675
Pacifica Northwest
is the worst.

02:13.842 --> 02:15.264
[knocking on door]

02:15.469 --> 02:17.437
And that's not just
jealousy talking.

02:17.638 --> 02:19.231
I'd say that
to her face.

02:19.431 --> 02:20.398
I need your help.

02:20.599 --> 02:22.397
You're the worst.

02:22.559 --> 02:23.401
[all gasping]

02:23.560 --> 02:26.279
_ See?
' [knocking]

02:26.480 --> 02:28.653
Look, you think it's easy
for me to come here?

02:28.857 --> 02:30.359
I don't wanna be seen
in this hovel.

02:30.567 --> 02:32.820
But there's something
haunting Northwest Manor.

02:33.028 --> 02:36.077
If you don't help me,
the party could be ruined.

02:36.239 --> 02:37.832
And why should
I trust you?

02:38.033 --> 02:40.081
All you've ever done
is try to humiliate me and Mabel.

02:40.243 --> 02:41.620
Just name
your price, okay?

02:41.828 --> 02:43.250
I'll give you
anything.

02:43.455 --> 02:46.425
Hi, Pacifica.
Excuse us.

02:46.625 --> 02:49.003
Dipper, don't you see
what this means?

02:49.211 --> 02:51.009
If you help Pacifica,
you could get us invites

02:51.213 --> 02:53.591
to the greatest party
of all time.

02:53.799 --> 02:56.348
What? Mabel, this is
Pacifica we're talking about.

02:56.551 --> 02:58.724
But it's Candy
and Grenda's dream.

02:58.929 --> 03:01.603
[both] Dream!

03:01.807 --> 03:04.526
[sighs] Fine.
I'll bust your ghost.

03:04.726 --> 03:07.696
But, in exchange, I'll need three
tickets to the party.

03:07.896 --> 03:11.821
[growls] You're just lucky
I'm desperate.

03:12.025 --> 03:15.495
[all] Whoo! Desperate,
desperate, desperate!

03:15.696 --> 03:18.324
Grenda, get the glue gun.
We're making dresses.

03:29.835 --> 03:31.929
Welcome to Northwest
Manor, dorks.

03:32.129 --> 03:34.131
Try not to touch
anything.

03:34.339 --> 03:36.558
[all exclaiming]

03:36.758 --> 03:38.510
Everything's so fancy.

03:38.719 --> 03:40.562
Fancy floors,
fancy plants.

03:40.721 --> 03:43.349
[gasps]
Fancy man.

03:43.557 --> 03:44.934
Yes. Very good, miss.

03:45.142 --> 03:46.860
The rumors were true.

03:50.313 --> 03:52.736
Ah, if it isn't
the man of the hour.

03:52.941 --> 03:55.410
Hopefully, you can help us
with our little... situation

03:55.610 --> 03:59.035
- before the guests arrive in an hour.
- I'll do my best.

03:59.239 --> 04:03.335
Splendid. Pacifica, take our
guests to the problem room,

04:03.535 --> 04:05.287
and, uh... he's not
wearing that, is he?

04:05.495 --> 04:07.168
[teeth squeaking]

04:07.372 --> 04:08.339
I'm on it.

04:10.500 --> 04:12.502
It's like this collar
is strangling me.

04:12.711 --> 04:14.713
Who do you guys think you're
impressing with this stuff?

04:14.880 --> 04:16.974
Um, everyone.

04:17.173 --> 04:18.892
<i>You</i> wouldn't understand.

04:19.091 --> 04:21.220
High standards are what make
the Northwest family great.

04:21.428 --> 04:23.726
Funny, I thought it was
lying about founding the town.

04:23.930 --> 04:25.648
Don't touch that.

04:27.559 --> 04:30.108
Oh, wow, guys,
it's the guest list.

04:30.312 --> 04:31.404
Whoa!

04:31.563 --> 04:33.156
Check out this hottie.

04:33.356 --> 04:35.324
Marius von Fundshauser.

04:35.484 --> 04:37.282
He's a baron
from Austria.

04:37.486 --> 04:40.035
Forget the quail. I'm putting him
in my guest basket.

04:40.238 --> 04:42.991
Hold up, ladies. I can't believe
I'm gonna say this,

04:43.200 --> 04:44.747
but I think this boy
is out of our league.

04:44.951 --> 04:46.828
Grenda's right.
He's a white whale.

04:47.037 --> 04:48.789
Hunting him
will destroy us.

04:48.997 --> 04:51.375
There are tons of
cute boys coming.

04:51.583 --> 04:55.338
Let's swear a sisters' truce not
to waste time on Marius.

04:56.505 --> 04:57.427
Deal.

04:57.631 --> 04:58.427
- Deal.
- Deal.

04:58.632 --> 05:02.387
[all laughing]

05:03.929 --> 05:05.602
Whoa.

05:09.226 --> 05:11.775
[Pacifica] This is the main room
where it's been happening.

05:11.978 --> 05:13.275
Yep, this looks like
the kind of room

05:13.480 --> 05:14.572
that would be
haunted, all right.

05:14.773 --> 05:16.275
I wouldn't be worried, though.

05:16.441 --> 05:18.114
Ghosts fall under
a ten-category scale.

05:18.318 --> 05:20.912
Falling plates sound like
a category one.

05:21.112 --> 05:23.410
So what? Are you going
to bore him back into the afterlife

05:23.615 --> 05:25.492
by reading from
this book?

05:25.700 --> 05:27.668
Just gotta splash this sucker with
some anointed water,

05:27.869 --> 05:29.997
and he should be out of
your probably-fake blonde hair.

05:30.163 --> 05:31.665
What was that
about my hair?

05:31.873 --> 05:33.375
Sh. I'm picking
something up.

05:43.385 --> 05:46.184
Come on, stupid thing.
There we go.

05:48.723 --> 05:50.600
- Uh, Pacifica?
- [screams]

05:58.149 --> 06:01.995
Ancient sins.
Ancient sins.

06:02.195 --> 06:06.166
Ancient sins.
Ancient sins.

06:06.366 --> 06:08.334
[chanting continues]

06:08.535 --> 06:10.082
Dipper, what is this?

06:10.245 --> 06:12.464
It's a category ten.

06:12.664 --> 06:14.291
[both screaming]

06:17.085 --> 06:19.463
Ancient blood
and blackened skies.

06:19.671 --> 06:22.925
The forest dark
once more shall rise.

06:23.133 --> 06:24.976
What do we do,
what do we do?

06:25.176 --> 06:27.178
Don't worry.
It can't get worse than this.

06:40.150 --> 06:44.781
I smell a Northwest.

06:47.032 --> 06:49.285
Come out.

06:49.492 --> 06:52.336
Come out,
wherever you are.

06:52.537 --> 06:55.006
Hurry. Read through
your dumb book already.

06:55.165 --> 06:56.963
I'm looking,
and it's not dumb, okay?

06:57.167 --> 06:59.044
This book is gonna
save our lives.

06:59.252 --> 07:00.674
All right, here we go.
Advice.

07:02.297 --> 07:04.095
Oh, seriously?

07:05.508 --> 07:08.432
You shouldn't
have come here.

07:08.637 --> 07:10.264
This way. Hurry!

07:13.099 --> 07:15.477
Welcome, dukes
and duchesses.

07:15.644 --> 07:17.396
Sultans
and sportsmen.

07:17.562 --> 07:19.064
Yo, what up, Presto?

07:19.272 --> 07:22.651
And reclusive 102-year-old mayor
of Gravity Falls,

07:22.859 --> 07:24.281
Mayor Befufftlefumpter.

07:24.444 --> 07:26.037
[birds cawing]

07:26.237 --> 07:27.830
It's okay.
They're with me.

07:28.031 --> 07:30.409
Tonight, we will enjoy
only the finest of tastes

07:30.617 --> 07:32.836
and only the snootiest
of laughter.

07:33.036 --> 07:35.209
[fawning laughter]

07:35.413 --> 07:36.414
That's the ticket.

07:36.623 --> 07:38.125
Cheese, chocolate.

07:38.333 --> 07:40.210
Cheese, chocolate.

07:40.418 --> 07:42.170
Candy, listen
to me carefully.

07:42.379 --> 07:44.256
You're caught in
a sweet-savory loop.

07:44.464 --> 07:45.932
Put the fondue fork down.

07:46.132 --> 07:49.978
- I want to, but I can't.
- [tapping sound]

07:50.178 --> 07:53.227
Introducing
Baron Marius von Fundshauser.

07:53.431 --> 07:54.933
[fanfare plays]

07:58.436 --> 08:00.234
<i>Guten tag.</i>

08:00.438 --> 08:02.315
<i>Guten</i> take me now!

08:02.482 --> 08:05.235
Mabel, we had a truce.

08:05.402 --> 08:07.245
Yes, yes,
yes, a truce.

08:07.445 --> 08:10.073
Grenda, can you go
fetch us some fancy napkins?

08:10.240 --> 08:12.083
Wow. Okay.

08:12.242 --> 08:14.620
Listen, Mabel, I don't know if
I can follow this truce.

08:14.828 --> 08:17.297
- He is too adorable.
- Me, too, Candy.

08:17.497 --> 08:20.000
But what do we do?
He's unattainable.

08:20.208 --> 08:22.461
What if we flirt
with him as a team?

08:22.669 --> 08:25.468
With our cuteness combined,
one of us might have a chance.

08:25.672 --> 08:27.299
It is the perfect plan.

08:27.507 --> 08:29.259
But what about Grenda?

08:29.467 --> 08:32.311
I love Grenda, Mabel,
but these boys are fancy.

08:32.511 --> 08:34.606
Her aggressive flirting
style might scare them away.

08:34.806 --> 08:37.480
Hey, what's on your shirt?

08:37.642 --> 08:39.770
Ha! Gullible!
Loser!

08:46.276 --> 08:47.903
Hurry. Through
the garden.

08:48.111 --> 08:49.363
Watch out for peacocks.

08:52.490 --> 08:54.242
Come on, come on.
I got it.

08:54.451 --> 08:57.295
A haunted painting can only
be trapped in a silver mirror.

08:57.495 --> 08:59.338
Look, there's
a silver mirror right there.

09:00.498 --> 09:03.001
Wait. Don't
go in there.

09:03.209 --> 09:05.177
This room has my parents'
favorite carpet pattern.

09:05.378 --> 09:06.925
They'll lose it if we
track mud in there.

09:07.130 --> 09:08.882
What? Are you serious?

09:09.090 --> 09:11.889
- We'll find another way.
- [ghost wailing]

09:12.093 --> 09:14.346
Pacifica, we don't have time for this.
Let me through!

09:14.554 --> 09:16.556
No. My parents
will kill me.

09:16.723 --> 09:18.691
Why are you so afraid
of your parents?

09:18.892 --> 09:20.439
You wouldn't
understand.

09:27.650 --> 09:29.698
What is this place?

09:29.903 --> 09:32.372
That's weird. I don't
even know where this room is.

09:32.572 --> 09:34.290
Hopefully, the ghost
doesn't either.

09:34.491 --> 09:36.334
Yeah. Maybe we're safe.

09:40.538 --> 09:42.757
- Pacifica! Watch out!
- [shrieks]

09:42.957 --> 09:45.301
Your fate is sealed!

09:47.587 --> 09:49.009
A silver mirror.

09:49.214 --> 09:51.182
[ghost growling]

09:51.382 --> 09:54.886
Prepare to die,
Northwest!

10:01.768 --> 10:03.270
Did you get him?

10:04.938 --> 10:07.908
Oh, free me!

10:08.108 --> 10:10.202
[both]
Yes!

10:10.360 --> 10:12.078
We did it!

10:13.947 --> 10:16.041
[clears throat]

10:16.199 --> 10:19.169
Can I pay you to pretend
that never happened?

10:19.369 --> 10:23.374
Well, Pacifica, you really
found the right man for the job.

10:23.581 --> 10:25.299
We can't
thank you enough.

10:25.500 --> 10:27.298
That's enough.

10:27.502 --> 10:29.755
Hey, just holdin' up
my end of the deal.

10:29.921 --> 10:31.218
Wait. Leaving already?

10:31.422 --> 10:33.720
You're at the world's
best party, dummy.

10:33.883 --> 10:35.226
I'd love to stay,

10:35.426 --> 10:39.431
but I've got a category ten
ghost to dispose of.

10:39.639 --> 10:41.892
Ha ha.
Category ten.

10:42.100 --> 10:43.727
[both laughing]

10:43.935 --> 10:45.357
Call me crazy,

10:45.520 --> 10:48.239
but maybe she's not
that bad after all.

10:48.439 --> 10:51.613
[ghost laughing]

10:51.818 --> 10:53.616
What are you laughing about, man?
I defeated you.

10:53.820 --> 10:55.322
You've been had, boy.

10:55.530 --> 11:00.331
- You remind me of me 150 years ago.
- What do you mean?

11:00.535 --> 11:03.163
<i>One hundred and fifty
years ago this day,</i>

11:03.371 --> 11:05.465
<i>the Northwests asked
us lumber folk</i>

11:05.665 --> 11:07.667
<i>to build them a mansion
atop the hill.</i>

11:07.876 --> 11:10.254
<i>We were told it would be
a service to the town,</i>

11:10.461 --> 11:12.304
<i>that once a year,
they would throw</i>

11:12.505 --> 11:16.260
a <i>grand party, and all
would share in the bounty.</i>

11:16.467 --> 11:21.189
<i>It took years of back-breaking
labor and sacrifice,</i>

11:21.389 --> 11:23.517
<i>but when it was time
for the grand party</i>

11:23.683 --> 11:26.232
<i>they promised the common
folk of the town,</i>

11:26.436 --> 11:29.030
<i>they refused
to let us in.</i>

11:36.988 --> 11:41.038
You promised, Northwest.

11:41.201 --> 11:44.080
<i>With the trees gone,
the mudslides began.</i>

11:44.287 --> 11:46.164
<i>While they partied
and laughed,</i>

11:46.372 --> 11:48.966
<i>I was swept away
by the storm.</i>

11:51.628 --> 11:54.256
<i>And so I said
with final breath,</i>

11:54.464 --> 11:57.468
<i>150 years I'll return
from death.</i>

11:57.675 --> 11:59.473
<i>And if the gate
still closed to town,</i>

11:59.677 --> 12:02.931
<i>wealthy blood
will stain the ground.</i>

12:03.139 --> 12:06.564
<i>A curse passed down
until this day.</i>

12:08.144 --> 12:09.521
So wait a minute.

12:09.729 --> 12:12.357
The Northwests knew
this haunting was coming,

12:12.523 --> 12:14.321
and they tricked me
into helping them

12:14.484 --> 12:16.862
to avoid ghostly justice?
I'll be right back.

12:17.070 --> 12:19.198
Thank you so much
for coming, mayor.

12:19.364 --> 12:20.786
As a sign of our respect,
please take this chimp servant.

12:20.990 --> 12:23.459
Keep him away from
bright lights.

12:23.660 --> 12:25.378
He gets grabby.

12:25.578 --> 12:27.376
[Dipper] Northwests!

12:27.580 --> 12:29.708
You've got
some explaining to do.

12:31.501 --> 12:33.094
Dipper, you came back.

12:33.294 --> 12:35.968
You lied to me.
All of you did.

12:36.172 --> 12:38.174
All you had to do was let the
townsfolk into the party,

12:38.383 --> 12:40.101
and you could've
broken the curse.

12:40.301 --> 12:42.395
But you made me do
your dirty work instead.

12:44.472 --> 12:47.066
Look at who you're
talking to, boy.

12:47.267 --> 12:50.146
I'm hosting a party for the most
powerful people in the world.

12:50.353 --> 12:52.447
You think they'd come here
if they had to rub elbows

12:52.647 --> 12:55.275
- with your kind?
- My kind?

12:55.441 --> 12:57.489
I was right about you
all along.

12:57.694 --> 12:59.162
You're just as bad
as your parents.

12:59.320 --> 13:01.414
Another link in
the world's worst chain.

13:01.614 --> 13:03.867
I'm sorry.
They made me.

13:04.075 --> 13:06.498
- I should've told you, but...
- [bell clangs]

13:08.371 --> 13:11.671
Enjoy the party. It's the last time
you and your kind

13:11.874 --> 13:14.377
- will ever come.
- [chittering]

13:14.585 --> 13:15.882
No, no!
Those aren't for him.

13:18.506 --> 13:19.803
Stupid Northwests.

13:20.008 --> 13:21.931
Making me do
their exorcism for them.

13:22.135 --> 13:24.183
Exodus demonus,
spookus scarus,

13:24.387 --> 13:26.435
aintafraid us
noghostus.

13:26.639 --> 13:30.564
Dipper, please let me get my vengeance
on the Northwests.

13:30.768 --> 13:32.441
You hate them
as much as I.

13:32.603 --> 13:34.071
Hey, I feel you.

13:34.272 --> 13:35.569
It's just,
my sister's in there,

13:35.773 --> 13:38.447
and you seem
a little unstable, man.

13:38.651 --> 13:40.528
Very well, boy.

13:40.737 --> 13:44.082
Then before you
banish my soul,

13:44.240 --> 13:46.459
may these tired old
lumber eyes

13:46.659 --> 13:50.254
gaze upon the trees
one final time?

13:50.455 --> 13:52.799
Uh... I guess.

13:52.999 --> 13:54.967
Go nuts, man.

13:55.168 --> 13:56.761
[evil laughter]

13:57.962 --> 13:59.589
What?
[screams]

14:07.472 --> 14:11.522
Yes! Vengeance!

14:11.684 --> 14:13.778
Oh, no. Mabel!

14:18.274 --> 14:19.617
Hi. I'm Mabel.

14:19.817 --> 14:21.945
So, Australia, huh?

14:22.153 --> 14:24.247
Do you guys eat
kangaroo meat over there,

14:24.447 --> 14:26.825
or are they
strictly pets?

14:27.033 --> 14:28.285
I am from Austria.

14:28.493 --> 14:30.291
[nervous laughter]
Tag, tag.

14:30.495 --> 14:31.963
I am Candy.

14:32.121 --> 14:34.044
I love the tiny hats
you wear on your shoulders.

14:34.248 --> 14:36.501
If you were a boat,
do you know what kind you'd be?

14:36.709 --> 14:38.211
A dreamboat.
That's what kind.

14:38.419 --> 14:40.342
- You're tagged out.
- Tagged back in.

14:40.546 --> 14:42.048
- You can't do that.
- I can tag myself. It's allowed.

14:42.256 --> 14:43.929
[arguing]

14:44.133 --> 14:45.851
[Grenda] Ahem!

14:46.052 --> 14:47.929
What exactly
was all that?

14:48.137 --> 14:50.310
You were flirting with
Marius without me.

14:50.515 --> 14:52.609
We're sorry, Grenda.
It's just...

14:52.809 --> 14:56.313
Your flirting style can come off
as a bit... intense.

14:56.479 --> 14:58.277
Oh, I see.

14:58.439 --> 15:00.282
You think I shouldn't
be myself

15:00.441 --> 15:02.318
just because I'm in
this stupid mansion.

15:02.485 --> 15:03.486
I thought you liked
my style.

15:03.694 --> 15:06.197
We do, but these boys
might not.

15:06.364 --> 15:09.038
Then I guess they wouldn't
like this either.

15:09.200 --> 15:11.373
- Hey, Marius.
- Yeah?

15:11.577 --> 15:15.457
You've got something
on your shirt.

15:19.127 --> 15:20.094
[both gasping]

15:20.294 --> 15:22.342
[all huffing]

15:26.843 --> 15:28.311
Thank you all for coming.

15:28.511 --> 15:29.728
I think we can all say

15:29.929 --> 15:31.897
this party was
a rousing success.

15:32.098 --> 15:34.192
I guess you could say
it was a slam dunk, Preston.

15:34.392 --> 15:35.894
Yes, yes,
I guess, sure.

15:36.102 --> 15:38.571
A toast...
to our family name.

15:38.771 --> 15:40.444
What?!

15:44.527 --> 15:46.575
Generations locked away.

15:46.779 --> 15:49.783
My revenge
shall have its day.

15:49.991 --> 15:51.538
Oh, the Grim Reaper.

15:51.742 --> 15:54.086
I've been wondering
when you would arrive.

16:02.420 --> 16:04.388
[ferocious growling]

16:11.429 --> 16:12.646
Preston, what are
we going to do?

16:12.847 --> 16:15.191
Prepare the panic room.

16:15.391 --> 16:16.517
[screaming]

16:23.024 --> 16:26.278
Please...
help me.

16:26.444 --> 16:28.867
Whoa! That is messed up.

16:29.071 --> 16:31.369
Just one way
to change your fates.

16:31.574 --> 16:35.374
A Northwest must open
the party gates.

16:35.578 --> 16:37.296
A Northwest?
Pacifica.

16:41.459 --> 16:43.177
Pacifica.
There you are.

16:43.377 --> 16:45.425
The ghost is turning
everyone to wood,

16:45.630 --> 16:48.179
and he just started
rhyming for some reason.

16:48.382 --> 16:49.383
I need your help.

16:49.592 --> 16:51.060
Pacifica?

16:51.260 --> 16:53.058
Wanna know why
this room was locked up?

16:53.262 --> 16:55.185
This is what I found
in here.

16:55.389 --> 16:57.312
A painted record
of every horrible thing

16:57.517 --> 16:59.190
that my family's
ever done.

16:59.393 --> 17:01.191
Lying, cheating,
and then, there's me.

17:01.395 --> 17:05.069
I lied to you just because
I'm too scared to talk back

17:05.273 --> 17:07.742
to my stupid parents.

17:07.944 --> 17:09.366
You were right about me.

17:09.569 --> 17:12.323
I am just another link
in the world's worst chain.

17:12.531 --> 17:16.127
Pacifica, I'm sorry
about what I said earlier,

17:16.327 --> 17:18.079
but just because you're
your parents' daughter

17:18.287 --> 17:19.459
doesn't mean you have
to be like them.

17:19.664 --> 17:22.133
It's not too late.

17:22.333 --> 17:25.678
- [ghost] It's too late!
- Oh, no!

17:25.877 --> 17:28.222
- You are all wood!
- [screaming]

17:36.556 --> 17:38.024
Dipper, wait.

17:39.892 --> 17:41.360
All right, ghost.

17:41.519 --> 17:43.362
Prepare to get...

17:43.521 --> 17:44.898
No, wait!

17:45.106 --> 17:47.108
No, no, no, no!

17:47.316 --> 17:50.035
No, someone help.
Someone help!

17:54.282 --> 17:57.126
A forest of death,
a lesson learned.

17:57.285 --> 18:01.085
And now, the Northwest manor
will burn!

18:03.332 --> 18:04.925
Hey, ugh!-

18:05.126 --> 18:06.844
Over here.

18:07.003 --> 18:08.380
You want me to let in
the townsfolk?

18:08.588 --> 18:10.056
'Cause I'll do it.

18:10.256 --> 18:11.348
Just change everyone back.

18:11.549 --> 18:14.018
You wish to prove yourself?

18:14.218 --> 18:17.563
Pull that lever and open
the grand gate to the town.

18:17.722 --> 18:20.566
Fulfill your ancestors'
promise.

18:20.725 --> 18:22.853
Pacifica Elise Northwest,

18:23.060 --> 18:24.937
stop this instant.

18:25.146 --> 18:27.365
We can't let the town
see us like this.

18:27.523 --> 18:29.196
We have a reputation
to uphold.

18:29.400 --> 18:31.152
Now come into
the panic room.

18:31.319 --> 18:32.571
There's enough mini sandwiches
and oxygen

18:32.778 --> 18:34.371
to last you, me,
and a butler for a week.

18:34.572 --> 18:36.870
[whispers]
We'll eat the butler.

18:40.411 --> 18:44.041
- You dare disobey us?
- [bell clangs]

18:50.421 --> 18:52.469
Dingly, dingly.
Is this bell broken?

18:52.673 --> 18:54.346
Our family name
is broken,

18:54.550 --> 18:56.473
- and I'm gonna fix it.
-[gasps]

18:59.347 --> 19:01.725
Get it, get it.

19:01.932 --> 19:05.357
[crowd clamoring]

19:05.519 --> 19:07.738
Yes, yes,
it's happening-

19:07.938 --> 19:10.361
My heart,
once as hard as oak,

19:10.524 --> 19:13.528
now grows soft like more
of a birch or something.

19:19.784 --> 19:21.286
[gasps]

19:21.494 --> 19:25.294
Pacifica, you are not like
the other Northwests.

19:25.498 --> 19:30.800
I feel lumber justice.

19:38.803 --> 19:41.022
Oh, yes! Yeah!

19:42.223 --> 19:43.600
Good Lord,
the riff-raff.

19:43.808 --> 19:45.276
They're everywhere.

19:45.476 --> 19:47.478
Ooh. Ha ha!

19:47.645 --> 19:50.319
That's not how the fork
should be placed.

19:50.481 --> 19:52.074
Ugh, man,
what happened?

19:52.274 --> 19:53.742
Ahem!

19:55.111 --> 19:57.739
Grenda, we are
so sorry.

19:57.947 --> 19:59.164
We shouldn't have
left you behind.

19:59.323 --> 20:00.415
It's okay.

20:00.616 --> 20:02.835
Maybe I do need
to work on my flirting.

20:03.035 --> 20:05.413
Come on, let's go dunk
our heads into cheese and chocolate.

20:05.621 --> 20:07.623
- Friends.
- Friends.

20:07.832 --> 20:10.927
Wait! Don't go.

20:11.085 --> 20:13.304
Grenda, was it?
I must speak with you.

20:13.504 --> 20:14.847
There's something
about you.

20:15.047 --> 20:16.469
I can't get you
out of my head.

20:16.674 --> 20:18.347
You're so bold
and confident.

20:18.551 --> 20:19.803
I know you're probably
out of my league,

20:20.010 --> 20:21.887
but might I give you
mein phone number?

20:22.096 --> 20:24.144
I don't have a phone.

20:24.348 --> 20:25.691
Write it on my face.

20:25.891 --> 20:28.019
Whoa! Go, Grenda.

20:28.227 --> 20:30.355
I guess we shouldn't
have sold her short.

20:30.521 --> 20:31.738
I call bridesmaid.

20:31.939 --> 20:33.361
What? I call
co-bridesmaids.

20:33.524 --> 20:35.401
Man, if your family
hates you for this,

20:35.609 --> 20:37.327
they're idiots.
This is great.

20:37.528 --> 20:39.326
Enjoy it while it lasts.

20:39.530 --> 20:41.874
Next year, I'm sure they're just gonna
lock everyone out again.

20:42.074 --> 20:44.122
Hey, guess what
we're standing on.

20:44.285 --> 20:45.753
[gasps]

20:53.961 --> 20:56.931
But seriously, I'd better go
find someone to clean this up.

20:57.131 --> 21:00.931
<i>Whoa! Scoobiddy doo!
Hornswaggfle my goat knees!</i>

21:01.135 --> 21:03.684
Well, ho-ho,
what's up, McGucket?

21:05.931 --> 21:07.933
Dipper, I been
lookin' for you.

21:08.142 --> 21:09.189
I fixed the laptop.

21:09.393 --> 21:10.690
I've been doin' calculations,

21:10.895 --> 21:12.317
and I think
something terrible is comin'.

21:12.480 --> 21:14.198
The apocalypse.
The end times.

21:14.398 --> 21:16.150
[sighs]
You know what, McGucket.

21:16.358 --> 21:18.702
How about we talk about
this stuff tomorrow?

21:18.903 --> 21:21.281
It's a party.
Let's have some fun for once, huh?

21:25.326 --> 21:27.374
Oh, this is bad.

21:27.578 --> 21:28.955
Somethin's comin'.

21:29.121 --> 21:30.464
Somethin' big.

21:33.250 --> 21:34.923
Quick, in here,
my darling.

21:35.127 --> 21:36.504
A moment alone at last.

21:36.712 --> 21:38.464
You can drop
the act, Trigger.

21:41.675 --> 21:43.643
They're seeing
activity on the machine.

21:43.803 --> 21:44.975
- It's go time.
- Roger that.

21:45.179 --> 21:46.931
Where's my phone?

21:47.139 --> 21:49.517
- I don't have it.
- Yes, you do. It was in your purse.

21:49.683 --> 21:51.526
So I'm just supposed to
hold onto everything for you?

21:51.727 --> 21:53.900
I asked you when
we were in the car.

21:54.104 --> 21:55.947
Why do we always
have to fight at parties?

21:57.399 --> 22:00.152
Not even gonna ask.
