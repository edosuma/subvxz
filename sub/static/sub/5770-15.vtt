07:53.211 --> 07:54.517
[knock at door]

07:54.561 --> 07:56.867
I BELIEVE CONGRATULATIONS
IS IN ORDER.

07:56.911 --> 07:58.782
YOUR VIDEO
WAS ON TOSH.0.

07:58.826 --> 08:01.219
HE CALLED YOU
HIS "FAT LOSER OF THE WEEK."

08:01.263 --> 08:03.004
THAT IS
INCREDIBLY HATEFUL.

08:03.047 --> 08:04.962
OH, NO. I THINK
HE WAS LAUGHING WITH YOU.

08:05.006 --> 08:07.225
THAT IS ENOUGH.
BEING A DOCTOR IN A DOG COSTUME

08:07.269 --> 08:08.879
CANNOT BE THE ONLY THING
THAT PEOPLE KNOW ABOUT ME.

08:08.923 --> 08:10.925
THAT'S NOT TRUE.
PEOPLE SAY YOU HAVE A JUICY ASS.

08:10.968 --> 08:12.187
WHAT?

08:12.230 --> 08:13.971
I DID NOT SAY THAT.
OTHER PEOPLE SAID IT.

08:14.015 --> 08:16.060
I JUST AGREED.

08:16.104 --> 08:17.366
I SAID IT.

08:17.409 --> 08:19.281
I WAS THE ONLY ONE
THAT SAID IT.

08:19.324 --> 08:20.282
YOU GONNA CALL THE POLICE?

08:20.325 --> 08:21.936
I NEED REDEMPTION.

08:21.979 --> 08:23.546
KIM KARDASHIAN
STARTED OUT WITH A SEX TAPE,

08:23.590 --> 08:25.243
BUT SHE DIDN'T STOP THERE
AND LET IT DEFINE HER.

08:25.287 --> 08:26.897
KIM KARDASHIAN
MADE A SEX TAPE?

08:26.941 --> 08:28.203
YES, EXACTLY.

08:28.246 --> 08:30.553
SO I JUST NEED TO RIDE OUT
THIS MINOR HUMILIATION

08:30.597 --> 08:32.555
UNTIL I FIND MY KANYE.

08:32.599 --> 08:36.211
HEL--YEAH, HELEN?
YES. I AM IN.

08:37.429 --> 08:38.605

08:43.348 --> 08:45.655
HELEN, I'M SORRY.
THIS IS DR. MINDY LAHIRI.

08:45.699 --> 08:47.527
WHAT I'M IN FOR
IS THAT TV SEGMENT

08:47.570 --> 08:48.789
THAT WE TALKED ABOUT.

08:48.832 --> 08:51.574
OKAY.
OKAY, GREAT.

08:51.618 --> 08:53.663
HEY, HOW DO YOU, UH, SPELL
"KARDASHIAN"?

08:53.707 --> 08:55.578
ARE YOU LOOKING UP
HER SEX TAPE?

08:55.622 --> 08:58.015
NO, I JUST WANTED TO SEE
WHAT SHE'S UP TO.

08:58.059 --> 08:59.060
I NEED YOU TO LEAVE.

09:01.628 --> 09:02.977
EVERYONE, HUGE NEWS--

09:03.020 --> 09:04.674
REALLY EXCITING NEWS.
STOP WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

09:04.718 --> 09:06.067
STOP WHAT YOU'RE DOING.
GATHER ROUND.

09:06.110 --> 09:07.851
PARKER, YOU CAN CONTINUE
TO TAKE OUT THE RECYCLING.

09:07.895 --> 09:09.549
YOU'RE NOT PART
OF THE CORE GROUP.

09:09.592 --> 09:13.770
I HAVE BEEN HAND-SELECTED TO BE
THE NEW MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT

09:13.814 --> 09:15.076
FOR THE CHANNEL 8 NEWS.

09:15.119 --> 09:16.599
[gasps]OH, MY GOD!

09:16.643 --> 09:18.296
YOU WERE BORN
FOR TV NEWS.

09:18.340 --> 09:19.994
HOW YOU'RE ALWAYS TAKING
UNDRAMATIC THINGS

09:20.037 --> 09:21.604
AND MAKING THEM DRAMATIC.I DON'T DO THAT.

09:21.648 --> 09:22.605
OR DO I?

09:22.649 --> 09:24.955
THIS IS--
THIS IS GREAT NEWS.

09:24.999 --> 09:27.044
YOU DESERVE THIS.
I'M SO GLAD IT'S YOU.

09:27.088 --> 09:29.525
NOW I'LL HAVE
TWO FAMOUS SIGNATURES

09:29.569 --> 09:30.613
FOR MY AUTOGRAPH BOOK--

09:30.657 --> 09:33.137
YOU AND MAYOR DAVID DINKINS.

09:33.181 --> 09:34.269
OKAY, MINDY, LOOK,

09:34.312 --> 09:36.271
I KNOW YOU'RE REALLY
EXCITED ABOUT THIS,

09:36.314 --> 09:38.229
BUT IF YOU WANT
MY OPINION--
I DON'T.

09:38.273 --> 09:41.102
CAN YOU GUYS BELIEVE IT?
ME, THE CHILD OF IMMIGRANTS--

09:41.145 --> 09:43.800
IS IT OFFENSIVE TO SAY
THAT I ONLY TRUST

09:43.844 --> 09:46.063
AN OLDER WHITE MAN
TO GIVE ME THE NEWS?

09:46.107 --> 09:47.499
YES.
VERY.

09:47.543 --> 09:49.110
MINDY, I DON'T KNOW
ABOUT THIS.

09:49.153 --> 09:50.328
LOOK, DANNY, I KNOW
THAT YOU ARE WORRIED

09:50.372 --> 09:51.939
THAT MY FAME
IS GONNA CHANGE THINGS.

09:51.982 --> 09:54.028
NO, I'M NOT.
AND, DANNY,
I'M MORE WORRIED FOR YOU.

09:54.071 --> 09:56.117
YOU ARE?YEAH. WHAT IF THERE'S SOME
UNFLATTERING HEADLINE,

09:56.160 --> 09:57.335
LIKE, "WHY IS SHE
WITH HIM?"

09:57.379 --> 09:58.859
AND WE'RE JUST WALKING
TO GET LUNCH?

09:58.902 --> 10:01.209
AND YOU'LL HAVE TO GET
TO KNOW MY BODYGUARD,

10:01.252 --> 10:02.776
D'NELL.

10:02.819 --> 10:04.516
AND, UH, THERE MIGHT BE
"CROTCHARAZZI."

10:04.560 --> 10:05.953
"CROTCHARAZZI"?

10:07.302 --> 10:08.825
[Mindy]
ERICA, SO YOU ARE TRYING

10:08.869 --> 10:10.479
TO TELL ME THAT YOU HAVE NEVER
HEARD OF A MAMMOGRAM.

10:10.522 --> 10:11.872
[high-pitched voice]
DOES IT HURT?

10:11.915 --> 10:12.960
THEY'RE NOT
THE MOST COMFORTABLE THINGS.

10:13.003 --> 10:14.744
[laughs goofily][laughs]

10:14.788 --> 10:16.137

10:19.140 --> 10:20.097
THIS IS HER SEGMENT.

10:20.141 --> 10:21.272
IT'S INFORMATIVE,

10:21.316 --> 10:22.709
[laughing]
BUT IT'S HILARIOUS.

10:22.752 --> 10:25.929
OKAY, THIS IS DR. CASTELLANO.
I WORK WITH HIM.

10:25.973 --> 10:26.974
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

10:27.017 --> 10:28.149
YOU'RE GONNA USE
THIS STUPID PUPPET?

10:28.192 --> 10:31.108
UH, ERICA IS
A BRILLIANT PUPPET,

10:31.152 --> 10:32.675
SHE'S JUST UNINFORMED
ABOUT WOMEN'S HEALTH,

10:32.719 --> 10:33.850
WHICH IS
WHERE I COME IN.

10:33.894 --> 10:35.069
OKAY, MINDY,
YOU GOTTA BE CAREFUL

10:35.112 --> 10:36.113
ABOUT THE LOCAL NEWS GAME.

10:36.157 --> 10:37.201
WHAT DO YOU KNOW
ABOUT LOCAL NEWS?

10:37.245 --> 10:39.508
LOCAL NEWS IS
THE ONLY NEWS I WATCH.

10:39.551 --> 10:40.988
I DON'T WANT TO HEAR
ABOUT THE SYRIAN REVOLUTION

10:41.031 --> 10:42.163
FROM BRIAN WILLIAMS.

10:42.206 --> 10:44.165
I WANT TO HEAR
ABOUT THE SYRIAN REVOLUTION

10:44.208 --> 10:47.081
FROM SOME SYRIAN GUY WHO OWNS
A LOCAL DUNKIN' DONUTS.

10:47.124 --> 10:48.735
THAT'S WHAT I WANT.
OKAY...

10:48.778 --> 10:50.475
IF YOU ARE GOING TO DENIGRATE
A LEGEND LIKE BRIAN WILLIAMS,

10:50.519 --> 10:51.563
ERICA AND I
WOULD LIKE YOU TO LEAVE.

10:51.607 --> 10:52.913
YOU LOOK LIKE A FOOL,

10:52.956 --> 10:54.697
AND THIS WHOLE PRACTICE
LOOKS LIKE A BAG OF JERKS,

10:54.741 --> 10:56.873
AND YOU KNOW WHAT, MINDY?
WE CAN'T AFFORD THAT.

10:58.701 --> 11:00.616
LOOK, DON'T WORRY, OKAY?
