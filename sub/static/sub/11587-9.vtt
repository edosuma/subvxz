DRIVING FOR THE M.E.'S OFFICE.

00:25.659 --> 00:27.695

A VERY SPECIAL GIRL.

01:22.350 --> 01:23.784

I FORGOT.

01:27.221 --> 01:28.889

03:12.493 --> 03:13.894

THE PRIEST.

03:13.927 --> 03:15.696

03:15.729 --> 03:17.398
HE JACKED THE PRIEST,
STOLE THE PRESENTS.

03:17.431 --> 03:20.401

- THAT'S FIN'S EX-WIFE.
SOMETHING'S WRONG.

03:52.333 --> 03:53.734
- MY BROTHER GOT ARRESTED.

03:53.767 --> 03:55.403
- I'LL LEAVE YOU TWO ALONE.

03:55.436 --> 03:57.705
- SAM?
WHAT'D HE DO THIS TIME?

03:57.738 --> 03:59.507
- NOTHING.

03:59.540 --> 04:00.841
THEY SAY HE CARJACKED
A PRIEST.

04:00.874 --> 04:03.944
VIGILANTES BEAT HIM UP.

04:03.977 --> 04:06.314
HE TURNED IT AROUND, FIN.

04:06.347 --> 04:09.016
ALL HE'S BEEN TALKING ABOUT
IS SPENDING HIS FIRST CHRISTMAS

04:09.049 --> 04:10.818
WITH HIS SON
IN SIX YEARS.

04:10.851 --> 04:12.553
- COME ON, HE'S BEEN ON PAROLE
NINE MONTHS.

04:12.586 --> 04:14.322
[cell phone jingles]
WHAT'D YOU EXPECT TO HAPPEN?

04:14.355 --> 04:17.358
- KEN, I'M SPEAKING
WITH YOUR FATHER NOW.

04:19.593 --> 04:21.529

GOT LOCKED UP AGAIN.

04:24.398 --> 04:27.401
LIKE YOU SAY,
FAMILY'S COMPLICATED.

05:16.817 --> 05:18.519
- YOU DIDN'T HAVE
TO COME WITH.

05:18.552 --> 05:20.688
- IT WAS EITHER YOU
OR THE MORGUE DRIVER.

05:20.721 --> 05:23.357
SO SAM'S ON PAROLE?
- SINCE MARCH.

05:23.391 --> 05:25.959
LAST SIX YEARS,
MORE IN THAN OUT.

05:25.993 --> 05:28.629
YOU KNOW, AUTO THEFT,
COUPLE OF B-AND-E'S.

05:28.662 --> 05:30.731
MY EX TRIES TO TELL ME
IT'S BECAUSE

05:30.764 --> 05:32.566
HE'S IN THE WRONG PLACE
AT THE WRONG TIME.

05:32.600 --> 05:34.101
- IT IS POSSIBLE.

05:34.134 --> 05:36.003
I MEAN, PEOPLE CAN CHANGE.

05:36.036 --> 05:39.039
- MAYBE, BUT YOU DON'T GET
YOUR ASS KICKED FOR NOTHING.

05:41.475 --> 05:42.843
- I'M GUILTY
OF BEING BLACK.

05:42.876 --> 05:46.747
THAT'S IT.

05:46.780 --> 05:48.749
FINE. I WAS IN A FIGHT.

05:48.782 --> 05:50.851
BUT I WAS TRYING
TO SAVE THAT PRIEST.

05:50.884 --> 05:53.787
THEY WERE CALLING HIM
SHORT EYES, CHOMO.

05:53.821 --> 05:54.922
- CHOMO?

05:54.955 --> 05:56.457
TERESA TOLD YOU
I WAS IN SVU,

05:56.490 --> 05:57.725
SO YOU MADE THAT UP.

05:57.758 --> 05:59.727
- IT'S THE TRUTH.

05:59.760 --> 06:00.894
I SAW THEM
BEATING THE PRIEST

06:00.928 --> 06:02.596
AND THIS KID
RUNNING AWAY.

06:02.630 --> 06:05.032
- OKAY, THE KID--
WHAT'D HE LOOK LIKE?

06:05.065 --> 06:08.702
- SHE.
YOUNG. MAYBE EIGHT, NINE.

06:08.736 --> 06:11.038
HISPANIC. LONG HAIR.
CUTE.

06:11.071 --> 06:13.474
HEY, NOT ALL PRIESTS
LIKE BOYS.

06:13.507 --> 06:15.743
- DID YOU SEE HIM DO ANYTHING
TO THE GIRL?

06:15.776 --> 06:18.512
- I SAW THESE TWO GUYS
KICKING HIS HEAD IN.

06:18.546 --> 06:19.780
THEY WERE GONNA KILL HIM.

06:19.813 --> 06:21.915
- UH-HUH.
- I SWEAR.

06:21.949 --> 06:23.817
I DON'T NEED A CAR.

06:23.851 --> 06:25.686
I DON'T WANT TO GET SENT
BACK TO PRISON.

06:25.719 --> 06:28.155
WHY WOULD I DO THIS?

06:28.188 --> 06:30.791
HEY.

06:30.824 --> 06:33.093
I GOTTA GET HOME
FOR CHRISTMAS.

06:33.126 --> 06:35.463
- IT'S A RIGHTEOUS COLLAR.

06:35.496 --> 06:37.798
WE GOT TWO 911 CALLS SAYING
A PRIEST IS ON THE GROUND.

06:37.831 --> 06:40.200
NEIGHBORHOOD GUYS STOP A BLACK
MAN FROM STEALING HIS CAR.

06:40.233 --> 06:42.035
WITNESSES ON THE SCENE
CONFIRM.

06:42.069 --> 06:44.104
- MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT.
WITNESSES CAN BE WRONG.

06:44.137 --> 06:46.139
- ALL OF THEM?
- THANKS, OFFICER.

06:46.173 --> 06:48.876
- NO, NO, WHAT ABOUT THE GUYS
THAT ATTACKED SAM?

06:48.909 --> 06:50.911
- THEY TOOK OFF
WHEN THEY HEARD SIRENS.

06:50.944 --> 06:52.513
- GOOD SAMARITANS
ARE NOT GONNA STICK AROUND?

06:52.546 --> 06:54.815
COME ON.
DID THE PRIEST I.D. SAM?

06:54.848 --> 06:55.949
- FATHER'S STILL UNCONSCIOUS.

06:55.983 --> 06:57.585
HE HAD HIS HEAD BASHED IN.

06:57.618 --> 06:59.119
- DID ANYBODY TALK
TO THE GIRL?

06:59.152 --> 07:00.954
- WHAT GIRL?
- WE HEARD THAT THERE WAS

07:00.988 --> 07:02.189
A GIRL WITH THE PRIEST.

07:02.222 --> 07:03.724
SHE RAN FROM THE CAR
WHEN THEY--

07:03.757 --> 07:05.125
- I DIDN'T HEAR ANYTHING
ABOUT A GIRL, OKAY?

07:05.158 --> 07:06.560
- THANKS, OFFICER.

07:06.594 --> 07:07.661
LET IT GO, AMANDA.

07:07.695 --> 07:10.731
COME ON.
LET'S GO.

07:12.199 --> 07:14.502
- OH, THEY GOT BLOOD
ALL OVER THE HOOD.

07:14.535 --> 07:16.136
- SO MUCH FOR LETTING IT GO.

07:16.169 --> 07:18.105
- HOW'S IT LOOKING
FOR YOUR BROTHER-IN-LAW?

07:18.138 --> 07:19.540
- IT IS WHAT IT IS.

07:19.573 --> 07:20.641
- THERE ARE
SOME INCONSISTENCIES.

07:20.674 --> 07:22.042
I MEAN,
THE GIRL SAM MENTIONED--

07:22.075 --> 07:23.644
- COULD'VE MADE HER UP.

07:23.677 --> 07:25.513
- THE VIGILANTES,
IF THAT'S WHAT THEY WERE,

07:25.546 --> 07:26.814
DISAPPEARED.

07:26.847 --> 07:29.049
WE'VE GOT NO STATEMENT
FROM THE VIC.

07:29.082 --> 07:30.584
DID YOU GUYS NOSE AROUND?

07:30.618 --> 07:31.852
- YEAH, I TALKED
TO THE 9-1-1 CALLERS.

07:31.885 --> 07:33.721
THEY BOTH SAW
THE BLACK MAN'S FACE.

07:33.754 --> 07:34.788
- YEAH, THEY COULDN'T I.D.
THE NEIGHBORHOOD GUYS

07:34.822 --> 07:36.156
WHO BEAT HIM UP.

07:36.189 --> 07:37.891
- EVIDENCE DIDN'T SAY
MUCH EITHER.

07:37.925 --> 07:40.160
CAR HADN'T BEEN PROCESSED.

07:40.193 --> 07:42.129
- C.S.U. DIDN'T COVER
THE SCENE?

07:42.162 --> 07:43.797
- A CARJACKING
TWO DAYS BEFORE CHRISTMAS?

07:43.831 --> 07:45.766
NOT LIKELY.

07:45.799 --> 07:47.568
- OKAY, SO LET'S ASK WARNER

07:47.601 --> 07:50.237
IF SHE CAN BACKDOOR IT
AND SEND TECHS.

07:50.270 --> 07:52.139
- LOOK, LIV,
I APPRECIATE THE HELP,

07:52.172 --> 07:53.807
BUT I DIVORCED INTO THIS.

07:53.841 --> 07:55.208
NO NEED TO DRAG YOU INTO IT.
- SCREW YOU, FIN.

07:55.242 --> 07:57.210
I'M ALL YOURS
TILL CHRISTMAS EVE.

07:57.244 --> 07:58.779
AFTER THAT,
YOU'RE ON YOUR OWN.

07:58.812 --> 08:01.815
- HEY. MIGHT HAVE SOMETHING.

08:04.051 --> 08:05.653
SIGNED "SOFIA".

08:05.686 --> 08:07.688
- SO WHEN SAM SAID
HE SAW A LITTLE GIRL,

08:07.721 --> 08:09.757
HE COULD'VE BEEN TELLING
THE TRUTH.

08:09.790 --> 08:13.627
- THAT DOESN'T PROVE ANYTHING.

08:13.661 --> 08:16.263
- THAT MIGHT.

08:16.296 --> 08:18.298
- ALL RIGHT,
SO HERE WE'VE GOT THE PRIEST.

08:18.331 --> 08:20.033
AND THEN...

08:20.067 --> 08:21.769
HERE COMES THE LITTLE GIRL.

08:21.802 --> 08:24.204
- SOFIA.

08:24.237 --> 08:25.773
- AND THEN HERE WE ARE.

08:25.806 --> 08:28.108
WE'VE GOT TWO MALES
IN HOODIES.

08:28.141 --> 08:31.311
- THERE'S YOUR BROTHER-IN-LAW.

08:31.344 --> 08:32.746
FIN, SAM COULD BE TELLING
THE TRUTH.

08:32.780 --> 08:34.314
THIS FITS HIS TIMELINE.

08:34.347 --> 08:35.883
- YEAH, BUT THE ASSAULT
IS OFF CAMERA.

08:35.916 --> 08:37.918
THIS DOESN'T PROVE ANYTHING.

08:37.951 --> 08:39.653
- OKAY.

08:39.687 --> 08:41.789
SAM SAID THAT THEY CALLED
FATHER SHEA A PEDOPHILE.

08:41.822 --> 08:44.224
WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT HIM?
- FATHER CHRIS SHEA

08:44.257 --> 08:46.259
WAS TRANSFERRED TO AN ORPHANAGE
IN GUATEMALA FOUR YEARS AGO.

08:46.293 --> 08:48.596
HE WAS ORDAINED MAY OF '96.

08:48.629 --> 08:49.797
- WHERE WAS HE
BEFORE GUATEMALA?

08:49.830 --> 08:52.966
- UH, BOSTON, CHICAGO,
STATEN ISLAND.

08:53.000 --> 08:55.335
HE WAS A PRISON CHAPLAIN,
AND THEN TEN YEARS AGO,

08:55.368 --> 08:57.170
HE WAS AT ST. HORATIO'S
UP IN INWOOD.

08:57.204 --> 09:00.774
- OKAY, SO WE HAVE A PRIEST
WHO MOVED AROUND A LOT,

09:00.808 --> 09:02.810
WHO'S ALONE AT NIGHT
IN A CAR WITH A GIRL.

09:02.843 --> 09:04.645
[cell phone chimes]

09:04.678 --> 09:07.180
- LOOK, PRIESTS GET TRANSFERRED
FOR A LOT OF REASONS.

09:07.214 --> 09:09.116
YOUNG FATHER LIKE THAT,
YOU KNOW,

09:09.149 --> 09:10.851
SOMETIMES THE OLD GUARD
FEELS THREATENED.

09:10.884 --> 09:12.853
THEY DON'T WANT TO LOSE CONTROL
OF THEIR PARISH.

09:12.886 --> 09:14.221
- SO WHAT'S OUR NEXT MOVE?

09:14.254 --> 09:16.056
HOW DO WE TRACK DOWN THE GIRL
AND THE TWO GUYS?

09:16.089 --> 09:17.324
- WE MAY HAVE
A BREAK RIGHT HERE.

09:17.357 --> 09:19.059
THE HOSPITAL JUST CALLED
AND SAID

09:19.092 --> 09:20.694
FATHER SHEA
REGAINED CONSCIOUSNESS.

09:20.728 --> 09:21.929
- GREAT. I'LL GO TALK TO HIM.

09:21.962 --> 09:23.697
- HEY, NO, LIV,
IT MIGHT BE A BETTER IDEA

09:23.731 --> 09:25.666
IF ME AND FIN TALK
TO THE PRIEST

09:25.699 --> 09:27.267
AND YOU AND ROLLINS PAY A VISIT
TO YOUR OLD PAL

09:27.300 --> 09:29.737
D.A. BARBA,
SHOW HIM THAT VIDEO.

09:29.770 --> 09:31.705
- WELL, WE COULD, IF HE WEREN'T
SKIING IN GSTAAD.

09:31.739 --> 09:33.941
- GSTAAD? REALLY?

09:33.974 --> 09:35.643
OKAY.

09:35.676 --> 09:37.177
SO HOW 'BOUT
GEORGIA PEACH AND I

09:37.210 --> 09:40.881
GO SWEET-TALK WHATEVER
UNLUCKY JUNIOR A.D.A.

09:40.914 --> 09:43.917
GOT STUCK
WITH THE HOLIDAY WEEKEND?

09:45.919 --> 09:47.688
- YOU WANT ME TO R.O.R.
A TWO-TIME FELON ON PAROLE?

09:47.721 --> 09:49.757
- LOOK, WE HAVE
A SECURITY VIDEO

09:49.790 --> 09:51.058
THAT PARTIALLY CONFIRMS
SAM'S STORY.

09:51.091 --> 09:53.326
- PARTIALLY?
I'VE BEEN HERE TWO MONTHS.

09:53.360 --> 09:55.696
- WHERE'S YOUR SUPERVISOR?

09:55.729 --> 09:57.831
- ARE EITHER OF YOU
THE ARRESTING OFFICER?

09:57.865 --> 09:59.667
I DIDN'T THINK SO.

09:59.700 --> 10:01.635
AND LAST I HEARD,
CARJACKING WASN'T A SEX CRIME.

10:01.669 --> 10:02.970
WHAT IS THIS ABOUT?

10:03.003 --> 10:05.272
- COUNSELOR...

10:05.305 --> 10:06.707
THE SUSPECT IS FAMILY.

10:06.740 --> 10:08.108
- I SEE.

10:08.141 --> 10:10.343
YOU SHOULD'VE KEPT THAT
TO YOURSELF.

10:10.377 --> 10:14.882
GOOD DAY, LADIES.

10:14.915 --> 10:18.285
- SO MUCH FOR SWEET TALK.

10:18.318 --> 10:20.020
- I GOT JUMPED.

10:20.053 --> 10:22.690
THIS SORT OF THING HAPPENS
AT CHRISTMAS.

10:22.723 --> 10:25.693
PEOPLE SEE THINGS
THEY CAN'T AFFORD,

10:25.726 --> 10:28.962
GIFTS FOR THE FAMILY,
AND, WELL...

10:28.996 --> 10:31.999
I'M NOT TELLING YOU
ANYTHING YOU DON'T KNOW.

10:32.032 --> 10:34.234
WHOEVER DID THIS,
I FORGIVE HIM.

10:34.267 --> 10:36.003
IT'S DONE.

10:36.036 --> 10:38.138
- FATHER, IT'S NOT DONE.

10:38.171 --> 10:39.673
WE HAVE A SUSPECT
IN CUSTODY.

10:39.707 --> 10:41.008
WE NEED YOU TO I.D. HIM.

10:41.041 --> 10:43.744
- NO, I'M NOT INTERESTED
IN PRESSING CHARGES.

10:43.777 --> 10:45.979
- FATHER, JUST TAKE A LOOK
AT THESE PICTURES, OKAY?

10:46.013 --> 10:48.716
DO YOU RECOGNIZE
ANY OF THESE MEN?

10:48.749 --> 10:50.884
- YES.
OH, I RECOGNIZE HIM.

10:50.918 --> 10:52.786
- IS THAT THE GUY
THAT BEAT YOU UP?

10:52.820 --> 10:54.054
- NO, THIS WAS
A GOOD SAMARITAN.

10:54.087 --> 10:56.423
HE PULLED THE OTHERS
OFF OF ME.

10:56.456 --> 10:58.291
- ARE YOU SURE?
- YES, ABSOLUTELY.

10:58.325 --> 10:59.960
HE SAVED ME FROM THEM.

10:59.993 --> 11:02.362
- OKAY.
SAVED YOU FROM WHOM?

11:02.395 --> 11:04.064
- [stammers, exhales]

11:04.097 --> 11:06.934
I DON'T KNOW.

11:06.967 --> 11:09.136
I THINK THERE WERE TWO
OF THEM.

11:09.169 --> 11:11.071
I COULDN'T MAKE OUT
THEIR FACES.

11:11.104 --> 11:14.307
- RIGHT. YOU SAID IT WAS
AN ATTEMPTED ROBBERY,

11:14.341 --> 11:16.777
BUT DID YOU HEAR ANYONE
CALLING YOU NAMES?

11:16.810 --> 11:19.980
MAYBE CHOMO, SHORT EYES?

11:20.013 --> 11:21.481
- NO.

11:21.514 --> 11:23.383
- MAYBE THE LITTLE GIRL
CAN CLEAR THAT UP.

11:23.416 --> 11:24.918
- THE ONE IN YOUR CAR.
WE HAVE HER ON VIDEO.

11:24.952 --> 11:28.388
SHE GAVE YOU A CARD.
SOFIA.

11:28.421 --> 11:30.390
CAN WE ASK WHY YOU WERE
ALONE WITH HER

11:30.423 --> 11:33.226
IN YOUR CAR AT NIGHT?

11:33.260 --> 11:35.228
- I VISITED HER
AT HER APARTMENT,

11:35.262 --> 11:36.764
GAVE HER A GIFT.

11:36.797 --> 11:39.032
SHE CAME BACK DOWN
TO GIVE ME A CARD.

11:39.066 --> 11:41.769
- HOW WELL DO YOU KNOW HER?

11:41.802 --> 11:43.737
- SHE'S INNOCENT
OF ANY OF THIS.

11:43.771 --> 11:45.839
I DON'T--I DON'T THINK
SHE SAW ANYTHING.

11:45.873 --> 11:46.940
- WE'LL NEED HER
TO CONFIRM THAT.

11:46.974 --> 11:48.475
WHAT WAS HER LAST NAME?

11:48.508 --> 11:50.744
- SOFIA SANTIAGO.

11:50.778 --> 11:54.314
HER MOTHER, MARGARITA, IS
THE SECRETARY AT ST. HORATIO'S.

11:54.347 --> 11:56.283
RITA CAN CONFIRM
ALL OF THIS.

11:56.316 --> 11:57.985
- SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE STILL
INVOLVED WITH THE PARISH.

11:58.018 --> 11:59.219
YOU LEFT TEN YEARS AGO.

11:59.252 --> 12:00.821
- I COME BACK
AT HOLIDAY TIMES

12:00.854 --> 12:02.122
TO VISIT MY SISTER,

12:02.155 --> 12:04.892
LOOK IN
ON MY OLD PARISHIONERS.

12:04.925 --> 12:06.126
IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE?

12:06.159 --> 12:07.527
- YEAH. THE MAN THAT SAVED YOU,

12:07.560 --> 12:09.429
SAM RANDALL,

12:09.462 --> 12:12.465
NEEDS YOU TO RETURN
THE FAVOR.

12:15.135 --> 12:16.870
- HOW DO YOU PLEAD?
- NOT GUILTY, YOUR HONOR.

12:16.904 --> 12:19.773
- COUNSELOR, CAN WE HAVE
A MINUTE WITH YOU?

12:19.807 --> 12:21.041
IT'S ABOUT THIS CASE.

12:21.074 --> 12:22.442
- IS THERE A PROBLEM HERE?

12:22.475 --> 12:23.844
- I'M NOT SURE, YOUR HONOR.

12:23.877 --> 12:25.813
CAN I ASK YOUR INDULGENCE
FOR A MOMENT?

12:25.846 --> 12:28.115
- YEAH.

12:28.148 --> 12:29.482
LET ME GUESS.

12:29.516 --> 12:30.818
MORE SVU DETECTIVES.

12:30.851 --> 12:32.820
- WE HAVE A STATEMENT
FROM FATHER SHEA

12:32.853 --> 12:34.154
CONFIRMING SAM IS NOT
HIS ASSAILANT.

12:34.187 --> 12:36.489
- SAM, I SUPPOSE,
IS YOUR RELATIVE?

12:36.523 --> 12:37.524
- JUST LOOK AT THE STATEMENT.

12:37.557 --> 12:39.226
- I DON'T KNOW YOU.

12:39.259 --> 12:40.493
I DON'T KNOW IF THE VICTIM
WAS PRESSURED

12:40.527 --> 12:41.829
INTO MAKING THIS STATEMENT.

12:41.862 --> 12:43.363
I CAN'T SHOW THIS
TO THE JUDGE.

12:43.396 --> 12:44.898
HAVE YOU SPOKEN WITH
THE ARRESTING OFFICER?

12:44.932 --> 12:46.033
- YEAH, WE TRIED.

12:46.066 --> 12:47.334
BUT HE LEFT FOR
THE DOMINICAN REPUBLIC

12:47.367 --> 12:48.869
FOR THE HOLIDAYS,
COUNSELOR.

12:48.902 --> 12:50.170
- TERRIFIC.

12:50.203 --> 12:51.571
WHEN HE GETS BACK,
I'LL SPEAK WITH HIM.

12:51.604 --> 12:54.407
- WHILE AN INNOCENT MAN
SPENDS CHRISTMAS IN JAIL.

12:54.441 --> 12:56.844
HE WAS ARRESTED WHILE ON
PAROLE, DETECTIVE.

12:56.877 --> 13:00.180
END OF STORY.

13:00.213 --> 13:02.182
THANK YOU FOR YOUR PATIENCE,
YOUR HONOR.

13:02.215 --> 13:04.918
- I HAVE A PLEA OF NOT GUILTY.
PEOPLE ON BAIL?

13:04.952 --> 13:07.387
- DEFENDANT HAS
THREE PRIOR CONVICTIONS,

13:07.420 --> 13:09.289
IS CURRENTLY ON PAROLE,
AND IS ACCUSED

13:09.322 --> 13:11.458
OF A BRUTAL ASSAULT
AGAINST A CLERGYMAN

13:11.491 --> 13:12.926
WHO IS STILL HOSPITALIZED.

13:12.960 --> 13:15.262
THE PEOPLE REQUEST REMAND.

13:15.295 --> 13:17.030
- GRANTED.

13:17.064 --> 13:18.565
SCHEDULE A PRE-TRIAL HEARING
WITH THE COURT CLERK

13:18.598 --> 13:21.034
FOR AFTER THE HOLIDAYS.

13:21.068 --> 13:22.602
MERRY CHRISTMAS, EVERYONE.

13:22.635 --> 13:24.905
[bangs gavel]

13:24.938 --> 13:25.939
- DAD!

13:25.973 --> 13:27.574
- I'M SORRY, DANTE.

13:27.607 --> 13:29.843
- WHOA.

13:29.877 --> 13:32.512
- DANTE, YOU REMEMBER
YOUR UNCLE FIN?

13:32.545 --> 13:35.015
- MY DAD DIDN'T DO IT.

13:35.048 --> 13:37.484
- I KNOW. HE DID THE RIGHT THING
THIS TIME.

13:37.517 --> 13:40.487
- SO PROMISE
YOU'LL GET HIM OUT.

13:47.961 --> 13:50.330
- ALL DANTE WANTED
FOR CHRISTMAS WAS HIS FATHER.

13:50.363 --> 13:51.932
SO WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN NOW?

13:51.965 --> 13:53.300
- WE'RE WORKING ON IT.

13:53.333 --> 13:56.203
- SAM WAS JUST TRYING
TO HELP THAT PRIEST.

13:56.236 --> 13:57.637
- HE'S ON PAROLE.

13:57.670 --> 14:00.073
YOU DON'T JUMP IN.
YOU CALL 911.

14:00.107 --> 14:02.242
- ALL RIGHT, FIN.

14:02.275 --> 14:05.345
I'LL TAKE DANTE HOME.

14:05.378 --> 14:07.547
- THAT A.D.A.'S NOT GONNA TAKE
OUR WORD FOR IT.

14:07.580 --> 14:09.950
- WELL, HE MIGHT BEND
IF WE CAN FIND THE TWO GUYS

14:09.983 --> 14:11.885
WHO ACTUALLY ASSAULTED
FATHER SHEA.

14:11.919 --> 14:13.420
THE GIRL IN THE CAR, SOFIA,

14:13.453 --> 14:16.456
MAYBE SHE SAW SOMETHING.

14:18.591 --> 14:20.894
- MARGARITA SANTIAGO
IS MY SECRETARY.

14:20.928 --> 14:22.462
CAN I ASK
WHAT THIS IS ABOUT?

14:22.495 --> 14:25.265
- YEAH, WE'RE INVESTIGATING
THE ATTACK ON FATHER SHEA.

14:25.298 --> 14:27.267
- MM. HOME FOR THE HOLIDAYS.

14:27.300 --> 14:29.202
TERRIBLE WHAT HAPPENED.

14:29.236 --> 14:32.172
I'M NOT SURE HOW
MS. SANTIAGO COULD HELP YOU.

14:32.205 --> 14:33.540
FATHER SHEA HASN'T BEEN
WITH THIS PARISH

14:33.573 --> 14:35.208
FOR A LONG TIME.

14:35.242 --> 14:37.444
- YEAH, CAN YOU TELL US
WHY HE LEFT ST. HORATIO'S?

14:37.477 --> 14:39.479
- UNFORTUNATELY, OUR PARISH
HAS BEEN SHRINKING

14:39.512 --> 14:41.214
OVER THE YEARS.

14:41.248 --> 14:45.185
THE CHURCH FELT THE NEED
WAS GREATER ELSEWHERE.

14:45.218 --> 14:48.455
EXCUSE ME.

14:48.488 --> 14:51.224
MARGARITA, THESE DETECTIVES
NEED TO SPEAK WITH YOU

14:51.258 --> 14:52.592
ABOUT FATHER SHEA.

14:52.625 --> 14:55.228
- OH, OF COURSE.

14:55.262 --> 14:57.297
- PLEASE LET ME KNOW IF THERE'S
ANYTHING I CAN DO TO HELP.

14:57.330 --> 15:00.467
- THANK YOU, MONSIGNOR.

15:00.500 --> 15:02.669
- I WAS HORRIFIED
WHEN I HEARD WHAT HAPPENED.

15:02.702 --> 15:04.204
IS THE FATHER ALL RIGHT?

15:04.237 --> 15:05.272
- HE'S RECOVERING.

15:05.305 --> 15:07.640
- WE UNDERSTAND
THAT YOUR DAUGHTER

15:07.674 --> 15:09.342
WAS WITH FATHER SHEA
LAST NIGHT.

15:09.376 --> 15:10.477
CAN YOU TELL US WHY?

15:10.510 --> 15:12.479
- FATHER SHEA
HAD GIVEN HER A PRESENT.

15:12.512 --> 15:14.547
IT'S CHRISTMAS.

15:14.581 --> 15:16.016
HE HAD GIVEN PRESENTS
TO ALL THE CHILDREN

15:16.049 --> 15:17.317
IN THE PARISH.

15:17.350 --> 15:18.986
HE JUST--
HE LOVES KIDS.

15:19.019 --> 15:20.420
- HOW OLD IS YOUR DAUGHTER?

15:20.453 --> 15:22.189
- NINE.
- AND HAS SHE EVER BEEN

15:22.222 --> 15:23.723
ALONE WITH FATHER SHEA
BEFORE?

15:23.756 --> 15:25.225
- YES, SOMETIMES.

15:25.258 --> 15:28.328
UH, SHE'S KNOWN HIM FOR YEARS.

15:28.361 --> 15:29.729
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

15:29.762 --> 15:33.200
- UH, HIS, UH, ATTACKERS
MAY HAVE THOUGHT

15:33.233 --> 15:36.603
HE WAS BEING INAPPROPRIATE
WITH YOUR DAUGHTER.

15:36.636 --> 15:38.138
- NO, HE WOULD NEVER.

15:38.171 --> 15:39.706
THAT'S RIDICULOUS.

15:39.739 --> 15:42.209
- THE MEN WHO BEAT HIM UP,
THEY CALLED HIM A PEDOPHILE.

15:42.242 --> 15:43.576
- WELL, THEY'RE WRONG.

15:43.610 --> 15:45.312
I MEAN, JUST BECAUSE
OF A FEW PRIESTS,

15:45.345 --> 15:47.747
EVERYONE ASSUMES THE WORST.

15:47.780 --> 15:50.750
FATHER SHEA TAKES AN INTEREST
IN SOFIA.

15:50.783 --> 15:54.421
HER BIOLOGICAL FATHER
WAS NEVER...INVOLVED.

15:54.454 --> 15:56.723
IT'S GOOD FOR HER.

15:56.756 --> 15:58.225
YOU'VE GOT HIM ALL WRONG.

15:58.258 --> 16:00.093
- OKAY, MS. SANTIAGO,

16:00.127 --> 16:03.530
BUT WE'RE GONNA STILL NEED
TO SPEAK WITH SOFIA.

16:03.563 --> 16:06.633
- SHE'S BEEN VERY UPSET.

16:06.666 --> 16:09.602
I WAS LUCKY TO GET HER
TO THE CHILDREN'S MASS.

16:09.636 --> 16:11.304
LET ME SEE
IF SHE'S UP TO IT.

16:11.338 --> 16:14.141
- OKAY.

16:14.174 --> 16:16.243
I'VE SEEN THIS BEFORE.

16:16.276 --> 16:17.577
A MOTHER WHO DOESN'T WANT
TO ADMIT

16:17.610 --> 16:19.512
THAT SHE PUT HER CHILD
IN DANGER,

16:19.546 --> 16:22.382
SO SHE DENIES, DENIES, DENIES.

16:22.415 --> 16:24.284
- WELL, NOT EVERYONE'S
IN DENIAL, LIV.

16:24.317 --> 16:26.786
SOMETIMES PEOPLE ARE
JUST INNOCENT.

16:26.819 --> 16:28.421
- ARE YOU GONNA TELL ME

16:28.455 --> 16:30.323
THAT YOU DON'T THINK
SHE'S HIDING SOMETHING?

16:30.357 --> 16:31.624
- WE DON'T KNOW WHAT,
IS ALL I'M SAYING.

16:31.658 --> 16:33.393
- [sighs]

16:33.426 --> 16:35.195
- I'M NOT PROTECTING
THE CATHOLIC CHURCH,

16:35.228 --> 16:36.563
IF THAT'S WHAT YOU THINK.

16:36.596 --> 16:38.231
- NICK, THAT'S NOT WHAT
I SAID.

16:38.265 --> 16:40.200
- YEAH.

16:40.233 --> 16:42.635
- UM, SOFIA WILL TALK
TO YOU,

16:42.669 --> 16:45.438
BUT I WANT TO BE IN THE ROOM.
- THAT'S FINE.

16:45.472 --> 16:48.441
- SOFIA, DO YOU KNOW
WHY WE'RE HERE?

16:48.475 --> 16:51.178
- BECAUSE FATHER SHEA
GOT BEAT UP.

16:51.211 --> 16:53.246
- RIGHT.

16:53.280 --> 16:55.048
SO LET'S TAKE IT
FROM THE BEGINNING.

16:55.082 --> 16:58.751
UM, WHY WERE YOU IN HIS CAR?

16:58.785 --> 17:01.288
- HE CAME TO OUR APARTMENT.

17:01.321 --> 17:02.522
HE GAVE ME A DOLL.

17:02.555 --> 17:06.326
SHE LOOKED JUST LIKE ME
WITH LONG HAIR.

17:06.359 --> 17:10.297
HE LEFT, BUT I FORGOT
TO GIVE HIM HIS CHRISTMAS CARD,

17:10.330 --> 17:12.332
SO I BROUGHT IT
TO HIS CAR.

17:12.365 --> 17:16.269
- SO FATHER SHEA TREATS YOU
PRETTY SPECIAL, HUH?

17:16.303 --> 17:19.372
- HE'S A KIND MAN
TO EVERYONE, RIGHT, SOFIA?

17:19.406 --> 17:22.309
- YES.
- OKAY.

17:22.342 --> 17:25.212
SO, SOFIA,
YOU MUST'VE BEEN UPSET

17:25.245 --> 17:27.214
WHEN FATHER SHEA GOT HURT.

17:27.247 --> 17:30.683
CAN YOU TELL US
WHAT HAPPENED?

17:30.717 --> 17:32.852
- FATHER SHEA LIKED
THE CARD.

17:32.885 --> 17:34.854
HE WAS SO HAPPY.

17:34.887 --> 17:37.357
HE GAVE ME A HUG.

17:37.390 --> 17:40.360
- DID IT GO ON
FOR A LONG TIME?

17:40.393 --> 17:42.295
- [sighs]
NO.

17:42.329 --> 17:45.198
THAT'S WHEN THE MAN
BROKE THE WINDOW.

17:45.232 --> 17:47.534
THEN THE OTHER MAN
DRAGGED HIM OUT.

17:47.567 --> 17:49.569
FATHER SHEA TOLD ME
TO RUN.

17:49.602 --> 17:53.873
- AND CAN YOU DESCRIBE
THESE MEN?

17:53.906 --> 17:57.277
- MM, THE BAD GUYS
SPOKE SPANISH.

17:57.310 --> 17:58.845
THEY WERE WEARING HOODIES.

17:58.878 --> 18:01.614
- THE--THE BAD GUYS?

18:01.648 --> 18:03.350
WAS THERE A GOOD GUY?

18:03.383 --> 18:05.318
- YES.

18:05.352 --> 18:06.753
HE WAS BLACK.

18:06.786 --> 18:09.322
HE TRIED TO SAVE
FATHER SHEA.

18:12.725 --> 18:14.227
- YOU OWE ME FOR DOING
NYPD'S JOB.

18:14.261 --> 18:16.429
- WE ALWAYS OWE YOU.
- [laughs]

18:16.463 --> 18:19.832
- ANY DNA MATCHES FROM THE BLOOD
ON FATHER SHEA'S CAR?

18:19.866 --> 18:21.834
- STILL RUNNING THAT,
BUT THE BLOOD TRACES

18:21.868 --> 18:24.271
ARE FROM
THREE DIFFERENT MALES.

18:24.304 --> 18:26.239
- THAT BACKS UP SAM'S STORY.
- BUT IT DOESN'T GET US

18:26.273 --> 18:27.707
ANY CLOSER
TO FINDING THE PERPS.

18:27.740 --> 18:29.342
- THIS WILL.

18:29.376 --> 18:32.312
PRINTS FROM THE CAR DOOR HANDLE
MATCH AN ADAM BENITEZ,

18:32.345 --> 18:34.914
CONVICTED TWICE FOR ASSAULTING
REGISTERED SEX OFFENDERS.

18:34.947 --> 18:36.883
- BUT FATHER SHEA
WAS NEVER ACCUSED.

18:36.916 --> 18:39.852
- MAYBE BENITEZ
KNOWS SOMETHING WE DON'T.

18:39.886 --> 18:41.221
THANK YOU, MELINDA.

18:41.254 --> 18:44.324
- MERRY CHRISTMAS,
DETECTIVE TUTUOLA.

18:46.459 --> 18:48.328
- HO, HO, HO.

18:48.361 --> 18:51.164
- WHICH ONE IS BENITEZ?

18:51.198 --> 18:52.799
- IT'S HARD TO TELL
WITH ALL THE SANTA SUITS.

18:52.832 --> 18:55.235
HIS FACEBOOK PAGE SAID
HE'D BE WORKING THIS CORNER.

18:55.268 --> 18:57.704
[bells ringing]

18:57.737 --> 19:02.242
- HO, HO--
- ADAM BENITEZ?

19:02.275 --> 19:06.179
- STOP, POLICE!

19:06.213 --> 19:08.815
- [grunts]

19:08.848 --> 19:11.218
ARRESTING SANTA?
COME ON!

19:11.251 --> 19:13.186
- SHOULD'VE CALLED
YOUR REINDEER.

19:13.220 --> 19:16.789
- AGH.
- LET'S GO.

19:16.823 --> 19:18.458
- I'VE READ
YOUR SENTENCING REPORTS, ADAM.

19:18.491 --> 19:20.393
YOU WERE ABUSED
WHEN YOU WERE EIGHT?

19:20.427 --> 19:23.430
- MY UNCLE.
HE WAS A TRANSIT COP.

19:23.463 --> 19:26.699
I WAS ALREADY A TRUANT.
NO ONE BELIEVED ME.

19:26.733 --> 19:27.967
- THAT'S WHERE YOU GOT
THE HABIT

19:28.000 --> 19:29.402
OF POUNDING ON PEDOPHILES?

19:29.436 --> 19:30.470
- I DON'T FEEL BAD
ABOUT IT.

19:30.503 --> 19:32.372
- AND YOU THINK FATHER SHEA
IS ONE?

19:32.405 --> 19:34.841
DID YOU SEE HIM
ABUSING THE GIRL?

19:34.874 --> 19:36.343
- HE WAS HUGGING HER
WHEN WE GOT THERE.

19:36.376 --> 19:39.379
- WE? WHO'S WE?
- A FRIEND.

19:39.412 --> 19:41.281
PRIEST DID HIS SISTER UGLY.

19:41.314 --> 19:43.783
HE HEARD THE FATHER
WAS HOME FOR THE HOLIDAYS.

19:43.816 --> 19:45.518
WE WERE WATCHING HIM.

19:45.552 --> 19:49.322
- SO IT WAS HIS IDEA.

19:49.356 --> 19:52.392
WE COULD HELP YOU, ADAM.

19:52.425 --> 19:54.227
- THIS FRIEND GOT A NAME?
- [chuckles]

19:54.261 --> 19:56.296
WE PLAYING LET'S MAKE A DEAL,
CHRISTMAS EDITION?

19:56.329 --> 19:58.398
THIS WOULD BE A GOOD TIME
TO CALL A LAWYER, RIGHT?

20:02.635 --> 20:06.373
- ENRIQUE RODRIGUEZ...
HANDS UP.

20:06.406 --> 20:08.007
- YOU'RE UNDER ARREST
FOR THE ASSAULT

20:08.040 --> 20:09.709
OF FATHER CHRIS SHEA.

20:09.742 --> 20:12.312
- HE RAPES LITTLE GIRLS,
AND I GET ARRESTED?

20:12.345 --> 20:15.282
- YOU MEAN YOUR SISTER?
- SO YOU KNOW.

20:15.315 --> 20:17.417
EVERYONE KNOWS.
JUST NO ONE'S DOING NOTHING.

20:17.450 --> 20:19.719
- IN THE CAR.

20:19.752 --> 20:21.554
WE GOT OUR TWO SUSPECTS.
IT'S TIME TO CALL THE A.D.A.,

20:21.588 --> 20:23.356
GET SAM OUT.

20:23.390 --> 20:26.893
- I THINK WE SHOULD GET
THE FATHER TO I.D. THEM FIRST.

20:31.898 --> 20:32.965
- NO, NO,
NOT THIS TIME.

20:32.999 --> 20:35.468
[knock at door]

20:35.502 --> 20:37.370
- IS THERE A PROBLEM, FATHER?

20:37.404 --> 20:38.871
- MONSIGNOR WAS JUST LEAVING.

20:38.905 --> 20:41.841
- YOU TOO?

20:41.874 --> 20:46.746
A TICKET TO GUATEMALA.

20:46.779 --> 20:48.881
YOU PLANNING ON LEAVING
THE COUNTRY, FATHER?

20:48.915 --> 20:51.318
- FATHER SHEA WANTS TO RETURN
TO THE ORPHANAGE.

20:51.351 --> 20:53.420
- WELL, WE'D PREFER IT IF HE
DIDN'T GO ANYWHERE JUST YET.

20:53.453 --> 20:56.055
YOU'VE HEARD THAT WE ARRESTED
ENRIQUE RODRIGUEZ?

20:56.088 --> 20:57.724
- I TOLD YOU,
I'M NOT PRESSING CHARGES.

20:57.757 --> 20:59.326
- BUT YOU'RE STILL A WITNESS.

20:59.359 --> 21:01.394
WE NEED YOU TO COME
TO THE STATION AND MAKE AN I.D.

21:01.428 --> 21:03.863
- HE WAS IN A COMA.
HE'S CONCUSSED.

21:03.896 --> 21:06.566
- WELL, NOW YOU LOOK LIKE
YOU'RE FEELING BETTER.

21:06.599 --> 21:09.602
WHY DON'T WE ASK A DOCTOR
IF YOU'RE UP TO IT?

21:12.672 --> 21:14.040
THAT ONE-WAY TICKET?

21:14.073 --> 21:15.875
TURNS OUT IT WAS PAID FOR
BY THE ARCHDIOCESE.

21:15.908 --> 21:18.778
- SO MENENDEZ WANTED SHEA GONE
JUST LIKE HE DID TEN YEARS AGO.

21:18.811 --> 21:20.413
- WE GOT ADAM BENITEZ'S
STATEMENT.

21:20.447 --> 21:22.582
SHOULD BE ENOUGH
FOR THE A.D.A.

21:22.615 --> 21:24.884
- THAT GUY IS COVERING HIS ASS
SIX WAYS TO SUNDAY.

21:24.917 --> 21:28.588
WE SHOULD GET ENRIQUE'S
STATEMENT TOO, ON VIDEO.

21:28.621 --> 21:30.923
I DON'T WANT THAT A.D.A.
QUESTIONING IT LATER.

21:30.957 --> 21:32.925
- YOU WANT TO KNOW
WHAT I DID?

21:32.959 --> 21:35.795
I WANT TO TELL YOU WHAT
THIS SON OF A BITCH SHEA DID.

21:35.828 --> 21:36.963
- SO TELL US.
WE'LL INVESTIGATE.

21:36.996 --> 21:40.900
- [chuckles]
- HEY, I GIVE YOU MY WORD.

21:42.602 --> 21:44.371
- WHEN DID THE ABUSE START?

21:44.404 --> 21:46.806
- ANGELICA WAS 12.

21:46.839 --> 21:49.476
I WAS 16.

21:49.509 --> 21:51.378
PUBLIC SCHOOLS WERE BAD,

21:51.411 --> 21:53.680
AND MOM THOUGHT WE'D BE SAFE
AT CATHOLIC SCHOOL.

21:53.713 --> 21:55.014
- AT ST. HORATIO'S?

21:55.047 --> 21:57.550
AND YOUR DAD,
HE WAS OUT OF THE PICTURE?

21:57.584 --> 21:58.985
- MY DAD LEFT
WHEN WE WERE IN GRADE SCHOOL.

21:59.018 --> 22:01.354
- AND THAT YEAR, YOU NOTICED
SOMETHING WAS GOING ON

22:01.388 --> 22:04.391
WITH ANGELICA?

22:04.424 --> 22:06.092
- YEAH.

22:06.125 --> 22:08.361
SHE STARTED DRINKING.

22:08.395 --> 22:10.697
SMOKING POT.

22:10.730 --> 22:12.499
MY MOTHER SAID
SHE WAS A SINNER.

22:12.532 --> 22:15.368
- YOU KNEW THAT FATHER SHEA
WAS BEING...

22:15.402 --> 22:16.836
INAPPROPRIATE WITH HER?

22:16.869 --> 22:20.407
- IF I'D HAVE KNOWN,
I'D HAVE KILLED HIM.

22:20.440 --> 22:23.843
- OKAY.
SO WHEN DID YOU FIND OUT?

22:23.876 --> 22:26.546
- ANGELICA...

22:26.579 --> 22:29.682
ALWAYS GETS CRAZY
AT THE HOLIDAYS.

22:29.716 --> 22:32.118
THIS THANKSGIVING, SHE--

22:32.151 --> 22:33.820
SHE'S SUPPOSED
TO BE SOBER,

22:33.853 --> 22:36.155
BUT SHE CAME IN STONED.

22:36.188 --> 22:40.092
AND I JUST WENT OFF.

22:40.126 --> 22:43.463
AND THEN SHE STARTED CRYING
AND SAID

22:43.496 --> 22:46.499
THAT I'D NEVER BEEN THERE
FOR HER.

22:49.068 --> 22:52.572
NOT EVEN THE CHRISTMAS...

22:52.605 --> 22:55.842
WHEN SHE WAS 13...

22:55.875 --> 22:58.945
AND PREGNANT.

22:58.978 --> 23:02.081
AND HE MADE HER HAVE
AN ABORTION.

23:08.921 --> 23:12.158
I NEVER KNEW.

23:12.191 --> 23:15.995
I THOUGHT SHE WAS
IN THE DAMN CHURCH.

23:16.028 --> 23:18.831
ALL THAT TIME
WITH FATHER SHEA,

23:18.865 --> 23:22.935
I THOUGHT HE WAS
COUNSELING HER.

23:22.969 --> 23:27.039
- GO ON.

23:27.073 --> 23:30.743
- THE SICK BASTARD
SAID IT HAPPENED

23:30.777 --> 23:35.014
BECAUSE SHE WAS EVIL.

23:35.047 --> 23:38.050
THAT SHE SEDUCED HIM.

23:40.820 --> 23:43.990
FATHER SHEA.

23:44.023 --> 23:48.127
HE--

23:48.160 --> 23:53.065
HE SAID HE WAS GONNA MAKE HER
DO IT...

23:53.099 --> 23:57.970
UNTIL SHE DIDN'T WANT IT
AGAIN...

23:58.004 --> 24:01.007
TO EXORCISE THE DEMON
OF SEX IN HER.

24:04.210 --> 24:07.547
- SO WHEN YOU SAW
FATHER SHEA

24:07.580 --> 24:09.516
IN THE CAR
WITH THAT LITTLE GIRL--

24:09.549 --> 24:11.651
- I DID WHAT I SHOULD'VE DONE
TEN YEARS AGO.

24:11.684 --> 24:14.854
- OKAY, ENRIQUE,
SO IF YOUR SISTER

24:14.887 --> 24:18.725
WILL CORROBORATE THE STORY
AND I.D. FATHER SHEA,

24:18.758 --> 24:20.660
IT MIGHT HELP A JURY
TO UNDERSTAND--

24:20.693 --> 24:22.161
- NO.

24:22.194 --> 24:24.130
NO, I DON'T--I DON'T WANT
TO PUT HER THROUGH THAT.

24:24.163 --> 24:28.868
ANGELICA'S IN REHAB.
SHE'S A MESS.

24:28.901 --> 24:33.005
FATHER SHEA, HE'S COMING IN
TO I.D. ME, RIGHT?

24:33.039 --> 24:37.143
ASK HIM.

24:37.176 --> 24:39.779
- YOU'VE GOT FATHER SHEA
ABSOLVING SAM,

24:39.812 --> 24:41.748
ENRIQUE AND ADAM
CONFESSING TO THE BEAT-DOWN.

24:41.781 --> 24:43.182
I DON'T SEE THE PROBLEM.

24:43.215 --> 24:44.617
- BECAUSE IT'S NOT YOUR PROBLEM.
IT'S MINE.

24:44.651 --> 24:45.852
YOU WANT ME TO DROP CHARGES

24:45.885 --> 24:47.086
AGAINST YOUR PARTNER'S
BROTHER-IN-LAW.

24:47.119 --> 24:48.555
- EX-BROTHER-IN-LAW.

24:48.588 --> 24:50.857
- REALLY?
YOU ARE A MASOCHIST.

24:50.890 --> 24:53.593
EX OR NOT,
THERE'S PROTOCOL HERE.

24:53.626 --> 24:54.927
THIS ISN'T YOUR CASE.

24:54.961 --> 24:55.995
MAYBE THERE'S
NO PROBABLE CAUSE

24:56.028 --> 24:57.897
FOR THE ATTACK
ON THE PRIEST,

24:57.930 --> 25:00.266
BUT YOU'VE STILL GOT A PAROLEE
WHO WENT VIGILANTE.

25:00.299 --> 25:02.902
ASSAULTING ANYONE
VIOLATES HIS PAROLE.

25:02.935 --> 25:04.937
- YEAH, WE KNOW.
- LOOK.

25:04.971 --> 25:07.206
IF YOU WANT HIM RELEASED,
I'M GOING TO NEED FATHER SHEA

25:07.239 --> 25:10.042
TO I.D. HIS ATTACKERS,
JUST FOR BELTS AND SUSPENDERS.

25:10.076 --> 25:11.944
- WE'RE PULLING A LINEUP NOW.

25:11.978 --> 25:15.314
- I ASSUMED.
GET THAT. WE'LL TALK.

25:15.347 --> 25:17.950
- WELL, TAKE YOUR TIME,
FATHER.

25:17.984 --> 25:21.220
DO YOU RECOGNIZE
ANY OF THEM?

25:21.253 --> 25:22.889
- I DON'T WANT TO SEND ANYONE
TO PRISON.

25:22.922 --> 25:24.156
- WELL, THE D.A. HAS TO PUT
SOMEONE AWAY.

25:24.190 --> 25:25.825
IF IT ISN'T THE MEN
WHO ATTACKED YOU,

25:25.858 --> 25:27.093
IT'LL BE SAM RANDALL.

25:27.126 --> 25:28.861
- I MADE A STATEMENT
ABSOLVING HIM.

25:28.895 --> 25:30.262
- YEAH, THE D.A.'S
NOT BUYING IT.

25:30.296 --> 25:33.566
HE NEEDS YOU TO I.D. THE MEN
WHO DID BEAT YOU.

25:33.600 --> 25:37.637
- SO I HAVE NO CHOICE.

25:37.670 --> 25:39.639
- YEAH, NOT UNLESS YOU WANT
TO KEEP YOUR SAVIOR

25:39.672 --> 25:44.844
IN JAIL, FATHER.

25:44.877 --> 25:46.813
- NUMBER THREE, ENRIQUE.

25:46.846 --> 25:49.949
- YOU CAN GO IN
TO SEE YOUR CLIENT.

25:49.982 --> 25:51.851
- SO YOU DID KNOW
YOUR ATTACKER.

25:51.884 --> 25:53.886
- ENRIQUE RODRIGUEZ.

25:53.920 --> 25:56.756
HE WAS A PARISHIONER
OF MINE.

25:56.789 --> 25:58.825
SO WE'RE--WE'RE DONE HERE?
I I.D.ed HIM.

25:58.858 --> 26:00.593
JUST SO YOU KNOW,

26:00.627 --> 26:01.928
I'M NOT GOING TO TESTIFY
AGAINST HIM IN COURT.

26:01.961 --> 26:04.096
SENDING HIM TO JAIL,
THAT IS NOT RIGHT.

26:04.130 --> 26:06.132
- AND WHY IS THAT, FATHER?

26:06.165 --> 26:10.302
BECAUSE YOU GAVE HIM
GOOD REASON TO ATTACK YOU?

26:10.336 --> 26:14.907
- HE DESERVES FORGIVENESS.

26:14.941 --> 26:16.909
AS WE ALL DO.
WE ALL MAKE MISTAKES.

26:16.943 --> 26:18.811
- MISTAKES.

26:18.845 --> 26:21.180
IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE CALLING
WHAT YOU DID TO ANGELICA?

26:21.213 --> 26:22.649
A MISTAKE?

26:22.682 --> 26:24.851
- WHAT?

26:24.884 --> 26:26.318
NO. NO.
YOU HAVE IT WRONG.

26:26.352 --> 26:29.656
- YEAH, DO WE?

26:29.689 --> 26:33.793
THAT'S NOT WHAT ENRIQUE
TOLD US.

26:33.826 --> 26:35.928
- HE SAID IT HAPPENED

26:35.962 --> 26:39.899
BECAUSE SHE WAS EVIL.

26:39.932 --> 26:42.669
THAT SHE SEDUCED HIM.

26:42.702 --> 26:45.171
FATHER SHEA,

26:45.204 --> 26:48.775
HE SAID THAT HE WAS GOING
TO KEEP DOING IT TO HER

26:48.808 --> 26:51.077
UNTIL SHE DIDN'T WANT IT
ANYMORE,

26:51.110 --> 26:55.915
TO EXORCISE THE DEMON OF SEX
IN HER.

26:55.948 --> 26:58.150
- IS THAT WHY YOU DON'T WANT
TO PRESS CHARGES?

26:58.184 --> 26:59.786
YOU'RE AFRAID THIS
WILL COME OUT IN COURT?

26:59.819 --> 27:00.987
- NO.
- THAT YOU RAPE YOUNG GIRLS.

27:01.020 --> 27:02.388
- NO.
- ANGELICA TEN YEARS AGO,

27:02.421 --> 27:04.957
AND WHO KNOWS HOW MANY SINCE--
SOFIA?

27:04.991 --> 27:07.193
- NO! GOD, NO.
- NO?

27:07.226 --> 27:09.061
SO TELL US.

27:09.095 --> 27:11.931
TELL US, WHAT WERE YOU DOING
IN THE CAR WITH SOFIA?

27:11.964 --> 27:16.903
- I--

27:16.936 --> 27:18.905
- WE'RE GONNA BRING HER IN.
- NO.

27:18.938 --> 27:21.340
NO, YOU CAN'T.

27:21.373 --> 27:23.242
[breathing shakily]
PLEASE.

27:23.275 --> 27:25.878
[sobbing]
GOD FORGIVE ME.

27:25.912 --> 27:29.181
GOD FORGIVE ME.

27:38.124 --> 27:39.992
- ANGELICA RODRIGUEZ?

27:40.026 --> 27:41.828
- I'M CLEAN.
DOING MY REHAB.

27:41.861 --> 27:44.697
- WE'RE NOT WITH NARCOTICS.
WE'RE SPECIAL VICTIMS.

27:44.731 --> 27:47.734
- I'M NOT SPECIAL,
AND EVERYONE'S A VICTIM.

27:47.767 --> 27:50.169
- OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOUR BROTHER, ENRIQUE,

27:50.202 --> 27:51.738
HE NEEDS YOUR HELP.

27:51.771 --> 27:54.707
- ENRIQUE?
WHAT HAPPENED?

27:54.741 --> 27:58.277
- HE WAS ARRESTED
FOR ASSAULTING A PRIEST.

27:58.310 --> 28:00.212
- [whispers]
OH, GOD.

28:00.246 --> 28:03.415
I NEVER SHOULD'VE TOLD HIM.

28:03.449 --> 28:05.417
- TOLD HIM WHAT, ANGELICA?

28:05.451 --> 28:07.353
- YOU KNOW,
WHERE THE GOOD FATHER PUT

28:07.386 --> 28:11.924
HIS LITTLE BISHOP.

28:11.958 --> 28:13.826
IS ENRIQUE GOING TO JAIL?

28:13.860 --> 28:15.728
- YEAH, THERE'S A GOOD CHANCE
OF THAT.

28:15.762 --> 28:18.197
- IT'D BE EASIER
IF HE NEVER KNEW.

28:18.230 --> 28:21.167
I'M A DEAD GIRL WALKING,
BUT HE COULD STILL HAVE A LIFE.

28:21.200 --> 28:22.935
- YOU COULD HELP HIM

28:22.969 --> 28:24.470
IF YOU TESTIFY
THAT YOU WERE MOLESTED

28:24.503 --> 28:27.774
AND I.D. YOUR ABUSER.

28:37.316 --> 28:38.450
- WHERE'S ENRIQUE?
CAN I SEE HIM?

28:38.484 --> 28:41.053
- AFTER THE LINEUP, OKAY?

28:41.087 --> 28:44.090
SURE YOU'RE OKAY
TO DO THIS?

28:51.563 --> 28:56.435
- NUMBER FOUR IS FATHER SHEA.

28:56.468 --> 28:58.004
- OKAY.

28:58.037 --> 28:59.939
SO HE'S THE MAN
WHO ABUSED YOU.

28:59.972 --> 29:01.808
- WHAT? NO.

29:01.841 --> 29:04.010
- ANGELICA, WE KNOW
HOW DIFFICULT THIS IS.

29:04.043 --> 29:06.112
BUT HE CAN'T HURT YOU.
HE'S IN CUSTODY NOW.

29:06.145 --> 29:07.513
- NO, THAT'S FATHER SHEA.

29:07.546 --> 29:08.848
YOU DON'T GET IT.
IT WASN'T HIM.

29:08.881 --> 29:10.116
- NO, NO, OKAY, ANGELI--

29:10.149 --> 29:13.152
- DON'T TOUCH ME!

29:15.888 --> 29:19.325
- YOU WANT TO TELL ME
WHAT'S GOING ON, FATHER?

29:19.358 --> 29:22.261
- IF ANGELICA WON'T SAY,
IT'S NOT MY PLACE.

29:22.294 --> 29:24.496
SHE GAVE ME HER CONFESSION.

29:24.530 --> 29:27.800
- DOESN'T GIVE YOU AN EXCUSE
TO COVER UP A CRIME.

29:31.270 --> 29:34.974
SO WHY WERE YOU TRANSFERRED
OUT OF ST. HORATIO'S?

29:35.007 --> 29:36.575
- BECAUSE I SINNED.

29:36.608 --> 29:38.077
I BROKE MY VOWS.

29:38.110 --> 29:40.479
- THAT'S NOT GOOD ENOUGH,
FATHER.

29:40.512 --> 29:43.149
- [sighs]

29:43.182 --> 29:46.352
IT'S NOT MY STORY TO TELL.

29:46.385 --> 29:50.322
- THE PRIEST TAUGHT US
ABORTION WAS A SIN.

29:50.356 --> 29:52.859
THEN HE MADE ME MURDER
MY BABY.

29:52.892 --> 29:56.295
- WHO DID?

29:56.328 --> 29:58.364
- IT WASN'T FATHER SHEA.

29:58.397 --> 30:01.533
HE TRIED TO HELP ME.

30:05.304 --> 30:07.406
I WAS BLEEDING

30:07.439 --> 30:11.543
AFTER THE BABY WAS GONE.

30:11.577 --> 30:15.414
FATHER SHEA FOUND ME.

30:15.447 --> 30:18.484
I CONFESSED THE THINGS
I HAD DONE

30:18.517 --> 30:22.454
AND WHO I HAD DONE THEM WITH.

30:22.488 --> 30:24.256
IT DIDN'T HAPPEN AGAIN.

30:24.290 --> 30:26.625
- THAT'S WHY FATHER SHEA
WAS SENT AWAY.

30:26.658 --> 30:29.929
- SO WHO DID ABUSE YOU,
ANGELICA?

30:29.962 --> 30:32.331
YOU'RE 22.

30:32.364 --> 30:35.367
WE CAN STILL PUT HIM AWAY.

30:37.937 --> 30:40.406
- I DON'T KNOW
IF I CAN DO THIS.

30:40.439 --> 30:42.341
- IT COULD HELP YOUR BROTHER
DO LESS TIME.

30:42.374 --> 30:44.110
- AND WE WILL BE WITH YOU

30:44.143 --> 30:47.146
EVERY STEP OF THE WAY.

30:54.253 --> 30:57.156
- THE MEN WHO BEAT YOU UP
WERE WRONG.

30:57.189 --> 30:59.325
AND WE WERE WRONG.

30:59.358 --> 31:00.559
YOU DIDN'T MOLEST ANGELICA.

31:00.592 --> 31:02.161
YOU DIDN'T MOLEST SOFIA.

31:02.194 --> 31:04.363
- NO, I WOULD NEVER--

31:04.396 --> 31:07.633
- BUT YOU KNOW WHO DID
ABUSE ANGELICA.

31:09.635 --> 31:11.603
- I'M BOUND BY THE SEAL
OF THE CONFESSIONAL.

31:11.637 --> 31:13.105
- I DON'T GET THAT, FATHER.

31:13.139 --> 31:15.041
LOOK, YOU'RE A GOOD MAN,
AND I KNOW YOU HAVE

31:15.074 --> 31:17.043
A DUTY TO THE CHURCH,
BUT YOU STILL HAVE A DUTY

31:17.076 --> 31:18.644
TO GET JUSTICE
FOR ANGELICA.

31:18.677 --> 31:20.279
- I MADE SURE
SHE WAS PROTECTED.

31:20.312 --> 31:22.915
- IS THAT WHY
YOU WERE SENT AWAY?

31:22.949 --> 31:24.550
LOOK, WHOEVER DID THIS,
HOW DO YOU KNOW

31:24.583 --> 31:27.519
HE'S NOT STILL MOLESTING
LITTLE GIRLS?

31:27.553 --> 31:29.621
- BECAUSE HE SWORE TO ME
HE WOULDN'T.

31:29.655 --> 31:31.257
- WELL, HE BROKE THE LAW,
AND IF YOU DON'T TELL ME

31:31.290 --> 31:33.159
HIS NAME,
YOU'RE BREAKING IT TOO.

31:33.192 --> 31:35.394
- I CAN'T.
I GAVE THEM MY WORD.

31:35.427 --> 31:38.330
- ARE YOU PROTECTING
A PEDOPHILE OR THE CHURCH?

31:38.364 --> 31:41.600
- NO! NEITHER.
- THEN WHAT IS IT, HMM?

31:41.633 --> 31:43.135
DID HE HAVE LEVERAGE ON YOU?

31:43.169 --> 31:45.304
I MEAN,
ARE YOU PROTECTING YOURSELF?

31:45.337 --> 31:47.106
- NO, THIS HAS NOTHING
TO DO WITH ME.

31:47.139 --> 31:48.440
I DON'T MATTER
IN ANY OF THIS.

31:48.474 --> 31:50.542
- ALL RIGHT, THEN,
WHO DOES?

31:50.576 --> 31:53.479
WHO ELSE MATTERS
THAT MUCH TO YOU--

31:58.484 --> 32:01.487
OH.

32:07.593 --> 32:10.396
I'M SORRY, FATHER.

32:16.735 --> 32:22.341
[cell door opens and closes]

32:22.374 --> 32:24.610
HEY, YOU WERE RIGHT.
HE'S HIDING SOMETHING.

32:24.643 --> 32:26.245
- BUT HE'S NOT GUILTY
OF ABUSE.

32:26.278 --> 32:29.348
- NO. WE GOT THE WRONG SIN.

32:32.351 --> 32:35.487
[knock at door]

32:35.521 --> 32:38.590
- OH, DETECTIVES.
CAN I HELP YOU?

32:38.624 --> 32:40.659
- ACTUALLY, IT'S FATHER SHEA
WHO NEEDS YOUR HELP.

32:40.692 --> 32:42.528
- IS HE ALL RIGHT?

32:42.561 --> 32:45.564
- HONEY, CAN YOU WAIT OUTSIDE?

32:49.268 --> 32:52.238
- THOSE ACCUSATIONS
WE TOLD YOU ABOUT--

32:52.271 --> 32:54.073
- I SAID HE WOULD NEVER--

32:54.106 --> 32:57.676
- WELL, HE CAN'T
OR WON'T DEFEND HIMSELF.

32:57.709 --> 32:59.445
THINKS IF HE TELLS US
THE TRUTH,

32:59.478 --> 33:02.014
SOMEONE INNOCENT
WILL GET HURT.

33:02.048 --> 33:03.782
- I-I DON'T KNOW WHO.

33:03.815 --> 33:07.186
- YOU KNOW,
I HAVE A DAUGHTER.

33:07.219 --> 33:10.489
MOST DAYS, I THINK SHE LOOKS
JUST LIKE HER MOTHER.

33:10.522 --> 33:13.192
BEAUTIFUL.

33:13.225 --> 33:15.461
BUT SOMETIMES,

33:15.494 --> 33:17.563
WHEN MY DAUGHTER'S
MOOD CHANGES...

33:21.533 --> 33:25.237
I SEE MYSELF.

33:25.271 --> 33:27.773
- PLEASE.

33:27.806 --> 33:29.808
DON'T.

33:29.841 --> 33:33.045
- DOES SOFIA KNOW
WHO HER FATHER IS?

33:43.189 --> 33:44.790
- WE SPOKE TO MS. SANTIAGO.

33:44.823 --> 33:48.494
AND SHE TOLD US
THAT SOFIA IS YOUR DAUGHTER.

33:51.330 --> 33:54.266
- I SPENT TEN YEARS MAKING SURE
THAT WAS KEPT SECRET

33:54.300 --> 33:55.601
FOR SOFIA'S SAKE.

33:55.634 --> 33:58.104
- BUT MENENDEZ KNEW.

33:58.137 --> 33:59.805
- RITA CONFESSED TO HIM.

33:59.838 --> 34:02.608
SHE TOLD HIM
HOW MUCH IN LOVE WE WERE.

34:02.641 --> 34:04.776
- AND HE USED THAT
AS LEVERAGE

34:04.810 --> 34:07.146
TO KEEP YOU QUIET ABOUT WHAT
HE DID TO ANGELICA.

34:07.179 --> 34:09.648
- NO, THAT WASN'T THE REASON.

34:09.681 --> 34:11.150
- WELL?

34:11.183 --> 34:13.819
- AFTER ANGELICA
CAME TO ME,

34:13.852 --> 34:16.155
I WENT TO MENENDEZ.

34:16.188 --> 34:19.358
HE ASKED ME
TO HEAR HIS CONFESSION.

34:19.391 --> 34:22.761
HE TOLD ME
WHAT HE DID TO HER.

34:25.497 --> 34:27.733
HE SAID IT WAS
A ONE-TIME WEAKNESS.

34:30.736 --> 34:32.804
- AND ONCE HE CONFESSED,

34:32.838 --> 34:34.406
YOU WERE BOUND BY THE VOW
OF THE CONFESSIONAL.

34:34.440 --> 34:38.144
- SEE, THAT'S STILL NOT
GOOD ENOUGH, FATHER.

34:38.177 --> 34:40.546
YOU PUT OTHER GIRLS
IN JEOPARDY.

34:40.579 --> 34:42.181
- NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.
NO, NO, NO.

34:42.214 --> 34:44.350
HE SWORE TO ME
THAT IT WOULDN'T HAPPEN AGAIN.

34:44.383 --> 34:46.218
- AND YOU BELIEVED HIM?

34:46.252 --> 34:50.122
PEDOPHILES ARE GIFTED LIARS.

34:50.156 --> 34:51.490
- YES, I DID.

34:51.523 --> 34:54.626
SEE, I'VE LEFT MY DAUGHTER
AT THAT PARISH,

34:54.660 --> 34:56.695
AND RITA KEEPS
AN EYE ON HIM,

34:56.728 --> 34:58.530
AND THEN, ONCE A YEAR,
I COME IN

34:58.564 --> 35:00.399
TO TAKE HIS CONFESSION.

35:00.432 --> 35:02.468
FOR A DECADE.

35:02.501 --> 35:04.803
AND I DON'T BELIEVE
HE'S HURT ANYONE ELSE.

35:04.836 --> 35:07.239
- IS THAT HOW
YOU SLEEP AT NIGHT?

35:07.273 --> 35:12.178
- [scoffs]

35:12.211 --> 35:14.180
WHO SAYS I DO?

35:14.213 --> 35:17.583
- WELL, YOU MAY HAVE KEPT
THE VOW OF THE CONFESSIONAL,

35:17.616 --> 35:19.585
BUT YOU BROKE THE LAW.

35:19.618 --> 35:22.388
YOU HAVE A LEGAL OBLIGATION
TO REPORT ABUSE.

35:22.421 --> 35:24.156
YOU'RE AS GUILTY AS HE IS.

35:24.190 --> 35:27.159
- YES.

35:27.193 --> 35:28.294
I UNDERSTAND.

35:28.327 --> 35:29.795
- DO YOU UNDERSTAND

35:29.828 --> 35:32.464
THAT YOU HAVE TO TESTIFY
AGAINST MENENDEZ?

35:32.498 --> 35:35.501
- YES, I UNDERSTAND
THAT TOO.

35:39.805 --> 35:43.275
- YOU KNOW,
ONE MORE THING, FATHER.

35:43.309 --> 35:47.446
YOUR TRANSGRESSION
WILL COME OUT.

35:47.479 --> 35:50.482
YOU MIGHT WANT TO TELL
SOFIA YOURSELF.

35:54.220 --> 35:56.455
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
IT WASN'T HIM?

35:56.488 --> 35:59.191
THEY TRANSFERRED FATHER SHEA.

35:59.225 --> 36:01.960
THAT'S WHAT THEY DO
TO PEDOPHILES.

36:01.993 --> 36:05.397
- IT WASN'T FATHER SHEA.

36:05.431 --> 36:06.632
- BUT YOU TOLD ME
THAT THERE WAS--

36:06.665 --> 36:08.667
- I TOLD YOU
WHAT HAPPENED TO ME.

36:08.700 --> 36:11.903
I NEVER SAID WHO IT WAS.

36:11.937 --> 36:14.973
I WAS AFRAID YOU'D GO AFTER HIM,
GET IN TROUBLE.

36:15.006 --> 36:17.643
- I BEAT HIM UP.

36:17.676 --> 36:19.345
I'M IN JAIL.

36:19.378 --> 36:21.847
- HE GOT THE WRONG PRIEST.
YOU SHOULD LET HIM GO.

36:21.880 --> 36:24.883
- THAT'S NOT THE WAY
IT WORKS.

36:28.687 --> 36:30.856
- I'M SORRY, ENRIQUE.

36:30.889 --> 36:34.293
[crying]
I'M SO SORRY.

36:34.326 --> 36:36.695
- YOU DIDN'T DO
ANYTHING WRONG.

36:36.728 --> 36:38.297
IF I'D HAVE LOOKED OUT FOR YOU
IN THE FIRST PLACE,

36:38.330 --> 36:39.465
THIS WOULD'VE NEVER
HAVE HAPPENED.

36:39.498 --> 36:41.500
- [sniffles]

36:46.572 --> 36:48.307
- YEAH, I KNOW
IT'S CHRISTMAS EVE, TERESA.

I'M TRYING.

36:49.541 --> 36:51.243

[sighs]

36:51.277 --> 36:52.811
- SHE HUNG UP ON YOU?

36:52.844 --> 36:54.480
- OLD HABITS DIE HARD.

36:54.513 --> 36:56.315
- YOU'RE DOING
EVERYTHING YOU CAN.

36:56.348 --> 36:57.883
- SHE DOESN'T SEEM
TO THINK SO.

36:57.916 --> 36:59.918
BUT I GOT AN IDEA.

I NEED YOU TO SIGN A CONDITIONAL
RELEASE FOR SAM RANDALL.

37:16.335 --> 37:18.537

- COME ON, JUDGE.
IT'S CHRISTMAS EVE.

37:20.071 --> 37:21.907
YOU KNOW THE GUY
IS INNOCENT.

37:21.940 --> 37:24.410
LET HIM GO HOME
AND SPEND IT WITH HIS SON.

I'LL KEEP HIM HANDCUFFED

ANYWHERE

YOUR FAMILY'S
IN GEORGIA, RIGHT?
