00:50.000 --> 00:52.367
Would you still love me
if I couldn't pay for dinner?

00:53.560 --> 00:54.971
Possibly.

00:55.120 --> 00:57.248
[music playing]

00:57.440 --> 00:58.601
[laughs]

00:59.760 --> 01:01.091
Yeah.

01:02.240 --> 01:04.163
What do we do?

01:04.319 --> 01:06.368
I'm thinking.

01:06.520 --> 01:09.364
[laughs] We could have a big row.

01:09.520 --> 01:13.320
And... and throw some shit.
They might kick us out.

01:13.480 --> 01:16.324
Been done, and it would
draw too much attention.

01:18.240 --> 01:19.241
What are you doing?

01:19.400 --> 01:21.482
- Taking my shoes off.
- Mmm.

01:21.680 --> 01:24.160
[laughs] I'm going to leave first,

01:24.320 --> 01:28.803
and then when the time is right,
like when the maÃ®tre d's not looking,

01:28.960 --> 01:31.691
you meet me down the street.

01:34.840 --> 01:36.080
[quiet laugh]

01:42.320 --> 01:43.765
[laughs]

01:50.360 --> 01:51.771
[chuckles softly]

02:01.600 --> 02:02.726
[quietly clears throat]

02:02.880 --> 02:04.769
Uh, excuse me, sir?

02:12.080 --> 02:14.321
Hey, run! Run, run, run!

02:14.480 --> 02:16.448
[shrieks] Fucker!

02:25.400 --> 02:27.368
[laughing]

02:41.200 --> 02:43.771
- [Conor panting]
- Baby!

02:43.920 --> 02:46.082
- Are you OK?
- Oh, I'm dying.

02:46.400 --> 02:47.686
[groans]

02:47.880 --> 02:50.929
[both laughing]

02:52.040 --> 02:54.088
That was so epic!

02:54.840 --> 02:57.161
[both laughing]

02:58.120 --> 03:00.282
Well, did we lose him?

03:00.440 --> 03:02.363
I don't know.

03:02.520 --> 03:06.525
Really, did they even chase us?

03:06.760 --> 03:08.489
[laughs]

03:09.480 --> 03:11.244
[laughs]

03:29.120 --> 03:30.884
- Hey.
- [Whispers] What?

03:31.040 --> 03:33.805
Hey, hey, hey, look, look, look.
Look at them.

03:37.360 --> 03:39.362
[Conor] This is pretty good, isn't it?

03:39.520 --> 03:41.682
Yeah, it is.

03:47.560 --> 03:48.800
<i>Hey-</i>

03:48.960 --> 03:50.564
What?

03:52.560 --> 03:55.006
There's only one heart in this body.

03:57.440 --> 03:59.329
Have mercy on me.

04:04.200 --> 04:06.123
Shut up.

04:30.840 --> 04:36.449
[rattling, creaking]

04:50.680 --> 04:55.766
[train horn howling]

04:58.400 --> 05:03.122
[train wheels clacking over tracks]

05:25.760 --> 05:30.800
[train horn blasts]

05:48.560 --> 05:50.927
[chain-link fence rattling]

05:51.120 --> 05:52.121
Hey!

06:10.920 --> 06:15.209
[indistinct radio chatter]

06:33.360 --> 06:37.046
[monitor beeping]

06:48.520 --> 06:50.602

over P. A. system]

06:52.240 --> 06:53.287
[knocks on door]

06:53.440 --> 06:56.728
Mrs. Ludlow? You ready?

06:56.880 --> 06:58.928
Yep.

07:14.360 --> 07:16.362
- Hey.
- Hi.

07:18.320 --> 07:19.526
Can I... Is it gonna hurt?

07:19.680 --> 07:21.330
No, it's fine.

07:26.120 --> 07:27.610
- Is this all your stuff?
- Mmm-hmm.

07:28.200 --> 07:29.247
Uh.

07:29.400 --> 07:30.765
You sure?

07:32.400 --> 07:34.160
- Nice meeting you.
- Yeah. Have a great day.

07:42.040 --> 07:44.247
[speaking French]

08:08.400 --> 08:09.686
Where's Philip?

08:11.880 --> 08:14.486
He's asleep. He's exhausted.

08:15.880 --> 08:16.881
What should I do?

08:17.040 --> 08:19.168
Just put it somewhere.

08:33.960 --> 08:36.327
[Mary] I closed your wireless account.

08:36.480 --> 08:37.481
Thanks.

08:37.640 --> 08:40.530
What do you want to do about
all your stuff in the city?

08:42.760 --> 08:45.650
You've got some clothes
here in the closet

08:45.800 --> 08:48.200
and I have some more stuff for you
in the attic, if you want.

08:48.240 --> 08:51.687
- I'm sure that'll do fine.
- [indistinct chatter]

08:54.080 --> 08:55.127
[knocks]

08:55.280 --> 08:56.281
[chuckles]

08:56.440 --> 08:57.885
It's just like old times.

08:59.200 --> 09:00.645
Hey, Daddy.

09:12.880 --> 09:14.928
[Julian] So, what happens now?

09:15.080 --> 09:17.924
I'm guessing you give
a speech of some sort.

09:18.080 --> 09:20.560
What do you want to do, El?

09:20.720 --> 09:22.848
Something else.

09:23.880 --> 09:24.961
I'm open to ideas.

09:25.120 --> 09:26.724
You could take some classes.

09:29.160 --> 09:30.730
Could we talk about it later?

09:30.920 --> 09:32.968
What about Conor?

09:40.040 --> 09:41.166
[laughing] Hey..-

09:41.320 --> 09:43.402
- Auntie Em!
- Hi. [laughs]

09:44.880 --> 09:46.370
Missed you.

09:46.560 --> 09:48.164
I missed you.

09:48.320 --> 09:50.527
What'd you guys do today, huh?

09:50.680 --> 09:52.648
- Chasing butterflies.
- Mmm.

09:53.160 --> 09:55.083
- I catched one.
- You did?

09:55.280 --> 09:58.363
Let's give her some time
to get settled in, OK, babe?

09:58.520 --> 10:00.841
- Bye, honey.
- Bye.

10:07.240 --> 10:09.368
Do you need anything?

10:09.520 --> 10:11.409
Nope. Thank you.

10:11.560 --> 10:15.121
I'm going into town in a bit
if you want to join, get out?

10:15.280 --> 10:18.284
Yeah. You yell up at me
when you're going?

10:33.560 --> 10:35.642
That's brutal, man.

10:36.880 --> 10:38.370
Maybe she wants you to go after her.

10:38.520 --> 10:40.249
No. She doesn't.

10:40.760 --> 10:42.364
Maybe wait a couple of days,
then go after her?

10:42.520 --> 10:44.807
Stu, don't.

10:45.840 --> 10:47.365
Well, I guess...

10:47.520 --> 10:51.002
- if someone flirts with extinction...
- Shut the fuck up.

10:51.160 --> 10:53.481
OK, I'm sorry, I don't know what to say.
What am I supposed to say?

10:53.640 --> 10:56.211
You don't have to say anything.
Just shut up,

10:56.360 --> 10:58.727
drink and... talk about the weather.

10:58.880 --> 11:02.168
Hey, the dude at table two says he's
gonna kick your ass if he doesn't

11:02.320 --> 11:05.051
- get his chicken satay soon.
- Well, he can suck my balls.

11:05.200 --> 11:06.850
Well, maybe you should
tell him that yourself.

11:07.000 --> 11:08.570
- Table two?
- Mmm-hmm.

11:08.720 --> 11:10.370
I'll deal with it.

11:10.560 --> 11:12.050
Hey, we're out of beer.

11:12.200 --> 11:14.407
What? How can we be out of beer?
We got two boxes back there.

11:14.560 --> 11:16.244
- Go and check...
- Sorry.

11:17.120 --> 11:19.282
You don't throw shit in my place, man.
What's your problem?

11:19.440 --> 11:21.807
- Where's our fucking food, man?
- Listen, don't threaten my chef.

11:21.960 --> 11:23.883
- OK, calm down.
- Don't tell me to fucking calm down.

11:24.040 --> 11:25.690
Hey! If you threaten my chef again,

11:25.840 --> 11:27.604
I will dropkick you
out of the fucking door.

11:27.760 --> 11:29.520
- Are you fucking kidding me?
- Hey, come on!

11:30.040 --> 11:31.644
[indistinct shouting]

11:31.840 --> 11:32.841
Hey, Stu!

11:34.320 --> 11:35.446
[Stuart] Whoa, whoa, whoa.

11:35.600 --> 11:39.366
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
You are gonna pay.

11:39.520 --> 11:41.522
- Conor, Conor, buddy, you all right?
- Get the fuck out!

11:41.720 --> 11:43.688
- Fuck you!
- Yeah, fuck you, man!

11:43.840 --> 11:47.128
Nice comeback. Very nice.
Get out of here. You, too.

11:47.280 --> 11:48.884
Get out.

11:49.040 --> 11:52.761
You forget your stupid sunglasses,
too, fuckhead?

12:10.240 --> 12:12.447
[door creaks, closes]

12:41.400 --> 12:44.280
<i>[automated voice] You</i> have <i>reached</i>
a <i>number that is no longer in service.</i>

12:44.400 --> 12:46.164
<i>- Please check the number...
- Shit.</i>

12:46.320 --> 12:48.288
<i>...and try your call again.
Thank you.</i>

13:01.400 --> 13:03.448
- [Mary] Hello?
- Mary?

13:03.600 --> 13:07.127
- Yes?
- It's Conor.

13:11.040 --> 13:13.042
Is El there?

13:13.880 --> 13:15.211
[hangs UP]

13:15.360 --> 13:16.646
Hel...

13:16.880 --> 13:18.006
Hello?

13:19.680 --> 13:21.170
Hello?

13:26.240 --> 13:27.810
[sighs]

14:04.200 --> 14:05.440
<i>Hey-</i>

14:07.080 --> 14:08.764
I thought I could, um...

14:10.200 --> 14:11.960
I thought I could stay here
for a little bit.

14:15.840 --> 14:17.763
Hi, Ralph.

14:20.680 --> 14:22.523
You know where the guest bedroom is.

14:22.680 --> 14:24.205
Yup.

14:24.360 --> 14:26.761
There's towels in a closet
in the hallway.

14:26.920 --> 14:28.809
Not much in the fridge.

14:28.960 --> 14:31.406
Got some Cheerios.

14:31.560 --> 14:36.327
That's fine with me.
I can go get some stuff. That's easy.

14:40.000 --> 14:42.082
Well, I got to get to the restaurant.

14:42.240 --> 14:43.685
- OK.
- Good night.

14:43.840 --> 14:45.444
Night.

15:11.840 --> 15:13.444
Whoa, hey. Hey, El.

15:15.920 --> 15:16.921
<i>Hey-</i>

15:17.080 --> 15:19.651
- Hey, Stu.
- Wow.

15:19.800 --> 15:21.290
How are you?

15:21.480 --> 15:23.209
You remember my dad?

15:23.400 --> 15:25.368
<i>Hey-</i>

15:25.520 --> 15:27.841
- How are you?
- Good, thanks.

15:29.080 --> 15:30.684
You're the chef.

15:30.840 --> 15:33.320
[chuckles] Yeah, I'm the chef.

15:33.480 --> 15:35.960
It's all right.

15:36.160 --> 15:37.491
How is the restaurant?

15:37.640 --> 15:38.721
Good.

15:38.880 --> 15:41.087
Yeah, it's going good.
Going really well.

15:41.240 --> 15:43.242
El, you have to register.

15:43.400 --> 15:44.401
We, we have to head off.

15:44.560 --> 15:47.291
All right, yeah, I got to get this back
to the restaurant, but it's good...

15:47.440 --> 15:49.363
- Good to see you.
- Yeah, you, too.

15:50.960 --> 15:55.284
Hey, if you ever want to get, like,
coffee or... or something,

15:55.440 --> 15:57.761
you know, shoot me a text
or call or something.

15:57.920 --> 15:59.922
- OK.
- Good seeing you.

16:08.160 --> 16:10.049
So, Lillian is expecting you.

16:10.200 --> 16:11.645
Mmm-hmm.

16:12.240 --> 16:14.208
She and I were colleagues at NYU.

16:14.360 --> 16:15.771
I know. You told me.

16:17.000 --> 16:18.331
You have...

16:20.760 --> 16:22.280
...pencils and notebooks and all that?

16:22.400 --> 16:23.811
[chuckling] Yes, Dad.

16:25.560 --> 16:27.210
I have class, and...

16:27.360 --> 16:29.408
...then I have patients.

16:29.560 --> 16:31.608
So I guess I'll...

16:32.880 --> 16:34.400
...see you at the house later tonight.

16:34.480 --> 16:35.970
OK.

16:37.880 --> 16:39.450
- El?
- Yeah?

16:40.400 --> 16:41.890
Have a good first day.

16:42.040 --> 16:43.530
I Will.

16:49.120 --> 16:50.201
[phone ringing]

16:55.000 --> 16:57.321
- How's the weather down there?
- Balmy.

16:57.480 --> 17:00.131
- Do we have an appointment?
- I'm Eleanor Rigby.

17:01.840 --> 17:03.524
That must be tough.

17:03.680 --> 17:06.490
I'm here to talk my way
into your Identity Theory class.

17:06.640 --> 17:07.971
Oh, you're Julian's kid.

17:08.119 --> 17:10.361
I need some caffeine.
You're welcome to walk with me.

17:10.520 --> 17:11.964
OK.

17:12.560 --> 17:15.006
So, was Julian into The Beatles
or something?

17:15.160 --> 17:17.925
- Sort of.
- What do you mean, "sort of"?

17:18.079 --> 17:23.883
Um, he met my mom on the street during
one of the Beatles' hoax reunions.

17:24.040 --> 17:26.849
There was a rumor they were gonna
play a show here before Lennon died.

17:27.000 --> 17:29.040
Just like the one they did
on the rooftop in London.

17:29.120 --> 17:32.442
My parents stood next to each other
waiting for the band to never show.

17:32.600 --> 17:34.602
Nostalgists.

17:34.760 --> 17:39.129
That, and my dad's surname is Rigby.

17:39.280 --> 17:42.841
- You must detest the Beatles.
- No, not really.

17:44.680 --> 17:46.842
- Do you want something?
- Uh-uh.

17:51.960 --> 17:54.486
Double espresso, three Splendas, please.

17:59.640 --> 18:01.802
So, why do you want to be in my class?

18:01.960 --> 18:04.167
Your course sounds interesting.

18:05.080 --> 18:08.527
And... look, you're a colleague
of my dad's, so...

18:08.680 --> 18:11.126
Yeah, well, you got to do
better than that.

18:11.280 --> 18:12.884
You want me to make something up?

18:13.040 --> 18:15.008
Well, most people do.

18:16.120 --> 18:18.282
You're just taking classes
just to take classes, right?

18:18.440 --> 18:20.966
- Something like that.
- Well, let me save you some time.

18:21.160 --> 18:23.401
All the perpetual students,
the hedge-fund wives,

18:23.560 --> 18:26.769
and your generation of too many choices,
they usually go to Tim Gunn's class

18:26.920 --> 18:29.048
<i>and listen to him</i> talk about
<i>Project Runway,</i>

18:29.200 --> 18:32.283
or you could take the Art History class
on the advent of color photography

18:32.440 --> 18:34.442
just for good cocktail party
conversation.

18:36.320 --> 18:38.448
My "generation of too many choices"?

18:38.600 --> 18:41.046
Democracy has its drawbacks.

18:42.240 --> 18:44.766
[woman] Here's your double espresso,
three Splendas.

18:44.920 --> 18:46.570
Thank you.

18:48.840 --> 18:52.287
You're... teaching classes
just to teach classes, right?

18:55.200 --> 18:56.725
Something like that.

19:00.400 --> 19:01.686
[groans]

19:01.840 --> 19:04.923
I'm having a month, I'm sorry.

19:06.800 --> 19:10.566
Your father didn't give me much warning
or tell me much about you.

19:10.720 --> 19:13.087
And I'm really not one for nepotism.

19:13.240 --> 19:17.643
I just got the call asking
if I could squeeze you into a class.

19:20.920 --> 19:22.809
So I don't really know who you are.

19:22.960 --> 19:24.644
It's OK.

19:26.240 --> 19:28.049
Neither do I.

20:09.080 --> 20:10.650
You want to help me?

20:10.800 --> 20:12.564
You making chemise?

20:12.960 --> 20:14.405
Mmm-hmm.

20:15.080 --> 20:18.482
With summer vegetables and...
and some basil.

20:18.640 --> 20:19.766
Mmm.

20:19.920 --> 20:22.400
You remember when you
first had them, in Luberon?

20:22.560 --> 20:24.005
- Mmm-mmm
- No?

20:24.200 --> 20:28.364
You were four, and you were so fat.

20:30.280 --> 20:32.408
My mother and I would cook
a big plate of them,

20:32.560 --> 20:35.564
and left it on the kitchen table,
and you would eat

20:35.720 --> 20:40.851
one and one and one and the other
until the plate was completely empty.

20:42.640 --> 20:44.404
You went to nursery school that fall,

20:44.560 --> 20:48.360
and all these women
gave me those weird looks and...

20:48.520 --> 20:51.410
they were wondering
what I was feeding you with.

20:51.600 --> 20:52.681
Well, I was a butterball.

20:52.840 --> 20:55.127
I felt completely stupid.

20:56.280 --> 20:59.921
Like I had no idea what I was doing,
the way those women looked at me.

21:00.080 --> 21:01.411
Did you?

21:01.560 --> 21:02.971
Did I what?

21:03.120 --> 21:05.566
Did you know what you were doing?

21:05.720 --> 21:07.722
I think I didn't realize
I wouldn't be able to retrieve

21:07.880 --> 21:10.850
all the opportunities I threw away then.

21:14.200 --> 21:17.602
You're not the only one who's
done stupid things to herself.

21:19.160 --> 21:21.322
My darling.

21:23.840 --> 21:25.285
I have no clue where she's going.

21:26.920 --> 21:29.890
She turns off her cell phone,
and like that, she's vanished.

21:30.040 --> 21:32.281
And... does that make sense to you?

21:32.440 --> 21:34.204
- No comment.
- Come on, knock it off.

21:34.360 --> 21:38.081
No, no, you know, whatever...
what do you call it, I plead the Fifth.

21:38.240 --> 21:40.971
Like, I tried to be helpful,
I pretended,

21:41.120 --> 21:43.771
but it didn't work out,
so I'm not gonna do that.

21:43.920 --> 21:46.764
All right, look, I realize that
I've been a little off balance lately,

21:46.920 --> 21:50.242
but I think with hindsight,
I'm learning to deal with it better.

21:50.400 --> 21:51.920
A couple of weeks counts as hindsight?

21:52.000 --> 21:53.650
Fuckin' A, Stu.

21:53.800 --> 21:54.926
I got nothing for you.

21:55.120 --> 21:58.408
Come on, come on. Look,
I'm just asking you a simple question.

21:58.560 --> 22:01.404
You don't have to candy-coat it
like you're gonna hurt my feelings,

22:01.560 --> 22:03.449
but... did you see this coming?

22:04.560 --> 22:07.689
Look, with the exception of my dog,
I haven't slept next to the same person

22:07.840 --> 22:11.003
for more than two or three days in a
row, so I don't know what I'm gonna say

22:11.160 --> 22:13.128
that's gonna be relevant
to your situation.

22:13.280 --> 22:15.169
I opened a restaurant for you, asshole.

22:15.320 --> 22:18.130
No, you opened a restaurant
for you, asshole.

22:18.280 --> 22:21.568
And according to the <i>Village</i> Voice,
it's "a bar with uninspired food."

22:21.720 --> 22:24.769
Whatever. Look, I'm simply asking
for my best friend's opinion,

22:24.920 --> 22:26.888
even it is an uninformed piece of crap.

22:27.040 --> 22:29.725
OK. "We are young.

22:31.880 --> 22:34.690
Heartache to heartache, we stand.

22:34.840 --> 22:37.730
No promises, no demands.

22:37.880 --> 22:40.611
Love is a battlefield."
Pat Benatar.

22:40.760 --> 22:42.728
You're a fucking idiot.

22:46.120 --> 22:48.885
Look, I feel like I walk on eggshells
around you.

22:50.120 --> 22:53.647
You know, uh, I tried to talk to you
about this for months...

22:53.800 --> 22:57.486
- I'm not talking about that.
- This is what I'm talking about, man.

22:57.640 --> 22:59.529
I don't know how to be
your friend anymore.

23:00.960 --> 23:03.406
You know, you're no fucking picnic.

23:05.760 --> 23:06.921
[sighs]

23:08.960 --> 23:10.485
Look, I saw her the other day.

23:11.920 --> 23:13.490
- You what?
- I saw her.

23:13.640 --> 23:15.927
- Where?
- Astor Place.

23:18.240 --> 23:19.685
- Did you talk to her?
- No.

23:19.840 --> 23:23.401
- You didn't talk to her?
- No. No. She was, uh, far away.

23:23.560 --> 23:25.927
She was walking away.
She was going to class or something.

23:26.080 --> 23:27.206
Class?

23:27.360 --> 23:29.328
Yeah. She had her book bags
with her or something.

23:29.480 --> 23:31.084
- She was going to class.
- What school?

23:31.240 --> 23:33.402
- Like NYU or Cooper Union or...
- I don't know!

23:33.560 --> 23:34.641
- The New School?
- I don't know.

23:34.800 --> 23:36.643
- It's not hard to find out.
- Why didn't you tell me?

23:36.800 --> 23:38.165
I just did.

23:38.320 --> 23:40.322
What are you guys talking about?

23:40.520 --> 23:41.567
- You.
- Oh.

25:11.120 --> 25:14.090
[music playing in the other room]

25:21.200 --> 25:22.850
[sighs]

25:26.480 --> 25:29.643
[music playing loudly]

25:32.080 --> 25:33.764
<i>Hey-</i>

25:33.920 --> 25:35.649
[turns volume down]

25:35.840 --> 25:37.251
- OK?
- Um...

25:37.400 --> 25:39.482
[raining]

25:39.880 --> 25:45.284
I'm not here to approve or disapprove,
just so you know.

25:45.760 --> 25:47.125
Hmm?

25:47.280 --> 25:51.808
Your mother always gave me crap
for never stepping up to the plate.

25:52.520 --> 25:53.567
Uh...

25:53.720 --> 25:55.324
OK. What?

25:56.520 --> 25:58.648
She said I never stepped up.

25:58.800 --> 26:01.849
Uh, I'm sorry, what does that
have to do with anything?

26:02.000 --> 26:05.163
Well... you're a bit like me.

26:05.320 --> 26:08.244
No, I'm fuckin' not.
I stepped up.

26:09.240 --> 26:10.730
OK.

26:10.920 --> 26:12.251
So what else?

26:12.400 --> 26:14.164
Nothing.

26:14.320 --> 26:16.448
Nothing. We don't have to keep talking.

26:16.600 --> 26:18.329
Yeah, but you're the one
who came into the room.

26:18.480 --> 26:21.643
- Yeah, to turn down your stupid music.
- Oh.

26:21.800 --> 26:26.169
Every day I do one thing
that makes me happy.

26:26.320 --> 26:30.723
All right, one thing.
And that is I listen to my stupid music

26:30.880 --> 26:32.769
while reading the stupid paper.

26:32.920 --> 26:35.080
And that's the best way
I've found to deal with myself.

26:35.160 --> 26:39.609
So just go back to the guest room

26:39.760 --> 26:41.808
and count the fuckin' raindrops.

26:41.960 --> 26:44.611
"Count the fuckin' raindrops"?

26:44.760 --> 26:45.921
[groans]

26:46.160 --> 26:49.607
I was never very good
at this kind of thing.

26:51.240 --> 26:52.730
[sets the glass down]

26:53.760 --> 26:55.410
OK.

26:56.800 --> 27:01.442
It isn't your job to investigate
the expansive memory

27:01.640 --> 27:03.244
that's called "the past"

27:03.400 --> 27:07.325
and judge what is right and what isn't.

27:07.520 --> 27:10.649
Seriously, what the fuck
are you talking about?

27:13.400 --> 27:15.164
[inhales deeply]

27:15.880 --> 27:17.800
You shouldn't be interested
in regretting things.

27:20.600 --> 27:22.045
I'm not.

27:22.640 --> 27:24.722
[horns honking]

28:06.160 --> 28:08.162
Let's do this.

28:09.120 --> 28:11.122
[Professor] ...intuitive answer
to this question.

28:11.280 --> 28:13.567
At the bottom,
the sense of self corresponds

28:13.720 --> 28:16.121
to that experience of ownership

28:17.080 --> 28:20.243
and impenetrability of one's thoughts,

28:20.400 --> 28:23.927
of one's internal dialogues,

28:24.080 --> 28:27.004
of one's affective states

28:27.160 --> 28:30.084
that many, but not all,

28:30.240 --> 28:32.208
- of us have from infancy.
- Hey.

28:32.360 --> 28:34.931
Can I borrow a piece
of paper and a pen?

28:35.080 --> 28:38.482
- ...solitude is held as constituting...
- Please.

28:38.640 --> 28:41.564
...our sense of personal uniqueness...

28:44.000 --> 28:47.243
Thanks. And... the pen?

28:48.440 --> 28:50.807
- And it's perhaps that very same...
- I'll give it back.

28:50.960 --> 28:55.409
...solitude that Descartes had in mind
when he redefined

28:55.560 --> 28:58.530
the concepts of subject
and subjectivity.

28:58.680 --> 29:00.444
You know, ultimately,

29:00.600 --> 29:03.763
being oneself means
that the faculty of knowing...

29:04.480 --> 29:11.011
...the faculty of knowing lies
within the subject in his head

29:11.160 --> 29:14.209
and the subject has such a status

29:14.360 --> 29:17.967
by dint of being enclosed
within himself,

29:18.120 --> 29:21.727
- separate and...
- [Conor whispering] Hi again.

29:22.920 --> 29:27.608
Would you mind passing this
to the girl with the red hair?

29:29.160 --> 29:31.003
Come on, please?

29:31.200 --> 29:35.728
...we say, "What's got into you?"
to express surprise.

29:35.880 --> 29:37.120
Thanks a lot.
Don't forgot your pen.

29:37.280 --> 29:41.683
...disapproval of
unexpected and bizarre behavior.

29:43.640 --> 29:45.290
[Professor] And again...

29:46.680 --> 29:49.411
- doesn't common sense tell us that...
- Red hair. Thank you.

29:49.600 --> 29:54.003
...strange behavior is signaled
by tapping one's forehead

29:54.160 --> 29:56.606
with one's forefinger.

30:01.120 --> 30:02.804
Boy, I'm learning something.

30:02.960 --> 30:05.122
- [Professor laughs]
- [students chuckle]

30:05.840 --> 30:10.050
"Why the Mind ls in the Head" is the
title of one of the lectures delivered

30:10.240 --> 30:16.168
- at the 1951 symposium.
- Hey.

30:16.320 --> 30:20.803
One of the most authoritative voices
in this chorus is Ken Bergens,

30:21.000 --> 30:23.890
who asked the question:

30:24.040 --> 30:28.250
Can we compellingly reinscribe
what it is to be a person...

30:28.400 --> 30:30.767
- [paper crinkling]
- ...in the way that moves us away

30:30.920 --> 30:33.810
from the individualist premise

30:33.960 --> 30:36.850
and toward the relational...

30:37.000 --> 30:38.445
[Conor] Hey!

30:39.480 --> 30:41.448
- Hey, Rigby.
- What the fuck are you doing?

30:41.600 --> 30:44.809
What? Come on, I barely got a chance
to respond before you went AWOL.

30:44.960 --> 30:46.849
- What did I ask you, Conor?
- Just give me a second to talk.

30:47.000 --> 30:48.968
- What the fuck did I ask you!
- Just give a goddamn second...

30:49.120 --> 30:52.841
I gave you plenty of seconds!
Do me a favor, leave me the fuck alone!

30:53.000 --> 30:54.081
[panting]

30:54.280 --> 30:55.441
Fine.

30:55.600 --> 30:58.160
Fine, you do what you got to do.
You just keep fuckin' walking...

31:02.120 --> 31:03.531
Conor?

31:04.720 --> 31:06.927
Oh, shit! Conor?

31:07.080 --> 31:08.127
You know this guy?

31:08.280 --> 31:10.408
He's my husband.

31:13.720 --> 31:15.484
Well, that was exciting.

31:15.680 --> 31:18.570
Yeah, it was awesome.

31:24.600 --> 31:27.171
So, you're...

31:27.360 --> 31:29.727
...you're back in school?

31:29.880 --> 31:32.690
I'm taking some classes.

31:36.320 --> 31:38.800
I almost didn't recognize you.

31:39.000 --> 31:41.287
What do you mean?

31:41.440 --> 31:43.886
It's just your hair.

31:46.160 --> 31:48.242
It's really pretty.

31:56.080 --> 31:58.003
Where are you living, El?

31:59.840 --> 32:02.081
None of your business.

32:08.880 --> 32:11.565
Is that what you so desperately
needed to talk to me about?

32:11.720 --> 32:13.085
No.

32:13.280 --> 32:15.681
What is it, then?

32:20.760 --> 32:23.570
I was gonna say something good,

32:23.720 --> 32:25.882
something that would have

32:27.320 --> 32:29.766
solved all our problems
and made everything all better,

32:29.920 --> 32:32.605
but you know what,
I forgot what it was.

32:40.960 --> 32:43.531
- That's too bad.
- Isn't it?

32:48.880 --> 32:50.291
I'm gonna go.

32:50.440 --> 32:52.090
No.

32:53.080 --> 32:54.570
All I want...

32:55.840 --> 32:58.002
...is a chance to just talk it out.

32:59.320 --> 33:01.800
Then after that,
after that you can disappear,

33:02.000 --> 33:05.129
- to wherever it is you disappear to.
- [medical officer] You ready, sir?

33:08.240 --> 33:10.561
Yeah... yeah, I was born ready.

33:10.720 --> 33:13.644
Nice and easy. Watch your step.

33:15.560 --> 33:17.050
[Conor] I'll see you around.

33:19.120 --> 33:20.929
All right, watch your head coming up.

33:21.080 --> 33:22.730
- You got him?
- I got him.

33:22.880 --> 33:25.281
Now, take it easy.

33:30.080 --> 33:32.765
- Strap in for me.
- OK.

33:36.040 --> 33:37.929
May I keep stalking you?

33:41.200 --> 33:43.123
[doors closing]

33:54.240 --> 33:57.130
[siren blaring]

33:59.280 --> 34:03.171
- [whispering] Are you awake?
- Mm.

34:03.320 --> 34:06.961
- [whispering] Auntie Em, are you awake?
- No, Philip.

34:07.120 --> 34:08.804
Your eyes are open.

34:10.520 --> 34:12.568
[sighing] Apparently.

34:12.719 --> 34:16.645
Why do you have your shoes on in bed?

34:24.600 --> 34:26.170
[laughs softly]

34:26.320 --> 34:27.889
Morning, sunshine.

34:29.920 --> 34:31.728
[Philip] Mom's making French toast.

34:31.920 --> 34:33.728
All right, I'll be right down.

34:33.920 --> 34:35.489
OK.

34:43.800 --> 34:45.165
[groans]

35:11.880 --> 35:13.245
You came in late last night.

35:19.120 --> 35:20.281
What's with the feast?

35:20.440 --> 35:23.489
We have a special guest star.

35:24.640 --> 35:25.971
[Mary] Outside.

35:32.320 --> 35:35.369
But it's been hard.
There's a barrier...

35:37.680 --> 35:39.250
Good morning.

35:43.960 --> 35:46.167
- No fucking way.
- El...

35:50.680 --> 35:52.489
You sandbagged me.

35:56.960 --> 35:59.201
He chairs the Psychology Department.

36:00.400 --> 36:02.050
Good for him.

36:02.200 --> 36:05.807
Well, I just thought he'd be
a bit more qualified to...

36:07.240 --> 36:11.404
...to deal with your circumstance.
- What's my circumstance?

36:27.760 --> 36:29.649
He was my grandson.

36:31.840 --> 36:33.763
I lost him, too.

36:51.720 --> 36:53.961
None of us know how to help you.

36:54.120 --> 36:56.441
Well, neither do I.

37:02.040 --> 37:05.249
I'm so glad they delegated
the speech to you.

37:10.360 --> 37:15.082
He's not a stranger
that some hospital referred you to.

37:15.240 --> 37:17.368
He's a colleague of mine.

37:20.600 --> 37:23.729
I don't think one session
a week would hurt.

37:23.880 --> 37:26.201
Why can't you talk to me
once a week, Dad?

37:26.360 --> 37:28.488
- Why outsource it?
- I'm not outsourcing it,

37:28.680 --> 37:32.207
and I don't really think you want
to talk to me about it.

37:32.360 --> 37:35.011
I don't need to talk
to another therapist.

37:35.160 --> 37:36.571
Eleanor...

37:36.720 --> 37:39.883
Please, stop reminding me
that something's wrong.

37:40.040 --> 37:42.725
That's... not my intention.

37:42.880 --> 37:46.885
Then... please let me
stop thinking about it.

37:55.720 --> 37:58.166
Tragedy is a foreign country.

37:59.920 --> 38:03.083
We don't know
how to talk to the natives.

38:03.240 --> 38:06.005
What are you talking about?

38:16.480 --> 38:17.891
[door closes]

38:25.560 --> 38:27.927
[footsteps approaching]

38:33.000 --> 38:36.527
You know, there's this
really cool thing called chairs.

38:36.680 --> 38:39.047
Yeah, I heard about those.

38:39.200 --> 38:41.965
It's actually not too shabby down here.

38:44.280 --> 38:45.850
You OK?

38:47.240 --> 38:48.571
Sure.

38:48.760 --> 38:50.524
Liar.

38:50.720 --> 38:52.370
Sure.

38:53.880 --> 38:55.564
When's your next class?

38:55.720 --> 38:57.290
It's yours.

38:59.080 --> 39:00.491
Oh.

39:02.680 --> 39:04.921
Do you like hamburgers?

39:06.560 --> 39:08.927
I used to be a vegan.

39:09.080 --> 39:12.448
Mostly 'cause my husband was a vegan.

39:12.600 --> 39:16.685
Not that I don't agree with most
of the tenets of vegan ideology, but...

39:16.840 --> 39:19.286
...he was one
of those reformed socialists

39:19.440 --> 39:22.569
who seemed sexy
before the '60s started to fade.

39:22.720 --> 39:24.563
Does he teach?

39:24.720 --> 39:28.202
He won tenure at University of Oregon,
and I got it here.

39:28.360 --> 39:30.681
He went soft, I stayed hard.
That was that.

39:34.520 --> 39:37.603
- You have kids?
- A son.

39:37.760 --> 39:40.127
I'm not sure why people have kids.

39:41.760 --> 39:44.491
You know, first there's
the nine months of agony,

39:44.640 --> 39:47.723
your body hurts, it's hot, it's cold,
you crave pickles,

39:47.880 --> 39:51.282
and there's no words to describe
whatever the fuck labor is.

39:51.440 --> 39:52.771
And then this little stranger comes out,

39:52.920 --> 39:54.763
sucking every bit of life
you have left in you,

39:54.920 --> 39:59.448
and as soon as you're ready to jump out
of a window, all of a sudden he smiles.

40:00.400 --> 40:01.731
[chuckles]

40:02.920 --> 40:05.287
Jesus Christ, this is good.

40:06.240 --> 40:08.811
And whatever you do,
however you do it,

40:08.960 --> 40:12.487
however you imagine your child's life,
or what kind of parent you'd be,

40:12.680 --> 40:15.365
29 years later,
he's in some shrink's office

40:15.520 --> 40:18.091
accusing you of some stupid thing
that you said or did

40:18.240 --> 40:21.687
that for the life of you
you can't remember saying or doing.

40:28.440 --> 40:31.728
Tell me at your age, you're not
taking classes out of boredom.

40:33.320 --> 40:35.368
I don't know what the hell I'm doing.

40:35.520 --> 40:37.807
What was before this?

40:37.960 --> 40:42.124
- Life in general.
- Any kids?

40:43.520 --> 40:44.726
Mmm-hmm.

40:45.160 --> 40:46.321
Boy or girl?

40:47.880 --> 40:50.360
- Boy.
- Good luck.

40:50.520 --> 40:52.045
[chuckling] Thanks.

40:52.200 --> 40:55.921
Who's that man who chased you
out of my classroom the other day?

41:01.560 --> 41:05.201
He went soft, I stayed hard.
That was that.

41:11.120 --> 41:13.726
- Well, it's been real, everybody.
- [Alexis] No, it hasn't.

41:13.880 --> 41:16.690
Hey. Goddamn it.

41:16.840 --> 41:18.330
Slow night?

41:18.480 --> 41:20.240
Couple of people came in
to use the bathroom.

41:20.280 --> 41:21.645
How we doing?

41:21.800 --> 41:25.771
Well, aside from being
an endangered species, not so good.

41:25.960 --> 41:27.564
Can you translate that for me, please?

41:27.720 --> 41:31.122
Friday night, it's the only night
we're making any money.

41:31.280 --> 41:33.851
I... I've missed some bills,

41:34.000 --> 41:36.480
and we can't cover the overhead.

41:38.120 --> 41:40.122
- I see.
- Yeah.

41:40.280 --> 41:42.328
You got a plan B?

41:44.000 --> 41:45.923
- Burger King?
- [laughing]

41:47.160 --> 41:49.080
Seriously. Come on,
I want to show you something.

41:49.120 --> 41:52.363
- This is the spreadsheet from...
- No, no, I can't. Um...

41:54.280 --> 41:55.691
[Conor whispers] Oh.

41:57.240 --> 41:58.287
You got protection?

41:59.400 --> 42:00.526
Shh.

42:00.680 --> 42:02.284
- Viagra?
- Please, be quiet.

42:02.440 --> 42:03.930
- Want me to hold your hand?
- Shut your mouth.

42:04.120 --> 42:05.281
- Can I watch?
- Shut up.

42:05.440 --> 42:07.522
Dude, I'm being serious. Shut up.
I believe.

42:07.680 --> 42:09.887
- In what?
- A higher power. Can you hear it?

42:10.040 --> 42:11.769
Not right now.

42:11.960 --> 42:13.564
- [woman] Later.
- [Stuart] Bye.

42:13.760 --> 42:15.569
- [Alexis] Bye.
- [Conor] You guys have fun.

42:16.240 --> 42:18.641
[door opens and closes]

42:21.240 --> 42:23.811
- You know, I got a plan B.
- Oh, yeah?

42:23.960 --> 42:27.089
You know what,
you can get out of here.

42:27.240 --> 42:30.449
I was thinking about getting
my real estate license.

42:30.600 --> 42:32.409
- What?
- Mmm-hmm.

42:34.080 --> 42:35.320
[Conor] Why would... [chuckles]

42:36.280 --> 42:38.408
Why would you do something like that?

42:38.560 --> 42:42.167
Uh, 'cause it seems more impressive
than pouring drinks.

42:42.320 --> 42:45.290
Does it? What happened
to your life in the arts?

42:45.440 --> 42:50.480
Oh, that'll probably phase in to a
Sunday afternoon hobby kind of thing.

42:50.640 --> 42:52.165
You?

42:52.320 --> 42:55.688
Plus, I think it's kind of indecent
to have things so worked out

42:55.880 --> 43:00.169
that they wind up exactly
like you thought they would.

43:02.040 --> 43:03.041
Oh.

43:03.200 --> 43:05.009
Are you gonna be OK?

43:05.160 --> 43:06.605
[sighs]

43:08.520 --> 43:10.045
Probably.

43:10.200 --> 43:13.682
We live in a world full of probablys.

43:15.160 --> 43:16.650
Well...

43:16.800 --> 43:18.564
I'm a decent listener...

43:18.720 --> 43:23.169
if you ever want to talk about,
you know... whatever.

43:24.960 --> 43:27.486
Talking about whatever's overrated.
I prefer just to, you know,

43:27.640 --> 43:30.086
let things stew inside of me,
then have a violent out...

43:36.520 --> 43:37.760
What'd you do that for?

43:39.480 --> 43:42.484
It just seemed like the next
interesting thing to do.

43:43.520 --> 43:45.409
I'm kind of married.

43:45.600 --> 43:47.602
Yeah, I don't mind.

43:51.720 --> 43:53.643
I kind of do.

43:53.800 --> 43:57.600
- Uh, there's nobody looking.
- You know, in another life, I...

44:03.800 --> 44:07.043
[Conor] Mmm, we shouldn't even...

44:08.360 --> 44:11.170
When's the last time that
you got laid properly?

44:11.400 --> 44:12.765
[laughs]

44:15.600 --> 44:17.489
Oh, fuck, I can already
taste the regret.

44:17.640 --> 44:20.325
Well, stop thinking,
because it's not healthy for you.

44:20.480 --> 44:22.130
- Alexis?
- Yes?

44:22.280 --> 44:24.169
Tomorrow's gonna be awkward.

44:24.320 --> 44:26.049
Probably.

44:45.200 --> 44:46.804
[glass shattering]

45:36.000 --> 45:37.161
[knocking]

45:43.680 --> 45:45.011
Oh.

45:46.320 --> 45:48.288
[whispering] What the...

45:51.800 --> 45:53.370
I'm sorry.

45:54.520 --> 45:55.851
I wasn't expecting you.

45:56.000 --> 45:57.240
No, no, no.

45:57.440 --> 46:00.967
No, I wasn't expecting me,
either, so...

46:02.840 --> 46:03.841
- Hi.
- Hey.

46:06.040 --> 46:07.246
[sighs]

46:07.400 --> 46:08.845
Is she here?

46:11.000 --> 46:12.650
No.

46:13.600 --> 46:15.568
Is she living here?

46:18.800 --> 46:20.723
Do you want to come in for a second?

46:20.920 --> 46:22.684
[sighs] Would that be all right?

46:22.880 --> 46:24.882
Yeah, come in.

46:25.040 --> 46:26.326
OK.

46:29.320 --> 46:31.527
Can I ask how she's doing?

46:35.840 --> 46:38.446
I don't know, to be completely honest.

46:40.480 --> 46:42.528
As good as she can be.

46:56.720 --> 46:58.927
Do I seem like
a different person to you?

47:00.200 --> 47:02.646
Do you feel like a different person?

47:04.120 --> 47:05.565
Kind of.

47:07.000 --> 47:08.843
You look the same to me.

47:10.640 --> 47:14.725
You know I didn't like you when Eleanor
first brought you out here for dinner.

47:14.920 --> 47:16.160
[chuckles]

47:16.440 --> 47:18.568
However long ago it was.

47:18.720 --> 47:19.881
How long ago was it?

47:20.040 --> 47:21.485
Seven years.

47:21.920 --> 47:23.081
[Mary gasps]

47:23.520 --> 47:25.807
- Seven years?
- Yeah.

47:28.640 --> 47:31.405
You sat there in the exact same spot
seven years ago,

47:31.560 --> 47:35.485
with a glass of water because you were
afraid to have a drink in front of me.

47:37.360 --> 47:40.807
This obnoxiously perfect kid who walked
off with my daughter's attention.

47:41.000 --> 47:42.525
[chuckles]

47:44.320 --> 47:45.890
You grew on me, though.

47:46.040 --> 47:47.565
Oh, well...

47:48.680 --> 47:50.330
It's true.

47:54.600 --> 47:56.250
Look, I...

47:56.400 --> 47:59.722
I don't want to interfere
with your life,

47:59.880 --> 48:03.009
or whatever she has to do,

48:03.160 --> 48:07.370
but I can't...
I can't just chalk this up to destiny.

48:09.400 --> 48:11.721
I walked on with my life because...

48:11.880 --> 48:15.043
moving forward was the only way to go.

48:19.400 --> 48:21.971
I guess people grieve differently.

48:22.120 --> 48:25.124
I wish there was some appropriate,
articulate thing to say,

48:25.280 --> 48:29.126
but I just wanted the mundane
daily bullshit back.

48:29.280 --> 48:31.601
I think Eleanor wanted something else.

48:34.360 --> 48:35.964
And I think that, um...

48:38.400 --> 48:43.167
...there was nothing appropriate
about any of this.

49:06.120 --> 49:07.963
[kids playing outside]

49:11.360 --> 49:12.407
[sighs]

49:14.520 --> 49:15.681
[door opens]

49:19.280 --> 49:21.009
[whispering] Hey.

49:22.080 --> 49:23.605
Guess what?

49:23.760 --> 49:24.921
What?

49:25.080 --> 49:27.367
I got asked out on a date.

49:28.360 --> 49:30.044
[both laughing]

49:36.040 --> 49:37.201
I feel fat.

49:37.360 --> 49:38.521
[Eleanor] Katy, shut up.

49:40.320 --> 49:41.481
[sighs]

49:41.880 --> 49:44.611
You're not fat.

50:08.320 --> 50:09.890
That's gorgeous.

50:10.040 --> 50:12.566
[Philip] Goddamn it!

50:14.000 --> 50:16.526
Uh, excuse me?

50:16.680 --> 50:18.523
- Hey, come in here.
- [door opens]

50:19.960 --> 50:21.724
What was that?

50:21.880 --> 50:24.406
This keeps breaking off.

50:24.560 --> 50:27.325
OK, but we don't say that, lovey.

50:27.480 --> 50:29.084
Why?

50:29.240 --> 50:32.449
'Cause it's not a nice thing to say.

50:32.600 --> 50:34.200
Are you sure that you're OK
to watch him?

50:34.280 --> 50:36.726
Mom and Dad should be back pretty soon.

50:36.880 --> 50:38.370
- [doorbell rings]
- He's here.

50:38.520 --> 50:40.204
Are you sure?

50:40.360 --> 50:42.488
Yes, I'm positive.

50:42.680 --> 50:44.728
- [stammers] Change.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

50:51.120 --> 50:53.043
So, what do you want to do?

50:53.520 --> 50:54.646
[chuckles]

50:56.000 --> 50:57.764
What do you want to do?

50:59.640 --> 51:02.530
Can I get electrocuted
by lightning bugs?

51:02.680 --> 51:05.570
No, they're harmless.

51:05.720 --> 51:08.326
[insects chirping]

51:17.120 --> 51:20.283
[soft music playing]

51:20.440 --> 51:23.762
This song is horrible.

51:23.920 --> 51:25.160
[chuckles]

51:25.320 --> 51:27.607
- It's not good.
- It's not.

51:27.760 --> 51:31.048
I think that bad music turns you on.

51:32.280 --> 51:33.406
Seriously.

51:33.560 --> 51:36.440
Oh, oh, oh, car, car, car, car. Do the
thing! Do the thing! Do the thing!

51:36.520 --> 51:38.887
- Do the... Shh. Shh.
- [squealing]

51:39.040 --> 51:41.646
[whispering] I don't want them
to see your ta-tas.

51:43.560 --> 51:44.925
We're good, we're good.

51:45.120 --> 51:46.804
[laughs]

51:46.960 --> 51:48.644
- Help me.
- What?

51:48.800 --> 51:51.007
You know what you're doing.

51:51.160 --> 51:53.288
[laughing] Stop it.

51:53.440 --> 51:54.851
[laughs]

51:55.000 --> 51:56.525
- There you go. Should I do it?
- Yeah.

51:56.680 --> 51:58.967
- OK, this is kind of counter-intuitive.
- [chuckles]

51:59.120 --> 52:04.490
I think I'm instinctually wired
not to be able to do this.

52:05.600 --> 52:07.329
There we go.

52:07.520 --> 52:10.603
Three, two, one.

52:10.760 --> 52:12.888
Just like that.

52:13.040 --> 52:15.202
- You look good.
- Very impressed.

52:17.680 --> 52:19.409
[sighs] We have to listen to this?

52:27.600 --> 52:28.681
Hey!

52:28.840 --> 52:30.763
You want it? You want it?

52:30.960 --> 52:33.486
- Top 40?
- No.

52:33.640 --> 52:35.563
- Country?
- No.

[country song playing]

52:39.120 --> 52:41.600
[pop song playing]

52:42.240 --> 52:43.446
Can I have some?

52:43.600 --> 52:44.761
[singing to radio]

52:44.920 --> 52:46.160
- Baby?
- Mmm-hmm.

52:46.320 --> 52:50.450
- As comfortable as this is...
- Mmm-hmm.

52:50.640 --> 52:53.689
...I'm losing circulation in my legs.

52:53.840 --> 52:56.207
- What are you trying to say?
- That you're fat.

52:56.400 --> 52:59.449
- [gasps and yells]
- And I love every pound of you.

52:59.600 --> 53:00.726
Come here.

53:00.960 --> 53:02.086
Mmm.

53:02.800 --> 53:04.006
[chuckles]

53:04.200 --> 53:05.929
Did you see where my shirt went?

53:06.120 --> 53:07.690
Try the backseat.

53:07.920 --> 53:09.251
[door opens]

53:10.640 --> 53:12.404
[grunting]

53:13.120 --> 53:15.885
- Where are you going?
- Out here.

53:21.600 --> 53:23.364
You coming?

53:23.520 --> 53:25.602
Yeah.

53:26.120 --> 53:27.485
[chuckles]

53:30.080 --> 53:33.050
[grunting]

53:33.200 --> 53:35.567
[music continues playing]

53:37.840 --> 53:39.444
Where are we?

53:39.600 --> 53:41.489
Someplace good.

54:01.000 --> 54:02.047
[squeals]

54:02.200 --> 54:03.804
[laughing]

54:05.960 --> 54:07.803
- Amazing.
- I know.

54:23.600 --> 54:25.329
[laughing]

54:28.200 --> 54:29.326
[squeals]

54:29.920 --> 54:33.208
[both laughing]

54:46.520 --> 54:48.249
[door opens]

54:54.000 --> 54:55.240
[door closes]

54:59.560 --> 55:02.245
[yawning]

55:15.880 --> 55:17.769
- It went that badly?
- [sighs]

55:20.800 --> 55:23.280
I could've given him
a normal kiss good night

55:23.440 --> 55:26.762
instead of jamming
my tongue down his throat.

55:29.400 --> 55:31.323
[both laughing]

55:41.400 --> 55:43.004
So he's cool?

55:43.160 --> 55:45.606
I am so fucked.

55:49.240 --> 55:51.607
You have a little to drink tonight?

55:51.760 --> 55:53.410
Yeah.

55:57.720 --> 55:59.006
[sighs]

55:59.320 --> 56:01.049
What's that?

56:01.200 --> 56:04.727
Philip gave it to me so I won't
be afraid of the dark.

56:05.880 --> 56:07.962
You still having trouble with that?

56:08.120 --> 56:10.122
Yeah, guess so. Come on.

56:14.600 --> 56:17.171
Were you OK with him?

56:18.320 --> 56:19.651
Yeah.

56:19.800 --> 56:21.609
Oh, I don't mean...

56:21.760 --> 56:24.047
That's not what I was...

56:25.880 --> 56:27.166
I just...

56:27.360 --> 56:28.964
I'm OK.

56:29.120 --> 56:30.485
Is it OK to be OK?

56:30.640 --> 56:33.007
- Yeah, be OK all you want.
- [both chuckle]

56:41.760 --> 56:43.046
Are you really OK?

56:44.640 --> 56:46.324
I can pretend.

56:59.040 --> 57:00.166
[grunts]

57:04.440 --> 57:07.171
All of a sudden, I kind of miss him.

57:09.680 --> 57:11.011
Who?

57:11.160 --> 57:13.766
Conor.

57:16.120 --> 57:17.724
[groans]

57:21.600 --> 57:23.568
He came by the house the other day.

57:23.720 --> 57:25.961
He talked with mom,

57:26.120 --> 57:29.249
and she told me not to tell you.

57:43.120 --> 57:44.645
I'm sorry, Katy.

57:45.480 --> 57:47.084
What for?

57:47.240 --> 57:49.402
I feel like I just dropped in
on you guys,

57:49.560 --> 57:51.608
and I sucked all the air
out of the room.

57:51.760 --> 57:53.683
You are kind of a selfish bitch.

57:53.840 --> 57:55.444
<i>Hey-</i>

57:55.600 --> 57:57.967
You don't have to be so honest.

57:58.160 --> 57:59.685
No.

57:59.840 --> 58:01.444
I was really mad at you.

58:01.600 --> 58:03.364
I know.

58:03.520 --> 58:06.490
- I'm still really mad at you.
- I know.

58:09.280 --> 58:10.361
[sighs]

58:11.600 --> 58:14.365
And you pulled the floorboards
out from under Conor.

58:21.360 --> 58:24.364
He threw Cody's stuff into the closet.

58:26.200 --> 58:30.285
And then ten minutes later,
he ordered Chinese from Madame Wu's.

58:35.720 --> 58:37.848
I tried for six months.

58:40.280 --> 58:43.443
We were a million miles away
in the same room, and...

58:47.000 --> 58:50.209
...I started to think thoughts
I never thought I'd have.

59:00.560 --> 59:03.086
How have you and mom made it this far?

59:04.160 --> 59:05.810
I'm not sure.

59:11.440 --> 59:13.442
Endurance.

59:17.520 --> 59:20.729
Everyone starts out thinking,
"This is forever."

59:22.880 --> 59:25.451
But then things get hard,

59:25.600 --> 59:28.888
at some point or another.

59:29.760 --> 59:30.921
[sighs]

59:31.080 --> 59:35.369
And then other things don't pan out
the way you thought they would.

59:47.040 --> 59:49.247
I suppose the trick is
not running for the hills,

59:49.400 --> 59:52.404
even when you think it's
the most rational thing to do.

59:58.800 --> 01:00:00.370
[sighs]

01:00:01.480 --> 01:00:03.209
I don't know.

01:00:09.840 --> 01:00:13.367
- I hate this room.
- I've seen worse.

01:00:18.480 --> 01:00:21.211
- [sighs] Where?
- Huh?

01:00:21.360 --> 01:00:23.328
Where have you seen worse?

01:00:23.480 --> 01:00:26.404
- NYU, Yale...
- Oh, Yale's butt ugly.

01:00:26.600 --> 01:00:29.171
New Haven's butt ugly.

01:00:30.960 --> 01:00:33.850
Did you attend any
of those fine institutions?

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:36.526
NYU, and then I grew up at Yale
when my dad was there.

01:00:36.680 --> 01:00:39.524
- Oh, of course, you're a faculty brat.
- Mmm-hmm.

01:00:41.120 --> 01:00:43.930
You and my son would
get along like hotcakes.

01:00:44.080 --> 01:00:46.526
Not that I'm trying to set you up
or anything.

01:00:46.680 --> 01:00:48.648
He lives in Washington, the state.

01:00:48.800 --> 01:00:52.725
He's been pretending to write a novel
there for the last four years.

01:00:55.040 --> 01:00:57.691
Learn anything interesting at NYU?

01:00:57.880 --> 01:01:00.451
I abandoned a dissertation.

01:01:00.600 --> 01:01:02.125
- Mmm, bold!
- Mmm-hmm.

01:01:02.280 --> 01:01:05.682
- What department?
- Anthropology.

01:01:05.840 --> 01:01:07.490
Mmm, social? Linguistic?

01:01:07.680 --> 01:01:09.887
I was writing an ethnography
on the social world

01:01:10.040 --> 01:01:14.728
of performance artists in Paris.
Musicians, dancers, actors, et cetera.

01:01:16.040 --> 01:01:17.644
Why?

01:01:19.440 --> 01:01:23.968
I don't know. My mom is a musician
and she's French, so...

01:01:24.120 --> 01:01:27.169
No, I mean why did you abandon it?

01:01:28.280 --> 01:01:30.886
Don't tell me something stupid
like love.

01:01:31.840 --> 01:01:33.490
[chuckles softly]

01:01:36.280 --> 01:01:38.886
You're very talkative.

01:01:39.040 --> 01:01:43.011
- It's more fun listening to you.
- You'll get over that.

01:01:43.480 --> 01:01:44.720
[chuckles]

01:01:47.120 --> 01:01:48.360
I got pregnant.

01:01:52.120 --> 01:01:54.282
Ah, that.

01:02:13.280 --> 01:02:17.046
[insects chirping]

01:02:25.920 --> 01:02:27.410
Come on, wake up.

01:02:35.520 --> 01:02:37.124
Wake up.

01:02:44.920 --> 01:02:46.251
[sighs]

01:03:01.960 --> 01:03:03.849
[Mary speaking French]

01:03:04.240 --> 01:03:05.241
What?

01:03:05.400 --> 01:03:07.084
I went into your room
to check about you,

01:03:07.240 --> 01:03:08.765
and you were gone
and the car was gone.

01:03:10.640 --> 01:03:12.130
Yeah, I went for a drive.

01:03:12.280 --> 01:03:14.408
Well, don't ever do it again.

01:03:16.160 --> 01:03:17.764
Why were you checking on me?

01:03:17.920 --> 01:03:20.287
I've always checked on you.

01:03:27.880 --> 01:03:29.609
You feeling a bit dramatic today?

01:03:29.760 --> 01:03:31.489
No, why?

01:03:34.160 --> 01:03:35.286
OK.

01:03:35.560 --> 01:03:39.451
[classical music playing]

01:03:49.760 --> 01:03:52.127
I played second violin on this.

01:03:53.960 --> 01:03:56.042
Boston Symphony. ltzhak Perlman.

01:03:56.200 --> 01:03:58.043
I haven't forgotten.

01:03:58.200 --> 01:04:01.044
No, I was just reminding myself.

01:04:20.160 --> 01:04:21.924
What?

01:04:29.760 --> 01:04:31.205
I never wanted to be a mother.

01:04:32.400 --> 01:04:34.641
Not much you can do about that now.

01:04:34.800 --> 01:04:36.086
[chuckles]

01:04:36.320 --> 01:04:38.129
Yeah. It's too late.

01:04:40.760 --> 01:04:42.603
I was too young when I had you.

01:04:42.760 --> 01:04:44.091
I was the baby.

01:04:44.240 --> 01:04:46.049
Why are you telling me this?

01:04:46.200 --> 01:04:48.089
I'm telling you this because...

01:04:48.280 --> 01:04:50.089
I don't want to lie to you.

01:04:50.280 --> 01:04:53.204
I don't want you to take
our relationship too personally.

01:04:55.440 --> 01:04:57.488
I don't.

01:05:00.600 --> 01:05:03.126
- No.
- Give... No, give me my wine.

01:05:03.280 --> 01:05:04.725
Give me my wine.

01:05:04.920 --> 01:05:07.321
Why didn't you tell me Conor came
by the house the other day?

01:05:10.600 --> 01:05:12.648
Run for your life, El.

01:05:12.840 --> 01:05:15.081
What is that supposed to mean?

01:05:15.240 --> 01:05:18.483
Well, this is all too realistic.
Run away for a while.

01:05:18.680 --> 01:05:20.364
You sure you're not projecting?

01:05:20.560 --> 01:05:23.131
Yes, yes, I'm sure I'm not projecting.

01:05:23.280 --> 01:05:24.884
You liked your semester in Paris,

01:05:25.040 --> 01:05:27.884
so why don't you go back there
and finish your dissertation?

01:05:28.040 --> 01:05:32.284
You could write in cafes,
read Le <i>Monde et</i> Les lnrocks.

01:05:32.440 --> 01:05:36.365
Eat bread, make eyes at strangers.

01:05:38.600 --> 01:05:40.090
Yeah, I could.

01:05:41.400 --> 01:05:43.448
So why are you still here?

01:05:44.560 --> 01:05:46.164
[whispering] I don't know.

01:05:49.320 --> 01:05:50.924
[Stuart] I don't get it, man.

01:05:51.080 --> 01:05:52.605
What don't you get?

01:05:52.800 --> 01:05:57.761
Well, your dad is, like,
the, like, a culinary maverick.

01:05:57.920 --> 01:06:00.002
He's, like, the Mick Jagger
of the restaurant game.

01:06:00.160 --> 01:06:02.891
All you got to do is make one phone call
and it saves our asses,

01:06:03.040 --> 01:06:05.566
but instead you want us to drown,

01:06:05.720 --> 01:06:08.530
like 90 percent
of the other restaurants in the city.

01:06:08.680 --> 01:06:10.409
- I don't get it.
- Stu, Stu...

01:06:10.560 --> 01:06:12.050
Well, I... What did he do?

01:06:12.200 --> 01:06:13.690
What do you mean, "What did he do?"

01:06:13.840 --> 01:06:14.921
Your dad, what did he do?

01:06:15.080 --> 01:06:16.969
I mean, at least take a page out
of his book. What did he do?

01:06:17.160 --> 01:06:18.685
- He married my mom.
- What does that mean?

01:06:18.840 --> 01:06:20.444
That means he married my mom.

01:06:20.600 --> 01:06:22.807
She gave him all the money
that her family left her,

01:06:22.960 --> 01:06:24.246
and he opened the restaurant.

01:06:24.400 --> 01:06:26.402
It was a big success and then
he dropped her like a bad habit.

01:06:26.560 --> 01:06:27.846
So, you know what?

01:06:28.040 --> 01:06:31.010
Why don't you go and find yourself
some lonely loaded old lady

01:06:31.160 --> 01:06:33.000
- and then we can take it from there.
- Well...

01:06:33.080 --> 01:06:36.084
You know what, I'd rather fail
catastrophically than, you know,

01:06:36.240 --> 01:06:38.641
give him the satisfaction of thinking
he handed me my life on a platter.

01:06:38.800 --> 01:06:41.610
That is the stupidest thing
in the history of stupid things

01:06:41.760 --> 01:06:43.808
- to say.
- Whoa, why is that stupid?

01:06:43.960 --> 01:06:46.361
You know what's stupid? You think I'm
gonna call my dad, and he's gonna go,

01:06:46.560 --> 01:06:49.404
"Hey, son, why don't you come and bring
your friends, they can work here, too."

01:06:49.560 --> 01:06:51.722
- Yeah!
- It's not a fucking slumber party.

01:06:51.880 --> 01:06:53.644
It's not a slumber party,
it's a job.

01:06:53.800 --> 01:06:56.770
- Stu, as decent a cook as you are...
- I'm a chef.

01:06:56.920 --> 01:07:00.686
All right, chef, you don't exactly
cut it in those kitchens.

01:07:00.840 --> 01:07:03.525
Oh, relax. You don't want
to have this conversation.

01:07:03.680 --> 01:07:06.400
No, let's talk about it. When's
the last time you julienned a carrot?

01:07:06.480 --> 01:07:07.891
- All right.
- Seriously.

01:07:08.080 --> 01:07:11.926
When's the last time you cooked an egg
and you didn't blanch the yolk?

01:07:12.080 --> 01:07:14.651
You know, in those kinds of kitchens,
in that world...

01:07:14.840 --> 01:07:17.161
- I've been pulling my weight fine.
- ...you would be a busboy.

01:07:17.320 --> 01:07:19.402
- You fuckhead. Fucking failure.
- Yeah, no. I'm telling you.

01:07:19.560 --> 01:07:22.962
- Those glasses need picking up.
- You're Spencer Ludlow's son. Fuck you.

01:07:24.240 --> 01:07:27.130
- You like that? Fucking asshole.
- Wait! Whoa!

01:07:27.280 --> 01:07:28.725
You hit me with fucking kale?

01:07:31.160 --> 01:07:33.128
That all you got? Come on.

01:07:33.280 --> 01:07:34.645
Oh, God! Jesus.

01:07:34.800 --> 01:07:35.961
[Stuart] Ow.

01:07:36.280 --> 01:07:37.441
[grunts]

01:07:37.600 --> 01:07:38.681
Ow.

01:07:40.160 --> 01:07:42.128
Ow, ow, oh.

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:45.570
[grunting]

01:07:45.720 --> 01:07:48.564
[Stuart] OK, OK, yeah, yeah.
This is what you want?

01:07:49.480 --> 01:07:51.164
[Conor and Stuart grunting]

01:07:52.760 --> 01:07:56.128
- Is that a joke?
- No, they're really going at it.

01:07:56.280 --> 01:07:59.204
- That doesn't sound so good to me.
- We're not quite open yet.

01:08:00.840 --> 01:08:02.285
[panting]

01:08:02.440 --> 01:08:07.048
I was third in my class at the New York
Academy of Culinary Arts, you fuckhead.

01:08:07.200 --> 01:08:08.884
I know that, asshole.

01:08:11.680 --> 01:08:13.682
Then cut the shit.

01:08:15.040 --> 01:08:16.484
<i>Hey-</i>

01:08:16.640 --> 01:08:19.291
I love our little set-up here.

01:08:19.439 --> 01:08:21.124
I do.

01:08:22.920 --> 01:08:24.921
But the lease has gotten
prohibitively expensive,

01:08:25.120 --> 01:08:27.964
and unless you want
to camp out in the kitchen...

01:08:28.160 --> 01:08:32.323
Yeah. I'll bring the sleeping bags.

01:08:34.880 --> 01:08:37.451
Just... time to let go.

01:08:39.840 --> 01:08:41.444
Time to grow up.

01:08:41.600 --> 01:08:43.443
I am grown up.

01:08:43.640 --> 01:08:45.926
- I am.
- Fine.

01:08:50.200 --> 01:08:52.167
When do we call it quits?

01:08:52.319 --> 01:08:54.845
End of next week.

01:08:55.760 --> 01:08:56.841
[sighs]

01:09:00.760 --> 01:09:04.367
Can we have one last banger
before we close shop?

01:09:04.520 --> 01:09:06.045
Yeah.

01:09:07.760 --> 01:09:09.569
Can we abuse some heavy narcotics?

01:09:09.720 --> 01:09:12.246
- Whatever tickles your thing.
- Good.

01:09:12.399 --> 01:09:14.640
I'm sorry.

01:09:14.800 --> 01:09:17.041
- Blow me.
- OK.

01:09:24.680 --> 01:09:26.439
[Eleanor] Yeah, it's amazing.
So you're well?

01:09:26.560 --> 01:09:28.368
[Alexis] I'm OK.

01:09:28.560 --> 01:09:30.210
- Good.
- Yeah.

01:09:30.359 --> 01:09:34.888
[Alexis] I'm just painting and here,
you know, that same stuff.

01:09:35.040 --> 01:09:36.484
- Eat me.
- Hey, hey, hey.

01:09:36.640 --> 01:09:38.608
Sorry. [chuckles]

01:09:38.760 --> 01:09:42.287
Holy Shatner.

01:09:42.439 --> 01:09:44.408
Nice to see you, too, Stuart.

01:09:48.439 --> 01:09:51.444
Well, this is nice.
Like old times, reconnecting and all.

01:09:51.600 --> 01:09:53.568
- I'm gonna go to the kitchen.
- Yeah.

01:09:54.520 --> 01:09:56.921
I will join you.

01:10:25.560 --> 01:10:26.561
Shirley Temple?

01:10:28.240 --> 01:10:29.321
Please.

01:10:43.920 --> 01:10:44.967
What do I owe you?

01:10:46.280 --> 01:10:48.442
Your money's no good here.
You know that.

01:10:48.640 --> 01:10:49.641
OK.

01:10:53.560 --> 01:10:55.005
Business is good?

01:10:55.160 --> 01:10:56.491
It's great.

01:10:59.800 --> 01:11:00.881
We're closing.

01:11:05.160 --> 01:11:06.366
- I'm sorry.
- Yeah.

01:11:07.800 --> 01:11:09.643
Yeah, me, too.

01:11:18.640 --> 01:11:20.165
So, what's next?

01:11:20.320 --> 01:11:21.731
I don't know.

01:11:22.560 --> 01:11:27.600
I thought I might...
develop some interests in things

01:11:27.800 --> 01:11:30.121
that people actually take
an interest in.

01:11:30.280 --> 01:11:32.442
You gonna work with your dad?

01:11:33.640 --> 01:11:35.722
- Hmm?
- [chuckles]

01:11:40.320 --> 01:11:42.926
You know, before you,
I had no idea who I was.

01:11:45.240 --> 01:11:47.083
Then when we were together,

01:11:48.400 --> 01:11:50.687
I thought I had it all figured out.

01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:56.607
Now I'm just back to wondering again.

01:12:00.080 --> 01:12:02.731
Well, when you figure it out,
tell me how, OK?

01:12:04.120 --> 01:12:05.724
OK.

01:12:05.920 --> 01:12:07.365
[chuckles softly]

01:12:09.080 --> 01:12:10.923
- Let's get out of here.
- What?

01:12:11.080 --> 01:12:12.206
Let's go.

01:12:12.360 --> 01:12:15.204
- Right now?
- Yeah. That's the idea.

01:12:17.840 --> 01:12:18.841
OK.

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:22.206
Yeah, uh...

01:12:30.920 --> 01:12:32.684
Don't forget to fill it up
before you drop it off.

01:12:32.840 --> 01:12:34.205
You got it.

01:12:44.320 --> 01:12:49.042
[music playing]

01:12:58.960 --> 01:13:01.327
[Spanish music playing]

01:13:02.440 --> 01:13:04.408
[pop music playing]

01:13:04.560 --> 01:13:07.530
[turns up volume]

01:13:17.920 --> 01:13:19.251
[music stops]

01:13:19.400 --> 01:13:21.004
- That.
- What are you doing?

01:13:21.160 --> 01:13:24.562
Do you want to listen to that?

01:13:24.720 --> 01:13:28.122
Yeah. Suck it up, Ludlow.

01:13:28.280 --> 01:13:32.410
[pop music playing]

01:13:39.840 --> 01:13:41.410
Is it gonna rain?

01:13:46.240 --> 01:13:47.526
[thuds]

01:13:51.480 --> 01:13:52.686
[groans]

01:13:52.840 --> 01:13:54.922
Fuck me!

01:13:55.360 --> 01:13:56.646
Ah...

01:13:58.800 --> 01:14:01.121
Of course, we get the car
with the retarded wipers.

01:14:01.280 --> 01:14:04.284
We could just wait it out.

01:14:06.400 --> 01:14:08.448
What are we doing here?

01:14:09.440 --> 01:14:13.001
You tell me. You're the one who said
that we needed to talk.

01:14:13.160 --> 01:14:15.731
You stalked me,
you went to my parents' house.

01:14:15.880 --> 01:14:16.881
What are we doing here?

01:14:17.040 --> 01:14:20.328
Just recently, like an hour ago,
you walked into my bar

01:14:20.480 --> 01:14:24.610
and you suggested we drive aimlessly
into the perfect fucking storm here.

01:14:27.160 --> 01:14:28.889
This is funny.

01:14:29.040 --> 01:14:30.883
Yeah.

01:14:31.040 --> 01:14:34.567
[chuckling]
Yeah, it's fucking hilarious.

01:14:35.720 --> 01:14:38.087
[laughs]

01:14:51.120 --> 01:14:53.800
You know, for a while there,
I thought we'd actually pieced together

01:14:53.880 --> 01:14:55.245
a pretty decent life.

01:15:03.200 --> 01:15:05.771
I have to move everything
out of the apartment next week.

01:15:07.960 --> 01:15:10.770
Do you want me to
keep anything for you?

01:15:10.920 --> 01:15:13.810
Where will you move to?

01:15:13.960 --> 01:15:15.724
I don't know.

01:15:15.880 --> 01:15:18.281
I could stay with my dad
for a little while,

01:15:18.440 --> 01:15:21.569
- until I get things figured out.
- How is he?

01:15:22.520 --> 01:15:23.965
Oh...

01:15:24.160 --> 01:15:26.891
I'm pretty certain he's losing his mind.

01:15:28.280 --> 01:15:30.726
- Fernanda left him. Yeah.
- Oh.

01:15:32.960 --> 01:15:36.760
He's getting all talkative.
Waxing philosophical.

01:15:36.920 --> 01:15:40.322
Same shit he pulls every time
he's between significant others.

01:15:40.480 --> 01:15:43.324
I think it's probably more than that.

01:15:43.480 --> 01:15:44.925
[sighs]

01:15:45.080 --> 01:15:46.730
Yeah, maybe.

01:15:48.080 --> 01:15:50.651
- At least you guys are talking.
- [chuckling wryly] Yeah.

01:15:52.240 --> 01:15:53.840
What did you tell your parents about us?

01:15:56.720 --> 01:15:57.960
What would I say?

01:15:58.120 --> 01:16:00.521
That we're fabulous.

01:16:02.320 --> 01:16:05.005
[thunder rumbling]

01:16:05.760 --> 01:16:09.526
I feel like we're living
some dreadful disaster clichÃ©.

01:16:09.680 --> 01:16:11.523
We are.

01:16:14.600 --> 01:16:16.682
[laughs]

01:16:17.120 --> 01:16:19.043
You're sopping wet.

01:16:19.200 --> 01:16:21.885
Oh, you noticed? Thank you.

01:16:22.040 --> 01:16:24.088
[laughing]

01:16:33.040 --> 01:16:34.166
[car passing by]

01:16:54.720 --> 01:16:55.926
- Wait...
- No, no, no, no.

01:16:56.080 --> 01:16:58.242
No, wait, wait.
Just a second, wait.

01:16:58.400 --> 01:16:59.686
Shh.

01:16:59.880 --> 01:17:01.530
Shit.

01:17:06.960 --> 01:17:09.088
I slept with someone else.

01:17:16.480 --> 01:17:18.562
[whispering] I'm sorry.

01:17:25.640 --> 01:17:27.642
It doesn't matter.

01:17:29.360 --> 01:17:31.249
What do you mean, it doesn't matter?

01:17:31.400 --> 01:17:33.084
Get off me.

01:17:33.240 --> 01:17:34.287
Don't, El...

01:17:34.440 --> 01:17:35.885
- Come on.
- Get off.

01:17:37.360 --> 01:17:39.442
What do you mean, it doesn't matter?

01:17:39.600 --> 01:17:42.001
Get over yourself, Conor.

01:17:45.680 --> 01:17:47.648
- You don't care?
- No.

01:17:47.800 --> 01:17:50.929
That's bullshit. I know you care.

01:17:52.080 --> 01:17:54.765
El, you're supposed to say,
"What the fuck are you thinking, Conor?"

01:17:54.920 --> 01:17:57.160
You're supposed to say,
"You're a selfish piece of shit."

01:17:57.240 --> 01:17:58.685
No.

01:17:58.840 --> 01:18:00.922
We're past that.

01:18:01.080 --> 01:18:03.890
And you just said it for me.

01:18:04.040 --> 01:18:05.929
Come on, let's go back to the city.

01:18:30.120 --> 01:18:31.724
I'm gonna get out of here.

01:19:29.160 --> 01:19:30.730
[pages rustling]

01:19:32.280 --> 01:19:34.089
- Ma'am?
- Yes?

01:19:34.400 --> 01:19:35.731
[laughs]

01:19:36.160 --> 01:19:37.605
You're a dick.

01:19:40.440 --> 01:19:42.090
And you look like ass.

01:19:42.240 --> 01:19:44.208
Thank you.

01:19:44.360 --> 01:19:46.010
Where were you last night?

01:19:51.320 --> 01:19:52.560
Do you want to take a load off?

01:19:58.080 --> 01:19:59.969
I come here on breaks.

01:20:01.800 --> 01:20:05.009
One of the librarians
advocates a whole nap philosophy.

01:20:05.200 --> 01:20:06.406
[chuckles]

01:20:06.560 --> 01:20:08.927
Nap philosophy?

01:20:09.080 --> 01:20:13.722
Yeah, naps throughout the day, like,
help with productivity and stuff.

01:20:14.680 --> 01:20:15.727
Mmm.

01:20:17.840 --> 01:20:21.162
If you want to read this.

01:20:25.880 --> 01:20:27.245
What?

01:20:30.880 --> 01:20:33.281
I was hoping you could read my mind.

01:20:33.440 --> 01:20:36.603
Wouldn't that be nice?

01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:50.243
You want to do something stupid
this weekend?

01:20:52.480 --> 01:20:56.280
Yeah. I'm the queen
of doing something stupid.

01:20:56.440 --> 01:20:58.807
What are you thinking?

01:20:58.960 --> 01:21:04.490
Get bent, take a train into the city,
save the world.

01:21:06.240 --> 01:21:08.322
When did you become an idealist?

01:21:08.480 --> 01:21:10.244
A couple seconds ago.

01:21:13.040 --> 01:21:15.486
I have a date
with the dentist this weekend.

01:21:15.680 --> 01:21:18.570
It's OK. He can be our third wheel.

01:21:20.840 --> 01:21:23.047
[loud music playing]

01:21:23.200 --> 01:21:25.521
[people chattering indistinctly]

01:21:28.040 --> 01:21:29.769
- You like drinks?
- Yeah.

01:21:29.920 --> 01:21:31.046
Yeah, I'll have a drink.

01:21:31.240 --> 01:21:33.242
- Should we get, like...
- A shot?

01:21:33.400 --> 01:21:35.482
- Three shots?
- Tequila.

01:21:37.320 --> 01:21:38.685
A round of tequila.

01:21:56.640 --> 01:21:58.802
I feel old!

01:21:58.960 --> 01:22:01.122
- What?
- I feel...

01:22:01.280 --> 01:22:03.567
I feel old!

01:22:03.720 --> 01:22:05.882
Me, too!

01:22:08.440 --> 01:22:10.124
Cheers.

01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:24.411
[laughing]

01:22:41.640 --> 01:22:43.529
What's your name?

01:22:43.680 --> 01:22:45.921
I'm good, thanks.

01:22:50.440 --> 01:22:51.851
Oh, wait.

01:23:17.840 --> 01:23:20.081
[moaning softly]

01:23:27.840 --> 01:23:29.888
[panting]

01:23:37.560 --> 01:23:39.642
- Wait... No, wait, wait, wait.
- [panting]

01:23:39.800 --> 01:23:41.643
- What? What?
- Wait.

01:23:43.400 --> 01:23:44.731
What is it?

01:23:46.200 --> 01:23:47.611
Uh...

01:23:48.240 --> 01:23:49.685
Did I hurt you?

01:23:49.840 --> 01:23:51.968
No, no.

01:23:52.120 --> 01:23:54.407
What is it?

01:23:56.280 --> 01:23:58.169
- You're a stranger.
- [chuckles]

01:23:58.320 --> 01:24:01.005
So are you.

01:24:02.440 --> 01:24:06.001
You ever have that moment where you
know you're doing something stupid,

01:24:06.160 --> 01:24:07.889
but you do it anyway?

01:24:10.040 --> 01:24:11.769
Yeah, every day.

01:24:11.920 --> 01:24:13.604
What? Come on.

01:24:13.760 --> 01:24:15.046
- No.
- Come on.

01:24:15.200 --> 01:24:16.929
Stay there.

01:24:17.080 --> 01:24:19.481
- I'm gonna go.
- No, don't go.

01:24:21.040 --> 01:24:23.202
- Don't.
- Oh, Jesus.

01:24:23.360 --> 01:24:25.567
Just stay for a minute.

01:24:27.360 --> 01:24:28.725
[Man] Really?

01:24:32.520 --> 01:24:34.249
Sorry.

01:24:42.560 --> 01:24:44.210
[horn honks]

01:24:58.720 --> 01:25:00.131
[driver] Where to?

01:25:00.320 --> 01:25:02.129
[panting] Uh...

01:25:02.320 --> 01:25:05.210
Just make a loop around the city.

01:25:05.360 --> 01:25:07.203
Got a destination?

01:25:07.360 --> 01:25:09.806
Eventually.

01:25:30.040 --> 01:25:31.041
Hey, Phoebe.

01:25:31.200 --> 01:25:32.929
- Hey, how are you?
- How are you?

01:25:33.080 --> 01:25:35.321
Good. Your hair got long.

01:25:35.520 --> 01:25:36.851
- Not really.
- Yeah.

01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:39.082
He's in his spot.

01:25:51.320 --> 01:25:52.731
[sighs]

01:25:57.920 --> 01:25:59.331
[sighs]

01:26:00.840 --> 01:26:04.401
You could make this place your own,
if you want.

01:26:04.560 --> 01:26:06.722
Do what you like with it.

01:26:06.880 --> 01:26:08.450
Seriously, I...

01:26:10.120 --> 01:26:11.326
I'm done.

01:26:12.960 --> 01:26:16.442
Used to be pretty cool,
once upon a time.

01:26:16.600 --> 01:26:20.366
Some of the same faces still show up,
except more wrinkled.

01:26:20.520 --> 01:26:22.443
- Some of them less so.
- [chuckles]

01:26:22.600 --> 01:26:25.604
The Stones were in last week
after playing the Garden,

01:26:25.760 --> 01:26:30.527
but... mostly people
are just fading away.

01:26:33.640 --> 01:26:35.722
I've been doing this way too long.

01:26:35.880 --> 01:26:38.008
I think you've done pretty good.

01:26:39.280 --> 01:26:44.002
Yeah, well... complacency scares
the shit out of me.

01:26:44.920 --> 01:26:46.763
- Yeah?
- Mmm-hmm.

01:26:46.920 --> 01:26:48.365
Then how's this?

01:26:48.520 --> 01:26:51.569
I forfeited the loan the bank gave me,

01:26:51.720 --> 01:26:53.210
I'm losing the lease on my bar,

01:26:54.120 --> 01:26:58.648
Eleanor's gone with the fucking wind.

01:27:00.280 --> 01:27:02.328
I'm 33 years old,

01:27:03.400 --> 01:27:05.528
and my life's a fucking boat wreck.

01:27:08.640 --> 01:27:10.529
I'm in my 60s.

01:27:10.680 --> 01:27:15.481
I lost a grandson this year that
I'm basically forbidden to talk about.

01:27:15.640 --> 01:27:18.211
My third wife just walked out on me,

01:27:18.360 --> 01:27:22.888
and I come here every afternoon to this
restaurant named after your mother.

01:27:28.080 --> 01:27:29.445
It's time to shoot the crow.

01:27:29.640 --> 01:27:33.486
Where are you gonna go?
You gonna fly off to Never-Never Land?

01:27:33.680 --> 01:27:36.001
- Become a Buddhist?
- [chuckles]

01:27:36.480 --> 01:27:38.767
What are you doing here, anyway?

01:27:39.840 --> 01:27:43.162
I was...
I was just in the neighborhood.

01:27:46.760 --> 01:27:49.240
"Just in the neighborhood."

01:27:50.640 --> 01:27:52.563
What is it?

01:27:57.640 --> 01:28:01.008
Do you ever wonder why we fall in love
with a specific person?

01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:05.604
Not really.

01:28:06.560 --> 01:28:08.403
I think to myself,

01:28:08.560 --> 01:28:13.168
"Something's wrong here, but I can't
quite put my finger on what it is."

01:28:16.120 --> 01:28:19.203
There's always one that haunts us.

01:28:19.360 --> 01:28:21.647
So give her time.

01:28:24.960 --> 01:28:28.760
It's the right thing to do,
given the circumstances.

01:28:30.960 --> 01:28:33.725
- Circumstances suck.
- Yeah.

01:28:40.600 --> 01:28:43.365
I really forbid you
from talking about him?

01:28:44.320 --> 01:28:45.685
Uh-huh.

01:28:49.880 --> 01:28:52.281
What the fuck are you gonna say to me?

01:29:00.240 --> 01:29:02.049
Ever since he...

01:29:05.960 --> 01:29:09.851
Ever since what happened happened,
any thought or memory of him

01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:13.049
has been something just to run my mind
as far as fuck away from as I can get,

01:29:13.240 --> 01:29:14.651
and...

01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:16.604
[stammers, sighs]

01:29:25.120 --> 01:29:28.169
A shooting star only lasts a second,

01:29:30.280 --> 01:29:35.491
but... aren't you glad
to at least have seen it?

01:29:42.760 --> 01:29:44.285
That's nice.

01:29:48.320 --> 01:29:50.800
It's a little Hallmark,
but it's nice.

01:29:52.160 --> 01:29:53.889
[chuckling] I mean it, it's nice.

01:29:54.040 --> 01:29:56.361
You have a delicate soul, Dad.

01:29:56.520 --> 01:29:58.284
Oh, nobody ever said that to me before.

01:29:59.520 --> 01:30:02.046
You know, we're in imminent danger
of sappiness.

01:30:02.200 --> 01:30:04.328
- Oh, we can't have that, can we?
- Mmm-mmm.

01:30:06.200 --> 01:30:08.487
- You hungry?
- Yeah.

01:30:08.640 --> 01:30:11.041
- I'll fix you something up.
- OK.

01:30:21.840 --> 01:30:23.126
[door opens]

01:30:29.120 --> 01:30:32.203
"All the lonely people,
where do they all come from?"

01:30:32.680 --> 01:30:33.761
Hmm?

01:30:34.520 --> 01:30:36.280
That's the Beatles song
you were named after.

01:30:36.760 --> 01:30:38.000
Ah...

01:30:38.200 --> 01:30:39.645
Three Splendas.

01:30:39.800 --> 01:30:42.406
[gasps] Wow, full service.

01:30:44.120 --> 01:30:46.401
Want me to come down there
or you want to join me in here?

01:30:56.800 --> 01:30:59.087
I think I'm gonna leave your class.

01:31:04.520 --> 01:31:06.010
[sighs]

01:31:08.880 --> 01:31:10.962
You're breaking up with me.

01:31:15.920 --> 01:31:19.766
So this is what heartbreak feels like.

01:31:19.920 --> 01:31:22.321
You never had your heart broken?

01:31:22.480 --> 01:31:24.528
Only read about it in books.

01:31:25.480 --> 01:31:27.289
Liar.

01:31:27.440 --> 01:31:29.488
Sure. [chuckles]

01:31:31.480 --> 01:31:32.891
[sighs]

01:31:35.640 --> 01:31:39.326
You know, you don't have to tell me
this. You could've just not shown up.

01:31:47.840 --> 01:31:49.365
I just got to get out of here.

01:31:51.200 --> 01:31:52.531
"Here"?

01:31:54.160 --> 01:31:56.128
- The tri-state area.
- Oh.

01:31:57.760 --> 01:32:01.810
You know, they say
that if you walk away from things,

01:32:01.960 --> 01:32:05.567
then you'll just keep walking away.

01:32:06.600 --> 01:32:10.730
Start a whole history of walk-aways.

01:32:15.160 --> 01:32:19.006
Did that sound
as lame as I thought it did?

01:32:19.160 --> 01:32:20.764
[chuckling] No.

01:32:20.920 --> 01:32:24.686
Good, 'cause I don't have a fucking clue
as to how life should be lived.

01:32:24.840 --> 01:32:27.969
Well, could you refer me
to someone who does, please?

01:32:28.120 --> 01:32:29.645
[chuckles]

01:32:32.680 --> 01:32:33.806
Yeah.

01:32:35.080 --> 01:32:36.923
I had a dog... Miles.

01:32:37.080 --> 01:32:39.481
I got him from a pound. [chuckles]

01:32:39.640 --> 01:32:40.926
He did it pretty well.

01:32:41.080 --> 01:32:44.163
Lived every day
like he won the lottery.

01:32:44.320 --> 01:32:46.243
Where's Miles when we need him?

01:32:46.400 --> 01:32:48.289
Somewhere in Pennsylvania.

01:32:48.440 --> 01:32:52.365
<i>Took him on</i> a <i>road trip,</i>
trying <i>to be</i> all <i>Travels with Charley.</i>

01:32:52.520 --> 01:32:55.524
As soon as we hit the open countryside,

01:32:55.680 --> 01:32:58.126
he starts jumping up and down
like he picked up a scent

01:32:58.280 --> 01:33:01.682
or found something
he'd always been looking for.

01:33:03.040 --> 01:33:04.280
Let him out.

01:33:04.440 --> 01:33:08.729
He hightails it,
chasing the sun to nowhere.

01:33:11.640 --> 01:33:12.721
He ran away?

01:33:12.920 --> 01:33:14.251
Mmm-hmm.

01:33:14.640 --> 01:33:16.927
I imagine he's happy
wherever he wound up.

01:33:17.080 --> 01:33:18.889
Hooked up with some Amish people.

01:33:19.040 --> 01:33:20.246
Lives on a dairy farm.

01:33:20.400 --> 01:33:22.209
- It's possible.
- [chuckles]

01:33:29.320 --> 01:33:31.846
I have a colleague at NYU.

01:33:32.040 --> 01:33:35.283
From my days of working
with your dad there.

01:33:36.960 --> 01:33:39.884
Teaches anthropology at the
American University in Paris,

01:33:40.040 --> 01:33:43.362
does some work
at the Musee du Quai Branly.

01:33:44.320 --> 01:33:46.288
I can make a phone call.

01:33:46.440 --> 01:33:49.410
Send him that dissertation
you started on.

01:33:52.800 --> 01:33:54.165
[chuckles softly]

01:33:55.880 --> 01:33:57.211
Want half a bagel?

01:33:57.400 --> 01:33:59.004
No, I'm good, I'm good.

01:33:59.160 --> 01:34:00.525
You getting enough to eat?

01:34:00.680 --> 01:34:02.967
You're starting to sound maternal.

01:34:03.120 --> 01:34:05.407
Oh, that would be a first.

01:34:07.920 --> 01:34:09.840
When's the last time you got
to talk to your son?

01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:14.844
Some holiday too long ago.

01:34:16.320 --> 01:34:18.084
Is it sad that I don't remember?

01:34:18.240 --> 01:34:20.083
Probably.

01:34:21.280 --> 01:34:23.362
I should call, shouldn't I?

01:34:25.040 --> 01:34:26.804
- Yeah.
- [softly] Yeah.

01:34:29.520 --> 01:34:31.682
Now you sound maternal.

01:34:33.120 --> 01:34:34.531
[chuckles]

01:35:38.720 --> 01:35:41.121
[line ringing]

01:35:46.920 --> 01:35:48.922
[phone ringing]

01:35:50.320 --> 01:35:51.446
Hello?

01:35:53.040 --> 01:35:54.724
Hello?

01:35:56.800 --> 01:35:58.609
Hello? [hangs up]

01:36:05.760 --> 01:36:07.046
[cradles phone]

01:37:46.440 --> 01:37:50.081
(SLOW MELODIC MUSIC PLAYING)

01:39:57.240 --> 01:39:58.446
[keys jingle]

01:41:16.960 --> 01:41:18.530
[breathing deeply]

01:41:46.720 --> 01:41:48.131
[sniffs]

01:41:55.400 --> 01:41:57.084
[sighs]

01:42:00.560 --> 01:42:01.925
<i>Hey-</i>

01:42:08.320 --> 01:42:10.607
[whispering] Do I seem like
a different person to you?

01:42:15.000 --> 01:42:17.207
You look the same to me.

01:42:24.840 --> 01:42:26.569
I'm sorry.

01:42:28.720 --> 01:42:31.121
For what?

01:42:34.200 --> 01:42:36.248
For disappearing.

01:42:52.960 --> 01:42:55.770
We'll never get to where we were.

01:42:59.080 --> 01:43:01.321
Where was that?

01:43:08.800 --> 01:43:11.087
Someplace good.

01:43:12.960 --> 01:43:14.564
Yeah.

01:43:21.680 --> 01:43:24.001
Tell me what you're thinking.

01:43:35.880 --> 01:43:38.611
I forgot what he looked like.

01:43:45.440 --> 01:43:48.887
Sometimes I'll get a glimpse
of his eyes or...

01:43:56.000 --> 01:43:59.083
...the way he'd smile at me
from his crib.

01:44:00.400 --> 01:44:02.050
[sighs]

01:44:05.240 --> 01:44:06.890
But then he'll vanish.

01:44:09.680 --> 01:44:11.967
I can't picture his face.

01:44:14.760 --> 01:44:17.286
I can't picture his face anymore.

01:44:31.560 --> 01:44:33.528
He was pale.

01:44:39.560 --> 01:44:41.847
He frowned a lot.

01:44:42.040 --> 01:44:47.809
He had your eyes, he had your nose,
he had your... your lips,

01:44:47.960 --> 01:44:52.010
he had your cheeks.
El, he was all you.

01:44:52.520 --> 01:44:53.885
[sobbing]

01:44:56.720 --> 01:44:59.610
He was the most beautiful thing
I've ever seen.

01:45:01.240 --> 01:45:02.924
[laughs]

01:45:14.760 --> 01:45:17.889
[crying] I wasn't prepared
for what this feels like.

01:45:18.080 --> 01:45:20.651
- [sighs]
- [Sobs]

01:45:21.440 --> 01:45:24.011
I know. Neither was I.

01:45:30.880 --> 01:45:32.086
[sobs]

01:46:20.000 --> 01:46:21.809
I love you.

01:46:25.680 --> 01:46:27.762
I know.

01:47:09.240 --> 01:47:11.766
- How's it coming?
- It's coming.

01:47:14.720 --> 01:47:18.611
There's a great cafe
[chuckling] called Le Cafe

01:47:18.760 --> 01:47:24.244
at the Rue Tiquetonne that
a lot of artsy fartsies go to.

01:47:24.400 --> 01:47:27.165
Your mother and I used to go there
when we visited her parents.

01:47:27.320 --> 01:47:31.006
I met Jean-Marie Le Clezio there once,
before he won his Nobel.

01:47:31.920 --> 01:47:33.206
Cool.

01:47:33.360 --> 01:47:35.681
And you should get

01:47:35.880 --> 01:47:38.690
some of those big French macaroons

01:47:38.840 --> 01:47:42.561
at Laduree

01:47:42.720 --> 01:47:45.246
in Saint-Germain.

01:47:47.360 --> 01:47:49.442
Call me when you do...

01:47:51.480 --> 01:47:54.370
...and I will live
vicariously through you.

01:47:55.400 --> 01:47:57.528
I will. Thanks.

01:48:07.560 --> 01:48:10.450
I lost you in the ocean once.

01:48:10.600 --> 01:48:12.602
What?

01:48:16.400 --> 01:48:18.323
I lost you in the ocean once.

01:48:21.360 --> 01:48:26.082
We had rented a house
at Ditch Plains Beach on Montauk,

01:48:26.240 --> 01:48:29.210
when you could afford Montauk.

01:48:29.360 --> 01:48:31.761
You were about two.

01:48:33.160 --> 01:48:35.925
Your mother was pregnant with Katy,

01:48:36.080 --> 01:48:40.802
and I took you down swimming

01:48:40.960 --> 01:48:42.405
one afternoon.

01:48:43.920 --> 01:48:46.127
Not a lot of people down there.

01:48:48.040 --> 01:48:49.087
I...

01:48:51.800 --> 01:48:53.643
I waded out...

01:48:54.720 --> 01:48:56.370
...holding you.

01:48:57.920 --> 01:49:01.003
Thinking, at one point,
"This might not be the best idea."

01:49:03.960 --> 01:49:05.803
But you were game.

01:49:07.920 --> 01:49:12.448
Or I imagined that you were game
because you never, ever seemed scared.

01:49:14.680 --> 01:49:16.330
Of anything.

01:49:18.160 --> 01:49:20.083
The Atlantic is moody,

01:49:20.280 --> 01:49:23.363
and a big set of waves snuck in.

01:49:23.520 --> 01:49:27.923
We made it under the first one.

01:49:30.240 --> 01:49:32.322
You were clinging to my neck.

01:49:32.480 --> 01:49:35.768
But we got caught
in front of the second.

01:49:39.640 --> 01:49:41.608
And I came up without you.

01:49:44.360 --> 01:49:48.809
I have never felt anything like that.

01:49:51.120 --> 01:49:55.170
The throes of that
stupid couple seconds,

01:49:56.280 --> 01:49:58.328
treading the white water.

01:50:02.440 --> 01:50:05.683
And then, miraculously, I...

01:50:08.560 --> 01:50:10.927
...felt you at my feet.

01:50:13.840 --> 01:50:15.842
I never told your mother.

01:50:16.040 --> 01:50:18.247
I never told anyone.

01:50:18.400 --> 01:50:22.883
That was the worst
and the best moment of my life.

01:50:43.320 --> 01:50:44.731
OK.

01:50:46.040 --> 01:50:48.441
- Is this ready?
- Yeah.

01:50:50.400 --> 01:50:53.131
- I'll be downstairs in a bit.
- OK.

01:51:48.840 --> 01:51:50.171
[Philip laughing]

01:51:56.480 --> 01:51:57.845
What have you got?

01:51:58.000 --> 01:51:59.490
Chardonnay.

01:52:05.360 --> 01:52:06.885
- It's good? Hmm?
- Hmm.

01:52:09.000 --> 01:52:10.286
Mmm.

01:52:11.040 --> 01:52:13.520
You know I'm full of shit, right?

01:52:13.680 --> 01:52:15.569
- Depends on the day.
- [chuckles]

01:52:17.480 --> 01:52:19.323
But you know that I love you, hmm?

01:52:27.160 --> 01:52:28.844
Say good-bye to Auntie Em, OK?

01:52:29.720 --> 01:52:30.881
[gasps] OK. [grunts]

01:52:31.040 --> 01:52:33.725
Good-bye, chickadee.
You make sure that they behave, OK?

01:52:33.880 --> 01:52:36.087
- OK.
- OK, kiss.

01:52:38.720 --> 01:52:40.802
What time is it in France?

01:52:40.960 --> 01:52:43.201
[Katy] Um, it is past your bedtime.

01:52:43.400 --> 01:52:44.811
[Philip] Why?

01:52:49.040 --> 01:52:50.530
Don't be a stranger.

01:52:52.600 --> 01:52:53.931
I won't.

01:52:55.560 --> 01:52:58.245
[Philip] I don't want to go to bed.
It's still light out.

01:52:58.400 --> 01:53:00.607
You don't have to go to bed, sweetie.

01:53:00.760 --> 01:53:02.091
Be good, OK? I'll be back.

01:53:02.240 --> 01:53:04.322
[Philip] When is Auntie Em coming back?

01:53:04.480 --> 01:53:06.369
[Julian] She'll be back next summer.

01:53:51.080 --> 01:53:54.687
Hey, guys, I'm gonna go take a stroll
before the rush, OK?

01:53:54.840 --> 01:53:56.444
- [Phoebe] OK.
- OK.

01:53:57.600 --> 01:53:59.682
Aren't you worried about
these 15 people in that section?

01:53:59.840 --> 01:54:01.251
What are we going to do with them?

01:54:01.400 --> 01:54:03.760
Um, you know what we do is we
open up this back room here...

01:55:31.120 --> 01:55:35.648
[indistinct chatter]
