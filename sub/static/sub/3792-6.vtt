4x06 The WeHo Ho

01:13.362 --> 01:15.931
Hello, E, what a pleasant
pick-me-up start to my morning.

01:16.218 --> 01:17.675
Yeah, blow me too, Ari.

01:17.790 --> 01:18.815
Whoo, sugar mouth!

01:18.910 --> 01:20.742
All the blood just rushed
to my power source.

01:20.761 --> 01:21.777
What's up?

01:21.834 --> 01:23.483
We don't want to do
the movie with Walsh.

01:23.559 --> 01:24.745
- What do you mean?
- I said,

01:24.785 --> 01:27.019
- We want to find another director.
- Another director?

01:27.098 --> 01:30.172
Are you out of your mind?
What, has Walsh been teasing you again?

01:30.257 --> 01:31.846
The guy called me a liar and a thief.

01:32.398 --> 01:33.636
Sticks and stones.

01:33.794 --> 01:36.395
You can't throw away a movie
just 'cause you can't get along.

01:36.971 --> 01:39.276
It's Vince's decision,
not mine, Ari, so let's move on.

01:39.432 --> 01:42.204
I don't think you realize
that I pulled off a miracle here.

01:42.322 --> 01:45.160
<i>48 hours ago,
Vince was unemployable.</i>

01:45.301 --> 01:47.939
He wants to do the movie,
but not with Walsh. What's the big deal?

01:47.991 --> 01:50.500
The big deal is
I sold them on a package...

01:50.681 --> 01:52.215
<i>The Medellin package.</i>

01:52.344 --> 01:54.451
We start saying that part
of that package is no good

01:54.525 --> 01:57.318
and they start asking questions
that we're not prepared to answer,

01:57.447 --> 01:59.723
<i>like "is Medellin really that good?"</i>

01:59.952 --> 02:02.197
<i>do you want to answer that, E?</i>

02:02.855 --> 02:04.443
That's what I thought. Now...

02:04.598 --> 02:07.106
You're supposed to be
in Dana Gordon's office this afternoon.

02:07.231 --> 02:10.179
<i>I want you to talk to
Vince again before I cancel.</i>

02:10.271 --> 02:12.341
I parted the Red Sea for you, E.

02:12.508 --> 02:14.034
Don't piss on the sand.

02:15.287 --> 02:17.280
- That Ari?
- Yep. He's not happy.

02:17.823 --> 02:19.594
You are gonna be delighted
when you taste

02:19.698 --> 02:22.033
these fresh,
hand-picked strawberry waffles.

02:22.368 --> 02:24.954
- Nice. Where do you pick waffles from?
- Clever, E.

02:25.264 --> 02:27.566
Look at that big fat bad boy
I saved just for you.

02:27.702 --> 02:29.099
Thank you very much, Drama.

02:31.455 --> 02:33.291
- Walsh again.
- You gonna answer?

02:33.484 --> 02:36.641
Well, let's see. His last email :
"Admit you leaked my trailer and die."

02:36.745 --> 02:39.325
- So no, I don't think so.
- Fuck Ari if he's not happy.

02:39.862 --> 02:41.444
We obviously can't work like this.

02:41.522 --> 02:43.290
<i>Which is too bad
because Lost in the Clouds</i>

02:43.362 --> 02:45.430
would have been a great
movie with Billy directing.

02:45.456 --> 02:48.249
We'll find another great director,
even if I have to find him myself.

02:48.304 --> 02:51.252
Anyone interested in driving out
to Palmdale to see my cousin Ronnie?

02:52.182 --> 02:54.018
Haven't we been through
this already, Turtle?

02:54.096 --> 02:56.908
I'm telling you, guys, he says
he has a little money-making venture.

02:56.976 --> 02:58.804
And in my house,
when cousin Ronnie talks,

02:58.907 --> 03:00.924
like E.F. Hutton,
you better fuckin' listen.

03:01.044 --> 03:02.967
Why do you have so much
confidence in him again?

03:03.019 --> 03:05.812
Are you kidding? You know the guy
always knew how to make a buck.

03:05.952 --> 03:09.036
You don't remember? He was the first
guy on our block to have a foreign car.

03:09.076 --> 03:10.722
The first guy to have an in-ground pool.

03:10.864 --> 03:12.490
The first guy to have aluminum siding.

03:12.558 --> 03:15.183
Yeah, and the first guy to have
it all seized by the government.

03:15.390 --> 03:16.890
That's 'cause he didn't pay his taxes

03:16.942 --> 03:18.675
not 'cause
he wasn't rollin' in the green.

03:18.778 --> 03:20.240
What's the investment opportunity?

03:20.318 --> 03:22.412
Now he wouldn't say
on the phone, which means...

03:22.780 --> 03:24.402
He's on the inside, as usual.

03:24.690 --> 03:26.449
- Now, who's in?
- Not me.

03:26.828 --> 03:28.768
I'll drive out
to the desert with you, Turtle,

03:28.923 --> 03:30.656
maybe hit the outlets along the way.

03:31.006 --> 03:32.997
But don't count on me
parting with any cash.

03:33.479 --> 03:34.824
Like I ever do.

03:45.886 --> 03:48.498
- Is there a fax waiting for me?
- I don't think so.

03:48.537 --> 03:51.329
Just got off the phone with Dana.
She said she sent over Vinny's offer

03:51.397 --> 03:52.845
- an hour ago.
- I haven't seen it.

03:53.027 --> 03:55.561
Well, get up, open your eyes wide
and go find it.

03:55.639 --> 03:56.906
Zoom zoom.

04:02.771 --> 04:03.961
Hey, dumbfuck!

04:06.033 --> 04:07.636
Please don't be mean to me today.

04:07.780 --> 04:09.714
Is this not an offer
with Vinny's name on it?

04:10.435 --> 04:12.064
Yes, it is. I apologize.

04:12.245 --> 04:13.409
What's wrong with you?

04:14.887 --> 04:15.947
Speak!

04:16.095 --> 04:18.060
- Tom broke up with me.
- Oh, Jesus.

04:18.259 --> 04:19.447
And I don't know what to do.

04:19.487 --> 04:20.886
Well, I tell you what you don't do:

04:20.937 --> 04:23.523
you don't bring it into work
and you don't bring it to me, okay?

04:23.601 --> 04:26.022
Because you know that me thinking
about you and tom doing...

04:26.126 --> 04:27.203
You know, makes me sick.

04:27.311 --> 04:31.169
So let's focus on work and not on Tom
and everything's going to be okay. Okay?

04:32.171 --> 04:33.386
Get E on the horn

04:33.546 --> 04:35.795
so I can tell him
Vinny is the six million dollar man.

04:35.911 --> 04:38.053
That should knock some sense into him.
Maybe.

04:38.988 --> 04:40.540
How long should I just sit in here?

04:40.643 --> 04:42.764
Oh, I forgot to tell you...
your 10:00 a.m. Is here.

04:42.816 --> 04:44.626
Your forgot to tell me
I had a 10:00 a.m.

04:48.487 --> 04:50.085
How are you, mr. Walsh?

04:50.581 --> 04:53.581
I'll tell you after you tell me
what kind of deal I'm gonna get

04:53.786 --> 04:55.234
if I let you be my agent.

04:56.840 --> 04:58.081
When I spoke to you yesterday,

04:58.107 --> 05:00.642
you didn't tell me that there
was a problem between you and E.

05:00.693 --> 05:03.478
Now, unless you handle that,
there's not gonna be any deal

05:03.530 --> 05:05.303
and I'm not gonna
be able to represent you.

05:05.364 --> 05:07.071
I've been trying
to handle it all morning,

05:07.161 --> 05:09.670
but I can't get the pale prick
on the phone. Maybe you can.

05:10.601 --> 05:13.264
I'm sure I can.
That's what I do. I connect people.

05:18.671 --> 05:19.809
Give me one second.

05:21.664 --> 05:23.293
Lloyd! Snap out of it.

05:23.423 --> 05:24.457
Did you call E?

05:25.078 --> 05:26.159
Call now. Forget the offer.

05:26.211 --> 05:28.538
Ask him if he and Vince will
please come here immediately.

05:28.590 --> 05:30.374
And tell him
that I used the word "please".

05:31.124 --> 05:32.236
- But Ari?
- Yes?

05:32.507 --> 05:33.671
Do you mind dialing?

05:33.749 --> 05:36.723
In my traumatized state this morning,
I forgot to put in my contacts.

05:37.877 --> 05:39.015
Billy, I'll be right there.

05:39.092 --> 05:41.688
Why do you have to be so skeptical
about everything?

05:41.921 --> 05:43.578
Only because I care about you,

05:43.681 --> 05:45.802
and I don't want to see
your little hopes get dashed.

05:45.869 --> 05:47.846
You're just jealous
'cause you never cashed in

05:47.913 --> 05:50.019
on any of cousin Ronnie's
windfalls in the past.

05:50.148 --> 05:51.933
My talent is my windfall.

05:52.006 --> 05:55.946
And you, sadly, and I mean no disrespect
by this, don't have a talent.

05:56.075 --> 05:58.066
So, for you to take
all your cash and to flush...

05:58.144 --> 05:59.916
My talent is knowing my limitations,

05:59.994 --> 06:02.037
which is why
I'm only putting half my money in.

06:02.140 --> 06:03.537
So don't sweat it.

06:04.220 --> 06:05.513
This is the place.

06:05.887 --> 06:07.568
- This is where he's staying?
- Yep.

06:08.200 --> 06:09.660
Oh, yeah. He's rolling in it.

06:10.821 --> 06:12.089
Get out of the car, you punk!

06:13.938 --> 06:16.447
- You scared the hell out of me...
- What's up?

06:16.749 --> 06:18.120
What, now that you're a big celeb,

06:18.172 --> 06:20.370
I'm sure this shit happens
to you all the time, right?

06:20.732 --> 06:22.025
Congrats on the show.

06:22.206 --> 06:24.114
- You been watching?
- I have. It's terrible.

06:24.331 --> 06:26.089
Eh, but I heard
the networks pay big bucks,

06:26.141 --> 06:27.564
so who gives a fuck, right?

06:27.929 --> 06:29.946
- Turtle, come here. Give me a hug!
- How are you?

06:29.998 --> 06:31.239
- Good.
- What's going on?

06:31.317 --> 06:32.842
Ah, you know, just wheelin' and deal'.

06:32.920 --> 06:34.342
So, what do you got for us?

06:35.061 --> 06:37.097
Let's go upstairs.
I don't want to talk out here.

06:37.806 --> 06:39.306
Good to see you guys, man!

06:39.799 --> 06:41.651
- Great to see you.
- This your car, Ronnie?

06:42.435 --> 06:43.525
Dick.

06:43.706 --> 06:46.163
I'm just saying,
don't let Ari get to you.

06:46.275 --> 06:48.506
- Why would he get to me?
- iI he yells at you, I mean.

06:48.574 --> 06:50.308
All of the sudden I'm Mr. Sensitive?

06:50.941 --> 06:53.010
You have been getting
in a lot of fights lately.

06:53.133 --> 06:54.426
I won't let him get to me.

06:54.683 --> 06:56.261
- You promise?
- I promise.

06:56.867 --> 06:58.005
Motherfucker!

06:59.231 --> 07:01.016
- What the fuck is this?
- I have no idea.

07:01.300 --> 07:03.705
Just take it easy.
He comes bringing peace.

07:03.744 --> 07:05.554
- I'm waving the white flag, suit.
- Why?

07:05.654 --> 07:07.258
Because I was wrong and I'm sorry.

07:07.362 --> 07:09.147
You're admitting
I didn't leak the trailer?

07:09.181 --> 07:11.612
- I am.
- That's why he came here this morning.

07:11.715 --> 07:14.582
- He said you wouldn't call him back.
- He sent an E-mail at 4:00 a.m.

07:14.658 --> 07:17.454
- threatening to kill me.
- Then at 5:00 a.M., my editor

07:17.626 --> 07:20.108
called and told me that he got pissed
at his girl last week

07:20.186 --> 07:23.470
and put a video of him giving
her a facial on cumfiesta.com.

07:23.704 --> 07:25.902
She got back at him
with my trailer, our trailer.

07:27.008 --> 07:29.614
- You're a real asshole, you know that?
- I'm man enough to admit

07:29.682 --> 07:32.105
- when I've been acting like one.
- Admit the other thing.

07:33.043 --> 07:34.439
<i>I love Lost in the clouds, Vin.</i>

07:34.491 --> 07:37.465
I read that book four times. I could
shoot the shit out of that thing.

07:37.986 --> 07:40.572
- We don't doubt that.
- Okay now, so...

07:41.093 --> 07:42.270
Are we gonna make this movie?

07:42.348 --> 07:44.763
Are we gonna go talk to Dana Gordon?
What do you say, boys?

07:47.566 --> 07:49.267
Come on, E!
As much as we fight,

07:49.335 --> 07:51.219
you know I think
of you and Vinny as family.

07:52.138 --> 07:54.391
Want to climb this mountain together?
We'll kill it.

07:56.272 --> 07:57.306
Sure.

07:57.482 --> 07:59.034
Come here, you motherfucker.

07:59.779 --> 08:01.713
Would you look at that?
Love is in the air!

08:01.781 --> 08:03.693
Is this beautiful or what, Lloyd?

08:03.904 --> 08:05.637
Come and join us in a group hug!

08:06.007 --> 08:07.688
Could be a while before you get some.

08:09.365 --> 08:11.439
Aw, come on!
I was just teasing, Lloyd!

08:11.517 --> 08:13.625
It was a joke!
I'll be right back.

08:18.879 --> 08:20.302
They don't fuck each other, do they?

08:20.428 --> 08:22.626
Come on, I was just trying
to cheer you up!

08:22.781 --> 08:25.418
There is no cheering me up.
My life is over.

08:25.573 --> 08:27.746
- It's not over!
- Yes, it is.

08:27.901 --> 08:29.704
Without Tom, my life is empty.

08:30.225 --> 08:31.441
An empty vase!

08:32.548 --> 08:35.080
- Why a vase?
- Because Tom was a flower.

08:35.587 --> 08:37.760
He was, Ari!
He was a rose,

08:38.080 --> 08:41.609
a bright red rose
in the massive oil spill of life.

08:41.789 --> 08:43.496
And without him, everything is just...

08:43.928 --> 08:45.015
Gooky!

08:45.144 --> 08:46.801
- Don't laugh at me!
- I'm not laughing,

08:46.905 --> 08:49.387
- but "gooky" is funny.
- I need to take a leave of absence.

08:49.543 --> 08:51.190
- No, you don't.
- I do! I am...

08:52.019 --> 08:53.855
You're a rising star in this company.

08:53.996 --> 08:56.143
- No time for maternity leave.
- Sorry, Ari.

08:56.246 --> 08:58.212
Lloyd, you're gonna
set yourself back years!

08:58.737 --> 09:00.105
What will I do?!

09:03.709 --> 09:04.892
50 grand, huh?

09:05.371 --> 09:08.204
And I'm letting you in on this
because you're my blood and I love you.

09:08.308 --> 09:09.989
and I can only raise 30 grand on my own

09:10.152 --> 09:12.710
'cause the IRS, those cocksuckers,
froze my assets again.

09:12.787 --> 09:15.296
- And so you need 20 grand, then?
- What are you, rain man?

09:15.425 --> 09:16.796
That's what I just told you.

09:17.292 --> 09:18.456
So'd you bring it, or what?

09:18.533 --> 09:20.499
I got it.
It's a check. It's good.

09:20.654 --> 09:21.766
There you go!

09:22.728 --> 09:23.907
Last of my Saigon money.

09:23.944 --> 09:25.729
Just what is this investment already?

09:25.806 --> 09:29.183
- Baseball memorabilia.
- Baseball memorabilia?

09:29.402 --> 09:31.045
Not just any baseball memorabilia.

09:31.203 --> 09:35.740
I'm talking about a Sandy Koufax
game-used home jersey from '66.

09:35.929 --> 09:37.532
50 grand for a jersey?!

09:37.610 --> 09:40.299
That ain't shit, Drama. It's gonna
be worth twice as much as that.

09:40.384 --> 09:41.884
- At least.
- How do you know?

09:41.994 --> 09:44.649
My father, the prick,
is obsessed with Sandy.

09:45.303 --> 09:46.510
He bought a condo in st. Paul

09:46.561 --> 09:48.630
'cause Sandy was living
in the same development.

09:48.785 --> 09:50.517
- So?
- So, my father,

09:50.573 --> 09:52.048
the demented fuck that he is,

09:52.359 --> 09:55.281
makes his tee time
the same as Sandy's every wednesday.

09:55.410 --> 09:58.291
- So what, Ronnie?
- So Sandy hasn't teed off in weeks.

09:58.497 --> 10:00.332
Wait, I don't follow, why not?

10:01.243 --> 10:03.571
Jesus christ, you guys
are fuckin' slow, huh?

10:04.070 --> 10:05.551
Sandy's finished. He's done.

10:05.774 --> 10:07.138
His place is a hospice.

10:07.338 --> 10:09.898
White coats coming and going
for the last two weeks.

10:11.010 --> 10:12.536
Just a matter of time.

10:12.820 --> 10:14.217
Sandy Koufax is gonna die?

10:15.100 --> 10:16.523
Jesus christ, that's terrible.

10:16.682 --> 10:19.549
Yeah, indeed, it is.
My father, he's been a wreck for weeks.

10:20.275 --> 10:21.982
But hey, we gotta make a buck, right?

10:23.381 --> 10:25.502
Could you imagine
being able to buy a Picasso

10:25.840 --> 10:28.917
a week before his demise?
We can!

10:31.297 --> 10:33.715
So you can pack the camera in the snow,

10:33.897 --> 10:37.287
have it pointing straight down
the face of the cliff and then...

10:37.519 --> 10:39.200
Vinny's beautiful mug pops out,

10:39.330 --> 10:41.809
just those big blue eyes

10:42.184 --> 10:45.880
with the bright, white snow
surrounding them. It'll be magical.

10:45.996 --> 10:47.859
- Sounds like it.
- What do you think, E?

10:47.988 --> 10:49.307
Sounds great.

10:51.220 --> 10:53.600
Hi... Guys.
I'm really sorry,

10:53.753 --> 10:55.625
but I called Ari's office
earlier this morning

10:55.682 --> 10:57.907
and asked if the meeting
could be pushed back an hour.

10:57.984 --> 10:59.907
I'm sorry no one told you.
I hope that's okay.

10:59.985 --> 11:01.614
Actually, little lady, it ain't.

11:01.694 --> 11:03.168
So would you please call Dana

11:03.245 --> 11:05.944
and tell her
that I gotta be at the track at 4:15

11:06.099 --> 11:08.944
so she better hustle on
down here or I will be gone!

11:09.860 --> 11:11.697
Is this how they run shit
down at Ari's shop?

11:11.788 --> 11:13.210
Relax, I'm calling.

11:14.916 --> 11:17.831
Okay, I'm sorry.
How do you spell that? is that, uh,

11:17.909 --> 11:20.055
m- u-r-f...

11:20.279 --> 11:21.607
No no no, "p."

11:21.814 --> 11:23.798
...F-p-h-E-y.

11:24.031 --> 11:25.815
And you work with Vincent Chase?

11:26.097 --> 11:27.804
Look, just have him call E, okay?

11:28.394 --> 11:30.205
Who the fuck are you
and what are you doing?

11:30.670 --> 11:31.730
Hi, I'm...

11:32.266 --> 11:33.326
Ari, what's going on?

11:33.430 --> 11:35.028
Sorry, I'm having an assistant meltdown.

11:35.080 --> 11:36.703
Why aren't you in the meeting with Dana?

11:36.781 --> 11:38.746
Dana pushed the meeting,
but no one told us.

11:39.360 --> 11:42.042
Tell Eric the meeting was pushed back
an hour. I just saw this!

11:42.223 --> 11:44.336
Listen, is there any way
you can wait it out, buddy?

11:44.403 --> 11:46.132
- Yeah, we're fine.
- I'm not fine!

11:47.042 --> 11:49.332
- Although Walsh is really pissed.
- Let me talk to him.

11:49.436 --> 11:50.625
Ari wants to talk to you.

11:50.677 --> 11:53.496
Fuck Ari! Tell him I haven't
signed those agency papers yet.

11:54.283 --> 11:55.292
I heard him.

11:55.348 --> 11:57.083
- I'll talk to you later.
- Later. Listen.

11:57.134 --> 11:58.298
Let me know how it goes.

11:59.414 --> 12:01.819
I need a fucking assistant!

12:02.806 --> 12:04.978
As I was saying, Mr. Gold, I'm Glen...

12:05.526 --> 12:07.660
Glen Holden. I'm gonna
come off Eric Siegel's desk...

12:07.712 --> 12:08.875
How do I know you?

12:08.927 --> 12:10.789
You fired me
from the mailroom two years ago,

12:10.866 --> 12:13.031
but you realized you were wrong,
so you hired me back.

12:13.099 --> 12:15.533
No, I can get the job done.
Just tell me what you like.

12:15.601 --> 12:16.920
No, I don't tell you what I like.

12:16.972 --> 12:19.144
My old assistant is supposed
to tell you what I like.

12:19.196 --> 12:21.239
And then he is supposed
to seamlessly train you

12:21.342 --> 12:23.014
so that the only change in my life

12:23.195 --> 12:25.497
comes when I have to write out
a christmas bonus check.

12:25.574 --> 12:26.945
Okay, Mr. Gold, please look it.

12:27.023 --> 12:28.626
- I'm just gonna...
- Get out of here.

12:28.704 --> 12:31.400
- Where do you want me to go?
- Anywhere but here or I'll kill you.

12:31.426 --> 12:33.003
Do you want me to get you someone else?

12:33.085 --> 12:35.205
No, I only want Lloyd
and I will get him myself!

12:38.355 --> 12:39.907
Stop looking at me like that.

12:40.248 --> 12:42.317
We were never guys
who were about money.

12:42.429 --> 12:44.576
We were always guys
who were about integrity.

12:44.886 --> 12:46.619
Is that what got you
to do that commercial

12:46.670 --> 12:49.234
where you and your wife
had a bad case of the runs at the opera?

12:49.301 --> 12:50.730
That was a national spot.

12:51.037 --> 12:52.882
And I got a chance
to show a lot of range.

12:53.456 --> 12:55.794
All right, look,
I don't feel great about this either.

12:56.116 --> 12:58.237
But if we don't buy it,
somebody else will.

12:58.728 --> 13:01.211
Besides, I can't let Ronnie down.

13:01.288 --> 13:04.314
You know how many times he gave
my mother money when my father wouldn't?

13:04.547 --> 13:06.187
If I don't do it, he won't be able to.

13:06.291 --> 13:08.799
So, if you still want in for half,
you got it.

13:08.988 --> 13:12.646
It's blood money.
So, never. Never never.

13:13.328 --> 13:14.802
Let's go make a bundle, huh?

13:16.178 --> 13:17.652
Come on, let's go, let's go.

13:17.833 --> 13:20.298
- Why does this guy look so morbid?
- He always looks morbid.

13:20.762 --> 13:22.223
... Game-worn jersey!

13:22.391 --> 13:25.697
Bidding starts at $1,000.
Do I hear $1,500?

13:25.800 --> 13:28.775
$1,500! Do I hear $2,000?
$2,000 in the back!

13:30.061 --> 13:32.130
I am so sorry about the mix-up.

13:32.299 --> 13:34.135
Hey, we got nothing better to do, right?

13:35.815 --> 13:36.948
How are you guys?

13:37.207 --> 13:39.696
It's great to see you.
Why don't you come on in my office?

13:44.290 --> 13:46.843
So, we are hoping to go
into production in 12 weeks.

13:46.895 --> 13:51.095
And we've got a preliminary
budget estimate of $55 million.

13:51.199 --> 13:54.579
55, well that is obviously ridiculous.

13:55.018 --> 13:57.010
Is it?
There's not even a script yet.

13:57.087 --> 13:59.047
Well, I'd be writing the script, right?

13:59.098 --> 14:00.805
And I know this book inside out.

14:00.883 --> 14:03.133
And as big as it is,
I want to visualize it bigger.

14:03.167 --> 14:06.077
I want the blizzard
to make the... The desert

14:06.145 --> 14:08.974
in "lawrence of arabia"
look like a fucking sandbox.

14:09.179 --> 14:11.170
And I won't speak for
anybody else in this room,

14:11.274 --> 14:13.808
<i>but for me, after what I just
pulled off on Medellin</i>

14:13.912 --> 14:16.140
with no budget,
I'd rather wait

14:16.787 --> 14:20.149
to collect my gold statue
and have dollars start flying at me

14:20.205 --> 14:22.662
than get involved
in an underfinanced project again.

14:22.817 --> 14:25.106
<i>So you think you're gonna win
an oscar for Medellin?</i>

14:25.184 --> 14:26.994
I'd bet my left pinkie that me and Vince

14:27.072 --> 14:29.684
are both gonna get one,
and E might even be lucky enough

14:29.761 --> 14:32.032
to ride our coattails
right onto that stage.

14:32.873 --> 14:34.425
You mind if I use your private shitter?

14:34.477 --> 14:37.373
I just gotta piss, but the one in
the hallway stank like a refugee boat.

14:37.476 --> 14:38.955
Sure, go ahead.

14:39.779 --> 14:40.945
He's quite a character.

14:41.368 --> 14:42.635
He's all bluster.

14:42.873 --> 14:44.632
But he knows exactly what he's doing.

14:45.234 --> 14:46.527
Well, it's kinda weird.

14:47.041 --> 14:48.619
I mean, he's foul and grotesque,

14:48.961 --> 14:50.487
conceited and abhorrent.

14:51.624 --> 14:52.917
But I kinda like him.

15:21.588 --> 15:24.071
Livin' large, Lloyd.
Looks like I'm paying you too much.

15:24.499 --> 15:28.094
I have family money. And it
hasn't affected my work ethic at all,

15:28.172 --> 15:30.861
- so don't make fun of me.
- I'm not making fun of you.

15:30.913 --> 15:32.667
I'm here because I need you back.

15:34.108 --> 15:37.802
Listen, the best way
to get over a breakup

15:37.870 --> 15:40.275
is a distraction,
and the best distraction is work.

15:40.473 --> 15:42.447
Work is the reason we broke up.

15:42.908 --> 15:46.218
Tom hated that I was never home,
he hated my hours.

15:46.512 --> 15:48.155
<i>Work ripped us apart.</i>

15:48.403 --> 15:50.757
<i>Work ruined everything, Ari!</i>

15:51.867 --> 15:55.019
I will come back to you
when Tom comes back to me!

15:55.088 --> 15:56.331
Okay? Goodbye!

16:07.092 --> 16:08.437
I just wanna do the paddle.

16:08.876 --> 16:10.609
Oh ho, no. you're not in.

16:10.815 --> 16:12.366
So I'm raising the paddle.

16:13.154 --> 16:14.757
You're a real dick, you know that?

16:15.087 --> 16:17.595
And now, for our featured
auction item of the day:

16:17.802 --> 16:22.291
lot 235...
a 1966 Sandy Koufax

16:22.592 --> 16:24.041
home flannel jersey.

16:27.842 --> 16:29.963
- Where the hell's Ronnie?
- Here he is, move over.

16:30.423 --> 16:31.820
Shows nice game use,

16:31.923 --> 16:33.268
no alterations of any kind.

16:33.372 --> 16:35.337
It's from Sandy's third cy young season.

16:35.466 --> 16:37.826
- Where the hell you been?
- On the phone with my father.

16:37.846 --> 16:39.969
My brother ratted me out,
told him what I was doing.

16:40.047 --> 16:42.141
- How'd he take it?
- He's heartbroken, the prick.

16:42.368 --> 16:43.445
Yeah, I'm with him.

16:43.497 --> 16:45.980
You could still get out,
Ronnie, save your soul.

16:46.740 --> 16:49.869
As many of you know, Sandy was supposed
to be here to sign some autographs,

16:49.947 --> 16:51.757
but sadly,
he was unable to make the trip.

16:52.067 --> 16:55.610
Anyway,
let the bidding begin at $20,000.

16:55.815 --> 16:57.472
- I have $20,000...
- Fuck it, I'm in,.

16:57.664 --> 16:58.879
- Do I have 21?
- Really?

16:58.957 --> 17:01.439
- Since the news is official.
- Do I hear 22?

17:01.543 --> 17:03.819
22.
Do I have 24?

17:04.089 --> 17:06.502
24. Do I have 25?
25?

17:07.108 --> 17:08.246
25!

17:08.867 --> 17:11.634
Do we have 28? 28!
Do we have 31?

17:12.521 --> 17:13.529
31!

17:13.580 --> 17:15.184
31. Do I hear 35?

17:15.262 --> 17:18.133
Give me $35,000!
$35,000!

17:18.236 --> 17:20.797
Give me 40!
Give me $40,000!

17:20.895 --> 17:22.162
- Do we have 40?
- 40.

17:22.266 --> 17:25.111
- 40! Do we have $42,000?
- I'm sorry, I can't do this.

17:25.223 --> 17:26.387
Why why why?

17:26.470 --> 17:28.979
I can't do this to my father.
I can't do this to Sandy.

17:29.231 --> 17:30.808
- I got $43,000!
- I'm sorry!

17:34.065 --> 17:35.643
What the fuck
we supposed to do now?

17:36.031 --> 17:37.893
Don't worry about it.
I'll cover his share.

17:38.100 --> 17:41.303
- 45!
- $45,000 right there! Do I have 48?

17:41.364 --> 17:44.229
Billy, are you sure you can have
a shootable script done in six weeks?

17:44.296 --> 17:46.398
No doubt.
I came up with the first act

17:46.465 --> 17:48.285
while I was stinking up
the skirt's bathroom.

17:48.337 --> 17:49.785
Just promise me you won't take a job

17:49.863 --> 17:51.337
- that could interfere.
- I promise.

17:51.441 --> 17:52.721
Beautiful.

17:53.937 --> 17:56.394
- Billy, nice car!
- Yeah, it's my girl's father's.

17:57.109 --> 17:59.310
You're not the only one
mooching luxury items

17:59.378 --> 18:01.262
off somebody, suit! Later!

18:01.714 --> 18:02.847
Late!

18:04.161 --> 18:05.325
What's up?

18:05.390 --> 18:07.201
You haven't said a word
in like half an hour.

18:07.253 --> 18:09.399
How could I say a word?
He doesn't shut the fuck up.

18:09.488 --> 18:12.130
- You know he likes to talk.
- I can't do this, Vince.

18:12.234 --> 18:14.018
- Do what?
- This movie, not with him.

18:14.136 --> 18:16.024
You got the apology.
What more do you want?

18:16.075 --> 18:18.015
I want to get along
with the people I work with.

18:18.067 --> 18:20.508
Life's too short to spend
another year being fucking abused

18:20.585 --> 18:22.939
- and you should respect that.
- I respect it, I do.

18:23.758 --> 18:25.258
But what now?

18:32.081 --> 18:33.089
Excuse me, hey.

18:33.166 --> 18:34.744
I'm wondering
if you know where Tom is?

18:35.029 --> 18:36.141
I am tom.

18:36.323 --> 18:37.772
- You're Tom?
- Yes.

18:38.251 --> 18:41.484
- Lloyd's Tom?
- I used to be.

18:41.937 --> 18:43.281
- Who are you?
- I don't get it.

18:43.359 --> 18:45.299
You're a good looking guy.
You can get girls.

18:45.649 --> 18:47.537
- How'd you know?
- Well, it's just a sketch,

18:47.615 --> 18:50.046
but Lloyd uses
your face as a dartboard.

18:50.434 --> 18:52.244
- Really?
- He's a really good artist.

18:53.690 --> 18:55.138
Can I talk to you for a second?

18:55.331 --> 18:56.442
Yeah, over here.

18:56.573 --> 18:58.486
Look, I'm already
on finish line probation,

18:58.564 --> 19:00.064
so I gotta make myself look busy.

19:00.142 --> 19:01.797
What are you, seven and a half, eight?

19:01.874 --> 19:03.119
- 11, tom?
- Really?

19:05.495 --> 19:08.947
- So, did he send you down here?
- No, I came down here on my own.

19:09.024 --> 19:11.818
I heard a lot about your problems
with Lloyd... That he's never home,

19:11.947 --> 19:13.539
that he's too career-oriented.

19:13.668 --> 19:15.875
- You gonna tell me he's not?
- No no. He is, he is.

19:15.953 --> 19:17.711
But let me ask you
something though, man:

19:17.841 --> 19:21.014
do you want a guy who's gonna
provide a great home for you,

19:21.091 --> 19:24.091
or some cooz who's on the couch
every day watching Oprah at 4:00?

19:24.169 --> 19:25.667
Oprah's on at 3:00, Ari.

19:26.366 --> 19:29.702
And, look... Yeah, I do hate
Lloyd's hours. Take a seat.

19:29.986 --> 19:31.878
But, you know, I'm a guy.

19:32.007 --> 19:33.507
I understand career goals.

19:35.137 --> 19:36.305
So, what's the problem?

19:36.382 --> 19:38.865
The problem is he couldn't
keep his dick in his pants.

19:40.240 --> 19:42.995
- He cheated on me.
- No... Lloyd cheated on you?

19:43.073 --> 19:45.064
No, he didn't, he would never...
Are you serious?

19:45.116 --> 19:46.693
Yeah, it's true.
I caught him.

19:47.055 --> 19:48.497
In the act?
Like, he was...

19:48.575 --> 19:50.204
No, I didn't catch him in the act,

19:50.282 --> 19:52.583
but, you know, I was
suspicious Friday night.

19:52.661 --> 19:54.221
He said he was going down to the Abbey.

19:54.324 --> 19:56.290
I parked my car out front.
He never showed.

19:56.751 --> 19:58.562
Never. I confronted him and, you know,

19:58.639 --> 20:01.215
he said that he didn't want
to be interrogated like that.

20:01.781 --> 20:03.850
Lloyd... Lloyd was with me Friday night.

20:04.405 --> 20:05.879
- He was with you?
- Yes.

20:05.983 --> 20:08.122
At "the Bourne Ultimatum" premiere.

20:08.277 --> 20:10.346
- Until like 2:00 a.m.!
- That is bullshit!

20:10.423 --> 20:11.716
No no no!
You know what?

20:11.768 --> 20:14.804
I think I even have
a picture of it in my phone.

20:14.947 --> 20:16.912
- Why wouldn't he tell me that?
- He told me

20:17.042 --> 20:19.628
that if he told you that he was
working on another friday night,

20:19.757 --> 20:22.174
that you would tell him
that it was over.

20:22.743 --> 20:24.088
You tell him that?

20:24.294 --> 20:26.966
Oh my gosh!
I mean... Maybe I did...

20:27.095 --> 20:28.595
You did.
You did.

20:29.196 --> 20:31.550
Lloyd is the best guy I know.
He would never cheat on you.

20:32.896 --> 20:34.473
Oh, man. I feel awful.

20:35.273 --> 20:37.161
- You cheated on Tom?!
- What?

20:37.265 --> 20:39.178
<i>You little fuckin' slut, Lloyd!</i>

20:39.256 --> 20:40.846
I don't know what you're talking about.

20:40.923 --> 20:42.210
I just saw Tom.

20:43.302 --> 20:45.086
- He came to the office?
- I went to his.

20:45.164 --> 20:46.793
He told me what you did.

20:49.056 --> 20:51.937
I couldn't help it, Ari!
It's been all the pressure.

20:52.248 --> 20:54.472
And I met this cute barista
at the coffee bean

20:54.653 --> 20:57.337
who I never thought would like me.
But he did like me, he did.

20:57.485 --> 21:00.045
<i>It was a one-time thing.
I go to Starbucks now.</i>

21:00.186 --> 21:01.996
<i>But I ruined everything.</i>

21:02.267 --> 21:04.776
No, you didn't ruin everything,
'cause I saved it.

21:05.064 --> 21:06.447
Saved it?
What do you mean?

21:06.576 --> 21:09.440
<i>You were with me Friday night
at The Bourne Ultimatum premiere.</i>

21:09.530 --> 21:10.563
I was?

21:10.616 --> 21:12.961
Get your ass back to the office
within the hour

21:13.013 --> 21:14.513
and I will stick to that story.

21:14.591 --> 21:15.780
Let me tell you something:

21:15.884 --> 21:17.921
I love a liar, but I hate a cheater.

21:18.231 --> 21:19.301
<i>- See ya!
- Wait!</i>

21:19.851 --> 21:21.300
I can't believe you did this for me.

21:21.326 --> 21:22.786
I like you. What can I say?

21:22.863 --> 21:24.854
Say you'll let me take
you and the wife to dinner

21:24.906 --> 21:27.304
- with tom, a couples dinner.
- I don't like you that much.

21:27.329 --> 21:28.855
Get your ass back to the office

21:28.933 --> 21:31.421
and get that fuckin' dartboard
down off your wall!

21:36.220 --> 21:38.987
$62,000. This was supposed
to go for no more than 50.

21:39.220 --> 21:42.401
What's the difference? It'll cut
into our profit margin a bit is all.

21:42.868 --> 21:44.368
Ah, the Koufax bidders.

21:44.670 --> 21:46.377
- That's us.
- You guys big fans?

21:46.480 --> 21:48.450
- Oh, die-hards.
- We're New Yorkers.

21:48.579 --> 21:50.778
Sandy would've been really
pleased to meet you guys.

21:50.881 --> 21:52.433
Such a shame he
couldn't get out here.

21:52.562 --> 21:54.139
Yeah, it would've been a great thrill.

21:54.242 --> 21:56.648
Sad, really.
Hasn't left his house in a month.

21:57.272 --> 21:58.824
Oh, no. Is everything okay?

21:58.949 --> 22:01.225
We'd be devastated
if something happened to Sandy.

22:01.520 --> 22:03.535
Sandy's as well as can be expected.

22:03.820 --> 22:05.371
His dog's been sick for months.

22:05.625 --> 22:08.082
He did everything he could,
but he finally succumbed.

22:08.255 --> 22:09.393
His dog?

22:09.584 --> 22:11.757
His beloved giant schnauzer, pee wee.

22:12.249 --> 22:14.318
Made it to 19.
That's pretty good for a dog.

22:14.943 --> 22:16.498
But you know what?
Next month,

22:16.990 --> 22:19.163
Sandy's gonna be out here
for the celebrity pro-am.

22:19.291 --> 22:21.360
He's favored as usual...
healthy as a clam.

22:21.736 --> 22:23.339
Maybe you guys can catch him then.

22:24.276 --> 22:25.433
Maybe.

22:28.388 --> 22:30.147
I'm gonna kill your cousin.

22:31.837 --> 22:33.001
Kill him.

22:36.456 --> 22:38.432
<i>Tom, you know
I saw and loved Dreamgirls</i>

22:38.509 --> 22:41.665
when it was in the theater, but I will
gladly watch it again with you tonight.

22:42.613 --> 22:43.958
I saw it with my mother.

22:45.791 --> 22:48.028
- Just tell us what our options are.
- Well, let's see.

22:48.105 --> 22:49.847
We can all drink poison gatorade

22:49.924 --> 22:52.071
and hope that the next life
is better than this one.

22:52.174 --> 22:53.648
Come on, E. You drink first.

22:54.379 --> 22:57.172
Vince, you really want
to throw away a go movie?

22:58.492 --> 23:00.690
E, it's your job to help him

23:00.813 --> 23:03.394
to get the movies that he wants,
not to fuck them up!

23:03.471 --> 23:05.799
You know he's helped me get
everything I've ever wanted.

23:05.877 --> 23:09.098
Come on, all right. So, you don't
like it when people talk down to you.

23:09.201 --> 23:10.727
People talk down to me every day.

23:10.805 --> 23:12.997
If I let go of all my clients
that talk down to me,

23:13.100 --> 23:14.652
he'd be the only one I had left.

23:15.040 --> 23:17.973
I mean, Jesus, man,
after all he's done for you,

23:18.130 --> 23:21.067
swallow your pride
and take one for the team.

23:21.657 --> 23:24.569
- Tell him that you wanna do this movie.
- He knows I wanna do the movie.

23:24.637 --> 23:25.942
And he knows that I don't.

23:26.097 --> 23:27.629
Look, I shouldn't be producing anyway.

23:27.732 --> 23:29.618
You wanna do this movie?
I'll sit this one out.

23:29.721 --> 23:30.847
Here comes the Irish guilt.

23:30.924 --> 23:32.370
There's no guilt.
The truth is,

23:32.473 --> 23:34.271
I don't like standing
around on sets anyway.

23:34.380 --> 23:35.637
That's not why I came out here.

23:35.740 --> 23:38.068
I'll go back to managing
and find the next project.

23:38.284 --> 23:39.723
Boom! Problem solved.

23:39.952 --> 23:41.452
He goes back to being a manager,

23:41.654 --> 23:43.638
I get him paid as a producer anyway.

23:44.234 --> 23:45.967
Lottery strikes again for you, E.

23:46.182 --> 23:47.242
Are you sure about this?

23:47.320 --> 23:49.273
And as your manager,
I'm sure of something else.

23:49.350 --> 23:51.567
- Oh, yeah? What?
- You shouldn't be doing this movie,

23:51.619 --> 23:53.164
- not with Billy.
- Jesus, fuck.

23:53.270 --> 23:55.742
And it's not my pride.
It's because I think Walsh has peaked.

23:55.794 --> 23:57.656
And I think
his best days are behind him.

23:58.273 --> 23:59.671
<i>And I think he fucked up Medellin.</i>

23:59.722 --> 24:01.729
- You know I don't agree with you.
- Nor do I.

24:01.807 --> 24:04.134
- You haven't seen it.
- I'm against you either way.

24:05.378 --> 24:07.757
- It's your choice, Vince.
- It is your choice.

24:07.912 --> 24:11.222
It's your life. He's just a passenger
lucky to have a seat.

24:13.094 --> 24:14.310
I'm gonna do the movie.

24:14.998 --> 24:18.489
There you go!
I'll have a $2 million advance check

24:18.696 --> 24:21.231
cut for you today!
How horrible!

24:22.305 --> 24:25.092
Bring in some bubbly!
We're doing a little celebrating.

24:26.463 --> 24:29.010
- Are you sure about this?
- Yeah. I just wanted to be heard.

24:29.564 --> 24:31.438
- Well, you weew.
- Yeah, I guess I was.
