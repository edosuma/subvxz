00:04.120 --> 00:06.070
- No!
- I will always love you, Melinda.

00:06.080 --> 00:07.610
Not you.

00:07.620 --> 00:08.670
You have to cross over.

00:08.710 --> 00:10.900
I don't want to.

00:14.460 --> 00:16.020
Jim, no!

00:17.170 --> 00:18.470
You're back.

00:18.480 --> 00:19.330
Do I know you?

00:19.360 --> 00:22.740
I see the same guy that you
see-- different hair, nose, eyes.

00:22.770 --> 00:23.740
It's not Jim.

00:23.780 --> 00:28.180
I just know what I see when I look in
those eyes, and Jim is in there somewhere.

00:28.190 --> 00:30.860
Wait. You're not gonna tell me you
think I'm your husband reincarnated,

00:30.870 --> 00:33.580
Because you're the only sane
person I've met since I woke up.

00:33.600 --> 00:35.030
I bought that less than a month ago.

00:35.070 --> 00:39.270
"Nicole, I know you're mad.

00:39.280 --> 00:40.890
Do you know how lucky you are?

00:40.900 --> 00:44.210
You are gonna get a second
shot at your one true love.

00:44.240 --> 00:45.880
Seems like you've had a
lot on your mind lately.

00:45.900 --> 00:50.310
Yeah. I mean, there's just a lot of stuff that doesn't
fit-- shoulder pain, the weird, violent memories.

00:50.320 --> 00:51.690
You know, I'm gonna do what you told me.

00:51.710 --> 00:53.920
- I'm gonna find somebody who understands.
- Like?

00:53.930 --> 00:56.240
Nicole. You know, who
would know me better?

00:56.250 --> 00:58.380
That's a good question.

01:00.680 --> 01:05.790
Ok, I have silverware, candlesticks.

01:05.800 --> 01:07.170
What about the china?

01:07.190 --> 01:08.240
Is it too middle-aged?

01:08.260 --> 01:09.630
It's perfect. Why are you so nervous?

01:09.640 --> 01:10.670
I'm not nervous.

01:10.690 --> 01:14.110
It's just been ages since I've
thrown a dinner party and--

01:14.120 --> 01:20.090
Twice that long since I've seen Marla and
Jody, so, ok, I guess I'm a little nervous.

01:20.590 --> 01:21.570
Here's a thought.

01:21.610 --> 01:25.270
You could just cancel or go
out, you know, without me.

01:25.280 --> 01:27.630
It's one dinner party.

01:27.660 --> 01:31.200
Besides, you and Eli are
gonna have a ball mocking me.

01:31.230 --> 01:34.340
Yeah, Friday night with mom and her
high school theater geek friends.

01:34.360 --> 01:35.010
Good times.

01:35.020 --> 01:36.230
You invited Eli?

01:36.260 --> 01:38.400
Well, he makes a living
out of talking to strangers.

01:38.430 --> 01:39.800
Wish you would reconsider.

01:39.810 --> 01:41.460
Sorry. Told you. Plans.

01:41.470 --> 01:47.080
Tearing your hair out while Sam goes and visits
his fiancée in Raleigh does not constitute plans.

01:47.100 --> 01:49.740
Actually I'm going with him.

01:50.790 --> 01:53.100
You saw him remember
his paramedic skills.

01:53.110 --> 01:58.260
I mean, his memory' coming back, so now
he just needs a crash course in Jim Clancy.

01:58.270 --> 01:59.750
A crash course?

01:59.760 --> 02:01.820
Look, when I was
opening the shop--

02:03.600 --> 02:06.250
Jim and I used to
love taking road trips.

02:06.260 --> 02:09.449
We'd hit all the estate sales,
antique shops, listen to music,

02:09.479 --> 02:11.770
Play games, stop by our
favorite restaurants.

02:11.800 --> 02:15.490
So you think by recreating all
of that, it might jog something?

02:15.530 --> 02:17.310
Look, Sam thinks he should know Nicole,

02:17.330 --> 02:20.260
So he'll wanna believe whatever she
says, which'll only confuse him more.

02:20.290 --> 02:21.650
You could just tell him the truth.

02:21.670 --> 02:24.940
Yeah, I tried that once, and he
looked at me like I was completely nuts.

02:24.960 --> 02:30.480
I just have to get him to remember Jim, you
know, but gently, so he doesn't get scared away.

02:30.900 --> 02:32.890
The heating guys are
coming first thing tomorrow.

02:32.910 --> 02:34.780
Could you swing by the
house and let them in for me?

02:34.790 --> 02:35.730
Sure. What time?

02:35.740 --> 02:36.860
7 a.m.

02:36.880 --> 02:38.130
Maybe I should just cancel.

02:38.160 --> 02:39.470
No. I'll do it.

02:39.480 --> 02:40.490
Well, that's nice. Thanks.

02:40.500 --> 02:41.980
Oh, I get it.

02:42.000 --> 02:44.570
You're thinking maybe you
should spend the night, housesit,

02:44.580 --> 02:46.490
and be there in the morning
for the heating guys.

02:46.510 --> 02:51.180
Yeah, and I have an English lit paper due on
Monday, so I could use the peace and quiet.

02:51.210 --> 02:52.950
It would help me out.

02:53.640 --> 02:56.950
Fine. Fine. Abandon your own mother.

03:00.540 --> 03:04.380
So how did you talk
Sam into letting you go?

03:04.400 --> 03:07.030
Well, I haven't yet.

03:07.040 --> 03:10.700
But trust me. I have a foolproof plan.

03:11.170 --> 03:13.450
Wait, you--you bought a
garage full of furniture?

03:13.460 --> 03:15.460
Uh, antiques. I got 'em online.

03:15.470 --> 03:17.420
Now you're gonna drive
down to Raleigh, too?

03:17.440 --> 03:19.480
Uh, new hope, actually. It's
about an hour from there.

03:19.490 --> 03:21.330
Anyway, with the price
of gas, I just thought--

03:21.340 --> 03:23.430
aw, Melinda, I don't know.

03:23.440 --> 03:27.780
I mean, Nicole called me and left me a message
the day before the accident saying, Yeah,

03:27.790 --> 03:33.590
she'd meet me if I was serious about the proposal,
but I mean, now she must think I got cold feet.

03:33.610 --> 03:35.110
She won't return my calls.

03:35.120 --> 03:36.850
She's changed her cell phone number.

03:36.880 --> 03:39.260
I just don't know how she's
gonna react, and if you're there--

03:39.280 --> 03:43.930
Well, I could make myself scarce, you know, while you
guys are talking, if you need to reconnect, I mean.

03:43.940 --> 03:48.040
Melinda, I just owe her
an explanation, right?

03:48.550 --> 03:50.800
Maybe she could explain
some things for me.

03:50.810 --> 03:51.870
Like?

03:51.910 --> 03:54.910
You know, like how I got
all that medical knowledge.

03:54.920 --> 03:59.170
You know, if we do share the driving,
could get there early tomorrow morning,

03:59.180 --> 04:03.210
And I could just use the
change of scenery, so...

04:04.050 --> 04:06.550
You and me, a road trip?

04:10.920 --> 04:13.820
All right. What the heck, huh? Why not?

04:13.830 --> 04:15.230
But, um...

04:15.250 --> 04:19.120
Is all that stuff in the
garage gonna fit in my pickup

04:19.130 --> 04:21.680
probably not.

04:21.690 --> 04:24.330
Which is why I got us a truck.

04:24.950 --> 04:26.850
So you're cool if I just
stay for drinks, right?

04:26.880 --> 04:28.640
If you want me to beg, I'll beg.

04:28.660 --> 04:32.640
I doubt that I have anything in common with
these girls, and you--you can talk to anybody.

04:32.660 --> 04:34.540
Yeah, but usually I get paid for it.

04:34.850 --> 04:36.930
Well, I really should get goin'.

04:36.950 --> 04:38.540
Traitor.

04:39.620 --> 04:42.800
I got it, ok?

04:45.940 --> 04:47.570
Well, hello.

04:47.580 --> 04:50.320
Jode, you didn't tell me
Delia was seeing someone.

04:50.330 --> 04:52.220
I'm Marla, and this is Jody.

04:52.250 --> 04:53.290
I'm Eli.

04:53.330 --> 04:54.980
Delia and I are just
friends. We're not dating.

04:54.990 --> 04:56.110
But how 'bout you two ladies?

04:56.120 --> 04:58.400
Oh, we're not dating.

04:59.360 --> 05:00.570
Deally!

05:00.580 --> 05:03.590
Oh, my god! Look at you!

05:04.020 --> 05:06.110
I know.

05:06.120 --> 05:08.250
Oh, my god. You look beautiful.

05:08.260 --> 05:09.390
I see you've met Eli.

05:09.410 --> 05:10.470
Yes, we did.

05:10.510 --> 05:12.520
Oh, Eli, would you mind
opening one of these?

05:12.540 --> 05:14.550
- Sure, my pleasure.
- Thank you.

05:14.880 --> 05:16.210
And who is this?

05:16.240 --> 05:17.710
Ah, this is Ned, my son.

05:17.720 --> 05:21.110
He's actually going out, but he
wanted to stay and meet you guys.

05:21.130 --> 05:23.850
Oh, I wish you could
meet my daughter Carly.

05:23.890 --> 05:24.740
You'd like her.

05:24.760 --> 05:25.540
Maybe next time.

05:25.560 --> 05:26.710
Oh, god. It's official.

05:26.720 --> 05:29.560
We are now our parents' age
when we were in high school.

05:29.590 --> 05:31.550
This calls for alcohol.

05:31.570 --> 05:34.140
Well, it was nice to meet you. Have fun.

05:34.220 --> 05:35.560
- Ok.
- Bye.

05:36.360 --> 05:39.500
We've got 25 years of catching up to do.

05:41.260 --> 05:43.550
Logan, I already texted Dylan.

05:43.560 --> 05:45.920
I can't go out with you guys.

05:45.930 --> 05:49.860
B-because I'm
house-sitting and--

05:54.370 --> 05:56.560
Logan, hang on a sec.

06:02.340 --> 06:04.540
Hello?

06:05.760 --> 06:08.670
Whoever's there, Melinda isn't home.

06:09.410 --> 06:12.820
And since I can't see or
hear you, maybe you should--

06:17.190 --> 06:19.660
- Logan.
- Gotta call you back.

06:19.670 --> 06:20.750
What are you guys doin' here?

06:20.760 --> 06:24.590
You couldn't come to the party,
so we brought the party to you.

06:32.640 --> 06:34.320
wait. How much furniture did you buy?

06:34.330 --> 06:35.730
An entire estate sale.

06:35.750 --> 06:38.550
I didn't know how big
of a truck we needed.

06:38.560 --> 06:40.460
If you wanted something' smaller,
you should have called before.

06:40.470 --> 06:42.000
No, no, no, no. It's
fine. 'Cause you know what?

06:42.010 --> 06:45.920
We might go to other estate sales, maybe even
thrift shops. I mean, doesn't that sound like fun?

06:45.930 --> 06:47.990
Yeah. I mean, we are in
kind of a hurry, I mean.

06:48.000 --> 06:48.710
What is this stuff?

06:48.720 --> 06:50.250
Just in case we get bored on the road.

06:50.270 --> 06:52.590
- Come on. We'll put our bags in the back.
- Yeah.

07:00.330 --> 07:01.290
You ok?

07:01.300 --> 07:03.330
That is such a loud door.

07:03.340 --> 07:05.630
You can see me, can't you?

07:05.960 --> 07:07.340
You can!

07:07.350 --> 07:09.960
Thank god! Where are you people headed?

07:09.970 --> 07:12.280
- Raleigh.
- Gesundheit.

07:12.290 --> 07:14.230
I call shotgun.

<font color=#00FFFF>Ghost Whisperer 
S04E12</font>

07:50.560 --> 07:54.400
If you were in Nicole’s shoes, you'd
want an explanation, too, right?

07:54.410 --> 07:56.060
My name is Frank, Frank Whitaker.

07:56.080 --> 07:57.770
If you'll just talk to me.

07:57.800 --> 07:59.130
Not now.

07:59.150 --> 08:00.190
Why not now?

08:00.210 --> 08:03.830
She's probably angry as hell
that I flaked on her, again.

08:04.420 --> 08:07.530
Well, hopefully she'll understand.

08:08.690 --> 08:10.980
- You ok?
- Yeah. Just stretching.

08:10.990 --> 08:13.180
How 'bout some music for the road?

08:14.900 --> 08:18.230
Oh, this song, it was popular when we...

08:18.830 --> 08:21.880
I--sorry--moved
to Grandview.

08:21.900 --> 08:25.790
It was playing when I found the
vacant storefront on town square.

08:27.190 --> 08:30.160
Oh, I get it. You like him.

08:30.170 --> 08:32.679
What, are you married, divorced? What?

08:32.690 --> 08:35.280
Look, I'm not going anywhere, so if
you wanna get me out of your hair--

08:35.289 --> 08:38.630
uh, you know what? I just remembered there's
a phone call that I have to make, so...

08:38.640 --> 08:40.940
Oh, for cryin' out loud.

08:41.909 --> 08:45.460
Hey, Frank. It's Melinda.

08:45.470 --> 08:49.050
Got your voice mail, but it was a
little garbled, so what were you saying?

08:49.060 --> 08:50.080
Thank you.

08:50.100 --> 08:52.910
I rented this truck to haul
some stuff to a coin show.

08:52.930 --> 08:54.700
I'm a numismatist.

08:54.710 --> 08:59.220
Anyway, I was fixing a flat on the shoulder
outside charlotte when the jack gave away.

08:59.230 --> 09:00.490
Man, did that hurt.

09:00.500 --> 09:01.140
Ok, you know what?

09:01.170 --> 09:04.190
The reception's a little rough out here,
so if you could just get to the point.

09:04.210 --> 09:09.630
Ok, there's a 1943 copper penny
fell into a crack at the cargo door.

09:09.650 --> 09:11.500
It's worth a fortune.

09:11.520 --> 09:14.610
I--I been tryin' to pick it up
forever, but, hey, watch this.

09:15.880 --> 09:17.310
My wife could use the money.

09:17.330 --> 09:20.810
I need you to find that
penny and send it to her.

09:20.840 --> 09:24.330
June Whitaker on Allen wood in Raleigh.

09:24.350 --> 09:26.860
She's in the book.
Will you do that for me?

09:26.870 --> 09:29.060
Be happy to help.

09:29.070 --> 09:31.800
Ohh, thank you.

09:32.600 --> 09:35.980
Well, it's about damn time. Ciao.

09:43.190 --> 09:44.760
There weren't enough guys in drama,

09:44.790 --> 09:50.300
So we did some gender bending with
that--that one act by that French guy.

09:50.310 --> 09:51.310
Moliere.

09:51.320 --> 09:52.260
Yes!

09:52.280 --> 09:54.880
Thank god somebody has
a functioning memory.

09:54.920 --> 09:57.940
Anyway, Marla was playing
Valera, the male lover,

09:57.990 --> 10:01.690
And when she kissed
deally, the place went nuts.

10:01.710 --> 10:03.700
Oh, I could imagine.

10:03.740 --> 10:06.280
God, memory lane's
such a dead-end street.

10:06.310 --> 10:07.730
Let's party already.

10:07.760 --> 10:09.650
Eli, I'm so glad you stayed.

10:09.670 --> 10:11.170
Oh, wouldn't have missed it.

10:11.190 --> 10:12.460
Deally, more champagne?

10:12.500 --> 10:14.740
No, no, no. Just 2 is my limit.

10:14.750 --> 10:16.160
You know, motherhood and all.

10:16.180 --> 10:18.070
You never
know when--

10:19.290 --> 10:21.330
that's more like it.

10:21.340 --> 10:26.230
- Deal, d-did you just put
this on? - No. No, I didn't.

10:28.610 --> 10:31.240
Hey, watch it.

10:31.250 --> 10:33.660
This was playing at the wrap party.

10:33.690 --> 10:36.430
Yeah. That was the
night that, uh--

10:37.140 --> 10:39.210
excuse me.

10:40.120 --> 10:44.440
Hello. Yeah.
Hi, Mrs.--

10:45.900 --> 10:48.070
what?

10:52.630 --> 10:53.760
Who are all these people?

10:53.780 --> 10:56.560
Your party must have gone viral.

10:56.570 --> 10:59.310
- This isn't my party.
- Really?

10:59.790 --> 11:02.140
- Then whose is it?
- Mom.

11:03.850 --> 11:05.560
Ok, guys, party's over.

11:05.590 --> 11:07.140
Everybody can start cleaning up!

11:07.150 --> 11:09.800
And nobody is leaving
without a designated driver!

11:09.810 --> 11:12.940
- Mom, listen-- -
no, you listen to me.

11:12.950 --> 11:15.640
You wanna make some excuses,
you can save your breath.

11:15.650 --> 11:17.370
Now, get to work. You're
comin' home with me.

11:17.380 --> 11:19.860
- But this
isn'my-- - now!

11:20.870 --> 11:22.240
Let me just tell you what happened.

11:22.250 --> 11:24.190
No, I know exactly what happened.

11:24.220 --> 11:27.180
You violated my trust and Melinda's.

11:27.190 --> 11:30.260
I told Dylan that I couldn't go out tonight because
I was house-sitting, and then the next thing--

11:30.270 --> 11:32.070
You let them in!

11:32.100 --> 11:34.000
They brought alcohol.

11:34.030 --> 11:35.970
- Were you drinking?
- No.

11:35.980 --> 11:37.830
Will you just chill for a second?

11:37.840 --> 11:41.680
Chill? Come back here,
I'm talking to you.

11:41.690 --> 11:44.420
Please shut up.

11:44.680 --> 11:46.420
Don't be slamming doors!

11:46.440 --> 11:48.900
- I didn't.
- I did.

11:48.910 --> 11:52.060
Stop, ok. Just stop.

11:52.340 --> 11:56.460
You need to go to bed, and I need to
think clearly about your punishment.

11:56.470 --> 11:59.570
Delia Rayburn, the party animal?

11:59.580 --> 12:01.770
No way.

12:08.900 --> 12:11.590
Oh, my god.

12:13.560 --> 12:15.830
How are you?

12:46.720 --> 12:49.090
That was quick. Is that her?

12:49.570 --> 12:52.970
No, her roommate, uh, Cheryl.

12:53.270 --> 12:55.660
Uh, Nicole took off 2 days
after I never showed up,

12:55.670 --> 12:59.940
and then she made Cheryl promise
she'd never tell me where she was.

12:59.950 --> 13:04.350
I'm sorry. So it's a dead end.

13:04.360 --> 13:05.920
Not exactly.

13:05.930 --> 13:08.760
Cheryl gave me Nicole’s new number.

13:09.920 --> 13:12.850
I didn't wanna do this over the phone.

13:16.790 --> 13:19.210
- hey, it's me. Leave a message.
- Voice mail.

13:19.560 --> 13:21.570
Nicole, hi. It's Sam.

13:21.580 --> 13:28.000
I'm really sorry I never explained to
you why I didn't show up, and I just--

13:28.020 --> 13:30.930
I had this accident, and my
life's been messed up ever since.

13:30.970 --> 13:34.700
Uh, I just would really like a
chance to explain what happened.

13:35.120 --> 13:38.460
Well, I hope to hear from you. Bye.

13:44.290 --> 13:45.570
Hey, you're not
goin' anywhere until--

13:45.580 --> 13:47.280
Melinda's heater guy, remember.

13:47.300 --> 13:49.330
Well, I want you home
right after so we can talk.

13:49.340 --> 13:51.410
Whatever.

14:03.900 --> 14:06.890
Brightness.

14:18.690 --> 14:21.710
When did you get so... Old?

14:27.600 --> 14:31.370
Um, is somebody here?

14:32.730 --> 14:34.030
God.

14:34.040 --> 14:35.770
Come on, doobie-ah.

14:35.800 --> 14:38.310
You know, loosen up a little.

14:38.320 --> 14:40.580
Have some fun.

14:46.280 --> 14:48.730
That'll work.

14:50.270 --> 14:52.090
Ok, where's the ghost?

14:52.120 --> 14:54.650
Uh, this is me you're talking to.

14:54.670 --> 14:56.740
Sorry. I'm not a morning person.

14:56.750 --> 14:58.980
Well, it's in here somewhere.

14:59.000 --> 15:00.730
Well, I believe "it's" a she.

15:00.770 --> 15:02.350
I heard her talking
at dinner last night.

15:02.380 --> 15:04.210
Teenager, kind of snarky.

15:04.230 --> 15:07.420
Well, do you think Ned brought
home some rand ghost girl?

15:07.450 --> 15:11.130
No. I believe she came with your
friends, looking for a party.

15:11.140 --> 15:12.860
Uh, hello?

15:12.890 --> 15:17.420
Whoever you are, I can hear
you, maybe even help you.

15:19.260 --> 15:21.480
Well, if she's here, she's not talkin'.

15:21.490 --> 15:22.770
Oh, my god.

15:22.780 --> 15:25.510
That song that played last night.

15:25.530 --> 15:28.730
Angie Hollenbeck.

15:28.740 --> 15:31.010
She was a girl that we
went to high school with.

15:31.040 --> 15:32.310
I had drama class with her.

15:32.320 --> 15:34.490
She loved to party so...

15:34.510 --> 15:37.090
If it really is Angie, you
gotta help me get rid of her.

15:37.120 --> 15:41.870
That girl was nothing but trouble, just always
wasted, and if she's hangin' around Ned--

15:41.890 --> 15:43.090
How'd she die?

15:43.120 --> 15:48.140
Uh, she got really messed up on
our senior wrap night, and, uh,

15:48.160 --> 15:52.690
She decided to walk home, and then the next
day, we heard that she got hit by a car.

15:53.120 --> 15:57.680
Anyway, that is not the
only reason why I called you.

15:58.310 --> 15:59.990
No, thanks. Makes me paranoid.

16:00.000 --> 16:03.710
No. I-- I found this
here. I know my son.

16:03.720 --> 16:09.660
And this is not like him, and Angie the pothead
just happened to show up at my house the night

16:09.670 --> 16:11.710
Before I find drugs in it.

16:11.720 --> 16:16.030
Oh, sure. Blame me. You suck!

16:18.320 --> 16:21.890
Kids today. Kids yesterday.

16:21.900 --> 16:25.290
This is nuts. You are a therapist.

16:25.300 --> 16:29.450
Ghost or no ghost, how--how am I
supposed to confront Ned about this?

16:29.480 --> 16:33.490
First of all, I wouldn't confront
anyone until I was sure it was his.

16:33.500 --> 16:36.260
What? You had the banger
sisters over here last night.

16:36.530 --> 16:39.780
What makes you think they didn't
bring the ghost and the ganja?

16:45.530 --> 16:47.890
Find something?

16:48.890 --> 16:50.700
See a penny, pick it up.

16:50.710 --> 16:52.810
That's old. That could
be worth something'.

16:52.820 --> 16:58.740
Yeah. I have a--a friend who's a collector,
so whenever I find anything, I send it to her.

16:59.700 --> 17:01.710
You for real?

17:05.390 --> 17:07.880
It's a lot of stuff.

17:12.829 --> 17:16.150
It's Nicole.
I should, uh--

17:16.680 --> 17:18.690
Yeah, thanks for callin' me back.

17:18.700 --> 17:19.710
Nah, I know. I know.

17:19.720 --> 17:23.089
I really owe you an explanation, but
this is gonna sound completely crazy.

17:23.119 --> 17:26.650
Look, I was in an accident
on my bike-- uh, motorcycle...

17:27.550 --> 17:29.750
Put that down.

17:33.280 --> 17:36.140
- Anything at all.
- Sorry.

17:36.150 --> 17:38.830
You know what? I’ll find a really
nice place for your things--

17:38.840 --> 17:40.640
but you should go into the light.

17:40.650 --> 17:46.820
On her deathbed I'd be buried with
her brooch, and my sister--heh.

17:47.120 --> 17:49.630
My senile sister forgot.

17:49.640 --> 17:52.670
I'm sorry about that.

17:53.010 --> 17:54.560
But if you've
already been buried--

17:54.570 --> 17:59.150
my funeral's tomorrow,
silly. I’m at Callaway mortuary.

17:59.160 --> 18:01.080
Open casket.

18:01.090 --> 18:04.320
And that, um-- the
little treble clef.

18:04.330 --> 18:07.020
Yes, thank you, dear.

18:08.020 --> 18:11.560
but you're the only person
truly who can help me remem--

18:11.860 --> 18:14.330
yeah.

18:17.720 --> 18:20.760
Ok. You, too.

18:21.850 --> 18:23.720
So how did that go?

18:23.740 --> 18:26.280
She told me to have a nice life.

18:26.820 --> 18:28.200
That's cold.

18:28.230 --> 18:29.980
I don't know. I wouldn't blame her.

18:29.990 --> 18:31.970
Why should she believe me?

18:31.990 --> 18:33.400
I'm sorry.

18:33.420 --> 18:36.720
Well, I should get the truck
loaded. It's a-- it's a long drive.

18:41.000 --> 18:43.490
Ok. I'm so sorry to bother you.

18:43.500 --> 18:46.090
Yeah, it was, uh, great
seeing you, too. I'll call you.

18:46.100 --> 18:50.440
No, I promise. Really. Ok. Bye.

18:53.150 --> 18:58.970
Marla and Jody both said no, so
that leaves Ned-- my worst nightmare.

18:59.380 --> 19:03.140
So if it is Ned's, any chance Angie would
have led you to that joint on purpose?

19:03.160 --> 19:05.670
Well, if she did, she
did it to stir up trouble.

19:05.690 --> 19:07.080
That was her specialty.

19:07.100 --> 19:11.280
She might just be a nuisance ghost, or
she's stuck in some juvenile defiance thing

19:11.310 --> 19:13.190
And acting out through Ned,

19:13.210 --> 19:18.400
or she was thinking you may be
a little more shall we say...

19:19.260 --> 19:20.330
Simpatico.

19:20.380 --> 19:22.040
Where did you get my yearbook?

19:22.050 --> 19:23.450
At your house this morning.

19:23.480 --> 19:26.260
I've been reading what people wrote
to you, and from what I can gather,

19:26.610 --> 19:30.020
it sounds like Angie wasn't the
only one who liked to par-tay.

19:30.030 --> 19:33.240
Yeah. Well, one of us grew out of it.

19:33.250 --> 19:35.180
And the other one died.

19:35.220 --> 19:39.530
All the more reason I don't want Ned
to make the same mistakes that I did.

19:39.560 --> 19:42.290
Then you need to have a sit-down,
get him to open up about it.

19:42.330 --> 19:42.960
Easier
said--

19:42.980 --> 19:47.000
Delia, if you get involved with
this now, you can nip it in the bud.

19:47.640 --> 19:49.740
So to speak.

19:52.150 --> 19:53.640
Why would I lie about amnesia?

19:53.660 --> 19:56.430
I mean, who even gets amnesia?

19:56.470 --> 19:58.170
It happens obviously.

19:58.180 --> 20:02.490
Here I am goin' on about things when you're tryin'
to pay respects to your mother's friend and--

20:02.500 --> 20:06.360
no, it'ok. I hardly know...

20:07.040 --> 20:08.780
Myrna very well.

20:08.790 --> 20:12.460
Um, my mom just told me that she
died and asked me to stop by, so...

20:12.480 --> 20:13.680
You didn't know her very well?

20:13.710 --> 20:17.390
Wh-why do you keep doin' these
random nice little things for people?

20:17.420 --> 20:19.410
I mean like this, and
you mailed that penny--

20:19.420 --> 20:22.720
karma. You know, do unto
others, that whole thing.

20:22.740 --> 20:24.790
Oh, yeah? Well, what
would you do in my shoes?

20:24.800 --> 20:28.240
Oh, that's--
that's hard to say.

20:28.270 --> 20:29.600
I don't believe you.

20:29.630 --> 20:33.700
I think if you left somebody hanging, you'd
wanna go see them face to face, wouldn't you?

20:35.140 --> 20:36.300
So that's what I'm gonna do.

20:36.320 --> 20:39.690
Ok.Ok,
but--

20:39.700 --> 20:43.970
but first, I'm starving, and I
know this great ace near here.

20:44.000 --> 20:46.590
Do you-- do you
like Mexican?

20:46.620 --> 20:47.680
I don't remember.

20:47.710 --> 20:49.270
Something tells me you're gonna love it.

20:49.280 --> 20:53.460
So, um, just--just wait
for me in the truck, and--

20:53.470 --> 20:55.560
yeah.

21:02.920 --> 21:05.520
They did a lovely job, didn't they?

21:05.530 --> 21:07.920
Except for that hair.

21:07.930 --> 21:10.620
Here you go.

21:13.310 --> 21:15.920
Do you see a light?

21:15.930 --> 21:19.380
I do now. Bless you.

21:30.950 --> 21:32.280
Is everything ok?

21:32.300 --> 21:35.220
Heating's fixed. Finished my paper.

21:35.600 --> 21:37.650
No parties.

21:37.660 --> 21:41.900
Great. So let's talk.

21:43.010 --> 21:44.460
Figured.

21:45.190 --> 21:48.550
Look, those kids just
showed up, I swear,

21:48.560 --> 21:51.170
And the next thing I knew,
it was out of control.

21:51.420 --> 21:54.040
Ok. I believe you about that.

21:54.660 --> 21:56.610
What does that mean?

21:56.880 --> 22:01.940
Look, you know you can talk
to me about anything, right?

22:01.950 --> 22:06.240
For example, if you're into any
kind of drugs, you can tell me.

22:06.250 --> 22:09.120
What? I'm not doing drugs.

22:09.370 --> 22:14.410
I know. Hypothetically, if you
were, you could come and talk to me.

22:14.420 --> 22:16.760
After the way you acted last night?

22:16.790 --> 22:18.990
Hypothetically, probably not.

22:19.000 --> 22:20.200
I was angry.

22:20.220 --> 22:21.840
Obviously you still are.

22:21.850 --> 22:24.950
Yes. Sometimes people make bad
choices just so they can fit in,

22:24.960 --> 22:27.170
And if your friends are
gettin' high or smokin' pot,

22:27.180 --> 22:28.630
You need to tell me about that.

22:28.650 --> 22:30.040
I'm not smoking anything.

22:30.050 --> 22:31.020
Really?

22:31.040 --> 22:33.560
Then why did I find
a joint in your room?

22:33.580 --> 22:35.970
It's so after-school special.

22:35.980 --> 22:37.060
Are you kidding me?

22:37.080 --> 22:38.510
Maybe one of your friends brought it.

22:38.540 --> 22:40.170
Well, they didn't.

22:40.190 --> 22:43.910
- If you would just be
honest-- - I am. It wasn't me.

22:53.180 --> 22:55.690
- Best sangria in the world...
- Yeah?

22:55.700 --> 22:58.890
- From my very limited experience.
- All right.

22:58.900 --> 23:01.240
Well? Was I right?

23:01.980 --> 23:05.470
Yeah. I mean, it's good.
It's nd of sweet, though.

23:05.480 --> 23:08.750
I'll probably end up drinkin'
beer with dinner. Sorry.

23:09.210 --> 23:14.530
Hey, I'm-- did I see you put something
in your mom's friend's casket?

23:15.370 --> 23:17.580
That. Yeah, it was a brooch.

23:17.590 --> 23:19.350
I--I guess the piece was
really important to her.

23:19.370 --> 23:21.500
So I am hungry. Are you hungry?

23:21.510 --> 23:23.830
Yeah. Yeah, I am hungry. I'm hungry.
You've been here before, right?

23:23.840 --> 23:26.370
- Several times.
- With Jim, huh?

23:26.380 --> 23:29.870
- Sorry. I keep doin' that.
- No, it's fine.

23:30.670 --> 23:34.720
Look, I know that Jim would want
me to be happy, and I will be,

23:34.760 --> 23:38.390
So in his honor, I just
keep moving forward.

23:38.810 --> 23:40.840
- All right.
- Great.

23:41.410 --> 23:43.390
World's greatest mole sauce.

23:43.400 --> 23:45.360
- Oh, yeah?Ok.Try it.
- Yeah.

23:50.400 --> 23:55.150
All right. You're right.
That is really--that's...

23:57.230 --> 24:00.080
Wait a minute. I've--
I've had this before.

24:00.090 --> 24:02.740
I've tasted this before more than once.

24:02.750 --> 24:05.850
I-I'm guessing that you have.

24:07.120 --> 24:10.850
- Are you ok?
- Yeah. It's just maybe a kind of a sensory overload.

24:10.860 --> 24:13.370
You know, the music, the food.

24:14.220 --> 24:16.520
Melinda, I've--I've
been here.

24:16.530 --> 24:17.370
Really?

24:17.380 --> 24:22.400
Uh, I mean, do you think
that-- you think you and I...

24:22.410 --> 24:24.050
Yes?

24:24.080 --> 24:26.780
Might have been here at the same time?

24:26.800 --> 24:32.810
You know, like, uh, me and Nicole and-- and you and
Jim sittin' at--I mean, that'd be a weird thing, huh?

24:32.820 --> 24:35.100
I mean, what a small world.

24:36.570 --> 24:39.260
Wh-what's wrong?

24:43.590 --> 24:48.840
Oh, no. I've gotta be allergic
to this. Excuse me. Sorry.

24:48.850 --> 24:52.480
Excuse me, does anyone
have antihistamines?

24:59.540 --> 25:02.910
<i>prty 2-nite</i>

25:09.380 --> 25:11.560
Mom.

25:19.160 --> 25:21.180
Hello?

25:47.510 --> 25:50.890

GRAHAM--</i>

26:09.820 --> 26:14.500
- Yeah.
- Hey, Delia, it's Marla. Look, about your call earlier...

26:18.040 --> 26:20.570
I don't--I
don't understand.

26:20.580 --> 26:23.450
Me llamo Drina. El se llama Cal.

26:23.460 --> 26:26.550
Por favor da le mensaje de mi parte?

26:27.180 --> 26:30.200
No hablo espaol.

26:30.450 --> 26:32.530
Drina. Drina.

26:34.060 --> 26:36.740
Cal. Cal.

26:38.860 --> 26:42.260
Um, excuse me. Your name
is-- your name is Cal, right?

26:42.270 --> 26:43.820
- Do I know you?
- No.

26:43.830 --> 26:47.650
No, I--I have a-- a
messe for you from Drina.

26:47.660 --> 26:49.620
- Drina?
- What about Drina?

26:49.630 --> 26:51.400
Su nueva novia...

26:51.410 --> 26:54.870
She says, "su nueva novia..."

26:54.880 --> 26:56.450
What?

26:56.460 --> 26:59.590
Es una perra callejera.

26:59.600 --> 27:03.640
Uh, "es una perra..." What?

27:03.650 --> 27:06.620
- Ahh, did she just...
- Callejera.

27:06.670 --> 27:08.700
Who does she think she is?

27:08.710 --> 27:11.740
You're saying my girlfriend
looks like a hooker?

27:11.750 --> 27:16.480
Oh, no.Uh,
Drina--

27:16.490 --> 27:19.930
Drina’s been dead for 2
years. Who the hell are you?

27:19.940 --> 27:23.500
Hey, hey, what's goin' on? There's
gotta be a misunderstanding, right?

27:23.510 --> 27:25.790
Oh, yeah. Let me clear it up.

27:29.430 --> 27:32.630
Hey, you know, there really
has been a misunderstanding.

27:34.110 --> 27:36.090
Hey, are you ok?

27:36.900 --> 27:38.480
Sam!

27:42.440 --> 27:44.010
Sam. Hey, are you ok?

27:44.020 --> 27:48.870
Yeah. You know, a couple stitches, a tetanus shot,
but, um, you know, you should see the other guy.

27:49.920 --> 27:52.040
Like, speaking of which,
what happened back there?

27:52.050 --> 27:55.020
Well, let's just say I won't be
using my high school Spanish again.

27:57.980 --> 28:01.340
- Do you smell that?
- What? Disinfectant?

28:01.350 --> 28:04.900
No, it just... Seems familiar.

28:09.990 --> 28:12.120
Try to open your eyes if you can.

28:17.640 --> 28:21.030
Sam? Sam.

28:21.040 --> 28:25.330
Uh, sorry. I just got a
little lightheaded there.

28:28.100 --> 28:30.560
Does your shoulder hurt?

28:30.570 --> 28:33.080
Yeah, like hell.

28:34.260 --> 28:36.600
I just had the weirdest memory.

28:37.390 --> 28:40.550
What? What did you remember?

28:40.560 --> 28:43.410
Something that's not possible.

28:43.420 --> 28:48.810
Look, this is gonna sound nuts,
but I think I remember getting shot.

28:58.100 --> 29:00.630
Dinner's almost--
where you going?

29:00.640 --> 29:01.640
Out.

29:01.650 --> 29:05.040
That cracking sound you hear
is the ice you're standing on.

29:05.580 --> 29:07.110
Relax. It's just a party.

29:07.120 --> 29:09.270
Are you forgetting what
happened last night?

29:09.290 --> 29:11.520
How could I? Am I grounded?

29:11.530 --> 29:13.250
You're this close.

29:13.260 --> 29:14.760
What is goin' on, Ned?

29:14.770 --> 29:16.440
Why don't you just talk to me?

29:16.460 --> 29:19.310
You wanna talk? Fine.

29:19.890 --> 29:21.790
Let's talk about this.

29:22.520 --> 29:24.810
- Yeah.
- Hey, Delia, it's Marla.

29:24.820 --> 29:27.790
Look, about your call earlier,
I'm pretty embarrassed.

29:27.810 --> 29:30.610
I was with my daughter, so
I sort of told a little fib.

29:30.640 --> 29:34.130
Anyway, yeah, the joint's
mine. I'm sorry. Just...

29:34.140 --> 29:37.270
You're mad at me about something that
wasn't even my fault when the whole time

29:37.300 --> 29:39.270
you were here getting
high with your friends.

29:39.300 --> 29:43.020
No, I wasn't, and I-I'm sorry
that I accused you, but--

29:43.040 --> 29:45.300
Mom, your friend Angie's here, too.

29:45.330 --> 29:48.330
She showed me your yearbook, so I don't think
you wanna be lecturing me about anything.

29:48.340 --> 29:53.280
Ned, Angie was always a troublemaker,
and she still is, and for some reason,

29:53.320 --> 29:55.180
She is trying to get
between the two of us.

29:55.220 --> 29:57.730
Your friends called you doobie-ah.

29:57.740 --> 30:01.200
You're all over me about something I'm
not even doing when obviously you did.

30:01.230 --> 30:02.710
Hey, this is not about me.

30:02.730 --> 30:03.940
So you're saying you did.

30:03.960 --> 30:05.390
No. I am
saying--

30:05.400 --> 30:07.490
now who's not being honest?

30:07.510 --> 30:08.720
Now who's grounded?

30:08.740 --> 30:12.710
Why don't you just go into your room until we
can have a rational conversation about this.

30:12.720 --> 30:15.190
Sounds like never to me.

30:18.200 --> 30:20.400
I know it must be painful, but it's...

30:20.410 --> 30:23.330
A good sign you're remembering.

30:23.360 --> 30:24.840
Yeah, but remembering what?

30:24.870 --> 30:30.630
Everything my family tells me, none of
this fits-- the emergency medical knowledge,

30:30.640 --> 30:34.670
The taste of food I'm
allergic to, getting shot.

30:36.050 --> 30:38.680
Melinda, I feel like I'm losing my mind.

30:38.690 --> 30:41.000
Or maybe you're finding it.

30:41.010 --> 30:42.700
I-it's possible.

30:42.720 --> 30:44.980
Maybe you're trying to
remember the wrong life.

30:45.610 --> 30:46.680
What do you mean?

30:46.720 --> 30:51.340
Well, you have this idea of who you are
based on what other people have told you,

30:51.350 --> 30:55.900
So that's the Sam that you're trying
to get back to but--but maybe just...

30:55.910 --> 31:00.090
Maybe there's this-- this whole
other person inside you entirely.

31:00.110 --> 31:04.260
Wait a minute. Eli talked about some
kind of regression back to a past life.

31:04.270 --> 31:06.490
- Is that what you mean?
- Maybe.

31:08.530 --> 31:10.940
If you just open your mind...

31:12.070 --> 31:15.620
And your heart, maybe
you'll find the key.

31:17.500 --> 31:21.570
You mean a key like a place...

31:22.010 --> 31:23.990
Or a person.

31:24.000 --> 31:26.140
Sure.

31:27.360 --> 31:30.840
Someone who's always been there for me,

31:31.360 --> 31:33.880
someone who knew me
better than anyone else.

31:34.720 --> 31:36.960
That's right.

31:40.700 --> 31:43.190
It's gotta be Nicole.

31:46.320 --> 31:48.770
******

31:49.380 --> 31:50.530
Nicole, hi. It's Sam.

31:50.540 --> 31:52.700
Look, I'm sorry I keep
leaving you these messages,

31:52.730 --> 31:58.930
But I mean, everything I told you about the
accident and my memory, please, it's all true.

31:59.320 --> 32:02.550
And I was hoping maybe
you would help me...

32:08.880 --> 32:14.100
Nicole, no, it's too much of a
burden to put on you to ask you to

32:14.110 --> 32:17.140
help me with all that after
what I put you through, so...

32:19.530 --> 32:24.400
If you need to move on, maybe--maybe
that's better for both of us.

32:26.680 --> 32:28.790
Be well.

32:41.530 --> 32:43.170
You're not answering your phone.

32:43.190 --> 32:46.680
I left my cell in the car.
Rry. Did you talk to Ned?

32:47.130 --> 32:49.730
More like yelled with.

32:49.760 --> 32:51.590
- So you got angry.
- I know. I know.

32:51.600 --> 32:53.530
We both did, and then he busted me.

32:53.540 --> 32:57.470
And thanks to Marla and Jody,
all of my credibility is gone.

32:58.290 --> 33:00.790
Parents don't have credibility.

33:00.810 --> 33:04.370
Hi, Angie. M Eli.

33:04.380 --> 33:06.520
Yeah, the shrink. I know.

33:06.530 --> 33:08.200
Nice to meet you, too.

33:08.230 --> 33:12.290
- Your parents tried counseling?
- Yeah. Look how well that turned out.

33:12.300 --> 33:14.100
Now Delia’s just like them.

33:14.110 --> 33:15.590
She says you're acting like her parents.

33:15.600 --> 33:17.080
Why does she care?

33:17.100 --> 33:20.660
Because you used to be so cool.

33:21.970 --> 33:25.860
She's hangin' around because she thought you
were cool, but now she thinks you're a hypocrite.

33:25.870 --> 33:27.010
Yes.

33:27.030 --> 33:31.510
I lied to my son, because I'm old
enough now to want to protect him,

33:31.530 --> 33:34.430
And if that means I'm a hard-ass,
then that's the way it's gonna be.

33:34.460 --> 33:36.930
You're just an ass.

33:36.940 --> 33:38.640
Oh, that was Angie. It wasn't me.

33:38.650 --> 33:41.540
- She says she thinks-- - I don't care
what you think, angie.I really don't.

33:41.550 --> 33:44.750
I just wanna protect my son
from ever ending up like you.

33:44.760 --> 33:47.160
Well, you can seriously go...

33:48.890 --> 33:50.190
What?

33:56.180 --> 34:00.350
Well, looks like somebody's gonna
miss the party of the century.

34:03.670 --> 34:06.480
Can't. Grounded.

34:06.490 --> 34:08.550
You're gonna let that stop you?

34:08.560 --> 34:11.739
Come on, man. Your mom's not even home.

34:22.840 --> 34:24.120
Hey, Angie?

34:24.150 --> 34:27.239
Come on. Life's short.

34:29.909 --> 34:32.460
Trust me on that.

34:44.409 --> 34:46.840
Hey, is this music too loud for you?

35:08.150 --> 35:10.150
Blondie?

35:11.150 --> 35:12.780
Well, at least he's got good taste.

35:12.790 --> 35:14.780
Yeah, I'm not so sure it's his.

35:14.790 --> 35:18.460
Ned! Honey, I'm comin' in.

35:24.260 --> 35:27.110
What kind of party is under a bridge?

35:39.610 --> 35:41.740
I think it's the next block up.

35:41.760 --> 35:44.380
You mean that place
with all the cop cars?

35:44.820 --> 35:47.590
My god.

36:08.380 --> 36:11.020
Excuse me. I am looking
for my son, Ned banks.

36:11.030 --> 36:13.120
Sorry, ma'am. You're gonna have
to come down to the precinct.

36:13.130 --> 36:14.280
Are you arresting everyone?

36:14.300 --> 36:17.110
Yes, ma'am. Drugs and alcohol.

36:17.120 --> 36:18.950
Where the hell is he?

36:18.960 --> 36:21.650
He went home. Wuss.

36:22.030 --> 36:23.630
He went home.

36:23.640 --> 36:25.350
What?

36:28.250 --> 36:31.660
I brought trivia cards
just to help pass the time.

36:31.670 --> 36:34.000
Trivia? With me?

36:35.300 --> 36:38.640
Right. Bad idea. Sorry.

36:41.730 --> 36:44.330
I hope I did the right thing here.

36:45.460 --> 36:47.800
The important thing is you tried.

36:48.130 --> 36:50.950
Well, with your help. Thank you.

36:51.420 --> 36:53.660
You do that, you know, not just with me.

36:53.680 --> 36:55.740
Yeah, random acts of kindness.

36:55.750 --> 36:57.430
Right.

36:58.470 --> 37:01.310
I gotta say you're kind of amazing.

37:03.750 --> 37:05.630
I mean, you're a little strange, too.

37:06.290 --> 37:10.020
So are you. Amazing.

37:10.410 --> 37:12.920
Amazing.
Not--not strange.

37:20.000 --> 37:23.050
Would it be wrong of me to want to...

37:24.010 --> 37:26.820
Run into a little traffic here?

37:28.420 --> 37:30.630
Why would you want that?

37:30.660 --> 37:33.320
Make the trip last a little bit longer.

37:38.650 --> 37:42.140
Do you have any idea how
much trouble you're in?

37:42.170 --> 37:44.100
No, but I'm sure you're
gonna tell me all about it.

37:44.110 --> 37:46.290
- Ok, let's all try to-- -
first of all, you're grounded.

37:46.320 --> 37:48.240
Second of all, you're grounded.

37:48.250 --> 37:51.090
Was it really worth it just
risking your life for some party?

37:51.100 --> 37:52.490
That's a little
dramatic, don't you think?

37:52.510 --> 37:53.750
I didn't really risk my life.

37:53.770 --> 37:55.030
Guys, if you'll
just let me--

37:55.050 --> 37:58.710
when we got there, the police were
arresting almost all of those kids,

37:58.740 --> 38:01.160
and 2 of them were taken
away in an ambulance.

38:01.180 --> 38:02.410
I left before they got there.

38:02.440 --> 38:05.220
You weren't supposed to
be there in the first place.

38:05.230 --> 38:08.550
Yeah, at least he's still alive, and I
would be, too, if it weren't for my parents.

38:08.560 --> 38:10.150
- I told you,
ne-- - wait.

38:10.160 --> 38:11.590
Angie's here.

38:11.620 --> 38:13.850
You know what? I have had it with her.

38:13.860 --> 38:15.880
Actually, I think you
may wanna hear this.

38:15.890 --> 38:19.250
Angie, what did you mean about
being dead because of your parents?

38:19.260 --> 38:22.780
I wasn't walking back home
the night I was killed.

38:22.790 --> 38:27.450
I was walking back to the
party to be with my friends.

38:27.470 --> 38:29.090
It's the only place I felt safe.

38:29.100 --> 38:30.850
You were walking back to the party.

38:30.870 --> 38:37.570
Yes, because by the time I'd
gotten home, I was 5 minutes late,

38:37.600 --> 38:42.760
5 stinking minutes late, and my
dad locked me out of the house.

38:42.800 --> 38:48.920
So I started walking back to the
party, and I was crying so hard...

38:49.980 --> 38:52.170
I didn't even hear that car.

38:52.190 --> 38:54.440
What is it? What's going on?

38:54.780 --> 38:57.350
She says her parents locked
her out of the house that night,

38:57.380 --> 38:59.330
Because she missed her
curfew by 5 minutes.

38:59.370 --> 39:00.980
They were that strict.

39:01.010 --> 39:02.970
That's hoible.

39:02.990 --> 39:05.700
I would never do that to Ned.

39:05.720 --> 39:10.680
She says you already have, locked
him out, because you're lying to him.

39:10.690 --> 39:14.300
And she wants to know how's he ever gonna learn from
your mistakes if you're not being honest with him?

39:14.310 --> 39:17.640
That's
not--

39:19.560 --> 39:23.070
ok.You're right.

39:23.080 --> 39:30.190
But you know, what happened to
you, I learned such a huge lesson.

39:30.890 --> 39:35.270
What I mean is a lot of
this is because of you.

39:36.060 --> 39:39.980
When Jody called me that morning
to tell me that you were dead,

39:40.830 --> 39:44.710
My whole life was completely changed.

39:45.470 --> 39:48.380
And when I finally stopped crying,

39:48.410 --> 39:54.500
I vowed that I would never let anything
like that happen to somebody I cared about.

39:57.580 --> 40:00.450
So I guess...

40:00.460 --> 40:06.120
I wouldn't be the mom I
am if I hadn't known you.

40:08.130 --> 40:11.390
And I wouldn't have a son like Ned.

40:12.430 --> 40:16.080
If my parents talked to me like that...

40:16.490 --> 40:19.420
It's never too late, even now.

40:19.430 --> 40:21.450
You can talk to them.

40:21.460 --> 40:24.200
That's genius, Einstein.

40:24.210 --> 40:25.450
I'm dead.

40:25.460 --> 40:27.700
That's what I'm here for.

40:27.710 --> 40:30.480
I already called them.

40:45.050 --> 40:48.950
Just so you know, when I got to
that party, I saw how crazy it was,

40:48.960 --> 40:51.370
so I turned around and came home.

40:51.380 --> 40:53.950
I'm proud of you, Ned.

40:54.440 --> 40:57.720
I'm not sure that's what I would
have done when I was your age.

40:59.400 --> 41:01.500
And I'm sorry for the way I acted.

41:01.510 --> 41:06.390
Good. Me, too.

41:07.680 --> 41:10.220
The truth is I'm always
gonna worry about you.

41:10.230 --> 41:13.640
And the drugs and the drinking,
I know they're all around,

41:13.660 --> 41:15.320
And its not that I don't
trust your judgment.

41:15.340 --> 41:19.460
It's just what happens to your judgment
the second you're drunk or getting high.

41:19.490 --> 41:22.730
Mom, I know.

41:23.680 --> 41:26.110
I'm sorry you lost your friend.

41:27.440 --> 41:29.650
Me, too.

41:39.260 --> 41:41.580
Thank you.

41:52.640 --> 41:56.550
I guess theirs nothin' like a road
trip to help you forget your past.

41:57.090 --> 42:00.230
I mean my past, not your
past. I'm sure yours is fine.

42:00.240 --> 42:02.200
No, I need to move forward, too.

42:02.210 --> 42:04.170
That's good to hear.

42:05.770 --> 42:08.670
Hey, uh, look, I know we just got here.

42:09.800 --> 42:13.610
But, um, you wanna go down
to the village? I don't know.

42:13.620 --> 42:16.500
We could go to a restaurant or, um...

42:16.760 --> 42:19.220
Hit a bookstore. The only bookstore.

42:19.230 --> 42:24.450
Uh, or we could just, you know, get a movie
and then have takeout, come back here, and...

42:25.090 --> 42:26.650
We could, uh...

42:26.680 --> 42:30.550
Go to a hardware store a-and
t some spackle and then...

42:30.570 --> 42:32.730
Spackle?

42:32.740 --> 42:36.150
You know, I think I've forgotten how
to do this along with everything else.

42:36.580 --> 42:38.970
Do what?

42:39.370 --> 42:41.710
Ask somebody out.

42:44.760 --> 42:47.870
- Is that what you're doing?
- Yeah.

42:48.340 --> 42:50.320
Sam!

42:56.640 --> 42:59.480
I got your message, and--and
then I spoke to Cheryl.

42:59.490 --> 43:01.890
I'm so sorry.

43:06.140 --> 43:09.380
Oh, my god. It's true. You
don't know who I am, do you?

43:09.860 --> 43:12.400
I'm sorry.

43:15.160 --> 43:17.690
You must be Nicole.

43:20.310 --> 43:22.870
Nikki. It's Nikki.
