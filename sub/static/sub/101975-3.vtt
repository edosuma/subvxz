10:00.508 --> 10:03.159
And filming a segment
highlighting Chastain's value

10:03.328 --> 10:05.662

Don't do anything crazy.

10:22.289 --> 10:25.624
And let's keep Red Rock's plans
to ourselves.

10:25.775 --> 10:28.251
The last thing we need to do
is panic the staff.

10:31.798 --> 10:34.090
Mm.

10:35.135 --> 10:36.693
Really?

10:36.862 --> 10:38.119
(chuckles)

10:38.287 --> 10:39.453
Come on.

10:39.622 --> 10:42.456
-Ready?
-Mm, no.

10:42.476 --> 10:44.059
Too bad.

10:45.203 --> 10:46.386
(winces)

10:46.538 --> 10:48.554
Mm, maybe I should've
married a nurse.

10:48.707 --> 10:50.223
(chuckles)

10:50.375 --> 10:51.708
Here.

10:51.801 --> 10:53.860
-I won't quit my day job.
-(moans)

10:58.008 --> 10:59.549
We'll know soon.

10:59.642 --> 11:02.243
Now all we do is wait.

11:04.480 --> 11:08.408
Hey, Doc, how long do I
have to be like this?

11:08.560 --> 11:12.061
Mr. McCloud,
your condition is critical.

11:12.155 --> 11:14.155
-We need to discuss it.
-(laughs)

11:14.323 --> 11:17.825
I know I look like a burrito,
but it can't be that bad.

11:17.994 --> 11:19.252
I can't even feel any pain.

11:19.421 --> 11:21.346
The fire destroyed
your pain receptors.

11:21.497 --> 11:25.499
And we're gonna give you fluids
to make you feel comfortable.

11:25.593 --> 11:28.812
-But that's all
we can offer you.
-Wait a minute.

11:29.672 --> 11:31.189
What are you telling me?

11:31.358 --> 11:34.734
(exhales)
You might not survive this.

11:36.012 --> 11:37.770
Is there someone we can call
to be with you?

11:37.923 --> 11:40.273
I saw that your daughter was on
your emergency contact list.

11:40.442 --> 11:42.200
No. No.

11:42.351 --> 11:44.703
I don't want Ariana
to remember me like this.

11:44.871 --> 11:46.279
You shouldn't be alone.

11:46.448 --> 11:47.780
And I'm sure that your daughter
wants to see you.

11:47.933 --> 11:51.358
My daughter and I... she...

11:51.527 --> 11:53.378
we don't talk much.

11:53.547 --> 11:56.923
There have been problems.

11:58.293 --> 12:01.127
When I was growing up,
my father was always

12:01.296 --> 12:03.204
driving his cab.

12:03.298 --> 12:05.615
Nights, weekends,
birthdays, you name it.

12:05.633 --> 12:08.451
Then there was this one day
that I asked to ride along.

12:08.470 --> 12:10.228
We drove all night.

12:10.397 --> 12:15.808
He let me sit up front, he even
taught me how to spot a fake 20.

12:15.961 --> 12:18.461
And then we just
started talking.

12:18.480 --> 12:20.463
He spoke to me about India,

12:20.632 --> 12:22.782
what it was like
immigrating to Queens.

12:23.577 --> 12:25.318
Starting a family.

12:25.412 --> 12:29.914
We never talked like that again.

12:30.066 --> 12:34.919
When he died, I didn't
even get to say goodbye.

12:35.088 --> 12:39.924
What I would do
for just one more day,

12:40.093 --> 12:45.722
one more ride,
one more talk with my dad.

12:47.509 --> 12:50.894
My point is that maybe your
daughter would feel the same.

12:51.830 --> 12:54.664
You don't know our story.

12:54.682 --> 12:56.441
It's our story.

12:56.610 --> 12:59.068
It's not yours.

13:00.005 --> 13:03.097
Just be my doctor,

13:03.266 --> 13:06.743
and try and get me through this.

13:10.181 --> 13:11.664
Okay.

13:25.530 --> 13:27.121
C-spine is cleared.

13:27.290 --> 13:30.624
I know what you're thinking.
(grunts)

13:30.793 --> 13:33.661
That this is karma,
the accident.

13:33.663 --> 13:36.630
The sooner we operate,
the better chance you have

13:36.650 --> 13:38.391
to restore your hand function.

13:38.560 --> 13:40.068
That's what I'm thinking.

13:41.470 --> 13:43.713
I assume you'll be accessing
my brachial plexus

13:43.806 --> 13:45.381
-from my neck?
-Yes.

13:45.474 --> 13:47.808
Once I have, we'll decide
on the best approach

13:47.828 --> 13:49.735
to reattach your scapula
to your thoracic cage

13:49.904 --> 13:51.312
and perform a nerve repair.

13:51.480 --> 13:53.998
I want my surgical residents
to observe you in the OR.

13:54.225 --> 13:57.151
You don't trust me. Fine.

13:57.320 --> 13:59.729
There are other
orthopedic surgeons here.

13:59.822 --> 14:01.414
No, no, I want you.

14:01.583 --> 14:03.883
You're the best.

14:05.661 --> 14:07.570
But I nearly killed
your son-in-law.

14:07.663 --> 14:10.256
Yes, you did.

14:10.350 --> 14:13.309
And now I'm gonna try
and save your surgical career.

14:15.430 --> 14:17.814
(monitor beeping rapidly)

14:20.752 --> 14:23.027
His neck veins are distended.

14:24.606 --> 14:26.347
Heart sounds are faint.

14:27.367 --> 14:29.701
That combined
with your low blood pressure

14:29.870 --> 14:30.927
and tachycardia...

14:31.020 --> 14:33.037
Beck's triad.

14:33.189 --> 14:36.958
Which means I have bigger
problems than just my hands.

14:43.958 --> 14:45.550
I have to tell you something,

14:45.719 --> 14:48.369
otherwise I'm going to explode,
but you can't get mushy,

14:48.537 --> 14:51.038
and have to agree this
conversation never happened.

14:51.132 --> 14:53.057
Okay.

14:54.561 --> 14:56.394
I'm seeing someone.

14:56.545 --> 14:58.396
He works here.

15:00.734 --> 15:02.567
(laughs)

15:02.718 --> 15:05.236
Well, it's about damn time.

15:05.388 --> 15:07.405
Who else knows?

15:07.574 --> 15:09.574
Just you and AJ's cats.

15:09.743 --> 15:11.134
Oh, my God,
I have so many questions.

15:11.302 --> 15:13.077
-When did it start?
-First kiss, your wedding.

15:13.229 --> 15:14.470
First hookup,
shortly after that.

15:14.639 --> 15:16.639
First fight, here.
Now you're caught up.

15:16.658 --> 15:18.174
Wow, you're terrible at this.

15:18.176 --> 15:19.976
I don't know
what else to tell you.

15:19.994 --> 15:22.311
He and I are totally
on the same page.

15:22.330 --> 15:23.421
Most of the time.

15:23.590 --> 15:24.923
But that's another story.

15:25.091 --> 15:26.441
-Now we have ground rules.
-Mm.

15:26.443 --> 15:28.742
-I know all about
the ground rules.
-Exactly.

15:28.911 --> 15:31.654
I had to tell someone, and
obviously that someone was you.

15:31.823 --> 15:32.764
(laughs)

15:32.933 --> 15:34.581
I'm so happy for you.

15:34.601 --> 15:35.992
Thank you.

15:36.161 --> 15:38.937
Wait. Where are you going?

15:40.331 --> 15:41.773
(exhales)

15:42.000 --> 15:44.850
TERRY:
Man or woman is fine.
They just...

15:45.019 --> 15:46.169
they need a face
for camera, okay?

15:46.337 --> 15:48.262
I'm not looking
for a supermodel, just

15:48.281 --> 15:50.097
-someone to share
the frame with you.
-I get it, I get it, a face

15:50.116 --> 15:52.341
-for camera.
-And a nice, safe surgery.

15:52.360 --> 15:53.434
Okay? Nothing too messy.

15:53.453 --> 15:55.178
Or... or sad.

15:55.346 --> 15:57.363
-A quick fix
with a "ring the Bell" ending.
-Nice and safe...

15:57.515 --> 15:59.273
does not make
for impactful television.

15:59.292 --> 16:01.684
-We have to take
a risk here, Terry.
-Okay. Okay.

16:01.853 --> 16:02.794
A<i> small</i> risk.

16:03.021 --> 16:05.296
On a charismatic patient.

16:14.975 --> 16:16.724
(tapping keyboard)

16:18.203 --> 16:20.461
(chuckles)

16:20.480 --> 16:22.730
Bingo.

16:26.544 --> 16:27.968
You look familiar.

16:28.137 --> 16:31.698
Are you one of those...
dancing doctors on TikTok?

16:33.718 --> 16:35.809
BELL:
Mr. Mackey.

16:35.978 --> 16:37.903
I'm Dr. Bell, general surgeon
here at Chastain.

16:38.056 --> 16:39.572
I'll be operating
with Dr. Okafor today.

16:39.724 --> 16:43.075
-Where's Dr. Nolan?
-There was a schedule change.

16:43.228 --> 16:45.578
Let me get to the big question
right at the top.

16:45.730 --> 16:47.338
Will I have a scar?

16:47.507 --> 16:50.157
-A small one.
-A lot of my followers online
are ladies, and,

16:50.326 --> 16:52.918
well, let's just say they don't
follow me for my pithy captions.

16:53.087 --> 16:54.570
-(Bell chuckles)
-They come for this.

16:54.739 --> 16:57.073
And a handful of gents, too,
if I'm being honest.

16:57.166 --> 16:59.183
So I got to keep it
looking prime time.

16:59.335 --> 17:01.427
Well, Emmett,
I'm not just a doctor

17:01.579 --> 17:02.687
here at Chastain.

17:02.914 --> 17:05.172
I also... host a TV show.

17:05.266 --> 17:07.767
And I would like to do
a feature on you.

17:07.935 --> 17:09.510
We'd interview you

17:09.604 --> 17:11.195
and then film the surgery.

17:11.347 --> 17:12.772
With your permission, of course.

17:12.924 --> 17:14.590
I love it. Have at it.

17:14.609 --> 17:16.784
Exploit me.
(laughs)

17:18.096 --> 17:20.705
<i> WOMAN (over P.A.):</i>
<i> CT, pick up line 2292.</i>

17:20.856 --> 17:22.540
<i> CT, pick up extension 2292.</i>

17:22.709 --> 17:24.876
Why are there cameras here?

17:25.027 --> 17:27.545
I don't want to be filmed.

17:27.696 --> 17:30.131
They can't film you
without your consent.

17:30.958 --> 17:32.699
Um, your chart said that

17:32.794 --> 17:34.886
you have rheumatoid arthritis.
Are you on any medications?

17:35.037 --> 17:37.388
Not anymore.
Nothing ever worked.

17:37.557 --> 17:39.891
Hmm.

17:40.894 --> 17:41.893
(Eva groans)

17:42.062 --> 17:43.061
(whispers):
Sorry.

17:43.229 --> 17:45.621
-(panting)
-Where you from?

17:45.640 --> 17:47.857
The Midwest.

17:48.960 --> 17:50.860
Oh, my God.

17:52.405 --> 17:54.630
No. I'm on television.

17:54.649 --> 17:56.223
Take out my IV.

17:56.242 --> 17:57.817
No, we're still waiting
on your lab results.

17:57.911 --> 17:59.302
Hey, don't do that.

17:59.470 --> 18:00.411
Hey!

18:02.248 --> 18:05.416
-(groans)
-We need some help over here!

18:13.093 --> 18:15.818
Yep, just as expected.
The fluid around your heart

18:15.987 --> 18:17.153
is preventing it
from pumping properly.

18:17.171 --> 18:19.097
You know I'm a doctor,
too, right?

18:20.600 --> 18:24.660
Your pericardial effusion is
growing and causing tamponade.

18:24.679 --> 18:26.086
Why didn't you
catch this earlier?

18:26.106 --> 18:28.164
When I did your initial
FAST exam in the ER,

18:28.182 --> 18:30.166
it wasn't there, which means

18:30.184 --> 18:32.001
two hours ago,
you couldn't even see it.

18:32.019 --> 18:33.427
-So now you drain it.
-KIT: Yes.

18:33.596 --> 18:35.762
But you might have
a cardiac or aortic injury

18:35.931 --> 18:37.340
-that needs repair.
-My hands are

18:37.358 --> 18:38.950
the painfully obvious
priority here.

18:39.119 --> 18:40.934
Heart before hands, I'm afraid.

18:40.954 --> 18:42.769
How long until I can operate?

18:42.972 --> 18:44.438
Just enough time
for me to perform

18:44.607 --> 18:45.848
a pericardiocentesis and drain.

18:45.850 --> 18:47.291
Then he's all yours.

18:47.518 --> 18:48.751
Okay.

18:56.861 --> 18:58.285
This is Eva.

18:58.454 --> 19:00.696
She tried to run
when she saw herself on TV.

19:00.865 --> 19:02.214
Any explanation?

19:02.367 --> 19:05.959
She's still in Bay One refusing
to answer any questions.

19:06.128 --> 19:08.629
I mean, she understands
that she needs to stay, but...

19:08.648 --> 19:10.464
she's still visibly shaken.

19:10.633 --> 19:11.965
Head CT's negative.

19:12.059 --> 19:14.059
But the labs show
she's in renal failure.

19:14.228 --> 19:15.544
Spiking a fever.

19:15.638 --> 19:16.970
I'll send for a new set of labs,

19:16.990 --> 19:18.898
but we're
definitely missing something.

19:19.050 --> 19:21.066
I'll try her emergency contact,

19:21.235 --> 19:23.369
see if they can help us
figure out what's going on here.

19:25.814 --> 19:27.740
Any news
on that other blood test?

19:27.834 --> 19:29.909
The important one to us?

19:30.077 --> 19:31.485
(whispers):
Still waiting.

19:31.654 --> 19:33.729
Hi. This is Dr. Hawkins
at Chastain Park Memorial.

19:33.822 --> 19:35.581
I'm calling about Eva Wolman.

19:35.733 --> 19:37.216
We just admitted her.

19:38.069 --> 19:39.927
That's correct.

19:43.090 --> 19:45.257
Okay. I understand.

19:45.426 --> 19:47.393
Thank you.

19:49.505 --> 19:53.173
The number Eva listed belongs
to an FBI agent.

19:53.267 --> 19:54.099
He's on his way.

19:54.268 --> 19:55.860
He says we need to secure
her area.

19:56.029 --> 19:57.937
No visitors.
Direct medical personnel.

19:58.031 --> 20:00.756
I'm guessing she's in some sort
of witness protection program.

20:00.849 --> 20:03.201
Okay, well, then we should get
her a guard and a private room.

20:03.352 --> 20:04.685
I'll call security.

20:04.946 --> 20:08.247
If someone wanted to hurt Eva,
now they know where to find her.

20:14.196 --> 20:18.549
All right, fluid has drained
from your heart.

20:18.701 --> 20:20.426
Confirm with echo.

20:26.875 --> 20:27.892
AUSTIN:
Hmm.

20:28.061 --> 20:30.895
Ham and cheese crepe.

20:32.398 --> 20:35.958
I was in the cafeteria,
dining on that savory galette

20:35.977 --> 20:38.961
when they told me
Chastain's next recruit

20:39.130 --> 20:41.756
was<i> the</i> Barrett Cain.

20:41.816 --> 20:44.650
The food wasn't inspiring,
but the name was.

20:44.744 --> 20:46.077
Why?

20:46.246 --> 20:47.319
Come on, man.

20:47.413 --> 20:51.249
Another surgical god
under the same roof?

20:51.417 --> 20:53.960
And a brother at that.

20:54.996 --> 20:57.162
I had hoped for...

20:57.257 --> 20:59.148
a colleague,

20:59.166 --> 21:01.150
a comrade.

21:01.168 --> 21:03.594
But, brother,
you have managed to alienate

21:03.763 --> 21:07.156
every single doctor
in this hospital.

21:07.174 --> 21:11.176
And even still,
I have my instincts.

21:11.345 --> 21:15.498
That hope I felt
is still very much alive.

21:15.666 --> 21:17.275
We know traumatic events
like this

21:17.502 --> 21:21.170
can have a profound impact
on one's constitution.

21:21.188 --> 21:24.673
You know? So maybe you come out
on the other side of this,

21:24.692 --> 21:28.010
surgical gifts intact...

21:28.029 --> 21:30.103
with a different outlook
on life.

21:30.272 --> 21:34.917
Are you testifying against me
in the Mullins lawsuit?

21:38.356 --> 21:40.614
You're too proud
not to tell me if it was you.

21:40.633 --> 21:41.966
So who is it?

21:43.952 --> 21:47.138
I will tell them to prep the OR.

21:56.316 --> 21:58.357
♪

22:01.804 --> 22:04.304
So, how soon
can we transfer her?

22:04.324 --> 22:05.397
We don't know.

22:05.550 --> 22:06.899
What do you mean you don't know?

22:07.051 --> 22:08.642
We're trying to figure out
what's wrong with her.

22:08.661 --> 22:10.069
Eva wasn't severely injured
in the crash

22:10.221 --> 22:11.478
and yet her organs are failing.

22:11.647 --> 22:13.414
We need to figure out
what's going on with her.

22:15.743 --> 22:16.909
We pulled this
from your cameras.

22:17.061 --> 22:18.819
This guy approached
the front desk

22:18.987 --> 22:20.171
looking for her room number.

22:20.340 --> 22:22.081
When they asked his name,
he disappeared.

22:22.249 --> 22:23.916
Let's notify Chastain--
tell them to report

22:24.085 --> 22:25.067
but not engage him.

22:25.160 --> 22:26.752
Should assume he's dangerous.

22:26.904 --> 22:29.088
How much danger is she in?

22:29.256 --> 22:30.589
She testified
against some powerful people.

22:30.741 --> 22:31.849
That's all I can say.

22:32.000 --> 22:33.351
So figure out
what's wrong with her,

22:33.502 --> 22:36.062
'cause she's not safe here.

22:41.268 --> 22:42.843
Emmett's crits
are drifting down.

22:42.937 --> 22:44.920
He may have a bleed
from his spleen or liver.

22:45.013 --> 22:46.179
Surgery is risky,

22:46.273 --> 22:47.698
with the potential
for complications.

22:47.850 --> 22:50.609
-Agreed.
-So filming it is unethical.

22:50.761 --> 22:52.036
The patient consented.

22:52.205 --> 22:54.038
Just because he said yes
doesn't make it right.

22:54.207 --> 22:56.040
I think we should attempt
this laparoscopically.

22:56.191 --> 22:58.283
We need to be focused
on what happens in the OR.

22:58.452 --> 22:59.952
Our minds should be fully on
Emmett, not on cameras,

23:00.121 --> 23:01.194
-which could...
-My mind is

23:01.214 --> 23:03.547
exactly where it needs to be.

23:03.716 --> 23:05.365
You don't understand...

23:05.385 --> 23:06.700
No, I understand. They took
your face off the building,

23:06.794 --> 23:07.718
so you had to find
some other place

23:07.870 --> 23:09.553
to put it.

23:09.722 --> 23:11.222
I'm a surgeon first.

23:11.373 --> 23:13.391
Mm. Not today.

23:23.069 --> 23:25.111
(footsteps approaching)

23:26.964 --> 23:29.824
Good news.
Your labs are improving.

23:32.153 --> 23:34.578
<i> MAN (over P.A.):</i>
<i> Available RN to Surgical.</i>

23:34.747 --> 23:35.988
That looks painful.

23:36.082 --> 23:37.915
Must have been
from the accident.

23:38.066 --> 23:39.917
I've always bruised easily.

23:45.499 --> 23:47.925
No, no, it's okay. It's okay,
it's okay. I just wanna see her.

23:48.094 --> 23:49.501
It's all right.
I won't let him hurt you.

23:49.595 --> 23:50.970
He's not here to hurt me.

23:51.931 --> 23:54.723
I'm the one who hurt him.

24:04.110 --> 24:06.335
I think it would be good
for them to talk to each other,

24:06.353 --> 24:07.761
under supervision.

24:07.780 --> 24:09.505
Eva's very happy to see him.

24:09.523 --> 24:11.173
Says they've known each other
their entire lives.

24:11.342 --> 24:13.525
That doesn't mean
he's not a threat.

24:13.694 --> 24:15.511
Until we complete a full
background check on this guy,

24:15.529 --> 24:16.512
we keep them separate.

24:16.530 --> 24:17.513
Understood?

24:17.531 --> 24:19.181
Okay, yeah. Fair enough.

24:19.350 --> 24:21.375
-I'll talk to her.
-Mm.

24:25.113 --> 24:27.298
I was moonlighting
at this little dive bar down on

24:27.525 --> 24:29.800
Park Street, and, uh...

24:30.027 --> 24:32.786
one day, she walked in.
(chuckles softly)

24:32.989 --> 24:35.288
She looked at me, and...

24:35.457 --> 24:38.458
we basically had our first date
right then and there. (chuckles)

24:38.627 --> 24:40.460
Only a few months in,
we were already talking

24:40.480 --> 24:42.371
about marriage.

24:42.464 --> 24:43.964
I wanted a summer wedding.

24:44.132 --> 24:45.149
Eva hates the cold.

24:45.376 --> 24:46.725
So much that I-I had to get rid

24:46.877 --> 24:47.726
of my Bobcats season tickets.

24:47.895 --> 24:49.545
That's how much she hates it.

24:49.714 --> 24:51.947
He stopped going
to hockey games.

24:52.975 --> 24:55.234
That's how much he loved me.

24:55.386 --> 24:57.203
(chuckles)

25:03.744 --> 25:06.086
And then, one day, she was gone.

25:07.823 --> 25:09.414
No calls.

25:09.567 --> 25:10.508
Nothing.

25:10.659 --> 25:12.417
She wouldn't return my messages.

25:12.586 --> 25:15.328
My friends all said
that I had moved too fast and...

25:15.497 --> 25:17.256
I spooked her,
that she ghosted me.

25:17.408 --> 25:20.259
But that didn't make any sense,
'cause we were good together.

25:21.262 --> 25:22.928
My sister lives in Atlanta.
So when she texted me

25:23.097 --> 25:24.263
and said that she saw Eva on TV,

25:24.431 --> 25:26.690
I just got on
the next flight here.

25:26.842 --> 25:27.933
Even if she never wanted
to see me again,

25:28.085 --> 25:29.401
I needed to know why.

25:30.588 --> 25:33.030
I couldn't tell him why.

25:35.593 --> 25:39.537
I blew the whistle
at the firm where I worked.

25:39.705 --> 25:42.331
Insider trading.

25:43.267 --> 25:45.042
My words sent guys to prison.

25:45.211 --> 25:47.452
FBI said I had to go
into witness protection,

25:47.605 --> 25:50.256
and I didn't want
to bring Darren into that.

25:51.867 --> 25:53.884
I've been where you are.

25:54.053 --> 25:56.053
I was a whistleblower.

25:56.204 --> 25:58.113
Yeah.

25:58.132 --> 26:00.115
And I was afraid
that doing the right thing

26:00.134 --> 26:02.393
would hurt someone I love.

26:04.046 --> 26:08.399
So, I know the pain
that comes with that.

26:08.568 --> 26:10.776
I didn't want to hurt him.

26:11.796 --> 26:14.196
I still don't.

26:15.482 --> 26:17.966
But I still think about him.

26:17.985 --> 26:19.743
You could tell him that.

26:19.970 --> 26:20.744
-(groans softly)
-(laughs)

26:20.913 --> 26:22.137
(sniffles)

26:22.306 --> 26:24.473
-Might give you closure.
-(chuckles)

26:24.642 --> 26:26.141
Closure.

26:26.160 --> 26:27.142
Yeah.

26:27.311 --> 26:29.494
That could be good
for both of us.

26:29.589 --> 26:30.979
(inhales sharply)

26:30.998 --> 26:33.107
-(slurring): Could you...
-Eva. Eva.

26:33.109 --> 26:35.926
Eva. Squeeze my fingers.
Squeeze my fingers.

26:38.431 --> 26:39.504
Call a code stroke!

26:39.599 --> 26:40.598
(phone vibrates)

26:40.766 --> 26:42.491
What?

26:42.509 --> 26:43.767
What is it?

26:43.994 --> 26:46.395
I'm sorry. It's an emergency.
I have to go.

26:49.333 --> 26:50.757
TERRY:
Wide-- we want to feel
the whole room.

26:50.776 --> 26:52.926
Get all the toys,
everything that's...

26:52.945 --> 26:54.670
Soon as they land,
tight on Bell.

26:54.688 --> 26:56.947
Get a few shots of the surgery,
but I don't want to see

26:57.116 --> 26:59.099
<i> too much mess.</i>
<i> You, I don't want...</i>

26:59.118 --> 27:01.935
Hope it's more fun being on your
show than it is watching it.

27:01.954 --> 27:03.603
You've seen it?

27:03.623 --> 27:04.788
Once.

27:04.940 --> 27:06.439
While folding laundry.

27:06.608 --> 27:09.293
You oversimplify science.

27:09.520 --> 27:11.945
You referred to a minor study
as "evidence."

27:11.964 --> 27:14.131
And now you're bringing
your entourage into the OR.

27:15.134 --> 27:15.949
Also,

27:15.968 --> 27:17.617
you wear too much makeup.

27:17.786 --> 27:19.953

His pressure's plummeting,

27:21.623 --> 27:22.640
-heart rate's rising.
-He must be bleeding out.

27:22.867 --> 27:24.224
We got to move.

27:26.628 --> 27:28.871

27:29.039 --> 27:31.398
(monitor flatlining)

27:38.491 --> 27:40.741
(sighs deeply)

27:43.145 --> 27:45.120
Hey.

27:46.332 --> 27:47.706
You okay?

27:49.059 --> 27:51.076
Yeah. I lost a patient.

27:51.228 --> 27:52.411
It was expected,

27:52.563 --> 27:53.687
but still...

27:53.689 --> 27:54.913
Is the family here?

27:55.065 --> 27:56.489
I'll notify them for you.

27:56.658 --> 27:58.250
-There's no one.
-(phone vibrates)

27:58.402 --> 28:00.752
He died alone.

28:01.681 --> 28:04.807
Sorry.
Losing someone's never easy.

28:05.910 --> 28:08.260
I tried to get him to...

28:08.429 --> 28:12.231
call his daughter, talk to her
one last time, but...

28:13.675 --> 28:14.599
I'll get someone
to cover for you.

28:14.768 --> 28:16.360
No.

28:17.421 --> 28:18.344
I'm okay.

28:18.364 --> 28:20.239
I just need a minute.

28:28.874 --> 28:31.083
When do we expect Dr. Voss?

28:32.953 --> 28:34.286
She's late.

28:34.380 --> 28:36.714
She must be wrapping up
her last surgery.

28:36.865 --> 28:38.048
Cain's already under.

28:38.158 --> 28:40.926
He always lets us start
without him.

28:41.795 --> 28:43.462
DAVIS:
He used to say,

28:43.630 --> 28:45.038
"How else will we learn?

28:45.132 --> 28:46.372
"Closed eyes mean cut away.

28:46.425 --> 28:48.559
No need to wait
for the attending."

28:48.728 --> 28:49.952

Oh, crap. He's awake!

28:54.734 --> 28:56.458
Up his sedation!

(gasps)
Dr. Cain!

29:01.315 --> 29:02.314

Uh, Dr. Bell?
A little camera right, please.

Perfect.

29:30.344 --> 29:32.853

29:34.164 --> 29:35.606
Spleen is dry.
We should have done an ex-lap.

29:35.775 --> 29:38.442
The source of the bleed must be
coming from the liver lac.

29:38.611 --> 29:39.926
Is it coming
from the arteries or the vein?

29:39.945 --> 29:42.905
I still-- I can't see a thing.

29:44.008 --> 29:45.007
He's gonna bottom out soon.

29:53.517 --> 29:54.774
How is she?

29:54.977 --> 29:57.686
I wish we had better news.

29:57.855 --> 29:59.797
Eva had a mild stroke.

30:00.633 --> 30:01.948
Are you saying she could die?

30:02.117 --> 30:03.091
We're monitoring her.

30:04.528 --> 30:06.303
I finally find her after
all this time, and now this?

30:06.530 --> 30:09.622
We're doing everything we can,
Darren.

30:09.791 --> 30:11.883
But we need your help.

30:12.036 --> 30:13.793
I don't understand.

30:13.962 --> 30:15.336
We don't know Eva, but you do.

30:15.338 --> 30:16.872
Is there anything
about her medical history

30:16.965 --> 30:18.223
that you could tell us?

30:18.375 --> 30:20.058
Something that could help us
figure this out.

30:20.210 --> 30:21.543
Anything out of the ordinary?

30:21.636 --> 30:25.063
I-I-I'm sorry.
Nothing's coming to mind, no.

30:25.215 --> 30:28.141
You know, when you love someone,

30:28.235 --> 30:30.569
we... dismiss certain things.

30:30.737 --> 30:32.979
-Certain quirks become normal.
-Yeah.

30:33.148 --> 30:35.390
What about those types
of things?

30:35.483 --> 30:38.894
Yeah, yeah. She used to, uh,
try to hide her stress.

30:38.987 --> 30:41.079
Um, especially during midterms
or finals.

30:41.231 --> 30:43.656
Not many people could tell,
but I knew. (exhales)

30:43.825 --> 30:45.509
She used to talk in her sleep.

30:45.660 --> 30:47.827
Sometimes it was creepy, but...

30:47.996 --> 30:49.680
most of the time,
it was pretty hilarious.

30:49.831 --> 30:51.406
And she would eat, uh, odd foods

30:51.499 --> 30:52.999
at weird times.

30:53.168 --> 30:54.593
And she would break out
in this, um,

30:54.761 --> 30:56.411
purple rash
every once in a while.

30:56.504 --> 30:58.522
But I'm only remembering that
'cause she was so self-conscious

30:58.673 --> 31:01.750
-of it.
-Did this rash
look like a bruise?

31:01.768 --> 31:04.920
-U-Uh, yeah. Sort of.
-And would it come
at a certain time of year?

31:05.089 --> 31:06.438
Now that you mention it, yeah.

31:06.607 --> 31:07.513
In the winter.

31:07.608 --> 31:08.790
Purpuric lesions.

31:08.850 --> 31:10.442
Renal failure. Fever.

31:10.611 --> 31:15.122
Combine that with her diagnosis
of rheumatoid arthritis...

31:16.191 --> 31:17.249
(exhales)

31:19.194 --> 31:22.880
NIC:
Eva, you have a condition
called cryoglobulinemia.

31:23.031 --> 31:25.957
It's rare and can be mistaken
for rheumatoid arthritis.

31:26.126 --> 31:27.867
And it's why your meds
never helped.

31:27.961 --> 31:30.112
And why you always hated
the cold.

31:30.205 --> 31:32.723
Cryoglobulins
are proteins in your blood.

31:32.874 --> 31:34.224
They clump together
during the cold,

31:34.376 --> 31:35.726
get trapped
in your blood vessels,

31:35.895 --> 31:37.227
like a-- like a traffic jam.

31:37.396 --> 31:39.229
And why am I so sick now?

31:39.381 --> 31:41.881
It was cold outside
during the accident

31:42.050 --> 31:43.291
-and you weren't kept warm.
-And the nurse

31:43.310 --> 31:45.235
turned the temperature down
in your room

31:45.387 --> 31:46.628
because of your fever.

31:46.797 --> 31:48.797
And this rash is--
it's actually called "purpura."

31:48.815 --> 31:50.574
And it's due
to the cryoglobulins clumping

31:50.725 --> 31:51.983
in the vessels in your skin.

31:52.077 --> 31:53.969
And they're doing
the same thing in your brain,

31:54.062 --> 31:56.638
which is why you had
a mild stroke.

31:56.807 --> 31:58.640
But now we can treat you.

31:58.659 --> 32:00.475
CONRAD:
We're just gonna get this blood

32:00.494 --> 32:02.419
to the lab, confirm it.

32:02.588 --> 32:03.812
(inhales)

32:03.830 --> 32:06.214
We'll be right back.

32:09.653 --> 32:11.762
(monitors beeping rapidly)

32:14.124 --> 32:15.991
Who told you
to start without me?

32:16.009 --> 32:17.659
We always start
without Dr. Cain, so...

32:17.828 --> 32:20.586
Well, this is my OR.
And in my OR,

32:20.606 --> 32:22.439
residents
never cut unsupervised.

32:22.590 --> 32:23.440
You should have waited.

32:23.667 --> 32:24.924
Step aside.

32:24.944 --> 32:27.335
-(alarm beeping)
-O2 sats and BP are falling.

32:27.354 --> 32:29.112
-What the hell did you do?
-We just started

32:29.339 --> 32:31.022
the dissection.
It was going perfectly.

32:31.175 --> 32:32.507
Well, this situation
says otherwise.

32:32.676 --> 32:35.193
You went too deep and punctured
Cain's pleural cavity.

32:35.345 --> 32:37.955
We need thoracic.
Page Dr. Austin.

32:39.959 --> 32:41.792
(monitor beeping)

32:43.036 --> 32:44.186
I still don't have
source control.

32:44.354 --> 32:46.279
Activate
massive transfusion protocol.

32:46.298 --> 32:47.947
-Get the cameras out of here.
-Just keep rolling.

32:47.967 --> 32:49.782
-Don't stop shooting.
-BELL: We got this.

32:49.802 --> 32:51.635
Converting to open.

32:58.460 --> 32:59.893
Hold down on the liver.

33:01.705 --> 33:02.887
MINA:
What next?

33:03.040 --> 33:04.556
Partial hepatectomy.

33:04.650 --> 33:06.725
Resecting a part of his liver
could cause more bleeding.

33:06.877 --> 33:08.134
He's already lost
half his volume.

33:08.153 --> 33:09.728
He can't afford to lose more.

33:09.880 --> 33:11.804
It's a risk we have to take,
and we've got to be perfect.

33:11.824 --> 33:13.548
Retractors.

33:13.641 --> 33:14.716
BELL:
Stapler.

33:14.809 --> 33:16.660
Blue load.

33:19.331 --> 33:20.813
There it is.

33:20.982 --> 33:23.875
-Hepatic vein bleeding.
-Right angle to me.

33:24.745 --> 33:26.211
One more staple. Blue load.

33:28.232 --> 33:29.914
MINA:
Ligating the vein.

33:30.067 --> 33:32.417
(stapler clacking)

33:32.569 --> 33:34.928
(monitor chirps)

33:36.406 --> 33:38.265
Bleeding stopped.

33:43.096 --> 33:45.430
Call down to the blood bank
for more blood products.

33:45.599 --> 33:46.931
More suction.

33:47.100 --> 33:48.750
All right, Kit, lay it on me.

33:48.919 --> 33:50.101
KIT:
Tension pneumothorax.

33:50.270 --> 33:52.696
We decompressed it,
but now he needs a chest tube

33:52.923 --> 33:54.180
and a vessel repair.

33:54.274 --> 33:57.075
Which one of you neophytes
punctured Cain's lung?

33:58.037 --> 34:00.412
I need a chest tube. Scalpel.

34:01.874 --> 34:03.874
-How's the view?
-Better.

34:04.025 --> 34:05.709
I found the bleeder.

34:14.795 --> 34:17.128
(monitor beeping)

34:17.297 --> 34:18.947
AUSTIN:
All right, normally, this is

34:18.965 --> 34:21.165
the part of the story
where he stabilizes.

34:21.301 --> 34:23.810
Then why the hell hasn't he?

34:29.568 --> 34:31.551
What is this, Bikram ICU?
It's hot in here,

34:31.570 --> 34:32.794
-even for me.
-Well,

34:32.813 --> 34:34.071
we have to keep you warm
so this machine

34:34.239 --> 34:36.965
can remove the abnormal protein
from your blood.

34:37.134 --> 34:39.242
You're gonna make a full
recovery. And now that you have

34:39.394 --> 34:41.078
a proper diagnosis,
you're gonna feel

34:41.246 --> 34:42.304
better than ever.

34:42.472 --> 34:44.806
Thank you.

34:44.975 --> 34:47.751
(footsteps approaching)

34:56.670 --> 34:58.845
-Hi.
-DARREN: Hey.

34:59.823 --> 35:01.005
So, on a scale from one to ten,

35:01.100 --> 35:05.418
how, um, upset/angry are you?

35:05.437 --> 35:10.107
At the moment,
I'm just glad you're okay.

35:16.840 --> 35:20.742
I owe you
a long explanation and...

35:22.679 --> 35:25.705
I really missed you.

35:27.351 --> 35:29.126
I guess I thought about you
a little bit, too.

35:29.353 --> 35:31.920
(both laugh)

35:33.781 --> 35:35.090
Eva...

35:36.117 --> 35:37.859
I got a job that I hate

35:38.028 --> 35:39.785
and a special-needs bulldog
that I love.

35:39.954 --> 35:43.890
Would it be crazy
if we came with you this time?

35:45.310 --> 35:47.627
Darren, this...

35:47.795 --> 35:50.372
isn't a decision
you make in a moment.

35:50.465 --> 35:52.040
Trust me.

35:52.133 --> 35:55.059
I've lived it.
You have to be sure.

35:56.137 --> 35:58.213
I would love
for us to be together again,

35:58.306 --> 36:01.992
but I understand
if you can't do this.

36:02.143 --> 36:03.643
Don't try to talk me out of it.

36:03.662 --> 36:05.311
I'm sure.

36:05.514 --> 36:07.572
(both chuckle softly)

36:07.741 --> 36:09.916
(both laughing)

36:20.420 --> 36:22.179
-That's Mr. McCloud's daughter.
-(crying)

36:22.347 --> 36:23.588
He called her before he died,

36:23.740 --> 36:24.906
but she came too late
to see him.

36:24.999 --> 36:26.808
-Thanks.
-Yeah.

36:27.594 --> 36:28.501
(knocks)

36:28.595 --> 36:29.686
Hi, I'm Dr. Pravesh.

36:29.837 --> 36:32.096
I treated your father.

36:32.265 --> 36:33.982
I'm...

36:34.768 --> 36:35.859
I'm sorry.

36:36.028 --> 36:39.237
If it helps,
he wasn't in any pain.

36:43.351 --> 36:45.660
I wanted to see him.

36:49.783 --> 36:52.951
(sniffles)
It had been too long.

36:53.119 --> 36:55.962
I thought there was time.

36:58.124 --> 37:00.425
At least he called me.

37:02.946 --> 37:04.888
We got to talk for a bit.

37:05.039 --> 37:07.265
I got to apologize.

37:08.376 --> 37:10.060
(sniffles)

37:11.212 --> 37:14.064
I'm s...
I'm so glad he reached you.

37:14.215 --> 37:17.275
And I'm so grateful to you.

37:18.311 --> 37:21.154
He said
you convinced him to call.

37:23.483 --> 37:27.077
We always think there's
so much more time, and then...

37:27.279 --> 37:30.664
something happens
out of the blue.

37:33.810 --> 37:35.919
(Ariana crying)

37:36.813 --> 37:38.421
I'm so sorry for your loss.

37:38.590 --> 37:42.074
I'll send one of our counselors
to come talk to you.

37:42.094 --> 37:44.135
Thank you.

37:46.006 --> 37:48.765
Well, as you've seen,
medicine is unpredictable.

37:48.992 --> 37:50.416
No matter how much you prepare,

37:50.435 --> 37:54.829
the human body
is full of surprises.

37:54.998 --> 37:56.347
How you feeling?

37:56.516 --> 37:59.501
Warm. Tingly.
Like I could hug you.

37:59.519 --> 38:02.762
(chuckles) Well,
that could be the pain meds.

38:02.930 --> 38:05.340
What's your handle?

38:05.509 --> 38:07.433
For Twitter.

38:07.452 --> 38:08.768
-Insta.
-I...

38:08.936 --> 38:11.179
So I can follow you.

38:11.197 --> 38:12.680
I don't do that.

38:12.849 --> 38:14.273
(chuckles)

38:14.293 --> 38:16.942
Give me your phone.

38:17.037 --> 38:19.278
(Bell clears throat)

38:19.447 --> 38:22.782
Well, I guess
I'll be doing that.

38:22.801 --> 38:24.450
<i> Every day,</i>

38:24.660 --> 38:26.970
patients walk through the doors
of Chastain

38:27.197 --> 38:28.621
with different needs,

38:28.682 --> 38:31.957
and our staff is ready.

38:32.126 --> 38:34.719
Our doctors and nurses
work tirelessly.

38:34.871 --> 38:37.314
They care deeply.

38:37.465 --> 38:40.058
Sacrifice willingly.

38:40.226 --> 38:44.637
This hospital is a cornerstone
of this community

38:44.806 --> 38:46.881
and a center
for medical innovation,

38:46.974 --> 38:50.068
and that's why I'm so proud

38:50.162 --> 38:53.388
to call
Chastain Park Memorial home.

38:53.481 --> 38:55.406
And cut! Fantastic.

38:55.559 --> 38:57.075
We got it, Dr. Bell.

38:57.227 --> 38:59.077
-All right?
-TERRY: Yeah.

38:59.229 --> 39:02.580
Hey, thanks, Randolph.
You were right.

39:02.732 --> 39:04.582
This was a smart play.

39:04.734 --> 39:07.260
Thanks.

39:09.089 --> 39:11.163
Bet you're glad
the circus is leaving town.

39:11.332 --> 39:13.908
I was wrong.

39:14.001 --> 39:17.062
You didn't bring
the cameras here for you.

39:18.765 --> 39:20.940
You're trying to help Chastain.

39:22.009 --> 39:24.152
How bad is it?

39:26.272 --> 39:27.739
Bad.

39:29.092 --> 39:31.534
You're not the only one
who loves this place.

39:31.686 --> 39:34.204
So, what can we do?

39:36.116 --> 39:38.541
What happened in there?

39:38.768 --> 39:39.876
Cardiac tamponade.

39:40.027 --> 39:41.953
I thought he had
a pericardial drain in place.

39:42.122 --> 39:43.880
Yeah, he did. And it clotted.

39:44.031 --> 39:45.882
By the time I cracked his chest
and got him on bypass,

39:46.033 --> 39:47.550
15 minutes went by.

39:47.702 --> 39:48.885
Even with cardiac massage,

39:49.054 --> 39:51.279
there's no way to know
if his brain

39:51.297 --> 39:53.131
was adequately perfused
for those 15 minutes.

39:53.299 --> 39:56.226
But we do know we don't want
survival for survival's sake.

39:56.395 --> 40:00.397
We want our patients to be more
than just a body in a bed.

40:00.548 --> 40:02.065
No matter who it is.

40:02.234 --> 40:04.792
-And his hands?
-KIT: We'll have to wait

40:04.811 --> 40:06.069
to do his brachial plexus repair

40:06.220 --> 40:08.129
-when he's stabilized.
-(pager vibrating)

40:08.148 --> 40:10.365
Yeah. That's<i> if</i> he wakes up.

40:13.820 --> 40:16.704
I got to go. Keep me posted.

40:33.932 --> 40:35.840
CONRAD:
Can we agree that if one of us

40:36.009 --> 40:37.825
goes into witness protection,
we both do?

40:37.994 --> 40:40.270
Yep, definitely.

40:40.497 --> 40:42.330
With our chickens.

40:42.499 --> 40:45.424
-We got to raise them right.
-(laughing)

40:45.593 --> 40:48.403
Now that we're clear on that...

40:50.840 --> 40:52.615
Are the results in?

40:52.842 --> 40:55.410
Just a click away.

40:57.939 --> 40:59.347
I may have already ordered

40:59.516 --> 41:02.292
a case of nonalcoholic
sparkling cider for you.

41:02.519 --> 41:05.462
And a few other things.

41:05.689 --> 41:06.688
Like what?

41:06.856 --> 41:08.798
Prenatal vitamins.

41:08.967 --> 41:10.467
Pregnancy pillows.

41:10.694 --> 41:11.968
(chuckles):
What?

41:12.195 --> 41:14.119
-Support bands.
-Wow.

41:14.139 --> 41:16.288
-Oils for your stomach.
A heat wrap for your back.
-Conrad.

41:16.308 --> 41:18.290
-(laughs)
-And a foot massager. I know,

41:18.459 --> 41:20.218
I jumped the gun
just a little bit, but...

41:20.370 --> 41:22.127
I may have bought
some oils, too.

41:22.296 --> 41:25.206
-Huh.
-And some leggings.
Lots of leggings.

41:25.375 --> 41:27.233
Oh. (chuckles)

41:31.881 --> 41:34.640
I think we're ready.

41:34.659 --> 41:36.993
Let's do it.

41:38.813 --> 41:40.288
(sighs)

41:45.361 --> 41:46.728
(chuckles softly)

41:46.821 --> 41:48.730
It's official.

41:48.823 --> 41:52.416
(inhales)
It's official.

41:52.585 --> 41:55.094
(laughs)
Aw.

41:59.926 --> 42:01.935
♪

42:12.531 --> 42:16.199
Now, that is the only face
I want to see

42:16.350 --> 42:18.326
after the day I had.

42:19.262 --> 42:21.538
Our rule was no physical contact

42:21.689 --> 42:24.207
inside the hospital.

42:25.210 --> 42:28.211
Yeah, I don't think we ever
locked that one down completely.

42:28.362 --> 42:31.548
Besides, you know rules
are always subject to revision.

42:31.699 --> 42:33.216
-Mm-mm.
-No?

42:33.385 --> 42:36.386
Moot, as we're not...

42:36.537 --> 42:39.264
-inside.
-Mm-hmm.

42:54.147 --> 42:56.130
You okay?

42:56.149 --> 42:57.574
Yeah.
