<i>CARA: Previously on The Tomorrow People... </i>

00:07.836 --> 00:10.266
It's only a matter of time before
the Founder finds out I'm back.

00:10.290 --> 00:12.457
- You're gonna run?
- If he forces me into that machine,

00:12.473 --> 00:14.272
those people inside are all in danger.

00:14.274 --> 00:16.660
The Founder wants to use the
Machine to kill every man,

00:16.661 --> 00:19.700
- woman and child on the planet.
- Every human.

00:19.712 --> 00:21.379
We can't let the Founder
turn us into killers.

00:21.381 --> 00:22.747
We're killers either way, Roger.

00:22.749 --> 00:24.482
- Don't do this.
- I'm sorry, Roger.

00:24.484 --> 00:26.283
We brought your guy.

00:26.285 --> 00:29.119
Hello Roger. Seems like your sewer
rats weren't as loyal as you'd hoped.

00:29.121 --> 00:30.822
Russell, Natalie, and a few of the others.

00:30.824 --> 00:32.156
They took your father into Ultra.

00:54.111 --> 00:56.580
ASTRID: Why aren't you helping Stephen?

00:56.662 --> 00:59.963
He's gonna get himself killed.
Breaking into Ultra alone.

00:59.965 --> 01:02.031
He's not alone.

01:02.033 --> 01:04.132
What do you mean?

01:04.135 --> 01:06.937
Why else would Jedikiah
take Irene's powers?

01:06.939 --> 01:08.737
To use them against the Founder.

01:08.739 --> 01:12.208
According to Irene, the human body
will eventually reject our powers.

01:13.210 --> 01:14.944
The only question is when?

01:23.243 --> 01:24.476
ULTRA GUARD 1: Hold it right there!

01:29.415 --> 01:30.482
(GRUNTING)

01:35.555 --> 01:36.689
ULTRA GUARD 2: Put 'em up!

01:38.391 --> 01:39.424
(GUNSHOTS)

01:43.162 --> 01:44.262
Roger!

01:45.431 --> 01:48.032
No! Stay back.

01:48.199 --> 01:49.866
No, no, I have to get you out of here.

01:49.868 --> 01:51.468
Stop!

01:51.470 --> 01:53.236
Come any closer and you're
gonna be the first to die.

01:53.238 --> 01:55.138
You're human.

01:55.140 --> 01:56.373
I know.

01:56.375 --> 01:59.308
I finally had powers of
my own but they failed me.

01:59.310 --> 02:01.343
I'm sorry I failed you.

02:01.345 --> 02:03.913
(BREATHING HEAVILY) Don't
worry, you can still stop it.

02:09.853 --> 02:13.156
No. I'm not going to kill you, Roger.

02:13.158 --> 02:16.458
Run the numbers. It's me or
every human that you love.

02:18.728 --> 02:21.664
What about your... your child?

02:21.666 --> 02:25.367
How do you know your unborn isn't a human?

02:25.369 --> 02:29.171
Think of the life you and
Morgan can have, do it for them.

02:30.439 --> 02:31.606
Come on.

02:32.875 --> 02:34.742
(YELLING) Do it, Jedikiah!

02:39.849 --> 02:41.416
Do it for me.

02:42.618 --> 02:43.785
Please.

02:45.221 --> 02:46.487
Do it for me.

02:59.468 --> 03:01.769
(ROGER GASPING)

03:01.771 --> 03:02.870
Argh!

03:08.176 --> 03:10.311
- Dad.

03:14.649 --> 03:17.251
It's wrong, no...

03:17.253 --> 03:18.518
(GROANING)

03:20.788 --> 03:22.789
- (GRUNTING)
- It's ok.

03:24.492 --> 03:26.192
(WHEEZING)

03:26.194 --> 03:29.596
(WEAKLY) It's ok.
Everything's going to be ok.

03:29.598 --> 03:30.597
(MILD SOBBING)

03:33.300 --> 03:34.568
The Machine.

03:35.837 --> 03:37.436
Why is it still charging?

03:37.438 --> 03:39.605
It's already got what
it needs from you, Roger.

03:40.875 --> 03:42.175
Your powers.

03:44.644 --> 03:47.213
This will be your legacy, Roger.

03:47.215 --> 03:50.683
Long after you've gone,
your powers will live on.

03:50.685 --> 03:52.718
Growing, expanding.

03:52.720 --> 03:54.587
Transforming the planet.

03:54.589 --> 03:56.121
(GASPING)

03:56.123 --> 03:58.557
And there's nothing you
can do to stop it, Stephen.

03:58.559 --> 04:01.927
Don't listen to him. It's over for me.

04:01.929 --> 04:03.685
But you can do this.

04:03.686 --> 04:06.226
You can save them, you can save humankind.

04:06.333 --> 04:08.266
(VOICE BREAKING) No, I'm not leaving you.

04:08.268 --> 04:10.067
Look at me.

04:10.069 --> 04:11.769
There's strength in you, son.

04:13.138 --> 04:15.072
Strength you can't imagine.

04:20.077 --> 04:21.980
Son, I believe in you.

04:23.215 --> 04:24.749
You have to go.

04:29.388 --> 04:31.389
(SNIFFLING AND BREATHING HEAVILY)

04:33.025 --> 04:34.025
Roger.

04:35.060 --> 04:37.328
No such escape for you, Jedikiah.

04:39.264 --> 04:41.165
Finish them.

04:41.167 --> 04:42.699
(WHISPERING) Hold on tight.

04:49.741 --> 04:51.727
Why didn't you teleport
us to a hospital, Roger?

04:51.728 --> 04:52.665
I could have saved you.

04:55.046 --> 04:58.048
(MEEKLY) I'm sorry. It's all my fault.

04:58.050 --> 05:00.383
- No.
- I knew our species couldn't exist together.

05:00.385 --> 05:02.952
And it's my fault.

05:02.954 --> 05:07.257
- (GASPING IN PAIN) Unless, Stephen can...
- Unite us.

05:07.259 --> 05:09.159
I like imagining that.

05:09.161 --> 05:10.693
(CONTINUES GASPING)

05:11.695 --> 05:13.696
(SOFTLY) Roger.

Roger.

05:21.838 --> 05:23.439
Roger. (SOFT SOBBING)

05:26.877 --> 05:28.177
Stephen.

05:29.179 --> 05:30.913
Hey, what happened?

05:32.082 --> 05:33.248
You ok?

05:34.750 --> 05:36.318
Where's Jedikiah?

05:37.320 --> 05:39.821
My father's dead, Jedikiah killed him.

05:44.827 --> 05:46.027
My God.

05:47.263 --> 05:49.297
(SNIFFLING)

05:59.141 --> 06:01.509
Stephen, I am so sorry.

06:01.511 --> 06:03.244
I couldn't save him.

06:04.880 --> 06:08.182
(VOICE BREAKING) I... I can stop
time but I couldn't save him.

06:08.184 --> 06:09.450
I was too late.

06:11.753 --> 06:14.255
My uncle shot him. He, uh...

06:14.257 --> 06:16.390
thought maybe it would stop the Machine.

06:18.360 --> 06:20.294
He was too... too late, too.

06:37.979 --> 06:40.193
What are you doing? You
know paranormals can't kill.

06:40.194 --> 06:41.014
He can.

06:41.049 --> 06:43.116
I'm not even one of you anymore.

06:43.118 --> 06:44.917
You were Annex, John. Why can't I be?

06:46.086 --> 06:47.720
A killer?

06:47.722 --> 06:50.290
You think... you think that's
what your dad would've wanted?

06:50.292 --> 06:52.459
None of this is what he wanted!

06:54.328 --> 06:57.263
John? Where's the facility?

06:57.265 --> 06:59.398
Where were you weaponized?

06:59.400 --> 07:00.432
(CHUCKLES UNCOMFORTABLY)

07:03.470 --> 07:05.138
We're not letting you do this.

07:11.711 --> 07:12.811
You already did.

07:13.846 --> 07:14.980
Hey.

07:16.883 --> 07:18.284
I'm sorry, Astrid.

07:21.954 --> 07:23.155
Stephen.

07:24.391 --> 07:27.259
Killing the Founder won't stop the Machine.

07:29.829 --> 07:32.130
- It won't save them.
- I know.

07:32.132 --> 07:34.733
Then why are you doing this?

07:34.735 --> 07:35.934
Revenge.

07:41.650 --> 07:48.354
- synced and corrected by chamallow -
- www.addic7ed.com -

07:53.059 --> 07:55.828
The Machine is akin to a nuclear reactor.

07:55.830 --> 07:58.998
<i>Only its fuel is
paranormal energy, Roger's.</i>

07:59.000 --> 08:02.134
Any idea of the affected radius
once the Machine goes nuclear?

08:02.136 --> 08:03.368
<i>TIM: Theoretically.</i>

08:06.539 --> 08:09.341
If I were human which, thank God, I'm not,

08:09.343 --> 08:12.210
I'd get as far away from the
Machine as humanly possible.

08:12.212 --> 08:14.212
Thanks, Tim.

08:14.214 --> 08:15.847
You heard him, John.

08:15.849 --> 08:17.916
You want me to run?

08:17.918 --> 08:20.084
I don't want you to die.

08:20.086 --> 08:22.987
And that is exactly what
will happen if you stay here.

08:22.989 --> 08:25.156
You have to get as far
from the city as you can.

08:25.158 --> 08:27.558
How? It's not like I can teleport.

08:27.560 --> 08:29.593
No passport, no car.

08:29.595 --> 08:31.462
What am I supposed to do? Hitchhike?

08:33.164 --> 08:35.999
It's like the whole world
got turned upside down.

08:36.001 --> 08:38.602
Now humans are the endangered species.

08:38.604 --> 08:40.003
And I'm one of them.

08:45.310 --> 08:46.644
What happened to us, Cara?

08:48.714 --> 08:50.180
What happened?

08:51.383 --> 08:53.050
I used to, I...

08:54.319 --> 08:57.054
I used to be able to hear your thoughts.

09:01.025 --> 09:02.993
Now, it's just... it's just silence.

09:06.530 --> 09:07.630
Feels empty.

09:12.936 --> 09:15.004
We are going to survive this.

09:17.140 --> 09:18.174
Together.

09:22.045 --> 09:26.515
I will find a way to stop the
Founder and then I will find you.

09:26.517 --> 09:28.050
I promise.

09:30.287 --> 09:31.988
And if you can't?

09:36.693 --> 09:38.594
If you won't save yourself...

09:39.696 --> 09:42.364
will you at least try and save Astrid?

09:59.215 --> 10:00.648
(SNIFFLING)

10:03.652 --> 10:06.054
Look, if this is about the Ducati,

10:06.056 --> 10:09.424
no one saw me teleport it, bro.

10:09.426 --> 10:12.560
Oh, and, uh, that thing that
happened in the VIP room.

10:12.562 --> 10:16.297
Who's gonna believe a bunch
of coked-out strippers. Right?

10:16.299 --> 10:19.199
You think this is about the humans?

10:19.201 --> 10:21.669
This is about the Tomorrow People. Bro.

10:25.407 --> 10:27.308
Ah, Russell. Thanks for coming.

10:29.377 --> 10:30.745
What are you doing here?

10:30.747 --> 10:32.980
They dragged me in here, same as you.

10:32.982 --> 10:35.682
Welcome, Russell, welcome.
This will only take a moment.

10:35.684 --> 10:37.051
Cara Coburn.

10:37.053 --> 10:38.618
Yeah, what about her?

10:38.620 --> 10:42.756
Well, I would like the two of
you to retrieve her from the Lair.

10:42.758 --> 10:46.026
That is what you call your
secret, little hovel, isn't it?

10:46.028 --> 10:47.527
(CHUCKLING)

10:47.529 --> 10:50.054
Look, uh, we already
brought you Stephen's dad.

10:50.055 --> 10:51.055
That was the deal.

10:52.233 --> 10:55.201
There are two million people
on this island, Russell.

10:56.236 --> 10:57.471
And tomorrow...

10:58.473 --> 11:00.406
it will all be ours.

11:00.408 --> 11:03.610
And if you want to be a part of that world.

11:03.612 --> 11:06.245
Then you will bring me your former leader.

11:06.247 --> 11:08.047
And those loyal to her.

11:08.049 --> 11:09.248
You mean Stephen?

11:11.485 --> 11:14.087
- What are you going to do to them?
- "Do to them?"

11:14.089 --> 11:18.291
Your friends will inherit this
brand new world right alongside us.

11:18.293 --> 11:19.692
But, of course.

11:19.694 --> 11:23.028
If they interfere with
us, at this late hour

11:24.598 --> 11:27.500
Why, then, Roger's sacrifice
will have been for nothing.

11:36.442 --> 11:39.211
<i>JEDIKIAH: (IN FILM) Hello,
John. What are you doing here?</i>

11:41.347 --> 11:43.348

my telekinesis, sir.</i>

11:43.350 --> 11:45.450
<i>JEDIKIAH: (IN FILM) Ok, what
did I tell you? It's Jed.</i>

11:45.452 --> 11:47.486
<i>Why don't you just call it a day, kiddo?</i>

11:47.488 --> 11:49.121

<i>ALL: (IN FILM) Happy Birthday!</i>

11:52.759 --> 11:54.659
<i>YOUNG JOHN: Thank you, guys.</i>

11:56.395 --> 11:57.762
You remember that day?

11:57.764 --> 11:59.631
You remember the present I got you?

11:59.633 --> 12:02.366
Of course I remember.

12:02.368 --> 12:07.371
Well, what you don't know is that,
that knife belonged to my granddad.

12:07.373 --> 12:10.574
And my granddad gave it to my
father and my father gave it to me.

12:10.576 --> 12:11.575
And, um...

12:13.078 --> 12:16.080
It would sound silly but I
wanted to keep it in the family.

12:17.349 --> 12:20.284
<i>YOUNG JOHN: It's cool. Thank you.</i>

12:23.555 --> 12:24.588
This one.

12:26.591 --> 12:27.691
You kept it.

12:29.393 --> 12:31.662
- Yeah.
- Well, you know, superstitions says

12:31.664 --> 12:34.665
it's bad luck to give a knife as a present.

12:34.667 --> 12:36.199
Severs relationships.

12:37.635 --> 12:40.537
Well, here then. I'm giving it back.

12:40.539 --> 12:43.373
Maybe it'll take back some of the bad luck.

12:44.675 --> 12:47.710
I wish I could take back
what I did to you, John.

12:47.712 --> 12:50.213
It was for nothing.

12:50.215 --> 12:53.616
Now, my brother's gone and
the world's gone to hell.

12:53.618 --> 12:57.153
- And here you are, watching old movies.
- Yes, indeed.

12:59.190 --> 13:00.990
You're, uh...

13:00.992 --> 13:02.324
you're all I have left.

13:04.160 --> 13:05.561
- You're...
- Human.

13:09.165 --> 13:11.567
I'm just a man, now, Jed.

13:11.569 --> 13:13.603
(SOFTLY) You're "just a man"?

13:15.105 --> 13:16.138
John.

13:18.674 --> 13:21.343
That is all a father
could want for his son.

13:44.734 --> 13:47.235
I'm sorry, all visitors
are supposed to che...

13:47.237 --> 13:48.903
Ugh!

13:48.905 --> 13:51.272
Delephonium-6, the drug you used
to Annex people, where is it?

14:02.618 --> 14:05.386
This was manufactured this month.

14:05.388 --> 14:06.520
Why?

14:06.522 --> 14:08.922
The Annex Project was shut down years ago.

14:08.924 --> 14:12.325
(STAMMERING) I just make the stuff.
I don't know why he needed it.

14:12.327 --> 14:13.560
Who?

14:13.562 --> 14:15.462
I never caught his real name.

14:17.231 --> 14:19.667
(SIGHING) He called himself...

14:22.003 --> 14:23.102
The Founder.

14:31.874 --> 14:33.173
Alright, we're almost there.

14:33.175 --> 14:34.540
Get ready to pull the cord.

14:36.209 --> 14:39.211
RUSSELL: (THINKING) You really
think we can trust these goons?

14:39.213 --> 14:43.115
I said, stop the train! Humans
gotta hoof it down to the Lair.

14:43.117 --> 14:45.718
Who you calling "human"?

14:45.720 --> 14:47.720
<i>(THINKING) And who are
you calling a "goon"?</i>

14:49.657 --> 14:51.791
A paranormal kill squad?

14:51.793 --> 14:53.793
What the hell did the Founder do?

14:57.898 --> 14:59.932
NATALIE: Cara? It's me.

15:01.101 --> 15:02.968
Russell and I made a huge mistake.

15:05.972 --> 15:07.572
How dare you come back here.

15:09.509 --> 15:11.643
Roger's blood is on your hands.

15:15.014 --> 15:16.014
So?

15:19.519 --> 15:20.852
RUSSELL: No!

15:24.156 --> 15:26.424
What are you doing? Murder
was not part of the deal.

15:29.661 --> 15:30.962
Cara, wait...

15:34.066 --> 15:35.834
You're on your own now, Russell.

15:47.879 --> 15:50.180
You're my world.

15:50.182 --> 15:53.217
You're my reason for
being and I'm humbled...

15:55.053 --> 15:56.854
To be back in this home.

15:56.856 --> 15:58.655
Let's all raise our glasses.

16:02.894 --> 16:04.161
Here's to family.

16:08.599 --> 16:09.833
(SNIFFLING)

16:20.544 --> 16:22.044
Don't try to stop me, Cara.

16:25.883 --> 16:27.116
I won't.

16:31.454 --> 16:33.489
What happened to you?

16:33.491 --> 16:37.994
Natalie lead a team of
agents down to the Lair.

16:37.996 --> 16:40.897
Only they've been mutated with
the same recombinant gene therapy

16:40.899 --> 16:42.731
you're about to take.

16:42.733 --> 16:46.468
His agents can kill. I
have to do this, Cara.

16:46.470 --> 16:48.886
The Founder took my family, my father,

16:48.887 --> 16:51.161
Hillary, he took everything from me!

16:51.876 --> 16:53.141
I'm still here.

16:56.880 --> 16:59.448
If we don't stop him, John,

16:59.450 --> 17:01.750
Astrid, Luca, they're all dead.

17:03.552 --> 17:04.986
I believe in you, Stephen.

17:06.622 --> 17:08.356
I have from the very start.

17:09.590 --> 17:11.626
The first time I heard your voice.

17:13.796 --> 17:14.930
I knew.

17:15.964 --> 17:17.999
Knew what?

17:18.001 --> 17:20.099
That you'd be the one to save all of us.

17:21.936 --> 17:23.438
How?

17:23.440 --> 17:25.873
It's not like this.

17:25.875 --> 17:27.875
Not by giving up your humanity.

17:40.555 --> 17:42.923
Come on. It's not safe here.

17:54.068 --> 17:55.836
Hey.

17:55.838 --> 17:58.839
Swung by the café. Saw that it was closed.

17:58.841 --> 18:00.907
My parents are on a cruise.

18:00.909 --> 18:03.743
It's their 25th, so they're probably

18:03.745 --> 18:05.912
sipping champagne and watching the sun set.

18:08.782 --> 18:10.783
Yeah.

18:10.785 --> 18:12.785
Maybe it's best, they don't know.

18:14.989 --> 18:17.991
- That the world's gonna end?
- Well, our world at least.

18:19.826 --> 18:21.861
Yeah.

18:21.863 --> 18:24.430
Who would've thought it
would happen on a Tuesday?

18:28.535 --> 18:30.870
But I'm glad you called.

18:30.872 --> 18:32.905
I didn't want to be alone when it happened.

18:35.976 --> 18:37.109
Me neither.

18:39.813 --> 18:41.113
But this isn't where we belong.

18:42.681 --> 18:43.748
Come on.

18:52.125 --> 18:55.127
I didn't know if there was some
kind of secret knock or something.

18:55.129 --> 18:58.162
- Didn't think you'd come.
- And let you steal all the glory?

19:00.132 --> 19:01.733
Of course, we came, dorkus.

19:04.069 --> 19:06.804
Not my fault. She didn't want to run.

19:06.806 --> 19:08.573
Look, we don't have much time.

19:08.575 --> 19:12.877
According to Jedikiah, the
Machine goes nuclear in two hours.

19:12.879 --> 19:15.012
Sorry, what does that mean?

19:15.014 --> 19:17.114
For them, nothing. For us...

19:17.116 --> 19:19.083
Time stops for each and every human.

19:20.652 --> 19:23.954
- It doesn't start again.
- Great. Then we better get moving.

19:23.956 --> 19:25.456
Anyone got a plan?

19:30.395 --> 19:31.862
STEPHEN: You son of a bitch!

19:31.864 --> 19:33.096
(RUSSELL GRUNTING)

19:33.098 --> 19:35.465
I didn't know your father would end up...

19:35.467 --> 19:37.100
I thought we were all going to die.

19:37.102 --> 19:39.970
I screwed up. I'm sorry.

19:39.972 --> 19:41.738
CARA: Stephen, Russell saved my life.

19:41.740 --> 19:44.474
He helped me escape
sent in his Annex agents.

19:47.844 --> 19:49.546
This doesn't make us even.

19:53.984 --> 19:56.119
RUSSELL: I know.

19:56.121 --> 19:57.720
I'll never make it right.

19:59.156 --> 20:00.890
But I can help stop the Machine.

20:02.726 --> 20:03.720
How?

20:03.721 --> 20:05.850
Roger had a plan. Before we sold him out.

20:05.863 --> 20:09.799
A way of taking the Founder down.

20:09.801 --> 20:13.603
Then again, it was designed
for a dozen of us, not three.

20:13.605 --> 20:16.672
- Three?
- Yeah, you know, there are five of us here.

20:16.674 --> 20:18.874
- I just thought...
- You just thought what?

20:18.876 --> 20:21.610
'Cause we don't have
powers, we can't fight?

20:21.612 --> 20:23.145
We're the ones fighting for our lives.

20:24.447 --> 20:26.081
Russell, we're listening.

20:36.124 --> 20:39.126
Founder's going to put every
goon he's got on the Machine.

20:39.128 --> 20:41.294
Yeah. No surprise, we're coming.

20:41.296 --> 20:45.065
But he's expecting us to
teleport in. Stealth mode, right?

20:45.067 --> 20:48.736
- Right, so if we're not sneaking in...
- We're storming the castle.

20:48.738 --> 20:49.803
Head on.

20:50.905 --> 20:53.640
Full frontal assault.

20:53.642 --> 20:56.309
We draw the Founder's agents outside Ultra.

20:57.778 --> 20:59.679
Distracting them.

20:59.681 --> 21:01.681
While someone sneaks in the Machine room.

21:01.683 --> 21:02.982
And destroys it.

21:03.984 --> 21:05.852
You?

21:05.854 --> 21:08.221
You had your shot. My turn now.

21:08.223 --> 21:10.790
Ok. Practical question.

21:10.792 --> 21:12.992
If we're going to attack and
office building in broad daylight,

21:12.994 --> 21:15.228
don't you think someone's
going to see us? Like cops?

21:15.230 --> 21:17.296
Cops will be dead in two hours.

21:17.298 --> 21:19.376
Yeah. Along with me, and John,

21:19.377 --> 21:21.167
and every human that's caught in the blast.

21:21.236 --> 21:23.669
- I'm not going to let that happen.
- Neither am I.

21:25.105 --> 21:27.573
Ok, who's up for saving the world?

21:35.815 --> 21:37.983
It looks like Ultra's
cordoned off the block

21:37.985 --> 21:39.752
to keep out any unwanted guests.

21:39.754 --> 21:42.621
Man, our ass is going to be
hanging out in the breeze.

21:42.623 --> 21:44.656
Not having second thoughts, are you?

21:44.658 --> 21:46.758
(CHUCKLING) Nah, I got a great ass.

21:50.296 --> 21:53.531
- No matter what happens...
- I stay put until you guys draw their fire.

21:53.533 --> 21:54.599
Right.

21:57.804 --> 22:02.973
You know what, I'm going to go
do some pre-fight calisthenics.

22:07.680 --> 22:09.213
Don't really know what to say.

Alright. I got it.

23:49.613 --> 23:50.912
Uh, are you sure?

23:50.914 --> 23:52.914
Yeah. Split up, maximum chaos.

24:06.328 --> 24:07.895
Ah, Cara.

24:07.897 --> 24:11.532
I'd knew you'd find
your way here eventually.

24:11.534 --> 24:15.502
The Founder has offered us the world and
you want to just hand it back to the humans?

24:15.504 --> 24:17.604
Look. (EXHALING)

24:17.606 --> 24:22.476
I've made some major mistakes
in my life, but mass extinction?

you turned her into a lab rat?

- Don't mention my daughter.

24:53.674 --> 24:56.976

for some lunatic genocide.

the planet, as it should be.

Don't you understand, Stephen,
that human extinction is inevitable.

But rather than thousands of years
of slow decay and obsolescence

27:36.425 --> 27:40.059

in the blink of an eye.

Don't you want your old life back again?

34:35.553 --> 34:37.752
Don't you want Cara back again?

34:37.754 --> 34:39.420
(EXHALING)

34:39.422 --> 34:42.757
You stole Irene's powers and
now you want to give them to me.

34:42.759 --> 34:45.994
Oh, I don't think you
understand something. It's not...

34:45.996 --> 34:49.563
Irene's DNA that I'm offering you, son.

34:50.599 --> 34:52.000
It's Roger's.

34:53.034 --> 34:54.134
No.

34:55.771 --> 34:58.973
No. Tell me you didn't.

34:58.975 --> 35:01.008
Roger was dead, his body was dead.

35:02.043 --> 35:03.878
But I've made him immortal.

35:07.215 --> 35:08.683
Why are you doing this?

35:08.685 --> 35:10.684
John, I'm offering you my blood.

35:10.686 --> 35:12.111
I'm offering you my brother,

35:12.112 --> 35:15.095
the most precious part of him
so that he can live on in you.

35:16.092 --> 35:18.959
I thought all any father wanted
was for his son to be a man.

35:18.961 --> 35:21.228
But what if you can be something more?

35:30.571 --> 35:32.238
She doesn't know?

35:32.240 --> 35:34.641
- He doesn't know? She doesn't know?
- Well, ok.

35:34.643 --> 35:36.275
(BOTH LAUGHING)

35:36.277 --> 35:39.212
I mean do you... do you have
any idea how laid you could get?

35:39.214 --> 35:41.247
You saved all of their lives.

35:42.749 --> 35:44.950
- Even her?
- Yeah? You figure I got a shot?

35:44.952 --> 35:46.819
No. No.

35:46.821 --> 35:49.855
I don't think anyone would think a
dork like you could save the world.

35:49.857 --> 35:52.158
Oh, thanks for that. Way to tame my ego.

35:52.160 --> 35:53.826
(LAUGHING) Yeah, that's why I'm here.

35:55.195 --> 35:56.962
Let's get some food.

35:56.964 --> 35:59.231
- Some dumplings, a little Shu Mai?
- Mm-hmm.

35:59.233 --> 36:00.566
<i>CARA: Stephen?</i>

36:00.568 --> 36:01.901
You better get down here.

36:03.803 --> 36:06.972
Oh. You're doing your weird telepathy face.

36:06.974 --> 36:10.075
- It's Cara. Ok? I gotta go.
- Ok.

36:10.077 --> 36:12.912
- Hey, if you see John...
- I will tell him you're looking.

36:14.047 --> 36:15.713
For Love. Aw, aw!

36:24.023 --> 36:25.290
(EXHALING)

36:28.894 --> 36:30.095
Who are they?

36:31.230 --> 36:32.730
Breakouts.

36:34.199 --> 36:36.935
Who found all of them?

36:36.937 --> 36:39.604
They found us.

36:39.606 --> 36:40.629
Whatever you did at Ultra,

36:40.630 --> 36:42.908
sent up some sort of
telepathic homing beacon.

36:43.276 --> 36:44.308
<i>♪</i>

36:45.778 --> 36:47.679
They're from all over, Stephen.

36:49.214 --> 36:50.614
And they keep coming.

36:53.051 --> 36:54.218
STEPHEN: That's great.

36:55.287 --> 36:57.254
Why are they all staring at me?

36:59.791 --> 37:02.193
Because you're their leader.

37:02.195 --> 37:03.594
They're here for you.

37:11.769 --> 37:12.769
No.

37:13.938 --> 37:15.005
They're here for us.

37:26.083 --> 37:27.883
For us.

37:27.885 --> 37:28.951
For us.

37:30.821 --> 37:32.255
It's good to have you back, Russell.

37:32.257 --> 37:34.124
- Really?
- Really.

37:40.097 --> 37:41.931
We're gonna need a bigger Lair.

37:54.544 --> 37:56.145
CARA: This is insane, Stephen.

37:56.147 --> 37:59.148
It's temporary. Until we find a new Lair.

37:59.150 --> 38:00.882
Get some, bitch!

38:00.884 --> 38:01.999
STEPHEN: It's perfect.

38:02.000 --> 38:03.979
The place that hunted them is now a haven.

38:04.721 --> 38:06.142
And what about the people
who used to work here?

38:06.143 --> 38:08.733
Well. The Founder's gone.

38:08.892 --> 38:10.892
Natalie and her gang are AWOL.

38:10.894 --> 38:13.928
Our future is only as
small as our imagination.

38:13.930 --> 38:15.664
- I like that.
- Thanks.

38:15.666 --> 38:17.799
I got it from a fortune cookie.

38:17.801 --> 38:20.535
You the lamest Chosen One ever.

38:20.537 --> 38:21.903
"Ever"?

38:21.905 --> 38:23.538
What about Jedikiah?

38:24.640 --> 38:26.507
Still haven't heard from him?

38:31.880 --> 38:33.781
You know you want to try it.

38:34.949 --> 38:37.218
(EXHALING) No.

38:37.220 --> 38:38.252
"No"?

38:39.521 --> 38:41.222
Well, if you'd like to, please.

38:51.766 --> 38:53.200
How is it?

38:53.202 --> 38:55.569
It's pretty damn good, actually.

38:55.571 --> 38:57.738
(CHUCKLING) Ok, get up. My turn.

38:57.740 --> 38:59.573
- No.
- Ok. Get up.

38:59.575 --> 39:01.675
(BOTH GIGGLING)

39:01.677 --> 39:04.043
- Oh!
- (BOTH LAUGHING)

39:05.913 --> 39:08.181
Yeah, yeah. I could get used to this.

39:12.119 --> 39:13.220
What is it?

39:17.624 --> 39:20.559
Ever since that day,
nothing's felt the same.

39:22.596 --> 39:23.796
I haven't felt the same.

39:29.870 --> 39:31.204
I can still feel it.

39:34.841 --> 39:36.174
Stephen, what did you do?

39:41.848 --> 39:44.783
If I told you, you wouldn't believe me.

39:46.886 --> 39:49.087
(SCREAMING) Cara!

39:53.292 --> 39:55.560
What's wrong?

39:55.562 --> 39:56.762
I felt John.

39:58.998 --> 40:01.666
I felt like he was breaking out.

40:01.668 --> 40:02.801
That's impossible.

40:13.979 --> 40:16.080
Dr. Price.

40:16.082 --> 40:19.850
- How did you get in here?
- I teleported.

40:19.852 --> 40:23.654
- (SCOFFING) I'm calling security.
- Oh, no.

40:23.656 --> 40:24.855
Uh, don't do that.

40:26.258 --> 40:27.691
Please, sit, Senator.

40:30.028 --> 40:32.129
If this is about Ultra...

40:32.131 --> 40:36.267
Oh, no, I'm not here rattling
the can for grant money.

40:36.269 --> 40:39.003
No, I want to start a new organization.

40:40.772 --> 40:41.871
Partnership.

40:42.873 --> 40:45.141
With whom?

40:45.143 --> 40:52.148
What branch of defense or intelligence
wouldn't want a paranormal super-soldier?

40:52.150 --> 40:56.052
That's right, last time we talked about
this, you had me thrown in a rubber room.

40:57.121 --> 40:59.989
Which is why I brought one with me.

40:59.991 --> 41:03.059
Senator Kelsey, meet John
Young. My first prototype.

41:03.061 --> 41:05.895
Nice to meet you, Senator.

41:05.897 --> 41:08.531
JEDIKIAH: So, let's get down
to brass tacks, shall we?

41:08.533 --> 41:10.800
Who are your contacts at the Pentagon?

41:18.709 --> 41:20.543
Well, that went well.

41:22.579 --> 41:24.112
What's this?

41:24.114 --> 41:25.247
Our next mission.

41:33.556 --> 41:35.622
You recognize her?

41:35.624 --> 41:36.891
Am I supposed to?

41:40.829 --> 41:43.297
What do you want with her?

41:43.299 --> 41:46.600
Well, if this little endeavor of
ours is supposed to work, we, uh...

41:46.602 --> 41:48.169
We need recruits with your skillset.

41:50.538 --> 41:51.872
She's our first recruit.

41:54.175 --> 41:55.743
First of many.

41:57.111 --> 41:58.311
First of many.
