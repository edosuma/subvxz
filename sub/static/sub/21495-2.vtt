(man speaking over radio
in Romanian)

00:11.979 --> 00:12.913

00:12.980 --> 00:15.283

00:31.932 --> 00:35.569
Gabriel, enough with the radio.

00:35.636 --> 00:39.273
We're surrounded by the
beautiful Romanian landscape--

00:39.340 --> 00:40.974
why disturb it with noise?

00:41.041 --> 00:42.143
What do you mean "why?"

00:42.210 --> 00:43.144
The great Nadia Comaneci

00:43.211 --> 00:46.347
is about to
perform her floor routine.

00:46.414 --> 00:48.449
-"Why?"
-(banging on radio)

00:51.585 --> 00:54.455
Gabriel, leave the radio,
get your gun.

01:14.308 --> 01:16.677
(engine turns off)

01:16.744 --> 01:18.746
(parking brake cranks)

01:21.882 --> 01:23.451
Papers.

01:24.585 --> 01:26.487
(clears throat)

01:27.788 --> 01:28.756
(clears throat)

01:37.198 --> 01:39.633
Our radio's broken,

01:39.700 --> 01:41.902
and my friend would like
to hear Nadia Comaneci

01:41.969 --> 01:43.837
perform her floor routine.

01:43.904 --> 01:45.639
Think we can try yours?

01:45.706 --> 01:47.575
Radio doesn't work.

01:47.641 --> 01:49.810
This is a Dacia,
best car in the world.

01:49.877 --> 01:52.146
Shouldn't it have
the best radio in the world?

01:52.213 --> 01:55.383
-(clears throat)
-Here, let me try.

01:56.717 --> 01:58.419
ANNOUNCER (over radio):
And right now, the crowd...

01:58.486 --> 02:01.655
Hey, hey!
Gabriel, you're in luck.

02:01.722 --> 02:03.123
-I really got to get going.
-ANNOUNCER: Tournament favorite,

02:03.191 --> 02:04.525
Nadia Comaneci!

02:04.592 --> 02:07.828
And I really need you
to open up your trunk.

02:22.376 --> 02:24.512
Gabriel, come take a look.

02:28.549 --> 02:30.318
Oh, boy.

02:30.384 --> 02:32.986
Looks to me like a bribe.

02:33.053 --> 02:36.557
VASILE: I'm guessing if I were
to lift up this blanket,

02:36.624 --> 02:38.659
I would find a trunkful of soap.

02:38.726 --> 02:42.263
Soap you intend to sell
on the black market,

02:42.330 --> 02:45.766
like some capitalist pig.

02:45.833 --> 02:50.604
Now, if we were to take
these bars of soap,

02:50.671 --> 02:53.874
perhaps we would not
lift up the blanket.

02:55.943 --> 02:57.211
No, we would be so grateful

02:57.278 --> 02:58.646
to bring them home
to our wives,

02:58.712 --> 03:00.914
we would forget this
whole thing ever happened.

03:00.981 --> 03:03.083
(laughs)

03:03.150 --> 03:05.353
Uh...

03:05.419 --> 03:07.788
but unfortunately for you,
I'm a widower.

03:07.855 --> 03:10.891
And, alas,
Gabriel only has eyes

03:10.958 --> 03:12.926
for Miss Nadia Comaneci.

03:12.993 --> 03:15.896
But this is beside the point.

03:15.963 --> 03:19.533
And what, exactly, is the point?

03:19.600 --> 03:23.637
The point is
we are good communists,

03:23.704 --> 03:27.140
and we will not stand for this

03:27.207 --> 03:30.010
Mickey Mouse bullshit.

03:30.077 --> 03:32.513
So let's have a look, shall we?

03:35.082 --> 03:37.050
Hey! Hey, stop!

03:37.117 --> 03:39.052
Stop, or I'll shoot!

03:39.119 --> 03:40.254
(gun cocks)

03:40.321 --> 03:42.956
-(beeping)
-Fuck it!

03:43.023 --> 03:44.358
Gabriel!
Gabriel!

03:56.837 --> 03:57.905
(grunts)

03:57.971 --> 03:59.940
(truck horn honking)

04:01.208 --> 04:03.411
(horn honks)

04:06.347 --> 04:07.715
(machine gun firing)

04:24.998 --> 04:27.835
Hey, uh, whoa, whoa, whoa.
What are you doing?

04:27.901 --> 04:29.403
Hmm?

04:29.470 --> 04:32.540
I'm checking his prostate.

04:32.606 --> 04:34.207
No, I'm getting his prints.

04:34.274 --> 04:35.909
Okay, I need to know
who this man is.

04:35.976 --> 04:37.811
And like I told you before,
Detective, as soon as

04:37.878 --> 04:39.413
the patient has recovered,
we will gladly

04:39.480 --> 04:40.748
hand him over to the police,

04:40.814 --> 04:42.783
but right now,
he needs some rest, okay?

04:42.850 --> 04:45.319
And if he doesn't recover?
Hmm?

04:45.386 --> 04:47.020
We never get a chance
to talk to him,

04:47.087 --> 04:48.622
and then my partner's killer
goes free.

04:48.689 --> 04:50.424
Of course he's gonna recover,
he's receiving

04:50.491 --> 04:53.361
the best health care in
the entire world. Now, get out.

04:55.429 --> 04:58.466
GREGOR:
See you in a minute, fuck face.

05:08.576 --> 05:11.178
(drill whirs)

05:11.244 --> 05:13.280
(sighs)

05:13.347 --> 05:15.383
Sorry, Detective.

05:15.449 --> 05:18.486
Just a whole lot
of nothing here.

05:20.120 --> 05:23.123
No dice.
Whole car's clean.

05:23.190 --> 05:25.759
All right, wrap it up.

05:27.127 --> 05:29.563
(drill whirs)

05:36.937 --> 05:38.305
Hold on.

05:38.372 --> 05:40.073
OFFICER:
What you got?

05:40.140 --> 05:41.942
This is an '81 Dacia.

05:42.009 --> 05:45.345
The '81 Dacia
has white stitching, not red.

05:46.747 --> 05:49.783
This has been re-sewn.

05:53.787 --> 05:54.988
Hold this.

05:57.157 --> 05:59.359
(stitching ripping)

06:25.519 --> 06:27.521
-(knife clicks)
-What the fuck is that?

06:28.556 --> 06:30.357
(chuckles)

06:30.424 --> 06:34.327
(box rattles)

06:34.394 --> 06:36.697
♪ ♪

06:42.736 --> 06:45.439
-Did you get a name?
-No, he's sleeping.

06:47.140 --> 06:48.408
Got his prints, though.

06:48.476 --> 06:50.544
I'll forward them to the lab.

06:50.611 --> 06:53.313
What'd you find?

06:53.380 --> 06:55.983
This. Any idea what it is?

07:02.422 --> 07:04.792
"Mono-poly."

07:19.473 --> 07:21.509
Um, excuse me?

07:21.575 --> 07:23.443
Stan, what happens to killers

07:23.511 --> 07:25.679
who aren't caught
in the first 48 hours?

07:25.746 --> 07:28.882
Well, Dragos,
they almost always get away.

07:28.949 --> 07:30.984
(laughs)

07:32.385 --> 07:33.554
Bravo.

07:33.621 --> 07:34.855
Perhaps it would be
more fruitful

07:34.922 --> 07:37.290
to offer help,
rather than criticism.

07:37.357 --> 07:40.594
Humor me, Detectives, have you
ever seen anything like this?

07:40.661 --> 07:42.863
This? "Mono-poly."

07:42.930 --> 07:45.198
-Monopoly.
-It's Western.

07:45.265 --> 07:47.635
Ha! No shit, genius.

07:47.701 --> 07:48.669
-Ow!
-Fuck you, man.

07:48.736 --> 07:50.571
-Fuck you! -You fucking ginger.
-Hey, hey!

07:50.638 --> 07:52.540
Hey, yeah, we get that
it's from the West,

07:52.606 --> 07:54.174
b-but what is it?

07:54.241 --> 07:56.844
You ruined my jacket.

07:56.910 --> 07:58.646
Don't ask us, ask Anghel.

07:58.712 --> 08:01.915
He knows all about the West.

08:01.982 --> 08:02.916
Right, Anghel?

08:02.983 --> 08:04.317
Yeah, he could teach a class.

08:04.384 --> 08:05.218
(chuckles)

08:05.285 --> 08:07.521
MAN (nearby):
He's gonna rat on his cousin?

08:07.588 --> 08:09.957
Oh, I'm sorry.

08:10.023 --> 08:11.424
You didn't tell
your new partner?

08:11.491 --> 08:13.426
Well, you should ask Gregor

08:13.493 --> 08:14.628
about his very first bust.

08:14.695 --> 08:16.429
DRAGOS:
Yeah, Anghel here

08:16.496 --> 08:18.866
is quite a detective,
always has been.

08:21.401 --> 08:23.236
Here.

08:29.242 --> 08:30.811
What was that all about?

08:34.514 --> 08:38.184
I may know some people
who can help us out with this.

08:38.251 --> 08:41.722
(scoffs)
Then what are we waiting for?

08:41.789 --> 08:44.658
It's not that simple.

08:44.725 --> 08:47.861
(thunder rumbles)

08:47.928 --> 08:49.997
GREGOR: Look there's something
you should know

08:50.063 --> 08:53.266
about these people
we're about to talk to.

08:53.333 --> 08:54.434
They're dangerous.

08:54.501 --> 08:55.636
I'm a detective, Gregor.

08:55.703 --> 08:57.204
I deal in danger for a living.

08:57.270 --> 09:00.774
No, not like this.

09:00.841 --> 09:05.345
These two may seem harmless,
but make no mistake,

09:05.412 --> 09:07.514
they're devious.

09:07.581 --> 09:10.584
I know better than anyone.

09:10.651 --> 09:12.820
(door opens)

09:22.796 --> 09:24.932
(handcuffs loosen)

09:35.508 --> 09:37.310
OLD MAN:
Hello, Gregor.

09:39.246 --> 09:41.348
It's nice to see you.

09:41.414 --> 09:44.084
You look well.

09:46.720 --> 09:49.690
This is my new partner, Joseph.

09:53.694 --> 09:56.163
We need your help.

09:56.229 --> 09:58.832
What is this?

09:58.899 --> 10:00.634
(thunder rumbles)

10:00.701 --> 10:03.136
It's a Western game.

10:03.203 --> 10:05.739
After the financial collapse
of America,

10:05.806 --> 10:08.175
the Great Depression of 1929,

10:08.241 --> 10:10.343
the populace began to lose faith
in their capitalist system.

10:10.410 --> 10:14.782
So they invented this game
to rebuild trust.

10:14.848 --> 10:17.184
It's calledMonopoly.

10:17.250 --> 10:18.886
And how do you play?

10:18.952 --> 10:22.289
So, each rectangle
represents a piece of property.

10:22.355 --> 10:25.392
The object of the game
is to purchase the property,

10:25.458 --> 10:29.129
and hope your opponent lands
on the property that you own.

10:29.196 --> 10:31.999
-Why? -WOMAN: That way,
they pay you rent.

10:32.065 --> 10:35.535
The more rent you get paid,
the more money you make.

10:35.602 --> 10:37.938
More properties you purchase.

10:38.005 --> 10:40.440
And when your opponents
have no money left,

10:40.507 --> 10:42.142
and are completely in your debt,

10:42.209 --> 10:44.945
then, and only then,
do you win the game.

10:45.012 --> 10:48.081
You're telling me
that the purpose of this game

10:48.148 --> 10:50.217
is to drive your fellow citizens
into poverty,

10:50.283 --> 10:53.320
-so that you may get rich?
-(both chuckle)

10:53.386 --> 10:55.255
It's diabolical.

10:55.322 --> 10:56.690
It's just a game.

10:56.757 --> 10:59.626
Nowadays, the West finds it
as a useful tool

10:59.693 --> 11:04.131
to indoctrinate young children
into the capitalist system.

11:06.366 --> 11:09.269
(thunder rumbles)

11:11.538 --> 11:14.674
How are you, Gregor?

11:17.878 --> 11:21.815
You lost the right
to ask me that...

11:21.882 --> 11:25.018
when you conspired
against the state, Mommy.

11:26.854 --> 11:28.856
OLD MAN:
We were foolish, son.

11:28.922 --> 11:30.357
As intellectuals,

11:30.423 --> 11:33.293
our minds naturally
lent themselves to curiosity.

11:33.360 --> 11:36.363
And that curiosity
led us astray. We were weak.

11:38.966 --> 11:40.467
You had your trial.

11:40.533 --> 11:42.402
And I won't try your case again.

11:43.503 --> 11:45.405
Thanks for your help, Pop.

11:46.473 --> 11:47.474
See you guys later.

11:52.645 --> 11:54.447
(door opens)

11:59.219 --> 12:01.154
(door closes)

12:25.478 --> 12:26.914
(door clicks)

12:27.848 --> 12:30.017
(door opens)

12:44.531 --> 12:48.068
(thunder rumbles)

12:48.135 --> 12:52.172
Your parents are subversives.

12:52.239 --> 12:55.108
That can't be easy on you.

12:55.175 --> 12:58.578
They used to be great parents.

12:58.645 --> 13:01.681
Model communists. The best.

13:01.748 --> 13:04.818
So much so that they were tasked

13:04.885 --> 13:07.720
with becoming cultural attaches
to the West.

13:07.787 --> 13:10.357
(opera music playing)

13:10.423 --> 13:11.992
They hid it well.

13:12.059 --> 13:15.295
But they couldn't hide it
from me.

13:17.865 --> 13:20.167
I was only 12,
but even at that age,

13:20.233 --> 13:24.404
I noticed their lust
for materialism.

13:24.471 --> 13:26.907
It made them crazy.

13:32.079 --> 13:36.316
So I did my duty,
and I turned them in.

13:46.326 --> 13:50.330
I became the lead witness
for the prosecution.

13:50.397 --> 13:52.665
I saw it all.

13:52.732 --> 13:54.001
Everything.

13:56.403 --> 13:59.572
It was my testimony
that put them away.

14:05.612 --> 14:09.449
I have an uncle, Pavel,
who was seduced by the West.

14:09.516 --> 14:10.951
He fled to America.

14:11.018 --> 14:13.853
Needless to say,
things did not end well.

14:13.921 --> 14:18.558
He was forced to start his
own business just to survive.

14:18.625 --> 14:21.861
He opened a car wash.

14:23.931 --> 14:25.565
What the fuck is a car wash?

14:25.632 --> 14:27.400
Yeah, Americans are so lazy,

14:27.467 --> 14:29.602
they can't be bothered
to wash their own cars.

14:29.669 --> 14:33.873
-What? -They exploit the poor
to do it for them.

14:33.941 --> 14:36.576
And soon, one car wash
wasn't enough.

14:36.643 --> 14:37.877
He opened another.

14:37.945 --> 14:39.212
And another.

14:39.279 --> 14:41.414
How can a man be a father
or a husband

14:41.481 --> 14:44.451
when he only thinks
about work and money?

14:47.520 --> 14:49.822
His marriage fell apart.

14:49.889 --> 14:51.925
His children turned to drugs.

14:51.992 --> 14:55.262
He's a shell of the man he was.

14:55.328 --> 14:57.597
Tragic.

14:57.664 --> 15:02.936
You did the right thing
turning your parents in, Gregor.

15:03.003 --> 15:05.372
Think what other fate
could've befallen them.

15:11.945 --> 15:16.316
Gregor, when is the last time
you had a home-cooked meal?

15:24.091 --> 15:27.294
(streetcar bells ringing)

15:27.360 --> 15:30.197
GREGOR:
One, two, three, yeah.

15:30.263 --> 15:32.532
I was working for
the secret police at the time,

15:32.599 --> 15:34.767
and her file
came across my desk.

15:34.834 --> 15:36.636
Clean, of course.

15:36.703 --> 15:40.573
But I saw her picture, and I
couldn't get her out of my head.

15:40.640 --> 15:43.810
I almost arrested her
just so I could meet her.

15:43.876 --> 15:45.145
(chuckles)

15:45.212 --> 15:46.946
Then I saw her
walking through town,

15:47.014 --> 15:49.116

the courage to talk to her.

15:52.019 --> 15:53.653
we were married.

15:55.388 --> 15:57.424

Bucharest?

15:57.490 --> 15:58.958
It smells funny.

15:59.026 --> 16:00.160
Andrei.

16:00.227 --> 16:02.829
What, Papa? It does.

16:02.895 --> 16:05.132
FLAVIA:
I think it's amazing.

16:05.198 --> 16:06.899
There's so much to do.

16:06.966 --> 16:09.769
Theatre, museums, concerts,

16:09.836 --> 16:11.604
the hospitals.

16:11.671 --> 16:13.373
Hmm.

16:13.440 --> 16:15.008
And you, Sonya?

16:15.075 --> 16:16.709
-How about you?
-I'm...

16:16.776 --> 16:18.378
getting used to it.

16:18.445 --> 16:22.349
Bucharest is one of the most
modern cities in the world.

16:22.415 --> 16:24.617
I'm just a simple milkmaid.
(chuckles)

16:24.684 --> 16:27.954
I don't know what to make
of this gas stove,

16:28.021 --> 16:30.223
and all this electricity.

16:30.290 --> 16:32.259
My goodness, at home,
we'd cook over a wood fire,

16:32.325 --> 16:33.860
and read
by the light of the stars.

16:33.926 --> 16:37.064
Don't worry, we'll make
a city girl out of you yet.

16:37.130 --> 16:39.399
(both laugh)

16:39.466 --> 16:41.201
(sighs)

16:41.268 --> 16:43.703
Well, you saved me the job
of doing dishes,

16:43.770 --> 16:45.372
you cleaned your plates.

16:45.438 --> 16:48.341
Yeah, well, I've never had
such delicious tripe soup.

16:48.408 --> 16:50.310
-Thank you.
-Thank you. Come on, kids.

16:50.377 --> 16:52.312
Thanks.

16:53.646 --> 16:56.783
You have a beautiful family,
Joseph.

16:56.849 --> 16:57.817
Thanks.

16:57.884 --> 17:01.254
They are the light of my life.

17:01.321 --> 17:04.457
Listen, I've been thinking.

17:11.931 --> 17:13.566
You look here.

17:13.633 --> 17:18.305
Some of the properties
on the board have been X'd out.

17:18.371 --> 17:23.009
Park Place, Kentucky Avenue,
New York Avenue.

17:23.076 --> 17:26.713
And Boardwalk.

17:26.779 --> 17:28.848
Maybe it's part of the game.

17:28.915 --> 17:31.818
No, it's something else.

17:31.884 --> 17:35.822
If this suspect is a smuggler,

17:35.888 --> 17:37.590
why just one game?

17:37.657 --> 17:40.860
Shouldn't his car
be full of these games?

17:40.927 --> 17:42.729
Maybe it's personal use.

17:42.795 --> 17:45.765
He, you know, he's getting high
on his own supply, so to speak.

17:45.832 --> 17:48.535
-Mm, no.

17:48.601 --> 17:51.638

this is just the beginning.

Uh, I'm drunk, you got to drive.

18:25.438 --> 18:27.374
GREGOR:
Ivan Blaga, 49.

18:27.440 --> 18:30.443
He's, uh, got a rap sheet
a kilometer long.

18:30.510 --> 18:32.912
Burglary, trespassing,
sexual assault,

18:32.979 --> 18:34.080
conspiring against the state.

18:34.147 --> 18:35.682
It just doesn't make sense.

18:35.748 --> 18:41.288
How does a two-bit scumbag like
this own a lakeside summer home?

18:41.354 --> 18:43.223
Dirty money.

18:43.290 --> 18:46.759
He's just lucky the state
hasn't picked up on it.

18:46.826 --> 18:49.862
Ah, I don't believe someone
just gets lucky like that,

18:49.929 --> 18:51.198
and the state's too thorough.

18:51.264 --> 18:53.099

-Yeah, I know it's a game.

in your car?

21:58.184 --> 22:00.853

Okay, let me totally clear
with you guys.

22:58.611 --> 23:02.281
This is a hospital,
not an interrogation room.

23:02.348 --> 23:03.783

And you will,
as soon as we discharge him.

When will he be discharged?

of a trial.

24:25.464 --> 24:27.133
What is it?

29:53.559 --> 29:57.196
(pounding on door)

29:57.263 --> 29:58.831
I'm sorry to barge in
like this, Sonya,

29:58.898 --> 30:00.399
but I need to speak to Joseph.

30:00.466 --> 30:02.634
Gregor, what is it?

30:02.701 --> 30:06.672
Outside my apartment, they were
just handing these jeans out

30:06.738 --> 30:08.174
in plain sight.

30:08.240 --> 30:11.077
And the women. The women,
Joseph, they were going crazy.

30:11.143 --> 30:12.778
-I mean, crazy.
-Well, what does it mean?

30:12.845 --> 30:14.180
You were right.

30:14.246 --> 30:16.682
I don't think
that we've got Nikita's killer.

30:16.748 --> 30:19.785
I think this whole thing
is bigger than we thought.

30:19.852 --> 30:21.353
Wait, wait, wait, no.
Convince me.

30:21.420 --> 30:24.223
If Ivan wasn't guilty,
why'd he kill himself?

30:24.290 --> 30:27.293
How do we get suspects to talk,
Joseph?

30:27.359 --> 30:29.061
We torture them.

30:29.128 --> 30:31.630
So Ivan was afraid
of being tortured.

30:31.697 --> 30:32.798
What's your point?

30:32.865 --> 30:34.533
Why do we torture them?

30:34.600 --> 30:36.102
'Cause it works.

30:36.168 --> 30:37.569
Ivan wasn't afraid
of being tortured,

30:37.636 --> 30:38.737
he was afraid of confessing.

30:38.804 --> 30:40.272
Because if he confessed,

30:40.339 --> 30:42.608
then he would've told us
what we already know deep down.

30:42.674 --> 30:45.311
-That Ivan didn't kill Nikita.
-Exactly.

30:45.377 --> 30:48.114
The killer's still out there.

30:48.180 --> 30:50.516
Ivan was a patsy, he was
a fall guy. Now, now, think.

30:50.582 --> 30:52.618
Who led us to Ivan
in the first place?

30:52.684 --> 30:55.487
Who was the very first suspect?

30:55.554 --> 30:57.289
The U.S. ambassador.

30:58.824 --> 31:00.359
We're such fools.

31:00.426 --> 31:02.828
She led us
on a wild-goose chase.

31:02.895 --> 31:04.663
She took the suspicion
off herself

31:04.730 --> 31:05.965
and framed a two-bit crook.

31:06.032 --> 31:08.267
-She played us, Joseph.
-(screams)

31:08.334 --> 31:10.069
(Sonya gasping)

31:10.136 --> 31:11.870
JOSEPH:
Flavia.

31:11.938 --> 31:13.940
Flavia, put those down.

31:14.006 --> 31:15.707
-SONYA: Go to your room!
-But Mom...

31:15.774 --> 31:17.509
I said go to your room!

31:17.576 --> 31:19.211
(Flavia groans)

31:24.083 --> 31:26.618
You find the men
responsible for this.

31:26.685 --> 31:30.522
Find this man,
and bring him to justice.

31:39.665 --> 31:42.534
"Jordache."

31:42.601 --> 31:45.504
Jordache.

31:47.206 --> 31:50.042
Let's go to the embassy.

31:52.611 --> 31:54.546
Ambassador!

31:55.614 --> 31:57.916
We're here
to see the ambassador.

31:57.984 --> 32:00.953
(winded):
I'm afraid you're too late.

32:01.020 --> 32:03.155
(sniffles)

32:12.798 --> 32:14.733
JOSEPH:
When did you find her?

32:14.800 --> 32:16.035
(sniffles)

32:16.102 --> 32:19.638
(crying):
A half hour ago.

32:19.705 --> 32:21.940
(crying)

32:23.142 --> 32:25.344
No. Gregor, don't.

32:25.411 --> 32:29.048
She's been poisoned,
by the money.

32:34.453 --> 32:35.487
Huh.

32:39.025 --> 32:42.128
Our killer has a sense of humor.

32:51.103 --> 32:52.971
MAN: We'll just have to
mark the area.

32:58.110 --> 32:59.845
I don't think the secretary
knows anything,

32:59.911 --> 33:02.381
and even if she did,
we couldn't question her.

33:02.448 --> 33:05.551
I've never seen
anything like this, Gregor.

33:05.617 --> 33:07.686
What do we do now?

33:07.753 --> 33:09.555
We're workers.

33:09.621 --> 33:11.123

might've spotted us,

34:52.491 --> 34:54.960
but we got out of there quick.

34:55.025 --> 34:57.329
He didn't see nothing.
