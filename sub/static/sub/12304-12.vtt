WEBVTT

00:33.060 --> 00:35.000
Go around!

00:38.900 --> 00:41.430
CSI Boa Vista,pull over.

00:41.500 --> 00:44.160
I repeat: pull over.

00:57.100 --> 00:58.860
Natalia Boa Vista.

00:58.930 --> 01:00.430
What's going on?

01:00.500 --> 01:03.330
You're under arrest for the murder of Nick Townsend.

01:06.360 --> 01:08.530
What?

01:12.760 --> 01:13.930
Where's Horatio?

01:14.000 --> 01:15.460
He's not going to let this happen.

01:15.530 --> 01:17.600
He's the one who called me.

01:23.930 --> 01:27.230
<i>WOMAN 253 Adam request an assist in Golden Beach,</i>

01:27.300 --> 01:31.660
1829 Dawson Drive, possible murder victim.

01:31.730 --> 01:33.760
My lucky day.

01:33.830 --> 01:35.960
I cannot believe you got here before me.

01:36.030 --> 01:37.500
Jump the gun much?

01:37.560 --> 01:39.330
How long is it going to take to process

01:39.400 --> 01:40.960
before I can get in to clean up?

01:41.030 --> 01:43.160
I don't know. I have no idea.

01:43.230 --> 01:44.230
Why,what's the big hurry?

01:44.300 --> 01:45.360
The blood's not going anywhere.

01:45.430 --> 01:48.000
Got a little lunch date.

01:48.060 --> 01:49.260
Lunch date?

01:49.330 --> 01:50.930
Really?

01:51.000 --> 01:53.630
Well,then I think I might just take my sweet time.

01:57.030 --> 01:59.260
You look good in green.

02:10.830 --> 02:13.860
36-year-old man killed in his own home.

02:13.930 --> 02:16.160
Do we have a cause of death,Alexx?

02:16.230 --> 02:18.700
Not yet,Horatio.

02:18.760 --> 02:20.860
I tell you one thing, he didn't go quickly.

02:20.930 --> 02:22.030
Why do you say that?

02:22.100 --> 02:24.000
It couldn't have been the granite.

02:24.060 --> 02:25.860
Baby boy's got blood spatter on his lips...

02:25.930 --> 02:28.060
from expiration.

02:29.660 --> 02:31.730
So he drowned...

02:31.800 --> 02:33.600
in his own blood.

02:33.660 --> 02:36.060
But look at this.

02:36.130 --> 02:38.430
That's a gunshot wound.

02:38.500 --> 02:41.800
Maybe not. No powder burns.

02:41.860 --> 02:43.130
Could be a puncture wound.

02:43.200 --> 02:44.800
I'll know more when I get him on my table.

02:44.860 --> 02:48.600
Okay. I understand the blood pool and the spatter,

02:48.660 --> 02:49.800
but his pants-

02:49.860 --> 02:50.730
that's a swipe, isn't it?

02:50.800 --> 02:51.930
What about that?

02:53.860 --> 02:56.660
Possibly transfer from our killer.

02:56.730 --> 03:00.030
Probably somebody he knew.

03:00.100 --> 03:02.260
Yes,and soon so will we.

03:55.890 --> 03:57.320
Hey.

03:57.390 --> 03:59.190
So I've been searching this place up and down

03:59.250 --> 04:00.390
for a murder weapon,

04:00.450 --> 04:01.450
but,uh,haven't had any luck.

04:01.520 --> 04:02.450
How about you?

04:02.520 --> 04:03.850
Oh,yeah.

04:03.920 --> 04:05.850
We got a whole wealth of riches in here.

04:05.920 --> 04:07.420
You gotta love granite.

04:07.490 --> 04:09.020
It's a perfect surface for prints.

04:09.090 --> 04:11.290
Yeah. So,uh,Eric and Kelly are back in the lab.

04:11.350 --> 04:13.720
Do me a favor- scan these into the mobile unit

04:13.790 --> 04:14.790
and,uh,shoot 'em over.

04:14.850 --> 04:15.920
Yep. Thanks.

04:30.390 --> 04:31.320
Hey.

04:31.390 --> 04:32.490
Ryan called me.

04:32.550 --> 04:33.890
Have you got those prints

04:33.950 --> 04:35.250
from the crime scene?

04:35.320 --> 04:36.590
Yeah,Natalia sent them over.

04:36.650 --> 04:38.350
I'm running them through AFIS right now.

04:42.420 --> 04:44.420
"Jeff Murdock. "

04:44.490 --> 04:47.950
Volunteered his prints for some reason.

04:49.420 --> 04:51.050
He's got no record.

04:51.120 --> 04:52.550
Not yet.

04:53.590 --> 04:55.520
* *

05:14.590 --> 05:16.650
Jeff Murdock.

05:17.920 --> 05:18.950
Can I help you?

05:19.020 --> 05:21.190
Miami-Dade PD.

05:21.250 --> 05:24.350
You familiar with a man by the name of Benjamin Rhodes?

05:24.420 --> 05:27.950
Rhodes... He up by Golden Beach?

05:28.020 --> 05:30.350
He was. He's in the morgue now,Jeff.

05:30.420 --> 05:31.850
We found your fingerprints

05:31.920 --> 05:33.090
on a slab of granite that crushed him.

05:33.650 --> 05:34.920
Are you serious?

05:34.990 --> 05:36.050
As a triple bypass.

05:36.120 --> 05:37.750
Yeah,I went to his house.

05:37.820 --> 05:39.850
I install high-end audio-visual systems.

05:39.920 --> 05:41.120
I gave the guy a quote.

05:41.190 --> 05:42.420
When was that?

05:42.490 --> 05:43.690
A few days ago.

05:43.750 --> 05:45.150
Guy wanted to trick out his house:

05:45.220 --> 05:47.750
80-inch plasmas,surround sound, you name it.

05:47.820 --> 05:50.490
I can have you hooked up in three days

05:50.550 --> 05:51.590
including the plasmas.

05:51.650 --> 05:52.950
Let me think about it.

05:53.020 --> 05:55.650
Okay,just got to leave you my card.

05:55.720 --> 05:57.620
Let me know.

05:58.550 --> 06:00.590
Unfortunately,the only person

06:00.650 --> 06:02.550
that could corroborate that is no longer among the living.

06:02.620 --> 06:04.320
Well,look deeper.

06:04.390 --> 06:06.520
You'll find my prints in homes all over the county.

06:06.590 --> 06:09.050
That's why I volunteered them to the police

06:09.120 --> 06:10.250
to avoid situations like this.

06:10.320 --> 06:12.420
Or provide you with cover.

06:12.490 --> 06:15.820
Look,I'm just trying to make a living,man.

06:15.890 --> 06:18.550
So unless you guys got something else,

06:18.620 --> 06:20.320
I really got to get back to it.

06:20.390 --> 06:22.290
Thank you for your time.

06:30.420 --> 06:31.750
Hey,Maxine, did you get anything

06:31.820 --> 06:33.450
on the blood swipe on the vic's pants?

06:33.520 --> 06:35.450
You know,contrary to popular belief,

06:35.520 --> 06:37.190
breathing down one's neck does

06:37.250 --> 06:39.090
not improve productivity or make CODIS

06:39.150 --> 06:40.190
run any faster.

06:40.250 --> 06:41.390
Okay,I'm sorry.

06:41.450 --> 06:43.450
It's just,it must be going around today.

06:43.520 --> 06:45.920
Nick was jumping on me to process the crime scene

06:45.990 --> 06:47.420
quickly so that he could clean it

06:47.490 --> 06:49.190
and he could get to some lunch date.

06:52.290 --> 06:53.590
Uh...

06:55.850 --> 06:57.790
Pending DNA tests for other cases?

06:57.850 --> 07:00.650
Is this a "To do" list for me?

07:00.720 --> 07:02.650
I was going to ask you.

07:02.720 --> 07:03.720
You know,if you weren't

07:03.790 --> 07:07.190
too crazy with other stuff.

07:07.250 --> 07:09.120
'Cause you're Nick's lunch date?

07:09.190 --> 07:12.550
What is he doing?

07:12.620 --> 07:14.150
Why won't you listen to me?

07:14.220 --> 07:15.350
He is dangerous.

07:15.420 --> 07:17.190
I like dangerous.

07:17.250 --> 07:19.320
No,not this kind of dangerous.

07:19.390 --> 07:21.320
Woman to woman,

07:21.390 --> 07:25.190
I can't tell you what to do, but just be careful,okay?

07:27.250 --> 07:28.220
Oh,here we go.

07:28.290 --> 07:30.190
CODIS found a match.

07:30.250 --> 07:32.590
"Lauren Sloan. "

07:32.650 --> 07:35.850
Arrested over seven years ago for burglary.

07:39.620 --> 07:42.690
We found your blood on a murder victim-

07:42.750 --> 07:44.020
Benjamin Rhodes

07:44.090 --> 07:45.020
Benjamin's dead?

07:45.090 --> 07:47.450
How did you know him?

07:47.520 --> 07:49.020
I'm a therapist.

07:49.090 --> 07:50.990
He was one of my patients.

07:51.050 --> 07:53.390
Were you ever at his house?

07:53.450 --> 07:55.720
No,I don't do house calls.

07:55.790 --> 07:58.790
Then why did we find your blood on his pants?

07:58.850 --> 08:01.050
It must have happened this morning.

08:01.120 --> 08:02.690
He was my first appointment.

08:02.750 --> 08:03.790
I told him

08:03.850 --> 08:05.390
I had to drop him as a patient.

08:05.450 --> 08:06.920
I'm sorry,Benjamin. Great.

08:06.990 --> 08:08.220
Turn you back on me.

08:08.290 --> 08:09.790
Everyone else does! I'd be happy to...

08:09.850 --> 08:11.790
Forget it!

08:14.950 --> 08:17.090
This is exactly what I'm talking about.

08:17.150 --> 08:18.620
Wait,Dr. Sloane,I'm sorry.

08:18.690 --> 08:19.650
Get out!

08:20.790 --> 08:22.550
Get out.

08:24.950 --> 08:27.390
That was the last time I saw him.

08:27.450 --> 08:29.950
How'd you know it was my blood?

08:30.020 --> 08:32.690
Because you were arrested for robbery in 1999.

08:32.750 --> 08:34.020
Did you forget?

08:34.090 --> 08:37.150
I had a problem with shoplifting.

08:38.090 --> 08:39.720
It became compulsive.

08:39.789 --> 08:42.520
But getting help in the end inspired me to help others.

08:42.590 --> 08:43.990
Well,at least one of your patients

08:44.049 --> 08:45.990
would beg to differ

08:46.050 --> 08:48.220
because we checked Benjamin's phone records.

08:49.550 --> 08:51.820
Is there any reason that he made repeated calls

08:51.890 --> 08:54.320
to the State Board of Psychology?

08:54.390 --> 08:55.720
Sometimes my clients

08:55.790 --> 08:57.450
dot like to face who they really are

08:57.520 --> 09:00.590
and they need to assign blame.

09:06.190 --> 09:08.520
Hey,can I help you?

09:08.590 --> 09:10.950
No,I'm good. Hot outside.

09:11.020 --> 09:14.950
The A.C.,it's all nice,icy in here.

09:15.020 --> 09:16.550
Want to try and convince me you're not here

09:16.620 --> 09:17.950
to harass Natalia? No,I don't think so.

09:18.020 --> 09:19.450
It's none of your business,Eric.

09:19.520 --> 09:23.450
Hey,a civilian walks past that reception desk,

09:23.520 --> 09:24.850
this lab could lose its accreditation.

09:24.920 --> 09:26.590
That makes it my business.

09:26.650 --> 09:30.350
Okay,big man.

09:30.420 --> 09:32.020
As a matter of fact,Nick,

09:32.090 --> 09:34.420
crime scene at the Rhodes property was just released.

09:34.490 --> 09:36.990
Why don't you go over there and make yourself useful?

09:39.020 --> 09:40.350
You think you're better than me?

09:41.850 --> 09:43.990
Why,'cause I'm the mop-up guy?

09:44.050 --> 09:46.490
No,I don't care what you do.

09:46.550 --> 09:48.550
You're a lowlife.

09:49.990 --> 09:52.150
Who you kidding?

09:52.220 --> 09:54.720
You're just some sorry sap

09:54.790 --> 09:59.420
looking to get laid like the rest of us.

09:59.490 --> 10:01.020
You're pushing your luck,Nick.

10:01.090 --> 10:03.390
Oh! What's up,Eric?

10:03.450 --> 10:05.620
Test tube too small?

10:08.090 --> 10:09.890
Eric! Eric! Eric! Come on!

10:09.950 --> 10:10.890
Hey,hey,Eric! Come on.

10:10.950 --> 10:12.550
Back up. Back up.

10:12.620 --> 10:14.250
You listen to your buddyere.

10:14.320 --> 10:17.350
Inappropriate lab behavior.

10:17.420 --> 10:18.650
Let me tell you something.

10:18.720 --> 10:20.590
Outside these walls,big world.

10:20.650 --> 10:21.990
Real big. People die every day.

10:22.050 --> 10:23.550
You want to continue this conversation,

10:23.620 --> 10:24.850
you know where to find me.

10:24.920 --> 10:27.350
Eric... You get lost.

10:32.550 --> 10:33.790
Yeah.

10:35.390 --> 10:38.120
Alexx,Benjamin Rhodes?

10:38.190 --> 10:41.120
Yes. It definitely wasn't death by granite,Horatio.

10:41.190 --> 10:43.490
The vertebrae in his neck are intact.

10:43.550 --> 10:45.190
Which brings us back to his chest wound.

10:45.250 --> 10:47.190
Most definitely.

10:47.250 --> 10:48.920
His sternum is fractured,

10:48.990 --> 10:50.390
esophagus pierced.

10:50.450 --> 10:52.290
Pierced by what?

10:52.350 --> 10:55.450
You're not going to believe this,but I don't know.

10:55.520 --> 10:57.850
Stippling around the wound says he was shot,

10:57.920 --> 10:59.720
but there was no projectile in his chest cavity.

10:59.790 --> 11:01.590
Was there an exit wound?

11:01.650 --> 11:03.250
Only an entrance.

11:03.320 --> 11:04.420
My only explanation

11:04.490 --> 11:07.390
is that the projectile, whatever it was,

11:07.450 --> 11:10.420
was lodged in his esophagus, and he coughed it up.

11:10.490 --> 11:13.050
Alexx,there was blood all over the floor.

11:13.120 --> 11:15.290
I'd get your guys to wade through it,Horatio.

11:16.750 --> 11:18.050
The answer's there.

11:19.190 --> 11:20.450
Mr. Wolfe...

11:20.520 --> 11:22.120
Mr. Wolfe,go back to the Rhodes' house

11:22.190 --> 11:27.890
w|?

11:35.070 --> 11:37.000
Hey,Nick...

11:37.070 --> 11:38.870
hold up.

11:40.940 --> 11:44.470
Oh,you're not Nick. You're a sharp one.

11:44.540 --> 11:46.940
Yeah,well,you still need to stop. Where's Nick? You just missed him.

11:47.000 --> 11:49.270
He came by, then he took off somewhere.

11:49.340 --> 11:50.800
Whatever. Blood's blood.

11:50.870 --> 11:51.970
What do you want?

11:52.040 --> 11:53.500
I want you to,uh,

11:53.570 --> 11:55.040
stop compromising the evidence for one.

11:55.100 --> 11:56.100
You guys had your run of the place.

11:56.170 --> 11:57.940
I was given the go-ahead.

11:58.000 --> 11:59.970
Okay,well,now you're getting the go-away.

12:01.640 --> 12:03.670
Missed something,huh?

12:03.740 --> 12:06.440
This is a murder investigation.

12:06.500 --> 12:08.600
Don't you think you guys ought to be a little more thorough?

12:08.670 --> 12:11.870
Take a walk. Go ahead.

12:11.940 --> 12:13.170
Fine.

12:13.240 --> 12:16.270
But if my supe chews me out,

12:16.790 --> 12:18.850
I'll give him your digits.

13:03.650 --> 13:05.690
What are you?

13:16.250 --> 13:17.690
Oh,hey.

13:17.750 --> 13:19.290
You're in a hurry.

13:19.350 --> 13:20.690
What's up?

13:20.750 --> 13:23.920
I just got a call-out.

13:23.990 --> 13:25.520
Oh,I'll get my kit, I'll go with you.

13:25.590 --> 13:27.790
You can't.

13:29.020 --> 13:33.020
The address is 378 Coral Drive in Aventura.

13:33.090 --> 13:36.320
Coral Drive... that's where Nick lives.

13:36.390 --> 13:38.720
Yeah.

13:38.790 --> 13:41.420
Look,it's a homicide.

13:43.050 --> 13:46.520
Look,I'll call you as soon as I know something,all right?

13:46.590 --> 13:48.020
Okay.

14:10.090 --> 14:11.550
Alexx is on her way.

14:11.620 --> 14:15.120
So this is,uh, Natalia's ex,huh?

14:15.190 --> 14:16.490
Yeah,it is.

14:16.550 --> 14:17.950
Who called it in?

14:18.020 --> 14:20.790
Mailman. Front door was wide open.

14:20.850 --> 14:23.350
Nice digs for a guy that just got out of jail,

14:23.420 --> 14:25.550
working entrail duty.

14:25.620 --> 14:27.520
Gentlemen.

14:27.590 --> 14:28.750
H,I'm all over this.

14:28.820 --> 14:30.790
Eric,I'm going to stop you

14:30.850 --> 14:32.350
and put somebody else on this.

14:32.420 --> 14:34.020
What do you mean?

14:34.090 --> 14:36.120
Natalia has a personal connection to the victim

14:36.190 --> 14:38.390
and that makes this a conflict of interest for us.

14:39.820 --> 14:41.750
Who's going to work the case?

14:41.820 --> 14:44.290
Jake Berkeley-

14:44.350 --> 14:46.490
with the night shift CSI's.

14:46.550 --> 14:48.620
What,he's a CSI now?

14:48.690 --> 14:50.250
Homicide detective.

14:52.450 --> 14:55.250
Eric,this whole thing has to be aboveboard

14:55.320 --> 14:57.050
and handled correctly.

14:57.120 --> 14:58.820
You understand?

14:58.890 --> 15:00.450
I do.

15:00.520 --> 15:02.490
Thank you.

15:05.590 --> 15:07.450
Did you get anything on the doorknob?

15:07.520 --> 15:09.550
Just smudges,no ridge detail.

15:09.620 --> 15:11.890
You've been at it for ten minutes.

15:13.650 --> 15:16.250
I'm thorough.

15:16.320 --> 15:17.720
You're graveyard shift.

15:17.790 --> 15:19.490
Just used to groping around in the dark.

15:19.550 --> 15:21.950
Delko,you heard your boss.

15:22.020 --> 15:24.020
You got your marching orders to step off.

15:24.090 --> 15:25.690
We need to focus.

15:25.750 --> 15:27.390
Well,maybe you need to shift your focus

15:27.450 --> 15:30.120
from the doorknob to that window there.

15:30.190 --> 15:32.320
There's a disturbance in the bamboo.

15:37.320 --> 15:38.550
Courtney,could you

15:38.620 --> 15:40.350
check out this area,please?

15:46.690 --> 15:49.020
Got partial palm prints here.

15:49.090 --> 15:50.090
Possible fingerprints.

15:53.390 --> 15:54.950
Seems like our killer may have been

15:55.020 --> 15:56.890
casing the place.

15:56.950 --> 15:58.590
I'll get these prints to the lab.

16:12.390 --> 16:13.750
What do we got?

16:13.820 --> 16:15.590
Any evidence Nick Townsend had a visitor?

16:15.650 --> 16:16.950
I'd say.

16:17.020 --> 16:18.490
Of the female variety.

16:20.390 --> 16:23.050
Bed's unmade. Sheets smell of perfume.

16:23.120 --> 16:25.520
They're a literal DNA parade.

16:25.590 --> 16:27.490
What do we know about this woman?

16:27.550 --> 16:28.550
Well,she may keep

16:28.620 --> 16:29.550
some stuff here-

16:29.620 --> 16:31.520
check out the open drawer.

16:34.590 --> 16:36.890
See if you can trace any of the items.

16:36.950 --> 16:39.590
I want to meet our lucky lady.

16:39.650 --> 16:41.690
You can meet a part of her right now.

16:43.050 --> 16:45.020
Hair.

16:45.090 --> 16:47.220
Possible root still attached.

16:47.290 --> 16:48.550
Run it through DNA.

16:49.450 --> 16:51.690
And do it yourself.

16:56.420 --> 16:57.450
Hi.

16:57.520 --> 17:01.090
What is it with you day shifts?

17:01.150 --> 17:02.620
You're not supposed to be working this case.

17:02.690 --> 17:05.220
It just so happens that I have numerous other cases

17:05.290 --> 17:07.690
involving fingerprints.

17:07.750 --> 17:09.890
So,have you got any suspects?

17:09.950 --> 17:12.050
Hmm,subtle.

17:12.119 --> 17:14.089
Just making a little conversation.

17:14.150 --> 17:16.319
Normally,I'm sleeping right now.

17:21.349 --> 17:22.950
Natalia.

17:24.349 --> 17:26.920
That's why you're not on this case.

17:35.190 --> 17:37.620
I did not kill my ex-husband,

17:37.690 --> 17:40.250
and you can't just arrest me like this.

17:40.320 --> 17:41.850
I'm afraid I can.

17:48.620 --> 17:50.350
Will you say something,please?

17:54.120 --> 17:56.420
You're kidding me. Say something,please.

18:10.190 --> 18:13.250
So,Natalia...

18:13.320 --> 18:16.290
where were you headed when I picked you up?

18:16.350 --> 18:18.220
Out of town?

18:18.290 --> 18:21.990
No,I had just found out that Nick was dead,

18:22.050 --> 18:23.550
and I...

18:24.650 --> 18:26.250
...wanted to get some air.

18:26.320 --> 18:28.720
Mm-hmm.

18:28.790 --> 18:30.090
You guys have quite the history.

18:30.150 --> 18:32.650
Says here that he went to jail for breaking your arm,

18:32.720 --> 18:35.350
and then filed a T.R.O. against you.

18:35.420 --> 18:37.150
Because he was trying to get back at me,yeah.

18:37.220 --> 18:38.350
But you did get violent with him

18:38.420 --> 18:40.990
on the job at a crime scene

18:41.050 --> 18:42.350
in front of Eric Delko

18:42.420 --> 18:44.020
whom you briefly dated, is that correct?

18:44.090 --> 18:45.490
Did Eric actually tell you that?

18:45.550 --> 18:46.950
You also made some volatile statements.

18:47.020 --> 18:48.320
You're quoted as saying,

18:48.390 --> 18:50.120
"I think that I want to kill him. "

18:50.190 --> 18:51.690
to Calleigh Duquesne.

18:51.750 --> 18:54.150
No,no,no,no,that was...

18:54.220 --> 18:56.050
I mean...

18:56.120 --> 18:57.250
it was girl talk.

18:57.320 --> 18:58.690
I was joking.

18:58.750 --> 19:00.620
This is no joke.

19:00.690 --> 19:02.120
I have evidence that you were stalking him.

19:02.190 --> 19:04.020
That I was stalking him? Why would I do that?

19:04.090 --> 19:07.220
Just so that I'm clear-

19:07.290 --> 19:10.420
were you or were you not outside his window?

19:10.490 --> 19:12.020
Yes,I was,

19:12.090 --> 19:14.490
but I was never inside.

19:14.550 --> 19:15.850
Really?

19:15.920 --> 19:18.020
Never?

19:18.090 --> 19:20.020
You're familiar with DNA?

19:20.090 --> 19:21.850
Because we found

19:21.920 --> 19:23.850
your hair in his bed.

19:23.920 --> 19:25.920
Now,that's strange,

19:25.990 --> 19:27.550
since you've never been inside. No,no,no,that's not what I...

19:27.620 --> 19:29.250
That's not what I said.

19:29.320 --> 19:30.750
Okay,you're twisting my words now,

19:30.820 --> 19:32.990
because I didn't say never. I meant never today.

19:33.050 --> 19:34.990
When the shoe's on the other foot,

19:35.050 --> 19:36.620
it's a tight fit,isn't it?

19:38.250 --> 19:40.750
Nick and I have a very complicated relationship.

19:40.820 --> 19:43.390
I was there last night.

19:43.450 --> 19:47.450
There were some text messages on Nick's phone

19:47.520 --> 19:48.920
about a lunch date today.

19:50.520 --> 19:53.450
Now,we're checking your phone records.

19:55.890 --> 19:56.950
Okay.

19:57.020 --> 19:58.250
No,no,don't say anything.

19:58.320 --> 19:59.350
Don't say something

19:59.420 --> 20:01.150
that you're going to regret,just...

20:01.220 --> 20:02.290
We'll give you some time

20:02.350 --> 20:04.450
to really consider your answer.

20:04.520 --> 20:06.290
Or to get a good lawyer.

20:14.820 --> 20:16.050
Lieutenant.

20:16.120 --> 20:18.390
Ms. Valera. What's wrong?

20:18.450 --> 20:19.720
I just heard what happened.

20:19.790 --> 20:21.320
The Nick Townsend case.

20:21.390 --> 20:23.790
I found you so I could tell you in person.

20:23.850 --> 20:26.520
Natalia didn't kill her ex-husband.

20:57.300 --> 20:58.600
What's going on, Lieutenant?

20:58.670 --> 21:00.900
Jake,this is Maxine Valera.

21:00.970 --> 21:02.940
Yeah. I know who she is. She's come to me

21:03.000 --> 21:05.570
with information that I think you should hear.

21:05.640 --> 21:06.640
Well,I'm all ears.

21:06.700 --> 21:07.640
No interrogation tactics.

21:07.700 --> 21:09.570
I just want you to listen.

21:09.640 --> 21:10.970
You understand?

21:11.040 --> 21:12.800
Yes,sir.

21:12.870 --> 21:14.240
Go ahead,ma'am.

21:19.370 --> 21:21.040
Just have a seat.

21:26.370 --> 21:28.770
Today,

21:28.840 --> 21:30.900
I met Nick at his condo.

21:30.970 --> 21:32.240
For lunch.

21:32.300 --> 21:33.970
You text-messaged him.

21:34.040 --> 21:36.440
Yes.

21:36.500 --> 21:37.970
Natalia warned me.

21:38.040 --> 21:40.240
Said he was dangerous.

21:40.300 --> 21:42.740
And she was right.

21:42.800 --> 21:44.900
What did he do?

21:44.970 --> 21:47.500
I was just giving him a kiss good-bye.

21:47.570 --> 21:50.970
Then he got scary.

21:51.040 --> 21:54.000
What do you say we take this into the other room?

21:54.070 --> 21:56.470
I should really get going.

21:56.540 --> 21:58.800
Need a little music?

21:58.870 --> 22:00.840
Huh? That it?

22:00.900 --> 22:02.770
Nick,what are you doing?

22:02.840 --> 22:05.440
I'm going to loosen you up one way or another.

22:05.500 --> 22:07.100
Come on.

22:07.170 --> 22:08.770
Hey! You come with me.

22:10.040 --> 22:12.700
Nick?

22:17.240 --> 22:18.900
It was me.

22:18.970 --> 22:21.500
I'm the one responsible.

22:25.240 --> 22:26.740
Well,that's sweet.

22:28.040 --> 22:29.700
You're covering for your friend.

22:29.770 --> 22:31.200
But I'm sorry.

22:31.270 --> 22:33.470
That's not going to get Natalia out of holding.

22:33.540 --> 22:35.900
Why not? I just told you I did it.

22:35.970 --> 22:37.540
Because the evidence trumps your confession.

22:37.600 --> 22:38.970
Natalia has history,motive,

22:39.040 --> 22:41.070
and I can place her inside and outside his house.

22:41.140 --> 22:45.000
Well,even if she was there doesn't make her a killer.

22:46.700 --> 22:49.340
Would you change your mind if I told you

22:49.400 --> 22:51.900
we found her DNA in his bed?

22:53.570 --> 22:55.740
She was sleeping with him?

22:55.800 --> 22:58.940
She neglected to tell you that.

22:59.000 --> 23:01.070
She slept with him.

23:01.140 --> 23:02.370
She got angry.

23:02.440 --> 23:04.200
She killed him.

23:06.440 --> 23:08.700
Hey,Ryan. You seen Detective Berkeley?

23:08.770 --> 23:11.070
He doesn't figure on answering my pages.

23:11.140 --> 23:12.940
Everyone's a little bit scattered right now.

23:13.000 --> 23:14.540
What's going on?

23:14.600 --> 23:17.900
Well,I was about to cut open Nick Townsend,to determine COD,

23:17.970 --> 23:19.670
but I thought this was more pressing.

23:19.740 --> 23:22.000
I swabbed a wound on his knuckles,

23:22.070 --> 23:23.970
and it appears to be a fight bite.

23:30.100 --> 23:31.770
What's wrong,baby?

23:31.840 --> 23:34.870
Eric and Nick got in a fight this morning.

23:34.940 --> 23:36.600
The said that they were going

23:36.670 --> 23:38.870
to take it outside for part two.

23:38.940 --> 23:40.040
You don't think...

23:40.100 --> 23:41.640
You know what? Um...

23:41.700 --> 23:42.970
I can't have anything to do

23:43.040 --> 23:44.700
with that DNA sample, but will you take it

23:44.770 --> 23:46.100
to Leo Donwell? Of course I will.

23:46.170 --> 23:48.670
I'll... I'll go call Horatio.

23:50.800 --> 23:52.170
Sir,I entered the sample

23:52.240 --> 23:53.800
that Dr. Woods obtained from the victim's hand.

23:53.870 --> 23:57.270
Check it against my criminalists.

23:57.340 --> 23:58.500
But... Right.

23:58.570 --> 23:59.970
Everyone who works a scene

24:00.040 --> 24:01.500
is automatically put into the system

24:01.570 --> 24:02.670
for elimination purposes.

24:02.740 --> 24:04.570
<i>I want to eliminate them.</i>

24:15.070 --> 24:16.670
No match.

24:16.740 --> 24:17.740
Widen it.

24:17.800 --> 24:19.740
CODIS? Okay.

24:19.800 --> 24:22.170
Here goes.

24:25.140 --> 24:27.440
Philip Craven. Wait a minute.

24:27.500 --> 24:29.000
That's that crime scene cleanup guy.

24:32.040 --> 24:33.570
Should I call Detective Berkeley?

24:33.640 --> 24:34.870
Don't bother.

24:34.940 --> 24:36.440
The pleasure will be mine.

24:38.500 --> 24:40.840
So I got cut. What about it?

24:40.900 --> 24:42.370
You fought with Nick.

24:42.440 --> 24:43.900
I want to know why.

24:43.970 --> 24:45.440
No way.

24:45.500 --> 24:47.940
Guy's dead,and you're going to try to pin this on me?

24:48.000 --> 24:48.970
Convince me otherwise.

24:49.040 --> 24:51.040
Not only did he flake

24:51.100 --> 24:52.500
on cleaning that crime scene earlier,

24:52.570 --> 24:53.600
but the guy's been stealing.

24:53.670 --> 24:54.840
How do you know that?

24:54.900 --> 24:57.070
I been keeping my eyes open a while.

24:57.140 --> 24:58.640
This time,I was sure.

25:06.770 --> 25:08.300
Yo,Nick. You can't just leave,man.

25:08.370 --> 25:10.270
Cover for me. I got a woman to meet.

25:10.340 --> 25:11.970
Do the same for you.

25:12.040 --> 25:13.470
Oh,yeah? You going to give her the jewelry

25:13.540 --> 25:14.700
I just saw you steal from the scene?

25:14.770 --> 25:16.800
Don't push me.

25:16.870 --> 25:18.100
And you're high.

25:18.170 --> 25:21.240
Yeah? And you're going back to prison if I talk.

25:29.440 --> 25:32.340
Look,I didn't kill the guy,all right?

25:32.400 --> 25:34.540
I just tried to set him straight.

25:34.600 --> 25:36.340
Forgive me if I don't believe you.

25:41.370 --> 25:43.040
I want a lawyer.

25:43.100 --> 25:45.500
Spoken like the last request

25:45.570 --> 25:47.200
of a guilty man.

25:54.440 --> 25:57.200
Natalia. Horatio.

25:57.270 --> 26:00.000
God. You're hearing a lot of things about me right now.

26:00.070 --> 26:02.170
Well,put your mind at ease. I don't listen

26:02.240 --> 26:04.600
to them unless they come from you.

26:04.670 --> 26:08.440
A lot of stuff has happened between me and Nick.

26:08.500 --> 26:10.240
Things that

26:10.300 --> 26:12.740
I am not exactly proud of.

26:12.800 --> 26:15.970
You were at Nick's place today.

26:16.040 --> 26:18.100
Did you see Philip Craven there?

26:18.170 --> 26:21.600
The cleanup guy? No. I didn't see him.

26:23.040 --> 26:27.100
But I... I did see someone else.

26:27.170 --> 26:29.100
You saw Valera there.

26:29.170 --> 26:32.400
I knew that she was going on a date with Nick,

26:32.470 --> 26:34.000
and I was really worried about her.

26:34.070 --> 26:36.540
Did you share this with Jake Berkeley?

26:36.600 --> 26:39.170
No. Because I didn't want to go down that road again

26:39.240 --> 26:39.665
with the whole mole business.

26:39.700 --> 26:42.470
I really just wanted to protect her.

26:42.540 --> 26:44.900
What exactly did you see?

26:49.370 --> 26:50.900
Enough.

26:50.970 --> 26:55.200
Then,Ms. Boa Vista, you know what you need to do.

27:07.300 --> 27:09.540
Horatio said the three of us should talk.

27:11.000 --> 27:13.100
And I agree with him.

27:13.170 --> 27:14.670
You got something you want

27:14.740 --> 27:16.070
to tell me, Natalia?

27:16.140 --> 27:17.540
Yeah,I do.

27:18.870 --> 27:22.500
I'm really sorry,Maxine.

27:22.570 --> 27:23.840
What is it?

27:23.900 --> 27:25.740
I went over to Nick's because

27:25.800 --> 27:27.340
I was really scared for you,

27:27.400 --> 27:29.370
and I just wanted to make sure that nothing happened,

27:29.440 --> 27:30.900
and I saw you both through the window.

27:36.870 --> 27:38.000
You were there?

27:38.070 --> 27:39.870
I was,and I...

27:39.940 --> 27:42.140
I saw you trying to fight him off.

27:42.200 --> 27:43.540
And then you pushed him

27:43.600 --> 27:46.200
and he fell,and... and you ran.

27:46.270 --> 27:46.700
I'm going to loosen you up.

27:47.770 --> 27:48.700
Nick,what are you doing?

27:49.770 --> 27:50.640
Come on.

27:51.570 --> 27:55.540
Hey! You come with me.

28:02.570 --> 28:04.500
And then you didn't

28:04.570 --> 28:06.540
say anything because...

28:06.600 --> 28:08.940
you were relieved that he was finally out of your life.

28:09.000 --> 28:10.670
No. That wasn't it.

28:10.740 --> 28:13.040
Phone records confirm that you text-messaged Nick,

28:13.100 --> 28:14.400
luring him there.

28:14.470 --> 28:16.500
We had a date.

28:16.570 --> 28:17.870
And you admit to fighting with him,

28:17.940 --> 28:18.870
knocking him down.

28:18.940 --> 28:20.200
All the while,you're outside,

28:20.270 --> 28:22.400
watching,waiting,hoping.

28:22.470 --> 28:24.000
Everything hits the fan.

28:24.070 --> 28:26.400
Then you cover for each other.

28:26.470 --> 28:26.700
Sounds to me like murder.

28:27.770 --> 28:29.900
And conspiracy to murder.

28:29.970 --> 28:30.700
You don't actually believe that,do you?

28:31.770 --> 28:33.870
Well,maybe I do,maybe I don't.

28:33.940 --> 28:36.440
But what I do know is what it looks like.

28:36.500 --> 28:38.340
And it looks bad.

28:38.400 --> 28:40.200
Then where does that leave us?

28:41.600 --> 28:44.370
Unless one of you comes clean,then...

28:44.440 --> 28:46.900
I can't help either of you.

28:46.970 --> 28:48.540
Nobody can.

28:56.200 --> 28:57.840
<i>Mystery projectile</i>

28:57.900 --> 28:59.740
recovered in the blood pool at Benjamin Rhodes's house.

28:59.800 --> 29:01.900
It turns out it's paper wadding.

29:01.970 --> 29:03.440
He wasn't shot with a bullet?

29:03.500 --> 29:05.270
No. He was shot with a blank.

29:05.340 --> 29:06.900
Like they use in movies.

29:06.970 --> 29:09.600
Exactly. A blank is really just a cartridge

29:09.670 --> 29:11.600
filled with gunpowder and a wad of paper

29:11.670 --> 29:13.340
that contains the explosive pressure.

29:17.500 --> 29:19.700
So the shooter had to be at very close range.

29:19.770 --> 29:22.000
Well,technically,anything at that speed could kill you.

29:25.700 --> 29:26.940
But there was no gun at the scene,

29:27.000 --> 29:28.070
so how we going to track the shooter?

29:28.140 --> 29:30.000
Here's how. Take a look.

29:33.470 --> 29:35.240
Looks like white acrylic paint.

29:35.300 --> 29:38.170
Blank casings are usually rolled or scalloped.

29:38.240 --> 29:39.670
It's in a sealant.

29:39.740 --> 29:41.270
Then that should make it easy

29:41.340 --> 29:43.770
to find the gun shop that sold the blanks.

29:43.840 --> 29:46.400
Wadding is.357 inches.

29:46.470 --> 29:47.970
Circumference says it's from a.38.

29:49.970 --> 29:51.470
I'll make some calls.

29:56.370 --> 29:59.100
H,ATF hooked me up with a gun shop

29:59.170 --> 30:00.400
in Hallandale Beach.

30:00.470 --> 30:01.870
The blanks they sell use the same wadding

30:01.940 --> 30:03.500
as what were found at the crime scene.

30:03.570 --> 30:05.070
Did you find out who purchased them?

30:05.140 --> 30:06.770
The name on the credit card receipt

30:06.840 --> 30:09.240
was Jeff Murdock. Does that ring a bell?

30:09.300 --> 30:11.940
The audiovisual installer.

30:12.000 --> 30:13.600
Should I send someone to go pick him up?

30:13.670 --> 30:15.240
No. Let's get a warrant for the house,

30:15.300 --> 30:16.870
and don't go back

30:16.940 --> 30:18.540
until we can place that smoking gun in his hand.

30:18.600 --> 30:20.040
Got it.

30:32.340 --> 30:34.000
Don't know why you want me

30:34.070 --> 30:35.870
to look at all this stuff from Nick's place again.

30:35.940 --> 30:37.140
Because it's evidence,Jake.

30:37.200 --> 30:38.600
Evidence that led us to suspects.

30:38.670 --> 30:41.100
Evidence that led you to my people.

30:41.170 --> 30:43.040
You think my scope was too narrow?

30:43.100 --> 30:45.700
Prosecuting a crime, it's more than the evidence.

30:45.770 --> 30:47.270
It's context.

30:47.340 --> 30:49.900
In order to create the context, you have to do research

30:49.970 --> 30:52.170
on your victim.

30:52.240 --> 30:54.200
What are these?

30:54.270 --> 30:55.570
These are from crime scenes.

30:55.640 --> 30:57.340
They list items that were missing

30:57.400 --> 30:58.540
after the cleanup.

30:58.600 --> 31:00.240
What is the common denominator?

31:06.240 --> 31:09.500
Let me guess- Nick Townsend worked them all.

31:09.570 --> 31:12.540
What's your next move?

31:31.910 --> 31:33.350
I looked over all the stolen merchandise

31:33.410 --> 31:35.010
we found at Nick's place, like you asked.

31:35.080 --> 31:36.280
Anything jump out at you?

31:36.350 --> 31:37.910
The guy cleaned up for a living.

31:37.980 --> 31:39.550
In a lot of ways- everything's spotless.

31:39.610 --> 31:41.180
Except... for this.

31:44.450 --> 31:45.880
A woman's pierced earring.

31:45.950 --> 31:48.210
With blood on it- where was that discovered?

31:48.280 --> 31:51.110
Nick's living room. Same place

31:51.180 --> 31:53.480
Nick's body was found. Uh-huh.

31:53.550 --> 31:55.580
So the earring belongs to the killer.

31:55.650 --> 31:57.810
It may,but not Nick's.

31:57.880 --> 32:00.410
What do you mean? Well,the blood on it isn't a match to him.

32:00.480 --> 32:02.410
It's a match to Benjamin Rhodes.

32:02.480 --> 32:05.280
The guy shot with a blank.

32:05.350 --> 32:07.250
The victim in Calleigh's case. Nick stole that earring

32:07.310 --> 32:08.810
from the scene,

32:08.880 --> 32:10.650
and may have just broken her case wide open.

32:10.710 --> 32:12.350
So who does the earring belong to?

32:12.410 --> 32:15.810
Well,I ran the epithelials on the earring post,and...

32:18.980 --> 32:22.050
Lauren Sloan.

32:24.810 --> 32:27.680
We executed a search warrant on Jeff Murdock's house

32:27.750 --> 32:30.650
based on the blanks he bought.

32:30.710 --> 32:32.810
Guess who else lives there.

32:32.880 --> 32:34.810
Lauren Sloan?

32:34.880 --> 32:36.810
Yep.

32:38.080 --> 32:39.580
Turns out they're married,

32:39.650 --> 32:41.150
and that's her,uh,

32:41.210 --> 32:43.610
maiden name. Did you find a gun at the house?

32:43.680 --> 32:45.180
Yeah. Her husband's gun.

32:45.250 --> 32:46.710
It was loaded with blanks.

32:46.780 --> 32:48.210
Also,uh,

32:48.280 --> 32:50.380
check this out.

32:56.910 --> 32:59.650
You haven't been very forthcoming with us,Ms. Sloan.

32:59.710 --> 33:01.980
Or should I say, Mrs. Murdock.

33:02.810 --> 33:04.810
Yes,I have a husband.

33:04.880 --> 33:06.710
You never asked. So?

33:06.780 --> 33:09.880
This was the,uh,gun used to kill Benjamin Rhodes.

33:09.950 --> 33:12.910
We found it at your house.

33:12.980 --> 33:14.280
Wait a minute.

33:14.350 --> 33:16.580
You'|| not saying my husband killed him.

33:16.650 --> 33:17.980
Not at all.

33:18.050 --> 33:19.410
Actually,we found a powdery substance

33:19.480 --> 33:21.250
on the rubber grip of the gun.

33:21.310 --> 33:22.680
Trace says that

33:22.750 --> 33:25.980
it's a,uh... it's a mixture of mica,

33:26.050 --> 33:29.050
iron oxide and titanium dioxide.

33:29.110 --> 33:30.680
What's that?

33:30.750 --> 33:33.680
May I see your purse?

33:33.750 --> 33:35.680
It's makeup.

33:37.580 --> 33:39.050
Blush powder,actually,

33:39.110 --> 33:41.110
spilled in your purse.

33:42.310 --> 33:44.050
If you're implying

33:44.110 --> 33:45.780
that makes me a murderer...

33:45.850 --> 33:47.210
I'm not implying.

33:47.280 --> 33:49.050
Actually,a pair of your earrings

33:49.110 --> 33:51.110
made it into Benjamin Rhodes's house.

33:51.180 --> 33:55.250
So,it looks like you make house calls after all,huh?

33:57.850 --> 33:59.580
Earrings tie you to the scene.

33:59.650 --> 34:01.510
Trace puts the gun in your hand.

34:06.480 --> 34:09.179
I was having an affair with Benjamin.

34:09.250 --> 34:11.580
It was a mistake.

34:11.650 --> 34:14.909
I just wanted to go back to my husband,

34:14.980 --> 34:16.780
but Benjamin wouldn't hear of it.

34:16.850 --> 34:21.110
So I grabbed Jeff's gun

34:21.179 --> 34:22.580
<i>and went over to Benjamin's.</i>

34:22.650 --> 34:24.179
Put the gun away,Lauren.

34:24.250 --> 34:25.409
You've been calling the State Board?

34:25.480 --> 34:26.909
I could lose my license.

34:26.980 --> 34:28.449
But they should know what kind of woman you are.

34:28.510 --> 34:30.350
And so should your husband!

34:50.350 --> 34:53.380
But it was just a blank.

34:53.449 --> 34:55.380
I only wanted to scare him.

34:55.449 --> 34:59.180
I... Not kill him.

34:59.250 --> 35:03.710
Well,you know what they say about the best laid plans.

35:13.480 --> 35:14.910
Alexx.

35:14.980 --> 35:16.980
Do we have a cause of death?

35:17.050 --> 35:18.480
Yes,we have.

35:18.550 --> 35:20.580
Nick had a depressed skull fracture,Horatio.

35:20.650 --> 35:21.810
See this bone?

35:21.880 --> 35:24.150
It's displaced inward.

35:24.210 --> 35:26.550
And it's on the occipital bone.

35:26.610 --> 35:28.610
That makes it the back of the skull,

35:28.680 --> 35:32.480
and Natalia and Valera's stories don't line up.

35:34.050 --> 35:36.250
The blunt-force trauma caused a subdural hematoma.

35:36.310 --> 35:38.510
Blood collected between his dura and arachnoid,

35:38.580 --> 35:40.380
which caused the veins to tear.

35:40.450 --> 35:42.480
The intracranial pressure

35:42.550 --> 35:45.850
damaged delicate brain tissue, which was fatal.

35:45.910 --> 35:48.350
What about this tool mark?

35:48.410 --> 35:49.980
What could the weapon have been?

35:50.050 --> 35:51.650
Horatio,I've never seen a mark like this.

35:51.710 --> 35:53.010
It had to have been caused

35:53.080 --> 35:55.050
from some specialty tool.

35:55.110 --> 35:57.850
Now,I can try and cast it to narrow it down for you.

35:57.910 --> 36:00.180
Alexx,you just did.

36:36.950 --> 36:38.510
Why is he in here?

36:38.580 --> 36:41.380
We caught him with the weapon that killed Nick Townsend.

36:41.450 --> 36:42.710
How'd you find that?

36:42.780 --> 36:45.150
I followed the evidence,Jake.

36:45.210 --> 36:46.480
So did I.

36:46.550 --> 36:48.210
Yes,but in your case,

36:48.280 --> 36:50.310
you allowed the evidence to fit your theory,Jake,

36:50.380 --> 36:51.810
instead of the other way around.

36:51.880 --> 36:54.580
And by the way, the spotlight is off my lab now.

36:54.650 --> 36:56.680
So you're booting me off the case.

36:56.780 --> 36:57.980
In so many words.

37:04.110 --> 37:06.050
Nick Townsend's blood matches the weapon

37:06.110 --> 37:08.010
you used on him, Mr. Murdock.

37:09.350 --> 37:11.150
No use in lying now.

37:11.210 --> 37:13.050
You already arrested my wife.

37:14.410 --> 37:17.350
I only wanted to protect her.

37:17.410 --> 37:19.110
I was having an affair.

37:19.180 --> 37:21.650
What? Is it over?

37:23.750 --> 37:25.350
It is now.

37:25.410 --> 37:26.450
That's my gun.

37:26.510 --> 37:27.450
What did you do?

37:27.510 --> 37:29.410
I shot him!

37:29.480 --> 37:34.010
The bullets I bought,they were supposed to be blanks!

37:34.950 --> 37:36.450
Oh,God...

37:36.510 --> 37:39.980
Is there anything that can trace you back to that house?

37:40.050 --> 37:41.750
Oh,my God.

37:42.880 --> 37:44.780
I forgot a pair of my earrings.

37:45.850 --> 37:48.410
What are we gonna do?

37:49.780 --> 37:53.010
I went to the house to get them back,

37:53.080 --> 37:55.280
but the police were already there.

37:55.350 --> 37:56.710
So you waited.

37:56.780 --> 37:58.650
Couple of hours.

37:58.710 --> 38:01.250
Then some cleanup crew took over.

38:01.310 --> 38:03.150
I waited for them to leave.

38:03.210 --> 38:05.950
Then I heard them talking.

38:06.010 --> 38:10.010
Yo,Nick,you can't just leave,man.

38:10.080 --> 38:12.450
Come on,cover for me. I got a lady waiting.

38:12.510 --> 38:15.750
I'd do the same for you. Oh,yeah,you gonna give her the jewelry I just saw you

38:15.810 --> 38:17.350
steal from the scene?

38:28.710 --> 38:31.180
So,you followed him to his house.

38:31.250 --> 38:33.980
The place was like Grand Central Station.

38:34.050 --> 38:36.110
Women coming in and out.

38:36.180 --> 38:38.050
One of them left the door open.

38:38.110 --> 38:40.610
So you walked in and confronted Nick.

38:40.680 --> 38:42.550
He denied everything.

38:50.280 --> 38:54.710
Hey,man,what do you think, you can just walk in here?

38:54.780 --> 38:57.810
I know you took my wife's earrings at that house.

38:57.880 --> 39:00.180
I want them back.

39:00.250 --> 39:03.980
Why would some dead dude have your wife's earrings?

39:04.910 --> 39:07.050
Oh...

39:07.110 --> 39:08.780
I get it.

39:08.850 --> 39:11.250
That's pretty pathetic, if you ask me.

39:11.310 --> 39:12.510
Shut up.

39:12.580 --> 39:14.150
Get the hell out.

39:18.410 --> 39:21.410
I couldn't believe what I had done.

39:23.610 --> 39:26.450
Mr. Murdock, you can't protect someone

39:26.510 --> 39:28.380
by covering their crimes.

39:28.450 --> 39:31.280
You know the worst part?

39:31.350 --> 39:35.350
No matter what Lauren did...

39:35.410 --> 39:37.410
I still love her.

39:59.750 --> 40:01.910
Thought I'd...

40:01.980 --> 40:04.880
thought I'd see how you were doing.

40:08.110 --> 40:10.250
Nick's mom asked me to get

40:10.310 --> 40:13.510
all his personal effects together,and they're...

40:13.580 --> 40:14.950
That's it.

40:15.010 --> 40:17.410
The sum total of his life.

40:17.480 --> 40:19.480
Right there.

40:21.650 --> 40:25.610
I would really like to go through it,I just...

40:25.680 --> 40:28.250
...I can't.

40:57.510 --> 41:00.880
God,that guy made my life a living hell.

41:00.950 --> 41:02.750
Hell.

41:07.910 --> 41:12.710
Take a look at that,Natalia- some of it was good.

41:20.510 --> 41:23.380
Some of it was really incredible.

41:26.250 --> 41:28.610
So here's what we do.

41:28.680 --> 41:31.310
Let's hang on to that.

41:31.380 --> 41:32.780
Okay?

41:37.780 --> 41:39.180
Yeah.

41:41.210 --> 41:42.980
All right.
