<i>Previously on Heartland...</i>

00:01.384 --> 00:02.484
What are you working on?

00:02.518 --> 00:04.786
Nothing. No, it's nothing.

00:04.821 --> 00:05.921
You're writing a blog?

00:07.223 --> 00:09.024
- Are you all right?
- Ashley filed for divorce.

00:10.327 --> 00:11.893
<i>Damn.</i>

00:11.928 --> 00:13.929
Ah, there'll be other farms.

00:13.963 --> 00:15.296
Yeah, I guess.

00:20.803 --> 00:22.737
<i>- His name's Emir.</i>
<i>- This one's a handful.</i>

00:22.805 --> 00:25.607
<i>It's okay now.
Whoa! Whoa, boy!</i>

00:25.675 --> 00:28.710
<i>A prince, like actual
royalty, in Hudson?</i>

00:28.778 --> 00:30.544
I just wanted to
thank you for all you did.

00:30.579 --> 00:33.448
Oh! It's beautiful!
I can't accept that!

00:33.515 --> 00:34.882
Yes you can.

01:14.655 --> 01:16.023
Okay.

02:01.133 --> 02:03.669
Easy, easy, whoa! Easy.

02:04.604 --> 02:05.737
Easy!

02:09.542 --> 02:10.942
<i>Easy, boy!</i>

02:15.314 --> 02:16.414
Easy!

02:19.751 --> 02:21.152
Hey!

02:50.415 --> 02:52.316
Whoa.

02:52.350 --> 02:54.551
Ty, hey!

02:54.586 --> 02:56.853
Scott was right,
you should see Spartan!

02:56.887 --> 03:00.857
Yeah! It's like he wanted me to
see how well his leg has healed!

03:00.891 --> 03:04.160
What?! Are you serious?!

03:04.194 --> 03:05.862
Yeah, yeah, of course!
Come pick me up!

03:05.896 --> 03:08.698
Yeah, no, I'll be ready!
Okay, bye.

03:16.940 --> 03:19.708
No way! I don't believe it!

03:19.743 --> 03:20.909
<i>Something wrong?</i>

03:20.977 --> 03:22.411
Guess who I just
got an email from?

03:22.446 --> 03:24.013
Guess! No, you can't guess!

03:24.080 --> 03:25.814
I just got an email
from a publisher!

03:25.849 --> 03:28.551
Ladelle Press.

03:28.585 --> 03:30.386
My blog,
my "mom's the word" blog,

03:30.420 --> 03:32.888
they want to publish it
as a book!

03:32.956 --> 03:34.189
A book? Yes!

03:34.223 --> 03:35.423
That's great.

03:35.458 --> 03:36.759
Have you seen my boots?

03:36.826 --> 03:37.893
Under the bench.

03:37.927 --> 03:40.963
How do they turn
a bunch of your...

03:40.997 --> 03:43.899
Whatever it is you write
into a book?

03:43.967 --> 03:45.901
<i>See my gloves?</i>

03:45.969 --> 03:47.536
It's right here.

03:47.603 --> 03:49.737
<i>Hey, hey, hey, where-
where are you goin'?</i>

03:49.805 --> 03:51.039
To ride Phoenix.

03:51.073 --> 03:53.508
Do not, and I repeat,
do not go near the stream

03:53.576 --> 03:55.043
at the dude ranch! Why?

03:55.110 --> 03:57.646
Because the water is high
from all the mountain runoff.

03:57.713 --> 03:58.946
It's dangerous!

03:58.981 --> 04:01.949
Okay. You worry too much.

04:02.017 --> 04:04.285
Worry too much.

04:05.854 --> 04:08.222
That's great news, Lou.
Good for you.

04:10.693 --> 04:14.729
I am going to be
a published author.

04:19.735 --> 04:21.034
Deal must have
fallen through.

04:21.101 --> 04:22.303
I'm glad it did!

04:23.572 --> 04:28.576
But, Amy, realistically, can
we, uh, afford this place?

04:28.643 --> 04:30.977
Do we have to be realistic?

04:31.045 --> 04:32.045
What, you don't want to be?

04:32.080 --> 04:34.315
It's way more fun
being unrealistic!

04:34.382 --> 04:37.584
Can you imagine living here, Ty?
Our very own place?

04:39.020 --> 04:42.789
Well, I mean, we could always find
out what they're asking, right?

04:47.394 --> 04:49.029
Hey, Caleb!

04:49.063 --> 04:50.330
Hey there.

04:50.364 --> 04:53.633
So I watched a few
of your rodeo videos online.

04:53.667 --> 04:54.967
Well, that's time
you're not gettin' back.

04:55.035 --> 04:56.936
<i>no,
come on, it was, uh...</i>

04:56.970 --> 04:58.438
It was interesting.

04:58.472 --> 05:00.373
I mean I'm a total stranger
to that world,

05:00.407 --> 05:03.976
but I couldn't help
but be kind of in awe.

05:05.045 --> 05:06.379
Really?

05:06.413 --> 05:10.382
It was ridiculously
scary, but impressive...

05:10.416 --> 05:11.550
For a cowboy.

05:11.584 --> 05:12.952
Well, I will take that
as a compliment.

05:13.019 --> 05:16.655
Although I can't quite comprehend
why someone would deliberately

05:16.689 --> 05:19.024
try to kill or maim themselves.

05:19.059 --> 05:21.493
It's a profession,
and like any profession,

05:21.527 --> 05:23.528
especially
the financial business,

05:23.563 --> 05:26.265
the main part is
just to not get killed.

05:26.299 --> 05:27.799
Yeah, I guess you're right.

05:27.867 --> 05:29.901
<i>Hey there, cowboy!</i>

05:32.672 --> 05:34.105

06:29.961 --> 06:32.062
Okay, so what are you
doing here, ash?

06:32.130 --> 06:34.664
I just came to check up
on my mom's house.

06:34.699 --> 06:36.533
She's pretty much living
full time in Florida now

06:36.567 --> 06:40.804
and she's got a property
in Wellington and...

06:40.838 --> 06:42.004
Well, the truth is,

06:42.072 --> 06:45.107
I was looking for an excuse
to come back here.

06:45.142 --> 06:48.211
I miss everyone -
my friends, you.

06:50.680 --> 06:53.149
Well, it's been awhile.
What are you up to?

06:53.217 --> 06:55.318
Uh, just the usual.

06:56.286 --> 06:57.453
Oh, um...

06:57.520 --> 06:59.655
I started up a business,
rough stock,

06:59.723 --> 07:01.357
so that's been goin'
pretty well.

07:01.424 --> 07:02.624
Wow!

07:02.659 --> 07:05.861
Uh... What about you?
How are you doing?

07:05.928 --> 07:10.866
Well, I just graduated, and big news,
I got accepted into law school.

07:10.900 --> 07:11.933
Law school?

07:12.001 --> 07:13.168
Crazy, huh?

07:13.236 --> 07:15.437
Too bad you didn't have that
degree when we were still married.

07:15.472 --> 07:18.540
Coulda gotten divorced for free.

07:22.912 --> 07:28.350
Damn. I, uh... I got a thing I
gotta go to, so... Oh, uh, well...

07:28.417 --> 07:31.719
Maybe we can meet later...
If you want to?

07:31.787 --> 07:34.822
I can text you my number.
Call me?

07:35.858 --> 07:37.058
Maybe.

07:53.909 --> 07:56.343
Whoa! Easy, boy!

08:03.785 --> 08:05.585
Adrian, take charge!

08:12.493 --> 08:14.561
Easy, boy, easy!

08:15.730 --> 08:19.533
<i>You're giving
him mixed signals!</i>

08:20.501 --> 08:22.302
Hey!

08:22.336 --> 08:24.805
Here, let me ride him.

08:29.143 --> 08:31.311
It's all right, Zeus.

08:31.345 --> 08:33.246
You're fine.

08:33.280 --> 08:36.749
Settle. Concentrate.

08:39.753 --> 08:42.822
That's better. Good boy.

08:49.362 --> 08:50.329
That's what he does.

08:50.363 --> 08:53.365
So... You think
you can get the better of me,

08:53.399 --> 08:55.801
is that it?!

08:55.836 --> 08:57.603
We'll see about that.

08:57.637 --> 09:00.305
His breeder said he's a problem.

09:00.340 --> 09:04.909
I like a challenge, but if
you're not up for the job,

09:04.944 --> 09:08.013
I know somebody who might be.

09:21.494 --> 09:23.495
What's going on with him?

09:23.529 --> 09:24.629
Jack, he's limping.

09:24.663 --> 09:26.030
There's something wrong
with his leg.

09:32.004 --> 09:34.205
Okay, we crossed the stream.

09:34.239 --> 09:36.140
Even when I told you not to?

09:37.342 --> 09:39.010
Give me your foot.

09:39.044 --> 09:41.678
Well, it was really shallow
and it wasn't dangerous at all.

09:41.713 --> 09:43.114
Yeah?

09:48.487 --> 09:50.388
<i>Yeah, see? Stone bruise.</i>

09:50.422 --> 09:53.390
Probably stepped on a rock
on the stream bed.

09:53.424 --> 09:54.691
Is that bad?

09:54.759 --> 10:00.631
Well, it can be, yeah, real bad,
especially if it starts to abscess.

10:00.665 --> 10:04.001
What it's gonna take to get
you to do what you're told?

10:04.035 --> 10:07.703
- Come on.
- I'm sorry, Jack.

10:07.771 --> 10:10.473
I am just so blown
away that you like my blog.

10:10.508 --> 10:12.642
It's totally amazing!

10:12.709 --> 10:14.444
We're excited too!

10:14.512 --> 10:17.580
We think its prospects in the
marketplace are very promising.

10:17.614 --> 10:20.116
What was it that attracted
you to "mom's the word"

10:20.151 --> 10:21.217
in the first place?

10:21.252 --> 10:23.486
I mean, was it
how many hits I got?

10:23.554 --> 10:26.121
That it was very, you know,
well written?

10:27.591 --> 10:29.258
We were impressed with
the number of hits you get,

10:29.325 --> 10:32.361
and, you know, we're always
interested in real life stories,

10:32.429 --> 10:33.996
especially ones
related to family

10:34.064 --> 10:36.532
and all the joys and pitfalls
of making it work.

10:36.600 --> 10:37.900
Or not.

10:37.968 --> 10:39.869
Especially the "or not" part.

10:39.937 --> 10:43.105
My publisher firmly believes
that readers want to feel

10:43.139 --> 10:45.541
like they're looking through a
keyhole into someone's private life,

10:45.575 --> 10:49.978
complete with all the gory,
juicy, spicy details.

10:50.046 --> 10:51.547
Spicy, juicy details.

10:52.515 --> 10:54.916
That's what makes a best seller.

10:54.984 --> 10:56.017
Got it.

10:57.954 --> 10:59.487
Ashley? Here in town?

10:59.555 --> 11:01.522
Poor Caleb!

11:02.491 --> 11:04.826
Yeah, he'll be all right though.

11:04.894 --> 11:06.461
Jack, did Amy tell ya?

11:06.528 --> 11:08.429
That ranch you saw,
it's back on the market.

11:08.497 --> 11:09.731
Really? You don't say.

11:09.765 --> 11:11.299
A ranch? Why are
you looking at a ranch?

11:11.366 --> 11:12.601
So did you
call the agent yet?

11:12.635 --> 11:13.834
Yeah, we looked it up.

11:13.902 --> 11:14.969
What, are you serious?

11:15.003 --> 11:16.204
Come on, land's crazy expensive

11:16.238 --> 11:17.638
<i>and if it's got a house</i>
<i>and outbuildings,</i>

11:17.672 --> 11:18.806
<i>it's gonna be</i>
<i>right through the roof!</i>

11:18.840 --> 11:21.642
Yeah, well, some of the outbuildings
are a bit of a writeoff,

11:21.676 --> 11:24.145
so I don't think
they can price it sky-high.

11:24.213 --> 11:25.679
So the building's
a writeoff?!

11:25.747 --> 11:27.648
So what are you gettin'
for your money?

11:27.682 --> 11:29.550
And what money
are you talkin' about?

11:29.585 --> 11:31.118
Dad!

11:31.152 --> 11:32.886
Um, everyone, I have a bit
of an announcement to make.

11:32.921 --> 11:35.489
<i>I'm just saying a bank
wouldn't give you a cup of coffee.</i>

11:35.556 --> 11:36.957
Really? Seriously?

11:36.992 --> 11:38.025
Dad!

11:38.093 --> 11:40.327
Hello! I am being published!

11:40.361 --> 11:43.764
<i>My blog is going to be</i>
<i>published as a book.</i>

11:43.798 --> 11:45.298
That's great, Lou.

11:45.333 --> 11:47.100
<i>Ellen Wigmore, the
editor, I spoke to her today</i>

11:47.135 --> 11:49.336
<i>and she could not</i>
<i>be more positive.</i>

11:49.370 --> 11:51.605
In fact, she even said
it might be a best seller.

11:51.639 --> 11:52.772
Wow!

11:52.806 --> 11:53.973
<i>Yeah, apparently nothing sells</i>

11:54.008 --> 11:56.143
like spicy, juicy details
from real life.

11:56.177 --> 11:58.845
Your blog is about
juggling work and kids.

11:58.879 --> 12:00.680
How is that spicy or juicy?

12:00.714 --> 12:03.983
Okay, for your information, my
life is very spicy and juicy.

12:04.018 --> 12:06.786
Obviously that's why
they're interested.

12:06.820 --> 12:10.890
Okay, well, I'm
gonna go check on Phoenix.

12:14.695 --> 12:16.129
Do you remember Adrian?

12:16.163 --> 12:18.097
<i>That, uh, prince's groom?</i>

12:18.132 --> 12:20.332
<i>Well, apparently they're back</i>
<i>at Hillhurst</i>

12:20.367 --> 12:23.135
and the prince requests
to meet with me.

12:23.170 --> 12:26.104
"Requests."
Wow, that's real friendly.

12:26.139 --> 12:29.375
There's your money, and you
can't buy a dump without money.

12:29.409 --> 12:31.377
And I don't exactly
see the funds pouring in

12:31.411 --> 12:34.813
with your vet student status
and your part time job.

12:34.847 --> 12:38.583
Okay, okay, I have had enough.
Thanks for dinner, Lou.

12:38.617 --> 12:39.584
Uh-huh.

12:39.618 --> 12:41.086
<i>I gotta go.</i>

12:41.120 --> 12:43.221
I have any early start tomorrow
<i>at my loser part-time job.</i>

12:46.225 --> 12:47.625
What? He...

12:49.762 --> 12:51.663
I'm speaking the truth,
that's all.

12:51.698 --> 12:55.066
Well, apparently what I have
accomplished means nothing.

12:57.169 --> 12:58.936
<i>Kids, you know...</i>

13:01.407 --> 13:05.109
I'll tell you this,
I'll tell you this...

13:06.044 --> 13:07.278
Okay, fine.

13:09.014 --> 13:10.915
Ty! Hey!

13:10.982 --> 13:13.084
Don't let my dad get to you,
all right?

13:13.151 --> 13:14.318
I'm trying, Amy.

13:14.385 --> 13:15.953
Every once in a while,
I'd like to pop him one.

13:16.021 --> 13:18.055
Come on, take it easy.

13:18.090 --> 13:20.424
We're gonna get
this place, okay?

13:20.458 --> 13:22.059
We will.

13:24.062 --> 13:26.396
I promise you
we're gonna make this happen.

13:30.735 --> 13:32.736
See ya. 'Kay.

13:33.804 --> 13:35.839
<i>Easy, Phoenix.</i>

13:38.809 --> 13:40.143
When did he come up lame?

13:40.211 --> 13:43.246
Today. Jack thinks
it's a stone bruise.

13:46.784 --> 13:48.184
Uh, yep. Whoa.

13:48.252 --> 13:50.653
I think grandpa's right.

13:50.687 --> 13:54.023
So can you fix it
before it turns into an abscess?

13:54.058 --> 13:55.992
We'll soak his foot
in epsom salt,

13:56.060 --> 13:57.493
and I know my mom
has some remedies

13:57.561 --> 13:59.094
that will help
prevent infection.

14:02.065 --> 14:03.999
Adrian again.

14:04.067 --> 14:06.769
"The prince demands a response."

14:06.836 --> 14:09.505
Demands? I don't think so.

14:22.085 --> 14:24.386
Geez, man, you scared
the heck outta me!

14:24.420 --> 14:27.422
Sorry. I just-I
really needed to talk to you.

14:27.490 --> 14:29.792
You gotta help me out.
Ashley's back.

14:29.859 --> 14:31.326
I heard.

14:31.394 --> 14:34.195
Just tell me what to do.

14:34.263 --> 14:40.134
Well, how do you feel, you know,
seeing her after all this time?

14:40.202 --> 14:46.174
I feel like I'm frozen, and
I'm, like, afraid to unfreeze

14:46.208 --> 14:49.543
'cause I'll crack
and just go to pieces.

14:49.577 --> 14:52.280
She-she left me a voice message.

14:53.448 --> 14:54.548
<i>Hi, cowboy!</i>

14:54.616 --> 14:56.851
<i>Just wondering</i>
<i>what you're doing.</i>

14:56.885 --> 14:58.719
<i>Please don't be afraid</i>
<i>to call me.</i>

14:58.753 --> 15:00.621
<i>You got my number.</i>

15:00.655 --> 15:02.723
Yeah, I got her number
all right.

15:21.876 --> 15:23.276
Good boy.

15:48.736 --> 15:51.136
Hup.

15:53.574 --> 15:54.940
Woo.

15:59.346 --> 16:01.347
Good boy. Whoa.

16:04.484 --> 16:06.085
<i>Liberty training.</i>

16:06.119 --> 16:07.519
Very impressive.

16:09.122 --> 16:10.522
Did you not get the message
from my groom?

16:10.590 --> 16:13.157
<i>You mean from
Adrian, your go-between?</i>

16:17.029 --> 16:18.697
Is that what you expected me
to do?

16:19.999 --> 16:22.501
No, that is not
what I expect you to do,

16:22.535 --> 16:24.469
but I want to know
why you didn't reply.

16:24.537 --> 16:25.871
Have I offended you in some way?

16:25.938 --> 16:27.105
<i>No, not at all.</i>

16:27.172 --> 16:28.273
I just thought
if you wanted to talk to me,

16:28.340 --> 16:30.508
you could come ask me yourself.

16:30.575 --> 16:32.243
I am asking.

16:32.278 --> 16:35.880
I want you to look at a horse
I've just bought.

16:41.086 --> 16:43.421
Adrian! So nice to see you.

16:43.488 --> 16:44.422
You too.

16:44.489 --> 16:46.557
What do you think?

16:46.625 --> 16:48.292
I think he's pretty impressive.

16:48.359 --> 16:50.895
He should be for
what I paid for him,

16:50.962 --> 16:54.064
but I admit,
money did not enter into it.

16:54.132 --> 16:55.566
<i>It was love at first sight,</i>

16:55.634 --> 16:58.302
not something that happens
very often to me.

17:01.005 --> 17:03.006
Whoa! Whoa!
Whoa! Easy, Zeus!

17:03.041 --> 17:05.242
But he's not
performing as he should

17:05.310 --> 17:07.544
and I'm tired
of being disappointed.

17:07.611 --> 17:08.979
I want results.

17:09.047 --> 17:11.348
Take it easy!
Take it easy!

17:11.382 --> 17:14.151
Isn't that right, Adrian?
We want results!

17:14.218 --> 17:16.618
<i>I told you, from the
beginning, this horse is a problem!</i>

17:19.089 --> 17:21.458
Why don't you let the
"miracle girl" have a go?

17:21.492 --> 17:23.560
<i>Of course.</i>

17:39.809 --> 17:41.643
Come on, walk on.

17:45.748 --> 17:47.716
Hey.

17:47.784 --> 17:48.985
<i>Come on.</i>

17:49.953 --> 17:51.319
<i>Move on.</i>

17:54.023 --> 17:56.157
Hey, hey, hey!

17:58.294 --> 18:00.662
Come on, cut it out!

18:01.831 --> 18:02.965
Hey! Hey!

18:02.999 --> 18:04.065
Hey! Hey!

18:13.309 --> 18:14.509
What are you doin'?

18:14.543 --> 18:16.177
Taking the saddle off.

18:16.212 --> 18:17.812
Why?

18:17.846 --> 18:19.614
I have an idea.

18:19.648 --> 18:22.050
Bareback? I don't advise it.

18:29.758 --> 18:32.627
<i>Can you give me a leg up?</i>

18:33.729 --> 18:35.462
Yeah.

18:35.497 --> 18:37.565
One, two, three...

18:39.867 --> 18:41.668
Okay, Zeus.

18:47.075 --> 18:49.143
Hey... it's okay.

18:52.313 --> 18:56.215
We're just gonna take it
nice and easy.

18:56.250 --> 18:58.018
There you go.

18:58.052 --> 18:59.786
Good boy.

19:11.298 --> 19:12.831
<i>You see?</i>

19:12.899 --> 19:14.967
That's how it's done.

19:21.408 --> 19:22.808
Good boy.

19:32.369 --> 19:35.604
You're off the clock early.
What, banker's hours?

19:35.639 --> 19:37.739
Look, Tim,
let's get somethin' straight:

19:37.774 --> 19:39.374
I've only got two more years
of vet school

19:39.408 --> 19:42.177
and Scott said I can pretty much
partner with him once I graduate,

19:42.244 --> 19:43.845
so my future is not lookin'
all that depressing.

19:43.913 --> 19:45.080
That's not what I said.

19:45.114 --> 19:47.082
I said your present
is looking depressing,

19:47.116 --> 19:48.416
so it's probably
not a good time for you

19:48.484 --> 19:50.218
to be lookin' for places
you can't afford.

19:50.252 --> 19:51.186
You know what I mean?

19:57.859 --> 19:58.993
Amy's just like me.

19:59.061 --> 20:01.596
She sees an opportunity,
she jumps on it.

20:08.604 --> 20:09.837
<i>I had fun.</i>

20:09.871 --> 20:12.707
Any time you need help,
just call me - yourself.

20:12.774 --> 20:14.474
Right, no messengers.

20:14.542 --> 20:16.110
<i>okay, see ya.</i>

20:16.144 --> 20:17.544
Amy...

20:18.914 --> 20:20.081
What's this?

20:20.148 --> 20:21.682
It's a cheque.

20:22.718 --> 20:23.784
For what?

20:23.819 --> 20:28.322
I'd like you to work with Zeus,
get to the root of his problem.

20:28.356 --> 20:30.290
But I want you
to concentrate on him,

20:30.358 --> 20:33.293
so you won't have much time
for other clients.

20:33.361 --> 20:34.361
Think about it.

20:44.905 --> 20:46.139
<i>Hey.</i>

20:46.941 --> 20:50.409
Something crazy out of the blue
just happened.

20:51.345 --> 20:53.046
What?! Are you kidding me?

20:53.080 --> 20:54.914
I know.

20:54.949 --> 20:56.549
What's this for?

20:56.617 --> 20:58.351
Don't look at me like that.

20:58.385 --> 21:03.256
He wants me to work with a new horse
of his, Zeus, get him rideable.

21:03.323 --> 21:05.090
Amy, that's a lot of money.

21:05.125 --> 21:08.227
I know. It's a
ridiculous amount of money.

21:10.096 --> 21:11.397
I don't know.

21:11.465 --> 21:14.833
It should be Adrian working
with that horse, not me.

21:14.868 --> 21:17.102
It just would be awkward.

21:17.137 --> 21:20.105
No. You guys have worked
together before with Emir.

21:20.140 --> 21:21.539
He likes you, right?

21:21.574 --> 21:22.908
Yeah, but if you thought
the tension was high

21:22.942 --> 21:26.344
between him and Ahmed before,
you should see it now.

21:26.379 --> 21:29.381
I just don't know if it's a good
idea to get in between them.

21:29.415 --> 21:31.583
Amy, I wouldn't worry
about Adrian.

21:31.617 --> 21:35.086
Yeah? Maybe you're right.

21:36.021 --> 21:38.456
He probably has loads
of other horses to work with.

21:38.491 --> 21:40.925
He's probably relieved to have
Zeus off his plate, right?

21:40.959 --> 21:42.527
Yeah.

21:43.696 --> 21:45.797
I have to say, this is tempting.

21:45.831 --> 21:46.931
I would think so.

21:48.500 --> 21:50.301
And Ty...

21:50.335 --> 21:53.470
We could put this money
down on the ranch.

21:53.505 --> 21:56.140
Yeah, yeah, you could.

21:56.175 --> 21:57.408
Zeus is a gorgeous horse.

21:57.442 --> 22:00.344
I really think
I could do something with him.

22:00.378 --> 22:02.346
What do you think?

22:02.380 --> 22:04.448
I think it's up to you.

22:26.170 --> 22:27.470
I'm glad you called.

22:27.504 --> 22:30.941
Twelve messages are
kinda hard to ignore.

22:30.975 --> 22:34.077
Our favourite lookout.
I forgot how beautiful it is.

22:35.679 --> 22:40.082
Look, ash, I'm kinda
confused, so I have to ask again:

22:40.116 --> 22:41.283
What are you doing here?

22:41.318 --> 22:42.418
I told you.

22:42.453 --> 22:44.554
My mom wanted me
to check on her house.

22:44.588 --> 22:47.022
I don't buy it.
What are you really doing here?

22:47.090 --> 22:51.093
Okay.

22:51.127 --> 22:52.795
I wanted to see
how you were doing.

22:54.397 --> 22:57.799
No. No, that's not a good idea,
not at all.

22:57.834 --> 22:59.068
Why?

22:59.135 --> 23:01.770
I am just starting
to get back to normal.

23:01.838 --> 23:04.840
Well, that's kinda nice to hear;
That I was hard to get over.

23:04.908 --> 23:07.009
<i>I don't think you understand.
I loved you,</i>

23:07.077 --> 23:10.079
I married you,
and I took that very seriously.

23:10.146 --> 23:12.213
Obviously, you didn't.

23:15.585 --> 23:16.985
Yes, I did.

23:20.823 --> 23:22.858
I took it very seriously.

23:24.360 --> 23:26.027
<i>And it's not like</i>
<i>I don't have any regrets,</i>

23:26.095 --> 23:28.462
but if you don't know that
then...

23:35.637 --> 23:36.971
You might take the job?

23:37.039 --> 23:38.739
Yeah, I'm thinkin' about it.

23:38.774 --> 23:40.641
It would be a real challenge
to figure this guy out.

23:40.709 --> 23:42.210
Yeah, the horse
or the prince?

23:42.278 --> 23:44.244
Very funny, grandpa.

23:44.279 --> 23:45.913
Phoenix has been
limping more than ever!

23:45.980 --> 23:48.749
And who's fault is that?

23:48.817 --> 23:50.651
You promised you'd
help me with Phoenix!

23:50.719 --> 23:54.054
<i>I'm not gonna be at
Hillhurst 24-7, okay?</i>

23:54.122 --> 23:57.691
And even if I'm not here, Ty can
help out with Phoenix, right?

23:57.726 --> 24:00.294
Uh, yeah, sure,
I can do that.

24:00.328 --> 24:01.795
You see, it's just
like this book deal;

24:01.829 --> 24:04.965
When life presents you with an
opportunity, you have to grab it!

24:04.999 --> 24:06.934
<i>I just hope it works
out for you, Amy.</i>

24:07.001 --> 24:08.302
Why wouldn't it?

24:08.369 --> 24:09.736
Well, you remember how
you first felt about the guy.

24:09.770 --> 24:11.604
Ty's right about that.

24:11.639 --> 24:12.772
I know you guys
are friends now,

24:12.807 --> 24:14.908
but I'm just saying he could be
an ass when he wanted to be.

24:14.943 --> 24:16.509
You said this was a good idea.

24:16.577 --> 24:17.644
And I guess it is.

24:17.678 --> 24:19.178
You guess it is?!

24:19.246 --> 24:21.347
No, it is, I'm just saying
don't get carried away with it.

24:21.415 --> 24:23.082
I'm hardly getting
carried away, Ty!

24:23.116 --> 24:24.717
You see, this is
what I'm writing about:

24:24.785 --> 24:27.119
Family conflict, juicy details.

24:32.092 --> 24:34.126
Ahmed, hey.

24:34.161 --> 24:37.629
Yes. Yeah, I would love to work
with Zeus.

24:37.664 --> 24:39.731
<i>Yeah, I can start tomorrow.</i>

24:39.766 --> 24:42.268
No, you don't need
to send a car.

24:42.302 --> 24:43.502
I'll see you in the morning.

24:43.536 --> 24:45.938
Bye.

24:47.907 --> 24:50.843
"So Georgie was on her first
school trip away from home"

24:50.877 --> 24:52.243
this past week.

24:52.278 --> 24:54.646
I was hoping she wouldn't miss
Peter and I too badly,

24:54.681 --> 24:56.281
"yada, yada, yada, yada."

24:56.315 --> 24:58.750
<i>My God, this is terrible!</i>

24:59.619 --> 25:01.687
I'm putting myself to sleep.

25:04.090 --> 25:06.424
This is not what they want.

25:10.829 --> 25:12.897
Okay, they want juicy?

25:30.248 --> 25:31.581
Hey, Emir.

25:34.152 --> 25:37.754
Hi, bud, so nice to see you.
Yeah.

25:37.788 --> 25:40.491
He's still terrified
of lightning and thunder.

25:40.558 --> 25:42.159
<i>He probably always will be,</i>

25:42.227 --> 25:45.028
but other than that
he's been very good.

25:45.095 --> 25:48.798
So are you ready
for your next big challenge?

25:48.833 --> 25:50.600
I sure hope so.

25:50.668 --> 25:52.602
Well, we'll see won't we?

25:53.538 --> 25:56.439
Adrian, you're okay with me
working with Zeus, right?

25:56.473 --> 25:59.675
Of course.
I'm glad to have your help.

26:01.678 --> 26:03.413
Hey, Zeus!

26:07.884 --> 26:09.718
Two stallions.

26:09.786 --> 26:12.522
Wouldn't want these guys
to get too close to each other.

26:27.637 --> 26:31.807
<i>He's very moody.
Don't take that personally.</i>

26:31.875 --> 26:33.575
Well, I'm not.

26:45.621 --> 26:48.390
<i>come on, Zeus, settle down!</i>

26:48.458 --> 26:50.491
<i>Hey! Hey!</i>

26:51.660 --> 26:54.361
Whoa, Zeus! Hey!

27:14.782 --> 27:16.917
Hey, Zeus!

27:18.453 --> 27:19.720
<i>Well, it looks
like even "miracle girl"</i>

27:19.754 --> 27:21.489
can have an off day.

27:34.611 --> 27:37.679
So? What do you guys think?

27:37.713 --> 27:41.683
I mean these are just some
sample chapters I whipped off.

27:41.717 --> 27:43.285
<i>Come on, somebody say something.</i>

27:43.320 --> 27:47.056
Wow! Thanks, Lou.
So I really am a loser.

27:48.524 --> 27:50.359
I gotta go give Phoenix
some antibiotics.

27:50.393 --> 27:51.660
Antibiotics? Why
don't you just use

27:51.694 --> 27:54.195
my mom's recipe
for the poultice?

27:54.229 --> 27:56.698
If you want to do
that, Amy, you can.

27:56.732 --> 27:58.132
Grandpa?

28:00.603 --> 28:02.203
What do you think?

28:02.237 --> 28:04.372
<i>Did you have to go on
and on about my heart attack?</i>

28:04.406 --> 28:07.876
You even got some crazy mushy
stuff about Lisa and me in here.

28:07.910 --> 28:10.111
<i>Illegitimate child.</i>

28:10.145 --> 28:14.648
Drug and alcohol abuse, not
to mention you make me look

28:14.683 --> 28:16.784
like some egotistical
opportunist.

28:16.818 --> 28:19.553
<i>"Unpredictable
with anger issues."</i>

28:19.588 --> 28:21.755
You make me sound
like I'm some spoiled brat

28:21.823 --> 28:24.025
who never does what I'm told!

28:24.059 --> 28:25.793
<i>Nobody's gonna read this.</i>

28:25.827 --> 28:28.629
<i>It's like make-believe.</i>
<i>It's all exaggerated.</i>

28:28.663 --> 28:31.699
Of course it's exaggerated!
I had to spice it up a bit!

28:31.733 --> 28:33.233
I mean, what did you think
I would do?

28:33.267 --> 28:34.768
It's pure Pulp Fiction!

28:34.803 --> 28:37.104
Do you want the publisher
to just dump the whole project

28:37.171 --> 28:38.305
and forget about
the whole thing?

28:38.339 --> 28:39.272
Is that what you want?

28:39.340 --> 28:41.274
I don't want anybody reading it.

28:41.309 --> 28:44.444
How am I gonna face anyone
at school?

28:49.717 --> 28:50.750
Amy?

28:50.784 --> 28:53.186
"Socially awkward
around people."

28:53.254 --> 28:55.922
You make me sound like I love
horses more than I do people.

28:55.956 --> 28:58.191
Actually, that's the one part
that's true.

28:58.259 --> 29:00.627
No it isn't, Lou.

29:01.929 --> 29:04.130
You know, I've had
a really bad day today

29:04.164 --> 29:05.832
and this didn't make things
any better.

29:05.900 --> 29:08.935
Really? How bad?
Maybe I can use it.

29:09.904 --> 29:12.371
Lou. No,
I just meant- Amy!

29:14.642 --> 29:16.675
Why, grandpa?
Why doesn't anyone understand

29:16.743 --> 29:19.378
what a huge opportunity
this is for me?

29:19.446 --> 29:20.746
Is it worth getting published

29:20.813 --> 29:22.281
if you have to lie
to make it happen?

29:22.349 --> 29:23.549
<i>I'm not lying!</i>

29:23.583 --> 29:25.251
I'm just stretching things
a bit.

29:25.318 --> 29:28.487
Whatever you want to call it.

29:29.456 --> 29:33.659
Fine! I'll call the publisher and
tell them I changed my mind!

29:40.399 --> 29:42.834
So Phoenix is doing
a little better.

29:42.902 --> 29:44.202
I'm glad.

29:48.007 --> 29:49.507
Rough day?

29:49.575 --> 29:51.342
You could say that.

29:52.311 --> 29:56.647
It didn't go well, with
Zeus, with Adrian.

29:56.682 --> 30:01.252
He couldn't hide his obvious joy
that I wasn't making any progress,

30:01.320 --> 30:04.355
and Ahmed barely said
two words to me.

30:06.257 --> 30:09.326
Maybe I shouldn't have
taken it on.

30:12.197 --> 30:13.965
You don't want this to work,
do you?

30:15.567 --> 30:17.334
What?

30:17.402 --> 30:18.970
I can just feel it.

30:19.905 --> 30:23.607
No, Amy, of course I want this
to work for you.

30:23.674 --> 30:26.276
Well, then what is it?
'Cause something's going on.

30:26.344 --> 30:29.213
No, nothing's going on, it's...
Ty...

30:30.681 --> 30:32.882
Is it Ahmed?
I know you don't like him.

30:32.917 --> 30:36.553
It's not Ahmed.
I don't even know the guy.

30:37.489 --> 30:38.888
It's just...

30:40.357 --> 30:42.458
It's just what?

30:42.493 --> 30:44.560
I don't know, I guess...

30:44.595 --> 30:45.996
I wanted to be the one
to make the money

30:46.030 --> 30:50.800
and to put the down payment
on the place, you know?

30:50.835 --> 30:53.637
Wait, are you serious?

30:54.605 --> 30:58.574
What does it matter
if it's your money or my money?

31:00.043 --> 31:02.411
It doesn't matter, Amy,
I'm just...

31:02.446 --> 31:04.514
I feel that...

31:06.350 --> 31:08.417
I don't know, I...

31:09.486 --> 31:11.521
Forget it, forget it, okay?
It's fine.

31:11.555 --> 31:13.789
I don't believe you.

31:26.803 --> 31:28.370
Amy!

31:28.404 --> 31:30.205
Amy!

31:30.239 --> 31:32.740
Amy, what do you think
you're doing?

31:32.775 --> 31:35.676
You can't just take Zeus out of
his stable without permission!

31:35.743 --> 31:38.111
And he doesn't train here,
he trains in the indoor arena!

31:38.146 --> 31:39.746
He just needs a change, okay?

31:39.781 --> 31:42.249
He needs to be out, free,
in the open, without walls.

31:42.284 --> 31:43.350
He needs to be a horse.

31:43.385 --> 31:44.585
<i>Oh, does he?</i>

31:44.619 --> 31:45.919
Well, I'm still
the head groom here.

31:45.953 --> 31:49.156
It's still my job to tell the prince
when I disagree with something,

31:49.191 --> 31:51.291
and I intend to do just that.

31:51.325 --> 31:53.160
Okay. Prince Ahmed hired me

31:53.194 --> 31:54.561
to do what I think is best
for the horse,

31:54.595 --> 31:56.629
and this is what
I think is best!

31:58.199 --> 32:00.701
I need to speak to the prince.

32:00.768 --> 32:02.135
Well, where is he?

32:02.170 --> 32:04.237
Let's try this.

32:07.175 --> 32:09.609
Good boy. Switch, switch.

32:11.378 --> 32:12.912
Hey, settle down!

32:18.785 --> 32:20.286
Good boy.

32:32.498 --> 32:34.166
That's it!

32:41.474 --> 32:42.507
<i>Easy.</i>

32:44.510 --> 32:46.278
<i>Do you know what I think</i>
<i>his problem is?</i>

32:46.346 --> 32:48.813
I think he was started badly.

32:48.881 --> 32:51.483
He really needs to go
back to basics.

32:51.551 --> 32:53.418
You know, it's almost like
he has a little bit

32:53.486 --> 32:55.287
of a-d-d or something.

32:55.321 --> 32:58.356
And you think this kind
of liberty work will help?

32:58.423 --> 32:59.590
Yeah, I do.

32:59.625 --> 33:01.059
It will definitely help
his concentration.

33:01.093 --> 33:02.761
Zeus!

33:02.828 --> 33:04.662
<i>Here, Zeus!</i>

33:04.696 --> 33:07.766
Hey, my!
It's definitely a start!

33:07.800 --> 33:09.768
Yes, it's a very good start.

33:09.835 --> 33:13.437
Zeus is not a liberty horse.
Zeus is a jumper.

33:13.505 --> 33:15.306
<i>Now, if you'd like to take him</i>
<i>down to Las Vegas</i>

33:15.374 --> 33:19.477
and introduce him to the circus,
that's fine, but we don't.

33:19.511 --> 33:22.045
I really think you're gonna get
the results you're looking for.

33:22.080 --> 33:23.781
Yeah, and I think
I'm just gonna keep training him

33:23.848 --> 33:25.082
the way I'm used to.

33:25.116 --> 33:29.086
Actually, Adrian, the horse
only needs one master,

33:29.120 --> 33:31.955
so I think Amy's better off
with Zeus on her own.

33:31.990 --> 33:33.757
Really?

33:33.825 --> 33:36.626
Amy, with Zeus, on her own.

33:36.694 --> 33:41.564
Yes, I'm seeing some
improvement for the first time.

33:41.599 --> 33:42.666
Carry on, Amy.

33:43.601 --> 33:44.935
Thank you.

33:46.904 --> 33:50.106
Oh, yes, please, carry on, Amy.

33:50.174 --> 33:54.577
Your time might be better
spent exercising Jigsaw.

33:54.612 --> 33:56.879
So I'm relegated
to a second string horse

33:56.914 --> 33:59.215
with a novice trainer,
is that it?

33:59.283 --> 34:03.152
You had your chance with Zeus and
it clearly wasn't successful.

34:11.650 --> 34:16.543
<i>Ellen, I hate to say it,</i>
<i>but I can't do it.</i>

34:16.610 --> 34:19.645
I've spiced up my blog
just to make it interesting,

34:19.679 --> 34:24.216
put in all the spicy, gory, juicy
bits your publisher wants...

34:24.250 --> 34:26.886
Sorry, what do you mean?

34:26.920 --> 34:30.089
My family feels betrayed
and I don't blame them.

34:30.123 --> 34:31.456
Look...

34:31.492 --> 34:34.626
My blog is about my real life,
my real experiences,

34:34.659 --> 34:38.030
my real family, and if
you people liked it

34:38.063 --> 34:40.632
the way it was in the first place,
enough to offer me the book deal,

34:40.666 --> 34:43.235
then I don't see
why I should change it!

34:43.268 --> 34:46.505
And I won't, <i>even if it
means losing the book deal.</i>

34:46.539 --> 34:49.741
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

34:49.809 --> 34:51.476
Who asked you
to change anything?

34:51.511 --> 34:55.246
But you said that it's the gory,
juicy bits that make a best seller,

34:55.313 --> 34:58.483
and I have no gory, juicy bits.

34:58.518 --> 35:00.685
What I said was our
readers want to feel like

35:00.720 --> 35:03.054
they're sharing
someone else's life.

35:03.088 --> 35:05.289
They want the truth, not lies.

35:05.324 --> 35:07.358
That's why we liked your blog.

35:07.393 --> 35:08.792
Oh.

35:09.961 --> 35:12.963
Please just send us
your favourite entries

35:12.998 --> 35:14.632
and I'll get them
to my publisher.

35:14.666 --> 35:16.000
Really?

35:16.035 --> 35:17.301
Really.

35:17.336 --> 35:19.904
And if you could do that sooner
rather than later that'd be great,

35:19.971 --> 35:21.139
because we're already organizing
a book tour.

35:21.206 --> 35:24.542
A, a book tour? Okay. Done.

35:24.609 --> 35:26.443
I will get them to you asap.

35:26.511 --> 35:27.611
<i>Super!</i>

35:27.646 --> 35:29.212
Sorry if there was
a misunderstanding.

35:29.247 --> 35:30.447
Not at all.

35:30.481 --> 35:31.481
<i>Let's talk soon.</i>

35:31.583 --> 35:33.951
Bye!

35:35.453 --> 35:37.855
A book tour?

35:41.592 --> 35:44.961
Look who left 10 messages
this time!

35:45.029 --> 35:46.129
Hard to ignore.

35:46.197 --> 35:47.531
<i>Yeah, well,</i>

35:47.598 --> 35:49.132
<i>I didn't really like</i>
<i>how we left things off, so...</i>

35:49.167 --> 35:50.333
I'm glad.

35:50.401 --> 35:53.236
It'll be good to clear the air.

35:53.304 --> 35:56.338
Caleb, we used to be friends -

35:56.373 --> 35:58.908
<i>good friends -</i>
<i>before you... we...</i>

35:58.976 --> 36:01.110
You know, got married.

36:02.079 --> 36:04.047
Maybe we could be friends again?

36:04.114 --> 36:06.182
You want to be friends?

36:06.249 --> 36:07.249
Yes.

36:07.317 --> 36:09.351
After what you did to us? To me?

36:09.419 --> 36:11.520
<i>What I did to you?</i>

36:11.588 --> 36:12.854
It wasn't just my fault!

36:12.889 --> 36:15.157
We wanted different things!
We grew apart!

36:15.225 --> 36:17.626
<i>We didn't grow apart!
You grew apart!</i>

36:17.660 --> 36:19.095
I moved to Vancouver
to be with you!

36:19.129 --> 36:21.330
I gave up my career
to be with you!

36:21.398 --> 36:23.665
I tried, Ashley, I really did,
but you could have cared less!

36:23.700 --> 36:24.833
That's not true!

36:24.867 --> 36:26.202
No, it was pretty obvious to me

36:26.269 --> 36:28.003
you just want your little
college life all on your own.

36:28.071 --> 36:30.238
Okay...

36:30.306 --> 36:33.341
Maybe I was
a little self-involved,

36:34.410 --> 36:37.012
but that doesn't mean
that we can't be close again.

36:39.048 --> 36:42.684
You really don't understand
how bad you hurt me, do you?

36:42.752 --> 36:44.586
I'm really sorry I called.
I shouldn't have.

36:44.653 --> 36:47.388
This obviously
isn't going anywhere.

36:54.997 --> 36:57.999
Ashley, don't! Come on!

37:00.136 --> 37:01.702
You're right.

37:01.737 --> 37:06.340
I wasn't thinking about you,
I was thinking of myself.

37:06.374 --> 37:09.309
I wanted a student life,
not a married life.

37:09.377 --> 37:10.344
Just go!

37:10.378 --> 37:11.411
<i>No!</i>

37:11.479 --> 37:15.215
I'm happy you said what you said,
because it made me realize

37:15.250 --> 37:19.052
how much I care about you
more than anything!

37:40.807 --> 37:42.875
<i>You put in a long day.</i>

37:42.909 --> 37:45.110
I know it doesn't feel
like much is happening,

37:45.145 --> 37:47.379
but I really want
to take it slow with Zeus.

37:47.413 --> 37:49.214
We'll do the liberty work
before I even attempt

37:49.248 --> 37:50.916
to saddle or ride him.

37:50.950 --> 37:54.153
It's gonna take some time though,
so I hope you understand.

37:54.187 --> 37:57.355
It's worth it and we have time.

37:59.192 --> 38:00.625
You know...

38:00.693 --> 38:03.928
I never got a chance
to tell you how much your gift,

38:03.962 --> 38:06.631
the "miracle girl" saddle,
meant to me.

38:06.666 --> 38:11.436
It really was more than a
present, it was an inspiration.

38:13.706 --> 38:15.106
Thank you.

38:29.754 --> 38:31.522
What the hell are you doing?!

38:31.556 --> 38:32.756
<i>Drinking?!</i>

38:32.790 --> 38:34.825
<i>Broken glass for the horses</i>
<i>to step on?!</i>

38:34.859 --> 38:36.960
If I ever see you with a bottle
in here again...

38:36.994 --> 38:38.696
What?

38:39.931 --> 38:41.599
What?! Tell me
what you're gonna do!

38:44.502 --> 38:47.003
Adrian, I've talked to you
about this before.

38:47.071 --> 38:49.539
You're drunk! Go home!

38:49.607 --> 38:52.375
Oh, "go home." Is that an order?

38:52.409 --> 38:53.710
Is that an order, your highness?

38:53.778 --> 38:56.379
Is that an order, sir?

38:56.447 --> 38:57.748
Yes, it is.

38:59.183 --> 39:01.985
You don't talk to me like that.

39:02.053 --> 39:03.353
You just don't get it, do you?

39:03.420 --> 39:05.521
You just don't get it!
The stable hands,

39:05.556 --> 39:07.857
they're already laughin' at me!

39:07.924 --> 39:10.526
Don't be ridiculous!
You're head groom!

39:10.594 --> 39:12.962
Now pick that mess up
and then go and sleep it off!

39:12.996 --> 39:15.765
Don't you walk away from me!

39:15.832 --> 39:18.601
You count the years that
I worked for your father.

39:18.669 --> 39:22.471
He never woulda treated me
like this.

39:22.538 --> 39:26.575
But then you're not
half the man he was.

39:29.780 --> 39:32.681
You're just a little boy,
aren't ya?

39:32.749 --> 39:36.551
You're just a little boy
in a man's world.

39:37.487 --> 39:39.755
You've been drinking again!

39:39.822 --> 39:42.691
You put the horses in danger!

39:42.725 --> 39:44.793
You're fired!

40:24.643 --> 40:29.047
It's okay, Phoenix.
It's just thunder.

40:29.982 --> 40:33.251
The antibiotics Ty gave Phoenix
are really helping.

40:33.285 --> 40:34.586
So is this.

40:34.620 --> 40:38.656
And I'm not saying
that antibiotics are bad, but...

40:40.959 --> 40:43.294
Is this your mom's concoction?

40:43.329 --> 40:44.729
Peat moss and pine tar.

40:44.763 --> 40:46.030
Ah.

40:46.064 --> 40:47.265
All right,
well, I'm pushing off.

40:47.333 --> 40:48.566
I've got some studying to do.
See you later?

40:48.601 --> 40:49.900
Okay, see ya.

40:49.935 --> 40:51.869
Oh, great, not again.
I gotta go.

40:53.872 --> 40:54.939
Now? Why?

40:56.141 --> 40:58.342
'Cause with the storm
Emir's freaking out in his stall

40:58.376 --> 40:59.977
and they need me
to settle him down.

41:00.011 --> 41:01.311
Well, they got plenty of
stable hands to handle that.

41:01.346 --> 41:02.446
You don't have to go, Amy.

41:02.480 --> 41:04.982
Yeah, and you were gonna help
me put the poultice on Phoenix!

41:05.016 --> 41:06.117
Why don't you just give him
a call back,

41:06.151 --> 41:07.118
tell him you're busy right now.

41:07.185 --> 41:08.252
<i>No, I have to, okay?</i>

41:08.286 --> 41:10.187
Emir could be hurt.
I've gotta be there.

41:10.222 --> 41:12.088
You can help Georgie
with the poultice.

41:14.525 --> 41:16.326
Okay, fine. Go.

41:16.361 --> 41:18.428
Okay, fine, I will.

41:19.897 --> 41:21.365
Okay.

41:22.600 --> 41:24.635
All right, Georgie,
let's get this done.

41:24.669 --> 41:25.702
All right.

41:48.325 --> 41:49.858
Yah!

42:00.636 --> 42:01.904
Ahmed?!

42:08.011 --> 42:09.812
Zeus! Hey!

42:09.879 --> 42:11.947
Hey! Stop this!

42:13.082 --> 42:15.117
Emir! Zeus!

42:19.087 --> 42:20.922
Emir, get back!

42:22.090 --> 42:24.125
Hey, settle! Settle!

42:25.994 --> 42:28.563
Come on, Emir, it's okay!

42:28.564 --> 44:06.104
