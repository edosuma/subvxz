00:01.034 --> 00:03.315
<i>Previously on Kyle XY...</i>

00:05.506 --> 00:07.865
- The thought of you two living together
- It's not like that.

00:07.965 --> 00:09.759
She needs a place to live, a family.

00:09.927 --> 00:12.345
- I know, but...
- You're the only one for me.

00:12.634 --> 00:14.518
- I never caught your name.
- Jessi.

00:14.618 --> 00:15.552
I'm Cassidy.

00:15.652 --> 00:17.953
I've counseled a lot of
teenagers over the years.

00:18.053 --> 00:19.810
I have never given up on any of them.

00:19.978 --> 00:21.520
I'm not giving up on you.

00:21.688 --> 00:24.190
I heard you've been spending
time with Lori Trager.

00:24.358 --> 00:26.703
- We're just hanging out.
- Not anymore.

00:27.528 --> 00:28.444
There you are.

00:28.612 --> 00:31.379
- I don't know how to say this.
- Mark told me he won't date me

00:31.479 --> 00:33.699
- because he's afraid for his future.
- Good. He should be.

00:33.867 --> 00:35.826
Why do you get to decide who
I can go out with?

00:35.994 --> 00:37.970
Because I'm your father
and you live in my house.

00:38.070 --> 00:39.410
I thought you'd be with Andy.

00:39.510 --> 00:41.791
Her mom extended their vacation
rental another 3 weeks.

00:41.959 --> 00:43.567
I just really miss her.

00:43.667 --> 00:45.586
With Kyle I'm just a sidekick.

00:46.092 --> 00:49.838
But out here I'd sink 'em half
the time with my eyes closed.

00:50.342 --> 00:52.944
What did you do to Amanda?
You put something in her head.

00:53.044 --> 00:55.137
We might be able to disintegrate it.
I'd like to help.

00:55.305 --> 00:57.632
- You've done enough.
- Kyle, that's it.

00:59.132 --> 01:02.728
Pass the electricity through
a kiss. You'll have to practice.

01:03.008 --> 01:05.438
- Are you ready?
- Just try to be gentle.

01:08.015 --> 01:11.362
- Amanda, let me explain.
- You are always trying to explain.

01:11.565 --> 01:14.104
But there is no explanation
for why you were kissing Jessi!

01:14.204 --> 01:16.494
I can feel what's happening
between you two.

01:16.780 --> 01:20.195
But I can't be with you when I know
I'm losing you to someone else.

01:20.295 --> 01:22.873
- You can never lose me.
- I already have.

01:29.196 --> 01:30.780
<i>The call it heartache,</i>

01:30.880 --> 01:33.475
<i>a hurt so profound
it becomes hard to breathe.</i>

01:33.683 --> 01:35.389
<i>I had never felt it before,</i>

01:35.489 --> 01:36.657
<i>and I wondered,</i>

01:36.757 --> 01:38.276
<i>will it ever go away?</i>

01:43.541 --> 01:45.651
I know you're hurting over Amanda.

01:46.182 --> 01:47.861
But you have to stop obsessing.

01:47.961 --> 01:50.109
And I have just the distraction.

01:52.086 --> 01:54.386
The allure of a new woman.

01:55.302 --> 01:57.575
See? Many new women.

01:57.818 --> 02:00.412
Two dimensional, yes,
but still satisfying.

02:00.512 --> 02:03.344
It's a safe, easy escape
with someone you love.

02:04.325 --> 02:05.147
You!

02:07.736 --> 02:10.098
Let music be your relief,
your way out.

02:10.494 --> 02:13.023
You're wallowing in sorrow,
you're depressed.

02:13.123 --> 02:15.259
You're pining.
You need A minor.

02:18.022 --> 02:20.526
Come on, now.
With more feeling. Commit.

02:23.832 --> 02:24.793
Great.

02:27.248 --> 02:29.365
Trust me, you're not
the first guy to get dumped.

02:29.465 --> 02:31.073
Think of it as a rite of passage.

02:31.173 --> 02:33.360
Mine was tenth grade,
Beth Ann Johnson.

02:33.644 --> 02:36.052
Beautiful, adventurous, a gymnast.

02:36.683 --> 02:37.562
Deadly.

02:38.404 --> 02:39.755
Stick with me, now.

02:46.887 --> 02:47.994
I'm ready.

02:49.341 --> 02:50.815
What are you doing?

02:50.915 --> 02:52.901
Wiping Amanda from Kyle's memory.

02:54.905 --> 02:56.325
Could you give us a minute?

02:56.425 --> 02:58.969
- But I'm all charged up.
- Jessi, please.

03:03.834 --> 03:06.745
Fine. I'll just go
zap someone else, then.

03:08.734 --> 03:10.002
I'm kidding.

03:14.235 --> 03:15.738
She is kidding, right?

03:19.280 --> 03:20.974
What you're going through takes time.

03:21.074 --> 03:22.409
But it will take even longer

03:22.509 --> 03:24.730
the more you lay around here
and feel sorry for yourself.

03:24.830 --> 03:28.325
It's time to get up, or man up,
whatever the phrase is these days.

03:28.425 --> 03:31.362
- Man up?
- Out of the tub. Now.

03:32.876 --> 03:37.260
Either that or fill it with soap
and water because you stink.

03:38.717 --> 03:39.606
Come on.

<font color=#00FFFF>Season 3 Episode 4:
In The Company Of Men</font>

04:21.565 --> 04:23.670
- We should go.
- Sit.

04:26.208 --> 04:28.246
I thought Amanda
didn't work on Fridays.

04:28.346 --> 04:29.671
You know her schedule?

04:29.771 --> 04:31.369
That's so co-dependent.

04:33.184 --> 04:35.624
I've been reading
some of Nicole's books.

04:36.064 --> 04:38.903
Like it or not, you're gonna see her.
She lives next door,

04:39.071 --> 04:40.481
so get used to it.

04:42.171 --> 04:44.354
- If you want my advice...
- We don't.

04:46.113 --> 04:48.270
I can't believe
he came in here with her.

04:48.370 --> 04:51.550
- Who?
- Please. I saw your jaw clinch.

04:51.895 --> 04:54.613
By the way, don't grind or
you'll get really bad TMJ

04:54.713 --> 04:57.375
and have to eat creamed spinach
the rest of your life.

04:57.656 --> 05:01.124
- Do they look like a couple?
- Pumpkin, don't torture yourself.

05:01.538 --> 05:03.721
Just look over there and tell me.

05:05.995 --> 05:08.249
I see a decided lack
of chemistry.

05:09.030 --> 05:11.284
Nothing like what
Ky-manda exuded.

05:13.802 --> 05:16.062
- She just looked over here.
- She did?

05:16.162 --> 05:18.346
Don't look back. She'll see you.

05:19.085 --> 05:21.820
- Where should I look?
- Anywhere. Here, look at me.

05:21.988 --> 05:24.692
Yeah. Yeah, look deep into
Trager's eyes.

05:24.885 --> 05:26.237
That's not weird.

05:26.898 --> 05:28.248
Kyle, look at me.

05:31.308 --> 05:34.559
I don't think that's a good idea.
As a matter of fact,

05:34.659 --> 05:37.189
maybe you shouldn't be
sitting next to me.

05:37.852 --> 05:40.451
Maybe I should just sit
at another table.

05:42.126 --> 05:44.026
I'll make it easier for you.

05:44.126 --> 05:45.226
Jessi, wait.

05:52.153 --> 05:53.310
Feeling better?

06:04.351 --> 06:06.115
Are you using your car?

06:06.933 --> 06:08.736
What? I couldn't hear you.

06:08.981 --> 06:11.078
Could I borrow your car, please?

06:11.807 --> 06:12.612
For?

06:13.766 --> 06:15.118
I want to go out.

06:15.715 --> 06:16.729
Where to?

06:17.789 --> 06:18.877
I'm not sure.

06:20.160 --> 06:22.665
What, you just gonna
drive around aimlessly?

06:22.765 --> 06:24.680
Can I borrow your car or not?

06:24.780 --> 06:25.676
Josh has it.

06:26.652 --> 06:28.595
Josh has the car?
Josh has a car.

06:28.695 --> 06:30.433
His radiator's busted
so he took mine.

06:30.533 --> 06:32.403
You couldn't just say that
in the first place?

06:32.503 --> 06:35.130
And be straight with you? Like
you were when you went to see Mark?

06:35.230 --> 06:37.162
Passive-aggressive
doesn't really suit you.

06:37.262 --> 06:40.394
- You lied to me, Lori.
- You gave me a good reason to.

06:51.936 --> 06:53.557
Jessi, is that you?

06:56.341 --> 06:58.890
Hey, come on in.
I was just looking at these colors.

06:58.990 --> 07:00.289
Any preferences?

07:01.928 --> 07:04.029
For the walls.
Any preferences?

07:05.702 --> 07:07.898
Not really.
Any color's fine.

07:08.788 --> 07:10.322
It's gonna be your room.

07:10.422 --> 07:12.097
I want you to feel comfortable.

07:15.375 --> 07:16.810
Something bothering you?

07:17.975 --> 07:18.910
No.

07:19.471 --> 07:20.481
I'm sorry.

07:20.861 --> 07:23.400
- I shouldn't...
- Why are you sorry?

07:23.687 --> 07:24.644
Habit.

07:25.250 --> 07:28.529
Being in this room, I guess,
trying to get people to open up.

07:29.466 --> 07:31.825
Just know you can talk to me
whenever you want to.

07:32.476 --> 07:34.673
In this room or not in this room.

07:41.876 --> 07:42.673
Nicole...

07:44.476 --> 07:45.673
Yeah?

07:47.071 --> 07:49.797
- I feel...
- That daughter of yours!

07:50.937 --> 07:52.336
Hey Jessi.

07:53.937 --> 07:55.336
This green's fine.

08:05.967 --> 08:08.014
- I should talk to her.
- Bad idea.

08:08.114 --> 08:11.031
- I could explain.
- What? Why you kissed another girl?

08:11.199 --> 08:13.605
Right in front of her?
You can't take that back.

08:13.705 --> 08:16.036
You're finished, Kyle.
It's over.

08:16.769 --> 08:18.700
Way to lift his spirits, dude.

08:21.710 --> 08:23.490
Come on.
We're getting out of here.

08:23.590 --> 08:26.309
- Where are we going?
- I've got just the cure.

08:35.953 --> 08:36.974
Good magazine?

08:37.327 --> 08:39.700
If by good you mean
trashy and trivial and

08:39.799 --> 08:42.855
completely devoid of journalistic
value, then yes, it's fantastic.

08:43.989 --> 08:45.250
I'll leave you alone.

08:45.562 --> 08:46.492
Wait.

08:46.784 --> 08:48.938
You don't have to.
It's not you.

08:49.088 --> 08:50.112
Who is it?

08:50.500 --> 08:52.903
My father. He's unbelievable.

08:53.003 --> 08:55.345
He's got this bug up his ass
about Mark.

08:55.613 --> 08:56.510
A bug?

08:58.492 --> 09:00.993
He's pulling this big
power trip on me.

09:01.931 --> 09:04.026
And now I am stuck here,

09:04.288 --> 09:05.287
carless

09:05.866 --> 09:07.418
with no place to go.

09:07.518 --> 09:09.482
I wish I had a place of my own.

09:09.582 --> 09:10.382
I do.

09:11.981 --> 09:14.382
The apartment.
I still have the keys.

09:15.047 --> 09:16.748
What are we waiting for?

09:16.848 --> 09:18.807
There's really nothing
to do there.

09:18.975 --> 09:21.150
It doesn't matter.
It's not here.

09:22.366 --> 09:23.624
Are you coming?

09:44.187 --> 09:45.276
Is this spot OK?

09:45.376 --> 09:47.333
It's fine.
I parked here a million times.

09:47.433 --> 09:48.641
Where are we?

09:48.741 --> 09:51.089
Kyle, my friend,
we're at a Seattle landmark.

09:51.257 --> 09:54.132
Little-known watering hole,
tradition passed on from generation

09:54.232 --> 09:56.452
- to generation of teenagers.
- What is it?

09:56.552 --> 09:58.660
A bar that doesn't check IDs.

09:58.913 --> 10:00.598
Isn't that illegal?

10:00.745 --> 10:02.998
Tonight isn't about technicalities.

10:03.098 --> 10:04.550
It's about letting loose,

10:04.650 --> 10:07.232
it's about seeing how much fun
life can be post-Amanda.

10:07.332 --> 10:08.990
So, why are we at a bar?

10:15.661 --> 10:17.167
You don't even have cable?

10:17.267 --> 10:19.558
I told you
there's nothing to do here.

10:21.829 --> 10:23.528
Hi, Jessi. How are you?

10:24.118 --> 10:25.559
How are you doing?

10:26.961 --> 10:29.086
What are you two ladies
up to this evening?

10:31.343 --> 10:32.815
What did you have in mind?

10:32.915 --> 10:35.759
I was gonna go meet a friend
for coffee. Any suggestions?

10:36.679 --> 10:37.821
Try the Rack.

10:38.698 --> 10:40.351
God, no.
It's totally lame.

10:40.723 --> 10:41.515
I'll check out.

10:43.148 --> 10:45.143
Actually, their lattes are amazing.

10:47.529 --> 10:49.018
Well, we have to go.

10:49.665 --> 10:51.656
Cool. Maybe I'll see you later?

10:52.210 --> 10:53.026
Maybe.

10:58.295 --> 11:00.197
What's the matter with you?

11:01.192 --> 11:02.765
Ladies, looking good.

11:03.524 --> 11:05.602
You want to take it down a notch?

11:06.742 --> 11:07.726
Ladies.

11:21.305 --> 11:23.175
That girl keeps smiling at me.

11:23.863 --> 11:27.008
- She likes you, dude.
- She doesn't even know me.

11:27.108 --> 11:28.640
She feels the heat.

11:35.326 --> 11:37.619
See? Everyone's having
a great time.

11:39.985 --> 11:41.356
I don't think so, little man.

11:41.703 --> 11:43.853
- You're kidding me, right?
- Your dad would kill me.

11:43.953 --> 11:45.957
You're our designated driver.

11:46.157 --> 11:47.195
This sucks.

11:47.295 --> 11:48.869
What are you doing?

11:49.959 --> 11:51.071
I just...

11:51.637 --> 11:53.045
Are you calling Amanda?

11:55.152 --> 11:57.341
Dude, you're missing the point.
Forget Amanda.

11:57.509 --> 11:58.411
Forget her?

11:58.511 --> 12:01.050
Dude, you've been in that room
for days. You've got tub sores.

12:01.150 --> 12:03.528
You're in pain.
Forgetting her is a good thing.

12:04.001 --> 12:05.126
This will help.

12:06.085 --> 12:06.964
Wait.

12:07.064 --> 12:09.477
I tried that once
and I did not like it.

12:09.776 --> 12:11.468
You didn't do it right.

12:11.568 --> 12:13.260
Just do it. Come on.

12:33.304 --> 12:35.429
And the wife says,
"That's not a pig."

12:35.529 --> 12:38.279
And the guy says,
"I wasn't talking to you."

12:40.293 --> 12:41.543
I don't get it.

12:41.879 --> 12:44.631
What are you talking about, man?
It's ingenious.

12:45.703 --> 12:48.767
- What?
- Everything is vibrating or something.

12:49.595 --> 12:51.096
- Really?
- Yes.

12:51.416 --> 12:53.146
I feel a distinct hum.

12:53.342 --> 12:55.563
- Dude, you're buzzed.
- Buzzed?

12:56.365 --> 12:58.025
Alcohol's kicking in.

13:00.870 --> 13:02.129
I'm buzzed.

13:04.862 --> 13:07.973
This is cool. Just us guys,
bonding over lady trouble.

13:08.073 --> 13:09.746
What kind of lady trouble
do you have?

13:10.011 --> 13:12.003
Dude, Andy's been out of town
for two weeks.

13:12.103 --> 13:14.282
And when she's here
she can be a real ball buster.

13:14.382 --> 13:16.905
Talking about ball buster,
try your sister.

13:17.005 --> 13:19.387
Please. I've had to live
with that for 16 years.

13:19.487 --> 13:21.758
Why would you ever
be with her by choice?

13:21.978 --> 13:24.553
Her dining habits alone.
The way she slurps...

13:26.086 --> 13:27.555
You ever watch Hillary eat?

13:27.655 --> 13:31.163
Tiny nibbles. She, like,
flosses after every bite.

13:34.928 --> 13:36.783
Andy doesn't wear deodorant.

13:37.692 --> 13:39.317
There. I said it.

13:40.686 --> 13:42.515
What do you have on Amanda?

13:44.241 --> 13:47.791
I haven't thought about Amanda
for 6 minutes and 14 seconds.

13:48.202 --> 13:49.753
It's working!

14:04.861 --> 14:06.692
<i>They called it male bonding.</i>

14:07.096 --> 14:09.764
<i>An exercise in forgetting our problems.</i>

14:09.932 --> 14:12.392
<i>And the girls
who had caused them.</i>

14:12.560 --> 14:16.242
<i>I wasn't sure why I had to drink myself
full of chemicals to achieve it,</i>

14:16.342 --> 14:19.154
<i>but they clearly felt
like I needed the help.</i>

14:28.760 --> 14:30.202
Dude, the head.

14:31.057 --> 14:32.077
The head?

14:32.535 --> 14:33.803
I love you guys.

14:34.628 --> 14:35.990
I love you, too.

14:37.114 --> 14:39.543
No, you gotta add the guys, man.

14:41.460 --> 14:42.296
Guys.

14:42.964 --> 14:44.090
I love you.

14:48.112 --> 14:49.142
Ladies.

14:57.400 --> 14:59.650
I'm drinking
to forget my girlfriend.

15:00.695 --> 15:02.261
Come on, it'll be fun.

15:03.111 --> 15:05.741
Oh, my god.
And that British accent.

15:06.339 --> 15:09.351
He was totally laying on the charm.
How could you not be into him?

15:09.451 --> 15:12.285
- Isn't he too old?
- Good old, not gross old.

15:17.938 --> 15:18.771
Popcorn.

15:18.871 --> 15:21.737
Jessi, there is a foreign hottie out
there who seems really into you.

15:21.837 --> 15:22.634
So?

15:22.734 --> 15:25.237
Do something about it.
You're available.

15:26.853 --> 15:27.721
I guess.

15:27.821 --> 15:30.772
You guess? Is there a romantic
interest I'm not aware of?

15:30.999 --> 15:32.021
Only Kyle.

15:35.576 --> 15:37.143
Rewind. Kyle?

15:37.825 --> 15:40.021
- Is that a problem?
- Huge.

15:59.167 --> 16:00.173
Here we go.

16:27.576 --> 16:29.282
I think we should
get Kyle out of here.

16:29.382 --> 16:31.780
- He's fine.
- People are starting to stare.

16:31.880 --> 16:33.825
Now I'm making some serious dime.

16:33.993 --> 16:37.210
OK, do you want
to win your money back?

16:37.310 --> 16:38.845
Nothing or double.

16:38.945 --> 16:40.315
Double or nothing.

16:40.415 --> 16:41.789
That's what I said.

16:42.523 --> 16:46.122
See this glass?
Somebody over there, catch.

16:47.548 --> 16:49.424
Put that glass onto the bar.

16:51.615 --> 16:53.925
I'm going to bounce this quarter

16:54.025 --> 16:56.754
off of this table,
onto the countertop,

16:56.854 --> 16:58.931
off of that neon sign,

16:59.031 --> 17:03.438
off of that hanging light
and skipping it off the handle there.

17:03.606 --> 17:04.939
- Beer tap.
- Beer tap.

17:05.834 --> 17:07.050
Thank you.

17:08.109 --> 17:09.345
And into the glass.

17:09.444 --> 17:11.662
- I'll take that bet.
- You will lose.

17:11.762 --> 17:12.656
Sir.

17:13.665 --> 17:14.755
Just do it.

17:29.856 --> 17:30.730
Pay up.

17:33.427 --> 17:34.688
Thank you, gentlemen.

17:34.788 --> 17:36.729
I've enjoyed bonding with you.

17:38.832 --> 17:39.910
I love you.

17:42.900 --> 17:44.972
How long have you been
into Kyle?

17:45.470 --> 17:48.362
I guess I've always felt
a special connection.

17:48.731 --> 17:50.885
Aren't you guys like,
brother and sister?

17:50.985 --> 17:51.792
No.

17:52.222 --> 17:53.915
But you guys both have the same

17:54.015 --> 17:55.824
you know, no belly button thing.

17:57.178 --> 17:58.993
That doesn't mean we're related.

17:59.285 --> 18:00.998
You sure seem like you are.

18:01.197 --> 18:02.602
No, it's...

18:03.235 --> 18:05.523
more like we're from
the same village.

18:05.729 --> 18:07.712
Is everybody
in a small town related?

18:07.812 --> 18:09.779
In some parts of the country.

18:10.815 --> 18:13.648
Look, I can't help it if I think
Kyle and I are soul mates.

18:13.748 --> 18:15.896
- I just do.
- Soul mates?

18:16.118 --> 18:18.057
Does Kyle know about any of this?

18:18.157 --> 18:20.145
He's never said anything.

18:20.327 --> 18:22.500
But I think he feels the same way.

18:23.087 --> 18:24.757
Or he will eventually.

18:25.092 --> 18:28.499
Jessi, Kyle is totally,
hopelessly in love with Amanda.

18:28.841 --> 18:30.195
But they broke up.

18:30.295 --> 18:32.218
That doesn't mean
he's not still hung up on her.

18:32.318 --> 18:34.978
You saw him. He's been mired
in Wallowtown for days.

18:35.164 --> 18:36.741
Well, when will that end?

18:37.526 --> 18:39.576
There's no exact time.

18:39.939 --> 18:43.246
It could take months, years,
forever to get over someone.

18:45.851 --> 18:48.849
Meanwhile, there's an exciting
international man of mystery

18:48.949 --> 18:51.250
who wants to have coffee
with you at the Rack.

18:53.517 --> 18:55.002
Well, what about you?

18:56.022 --> 18:57.774
What about me?
I'll be fine.

18:58.376 --> 19:00.661
Hot older guys
always have hot older friends.

19:03.241 --> 19:04.379
Watch this.

19:19.492 --> 19:22.494
Do you have one of those
clappers like they sell on TV?

19:23.250 --> 19:25.286
Kyle, you really
shouldn't do that.

19:26.572 --> 19:27.571
Mr. Grumpy.

19:28.065 --> 19:29.459
Please don't do that.

19:30.085 --> 19:31.424
What else can you do?

19:34.010 --> 19:34.817
Well...

19:45.061 --> 19:47.018
Not good.
This is not good.

19:48.335 --> 19:50.007
Where the hell is Declan?

19:52.680 --> 19:54.943
You're like,
a magician or something.

19:55.205 --> 19:57.336
Nope. I was born in a pod.

19:57.636 --> 19:59.453
I'm a science experiment.

20:06.421 --> 20:07.724
You're funny.

20:11.641 --> 20:14.001
- Whoa. You're bald.
- Josh, do you mind?

20:14.101 --> 20:16.503
- We gotta get Kyle out of here.
- Not now.

20:17.807 --> 20:18.650
Hello.

20:19.385 --> 20:20.844
My name is Kyle

20:21.333 --> 20:25.164
and I am the result
of a science experiment.

20:27.472 --> 20:28.518
Hang on.

20:33.381 --> 20:34.903
It's Tom Foss.

20:36.360 --> 20:39.651
- Hello, Foss.
- Kyle, I've been trying to call you.

20:39.751 --> 20:41.878
You've been trying
to call me what?

20:44.125 --> 20:45.457
Are you drunk?

20:48.057 --> 20:49.022
Maybe.

20:49.884 --> 20:52.020
- Yes.
- Kyle, listen to me.

20:52.601 --> 20:53.622
Not now.

20:57.402 --> 20:59.088
I just hung up on Foss.

20:59.540 --> 21:01.018
Anyway, what was I saying?

21:01.118 --> 21:03.928
So, Latnok took an embryo

21:04.325 --> 21:08.141
and put it in a pod with
all these X and Y chromosomes,

21:08.309 --> 21:11.824
which is why
there's no umbilical cord.

21:13.397 --> 21:14.439
Yes!

21:14.717 --> 21:15.899
That is my name!

21:16.067 --> 21:17.942
- Gotta stop, buddy.
- No.

21:20.118 --> 21:21.297
I cannot stop.

21:21.851 --> 21:23.190
Because I'm Kyle.

21:23.698 --> 21:25.491
I'm Kyle XY.

21:29.250 --> 21:30.954
Now can we leave?

21:36.129 --> 21:37.364
This is a disaster.

21:37.464 --> 21:39.317
Everything's gonna be fine.

21:39.417 --> 21:41.814
Bringing Kyle home like this isn't fine.

21:42.686 --> 21:44.184
Kyle, are you OK?

21:45.193 --> 21:47.805
Can't you do something like,
I don't know, alter the polarity

21:47.973 --> 21:50.743
of your liver to process
the alcohol or something?

21:51.300 --> 21:53.028
I can't believe
you did this to him.

21:53.128 --> 21:55.910
Me? You were into this too
until I cut you off.

21:56.370 --> 21:59.323
About that. I think I
have ginger ale poisoning.

22:03.259 --> 22:04.330
No way.

22:07.175 --> 22:09.506
Please tell me
we parked someplace else.

22:10.486 --> 22:15.434
<i>You lifted me
so I could reach the peaks</i>

22:16.259 --> 22:20.838
<i>You made me drink
so I could hardly speak</i>

22:21.855 --> 22:23.506
What can I get for you?

22:23.606 --> 22:25.900
I hear your lattes are exceptional.

22:26.294 --> 22:28.543
I wouldn't go that far,
but they don't disappoint.

22:28.643 --> 22:30.885
I'll have one of them, then.
Nonfat.

22:33.079 --> 22:34.768
Sorry. Have we met?

22:34.995 --> 22:37.174
I don't believe
I've had the pleasure.

22:37.934 --> 22:39.380
One latte, nonfat.

22:46.144 --> 22:48.795
- I'm Lori, by the way.
- Michael Cassidy.

22:49.354 --> 22:51.107
- Here's my friend.
- A friend. 

22:51.207 --> 22:53.467
- I want you to meet him.
- Absolutely.

23:12.912 --> 23:14.179
Thanks for the ride.

23:14.279 --> 23:15.292
<i>No problem.</i>

23:18.498 --> 23:19.522
Thank you.

23:20.893 --> 23:23.457
Man. Now my butt smells
like cabbage.

23:23.557 --> 23:24.903
What else is new?

23:29.043 --> 23:30.278
The window.

23:36.665 --> 23:39.459
Hey, man, our car got towed
in front of the Wild Coyote.

23:39.721 --> 23:41.127
It's my dad's SUV.

23:42.158 --> 23:44.261
Your have daddy's car towed.

23:45.034 --> 23:47.725
You guys might lose your Xbox
for a few days.

23:48.839 --> 23:51.638
I need to see your driver's
license and your registration.

23:51.865 --> 23:53.890
The registration's in the car.

23:54.058 --> 23:56.834
- That's a problem, isn't it?
- Come on, man.

23:58.226 --> 23:59.204
Do you...

23:59.677 --> 24:03.248
understand the absurdity
of the conundrum that you presented?

24:04.093 --> 24:05.207
How is that?

24:05.307 --> 24:07.258
You asked us to show you

24:07.979 --> 24:10.721
our registration to retrieve our car.

24:10.979 --> 24:12.381
But our car

24:12.791 --> 24:14.761
is locked behind a fence

24:15.243 --> 24:17.245
that you won't let us get to.

24:18.233 --> 24:20.374
That is incredibly stupid.

24:21.124 --> 24:22.788
Are you calling me stupid?

24:22.985 --> 24:24.122
No, sir.

24:24.392 --> 24:25.677
Not at all.

24:26.458 --> 24:30.118
Can we just work something out,
or...

24:32.227 --> 24:34.314
Sure. I'll tell you what.

24:34.803 --> 24:38.048
You give me 200 bucks, I'll let you
go back and get your registration.

24:38.325 --> 24:41.593
See, yeah, I don't...
I don't have $200 on me.

24:42.695 --> 24:45.316
Well, you know, I guess
you're gonna have to call Daddy.

24:49.307 --> 24:51.030
You're good boys, aren't you?

24:55.016 --> 24:56.707
What the hell are you doing?

24:57.570 --> 25:00.657
Why would you invite Lori Trager
here if you knew you were meeting me?

25:00.757 --> 25:03.407
I don't see the problem.
Is there a problem?

25:03.507 --> 25:05.083
You told me not to see her.

25:05.183 --> 25:06.660
Change of plans.

25:06.760 --> 25:09.465
- A change of plans?
- I changed my mind.

25:10.048 --> 25:12.195
I thought you'd be happy about it.

25:18.122 --> 25:19.165
Whatever.

25:24.583 --> 25:26.252
- Are you purging?
- Yeah.

25:26.352 --> 25:29.880
I'm just tossing out everything
dated last century.

25:31.463 --> 25:33.783
So you realize
all the kids are out?

25:35.227 --> 25:36.624
Yeah, I wanna finish.

25:37.045 --> 25:38.433
Are you mad at me?

25:39.320 --> 25:40.532
Just busy.

25:43.163 --> 25:44.667
You are mad at me.

25:45.094 --> 25:45.960
Why?

25:48.775 --> 25:50.067
I'm not mad.

25:50.292 --> 25:51.433
It's just...

25:51.641 --> 25:53.634
here I was,
trying to reach out to Jessi,

25:53.802 --> 25:55.553
something I rarely
get a chance to do.

25:55.721 --> 25:58.119
And you barge in here
with the same nonsense

25:58.219 --> 26:00.933
about Lori and her bad attitude
or whatever it is you call it.

26:01.101 --> 26:02.871
- She lied to me.
- I know that.

26:02.971 --> 26:05.605
But there was no good reason
for you to object to her seeing Mark.

26:05.773 --> 26:08.548
- Mark's two years older.
- You're four years older than me.

26:08.648 --> 26:10.518
She's in high school
and he's in college.

26:10.618 --> 26:12.554
He's smart, he's responsible.

26:12.654 --> 26:14.980
The kind of boy
we want her to be with.

26:15.080 --> 26:17.489
But you laid down the law
and she broke it.

26:17.589 --> 26:19.702
- So you got all puffed up.
- Puffed up?

26:20.854 --> 26:22.935
She didn't do what
you wanted her to do,

26:23.035 --> 26:24.738
and your ego took a hit.

26:25.136 --> 26:26.042
Is that all?

26:27.067 --> 26:28.103
That's all.

26:43.456 --> 26:44.714
Almost there.

26:44.969 --> 26:46.520
Why are we doing this again?

26:46.688 --> 26:48.920
To get your registration from the car.

26:54.985 --> 26:56.185
Am I bleeding?

27:01.350 --> 27:02.349
Your turn.

27:14.140 --> 27:16.694
- Show off.
- Just look for the car.

27:19.007 --> 27:21.507
I can't believe we're doing
this. This is all...

27:21.607 --> 27:24.789
My fault. Acknowledged. I was just
trying to make Kyle feel better.

27:24.889 --> 27:27.437
I don't. I feel terrible.

27:27.537 --> 27:30.439
- It'll pass.
- I don't feel better about anything.

27:30.607 --> 27:32.139
Are You gonna start in on me too?

27:32.239 --> 27:34.318
You should have let me call
Amanda when I wanted.

27:34.486 --> 27:37.727
Fine. You know what? Go ahead,
call her. Beg for forgiveness.

27:37.827 --> 27:40.230
You'll probably pull it off,
too, 'cause you're Kyle.

27:40.330 --> 27:43.177
Perfect Kyle. You always know
just what to do.

27:44.692 --> 27:47.129
- What was that about?
- I don't know.

27:47.525 --> 27:48.764
I feel sick.

27:49.585 --> 27:51.043
Don't leave me, buddy. Come on.

27:51.211 --> 27:53.388
I feel really sick.

27:57.014 --> 27:58.013
Holy crap.

27:58.417 --> 27:59.623
What did you do?

28:00.568 --> 28:04.328
I altered the polarity of my liver
to return my body to homeostasis.

28:04.428 --> 28:05.847
That's what I said.

28:10.969 --> 28:13.410
- You stole the car?
- It's your car. Get in.

28:13.510 --> 28:14.810
- Get out!
- What?

28:14.910 --> 28:17.326
You're drunk. I'm not getting in
the car with you. Get in back.

28:18.089 --> 28:20.573
- Stay where you are!
- We're all gonna die.

28:21.200 --> 28:22.532
Get back here!

28:42.850 --> 28:44.546
Great. Just great.

28:44.646 --> 28:46.118
At least I got your car back.

28:46.218 --> 28:48.272
You've been really awesome
tonight. Thank you.

28:48.372 --> 28:50.728
It's just a flat tire.
We can fix it.

28:50.896 --> 28:54.002
Kyle can twitch his nose
or channel his chi or something.

28:54.102 --> 28:57.276
We all know you're the man.
You're the savior. I'm the screw up.

28:57.571 --> 29:00.214
- What are you talking about?
- What am I talking about?

29:00.785 --> 29:02.365
Just... Just fix it.

29:04.967 --> 29:05.785
I will.

29:11.739 --> 29:15.218
What's taking so long, huh?
Come on, work your magic.

29:16.493 --> 29:18.798
- Why are you acting like this?
- You got a problem with it?

29:19.178 --> 29:19.993
Hey, hey, stop.

29:23.535 --> 29:24.474
Come on.

29:27.521 --> 29:31.074
You guys should be looking after
me, not the other way around.

29:31.174 --> 29:33.791
This is crazy.
I'm the sober one.

29:34.001 --> 29:37.148
I'm the designated driver.
I'm refereeing the fight.

29:37.585 --> 29:39.693
And giving girl advice.

29:40.594 --> 29:43.522
When you think about it,
I'm the only one with a

29:43.622 --> 29:45.984
successful, functioning relationship.

29:46.962 --> 29:49.314
What am I doing with
you two losers?

29:49.414 --> 29:51.539
So, what are you doing
with your life now?

29:51.707 --> 29:53.964
Are you going to college
or you working?

29:54.064 --> 29:55.570
I'm not that old.

29:56.425 --> 29:57.920
You are very mature.

30:00.591 --> 30:02.258
I've had to learn quickly.

30:02.358 --> 30:03.300
It shows.

30:04.980 --> 30:07.515
I haven't seen you
around the apartment.

30:07.973 --> 30:09.110
My mother...

30:09.674 --> 30:10.756
she left.

30:11.046 --> 30:12.309
She left me.

30:12.842 --> 30:13.811
I'm sorry.

30:15.403 --> 30:16.770
I'm all right.

30:17.401 --> 30:19.001
It's OK if you're not.

30:21.097 --> 30:22.278
You will be.

30:25.518 --> 30:26.901
- Let me explain.
- What?

30:27.001 --> 30:28.823
How you like jerking girls around?

30:28.923 --> 30:31.623
Because, one minute you're into me,
then suddenly you're not.

30:31.723 --> 30:34.135
We play the whole
"accidental run-in thing."

30:34.235 --> 30:36.411
And then you gave me a kiss,
which from my vantage point

30:36.511 --> 30:37.935
you seemed to like a whole lot.

30:38.035 --> 30:40.680
And then, boom, suddenly
you don't want to defy my father

30:40.780 --> 30:43.609
or jeopardize your future
or some other lame-ass excuse.

30:43.709 --> 30:45.759
- But it's...
- Let me finish.

30:47.162 --> 30:48.524
I thought we had something,

30:48.624 --> 30:50.970
but clearly you don't.
And the least you could have done

30:51.070 --> 30:52.903
was been man enough to be honest.

30:53.003 --> 30:54.004
Excuse me.

31:23.677 --> 31:24.817
Did I do something?

31:26.377 --> 31:27.317
No...

31:28.074 --> 31:29.600
Why are you so angry?

31:30.208 --> 31:32.105
If you ask me,
he's still hung up on Lori.

31:32.205 --> 31:35.940
It's not about Lori or Hillary.
It's not about girls at all.

31:36.486 --> 31:38.771
- You're not, uh...
- It's about my ankle, you idiot!

31:42.128 --> 31:44.440
I went to see a specialist
the other day.

31:44.642 --> 31:46.213
Top foot guy around.

31:46.642 --> 31:48.573
Treats the Seahawks
and the Sonics.

31:49.602 --> 31:52.117
Turns out there's
this little bone.

31:53.038 --> 31:54.491
Talus or something.

31:56.048 --> 31:56.883
Anyway,

31:57.852 --> 32:00.801
mine's been fractured
for like, years, he said.

32:02.218 --> 32:04.347
Maybe if they would
have caught it...

32:06.950 --> 32:07.929
They didn't.

32:10.668 --> 32:12.606
So I've been playing on it.

32:13.730 --> 32:14.848
Never healed right.

32:15.524 --> 32:17.720
What about the surgery
you had before?

32:18.663 --> 32:22.126
It's a different part of the ankle.
Just one of those things.

32:23.271 --> 32:25.951
Diminished function,
I think they call it.

32:29.015 --> 32:30.406
Basketball's history.

32:33.448 --> 32:37.881
I should have cracked a book
once in a while, I guess.

32:44.810 --> 32:47.789
I'll uh, get the spare.

32:50.344 --> 32:52.890
- Are you in pain?
- Some.

32:54.488 --> 32:56.674
Is that why you wanted
to get drunk tonight?

32:56.870 --> 32:57.921
To forget?

32:59.138 --> 33:00.436
Maybe, yeah.

33:05.255 --> 33:08.068
You step up and face your problems,

33:08.236 --> 33:10.183
but me, I run away.

33:11.963 --> 33:14.575
For once I guess
I wanted you to do the same.

33:17.963 --> 33:19.787
When I saw you like that tonight,

33:21.524 --> 33:23.875
it made me feel so bad
about my life.

33:26.710 --> 33:27.813
I understand.

33:30.244 --> 33:33.613
Guys, I don't think
we have a spare.

33:35.250 --> 33:37.181
Your father drives around
without a spare?

33:37.446 --> 33:38.466
Guess so.

33:39.590 --> 33:40.910
Now I've got to call him.

33:42.085 --> 33:43.683
What am I supposed to say?

33:43.783 --> 33:47.106
"Hey, Dad!
You want to come pick us up?

33:47.312 --> 33:49.817
We just did some serious
underage drinking.

33:49.917 --> 33:52.541
And then, after Kyle's
humongous ralph,

33:52.789 --> 33:55.699
we shredded the back tire
breaking out of an impound lot."

34:07.896 --> 34:09.561
Thanks for driving, by the way.

34:13.659 --> 34:15.924
You should have seen this guy
back at the bar.

34:16.416 --> 34:20.139
- He picked up a bald chick.
- You did?

34:21.786 --> 34:24.215
She wasn't bald.
Her head was shaved.

34:24.315 --> 34:25.524
There's a difference.

34:27.179 --> 34:27.981
Cue ball.

34:28.545 --> 34:30.534
I don't really remember that much.

34:31.576 --> 34:32.402
You don't?

34:34.958 --> 34:36.364
Why? Did I do something?

34:37.438 --> 34:38.558
Oh... no...

34:38.938 --> 34:39.958
Nothing, really.

34:43.505 --> 34:46.568
Gentlemen, our luck
is about to change.

35:10.807 --> 35:14.778
Now you are gonna pay for what
you did back there, boy.

35:15.471 --> 35:18.091
I'd like to. Eighty-five dollars
for the impound fee

35:18.191 --> 35:20.397
and whatever
it costs to fix the fence.

35:22.181 --> 35:23.579
I don't want your money.

35:33.009 --> 35:34.236
What the hell are you?

35:38.050 --> 35:40.071
All right. Keep it.

35:40.421 --> 35:41.988
I got something better.

36:07.882 --> 36:09.542
I don't like that she lied.

36:10.170 --> 36:11.460
I don't either.

36:13.078 --> 36:17.262
But I guess my
ego did come into play.

36:17.943 --> 36:22.262
- But I didn't get all puffed up.
- How about slightly inflated?

36:24.623 --> 36:27.601
I'm sorry I interrupted you
and Jessi earlier.

36:28.354 --> 36:30.013
I'll get another chance.

36:33.340 --> 36:35.941
I'll tell Lori
it's OK to see Mark.

36:38.558 --> 36:40.405
I just hope it's not too late.

36:43.994 --> 36:46.568
I knew Jessi was good
for something.

37:03.871 --> 37:06.314
Mother relationships
are a tricky business.

37:06.414 --> 37:07.665
Believe me, I know.

37:08.242 --> 37:09.728
Did yours leave, too?

37:11.486 --> 37:13.548
Maybe I'll tell you
more about it someday

37:13.648 --> 37:15.012
when I know you better.

37:15.367 --> 37:18.007
We're supposed to be closed.
Is there anything else?

37:18.107 --> 37:19.278
Oh. Sorry, love.

37:25.200 --> 37:26.169
Here you go.

37:30.352 --> 37:32.269
She's a bit icy, isn't she?

37:33.083 --> 37:34.501
I kissed her boyfriend.

37:35.620 --> 37:36.537
Oh, really?

37:37.094 --> 37:39.238
We always had
a special connection.

37:41.129 --> 37:43.010
- You and her boyfriend.
- Yeah.

37:44.128 --> 37:46.519
It's hard to explain.
But it's there.

37:47.325 --> 37:49.306
It's like we speak
the same language,

37:49.406 --> 37:50.767
have the same thoughts.

37:51.880 --> 37:53.808
That is a rare thing to find.

37:54.756 --> 37:55.756
Yeah, well...

37:56.024 --> 37:58.880
For some reason he thinks
he's meant to be with Amanda.

37:59.420 --> 38:01.771
Have you told this boy
how you feel?

38:04.225 --> 38:05.513
It's complicated.

38:06.132 --> 38:08.255
I'm living in the same house now.

38:10.995 --> 38:12.520
Listen, Jessi,

38:12.620 --> 38:14.958
you are a very special young lady.

38:16.005 --> 38:17.376
You're brilliant,

38:18.213 --> 38:20.422
beautiful, unique,

38:21.978 --> 38:24.978
From what I've seen, that
Amanda girl has nothing on you.

38:25.078 --> 38:28.639
And if you really do sense that
special bond between you and Kyle,

38:28.807 --> 38:30.401
you should act on it.

38:30.958 --> 38:32.728
How did you know his name?

38:33.460 --> 38:34.895
I never mentioned it.

38:37.913 --> 38:41.599
There's a lot of things
I know about you, Jessi.

38:43.152 --> 38:44.802
A lot more than you think.

38:45.659 --> 38:47.855
And many that you don't know
about me.

38:49.040 --> 38:50.160
I don't understand.

38:51.545 --> 38:53.185
I think it's time I explained.

38:56.459 --> 38:58.584
Man, I feel like I've been hit
by a truck.

38:58.780 --> 39:01.151
Me, too and I didn't even drink.

39:05.110 --> 39:06.945
Is Amanda's light still on?

39:10.818 --> 39:11.974
I can't help it.

39:12.142 --> 39:13.942
You could always get drunk
every night.

39:14.828 --> 39:17.938
I don't ever want to get drunk
like that again.

39:18.716 --> 39:20.899
I don't want to forget
how much I care about Amanda

39:21.067 --> 39:23.017
and why she's so important to me.

39:23.757 --> 39:25.988
So, you happy being miserable?

39:27.751 --> 39:29.390
I'm gonna have to work through it.

39:29.490 --> 39:32.369
Nothing I can do or say
is gonna help her understand.

39:33.540 --> 39:34.922
Except the truth.

39:36.287 --> 39:37.166
What?

39:37.352 --> 39:38.375
Josh is right.

39:38.898 --> 39:40.476
Why not tell her everything?

39:40.678 --> 39:42.170
- I can't.
- Why not?

39:42.573 --> 39:44.786
- You told us the truth.
- It's not the same.

39:44.886 --> 39:47.308
- Kyle!
- It's totally the same.

39:47.408 --> 39:49.738
- Bro, I don't understand.
- Go for it, man.

39:49.838 --> 39:50.985
I can't!

39:54.549 --> 39:55.775
It's not the same.

39:56.806 --> 39:59.487
Amanda loves me
and if I tell her everything...

40:02.817 --> 40:04.683
I don't want her
to stop loving me.

40:10.683 --> 40:12.214
You've already lost her.

40:13.420 --> 40:15.461
You've got nothing to lose.

40:17.428 --> 40:20.399
You know, I rarely agree
with this guy here,

40:20.872 --> 40:22.258
but he's right, Kyle.

40:25.222 --> 40:28.925
Nothing to lose
and everything to gain.

40:31.781 --> 40:32.956
Seems too easy.

40:33.935 --> 40:35.863
Sometimes the best solutions are.

40:43.095 --> 40:44.343
I'm gonna tell her.

40:45.456 --> 40:47.611
Dude, you made a breakthrough.

40:48.302 --> 40:50.614
Go now.
Before you lose your nerve.

40:57.523 --> 40:58.622
I love you guys.

41:01.414 --> 41:04.609
<i>After a night of mistakes
and valuable lessons learned,</i>

41:04.709 --> 41:06.826
<i>I finally understood male bonding.</i>

41:07.197 --> 41:09.331
<i>It's not using your friends
to forget.</i>

41:09.717 --> 41:12.048
<i>It's remembering how lucky
you are to have them.</i>

41:12.952 --> 41:14.275
All right, go.

41:17.398 --> 41:18.213
So.

41:19.400 --> 41:20.988
You can give me a lift home.

41:23.954 --> 41:24.871
Let's go.

41:34.852 --> 41:36.868
- Foss, I can't talk right now.
- Kyle!

41:39.468 --> 41:42.036
- I've been trying to reach you.
- I was with my friends.

41:42.136 --> 41:43.789
Yeah. Getting drunk!

41:44.779 --> 41:46.552
When I call you it's important.

41:47.601 --> 41:49.360
- I'm sorry.
- You answer the phone

41:49.460 --> 41:51.078
- and you stay on it!
- Hey!

41:51.460 --> 41:53.268
I needed you and you were gone.

41:53.612 --> 41:55.880
- There's been a lot going on.
- Listen to me.

41:57.426 --> 41:58.854
- Adam Baylin...
- What?

42:00.102 --> 42:03.535
- What about him?
- He's been deteriorating.

42:04.957 --> 42:07.545
And I've been moving him
from location to location.

42:08.133 --> 42:10.307
- Staying on the run.
- Why?

42:10.885 --> 42:12.070
What's been going on?

42:17.905 --> 42:19.744
- He wanted to see you, Kyle.
- Tell me!

42:23.556 --> 42:24.666
Adam died today.

42:29.726 --> 42:30.865
He died?

42:32.803 --> 42:35.343
You may not realize it yet,
but this changes everything.
