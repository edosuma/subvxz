00:01.660 --> 00:03.059
MARILYN:
It's my music system
for the baby.

00:03.100 --> 00:05.591
VERONICA:
How clever.

00:05.630 --> 00:06.665
How many
months?

00:06.700 --> 00:07.735
Three and a half.

00:07.770 --> 00:09.499
Oh, and do you
know the sex yet?

00:09.540 --> 00:10.529
I do, it's a boy.

00:10.570 --> 00:12.606
Oh, how
sweet, a boy.

00:12.640 --> 00:14.608
I love
boys.

00:14.640 --> 00:16.141
Do you have
a name yet?

00:16.180 --> 00:17.306
I do.

00:17.350 --> 00:18.374
Peter.

00:21.320 --> 00:23.117
(coughs)

00:23.150 --> 00:24.742
Are you all right?

00:24.790 --> 00:26.348
You're naming the baby Peter?

00:26.390 --> 00:28.312
Yes. Why?

00:28.360 --> 00:30.180
Can I have a word with you?

00:30.230 --> 00:31.652
It's not what you think.
Oh, and what do I think?

00:31.690 --> 00:33.396
No, no. Wait, wait.

00:34.460 --> 00:36.394
Ooh.
Are you Insane?

00:36.430 --> 00:38.261
It has nothing to do
with the governor.

00:38.300 --> 00:39.597
His name is Peter and you're
naming your baby Peter,

00:39.640 --> 00:41.232
and that has nothing to do
with the governor?

00:41.270 --> 00:42.237
It's a coincidence.

00:42.270 --> 00:43.532
No, a coincidence is when
you bump into someone

00:43.570 --> 00:44.559
on a subway platform,

00:44.610 --> 00:46.407
not that you name
your child after them.

00:46.440 --> 00:48.328
I'm naming my baby
after the... father.

00:48.380 --> 00:50.200
Oh, dear holy God.

00:50.250 --> 00:51.444
It's not the
governor.

00:51.480 --> 00:52.674
Who is the father?

00:52.720 --> 00:54.676
I can't say.

00:57.450 --> 00:58.439
He's a private person.

00:58.490 --> 01:01.414
He doesn't want to draw
attention to himself.

01:01.460 --> 01:03.325
Oh, well, at least he
doesn't want to do that.

01:03.360 --> 01:05.328
Eli, Marilyn, hi.

01:05.360 --> 01:07.225
Hi, Alicia.
Why aren't you in the party?

01:07.260 --> 01:09.490
Why aren't we in the party?
I have no idea.
Oh, okay.

01:09.530 --> 01:10.622
Um, have you
seen the band?

01:10.670 --> 01:14.333
No, no, just the two of us
having a nice little chat.

01:14.370 --> 01:17.100
Okay.

01:17.140 --> 01:18.368
MAN:
This is cool,

01:18.410 --> 01:19.377
it's-it's, uh,
it's a cool group.

01:19.410 --> 01:20.308
People danced.

01:20.340 --> 01:22.342
Well, it was your music.
It was infectious.

01:22.380 --> 01:23.608
Who do I give
the check to?

01:23.650 --> 01:25.675
Uh, Marshall.
He's the business mind.

01:25.710 --> 01:27.439
Thank you very much
for everything, and if there's

01:27.480 --> 01:29.141
anything
we can do...
Um, actually,

01:29.190 --> 01:30.145
_ th-ther_e
IS something.

01:30.190 --> 01:32.784
Um, we were really stoked
to book this gig,

01:32.820 --> 01:35.311
'cause... Well, you guys
are lawyers, right?

01:35.360 --> 01:37.328
Yes.
Cool,

01:37.360 --> 01:39.851
and you take on cases?
Like, anyone's cases?

01:41.730 --> 01:43.698
Well, um, sometimes.
Why?

01:43.730 --> 01:45.266
Well, uh...

01:45.300 --> 01:47.393
Hey. (laughs)
How you domg?

01:49.670 --> 01:51.228
Um...

01:51.270 --> 01:53.238
We'd like to show
you something.

01:53.280 --> 01:54.872
* But she ain't nothing
but a tricky trick *

01:54.910 --> 01:56.798
* Thicky thick

It's "Thicky Trick" by,
you know, the, um, it's...

02:07.460 --> 02:08.882
Rebel Kane.

02:09.930 --> 02:12.455
He was in prison
with my husband.

02:12.500 --> 02:13.626
Oh, yeah?

02:13.660 --> 02:16.299
Oh, that's...
didn't expect that.

02:16.330 --> 02:17.319
So are you suing them?

02:19.940 --> 02:21.828
* Never satisfied,
said he's gonna give me more *

02:21.870 --> 02:23.633
* Hair shop, don't be late...

02:23.670 --> 02:26.332

02:26.380 --> 02:28.871

02:34.320 --> 02:36.208

02:36.250 --> 02:37.512
That's us, our song.

02:37.550 --> 02:38.847
CARY:
So, you covered
Rebel Kane's song

02:38.890 --> 02:40.619
but you didn't
get the rights for it.
No,

02:40.660 --> 02:42.525
We got the rights.
We got the...

02:42.560 --> 02:43.527
What'd we get, Marshall?

02:43.560 --> 02:44.754
Compulsory license.

02:44.790 --> 02:45.950
Yeah. Murray got 'em.

02:45.990 --> 02:47.321
He's our manager.

02:47.360 --> 02:49.362
Uh, okay,
so what's the problem?

02:49.400 --> 02:51.527
Ah. Al-Almost there.

02:51.570 --> 02:54.539
* Tryin' to get a taste
of that brown and brown *

02:54.570 --> 02:56.800
* Uh-uh, she ain't havin' that

02:56.840 --> 02:59.604
* Raised in the hood,
ghetto fabulous *

02:59.640 --> 03:01.870
* She kinda look bad, boy,
I must admit *

03:01.910 --> 03:04.242
* But she ain't nothing
but a thicky trick *

03:04.280 --> 03:05.838
* That little mama...

03:05.880 --> 03:06.972
What's that?

03:07.020 --> 03:09.284
That is Drama Camp.

03:09.320 --> 03:12.585
It's a television show about
a summer camp talent show.

03:12.620 --> 03:15.555
There's a TV show about
a summer camp talent show?

03:15.590 --> 03:16.579
Yeah, and it's a hit.

03:16.630 --> 03:18.621
* Triclq trick...

03:18.660 --> 03:19.729
But that's our song.

03:19.760 --> 03:21.455
They're playing our song.
No,

03:21.500 --> 03:22.797
they're singing
Rebel Kane's song.

03:22.830 --> 03:25.219
His lyrics, but they're
covering, like...

03:25.270 --> 03:26.237
like we covered it.

03:26.270 --> 03:27.635
Like, that's our melody,

03:27.670 --> 03:28.739
and they stole it.

03:28.770 --> 03:31.933
We were gonna let the whole
thing slide, and then...

03:31.970 --> 03:33.574
I... I don't know.

03:33.610 --> 03:35.601
Wsumm

03:35.640 --> 03:36.948
What they're doing,
it's not right.

03:36.980 --> 03:38.447
And then you
guys called us.

03:38.480 --> 03:39.913
Hiring lawyers costs
a lot of money, guys.

03:39.950 --> 03:42.009
And this is really
a David and Goliath situation,

03:42.050 --> 03:43.449
going up against
a TV network.

03:43.490 --> 03:45.981
Well, that's why we were
hoping you'd go on...

03:46.020 --> 03:46.987
Oh, what's it called?

03:47.020 --> 03:48.248
A percentage.

03:48.290 --> 03:50.019
Contingency. Well...

03:50.060 --> 03:51.755
You know,

03:51.790 --> 03:53.553
if there's a lot of money
at stake, sometimes we...

03:53.600 --> 03:55.420
$2.3 million.

03:57.300 --> 03:58.460
The Drama Camp
version's

03:58.500 --> 04:01.469
the best-selling song on iTunes
for the last eight weeks.

04:01.500 --> 04:04.628
* Steady screamin',
"Give me money, money..." *

04:04.670 --> 04:05.739
(elevator dings)

04:05.770 --> 04:08.978
Alicia Florrick,
please. Burl Preston.

04:09.010 --> 04:10.739
Yes.

04:10.780 --> 04:12.919
Uh, do you mind my asking:
are you one of her clients?

04:12.950 --> 04:14.941
I do mind.
I'll answer anyway.

04:14.980 --> 04:16.880
I am not
one of her clients.

04:16.920 --> 04:19.241
I am being sued
by her yet again.

04:24.390 --> 04:25.687
(indistinct argument)

04:25.730 --> 04:29.496
WILL:
That's not what
I was saying, no.

04:29.530 --> 04:32.294
No, the problem is, you
didn't consult with any of us.

04:32.340 --> 04:34.296
I was in a bar.
I consulted with Damian.

04:34.340 --> 04:36.365
You don't plan
our future in bars.

04:36.410 --> 04:37.763
It's Los Angeles, Diane.
It's a good market for us.

04:37.810 --> 04:40.904
We just opened in New
York. Can we please just
do one thing at a time?

04:40.940 --> 04:43.500
We are doing one thing
at a time: expanding.

04:43.550 --> 04:45.939
Do you want to
discuss this like adults?

04:45.980 --> 04:47.743
You agreed. We weren't
going to slow down

04:47.780 --> 04:50.578
for anyone, anything. This
is a good opportunity for us.

04:50.620 --> 04:53.316
A client in LA.
We don't have an
infrastructure in LA.

04:53.360 --> 04:54.782
So we build one.
Let's vote.

04:54.820 --> 04:56.720
Howard. Wake up,
we're voting.
I move that we institute

04:56.760 --> 04:59.888
a two-month ban on
sollcmng new clients.
No, no, that's not the...

04:59.930 --> 05:00.954
I second.
DIANE: We have a second.

05:01.000 --> 05:03.093
WILL: The vote is_about
opening an office In LA,

05:03.130 --> 05:05.064
it's not ab...
The motion has
already been seconded.

05:05.100 --> 05:06.988
I am calling the question.
All those in favor

05:07.040 --> 05:09.531
of a two-month delay on
soliciting new clients?

05:09.570 --> 05:10.559
No, Howard.

05:10.610 --> 05:11.736
I thought I was voting.

05:11.770 --> 05:13.078
No, this is
a different vote.

05:13.110 --> 05:15.408
DIANE:
All right, 12 yeses.
All those against?

05:16.610 --> 05:17.804
Howard.

05:17.850 --> 05:18.942
Ugh.

05:20.880 --> 05:22.381
Ten noes,
the motion passes.

05:22.420 --> 05:24.388
We have a 60-day moratorium

05:24.420 --> 05:26.047
on soliciting new clients.

05:26.090 --> 05:28.354
There's someone asking
for Alicia Florrick.

05:28.390 --> 05:29.357
VVho?

05:29.390 --> 05:31.358
Burl Preston.

05:32.660 --> 05:33.820
Well, that's a surprise.

05:33.860 --> 05:34.827
Yes.

05:34.860 --> 05:36.020
She started her own firm.

05:36.060 --> 05:38.119
She seems to be holding
all the old grudges.

05:38.170 --> 05:39.125
Well,

05:39.170 --> 05:40.990
don't blame me for that.
Oh,

05:41.040 --> 05:42.462
it's too bad.

05:42.510 --> 05:44.899
I was looking forward
to facing you in court.

05:46.110 --> 05:47.930
How's L.A. treating you,
Mr. Preston?

05:47.980 --> 05:50.448
85 degrees when I left.

05:50.480 --> 05:52.675
32 degrees here.

05:52.720 --> 05:53.948
You tell me.

05:53.980 --> 05:55.948
I was thinking
of signing clients in LA.

05:55.980 --> 05:57.516
Yeah, great.

05:59.190 --> 06:00.885
What's the case?

06:00.920 --> 06:03.559
The suit Alicia's bringing?

06:03.590 --> 06:06.957
It's, uh, copyright
infringement. Why?

06:07.000 --> 06:10.060
I know how she works.
I know her weaknesses.

06:10.100 --> 06:11.419
I know how to beat her.

06:12.600 --> 06:13.737
You're offering your services?

06:16.470 --> 06:17.732
No, thank you, though.

06:17.770 --> 06:18.964
Why not?

06:19.010 --> 06:20.568
I don't like you.

06:20.610 --> 06:22.976
I don't like you, either.
What's that got to do with it?

06:24.550 --> 06:27.018
The enemy of my enemy
is my friend.

06:27.050 --> 06:29.780
(phone rings)
WOMAN:
Governor Florrick's office.

06:29.820 --> 06:31.447
Yes, I'll transfer you now.

06:31.490 --> 06:33.981
Kalinda Sharma, there you are.
How you doing?

06:34.020 --> 06:35.510
Good. What
do you need?

06:35.560 --> 06:37.778
A proper hello.

06:37.830 --> 06:38.819
Hello.

06:38.860 --> 06:41.055
Hello. What do you need?

06:41.100 --> 06:44.092
ELI:
Marilyn Garbanza. She's head
of Peter's ethics commission.

06:44.130 --> 06:45.461
She's also pregnant.

06:45.500 --> 06:47.036
Very pregnant.

06:47.070 --> 06:49.607
I need to find out
who the father is.

06:49.640 --> 06:52.438
All I know is that the
father's first name is Peter.

06:53.480 --> 06:54.504
No.

06:54.540 --> 06:56.098
Why not?

06:56.140 --> 06:57.539
This is for Peter.
Florrick.

06:57.580 --> 06:59.616
No, technically, no.

06:59.650 --> 07:01.777
Well, who's it for,
then, technically?

07:01.820 --> 07:03.185
Alicia Florrick.

07:03.220 --> 07:05.609
I need an investigator
who won't leak.

07:05.650 --> 07:07.880
Who won't hurt Alicia.

07:07.920 --> 07:09.456
With?

07:09.490 --> 07:11.981
(whispering):
The possibility that Peter

07:12.030 --> 07:13.725
is the father.

07:13.760 --> 07:15.193
It's a slim possibility,
but even the question

07:15.230 --> 07:18.461
can... cause problems.

07:18.500 --> 07:21.060
I need an outsider...

07:21.100 --> 07:23.136
who won't leak.

07:23.170 --> 07:25.866
$500 an hour.

07:25.910 --> 07:28.970
MAN:
You sure I can't get you
anything? A milkshake?

07:29.010 --> 07:30.238
No, thank you.

07:30.280 --> 07:32.145
Um, we were getting our
paperwork in line

07:32.180 --> 07:33.909
for the lawsuit,
Mr. Mills, and

07:33.950 --> 07:36.248
as their manager, we see you
purchased a compulsory license

07:36.280 --> 07:37.884
from Rebel Kane,
but for some reason

07:37.920 --> 07:39.956
not a derivative copyright.

07:41.120 --> 07:42.485
A, uh, what?

07:42.530 --> 07:43.758
ALICIA:
A derivative copyright.

07:43.790 --> 07:46.657
The compulsory rights
allow you to cover the song.

07:46.700 --> 07:48.952
But the derivative
rights protect you

07:49.000 --> 07:51.218
if you make changes
in that song.

07:51.270 --> 07:52.931
Oh, I have to get two things?

07:52.970 --> 07:54.835
(chuckles)

07:54.870 --> 07:57.668
I hate it when they look
at each other like that.
You don't

07:57.710 --> 08:00.099
have to get them, but we
need the derivative rights

08:00.140 --> 08:02.108
to sue _this TV show
for stealing your cover.

08:02.140 --> 08:03.698
MILLS:
Look, I was
saving money,

08:03.750 --> 08:05.206
I only bought
the rights I needed to.

08:05.250 --> 08:06.808
Do you know how much we make

08:06.850 --> 08:10.638
every time that
someone clicks_ that
song on Spotlfy?

08:10.690 --> 08:13.056
0.004 cents.

08:13.090 --> 08:15.285
Well, let's just get
the derivative rights.

08:15.320 --> 08:16.719
How hard can that be?

08:16.760 --> 08:19.081
Well, you do know Rebel Kane.

08:19.130 --> 08:21.598
REBE_L KANE:
* That little_ mama
thlclq thick *

08:21.630 --> 08:23.518
* But she ain't nothing
but a tricky trick *

08:23.570 --> 08:26.994
* That little mama
thiclq thick... *

08:27.040 --> 08:28.291
Yeah, I don't really
know what happened.

08:28.340 --> 08:30.160
We just, um,
we need a...

08:30.210 --> 08:31.268
denvaﬁve”.

08:31.310 --> 08:32.106
copyright.

08:32.140 --> 08:33.300
(chuckles):
Our manager kind of had

08:33.340 --> 08:34.898
a little bit
of a brain fart,

08:34.940 --> 08:37.579
you know?
So you need a what,
a copyright?

08:37.610 --> 08:39.009
A derivative copyright.

08:39.050 --> 08:40.870
I think you'll
remember my husband?

08:40.920 --> 08:42.239
Yeah.

08:42.280 --> 08:43.281
Peter.

08:43.320 --> 08:45.208
I voted for him.
I mean...

08:45.250 --> 08:46.888
I almost
voted for him.

08:46.920 --> 08:49.753
Well, we wanted to go
straight to you, Mr. Kane.

08:49.790 --> 08:51.724
Instead of through your label.
KANE: I get it.

08:51.760 --> 08:53.557
I was a struggling artist, too.

08:53.600 --> 08:55.795
So how much is a
derivative copyright?

08:55.830 --> 08:57.718
$5,000,
typically.

08:57.770 --> 08:59.226
Look, you name your
next song after me,

08:59.270 --> 09:00.339
I'll give it to
you for free.

09:00.370 --> 09:02.292
ALICIA:
Actually, uh,

09:02.340 --> 09:04.160
money has to change hands.

09:04.210 --> 09:05.768
Even if it's only five dollars.

09:05.810 --> 09:08.233
Okay. Five
dollars.

09:08.280 --> 09:10.976
Come on, all these
plants ain't going
to pay for themselves.

09:11.010 --> 09:12.204
ALICIA:
Great, so I will
have the paperwork

09:12.250 --> 09:13.217
_sent over
this afternoon.

09:13.250 --> 09:14.217
KANE:
Yeah, good.

09:14.250 --> 09:15.217
Oh, here.
(giggles)

09:15.250 --> 09:16.239
We got it.

09:23.360 --> 09:25.624
You're kidding.
This is them?

09:25.660 --> 09:28.322
Hey, we all
started out this way.

09:28.360 --> 09:29.349
I didn't.

09:29.400 --> 09:31.618
They want to settle, right?

09:31.670 --> 09:33.194
Oh, yeah. Too much
of an embarrassment

09:33.240 --> 09:34.593
to go to court.
BURL:
Hello?

09:34.640 --> 09:36.733
Here he is.

09:36.770 --> 09:38.135
Mr. Preston, hello.

09:39.780 --> 09:41.600
You ready...

09:42.650 --> 09:44.845
I believe you
know Mr. Gardner.

09:44.880 --> 09:46.973
Alicia, Cary.
How are you?

09:47.020 --> 09:48.976
Good.

09:49.020 --> 09:52.239
Mr. Gardner and I
have decided to pursue
this case together.

09:52.290 --> 09:54.315
Shall we?
This way.

09:56.660 --> 09:57.354
You should get over it.

09:57.390 --> 09:58.379
Get over what?

09:58.430 --> 09:59.727
Me.

09:59.760 --> 10:01.751
You have an odd
view of me, Alicia.

10:01.800 --> 10:03.267
It's just coincidence

10:03.300 --> 10:05.268
that we keep opposing
each other on cases?

10:05.300 --> 10:06.369
Yes. Burl came to me,

10:06.400 --> 10:08.391
thinking you were still
working at Lockhart/Gardner,

10:08.440 --> 10:10.362
and Ijust...

10:10.410 --> 10:12.162
Given that Drama Camp
stole our client's song...

10:12.210 --> 10:14.132
Your client's song?

10:20.720 --> 10:22.210
...our client's cover

10:22.250 --> 10:24.241
of the Rebel Kane song,
we are suggesting

10:24.290 --> 10:26.758
50% of the network's profits.

10:26.790 --> 10:30.351
$1.2 million up to this point,
and 50% moving forward.

10:31.790 --> 10:33.326
No.

10:35.130 --> 10:36.927
Okay, what's your offer?

10:36.970 --> 10:38.665
$800,000.

10:38.700 --> 10:39.667
With punitive.

10:39.700 --> 10:42.260
You're... offering us $800,000?

10:42.300 --> 10:45.201
No, we're suing you
for $800,000.

10:46.780 --> 10:48.736
You're suing us?

10:48.780 --> 10:50.702
How does that work?

10:50.750 --> 10:53.048
You stole our client's cover
of "Thiclq Trick."

10:53.080 --> 10:55.310
Wait. Are you saying that I'm...
ALICIA:
Rowby.

10:55.350 --> 10:56.681
It's a negotiating point.

10:56.720 --> 10:57.641
No, it's not,
actually.

10:57.690 --> 10:59.715
This is a derivative
copyright from Rebel Kane

10:59.760 --> 11:01.751
granted exclusively
to Tiller Television.

11:01.790 --> 11:03.451
You'll be getting
your five dollars back.

11:03.490 --> 11:05.685
No.
BURL:
Our client owns

11:05.730 --> 11:07.288
the rights to this song,
and we ask that

11:07.330 --> 11:08.854
you pay before
playing it.

11:08.900 --> 11:10.424
And please take down
the online video

11:10.470 --> 11:12.392
of your client
playing our song.

11:12.430 --> 11:14.091
No.

11:14.140 --> 11:15.698
We'll see you in court.

11:15.740 --> 11:17.002
Uh...

11:17.040 --> 11:20.134
Alicia, we can't
make money on this.

11:20.180 --> 11:21.772
Yes, we can.

11:21.810 --> 11:23.778
Have you rethought
your position?

11:23.810 --> 11:26.005
Yes. We'll see you in court.

11:38.160 --> 11:39.354
Alicia will play it
as David and Goliath

11:39.390 --> 11:43.429
because that's what she knows,
that's what serves her ego.

11:43.470 --> 11:45.461
No. Judge Marx
doesn't care.

11:45.500 --> 11:47.434
He's a good judge.

11:47.470 --> 11:48.789
(sighs)
Right.

11:48.840 --> 11:50.330
I'll see you there.

11:51.410 --> 11:53.275
You still need two votes.

11:53.310 --> 11:57.098
Or one vote and one abstention.

11:57.150 --> 11:58.970
Yeah. I can
get you that.

11:59.010 --> 12:01.376
(sniffles)

12:01.420 --> 12:03.285
Tell me about Kalinda.

12:03.320 --> 12:05.481
She's good.
She's a straighter shooter. Why?

12:05.520 --> 12:07.215
She's following me.

12:07.260 --> 12:08.352
Diane put her on it.

12:08.390 --> 12:10.756
She thinks
you're not to be trusted.

12:10.790 --> 12:13.099
Hmm.

12:13.130 --> 12:15.519
We'll need to talk
if she finds something.

12:15.560 --> 12:17.391
Why don't we talk now?

12:17.430 --> 12:21.366
Nah. If she finds something.

12:21.400 --> 12:24.437
No, the question, Your Honor,
is one of theft.

12:24.470 --> 12:26.301
All derivative...
There was no theft here.

12:26.340 --> 12:28.535
Again, Mrs. Florrick
is trying to...
CARY:
If there was no theft,

12:28.580 --> 12:30.901
then why is the plaintiff
trying to change the subject?

12:30.950 --> 12:32.144
It's not changing the subject

12:32.180 --> 12:33.408
_to insist _
on a derivative copyright.

12:33.450 --> 12:35.918
Can I get a new chair?
Mine squeaks.

12:35.950 --> 12:38.544
Another chair for Mr. Canton.

12:38.590 --> 12:42.151
You're asking for a declaratory
judgment of non-infringement?

12:42.190 --> 12:44.454
Yes. Your Honor, our client
may not have the massive

12:44.490 --> 12:46.128
resources their
large TV network has,

12:46.160 --> 12:48.549
but his song was
written 13 months...

12:48.600 --> 12:52.195
Again, that is simply
not true, Your Honor.

12:52.230 --> 12:54.539
And it's unfortunate
that Mrs. Florrick

12:54.570 --> 12:56.435
has to rely on emotion
rather than logic.

12:56.470 --> 12:58.506
What emotion was I...?

12:58.540 --> 13:02.203
Okay, a little less emotion
from everyone, please!

13:02.240 --> 13:04.572
You may call your first witness,
Mrs. Florrick.

13:04.610 --> 13:07.477
* Oh, my gosh, there she go

13:07.520 --> 13:10.239
* Watch all that
when she hit the floor *

13:10.290 --> 13:12.986
* Little mama got back
with her head full of tracks *

13:13.020 --> 13:15.488
* Claimin' other people kids
on her income tax *

13:15.520 --> 13:20.856
* Club hoppin', booty poppin',
drama makin', pocket breakin' *

13:20.900 --> 13:22.527
* Better be paid...

13:22.560 --> 13:23.891
You wrote this
song, Mr. Canton?

13:23.930 --> 13:25.227
Objection,
Your Honor. Vague.

13:25.270 --> 13:26.567
How is it
being vague?

13:26.600 --> 13:28.431
Are you asking
if he wrote the lyrics

13:28.470 --> 13:30.358
or the arrangement
or the flute part or...?

13:30.410 --> 13:32.059
We get it, Mr. Gardner. Sit.

13:32.110 --> 13:34.169
Your objection
is sustained.

13:34.210 --> 13:35.177
Just be

13:35.210 --> 13:36.507
more clear,
Mrs. Florrick.

13:36.540 --> 13:38.599
Rowby, when you say
you wrote this song,

13:38.650 --> 13:40.242
you mean the
melody, correct?

13:40.280 --> 13:41.474
Leading, Your Honor.

13:41.520 --> 13:43.010
You're the one
who wanted clarity.

13:43.050 --> 13:44.210
From him, not you.

13:44.250 --> 13:45.478
That's an odd
objection, Mr. Gardner,

13:45.520 --> 13:47.249
but accurate.
I'll sustain.

13:47.290 --> 13:48.450
What are you doing?

13:48.490 --> 13:49.559
Breaking up her rhythm.

13:49.590 --> 13:51.182
She hates it more
than anything.

13:51.230 --> 13:52.857
ALICIA:
Rowby, who wrote the original

13:52.900 --> 13:55.619
song, um, the rap song?

13:55.660 --> 13:58.060
Rebel Kane.

13:58.100 --> 14:00.432
And who wrote the
tune in this video?

14:00.470 --> 14:03.598
I did, and the arrangements,
and there's no flute.

14:03.640 --> 14:04.504
Good.

14:04.540 --> 14:06.599
Thank you.

14:06.640 --> 14:08.471
I'm
, u
m

14:08.510 --> 14:10.944
Now, Rowby.

14:10.980 --> 14:12.299
Yeah.

14:12.350 --> 14:14.614
How did it come to you...

14:14.650 --> 14:16.641
to cover a rap song this way?

14:16.680 --> 14:18.284
Objection, Your Honor.
Calls for narrative.

14:18.320 --> 14:22.086
Your Honor, counsel is clearly
making trivial objections

14:22.120 --> 14:23.883
in order to throw
me off my pace.

14:23.930 --> 14:25.420
Yes, Mr. Gardner. Stop it!

14:25.460 --> 14:26.427
You may answer
the question.

14:26.460 --> 14:29.054
I don't remember the question.
I don't either.

14:29.100 --> 14:30.897
Which is exactly
Mr. Gardner's intention,

14:30.930 --> 14:33.262
Your Honor.
When do you stop?

14:33.300 --> 14:34.267
Now, Rowby,

14:34.300 --> 14:37.269
what...?

14:39.310 --> 14:41.278
Where were you when...?
CARY:
How did it

14:41.310 --> 14:43.369
come to you to cover a rap song
in the way that you did?

14:43.410 --> 14:44.570
Objection, Your Honor.
Which counsel is questioning?

14:44.610 --> 14:46.043
Sustained.

14:46.080 --> 14:47.217
Can I answer that question
anyway?

14:47.250 --> 14:47.978
ALICIA:
Sure.

14:48.020 --> 14:49.078
Please.

14:49.120 --> 14:50.212
It was August, 8, 2012.

14:50.250 --> 14:51.285
It's the year anniversary

14:51.320 --> 14:53.311
of my dad's death,
and I thought

14:53.360 --> 14:56.682
of thi-this image of Rick Astley
doing a rap, and...

14:56.720 --> 14:59.325
(laughs) ...and I thought
it was... was funny.

15:01.660 --> 15:03.321
You know what he's doing?

15:03.370 --> 15:05.429
Itold him _
about my first time in court,

15:05.470 --> 15:07.438
how all the objections
threw me.

15:07.470 --> 15:08.391
Yeah, he's using it.

15:08.440 --> 15:09.998
You know how cold that is?

15:10.040 --> 15:12.304
Alicia... he's
trying to play you.

15:12.340 --> 15:15.377
You're doing what he wants.
You're being played.

15:15.410 --> 15:18.379
He wants you to think how low
it is of him, so don't!

15:19.410 --> 15:21.412
You're right.

15:23.290 --> 15:24.939
Where are you going?

15:24.990 --> 15:26.287
To change.

15:26.320 --> 15:27.389
* She a drama queen

15:27.420 --> 15:30.355
* Got the cops knockin'
at the door *

15:30.390 --> 15:32.722
* Hair shop, don't be late

15:32.760 --> 15:34.125
* Waiting...

15:34.160 --> 15:36.048
And the cover of this song,
"Thicky Trick"--

15:36.100 --> 15:37.226
it was your inspiration?

15:37.270 --> 15:38.294
Yes.

15:38.330 --> 15:39.729
You created the show
Drama Camp,

15:39.770 --> 15:41.499
so this scene
mattered to you?

15:41.540 --> 15:42.598
Very much.

15:42.640 --> 15:45.336
Like many young men trying
to find their identity,

15:45.370 --> 15:48.476
I was bullied as a kid, so
I wanted to create a show

15:48.510 --> 15:50.239
that had kids moving
beyond the hate.

15:50.280 --> 15:51.406
And you...

15:51.450 --> 15:54.419
I-I mean...

15:54.450 --> 15:59.012
That's why you
covered, uh...

15:59.050 --> 16:00.756
"Thicky Trick" thi-this way?

16:00.790 --> 16:02.451
Mm-hmm, yes.

16:02.490 --> 16:05.482
I wanted to show how
two cultures needed each other.

16:05.530 --> 16:06.519
"Thicky Trick"
was a rap song

16:06.560 --> 16:09.552
given a white-bread
treatment by the white kids,

16:09.600 --> 16:12.319
and then we had
the African-American kids

16:12.370 --> 16:13.997
sing another song as a rap.

16:14.040 --> 16:17.464
Did you steal the cover of
"Thicky Trick" from Mr. Canton?

16:17.510 --> 16:18.499
No.

16:18.540 --> 16:20.576
And can you explain
the similarities in the song?

16:20.610 --> 16:22.669
Well, I do know
that artistsare sponges.

16:22.710 --> 16:25.406
We take in the same information
from the zeitgeist,

16:25.450 --> 16:27.771
_ transmu_te it
into something new.

16:27.820 --> 16:31.347
And sometimes there is
a best way to do something.

16:31.390 --> 16:33.017
Uh, good artists
will oftenduplicate

16:33.060 --> 16:35.210
each other because they hit
on the best way

16:35.260 --> 16:38.184
at the same time.

16:38.230 --> 16:40.221
I, uh...

16:42.260 --> 16:45.468
Good. Good.

16:45.500 --> 16:47.195
MARX: _
Any more questions?

16:47.240 --> 16:48.662
Uh... uh...

16:49.800 --> 16:51.506
No.

16:51.540 --> 16:53.235
What was _that?
Questioning.

16:53.280 --> 16:55.373
No, it wasn't.
Questioning has a point.

16:55.410 --> 16:56.809
So you're saying
the zeitgeist made you do it?

16:56.840 --> 16:58.376
Oh, objection.

16:58.410 --> 16:59.547
It's argumentative.

16:59.580 --> 17:01.138
Misstates testimony.

17:01.180 --> 17:02.716
Inflammatory
and-and 12 other objections.

17:02.750 --> 17:05.241
_ _Which counselor
is questioning here, Your Honor?

17:05.290 --> 17:07.417
Yes, Mr. Preston.
Please leave it to Mr. Gardner

17:07.460 --> 17:08.415
to object.

17:08.460 --> 17:10.223
Objection. Argumentative.

17:10.260 --> 17:11.386
Sustained.

17:11.430 --> 17:12.783
So, you're saying that
two artists will hit

17:12.830 --> 17:14.422
on the same inspiration
at the same time?

17:14.460 --> 17:16.451
I'm saying that they can.

17:16.500 --> 17:17.762
And similarity does not
constitute theft.

17:17.800 --> 17:19.688
Similarity is
not a crime.

17:19.730 --> 17:22.460
That's how our culture
develops and grows.

17:22.500 --> 17:25.333
* Oh, my gosh, there she go

17:25.370 --> 17:27.406
* Watch all that
when she hit the floor *

17:27.440 --> 17:30.443
* Little mama got back
with her head full of tracks *

17:30.480 --> 17:33.347
* Claimin' other people kids
on her income tax *

17:33.380 --> 17:37.248
* Club hoppin', booty poppin',
drama makin'... *

17:37.290 --> 17:39.110
Do you hear any difference
between these two songs?

17:39.150 --> 17:42.449
I see two artists covering
the same song

17:42.490 --> 17:45.254
with similar comic instincts,
and that has resulted

17:45.290 --> 17:47.190
in similar instrumentation.

17:47.230 --> 17:48.322
Really?

17:48.360 --> 17:49.793
Really.

17:49.830 --> 17:53.436
* Her baby daddy still try
to come around *

17:53.470 --> 17:56.769
* Tryin' to get a taste
of that brown and brown *

17:56.800 --> 17:58.609
* Uh-uh, she ain't havin' that

17:58.640 --> 18:01.279
* Raised in the hood,
ghetto fabulous *

18:01.310 --> 18:03.505
* She kinda look bad, boy,
I must admit *

18:03.550 --> 18:07.247
* But she ain't nothing
but a thicky trick... *

18:07.280 --> 18:09.669
We need another attack.

18:19.830 --> 18:22.719
So you decided
to change?

18:22.760 --> 18:26.764
Yup. Into what I wore the night
you banged me the first time.

18:28.500 --> 18:30.468
That's pretty
low of you.

18:30.510 --> 18:33.775
I know. I wasn't
so discriminating back then.

18:36.340 --> 18:38.342
(chuckling)

18:41.550 --> 18:43.541
(phone rings)
WOMAN:
Doctor's office.

18:48.860 --> 18:50.851
Uh, are you
finished with that?

18:50.890 --> 18:52.448
Go ahead.
Thanks.

18:52.490 --> 18:53.752
How far along are you?

18:53.800 --> 18:55.722
Almost 19 weeks. You?

18:55.760 --> 18:58.866
Ten weeks. It's my
first ultrasound.

18:58.900 --> 19:00.868
So, this is what you have
to look forward to.

19:00.900 --> 19:03.164
(laughs)

19:04.310 --> 19:06.938
Oh, don't know where
my significant other is.

19:06.970 --> 19:10.474
Do, uh, people normally bring
their spouses with them?

19:10.510 --> 19:11.670
I don't know.
I'm not married.

19:11.710 --> 19:14.508
Gee, I don't even know if I want
to keep the father involved.

19:14.550 --> 19:16.347
I think it'll be hard
to keep mine away.

19:16.380 --> 19:18.189
What do you mean?

19:18.220 --> 19:19.642
I see him every day.

19:19.690 --> 19:21.817
I'm not even sure...

19:21.860 --> 19:23.179
There you are.

19:23.230 --> 19:25.881
I have been looking
for you everywhere.

19:25.930 --> 19:29.923
Hi. I'm Jenna.
Marilyn.

19:29.960 --> 19:31.518
So, you guys been
waiting long...

19:31.570 --> 19:32.696
KaHnda?

19:32.730 --> 19:33.662
No, not long.

19:33.700 --> 19:35.292
_ WOMAN:
Marilyn Garbanza?

19:35.340 --> 19:36.568
MARILYN:
Oh, that's me.

19:36.600 --> 19:37.635
Nice meeting you both.

19:37.670 --> 19:39.501
Good luck.
You, too.

19:40.540 --> 19:41.905
You following me?

19:41.940 --> 19:43.749
Yeah.

19:43.780 --> 19:45.338
Because Damian asked you to?

19:45.380 --> 19:46.699
Mm-hmm.

19:46.750 --> 19:47.739
Don't you ever do that.

19:49.320 --> 19:51.311
Not when I'm on the job.

19:53.860 --> 19:56.658
JENNA:
Let's get some lunch.

19:57.990 --> 20:00.390
All right,
dinner then.

20:04.600 --> 20:06.921
Say you're sorry.

20:06.970 --> 20:09.564
For what?

20:12.370 --> 20:15.635
All right, you know what
I hate more than anything?

20:15.680 --> 20:16.533
What?

20:16.580 --> 20:18.844
People who lose
their sense of humor.

20:18.880 --> 20:20.848
You know what I hate
more than anything?

20:20.880 --> 20:21.847
What?

20:21.880 --> 20:24.383
People who disrespect my work.

20:28.720 --> 20:30.722
I'm sorry.

20:31.760 --> 20:33.751
Dinner.

20:36.760 --> 20:38.421
Aanay, by the way...
I ask the questions...

20:38.470 --> 20:39.721
The hell it was.
Don't-don't...

20:39.770 --> 20:40.930
It's my cross.

20:40.970 --> 20:42.494
BURL:
No, I think it's best
that I cross.

20:42.540 --> 20:43.734
WILL: You think it's best
that you cross?
Your Honor,

20:43.770 --> 20:44.702
does counsel
have questions?

20:44.740 --> 20:46.264
My guess is, they do.

20:46.310 --> 20:47.504
Counselors?

20:47.540 --> 20:48.768
Mr. Canton. Hello.

20:48.810 --> 20:49.902
Hi.
Do you remember

20:49.940 --> 20:52.579
what you were doing
on July 28, 2012?

20:52.610 --> 20:55.773
I, uh... No.
I hope nothing bad.

20:55.820 --> 20:56.775
That was just one week

20:56.820 --> 20:58.412
before the anniversary
of your father's death,

20:58.450 --> 20:59.587
and you really don't remember?

20:59.620 --> 21:01.554
No. Do you remember
what you were doing

21:01.590 --> 21:03.649
the week before the anniversary
of your father's death?

21:03.690 --> 21:06.420
No, but I didn't speak
with such clarity

21:06.460 --> 21:09.691
about what I was doing on the
anniversary of my dad's death.

21:09.730 --> 21:11.721
Well, I guess you're a better
person than I am.

21:11.770 --> 21:14.762
Would it surprise you
to know you were

21:14.800 --> 21:19.533
on the studio lot
where Drama Camp is shot?

21:19.570 --> 21:21.709
Uh... yeah.

21:21.740 --> 21:25.005
I was asked to be a session
musman for a commerCIal.

21:25.050 --> 21:26.699
So, you were on the lot
where Mr. Tiller works,

21:26.750 --> 21:28.377
where_he_has his
inspirations?

21:28.420 --> 21:30.308
Yeah, I could feel his glow.

21:30.350 --> 21:31.715
ALICIA:
Objection.

21:31.750 --> 21:33.308
Mr. Canton was joking
with that answer.

21:33.360 --> 21:34.782
BURL:
Were you just joking,

21:34.820 --> 21:36.583
Mr. Canton?

21:36.620 --> 21:37.723
That I could feel
Mr. Tiller's glow

21:37.760 --> 21:39.648
when I was on the lot
where he worked?

21:39.690 --> 21:41.954
Uh, yes, that was a joke.

21:42.000 --> 21:44.389
BURL:
And did you know that Studio B,

21:44.430 --> 21:45.829
where you worked
as a session musician,

21:45.870 --> 21:48.065
shares a kitchenette
with Studio A...?

21:48.100 --> 21:49.692
Your Honor, let the plaintiff
present evidence

21:49.740 --> 21:52.004
that their client recorded
"Thicky Trick" in that studio,

21:52.040 --> 21:53.473
but this is just innuendo.

21:53.510 --> 21:54.670
WILL:
No.

21:54.710 --> 21:56.337
All we need
to do is show access.

21:56.380 --> 21:57.608
We're the ones
with the...

21:57.650 --> 21:58.776
Access does not
constitute theft.

21:58.810 --> 21:59.674
No, but access explains

21:59.710 --> 22:01.678
how two artists had
the same inspiration.

22:01.720 --> 22:02.778
It doesn't
explain anything.

22:02.820 --> 22:04.583
WILL:
Your Honor, we're the ones
with the derivative

22:04.620 --> 22:06.679
copyright. Can you explain
that to Mrs. Florrick?

22:06.720 --> 22:07.789
(overlapping chatter)

22:07.820 --> 22:09.811
(high-pitched squealing)

22:09.860 --> 22:13.694
Considering the evidence
presented,

22:13.730 --> 22:16.790
it seems clear to me
that Mr. Tiller

22:16.830 --> 22:21.767
acquired the derivative work
created by Mr. Rowby Canton.

22:21.800 --> 22:22.664
Yeah.

22:22.700 --> 22:25.737
But, unfortunately,
it doesn't matter.

22:25.770 --> 22:29.035
Mr. Canton, your song
was an unauthorized

22:29.080 --> 22:30.968
derivative artwork,

22:31.010 --> 22:33.717
therefore it is not protected.
What?

22:33.750 --> 22:35.377
And as odd as this may sound,

22:35.420 --> 22:36.978
this theft of your work
was legal.

22:37.020 --> 22:38.544
They have
the derivative copyright.

22:38.590 --> 22:41.559
You do not.
Defendants' motion is denied.

22:41.590 --> 22:44.923
Mr. Preston, Mr. Gardner,
your suit may go forward.
(gavelbangs)

22:50.930 --> 22:52.693
(commentator speaking faintly
over TV)

23:14.490 --> 23:16.481
So, how do you not
like Katy Perry?

23:17.690 --> 23:19.123
Um, I didn't say
I don't like her.

23:19.160 --> 23:20.923
I said I-I don't know
who she is.

23:20.960 --> 23:22.996
You don't know who she is? You
don't know who Katy Perry is?

23:23.030 --> 23:24.793
What are you,
like, 50 years old?

23:24.830 --> 23:26.923
You don't know "Roar"?
(chuckles)

23:26.970 --> 23:31.100
* I got the eye of the tiger
(laughs)

23:31.140 --> 23:33.904
* A fighter, I'm dancing

23:33.940 --> 23:35.908
* Through the fire

23:35.940 --> 23:39.046
* 'Cause_I am
a champion *

23:39.080 --> 23:42.811
* And you're
gonna hear me... *
(phone ringing)

23:48.720 --> 23:51.848
Yeah?

23:51.890 --> 23:54.051
Uh, yeah.

23:55.860 --> 23:57.225
No.

23:57.260 --> 23:59.467
Okay. Bye.

24:02.140 --> 24:04.631
Who was that?

24:04.670 --> 24:06.661
Um, it was my mom.

24:21.890 --> 24:22.982
ROWBY:
Okay, I don't get...

24:23.020 --> 24:25.625
So-so then we lost?

24:25.660 --> 24:27.218
No. Not yet.

24:27.260 --> 24:29.057
We're not letting them win.

24:30.630 --> 24:33.599
You were saying you covered
the song as a joke, right?

24:33.640 --> 24:37.701
Yeah. Like... (chuckles)
Rick Astley doing a rap.

24:37.740 --> 24:39.162
And the joke was what?
What, what made it funny?

24:39.210 --> 24:41.030
Well, ifI have
to explain the joke,

24:41.080 --> 24:43.173
I mean, it's not
a very good joke.

24:43.210 --> 24:45.041
Yeah, I know. But this is...
this is about legal stuff,

24:45.080 --> 24:46.945
so-so just tell me
what made it funny.

24:46.980 --> 24:49.210
Um... well, it's a...

24:49.250 --> 24:51.218
like, a r... a rap song,

24:51.250 --> 24:54.708
and we were singing it
like a Rick Astley,

24:54.760 --> 24:56.580
you know...

24:56.620 --> 24:59.123
like a rickroll.

24:59.160 --> 25:00.752
You're satirizing
the rap song.

25:00.800 --> 25:03.564
Well, sure.
Rap songs are usually
aggressive and hard,

25:03.600 --> 25:05.090
and you wanted to make fun
of the lyrics

25:05.130 --> 25:06.563
by singing them in a soft way.

25:06.600 --> 25:08.090
(chuckling):
Yeah, we were.

25:08.140 --> 25:11.007
Yeah, that's what... that's
what we were doing, right?

25:12.170 --> 25:14.809
What?

25:14.840 --> 25:16.569
Rowby's version of "Thiclq
Trick" was satire, Your Honor.

25:16.610 --> 25:19.272
No, it was a cover.

25:19.310 --> 25:21.039
And what does satire get you,
counselor?

25:21.080 --> 25:23.810
It's transformative.
It's a transformative artwork.

25:23.850 --> 25:25.044
Doesn't matter, Your Honor,
you already ruled.

25:25.090 --> 25:27.718
We have the derivative
copyright.
Yes, but you also believed

25:27.760 --> 25:29.819
that there was an actual theft
of Rowby's work.

25:29.860 --> 25:31.020
The only problem was

25:31.060 --> 25:33.085
Rowby didn't get
contractual approval to create

25:33.130 --> 25:34.893
a new artwork, right?
ALICIA:
But that doesn't matter.

25:34.930 --> 25:38.718
If Rowby satirized Rebel Kane's
original work, that makes

25:38.770 --> 25:40.123
it protected.

25:40.170 --> 25:42.297
Can I just say
that I love this stuff?

25:42.340 --> 25:44.763
I mean, I don't understand
a word you guys are saying,

25:44.810 --> 25:46.607
but this is awesome.

25:46.640 --> 25:49.006
If Rowby's song was
a transformative artwork,

25:49.040 --> 25:51.076
then an automatic copyright
was applied

25:51.110 --> 25:52.042
the moment he recorded it,

25:52.080 --> 25:54.844
and Mr. Tiller's theft
was an actual theft.

25:56.120 --> 25:59.214
Okay, Mr. Agos, you have
some room to maneuver here.

25:59.250 --> 26:02.617
Prove it's a transformative
artwork and I Will agree.

26:02.660 --> 26:03.979
There is a real theft.

26:04.030 --> 26:06.123
(gavelbangs)
ThEissocooL

26:06.160 --> 26:08.651
It's like, um... It's kind
of like jazz, right?

26:08.700 --> 26:10.998
It's like legal jazz.
DAMIAN:
Hey.

26:11.030 --> 26:12.167
Edelweiss.

26:12.200 --> 26:14.634
Edelman.
Do you know what this
meeting's about? Do you?

26:14.670 --> 26:16.968
Yeah, Will wants to lift
the solicitation ban.

26:17.000 --> 26:18.103
No. No.

26:18.140 --> 26:21.268
This is about you voting
with Will.

26:21.310 --> 26:23.608
See, Will made you partner.

26:23.650 --> 26:25.208
You owe him.

26:25.250 --> 26:28.139
No. Diane made me partner.
No.

26:28.180 --> 26:31.081
Will did.

26:31.120 --> 26:34.157
And he can unmake you
as partner.

26:34.190 --> 26:36.351
Good. We have a quorum.

26:36.390 --> 26:37.948
Where's David?

26:37.990 --> 26:39.628
Oh, David had a flat tire.

26:39.660 --> 26:40.820
Sadly.

26:43.770 --> 26:45.260
Anthony, which way
are you voting?

26:45.300 --> 26:48.337
You don't have
to tell her that.

26:48.370 --> 26:50.338
You're cooking the vote?

26:50.370 --> 26:54.374
Now, I move we lift the ban...
Actually, I have
to make some calls.

26:56.440 --> 26:58.305
We'll just vote
without you, Diane.

26:58.350 --> 27:01.046
Sue, Andrew, Vickie, will
you help me make some calls?

27:01.080 --> 27:01.910
Come on.

27:01.950 --> 27:03.178
You need 18 for a quorum.

27:03.220 --> 27:04.289
You just lost it.

27:05.920 --> 27:07.217
(horn honks)

27:07.250 --> 27:08.751
KALIN DA:
Peter!

27:08.790 --> 27:10.929
Pete. Do I know you?

27:10.960 --> 27:13.724
No, but you do know her.

27:13.760 --> 27:15.091
Marilyn Garbanza.

27:15.130 --> 27:17.189
Okay. And who are you?

27:17.230 --> 27:21.132
Uh, I'm an investigator working
on an inheritance matter.

27:21.170 --> 27:24.264
There's money due to Marilyn
and the father of her baby.

27:24.310 --> 27:25.868
And you see this?

27:25.910 --> 27:28.128
Says homecoming date,
September 7.

27:28.180 --> 27:30.808
That date matches the date

27:30.850 --> 27:32.670
of Marilyn's conception.

27:32.710 --> 27:34.678
Okay...

27:34.720 --> 27:38.349
So I thought...
you might be the father,

27:38.390 --> 27:40.142
given that it says
"Old Flame"

27:40.190 --> 27:43.455
and old flames have a tendency
to reignite at a reunion.

27:43.490 --> 27:45.253
Well, anyway, if it is you, uh,

27:45.290 --> 27:48.259
I have a few hundred thousand
dollars coming your way.

27:50.430 --> 27:52.398
I'm married.
I know, but...

27:52.430 --> 27:54.933
nobody has to know. And, like
I said, that's a lot of money.

27:54.970 --> 27:59.202
Look, did I want to reunite
with Marilyn over homecoming?

27:59.240 --> 28:01.231
Oh, yeah.

28:01.280 --> 28:03.373
But, in the middle
of our class dinner,

28:03.410 --> 28:05.970
she got a call
and she had to go.

28:06.010 --> 28:07.841
Go where?

28:07.880 --> 28:09.142
I don't know. She didn't say.

28:09.180 --> 28:11.080
Back to Springfield?

28:11.120 --> 28:12.382
She was working
for her boss that night.

28:12.420 --> 28:14.388
Her boss?

28:14.420 --> 28:16.183
Did she say who?

28:16.220 --> 28:19.383
No, she said "Peter."
That was about it.

28:19.430 --> 28:22.126
She was staying
at the Sheraton.

28:22.160 --> 28:23.991
Hey, could this be
about the governor?

28:24.030 --> 28:25.793
I know she was doing
some work for him.

28:25.830 --> 28:29.937
No, no. Look, um,
thanks for your time.

28:29.970 --> 28:31.267
MAN:
Douglas Landry-James,

28:31.310 --> 28:35.076
Dean of Musicology
at Chicago Poly Tech.
ALICIA: And you've...

28:35.110 --> 28:36.805
heard both songs at issue here,

28:36.840 --> 28:39.240
the original rap song
and Rowby's song?

28:40.350 --> 28:42.170
Sorry.

28:42.220 --> 28:44.245
I was waiting for my objection.

28:44.290 --> 28:46.485
No, I think the judge is aware
of what you're doing.

28:46.520 --> 28:49.250
What am I doing?
MARX: I have no idea
what either of you are doing,

28:49.290 --> 28:50.211
but let's shut up.

28:50.260 --> 28:53.320
In your expert opinion

28:53.360 --> 28:55.920
as a musicologist, sir,
would you call

28:55.960 --> 28:58.224
Rowby's song
satire?

28:58.270 --> 28:59.259
I would.
Even though

28:59.300 --> 29:02.360
he didn't change any
of the words, just the music.

29:02.400 --> 29:04.766
Especially for that reason.
The song's melodic line

29:04.810 --> 29:07.108
forces me to hear the lyrics
in a new context,

29:07.140 --> 29:09.973
as misogynistic and nihilistic.

29:10.010 --> 29:12.308
Absolutely not. It's not parody.
WILL:
And why not?

29:12.350 --> 29:14.341
Because the words
haven't been changed.

29:14.380 --> 29:16.268
In your expert opinion
as a musicologist,

29:16.320 --> 29:17.981
why is it important
to change the words?

29:18.020 --> 29:20.284
Bec_ause otherwise
I could just steal your novel

29:20.320 --> 29:21.958
and slap another cover on it.

29:21.990 --> 29:23.958
_ A romance cover
instead of a thriller.

29:23.990 --> 29:26.220
I could_call it satire
and sell it as my own.

29:26.260 --> 29:28.296
Originality must be protected.

29:28.330 --> 29:32.061
The other gentleman said
that changing the tune
was a transformation

29:32.100 --> 29:34.898
of actual content.
The other gentleman isn't very
well respected in his field.

29:34.940 --> 29:36.191
Oh, give it up, Liv.

29:36.240 --> 29:37.195
Bite me, Douglas.
Right.

29:37.240 --> 29:39.060
That's the way
you usually attack any argument.

29:39.110 --> 29:40.805
You want to get off
your high horse?
This is the woman

29:40.840 --> 29:43.331
who thinks karaoke is
a let century art...
Order. Order.

29:43.380 --> 29:45.405
* Vindictive, real vicious

29:45.450 --> 29:47.338
* And she always
in somebody business *

29:47.380 --> 29:49.371
* Swingin' with her name
in the bare booth *

29:49.420 --> 29:51.342
* But she take it off...
Mr. Kane,

29:51.390 --> 29:54.257
what was the intent of your song
"Thicky Trick"?

29:54.290 --> 29:56.850
I don't know. Uh...

29:56.890 --> 29:58.357
to make money.

29:58.390 --> 29:59.948
(chuckles)
Yeah.

29:59.990 --> 30:02.891
The lyrics here,
"Drama queen got the cops

30:02.930 --> 30:04.818
"knockin' at the door.

30:04.870 --> 30:06.428
"Hair shop, don't be late,

30:06.470 --> 30:08.563
waitin' on her Section Eight."

30:08.600 --> 30:11.467
Who's that describing?
No one, really. A...

30:11.510 --> 30:13.330
type of woman?
And these lyrics

30:13.370 --> 30:15.270
were intended
to debunk this woman?

30:15.310 --> 30:18.507
Take her down a notch?
Are you asking me,
"Are these lyrics satirical?"

30:18.550 --> 30:20.199
Yes.
Look,

30:20.250 --> 30:21.911
I'm not the guy
in that song.

30:21.950 --> 30:25.044
The narrator in the song--
I'm making a joke

30:25.090 --> 30:27.388
about that kind of guy,

30:27.420 --> 30:29.854
that kind of guy that would look
at women in this way.

30:29.890 --> 30:31.426
So it's a satire of rap songs?

30:31.460 --> 30:35.248
A satire of the clichd
braggish stance of rap songs?

30:35.300 --> 30:37.495
Yeah. Pretty much.
But that's what

30:37.530 --> 30:39.225
Rowby Canton says he's doing
with his cover,

30:39.270 --> 30:42.933
satirizing the clichd
braggish stance toward women.

30:42.970 --> 30:45.029
Yeah. I know.

30:45.070 --> 30:47.868
So he thinks _
he's satiri2ing something
that's already a satire?

30:47.910 --> 30:50.071
Yeah. Pretty much.

30:50.110 --> 30:51.577
Your Honor, a
transformative artwork

30:51.610 --> 30:54.443
must, by definition,
be transformative.

30:54.480 --> 30:57.984
Mr. Canton's cover is not
because Mr. Kane's song

30:58.020 --> 30:59.317
is.

30:59.350 --> 31:02.387
I never know which way
this is going with you.

31:02.420 --> 31:04.024
Good news, bad news,
you have

31:04.060 --> 31:05.652
the same poker face.

31:05.690 --> 31:07.521
Look, Marilyn, was

31:07.560 --> 31:10.449
at a class reunion
on the afternoon of September 7.

31:10.500 --> 31:12.388
Which is the...
Date of conception, yeah.

31:12.430 --> 31:13.362
Within a day or two.

31:13.400 --> 31:15.095
Good. A class reunion.

31:15.140 --> 31:16.960
That's why she wouldn't say
who the father is.

31:17.000 --> 31:18.661
There was a Peter there?

31:18.710 --> 31:21.076
Yeah, a Pete Berger.
Good.

31:21.110 --> 31:22.372
What's he do?
No, Eli.

31:22.410 --> 31:23.638
She had to leave
the reunion early

31:23.680 --> 31:26.376
'cause she was called away
by someone, someone

31:26.410 --> 31:28.378
named Peter.

31:28.420 --> 31:30.479
Okay, it's a common name.

31:30.520 --> 31:33.387
She was called to Springfield
by this someone named Peter.

31:35.560 --> 31:39.280
Was Peter in Springfield
7 September 2013?

31:41.300 --> 31:43.621
Damn.

31:43.660 --> 31:47.369
Marilyn went to meet this Peter
at the Sheraton at 10:00 pm.

31:47.400 --> 31:50.369
Do you know where...
the governor was?

31:50.400 --> 31:51.469
Did you go to the hotel?

31:51.510 --> 31:52.534
Yeah.

31:52.570 --> 31:54.128
Staff don't remember anything,

31:54.180 --> 31:56.068
so I tried_ to look
at the security footage,

31:56.110 --> 31:58.544
but the digital disc
for that day was gone.

31:58.580 --> 32:00.172
Gone? Why?
I don't know.

32:00.210 --> 32:01.973
Who took it?
I don't know, Eli.

32:02.020 --> 32:03.612
Blackmail?

32:03.650 --> 32:05.345
That would make sense.

32:09.490 --> 32:10.980
The governor, please.

32:11.030 --> 32:12.452
I don't have
to tell you.

32:12.490 --> 32:15.197
No, I-I will keep this quiet.

32:15.230 --> 32:17.653
Peter, Eli.

32:17.700 --> 32:20.362
We need to talk.

32:24.510 --> 32:27.104
* A round-the-way girl
that everybody know *

32:27.140 --> 32:29.677
* Be actin' like a lady
but she really is a... *

32:29.710 --> 32:31.041
* Never satisfied...

32:31.080 --> 32:32.172
ROBYN:
What do you need?

32:32.210 --> 32:33.973
Any reference online

32:34.020 --> 32:35.976
of Rowby's song being
a satire or a parody.

32:36.020 --> 32:38.614
Any reference?
Yes. In forum pages,

32:38.650 --> 32:43.019
in online chats, interviews,
reviews. Anything.

32:43.060 --> 32:45.085
You're looking for a consensus
you can present in court?
Yes.

32:45.130 --> 32:46.722
Or even the appearance
of a consensus.

32:46.760 --> 32:48.227
Just... give me anything.

32:48.260 --> 32:50.524
I'll build on it.
Is this a Hail Mary pass?

32:50.560 --> 32:52.664
Yes.

32:58.410 --> 33:00.105
Is Peter Florrick
the dad?

33:00.140 --> 33:03.405
No, Eli. We've had
this conversation.

33:03.440 --> 33:04.577
No, we didn't. You said

33:04.610 --> 33:05.599
you didn't want
to have this conversation.

33:05.650 --> 33:06.571
And I still don't.

33:06.610 --> 33:08.111
Hmm.

33:08.150 --> 33:10.448
So if someone has
the surveillance Videos

33:10.480 --> 33:11.788
from the Springfield Sheraton

33:11.820 --> 33:15.312
on September 7, 2013,
I'm not to worry?

33:17.420 --> 33:20.127
I... What are you...

33:20.160 --> 33:22.594
You're not helping calm
my nerves, Marilyn.

33:22.630 --> 33:24.222
Who talked to you?

33:24.270 --> 33:27.068
Who did you meet on September 7?

33:27.100 --> 33:28.089
Eli, you can't...

33:28.140 --> 33:28.959
Marilyn, I can.

33:29.000 --> 33:30.797
Do you think a reporter
isn't gonna do

33:30.840 --> 33:32.330
what I did in
an afternoon?
Are you checking up on me?

33:32.370 --> 33:35.168
This is my life! Of course
I'm checking up on you!

33:35.210 --> 33:36.438
This is my life!

33:36.480 --> 33:38.641
_ You don't delve_
into my personal busmess.

33:38.680 --> 33:39.704
You give up the rights
to privacy

33:39.750 --> 33:40.808
when you enter this office.

33:40.850 --> 33:42.147
I do.

33:42.180 --> 33:44.148
But he doesn't.

33:44.190 --> 33:47.148
The father of my baby doesn't.

33:50.360 --> 33:51.782
Okay, Marilyn,

33:51.830 --> 33:54.822
you choose this
man's privacy

33:54.860 --> 33:56.327
or the governor's career.

33:59.230 --> 34:02.028
Get out of my office, Eli.

34:05.570 --> 34:08.209
How are you?

34:08.240 --> 34:09.776
You don't like Katy Perry?

34:12.810 --> 34:15.278
(chuckles)

34:15.320 --> 34:17.276
Jenna and you--

34:17.320 --> 34:20.289
you tell each
other everything?

34:20.320 --> 34:22.288
Well, we're friends.

34:22.320 --> 34:24.151
You know?

34:24.190 --> 34:26.158
Don't you have friends?

34:26.190 --> 34:28.192
Um...

34:32.400 --> 34:36.131
She likes you,
by the way.

34:48.850 --> 34:52.149
(drum intro plays)

34:52.190 --> 34:54.613
(audio fast-forwarding)

34:54.660 --> 34:57.618
* Thicky thick triclq trick

34:57.660 --> 35:00.151
* She a thicky thick
tricky trick *
(knocking)

35:00.190 --> 35:03.250
* Thicky thick triclq trick

35:03.300 --> 35:06.827
* She a thicky thick
tricky trick... *

35:06.870 --> 35:09.259
(instrumental break)

35:09.300 --> 35:11.268
(audio rewinding)

35:11.310 --> 35:13.266
* She a thicky thick
tricky trick *

35:13.310 --> 35:16.404
* Thicky thick triclq trick

35:16.440 --> 35:19.147
* She a thicky thick
tricky trick... *
(bowling pins clatter)

35:19.180 --> 35:22.308
(instrumental break)

35:23.280 --> 35:26.579
Are we not friends anymore?

35:37.400 --> 35:42.167
There's a psychological break
between us, Will,

35:42.200 --> 35:43.838
not just a business one.

35:43.870 --> 35:47.237
Us or the firm?
Both. Let's start
with the firm.

35:47.270 --> 35:49.238
Alicia and the fourth years
leaving has...

35:49.280 --> 35:51.271
put us all on edge.

35:51.310 --> 35:52.607
Diane, I'm fine.

35:53.650 --> 35:54.810
I know.

35:54.850 --> 35:58.684
And it makes sense to charge
on ahead and not look back,

35:58.720 --> 36:01.314
but there is a frantic quality
to all of this,

36:01.360 --> 36:04.329
not just opening New York
but then L.A.?

36:04.360 --> 36:07.181
Look, I would agree there are
some things that are...

36:07.230 --> 36:09.653
psychological.

36:09.700 --> 36:13.192
But there are also some things
that are just themselves.

36:13.230 --> 36:15.198
This is just itself.
It's not just...

36:15.240 --> 36:17.959
I'm not done.

36:18.000 --> 36:19.501
Help me, Diane.

36:19.540 --> 36:23.306
Not by curbing me, by using me.

36:23.340 --> 36:24.773
Look at me.

36:24.810 --> 36:26.243
I'm fine.

36:26.280 --> 36:27.770
I'm... determined.

36:27.810 --> 36:31.314
This is not... about Alicia.

36:33.990 --> 36:36.288
Diane, you walked away.

36:36.320 --> 36:38.880
And now
you're back.

36:38.930 --> 36:40.727
I want you back.

36:40.760 --> 36:43.456
But I didn't walk away,

36:43.500 --> 36:45.627
and I should be given a chance
to do this.

36:45.670 --> 36:47.661
To lead.

36:49.300 --> 36:52.303
You're right.

36:54.580 --> 36:55.899
So you're voting with me?

36:59.450 --> 37:02.442
Whatever you want.

37:07.650 --> 37:09.584
_ ELI: _
No interruptions!

37:09.620 --> 37:11.383
It's Anne Stevens
from the Tribune.

37:11.430 --> 37:12.454
What does she want?

37:12.490 --> 37:13.422
You.

37:15.660 --> 37:16.627
Hello, Anne.

37:16.660 --> 37:18.264
You're working late.

37:18.300 --> 37:19.528
I thought the Tribune
was almost out of business.

37:19.570 --> 37:21.390
I need your comment
on something, Eli.

37:21.440 --> 37:22.930
Wow, you're sounding serious.

37:22.970 --> 37:24.335
I am serious.

37:24.370 --> 37:25.359
Tomorrow by 3:00,

37:25.410 --> 37:26.763
or we run with it
on the Web site.

37:26.810 --> 37:27.765
Run with what?

37:27.810 --> 37:28.799
You'll find out tomorrow.

37:28.840 --> 37:29.807
Hey.

37:29.840 --> 37:31.341
Give me a category, at least.

37:31.380 --> 37:33.371
A video.

37:37.880 --> 37:39.984
All right, three different
online reviews

37:40.020 --> 37:42.682
mentioned a sound
at a minute, 23.

37:42.720 --> 37:43.880
Wait, in...
in my arrangement?

37:43.920 --> 37:45.524
No, Drama Camp's.

37:45.560 --> 37:48.028
But not in the version
they eventually sold on iTunes.

37:48.060 --> 37:49.823
They had to deliver
earlier tracks

37:49.860 --> 37:50.952
to the Swedish iTunes.

37:51.000 --> 37:52.922
Why?
It's a big market.

37:52.970 --> 37:54.597
This is the version
they had up

37:54.640 --> 37:56.062
in Sweden before
they could change it.

37:56.100 --> 37:58.830
* Nothing but a tricky trick

37:58.870 --> 38:01.930
* Thicky thick triclq trick...

38:01.980 --> 38:02.969
What are we listening for?

38:03.010 --> 38:05.069
Uh, it's
at a minute, 23.

38:05.110 --> 38:06.907
* Thicky thick triclq trick

38:06.950 --> 38:08.349
* She a thicky thick

38:08.380 --> 38:09.642
* Triclq trick...

38:09.680 --> 38:12.342
(bowling pins clatter,
song continues)

38:12.390 --> 38:13.345
What?
I don't get it.

38:13.390 --> 38:14.379
Well, it's on the bass track.

38:14.420 --> 38:15.387
Listen.

38:15.420 --> 38:16.580
(song rewinding)

38:16.620 --> 38:18.326
* Thicky thick triclq trick...

38:18.360 --> 38:19.782
(bowling pins clatter,
song continues)

38:19.830 --> 38:21.354
Uh, I don't
get it.

38:21.400 --> 38:23.618
That's... balls.

38:23.660 --> 38:25.366
Balls, b...
it's bowl-bowling,

38:25.400 --> 38:27.027
it's like... oh, my God,
it's bowling balls.

38:27.070 --> 38:28.765
We recorded it
at Murray's work.

38:28.800 --> 38:30.768
And before they could
rerecord the tracks,

38:30.800 --> 38:33.769
Drama Camp's engineers
just recycled yours.

38:33.810 --> 38:35.004
That's theft.
I mean, I don't care

38:35.040 --> 38:36.075
what anyone says,
that's theft.

38:36.110 --> 38:36.974
That's like breaking-
into-my-house-

38:37.010 --> 38:39.069
and-and-stealing-
my-stuff kind of theft.

38:39.110 --> 38:41.578
You are awesome!

38:41.620 --> 38:42.575
(Robyn laughs)
Awesome!

38:42.620 --> 38:43.746
(engine idling)

38:49.020 --> 38:51.011
(siren wailing)

39:01.770 --> 39:03.761
(indistinct radio transmission)

39:07.070 --> 39:08.970
License and registration.

39:09.010 --> 39:10.568
What did
I do wrong?

39:10.610 --> 39:13.647
You didn't return
my calls.

39:14.720 --> 39:16.608
I think it's best
we just cool it.

39:16.650 --> 39:18.379
Why?

39:18.420 --> 39:19.739
I don't know
if I like you.

39:21.890 --> 39:22.857
You like me.

39:22.890 --> 39:25.859
I don't like how
much you talk.

39:25.890 --> 39:27.585
So this is about Damian.

39:28.730 --> 39:30.550
This about him
or me, or...?

39:32.030 --> 39:32.997
Can I go now?

39:33.030 --> 39:35.999
Yeah, you can go.

39:36.040 --> 39:38.508
Look, I just don't like
losing friends, okay?

39:38.540 --> 39:40.167
I mean, lovers
I don't mind,

39:40.210 --> 39:41.404
butfnends?

39:42.040 --> 39:44.702
They come
through.

39:44.750 --> 39:46.399
So don't make this
about him or me.

39:48.450 --> 39:49.644
Drive safely.

39:49.680 --> 39:51.989
Yeah.

39:57.120 --> 40:00.123
* She ain't nothing
but a tricky trick *

40:00.160 --> 40:02.594
* Thicky thick triclq trick

40:02.630 --> 40:04.769
* She a thicky thick
tricky trick *

40:04.800 --> 40:06.927
* Thicky thick

40:06.970 --> 40:09.097
* Triclq trick...
I am getting so sick
of this song.

40:09.140 --> 40:09.890
Here it comes.

40:09.940 --> 40:12.807
(bowling pins clatter)
You ready?

40:12.840 --> 40:13.966
Did you
hear that?

40:14.010 --> 40:16.069
Those are bowling
balls hitting pins.

40:16.110 --> 40:19.705
And you can see it right there
and right there.

40:21.680 --> 40:23.443
There's my version
of the song.

40:23.480 --> 40:25.186
You see? Right there,
that's my version,

40:25.220 --> 40:27.188
and that is Tiller's.

40:27.220 --> 40:30.451
Bowling ball
and bowling ball.

40:30.490 --> 40:31.957
They're the same.

40:31.990 --> 40:33.150
It doesn't
mean anything.
It doesn't mean...

40:33.190 --> 40:34.919
That's our song,
he stole our song.

40:34.960 --> 40:36.757
We have
the derivative copyright.

40:36.800 --> 40:37.459
Doesn't give you
the right to steal.

40:37.500 --> 40:39.991
They stole Rowby's actual track.

40:40.030 --> 40:41.566
Then they recorded their own

40:41.600 --> 40:43.864
before putting it in
the domestic iTunes store.

40:43.900 --> 40:45.231
That is theft.

40:45.270 --> 40:46.737
Actual theft.

40:46.770 --> 40:47.737
Prove it in court.

40:47.770 --> 40:48.805
Sure.

40:50.780 --> 40:52.600
But before you do something
to satisfy your ego,

40:52.650 --> 40:54.641
I'd check with
my client first.

40:55.980 --> 40:57.572
I'll handle my client,
you handle yours.

40:57.620 --> 40:58.644
Ours.

41:00.250 --> 41:03.686
You got your hand
caught in the cookie
jar, Mr. Preston.

41:03.720 --> 41:06.587
You can't pretend the
cookie jar doesn't exist.

41:06.630 --> 41:08.598
May I speak to you for a second,

41:08.630 --> 41:10.097
Mr. Gardner?

41:16.970 --> 41:18.938
I th...
I think we just won.

41:18.970 --> 41:20.062
(laughs)

41:20.110 --> 41:21.065
Well, there's a first
for everything.

41:21.110 --> 41:22.839
This feels incredible!

41:22.880 --> 41:24.609
I could... I could definitely
get used to this.

41:24.650 --> 41:26.538
Oh, you did it!
(squeals)

41:26.580 --> 41:29.140
Oh, my God,
you're amazing.

41:30.920 --> 41:32.683
Eli Gold,
what a pleasure.

41:32.720 --> 41:34.210
Why do I feel like I'm
about to be devoured?

41:34.250 --> 41:35.251
I have no idea.

41:35.290 --> 41:36.848
What's happening,
Anne?

41:36.890 --> 41:39.029
I'm looking for
a comment, Eli.

41:39.060 --> 41:40.948
On...? _
An anonymous tip

41:40.990 --> 41:42.594
that was sent
to my office.

41:42.630 --> 41:44.996
You want me to comment
on an anonymous tip?

41:45.030 --> 41:47.021
That's an old
reporter's trick.

41:47.070 --> 41:49.595
Throw any random
aspersions

41:49.640 --> 41:51.733
on the candidate,
then get me to deny it

41:51.770 --> 41:53.635
so you can use
the denial as the story.

41:53.670 --> 41:55.535
Well, this one was sent with

41:55.580 --> 41:56.933
a surveillance
Video.

41:56.980 --> 42:00.108
Anne, you know how unreliable
surveillance videos are.

42:05.590 --> 42:07.080
(Anne sighs)

42:07.120 --> 42:08.246
Now, the tip says,

42:08.290 --> 42:10.315
"Here's evidence
of Peter Florrick

42:10.360 --> 42:11.657
"stealing an election.

42:11.690 --> 42:12.987
Happy hunting."

42:13.030 --> 42:15.225
Any comment?

42:23.040 --> 42:25.099
Eli...

42:25.140 --> 42:27.335
I thought about what
you said about privacy,

42:27.370 --> 42:28.837
and I want
you to know

42:28.880 --> 42:30.233
that H approached
the father,

42:30.280 --> 42:32.248
and he said he'd be
willing to come forward.

42:32.280 --> 42:34.771
I want you
to meet Peter.

42:34.820 --> 42:37.175
Hi.
Peter Bogdanovich.

42:37.220 --> 42:38.710
He was in town
directing a move,

42:38.750 --> 42:39.910
and we just...

42:39.950 --> 42:41.212
well.
Yeah.

42:41.250 --> 42:42.956
Marilyn was trying
to protect me,

42:42.990 --> 42:45.026
but I'm fine if you
need me to go public.

42:49.730 --> 42:51.721
Eli?

42:53.200 --> 42:55.191
Isn't that
good of him?

42:56.370 --> 42:57.337
This is good news.
