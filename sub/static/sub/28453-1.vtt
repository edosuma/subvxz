So, how are you feeling?

02:59.800 --> 03:01.802
[Roza] Oh, uh,
two David Hallwrights.

03:01.871 --> 03:04.080

-[Elke] Dad, you stink.
-[Simon chuckles]

03:13.158 --> 03:14.884
[Ford] But it's a winning stink.

03:15.678 --> 03:16.989
[Ford] How's hockey practice,

03:18.439 --> 03:19.095
-Coach doing what she's told?
-[Claire] Yeah, right.

03:24.100 --> 03:25.446
Hey, so, chicken's been cooked.

03:25.515 --> 03:26.861
You just need to
dress the salad.

03:32.729 --> 03:34.490
[Simon] You look nice.
Where are you off to?

03:34.766 --> 03:36.388
Fundraising meeting at Tish's.

03:36.595 --> 03:37.527
[Simon] Ah.

03:39.046 --> 03:39.667
How much is it costing me
this time? [breathing heavily]

03:40.461 --> 03:41.359
The usual.

03:42.601 --> 03:44.465
[Simon] Come on, Karen,
haven't we done our bit?

03:44.776 --> 03:46.950
David Hallwright's gonna
be the next prime minister.

03:47.468 --> 03:48.952
Don't you wanna be
a part of that?

03:49.021 --> 03:50.506
[sirens blaring]

03:56.753 --> 03:58.030
[Karen] Ford,
keep the girls here.

04:05.866 --> 04:09.870
[eerie music playing]

04:23.608 --> 04:24.574
Shit.

04:27.508 --> 04:29.372
Tish, are you all right?

04:29.821 --> 04:31.788
Yeah, I am, but Julia...

04:32.099 --> 04:33.411
Yeah, what... what about her?

04:34.619 --> 04:35.344
The pool man said
she's been murdered.

04:36.552 --> 04:37.898
-What? What did she say?
-[Karen] Oh, Ford,

04:37.967 --> 04:39.486
you're supposed
to keep them inside.

04:39.555 --> 04:40.556
[Ford] They got away on me.

04:40.625 --> 04:42.040
Obviously, tonight, the meeting.

04:42.109 --> 04:43.524
[Karen] Of course, go, go.

04:46.182 --> 04:48.184
-Murdered?
-You don't have to whisper.

04:48.253 --> 04:49.703
People get murdered
all the time.

04:49.944 --> 04:51.360
Not around here, they don't.

[camera shutter clicking]

05:17.869 --> 05:20.699
[Da Silva] Julia Stevens,
42, separated.

05:20.768 --> 05:23.633
Lived here on her own.
Multiple stab wounds, one fatal.

05:23.840 --> 05:24.979
There's signs of a struggle,

05:25.048 --> 05:27.775
but so far,
not of any sexual assault.

05:28.776 --> 05:29.915
Murder weapon?

05:29.984 --> 05:31.331
Forensics are on to it.

05:32.884 --> 05:33.850
Could be one of her own knives
but they look pretty clean.

05:35.093 --> 05:35.921
[Da Silva]
Looks like she just got home.

05:35.990 --> 05:36.922
[Gregan] You got a time on that?

05:38.372 --> 05:39.787
[Da Silva] Uh, supermarket
receipt says 8:30, Sunday.

05:39.856 --> 05:42.411
Looks like she was killed
shortly after arriving home,

05:42.480 --> 05:44.516
around 9:30,
so, dead approximately 20 hours.

05:44.585 --> 05:45.448
[John] Where is she?

05:46.829 --> 05:48.865
-Oh, Christ, no.
-Mr. Stevens?

05:48.934 --> 05:49.797
[John] Yes.

05:51.281 --> 05:52.455
[Da Silva] I'm really sorry,
but I'm gonna have to ask

05:52.524 --> 05:53.663
you a few questions
about Mrs. Stevens.

05:54.077 --> 05:55.113
You two are married?

05:55.182 --> 05:57.771
Um, about to be divorced.

05:58.599 --> 06:00.014
And when was the last time
you spoke?

06:00.567 --> 06:01.671
We don't.

06:02.500 --> 06:04.087
There hasn't been much speaking.

06:05.261 --> 06:06.952
[John] I had an e-mail
from her yesterday.

06:08.195 --> 06:10.439
And if you don't mind me
asking, what did she say?

06:10.508 --> 06:12.820
Oh, that I was scum.
She'd hoped I'd die.

06:15.305 --> 06:16.824
I met somebody else, so...

06:18.585 --> 06:19.689
Oh, Julia, she...

06:22.036 --> 06:23.210
She wasn't happy about it.

06:24.832 --> 06:26.420
She wasn't happy about anything.

06:30.182 --> 06:31.218
Thank you.

06:37.224 --> 06:38.501
[pen scribbling]

06:43.541 --> 06:45.681
[crickets chirping]

06:48.028 --> 06:49.616
[man on TV] Police have
reported that a woman's body

06:49.685 --> 06:52.895
has been found in the Auckland
suburb of Remuera tonight.

06:53.102 --> 06:55.587
While the death is being treated
as suspicious,

06:55.863 --> 06:58.003
no further details have been
released to the public.

06:58.935 --> 07:01.766
Police are appealing to anyone
in the area to come forward

07:01.835 --> 07:02.905
if they have any information--

07:02.974 --> 07:04.285
[David]
Ed, are you watching this?

07:04.354 --> 07:07.599
[Ed] Police under pressure,
creeping crime rate.

07:08.151 --> 07:09.187
[David] This, we can use.

07:10.637 --> 07:12.259
Take the spotlight off
Mrs. Hallwright for a change.

07:12.328 --> 07:14.641
[man on TV] Future New Zealand
party candidate David Hallwright

07:14.882 --> 07:17.057
launched his prime ministerial
campaign today.

07:17.402 --> 07:19.749
But critics say
the slick campaign launch

07:19.818 --> 07:21.889
was overshadowed
by his wife's latest gaffe.

07:24.409 --> 07:25.617
It was an eye roll.

07:26.031 --> 07:27.067
I don't need media training.

07:27.136 --> 07:28.965
I just need to stop rolling
my eyes.

07:29.207 --> 07:30.104
Look.

07:31.243 --> 07:32.935
-There, see, I'm trained.
-[chuckles]

07:34.937 --> 07:36.041
Don't take it personally.

07:36.110 --> 07:37.629
It was just the campaign's
thinking--

07:37.698 --> 07:38.665
You mean it's Ed's thinking.

07:39.976 --> 07:40.045
[David] It's a matter
of public perception.

07:41.288 --> 07:42.220
We can't ignore it.
We need the public.

07:43.083 --> 07:44.947
Yeah, well, my perception

07:45.016 --> 07:47.570
is that unless I rise up
out of your first wife's grave

07:47.639 --> 07:48.571
reincarnated,

07:50.021 --> 07:50.711
Ed's gonna keep hating me,
along with everyone else.

07:53.058 --> 07:54.197
[David] Hey.

07:54.784 --> 07:56.855
[sighs] Nobody hates you.

07:58.961 --> 08:00.825
You're the most amazing
woman I've ever met.

08:10.006 --> 08:12.733
I was hoping all our hard work
would've paid off by now.

08:13.700 --> 08:16.150
-Oh, hard work, was it?
-[chuckles]

08:16.461 --> 08:19.188
Yeah, what wonders that would
do for those perceptions.

08:20.292 --> 08:21.639
Oh, you smell good.

08:22.881 --> 08:23.882
It's just... it's ridiculous
pretending to be

08:23.951 --> 08:24.987
someone I'm not.

08:26.678 --> 08:28.922
We're all pretending to be
someone we're not.

Did you check
the girls' windows?

08:47.941 --> 08:49.114
Yeah, I said that I would.

09:58.701 --> 10:00.047
[man on TV] While in Auckland,
police have formally released

10:00.116 --> 10:00.185
the identity
of the murder victim.

10:02.222 --> 10:03.568
-Julia Stevens' body was...
-Can't sleep?

10:03.637 --> 10:05.190
[Ford] Nah, not with
a bloody killer on the loose.

10:05.259 --> 10:06.088
[man on TV] ...expect
the murder occurred

10:06.157 --> 10:07.676
on Sunday night.

10:09.263 --> 10:10.817
The former model was found
dead at her home,

10:10.886 --> 10:13.198
and police are appealing
to anyone in the area

10:13.267 --> 10:15.269
to come forward if they
have any information or...

10:15.338 --> 10:17.858
Isn't she the psycho that turned
up at the house the other day?

[birds chirping]

10:47.508 --> 10:48.648
Thanks, mate.

10:50.201 --> 10:51.443
The ex's alibi checked out?

10:51.512 --> 10:53.204
Tight as. Wasn't him.

10:57.070 --> 10:58.347
[knocks]

11:03.076 --> 11:04.456
-Hello.
-DS. Da Silva.

11:04.525 --> 11:05.457
Detective Bennett.

11:06.596 --> 11:07.770
Sorry to bother you,
Mrs. Lampton?

11:08.081 --> 11:09.013
Yes.

11:09.220 --> 11:10.773
This about Julia Stevens?

11:11.498 --> 11:13.396
It's horrendous.
[sighs] Come in.

11:18.988 --> 11:20.507
-[door closing]
-[Karen] Come on through.

11:26.547 --> 11:28.998
Did you know Julia,
Mrs. Lampton?

11:29.067 --> 11:30.137
Oh, to look at.

11:31.518 --> 11:32.899
We met at a David Hallwright
fundraising thing once,

11:32.968 --> 11:34.279
but that was about it.

11:35.384 --> 11:37.489
But I was at the house,
right next door,

11:38.076 --> 11:39.940
the night she... she was killed.

11:40.630 --> 11:41.804
That's why we're here.

11:42.978 --> 11:44.220
The book club meeting,
is that right?

11:44.289 --> 11:46.188
[Karen] Yes. Yeah.
We were all there, just...

11:46.982 --> 11:48.052
I didn't see a thing.

11:49.329 --> 11:50.951
I mean, not that I was looking,
but you know.

11:52.435 --> 11:54.368
Well,
no one can quite believe it.

11:55.438 --> 11:57.855
Sorry, can I...
can I get you a tea, coffee?

11:58.579 --> 11:59.511
I'm fine.

12:00.409 --> 12:01.790
Just water will be great.

12:03.170 --> 12:05.966
There's been a spate of
burglaries in the area recently.

12:06.449 --> 12:07.450
Did you know that?

12:08.141 --> 12:09.038
Could be connected.

12:10.350 --> 12:11.144
Oh, we're looking
at all the possibilities.

12:11.903 --> 12:13.042
So, who else lives here?

12:13.111 --> 12:16.425
Oh, my two teenage girls,
Elke and Claire.

12:16.494 --> 12:18.358
Simon, my husband, and
for my sins,

12:18.427 --> 12:19.393
his brother, Ford.

12:20.705 --> 12:21.741
The brother a problem for you,
Mrs. Lampton?

12:21.810 --> 12:24.398
No. Oh, no, no, God, no.
He's just...

12:24.674 --> 12:27.401
in between girlfriends,
houses, you know?

12:27.919 --> 12:29.472
Seems to quite like it here.

12:29.679 --> 12:31.026
Do you know where Simon
and Ford were

12:31.095 --> 12:32.372
-on Sunday night?
-[Karen] Yes.

12:32.959 --> 12:34.167
They were here, both of them.

12:34.374 --> 12:36.065
Can you be sure?
If you were out?

12:36.410 --> 12:37.964
Absolutely.

12:38.033 --> 12:40.552
They let the girls watch
The Shining.I was furious.

12:50.045 --> 12:52.185
I'll get some uniforms
to work on some rego's.

12:52.530 --> 12:53.427
Yeah.

12:54.808 --> 12:55.602
And there could be something
in those burglaries.

Oh.

13:19.074 --> 13:20.247
[sighs]

13:21.490 --> 13:22.802
I've just got the cakes
and the decorations

13:22.871 --> 13:25.183
for Robin's going-away.
Can I just leave them here?

13:25.252 --> 13:26.564
Gonna have to park miles away.

13:28.117 --> 13:29.153
[exhales]

13:30.119 --> 13:31.189
[Ann] Got what you wanted.

[crickets chirping]

[music playing]

14:11.505 --> 14:12.644
[Karen] Girls, dinner.

14:13.922 --> 14:15.613
I can't believe there's
a murderer out there.

14:15.682 --> 14:16.786
[Simon] Oh, look,
I know you're worried,

14:16.856 --> 14:18.719
but lightning
doesn't strike twice.

14:18.788 --> 14:20.100
Actually, you know, from, uh,

14:21.619 --> 14:22.654
a tree surgeon's perspective,
that's not entirely true.

14:22.723 --> 14:24.173
Can we not liken
Julia Stevens to a tree.

14:24.484 --> 14:25.623
[wheezes]

14:25.692 --> 14:28.074
[Karen] Oh,
here's the birthday girl.

14:29.454 --> 14:31.077
My baby, 13!

14:31.801 --> 14:33.320
You're getting all grown-up
on me.

14:33.734 --> 14:35.219
She doesn't even wear a bra yet.

14:35.288 --> 14:37.186
-[Elke] Shut up!
-Claire, it's her birthday.

14:37.255 --> 14:39.050
-[cell phone ringing]
-Can we just be nice?

14:39.809 --> 14:41.018
You gonna check that?

14:42.122 --> 14:43.261
They'll leave a message
if it's urgent.

14:43.675 --> 14:44.469
Oh.

14:45.677 --> 14:47.438
Look at that, birthday magic.

14:48.163 --> 14:50.959
Hey, so, your golden girl got
a pasting in the media today.

14:51.235 --> 14:53.133
-Who?
-[Ford] Roza Hallwright.

14:53.202 --> 14:54.548
Dick move parking in
a disabled space.

14:54.617 --> 14:55.515
Claire!

14:56.861 --> 14:57.413
I don't know why everyone
doesn't leave her alone.

14:57.482 --> 14:58.656
I like her.

14:58.725 --> 15:00.761
Anyway, he's the one
we'll be voting for.

15:00.830 --> 15:02.349
Our old man would have
a fit if he saw you chucking

15:02.418 --> 15:03.281
money at that lot.

15:04.489 --> 15:05.801
[Claire] You should be giving it
to the Greens.

15:05.870 --> 15:06.940
[Elke] Did you know
there's an island of plastic

15:07.009 --> 15:08.390
as big as Mexico
in the Pacific Ocean?

15:08.459 --> 15:09.667
[cell phone ringing]

15:10.150 --> 15:11.186
Just check it, will ya?

15:12.463 --> 15:13.913
-[Karen] It might be urgent.
-I told you...

15:18.779 --> 15:19.988
[cell phone beeps]

15:20.057 --> 15:21.299
[Elke] Is it a baby?

15:29.445 --> 15:30.930
A breech. [sighs]

15:32.310 --> 15:34.105
I organized cover, I don't know
why they're hassling me.

15:34.312 --> 15:36.280
[Elke] Because you're the best,
that's why.

15:36.349 --> 15:37.695
Yeah, you should go,
Dad,

15:37.764 --> 15:40.146
'cause what the planet needs is
a lot more population.

15:40.215 --> 15:43.218
-[chuckles]
-No. Thirteen... cake.

15:43.494 --> 15:44.460
I'll save you some.

15:54.367 --> 15:55.471
I dare you

15:55.920 --> 15:57.266
to eat it all yourself.

15:58.474 --> 15:59.648
Love you all.

16:00.856 --> 16:02.375
-Even you, you old leftie.
-[Ford] Mm-hmm.

16:02.444 --> 16:03.376
See you later.

16:17.390 --> 16:20.289
-[horn blaring]
-[thunder rumbling]

16:20.634 --> 16:23.085
[rain pattering]

16:25.777 --> 16:29.402
[ominous music playing]

16:41.897 --> 16:44.417
[man] Four seventy-eight!
Four seventy-eight!

16:44.934 --> 16:46.419
Four seventy-eight!

16:51.596 --> 16:52.632
[dog barking]

16:52.701 --> 16:54.461
[seat belt clicks]

16:55.462 --> 16:58.293
[ominous music continues]

16:58.534 --> 17:01.089
[thunder rumbles]

17:06.922 --> 17:08.061
[chuckles]

17:09.994 --> 17:11.306
I was with my family.

17:12.376 --> 17:13.411
Now you're with me.

17:27.218 --> 17:29.358
[thunder rumbles]

17:30.187 --> 17:33.259
[ominous music continues]

17:50.034 --> 17:53.244
[water splashes]

17:55.936 --> 17:59.285
[suspenseful music playing]

18:03.875 --> 18:07.086
[suspenseful music continues]

18:29.453 --> 18:32.352
[indistinct chatter]

18:34.285 --> 18:35.286
Sorry, I'm late.

18:37.702 --> 18:38.876
What's going on?

18:38.945 --> 18:40.395
You'll never guess
who's in your office.

18:41.085 --> 18:42.362
My first appointment?

18:48.920 --> 18:49.852
Mrs. Hallwright?

18:50.991 --> 18:52.200
Roza, please.

18:53.718 --> 18:56.652
Sorry for barging in on you
like this, but it couldn't wait.

18:57.688 --> 18:58.792
If you're after treatment,

18:58.861 --> 19:00.035
I do need referral
from your doctor.

19:00.104 --> 19:02.279
No, no, no, it's...
it's not about that.

19:03.970 --> 19:05.799
I'm sorry, then how can I help?

19:06.869 --> 19:09.217
Uh, well, it's...
it's personal, I suppose.

19:11.909 --> 19:14.498
God, sorry, I am making this
sound very cloak and dagger,

19:14.567 --> 19:15.913
aren't I? Um...

19:16.362 --> 19:17.846
No, it's just you've been
so generous

19:18.053 --> 19:19.606
with your donations
and your wife

19:19.675 --> 19:20.987
with her campaign work,

19:21.608 --> 19:23.403
and, uh,
it hasn't gone unnoticed.

19:23.955 --> 19:25.992
Well, thank you. [chuckles]

19:26.475 --> 19:29.720
We think David-- you and David
are doing a great job.

19:30.099 --> 19:31.687
Well, you can tell him
in person.

19:31.756 --> 19:33.379
We're having drinks at home
on Friday night.

19:33.448 --> 19:34.656
We'd love for you to come.

19:36.934 --> 19:38.694
I don't know what to say.
[chuckles]

19:39.316 --> 19:40.248
Say you'll be there.

19:40.938 --> 19:42.284
You have two girls, right?

19:43.492 --> 19:44.631
Yeah, bring them.

19:55.711 --> 19:56.574
[chuckles]

19:57.955 --> 19:58.369
She just turned up
out of the blue at his clinic?

19:58.438 --> 19:59.474
I know.

19:59.543 --> 20:00.716
Did he fall
in a helpless swoon

20:00.785 --> 20:02.373
like most of the men
she seems to captivate?

20:02.442 --> 20:03.512
I don't know.

20:03.581 --> 20:06.377
Simon,
Roza turn you weak at the knees?

20:06.584 --> 20:09.069
[scoffs] I was too surprised
to notice, to be honest.

20:09.138 --> 20:11.348
Wow, you really are
the perfect husband.

20:11.417 --> 20:12.349
[Simon laughs]

20:12.418 --> 20:13.419
Hey, I'm Ford,

20:14.696 --> 20:15.973
his brother, tree guy,
over-stayer in general.

20:16.870 --> 20:17.768
Tish.

20:18.976 --> 20:19.839
Karen, you never told me
there was a second

20:19.908 --> 20:20.805
charming prince in the family.

20:22.013 --> 20:23.670
Well, she has told us a lot
about you.

20:25.154 --> 20:27.295
Hmm, well, as it happens,
I have a rather large garden

20:27.364 --> 20:28.572
crying out for an arborist.

20:28.641 --> 20:30.056
Dare I ask you to come
and give me a quote?

20:30.125 --> 20:31.333
Well, actually, there's a tree

20:32.817 --> 20:33.577
a little bit closer to home
that needs some attention.

20:34.647 --> 20:35.579
I thought the jury was out
on that.

20:36.925 --> 20:39.065
-I love that tree.
-No, no, it's rotten, has to go.

20:39.859 --> 20:40.860
So...

20:42.206 --> 20:43.311
Okay, then.

20:44.484 --> 20:45.554
Nice to meet you, Tish.

20:48.971 --> 20:52.941
[gear ratchets]

21:02.537 --> 21:03.641
[Simon] What do you think?

21:05.919 --> 21:07.645
[Ford] Yeah, definitely got
some rot in here.

21:08.128 --> 21:09.406
The rest of it looks fine.

21:10.545 --> 21:11.580
The best thing about rot

21:13.099 --> 21:13.996
is that it eats away from
the inside, and then one day,

21:14.894 --> 21:15.964
everything just falls apart.

21:16.689 --> 21:17.483
Literally.

21:18.691 --> 21:20.140
Can we just wait for the day?

21:20.209 --> 21:22.004
Yeah, I can do some thinning
and put some kerosene in it,

21:22.073 --> 21:23.420
but the rot's still there, bro.

21:24.144 --> 21:25.663
I can live with that. [sighs]

21:26.802 --> 21:28.114
So can Karen.

21:29.218 --> 21:30.358
Good luck with that.

21:38.262 --> 21:41.300
[suspenseful music playing]

21:43.129 --> 21:44.406
[Da Silva] Simon Lampton?

21:45.649 --> 21:46.477
Husband of Mrs. Lampton
from the book club?

21:47.547 --> 21:47.616
[Singh]
Quite the e-mail exchange.

21:49.031 --> 21:52.103
"I'm gonna ruin you,
you arrogant bastard." Jesus.

21:52.897 --> 21:55.659
That's not all.
Simon Lampton has a record.

21:56.694 --> 21:58.386
-You mind if I...
-Hmm.

22:01.078 --> 22:04.461
[computer keys clack]

22:05.634 --> 22:06.808
Aggravated assault.

22:28.864 --> 22:30.418
[knocking on door]

22:34.042 --> 22:35.423
[Da Silva] Dr. Lampton?

22:35.699 --> 22:37.217
-Yes.
-DS. Da Silva.

22:37.286 --> 22:38.943
Detective Bennett.
We were here yesterday.

22:39.012 --> 22:40.842
-Hi, Mrs. Lampton.
-Hi.

22:41.290 --> 22:42.637
What can we do for you?

22:42.913 --> 22:44.121
[Da Silva]
Just a routine follow-up.

22:44.190 --> 22:45.122
Come in.

22:50.230 --> 22:51.853
-Where are the girls?
-Up... Up in their rooms.

22:52.301 --> 22:53.855
Can I have a word
in the kitchen?

22:56.547 --> 22:57.755
Uh, in here.

22:58.273 --> 22:59.516
If you don't mind.

23:06.074 --> 23:08.214
[exhales]
I'm sorry, this is ludicrous.

23:08.732 --> 23:09.905
[Da Silva] In what way?

23:11.182 --> 23:11.873
I'm not gonna murder someone
for sending me

23:11.942 --> 23:12.977
threatening e-mails.

23:14.185 --> 23:15.566
[Da Silva]
Why? You get a lot of them?

23:16.843 --> 23:18.500
No. [sighs]

23:18.776 --> 23:20.675
But in this situation,
I don't blame her.

23:20.744 --> 23:22.504
That's very understanding
of you.

23:23.298 --> 23:27.613
Look, IVF hadn't worked.
Her marriage was falling apart.

23:28.096 --> 23:30.685
She was a woman in her forties,
and she went off the deep end.

23:30.926 --> 23:32.583
[Bennett] Were you aware that
your husband had been

23:32.652 --> 23:33.998
corresponding
with Julia Stevens?

23:34.067 --> 23:35.068
Corresponding how?

23:35.137 --> 23:36.242
[Da Silva]
Have other patients ever

23:36.311 --> 23:38.037
threatened to get you
"struck off,"

23:38.106 --> 23:39.832
to "ruin your life,"

23:39.901 --> 23:42.317
to "make sure that you
never practice medicine again"?

23:42.386 --> 23:43.629
She was unhinged.

23:44.319 --> 23:45.424
I felt sorry for her.

23:46.908 --> 23:48.116
If she was a patient, of course,
I wouldn't know about it.

23:49.531 --> 23:50.981
So, you weren't here
the day she came to the house?

23:52.154 --> 23:53.017
This house?

23:54.433 --> 23:55.882
Did you tell your wife
about Julia Stevens' visit?

23:56.227 --> 23:58.195
No. It'd only worry her.

23:58.713 --> 23:59.886
And it didn't worry you?

24:01.301 --> 24:03.200
I told you. [sighs]
She wasn't in her right mind.

24:03.269 --> 24:04.822
I never took it seriously.

24:05.064 --> 24:07.169
It's an insult you're even here
talking to him.

24:08.895 --> 24:10.725
He's a highly respected
obstetrician--

24:10.794 --> 24:11.967
Did you know
your husband has a conviction

24:12.036 --> 24:13.244
for aggravated assault?

24:16.593 --> 24:19.561
Are you even allowed
to bring that up? I was 13.

24:20.907 --> 24:22.046
Is he telling Karen?

24:22.668 --> 24:23.738
[Da Silva]
Where exactly were you

24:23.807 --> 24:24.980
on Sunday night?

24:25.602 --> 24:27.258
I told you,
he was here all night.

24:27.327 --> 24:29.916
I was at the clinic,
I think, delivering twins.

24:30.399 --> 24:31.746
Any idea what time you got home?

24:31.987 --> 24:33.299
Ten, maybe 11.

24:33.368 --> 24:34.611
Look, I honestly don't know.

24:34.680 --> 24:36.302
[Bennett] So, you saw him
when you got back?

24:36.371 --> 24:37.648
[sighs]

24:37.717 --> 24:40.064
Simon didn't kill Julia Stevens.

24:40.375 --> 24:42.101
And you went straight to bed
with your wife?

24:42.446 --> 24:44.241
Actually, I sleep in
a spare room when I'm late

24:44.310 --> 24:45.173
or on call.

24:46.415 --> 24:47.071
You didn't talk to your kids
or your brother?

24:48.417 --> 24:49.695
[scoffs] I had two
very complicated deliveries,

24:49.764 --> 24:51.041
followed by twins.

24:52.352 --> 24:53.630
The whole day's a blur.

25:00.395 --> 25:02.086
[Da Silva] He reckons
he was at the clinic.

25:02.155 --> 25:04.192
[Bennett] She reckons
he was at home with the kids.

25:04.261 --> 25:05.607
[Da Silva]
Does she know about the assault?

25:05.676 --> 25:06.712
[Bennett] Not a clue.

25:08.679 --> 25:11.268
[suspenseful music playing]

25:14.202 --> 25:15.341
[Simon]
'Cause it is no one's business

25:15.410 --> 25:17.032
but my own, that's why.

25:17.792 --> 25:20.691
But, Simon, I'm your wife.

25:20.898 --> 25:21.899
[bottles clanking]

25:24.868 --> 25:26.628
You told them I was working
Sunday night?

25:27.077 --> 25:30.287
No. You were here, remember?
The Shining?

25:30.494 --> 25:32.289
That was Saturday night, Karen.

25:33.739 --> 25:35.982
Jesus Christ!
Now they'll think I was lying.

25:36.051 --> 25:36.914
Shit.

25:39.089 --> 25:40.884
You've been shoplifting again,
Simon?

25:41.298 --> 25:42.368
Piss off, Ford.

25:46.199 --> 25:47.166
[door slams]

25:51.308 --> 25:52.654
What did they want?

25:53.172 --> 25:55.968
[sighs]
To talk about Julia Stevens.

25:56.520 --> 25:58.177
[Ford] I mean, do they know him?

25:58.246 --> 25:59.868
He wouldn't even murder
a borer bug.

26:00.248 --> 26:01.836
It's not funny, Ford.

26:02.733 --> 26:04.321
They said Julia harassed him

26:04.873 --> 26:07.669
and that Simon has a record
for aggravated assault.

26:09.844 --> 26:10.845
Shit.

26:11.984 --> 26:13.641
Did he really hurt someone?

26:19.992 --> 26:20.958
He was just a kid.

26:22.097 --> 26:23.409
[Ford]
Honestly, it was a lifetime ago.

26:23.478 --> 26:24.928
I want to know what happened.

26:26.930 --> 26:28.448
You should ask him that.

26:28.517 --> 26:30.381
You know what he's like.
I'm asking you.

26:33.039 --> 26:34.869
It was just dumb,
teenage party shit,

26:34.938 --> 26:36.353
nothing out of the ordinary.

26:41.220 --> 26:44.154
A girl got hurt,
and the cops got called.

26:45.189 --> 26:46.777
They took Simon to a boys' home.

26:47.364 --> 26:48.745
A boys' home?

26:50.091 --> 26:51.092
Oh, my God.

26:54.889 --> 26:57.650
-Why wouldn't he tell me that?
-[Ford] It was bad luck, Karen.

26:58.513 --> 27:00.826
He was 13.
It was just an accident.

27:02.897 --> 27:05.106
He's a completely
different person now.

27:14.840 --> 27:16.013
[Ed] It's gone viral.

27:16.358 --> 27:17.808
One hundred thousand views!

27:17.877 --> 27:19.810
[chuckles]

27:20.777 --> 27:23.158
[Roza] What exactly do you
expect me to do about this?

27:23.227 --> 27:25.367
Not give the wonderful world
of social media

27:25.436 --> 27:26.990
quite so much to play with.

27:27.059 --> 27:28.957
You overestimate my power, Ed.

27:29.026 --> 27:30.994
They love you, just not in a way
that's helping us.

27:31.339 --> 27:33.203
I didn't want the cakes
to get wet.

27:33.272 --> 27:35.170
-So, bring out the haters.
-[Ed] It's not just that.

27:35.584 --> 27:38.001
It's the billboard,
the clothes, the whole--

27:38.070 --> 27:39.278
-All the red!
-[Roza] The clothes?

27:39.588 --> 27:41.314
So, what are you,
my stylists now?

27:43.800 --> 27:45.940
Obviously,
we all love your style, Roza.

27:47.148 --> 27:49.184
But Woman's Daycalculated
your outfit as costing

27:49.253 --> 27:51.186
more than 3,000 dollars
the other day.

27:52.049 --> 27:53.361
The blue-collar voters
have trouble with that.

27:53.430 --> 27:54.742
[Ed]
And that's who we're losing.

27:54.811 --> 27:57.020
The thing is we can fix this
image problem very--

27:57.089 --> 27:58.435
Oh, so, you're gonna fix me now?

27:59.298 --> 28:00.368
They're just trying to help.

28:01.818 --> 28:02.681
Well, I'm just trying
not to drink a liter of vodka

28:02.750 --> 28:04.130
and shoot myself in the head.

28:04.199 --> 28:05.718
So, why don't you put that
on your fucking billboards

28:05.787 --> 28:06.961
and see how far it gets you?

28:12.276 --> 28:14.278
Don't worry.
I'll get her over the line.

28:18.869 --> 28:21.113

I'll, uh... I'll catch up.

the gig so far?

-[Da Silva] OC Suspects.
-[Jane chuckles]

28:30.570 --> 28:31.710
-[Da Silva] I'm stoked.
-[Jane] Yeah?

28:32.227 --> 28:34.126
It's a great climate
for moving on up this.

28:34.609 --> 28:36.404
Just knock this one off
as soon as you can, okay?

28:36.611 --> 28:38.061
Don't worry. I'm all over it.

28:38.371 --> 28:40.822
I love the dedication
and so will DI. Gregan.

28:41.478 --> 28:43.066
Anyone looking good for it
so far?

28:43.998 --> 28:44.999
Could be.

28:46.241 --> 28:47.933
I remember that look
from police college.

You've got someone
in your sights?

28:50.590 --> 28:51.488

who left us

30:06.287 --> 30:08.323
with our piece of shit father
and then died.

39:35.131 --> 39:36.201
Can you get that?

39:39.204 --> 39:40.481
Elke!

39:40.550 --> 39:42.828
-[keypad beeps]

39:44.278 --> 39:45.486
[whispers] Come on, answer me.

39:46.729 --> 39:47.764
-[cell phone vibrating]
-...over the water.

39:47.833 --> 39:49.007
-It's beautiful.
-Where did you stay?

39:49.076 --> 39:50.042
You'll have to go.
A place called Milano.

39:53.252 --> 39:55.082
Detective Sergeant
Marie Da Silva.

39:55.151 --> 39:57.049
This is Detective Bennett.
Are your parents home?

39:57.533 --> 39:58.775
No.

39:58.844 --> 40:00.501
Do you mind if we come in
for a quick chat?

40:00.984 --> 40:01.985
Okay.

40:04.332 --> 40:07.508
[cell phone continues vibrating]

40:12.099 --> 40:14.032
-[cell phone ringing]
-Hi.

40:15.205 --> 40:16.241
ls everything all right?

40:16.931 --> 40:17.967
[Ford] Cops are here.

40:19.244 --> 40:21.764
-At the house?
-Yeah, Claire just let them in.

40:22.558 --> 40:23.973
Jesus, they're talking
to the kids?

40:24.352 --> 40:25.802
Si, what's happening?

40:27.217 --> 40:28.529
Just tell me what's happening.
Maybe I can help ya.

40:29.841 --> 40:31.429
I've really fucked up, Ford.

40:32.119 --> 40:33.120
[Ford] How?

40:34.397 --> 40:36.710
Julia Stevens, my alibi,
I've just...

40:38.712 --> 40:39.989
[Simon] I've really fucked up.

40:42.750 --> 40:43.958
What am I gonna do?

40:45.201 --> 40:47.065
[Ford] Relax. We can sort this.

40:52.588 --> 40:53.589
Girls, go to your room.

40:54.141 --> 40:55.798
-Daddy?
-[Karen] To your rooms.

41:01.217 --> 41:02.287
You talked to my kids?

41:03.806 --> 41:05.255
-Lovely girls. Very helpful.
-[Simon] You can't do that.

41:05.324 --> 41:07.050
-This is my fucking family!
-Simon, you're making it worse.

41:08.293 --> 41:09.121
You should listen to your wife,
Dr. Lampton.

41:09.190 --> 41:11.123
Look, it's my fault he's upset.

41:11.434 --> 41:13.885
He was working on Sunday night.
I got it wrong.

41:18.337 --> 41:19.684
We'll go to the cop shop.

41:20.961 --> 41:23.135
We'll make a formal statement.
No big deal.

41:29.038 --> 41:31.178
Okay, let's go.

41:33.283 --> 41:36.252
So, you got home
from work around nine o'clock.

41:37.149 --> 41:38.150
That's right.

41:39.427 --> 41:41.222
The girls were in their rooms,
on their iPads.

41:41.913 --> 41:43.155
I mean, they're never off
the bloody things,

41:43.224 --> 41:44.122
so... [chuckles]

41:45.364 --> 41:45.917
I'd had a hard day.
Ford came and suggested

41:45.986 --> 41:47.021
we go for a run.

41:47.090 --> 41:49.368
He gets wound up
if he doesn't exercise.

41:49.437 --> 41:51.957
I mean like, you know,
he really needs it.

41:52.026 --> 41:53.718
We've done it ever since
we were kids.

41:54.373 --> 41:56.928
We're insomniacs
like our old man, so...

41:58.032 --> 42:00.897
we set off down
St. Stephens Road,

42:01.415 --> 42:03.175
along Brighton Way...

42:04.349 --> 42:05.523
around the Basin.

42:05.592 --> 42:08.180
Along Hobson Walkway,
around the point,

42:08.249 --> 42:10.010
and then up St. Stephens again.

42:10.942 --> 42:12.599
Makes me tired just hearing
about it.

42:13.151 --> 42:14.152
The brother clean?

42:15.222 --> 42:16.050
A couple
of unpaid parking tickets

42:16.119 --> 42:17.258
but otherwise as a whistle.

42:18.466 --> 42:21.642
We went down Parnell Road
into the Domain,

42:22.229 --> 42:24.921
past the ducks and the rotunda.

42:25.301 --> 42:26.820
Home just before 11.

42:27.717 --> 42:29.857
Uh, yeah,
home just before 11.

42:34.966 --> 42:39.280
[ominous music playing]

42:47.288 --> 42:50.360
[distant siren wails]

42:55.469 --> 42:56.608
What do you think?

42:57.195 --> 42:58.610
If he's lying, he's good at it.

43:01.475 --> 43:02.614
He's lying.

43:04.029 --> 43:07.205
[theme music playing]
