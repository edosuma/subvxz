your paper is truly terrible.

- Mr. Venture, you are one

09:38.628 --> 09:43.264

- Well, a-a guy broke in

09:46.302 --> 09:48.269

monster the other day,

09:48.271 --> 09:50.171

guy broke in last night.

a distraction from your studies.

10:20.303 --> 10:22.670

Nice try, but you're not gonna get

18:10.701 --> 18:12.500
very far with that boot on your car.

18:12.502 --> 18:16.304

19:22.806 --> 19:24.606
All right, think guy.

19:24.608 --> 19:26.875
If you're such a super
genius, can you think of a way

19:26.877 --> 19:29.444

19:30.514 --> 19:32.714
Ah, didn't see that
move coming, did you?

We call that an
"in your face checkmate."

19:35.385 --> 19:38.053

20:04.181 --> 20:06.681
Hey, we should totally swing

20:06.683 --> 20:08.783
What? No! We're not
gonna swing anywhere!

20:08.785 --> 20:11.886
