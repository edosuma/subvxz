You wanted to see me?
Yeah, have a seat.

00:05.755 --> 00:07.256
ls it serious?

00:09.426 --> 00:11.969
Wow. Andy's
a little scared.

00:12.053 --> 00:13.178
Okay, right there.

00:14.639 --> 00:16.390
Right there's the problem.

00:16.474 --> 00:18.892
There have been reports
around the office

00:18.977 --> 00:22.521
that you have been
talking baby talk.

00:22.605 --> 00:23.689
Why would people
say that?

00:23.773 --> 00:29.111
Well, l have it
on good authority that
you said the following.

00:29.404 --> 00:30.988
Can you read that
back to me?

00:31.114 --> 00:33.115
"Andy have
a boo-boo tummy."
Mmm-hmm.

00:33.366 --> 00:35.826
Would you rather me say,

00:35.910 --> 00:39.872
"Hey, guys,
my irritable bowel
syndrome is flaring up."

00:39.956 --> 00:42.166
Okay.
"Crazy diarrhea
happening right now."

00:42.250 --> 00:43.959
'Cause things can get
real adult real fast.

00:44.044 --> 00:45.878
You are also on
record as saying,

00:45.962 --> 00:48.172
"Wittle-ittle,
footie-wooties, num-nums,

00:48.256 --> 00:52.134
"jammies, make boom-boom,
widiciwus, and Whode lsland."

00:52.969 --> 00:55.429
Do l sometimes
replace Rs with Ws?

00:55.555 --> 00:57.514
Do l sometimes
repeat a word to get
my point across?

00:57.599 --> 01:00.642
Well, if l do,
Andy's sowwy.

01:00.727 --> 01:03.729
You can't be a baby
in the office.

01:03.813 --> 01:06.440
lt makes me look
like l hire babies.

01:06.524 --> 01:07.608
Well, if we're
complaining,

01:07.692 --> 01:09.610
a lot of people think
your Elvis voice
is annoying.

01:09.694 --> 01:10.861
Okay. Who said that?

01:10.945 --> 01:12.071
Just people.

01:12.155 --> 01:15.115
For the record, l think
it's pretty fantastic.

01:15.200 --> 01:17.242
Thank you.
Thank you a lot.

01:17.869 --> 01:19.953
And for what it's worth,
l think your baby voice
is tops.

01:20.038 --> 01:22.039
Tank you, Mr. Elvis.

01:22.123 --> 01:23.332
You're welcome, baby.

01:48.024 --> 01:50.234
Dr. Tuna M. D. , l have
some terrible news.

01:50.318 --> 01:51.693
Wait, are you the patient
or the doctor?

01:51.778 --> 01:53.570
The entire office
has come down

01:53.655 --> 01:56.323
with a pernicious
case of the Mondays.

01:56.741 --> 01:58.283
Wow. What do you put
our chances at?

01:58.368 --> 01:59.535
0%.

02:00.078 --> 02:04.414
Unless we perform
an immediate emergency
morale transplant, stat!

02:05.208 --> 02:06.250
Sounds risky.

02:06.334 --> 02:08.669
Don't worry.
There is a surefire cure.

02:09.462 --> 02:13.382
Employee of the Month.
Every awesome place
l've worked had one.

02:13.550 --> 02:18.053
Bear Stearns,
Lehman Brothers, AlG,
my summer at Enron.

02:18.888 --> 02:21.098
Wow. That's not
such a bad idea.
Great.

Anything else?
Nope.

"Frankie's Dirty Joke
of the Day."

02:28.273 --> 02:29.857
There's a bunch of those.
Keep.

02:29.941 --> 02:32.484
There's a bunch
of sent emails that
just say "delivered."

02:32.569 --> 02:33.652
Should l delete those?

02:33.736 --> 02:36.155
l want to keep those
so l can see what l sent.

02:36.239 --> 02:37.406
That's why you have
a sent mail folder.

02:37.490 --> 02:38.532
Keep.

02:38.616 --> 02:41.577
There's about
three news alerts
from Nip Slip.

02:41.661 --> 02:43.453
For what?
Nip Slip.

02:43.538 --> 02:45.664
Okay. l don't know
how those get on there.

02:45.748 --> 02:46.748
Well. . .

02:46.875 --> 02:48.542
Must be hackers.

Hey, what's up?

02:51.087 --> 02:54.339
What if l told you
l had done the
worst thing ever?

02:54.424 --> 02:55.757
Would you still want
to be my friend?

02:55.842 --> 02:57.009
Did you murder someone?

02:57.093 --> 02:58.177
Worse than murder.

02:58.261 --> 02:59.428
Oh, my God.

ls that what we're
going for now? "Okay"?

03:11.274 --> 03:12.941
We used to go
for "pretty good."

03:13.026 --> 03:14.067
Great.

03:14.152 --> 03:15.611
Hey, how do you feel
about starting

03:15.695 --> 03:17.112
an Employee of
the Month program?

03:17.197 --> 03:20.574
Yeah. You know what,
that actually might
make me feel better.

03:20.658 --> 03:21.950
l'm not in this for
the trophies, but. . .

03:22.035 --> 03:23.035
You're not in it at all

03:23.119 --> 03:24.995
'cause you can't be
Employee of the Month.
You're a manager.

03:25.079 --> 03:26.580
Well, technically
l am a co-manager

03:26.664 --> 03:28.457
and l barely have
any responsibilities.

03:28.583 --> 03:30.918
All right. Yeah.
But l work hard,
l love this company,

03:31.002 --> 03:33.462
and for those reasons
l think l would make a good
Employee of the Month.

03:33.546 --> 03:34.671
lt would look bad. Sorry.

03:34.756 --> 03:37.132
lt would look good
on my mantle.

03:37.717 --> 03:39.635
Jim's talking to
Michael right now.

03:39.719 --> 03:41.553
They totally
went for our idea!

03:41.638 --> 03:44.181
Yeah ! Your idea.

03:44.307 --> 03:45.515
My idea.

03:45.850 --> 03:47.517
l just need Andy to
think it's his idea

03:47.602 --> 03:50.354
so it won't get
traced back to me.

03:50.897 --> 03:55.317
ln approximately six hours
Jim will get a phone call
from David Wallace.

03:55.860 --> 03:57.194
He will be fired.

03:57.487 --> 04:01.031
Hey, Pam, do you have
a sec to check over
this itinerary?

04:02.242 --> 04:03.242
Looks great.

04:03.326 --> 04:06.203
Did you really look it over?
Felt like maybe you didn't.

04:06.287 --> 04:07.412
Okay.

04:08.665 --> 04:11.750

promise that?

04:36.317 --> 04:37.567
To change lives.

04:37.652 --> 04:40.487
No. Michael,
why would you
promise that?

04:40.571 --> 04:42.197
You know. . .
Okay. l can't. . .

04:42.407 --> 04:44.741
Call the school, cancel.
l can't go through with this.

04:44.826 --> 04:46.702
We've already
rescheduled
seven times.

04:46.786 --> 04:50.330
Michael, this is a terrible,
terrible thing you've done.

04:50.415 --> 04:51.456
Well. . .

04:51.541 --> 04:54.626
lt's terrible.
Just terrible.

04:55.253 --> 04:57.713
And the longer
you put it off,
the worse it's gonna get.

l just. . .
l fell in love
with these kids,

05:00.508 --> 05:03.302
and l didn't want to
see them fall victim
to the system.

05:03.386 --> 05:04.428
So l made them
a promise.

05:04.512 --> 05:07.389
l told them that
if they graduated
from high schooI,

05:07.473 --> 05:10.559
l would pay for their
college education.

05:10.643 --> 05:14.229
l have made some empty
promises in my life,

05:14.314 --> 05:16.857
but hands down,
that was the
most generous.

05:16.983 --> 05:19.151
Just tell me
it is going to be
okay, all right?

05:19.235 --> 05:20.277
No!

05:20.361 --> 05:23.155
l'm not a bad-news person.
l bring good news,

05:23.239 --> 05:25.574
like when l
promised those kids
l'd pay for college.

05:25.658 --> 05:26.658
(LAUGHlNG)

05:26.743 --> 05:29.077
Okay. All right.

05:29.162 --> 05:30.495
You have to tell them.

05:31.414 --> 05:35.334
Would you come with me?
You know, like old times?
lnstead of. . .

05:36.502 --> 05:39.921
l can print out
a new itinerary
with Pam's name on it.

05:40.423 --> 05:42.341
lt's fine.
Erin, you're gonna go,

05:42.425 --> 05:44.301
and you're gonna make sure
Michael tells the truth.

05:44.385 --> 05:47.429
Oh, God. You know what?
Could this day get any worse?

05:48.431 --> 05:51.058
Hey, Jimmy, what's up?

05:51.142 --> 05:52.184
Not much.

05:52.268 --> 05:55.437
Cool. Very cool.
l bet if you tried,

05:55.646 --> 05:59.024
you could grow
the best beard of
anyone in this office.

05:59.108 --> 06:00.275
Thanks, Dwight.

06:00.360 --> 06:01.735
That laugh is
so infectious.

06:01.819 --> 06:04.071
You're creeping me out.
l'm gonna go.

l didn't mean
any of those things
l just said.

06:06.449 --> 06:10.035
And you can expect
the same thing from
everyone in this office

06:10.119 --> 06:13.413
if you don't nip this whole
Employee of the Month
situation in the bud.

06:13.498 --> 06:15.707
Make it about
the work.

06:15.792 --> 06:17.667
Let me guess.
You think you
should get it.

06:18.294 --> 06:21.296
This encompasses
all available data.

06:21.631 --> 06:25.967
Hours, tardiness,
unconfirmed sick days,
participation.

06:26.135 --> 06:28.762
Everyone has been assigned
a random number

06:28.846 --> 06:31.473
for total fairness
and transparency.

06:31.933 --> 06:34.476
Also, this should
be accompanied by
a monetary prize.

ideal world. . .

all 1 0 fingers
on my left hand,

06:38.147 --> 06:40.065

could just be
a fist for punching.

Okay. lf it's all
the same to you,

away survival skills
and self-defense.

l'm gonna run this
by Toby and Accounting

06:46.739 --> 06:48.240

assemble the data.

it would be ideal

if we all pitched in a 20

of the Month thing.
