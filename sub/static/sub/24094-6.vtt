00:10.385 --> 00:11.695
You kissed Olivia?

00:12.846 --> 00:14.514
Damn.

00:14.515 --> 00:15.574
Is it true?

00:17.768 --> 00:20.228
- Yeah.
- You know they boning, right?

00:20.229 --> 00:22.706
Wait. Is he the guy?

00:23.649 --> 00:26.817
This isn't about me. It's about Ruby.
He's in love with Olivia.

00:26.818 --> 00:28.611
- What...
- Can we just all take a moment

00:28.612 --> 00:31.989
to appreciate the fact that, for once,
I was able to keep a secret.

00:31.990 --> 00:33.300
You knew?

00:34.618 --> 00:37.912
- Why would you sell me out like that?
- What do you mean, "Sell you out?"

00:37.913 --> 00:39.372
And you? What type of friend are you?

00:39.373 --> 00:41.707
- Jamal, it's always your fault.
- It's all about his trifling ass.

00:41.708 --> 00:43.876
- What are you saying?
- Bitch, I got a brick in this bag.

00:43.877 --> 00:45.086
You weren't even invited.

00:45.087 --> 00:46.355
Y'all messed up!

00:50.259 --> 00:51.318
We got business.

00:52.886 --> 00:54.279
What about the lockdown?

00:55.764 --> 00:56.764
It's done.

00:58.000 --> 01:04.074

01:07.401 --> 01:09.878
And y'all wanted to kill me.

01:10.487 --> 01:11.922
Shame.

01:13.490 --> 01:15.258
Bitch, that's my cue!

01:18.161 --> 01:20.305
To think I made you
partner in my company.

01:24.418 --> 01:26.478
God damn, that egg sandwich!

01:26.795 --> 01:28.397
How the hell is this my fault?

01:30.716 --> 01:33.884
They're always telling me to keep
my mouth shut, so I shut my mouth,

01:33.885 --> 01:35.278
and now it's on me!

01:38.098 --> 01:40.450
Baby, I just heard about the lockdown!

01:41.101 --> 01:43.102
- A bomb went off.
- A bomb?

01:43.103 --> 01:45.009
Yeah, but I wasn't the
one who dropped it.

01:45.010 --> 01:46.731
It was a metaphorical bomb, but real.

01:46.732 --> 01:47.648
Very real.

01:47.649 --> 01:49.650
I'm still picking out
the emotional shrapnel,

01:49.651 --> 01:52.921
and I... I will never, ever forget
the smell of that sulfur.

01:53.530 --> 01:57.408
I think I might have PTSD.
People Telling Me Secrets Disorder.

01:57.409 --> 01:59.785
- The "Me" is silent.
- But you're seeing okay?

01:59.786 --> 02:01.662
Yeah. My eyes are fine.

02:01.663 --> 02:04.790
In fact, for the first time,
my eyes are wide open.

02:04.791 --> 02:07.001
I've never seen better
than I'm seeing today.

02:07.002 --> 02:08.461
I'm woke AF.

02:08.461 --> 02:12.023
- Don't be cussing in my house.
- Sorry, but the struggle is real.

02:12.883 --> 02:14.925
You're 14. What struggle?

02:14.926 --> 02:16.528
FIMS, Ma. FIMS!

02:17.304 --> 02:20.848
Foot in Mouth Syndrome.
When I say something, I'm screwed.

02:20.849 --> 02:22.350
When I don't say something, I'm screwed.

02:22.351 --> 02:25.871
It's like no matter what I do, I can't
figure out how to unscrew myself.

02:26.480 --> 02:28.540
Baby, you're looking
at the glass half-empty.

02:29.483 --> 02:32.294
But you're seeing okay,
and your eyepatch is off.

02:32.569 --> 02:34.045
That means you must be playing.

02:36.990 --> 02:38.592
You're playing tomorrow?

02:39.034 --> 02:39.950
Mom, no.

02:39.951 --> 02:42.912
- Dwayne! Jamal is playing tomorrow!
- Mom.

02:42.913 --> 02:45.223
- Dwayne!
- Damn it! I did it again.

02:54.633 --> 02:56.151
Dude, we need to talk.

02:56.551 --> 02:58.803
I have nothing to say, Judas.

02:58.804 --> 03:00.642
Technically, Monse
sold you out, so she'd

03:00.643 --> 03:02.515
be Judas. I'm just the
keeper of secrets,

03:02.516 --> 03:04.558
- like the Vatican.
- No wonder I feel violated.

03:04.559 --> 03:06.427
Look, I need you. I may
have inadvertently

03:06.428 --> 03:07.770
signed my own death warrant.

03:08.647 --> 03:09.748
Pray tell?

03:10.065 --> 03:11.649
I had a FIMS flare-up last night

03:11.650 --> 03:14.193
and might've told my mom
I'm playing in the game today.

03:14.194 --> 03:16.195
You told your mom
you're playing in the game?

03:16.196 --> 03:18.072
The game that's getting us
into the playoffs?

03:18.073 --> 03:21.492
- Wait, we made it to the playoffs?
- If we win. You didn't know?

03:22.828 --> 03:26.539
Dude, it's not funny.
Look, I need your help.

03:26.540 --> 03:27.915
I need you to talk to Coach

03:27.916 --> 03:30.393
and convince him
to let me suit up and sit on the bench.

03:33.338 --> 03:35.715
Hilarious. I know.

03:35.716 --> 03:37.943
But you... you... you are the master.

03:38.218 --> 03:40.302
You are the wizard of words.

03:40.303 --> 03:42.805
You can take any bad situation
and make it better.

03:42.806 --> 03:44.640
You... are... Ruben!

03:44.641 --> 03:49.353
Yeah, you're right. I did get Cesar
promoted and I wasn't even trying.

03:49.354 --> 03:52.123
I also got Ms. Castillo
a tax credit on her fake boobs.

03:52.566 --> 03:53.959
- So, you'll do it?
- Hell no!

03:56.611 --> 03:58.129
You got two options.

03:58.363 --> 04:02.843
Either come clean to your folks
or come clean to your folks.

04:03.076 --> 04:04.469
Karma's a bitch, dude.

04:09.332 --> 04:13.603
So... the truth is...

04:15.797 --> 04:16.815
I lied.

04:19.176 --> 04:21.111
I've been lying for months now and...

04:22.471 --> 04:23.780
I know I was wrong...

04:24.765 --> 04:26.825
and you're probably disappointed in me.

04:29.227 --> 04:30.370
But there it is.

04:32.981 --> 04:34.624
I throw myself at your mercy.

04:37.486 --> 04:39.820
Would it help if I told you I loved you?

04:39.821 --> 04:40.821
No.

04:41.823 --> 04:44.676
I don't even let the water boy
sit on my bench.

04:48.789 --> 04:51.957
Did I miss something?
When were you guys cool with each other?

04:51.958 --> 04:54.436
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- Yeah, we're cool.

04:57.172 --> 04:58.172
Interesting.

04:59.049 --> 05:00.108
Hmm.

05:06.598 --> 05:08.849
- You chilly?
- Not really.

05:08.850 --> 05:11.119
Just thought it might be cool
under all that shade.

05:31.498 --> 05:33.892
Oh, I didn't know there was pie.

05:34.751 --> 05:36.752
- Cesar took the last piece.
- Yeah.

05:36.753 --> 05:38.980
Cesar can't keep his hands
off other people's pie.

05:46.221 --> 05:47.364
Happy?

05:48.765 --> 05:51.058
- I don't want your sloppy seconds.
- I barely touched it.

05:51.059 --> 05:52.285
Liar.

05:53.228 --> 05:54.913
I'm done. Turns out I've had my fill.

05:58.441 --> 06:01.086
You should have it.
It might fill that big mouth.

06:08.326 --> 06:09.326
Am I the pie?

06:10.870 --> 06:14.099
- It's complicated. We're dysfunctional.
- Understatement.

06:15.333 --> 06:16.559
Talk later?

06:21.339 --> 06:22.649
Stay?

06:26.761 --> 06:28.971
- Aren't you mad at me?
- Why would I be mad?

06:28.972 --> 06:30.323
That's the trend around here.

06:30.890 --> 06:33.225
All right, you're still new,
so spoiler alert...

06:37.564 --> 06:39.898
Can you please break
down what's going on

06:39.899 --> 06:42.151
'cause shit's getting real weird
and I need the Cliffs Notes?

06:42.152 --> 06:43.360
Where do I begin?

06:43.361 --> 06:48.407
So, it's like this:
our friends are like a family,

06:48.408 --> 06:49.928
if your family was full of pedophiles.

06:50.160 --> 06:52.161
So like, you love your kids,

06:52.162 --> 06:55.331
and your kids have kids
and you love those kids.

06:55.332 --> 06:57.791
And your kids love their kids,
but maybe a little too much

06:57.792 --> 06:59.251
'cause someone's touching the kids.

06:59.252 --> 07:00.961
And you know who's touching the kids.

07:00.962 --> 07:03.505
And you can't say anything
because you love them and they love you.

07:03.506 --> 07:05.132
And it's all messed up
and always your fault.

07:05.133 --> 07:07.426
And you never get any of the love.

07:07.427 --> 07:09.970
Which is probs okay,
'cause you don't want to be diddled.

07:09.971 --> 07:12.115
And this is a terrible metaphor.

07:15.727 --> 07:18.062
Jamal, do you need help?

07:18.063 --> 07:21.041
Yes! But not in that way.

07:21.358 --> 07:24.234
Sorry. I'm only going off the rails
today 'cause I have to play football.

07:24.235 --> 07:26.779
- I didn't even know you were on the team!
- Hence my dilemma, so...

07:26.780 --> 07:31.301
now I have to figure out how to get
in the game, but not play in the game.

07:31.910 --> 07:34.971
Can I ask you a question?
It's potentially sensitive.

07:35.330 --> 07:37.348
Does it have anything
to do with a secret?

07:38.375 --> 07:39.667
- No.
- Hit me.

07:39.668 --> 07:44.046
Okay. I understand why Ruby
would be upset about my kiss with Cesar,

07:44.047 --> 07:45.005
but why Monse?

07:45.006 --> 07:45.965
Huh.

07:45.966 --> 07:48.133
Monse is Monse.
There's no rhyme or reason to her crazy.

07:48.134 --> 07:50.761
Unless there's some truth
to what Jasmine said.

07:50.762 --> 07:51.679
Which would make sense,

07:51.680 --> 07:53.639
because Monse mentioned
she hooked up with a guy over summer...

07:53.640 --> 07:57.101
Stop! Ooh! Red light. Safe word.

07:57.102 --> 07:59.561
This is starting to sound like a secret.
Please don't tell me.

07:59.562 --> 08:02.290
- I don't think it's a secret.
- Okay.

08:02.732 --> 08:04.000
Maybe it's a secret.

08:05.068 --> 08:08.028
You know, it's probably a secret.

08:08.029 --> 08:11.073
Christ on a cracker, woman.
I just told you not to tell me.

08:13.368 --> 08:14.636
A secret.

08:17.205 --> 08:18.122
You have a what?

08:18.123 --> 08:19.349
I have a secret.

08:20.041 --> 08:23.627
- And it came from Olivia.
- What is it?

08:23.628 --> 08:26.505
- What are you gonna do for it?
- Nothing!

08:26.506 --> 08:29.425
Because you owe it to me to tell
me a secret to replace the secret

08:29.426 --> 08:31.552
that you didn't tell me
in the first place.

08:31.553 --> 08:34.888
No. This is too juicy.
I would need something in exchange.

08:34.889 --> 08:37.224
Something only Ruben can offer.

08:37.225 --> 08:39.910
- I'm not talking to the coach.
- Then you'll be secret-less twice.

08:40.270 --> 08:41.227
Was it about me?

08:41.229 --> 08:42.770
Ha.

08:42.772 --> 08:43.856
Good day.

08:46.443 --> 08:48.545
Information manipulation theory.

08:49.654 --> 08:50.863
Pray tell.

08:50.864 --> 08:54.158
Basically, when I talk to the coach, I'm
going to confuse the crap out of him.

08:54.159 --> 08:58.263
Now, I think there's some tea
that needs to be spilled. Spill it.

09:00.457 --> 09:07.105
What if... Cesar really is
cherry-bombing Monse?

09:08.214 --> 09:09.381
Boom!

09:09.382 --> 09:12.051
That's it? Jamal, that's not a secret.
That's a question.

09:12.052 --> 09:15.054
Oh, oh, oh. I forgot the other part.
The other part is.

09:15.055 --> 09:19.933
Monse told Olivia that she was
hooking up with a dude this summer.

09:19.934 --> 09:22.478
So? She went to camp.
It probably happened there.

09:22.479 --> 09:26.023
Or... she boned Cesar before she went,

09:26.024 --> 09:28.609
which is why he said what he said
in the first place.

09:28.610 --> 09:30.527
And girls get
emotionally clingy post-coital,

09:30.528 --> 09:33.572
which would explain why she still wanted
to be friends with him

09:33.573 --> 09:35.407
even after he said what he said

09:35.408 --> 09:39.536
and why she's so upset about his
kiss with Olivia now.

09:39.537 --> 09:42.557
Coincidence? I think not.

09:43.249 --> 09:46.853
Monse is a lot of things,
but she's not a liar.

09:47.128 --> 09:49.922
Do you know how hard
it must have been for her to admit to me

09:49.923 --> 09:52.483
- I was her first kiss in seventh grade?
- She told me the same.

09:53.176 --> 09:54.676
In the sixth grade.

09:55.845 --> 09:56.845
I feel so dirty.

09:57.263 --> 09:59.032
We both feel so dirty.

09:59.349 --> 10:03.828
Damn. Now we got to roll up our sleeves
and get dirtier.

10:07.482 --> 10:09.209
Have you no shame?

10:09.567 --> 10:11.068
What are you talking about?

10:11.069 --> 10:13.779
You are a black man.

10:13.780 --> 10:17.116
And isn't it true, good sir,
that you have a moral obligation

10:17.117 --> 10:21.286
to see to it that this young black man
is afforded the same liberties

10:21.287 --> 10:24.623
- as other black men in this school?
- What? He quit the team!

10:24.624 --> 10:27.918
Yes, but did you ever ask yourself
why he quit the team?

10:27.919 --> 10:29.896
- Don't care.
- And why not?

10:30.380 --> 10:33.549
Isn't it your responsibility
as a leader on this campus,

10:33.550 --> 10:35.968
as a leader within the community,

10:35.969 --> 10:38.470
to wonder why someone
with so much potential

10:38.471 --> 10:40.615
would quit the team?

10:41.224 --> 10:43.600
So, he was reaching out to you,

10:43.601 --> 10:47.437
pleading for you
to take notice of him and his pain.

10:47.438 --> 10:49.523
- And you did nothing.
- Nothing.

10:49.524 --> 10:50.875
- Nothing.
- No, he didn't!

10:51.192 --> 10:53.485
You did what the rest
of society has done

10:53.486 --> 10:56.238
to every other brother
who has come before him.

10:56.239 --> 11:00.409
You turned your back.
You closed the store. You shut the door.

11:00.410 --> 11:01.577
Slammed it!

11:01.578 --> 11:03.537
- You left him to run amok.
- Amok!

11:03.538 --> 11:04.913
- Bamboozled.
- Bamboozled!

11:04.914 --> 11:06.039
- Hoodwinked.
- Hoodwinked!

11:06.040 --> 11:09.668
And led astray to become yet another
statistic on the streets of LA.

11:09.669 --> 11:13.523
All he asks is just to get off
the streets and onto your bench.

11:13.882 --> 11:16.049
- To give him sanctuary.
- Sanctuary.

11:16.050 --> 11:17.050
- Safety.
- Safety.

11:18.553 --> 11:20.012
'Cause I have a dream,

11:20.013 --> 11:24.308
that one day, you will ask
not what Jamal can do for you,

11:24.309 --> 11:27.102
- but what you can do for Jamal.
- Hallelujah!

11:27.103 --> 11:31.815
Because if the helmet fits,
you must let him sit!

11:31.816 --> 11:37.005
If I say yes, will you finally shut up
and get out of my office?

11:37.822 --> 11:39.549
I need to consult with my client.

11:41.200 --> 11:42.385
What are you thinking?

11:44.621 --> 11:45.680
We accept.

11:52.962 --> 11:56.089
- What's going on?
- You said we would talk.

11:56.090 --> 11:58.800
Privately. As in sans the Santo.

11:58.801 --> 12:01.470
It's cool. You all do your girl thing.
I'm gonna bounce.

12:01.471 --> 12:03.490
But then you're gonna miss
seeing Jamal in the game.

12:03.514 --> 12:04.514
- Jamal?
- Jamal?

12:06.351 --> 12:07.976
Told you Jamal's on the field.

12:07.977 --> 12:09.895
How and why is this happening?

12:09.896 --> 12:12.272
Me. Me is why this is happening.

12:12.273 --> 12:14.107
Ruben made a special appearance
in the coach's office

12:14.108 --> 12:16.193
- and got Jamal on the team.
- For what reason?

12:16.194 --> 12:19.321
Isn't this exciting? Aren't you excited?

12:19.322 --> 12:23.158
Yeah! Excited. Stunned. Surprised.

12:23.159 --> 12:26.161
It's been a long time coming after
that record-breaking run of injuries.

12:26.162 --> 12:28.705
I know. I thought we'd have
to put that boy in a bubble.

12:31.334 --> 12:32.435
You still might.

12:39.092 --> 12:42.719
- Come on! Go! Go! Come on!
- Go! Go! Whoo!

12:42.720 --> 12:43.804
Whoo!

12:43.805 --> 12:46.056
We're almost there guys.
Almost home free.

12:46.057 --> 12:48.517
Yes! Yes! Yes, I like that.

12:48.518 --> 12:52.646
Twenty-two! Twenty-two! Put in 22!

12:52.647 --> 12:55.124
Oh, you heard the lady. Put me in.

12:55.775 --> 12:57.960
No, no, no. Don't actually.
Don't actually put me in.

12:58.903 --> 13:02.548
They saving me, Ma! They don't want
none of this Turner Classic.

13:08.579 --> 13:10.139
So petty.

13:10.957 --> 13:12.100
What's petty?

13:12.875 --> 13:14.001
Oh.

13:14.002 --> 13:15.669
So, now you're talking to me?

13:15.670 --> 13:18.296
We've been sitting here four quarters,
you haven't said a word.

13:18.297 --> 13:21.818
Like, "Hello. How was your day?
Your hair is looking immaculate."

13:22.593 --> 13:24.261
- Or, "I'm sorry."
- I'm sorry.

13:24.262 --> 13:27.764
- Really? That's how you're gonna do it?
- Well, I was waiting to do it one-on-one.

13:27.765 --> 13:30.851
So your apologies are like your
betrayals. Stealth and untimely.

13:30.852 --> 13:33.520
Hey, you guys want soda, candy?
It's on me.

13:33.521 --> 13:34.479
- Nope.
- Nope.

13:34.480 --> 13:36.690
Come on, Ruby. Can we not do this?

13:36.691 --> 13:39.043
Not do what? Cat got your tongue?

13:39.527 --> 13:41.153
Or was it Olivia?

13:42.280 --> 13:43.655
That call was bullshit!

13:43.656 --> 13:45.490
- Boo!
- Boo!

13:45.491 --> 13:46.950
- Come on!
- Shame on you!

13:46.951 --> 13:48.910
The ref is clearly biased.
That call was bullshit.

13:48.911 --> 13:51.496
Bad ref!

13:54.917 --> 13:58.503
Nice. Nice work, amigo. You got me.

13:58.504 --> 14:00.815
...on the 36 yard line.

14:02.091 --> 14:04.360
Excuse you. Why are you scooching?

14:04.886 --> 14:06.553
I'm the injured party here.

14:06.554 --> 14:08.472
I was just trying to protect you.

14:08.473 --> 14:10.974
Really? Is that what that was?

14:10.975 --> 14:13.810
'Cause I wasn't aware throwing your
friend under the bus was protection.

14:13.811 --> 14:15.937
- Trust me. It was for your benefit.
- Or yours.

14:15.938 --> 14:19.191
That bus was meant for you
and you pushed me in front of it.

14:19.192 --> 14:21.818
Fight! Fight! Yeah!

14:21.819 --> 14:24.154
- Fight!
- Break it up!

14:24.155 --> 14:25.339
What bus?

14:25.907 --> 14:27.407
The bus of truth.

14:27.408 --> 14:29.993
'Cause I'm starting to question
whether that rumor you suggested

14:29.994 --> 14:33.556
was just a rumor this summer
really wasn't just a rumor after all.

14:33.873 --> 14:36.291
- Fake news.
- I have it on good authority

14:36.292 --> 14:37.959
that you had a summer smash sitch.

14:37.960 --> 14:41.731
And when you put two and two together,
it equals Cesar.

14:45.259 --> 14:46.760
You're out of here! All of you!

14:46.761 --> 14:49.054
Come on! Come on!

14:49.055 --> 14:50.406
That's my whole lineup!

14:51.057 --> 14:53.117
You can't eject my entire lineup!

14:53.726 --> 14:54.911
Johnson, you're in.

14:55.353 --> 14:57.604
Carter, get on the field. Nuñez...

14:57.605 --> 14:59.582
- Which one?
- Both of you! Come on.

14:59.941 --> 15:02.168
Turner! Turner!

15:02.610 --> 15:05.463
No, God. No, God, if you're listening...

15:07.824 --> 15:10.092
Time for the Turner Classic. Let's go!

15:11.869 --> 15:13.370
Be aggressive!

15:13.371 --> 15:15.973
It's time for the Turner Classic!

15:16.374 --> 15:19.167
Your silence is your tell.
Now I know you lied.

15:19.168 --> 15:21.211
- You're a liar and a puta.
- Go to hell, Ruby!

15:21.212 --> 15:23.380
The game is almost over.
Let's talk this out after.

15:23.381 --> 15:24.899
I can't wait that long.

15:25.550 --> 15:27.944
You don't get to walk away.
I get to walk away.

15:28.594 --> 15:30.220
Okay, maybe figure this out now.

15:30.221 --> 15:33.140
There's nothing to figure out.
Monse and Cesar are backstabbing liars.

15:33.141 --> 15:34.933
- Dude, drop it!
- Look! They're putting Jamal in the game!

15:34.934 --> 15:37.936
If I don't? What're you gonna do, homes?
Put a green light out on me?

15:37.937 --> 15:39.163
No, but I'll put you on pause.

15:39.164 --> 15:41.106
I'm gonna watch.
Maybe even get in on it.

15:41.107 --> 15:42.107
Enough!

15:42.108 --> 15:43.942
You're acting like a bunch of kids.

15:43.943 --> 15:47.672
If someone says one more thing,
I'm going to punch them.

15:48.030 --> 15:51.133
All of you, behind the bleachers. Now!

15:53.744 --> 15:58.540
Look, despite what may or may not
have happened, you love each other.

15:58.541 --> 16:01.852
You are each other's family.
And now you've become my family.

16:02.170 --> 16:05.672
So, whether or not you want
to work this out, you need to,

16:05.673 --> 16:08.592
because every day
that you have together is precious.

16:08.593 --> 16:10.677
Trust me. I know.

16:10.678 --> 16:14.514
So, I'm sorry. This is my fault.
I'm the one that kissed Cesar.

16:14.515 --> 16:17.893
So, if you're gonna be mad at anyone...
be mad at me.

16:17.894 --> 16:22.230
Stop. You don't have to be sorry.
And no one is mad at you.

16:22.231 --> 16:25.066
I had no idea one kiss
would cause so much damage.

16:25.067 --> 16:28.588
This isn't on you. It's on me.
I've been lying to everyone.

16:31.407 --> 16:32.758
And I need to come clean.

16:34.577 --> 16:38.205
Huddle up. All right, fourth down, boys.
This one's for the playoffs.

16:38.206 --> 16:41.041
It's do or die time.
We score or we're done.

16:41.042 --> 16:42.977
- You don't have to do this.
- I do.

16:44.879 --> 16:46.147
So, here's the truth.

16:46.756 --> 16:48.190
I was into Cesar.

16:48.758 --> 16:51.360
I had a big crush on him.
And before I went to my writing camp...

16:53.346 --> 16:55.406
I... I told him.

16:57.350 --> 16:59.452
And he didn't feel the same way.

17:00.603 --> 17:02.062
- Say no more.
- We get it.

17:02.063 --> 17:03.855
You don't, so let me make it clear.

17:03.856 --> 17:06.398
After I told Cesar how I felt,
I bounced for the summer.

17:06.400 --> 17:08.818
And Cesar told Oscar's homies
that we smashed to protect me.

17:08.819 --> 17:11.655
He claimed me to keep me safe.
But that's it, that's all.

17:11.656 --> 17:12.614
Nothing ever happened.

17:12.615 --> 17:14.241
- 'Cause he's not into me.
- Monse...

17:14.242 --> 17:15.843
Not like I was into him.

17:17.369 --> 17:20.789
And I'm sorry that I didn't tell you
and that I blurted out that you kissed.

17:20.790 --> 17:22.832
I was jealous and I reacted badly.

17:22.833 --> 17:24.709
But it was fleeting, and it's over.

17:24.710 --> 17:27.628
So, can we move on?
Can I stop embarrassing myself?

17:27.630 --> 17:30.816
'Cause this hole that I've dug
is starting to feel pretty deep.

17:39.934 --> 17:43.496
Heads up, secondary. Hike!

17:56.033 --> 17:57.510
Sorry I called you a puta.

17:58.160 --> 18:00.179
Appreciate that, pendejo.

18:03.499 --> 18:04.600
You're amazing.

18:05.501 --> 18:06.644
No, you are.

18:12.633 --> 18:14.402
What the hell's going on out there?

18:17.388 --> 18:20.149
I don't want to die! I don't
want to die! I don't want to die!

18:20.975 --> 18:23.411
Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh!

18:33.613 --> 18:34.863
Yes! Yeah!

18:36.282 --> 18:38.217
My baby! My baby!

18:45.541 --> 18:48.960
All fall down! All fall down!

18:48.961 --> 18:51.981
All fall down! All fall down!

18:58.054 --> 19:00.221
- Yeah, Jamal!
- Jamal!

19:00.222 --> 19:02.908
- Yes, baby. Yes!
- Yes!

19:11.692 --> 19:13.294
I know. Can you believe Jamal?

19:13.611 --> 19:14.795
Oh, that was insane.

19:16.238 --> 19:18.365
Your feelings aren't one-sided.
You could've told the truth.

19:18.366 --> 19:20.241
- You didn't have to do that.
- No way.

19:20.242 --> 19:22.160
You saw how one kiss
blew up the whole crew.

19:22.161 --> 19:24.162
It was a kiss. One stupid kiss.

19:24.163 --> 19:26.873
- Yeah, a kiss that didn't mean anything.
- Or maybe it did.

19:26.874 --> 19:28.809
- It didn't.
- Then why did you kiss her?

19:30.586 --> 19:32.087
We're not meant to be
more than friends, Cesar.

19:32.088 --> 19:34.464
No, all I have to do is be honest
and explain why you couldn't.

19:34.465 --> 19:36.925
Then they'll know the summer rumor
was true and I lied.

19:36.926 --> 19:39.219
Then just come clean. I don't understand
why you can't just do that.

19:39.220 --> 19:42.847
'Cause you're not a girl. For you,
screwing me gives you street cred.

19:42.848 --> 19:45.100
- For me, screwing you makes me a whore.
- Not if we're together.

19:45.101 --> 19:47.811
No! Then I'm just your bitch.
And you're only with me for one reason.

19:47.812 --> 19:49.872
But I want to be with you, Monse.

19:50.523 --> 19:54.335
- I want to be with you too, but I can't.
- Why?

19:54.985 --> 19:58.154
Because Olivia's right, we're a family.
And if we're together,

19:58.155 --> 19:59.924
- it might break the family up.
- It won't.

20:00.491 --> 20:02.802
Do you know that? For sure?

20:04.662 --> 20:05.679
Exactly.

20:06.414 --> 20:07.681
So what are you saying?

20:09.166 --> 20:10.226
I'm saying...

20:12.211 --> 20:13.729
I'm good at being your friend.

20:14.296 --> 20:15.564
So, I should do that.

20:16.173 --> 20:18.341
And Olivia likes you, and I like her.

20:18.342 --> 20:20.569
So, you should do that.

20:46.412 --> 20:49.205
- Way to play.
- Thanks, man. Thank you.

20:49.206 --> 20:50.432
- Hey.
- All right, brother.

20:51.208 --> 20:52.375
Where you all going?

20:52.376 --> 20:53.644
Out of here. Come on.

20:55.087 --> 20:57.756
Nice game, homie.
You made the 'Ridge proud.

20:57.757 --> 20:59.275
You need anything, I got you.

21:02.261 --> 21:04.029
- Lil' Ricky.
- What?

21:07.057 --> 21:08.057
Lil' Ricky.

21:08.350 --> 21:10.828
- What about him?
- Where can I find him?

21:11.270 --> 21:14.105
- What do you want with Lil' Ricky?
- You know, converse.

21:14.106 --> 21:16.858
Chat. Chew the fat. Please?

21:16.859 --> 21:18.085
I see you, homie.

21:19.528 --> 21:21.029
1400 Forest Lawn Drive.

21:21.030 --> 21:23.406
1400 Forest Lawn Drive.
1400 Forest Lawn Drive.

21:23.407 --> 21:25.509
- Tell him Spooky said, "What up."
- Okay.

21:29.663 --> 21:31.956
1400 Forest Lawn Drive.
1400 Forest Lawn Drive.

21:31.957 --> 21:33.917
1400 Forest Lawn Drive.

21:33.918 --> 21:36.562
1400 Forest Lawn Drive.
1400 Forest Lawn Drive.

21:46.514 --> 21:47.698
Dad?

21:48.182 --> 21:50.618
- When did you get home?
- I just got off the road.

21:51.519 --> 21:53.162
Why are you in the dark?

21:57.483 --> 21:58.483
You okay, baby?

22:00.152 --> 22:02.254
- Do I need to kick someone's ass?
- No.

22:03.322 --> 22:04.798
It's just stupid teenage stuff.

22:08.285 --> 22:11.764
I was a teenager once.
Not that long ago.

22:13.249 --> 22:15.434
Nothing's stupid if it's making you cry.

22:16.335 --> 22:19.170
It'll pass. These things always do.

22:19.171 --> 22:21.941
See, there you go again,
doing my job for me.

22:25.386 --> 22:27.696
Hey. Hey. Hey.

22:32.518 --> 22:33.661
I love you, baby.

22:34.061 --> 22:36.288
You're the best thing
that's ever happened to me.

22:41.652 --> 22:42.961
I love you too, Dad.

22:46.782 --> 22:48.300
Do you ever think about Mom?

22:52.121 --> 22:53.222
Of course.

22:54.415 --> 22:56.100
Especially in moments like this.

22:57.459 --> 22:58.501
Why?

22:58.502 --> 23:00.979
Because she doesn't know
how incredible you are.

23:02.381 --> 23:03.440
Or you.

23:04.967 --> 23:06.402
Where do you think she is?

23:08.304 --> 23:09.321
I don't know.

23:10.389 --> 23:11.782
Last I heard, New York.

23:34.747 --> 23:35.764
Are you good?

23:36.498 --> 23:37.498
Yeah.

23:38.709 --> 23:40.084
Are we good?

23:40.085 --> 23:42.563
Any weirdness in the
air we should clear?

23:43.047 --> 23:45.023
Nope. Totally clear.

23:45.716 --> 23:48.402
You like Cesar. I'm cool with it.

23:50.554 --> 23:52.197
I never wanted to hurt you.

23:54.058 --> 23:55.058
You're not.

23:55.893 --> 23:56.893
You sure?

24:03.359 --> 24:06.653
You see, there's something called
the long game,

24:06.654 --> 24:07.963
and that's what I'm playing.

24:08.697 --> 24:10.549
So, fly along, baby girl.

24:11.200 --> 24:12.885
You know, test the waters.

24:14.161 --> 24:17.264
Enjoy your Cesar salad, and I mean that.

24:17.956 --> 24:22.853
Because nothing is gonna taste as good
as this Ruben.

24:25.297 --> 24:27.399
And you may not know it yet,

24:28.258 --> 24:30.611
but I'm gonna be the love of your life.

24:33.263 --> 24:34.448
So, good night, my dear.

24:35.557 --> 24:36.700
Sleep well,

24:37.559 --> 24:40.537
and dream about our wedding colors,

24:41.146 --> 24:42.939
'cause I'm down with anything but beige.

24:48.570 --> 24:49.797
Lavender.

24:59.665 --> 25:04.043
- We going free ride. College scholarship.
- We going free ride. Going scholarship.

25:04.044 --> 25:07.463
- We going free ride. College scholarship.
- We going free ride. Going scholarship.

25:07.464 --> 25:11.008
We going to the Super Bowl!

25:14.346 --> 25:16.639
Way to bring it home, baby.

25:16.640 --> 25:18.349
Ooh! You ready for the playoffs?

25:18.350 --> 25:22.663
Ah! Yeah, so excited. Can't wait.
Gonna be epic. I quit the team.

25:25.482 --> 25:26.399
What?

25:26.400 --> 25:30.361
Months ago. And so you wouldn't find out,
I might have faked an injury or two.

25:30.362 --> 25:32.405
Or eight. Today was a total fluke.

25:32.406 --> 25:34.907
Ruby had to Jedi mind-trick the Coach
to let me sit on the bench.

25:34.908 --> 25:37.201
I wasn't supposed to play,
let alone save the game.

25:37.202 --> 25:39.036
I know this is shocking and sudden

25:39.037 --> 25:40.872
and I've decimated
all your hopes and dreams,

25:40.873 --> 25:43.082
but I just can't keep it
bottled up anymore.

25:43.083 --> 25:45.126
My insides were feeling
like Coke and Pop Rocks,

25:45.127 --> 25:46.979
and I don't want to be like Mikey.

25:48.255 --> 25:50.899
So... I'm sorry.

25:53.218 --> 25:55.112
And I throw myself at your mercy.

25:57.181 --> 26:01.660
- So, you don't like football?
- Hate it.

26:08.525 --> 26:09.525
Okay.

26:10.903 --> 26:11.903
Okay?

26:12.613 --> 26:14.798
You just got to do you.

26:16.575 --> 26:17.634
So that's it?

26:18.911 --> 26:20.495
That's all? You don't care?

26:20.496 --> 26:23.223
We're here to support you, baby,
not hurt you.

26:23.582 --> 26:25.082
We want you to find your passion.

26:25.083 --> 26:28.145
And if it's not football,
you know, it's cool.

26:29.046 --> 26:33.275
So, you don't care about football?

26:35.219 --> 26:36.219
All this time...

26:36.762 --> 26:40.365
all these lies, all those medical
devices, and you don't care?

26:41.099 --> 26:42.767
This is really jacked!

26:42.768 --> 26:45.120
We just want you to be happy.

26:47.397 --> 26:50.650
I can't believe you. "Just be happy"?

26:50.651 --> 26:51.752
I need a minute.

26:52.528 --> 26:53.754
Alone.

27:00.744 --> 27:02.662
Yes! Yes! Yes!

27:02.663 --> 27:05.599
Yeah! Yeah!

28:05.017 --> 28:06.451
What's up, Lil' Ricky?

28:07.644 --> 28:08.996
I'm coming for you.

28:09.305 --> 28:15.781
