somebody's been in here.'

'a security gate

and steal your laptops
without appearing

06:56.542 --> 06:58.250

- He had someone on the inside?
- Assume he does.

And what's his only
known connection to Lancer?

07:03.208 --> 07:05.834

He's a booster.

07:05.834 --> 07:06.959
Exactly.

- Bobby Overton.
- Bingo.

That's the obvious answer,
it hardly warrants a bingo.

Well, Eileen in Facilities

07:27.208 --> 07:28.959

07:39.792 --> 07:42.291
Oh.

07:42.291 --> 07:44.750

is that Overton

07:44.750 --> 07:47.250
hasn't given a dime to the
program for over two years

07:47.250 --> 07:50.625

07:58.667 --> 08:01.625
Only Bill Marsh has the power
to reward him like that.

08:03.291 --> 08:05.291
Yeah, but Red Raymond
wasn't at Lancer

08:05.291 --> 08:06.792
'when Travis was convicted.'

08:06.792 --> 08:08.625
I mean, why would he help
maintain a cover-up

08:08.625 --> 08:09.708

08:09.708 --> 08:12.792
- To protect football.
- 'Good point, Mr. Pepper.'

08:12.792 --> 08:14.250

08:18.250 --> 08:22.125
From a legal standpoint,
we got nothing.

08:22.125 --> 08:23.333

08:23.333 --> 08:25.667
That's the only thing
that makes sense.

08:25.667 --> 08:28.500
And Overton paid off Travis'
ex-girlfriend and the pharmacist

08:28.500 --> 08:30.500
'so they'd
change their statements.'

08:30.500 --> 08:33.291
And Marsh rewarded Overton
in return.

08:33.291 --> 08:35.000
A furniture deal
and season tickets

08:35.000 --> 08:36.958
it's not exactly
evidence of a crime.

08:36.958 --> 08:38.917
Maybe you can pay him a visit
and lean on him.

08:38.917 --> 08:40.500
He might panic
and give something up.

08:40.500 --> 08:43.457
Uh-uh, the minute he figures out
that I've taken an interest

08:43.457 --> 08:45.542
he's gonna circle the wagons,
and right now it's better

08:45.542 --> 08:49.166
that he thinks he's up against
Nancy Drew and Harry Potter.

08:49.166 --> 08:51.542
Whoa, whoa. Why does
she get to be Nancy Drew?

08:51.542 --> 08:52.834
Harry Potter's
not even a detective.

08:52.834 --> 08:54.166
Look, you can be
Nancy Drew if you want.

08:54.166 --> 08:55.667
- That is not the point.
- Listen!

08:55.667 --> 08:57.458
Bill Marsh is a powerful man
at this school

08:57.458 --> 08:59.125
and if we're gonna go after him,
I need concrete proof.

08:59.125 --> 09:00.792
How do we get it?

09:00.792 --> 09:03.500
Well, who am I to tell
Nancy Drew how to do her job?

09:06.917 --> 09:10.250
We'll reconnect when
I come back from Washington.

Hey, have you talked to Marti?

09:34.583 --> 09:35.667
She's not answering her phone.

09:35.667 --> 09:38.542
I think she's at the law library
doing some research.

09:38.542 --> 09:39.750
Everything okay?

09:39.750 --> 09:41.542
Yeah, sure. Never better.

09:41.542 --> 09:44.959
Oh, look at this. Baby book.

09:44.959 --> 09:46.750
Did I say you could
go through my stuff?

09:46.750 --> 09:48.041
Anyway, it's not mine.

09:48.041 --> 09:49.750
Oh, you can't fool
a fellow mother.

09:49.750 --> 09:51.875
I can smell it on you.

09:51.875 --> 09:53.959
No, seriously.
It's for my friend.

09:53.959 --> 09:57.792
Is it Marti? Oh, dear Lord.
Okay, I can take it.

09:57.792 --> 10:01.250
Who is the baby daddy?
I mean, is it Lewis?

10:01.250 --> 10:05.417
- Dan? Morgan?
- Okay, it's not Marti.

10:05.417 --> 10:08.166
Ah. Well, now, I'm curious.

10:08.166 --> 10:10.417
Which friend got knocked up?
Alice?

10:10.417 --> 10:13.041
- It's got to be Alice, right?
- It's no one you know.

10:13.041 --> 10:15.625
Well, then I was right
the first time. It is you!

10:15.625 --> 10:18.000
Honey, don't worry about
that mama of yours.

10:18.000 --> 10:19.083
Who said I was worried
about my mom?

10:19.083 --> 10:22.875
Your friends will stand by you.
I will stand by you.

10:22.875 --> 10:25.792
Oh, I will love that baby
like it's my own.

10:25.792 --> 10:27.291
What do you think
of the name Ike?

10:27.291 --> 10:29.792
I think that is
a very strong name for a boy.

10:29.792 --> 10:31.625
Okay, can you please
stop talking?

10:31.625 --> 10:33.625
You sound like Marti
right there.

10:33.625 --> 10:35.041
It's not for me.

10:36.667 --> 10:38.000
It's for my little sister.

10:38.000 --> 10:39.875
Oh, I don't really know her.

10:39.875 --> 10:42.667
You can't tell anyone, okay?
Especially not my mom.

10:42.667 --> 10:45.917
Honey, she's gonna find out.
I mean, come on.

10:45.917 --> 10:47.333
You think I don't know that?

10:47.333 --> 10:51.917
Babies are a joy,
but they are also a nightmare.

10:51.917 --> 10:54.458
I mean, if I, if I didn't have
my mother's help

10:54.458 --> 10:57.458
well, I'd probably would've
ended up on the TV news.

10:57.458 --> 10:59.834
It was really that bad?

10:59.834 --> 11:01.458
What your sister doesn't realize

11:01.458 --> 11:04.834
is that she's gonna need
her mom now more than ever.

11:05.959 --> 11:07.625
My mom is gonna be furious.

11:07.625 --> 11:09.000
She'll get over it.

11:09.000 --> 11:12.500
When she holds that fat baby
in her arms

11:12.500 --> 11:14.291
all will be forgiven

11:14.291 --> 11:17.125
but she needs to tell her.

11:17.125 --> 11:19.000
I know.

11:19.000 --> 11:20.875
What I don't know is how.

11:22.291 --> 11:24.875
Would've been funny
if it was Alice.

11:26.500 --> 11:27.917
Yeah.

11:38.041 --> 11:41.125
Will you stop obsessing
over the stupid NFL draft?

11:41.125 --> 11:43.291
Shane Villano's gonna
go in the first round.

11:43.291 --> 11:45.708
The guy's got an arm
like cooked pasta.

11:45.708 --> 11:50.708
Mm. I prefer mine al dente.

11:50.708 --> 11:51.875
Yeah, if he could go first round

11:51.875 --> 11:54.000
I could go first round, too.

11:58.917 --> 12:01.917
You obviously want to go pro
next year.

12:01.917 --> 12:05.000
Why haven't you declared
for the draft?

12:05.000 --> 12:07.375
Bill Marsh wants me
to stay at Lancer.

12:07.375 --> 12:08.750
He says the team needs me.

12:08.750 --> 12:12.000
Oh, I am so over that jackass.

12:12.000 --> 12:13.542
Just tell him to go to hell.

12:13.542 --> 12:15.166
Yeah, I can't do that.

12:15.166 --> 12:18.000
Why not? You're a free agent.

12:18.000 --> 12:19.834
That's not exactly true.

12:21.000 --> 12:23.000
What do you mean?

12:25.375 --> 12:28.250
Jake? Tell me.

12:30.875 --> 12:34.041
I did this prank freshman year.

12:34.041 --> 12:35.959
Stupid football initiation
thing, it just...

12:35.959 --> 12:38.792
It went really, really wrong.

12:38.792 --> 12:41.208
What kind of thing?

12:41.208 --> 12:43.083
It was bad, okay?
That's all you need to know.

12:43.083 --> 12:44.583
Bill Marsh helped me cover it up

12:44.583 --> 12:47.041
he called in a lot of favors.

12:47.041 --> 12:48.917
When I went in to talk to him
about the draft

12:48.917 --> 12:52.291
he opens up his safe and...

12:54.125 --> 12:56.083
And he kept evidence
to use against me

12:56.083 --> 12:58.041
in case
I ever tried to cross him.

13:01.583 --> 13:03.542
What kind of evidence?

13:07.417 --> 13:09.959
You know what?
Forget I said anything, okay?

13:09.959 --> 13:11.250
I actually care about you, Alice

13:11.250 --> 13:12.917
and I don't want you
anywhere near this.

13:12.917 --> 13:17.125
Oh, Jakey,
don't tell me what to do.

13:17.125 --> 13:18.917

33:04.708 --> 33:06.917
You know, to tell you the truth

33:06.917 --> 33:10.125
I was hurt that you felt
you couldn't come to me.

33:10.125 --> 33:11.792
And you wonder why?

33:11.792 --> 33:14.125
Would it kill you to take
a little bit of responsibility?

33:14.125 --> 33:18.125
- Would it?
- This is not Savannah's fault!

33:18.125 --> 33:20.458
It's mine.

33:20.458 --> 33:22.125
- And it's yours, too.
- Oh, no, no, no.

33:22.125 --> 33:24.375
Don't you dare
try and pin this one on me.

33:24.375 --> 33:28.166
I couldn't tell you
I was pregnant...

33:28.166 --> 33:30.333
...because you scare me.

33:30.333 --> 33:32.792
I thought if I told you,
you would just yell at me

33:32.792 --> 33:34.291
and give me
some lecture on abstinence

33:34.291 --> 33:35.500
and that's exactly what you did.

33:35.500 --> 33:37.000
Well, you should've abstained.

33:37.000 --> 33:39.667
- Yeah, but I didn't!
- That was your choice.

33:39.667 --> 33:41.333
Because you raised me wrong.

33:41.333 --> 33:43.000
You raised me
in some stupid bubble

33:43.000 --> 33:45.000
that has nothing to do with
the way the world really works!

33:45.000 --> 33:47.000
Alright, that's it.
You go to your room!

33:47.000 --> 33:48.166
(Charlotte)
Oh, what are you gonna do?
Ground me?

33:48.166 --> 33:50.333
I hope the OB/GYN
makes house calls.

33:50.333 --> 33:52.792
- She is pregnant, Lane.
- Oh, hush, Parker!

33:52.792 --> 33:54.333
Oh, don't tell me to hush!

33:54.333 --> 33:56.000
- You are a terrible mother!
- 'I've had enough of this.'

33:56.000 --> 33:58.333
How dare you tell
I'm a terrible mother?

33:58.333 --> 34:00.166
Shut up! Shut up!

34:04.417 --> 34:06.083
This family is a mess.

34:07.333 --> 34:09.125
We don't communicate.

34:09.125 --> 34:11.375
We repress and repress
and we let things fester

34:11.375 --> 34:14.417
until there's a big explosion,
and somebody ends up in tears.

34:16.375 --> 34:19.417
- Well, we are Baptists.
- 'It's gotta stop.'

34:19.417 --> 34:22.417
We've got to open up, talk.

34:22.417 --> 34:24.333
'Stop pointing
the finger at one another'

34:24.333 --> 34:25.500
and start acting like a team.

34:25.500 --> 34:27.542
We are not cheerleaders.

34:27.542 --> 34:29.291
- I am.
- So am I.

34:31.250 --> 34:32.875
And we win
because our squads pull together

34:32.875 --> 34:34.583
when the pressure's on.

34:34.583 --> 34:36.500
It's not about the individual

34:36.500 --> 34:38.667
'it's about something bigger.'

34:38.667 --> 34:40.875
I don't have to listen to this.

34:40.875 --> 34:44.208
Yeah, well, like it or not,
there's a baby on the way

34:44.208 --> 34:46.917
and we control the world
he or she enters.

34:46.917 --> 34:48.708
'Is it going to be
a world where everyone'

34:48.708 --> 34:51.542
yells and fights
and attacks one another?

34:51.542 --> 34:53.417
Or is it gonna be
a world of comfort

34:53.417 --> 34:55.875
and nurturing
and a strong, supportive family?

34:59.458 --> 35:01.291
'We have to choose.'

35:04.083 --> 35:06.708
And we have to choose
right now...

35:06.708 --> 35:09.125
...because the child in there
can hear everything we say.

35:16.417 --> 35:18.708
So what's it gonna be?

35:22.041 --> 35:26.625
I apologize, Charlotte,
for losing my cool

35:26.625 --> 35:29.500
and for making you feel like
you couldn't talk to me.

35:29.500 --> 35:31.208
I never wanted to scare you.

35:33.417 --> 35:34.959
I appreciate that.

35:36.291 --> 35:38.125
And I also want
to apologize to you

35:38.125 --> 35:40.750
because I said
some very ugly things

35:40.750 --> 35:43.291
that you did not deserve.

35:43.291 --> 35:45.500
It's okay, mom.

35:45.500 --> 35:48.166
I can take it.

35:48.166 --> 35:50.583
I know you can. I know.

35:50.583 --> 35:53.542
Oh, I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.

what are you doing here?'

36:10.750 --> 36:13.000
Um, I just needed to get out
of Cheer Town for a bit.

36:13.000 --> 36:14.792
Well, I'd think
you'd all would be flying high.

36:14.792 --> 36:17.500
I heard
you sold all the calendars.

36:17.500 --> 36:19.166
Yeah, thanks.

36:20.542 --> 36:22.583
Something wrong?

36:22.583 --> 36:24.708
Yeah, I'm just, um, preoccupied.

36:28.125 --> 36:29.834
Can I stay at your place
for tonight?

36:32.500 --> 36:34.166
I can't go back to Cheer Town.

36:34.166 --> 36:35.333
Why not?

36:35.333 --> 36:37.000
Well, it's complicated.

36:37.000 --> 36:39.500
I need to ask my professor
about something first.

36:39.500 --> 36:41.333
You can always come home.

36:41.333 --> 36:43.000
You still have your key

36:43.000 --> 36:45.834
and I'll meet you there
when I lock up.

37:08.291 --> 37:10.750
So you were the one
with Marti's laptop all along.

37:13.250 --> 37:14.583
Yeah.

37:16.000 --> 37:19.250
Bobby Overton had me
steal both of them...

37:19.250 --> 37:21.542
'cause we know how close
they were getting...

37:23.000 --> 37:25.208
...who they'd been talking to.

37:27.000 --> 37:28.542
(Jake)
Actually, I kept Marti's

37:28.542 --> 37:30.792
'cause I wanted to copy
her music library.

37:32.500 --> 37:34.208
It's spectacular.

37:38.583 --> 37:42.250
An innocent guy is sitting
in prison because of you.

37:42.250 --> 37:43.250
How could you do that?

37:43.250 --> 37:45.208
We didn't know
that was gonna happen, Alice.

37:45.208 --> 37:48.834
Turns out the pharmacist
was a freaking Lancer fan.

37:48.834 --> 37:50.583
He saw me take the drugs,
he recognized me

37:50.583 --> 37:53.583
contacted Marsh, who got Overton
to do his dirty work

37:53.583 --> 37:56.458
so he could keep
his distance from this.

37:56.458 --> 37:57.917
So Overton saved your ass.

37:57.917 --> 37:59.708
Yeah, I mean,
he paid off the witnesses.

37:59.708 --> 38:02.250
He got the-the pharmacist
to change his witness statement.

the guy made up some fake'

After that things,
they spiraled, okay?

38:13.250 --> 38:16.250
I wanted to come clean,
but I was in too deep.

38:16.250 --> 38:18.291
Bill Marsh had already
gotten people to lie for me.

38:20.625 --> 38:22.375
We had to protect ourselves.

38:22.375 --> 38:24.667
And protect football.

38:24.667 --> 38:26.458
That's the same thing.

38:29.959 --> 38:31.458
Look...

38:33.542 --> 38:35.792
I felt awful about it, okay?

38:35.792 --> 38:40.542
I still feel awful about it,
but...it was out of my control.

38:41.625 --> 38:43.458
You got to believe that.

38:45.083 --> 38:48.125
So you knew an innocent guy
went to prison for you.

38:51.250 --> 38:53.750
Uh...the guy was homeless,
Alice.

38:53.750 --> 38:55.542
At least in prison,
he got three meals a day

Marti figured it out.

She has the DVD of you
stealing the drugs.
