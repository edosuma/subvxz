[groaning]

00:29.029 --> 00:30.697
[hooting]

00:31.865 --> 00:33.908
[laughing]

00:34.617 --> 00:37.203
Richard! What have you done to yourself?

00:37.287 --> 00:39.289
Do you like my new look?

00:39.914 --> 00:44.169
I've evolved
into something much more powerful.

00:44.252 --> 00:46.254
[Kong roaring]

00:46.337 --> 00:49.424
Relax, Kong,
you may as well get used to it here.

00:50.049 --> 00:51.885
Because you aren't going anywhere.

00:51.968 --> 00:53.720

00:55.013 --> 00:57.098

[groans]

00:59.601 --> 01:02.312
[grunting]

01:02.395 --> 01:06.191
Thrash all you like, Kong.
Not even I could break those bars.

01:06.274 --> 01:08.359
[roaring]

01:08.443 --> 01:11.154
I'll deal with you later, primate.

01:11.237 --> 01:15.492
Right now, I need to reprimand Botila
for her betrayal and malice.

01:15.575 --> 01:19.621
[laughs] There she goes.
I'm right behind you, Botila.

01:23.750 --> 01:27.420
-Any sign of Kong, Jonesy?
-I got nothing, Lukas. Sorry.

01:27.504 --> 01:31.132
-I've lost the signal from Botila's ship.
-[sighs] We'll find Kong.

01:31.216 --> 01:33.176
I'm worried
we might not have the firepower

01:33.259 --> 01:35.929
to deal with whoever was powerful enough
to take him down.

01:36.012 --> 01:38.473
[grunting]

01:38.556 --> 01:40.683
What's Apex saying, Danny?

01:40.767 --> 01:42.977
He says he might know
how to even the odds!

01:45.855 --> 01:48.983
Your timing is too impeccable
to be a coincidence.

01:49.067 --> 01:51.694
Taking over my ship at the moment
my clones mutinied

01:51.778 --> 01:53.488
seems extremely convenient.

01:53.571 --> 01:55.156
Oh, Botila.

01:55.240 --> 01:57.784
Are you so naive to think
that I haven't been watching

01:57.867 --> 02:01.079
your every move
since you stole my base?

02:02.288 --> 02:06.000
-[gasps]
-I have hidden cameras everywhere!

02:06.626 --> 02:08.961
Well, that's kind of creepy.

02:09.044 --> 02:13.716
I kept my distance after you displayed
your new ability to control AIs.

02:13.800 --> 02:17.095
Once your rebellious clones
took that power away,

02:17.178 --> 02:20.890
it seemed like the right time
to make my glorious comeback.

02:20.974 --> 02:22.183
[Botila gasps]

02:22.267 --> 02:25.520
And now I'm torn between allowing you
to remain intact long enough...

02:25.603 --> 02:26.604
[Botila straining]

02:26.688 --> 02:30.775
...to witness my revenge on Kong,
or crushing you like a bug.

02:30.859 --> 02:32.735
[grunting]

02:33.444 --> 02:37.866
Twenty thousand volts
says you release me right now, Richard!

02:40.743 --> 02:42.287
That didn't even tickle.

02:47.375 --> 02:49.502
-Wow!
-¡Increíble!

02:49.586 --> 02:50.670
Oh, man!

02:50.753 --> 02:53.172
[grunting]

03:00.388 --> 03:03.349
Whatever you've got planned,
you'll fail, Richard.

03:03.433 --> 03:05.184
You always fail.

03:05.268 --> 03:08.229
[groans] You're even more annoying
than I remember.

03:09.981 --> 03:12.317
I want to show you something.

03:12.400 --> 03:14.319
You're coming too.

03:14.402 --> 03:16.279
[snarling]

03:17.947 --> 03:20.116
[Kong roaring]

03:23.328 --> 03:24.787
I think we should bail.

03:30.877 --> 03:33.212
[Botila] Love what you've done
with the place.

03:33.296 --> 03:34.756
[Richard] You stole my resources

03:34.839 --> 03:37.926
and forced me to create a new lab
out of trash!

03:38.009 --> 03:41.763
But one bot's trash
is another genius' riches.

03:41.846 --> 03:45.391
And this lab is nothing compared
to my ultimate achievement!

03:45.475 --> 03:47.018
Me!

03:47.101 --> 03:50.146
After my setback in Egypt,

03:50.230 --> 03:53.733
I returned here to plan my revenge
on you and my brother

03:53.816 --> 03:57.654
for the many indignities
I suffered at your hands.

03:57.737 --> 04:01.616
You all thought I was finished,
but I will never be beaten.

04:01.699 --> 04:03.076
I had a plan.

04:03.159 --> 04:06.079
I realized the only way to defeat my enemy

04:06.162 --> 04:10.625
was to become like him,
only much, much better!

04:10.708 --> 04:15.171
Now my size truly matches my ambition.

04:15.255 --> 04:17.464
[grunting]

04:17.548 --> 04:18.591
[Jonesy] Seems simple.

04:18.675 --> 04:21.803
This must be the safety,
and this lever controls the... Whoa!

04:21.886 --> 04:23.388
Oh!

04:23.471 --> 04:25.139
[Lukas] Look out!

04:25.223 --> 04:27.225
[groans]

04:27.850 --> 04:29.644
You okay, buddy?

04:29.727 --> 04:31.813
The only thing that's hurt is my pride.

04:32.438 --> 04:34.774
And my butt.
I kind of hurt my butt a little.

04:34.857 --> 04:36.234
-[both giggle]
-Butt.

04:36.317 --> 04:38.736
[grunting]

04:41.447 --> 04:45.243
Uh, he said he's going to show you
how it's done.

Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:54.377 --> 04:55.378
[Danny] Wow!

04:56.004 --> 04:57.797
Okay. I'm impressed.

05:00.300 --> 05:05.013
[grunts] How were you able to transform
yourself into this monstrosity?

05:05.096 --> 05:07.974
Deep within the earth,
there lies an ancient city

05:08.057 --> 05:10.143
filled with advanced apes.

05:10.226 --> 05:13.354
There I discovered a room
lined with stone tablets,

05:13.438 --> 05:16.691
carved with their collective knowledge
and history.

05:16.774 --> 05:19.027
Translating the symbols took time,

05:19.110 --> 05:21.070
but the information they contained

05:21.154 --> 05:24.157
allowed me to take my theories
to the next level.

05:24.240 --> 05:29.245
The secrets of Kong's amazing size
and strength were finally laid bare to me.

05:29.329 --> 05:32.790
Secrets I could now duplicate
and use upon myself!

05:32.874 --> 05:35.084
Using Kong's genetic material,

05:35.168 --> 05:38.671
which he unknowingly provided
during our underground adventure,

05:38.755 --> 05:42.425
I was able to enhance
my body's cellular structure.

05:42.508 --> 05:45.470
Making me bigger, and more powerful.

05:46.637 --> 05:50.099
Until I was more than a match
for Kong himself!

05:50.725 --> 05:52.769
[yelling]

05:55.396 --> 05:59.650
The harmonic key described
in the elders' ancient texts

05:59.734 --> 06:02.403
allowed me to return
to the subterranean world,

06:02.487 --> 06:07.075
where I easily overcame the ape
and brought him here,

06:07.158 --> 06:10.578
where he will be the cornerstone
of my revenge!

06:10.661 --> 06:12.663
[laughs]

06:14.665 --> 06:17.502
I've picked up Kong's signal.
He's back on Kong Island!

06:17.585 --> 06:20.546
There can only be one reason
anyone would reactivate it.

06:20.630 --> 06:24.967
Yeah. Whoever took Kong
wants us to follow him into a trap.

06:25.051 --> 06:26.844
Yeah, it's a trap.

06:26.928 --> 06:28.471
It's always a trap.

06:28.554 --> 06:30.181
So let's go, already!

06:30.264 --> 06:31.724
[all laugh]

06:35.603 --> 06:38.314
[groaning]

06:38.397 --> 06:41.984
Kong's tracker will lead Lukas
and his band of fools

06:42.068 --> 06:44.570
-straight into my hands.
-[grunts]

06:44.654 --> 06:47.156
I can't wait to see the look
on my brother's face

06:47.240 --> 06:51.119
when I show him what's become
of his pea-brained primate pet.

06:51.202 --> 06:53.996
Just the thought of his self-righteous
whining is making me--

06:54.080 --> 06:55.123
[sneezes]

06:58.376 --> 07:00.711
Ha! Well done, Botila!

07:00.795 --> 07:03.047
You were always full of surprises!

07:03.131 --> 07:06.300
Come out, come out, wherever you are!

07:07.176 --> 07:11.139
Or maybe I'll just send
my reprogrammed bionobots to you!

07:16.936 --> 07:20.690
I've made your destruction
their number one priority!

07:27.780 --> 07:29.198
[beeps]

07:30.575 --> 07:33.536
[Lukas] Been running non-stop
since we let Richard go in Egypt.

07:33.619 --> 07:35.580
That may have been a mistake.

07:35.663 --> 07:38.166
My brother hates Kong
and this reeks of his doing.

07:38.249 --> 07:39.250
Maybe.

07:39.333 --> 07:42.670
But, remember, when Botila was inside
my mind, she saw Ape City.

07:42.753 --> 07:44.213
Who knows what else she learned?

07:44.297 --> 07:47.008
You thought she was telling the truth
about being locked up

07:47.091 --> 07:48.968
when we saw her on the holo-screen.

07:49.051 --> 07:50.303
It doesn't make sense.

07:50.386 --> 07:53.097
Unless Richard and Botila
joined forces again

07:53.181 --> 07:55.099
and the whole thing's just a scam.

07:55.725 --> 07:58.436
I doubt my brother
could ever forgive Botila.

08:08.279 --> 08:09.113
[grunts]

08:10.156 --> 08:11.073
Ugh!

08:14.494 --> 08:16.621
The clones disabled my weapons.

08:16.704 --> 08:19.165
So I'll have to borrow yours!

08:19.248 --> 08:20.082
[grunts]

08:20.917 --> 08:21.751
[grunts]

08:29.634 --> 08:31.636
Impressive.

08:31.719 --> 08:33.554
Most impressive.

08:36.515 --> 08:39.559
You truly are my finest creation.

08:39.644 --> 08:41.895
Except me, of course.

08:41.979 --> 08:45.233
There will never be a more
perfect organism than myself!

08:45.316 --> 08:48.069
Oh, I think we have visitors.

08:49.320 --> 08:51.906
Not again!

08:53.407 --> 08:54.617
[scoffs]

08:59.247 --> 09:02.625
I can't see you, but I can sense you.

09:08.297 --> 09:10.007
Be prepared for anything.

09:12.510 --> 09:13.678
[Danny] Look!

09:14.262 --> 09:15.263
Kong!

09:15.346 --> 09:16.931
[hooting]

09:18.558 --> 09:19.976
-[Richard grunts]
-Whoa!

09:20.059 --> 09:22.019
[all screaming]

09:22.103 --> 09:23.729
[both screaming]

09:23.813 --> 09:25.731
-Jet packs! Now!
-[alarm sounding]

09:25.815 --> 09:28.067
You guys get clear! I'll land this thing!

09:33.948 --> 09:36.409
-Richard?
-Hello, little brother.

09:36.492 --> 09:38.035
Come and play.

09:38.119 --> 09:39.829
[electricity crackling]

09:41.622 --> 09:43.124
Guess I'm grounded for now.

09:45.835 --> 09:46.919
[grunts]

09:50.089 --> 09:53.718
Regular-sized Richard was bad enough.
This is ridiculous.

09:58.973 --> 10:02.018
Let's see how he likes it
when I fry his Frankenbots!

10:02.685 --> 10:07.815
You always thought you were such a big man
with Kong at your back, didn't you, Lukas?

10:07.898 --> 10:11.027
Well, who's the big man now?

10:11.110 --> 10:14.071
C'mon, Danny! We have to help Kong!

10:15.531 --> 10:19.035
I don't want to hurt you, Richard,
but I've got to stop you!

10:19.118 --> 10:20.786
You'll do neither!

10:20.870 --> 10:23.497
Okay, now how do we get him out of there?

10:23.581 --> 10:24.957
Hey, what's that?

10:27.209 --> 10:29.420
I don't know, but it looks important.

10:30.880 --> 10:34.050
It looks like the source of the cage,
but how do we shut it off?

10:34.133 --> 10:35.468
There's gotta be some way.

10:35.551 --> 10:37.845
[Danny grunts]

10:37.928 --> 10:41.098
[straining]

10:42.975 --> 10:45.353
[panting] It's no use.

10:45.436 --> 10:47.938
[hooting]

10:53.110 --> 10:55.488
[laughs] Yeah! Works for me!

10:56.405 --> 10:58.616
[roars]

10:58.699 --> 10:59.575
[gasps]

11:00.910 --> 11:02.286
[grunts] Really?

11:05.998 --> 11:07.500
Uh, I'll need this back.

11:07.583 --> 11:09.669
You can let go now. [straining]

11:09.752 --> 11:10.711
[roaring]

11:10.795 --> 11:12.338
[straining]

11:12.421 --> 11:13.631
Looks like this is it.

11:18.135 --> 11:19.970
Not yet, Mr. Jones!

11:21.055 --> 11:23.224
My friends call me Jonesy.

11:23.307 --> 11:26.102
Thanks for your help.
Looks like I owe you again.

11:26.185 --> 11:29.063
I'm not keeping score, Jonesy.

11:29.146 --> 11:30.231
We've got to hurry.

11:30.314 --> 11:34.026
Between the empress and King Richard,
we're going to need some major muscle.

11:34.110 --> 11:35.486
I hear that!

11:35.569 --> 11:37.154
I'll be needing that blaster.

11:39.323 --> 11:40.282
Okay.

11:42.743 --> 11:44.412
[roaring]

11:44.495 --> 11:46.080

11:58.509 --> 12:01.262
[gasps] Thanks, bro!

12:02.221 --> 12:03.347
[gasps]

12:04.473 --> 12:05.516
[gasps]

12:05.599 --> 12:09.854
Nice try, but you can't protect him
this time, you stupid ape.

12:09.937 --> 12:11.397
[roaring]

12:13.065 --> 12:14.900
And you, brother.

12:18.696 --> 12:22.408
I've dreamt about this moment for so long.

12:24.034 --> 12:26.662
Stand back.
I'll have to fry this thing to remove it.

12:28.497 --> 12:30.166

[Richard grunts]

12:42.845 --> 12:43.846
[Kong groans]

12:59.528 --> 13:01.071
All right, Kong!

13:01.155 --> 13:02.406
Payback time!

13:05.701 --> 13:07.620
Her circuits have been fried.

13:09.497 --> 13:11.081
[roaring]

13:11.165 --> 13:13.751
I beat you once, you stupid brute!

13:13.834 --> 13:16.086
It will be a pleasure to do so again!

13:17.171 --> 13:18.506
[groans]

13:18.589 --> 13:21.550
And don't think
I've forgotten about you, brother.

13:21.634 --> 13:23.219
[grunts]

13:23.302 --> 13:24.845
[groans]

13:25.471 --> 13:26.555

[Kong grunts]

13:40.486 --> 13:42.947
[roaring]

13:50.538 --> 13:51.622
On your right!

13:51.705 --> 13:52.623
I see it!

13:53.999 --> 13:55.834
You kids get somewhere safe!

13:55.918 --> 14:00.297
[gasps] Great idea, but I don't think
there is anyplace safe on this island!

14:00.381 --> 14:01.549
[Danny] Come on, Panchi!

14:03.384 --> 14:04.635
[both scream]

14:06.178 --> 14:07.388
Look out!

14:11.600 --> 14:12.851
[both chuckle]

14:12.935 --> 14:14.270
[whimpers]

14:17.815 --> 14:19.567
-[Danny laughs]
-[Panchi sighs]

14:23.112 --> 14:25.030
[Kong grunts]

14:26.115 --> 14:27.825
[roaring]

14:33.247 --> 14:35.416
[roaring]

14:36.417 --> 14:37.668
[hooting]

14:38.419 --> 14:39.295
[groans]

14:40.963 --> 14:43.424
[laughing evilly]

14:54.435 --> 14:55.603
[roaring]

15:07.656 --> 15:10.200
Something big is happening on Kong island.

15:10.284 --> 15:12.036
Alert the military.

15:12.828 --> 15:14.330
[hooting]

15:22.671 --> 15:25.049
End of the line, ape.

15:25.132 --> 15:27.051
[grunting]

15:33.140 --> 15:34.475
[grunts]

15:35.643 --> 15:38.854
[laughing evilly]

15:41.315 --> 15:42.524
Kong!

15:42.608 --> 15:45.611
Hold the line, Jonesy!
I've got to help Kong!

15:45.694 --> 15:47.321
Consider it held, buddy.

15:58.123 --> 16:02.252
[laughs] Do you really think
you can stop me, little brother?

16:02.336 --> 16:04.755
[Lukas] I was born 20 minutes before you!

16:04.838 --> 16:06.799
[Richard] Well, I plan to outlive you!

16:06.882 --> 16:08.384
[groans]

16:08.467 --> 16:11.387
[screams]

16:12.137 --> 16:14.014
[all screaming]

16:17.559 --> 16:19.478
[gasps] Lukas!

16:19.561 --> 16:20.938
[Lukas coughs]

16:21.021 --> 16:23.857
I'm okay. Help Danny and Panchi!

16:23.941 --> 16:25.818
Stay here. I'll be right back.

16:29.530 --> 16:30.698
[Richard] Perfect.

16:30.781 --> 16:33.158
Right in my sights.

16:33.242 --> 16:34.827
[Kong roars]

16:43.043 --> 16:44.712
[Richard grunting]

16:49.299 --> 16:50.759
You did it, bro!

16:51.760 --> 16:55.055
[Richard] Yes, I did, brother.

16:55.806 --> 16:58.726
And now yours is the last name on my list.

17:01.061 --> 17:04.022
Richard, it's not too late
to stop all this fighting.

17:04.106 --> 17:05.607
You're my brother.

17:05.691 --> 17:10.695
Your only brother is that ape
and now you can join him, forever!

17:12.364 --> 17:13.281
[Kong growls]

17:14.116 --> 17:17.493
Except it looks like Kong is ready
for another round.

17:18.412 --> 17:19.954
[gasps]

17:20.039 --> 17:21.665
[Kong grunts]

17:22.374 --> 17:23.584
[groaning]

17:28.338 --> 17:30.758
[roaring]

17:34.303 --> 17:36.263
Jonesy! The cage!

17:36.346 --> 17:37.723
Way ahead of you, buddy,

17:37.806 --> 17:40.768
I hacked the control
and synced the switch to our wrist comms.

17:40.851 --> 17:42.853
Mind giving us a hand, big guy?

17:42.936 --> 17:44.313
[Kong grunts]

17:48.275 --> 17:50.360
[grunting]

17:50.444 --> 17:51.278
[gasps]

17:51.987 --> 17:52.988
What?

17:53.072 --> 17:54.782
Kong, you miserable...

17:54.865 --> 17:56.950
[grunting]

17:57.034 --> 17:58.744
[helicopter blades whirring]

18:03.290 --> 18:04.875
You guys took your time!

18:04.958 --> 18:07.086
Looks like we missed all the fun.

18:08.629 --> 18:11.465
-[straining]
-[general] That'll hold him.

18:11.548 --> 18:12.925
I hope.

18:13.008 --> 18:14.676
I wish I could have done something.

18:14.760 --> 18:16.887
Anything to change Richard.

18:16.970 --> 18:20.557
I guess the best we can do
is make sure he can't hurt anyone else.

18:21.308 --> 18:24.228
We'll keep him safely locked up,
I promise.

18:24.311 --> 18:27.856
Ugh! I'll get out and when I do--

18:27.940 --> 18:29.817
[gasps]

18:29.900 --> 18:31.318
You were saying...

18:32.903 --> 18:35.072
Hey! I've got something!

18:35.155 --> 18:37.282
Look what we have here...

18:37.366 --> 18:39.868
Jonesy! You miserable meatbag!

18:39.952 --> 18:40.911
This isn't over!

18:40.994 --> 18:42.454
When I get my body back, I'll--

18:42.538 --> 18:43.497
[muffled groans]

18:44.790 --> 18:47.000
I think I like you better like this.

18:47.084 --> 18:49.920
Let's give her a jump start
and cross our fingers.

18:57.803 --> 18:59.054
[shudders]

18:59.138 --> 19:02.182
I wasn't sure if I was going to wake up
after that little stunt.

19:02.266 --> 19:05.435
Saving Kong was uncharacteristically
heroic of you.

19:05.519 --> 19:07.563
That's the deal
about thinking for yourself.

19:07.646 --> 19:10.065
You never know what crazy thing
you're going to do!

19:10.149 --> 19:12.693
That's just the kind of crazy
we like around here.

19:14.987 --> 19:16.738
I can't thank you enough.

19:16.822 --> 19:18.740
Never would've believed Botila's clones

19:18.824 --> 19:20.409
had so much humanity in them.

19:20.492 --> 19:22.035
[all] Thank you, Jonesy.

19:28.584 --> 19:30.294
[all chuckle]

19:30.377 --> 19:32.880
Richard and Botila are both behind bars.

19:32.963 --> 19:34.131
What do we do now?

19:34.214 --> 19:35.132
[grunting]

19:39.845 --> 19:43.432
Kong says he wants to live underground
with the apes and Zippi.

19:43.515 --> 19:45.559
[chittering]

19:46.852 --> 19:48.353
[chuckles]

19:48.437 --> 19:49.730
I could have guessed that!

19:49.813 --> 19:53.942
Hmm. That's great for Kong,
but I want to live above ground,

19:54.026 --> 19:55.485
maybe eat at a real restaurant

19:55.569 --> 19:58.655
and see a few holo-flicks,
like a normal kid.

19:58.739 --> 20:02.075
We're not normal kids,
but I'm with Panchi.

20:02.159 --> 20:06.038
Ooh, I'll be happy
as long as I have my family around

20:06.121 --> 20:08.790
and spend less time running for my life!

20:08.874 --> 20:09.833
[grunts]

20:09.917 --> 20:11.501
And Mummo's coming with me!

20:11.585 --> 20:13.837
Maybe we will open our own restaurant!

20:13.921 --> 20:16.506
[squawks] Good eats!

20:16.590 --> 20:19.593
But I'll miss you, my enorme amigo!

20:19.676 --> 20:22.679
Well, the threat is over.
Nobody's after us.

20:22.763 --> 20:24.640
We can come and go as we please.

20:24.723 --> 20:27.768
Yeah! Who says
we can't live in both places?

20:29.228 --> 20:33.440
[chuckles] I guess he can take
a well-deserved rest.

20:33.523 --> 20:34.816
[yawns]

20:34.900 --> 20:36.443
[wrist comm chirping]

20:36.526 --> 20:38.737
[general on comm]
Lukas, big emergency in Japan.

20:38.820 --> 20:41.990
A giant, mutated jellyfish
is attacking fishing vessels.

20:42.074 --> 20:43.909
We need Kong now!

20:47.746 --> 20:49.289
Sorry to cut your nap short.

20:49.373 --> 20:50.916
But we've got work to do!

20:50.999 --> 20:53.126
[grunting]

20:53.210 --> 20:54.795
[yawning]

20:56.380 --> 20:58.924
[roaring]

21:01.218 --> 21:02.886
[upbeat music playing]
