Previously on
<i>NCIS: Los Angeles</i>

00:03.897 --> 00:05.197
Is my partner under arrest?

00:05.281 --> 00:07.566
It appears your partner
only joined NCIS

00:07.650 --> 00:10.369
to track down those she believes
responsible for his death.

00:10.453 --> 00:12.588
The last time
I felt so powerless

00:12.655 --> 00:14.957
was when I was 15.
And the military police

00:15.024 --> 00:17.860
had no answers
about your father's death.

00:17.927 --> 00:18.967
I know what happened
to your father.

00:18.992 --> 00:20.192
What are you talking about?

00:20.213 --> 00:21.597
The man that's
killing off the team

00:21.664 --> 00:23.031
killed your father.

00:23.082 --> 00:24.650
What is his name?

00:24.717 --> 00:25.934
(gunshots)

00:26.002 --> 00:26.735
Kensi!

00:26.803 --> 00:28.187
(gunshot)

00:35.061 --> 00:37.212
(gasps)

00:37.263 --> 00:39.481
(coughs)

00:54.097 --> 00:55.180
Anyone see Kensi go down?

00:55.248 --> 00:56.748
No. Kensi!

01:01.588 --> 01:02.688
Kensi!

01:02.755 --> 01:03.922
Sniper! Stay down!

01:06.926 --> 01:08.794
(groans)

01:11.014 --> 01:12.214
You find the shot?

01:12.265 --> 01:14.483
Had to come from the west,
probably high ground.

01:14.551 --> 01:15.701
Might still be there,
might not.

01:15.768 --> 01:17.369
Well, there's only
one way to find out.

01:17.437 --> 01:19.438
Let's move.

01:39.676 --> 01:41.526
CALLEN: Kensi's gone.

01:41.594 --> 01:44.730
Harris chose this place
'cause he thought it was safe.

01:44.797 --> 01:47.165
Well, Harris ran out of safe
places a long time ago.

01:47.250 --> 01:48.450
I'd take the shot from up there.

01:48.501 --> 01:50.219
On the ridgeline.
Stay with the body, Nell

01:51.054 --> 01:53.438
Go!

01:53.506 --> 01:55.957
ERIC (over radio): Guys, I got
Kensi. She's on a park camera

01:56.009 --> 01:58.060
on a fire road above
you, moving south.

01:58.127 --> 02:00.295
It looks like she spotted
someone and ran after them.

02:00.363 --> 02:02.130
Limited camera coverage.

02:02.181 --> 02:03.965
This is not going to be easy.

02:04.017 --> 02:05.800
Who else knew about
the rendezvous?

02:05.852 --> 02:06.801
(sighs)

02:06.853 --> 02:08.570
Just us and Alex Harris.

02:11.324 --> 02:12.941
Sniper's hide.

02:12.992 --> 02:14.760
The shooter had plenty
of time to set up.

02:14.827 --> 02:16.645
He must've known
they were going to be here.

02:16.696 --> 02:18.146
Guy's a pro.

02:18.197 --> 02:19.915
Kensi must have
gone after him.

02:19.982 --> 02:22.100
So she's armed, pissed off,
and hunting down the one guy

02:22.168 --> 02:24.152
who knows what happened
to her father.

02:24.203 --> 02:26.004
Sucks to be him.

02:27.006 --> 02:28.840

02:30.560 --> 02:33.378

02:41.721 --> 02:43.055
(cell phone ringing)

02:48.861 --> 02:50.312
HETTY (on phone): Kensi?

02:50.363 --> 02:52.698
You don't have to do this alone.

02:52.782 --> 02:54.816
Remember that favor
you owe me, Hetty?

02:54.867 --> 02:56.368
Consider us even.

02:56.452 --> 02:57.619
Kensi!

Where is she, Eric?

03:53.759 --> 03:55.710
Our last contact with Kensi
was at the carousel.

03:55.761 --> 03:58.096
Now she's gone dark, and will
most likely stay that way

03:58.180 --> 03:59.431
until she wants to be found.

03:59.515 --> 04:01.099
NELL: She can dodge
surveillance in her sleep,

04:01.183 --> 04:02.984
and the chances of her
using a credit card

04:03.052 --> 04:05.020

pretty much slim to none.

04:05.071 --> 04:06.237
She's off the grid.

04:06.322 --> 04:07.989

04:09.558 --> 04:10.492

04:10.559 --> 04:11.993
He seems to have gone dark, too.

04:15.081 --> 04:16.081
Okay, does anybody
want to talk about

04:16.165 --> 04:17.398
the giant elephant
in the Ops center?

04:17.450 --> 04:19.334
DEEKS: Granger's the
only one besides us

04:19.401 --> 04:21.619
and Harris who knew about
the rendezvous in the park.

04:21.704 --> 04:23.404
Let's look at this
from every angle

04:23.456 --> 04:24.556
before we jump to conclusions.

04:24.623 --> 04:26.508
Let's start with
the common theme:

04:26.575 --> 04:27.926
Granger, Harris and Kensi's dad

04:28.010 --> 04:30.011
were all part of the same
black ops unit in the '90s.

04:30.079 --> 04:33.181
That would be Detachment:
Oscar-Sierra.

04:33.248 --> 04:35.767
18 kills in 11 countries
over three years.

04:35.851 --> 04:37.552
Most of which were made
to look like accidents.

04:37.603 --> 04:39.688
And all the guys in the
unit are now dead.

04:40.589 --> 04:41.823
Granger's gone dark, Hetty.

04:41.891 --> 04:44.258
He's the only one that could
put the pieces together.

04:44.310 --> 04:46.061
But we've got a pretty
good idea where he's head

04:46.112 --> 04:48.780
Track him down,
and bring him to me.

04:50.866 --> 04:52.050
Uh, Mr. Deeks...

04:52.118 --> 04:53.952
Yeah.

04:54.036 --> 04:56.571
Kensi is determined and lethal,

04:56.622 --> 04:58.623
but she will turn up,
and when she does...

05:01.110 --> 05:02.494
she'll need a friend.

05:03.496 --> 05:05.497

06:21.740 --> 06:23.208
ERIC:
<i>LAPD's reporting</i>

06:23.292 --> 06:25.293
an incident at the corner of

06:25.360 --> 06:26.711
Cahuenga and
Hollywood Boulevard.

06:26.796 --> 06:29.030
Witnesses say a young woman
with dark brown hair

06:29.081 --> 06:30.815
beat a man twice her size,

06:30.883 --> 06:32.550
then sped off
with his car.

06:32.635 --> 06:33.818
That's my girl.

06:34.920 --> 06:36.004
No. I don't mean

06:36.055 --> 06:37.538
that kind of "my girl,"

06:37.590 --> 06:39.373
I mean the other
kind of "my girl."

06:39.425 --> 06:41.142
"The other kind
of 'my girl."

06:41.210 --> 06:42.977
And what kind would
that be, exactly?

06:43.045 --> 06:44.546
Find my partner.

06:44.613 --> 06:47.265
Narrowing down a description
of Kensi's car.

06:47.333 --> 06:49.067
Then I'm starting a search.

06:49.151 --> 06:50.735
The place where
Harris was killed

06:50.820 --> 06:51.820
had limited camera coverage,

06:51.887 --> 06:53.321
but the carousel's
a different story.

06:53.388 --> 06:54.171
So what do we got?

06:54.196 --> 06:55.596
It looked like
she was chasing someone,

06:55.608 --> 06:57.692
so I pulled some footage
from a few seconds before.

06:57.743 --> 07:00.545
Let's see...

07:00.613 --> 07:02.847
Freeze it.

07:04.617 --> 07:07.085
So that's what the elephant
in the room actually looks like.

of Assistant Director Granger

09:03.832 --> 09:04.749
fleeing the park

09:04.833 --> 09:06.751
after Harris was killed.

09:06.835 --> 09:09.649
Somebody had to leak the
location of the meeting

09:09.674 --> 09:10.455
to the shooter.

09:10.456 --> 09:12.173
It was either Granger or Harris.

09:12.240 --> 09:14.926
Harris seemed pretty intent on
walking away from this alive.

09:15.010 --> 09:16.377
All right, well,
the good news is,

09:16.428 --> 09:17.945
I've located the car
Kensi's driving.

09:18.013 --> 09:21.582
It's a rental equipped with GPS,
last destination programmed

09:21.633 --> 09:23.584
into the vehicle an hour ago.

09:23.635 --> 09:25.252
Residential address in Encino.

09:25.304 --> 09:29.307
Property records show it's
owned by one Julia Feldman.

09:29.391 --> 09:30.758
Now, Deeks is on his way.

09:30.809 --> 09:32.393
Unless Kensi dumped the car
and walked off,

09:32.444 --> 09:33.611
that's where she'll be.

09:33.695 --> 09:36.430
Tell Hetty we're almost
to Kensi's apartment.

09:52.664 --> 09:54.615
DEEKS:
What's up, killer?

09:54.666 --> 09:57.618
You don't have to shoot me,
I didn't mean that literally.

09:57.686 --> 09:59.620
What are you doing here?

09:59.671 --> 10:01.839
Just came to beat up
some bad guys,

10:01.924 --> 10:04.625
save the damsel in distress,
and ride off into the sunset.

10:04.676 --> 10:07.562
Oh... Oh, don't
make me laugh.

10:07.629 --> 10:09.564
Feels like someone's
grinding an ice pick

10:09.631 --> 10:11.382
into my ribs every time I move.

10:11.450 --> 10:14.652
I parked your car around the
corner if you want to take off.

10:14.736 --> 10:16.654
Who said you could drive my car?

10:16.738 --> 10:17.989
I just got it washed.

10:18.073 --> 10:20.825
Okay, just for future reference,

10:20.909 --> 10:23.327
badass rogue operatives don't
care if their car is dirty.

10:27.649 --> 10:29.000
I'm not done here yet.

10:29.084 --> 10:32.286
You took a, uh, high-velocity
round to the torso.

10:32.337 --> 10:35.640
The least you can do is let me
take a look at the damage.

10:38.093 --> 10:39.961
Kensi...

10:48.387 --> 10:50.688
You took your time.
Did you hit traffic?

10:50.772 --> 10:52.172
Put down the rifle.

10:52.224 --> 10:54.809
Unless you replaced Director
Vance without my knowledge,

10:54.860 --> 10:56.844
I'd strongly suggest
you try it this way:

10:56.895 --> 10:58.396
"Put down the weapon, <i>sir."</i>

10:58.480 --> 10:59.847
Do what he says, Granger.

10:59.898 --> 11:01.666
Or what, you'll shoot me?

11:03.202 --> 11:05.069
Point taken.

11:07.122 --> 11:09.173
Hang on.

11:18.634 --> 11:20.551
The place has been searched.

11:20.636 --> 11:21.802
It wasn't me.

11:21.870 --> 11:23.838
So we won't find
your fingerprints?

11:23.889 --> 11:25.473
You won't find
anyone's prints.

11:25.540 --> 11:27.058
What happened
at the park?

11:27.142 --> 11:29.827
I wasn't the one shooting
people, if that's what you mean.

11:29.895 --> 11:31.729
Still think
Kensi's a suspect?

11:31.813 --> 11:33.064
I did at first.

11:33.148 --> 11:36.234
But someone at NCIS had
to consider the possibility.

11:36.318 --> 11:38.486
Now I know there's
more to it.

11:38.553 --> 11:41.172
This either hasn't been
fired recently

11:41.240 --> 11:44.075
or it's just been cleaned.

11:45.661 --> 11:47.511
It's time we had a talk.

11:47.579 --> 11:49.080
We've got the place for it.

11:49.164 --> 11:51.065
Your boatshed, Agent Callen?

11:51.116 --> 11:53.367
You gonna put me
on the "bad side"

11:53.418 --> 11:55.002
of that interrogation table?

11:55.070 --> 11:58.739
You're about to find out... sir.

12:07.248 --> 12:10.017
You gonna tell me now
why we came to this house?

12:10.085 --> 12:12.803
Because the man tailing me
was headed here.

12:12.888 --> 12:15.089
Did you guys
question him yet?

12:15.140 --> 12:17.475
You didn't exactly leave us
a lot to interrogate, Kens.

12:17.559 --> 12:18.859
The guy's in ICU.

12:18.927 --> 12:19.894
I defended myself

12:19.945 --> 12:22.146
with reasonable force, Deeks.

12:22.214 --> 12:24.031
Right.

12:24.099 --> 12:25.549
So what happens now?
What happens

12:25.617 --> 12:27.118
when you catch up
with the guy

12:27.202 --> 12:28.619
who took a shot at you?

12:28.704 --> 12:31.105
You gonna ask him if
he killed your father?

12:31.156 --> 12:33.741
Pull the trigger
if he says yes?

12:33.792 --> 12:34.909
(Velcro ripping)

12:34.960 --> 12:37.295
What if I do?

12:37.379 --> 12:41.048
We don't just smoke whoever
stands in our way.

12:41.116 --> 12:43.217
That's the difference
between us and them.

12:43.284 --> 12:45.920
Speak for yourself.

12:45.971 --> 12:47.305
I am speaking
for my...

12:47.389 --> 12:50.958
Wow, this is usually how
the dream sequence starts.

12:51.009 --> 12:52.526
Deeks?

12:52.594 --> 12:54.061
I'm sorry.

12:54.129 --> 12:57.464
You got... a little bit
of a... bruise.

12:57.516 --> 12:58.799
Really?

13:00.018 --> 13:01.602
Hold your breath.

13:01.653 --> 13:03.854
(gasps)
Oh, my God.

13:03.939 --> 13:05.323
You got
a cracked rib.

13:05.407 --> 13:06.857
It's not broken. If it was,

13:06.942 --> 13:08.409
you'd puncture
a lung at that angle.

13:08.476 --> 13:10.411
Yeah, well, I got lucky.

13:10.478 --> 13:12.413
A center-mass hit would have
torn through the vest.

13:12.480 --> 13:13.981
Okay.

13:14.032 --> 13:16.117
Oh, really?
Now you turn around?

13:16.168 --> 13:20.121
What's this got to do
with the woman who lives here?

13:28.547 --> 13:29.814
Hetty.

13:29.881 --> 13:31.115
Owen.

13:31.183 --> 13:32.967
Gentlemen...

13:33.018 --> 13:34.435
thank you.

13:34.502 --> 13:36.287
I'll take it from here.

13:36.355 --> 13:37.888
Shall we?

13:43.528 --> 13:45.679
(door opens, then closes)
Got popcorn?

13:45.731 --> 13:48.182
GRANGER: So, you're gonna remind
me of our history together?

13:48.233 --> 13:50.701
I'm going to insist
you tell me

13:50.819 --> 13:52.119
what the hell
is going on.

13:52.187 --> 13:53.854
I didn't kill Alex Harris

13:53.905 --> 13:57.241
or any members of
Donald Blye's black ops unit.

13:57.325 --> 13:58.376
Nor did I try

13:58.460 --> 14:00.611
to kill Kensi
or ransack her apartment.

14:00.679 --> 14:03.363
Whoever did is a very busy man.

14:03.415 --> 14:05.032
He's also been dead
for six years.

14:05.083 --> 14:07.068
Peter Clairmont.

14:08.670 --> 14:11.972
The commanding officer of the
black ops unit in question,

14:12.040 --> 14:14.708
formally known as Oscar-Sierra.

14:14.760 --> 14:19.513
I had two suspects in this case:
Kensi Blye and Peter Clairmont.

14:19.564 --> 14:21.148
Now that it's clear
that she's innocent,

14:21.216 --> 14:24.001
I know Clairmont's really alive.

14:24.069 --> 14:25.736
Explain.

14:25.821 --> 14:27.738
Your team was under
the impression

14:27.823 --> 14:29.256
Clairmont was killed
while working

14:29.324 --> 14:32.693
as a private contractor
in Afghanistan back in '06.

14:32.744 --> 14:35.830
So was I until I looked

14:35.897 --> 14:39.033
at the incident report:
car accident in Kandahar.

14:39.084 --> 14:41.068
Details of the crash
didn't track.

14:41.119 --> 14:44.455
So, I began
to consider the reasons why

14:44.572 --> 14:46.690
Clairmont would want to vanish.

14:48.293 --> 14:50.845
So Clairmont faked
his own death in 2006.

14:50.879 --> 14:52.913
Why not before?
Why not after?

14:55.684 --> 14:59.086
Now that I think of it,
2006 <i>was</i> a special year.

14:59.137 --> 15:01.421
Kensi Blye joined NCIS.

15:01.473 --> 15:03.641
Granger said the first thing
she did was start pulling files

15:03.725 --> 15:05.526
of the men who were in
her father's old unit.

15:05.594 --> 15:07.111
If Clairmont discovered an agent
with questions

15:07.195 --> 15:09.196
about her father's death
was digging up the past,

15:09.264 --> 15:12.366
I can only think of one reason
for him to disappear.

15:12.433 --> 15:14.618
He killed Donald Blye.

15:16.705 --> 15:19.290
The question is why?

15:19.357 --> 15:20.941
You don't have any proof

15:20.992 --> 15:23.911
that Clairmont killed
Kensi's father, do you?

15:23.979 --> 15:26.046
NELL:
Callen, Sam, the last phone call

15:26.114 --> 15:28.532
Harris made was
to Downrange Partners.

15:28.600 --> 15:31.335
It's a military contractor
who currently employs a man

15:31.419 --> 15:33.537
who's a facial recognition match
to Peter Clairmont.

15:33.605 --> 15:35.806
Granger's right.
He's definitely alive

15:35.891 --> 15:37.258
and working under the alias
"Peter Nelson."

15:37.309 --> 15:38.559
CALLEN:
Thanks, Nell.

15:38.626 --> 15:40.845
Harris must have discovered
that Clairmont was picking off

15:40.912 --> 15:42.480
the old unit.

15:42.564 --> 15:44.348
He could have tried
to cut a deal.

15:44.432 --> 15:46.083
Like exchange his
life for Kensi's.

15:46.151 --> 15:48.352
Clairmont betrayed him.

15:48.436 --> 15:50.380
Tried to kill two
birds with one stone

15:50.405 --> 15:52.388
at the park.
(sighs)

15:52.657 --> 15:55.077
Which means Granger was

15:55.102 --> 15:56.780
not the one that leaked
the location.

15:57.529 --> 15:59.163
- All right, I got to bring you in.
- I need a favor.

15:59.247 --> 16:00.664
All right, if you think
that I'm gonna let you

16:00.749 --> 16:01.832
go out and do this
on your own,

16:01.917 --> 16:02.933
it's not gonna
happen, Kens.

16:03.001 --> 16:04.735
Forget favors.
I'm taking you back.

16:04.803 --> 16:06.787
I need you to keep
the woman who lives here

16:06.838 --> 16:08.522
in protective custody.
Why?

16:08.590 --> 16:09.740
Just please do this for me.

16:09.808 --> 16:10.724
Why is she so important?

16:13.128 --> 16:15.729
Because she's my mother.

16:30.563 --> 16:32.513
I thought your mother was dead.

16:32.565 --> 16:33.927
I never said that.

16:33.928 --> 16:35.228
Yeah, but you never
mentioned her,

16:35.296 --> 16:36.763
so I just assumed that she...

16:36.831 --> 16:38.098
you know, had passed away

16:38.166 --> 16:39.716
or that you...

16:39.767 --> 16:42.602
We just haven't spoken
for 15 years.

16:42.670 --> 16:45.138
She lives 20 minutes
away from you.

16:45.223 --> 16:46.473
Deeks, I need help.

16:46.557 --> 16:47.774
Okay, then I'll bring
you both in.

16:47.859 --> 16:50.143
No. Somebody tried
to kill me today.

16:50.228 --> 16:51.561
I'm the target.

16:51.629 --> 16:52.696
That makes my mother
leverage.

16:52.764 --> 16:53.897
So the closer she is to me,

16:53.948 --> 16:54.781
the more she's at risk.

16:54.866 --> 16:55.716
I understand that.

16:55.783 --> 16:57.434
Okay.
(phone rings)

16:57.485 --> 16:59.653
Hold on a second.

16:59.737 --> 17:00.620
It's Deeks.

17:00.705 --> 17:02.622
Deeks, it's Granger.

17:02.707 --> 17:04.708
Put your partner on.

17:05.993 --> 17:07.577
Yeah.

17:07.627 --> 17:09.796
It's for you.

17:12.083 --> 17:13.834
Who's this?

17:13.917 --> 17:15.585
It's Granger.

17:16.587 --> 17:17.921
And what do you want?

17:17.972 --> 17:19.406
I want the same thing

17:19.473 --> 17:20.840
you do: closure.

17:20.925 --> 17:24.011
Granger's on our
side, Kensi.

17:24.095 --> 17:26.930
GRANGER: There's a man from your
father's unit who's still alive.

17:26.981 --> 17:29.049
Peter Clairmont.

17:30.818 --> 17:31.968
You knew?

17:32.036 --> 17:33.970
He's in old photos with my dad.

17:34.022 --> 17:35.822
I thought I saw him
a few minutes ago,

17:35.907 --> 17:37.991
but I wasn't sure,
so I let him live.

17:38.076 --> 17:39.743
Now I'm sure.

17:39.810 --> 17:40.994
She let him live?

17:41.062 --> 17:43.980
Clairmont killed
your father, Kensi.

17:44.032 --> 17:45.582
Looks like he went after
their unit

17:45.649 --> 17:48.452
because you've got
too close to the truth.

17:48.503 --> 17:49.903
What truth?

17:49.971 --> 17:52.322
Officially, your father's unit
has 18 kills,

17:52.373 --> 17:54.241
but in fact, it was 19.

17:54.308 --> 17:57.260
That last one was an American,
Brad Stevens.

17:57.328 --> 17:59.496
It was made to look
like a heart attack.

17:59.547 --> 18:01.798
Who is he?

18:01.849 --> 18:02.999
He's a journalist.

18:03.051 --> 18:04.351
The last story
Stevens filed

18:04.435 --> 18:05.936
was about international
aid in Haiti.

18:06.003 --> 18:08.555
A week after
Stevens was killed,

18:08.639 --> 18:11.691
your father allegedly died in
a car accident at Camp Lejeune.

18:11.776 --> 18:13.777
HETTY: You could say
it was a coincidence,

18:13.844 --> 18:17.564
but this group of men
didn't do coincidence.

18:17.648 --> 18:19.316
The rest of Oscar Sierra's
targets were

18:19.367 --> 18:20.617
either war criminals
or terrorists.

18:20.684 --> 18:22.119
They were all foreign nationals.

18:22.186 --> 18:23.320
Marines don't take going after

18:23.371 --> 18:24.888
their own countrymen lightly,
Kensi.

18:24.956 --> 18:27.324
Stevens left behind a daughter.

18:27.375 --> 18:29.192
She works for the
<i>Los AngelesTimes.</i>

18:29.243 --> 18:30.243
Her name's Megan.

18:30.311 --> 18:32.245
I tried to reach her
over the years,

18:32.330 --> 18:34.498
but she's always reluctant
to discuss her father's death.

18:34.549 --> 18:35.882
Mm, she'll talk to me.

18:35.967 --> 18:38.218
Figure out the best way
to approach her together.

18:38.302 --> 18:40.003
But right now, Deeks
is bringing you in.

18:40.071 --> 18:41.471
No, he's not.
(line disconnects)

18:41.539 --> 18:43.640
We could get over
there fast.

18:43.707 --> 18:46.226
Maybe we ought to let Deeks
play this one out.

18:46.310 --> 18:47.978
I agree.

18:48.045 --> 18:49.679
Did you just hang up on them?

18:49.747 --> 18:52.566
Yeah. I've got to go talk to
this woman named Megan Stevens.

18:52.650 --> 18:54.151
Kensi...
No, no, no, Deeks.

18:54.218 --> 18:56.153
I-I know they want you
to bring me in.

18:56.220 --> 18:57.387
I'm not talking
about what

18:57.438 --> 18:59.339
they want, all right?
Forget what they want.

18:59.407 --> 19:01.341
I'm talking about
us, all right?

19:01.409 --> 19:03.026
I'm your partner.
What makes you think

19:03.077 --> 19:04.828
that I'm gonna let you
do this by yourself?

19:04.895 --> 19:06.729
Because you're my partner.

19:06.781 --> 19:10.867
And this is my mother...

19:10.918 --> 19:13.753
and you're the only
person I trust.

19:15.456 --> 19:17.541
Okay, I'll keep her safe.

19:17.592 --> 19:19.709
Thank you.
I will come back in

19:19.760 --> 19:21.511
as soon as I talk
to Megan Stevens.

19:21.579 --> 19:23.713
That's a promise.

19:23.764 --> 19:28.084
What do you, what do you want
me to say to your mother?

19:28.152 --> 19:29.719
Like, what am I,
what am I supposed,

19:29.770 --> 19:31.855
what am I supposed
to say to her?

19:31.922 --> 19:35.542
That you're gonna see her
soon? That you care about her?

19:35.610 --> 19:38.311
That you love her?
Like, what am I supposed to say?

19:39.997 --> 19:42.532
I don't know.

19:46.871 --> 19:48.238
(door opens)

19:48.289 --> 19:49.673
(door closes)
Okay.

19:56.831 --> 19:58.448
Can I help you?

19:58.499 --> 20:01.301
Yeah, uh, Mrs... Mrs. Blye.

20:01.385 --> 20:03.420
I was, once.

20:03.471 --> 20:05.155
It's Feldman now.

20:05.189 --> 20:08.958
Right. I, uh... (clears throat)
I'm Detective Deeks, LAPD.

20:09.010 --> 20:10.627
Have I broken the law?

20:10.678 --> 20:12.729
(chuckles) No.

20:12.796 --> 20:14.498
Actually, I have no idea.
Have you?

20:14.565 --> 20:17.083
Not that I'm aware of.
That's good,

20:17.151 --> 20:18.985
'cause that would actually
make this more awkward

20:19.070 --> 20:20.053
than it already is.

20:20.121 --> 20:22.522
And it's
pretty awkward.

20:22.607 --> 20:25.158
I need you to come with me.

20:25.243 --> 20:28.345
You're in danger.
There's a man

20:28.412 --> 20:30.146
named Peter Clairmont...
He was just here.

20:30.198 --> 20:32.649
He's an old friend
of my ex-husband's.

20:32.700 --> 20:34.618
Peter's a threat?

20:34.669 --> 20:35.552
Yeah.

20:38.706 --> 20:41.224
You okay?

20:41.292 --> 20:44.144
I know Kensi.

20:46.347 --> 20:47.614
I actually work with her.

20:47.682 --> 20:51.284
My daughter's a cop?

20:51.352 --> 20:53.336
Kind of.

20:53.387 --> 20:54.371
Did she send you?

20:54.438 --> 20:55.555
Yeah, she did.

20:55.640 --> 20:58.325
I tell you what.

20:58.392 --> 21:02.112
If, um... you come with me,

21:02.179 --> 21:03.630
I promise you'll see her soon.

21:03.698 --> 21:07.183
You clearly don't know the first
thing about my daughter and I.

21:07.251 --> 21:11.354
If you did, you wouldn't make
promises you can't keep.

21:11.422 --> 21:11.488
But...

21:13.457 --> 21:16.543
I'm willing to take my chances.

21:26.704 --> 21:28.088
Hello?!

21:37.231 --> 21:39.316
Megan Stevens?
Yeah. Can I help you?

21:39.383 --> 21:40.883
My name's Kensi Blye.

21:40.935 --> 21:43.787
I'm a federal agent looking
into your father's death.

21:43.854 --> 21:46.156
Look, my father died
a long time ago.

21:46.223 --> 21:48.108
I'd prefer not to talk
about it, okay?

21:48.192 --> 21:50.744
I know. My dad died
a week after yours.

21:52.229 --> 21:53.380
I think there's a connection.

21:55.533 --> 21:57.284
Thanks.

22:03.758 --> 22:06.026
DEEKS:
This is, uh,

22:06.093 --> 22:08.962
Agent Callen,
Agent Hanna.

22:09.046 --> 22:11.214
Julia Feldman.

22:11.265 --> 22:12.499
Kensi's mother.

22:14.051 --> 22:15.969
You do know
you're staring at me.

22:16.053 --> 22:18.138
I'm sorry. We've known Kensi
a long time and, uh...

22:18.222 --> 22:20.807
What he's trying to say is,
it's a pleasure to meet you,

22:20.891 --> 22:22.309
and we're glad
you're safe, ma'am.

22:22.393 --> 22:23.827
Manners of a military man.

22:23.894 --> 22:24.978
Navy.

22:25.062 --> 22:26.146
Please, have a seat.

22:26.230 --> 22:27.280
Thank you.

22:35.122 --> 22:36.656
(sighs)

22:36.741 --> 22:40.276
So, my daughter's
a federal agent.

22:40.328 --> 22:41.861
One of the best we've got.

22:43.164 --> 22:45.148
You find that hard to believe.

22:46.217 --> 22:47.617
Last time I saw Kensi,

22:47.668 --> 22:49.952
she was dressed as
a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle,

22:50.004 --> 22:53.306
and her favorite New Kid
on the Block was Joey.

22:53.391 --> 22:54.407
(chuckles)

22:54.475 --> 22:56.276
Where is she?

23:00.431 --> 23:03.683
We're taking another look
at your ex-husband's death.

23:03.768 --> 23:06.903
Is there anything you
can tell us about him?

23:06.970 --> 23:09.372
Kensi thinks I betrayed
her father for another man.

23:09.440 --> 23:11.858
She never forgave
me for it.

23:11.942 --> 23:15.078
Every day, I wake up
wondering if I should've just

23:15.145 --> 23:16.262
told her the truth.

23:16.330 --> 23:18.031
I've caught myself wishing

23:18.115 --> 23:19.833
I never learned the truth
about my father.

23:19.917 --> 23:23.119
Lies made for
nicer memories, you know?

23:23.170 --> 23:24.320
Mm-hmm.

23:24.372 --> 23:25.789
That's the reason
I never really wanted

23:25.840 --> 23:27.290
to talk about my
father with anyone.

23:27.358 --> 23:30.260
I know the feeling.

23:30.327 --> 23:32.796
Don told me that he had
joined a new unit.

23:32.863 --> 23:36.850
But the things
he said they were doing,

23:36.884 --> 23:40.220
well...

23:40.304 --> 23:44.958
let's just say they were
a long way from the Marines.

23:45.025 --> 23:46.242
I found my dad's
medical records.

23:46.310 --> 23:48.311
Heart attack didn't
make any sense.

23:48.362 --> 23:49.979
Well, did you look into it?

23:50.047 --> 23:52.198
Of course I did;
I'm a journalist.

23:52.283 --> 23:54.350
Never found a
shred of evidence.

23:56.620 --> 23:58.555
What about you?

23:58.622 --> 24:01.458
Did you find something
about him or...?

24:01.525 --> 24:02.692
Well, I don't have any proof.

24:02.743 --> 24:04.694
But I can confirm
that your dad

24:04.745 --> 24:07.313
didn't die of natural causes.

24:07.381 --> 24:09.899
Who killed him?

24:09.967 --> 24:12.886
I don't know.

24:12.970 --> 24:16.439
Sure you never
found any evidence?

24:16.507 --> 24:18.441
(phone ringing)

24:20.478 --> 24:21.578
Damn.

24:21.645 --> 24:22.846
That's is my office.

24:22.897 --> 24:23.897
I'm late for
a meeting.

24:23.981 --> 24:25.682
Sure.
Hey.

24:25.733 --> 24:26.666
Someone stopped by.

24:26.734 --> 24:30.003
Family friend.

24:30.070 --> 24:32.071
I waited for Don
to leave the house,

24:32.156 --> 24:33.840
and then I took Kensi with me.

24:33.908 --> 24:34.858
I lied.

24:34.909 --> 24:36.292
Said I fell in love

24:36.360 --> 24:39.179
with a guy in Boston,
and we were moving there.

24:39.246 --> 24:40.580
We got as far

24:40.648 --> 24:42.766
as Nevada when she ran away.

24:42.833 --> 24:44.517
A few days later,

24:44.585 --> 24:48.338
Don called to tell me that
she showed up at his doorstep.

24:49.757 --> 24:50.924
I knew I'd lost,

24:51.008 --> 24:54.093
but I had him put Kensi
on the phone anyway.

24:54.178 --> 24:56.596
She said she
never wanted

24:56.680 --> 24:58.348
to talk to me again.

24:58.415 --> 25:00.517
Daddy's girl

25:00.584 --> 25:03.703
<i>till the end.</i>

25:03.771 --> 25:05.722
(phone beeps off)

25:05.773 --> 25:07.307
You know more
about your dad

25:07.391 --> 25:09.192
than you're telling me,
don't you?

25:24.492 --> 25:25.909
(groans)

25:34.919 --> 25:36.920
(gasps)

25:55.009 --> 25:56.760
Kensi said she was
gonna come back

25:56.811 --> 25:58.170
(phone ringing) after she talked
to Megan Stevens.

25:58.171 --> 25:59.438
But instead,
they traded shots

25:59.506 --> 26:01.590
and Kensi killed her
in self-defense?

26:04.711 --> 26:07.263
Maybe Kensi fled because this
isn't the real Megan Stevens.

26:10.767 --> 26:12.051
This whole setup was a trap.

26:12.135 --> 26:14.637
So Clairmont must have assumed
that Kensi found out

26:14.688 --> 26:18.140
about Brad Stevens and
his connection to her father.

26:18.191 --> 26:19.892
(sighs)

26:19.976 --> 26:23.195
She could've killed Kensi the
moment she opened that door.

26:23.280 --> 26:25.648
Instead, she
invited her in.

26:25.699 --> 26:27.316
Sam?

26:41.965 --> 26:43.882
Meet the real Megan Stevens.

26:43.967 --> 26:46.418
Hands bound,
shot in the head.

26:46.486 --> 26:48.537
She was questioned

26:48.588 --> 26:49.922
and executed.

26:50.006 --> 26:51.774
LAPD said someone
searched the place.

26:51.841 --> 26:54.226
Clairmont's looking
for something.

26:54.311 --> 26:56.011
Megan didn't help him find it.

26:56.062 --> 26:58.013
Searched Kensi's apartment, too.

26:58.081 --> 26:59.682
(phone ringing)
DEEKS: So is this guy in town

26:59.733 --> 27:01.016
to kill people
or win a scavenger hunt?

27:01.067 --> 27:02.017
Go ahead, Nell.

27:02.085 --> 27:03.218
I've identified the woman

27:03.270 --> 27:04.853
who was posing
as Megan Stevens.

27:04.904 --> 27:06.689
Her name is Anya Fournier.

27:06.756 --> 27:08.240
She's a Corsican-trained
operative

27:08.308 --> 27:10.409
who's on payroll
at Downrange Partners.

27:10.493 --> 27:12.278
That's the same
military contractor

27:12.362 --> 27:15.631
that employed Clairmont after
he allegedly died in 2006.

27:15.699 --> 27:17.566
He brought a whole team.

27:17.617 --> 27:18.917
Nell,

27:18.985 --> 27:20.703
any way of telling
what we're up against here?

27:20.754 --> 27:22.521
Oh, I'm on it.

27:22.589 --> 27:24.406
Anybody else wondering
what the world's deadliest

27:24.457 --> 27:26.959
New Kid on the Block fan
is doing right about now?

27:39.806 --> 27:43.275
(panting)

27:47.614 --> 27:49.114
(grunts softly)

27:57.657 --> 27:59.658
(dialing)

28:02.295 --> 28:03.579
(line ringing)

28:03.630 --> 28:06.415
DEEKS: This is Deeks.

28:06.466 --> 28:08.000
Kensi?

28:08.084 --> 28:09.635
Kensi, is that you?

28:09.719 --> 28:12.421
Are you okay?

28:12.472 --> 28:14.340
Kensi, talk to me.

28:14.424 --> 28:16.425
Kensi?

28:19.346 --> 28:20.629
(phone beeps off)

28:20.680 --> 28:22.398
Cross-referencing
facial data points

28:22.465 --> 28:24.066
of our known
Clairmont associates

28:24.133 --> 28:26.318
against worldwide
law enforcement databases.

28:26.403 --> 28:27.820
The database shows

28:27.904 --> 28:30.839
a set of surveillance photos
dated back six months ago.

28:30.907 --> 28:32.491
Looks like Clairmont
and his team were hired

28:32.559 --> 28:35.377
to protect an American
CEO in Croatia.

28:35.445 --> 28:37.713
Local police
kept tabs on them.

28:37.781 --> 28:39.164
Can we identify
Clairmont's team?

28:39.249 --> 28:40.165
Multiple pictures.

28:40.250 --> 28:41.817
I'll run it through Photofuse,

28:41.868 --> 28:43.886
try to create
a better image.

28:47.674 --> 28:50.259
Isolating the clearest angles
from each one.

28:50.326 --> 28:51.777
Let's see what we get.

28:51.845 --> 28:54.496
Okay, guys,
smile for the camera.

28:54.547 --> 28:55.497
Mm, nice work.

28:55.548 --> 28:56.715
Okay, running facial rec,

28:56.800 --> 28:58.801
pulling up the files
on Clairmont's team.

29:01.688 --> 29:03.355
We got 'em.

29:03.440 --> 29:05.357
All ex-military, all shooters.

29:09.345 --> 29:10.846
(speed-dialing)

29:11.848 --> 29:14.400
(line ringing)

29:14.484 --> 29:17.653
CLAIRMONT: I guess you
really are Donny's little girl.

29:17.704 --> 29:20.155
He wouldn't give up either...

29:20.206 --> 29:23.876
until I beat him to death
with my bare hands.

29:23.960 --> 29:26.528
You really think
you're better than he is?

29:26.579 --> 29:29.715
There's only one way
for you to find out.

29:29.799 --> 29:32.217
You don't know me, Clairmont.

29:32.302 --> 29:33.869
Staying alone is the only way
to guarantee

29:33.920 --> 29:35.921
you'll be the one
that kills me in the end.

29:36.005 --> 29:38.373
This ends today.

29:38.425 --> 29:39.925
I'll be waiting.

29:41.177 --> 29:42.878
Brad Stevens was targeted
in 1997.

29:42.929 --> 29:44.546
We still don't know why.

29:44.597 --> 29:47.516
A week later, Clairmont
kills Kensi's father.

29:47.567 --> 29:50.569
But nine years pass by,
Kensi joins NCIS,

29:50.653 --> 29:52.671
starts asking questions.

29:52.739 --> 29:55.908
Clairmont realizes his past
is catching up with him,

29:55.992 --> 29:57.726
fakes his own death.

29:57.794 --> 29:59.528
And it worked until he heard
that Kensi was

29:59.579 --> 30:00.679
questioning guys
in his old unit.

30:00.747 --> 30:02.181
Starts killing
them off.

30:02.248 --> 30:04.450
Where does Assistant Director
Granger fit into all this?

30:04.517 --> 30:07.803
Certain point, it became
personal for him, too.

30:07.871 --> 30:10.923
So I just got off the phone
with a retired newspaper editor.

30:11.007 --> 30:13.142
One of his reporters: none
other than Brad Stevens.

30:13.209 --> 30:16.028
And guess what?

30:16.095 --> 30:17.880
The story he was working on
when he died

30:17.931 --> 30:20.032
wasn't really about
international aid in Haiti.

30:20.099 --> 30:21.082
It was about Peter Clairmont.

30:21.134 --> 30:22.301
In 1997,

30:22.385 --> 30:24.720
Clairmont got drunk at a bar
in Port-au-Prince,

30:24.771 --> 30:26.321
he killed a civilian.

30:26.389 --> 30:28.807
Stevens puts that story out,
Clairmont's cover's blown.

30:28.892 --> 30:30.442
He would have lost his command

30:30.527 --> 30:31.760
and got put
in prison.

30:31.811 --> 30:32.761
Stevens died,

30:32.812 --> 30:33.896
story was never published.

30:33.947 --> 30:35.731
We got to tell Granger.

30:35.782 --> 30:37.115
ERIC:
He's with Hetty.

30:37.183 --> 30:38.817
Megan Stevens kept
a safety deposit box;

30:38.902 --> 30:40.536
they're arranging for a warrant.

31:08.398 --> 31:10.399
♪

31:39.012 --> 31:41.013
♪

31:54.110 --> 31:56.845
(dialing)

31:56.896 --> 31:58.897
(line ringing)

32:02.018 --> 32:05.871
(phone ringing) Uh, guys, there's a call
coming in on the secured line.

32:05.955 --> 32:09.190
It's originating from
Julia Feldman's house.

32:09.242 --> 32:10.859
Hello?

32:10.927 --> 32:12.010
It's an open line.

32:12.078 --> 32:13.262
That's weird.

32:13.329 --> 32:15.264
Her mother's still
back in the boatshed.

32:15.331 --> 32:16.965
Kensi.

32:17.033 --> 32:20.602
She'd know Clairmont would have
that place under surveillance.

32:20.670 --> 32:22.087
If Clairmont lured her
to the house,

32:22.171 --> 32:23.438
he's gonna have her trapped.

32:23.506 --> 32:24.606
No, it's Kensi
luring Clairmont there.

32:24.674 --> 32:26.369
He's the one
who's gonna be trapped.

32:26.981 --> 32:28.648
She's going to kill him.

32:40.335 --> 32:42.606
CLAIRMONT: I was beginning
to think you wouldn't turn up.

32:42.607 --> 32:44.942
I told my team
to stay outside.

32:48.080 --> 32:51.282
You really want to know
the truth about your father?

32:51.333 --> 32:52.950
Donny lost sight
of his mission.

32:53.002 --> 32:54.285
Forgot
he was a Marine.

32:54.336 --> 32:58.039
My father devoted his life
to serving this country.

32:58.107 --> 32:59.223
Wrong!

32:59.291 --> 33:01.309
Brad Stevens was a threat
to this country.

33:01.393 --> 33:04.345
A threat to our unit.

33:04.430 --> 33:08.299
Donny didn't agree; dumb son
of a bitch never saw it coming.

33:08.350 --> 33:10.318
As he laid there

33:10.402 --> 33:15.490
bleeding out, he tried
to convince me he had evidence,

33:15.574 --> 33:17.808
one day it'd all come out.

33:17.860 --> 33:21.913
Is that what you've spent
the last 15 years searching for?

33:21.997 --> 33:23.981
Evidence?

33:35.427 --> 33:37.161
What are you gawking at?

33:37.212 --> 33:39.347
It's just been a long time
since you've been operational.

33:39.431 --> 33:40.664
Sir.

33:40.716 --> 33:41.832
I lost Clairmont once.

33:41.884 --> 33:43.167
I'm not letting it happen again.

33:43.218 --> 33:44.686
What are we
up against?

33:44.770 --> 33:46.571
SAM: Clairmont's team,
as many as four shooters.

33:46.638 --> 33:48.056
Good thing I
showed up, then.

33:48.140 --> 33:49.657
Stick with me, cowboy.

33:51.360 --> 33:53.027
Federal agents.

33:53.112 --> 33:54.362
Drop your weapons!

33:54.430 --> 33:56.314
(rapid gunfire)

34:00.685 --> 34:02.487
(grunting)

34:31.550 --> 34:33.317
(groaning)

34:38.556 --> 34:40.558
(gunfire)

34:49.918 --> 34:51.936
(grunting)

35:09.754 --> 35:11.806
(groaning)

35:23.819 --> 35:26.770
(groaning)

35:35.664 --> 35:38.332
CLAIRMONT: Your father
and I were friends once.

35:39.635 --> 35:43.671
Brad Stevens was just
a difference of opinion.

35:43.755 --> 35:46.257
Otherwise, we were the same.

35:46.308 --> 35:50.461
My father was
a United States Marine.

35:50.512 --> 35:53.464
You're a killer who just
happened to pass through.

35:53.515 --> 35:54.949
DEEKS: Kensi!

36:03.692 --> 36:06.093
There's plenty of
time to save him.

36:06.161 --> 36:07.578
But I won't do it.

36:23.762 --> 36:25.829
Property of Megan Stevens.

36:25.881 --> 36:27.682
Our records
show this box

36:27.766 --> 36:30.501
previously belonged
to a Brad Stevens.

36:30.552 --> 36:33.554
Uh, this is the search warrant
you asked for.

36:33.639 --> 36:35.022
Thank you.
Thank you.

37:02.134 --> 37:04.368
So how does it feel?

37:06.037 --> 37:07.989
Feels like any other day.

37:08.056 --> 37:10.258
Ah.

37:12.394 --> 37:14.345
Why did you come to Los Angeles?

37:14.413 --> 37:16.180
Because it's my job.

37:16.248 --> 37:17.348
No, that's not what I meant.

37:17.416 --> 37:19.483
Why did you care?

37:24.189 --> 37:25.940
(on tape): This is Brad Stevens.

37:26.024 --> 37:27.742
DONALD: Your life is in danger

37:27.809 --> 37:29.327
because of a story
you're working on.

37:29.394 --> 37:30.828
It's about Peter Clairmont.

37:30.895 --> 37:32.013
STEVENS: Who is this?

37:32.080 --> 37:33.481
DONALD: You don't need to know.

37:33.548 --> 37:36.417
Believe me when I say
you need to drop everything

37:36.501 --> 37:38.669
and disappear now.

37:41.256 --> 37:42.906
My dad tried to save him.

37:42.958 --> 37:44.675
This is the evidence

37:44.743 --> 37:46.210
that Clairmont
was searching for.

37:47.763 --> 37:49.547
STEVENS:
Let's say I believe you.

37:49.615 --> 37:51.081
How would I disappear?

37:51.133 --> 37:52.516
DONALD: Look up a man in DC.

37:52.584 --> 37:53.701
His name is Owen Granger.

37:53.769 --> 37:56.086
He won't know
why you're calling,

37:56.138 --> 37:57.939
but tell him what I've said.

37:58.023 --> 37:59.390
Granger's a friend.

37:59.441 --> 38:01.392
The only person I trust anymore.

38:01.443 --> 38:04.011
Stevens didn't get
to me in time.

38:04.079 --> 38:05.363
Clairmont killed him

38:05.430 --> 38:07.348
the day after your
dad made that call.

38:08.567 --> 38:09.900
I didn't know
your father

38:09.968 --> 38:11.485
tried to
warn Stevens

38:11.570 --> 38:13.888
until Hetty played
this tape for me.

38:13.956 --> 38:15.756
And...

38:15.824 --> 38:17.992
this is your father's
sniper journal.

38:18.076 --> 38:19.427
He wanted you to have it.

38:23.715 --> 38:25.716
(sighs)

38:27.285 --> 38:29.020
I don't really know what to say.

38:29.087 --> 38:31.639
Well, there's
no hurry.

38:31.723 --> 38:34.025
I just heard from
Director Vance.

38:34.092 --> 38:37.979
He likes the work I've
been doing out here, so...

38:38.063 --> 38:40.181
looks like you'll be
seeing more of me.

38:45.354 --> 38:47.154
Thank you.

38:51.326 --> 38:55.162
HETTY: So... we'll be
seeing more of you,

38:55.247 --> 38:57.248
eh?

39:04.823 --> 39:06.590
Welcome back.

39:06.658 --> 39:08.442
How does it feel?

39:08.510 --> 39:10.027
People keep asking me that.

39:10.095 --> 39:11.262
(chuckles)

39:11.329 --> 39:13.831
That tends to happen
when they care about you.

39:16.167 --> 39:17.968
Well, I guess I know that things

39:18.020 --> 39:20.304
will never be the same
for me, and...

39:20.355 --> 39:22.406
it's strange.

39:22.474 --> 39:25.175
It's also a good thing.

39:27.029 --> 39:28.662
See you tomorrow, Kens.

39:37.322 --> 39:40.207
I owe you an apology.

39:41.243 --> 39:42.877
There's a lot
I never told you.

39:42.961 --> 39:45.946
I'll settle for a beer every
day for the rest of my life.

39:48.633 --> 39:50.885
I just dropped your
mom off at home.

39:50.969 --> 39:52.553
You nervous?

39:53.588 --> 39:55.556
I cut her out of my life,

39:55.640 --> 39:59.176
and I never gave her a chance
to explain herself.

39:59.227 --> 40:01.579
I don't know how I will
apologize for that.

40:02.714 --> 40:05.099
I don't think
she wants an apology.

40:06.985 --> 40:09.653
I just think she wants
her daughter back.

40:14.159 --> 40:15.910
Night, partner.
