WEBVTT

00:01.439 --> 00:03.673
- You let a billionaire
hospital trustee die

00:03.674 --> 00:05.341
To save some kid
off the street.

00:05.342 --> 00:07.236
- I made a judgment call.
- You made a mistake.

00:07.237 --> 00:08.724
- This trip is gonna
get you back on your feet.

00:08.725 --> 00:10.773
- What trip?
- To the Hamptons!

00:10.774 --> 00:12.581
- Would you be willing
to be my faux beau,

00:12.582 --> 00:13.948
Pretend boyfriend?

00:13.949 --> 00:15.568
- You shouldn't fake date
for money.

00:15.570 --> 00:16.998
- It started out that way,

00:16.999 --> 00:19.602
But then I realized
that I actually liked her.

00:19.603 --> 00:21.435
- My parents
are gonna love you.

00:21.436 --> 00:22.838
Same fee as before?

00:22.839 --> 00:24.774
- I'm raising money
for a local free clinic.

00:24.775 --> 00:26.310
- It looks like
your family clinic

00:26.311 --> 00:29.481
Won't be up and running
until about 2015.

00:29.482 --> 00:31.345
- I can't let the board
get away with this.

00:31.346 --> 00:33.108
- You want hankmed
to run your clinic?

00:33.109 --> 00:34.938
Jill Casey,
Dr. Emily peck.

00:34.939 --> 00:38.102
- I hear that Emily peck
has decided to stay in town.

00:38.103 --> 00:40.100
Aren't you worried about
a competing concierge doctor

00:40.101 --> 00:41.366
Taking your patients?

00:41.367 --> 00:42.465
- What do you make of Emily?

00:42.466 --> 00:43.630
- I'm still feeling her out.

00:43.631 --> 00:44.797
- That spells danger to me.

00:52.300 --> 00:55.634
- "hamptons heritage
blasts community clinic."

00:55.635 --> 00:58.132
- Uh-oh, drama in hankmed.

00:58.133 --> 00:59.327
- Weren't you the one who said

00:59.328 --> 01:01.887
All publicity
is good publicity?

01:01.888 --> 01:03.253
- Not when it's your doctor.

01:03.254 --> 01:05.286
Nobody wants to see
their doctor in the paper.

01:05.287 --> 01:06.420
- Oh, really?

01:06.421 --> 01:08.220
Nice full-page ad.

01:08.221 --> 01:09.486
It's a bit vain, no?

01:09.487 --> 01:11.119
- That's different.
I'm blond.

01:11.120 --> 01:12.453
- It's a black and white photo.

01:12.454 --> 01:13.718
- You're missing the point.

01:13.719 --> 01:15.086
- And doing so gladly.

01:16.720 --> 01:19.086
"the doctor is in!"

01:19.087 --> 01:22.287
By the way, how is that ad
working out for you?

01:22.288 --> 01:23.588
- Wouldn't you like to know?

01:23.589 --> 01:24.722
- Haven't heard
your phone ringing.

01:24.723 --> 01:26.056
- It's on vibrate.

01:26.057 --> 01:27.457
- Right, that's why.

01:27.458 --> 01:30.426
- But, seriously, don't sweat it
about the article.

01:30.427 --> 01:32.361
It's okay to be polarizing.

01:32.362 --> 01:33.528
If everybody likes you,

01:33.529 --> 01:36.628
You're probably
doing something wrong.

01:36.629 --> 01:38.829
Besides, they only went
to the court of public opinion

01:38.830 --> 01:41.464
Because they knew they'd lose
in a court of law.

01:41.465 --> 01:42.898
- Really?

01:46.801 --> 01:49.335
You are gonna kiss me,
aren't ya?

01:55.007 --> 01:57.741
You are
so incredibly predictable!

01:57.742 --> 02:00.543
- [laughs]

02:00.544 --> 02:02.342
- Uh, I like
where this is going,

02:02.343 --> 02:05.072
But I must tell you, I have
a very busy morning tomorrow.

02:05.073 --> 02:07.236
- I wouldn't worry.
You're not staying over.

02:07.237 --> 02:08.435
No offense.

02:08.436 --> 02:09.729
- A little offense.

02:09.731 --> 02:11.558
- Oh, Hank, you don't
want to stay over.

02:11.559 --> 02:14.656
I take up the whole bed,
I talk in my sleep.

02:14.657 --> 02:16.990
- Well, look at that.

02:16.991 --> 02:19.225
Dr. Emily peck
has a fear of intimacy.

02:19.226 --> 02:20.859
- I'm not afraid of intimacy.

02:20.860 --> 02:22.726
I just don't like it.

02:30.397 --> 02:32.030
- My body wasn't designed
to function

02:32.031 --> 02:33.898
At this ungodly hour.
I'm sorry.

02:33.899 --> 02:35.933
- Then why is your body here?

02:35.934 --> 02:37.401
- Because your wonderful clinic

02:37.402 --> 02:39.536
Has triggered
a paradigm shift for hankmed.

02:39.537 --> 02:41.804
I'm here
to safeguard the paradigm

02:41.805 --> 02:43.105
As it shifts.

02:43.106 --> 02:44.173
- Well, you should be
more concerned

02:44.174 --> 02:45.941
About this hatchet job
in the paper.

02:45.942 --> 02:47.742
- Couldn't have come
at a worse time.

02:47.743 --> 02:49.443
- Look, if they have to go
to the court of public opinion,

02:49.444 --> 02:51.477
It's because they'd probably
lose in a court of law.

02:52.913 --> 02:55.947
- Nice sound bite, Professor.

02:55.948 --> 02:58.647
- Maybe we should take out
a full page ad.

02:58.648 --> 03:00.315
- Maybe definitely not.

03:00.316 --> 03:01.848
Look, the best way
to handle this

03:01.849 --> 03:04.048
Is to just let the story
run out of steam on its own.

03:04.049 --> 03:05.615
- No, I disagree.

03:05.616 --> 03:07.548
I think that we need to get
our side of the story out there.

03:07.549 --> 03:08.682
- I agree
with her disagreement.

03:08.683 --> 03:10.149
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

03:10.150 --> 03:12.350
- Jill, you will only be stoking
negative publicity.

03:12.351 --> 03:16.018
- No, I'll be
countering negative publicity.

03:16.019 --> 03:18.686
- 'cause if you counter the...

03:18.687 --> 03:22.021
It's too early for this.

03:22.022 --> 03:23.722
- Wow!
What a greeting committee.

03:23.723 --> 03:25.089
I hope somebody has
a giant prize check

03:25.090 --> 03:26.690
With my name on it.

03:26.691 --> 03:28.325
- No prize check,
but you have won

03:28.326 --> 03:30.826
Another month's supply
of interferon!

03:30.827 --> 03:32.027
- [laughs]

03:32.028 --> 03:34.295
I got a striped bass for you.

03:34.296 --> 03:35.830
- Jim, I love your fish,

03:35.831 --> 03:38.698
But you don't have to do this
every time I see you.

03:38.699 --> 03:39.798
Take it.

03:39.799 --> 03:41.165
- Oh, no.
- Just...

03:41.166 --> 03:43.266
- Okay, which one of you
lucky kids

03:43.267 --> 03:44.799
Gets to draw my blood today?

03:44.800 --> 03:46.667
- The privilege will be mine.

03:46.668 --> 03:48.001
- All right, let's get to it.

03:48.002 --> 03:49.969
- So, Jim,
you been keeping the diet?

03:49.970 --> 03:51.304
- Can't you tell?

03:51.305 --> 03:52.538
- I...

03:52.539 --> 03:54.339
- Any shot you're gonna
let me off of it?

03:54.340 --> 03:56.207
- Not a shot.
Sorry, pal.

03:56.208 --> 03:57.707
- But we are here
with some good news.

03:57.708 --> 03:59.142
We've set up
a new community clinic

03:59.143 --> 04:00.509
That'll run through hankmed.

04:00.510 --> 04:01.743
- You finally quit
that red-tape factory

04:01.744 --> 04:02.777
You're working at?

04:02.778 --> 04:03.778
Good for you.

04:03.779 --> 04:05.112
- Actually, no.

04:05.113 --> 04:06.879
Uh, this is
just a thing on the side,

04:06.880 --> 04:08.080
But it's a great thing.

04:08.081 --> 04:10.447
You can call us
any time about anything.

04:10.448 --> 04:12.181
- Even if it's
not my hepatitis?

04:12.182 --> 04:14.350
- Yeah. Why?
What's wrong?

04:14.351 --> 04:15.718
- I banged my ankle
a few days ago

04:15.719 --> 04:17.785
On the bow chock.

04:17.786 --> 04:20.254
It started bleeding,
so I wrapped a bandage on it.

04:24.056 --> 04:25.789
- All right,
you have a stasis ulcer.

04:25.790 --> 04:28.724
It's not uncommon
among hepatitis patients.

04:28.725 --> 04:30.059
The blood pools in the vein

04:30.060 --> 04:32.327
And stretches the skin.

04:32.328 --> 04:33.628
- When you banged your ankle,

04:33.629 --> 04:35.697
It cut the vein
and started the bleeding.

04:45.172 --> 04:48.506
- So I'm putting on something
called an unna boot.

04:48.507 --> 04:52.409
It's gauze soaked
in calamine and zinc oxide.

04:52.410 --> 04:54.511
You need to leave
this one for five days.

04:54.512 --> 04:56.880
- 'kay.

04:56.881 --> 05:00.753
This is for the ulcer.

05:00.754 --> 05:02.588
- Uh, fish guy.

05:02.589 --> 05:04.690
- Thank you so much.

05:04.691 --> 05:06.325
- Keep the change.

05:06.326 --> 05:09.094
- This is the worst morning
of my life.

05:16.701 --> 05:18.035
- Hey, thanks for the lift.

05:18.036 --> 05:19.769
- Sure.

05:19.770 --> 05:21.703
Oh, crap!
There's Dr. Blair.

05:21.704 --> 05:22.971
Just tell me when she's gone.

05:22.972 --> 05:24.972
- Uh, okay.
- Is she gone?

05:24.973 --> 05:26.073
No, she's coming over here.
- What?

05:26.074 --> 05:27.340
Why didn't you tell me?

05:27.341 --> 05:28.574
- You only told me to tell you
when she was gone.

05:28.575 --> 05:29.908
- Well, drive away, Hank!

05:29.909 --> 05:31.542
- I can't.
We've already made eye contact.

05:31.543 --> 05:33.110
It'll look like
I'm trying to avoid her.

05:33.111 --> 05:34.344
- You are.
- No, you are.

05:34.345 --> 05:35.345
She's ten feet and closing.

05:35.346 --> 05:36.546
- What do I do?

05:36.547 --> 05:38.681
- I'd suggest sitting up.

05:38.682 --> 05:40.749
- Oh, found it!

05:40.750 --> 05:43.118
Okay, you really
need to get a change purse.

05:43.119 --> 05:44.619
- Okay.
- Dr. Lawson,

05:44.620 --> 05:46.320
Miss Casey,

05:46.321 --> 05:47.987
Don't mean to interrupt.

05:47.988 --> 05:49.421
- No.
- But about the article.

05:49.422 --> 05:52.023
I had hoped to speak to you
before it came out.

05:52.024 --> 05:54.191
And first of all,
I have to apologize.

05:54.192 --> 05:56.659
I was completely misquoted.

05:56.660 --> 05:58.260
- Really?

05:58.261 --> 06:00.429
- The interview was intended
more as a reconciliation.

06:00.430 --> 06:01.664
I want to work this out.

06:01.665 --> 06:03.900
I want the clinic
at hamptons heritage

06:03.901 --> 06:05.704
So that we can help
more people.

06:05.705 --> 06:09.143
With all due respect,
Dr. Lawson is only one doctor.

06:09.144 --> 06:11.583
You can only help
one person at a time.

06:11.584 --> 06:13.385
- We're helping people now.

06:13.386 --> 06:15.854
- Is it better
to help a few people now,

06:15.855 --> 06:17.956
Rather than help many
in a couple of years

06:17.957 --> 06:20.291
When hamptons heritage
opens the clinic?

06:20.292 --> 06:22.760
- You mean
if you open the clinic.

06:22.761 --> 06:24.094
I read your proposal.

06:24.095 --> 06:25.896
You could use that money
for anything you want.

06:25.897 --> 06:28.731
- I want a community clinic.

06:28.732 --> 06:30.066
- So do I.

06:30.067 --> 06:31.833
- I think we can do
more good together

06:31.834 --> 06:33.301
Than we can separately.

06:33.302 --> 06:34.435
Think about it, Jill.

06:38.305 --> 06:39.771
- Okay, she's gone now.

- So every time he comes home
from his mother's house,

07:15.352 --> 07:17.587
He's exhausted,
his stomach hurts,

07:17.588 --> 07:19.022
And he's not hungry.

07:19.023 --> 07:20.423
- How often is that?

07:20.424 --> 07:22.425
- Uh, well,
a couple of times a week.

07:22.426 --> 07:23.793
You know, we're
on a new schedule.

07:23.794 --> 07:25.762
I just moved in.

07:25.763 --> 07:28.231
- Oh, it's nice.
- Thanks. Thanks.

07:28.232 --> 07:30.867
Anyway, the point is,
my son's always had allergies.

07:30.868 --> 07:32.302
- Right.

07:32.303 --> 07:34.103
- And now his mom's
insisting that he's over them.

07:34.104 --> 07:35.371
- Uh-huh, but you're
not so sure that he is.

07:35.372 --> 07:36.605
- Exactly.

07:36.606 --> 07:38.474
That's him.
- Seems to be doing pretty...

07:38.475 --> 07:40.109
- Well, he's feeling better
now, so...

07:40.110 --> 07:42.143
Hey, Jake. Jake.

07:42.144 --> 07:45.212
Butterfly stroke, all right?

07:45.213 --> 07:47.047
Uh, uh, push off with...

07:47.048 --> 07:49.382
No, push off
with your feet in unison.

07:49.383 --> 07:50.449
- He's a good swimmer.

07:50.450 --> 07:51.917
- He's very good, and just...

07:51.918 --> 07:54.919
Sir, is that the hypoallergenic
turf I specified?

07:54.920 --> 07:56.387
I... hold on one second.

07:56.388 --> 07:57.755
Excuse me.
Let me just...

07:57.756 --> 07:59.223
- Yeah, take care of that.

07:59.224 --> 08:01.826
- No, no.
Jake, that's Dr. Lawson.

08:01.827 --> 08:04.128
- I got your towel, bud.

08:04.129 --> 08:05.829
Hey, Jake, I'm Dr. Lawson,

08:05.830 --> 08:06.997
But you can call me Hank.

08:06.998 --> 08:08.031
- Hi, Hank.

08:08.032 --> 08:09.333
- Have a seat.

08:09.334 --> 08:12.302
You have got
a solid butterfly stroke.

08:12.303 --> 08:13.303
- Thanks.

08:13.304 --> 08:15.037
- So your dad told me

08:15.038 --> 08:16.672
You weren't feeling well
earlier.

08:16.673 --> 08:18.306
- My stomach hurt,
but I feel good now.

08:18.307 --> 08:19.708
- Okay.

08:19.709 --> 08:21.711
How old are you?

08:21.712 --> 08:24.013
- People think I'm six,
but I'm actually seven.

08:24.014 --> 08:25.315
- Oh, no,
you're definitely seven.

08:25.316 --> 08:27.349
Can you open your mouth for me?

08:27.350 --> 08:29.417
So you're in, what,
second grade?

08:29.418 --> 08:30.651
- Uh-huh.

08:30.652 --> 08:32.385
- Uh-huh.
You married?

08:32.386 --> 08:34.654
- [laughs] I'm a kid.

08:34.655 --> 08:36.923
- I don't know,
kids these days, it's possible.

08:36.924 --> 08:38.325
All right,
you got a girlfriend?

08:38.326 --> 08:42.095
Ohh. You do.

08:42.096 --> 08:43.897
You do have a girlfriend.
What's her name?

08:43.898 --> 08:46.399
- Olivia.
She lives behind my mom.

08:46.400 --> 08:48.200
- Hmm.

08:48.201 --> 08:49.935
Would you lie down
for me, please?

08:52.972 --> 08:55.006
Okay.

08:55.007 --> 08:57.208
- That tickles!

08:57.209 --> 08:59.046
- It's supposed to tickle.

09:02.616 --> 09:03.949
Okay, you can sit up, Jake.

09:06.152 --> 09:08.119
Jake, how'd you get
that scratch?

09:08.120 --> 09:10.321
- Climbing a tree at my mom's.

09:10.322 --> 09:12.023
- Your mom's, huh?

09:12.024 --> 09:14.258
So this Olivia chick,
talk to me.

09:14.259 --> 09:15.725
Is she nice?

09:15.726 --> 09:17.060
- Sometimes she's nice to me,

09:17.061 --> 09:18.827
And sometimes
she wants me to go away.

09:18.828 --> 09:20.062
I don't even know
why I like her.

09:20.063 --> 09:21.597
She's not like other girls.

09:21.598 --> 09:23.865
- Maybe that's
why you like her.

09:23.866 --> 09:25.166
- How is he?

09:25.167 --> 09:26.501
- He's doing great.

09:26.502 --> 09:27.701
Might have been
a touch of food poisoning

09:27.702 --> 09:29.069
Or an allergic reaction.

09:29.070 --> 09:30.537
When was his last scratch test?

09:30.538 --> 09:32.472
- Four years ago, which I think
is too long ago,

09:32.473 --> 09:33.672
But what do you think?

09:33.673 --> 09:34.973
- Couldn't hurt to get another.

09:34.974 --> 09:36.508
We'll get one on the books.

09:36.509 --> 09:39.343
- So how have you been
post-break-up?

09:39.344 --> 09:41.044
If you want
to talk about it, that is.

09:41.045 --> 09:42.080
Him?

09:42.081 --> 09:43.916
- Nope, and no.

09:43.917 --> 09:45.083
But thank you.

09:45.084 --> 09:46.752
- Absolutely.
- Here.

09:46.753 --> 09:48.153
- Oh, great.

09:48.154 --> 09:52.856
So why are you still
going through so much trouble

09:52.857 --> 09:55.392
To convince your parents that
we're in a false relationship?

09:55.393 --> 09:57.026
- Well, I thought
about telling them

09:57.027 --> 09:58.227
That I broke up with you,

09:58.228 --> 10:00.294
But, at this point,
telling them a new lie

10:00.295 --> 10:02.762
Would be a lot harder
than preserving the old one.

10:02.763 --> 10:04.030
- Oh, yeah.

10:04.031 --> 10:06.631
- You don't know my father.
- You're right.

10:06.632 --> 10:09.334
I know nothing about
retired general William Collins,

10:09.335 --> 10:12.235
Currently the ceo of a
fortune 500 defense contractor,

10:12.236 --> 10:13.503
Who you,
along with many others,

10:13.504 --> 10:14.937
Feel will one day
run for president.

10:14.938 --> 10:16.306
I know nothing about him.

10:16.307 --> 10:17.611
- I'm impressed.

10:17.612 --> 10:19.449
- I once crammed for
an entire semester of italian

10:19.450 --> 10:20.850
In 36 hours, I think.

10:20.851 --> 10:22.185
- You know what?

10:22.186 --> 10:25.923
You are the best fake boyfriend
I have ever had.

10:25.924 --> 10:27.725
- I'm gonna take that
as a strange compliment.

10:27.726 --> 10:29.293
How many have you had?

10:29.294 --> 10:33.529
- Oh, a lady never tells.
[chuckles]

10:33.530 --> 10:35.230
- So why is there no bio
on you in here?

10:35.231 --> 10:36.998
- Well, because my father
already knows me.

10:36.999 --> 10:38.566
He wants to get to know you,

10:38.567 --> 10:40.068
But you need to be careful.

10:40.069 --> 10:41.636
He's gonna try to trap you.

10:41.637 --> 10:43.138
He's gonna order you
a second bourbon.

10:43.139 --> 10:45.073
Take it, but don't drink it.

10:45.074 --> 10:46.508
- Bourbon?
- Mm-hmm.

10:46.509 --> 10:47.742
- I'm gonna have trouble
with the first one.

10:47.743 --> 10:49.211
I warn you,
I have a very delicate palate.

10:49.212 --> 10:51.147
- Don't say delicate
in front of my father...

10:51.148 --> 10:52.682
Or palate.

10:52.683 --> 10:53.683
- Can I say it in italian?

10:53.684 --> 10:57.720
- Okay, uh...

10:57.721 --> 10:58.954
Do you hunt?

10:58.955 --> 11:00.988
- Like kill things with a gun?

11:00.989 --> 11:02.621
- You know,
it's not hunting season.

11:02.622 --> 11:03.922
It doesn't matter.

11:03.923 --> 11:05.723
But it is something
he likes to talk about,

11:05.724 --> 11:08.092
So read this.
That should be plenty.

11:08.093 --> 11:09.093
- Okay.

11:09.094 --> 11:10.995
- Okay, pop quiz.

11:10.996 --> 11:13.229
How did we meet?

11:13.230 --> 11:15.397
- It's funny.
You know how most couples

11:15.398 --> 11:17.932
Have like a sweet and tender
story abt how they met?

11:17.933 --> 11:19.233
We're not one of them.

11:19.234 --> 11:22.902
I was waiting
for a parking space in town,

11:22.903 --> 11:25.904
And my blinker was on,
there was no one else around,

11:25.905 --> 11:27.572
It was obviously my spot.

11:27.573 --> 11:28.806
The guy pulls out.

11:28.807 --> 11:30.875
Before I can take my foot
off the brake,

11:30.876 --> 11:35.012
Paige comes out of nowhere,
zips around my car somehow,

11:35.013 --> 11:36.313
And steals it.

11:36.314 --> 11:38.248
Just steals it
right in front of me.

11:38.249 --> 11:40.951
- Survival of the fittest.
Right, daddy?

11:40.952 --> 11:42.119
- That's right, sugar.

11:42.120 --> 11:44.522
- So I got out of my car
fuming.

11:44.523 --> 11:46.023
I March up to her.

11:46.024 --> 11:47.592
Before I can say anything,
looks me in the eye,

11:47.593 --> 11:49.160
And she says...

11:49.161 --> 11:51.663
- You're too cute
to get angry, aren't you?

11:51.664 --> 11:53.665
- She actually said at.

11:53.666 --> 11:55.700
I valeted my car,
needless to say,

11:55.701 --> 11:58.503
And the rest is history.

11:58.504 --> 12:00.538
- Very romantic.

12:00.539 --> 12:02.140
- Uh, another bourbon, Evan?

12:02.141 --> 12:04.609
- Of course, yeah.
Please.

12:04.610 --> 12:08.679
- Ige was telling us
you're a cfo of hankmed.

12:08.680 --> 12:10.147
What is that?

12:10.148 --> 12:12.516
- It's a concierge
medical practice.

12:12.517 --> 12:13.616
- Oh, I read about that.

12:13.617 --> 12:17.320
Medicine for rich people.

12:17.321 --> 12:20.189
- We also do some pro bono work
for a local free clinic.

12:20.190 --> 12:21.491
- That's wonderful, Evan.

12:21.492 --> 12:23.559
That says a lot about you.

12:23.560 --> 12:24.994
- I'm curious.

12:24.995 --> 12:26.997
Apart from her beauty,

12:26.998 --> 12:30.300
Which she gets from her mama,

12:30.301 --> 12:32.069
I was wondering,

12:32.070 --> 12:35.472
What do you find
most appealing about Paige?

12:35.473 --> 12:37.507
- Daddy,
you're embarrassing me.

12:37.508 --> 12:39.643
Evan, you don't
have to answer that.

12:39.644 --> 12:41.578
- It's very clear to me

12:41.579 --> 12:43.881
That your daughter
will do anything for love.

12:43.882 --> 12:46.650
Love for her boyfriend,
love for her family.

12:46.651 --> 12:48.819
She will go to any length
necessary

12:48.820 --> 12:52.522
To protect her relationships
with the people she loves,

12:52.523 --> 12:55.726
And that's
what appeals to me, general,

12:55.727 --> 12:58.496
In a very big way.

13:00.633 --> 13:03.568
- Evan, you were brilliant.

13:03.569 --> 13:05.670
How did you come up
with all those things?

13:05.671 --> 13:07.271
- It wasn't hard.

13:07.272 --> 13:10.474
- You're worth every Penny
I'm paying you.

13:10.475 --> 13:13.042
- Evan, it was really nice
to meet you.

13:13.043 --> 13:14.477
I hope to see you again
real soon.

13:14.478 --> 13:16.112
- Absolutely.
If you're here in the fall,

13:16.113 --> 13:17.781
Maybe we can go hunting
or something.

13:17.782 --> 13:19.516
- Really? I wouldn't have
pegged you for the type.

13:19.517 --> 13:21.450
- No, I try to kill
something every day actually,

13:21.451 --> 13:22.785
Even if it's just
stepping on a bug.

13:22.786 --> 13:24.887
I just love killing things.
- [laughs]

13:24.888 --> 13:26.522
- Honey, don't you know
someone who belongs

13:26.523 --> 13:28.056
To a private hunting club?

13:28.057 --> 13:29.691
- Tommy danford.

13:29.692 --> 13:32.293
That's where I dropped
that six-point buck back in '07.

13:32.294 --> 13:34.595
- Wow, how great would it be
if it were hunting season?

13:34.596 --> 13:36.197
- No, this is
a members only club.

13:36.198 --> 13:37.498
They hunt year-round

13:37.499 --> 13:39.533
As long as they replace
what they shoot.

13:39.534 --> 13:40.967
- That settles it.

13:40.968 --> 13:45.104
We are going hunting
Wednesday at dawn.

13:45.105 --> 13:46.704
- Dawn work for you, Evan?

13:46.705 --> 13:49.540
- You know, I always say,

13:49.541 --> 13:51.508
Uh, the early bird
gets the worm,

13:51.509 --> 13:55.010
And after he gets the worm,
we can shoot him.

14:04.653 --> 14:06.520
Divya, can I ask you
a question really quick?

14:06.521 --> 14:08.221
Be completely honest.

14:08.222 --> 14:09.956
Do these pants
make my butt look huge?

14:09.957 --> 14:11.558
- I wouldn't know,

14:11.559 --> 14:14.893
As I have never
looked at your butt.

14:14.894 --> 14:17.729
They do, however,
make you look like a jackass.

14:17.730 --> 14:18.830
- Well, thank you.

14:18.831 --> 14:20.131
- Divya, alien warrior.

14:20.132 --> 14:21.932
Oh, I'm sorry, Evan.

14:21.933 --> 14:23.100
<i>I thought
you were the predator.</i>

14:23.101 --> 14:24.468
Why so g.I. Joe?

14:24.469 --> 14:27.070
- I am going hunting
on Wednesday with Paige.

14:27.071 --> 14:29.806
- Hunting? You should
really stick to gathering.

14:29.807 --> 14:31.073
[bird call squeaks]

14:31.074 --> 14:32.975
Have you ever even held a gun?

14:32.976 --> 14:34.276
- No, I'm not gonna shoot.
We have it worked out.

14:34.277 --> 14:35.644
I'm gonna be with Paige.

14:35.645 --> 14:37.445
She'll do the shooting.
I'll just take the credit.

14:37.446 --> 14:39.580
- Sounds like
the working dynamic of hankmed.

14:39.581 --> 14:41.915
- Evan, you really
like this girl, don't you?

14:41.916 --> 14:43.649
Does she like you back?

14:43.650 --> 14:45.517
And why do I feel like
I'm in seventh grade?

14:45.518 --> 14:47.885
- I don't know what she feels.

14:47.886 --> 14:49.420
All I know is that
making her happy

14:49.421 --> 14:52.588
Makes me feel happy, so...

14:52.589 --> 14:53.923
- Wow.

14:53.924 --> 14:56.024
They grow up so fast.

14:56.025 --> 14:57.791
- They really do.

14:57.792 --> 15:00.362
- Hank, you got a call
about an hour ago

15:00.363 --> 15:01.398
From a Mrs. Zimmerman.

15:01.399 --> 15:02.499
- Yeah, Jake's mom.

15:02.500 --> 15:03.968
- She wants to see you
in the morning,

15:03.969 --> 15:05.870
And she also wants
copies of your notes

15:05.871 --> 15:07.905
And anything else
pertaining to her son.

15:07.906 --> 15:09.240
- Poor kid.

15:09.241 --> 15:11.275
Stuck right in the middle
of a divorce.

15:19.284 --> 15:21.285
[doorbell rings]

15:29.995 --> 15:32.196
Hello!

15:32.197 --> 15:33.831
Mrs. Zimmerman?

15:33.832 --> 15:36.301
- Come on around!
We're in the back!

15:40.640 --> 15:42.307
[dog barking]

15:42.308 --> 15:43.776
- Hey, pooch.

15:43.777 --> 15:45.411
Hey, little guy.

15:45.412 --> 15:46.780
How are you?

15:53.022 --> 15:56.224
- Keep going, past the rabbits.

15:56.225 --> 15:57.659
- Peppers.

15:59.229 --> 16:00.829
[kissing sounds]

16:02.065 --> 16:03.465
Uh, Mrs. Zimmerman?

16:09.894 --> 16:11.061
- Dr. Blair?

16:11.062 --> 16:13.029
- That's my maiden name

16:13.030 --> 16:14.764
And my professional name.

16:14.765 --> 16:16.899
- Well, I'm not sure
which one of you

16:16.900 --> 16:18.403
I should be
handing my notes to,

16:18.404 --> 16:20.339
But, uh, there you go.

16:20.340 --> 16:22.007
- Thanks.

16:24.143 --> 16:27.180
Why are you looking
at me like that?

16:27.181 --> 16:30.250
- No, no, no,
you're just very...I didn't...

16:30.251 --> 16:31.918
- Well, this is how I am

16:31.919 --> 16:34.253
50% of the time
I'm not working.

16:34.254 --> 16:35.954
Is that a problem for you?

16:35.955 --> 16:39.290
- No, it is not a problem
for me. Of course not.

16:39.291 --> 16:44.228
- So you're here to document
what a bad parent I am.

16:44.229 --> 16:46.363
- I'm here
because you asked me to be.

16:46.364 --> 16:48.431
I also wanted to see
how Jake was doing.

16:48.432 --> 16:50.700
- Well, how does he look?

16:50.701 --> 16:53.102
[laughing and shouting]

16:53.103 --> 16:54.336
- He looks fine.

16:54.337 --> 16:55.804
- Of course, he does.

16:55.805 --> 16:57.272
He's a happy kid.

16:57.273 --> 16:59.541
He's a great kid

16:59.542 --> 17:01.976
With a free spirit...

17:01.977 --> 17:04.544
And a big heart.

17:04.545 --> 17:06.313
- And he has a way
with the ladies.

17:06.314 --> 17:08.781
- [laughs]

17:08.782 --> 17:10.817
How did he look yesterday?

17:10.818 --> 17:13.252
- He looked fine yesterday too.

17:13.253 --> 17:18.125
- Did my husband
tell you that...

17:18.126 --> 17:20.560
He's trying to get
sole custody of Jake?

17:20.560 --> 17:22.361
- Uh...

17:22.362 --> 17:24.063
- Apparently not.

17:24.064 --> 17:27.598
Well, that's what
this whole thing is about.

17:27.599 --> 17:28.666
- So I take it you don't think

17:28.667 --> 17:31.001
There's anything wrong
with Jake.

17:31.002 --> 17:32.803
- He had allergies
when he was two,

17:32.804 --> 17:33.971
But he grew out of them,

17:33.972 --> 17:35.505
Which as we both know,
Dr. Lawson,

17:35.506 --> 17:36.840
Is very common.

17:36.841 --> 17:37.841
- Yeah.

17:37.842 --> 17:39.943
[phone rings] excuse me.

17:39.944 --> 17:40.943
I'm on call today.

17:40.944 --> 17:45.815
[phone ringing]

17:45.816 --> 17:47.250
- Can't get it!

17:47.251 --> 17:48.618
- Hey, Jake.

17:48.619 --> 17:50.321
- Hey, Hank.

17:50.322 --> 17:54.158
<i>- So, uh,
is that the Olivia?</i>

17:54.159 --> 17:55.593
- Yeah, that's her.

17:55.594 --> 17:56.793
- She's pretty,

17:56.794 --> 17:58.228
If you don't mind my saying so.

17:58.229 --> 17:59.428
- I don't mind.

17:59.429 --> 18:00.662
- So how you feeling, bud?

18:00.663 --> 18:01.796
Did you eat anything tay?

18:01.797 --> 18:03.464
- I had some waffles
for breakfast,

18:03.465 --> 18:04.499
Made 'em myself.

18:04.500 --> 18:06.834
- Nice, nice.

18:06.835 --> 18:08.436
Throw a little syrup
on those bad boys?

18:08.437 --> 18:10.171
- Yeah.
- Nice.

18:10.172 --> 18:12.804
- Jake, come on!
I'm ready to play again!

18:12.805 --> 18:14.673
- Bye, Hank!

18:21.949 --> 18:26.518
[phone rings]

18:26.519 --> 18:29.186
[rings]

18:29.187 --> 18:31.522
- Yeah, this is Hank.

18:31.523 --> 18:33.123
- Did I wake you?

18:36.026 --> 18:37.560
- Is this who I think it is?

18:37.561 --> 18:39.694
- I don't know.
Who do you think it is?

18:39.695 --> 18:41.329
- Marilyn Monroe.

18:41.330 --> 18:42.396
- [laughs]

18:42.397 --> 18:44.398
She's dead.

18:44.399 --> 18:45.933
- So you can imagine
my surprise.

18:45.934 --> 18:47.033
- [laughs]

18:51.871 --> 18:53.405
Can you come over?

18:53.406 --> 18:55.774
- Um, is everything okay?

18:55.775 --> 18:57.509
- Yeah. Yeah, it's fine.

18:57.510 --> 18:59.310
I just, um...

18:59.311 --> 19:03.213
I'm just lonely.

19:03.214 --> 19:05.815
- Oh.

19:05.816 --> 19:07.483
- I'm trying vulnerable out.

19:07.484 --> 19:08.651
- How does it feel?

19:08.652 --> 19:11.219
- Worse than intimacy.

19:21.663 --> 19:23.498
- All right, here's the plan.

19:23.499 --> 19:26.267
We'll hunt in two zones,
boys against the girls.

19:26.268 --> 19:28.035
Whoever bags the most birds

19:28.036 --> 19:29.536
Gets to choose
where we have lunch.

19:29.537 --> 19:31.471
- Dad, I don't want to do that.

19:31.472 --> 19:32.705
I want to be with Evan.

19:32.706 --> 19:34.774
- Sweetheart, you're
with him all the time.

19:34.775 --> 19:36.875
Besides, you want me
to get to know him, right?

19:36.876 --> 19:39.677
This is how I get to know him.

19:39.678 --> 19:40.945
- Your daddy's right, honey.

19:40.946 --> 19:44.214
You boys are goin' down!

19:44.215 --> 19:45.848
- Which dog you want, sunshine?

19:45.849 --> 19:47.016
- Patton.

19:47.017 --> 19:48.383
- All right.

19:48.384 --> 19:50.552
Let's go, macarthur!
[whistles]

19:52.788 --> 19:54.889
Stay 75 degrees on my flank,

19:54.890 --> 19:56.390
Don't break formation,

19:56.391 --> 19:57.624
I'll be on point.

19:57.625 --> 20:00.127
- So just to clarify,

20:00.128 --> 20:01.761
Um...What did you mean
by that?

20:01.762 --> 20:03.865
- What part of it?
- All of it.

20:03.866 --> 20:06.968
- I don't joke
when I hunt, son.

20:06.969 --> 20:08.970
Let's move out.

20:08.971 --> 20:10.105
[whistles] come on!

20:17.380 --> 20:20.549
- Now, Jake, Dr. Lawson
can't do a scratch test

20:20.550 --> 20:22.318
Until you take your shirt off.

20:22.319 --> 20:23.319
- I don't care!

20:23.320 --> 20:24.620
- Jamie, please.

20:24.621 --> 20:26.221
He's only doing this
to spite me.

20:26.222 --> 20:27.322
You know perfectly well

20:27.323 --> 20:28.723
We could have done this
in my hospital.

20:28.724 --> 20:30.192
- He gets sick at her house.

20:30.193 --> 20:32.261
I mean, can you imagine what
would happen at her hospital?

20:32.262 --> 20:33.830
- Why don't
I show you both to...

20:33.831 --> 20:34.831
The waiting area?

20:34.832 --> 20:36.433
- Great idea.
Thank you.

20:41.505 --> 20:43.406
- How come you don't want
to take your shirt off?

20:43.407 --> 20:44.774
- I don't know.

20:44.775 --> 20:46.442
- Jake, whatever you tell me

20:46.443 --> 20:48.511
Is between you and me.

20:48.512 --> 20:49.646
No one else will know.

20:57.319 --> 20:58.953
Did Olivia write this?

20:58.954 --> 21:00.621
- She wrote it on my ankle too.

21:03.125 --> 21:05.459
- I have something
that'll get that out.

21:05.460 --> 21:07.428
- How come she's so mean to me?

21:07.429 --> 21:09.130
- Thank you.

21:09.131 --> 21:11.632
Jake, I would love to be able
to explain girls to you,

21:11.633 --> 21:14.301
But I actually don't
understand them myself.

21:14.302 --> 21:16.136
- Really?
Aren you old?

21:16.137 --> 21:18.839
- Yeah, old enough to know
they're hard to figure out.

21:18.840 --> 21:20.907
Look, there's probably
something bothering Olivia

21:20.908 --> 21:22.109
That has nothing
to do with you.

21:22.110 --> 21:23.310
- Like what?

21:23.311 --> 21:24.578
- I don't know,

21:24.579 --> 21:26.079
But I'm sure she'll tell you,

21:26.080 --> 21:27.447
And when she does,

21:27.448 --> 21:30.217
Do not, I repeat,
do not try to fix it.

21:30.218 --> 21:32.085
They don't want that.

21:32.086 --> 21:33.286
Just listen.

21:51.903 --> 21:53.704
- That looks
like urticaria to me.

21:53.705 --> 21:56.140
- Oh, god, you've been
on the internet again.

21:56.141 --> 21:57.842
- Just because I'm not a doctor
does not...

21:57.843 --> 21:59.811
- Okay, guys, please,
you're not helping.

21:59.812 --> 22:00.946
- Okay, all right.

22:00.947 --> 22:04.115
- Okay, you're right.

22:04.116 --> 22:05.516
I'm sorry.

22:05.517 --> 22:08.885
We're both sorry.

22:08.886 --> 22:11.356
- Look, these tests can be
interpreted different ways.

22:11.357 --> 22:12.858
I want to send them
an allergist

22:12.859 --> 22:14.392
For an official diagnosis.

22:14.393 --> 22:16.661
- That's fine, right?
- Great.

22:16.662 --> 22:18.129
- Okay.

22:18.130 --> 22:20.231
- Jake, we gotta get
to math camp.

22:20.232 --> 22:22.900
- All right, sweetie.
Mwah.

22:22.901 --> 22:24.001
Have fun,

22:24.002 --> 22:25.270
And I'll pick you up
later tonight.

22:25.271 --> 22:26.471
- Okay, mom.

22:26.472 --> 22:28.273
- Good-bye, Jake.
- Bye, Hank.

22:28.274 --> 22:33.312
- [whistling a tune,
urine spattering]

22:36.584 --> 22:37.751
[zipper zips]

22:37.752 --> 22:39.619
- Don't ever do that.

22:39.620 --> 22:41.521
What if that fell over
and went off?

22:41.522 --> 22:43.189
That's how people get shot.

22:43.190 --> 22:46.392
If you're gonna hunt with me,
you're gonna hunt properly.

22:46.393 --> 22:48.827
[whistles] come on, boy.

22:57.402 --> 22:58.802
- Oh!

22:58.803 --> 23:01.071
- Oh, I am so sorry.

23:01.072 --> 23:02.539
- Jill, it's Emily peck.

23:02.540 --> 23:03.707
- Yes, hi.

23:03.708 --> 23:05.274
- Oh, my god,
I almost ruined your blouse,

23:05.275 --> 23:07.576
Which I love, by the way.
Is that Chloe?

23:07.577 --> 23:08.644
- Uh, no.

23:08.645 --> 23:10.879
- Well, I love it anyway.

23:10.880 --> 23:12.380
Funny running
into you, actually.

23:12.381 --> 23:14.382
I was just reading
the article on the clinic.

23:14.383 --> 23:15.983
For what it's worth,

23:15.984 --> 23:18.719
I think hamptons heritage
is taking the wrong position.

23:18.720 --> 23:21.053
If there's anything
I can do to help...

23:21.054 --> 23:22.655
- That's nice of you to offer.

23:22.656 --> 23:24.022
- I'm not just saying it.

23:24.023 --> 23:25.424
If you need another doctor,

23:25.425 --> 23:26.892
Please just call me anytime.

23:26.893 --> 23:29.260
- Thank you.
That means a lot.

23:29.261 --> 23:31.195
- Hey, you know, they only went
to the court of public opinion

23:31.196 --> 23:34.831
Because they knew they'd
lose in a court of law.

23:34.832 --> 23:36.533
- Is that a famous quote?

23:36.534 --> 23:38.601
- No. No,
a lawyer I once dated

23:38.602 --> 23:40.102
Used to say it all the time.

23:40.103 --> 23:41.770
- Oh.

23:41.771 --> 23:42.838
- I'll see you later.

23:42.839 --> 23:44.105
- Bye.

23:50.513 --> 23:52.214
[pheasant calling]

24:06.362 --> 24:07.596
[twig snaps]

24:10.766 --> 24:13.768
- Damn it, what the hell
is your problem, son?

24:13.769 --> 24:16.502
You act like you never
hunted before.

24:16.503 --> 24:17.502
- I'm sorry.

24:17.503 --> 24:19.535
- You're supposed to be

24:19.536 --> 24:24.273
75 degrees on my left flank
at all times.

24:24.274 --> 24:25.708
You want to get shot?

24:25.709 --> 24:27.342
- No, absolutely not, sir.
I do not.

24:27.343 --> 24:30.811
- [sighs]
just stay the hell behind me.

24:30.812 --> 24:32.313
Come on, boy.

24:42.123 --> 24:44.524
General?

24:48.293 --> 24:50.594
- Look, mom,
I think we got enough.

24:50.595 --> 24:52.930
Why don't we just go find
daddy and Evan?

24:52.931 --> 24:54.164
- All right, honey.

24:54.165 --> 24:55.599
Probably got 'em beat anyway.

24:55.600 --> 24:57.734
[gunshot, Evan screams]

24:57.735 --> 24:59.135
My lord.

24:59.136 --> 25:00.437
- Go, boy, go!

25:09.397 --> 25:11.164
- This is crazy.
- Uh, hello?

25:11.165 --> 25:12.365
- Oh, good. Welcome.

25:12.366 --> 25:13.499
Maybe you can reason with him.

25:13.500 --> 25:15.067
I came over to pick up Jake,

25:15.068 --> 25:16.902
And his father's afraid
to let him go.

25:16.903 --> 25:18.303
- Because he's sick.

25:18.304 --> 25:19.571
- He's never sick
when he's with me.

25:19.572 --> 25:21.673
- You let him eat
whatever he wants,

25:21.674 --> 25:24.342
Stay up late, and then he gets
sick when he comes home.

25:24.343 --> 25:26.477
- Home, Jamie, is my house.

25:26.478 --> 25:27.878
You know that.

25:27.879 --> 25:29.013
This is the new place.

25:29.014 --> 25:30.214
- Okay, guys, where is he?

25:30.215 --> 25:31.216
- He's upstairs.
- Upstairs.

25:31.217 --> 25:33.319
- Thank you.

25:35.422 --> 25:37.390
- Lovely day.

25:49.036 --> 25:52.838
- Hey, Jake?

25:52.839 --> 25:55.173
- Hi, Hank.

25:58.177 --> 25:59.577
- How you feeling, buddy?

25:59.578 --> 26:01.045
- Okay.

26:01.046 --> 26:02.647
- Did you eat anything today,
any new foods?

26:02.648 --> 26:05.751
Um, hot dogs, candy?

26:05.752 --> 26:07.520
- Just a turkey sandwich.

26:07.521 --> 26:11.023
- Turkey sandwich, huh?

26:11.024 --> 26:13.726
Did you feel nauseous
after you ate?

26:13.727 --> 26:17.296
- No, Hank,
I feel fine, really.

26:17.297 --> 26:20.066
[throwing up]

26:23.103 --> 26:24.736
I feel better.

26:24.737 --> 26:26.505
I always do after I throw up.

26:26.506 --> 26:28.974
- Wait, you've
thrown up before?

26:28.975 --> 26:31.410
- A couple of times...
At night.

26:31.411 --> 26:32.811
- Why didn't you tell anyone?

26:32.812 --> 26:35.180
- 'cause if I told my dad,
he'd blame my mom,

26:35.181 --> 26:36.815
And then they'd fight.

26:36.816 --> 26:39.318
- Jake, listen, I want you
to make me a promise.

26:39.319 --> 26:41.154
If you are
ever not feeling well,

26:41.155 --> 26:43.957
You have to tell your parents.

26:43.958 --> 26:45.058
Promise me.

26:45.059 --> 26:48.060
- Okay, Hank, I promise.

26:48.061 --> 26:49.695
- Look, I know
it's hard when they're fighting,

26:49.696 --> 26:51.997
But no matter
what happens between them,

26:51.998 --> 26:54.800
They both love you
very, very much.

26:54.801 --> 26:56.735
- I know.
[knock at door]

26:56.736 --> 26:58.671
- Come on in, divya.

27:00.675 --> 27:02.008
- How is everything?

27:02.009 --> 27:04.577
- Good.
We're good.

27:04.578 --> 27:08.848
- So, I've gotten
five texts from Evan

27:08.849 --> 27:10.350
Saying that you're
not answering your phone

27:10.351 --> 27:12.285
And he needs you urgently.

27:12.286 --> 27:15.087
- Urgent urgent or Evan urgent?

27:15.088 --> 27:17.322
- Well, he said it was
a 912 emergency,

27:17.323 --> 27:20.291
Which is apparently one worse
than a 911.

27:20.292 --> 27:21.592
- Okay, so it's Evan urgent.

27:21.593 --> 27:22.659
Can you handle it?

27:22.660 --> 27:24.027
- Of course.

27:24.028 --> 27:25.762
- How bad is it?

27:25.763 --> 27:27.297
Just be honest.

27:27.298 --> 27:30.802
- Relax.
It's just a flesh wound.

27:30.803 --> 27:32.837
- Sorry, could you speak
into my good ear?

27:32.838 --> 27:36.141
<i>'cause it sounds like you said
it was just a flesh wound.</i>

27:36.142 --> 27:39.144
- Press is gonna have
a field day with this.

27:39.145 --> 27:41.045
Gunshot wounds
have to be reported.

27:41.046 --> 27:44.347
I told you to stand behind me.

27:44.348 --> 27:45.781
- I'm sorry, I know.

37:28.415 --> 37:29.515
- How'the butt?

37:29.516 --> 37:31.150
- As long as I don't sit on it,

37:31.151 --> 37:34.621
Um, or lie down or walk at all

37:34.622 --> 37:35.722
Or clench it

37:35.723 --> 37:38.692
Or move it, um, it's great.

37:38.693 --> 37:40.460
Thank you for asking.
- Cool.

37:40.461 --> 37:43.195
- Hey, look, u

37:43.196 --> 37:46.465
I don't want to have
any secrets from you,

37:46.466 --> 37:49.334
So if I were to admit that,
hypothetically speaking,

37:49.335 --> 37:51.302
I didn't shoot myself.

37:51.303 --> 37:52.971
- Uh, hypothetically speaking,

37:52.972 --> 37:55.706
I'd say we should stop speaking
hypothetically right now.

37:55.707 --> 37:57.107
All or nothin', ev.

37:57.108 --> 37:58.875
- Fair enough.

37:58.876 --> 38:02.745
Oh! So here's something
that's not hypothetical.

38:02.746 --> 38:06.248
Dr. Emily peck faxed over
a request for Jake's records,

38:06.249 --> 38:09.418
Authorized by his dad.
- What?

38:09.419 --> 38:11.519
- She's now the Zimmerman
family's primary care physican.

38:11.520 --> 38:13.488
How did she even know
that he was our patient?

38:13.489 --> 38:14.855
- I-I-I...

38:14.856 --> 38:16.490
- Look, this is war.

38:16.491 --> 38:18.058
She's coming after us.

38:18.059 --> 38:21.828
She's dangerous, okay?

38:21.829 --> 38:24.029
- Said man who shot himself
in the butt.

38:32.305 --> 38:34.139
[knocking]

38:35.475 --> 38:37.208
Y.
- [laughing] hey.

38:37.209 --> 38:38.943
So that's the way
it's gonna be, huh?

38:38.944 --> 38:40.177
- I am fine, how are you?

38:40.178 --> 38:42.112
- Don't get me wrong.
I am up for it, okay?

38:42.113 --> 38:43.614
I just wasn't aware
of the ground rules,

38:43.615 --> 38:45.183
Least not the ones you play by.

38:45.184 --> 38:46.184
- Ah, Zimmerman.

38:46.185 --> 38:47.618
- Yeah, zimmern.

38:47.619 --> 38:49.320
You stole my client!

38:49.321 --> 38:50.788
- He called me.

38:50.789 --> 38:53.591
I thought I made it clear that
I was competitive. Remember?

38:53.592 --> 38:55.493
I said, "I'm competitive"?

38:55.494 --> 38:58.429
- Well, as it turns out,
so am I.

38:58.430 --> 38:59.763
- Well, it never would have
worked out anyway,

38:59.764 --> 39:01.765
'cause Zimmerman thinks
that you're too tigh

39:01.766 --> 39:03.200
With his soon-to-be ex-wife.

39:03.201 --> 39:04.868
- I'm worried about Jake
changing doctors, okay?

39:04.869 --> 39:06.036
I mean, I built
a trust with the kid.

39:06.037 --> 39:07.671
- Great, you can fill me in.

39:07.672 --> 39:10.507
Can you explain why someone
wrote all over him?

39:10.508 --> 39:11.875
- What are you...

39:11.876 --> 39:14.311
I can't fight
when you're getting undressed.

39:14.312 --> 39:16.613
- So stop fighting.

39:28.177 --> 39:32.014
[seagulls crying]

39:32.015 --> 39:33.882
- Hi.
-.

39:33.883 --> 39:35.117
- What's this?

39:35.118 --> 39:36.184
- Your money...

39:36.185 --> 39:38.252
For lunch, for hunting.

39:38.253 --> 39:42.023
I put in a little extra,
you know, for getting shot.

39:42.024 --> 39:43.491
- I don't want your money.

39:43.492 --> 39:44.559
- Why not?
You earned it.

39:44.560 --> 39:45.960
- I just don't, okay?

39:48.664 --> 39:51.399
- Can you have dinner
with me next Saturday?

39:51.400 --> 39:52.833
- No, I'm off your payroll.

39:54.069 --> 39:56.838
- Evan, I don't
want to pay you.

39:56.839 --> 39:58.506
I just...

39:58.507 --> 40:00.508
I want to have dinner wi you.

40:00.509 --> 40:03.177
- Oh.

40:03.178 --> 40:06.047
Um...Who's buying?

40:06.048 --> 40:07.181
- You are.

40:07.182 --> 40:09.150
- Good.
- Good.

40:09.151 --> 40:10.685
Pick me up at 8:00?

40:10.686 --> 40:12.020
- Ye, I can do that.

40:15.725 --> 40:17.726
- Can I ask you a question?

40:17.727 --> 40:19.093
- Yeah.

40:19.094 --> 40:21.229
- When we were at lunch
with my parents,

40:21.230 --> 40:24.432
How much of what you said
about me did you mean?

40:24.433 --> 40:26.033
- Like percentage-wi?

40:26.034 --> 40:27.034
- Yeah.

40:27.035 --> 40:28.568
- All of it.

40:36.810 --> 40:39.278
- Hank, I just wanted to say
that you're right.

40:39.279 --> 40:40.612
We should just move forward.

40:40.613 --> 40:42.983
We're not going
to sling mud in the press.

40:42.984 --> 40:44.118
We're just
gonna focus on the work.

40:44.119 --> 40:45.488
- Yeah, no, I'm with you.

40:45.489 --> 40:47.991
- I know,
and I appreciate it so much.

40:47.992 --> 40:49.559
But it's not just you.

40:49.560 --> 40:51.094
Other doctors support me too.

40:51.095 --> 40:53.429
In fact, Emily peck

40:53.430 --> 40:54.965
Said that she
would volunteer her time

40:54.966 --> 40:56.801
To the clinic if I wanted.

41:00.806 --> 41:04.608
- Wow.
That's impressive.

41:04.609 --> 41:07.344
- I also got the results back
from your blood test.

41:07.345 --> 41:08.578
The first time I saw them,

41:08.579 --> 41:10.046
I thought I was ading a typo,

41:10.047 --> 41:12.480
So I had the lab
run it again. Same result.

41:12.481 --> 41:14.348
- I hope this is building up
to good news, Hank.

41:14.349 --> 41:17.317
- Your liver function
test numbers are fantastic.

41:17.318 --> 41:18.986
- Way better than expected.

41:18.987 --> 41:21.488
- The interferon is having
a very positive impact

41:21.489 --> 41:22.955
On your hepatitis.

41:22.956 --> 41:25.392
- Grandpa!
- Hey, buddy, come here.

41:25.393 --> 41:26.728
- Hi, grandpa.

41:26.729 --> 41:29.065
- Hank, this is
my daughter, Mimi.

41:29.066 --> 41:30.667
Mimi, Dr. Lawson.

41:30.668 --> 41:33.237
<i>- The dr, Lawson?
- Yes, nice to meet you.</i>

41:33.238 --> 41:35.372
- Oh, thank you so much
for everything.

41:35.373 --> 41:37.675
Everything you've done
for my father.

41:37.676 --> 41:39.643
Everything
you've done for our family.

41:39.644 --> 41:43.146
I can only imagine
he's not the easiest patient.

41:43.147 --> 41:44.914
- You know, he often tries
to hide his charms,

41:44.915 --> 41:46.015
But I see right through him.

41:46.016 --> 41:47.049
- [chuckles]

41:47.050 --> 41:49.118
- Grandpa, catch!

41:49.119 --> 41:50.652
- Ahh!

41:50.653 --> 41:52.621
- You're lookin' good, dad.
- Thanks, honey.

41:52.622 --> 41:54.858
- I like it.

41:56.527 --> 41:58.429
- Nice work, guys.

41:58.430 --> 42:01.032
- Hey, what's that
on the back of your neck?

42:01.033 --> 42:02.868
- What?

42:02.869 --> 42:03.869
What?

42:03.870 --> 42:06.704
- "poe"?

42:06.705 --> 42:08.206
- What, "property of Evan"?

42:08.207 --> 42:11.141
- No, I think it means
someone se.
