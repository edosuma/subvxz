HELLER: When I agreed
to launder the money
for Townsend,

00:02.903 --> 00:04.505
you said it would
all fly under the radar,

00:04.638 --> 00:07.141
and now I've got the IRS
breathing down my neck.

00:07.275 --> 00:09.577
Have you spoken with
any of your associates
about our arrangement?

00:09.710 --> 00:11.812
Did you hear what I said?
I could go to prison!

00:11.945 --> 00:13.447
Your associates.
Do they know?

00:14.348 --> 00:16.217
Just Charlie.

00:16.350 --> 00:18.786
I had to. He...
He does our accounting.

00:18.919 --> 00:20.054
I don't have
a good feeling
about this.

00:20.188 --> 00:21.422
Do you have
a good feeling
about this?

00:21.555 --> 00:22.790
All I know is

00:22.923 --> 00:24.658
corporate sent
this guy to advise
about the IRS thing.

00:24.792 --> 00:26.460
He's like a consultant.

00:26.594 --> 00:28.096
I'm sure we have nothing
to worry about.

00:28.229 --> 00:29.730
Companies get audited
all the time, right?

00:29.863 --> 00:31.665
Yeah. (CHUCKLES) Right.

00:35.103 --> 00:36.837
All right, I think
we're all set here.

00:38.306 --> 00:40.308
All set?
What's the plan?

00:40.441 --> 00:41.575
You said you were
taking care of this!

00:41.709 --> 00:43.811
Mr. Heller, I've already
taken care of it.

00:43.944 --> 00:46.046
By this time tomorrow,
the audit will be closed.

00:46.814 --> 00:47.815
I don't understand.

00:47.948 --> 00:49.683
If it's taken care of,
why are you here?

00:49.817 --> 00:51.419
To ask you to move away
from the window.

00:53.221 --> 00:55.022
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

00:55.156 --> 00:56.357
Please.
No! No, no!

If you don't mind.

01:05.766 --> 01:06.567
Where's Charlie?

01:07.835 --> 01:08.902
I don't know.
He was just here.

01:09.036 --> 01:10.138
Should we wait for him?

01:10.271 --> 01:11.939
No need.

She graduates from

02:16.470 --> 02:17.238
It's already
been four years?

02:17.371 --> 02:18.306
She wouldn't be there

02:18.439 --> 02:19.473
if it weren't for this one.

02:19.607 --> 02:21.842
Oh, no, no, no, no.
It was all Teva.

02:21.975 --> 02:25.379
Although, I do write
an excellent
recommendation letter.

02:25.513 --> 02:27.080
It's an endangered
talent.

02:27.215 --> 02:29.517
I hope you asked me here
to pay back the favor.

02:29.650 --> 02:31.519
You need something boosted,
tell me where and when,

02:31.652 --> 02:33.053
I'll send me crew.

02:33.187 --> 02:35.523
Thom, rumor has it
your crew does some work

02:35.656 --> 02:36.924
for Neville Townsend.

02:37.057 --> 02:39.960
We freelance for him.
The occasional gig.

02:40.093 --> 02:41.662
He picks the target,
we do the job.

02:41.795 --> 02:43.964
Proceeds
get split 60-40.

02:44.097 --> 02:46.300
Actually, they don't.

02:46.434 --> 02:47.701
What are you
talking about?

02:47.835 --> 02:49.937
Luis Espinoza.
You know him?

02:50.070 --> 02:51.505
Sure. The jobs
I do for Townsend...

02:51.639 --> 02:52.606
He assigns them.

02:52.740 --> 02:55.343
To you and everyone else.

02:55.476 --> 02:58.779
Espinoza manages
all of Townsend's heisting

02:58.912 --> 03:01.014
and boosting,
his capers and pilferage.

03:01.148 --> 03:03.917
He decides which crews
work on which jobs.

03:04.051 --> 03:07.221
Now, you take 40%.

03:07.355 --> 03:10.157
The crews he prefers
to assign take 30%

03:10.291 --> 03:11.792
and kick back 10% to him.

03:11.925 --> 03:14.795
Knowing you to be
a principled thief,

03:14.928 --> 03:17.331
I assume that's not a wheel
you are greasing.

03:17.465 --> 03:18.966
It's not.

03:19.099 --> 03:20.401
Which could explain
why Espinoza

03:20.534 --> 03:22.202
just pulled us off
a job in Berlin.

03:22.336 --> 03:23.604
Our take would've
been seven figures.

03:23.737 --> 03:26.540
10% of which is now
being paid to him

03:26.674 --> 03:28.175
by the crew he sent
in your place.

03:28.309 --> 03:30.244
That sniveling weasel.

03:30.378 --> 03:31.612
Does Townsend
know about this?

03:31.745 --> 03:32.880
I don't believe so.

03:33.013 --> 03:35.283
If he did,
Espinoza would be out.

03:35.416 --> 03:38.151
And here I thought
it was my turn
to do you the favor.

03:54.001 --> 03:55.869
No. Only by reputation.

03:56.003 --> 03:59.006

Careful what you say.

03:59.139 --> 04:02.075
Black shoes, cheap suit,
flat stomach, regulation cut.

04:02.676 --> 04:03.777
Don't get me wrong.

04:03.911 --> 04:06.079
He's bent, just not as bent
as we might like.

04:06.213 --> 04:07.348
I'll be
on my way then.

04:07.481 --> 04:08.682
Safe travels, Thom.

04:10.551 --> 04:12.753
Why must you always
be early?
(DOOR CLOSES)

04:12.886 --> 04:14.955
Why must you only
associate with crooks?

04:15.088 --> 04:17.591
Criminals, Donald,
not crooks.

04:17.725 --> 04:19.560
You can call a prostitute
an escort.

04:19.693 --> 04:20.761
She's still a hooker.

04:21.629 --> 04:23.597
After all these years,

04:23.731 --> 04:25.899
you still see the world
in black and white.

04:26.033 --> 04:27.435
Oh, I see in gray.

04:27.568 --> 04:29.337
I just do my best
to avoid it.

04:29.470 --> 04:31.772
Along with small talk.
You said you had a case.

04:31.905 --> 04:33.341
More like a riddle.

04:33.474 --> 04:36.944
I recently learned that
Townsend laundered money

04:37.077 --> 04:39.713
through a listing agency
called Kelmund Realty.

04:39.847 --> 04:41.782
Unfortunately,
the cooked books

04:41.915 --> 04:44.017
came to the attention
of the IRS.

04:44.151 --> 04:45.453
Sounds pretty fortunate
to me.

04:45.586 --> 04:47.655
If looked at in
black and white.

04:47.788 --> 04:49.523
The gray of it is

04:49.657 --> 04:52.426
72 hours after the IRS gave

04:52.560 --> 04:55.095
Kelmund notice of an audit,

04:55.228 --> 04:56.296
they no longer exist.

04:56.430 --> 04:58.065
They vanished.

04:58.198 --> 05:01.435
The employees,
their accounts,
employment records,

05:01.569 --> 05:04.104
articles of incorporation...

05:04.237 --> 05:05.473
Gone.

05:05.606 --> 05:07.375
Along with the IRS audit.

05:07.508 --> 05:09.943
So, the riddle is how they
pulled off this magic trick.

05:10.077 --> 05:11.379
It's not the how, Donald.

05:11.512 --> 05:12.946
It's the who...

05:13.080 --> 05:15.416
Nicholas Obenrader.

05:15.549 --> 05:17.017
RESSLER: 2009.

05:17.150 --> 05:18.952
Yakuza profits dip during
the Great Recession.

05:19.086 --> 05:20.721
2012.

05:20.854 --> 05:22.890
Brazil's two largest
gangs merge.

05:23.023 --> 05:25.493
2018.

05:25.626 --> 05:28.396
The head of
Le Milieu is assassinated,
creating a power vacuum.

05:28.529 --> 05:31.665
Three continents,
three criminal
enterprises in crisis,

05:31.799 --> 05:32.966
and according
to Reddington,

05:33.100 --> 05:35.803
one common thread...
Nicholas Obenrader.

05:35.936 --> 05:38.672
A management consultant
to criminal organizations.

05:38.806 --> 05:40.708
For the Yakuza,
he rerouted laundered assets

05:40.841 --> 05:42.109
through tax havens
like Ireland.

05:42.242 --> 05:44.545
He was a headhunter for
Le Milieu, and in Brazil,

05:44.678 --> 05:46.046
he oversaw the downsizing

05:46.179 --> 05:47.147
that occurred
after the merger.

05:47.280 --> 05:49.717
How do you downsize
a criminal enterprise?

05:49.850 --> 05:53.787
What, do people get
a golden parachute
or a bullet to the head?

05:53.921 --> 05:56.790
Dump and cover.
We're out of here in 15.

05:59.059 --> 06:02.195
Mr. Obenrader, this is the one
who Becker said got away.

06:04.532 --> 06:07.100
Tell Becker he's fired.
I don't like loose ends.

06:08.636 --> 06:10.771
I'll take care of
this one myself.

06:10.904 --> 06:13.340
RESSLER: Reddington said
that Obenrader's gone
in-house for Townsend.

06:13.474 --> 06:15.008
ARAM: Well, that's why
he gave us this case.

06:15.142 --> 06:18.011
If Townsend hired Obenrader
as his management consultant,

06:18.145 --> 06:20.147
he'll know everything
about his organization.

06:20.280 --> 06:21.381
It's done.

06:21.515 --> 06:23.551
We still have one more
loose end to tie up,

06:23.684 --> 06:26.854
but your IRS problem
is no longer a problem.

06:26.987 --> 06:29.122
Good, because it seems
I may have another problem

06:29.256 --> 06:30.958
I need your help with.

06:31.091 --> 06:35.028
It's come to my attention
that Espinoza may be
feathering his own nest.

06:35.162 --> 06:38.298
If that's true,
I'll be looking
for a replacement.

06:41.001 --> 06:42.903
No. No photos, no prints,
no surveillance.

06:43.036 --> 06:44.171
Obenrader's an alias.

06:44.304 --> 06:46.373
We know what he does,
just not who he is.

Have you read the messages
I gave you?

The ones Reddington
and his handler exchanged
through the Post?

06:58.986 --> 07:00.588
Yes, we all have.

07:00.721 --> 07:02.189
You're on with the team.

07:02.322 --> 07:03.557

Any news on these
mysterious assets?

07:07.861 --> 07:08.829
No.

The messages were urgent

07:10.330 --> 07:11.565
and vague at the same time,

07:11.699 --> 07:13.534
but we were able to
identify an address.

07:13.667 --> 07:15.135
A cafe in Paris.

07:15.268 --> 07:16.436
It was referred to
a couple of times

07:16.570 --> 07:18.639
in past messages
and once again recently.

07:18.772 --> 07:20.774
COOPER: We're hoping to pull
a surveillance image

07:20.908 --> 07:22.976
or maybe get a positive ID
on the handler.

Aram to investigate.

07:34.588 --> 07:37.290
She's really good.

But I think we'll all
be a lot better
when this is done.

the address in Paris?

it would be best

of this ourselves.

in the first place.

I'm the one who got you
the messages to decrypt.

08:00.247 --> 08:02.249
Which is why we shared
with you what they said.

08:02.382 --> 08:03.884
If Aram gets a positive ID

08:04.017 --> 08:05.318
on Reddington's handler,

will you share that
with me, too?

08:06.419 --> 08:07.755
No.

But hopefully,
we'll be able to question him

08:09.857 --> 08:10.858
and find out what he knows.

What he knows is
Reddington is N-13.

he tell us that,

we will take
the appropriate action.

08:17.030 --> 08:19.232
Appropriate action?
Against Reddington?

I think we all know
that's never gonna happen.

It will if he's

the same to Agnes.

why you think this
is a crime scene.

08:38.451 --> 08:40.320
Because two and two
doesn't equal five.
No.

08:40.453 --> 08:42.255
Did they skip out
on the rent?

08:42.389 --> 08:43.957
No. They're paid up for
the next six months.

08:44.091 --> 08:45.458
Did they leave
a forwarding address?

08:45.593 --> 08:46.794
No address,
no phone number.

08:46.927 --> 08:48.461
What bank
was the rent check
drawn from?

08:48.596 --> 08:49.597
They paid cash.

08:49.730 --> 08:51.364
Okay.
So, let's do the math.

08:51.498 --> 08:53.801
They disappear after paying
half a year's rent in cash.

08:53.934 --> 08:56.604
They leave
no forwarding address
or phone number,

18:46.893 --> 18:49.829
So we're clear,
the CIA's filing paperwork

18:49.962 --> 18:51.698
to move you to a black site
if you don't start talking

18:51.831 --> 18:53.900

with Neville Townsend.

(KNOCKS ON DOOR)

18:55.835 --> 18:57.570
Sir, we got a hit.

18:57.704 --> 19:00.473
I enhanced the image
of the man Mr. Reddington
was meeting with in Paris

19:00.607 --> 19:02.141
and ran his face
through the database.

19:02.275 --> 19:05.645
Russia desk kicked him back
as one Ivan Stepanov.

19:05.778 --> 19:07.647
He's SVR?
Officially, yes.

19:07.780 --> 19:09.449
Not so officially,
he's believed to be

19:09.582 --> 19:11.284
a high ranking member
of Zaslon,

19:11.418 --> 19:12.719
running black op
around the globe.

19:12.852 --> 19:14.487
So Keen was right.

19:14.621 --> 19:16.155
Reddington's using
coded messages

19:16.289 --> 19:17.990

clandestine meetings

19:18.124 --> 19:19.792
with a known
Russian intelligence officer.

Not a word.

19:24.931 --> 19:26.933
How was she?
Infuriating.

19:27.066 --> 19:29.336

19:29.469 --> 19:30.803

brought him in.

Harold, I'm afraid
I have to come clean.

I haven't been entirely
forthright with you
on this case,

19:53.493 --> 19:56.629
and I know
we discussed being...

19:57.730 --> 20:00.367
More open and honest
with each other.

20:00.500 --> 20:01.568
We have.

20:01.701 --> 20:03.002
The truth is,

20:03.135 --> 20:07.139
I have no expectation
that Mr. Obenrader will talk,

20:07.274 --> 20:10.510
let alone reveal
any meaningful details

20:10.643 --> 20:14.213
about Townsend
or his organization.

20:14.347 --> 20:20.553
Mr. Obenrader understands
the blowback on his loved ones
would be far too great.

20:20.687 --> 20:21.854
We'll see about that.

20:21.988 --> 20:23.256
Don't...
Uh, hold on, Harold.

20:23.390 --> 20:25.358
I didn't put the man
on your radar

20:25.492 --> 20:26.659

play detective.

20:26.793 --> 20:28.861
I put the man
on your radar

so that you could help me
make a new friend.

20:32.164 --> 20:34.033
And how's that supposed
to happen?

20:34.166 --> 20:36.068
So, we're not only
in bed with Reddington,

20:36.202 --> 20:38.070
but we're also
getting into bed
with Priya Laghari?

20:38.204 --> 20:39.205
That's correct.

20:39.339 --> 20:41.308
Uh, back up.
Who's Priya Laghari?

20:41.441 --> 20:46.313
Only a world renowned thief
who dabbles in jewels and art
and classified intelligence.

20:46.446 --> 20:48.581
COOPER: She's been on
the Bureau's radar for years,

20:48.715 --> 20:50.182
but we've never come close
to catching her.

20:50.317 --> 20:52.619
So, instead of arresting her,
we're gonna work with her.

20:52.752 --> 20:54.053
Why enable
Reddington like this

20:54.186 --> 20:56.022
when he's been
blatantly lying to us?

20:56.155 --> 20:58.224
And not to pile on, sir,
but we did just learn that

20:58.358 --> 21:00.593
Mr. Reddington has been
canoodling with

21:00.727 --> 21:02.228
a Russian intelligence
operative in Paris.

21:02.362 --> 21:04.597
Neville Townsend is
incredibly dangerous,

21:04.731 --> 21:06.399
to the public
and to Elizabeth.

21:06.533 --> 21:08.601
So anything that
gets us closer to him
is a win in my book.

21:08.735 --> 21:10.637
Besides, I'd rather
keep Reddington close

21:10.770 --> 21:13.072
while we look
into his relationship
with Ivan Stepanov.

21:13.205 --> 21:14.674
If he finds out
we're investigating this,

21:14.807 --> 21:16.208
he'll kill the guy
like he killed Rakitin.

21:16.343 --> 21:17.276
Agreed.

21:17.410 --> 21:19.211
So he better not find out.

21:19.346 --> 21:21.381
Or we could just
pull Stepanov off the street.

21:21.514 --> 21:23.049
He's a Russian citizen.

21:23.182 --> 21:24.617
The DOJ's never
going to approve that.

21:24.751 --> 21:27.119
Liz wouldn't need
their approval.

21:27.253 --> 21:30.423

It's a terrible idea that
completely sucks.

21:30.557 --> 21:31.924
We cannot trust her.
She's not an agent.

21:32.058 --> 21:35.161
And abducting
an SVR agent is illegal

21:35.294 --> 21:38.398
and could lead
to a huge scandal
if anyone ever found out.

21:38.531 --> 21:39.732
But just...

21:40.567 --> 21:41.901
Let it suck for a second.

21:43.403 --> 21:44.804
Okay, still sucks.

21:44.937 --> 21:46.773
COOPER: I agree.
It's a terrible idea.

21:46.906 --> 21:50.577
But it's possible that
every other idea is worse.

21:50.710 --> 21:54.481
We can't go through
official channels
to question an SVR agent,

21:54.614 --> 21:56.916
yet we find ourselves
working with a CI

who may be that SVR agent's
top asset in this country.

22:00.252 --> 22:02.121
You said it yourself, Alina,

22:02.254 --> 22:04.323
the minute Reddington
finds out that
we know about Stepanov,

22:04.457 --> 22:05.458
he may kill him,

22:05.592 --> 22:07.360
and try as we might
to keep it from him,

22:07.494 --> 22:09.696
we know that Reddington
will probably find out

22:09.829 --> 22:11.464
what we know.

22:11.598 --> 22:13.099
Which means we have
a narrow window

28:46.525 --> 28:51.563
scratchy, polyester jumpsuits,
bright lights all night,

28:51.697 --> 28:55.267
horrific food,
crushing solitude.

28:55.401 --> 28:56.769
Irrelevance.

28:56.903 --> 28:58.670
I appreciate
what you did,

28:58.805 --> 29:00.306
and I would happily
return the favor

29:00.439 --> 29:02.474
by doing
a thorough overview

29:02.608 --> 29:04.576
of your entire organization
free of charge.

29:04.710 --> 29:08.514
(LAUGHING) Oh, my gosh!
The things you'd find!

29:08.647 --> 29:13.285
Square pegs in round holes,
misfits and outliers.

29:13.419 --> 29:15.321
But you know what?
I like it that way.

29:15.454 --> 29:17.356
I trust how it feels.

29:17.489 --> 29:21.994
The only things I consult
are my gut and my friend.

29:22.128 --> 29:23.930
And why did your gut
tell you to save me?

29:24.063 --> 29:25.697
How do you know
it wasn't my friend?

29:26.332 --> 29:27.599
But I digress.

29:27.733 --> 29:30.602
Neville Townsend asked you
to find someone

29:30.736 --> 29:33.705
to manage the heist crews
he employs.

29:33.840 --> 29:35.041
I have a candidate.

29:35.174 --> 29:36.943
I don't discuss
client business.

29:37.076 --> 29:39.411
I'm sure that
you can appreciate
the need for discretion.

29:39.545 --> 29:41.147
I can, and I do.

29:41.280 --> 29:44.783
But I find myself
in the unusual position

29:44.917 --> 29:47.954
where indiscretion is
the better part of valor.

29:48.087 --> 29:50.422
So allow me
to be indiscrete.

29:50.556 --> 29:52.758
"Spoiler alert,"
as they say.

29:52.892 --> 29:55.727
The boxes contain
an exhaustive

29:55.862 --> 29:58.430
archival record
of your clients.

29:58.564 --> 30:02.034
Names. Dates. Numbers.

30:02.168 --> 30:07.106
A who, what, where, when,
and how of your livelihood.

30:07.239 --> 30:09.108
That's the mystery...

30:09.241 --> 30:10.342
My client list.

30:10.476 --> 30:11.443
It is.

30:11.577 --> 30:15.247
And what I might do
with your client list.

30:17.049 --> 30:18.317
Who's the candidate?

30:18.450 --> 30:19.751
Priya Laghari.

30:19.886 --> 30:20.719
I assume her reputation

30:20.853 --> 30:22.121
precedes her.

30:22.254 --> 30:25.357
The Iranian nuclear deal.
The Matisse in Rotterdam.

30:25.491 --> 30:27.526
(SCOFFS) Normally,
I'd consider myself lucky

30:27.659 --> 30:29.095
to find such
a worthy replacement.

30:29.228 --> 30:30.829
Luck had nothing
to do with it.

30:30.963 --> 30:34.400
I need someone inside
Townsend's organization.

30:34.533 --> 30:38.070
So, I soured him on Espinoza,
Townsend took him out,

30:38.204 --> 30:40.672
called you in,
and here we are.

30:40.806 --> 30:43.309
I consult with Mr. Townsend
about personnel,

30:43.442 --> 30:46.312
avoiding redundancy,
and profit maximization.

30:46.445 --> 30:50.416
I have no interest in
his politics or rivalries,

30:50.549 --> 30:53.252
or in placing a mole
within his organization.

30:53.385 --> 30:55.654
Fine. Then you can volunteer.

30:55.787 --> 30:57.056
(SNIFFLES)

30:57.189 --> 30:59.058
(CHUCKLES) I consult
with Mr. Townsend

30:59.191 --> 31:00.392
virtually
or over the phone.

31:00.526 --> 31:01.493
We've never met.

31:01.627 --> 31:02.962
I don't even know
where he works.

31:03.095 --> 31:04.796
Mm. Miss Laghari then.

31:04.931 --> 31:07.033
Advocate for her

31:07.166 --> 31:09.301
and you can keep
your client list to yourself.

31:13.805 --> 31:16.508
Obenrader raved about her,
and you can see why.

31:16.642 --> 31:18.410
Laghari has
an outstanding resume.

31:18.544 --> 31:20.312
Why are you showing
this to me?

31:21.147 --> 31:22.281
I value your opinion.

31:22.414 --> 31:24.316
About what thief to hire?

31:25.952 --> 31:28.820
We're partners in
going after Reddington,

31:28.955 --> 31:30.156
and when that ends,

31:30.289 --> 31:32.224
I'm hoping our partnership
can continue,

31:32.358 --> 31:33.825
and... And don't...
Don't say no

31:33.960 --> 31:35.661
until you let me show you
more of what I do,

31:35.794 --> 31:37.063
starting with Laghari.

31:37.196 --> 31:38.464
I'd like you to bring her in.

31:38.597 --> 31:40.532
What... Now?

31:40.666 --> 31:42.034
Well, I have a meeting
with someone else.

31:42.168 --> 31:44.336
Excuse me, sir.
I've heard from Vandyke.

31:45.804 --> 31:47.673
The pickup instructions
are in the file.

31:47.806 --> 31:49.408
This is important to me,
Elizabeth.

31:49.541 --> 31:52.044
This person you're
supposed to meet,

31:52.178 --> 31:54.380
is there any chance
you can meet them later?

31:57.016 --> 31:58.184
Of course.

31:59.351 --> 32:01.420
****

32:05.324 --> 32:07.559
Our man in Moscow
has confirmed
Stepanov's location.

32:09.195 --> 32:10.762
I want it done quickly.

32:10.896 --> 32:12.564
I've stalled Keen,

32:12.698 --> 32:14.366
but she may already have
assets on the ground.

32:14.500 --> 32:17.403
What you said,
about briefing her
on what we do,

32:17.536 --> 32:18.404
if she's working
with the FBI...

32:20.072 --> 32:22.508
"If" does me no good.

32:22.641 --> 32:25.211
I need confirmation,
and the best way to get it

32:25.344 --> 32:27.379
is by pretending
to trust her when I don't.

32:29.415 --> 32:31.383
PARK: Remind me again
what we're doing.

32:31.517 --> 32:34.286
We're gonna track Laghari
from her pickup point
to Townsend.

32:34.420 --> 32:35.921
PARK: (OVER RADIO)
And why are we doing that?

32:36.055 --> 32:38.290
Can't Laghari just tell us his
location once she gets there?

32:38.424 --> 32:40.126
After all,
she's spying for us.

32:40.259 --> 32:41.793
RESSLER: No, she's spying
for Reddington.

32:41.927 --> 32:44.730
In exchange for cooperating,
we got Reddington to agree

32:44.863 --> 32:47.733
to let us follow her
to wherever Townsend
works or lives.

32:47.866 --> 32:49.468
****

32:50.969 --> 32:52.171
I have a 20.

32:52.304 --> 32:54.040
East side of the park.
Heading north.

32:54.173 --> 32:55.941
Okay. Here we go.

32:56.075 --> 32:57.409
PARK: What about Keen?

32:57.543 --> 32:59.078
We're working with her
to find Reddington's handler.

32:59.211 --> 33:00.412
Why can't she tell us?

33:00.546 --> 33:01.713
RESSLER: I wish she would,
but she won't.

33:01.847 --> 33:03.949
Not until it's done.
ARAM: What's done?

33:04.083 --> 33:05.084
RESSLER: I wish I knew.

33:36.748 --> 33:38.150
JAX: The blue van.
By the curb.

33:49.695 --> 33:52.664
We got a blue
Chevy Astro van,
7th Street side.

34:04.610 --> 34:06.378
Where am I
supposed to sit?

34:07.346 --> 34:08.480
You're not.

34:18.090 --> 34:19.358
Right this way.

34:23.562 --> 34:24.663
I got the tail.

34:26.332 --> 34:27.666
Hey, you got a signal?

34:27.799 --> 34:29.768
ARAM: Like taking
candy from a kid.

34:29.901 --> 34:31.337
Not that I would
ever do that.

34:31.470 --> 34:33.772
Except once,
I had this mad craving
for a Butterfinger,

34:33.905 --> 34:36.642
but, you know,
it was Halloween, and...

34:36.775 --> 34:37.809
(CELL PHONE RINGS)
...I was a kid, too.

34:39.278 --> 34:40.679
Tell me you're calling
from Moscow.

34:40.812 --> 34:43.682
I am not. I don't know
what's going on.

34:43.815 --> 34:46.152
Townsend sent me
to do something.
It's like he knows.

34:46.285 --> 34:47.719
RESSLER: And what
makes you think that?

34:47.853 --> 34:50.389
LIZ: The job.
It's...make work.

34:50.522 --> 34:52.424
It's a live call.

34:52.558 --> 34:54.893
LIZ: Something you
give someone to keep them
from doing something else.

34:55.026 --> 34:58.597
Okay. Agent Park,
turning west on Clyborne.

34:58.730 --> 34:59.765
You have eyes?

34:59.898 --> 35:01.133
PARK: Copy that.
West on Clyborne.

35:01.267 --> 35:02.534
So, what about Moscow?

35:03.769 --> 35:06.104
I was able to send someone.

35:06.238 --> 35:08.274
ARAM: Looks like
they're coming to a stop.

35:08.407 --> 35:10.442
Keep your distance.

35:10.576 --> 35:11.943
RESSLER: Any word
on the extraction?

35:12.077 --> 35:14.079
No. Shouldn't be a problem.

35:14.213 --> 35:16.548
But if you're right
and Townsend suspects
we're working together...

35:16.682 --> 35:18.250
LIZ: We're not
working together.

35:18.384 --> 35:19.851
We have the same goal.

35:19.985 --> 35:21.086
But so does Townsend.

35:21.220 --> 35:22.954
We're aligned
against Reddington.

35:23.088 --> 35:26.292
Maybe. But if Townsend knew
that we were even talking,

35:26.425 --> 35:28.059
I doubt that he'd be
so understanding.

35:28.194 --> 35:31.129
I'll call you
as soon as I know.

35:31.263 --> 35:34.132
GODWIN: You
wanted confirmation.
You just got it.

35:34.266 --> 35:35.501
She's not wrong.

35:35.634 --> 35:36.868
We're all aligned
against Reddington.

35:37.002 --> 35:38.770
Yeah, but based
on that call,

35:38.904 --> 35:40.972
I'd say she and the feds
are aligned against us.

35:41.106 --> 35:42.708
That's not
what I heard.

35:42.841 --> 35:44.210
Then you
weren't listening.

35:44.343 --> 35:46.612
You think you're giving her
the rope to hang herself.

35:46.745 --> 35:48.814
I fear you may be giving her
the rope to hang all of us.

35:55.254 --> 35:56.455
This was easy.

35:59.925 --> 36:00.926
Or not.

36:01.059 --> 36:02.127
Her driver just left her.

36:02.261 --> 36:03.762
Well, maybe there's
another pickup.

36:03.895 --> 36:05.831
I don't think there's
another pickup.

ARAM: What's going on?
Is she there?

36:19.478 --> 36:21.112
(SIGHS) You were right.

36:21.247 --> 36:23.315
It was like taking candy
from a kid.

36:23.449 --> 36:24.616
Only we were the kids.

36:30.822 --> 36:32.658
Priya Laghari.

36:32.791 --> 36:35.461
I-I feel as if I'm in
the presence of greatness.

36:35.594 --> 36:37.629
Mm. It's a fact,
not a feeling.

36:37.763 --> 36:41.600
May I kiss the ring,
which I assume was
stolen at Cannes?

36:41.733 --> 36:43.001
St. Moritz.

36:43.134 --> 36:45.003
A trophy
that once belonged
to a trophy wife.

36:45.136 --> 36:46.372
Mm.

36:46.505 --> 36:49.341
As touching
as this is to watch,
I'm gonna go.

36:49.475 --> 36:51.042
Of course. Go, go, go.
Oh, oh!

36:51.176 --> 36:52.444
Your appointment.

36:52.578 --> 36:54.112
I hope you were able
to reschedule it.

36:55.614 --> 36:57.583
Turned out not to be
a problem.

36:57.716 --> 36:59.351
I was able
to send someone
in my place.

36:59.485 --> 37:00.752
Were you?
Yeah.

the team in ten.

37:11.363 --> 37:12.831
It'll be done in 20.

37:12.964 --> 37:15.233
Sit tight.
I got this.

37:15.367 --> 37:17.235
That's right.
A hole.

37:17.369 --> 37:18.870
In the floor of the van?

37:19.004 --> 37:21.039
What we don't know
is where or when
she got out.

37:21.172 --> 37:23.241
Which means we're totally
reliant on Reddington.

37:23.375 --> 37:25.877
Whatever Laghari
finds out about Townsend,
she's gonna tell him.

37:26.011 --> 37:27.779
And we're gonna trust
that he turns around
and tells us.

37:27.913 --> 37:30.516
He might.
I mean, normally,
he wouldn't.

37:30.649 --> 37:32.050
I mean, normally,
he's got an agenda

37:32.183 --> 37:33.719
that we do not
know about,

37:33.852 --> 37:36.221
but this time,
we... We want
the same thing.

37:36.355 --> 37:37.956
I think.

37:38.089 --> 37:40.792
If we wanted the same thing,
Reddington wouldn't
have let Obenrader go.

37:40.926 --> 37:42.494
PARK: But if we'd officially
arrested Obenrader,

37:42.628 --> 37:44.029
then it may have
tipped Townsend

37:44.162 --> 37:45.096
that Laghari's a plant.

37:45.230 --> 37:46.865
Maybe when
this is all over,

37:46.998 --> 37:48.867
Mr. Reddington will
circle back to Obenrader.

37:49.000 --> 37:50.902
You know, I'll, uh,
include your optimism

37:51.036 --> 37:52.404
in my debrief to Cooper.

37:54.139 --> 37:55.341
Seriously.

37:55.474 --> 37:56.442
Us and Mr. Reddington,

37:56.575 --> 37:58.109
we are totally in sync
on this, right?

37:58.243 --> 37:59.878
****

38:07.118 --> 38:08.554
We'll hear when we hear.

38:09.588 --> 38:11.723
I know, but why
haven't we heard?

38:11.857 --> 38:13.291
****

38:13.425 --> 38:16.094
Camus thinks
the world is meaningless

38:16.227 --> 38:20.131
and that happiness
comes from accepting
that nothing matters.

38:20.265 --> 38:21.733
He's an Absurdist.

38:21.867 --> 38:25.036
And we live in
a Theater of the Absurd.

38:25.170 --> 38:28.006
Getting the FBI to believe
they helped us insert a spy

38:28.139 --> 38:30.742
when in fact, they helped us
insert an assassin.

38:32.911 --> 38:35.347
LAGHARI: I'm sure
it's not jewels
you're after.

38:35.481 --> 38:37.115
What exactly is it
you want me to steal?

38:37.248 --> 38:38.249
All of it.

38:39.751 --> 38:41.119
That's a lot.

We don't discriminate.
We take what we can.

So, what are
we talking about?

38:53.231 --> 38:55.133
I'm talking about putting
you under contract.

(INDISTINCT WHISPERING)

39:17.222 --> 39:19.324
****

39:19.458 --> 39:20.792
(WHISPERING CONTINUES)

39:27.433 --> 39:30.536
Miss Laghari, it appears
that something has come up.

39:30.669 --> 39:31.803
If you'll excuse me.

39:39.478 --> 39:40.679
Ah!

39:40.812 --> 39:41.747
(GRUNTING)

39:41.880 --> 39:42.814
****

39:44.850 --> 39:46.384
(KNOCK ON DOOR)

39:46.518 --> 39:47.853
I just heard from
the Russia desk.

39:47.986 --> 39:49.621
What is it?
Moscow's lighting up.

39:49.755 --> 39:52.023
Turns out Ivan Stepanov
was abducted

39:52.157 --> 39:53.358
from his apartment
in the Pokrovsky Hills.

39:53.492 --> 39:54.726
Keen.

39:54.860 --> 39:55.627
She must have
gotten to him.

39:55.761 --> 39:57.529
She make contact?
No.

39:57.663 --> 39:59.665
I left her several messages,
but she hasn't picked up.

39:59.798 --> 40:01.733
Let's assume
that's a good thing.

40:01.867 --> 40:03.234
LIZ: I thought
you said it was done.

40:03.368 --> 40:04.736
It was about to be done.

40:04.870 --> 40:06.672
That's when
the place started
swarming with cops.

40:06.805 --> 40:08.039
I can't believe
this is happening.

40:08.173 --> 40:09.708
Not just regular cops.

40:09.841 --> 40:12.578
Someone rang a bell,
and there's all these
important-looking people here.

40:12.711 --> 40:14.045
You got to
get out of there.

40:14.179 --> 40:15.847
You think this might
be the work of your
friends in the FBI?

40:15.981 --> 40:18.183
I have no idea
what to think.

40:18.316 --> 40:20.519
****

40:22.954 --> 40:24.255
Is it done?

40:24.389 --> 40:26.391
I haven't heard
from Laghari,

40:26.525 --> 40:28.093
but I just heard
from Moscow.

40:30.529 --> 40:32.864
What? What happened?

40:34.432 --> 40:35.634
Our friend...

40:37.402 --> 40:38.303
He's been taken.

40:42.774 --> 40:44.776
(ELECTRICITY CRACKLING)

****

41:06.598 --> 41:07.766
TOWNSEND:
Do you know who I am?

41:09.601 --> 41:10.902
Because I know
who you are.

41:12.538 --> 41:15.106
You're the one
who created the archive
that destroyed my family.

41:19.244 --> 41:22.147
I also know you continue
to feed intel to N-13.

41:23.582 --> 41:25.917
Katarina Rostova
was N-13.

41:26.918 --> 41:29.555
And Katarina Rostova
is dead.

41:30.956 --> 41:32.123
Yes,

41:32.257 --> 41:35.126
but Katarina Rostova
was framed.

41:36.762 --> 41:38.129
Which means
I dedicated my life

41:38.263 --> 41:39.598
to the hatred of
an innocent woman.

41:39.731 --> 41:41.833
But you know that.

41:41.967 --> 41:43.935
Just like I know
that you're working
with Reddington.

41:44.069 --> 41:45.503
What I don't know is why.

41:47.238 --> 41:49.507
Why you protect him.
Why you help him.

41:49.641 --> 41:54.913
Why...my family had to die

41:55.046 --> 41:57.148
so that you could
carry out whatever...

41:57.282 --> 41:58.950
Plan you two are hatching.

42:02.654 --> 42:04.189
I have a lot of "whys."

42:08.093 --> 42:11.697
Let's hope you're prepared
to offer some answers.
