I didn't kill him!

26:43.450 --> 26:46.096
Why would I come here alone,
on your turf?

26:46.120 --> 26:48.264

It's not a sacrifice,
it's how we save Jonah.

27:45.820 --> 27:47.431
Yeah, I got the distinct impression

27:47.455 --> 27:48.966
that Constantine was playing catch up

27:48.990 --> 27:50.234
when it came to the kidnapping.

27:50.258 --> 27:51.568
He didn't know the ransom amount.

27:51.592 --> 27:53.036
So Yannick was working on his own

27:53.060 --> 27:54.971
- when he kidnapped Jonah.
- Yeah, it's looking that way.

27:54.995 --> 27:57.006
His father runs the family operation,

27:57.030 --> 27:59.075

27:59.099 --> 28:00.844

28:37.570 --> 28:39.649

28:39.673 --> 28:41.717

28:41.741 --> 28:43.852
But Eric would never do what Travis did.

29:22.581 --> 29:25.026
Yannick's dead. Killed.

In a botched ransom exchange.

29:28.458 --> 29:30.799

quietly and confidentially,

29:30.823 --> 29:32.500

but if we have to involve them...

29:35.827 --> 29:39.073
The Zidarus and my family
hate each other.

29:39.097 --> 29:41.742
The Zidarus killed my great-grandfather

29:41.766 --> 29:44.478
because he had murdered their
great-great-grandfather,

29:44.502 --> 29:46.047
who had murdered their great...

29:46.071 --> 29:48.850
- We get the picture.
- It's stupid.

29:49.563 --> 29:51.418
I wanted no part of it.

29:52.232 --> 29:53.855
Nor did Yannick.

29:54.401 --> 29:55.923

30:00.986 --> 30:02.796
getting by on scraps.

30:02.820 --> 30:04.365
He was mean to Yannick.

30:04.389 --> 30:06.167
Brutal, even.

30:07.038 --> 30:08.668
He wanted to join us.

Hmm. That's what the ransom was for,

30:20.927 --> 30:22.304
to buy in.

30:23.430 --> 30:26.141
I didn't know he was going
to kidnap someone to get it.

30:29.813 --> 30:31.258
He lost a child?

His name was Marcu.

37:45.930 --> 37:48.197
You kidnapped to replace him, didn't you?

37:49.968 --> 37:51.668
A four-year-old boy.

37:53.639 --> 37:57.252
Marcu, here, is that kidnapped
child, Soren.

37:57.276 --> 38:00.970
(SCOFFS) No. No.

38:03.882 --> 38:05.649
- We loved him.
- Prove it.

38:06.752 --> 38:08.442
Give him the truth.

38:08.467 --> 38:10.032
He deserves to know.

38:14.825 --> 38:18.738
My wife was driving.

38:20.898 --> 38:22.710
And blamed herself.

38:22.735 --> 38:24.412
She went into shock.

38:24.437 --> 38:26.287
I thought she wouldn't recover.

38:30.220 --> 38:32.377
I never intended to keep you.

38:33.971 --> 38:36.965
Your real parents were diplomats, rich.

38:37.795 --> 38:40.006
We kidnapped you for the ransom,

38:40.385 --> 38:42.229
but when my wife saw you,

38:42.253 --> 38:44.220
she came alive again.

38:47.225 --> 38:49.292
He's the boy?

38:57.080 --> 38:59.591
I gave you a good life, Marcu.

38:59.616 --> 39:01.572
You are still my son.

39:02.365 --> 39:04.072
My only son.

39:05.142 --> 39:07.687
You told me I was adopted,

39:08.037 --> 39:09.923
not stolen.

39:09.947 --> 39:12.125
You said my parents were dead!

stopped looking for you, Soren.

You were right not to give up on Soren.

40:35.370 --> 40:37.080
You could put his name
in your little book.

40:37.502 --> 40:39.377
Hm. I threw it away.

40:40.296 --> 40:41.546
Hmm.

40:41.570 --> 40:43.748
You know, when I watched you in there,

40:43.772 --> 40:46.773
I realized I could never do it like you.

40:48.083 --> 40:51.595
Huh, I can't even do it like me anymore.

40:51.980 --> 40:54.258
I need to make peace with that.

42:06.411 --> 42:08.111
I don't know.
