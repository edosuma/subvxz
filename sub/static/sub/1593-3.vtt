00:03.421 --> 00:06.037
(snarling )

00:17.810 --> 00:20.643
Gareth: It's probably
pretty stupid to be here.

00:20.813 --> 00:22.769
Dangerous.

00:22.940 --> 00:24.271
I don't know.
Maybe not.

00:24.442 --> 00:25.932
(snarling )

00:28.404 --> 00:31.271
You can see the threat.

00:31.449 --> 00:33.861
That's something.

00:34.035 --> 00:36.947
Looking at them makes me
feel better about things.

00:37.121 --> 00:40.613
My mom used to say that every day
above ground was a win.

00:40.791 --> 00:43.624
Doesn't really apply anymore, but...

00:43.794 --> 00:46.126
you can still get some perspective.

00:52.470 --> 00:55.962
The glass is gonna break
sooner or later.

00:57.683 --> 00:59.799
Nothing lasts too long anymore.

01:03.314 --> 01:04.895
You know,
we marked our way here

01:05.066 --> 01:07.808
so that we could find
our way back after.

01:09.362 --> 01:12.320
So stupid, right?
I mean...

01:12.490 --> 01:14.151
back to what?

01:25.044 --> 01:28.036
It wasn't just a trap.
It was gonna be a choice.

01:28.214 --> 01:31.672
You join us or feed us.

01:33.469 --> 01:35.801
You know...

01:35.972 --> 01:38.054
bears...

01:40.268 --> 01:43.226
when they start to starve,
they eat their young.

01:43.396 --> 01:45.387
If the bear dies,
the cub dies anyway.

01:45.564 --> 01:47.520
But if the bear lives,

01:47.692 --> 01:49.808
it can always have
another cub.

01:54.490 --> 01:56.572
That was part of the pitch.

01:59.245 --> 02:02.157
You know, Greg and Mike
came this close

02:02.331 --> 02:04.071
to nabbing that
grey-haired queen bitch

02:04.250 --> 02:06.286
who killed my mom.

02:06.460 --> 02:08.325
She drove away
with the archer.

02:08.504 --> 02:10.540
Greg saw them pull away.

02:12.216 --> 02:14.047
Can't wait to try her.

02:14.218 --> 02:16.004
I like women better.

02:16.178 --> 02:17.839
Most of us do.

02:18.014 --> 02:20.255
My brother Alex has--

02:20.433 --> 02:23.721
also currently dead
because of Rick--

02:25.646 --> 02:27.887
he had a theory that it
was because

02:28.065 --> 02:29.930
of the extra layer of fat
that women have,

02:30.109 --> 02:32.145
you know,
for childbearing.

02:32.320 --> 02:34.436
Even the skinny girls have it.

02:36.240 --> 02:40.404
Like that pretty one--
Sasha?

02:40.578 --> 02:43.194
I think pretty people
taste better, too.

02:53.591 --> 02:56.207
We're going to get all of them.

02:56.385 --> 02:58.421
But for starters,
you'll do just fine.

02:58.596 --> 03:01.087
We did a good job
on your leg.

03:01.265 --> 03:04.257
- ( sobbing )
- We've had practice.

03:04.435 --> 03:07.598
When we started,
it was about making it slow.

03:09.815 --> 03:13.103
I'm being a human being here.
I'm talking to you.

03:13.277 --> 03:16.064
Perspective, Bob.

03:16.238 --> 03:17.899
You're above ground.

03:18.074 --> 03:19.780
At least you're
better off than them.

03:19.950 --> 03:22.157
(laughing)

03:33.464 --> 03:35.125
Well, he lost it.

03:35.299 --> 03:37.506
Lasted longer than
I thought he would.

03:37.676 --> 03:39.667
(laughing)

03:39.845 --> 03:41.506
You...

03:41.680 --> 03:44.092
you idiots.

03:44.266 --> 03:46.473
- Okay, keep it down.
-( pounding on glass)

03:48.312 --> 03:50.052
I can shut him up.

03:53.651 --> 03:56.484
I've been bitten,
you stupid pricks!

03:57.947 --> 03:59.312
l'm tainted meat.

03:59.490 --> 04:02.357
-( laughing)
- ( spitting)

04:09.834 --> 04:11.870
- Let'sjust kill him now.
- No, no, we need him.

04:12.044 --> 04:13.329
We might as well
be eating one of them.

04:13.504 --> 04:14.664
What the hell's gonna happen?

04:14.839 --> 04:16.170
Are we gonna turn?
Are we just gonna die?

04:16.340 --> 04:18.171
Albert, calm the hell down.
We cooked him.

04:18.342 --> 04:19.798
Everything is gonna be fine.

04:19.969 --> 04:21.505
Why the hell didn't
you check him first?

04:21.679 --> 04:23.294
'Cause he was fine.

04:23.472 --> 04:26.430
- Tainted meat!
- Gareth: Shut up.

04:26.600 --> 04:29.182
- You eating tainted meat!
- I said shut up!

04:33.816 --> 04:35.852
(theme music playing )

05:13.439 --> 05:15.270
(whispering )
Bob.

05:15.441 --> 05:18.023
( panting )

05:26.702 --> 05:28.283
(snarling )

05:28.454 --> 05:29.944
( twig snaps )

05:39.590 --> 05:41.751
- ( snarling )
- ( gasps )

05:45.221 --> 05:46.552
(silenced gunshot)

05:50.142 --> 05:52.929
- ( muffled scream )
- It's me. It's me.

05:54.438 --> 05:56.144
Ty reese.

05:56.315 --> 05:58.351
- He's getting away.
- Who?

05:58.526 --> 06:00.391
Somebody was watching us.

06:00.569 --> 06:02.434
If we go in there now,

06:02.613 --> 06:04.319
some of us aren't coming back.

06:04.490 --> 06:06.105
Bob is out there somewhere.

06:06.283 --> 06:08.695
Scared, alone.

06:08.869 --> 06:10.325
Maybe not alone.

06:10.496 --> 06:12.487
Daryl and Carol are missing, too.

06:19.964 --> 06:21.124
( silverware clattering )

06:21.298 --> 06:22.287
( doors open )

06:34.478 --> 06:36.434
Stop.

06:38.482 --> 06:40.689
What are you doing?

06:45.656 --> 06:48.944
What are you doing?

06:49.118 --> 06:51.905
This is all connected.

06:52.079 --> 06:54.320
You show up,

06:54.498 --> 06:56.705
we're being watched,

06:56.875 --> 07:00.117
and now three of us are gone.

07:03.132 --> 07:05.293
I don't...

07:05.467 --> 07:08.004
I don't have anything
to do with this.

07:09.555 --> 07:10.715
- Wait!
- Rosita: Don't!

07:10.889 --> 07:14.177
- Tyreese: Sasha, put it away.
- Who's out there?

07:14.351 --> 07:16.012
|-- I don't have anything...

07:16.186 --> 07:18.347
- to do with this.
- Where are our people?

07:18.522 --> 07:20.478
- I don't have anything to--
- Where are our people?

07:20.649 --> 07:22.185
Please, I don't have
anything to do with this.

07:29.199 --> 07:30.700
Why'd you bring us here?

07:32.870 --> 07:34.656
Please, |--

07:34.830 --> 07:37.242
You working with someone?

07:37.416 --> 07:39.281
I'm alone. I'm alone.

07:39.460 --> 07:40.791
l was always alone.

07:40.961 --> 07:42.701
What about the woman
in the food bank, Gabriel?

07:42.880 --> 07:45.041
What did you do to her?

07:45.215 --> 07:47.467
"You'll burn for this."

07:47.635 --> 07:49.717
That was for you. Why?

07:49.887 --> 07:51.878
What are you gonna
burn for, Gabriel?

07:52.056 --> 07:54.798
What?
What did you do?

07:54.975 --> 07:57.216
What did you do?

08:02.650 --> 08:04.231
I lock the doors at night.

08:04.401 --> 08:05.732
| always lock
the doors at night.

08:05.903 --> 08:07.689
| always lock the doors
at night.

08:07.863 --> 08:09.728
| always--

08:14.912 --> 08:18.325
They started coming,
my congregation.

08:20.209 --> 08:22.575
Atlanta was bombed the night before
and they were scared.

08:22.753 --> 08:25.085
They were-- they were
looking for a safe place,

08:25.255 --> 08:27.416
a place where they felt safe.

08:30.719 --> 08:33.301
And it was so early.
It was so early.

08:34.598 --> 08:37.180
And the doors were still locked.

08:41.605 --> 08:43.266
You see...

08:46.485 --> 08:48.146
it was my choice.

08:49.947 --> 08:51.357
But there were
so many of them

08:51.532 --> 08:53.944
and they were trying
to pry the shutters

08:54.118 --> 08:56.825
and banging on the sidings,
screaming at me.

08:56.995 --> 08:59.953
And so the dead came for them.

09:02.751 --> 09:04.287
Women...

09:06.964 --> 09:08.249
children.

09:13.679 --> 09:15.635
Entire families calling my name

09:15.806 --> 09:17.762
as they were torn apart,

09:17.933 --> 09:19.594
begging me for mercy.

09:19.768 --> 09:21.975
(sobbing )
Begging me for mercy.

09:23.605 --> 09:25.812
Damning me to hell.

09:30.946 --> 09:33.688
l buried their bones.

09:33.866 --> 09:35.777
l buried it all.

09:43.167 --> 09:46.034
The Lord sent you here
to finally punish me.

09:54.386 --> 09:56.672
l'm damned.

09:57.723 --> 10:00.180
l was damned before.

10:01.852 --> 10:03.513
| always lock the doors.

10:03.687 --> 10:07.179
| always lock the doors.

10:07.357 --> 10:10.315
(sobbing )

10:10.486 --> 10:13.148
(whistling)

10:15.199 --> 10:17.360
Glenn:
There's something--

10:17.534 --> 10:20.401
there's someone outside
lying in the grass.

10:20.579 --> 10:21.659
Sasha.

10:21.830 --> 10:23.536
(walkers snarling )

10:23.707 --> 10:25.698
Oh! Bob!

10:25.876 --> 10:27.537
Bob.

10:29.463 --> 10:30.498
- His leg.
- Get Bob inside.

10:30.672 --> 10:31.661
We'll take care of them.

10:33.550 --> 10:36.212
Can you help me, please?
Help me. Help me.

10:39.556 --> 10:41.547
(gunshot)

10:41.725 --> 10:44.011
Get inside!

10:44.186 --> 10:45.221
Go!

10:57.449 --> 11:00.941
l was in the graveyard.
Somebody knocked me out.

11:01.119 --> 11:03.576
I woke up outside this place.

11:03.747 --> 11:06.864
It looked like a school.

11:07.042 --> 11:11.251
It was that guy, Gareth.

11:11.421 --> 11:13.628
And five other ones.

11:13.799 --> 11:17.758
They were eating my leg
right in front of me,

11:17.928 --> 11:20.670
like it was nothing,

11:20.848 --> 11:24.716
all proud like they
had it all figured out.

11:26.061 --> 11:28.302
Did they have Daryl and Carol?

11:30.941 --> 11:33.057
Gareth said they drove off.

11:35.863 --> 11:37.774
(groaning)

11:37.948 --> 11:39.939
He's in pain.
Do we have anything?

11:40.117 --> 11:42.233
I think there are pill packets
in the first aid kit.

11:42.411 --> 11:44.322
- Yeah.
- Save 'em.

11:44.496 --> 11:46.953
- No.
- Really.

11:51.628 --> 11:52.879
Damn.

12:09.104 --> 12:11.186
lthappened
at the food bank.

12:15.110 --> 12:16.611
It's okay.

12:25.162 --> 12:27.153
Bob?

12:29.875 --> 12:32.867
There's a sofa in my office.

12:34.421 --> 12:36.503
I know it's not much, but...

12:38.508 --> 12:40.169
Thank you.

12:41.178 --> 12:43.089
lgot him.

12:46.266 --> 12:49.349
Do you know the place
Bob was talking about?

12:49.519 --> 12:51.680
It's an elementary school.

12:51.855 --> 12:53.891
- It's close.
- How close?

12:56.860 --> 12:59.351
How close, Gabriel?

13:02.616 --> 13:04.857
It's just a 10-minute walk
through the woods from here,

13:05.035 --> 13:06.900
due south of the graveyard.

13:07.079 --> 13:09.570
(Judith crying)

13:09.748 --> 13:11.739
Shh, shh, shh.

13:13.543 --> 13:15.374
Does he have a fever?

13:15.545 --> 13:17.251
He's just warm.

13:17.422 --> 13:21.415
Jim lasted almost two days
before we left him.

13:23.053 --> 13:25.044
Time for a reality check.

13:25.222 --> 13:27.713
We all need to leave
for DC right now.

13:29.685 --> 13:32.051
Daryl and Carol
are gonna be back.

13:32.229 --> 13:34.060
We're not going
anywhere without them.

13:34.231 --> 13:35.220
I respect that,

13:35.399 --> 13:36.605
but there's a clear
threat here to Eugene.

13:36.775 --> 13:39.141
I need to extract his ass
before things get any uglier.

13:39.319 --> 13:40.934
So if y'all won't come,
good luck to you.

13:41.113 --> 13:43.729
We'll go our separate ways.

13:43.907 --> 13:45.238
You leaving on foot?

13:47.244 --> 13:50.407
We fixed that
damn bus ourselves.

13:50.580 --> 13:52.081
There are a lot more of us.

13:52.249 --> 13:55.366
You want to keep it that way?
You should come.

13:55.544 --> 13:58.081
Carol saved your life.
We saved your life.

13:58.255 --> 14:00.871
Now I am trying to save yours.

14:01.049 --> 14:02.630
Save everyone's.

14:02.801 --> 14:05.042
We're not going anywhere
without our people.

14:05.220 --> 14:07.256
- Your people took off.
- They're coming back.

14:07.431 --> 14:09.012
To what,
picked-over bones?

14:09.182 --> 14:10.797
- You're not taking--
- Do not lay hands!

14:10.976 --> 14:14.889
- Abraham!
- Hey, hey, stop! Now!

14:17.274 --> 14:19.811
Do you really think
that you're gonna be any safer

14:19.985 --> 14:21.976
leaving right now
in the middle of the night?

14:22.154 --> 14:23.815
Yeah.

14:25.282 --> 14:26.613
Yeah.

14:26.783 --> 14:28.739
Glenn:
What about tomorrow?

14:28.910 --> 14:31.037
We need each other for this.

14:31.204 --> 14:33.695
We need each other
to get to DC.

14:33.874 --> 14:36.160
We can get through
all of it together.

14:38.211 --> 14:40.463
l have an idea.

14:44.176 --> 14:45.666
If you stay just
one more day and help,

14:45.844 --> 14:48.677
I'll go with you to DC
no matter what.

14:51.600 --> 14:53.340
Okay?

14:57.105 --> 14:59.141
Glenn and Maggie, too.

14:59.316 --> 15:02.479
- No.
- Good luck, then.

15:02.652 --> 15:05.143
I'm not interested in breaking up
what you have here.

15:06.948 --> 15:08.813
Rosita, grab your gear.

15:08.992 --> 15:10.198
- Abraham--
- Now.

15:10.368 --> 15:13.735
Eugene, let's go.
Eugene.

15:15.165 --> 15:16.996
Move it.

15:17.167 --> 15:19.704
- I don't want to.
- Now.

15:19.878 --> 15:21.493
Okay.

15:33.100 --> 15:34.965
You're not taking the bus.

15:40.148 --> 15:42.013
Try to stop me.

15:52.828 --> 15:54.568
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait!

15:54.746 --> 15:56.486
Hey, hey, hey!

16:00.377 --> 16:01.867
You stay--

16:02.045 --> 16:05.037
you stay and help us,

16:05.215 --> 16:07.206
and we will go with you.

16:07.384 --> 16:09.420
- No.
- It's not your call.

16:13.181 --> 16:15.718
You stay, help us.

16:22.065 --> 16:24.181
Half a day.

16:26.069 --> 16:28.185
Come high noon,
we're taillights.

16:29.739 --> 16:31.991
I'm not waiting for the other
damn shoe to drop.

16:32.159 --> 16:34.571
And we will leave with you.

16:40.750 --> 16:42.615
12 hours.

16:44.713 --> 16:46.419
Then we go.

16:58.643 --> 17:01.555
Bob: You know,
the one good thing

17:01.730 --> 17:04.938
about getting
kicked in my face--

17:06.651 --> 17:09.609
made me forget
the pain in my leg...

17:11.156 --> 17:16.492
and my side,
so two good things.

17:16.661 --> 17:19.073
We're not playing
that game anymore.

17:22.584 --> 17:24.950
Well...

17:25.128 --> 17:27.790
all things considered,

17:27.964 --> 17:31.127
figured you could
humor me a little bit.

17:31.301 --> 17:33.633
( chuckles )

17:39.142 --> 17:42.009
Why didn't you tell me

17:42.187 --> 17:44.143
when it happened?

17:45.649 --> 17:52.145
I knew when I told you,

17:52.322 --> 17:54.813
it'd become
all about the end.

17:58.495 --> 18:01.157
And I really liked the middle.

18:22.978 --> 18:26.470
Rick:
They think they're in control.

18:26.648 --> 18:29.435
We're in here
and they could be anywhere.

18:29.609 --> 18:31.816
But we know exactly
where they are.

18:35.740 --> 18:37.947
Plan's got stones,
I'll give you that.

18:38.118 --> 18:41.201
- Make our move before they do.
- That's right.

18:41.371 --> 18:43.487
They're not counting
on us thinking straight.

18:43.665 --> 18:46.623
Are we?

18:46.793 --> 18:49.910
I'm just making sure.
It's a big play.

18:51.673 --> 18:53.914
Remember what these people
are capable of.

19:00.932 --> 19:03.093
- Tyreese.
- Yeah?

19:04.519 --> 19:06.555
You up for this?

19:08.523 --> 19:10.514
I'm going with you.

19:11.901 --> 19:13.402
You should stay with Bob.

19:13.570 --> 19:16.107
No, I want to be out there.

19:16.281 --> 19:18.442
I want to be a part of this.

19:34.758 --> 19:37.374
I know how it feels.

19:37.552 --> 19:40.589
But this right here,

19:40.764 --> 19:43.471
the time you could
have with him,

19:43.641 --> 19:46.804
you can't throw that away.

19:48.438 --> 19:51.054
lwish I had it with Karen.

19:57.655 --> 20:01.147
Do you remember
how you felt?

20:03.703 --> 20:06.080
What you wanted to do?

20:09.125 --> 20:11.457
Yeah.

20:11.628 --> 20:14.290
It made it so I couldn't see it.

20:16.174 --> 20:18.460
Forgiveness.

20:18.635 --> 20:21.092
That's facing it.

20:21.262 --> 20:23.639
I should forgive them?

20:26.309 --> 20:29.597
For hurting him?
For trying to kill us?

20:30.939 --> 20:33.396
What the hell is wrong with you?

20:33.566 --> 20:35.648
You think we have a choice?

20:35.819 --> 20:38.060
Not all of us.

20:38.238 --> 20:40.320
Just you.

20:41.658 --> 20:43.068
When he opens his eyes,

20:43.243 --> 20:46.110
the only thing he's gonna
want to see is your face.

20:53.002 --> 20:54.993
Take it.

21:01.886 --> 21:04.628
- If he stops breathing...
- Sasha.

21:04.806 --> 21:06.842
...you put it through his temple.

21:10.728 --> 21:13.060
That's what Bob would want.

21:41.968 --> 21:42.957
( lock clicks)

21:43.136 --> 21:45.127
(tapping )

21:49.517 --> 21:53.681
(walkers snarling )

23:38.459 --> 23:40.950
Gareth: Well, I guess
you know we're here.

23:44.340 --> 23:48.800
And we know you're here.

23:53.141 --> 23:55.132
And we're armed.

23:57.979 --> 24:00.345
So there's really no point
in hiding anymore.

24:12.577 --> 24:14.363
We've been watching you.

24:17.540 --> 24:19.656
We know who's here.

24:22.253 --> 24:26.041
There's Bob,

24:26.215 --> 24:28.797
unless you've put him
out of his misery already.

24:30.720 --> 24:32.631
And Eugene.

24:34.599 --> 24:36.635
Rosita.

24:36.809 --> 24:40.017
Martin's good friend Tyreese.

24:42.857 --> 24:44.722
Carl.

24:50.365 --> 24:52.196
Judith.

24:55.078 --> 24:58.070
Rick and the rest walked out

24:58.247 --> 25:00.863
with a lot of your guns.

25:08.633 --> 25:10.248
Listen, we don't know
where you all are,

25:10.426 --> 25:12.417
but this isn't a big place.

25:17.266 --> 25:18.881
So let's just stop this now

25:19.060 --> 25:21.426
before things get more painful
than they need to be.

25:33.950 --> 25:36.111
( rattling )

25:47.964 --> 25:49.750
Look, you're behind
one of these two doors

25:49.924 --> 25:52.131
and we have more than enough
firepower to take down both.

25:52.301 --> 25:54.792
Can't imagine that's
what you all want.

25:54.971 --> 25:57.428
(cocks gun)

26:01.185 --> 26:03.346
How about the priest?

26:08.568 --> 26:10.058
Father, you help us
wrap this up,

26:10.236 --> 26:12.397
we'll let you walk away
from this.

26:17.994 --> 26:19.404
Just open the door
and you can go.

26:19.579 --> 26:21.490
You can take
the baby with you.

26:24.584 --> 26:26.165
What do you say?

26:33.676 --> 26:36.509
(Judith crying)

26:40.767 --> 26:43.008
I don't know.
Maybe we'll keep the kid.

26:43.186 --> 26:45.017
I'm starting to like this girl.

26:49.817 --> 26:51.353
It's your last chance right now

26:51.527 --> 26:52.812
to tell us you're coming out.

26:56.866 --> 26:59.027
Are we done?

27:02.872 --> 27:04.703
We'll hit the hinges.

27:04.874 --> 27:06.990
(silenced gunshots)

27:10.213 --> 27:12.204
Rick:
Put your guns on the floor.

27:12.381 --> 27:14.417
Rick, we'll fire right into that office.
So you lower your gun--

27:14.592 --> 27:17.459
- ( silenced gunshot)
- Ah!

27:17.637 --> 27:21.050
(whimpering)

27:26.604 --> 27:29.141
Putyourguns
on the floor and kneel.

27:30.900 --> 27:33.061
Do what he says.

27:40.409 --> 27:42.445
Martin, there's no choice here.

27:43.913 --> 27:45.574
Yeah, there is.

27:46.916 --> 27:48.781
Want to bet?

27:53.756 --> 27:56.623
( Gareth gasping )

28:19.657 --> 28:21.693
No point in begging, right?

28:24.287 --> 28:25.948
No.

28:28.457 --> 28:30.038
Still, you could have
killed us when you came in.

28:30.209 --> 28:31.710
There had to be
a reason for that.

28:33.462 --> 28:35.293
We didn't want
to waste the bullets.

28:40.511 --> 28:42.217
We used to help people.

28:42.388 --> 28:44.629
We saved people.

28:46.851 --> 28:50.093
Things changed.
They came in and--

28:50.271 --> 28:52.557
( groans )

28:58.529 --> 29:00.815
After that...

29:05.995 --> 29:07.485
I know that
you've been out there,

29:07.663 --> 29:09.619
but I can see it.

29:09.790 --> 29:13.078
You don't know
what it is to be hungry.

29:18.174 --> 29:19.505
You don't have to do this.

29:19.675 --> 29:22.166
We can walk away,

29:22.345 --> 29:25.132
and we will never
cross paths again.

29:25.306 --> 29:27.012
I promise you.

29:28.559 --> 29:30.845
But you'll cross someone's path.

29:35.399 --> 29:40.439
You'd do this to anyone, right?

29:40.613 --> 29:42.695
Besides,

29:42.865 --> 29:46.198
I already made you
a promise.

29:46.369 --> 29:47.984
No!

29:53.542 --> 29:56.534
( people screaming )

30:39.422 --> 30:41.458
It could have been us.

30:57.815 --> 30:59.601
Yeah.

31:30.723 --> 31:32.463
This is the Lord's house.

31:33.851 --> 31:36.342
No.

31:36.520 --> 31:38.806
It's just four walls and a roof.

31:47.656 --> 31:50.238
You'll always be with us.

31:50.409 --> 31:52.149
Part of us.

32:06.634 --> 32:08.590
Rick.

32:10.304 --> 32:12.590
No, don't.

32:12.765 --> 32:14.847
Let her stay.

32:15.017 --> 32:17.349
I trust her.

32:21.524 --> 32:23.355
I'm right outside.

32:29.156 --> 32:31.147
| just want to say thank you.

32:31.325 --> 32:33.782
For what?

32:33.953 --> 32:36.114
Before the prison,

32:36.288 --> 32:39.655
I didn't know if there were
any good people left.

32:41.794 --> 32:44.501
I didn't know
if anybody was left.

32:48.509 --> 32:51.216
You took me in.

32:52.721 --> 32:55.554
'Cause you took people in.

32:58.227 --> 33:00.218
It was you, man.

33:05.401 --> 33:08.564
What I said yesterday,

33:08.737 --> 33:10.728
I ain't revising it.

33:12.908 --> 33:16.366
Even in light
of current events.

33:19.165 --> 33:21.656
Nightmares end.

33:23.377 --> 33:26.540
They shouldn't end
who you are.

33:30.342 --> 33:34.927
And that is just
this dead man's opinion.

33:41.854 --> 33:43.515
I'll take it.

33:46.358 --> 33:48.940
( chuckles )

33:49.111 --> 33:51.102
Just look at her

33:51.280 --> 33:54.192
and tell me the world
isn't gonna change.

34:04.960 --> 34:08.202
( raspy breathing )

34:16.472 --> 34:18.133
You were out.

34:18.307 --> 34:19.797
Hmm.

34:19.975 --> 34:21.636
Was I?

34:21.810 --> 34:23.801
You were.

34:27.733 --> 34:30.475
Why are you smiling?

34:30.653 --> 34:32.814
lthink l was dreaming.

34:32.988 --> 34:37.823
And lthink you

34:37.993 --> 34:41.076
were smiling back
at me in the dream.

34:42.539 --> 34:44.996
Yeah, that's it.

34:52.007 --> 34:54.089
So what is it?

34:56.637 --> 34:59.800
The good that comes
out of this bad?

35:11.735 --> 35:13.771
Bob?

35:19.118 --> 35:20.904
Bob?

35:23.789 --> 35:26.451
(sobbing )

36:03.912 --> 36:05.368
Give it here.

36:20.971 --> 36:22.711
You step out.

36:24.600 --> 36:26.090
Okay?

36:31.774 --> 36:33.730
( door opens)

36:36.195 --> 36:37.685
( door closes)

36:47.581 --> 36:49.867
( breathing heavily )

36:58.300 --> 37:00.882
( squelches )

37:22.324 --> 37:24.315
This is our route to DC.

37:24.493 --> 37:26.154
We'll stick to it
as long as we're able.

37:26.328 --> 37:29.616
If not, well,
you got our destination.

37:29.790 --> 37:32.657
Once Eugene gets
to the big brains left up there,

37:32.835 --> 37:34.450
things are gonna bounce back.

37:34.628 --> 37:37.335
This group should be there for it.

37:40.008 --> 37:42.499
You should be there for it.

37:42.678 --> 37:44.009
They will be.

37:44.179 --> 37:46.135
We will.

37:48.308 --> 37:49.809
We will.

37:54.356 --> 37:56.221
Let's go.

38:51.580 --> 38:54.492
(shovel striking dirt)

39:32.454 --> 39:34.740
lneverasked
how it was for you

39:34.915 --> 39:37.281
getting to Terminus.

39:47.553 --> 39:49.544
lt killed me.

40:08.115 --> 40:09.730
No, it didn't.

40:24.131 --> 40:25.621
( door opens)

40:34.683 --> 40:36.639
I can't sleep.

40:48.655 --> 40:50.816
And now,
sitting in there...

40:52.534 --> 40:54.320
Quiet.

41:01.877 --> 41:04.368
It isn't just what
happened last night.

41:06.882 --> 41:09.043
Saying what happened before...

41:12.137 --> 41:13.718
out loud...

41:17.225 --> 41:19.011
| see it all again.

41:21.188 --> 41:22.803
I hear them.

41:22.981 --> 41:24.517
Yeah.

41:25.567 --> 41:27.353
That won't stop.

41:31.948 --> 41:34.109
But it won't be all the time.

41:34.284 --> 41:36.491
( rustling )

42:22.082 --> 42:23.947
Michonne:
Where's Carol?

42:28.088 --> 42:29.294
Come on out.

42:33.135 --> 42:35.751
(theme music playing )
