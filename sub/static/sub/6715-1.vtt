00:57.200 --> 00:59.199
Dario!

00:59.200 --> 01:01.200
A message from Peligro.

01:08.400 --> 01:10.200
Ho!

01:28.400 --> 01:31.200
Mambo, Mambo, Mambo, Mambo.

01:31.300 --> 01:33.200
Mambo, Mambo, Mambo, Mambo.

01:33.300 --> 01:35.300
Mambo, Mambo, Mambo, Mambo.

01:36.200 --> 01:38.200
Mambo, Mambo, Mambo, Mambo.

02:38.400 --> 02:41.300
Mambo, Mambo, Mambo, Mambo.

02:41.400 --> 02:43.300
Mambo, Mambo, Mambo, Mambo.

02:43.400 --> 02:45.399
Mambo, Mambo, Mambo, Mambo.

02:45.400 --> 02:48.200
Mambo, Mambo, Mambo, Mambo.

02:57.300 --> 02:59.300
Mambo, Mambo, Mambo, Mambo.

02:59.400 --> 03:01.399
Mambo, Mambo, Mambo, Mambo.

03:01.400 --> 03:04.199
Mambo, Mambo, Mambo, Mambo.

03:04.200 --> 03:06.300
Mambo, Mambo, Mambo, Mambo.

03:14.400 --> 03:16.300
Mambo.

03:22.300 --> 03:24.400
Ladies and gentlemen,

03:24.500 --> 03:27.300
a very good evening to you all.

03:27.400 --> 03:29.300
El Tropico,

03:29.400 --> 03:32.199
the most fabulous nightclub
in the World, presents

03:32.200 --> 03:35.199
its latest, but not late show,

03:35.200 --> 03:37.299
Where we are taking you all
to the magical productions

03:37.300 --> 03:40.300
of our Rodney the Great.

03:43.400 --> 03:44.400
Ladies and gentlemen,

03:44.401 --> 03:46.400
We are honored tonight
to have in our presence

03:47.200 --> 03:49.200
the World's greatest
living race car driver,

03:49.300 --> 03:51.500
here in Cuba for the
first Havana Grand Prix.

03:52.300 --> 03:53.300
Ladies and gentlemen,

03:53.301 --> 03:56.400
the one and only Fangio
for once, stationary.

03:56.500 --> 04:00.399
Fangio! Fangio! Fangio! Fangio!

04:00.400 --> 04:02.299
Fangio!

04:02.300 --> 04:05.300
And now, a special treat

04:05.500 --> 04:07.400
for a very special couple.

04:07.500 --> 04:09.299
Forever newlyweds,

04:09.300 --> 04:12.400
Dona Cecilia, Don Federico,

04:13.200 --> 04:15.300
The Anniversary Waltz by Strauss.

04:15.400 --> 04:18.399
Happy Anniversary.

04:26.200 --> 04:26.500
A toast.

04:27.300 --> 04:29.200
To the most elegant couple in Havana.

04:29.300 --> 04:30.200
Happy Anniversary.

04:30.300 --> 04:31.300
And to this,

04:31.400 --> 04:33.300
the happiest of families.

04:33.400 --> 04:35.299
May it be that way forever.

04:35.300 --> 04:37.299
Hear, hear. Salud.

04:37.300 --> 04:38.500
Salud. Salud.

04:41.300 --> 04:43.499
Dance with me, as you once did?

04:43.500 --> 04:46.200
You make me sound like a relic.

04:46.300 --> 04:49.300
My relic.

04:50.300 --> 04:52.400
Donoso, would you dance with me?

04:53.200 --> 04:54.200
Watch yourself.

04:54.400 --> 04:56.200
Uncle has two left feet now.

04:56.300 --> 04:57.399
His elbow, it works fine.

04:57.400 --> 05:01.399
I would give an arm and
a leg and an elbow

05:01.400 --> 05:04.299
for just one single waltz.

05:04.300 --> 05:09.200
My kingdom for a cha-cha-cha!

05:09.300 --> 05:10.300
Hear, hear.

05:10.301 --> 05:12.400
Let's go dance.

05:13.500 --> 05:16.400
I'll be right back. Wait here.

05:24.400 --> 05:25.400
What's wrong?

05:27.400 --> 05:30.299
So which one of those dancers

05:30.300 --> 05:31.300
is your girlfriend this week?

05:34.300 --> 05:36.300
Who are you saving yourself for?

05:36.400 --> 05:38.299
No one.

05:38.300 --> 05:40.300
All the good ones are already spoken for.

05:42.400 --> 05:43.300
Fangio, I want to present to you

05:43.400 --> 05:45.300
my wife Mercedes Fellove.

05:54.200 --> 05:55.400
Come on, let's go.

05:59.500 --> 06:04.199
This meeting was my idea...

06:04.200 --> 06:08.400
because these are very
difficult times, as you know.

06:08.500 --> 06:10.399
Cuba has always lived in difficult times,

06:10.400 --> 06:13.399
but through them all, we
have been able to survive

06:13.400 --> 06:18.299
because we have always been united.

06:18.300 --> 06:21.299
But our country isn't safe anymore,

06:21.300 --> 06:24.400
and it threatens us.

06:24.500 --> 06:30.200
Your uncle and I are all that
remains of our generation.

06:32.300 --> 06:37.499
So, my sons, you are the future.

06:37.500 --> 06:40.200
The future of our family.

06:40.400 --> 06:42.200
The future of this island.

06:42.400 --> 06:46.299
Yes, and look at me.

06:46.300 --> 06:48.300
Look at me, because this is for you, too.

06:48.400 --> 06:51.299
If we want to change the status quo,

06:51.300 --> 06:55.300
we must go about it in a democratic way.

06:55.400 --> 06:56.499
You hear?

06:56.500 --> 06:58.399
We must be patriots.

06:58.400 --> 06:59.400
Patriots.

07:00.200 --> 07:02.399
Patriotism is a refuge for scoundrels.

07:02.400 --> 07:04.199
Do you

07:04.200 --> 07:05.299
Lt is politics that has become

07:05.300 --> 07:07.299
the practical refuge of.

07:07.300 --> 07:08.499
Papi, do not make the mistake

07:08.500 --> 07:10.299
of confusing me for one of your students.

07:10.300 --> 07:11.300
I'm not. I graduated.

07:11.300 --> 07:12.300
Hey.

07:12.301 --> 07:15.299
Show a little respect.

07:15.300 --> 07:17.399
No, no, no, no. Let him talk.

07:17.400 --> 07:20.299
Let him talk. This is a democracy.

07:20.300 --> 07:23.199
Oh, this country, a democracy? Right.

07:23.200 --> 07:25.399
Our family is a democracy.

07:25.400 --> 07:27.399
This country is my family,

07:27.400 --> 07:30.300
and the only way to
truly unite that family

07:30.400 --> 07:31.400
is revolution.

07:31.500 --> 07:32.400
Revolution?

07:33.300 --> 07:34.200
Revolution, yes.

07:34.400 --> 07:36.399
I just can't believe it.

07:36.400 --> 07:39.299
A son of mine that would support

07:39.300 --> 07:41.499
the random violence of revolution?

07:41.500 --> 07:43.400
You better start believing it.

07:43.500 --> 07:46.299
What you need is a little evolution,

07:46.300 --> 07:47.300
not revolution.

07:47.301 --> 07:48.399
Correct.

07:48.400 --> 07:50.399
The poet.

07:50.400 --> 07:52.200
Club owner, poet.

07:52.400 --> 07:54.299
You're lucky you're on the
other side of the room.

07:54.300 --> 07:55.300
I feel lucky,

07:55.301 --> 07:57.300
because it probably stinks
on that side of the room.

07:57.400 --> 07:58.200
Please.

07:58.400 --> 07:59.200
Happy Anniversary.

07:59.400 --> 08:00.400
You are too much.

08:00.401 --> 08:02.199
Did I forget to say that?
Happy Anniversary?

08:02.200 --> 08:03.399
Just watch your mouth.

08:03.400 --> 08:05.499
What? You've been watching
it the whole time.

08:05.500 --> 08:07.400
If I hear one more word of disrespect

08:07.500 --> 08:09.300
coming out of your mouth,

08:09.400 --> 08:11.499
I'm gonna deal with it personally.

08:11.500 --> 08:13.299
Do you understand me?

08:13.300 --> 08:14.200
What?

08:14.400 --> 08:16.199
You understand what I just said to you?

08:16.200 --> 08:17.200
I understand.

08:17.300 --> 08:19.299
You listen to your father
when he's speaking to you,

08:19.300 --> 08:20.400
and you show respect!

08:20.500 --> 08:21.400
Calm down, Fico.

08:21.400 --> 08:22.400
No, you calm down!

08:23.300 --> 08:24.399
Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay.

08:24.400 --> 08:26.399
You want me to come over there?

08:26.400 --> 08:27.400
Okay.

08:27.401 --> 08:29.200
Huh? You want me to come over there?

08:31.200 --> 08:32.200
Stop it!

08:32.201 --> 08:33.400
Come on. Come on.

08:35.400 --> 08:38.200
Stop it! Stop it.

08:38.299 --> 08:40.399
Four against one, huh? Stop it.

08:40.400 --> 08:41.400
Sit down. Sit down.

08:41.400 --> 08:42.400
Is this a democracy?

08:42.400 --> 08:43.400
Sit down.

08:43.400 --> 08:45.399
You got your little show. Sit down.

08:45.400 --> 08:48.399
Sit down, right? How is it? Sit down!

08:48.400 --> 08:50.400
Is this a random act of violence, Papi?

08:51.200 --> 08:52.400
Huh?

08:58.500 --> 08:59.500
They shot Lieutenant Dario.

09:00.300 --> 09:02.300
Did they get good descriptions this time?

09:04.300 --> 09:06.199
Did he mention Peligro again?

09:06.200 --> 09:07.300
Mm-hmm.

09:10.400 --> 09:12.199
What happened?

09:12.200 --> 09:14.300
I'm not gonna have this conversation.

09:14.400 --> 09:16.199
With you, you, you, or any of you.

09:16.200 --> 09:17.300
You know what?

09:17.400 --> 09:19.199
You have no idea What's
going on in this country.

09:19.200 --> 09:21.200
It's sad that you're a
professor and you have zero

09:21.300 --> 09:24.299
zero idea of what is going
on in your own classroom.

09:24.300 --> 09:26.299
Then can you enlighten me?

09:26.300 --> 09:28.299
Can you tell me what's going on?

09:28.300 --> 09:32.400
Discontent, anger... desperation.

09:32.500 --> 09:34.400
That's what's going on in this country,

09:35.300 --> 09:36.200
everywhere in this country,

09:36.300 --> 09:38.199
and especially at your university.

09:38.200 --> 09:40.300
Revolution, okay? Lt happened in
France, it happened in Russia,

09:40.400 --> 09:42.200
and it's happening here,
and it's happening now.

09:42.300 --> 09:44.300
Nobody wants a revolution.

09:44.400 --> 09:45.400
You don't want a revolution.

09:46.200 --> 09:48.200
But like it or not, it's coming.

09:48.300 --> 09:50.400
The people, they want it.

09:50.500 --> 09:52.300
How do you know?

09:52.400 --> 09:55.300
Has the people of Cuba spoken
to you in your chosen ears?

09:55.400 --> 09:58.399
No. Batista must be eliminated.

09:58.400 --> 10:00.200
And then what?

10:00.300 --> 10:02.499
Freedom. Democracy.

10:02.500 --> 10:03.500
Right, yeah.

10:03.500 --> 10:04.500
Power to the people.

10:04.500 --> 10:05.500
That's easier said than done.

10:05.500 --> 10:06.400
It can be done,

10:07.300 --> 10:08.400
but the first thing you have to do

10:09.200 --> 10:10.400
is kill that son of a bitch.

10:10.500 --> 10:11.500
Kill, kill, kill, kill, kill.

10:12.300 --> 10:16.200
Have you ever thought to
live for your country?

10:16.300 --> 10:19.199
Yes. Live. I am living!

10:19.200 --> 10:21.199
I live, and I let die.

10:21.200 --> 10:22.400
Let the tyrant die.

10:23.200 --> 10:24.500
A fish is caught by its mouth.

10:25.300 --> 10:30.199
You need the earth on
your hands, not blood.

10:30.200 --> 10:32.200
Take sanctuary at the farm.

10:32.300 --> 10:35.300
My son doesn't need sanctuary.

10:35.400 --> 10:38.299
He just needs to reform his character,

10:38.300 --> 10:43.200
for a man's character is his destiny.

10:43.300 --> 10:44.300
What book did you get that from?

10:44.500 --> 10:45.500
Maybe you should read a couple.

10:46.300 --> 10:47.200
Where do you stand, Fico?

10:47.300 --> 10:49.500
Where do you stand?

10:50.300 --> 10:51.300
Right here with my family.

10:51.301 --> 10:53.399
I see that. You're just a spectator.

10:53.400 --> 10:55.299
You just watch the parade go by.

10:55.300 --> 10:57.199
Let me tell you something, Fico.

10:57.200 --> 10:59.399
Your days of hiding in this
cork-lined palace are numbered.

10:59.400 --> 11:02.200
Pretty soon, you and you and you

11:02.300 --> 11:04.300
and you are gonna have
to make a decision.

11:04.400 --> 11:06.300
Are you in the parade, or are you not?

11:06.400 --> 11:08.400
I have made my decision.

11:11.300 --> 11:12.200
That means good night!

11:12.300 --> 11:14.200
Good night in Cuban!

11:14.400 --> 11:17.200
Buenas noches!

11:17.300 --> 11:20.200
Buenas noches to you all!

12:00.300 --> 12:02.400
Good evening.

12:03.300 --> 12:04.400
That depends.

12:06.300 --> 12:09.200
It usually does, doesn't it?

12:11.400 --> 12:13.400
It was a great show tonight.

12:17.300 --> 12:18.400
Great show.

12:25.300 --> 12:28.300
Do you know a guy named Peligro?

12:28.400 --> 12:31.299
Who?

12:31.300 --> 12:33.400
Peligro.

12:34.300 --> 12:36.400
Is he a percussionist?

12:44.300 --> 12:47.199
Would you know a guy named Alberto Mora?

12:47.200 --> 12:48.200
Is he a friend of yours?

12:48.400 --> 12:50.300
Someone here to see you.

12:55.400 --> 12:57.400
I had nowhere else to go.

13:00.300 --> 13:01.300
Have you seen him?

13:02.500 --> 13:04.400
All the time.

13:12.500 --> 13:16.200
Next time you see him, say good-bye.

13:24.400 --> 13:25.499
When I get to the pearly gates,

13:25.500 --> 13:28.399
you know what I'm gonna
ask for, don't you?

13:28.400 --> 13:30.399
A bottle of Bacardi? No, a case.

13:30.400 --> 13:32.199
Don't forget the Victrola.

13:32.200 --> 13:33.399
You're not going anywhere
without your dance partner.

13:33.400 --> 13:34.400
Okay, I'll stay.

13:39.400 --> 13:40.500
Viejo. What is he saying?

13:41.200 --> 13:42.400
Uh-oh, the ticking clock.

13:43.200 --> 13:44.400
Fico.

13:51.300 --> 13:55.300
Well, I wanted to say that in our house,

13:55.400 --> 13:57.300
Sunday dinner is not...

13:57.400 --> 13:59.299
A moveable feast.

13:59.300 --> 14:04.300
Uh-huh. All my sons are
welcome, but not...

14:04.400 --> 14:06.199
Not after6.

14:06.200 --> 14:09.399
And it is 6 and 3 minutes, Fico.

14:09.400 --> 14:11.300
I know, but I thought he said after6.

14:13.300 --> 14:16.399
Okay. Okay. Now, um...

14:16.400 --> 14:20.199
I want to make a wish.

14:20.200 --> 14:24.299
If change is going to
come to our country,

14:24.300 --> 14:29.200
I wish that our home remains an island,

14:29.400 --> 14:35.299
and that despite all of our differences,

14:35.300 --> 14:38.300
we always put family first.

14:40.300 --> 14:43.200
And food second.

14:43.400 --> 14:44.400
Salud. Salud.

14:44.401 --> 14:47.300
It's a joke, my brother.
I'm just kidding.

14:57.300 --> 14:59.200
So it's all in the family.

14:59.300 --> 15:00.300
It's all in the family.

15:00.301 --> 15:02.300
I tell you, I swear to God it is.

15:02.400 --> 15:05.399
Hello, Senator. How are you?

15:05.400 --> 15:07.399
I've been better.

15:07.400 --> 15:09.399
I come to see your father.

15:09.400 --> 15:12.299
No one knows more about
constitutional law.

15:12.300 --> 15:14.299
Am I interrupting?

15:14.300 --> 15:16.400
I mean, he's picking for
compliments, Senator.

15:17.300 --> 15:18.300
Okay, I'm gonna give you one.

15:18.400 --> 15:20.399
Do you think the light
interrupts the day?

15:20.400 --> 15:21.400
Sometimes.

15:21.401 --> 15:24.299
We intend to pass a resolution

15:24.300 --> 15:25.400
that will remove Batista

15:26.300 --> 15:29.399
through the constitutional process.

15:29.400 --> 15:31.199
Senator Cossio has asked me

15:31.200 --> 15:33.200
to prepare a speech for him.

15:33.300 --> 15:35.400
This is the opening statement.

15:36.300 --> 15:40.299
Uh, I've made reference to Seneca.

15:40.300 --> 15:41.300
Read it aloud, Senator,

15:41.301 --> 15:44.399
so we can hear how it sounds.

15:44.400 --> 15:47.399
Okay. Please.

15:47.400 --> 15:53.199
Mr. Speaker, I must protest...

15:53.200 --> 15:56.299
as Seneca did in ancient Rome,

15:56.300 --> 15:59.500
of the violence of office.

16:00.300 --> 16:03.399
Today, we, the citizens of Cuba,

16:03.400 --> 16:05.400
are being persecuted by a tyrant

16:06.300 --> 16:07.399
and his reign of terror,

16:07.400 --> 16:11.300
meted out to our
population by his police,

16:11.400 --> 16:15.299
and especially by a certain
colonel in the force.

16:15.300 --> 16:20.299
Whose name has become
synonymous with sudden death.

16:20.300 --> 16:24.299
Seneca was persecuted by two tyrants,

16:24.300 --> 16:27.300
Caligula and Nero.

16:27.400 --> 16:29.200
In spite of that,

16:29.300 --> 16:32.400
Seneca advocated the
return to the Republic...

16:33.200 --> 16:35.399
unafraid.

16:35.400 --> 16:40.400
Mr. Speaker, Seneca, not
the Neros of this world,

16:41.300 --> 16:44.500
should be an example to us.

16:57.200 --> 16:59.399
Fangio, I am your biggest fan.

16:59.400 --> 17:02.199
Get in the car. Just get in the car.

17:02.200 --> 17:03.399
Get in the car. Get in.

17:03.400 --> 17:06.199
What do you want? Money?

17:06.200 --> 17:07.200
Publicity.

17:09.400 --> 17:11.398
Fangio freed, Grand Prix cancelled,

17:11.400 --> 17:13.400
26th of July Movement responsible.

17:14.200 --> 17:15.398
And listen to what Fangio said.

17:15.400 --> 17:16.300
All they wanted from me

17:16.400 --> 17:18.400
is that I help them further their cause.

17:18.500 --> 17:22.300
But I don't know anything
about causes, only cars.

17:22.500 --> 17:24.300
And when they ask him how he was treated,

17:24.500 --> 17:26.400
They were quintessential gentlemen.

17:27.200 --> 17:29.399
Do you think I'm a quintessential
gentleman, Mercedes?

17:29.400 --> 17:31.400
Huh?

17:32.200 --> 17:35.199
What was so funny? What
were you laughing about?

17:35.200 --> 17:37.200
The funnies.

17:37.300 --> 17:38.500
The funnies? That
newspaper has no funnies.

17:40.300 --> 17:42.199
Why don't you try the one
about the kidnappers.

17:42.200 --> 17:43.200
Who only wanted publicity?

17:43.200 --> 17:44.200
Stop it!

17:44.400 --> 17:46.300
That's funny. That's funny.

17:46.400 --> 17:47.400
Leave him alone! Stop!

17:48.300 --> 17:51.299
Yeah. Come on.

17:51.300 --> 17:52.400
Stop! Let him go!

17:56.300 --> 17:57.400
Please stop!

17:58.400 --> 18:01.299
Stop it! Stop it!

18:01.300 --> 18:02.300
Stop it!

18:13.300 --> 18:15.299
Huh?

18:15.300 --> 18:16.499
You want to be tough? Huh?

18:16.500 --> 18:19.299
Wanna play in my city?

18:19.300 --> 18:20.400
Spoiled rich bastard!

18:22.300 --> 18:25.300
You do not want to disappoint me.

18:25.400 --> 18:28.299
Believe me.

18:28.300 --> 18:30.299
I'm gonna go for a walk.

18:30.300 --> 18:33.299
When I get back,

18:33.300 --> 18:35.400
I want you to tell me who Peligro is.

18:43.300 --> 18:44.400
I'm back.

18:46.400 --> 18:49.400
Who's Peligro? Huh?

18:56.200 --> 18:58.300
You're not a good listener.

19:00.200 --> 19:03.200
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

19:16.400 --> 19:20.399
Ooh. No, I'm okay, I'm okay.

19:20.400 --> 19:24.299
I'm gonna go for a walk, okay?

19:24.300 --> 19:26.200
So you better be thinking
about who Peligro is,

19:26.400 --> 19:29.200
'cause you're next.

19:29.300 --> 19:32.200
Let's go for some coffee.

19:32.300 --> 19:35.200
You're here about your brother.

19:35.300 --> 19:37.199
Your little brother's a criminal

19:37.200 --> 19:39.399
a dangerous criminal.

19:39.400 --> 19:41.199
No doubt about that.

19:41.200 --> 19:43.199
I've got his file if you wanna read it.

19:43.200 --> 19:45.200
No, thank you.

19:46.400 --> 19:48.199
I know my brother,

19:48.200 --> 19:51.400
and no file will ever change that.

19:51.500 --> 19:56.199
Fico, we've known each other
since we were in prep school.

19:56.200 --> 19:57.299
I've always been straight with you.

19:57.300 --> 19:58.300
That's true.

19:58.400 --> 20:00.300
Have you ever known me
to change my signals?

20:00.400 --> 20:02.200
Not when you were my catcher.

20:02.300 --> 20:04.300
Fico, you're pitching
for your brother now.

20:04.400 --> 20:06.300
You're pitching wild.

20:06.400 --> 20:08.400
He's guilty. There's no doubt about that.

20:09.300 --> 20:11.400
I know it and you know it.

20:12.300 --> 20:14.200
He's my brother, Braulio.

20:18.400 --> 20:20.200
I need your help.

20:25.200 --> 20:26.200
Okay.

20:27.300 --> 20:28.400
I think you should get out of Havana,

20:29.200 --> 20:30.200
go to New York or Miami,

20:30.201 --> 20:32.199
and I'm gonna take care of the tickets.

20:32.200 --> 20:34.200
Fico, Fidel's gonna take care of me.

20:36.300 --> 20:38.200
I'm leaving for the Sierra Maestra.

20:38.300 --> 20:39.400
Hey.

20:42.300 --> 20:44.200
Fico, I have no choice.

20:47.400 --> 20:49.200
What about your family?

20:49.300 --> 20:52.200
Everything I do is for my family.

20:57.300 --> 20:58.400
I love you.

21:12.200 --> 21:13.400
Uh, come in.

21:15.300 --> 21:16.300
Can I help you?

21:16.301 --> 21:18.299
Al sent me.

21:18.300 --> 21:19.500
Who?

21:21.500 --> 21:23.200
Al.

21:23.300 --> 21:24.499
He's a friend of yours, isn't he?

21:24.500 --> 21:26.300
Are you auditioning?

21:27.300 --> 21:29.299
Yes, I am.

21:29.300 --> 21:30.400
What's your line?

21:30.500 --> 21:31.400
I'm a comedian.

21:33.400 --> 21:36.299
I'm a stand-up comedian.

21:36.300 --> 21:39.200
Who prefers to remain seated.

21:39.300 --> 21:40.399
That's it? That's your line?

21:40.400 --> 21:42.200
Yeah.

21:43.400 --> 21:44.400
Some jokes for your emcee.

21:45.200 --> 21:46.200
He writes his own jokes.

21:46.300 --> 21:48.300
They're lousy. So are yours.

21:48.400 --> 21:50.299
Touch?

21:50.300 --> 21:52.399
You want some help writing
some of your other material?

21:52.400 --> 21:55.199
Nobody writes anybody's
material around here.

21:55.200 --> 21:56.299
You just improvise?

21:56.300 --> 21:58.199
You can call it that. Try New York.

21:58.200 --> 22:01.199
Too cold. Too rich.

22:01.200 --> 22:02.300
Too close to home.

22:02.400 --> 22:04.299
Well, I'm afraid you're going to have to

22:04.300 --> 22:05.300
find another line of work, then.

22:06.200 --> 22:07.299
I can't.

22:07.300 --> 22:10.199
The laughter you just
become addicted to it.

22:10.200 --> 22:12.199
What'd you say your name was?

22:12.200 --> 22:16.400
I didn't. I said Al sent me.

22:16.500 --> 22:20.400
If you know Al, you know me.

22:21.300 --> 22:23.300
Oh, Al's friend.

22:23.500 --> 22:24.400
Where've you been?

22:24.500 --> 22:26.299
Where haven't I been?

22:26.300 --> 22:28.300
Federico, remember your appointment.

22:28.500 --> 22:30.300
And don't forget your dancing shoes.

22:30.400 --> 22:31.400
You're going to need them.

22:32.300 --> 22:35.299
Oh, Rodney?

22:35.300 --> 22:36.400
Maestro?

22:37.300 --> 22:40.300
Oh, nevermind.

22:42.400 --> 22:46.299
I think I have a job for you after all.

22:46.300 --> 22:48.400
Finally, after all these years

22:48.500 --> 22:51.400
of sacrifice and dedication,

22:51.500 --> 22:54.300
a break.

23:00.300 --> 23:02.299
Why can't you tell me who we're meeting?

23:02.300 --> 23:03.300
It's better that way.

23:03.300 --> 23:04.300
I love surprises.

23:04.400 --> 23:05.400
Just don't say a word

23:06.200 --> 23:07.200
no matter what.

23:07.201 --> 23:09.399
Sit there, pretend you're my security.
That's it.

23:09.400 --> 23:11.400
Howâ€™s this? Cozy enough?

23:12.200 --> 23:13.399
Look a little bit more dangerous.

23:13.400 --> 23:15.300
How about this?

23:17.400 --> 23:18.200
More dangerous.

23:19.400 --> 23:21.400
This is my meanest.

23:24.400 --> 23:26.200
Save that.

23:27.300 --> 23:28.200
Can I make a wish?

23:28.300 --> 23:29.300
Be my guest.

23:29.500 --> 23:34.399
I wish for a tall, athletic,
caramel-colored beauty.

23:34.400 --> 23:35.400
Okay.

23:39.300 --> 23:41.400
An open-door policy is the
sign of a great host.

23:42.300 --> 23:44.200
Mr. Lansky, come in. Welcome.

23:44.400 --> 23:47.299
Should I call you Federico,

23:47.300 --> 23:50.200
Mr. Fellove, or Fico?

23:52.400 --> 23:56.200
Depends on whether you
shake my hand or not.

23:56.300 --> 23:57.399
Call me Fico.

23:57.400 --> 23:59.400
You can call my Meyer. All my friends do.

24:00.300 --> 24:02.300
Have a seat.

24:03.400 --> 24:04.400
Who is this guy?

24:04.401 --> 24:07.399
Don't mind him, he's just a comedian.

24:07.400 --> 24:08.400
A blind one?

24:08.400 --> 24:09.400
Mute.

24:09.401 --> 24:11.199
That's funny.

24:11.200 --> 24:12.300
Would you like a drink?

24:12.400 --> 24:16.399
A little seltzer, unless
you happen to, uh...

24:16.400 --> 24:17.400
have an egg cream.

24:18.200 --> 24:19.200
I have eggs and I have cream.

24:19.400 --> 24:20.400
And you have a blind comedian.

24:20.500 --> 24:22.300
Mute.

24:24.500 --> 24:26.300
An egg cream is neither egg nor cream.

24:26.400 --> 24:28.300
Would you like to know how to make one?

24:28.500 --> 24:29.500
Well, that would've
been my next question.

24:30.200 --> 24:31.400
Well, let's see how this goes first.

24:32.200 --> 24:35.200
A little seltzer for now.
Cuts the humidity.

24:38.400 --> 24:40.500
You hear that, comedian?

24:41.200 --> 24:42.400
You said something on the phone
about a business opportunity.

24:43.200 --> 24:46.200
Well played. Le Chaim.

24:48.400 --> 24:51.199
I propose a partnership between us.

24:51.200 --> 24:54.199
20% goes to the house,

24:54.200 --> 24:56.299
the rest to me, my associates.

24:56.300 --> 24:57.300
It doesn't have to be anything big.

24:58.200 --> 24:59.399
I mean, this is very cozy here.

24:59.400 --> 25:01.199
You could have a couple of tables,

25:01.200 --> 25:04.399
craps, you know,
blackjack, a wheel or two.

25:04.400 --> 25:06.200
This is nice.

25:06.300 --> 25:08.200
Mr. Lansky.

25:10.200 --> 25:12.400
Call him Meyer.

25:13.300 --> 25:14.400
Or Mr. Lansky.

25:15.200 --> 25:16.400
You want him here?

25:17.300 --> 25:19.399
Meyer, I appreciate the offer,

25:19.400 --> 25:21.300
but, regretfully, I have to pass.

25:21.400 --> 25:24.299
Now, I know this is a
tremendous opportunity for me.

25:24.300 --> 25:27.399
However, El Tropico is a place of music,

25:27.400 --> 25:29.400
and that's how I would like it to stay.

25:33.200 --> 25:34.399
Let me rephrase.

25:34.400 --> 25:36.200
We have the beginning

25:36.300 --> 25:38.200
of a mutually beneficial relationship.

25:38.300 --> 25:40.399
It would be a pity to see it
end before it even began.

25:40.400 --> 25:41.400
Yes, it would.

25:41.401 --> 25:43.400
All right.

25:47.400 --> 25:51.300
I was informed you were a reasonable man.

25:51.400 --> 25:53.299
I hope I wasn't misinformed.

25:53.300 --> 25:54.200
You weren't.

25:54.400 --> 25:56.399
What I can offer you in return

25:56.400 --> 25:58.399
is what I offer all my friends

25:58.400 --> 26:00.400
an open-door policy.

26:01.300 --> 26:03.300
Consider my club your home any time.

26:03.500 --> 26:05.399
What, free seltzer?

26:05.400 --> 26:08.199
As much as you want.

26:08.200 --> 26:10.200
You know, in my business, Mr. Fellove,

26:10.400 --> 26:12.400
We have friends and we have enemies,

26:13.300 --> 26:15.300
but we don't have acquaintances.

26:17.200 --> 26:20.300
I hope to hear some good news very soon.

26:30.200 --> 26:34.299
Is that Meyer Lansky... Meyer Lansky?

26:34.300 --> 26:36.299
The head of the mob.

26:36.300 --> 26:38.200
I resign.

27:00.200 --> 27:03.199
Are you wearing false eyelashes,
or are you truly bashful?

27:03.200 --> 27:04.399
I never wear false eyelashes.

27:04.400 --> 27:05.300
That's my girl.

27:06.500 --> 27:07.400
Am I?

27:30.300 --> 27:31.399
Whose idea was that?

27:31.400 --> 27:33.400
Rodney's.

27:36.300 --> 27:37.399
Are you gonna be watching?

27:37.400 --> 27:40.300
Always.

28:12.300 --> 28:14.300
What's the matter?

28:19.300 --> 28:20.300
What's wrong?

28:20.301 --> 28:22.400
Luis has another woman.

28:22.500 --> 28:24.200
Another woman?

28:28.300 --> 28:32.199
He hasn't come home in two days,

28:32.200 --> 28:36.300
and before that, we haven't.

28:36.400 --> 28:38.500
His mind is elsewhere.

28:40.400 --> 28:42.200
Has he called?

28:42.400 --> 28:44.299
Just to say that he's okay,

28:44.300 --> 28:46.500
and that's all he says.

28:48.300 --> 28:51.200
Fico, help me.

28:51.300 --> 28:54.300
You're the only one I can turn to.

28:54.400 --> 28:56.300
I'm gonna take care of it.

29:22.200 --> 29:24.400
She's worried about you.

29:28.200 --> 29:29.400
She came to you?

29:33.200 --> 29:34.400
She's always had a...

29:36.400 --> 29:39.299
very special place in her heart for you.

29:39.300 --> 29:41.399
And you for her.

29:41.400 --> 29:44.399
What's the matter? Talk to me.

29:44.400 --> 29:47.299
I'm not gonna get you involved.

29:47.300 --> 29:50.399
I'm your brother. I'm involved.
What's up?

29:50.400 --> 29:52.299
Is it another woman?

29:52.300 --> 29:53.200
Yes.

29:55.400 --> 29:58.200
Liberty.

30:21.300 --> 30:23.299
You involved with Fidel? No.

30:23.300 --> 30:25.299
26th of July Movement, like Ricardo?

30:25.300 --> 30:26.200
No.

30:28.200 --> 30:31.399
Directorio Revolucionario.

30:31.400 --> 30:33.300
We're no longer associated.

30:33.400 --> 30:36.400
We have our own ideas for Cuba.

30:37.200 --> 30:39.300
Pluralism,

30:39.400 --> 30:41.300
the restoration of the 1940 Constitution.

30:42.200 --> 30:43.200
You know, democracy.

30:43.201 --> 30:44.399
That's what Fidel says he wants.

30:44.400 --> 30:47.300
Sure, that's what he says,
but he can't be trusted.

30:47.400 --> 30:50.300
You think he's a Communist?

30:50.400 --> 30:51.500
A Fidelista.

30:58.300 --> 31:00.400
You have to promise me something.

31:00.500 --> 31:01.400
What?

31:04.400 --> 31:06.300
Anything happens to me...

31:09.400 --> 31:10.500
you'll look after Aurora.

31:13.300 --> 31:15.200
She'll need you.

31:15.300 --> 31:16.400
Here, promise me.

31:19.200 --> 31:21.200
Promise me, Fico.

31:22.400 --> 31:25.299
I need this from you.

31:25.300 --> 31:27.400
I promise you.

31:28.200 --> 31:29.200
But you're gonna promise me

31:29.201 --> 31:32.300
that nothing's gonna
happen to you, right?

31:32.400 --> 31:34.399
Right?

31:34.400 --> 31:38.200
There's no happiness
outside the revolution.

31:47.500 --> 31:49.500
Okay.

31:54.300 --> 31:57.199
Don't do something stupid.

31:57.200 --> 31:59.200
Okay?

32:33.300 --> 32:36.499
Ricardo Fellove, 26th of July Movement.

32:36.500 --> 32:40.299
Fellove. Are you the dancer?

32:40.300 --> 32:43.400
Because we don't need any dancers.

32:46.400 --> 32:49.400
Okay, get off the horse. We're hungry.

33:08.200 --> 33:09.300
It's not another woman.

33:09.400 --> 33:12.300
Then why won't he come back?

33:12.400 --> 33:13.400
He doesn't want us involved.

33:14.300 --> 33:16.299
What is it? The revolution?

33:16.300 --> 33:17.400
He doesn't want us involved.

33:18.300 --> 33:19.300
That's it?

33:19.301 --> 33:20.400
That's it.

33:30.300 --> 33:34.200
Am I supposed to take
that home and be happy?

33:34.300 --> 33:36.200
I'm his wife.

33:36.400 --> 33:38.399
I have the right to be involved.

33:38.400 --> 33:42.199
If something happens to
him, it happens to me.

33:42.200 --> 33:43.399
To all of us.

33:43.400 --> 33:45.500
And then what?

34:33.400 --> 34:37.199
I think it was the Mafia, Meyer Lansky,

34:39.199 --> 34:40.300
but I can't be certain.

34:40.400 --> 34:44.299
Havana is no longer a capital city,

34:44.300 --> 34:48.199
but a capital sin.

34:49.500 --> 34:51.300
This is not new, of course,

34:51.500 --> 34:56.400
but even Jesus had to
whip the moneylenders

34:56.500 --> 34:58.299
out of the temple.

34:58.300 --> 35:03.199
We're badly in need of a

35:03.200 --> 35:05.300
of a Christ with a whip.

35:09.500 --> 35:12.300
I don't know what to do.

35:18.300 --> 35:22.199
Satyagraha.

35:22.200 --> 35:23.299
Do you know what that is?

35:23.300 --> 35:26.199
No.

35:26.200 --> 35:28.300
It is the Hindu word.

35:28.400 --> 35:32.299
For passive resistance.

35:32.300 --> 35:37.200
Gandhi resisted passively,

35:37.300 --> 35:38.200
and he won.

35:41.400 --> 35:44.400
My son, in the sea,

35:44.500 --> 35:46.500
even a shark can drown.

36:19.300 --> 36:21.299
Okay, we all know how to make it

36:21.300 --> 36:23.299
into the Presidential
Palace by heart now?

36:23.300 --> 36:25.200
So let's review one last time.

36:25.300 --> 36:27.500
I will take over the CNQ radio
station and read our statement.

36:28.300 --> 36:29.300
Carbo?

36:29.500 --> 36:32.200
Machado and I will attack with
Peligro through the main gates,

36:32.400 --> 36:34.399
along with Menoyo and his group.

36:34.400 --> 36:36.400
Ignacio, you will provide
sniper protection

36:37.200 --> 36:38.200
and reinforcements.

36:38.300 --> 36:40.400
Any questions?

36:43.200 --> 36:45.300
What do you think, Peligro?

36:53.400 --> 36:55.200
It's time.

37:56.200 --> 37:58.200
Mockingbird Pet Shop. Can I help you?

37:58.300 --> 38:00.400
The bird is in the cage.

38:04.500 --> 38:06.400
He's in.

38:10.200 --> 38:11.300
Long live a free Cuba.

38:11.400 --> 38:13.300
Long live a free Cuba.

38:19.300 --> 38:20.500
Mr. President?

38:24.300 --> 38:26.300
Mr. President?

38:27.400 --> 38:30.300
What is it, Pizzi?

38:30.400 --> 38:34.200
There are urgent matters
for you to attend to.

38:39.200 --> 38:42.200
I've been signing edicts all week,

38:42.300 --> 38:45.299
and you know what I've
been thinking, Pizzi?

38:45.300 --> 38:47.299
I'm a fortunate man

38:47.300 --> 38:51.200
for having had to sign one
single death warrant.

38:51.300 --> 38:54.299
Mr. President, if I might say so myself,

38:54.300 --> 38:58.300
you are a fortunate man,
but also a noble man.

38:58.400 --> 39:00.300
Thank you, Pizzi. That's
very kind of you.

39:01.200 --> 39:03.199
No, no, no, no, no. It is not kindness.

39:03.200 --> 39:05.300
It is historical justice.

39:16.400 --> 39:20.299
Have I ever told you how
much I appreciate you?

39:20.300 --> 39:23.399
No, sir.

39:23.400 --> 39:25.400
Oh.

39:35.300 --> 39:36.300
Sorry I'm late.

39:36.301 --> 39:37.400
I got stuck in Pinelarillo.

39:39.300 --> 39:40.200
What do you want?

39:40.300 --> 39:41.400
I got 450 napkins and tablecloths.

39:41.500 --> 39:44.299
I'm gonna need help
getting it out of here.

39:44.300 --> 39:46.299
I don't have any deliveries
on my list today.

39:46.300 --> 39:47.300
This is the front gate, right?

39:47.301 --> 39:49.200
Yeah, it's the front gate.

39:49.300 --> 39:51.300
They told me 3:00 at the front gate.

39:51.400 --> 39:53.300
Can you check? Can you.

39:53.400 --> 39:55.200
All right. Stay there.

39:57.300 --> 39:58.300
Is any deliveries on the list today?

39:59.200 --> 40:00.200
No.

40:16.400 --> 40:19.200
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

40:19.300 --> 40:20.200
Go ahead, go in!

40:20.300 --> 40:21.300
Here!

40:25.400 --> 40:27.400
What's that noise?

40:42.500 --> 40:43.400
Come with me! Now!

41:50.200 --> 41:51.200
Let's go!

42:11.200 --> 42:13.300
Fico! The palace is being attacked.

42:13.400 --> 42:16.400
Listen. Manzanita's taken
over the radio station.

42:20.300 --> 42:23.399
People of Cuba, the
dictator Fulgencio Batista

42:23.400 --> 42:26.200
has just met revolutionary justice.

42:27.200 --> 42:28.200
The gunfire that extinguished

42:28.201 --> 42:29.400
the bloody life of the dictator

42:30.200 --> 42:32.200
can still be heard around
the Presidential Palace.

42:33.200 --> 42:35.199
It is we, The Directorio Revolucionario,

42:35.200 --> 42:37.300
the iron hand of the Cuban Revolution.

42:37.400 --> 42:38.400
Who have accomplished the final blow

42:38.500 --> 42:39.400
against this shameful regime

42:39.500 --> 42:41.300
still twisting in its own agony.

42:41.400 --> 42:44.200
Cubans who can hear me, he
has just been eliminated.

42:44.400 --> 42:46.300
Long live a free Cuba!

42:46.400 --> 42:48.300
Que vive una Cuba libre!

43:11.200 --> 43:12.400
Carbo! Carbo!

43:15.400 --> 43:17.300
Luis! Luis!

43:17.400 --> 43:18.300
Luis!

43:20.200 --> 43:21.200
Luis!

43:25.200 --> 43:26.400
Luis!

43:34.300 --> 43:37.500
Pizzi, leave us alone.

43:41.500 --> 43:45.199
With friends or without friends?

43:45.200 --> 43:47.300
As you like.

43:56.200 --> 43:58.200
Pizzi.

43:58.400 --> 43:59.300
Yes, sir?

44:07.400 --> 44:10.299
People of Cuba,

44:10.300 --> 44:14.400
today alien forces made
an attempt on my life.

44:18.300 --> 44:20.199
As you can see,

44:20.200 --> 44:24.399
the news of my demise
is vastly exaggerated.

44:24.400 --> 44:29.300
The President now declares
business as usual in Havana.

44:31.300 --> 44:35.400
I lend a helping hand to
those law-abiding citizens

44:36.200 --> 44:38.400
and our loyal oppositions.

44:40.200 --> 44:45.200
The future of Cuba is safe.

44:45.300 --> 44:47.400
Abuelo!

44:50.300 --> 44:54.300
Our children are safe.

44:58.300 --> 45:00.300
That is all.

45:00.400 --> 45:02.400
Salud.

45:12.500 --> 45:14.299
Life is becoming a dress rehearsal

45:14.300 --> 45:15.500
for a show nobody'll see.

45:21.300 --> 45:22.300
What's the word on Luis?

45:22.301 --> 45:23.399
He's nowhere to be found.

45:23.400 --> 45:24.400
Are you sure he's alive?

45:25.200 --> 45:27.199
Positive.

45:27.200 --> 45:29.199
He might be abroad.

45:29.200 --> 45:30.300
He might be abroad.

45:32.300 --> 45:33.300
I'm leaving.

45:34.500 --> 45:36.300
I'm leaving.

45:44.500 --> 45:46.300
I'm sorry. There's no news.

45:47.300 --> 45:48.300
Was he part of the attack?

45:48.500 --> 45:49.300
Yes.

45:50.500 --> 45:52.399
Why won't you tell me where he is?

45:52.400 --> 45:54.200
Because I don't know where he is.

45:56.200 --> 45:57.499
Fico, if something happens,

45:57.500 --> 45:59.400
I want to be there...

45:59.500 --> 46:00.400
for him.

46:00.500 --> 46:01.400
So do I.

49:20.200 --> 49:22.299
May I offer a serious thought

49:22.300 --> 49:24.300
from someone who's never serious?

49:25.300 --> 49:26.400
No.

49:27.500 --> 49:28.400
Well, that was it.

49:56.200 --> 49:57.399
Mmm.

49:57.400 --> 49:58.400
It's good.

50:02.400 --> 50:05.200
A man with a purpose.

50:28.500 --> 50:30.400
A man with less of a purpose.

50:32.300 --> 50:35.299
Fellove, come on. Please join me.

50:35.300 --> 50:38.400
Mmm. Mmm!

50:45.300 --> 50:47.299
In our house,

50:47.300 --> 50:49.300
Sunday dinner is not a moveable feast.

50:54.300 --> 50:56.300
It is at 6, as usual.

50:57.500 --> 50:59.300
Sorry.

51:01.200 --> 51:03.399
All my sons are welcome, but..

51:03.400 --> 51:05.200
Not a minute after6.

51:08.400 --> 51:12.300
You must always chew. It's
good for your health.

51:12.400 --> 51:14.200
You chew and you chew.

51:15.200 --> 51:16.300
Mmm.

51:16.400 --> 51:18.300
And then you chew some more.

51:22.300 --> 51:26.299
See, I'm a man of... good digestion.

51:26.300 --> 51:31.399
In fact, if I wasn't such a modest man,

51:31.400 --> 51:33.400
I'd say I'm a man of great digestion.

51:35.500 --> 51:38.300
That's why I'm still alive.

51:38.400 --> 51:40.200
About our little business...

51:44.300 --> 51:45.300
our business?

51:45.500 --> 51:47.399
Yeah, our business.

51:47.400 --> 51:49.300
My business is El Tropico.

51:49.400 --> 51:52.300
And I would love to continue
going to El Tropico.

51:56.400 --> 52:01.200
So unless that's a prop for
one of your new shows...

52:02.500 --> 52:07.299
I'm asking myself,

52:07.300 --> 52:09.299
what is a song and dance man

52:09.300 --> 52:10.300
because that's what you do, huh?

52:10.500 --> 52:11.400
Just a little song and dance,

52:11.500 --> 52:13.399
and you put on a little show

52:13.400 --> 52:15.400
doing with a .32 caliber Smith & Wesson?

52:16.200 --> 52:17.400
What? Hey!

52:18.400 --> 52:19.300
What?

52:19.500 --> 52:23.300
What, are you planning to
shoot your piano player?

52:23.500 --> 52:26.499
Do you have a new cowboy routine

52:26.500 --> 52:28.300
in El Tropico now, or something?

52:34.500 --> 52:36.400
Any word from Ricardo?

52:38.400 --> 52:39.400
No.

52:43.300 --> 52:45.300
Why were you late for dinner tonight?

52:48.400 --> 52:49.300
Hmm?

52:52.300 --> 52:53.400
I have enemies.

52:55.300 --> 52:56.200
Cono.

52:57.400 --> 52:59.299
And I have the right to protect myself.

52:59.300 --> 53:02.299
Cono.

53:02.300 --> 53:05.300
Fellove, am I your enemy?

53:05.400 --> 53:08.300
You weren't my enemy until
you killed my brother.

53:08.400 --> 53:13.400
Luis Fellove, alias Peligro.

53:14.200 --> 53:17.199
Not angel,

53:17.200 --> 53:19.400
not the Virgin Mary.

53:20.200 --> 53:21.399
Peligro!

53:21.400 --> 53:24.200
I swear, I did not kill your brother.

53:24.300 --> 53:27.300
Your brother attacked the
Presidential Palace.

53:27.500 --> 53:29.400
With the intent to kill my President.

53:31.400 --> 53:33.300
He committed suicide.

53:36.400 --> 53:41.299
Believe me, you do not
want to disappoint me.

53:41.300 --> 53:42.200
Trust me on this.

53:45.500 --> 53:49.200
I can see all you have
is thirst for revenge.

53:56.300 --> 53:58.300
Ah, I see.

53:58.400 --> 54:04.400
You know what a zugzwang is?

54:04.500 --> 54:06.299
It's a chess move.

54:06.300 --> 54:07.399
Mm-hmm.

54:07.400 --> 54:12.300
It is a chess move that
is no move at all.

54:14.400 --> 54:17.400
It is actually a position

54:18.300 --> 54:21.200
the position in which each player.

54:21.300 --> 54:25.300
Will obtain a worse result

54:25.400 --> 54:29.300
if it were his time to move

54:29.400 --> 54:32.299
than if it were not.

54:32.300 --> 54:35.300
Do you follow?

54:35.400 --> 54:37.400
A double-bind.

54:39.200 --> 54:40.500
A reciprocal situation.

54:43.300 --> 54:47.399
All you have to do is act accordingly.

54:47.400 --> 54:49.300
Which means...

54:56.500 --> 54:58.400
Do not act at all.

54:59.200 --> 55:00.400
Go.

55:14.200 --> 55:16.199
Ho ho ho!

55:16.200 --> 55:17.399
Hey, hey!

55:17.400 --> 55:20.300
Bravissimo, Fellove! Bravissimo!

55:20.400 --> 55:23.200
A showman to the end!

55:29.300 --> 55:32.400
One more audition.

55:37.300 --> 55:39.500
So just about any clothes fit you, huh?

55:47.400 --> 55:49.499
She's very lonely.

55:49.500 --> 55:52.300
Ever since she moved in,
she won't go out at all.

55:53.200 --> 55:54.500
Not even with her friends.

55:56.500 --> 55:59.299
The memory of your brother,

55:59.300 --> 56:01.300
and the fact that she has not been able

56:01.500 --> 56:05.299
to have a family of her own...

56:05.300 --> 56:07.299
I hate to see her so sad.

56:07.300 --> 56:09.200
It breaks my heart.

56:10.500 --> 56:12.400
Why don't you ask her out?

56:13.300 --> 56:14.399
She would like that.

56:14.400 --> 56:16.200
It would do her good.

56:19.200 --> 56:23.200
She needs you, and you need her.

56:57.200 --> 56:59.199
Fico, talk to me.

56:59.200 --> 57:01.300
Please.

57:07.300 --> 57:10.300
You know the last thing Luis
said to me before he died?

57:14.300 --> 57:15.400
What?

57:16.300 --> 57:17.400
He made me promise...

57:20.300 --> 57:21.400
that if anything ever happened to him,

57:21.500 --> 57:23.300
I would take care of you.

57:38.500 --> 57:40.400
You've grown up in Havana all your life,

57:41.200 --> 57:44.400
and I bet there's parts of the
city you don't know at all.

57:47.300 --> 57:48.399
I'm sure you know them well.

57:48.400 --> 57:49.500
You know...

57:51.500 --> 57:53.200
Havana's very much like a rose.

57:53.300 --> 57:57.200
It has petals, and it has thorns.

57:57.300 --> 57:58.399
So it depends on how you grab it.

57:58.400 --> 58:02.200
But in the end, it always grabs you.

58:07.300 --> 58:09.400
Why don't you come out with me tomorrow?

58:09.500 --> 58:11.300
It'll do you good.

58:20.300 --> 58:22.499
You ever see Beny Mor? Live?

58:22.500 --> 58:24.300
Mmm.

58:24.500 --> 58:26.300
Ah!

58:31.300 --> 58:33.200
Have you been to the
Tropical Beer Gardens?

58:33.400 --> 58:35.400
Ah!

58:40.500 --> 58:42.500
It's good to see you smile.

59:22.300 --> 59:23.399
Thank you.

59:23.400 --> 59:25.199
Why are their handkerchiefs?

59:25.200 --> 59:29.399
The handkerchiefs are
so there's no evidence.

59:29.400 --> 59:31.300
Of what?

59:33.400 --> 59:35.300
Of the intimacy they're sharing.

59:51.200 --> 59:52.499
Beny! Beny!

59:52.500 --> 59:55.399
Beny! Beny! Beny!

59:55.400 --> 59:58.299
Beny! Beny! Beny!

59:58.300 --> 59:59.500
Beny! Beny!

01:00:00.300 --> 01:00:02.299
Where is he?

01:00:02.300 --> 01:00:03.500
He's always late.

01:00:04.300 --> 01:00:06.400
Beny! Beny! Beny!

01:00:06.500 --> 01:00:09.300
Beny! Beny! Beny!

01:00:09.400 --> 01:00:11.200
Beny! Beny!

01:00:11.400 --> 01:00:13.200
He likes to make an entrance.

01:00:14.200 --> 01:00:15.400
There he is.

01:02:10.300 --> 01:02:13.299
How many more are in the barracks?

01:02:13.300 --> 01:02:14.399
Come on. Come on.

01:02:14.400 --> 01:02:16.300
How many more are in the barracks?

01:02:18.500 --> 01:02:20.400
Fellove!

01:02:20.500 --> 01:02:24.400
Let's move. Don't waste
any time with that.

01:02:24.500 --> 01:02:25.500
Let's move.

01:02:29.500 --> 01:02:31.300
You seem troubled, Fellove.

01:02:33.400 --> 01:02:35.300
Is it about the captain we shot?

01:02:36.200 --> 01:02:38.499
Listen to me very carefully.

01:02:38.500 --> 01:02:40.299
In an insurrection,

01:02:40.300 --> 01:02:42.300
the end justifies the means.

01:02:44.200 --> 01:02:45.399
What is an insurrection?

01:02:45.400 --> 01:02:47.300
Huh?

01:02:47.400 --> 01:02:48.300
Armed struggle.

01:02:50.200 --> 01:02:51.299
What is the end?

01:02:51.300 --> 01:02:52.399
Revolution.

01:02:52.400 --> 01:02:56.400
Which entails social, economic,
and political transformations.

01:02:58.200 --> 01:02:59.200
Like I said??

01:03:00.400 --> 01:03:03.399
The end justifies the means.

01:03:03.400 --> 01:03:05.200
Hmm?

01:04:51.400 --> 01:04:52.400
This is Havana.

01:04:55.400 --> 01:04:57.400
Who said a woman is like a flower?

01:04:58.300 --> 01:05:00.200
A poet with a sense of smell.

01:05:07.400 --> 01:05:09.399
May I join you?

01:05:09.400 --> 01:05:11.300
Yes.

01:05:19.200 --> 01:05:21.299
What was your name again?

01:05:21.300 --> 01:05:24.299
My name again is no name.

01:05:24.300 --> 01:05:25.399
What do you mean?

01:05:25.400 --> 01:05:27.400
I don't mean nothing!

01:05:29.400 --> 01:05:32.399
Names don't mean, people do.

01:05:32.400 --> 01:05:35.400
But you are people, aren't you?

01:05:36.200 --> 01:05:41.200
That... nobody can deny.

01:05:41.300 --> 01:05:43.200
So what's your name, then?

01:05:44.400 --> 01:05:46.299
I have no name.

01:05:46.300 --> 01:05:48.399
I already told you that.

01:05:48.400 --> 01:05:50.199
Everybody has a name.

01:05:50.200 --> 01:05:53.399
Mm-hmm. Everybody but me.

01:05:53.400 --> 01:05:54.400
Why not?

01:06:00.400 --> 01:06:02.199
I don't know.

01:06:02.200 --> 01:06:04.199
Ask him.

01:06:04.200 --> 01:06:05.200
Leave me out of your puns.

01:06:07.400 --> 01:06:10.200
You're the strangest man I ever met.

01:06:18.500 --> 01:06:19.500
Thank you.

01:06:22.300 --> 01:06:23.300
Thank you.

01:06:24.500 --> 01:06:26.300
Okay, Emilio.

01:06:27.400 --> 01:06:28.500
Your moneyâ€™s no good here.

01:06:29.300 --> 01:06:31.299
Thank you, Emilio.

01:06:31.300 --> 01:06:32.300
I'll see you at the club.

01:06:34.300 --> 01:06:35.300
When I grow up,

01:06:35.400 --> 01:06:37.200
I wanna be just like him.

01:06:38.300 --> 01:06:40.300
Why?

01:06:41.200 --> 01:06:42.400
Because...

01:06:42.500 --> 01:06:44.300
he never pays.

01:06:51.500 --> 01:06:55.400
We interrupt this program
with a special news report.

01:06:58.500 --> 01:07:02.200
The University of Havana was
closed by the government today,

01:07:02.300 --> 01:07:05.299
as a direct result of the ongoing riots.

01:07:05.300 --> 01:07:06.399
President Fulgencio Batista,

01:07:06.400 --> 01:07:08.399
Who is under intense pressure to resign,

01:07:08.400 --> 01:07:10.399
declared publicly today
that the government.

01:07:10.400 --> 01:07:13.499
Will not tolerate the disgracing
of the sacred grounds

01:07:13.500 --> 01:07:15.400
of the university's Plaza Cadena,

01:07:15.500 --> 01:07:18.499
which he claims the professional
agitators were using

01:07:18.500 --> 01:07:21.300
for their selfish acts of anarchy.

01:08:02.500 --> 01:08:03.500
She wants to talk to you.

01:08:04.500 --> 01:08:05.500
It's okay.

01:08:07.500 --> 01:08:10.400
El tiempo no estacon ustedes.

01:08:14.200 --> 01:08:15.300
What did she say?

01:08:15.500 --> 01:08:17.399
Time is not on our side.

01:08:44.300 --> 01:08:45.300
Fico! Fico!

01:08:45.301 --> 01:08:46.399
Braulio. Hey!

01:08:46.500 --> 01:08:48.399
Happy New Year. Happy New Year.

01:08:48.500 --> 01:08:50.399
How are you? Same to you, my friend.

01:08:50.500 --> 01:08:51.399
This is Aurora.

01:08:51.500 --> 01:08:53.299
This is Captain Castel

01:08:53.300 --> 01:08:55.399
and his lovely wife Marie Cristina.
How are you?

01:08:55.500 --> 01:08:57.399
The pleasure's mine.

01:08:57.500 --> 01:08:58.399
Ah.

01:08:59.300 --> 01:09:00.399
You know, this is our year, Fico.

01:09:00.500 --> 01:09:01.500
I just got promoted.

01:09:02.300 --> 01:09:03.399
Congratulations. Thanks again.

01:09:04.300 --> 01:09:06.299
Well... it wasn't because
he's your brother.

01:09:06.300 --> 01:09:08.299
It's because you're still
my favorite pitcher.

01:09:08.300 --> 01:09:09.300
Well, you won't regret it.

01:09:09.500 --> 01:09:11.299
Well, I hope not.

01:09:11.300 --> 01:09:12.300
If you're wrong,

01:09:12.500 --> 01:09:14.300
not even your curveball's gonna save you.

01:09:15.500 --> 01:09:16.399
Let's dance. Okay.

01:09:16.500 --> 01:09:17.399
Bye-bye. Happy New Year.

01:09:18.300 --> 01:09:19.500
Happy New Year. Happy New Year.

01:09:49.500 --> 01:09:52.300
Senoras y senores, ladies and gentlemen,

01:09:52.399 --> 01:09:54.299
it's almost New Year's

01:09:54.300 --> 01:09:57.399
here at El Tropico and
all over the world!

01:09:57.400 --> 01:10:00.400
We have ignition. Engines running.

01:10:01.200 --> 01:10:02.400
Countdown!

01:10:03.200 --> 01:10:05.399
5, 4...

01:10:05.400 --> 01:10:07.299
3, 2...

01:10:07.300 --> 01:10:09.300
Happy 1959!

01:10:09.500 --> 01:10:11.400
Happy New Year to you all!

01:10:16.400 --> 01:10:18.400
Mm.

01:10:19.300 --> 01:10:20.200
Happy New Year.

01:10:20.300 --> 01:10:22.399
A new year, a new life,

01:10:22.400 --> 01:10:23.400
or so they say.

01:10:23.401 --> 01:10:25.400
I certainly hope so.

01:10:45.300 --> 01:10:46.300
Ladies and gentlemen,

01:10:46.301 --> 01:10:48.399
I give you the President of Cuba.

01:10:48.400 --> 01:10:50.400
Comrades in arms, friends.

01:10:52.400 --> 01:10:54.200
Happy New Year's!

01:10:56.500 --> 01:10:57.400
Salud!

01:11:05.200 --> 01:11:06.200
Why are you so unhappy?

01:11:08.400 --> 01:11:11.200
I'm not unhappy. I'm just sad.

01:11:11.400 --> 01:11:12.200
Don't be.

01:11:12.400 --> 01:11:14.399
It's in my nature.

01:11:14.400 --> 01:11:15.400
Hey.

01:11:17.300 --> 01:11:18.400
Beauty's your nature.

01:11:20.400 --> 01:11:21.400
Sad can be beautiful.

01:11:22.200 --> 01:11:23.200
Sad, yes, but not sadness.

01:11:34.200 --> 01:11:35.200
Whoa, whoa. Please.

01:11:35.200 --> 01:11:36.200
Ladies and gentlemen,

01:11:36.201 --> 01:11:37.400
we have an urgent announcement.

01:11:38.200 --> 01:11:39.399
Batista, President Batista,

01:11:39.400 --> 01:11:40.400
has left the country.

01:11:40.400 --> 01:11:41.400
He's gone forever.

01:11:44.300 --> 01:11:47.300
Let's celebrate a new Cuba!

01:11:47.400 --> 01:11:48.400
Music, maestro!

01:11:50.500 --> 01:11:52.400
Hold it! Hey! Hey, hey, come on!

01:11:55.500 --> 01:11:56.400
Come on, come on, come on!

01:12:20.400 --> 01:12:22.400
Vive Fidel Castro!

01:12:23.200 --> 01:12:25.300
Fidel! Fidel!

01:12:25.400 --> 01:12:28.300
Fidel! Fidel!

01:12:28.400 --> 01:12:31.199
Fidel! Fidel!

01:12:31.200 --> 01:12:33.500
Fidel! Fidel!

01:12:34.300 --> 01:12:36.400
Fidel! Fidel!

01:12:36.500 --> 01:12:39.200
Fidel! Fidel!

01:12:58.300 --> 01:13:01.399
Let us be thankful to God
for all he has given us.

01:13:01.400 --> 01:13:03.200
For the love we share,

01:13:03.300 --> 01:13:06.200
which should never be taken for granted.

01:13:06.300 --> 01:13:09.299
May it flourish and be fulfilled,

01:13:09.300 --> 01:13:11.299
as it is His gift to us.

01:13:11.300 --> 01:13:12.399
Amen.

01:13:12.400 --> 01:13:13.400
Amen.

01:13:54.300 --> 01:13:56.199
You seem truly happy.

01:13:56.200 --> 01:13:57.300
I am.

01:13:57.400 --> 01:13:58.400
And you?

01:14:00.300 --> 01:14:02.300
Me?

01:14:03.500 --> 01:14:05.200
I love you.

01:14:05.300 --> 01:14:06.300
And I you.

01:14:11.300 --> 01:14:12.399
I had a dream.

01:14:12.400 --> 01:14:13.400
What was it about?

01:14:14.200 --> 01:14:15.399
Us.

01:14:15.400 --> 01:14:16.400
Luis was there.

01:14:16.500 --> 01:14:18.300
What did he say?

01:14:18.400 --> 01:14:20.300
He said he was okay.

01:14:24.300 --> 01:14:25.400
What do you think?

01:14:28.400 --> 01:14:30.200
You really love me.

01:14:33.400 --> 01:14:34.400
Like I said.

01:14:35.400 --> 01:14:37.399
Say it to me.

01:14:37.400 --> 01:14:39.200
Say it again.

01:14:39.300 --> 01:14:41.200
Like I said?

01:14:53.400 --> 01:14:54.500
I love you.

01:15:34.300 --> 01:15:37.400
Watch them closely.

01:15:39.400 --> 01:15:41.200
I would be the only person in Havana

01:15:41.400 --> 01:15:43.200
man enough to turn my back on him.

01:15:43.300 --> 01:15:45.200
Hey, come on.

01:15:45.300 --> 01:15:49.200
A peeping Tom in reverse.

01:15:49.300 --> 01:15:51.399
When all the others are
watching the bearded Godiva,

01:15:51.400 --> 01:15:53.400
I will avert my eyes.

01:15:54.200 --> 01:15:56.200
Look how happy everybody is.

01:15:59.300 --> 01:16:02.200
Everyone is alike in jubilation.

01:16:02.400 --> 01:16:04.400
Only suffering makes them different.

01:16:28.300 --> 01:16:29.400
I'm need to see your cells.

01:16:30.300 --> 01:16:31.400
Cells? What cells?

01:16:33.300 --> 01:16:35.199
I have a friend in the cells.

01:16:35.200 --> 01:16:36.200
Attention!

01:16:38.200 --> 01:16:41.199
When a superior officer approaches you,

01:16:41.200 --> 01:16:43.199
you stand at attention.
Is that understood?

01:16:43.200 --> 01:16:44.399
Yes, comrade.

01:16:44.400 --> 01:16:46.300
At ease.

01:16:53.400 --> 01:16:55.300
I need to talk to you.

01:17:01.300 --> 01:17:02.499
What's the matter with you?

01:17:02.500 --> 01:17:04.299
You've been here all this time,

01:17:04.300 --> 01:17:05.499
and you haven't come see your family?

01:17:05.500 --> 01:17:06.400
What do you need?

01:17:06.500 --> 01:17:08.300
What do I need?

01:17:10.300 --> 01:17:11.300
What?

01:17:11.500 --> 01:17:13.400
I can't touch you?

01:17:14.300 --> 01:17:16.400
Castel is in here. He's in a cell.
I need to see him.

01:17:17.300 --> 01:17:18.400
There are no cells, Fico.

01:17:18.500 --> 01:17:20.300
There's only the cage.

01:17:22.500 --> 01:17:24.300
Take me to him.

01:17:25.500 --> 01:17:26.500
Take me to him.

01:17:26.501 --> 01:17:28.299
Don't fuck around.

01:17:28.300 --> 01:17:29.499
Take me to see him right now.

01:17:29.500 --> 01:17:30.500
As you wish.

01:17:33.500 --> 01:17:35.299
Brauilo!

01:17:35.300 --> 01:17:36.300
Brauilo!

01:17:36.300 --> 01:17:37.300
Hmm?

01:17:37.300 --> 01:17:38.300
Braulio.

01:17:40.300 --> 01:17:41.499
Come here. Come here.

01:17:41.500 --> 01:17:42.400
Fico.

01:17:42.500 --> 01:17:43.400
Fico, Fico.

01:17:47.500 --> 01:17:49.300
Oh, you don't look so tough now.

01:17:51.300 --> 01:17:53.299
It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.
I'm here.

01:17:53.300 --> 01:17:54.400
It's okay.

01:17:55.300 --> 01:17:56.300
It's okay. It's okay.

01:17:56.300 --> 01:17:57.300
Get me out of here.

01:17:57.301 --> 01:17:59.300
I'm gonna get you out of here.

01:18:00.500 --> 01:18:02.300
I'm not...

01:18:03.500 --> 01:18:05.299
I'm not an animal.

01:18:05.300 --> 01:18:10.499
I deserve... a proper jail.

01:18:10.500 --> 01:18:12.400
Well, you built it, we didn't.

01:18:12.500 --> 01:18:15.299
Listen to me. I

01:18:15.300 --> 01:18:18.499
I'm not innocent, okay?

01:18:18.500 --> 01:18:20.400
But I never killed anybody.

01:18:20.500 --> 01:18:22.400
You just like to pull people's eyes out

01:18:22.500 --> 01:18:24.399
and their teeth and
fingernails and piss on them.

01:18:24.400 --> 01:18:25.400
He saved your life!

01:18:25.500 --> 01:18:27.400
That was to sell you a favor!

01:18:27.500 --> 01:18:29.400
That's a lie. You know it.

01:18:32.300 --> 01:18:34.499
He's lying. He's lying.

01:18:34.500 --> 01:18:36.400
It's okay. Let me handle it.

01:18:37.300 --> 01:18:38.399
Look at me.

01:18:38.400 --> 01:18:40.299
Look at me. Look at me.

01:18:40.300 --> 01:18:42.200
I'm gonna take care of this.

01:18:42.300 --> 01:18:44.200
I believe in you.

01:18:46.200 --> 01:18:47.400
You came back.

01:19:05.500 --> 01:19:07.500
Let's go. He'll see you now.

01:19:19.400 --> 01:19:21.300
So you're the dancer.

01:19:23.200 --> 01:19:25.200
Che, I'm here to inquire about a.

01:19:25.300 --> 01:19:27.499
My name is Comandante Guevara.

01:19:27.500 --> 01:19:29.300
I'm Che only to my comrades.

01:19:29.400 --> 01:19:31.200
What can I do for you?

01:19:31.300 --> 01:19:33.400
My brother spoke to you
about a friend of mine,

01:19:33.500 --> 01:19:34.400
Captain Castel.

01:19:34.500 --> 01:19:36.300
Formerly a captain. What about him?

01:19:36.400 --> 01:19:38.299
He's detained here.

01:19:38.300 --> 01:19:39.500
No longer.

01:19:42.500 --> 01:19:44.300
He's been freed?

01:19:44.400 --> 01:19:46.399
In a way.

01:19:46.400 --> 01:19:48.299
What do you mean?

01:19:48.300 --> 01:19:50.399
You know what La Rouche
Foucauld said about life?

01:19:50.400 --> 01:19:54.200
There are two things
in life we cannot face

01:19:54.300 --> 01:19:55.400
the sun and death.

01:19:56.200 --> 01:19:58.400
Here we give people a
chance to face both.

01:20:00.200 --> 01:20:02.400
We shot your friend early this morning.

01:20:11.400 --> 01:20:13.300
Why do you bother with such scum?

01:20:15.300 --> 01:20:16.400
Why?

01:20:20.200 --> 01:20:23.399
Look, go to your cabaret

01:20:23.400 --> 01:20:25.400
and entertain the rich.

01:20:36.400 --> 01:20:37.400
Let's go, Fico.

01:20:45.300 --> 01:20:46.200
Go.

01:20:55.300 --> 01:20:57.299
Cha-cha-cha!

01:20:57.300 --> 01:20:58.300
Va.

01:20:59.300 --> 01:21:01.300
Va. Muy bien.

01:21:03.300 --> 01:21:04.400
Va.

01:21:05.200 --> 01:21:06.399
Hold it. Hold it.

01:21:06.400 --> 01:21:08.399
Hold it. Hold it.

01:21:08.400 --> 01:21:10.200
It's too military.

01:21:12.300 --> 01:21:14.400
All right, girls, lose the rifles.

01:21:15.400 --> 01:21:18.200
Very, very unmilitary now.

01:21:18.400 --> 01:21:19.200
M? Sica.

01:21:19.400 --> 01:21:20.400
1, 2, 3.

01:21:24.400 --> 01:21:26.300
Stop the music!

01:21:26.500 --> 01:21:28.300
Stop that music!

01:21:30.400 --> 01:21:31.400
Who are you?

01:21:31.401 --> 01:21:33.400
I am Zoraida Munoz,

01:21:33.500 --> 01:21:35.300
a delegate for the musicians' union.

01:21:35.400 --> 01:21:37.300
What authority do you have
to stop my rehearsal?

01:21:37.400 --> 01:21:40.399
The government gave me the authority.

01:21:40.400 --> 01:21:42.399
See, you own this beautiful cabaret,

01:21:42.400 --> 01:21:43.400
but we own the orchestra.

01:21:44.200 --> 01:21:45.300
Really?

01:21:45.400 --> 01:21:48.200
Really. If I tell the
orchestra not to play,

01:21:48.300 --> 01:21:49.399
they can't play.

01:21:49.400 --> 01:21:51.299
Is that so?

01:21:51.300 --> 01:21:53.399
Fico, we're in the union.

01:21:53.400 --> 01:21:54.400
They control the union.

01:21:56.200 --> 01:21:58.299
I see. And under what grounds do you have

01:21:58.300 --> 01:22:00.499
to come here and stop my show?

01:22:00.500 --> 01:22:02.299
You just can't use the saxophone

01:22:02.300 --> 01:22:03.400
in the orchestra anymore.

01:22:03.500 --> 01:22:05.200
Come again?

01:22:05.300 --> 01:22:07.499
The saxophone is a instrument
of the imperialists.

01:22:07.500 --> 01:22:10.400
The saxophone was invented

01:22:10.500 --> 01:22:13.299
by a man named Sax in Belgium!

01:22:13.300 --> 01:22:17.299
Do you know what the Belgian imperialists

01:22:17.300 --> 01:22:18.400
are doing in the Congo?

01:22:18.500 --> 01:22:20.299
They're a bunch of murderers.

01:22:20.300 --> 01:22:21.300
You don't say.

01:22:21.301 --> 01:22:22.400
No, I do say!

01:22:22.500 --> 01:22:24.299
And I am saying

01:22:24.300 --> 01:22:26.300
that if you want the orchestra to play,

01:22:26.500 --> 01:22:28.400
then you have to go
without the saxophone.

01:22:29.300 --> 01:22:31.300
Otherwise, I will stop the show.

01:22:56.300 --> 01:22:57.200
Great show.

01:22:57.400 --> 01:22:59.199
What's wrong with it?

01:22:59.200 --> 01:23:00.200
What's wrong with it?

01:23:00.201 --> 01:23:01.299
You mean besides the fact

01:23:01.300 --> 01:23:03.299
that they executed my friend in
two days without due process?

01:23:03.300 --> 01:23:05.400
And now they're threatening
to close down my club

01:23:05.500 --> 01:23:08.399
because we can't use
saxophones in the orchestra.

01:23:08.400 --> 01:23:10.500
Saxophones!

01:23:12.300 --> 01:23:14.200
Besides that?

01:23:16.200 --> 01:23:18.200
What about the pigeons?

01:23:18.300 --> 01:23:19.300
The pigeon.

01:23:19.301 --> 01:23:21.300
Never work with pigeons.

01:23:22.200 --> 01:23:23.299
Guano.

01:23:23.300 --> 01:23:25.299
Well, at least we don't have to deal

01:23:25.300 --> 01:23:27.399
with the likes of Meyer Lansky anymore.

01:23:27.400 --> 01:23:28.400
Maybe worse.

01:23:29.200 --> 01:23:31.400
Here's to a Cuba libre.

01:23:31.500 --> 01:23:34.300
Well, what do we do now?

01:23:35.300 --> 01:23:37.200
Let's go to Hernando's.

01:23:37.300 --> 01:23:39.400
Hernando's Hideaway.

01:23:40.200 --> 01:23:41.400
Now, that has a certain ring to it.

01:23:44.400 --> 01:23:45.400
I'm going.

01:23:45.401 --> 01:23:47.299
I'm going,

01:23:47.300 --> 01:23:51.200
which translates to I'm not going.

01:24:22.500 --> 01:24:24.400
Dance with me.

01:25:59.300 --> 01:26:00.400
What's wrong?

01:26:06.400 --> 01:26:07.400
What's happening?

01:26:08.200 --> 01:26:09.200
Viva El suerte de Fidel.

01:26:13.400 --> 01:26:15.200
Viva Fidel!

01:26:17.400 --> 01:26:19.399
It's Fidel.

01:26:19.400 --> 01:26:23.199
The guy we saw performing
with a pigeon once.

01:26:23.200 --> 01:26:25.300
Let's go over. I want to meet him.

01:26:26.200 --> 01:26:27.300
Too early in the day for that.

01:26:27.500 --> 01:26:29.299
There are some things I need to say.

01:26:29.300 --> 01:26:30.400
I want to speak with him.

01:26:31.300 --> 01:26:33.299
Will you please take me?

01:26:33.300 --> 01:26:34.300
What?

01:26:34.400 --> 01:26:36.399
There are some things I need to say.

01:26:36.400 --> 01:26:37.400
Would you please take me?

01:26:39.300 --> 01:26:40.400
No.

01:26:41.200 --> 01:26:42.400
I'll go on my own, then.

01:27:12.500 --> 01:27:15.199
Fidel's inviting us to
have breakfast with him.

01:27:15.200 --> 01:27:16.400
He invited you, not me.

01:27:16.500 --> 01:27:19.200
I don't think it's proper
for me to turn him down.

01:27:19.400 --> 01:27:22.200
Well, I don't think it's
proper for me to wait around.

01:27:25.300 --> 01:27:26.300
You're jealous.

01:27:26.301 --> 01:27:29.300
Of a circus ringmaster?

01:27:29.400 --> 01:27:30.400
You don't know me.

01:27:30.401 --> 01:27:32.400
I thought you never paid?

01:27:32.500 --> 01:27:35.400
I always pay sooner or later.

01:28:10.200 --> 01:28:10.500
Cecilia?

01:28:10.501 --> 01:28:12.400
Yes, dear.

01:28:13.200 --> 01:28:15.199
Was that Ricardo at the door?

01:28:15.200 --> 01:28:17.400
No, no. They had the wrong house.

01:28:18.200 --> 01:28:19.300
Oh.

01:28:33.400 --> 01:28:35.199
Aurora.

01:28:35.200 --> 01:28:36.300
Or should I say companera?

01:28:37.200 --> 01:28:40.199
Fidel sends his regard and admiration.

01:28:40.200 --> 01:28:42.199
He regrets that he couldn't be here

01:28:42.200 --> 01:28:43.300
to greet you personally.

01:28:43.400 --> 01:28:45.199
He sent me in his place

01:28:45.200 --> 01:28:47.300
to offer you something
of great importance.

01:28:48.200 --> 01:28:49.299
Good news and bad news.

01:28:49.300 --> 01:28:51.199
Somebody I know?

01:28:51.200 --> 01:28:52.500
Somebody you don't know.

01:28:53.200 --> 01:28:55.200
Aurora Bernal de Fellove,

01:28:55.300 --> 01:28:57.200
a widow of a martyr of the revolution

01:28:57.300 --> 01:28:58.300
Luis Fellove, who was killed

01:28:58.400 --> 01:29:01.299
in the massacre on Humboldt Street.

01:29:01.300 --> 01:29:03.300
After his heroic exploits

01:29:03.500 --> 01:29:06.300
during the assault on the
Presidential Palace.

01:29:06.500 --> 01:29:09.400
Comrade Aurora has been named.

01:29:09.500 --> 01:29:11.400
widow of the Revolution of the Year.

01:29:12.300 --> 01:29:14.299
Nice writers they have down here, huh?

01:29:14.300 --> 01:29:15.400
widow of the Revolution.

01:29:15.500 --> 01:29:17.299
Does that mean

01:29:17.300 --> 01:29:19.299
she was formerly married
to the revolution,

01:29:19.300 --> 01:29:22.399
and now the aforementioned
revolution is dead?

01:29:22.400 --> 01:29:25.199
And did that happen this year, too?

01:29:25.200 --> 01:29:26.400
And the copy

01:29:27.200 --> 01:29:29.399
even I can write better than that.

01:29:29.400 --> 01:29:31.400
But...

01:29:32.300 --> 01:29:34.399
it does suggest...

01:29:34.400 --> 01:29:36.399
heads up now.

01:29:36.400 --> 01:29:39.399
The Merry widow of the Revolution

01:29:39.400 --> 01:29:42.400
some songs, a little bit of business.

01:29:43.200 --> 01:29:44.399
Very nice musical you could open

01:29:44.400 --> 01:29:46.300
right here in Fico's Palace.

01:29:48.200 --> 01:29:49.500
I'd like to run with this one if I could.

01:29:50.300 --> 01:29:52.399
I'm gonna go see if I ca

01:29:52.400 --> 01:29:53.400
n nail down the rights.

01:29:58.500 --> 01:29:59.400
Hello.

01:29:59.500 --> 01:30:01.200
Hello, Fico.

01:30:01.300 --> 01:30:03.300
You haven't called me.

01:30:03.400 --> 01:30:05.400
I had work to do.

01:30:06.300 --> 01:30:07.200
You've just disappeared.

01:30:07.300 --> 01:30:09.200
I missed you.

01:30:09.300 --> 01:30:11.400
Work to do.

01:30:11.500 --> 01:30:13.400
Have you seen it in the papers?

01:30:13.500 --> 01:30:15.400
Isn't it wonderful?

01:30:17.400 --> 01:30:19.300
Yes, I'm glad to hear it.

01:30:19.400 --> 01:30:21.300
Luis should be so proud.

01:30:21.500 --> 01:30:22.500
Right.

01:30:23.300 --> 01:30:25.299
The reason I called you is to invite you

01:30:25.300 --> 01:30:27.400
to a little celebration in my honor.

01:30:28.300 --> 01:30:29.400
Would you please come?

01:30:30.200 --> 01:30:32.200
Maybe some other time.
Listen, I have to go.

01:30:32.300 --> 01:30:33.300
All right.

01:30:33.400 --> 01:30:35.399
Please call me.

01:30:35.400 --> 01:30:37.400
I love you.

01:30:48.300 --> 01:30:50.300
Once more into the breach.

01:30:54.400 --> 01:30:55.300
What can I do for you?

01:30:55.400 --> 01:30:57.299
We're closing down this cabaret

01:30:57.300 --> 01:30:59.299
on account of gambling.

01:30:59.300 --> 01:31:00.300
Gambling.

01:31:00.500 --> 01:31:02.300
Illegal gambling.

01:31:02.400 --> 01:31:03.200
What illegal gambling?

01:31:03.400 --> 01:31:06.500
We caught two stagehands playing cards.

01:31:07.300 --> 01:31:08.200
And that's illegal.

01:31:08.300 --> 01:31:10.199
Oh, it's worse than that.

01:31:10.200 --> 01:31:12.200
It is a dangerous
distraction to the masses.

01:31:12.300 --> 01:31:15.300
The opium of the people, Marx said.

01:31:15.500 --> 01:31:18.500
I thought Marx said religion
was the opiate of the people.

01:31:19.300 --> 01:31:20.300
Marx said that, too.

01:31:20.400 --> 01:31:22.200
Karl or Groucho?

01:31:23.300 --> 01:31:26.299
Also an illegal gambling game.

01:31:26.300 --> 01:31:27.300
The revolutionary government

01:31:27.301 --> 01:31:29.300
will decide when, how,

01:31:29.400 --> 01:31:34.300
and if this premises will
be functioning again.

01:31:36.400 --> 01:31:39.400
You son of a bitch! How dare you?

01:31:42.400 --> 01:31:44.200
I'm an artist!

01:31:44.300 --> 01:31:46.300
Puta! Cono!

01:31:46.400 --> 01:31:48.400
Likewise.

01:33:04.300 --> 01:33:07.400
Hello! My nephew the hero!

01:33:09.300 --> 01:33:11.200
Good to see you.

01:33:11.300 --> 01:33:12.400
My goodness.

01:33:22.300 --> 01:33:24.400
There's nothing like an old Victrola.

01:33:25.300 --> 01:33:29.200
Mmm-mmm-mmm.

01:33:29.300 --> 01:33:31.399
I was just about to make my rounds.

01:33:31.400 --> 01:33:35.200
But first we have a drink, huh?

01:33:36.300 --> 01:33:40.499
And then we'll have a walk,

01:33:40.500 --> 01:33:43.500
talk, a smoke,

01:33:44.300 --> 01:33:45.400
and then...

01:33:47.300 --> 01:33:50.200
...we will eat, huh?

01:33:50.300 --> 01:33:52.300
Ricardito.

01:33:54.200 --> 01:33:55.399
Isn't this beautiful?

01:33:55.400 --> 01:34:00.199
It's a little behind, yes,

01:34:00.200 --> 01:34:04.200
but it shows great promise.

01:34:04.300 --> 01:34:07.300
The day I die...

01:34:07.400 --> 01:34:10.200
all of this will be yours.

01:34:10.300 --> 01:34:12.199
No, it won't.

01:34:12.200 --> 01:34:15.200
Yes, it will, but after I die.

01:34:15.400 --> 01:34:16.300
Ha ha.

01:34:16.400 --> 01:34:19.199
You don't understand. It
belongs to the revolution.

01:34:19.200 --> 01:34:22.200
The revolution will pass, believe me.

01:34:24.300 --> 01:34:28.299
I've seen it all before.

01:34:28.300 --> 01:34:32.300
Menocal, Machado, Batista...

01:34:33.200 --> 01:34:35.300
Where are they now?

01:34:38.400 --> 01:34:39.400
Gone.

01:34:42.300 --> 01:34:44.399
Fidel Castro will pass, too.

01:34:44.400 --> 01:34:49.200
But the land...

01:34:49.300 --> 01:34:52.400
the land, it will endure.

01:34:52.500 --> 01:34:55.400
Fidel Castro sent me personally

01:34:55.500 --> 01:34:57.299
to take vacant possession of this land.

01:34:57.300 --> 01:34:58.300
What are you talking about?

01:34:58.400 --> 01:34:59.400
I'm here too evict you.

01:34:59.500 --> 01:35:03.199
Would you repeat that to me, please?

01:35:03.200 --> 01:35:04.299
This farm is now property of the state.

01:35:04.300 --> 01:35:05.400
I am here to legally inform you

01:35:06.300 --> 01:35:07.300
that you must leave immediately.

01:35:07.400 --> 01:35:12.300
What did you just say to me, nephew?

01:35:13.200 --> 01:35:15.399
Godson.

01:35:15.400 --> 01:35:17.299
My blood!

01:35:17.300 --> 01:35:19.400
How dare you come to my house

01:35:19.500 --> 01:35:24.199
and tell me to get out?

01:35:24.200 --> 01:35:27.300
Have you no shame?

01:35:28.200 --> 01:35:30.299
You really think I'm
going to leave my house?

01:35:30.300 --> 01:35:33.400
My land?

01:35:34.200 --> 01:35:38.199
I have worked this earth too
hard with my bare hands

01:35:38.200 --> 01:35:40.200
to let some Fidelistas take it from me!

01:35:40.300 --> 01:35:41.300
Listen, you have to understand,

01:35:41.500 --> 01:35:42.400
this is the future now.

01:35:42.500 --> 01:35:43.400
The future?

01:35:43.500 --> 01:35:45.200
Yes, the future.

01:35:45.300 --> 01:35:46.400
Piss on your future!

01:35:46.500 --> 01:35:50.200
I spit on your future!

01:35:50.300 --> 01:35:52.300
Let them try and take it.

01:35:52.400 --> 01:35:55.300
You just let them try!

01:35:57.300 --> 01:35:58.499
Take it easy.

01:35:58.500 --> 01:36:00.299
Where is your sense of

01:36:00.300 --> 01:36:02.499
ohh! Aah...

01:36:02.500 --> 01:36:03.400
ohh...

01:36:04.300 --> 01:36:06.399
Where is your sense of.

01:36:06.400 --> 01:36:07.400
Are you okay?

01:36:07.401 --> 01:36:09.400
...family?

01:36:14.300 --> 01:36:17.299
Help! Help!

01:36:17.300 --> 01:36:18.300
Dono, put your head up.

01:36:18.400 --> 01:36:20.399
Put your head up. Put your head.

01:36:20.400 --> 01:36:23.200
Help me! Help!

01:36:27.200 --> 01:36:30.400
Help! Help!

01:36:38.500 --> 01:36:40.400
Hello, Father.

01:36:40.500 --> 01:36:42.400
Hi, son.

01:36:44.400 --> 01:36:50.299
What a great thing to hear.

01:36:50.300 --> 01:36:53.400
No one comes to say hello these days.

01:36:54.300 --> 01:36:56.300
Just good-bye.

01:37:00.400 --> 01:37:01.499
I'm so sorry.

01:37:01.500 --> 01:37:04.399
Yeah, well...

01:37:04.400 --> 01:37:06.300
my brother's resting in peace,

01:37:06.500 --> 01:37:12.200
and Ricardo, unfortunately...

01:37:12.400 --> 01:37:15.399
will have to live with the
consequences of his actions.

01:37:15.400 --> 01:37:20.199
And that's very sad.

01:37:20.200 --> 01:37:23.200
But, uh...

01:37:23.400 --> 01:37:26.300
I would like to talk about you.

01:37:27.200 --> 01:37:28.400
I remember what you said about
the moneylenders in the temple.

01:37:28.500 --> 01:37:30.299
Yeah.

01:37:30.300 --> 01:37:34.199
Well, the self-proclaimed Christ is here,

01:37:34.200 --> 01:37:35.200
and he's all whip.

01:37:35.300 --> 01:37:36.400
I know.

01:37:37.200 --> 01:37:39.400
Federico.

01:37:41.400 --> 01:37:43.200
Yeah.

01:37:43.400 --> 01:37:48.499
Your mother and I...
are worried about you.

01:37:48.500 --> 01:37:51.399
Now we think you should
be leaving the country.

01:37:51.400 --> 01:37:53.299
My place is here with both of you.

01:37:53.300 --> 01:37:54.300
Listen to me.

01:37:54.500 --> 01:37:56.400
No. I'm not gonna leave,

01:37:57.300 --> 01:37:58.200
unless you're gonna come with me.

01:37:58.201 --> 01:38:00.200
Listen to me.

01:38:00.400 --> 01:38:03.399
Listen to me.

01:38:03.400 --> 01:38:08.300
In life, you have to know when to arrive,

01:38:09.200 --> 01:38:11.400
but you have to know when to leave.

01:38:13.400 --> 01:38:16.199
And you should be leaving to a place

01:38:16.200 --> 01:38:19.199
where you can express yourself freely,

01:38:19.200 --> 01:38:21.300
not like here.

01:38:24.300 --> 01:38:26.400
And this will fill our hearts with hope.

01:38:27.300 --> 01:38:31.200
We'll be fine, Fico. We'll be fine.

01:38:40.400 --> 01:38:43.199
I have left you very little, my son.

01:38:43.200 --> 01:38:45.300
How can you say that?

01:38:45.400 --> 01:38:47.299
You've given me the
wealth of your example.

01:38:47.300 --> 01:38:49.300
That's all I need.

01:38:51.400 --> 01:38:56.300
Remember that the future
of our familyâ€™s with you.

01:39:01.200 --> 01:39:04.300
You know... in Cuba,

01:39:04.400 --> 01:39:07.400
we have always had plenty of light.

01:39:12.400 --> 01:39:16.200
We have never had
darkness at noon before.

01:39:23.200 --> 01:39:26.200
You are my pride and my joy.

01:39:33.400 --> 01:39:35.399
I'm going to do something I did to you

01:39:35.400 --> 01:39:37.400
when you were a little boy.

01:39:38.300 --> 01:39:39.400
This.

01:39:45.200 --> 01:39:46.200
Nothing there, huh?

01:39:46.201 --> 01:39:47.399
I'm sorry.

01:39:47.400 --> 01:39:49.200
I'm sorry.

01:41:33.200 --> 01:41:34.400
How could you?

01:41:34.500 --> 01:41:36.400
Look at me!

01:41:57.300 --> 01:42:02.399
What has become of you, Ricardo?

01:42:02.400 --> 01:42:05.399
You betray your country.

01:42:05.400 --> 01:42:10.200
You disgraced your family.

01:42:15.400 --> 01:42:17.500
You are lost, my son.

01:42:21.400 --> 01:42:24.400
Yes, you are.

01:42:39.400 --> 01:42:41.300
Fico.

01:43:12.400 --> 01:43:14.399
I wish I could go back to the beginning.

01:43:14.400 --> 01:43:17.300
Mmm, I love beginnings.

01:43:17.400 --> 01:43:18.400
Why's that?

01:43:18.401 --> 01:43:20.399
Nothing's happened yet.

01:43:20.400 --> 01:43:24.400
Anticipation is in the air. Optimism.

01:43:29.400 --> 01:43:31.300
What about the end?

01:43:31.400 --> 01:43:34.200
Well, they don't call
it the end for nothing.

01:43:34.300 --> 01:43:37.200
I hate endings...

01:43:37.300 --> 01:43:39.299
unless, of course, your
end is your beginning,

01:43:39.300 --> 01:43:42.199
Which makes your beginning your end.

01:43:42.200 --> 01:43:44.300
Then I would love the end.

01:43:44.400 --> 01:43:47.300
Where are we now?

01:43:48.200 --> 01:43:51.299
If you don't know where you are,

01:43:51.300 --> 01:43:53.300
then you are in the middle.

01:43:53.500 --> 01:43:55.300
No doubt about that.

01:45:21.200 --> 01:45:23.400
There goes my swing vote.

01:45:30.400 --> 01:45:34.200
Friends, I have an important
announcement to make.

01:45:34.400 --> 01:45:37.300
There's no dessert.

01:45:39.300 --> 01:45:42.299
Food rationing.

01:45:42.300 --> 01:45:43.400
Would you mind?

01:45:48.300 --> 01:45:53.199
And now a few brief words
from the man with no name?

01:45:53.200 --> 01:45:54.500
I'll be brief.

01:45:59.500 --> 01:46:03.300
Ladies and gentlemen...

01:46:05.400 --> 01:46:09.299
our Federico Fellove is
going away for good.

01:46:09.300 --> 01:46:11.399
Being a writer, I stress the word good

01:46:11.400 --> 01:46:14.200
because I think it will
be good for him...

01:46:14.300 --> 01:46:17.200
and good for us, too.

01:46:17.300 --> 01:46:20.200
Fico is going to New York City...

01:46:20.400 --> 01:46:23.399
the Mecca of show business...

01:46:23.400 --> 01:46:25.400
Where I'm gonna be
headin' for eventually.

01:46:28.200 --> 01:46:30.399
Fico, I know you're gonna be there

01:46:30.400 --> 01:46:32.199
to welcome us with open arms

01:46:32.200 --> 01:46:36.200
as you have so many times in the past.

01:46:49.300 --> 01:46:51.300
Ladies and gentlemen...

01:46:51.400 --> 01:46:53.400
the writer, for the
first time, speechless.

01:46:56.400 --> 01:46:59.200
I'll bail you out.

01:46:59.400 --> 01:47:00.300
I'd like to say something.

01:47:01.200 --> 01:47:02.400
Please.

01:47:08.300 --> 01:47:11.199
I wanna say that this, uh...

01:47:11.200 --> 01:47:14.400
this moment here means
a great deal to me...

01:47:14.500 --> 01:47:17.400
and I'm gonna treasure this forever.

01:47:22.200 --> 01:47:23.300
Salud.

01:47:27.300 --> 01:47:31.200
Forever is a very long time, Fico.

01:47:38.200 --> 01:47:40.200
It's all right. He's with me.

01:47:57.200 --> 01:47:59.199
Would you like a drink?

01:47:59.200 --> 01:48:00.499
No, I'm driving.

01:48:00.500 --> 01:48:03.299
I thought you came in a taxi.

01:48:03.300 --> 01:48:05.299
I'm driving the taxi.

01:48:05.300 --> 01:48:06.399
Very funny.

01:48:06.400 --> 01:48:08.299
Most things are these days.

01:48:08.300 --> 01:48:10.400
I need to speak to you alone.

01:48:23.300 --> 01:48:26.299
I have an exit visa.

01:48:26.300 --> 01:48:27.300
I'm leaving.

01:48:27.400 --> 01:48:30.199
What did you say? You heard what I said.

01:48:30.200 --> 01:48:32.300
I'm leaving the country.

01:48:32.500 --> 01:48:34.400
I want you to come with me.

01:48:35.300 --> 01:48:36.200
To go where?

01:48:36.300 --> 01:48:38.299
Anywhere but here. It doesn't matter.

01:48:38.300 --> 01:48:39.500
We can start again.

01:48:40.300 --> 01:48:44.199
Fico, I have a duty to my country.

01:48:44.200 --> 01:48:46.299
It is what Luis died for.

01:48:46.300 --> 01:48:50.300
Luis Luis died for Cuba.
He didn't die for Fidel.

01:48:54.200 --> 01:48:57.200
For the first time in my life,

01:48:57.300 --> 01:48:59.300
I feel I'm part of something important.

01:49:02.200 --> 01:49:05.200
I feel I can make a difference.

01:49:05.400 --> 01:49:07.300
We're fighting the just cause.

01:49:07.500 --> 01:49:09.299
In a ruthless and undemocratic manner.

01:49:09.300 --> 01:49:11.499
We have to make our reforms first.

01:49:11.500 --> 01:49:13.299
Democracy will come later.

01:49:13.300 --> 01:49:14.400
Then why not the other way around?

01:49:15.300 --> 01:49:16.399
I don't want to argue with you.

01:49:16.400 --> 01:49:19.299
Never you.

01:49:19.300 --> 01:49:22.399
Why don't you give us a chance?

01:49:22.400 --> 01:49:25.299
Us? Us as in us?

01:49:25.300 --> 01:49:27.399
Orus as in you and the cause calibre?

01:49:27.400 --> 01:49:29.200
Don't be angry with me.

01:49:29.300 --> 01:49:32.399
No, anger would be too simple.

01:49:32.400 --> 01:49:34.200
You must know that I love you.

01:49:35.400 --> 01:49:37.300
That's the complicated part.

01:49:38.400 --> 01:49:40.199
I'm sorry, Senora Fellove.

01:49:40.200 --> 01:49:43.299
The Commandante Guevara and the
Soviet ambassador want to see you.

01:49:43.300 --> 01:49:46.200
It seems urgent.

01:49:47.400 --> 01:49:49.299
Please stay.

01:49:49.300 --> 01:49:51.300
Why do you have to leave?

01:49:51.400 --> 01:49:53.200
Please.

01:50:14.400 --> 01:50:17.400
Miss Fellove, this is
the Soviet ambassador.

01:50:19.400 --> 01:50:21.200
That is all you're ever gonna get.

01:50:21.400 --> 01:50:23.399
What? It's not included in the deal?

01:50:23.400 --> 01:50:25.399
Yes.

01:50:25.400 --> 01:50:27.200
Let's go. Come on. Let's go.

01:50:27.400 --> 01:50:30.300
What are you doing?

01:50:31.200 --> 01:50:32.399
You're embarrassing me.

01:50:32.400 --> 01:50:34.300
This gathering is an embarrassment.

01:50:34.400 --> 01:50:36.199
Get your hands off me.

01:50:36.200 --> 01:50:37.200
Get you hands off me!

01:50:37.200 --> 01:50:38.200
Take your hands off me.

01:50:38.201 --> 01:50:39.400
You have something to say?

01:50:41.300 --> 01:50:43.300
Comrade...

01:50:43.500 --> 01:50:46.300
the dance floor is yours.

01:50:57.500 --> 01:51:01.299
To Luis Fellove...

01:51:01.300 --> 01:51:04.299
Who died for a dream,

01:51:04.300 --> 01:51:07.400
a dream of a pluralistic
and democratic Cuba!

01:51:11.300 --> 01:51:13.400
Long live a free Cuba.

01:51:22.300 --> 01:51:23.300
Let's go.

01:51:26.400 --> 01:51:28.299
Long live a free Cuba.

01:51:28.300 --> 01:51:30.200
Long live a free Cuba.

01:51:33.200 --> 01:51:34.300
Fico, wait.

01:51:34.400 --> 01:51:35.400
I can't leave.

01:51:35.401 --> 01:51:39.400
We must leave before it's
too late to get out.

01:51:40.300 --> 01:51:41.399
Try and understand.

01:51:41.400 --> 01:51:43.200
Try to understand?

01:51:43.300 --> 01:51:48.199
I understand that I'm lost without you.

01:51:48.200 --> 01:51:49.299
This is bigger than us.

01:51:49.300 --> 01:51:51.400
There is nothing bigger than us.

01:51:52.300 --> 01:51:54.200
Listen to me.

01:51:54.300 --> 01:51:57.300
Can't you see what's happening?

01:51:57.500 --> 01:52:00.299
You're being taken advantage of.

01:52:00.300 --> 01:52:02.299
Is that what you want?

01:52:02.300 --> 01:52:05.399
You want to be told what to
think the rest of your life?

01:52:05.400 --> 01:52:09.200
Because there's no end to this.

01:52:09.300 --> 01:52:12.300
This is madness.

01:52:12.400 --> 01:52:14.400
You deserve more. We deserve more.

01:52:18.300 --> 01:52:22.200
If you stay, your life
will not belong to you.

01:52:23.500 --> 01:52:25.300
Please.

01:52:28.400 --> 01:52:30.300
Come with me.

01:52:39.500 --> 01:52:41.400
Please.

01:52:44.400 --> 01:52:46.400
We're all that's left of our family.

01:52:50.400 --> 01:52:52.299
In time, you'll understand.

01:52:52.300 --> 01:52:54.300
There's no more time.

01:53:00.400 --> 01:53:02.400
Here's your exit visa.

01:53:05.200 --> 01:53:08.300
I'm leaving tomorrow at
5:00 in the afternoon.

01:54:13.300 --> 01:54:14.300
Comrade, companero.

01:54:15.400 --> 01:54:16.499
I salute you.

01:54:16.500 --> 01:54:18.399
On behalf of our maximum leader

01:54:18.400 --> 01:54:21.200
and all Communists in Cuba, welcome!
Bienvenido!

01:54:37.400 --> 01:54:41.299
Federico Junior.

01:54:41.300 --> 01:54:44.300
I want you to have this.

01:54:47.400 --> 01:54:50.299
You will need it on the day where...

01:54:50.300 --> 01:54:54.300
when what is left of our family...

01:54:54.400 --> 01:54:57.399
be reunited.

01:54:57.400 --> 01:54:59.299
That's for you. Mother and I.

01:54:59.300 --> 01:55:02.299
Just don't worry because
well be right here.

01:55:02.300 --> 01:55:04.399
We're strong people.

01:55:04.400 --> 01:55:07.299
We're gonna be right here...

01:55:07.300 --> 01:55:09.400
waiting for you.

01:55:09.500 --> 01:55:12.299
We'll have dinner together.

01:55:12.300 --> 01:55:16.400
Uh, but what is very important...

01:55:17.300 --> 01:55:19.400
At 6, okay?

01:55:19.500 --> 01:55:20.400
Sharp.

01:55:20.500 --> 01:55:22.400
Not a minute afterwards.

01:55:22.500 --> 01:55:24.300
That's my boy.

01:55:42.300 --> 01:55:45.199
Yeah. That's it.

01:55:45.200 --> 01:55:50.100
There. Lt fits you as well
as it fits your father.

01:55:50.200 --> 01:55:51.299
Are you kidding?

01:55:51.300 --> 01:55:53.299
Much better.

01:55:53.300 --> 01:55:54.500
Look at him.

01:56:08.300 --> 01:56:11.200
I'm gonna send for you as soon as I can.

01:56:14.400 --> 01:56:16.400
Bye.

01:56:26.400 --> 01:56:29.300
It's all okay.

01:56:43.200 --> 01:56:44.300
God bless you.

01:56:53.200 --> 01:56:54.200
I gotta go.

01:56:54.201 --> 01:56:55.300
Okay.

01:56:58.400 --> 01:57:00.200
We'll be here.

01:58:32.300 --> 01:58:33.400
Let's go!

01:58:33.500 --> 01:58:34.400
Next.

01:58:38.300 --> 01:58:39.300
What's in the bag?

01:58:39.301 --> 01:58:40.399
Only what I need.

01:58:40.400 --> 01:58:42.200
Open it.

01:58:52.300 --> 01:58:54.300
Man of taste.

01:58:56.300 --> 01:58:57.399
What's this?

01:58:57.400 --> 01:59:00.299
Home movies. There's my camera.

01:59:00.300 --> 01:59:02.300
Open it.

01:59:06.300 --> 01:59:09.400
I wanna photograph the
injustice of American life.

01:59:13.300 --> 01:59:14.400
Stretch out your arms.

01:59:19.200 --> 01:59:21.200
Empty your pockets.

01:59:24.300 --> 01:59:27.200
Ring and watch, take them off.

01:59:34.500 --> 01:59:36.299
Put it in here.

01:59:36.300 --> 01:59:38.300
Sir?

01:59:45.300 --> 01:59:47.300
Inside.

01:59:49.300 --> 01:59:50.200
Take it off.

01:59:55.400 --> 01:59:58.299
This watch belonged to my father.

01:59:58.300 --> 02:00:00.200
Belonged is correct.

02:00:00.300 --> 02:00:01.400
In here.

02:00:04.500 --> 02:00:07.299
What's this?

02:00:07.300 --> 02:00:08.300
A memento.

02:00:08.301 --> 02:00:09.400
Hmm.

02:00:10.300 --> 02:00:13.299
You worms are strange.

02:00:13.300 --> 02:00:16.300
Not yet gone, and you're
already carrying souvenirs.

02:00:18.300 --> 02:00:21.400
You can't take Cuba with you, you know.

02:00:21.500 --> 02:00:23.300
Free to go.

02:00:24.400 --> 02:00:26.200
Next.

02:02:15.200 --> 02:02:17.299
This is Willis Conover
of the Voice of America

02:02:17.300 --> 02:02:19.299
bringing you The Music of Freedom.

02:02:19.300 --> 02:02:22.199
For those of you in limbo
out there, here is the Duke

02:02:22.200 --> 02:02:24.199
and saxophone is Coleman Hawkins.

02:02:24.200 --> 02:02:26.300
With Limbo Jazz.

02:03:11.400 --> 02:03:13.300
Who is it?

02:03:13.400 --> 02:03:15.300
Room service.

02:03:28.200 --> 02:03:29.300
So when did you leave?

02:03:31.400 --> 02:03:34.199
Better ask when did I escape.

02:03:34.200 --> 02:03:37.300
Semantics, my friend,
is made up of antics.

02:03:38.400 --> 02:03:40.400
I'm glad to see you.

02:03:42.200 --> 02:03:44.200
It can only mean that you're lonely.

02:03:44.400 --> 02:03:46.499
Lonely is the best word.

02:03:46.500 --> 02:03:48.400
When a man is truly lonely,

02:03:48.500 --> 02:03:51.200
even a light bulb is good company.

02:03:53.300 --> 02:03:56.199
Actually, I'm masquerading as an exile.

02:03:56.200 --> 02:03:58.299
Well, your impersonation is quite good.

02:03:58.300 --> 02:03:59.300
I'm still in Cuba.

02:04:00.500 --> 02:04:02.500
Where do you think I am, Jersey City?

02:04:08.200 --> 02:04:10.299
Joe DiMaggio.

02:04:10.300 --> 02:04:12.400
Minnie Minoso.

02:04:17.400 --> 02:04:18.400
He looks in.

02:04:18.500 --> 02:04:21.400
Yeah, you latched on that one.

02:04:25.300 --> 02:04:27.300
Hmm, where we going?

02:04:27.500 --> 02:04:28.400
El Dragon Rojo,

02:04:28.500 --> 02:04:31.400
a Cuban-Chinese restaurant
which is neither.

02:04:31.500 --> 02:04:34.300
But they are under the
illusion I'm a writer.

02:04:34.400 --> 02:04:35.400
Madam.

02:04:37.300 --> 02:04:38.200
Oh, madam.

02:04:38.400 --> 02:04:40.399
What would you like today?

02:04:40.400 --> 02:04:42.200
My usual please.

02:04:42.400 --> 02:04:43.400
Beluga caviar to start.

02:04:43.401 --> 02:04:45.399
For an entre, pheasant tongues

02:04:45.400 --> 02:04:47.399
marinated in vin de sauternes.

02:04:47.400 --> 02:04:48.400
Smyrna figs for dessert,

02:04:49.300 --> 02:04:50.200
and a bottle of Veuve Cliquot

02:04:50.201 --> 02:04:52.500
chilled, not merely cold, please.

02:04:53.300 --> 02:04:55.399
Fried rice and bananas for two.

02:04:55.400 --> 02:04:57.299
Yes, the special, please,
but bring it right away.

02:04:57.300 --> 02:04:59.399
We haven't eaten since the revolution.

02:04:59.400 --> 02:05:03.200
Did you know that Cuba is half white,

02:05:03.300 --> 02:05:05.400
half black, and half Chinese?

02:05:06.200 --> 02:05:07.300
That's three halves.

02:05:07.400 --> 02:05:09.400
Everything is coming in threes
these days, even halves.

02:05:10.300 --> 02:05:11.300
Which half are you?

02:05:11.301 --> 02:05:13.300
Half owner.

02:05:16.300 --> 02:05:17.400
Should have been a stand-up comedian.

02:05:18.200 --> 02:05:20.200
I may hold you to that.

02:05:20.300 --> 02:05:21.200
I can't help you.

02:05:21.300 --> 02:05:23.200
I'm just a former cabaret owner.

02:05:23.300 --> 02:05:25.199
Once a cabaret owner,
always a cabaret owner.

02:05:25.200 --> 02:05:28.200
Oris it once a former cabaret owner,

02:05:28.300 --> 02:05:30.400
always a former cabaret owner?

02:05:45.200 --> 02:05:47.199
Fico.

02:05:47.200 --> 02:05:48.300
Take a break, chico.

02:05:48.400 --> 02:05:50.300
Time to suffer.

02:05:50.400 --> 02:05:52.399
Good one.

02:05:52.400 --> 02:05:53.400
Thank you.

02:05:53.400 --> 02:05:54.400
Ahem.

02:05:56.300 --> 02:05:57.200
Thank you.

02:05:57.300 --> 02:05:58.200
Look, Fico,

02:05:58.300 --> 02:06:00.199
I've been...

02:06:00.200 --> 02:06:01.400
I've been thinking.

02:06:06.400 --> 02:06:10.399
You know, it bothers me

02:06:10.400 --> 02:06:13.399
to see you, Fico Fellove,

02:06:13.400 --> 02:06:15.199
Working in the kitchen.

02:06:15.200 --> 02:06:16.299
Nonsense.

02:06:16.300 --> 02:06:18.400
Now, I've told you before
I appreciate the work.

02:06:19.300 --> 02:06:21.399
Well, anyway, I was thinking.

02:06:21.400 --> 02:06:25.299
What if I set up a piano in the cafe?

02:06:25.300 --> 02:06:27.300
Would you be interested in...

02:06:29.300 --> 02:06:32.499
Unfortunately, the pay would be the same,

02:06:32.500 --> 02:06:35.300
but plus tips.

02:06:35.400 --> 02:06:37.399
Whatever you need. Hmm?

02:06:37.400 --> 02:06:39.200
You know I appreciate it.

02:06:39.400 --> 02:06:40.300
Mm.

02:06:40.400 --> 02:06:42.200
I'd like to keep this job, too.

02:06:42.400 --> 02:06:43.300
I need the extra money.

02:06:43.400 --> 02:06:44.400
I'm trying to bring my family.

02:06:45.200 --> 02:06:47.200
Enough said. Enough said.

02:06:47.400 --> 02:06:48.300
To free Cuba.

02:06:48.400 --> 02:06:50.300
Salud. Salud.

02:06:58.500 --> 02:07:01.400
The present you are living in is so thin,

02:07:01.500 --> 02:07:03.400
you could squeeze it underneath a door.

02:07:03.500 --> 02:07:06.299
The trouble with exile is exile.

02:07:06.300 --> 02:07:07.300
Thank you.

02:07:07.301 --> 02:07:09.200
I have a solution.

02:07:09.400 --> 02:07:13.199
This pretty lady's torch
is Aladdin's lamp.

02:07:13.200 --> 02:07:16.199
Aladdin's lamp.

02:07:16.200 --> 02:07:18.199
And it will grant any wish in your life.

02:07:18.200 --> 02:07:19.299
I wish I could relive it.

02:07:19.300 --> 02:07:22.300
You can by rebuilding it.

02:07:22.400 --> 02:07:24.400
Will you work for me?

02:07:25.300 --> 02:07:28.300
Free drinks?

02:07:28.400 --> 02:07:29.400
Done.

02:07:32.400 --> 02:07:35.300
Gentlemen, time to suffer.

02:07:44.300 --> 02:07:46.300
The door was open.

02:07:48.300 --> 02:07:49.400
You know, the thing I
love most about New York

02:07:50.300 --> 02:07:53.399
is that you're always
running into old friends.

02:07:53.400 --> 02:07:56.300
You know why we're friends?

02:07:59.500 --> 02:08:01.400
Because we don't believe in coincidences.

02:08:01.500 --> 02:08:03.300
Please sit down.

02:08:20.200 --> 02:08:21.400
You may consider me an enemy,

02:08:21.500 --> 02:08:24.399
but I've always considered
you a friend, Federico.

02:08:24.400 --> 02:08:28.299
I may at times have lost
my patience at times,

02:08:28.300 --> 02:08:30.299
but never with a man I respect

02:08:30.300 --> 02:08:32.300
and that respects me in kind.

02:08:35.300 --> 02:08:37.199
How we doing there, Joe?

02:08:37.200 --> 02:08:39.299
Flirting. Good.

02:08:39.300 --> 02:08:40.300
Take your hat off.

02:08:44.300 --> 02:08:47.399
Ah, she was a beautiful thing, Havana.

02:08:47.400 --> 02:08:50.199
We should have known she was a...

02:08:50.200 --> 02:08:51.300
a heartbreaker.

02:08:54.200 --> 02:08:56.200
And here we are.

02:08:56.300 --> 02:08:58.400
It's bashert destiny.

02:09:02.500 --> 02:09:04.499
Now, listen.

02:09:04.500 --> 02:09:06.399
Listen hard.

02:09:06.400 --> 02:09:08.400
I didn't bomb your place, kid.

02:09:08.500 --> 02:09:09.400
That's not my style.

02:09:16.300 --> 02:09:17.400
Okay?

02:09:19.400 --> 02:09:21.200
May I have an egg cream?

02:09:21.300 --> 02:09:23.200
Chocolate syrup, cold milk.

02:09:23.400 --> 02:09:25.300
Spritz the seltzer until
it foams up over the top.

02:09:25.400 --> 02:09:26.400
No.

02:09:27.300 --> 02:09:28.200
And a bit of rum, yes?

02:09:28.300 --> 02:09:29.400
Yeah. An egg cream.

02:09:33.300 --> 02:09:34.500
What's your name?

02:09:35.300 --> 02:09:37.400
I never thought you'd ask.

02:09:39.200 --> 02:09:41.199
My offer's still open.

02:09:41.200 --> 02:09:44.399
A new club. Las Vegas.

02:09:44.400 --> 02:09:46.300
Nevada. No humidity.

02:09:46.400 --> 02:09:49.199
Don't answer. Think about it.

02:09:49.200 --> 02:09:50.300
You know?

02:09:50.400 --> 02:09:53.299
You know, even in rejection

02:09:53.300 --> 02:09:56.399
lead me on a little bit, hmm?

02:09:56.400 --> 02:09:59.399
Don't break my heart...

02:09:59.400 --> 02:10:01.200
just yet.

02:10:05.400 --> 02:10:08.199
You like egg cream.

02:10:08.200 --> 02:10:10.199
Yes, I like egg creams.

02:10:10.200 --> 02:10:13.300
And I'm not crazy about humidity, either.

02:10:18.300 --> 02:10:21.400
You give my regards to your family.

02:10:25.300 --> 02:10:28.399
You have the ingredients right.

02:10:28.400 --> 02:10:30.500
There's an art with the seltzer spritz.

02:10:31.200 --> 02:10:32.399
Your chocolate goes at the bottom.

02:10:32.400 --> 02:10:34.199
With milk over it,

02:10:34.200 --> 02:10:36.199
and then you spritz straight down,

02:10:36.200 --> 02:10:39.200
but then you spritz around the glass

02:10:39.400 --> 02:10:41.400
until it rises to the top.

02:10:43.300 --> 02:10:45.199
Always a pleasure, Lansky.

02:10:45.200 --> 02:10:47.200
I mean Mr. Meyer. Love your wieners.

02:10:54.300 --> 02:10:55.400
Bueno, Fico. Good night.

02:10:56.300 --> 02:10:57.300
Okay, have a good time.

02:10:57.301 --> 02:11:00.299
Keys are in the back. Have a good time.

02:11:00.300 --> 02:11:02.400
Good night, Mrs. Calabash,
wherever you are.

02:11:02.500 --> 02:11:05.300
Gentlemen, don't burn the place down.

02:11:32.200 --> 02:11:34.199
Did you ever have the feeling

02:11:34.200 --> 02:11:35.300
that you wanted to go?

02:11:38.200 --> 02:11:39.300
Did you ever have the feeling

02:11:39.400 --> 02:11:41.199
that you wanted to stay?

02:11:41.200 --> 02:11:45.299
Go, stay, go, stay, go...

02:11:45.300 --> 02:11:47.299
ooh.

02:11:47.300 --> 02:11:49.400
That's a go, isn't it?

02:11:51.500 --> 02:11:54.299
Madam, always a pleasure.

02:11:54.300 --> 02:11:56.300
Give my regards to the pigeons.

02:12:12.400 --> 02:12:13.400
Why are you here?

02:12:13.500 --> 02:12:17.300
I'm here...

02:12:17.400 --> 02:12:19.400
with our dedication to United Nations.

02:12:23.400 --> 02:12:25.400
Do you have time for some coffee?

02:12:43.300 --> 02:12:44.300
I'm sorry you left.

02:12:46.400 --> 02:12:48.399
There was nothing left for me in Havana.

02:12:48.400 --> 02:12:51.199
Yes, I know.

02:12:51.200 --> 02:12:52.200
You lost your club.

02:12:52.300 --> 02:12:54.299
No, that's not what I meant.

02:12:54.300 --> 02:12:56.299
You sound bitter.

02:12:56.300 --> 02:12:58.399
Not at all.

02:12:58.400 --> 02:13:00.300
I have no money...

02:13:02.400 --> 02:13:05.299
but I feel...

02:13:05.300 --> 02:13:07.399
as though I'm worth more than I ever was.

02:13:07.400 --> 02:13:09.400
Would it do any good to say I'm sorry?

02:13:10.200 --> 02:13:11.299
No, not really.

02:13:11.300 --> 02:13:13.200
Try at least to understand me.

02:13:13.300 --> 02:13:16.199
I've understood more
than you could explain.

02:13:16.200 --> 02:13:19.399
Why don't you come back to Cuba with me?

02:13:19.400 --> 02:13:22.399
Because it's dangerous...

02:13:22.400 --> 02:13:24.199
for my soul.

02:13:24.200 --> 02:13:26.400
I see you still do not believe in causes.

02:13:30.400 --> 02:13:32.300
Well, I don't have a
loyalty to a lost cause.

02:13:35.500 --> 02:13:39.400
But I do have a loyalty to a lost city.

02:13:41.400 --> 02:13:44.400
And that's my cause and my curse.

02:13:45.200 --> 02:13:46.300
Please don't hate me, then.

02:13:46.400 --> 02:13:48.200
I'll never hate you.

02:13:55.500 --> 02:13:57.300
I'll always love you.

02:13:59.400 --> 02:14:01.400
Why can't you love me there?

02:14:01.500 --> 02:14:04.200
Too big of a price to pay.

02:14:23.200 --> 02:14:24.300
Be well.

02:14:28.400 --> 02:14:30.200
Stop crying.

02:14:34.300 --> 02:14:36.200
You can always love me here.

02:14:38.200 --> 02:14:39.200
Remember that.

02:14:47.400 --> 02:14:48.400
You're so beautiful.
