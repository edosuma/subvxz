[ Female Prosecutor ] I concur

[ Prosecutor ]
Ron Decker is intelligent.
He is from a good family,

02:26.347 --> 02:29.648
which gives him
even less excuse, since
he's had every opportunity.

02:29.650 --> 02:33.819

this was a hobby, which
counsel seems to imply.

with which he was caught--
Objection.

This is a serious offense.

And if someone who has had
every advantage and opportunity
doesn't go to prison,

02:47.601 --> 02:52.538

to send someone

blow out your candlelight.

one of the most...

Earl Copen had a set
of balls on him from the day
he come in this joint.

this boy one-on-one.

12:20.240 --> 12:25.110

and got one of them
big steel mop buckets.

12:25.112 --> 12:28.413

with water.

12:28.415 --> 12:30.815
When this motherfucker
was walkin' by,

12:30.817 --> 12:34.753
Earl aimed at it,
dropped it and let it go.

12:36.489 --> 12:38.423
Did it hit him?

12:38.425 --> 12:43.061
It didn't hit him on the head,
hit him on the foot,

for nearly six months.

his ass up too, after that.

in the dump ten miles
from here. Right?

01:20:17.180 --> 01:20:20.381
I thought the plan
was to get out alive?

01:20:20.383 --> 01:20:25.886
Listen, fuckhead.
The play is to dive in the back
with some kind of brace.

01:20:25.888 --> 01:20:31.425
What if it doesn't hold?
Then we're crushed
like bugs on a windshield.

01:20:31.427 --> 01:20:33.561
Nobody's ever tried this?

01:20:33.563 --> 01:20:37.064
No. Crusher stopped 'em.

01:20:44.139 --> 01:20:48.175
¶ I used to have a good job
way back when ¶

01:20:48.177 --> 01:20:52.613
¶ But I lost it
when they tossed my ass
in the pen ¶

01:20:52.615 --> 01:20:56.917
¶ But back in the joint
I learned to make
some moonshine ¶

01:20:56.919 --> 01:21:01.055
¶ Swear it tastes
just like cactus juice ¶

01:21:01.057 --> 01:21:04.925
¶ Why don't you lay

01:21:04.927 --> 01:21:07.494
¶ Why don't you
lay it on down ¶

01:21:07.496 --> 01:21:12.366
Ron and me,
we're taking off
the day after tomorrow.

01:21:12.368 --> 01:21:15.302
No shit?
Day after tomorrow?

01:21:15.304 --> 01:21:17.304
Like I told ya,
trash truck.

01:21:17.306 --> 01:21:20.274
Man, I'm fuckin' jealous.

01:21:20.276 --> 01:21:23.244
What I need is
for those two
trash truck swampers...

01:21:23.246 --> 01:21:25.412
to be told, you know,
what they should expect.

01:21:25.414 --> 01:21:29.316
-I can do that.
Me and Super Hunk.
-Who's clippin' the weight bar?

01:21:29.318 --> 01:21:32.286
Me and Jesse
can handle that.
[ T.J. ] Fuck, no.

01:21:32.288 --> 01:21:34.555
Got it worked out
with Ponchie already.

01:21:34.557 --> 01:21:37.524
Damn, I hope you guys make it.

01:21:37.526 --> 01:21:40.661
I'll tell those two
tomorrow night.
The later I wait, the better.

01:21:40.663 --> 01:21:43.430
Good.

01:21:43.432 --> 01:21:47.434
I'm gonna miss ya,
brother.

01:21:47.436 --> 01:21:51.272
Give me a hug, handsome.
[ Chuckling ]

01:21:51.274 --> 01:21:53.941
Boy, you better send me
a shit load of dope.

01:21:53.943 --> 01:21:55.542
First thing, man.

01:21:57.279 --> 01:22:01.348
¶ I went to the doctor
just to check myself in ¶

01:22:01.350 --> 01:22:05.986
¶ But I knew I'd go
right back at it again ¶

01:22:05.988 --> 01:22:10.457
¶ The doctor said
son, you got to quit
gettin' stoned-- ¶

01:22:10.459 --> 01:22:13.694
¶ I love to go swimmin'
with bare-naked women ¶

01:22:13.696 --> 01:22:16.397
¶ And glide between
their legs ¶

01:22:16.399 --> 01:22:19.967
¶ When I get under
It looks like thunder-- ¶

01:22:19.969 --> 01:22:22.436
[ Laughing ]

01:22:26.675 --> 01:22:30.577
Get some
of the smokes to T.J.
You can have the rest.

01:22:30.579 --> 01:22:35.983
These bonaroo shirts,
they'll fit Wayne.

01:22:35.985 --> 01:22:41.221
Some other shit in there
and my books,
give 'em to whoever wants 'em.

01:22:41.223 --> 01:22:44.191
Yeah, thanks.

01:22:44.193 --> 01:22:46.460
I hope
that fuckin' bar holds.

01:22:46.462 --> 01:22:50.998
I read the maintenance manual.
I think it should hold.

01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:54.635
You think?
No guarantees in life.

01:22:54.637 --> 01:22:58.405
You ain't goin'.

01:22:58.407 --> 01:23:00.307
I'm goin'.

01:23:02.310 --> 01:23:07.047
You're not gonna know
what to do with yourself
on the outside anymore.

01:23:11.353 --> 01:23:14.722
[ Banging Noise ]

01:23:14.724 --> 01:23:17.358
[ Men Shouting ]

01:23:38.380 --> 01:23:40.481
[ Bell Rings ]

01:23:42.117 --> 01:23:46.587
All right, line up.
Single file. Let's go.
Line up, come on.

01:23:56.331 --> 01:24:00.300
Earl! What the hell, man?
How could you still
be sleepin'?

01:24:00.302 --> 01:24:03.037
I was too nervous
not to.

01:24:03.039 --> 01:24:07.141
Look, we're
the first cell block out.

01:24:07.143 --> 01:24:09.643
The truck
won't start rolling
for at least an hour.

01:24:09.645 --> 01:24:12.646
Now go get some hot water.
I'll make some coffee.

01:24:12.648 --> 01:24:15.215
All right.

01:24:21.589 --> 01:24:26.560
Hey, Earl, Vito talked to
those guys on the trash truck.
Everything is cool.

01:24:26.562 --> 01:24:30.197
- Thanks, brother.
- Good luck.

01:24:37.839 --> 01:24:40.174
I gotta go back
to my cell.

01:24:40.176 --> 01:24:42.543
Why? Forget
your matching Samsonite?

01:24:42.545 --> 01:24:44.778
No, I gotta take a shit.

01:24:52.821 --> 01:24:54.822
[ Chattering ]

01:25:36.564 --> 01:25:39.600
Fuck, son of a bitch!

01:25:39.602 --> 01:25:42.603
Man, what?
Fuckin' weight bars,
they aren't here.

01:25:42.605 --> 01:25:45.706
I don't fuckin'
believe this!

01:25:45.708 --> 01:25:47.674
Fuck!

01:25:47.676 --> 01:25:51.411
[ Earl ] Son of a bitch.
Earl.
[ Whispering ]

01:26:04.726 --> 01:26:07.528
Shit!
Baby, baby, baby.

01:26:12.700 --> 01:26:14.902
Let's go.

01:26:52.574 --> 01:26:54.441
Go, go. Go.

01:27:03.284 --> 01:27:07.654
[ Guard ]
Hey, Marquez, did you take
my fuckin' cigarettes again?

01:27:07.656 --> 01:27:11.558
I'll have ya arrested, ya prick.
Trying to help me quit, huh?

01:29:42.009 --> 01:29:44.711
You'd have missed us too much
anyway, homes.

01:29:44.713 --> 01:29:48.014
Better to reign in hell
than serve in heaven,
right?

01:29:48.016 --> 01:29:50.016
Got that right.
