01:06.399 --> 01:11.637
The working men of God's
Pocket are simple men.

01:11.638 --> 01:14.940
They work. They follow their teams.

01:14.941 --> 01:20.110
They marry and have children
who rarely leave the Pocket.

01:21.448 --> 01:25.111
Everyone here has stolen
something from somebody else...

01:26.920 --> 01:30.685
or when they were kids, they
set someone's house on fire...

01:31.191 --> 01:35.430
or they ran away when they
should have stayed and fought.

01:38.465 --> 01:42.772
They know who cheats at cards
and who slaps their kids around.

01:45.505 --> 01:49.818
And no matter what anybody
does, they're still here.

01:50.243 --> 01:54.038
And whatever they
are is what they are.

01:56.450 --> 02:01.443
The only thing they can't forgive
is not being from God's Pocket.

02:15.068 --> 02:16.068
Say it.

02:16.069 --> 02:17.236
Say it.

02:17.237 --> 02:18.404
Oh, your balls.

02:18.405 --> 02:19.972
Oh... oh, my God.

02:19.973 --> 02:21.440
- Oh.
- Oh, my God.

02:21.441 --> 02:22.575
It's good, right?

02:22.576 --> 02:24.076
Oh, it's so good.

02:24.077 --> 02:26.136
- Oh!
- Your cook's so good.

02:34.788 --> 02:36.961
Mm.

02:43.163 --> 02:45.197
You okay?

02:45.198 --> 02:47.041
Great.

02:49.102 --> 02:50.336
Jeanie.

02:50.337 --> 02:52.638
Mickey, I know. You love me.

02:52.639 --> 02:54.584
I do.

02:57.144 --> 02:59.311
If Leon is going to work today,

02:59.312 --> 03:02.941
I got to be down at Bird's
by 8:00 if he wants a ride.

03:04.217 --> 03:06.583
Leon, honey, it's time for work.

03:08.121 --> 03:10.123
All right.

03:11.124 --> 03:15.117
Mickey's got to be to Bird's
by 8:00 if you want a ride.

03:16.830 --> 03:17.897
Honey?

03:17.898 --> 03:19.570
I'm up!

03:30.010 --> 03:33.345
"Everyone here has stolen
something from somebody else,

03:33.346 --> 03:36.048
or when they were kids, they
set someone's house on fire,

03:36.049 --> 03:39.518
or they ran away when they
should have stayed and fought."

03:39.519 --> 03:42.288
That Richard Shellburn's
got it right.

03:42.289 --> 03:44.790
I don't know why writing
down what everybody knows

03:44.791 --> 03:47.567
is any better than knowing
it in the first place.

03:48.862 --> 03:51.063
If you were from
here, you'd get it.

03:51.064 --> 03:53.555
That's what everyone tells me.

03:56.236 --> 03:59.414
I don't know how you eat that
shit and still look so good.

04:00.907 --> 04:04.013
You get sugar diabetes, they're
gonna cut your feet off.

04:11.852 --> 04:14.059
Fuck you looking at?

04:24.731 --> 04:26.972
Something to eat in the truck, hon.

04:40.413 --> 04:42.081
See, I told you it'd
take me no time at all.

04:42.082 --> 04:44.141
You got me ten minutes
late already.

04:49.156 --> 04:51.157
Fuckin'...fuck it.

04:51.158 --> 04:52.925
You mind spotting me 20 bucks?

04:52.926 --> 04:55.928
They start on one end, and
the air in Camden is so bad

04:55.929 --> 04:58.330
and it takes so fucking long
to get to the other end

04:58.331 --> 05:00.199
that by then, the
paint is all peeling,

05:00.200 --> 05:02.735
and they got to go back
and start all over again.

05:02.736 --> 05:08.374
Year after year, painting the same
fucking bridge over and over.

05:08.375 --> 05:09.775
It's like a nightmare.

05:09.776 --> 05:11.346
Ho!

05:12.546 --> 05:14.280
- You're late.
- I know. I'm sorry.

05:14.281 --> 05:17.057
Another five minutes, we was
gonna leave without you.

05:18.351 --> 05:19.955
"We"?

05:26.660 --> 05:30.095
This horse is a fantastic,
beautiful horse, talented horse.

05:30.096 --> 05:31.330
Hard for me to believe.

05:31.331 --> 05:33.199
I seen it myself in Florida.

05:33.200 --> 05:36.035
You're telling me there was something
wrong with the horse's pussy,

05:36.036 --> 05:38.003
made her quit 300
yards from the finish?

05:38.004 --> 05:41.874
Turning Leaf, her name was, and she
hit the stretch and just quit.

05:41.875 --> 05:46.545
Turns out she sucked up
air, you know, vaginally.

05:46.546 --> 05:48.948
A couple gallons of air
get trapped up in there,

05:48.949 --> 05:51.483
and she cramps up,
and she can't run...

05:51.484 --> 05:53.085
very uncommon.

05:53.086 --> 05:55.788
It's like running while you're
trying to take a shit, huh?

05:55.789 --> 05:58.057
It was the humidity.

05:58.058 --> 06:01.293
Horse like that runs up
here, she'd take the field.

06:01.294 --> 06:03.395
Let's go!

06:03.396 --> 06:06.365
I want to know what a white
man's doing walking...

06:08.568 --> 06:11.298
while this nigger is
riding around all day.

06:13.340 --> 06:15.820
Nothing personal, Lucy, huh?

06:21.348 --> 06:23.616
So I grab that fucking
cat by the tail, right?

06:23.617 --> 06:26.285
I hold him upside down,
and that little stewardess

06:26.286 --> 06:29.288
is screaming for me
to leave him alone,

06:29.289 --> 06:33.058
and I says, "I'll leave him
alone, all right," and...

06:33.059 --> 06:34.226
and I take my knife...

06:34.227 --> 06:36.695
Boy, you're about to figure
a way to wipe your ass

06:36.696 --> 06:38.994
with that razor, ain't you?

06:46.406 --> 06:48.852
I ain't said a word all morning.

06:56.650 --> 06:58.284
Which one is it?

06:58.285 --> 06:59.652
It's a green truck.

06:59.653 --> 07:02.588
I got a plate number
right over here.

07:02.589 --> 07:04.023
All these trucks are green.

07:04.024 --> 07:05.658
Yeah, but I got a
number right over here.

07:05.659 --> 07:06.992
It's gonna take a fucking month

07:06.993 --> 07:09.028
just to read the fucking
license plates on that one.

07:09.029 --> 07:10.095
Well, that ain't it.

07:10.096 --> 07:12.155
We're looking for a reefer.

07:13.466 --> 07:15.200
A refrigerated truck, you know,

07:15.201 --> 07:18.537
so the meat don't cook
on its way to Vermont.

07:18.538 --> 07:19.605
Mm-hmm.

07:19.606 --> 07:20.906
It's running.

07:20.907 --> 07:22.508
They don't shut them off.

07:22.509 --> 07:24.209
They're diesels.

07:24.210 --> 07:26.781
Keep them running
for weeks at a time.

07:27.847 --> 07:29.281
That's very interesting...

07:29.282 --> 07:31.250
the history of the
trucking industry.

07:31.251 --> 07:33.085
All right, stay here.
I'm gonna go take a piss.

07:33.086 --> 07:34.929
All right.

07:41.761 --> 07:43.762
Oh.

07:43.763 --> 07:46.065
What's Sal doing here?

07:46.066 --> 07:48.133
Doesn't take three
people to steal a truck.

07:48.134 --> 07:50.369
I owe him a little money.

07:50.370 --> 07:52.941
He just wants to make sure
everything goes down.

07:54.040 --> 07:55.441
Look at him over here.

07:55.442 --> 07:57.343
He's pissing on his shoes.

07:57.344 --> 07:58.377
Yeah.

07:58.378 --> 08:00.546
Why don't you tell him?

08:00.547 --> 08:04.085
He'll shoot you just to show
you he knows what he's doing.

08:10.423 --> 08:12.391
That's it right there.

08:25.505 --> 08:26.538
Hey.

08:26.539 --> 08:28.907
Yeah?

08:28.908 --> 08:32.684
Notice the whole world's got
a fucking attitude lately?

08:33.980 --> 08:37.182
Listen, you go in there, and you have
a nice breakfast, pal, all right?

08:37.183 --> 08:38.517
You take an hour. Understand?

08:38.518 --> 08:41.726
One hour before you come back
out here looking for your truck.

08:44.524 --> 08:46.583
Who's driving?

08:51.531 --> 08:53.260
You all right, pal?

08:54.100 --> 08:57.202
Look, you got your business.
We got ours.

08:57.203 --> 08:59.405
You take the money,
your business is over.

08:59.406 --> 09:01.106
Am I right or wrong?

09:01.107 --> 09:02.207
Huh?

09:02.208 --> 09:04.870
Okay, just take a
couple of deep breaths.

09:05.245 --> 09:06.879
Here's your hat, all right?

09:06.880 --> 09:07.913
Can you get up?

09:07.914 --> 09:10.758
And gonna have a nice
breakfast, just like I said.

09:11.751 --> 09:13.652
Come on.

09:13.653 --> 09:15.954
All of a sudden, the world
ain't got no attitude no more.

09:15.955 --> 09:17.832
What the fuck?

09:55.395 --> 09:58.091
Don't do it.

10:05.872 --> 10:07.739
Shit.

10:07.740 --> 10:11.005
Jesus Christ.

10:20.887 --> 10:22.798
Motherfucker.

10:24.958 --> 10:26.525
You shit yourself, Mickey?

10:26.526 --> 10:27.659
- Oh, yeah.
- Huh?

10:27.660 --> 10:29.094
Fuck you.

10:29.095 --> 10:31.630
I almost cut her tits
off after I, uh,

10:31.631 --> 10:34.233
took care of her fucking kid.

10:34.234 --> 10:36.301
I seen that happen to a girl once.

10:36.302 --> 10:37.503
Huh?

10:37.504 --> 10:39.138
Sliced and diced,
just right fuckin'...

10:39.139 --> 10:40.834
Bullsh-shit.

10:45.145 --> 10:46.478
What the fuck you say?

10:46.479 --> 10:49.653
I heard you talking about me.

10:51.951 --> 10:54.553
I don't give a shit personally,

10:54.554 --> 10:56.889
but I don't like a nigger
talking about my business.

10:56.890 --> 11:01.162
This old nigger's been talking
about me all morning.

11:02.395 --> 11:03.562
Whoa.

11:03.563 --> 11:05.736
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

11:07.033 --> 11:10.059
You hear me now, don't you, fuck?

11:14.374 --> 11:16.911
I didn't mean to cut you, Lucy.

11:18.311 --> 11:20.112
Somebody get Lucy
a Band-Aid. He's...

11:20.113 --> 11:22.559
He's got a cut.

11:23.683 --> 11:25.446
I thought he was...

11:39.799 --> 11:41.900
I love this city...

11:41.901 --> 11:44.736
not the sights, the city.

11:44.737 --> 11:47.506
I love her last night, and
I loved her this morning,

11:47.507 --> 11:49.641
before she brushes her teeth

11:49.642 --> 11:52.941
or I know she snores.

11:55.248 --> 11:58.450
I'm used to the feel
of her beside me.

11:58.451 --> 12:01.853
I'm used to the feel
of her beside me.

12:01.854 --> 12:04.656
I've known her warmth
and her coolness.

12:04.657 --> 12:07.492
She's... forgiven me.

12:07.493 --> 12:09.394
I've forgiven her.

12:09.395 --> 12:10.796
I'm used...

12:10.797 --> 12:12.764
I'm used to the feel
of her beside me.

12:12.765 --> 12:15.245
I'm used to the feel
of her beside me.

12:16.402 --> 12:17.936
You're right.

12:17.937 --> 12:20.212
I think I fucked her
last night too.

12:20.840 --> 12:23.041
I hope she don't have
no type of herpes.

12:23.042 --> 12:25.408
I'm used to the feel
of her, you know?

12:30.750 --> 12:34.584
I've been writing the story
of this city for 20 years.

12:53.906 --> 12:56.041
What's up with the lights?

12:56.042 --> 12:57.876
Oh, talk to Arthur, Mick.

12:57.877 --> 13:00.323
I keep telling him
he's got to relax.

13:00.880 --> 13:02.381
- I'll do that.
- Do that.

13:02.382 --> 13:05.550
All we can do is have faith
in the electric company.

13:05.551 --> 13:07.252
- Am I right?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, right, yeah.

13:07.253 --> 13:09.721
Sophie says we ain't had
electric for two hours.

13:09.722 --> 13:11.256
It's out in the whole neighborhood.

13:11.257 --> 13:12.291
Yeah.

13:12.292 --> 13:13.892
What are we gonna do with
the load I just brought in?

13:13.893 --> 13:16.228
What the fuck do you think we're
trying to figure out here, Mick?

13:16.229 --> 13:18.630
It's gonna be back
right away. Just relax.

13:18.631 --> 13:19.665
Yeah.

13:19.666 --> 13:21.767
Listen, we got a little business
to talk about, all right?

13:21.768 --> 13:23.258
Right.

13:26.606 --> 13:28.440
I got a problem.

13:28.441 --> 13:29.508
Let me guess.

13:29.509 --> 13:31.510
You don't have my $700.

13:31.511 --> 13:34.844
I'm into Sal for 20 large.

13:35.548 --> 13:36.915
Jesus Christ.

13:36.916 --> 13:38.483
I got so much shit going down,

13:38.484 --> 13:40.118
I don't even know where
it's coming from.

13:40.119 --> 13:42.187
Forget it. I'm doing all right.

13:42.188 --> 13:44.089
When you get it,
you can give it to me.

13:44.090 --> 13:45.123
All right?

13:45.124 --> 13:47.069
Take some of the meat.

13:52.398 --> 13:53.732
Nothing I can do with that.

13:53.733 --> 13:55.767
It's not even cut.

13:55.768 --> 13:56.902
Fuck it.

13:56.903 --> 14:00.930
Let's get this shit in your truck.

14:03.776 --> 14:06.078
I can't use it like this.
There's nowhere to cut it up.

14:06.079 --> 14:09.081
Look, we'll get the electric
back on, you come back tomorrow,

14:09.082 --> 14:12.381
we'll get somebody to
cut it up for you.

14:16.589 --> 14:17.589
- Here you go.
- I got it.

14:17.590 --> 14:19.353
- You got it, Mick?
- All right.

14:20.493 --> 14:23.599
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

14:24.197 --> 14:25.931
Fuck it all.

14:25.932 --> 14:28.230
It all works out in the end.

14:52.692 --> 14:54.819
All right, what happened here?

15:02.135 --> 15:04.535
It was the lift.

15:06.739 --> 15:08.741
The shackle come loose.

15:09.609 --> 15:12.043
Usually it's tied down
when we're not using it.

15:12.044 --> 15:14.012
The...

15:14.013 --> 15:17.282
chain swung out, and the shackle...

15:17.283 --> 15:19.184
hit the boy right in
the back of the head.

15:19.185 --> 15:21.386
That's what happened.

15:21.387 --> 15:23.155
I seen the whole thing.

15:23.156 --> 15:25.215
Kid never knew what hit him.

15:26.626 --> 15:28.360
Anyone else?

15:28.361 --> 15:30.602
I seen it too.

15:32.064 --> 15:33.465
What was his job?

15:33.466 --> 15:35.195
He was a day laborer.

15:38.004 --> 15:39.805
That it?

15:39.806 --> 15:42.138
That's what happened.

15:59.959 --> 16:01.722
Jeanie?

16:16.509 --> 16:18.352
Jeanie.

16:21.981 --> 16:24.586
Leon's dead.

16:38.531 --> 16:40.198
Richard.

16:40.199 --> 16:41.800
You feeling all right?

16:41.801 --> 16:44.069
Yeah, I had the flu.

16:44.070 --> 16:46.705
Didn't see your column
on page two yesterday.

16:46.706 --> 16:49.708
Opened the paper to see a
goddamn picture of some girl

16:49.709 --> 16:52.974
that had her teeth wired
together to lose weight.

16:53.980 --> 16:56.581
Readers count on you, Richard.

16:56.582 --> 16:59.251
Feeling much better today, okay.

16:59.252 --> 17:01.186
So I looked over the last year.

17:01.187 --> 17:04.489
Did you know you missed 42
days, not counting vacations?

17:04.490 --> 17:05.757
Really?

17:05.758 --> 17:06.858
Mm-hmm.

17:06.858 --> 17:10.127
And I got to thinking about it.

17:10.128 --> 17:13.798
Maybe we ought to bring in
another columnist, you know,

17:13.799 --> 17:15.599
someone to lighten the load.

17:15.601 --> 17:16.902
Found one yet?

17:16.903 --> 17:19.404
Thought I'd give you a
chance to think it over.

17:19.405 --> 17:21.740
Whatever you want, Brookie.

17:21.741 --> 17:23.974
But of course, if it's
a drinking problem...

17:23.976 --> 17:25.277
No.

17:25.278 --> 17:28.146
'Cause we have sent people
up to Horizons to dry out.

17:28.146 --> 17:29.614
We could do it for you too.

17:29.615 --> 17:30.815
No.

17:30.816 --> 17:33.307
It's a bug I caught.

17:36.622 --> 17:39.102
Here's my anniversary column.

17:48.401 --> 17:49.891
Yeah.

18:11.390 --> 18:13.191
You have to eat something.

18:13.192 --> 18:15.888
She probably already ate lunch.

18:16.495 --> 18:19.760
He was just a baby.

18:24.103 --> 18:26.037
- Hello.
- Mick, it's Bird.

18:26.038 --> 18:27.939
Hi. You get your electricity back?

18:27.940 --> 18:29.941
Yeah, it came on right
after you left.

18:29.942 --> 18:31.776
This isn't a great time.

18:31.777 --> 18:33.111
Why, what's the matter?

18:33.112 --> 18:34.946
We had an accident with Leon.

18:34.947 --> 18:37.415
What, he got his dick caught
in somebody's cash register?

18:37.416 --> 18:39.484
No, it's a real thing.
Something happened at work.

18:39.485 --> 18:41.086
Some kind of accident. He's dead.

18:41.087 --> 18:42.320
What?

18:42.321 --> 18:43.555
What is it?

18:43.556 --> 18:45.590
Well, they say
something fell on him.

18:45.591 --> 18:47.225
Fell on him? No shit.

18:47.226 --> 18:48.526
Yeah.

18:48.527 --> 18:49.628
Jesus.

18:49.629 --> 18:51.496
I'm sorry to hear that.

18:51.497 --> 18:52.530
Yeah.

18:52.531 --> 18:54.165
Anyway, what I was calling about...

18:54.166 --> 18:57.268
I don't know if it's the appropriate
time, but it's that horse,

18:57.269 --> 18:59.004
the one you was talking
about, Turning Leaf?

18:59.005 --> 19:02.707
She's running in a $15,000
claimer tomorrow at Keystone.

19:02.708 --> 19:04.809
I'm scaring up everything I can.

19:04.810 --> 19:07.779
{figured you'd want to do the same.

19:07.780 --> 19:09.280
- Okay, thanks.
- Okay.

19:09.281 --> 19:11.349
I'll let Jeanie know.

19:11.350 --> 19:14.085
Uh, just a friend,
heard about the accident.

19:14.086 --> 19:17.829
Uh, I got to take care
of the arrangements.

19:20.893 --> 19:25.130
<i>I think I've been there</i>

19:25.131 --> 19:30.569
<i>I think I know just what
you're going through</i>

19:36.342 --> 19:40.369
<i>A fallen angel is what you are</i>

19:41.781 --> 19:43.682
You're Richard Shellburn.

19:43.683 --> 19:45.810
Yes, I am.

19:47.353 --> 19:48.753
I thought you'd look older.

19:48.754 --> 19:51.450
Thought you would too.

19:54.760 --> 19:56.933
You go to Temple University?

19:58.097 --> 19:59.431
No.

19:59.432 --> 20:01.299
I graduated.

20:01.300 --> 20:02.333
Journalism.

20:02.334 --> 20:04.235
Oh.

20:04.236 --> 20:05.403
Yeah.

20:05.404 --> 20:07.238
Now I freelance, mostly sports.

20:07.239 --> 20:10.709
Who's Yama Bahama?

20:10.710 --> 20:13.712
<i>A fallen angel is what you are</i>

20:13.713 --> 20:15.988
Is that a name for your penis?

20:17.183 --> 20:18.383
Jesus.

20:18.384 --> 20:20.716
Everyone's got a name
for their penis.

20:27.593 --> 20:29.288
Mickey.

20:32.098 --> 20:34.032
We're real sorry, Mick.

20:34.033 --> 20:35.834
Leon was a good boy.

20:35.835 --> 20:38.136
It don't make no sense to me.

20:38.137 --> 20:40.605
I mean, somebody ought
to do something.

20:40.606 --> 20:43.905
The youth is our
hope for the future.

20:49.248 --> 20:51.449
What happened?

20:51.450 --> 20:53.551
I don't know.

20:53.552 --> 20:56.254
They say something
dropped on him...

20:56.255 --> 20:57.822
down at the job.

20:57.823 --> 20:59.390
Jesus.

20:59.391 --> 21:00.925
That's a shame.

21:00.926 --> 21:04.229
Got to go see Smilin' Jack,
make arrangements.

21:04.230 --> 21:06.266
Jeanie's messed up.

21:07.333 --> 21:11.136
Well, Saturday's a good day
for a funeral, always.

21:11.137 --> 21:13.404
Nobody has to get up the next day.

21:13.405 --> 21:14.572
Mm.

21:14.573 --> 21:17.408
We're collecting for the funeral.

21:17.409 --> 21:20.979
Fuckin' Leon's gonna cost
me more dead than alive.

21:20.980 --> 21:23.882
He was always a nice youngster.

21:23.883 --> 21:25.517
Tell Jeanie that for me.

21:25.518 --> 21:26.718
For Christ's sakes, Eleanor.

21:26.719 --> 21:28.086
You didn't even know him.

21:28.087 --> 21:29.821
That's a damnable lie!

21:29.822 --> 21:32.524
I know all our youngsters!

21:32.525 --> 21:34.492
He was nice back then, Mickey.

21:34.493 --> 21:36.895
He never broke into nobody's
house in the neighborhood...

21:36.896 --> 21:38.463
Eleanor!

21:38.464 --> 21:41.733
Are you gonna sit down,
or I got to pour out your drink?

21:41.734 --> 21:42.901
I mean it today.

21:42.902 --> 21:44.135
I'm cutting you off!

21:44.136 --> 21:47.674
Yeah, well, you can't
cut off the truth!

21:50.276 --> 21:52.881
Fuckin' neighborhood.

22:02.221 --> 22:03.254
Jack.

22:03.255 --> 22:04.745
Mickey.

22:08.194 --> 22:10.195
I'm so sorry to hear about Leon.

22:10.196 --> 22:11.362
Yeah.

22:11.363 --> 22:13.498
You know, sometimes you
wonder about God's plan.

22:13.499 --> 22:15.133
I just want to make
Jeanie feel better.

22:15.134 --> 22:17.045
Let me show you what we got, Mick.

22:33.619 --> 22:35.496
This is our best seller...

22:36.522 --> 22:39.424
mahogany veneer,
champagne interior.

22:39.425 --> 22:42.026
What about that one?

22:42.027 --> 22:44.429
Well, of course, you
know Jeanie best,

22:44.430 --> 22:46.967
but she ain't gonna want
some piece of junk.

22:49.368 --> 22:50.802
I got to think it over.

22:50.803 --> 22:52.136
Mick...

22:52.137 --> 22:54.472
we'll work something out.

22:54.473 --> 22:57.709
I just don't want to give her
anything that she ain't gonna like.

22:57.710 --> 23:00.712
Well, how about I stop
over tomorrow morning?

23:00.713 --> 23:04.282
It might be easier for her to talk
about it in familiar surroundings.

23:04.283 --> 23:06.558
I guess so.

23:13.592 --> 23:14.926
Yo, Mick.

23:14.927 --> 23:17.629
Was the body messed up?

23:17.630 --> 23:18.963
No, his body's fine.

23:18.964 --> 23:21.566
It's just the back of his head.

23:21.567 --> 23:23.334
That's no problem at all.

23:23.335 --> 23:26.236
The back of the head
takes care of itself.

23:38.617 --> 23:40.251
Leon didn't take no shit.

23:40.252 --> 23:44.564
If I was a father, that's what
I'd want my kid to be like.

23:48.260 --> 23:51.229
You know what I did the
day my mother died?

23:51.230 --> 23:54.565
I went out and I banged
a Locust Street whore.

23:54.566 --> 23:55.934
Remember those girls?

23:55.935 --> 23:57.101
No.

23:57.102 --> 23:58.403
I got home at 1:00 in the morning.

23:58.404 --> 24:00.772
My whole family was
waiting up for me.

24:00.773 --> 24:03.441
It was the Christians and
the lions all over again.

24:03.442 --> 24:05.569
On the day your mother died?

24:06.145 --> 24:09.649
I felt bad, but I had
to do something.

24:12.184 --> 24:14.452
What the fuck you doing, man?

24:14.453 --> 24:16.454
Fuck you.

24:16.455 --> 24:18.089
Fuck him!

24:18.090 --> 24:19.924
Hey, what the fuck is
wrong with you guys?

24:19.925 --> 24:21.626
- You're always doing that!
- Play the game.

24:21.627 --> 24:23.061
- Get out of here!
- Sit down!

24:23.062 --> 24:24.829
- Got a problem?
- Get the hell out of here!

24:24.830 --> 24:25.997
Fuck him!

24:25.998 --> 24:27.999
I got to get the fuck out of here.

24:28.000 --> 24:30.059
Your fucking shoe.

24:36.642 --> 24:38.609
You had a lot of
those screwdrivers.

24:38.610 --> 24:40.783
18.

24:42.581 --> 24:44.682
But you drank one.

24:44.683 --> 24:47.288
That's why I can't get it up.

24:48.654 --> 24:51.522
Could you always write?

24:51.523 --> 24:54.225
I mean, did you always
want to be a writer?

24:54.226 --> 24:55.560
What?

24:55.561 --> 24:59.292
Do you think sometime I could watch
you write one of your columns?

24:59.999 --> 25:02.172
Sometime.

25:34.166 --> 25:35.861
Oh.

25:52.518 --> 25:55.294
It is the damndest thing.

25:56.021 --> 25:58.865
I can't remember which
one of you is which.

26:00.759 --> 26:02.226
What time is it?

26:02.227 --> 26:05.071
Closing time.

26:08.067 --> 26:09.233
You been drinking?

26:09.234 --> 26:10.401
Yeah.

26:10.402 --> 26:12.737
Tonight you've been out drinking?

26:12.738 --> 26:15.173
And don't go in Jeanie's room.

26:15.174 --> 26:17.442
The doctor had to come twice
to give her medicine,

26:17.443 --> 26:19.477
and he said that she needs
a good night's sleep.

26:19.478 --> 26:21.512
I thought maybe she
might want someone...

26:21.513 --> 26:23.458
Joyce is in there with her.

26:26.485 --> 26:28.487
So you're Joanie.

27:03.288 --> 27:05.022
Aah! Oh, Jesus.

27:05.023 --> 27:06.820
- Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
- What?

27:08.293 --> 27:09.961
Oh, my God.

27:09.962 --> 27:11.462
It's all right. It's all right.

27:11.463 --> 27:12.763
I thought I saw Leon!

27:12.764 --> 27:14.932
Oh, my God!

27:14.933 --> 27:16.969
It's all right.

27:21.773 --> 27:25.042
Now, last but perhaps not least,

27:25.043 --> 27:27.478
I feel obliged to show you
the blue-gauge steel.

27:27.479 --> 27:32.348
In my opinion, uh, I think...

27:33.819 --> 27:36.310
I think she likes the mahogany.

27:38.757 --> 27:44.168
Now, do you have a particular
suit in mind for the service?

27:48.867 --> 27:51.165
Come upstairs.

27:55.908 --> 27:57.705
Voilà.

27:59.311 --> 28:01.212
Jesus Christ.

28:01.213 --> 28:03.420
It's a fucking men's shop.

28:06.251 --> 28:09.620
You know, I never owned
anything you couldn't put

28:09.621 --> 28:12.790
in a fucking drawer
till I met Jeanie.

28:12.791 --> 28:15.693
You suppose all this shit is hot?

28:15.694 --> 28:18.538
You learn in my business
not to question.

28:20.599 --> 28:24.835
So the 6 grand, can I put
it on layaway or what?

28:24.836 --> 28:28.306
You want me to tell Jeanie
you want something cheaper?

28:28.307 --> 28:29.340
Hey, I'm just...

28:29.341 --> 28:31.548
This should be all I need.

28:36.048 --> 28:38.382
Something happened to
Leon over at that job,

28:38.383 --> 28:41.489
something nobody's told us yet.

28:42.921 --> 28:45.623
Anybody tell you anything
you didn't tell me?

28:45.624 --> 28:50.828
All they told me was that something
dropped and hit him on the skull.

28:50.829 --> 28:52.830
That's the whole thing.

28:52.831 --> 28:55.333
Something else happened.

28:55.334 --> 28:57.177
It did.

28:58.003 --> 28:59.846
Okay.

29:01.506 --> 29:03.874
I'll see what I can find out.

29:03.875 --> 29:05.638
Okay?

29:08.914 --> 29:10.552
Hey, Mick.

29:11.583 --> 29:12.583
The power's back on.

29:12.584 --> 29:14.151
Let's get that meat cut for you.

29:14.152 --> 29:15.319
Listen, Bird...

29:15.320 --> 29:17.221
I appreciate you taking
it instead of the cash.

29:17.222 --> 29:18.856
We'll get all this shit
straightened out.

29:18.857 --> 29:19.890
Don't you worry.

29:19.891 --> 29:21.692
Hey.

29:21.693 --> 29:24.571
Look it, queers, huh?

29:25.130 --> 29:26.931
Remember in school when
they said you was queer

29:26.932 --> 29:28.399
if you wore yellow on Tuesday?

29:28.400 --> 29:31.096
That's the stupidest fucking
thing I heard all day.

29:32.137 --> 29:33.671
I forgot you ain't from here.

29:33.672 --> 29:35.573
You missed a lot of
great shit, Mick.

29:35.574 --> 29:37.475
Hey, Tony! Come here.

29:37.476 --> 29:38.976
This is my nephew.

29:38.977 --> 29:41.078
Say hello to Bird's main man.

29:41.079 --> 29:43.147
Hmm? He don't talk much.

29:43.148 --> 29:45.449
But this little fucker
can cut meat.

29:45.450 --> 29:48.019
Take the meat out of Mickey's truck
and cut it up for him, all right?

29:48.020 --> 29:50.716
Do a nice job. Don't
sneeze on it or nothing.

29:51.890 --> 29:53.991
Listen, Mick. I made up my mind.

29:53.992 --> 29:56.688
That horse, Turning Leaf?

29:57.362 --> 29:58.796
She's gonna come in tomorrow.

29:58.797 --> 29:59.997
Nice horse.

29:59.998 --> 30:01.332
She's running with a
bunch of shit too.

30:01.333 --> 30:02.733
She's a lock.

30:02.734 --> 30:05.703
Bird, there's nothing weighs half a ton
with little bitty ankles that's a lock.

30:05.704 --> 30:07.071
Hey, I'm trying to
help you out here,

30:07.072 --> 30:08.539
but if you don't want
to listen, it's on you.

30:08.540 --> 30:10.541
You want to help me?
I need that $700.

30:10.542 --> 30:12.043
Hey, all I got is this horse.

30:12.044 --> 30:14.478
Smilin' Jack ain't exactly
giving away funerals.

30:14.479 --> 30:15.813
Jesus, the funeral.

30:15.814 --> 30:18.149
I-I forgot.

30:18.150 --> 30:19.583
How's Jeanie doing?

30:19.584 --> 30:23.754
She's got some idea that something
else happened down there to Leon.

30:23.755 --> 30:27.558
I don't know where the fuck
it came from, but there it is.

30:27.559 --> 30:29.393
Yeah, fucking Leon.

30:29.394 --> 30:30.428
Yeah.

30:30.429 --> 30:34.198
Actually, I was hoping you...
you'd ask around for me.

30:34.199 --> 30:35.232
Yeah.

30:35.233 --> 30:37.360
You mean you want
me to talk to Sal?

30:38.870 --> 30:44.308
I-I hate to ask, but Jeanie
ain't gonna let go on this one.

30:46.578 --> 30:48.145
I'll do it for you.

30:48.146 --> 30:49.146
You got my word.

30:49.147 --> 30:50.481
- All right.
- Oh.

30:50.482 --> 30:52.983
- What the fuck?
- Come on.

30:52.984 --> 30:55.219
We ought to sue these
motherfuckers.

30:55.220 --> 30:57.888
"A 22-year-old construction
worker was killed yesterday

30:57.889 --> 30:59.623
when he slipped and
fell to his death."

30:59.624 --> 31:01.125
Leon Hubbard didn't
slip on nothing.

31:01.126 --> 31:03.527
They're laying block down there.
Where was there to fall?

31:03.528 --> 31:05.796
Jeez, you look worse than I do.

31:05.797 --> 31:07.431
Everybody in the fucking
city's gonna think

31:07.432 --> 31:08.799
we're a bunch of
jerk-offs down here,

31:08.800 --> 31:11.530
walking around falling
off shit all the time.

31:12.371 --> 31:14.805
I'm gonna call these motherfuckers.

31:14.806 --> 31:16.073
And they fucked up his age.

31:16.074 --> 31:18.406
He was a year ahead
of me in school.

31:20.879 --> 31:24.986
1,440 bucks.

31:27.252 --> 31:28.890
Yeah?

31:40.565 --> 31:43.193
Let me have the bag back sometime.

31:44.736 --> 31:47.037
Yeah.

31:47.038 --> 31:48.710
Thank you.

31:49.841 --> 31:50.875
Cheers.

31:50.876 --> 31:52.076
Cheers.

31:52.077 --> 31:53.567
Thank you.

32:06.091 --> 32:07.258
Richard.

32:07.259 --> 32:08.759
Huh?

32:08.760 --> 32:11.629
Brookie here. You feeling better?

32:11.630 --> 32:13.664
Well...

32:13.665 --> 32:16.767
I'm lying here with a...

32:16.768 --> 32:19.203
jaybird-naked-ass girl graduate

32:19.204 --> 32:22.106
of the Temple University
School of Journalism.

32:22.107 --> 32:24.008
I'm glad to hear it. How was she?

32:24.009 --> 32:27.211
Well, if you get off the phone,
I'll try and find out for you.

32:27.212 --> 32:30.414
Did you notice that you weren't
in the paper again this morning?

32:30.415 --> 32:31.615
Why?

32:31.616 --> 32:34.051
I gave you my anniversary
column yesterday.

32:34.052 --> 32:37.521
And I enjoyed it, just like I did
last year and the year before that.

32:37.522 --> 32:40.491
You've written the same anniversary
column four different times.

32:40.492 --> 32:43.294
I could write the same column
every day and get away with it.

32:43.295 --> 32:45.963
I need a favor.

32:45.964 --> 32:49.633
We ran a story about a kid got
killed on a construction job,

32:49.634 --> 32:51.302
and somehow we fucked it all up.

32:51.303 --> 32:52.903
Is this really important, Brookie?

32:52.904 --> 32:54.939
I mean, she got my
dick in her mouth.

32:54.940 --> 32:56.640
So I'm thinking, "Why don't I ask

32:56.641 --> 32:58.242
"Richard Shellburn to go down there

32:58.243 --> 33:00.911
"and write me a column about
that boy and get it done right?"

33:00.912 --> 33:04.081
- Bibles, pictures...
- I really... I can't talk now.

33:04.082 --> 33:06.417
I'm eating pussy.

33:06.418 --> 33:10.559
1821 25th street, God's Pocket.

33:16.661 --> 33:18.596
Thank you for listening.

33:18.597 --> 33:20.164
I'll get you some more coffee.

33:20.165 --> 33:21.962
It's my pleasure.

33:30.175 --> 33:32.473
This is my husband.

33:35.947 --> 33:38.582
We'll be in touch.

33:38.583 --> 33:40.417
Sorry for your loss.

33:40.418 --> 33:42.653
We're still investigating
the accident.

33:42.654 --> 33:44.488
We'll get back to you
when we're finished.

33:44.489 --> 33:46.582
Thank you, Officer.

33:56.501 --> 33:58.469
So what did they say?

33:58.470 --> 33:59.770
They were nice.

33:59.771 --> 34:02.399
They said they'd go back to
the yard and talk to the men.

34:06.444 --> 34:08.379
Something happened.

34:08.380 --> 34:10.473
How do you know that, Jeanie?

34:11.550 --> 34:13.723
I don't know, but I know.

34:25.230 --> 34:27.063
Sal. How you doing?

34:27.065 --> 34:28.532
You got my money?

34:28.533 --> 34:30.167
Hey, the electric went out.

34:30.168 --> 34:33.003
As soon as I get the meat cut,
get it out, everybody gets paid.

34:33.004 --> 34:36.273
All right, don't
fuck around, Arthur.

34:36.274 --> 34:37.775
Sal.

34:37.775 --> 34:40.277
Hey, I got a...

34:40.277 --> 34:42.724
a favor to ask.

34:46.016 --> 34:49.152
This kid got killed at
the block yard downtown.

34:49.154 --> 34:50.955
His mother's going crazy.

34:50.956 --> 34:52.989
They ain't telling
her what happened.

34:52.991 --> 34:55.525
What's this to me?

34:55.527 --> 34:57.294
The mother's married to a
guy who works for me...

34:57.295 --> 34:58.696
Mickey, the guy who took the truck?

34:58.697 --> 34:59.763
Yeah.

34:59.764 --> 35:01.966
Maybe you could send a
couple of guys down there,

35:01.967 --> 35:04.501
bounce somebody around
so they talk to you.

35:04.502 --> 35:06.070
Nothing's gonna happen down there?

35:06.071 --> 35:07.338
Nah.

35:07.339 --> 35:08.739
Just a couple guys to push around?

35:08.740 --> 35:10.310
That's it.

35:11.776 --> 35:12.910
All right.

35:12.911 --> 35:14.712
For a point on top of
what you already owe.

35:14.713 --> 35:16.747
Fine.

35:16.748 --> 35:18.591
Whatever you want.

35:20.151 --> 35:21.518
And, Arthur, don't fuck around.

35:21.519 --> 35:22.720
Okay.

35:22.721 --> 35:25.489
Hey. Make sure you get my money.

35:25.490 --> 35:27.958
You'll get it. You'll get it.

35:27.959 --> 35:29.802
You'll get it.

35:33.665 --> 35:36.133
It was an accident.

35:36.134 --> 35:37.935
That's...

35:37.936 --> 35:39.837
all there is to it.

35:39.838 --> 35:44.108
Kid was the wrong person
at the wrong place.

35:44.109 --> 35:47.738
Cops get the... n-nigger?

35:48.480 --> 35:50.147
You ain't grown enough

35:50.148 --> 35:53.447
to call that old man a nigger.

35:57.956 --> 36:01.158
Old Lucy will be back
when he's ready.

36:01.159 --> 36:03.252
All right, let's go.

36:53.311 --> 36:54.915
I'll have a beer.

37:16.568 --> 37:18.866
<i>She don't even care about me</i>

37:19.504 --> 37:22.172
Is that Leon Hubbard's
house across the street?

37:22.173 --> 37:24.575
You're aren't Richard
Shellburn, are you?

37:24.576 --> 37:26.343
Mm-hmm.

37:26.344 --> 37:29.179
I-I read you every day.

37:29.180 --> 37:32.916
Yeah, you're different from your
picture, but I knew it was you.

37:32.917 --> 37:34.918
It's me.

37:34.919 --> 37:36.720
So is that the Hubbard place?

37:36.721 --> 37:39.189
- Scarpato.
- Oh.

37:39.190 --> 37:41.191
The mother remarried.
Jeanie Scarpato.

37:41.192 --> 37:44.027
How's she taking it?

37:44.028 --> 37:46.897
Well, it was her only child.

37:46.898 --> 37:50.834
Mr. Shellburn, you're the only
one that knows what it's like

37:50.835 --> 37:52.536
down here in the Pocket.

37:52.537 --> 37:55.529
God bless you.

38:03.948 --> 38:05.115
Another?

38:05.116 --> 38:06.183
Thank you.

38:06.184 --> 38:07.351
It's the mother.

38:07.352 --> 38:09.620
The mother thinks
something happened.

38:09.621 --> 38:12.112
What does she think?

38:15.860 --> 38:18.896
You missing somebody today
besides Leon Hubbard?

38:18.897 --> 38:20.297
Seems like there was an old man.

38:20.298 --> 38:22.666
He was sitting against the wall.

38:22.667 --> 38:24.902
That's Old Lucy.

38:24.903 --> 38:27.237
Some days, he comes in,
and some days, he don't.

38:27.238 --> 38:29.439
He does as much work either way.

38:29.440 --> 38:31.567
He's about 100 years old.

38:33.745 --> 38:34.812
Look.

38:34.813 --> 38:37.147
That mother, she's got something.

38:37.148 --> 38:38.582
She could look at you a certain way

38:38.583 --> 38:40.717
and you'd stick a fork in your leg.

38:40.718 --> 38:44.087
They say that her
husband is connected.

38:44.088 --> 38:47.057
If that's true, that might be
where your problem comes from.

38:48.760 --> 38:50.761
Either way, she's got
his balls in a blender.

38:50.762 --> 38:52.229
You can see that.

38:53.097 --> 38:54.998
And there ain't no telling
what anybody will do

38:54.999 --> 38:56.166
with his balls in a blender.

38:56.167 --> 38:58.442
Fuckin' write it down or something.

39:13.685 --> 39:15.414
Hi.

39:16.221 --> 39:17.950
All right.

39:26.531 --> 39:28.365
Same race it was last night, Bird.

39:28.366 --> 39:31.602
I don't like this other
filly, the 6 horse.

39:31.603 --> 39:33.670
She scares me.

39:33.671 --> 39:35.439
She got a decent workout last week.

39:35.440 --> 39:36.506
So?

39:36.507 --> 39:39.276
- Put her at the bottom of an exacta.
- I don't like her.

39:39.277 --> 39:41.745
This horse can beat Turning
Leaf, the 6 horse.

39:41.746 --> 39:43.080
Your nerves are eating
your brain, Bird.

39:43.081 --> 39:45.782
- I am telling you, Mick...
- Bird, if Turning Leaf runs at all,

39:45.783 --> 39:49.779
there's nothing in that fucking dog
kennel that's gonna catch her.

39:51.689 --> 39:53.023
How much you got there?

39:53.024 --> 39:54.591
Whatever I could
get my hands on it.

39:54.592 --> 39:56.894
I borrowed some of
Sophie's flower money.

39:56.895 --> 39:58.228
Feel terrible.

39:58.229 --> 40:00.497
Turning Leaf, eight-to-one.

40:00.498 --> 40:03.000
You'll feel better once
you place your bet.

40:03.001 --> 40:04.668
I'm telling you, Mick.

40:04.669 --> 40:05.769
It's the 6 horse.

40:05.770 --> 40:08.739
Jesus, Bird.

40:08.740 --> 40:10.340
I'll be right back. Stay here.

40:10.341 --> 40:12.707
Don't do anything fucking crazy.

40:16.881 --> 40:21.351
Number 3 horse,
Turning Leaf, to win.

40:21.352 --> 40:23.411
45 times.

40:37.302 --> 40:38.906
Hey.

40:42.540 --> 40:44.576
You the boss?

40:46.244 --> 40:47.778
I'm the only one here.

40:47.779 --> 40:49.913
That's a fact.

40:49.914 --> 40:52.215
The thing is, somebody got
killed here yesterday,

40:52.216 --> 40:55.752
and there's some feeling it didn't
happen the way the cops said.

40:55.753 --> 40:59.356
So we were wondering if, uh, maybe
you were here when it happened.

40:59.357 --> 41:02.859
'Cause the guy who got it,
he was an important guy.

41:02.860 --> 41:04.657
Huh.

41:07.765 --> 41:10.256
He always said he was important.

41:11.636 --> 41:13.763
So how do you want to do this?

41:17.308 --> 41:20.077
It happened the way
I said to the police.

41:20.078 --> 41:23.914
And you Jew boys can do
it any damn way you want.

41:23.915 --> 41:25.615
It don't matter to me.

41:25.616 --> 41:26.984
"Jew boys."

41:26.985 --> 41:28.652
Now, why you want to do that?

41:28.653 --> 41:30.287
Did we insult you in any way?

41:30.288 --> 41:32.356
Huh?

41:32.357 --> 41:33.724
Come on.

41:33.725 --> 41:35.425
Let's go somewhere we can talk.

41:35.426 --> 41:36.927
Hit him, Ronnie.

41:36.928 --> 41:38.896
Fucking hit him!

41:52.210 --> 41:53.973
Oh, God!

41:59.150 --> 42:01.551
You didn't bet the
6 horse, did you?

42:01.552 --> 42:03.053
Well...

42:03.054 --> 42:06.194
You're fucking crazy.

42:07.392 --> 42:12.195
And they're off at Keystone,
$15,000 claiming race.

42:12.196 --> 42:15.565
The number 4 horse, One Hit
Wonder, takes an early lead.

42:15.566 --> 42:17.667
My Oh Might tucked in at the rail

42:17.668 --> 42:20.570
and Shana Three coming
up between the horses.

42:20.571 --> 42:23.273
No Man's Land moves
up on the outside.

42:23.274 --> 42:26.476
One Hit Wonder, Shana
Three, No Man's Land.

42:26.477 --> 42:28.211
My Oh Might makes a
move on the inside.

42:28.212 --> 42:32.049
One Hit Wonder, Shana Three,
and into third, Turning Leaf.

42:32.050 --> 42:34.384
Turning Leaf stiff moving
up to the second spot.

42:34.385 --> 42:38.688
One Hit Wonder, Turning
Leaf, Shana Three.

42:38.689 --> 42:40.323
We're into the far turn,

42:40.324 --> 42:43.026
and it's One Hit Wonder
showing the lead by a length

42:43.027 --> 42:44.194
with Turning Leaf...

42:44.195 --> 42:45.362
Come on, you motherfucker.

42:45.363 --> 42:48.098
One Hit Wonder, Turning Leaf.

42:48.099 --> 42:49.866
And it's Turning Leaf pulling in.

42:49.867 --> 42:51.668
- Come on!
- Yes!

42:51.669 --> 42:55.338
And at the top of the lane, it's
Turning Leaf moving into first.

42:55.339 --> 42:57.974
Turning Leaf-One, Hit Wonder
holding on to second.

42:57.975 --> 43:00.143
Please.

43:00.144 --> 43:03.013
And passing the number 5 horse
is Holmesdale, the number 6.

43:03.014 --> 43:06.416
Turning Leaf, One Hit
Wonder, and Holmesdale

43:06.417 --> 43:08.510
racing up on the outside.

43:10.421 --> 43:13.023
Turning Leaf,
Holmesdale on the outside.

43:13.024 --> 43:14.257
It's the 6.

43:14.258 --> 43:15.659
Turning Leaf, Holmesdale...

43:15.660 --> 43:17.894
they fight it out,
and it's Holmesdale.

43:17.895 --> 43:20.386
- Ohh!
- No.

43:26.671 --> 43:29.206
I-I tried to tell you, Mick.

43:29.207 --> 43:31.050
It was the 6.

43:32.610 --> 43:34.339
Mm.

43:58.069 --> 44:00.310
Hello?

44:06.377 --> 44:08.220
Can I help you?

44:11.215 --> 44:15.252
Uh, I'm looking for Mrs. Scarpato.

44:15.253 --> 44:17.154
Yes.

44:17.155 --> 44:19.723
You're Mrs. Scarpato?

44:19.724 --> 44:21.291
Yes.

44:21.292 --> 44:22.592
I'm sorry.

44:22.593 --> 44:23.927
I'm sorry.

44:23.928 --> 44:25.762
I'm sorry.

44:25.763 --> 44:27.831
Uh...

44:27.832 --> 44:30.867
I'm Richard Shellburn
of The Daily Times.

44:30.868 --> 44:32.035
Oh, my.

44:32.036 --> 44:34.527
Uh, please come in.

44:40.244 --> 44:43.418
This one makes his ears
look bigger than they were.

44:47.285 --> 44:49.082
Oh.

44:51.289 --> 44:53.587
I'm so sorry for your loss.

44:54.392 --> 44:56.693
It didn't happen like
they said it happened.

44:56.694 --> 44:59.095
There's something wrong with it.

44:59.096 --> 45:02.907
I knew Leon, and he was my boy.

45:10.308 --> 45:12.219
I know.

45:24.455 --> 45:27.356
Mr. Shellburn?

45:41.172 --> 45:44.881
So, um, what...
what kind of boy was he?

45:48.346 --> 45:50.647
Hey.

45:50.648 --> 45:53.883
What was that job, uh,
yesterday... 700?

45:53.884 --> 45:55.819
It's old business. I took the meat.

45:55.820 --> 45:56.886
Fuck that.

45:56.887 --> 45:57.988
Here.

45:57.989 --> 45:59.656
I took the meat. Keep your money.

45:59.657 --> 46:00.824
Take 7.

46:00.825 --> 46:02.659
- Take 10, for the interest.
- Bird.

46:02.660 --> 46:04.327
Look, I got maybe 12 grand here.

46:04.328 --> 46:05.862
I owe Sal 20.

46:05.863 --> 46:09.162
But if I give him 10, maybe
he'll lay off for a while.

46:12.436 --> 46:14.938
7?

46:14.939 --> 46:16.509
All right.

46:19.977 --> 46:22.912
Thinking of taking
Sophie to Florida.

46:22.913 --> 46:24.914
She wants to live in one
of those trailer parks

46:24.915 --> 46:28.544
with her friends, grow
some shit in the yard.

46:35.559 --> 46:37.049
Jack.

46:37.628 --> 46:40.797
Jesus, God. You scared
the piss out of me.

46:40.798 --> 46:42.800
Oh, shit.

46:44.001 --> 46:46.879
You think people are gonna
smell this shit on her?

46:47.738 --> 46:50.373
Irish funeral.

46:50.374 --> 46:53.548
Listen, uh, I got a
problem with the money.

46:55.046 --> 46:56.646
Oh, that's too bad.

46:56.647 --> 46:59.983
Yeah, it's nothing permanent,
but if we have the service,

46:59.984 --> 47:01.718
I could pay you back
in a couple weeks,

47:01.719 --> 47:05.455
and if I can't get it back to
you then, I'll sell the truck.

47:05.456 --> 47:07.457
How much money you got?

47:07.458 --> 47:08.992
700.

47:08.993 --> 47:10.994
What about the fucking
money from The Hollywood?

47:10.995 --> 47:12.295
There was more than 700 there.

47:12.296 --> 47:14.297
Things happen.
I'll get you the money.

47:14.298 --> 47:16.633
I just... I-I got to
have the funeral,

47:16.634 --> 47:18.875
and Jeanie's fucked
up over all this.

47:19.437 --> 47:20.470
That's nothing to me.

47:20.471 --> 47:23.039
It's your fuckin' woman and your
fuckin' body unless I get paid.

47:23.040 --> 47:24.174
Don't get hysterical.

47:24.175 --> 47:25.642
I don't need my
business on the street.

47:25.643 --> 47:27.077
You ain't got no fucking business.

47:27.078 --> 47:29.779
What you got is
something on the side.

47:29.780 --> 47:30.880
No.

47:30.881 --> 47:32.515
No, you bet a game, right?

47:32.516 --> 47:34.084
You bet a fucking game.

47:34.085 --> 47:36.086
What I did has nothing
to do with you,

47:36.087 --> 47:37.587
and what you got to worry about

47:37.588 --> 47:40.156
is making sure that everything's
all right Saturday,

47:40.157 --> 47:43.093
and then you get your money.

47:43.094 --> 47:45.028
Sure, Mick.

47:45.029 --> 47:47.130
Sure.

47:47.131 --> 47:48.798
Yeah.

47:48.799 --> 47:50.467
Don't look at me like that, Jack.

47:50.468 --> 47:51.634
W-what?

47:51.635 --> 47:53.236
What are you talking about...
look at you?

47:53.237 --> 47:55.273
- Don't look at me like that.
- What?

47:56.974 --> 47:59.109
Oh.

47:59.110 --> 48:01.177
Motherfucker!

48:01.178 --> 48:03.908
No need to panic.

48:04.915 --> 48:08.218
I'll pay you back in a couple
weeks, a month on the outside.

48:08.219 --> 48:10.278
You understand?

48:11.188 --> 48:12.422
I'm sorry, Mick.

48:12.423 --> 48:14.459
I don't know what's wrong with me.

48:15.659 --> 48:18.196
Let me... let me go get us a beer.

48:27.972 --> 48:31.641
Leon always loved animals,
ever since he was a little boy.

48:31.642 --> 48:35.237
He always wanted a dog
or a cat or something.

48:36.080 --> 48:40.192
I used to think it would be nice to
live out in the country and have a few.

48:41.485 --> 48:43.976
Think that country air would...

48:49.427 --> 48:52.028
Mr. Shellburn?

48:52.029 --> 48:55.298
I have a place by the water.

48:55.299 --> 48:59.614
I've had it for a very long
time, and nobody knows.

49:15.853 --> 49:21.057
I go there sometimes at
night, I drink too much,

49:21.058 --> 49:23.026
and I wake up with the birds,

49:23.027 --> 49:26.053
and things are growing
everywhere you look.

49:48.986 --> 49:51.762
Do you need to know
anything else about Leon?

50:06.937 --> 50:08.805
Yo, Mick.

50:08.806 --> 50:10.874
I don't know what got
into me. I was wrong.

50:10.875 --> 50:12.809
I need this done right.

50:12.810 --> 50:14.244
We'll take care of it.

50:14.245 --> 50:16.736
You and me got no arguments, Mick.

50:18.249 --> 50:19.883
I hope you don't mind
going out the side.

50:19.884 --> 50:21.050
I'm locked up in front.

50:21.051 --> 50:22.541
I don't mind nothing.

50:27.558 --> 50:29.893
I got to get this light fixed.

50:29.894 --> 50:31.227
It's getting cold.

50:31.228 --> 50:33.071
Yeah, it's a cold world.

50:52.650 --> 50:54.709
What the fuck?

51:05.963 --> 51:08.534
Holy shit.

51:17.441 --> 51:19.932
Oh, Jesus, Leon.

52:23.407 --> 52:26.285
I need to know what
happened to my boy, please.

52:27.144 --> 52:29.479
Oh, um...

52:29.480 --> 52:31.114
can I call you tomorrow?

52:31.115 --> 52:33.783
Yes, please.

52:33.784 --> 52:35.118
Thank you, Mr. Shellburn.

52:35.119 --> 52:37.178
Okay.

52:38.889 --> 52:41.164
Jeanie?

52:45.029 --> 52:47.839
I'm up here with Richard Shellburn.

52:56.006 --> 52:58.497
He wanted to see Leon's room.

53:02.746 --> 53:04.747
Richard Shellburn,
this is my husband.

53:04.748 --> 53:08.161
Oh, um, yeah,
I'm sorry for your loss.

53:12.156 --> 53:15.692
Um, you know, I think that's, uh...

53:15.693 --> 53:19.162
I think it's all I need,
uh, for now.

53:19.163 --> 53:21.531
Anything, please. If you
need anything, call me.

53:21.532 --> 53:22.598
Okay.

53:22.599 --> 53:24.100
It's all I have to do.

53:24.101 --> 53:26.137
All right.

53:34.478 --> 53:37.504
Jeanie, there's something
I need to tell you.

53:42.219 --> 53:43.789
Jeanie.

53:54.531 --> 53:56.203
Jeanie.

54:48.452 --> 54:51.587
Everything set for tomorrow?

54:51.588 --> 54:53.920
All set.

54:54.658 --> 54:57.889
Just a few last-minute details.

55:05.602 --> 55:06.736
Where's Arthur?

55:06.737 --> 55:09.372
Who?

55:09.373 --> 55:10.573
Where is he?

55:10.574 --> 55:13.709
This is the way you do business...
scaring an old woman?

55:13.710 --> 55:16.512
Oh, now... now you're
gonna steal from me?

55:16.513 --> 55:17.613
He's in the back.

55:17.614 --> 55:18.714
Want me go around back?

55:18.715 --> 55:20.249
Yeah, he can't run,
but what the fuck?

55:20.250 --> 55:21.617
Well, he's... he's got the money.

55:21.618 --> 55:23.085
He told me.

55:23.086 --> 55:24.921
This ain't about the money.

55:24.922 --> 55:26.589
You see my cousin out there?

55:26.590 --> 55:28.424
Yesterday he had two eyes.

55:28.425 --> 55:31.427
Now he's gonna have a piece of glass in
his fucking head the rest of his life.

55:31.428 --> 55:33.162
Without Arthur, what's
gonna happen to me?

55:33.163 --> 55:36.269
If I were you, I'd shut my mouth.

55:39.636 --> 55:40.970
Run for your life, Arthur!

55:40.971 --> 55:43.773
What the fuck?

55:43.774 --> 55:46.470
Oh!

55:49.780 --> 55:50.813
Sophie!

55:50.814 --> 55:52.748
What are you doing, Sophie?

55:52.749 --> 55:54.546
One second.

55:57.521 --> 55:59.557
Oh.

56:00.591 --> 56:02.925
This is my family, you hear me?

56:02.926 --> 56:04.861
- You little fuck!
- No, no, no, no!

56:04.862 --> 56:06.295
I'll fucking kill you, you fuck!

56:06.296 --> 56:07.396
Arthur, Arthur, Arthur!

56:07.397 --> 56:09.131
- I'll kill you!
- Stop. Stop.

56:09.132 --> 56:10.800
- Arthur, you're getting...
- Yeah!

56:10.801 --> 56:13.336
You're getting blood all over
your pants. Just go change.

56:13.337 --> 56:15.504
- The cops will be here.
- I swear to Christ, Sophie,

56:15.505 --> 56:16.973
I didn't know nothing like
this was gonna happen.

56:16.974 --> 56:18.040
Go change your pants.

56:18.041 --> 56:22.778
You don't want people taking pictures
of you looking like this. Right?

56:22.779 --> 56:24.614
- Fuck.
- Arthur.

56:24.615 --> 56:25.982
That fuck.

56:25.983 --> 56:29.245
Arthur, this is not the time
to go wacko... not now.

56:49.473 --> 56:50.973
Yeah, Operator?

56:50.974 --> 56:56.011
I want to, uh, report that two
men tried to rob my flower shop.

57:05.956 --> 57:08.129
Mickey left early.

57:09.126 --> 57:11.663
He seemed different.

57:14.731 --> 57:16.565
Hello.

57:16.566 --> 57:18.295
This is Richard Shellburn.

57:19.736 --> 57:21.681
Richard Shellburn.

57:26.243 --> 57:27.510
Mr. Shellburn?

57:27.511 --> 57:30.613
Uh, we need to talk.

57:30.614 --> 57:32.748
Did you find something out?

57:32.749 --> 57:34.592
I'D' pick you up.

57:38.021 --> 57:39.522
Where are we going?

57:39.523 --> 57:42.024
We're almost there.

57:42.025 --> 57:43.902
Almost.

57:46.697 --> 57:49.732
It all looks the same, doesn't it?

57:49.733 --> 57:53.135
If you woke up here alone,
you'd never get back.

57:53.136 --> 57:55.627
Never want to.

58:27.671 --> 58:29.338
Hey, Nick.

58:29.339 --> 58:30.373
Got a minute?

58:30.374 --> 58:31.841
I'm here.

58:31.842 --> 58:33.009
I got some meat.

58:33.010 --> 58:34.377
Thought maybe you could use some.

58:34.378 --> 58:35.411
No.

58:35.412 --> 58:36.579
Well, how much you got?

58:36.580 --> 58:38.681
Four sides, Kansas choice beef.

58:38.682 --> 58:39.849
No.

58:39.850 --> 58:41.250
How much you want?

58:41.251 --> 58:43.486
$1,000. I don't got time
to fuck around with this.

58:43.487 --> 58:44.820
You got it with you?

58:44.821 --> 58:46.822
Yeah, let me take you
down a side to look at.

58:46.823 --> 58:48.859
I could look at it in the truck.

58:49.826 --> 58:51.494
I got some other shit in there.

58:51.495 --> 58:53.829
I don't care what you
got in your truck.

58:53.830 --> 58:56.165
I don't see nothing but meat
when I'm looking at meat.

58:56.166 --> 58:57.867
Let me pull you down a side.

58:57.868 --> 58:59.568
Eh, fuck it. I don't
think I want in on this.

58:59.569 --> 59:01.337
- All right, take a look.
- For Christ's sakes.

59:01.338 --> 59:02.705
- I don't see nothing...
- It's good beef.

59:02.706 --> 59:04.273
I don't see nothing but
what I'm looking at.

59:04.274 --> 59:06.117
Anything else is your own business.

59:08.712 --> 59:09.745
Oh.

59:09.746 --> 59:11.280
This looks good, man.

59:11.281 --> 59:13.215
- What are you doing?
- Let me take a look at it.

59:13.216 --> 59:14.854
You don't got to go up there.

59:23.794 --> 59:25.461
I'm just doing some guy
a favor, all right?

59:25.462 --> 59:27.828
Don't pay any attention
to that. It's nothing.

59:33.070 --> 59:34.570
It's cold.

59:34.571 --> 59:35.905
It's a refrigerated truck.

59:35.906 --> 59:37.106
What do you say, Nick?

59:37.107 --> 59:38.908
You gonna take it off
my hands or what?

59:38.909 --> 59:41.510
It's a cheap suit.
What happened to him?

59:41.511 --> 59:43.001
He died.

59:44.881 --> 59:46.682
I-I-I'm doing some guy a favor.

59:46.683 --> 59:48.584
I don't like this.

59:48.585 --> 59:50.486
You put me in a bad position.

59:50.487 --> 59:52.321
Because of you,
I'm an accessory now.

59:52.322 --> 59:54.390
You ain't nothing because
you ain't seen nothing.

59:54.391 --> 59:56.058
I ain't taking that kind of meat.

59:56.059 --> 59:57.960
Who knows what kind of
sickness it could have got

59:57.961 --> 59:59.395
riding back here with a human body?

59:59.396 --> 01:00:00.763
You're the one that wanted
to fucking look at it.

01:00:00.764 --> 01:00:02.098
I didn't want to see that.

01:00:02.099 --> 01:00:03.732
As a matter of fact,
I didn't see it.

01:00:03.733 --> 01:00:06.068
I don't know nothing about it,
and you didn't come by today.

01:00:06.069 --> 01:00:07.236
Take the fucking meat.

01:00:07.237 --> 01:00:09.728
I ain't... get the
fuck out of here.

01:00:21.818 --> 01:00:23.652
I thought when you told
me about this place,

01:00:23.653 --> 01:00:25.348
you might have made it up.

01:00:27.457 --> 01:00:30.392
I bought this for my wife
without telling her.

01:00:31.495 --> 01:00:35.124
That's before she realized
that she hated me.

01:00:36.766 --> 01:00:38.501
Okay.

01:00:38.502 --> 01:00:40.669
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

01:00:40.670 --> 01:00:43.572
All right.

01:00:43.573 --> 01:00:46.349
This is where the living
room was supposed to be.

01:00:48.778 --> 01:00:51.076
It's a good view.

01:01:46.703 --> 01:01:48.580
Shit.

01:02:18.068 --> 01:02:19.638
Ah.

01:02:26.209 --> 01:02:28.382
I'm 60 years old.

01:02:31.748 --> 01:02:33.916
You don't look that old.

01:02:33.917 --> 01:02:36.151
Well...

01:02:36.152 --> 01:02:39.747
I'm 60 years old, and a
whole city loves me.

01:02:40.991 --> 01:02:43.492
I get letters every
day from people...

01:02:43.493 --> 01:02:47.396
asking me to come to dinner,

01:02:47.397 --> 01:02:49.999
visit them in the Poconos.

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:52.662
Do you go?

01:02:53.903 --> 01:02:55.904
No.

01:02:55.905 --> 01:02:58.510
Golf... they want me to play golf.

01:03:04.881 --> 01:03:06.644
It's pretty.

01:03:08.118 --> 01:03:11.178
It's actually beautiful.

01:03:12.255 --> 01:03:14.256
Tell me,

01:03:14.257 --> 01:03:17.059
how long would it take you

01:03:17.060 --> 01:03:21.224
to get tired of having
a celebrity around?

01:03:23.933 --> 01:03:25.400
Mickey!

01:03:26.136 --> 01:03:28.304
What, you come here to finally
sell me that truck, huh?

01:03:28.305 --> 01:03:30.572
Yeah, yeah. I need
to get rid of it.

01:03:30.573 --> 01:03:31.874
Oh.

01:03:31.875 --> 01:03:33.309
What's... what's wrong with it?

01:03:33.310 --> 01:03:34.643
Ah, nothing.

01:03:34.644 --> 01:03:37.079
Temporary financial problem.

01:03:37.080 --> 01:03:38.380
Okay, well, what did you...

01:03:38.381 --> 01:03:40.258
what did you pay for that thing?

01:03:46.756 --> 01:03:49.236
Oh, my God, Mickey, they
saw you coming, huh?

01:03:50.660 --> 01:03:52.828
And there's nothing wrong with it?

01:03:52.829 --> 01:03:54.396
60,000 miles on it.

01:03:54.397 --> 01:03:57.266
I check the oil, keep
it in the garage.

01:03:57.267 --> 01:03:58.801
Now, you can start it up,

01:03:58.802 --> 01:04:03.005
but I don't want
nobody taking it out.

01:04:03.006 --> 01:04:05.107
I got some stuff in the back.

01:04:05.108 --> 01:04:07.142
I don't see nothing but what
I'm looking at, Mickey.

01:04:07.143 --> 01:04:08.444
You heard me.

01:04:08.445 --> 01:04:09.935
All right.

01:04:13.650 --> 01:04:15.527
Stretch! Stretch!

01:04:19.189 --> 01:04:22.324
It's hard to believe only two
days ago, Leon was alive.

01:04:22.325 --> 01:04:25.829
Nothing works against
you like time.

01:04:26.830 --> 01:04:28.627
Time's a bitch.

01:04:39.876 --> 01:04:42.367
Oh.

01:04:46.883 --> 01:04:49.852
So you said you found
something out about Leon?

01:04:56.493 --> 01:04:58.660
My husband's gonna
wonder where I am.

01:04:58.661 --> 01:05:00.496
Let me tell you about your husband.

01:05:00.497 --> 01:05:04.466
He can put an air conditioner
into a wall all by himself

01:05:04.467 --> 01:05:06.435
or lift an engine block,

01:05:06.436 --> 01:05:09.338
but he sits in that bar for
two hours every night,

01:05:09.339 --> 01:05:13.420
and then he comes home,
and he doesn't say jack shit.

01:05:18.448 --> 01:05:21.952
He doesn't have the faintest
idea what to do with you.

01:05:39.369 --> 01:05:40.536
How long you had that thing?

01:05:40.537 --> 01:05:42.937
About a year and a half.

01:05:44.240 --> 01:05:46.775
Well, you know, if everything
works out, Mickey,

01:05:46.776 --> 01:05:49.845
you know, I could probably
get you, like, 5 1/2, 6.

01:05:49.846 --> 01:05:51.046
Yeah.

01:05:51.047 --> 01:05:53.482
Yeah, because business sucks
in the summer, Mickey.

01:05:53.483 --> 01:05:55.517
Everyone's thinking about pussy.

01:05:55.518 --> 01:05:56.518
Hmm.

01:05:56.519 --> 01:05:57.953
What the fuck?

01:05:57.954 --> 01:06:00.122
He's just gonna make sure
that everything checks out.

01:06:00.123 --> 01:06:01.623
What the fuck?

01:06:01.624 --> 01:06:03.759
He'll be right back.
He's gonna be back in a sec...

01:06:03.760 --> 01:06:04.893
Mickey.

01:06:04.894 --> 01:06:08.564
Mickey, I can't buy no truck without
taking it out for a drive first.

01:06:08.565 --> 01:06:10.863
You know that.

01:06:12.035 --> 01:06:15.516
I really should be getting back.

01:06:39.429 --> 01:06:42.637
I'm not mad. I'm just running!

01:06:46.336 --> 01:06:48.827
Wait a minute!

01:06:50.273 --> 01:06:52.074
Stop!

01:06:52.075 --> 01:06:53.918
Stop!

01:07:47.030 --> 01:07:49.164
This is my motherfucking meat.

01:07:49.165 --> 01:07:51.895
Take it easy, lady.

01:08:02.478 --> 01:08:05.975
Where the fuck did he think he
was going in a suit like that?

01:08:31.774 --> 01:08:33.774
Anyone see the vehicle
hit the victim?

01:08:33.776 --> 01:08:35.778
Jesus Christ.

01:08:53.462 --> 01:08:55.636
I love you.

01:09:00.870 --> 01:09:06.279
The moment that I laid eyes on
you, I was in love with you.

01:09:17.553 --> 01:09:19.921
Where... where's your truck?

01:09:19.921 --> 01:09:21.823
It's wrecked.

01:09:21.823 --> 01:09:23.091
Stretch?

01:09:23.091 --> 01:09:25.457
I don't know... hospital, I guess.

01:09:26.429 --> 01:09:27.962
You got insurance, Mick?

01:09:27.964 --> 01:09:30.564
I told you you could start it
but not to take it anywhere.

01:09:30.566 --> 01:09:32.768
I got to try it before I buy it.

01:09:32.769 --> 01:09:34.301
You told me 6.

01:09:34.303 --> 01:09:35.837
Oh, Mickey, I...

01:09:35.837 --> 01:09:37.738
You know, I can't buy
something that's wrecked.

01:09:37.740 --> 01:09:39.006
I would love to help
you out, but I...

01:09:39.008 --> 01:09:40.885
You bought it already.

01:09:42.912 --> 01:09:45.608
You know, technically, Mick...

01:09:48.818 --> 01:09:53.694
That's for the mahogany box, the
funeral, and everything else, right?

01:09:54.924 --> 01:09:56.792
Where's the deceased?

01:09:56.793 --> 01:09:59.327
He's down at the morgue.
There was another accident.

01:09:59.328 --> 01:10:00.395
When it rains, it pours.

01:10:00.396 --> 01:10:03.098
Yeah, well, they got him down there.
They probably don't know who he is.

01:10:03.099 --> 01:10:06.435
- He wasn't carrying no identification.
- What the hell happened to you?

01:10:06.436 --> 01:10:10.205
Can we take care of this tomorrow?
I want it done tomorrow.

01:10:10.206 --> 01:10:12.868
Let me call down the
morgue and find out.

01:10:14.210 --> 01:10:16.872
You know, this never
come up before.

01:10:21.050 --> 01:10:23.018
Jeanie.

01:10:24.387 --> 01:10:26.059
Jeanie.

01:10:36.766 --> 01:10:37.899
Hello.

01:10:37.900 --> 01:10:39.034
Hey, Mick. It's Bird.

01:10:39.035 --> 01:10:40.702
Yeah.

01:10:40.703 --> 01:10:42.304
You heard, right?

01:10:42.305 --> 01:10:43.305
What?

01:10:43.306 --> 01:10:44.840
You should have seen it.

01:10:44.841 --> 01:10:47.609
I didn't even know Sophie kept
that fucking thing loaded.

01:10:47.610 --> 01:10:49.277
What, Sal?

01:10:49.278 --> 01:10:50.479
Yeah.

01:10:50.480 --> 01:10:54.316
Sophie and I are gonna
get out of here tonight.

01:10:54.317 --> 01:10:56.918
I'll let you know where we end up.

01:10:56.919 --> 01:10:58.648
Good luck, Mick.

01:11:12.168 --> 01:11:14.169
What the hell happened to you?

01:11:14.170 --> 01:11:16.805
The funeral's tomorrow at 3:00.

01:11:16.806 --> 01:11:18.940
If you wouldn't mind
letting people know?

01:11:18.941 --> 01:11:20.308
That's good.

01:11:20.309 --> 01:11:22.310
Saturday is a good
day for a funeral.

01:11:22.311 --> 01:11:24.802
Small service at Jack's.

01:11:34.490 --> 01:11:36.992
Shame about the kid.

01:11:36.993 --> 01:11:39.484
The whole neighborhood was sorry.

01:11:40.530 --> 01:11:42.063
But they didn't live with him.

01:11:42.064 --> 01:11:43.865
They don't know what
it's really like.

01:11:43.866 --> 01:11:45.200
That's the truth.

01:11:45.201 --> 01:11:47.536
And they didn't live with Jeanie.

01:11:47.537 --> 01:11:49.971
They can say this or that.

01:11:49.972 --> 01:11:52.099
It's all just talk.

01:11:53.442 --> 01:11:55.285
What is?

01:11:56.412 --> 01:11:58.580
Don't listen to them.

01:11:58.581 --> 01:12:02.392
Nobody in here went any
further than the 10th grade.

01:12:03.920 --> 01:12:05.587
What's just talk?

01:12:05.588 --> 01:12:08.723
She was just riding in his car.

01:12:08.724 --> 01:12:10.125
It doesn't mean anything.

01:12:10.126 --> 01:12:12.127
What the fuck are
you talking about?

01:12:12.128 --> 01:12:15.831
The big thing is, you can
leave all of this behind.

01:12:15.832 --> 01:12:17.766
That's the beauty part.

01:12:17.767 --> 01:12:19.234
Remember that.

01:12:19.235 --> 01:12:21.236
You want to know why I
never got out of here?

01:12:21.237 --> 01:12:24.536
What I want to know is
what everybody's saying.

01:12:30.580 --> 01:12:31.580
Ray.

01:12:31.581 --> 01:12:32.581
It's nothing.

01:12:32.582 --> 01:12:34.583
I'm telling you.

01:12:34.584 --> 01:12:36.529
Ray.

01:12:40.356 --> 01:12:43.200
That Jeanie's been fucking
Richard Shellburn.

01:12:45.661 --> 01:12:47.195
It's not what I think.

01:12:47.196 --> 01:12:49.364
It's what they're saying.

01:12:49.365 --> 01:12:51.867
<i>Come down off your throne</i>

01:12:51.868 --> 01:12:53.602
<i>And leave your body alone</i>

01:12:53.603 --> 01:12:55.570
She ain't fucking nobody.

01:12:55.571 --> 01:12:57.339
<i>Somebody</i>

01:12:57.340 --> 01:13:01.076
<i>Must change</i>

01:13:01.077 --> 01:13:02.577
She ain't.

01:13:02.578 --> 01:13:06.681
<i>I've been waiting so long</i>

01:13:06.682 --> 01:13:10.752
<i>Somebody holds the key</i>

01:13:10.753 --> 01:13:13.688
<i>Well, I'm near the end</i>

01:13:13.689 --> 01:13:16.992
<i>And I just ain't got the time</i>

01:13:16.993 --> 01:13:19.027
She's got... she's got some idea

01:13:19.028 --> 01:13:22.530
that Leon died differently
than the cops said, is all.

01:13:22.531 --> 01:13:23.632
He's helping her.

01:13:23.633 --> 01:13:25.133
What the fuck you
starting now, Ray?

01:13:25.134 --> 01:13:26.201
We're just talking.

01:13:26.202 --> 01:13:29.004
Fuckin' funeral's tomorrow, and
you're talking shit like that?

01:13:29.005 --> 01:13:31.306
I didn't say anything everybody
else in here didn't say first.

01:13:31.307 --> 01:13:34.242
Don't believe anything
this guy says.

01:13:34.243 --> 01:13:36.811
Fuckin' people!

01:13:36.812 --> 01:13:39.713
Talk about everything!

01:13:41.417 --> 01:13:42.884
Last call!

01:13:47.223 --> 01:13:48.723
It's not even time!

01:13:48.724 --> 01:13:50.625
Right. Drink up.

01:13:50.626 --> 01:13:52.594
<i>Ooh, ooh</i>

01:13:52.595 --> 01:13:54.462
<i>Ooh, ooh, ooh</i>

01:13:54.463 --> 01:13:56.564
<i>But I can't find</i>

01:13:56.565 --> 01:14:00.135
<i>My way home</i>

01:14:00.136 --> 01:14:05.173
<i>Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh</i>

01:14:05.174 --> 01:14:10.879
<i>But I can't find my way home</i>

01:14:10.880 --> 01:14:15.884
<i>Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh</i>

01:14:15.885 --> 01:14:21.222
<i>But I can't find my way home</i>

01:14:21.223 --> 01:14:22.857
<i>Still I can't find</i>

01:14:22.858 --> 01:14:26.561
<i>My way home</i>

01:14:26.562 --> 01:14:29.631
<i>And I ain't done nothing</i>

01:14:29.632 --> 01:14:31.967
<i>Wrong</i>

01:14:31.968 --> 01:14:33.034
<i>But I</i>

01:14:33.035 --> 01:14:40.635
<i>Can't find my way home</i>

01:14:52.521 --> 01:14:54.022
It's in the paper!

01:14:54.023 --> 01:14:55.390
What?

01:14:55.391 --> 01:14:57.993
That Leon was killed again.

01:14:57.994 --> 01:14:59.494
What? Why would they say that?

01:14:59.495 --> 01:15:02.964
Because they found his
body in the street!

01:15:02.965 --> 01:15:06.412
Why did they find his body
in the street, Mickey?

01:15:08.104 --> 01:15:10.772
I didn't have the money
to pay to bury Leon,

01:15:10.773 --> 01:15:12.941
so I took the truck
to Little Eddie's,

01:15:12.942 --> 01:15:16.845
but his guy took it out and
wrecked it, and Leon fell out.

01:15:16.846 --> 01:15:19.547
What?

01:15:19.548 --> 01:15:21.755
What?

01:15:23.686 --> 01:15:26.018
Leon was in the truck.

01:15:27.323 --> 01:15:29.018
No.

01:15:30.693 --> 01:15:32.527
With the meat?

01:15:32.528 --> 01:15:34.696
He was separated from the meat.

01:15:34.697 --> 01:15:36.665
I knew that would upset you.

01:15:37.666 --> 01:15:39.401
Where is he now?

01:15:39.402 --> 01:15:41.736
He's at Jack's.

01:15:41.737 --> 01:15:44.039
And it's all settled.

01:15:44.040 --> 01:15:46.007
He was just a baby!

01:15:46.008 --> 01:15:48.676
And it's in the paper.

01:15:48.677 --> 01:15:50.678
I'm sorry, Jeanie.

01:15:50.679 --> 01:15:54.160
But it's... it's nothing
to be ashamed of...

01:15:55.418 --> 01:15:58.453
you know, people
having money problems.

01:15:58.454 --> 01:16:00.945
I have to live in
this neighborhood!

01:16:02.224 --> 01:16:04.715
And everybody's gonna know.

01:16:07.396 --> 01:16:10.899
Everybody already knows...

01:16:10.900 --> 01:16:13.391
everything.

01:16:17.406 --> 01:16:21.399
Until recently, you only had
to die once in this city...

01:16:23.279 --> 01:16:25.907
even if you came from God's Pocket.

01:16:27.483 --> 01:16:31.753
There was a time when a 23-year-old
working man could die once,

01:16:31.754 --> 01:16:36.424
have the event noticed
in his local newspaper,

01:16:36.425 --> 01:16:38.760
and then move on to his reward

01:16:38.761 --> 01:16:41.596
without the complications
of an additional death.

01:16:41.597 --> 01:16:43.264
Give us this day our daily bread...

01:16:43.265 --> 01:16:45.934
Leon Hubbard's death was
reported incorrectly

01:16:45.935 --> 01:16:49.270
by this newspaper last week.

01:16:49.271 --> 01:16:52.445
But, then, Leon Hubbard
wasn't important.

01:16:53.876 --> 01:16:56.413
Mickey. Oh, motherfucker!

01:16:59.281 --> 01:17:02.550
Leon Hubbard was like the other
working people of God's Pocket...

01:17:02.551 --> 01:17:07.355
dirty-faced, uneducated,
neat as a pin inside.

01:17:07.356 --> 01:17:09.358
Motherfucker!

01:17:13.095 --> 01:17:18.032
They Work, marry, and have
children who inhabit the Pocket,

01:17:18.033 --> 01:17:21.514
often in the homes of their
mothers and fathers.

01:17:25.808 --> 01:17:29.144
They drink at The Hollywood
or the Uptown Bar...

01:17:29.145 --> 01:17:31.646
little places deep in the city,

01:17:31.647 --> 01:17:34.983
and they argue there about
things they don't understand...

01:17:34.984 --> 01:17:38.795
politics, race, religion.

01:17:40.789 --> 01:17:44.930
And in the end, they die
like everyone else...

01:17:46.428 --> 01:17:49.030
Leaving their families
and their houses

01:17:49.031 --> 01:17:52.057
and their legends.

01:17:56.906 --> 01:17:59.932
And there is a dignity in that.

01:18:02.311 --> 01:18:04.913
We owe Leon Hubbard an apology

01:18:04.914 --> 01:18:08.783
and all the people who knew him
and loved him and worked with him.

01:18:08.784 --> 01:18:11.586
If we stop listening to
Leon Hubbard's story

01:18:11.587 --> 01:18:14.355
and all the neighborhood
stories like it,

01:18:14.356 --> 01:18:17.837
eventually the neighborhoods
will stop listening to ours.

01:18:41.383 --> 01:18:43.484
<i>Packed my bags, I'm ready</i>

01:18:43.485 --> 01:18:46.454
Give me a beer.

01:18:46.455 --> 01:18:48.056
<i>To go down to the city</i>

01:18:48.057 --> 01:18:49.691
Mr. Shellburn, nothing personal,

01:18:49.692 --> 01:18:51.993
but I think that I better
ask you to leave...

01:18:51.994 --> 01:18:54.996
for your own good.

01:18:54.997 --> 01:18:57.329
Give me a beer.

01:19:00.436 --> 01:19:03.538
What the fuck are you writing
about us in the papers for?

01:19:03.539 --> 01:19:05.340
How is it your business what we do?

01:19:05.341 --> 01:19:07.582
Calling us ignorant, dirty-faced.

01:19:08.477 --> 01:19:10.478
That was a compliment.

01:19:10.479 --> 01:19:12.480
You work for a living.
You get dirty.

01:19:12.481 --> 01:19:14.315
That's dirty hands.

01:19:14.316 --> 01:19:16.651
Dirty-faced, you don't take a bath.

01:19:16.652 --> 01:19:17.986
I mean, you ain't from around here,

01:19:17.987 --> 01:19:19.587
and you're making us
look like assholes.

01:19:19.588 --> 01:19:20.855
You don't fucking know us.

01:19:20.856 --> 01:19:23.024
No, I don't... I didn't
make you assholes.

01:19:23.025 --> 01:19:24.392
I said the opposite.

01:19:24.393 --> 01:19:26.394
If he wasn't busy
fucking Leon's mother,

01:19:26.395 --> 01:19:29.063
he might have noticed everybody
in here ain't dirty.

01:19:29.064 --> 01:19:30.298
No offense, Mickey.

01:19:30.299 --> 01:19:31.566
All right, maybe we all
ought to calm down.

01:19:31.567 --> 01:19:33.768
Fuck calm down. What
is he doing down here?

01:19:33.769 --> 01:19:36.237
I'm down here because
of a misunderstanding.

01:19:36.238 --> 01:19:38.139
- That's why...
- Misunderstanding, my ass.

01:19:38.140 --> 01:19:40.108
This motherfucker came
here to get fucked up.

01:19:40.109 --> 01:19:42.777
This is my city.

01:19:42.778 --> 01:19:44.345
- Bullshit.
- Fuck you.

01:19:44.346 --> 01:19:45.613
But I'm on your side!

01:19:45.614 --> 01:19:47.382
- Take it outside, Danny.
- Wait a minute.

01:19:47.383 --> 01:19:48.816
- Let's go.
- Stop!

01:19:48.817 --> 01:19:49.851
- It's his own fault.
- What the fuck?

01:19:49.852 --> 01:19:51.452
Because of something he wrote?

01:19:51.453 --> 01:19:52.887
- Take it outside!
- Come on. Go.

01:19:52.888 --> 01:19:54.188
- Come on.
- Get him out.

01:19:54.189 --> 01:19:55.390
- Let's go.
- Get him out!

01:19:55.391 --> 01:19:57.191
What the fuck is wrong with you?

01:19:57.192 --> 01:19:59.467
You ain't from here either!

01:20:02.564 --> 01:20:04.432
Yeah, you piece of shit.

01:20:04.433 --> 01:20:06.134
This ain't your city, motherfucker!

01:20:06.135 --> 01:20:07.902
What are you gonna do, huh?

01:20:07.903 --> 01:20:10.638
20 of you against this old man for
something he wrote in the newspaper?

01:20:10.639 --> 01:20:12.140
Ain't none of your business,
Mickey, so stay out of it!

01:20:12.141 --> 01:20:14.042
Shut the fuck up!!
I don't give a fuck!

01:20:14.043 --> 01:20:16.044
Not this!

01:20:16.045 --> 01:20:18.138
Get in your car.

01:20:22.985 --> 01:20:24.714
Get him!

01:21:52.841 --> 01:21:55.321
Watch the step.

01:21:56.011 --> 01:21:57.044
Morning, Mick.

01:21:57.045 --> 01:21:58.535
Morning.

01:21:59.381 --> 01:22:00.882
You want some breakfast?

01:22:00.883 --> 01:22:04.018
I can't even think about food
this time of the morning.

01:22:04.019 --> 01:22:06.454
We better go practice, Sophie.

01:22:06.455 --> 01:22:07.922
You want to come along, Mick?

01:22:07.923 --> 01:22:09.924
I'm gonna read the paper.

01:22:09.925 --> 01:22:11.526
You don't mind if we do.

01:22:11.527 --> 01:22:13.802
It's all right. Just be careful.

01:22:14.296 --> 01:22:15.696
Mm-hmm.

01:22:15.697 --> 01:22:16.864
Oh.

01:22:16.865 --> 01:22:18.199
Let me get those.

01:22:18.200 --> 01:22:19.233
Jesus.

01:22:19.234 --> 01:22:20.968
Would you put something
on those legs?

01:22:20.969 --> 01:22:22.703
Yeah.

01:22:22.704 --> 01:22:23.838
Sweetheart.

01:22:23.839 --> 01:22:25.636
Yeah.

01:22:28.277 --> 01:22:30.611
Ah, Christ.

01:22:30.612 --> 01:22:32.447
We got to keep our guard up, Mick.

01:22:32.448 --> 01:22:34.949
You never fucking know.

01:22:34.950 --> 01:22:38.853
Bird, I can't stay forever.

01:22:38.854 --> 01:22:41.456
I got to get a job,
start something.

01:22:41.457 --> 01:22:44.826
You'll be here when
they come, Mick.

01:22:44.827 --> 01:22:46.886
You'll know what to do.

01:23:11.286 --> 01:23:13.322
A little bit to your left.

01:23:14.690 --> 01:23:16.726
Okay, that was better.

01:23:20.562 --> 01:23:23.338
Yeah, yeah... and try not to shake.

01:23:27.836 --> 01:23:32.340
<i>Last night I had a
fight with a bottle</i>

01:23:32.341 --> 01:23:36.377
<i>A bottle full of whiskey bourbon</i>

01:23:36.378 --> 01:23:40.581
<i>I started a fight with a bottle</i>

01:23:40.582 --> 01:23:42.483
<i>And if you think I look bad</i>

01:23:42.484 --> 01:23:45.253
<i>You should see him</i>

01:23:45.254 --> 01:23:49.357
<i>Dad was a down-dirty fighter</i>

01:23:49.358 --> 01:23:53.694
<i>He taught us a lesson or two</i>

01:23:53.695 --> 01:23:57.865
<i>I may be a lovely young flower</i>

01:23:57.866 --> 01:24:02.103
<i>But I'll kick all
the dirt out of you</i>

01:24:02.104 --> 01:24:06.607
<i>Yeah, I was banging
nails with a hammer</i>

01:24:06.608 --> 01:24:10.778
<i>The day I found that
blood was really red</i>

01:24:10.779 --> 01:24:15.016
<i>Yeah, I was banging
nails with a hammer</i>

01:24:15.017 --> 01:24:19.687
<i>It turned out that the
hammer was my head</i>

01:24:19.688 --> 01:24:23.624
<i>Mama was a cold-blooded lover</i>

01:24:23.625 --> 01:24:27.995
<i>She taught us a lesson or three</i>

01:24:27.996 --> 01:24:32.033
<i>I may be a lovely young flower</i>

01:24:32.034 --> 01:24:36.370
<i>But you won't take
the piss out of me</i>

01:24:53.522 --> 01:24:57.925
<i>Yeah, Dad was a down-dirty fighter</i>

01:24:57.926 --> 01:25:02.263
