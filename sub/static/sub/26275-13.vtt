WEBVTT

00:01.602 --> 00:02.770
JOE:
So the scientist says,

00:02.870 --> 00:04.004
"The last time
I saw that monkey,

00:04.105 --> 00:05.273
he was on the elephant,

00:05.373 --> 00:08.342
trying to put the cork back in."
(laughs)

00:11.379 --> 00:14.582
I'm sorry, is-is--
was that the punch line

00:14.682 --> 00:16.917
or is there another
45 minutes to that joke?

00:17.017 --> 00:19.387
Oh, come on, it's a classic.

00:19.487 --> 00:20.721
Joe, Joe.

00:20.821 --> 00:23.257
Let me give you a tip
on how to tell a joke, right?

00:23.357 --> 00:26.194
Now, it's-it's a simple,
simple tip.

00:26.294 --> 00:27.861
Never do it again.

00:30.931 --> 00:32.933
Oh, that joke's hilarious,
you just don't get it.

00:33.033 --> 00:34.702
It's possible I didn't get it;
it was complex.

00:34.802 --> 00:37.071
An elephant with diarrhea,
who would get that?

00:37.171 --> 00:39.807
Sorry I am late.

00:39.907 --> 00:42.042
Carol and I went out
for breakfast

00:42.143 --> 00:43.711
and I started talking about
our anniversary

00:43.811 --> 00:45.146
and I lost track of time.

00:45.246 --> 00:46.647
Wow. What anniversary is it?

00:46.747 --> 00:48.249
Oh, 25 years next Saturday.

00:48.349 --> 00:49.450
-Congratulations.
-Thanks.

00:49.550 --> 00:50.718
Vanessa and I are 35 years.

00:50.818 --> 00:52.420
Yeah, I know, Carol and I
like having

00:52.520 --> 00:54.255
marriage old-timers as friends.

00:54.355 --> 00:56.324
In fact, I wanted
to talk to you about that.

00:56.424 --> 00:58.626
I'm done listening for the day.
Blame him.

00:59.660 --> 01:01.729
Oh, you were telling jokes?

01:03.631 --> 01:06.234
-Scientist, and a monkey
and an elephant, okay?
-Oh.

01:06.334 --> 01:07.968
The one where he has diarrhea?

01:10.070 --> 01:12.673
Not cool.

01:12.773 --> 01:14.908
W-Wait, here's how
you tell a joke. Knock, knock.

01:15.008 --> 01:16.244
-Uh, who's there?
-Crossbow.

01:16.344 --> 01:18.112
-Crossbow, who?
-Crossbow, get back to work

01:18.212 --> 01:20.748
or I'm gonna shoot you
in the ass with a crossbow.

01:22.583 --> 01:24.585
*

01:29.423 --> 01:30.791
-Hey, baby.
-Hey.

01:30.891 --> 01:32.760
How was your night out
with Carol?

01:32.860 --> 01:34.995
A little wine with dinner

01:35.095 --> 01:36.964
or a little dinner
with wine or...

01:37.064 --> 01:38.432
a little wine with wine?

01:40.168 --> 01:42.670
We had pretzels.

01:42.770 --> 01:44.872
In the Uber. (laughs)

01:46.940 --> 01:48.776
Guess what Chuck and Carol
are gonna do

01:48.876 --> 01:50.711
for their 25th anniversary?

01:50.811 --> 01:52.846
They are going to get married.

01:52.946 --> 01:55.015
-Oh.
-Yeah.

01:55.115 --> 01:57.685
Okay, I'm a simple
country boy, but...

01:57.785 --> 01:59.720
the fact that they have
an anniversary would suggest

01:59.820 --> 02:01.689
that they're already married.

02:01.789 --> 02:04.792
Well, that was a quickie
ceremony before Chuck deployed.

02:04.892 --> 02:06.026
They always planned on having

02:06.126 --> 02:08.128
a bigger wedding ceremony
someday and I guess

02:08.229 --> 02:10.698
after 25 years, they decided
they better get on it.

02:10.798 --> 02:12.966
Great story.
Give them a gravy boat.

02:13.066 --> 02:15.636
Oh, I am giving them
more than that.

02:15.736 --> 02:18.972
You are looking at
Carol's matron of honor.

02:19.072 --> 02:20.908
-Uh, good, good.
-Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

02:21.008 --> 02:22.910
-We'll get to eat first.
-Hmm.

02:23.010 --> 02:26.046
Uh, so, Carol told me that Chuck
wants you to be involved, too,

02:26.146 --> 02:28.015
but he's a little nervous
about asking you.

02:28.115 --> 02:30.884
That's what he wanted
to talk about this morning.

02:30.984 --> 02:32.853
He wants me to be the best man.

02:32.953 --> 02:34.488
Hmm, what makes you think that?

02:34.588 --> 02:35.723
Come on.

02:35.823 --> 02:37.825
Who would be better
at it than me?

02:37.925 --> 02:40.661
(laughs) Huh, I'm stumped.

02:40.761 --> 02:42.062
Is that the right answer?

02:42.162 --> 02:45.098
I'm funny, dependable,
look good in a tux.

02:45.199 --> 02:48.336
-Hell, I could host the Oscars.
-All right.

02:49.903 --> 02:51.171
So, what's the problem?

02:51.272 --> 02:53.207
Being the best man is an honor.

02:53.307 --> 02:55.443
It seems like an honor;
it's actually a pain in the ass.

02:55.543 --> 02:59.280
It'd be like being
the White House chief of staff.

02:59.380 --> 03:01.515
That's something else
I could do.

03:05.353 --> 03:07.355
These cakes are beautiful,
but Kristin,

03:07.455 --> 03:09.022
this is asking way too much.

03:09.122 --> 03:10.424
No, no, Carol,
the guys in the kitchen

03:10.524 --> 03:12.393
really want to do this
for you and Chuck.

03:12.493 --> 03:14.695
They're dying to make something
other than the sheet cake

03:14.795 --> 03:17.197
that we give away to people
who lie about their birthdays.

03:18.432 --> 03:19.733
Carol, you told me
the first time

03:19.833 --> 03:20.734
that you and Chuck got married,

03:20.834 --> 03:22.102
you split a piece of pumpkin pie

03:22.202 --> 03:23.136
at the bus station.

03:23.237 --> 03:24.372
Come on, you deserve this.

03:24.472 --> 03:25.973
Well, I... guess.

03:26.073 --> 03:27.941
I'll take the four-tier praline
with the marzipan fondant

03:28.041 --> 03:30.210
-and the crystalized
lemon blossoms.
-Oh. Okay.

03:30.311 --> 03:32.212
Oh, yikes, Carol, come on.

03:32.313 --> 03:34.081
-We got to pick up your dress.
-Oh! Yes.

03:34.181 --> 03:36.049
Oh, thank you so much, Kristin.

03:36.149 --> 03:39.086
And you know what the worst part
about all of this is now?

03:39.186 --> 03:41.655
-I want some cake.
-(laughs)

03:41.755 --> 03:43.123
-Bye, guys.
-Bye.

03:43.223 --> 03:44.992
Hey, Kris, you want to watch
Lovers and Losers?

03:45.092 --> 03:46.894
-It's hot tub elimination night.
-Oh, no, no, no, no.

03:46.994 --> 03:48.462
I'm taping it at home. (laughs)

03:48.562 --> 03:51.632
Who am I kidding?
I'm gonna watch it twice anyway.

03:51.732 --> 03:54.001
Can I watch, too?
We have this show in Hong Kong

03:54.101 --> 03:56.304
but it's called
Daughter Shame Family.

03:56.404 --> 03:58.672
-(laughs)
-Uh, sure, Jen.

03:58.772 --> 04:01.642
-Hey, are those my earrings?
-Uh...

04:01.742 --> 04:03.311
I don't know. Who cares?

04:03.411 --> 04:05.413
I do. You went into my room
without asking.

04:05.513 --> 04:07.247
KRISTIN:
(scoffs) When I lived here,

04:07.348 --> 04:08.916
you took my stuff all the time.

04:09.016 --> 04:10.418
No, I didn't. Your stuff sucks.

04:10.518 --> 04:12.252
KRISTIN:
Yes, you did, liar.

04:12.353 --> 04:13.854
No, I didn't, psycho.

04:13.954 --> 04:17.157
Fine, take them, okay?
They're ugly anyway.

04:17.257 --> 04:20.193
-Buy your own earrings, loser.
-Buttface!

04:22.195 --> 04:24.932
That is a daughter
who shames family.

04:27.835 --> 04:29.837
(tapping watch)

04:30.871 --> 04:32.172
-Uh, Ed.
-Hmm?

04:32.272 --> 04:34.875
I think this meeting
was over ten minutes ago.

04:34.975 --> 04:36.544
You're just stalling
'cause you don't want

04:36.644 --> 04:38.779
to go back to your office.

04:38.879 --> 04:40.614
Now that's insulting.

04:42.550 --> 04:44.952
I have plenty of important
things to talk about.

04:45.052 --> 04:47.120
Okay, I'm sorry.

04:47.220 --> 04:48.956
Boy, that Ann-Margret
had a great pair

04:49.056 --> 04:50.391
of getaway sticks, huh?

04:51.559 --> 04:52.960
Hey, when you two are finished,

04:53.060 --> 04:55.028
I need a minute of
your time, Baxter.

04:55.128 --> 04:57.230
-Oh, we're done,
we're done, we're done.
-Oh, great. I'll be right in.

04:57.331 --> 04:59.333
Why did you tell him
we were done?

04:59.433 --> 05:00.968
Because you said we were done.

05:01.068 --> 05:02.235
What is it?

05:02.336 --> 05:04.237
-What's wrong?
-Chuck wants to ask me

05:04.338 --> 05:06.139
to do something and
I'm trying to get out of it,

05:06.239 --> 05:08.141
so just back me on this, okay?

05:08.241 --> 05:09.810
(sighs) So...

05:09.910 --> 05:11.512
I guess you heard
that Carol and I

05:11.612 --> 05:13.381
-are retying the knot.
-I'd love to talk about it

05:13.481 --> 05:14.982
-when I get back in town, okay?
-Uh...

05:15.082 --> 05:16.817
What, you're-you're leaving?

05:16.917 --> 05:19.487
I was gonna ask you to be a part
of it. W-When do you go?

05:19.587 --> 05:21.589
(stammering)
W-When's the wedding?

05:21.689 --> 05:23.557
Next Saturday.

05:23.657 --> 05:26.394
Next Saturday.
As luck would have it,

05:26.494 --> 05:28.696
that's when Ed and I
are doing this thing, right, Ed?

05:28.796 --> 05:30.163
Right? What are we doing?
The thing we're doing?

05:30.263 --> 05:31.832
Well, I don't know
what you're doing,

05:31.932 --> 05:34.334
but I've been asked to be
an usher at Chuck's wedding.

05:35.669 --> 05:38.672
And as I said before,
I'm honored.

05:40.841 --> 05:43.076
(sighs)
Man, it's okay, Baxter.

05:43.176 --> 05:44.912
If you don't want to be
a part of it, that's...

05:45.012 --> 05:46.947
-that's fine, man.
-No, it's not-- forget it,

05:47.047 --> 05:49.583
it's not that, you know,
I just don't...

05:49.683 --> 05:51.351
I don't know
what's the matter with me.

05:53.086 --> 05:55.956
If you want me to do it,
I'm not gonna stand in the way

05:56.056 --> 05:58.692
-of having
an exceptional wedding.
-(chuckles)

05:58.792 --> 06:01.895
Okay, I got a list of websites
where you can get ordained.

06:01.995 --> 06:03.296
It's quick and painless.

06:03.397 --> 06:05.232
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

06:07.635 --> 06:09.369
You want me
to o-officiate the wedding?

06:09.470 --> 06:10.771
Oh, yeah. (scoffs)

06:10.871 --> 06:13.206
I mean, even though
we're already legally married,

06:13.306 --> 06:15.208
Carol wants it,
you know, all proper.

06:15.308 --> 06:17.210
Why-- right, well,
I-I-I could officiate it.

06:17.310 --> 06:18.946
That'd be all right, yeah.

06:19.046 --> 06:21.381
I don't know if it'd be proper,
I got quite a mouth on me.

06:21.482 --> 06:23.817
(laughs)
Yeah, thanks, Baxter.

06:23.917 --> 06:25.719
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Hey, Chuck, uh...

06:25.819 --> 06:27.621
who are you getting to be
the best man?

06:27.721 --> 06:29.657
Uh, probably one
of your Marine buddies.

06:29.757 --> 06:31.425
Oh, no. Most of my guys
are still overseas.

06:31.525 --> 06:32.626
Oh. Huh.

06:32.726 --> 06:34.394
(stammers)

06:34.495 --> 06:36.730
Who's gonna be the best man?

06:36.830 --> 06:39.900
Hey, Reverend, looks like
we got a wedding to plan.

06:40.000 --> 06:41.602
(Joe laughing)

06:49.610 --> 06:51.745
So yesterday you were mad
because you thought

06:51.845 --> 06:54.615
-Chuck was gonna ask you
to be his best man.
-(exhales)

06:54.715 --> 06:56.416
Today you're mad because
he didn't ask you.

06:58.686 --> 07:00.821
Maybe you just like being mad.

07:00.921 --> 07:03.256
Of course I do.

07:03.356 --> 07:06.760
I'm not mad because he didn't
ask me to be the best man.

07:06.860 --> 07:10.130
I'm mad because he asked Joe
to be the best man.

07:10.230 --> 07:12.500
Honey, he asked you
to perform the ceremony,

07:12.600 --> 07:16.003
-that's a big honor.
-Give me a break.

07:16.103 --> 07:17.671
Officiating at a wedding

07:17.771 --> 07:20.373
is like being the DJ at
a strip bar, you know that.

07:20.474 --> 07:22.142
(mouthing)

07:22.242 --> 07:24.778
Nobody's there to see you.

07:26.947 --> 07:30.217
Well, that must be some
of the deep spiritual insight

07:30.317 --> 07:33.120
he knows you'll bring
to the ceremony.

07:33.220 --> 07:35.455
What's so special
about the best man's job?

07:35.556 --> 07:37.958
The best man gives that
funny speech at the reception.

07:38.058 --> 07:40.561
The big speech, the big fun;
it goes on YouTube.

07:40.661 --> 07:42.229
And Joe's gonna give that.

07:42.329 --> 07:44.364
Well, why not?
He seems like a funny guy.

07:44.464 --> 07:46.299
My God, who are you?

07:48.468 --> 07:50.470
(doorbell rings)

07:50.571 --> 07:52.305
-Oh, there he is.
-Mm-hmm.

07:52.405 --> 07:54.808
I was hoping I could pound
a few more beers down

07:54.908 --> 07:58.512
before the wedding meeting
he insisted on having.

07:58.612 --> 08:00.548
Well, it sounds like Joe
is taking his role

08:00.648 --> 08:03.917
in the ceremony seriously
and you should do the same.

08:04.017 --> 08:05.385
(grunts) Okay, okay, okay.

08:05.485 --> 08:06.820
-(doorbell rings)
-Hey.

08:06.920 --> 08:08.656
-Do we have any vodka?
-Answer the door.

08:08.756 --> 08:10.591
Go, get out.

08:15.228 --> 08:16.429
Reverend Mike.

08:16.530 --> 08:20.200
-Shecky Greene.
-Let's make this quick, okay?

08:20.300 --> 08:22.570
'Cause I'm doing New Talent
Night at the comedy club.

08:22.670 --> 08:24.672
I'm workshopping my
best man speech.

08:24.772 --> 08:27.841
It is gonna be a killer.
Oh, man.

08:27.941 --> 08:31.178
Honey, can you pour me a glass
of what we talked about?

08:31.278 --> 08:33.346
VANESSA:
No.

08:33.446 --> 08:34.782
Hey, let's get started, huh?

08:34.882 --> 08:36.684
Okay. Let's get started.

08:38.518 --> 08:42.389
Listen, I'm really sorry
about how things worked out.

08:42.489 --> 08:43.757
What do you mean? What?

08:43.857 --> 08:45.793
About our jobs at the wedding.

08:45.893 --> 08:47.427
I'm sure you've got
to be disappointed.

08:47.527 --> 08:50.130
I'm the best man.

08:50.230 --> 08:52.299
It's the best thing
you can be, okay?

08:52.399 --> 08:54.568
"Best" is in the job title.

08:55.636 --> 08:57.738
Being a best man
at a wedding is like

08:57.838 --> 08:59.807
being a DJ at a strip club.

09:01.875 --> 09:03.877
Nobody's there to see you.

09:05.545 --> 09:07.114
No, that's ridiculous, okay?

09:07.214 --> 09:08.949
Tommy Thunder
at Nudes, Nudes, Nudes?

09:09.049 --> 09:12.319
He's the reason I frequent
that establishment.

09:12.419 --> 09:14.254
Listen, all I'm saying is,

09:14.354 --> 09:16.056
I've never been
the best man at a wedding

09:16.156 --> 09:17.424
when I didn't look up and go,

09:17.524 --> 09:20.327
"Boy, I wish I could be
the minister."

09:20.427 --> 09:22.462
Well, congratulations, Baxter.

09:22.562 --> 09:24.397
You are the minister, okay?

09:24.497 --> 09:25.833
You're not the DJ
at the strip club,

09:25.933 --> 09:27.334
you're not even
in the strip club.

09:27.434 --> 09:29.737
You're the weird guy that hangs
around by the front door.

09:29.837 --> 09:31.404
Not the guy with that
stocking cap, he's some kind

09:31.504 --> 09:32.906
-of security guy.
-All right, all right,

09:33.006 --> 09:35.809
all right, I get it. I get it!
I get it, I get it. I get it.

09:35.909 --> 09:38.011
Here's the deal.
Okay, we're pals, right?

09:38.111 --> 09:39.312
Yeah.

09:39.412 --> 09:41.114
Well, I'm thinking maybe
I could talk to Chuck.

09:41.214 --> 09:42.850
-Uh-huh?
-Maybe get you the gig

09:42.950 --> 09:44.584
as minister and I take the,
you know,

09:44.685 --> 09:46.654
the stupid best man job.

09:46.754 --> 09:50.523
You think you could get me,
like, a certificate?

09:50.624 --> 09:52.359
Sure, there's
a minister's certificate.

09:52.459 --> 09:54.094
No, a birth certificate, okay?

09:54.194 --> 09:56.363
'Cause apparently you think
I was born yesterday.

09:59.299 --> 10:01.168
I'm just trying to help.

10:01.268 --> 10:02.970
Hey, if you want to help,
read that.

10:03.070 --> 10:06.039
Read that when you introduce me.

10:06.139 --> 10:07.641
(stammers)

10:07.741 --> 10:10.678
"He's worked clubs and colleges
across the country"?

10:12.379 --> 10:15.048
"You've seen him on
Evening at the Improv"?

10:16.283 --> 10:17.484
-What is this?
-Okay.

10:17.584 --> 10:20.020
I took a few liberties, okay?

10:20.120 --> 10:22.222
Just read that, then step aside

10:22.322 --> 10:25.492
and watch me level the joint.

10:25.592 --> 10:27.895
You know you do your speech
at the reception, you nitwit,

10:27.995 --> 10:29.529
not at the church.

10:29.629 --> 10:31.464
No, I'm the best man.
I'm doing it at the church

10:31.564 --> 10:33.466
'cause Chuck said
it's okay, all right?

10:33.566 --> 10:35.335
And look, excuse me.

10:35.435 --> 10:38.305
I'm 35th at the comedy club
so I got to get going.

10:40.240 --> 10:41.675
Wait a minute.

10:41.775 --> 10:44.411
When were you ever
on The Tonight Show?

10:47.514 --> 10:49.717
And look how far I've fallen.

10:56.323 --> 10:58.591
Hey, Jen, you want to help us
with the centerpieces?

10:58.692 --> 11:00.493
Oh, I have to tell
Vanessa something,

11:00.593 --> 11:02.229
but it's going to upset her.

11:02.329 --> 11:04.597
I know. Too much red. (sighs)

11:04.698 --> 11:07.000
It's a wedding, not a bullfight.

11:07.100 --> 11:10.037
Mandy and Kristin
hate each other.

11:10.137 --> 11:13.540
They got into a fight. They said
horrible things I cannot repeat.

11:13.640 --> 11:16.443
-What were they fighting about?
-Earrings.

11:16.543 --> 11:18.712
(both laugh)

11:18.812 --> 11:21.581
Oh, no, no, wait, let me guess.
Kristin took Mandy's earrings

11:21.681 --> 11:23.083
and then Mandy
threw a hissy fit.

11:23.183 --> 11:24.284
(laughs)

11:24.384 --> 11:27.387
Stop laughing and do something.

11:27.487 --> 11:30.057
-Jen doesn't have
any brothers or sisters.
-Ah.

11:30.157 --> 11:32.559
I used to want a sister more
than anything in the world,

11:32.659 --> 11:34.694
but now I am glad
I don't have one.

11:34.795 --> 11:37.364
-Trust me,
this is what sisters do.
-Yeah.

11:37.464 --> 11:40.267
They fight and they yell and
they tell each other to shut up.

11:40.367 --> 11:42.069
-It's sweet.
-(laughs)

11:42.169 --> 11:44.271
Yeah, one of the great things
about having a sister

11:44.371 --> 11:46.306
is you can fight like that
and it doesn't matter.

11:46.406 --> 11:47.941
You know you're always
gonna love each other.

11:48.041 --> 11:51.544
That sounds a little crazy.
Is it true?

11:51.644 --> 11:54.381
My sister was a giant pain.

11:54.481 --> 11:57.117
She stole my first boyfriend,
she crashed my car...

11:57.217 --> 11:58.952
I should give her a call.

11:59.052 --> 12:00.553
*

12:02.823 --> 12:04.992
I really appreciate you
taking the time, Reverend Paul.

12:05.092 --> 12:08.061
Listen, I need a few pointers
on a wedding, man.

12:08.161 --> 12:11.498
This thing's turning into
a real pain in the ass.

12:11.598 --> 12:15.635
Yeah. Just happy to help.

12:15.735 --> 12:16.837
Please, have a seat.

12:16.937 --> 12:18.271
I don't want to sit
in your chair.

12:18.371 --> 12:22.275
Oh, why not? You're a "minister"
now, too, right?

12:22.375 --> 12:25.245
Clicked on a website,
you paid ten bucks, boom!

12:25.345 --> 12:27.247
You get to wear
your collar backwards.

12:27.347 --> 12:31.684
Ten bucks? I overpaid. (laughs)

12:31.785 --> 12:36.423
Do you have any idea what a
seminary education costs, Mike?

12:36.523 --> 12:38.758
It's about 18 grand a year,
plus books.

12:38.859 --> 12:42.996
Okay, but isn't there
only the one book?

12:43.096 --> 12:47.300
The average salary
of a minister? Around 35 grand.

12:47.400 --> 12:49.803
Greeters at Walmart
make more than that.

12:49.903 --> 12:51.271
You know,
this is real interesting,

12:51.371 --> 12:52.605
but it might be something

12:52.705 --> 12:55.608
that someone should take up
with their bartender?

12:55.708 --> 12:58.211
Officiating weddings
was one of the few ways

12:58.311 --> 13:00.948
that ministers could make
a little extra money.

13:01.048 --> 13:03.450
But now, thanks to the Internet,
anyone can be ordained

13:03.550 --> 13:06.786
by the Worldwide Church
of the Holy Bozo.

13:06.887 --> 13:09.322
Let's be honest, I think
you've had a few snorts

13:09.422 --> 13:10.723
already today, haven't you?

13:10.824 --> 13:14.294
I'm sorry, this just
chaps my fanny.

13:16.129 --> 13:17.297
Okay.

13:17.397 --> 13:19.366
I'm sorry. How can I help?

13:19.466 --> 13:20.567
Okay. All right, listen.

13:20.667 --> 13:22.402
You know how to work
a congregation, right?

13:22.502 --> 13:25.305
So, I need some surefire bits
that I can do at the ceremony.

13:25.405 --> 13:28.508
"Bits"?

13:28.608 --> 13:31.478
Yeah, some class A material,
you know?

13:31.578 --> 13:33.881
I'm not a prop act,
I don't juggle,

13:33.981 --> 13:36.483
and I won't do magic.

13:36.583 --> 13:40.320
Where is this ceremony?
The Tropicana Room?

13:40.420 --> 13:42.589
The best man is Joe Leonard.
Do you know Joe?

13:42.689 --> 13:44.057
No, I don't think so.

13:44.157 --> 13:45.859
Yeah, cause-- of course not,
he's bound for Hell.

13:47.327 --> 13:49.096
Joe thinks he's funny.
He's not funny.

13:49.196 --> 13:53.600
He's really not funny, and he's
doing comedy at the ceremony.

13:53.700 --> 13:56.503
I need to blow
this guy offstage.

13:56.603 --> 13:58.939
It's called the sanctuary.

13:59.039 --> 14:01.708
Okay, okay. I'm-a blow him
off the sanctuary.

14:04.011 --> 14:07.680
-Mike, you're looking at this
completely wrong.
-Yeah?

14:07.780 --> 14:11.718
A minister at a wedding,
it's like a DJ.

14:15.555 --> 14:19.859
Exactly.
DJ at a strip club, exactly!

14:19.960 --> 14:21.761
What?

14:21.861 --> 14:26.366
I need one surefire bit
that's guaranteed a big laugh.

14:26.466 --> 14:27.767
Help me out. Big laugh.

14:27.867 --> 14:32.372
Okay. Oh. (laughing): Okay.

14:32.472 --> 14:33.573
(chuckles)

14:33.673 --> 14:36.709
There's a scientist,
an elephant, and a monkey...

14:46.486 --> 14:49.222
All right, so after I say that,
you say, you yell out...

14:49.322 --> 14:51.591
Come on, you yell out...

14:51.691 --> 14:53.994
"How fat is she?"

14:54.094 --> 14:57.297
And then I'll say,
"My wife is so fat..."

14:57.397 --> 15:00.400
Well, hang on. Mrs. B isn't fat.
Why are you saying she is?

15:00.500 --> 15:02.802
It's a joke, I'm not talking
about my wife. It's a joke.

15:02.902 --> 15:06.739
Making fun of somebody's weight
is a joke? No, sir.

15:06.839 --> 15:09.176
You want a joke? (clears throat)

15:09.276 --> 15:11.611
"What did the farmer say when
he couldn't find his tractor?"

15:11.711 --> 15:12.812
I don't know. What?

15:12.912 --> 15:15.482
"Where's my tractor?"

15:17.750 --> 15:20.253
That's a joke.

15:27.260 --> 15:29.496
Really, Joe? A guitar? What are
you gonna do, song parodies?

15:29.596 --> 15:31.098
What's the matter,
Your Holiness?

15:31.198 --> 15:32.499
You don't think they're funny?

15:32.599 --> 15:35.202
Why don't you call Weird Al
on his yacht and ask him?

15:35.302 --> 15:37.704
Pathetic.

15:37.804 --> 15:39.506
I'll be surprised
if you won't be

15:39.606 --> 15:41.474
smashing watermelons out there.

15:41.574 --> 15:45.678
(sighs) Watermelons
are out of season, genius.

15:45.778 --> 15:48.281
Oh, and don't worry
about my act, okay?

15:48.381 --> 15:50.950
Just keep your boring
minister crap short.

15:51.051 --> 15:55.388
Boring, huh? Well, I might have
a joke or two, or 50, Joe.

15:55.488 --> 15:58.791
Don't you dare, okay?
I'm headlining this gig, Baxter.

15:58.891 --> 16:01.061
You're just the DJ. (scoffs)

16:01.161 --> 16:04.797
Not today, Joe.
Today, I am the stripper.

16:04.897 --> 16:08.235
Hey, guys. Hey.
You got the ring?

16:08.335 --> 16:09.802
-What?
-Yeah.

16:09.902 --> 16:12.005
Yeah, of course I got the ring.
I'm not an idiot.

16:13.140 --> 16:14.807
I left my breath mints
in the car.

16:14.907 --> 16:16.176
I'll be back.

16:18.311 --> 16:20.013
Hey, you know,
there's a good chance

16:20.113 --> 16:22.649
you'll be slipping a breath mint
on your wife's finger today.

16:22.749 --> 16:25.485
Come on, come on. Hey, hey, hey.

16:25.585 --> 16:28.555
Relax. I'm pretty sure
she's gonna say, "I do."

16:28.655 --> 16:30.490
(chuckles)

16:30.590 --> 16:33.260
Carol said you'd
calm me down, man.

16:33.360 --> 16:35.928
Which is one of the reasons
why I asked you to do this.

16:36.029 --> 16:37.497
Really? Wh-What are some
of the other reasons?

16:37.597 --> 16:38.998
You know, instead of, uh,

16:39.099 --> 16:41.334
you know, driving the limo
or being an usher

16:41.434 --> 16:43.203
or, you know,
being the best man.

16:43.303 --> 16:46.005
The judge who married us
25 years ago

16:46.106 --> 16:48.741
had never met us before.

16:48.841 --> 16:51.944
He kept calling me Rick
through most of the ceremony.

16:52.045 --> 16:54.947
Are you sure he wasn't saying
"The Rock"?

16:55.048 --> 16:58.085
Oh, and he was single.
And-and I know that

16:58.185 --> 17:02.422
because he said all the stuff
you hear at a wedding ceremony,

17:02.522 --> 17:04.891
but it didn't sound authentic.

17:04.991 --> 17:06.593
So when we decided

17:06.693 --> 17:11.298
to renew our vows, we wanted
the officiant to be...

17:11.398 --> 17:13.933
someone who'd been around
the block a few times.

17:14.033 --> 17:15.702
(chuckles) Well, you know me.

17:15.802 --> 17:17.437
I've been circling
that block for 35 years.

17:17.537 --> 17:20.039
Yeah. Exactly.

17:22.109 --> 17:24.043
You and Vanessa have
the same kind of marriage

17:24.144 --> 17:27.880
Carol and I have.
Long, solid and honest.

17:28.915 --> 17:31.451
And who better to bless it?

17:35.388 --> 17:37.824
I am really honored
you asked me, my friend.

17:37.924 --> 17:39.492
Yeah, man.

17:39.592 --> 17:44.331
Oh, and the worst part about
the guy who did it 25 years ago,

17:44.431 --> 17:48.235
he kept trying to be funny.

17:48.335 --> 17:51.504
Well, it could've been worse,
you know?

17:51.604 --> 17:53.573
He could've played the guitar.

18:00.913 --> 18:02.282
KRISTIN:
Mom!

18:02.382 --> 18:03.583
We got to go!

18:07.820 --> 18:09.622
Can I help with anything?

18:11.758 --> 18:12.992
Yeah, sure, Jen.
Can you put

18:13.092 --> 18:14.427
some of these corsages
in the box?

18:14.527 --> 18:17.964
What's that? What did you say?

18:18.064 --> 18:22.001
Actually, can you just grab
the camera bag?

18:22.101 --> 18:24.771
This camera bag?

18:24.871 --> 18:26.506
KRISTIN:
Yeah.

18:26.606 --> 18:30.143
Oh. Are you wearing
Mandy's earrings?

18:30.243 --> 18:31.878
No.

18:31.978 --> 18:34.847
Wow, they-they look great
on you.

18:34.947 --> 18:37.617
I didn't steal them. Shut up!

18:37.717 --> 18:40.820
I mean, it's totally fine.
You should keep them.

18:40.920 --> 18:42.289
They look way better
on you anyway.

18:42.389 --> 18:44.957
Yeah, yeah, whatever.

18:47.026 --> 18:49.629
Uh, girls,

18:49.729 --> 18:52.365
I need you to do me
a weird favor.

18:53.966 --> 18:57.204
Hey, Jen, did you go
into my room without asking?

18:57.304 --> 18:59.372
-Because that is not cool.
-Yeah, what were you thinking?

18:59.472 --> 19:00.707
You have your own stupid room.

19:00.807 --> 19:04.311
That you... better stay out of.

19:04.411 --> 19:07.980
Hey! That used to be my room.

19:08.080 --> 19:11.818
(scoffs)
Yeah, back when it sucked.

19:11.918 --> 19:13.820
Give me the earrings.

19:13.920 --> 19:15.755
You just said
I could have them. Liar.

19:15.855 --> 19:16.989
-Stealer!
-Loser!

19:17.089 --> 19:18.658
-Psycho!
-(laughs)

19:18.758 --> 19:21.394
Hey, hey, what's going on?

19:21.494 --> 19:24.163
It's okay, Vanessa,
we were just talking.

19:24.264 --> 19:26.766
-Yeah, Mom. Butt out.
-It's a sister thing.

19:26.866 --> 19:29.402
Hmm. Well, you sisters
better get going.

19:29.502 --> 19:33.172
Fine, you can wear
the earrings, today.

19:39.246 --> 19:42.014
"Love never fails.

19:42.114 --> 19:44.384
"These three remain forever:

19:44.484 --> 19:47.454
"faith, hope and love.

19:47.554 --> 19:51.691
But the greatest
of these is love."

19:53.760 --> 19:56.195
Not one laugh.

19:58.965 --> 20:01.200
Thank you, Kyle. Well,

20:01.301 --> 20:03.570
I get to talk now,
which, as many of you know,

20:03.670 --> 20:06.038
one of my favorite things.

20:06.138 --> 20:08.541
I'm supposed to talk about
being married for a long time,

20:08.641 --> 20:11.210
another one
of my favorite things,

20:11.311 --> 20:13.813
but instead, I'm gonna talk
about my very favorite thing:

20:13.913 --> 20:15.047
cars.

20:18.718 --> 20:20.887
Specifically, I want to talk
about classic cars

20:20.987 --> 20:22.789
because being married
for a long time

20:22.889 --> 20:25.792
is a lot like owning
a classic car.

20:25.892 --> 20:28.728
I think about that when I look
at my lovely wife, Vanessa.

20:28.828 --> 20:31.898
How fat is she?

20:40.573 --> 20:42.909
When you have a classic car,

20:43.009 --> 20:45.612
you don't take it
for granted, right?

20:45.712 --> 20:47.447
You don't assume
it's always gonna work.

20:47.547 --> 20:49.916
You got to take care of it,
got to tinker with it.

20:50.016 --> 20:51.150
You got to listen to it.

20:51.250 --> 20:55.688
It's not a lot of work,
but you do it every day.

20:55.788 --> 20:58.758
And those days turn into weeks,
the weeks turn into years.

20:58.858 --> 21:00.360
If you're lucky,
they turn into decades.

21:00.460 --> 21:05.332
But that car's gonna run like
a top, like it was brand-new.

21:05.432 --> 21:09.936
And when everybody sees it,
they all say,

21:10.036 --> 21:12.271
"I wish I had one of those."

21:16.609 --> 21:21.147
He's better than Tommy Thunder
at Nudes, Nudes, Nudes.

21:21.247 --> 21:24.150
Oh, you're that guy
that's going to Hell.

21:28.788 --> 21:30.222
No, no. It wasn't that bad, Joe.

21:30.323 --> 21:31.991
I think people enjoyed
your speech.

21:32.091 --> 21:34.694
I was there.
Nobody enjoyed his speech,

21:34.794 --> 21:37.129
which is why I loved it.

21:37.229 --> 21:39.732
Say what you want.
I did get one big laugh.

21:39.832 --> 21:41.701
(chuckles): Yeah,
when you dropped that guitar.

21:41.801 --> 21:43.536
Yeah, that was great.

21:43.636 --> 21:46.639
And that breakaway neck you had
on it made it super funny.

21:48.140 --> 21:49.842
-Yeah, it was a great wedding.
-Mm-hmm.

21:49.942 --> 21:52.011
Hope the Larabees have fun
on their honeymoon in Vegas.

21:52.111 --> 21:54.481
I was surprised to hear
that Chuck is an Elton John fan.

21:54.581 --> 21:56.716
-Yeah, me, too.
-Yeah, I wish I had known.

21:56.816 --> 21:58.485
I would have incorporated it
into my act.

21:58.585 --> 22:00.653
Then you could have
dropped a piano.

22:00.753 --> 22:02.922
Hey, uh, while Chuck's gone,

22:03.022 --> 22:04.891
who's gonna be in charge
of security at the store?

22:04.991 --> 22:06.926
Who cares? Now you can take
whatever you want

22:07.026 --> 22:08.661
'cause who's gonna
stop you, Joe?

22:13.500 --> 22:15.768
This is gonna be
a real fun two weeks.

22:23.676 --> 22:26.946
-Look at you,
sitting at Chuck's desk.
-Yep.

22:27.046 --> 22:29.281
Our head of security
may go on a honeymoon,

22:29.382 --> 22:31.518
but crime never does.

22:31.618 --> 22:33.019
Have you seen their pictures
from Vegas?

22:33.119 --> 22:34.854
They are having a great time.

22:34.954 --> 22:36.856
Oh, yes. Ah, Vegas. Yeah.

22:36.956 --> 22:39.058
I bet Redford
could get Demi Moore

22:39.158 --> 22:41.628
for a lot less
than a million bucks these days.

22:42.862 --> 22:44.764
Uh, so, don't take this wrong,

22:44.864 --> 22:47.033
but do you even know
what you're doing?

22:47.133 --> 22:49.135
Oh, I'm getting the hang of it.
I'm getting the hang of it. Mm.

22:49.235 --> 22:52.204
-See, this camera here
is for the loading dock. See?
-Yeah.

22:52.304 --> 22:56.375
-And this one's
for the main retail area.
-Mm-hmm.

22:56.476 --> 22:59.646
And this one's always good
for a laugh.

22:59.746 --> 23:01.280
(clears throat)

23:01.380 --> 23:04.116
(echoing):
Checking, check, check, check.

23:04.216 --> 23:08.220
Paging Mr. Kaseltzer.

23:08.320 --> 23:09.889
Mr. Al Kaseltzer.

23:12.224 --> 23:13.893
Ha! I-I only do that

23:13.993 --> 23:15.728
because the store hasn't
opened yet. That's...

23:15.828 --> 23:19.732
-Yeah. We opened 20 minutes ago.
-I knew that.

23:19.832 --> 23:22.602
I knew that, I knew that.
Okay, uh... (clears throat)

23:22.702 --> 23:25.838
Disregard the previous
announcement for Mr. Kaseltzer.

23:27.907 --> 23:30.610
Mr. Alka-Seltzer.

23:32.745 --> 23:34.581
There's one thing I don't get,
is why there are so many

23:34.681 --> 23:36.415
-blind spots in the store.
-Yeah, well,

23:36.516 --> 23:37.984
whatever Chuck set up
is working.

23:38.084 --> 23:39.986
Theft has been way down
since he took over.

23:40.086 --> 23:42.589
There's got to be a better way
to beef up security here.

23:42.689 --> 23:44.290
I-I want to take a shot at it.

23:44.390 --> 23:46.493
Okay, I-I wouldn't mess
with any of Chuck's stuff.

23:46.593 --> 23:49.529
Okay, Ed? He's worked
really hard on this system,

23:49.629 --> 23:51.263
and he's got a lot of pride.

23:51.363 --> 23:54.266
Pride? Pride, well,
I have a lot of pride, too.

23:54.366 --> 23:55.835
-(clears throat)
-Oh, no.

23:55.935 --> 23:58.437
Paging Mr. Moretime.

23:58.538 --> 24:01.774
Mr. Juan Moretime.

24:09.882 --> 24:11.484
Hey, babe,
before we go to the bank,

24:11.584 --> 24:12.852
let's make sure the car
has enough gas

24:12.952 --> 24:14.220
to get us to the bank

24:14.320 --> 24:16.222
and then back from the bank.
(chuckles)

24:16.322 --> 24:17.824
MANDY/KYLE:
Oh.

24:17.924 --> 24:21.127
Hello, Mom and Dad.
Guess where we're going?

24:21.227 --> 24:23.996
Hopefully, acting lessons.

24:24.096 --> 24:26.633
Uh, no. We're going to the bank.

24:26.733 --> 24:29.235
Kyle and I are combining
our money.

24:29.335 --> 24:31.203
Yeah, since we're moving
into our first apartment

24:31.303 --> 24:33.305
together soon,
we figured it's time.

24:33.405 --> 24:34.707
All right, well,
that's a major decision.

24:34.807 --> 24:35.908
I hope you gave it some thought.

24:36.008 --> 24:38.811
Gave what thought?

24:38.911 --> 24:42.048
Combining money? Bad idea.

24:42.148 --> 24:45.384
It's like putting Trump
in a bath with Pelosi.

24:45.484 --> 24:47.319
VANESSA:
I mean, he's right.

24:47.419 --> 24:49.822
You know the number one thing
couples fight about?

24:49.922 --> 24:51.891
Who's cuter? It's him.

24:51.991 --> 24:53.092
-(scoffs) It's her.
-It's him.

24:53.192 --> 24:54.727
-It's you.
-It's you.

24:54.827 --> 24:57.163
-It's you.
-It's you.
-Hey, hey, hey! Look at me.

24:57.263 --> 24:59.732
We're talking about money.

24:59.832 --> 25:02.168
And it's her.

25:02.268 --> 25:04.837
-No, it's you.
-No, I meant you.

25:04.937 --> 25:06.238
-You. No.
-No, really. Look.

25:06.338 --> 25:07.674
-MIKE:
Look, you're the one. You are.
-No, no, no.

25:07.774 --> 25:10.009
-You are. You...
-Stop! Stop, look at me.

25:10.109 --> 25:11.844
We're talking about money.

25:15.114 --> 25:16.683
Look, it-it's harder
than you think,

25:16.783 --> 25:18.517
learning to say "our money"
instead of "my money."

25:18.618 --> 25:20.753
Especially if you're the one
making most of our money.

25:20.853 --> 25:23.756
Hey, look, I'm not embarrassed
about that.

25:23.856 --> 25:27.093
You know, for maybe five years,
I... I was a kept man.

25:27.193 --> 25:28.728
Yeah.

25:28.828 --> 25:30.630
Just spent my days,
you know, working out,

25:30.730 --> 25:32.632
going to get my nails done,
playing Parcheesi

25:32.732 --> 25:36.102
and making her happy.

25:36.202 --> 25:39.205
(exhales) Well, I just don't see
us ever arguing about money.

25:39.305 --> 25:41.207
-Kyle and I are always
on the same...
-Planet.

25:41.307 --> 25:43.075
Exactly.
(chuckles)

25:43.175 --> 25:45.377
All right, well, look.
If you guys need any advice,

25:45.477 --> 25:47.479
-feel free to ask.
-No, no. Ask her.

25:47.580 --> 25:49.616
-I don't want any part of this.
-No-- what?
You love giving advice.

25:49.716 --> 25:52.551
Only when people don't want it.

25:52.652 --> 25:54.386
Okay, we're gonna be fine.

25:54.486 --> 25:56.122
Okay, let's go.
I'm just gonna grab my purse.

25:56.222 --> 25:59.592
Uh, don't you mean "our purse"?

26:02.061 --> 26:06.065
Yeah, they may be from the same
planet, but it's not Earth.

26:09.669 --> 26:10.903
We're out of the bison,
so we're changing

26:11.003 --> 26:12.271
the Chop of the Day to elk.

26:12.371 --> 26:13.505
If anybody asks, just...

26:22.314 --> 26:24.083
Um, could you excuse me...

26:24.183 --> 26:25.484
(chuckles):
for a second?

26:25.584 --> 26:26.919
(clears throat)

26:28.587 --> 26:32.091
-We're just...
-Ed. There's a drone...

26:32.191 --> 26:33.760
Oh, come on, it's you?

26:33.860 --> 26:35.294
What the hell are you doing?

26:35.394 --> 26:37.630
Nothing much,
just living in the future.

26:39.098 --> 26:42.769
And how did you get Jen
mixed up in all of this?

26:42.869 --> 26:44.837
Mr. Alzate asked if I knew
anything about surveillance.

26:44.937 --> 26:46.873
-Mm-hmm.
-I'm from Hong Kong.

26:46.973 --> 26:50.109
The land of eight million
cameras and no crime.

26:50.209 --> 26:51.844
Coincidence?

26:51.944 --> 26:54.513
Well, it's scaring my customers.

26:54.613 --> 26:57.850
Well, you know who doesn't
steal? People who are scared.

26:59.986 --> 27:03.222
We have a female Caucasian
in aisle 17 who appears

27:03.322 --> 27:06.292
to be concealing something
under an oversized jacket.

27:06.392 --> 27:07.526
Give me eyes on that.

27:13.800 --> 27:17.403
False alarm.
Suspect appears to be pregnant.

27:17.503 --> 27:19.305
Disengaging.

27:19.405 --> 27:20.973
You can't do this, Ed.

27:21.073 --> 27:22.408
The store already has something

27:22.508 --> 27:24.410
that hovers over people
and bothers them.

27:24.510 --> 27:26.312
-It's called you.
-Mm-hmm.

27:26.412 --> 27:28.314
What are you so afraid of,
Kristin?

27:28.414 --> 27:32.084
No more free pens
from the hostess desk? Hmm?

27:33.319 --> 27:35.321
Oh, come on.

27:37.824 --> 27:39.358
(The Godfather theme playing
over TV)

27:39.458 --> 27:41.160
Hey, Mr. B.

27:41.260 --> 27:44.330
Oh, is this the, uh,
uh, The Grandfather?

27:44.430 --> 27:45.397
(music stops)

27:45.497 --> 27:48.400
(chuckles)
The Godfather.

27:48.500 --> 27:51.603
Well, um, I'm sorry
to interrupt, but...

27:51.704 --> 27:55.341
uh, Mandy and I had a tiny
disagreement about money.

27:55.441 --> 27:57.343
Because you only have
a tiny amount of money.

27:58.677 --> 28:01.013
Ask Vanessa, she volunteered
to hear this stuff.

28:01.113 --> 28:02.514
W-Well, she's not here.

28:02.614 --> 28:05.251
(sighs)
She's never here.

28:05.351 --> 28:07.519
(imitates Vito Corleone):
That's how she does it.

28:09.121 --> 28:11.690
So, when we linked our accounts,
uh, Mandy got upset

28:11.791 --> 28:14.293
when she saw that I've been
giving to a charity every month.

28:14.393 --> 28:16.262
No, no, no. I love that you give
to charity, but Dad,

28:16.362 --> 28:19.398
this isn't charity, this is
his deadbeat brother Lonny.

28:19.498 --> 28:21.200
Oh, the deadbeat brother.

28:21.300 --> 28:24.270
Every family has their Fredo.

28:25.537 --> 28:28.640
Dad, we're not talking
about Lord of the Rings.

28:30.709 --> 28:32.478
We're talking about a bully
who-who pushed him around

28:32.578 --> 28:34.280
-since he was little.
-Your mom and I

28:34.380 --> 28:36.382
used to have the same issue
with your Aunt April, right?

28:36.482 --> 28:39.118
She kept asking for money, we
eventually had to cut her off.

28:39.218 --> 28:41.320
But Lonny needs my help
and I can help him.

28:41.420 --> 28:44.323
If I don't... doesn't that
make me a bad person?

28:44.423 --> 28:47.326
It's easy to confuse wanting
to help and needing to help.

28:47.426 --> 28:50.229
What he probably needs
is you to get out of the way,

28:50.329 --> 28:54.300
so he has the dignity to stand
on his own two feet.

28:54.400 --> 28:56.668
And with that, my advice

28:56.769 --> 28:59.005
(imitates Vito Corleone):
is over.

28:59.105 --> 29:01.173
All right, well,
hope you're right, Mr. B.

29:01.273 --> 29:03.009
Of course he's right.

29:03.109 --> 29:05.311
He always gives
such great advice.

29:07.179 --> 29:08.580
(The Godfather theme playing
over TV)

29:08.680 --> 29:11.117
(sighs)

29:11.217 --> 29:13.352
When am I gonna learn?

29:15.754 --> 29:19.758
You give them good advice,
they come back.

29:26.765 --> 29:28.700
I've just had it,
this is so stupid.

29:28.801 --> 29:30.769
Marmaduke again?

29:33.439 --> 29:36.208
They've had this slobbering
Great Dane since 1954,

29:36.308 --> 29:38.878
they still leave a steak
on the table.

29:40.880 --> 29:43.782
Hey. Uh, I'm headed out
to read to the blind

29:43.883 --> 29:45.952
and then serve some soup
at the homeless shelter.

29:46.052 --> 29:48.687
That's great. A lot of guys
use that story as an excuse

29:48.787 --> 29:50.122
to go drink at the bar.

29:50.222 --> 29:52.191
-(laughs)
-Really?

29:52.291 --> 29:55.294
No. I... No.

29:56.728 --> 29:59.498
I-I've read to the blind.

29:59.598 --> 30:02.001
Oh, uh, my brother asked
for more money,

30:02.101 --> 30:04.070
and I said I got some great
advice from my father-in-law,

30:04.170 --> 30:07.739
and that the Kyle Anderson
piggy bank is closed.

30:07.840 --> 30:09.408
What-- uh, hold on. Uh...

30:09.508 --> 30:11.878
Mike told you to stop
helping out your own brother?

30:11.978 --> 30:13.880
Yeah. So I'm volunteering.

30:13.980 --> 30:17.216
If I can't help Lonny,
I got to help somebody.

30:17.316 --> 30:19.651
Well, off to skid row!

30:23.389 --> 30:26.926
Poor Kyle.
Poor, poor heartbroken Kyle.

30:27.026 --> 30:30.329
Stop it. Cutting off his brother
was the right thing to do.

30:30.429 --> 30:32.564
Look, it's not that easy
for some of us, Mike.

30:32.664 --> 30:34.266
Even though your head knows
it's the right thing,

30:34.366 --> 30:36.903
in your heart, it's hard
to say no to family.

30:37.003 --> 30:38.204
Your heart doesn't
know anything.

30:38.304 --> 30:40.406
That's why it's not
called the brain.

30:40.506 --> 30:42.774
This is just like my thing
with my sister April.

30:42.875 --> 30:44.676
We're not gonna get into this
again, are we?

30:44.776 --> 30:47.880
No, no. You specifically
asked me not to talk about it.

30:47.980 --> 30:52.084
Perfect. Yeah, yeah.

30:52.184 --> 30:53.785
Mm.

30:53.886 --> 30:56.788
But you're okay with not
giving her money, right?

30:56.889 --> 30:59.025
What do you mean?
I still send her money.

31:01.860 --> 31:03.029
You know that.

31:03.129 --> 31:05.364
-No, I don't.
-Yes, you do.

31:05.464 --> 31:06.698
Just 'cause you say
I know something doesn't

31:06.798 --> 31:08.400
-make me know it.
-Oh, look.

31:08.500 --> 31:11.203
Last time we had
this conversation,

31:11.303 --> 31:13.572
you distinctly said
you understood

31:13.672 --> 31:15.908
how I feel about April, but you
didn't want to hear about me

31:16.008 --> 31:17.309
giving her any more money.

31:17.409 --> 31:18.477
-Exactly.
-Right, so I send her money,

31:18.577 --> 31:20.746
and you don't hear about it.

31:20.846 --> 31:23.882
Wow. Exactly wrong.

31:23.983 --> 31:26.452
Y-You can tell
what comic strip I'm reading

31:26.552 --> 31:29.121
from across the room, but you
don't understand what I meant

31:29.221 --> 31:31.290
when I said,
"I don't want to hear about it"?

31:31.390 --> 31:33.325
All right, well, if--
well, if that's what you meant,

31:33.425 --> 31:36.228
I didn't agree with it,
and I don't agree with it now.

31:36.328 --> 31:38.097
So I have no say
in how we spend our money.

31:38.197 --> 31:39.831
Look, it's my sister, Mike.
I'm not gonna stop

31:39.932 --> 31:41.667
-giving her money.
-Okay, you know
what I just heard?

31:41.767 --> 31:44.736
"Hey, look, Mike, I'm not gonna
give her any more money!"

31:44.836 --> 31:48.574
Two can play this game.
Ah, la, la, la, la, la!

31:51.243 --> 31:54.080
There she is. The commander
of eye in the sky.

31:54.180 --> 31:56.082
What are we looking at today?
Huh?

31:56.182 --> 31:59.151
Uh, we have a temporary
shutdown, sir.

31:59.251 --> 32:01.353
Huh? What? Where's my drone?

32:01.453 --> 32:03.589
Why aren't I seeing
anything here?

32:03.689 --> 32:05.824
There was... an incident.

32:05.924 --> 32:07.593
Play it back.

32:07.693 --> 32:10.429
-You're not gonna like it.
-All right. Okay.

32:14.933 --> 32:17.169
What's she doing?
What-What's going on?

32:19.938 --> 32:21.507
Told you you wouldn't like it.

32:21.607 --> 32:23.275
(moans)

32:27.446 --> 32:28.947
Oops.

32:33.485 --> 32:35.154
What's this?

32:35.254 --> 32:36.955
It's a peace offering.

32:37.056 --> 32:39.691
That's very nice of you.

32:39.791 --> 32:41.860
You take a bite first.

32:41.960 --> 32:44.130
I didn't do anything
to it, Mike.

32:44.230 --> 32:45.964
Mm-hmm.

32:46.065 --> 32:48.467
(gasps)
Oh!

32:48.567 --> 32:49.701
-(groaning)
-Okay.

32:49.801 --> 32:51.037
Yeah, okay, that-that's nice.

32:51.137 --> 32:53.405
Either die or give me
the cake back.

32:57.209 --> 33:00.812
Honey, I am sorry for
our misunderstanding.

33:00.912 --> 33:04.083
Okay, I would never do anything
deliberately behind your back.

33:04.183 --> 33:07.253
Except that face I make
to the kids.

33:07.353 --> 33:10.256
I guess I could have been
more clear.

33:10.356 --> 33:14.993
-(chuckles)
-Although I really
don't know how.

33:15.094 --> 33:18.164
Look, I know you think that
April is taking advantage of me.

33:18.264 --> 33:20.432
Listen, I know April.

33:20.532 --> 33:22.268
There's nothing that's
enough for her, right?

33:22.368 --> 33:24.002
She's like
a freeloading socialist,

33:24.103 --> 33:26.838
and you're a-a sweet old
Bernie Sanders.

33:26.938 --> 33:28.074
Oh, well, thank you.

33:28.174 --> 33:30.509
"Old" and "Bernie Sanders"
in one sentence.

33:30.609 --> 33:32.678
Look, I'm not saying you're
a lunatic leftist,

33:32.778 --> 33:35.681
-I'm saying you're acting
like a lunatic leftist.
-No, look,

33:35.781 --> 33:37.183
you don't know April.

33:37.283 --> 33:39.851
Okay, she's-she's not some
freeloading socialist.

33:39.951 --> 33:42.454
She's my sister,
and we-we have the same mother.

33:42.554 --> 33:44.690
Wow, you really are a scientist.

33:44.790 --> 33:47.193
Mom wasn't the easiest
person to-to live with,

33:47.293 --> 33:49.861
and April and I were
always there for each other.

33:49.961 --> 33:52.764
And I-I can't say no to her now
when she needs my help.

33:52.864 --> 33:54.966
Do you really think
this is helping her?

33:55.067 --> 33:56.102
Well, I-- maybe not.

33:56.202 --> 33:57.536
I don't know, maybe not.

33:57.636 --> 33:59.738
But I can't look
at somebody I love,

33:59.838 --> 34:01.707
who's desperate,
and-and turn them away.

34:01.807 --> 34:03.209
And I don't think
you could either.

34:03.309 --> 34:04.943
Sure I could.
Give me her phone number.

34:05.043 --> 34:08.147
-No, no, I can't do that.
-And why not?

34:08.247 --> 34:11.383
She lost her phone again, and
I have to send her a new one.

34:11.483 --> 34:13.985
Look. Hey, hey,
that doesn't make you right.

34:15.921 --> 34:17.889
(quietly):
Doesn't make me wrong either.

34:18.990 --> 34:20.292
LONNY:
Hello?

34:20.392 --> 34:22.561
Hello?

34:24.830 --> 34:26.064
Can I help you?

34:26.165 --> 34:27.799
Are you Mike Baxter?

34:27.899 --> 34:29.968
Do you live around here?

34:30.068 --> 34:35.006
No. I'm Kyle's brother, Lonny.
Lonny Anderson.

34:35.107 --> 34:37.476
Wow.

34:37.576 --> 34:40.011
You know, that, uh, poster I had
in my college dorm

34:40.112 --> 34:42.314
was way off.

34:49.521 --> 34:51.089
When Kyle said you were
his big brother,

34:51.190 --> 34:53.692
he wasn't kidding.

34:53.792 --> 34:56.495
Yeah, people always said
I got the muscles,

34:56.595 --> 34:58.764
he got the brains.

34:58.864 --> 35:01.032
Wow.

35:01.133 --> 35:03.001
Well, it's a good thing
you-you both have

35:03.101 --> 35:06.538
that nonviolent personality,
right? Right?

35:06.638 --> 35:08.707
I'm not here
looking for trouble.

35:08.807 --> 35:11.210
I just want to know why
you told him to cut me off.

35:11.310 --> 35:12.844
I'm family.

35:12.944 --> 35:14.012
That's not exactly
what I told Kyle.

35:14.112 --> 35:17.048
Look, he's starting
a new family right now.

35:17.149 --> 35:20.051
It-it might be a good time
for you to pull your own weight.

35:20.152 --> 35:21.620
Right?
And speaking of weight,

35:21.720 --> 35:25.023
what do you bench, like, 300?

35:25.123 --> 35:29.561
I don't know exactly.
Whatever a motorcycle weighs.

35:29.661 --> 35:32.298
Look, the way I understand it,
Kyle's been supporting you

35:32.398 --> 35:33.965
for a long time, you know?

35:34.065 --> 35:35.867
But look, the economy's great.

35:35.967 --> 35:37.636
There's jobs everywhere
right now.

35:37.736 --> 35:39.571
You think I'm a bum, don't you?

35:39.671 --> 35:40.972
No, no, no, no.
I think you're used to

35:41.072 --> 35:43.742
taking money from your brother,

35:43.842 --> 35:45.811
which might be getting
in the way

35:45.911 --> 35:48.013
of you making it on your own.

35:48.113 --> 35:49.915
I've had a ton of jobs, okay?

35:50.015 --> 35:52.083
Getting them's easy.
Keeping them's hard.

35:52.184 --> 35:55.086
Yeah. And yet, I've had one
for 30 years,

35:55.187 --> 35:57.088
but, you know, go on.

35:57.189 --> 36:00.892
I'm not gonna let some jackass
making 50 cents an hour

36:00.992 --> 36:02.861
more than I do yell at me.

36:02.961 --> 36:05.897
I grew up getting screamed at.

36:05.997 --> 36:08.099
Kyle told me a lot about
how you guys grew up,

36:08.200 --> 36:11.437
and I know, I know your mom
was a-a handful.

36:11.537 --> 36:13.339
She was nuts.

36:14.873 --> 36:18.076
My old man, he was worse.

36:18.176 --> 36:23.849
Well, I-I don't ever recall
Kyle complaining about your dad.

36:23.949 --> 36:27.018
Kyle was born after he left.

36:27.118 --> 36:28.687
He was the lucky one.

36:28.787 --> 36:32.291
The rest of us, we had to
sit there and take it.

36:34.460 --> 36:37.696
Sometimes our parents cast
a long shadow, don't they?

36:37.796 --> 36:41.132
Listen, maybe there's something
down at Outdoor Man.

36:41.233 --> 36:43.034
You know, we might have
some work at the loading dock,

36:43.134 --> 36:45.471
or, hell, lifting boats.
(chuckles)

36:45.571 --> 36:48.374
Nah, I don't want to work there.

36:48.474 --> 36:50.709
I mean, that's all I need
is everybody comparing me

36:50.809 --> 36:52.944
to my super smart brother.

36:53.044 --> 36:55.213
(chuckles):
Yeah.

36:55.314 --> 37:00.252
Well, um, look, I-I know
a lot of people in Denver.

37:00.352 --> 37:01.820
I'll make some calls, all right?

37:01.920 --> 37:04.890
Thanks, but no.

37:04.990 --> 37:07.326
You know, maybe you were
right before.

37:07.426 --> 37:09.160
I mean, this could be
a good time for me

37:09.261 --> 37:10.962
to make a new start.

37:11.062 --> 37:12.398
I got a buddy up in Wyoming

37:12.498 --> 37:14.300
who's been bugging me
to come up there.

37:14.400 --> 37:15.767
Wyoming's a great place, man.

37:15.867 --> 37:17.769
Good opportunity that could
turn into something great.

37:17.869 --> 37:19.271
He's in a biker gang.

37:19.371 --> 37:21.840
Or it might not.

37:21.940 --> 37:26.144
Look, I'm really happy that
Kyle has a family now.

37:26.244 --> 37:27.245
He's a good kid.

37:27.346 --> 37:29.348
He's a great man.

37:29.448 --> 37:31.149
And you're okay, too.

37:31.249 --> 37:32.751
It's funny, you know.

37:32.851 --> 37:34.986
You're not at all
who I thought you were.

37:35.086 --> 37:36.955
You either.

37:37.055 --> 37:38.790
I'll tell him you stopped by.

37:43.595 --> 37:45.096
Okay.

37:45.196 --> 37:46.532
Sorry again about the drone, Ed.

37:46.632 --> 37:50.602
No apology necessary.
You did the right thing.

37:50.702 --> 37:51.837
-What was I thinking?
-(chuckles)

37:51.937 --> 37:54.205
I'm just glad that you realized
Chuck's security system

37:54.306 --> 37:56.007
is fine the way it is.

37:56.107 --> 37:57.876
Mm. But it's not.

37:57.976 --> 38:00.712
However, next time
we beef up security,

38:00.812 --> 38:02.348
it won't be with a drone.

38:02.448 --> 38:06.217
It'll be with something
that-that blends in.

38:08.487 --> 38:10.288
Ed?

38:10.389 --> 38:12.891
What do, what do you mean,
"the next time"?

38:14.460 --> 38:16.027
(whirring)

38:16.127 --> 38:19.498
Oh, my God.

38:19.598 --> 38:21.132
Ed, this doesn't blend in!

38:24.503 --> 38:27.305
Hey, babe, uh, I want to talk
about your sister, okay?

38:27.406 --> 38:28.707
You have anything new to say?

38:28.807 --> 38:31.643
I still think it's a bad idea
for you to give her money.

38:31.743 --> 38:34.346
(scoffs)
I am underwhelmed.

38:34.446 --> 38:36.648
-Hey there.
-Hi, guys.

38:36.748 --> 38:38.550
Boy, you learn stuff
when you're helping people.

38:38.650 --> 38:40.419
Today I learned that
you don't have to talk louder

38:40.519 --> 38:42.320
when you read to the blind.

38:44.155 --> 38:46.191
And I learned that when
you mispronounce a word,

38:46.291 --> 38:48.494
even the blind will
roll their eyes.

38:52.330 --> 38:54.099
All right, well,
I'm gonna go lay down.

38:54.199 --> 38:57.002
I just spent two hours
shouting The Da Vinci Code.

38:59.170 --> 39:00.739
I feel so bad for Kyle.

39:00.839 --> 39:02.374
He keeps beating himself up
about Lonny,

39:02.474 --> 39:04.676
and I-I wish there was something
I could do to help.

39:04.776 --> 39:06.612
Well, as luck would have it,
your mom and I are dealing

39:06.712 --> 39:09.381
with a similar situation
with, uh, your Aunt April,

39:09.481 --> 39:11.249
so I'd like to field this,
if I could.

39:11.349 --> 39:13.885
Yeah, this should be
interesting; I'm all ears.

39:13.985 --> 39:16.522
Eh, mostly teeth and hair,
but whatever.

39:18.524 --> 39:21.593
I realized that
I don't really know April.

39:21.693 --> 39:24.295
-At least not the way
your mom knows her.
-No.

39:24.396 --> 39:27.566
But I know your mom,
and I trust her.

39:27.666 --> 39:31.770
Okay, starting to be
a little "whelmed."

39:31.870 --> 39:34.540
And if she thinks that
helping her sister

39:34.640 --> 39:36.408
with our money is a good idea,

39:36.508 --> 39:38.043
I trust her that
it's a good idea.

39:38.143 --> 39:39.277
Case closed.

39:39.377 --> 39:41.613
Thank you.

39:41.713 --> 39:43.649
Okay, so that's what
I should do with Kyle.

39:43.749 --> 39:45.417
No, no, no,
you just can't copy us.

39:45.517 --> 39:48.319
Every relationship is different.
It's like a classic car, right?

39:48.420 --> 39:49.921
Right, right, right. You said
that at Chuck's wedding.

39:50.021 --> 39:52.724
-Exactly.
-Just before Kyle
called Mom fat.

39:54.760 --> 39:56.995
Uh, look, I-I know
I don't say this

39:57.095 --> 39:59.397
as much as your father does,
but he's right.

40:02.233 --> 40:05.236
Money issues are too personal
for you to copy

40:05.336 --> 40:06.972
-what anybody else does.
-Right.

40:07.072 --> 40:09.274
Like a classic car.
Every marriage is different

40:09.374 --> 40:10.776
and requires a different
amount of work.

40:10.876 --> 40:12.110
You know,
sometimes it's the valves,

40:12.210 --> 40:13.512
sometimes the carburetor,
that sort of thing.

40:13.612 --> 40:14.913
-I understand.
-Okay.

40:15.013 --> 40:17.315
What if our car's electric?

40:19.284 --> 40:22.488
Then I don't really want
to talk to you.

40:25.090 --> 40:26.825
Okay, great advice, Dad.

40:26.925 --> 40:29.761
And since The Godfather's
your favorite movie...

40:29.861 --> 40:31.763
(imitates the Terminator):
I'll be back.

40:33.098 --> 40:34.099
(chuckles)

40:40.438 --> 40:43.008
-Thank you, Mike.
-Mm. Come here.

40:43.108 --> 40:44.776
-Mm...
-What?

40:44.876 --> 40:49.280
Ugh, I just can't stop picturing
Trump and Pelosi in the bath.

40:57.322 --> 40:59.390
Hey, Mike Baxter here
for Outdoor Man,

40:59.491 --> 41:01.960
inviting you to come on down
and spend your money.

41:02.060 --> 41:03.629
You can spend a little or a lot.

41:03.729 --> 41:06.364
Hell, you can spend it all.

41:06.464 --> 41:10.035
And I'm just gonna say
thank you.

41:10.135 --> 41:12.804
(chuckles)
Because we're not married.

41:12.904 --> 41:14.740
You don't need my permission
to buy a boat,

41:14.840 --> 41:19.645
but if you feel like you do,
trust me... buy the boat.

41:19.745 --> 41:23.481
Between business and customers,
money is just about numbers.

41:23.582 --> 41:25.984
But in a marriage, money is
an emotional minefield.

41:26.084 --> 41:27.218
One wrong step and boom!

41:27.318 --> 41:30.021
It'll cost you
an arm and a leg.

41:30.121 --> 41:31.923
How we spend our money
is an expression

41:32.023 --> 41:33.258
of what we care about.

41:33.358 --> 41:35.827
The book of Matthew says,
"Where your treasure is,

41:35.927 --> 41:38.530
there your heart will be also."

41:38.630 --> 41:40.599
Spend two months' salary
on an engagement ring,

41:40.699 --> 41:42.200
and your fiancée will love you.

41:42.300 --> 41:45.403
Spend two months' salary
on a Nitro Z bass boat

41:45.503 --> 41:48.239
without permission, you might be
sleeping in that boat.

41:50.375 --> 41:52.744
But with the right sleeping bag,
it isn't that uncomfortable,

41:52.844 --> 41:55.714
to be honest with you.

41:55.814 --> 41:58.216
A purchase might have
some deeper meaning to some.

41:58.316 --> 42:00.786
Maybe your partner doesn't see
Broncos season tickets

42:00.886 --> 42:02.420
and wonder if they're
too expensive,

42:02.520 --> 42:04.422
but instead wonders
if you love football

42:04.522 --> 42:05.957
more than you love her.

42:06.057 --> 42:07.292
And, of course,
the answer to that is

42:07.392 --> 42:09.728
not since
Peyton Manning retired.

42:11.529 --> 42:13.732
Therapists tell us
arguments about money

42:13.832 --> 42:17.368
can often be on something
unfulfilled from our childhood.

42:17.468 --> 42:20.238
I feel it, and I get it.

42:20.338 --> 42:22.608
And just maybe
what you didn't get

42:22.708 --> 42:25.310
when you were a kid could be,
I don't know,

42:25.410 --> 42:28.113
a bow and arrow,
a cool camp stove,

42:28.213 --> 42:30.315
or a snowmobile.

42:32.550 --> 42:35.386
Where could you possibly
find stuff like that?

42:37.889 --> 42:39.725
As luck would have it,
I bet we carry it

42:39.825 --> 42:41.459
right here at Outdoor Man.

42:41.559 --> 42:42.761
And it might be on sale.

42:42.861 --> 42:46.665
(chuckles):
Look, I do what I can to help.

42:46.765 --> 42:48.934
Baxter out.

42:49.968 --> 42:51.502
(chicken clucks)

42:51.603 --> 42:53.538
