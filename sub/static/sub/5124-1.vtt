00:31.073 --> 00:34.952
All right, Coop.
A hundred and five degrees.

00:34.993 --> 00:39.581
- What do you say?
- 105? I can go more.

00:39.665 --> 00:43.794
- 107.

00:44.628 --> 00:48.298
- 108.
- I'm feeling it.

00:48.382 --> 00:50.092
109.

00:50.133 --> 00:52.469
OK, the suspense is killing me.

00:52.553 --> 00:53.971
- All right, 110.
- 110?

00:54.012 --> 00:57.099
- 110.
- A hundred and ten toasty ones.

00:57.140 --> 00:59.226
Right. Ready to go out
and greet the heat?

00:59.309 --> 01:00.853
The warm wind in my hair?

01:00.936 --> 01:02.312
- Are you ready?
- I'm ready.

01:02.396 --> 01:04.438
- Let's do it.
- Let's do it.

01:17.160 --> 01:18.954
Thirty-one. Thirty-one degrees.

01:18.996 --> 01:22.124
- Thirty-one below.
- Thirty-one below! New record!

01:22.207 --> 01:24.293
- Thirty-one below!
- New record!

01:24.376 --> 01:27.588
New record! Oh, it's cold!

02:43.580 --> 02:45.374
I hate to do this, but...

02:45.457 --> 02:47.709
Rise and shine, kids.
No more sleeping in.

02:52.506 --> 02:55.592
All right.
If "rise and shine" won't work...

02:55.676 --> 02:57.386
Is anybody hungry this morning?

02:57.427 --> 03:01.014
Attaboy, Max.

03:02.432 --> 03:05.185
Hey, what do you say?
Ready for exercise before breakfast?

03:06.436 --> 03:08.730
How you doing?

03:08.772 --> 03:10.190
How does right field look?

03:11.108 --> 03:14.778
I think it looks pretty good.
What do you say, Max? Here we go.

03:14.862 --> 03:16.905
Go get it!

03:20.909 --> 03:23.161
Hey, Maya.

03:23.245 --> 03:26.206
How's my best girl doing, huh?

03:26.290 --> 03:28.250
How you doing?

03:28.333 --> 03:30.043
You keeping everybody in line?

03:31.420 --> 03:34.173
Left field. Go get it.

03:34.256 --> 03:36.341
Left field, Maya. Here we go.

03:37.718 --> 03:40.262
Go get it!

03:41.930 --> 03:43.724
Attaboy, Max. Come here, buddy.

03:51.273 --> 03:54.151
Settle down.
There's plenty to go around, guys.

03:54.234 --> 03:55.694
Here you go, Shorty.

03:56.904 --> 03:58.322
Good boy, Shadow.

03:58.405 --> 04:01.825
Dewey. Truman.

04:01.909 --> 04:03.160
There you go, Old Jack.

04:18.634 --> 04:21.720
That's my best girl.
Here, I'll trade you.

04:21.803 --> 04:22.804
There you go, Maya.

04:37.819 --> 04:40.155
- Hi.
- Hey.

04:40.197 --> 04:43.283
- Didn't think I'd see you this year.
- Guess you got lucky.

04:43.367 --> 04:44.826
- I guess so.
- Crazy Katie!

04:44.910 --> 04:48.872
- Did you get your pilot's license yet?
- Oh, Coop, I missed you.

04:48.914 --> 04:52.376
OK.

04:54.044 --> 04:56.547
- Got that?
- Yeah.

04:56.630 --> 04:58.423
Hey, hey, careful with that.

04:58.507 --> 05:02.177
That equipment's made it 10,000 miles.
I'd hate that to change in six feet.

05:02.219 --> 05:04.012
Sorry about that.

05:04.054 --> 05:06.557
Hi. I'm Dr. Davis McClaren.

05:06.640 --> 05:08.642
Earth and Space Sciences UCLA.

05:08.725 --> 05:12.938
Jerry Shepard, expedition guide.
Welcome to the bottom of the world.

05:13.021 --> 05:14.523
- Nice to meet you.
- Same here.

05:14.606 --> 05:17.734
Go any further south,
you'll fall off the planet.

05:17.818 --> 05:20.112
Well, that'd be unfortunate.

05:20.195 --> 05:24.032
Charlie Cooper, cartographer,
mechanical engineer, runway paver.

05:24.074 --> 05:27.035
- Nice to meet you.
- Dr. McClaren! Welcome to the ice.

05:27.077 --> 05:30.539
Andy Harrison, NSF science director.
An honor to meet you.

05:30.581 --> 05:33.458
- Dr. Rosemary Paris, field coordinator.
- Nice to meet you.

05:33.542 --> 05:34.918
You've met our team?

05:34.960 --> 05:38.172
Yeah, Mr. Cooper was just taking
good care of all my things.

05:38.255 --> 05:41.008
Cooper, really?
First time for everything, I suppose.

05:41.091 --> 05:42.801
- Let's get you inside.
- Thanks.

05:42.885 --> 05:46.096
- Sure.
- Yeah.

05:49.433 --> 05:52.019
OK. Lady luck, in my corner.

05:52.102 --> 05:54.771
-What are we playing?
- She is pretty.

05:54.855 --> 05:57.399
- Quarter in.
- Quarter.

05:57.441 --> 06:00.277
- You're going down.
- You're going down.

06:00.360 --> 06:02.029
Crazy Katie, you're going down.

06:02.112 --> 06:04.573
- Hey, doc, you want in?
- No, thanks.

06:04.656 --> 06:06.450
I gave up gambling a long time ago.

06:06.533 --> 06:08.827
Hey, you flew in with Katie, didn't you?

06:08.911 --> 06:12.497
- Remind me how you're getting home.

06:14.291 --> 06:16.293
Say, Old Jack, you in or out, buddy?

06:18.462 --> 06:21.173
- Translation?
- That'd be out.

06:22.674 --> 06:25.761
- So, Coop, how's the new girlfriend?
- Mmm.

06:26.970 --> 06:28.972
How's my new girl?

06:29.056 --> 06:30.641
I don't know.

06:30.724 --> 06:33.143
- How about hot?
- Wow.

06:33.685 --> 06:35.604
- Huh?
-  Wow.

06:35.646 --> 06:38.649
She's a scientist too.
At the Italian base.

06:38.690 --> 06:40.150
- Pretty and smart.
- Smarts.

06:40.234 --> 06:42.778
Yeah. Notice something
missing in that picture?

06:42.819 --> 06:46.448
OK, OK. I think...
I know you mean me.

06:46.490 --> 06:50.244
You're talk... The picture's coming.
She's sending one of the two of us, OK?

06:50.327 --> 06:51.453
Patience, Jer.

06:51.495 --> 06:53.872
- Uh-huh. How many?
- Two.

06:53.956 --> 06:56.750
Doc, you looking forward
to your first trip to Dry Valleys?

06:56.834 --> 06:59.586
It's a pretty cool spot
this time of year.

06:59.670 --> 07:02.130
Actually, Dr. McClaren
needs to get to Mt. Melbourne

07:02.172 --> 07:04.341
to search for his meteorite.

07:06.844 --> 07:08.846
Melbourne, huh?

07:08.887 --> 07:10.889
Nobody said anything about Melbourne.

07:10.973 --> 07:13.642
Yeah. Meteorite hunting
is a pretty small world

07:13.725 --> 07:17.229
and, uh, I didn't want anybody
to know where I was really going,

07:17.312 --> 07:19.982
'cause I'm looking
for something special at Melbourne

07:20.023 --> 07:22.734
and the NSF let us
keep it off the paperwork.

07:24.486 --> 07:25.863
Is there a problem?

07:27.030 --> 07:29.533
Look, doc, let me show you something.

07:33.203 --> 07:35.330
I'll show you on the map.

07:36.123 --> 07:38.292
- This is where we are, right? OK.
- Yeah.

07:38.375 --> 07:40.002
Here's Dry Valleys.

07:40.085 --> 07:44.047
All the way over here, Mt. Melbourne.
Twice as far and the opposite direction.

07:44.131 --> 07:46.800
I've been over our route twice
in the last week,

07:46.884 --> 07:50.137
but I haven't been to Mt. Melbourne
since the beginning of the season.

07:50.220 --> 07:53.390
Well, that may be so. But
Dr. McClaren has traveled a long way.

07:53.473 --> 07:56.894
- If we can accommodate him, we should.
- Andy, it's the end of January.

07:56.977 --> 07:59.897
The ice is too thin and snowmobiles
would be too dangerous.

07:59.938 --> 08:03.025
There's only one way
to make that trip, with the dogs.

08:03.066 --> 08:05.152
The dogs?

08:06.403 --> 08:09.698
OK. Will they be able
to carry all my gear?

08:09.740 --> 08:11.783
The dogs'll be fine.

08:11.867 --> 08:14.828
- It's really late in the season.
- Last year we had the dogs out

08:14.912 --> 08:17.372
right up until the day we left.

08:20.542 --> 08:23.921
All right, Andy.
You're the boss. I'll get things ready.

08:26.256 --> 08:30.344
- Hey, you need some help?
- No, I'm fine.

08:30.427 --> 08:31.970
Coop, say good night to Buck.

08:34.014 --> 08:37.142
Uh, I'm gonna take a rain check, Jer.

08:39.019 --> 08:40.812
Ah...

08:40.895 --> 08:42.688
Kids, come on! Let's go!

08:42.773 --> 08:45.901
Everyone outside. Let's get you
tucked into bed. Come on.

08:53.617 --> 08:55.536
Good, Jack.

08:55.619 --> 08:57.788
Good boy. I'll see you in the morning.

09:01.291 --> 09:03.210
Hey, Maya.

09:04.795 --> 09:06.713
What do you say? One more trip, huh?

09:06.797 --> 09:10.175
Then we'll get you to McMurdo
for the winter. That sound good?

09:10.259 --> 09:13.595
Huh? That sound good? That's my girl.

09:15.848 --> 09:19.685
Hey, Max. I need a good trip out of you.

09:23.730 --> 09:26.149
Lucky star, huh? Let's hope so.

09:26.984 --> 09:28.777
See you in the morning, Max.

09:35.868 --> 09:37.119
Knock, knock.

09:37.160 --> 09:38.954
- Hey.
- Hey.

09:38.996 --> 09:41.290
I warmed up some of
your favorite ice cream.

09:41.373 --> 09:43.834
Strawberry.
That's your favorite ice cream.

09:43.876 --> 09:47.462
Yeah, well, you got here early.
I didn't have time to go shopping.

09:49.006 --> 09:52.134
Uh, yeah, well, they changed things up.

09:52.176 --> 09:54.011
How you been?

09:54.094 --> 09:56.096
Been a good season. Kids are doing well.

09:56.180 --> 09:59.725
Maya's been awesome.
Old Jack's getting a bit older, so...

09:59.808 --> 10:02.311
Jerry, I was asking you how you've been.

10:08.066 --> 10:10.110
I'm not interrupting or anything, am I?

10:10.194 --> 10:12.279
No, Rosie. We were just catching up.

10:12.863 --> 10:14.823
OK.

10:17.576 --> 10:20.037
All right, well, uh...

10:20.078 --> 10:22.372
I guess I'll see you guys
in the morning, then.

10:22.456 --> 10:24.041
Thank you. That was sweet.

10:25.501 --> 10:27.669
No problem. Good night.

10:27.753 --> 10:29.713
Good night.

10:40.224 --> 10:42.476
- Pardon me.
- Oh, sorry.

10:42.559 --> 10:44.853
- Oh!

10:46.021 --> 10:48.023
Oh! Head's up.

10:48.857 --> 10:53.028
Sad fact of life in this place, doc.
Floor is more comfy than the bunks.

10:53.111 --> 10:55.822
So, what is it exactly that you do here?

10:55.906 --> 11:00.369
Cartography. I spent the last two years
mapping every inch of this territory.

11:02.079 --> 11:04.414
Hey, dude.
What happened? You strike out?

11:08.085 --> 11:10.212
No. I didn't even swing.

11:10.254 --> 11:14.800
Ah, went down looking.
That's still a strike-out, Jer.

11:16.760 --> 11:19.304
- Ow! Ow!
-Sorry about that, buddy.

11:19.388 --> 11:21.139
I didn't see you there.

11:25.811 --> 11:29.690
We turn the heat off at night, so if
there's anything you need to keep warm,

11:29.773 --> 11:31.400
I suggest you sleep with it.

11:34.236 --> 11:35.362
Incoming.

11:35.445 --> 11:38.156
Ow! Jerry!

11:38.240 --> 11:40.325
- Man!

11:46.582 --> 11:48.417
OK, this is the last of it.

11:53.755 --> 11:56.758
Wow, doc.
Won't be losing you, now, will we?

11:58.969 --> 12:00.762
All right, rule number one.

12:00.846 --> 12:04.641
If you want to approach the dogs,
approach them from the front. OK?

12:04.725 --> 12:06.435
- See how the lines are taut?
- Yeah.

12:06.476 --> 12:09.938
I want them like that at all times.
If the line's tangled, they'll fight.

12:10.022 --> 12:11.773
- We don't want that.
- Got it.

12:11.815 --> 12:14.985
- Anything else I should know?
- The rest is pretty much up to me.

12:15.068 --> 12:17.112
I gotta watch them.
They're working dogs.

12:17.154 --> 12:19.615
They'll run themselves to death.
They love work.

12:19.656 --> 12:22.326
All right, official introductions.

12:22.409 --> 12:25.579
Up here in front, on lead,
we got my best girl, Maya.

12:25.662 --> 12:27.664
Next to her we got Old Jack.

12:27.748 --> 12:31.543
Just turned ten, and, uh, he's
actually getting ready for retirement.

12:31.627 --> 12:34.421
Back here,
the white one, this is Shorty.

12:34.505 --> 12:37.257
And next to him is the pup
of the bunch. That's Max.

12:37.341 --> 12:38.884
He's still in training.

12:38.967 --> 12:41.929
He's got the right stuff.
I expect big things out of him.

12:42.012 --> 12:44.431
Right here, we got the twins.
This is Truman.

12:44.515 --> 12:47.142
Truman took a bite
out of Dewey a couple years ago.

12:47.226 --> 12:49.853
- Notice the scar above Dewey's eye?
- Oh, yeah.

12:49.937 --> 12:53.649
Yeah. Well, they've been
buddies ever since, so...

12:53.732 --> 12:56.693
Back here, last but not least,
we got the two malamutes.

12:56.735 --> 13:00.030
The gray one's Shadow
and the red one's his buddy, Buck.

13:00.113 --> 13:03.242
All brawn and absolutely no brain.
But we love 'em.

13:05.244 --> 13:08.038
- Everyone good to go this morning?
- Yeah, I think so.

13:08.121 --> 13:10.624
I was just being introduced
to Maya, Old Jack,

13:10.707 --> 13:13.293
Shorty, Max, Truman,
Dewey, Shadow and Buck.

13:13.377 --> 13:15.337
- Excellent.
- Jer?

13:16.547 --> 13:20.008
- Be careful out there, OK?
- Always.

13:20.050 --> 13:21.593
Take care of Cooper for me.

13:21.677 --> 13:24.137
Don't worry. I'll give him
plenty of food and water.

13:24.221 --> 13:25.722
OK, enough. Are we done?

13:25.806 --> 13:29.977
I'd like a picture of our
intrepid explorers, please. Thank you.

13:30.060 --> 13:32.312
- All right. Hang on!

13:32.396 --> 13:33.981
OK.

13:34.064 --> 13:35.023
OK, you ready?

13:36.775 --> 13:39.403
Uno, dos, tres.

13:39.486 --> 13:42.531
- Handsome. So handsome.

13:43.240 --> 13:46.285
Hey, Coop. You'd better get up here
and say goodbye to Buck.

13:49.288 --> 13:51.540
Oh, yeah?

13:51.623 --> 13:54.293
All right, uh, see you, Buck!

13:54.376 --> 13:56.336
Safe... Safe trip, Buck.

13:56.420 --> 13:59.506
No. Come over and say goodbye.
You're gonna give him a complex.

14:03.051 --> 14:05.220
And what about my complex?

14:05.262 --> 14:07.556
Come around... Come say goodbye to him.

14:09.725 --> 14:13.270
I'm... I'm pretty sure he heard me
say goodbye, Jer. I don't...

14:14.438 --> 14:16.857
OK. I don't know why you do this.

14:18.358 --> 14:20.569
- OK.

14:21.904 --> 14:23.488
See ya, Buck.

14:23.572 --> 14:25.616
All right. You, uh...

14:25.699 --> 14:29.828
You take care of the doctor
and, uh, Jerry, OK?

14:29.912 --> 14:33.957
- Oh! Oh! Nasty!

14:34.041 --> 14:35.459
Oh! That was disgusting!

14:35.542 --> 14:38.754
I got dog spit all in my mouth
and my nose!

14:39.755 --> 14:42.090
It's not funny.

14:44.301 --> 14:47.095
I don't see what's so funny.

14:47.721 --> 14:50.724
All right.
Take care, guys. We'll see you.

14:50.807 --> 14:52.309
- Bye.
- See ya.

14:52.392 --> 14:55.229
All right, team!
Last hike of the season!

14:55.312 --> 14:56.813
Let's go! Hike! Hike!

15:27.177 --> 15:29.429
Come on, Jack! Come on, Old Jack!

15:29.513 --> 15:31.890
Let's go, Maya! Come on, girl!

16:03.881 --> 16:06.466
Whoa! Whoa!

16:10.053 --> 16:12.681
Whoa! Whoa!

16:18.687 --> 16:20.230
What's the problem?

16:20.314 --> 16:24.276
We got ice fields up ahead.
I don't know how thick the ice is.

16:24.359 --> 16:26.987
That's why we couldn't take
the snowmobiles. Look.

16:27.070 --> 16:28.906
So, what do we do?

16:30.157 --> 16:32.034
I'm gonna change things up.

16:32.075 --> 16:34.494
Put the dogs
in a fan formation for safety.

16:34.578 --> 16:37.873
It's a little slower,
but it spreads the weight out.

16:37.915 --> 16:40.292
That way if one of the dogs
falls through the ice,

16:40.375 --> 16:44.379
the lead's long enough
so the rest don't follow.

16:44.421 --> 16:47.633
Hike!

17:17.037 --> 17:19.248
Hey, doc.

17:19.289 --> 17:21.959
- You see that over there?
- What is that?

17:23.417 --> 17:25.503
Here.

17:28.048 --> 17:29.842
You see 'em?

17:29.925 --> 17:32.594
I see 'em. What are they?
- Leopard seals.

17:32.636 --> 17:34.888
More leopard than seal, if you ask me.

17:34.972 --> 17:37.599
- Give 'em a wide birth?
- Yeah, we'll give 'em some space.

17:57.452 --> 18:00.581
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

18:00.664 --> 18:02.916
Whoa, kids! Whoa!

18:03.917 --> 18:06.503
- What was that?
- We're on a glacier now.

18:06.587 --> 18:08.964
We're gonna have to
take her slow, doc. Get off.

18:09.006 --> 18:13.051
I want you to take the brake.
You're gonna run the sled. All right?

18:13.135 --> 18:14.970
Heavy brake.

18:15.053 --> 18:17.723
Follow my footprints.
Keep the sled on my footprints.

18:17.806 --> 18:19.141
- I'll probe ahead.
- Got it.

18:19.183 --> 18:22.603
This glacier's always moving,
so we have to be careful.

18:27.649 --> 18:30.986
All right, doc. Keep two feet
on the brake if you need to.

18:31.069 --> 18:34.156
- Just keep a steady go, all right?
- All right.

18:34.239 --> 18:36.909
All right, kids, come on! Easy, now!

18:36.992 --> 18:39.369
Nice and easy. Let's go.

19:00.307 --> 19:02.392
All right, stop! Stop!

19:02.476 --> 19:04.853
All right, hard brake, right there!

19:07.147 --> 19:09.149
We got a crevasse right here.

19:09.233 --> 19:13.320
I'm not sure how big it is,
so we're gonna go around. OK.

19:13.403 --> 19:16.740
We're gonna bring it over this way.
Slow and easy.

19:16.823 --> 19:18.492
I'm gonna call Maya over,

19:18.575 --> 19:21.828
and then I just want you
to let up ever so lightly, all right?

19:21.912 --> 19:25.123
- All right, got it.
- All right, Maya, haw! Haw!

19:28.293 --> 19:30.963
Haw! Haw!

19:31.046 --> 19:32.506
Max, what are you doing?

19:33.590 --> 19:34.675
Max, no. Haw!

19:35.759 --> 19:38.220
Max! Stop! Stop, Max! Doc, stop!

19:40.597 --> 19:42.975
No!

19:48.272 --> 19:50.399
- Hold on, doc!

19:52.025 --> 19:55.070
Doc! Put both hands on the sled!
Both hands on the sled, doc!

19:58.073 --> 20:01.410
Hike! Come on, Jack, take it home!

20:01.451 --> 20:02.870
Come on, Maya, take her home!

20:05.747 --> 20:06.874
Come on! Hike!

20:25.392 --> 20:27.269
Oh, man!

20:27.311 --> 20:28.437
You OK?

20:28.478 --> 20:31.398
Yeah.

20:41.992 --> 20:43.619
Do me a favor.

20:43.702 --> 20:48.081
Next time you decide to go to Melbourne,
don't pack so much stuff.

20:48.165 --> 20:50.542
And try coming a bit earlier.

20:50.626 --> 20:53.170
Andy said the trip was fine.
You agreed to go.

20:57.341 --> 21:00.135
Andy's my boss. I do what he says.

21:00.177 --> 21:03.722
If you didn't think it was safe,
you shouldn't have backed down.

21:19.321 --> 21:22.449
- Easy.

21:28.705 --> 21:30.832
Jerry, thanks for today.

21:31.458 --> 21:35.087
Yeah. No problem.

21:40.926 --> 21:43.178
Who's the artist?

21:43.220 --> 21:46.181
My son, Eric.

21:47.558 --> 21:49.685
He does one every trip.

21:53.063 --> 21:55.190
He looks like your wife.

21:55.232 --> 21:57.693
Lucky kid.

22:00.529 --> 22:02.364
Yeah.

22:02.447 --> 22:04.908
What about you? You got somebody?

22:04.950 --> 22:06.076
Are you kidding me?

22:06.159 --> 22:09.413
I'm here six months a year
dragging scientists around.

22:09.496 --> 22:11.707
What kind of woman
would put up with that?

22:11.790 --> 22:14.793
How about Katie?
Looked like you might've had something.

22:14.877 --> 22:19.047
Yeah. A couple years ago we did.

22:19.131 --> 22:22.426
You know how it goes. Sometimes
it works, sometimes it doesn't.

22:22.509 --> 22:25.179
I guess relationships
don't fit my lifestyle.

22:27.598 --> 22:29.725
Anyhow, come on. Let's go outside, guys.

22:29.808 --> 22:33.395
We're gonna get an early start tomorrow.
Come on.Come on, Max.

22:33.437 --> 22:35.814
Come on, Max.

22:59.880 --> 23:01.423
All right, whoa!

23:01.507 --> 23:04.259
Doc, hold it. Put on the brake,
I'm gonna take it from here.

23:04.343 --> 23:07.471
Yeah, got it. Whoa!

23:10.057 --> 23:12.059
What do you say?

23:12.142 --> 23:14.937
- That's something else.
- That's Melbourne.

23:15.938 --> 23:19.983
- That's your home for the next week.
- Beautiful.

23:20.067 --> 23:22.194
Ready, now! Hike!

23:35.332 --> 23:40.087
Victoria,this is McMurdo Weather. Come in.

23:40.170 --> 23:43.215
Victoria? This is McMurdo Weather.

23:43.298 --> 23:45.676
This is Victoria. We copy you, Mactown.

23:45.759 --> 23:49.555
Hi, Andy. It's Steve.Just checking status on your team.

23:49.638 --> 23:52.307
We've got four at the base
and two in the field. Over.

23:52.349 --> 23:54.268
Suggest you bring them in.

23:54.351 --> 23:57.145
We have two massive low pressure systems moving south.

23:57.187 --> 24:00.816
Control wants you in early
just to be safe. Over.

24:00.899 --> 24:02.943
Copy that, Mactown. Over and out.

24:03.026 --> 24:05.195
Get Jerry on the radio.

24:16.874 --> 24:19.168
Wanna sling me a cup of that
when you get a chance?

24:19.251 --> 24:21.211
Yeah, sure thing.

24:27.551 --> 24:29.720
- You got her?
- Yeah, thanks.

24:33.056 --> 24:34.641
How's that looking there?

24:34.725 --> 24:37.978
Well, everything points
to the spot that we're on.

24:38.061 --> 24:41.523
The next couple days
are gonna tell us a lot.

24:41.607 --> 24:44.693
Field base to Melbourne. Come in.

24:44.735 --> 24:47.362
Base to Melbourne. Come in.

24:49.239 --> 24:50.532
Jerry?

24:50.616 --> 24:52.659
Jerry, do you read me? Over.

24:52.743 --> 24:55.120
Yeah, go for Melbourne. That you, Katie?

24:55.204 --> 24:57.748
Jerry, we got a call from Mactown.

24:57.831 --> 25:01.043
...major storm coming in. Over.

25:01.126 --> 25:04.046
You'll have to go again.
We're in a bad spot here.

25:04.087 --> 25:08.217
Jerry... back to field base.
Do you copy?

25:08.258 --> 25:12.888
We got a major storm coming in.
Mactown wants you in right away. Over.

25:12.930 --> 25:15.307
All right. Copy that. We'll be back.

25:15.390 --> 25:17.351
When do we expect this storm?

25:19.895 --> 25:21.563
Katie?

25:25.275 --> 25:27.653
Sorry, doc. Looks like
we're gonna have to pack up.

25:27.736 --> 25:32.366
- Well, when do we have to leave?
- We leave first thing, tomorrow.

25:57.599 --> 26:00.018
- Listen, Jerry...
- You heard what she said.

26:00.102 --> 26:05.065
Now, Jerry, look. I cannot
go back without at least trying.

26:05.148 --> 26:07.609
Yeah, well, that's not your call.

26:07.693 --> 26:09.653
No. It's not.

26:09.695 --> 26:11.780
There's a major storm coming in,
all right?

26:11.864 --> 26:13.949
Not a minor one, but a major.

26:13.991 --> 26:16.660
Down here there's a big difference
between the two.

26:16.743 --> 26:19.621
My job as your guide
is to get you back home in one piece,

26:19.705 --> 26:21.498
and that's exactly what I'm gonna do.

26:21.582 --> 26:25.043
But Jerry, we're talking
about a rock from another world.

26:25.127 --> 26:29.631
This ice floe might give us the first
meteorite from the planet Mercury.

26:29.715 --> 26:32.384
That could lead us
to discoveries we can't imagine.

26:32.467 --> 26:34.678
When you climb a mountain,
go up a river,

26:34.761 --> 26:39.183
the exciting part isn't what you know
is there. It's what you don't know.

26:39.266 --> 26:42.978
It's what you might find,
and it's the same here.

26:43.061 --> 26:47.149
I came halfway around the world to look
for something that's important to me.

26:47.232 --> 26:49.484
Jerry, please, you...

26:51.570 --> 26:54.323
You gotta take chances
for the things you care about.

26:59.036 --> 27:01.038
Half the day on the east slope.

27:01.121 --> 27:03.957
But I want to be back
on that sled tomorrow by noon.

27:04.041 --> 27:06.877
I'll take that. I'll take that.

28:00.180 --> 28:02.182
No.

28:30.878 --> 28:33.088
Hey, we're running
out of time here, doc.

28:33.172 --> 28:35.382
Believe me, I know.

29:03.994 --> 29:05.954
Hey, Jerry.

29:07.372 --> 29:10.292
- I think we got something here.
- Hey, wait, doc!

29:10.334 --> 29:12.544
Doc, wait a minute. Doc, don't move.

29:12.628 --> 29:14.338
You're outside the safety zone.

29:14.421 --> 29:17.674
This is a big one.
Eleven centimeters across, fully intact.

29:17.758 --> 29:20.802
It looks like a basalt,
but it's like nothing I've ever seen.

29:20.844 --> 29:23.180
- Jerry!
- Doc! Doc, don't move.

29:23.263 --> 29:26.308
That area's unchecked.
I told you to stay inside the flags.

29:26.391 --> 29:28.519
Oh, my God. This is it!

29:28.602 --> 29:30.103
Great, doc. Stay still.

29:30.187 --> 29:33.440
I'm glad you found your rock,
but let's get you out of there.

29:33.524 --> 29:37.027
Just follow your footsteps out.
Step right in your footprints.

29:38.946 --> 29:42.324
Man, I knew I could find it! Huh?
What'd I tell you? This is it.

29:42.366 --> 29:44.993
Half a day! Thank you.

29:45.035 --> 29:47.788
Now that you scared the hell out of me,
can we go home now?

29:47.871 --> 29:50.874
- Yeah.
- All right. Let's go.

29:52.668 --> 29:56.338
Victoria, this is Mactown. Come in.

29:56.380 --> 29:58.423
Victoria here. We copy you, Mactown.

29:58.507 --> 30:02.135
The approaching storm
has picked up speed and intensity.

30:02.219 --> 30:05.514
We are sending you the coordinates.
Mactown out.

30:05.556 --> 30:08.433
Copy that, Mactown.
Over and out.

30:08.517 --> 30:10.686
Field base to Melbourne. Come in.

30:26.451 --> 30:29.663
Whoa. Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa!

30:29.746 --> 30:32.666
Whoa! Easy there, team! Easy.

30:32.749 --> 30:34.209
What's up?

30:34.293 --> 30:36.879
I got to do a patch job
on one of the kids.

30:36.962 --> 30:39.339
Radio Katie.
See what's going on with that storm.

30:39.423 --> 30:40.382
All right.

30:42.885 --> 30:46.013
Ah, shoot. Looks like it's Old Jack.

30:46.096 --> 30:47.806
Come here, Jack.

30:48.682 --> 30:52.436
- Field base, come in.

30:52.519 --> 30:54.271
- Field base, come in.
- All right.

30:54.354 --> 30:56.106
- We'll get you fixed up.
- Field base?

30:56.190 --> 30:58.442
Got something in your paw?

30:58.525 --> 31:00.944
This is Melbourne team calling.

31:01.028 --> 31:02.905
Field base, can we get a?

31:03.739 --> 31:05.365
Doc!

31:13.123 --> 31:16.919
- Are you OK?

31:19.087 --> 31:21.298
I think I've broken my leg.

31:21.381 --> 31:24.384
All right. All right,
stay right there. I'll be right back!

31:27.304 --> 31:30.641
- Whoa!

31:30.724 --> 31:33.685
- Whoa! Wait, doc! Don't move!

31:33.769 --> 31:36.021
Doc! Doc!

31:39.399 --> 31:42.194
Doc! Hey! Don't tread water!

31:42.277 --> 31:43.487
Don't tread water!

31:45.322 --> 31:47.491
Look at me! You see the ice? Davis.

31:47.574 --> 31:49.576
Grab the ice!
Lt'll freeze you to it!

31:49.660 --> 31:52.579
It takes you a lot longer to freeze
than it does to drown!

31:57.543 --> 31:59.962
Good, good!
Davis, hang on! I'm coming down!

32:06.426 --> 32:08.595
All right, kids, come on!

32:13.851 --> 32:15.102
Hang on, doc!

32:23.402 --> 32:25.571
- Maya, come here.

32:25.654 --> 32:27.990
I can't... I can't breathe.
I can't breathe.

32:28.031 --> 32:30.033
Take deep breaths, doc.

32:33.537 --> 32:35.247
Maya, take the rope.

32:36.331 --> 32:37.875
Go to doc.

32:37.958 --> 32:42.671
She's coming to you, doc.
She's coming to you.

32:42.713 --> 32:45.674
OK, Maya, down.

32:45.716 --> 32:47.217
Good girl. Crawl to the doc.

32:57.728 --> 33:00.063
Come on, Maya, I got you. It's OK.

33:00.147 --> 33:04.526
- Come on, doc, stay in there with me.

33:05.235 --> 33:06.653
Come on, Maya.

33:07.738 --> 33:11.366
Easy, Maya. Easy.

33:13.744 --> 33:15.662
Good girl.

33:26.048 --> 33:28.926
Good job, Maya. Put the line over him.

33:29.009 --> 33:31.470
Good girl. Doc.

33:31.553 --> 33:33.555
Keep your left arm
on the ice, like it is,

33:33.639 --> 33:36.225
but I want you to reach up
with your right arm.

33:36.266 --> 33:39.144
You gotta get your elbow
and your arm up through the loop.

33:39.228 --> 33:42.105
You can do it. There you go.

33:43.065 --> 33:47.027
Good job, doc. Yeah, just like that.

33:47.110 --> 33:50.030
All right. Maya, come on.

33:52.908 --> 33:55.744
Good girl, Maya. Good girl.

33:55.786 --> 33:59.623
I got you, doc. I got you.

33:59.706 --> 34:01.333
Keep it tight.

34:02.000 --> 34:03.252
Line 'em up, Maya!

34:05.754 --> 34:09.174
Right now! Right now!
Come on! Take it home!

34:13.344 --> 34:14.888
Line up! Hike!

34:14.972 --> 34:17.933
- Come on, Maya! Come on, Old Jack!

34:18.934 --> 34:21.728
Come on, kids!

34:24.231 --> 34:26.817
Hike!

34:30.027 --> 34:33.782
All right, doc, you hang in there, OK?

34:33.866 --> 34:35.909
We're gonna get you home. All right?

34:35.993 --> 34:38.120
Don't you worry.

34:38.161 --> 34:41.164
- I'm gonna get you back.
- I'm sorry.

34:41.206 --> 34:43.542
You're gonna get home
and see your family, doc.

34:43.625 --> 34:46.085
You're gonna see your son, all right?

35:04.354 --> 35:06.064
Come here, Maya.

35:06.148 --> 35:09.109
Maya, you got to get us home!
Get us home!

35:15.324 --> 35:18.076
Go get up there, Max! Maya needs you!

35:20.829 --> 35:24.917
Right now! Right now! Hike! Hike!

35:45.312 --> 35:48.315
I can fly in this, Andy. You know I can.

35:48.398 --> 35:51.860
Sorry, Katie. It's not a question
of whether you could fly in it,

35:51.944 --> 35:54.196
but whether you could see anything.

35:54.279 --> 35:57.074
Don't worry, hon.
He's been in worse before.

35:57.157 --> 35:59.284
Worse than this?

36:04.248 --> 36:06.667
- What?

36:45.455 --> 36:48.083
Base to Melbourne team. Come in?

36:49.084 --> 36:51.253
Base to Melbourne. Come in.

36:51.336 --> 36:54.673
- This is Katie. Please, come in.

36:55.632 --> 36:59.511
- Jerry, do you copy? Over.

37:00.596 --> 37:03.432
Base out.

37:22.284 --> 37:24.578
Good, kids.

38:01.073 --> 38:04.535
About three here, right?

38:21.635 --> 38:24.096
Andy! Coop! Come on, they're here!

38:31.019 --> 38:34.189
Jerry! Jer, are you all right?

38:34.231 --> 38:37.234
He's got a broken leg!
And he's been in the water!

38:37.317 --> 38:39.278
- Get the stretcher now!
- Got it!

38:40.821 --> 38:43.031
- I don't like that cough.
- Get the dogs.

38:43.073 --> 38:45.450
Look at those hands! Get him in!

38:45.534 --> 38:47.536
-Come on, Jerry.
- Let's go!

38:47.619 --> 38:51.582
Good team. Good team.

38:52.916 --> 38:55.127
- Good girl, Maya!

38:55.210 --> 38:58.338
You got us home.

39:01.091 --> 39:03.218
All right,
let's have a look at this leg.

39:03.260 --> 39:06.221
Rosemary. Hypothermia kit.

39:06.263 --> 39:09.433
Put your hands in there.
We'll bring 'em back nice and slow.

39:09.516 --> 39:12.019
Hey. Buddy, how you feeling?

39:12.102 --> 39:14.688
- How are the dogs?
- Uh, good. I just fed them.

39:14.771 --> 39:17.733
- Get the rock off the sled too.
- The rock?

39:17.816 --> 39:21.111
- He found what he was looking for?
- Of course. He had a good guide.

39:21.195 --> 39:23.280
Soon as you can, get that plane ready.

39:23.363 --> 39:27.284
Dr. McClaren could lose this leg
without proper medical attention.

39:27.367 --> 39:31.079
- What are we gonna do about the dogs?
- There's only so much we can carry.

39:31.121 --> 39:33.707
I did speak to Mactown.
The winter team is ready to go.

39:33.790 --> 39:36.001
Katie can fly right back,
bring the dogs out.

39:36.084 --> 39:38.837
I'll wait here and, uh,
I'll fly out with the dogs later.

39:38.921 --> 39:42.508
No, that's out of the question.
That could be stage three frostbite

39:42.591 --> 39:45.469
and heaven knows what nerve damage
has already been done.

39:45.552 --> 39:49.264
Jerry, he's right.
I'll come right back. I promise.

39:49.306 --> 39:51.683
Let's get ready to pull out of here.

39:54.478 --> 39:56.104
Take them out.

39:56.188 --> 39:58.357
Watch his head.
Jer. I need some help.

39:58.440 --> 40:01.235
Be careful with that leg.

40:05.155 --> 40:07.741
Knock down the stretcher,
Rosemary.

40:09.117 --> 40:11.578
Coop. Coop, come help me
tighten the dogs' collars

40:11.662 --> 40:14.248
so they don't get loose.
Come on. Max! Come on!

40:14.331 --> 40:16.124
Good boy, Max.

40:21.255 --> 40:23.715
Come on, buddy. Come here.

40:26.218 --> 40:28.887
Come here, Max. Come here, Max.

40:28.971 --> 40:31.640
-Come here.
-Good boy. Good boy, Max.

40:31.682 --> 40:34.434
-All right. Here we go.
-Won't be long.

40:34.518 --> 40:36.562
Easy, Max. Easy.

40:36.645 --> 40:39.398
- Let's get the other ones.
- All right.

40:41.149 --> 40:43.151
- Hang in there, big guy.

40:50.075 --> 40:52.202
That's the last of 'em.

40:53.078 --> 40:54.788
All right, Maya.

40:54.872 --> 40:58.166
You keep 'em in line, all right,
and I'll be back. I promise.

40:58.250 --> 41:00.711
Be good. That's my girl!

41:31.200 --> 41:33.994
All right, buckle tight.
This one's gonna be rough.

41:36.622 --> 41:40.542
- Coop, I know you got that fear...
- Major... major fear of flying? Yeah.

43:51.048 --> 43:52.633
Ugh.

44:14.154 --> 44:15.155
Hey.

44:15.239 --> 44:17.074
Hey!

44:17.407 --> 44:19.368
Finally.

44:20.244 --> 44:21.578
Oh, man.

44:21.662 --> 44:24.414
Oh, you...
you are so lucky you passed out.

44:24.498 --> 44:25.499
We... [sighs]

44:25.582 --> 44:27.543
We were bouncing around up there, man,

44:27.584 --> 44:30.295
like one of those beach balls
at Dodger Stadium.

44:30.379 --> 44:33.549
And Katie was yelling at me
the whole time to stop screaming,

44:33.590 --> 44:36.385
but, uh, I couldn't do it.
It was way too intense, man.

44:36.468 --> 44:38.303
It was crazy.

44:39.179 --> 44:40.848
Where is everybody?

44:40.931 --> 44:43.350
Right here.
Everyone's here at Mactown.

44:43.433 --> 44:45.853
Davis is good. Uh, you're good.

44:45.936 --> 44:48.689
Your hands... You still have
your hands, which is good.

44:48.772 --> 44:51.275
Everything's...
everything's all good, man.

44:51.733 --> 44:53.777
Did Katie get the dogs OK?

44:54.778 --> 44:56.613
Yeah, well, um...

44:56.697 --> 44:59.366
Uh...

45:00.284 --> 45:03.328
Uh... No.

45:03.412 --> 45:06.331
They were telling her
that-that she should wait, maybe,

45:06.415 --> 45:08.667
you know, until things got better.

45:09.042 --> 45:12.754
Jer? It's been snowing
since we got here, man.

45:15.924 --> 45:17.467
Dude...

45:24.057 --> 45:26.768
Hey. You're finally up.

45:28.312 --> 45:30.647
- How are your hands feeling?
- They're fine.

45:30.731 --> 45:33.942
- How soon can we go back?
- I think you should get some rest, OK?

45:33.984 --> 45:35.068
No, Katie. How soon?

45:35.152 --> 45:37.571
The weather's gotten worse.
No one's flying in.

45:37.654 --> 45:39.239
When is it gonna get better?

45:40.324 --> 45:44.786
They've canceled the winter teams.
No one's going in till spring.

45:54.505 --> 45:56.673
I need it now!

45:57.174 --> 45:58.342
Excuse me, commander?

45:58.425 --> 46:00.802
- Who are you?
- Jerry Shepard. I'm with NSF.

46:00.844 --> 46:02.763
- Andy Harrison's crew?
- Yeah.

46:02.846 --> 46:06.141
We need a plane to the field base.
We weren't entirely evacuated.

46:06.183 --> 46:08.852
What? I ordered everybody
out of there yesterday.

46:08.936 --> 46:11.647
No, not everybody.
We left eight dogs there, sir.

46:11.688 --> 46:12.940
Dogs?

46:13.023 --> 46:16.944
I've got over 200 people, ten winter
teams to evacuate to New Zealand.

46:17.027 --> 46:19.530
Right. These dogs
are a part of our team, NSF.

46:19.613 --> 46:23.075
Captain, we've got a big problem
with some of the engines icing up.

46:23.158 --> 46:27.955
- We have to start moving some planes.
- Son, look. This is today.

46:28.038 --> 46:30.832
We've got a two-day window,
then another storm hits.

46:30.916 --> 46:33.001
If it lasts till here,
which they say it will,

46:33.085 --> 46:35.671
then we're into winter
and nobody flies.

46:35.712 --> 46:38.674
We don't have enough supplies
to keep everybody here.

46:38.715 --> 46:42.261
- So I'm a little busy right now.
- All we need is a plane, sir...

46:42.344 --> 46:44.680
- Do you want us to do that, sir?
- Do what?

46:44.721 --> 46:47.516
- Start moving some planes.
- Will you give me one minute?

46:49.518 --> 46:52.855
Listen. If we could just get a plane
like the one that we flew in on,

46:52.896 --> 46:54.815
it would only take three hours.

46:55.232 --> 46:58.360
Son, the only thing
we've got left are C-130s

46:58.402 --> 47:00.821
and they sure as hell
can't land at a field base.

47:02.364 --> 47:04.783
We can't just leave 'em out there.

47:06.076 --> 47:08.871
There's nothing I can do. I'm sorry.

47:10.497 --> 47:14.501
- Let's start moving those planes.
- Yes, sir, right away, captain.

47:22.676 --> 47:25.929
- Yeah, come in.

47:27.097 --> 47:28.557
Hey.

47:29.308 --> 47:31.560
How we doing?

47:31.602 --> 47:34.730
When's your flight leave?
You and Rosie?

47:34.771 --> 47:37.733
A couple hours ahead of you,
Coop and the doc.

47:39.985 --> 47:42.196
Jerry, I'm so sorry.

47:42.946 --> 47:45.073
I'm really sorry, Jerry.

47:45.115 --> 47:47.242
I don't want to talk about it.
You want a drink?

47:48.577 --> 47:49.745
Sure.

47:53.040 --> 47:58.045
- Fresca.
- Yeah, sorry. That's all I got.

47:58.128 --> 48:02.257
You know this wasn't your fault.
This wasn't anybody's fault.

48:02.299 --> 48:05.177
- We just left 'em there.
- Come on. We didn't just leave them.

48:05.260 --> 48:08.305
Don't do this to yourself.
The dogs are strong.

48:08.388 --> 48:09.765
Maybe there's a chance.

48:09.848 --> 48:13.101
We tightened their collars
so they wouldn't get loose.

48:16.146 --> 48:18.106
Listen, I...

48:18.190 --> 48:19.816
I know...

48:19.900 --> 48:23.612
I know you want me to find
a way to get us back there somehow.

48:23.654 --> 48:25.572
I know you're disappointed in me.

48:27.866 --> 48:29.493
No.

48:33.789 --> 48:36.959
You know, sometimes you just
have to lower your expectations.

48:47.511 --> 48:50.347
You know what, Jerry?
I'm sorry. I really am.

48:52.599 --> 48:54.351
I've got to go pack.

50:03.378 --> 50:07.591
Fill this out. Take it down to admin.
Just follow the red line on the floor.

50:07.674 --> 50:10.219
With any luck, you could
have some funding by August.

50:10.302 --> 50:12.304
August?

50:12.387 --> 50:15.933
No, wait. I don't think you understand.
In a few days those dogs...

50:16.016 --> 50:17.351
I have to go now.

50:17.434 --> 50:20.229
I'm sorry, Mr. Shepard.
Once winter sets in,

50:20.270 --> 50:23.524
as you know, there's no
coming or goings down there.

50:23.607 --> 50:25.984
We had to cancel
the winter teams this year.

50:26.068 --> 50:30.531
- Couldn't get 'em in before the storm.
- There must be somebody going south.

50:30.614 --> 50:35.661
Mr. Shepard, be reasonable. This is
the biggest Antarctic storm in 25 years.

50:35.744 --> 50:39.081
If you don't believe me,
take a look at this weather report.

52:21.016 --> 52:24.394
- Yeah, good, good.

52:24.478 --> 52:27.189
- Where's the rocket going?
- [Woman] What a surprise!

52:27.272 --> 52:29.066
- To Mars, Dad.
-Come on in.

52:29.149 --> 52:30.609
Yeah?

52:30.692 --> 52:32.361
Well, look who I found.

52:33.070 --> 52:35.531
Hey. Hey, world traveler.

52:35.572 --> 52:37.407
- How you been?
- I'm good, I'm good.

52:37.491 --> 52:39.952
- How's your fingers?
- Oh, I get to keep 'em.

52:40.035 --> 52:41.203
- Great.
- How's the leg?

52:41.245 --> 52:44.248
Hard to tell. The cast is
coming along great, thanks to Eric.

52:44.331 --> 52:46.542
There's a pot of coffee
in the kitchen, so...

52:46.625 --> 52:48.794
Eric, let's go find
a real coloring book.

52:48.877 --> 52:50.963
- What a great surprise.
- Give you a hand?

52:51.046 --> 52:52.548
- No, I'm all right.
- You got it?

52:52.631 --> 52:55.843
So, what brings you to LA?

52:57.052 --> 52:59.054
I brought you something.

53:06.854 --> 53:09.064
Thanks.

53:09.147 --> 53:12.276
I gotta get back there. Right now.

53:12.943 --> 53:17.322
I can't sleep at night. I've been
to NSF, agencies, foundations.

53:17.406 --> 53:20.659
I've been to TV networks to convince
them to follow me with a camera.

53:20.742 --> 53:24.121
Anything to raise money.
It just... It all takes too long.

53:24.204 --> 53:27.791
Now I've only got one week to get
back down there before winter hits.

53:27.875 --> 53:32.379
Then no one gets in for six months.
You've got those guys in your pocket.

53:32.462 --> 53:35.007
The, uh, the science fund guys.

53:35.090 --> 53:38.886
- The university endowment?
- They'd do anything for you right now.

53:39.720 --> 53:42.890
- Jerry, listen to what you're saying.
- No, it would just be me,

53:42.973 --> 53:45.267
just a three-day trip in.
You could tell 'em.

53:45.309 --> 53:49.229
- Tell 'em I'm scouting your next trip.
- They'd be throwing their money away.

53:49.313 --> 53:52.232
- No, they wouldn't.
- Even if you could get down there,

53:52.316 --> 53:53.775
- by now it's 50 below.
- No.

53:53.817 --> 53:56.945
Jerry, be realistic.
It's already been...

53:57.029 --> 53:59.865
I know how long it's been.

53:59.948 --> 54:03.035
But I need to know for sure.
I have to go.

54:03.660 --> 54:06.622
It's not possible, Jerry.

54:07.664 --> 54:10.292
It's just not possible.

54:12.085 --> 54:15.297
And you gotta find a way
to forget about all this.

54:16.590 --> 54:18.050
Forget?

54:19.718 --> 54:21.678
And you can do that?

01:00:51.652 --> 01:00:54.154
Hey, Jer. It's Kate.

01:00:54.238 --> 01:00:56.615
It's been a week.
Just checking if you're home yet.

01:00:56.698 --> 01:00:59.952
- Bye.

01:01:01.954 --> 01:01:05.499
Jer, it's Kate again.
Call me back. Bye.

01:07:03.649 --> 01:07:04.775
Over here.

01:07:06.443 --> 01:07:08.779
All right, the ocean
has a mind of its own.

01:07:09.488 --> 01:07:11.907
So respect the ocean. Stay alert.

01:07:13.408 --> 01:07:16.453
Now, go on ahead and take the paddle
like this, in both hands.

01:07:18.997 --> 01:07:21.917
There you go.
We're gonna do an even paddle,

01:07:21.959 --> 01:07:24.920
- alternating blades.

01:07:26.547 --> 01:07:27.923
Like that.

01:07:29.800 --> 01:07:31.927
Hey, Al, will you take over for me?

01:07:37.224 --> 01:07:39.309
Hey, what are you doing here?

01:07:39.393 --> 01:07:42.938
Somebody told me Jerry Shepard
was working at the kiddie pool.

01:07:43.021 --> 01:07:46.400
I said, "No way.
I have to see that for myself."

01:07:46.483 --> 01:07:48.735
Is that why you're here?
You're here to mock me?

01:07:48.777 --> 01:07:52.281
I'm the chauffeur.
Somebody else wanted to see you.

01:07:52.364 --> 01:07:56.243
Brandy! Come here. Go see Jerry!

01:07:58.287 --> 01:07:59.288
Wow.

01:07:59.371 --> 01:08:03.166
- Look who's all grown up and beautiful.
- She's smart too. Just like you said.

01:08:03.250 --> 01:08:06.753
Is she? Let's see
how well she's got you trained, then.

01:08:08.463 --> 01:08:10.966
Go get it!

01:08:15.137 --> 01:08:17.680
She's looking good.

01:08:17.764 --> 01:08:20.517
But I'm still not sure
what you're doing here.

01:08:20.600 --> 01:08:23.812
Come on. You didn't return my calls.
I got worried.

01:08:23.854 --> 01:08:28.149
- I've been busy.
- Oh, yeah, I can see that.

01:08:28.192 --> 01:08:30.903
What about you?
What have you been up to?

01:08:30.986 --> 01:08:34.156
Nothing much. I'm seeing somebody.

01:08:36.158 --> 01:08:37.868
- Really.
- Yeah, I mean,

01:08:37.951 --> 01:08:41.455
I'm not seeing him for long,
but I kind of like him.

01:08:41.496 --> 01:08:45.792
He's such the opposite of us.
A complete head guy.

01:08:45.834 --> 01:08:48.252
He's an engineer.

01:08:48.879 --> 01:08:50.756
Like on a train?

01:08:51.215 --> 01:08:52.925
Shut up.

01:08:57.345 --> 01:08:58.471
- Yeah.
- Good girl.

01:09:01.390 --> 01:09:04.435
- Go, Brandy!

01:09:09.524 --> 01:09:13.362
So I heard you pulled yourself
off the McKinley expedition.

01:09:14.738 --> 01:09:17.658
Listen, I know leaving the dogs
was hard for you.

01:09:17.698 --> 01:09:21.036
Well, it is what it is.
There's really nothing to talk about.

01:09:21.118 --> 01:09:23.205
Nothing to talk about? Jerry, come on.

01:09:23.287 --> 01:09:25.040
I don't want to talk about it.

01:09:25.707 --> 01:09:27.792
You can't just keep
hiding out here, Jerry.

01:09:27.876 --> 01:09:31.212
I mean, come on.
Renting kayaks to nine-year-olds?

01:09:32.714 --> 01:09:35.341
Well, what am I supposed
to do then, huh?

01:09:35.425 --> 01:09:38.804
Maybe you can help me out or something
'cause I'm not sure anymore.

01:09:38.886 --> 01:09:43.559
You know what you're supposed to do?
Let yourself off the hook.

01:09:43.600 --> 01:09:46.770
It doesn't mean that you have to forget.

01:10:40.282 --> 01:10:42.201
He knows a dog person
when he smells one.

01:10:42.284 --> 01:10:44.286
Hey, Mindo.

01:10:44.369 --> 01:10:46.955
- How you doing? Easy trip?
- Yeah, it wasn't bad.

01:10:47.039 --> 01:10:49.458
- Appreciate you seeing me.
- My pleasure.

01:10:49.541 --> 01:10:51.418
You're part of the family.

01:10:52.294 --> 01:10:55.005
Here. I thought you'd like to have this.

01:10:55.797 --> 01:10:58.300
Thanks. Come on in.

01:11:10.646 --> 01:11:13.065
So, you came to apologize, hmm?

01:11:15.025 --> 01:11:16.693
I just knew...

01:11:17.444 --> 01:11:20.155
I just knew that you raised 'em.

01:11:20.197 --> 01:11:24.993
You don't have to apologize to me.
It's not about being sorry for anything.

01:11:27.329 --> 01:11:28.664
What is it then?

01:11:33.001 --> 01:11:35.921
Back when I was a young man,

01:11:36.004 --> 01:11:40.300
my father ran a team of sled dogs
up in the Yukon.

01:11:41.176 --> 01:11:44.972
One summer he was out in the bush
walking with six of them.

01:11:45.722 --> 01:11:50.686
They came across a grizzly bear.
Young, but big.

01:11:50.727 --> 01:11:54.481
The first thing he did was maul
my father within an inch of his life.

01:11:54.523 --> 01:11:57.985
When he came to,
he saw that two of his dogs

01:11:58.026 --> 01:12:01.613
had been killed trying to save him.
The rest were gone.

01:12:02.739 --> 01:12:07.286
When he regained his strength,
he went out looking for his dogs.

01:12:07.369 --> 01:12:09.288
He said he had to.

01:12:12.165 --> 01:12:14.835
You know why I told you this story?

01:12:17.546 --> 01:12:19.882
Because I won't find my dogs.

01:12:20.591 --> 01:12:24.011
The story's not about the dogs.
It's about my father

01:12:24.052 --> 01:12:26.346
honoring what the dogs
had done for him.

01:12:27.973 --> 01:12:30.225
Jerry, what's important

01:12:30.267 --> 01:12:34.438
is finding that one thing
that will truly put your heart at rest.

01:15:23.524 --> 01:15:25.150
And now...

01:15:25.234 --> 01:15:27.778
And now, ladies and gentlemen,
please join with me

01:15:27.861 --> 01:15:32.241
in welcoming and honoring
the man who five months ago

01:15:32.282 --> 01:15:36.495
brought back from Antarctica
the first documented Mercury meteorite,

01:15:36.578 --> 01:15:38.205
Dr. Davis McClaren.

01:15:46.338 --> 01:15:48.924
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

01:15:50.259 --> 01:15:53.595
Thank you very much. There are
several people I wish to thank,

01:15:53.637 --> 01:15:56.098
but first and most important,
my family,

01:15:56.181 --> 01:15:59.226
my son, Eric,
and my wife, Dr. Eve McClaren,

01:15:59.309 --> 01:16:03.564
for her patience as I travel
around the world on these expeditions,

01:16:03.605 --> 01:16:07.109
many of which could be better
described as wild-goose chases.

01:16:08.402 --> 01:16:11.613
Um, I'd like to thank the university
for its continued support.

01:16:11.697 --> 01:16:13.949
I'd also like to take a moment

01:16:14.032 --> 01:16:18.662
to thank the entire team
at the NSF base,

01:16:18.745 --> 01:16:22.541
without whom this discovery

01:16:22.624 --> 01:16:26.879
and this scientist
would not have made it home.

01:16:37.472 --> 01:16:41.727
Thanks. Thanks.
Excuse me one second.

01:16:41.810 --> 01:16:43.437
- Thanks.
- Yeah, thanks. Hey.

01:16:43.520 --> 01:16:46.648
- There he is.
- Yeah. Scotch, rocks, please.

01:16:46.732 --> 01:16:49.109
The man of the hour. Congratulations.

01:16:49.151 --> 01:16:52.905
Well, I'm glad you could make it.
I wasn't sure you were gonna come down.

01:16:52.988 --> 01:16:54.615
Yeah.

01:16:54.656 --> 01:16:56.200
You know, about that...

01:16:56.283 --> 01:16:58.660
Last time I saw you,

01:16:58.744 --> 01:17:01.788
I tried to make my problems yours.
I shouldn't have done that.

01:17:01.872 --> 01:17:05.167
But it was hard to accept
that I couldn't get back to the dogs.

01:17:06.585 --> 01:17:08.504
So, where are you with all of that?

01:17:09.254 --> 01:17:11.006
Uh...

01:17:11.048 --> 01:17:13.717
Actually, I'm heading
to New Zealand later on tonight.

01:17:15.219 --> 01:17:17.679
So, you found a way back down?

01:17:17.721 --> 01:17:20.015
Part of the way.
I'll make it to Christchurch

01:17:20.098 --> 01:17:24.770
and if you hang out there long enough,
usually you can find a ride south.

01:17:24.853 --> 01:17:27.272
And if you don't?

01:17:29.358 --> 01:17:32.945
Well, it's, uh, like you said
to me the day that storm came in.

01:17:33.028 --> 01:17:35.405
You gotta take chances
for things you care about.

01:17:36.114 --> 01:17:37.866
Davis?

01:17:39.201 --> 01:17:42.329
Yeah, yeah. Just...
I'll be right with you.

01:17:42.371 --> 01:17:43.914
Go ahead, get back to the party.

01:17:43.997 --> 01:17:47.209
I wanna come in
and say congratulations once again.

01:17:47.292 --> 01:17:49.461
- Sure. Thanks for coming.
- You're welcome.

01:17:49.545 --> 01:17:52.714
- Give my best to your family.
- I will. And good luck, really.

01:17:52.798 --> 01:17:54.049
Thanks.

01:17:55.300 --> 01:17:57.427
Enjoy the evening.

01:18:10.566 --> 01:18:13.861
- Sitter says he's been down since 8:00.
- Oh, great.

01:18:13.902 --> 01:18:17.239
Which means he'll be up at 5:00.

01:18:22.119 --> 01:18:23.954
Hey, little man.

01:25:03.353 --> 01:25:05.522
- Hello.
- Hi.

01:25:05.606 --> 01:25:07.900
Is your boat for hire?

01:25:07.983 --> 01:25:10.736
- For what?
- I gotta get to McMurdo.

01:25:10.819 --> 01:25:13.655
Not a chance, mate.
It's a fishing boat.

01:25:13.739 --> 01:25:15.866
Looking for someone, you know Bailies?

01:25:15.949 --> 01:25:18.493
- Yeah.
- It's just up there. It's a bar.

01:25:18.577 --> 01:25:22.831
- All right, thanks. No chance, huh?
- Not in hell.

01:25:24.208 --> 01:25:27.044
You want me to take you
to Antarctica in the dead of winter

01:25:27.127 --> 01:25:28.629
on a 70-foot fishing trawler?

01:25:28.670 --> 01:25:32.382
Mm-hm. And I can pay you.
Not a lot, but everything I have.

01:25:32.466 --> 01:25:36.303
I'm sorry, mate. Everybody is looking
for a cheap ride out to McMurdo.

01:25:36.345 --> 01:25:38.472
Basically,
my boat's a margarita blender.

01:25:38.555 --> 01:25:40.933
First chunk of ice we hit,
we'll break in half.

01:25:41.016 --> 01:25:42.809
I've seen your boat. We can make it.

01:25:42.851 --> 01:25:46.104
- I'm desperate. You're my last option.
- No one in their right mind

01:25:46.188 --> 01:25:48.440
will take you in anything
but an icebreaker.

01:25:48.524 --> 01:25:52.194
Excuse me, sir.
The lady at the bar bought you a drink.

01:26:01.870 --> 01:26:04.498
No way. Excuse me.

01:26:08.043 --> 01:26:09.378
What are you doing here?

01:26:09.461 --> 01:26:12.506
Ah, some guy needed a cheap pilot
for an expedition

01:26:12.589 --> 01:26:14.466
and I'm always cheap in the off season.

01:26:14.550 --> 01:26:16.176
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:26:16.927 --> 01:26:19.221
- Good to see you.
- It's good to see you too.

01:26:20.222 --> 01:26:23.725
- So, where are you going?
-Same place I'm going.

01:26:27.396 --> 01:26:28.856
What the hell?

01:26:28.939 --> 01:26:31.608
- What's up, Jer?
- What's going on, buddy?

01:26:31.692 --> 01:26:33.569
- Hey, buddy. Aw!
- How you been?

01:26:33.652 --> 01:26:35.237
- Nice to see you.
- I missed you.

01:26:35.320 --> 01:26:37.406
Same here.

01:26:37.489 --> 01:26:40.325
What's really going on?
What kind of expedition is this?

01:26:40.409 --> 01:26:43.412
Uh, that'd be an NSF expedition.

01:26:43.495 --> 01:26:45.664
Yeah, I had a trip that was cut short.

01:26:45.747 --> 01:26:49.251
It turns out I got a couple of weeks
of grant money left and, uh...

01:26:49.334 --> 01:26:50.752
- Uh-huh.
- So here we are.

01:26:51.086 --> 01:26:53.088
You're the man. You are the man.

01:26:53.130 --> 01:26:55.340
How long you think
it'll take you to pack?

01:26:55.424 --> 01:26:59.595
- You know me, I'm always packed.
- Well, this way.

01:26:59.678 --> 01:27:02.347
Yeah! Yeah.

01:27:02.431 --> 01:27:03.682
Let's go! Let's go!

01:27:09.855 --> 01:27:11.273
Come on in, boys.

01:27:13.775 --> 01:27:16.111
- Whoo!
- This is crazy. I never expected this.

01:27:16.195 --> 01:27:18.530
Sometimes you gotta
raise your expectations.

01:27:24.620 --> 01:27:26.872
- Cooper, how you doing?
- I'd rather not talk.

01:27:26.955 --> 01:27:28.582
- OK.
- Thanks.

01:28:49.371 --> 01:28:53.625
Polarsyssel, this is helicopter
Lima-November-Oscar-Mike-Bravo

01:28:53.709 --> 01:28:55.335
requesting to land on your vessel.

01:28:55.419 --> 01:28:57.754
Roger,
Lima-November-Oscar-Mike-Bravo.

01:28:57.838 --> 01:29:00.257
- You're clear to land.
- Here we go, boys.

01:29:51.975 --> 01:29:54.520
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:29:57.523 --> 01:29:59.816
I thought you might like some company.

01:29:59.900 --> 01:30:01.860
Sure.

01:30:05.239 --> 01:30:08.033
It's a
good night for stargazing.

01:30:13.664 --> 01:30:16.375
Shooting stars
mean good luck, right?

01:30:18.335 --> 01:30:19.920
Jerry, you know,

01:30:19.962 --> 01:30:23.006
this may not be easy, what we find.

01:30:23.090 --> 01:30:25.300
I know that.

01:30:25.384 --> 01:30:28.512
But whatever we find,
the dogs deserve this trip.

01:30:31.974 --> 01:30:35.602
I'm glad you're here, Katie.
And I owe you one.

01:30:37.145 --> 01:30:41.233
You owe me for a lot of things.
This is not one of them.

01:30:41.316 --> 01:30:43.318
No, I'm serious.

01:30:43.402 --> 01:30:45.445
You always understood
why I had to do this.

01:30:49.157 --> 01:30:50.909
Careful, Jerry.

01:30:50.993 --> 01:30:53.161
You're starting to sound like a grownup.

01:30:55.289 --> 01:30:57.457
What about that
conductor friend of yours?

01:30:57.499 --> 01:31:00.460
- He's an engineer.
- Oh, yeah.

01:31:00.502 --> 01:31:03.088
We're not seeing each other anymore.

01:31:06.925 --> 01:31:08.886
That's too bad.

01:33:21.310 --> 01:33:24.938
Shut her down, Mr. Hansen.
Let's go take a look.

01:33:30.819 --> 01:33:33.030
What do you make of that?

01:33:33.113 --> 01:33:35.282
It's not good.

01:33:45.292 --> 01:33:47.961
The ice
is six feet about here.

01:33:52.841 --> 01:33:55.135
The ice is deeper than we thought.

01:33:55.177 --> 01:33:58.805
I guess we shouldn't be surprised,
given the winter we just had.

01:33:58.889 --> 01:34:02.184
Come halfway around the world
and we can't make it the last 100 miles.

01:34:03.477 --> 01:34:04.937
Sorry, mates.

01:34:05.020 --> 01:34:08.774
I guess now is last call
for a great idea.

01:34:10.025 --> 01:34:12.694
Simonetta.

01:34:12.778 --> 01:34:14.696
Simonetta who?

01:34:14.780 --> 01:34:18.033
His imaginary Italian girlfriend.
Come on, not now.

01:34:18.116 --> 01:34:20.911
An iceberg, all right,
broke off from an ice shelf.

01:34:20.994 --> 01:34:24.665
It blocked the route that the Adélie
penguins take for their fishing waters.

01:34:24.748 --> 01:34:28.043
- I'm not seeing the relevance.
- Horses, doc. Rein 'em in.

01:34:28.126 --> 01:34:31.421
Now, I needed to map the new route
so researchers could find 'em.

01:34:31.505 --> 01:34:36.510
While I was following them, they
led me right past the Italian base...

01:34:36.593 --> 01:34:39.054
...where one Simonetta Pirelli

01:34:39.137 --> 01:34:41.807
whipped me up
a mean cup of hot chocolate.

01:34:41.890 --> 01:34:45.936
- Come on, what are you talking about?
- Step into my office.

01:34:48.063 --> 01:34:51.525
Our base is too far for the helicopter
to make it there, right?

01:34:51.608 --> 01:34:54.528
But the Italian base is,
like, half the distance.

01:34:54.570 --> 01:34:57.406
- The young man's right about that.
- Still leaves us short.

01:34:57.489 --> 01:34:58.824
Right, right. Hold on. See,

01:34:58.907 --> 01:35:01.285
all field bases
have the same basic stuff, right?

01:35:01.368 --> 01:35:05.080
But the Italian base is equipped
with the Lamborghini of snowcats.

01:35:05.163 --> 01:35:07.416
I'm telling you,
this thing is like a rocket.

01:35:07.457 --> 01:35:10.794
So we take one of these snowcats
to our base, do what we came to do,

01:35:10.878 --> 01:35:12.087
blow out of Dodge.

01:35:12.171 --> 01:35:15.174
And this way, I get to spend
a little less time flying.

01:35:15.257 --> 01:35:16.884
No offense, Katie.

01:35:16.967 --> 01:35:19.469
Huh?

01:35:24.600 --> 01:35:25.809
All right, let's go.

01:38:20.943 --> 01:38:23.070
Ah! Ah!

01:38:23.111 --> 01:38:26.323
Ah, there it is!

01:38:40.712 --> 01:38:43.757
The keys are in number two.
The shovels are around the side.

01:38:43.841 --> 01:38:45.634
We gotta dig this place out.

01:38:56.812 --> 01:38:58.522
It's hard.

01:39:22.004 --> 01:39:23.964
Sweet.

01:39:57.289 --> 01:39:59.166
- All aboard!

01:39:59.208 --> 01:40:01.543
Nice snowcat, Coop.

01:40:14.348 --> 01:40:16.099
What?

01:40:21.230 --> 01:40:23.190
Not bad, huh, Jer?

01:40:23.232 --> 01:40:25.734
Well, what do you want me to say?
You're the man?

01:40:26.235 --> 01:40:27.778
That'd be nice.

01:40:29.071 --> 01:40:30.489
OK, you're the man.

01:40:31.406 --> 01:40:34.409
You are indeed the man, Cooper!
You are the man!

01:40:34.743 --> 01:40:36.578
Grazie, Geraldo. Grazie.

01:40:37.746 --> 01:40:40.541
And as for you, Crazy Katie,

01:40:40.582 --> 01:40:43.710
you know all those ridiculous flights
you put me through?

01:40:43.752 --> 01:40:45.379
Yeah.

01:40:45.420 --> 01:40:48.757
Payback is a dish best served cold.

01:40:48.799 --> 01:40:51.426
- Cooper, I think that's "revenge."

01:44:12.836 --> 01:44:14.463
It's Old Jack.

01:44:18.634 --> 01:44:21.762
We came all this way and they
didn't even make it off the chain.

01:45:07.015 --> 01:45:09.226
They got off.

01:45:12.980 --> 01:45:14.231
They got loose!

01:46:10.829 --> 01:46:12.789
Come on, kids!

01:46:12.873 --> 01:46:14.374
Come on!

01:46:21.924 --> 01:46:23.759
Come on, Max!

01:46:34.686 --> 01:46:36.188
Hey!

01:46:36.271 --> 01:46:38.273
Hey, Buck!

01:46:39.691 --> 01:46:41.276
Hey, Buck.

01:46:41.360 --> 01:46:43.028
Max, what you been doing?

01:46:43.111 --> 01:46:46.448
- OK, not the face! Not the face!
- No! You look so beautiful.

01:46:46.490 --> 01:46:49.576
OK, chill, boy! Chill, boy, not the...

01:46:49.660 --> 01:46:52.204
Good boy, Max. Good boy, Max.

01:46:57.417 --> 01:47:00.212
- Yeah...
- Told you we'd come back.

01:47:00.295 --> 01:47:02.422
Look at you guys. Huh?

01:47:02.464 --> 01:47:05.092
Shorty, come here.

01:47:05.133 --> 01:47:08.220
Not the... Hey, Jer!
A little help over here.

01:47:08.303 --> 01:47:09.930
A little help.

01:47:11.598 --> 01:47:14.059
Hey, Buck!
Leave him alone! Get over here!

01:47:15.853 --> 01:47:19.648
Whew! Thank you, Jer!

01:47:21.650 --> 01:47:22.860
Good boy, Buck.

01:47:23.986 --> 01:47:27.573
Shadow, Truman, Max and Shorty.

01:47:27.656 --> 01:47:29.992
Man, I don't believe it.

01:47:30.075 --> 01:47:32.119
Good boys.

01:47:32.160 --> 01:47:35.163
My five lucky stars.

01:47:37.833 --> 01:47:39.835
Almost perfect.

01:47:53.182 --> 01:47:55.267
Let's go home, kids. Come on.

01:47:59.062 --> 01:48:01.190
This should be enough
to get us home.

01:48:01.273 --> 01:48:04.193
- Give me a hand with this.
- OK.

01:48:07.029 --> 01:48:09.781
- All right, Shorty, up!

01:48:09.865 --> 01:48:12.326
Good boy! Come on, Shadow, let's go.

01:48:12.409 --> 01:48:15.037
Come on, buddy.
Come on, let's go. Get in the back.

01:48:15.120 --> 01:48:18.457
Come on! We're losing light here.
Party's over, come on.

01:48:18.540 --> 01:48:20.334
All right, Max, come on, buddy.

01:48:22.294 --> 01:48:24.505
- Wanna ride up front?
- Have it your way.

01:48:24.546 --> 01:48:26.965
Let's go. Up front. Ride with me.

01:48:27.049 --> 01:48:28.675
Come on, buddy. Jump up.

01:48:30.385 --> 01:48:32.221
Max! Max!

01:48:32.304 --> 01:48:34.223
Max!

01:48:49.279 --> 01:48:50.697
Maya.

01:49:17.266 --> 01:49:19.726
Aw, Maya.

01:49:19.810 --> 01:49:21.770
Come on now.

01:49:23.355 --> 01:49:25.357
Come on now.

01:49:27.943 --> 01:49:30.279
You did good.

01:49:30.362 --> 01:49:33.115
You did good, Max. Good boy.

01:49:33.198 --> 01:49:35.409
You brought her home.

01:49:37.619 --> 01:49:39.079
I'm sorry, girl.

01:49:59.391 --> 01:50:01.268
Maya?

01:50:02.895 --> 01:50:04.605
Hey.

01:50:06.398 --> 01:50:08.442
There's my girl.

01:50:09.985 --> 01:50:11.945
You're OK.

01:50:16.992 --> 01:50:19.620
How's my best girl doing, huh?

01:50:19.703 --> 01:50:23.832
Good girl, Maya.
All right, let's get you home, OK?

01:50:23.916 --> 01:50:25.459
Let's get you home.

01:50:32.299 --> 01:50:34.510
Coop. Coop.

01:50:55.739 --> 01:50:58.534
- She gonna be OK?
- Yeah, she's gonna be fine.

01:51:00.619 --> 01:51:03.539
What do you say, Coop?
Let's fire her up and get out of here.

01:51:03.622 --> 01:51:06.333
Yes, sir. I'll just make room
for one more.

01:51:06.375 --> 01:51:07.626
All right.

01:51:07.709 --> 01:51:10.546
Give me a hand here, Katie.
Let's get her in.

01:51:15.175 --> 01:51:17.344
Come here, Maya.

01:51:17.427 --> 01:51:20.305
- Got her? There you go.
- I think so.

01:51:20.389 --> 01:51:22.015
All right, Max. Let's go, buddy.

01:51:22.808 --> 01:51:25.561
Come on. Good boy.

01:51:35.195 --> 01:51:36.238
How's your girl?

01:51:41.159 --> 01:51:42.578
She's good.

01:52:05.434 --> 01:52:08.770
All right. Here we go.
