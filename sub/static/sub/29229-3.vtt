07:33.005 --> 07:33.923
- Yo.
- What's good?

07:34.005 --> 07:35.214
- Yo, Rick,
coolin', baby.

07:35.297 --> 07:36.464
- You a'ight?
- Yeah, man.

07:36.547 --> 07:37.964
You healing up
from that Kia collision?

07:38.047 --> 07:39.589
- Seriously,
it was a Prius, man.

07:39.673 --> 07:40.923
You can't hear 'em comin'.

07:41.005 --> 07:41.923
- Yeah, I hear you.
- [laughs]

07:42.005 --> 07:43.964
- Yo, where y'all headed?
- Nowhere fast.

07:44.047 --> 07:45.839
- Look, I got a couple cats
comin' to the crib, man.

07:45.923 --> 07:46.881
Y'all down to hang?

07:46.964 --> 07:48.589
- Shit, that's all I got
is time, brah.

07:48.673 --> 07:49.631
- Yeah, see you then.

07:49.714 --> 07:51.464
- A'ight, we'll be there.
Text me the address.

07:51.547 --> 07:53.297
- Got you, bro.
- My man.

07:53.381 --> 07:54.297
- There's nothin' worse

07:54.381 --> 07:55.339
than being ahead
of your time.

07:55.422 --> 07:56.964
- Pfft, how about
being behind it?

07:57.047 --> 07:58.964
- See, some people
just can't handle new ideas.

07:59.047 --> 08:00.130
- Right,
if it ain't their idea,

08:00.214 --> 08:01.130
they don't like it.

08:01.214 --> 08:02.172
- That's real.

08:02.255 --> 08:03.464
Hey, bro,
what can I do

08:03.547 --> 08:05.297
to get Joe
to buy in on me?

08:05.381 --> 08:06.839
- Man, I believe in you,
always have.

08:06.923 --> 08:07.881
Isn't that all
that matters?

08:07.964 --> 08:09.631
- Sadly, I need more.

08:09.714 --> 08:10.964
Dude thinks that messing
around with architects

08:11.047 --> 08:13.506
is more important
than the future of sports.

08:13.589 --> 08:15.172
- Galileo
had the same problem.

08:15.255 --> 08:16.172
- [laughs]

08:16.255 --> 08:17.631
What you know
about Galileo?

08:17.714 --> 08:19.673
- Almost as much
as I know about Copernicus.

08:19.756 --> 08:20.673
- Yo, are you seriously

08:20.756 --> 08:22.089
dropping Galileo
and Copernicus on me?

08:22.172 --> 08:23.255
How you know
about them boys?

08:23.339 --> 08:24.339
- Blinkist.

08:24.422 --> 08:25.964
It's the app
that shrinks books to audio.

08:26.047 --> 08:28.089
- So then you know
how I feel.

08:28.172 --> 08:29.339
- Yeah, man.

08:29.422 --> 08:31.673
- Only one way
to do this, then:

08:31.756 --> 08:33.297
show Joe the future,

08:33.381 --> 08:35.339
and it starts today
with your tryout.

08:35.422 --> 08:36.381
- [sighs]

08:36.464 --> 08:38.422
I ain't been this nervous
since my pro day.

08:40.422 --> 08:42.047
- Babe, if you get
stuck out there any longer,

08:42.130 --> 08:44.005
I'm gonna have to get
new batteries for the vibrator.

08:44.089 --> 08:45.881
- I know, babe.
I'm sorry.

08:45.964 --> 08:48.172
Besides Ricky,
who's never gonna play again,

08:48.255 --> 08:51.839
Kisan and his gang decided
to go "Boyz n the Hood"

08:51.923 --> 08:54.047
on this rival crew
at a Jack in the Box.

08:54.130 --> 08:56.506
- Doesn't take a clairvoyant
to see Kisan was gonna fuck up.

08:56.589 --> 08:58.714
Maybe it's time
for a career change.

09:00.214 --> 09:01.172
- Why'd you say that?

09:01.255 --> 09:02.172
- I don't know, maybe 'cause

09:02.255 --> 09:03.339
you're stressed to shit
all the time,

09:03.422 --> 09:04.964
talking like you're
a 60-year-old mine worker?

09:05.047 --> 09:06.964
- It is so weird
that you would say that

09:07.047 --> 09:09.756
because I had a meeting
with Spencer earlier today,

09:09.839 --> 09:13.381
and that fool bought the Chiefs
and offered me a job.

09:13.464 --> 09:14.881
Maybe you are clairvoyant.

09:14.964 --> 09:16.714
- Maybe I'm the Miami Medium.

09:16.798 --> 09:17.714
What's the gig?

09:17.798 --> 09:18.881
- GM.

09:18.964 --> 09:20.214
- Isn't the GM spot
just as stressful

09:20.297 --> 09:21.339
as what you're doing now?

09:21.422 --> 09:22.422
- In a way, but, you know,

09:22.506 --> 09:23.714
I wouldn't have
to answer to clients,

09:23.798 --> 09:24.923
although I've never worked
for anybody,

09:25.005 --> 09:27.339
so I'm not sure I'll be crazy
about having a boss,

09:27.422 --> 09:29.172
although it would be Spencer.

09:29.255 --> 09:30.547
- You work for everyone,
even me,

09:30.631 --> 09:31.714
and you're doing just fine.

09:31.798 --> 09:33.923
- [sighs] Well, thank you
for the report card.

09:34.005 --> 09:35.923
Maybe you should change
those batteries after all.

09:36.005 --> 09:37.005
- Don't be a dick.

09:37.089 --> 09:38.172
I'm just saying

09:38.255 --> 09:39.506
if we're gonna have to move
to fuckin' Kansas City,

09:39.589 --> 09:41.172
you should at least make sure
you guys would be a good team.

09:41.255 --> 09:42.839
- Well, no shit.

09:42.923 --> 09:44.172
- Business isn't friendship.

09:44.255 --> 09:46.214
You should do due diligence.
Go talk to Joe.

09:46.297 --> 09:47.422
He'll tell you
what it's really like

09:47.506 --> 09:48.464
to work with Spencer.

09:48.547 --> 09:50.089
- That's a good idea, babe.
- Good.

09:50.172 --> 09:52.798
Now, why don't you show me
a little somethin'?

You can drive.

She don't want

11:19.214 --> 11:20.130

- Charles, your job is to
manage a winning football team,

11:24.798 --> 11:26.297
not to be the judge
and the jury.

11:26.381 --> 11:28.673
- Just don't know if I can
wrap my conscience around it.

11:28.756 --> 11:30.297
- Rocking the boat now
based on a rumor

11:30.381 --> 11:32.130
does not seem
like a smart idea.

11:32.214 --> 11:33.714
- It's not exactly
a rumor, baby.

11:33.798 --> 11:34.714
They found a gun.

11:34.798 --> 11:35.839
- Well, did he shoot it?

'Cause if not, I don't know
what the big deal is.

not a judge up for a seat
in the Supreme Court.

11:41.547 --> 11:43.005
- So I should
turn a blind eye?

11:43.089 --> 11:45.381
- I'm saying
it's irrelevant, Charles.

11:45.464 --> 11:46.714
Extracurricular activities

11:46.798 --> 11:49.339
is not a statistic
you get paid to look at,

11:49.422 --> 11:51.172
especially when we're about
to have two kids

11:51.255 --> 11:53.047
to put through college.

11:53.130 --> 11:55.047
- Yeah.

11:55.130 --> 11:56.047
Yeah, maybe you're right.

11:56.130 --> 11:57.923
- Of course I'm right.

If the Ravens woulda

11:59.089 --> 12:01.047
cut Ray Lewis
after his little incident,

they woulda never won
the Super Bowl.

than being a mommy.

help me clear my head up.

you for that.

How you feelin'?

12:22.589 --> 12:24.506
maybe everybody else
has the right idea

12:24.589 --> 12:27.130
and we should just start
looking out for ourselves.

takes practice.

going with your instincts,

12:38.255 --> 12:39.964
staying committed
to what you believe,

12:40.047 --> 12:42.714
that shit doesn't come easy.

12:42.798 --> 12:46.381
You'll feel like
you're taking body shots,

12:46.464 --> 12:49.923
but if you stay on your feet,
no one will fuck with you.

- Antolotti the Italiano,
buongiorno.

12:56.297 --> 12:58.923
- Joe Krutel,
the whitest man in America.

12:59.005 --> 13:00.547
I was just dialing you.

13:00.631 --> 13:02.547
- Oh, yeah?
What about?

13:02.631 --> 13:04.381
- Well, I have an odd question.

13:04.464 --> 13:06.589
I'm wondering what it's like
to work with Spencer.

13:06.673 --> 13:08.255
- Yeah, that--that sounds like
an odd question,

13:08.339 --> 13:10.089
all right,
just like you promised.

13:10.172 --> 13:11.089
How do you mean?

13:11.172 --> 13:12.923
- I mean, I know
we're all boys and shit,

13:13.005 --> 13:16.422
but on the day-to-day,
did you enjoy working with him?

13:16.506 --> 13:17.756
- Why are you asking me?

13:17.839 --> 13:21.130
- Well, he offered me
the GM job for the Chiefs.

13:21.214 --> 13:22.881
- No shit.

13:22.964 --> 13:25.422
I thought you loved
being an agent.

13:25.506 --> 13:26.798
- No, I do, I definitely do.

13:26.881 --> 13:28.839
It's just gettin' to be
too much.

13:28.923 --> 13:30.839
It's a young man's game,
and I'm, you know...

13:30.923 --> 13:32.047
- Not young.

13:32.130 --> 13:33.839
- Exactly, I gotta start
thinking about the future.

13:33.923 --> 13:36.297
- Mm. So sounds like
you and Donna

13:36.381 --> 13:37.673
are talking about
starting a family.

13:37.756 --> 13:38.964
- No, we actually don't even

13:39.047 --> 13:40.297
talk about
that sort of thing.

13:40.381 --> 13:41.839
- Why, that's odd, huh?

13:41.923 --> 13:42.839
- [sighs]
Why?

13:42.923 --> 13:43.964
Why would I
bring that shit up?

13:44.047 --> 13:45.422
- Well, just because
you're not talking about it

13:45.506 --> 13:47.589
doesn't mean she's not
thinking about it, idiot.

13:47.673 --> 13:49.172
- Yeah, you're right.

13:49.255 --> 13:50.255
You see, that's why I need

13:50.339 --> 13:52.047
to be thinking about
my professional future.

13:52.130 --> 13:54.297
- Oh, yeah, that's
the sexy stuff right there.

13:54.381 --> 13:57.589
Now let me add a little bit
more sexiness to it.

13:57.673 --> 14:00.339
Since you're considering
making moves,

14:00.422 --> 14:01.381
what if I buy your agency?

14:01.464 --> 14:03.339
You know,
hire a couple young bucks

14:03.422 --> 14:04.798
to help you do your thing,

14:04.881 --> 14:06.381
and what's old
becomes new again.

14:06.464 --> 14:07.547
- Well, I should
find a card game,

14:07.631 --> 14:09.047
'cause I'm on fire today.

14:09.130 --> 14:10.339
- Well, think about it.

14:10.422 --> 14:13.047
Talk to Donna and, uh,
hit me up with a number.

14:13.130 --> 14:17.130
Oh, and J,
Spencer's a fuckin' nightmare.

14:17.214 --> 14:19.172
- Yeah, I figured.

14:19.255 --> 14:20.964
