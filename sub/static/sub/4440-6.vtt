00:20.243 --> 00:21.843
MAN: Can't find that in Sheboygan.

00:22.629 --> 00:23.890
(laughing)

00:23.891 --> 00:24.796
Huh?

00:24.797 --> 00:26.898
- Why don't you help me out here?
- Yes, ma'am.

00:33.773 --> 00:35.707
Oh... (chuckles)
Oh, hey, Ryan.

00:35.708 --> 00:37.341
I, um, didn't see you there.

00:37.342 --> 00:39.512
Yeah, I didn't see you, either.

00:39.513 --> 00:42.682
That's so weird that neither
of us saw each other.

00:42.683 --> 00:45.118
- You remember my boyfriend Drew.
- What's up, bro?

00:45.119 --> 00:46.721
DREW: Oh.

00:46.722 --> 00:48.322
We're going to put some burgers

00:48.323 --> 00:49.690
on the grill later.

00:49.691 --> 00:51.492
Maybe crack some brews?

00:51.493 --> 00:52.827
Yeah, you should come.

00:52.828 --> 00:54.129
Sounds fun.

00:54.130 --> 00:55.964
Here comes the corny nickname.

00:55.965 --> 00:57.666
See you then, Ry-Guy.

00:57.667 --> 00:59.601
And here comes the part
where he carries her

00:59.602 --> 01:01.837
into the house like a Viking
on a rape quest.

01:01.838 --> 01:03.473
(laughing): No! No! Come on.

01:10.815 --> 01:13.851
He's going to wreck that, mate.

01:15.587 --> 01:17.689
WILFRED: I know how
you feel about Jenna.

01:17.690 --> 01:20.725
Stop pretending this whole Drew
situation doesn't make you sick.

01:20.726 --> 01:22.360
I'm surprised
you still have an appetite.

01:22.361 --> 01:23.628
What am I going to do?

01:23.629 --> 01:25.229
She's dating Drew,

01:25.230 --> 01:27.164
and he doesn't seem
like such a bad guy.

01:27.165 --> 01:29.133
Mm.
Not a bad guy, huh?

01:29.134 --> 01:30.968
Have you any idea
what it feels like

01:30.969 --> 01:32.469
to have someone come
into your house,

01:32.470 --> 01:33.704
treat you with no respect

01:33.705 --> 01:35.505
and act like they
own the place?

01:37.341 --> 01:39.576
Did you eat my sandwich?

01:39.577 --> 01:40.844
Oh, I get it.

01:40.845 --> 01:42.879
Because I'm a dog, right?

01:42.880 --> 01:45.948
I can only imagine
what you'd say if I was black.

01:49.986 --> 01:52.087
- Hey, Ryan.
- Wait for it.

01:52.088 --> 01:54.022
(laughing):
Yeah! Ry-Bread!

01:54.023 --> 01:58.928
Hey, Drew... a blank.

01:58.929 --> 02:00.330
Ha! Burgers will be up soon.

02:00.331 --> 02:02.398
Have a seat, bro.

02:02.399 --> 02:04.367
RYAN: Uh...

02:04.368 --> 02:06.435
I-I don't...
I don't mind standing.

02:06.436 --> 02:07.669
Oh, don't be ridiculous.

02:07.670 --> 02:08.937
Hey, Wilfy, down.

02:10.874 --> 02:12.007
Go on.

02:17.614 --> 02:19.115
DREW: That's it.

02:19.116 --> 02:22.118
You love your Big Daddy Drew.
Yes, you do.

02:22.119 --> 02:23.987
Now, sit.

02:23.988 --> 02:25.188
- In the dirt?
- Wilfy, sit.

02:26.924 --> 02:30.026
DREW: Ah! That's my boy.

02:30.027 --> 02:33.529
Wow. Never seen Wilfred
so well-behaved.

02:33.530 --> 02:35.164
Oh, he's always
like that with Drew.

02:35.165 --> 02:37.065
I think it's
the sound of his voice.

02:37.066 --> 02:38.400
He's got a pack mentality.

02:38.401 --> 02:39.801
Dogs want to please
their alpha,

02:39.802 --> 02:41.203
so they like to know
who's in charge.

02:43.606 --> 02:47.809
Look, I live and breathe
Sheboygan Lager sales,

02:47.810 --> 02:50.478
so when I find out
this Milwaukee's Brew guy

02:50.479 --> 02:53.514
is talking to my clients,
here's what I do.

02:53.515 --> 02:55.917
I go into his territory,

02:55.918 --> 02:59.955
and I take 15 store managers
out golfing in one week.

02:59.956 --> 03:01.256
And before I know it,

03:01.257 --> 03:04.126
my sales are up 40%.

03:04.127 --> 03:05.394
(Drew chortling)

03:05.395 --> 03:07.096
About a month later,

03:07.097 --> 03:09.198
I see this Milwaukee's
Brew guy at a bar.

03:09.199 --> 03:11.534
He's looking all
drunk and depressed.

03:11.535 --> 03:15.304
Turns out he lost his job.

03:15.305 --> 03:17.806
- Aw.
- So I bought him a beer.

03:17.807 --> 03:19.675
A Sheboygan Lager!
Come on!

03:19.676 --> 03:21.209
Yeah!

03:21.210 --> 03:23.145
Don't you think that
was a little harsh, Drew?

03:23.146 --> 03:25.180
Insert moronic
sports metaphor here.

03:25.181 --> 03:26.982
When it comes to beverage sales,

03:26.983 --> 03:30.185
you either swing for the fences
or you get off the field.

03:30.186 --> 03:31.920
Nauseating.

03:31.921 --> 03:33.188
I don't understand, Wilfred.

03:33.189 --> 03:34.590
If you hate Drew so much,

03:34.591 --> 03:36.058
why do you do
everything he says?

03:36.059 --> 03:37.960
I don't know, Ryan.

03:37.961 --> 03:39.829
- Why do you do everything I say?
- I don't.

03:39.830 --> 03:42.130
- Hey!
- DREW: Aw, drop it.

03:42.131 --> 03:43.065
Now.

03:45.102 --> 03:47.137
Dogs shouldn't eat
from the table, Ry.

03:47.138 --> 03:49.239
Makes 'em think
they're our equals.

03:49.240 --> 03:50.607
But that doesn't mean
we can't have

03:50.608 --> 03:52.943
a little fun, now, does it, Wilfy?

03:52.944 --> 03:55.946
- Do that again, and I swear to...
- What?

03:55.947 --> 03:57.113
JENNA: Careful, Drew.

03:57.114 --> 03:58.648
Oh, it is on.

03:58.649 --> 04:00.517
(chuckling): Oh.
Wilfred loves to wrestle.

04:00.518 --> 04:02.352
- Here we go.
- Bring it on, bitch.

04:02.353 --> 04:04.354
I'm going to punch those perfect
white teeth down your throat.

04:04.355 --> 04:06.256
(Drew grunting)

04:06.257 --> 04:07.390
Great guy.

04:07.391 --> 04:08.859
He really is.

04:08.860 --> 04:10.727
I just wish he wasn't
so competitive.

04:10.728 --> 04:12.596
(Drew grunting, Wilfred panting)

04:12.597 --> 04:14.030
DREW: You fur ball!

04:14.031 --> 04:16.433
Got to be competitive to
be good at sales, right?

04:16.434 --> 04:18.968
Yes, but sometimes
he takes it too far.

04:18.969 --> 04:20.603
You know, like last Christmas,

04:20.605 --> 04:23.073
my dad beat him at Wii Golf,
and he got so angry

04:23.074 --> 04:24.741
that he threw the controller
through the window.

04:24.742 --> 04:27.076
I was so upset, I didn't talk
to him for a week.

04:27.077 --> 04:29.579
Well, nobody's perfect.

04:29.580 --> 04:31.781
Well, that's true.

04:31.782 --> 04:34.884
(chuckles) And Wilfy's
just crazy about him.

04:34.885 --> 04:36.118
WILFRED:
I'll bite off your ears

04:36.119 --> 04:37.786
and box the bloody holes
that remain!

04:37.787 --> 04:39.654
And he's got a good heart,

04:39.655 --> 04:41.756
and... he makes me
really happy.

04:41.757 --> 04:43.725
(Drew growling playfully)

04:43.726 --> 04:45.192
(laughing):
All right.

04:45.193 --> 04:47.828
I think the big fella's
all tuckered out.

04:47.829 --> 04:49.996
(wheezing)

04:49.997 --> 04:53.967
(gasping): Your death...
will be... my holiday.

04:55.836 --> 04:57.671
(ringtone playing)

05:01.476 --> 05:03.210
Hello?

05:03.211 --> 05:04.344
WILFRED: Ryan, it's me.

05:04.345 --> 05:05.946
Wilfred, what's wrong?

05:05.947 --> 05:07.648
Back-to-back-to-back-to-back-
to-back orgasms.

05:07.649 --> 05:08.849
That's what's wrong.

05:08.850 --> 05:10.350
I'm hanging up.

05:10.351 --> 05:12.819
(electronic chiming)

05:14.856 --> 05:16.156
What?

05:16.157 --> 05:17.557
Ryan, it's me again.

05:17.558 --> 05:19.392
We can't sit by
and let this caveman

05:19.393 --> 05:21.761
get his naughty-boy on
with the love of our life.

05:21.762 --> 05:24.230
Or maybe you need
some more convincing.

05:24.231 --> 05:26.966
(Jenna moaning and screaming)
(gasps)

05:26.967 --> 05:29.935
- We have to get rid of Drew.
- Wilfred, Jenna's in love.

05:29.936 --> 05:32.271
I don't want to do anything
to hurt their relationship.

05:32.272 --> 05:35.408
- Why not?
- Because it's wrong. Stop bothering me.

05:35.409 --> 05:37.411
I will not
stop bothering you until...

05:37.412 --> 05:38.679
DREW: Wilfy, quiet!

05:38.680 --> 05:39.713
(quietly):
Gotta go.

05:43.218 --> 05:44.886
JENNA (through wall):
Yeah! Oh!

05:44.887 --> 05:46.621
(moaning)

05:46.622 --> 05:48.590
Bring it! Oh!

05:48.591 --> 05:49.925
(grunts)

05:49.926 --> 05:51.526
Put your legs up.

05:51.527 --> 05:53.362
Put your legs up, please.

05:53.363 --> 05:55.130
Come on.
Come on, Bear.

05:55.131 --> 05:56.398
Work with me here.

05:56.399 --> 05:58.933
Aah! What's the use?

05:58.934 --> 06:02.570
(pants) You see what Drew
does to me, Ryan?

06:02.571 --> 06:04.105
I'm so emasculated,
I can't even

06:04.106 --> 06:07.042
raise a fence post
for stupid old Bear.

06:07.043 --> 06:09.444
I need your help.

06:09.445 --> 06:12.880
What you're asking me to do
goes against my conscience.

06:12.881 --> 06:15.183
- I couldn't live with myself.
- Really?

06:15.184 --> 06:16.918
But Drew sex-punching Jenna
for hours on end--

06:16.919 --> 06:18.353
you can live with that?

06:18.354 --> 06:20.755
Look, we just have
to be patient.

06:20.756 --> 06:23.191
Long-distance relationships
almost never last.

06:23.192 --> 06:24.992
And from what Jenna tells me,

06:24.993 --> 06:26.394
it sounds like they've
got other problems.

06:26.395 --> 06:27.896
From what Jenna tells you?

06:27.897 --> 06:31.700
So... so you guys are,
like, girlfriends now?

06:31.701 --> 06:33.069
No.

06:33.070 --> 06:35.305
This is how it started
with Jenna's

06:35.306 --> 06:38.975
old college chum,
Bobby "Blue Balls" Davis.

06:38.976 --> 06:41.612
The only scoring he did
was the triple letter bonus

06:41.613 --> 06:43.347
on their nightly Scrabble game.

06:43.348 --> 06:45.850
You want to go down like that?
(knock at door)

06:45.851 --> 06:48.085
You're running out of time.

06:49.455 --> 06:51.556
Hey.

06:51.557 --> 06:53.224
You here to pick up Wilfred?

06:53.225 --> 06:54.558
Actually, I was going to ask you

06:54.559 --> 06:56.060
to keep him a little longer.

06:56.061 --> 06:57.361
We're going out to dinner
to celebrate.

06:57.362 --> 06:59.330
I'm coming to L.A., bro!

06:59.331 --> 07:00.931
I'm moving in with Jenna!

07:00.932 --> 07:02.333
(both laughing excitedly)

07:02.334 --> 07:04.301
Looks like you better
start brushing up

07:04.302 --> 07:05.635
on your seven-letter
Scrabble words.

07:05.636 --> 07:07.670
Here's a few for you.

07:07.671 --> 07:08.904
Sexless.

07:08.905 --> 07:09.939
Flaccid.

07:09.940 --> 07:11.073
Dry-dick.

07:11.074 --> 07:12.942
Shall I go on?

07:18.776 --> 07:20.777
All right.
Here's what I'm thinking.

07:20.778 --> 07:22.446
We wait until Drew is asleep,

07:22.447 --> 07:25.816
and then we put his hand
in warm water.

07:25.817 --> 07:28.553
Then, just when he starts
to pee himself,

07:28.554 --> 07:30.756
we take a rock
and crush his skull.

07:30.757 --> 07:32.291
(laughs) That's your plan?

07:32.292 --> 07:34.293
Well, how would you kill him?

07:34.294 --> 07:37.597
What's the one thing Jenna
hates most about Drew?

07:37.598 --> 07:40.500
Vaginal tearing
from his huge cock.

07:40.501 --> 07:42.769
He's a sore loser.

07:42.770 --> 07:45.905
Look, all I have to do
is beat him at something

07:45.906 --> 07:47.841
and make sure Jenna's there
to see him lose his shit.

07:47.842 --> 07:50.043
That is the stupidest,
most ridiculous...

07:50.044 --> 07:51.745
Actually, that's pretty good.

07:51.746 --> 07:53.814
Except for one thing.

07:53.815 --> 07:57.117
Drew's a born winner,
and you're... you.

07:57.118 --> 08:01.288
That may be true, but there
is something I'm really good at.

08:02.957 --> 08:05.192
Ah. Here we go.

08:08.764 --> 08:10.798
What the hell is that?

08:10.799 --> 08:12.233
My old chemistry set.

08:16.005 --> 08:18.339
"Little Suzy Baker's Oven."

08:18.340 --> 08:20.708
What are you going to do,
challenge Drew to a Bake-Off?

08:20.709 --> 08:21.876
That was my sister's.

08:27.149 --> 08:29.717
Behold...

08:29.718 --> 08:32.186
the instrument of
Drew's destruction.

08:32.187 --> 08:35.455
(makes whirring sound)

08:35.456 --> 08:37.256
My Ping-Pong paddle

08:37.258 --> 08:39.860
from when I was All-State
Table Tennis champion.

08:39.861 --> 08:42.796
So chemistry, baking
and Ping-Pong.

08:42.797 --> 08:44.798
I guess my only question is:

08:44.799 --> 08:47.134
how were you not
blow-jobbed to death

08:47.135 --> 08:48.669
by the entire
cheerleading squad?

08:52.340 --> 08:54.141
The beagle has landed.

08:54.142 --> 08:55.242
DREW: Wilfred!

08:55.243 --> 08:57.177
I'm sorry, man.

08:57.178 --> 08:59.913
I tried to get him in the
house, and he ran over here.

08:59.914 --> 09:02.449
- You crazy mutt.
- Going somewhere?

09:02.450 --> 09:04.851
Oh, yeah.
Some play downtown.

09:04.852 --> 09:06.720
Jenna's almost ready.

09:06.721 --> 09:07.854
You're a Ping-Pong guy, huh?

09:07.855 --> 09:09.189
I dabble.

09:09.190 --> 09:10.991
Yeah, I used to play.

09:10.992 --> 09:12.359
Used to?

09:12.360 --> 09:14.595
Yeah, I kind of promised Jenna

09:14.596 --> 09:17.030
I'd lay off competitive
sports for a while.

09:17.031 --> 09:20.400
Sometimes... I get
a little too intense.

09:20.401 --> 09:21.968
Oh. That's cool.

09:21.969 --> 09:24.271
You don't seem like
the Ping-Pong type anyway.

09:24.272 --> 09:26.340
What do you mean?

09:26.341 --> 09:28.275
Well, you're a big guy.

09:28.276 --> 09:30.210
Usually, Ping-Pong players
are quicker.

09:30.211 --> 09:32.579
I'm pretty quick, bro.

09:32.580 --> 09:35.582
I guess I'll just have
to take your word for it.

09:38.419 --> 09:40.520
You know what?
What the hell?

09:40.521 --> 09:42.222
One game won't kill me, huh?

09:42.223 --> 09:44.057
Let's set it up.

09:44.058 --> 09:45.259
Well done, Ryan.

09:45.260 --> 09:46.627
Don't screw it up.

09:46.628 --> 09:48.795
I got this.

09:50.498 --> 09:51.965
(laughing)

09:51.966 --> 09:53.266
Oh, I got lucky.

09:53.267 --> 09:55.068
Yeah, you did.

09:55.069 --> 09:56.502
Get him a body bag!
Yeah!

09:56.503 --> 09:58.003
Wilfy, quiet!

09:59.606 --> 10:01.740
Ryan, serve.

10:01.741 --> 10:03.342
There you are.

10:03.343 --> 10:06.110
- Right on cue.
- Drew, what are you doing?

10:06.111 --> 10:08.546
The show doesn't start
till 3:00, babe. We'll be quick.

10:08.547 --> 10:10.414
- But we had a deal.
- Oh, come on.

10:10.415 --> 10:12.449
It's just a friendly
little game, right, Ryan?

10:12.450 --> 10:14.018
Totally, bro.

10:16.154 --> 10:18.856
Oh, yeah! Get some!

10:18.857 --> 10:20.825
(chuckles) I probably
should have warned you--

10:20.826 --> 10:25.097
back at the break room
at Sheboygan Lager, I was 192-0.

10:29.803 --> 10:31.971
Oh, yeah! 43-43.

10:31.972 --> 10:33.473
- Tied again.
- WILFRED: Bloody hell!

10:33.474 --> 10:35.875
Come on, Drew.
We're already a half hour late.

10:35.876 --> 10:37.877
Okay, can't we just say
that next point wins?

10:37.878 --> 10:39.712
Hey, those
aren't the rules, Jenna.

10:39.713 --> 10:41.280
RYAN: Uh, I think
that's a good idea.

10:41.281 --> 10:43.015
Fine. Whatever.

10:43.016 --> 10:45.317
Your table, your rules.
Next point wins.

10:45.318 --> 10:46.785
I thought you said
you were good.

10:46.786 --> 10:48.053
I've seen more
aggressive ball play

10:48.054 --> 10:49.421
in an airport men's room.

10:49.422 --> 10:52.023
Get your head in the game!

10:57.829 --> 10:59.397
(yells)

10:59.398 --> 11:00.064
No!

11:00.065 --> 11:02.333
Yeah!

11:02.334 --> 11:04.469
Sheboygan Lager, bitch!

11:04.470 --> 11:06.138
That's how we do!

11:06.139 --> 11:09.141
That's... how... we... do!

11:09.142 --> 11:12.144
Yeah! Yeah!

11:12.145 --> 11:13.346
(yelling)

11:16.717 --> 11:18.217
Whoo! (laughs)

11:20.720 --> 11:23.755
(sighs) All right, babe,
let's go see that play.

11:23.756 --> 11:27.124
What?! I'm not going
to the play with you!

11:27.125 --> 11:30.326
I'm not going anywhere
with you, ever again!

11:31.428 --> 11:32.829
Wait, Jenna!

11:38.802 --> 11:42.371
That... was... awesome!

11:42.372 --> 11:44.840
I've never seen Jenna so upset.

11:44.841 --> 11:47.643
You don't think
that pains me, too?

11:47.644 --> 11:50.713
But that's the price we pay
for true love, Ryan.

11:50.714 --> 11:52.915
Now if you'll excuse me,

11:52.916 --> 11:56.751
I'm gonna go tear a new asshole
in the back of Bear's neck.

12:01.890 --> 12:03.423
Hi, Ryan.

12:03.424 --> 12:05.692
Do you wanna come in?

12:05.693 --> 12:07.860
No, thanks.

12:07.861 --> 12:10.129
I'm actually just waiting
for a cab to the airport.

12:11.531 --> 12:13.399
Jenna broke up with me.

12:13.400 --> 12:15.601
Really?

12:15.602 --> 12:17.002
I'm so sorry.

12:17.003 --> 12:18.704
Yeah, uh,

12:18.705 --> 12:22.709
I just wanted
to come over and apologize.

12:22.710 --> 12:25.311
I'm embarrassed.

12:25.312 --> 12:29.883
Well, we both got
a little heated there.

12:29.884 --> 12:32.386
It's like, I know what
I'm doing is wrong,

12:32.387 --> 12:35.022
and I just can't help myself.

12:35.023 --> 12:38.492
Like with that
Milwaukee's Brew guy...

12:38.493 --> 12:43.164
I didn't actually buy him
a Sheboygan Lager.

12:43.165 --> 12:46.200
I bought myself
a Sheboygan Lager.

12:46.201 --> 12:49.336
Then I spit it in his face and
told him to lick my balls.

12:50.705 --> 12:54.008
What's wrong with me?

12:54.009 --> 12:55.242
Something.

12:55.243 --> 12:58.645
Yeah.

12:58.646 --> 13:01.648
And now it cost me the most
important thing in my life.

13:03.218 --> 13:05.819
I just wish
I was more like you.

13:05.820 --> 13:08.188
You seem so...

13:08.189 --> 13:10.824
in control.

13:12.160 --> 13:15.596
Anyway, take care, man.

13:15.597 --> 13:16.797
You, too.

13:18.566 --> 13:20.034
(sighs)

13:25.774 --> 13:30.009
That... was... hilarious!

13:30.010 --> 13:31.377
(laughing)

13:31.378 --> 13:32.545
Did you see how
destroyed he was?

13:32.546 --> 13:36.082
- Uh, yeah. (laughs)
- I feel bad.

13:36.083 --> 13:38.351
That's just your conscience
being a total gaylord.

13:38.352 --> 13:39.552
He's gone, Ryan!

13:39.553 --> 13:41.387
The tyrant is exiled!

13:41.388 --> 13:44.290
He was on the wagon and
we threw him under the bus.

13:44.291 --> 13:46.559
We need to fix this.

13:46.560 --> 13:48.761
The only things
that need fixing are

13:48.762 --> 13:50.362
your tangled transportation
metaphors.

13:50.363 --> 13:52.097
We got exactly what we wanted!

13:52.098 --> 13:54.199
No, you got what you wanted.

13:54.200 --> 13:56.135
You always do this--

13:56.136 --> 14:00.172
you manipulate me and you
don't listen and you push

14:00.173 --> 14:02.041
and push and push

14:02.042 --> 14:04.711
until I finally give in and
do something I know is wrong.

14:04.712 --> 14:06.313
I don't like your tone, Ryan.

14:06.314 --> 14:07.380
Why?

14:07.381 --> 14:08.982
Does it remind you of someone?

14:08.983 --> 14:10.918
You know, you may not
have liked Drew,

14:10.919 --> 14:12.553
but at least you respected him.

14:12.554 --> 14:15.189
Blah, blah, blah. Shut up and
go make yourself a sandwich.

14:15.190 --> 14:16.891
I'm hungry. And this time,
don't put so much--

14:19.261 --> 14:21.128
Did you just...?

14:21.129 --> 14:22.163
You can't just...

14:30.038 --> 14:31.505
All right, Ryan.

14:31.506 --> 14:33.340
Point taken.

14:33.341 --> 14:34.808
(sighs)

14:34.809 --> 14:36.710
I guess you're in charge now.

14:36.711 --> 14:40.247
Yeah, yeah, I guess I am.

14:40.248 --> 14:45.352
So, what, what would
you have me do?

14:45.353 --> 14:48.089
I want you to help me undo
the mess we've made.

14:48.090 --> 14:51.159
That's gonna take some thought.

14:51.160 --> 14:55.097
Um, is it all right with you
if I go and comfort Jenna

14:55.098 --> 14:57.400
while I ruminate on
that subject?

14:57.401 --> 15:00.069
Yeah.

15:00.070 --> 15:02.505
Sure.

15:02.506 --> 15:04.107
May I be excused?

15:13.882 --> 15:16.250
Hi, Jenna, it's Ryan.

15:16.251 --> 15:20.756
Look, I'd really like to talk
about what happened with Drew.

15:20.757 --> 15:22.758
Give me a call back
when you get a chance.

15:38.240 --> 15:40.041
(ringtone playing)

15:42.043 --> 15:43.610
Hello?

15:43.611 --> 15:45.111
WILFRED: Hello, Ryan.

15:45.112 --> 15:47.314
Wilfred, what's going on?

15:47.315 --> 15:49.916
Just calling to see if you'd
followed your conscience yet.

15:49.917 --> 15:52.019
Any luck getting Drew and Jenna
back together?

15:52.020 --> 15:53.254
I'm working on it.

15:53.255 --> 15:54.222
Oh, good!

15:54.223 --> 15:57.225
I'm very happy for you.

15:57.226 --> 15:59.227
Too bad you won't be around
to see it.

15:59.228 --> 16:00.629
What are you talking about?

16:00.630 --> 16:02.631
Did you enjoy
your brownie, Ryan?

16:02.632 --> 16:04.933
What? How did you know it--

16:04.934 --> 16:06.802
I made it just for you.

16:06.803 --> 16:08.838
I hope you like
my secret ingredient.

16:08.839 --> 16:09.939
What did you put in it?

16:09.940 --> 16:11.307
Oh, nothing really.

16:11.308 --> 16:13.576
Just a powerful neurotoxin

16:13.577 --> 16:16.246
that is coursing through
your bloodstream as we speak.

16:16.247 --> 16:18.215
What?

16:18.216 --> 16:20.117
Did you really think
I'd give up my alpha status

16:20.118 --> 16:21.519
without a fight?

16:21.520 --> 16:24.455
I wonder what
your outlook is, Ryan.

16:24.456 --> 16:27.592
"All signs point to...

16:27.593 --> 16:29.660
dead!"

16:29.661 --> 16:30.795
(laughs maniacally)

16:32.931 --> 16:34.232
(laughing continues)

16:34.233 --> 16:35.733
Where are you?

16:35.734 --> 16:37.301
I'll never tell! (laughs)

16:37.302 --> 16:40.271
And if you think you'll find me,

16:40.272 --> 16:42.507
then you've vastly
underestimated the depth

16:42.508 --> 16:44.876
of my brilliantly...
Oh, hey, Ryan.

16:44.877 --> 16:46.244
What's all this about poison?

16:46.245 --> 16:47.545
I didn't manipulate you

16:47.546 --> 16:48.847
into getting rid of Drew

16:48.848 --> 16:51.316
just to let your
conscience screw it up.

16:51.317 --> 16:54.086
<i>I had to poison you.</i>

16:54.087 --> 16:55.554
I don't believe you.

16:55.555 --> 16:57.489
I don't believe
you'd do that to me.

16:57.490 --> 17:00.459
That's just the neurotoxin

17:00.460 --> 17:02.194
eating away at the part

17:02.195 --> 17:03.395
of your brain that allows
you to believe things.

17:03.396 --> 17:04.896
Are you feeling weak?

17:04.896 --> 17:06.664
Is your heart racing?

17:06.665 --> 17:10.367
Is your mouth getting dry?

17:10.368 --> 17:16.007
You think you're more powerful
than me, don't you, Ryan?

17:16.008 --> 17:20.579
Well, I have news for you!

17:20.579 --> 17:22.481
- Give me that!
- Never!

17:22.482 --> 17:25.317
But I will let you have it!

17:25.318 --> 17:26.452
(both grunting)

17:30.456 --> 17:32.023
(chemicals hissing)

17:32.024 --> 17:34.692
(Ryan grunting, groans loudly)

17:36.962 --> 17:38.630
(both coughing)

17:42.902 --> 17:45.837
RYAN: Are you all right?

17:45.838 --> 17:49.340
You... saved me.

17:49.341 --> 17:52.877
Why did you save me?

17:52.878 --> 17:54.713
It was the right thing to do.

17:54.714 --> 17:57.849
After everything I did to you?

17:57.850 --> 18:01.920
I will never understand humans.

18:01.921 --> 18:04.723
But this is the reason why we
will ultimately defeat you.

18:04.724 --> 18:06.091
Wilfred, focus.

18:06.092 --> 18:07.560
What did you poison me with?

18:07.561 --> 18:09.729
Theobromine.

18:09.730 --> 18:11.231
Oh, my God!

18:11.232 --> 18:12.732
You've heard of it?

18:12.733 --> 18:14.267
No, but it sounds terrible.

18:14.268 --> 18:15.836
I still can't believe
you poisoned me.

18:15.837 --> 18:17.270
I still can't believe

18:17.271 --> 18:19.173
you bopped me on the nose
with a newspaper.

18:19.174 --> 18:20.708
Bopped, Ryan!

18:20.709 --> 18:23.244
I never wanted to dominate you.

18:23.245 --> 18:25.046
I just didn't wanna be
dominated by you.

18:25.047 --> 18:26.681
Oh.

18:26.682 --> 18:29.149
(coughs)

18:29.150 --> 18:30.984
If I make it through this,

18:30.985 --> 18:33.353
I'm gonna start
listening to my gut more,

18:33.354 --> 18:34.988
and you're just gonna
have to accept that.

18:34.989 --> 18:36.422
Understood, mate.

18:36.423 --> 18:37.990
Hell, maybe you're
onto something

18:37.991 --> 18:39.925
with all this conscience stuff.

18:39.926 --> 18:42.061
I'm even starting to think
I should stop doing

18:42.062 --> 18:43.729
that god-awful thing
to your mouth guard.

18:43.730 --> 18:45.230
- What thing? What did you do?
- Shhh.

18:45.231 --> 18:48.233
Conserve your energy, mate.

18:48.234 --> 18:50.802
WOMAN (over P.A.):
Dr. Kakel, call the operator.

18:50.803 --> 18:52.638
Well, it looks like you're okay,
Mr. Newman.

18:52.639 --> 18:54.340
Your blood tests showed
zero toxicity.

18:54.341 --> 18:57.343
But I ingested a large quantity
of theobromine.

18:57.344 --> 18:59.846
So did I, at lunch,
when I had a Hershey bar.

18:59.847 --> 19:01.547
Theobromine's just a chemical
found in chocolate.

19:01.548 --> 19:03.115
So, it's not poisonous?

19:03.116 --> 19:05.584
Only if you're a dog.

19:05.585 --> 19:07.286
Chocolate?

19:07.287 --> 19:09.388
Ask him about the raisins.

19:09.389 --> 19:10.589
I put raisins in there, too.

19:15.309 --> 19:16.576
Well, it's official,

19:16.577 --> 19:17.910
Jenna forgave Drew.

19:17.911 --> 19:19.913
They're back together.

19:19.914 --> 19:22.715
I'm sorry to hear that, Ryan.

19:22.716 --> 19:25.285
I'm sorry for both of us.

19:25.286 --> 19:26.653
If it's any consolation,

19:26.654 --> 19:28.789
I promise not to try
to kill you again.

19:28.790 --> 19:32.894
I appreciate that.

19:32.895 --> 19:36.498
I wouldn't drink
that if I was you.

19:36.499 --> 19:39.301
I'll get you a fresh beer.

19:40.805 --> 19:43.006
I'll just pour this one out.

19:44.975 --> 19:46.776
(slapping sound)

19:46.777 --> 19:48.144
Ah! Ah!

19:48.145 --> 19:52.748
Ah...!

19:53.817 --> 19:55.717
Ah!

19:55.718 --> 19:58.020
(groans)

20:01.024 --> 20:04.493
(groaning)

20:10.266 --> 20:13.502
What's wrong, mate?

20:13.903 --> 20:16.138
I'm still thinking about Jenna.

20:20.512 --> 20:23.280
I know what'll cheer you up.

20:23.281 --> 20:24.782
Bear, come here.

20:24.783 --> 20:27.083
I want you to meet
my friend Ryan.
