00:00.124 --> 00:01.773
<i>Growing up in the 80s, my mom</i>

00:01.893 --> 00:03.123
loved her kids more than anything,

00:03.227 --> 00:05.395
<i>which made every goodbye utter agony.</i>

00:05.429 --> 00:07.764
<i>So, dropping my big bro
and sis off at college</i>

00:07.830 --> 00:10.233
<i>was bound to be a tsunami of sadness.</i>

00:10.267 --> 00:11.901
<i>My dad, on the other hand...</i>

00:11.935 --> 00:13.336
Okay, morons, out ya go.

00:13.370 --> 00:14.604
They're not morons.

00:14.672 --> 00:16.406
They're our baby birds leaving the nest,

00:16.440 --> 00:18.007
and they are very upset about it.

00:18.042 --> 00:21.411
My four-year bender of
unsupervised partying starts now!

00:21.445 --> 00:23.346
Dad, you're not even stopping the car!

00:23.380 --> 00:25.715
I'm basically stopped!
Come on! Go, go, go!

00:25.749 --> 00:27.216
This feels very unsafe.

00:27.251 --> 00:29.118
For God's sake, Murray, stop the car.

00:29.186 --> 00:30.953
There's nowhere to stop!

00:31.021 --> 00:33.122
The man in the orange "welcome"
vest is guiding you to a spot!

00:33.190 --> 00:34.957
- Damn it, Murray, now!
- Fine!

00:36.360 --> 00:39.095
Okay, you got 20 seconds.
That's 10 per kid.

00:39.129 --> 00:40.730
I know how many children we have.

00:42.466 --> 00:43.700
Where do you think you're going?

00:43.734 --> 00:45.868
- To say goodbye to the love of my life.
- Uh-uh.

00:45.903 --> 00:48.371
I'm sorry, Mr. G, but it is
time for me to stand up to you

00:48.405 --> 00:50.039
and prove that I've
finally become a man.

00:51.208 --> 00:52.942
Oh, no! He kid-locked me in!

00:52.976 --> 00:55.278
Okay, I've prepared a lengthy

00:55.312 --> 00:57.547
and emotionally explosive speech.

00:57.581 --> 00:59.148
Mom, if you make a scene,

00:59.216 --> 01:00.450
I will never come home again.

01:00.484 --> 01:01.784
Ditto.

01:01.819 --> 01:03.486
So, keep it together,
lady. Not a single tear.

01:03.554 --> 01:06.122
Children, fruit of my loins,

01:06.156 --> 01:08.124
like the spongy umbilical cord

01:08.158 --> 01:10.126
that once bound our bodies together.

01:10.160 --> 01:11.227
Whatever she's saying, me, too!

01:12.162 --> 01:13.663
Erica, I wish you the best.

01:13.731 --> 01:14.831
Too long.

01:14.898 --> 01:16.332
<i>Barry, I bid you adieu, mon ami.</i>

01:16.400 --> 01:18.401
<i>A Billy Idol Mony Mony to you, too.</i>

01:18.435 --> 01:20.837
Might I impose upon each
of you for a small kiss?

01:20.904 --> 01:22.772
No kisses!

01:22.806 --> 01:24.307
Get back in the car!

01:24.341 --> 01:26.275
All right, Murray, you animal!

01:27.778 --> 01:29.278
Farewell.

01:33.083 --> 01:34.817
Huh. She actually kept it all together.

01:34.852 --> 01:36.119
I'm pleasantly shocked.

01:36.153 --> 01:37.987
Oh, no.

01:38.021 --> 01:39.455
I knew she couldn't
fight her excessive love!

01:39.490 --> 01:40.757
She's garbage!

01:40.791 --> 01:42.125
Erica, you forgot your Caboodle!

01:42.159 --> 01:43.092
Just toss it out.

01:44.795 --> 01:46.529
- Oh, no!
- Hey, Schwartz, head in.

01:46.597 --> 01:47.930
Dad, you'll hurt him!

01:47.965 --> 01:49.599
Window's going up!

01:49.633 --> 01:51.801
I'll miss you so much! Ow! This
is not the goodbye I imagined!

You just got owned by

Welcome to freshman year, Goldnerd.

02:21.064 --> 02:22.632
Yeah, I'm not a freshman, Johnny.

02:22.666 --> 02:23.833
Probably just seems that way

02:23.867 --> 02:24.801
because you're a third-year senior.

02:25.669 --> 02:27.837
Gah! What was that for?

02:27.871 --> 02:30.206
Johnny doesn't like to take
inventory of his life's missteps.

Big Dave Kim! How was your summer?

02:43.587 --> 02:44.821
His summer was uneventful,

02:44.855 --> 02:46.389
and he's talking to me right now.

02:46.423 --> 02:48.391
Oh, wow. You guys are still, uh...

02:48.425 --> 02:49.559
I can't explain it, either.

02:49.593 --> 02:51.093
Carla, I thought you graduated?

02:51.161 --> 02:53.262
She did. Now she works at Wingin' It.

02:53.330 --> 02:56.265
Dave Kim's lady brings home
the bacon and the chicken.

02:56.333 --> 02:58.434
The bacon is money, but
the chicken is chicken.

02:58.502 --> 03:01.237
Adam, I think you know Brian McMahon?

03:01.271 --> 03:02.672
You and Shy Bri?

03:02.706 --> 03:04.739
- 'Sup?
- That's his catch phrase.

03:04.774 --> 03:05.441
'Sup?

03:05.509 --> 03:07.877
Seems like it's pretty
much his only phrase.

03:07.911 --> 03:09.946
Anyway, maybe we can all
hang out after school?

03:10.013 --> 03:12.281
Sorry, bro, we got group couples' plans.

03:12.349 --> 03:13.716
Oh, balls!

03:13.750 --> 03:16.118
Everyone's in the throes
of love except for me?

03:16.186 --> 03:18.254
- Uh-huh. 
- Okay, settle down, Shy Bri!

03:18.288 --> 03:19.422
Well, we should go.

03:19.456 --> 03:20.623
We're all gonna walk to class together

03:20.691 --> 03:21.958
as one even-numbered group.

03:22.025 --> 03:24.560
He seems disappointed, as
if this was the opposite

03:24.595 --> 03:26.095
of how he expected his day to go.

03:28.065 --> 03:30.967

03:34.538 --> 03:35.771
All right, listen up, people!

03:35.806 --> 03:38.407
Unless you also had a
cat with a prolapsed anus

03:38.442 --> 03:41.811
that requires a special salve
applied directly to the area,

03:41.879 --> 03:43.813
I promise you had a
better summer than I.

03:43.881 --> 03:45.982
So, in the spirit of
taking it out on you...

03:46.049 --> 03:48.484
Pop quiz!

03:48.552 --> 03:50.620
<i>Just when it looked like the

03:55.659 --> 03:58.461

<i>and of course, first kiss.</i>

04:04.268 --> 04:05.334
Hi, Adam.

04:06.136 --> 04:08.104
Dana, You're... Here?

04:08.138 --> 04:09.505
My grandma passed away.

04:09.573 --> 04:11.507
There was nothing keeping
us in Seattle, so...

04:11.575 --> 04:14.076
Well, I guess your loss is my gain.

04:14.111 --> 04:15.778
But also... Sorry for your loss.

04:15.812 --> 04:18.247
Hey, New Girl! They don't
have first-day pop quizzes

04:18.281 --> 04:19.615
wherever the freak you come from?

04:19.649 --> 04:20.983
Sit down, shut up, and start guessing.

04:21.017 --> 04:23.586
<i>As I couldn't believe Dana was back,</i>

04:23.620 --> 04:26.088
<i>Barry couldn't believe

04:31.461 --> 04:33.095
- Yep.
- Barry Goldberg.

04:33.130 --> 04:34.497
Friends call me Big Tasty.

04:34.531 --> 04:36.933
Gary Silverberg, AKA G-Licious.

04:36.967 --> 04:39.335
We seem well-matched, but
tell me, do you know karate?

04:39.369 --> 04:40.803
Yaah!

04:40.837 --> 04:42.805
I'll take that as a destructive yes.

04:42.839 --> 04:45.608
And I, uh, see you have turntables, too?

04:45.642 --> 04:48.811
Yep, but I am still looking for
an MC to spit some fiery rhymes.

04:48.845 --> 04:52.882

05:09.666 --> 05:11.300
Picked it? They were assigned.

05:16.640 --> 05:19.241

05:19.309 --> 05:22.578
How dare you shatter my wildly
self-destructive college dreams

05:22.646 --> 05:24.046
by not sending in my housing check?

05:24.081 --> 05:26.248
Uh, no, my volatile love monkey.

05:26.316 --> 05:27.883
I definitely sent it in.

05:27.918 --> 05:29.318
Well, guess who doesn't have housing.

05:29.353 --> 05:30.720

05:30.754 --> 05:32.888
Is here okay for all your

05:32.923 --> 05:35.427
- Upstairs in my room.
- On it, sweetie.

05:37.527 --> 05:39.595
Why do I still see morons?

05:39.663 --> 05:42.498
'Cause your unstable wife didn't
send in our checks for student housing

05:42.532 --> 05:45.434
- so she can keep us at home.
- But I swear I sent them in.

05:45.502 --> 05:48.170

spittin' fresh flows

05:48.205 --> 05:50.873

05:52.843 --> 05:54.610
He's freaking out, but I'm not.

05:54.678 --> 05:56.445
Now that I have a
second chance at college,

05:56.513 --> 05:58.547
I will not let you
ruin this year for me.

05:58.582 --> 06:00.383
I'll be upstairs studying.

06:00.417 --> 06:03.219
Do not expect that measured,
mature reaction from me.

06:03.253 --> 06:05.521
But I didn't do what you're saying.

06:05.555 --> 06:07.790
Unless... Oh, God.

06:07.858 --> 06:10.426
Is my mom brain so strong,
I did it subconsciously?

06:10.460 --> 06:11.961
Is that even possible?

06:12.029 --> 06:13.396
I'd say probable.

06:13.430 --> 06:15.031

You did the bad thing.

06:24.107 --> 06:26.442

06:26.476 --> 06:27.710
Come on!

06:27.744 --> 06:29.311
Let's get together and gum ball it up.

06:29.379 --> 06:30.813
Gum balls?

06:30.881 --> 06:32.882
I'm in real trouble over here,

06:32.916 --> 06:34.917
and this guy's talking about gum balls?

06:34.951 --> 06:36.652
Mother, you need to fix this now!

06:36.720 --> 06:38.120
I will, Schmoo.

06:38.155 --> 06:40.322

06:40.390 --> 06:42.158
We're both leaving right now.

06:42.225 --> 06:45.961
Mur, I'm not sure you're reading
the room with all the puzzle talk.

06:45.996 --> 06:48.097
So, the kids live at
home a little longer.

06:48.131 --> 06:49.899
What's the big whoop?

06:49.933 --> 06:53.135
Big whoop? You've wanted
those kids outta here forever.

06:53.170 --> 06:56.472
- I've got a hunch you're up to something.
- Me?

06:56.506 --> 06:57.807
What could I be up to?

06:57.841 --> 07:00.776
I don't know, but I'm
gonna solve this puzzle,

07:00.811 --> 07:03.512
right after I solve this puzzle.

07:03.580 --> 07:05.748
<i>While Pops was busy
putting the pieces together,</i>

07:05.782 --> 07:08.084
<i>there was only one piece

07:08.118 --> 07:13.956
- So, are you single?
- Definitely. Yes. You?

07:13.990 --> 07:15.024
Oh, big time.

07:15.092 --> 07:16.926
Oh, thank God.

07:16.960 --> 07:18.594
I was so worried you were
gonna be seeing someone.

07:18.628 --> 07:20.129
- You were?
- Yeah,

07:20.163 --> 07:21.464
'cause then I wouldn't
be able to hang out

07:21.498 --> 07:22.631
with my one friend that I had here.

07:22.666 --> 07:25.000
- Oh...
- I mean, it's so weird.

07:25.035 --> 07:26.302
Everyone looks familiar,

07:26.336 --> 07:27.870
but I don't really know anyone.

07:27.938 --> 07:29.472
Luckily, I have a friend like you.

07:29.506 --> 07:31.040
Yup. I am a friend like me.

07:31.108 --> 07:32.942
Just put it there, pal.

07:32.976 --> 07:35.878
Come on. We're closer
friends than that. Oh.

07:35.946 --> 07:37.179
I'll see you after school.

07:40.050 --> 07:41.784
So, when are you gonna lock that down?

07:41.818 --> 07:43.152
You've gotten very aggressive

07:43.186 --> 07:44.220
since Carla came into your life.

07:44.287 --> 07:45.521
She likes me sassy,

07:45.555 --> 07:47.289
but this is an incredible
opportunity for you.

07:47.324 --> 07:48.390
Don't you like her?

07:48.458 --> 07:50.025
Of course I like her, Dave Kim.

07:50.060 --> 07:53.062
But now she's super cool and kind
of looks like a flight attendant,

07:53.130 --> 07:54.730
and I'm still me.

07:54.798 --> 07:56.532
Plus, she told me she
just wants to be friends.

07:56.566 --> 07:58.801
Friends? I saw the way she hugged you!

07:58.835 --> 08:01.070
<i>I thought I was watching

08:01.138 --> 08:03.405
<i>You've seen the kink
noir drama 9 1/2 Weeks?</i>

08:03.473 --> 08:05.741
I'm in a relationship
with an adult lady,

08:05.809 --> 08:08.244
and that lady is stealing
cable from her neighbor.

08:08.311 --> 08:11.180
You know, she did lightly tap
my upper back when we hugged.

08:11.214 --> 08:12.815
<i>I know. It was like Body Heat,</i>

08:12.849 --> 08:14.316
which I also watched and enjoyed.

08:14.351 --> 08:16.018
Dana coming back is fate telling me

08:16.052 --> 08:17.553
that this year won't
be a lonely suck-show.

08:17.587 --> 08:19.221
This is your time, man!

08:19.256 --> 08:20.556
But you gotta get in there quick.

08:20.590 --> 08:22.324
Look, jocks are swooping.

08:24.594 --> 08:26.929
Oh, no! Those are varsity athletes!

08:26.997 --> 08:29.031
That's the high school
equivalent of adult men!

08:29.065 --> 08:31.867
And in the case of Johnny
Atkins, an actual adult man!

08:31.902 --> 08:33.402
Yo, Goldnerd,

08:33.436 --> 08:35.538
you know that new old
girl, Dana Caldwell?

08:35.572 --> 08:37.239
Rumor has it you have shared history.

08:37.274 --> 08:38.541
Yeah, but we're just friends.

08:38.575 --> 08:39.707
Noice.

08:39.743 --> 08:40.775
Not that I need your approval

08:40.844 --> 08:42.443
or respect your feelings,

08:42.511 --> 08:45.047
but you should know I'm
lasering in on her romantically.

08:45.081 --> 08:47.950
Me, too, bro. Lasering big time.

08:48.018 --> 08:51.020
Dude, if my relationship with
Carla has taught me anything,

08:51.054 --> 08:52.588
it's that you've got to be decisive.

08:52.622 --> 08:53.722
So, what do I do?

08:53.757 --> 08:55.391
Ask her to the Aloha Dance.

08:55.425 --> 08:57.193
It's the most important tropical

08:57.227 --> 08:59.628
welcome-back-to-school,
Hawaiian-themed dance of them all.

08:59.696 --> 09:01.764
<i>As I was wondering
if Dave Kim was right,</i>

09:01.798 --> 09:04.433
<i>my mom was determined
to fix a terrible wrong.</i>

09:04.467 --> 09:05.534
Hi, Dean Dean.

09:05.569 --> 09:06.702
Beverly Goldberg.

09:06.736 --> 09:08.137
Not Dean Dean.

09:08.205 --> 09:10.806
Just a man named Dean
who... Happens to be a dean.

09:10.874 --> 09:14.443
Dean Dean, these are the housing
checks for Barry and Erica Goldberg.

09:14.477 --> 09:17.746
Make sure Barry's room is no further
than 30 feet from the bathroom.

09:17.781 --> 09:19.281
He's got a bit of a fussy tummy.

09:19.316 --> 09:21.317
Well, wait, these were due months ago.

09:21.384 --> 09:23.052
Which is when my conscious
mind sent them in.

09:23.086 --> 09:24.887
Your conscious mind?

09:24.921 --> 09:28.257
Oh, it's a teeny possibility that my
subconscious mind did not send them in.

09:28.291 --> 09:29.758
So, you didn't send them in?

09:29.793 --> 09:31.660
Or it's also a teeny possibility

09:31.728 --> 09:34.496
that your conscious
mind received the checks,

09:34.564 --> 09:37.967
but that your subconscious
mind destroyed them.

09:38.001 --> 09:39.602
- Why would it do that?
- I don't know.

09:39.636 --> 09:42.238
Why would a man named Dean
seek out a career in deaning?

09:43.673 --> 09:45.941
We can't control our
subconscious minds, Dean Dean.

09:45.976 --> 09:47.977
The point is, I forgive you.

09:48.011 --> 09:49.745
- Have a great year.
- Well, wait.

09:49.779 --> 09:52.248
To the extent that I believed
or understood anything you said,

09:52.282 --> 09:54.416
uh, the dorm rooms are all full now.

09:54.451 --> 09:56.518
So, there's nothing I can do.

09:56.586 --> 09:59.121
This will be the first of
many times you say that to me,

09:59.155 --> 10:01.257
and the first of many
times I won't listen.

10:02.459 --> 10:04.293
There may be something I can do.

10:07.631 --> 10:09.298
It's nacho time.

10:09.332 --> 10:10.532
Wait, you made food?

10:10.600 --> 10:12.501
- For us?
- What's your game, man?

10:12.535 --> 10:15.204
Can't a man make a traditional
Mexican snack for his kids?

10:15.272 --> 10:16.972
Oh, no!

10:17.007 --> 10:19.174
Those aren't beans! What's in my mouth?

10:19.209 --> 10:20.943
I don't know. I just got
a can out of the pantry.

10:20.977 --> 10:22.478
I think those are whole cranberries.

10:22.512 --> 10:23.946
Cranberries?

10:23.980 --> 10:26.181
The Mexican people don't
work with tart bog fruit!

10:26.216 --> 10:27.349
What did you do?

10:27.384 --> 10:28.884
Just eat around the bog fruit!

10:28.952 --> 10:31.553
Schmoopies, Mama solved
your housing crisis.

10:31.621 --> 10:32.521
- Oh! Thank God.
- Yes!

10:32.555 --> 10:33.856
How?

10:33.890 --> 10:35.391
Dean Dean found some
openings with a few freshman

10:35.458 --> 10:37.459
whose roommates didn't
take to them. Yay!

10:37.494 --> 10:39.495
Wait, why didn't their
roommates take to them?

10:39.529 --> 10:42.298
<i>Turns out, there wasn't one reason.</i>

10:42.332 --> 10:44.199
<i>There were these two dummies,</i>

10:44.234 --> 10:45.901
<i>and this shy fellow,</i>

10:45.969 --> 10:47.503
<i>and this delicate lady,</i>

10:47.537 --> 10:49.672
and whatever's going on here,

10:49.706 --> 10:52.675
<i>and we never got a good
look at this guy or gal.</i>

10:52.709 --> 10:53.809
We're screwed, aren't we?

10:53.843 --> 10:55.144
You're screwed.

10:55.178 --> 10:57.313
I have a back-up plan
that for sure can't fail.

10:58.014 --> 10:59.548
Gary! Help!

10:59.582 --> 11:00.716
You got to take me back!

11:00.750 --> 11:02.084
I'll do anything.

11:03.420 --> 11:04.586
- Hyah!
- Hyah!

11:04.654 --> 11:06.255
- Ohh!
- Hyah!

11:06.323 --> 11:08.390
No!

11:09.297 --> 11:12.399
<i>My former flame had returned!
So, to win her heart,</i>

11:12.467 --> 11:14.468
<i>I turned to the biggest
ladies' man I knew.</i>

11:14.502 --> 11:16.136
Pops, Dana Caldwell's back,

11:16.171 --> 11:18.072
and I gotta ask her to
the Aloha Dance fast.

11:18.139 --> 11:19.740
But I feel like I need a game plan. Go.

11:19.808 --> 11:21.508
Kiddo, why the urgency?

11:21.543 --> 11:23.410
'Cause meatheads are swooping!

11:23.478 --> 11:24.978
Eh, let 'em swoop.

11:25.013 --> 11:26.747
Just ask her as a friend,

11:26.815 --> 11:28.982
then slowly over time,
you'll get her back.

11:29.017 --> 11:31.251
You know, my gut was
telling me to take it slow.

11:31.319 --> 11:32.720
Your gut is an idiot.

11:32.754 --> 11:35.022
- Gah!
- You need to rush things with Dana.

11:35.056 --> 11:36.757
Rush 'em hard.

11:36.825 --> 11:40.094
Barry, don't do the thing where
you contradict my sensible advice.

11:40.161 --> 11:41.762
Okay, Pops is out of his mind.

11:41.830 --> 11:43.230
You must go for it now.

11:43.264 --> 11:44.498
And here we go.

11:44.532 --> 11:46.200
Dana was your first crush.

11:46.234 --> 11:47.835
Do you know how rare it is

11:47.869 --> 11:49.603
to get a second chance at love?

11:49.671 --> 11:50.838
Pretty rare?

11:50.872 --> 11:53.073
It's literally never happened before.

11:53.108 --> 11:55.509
Please, just listen to your gut.

11:55.543 --> 11:58.412
But I can't hear it over Barry's
loud, yet compelling advice.

11:58.446 --> 12:01.181
I had a similar experience where
it was so perfect with someone,

12:01.216 --> 12:02.282
but I couldn't make it work.

12:02.350 --> 12:03.884
I regret it to this day.

12:03.918 --> 12:05.919
It wasn't your fault. Lainey
moved away to do music.

12:05.954 --> 12:07.287
No, not Lainey.

12:07.355 --> 12:08.756
I'm talking about Gary.

12:08.790 --> 12:10.591
How am I losing to this guy?

12:10.625 --> 12:13.060
You need to make a
giant romantic gesture

12:13.094 --> 12:15.629
that reminds her of
your lame shared history.

12:15.697 --> 12:18.132
I will, and your passion
makes me certain it'll work.

12:18.199 --> 12:19.466
And I'm certain of it,

12:19.534 --> 12:21.735
but it needs to be big and over the top.

12:21.770 --> 12:23.637
I'm gonna go get my girlfriend back!

12:24.973 --> 12:26.707
It's a good thing I was here.

12:26.741 --> 12:28.575
<i>While I was excited to win Dana back,</i>

12:28.610 --> 12:31.612
<i>my mom was trying hard not
to lose her children forever.</i>

12:31.646 --> 12:34.314
Okay, I've got some fantastic news.

12:34.382 --> 12:35.949
Flavor Overdrive died
and I can stop living

12:35.984 --> 12:37.317
in this well-appointed
suburban hellhole?

12:37.385 --> 12:38.986
Even better.

12:39.053 --> 12:42.389
I thought of ways to make this
hellhole a lot more tolerable.

12:43.658 --> 12:45.759
Erica, I read and highlighted

12:45.794 --> 12:48.162
chapter four of your sociology book.

12:48.229 --> 12:50.731
What? I was licking my
chops to get to that chapter!

12:50.765 --> 12:52.132
I guess I'll go read chapter five.

12:52.167 --> 12:55.836
And, Barry, look at this
adorable toga I made for you.

12:55.904 --> 12:57.271
All right, enough!

12:57.305 --> 12:59.840
You ruined my college dreams
just to keep us near you,

12:59.908 --> 13:01.008
but it's not gonna work.

13:01.075 --> 13:02.776
I refuse to be in the same room as you.

13:03.945 --> 13:05.145
Barry, get back here.

13:05.180 --> 13:06.313
Nope!

13:06.347 --> 13:07.581
Fine, I'll just go down there.

13:07.615 --> 13:09.183
Oh, then I'll be in here.

13:09.250 --> 13:10.918
Okay, this is ridiculous.

13:10.952 --> 13:13.253
Barry, you cannot avoid me.

13:13.288 --> 13:14.421
<i>But he did.</i>

13:14.455 --> 13:16.924
<i>He went to this room,
and then that room,</i>

13:16.958 --> 13:18.992
<i>and back to this room,
and that room again,</i>

13:19.027 --> 13:20.294
<i>and for some reason, back to this room,</i>

13:20.328 --> 13:21.595
<i>and here again.</i>

13:21.629 --> 13:23.964
This went on for 12
minutes until, finally...

13:23.998 --> 13:25.165
I mean it.

13:25.200 --> 13:27.334
You will never again have the experience

13:27.368 --> 13:29.169
of being in the same room as me.

13:29.204 --> 13:30.504
What if we're at a family wedding?

13:30.538 --> 13:32.105
I will dance and eat the
meal in the men's room.

13:32.140 --> 13:33.307
What about a museum?

13:33.341 --> 13:34.675
Unlikely, since I have no interest

13:34.709 --> 13:35.876
in history or art of any kind.

13:35.944 --> 13:37.311
Fallout shelter?

13:37.345 --> 13:39.980
I will train my body to
survive a nuclear explosion.

13:40.014 --> 13:41.181
What about my funeral?

13:41.216 --> 13:42.716
I will give a dominant eulogy...

13:42.784 --> 13:44.184
Oh, thank God.

13:44.219 --> 13:47.354
...on a video monitor from
an undisclosed location.

13:47.388 --> 13:49.990
<i>While Barry was ending his
relationship with my mom,</i>

13:50.024 --> 13:52.726
<i>I had the perfect plan to
kick-start mine with Dana</i>

13:52.794 --> 13:54.561
<i>and overwhelm her with our history.</i>

13:54.629 --> 13:58.565
<i>There were rings and
songs and, oddly, a baby</i>

13:58.633 --> 14:01.668
and battle gear for a warrior
fighting to win back his love.

14:01.703 --> 14:02.803
This feels right.

14:06.641 --> 14:07.875
- Adam?
- Yep.

14:07.909 --> 14:11.044
And former Genesis
front man Peter Gabriel.

14:11.079 --> 14:12.646
Damn it. Batteries.

14:12.680 --> 14:14.548
<i>Okay, imagine In Your Eyes is playing</i>

14:14.582 --> 14:15.749
as I present to you...

14:15.817 --> 14:17.184
Laser tag.

14:17.218 --> 14:18.719
Is that the baby we took care of?

14:18.753 --> 14:20.520
"Hi, Mommy. I wuv you."

14:21.656 --> 14:22.723
Okay, that's weird.

14:22.757 --> 14:23.924
All of this is weird.

14:23.992 --> 14:25.259
Why is it happening?

14:25.326 --> 14:27.361
Eh... You know what? Hang
on. I'll be right out.

14:27.395 --> 14:28.762
Oh, no. Stay put.

14:28.830 --> 14:31.665
I come to you via trellis.

14:31.699 --> 14:32.933
<i>This was it.</i>

14:33.001 --> 14:35.535
<i>Just like old times,
I'd climb Dana's trellis</i>

14:35.570 --> 14:37.437
for an epic romantic gesture.

14:37.505 --> 14:39.039
<i>It was my second chance at love,</i>

14:39.073 --> 14:41.341
<i>and I was sure it would
be twice as magical.</i>

14:41.376 --> 14:43.343
Dana Caldwell, would you...

14:43.378 --> 14:44.344
Uh-oh.

14:44.746 --> 14:46.079
Ahh!

14:46.114 --> 14:47.781
Adam!

14:47.849 --> 14:49.883
<i>Unfortunately, I didn't
realize I was twice as big.</i>

14:49.918 --> 14:51.551
Adam!

14:51.586 --> 14:53.253
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

14:53.288 --> 14:55.188
- What's going on?
- I can fix your trellis.

14:55.223 --> 14:56.890
Full disclosure, I can't.

14:56.925 --> 14:58.792
And what's with all
this stuff from our past?

14:58.860 --> 15:00.794
I'm reminding you of our shared history,

15:00.862 --> 15:02.763
to grease the wheels for
asking you to the Aloha Dance.

15:03.698 --> 15:05.132
Are you serious right now?

15:05.199 --> 15:06.533
Huh.

15:06.567 --> 15:08.902
Not the kind of question to
fill a guy with confidence.

15:08.937 --> 15:11.872
I guess I thought we could
start going out again.

15:11.906 --> 15:13.073
What do you say?

15:14.142 --> 15:15.275
I say no.

15:16.277 --> 15:18.045
See you later, Adam.

15:18.079 --> 15:19.479
Wait, wait, wait.

15:19.547 --> 15:22.082
- Tell me what's wrong.
- Everything, Adam.

15:22.116 --> 15:24.051
I just left my home and my life

15:24.085 --> 15:26.653
and moved back to a place
I haven't lived in years.

15:26.721 --> 15:29.990
And the one person I thought was
my friend couldn't even be that.

15:32.160 --> 15:35.062
<i>While my second chance at love
with Dana came crashing down,</i>

15:35.096 --> 15:36.496
<i>my mom was spinning out.</i>

15:36.564 --> 15:38.999
So, my son is gonna melt
in a nuclear disaster,

15:39.067 --> 15:40.267
and what's worse is,

15:40.301 --> 15:42.469
now he refuses to attend my funeral.

15:43.271 --> 15:44.838
Help me, Dean Dean.

15:44.906 --> 15:47.474
As I've been trying to tell
you since the museum part,

15:47.508 --> 15:49.509
housing became available
for your children.

15:49.577 --> 15:50.777
It did?

15:50.812 --> 15:52.346
Yes, and when I called to tell you,

15:52.413 --> 15:53.814
your husband said "No, thanks."

15:53.848 --> 15:57.150
Are you [BLEEP] [BLEEP]
with me right now?

15:57.185 --> 15:58.485
It was you.

15:58.519 --> 16:01.021
You're the one that
caused this whole mess.

16:01.089 --> 16:02.155
- What?
- That's right.

16:02.190 --> 16:04.424
Per Dean Dean, housing became available,

16:04.459 --> 16:07.661
- which your father refused.
- Is that true, Dad?

16:07.695 --> 16:09.129
Maybe.

16:09.163 --> 16:10.163
What?

16:10.198 --> 16:11.765
Yes.

16:11.799 --> 16:13.300
Are you saying "yes"?

16:13.334 --> 16:14.701
Maybe.

16:14.769 --> 16:16.536
- What?
- Yes.

16:16.604 --> 16:18.138
He's talking so softly,

16:18.172 --> 16:19.973
it's imperceptible to human ears.

16:20.008 --> 16:21.775
I must know the truth.

16:21.809 --> 16:23.543
- Maybe.
- Damn it, Murray,

16:23.611 --> 16:26.646
you obviously can't say the
words, so clearly you did it.

16:26.681 --> 16:28.482
Fine! I did it, okay?

16:28.516 --> 16:30.784
- You monster!
- Oh, my God!

16:30.818 --> 16:32.686
Well, I hope it was worth it, Murray.

16:32.720 --> 16:35.689
You ruined your kids' college
years to save a few bucks.

16:35.723 --> 16:38.025
I didn't do it because I was cheap.

16:38.059 --> 16:39.726
Then why? Why would you do this?

16:39.794 --> 16:41.128
'Cause I'm gonna miss 'em.

16:41.162 --> 16:42.195
What? He's doing it again.

16:42.230 --> 16:43.563
I'm gonna miss 'em.

16:43.631 --> 16:45.232
Murray, say the words!

16:45.299 --> 16:46.700
I'm gonna miss 'em, okay?

16:46.734 --> 16:48.802
I spent their whole childhood

16:48.836 --> 16:51.705
sitting in that chair watching TV!

16:51.739 --> 16:53.507
And now they're leaving for college

16:53.541 --> 16:54.908
and there's nothing I can do!

16:54.976 --> 16:56.076
It's too late!

17:04.101 --> 17:06.069
<i>I made a mess of it with Dana,</i>

17:06.103 --> 17:07.436
<i>but I was determined to clean it up.</i>

17:09.940 --> 17:12.842
Ohh, damn it.

17:12.877 --> 17:14.777
Why'd they oil all the doors?

17:14.845 --> 17:17.547
<i>But first, I had to deal
with the swooping jocks.</i>

17:17.580 --> 17:18.915
Dana, can I have a word with you?

17:18.949 --> 17:20.415
Why?

17:20.451 --> 17:22.018
So you can abuse her trust again?

17:22.051 --> 17:23.853
No, JC Spink as Magnum.

17:23.887 --> 17:25.788
She needed a friend more than anything.

17:25.856 --> 17:28.625
Good recap, Walls as TC,
Magnum's helicopter pilot.

17:28.692 --> 17:30.693
- If I could just...
- It's called listening.

17:30.728 --> 17:33.897
There's a reason God gave
us one mouth and two ears.

17:33.931 --> 17:36.599
I get it, Johnny Atkins as
the knowy, fussbottom Higgins.

17:36.634 --> 17:38.234
Now, please, can I
just talk to her alone?

17:38.269 --> 17:39.769
Bro, do you know what it's like

17:39.803 --> 17:41.905
to move back to another city?

17:41.939 --> 17:44.307
Not knowing if you'll
find acceptance or not?

17:44.375 --> 17:45.942
Not to mention her
grandmother just passed.

17:45.976 --> 17:47.410
Can you imagine, dude?

17:47.444 --> 17:49.546
My grandma's my North Star.

17:49.580 --> 17:51.114
You were the one she
thought she could count on.

17:51.148 --> 17:53.583
Thus her intense disappointment.

17:53.617 --> 17:55.585
Okay, I'm glad she shared
so much with everyone.

17:55.619 --> 17:57.754
It's fine, you guys.
We'll catch up later.

17:57.788 --> 17:59.789
At least we can be
attentive to her needs.

18:01.992 --> 18:03.393
Wow.

18:03.427 --> 18:05.662
The jocks did a lot of
soul searching this summer.

18:05.729 --> 18:07.931
Yeah. Turns out, they're good friends.

18:07.965 --> 18:09.632
I deserved that.

18:09.667 --> 18:12.168
Well, they're not wrong.
I have a lot going on,

18:12.236 --> 18:13.336
and the Adam that I used to know

18:13.404 --> 18:14.470
would have understood that.

18:14.505 --> 18:16.739
And I do. Here.

18:17.841 --> 18:19.108
No.

18:19.143 --> 18:21.578
It's not what you think.
It's a friendship ring.

18:21.612 --> 18:23.813
When I gave it to you the
first time, we were friends,

18:23.847 --> 18:24.981
and I know that's what you need now.

18:28.686 --> 18:30.153
And if you can forgive me,

18:30.187 --> 18:32.021
I'll be best friend
you could ever ask for.

18:32.089 --> 18:34.791
<i>♪ Over you</i>

18:34.825 --> 18:37.760
<i>♪ I can't believe you're gone</i>

18:37.795 --> 18:39.195
Well, then, I guess
I should forgive you.

18:40.598 --> 18:44.701
<i>♪ You were the first,
you'll be the last</i>

18:46.437 --> 18:50.139
<i>♪ Wherever you go, I'll be with you</i>

18:50.174 --> 18:52.942
I had no idea how you felt
about missing the children.

18:52.977 --> 18:55.645
Neither did I.

18:55.679 --> 18:57.513
And then bags started getting packed

18:57.548 --> 18:59.983
and posters came off the walls,

19:00.017 --> 19:02.819
and it became too real.

19:02.853 --> 19:04.354
<i>♪ To lay your heart and head upon</i>

19:04.388 --> 19:06.189
<i>♪ Remember, after the fire</i>

19:07.791 --> 19:10.059
All you've ever wanted was
for the kids to go to college.

19:10.127 --> 19:11.394
Yeah.

19:11.462 --> 19:13.396
I put so much focus on them leaving,

19:13.464 --> 19:15.365
I never thought of them not being here.

19:15.399 --> 19:17.000
Oh, Murray.

19:17.034 --> 19:19.302
I just wish I would have
spent more time with them.

19:21.171 --> 19:23.206
It's not too late.

19:27.311 --> 19:28.811
What's that for?

19:28.846 --> 19:30.913
I just wanted to say
I'm sorry for what I did.

19:30.981 --> 19:31.981
Real beans this time.

19:32.583 --> 19:33.716
Thanks, Dad.

19:33.751 --> 19:35.018
I also talked to the school

19:35.052 --> 19:36.219
and got you a room in the dorms.

19:36.253 --> 19:37.520
That's amazing!

19:37.554 --> 19:39.255
Wait, what's the roommate situation?

19:39.323 --> 19:41.591
Well, you each have one,

19:41.659 --> 19:42.859
and I think they're both pretty great.

19:44.395 --> 19:46.596
And I'm really gonna miss them.

19:46.664 --> 19:48.531
Wait, are we living with each other?

19:48.565 --> 19:50.066
You think you can make it work?

19:53.704 --> 19:55.038
- We'll make it work.
- Totally.

19:55.072 --> 19:57.774
<i>♪ I'll be with you</i>

19:57.841 --> 19:59.609

19:59.677 --> 20:01.944

they'll always have a

20:04.181 --> 20:06.282

20:06.350 --> 20:09.118
That's the thing about

20:09.186 --> 20:10.953

20:11.021 --> 20:13.289

20:13.357 --> 20:15.692

20:15.726 --> 20:17.460

20:36.647 --> 20:38.881
Dad, how do you feel
about Eric and Barry

20:38.916 --> 20:40.083
both going away to college?

20:40.117 --> 20:41.884
- I'm very happy.
- Really?

20:41.919 --> 20:44.120
Now if you would only
leave, I'd be even happier.

20:44.154 --> 20:47.123
I'm so sad about Eric and Barry leaving.

20:47.157 --> 20:48.925
I can't take it anymore.

20:49.727 --> 20:50.660
Rah!

20:53.315 --> 20:56.518
Erica Goldberg, I was sent
by the shogun to take you out.

20:56.552 --> 20:57.886
Fight me!

20:57.920 --> 21:00.388
I'm not Barry. I'm someone else.

21:00.422 --> 21:03.024
Come on! All roommates do this.

21:03.058 --> 21:04.192
You're the weird one.

21:04.226 --> 21:05.493
Hee-yah!

21:06.028 --> 21:07.762
Ple-e-e-ase?

21:07.830 --> 21:09.364
Ple-e-e-ase?

21:09.398 --> 21:10.899
Okay, I'm only gonna do this once.

21:12.835 --> 21:13.735
Come at me.

21:14.403 --> 21:16.738
Oh! Ow!

21:16.772 --> 21:18.873
You're supposed to warn me!

21:18.908 --> 21:20.174
That's how Houdini died!
