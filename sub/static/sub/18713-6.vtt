00:03.540 --> 00:05.979
He's confident, careful and
forensically aware.

00:05.980 --> 00:08.180
I'd be very surprised if
he hadn't killed before.

00:08.220 --> 00:11.220
Your finger prints are all over
these screwdrivers.

00:11.260 --> 00:13.340
You want to tell me
what the angled tips are about?

00:13.583 --> 00:14.583
No idea.

00:16.379 --> 00:19.340
This is corn-starch found on their
victim, Tina Lunt.

00:19.380 --> 00:22.619
And Clarissa's just retrieved
corn-starch powder from

00:22.620 --> 00:24.420
Lucy Chatham's turbinates.

00:24.460 --> 00:26.154
We're working the same case.

00:26.193 --> 00:30.100
If she wants to play happy families
with a junkie, that's her prerogative.

00:31.180 --> 00:35.419
When you turned the alarm off,
was Alec's Land Rover outside?

00:35.420 --> 00:39.020
You're getting in a state about nothing.
- Was it parked outside?

00:40.900 --> 00:43.255
Which night did you stay at the
guesthouse?

00:43.280 --> 00:44.579
Why are you asking?

Massive trauma to the torso.

01:29.180 --> 01:31.260
Tyre tread marks on his clothing.

01:31.300 --> 01:32.300
And in the blood.

01:34.140 --> 01:36.579
If this is the same killer,
he's learning fast.

01:36.580 --> 01:37.619
How do you mean?

01:37.620 --> 01:40.260
He hit Lucy with his car,
but she survived.

01:41.660 --> 01:44.099
Multiple impact - he left
nothing to chance.

01:44.100 --> 01:47.260
So much for Beale being your
prime suspect.

01:47.300 --> 01:51.100
Just because someone's killed him
doesn't mean he didn't kill Tina.

01:54.660 --> 01:57.460
Wasn't a chance robbery.

01:57.500 --> 01:59.500
There's a couple of
hundred quid in here.

01:59.540 --> 02:02.340
Which leaves what -
pre-arranged meeting?

02:02.380 --> 02:04.460
With Wesley Beale doing the
arranging. Says who?

02:04.500 --> 02:06.419
Well, he lives less than
a mile away.

02:06.420 --> 02:10.020
No CCTV, no prying eyes.
Feels like his call.

02:10.060 --> 02:12.660
If it's his choice of venue,
why's he the one that's dead?

02:12.700 --> 02:15.540
Someone he under-estimated?

02:15.580 --> 02:17.340
Wolf in sheep's clothing?

03:33.900 --> 03:36.419
What are you doing in here?
How did you get in?

03:36.420 --> 03:38.139
Set of keys in your coat.

03:38.140 --> 03:39.163
What coat?

03:39.188 --> 03:42.495
The one you keep in the guesthouse.
Mum was going to chuck all your stuff out.

03:42.520 --> 03:44.052
I thought you might want it.

03:48.220 --> 03:49.460
Thanks.

03:53.500 --> 03:56.180
I think I know what Mum's
worried about.

03:56.220 --> 03:59.300
That the police will find out
you used to be Brett Porter.

04:00.580 --> 04:04.620
Mum was acting so weird, I decided
to get some answers for myself.

04:06.500 --> 04:08.019
Jessie...

04:08.020 --> 04:10.100
I've read all the articles.

04:10.140 --> 04:11.620
Only one thing I don't get.

04:12.700 --> 04:15.820
You were found innocent - so why did
you change your name?

04:18.860 --> 04:20.140
Jack.

04:34.020 --> 04:38.140
Guv. Remember what that girl
said? Jessica Timpson?

04:38.180 --> 04:41.580
Big bloke watching her from
a black Fiesta.

04:41.620 --> 04:45.060
Yeah. We can get her to confirm
easily enough.

04:45.100 --> 04:48.580
So... what was Hounslow Wesley
doing in leafy Surrey?

04:48.620 --> 04:49.780
Getting petrol, for one.

04:50.980 --> 04:54.980
Dated yesterday morning.
A service station in Surrey.

04:55.020 --> 04:58.020
Isn't that near where Lucy
was run down? Yeah.

04:58.060 --> 04:59.860
And Alice and Jasper's flat.

04:59.900 --> 05:02.700
So, we've got a dead bloke
with form for dealing

05:02.740 --> 05:05.940
and a suspect with form
for possession and assault.

05:05.980 --> 05:09.620
Even if Beale was Jasper's supplier,
why would Jasper kill Beale?

05:09.660 --> 05:12.260
He ripped him off? A bad batch?
Any number of reasons.

05:12.300 --> 05:14.380
I'm still not seeing a motive.

05:14.420 --> 05:17.459
Beale's record includes
blackmail, yeah?

05:17.460 --> 05:19.139
Maybe he tries to shake
Jasper down

05:19.140 --> 05:21.540
cos he knows he's got something to
do with Lucy's murder?

05:21.580 --> 05:24.940
We know there is a link
between Lucy and Tina's murders.

05:24.980 --> 05:27.100
We know Beale was in both locales
very recently

05:27.140 --> 05:30.300
and we know he's in the drug
business. We need to talk to Jasper.

05:33.620 --> 05:35.820
The police did everything
they could...

05:35.860 --> 05:37.060
to pin it on me.

05:38.820 --> 05:41.139
The jury saw through it.

05:41.140 --> 05:43.540
Well, they must've
had something else...

05:43.580 --> 05:45.580
for you to be their main suspect?

05:47.220 --> 05:49.859
I'd picked up a conviction...
two years earlier.

05:49.860 --> 05:51.660
For, um,

05:51.700 --> 05:52.900
unlawful sex.

05:54.060 --> 05:56.220
It was all consensual,

05:56.260 --> 05:58.020
completely consensual, but...

05:59.220 --> 06:00.419
..she was 15.

06:00.420 --> 06:02.220
Jess, I know, I know.

06:02.260 --> 06:05.260
But I... I... I was a different
person back then.

06:05.300 --> 06:07.739
Successful. I had half-a-dozen
bars in Brighton

06:07.740 --> 06:09.340
and the girls were just on tap.

06:09.380 --> 06:11.460
Shame you had to pick one
that was 15(!)

06:11.500 --> 06:13.459
It was a mistake.

06:13.460 --> 06:15.300
ONE mistake.

06:15.340 --> 06:16.740
Still.

06:16.780 --> 06:19.300
She didn't even want
to press charges.

06:19.340 --> 06:22.140
It was all down to her parents
and the police and...

06:28.420 --> 06:30.060
Ellie's right, though...

06:30.100 --> 06:31.900
about the missing girl.

06:31.940 --> 06:34.139
With all the police crawling around,

06:34.140 --> 06:36.580
they might find out
I use the guesthouse.

06:36.620 --> 06:39.300
So? So! If they do,

06:39.340 --> 06:42.940
it's best they don't know I stayed
there on Friday night

06:42.980 --> 06:44.620
and only you know that I did.

06:47.300 --> 06:49.019
You want me to lie?!

06:49.020 --> 06:52.700
The police are always looking
for another shot at me.

07:27.180 --> 07:29.380
Do you recognise
the service station, Jasper?

07:29.420 --> 07:31.380
It's down the road from my flat.

07:32.820 --> 07:35.820
What about the bloke filling up?
You recognise him?

07:39.220 --> 07:40.619
Forgive me for asking. What is it?

07:40.620 --> 07:43.580
Six, seven counts of possession
you've clocked up over the years?

07:45.260 --> 07:46.979
Go on. Indulge me.

07:46.980 --> 07:48.060
One last look.

07:51.140 --> 07:53.540
Maybe you remember him...

07:53.580 --> 07:55.180
more like this?

07:56.820 --> 07:59.499
We know from Lucy that you blow up
when things don't go your way.

07:59.500 --> 08:02.219
Is that what happened to Beale?
I don't know Beale!

08:02.220 --> 08:04.140
Did he think you were some sad,
posh junkie

08:04.180 --> 08:05.659
that he could just push around?

08:05.660 --> 08:08.196
Did you put him straight on that
score? Are you listening to me?!

08:08.220 --> 08:10.940
OK, OK. You say you don't know
him, I believe you.

08:13.380 --> 08:16.580
Where were you this evening,
say, from 8pm onwards?

08:16.620 --> 08:19.340
I've been at home all night with
Alice. That's not what SHE says.

08:19.380 --> 08:21.580
She says you didn't get home
until 11.

08:22.660 --> 08:23.820
So, who's lying?

08:26.420 --> 08:29.100
You left here under a bit
of a cloud, didn't you?

08:29.140 --> 08:31.540
Alice didn't want you in the same
car as her,

08:31.580 --> 08:32.980
let alone the same house.

08:33.980 --> 08:35.419
So where did you go, Jasper?

08:38.860 --> 08:40.299
Jesus...

08:40.299 --> 08:42.700
That's it... Get it off your chest.

08:43.740 --> 08:44.940
I went out to score.

08:46.380 --> 08:49.699
All that shit you put me through,
I needed a fix.

08:49.700 --> 08:52.260
But my dealer is not Wesley Beale.

08:52.300 --> 08:55.100
And where does he reside,
YOUR dealer? Brentford.

08:55.140 --> 08:56.979
42, Pixley Road.

08:56.980 --> 08:59.379
You lot have got cameras up
and down that street,

08:59.380 --> 09:00.940
for all the good it does you.

09:00.980 --> 09:03.100
So, unless I snuck out the back,

09:03.140 --> 09:06.299
hightailed it over to this, what...

09:06.300 --> 09:07.699
Industrial estate...?

09:07.700 --> 09:10.539
Ran this poor chap over - not
forgetting I don't have my car -

09:10.540 --> 09:11.780
before quietly sneaking back...

09:13.620 --> 09:15.220
I think you'd better order me a cab.

09:18.860 --> 09:20.300
Hiya.

09:20.340 --> 09:21.900
Sorry it's late.

09:21.940 --> 09:23.819
Can you process that for me?

09:23.820 --> 09:25.100
Sure.

09:27.020 --> 09:28.020
Huh!

09:28.060 --> 09:30.420
What's it's, er, provenance?

09:30.460 --> 09:32.699
Bit unusual. OK...

09:32.700 --> 09:36.579
It was dumped by a girl only
tangentially involved in the case.

09:36.580 --> 09:40.180
Right. If you just find one set of
prints, one set of female DNA,

09:40.220 --> 09:42.740
then no further action required.

09:42.780 --> 09:43.940
I see.

09:43.980 --> 09:45.860
Getting soft in your old age?

11:04.100 --> 11:06.100
Where've you been?

11:06.140 --> 11:07.740
Visiting a patient.

11:07.780 --> 11:09.820
But you weren't on call tonight?

11:11.020 --> 11:12.340
Clive Jones.

11:12.380 --> 11:14.620
He seems to distrust
the younger doctors.

11:14.660 --> 11:16.900
And, it must be said,
they're not crazy about him.

11:19.340 --> 11:20.940
What's that car you're driving?

11:20.980 --> 11:22.779
I told you. Garage lent it to me.

11:22.780 --> 11:24.260
While they're fixing the VW.

11:24.300 --> 11:25.820
Mm, right.

11:25.860 --> 11:26.900
What's wrong with it?

11:29.980 --> 11:32.100
The petrol gauge is playing up.

11:32.140 --> 11:33.940
Says "empty" when it's full.

11:39.820 --> 11:41.820
I asked Jess, point blank,

11:41.860 --> 11:43.900
which night she saw Alec
at the guesthouse.

11:46.380 --> 11:48.660
She said it was Thursday. And?

11:48.700 --> 11:51.100
And I know her well enough
to know when she's lying.

11:52.660 --> 11:55.236
Not this again... And I remember her
being around on Thursday night.

11:55.260 --> 11:57.500
What are you saying?
That he got her to lie?

12:01.980 --> 12:05.620
I think they've seen each other.
Well, they've always been close.

12:05.660 --> 12:09.500
At the very least, they've spoken.
Why are you torturing yourself?

12:09.540 --> 12:11.899
If he was here Friday,

12:11.900 --> 12:14.340
that means he left Saturday morning.

12:16.060 --> 12:18.180
And that's when Lucy Chatham...

12:18.220 --> 12:19.780
So, we're back to that again?

12:23.740 --> 12:25.100
Ellie,

12:25.140 --> 12:27.499
you're worrying about nothing.

12:27.500 --> 12:28.620
Am I?

12:30.060 --> 12:31.380
How do you know?

12:48.700 --> 12:50.780
'That trust. That love.

12:51.940 --> 12:55.419
'I think you mean total,
undiluted dependence..

12:55.420 --> 12:56.620
'I know love when I see it.

12:58.260 --> 13:00.499
'God, you're such a softie!

13:00.500 --> 13:03.739
'If we stopped feeding her
and the neighbours stepped in,

13:03.740 --> 13:05.940
'they'd get that look.
That's just cynical...

13:05.980 --> 13:07.540
'What're you saying?

13:07.580 --> 13:09.539
'Our kids never love us?

13:09.540 --> 13:10.820
'It's never real?

13:12.300 --> 13:14.860
'What crap is Mummy spouting?

13:14.900 --> 13:16.860
'Let me translate.

13:18.380 --> 13:20.099
'"I love my Dad.

13:20.100 --> 13:21.419
'"He's the greatest.

13:21.420 --> 13:23.619
' "He can do no wrong."

13:23.620 --> 13:25.220
'What about Mum?!

13:26.500 --> 13:28.699
' "On the fence about Mum."

13:28.700 --> 13:30.460
' "On the fence"!

13:32.380 --> 13:33.580
'Hello.

13:33.620 --> 13:35.820
'Say "hello" to the camera.

13:38.580 --> 13:42.100
'Look at you! Lovely girl!

13:42.140 --> 13:43.820
'Yay!'

14:52.540 --> 14:55.420
'Obviously, the discovery
of Lucy's body is a devastating blow

14:55.460 --> 14:57.539
'to the family, but from
an investigative angle,

14:57.540 --> 15:00.100
'we now have a wealth of new
evidence to work with.

15:00.140 --> 15:02.940
'The net is closing in on this man,
make no mistake...'

15:11.100 --> 15:13.059
Someone have a nightcap?

15:13.060 --> 15:15.500
I had a couple after you
went to bed.

15:15.540 --> 15:17.299
"Couple" (!)

15:17.300 --> 15:19.580
Shouldn't it be me
hitting the bottle?

15:29.220 --> 15:31.020
What is it?

15:34.060 --> 15:35.060
Nick...?

15:40.180 --> 15:43.740
I've had a lot of patients
die recently.

15:45.060 --> 15:47.860
Mostly of old age,
no great surprises, but...

15:48.900 --> 15:51.180
..people who meant a lot to me...

15:53.660 --> 15:54.980
I'm so proud of you.

16:13.860 --> 16:15.300
Is there anything else?

16:17.540 --> 16:21.180
This girl going missing, it's
stirred up memories for me, too.

16:22.420 --> 16:24.420
What Alec went through
when we were young...

16:24.460 --> 16:26.220
the trauma, the after-effects...

16:27.500 --> 16:29.900
..we all weathered that storm,
me included.

16:29.940 --> 16:31.940
I've always thought
you didn't like Alec.

16:31.980 --> 16:33.460
Back in the day, not much.

16:33.500 --> 16:35.660
Not sure he liked me much, either.

16:35.700 --> 16:39.020
Thought I was trying to cramp
his sister's style.

16:40.700 --> 16:42.420
That's not true.

16:42.460 --> 16:44.140
But I like the man he grew into.

16:45.740 --> 16:46.980
I like Alec.

16:49.500 --> 16:51.980
That's what matters, isn't it?

16:52.020 --> 16:53.060
Who we are today?

16:54.500 --> 16:56.340
In the here and now?

16:58.260 --> 17:00.660
Who'd like their younger self
if they met them in the street?

17:01.820 --> 17:03.820
I was a stuffy old git
when I was young.

17:05.060 --> 17:07.660
If I hadn't met you.
I would've stayed one.

17:38.980 --> 17:40.180
Yes.

17:40.220 --> 17:41.819
'Dr Timpson?

17:41.820 --> 17:43.180
'Ali from the garage here.'

17:44.580 --> 17:46.499
Ali, hi...

17:46.500 --> 17:48.660
'Well, your car's ready, all fixed.'

17:50.020 --> 17:51.340
Right. Great.

17:52.460 --> 17:53.739
'We can drop that off later

17:53.740 --> 17:56.899
'and we'll pop the keys through
the letterbox if no-one's there.'

17:56.900 --> 17:58.819
No, no, I'll come and collect it.

17:58.820 --> 18:00.060
'It's no bother.'

18:01.940 --> 18:04.500
I'll come and collect it now,
thank you.

18:09.020 --> 18:12.860
I found two sets of prints and DNA
on the hash pipe and the clingfilm.

18:12.900 --> 18:14.900
What hash pipe? This one.

18:16.980 --> 18:19.379
I saw Jessica Timpson
get rid of a carrier bag

18:19.380 --> 18:21.180
in a bin just down the road
from her house.

18:21.220 --> 18:23.460
She's the daughter of the guy
whose car alarm went off.

18:23.500 --> 18:24.740
Yeah, I know who she is.

18:24.780 --> 18:27.579
I didn't want to take any action
unless it related to the case.

18:27.580 --> 18:29.180
That's my call, not yours.

18:30.380 --> 18:34.620
One set of prints scored
a match with a Brett Porter.

18:34.660 --> 18:40.100
Prime suspect in the rape and murder
of Leah Tyler in Brighton in '96 -

18:40.140 --> 18:43.019
he now goes by the name
of Alec Porter.

18:43.020 --> 18:44.660
Name change. Never a good sign...

18:44.700 --> 18:47.620
17-year-old Leah was walking home
when she was raped,

18:47.660 --> 18:50.220
bludgeoned and strangled
near Porter's house.

18:50.260 --> 18:53.700
Local offie recalled Porter coming
in for cigarettes at 3am.

18:53.740 --> 18:56.499
Right when the pathologist believed
that Leah was killed.

18:56.500 --> 18:59.019
When police got wind of
his unlawful sex conviction,

18:59.020 --> 19:01.299
and their interest doubled.
But he didn't go down for it?

19:01.300 --> 19:03.420
But swathes of the public still
thought he did it.

19:03.460 --> 19:05.299
Pretty clear the police did, too.

19:05.300 --> 19:08.620
Porter's prints showing up
could be just a coincidence.

19:09.900 --> 19:12.379
She's young, blonde and pretty -
just like Lucy.

19:12.380 --> 19:15.219
And she suffered blunt force
trauma to the head.

19:15.220 --> 19:17.219
Porter's vehicle's registered
in Brighton,

19:17.220 --> 19:18.900
but he's no stranger to Surrey.

19:18.940 --> 19:22.540
Last year, he got three points
going through a camera on the A34.

19:22.580 --> 19:25.820
A34, that's, what, half
a mile from Lucy's front door?

19:25.860 --> 19:27.820
Hang on, still leaves Tina Lunt.

19:27.860 --> 19:29.740
Maybe she was a witness?

19:31.540 --> 19:33.300
I know - well, I KNEW -

19:33.340 --> 19:37.619
the pathologist on the Leah Tyler
murder. Mike Liston.

19:37.620 --> 19:39.219
But?

19:39.220 --> 19:41.020
He's in Esher Open Prison.

19:41.060 --> 19:43.619
Got caught falsifying path reports,

19:43.620 --> 19:46.500
casting doubt on
all his previous cases.

19:46.540 --> 19:48.420
Including Leah Tyler's?

19:50.220 --> 19:51.979
Are you up for speaking to him?

19:51.980 --> 19:53.460
It might speed things up?

19:57.940 --> 20:00.100
Just sign some paperwork for us.

20:00.140 --> 20:01.820
I got my own. Thanks.

20:03.820 --> 20:06.420
Couldn't hold the page down for me,
could you? Oh, sure.

20:11.740 --> 20:12.900
Lovely.

20:12.940 --> 20:14.340
Good as new.

20:14.380 --> 20:16.580
You'd never know anything
ever happened.

20:16.620 --> 20:17.660
Great. Thanks.

20:19.660 --> 20:21.700
Where's the key? Oh.

20:23.020 --> 20:25.379
You don't mind me asking
how the air bag went off?

20:25.380 --> 20:27.140
What...? I've no idea.

20:27.180 --> 20:29.140
Some kind of malfunction.

20:29.180 --> 20:32.420
That can happen, but we'd usually
see it when we strip it out.

20:33.580 --> 20:36.300
OK...? There was nothing wrong
with your air bag.

20:36.340 --> 20:38.500
Thanks so much, Ali. Key, please.

20:39.500 --> 20:41.459
Everything all right, Dr Timpson?

20:41.460 --> 20:43.980
Fine. Lots of patients to see.

20:59.260 --> 21:00.620
Thanks.

21:05.060 --> 21:06.740
Here you go, Dr Alexander.

21:07.820 --> 21:08.820
Thanks.

21:27.100 --> 21:28.379
Mike!

21:28.380 --> 21:29.820
You have a visitor.

21:29.860 --> 21:31.340
Oh...

21:31.380 --> 21:32.580
Thanks.

21:34.420 --> 21:35.580
Hi, Mike.

21:35.620 --> 21:37.220
Thanks for seeing me.

21:37.260 --> 21:38.260
Sit down.

21:39.900 --> 21:41.219
I, er...

21:41.220 --> 21:44.300
I was going to just read
the path report, but, um...

21:44.340 --> 21:46.860
You thought it might have been one
of ones I doctored?

21:46.900 --> 21:48.580
Well, it wasn't.

22:02.060 --> 22:03.579
Hello, Jessica.

22:03.580 --> 22:04.820
Hi...

22:06.500 --> 22:08.700
Do you know an Alec Porter?

22:10.100 --> 22:11.260
Um...

22:11.300 --> 22:12.980
He's my uncle.

22:14.620 --> 22:17.820
He tore off her skirt and underwear,

22:17.860 --> 22:20.419
and probably raped her.
"Probably"?

22:20.420 --> 22:24.380
There was evidence of recent sexual
activity and the presence of semen.

22:25.580 --> 22:28.020
But as you know, rape is, er,
notoriously hard to prove.

22:29.260 --> 22:32.699
What about cause of death? Well,
I called that wrong to start with.

22:32.700 --> 22:35.100
At the scene,
I assumed the cause of death

22:35.140 --> 22:38.140
was blunt force trauma
to the skull...

22:39.820 --> 22:42.180
Think I might've thought the same...

22:42.220 --> 22:43.459
Yeah, well,

22:43.460 --> 22:45.900
I found a Yorkstone brick
in the undergrowth

22:45.940 --> 22:50.100
which matched the yellow brick
dust in Leah's wounds...

22:50.140 --> 22:52.939
The brick itself came from a pallet
on Porter's front drive -

22:52.940 --> 22:54.780
he was having his house extended.

22:54.820 --> 22:57.220
Another black mark against him?

22:57.260 --> 22:58.660
Big one.

22:58.700 --> 23:01.100
Yeah, but where the case against
Porter fell down

23:01.140 --> 23:02.900
was the semen deposits.

23:02.940 --> 23:05.819
Didn't match his DNA?
The police were not deterred.

23:05.820 --> 23:07.620
I mean, they formed a theory
that the semen

23:07.660 --> 23:10.260
came from an earlier sexual
encounter

23:10.300 --> 23:13.579
and that Porter wore a condom, or...

23:13.580 --> 23:15.940
he was unable to perform

23:15.980 --> 23:18.539
after a heavy night at his club.

23:18.540 --> 23:21.620
That might've explained his rage
and overkill. Well, it might.

23:23.100 --> 23:25.260
Anything else to support the theory?

23:25.300 --> 23:28.940
Leah had told a girlfriend that she
was seeing an older, married man.

23:30.580 --> 23:32.819
The police thought
the semen was his,

23:32.820 --> 23:34.459
but he'd never come forward,

23:34.460 --> 23:36.420
for obvious reasons...

23:36.460 --> 23:37.979
He was never traced?

23:37.980 --> 23:39.100
No.

23:40.780 --> 23:43.980
Gun to the head,
do you think Porter killed her?

23:44.020 --> 23:46.139
Mmm, it always bothered me

23:46.140 --> 23:49.660
we never ID'd the secretor
of the semen found on Leah.

23:50.860 --> 23:54.020
It bothered the jury, too.
It was a factor in his acquittal?

23:54.060 --> 23:55.780
The ONLY factor.

23:55.820 --> 23:58.980
Almost the definition
of "reasonable doubt".

24:00.380 --> 24:01.660
Thanks, Mike.

24:01.700 --> 24:02.740
I appreciate this.

24:04.140 --> 24:05.179
I...

24:05.180 --> 24:07.860
I... I don't feel sorry for myself.

24:08.900 --> 24:10.660
Only for the people I've let down.

24:10.700 --> 24:12.420
My family,

24:12.460 --> 24:13.900
my colleagues...

24:15.740 --> 24:17.100
When I was first sentenced,

24:17.140 --> 24:19.740
I had an answer for everything.

24:19.780 --> 24:23.220
I'd tell myself it wasn't fair to
judge a man by his worst decision.

24:24.620 --> 24:28.140
By a moment of weakness and greed.

24:29.700 --> 24:31.700
But now, I know better.

24:32.740 --> 24:36.260
It's our worst decisions
that define us, Nikki.

24:37.420 --> 24:38.860
They're the ones
we have to live by.

25:31.460 --> 25:33.499
Grace?

25:33.500 --> 25:35.100
It's me. It's Nick.

25:40.620 --> 25:41.780
How have you been, Grace?

25:43.220 --> 25:45.460
Oh, you know. Can't complain.

25:47.140 --> 25:49.459
Up to date with your pills?

25:49.460 --> 25:52.659
I've been using that timer
you got me. Good.

25:52.660 --> 25:54.220
Glad that's working out.

25:59.500 --> 26:00.699
Oh!

26:00.700 --> 26:02.580
What's happened here?

26:02.620 --> 26:04.100
Oh...

26:04.140 --> 26:07.060
I've been asking myself that
question all day.

26:07.100 --> 26:09.580
Have you put it in your journal?

26:09.620 --> 26:12.060
Be a blessing when the rest
of my memory goes...

26:12.100 --> 26:14.220
Oh, what sort of talk is that?

26:15.340 --> 26:18.140
The pipe, the dope -
it's all mine.

26:18.180 --> 26:21.180
You want to arrest me -
fine, go ahead.

26:21.220 --> 26:24.460
Don't drag Alec into it. He's been
through enough shit, thanks to you.

26:24.500 --> 26:27.100
Some would say he got off lightly.
You ruined his life.

26:27.140 --> 26:30.740
How is that getting off "lightly"?
When did you last see your uncle?

26:30.780 --> 26:33.180
In Brighton. Two months ago.

26:33.220 --> 26:37.020
See, I think you've seen him more
recently. And not in Brighton.

26:37.060 --> 26:39.940
No, Alec never comes to our house.
Never?

26:39.980 --> 26:41.900
Not for ages...

26:41.940 --> 26:44.780
That's funny, a week ago,
he went through a speed camera

26:44.820 --> 26:46.820
half a mile from your front door.

26:48.260 --> 26:50.260
You sure he didn't drop in
for a cup of tea?

29:42.940 --> 29:44.299
Ellie...

29:44.300 --> 29:48.019
'Where've you been? Why the HELL
aren't you answering your phone?'

29:48.020 --> 29:50.220
Sorry, I was with a patient...

29:50.260 --> 29:53.539
'Come home NOW.
The police are here.'

29:53.540 --> 29:57.299
The police?
Want do they want... exactly?

29:57.300 --> 30:00.380
'They went to arrest Alec
mob-handed.

30:00.420 --> 30:01.980
'He lashed out and ran.

30:02.418 --> 30:04.418
'They're still looking for him.

30:05.780 --> 30:07.105
'Nick?!'

30:07.130 --> 30:09.277
Yeah. I'm still here.

30:14.220 --> 30:15.579
What is that?

30:15.580 --> 30:17.420
This...

30:17.460 --> 30:19.739
is an air bag,

30:19.740 --> 30:21.500
minus its housing..

30:21.540 --> 30:23.659
Want to make yourself useful?

30:23.660 --> 30:25.020
Not particularly.

30:26.180 --> 30:28.420
Fridge over there. Top shelf.

30:42.500 --> 30:44.060
Ah! Thank you.

30:49.340 --> 30:51.340
You might want to stand well back.

31:03.340 --> 31:04.780
Three.

31:10.940 --> 31:12.140
Two.

31:15.220 --> 31:16.340
One.

31:32.940 --> 31:35.099
Clean entry wound.

31:35.100 --> 31:36.499
Barely torn the flesh.

31:36.500 --> 31:38.060
Sound familiar?

31:38.100 --> 31:41.740
Tina Lunt... The screwdriver was
driven into her with such force,

31:41.780 --> 31:44.420
it broke off the handle,
smashed through her sternum

31:44.460 --> 31:46.500
and scarcely tore the skin...

31:46.540 --> 31:48.740
Covering her in cornstarch powder.

31:49.900 --> 31:52.219
If Tina Lunt wasn't murdered,

31:52.220 --> 31:54.139
who moved her body and why?

31:54.140 --> 31:56.980
My money? Wesley Beale, for
reasons of self-preservation.

31:57.020 --> 31:59.019
The same powder was found
on Lucy Chatham -

31:59.020 --> 32:00.780
are we saying Beale killed HER?

32:00.820 --> 32:03.060
Well, I'm hoping Wesley
can provide some answers.

32:04.500 --> 32:05.500
Have a look.

32:07.060 --> 32:08.700
Right, this is what we know.

32:10.380 --> 32:12.419
Cause of death - chest and abdominal
injuries

32:12.420 --> 32:15.020
consistent with multiple
overrunnings by a vehicle.

32:16.500 --> 32:18.700
Look at these. These are different.

32:18.740 --> 32:21.860
They're older and the abrasions
are not consistent with a collision.

32:21.900 --> 32:24.820
He'd been struck repeatedly
by the same implement.

32:24.860 --> 32:27.460
Twin marks with a broadening
at one end...

32:27.500 --> 32:30.140
it's not a blade, or
we'd see deeper cuts...

32:30.180 --> 32:32.579
Is this a spanner?

32:32.580 --> 32:34.940
Well, a spanner is a contender,
certainly.

32:36.820 --> 32:40.059
Do you think we'd find a spanner
lying around Maconi's garage?

32:40.060 --> 32:41.460
Yeah, one or two.

32:42.900 --> 32:44.500
All right, Dan? All right.

32:45.740 --> 32:47.220
So, this...

32:47.260 --> 32:49.820
is a photograph
of Wesley Beale's back.

32:52.380 --> 32:54.060
I didn't kill him.

32:54.100 --> 32:56.660
Those wounds were sustained
some days before he died.

32:56.700 --> 32:58.779
Our money's on a spanner.

32:58.780 --> 33:01.780
I can't help you. Think of it more
as helping yourself.

33:01.820 --> 33:03.580
Beale's dead. Murdered.

33:03.620 --> 33:05.100
Those wounds...

33:05.140 --> 33:06.660
they're systematic.

33:06.700 --> 33:08.460
Controlled.

33:08.500 --> 33:09.939
Features associated with torture.

33:09.940 --> 33:14.340
In most juror's minds, from torture
to murder's but a hop and a skip.

33:14.380 --> 33:16.980
Added to which,
Beale was killed by a car,

33:17.020 --> 33:19.020
and you, well...

33:19.060 --> 33:20.940
You're in the car business.

33:24.460 --> 33:27.340
He owed me some money, OK?

33:27.380 --> 33:30.020
Ah, so, your lot thought beating
was a friendly reminder?

33:30.060 --> 33:32.620
Yeah! Seemed to work, too.

33:32.660 --> 33:33.940
Go on...

33:33.980 --> 33:37.619
He comes in yesterday, all cocky.
Pleased with himself.

33:37.620 --> 33:39.340
He's found a way to get my money.

33:39.380 --> 33:42.580
He's got some rich bloke over
a barrel. He mention a name?

33:42.620 --> 33:44.900
No. You ask him what he had
on this bloke?

33:44.940 --> 33:48.259
He said it wasn't murder,
but it was as good as.

34:38.300 --> 34:41.460
Nick, tell them! They won't
listen! Tell them what?

34:41.500 --> 34:44.540
Don't answer that, please. That
we haven't seen Alec for months.

34:46.060 --> 34:50.059
Well? Is it true? Yes, we haven't
seen Alec for a good while.

34:50.060 --> 34:52.076
Fortunately, I don't have to take
your word for it -

34:52.100 --> 34:54.699
this is a warrant to search
the premises. Shall we? Thank you.

34:54.739 --> 34:56.620
What are you expecting
to find, exactly?

34:56.659 --> 34:59.980
Well, whatever it is, we don't need
any help, thank you. Wait a second!

35:00.020 --> 35:02.020
I just spoke to your neighbours.

35:02.060 --> 35:04.259
They say your brother's
a frequent visitor

35:04.260 --> 35:07.260
and stays in a guesthouse in the
back garden? That's not true...

35:07.300 --> 35:10.940
You don't have a guesthouse?
We do, but Alec doesn't stay in it.

35:10.980 --> 35:12.780
So, when we process it
for prints and DNA,

35:12.820 --> 35:14.820
we won't find results
matching his profile?

35:14.860 --> 35:16.420
OK, Christ!

35:16.460 --> 35:18.420
Has he ever stayed there? Yes,

35:18.460 --> 35:21.100
but... not recently,
so it doesn't matter, does it?

35:21.140 --> 35:22.820
Can you show us the guesthouse,
please?

35:33.700 --> 35:36.140
One of your vehicles
have an oil leak?

35:36.180 --> 35:38.140
We had some friends staying
last week.

35:38.180 --> 35:40.219
It must be from their car.
Right, you two,

35:40.220 --> 35:43.060
just take a couple of paces
that way, please. Thank you.

35:44.420 --> 35:45.660
She's lying.

35:45.700 --> 35:47.300
Yeah, no shit(!)

35:50.980 --> 35:53.219
Hi, can you check
under Alec's vehicle,

35:53.220 --> 35:55.060
see if there's an oil leak, please?

35:57.300 --> 35:58.460
Checking now.

36:05.740 --> 36:06.900
Yeah.

36:06.940 --> 36:09.060
OK, thank you.

36:10.580 --> 36:14.099
OK, just to clarify, no two
brands of oil are the same.

36:14.100 --> 36:16.500
So, if this oil comes
from Alec's vehicle,

36:16.540 --> 36:19.619
I'll be able to prove that,
chemically.

36:19.620 --> 36:20.659
One more time.

36:20.660 --> 36:23.300
When did you last see your brother?

36:25.100 --> 36:27.020
I think he may have stayed here
Friday night.

37:07.140 --> 37:08.980
Stop. I'll let the dogs go!

37:09.020 --> 37:10.980
Stop where you are!

37:12.340 --> 37:13.340
Stop now!

37:14.980 --> 37:16.220
Stop!

37:36.020 --> 37:38.020
What is it?

37:38.060 --> 37:39.620
A hunch.

37:39.660 --> 37:41.060
Thomas.

37:41.100 --> 37:44.659
'Jack. I think Tina Lunt was
killed by a deployed air bag.

37:44.660 --> 37:46.140
'This morning, DS Wretzky'

37:46.180 --> 37:49.219
said something about Timpson's
car alarm going off?

37:49.220 --> 37:52.979
A deployed air bag would
trigger the alarm. Exactly.

37:52.980 --> 37:55.779
How does this tie in
with Beale's murder?

37:55.780 --> 37:58.900
'Not sure. Seems like Beale
was blackmailing someone

37:58.940 --> 38:00.260
'and it backfired.'

38:06.500 --> 38:09.539
I hear your car alarm went off
on Saturday morning?

38:09.540 --> 38:12.020
Just a malfunction.
Was no harm done.

38:14.380 --> 38:17.020
Had some work done recently?
Sorry?

38:17.060 --> 38:18.420
Seat covers in your car.

38:20.340 --> 38:21.860
Oh, petrol gauge was playing up.

38:21.900 --> 38:23.620
Saying it was empty when it wasn't.

38:23.660 --> 38:25.740
Covered your seats just for that?

38:25.780 --> 38:28.619
They know I'm a neat-freak.

38:28.620 --> 38:30.979
So, nothing to do with
the alarm going off?

38:30.980 --> 38:33.219
No. Same vehicle, though?

38:33.220 --> 38:35.419
Yeah. Same vehicle.

38:35.420 --> 38:36.619
OK.

38:36.620 --> 38:38.140
Thank you.

38:42.740 --> 38:46.060
Looks like Nick's had some
work done on his car. Right.

38:46.100 --> 38:48.940
Be good to know it had nothing
to do with air bags.

38:50.340 --> 38:52.540
OK. Where is he?

38:54.420 --> 38:57.260
Did you see where Nick Timpson
went to? No, why?

38:59.780 --> 39:02.620
Where's your husband? What...?
Where's Nick?

39:16.340 --> 39:18.899
Dad?

39:18.900 --> 39:21.020
I need you to come and pick me up,
sweetheart.

39:21.060 --> 39:22.859
'What's going on?'

39:22.860 --> 39:25.660
It's Alec. The police are hanging
round like a bad smell

39:25.700 --> 39:28.900
'and we need to warn him.'
Where are you? You sound weird.

39:28.940 --> 39:31.179
It's very important you don't
take any more calls, Jess.

39:31.180 --> 39:33.419
'The police will be tracking
your phone.' What...?

39:33.420 --> 39:35.220
Here's where I want you to
meet me.

39:39.300 --> 39:42.820
Where would Nick go?
I don't know. Think!

39:44.380 --> 39:48.420
I don't know where he'd go. I don't
know WHY he'd go. I don't know!

39:53.820 --> 39:55.900
What have you got?

39:55.940 --> 39:58.340
I've just called his mechanics -

39:58.380 --> 40:00.380
they fitted a new air bag yesterday

40:00.420 --> 40:03.700
as well as replacing the front
bumper, touching up the paintwork...

40:03.740 --> 40:07.339
It looks like Tina Lunt tried to
steal the air bag from Nick's car -

40:07.340 --> 40:09.740
killing herself in the process.

40:09.780 --> 40:13.420
The air bag propelled the
screwdriver into her heart.

40:13.460 --> 40:14.780
Accidental death?

40:15.900 --> 40:18.139
Wesley Beale,
her partner-in-crime -

40:18.140 --> 40:20.700
showed his true colours
and fled the scene.

40:23.980 --> 40:26.420
So, Jessica tells her dad
his car alarm is going off.

40:26.460 --> 40:28.420
He comes out to investigate
and then...

40:28.460 --> 40:31.140
'decides to remove
Tina's body from the car.'

40:37.980 --> 40:40.379
From the direction
Lucy was travelling in,

40:40.380 --> 40:42.259
she would have
turned into the lane

40:42.260 --> 40:45.300
and would have had a clear view
into the drive.

40:50.740 --> 40:53.500
'And then, Nick had
another problem on his hands.

41:23.140 --> 41:24.659
'Why?'

41:24.660 --> 41:27.579
Why did he take Tina's body
out of the car?

41:27.580 --> 41:29.380
Why couldn't he call the police?

41:32.860 --> 41:34.860
Keep going straight ahead.

41:34.900 --> 41:36.100
Almost there.

41:36.140 --> 41:38.300
And turn left into the house.

41:38.340 --> 41:39.740
Where are we going, Dad?

41:40.620 --> 41:42.380
Somewhere safe.

41:42.420 --> 41:44.059
Alec will join us later.

41:44.060 --> 41:45.220
And Mum.

41:46.580 --> 41:48.100
It's all going to be OK!

41:52.980 --> 41:54.780
I told you to turn that off!
It's Mum!

41:54.820 --> 41:57.180
Doesn't she need to know
where to find us?

42:01.380 --> 42:03.180
Jessica's still not answering.

42:06.500 --> 42:07.700
Look...

42:09.980 --> 42:11.420
You're not in trouble, Ellie.

42:11.460 --> 42:12.899
We just need your help.

42:12.900 --> 42:14.500
OK.

42:14.540 --> 42:18.820
So, who would Nick turn to when
he's in a bind? Who are his mates?

42:20.940 --> 42:22.820
He doesn't really have any mates.

42:24.700 --> 42:28.380
Sounds weird, but... his best friends
are probably his patients.

42:30.060 --> 42:32.580
It's nice to meet you.
You too, Jessica.

42:33.940 --> 42:36.300
Well, I'll put the kettle on.
No, I'll do it.

42:39.620 --> 42:42.100
Nick? Mm-hm?

42:42.140 --> 42:44.940
Did you put something
in the burner... earlier?

42:46.740 --> 42:50.020
What? After you left,
I had a walk around

42:50.060 --> 42:51.620
and it had been used.

42:55.740 --> 42:57.500
Really? You sure?

42:57.540 --> 42:59.379
Mm. It was hot.

42:59.380 --> 43:02.020
It looked like someone
had been burning clothes.

43:03.420 --> 43:04.540
Strange.

43:10.340 --> 43:13.140
I think I shall call the police.
The police?

43:13.180 --> 43:16.659
I'm sure that's not necessary.
How do you know?

43:16.660 --> 43:19.860
If they're using the burner,
what else are they doing?

43:21.300 --> 43:24.379
You're right,
we should get to the bottom of this.

43:24.380 --> 43:27.780
I'll call them in a minute. Oh, you
don't have to do that. No trouble.

43:27.820 --> 43:30.020
If they get a call from me,
they'll take it seriously.

43:30.060 --> 43:31.860
Thank you.

43:33.060 --> 43:35.540
I'd be lost without your dad.

43:37.260 --> 43:38.780
I'm tired.

43:38.820 --> 43:40.180
Might have a sit down.

43:42.060 --> 43:44.420
When the tea's ready,
I'll bring it through.

43:47.180 --> 43:49.979
Why don't you want her
to phone the police?

43:49.980 --> 43:51.700
I told you...

43:51.740 --> 43:54.219
Alec's meeting us here.
They'll arrest him.

43:54.220 --> 43:58.060
Right.
I'm sorry I shouted in the car.

43:58.100 --> 44:00.379
It's OK. I'm just...

44:00.380 --> 44:02.379
worried about Alec.

44:02.380 --> 44:05.180
And Mum. Sure.

44:05.220 --> 44:06.580
Me too.

44:09.060 --> 44:11.019
Would you...?

44:11.020 --> 44:12.499
Would you say I'm a good dad?

44:12.500 --> 44:14.380
That I've been a good father?

44:15.820 --> 44:16.900
Course.

44:16.940 --> 44:18.380
You love me, don't you?

44:18.420 --> 44:20.220
Dad...? Just...

44:20.947 --> 44:22.507
...tell me. Please.

44:23.562 --> 44:24.711
Yes.

44:24.924 --> 44:26.164
I love you.

44:26.189 --> 44:28.140
And nothing can change that? No.

44:28.180 --> 44:30.180
What's with all the weird questions?

44:34.260 --> 44:36.940
Whatever happens,
whatever people tell you...

44:39.300 --> 44:41.140
...you brought out the good in me.

44:43.020 --> 44:44.580
As a man,

44:44.620 --> 44:46.180
as a father.

44:47.940 --> 44:50.460
Raising you... saved me.

44:51.500 --> 44:52.540
What do you mean?

44:53.980 --> 44:55.860
You gave me something to live for.

44:58.020 --> 44:59.420
What about Mum?

45:00.860 --> 45:02.220
Your mum...

45:03.700 --> 45:05.219
..couldn't help.

45:05.220 --> 45:06.300
Because...

45:07.980 --> 45:09.260
...in so many ways...

45:11.620 --> 45:12.660
...she was to blame.

45:16.700 --> 45:18.620
'You're not looking at...'

45:18.660 --> 45:21.220
'Tonight, police in Surrey have
launched a manhunt

45:21.260 --> 45:23.540
'for the missing GP, Nick Timpson,

45:23.580 --> 45:25.620
'in connection with the murder
of Lucy Chatham.

45:25.660 --> 45:29.340
'She was found dead yesterday
in a pond close to the M25.'

45:30.500 --> 45:31.900
You got the list of his patients?

45:31.940 --> 45:34.540
Yeah, it's a bloody mile long.

45:34.580 --> 45:39.099
I'd prioritise any farms or
residences near farms. Why?

45:39.100 --> 45:43.660
There's what looks... and smells
like slurry under here.

45:43.700 --> 45:45.660
That could've been there for
weeks... Nope.

45:45.700 --> 45:47.940
The mechanics said they cleaned
it inside and out.

45:47.980 --> 45:49.380
These deposits were made today.

45:49.420 --> 45:52.580
'...them immediately. Police say
the man should not be approached.'

46:01.180 --> 46:02.580
Who are you phoning, Grace?

46:04.740 --> 46:06.099
Just a friend.

46:06.100 --> 46:08.260
Which friend? I... I...

46:15.380 --> 46:17.020
Give me the phone, Grace.

46:17.060 --> 46:18.900
No.

46:26.980 --> 46:28.740
Give me the phone.

46:38.580 --> 46:40.379
OK?

46:40.380 --> 46:41.780
Dad. Yes?

46:43.180 --> 46:45.100
Brett and Mum aren't coming,
are they?

46:51.660 --> 46:53.180
What's the matter?

46:53.220 --> 46:54.980
What's going on?

46:56.500 --> 46:58.419
When I was small,
you always said,

46:58.420 --> 47:00.900
"A problem shared
is a problem halved."

47:02.140 --> 47:03.940
Some problems can't be shared.

47:03.980 --> 47:05.940
Look, whatever it is,
I can take it.

47:07.420 --> 47:08.740
I can help you.

47:16.340 --> 47:17.740
Your mum.

47:19.420 --> 47:22.620
She was the best thing
that ever happened to me.

47:22.660 --> 47:23.860
The best thing.

47:25.380 --> 47:27.900
I had to pinch myself that
she was... you know... mine.

47:30.100 --> 47:31.220
But deep down...

47:33.420 --> 47:35.180
...I knew it was too good to be true.

47:36.260 --> 47:39.300
That there'd be... a... a reckoning.

47:40.940 --> 47:42.500
A price to pay.

47:44.780 --> 47:47.019
I just didn't know it
would hurt so much.

47:47.020 --> 47:48.660
What do you mean?

47:50.260 --> 47:51.700
What price?

48:00.220 --> 48:01.620
I love you.

48:01.660 --> 48:02.660
Dad...!

48:04.500 --> 48:05.740
Let's go back to the car.

48:10.380 --> 48:12.380
No! No, no! Stop!

48:13.820 --> 48:15.020
Oh, God...

48:15.060 --> 48:17.260
I told you not to go in there!

48:19.140 --> 48:20.180
Jess...

48:21.980 --> 48:23.419
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

48:25.220 --> 48:27.020
Jess! Talk to me!

48:27.060 --> 48:28.060
Are you OK?

48:29.260 --> 48:31.860
Argh! Argh...

48:36.180 --> 48:37.340
Jess!

48:39.980 --> 48:41.259
Jess!

48:54.260 --> 48:55.659
Nick Timpson, I'm arresting you

48:55.660 --> 48:59.300
on the suspicion of the murders
of Lucy Chatham and Wesley Beale.

49:00.660 --> 49:02.060
You don't have to say anything,

49:02.100 --> 49:04.780
but it may harm your defence if you
do not mention when questioned

49:04.820 --> 49:06.980
something which you later
rely on in court.

49:07.020 --> 49:09.220
Anything you do say
may be given in evidence.

49:11.940 --> 49:13.940
Put him in. Put him in.

49:42.180 --> 49:44.420
I need to take a DNA swab sample.

49:47.460 --> 49:48.940
Of course.

49:56.620 --> 49:57.980
Open your mouth.

50:00.260 --> 50:02.500
I need you to open your mouth.

50:04.500 --> 50:06.100
Open.

50:53.700 --> 50:56.579
I had a chat with
Tina Lunt's stepdad.

50:56.580 --> 50:57.940
All the way from Florida.

50:57.980 --> 51:00.860
Aw. She was more appreciated
than we thought.

51:00.900 --> 51:03.140
That's something.
Yeah, yeah, it is.

51:04.660 --> 51:06.060
God bless Professor Jeffreys, eh?

51:07.300 --> 51:09.500
The forefather of DNA profiling.

51:09.540 --> 51:11.500
I know who he is, Einstein!

51:12.780 --> 51:15.379
Well, this is me.

51:15.380 --> 51:18.260
Oh, I've got something
for you, Maureen. Oh, yeah?

51:29.660 --> 51:31.980
I will have to do some work now,
won't I!

51:34.140 --> 51:35.900
We've got news on your
brother's condition.

51:37.380 --> 51:40.180
He's going to have serious
and lasting injuries,

51:40.220 --> 51:41.340
but he's going to live.

51:43.060 --> 51:44.060
And...

51:45.580 --> 51:47.180
...there's something else.

51:48.580 --> 51:50.740
We've taken Nick's DNA

51:50.780 --> 51:54.019
and it's a match to the man
who raped and murdered Leah Tyler

51:54.020 --> 51:56.260
in Brighton in 1996.

51:56.300 --> 51:59.140
The murder your brother
was charged and acquitted of.

52:01.740 --> 52:02.740
That's impossible.

52:04.140 --> 52:06.180
DNA doesn't lie, I'm afraid.

52:06.220 --> 52:08.539
Now we know why Nick
removed Tina's body.

52:08.540 --> 52:10.020
If he'd called the police,

52:10.060 --> 52:12.700
they'd have processed his car
and found his DNA...

52:12.740 --> 52:14.939
which would have linked him
to Leah's murder.

52:14.940 --> 52:16.740
But Nick wasn't there.

52:16.780 --> 52:18.300
He was in London.

52:20.620 --> 52:23.060
He was doing his finals,
and that's why I...

52:24.900 --> 52:27.579
That's why I came down to see Alec.

52:27.580 --> 52:29.140
'We went out to his club...'

52:29.180 --> 52:30.940
Cheers, mate. Thanks very much.

52:32.980 --> 52:35.380
'...and I met an old
boyfriend there.'

52:35.420 --> 52:36.660
Here we are.

52:51.500 --> 52:53.100
Get a room, you two!

52:53.140 --> 52:55.899
Down the hall on the right.
Where are you going?

52:55.900 --> 52:59.339
Going to get some fags.
Don't do anything I wouldn't do.

52:59.340 --> 53:01.020
'And Nick wasn't there.'

53:02.180 --> 53:03.620
He was in London.

53:05.500 --> 53:07.620
He was doing his finals in London.

53:08.780 --> 53:10.580
Well, clearly he was there.

53:10.620 --> 53:12.180
You just didn't know it.

53:13.260 --> 53:14.740
And the question is,

53:14.780 --> 53:16.220
why didn't you know?

53:18.140 --> 53:20.940
What was the state of your
relationship with Nick at the time?

53:29.100 --> 53:30.780
He was studying every night...

53:30.820 --> 53:32.740
but at the same time, he was...

53:40.420 --> 53:42.300
He was very possessive.

53:47.460 --> 53:48.820
We fell out about it.

55:11.980 --> 55:13.260
Where is he?

55:17.100 --> 55:19.940
WHERE IS HE?! Where is he?!

55:27.460 --> 55:29.900
He's the father of my child.

55:31.780 --> 55:33.380
He's my husband.

55:37.780 --> 55:39.340
How could I not know it?

55:42.580 --> 55:44.340
How could I not see it?

55:47.020 --> 55:49.659
How could I not know?!

55:49.660 --> 55:51.420
How could I not know?

55:58.300 --> 55:59.980
How long has she been in there?

56:00.020 --> 56:02.220
Looks like an indentation of an H.

56:02.260 --> 56:04.460
'Cos there's no way that's
a coincidence, is it?

56:04.500 --> 56:06.460
'Two young women. Two friends.

56:06.500 --> 56:07.859
'It has to be the same killer.'

56:07.860 --> 56:10.540
I wouldn't hurt her, OK?
I never touched her.

56:10.580 --> 56:12.419
That's better! Some reaction!

56:12.420 --> 56:15.220
'You want her to have been
murdered, don't you?'

56:15.260 --> 56:18.860
I want to know the truth.
No. You want to be right.

56:18.900 --> 56:23.420
I will do everything I can
to find her, I promise!
