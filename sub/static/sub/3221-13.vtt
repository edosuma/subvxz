00:04.190 --> 00:05.970
Hello, Dean. What is it you want?

00:06.393 --> 00:07.293
Lucifer's cage.

00:07.594 --> 00:09.084
Sam's soul is stuck in that box.

00:09.462 --> 00:12.122
I can't erase Sam's hell,
but I can put it behind a wall.

00:12.665 --> 00:14.275
Nasty, those memories.

00:14.667 --> 00:16.337
You don't wanna know
what they'll do to him.

00:20.273 --> 00:22.883
Death said he can put up a wall.
You wouldn't remember hell.

00:23.410 --> 00:25.750
- Don't do this.
- Don't scratch the wall.

00:29.215 --> 00:31.405
- You should've told me.
- You weren't supposed to know.

00:31.885 --> 00:33.995
What I did? To Bobby? To you?

00:34.454 --> 00:35.684
Of course I should know.

00:36.022 --> 00:38.482
Sam, Death didn't just shove your
soul back in, okay?

00:38.992 --> 00:40.252
He put up the Great Wall of Sam...

00:40.593 --> 00:42.643
between you
and the things you don't remember.

00:43.096 --> 00:46.136
The things you don't know could kill you.
That's not a joke.

00:46.733 --> 00:49.483
But I have to set things right.
So I need to know what I did.

00:50.670 --> 00:52.810
But you don't know
how dangerous that could be.

00:53.306 --> 00:56.206
- I warned you not to put that inside him.
- What was I supposed to do?

00:56.810 --> 00:59.800
Let me tell you what his soul felt like
when I touched it.

01:00.380 --> 01:02.690
Like it had been skinned alive, Dean.

01:03.183 --> 01:06.173
If you wanted to kill your brother,
you should have done it outright.

01:43.523 --> 01:44.783
- You okay?
- Yeah.

01:45.125 --> 01:47.495
- How's the arm?
- It'll hold till we get out of town.

01:47.994 --> 01:51.864
- Just don't bleed out, all right?
- Ugh, yeah, well, that's the plan.

02:05.812 --> 02:07.512
Cop.

02:30.937 --> 02:31.837
Evening, deputy.

02:32.138 --> 02:34.888
Agent Roark, Agent Wynand,
mind stepping out of the van a moment?

02:39.445 --> 02:41.195
On our way to the office.
Everything okay?

02:41.614 --> 02:43.364
No. I can't get Sheriff Dobbs
on the phone.

02:43.783 --> 02:44.683
I can't get anyone.

02:44.984 --> 02:46.244
We spoke to Dobbs earlier.

02:46.586 --> 02:48.696
- Maybe he's just, uh...
- Is that blood?

02:51.491 --> 02:53.071
Uh, look, there's no need to get riled.

02:53.459 --> 02:55.569
- You're coming with me.
- All right.

02:56.029 --> 02:57.899
- We'll follow you back.
- I don't think so.

02:58.331 --> 03:00.141
Get in my car or you're under arrest.

03:00.567 --> 03:04.347
You're gonna arrest two federal agents?
Really? Ha-ha-ha.

03:06.873 --> 03:08.573
- Have a good night.
- If you think...

03:08.975 --> 03:09.875
Hey, hey, hey. Just...

03:32.332 --> 03:34.822
You think there were maybe calmer ways
we could have done all that?

03:35.335 --> 03:37.035
Do we care?

03:38.371 --> 03:39.601
Let's go.

04:04.797 --> 04:06.407
<i>Prosecutors were getting closer...</i>

04:06.799 --> 04:07.699
<i>to a decision...</i>

04:08.034 --> 04:10.204
<i>on whether to charge the actor.
They denied...</i>

04:11.504 --> 04:14.374
- What are you watching?
- Just trying to catch up.

04:15.808 --> 04:18.238
So Mel Gibson really took a turn
this past year, huh?

04:18.745 --> 04:20.325
Or he's possessed.

04:20.713 --> 04:21.882
Seriously, think about it.

04:23.049 --> 04:25.239
- So I just got off the blower with Bobby.
- Oh, yeah?

04:25.718 --> 04:27.908
He got anything else
on this, uh, Mother of All thing?

04:28.588 --> 04:31.368
Uh, no, nothing solid. He says it's quiet.

04:34.961 --> 04:38.031
- Quiet like quiet, or quiet like too quiet?
- When is it ever just quiet?

04:39.666 --> 04:40.566
Right.

04:43.603 --> 04:44.503
Hmm.

04:44.804 --> 04:46.354
What?

04:49.676 --> 04:51.486
What are these, coordinates?
Who's it from?

04:52.745 --> 04:54.355
I have no idea.

05:01.821 --> 05:03.021
Well?

05:03.356 --> 05:05.106
Uh, Bristol, Rhode Island...

05:05.558 --> 05:07.808
where three women disappeared
in the last week.

05:08.294 --> 05:12.244
Apparently, the, uh, victims
seemed to vanish into thin air.

05:13.866 --> 05:15.736
Could be something.
Who's the text from?

05:16.169 --> 05:18.509
- I don't know. It just kept ringing.
- What's that about?

05:19.005 --> 05:21.725
Could be another hunter,
looking for backup, throwing us a case.

05:22.275 --> 05:25.265
Who knows how many hunters I met
working with the Campbells, you know?

05:25.845 --> 05:28.035
- I think we should go.
- Oh, wait, we're gonna drop everything?

05:28.514 --> 05:31.204
Dude, two minutes ago,
you weren't doing anything.

05:32.218 --> 05:33.648
You got mysterious coordinates...

05:34.020 --> 05:36.390
from a mysterious Mr. X,
leading to a mysterious town?

05:36.889 --> 05:39.519
- That doesn't throw up red flags to you?
- I don't know. Maybe.

05:40.093 --> 05:43.223
But that doesn't mean we can just ignore
a bunch of missing girls.

05:43.830 --> 05:45.260
Right?

05:47.300 --> 05:48.970
Okay. We'll check it out.

05:49.369 --> 05:51.739
But if things get squirrelly,
we dump out, okay?

05:52.238 --> 05:53.548
Yeah.

06:19.365 --> 06:20.675
What?

06:22.568 --> 06:23.998
Nothing.

06:35.214 --> 06:37.324
Well, freak's got a type. Brunettes.

06:38.818 --> 06:39.778
Oh.

06:40.086 --> 06:42.606
This one's got a little bit
of a wild side.

06:43.156 --> 06:45.736
It's all in the eyes, Sam. See it?

06:46.926 --> 06:50.406
Aside from your little deep insight there,
these women have nothing in common.

06:51.431 --> 06:54.621
Different jobs, different friends,
different everything.

06:55.234 --> 06:57.284
- So, what's the connection?
- You figure that out.

06:57.737 --> 06:59.787
I'm gonna go hit the poop deck.

07:11.884 --> 07:13.284
Agent Roark?

07:14.387 --> 07:16.787
It's good to see you again.

07:17.290 --> 07:20.480
- It is?
- Oh, you remember my husband.

07:21.093 --> 07:22.993
- Right.
- Don.

07:23.429 --> 07:25.479
Of course, right. Um, hi.

07:25.932 --> 07:29.592
So you're back
because it started again, right?

07:30.269 --> 07:31.199
The disappearances?

07:34.073 --> 07:36.413
Eh, uh, yeah. Yeah, right. Um.

07:36.909 --> 07:39.719
So if either of you two hear anything,
please let me know.

07:56.229 --> 07:57.489
Where's your partner?

07:59.232 --> 08:00.842
- The big bald guy?
- Heh.

08:01.234 --> 08:02.224
Agent Wynand, right?

08:02.535 --> 08:04.525
- Agent Wynand, of course.
- Sex rehab.

08:05.805 --> 08:07.675
- Yeah, you've heard of plushies, right?
- Heh.

08:08.107 --> 08:10.597
- This is, uh... This is my new partner.
- Hi. Pleasure.

08:11.878 --> 08:13.718
How you doing? Hi.

08:14.146 --> 08:17.396
- Uh, so, agent, we should, uh, tsk.
- Yeah. Yeah, of course.

08:18.017 --> 08:20.797
Of course.
Nice chatting with you, Agent Roark.

08:32.131 --> 08:33.361
Cuff me.

08:37.270 --> 08:38.940
What was that?

08:39.337 --> 08:40.388
She just cougar-eyed you.

08:42.275 --> 08:44.905
I think Samuel and I have worked a case
in this town.

08:46.712 --> 08:48.082
You think?

08:54.687 --> 08:56.437
Come on.
Let's get the hell out of here.

09:02.028 --> 09:04.248
Hey, come on. Hop to, would you?

09:04.997 --> 09:07.277
- We can't go, Dean.
- Uh, yeah, we can.

09:07.800 --> 09:10.760
Five guys went missing a year ago.
They never found the bodies.

09:11.337 --> 09:14.147
I mean, that's gotta be the job
me and Samuel worked, right?

09:14.707 --> 09:17.517
- What difference does it make?
- A year ago, five guys go missing...

09:18.077 --> 09:20.127
and now suddenly
all these women go missing.

09:20.580 --> 09:23.600
Something's here.
So either we just didn't stop it...

09:24.183 --> 09:26.463
or we only thought we did.

09:26.953 --> 09:28.913
Okay. But why the gender bend, huh?

09:29.355 --> 09:32.135
First it's dudes, now it's chicks?
That's a totally different m.o.

09:32.692 --> 09:34.912
I don't know.
The point is, something's still here.

09:35.394 --> 09:37.944
- Call Bobby. He can deal with it.
- Why? We can deal with it.

09:38.464 --> 09:40.424
- Are you serious?
- Ugh.

09:40.866 --> 09:44.326
Sam, there is a reason that hunters
don't hit the same town over again.

09:44.971 --> 09:47.521
- We have a habit of leaving messes.
- Right. I agree.

09:48.040 --> 09:50.560
One of Dad's rules:
You never use the same crapper twice.

09:51.544 --> 09:54.534
- Everyone uses the same crapper twice.
- Not us.

09:55.114 --> 09:56.664
- You know what I mean.
- Okay, look.

09:57.049 --> 09:59.599
Uh, this creature is still walking around
because of me, right?

10:00.119 --> 10:02.749
I mean, I let it go.
Dad also said you finish what you start.

10:05.791 --> 10:06.841
- Okay, I get it.
- Do you?

10:07.159 --> 10:09.269
Yes. You're afraid I'll stroll down
memory lane...

10:09.729 --> 10:13.239
and I'll kick this wall in my head
so hard, hell comes flooding through.

10:13.899 --> 10:15.599
Then I'm some drooling mess
on the floor.

10:16.002 --> 10:19.192
- It's not a joke.
- Okay, I know.

10:19.805 --> 10:22.765
But listen,
what's happening here right now...

10:23.376 --> 10:27.216
it's because I messed up somehow
in some big way.

10:27.913 --> 10:31.953
So every person who gets taken,
every person who dies, that's on me.

10:33.886 --> 10:34.936
I have to stop it.

10:35.921 --> 10:37.381
And you'd do the same thing.

10:43.529 --> 10:44.459
All right.

10:44.764 --> 10:47.574
I'll follow up with the brunettes.
You see what you get from cops.

10:48.134 --> 10:50.884
So you and Nicole were roommates
for a long time.

10:51.437 --> 10:53.987
Since college.
But we've been best friends forever.

10:54.507 --> 10:56.557
- Hmm.
- This whole thing's really surreal.

10:58.711 --> 11:00.521
Are you any closer to finding her, or...?

11:01.480 --> 11:03.560
- We're doing everything we can.
- Yup.

11:06.686 --> 11:08.966
Now, you were with Nicole
the night she went missing.

11:10.222 --> 11:14.852
- Did she say anything?
- Nothing. It's like I told the cops.

11:15.661 --> 11:17.591
I wish there was something.

11:26.138 --> 11:29.358
- Where'd you get this?
- Oh, Nicole got that from that FBI guy.

11:31.343 --> 11:35.443
- Agent Roark. About yea high?
- Yeah, that was him.

11:36.182 --> 11:39.312
One of the men that disappeared
last year lived in our building.

11:39.952 --> 11:40.852
Right.

11:41.153 --> 11:43.643
Agent Roark was asking us all questions
about it, I guess.

11:44.156 --> 11:47.376
You guess? So he came by here?

11:47.993 --> 11:49.953
Oh, he came by a few times.

11:52.264 --> 11:53.554
Did he?

11:53.899 --> 11:55.069
To, uh...

11:55.401 --> 11:58.301
- To speak to Nicole?
- Right.

12:00.706 --> 12:03.076
And how would you characterize
their relationship?

12:03.576 --> 12:05.156
Relationship? They weren't having...

12:05.544 --> 12:08.384
Just the tone
or the nature of their conversation.

12:10.983 --> 12:12.383
Well, loud.

12:14.754 --> 12:17.974
And athletic.

12:34.140 --> 12:36.390
Hold it right there! Stop right there!

12:38.210 --> 12:39.610
Hands where I can see them.

12:40.012 --> 12:41.972
Get in my car or you're under arrest.

12:46.452 --> 12:48.792
Look, no, sir.
Please just hold on for a second.

12:49.288 --> 12:51.278
There's been a misunderstanding.

12:58.664 --> 13:00.944
Man, you are dumb as a sack of hair.

13:01.433 --> 13:03.163
Coming back here after what you did?

13:03.569 --> 13:06.349
- Look, there's been a misunderstanding.
- You are not a damn agent.

13:06.906 --> 13:09.276
- The FBI never heard of you.
- Just listen.

13:09.775 --> 13:10.975
Where are the bodies?

13:12.478 --> 13:14.998
- Mothers wanna bury their loved ones.
- I don't know.

13:15.548 --> 13:17.628
- Where's Sheriff Dobbs?
- I don't know.

13:18.684 --> 13:20.994
You run out of town soaked in blood...

13:21.487 --> 13:24.387
oh, and you bash my brains in
to do it...

13:24.957 --> 13:27.417
and you really expect me
to buy that?

13:28.360 --> 13:30.670
Look, would you believe
that I don't remember anything?

13:31.163 --> 13:32.503
No.

13:32.865 --> 13:35.115
But good luck selling it to the judge.

14:03.863 --> 14:05.413
What happened to my husband?

14:10.970 --> 14:12.900
- Look, I don't know.
- Don't lie to me.

14:13.339 --> 14:16.439
I know who you are, Sam.
I know what you do.

14:17.877 --> 14:19.187
What?

14:21.614 --> 14:23.044
You do?

14:29.822 --> 14:32.452
Let me get this straight.
You're not feds.

14:33.559 --> 14:36.489
- You actually hunt things.
- We know how it sounds.

14:37.062 --> 14:39.082
- Not sure you do.
- You saw those crime scenes.

14:39.531 --> 14:41.781
You think something human
could have taken those guys?

14:42.268 --> 14:44.138
What you're saying, it's impossible.

14:44.570 --> 14:46.940
I don't understand
what she's got to do with any of this.

14:48.841 --> 14:50.681
She's my wife.

14:53.946 --> 14:55.756
She works with me
at the sheriff's station.

14:56.181 --> 14:58.961
You tell something like this to me,
you tell it to her too.

15:01.420 --> 15:03.440
All right, what do you need us to do?

15:07.393 --> 15:09.563
Your husband, he's the sheriff.

15:10.029 --> 15:13.539
Was the sheriff,
until he vanished and you vanished.

15:14.199 --> 15:15.749
What was I supposed to think?

15:16.168 --> 15:19.238
That that thing got him,
or that you killed him?

15:24.276 --> 15:25.616
I just wanna know what happened.

15:26.378 --> 15:27.278
Heh.

15:28.314 --> 15:30.154
So do I, believe me.

15:31.717 --> 15:35.757
Something happened to me.
I have no memory of being here, ever.

15:36.488 --> 15:39.768
<i>What is this, Days of Our Lives?
You're telling me you have amnesia?</i>

15:40.392 --> 15:43.852
If I knew any of this, would I have
stepped foot into this station?

15:45.064 --> 15:46.814
I'm sorry.
I don't even know your name.

15:48.467 --> 15:49.757
If this is some sort of a game...

15:50.102 --> 15:52.442
you're either incredibly clever
or incredibly stupid.

15:52.938 --> 15:54.168
I'm telling the truth.

15:56.842 --> 15:58.212
Uh, look...

15:59.645 --> 16:03.045
I don't know
what happened to your husband.

16:03.716 --> 16:04.646
But I can find out.

16:06.518 --> 16:07.448
How?

16:08.787 --> 16:10.837
If you really know me,
then you know that's my job.

16:11.690 --> 16:13.590
You really don't remember?

16:14.660 --> 16:15.800
No, I really don't.

16:27.272 --> 16:30.522
- I'm Brenna Dobbs.
- Brenna...

16:32.544 --> 16:35.264
I'm sorry about what happened
to your husband.

16:37.783 --> 16:39.713
But I can find answers.

16:41.487 --> 16:43.097
Just not from in here.

16:58.971 --> 17:00.581
Come on. Help me find some rope.

17:00.973 --> 17:03.903
If it's gonna look like a breakout
you're gonna need to tie me up.

17:15.554 --> 17:18.044
What? The boxed stuff
doesn't get better with age, Don.

18:14.046 --> 18:16.386
Hey, Sam. So how does it feel
to be a fugitive again?

18:17.883 --> 18:20.633
- Hate to say "I told you so."
- Uh, you love to say "I told you so."

18:21.186 --> 18:23.146
You're right.
I do love to say "I told you so."

18:23.622 --> 18:26.022
So I found out something
on, heh, Crazy-Eyes McGee.

18:26.825 --> 18:28.725
- Turns out you two knew each other.
- What?

18:29.161 --> 18:30.061
Biblically.

18:30.362 --> 18:33.732
I just spoke to her roommate.
I gotta say, man, you really got around.

18:34.366 --> 18:36.036
Soulless or not, heh,
I'm kind of impressed.

18:36.435 --> 18:37.955
<i>We got a 2057...</i>

18:38.337 --> 18:39.677
<i>2200 block of Hope Street. Over.</i>

18:40.372 --> 18:41.982
Missing person. Another one.

18:42.374 --> 18:45.414
- Okay, all right. I'll go, you stay.
- Yeah. Fine.

18:46.011 --> 18:48.261
- Sam.
- What?

18:48.747 --> 18:50.937
- Stay here.
- Fine. Go.

19:06.031 --> 19:07.961
Listen, thank you for your time.
We're on it.

19:08.400 --> 19:10.300
Yeah. Thanks.

19:13.172 --> 19:14.372
<i>This is Sam.</i>

19:14.706 --> 19:15.606
<i>Leave a message.</i>

19:15.908 --> 19:17.218
Sam, answer the phone, damn it.

19:17.576 --> 19:20.066
I found the connection
between the missing chicks.

19:20.579 --> 19:24.559
They all banged the same dude. You.
It's you, Sam.

19:25.284 --> 19:29.594
The texts, the victims, all of it,
it's a trap for you.

19:30.689 --> 19:32.119
Call me back.

19:43.569 --> 19:44.769
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

19:45.103 --> 19:47.273
- You can't be here.
- Okay, please just listen.

19:47.739 --> 19:50.429
- What happened to Debbie Harris?
- Debbie?

19:51.843 --> 19:54.333
I let you out, and she's just gone.

19:54.846 --> 19:57.866
- And you think I did something to her?
- I don't know what to think.

19:58.450 --> 20:00.940
Look, um, I need your help.

20:01.453 --> 20:02.533
Heh. Are you kidding?

20:04.256 --> 20:07.296
I need the case files your husband made
about the disappearances last year.

20:07.893 --> 20:10.063
So go to the station and find it.

20:11.129 --> 20:14.999
It's not there.
I broke in and I looked, and it's gone.

20:15.734 --> 20:18.164
And I have a theory
about who might have it.

20:19.638 --> 20:23.008
Look, we both want the same thing here,
Brenna, I promise.

20:23.642 --> 20:25.452
We wanna find out what happened
last year...

20:25.877 --> 20:28.507
and we wanna stop what's happening
right now.

20:34.486 --> 20:36.236
The file's upstairs.

20:37.789 --> 20:39.279
I'll be right back.

20:45.797 --> 20:47.287
Let's go!

20:54.906 --> 20:58.946
So you guys just travel all the time?
I mean, you just pick up and go?

21:00.345 --> 21:02.835
- Doesn't that get hard?
- Not when you're young, it's great.

21:03.348 --> 21:07.128
Once you got a family, it's tougher.
Deanna got pregnant.

21:07.819 --> 21:11.129
We didn't know what we were gonna do.
But Mary was...

21:13.058 --> 21:14.138
She was a blessing.

21:16.728 --> 21:19.888
- There's more in the garage.
- Listen, you sit. I'll get it. Ugh.

21:23.702 --> 21:26.662
He misses her.
At least you two have each other.

21:27.239 --> 21:29.289
Well, Samuel wasn't really around
when I was a kid.

21:29.741 --> 21:31.881
We have more
of a, uh, business relationship.

21:32.911 --> 21:34.581
Oh, do you have any other family?

21:37.416 --> 21:39.846
<i>- Family just slows you down.
- Sam?</i>

21:41.219 --> 21:42.679
Sam?

21:43.889 --> 21:46.959
- Are you all right?
- Yeah. Yeah. Um.

21:47.559 --> 21:49.339
All right, let's see what you have.

22:24.730 --> 22:27.250
- Best guess, it came from an Arachne.
- You ever seen one?

22:27.766 --> 22:30.106
No one has. Not outside of Crete
and not for 2000 years.

22:30.602 --> 22:33.442
- What do we even know about them?
- Zip. Uh, just a bunch of guesses...

22:34.005 --> 22:36.195
and a blurry picture
on the side of a Greek vase.

22:36.675 --> 22:38.015
Yeah! Ho, ho!

22:40.045 --> 22:41.095
- Yo, ho, captain.
- Smile.

22:43.315 --> 22:44.865
So we got no clue how to kill
this thing, huh?

22:45.250 --> 22:46.740
Go at it till something sticks.

22:47.119 --> 22:49.929
Well, great. I got an idea
of where it might be, at least.

22:50.489 --> 22:54.089
All the vics have been men in their 30s,
all missing within a two-mile radius.

22:54.993 --> 22:56.833
- So we just kick bushes?
- No, waste of time.

22:57.262 --> 23:00.102
I mean, it's all suburban sprawl,
hundreds of houses at least.

23:00.665 --> 23:01.805
It could be anywhere.

23:03.435 --> 23:05.485
- Lonely Pines Park.
- Yeah.

23:05.937 --> 23:07.987
- I say we make this thing come to us.
- How?

23:13.912 --> 23:18.742
Uh. Hey, um, Brenna, do you mind if I, um,
borrow all this stuff for a couple hours?

23:20.585 --> 23:23.425
Uh, okay, I guess.

23:24.956 --> 23:27.476
You really don't remember Roy, do you?

23:33.565 --> 23:34.825
He was a good man.

23:39.304 --> 23:42.404
I've made peace that he's dead. I have.

23:43.742 --> 23:45.792
But I just wanna know what happened.

23:49.247 --> 23:50.477
I'm sure he died a hero.

24:07.966 --> 24:10.016
<i>Sam, answer the phone, damn it.</i>

24:10.469 --> 24:12.549
<i>I found the connection
between the missing chicks.</i>

24:13.004 --> 24:17.194
<i>They all banged the same dude. You.
It's you, Sam.</i>

24:17.976 --> 24:22.166
<i>The texts, the victims, all of it,
it's a trap for you.</i>

24:23.281 --> 24:24.771
<i>Call me back.</i>

24:47.906 --> 24:48.896
Whoa. Whoa.

24:49.608 --> 24:52.858
I almost shot you. Again.
What the hell?

24:53.512 --> 24:56.322
I figured you'd come and talk to her.
I told you to stay home.

24:56.882 --> 24:58.372
Did you get my message?

24:59.217 --> 25:01.297
Come on, we gotta get you out of here.
Let's go.

25:10.762 --> 25:13.102
So we know that this is a monster
with, uh, opposable thumbs...

25:13.598 --> 25:14.938
and unlimited text messaging.

25:15.333 --> 25:17.703
And we know
that it wants to kill you specifically.

25:18.203 --> 25:20.543
- Does that about cover it?
- It's an Arachne.

25:22.073 --> 25:23.383
A what?

25:25.143 --> 25:27.753
- I remembered.
- You remembered?

25:29.648 --> 25:31.198
I'm sorry, uh, what else have you
remembered?

25:31.583 --> 25:34.573
- Don't worry. It's nothing to do with hell.
- Uh-huh. Not yet, anyway.

25:35.153 --> 25:37.553
What can I do, Dean?
Stuff is just starting to come back.

25:38.056 --> 25:39.576
- Maybe it's natural.
- We're leaving.

25:39.958 --> 25:42.328
- No, we can't.
- We are not the only hunters, okay?

25:42.861 --> 25:44.851
We could call Bobby.
He could come wrap this up.

25:45.297 --> 25:46.937
How? Like you said,
it could be anybody.

25:47.365 --> 25:49.235
- We got jack for leads.
- We know it hates you.

25:49.668 --> 25:52.708
I know who did this.
I just... I can't remember.

25:54.806 --> 25:56.556
I don't think you get
the risk here, Sam.

25:56.975 --> 25:58.235
- Yes, I do.
- Really?

25:58.577 --> 26:02.147
You get that every time you scratch that
wall, you are playing Russian roulette?

26:02.814 --> 26:04.424
I know what you think
is gonna happen.

26:04.816 --> 26:06.806
- But you know what? It will or it won't.
- Sam...

26:07.252 --> 26:11.002
Look, I'm starting to think that I might
have done some bad stuff here, Dean.

26:11.690 --> 26:14.180
I don't care if it's dangerous.
I have to set things right.

26:14.693 --> 26:18.033
I got a frigging soul now,
and it won't let me just walk away.

26:21.633 --> 26:23.383
I'm staying here...

26:23.802 --> 26:25.702
and I need you to back me up.

26:35.280 --> 26:37.180
All right. Why not?

26:38.783 --> 26:41.333
<i>Well, let's Memento this thing,
shall we?</i>

26:47.225 --> 26:49.185
<i>You're back because it
started again, right?</i>

26:49.628 --> 26:50.858
The disappearances?

26:51.196 --> 26:53.336
You're not feds. You actually hunt things.

26:54.866 --> 26:55.976
You really don't remember?

26:58.303 --> 27:01.173
<i>I, uh, found something
on Crazy-Eyes McGee.</i>

27:01.740 --> 27:03.610
Turns out you two knew each other.

27:20.258 --> 27:21.158
Is that blood?

27:23.161 --> 27:24.241
You okay?

27:28.533 --> 27:31.163
That's right.
Yeah, Lonely Pines Park, one hour.

27:31.703 --> 27:32.633
Thanks, Roy.

27:32.971 --> 27:34.671
- All right.
- Are you sure about this?

27:35.073 --> 27:37.063
The Arachne's been snacking
on mid-30s guys.

27:37.509 --> 27:41.349
We need bait that fits the demo.
I'm too young. You're too old.

27:42.047 --> 27:43.477
Eighty-nine and counting.

27:44.215 --> 27:45.825
We should've looped Roy in on the plan.

27:46.217 --> 27:47.677
<i>Do we want a credible performance?</i>

27:48.053 --> 27:51.483
<i>- What if something goes wrong?
- Roy's a big boy. He'll be fine.</i>

27:52.123 --> 27:54.203
It's just not the way
I'm used to doing things.

27:55.627 --> 27:56.827
Got it.

27:57.762 --> 28:00.042
Welcome to the future. Let's go.

28:07.372 --> 28:09.012
Let's hope this thing's hungry.

28:37.402 --> 28:39.362
- Let's split up, look for them.
- It's too late.

28:39.804 --> 28:40.944
- Let's go!
- They're gone, Samuel.

28:41.272 --> 28:42.172
Look, it's okay.

28:42.474 --> 28:45.254
- I turned on the GPS on Roy's cell.
- In English, please?

28:45.810 --> 28:47.680
We can track them back
to wherever she goes.

28:48.413 --> 28:51.073
Roy's just some redshirt to you?
Just spider bait?

28:51.616 --> 28:53.546
No, no, of course not.
This is my backup plan.

28:55.053 --> 28:57.893
My God, son, you're about as cold
as they come, you know that?

28:58.490 --> 29:00.130
Yeah, let's go.

30:07.425 --> 30:08.355
Poor bastard.

30:18.503 --> 30:20.113
Help me.

30:27.846 --> 30:29.986
I can't feel...

30:35.053 --> 30:36.783
Roy, hey, where is she?

31:11.322 --> 31:12.872
Well, I guess decapitation works.

31:15.126 --> 31:16.586
Roy.

31:23.101 --> 31:27.641
You're gonna be okay. Just hang in.
We're gonna get you some help.

31:31.075 --> 31:32.535
If we can get him to the hospital...

31:32.911 --> 31:34.841
- He can't be helped.
- What?

31:35.280 --> 31:37.530
I don't know about Arachne,
but I know about spiders.

31:38.016 --> 31:40.596
One brown-recluse bite can kill you.
This thing?

31:41.119 --> 31:43.429
Look at these guys.
That poison's eating them alive.

31:43.922 --> 31:46.912
- They're just dead men walking.
- So, what are you saying?

31:47.492 --> 31:49.572
I'm saying we put him
out of his misery.

31:54.799 --> 31:57.289
Sam, please.

31:57.802 --> 32:00.552
Killing this thing saved a lot of lives.

32:01.105 --> 32:04.175
We couldn't have done it without you.
You're a hero.

32:33.771 --> 32:36.671
We can't just leave the bodies here.
Get the gasoline.

32:41.512 --> 32:42.412
I know what happened.

33:01.099 --> 33:02.029
Roy?

33:09.941 --> 33:10.841
I love you.

33:15.113 --> 33:17.693
- What are you gonna say to Brenna?
- Relax, Dean.

33:18.216 --> 33:21.146
Hey, Brenna, it's Sam.
I'm just checking in.

33:21.753 --> 33:23.483
Yeah, of course I can swing by.

33:24.255 --> 33:26.915
Okay. Yeah. Bye.

33:27.458 --> 33:29.008
What was that about?

33:30.695 --> 33:32.365
- She wants me to swing by.
- For?

33:33.631 --> 33:34.741
She said it's no big deal.

33:36.567 --> 33:37.937
But I can tell she's in trouble.

33:56.654 --> 33:57.584
Dean, back door.

33:59.624 --> 34:00.884
Sam.

34:01.793 --> 34:02.993
Light's on in the shed.

34:14.739 --> 34:17.079
- My spidey senses are tingling.
- Shh.

34:18.810 --> 34:20.300
Sam?

34:20.678 --> 34:22.348
Brenna?

34:23.880 --> 34:25.081
Hey.

34:31.621 --> 34:32.672
What you did to Roy...

34:35.693 --> 34:37.243
Is it true?

34:49.306 --> 34:51.527
Answer the question, Sam.

35:12.830 --> 35:14.820
You gotta admit, I look good, Sam.
Ha, ha.

35:16.367 --> 35:20.997
- Well, except for your little souvenir.
- You win. I'm here.

35:23.374 --> 35:26.834
Let Brenna go.
This has nothing to do with her.

35:27.879 --> 35:28.869
You come back around...

35:30.314 --> 35:32.864
start hanging out with my wife...

35:33.384 --> 35:35.434
and you think
this has nothing to do with her?

35:36.654 --> 35:40.114
But then, you thought
I was out of the way, right?

35:40.758 --> 35:43.508
I gotta say,
you get a hell of a lot wrong, Sam,

35:44.362 --> 35:47.432
Like that thing you threw me to.

35:48.032 --> 35:49.842
You thought it was here to feed.

35:50.268 --> 35:51.908
- She was here to breed.
- Yeah.

35:52.937 --> 35:56.367
That thing was playing the mating game,
and I guess I fit her profile.

35:57.341 --> 36:01.321
Me and all those other poor bastards.
She bit us to turn us into what she was.

36:06.951 --> 36:10.761
By the time you pulled that trigger,
I wasn't human.

36:11.522 --> 36:12.892
Not anymore.

36:14.292 --> 36:15.602
So bullets didn't hurt me much.

36:20.031 --> 36:21.811
Oh, and neither did fire.

36:23.534 --> 36:26.084
So after you left, well, we ran.

36:27.805 --> 36:30.265
Me, I hid for months, nearly starved.

36:31.375 --> 36:32.955
But you know what kept me going?

36:36.380 --> 36:38.570
Every night,
I dreamed about ripping your throat out.

36:39.684 --> 36:42.644
I thought I was sending you
a neon sign. The text?

36:43.221 --> 36:46.381
Taking all those girls you screwed?
I was kicking so much sand in your eye.

36:46.991 --> 36:49.421
I couldn't figure out
why you weren't getting it.

36:51.596 --> 36:53.706
Then Bren tells me
you've got brain damage.

36:54.198 --> 36:56.038
It's just too good.

36:57.501 --> 36:59.641
Where are they, Roy? The women.

37:00.104 --> 37:02.884
Scattered in the wind.

37:03.474 --> 37:04.874
They're like me now.

37:06.410 --> 37:08.810
You killed one monster,
you made so many more.

37:09.313 --> 37:11.013
Congratulations.

37:11.949 --> 37:14.119
The only question is: Do I kill you...

37:16.821 --> 37:17.811
or turn you?

37:30.001 --> 37:31.781
No. Roy, stop.

38:14.045 --> 38:15.415
Brenna.

38:17.648 --> 38:20.548
Look, I am so sorry.

38:25.623 --> 38:27.523
Brenna, uh, I mean, I...

38:47.411 --> 38:48.841
You okay?

38:50.348 --> 38:51.838
You were right.

38:52.650 --> 38:54.400
We shouldn't have come back here.

38:56.787 --> 38:59.097
Well, you did kill, uh, the spider man.

39:00.925 --> 39:03.645
So you're suggesting
what I did back there was a good thing?

39:04.195 --> 39:05.775
- I'm just saying...
- What?

39:10.067 --> 39:14.987
Sam, you gotta understand
that all that crap last year, all of it...

39:15.840 --> 39:17.590
- none of it was you.
- Heh.

39:18.642 --> 39:21.162
Let's be crystal clear, okay?

39:21.679 --> 39:22.849
It was me.

39:28.185 --> 39:29.965
Well, can I get you anything?

39:31.088 --> 39:32.348
What are you now, my waitress?

39:32.690 --> 39:35.560
I'm just trying to make you feel better.
Don't be a bitch.

39:38.162 --> 39:39.802
Yeah, I'm fine.

39:41.832 --> 39:43.642
Yeah, you look fine.

39:44.602 --> 39:47.182
All I'm saying is,
everything is gonna be okay.

39:47.705 --> 39:49.045
I don't know, Dean.

39:49.407 --> 39:51.157
If I did this here,
then who knows how many other...?

39:55.012 --> 39:56.712
Sammy? Sammy?

39:58.349 --> 39:59.339
Sammy, talk to me.
