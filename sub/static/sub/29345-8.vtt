WEBVTT

00:02.970 --> 00:04.772
(whimpers, crying)

00:04.805 --> 00:05.839
(screams)

00:05.873 --> 00:08.008
ANNOUNCER: AHS 1984.

00:08.042 --> 00:10.811
All new,
Wednesdays at 10:00 on FX.

00:12.012 --> 00:13.147
(motors revving)

00:13.181 --> 00:16.850
ANNOUNCER: FX presents Mayans.

00:18.018 --> 00:20.354
- Previously
on "Mayans M.C."...

00:20.388 --> 00:22.456
- I thought Jax wanted you guys
out of the gun business.

00:22.490 --> 00:25.159
- Transition's taking longer
than we thought.

00:25.193 --> 00:26.660
- Hey, wait, wait.
- Oh. Ow.

00:26.694 --> 00:29.063
- W-what the fuck?
Who did this?

00:29.097 --> 00:32.032
- They were bikers.
Patches said Vatos Malditos.

00:32.066 --> 00:35.002
- A long time ago,
I patched the VM.

00:35.035 --> 00:36.670
Started with petty stuff.

00:36.704 --> 00:38.806
Then El Palo
became the shot caller.

00:38.839 --> 00:41.642
Took a turn, got dark.

00:41.675 --> 00:43.010
- Your Spanish is colloquial.

00:43.043 --> 00:45.746
- I learned from an angel
in Coatzacoalcos.

00:45.779 --> 00:48.982
- Where's that angel now?

00:49.016 --> 00:52.520
- Have the NSA, ICE,
and our friends at CISEN

00:52.553 --> 00:54.855
pull everything they have
on those two names.

00:54.888 --> 00:56.824
- Nestor.
- What's up, Mikey?

00:56.857 --> 00:59.727
- Keep me posted
when and where my wife goes.

00:59.760 --> 01:01.829
- 24-7?
- Yes.

01:01.862 --> 01:04.865
- If there's anything I can do,
please just let me know.

01:08.502 --> 01:11.605
- Em, there might be something
you can help me with.

01:14.942 --> 01:17.077
It's a family thing.

02:57.245 --> 02:58.679
- Jesus.

03:10.524 --> 03:12.593
- That thing's gonna
make you stupid.

03:12.626 --> 03:15.496
- Yeah.

03:15.529 --> 03:17.431
Might be too late.

03:27.241 --> 03:28.676
- When's the vote?

03:32.346 --> 03:33.747
- End of the week.

03:37.251 --> 03:38.652
- It's your life.

03:38.686 --> 03:41.722
Whatever choices you make...

03:41.755 --> 03:43.090
I'm here, son.

03:44.892 --> 03:46.294
- I know, Pop.

03:55.636 --> 03:57.738
- You know all these books
smell like cow's blood, right?

03:57.771 --> 04:01.809
- You know you're supposed to
read them not smell them, right?

04:01.842 --> 04:03.744
- Blow me.

04:03.777 --> 04:05.613
- Love you, Pop.

04:07.214 --> 04:08.982
- Bish called.

04:09.016 --> 04:10.718
I'm at the table.

04:10.751 --> 04:13.454
- I'll catch up.

04:34.608 --> 04:36.577
- Hello?
EZ?

04:36.610 --> 04:37.911
- Yeah.

04:49.923 --> 04:52.259
- Excuse me.
Are the bathrooms back there?

04:52.292 --> 04:54.395
- Yes.
First door.

05:14.948 --> 05:16.417
- Hey.
- Hey.

05:16.450 --> 05:17.551
- Is this okay?

05:17.585 --> 05:20.287
- Yeah.
I only have a minute.

05:20.320 --> 05:23.891
- Did you find anything?

05:23.924 --> 05:26.594
- When you asked me to do this,

05:26.627 --> 05:29.930
I didn't say anything
or question it.

05:29.963 --> 05:31.999
I owed you the favor.

05:33.967 --> 05:37.371
- You found something.

05:37.405 --> 05:41.442
- Two weeks ago, in Dita's room,

05:41.475 --> 05:44.878
a photo of Felipe
and José Galindo.

05:46.780 --> 05:48.416
Did you know your father
worked for the--

05:48.449 --> 05:50.283
- Yes.

05:50.317 --> 05:53.487
He's Policía Federal...

05:53.521 --> 05:56.156
on Galindo's payroll,
lifetime ago.

05:57.858 --> 06:01.862
- Wh--
Is that what this is?

06:01.895 --> 06:05.966
So what, something
between Felipe and José?

06:05.999 --> 06:07.635
What, something personal?

06:10.337 --> 06:12.640
I am part of this now, EZ.

06:14.241 --> 06:16.844
Things with Miguel--

06:16.877 --> 06:19.713
If he knew I was here
with you...

06:22.883 --> 06:24.885
Please,
just tell me the truth.

06:31.191 --> 06:34.027
The money transfers--

06:34.061 --> 06:36.564
the amounts you're looking up--

06:36.597 --> 06:39.332
they were used to hire a gunman

06:39.366 --> 06:41.401
to kill my parents.

06:46.574 --> 06:49.376
- Marisol?
- And Pop, too.

06:52.813 --> 06:54.815
- No.
That can't be right.

07:00.153 --> 07:03.757
I loved your mom.
- She loved you, Em.

07:03.791 --> 07:06.359
- EZ...

07:06.393 --> 07:09.697
the Galindos couldn't have.

07:09.730 --> 07:12.833
They had nothing to do
with what happened.

07:12.866 --> 07:14.267
That's insane.

07:14.301 --> 07:16.870
- Em, you know me.

07:16.904 --> 07:19.072
I wouldn't be here
if I wasn't sure.

07:19.106 --> 07:20.674
I've already thought about this
way too much.

07:20.708 --> 07:22.610
- About what?

07:30.718 --> 07:32.786
- I think...

07:32.820 --> 07:37.725
Ignacio Cortina
did something bad.

07:37.758 --> 07:39.527
Pissed off José Galindo.

07:39.560 --> 07:43.096
That's why Mom and Pop fled.

07:43.130 --> 07:45.733
Started fresh here...

07:45.766 --> 07:47.768
far enough away from Sonora

07:47.801 --> 07:51.138
but close enough
to check in with family.

07:53.306 --> 07:56.409
Then when Miguel moved
to Santo Padre after Cornell,

07:56.443 --> 07:58.946
that's when he found them--

07:58.979 --> 08:01.549
now Marisol and Felipe Reyes.

08:01.582 --> 08:03.283
- No.

08:03.316 --> 08:04.484
No.

08:04.518 --> 08:06.654
Miguel had nothing
to do with this.

08:06.687 --> 08:10.123
He didn't touch the business
until after José died.

08:12.125 --> 08:14.094
I know Miguel.

08:14.127 --> 08:16.597
He is...

08:16.630 --> 08:20.400
he is not the person
who destroyed your family.

08:20.433 --> 08:22.302
- Destroyed us, Em.

08:22.335 --> 08:25.238
Our future.
Our baby.

08:25.272 --> 08:27.440
Then he fucking married you--

08:27.474 --> 08:30.143
Stop it.

08:30.177 --> 08:31.979
Stop it.

08:41.689 --> 08:44.157
- Look...

08:44.191 --> 08:46.526
let's just...

08:46.560 --> 08:48.796
let's just keep this
with what we know.

08:52.866 --> 08:55.468
The amounts I gave you--

08:55.502 --> 08:57.871
did you find anything?

08:57.905 --> 08:59.306
- And what if I did...

08:59.339 --> 09:01.341
find something,
then what?

09:03.677 --> 09:05.512
José is dead.

09:08.215 --> 09:10.117
Why are you doing this, EZ?

09:13.553 --> 09:16.556
- Please tell me.

09:16.590 --> 09:19.126
- You're wrong.
- Tell me, Em.

09:19.159 --> 09:21.428
- You're wrong,
and I'll prove it.

09:23.163 --> 09:24.665
- Em.

09:45.653 --> 09:48.756
- * Mother of exiles

09:48.789 --> 09:50.724
* The torch of hope

09:50.758 --> 09:53.661
* In the toss of the tempest

09:53.694 --> 09:56.396
* Threw us Madison's rope

09:56.429 --> 09:58.732
* But the brazen giant

09:58.766 --> 10:01.601
* With limbs astride

10:01.635 --> 10:04.772
* Blocks the golden door

10:04.805 --> 10:08.541
* To the U.S. of Lies

10:08.575 --> 10:12.612
* Damn your huddled masses

10:12.646 --> 10:15.548
* Scrub our floors

10:15.582 --> 10:17.851
* Cut our grasses

10:17.885 --> 10:20.854
* I am a wolf

10:20.888 --> 10:23.456
* A wild cur

10:23.490 --> 10:25.693
* Cut from the pack

10:26.927 --> 10:29.562
* With blood on my fur

10:29.596 --> 10:32.232
* Every howl

10:32.265 --> 10:34.968
* Marks the debt

10:35.002 --> 10:38.571
* 'Cause a beaten dog

10:39.940 --> 10:43.510
* Never forgets

10:43.543 --> 10:46.146
* Every howl

10:46.179 --> 10:48.949
* Marks the debt

10:48.982 --> 10:53.787
* 'Cause a beaten dog

10:53.821 --> 10:56.623
* Never forgets

10:59.359 --> 11:02.362
* Never forgets

11:13.506 --> 11:15.108
- Chibs say why
they had to push it up?

11:15.142 --> 11:18.145
- No, just that
they've run out of time.

11:18.178 --> 11:20.313
We need to take control
of the gun trade now,

11:20.347 --> 11:21.715
or we could lose it.

11:21.749 --> 11:23.416
- The meet's set.

11:23.450 --> 11:25.585
Flying Serpent Lodge.
8:00 p.m.

11:25.618 --> 11:27.654
Skint'll do it right.

11:27.687 --> 11:29.489
- No casino?

11:29.522 --> 11:31.291
- That many patches at a table,

11:31.324 --> 11:33.460
I thought we might want
a quieter place

11:33.493 --> 11:35.128
off the main strip.

11:35.162 --> 11:36.629
We're still covered
by tribal law.

11:36.663 --> 11:38.866
- Moving guns.

11:38.899 --> 11:41.301
Won't that land
on Northern Cali?

11:41.334 --> 11:42.702
Why are we doing this?

11:42.736 --> 11:44.604
- Yeah.
No disrespect.

11:44.637 --> 11:46.874
I know you got to be there.
Kings make the call.

11:46.907 --> 11:50.677
But we got enough shit
going on down here.

11:50.710 --> 11:53.646
- SAMCRO asked for our charter
at the table.

11:53.680 --> 11:56.583
- This is one of Jax Teller's
last requests.

11:56.616 --> 11:59.686
We got to represent.

11:59.719 --> 12:02.890
- I'll reach out to Charming,
tell them it's a go.

12:02.923 --> 12:04.557
- I'll make the ride
through calls.

12:04.591 --> 12:06.426
- Good.

12:06.459 --> 12:09.930
Problems of abundance.

12:21.274 --> 12:24.144
- What's up?
- Heard from Emily.

12:24.177 --> 12:26.246
- What?

12:26.279 --> 12:29.049
She found an old picture.

12:29.082 --> 12:30.683
Galindo's mother had it.

12:30.717 --> 12:32.886
Pop and José Galindo.

12:32.920 --> 12:35.222
Emily knows
he worked for the cartel.

12:35.255 --> 12:36.423
- Jesus.

12:36.456 --> 12:39.592
- I had to tell her the truth...

12:39.626 --> 12:41.661
why we needed to find
the source of the transfers.

12:41.694 --> 12:44.264
- Fuck.
That was a risk, man.

12:44.297 --> 12:45.765
- I know.

12:45.799 --> 12:48.201
What'd she find?

12:48.235 --> 12:52.005
She wouldn't tell me.

12:52.039 --> 12:54.707
She couldn't wrap her head
around Galindo--

12:54.741 --> 12:58.245
Galindo's family
being part of Mom's murder.

12:58.278 --> 12:59.746
- Shit.

12:59.779 --> 13:01.081
- Sorry.

13:10.090 --> 13:12.592
- I fucking hate this guy.

13:31.411 --> 13:32.812
- Morning.

13:35.015 --> 13:36.616
- Morning.

13:39.752 --> 13:41.754
You okay?

13:41.788 --> 13:43.123
- Yeah.

13:43.156 --> 13:44.757
I just couldn't sleep.

13:44.791 --> 13:46.994
- Yes, you were
up and out so early.

13:47.027 --> 13:49.429
- Yes.
I went to storage.

13:49.462 --> 13:52.532
I still can't find that article
with my dad's quote.

13:52.565 --> 13:54.334
And then I had
to get my nails done.

13:54.367 --> 13:56.103
- Well, that's not
the best outfit

13:56.136 --> 14:00.840
to go digging around
old boxes, sweetheart.

14:00.874 --> 14:04.311
- No, it wasn't.

14:04.344 --> 14:06.113
I have to change.

14:06.146 --> 14:09.182
Where are you today?

14:09.216 --> 14:11.218
She has the shrink.

14:12.485 --> 14:14.621
- Flores Pequeñas.
Couple meetings.

14:14.654 --> 14:16.123
But I can take her.
- Thanks.

14:16.156 --> 14:18.825
I-I should be able
to pick her up.

14:21.694 --> 14:23.696
I thought this was okay.

14:25.999 --> 14:27.367
- Yeah.

14:27.400 --> 14:29.669
I'm glad they didn't disclose
what happened with the bids--

14:29.702 --> 14:33.040
you know,
the whole Marlon mess.

14:33.073 --> 14:36.343
- Why would they?
It was ruled a suicide.

14:36.376 --> 14:38.845
I wish they mentioned
our employment stats,

14:38.878 --> 14:41.714
you know, show how many mouths
we actually feed.

14:41.748 --> 14:44.284
- Well, there'll be
more coverage.

14:44.317 --> 14:46.853
- I know. Well, that's why
I want to find the quote.

14:46.886 --> 14:49.156
It'd be perfect
for the groundbreaking.

14:49.189 --> 14:50.857
- Mm.

14:52.725 --> 14:55.195
- I'll make us dinner?

14:55.228 --> 14:57.264
- Yeah.
That'll be nice.

15:31.731 --> 15:33.233
Stay with her.

16:00.293 --> 16:03.796
- Los hermanos Reyes.

16:07.334 --> 16:10.137
Fearlessly feasting
on rotted flesh.

16:10.170 --> 16:13.440
Pure instincts--

16:13.473 --> 16:16.643
turning decay into sustenance,

16:16.676 --> 16:17.844
life into death--

16:17.877 --> 16:21.348
- What the fuck do you want?

16:23.383 --> 16:25.885
Seems our, uh...

16:25.918 --> 16:28.588
our fates are entwined...

16:28.621 --> 16:30.923
and here we are again
in need of each other.

16:33.626 --> 16:35.095
We don't need you.

16:35.128 --> 16:36.896
- Of course you do.

16:48.941 --> 16:51.044
- You don't know shit about us.

16:51.078 --> 16:52.612
And you wouldn't know
a familia fuerte

16:52.645 --> 16:54.814
if it crawled up your skinny,
psychotic ass.

16:56.416 --> 16:59.352
Sadly, there is truth in that.

16:59.386 --> 17:04.357
My relationship with Edward was,
at best, tense.

17:05.392 --> 17:08.861
Lone military brat
up against a full bird

17:08.895 --> 17:10.763
with a fifth of Cutty.

17:10.797 --> 17:12.165
Ooh-la-la.

17:12.199 --> 17:13.466
- Yeah, man,
we've all lived through

17:13.500 --> 17:14.967
the after-school special.

17:15.001 --> 17:16.503
- Why mention our father?

17:16.536 --> 17:20.039
This have something to do
with you showing up at the shop?

17:20.073 --> 17:22.975
- That is why
we need each other, Ezekiel--

17:23.009 --> 17:24.611
for the sake of our fathers.

17:24.644 --> 17:27.547
- Oh, this'll be good.

17:27.580 --> 17:29.382
- You see,

17:29.416 --> 17:31.651
I want to make
the colonel proud.

17:31.684 --> 17:35.054
Solve the big rebellion puzzle.

17:35.088 --> 17:36.723
But to do that,
I need to know the truth

17:36.756 --> 17:38.558
about what happened
in the desert.

17:40.026 --> 17:42.595
And you two,

17:42.629 --> 17:45.532
you need to make
your padre proud,

17:45.565 --> 17:47.500
and to do that,
you'll have to save

17:47.534 --> 17:51.838
Ignacio Cortina
from being deported.

17:51.871 --> 17:54.073
- You fucking cunt.
- Hey, hey, no, no!

17:54.107 --> 17:56.876
Hey!
Don't let him get to you!

17:56.909 --> 17:58.378
- Good advice, brother.

18:02.449 --> 18:04.417
- Tell us
what the fuck you want,

18:04.451 --> 18:05.718
or I'll pull my gun,

18:05.752 --> 18:07.354
and while the suits
take me down,

18:07.387 --> 18:09.189
he'll cut your
fucking heart out.

18:13.426 --> 18:16.596
- Whether you're
inside his circle or not,

18:16.629 --> 18:19.166
you had proximity to the cartel

18:19.199 --> 18:21.033
and to señor Galindo.

18:21.067 --> 18:23.703
So my question is
to you, gentlemen,

18:23.736 --> 18:26.739
how far does the ruse go?

18:28.808 --> 18:30.577
How far?

18:40.086 --> 18:43.423
You will tell me everything.

18:43.456 --> 18:45.258
Rebels, Adelita,

18:45.292 --> 18:47.394
Galindo, Palomo,
all the pieces--

18:47.427 --> 18:51.298
tangible truth
supported by evidence.

18:51.331 --> 18:52.532
If not,

18:52.565 --> 18:56.403
I'll have ICE pick up
Felipe Reyes,

18:56.436 --> 18:59.939
an illegal immigrant
with a violent past.

18:59.972 --> 19:03.376
He'll be locked away in one of
our fabulous detention centers.

19:03.410 --> 19:06.145
And we all know
what happens there, don't we?

19:07.914 --> 19:10.217
What if there's no more truth?

19:10.250 --> 19:12.419
You have everything
that you want.

19:16.155 --> 19:18.791
- There's always more truth, EZ.

19:22.429 --> 19:24.997
I will give you
a few days to, uh,

19:25.031 --> 19:27.099
figure out how to play it.

19:29.135 --> 19:32.038
I'll do what I can to keep
all the Reyes men alive.

19:42.249 --> 19:46.185
He's done it again.

19:46.219 --> 19:48.955
He's fucking played us.

19:48.988 --> 19:52.325
- No, not yet.
Not yet. Hey.

19:52.359 --> 19:54.026
Hey, fuck this guy.

19:55.528 --> 19:57.129
- He's not gonna
break up your family

19:57.163 --> 19:58.265
or our family.

19:58.298 --> 19:59.832
You hear me?

19:59.866 --> 20:02.535
He doesn't win.
Not again.

20:07.106 --> 20:09.075
Hey!

20:09.108 --> 20:10.543
He doesn't win.

20:15.482 --> 20:19.051
Yeah.

20:19.085 --> 20:20.920
Come on, we got a long ride.

20:20.953 --> 20:23.556
Gives us time to think.

21:12.204 --> 21:13.373
- No.

21:54.814 --> 21:56.883
- Everybody's here.

21:56.916 --> 21:58.885
- Hey, brother.
- Raza.

22:00.653 --> 22:02.288
- Good to see you, brother.

22:02.321 --> 22:05.324
Good to see you, brother.

22:07.259 --> 22:09.496
- Where you think
you going, snitch?

22:09.529 --> 22:12.465
- What?
You forget what you did?

22:12.499 --> 22:14.200
- Yeah, well,
Ticker was my primo.

22:14.233 --> 22:17.303
- He was also a lying thief.

22:17.336 --> 22:19.772
I wouldn't lead with that part
of the family tree, Ganso.

22:19.806 --> 22:22.274
- Let a patch
have an opinion, man.

22:22.308 --> 22:25.011
He ain't your brother here.
He's a fucking noob.

22:25.044 --> 22:26.713
- Hey.

22:26.746 --> 22:28.748
Fuck that fat little burrito.

22:33.553 --> 22:35.422
- This is perfect, Adam.
- Good, good.

22:35.455 --> 22:38.357
The south room should be able
to handle your meeting.

22:38.391 --> 22:40.026
Same protocol.
My guys are around.

22:40.059 --> 22:42.061
Just let them know
if you need anything, all right?

22:48.501 --> 22:50.503
Bishop, how are you?

22:50.537 --> 22:52.539
- Good to see you, brother.
- Good to see you, too.

22:58.911 --> 23:00.346
- Dita.

23:02.715 --> 23:04.183
- Ignacio.

23:07.687 --> 23:10.523
-  I'm a little too old
to be discreet.

23:10.557 --> 23:13.392
Your son's gonna find out
that we've been talking.

23:15.194 --> 23:18.197
- Perhaps,
but we're almost done.

23:21.167 --> 23:23.202
- Done with what?

23:23.235 --> 23:25.872
What are we doing, Dita?

24:12.451 --> 24:14.086
I'm sorry.

24:16.288 --> 24:18.457
I loved you...

24:18.491 --> 24:21.293
at first.

24:21.327 --> 24:25.331
But it was wrong and dangerous
for the both of us.

24:29.335 --> 24:31.538
I tried to end it many times,

24:31.571 --> 24:33.606
but you would not listen.

24:33.640 --> 24:37.276
- Because you fell in love
with someone else...

24:37.309 --> 24:39.145
Isabel Varela.

24:41.080 --> 24:42.515
Village girl.

24:42.549 --> 24:44.751
- Yes.

24:44.784 --> 24:46.519
Marisol.

24:48.320 --> 24:51.524
- It's so sad, Felipe.

24:51.558 --> 24:53.059
- I know.

24:53.092 --> 24:55.695
And I'm very sorry
that I hurt you.

26:08.434 --> 26:11.037
Fuck me.

26:25.251 --> 26:28.855
- You have reached
the voice mailbox of--

26:37.196 --> 26:40.232
- She's not picking up.

26:43.636 --> 26:46.072
What the fuck
are we gonna do, bro?

26:49.308 --> 26:51.110
- We'll know when we know.

26:54.413 --> 26:56.916
- You got to stop praying
in the church of Coco, man.

26:56.949 --> 26:58.450
It's freaking me out.

27:14.834 --> 27:16.335
Reaper's here.

27:16.368 --> 27:19.238
- * See that stranger

27:19.271 --> 27:21.908
* Coming over here

27:21.941 --> 27:24.576
* Though you don't
recognize him *

27:24.610 --> 27:26.278
* I know your preacher will

27:32.518 --> 27:36.655
- So who do we got to fuck
to get a drink around here?

27:38.590 --> 27:40.727
- Bish.

27:40.760 --> 27:41.894
- Hey.

28:06.518 --> 28:08.487
- You have reached
the voice mailbox--

28:12.458 --> 28:14.260
- We never thought

28:14.293 --> 28:17.629
this transition
would've taken so long.

28:17.663 --> 28:20.532
Things up in Northern Cali
are just only settled down.

28:20.566 --> 28:22.368
And our other interests--

28:22.401 --> 28:25.171
it's finally starting
to land in the black.

28:25.204 --> 28:27.706
- We've had a few
sea changes ourselves.

28:27.740 --> 28:29.675
- Oh, yeah.

28:29.708 --> 28:31.510
How is El Padrino?

28:31.543 --> 28:34.480
- Settling into the suit.

28:34.513 --> 28:36.148
- Shit we had going--

28:36.182 --> 28:40.186
we haven't made, uh, the handoff
an easy task.

28:40.219 --> 28:42.554
- Well, the North Cali
Port Authority

28:42.588 --> 28:45.191
has made that decision
for all of us.

28:45.224 --> 28:48.027
They're closing down
Mendocino port,

28:48.060 --> 28:52.498
which means the Irish will have
nowhere to bring their guns.

28:52.531 --> 28:54.333
Shit.

28:54.366 --> 28:56.969
- How long?

28:57.003 --> 29:00.072
- Two weeks.

29:00.106 --> 29:02.174
There's one more shipment
on the way.

29:02.208 --> 29:03.575
That arrives Tuesday.

29:03.609 --> 29:05.845
After that...

29:05.878 --> 29:07.479
we get nada.

29:07.513 --> 29:11.217
- That explains the urgency.

29:11.250 --> 29:13.552
- The Irish are nervous.

29:13.585 --> 29:16.122
They're already looking
for new dealers.

29:18.624 --> 29:20.492
I'm sorry we're dropping
all this shit in your laps

29:20.526 --> 29:23.729
right now,
but it's just the way it is.

29:23.762 --> 29:27.433
- You want to bring them south.

29:27.466 --> 29:29.902
That's why my crew is here.

29:29.936 --> 29:31.303
- Aye.

29:31.337 --> 29:33.105
- Russians run Long Beach.

29:33.139 --> 29:35.374
San Diego's a naval clusterfuck.

29:38.677 --> 29:41.213
- Farther south, brother--
Mexico.

29:41.247 --> 29:43.715
We have contacts in Tijuana--

29:43.749 --> 29:46.785
An MC down there
runs the port.

29:46.819 --> 29:48.754
- The Vatos Malditos.

29:48.787 --> 29:51.423
- Cabrones, man.

29:53.960 --> 29:55.661
- Shit.

29:58.330 --> 29:59.765
- What?

29:59.798 --> 30:03.235
- We just had a little
a run-in with the VM.

30:03.269 --> 30:04.703
Didn't end well.

30:04.736 --> 30:07.006
- Well, fuck.

30:07.039 --> 30:09.741
- Look,
El Palo is a friend of mine.

30:09.775 --> 30:11.743
He didn't mention it
when we talked.

30:11.777 --> 30:13.579
- You talked to them already?

30:13.612 --> 30:17.683
- Yeah, I had to make sure
we could make a deal.

30:17.716 --> 30:19.218
They're coming up here.

30:19.251 --> 30:21.420
- Are you fucking kidding me?

30:21.453 --> 30:23.990
- Easy.
- Hey, look.

30:24.023 --> 30:26.758
If Palo didn't say anything
about a beef,

30:26.792 --> 30:29.495
that means he's willing
to sit down.

30:29.528 --> 30:32.798
Okay, nothing's gonna go
off the rails with us here.

30:32.831 --> 30:34.466
You got my word.

30:34.500 --> 30:38.170
- Aye.

30:38.204 --> 30:40.472
This bad blood...

30:40.506 --> 30:42.774
it ain't historical.

30:42.808 --> 30:44.410
It just happened.

30:47.046 --> 30:50.682
You can sort
this kind of shit out.

30:50.716 --> 30:52.551
Come on.

30:54.086 --> 30:57.523
There's a lot of money
on the table here, gentlemen.

30:57.556 --> 30:59.558
I'm sure we can put
a deal together

30:59.591 --> 31:02.561
where we all come out whole.

31:16.075 --> 31:18.844
- You bring them to the table.

31:18.877 --> 31:21.813
They're willing to talk...

31:21.847 --> 31:24.316
we're willing to listen.

31:24.350 --> 31:27.353
- It's a beautiful thing.
That's all we wanted.

31:57.783 --> 31:59.685
- Señorita Palomo.

31:59.718 --> 32:01.520
- Señor Galindo.

32:59.711 --> 33:01.280
- Mm-hmm.

34:10.916 --> 34:13.085
- Hey, when you're done
filling those up,

34:13.119 --> 34:15.421
why don't you hit ours, too?

34:18.257 --> 34:19.491
- That's not gonna happen.

34:19.525 --> 34:21.493
The fuck did you say?

34:23.829 --> 34:25.731
- Clear it with my sponsor.

34:25.764 --> 34:29.067
- Well, fuck that, bitch.

34:29.101 --> 34:31.337
Buy us gas
and fill our tanks.

34:31.370 --> 34:32.738
- Pick up your money.

34:32.771 --> 34:34.206
- Hey, this don't concern you.

34:34.240 --> 34:36.575
- Yes, it does.
Get lost.

34:36.608 --> 34:38.744
- Are you choosing a prospect
over a patch?

34:38.777 --> 34:42.414
- Nah, we're choosing
a brother just doing his job

34:42.448 --> 34:44.350
over two lames.

34:44.383 --> 34:46.452
- Take it easy.

34:48.554 --> 34:51.290
- I'm feeling a little
burnt out from the ride.

34:51.323 --> 34:52.858
Hey, prospect, do me favor.

34:52.891 --> 34:54.193
- Yeah?

34:54.226 --> 34:55.627
- Fuck this bitch up.

34:58.997 --> 35:00.732
- Oh, shit.

35:00.766 --> 35:03.602
- Oh, man.
Big mistake, prospect.

35:05.504 --> 35:08.440
All right.

35:21.453 --> 35:23.789
- What the fuck?
He can't hit a patch.

35:23.822 --> 35:26.425
- Can if I tell him to.

35:26.458 --> 35:28.660
- That's fucked, man.
He put fucking hands on us.

35:28.694 --> 35:30.128
- Just obeying orders.

35:30.162 --> 35:31.397
- Bullshit.

35:31.430 --> 35:32.931
- What?

35:32.964 --> 35:35.401
You want to bother the Kings
with this petty shit right now?

35:35.434 --> 35:36.668
Go ahead.

35:39.505 --> 35:41.407
- All good, boy scout?

35:43.775 --> 35:45.477
Yeah.

35:45.511 --> 35:48.146
Thanks.
I fucking needed that.

36:31.957 --> 36:33.825
- Fuck me.

37:01.052 --> 37:03.322
- Thank you.

37:06.892 --> 37:09.328
- Sorry I'm a little late.
- No problem.

37:11.363 --> 37:13.799
- How was the session?

37:13.832 --> 37:16.902
- So illuminating.

37:40.326 --> 37:42.528
- Vatos are here.

37:53.071 --> 37:55.807
- Hey.
- Hey.

37:55.841 --> 37:59.110
- You didn't tell me you guys
got into it with the Mayans.

37:59.144 --> 38:00.746
- "Into it"?

38:09.821 --> 38:12.658
- Tell me, hermano...

38:12.691 --> 38:14.526
are they into it?

38:17.763 --> 38:20.799
I'll tell you what they're into.

38:20.832 --> 38:23.001
Same as you--

38:23.034 --> 38:26.472
making fucking money.

38:26.505 --> 38:29.975
You rode six hours here
to throw shade?

38:30.008 --> 38:33.412
I know they fucked up your crew.

38:33.445 --> 38:34.946
But we'll make that right.

38:37.015 --> 38:39.418
So you either join us

38:39.451 --> 38:41.653
or fuck off back to TJ.

38:42.988 --> 38:45.657
- 'Cause I don't have time
for this shit.

38:47.359 --> 38:49.628
- You got it...

38:59.204 --> 39:02.641
- Santo Padre, with respect...

39:02.674 --> 39:06.277
will schedule with the Irish.

39:06.311 --> 39:10.248
VM unloads and stores,

39:10.281 --> 39:14.352
transports
to East Cali border.

39:14.386 --> 39:17.389
We think 30% for the Vatos
is a fair cut.

39:22.694 --> 39:24.195
- We're good with that.

39:26.532 --> 39:29.635
- And how much will it cost us
for the port official?

39:29.668 --> 39:32.270
- We unload twice a month.

39:32.303 --> 39:34.573
Secure storage.

39:44.182 --> 39:46.718
- Ah.

39:46.752 --> 39:49.087
7K U.S. dollars.

39:51.022 --> 39:53.158
- Sounds about right.

39:53.191 --> 39:54.793
- What's Sam Crow's take?

39:54.826 --> 39:57.763
- We were supposed to get a cut
for the first two years,

39:57.796 --> 39:59.197
but considering it's taken

39:59.230 --> 40:00.632
almost three years
to hand it off--

40:00.666 --> 40:02.668
- We're okay with that--

40:02.701 --> 40:05.003
you getting the 10%.

40:05.036 --> 40:06.605
- That's what Teller wanted.

40:09.340 --> 40:11.276
- That's more than
a fair deal, gentlemen.

40:11.309 --> 40:14.345
- Hey.

40:20.418 --> 40:22.020
- Okay.

40:24.756 --> 40:28.727
- We'll throw half of our 10%
to the Vatos.

40:28.760 --> 40:30.762
5% for restitutions.

40:35.033 --> 40:36.868
- And, uh...

40:39.404 --> 40:43.074
What about the Mayans?

40:43.108 --> 40:44.976
What about their restitution?

40:48.847 --> 40:52.383
- You lost men because you came
into our fucking backyard.

40:52.417 --> 40:53.785
No call, no respect.

40:53.819 --> 40:55.721
What the fuck did you think
was gonna happen?

40:55.754 --> 40:59.791
- We didn't know it was still
your territory, man.

40:59.825 --> 41:02.260
Thought you were too thick
with the cartel to care

41:02.293 --> 41:04.596
if a few patches came and made
a little border scratch.

41:04.630 --> 41:07.566
- You were wrong.

41:07.599 --> 41:09.100
- Fuck you, traidor!

41:09.134 --> 41:10.869
Mayans killed nine of my men.

41:10.902 --> 41:12.370
- Because
you were fucking wrong!

41:12.403 --> 41:15.774
- Can we just agree that maybe
you're both fucking wrong?

41:19.410 --> 41:21.647
Come on, brother.

41:21.680 --> 41:24.249
You need to put something
on this fucking table.

41:43.569 --> 41:45.904
- First year...

41:45.937 --> 41:48.006
we'll match your 5%.

41:48.039 --> 41:49.440
- Fuck that!
20%!

41:49.474 --> 41:51.643
- Fuck you!

41:51.677 --> 41:53.511
- Fuck, man!

41:53.545 --> 41:56.081
Jesus Christ!

41:56.114 --> 41:57.448
Fuck!

41:57.482 --> 41:59.951
You fucking Mexicans.

41:59.985 --> 42:03.421
You make us Scots look sensible.

42:03.454 --> 42:05.423
How about this?

42:05.456 --> 42:09.394
Let's say the Mayans
match our 5% for two years.

42:14.165 --> 42:16.167
Come on, gentlemen.

42:16.201 --> 42:17.836
Get your fucking dicks
off the table.

42:17.869 --> 42:19.370
This is a fair deal.

42:33.685 --> 42:37.288
There we go.
See?

42:37.322 --> 42:39.357
Civilized.

42:40.759 --> 42:44.029
And now we're all
a little bit richer.

42:44.062 --> 42:45.563
Slange Var.

42:45.597 --> 42:47.666
Cheers to you all.

43:01.246 --> 43:03.081
- Any luck
at the storage unit?

43:04.750 --> 43:07.853
Did you find
your father's quote?

43:07.886 --> 43:10.188
- No.

43:10.221 --> 43:12.758
No, I didn't.

43:12.791 --> 43:16.094
Just some old household bills
from ten years ago.

43:16.127 --> 43:17.863
Piqued my curiosity.

43:17.896 --> 43:20.198
- Such a long time ago.

43:23.635 --> 43:26.071
- You told me...

43:26.104 --> 43:28.573
you chose to live
outside the circle

43:28.606 --> 43:29.975
for Miguel.

43:30.008 --> 43:32.911
- I did.

43:32.944 --> 43:36.581
- So even when José was
under the DOJ deal?

43:36.614 --> 43:40.318
He didn't use you
to circumvent their scrutiny?

43:40.351 --> 43:43.388
- What's in
the envelope, Emily?

43:43.421 --> 43:44.956
- Questions.

43:46.825 --> 43:49.928
- Questions
about old accounts.

43:49.961 --> 43:53.598
I'm afraid the answers you want
are all dead and buried.

44:00.471 --> 44:02.607
- I need to go downtown.

44:02.640 --> 44:04.409
I have a few more errands.

44:19.157 --> 44:20.926
- Keep in touch.
- Yeah, man.

44:26.331 --> 44:28.700
- All right, my brother.
- Great meeting.

44:28.734 --> 44:30.836
- Yeah, man.
Went good.

44:30.869 --> 44:32.704
My brother.

44:32.738 --> 44:34.740
- So you sure
you don't want to stay?

44:34.773 --> 44:36.241
- Hell, no.

44:36.274 --> 44:39.477
Man was not intended to survive
in this fucking heat.

44:41.312 --> 44:43.114
- Yeah, he got to head
back north

44:43.148 --> 44:45.150
before he turns into
a puddle of Jameson.

44:45.183 --> 44:48.386
- There's some truth in that.

44:53.224 --> 44:54.692
- We did it.

45:03.601 --> 45:05.871
Jacky-boy'd be proud.

45:07.338 --> 45:10.041
- Yeah.

45:10.075 --> 45:12.177
He would.

45:14.679 --> 45:17.148
- Good luck.
- Be safe.

45:17.182 --> 45:18.850
- See you after.
- Yeah.

45:44.309 --> 45:46.611
- She's got to
pick up eventually.

45:57.823 --> 45:59.590
- Where do you want to go,
ma'am?

46:01.726 --> 46:03.995
- Head into town--
the butcher shop.

46:04.029 --> 46:06.431
I want to see
if it's still open.

46:06.464 --> 46:08.934
- Reyes Carnecería?

46:08.967 --> 46:10.635
- Yes.

46:13.771 --> 46:16.607
- You have reached
the voice mailbox of Em--

46:22.347 --> 46:24.515
- Let's get a drink.

46:51.342 --> 46:53.945
- Looks like they're closed.

46:53.979 --> 46:55.580
- I, uh--

46:55.613 --> 46:57.315
I'm sure they'll open for us.

46:57.348 --> 47:00.318
I promised Miguel
a good steak for dinner.

47:08.927 --> 47:11.062
Ah, Jesus.

47:11.096 --> 47:12.697
Now this one.

47:22.807 --> 47:24.075
- I know you're closed.

47:24.109 --> 47:27.145
I just wanted
to grab a few steaks.

47:27.178 --> 47:29.881
- Of course.

47:36.421 --> 47:39.057
Pretty sure
this isn't about meat.

47:41.960 --> 47:43.461
- No, it's not.

47:47.332 --> 47:49.767
- I'll get you
a couple of steaks here.

47:57.175 --> 48:01.512
- I was in storage today looking
at old accounting ledgers.

48:01.546 --> 48:03.381
I found those.

48:10.055 --> 48:12.057
- Tell me
what I'm looking at here.

48:15.426 --> 48:17.562
- What happened
between you and Dita?

48:17.595 --> 48:18.997
Was it an affair?

48:19.030 --> 48:21.466
Did it piss off José?
Is that why you left?

48:21.499 --> 48:24.035
- Tell me what
I'm looking at here, Emily.

48:27.338 --> 48:29.740
- EZ knows a...

48:29.774 --> 48:34.045
hit man killed Marisol...

48:34.079 --> 48:36.747
and was supposed
to kill you, too.

48:36.781 --> 48:39.117
- A hit man?

48:39.150 --> 48:40.651
EZ told you this?

48:40.685 --> 48:42.387
- Yes.

48:42.420 --> 48:45.991
He also knows that the payments
came from Mexico.

48:46.024 --> 48:49.194
Money transfers.
These checks match the amounts.

48:52.430 --> 48:55.533
They are from the Galindos
personal accounts.

48:55.566 --> 48:57.835
Household bills, groceries,
local vendors...

48:59.870 --> 49:03.341
Dita signed the checks.

49:03.374 --> 49:06.511
I'm so sorry, Felipe.

49:06.544 --> 49:08.779
But I'm afraid
of what this means.

49:08.813 --> 49:11.116
I don't know what happens next.

49:11.149 --> 49:13.418
I--

49:13.451 --> 49:15.720
I didn't know
who else to come to.

49:17.555 --> 49:19.624
- Does anybody else
know about this?

49:19.657 --> 49:21.092
- No.

49:23.428 --> 49:24.795
What do I do?

49:24.829 --> 49:26.497
- Nothing right now.

49:29.267 --> 49:32.603
- I have to protect my family.
- I know.

49:32.637 --> 49:34.905
And I have to protect mine.

49:36.607 --> 49:39.244
Just give me a couple days.

49:39.277 --> 49:42.347
We'll get it together
and make sure everyone's safe.

49:46.051 --> 49:47.452
- Thank you.

50:15.680 --> 50:18.816
What are you doing here?

50:18.849 --> 50:21.018
- I was just about
to ask you the same thing.

50:24.555 --> 50:26.691
- Your steaks.

50:26.724 --> 50:28.259
- Yes.
Thank you.

50:28.293 --> 50:30.461
- It seems as if
all the women in my life

50:30.495 --> 50:34.199
can't stay away from you,
señor Reyes.

50:34.232 --> 50:38.336
- I'm the only butcher in town.

50:38.369 --> 50:42.273
I'm sure you can appreciate
a good monopoly, son.

50:44.409 --> 50:45.843
Have a good night.

50:54.752 --> 50:56.654
- Nestor's keeping
a short leash on me.

50:58.656 --> 51:00.125
- In the car.

52:03.788 --> 52:06.157
- Oh, what the fuck was that?

52:06.191 --> 52:07.392
- Did you see that?
- Hurry up.

52:07.425 --> 52:09.860
- What the fuck, prospect?
- Shit.

52:09.894 --> 52:12.062
- Jesus. What the hell?

52:12.096 --> 52:14.299
- Oh, shit!

52:16.100 --> 52:17.768
- Inside!
On me.

52:17.802 --> 52:19.870
We'll hit them from the side.

52:19.904 --> 52:21.138
- God.
- Ah, shit!

52:21.172 --> 52:22.807
- Fuck!
- Taz, get down!

52:24.975 --> 52:26.177
- Fuck.

52:31.749 --> 52:33.284
- Coco!

52:39.357 --> 52:41.592
- Come on.
Hurry, hurry!

52:41.626 --> 52:44.495
Get him, get him, get him!

52:44.529 --> 52:45.630
Vámonos!

52:45.663 --> 52:48.899
- Go, go, go, go!

52:48.933 --> 52:50.134
- Fuck!

52:50.167 --> 52:52.337
- Let's go, let's go!
- Let's go, let's go.

52:54.572 --> 52:55.840
- Shit. Riz.

53:03.881 --> 53:06.651
- Fuck!

53:08.853 --> 53:11.322
- Hey, hey, you good?
- He's barely got a pulse.

53:11.356 --> 53:12.823
- Riz.
- Riz, come on.

53:12.857 --> 53:13.858
- Riz! Riz!

53:13.891 --> 53:15.860
- Call a fucking ambulance!

53:15.893 --> 53:18.162
- Now! Fuck!

53:18.195 --> 53:20.030
- You all right, man?

53:20.064 --> 53:21.999
You all right?

53:22.032 --> 53:25.069
I can't fucking see.

54:20.458 --> 54:23.394
(hard rock music plays)

54:27.632 --> 54:29.567
(male vocalist growls)

54:29.600 --> 54:32.403
(singing in Spanish)

54:42.046 --> 54:44.048
-La sangre...
-Es la sangre.

54:46.817 --> 54:50.321
ANNOUNCER: Mayans.
All new Tuesdays at 10:00 on FX.

54:51.489 --> 54:53.257
(chattering)

54:53.290 --> 54:55.593
(breathing heavily)

55:01.265 --> 55:02.667
(screaming)

55:02.767 --> 55:04.502
ANNOUNCER: AHS 1984.

55:04.602 --> 55:06.337
Wednesdays at 10:00 on FX.

55:07.938 --> 55:09.840
WOMAN: I want to thank you
for joining the focus group.

55:09.874 --> 55:12.843
-(crashing)
-I just want to say thanks
to the suits back there

55:12.943 --> 55:15.212
for allowing us to be here.

55:15.312 --> 55:17.281
He thinks that's
a two-way mirror.

55:17.314 --> 55:18.783
ANNOUNCER: All-new Sunny.

55:18.816 --> 55:21.352
Wednesdays at 10:00 on FXX.

55:23.854 --> 55:27.324
(deep voices chanting)
I... know... more.

55:27.358 --> 55:30.127
I think I'd make
a great drag queen.
Like, for real.

55:30.160 --> 55:33.831
But the one time I tried it,
I looked so much like my mom,
it scared me.

55:33.864 --> 55:35.500
And I was sexy as hell.

55:35.533 --> 55:38.202
(deep voices chanting)

55:39.537 --> 55:41.171
I'm Brittany's dad.

55:41.205 --> 55:43.674
I work
in the security industry.

55:43.708 --> 55:45.643
Have you ever
killed anybody?

55:45.676 --> 55:47.512
Uh, once.

55:49.213 --> 55:50.981
I'm just kiddin', mate.
I'm just kiddin'.
