00:01.667 --> 00:04.458
[instrumental music]

00:07.625 --> 00:09.958
- Good morning, captain.
- Oh, good morning, ambassador.

00:10.042 --> 00:11.750
Do you mind if I walk with you
for a moment?

00:11.833 --> 00:13.250
No, no, not at all.

00:13.333 --> 00:16.208
Is there, uh, something
I can do for you?

00:16.292 --> 00:18.000
I spoke with John last night.

00:18.083 --> 00:21.417
He told me why he chose you
for this position.

00:21.500 --> 00:22.833
Well, he wanted someone
from Earthforce

00:22.917 --> 00:24.083
to show the folks back home..

00:24.167 --> 00:26.875
No. In addition to that.

00:28.833 --> 00:30.417
I'm sorry.

00:30.500 --> 00:32.083
I wish he hadn't told you

00:32.167 --> 00:34.208
without giving me
some advance warning.

00:34.292 --> 00:37.250
No, it's alright.
I forced the issue.

00:37.333 --> 00:40.542
I just wanted you to know
that I understand his reasons.

00:40.625 --> 00:42.792
You were the correct,
logical choice

00:42.875 --> 00:44.917
and I support his decision.

00:45.000 --> 00:47.792
I appreciate that, ambassador.

00:47.875 --> 00:50.583
But since others might not
be quite so understanding

00:50.667 --> 00:54.458
I would, uh, really prefer
to keep this between the two..

00:56.000 --> 00:57.417
The three of us.

00:57.500 --> 00:59.083
[beeping]

01:00.708 --> 01:04.375
I, uh, don't think anyone
else really needs to know.

01:09.750 --> 01:12.833
[instrumental music]

01:20.500 --> 01:23.458
Londo, there you are.

01:23.542 --> 01:25.333
I was gonna tell you
your ship just arrived

01:25.417 --> 01:28.250
but I guess you can see
that for yourself.

01:28.333 --> 01:31.292
Would you like me to tell you
what I see, Mr. Allan?

01:31.958 --> 01:34.542
I see..

01:34.625 --> 01:36.500
What is that
quaint human phrase?

01:36.583 --> 01:38.458
"The end of the line?"

01:38.542 --> 01:39.500
Yeah.

01:39.583 --> 01:42.083
The Regent is not well.

01:42.167 --> 01:43.417
For the next few months

01:43.500 --> 01:46.333
I will be at his side
as much as time allows.

01:46.417 --> 01:48.833
I will go there
and come back here..

01:48.917 --> 01:50.792
...but when he leaves us

01:50.875 --> 01:54.667
the Centaurum will turn to me
to fill that void.

01:54.750 --> 02:00.125
When that day comes, Mr. Allan,
I shall not return.

02:00.208 --> 02:03.167
Barring the occasional
state visit

02:03.250 --> 02:06.625
I shall never lay eyes
on Babylon 5 again.

02:06.708 --> 02:08.792
I didn't think
you'd mind that part.

02:08.875 --> 02:10.875
Neither did I.

02:10.958 --> 02:12.042
Strange that.

02:12.125 --> 02:14.042
Yeah, but you'll be the emperor.

02:14.125 --> 02:15.708
That's gotta be
a great feeling

02:15.792 --> 02:17.875
Emperor Mollari, the first.

02:17.958 --> 02:19.292
The second.

02:19.375 --> 02:21.542
There was one before you?

02:21.625 --> 02:23.292
Yes, long ago.

02:24.125 --> 02:28.500
He too...ended badly.

02:28.583 --> 02:30.833
Now, come on, you've got
your whole life ahead of you.

02:30.917 --> 02:32.958
Why would you say
a thing like that?

02:33.042 --> 02:34.792
Because I know.

02:34.875 --> 02:38.750
My people always know.

02:38.833 --> 02:41.792
I don't know why
or how or where

02:41.875 --> 02:47.917
but I can feel it to the very
core of my being, Mr. Allan.

02:48.000 --> 02:53.875
This is where it begins
to go badly for all of us.

02:53.958 --> 02:57.000
(Corwin)
'Babylon Control
to transport 1-1-7-1-9.'

02:57.083 --> 02:58.542
You've turned off autopilot.

02:58.625 --> 03:02.208
Please return control
to B5 C and C at once.

03:02.292 --> 03:03.708
(male #1 on radio)
'We're having
navigation problems.'

03:03.792 --> 03:04.958
'Backing up for another try.'

03:05.042 --> 03:07.250
Negative.
Do not activate thrusters.

03:07.333 --> 03:09.167
We cannot get
the pressure doors open in time.

03:09.250 --> 03:10.583
(male #1 on radio)
'Systems failure!'

03:10.667 --> 03:12.333
'We've gotta pull back
or we'll hit the walls!'

03:12.417 --> 03:15.792
Negative! I say again,
do not fire thrusters.

03:20.167 --> 03:21.958
(Kosh)
And so it begins..

03:22.042 --> 03:24.833
- There is a hole in your mind.
What do you want?

03:24.917 --> 03:28.292
(G'Kar)
No one here is exactly
what he appears.

03:28.375 --> 03:30.625
(Hague)
Commander Sinclair
is being reassigned.

03:30.708 --> 03:32.833
(Londo)
Why don't you eliminate
the entire Narn Homeworld..

03:32.917 --> 03:36.750
(Elric)
I see a great hand
reaching out of the star.

03:36.833 --> 03:39.458
(female #1)
President Clark has signed
a decree today declaring..

03:39.542 --> 03:42.125
(Sheridan)
These orders have forced us
to declare independence..

03:42.208 --> 03:44.042
Unless your people get off
their encounter-suited butts

03:44.125 --> 03:45.250
and do something.

03:45.333 --> 03:46.792
(Zathras)
You're the one who was.

03:46.875 --> 03:49.417
(Kosh)
If you go to Z'ha'dum,
you will die.

03:49.500 --> 03:50.917
(Lorien)
Why are you here?

03:51.000 --> 03:52.833
Do you have anything
worth living for?

03:52.917 --> 03:54.500
(Delenn)
I think of my beautiful
city in flames.

03:54.583 --> 03:56.000
(Sheridan)
Giants in the playground.

03:56.083 --> 03:57.750
Now, get the hell
out of our galaxy!

03:57.833 --> 04:00.375
We are here to place
President Clark under arrest.

04:00.458 --> 04:03.500
[theme music]

04:33.708 --> 04:36.750
[music continues]

'Earth transport Marks
to Babylon Control.'

04:52.542 --> 04:54.958
'Any idea how much longer we're
gonna have to wait out here?'

04:55.042 --> 04:58.583
Unknown. The captain's out
inspecting the damage now.

05:00.792 --> 05:02.458
(Lochley)
'What a mess.'

05:04.292 --> 05:05.542
Lochley to repair team.

05:05.625 --> 05:07.583
How long until
you can fix this thing?

05:07.667 --> 05:10.625
(male #2 on radio)
'We've got debris all through
the main elevator shafts.'

05:10.708 --> 05:12.250
'Totally gummed up the works.'

05:12.333 --> 05:14.542
'Figure 12, 13 hours.'

05:14.625 --> 05:17.875
Come on, you guys are on
time and a half as it is.

05:18.625 --> 05:20.125
Killin' me here.

05:21.292 --> 05:22.833
I'll tell you what.

05:22.917 --> 05:26.583
Get it done in 11 hours and
I'll pretend that I didn't see

05:26.667 --> 05:29.875
that extremely non-regulation
picture hanging in your locker.

05:29.958 --> 05:32.375
You know, the one from your
bachelor party. You know, the--

05:32.458 --> 05:34.083
(male #2 on radio)
'You've got a deal.'

05:35.292 --> 05:37.167
Thanks.

05:37.250 --> 05:39.625
Alright, C and C,
I'm heading in.

05:39.708 --> 05:42.417
I'll come around back. Are
the emergency air doors clear?

05:42.500 --> 05:45.208
(male #2 on radio)
'We've got some other official
transports coming in the back'

05:45.292 --> 05:47.667
'but we'll keep them out
until you're in.'

05:54.458 --> 05:56.125
Oh, this is..

06:01.375 --> 06:03.792
Finding everything you need?

06:08.000 --> 06:10.292
Oh, let me guess now.

06:10.375 --> 06:15.000
This must be for the telepaths
living in Downbelow, right?

06:15.083 --> 06:16.833
They don't have anything,
Stephen.

06:16.917 --> 06:20.333
They're, they're short on
clothes, food, medical supplies.

06:20.417 --> 06:22.208
Well, tell them to come on
up here.

06:22.292 --> 06:24.042
You know, I wondered
where this got off to.

06:24.125 --> 06:25.875
Some of them have
been through some pretty tough

06:25.958 --> 06:28.167
Psi Corps medical
experiments, so..

06:28.250 --> 06:29.792
...they don't trust doctors.

06:29.875 --> 06:32.583
Besides, they prefer
to be self-sufficient.

06:32.667 --> 06:34.792
Well, I wouldn't call
asking you to steal stuff

06:34.875 --> 06:36.125
for them self-sufficient.

06:36.208 --> 06:37.958
I am not stealing.

06:38.042 --> 06:40.833
This stuff was all earmarked
for the lurkers in Downbelow.

06:40.917 --> 06:42.292
Charity cases.

06:42.375 --> 06:44.458
You weren't getting
paid for it anyway.

06:44.542 --> 06:47.000
Besides, they didn't
ask me to do anything.

06:47.083 --> 06:49.083
I came here on my own.

06:49.167 --> 06:51.958
You really believe in what
they're doing, don't you?

06:52.042 --> 06:53.958
They're not here
to cause trouble, Stephen.

06:54.042 --> 06:55.917
They're just trying
to find a place to call home.

06:56.000 --> 06:58.833
Not just for themselves,
but for all telepaths.

06:58.917 --> 07:00.292
Nobody else wants us.

07:00.375 --> 07:02.292
We may as well try
and make a place for ourselves.

07:03.125 --> 07:05.833
So, yeah, I believe in them.

07:07.125 --> 07:09.708
Byron has a dream
for all telepaths.

07:09.792 --> 07:12.333
I wanna help make it come true.

07:12.417 --> 07:13.542
[beeping]

07:13.625 --> 07:15.250
Franklin, go.

07:15.333 --> 07:17.500
(Delenn)
'Doctor, I'd like to come
talk to you in an hour'

07:17.583 --> 07:18.667
'if you have time.'

07:18.750 --> 07:20.875
Yeah, no problem.
I'll see you then.

07:20.958 --> 07:22.833
So, uh, you need a hand
with that?

07:22.917 --> 07:24.542
No, I got it. Thanks.

07:24.625 --> 07:28.292
Alright. Well, next time
you need something, just ask.

07:41.542 --> 07:44.375
I found some more supplies.
I thought they might help.

07:44.458 --> 07:46.500
You've no idea.

07:50.125 --> 07:53.167
[indistinct chatter]

07:57.542 --> 08:00.458
And these are for you.

08:00.542 --> 08:01.875
What are they?

08:01.958 --> 08:03.042
Vitamins.

08:03.125 --> 08:04.375
They should go
to the children.

08:04.458 --> 08:05.875
They're too strong for children.

08:05.958 --> 08:07.375
Then they should
go to the sick.

08:07.458 --> 08:09.042
Which is what
you're going to be

08:09.125 --> 08:12.542
if you don't slow down and
start taking care of yourself.

08:12.625 --> 08:15.083
When was the last time
that you slept?

08:15.167 --> 08:16.708
Really slept.

08:17.917 --> 08:19.208
It was three

08:19.292 --> 08:22.500
no, four lifetimes ago.

08:24.167 --> 08:25.833
I was a coppersmith.

08:27.125 --> 08:29.375
And at the end of a long day

08:29.458 --> 08:32.875
I'd lay out under
the stars, beside the river

08:32.958 --> 08:37.125
and my dearest love
cradled my head in her lap.

08:37.208 --> 08:41.375
She ran her fingers
against my temples and forehead.

08:41.458 --> 08:43.875
Soft and cool and delicate.

08:45.167 --> 08:46.458
And I slept.

08:47.917 --> 08:52.042
I slept as I have never
slept before or since.

08:52.125 --> 08:53.250
I slept full measure enough

08:53.333 --> 08:56.208
to sustain me
through five eternities.

08:58.208 --> 09:00.458
When I awoke,
she was gone.

09:00.542 --> 09:02.000
And there was
a tall tree standing

09:02.083 --> 09:04.792
where she had been
the night before.

09:04.875 --> 09:07.000
A willow.

09:07.083 --> 09:12.125
Its delicate branches
touching my face like tears.

09:12.208 --> 09:17.583
It remained there by the river
long after I had gone to dust.

09:17.667 --> 09:20.500
If there was a straight answer
buried in there somewhere

09:20.583 --> 09:22.083
I sure as hell didn't see it.

09:22.167 --> 09:23.417
It was a parable.

09:23.500 --> 09:24.500
Oh!

09:24.583 --> 09:26.792
The willow
is deceptively strong.

09:26.875 --> 09:29.458
It bends,
but it does not break.

09:29.542 --> 09:33.542
Its roots are deep and can
withstand the worst storm.

09:33.625 --> 09:37.333
It promises rest
and shade and cool breezes

09:37.417 --> 09:40.458
to those who would
find rest beneath it.

09:44.875 --> 09:48.833
You have become my willow.

09:48.917 --> 09:51.708
And we have all found
shelter in your kindness.

09:52.750 --> 09:55.083
Thank you.

09:55.167 --> 09:58.333
That was probably
the most elegant attempt

09:58.417 --> 10:01.750
to change the topic
I have ever heard.

10:02.792 --> 10:04.417
Sleep, Byron?

10:04.500 --> 10:06.333
Sleep isn't the issue.

10:06.417 --> 10:07.625
We sleep too much.

10:07.708 --> 10:10.208
It's the dreaming
we don't do enough of.

10:10.292 --> 10:13.333
[dramatic music]

10:28.458 --> 10:30.375
- What is it?
- Can't you feel it?

10:30.458 --> 10:31.875
Open your thoughts.

10:31.958 --> 10:34.500
Take down the walls the mundanes
forced us to live inside.

10:34.583 --> 10:36.792
Open your senses and feel.

10:44.000 --> 10:46.500
[footsteps trotting]

10:49.625 --> 10:51.000
Bloodhound units.

10:51.917 --> 10:53.333
Yes.

10:54.000 --> 10:55.625
He's here.

10:56.667 --> 10:59.750
[music continues]

11:09.750 --> 11:12.125
[theme music]

11:22.667 --> 11:24.042
- Chief around?
- Uh, no.

11:24.125 --> 11:26.250
He had to hit the head.
What's up?

11:26.333 --> 11:29.042
I don't think
I'm supposed to tell you.

11:29.125 --> 11:30.542
Tell me what?

11:30.625 --> 11:33.417
Come on, this is me.

11:33.500 --> 11:35.833
Bester just came onboard.

11:35.917 --> 11:38.333
'Said he's here
to see the captain. I..'

11:42.458 --> 11:43.542
[man grunts]

11:44.958 --> 11:48.458
And the bartender says to
Rene Descartes, "Another beer?"

11:48.542 --> 11:51.875
And Descartes says,
"I think not," and disappears.

11:51.958 --> 11:54.500
[both laughing]

11:54.583 --> 11:55.625
Bester.

12:02.000 --> 12:04.042
[screaming]

12:06.000 --> 12:07.792
- You son of a--
- What the hell do you think--

12:07.875 --> 12:10.917
- Get out of my way!
- Back off, mister!

12:11.000 --> 12:12.500
I said back off!

12:12.583 --> 12:14.917
You don't understand! He..

12:15.000 --> 12:16.083
[groans]

12:16.167 --> 12:17.750
Security!

12:17.833 --> 12:19.292
Escort Mr. Garibaldi
here to the brig

12:19.375 --> 12:21.833
and do not cut him
loose until I say so.

12:26.042 --> 12:27.458
Just for the record, gentlemen

12:27.542 --> 12:29.958
you are now exactly five seconds
away from a court martial

12:30.042 --> 12:32.167
so make the best of them.

12:39.833 --> 12:43.042
[sighs]
My apologies for
the interruption, Mr. Bester.

12:43.125 --> 12:47.208
Not at all, captain.
I'm used to it.

12:47.292 --> 12:50.833
Now, where were we?

12:50.917 --> 12:54.125
You want me to quit Medlab?

12:55.458 --> 12:56.917
Not quit.

12:57.000 --> 12:59.833
Just delegate some of your
responsibilities to your staff

12:59.917 --> 13:02.292
to make room
for other things.

13:02.375 --> 13:04.125
What kind of other things?

13:04.208 --> 13:05.917
With the creation
of this new Alliance

13:06.000 --> 13:07.542
there will be even
more interaction

13:07.625 --> 13:09.667
between races
from different worlds

13:09.750 --> 13:14.000
and some diseases can cross
from one species to another.

13:14.083 --> 13:16.292
Yeah, I know.
It worries me.

13:16.375 --> 13:19.125
Literature on cross-species
infection is still growing.

13:19.208 --> 13:20.333
There hasn't been
much opportunity

13:20.417 --> 13:22.208
for real research in that area.

13:22.292 --> 13:23.708
Well, now there is.

13:23.792 --> 13:25.667
As advisory council
for the new Alliance

13:25.750 --> 13:26.917
we want you to put together

13:27.000 --> 13:29.375
the definitive work
in this area.

13:29.458 --> 13:31.958
(Delenn)
'Your work here on Babylon 5
was a good start.'

13:32.042 --> 13:35.333
You've had access to the medical
conditions of dozens of races.

13:35.417 --> 13:36.625
Now we want to send you out

13:36.708 --> 13:39.667
to member worlds
to do first-hand research.

13:39.750 --> 13:41.083
Where that is impractical

13:41.167 --> 13:44.042
we will put you in contact
with their ambassadors here.

13:44.125 --> 13:45.458
It is a condition of membership

13:45.542 --> 13:48.500
that medical information
be made available to you.

13:48.583 --> 13:50.458
Obviously there
are certain dangers.

13:50.542 --> 13:52.083
Many of the other
races want to keep

13:52.167 --> 13:54.042
their medical
histories confidential

13:54.125 --> 13:56.583
but we'd love to have you
take on the job

13:56.667 --> 13:59.250
if you're willing.

13:59.333 --> 14:02.083
Hell, yeah.
Where do I sign up?

14:05.750 --> 14:09.458
He will be a fine addition
to our team, very fine.

14:09.542 --> 14:10.792
I agree.

14:12.333 --> 14:14.125
So why are you troubled?

14:14.208 --> 14:18.583
I do not feel as if I am doing
enough for the Alliance, Delenn.

14:18.667 --> 14:20.333
Be careful, G'Kar.

14:20.417 --> 14:23.583
When the universe hears
you say something like that

14:23.667 --> 14:27.125
it tends to answer
in the most surprising ways.

14:28.625 --> 14:32.042
Captain, good,
I was just about to call you.

14:32.125 --> 14:34.750
I understand you got into a bit
of a dust-up with Mr. Garibaldi.

14:34.833 --> 14:36.458
That's correct, Mr. President.

14:36.542 --> 14:39.292
He burst in on a meeting and
attempted to assault my guest.

14:39.375 --> 14:44.125
guest
got inside Mr. Garibaldi's head

14:44.208 --> 14:46.292
reprogrammed him,
messed up his life.

14:46.375 --> 14:48.375
Hell, he almost
got both of us killed.

14:48.458 --> 14:49.792
I'm aware of that, sir.

14:49.875 --> 14:51.125
The reports do a very good job

14:51.208 --> 14:53.417
of putting across
his side, and yours.

14:53.500 --> 14:55.042
Now, would you
like to hear my side

14:55.125 --> 14:56.292
or would you rather
continue shouting?

14:56.375 --> 14:57.500
If the latter,
please let me know

14:57.583 --> 14:59.708
so I can sit down
and get comfortable.

15:01.417 --> 15:02.750
[clears throat]

15:02.833 --> 15:04.625
Go on.

15:04.708 --> 15:07.333
Despite my objections,
you gave the telepaths

15:07.417 --> 15:09.208
permission to form
a colony here.

15:09.292 --> 15:12.000
You did not, however, grant
them immunity from prosecution.

15:12.083 --> 15:14.583
They're wanted on a variety
of charges by the Psi Corps.

15:14.667 --> 15:17.917
- Also known as fascists are us.
- Granted.

15:18.042 --> 15:20.000
Nonetheless, they are
a part of the government

15:20.083 --> 15:22.750
and I am still accountable
to that government.

15:22.833 --> 15:25.875
Bester is here on direct
orders from EarthGov.

15:25.958 --> 15:28.000
Now, you and Delenn
said very specifically

15:28.083 --> 15:31.208
that the Interstellar Alliance
grants sovereignty to each world

15:31.292 --> 15:33.542
'to govern its people
the way it sees fit.'

15:33.625 --> 15:35.333
And since EarthGov
is part of the Alliance

15:35.417 --> 15:37.458
you have to respect
their internal policies.

15:37.542 --> 15:38.833
How am I doing so far?

15:38.917 --> 15:41.500
- Annoyingly logical.
- Thank you.

15:41.583 --> 15:43.083
It wasn't a compliment.

15:43.167 --> 15:45.417
I can't ignore him
or throw him out

15:45.500 --> 15:47.250
until he breaks the rules.

15:47.333 --> 15:50.000
Whatever past relationship
you and Garibaldi have with him

15:50.083 --> 15:53.375
I have to behave according
to what he does on my watch.

15:54.500 --> 15:55.667
If I judged everyone

15:55.750 --> 15:58.250
according to what was
reported to me by others

15:58.333 --> 16:00.792
I would have concluded that
you were a traitor to Earth

16:00.875 --> 16:04.792
during the war
and shot you on sight, sir.

16:08.042 --> 16:09.250
Look, I give you my word

16:09.333 --> 16:10.792
if he breaks the rules
so much as an inch

16:10.875 --> 16:12.083
he's out of here,
but until then

16:12.167 --> 16:14.792
I have got to
do this my way.

16:16.458 --> 16:17.792
[sighs]

16:22.958 --> 16:24.833
I suppose you're right.

16:27.583 --> 16:31.333
Yeah, if I contravene our
policies for my own convenience

16:31.417 --> 16:33.250
it'll give our enemies
something to point to

16:33.333 --> 16:34.917
and say we're hypocrites.

16:35.000 --> 16:36.875
If I violate
my promise to the telepaths

16:36.958 --> 16:39.917
our enemies will latch
on to that just as well.

16:40.000 --> 16:44.417
I'm caught in a web
of my own good intentions.

16:44.500 --> 16:47.083
Well, the road to hell
is paved with them, sir.

16:47.167 --> 16:50.875
I know, but why does it have
to go through this office?

16:53.667 --> 16:57.000
He can't have them, captain.
I won't allow it.

16:58.667 --> 17:00.667
Well, at least give me
a reason to say no

17:00.750 --> 17:02.208
other than "I don't want to"

17:02.292 --> 17:04.292
and I'll stick him on
the next transport out of town.

17:04.375 --> 17:05.667
I gave them my word.

17:05.750 --> 17:07.208
Well, that may not be enough.

17:07.292 --> 17:09.375
Find a way to make it enough.

17:11.667 --> 17:14.875
You're not going to make
this easy on me, are you, sir?

17:16.250 --> 17:17.833
It's not my job.

17:27.542 --> 17:29.958
(male #3 on radio)
'Centauri liner
to Babylon control.'

17:30.042 --> 17:32.625
'We can't wait around any longer
for you to finish your repairs.'

17:32.708 --> 17:34.833
- 'We have a schedule to keep.'
- Understood.

17:34.917 --> 17:36.792
Ambassador Mollari
will just have to catch

17:36.875 --> 17:38.917
the next liner
to Centauri Prime.

17:39.000 --> 17:41.417
Turning orbital control
back to your system.

17:41.500 --> 17:43.333
(male #3 on radio)
'Confirmed, setting
navigational controls'

17:43.417 --> 17:47.750
'to locate Centauri Prime
main beacon, 44369.'

17:53.042 --> 17:54.125
[explosion]

17:56.875 --> 17:58.917
(Lochley)
'Any idea yet
what happened to that cruiser?'

17:59.000 --> 18:01.333
We found a trace
of a chemical explosive material

18:01.417 --> 18:02.958
and a detonator.

18:03.042 --> 18:04.667
It's hard to be sure,
but it looked like the bomb

18:04.750 --> 18:06.875
was hooked into the ship's
navigational system.

18:06.958 --> 18:08.750
My guess is
it was programmed to explode

18:08.833 --> 18:11.500
when the nav system was set
for a particular destination.

18:11.583 --> 18:14.083
Oh, well, they just
programmed a series of jumps

18:14.167 --> 18:16.083
that would take them
to the Centauri transit beacon

18:16.167 --> 18:18.083
when the explosion hit.

18:18.167 --> 18:19.583
Somebody didn't want
that liner going home.

18:19.667 --> 18:20.792
Yeah, well,
whoever it was

18:20.875 --> 18:22.375
they weren't
from around here.

18:22.458 --> 18:24.167
The chemical composition
of that explosive

18:24.250 --> 18:25.417
was definitely Centauri

18:25.500 --> 18:27.500
so it was definitely
planted there.

18:27.583 --> 18:29.292
Well, we were
the liner's last stop

18:29.375 --> 18:31.792
so if the bomb
was programmed to go off

18:31.875 --> 18:34.167
when the beacon was set
for the return voyage

18:34.250 --> 18:37.667
then the target has to be
someone getting onboard here.

18:37.750 --> 18:39.167
Any VIPs leaving?

18:39.250 --> 18:40.250
Just Londo.

18:40.333 --> 18:42.667
Oh, that's what
I was afraid of.

18:42.750 --> 18:45.167
Alright, I will go
talk to the ambassador

18:45.250 --> 18:47.125
see if he can narrow down
the list of suspects

18:47.208 --> 18:49.208
to just, oh,
a few thousand of the enemies

18:49.292 --> 18:50.792
he's made over the years.

18:50.875 --> 18:53.000
Oh, and I'll need copies
of all your computer reports.

18:53.083 --> 18:54.292
I'll back-check the analysis

18:54.375 --> 18:55.542
make sure we haven't
missed anything.

18:55.625 --> 18:57.458
- Yeah, take these. Thanks.
- Oh.

18:57.542 --> 19:00.083
Uh, by the way, captain,
just curious, uh..

19:00.167 --> 19:04.167
How long did you plan to leave
Garibaldi in the brig?

19:04.250 --> 19:06.875
I haven't decided yet. Why?

19:06.958 --> 19:10.417
Well, I can understand
why he went fusion like that.

19:10.500 --> 19:11.875
That's not the point.

19:11.958 --> 19:13.792
This is a matter
of discipline and protocol.

19:13.875 --> 19:15.750
You just don't walk
into somebody's office

19:15.833 --> 19:19.125
and start a fight
unless invited to do so.

19:19.208 --> 19:20.542
[chuckles]

19:20.625 --> 19:21.708
You know, this is
the most amazing base

19:21.792 --> 19:23.375
I've ever been posted to.

19:23.458 --> 19:25.333
Everybody here's either
trying to kill each other

19:25.417 --> 19:27.625
or pound
each other into a pulp.

19:27.708 --> 19:30.417
I, I don't know what kind
of way that is to run..

19:30.500 --> 19:31.917
Something wrong?

19:32.000 --> 19:36.083
Well, this status report,
it says the system was used

19:36.167 --> 19:38.917
to pull someone's
classified personnel file.

19:39.000 --> 19:41.083
Whose?

19:41.167 --> 19:45.625
Mine. Security access
code number 0-1-7-1-3-5-9.

19:45.708 --> 19:48.667
- Garibaldi?
- Yeah.

19:48.750 --> 19:51.250
'Where are you going?'

19:51.333 --> 19:53.958
To pound someone,
Mr. Allan, you win.

19:54.042 --> 19:57.292
I just decided if you can't
join them, beat them.

20:07.875 --> 20:10.333
They're not here.

20:10.417 --> 20:14.292
Yes, I'd heard you've
been spending time with them.

20:14.375 --> 20:19.125
Compassion is a lovely thing,
taken in moderation.

20:20.708 --> 20:23.833
Tell me you haven't
gone over to their side.

20:23.917 --> 20:27.208
I thought telepaths
were all on the same side.

20:28.208 --> 20:31.292
Oh, don't play games, Lyta.

20:31.375 --> 20:34.417
Whether you know it or not,
these people are dangerous.

20:34.500 --> 20:36.625
They're on nobody's side
but their own.

20:36.708 --> 20:38.167
Tell me where they are.

20:38.250 --> 20:40.292
No. You have the bloodhounds.

20:40.375 --> 20:42.208
Go find them yourself.

20:42.958 --> 20:44.208
Anything?

20:48.875 --> 20:53.125
Wait, wait, nothing.
Nothing at all.

20:54.083 --> 20:55.917
This is a crowded area.

20:56.000 --> 20:57.208
Even if the blips weren't here

20:57.292 --> 21:00.792
you'd still be
picking up something.

21:00.875 --> 21:06.500
Unless...you were being jammed.

21:06.583 --> 21:10.167
For a moment,
I forgot how strong you are.

21:10.250 --> 21:12.417
I won't make
that mistake again.

21:12.500 --> 21:15.833
I suggest you leave, now.

21:15.917 --> 21:17.708
Check the hall.

21:19.458 --> 21:20.708
[groans]

21:20.792 --> 21:23.042
I said get out!

21:23.125 --> 21:25.583
I am a duly authorized
officer of the law.

21:25.667 --> 21:27.250
Stand aside or..

21:28.458 --> 21:30.292
Or what?

21:30.375 --> 21:32.417
Not bad.

21:33.875 --> 21:36.042
Tell me, is that
really telekinesis

21:36.125 --> 21:37.500
or are you just pushing
the nerve endings

21:37.583 --> 21:40.750
making them feel
as if they've been slapped?

21:40.833 --> 21:44.542
Either way, it's taken
a lot out of you, Lyta.

21:44.625 --> 21:48.208
You're sweating, flushed.

21:48.292 --> 21:51.125
How many times
can you do that, Lyta?

21:51.208 --> 21:54.208
Can you do just one at a time?

21:54.292 --> 21:57.583
'Maybe two?
How about three?'

21:58.958 --> 22:01.375
How about a half dozen of us?

22:03.042 --> 22:05.042
I don't know.

22:05.125 --> 22:07.750
Like you said,
I'm new at this.

22:07.833 --> 22:09.542
I could even make a mistake.

22:09.625 --> 22:13.083
Maybe even pop a blood vessel
in someone's head by accident

22:13.167 --> 22:15.750
by pushing too hard.

22:15.833 --> 22:18.958
Feel like playing the odds,
Mr. Bester?

22:21.167 --> 22:23.667
Unnecessary, Ms. Alexander.

22:26.167 --> 22:27.958
Things have changed.

22:28.042 --> 22:29.875
This time, I have allies

22:29.958 --> 22:32.833
in the chain of command
around here.

22:32.917 --> 22:35.750
'We'll be back with
several dozen security guards.'

22:35.833 --> 22:39.500
I doubt you'll be
very effective against so many.

22:39.583 --> 22:42.250
If your friends are still here,
they'll be arrested.

22:42.333 --> 22:45.083
If they scatter,
it'll make our job easier

22:45.167 --> 22:48.417
since you can't
shield them that way.

22:48.500 --> 22:52.542
Either way,
we're taking them back with us.

22:55.375 --> 22:57.500
I'll be seeing you, Lyta.

23:04.708 --> 23:06.542
I saw what you did.
How did you..

23:06.625 --> 23:08.625
I can't talk
about it now, Byron.

23:08.708 --> 23:11.958
Um, tell your people
get going fast!

23:12.042 --> 23:13.667
Spread out all over the station.

23:13.750 --> 23:15.542
It's their only chance.

23:15.625 --> 23:17.458
I know some places
that might work.

23:17.542 --> 23:19.458
For a while, anyway.

23:19.542 --> 23:21.208
Thank you.

23:23.417 --> 23:25.000
What was that for?

23:25.083 --> 23:26.417
For believing.

23:26.500 --> 23:28.667
Now come on,
we have to go.

23:35.292 --> 23:36.833
Alright, Mr. Garibaldi

23:36.917 --> 23:38.792
either we thrash this out
once and for all

23:38.875 --> 23:40.000
or one of us is gonna go

23:40.083 --> 23:42.208
and I can assure you
it won't be me.

23:42.292 --> 23:43.417
As far as I'm concerned,
you can do your job

23:43.500 --> 23:44.958
just as well on Mars.

23:45.042 --> 23:47.833
Now, you have been riding me
since the day I got here.

23:47.917 --> 23:49.708
What the hell is your problem?

23:49.792 --> 23:53.583
For starters, I don't know you,
therefore I don't trust you.

23:53.667 --> 23:55.542
The world's full
of people you don't know.

23:55.625 --> 23:57.792
I worry about that all the time.

23:57.875 --> 24:00.833
Tough. Get over it.
What else?

24:04.250 --> 24:07.583
Why were you
so chummy with Bester?

24:07.667 --> 24:09.333
I was stationed
at an Earthforce base

24:09.417 --> 24:12.333
near a mining company
several years ago.

24:12.417 --> 24:14.625
A rogue telepath
was messing with my people.

24:14.708 --> 24:17.125
First, cheating them
in the casino

24:17.208 --> 24:18.375
and later,
he killed two of them

24:18.458 --> 24:21.083
because they found out
what he was.

24:21.167 --> 24:23.375
We couldn't find him.
Bester did.

24:23.458 --> 24:25.458
And he saved the lives
of two of my crew.

24:25.542 --> 24:26.917
Now, I don't actually like him

24:27.000 --> 24:28.750
and I sure as hell
don't trust him

24:28.833 --> 24:31.333
but so far he has not done
anything unpleasant to me.

24:31.417 --> 24:32.750
I'm sure he will,
because this place

24:32.833 --> 24:34.417
seems to bring
that out in everyone

24:34.500 --> 24:38.375
but until then, I have
an obligation to be courteous.

24:38.458 --> 24:40.208
And I have
an obligation to shove

24:40.292 --> 24:42.042
his face through a bulkhead.

24:42.125 --> 24:44.208
Your hobbies are your concern,
Mr. Garibaldi.

24:44.292 --> 24:47.458
Just do it where I can't see it,
and do it quietly.

24:48.917 --> 24:50.750
Thanks.

24:50.833 --> 24:54.458
Now, now for the big one.

24:58.333 --> 25:01.917
Why did Sheridan
pick you to run this place?

25:02.042 --> 25:05.417
There's something between you.
What is it?

25:05.500 --> 25:08.833
Is that why you went ransacking
through my personnel file?

25:08.917 --> 25:11.833
Looking for something that
I'm holding over the president?

25:11.917 --> 25:15.875
Blackmail or some
covert political agenda?

25:17.000 --> 25:18.792
'Are you really
that dead inside'

25:18.875 --> 25:21.417
'that you can't even
imagine another reason?'

25:24.000 --> 25:29.250
Alright, alright, obviously,
we got off on the wrong foot.

25:29.333 --> 25:31.000
Maybe it's my fault.

25:31.083 --> 25:33.667
I crawled up your butt more than
a few times when I got here.

25:34.542 --> 25:36.583
Maybe it's your fault.

25:36.667 --> 25:40.000
Yeah, it's definitely
more your fault than mine, but..

25:41.500 --> 25:44.458
I'm here because
Sheridan wanted a symbol.

25:44.542 --> 25:46.667
Somebody who was
on the other side.

25:46.750 --> 25:49.458
He figured it would bring
the folks back home together.

25:49.542 --> 25:52.458
He also wanted someone
he knew he could trust.

25:52.542 --> 25:54.667
Someone he didn't have
to worry about sandbagging him

25:54.750 --> 25:57.500
or stabbing him in the back
when he wasn't looking.

25:57.583 --> 25:59.375
Someone who would argue
with him when necessary

25:59.458 --> 26:01.750
but would back him
all the way when he was right.

26:01.833 --> 26:04.000
- And that's you.
- That's me.

26:04.833 --> 26:06.125
Why?

26:08.667 --> 26:11.000
It can't leave this room.

26:11.083 --> 26:13.458
I am the soul of discretion.

26:20.500 --> 26:24.458
A very long time ago,
Sheridan and I were married

26:24.542 --> 26:26.542
for all of about three months.

26:26.625 --> 26:28.292
Get out of town.

26:30.208 --> 26:31.167
[whistles]

26:31.250 --> 26:32.375
How many wives has he got?

26:32.458 --> 26:34.667
Just three.

26:34.750 --> 26:37.125
[sighs]
We met fresh out of
officer training school.

26:37.208 --> 26:38.792
We hit it off.

26:38.875 --> 26:40.167
Fell crazy in love.

26:40.250 --> 26:41.625
Got married.

26:41.708 --> 26:43.333
Realized we'd made
a terrible mistake

26:43.417 --> 26:46.042
fell crazy out of love,
and split up.

26:47.542 --> 26:48.708
You see, in a relationship

26:48.792 --> 26:50.167
you gotta take turns
being in charge

26:50.250 --> 26:53.583
but we both wanted to be
in charge all the time.

26:53.667 --> 26:56.917
'We had arguments that could
peel paint off the wall.'

26:58.125 --> 27:00.875
But it was over
a long time ago.

27:00.958 --> 27:02.583
He's not carrying
a torch for me

27:02.667 --> 27:04.833
I'm not carrying one for him.

27:04.917 --> 27:08.583
But the bottom line is
he knows he can trust me

27:08.667 --> 27:13.083
and I know I can trust him,
and that's why I'm here.

27:13.958 --> 27:16.958
[laughing]

27:18.333 --> 27:19.708
What's so amusing?

27:21.083 --> 27:23.208
You. Me.

27:23.292 --> 27:24.917
All of this.

27:25.000 --> 27:26.375
Oh!

27:26.458 --> 27:29.625
If I had a 100 years, I couldn't
have come up with that one.

27:30.458 --> 27:31.875
Well, that's very true.

27:31.958 --> 27:33.292
And maybe that's something
you ought to think about

27:33.375 --> 27:34.708
Mr. Garibaldi.

27:34.792 --> 27:38.583
So, uh, I guess
I can go now, right?

27:39.958 --> 27:41.167
Right?

27:41.250 --> 27:43.500
Not as long as
Bester's still here.

27:43.583 --> 27:44.750
'It's not that
I don't trust you'

27:44.833 --> 27:47.000
'but I don't trust you.'

27:47.958 --> 27:50.292
[beeping]
Lochley, go.

27:50.375 --> 27:52.417
(Zack on radio)
'Captain, we have an official
request from Bester'

27:52.500 --> 27:55.542
'for security personnel to help
him round up those telepaths.'

27:55.625 --> 27:57.417
'What do I tell him?'

27:57.500 --> 27:59.083
Where did it come from?

27:59.167 --> 28:00.875
(Zack)
'Direct from Earthdome.'

28:00.958 --> 28:03.208
Then we can't refuse then.

28:03.292 --> 28:05.833
[sighs]
Give him what he needs,
but no more.

28:07.500 --> 28:09.625
Now the fun really starts.

28:15.042 --> 28:16.417
Help me!
Help me, please!

28:16.500 --> 28:18.542
[grunting]

28:25.500 --> 28:28.542
[intense music]

28:33.708 --> 28:35.917
[instrumental music]

28:39.167 --> 28:40.500
[sighs]

28:47.542 --> 28:50.583
[indistinct chatter]

29:02.875 --> 29:05.917
[music continues]

29:27.958 --> 29:29.458
(Byron)
Lyta.

29:32.917 --> 29:35.958
[music continues]

29:52.833 --> 29:54.208
Byron?

29:56.542 --> 29:58.375
You called me?

29:58.458 --> 29:59.667
Yes.

30:01.375 --> 30:03.333
To say goodbye.

30:03.417 --> 30:05.042
Half my people
have been captured.

30:05.125 --> 30:07.500
The rest will fall soon.
My place is with them.

30:07.583 --> 30:08.667
No!

30:08.750 --> 30:09.708
We can fight them.

30:09.792 --> 30:12.208
Violence is not our way.

30:12.292 --> 30:14.000
We must aspire
to be better than that.

30:14.083 --> 30:16.500
They know you were in charge.

30:16.583 --> 30:17.583
They'll kill you!

30:17.667 --> 30:20.208
It is a distinct possibility

30:20.292 --> 30:23.042
but perhaps there is
a rough justice in that.

30:23.125 --> 30:24.875
It is not your fault, Byron.

30:24.958 --> 30:26.167
Yes, it is!

30:26.250 --> 30:28.708
I should've known better by now.

30:28.792 --> 30:32.458
I was wrong to bring them here,
wrong to trust in others.

30:33.625 --> 30:36.458
And perhaps
I was most wrong of all

30:36.542 --> 30:38.917
to hold out
the possibility of hope

30:39.000 --> 30:43.250
to them, to myself...and to you.

30:45.417 --> 30:47.250
Please.

30:47.333 --> 30:49.375
Don't.

30:49.458 --> 30:51.333
You can stay with me.

30:51.417 --> 30:54.000
I could hide you.

30:54.083 --> 30:55.792
I believe you could.

30:57.250 --> 30:59.125
I believe you would protect me

30:59.208 --> 31:02.583
until the stars themselves
went cold and dead.

31:04.083 --> 31:08.417
But my people need me,
and I must go to them.

31:08.500 --> 31:11.000
You have been kind to us.

31:11.083 --> 31:13.458
Carry out the legacy
to others out there like us

31:13.542 --> 31:15.667
and for me, that will be enough.

31:21.917 --> 31:23.250
Goodbye, Lyta.

31:30.750 --> 31:33.958
(Corwin)
'And we finally got
the cargo lifts operating'

31:34.042 --> 31:35.958
at 100% capacity.

31:36.042 --> 31:38.208
Ms. Connelly expects
the backlog should be cleared

31:38.292 --> 31:40.125
in a couple of hours.

31:40.208 --> 31:41.542
Good. Good.

31:42.583 --> 31:44.000
So, uh..

31:44.083 --> 31:45.375
...how goes the witch hunt?

31:45.458 --> 31:46.792
Ah, Bester's people
have almost all

31:46.875 --> 31:48.417
the rogue telepaths in custody.

31:48.500 --> 31:50.458
We figure there's maybe
half a dozen left

31:50.542 --> 31:52.125
plus the leader.

31:52.208 --> 31:54.250
They should have them in hand
by the end of the day.

31:54.333 --> 31:56.208
Any response from Earth
on our request to delay

31:56.292 --> 31:58.250
turning over the prisoners
to Bester's custody?

31:58.333 --> 32:00.083
Negative,
and I wouldn't expect one

32:00.167 --> 32:02.000
until after
they've already left.

32:02.083 --> 32:04.208
Have Bester's people
broken any station regs

32:04.292 --> 32:07.667
uh, roughed anybody up,
arrested the wrong people?

32:07.750 --> 32:09.500
No, they've kept
their noses so clean

32:09.583 --> 32:12.000
you could eat off them.

32:12.083 --> 32:13.833
Not an image I wanted
this early in the morning

32:13.917 --> 32:15.167
but thank you
very much, Mr. Allan.

32:15.250 --> 32:17.333
Uh, any other reports?

32:17.417 --> 32:19.583
Alright. Dismissed.

32:22.125 --> 32:24.917
Uh, captain, one thing.

32:25.000 --> 32:26.167
The other day,
Delenn asked

32:26.250 --> 32:27.833
if I'd be willing
to work with her

32:27.917 --> 32:30.667
on putting together a medical
catalog of the other races.

32:30.750 --> 32:33.292
Genetic diseases,
cross-species infection rates

32:33.375 --> 32:34.667
the whole nine yards.

32:34.750 --> 32:37.167
Well, I hope you said yes.
Sounds like a big deal.

32:37.250 --> 32:39.042
It is, and since it means

32:39.125 --> 32:40.833
spending more time
outside of Medlab

32:40.917 --> 32:43.708
I figured I'd clear it
with you first.

32:43.792 --> 32:45.083
Not a problem.

32:45.167 --> 32:48.125
Dr. Hobbs can pick up any slack
should there be an emer..

32:49.458 --> 32:52.208
Did you say cross-species
infection rates?

32:52.292 --> 32:53.250
Yes.

32:53.333 --> 32:54.958
I-it's not a big problem yet

32:55.042 --> 32:57.417
but alien biologies
range all over the place

32:57.500 --> 32:58.625
and there's not
much common ground

32:58.708 --> 33:00.000
but it has been
known to happen.

33:00.083 --> 33:01.208
To humans?

33:01.292 --> 33:02.542
On occasion, yeah.

33:02.625 --> 33:04.125
That's why we had to
come up with a system

33:04.208 --> 33:05.708
of standardizing
lengths of quarantine

33:05.792 --> 33:07.375
and developing vaccines, and..

33:07.458 --> 33:09.625
Could you put that
in writing for me?

33:09.708 --> 33:11.292
Yeah, I guess I could.

33:11.375 --> 33:12.958
Good. Have it on my desk
in half an hour.

33:13.042 --> 33:14.708
And thank Delenn for the idea.

33:14.792 --> 33:16.750
I gotta go ruin somebody's day.

33:18.375 --> 33:21.458
[instrumental music]

33:41.458 --> 33:43.958
I was thinking about
what you said the other day

33:44.042 --> 33:46.458
about wanting to serve
the Alliance more than you do

33:46.542 --> 33:48.750
which is already considerable.

33:48.833 --> 33:50.750
As you may know, the cruiser

33:50.833 --> 33:53.250
that was going to take
Londo back to Centauri Prime

33:53.333 --> 33:55.375
was sabotaged and destroyed.

33:55.458 --> 33:58.000
'He has many enemies
in the Royal Court.'

33:58.083 --> 34:00.167
He has many enemies everywhere.

34:00.250 --> 34:01.750
It's what he does best.

34:01.833 --> 34:03.583
If we lose the Centauri

34:03.667 --> 34:06.083
we lose one of our
most important allies

34:06.167 --> 34:09.125
so we cannot allow
anything to happen to him.

34:09.208 --> 34:10.375
I agree.

34:10.458 --> 34:12.083
He should have a bodyguard
assigned to him

34:12.167 --> 34:14.250
at all times
while he is there.

34:14.333 --> 34:17.292
Someone we can rely on,
someone, uh..

34:17.375 --> 34:18.667
Someone we can trust.

34:18.750 --> 34:20.333
'Someone strong.'

34:21.167 --> 34:22.875
Strong enough to..

34:23.625 --> 34:25.125
Oh!

34:25.208 --> 34:26.833
You can't be serious.

34:26.917 --> 34:27.958
Just think.

34:28.042 --> 34:29.458
What a symbol it would make.

34:29.542 --> 34:32.083
To have a Narn guarding
the life of the Centauri.

34:32.167 --> 34:34.250
Well, yes, it would mean
my people will now have

34:34.333 --> 34:36.542
two targets to shoot at
instead of just the one.

34:36.625 --> 34:39.208
Or they will learn
from your example.

34:39.292 --> 34:42.375
The Alliance is about learning
to overcome our distrust

34:42.458 --> 34:44.208
and form a new community.

34:44.292 --> 34:46.167
Can you think
of a better symbol?

34:46.250 --> 34:49.333
No, and I'm trying, believe me.

34:49.417 --> 34:51.083
You would naturally
have to accompany him

34:51.167 --> 34:54.292
on all state business,
and be there to guard him.

34:54.375 --> 34:57.417
In the palace.
In the Royal Court.

35:00.917 --> 35:05.000
A Narn in the Centauri
Royal Court?

35:05.083 --> 35:07.833
[laughing]

35:07.917 --> 35:11.583
It is a curiously
satisfying image, Delenn.

35:11.667 --> 35:13.708
Yes, it is.

35:13.792 --> 35:16.625
Alright, Delenn, I accept
if only to see their faces.

35:16.708 --> 35:17.750
Thank you.

35:17.833 --> 35:20.292
This is the greatest
challenge of my life.

35:22.875 --> 35:26.083
Why I'm thanking you for that,
I don't know, but there it is.

35:26.167 --> 35:27.583
Thank you.

35:33.542 --> 35:35.042
Oh, captain.

35:35.125 --> 35:37.042
You'll be pleased to know
we're just about finished.

35:37.125 --> 35:39.125
The prisoners have all been
located and arrested

35:39.208 --> 35:40.500
and will be on
the next shuttle out.

35:40.583 --> 35:42.708
Good. Good. I can't wait
to get them out of here.

35:42.792 --> 35:45.917
Unfortunately, there has been
a bit of a complication.

35:46.792 --> 35:48.542
What complication?

35:48.625 --> 35:50.167
These telepaths have been
traveling around

35:50.250 --> 35:52.625
for upwards of three,
four years.

35:52.708 --> 35:55.250
They've been in and out of
every federation in the cluster.

35:55.333 --> 35:57.833
Hell, they've been to planets
that aren't even on the charts.

35:57.917 --> 35:59.833
They're drifters, captain.
It goes with the territory.

35:59.917 --> 36:02.792
I understand, but we can't
turn them over to your custody

36:02.875 --> 36:04.958
until they've had
a full medical workup.

36:05.042 --> 36:06.542
We have to make sure
they're not carrying

36:06.625 --> 36:08.375
any unidentified viruses.

36:08.458 --> 36:10.583
You can't be serious.

36:10.667 --> 36:15.000
"Earth Alliance medical routine,
number 7-2-5-I-T-7."

36:15.083 --> 36:16.458
Dr. Franklin just hit me
with the paperwork

36:16.542 --> 36:18.417
a couple of hours ago.

36:18.500 --> 36:19.792
"No interstellar traveler

36:19.875 --> 36:21.542
"who's been in unknown space
shall be allowed

36:21.625 --> 36:23.292
"within the borders
of Earth-controlled space

36:23.375 --> 36:26.583
until after a 60 day
quarantine period."

36:26.667 --> 36:29.583
I have to follow the rules,
Mr. Bester, same as you.

36:29.667 --> 36:31.375
So you're saying..

36:32.458 --> 36:34.417
...I can't take them?

36:34.500 --> 36:36.167
I'm saying
you can't take them now.

36:36.250 --> 36:38.917
Look, I'm just as distressed
over this as you are.

36:39.000 --> 36:41.333
Come back in 60 days,
and they're all yours.

36:43.500 --> 36:46.542
(Bester)
Let me at least take him.

36:46.625 --> 36:49.042
I wish I could, but I can't.

36:49.125 --> 36:51.000
Look, I'm on your side here.

36:51.083 --> 36:53.292
I've worked with you, now
I'm asking you to work with me

36:53.375 --> 36:55.208
just, just for a little while.

36:55.292 --> 36:58.125
I want your personal guarantee
that you won't let them go

36:58.208 --> 36:59.875
that you'll keep
them in custody.

36:59.958 --> 37:02.250
- Especially this one.
- You have it.

37:02.333 --> 37:04.125
They will not be allowed
to leave Babylon 5.

37:04.208 --> 37:06.125
I'll put it in writing
if you like.

37:07.625 --> 37:09.125
Alright.

37:09.208 --> 37:10.792
As a down payment
on what I hope will be

37:10.875 --> 37:13.458
a long
and rewarding relationship

37:13.542 --> 37:15.750
'I'll wait the 60 days.'

37:15.833 --> 37:18.500
I've waited this long, another
month or two won't matter.

37:19.667 --> 37:22.000
Just keep an eye on them,
captain.

37:22.083 --> 37:25.417
Don't trust them for a second
because sooner or later

37:25.500 --> 37:27.792
they will turn on you.

37:30.042 --> 37:32.917
You know all about that,
don't you, Byron?

37:36.083 --> 37:37.833
See you in 60 days.

37:49.417 --> 37:51.458
Wait until their ship
has left, and then, uh..

37:51.542 --> 37:53.667
...leave the key to the cell
where they can find it.

37:53.750 --> 37:56.542
Then turn your back
for, say, ten minutes.

37:59.500 --> 38:01.833
I have just stuck my neck
out for you, Byron.

38:01.917 --> 38:05.000
I don't like doing it,
but I have my orders.

38:05.083 --> 38:06.667
I've gotten you
a 60-day reprieve.

38:06.750 --> 38:09.667
That's all I could do.
That's all I had to do.

38:09.750 --> 38:11.167
After 60 days,
maybe we'll figure out

38:11.250 --> 38:12.333
something else.
If not--

38:12.417 --> 38:15.042
I understand. Thank you.

38:15.125 --> 38:16.583
And one more thing.

38:16.667 --> 38:18.083
Now that I've just promised him

38:18.167 --> 38:20.375
that you or your people
will not leave the station

38:20.458 --> 38:24.542
I too am stuck with that
promise, and so are you.

38:24.625 --> 38:28.000
[sighs]
Get on over to Medlab, and have
Dr. Franklin have a look at you.

38:28.083 --> 38:29.708
I will.

38:29.792 --> 38:31.917
After the rest
of my people are freed.

38:32.833 --> 38:34.292
Good day.

38:39.208 --> 38:40.208
He's an interesting man.

38:40.292 --> 38:41.875
He's a martyr.
I've seen it before.

38:41.958 --> 38:44.000
We had a guy on IO
just like him.

38:44.083 --> 38:45.708
Real charismatic.

38:45.792 --> 38:47.542
Got this whole movement
going around him.

38:47.625 --> 38:49.125
Well, there's
nothing more appealing

38:49.208 --> 38:50.333
than knowing that
someone's willing

38:50.417 --> 38:51.500
to lay down their life for you.

38:51.583 --> 38:52.875
And nothing more dangerous.

(Londo)
'G'Kar?'

39:34.125 --> 39:36.750
You've assigned G'Kar
as my bodyguard?

39:36.833 --> 39:39.625
Yes, I think your generosity
in working with him

39:39.708 --> 39:41.917
will be an excellent
symbol of unity

39:42.000 --> 39:44.083
for all the other races who
could have joined the Alliance.

39:44.167 --> 39:45.875
- A symbol.
- Yes.

39:45.958 --> 39:47.708
And you tried
this line on G'Kar?

39:47.792 --> 39:49.125
- I did.
- And did it work?

39:49.208 --> 39:50.458
Completely.

39:50.542 --> 39:52.625
Great Maker.

39:52.708 --> 39:54.625
Alright, alright, Delenn

39:54.708 --> 39:57.292
but mark my word,
this is going to be trouble.

39:57.375 --> 39:59.833
Everything of value is, Londo.

40:01.375 --> 40:02.958
Have a good flight.

40:07.208 --> 40:08.625
I want the aisle seat.

40:08.708 --> 40:10.750
Oh, no, no, no.
You sit on the inside.

40:10.833 --> 40:12.792
I want the aisle.

40:12.875 --> 40:15.417
If you sit on the aisle,
I cannot protect you.

40:15.500 --> 40:18.625
But I don't like the inside.

40:18.708 --> 40:19.667
It's too cramped.

40:19.750 --> 40:21.417
I become nauseous.

40:21.500 --> 40:23.375
I'll make sure
they have a supply

40:23.458 --> 40:25.167
of space sickness bags.

40:25.250 --> 40:26.667
[Londo sighs]

40:28.875 --> 40:29.917
Captain?

40:30.000 --> 40:31.458
Oh, lieutenant.
Care to join me?

40:31.542 --> 40:33.167
I'm just having
a quick bite before I crash.

40:33.250 --> 40:34.542
No, it's okay.

40:34.625 --> 40:36.667
I ate, ate something
a little while ago.

40:36.750 --> 40:38.083
I just want to say that

40:38.167 --> 40:40.500
I heard how you handled
the telepath problem.

40:40.583 --> 40:43.458
- That was good thinking.
- Adequate.

40:43.542 --> 40:46.833
Solves the immediate problem,
but that's all I had to do.

40:46.917 --> 40:48.375
I learned that
on my last command.

40:48.458 --> 40:50.875
You don't have to solve
every problem all at once.

40:50.958 --> 40:53.208
Problems are solved in pieces.

40:53.292 --> 40:55.000
If you're on the seventh floor
of a burning building

40:55.083 --> 40:57.000
you can either die
or jump out the window.

40:57.083 --> 40:58.542
Once you're out the window

40:58.625 --> 41:00.792
you're alive for another
two seconds, during which time

41:00.875 --> 41:02.750
you figure out the solution
to the next problem

41:02.833 --> 41:04.625
and so on and so on.

41:04.708 --> 41:07.833
Ah, but this,
this telepath problem

41:07.917 --> 41:09.500
it's gonna take me
a while to unravel.

41:09.583 --> 41:11.125
Well, you did the right thing.

41:11.208 --> 41:12.542
That's what matters.

41:13.958 --> 41:16.792
I hope so. I really do.

41:16.875 --> 41:18.375
But to tell you the truth

41:18.458 --> 41:22.042
I get this nagging suspicion
that maybe Bester was right.

41:22.125 --> 41:23.625
This thing will
blow up in our face.

41:23.708 --> 41:25.375
It worries me.

41:25.458 --> 41:29.125
I also have this nagging feeling
that I'm forgetting something.

41:29.208 --> 41:31.208
I'm sure you'll figure it out.

41:31.292 --> 41:32.917
Goodnight, captain.

41:33.000 --> 41:35.083
Goodnight, lieutenant.

41:39.083 --> 41:40.500
Oh, no.
