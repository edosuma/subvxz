01:25.586 --> 01:26.919
Kissing it all good-bye.
These four stinkin' walls,

01:26.920 --> 01:28.172
six flights up,

01:28.172 --> 01:29.005
six flights up,

01:29.006 --> 01:31.133
the el that roars by at 3 a.m.

01:31.216 --> 01:33.177
Like a cast-iron wind.

01:33.218 --> 01:34.803
Kiss 'em good-bye for me, Maury.

01:34.887 --> 01:37.347
I'll miss 'em...
like hell I will.

01:37.389 --> 01:38.472
Dreamin' again.

01:38.473 --> 01:40.851
Not anymore, Lil.
I'm awake now,

01:40.893 --> 01:44.021
awake for the first time in years.

01:44.104 --> 01:45.522
Uncle Dave said it...

01:45.606 --> 01:47.024
"Daylight is a dream

01:47.065 --> 01:49.651
if you live with your eyes closed."

01:49.735 --> 01:52.696
Well, my eyes are open now.
I see the choir.

01:52.779 --> 01:54.823
I know they're dressed in rags,

01:54.907 --> 01:57.075
but we're part of that choir.

01:57.159 --> 01:58.493
Yeah, both of us,

01:58.577 --> 02:00.829
and you, Maury, and Uncle Dave.

02:00.913 --> 02:02.331
Sun's comin' up, kid.

02:02.372 --> 02:04.124
They'll be hawkin' the fish

02:04.208 --> 02:05.626
down on Fulton Street.

02:05.709 --> 02:07.127
Let 'em hawk.

02:07.211 --> 02:09.295
Let 'em sing their hearts out.

02:09.378 --> 02:10.631
That's it, kid.

02:10.714 --> 02:13.133
Take that ruined choir.
Make it sing.

02:13.217 --> 02:14.551
So long, Maury.

02:14.635 --> 02:16.094
So long.

02:18.388 --> 02:20.140
We'll hear from that kid,

02:20.224 --> 02:22.976
and I don't mean a postcard.

02:24.061 --> 02:25.312
Fish!

02:25.395 --> 02:27.564
Fresh fish!

02:29.900 --> 02:32.819
Let's spit on our hands
and get to work.

02:32.903 --> 02:34.321
It's late, Maury.

02:34.404 --> 02:35.822
Not anymore, Lil.

02:35.906 --> 02:37.241
It's early.

02:47.417 --> 02:49.920
- Bravo!
- Bravo!

02:51.797 --> 02:52.881
Bravo!

02:52.923 --> 02:54.883
Bravo!

02:54.925 --> 02:56.510
Bravo!

02:57.928 --> 03:00.222
- Bravo!
- Bravo!

03:04.643 --> 03:08.647
- Author!
- Author!

03:09.690 --> 03:11.984
- Author!
- Author!

03:12.067 --> 03:13.610
- Author!
- Author!

03:13.694 --> 03:16.280
- Author!
- Author!

03:16.363 --> 03:19.157
- Bravo!
- Bravo!

03:30.627 --> 03:33.005
Your table is ready, Monsieur Fink.

03:33.088 --> 03:36.508
In fact, several members of your party
have already arrived.

03:36.592 --> 03:38.010
Is Garland Stanford here?

03:38.093 --> 03:41.054
He called to say
he'd be a few minutes late.

03:41.138 --> 03:43.015
Ah, here we are.

03:43.098 --> 03:46.059
Barton!
Barton, so glad you could make it.

03:46.143 --> 03:48.020
You know Richard St. Claire

03:48.103 --> 03:49.688
and Poppy Carnahan.

03:49.771 --> 03:51.940
Charmed, charmed, charmed.

03:52.024 --> 03:54.567
We're drinking champagne
in honor of the occasion.

03:54.568 --> 03:56.778
Have you seen the Herald?

03:56.862 --> 03:57.988
Not yet.

03:58.071 --> 03:59.364
I won't embarrass you,

03:59.448 --> 04:01.533
but Caven could
hardly contain himself.

04:01.617 --> 04:02.700
More important,

04:02.701 --> 04:04.995
Richard and Poppy here loved the play.

04:05.078 --> 04:06.163
Weeping.

04:06.246 --> 04:07.246
Copious tears.

04:07.247 --> 04:09.374
What did the Herald say?

04:09.458 --> 04:10.791
I happen to have it.

04:10.792 --> 04:11.834
Please, Derek...

04:11.835 --> 04:13.295
"Bare Ruined Choirs:

04:13.337 --> 04:15.839
Triumph of the Common Man.

04:15.881 --> 04:18.091
The star of Bare Ruined Choirs

04:18.175 --> 04:20.469
was nowhere seen
on the stage last night,

04:20.552 --> 04:22.887
though the thespians
acquitted themselves admirably.

04:22.888 --> 04:24.640
The find of the evening

04:24.723 --> 04:27.684
was the author of this drama
about simple folk,

04:27.768 --> 04:29.186
fishmongers, in fact,

04:29.228 --> 04:30.979
whose brute struggle for existence

04:31.021 --> 04:33.649
cannot quite quell their longing
for something higher.

04:33.732 --> 04:35.192
The playwright finds nobility

04:35.234 --> 04:37.027
in the most squalid corners

04:37.110 --> 04:39.738
and poetry in the most callous speech.

04:39.821 --> 04:42.824
A tough new voice
in the American theater has arrived,

04:42.908 --> 04:45.369
and the owner of that voice is named...

04:45.410 --> 04:47.371
Barton Fink."

04:47.412 --> 04:51.166
They'll be wrapping fish in it
in the morning.

04:51.208 --> 04:53.001
Cynic.

04:53.085 --> 04:55.712
I can't start listening to the critics,

04:55.796 --> 04:58.715
and I can't kid myself
about my own work.

04:58.757 --> 05:00.717
A writer writes from his gut.

05:00.759 --> 05:03.720
His gut tells him
what's good and what's...

05:03.804 --> 05:05.722
merely adequate.

05:06.932 --> 05:09.893
I don't pretend to be a critic,

05:09.935 --> 05:12.479
but Lord knows I have a gut,

05:12.563 --> 05:16.024
and my gut tells me it's simply...

05:16.108 --> 05:18.193
marvelous.

05:18.235 --> 05:20.571
And a charming gut it is.

05:20.654 --> 05:22.489
Oh, you dog.

05:22.573 --> 05:24.616
Aroo!

05:24.700 --> 05:26.034
Oh, stop.

05:31.498 --> 05:34.418
I thought you were going to join us.

05:34.459 --> 05:37.546
Jesus, Garland,
you left me alone with those people?

05:37.588 --> 05:38.754
Don't panic.

05:38.755 --> 05:40.883
I'll join you in a minute.

05:40.924 --> 05:43.510
We have to talk a little business.

05:43.594 --> 05:46.513
I've just been on the phone
to Los Angeles.

05:46.597 --> 05:49.516
Barton, Capitol Pictures wants to
put you under contract.

05:49.600 --> 05:52.019
They've offered you $1,000 a week.

05:52.102 --> 05:55.022
I think I can get them
to go as high as 2.

05:55.105 --> 05:56.439
To do what?

05:56.440 --> 05:58.650
What do you do for a living?

05:58.734 --> 06:00.527
I'm not sure anymore.

06:00.611 --> 06:03.989
I guess I try to make a difference.

06:04.072 --> 06:07.117
There's no pressure here
because I respect you,

06:07.201 --> 06:09.411
but a brief tenure in Hollywood

06:09.453 --> 06:11.663
could support you through the writing

06:11.747 --> 06:13.499
of any number of plays.

06:13.582 --> 06:15.000
I don't know, Garland.

06:15.083 --> 06:17.294
My place is here right now.

06:17.377 --> 06:20.130
I feel I'm on the brink of success.

06:20.214 --> 06:22.508
I'd say you're already enjoying some.

06:22.591 --> 06:24.176
No. Don't you see?

06:24.259 --> 06:27.137
Not the kind of success
where critics fawn over you

06:27.221 --> 06:29.973
or producers like Derek
make a lot of money.

06:30.057 --> 06:31.850
No. A real success.

06:31.934 --> 06:33.977
The success we've been dreaming about...

06:34.061 --> 06:36.980
the creation of a new living theater

06:37.064 --> 06:40.067
of and about and for the common man.

06:40.150 --> 06:42.611
If I ran off to Hollywood now,

06:42.653 --> 06:44.071
I'd be making money,

06:44.154 --> 06:45.989
going to parties,
meeting the big shots,

06:46.073 --> 06:47.824
but I'd be cutting myself off

06:47.908 --> 06:50.202
from the wellspring of that success,

06:50.285 --> 06:51.870
from the common man.

06:53.997 --> 06:57.793
Oh, I guess I'm spouting off again.

06:57.835 --> 06:59.586
You see Caven's review?

06:59.670 --> 07:01.338
No. What did it say?

07:01.421 --> 07:02.881
Here, take my copy.

07:02.965 --> 07:04.800
You're the toast of Broadway,

07:04.842 --> 07:06.635
and you have an opportunity

07:06.677 --> 07:10.097
to redeem that for a little cash...

07:10.180 --> 07:12.432
Strike that.
A lot of cash.

07:12.516 --> 07:17.479
The common man will still be here
when you get back.

07:17.563 --> 07:18.981
Who knows?

07:19.022 --> 07:22.484
They may even have one or two of them
out in Hollywood.

07:22.526 --> 07:25.153
That's a rationalization, Garland.

07:25.237 --> 07:29.575
Barton, it was a joke.

08:54.910 --> 08:57.579
Welcome to Hotel Earle.
May I help you?

08:57.621 --> 08:59.081
I'm checking in.

08:59.122 --> 09:00.415
Barton Fink.

09:00.457 --> 09:03.085
All righty.

09:04.711 --> 09:06.755
Okay...

09:06.839 --> 09:09.091
F-I-N-K?

09:11.802 --> 09:13.010
"Fink, Barton."

09:13.011 --> 09:14.471
That must be you, huh?

09:14.555 --> 09:15.597
Must be.

09:15.681 --> 09:20.269
Okay, then everything
seems to be in order.

09:20.352 --> 09:23.438
Everything seems to be in order.

09:23.522 --> 09:24.773
Just...

09:26.024 --> 09:28.819
Are you a trans or a res?

09:28.902 --> 09:29.987
Excuse me?

09:30.070 --> 09:31.613
Transient or resident?

09:31.697 --> 09:32.781
I...

09:32.865 --> 09:34.825
I... I... I don't know.

09:34.867 --> 09:37.077
I mean, I'll be here indefinitely.

09:37.160 --> 09:39.997
Res. That's 25.50 a week
payable in advance.

09:40.080 --> 09:41.790
Check-out time's 12:00 sharp,

09:41.874 --> 09:43.792
only forget that.
You're a res.

09:43.834 --> 09:45.042
If you need anything,
pick up your personal in-room telephone.

09:45.043 --> 09:47.086
If you need anything,
pick up your personal in-room telephone.

09:47.087 --> 09:48.421
My name is Chet.

09:48.422 --> 09:49.840
Although we provide privacy

09:49.882 --> 09:51.341
for the residential guests,

09:51.425 --> 09:53.135
we're a full-service hotel,

09:53.218 --> 09:54.511
including complimentary shoe shine.

09:54.595 --> 09:56.180
My name is Chet.

09:57.764 --> 09:58.974
Okay.

10:04.188 --> 10:06.064
Those your only bags?

10:06.148 --> 10:09.193
The others are being sent.

10:09.276 --> 10:12.321
Welcome to Los Angeles, Mr. Fink.

10:24.625 --> 10:26.084
Six, please.

10:29.296 --> 10:32.424
Next stop... six.

10:40.140 --> 10:42.768
This stop... six.

13:44.575 --> 13:46.535
Is that him?

13:46.577 --> 13:49.872
Is that Barton Fink?

13:49.913 --> 13:51.331
Let me at him.

13:51.415 --> 13:54.042
Let me put my arms
around this guy.

13:54.084 --> 13:56.044
Let me hug this guy.

13:56.086 --> 13:58.088
How the hell are ya?

13:58.130 --> 13:59.173
Good trip?

13:59.256 --> 14:00.716
My name's Jack Lipnick.

14:00.757 --> 14:02.634
You know that.
You read the papers.

14:02.718 --> 14:04.428
Lou treating you all right?

14:04.511 --> 14:06.722
What's the matter
with your face?

14:06.805 --> 14:09.141
What's the matter
with his face, Lou?

14:09.224 --> 14:10.601
It's not so bad.

14:10.684 --> 14:12.686
A mosquito in my room.

14:12.769 --> 14:14.061
Where'd we put him?

14:14.062 --> 14:15.439
I'm at the Earle.

14:15.522 --> 14:17.941
Never heard of it.
Let's move him.

14:18.025 --> 14:19.358
Stay at my place.

14:19.359 --> 14:20.944
I wanted a place a little less...

14:21.028 --> 14:23.530
Less Hollywood. Say it.
It's not a dirty word.

14:23.614 --> 14:25.657
Say whatever you want.

14:25.741 --> 14:28.285
The writer is king
at Capitol Pictures.

14:28.368 --> 14:29.620
Look at your paycheck.

14:29.703 --> 14:31.788
That's what
we think of writers.

14:31.872 --> 14:34.791
So, what kind of pictures
does he like?

14:34.875 --> 14:37.503
Mr. Fink hasn't given
a preference, Mr. Lipnick.

14:37.586 --> 14:39.671
So, how about it, Bart?

14:39.755 --> 14:41.673
Well, uh, to be honest,

14:41.757 --> 14:44.468
I don't go to the pictures much.

14:44.551 --> 14:45.635
That's okay.

14:45.636 --> 14:47.346
You probably
walked in here

14:47.429 --> 14:49.973
thinking that was going
to be a handicap,

14:50.057 --> 14:52.976
thinking we wanted people
who knew something about the medium,

14:53.060 --> 14:55.603
thinking there's technical
mumbo jumbo to learn.

14:55.604 --> 14:57.147
You were dead wrong.

14:57.231 --> 15:00.442
There's only one thing...
Can you tell a story?

15:00.484 --> 15:02.736
Can you make us laugh,
make us cry,

15:02.819 --> 15:05.364
make us want
to break out in song?

15:05.447 --> 15:06.823
That more than one thing?

15:06.907 --> 15:09.910
I run this dump, and I don't know
technical mumbo jumbo.

15:10.035 --> 15:11.578
Why do I run it?

15:11.662 --> 15:14.122
'Cause I got horse sense, showmanship!

15:14.164 --> 15:16.959
And also I'm bigger
and meaner and louder

15:17.000 --> 15:19.378
than any other kike
in this town.

15:19.461 --> 15:21.922
I don't mean my dick's
bigger than yours.

15:22.005 --> 15:24.424
It's not a sexual thing.
Coffee?

15:27.010 --> 15:28.470
Yes, thank you.

15:28.554 --> 15:29.513
Lou!

15:37.020 --> 15:39.940
Used to have shares
in the company,

15:39.982 --> 15:41.148
ownership interest,

15:41.149 --> 15:43.735
got bought out...
muscled out.

15:43.819 --> 15:46.738
We keep him around.
He's got a family.

15:46.822 --> 15:48.156
Poor schmuck.
He's sensitive.

15:48.198 --> 15:50.533
Don't mention the old days.
Hell, say whatever you want.

15:50.534 --> 15:51.994
Look, barring a preference,

15:52.035 --> 15:54.997
you'll be working on
a wrestling picture... Wallace Beery.

15:55.038 --> 15:58.000
They say you know
the poetry of the street.

15:58.083 --> 15:59.918
That rules out
westerns, pirates,

16:00.002 --> 16:01.837
screwball, Bible, Roman...

16:01.920 --> 16:04.423
I'm not some guy
that thinks poetic is fruity.

16:04.506 --> 16:05.924
We're together on that.

16:06.008 --> 16:07.926
I'm from New York myself.

16:08.010 --> 16:10.971
Minsk... if you want
to go all the way back,

16:11.013 --> 16:13.640
which we won't
if you don't mind.

16:13.724 --> 16:15.434
People will say to you...

16:15.517 --> 16:18.145
Wallace Beery, wrestling...
it's a B picture.

16:18.187 --> 16:19.605
You tell them... bullshit!

16:19.688 --> 16:22.858
We don't make B pictures
here at Capitol.

16:22.900 --> 16:26.236
Let's put a stop
to that rumor right now.

16:30.032 --> 16:31.199
Thanks, Lou.

16:31.200 --> 16:32.659
Join us.
Join us.

16:32.743 --> 16:35.496
We're talking about
the Wally Beery picture.

16:35.537 --> 16:37.206
Excellent picture.

16:37.247 --> 16:39.541
Got a treatment on it yet?

16:39.625 --> 16:41.293
We just bought the story.

16:41.376 --> 16:42.836
Saturday Evening Post.

16:42.878 --> 16:44.296
The hell with the story.

16:44.379 --> 16:45.631
Wally Beery's a wrestler.

16:45.714 --> 16:48.008
Give me his hopes, his dreams.

16:48.050 --> 16:50.969
Naturally he gets mixed up
with a bad element

16:51.053 --> 16:53.889
and a romantic interest
or else an orphan.

16:53.972 --> 16:57.643
Lou, think Wally's too old
for a romantic interest?

17:00.687 --> 17:01.980
Look at me.

17:02.064 --> 17:04.023
A writer in the room,

17:04.066 --> 17:06.777
and I'm asking Lou
about the goddamn story.

17:06.859 --> 17:08.237
Which is it, Bart?

17:08.319 --> 17:10.781
Orphan?
Dame?

17:13.992 --> 17:15.452
Both maybe?

17:19.498 --> 17:22.041
Maybe we should do a treatment.

17:22.125 --> 17:24.752
Hell!
Let Bart take a crack at it.

17:24.837 --> 17:27.297
He'll get into the swing of things

17:27.381 --> 17:29.258
or I don't know writers.

17:29.341 --> 17:31.927
Let's make it a dame.
Keep it simple.

17:32.010 --> 17:33.428
The important thing

17:33.512 --> 17:36.431
is we all want it to have
that Barton Fink feeling.

17:36.515 --> 17:38.308
We all have that feeling,

17:38.392 --> 17:40.143
but since you're Barton Fink,

17:40.227 --> 17:42.437
I'm assuming you have it in spades.

17:42.521 --> 17:43.813
I like you.

17:43.814 --> 17:45.941
If all my writers
were like you,

17:46.024 --> 17:47.943
I wouldn't have
to get involved.

17:48.026 --> 17:50.946
Have something
by the end of the week.

17:53.615 --> 17:56.368
I heard about your show,
by the way.

17:56.451 --> 17:59.246
My man in New York saw it.

17:59.288 --> 18:01.832
Says it's damn moving,
a little fruity,

18:01.915 --> 18:04.293
but I guess you know
what you're doing.

18:04.376 --> 18:05.794
Thanks for your heart.

18:05.836 --> 18:08.255
We need more heart
in motion pictures.

18:08.297 --> 18:10.299
We're all expecting great things.

20:31.064 --> 20:32.524
Front desk.

20:32.608 --> 20:34.484
Hello? Uh, Chet?

20:34.568 --> 20:35.652
Speaking.

20:35.736 --> 20:38.614
This is Barton Fink in room 621.

20:38.697 --> 20:42.993
Yes. There's, uh, someone in the room
next door to mine...

20:43.076 --> 20:44.161
623...

20:44.244 --> 20:46.997
and he's, uh...

20:47.080 --> 20:48.332
he's, uh...

20:49.917 --> 20:54.046
making a lot of... noise.

20:54.129 --> 20:56.882
I'll take care of it
right away, sir.

20:56.965 --> 20:58.175
Thank you.

21:08.560 --> 21:11.104
Hello.

21:11.188 --> 21:12.981
What?

21:13.065 --> 21:15.108
Huh?

21:15.192 --> 21:17.486
Who?

21:50.602 --> 21:52.396
Did you...

21:55.148 --> 21:57.234
Somebody just complained.

21:57.317 --> 21:58.652
No. I didn't.

21:58.694 --> 22:01.154
I mean, I did call down,

22:01.196 --> 22:02.488
not to complain exactly.

22:02.489 --> 22:04.575
I was concerned that you might...

22:04.658 --> 22:06.451
not that it's my business...

22:06.535 --> 22:08.912
might be in some kind of... distress.

22:08.996 --> 22:12.249
See, I was trying to work,
and it's...

22:12.332 --> 22:14.543
Well, it was... difficult.

22:19.173 --> 22:20.299
Yeah.

22:20.382 --> 22:22.968
I'm damned sorry
if I bothered you.

22:23.051 --> 22:24.469
The damn walls here...

22:24.553 --> 22:26.471
I just apologize like hell.

22:26.555 --> 22:27.973
My name's Charlie Meadows.

22:28.056 --> 22:29.850
I guess we're neighbors.

22:29.892 --> 22:31.058
Barton Fink.

22:31.059 --> 22:32.477
Neighbor, I'd feel better

22:32.561 --> 22:33.979
about the damned inconvenience

22:34.062 --> 22:36.565
if you let me buy you a drink.

22:38.525 --> 22:40.110
That's all right.
Really.

22:40.194 --> 22:41.612
Thank you.

22:41.695 --> 22:43.071
All right, hell.

22:43.155 --> 22:44.573
You trying to work,

22:44.656 --> 22:46.533
me carrying on in there.

22:46.575 --> 22:48.327
The liquor's good.
What do you say?

22:48.410 --> 22:49.786
You got a glass?

22:49.870 --> 22:52.664
It's the least I can do.

22:52.748 --> 22:55.125
Okay, a quick one.

22:55.209 --> 22:57.085
Sure.

22:57.169 --> 22:59.004
Yeah, just a nip.

23:00.214 --> 23:02.591
I sure do forget myself sometimes.

23:02.674 --> 23:05.594
I feel like a heel...

23:05.636 --> 23:07.554
All the carryings-on next door.

23:07.679 --> 23:09.431
That's okay, I assure you.

23:09.473 --> 23:12.309
It's just I was trying to work.

23:12.392 --> 23:16.271
What kind of work do you do, Barton,
if you don't mind my asking?

23:16.355 --> 23:18.190
Well, I'm a writer, actually.

23:18.273 --> 23:20.776
You don't say?
That's a tough racket.

23:20.859 --> 23:22.694
My hat's off to you.

23:22.778 --> 23:24.863
Damned interesting work, I'd imagine.

23:24.947 --> 23:26.573
It's not easy, but...

23:26.615 --> 23:28.617
Damn difficult, I'd imagine.

23:28.659 --> 23:31.119
And what's your line, Mr. Meadows?

23:31.161 --> 23:32.746
Hell, no, call me Charlie.

23:32.830 --> 23:34.080
Well, Barton...

23:34.081 --> 23:37.000
you might say I sell peace of mind.

23:37.084 --> 23:38.836
Insurance is my game.
Door-to-door.

23:38.919 --> 23:42.297
Human contact's the only way
to move merchandise.

23:42.339 --> 23:45.133
In spite of what you might think,
I'm pretty good at it.

23:45.217 --> 23:46.718
It doesn't surprise me.

23:46.802 --> 23:48.136
I believe in it.

23:48.178 --> 23:50.389
Fire, theft, and casualty aren't things

23:50.472 --> 23:52.683
that only happen to other people.

23:52.766 --> 23:54.226
Writing doesn't work out,

23:54.309 --> 23:56.687
you may want to look into it.

23:56.770 --> 23:59.106
Providing basic needs...
you could do worse.

23:59.147 --> 24:01.149
I'll keep that in mind.

24:01.233 --> 24:03.485
What kind of scribbler are you?

24:03.569 --> 24:05.445
Newspaperman did you say?

24:05.487 --> 24:08.323
No. Actually, I'm writing
for the pictures now.

24:08.407 --> 24:09.658
Pictures?

24:09.741 --> 24:11.201
Jesus!

24:13.829 --> 24:15.289
Aw, I'm sorry, brother.

24:15.330 --> 24:17.624
I was just sitting here thinking

24:17.666 --> 24:21.128
I was talking to some ambitious
youngster eager to make good.

24:21.211 --> 24:23.088
Hell, you've got it made.

24:23.172 --> 24:25.215
Beating out that competition?

24:25.299 --> 24:27.801
And me being patronizing?

24:29.761 --> 24:32.014
Is the egg showing or what?

24:32.097 --> 24:34.850
Actually, I'm just starting out
in the movies,

24:34.933 --> 24:37.853
though I was well established
in New York,

24:37.936 --> 24:39.646
some renown there.

24:39.688 --> 24:42.107
Oh, it's an exciting time, then.

24:42.191 --> 24:44.735
I'm not the best-read mug on the planet,

24:44.818 --> 24:48.113
so it's not surprising
I didn't recognize your name.

24:48.197 --> 24:50.616
Jesus, I feel like a heel.

24:50.699 --> 24:53.535
That's okay, Charlie.
I'm a playwright.

24:53.577 --> 24:55.954
My shows have only played New York.

24:56.038 --> 24:58.457
The last one got
a hell of a write-up.

24:58.540 --> 25:00.501
Must be why they wanted me.

25:00.542 --> 25:02.419
Why not?
Everyone wants quality.

25:02.503 --> 25:06.882
What kind of venue...
that is to say,

25:06.965 --> 25:08.383
thematically,

25:08.467 --> 25:10.260
um...

25:10.344 --> 25:12.221
What do I write about?

25:13.680 --> 25:16.099
Caught me trying to be fancy.

25:16.183 --> 25:17.643
Yeah, that's it, Bart.

25:17.726 --> 25:19.561
Well, that's a good question.

25:19.645 --> 25:22.064
Strange as it may seem, Charlie,

25:22.147 --> 25:24.650
I write about people like you...

25:24.733 --> 25:26.902
the working stiff,
the common man.

25:26.985 --> 25:29.279
Well, ain't that
a kick in the head.

25:29.363 --> 25:32.115
I guess it is, but in a way,

25:32.199 --> 25:33.575
that's exactly the point.

25:33.659 --> 25:36.245
There's a few people in New York...

25:36.328 --> 25:38.038
hopefully our numbers are growing...

25:38.080 --> 25:40.290
who feel we have an opportunity

25:40.374 --> 25:43.794
to forge something real
out of everyday experience,

25:43.877 --> 25:46.296
create a theater for the masses

25:46.380 --> 25:48.632
based on a few simple truths,

25:48.715 --> 25:51.301
not on some shopworn abstractions
about drama

25:51.385 --> 25:53.762
that don't hold true today.

25:53.846 --> 25:56.557
I don't guess this means much to you.

25:56.598 --> 25:58.892
Hell, I could tell you stories.

25:58.934 --> 26:01.770
And that's the point...
we all have stories.

26:01.854 --> 26:05.274
The hopes and dreams
of the common man

26:05.315 --> 26:08.068
are as noble as those of any king.

26:08.110 --> 26:09.570
The stuff of life...

26:09.611 --> 26:12.239
Why shouldn't it be
the stuff of theater?

26:12.281 --> 26:15.242
Why should that be
such a hard pill to swallow?

26:15.284 --> 26:17.578
Don't call it new theater, Charlie.

26:17.619 --> 26:19.079
Call it real theater.

26:19.121 --> 26:20.998
Call it our theater!

26:21.081 --> 26:24.459
I can see you feel
pretty strongly about it.

26:24.543 --> 26:27.462
I don't mean to get up
on my high horse,

26:27.546 --> 26:30.465
but why shouldn't we
look at ourselves up there?

26:30.549 --> 26:33.093
Who cares about
the fifth Earl of Bastrop

26:33.135 --> 26:34.636
and Lady Higginbottom

26:34.678 --> 26:36.096
and...

26:36.138 --> 26:38.682
and who killed Nigel Grinch-Gibbons?

26:38.765 --> 26:40.684
My butt's getting sore already.

26:40.767 --> 26:43.103
Exactly.
You understand what I'm saying

26:43.145 --> 26:45.772
a lot more than some
of these literary types

26:45.814 --> 26:47.441
because you're a real man.

26:47.482 --> 26:50.277
I could tell you some stories...

26:50.319 --> 26:51.737
Sure, you could,

26:51.820 --> 26:54.615
yet many writers insulate themselves
from the common man,

26:54.656 --> 26:56.742
from where they live,

26:56.825 --> 26:59.161
from where they trade
and fight and love

26:59.203 --> 27:00.662
and converse and...

27:00.704 --> 27:02.122
and...

27:03.540 --> 27:05.501
So, naturally, their work suffers

27:05.542 --> 27:07.961
and regresses into
empty formalism and...

27:08.003 --> 27:09.963
Well, I'm spouting off again,

27:10.005 --> 27:12.549
but to put it in your language...

27:12.633 --> 27:14.927
the theater becomes
as phony as a $3 bill.

27:15.010 --> 27:17.095
That's a tragedy right there.

27:17.179 --> 27:20.807
You're all right, Charlie.

27:20.849 --> 27:23.519
I'm glad you stopped by.

27:23.602 --> 27:25.479
I know sometimes I run on.

27:25.521 --> 27:28.774
Well, Christ, if there's
any way I can contribute

27:28.857 --> 27:30.149
or help or whatever...

27:30.150 --> 27:32.444
You can help by just being yourself.

27:32.528 --> 27:35.489
Well, I can tell you some stories.

27:35.531 --> 27:36.656
Now, look...

27:36.657 --> 27:38.617
I'm sorry about
the interruption.

27:38.700 --> 27:41.119
Too much revelry late at night,

27:41.203 --> 27:44.248
you forget there's other people
in the world.

29:25.307 --> 29:27.559
I'll be eating on the lot today.

29:27.643 --> 29:28.643
Who's this?

29:28.644 --> 29:30.020
Barton Fink, Mr. Geezler.

29:30.103 --> 29:30.979
Geisler.

29:31.063 --> 29:32.564
I'm a writer, Mr. Geisler.

29:32.648 --> 29:34.233
Ted Okum said to drop by.

29:34.316 --> 29:35.275
Ever act?

29:35.359 --> 29:36.651
Huh? No. I'm a...

29:36.652 --> 29:39.112
We need Indians
for a Norman Steele western.

29:39.154 --> 29:40.321
I'm a writer.

29:40.322 --> 29:42.991
Writers come and go.
We always need Indians.

29:43.075 --> 29:44.408
I'm a writer.

29:44.409 --> 29:47.329
Ted Okum said you're producing
this Wallace Beery picture.

29:47.371 --> 29:48.747
Ted Okum doesn't know shit.

29:48.831 --> 29:51.332
They've assigned me
enough pictures for a year.

29:51.333 --> 29:52.835
What Ted Okum doesn't know

29:52.876 --> 29:55.336
you could almost squeeze
into the Hollywood Bowl.

29:55.337 --> 29:56.964
Who should I talk to?

29:59.550 --> 30:01.468
Get me Lou Breeze.

30:03.220 --> 30:04.387
Mr. Breeze's office.

30:04.388 --> 30:06.181
Is he in for Mr. Geezler?

30:06.223 --> 30:07.307
Geisler.

30:07.349 --> 30:10.269
Lou! How's Lipnick's ass
smell this morning?

30:10.352 --> 30:12.479
Yeah? Yeah?

30:12.521 --> 30:13.855
Yeah. All right.
Listen.

30:13.856 --> 30:16.316
I got a writer here...
Fink... all screwy.

30:16.358 --> 30:18.860
Says I'm producing
that Wallace Beery wrestling picture.

30:18.861 --> 30:20.487
What am I, the goddamn janitor?

30:20.529 --> 30:22.990
Yeah?
Who'd you get that from?

30:23.031 --> 30:25.659
Well, tell Lipnick
he can kiss my dimpled ass.

30:25.742 --> 30:27.327
No, no. All right. Shit.

30:27.411 --> 30:29.163
All right. No.
All right.

30:31.039 --> 30:32.791
Okay, Fink.

30:32.875 --> 30:34.209
Let's chow.

30:40.382 --> 30:41.675
Don't worry about it.

30:41.717 --> 30:43.177
It's just a B picture.

30:43.218 --> 30:45.095
I bring it in on budget,

30:45.179 --> 30:47.055
they book it without screening it.

30:47.139 --> 30:49.766
Lipnick said he wanted
to look at the script

30:49.850 --> 30:51.602
by the end of the week.

30:51.685 --> 30:53.019
Sure, he did.

30:53.020 --> 30:55.354
He forgot about it
before your ass left his sofa.

30:55.355 --> 30:56.564
He forgot about it
before your ass left his sofa.

30:56.565 --> 30:57.774
Okay.

31:00.402 --> 31:02.738
I'm just having trouble
getting started.

31:02.779 --> 31:04.364
It's funny.
I'm blocked up.

31:04.448 --> 31:05.741
I just feel

31:05.824 --> 31:08.076
like I need
some kind of indication

31:08.118 --> 31:09.578
of what's expected.

31:11.038 --> 31:12.330
Wallace Beery.
Wrestling picture.

31:12.331 --> 31:14.374
What do you need, a road map?

31:14.458 --> 31:16.001
Look,

31:16.084 --> 31:17.336
you're confused.

31:17.419 --> 31:18.962
You need guidance?

31:20.881 --> 31:22.216
Talk to another writer.

31:22.257 --> 31:23.675
Who?

31:23.759 --> 31:24.968
Oh, Jesus.

31:25.052 --> 31:28.222
You throw a rock in here,
you'll hit one.

31:28.263 --> 31:30.682
Do me a favor, Fink...

31:30.766 --> 31:32.267
Throw it hard.

32:49.678 --> 32:53.015
Bill Mayhew.
Sorry about the odor.

32:53.056 --> 32:54.808
Barton Fink.

32:59.897 --> 33:02.024
Jesus. W.P.?

33:02.983 --> 33:04.275
I beg your pardon?

33:04.276 --> 33:06.361
W.P. Mayhew?
The writer?

33:06.445 --> 33:08.906
Just Bill, please.

33:08.989 --> 33:11.074
Bill!

33:11.158 --> 33:13.368
You're the finest novelist
of our time.

33:13.410 --> 33:15.245
Why, thank you, son.
How kind.

33:15.329 --> 33:16.413
My God.

33:16.497 --> 33:20.167
I had no idea
you were in Hollywood.

33:20.209 --> 33:22.127
All of us undomesticated writers

33:22.211 --> 33:24.129
eventually make our way out here

33:24.213 --> 33:26.131
to the great salt lick.

33:26.215 --> 33:27.633
That's probably why

33:27.716 --> 33:30.636
I always have
such a powerful thirst.

33:30.719 --> 33:33.138
A little social lubricant, Mr. Fink?

33:33.222 --> 33:35.182
No. It's a little early for me.

33:40.729 --> 33:42.231
Bill...

33:42.272 --> 33:45.567
if I'm imposing,
you should say so.

33:45.609 --> 33:47.236
I know you're very busy.

33:47.319 --> 33:51.198
I just wanted to ask...
you a favor.

33:51.240 --> 33:55.202
Have you ever written
a wrestling picture?

33:58.247 --> 34:00.582
You are drippin', sir.

34:01.750 --> 34:04.294
They have not invented
a genre of picture

34:04.378 --> 34:07.756
that Bill Mayhew has not
at one time or other

34:07.798 --> 34:09.090
been invited to assay.

34:09.091 --> 34:11.760
Yes, I've taken my stab
at the wrestling form,

34:11.844 --> 34:14.263
as I have stabbed
at so many others.

34:14.304 --> 34:15.597
Well, how do you...

34:15.681 --> 34:17.558
I gather you're a freshman here,

34:17.599 --> 34:19.434
eager for an upperclassman's counsel.

34:19.476 --> 34:21.061
However, just at the moment

34:21.103 --> 34:22.563
I have drinking to do.

34:22.603 --> 34:25.357
Why don't you stop
by my bungalow, number 15,

34:25.440 --> 34:26.732
later on this afternoon?

34:26.733 --> 34:28.485
We will discuss wrestling scenarios

34:28.569 --> 34:30.654
and other things literary.

34:32.781 --> 34:33.697
Sons of bitches!

34:33.699 --> 34:35.324
Sons of bitches!

34:36.284 --> 34:38.203
Where's honey?

34:38.286 --> 34:39.663
Huh?

34:42.958 --> 34:44.877
Honey!

34:44.960 --> 34:46.545
Where's my honey?

34:46.628 --> 34:49.922
The water's lapping up on me, honey!

34:49.965 --> 34:51.382
Honey, just stop it.

34:55.137 --> 34:57.764
I can't.
I'm trying to help you.

34:57.806 --> 34:59.558
Ohh!

34:59.641 --> 35:01.268
Can I help you?

35:01.310 --> 35:02.560
I'm sorry. I...

35:02.561 --> 35:04.021
Where are you, damn it?

35:04.104 --> 35:05.480
My name is Fink.

35:05.564 --> 35:08.025
Bill asked me to drop by
this afternoon.

35:08.108 --> 35:09.442
Is he, uh...

35:09.443 --> 35:10.319
Honey!

35:10.402 --> 35:11.361
In?

35:11.445 --> 35:13.071
Oooh!

35:13.155 --> 35:15.365
Mr. Mayhew is indisposed
at the moment.

35:15.449 --> 35:17.075
Where's my honey?

35:17.159 --> 35:18.367
Is he, uh...

35:18.368 --> 35:19.286
Honey!

35:19.328 --> 35:20.787
Is he okay?

35:20.829 --> 35:22.581
He'll be fine.

35:24.833 --> 35:26.752
Mr. Fink, I'm Audrey Taylor,

35:26.835 --> 35:28.587
Mr. Mayhew's personal secretary.

35:28.670 --> 35:29.922
Where's my honey?

35:30.005 --> 35:33.467
I know this all must sound horrid.

35:33.509 --> 35:34.927
I really do apologize.

35:35.010 --> 35:37.387
Where are you, damn it?

35:38.347 --> 35:40.766
When he can't write, he drinks.

35:40.849 --> 35:42.976
It's so embarrassing.

35:43.018 --> 35:46.396
How about you?
Will you be all right?

35:47.481 --> 35:49.233
I'll be fine.

35:50.317 --> 35:52.277
Are you a writer, Mr. Fink?

35:52.361 --> 35:54.238
Yes. I'm working on a wrestling...

35:54.321 --> 35:55.906
Please call me Barton.

35:56.865 --> 35:58.784
I'll tell Bill you dropped by.

35:58.867 --> 36:01.369
I'm sure he'll want to reschedule
your appointment.

36:01.370 --> 36:05.249
Perhaps you and I can get together
at some point also.

36:05.332 --> 36:07.084
Sorry if that sounds abrupt.

36:07.167 --> 36:08.418
I just...

36:08.502 --> 36:11.880
I... I don't know anyone here in town.

36:13.966 --> 36:16.677
Perhaps the three of us, Mr. Fink.

36:16.718 --> 36:18.804
Please. Barton.

36:18.887 --> 36:20.848
Barton.

36:20.889 --> 36:23.809
You see, Barton,

36:23.892 --> 36:26.144
I'm not just Bill's secretary.

36:26.228 --> 36:28.313
Bill and I are...

36:30.065 --> 36:31.733
in love.

36:33.569 --> 36:35.529
Where's my honey?

36:35.571 --> 36:37.990
Look, I know this must look...

36:39.575 --> 36:41.285
Funny.

36:41.368 --> 36:42.828
Bastard-ass sons of bitches!

36:42.911 --> 36:44.454
I'm sorry.

36:44.538 --> 36:46.957
Please don't judge us, Mr. Fink.

36:47.040 --> 36:48.458
Where's that woman?

36:48.542 --> 36:50.460
Bastard-ass sons of bitches!

36:50.544 --> 36:53.005
The water's lapping up!

36:53.088 --> 36:55.007
Oh, honey!

37:24.953 --> 37:27.206
Oh...

37:27.289 --> 37:28.707
Oh...

37:30.959 --> 37:32.878
Oh...

37:32.961 --> 37:34.713
Oh...

37:37.633 --> 37:40.093
Ah...

37:40.135 --> 37:42.429
Oh...

37:46.892 --> 37:47.976
Oh...

37:49.311 --> 37:51.063
Oh...

38:06.453 --> 38:07.788
Ah...

38:24.555 --> 38:25.889
Howdy, neighbor.

38:25.973 --> 38:28.392
Charlie. How are you?

38:28.475 --> 38:31.895
Oh, Jesus, I hope
I'm not interrupting you again.

38:31.979 --> 38:34.273
Heard you walking around in here.

38:34.356 --> 38:35.732
Figured I'd drop by.

38:35.816 --> 38:38.235
Yeah. Come on in.
Have a seat.

38:38.318 --> 38:40.904
I haven't really gotten started yet.

38:40.988 --> 38:43.031
What happened to your ear?

38:43.115 --> 38:44.908
Oh, yeah.
An ear infection.

38:44.992 --> 38:46.117
Chronic thing.

38:46.118 --> 38:48.871
Goes away for a while,
then it comes back.

38:48.954 --> 38:51.999
I got cotton in it
to staunch the pus.

38:52.124 --> 38:53.374
Don't worry.
It's not contagious.

38:53.375 --> 38:54.835
You seen a doctor?

38:54.877 --> 38:56.503
What's he going to tell me?

38:56.545 --> 38:59.173
Can't trade my head
for a new one.

38:59.256 --> 39:01.967
I guess you're stuck
with the one you got.

39:02.050 --> 39:03.927
I'd invite you to my place,

39:04.011 --> 39:05.679
but it's a goddamn mess.

39:05.721 --> 39:07.347
You married, Bart?

39:08.223 --> 39:09.349
No.

39:09.391 --> 39:12.019
I myself have yet
to be lassoed.

39:12.102 --> 39:14.062
Hey, Bart.

39:14.146 --> 39:18.025
Ouch.

39:21.904 --> 39:23.447
Got a sweetheart?

39:24.364 --> 39:25.574
No.

39:26.700 --> 39:28.994
I guess it's something
about my work.

39:29.077 --> 39:31.288
I get so worked up over it.

39:31.371 --> 39:33.665
I don't have much attention left over,

39:33.749 --> 39:36.627
so it would be a little... unfair.

39:36.710 --> 39:39.129
Yeah. Ladies do ask for attention.

39:39.213 --> 39:41.673
In my experience,
they pretend to give it,

39:41.757 --> 39:43.133
but it's generally a smoke screen

39:43.217 --> 39:45.135
for demanding it back with interest.

39:45.219 --> 39:46.552
How about family, Bart?

39:46.553 --> 39:48.847
How you fixed in that department?

39:48.931 --> 39:51.058
My folks live in Brooklyn
with my uncle.

39:51.141 --> 39:53.393
Mine have passed on.

39:53.435 --> 39:54.895
It's just us three now.

39:54.937 --> 39:56.396
What's that expression?

39:57.314 --> 39:58.899
Me, myself, and I.

39:58.941 --> 40:00.067
Sure.

40:00.150 --> 40:02.110
That's tough.

40:02.152 --> 40:03.904
But in a sense,

40:03.946 --> 40:07.282
we're all alone in the world,
aren't we, Charlie?

40:07.324 --> 40:10.285
I'm often surrounded
by family and friends,

40:10.369 --> 40:11.787
but...

40:14.623 --> 40:17.751
You're no stranger
to loneliness, then.

40:17.793 --> 40:19.753
I guess I got no beef,

40:19.795 --> 40:21.713
especially where the dames
are concerned.

40:21.797 --> 40:24.758
In my line of work,
I got opportunities galore.

40:24.800 --> 40:27.719
I could tell you stories
to curl your hair,

40:27.803 --> 40:30.264
but it looks like you've
already heard them.

40:30.305 --> 40:32.724
That's me in Kansas City
plying my trade.

40:32.808 --> 40:35.769
That was taken by
one of my policyholders.

40:35.811 --> 40:38.312
They're more than just customers
to me, Barton.

40:38.313 --> 40:40.274
They appreciate
what I have to offer.

40:40.315 --> 40:42.276
Her hubby was out of town,

40:42.317 --> 40:44.570
and they were carrying
fire and life.

40:44.653 --> 40:47.072
The third quarter payment
was way past due.

40:47.156 --> 40:49.074
In a way, I envy you...

40:49.158 --> 40:51.410
your daily routine,
you know what's expected.

40:51.493 --> 40:52.911
You know the drill.

40:54.997 --> 40:57.624
My job is to plumb the depths,

40:57.666 --> 40:59.000
so to speak.

40:59.001 --> 41:01.253
Dredge up something from inside,

41:01.336 --> 41:03.213
something honest.

41:03.297 --> 41:04.715
I got to tell you,

41:04.798 --> 41:06.341
the life of the mind...

41:06.425 --> 41:09.678
There's no road map
for that territory.

41:09.761 --> 41:12.598
And exploring it
can be painful.

41:13.932 --> 41:17.811
I have pain most people
don't know anything about.

41:19.688 --> 41:21.315
This must be boring you.

41:21.398 --> 41:23.734
Not at all.
It's damned interesting.

41:23.817 --> 41:25.235
Yeah.

41:25.319 --> 41:26.695
Probably sounds a little grand

41:26.778 --> 41:29.114
for someone who's writing
a wrestling picture

41:29.198 --> 41:30.364
for Wallace Beery.

41:30.365 --> 41:32.326
Beery?
You got no beef there.

41:32.367 --> 41:34.286
He's a hell of an actor,

41:34.369 --> 41:36.330
though you can't beatJack Oakie.

41:36.371 --> 41:37.831
A stitch, Oakie.

41:37.873 --> 41:39.333
Funny stuff, funny stuff.

41:39.374 --> 41:41.001
But don't get me wrong.

41:41.043 --> 41:43.337
Beery? Wrestling picture?
Could be a pip.

41:43.378 --> 41:45.005
Could be a pip.

41:45.047 --> 41:47.049
Wrestled myself some back in school.

41:47.090 --> 41:49.343
I guess you know the basic moves.

41:49.384 --> 41:50.844
No. I never watched any.

41:50.886 --> 41:52.930
I'm not interested in the act.

41:53.013 --> 41:55.307
Hell, you should know
what it's about.

41:55.390 --> 41:58.769
I can show you
the wrestling basics in 30 seconds.

41:58.852 --> 42:01.271
You're a little
out of your weight class,

42:01.355 --> 42:02.731
but just for demonstration purposes...

42:02.773 --> 42:03.898
That's all right.

42:03.899 --> 42:05.734
Not a bit of it, compadre.

42:05.818 --> 42:07.277
Easiest thing in the world.

42:07.361 --> 42:10.280
Just get on your knees
to my left here.

42:10.364 --> 42:13.242
Slap your right hand here,
your left hand here.

42:13.325 --> 42:16.286
Come on, champ.
You can do it. Come on.

42:16.370 --> 42:18.080
Come on.

42:19.039 --> 42:20.207
Come on.

42:20.290 --> 42:22.042
Come on.

42:23.210 --> 42:24.837
Yeah. There you go.

42:24.920 --> 42:26.463
Right there.

42:28.257 --> 42:29.466
All right.

42:29.550 --> 42:31.510
Now, when I say, "Ready, wrestle,"

42:31.593 --> 42:33.470
we try to pin each other.

42:33.554 --> 42:35.514
That's the whole game.
Got it?

42:35.597 --> 42:36.556
Yeah. Okay.

42:36.557 --> 42:37.765
Ready? Wrestle.

42:37.766 --> 42:38.725
Oh!

42:38.767 --> 42:40.018
1, 2, 3.

42:40.102 --> 42:42.020
Damn. There I go again.

42:42.104 --> 42:44.189
Going to wake up
the downstairs neighbors.

42:44.273 --> 42:46.233
I didn't hurt you, did I?

42:46.275 --> 42:47.234
It's okay.

42:47.276 --> 42:48.777
Well, that's all wrestling is.

42:48.819 --> 42:50.571
Usually there's
more grunting and squirming

42:50.612 --> 42:51.904
before the pin.

42:51.905 --> 42:54.408
Well, you're out of your weight class.

42:54.491 --> 42:56.952
Jesus, I did hurt you.

42:56.994 --> 42:58.286
I sure do apologize.

42:58.287 --> 43:00.414
I'm just a big, clumsy lug.

43:00.497 --> 43:02.332
I sure do apologize.

43:02.416 --> 43:04.001
You sure you're okay?

43:04.084 --> 43:05.961
I'm fine, really.

43:07.045 --> 43:08.714
Actually, it's been helpful.

43:11.967 --> 43:15.429
But I guess I should get to work.

43:15.512 --> 43:17.890
It wasn't fair of me to do that.

43:17.973 --> 43:19.892
I'm pretty well-endowed physically.

43:20.976 --> 43:22.311
Don't feel bad, though.

43:22.352 --> 43:25.314
I wouldn't be
much of a match for you

43:25.355 --> 43:26.648
at mental gymnastics.

43:26.690 --> 43:28.901
Give me a holler
you need anything.

44:03.268 --> 44:04.853
If I close my eyes,

44:04.937 --> 44:08.023
I can almost smell the live oak.

44:08.106 --> 44:11.568
That's chicken fat, Bill.

44:11.652 --> 44:14.738
Well, my olfactory's
turning womanish on me...

44:14.822 --> 44:16.323
lying and deceitful.

44:16.406 --> 44:19.993
Still, I must say I haven't
felt peace like this

44:20.077 --> 44:22.621
since the grand productive days.

44:22.704 --> 44:26.166
Don't you find it so, Barton?

44:26.208 --> 44:28.377
Ain't writing peace?

44:30.087 --> 44:31.380
Well...

44:33.382 --> 44:35.050
actually...

44:35.133 --> 44:36.468
no, Bill.

44:39.555 --> 44:41.849
No. I've always found

44:41.890 --> 44:45.018
that writing comes
from a great inner pain.

44:45.060 --> 44:48.105
Maybe it's a pain
that comes from a realization

44:48.188 --> 44:51.608
that one must do something
for one's fellow man

44:51.692 --> 44:54.945
to help somehow ease the suffering.

44:55.028 --> 44:57.948
Maybe it's personal pain.

44:58.031 --> 45:00.450
At any rate, I don't believe

45:00.534 --> 45:02.953
good work is possible without it.

45:03.036 --> 45:04.079
Hmm.

45:04.163 --> 45:08.750
Well, me, I just enjoy
making things up.

45:08.834 --> 45:11.211
Yes, sir. Escape.

45:12.337 --> 45:14.923
It's when I can't write
and escape myself,

45:15.007 --> 45:17.426
that I want to rip my head off

45:17.509 --> 45:19.428
and run screaming through the street

45:19.511 --> 45:22.472
with my balls
in a fruit picker's pail.

45:22.556 --> 45:23.432
Hmm.

45:23.515 --> 45:25.267
This will sometimes help.

45:25.350 --> 45:27.394
That doesn't help anything, Bill.

45:27.436 --> 45:29.813
I've never found that
to help my writing.

45:29.897 --> 45:31.648
Your writing?

45:31.732 --> 45:35.360
Son, have you ever heard
the story of Solomon's mammy?

45:35.444 --> 45:37.321
Barton, you should read this.

45:37.404 --> 45:38.822
I think it's Bill's finest,

45:38.906 --> 45:40.324
or among his finest, anyway.

45:40.407 --> 45:42.326
So now I'm supposed to roll over

45:42.409 --> 45:43.785
and get my belly scratched?

45:43.827 --> 45:44.786
Bill.

45:44.828 --> 45:46.037
Look, uh...

45:46.038 --> 45:47.956
maybe it's none of my business,

45:47.998 --> 45:50.959
but don't you think
a man with your talent...

45:51.001 --> 45:52.961
your first obligation
is to your gift?

45:53.003 --> 45:55.297
Shouldn't you be doing
whatever you have to

45:55.380 --> 45:56.672
to work again?

45:56.673 --> 45:58.258
What would that be?

45:58.342 --> 45:59.634
I don't know.

45:59.635 --> 46:00.968
But with that drink,

46:00.969 --> 46:03.138
you're cutting yourself
off from your gift

46:03.222 --> 46:04.515
and your fellow man

46:04.598 --> 46:06.517
and everything your art is about.

46:06.600 --> 46:07.935
Oh, no, son.

46:07.976 --> 46:09.728
I'm building a levee...

46:09.811 --> 46:12.439
gulp by gulp,
brick by brick...

46:12.481 --> 46:13.815
Putting up a levee

46:13.816 --> 46:16.109
to keep that raging river of manure

46:16.151 --> 46:17.653
from lapping at my door.

46:17.694 --> 46:19.154
Maybe you better, too, Barton,

46:19.196 --> 46:21.490
before you get buried
under his manure.

46:21.532 --> 46:23.742
My honey pretends
to be impatient with me,

46:23.826 --> 46:25.744
but she'll put up with anything.

46:25.828 --> 46:27.162
Not anything, Bill.

46:27.204 --> 46:28.497
Don't test me.

46:28.580 --> 46:32.501
You're lucky she puts up with you
as much as she does.

46:32.543 --> 46:34.002
Maybe to a schoolboy's eyes.

46:34.044 --> 46:36.505
People who know about
the human heart, though,

46:36.547 --> 46:38.507
maybe they'd say,
"Bill over here,

46:38.549 --> 46:40.008
he gives his honey love,

46:40.092 --> 46:42.344
and she pays him back with pity,

46:42.427 --> 46:43.846
the basest coin there is."

46:43.929 --> 46:45.931
Stop it, Bill.

46:46.056 --> 46:47.850
Gone are the days

46:47.933 --> 46:51.687
When my heart was young and gay

46:51.728 --> 46:54.815
Gone are my friends

46:54.898 --> 46:59.486
From the cotton fields away

46:59.528 --> 47:02.072
Gone from the earth

47:02.156 --> 47:05.409
To a better land I know

47:05.492 --> 47:08.078
I hear their gentle voices

47:09.163 --> 47:13.709
Callin'Old Black Joe

47:13.792 --> 47:15.544
I'm comin'

47:15.627 --> 47:18.046
I'm comin'

47:18.088 --> 47:22.384
Oh, my head is bending low

47:22.426 --> 47:26.013
I hear their gentle...

47:26.096 --> 47:29.057
The truth, my honey, is a tart

47:29.099 --> 47:32.060
that does not bear scrutiny.

47:32.102 --> 47:35.189
Breach my levee at your peril!

47:35.272 --> 47:38.734
Gone are my friends

47:38.817 --> 47:40.569
From the cotton fields...

47:40.652 --> 47:42.571
That son of a bitch!

47:42.613 --> 47:45.073
Don't get me wrong.
He's a fine writer.

47:45.115 --> 47:48.076
Gone from the earth

47:48.160 --> 47:49.452
Are you all right?

47:49.453 --> 47:51.413
To a better life I know

47:51.455 --> 47:53.415
Audrey, y-you can't...

47:53.457 --> 47:54.917
Oh, Barton.

47:54.958 --> 47:57.252
You can't put up with that.

47:57.294 --> 47:59.880
Old Black Joe

47:59.963 --> 48:02.174
I feel so sorry for him.

48:02.257 --> 48:05.177
What? He's... He's a son of a bitch.

48:05.260 --> 48:07.012
No.

48:07.095 --> 48:08.514
No.

48:09.765 --> 48:11.225
He...

48:11.266 --> 48:13.310
He sometimes just...

48:13.393 --> 48:16.021
I hear their angel voices...

48:16.104 --> 48:18.690
Well, he thinks about Estelle.

48:18.774 --> 48:21.527
His wife still lives
in Fayettesville.

48:22.444 --> 48:23.862
She's...

48:26.782 --> 48:28.367
disturbed.

48:28.450 --> 48:30.202
Really?

48:31.954 --> 48:35.207
I'll just walk on down
to the Pacific,

48:35.290 --> 48:37.543
and from there I'll improvise.

48:37.626 --> 48:39.753
He'll wander back
when he's sober

48:39.795 --> 48:40.962
and apologize.

48:40.963 --> 48:42.256
He always does.

48:42.297 --> 48:44.216
Okay, but that doesn't excuse his...

48:44.299 --> 48:45.551
Silence upon the hill...

48:45.634 --> 48:46.593
behavior.

48:46.635 --> 48:47.594
In Darien!

48:47.636 --> 48:50.097
Empathy requires understanding.

48:50.138 --> 48:51.390
I'm comin'

48:51.473 --> 48:52.558
What?

48:52.641 --> 48:54.101
What don't I understand?

48:54.142 --> 48:55.060
I'm comin'

48:55.143 --> 48:59.898
Oh, my head is hangin'low

48:59.982 --> 49:03.152
I hear their gentle voices

49:03.235 --> 49:08.240
Callin'Old Black Joe

50:33.575 --> 50:36.078
I hope these are your shoes.

50:36.119 --> 50:37.538
Charlie.

50:37.579 --> 50:39.540
Because that would mean...

50:39.581 --> 50:40.874
they gave you mine.

50:40.916 --> 50:42.042
Yeah.

50:42.084 --> 50:45.045
As a matter of fact, they did.

50:45.087 --> 50:46.922
Come on in.

50:46.964 --> 50:48.882
Jesus, what a day I had.

50:50.592 --> 50:53.053
Ever have one of those days?

50:53.095 --> 50:54.721
Seems like nothing but lately.

50:54.805 --> 50:56.223
Jesus, what a day.

50:56.265 --> 51:00.060
Felt like I couldn't have sold
ice water in the Sahara.

51:00.102 --> 51:02.020
Okay. So you don't want insurance.

51:02.104 --> 51:03.647
Okay. So that's your loss.

51:03.730 --> 51:05.816
But, God, people can be rude.

51:05.899 --> 51:08.026
I feel like I have to talk

51:08.110 --> 51:09.987
to a normal person like you

51:10.070 --> 51:12.322
just to restore a little of my...

51:12.406 --> 51:13.824
It's my pleasure.

51:13.907 --> 51:16.368
I could use a little lift myself.

51:16.451 --> 51:18.162
A little lift? Yeah.

51:18.245 --> 51:20.998
Good thing they bottle it, huh, pal?

51:21.915 --> 51:23.333
Did I say rude?

51:23.417 --> 51:26.170
People can be goddamn cruel,

51:26.253 --> 51:28.380
especially some of these housewives.

51:28.463 --> 51:29.339
Okay.

51:29.423 --> 51:31.508
So I have a weight problem.

51:31.592 --> 51:33.177
That's my cross to bear.

51:33.260 --> 51:34.887
I don't know.

51:34.970 --> 51:36.346
It's a defense mechanism.

51:36.430 --> 51:37.848
Defense against what, insurance?

51:37.931 --> 51:39.223
Something they need?

51:39.224 --> 51:42.186
Something they should be
grateful to me for offering?

51:42.269 --> 51:44.021
A little peace of mind.

51:46.940 --> 51:49.359
Finally decided
to knock off early.

51:49.443 --> 51:51.695
Went to see a doctor about this.

51:51.778 --> 51:54.239
He told me I had an ear infection.

51:54.323 --> 51:55.615
$10, please.

51:55.616 --> 51:59.036
I says, "Hell, I told you
my ear was infected.

51:59.119 --> 52:01.038
Why don't you give me $10?"

52:01.121 --> 52:03.624
Well, that led to an argument.

52:07.586 --> 52:09.505
Listen to me bellyaching,

52:09.546 --> 52:13.133
as if my problems amounted
to a hill of beans.

52:13.217 --> 52:15.969
How goes the life of the mind?

52:16.053 --> 52:18.138
Well, it's been better.

52:18.222 --> 52:21.183
I can't seem to get going
on this thing.

52:21.266 --> 52:22.558
That one idea,

52:22.559 --> 52:24.853
the one that lets you get started,

52:24.937 --> 52:26.355
I still haven't gotten it.

52:26.438 --> 52:28.857
Maybe I only had one idea in me...

52:28.941 --> 52:29.858
my play.

52:29.900 --> 52:31.360
Maybe once that was done,

52:31.443 --> 52:33.362
I was done being a writer.

52:33.445 --> 52:35.531
Christ, I feel like a fraud,

52:35.614 --> 52:38.158
sitting here staring at this paper.

52:38.200 --> 52:42.663
Those two lovebirds next door
driving you nuts?

52:44.540 --> 52:46.542
How do you know about that?

52:46.583 --> 52:47.875
Know about it?

52:47.876 --> 52:50.337
I can practically see
how they're doing it.

52:50.420 --> 52:53.340
Brother, I wish I had
a piece of that.

52:53.382 --> 52:54.883
Seems like I hear everything

52:54.925 --> 52:56.844
that goes on in this dump...

52:56.885 --> 52:58.262
the pipes or something.

52:58.345 --> 52:59.512
Yeah, but...

52:59.513 --> 53:00.973
You'll lick this picture business.

53:01.056 --> 53:03.183
You got a head on your shoulders.

53:03.267 --> 53:04.600
What do they say?

53:04.601 --> 53:06.228
Where there's a head, there's hope.

53:06.311 --> 53:07.729
Where there's life, there's hope.

53:07.813 --> 53:10.357
See, that proves
you really are a writer.

53:10.399 --> 53:12.401
There's hope for you, too, Charlie.

53:12.442 --> 53:15.404
Tomorrow I bet you sell
a half-dozen policies.

53:15.445 --> 53:17.406
Thanks, brother, but the fact is

53:17.447 --> 53:20.200
I got to pull up stakes for a while.

53:24.413 --> 53:25.705
You're leaving?

53:25.706 --> 53:27.039
In a few days.

53:27.040 --> 53:29.418
Out to your stomping grounds...
New York City.

53:29.501 --> 53:32.421
Things got all balled up
at the head office.

53:34.131 --> 53:37.092
I'm truly sorry to hear that.
I'll miss you.

53:37.134 --> 53:39.553
Well, hell, buddy.
Don't pull a long face.

53:39.595 --> 53:41.388
I keep a room here,

53:41.430 --> 53:43.891
and I'll be back sooner or later.

53:43.932 --> 53:45.184
And mark my words,

53:45.267 --> 53:47.186
by the time I get back,

53:47.269 --> 53:48.687
your picture will be finished.

53:48.770 --> 53:51.190
New York can be
pretty cruel to strangers.

53:51.273 --> 53:53.358
If you need a home-cooked meal,

53:53.442 --> 53:56.361
you just look up
Sam and Lillian Fink.

53:56.445 --> 53:58.697
They live on Fulton Street...

53:59.615 --> 54:01.200
with my uncle Maury.

54:11.835 --> 54:14.296
Christ.

54:14.338 --> 54:17.299
Your room does that, too.

54:17.382 --> 54:20.636
I guess the heat's
sweating off the wallpaper.

54:21.887 --> 54:23.305
What a dump.

54:23.347 --> 54:26.308
I guess this must seem pretty pathetic

54:26.391 --> 54:28.310
to a guy like you.

54:28.352 --> 54:29.812
Well...

54:29.853 --> 54:32.815
But it's pathetic, isn't it?

54:32.898 --> 54:35.818
I mean, to a guy from New York?

54:35.859 --> 54:38.153
What do you mean?

54:38.237 --> 54:39.655
This kind of heat.

54:39.738 --> 54:41.156
It's pathetic.

54:41.198 --> 54:43.826
Well, I guess
you pick your poison.

54:43.909 --> 54:45.828
So they say.

54:45.869 --> 54:48.831
Don't pick up and leave
without saying good-bye.

54:48.872 --> 54:50.833
'Course not, compadre.

54:50.916 --> 54:52.960
You'll see me again.

56:11.872 --> 56:12.872
Zing! Bango!

56:12.873 --> 56:14.249
You're dead.
You're a corpse.

56:14.333 --> 56:15.666
You got me.

56:15.667 --> 56:18.253
Okay, go, go, you son of a gun.

56:18.337 --> 56:19.755
Yeah, Fink.

56:22.841 --> 56:24.259
Come on, come on.

56:25.844 --> 56:28.388
What do you got for me?

56:28.472 --> 56:30.224
What the hell happened to your face?

56:30.265 --> 56:32.434
Nothing.
It's just a mosquito bite.

56:32.518 --> 56:34.770
There are no mosquitoes
in Los Angeles.

56:34.853 --> 56:36.772
Mosquitoes breed in swamps.
This is a desert.

56:36.855 --> 56:38.315
What do you got for me?

56:38.398 --> 56:39.441
Well, I...

56:39.525 --> 56:41.819
On the Beery picture, where are we?

56:41.902 --> 56:44.237
Well, I'm having a little trouble
getting started.

56:44.238 --> 56:45.781
Getting start...
ChristJesus, started?

56:45.864 --> 56:47.407
You don't have anything yet?

56:47.491 --> 56:48.784
Well, not much.

56:48.867 --> 56:51.286
What the hell do you
think this is, Hamlet,

56:51.370 --> 56:53.288
Gone With the Wind,
Ruggles of Red Gap?

56:53.372 --> 56:55.123
It's a goddamn B picture...

56:55.207 --> 56:56.959
big men in tights...
you know the drill.

56:57.042 --> 56:58.836
I don't really understand that genre.

56:58.919 --> 57:00.712
Maybe that's the problem.

57:00.796 --> 57:02.046
Understand? Shit!

57:02.047 --> 57:04.006
You were going to consult
another writer on this.

57:04.007 --> 57:05.634
Well, I've talked to Bill Mayhew.

57:05.717 --> 57:08.220
Mayhew? Some help.
The guy's a souse.

57:08.303 --> 57:09.512
He's a great writer.

57:09.513 --> 57:10.638
A great souse!

57:10.639 --> 57:13.267
He's in pain
because he can't write.

57:13.350 --> 57:14.475
Souse! Souse!

57:14.476 --> 57:15.978
He manages to write his name

57:16.019 --> 57:18.272
on the back
of his paycheck every week.

57:18.313 --> 57:20.732
I thought no one cared
about this picture.

57:20.816 --> 57:21.983
You thought?

57:21.984 --> 57:24.778
I don't know
what the hell you said to Lipnick,

57:24.862 --> 57:27.322
but the son of a bitch likes you.

57:27.364 --> 57:30.284
He's taken a interest.

57:30.325 --> 57:32.828
Never make Lipnick like you.

57:32.870 --> 57:33.829
Never!

57:33.871 --> 57:35.163
I... I don't understand.

57:35.164 --> 57:37.499
Are you deaf?
He likes you.

57:37.583 --> 57:40.002
What the hell did you say to him?

57:40.085 --> 57:41.003
Nothing.

57:41.044 --> 57:42.796
Well, he's taken a interest.

57:42.838 --> 57:45.299
He'll make your life hell.

57:45.340 --> 57:46.842
Since I drew the short straw

57:46.884 --> 57:48.302
to supervise this turkey,

57:48.343 --> 57:50.345
he'll be all over me, too.

57:50.387 --> 57:52.431
Fat-ass son of a bitch called yesterday

57:52.514 --> 57:54.308
to ask how it's going.

57:54.349 --> 57:56.810
I said you were making progress.

57:56.852 --> 57:58.312
We were all very excited.

57:58.353 --> 58:01.023
I told him it was great.

58:01.106 --> 58:02.148
Understand that?

58:02.149 --> 58:04.234
Now my ass is on the line.

58:04.318 --> 58:07.279
He wants you to tell him
all about it tomorrow.

58:07.362 --> 58:09.198
I can't write anything by tomorrow.

58:09.281 --> 58:11.742
Who said write?
Jesus, Jack can't read.

58:11.825 --> 58:13.744
You got to tell it to him.

58:13.827 --> 58:16.788
Tell him something,
for Christ's sake.

58:16.872 --> 58:19.374
Well, what do I t-tell him?

58:25.339 --> 58:26.757
Yes, Mr. Geezler.

58:26.840 --> 58:28.300
Projection!

58:28.383 --> 58:29.259
Jerry.

58:29.343 --> 58:30.761
Jerry, Ben Geisler here.

58:30.844 --> 58:32.262
Any screening rooms free?

58:32.346 --> 58:34.306
Good! Book it for me.

58:34.389 --> 58:36.266
I got a writer here.
He's coming in.

58:36.350 --> 58:38.435
You're going to show him
wrestling pictures.

58:38.519 --> 58:40.229
I don't give a shit which ones!

58:40.312 --> 58:43.315
Isn't Victor Sjoderberg
shooting one now?

58:43.398 --> 58:44.817
Show him some dailies on that.

58:44.900 --> 58:45.984
Okay, Ben.

58:46.068 --> 58:47.277
All right.

58:47.361 --> 58:49.279
This will give you some ideas.

58:49.363 --> 58:53.200
8:15 tomorrow morning
at Lipnick's house.

58:56.036 --> 58:58.247
Ideas.

58:58.330 --> 58:59.748
Broad strokes.

59:01.583 --> 59:04.795
Don't cross me, Fink.

59:06.171 --> 59:08.090
Devil on the Can...

59:08.173 --> 59:10.759
Devil on the Canvas,
12 Apple, take 1.

59:10.843 --> 59:12.094
Action!

59:12.177 --> 59:13.720
I will destroy him!

59:13.762 --> 59:15.389
Cut! Cut! Cut! Cut!

59:15.430 --> 59:18.350
Devil on the Canvas,
12 Apple, take 2.

59:18.433 --> 59:19.852
Action!

59:19.935 --> 59:21.562
I will destroy him!

59:21.645 --> 59:23.021
Cut! Cut!

59:24.106 --> 59:25.149
Rolling!

59:25.232 --> 59:27.776
Devil on the Canvas,
12 Apple, take 4.

59:27.860 --> 59:28.777
Action!

59:28.861 --> 59:31.321
I will destroy him!

59:31.405 --> 59:32.739
Cut! Cut! Cut!

59:32.781 --> 59:35.117
Devil on the Canvas,
12 Apple, take 5.

59:35.200 --> 59:37.452
I will destroy him!

59:37.536 --> 59:39.121
12 Apple, take 6.

59:39.204 --> 59:40.789
I will destroy him!

59:40.873 --> 59:42.958
12 Apple, take 7.

59:43.041 --> 59:44.793
I will destroy him!

59:44.877 --> 59:46.210
12 Baker, take 1.

59:46.211 --> 59:50.007
I will destroy him!

59:50.090 --> 59:51.800
Aah!

59:53.427 --> 59:56.138
Aah!

59:56.221 --> 59:57.931
Aah!

59:58.015 --> 59:58.974
Aah!

59:59.057 --> 01:00:00.851
12 Charlie, take 1.

01:00:00.934 --> 01:00:02.352
- Aah!
- Aah!

01:00:02.436 --> 01:00:04.188
- Aah!
- Aah!

01:00:04.271 --> 01:00:05.355
Take 2.

01:00:05.439 --> 01:00:07.941
- Aah!
- Aah!

01:00:08.025 --> 01:00:10.194
2...

01:00:10.277 --> 01:00:11.403
Take 7.

01:00:11.487 --> 01:00:13.822
- Aah!
- Aah!

01:00:13.864 --> 01:00:15.449
2...

01:00:15.532 --> 01:00:17.951
- Aah!
- Aah!

01:00:17.993 --> 01:00:19.495
- Aah!
- Aah!

01:00:19.578 --> 01:00:21.079
- Aah!
- Aah!

01:00:21.163 --> 01:00:23.415
- Aah!
- Aah!

01:00:23.499 --> 01:00:25.959
Aah!

01:00:48.357 --> 01:00:49.983
Orphan.

01:00:50.025 --> 01:00:51.318
Dame.

01:00:53.570 --> 01:00:54.822
Front desk.

01:00:54.905 --> 01:00:56.323
Hello, Chet?

01:00:56.365 --> 01:00:58.283
This is Barton Fink in room 621.

01:00:58.367 --> 01:01:00.327
Could you try a number for me
in Hollywood?

01:01:00.369 --> 01:01:03.372
Slauson 6-4304.

01:01:03.413 --> 01:01:04.998
Right away, sir.

01:01:07.334 --> 01:01:08.794
Pick it up.
Pick it up.

01:01:08.877 --> 01:01:09.795
Hello.

01:01:09.878 --> 01:01:11.296
Audrey, I need help.

01:01:11.380 --> 01:01:13.757
I know I shouldn't be
calling you like this.

01:01:13.841 --> 01:01:16.384
I wouldn't have
if I could see any alternative.

01:01:16.385 --> 01:01:18.762
I'm sorry.
Listen, how are you?

01:01:18.846 --> 01:01:20.305
You doing okay?

01:01:20.389 --> 01:01:21.765
Who is this?

01:01:21.849 --> 01:01:24.268
Barton! I'm sorry.
It's Barton Fink.

01:01:24.351 --> 01:01:27.271
Barton, I'm afraid
it's not a good time.

01:01:27.354 --> 01:01:29.815
I'm sorry.
I just feel like I need...

01:01:29.898 --> 01:01:31.775
I know I shouldn't ask.

01:01:31.859 --> 01:01:34.820
I just need some kind of help.

01:01:34.903 --> 01:01:37.322
I have a deadline tomorrow.

01:01:37.406 --> 01:01:38.782
All right, Barton.

01:01:38.866 --> 01:01:40.826
I'll see if I can slip away.

01:01:40.909 --> 01:01:42.286
Oh, if you could...

01:01:42.369 --> 01:01:44.329
If I can.

01:01:44.413 --> 01:01:46.331
He... He gets jealous.

01:01:46.415 --> 01:01:47.791
I need help, Audrey.

01:01:49.418 --> 01:01:50.794
I'll try to slip out

01:01:50.878 --> 01:01:54.298
if he quiets down, passes out.

01:01:54.381 --> 01:01:56.758
I'm afraid he thinks...

01:01:56.842 --> 01:01:59.803
Well, he said you were
a buffoon, Barton.

01:01:59.887 --> 01:02:00.846
Uh-huh.

01:02:00.929 --> 01:02:02.347
He becomes irrational.

01:02:03.724 --> 01:02:04.765
Uh-huh, uh-huh.

01:02:04.766 --> 01:02:06.226
I'll try and slip away.

01:02:06.268 --> 01:02:08.061
Who is that?

01:02:25.329 --> 01:02:28.290
Audrey, thank you for coming.

01:02:28.373 --> 01:02:29.291
Thank you.

01:02:29.374 --> 01:02:30.374
Hello, Barton.

01:02:30.375 --> 01:02:32.294
I'm sorry to be...

01:02:32.377 --> 01:02:34.922
such a... such a...

01:02:36.381 --> 01:02:37.299
Thank you.

01:02:37.341 --> 01:02:40.093
That's all right, Barton.

01:02:40.177 --> 01:02:42.638
Everything's going to be all right.

01:02:42.721 --> 01:02:44.640
Yes. Thank you.

01:02:44.765 --> 01:02:45.933
Thank you.

01:02:46.016 --> 01:02:48.477
Yes. Thank you.

01:02:50.354 --> 01:02:51.772
How's Bill?

01:02:51.814 --> 01:02:54.817
Oh, he's, uh...

01:02:54.858 --> 01:02:56.318
He drifted off.

01:02:56.360 --> 01:02:58.946
He'll sleep for a while now.

01:03:00.364 --> 01:03:03.033
What is it you have to do exactly?

01:03:03.116 --> 01:03:07.287
Well, I have to come up
with an outline,

01:03:07.329 --> 01:03:09.248
I guess you call it,

01:03:09.331 --> 01:03:12.251
the whole goddamn story,
soup to nuts, three acts,

01:03:12.334 --> 01:03:14.169
the whole goddamn...

01:03:14.253 --> 01:03:15.587
That's all right, Barton.

01:03:15.671 --> 01:03:17.965
You don't have to write
actual scenes.

01:03:18.006 --> 01:03:21.927
No, but the whole goddamn...

01:03:23.345 --> 01:03:25.264
Audrey...

01:03:25.347 --> 01:03:28.600
have you ever read
any of Bill's wrestling scenarios?

01:03:28.684 --> 01:03:31.353
Yes, I'm afraid I have.

01:03:31.436 --> 01:03:34.940
What are they like?
What are they about?

01:03:35.023 --> 01:03:36.775
Well...

01:03:36.859 --> 01:03:40.654
usually they're simple morality tales.

01:03:40.696 --> 01:03:44.283
There's a good wrestler
and a bad wrestler,

01:03:44.366 --> 01:03:46.410
whom he confronts at the end.

01:03:46.493 --> 01:03:48.870
In between, the good wrestler
has a love interest

01:03:48.871 --> 01:03:51.790
or a small child he has to protect.

01:03:51.874 --> 01:03:53.625
Bill would usually make
the good wrestler

01:03:53.709 --> 01:03:56.086
a backwards type or a convict,

01:03:56.170 --> 01:03:59.548
and sometimes, instead of a waif,

01:03:59.631 --> 01:04:03.343
he'd have the wrestler
protecting an idiot man-child.

01:04:03.385 --> 01:04:06.388
The studio always hated that.

01:04:06.471 --> 01:04:09.057
Some of the scripts were so...

01:04:09.141 --> 01:04:10.392
spirited.

01:04:14.605 --> 01:04:18.775
Barton, look,
it's really just a formula.

01:04:18.859 --> 01:04:21.236
You don't have to type
your soul into it.

01:04:21.320 --> 01:04:23.614
We'll invent some names
and a new setting.

01:04:23.697 --> 01:04:25.741
I'll help you.
It won't take any time at all.

01:04:25.824 --> 01:04:28.243
I did it for Bill so many times.

01:04:28.327 --> 01:04:30.245
You did what for Bill?

01:04:30.287 --> 01:04:33.248
Well... this.

01:04:33.332 --> 01:04:36.543
You wrote his scripts for him?

01:04:39.338 --> 01:04:43.592
Well, the basic ideas
were frequently his.

01:04:43.675 --> 01:04:47.262
You wrote Bill's scripts?

01:04:47.346 --> 01:04:49.097
Jesus, you wrote his...

01:04:49.181 --> 01:04:50.974
Well, what about before that?

01:04:51.058 --> 01:04:52.016
Before what?

01:04:52.017 --> 01:04:54.770
Before Bill came to Hollywood.

01:04:54.853 --> 01:04:57.773
Bill was always the author,
so to speak.

01:04:57.856 --> 01:05:00.901
What do you mean, "so to speak"?

01:05:00.984 --> 01:05:04.947
Audrey, how long have you been his...

01:05:04.988 --> 01:05:06.281
secretary?

01:05:06.365 --> 01:05:09.117
Let's concentrate
on our little project.

01:05:09.201 --> 01:05:11.744
I want to know how many
of Bill's books you wrote!

01:05:11.745 --> 01:05:12.995
I want to know!

01:05:12.996 --> 01:05:15.082
Barton, honestly...

01:05:17.918 --> 01:05:19.878
Only the last couple.

01:05:19.962 --> 01:05:21.088
Hah!

01:05:21.129 --> 01:05:25.384
And my input was
mostly editorial, really,

01:05:25.467 --> 01:05:27.177
after he had been drinking.

01:05:27.261 --> 01:05:28.387
I'll bet.

01:05:28.470 --> 01:05:32.349
Jesus, "the grand productive days"!

01:05:32.432 --> 01:05:34.685
What a goddamn phony.

01:05:34.768 --> 01:05:36.353
W.P. Mayhew...

01:05:36.436 --> 01:05:39.106
William goddamn Phony Mayhew!

01:05:39.148 --> 01:05:40.983
All his guff about escape!

01:05:41.066 --> 01:05:44.027
I'll say he escaped!

01:05:45.946 --> 01:05:47.781
We don't have much time.

01:05:51.994 --> 01:05:54.371
It'll be fine.

01:05:54.454 --> 01:05:57.708
Don't judge him, Barton.

01:05:59.001 --> 01:06:02.379
Don't condescend to him.

01:06:02.462 --> 01:06:06.842
I help Bill most
by understanding him,

01:06:06.925 --> 01:06:08.969
by appreciating him.

01:06:10.888 --> 01:06:14.349
We all need understanding, Barton...

01:06:14.391 --> 01:06:17.311
even you tonight.

01:06:17.352 --> 01:06:19.855
It's all you really need.

01:09:30.337 --> 01:09:32.171
Aah!

01:09:32.214 --> 01:09:34.006
Aah!

01:09:34.091 --> 01:09:35.425
Aah!

01:09:43.225 --> 01:09:44.143
Barton?

01:09:56.989 --> 01:09:58.657
Barton, are you all right?

01:09:58.740 --> 01:09:59.740
I'm fine, thanks.

01:09:59.741 --> 01:10:00.659
You sure?

01:10:00.742 --> 01:10:01.827
No! No.

01:12:15.419 --> 01:12:17.588
Barton. Are you all right?

01:12:17.671 --> 01:12:19.631
No. Can I come in?

01:12:19.715 --> 01:12:21.592
Let's go to your room.

01:12:21.675 --> 01:12:24.595
Charlie, I'm in trouble.
You got to help me.

01:12:24.678 --> 01:12:26.597
Get a grip on yourself, brother.

01:12:26.680 --> 01:12:29.600
Whatever the problem is,
we can sort it out.

01:12:29.683 --> 01:12:32.185
Charlie, I'm in trouble.
Something horrible's happened.

01:12:32.186 --> 01:12:34.104
I got to call the police.

01:12:34.188 --> 01:12:37.107
Will you stay with me
till they get here?

01:12:37.191 --> 01:12:40.235
Don't worry about it.
We can work it out.

01:12:40.319 --> 01:12:42.613
Before you go in...
I didn't do this.

01:12:42.696 --> 01:12:45.616
I don't know how it happened, but...

01:12:45.699 --> 01:12:46.992
I didn't.

01:12:47.075 --> 01:12:49.286
I want you to know that.

01:12:56.084 --> 01:12:57.127
Okay.

01:13:03.634 --> 01:13:04.718
Ohhh!

01:13:09.807 --> 01:13:10.766
Oh...

01:13:18.774 --> 01:13:19.858
Oh...

01:13:24.321 --> 01:13:26.782
Jesus, Barton,
what the hell is this?

01:13:26.824 --> 01:13:28.325
What are we going to do?

01:13:28.408 --> 01:13:29.408
Call the police.

01:13:29.409 --> 01:13:30.452
Hold on.

01:13:30.536 --> 01:13:31.870
I didn't do this.

01:13:31.954 --> 01:13:33.455
I did not do this!

01:13:33.539 --> 01:13:34.414
Hold on!

01:13:34.498 --> 01:13:35.582
Stop.

01:13:35.624 --> 01:13:38.168
Take a deep breath.
Tell me what happened.

01:13:38.252 --> 01:13:41.046
I passed out! I don't know!
Won't the police...

01:13:41.129 --> 01:13:43.173
Stop with the police!
Wake up!

01:13:43.257 --> 01:13:45.467
This looks bad!
They hang people for this!

01:13:45.551 --> 01:13:48.554
But I didn't do it.
Don't you believe me?

01:13:48.637 --> 01:13:51.890
I believe you! I know you!
Why should the police?

01:13:53.809 --> 01:13:54.852
Did you...

01:13:56.103 --> 01:13:58.021
Barton, between you and me,

01:13:58.105 --> 01:14:00.274
did you have sexual intercourse?

01:14:03.110 --> 01:14:04.945
Jesus, they can tell that.

01:14:05.028 --> 01:14:08.115
Got to believe me!

01:14:08.198 --> 01:14:10.659
They got to have mercy!

01:14:10.701 --> 01:14:12.161
You're in pictures, Barton.

01:14:12.202 --> 01:14:14.580
Even if they cleared you eventually,

01:14:14.663 --> 01:14:16.165
this would ruin you.

01:14:18.750 --> 01:14:19.668
Come on.

01:14:19.751 --> 01:14:21.295
Wait in the bathroom.

01:14:43.901 --> 01:14:48.030
Oh, Lord.
Oh, Lordy. Oh, my Lord.

01:14:48.113 --> 01:14:51.033
Oh, my Lord.

01:14:52.868 --> 01:14:53.952
Ooh!

01:15:05.923 --> 01:15:07.716
You passed out.

01:15:09.801 --> 01:15:10.968
Where's Audrey?

01:15:10.969 --> 01:15:12.387
She's dead, Barton!

01:15:12.471 --> 01:15:15.015
She's dead, if that was her name!

01:15:15.098 --> 01:15:18.227
You got to act
as if nothing has happened.

01:15:18.310 --> 01:15:20.729
Put this totally out of your head.

01:15:20.813 --> 01:15:24.066
Your play is to go about
your business as usual.

01:15:24.149 --> 01:15:27.361
Give us some time
to sort this out.

01:15:36.703 --> 01:15:39.414
Bart!
So happy to see ya!

01:15:40.499 --> 01:15:42.793
Sit. Talk.
Relax for a minute.

01:15:42.876 --> 01:15:44.294
Then talk.

01:15:44.378 --> 01:15:45.462
Drink?

01:15:45.546 --> 01:15:47.089
Uh...

01:15:47.172 --> 01:15:48.298
yeah.

01:15:49.758 --> 01:15:50.758
Rye whiskey?

01:15:50.759 --> 01:15:53.095
Boy, you writers.
Work hard, play hard.

01:15:53.178 --> 01:15:55.055
That's what I hear, anyway.
Lou!

01:15:55.097 --> 01:15:59.476
Anyway, Ben Geisler tells me things
are going along great.

01:15:59.560 --> 01:16:01.937
Says we got a real winner
in this one.

01:16:02.020 --> 01:16:04.439
I'll tell you something.
I'm counting on it.

01:16:04.523 --> 01:16:07.234
I've taken an interest.
Nothing to fear, mind you.

01:16:07.317 --> 01:16:09.236
Hardly seems necessary in your case...

01:16:09.278 --> 01:16:11.738
a writer,
a storyteller of your stature.

01:16:11.780 --> 01:16:14.241
Give it to me
in bold strokes, Bart.

01:16:14.283 --> 01:16:15.909
Give me the broad outlines.

01:16:15.951 --> 01:16:18.453
I'm in the audience,
the lights go down,

01:16:18.495 --> 01:16:19.913
Capitol logo comes up.

01:16:19.955 --> 01:16:21.874
You're on, huh?

01:16:25.627 --> 01:16:26.920
Yeah.

01:16:26.962 --> 01:16:28.630
Uh... okay.

01:16:28.797 --> 01:16:29.923
Huh?

01:16:31.633 --> 01:16:33.093
Well, uh...

01:16:34.261 --> 01:16:35.637
we... we fade in...

01:16:35.721 --> 01:16:37.264
Uh-huh.

01:16:39.183 --> 01:16:42.269
It's... It's a tenement building
on the Lower East Side.

01:16:42.352 --> 01:16:44.313
Great!
He's poor, this wrestler.

01:16:44.354 --> 01:16:45.939
He's had to struggle, huh?

01:16:47.941 --> 01:16:49.192
And then...

01:16:49.193 --> 01:16:50.277
Uh-huh?

01:16:50.360 --> 01:16:52.029
Well, uh...

01:16:54.656 --> 01:16:56.783
Can I be honest, Mr. Lipnick?

01:16:56.825 --> 01:16:59.786
Can you?
Jesus, you damn well better be!

01:16:59.828 --> 01:17:02.206
If I wasn't honest
in my business dealings...

01:17:02.289 --> 01:17:04.208
Well, you can't always be honest,

01:17:04.291 --> 01:17:06.627
not with the sharks
swimming around this town.

01:17:06.710 --> 01:17:08.170
If I'd been totally honest,

01:17:08.212 --> 01:17:10.172
I wouldn't be near this pool

01:17:10.255 --> 01:17:11.673
unless I was cleaning it.

01:17:11.757 --> 01:17:14.593
But that's no reason
for you not to be.

01:17:14.676 --> 01:17:17.012
Honest, I mean.
Not cleaning the pool.

01:17:20.057 --> 01:17:21.141
Oh.

01:17:22.893 --> 01:17:23.977
Uh-huh.

01:17:30.734 --> 01:17:32.694
To be honest, uh...

01:17:32.736 --> 01:17:34.196
I'm never really comfortable

01:17:34.238 --> 01:17:36.240
discussing work in progress.

01:17:36.323 --> 01:17:39.159
I got it all worked out in my head,

01:17:39.243 --> 01:17:42.788
but sometimes,
if you force it into words...

01:17:42.871 --> 01:17:44.873
prematurely...

01:17:44.957 --> 01:17:46.375
uh, the wrong words...

01:17:46.416 --> 01:17:47.876
Well, your meaning changes,

01:17:47.918 --> 01:17:52.172
and it changes in your own mind,
and you never get it back,

01:17:52.256 --> 01:17:56.135
so I'd... I'd just as soon
not talk about it.

01:18:01.265 --> 01:18:03.225
Mr. Fink... never mind me.

01:18:03.308 --> 01:18:05.644
Never mind how long
I've been in pictures.

01:18:05.727 --> 01:18:07.312
Mr. Lipnick's been in pictures

01:18:07.396 --> 01:18:09.189
about since they was invented.

01:18:09.231 --> 01:18:10.649
He practically invented them.

01:18:10.732 --> 01:18:12.276
I think if he's interested

01:18:12.359 --> 01:18:15.154
in what one of
his contract employees is doing,

01:18:15.237 --> 01:18:18.073
that employee
should be able to tell him

01:18:18.157 --> 01:18:21.702
if he wants to stay an employee.

01:18:21.743 --> 01:18:24.705
Right now,
the contents of your head

01:18:24.746 --> 01:18:27.374
are the property
of Capitol Pictures.

01:18:28.584 --> 01:18:30.169
If I was you...

01:18:30.252 --> 01:18:31.670
I would speak up.

01:18:31.753 --> 01:18:33.839
And pretty goddamn fast.

01:18:37.259 --> 01:18:43.724
You lousy kike...
son of a bitch.

01:18:43.765 --> 01:18:46.059
You're telling this man...
this artist...

01:18:46.101 --> 01:18:47.603
what to do?

01:18:47.644 --> 01:18:49.021
Mr. Lipnick, I...

01:18:49.104 --> 01:18:50.647
He creates for a living!

01:18:50.731 --> 01:18:53.775
Thank him, you son of a bitch,
or you're fired!

01:18:53.859 --> 01:18:56.278
Mr. Lipnick,
that's really not necessary.

01:18:56.361 --> 01:18:59.072
Get down on your knees,
you son of a bitch!

01:18:59.156 --> 01:19:00.490
Kiss this man's feet!

01:19:00.491 --> 01:19:02.576
Mr. Lipnick, please.

01:19:02.659 --> 01:19:04.036
Kiss this man's feet!

01:19:09.625 --> 01:19:11.919
Get out of here!
You understand me?

01:19:11.960 --> 01:19:16.548
You're out of here. You're fired.
Get out of my sight.

01:19:24.056 --> 01:19:25.015
I...

01:19:25.098 --> 01:19:26.265
I apologize, Barton.

01:19:26.266 --> 01:19:28.727
No. Mr. Breeze actually
has been a great help.

01:19:28.811 --> 01:19:32.314
You don't have to cover for him.
That's very noble.

01:19:32.397 --> 01:19:34.900
I'd feel much better
if you'd just reconsider.

01:19:34.983 --> 01:19:37.736
If that son of a bitch
won't apologize to you,

01:19:37.820 --> 01:19:39.738
then goddamn it, I will.

01:19:39.822 --> 01:19:42.241
I respect your artistry
and your methods.

01:19:42.324 --> 01:19:43.784
If you can't fill us in yet,

01:19:43.867 --> 01:19:47.913
hell, we should be kissing your feet
for your fine efforts.

01:19:49.414 --> 01:19:50.833
You know...

01:19:54.503 --> 01:19:57.464
in the old country,
we were taught as young children

01:19:57.506 --> 01:20:00.217
that there's no shame
in supplicating yourself

01:20:00.300 --> 01:20:01.885
when you respect someone.

01:20:01.969 --> 01:20:04.012
On behalf of Capitol Pictures,

01:20:04.096 --> 01:20:07.641
the administration,
and all of the stockholders,

01:20:07.724 --> 01:20:09.685
please accept this

01:20:09.726 --> 01:20:13.105
as a symbol of
our apology and respect.

01:20:40.257 --> 01:20:42.509
Barton, can I come in?

01:20:55.230 --> 01:20:58.150
Jesus... you're leaving?

01:20:58.233 --> 01:21:01.278
Have to, old-timer,
just for a little while.

01:21:01.361 --> 01:21:03.071
Jesus.

01:21:03.155 --> 01:21:04.322
Charlie, I...

01:21:04.323 --> 01:21:06.074
Everything's okay, believe me.

01:21:06.158 --> 01:21:08.076
I know it's rough mentally,

01:21:08.160 --> 01:21:10.537
but everything's been taken care of.

01:21:10.579 --> 01:21:13.373
Charlie, I got no one else here.

01:21:13.457 --> 01:21:18.086
You're the only person
I know in Los Angeles

01:21:18.170 --> 01:21:22.007
that I...
that I can talk to.

01:21:29.598 --> 01:21:30.974
I feel like I'm...

01:21:31.058 --> 01:21:34.520
like I'm losing my mind,
like I'm going crazy.

01:21:34.603 --> 01:21:36.980
I don't know what to do.

01:21:37.064 --> 01:21:40.067
I didn't do it, believe me.

01:21:40.150 --> 01:21:42.069
I... I'm sure of that, Charlie.

01:21:42.110 --> 01:21:45.072
You got to get a grip on, brother.

01:21:45.113 --> 01:21:48.075
You got to carry on till I get back.

01:21:48.116 --> 01:21:50.994
Try and stay here.
Don't talk to anyone.

01:21:51.078 --> 01:21:53.163
We got to keep our heads,

01:21:53.247 --> 01:21:55.123
and we'll figure it out.

01:21:55.207 --> 01:21:56.249
Okay, but...

01:21:56.250 --> 01:21:57.250
Don't argue.

01:21:57.251 --> 01:22:00.712
You asked me to believe you and I do.

01:22:00.796 --> 01:22:02.256
Now, don't argue with me.

01:22:02.297 --> 01:22:06.760
Look, pal,
can you do something for me?

01:22:06.802 --> 01:22:09.680
Keep that for me
till I get back.

01:22:09.763 --> 01:22:11.598
It's just a lot of personal stuff,

01:22:11.640 --> 01:22:14.601
but I don't want
to drag it with me.

01:22:14.643 --> 01:22:15.936
Funny, huh?

01:22:15.978 --> 01:22:18.939
When everything
that's important to a guy,

01:22:18.981 --> 01:22:21.942
everything he wants to keep
from a lifetime,

01:22:21.984 --> 01:22:26.947
and he can fit it all
into a little box like that.

01:22:27.030 --> 01:22:29.283
I guess...

01:22:29.324 --> 01:22:31.618
I guess it's pretty pathetic.

01:22:31.660 --> 01:22:33.954
It's more than I've got.

01:22:35.038 --> 01:22:36.498
Well, keep it for me.

01:22:36.540 --> 01:22:38.500
Maybe it'll bring you good luck.

01:22:38.542 --> 01:22:40.502
It'll help you finish your script.

01:22:40.586 --> 01:22:43.005
You'll think about me.
Make me your wrestler.

01:22:43.088 --> 01:22:45.007
Then you'll lick that story.

01:22:45.090 --> 01:22:46.299
Thanks, Charlie.

01:22:46.300 --> 01:22:47.718
Yeah, yeah, sure.

01:22:47.801 --> 01:22:50.721
I'll see you soon, friend.
You'll be fine.

01:22:50.804 --> 01:22:52.181
And you'll be back?

01:22:52.264 --> 01:22:54.224
Don't worry about that, compadre.

01:22:54.308 --> 01:22:55.893
I'll be back.

01:25:53.070 --> 01:25:55.489
You read the Bible, Pete?

01:25:57.533 --> 01:25:59.201
Holy Bible?

01:26:01.537 --> 01:26:02.830
Yeah.

01:26:04.248 --> 01:26:05.874
Yeah, I think so.

01:26:07.209 --> 01:26:09.336
Anyway, I've heard about it.

01:26:23.559 --> 01:26:24.685
Fink?

01:26:24.768 --> 01:26:25.936
Yeah.

01:26:26.019 --> 01:26:27.771
Detective Mastrionotti.

01:26:27.855 --> 01:26:29.690
Detective Deutsch.

01:26:29.731 --> 01:26:31.024
L.A.P.D.

01:26:31.108 --> 01:26:32.401
Uh-huh.

01:26:32.484 --> 01:26:34.903
Got some questions
we want to ask you.

01:26:34.987 --> 01:26:37.698
Just routine.
Sit down.

01:26:37.781 --> 01:26:39.992
What do you do, Fink?

01:26:41.869 --> 01:26:43.453
I... I write.

01:26:43.537 --> 01:26:45.414
Oh, yeah?
What kind of writing?

01:26:45.497 --> 01:26:48.083
As a matter of fact,
I write for the pictures.

01:26:48.167 --> 01:26:49.585
Big fucking deal.

01:26:49.668 --> 01:26:51.712
Should my partner
kiss your ass?

01:26:51.795 --> 01:26:53.213
I didn't mean to sound...

01:26:53.297 --> 01:26:54.715
What did you mean?

01:26:54.756 --> 01:26:57.384
I got respect
for working guys like you.

01:26:57.468 --> 01:26:59.428
Jesus, ain't that a load off.

01:26:59.511 --> 01:27:00.888
You live in 621?

01:27:00.971 --> 01:27:02.055
Yeah.

01:27:02.139 --> 01:27:03.265
How long?

01:27:03.348 --> 01:27:04.975
A week. Eight, nine days.

01:27:05.058 --> 01:27:06.393
This multiple choice?

01:27:06.477 --> 01:27:08.896
You know this slob?

01:27:17.946 --> 01:27:20.824
Yeah, he lives next door to me.

01:27:20.908 --> 01:27:22.326
That's right, Fink.

01:27:22.409 --> 01:27:25.120
He lives next door to you.

01:27:25.204 --> 01:27:27.581
You ever talk to him?

01:27:27.623 --> 01:27:29.041
Once or twice.

01:27:29.124 --> 01:27:31.710
His name is Charlie Meadows.

01:27:31.793 --> 01:27:33.712
Yeah, and I'm Buck Rogers.

01:27:33.795 --> 01:27:36.215
His name's Mundt.
Karl Mundt.

01:27:36.298 --> 01:27:38.217
Also known as Madman Mundt.

01:27:38.300 --> 01:27:40.677
A little funny in the head.

01:27:40.761 --> 01:27:42.179
What did he...

01:27:42.262 --> 01:27:45.182
He likes to ventilate people
with a shotgun

01:27:45.265 --> 01:27:46.767
and cut their heads off.

01:27:46.850 --> 01:27:48.268
Yeah, he's funny that way.

01:27:48.310 --> 01:27:50.646
Started in Kansas City.
Couple of housewives.

01:27:50.729 --> 01:27:53.148
We got the same M.O. in Los Feliz.

01:27:53.232 --> 01:27:55.150
Doctor.
Ear, nose, and throat man.

01:27:55.234 --> 01:27:56.652
All of which is missing.

01:27:56.735 --> 01:27:58.153
Well, some throat was there.

01:27:58.237 --> 01:27:59.696
Physician, heal thyself.

01:27:59.780 --> 01:28:01.949
Good luck with
no fucking head.

01:28:01.990 --> 01:28:04.492
Hollywood precinct finds
another stiff yesterday

01:28:04.493 --> 01:28:05.869
not too far from here.

01:28:05.953 --> 01:28:08.539
This one's better-looking
than the doc.

01:28:08.622 --> 01:28:10.958
Female Caucasian,
about 30 years old,

01:28:10.999 --> 01:28:12.501
nice tits, no head.

01:28:12.543 --> 01:28:15.002
Ever see Mundt with anyone
fits that description?

01:28:15.003 --> 01:28:18.173
But, you know,
with the head still on.

01:28:19.383 --> 01:28:22.344
No, I never saw him
with anyone else.

01:28:22.386 --> 01:28:25.347
So you did talk to Mundt.
What about?

01:28:25.430 --> 01:28:26.974
Nothing, really.

01:28:27.057 --> 01:28:30.018
He said he was
in the insurance business.

01:28:30.102 --> 01:28:32.020
Yeah, and he's Buck Rogers.

01:28:32.104 --> 01:28:34.982
No reputable company
would hire a guy like that.

01:28:35.065 --> 01:28:36.357
That's what he said.

01:28:36.358 --> 01:28:37.693
What else?

01:28:40.028 --> 01:28:42.364
I'm trying to think.

01:28:42.447 --> 01:28:45.325
Nothing, really. He...

01:28:45.367 --> 01:28:50.205
He said he liked
Jack Oakie pictures.

01:28:50.289 --> 01:28:55.419
You know, ordinarily we say
anything you might remember

01:28:55.502 --> 01:28:56.920
could be helpful,

01:28:57.004 --> 01:28:59.965
but I'll be frank with you, Fink.

01:29:00.048 --> 01:29:01.758
That is not helpful.

01:29:01.842 --> 01:29:04.887
Notice how he's not writing it down?

01:29:04.970 --> 01:29:07.097
Fink.

01:29:07.181 --> 01:29:09.475
That's a...

01:29:09.558 --> 01:29:11.768
a Jewish name, isn't it?

01:29:11.852 --> 01:29:13.020
Yeah.

01:29:13.061 --> 01:29:14.646
Yeah.

01:29:14.730 --> 01:29:17.983
I didn't think
this dump was restricted.

01:29:18.066 --> 01:29:20.527
Mundt has disappeared.

01:29:20.569 --> 01:29:23.030
I don't think he'll be back,

01:29:23.071 --> 01:29:26.700
but give me a call
if you see him...

01:29:28.535 --> 01:29:32.414
or if you remember something
that isn't totally idiotic.

01:31:17.686 --> 01:31:19.188
"Fade in.

01:31:19.229 --> 01:31:25.736
Ayoung hussy opens the door...

01:31:25.819 --> 01:31:29.781
to the burlyman's...

01:31:29.865 --> 01:31:30.991
apartment.

01:31:31.033 --> 01:31:33.368
If you were a man,

01:31:33.452 --> 01:31:37.331
a real man,

01:31:37.372 --> 01:31:39.374
you'd slap me."

01:31:40.626 --> 01:31:45.047
"I put my mark on you first...

01:31:45.088 --> 01:31:48.675
in... delibly."

01:31:58.936 --> 01:32:00.854
"Boardinghouse,

01:32:00.938 --> 01:32:02.271
painted women,

01:32:02.272 --> 01:32:04.233
and the burlyman..."

01:32:04.274 --> 01:32:05.692
"Why'd you arrest him?"

01:32:05.776 --> 01:32:09.822
"With one lightning move
with his mighty arms,

01:32:09.905 --> 01:32:11.072
the burlyman..."

01:32:11.073 --> 01:32:12.491
"She's a good woman..."

01:32:12.574 --> 01:32:17.454
"I don't care what people say..."

01:32:17.538 --> 01:32:21.166
"So, Burlyman,
we have to deduct those expenses

01:32:21.250 --> 01:32:23.085
from your personal..."

01:32:23.168 --> 01:32:27.422
"Don't you care for me
after all these years?"

01:32:27.506 --> 01:32:29.925
Hold the line, sir.
I have your call.

01:32:30.008 --> 01:32:32.970
Hello, operator!
I can't...

01:32:33.053 --> 01:32:35.597
Oh, God.

01:32:38.058 --> 01:32:39.267
Ahem. Hello?

01:32:39.268 --> 01:32:40.727
Garland, it's me.

01:32:40.769 --> 01:32:42.062
Barton?

01:32:42.104 --> 01:32:44.106
Wh-What time is it?

01:32:44.148 --> 01:32:45.566
Are you all right?

01:32:45.649 --> 01:32:47.067
Yeah, I'm... I'm fine.

01:32:47.151 --> 01:32:49.570
I have to talk to you, Garland.

01:32:49.611 --> 01:32:51.071
I'm calling long-distance.

01:32:51.113 --> 01:32:53.574
What is it, Barton?
Are you okay?

01:32:53.615 --> 01:32:55.117
Yeah, I'm fine, Garland,

01:32:55.159 --> 01:32:56.577
but we have to talk.

01:32:56.618 --> 01:32:58.620
It's about what I'm writing.

01:32:58.662 --> 01:33:00.247
I think...

01:33:00.330 --> 01:33:01.874
it's really...

01:33:03.125 --> 01:33:05.085
I think it's really big.

01:33:05.127 --> 01:33:07.004
What do you mean, Barton?

01:33:07.087 --> 01:33:09.548
Not big in the sense of large,

01:33:09.631 --> 01:33:11.049
although it's that, too.

01:33:11.133 --> 01:33:12.926
I... I mean important.

01:33:12.968 --> 01:33:15.929
This may be
the most important work

01:33:15.971 --> 01:33:17.431
I've ever done.

01:33:17.473 --> 01:33:19.850
Barton, is everything okay?

01:33:19.933 --> 01:33:22.269
You sound a little, um...

01:33:22.311 --> 01:33:24.688
Sound a little what?

01:33:24.771 --> 01:33:26.940
You sound a little, um...

01:33:26.982 --> 01:33:28.942
Thanks, Garland.

01:33:29.026 --> 01:33:31.278
Thanks for all the encouragement.

01:33:33.864 --> 01:33:35.199
Nitwit.

01:34:39.304 --> 01:34:40.472
Whoo!

01:34:40.556 --> 01:34:42.141
You're cute.

01:35:09.251 --> 01:35:11.753
Excuse me, buddy.
Mind if I cut in?

01:35:11.837 --> 01:35:14.798
This is my dance, sailor.

01:35:14.882 --> 01:35:18.510
Hey, come on, buddy.
I'm shipping out tomorrow.

01:35:18.594 --> 01:35:20.721
I'm a writer

01:35:20.762 --> 01:35:23.557
celebrating the completion
of something good.

01:35:23.640 --> 01:35:25.851
Do you understand that, sailor?

01:35:25.934 --> 01:35:27.686
Beat it, creep.

01:35:27.769 --> 01:35:30.189
Come on, buddy,
give the navy a dance.

01:35:30.272 --> 01:35:32.065
Let somebody else spin the dame.

01:35:32.149 --> 01:35:33.901
Step aside, four eyes!

01:35:33.942 --> 01:35:35.527
4-F, take a hike!

01:35:35.611 --> 01:35:37.404
Go sit on a tomato.

01:35:37.488 --> 01:35:40.365
I'm a writer, you monsters!

01:35:40.449 --> 01:35:41.617
I create!

01:35:41.700 --> 01:35:43.619
I create for a living!

01:35:43.702 --> 01:35:45.579
I'm a creator!

01:35:45.662 --> 01:35:47.080
I am a creator!

01:35:47.164 --> 01:35:48.248
Screwy!

01:35:48.332 --> 01:35:50.959
This is my uniform.

01:35:51.043 --> 01:35:53.962
This is how I serve the common man!

01:35:54.046 --> 01:35:55.631
This is where I...

01:35:57.132 --> 01:35:58.801
Get 'em, boys!

01:36:38.423 --> 01:36:39.842
"He left this morning.

01:36:39.925 --> 01:36:42.845
Said he had a job to do.

01:36:42.928 --> 01:36:46.056
There was something in his eyes,

01:36:46.140 --> 01:36:47.891
something new.

01:36:47.975 --> 01:36:51.395
What's to become of him?"

01:36:54.439 --> 01:36:57.734
We'll be hearing
from that crazy wrestler,

01:36:57.818 --> 01:37:00.779
and I don't mean a postcard.

01:37:00.863 --> 01:37:02.739
Fade out.

01:37:02.823 --> 01:37:04.074
The end."

01:37:05.868 --> 01:37:07.828
I thought you said
you were a writer.

01:37:07.870 --> 01:37:11.165
I don't know, Duke.
I kind of liked it.

01:37:11.206 --> 01:37:13.917
Keep your filthy eyes
off of that.

01:37:15.210 --> 01:37:17.337
You made the morning papers, Fink.

01:37:17.421 --> 01:37:19.840
Second one of
your friends to die.

01:37:19.923 --> 01:37:22.342
You do get around, don't you?

01:37:22.426 --> 01:37:25.012
You didn't tell us
you knew the dame.

01:37:25.095 --> 01:37:27.848
Sixth floor too high for you, Fink?

01:37:27.890 --> 01:37:29.475
Give you nosebleeds?

01:37:30.392 --> 01:37:32.352
Just tell me one thing.

01:37:32.436 --> 01:37:34.354
Where'd you put the heads?

01:37:34.438 --> 01:37:36.690
Charlie.

01:37:36.732 --> 01:37:38.317
Charlie's back.

01:37:38.400 --> 01:37:39.860
No kidding, bright boy.

01:37:39.943 --> 01:37:42.613
We smelled Mundt all over this.

01:37:42.696 --> 01:37:44.364
Was he the idea man?

01:37:44.406 --> 01:37:45.866
Tell us where the heads are.

01:37:45.949 --> 01:37:47.951
Maybe they'll go easy on you.

01:37:48.035 --> 01:37:49.369
Only fry you once.

01:37:49.453 --> 01:37:51.205
Come back later.
It's too hot.

01:37:51.246 --> 01:37:52.539
My head's killing me.

01:37:52.623 --> 01:37:54.583
All right, forget the heads.

01:37:54.666 --> 01:37:56.043
Where's Mundt, Fink?

01:37:56.126 --> 01:37:57.544
He teach you how to do it?

01:37:57.586 --> 01:37:59.379
You two have some sick sex thing?

01:37:59.463 --> 01:38:00.380
Sex?

01:38:00.464 --> 01:38:01.882
He's a man.

01:38:01.965 --> 01:38:03.926
We wrestled.

01:38:06.845 --> 01:38:08.722
You're a sick fuck, Fink.

01:38:08.764 --> 01:38:11.058
Charlie's back.

01:38:11.141 --> 01:38:12.559
It's hot.

01:38:12.601 --> 01:38:13.519
He's back.

01:38:38.794 --> 01:38:40.504
Fred.

01:38:46.260 --> 01:38:47.886
Sit tight, Fink.

01:38:53.517 --> 01:38:56.687
Why's it so goddamn hot out here?

01:38:58.355 --> 01:38:59.439
Duke.

01:39:27.843 --> 01:39:29.428
Mundt!

01:39:34.183 --> 01:39:35.309
Mundt!

01:39:35.350 --> 01:39:37.603
Show yourself.

01:39:59.249 --> 01:40:01.001
There's a boy, Mundt.

01:40:03.086 --> 01:40:05.005
Put the policy case down

01:40:05.047 --> 01:40:06.840
and your mitts in the air.

01:40:16.683 --> 01:40:18.060
He's complying.

01:40:22.731 --> 01:40:25.234
Look upon me!

01:40:25.317 --> 01:40:28.362
I'll show you the life of the mind!

01:40:28.445 --> 01:40:30.531
Aah!

01:40:30.614 --> 01:40:32.366
Aah!

01:40:32.407 --> 01:40:34.868
Aah! Look upon me!

01:40:34.910 --> 01:40:38.997
Aah! I'll show you
the life of the mind!

01:40:39.081 --> 01:40:41.667
I'll show you the life of the mind!

01:40:41.750 --> 01:40:43.544
I'll show you the life of the mind!

01:40:43.627 --> 01:40:47.548
I will show you the life
of the mind!

01:40:48.674 --> 01:40:50.551
Aah!

01:41:15.742 --> 01:41:17.870
Heil, Hitler.

01:41:17.911 --> 01:41:21.206
Aah!

01:41:31.133 --> 01:41:32.384
Barton.

01:41:35.512 --> 01:41:38.056
Brother, is it hot.

01:41:39.433 --> 01:41:41.185
How you been, buddy?

01:41:42.936 --> 01:41:45.856
Well, don't look at me like that.

01:41:45.939 --> 01:41:48.734
It's just me... Charlie.

01:41:48.775 --> 01:41:50.277
I hear it's Mundt.

01:41:50.319 --> 01:41:53.405
Madman Mundt?

01:41:53.489 --> 01:41:55.824
Jesus, people can be cruel.

01:41:55.908 --> 01:42:00.037
If it's not my build,
it's my personality.

01:42:05.876 --> 01:42:08.629
They say I'm a madman, Bart,

01:42:08.712 --> 01:42:11.340
but I'm not mad at anyone.

01:42:11.423 --> 01:42:12.800
Honest, I'm not.

01:42:12.883 --> 01:42:16.470
Most guys I just feel sorry for.

01:42:16.553 --> 01:42:18.472
It tears me up inside

01:42:18.555 --> 01:42:21.475
to think about what
they're going through,

01:42:21.558 --> 01:42:23.977
how trapped they are.

01:42:25.062 --> 01:42:27.022
I understand it.

01:42:28.148 --> 01:42:29.983
I feel for them.

01:42:32.528 --> 01:42:35.489
So I try and help them out.

01:42:35.531 --> 01:42:36.782
Jesus.

01:42:38.784 --> 01:42:39.827
Yeah.

01:42:39.910 --> 01:42:41.578
Yeah.

01:42:41.662 --> 01:42:44.081
I know what it feels like

01:42:44.164 --> 01:42:46.583
when things get all balled up

01:42:46.667 --> 01:42:48.085
at the head office.

01:42:48.168 --> 01:42:50.754
They put you through hell, Barton.

01:42:52.172 --> 01:42:54.675
So I help people out.

01:42:57.177 --> 01:43:01.265
I just wish someone
would do as much for me.

01:43:02.850 --> 01:43:05.936
Jesus, it's hot.

01:43:09.648 --> 01:43:11.525
Sometimes it gets so hot

01:43:11.608 --> 01:43:15.154
I want to crawl
right out of my skin.

01:43:15.195 --> 01:43:18.490
But, Charlie, why me?

01:43:18.532 --> 01:43:19.658
Why...

01:43:19.700 --> 01:43:23.328
Because you don't listen!

01:43:31.170 --> 01:43:32.880
Jesus.

01:43:32.963 --> 01:43:34.590
I'm dripping again.

01:43:37.676 --> 01:43:40.012
Come on, Barton,

01:43:40.053 --> 01:43:43.182
you think you know pain?

01:43:44.558 --> 01:43:47.853
You think I made your life hell?

01:43:49.188 --> 01:43:50.564
Look around this dump.

01:43:50.647 --> 01:43:53.609
You're just a tourist
with a typewriter.

01:43:53.692 --> 01:43:56.570
I live here.
Don't you understand that?

01:44:03.368 --> 01:44:06.330
And you come into my home...

01:44:08.457 --> 01:44:10.375
and you complain

01:44:10.417 --> 01:44:14.379
that I'm making too much noise.

01:44:25.933 --> 01:44:27.893
I'm sorry.

01:44:34.983 --> 01:44:37.110
Don't be.

01:45:24.700 --> 01:45:27.786
I'll be next door
if you need me.

01:45:31.790 --> 01:45:33.125
Oh...

01:45:33.167 --> 01:45:35.669
I dropped in on
your folks in New York.

01:45:35.752 --> 01:45:38.755
And Uncle Maury.

01:45:38.839 --> 01:45:40.215
Good people.

01:45:46.555 --> 01:45:49.516
By the way,
that package I gave you...

01:45:49.558 --> 01:45:51.101
I lied.

01:45:51.185 --> 01:45:53.187
It isn't mine.

01:46:57.251 --> 01:46:58.585
Fink.

01:46:58.669 --> 01:47:00.087
Samuel or Lillian Fink.

01:47:00.170 --> 01:47:01.588
85 Fulton Street.

01:47:01.672 --> 01:47:03.132
Or Uncle Maury.

01:47:03.215 --> 01:47:06.051
I understand that,
but there's still no answer.

01:47:06.093 --> 01:47:07.052
Mr. Fink?

01:47:07.094 --> 01:47:10.055
Shall I check for trouble
on the line?

01:47:15.936 --> 01:47:18.188
Fink.

01:47:18.272 --> 01:47:19.606
Mr. Lipnick.

01:47:19.690 --> 01:47:22.109
Colonel Lipnick...
if you don't mind.

01:47:22.192 --> 01:47:23.443
Sit down.

01:47:23.527 --> 01:47:25.736
I was commissioned yesterday
in the army reserve.

01:47:25.737 --> 01:47:28.448
Henry Morgenthau arranged it.
Dear friend.

01:47:28.532 --> 01:47:30.450
Congratulations.

01:47:30.492 --> 01:47:31.701
It hasn't officially
gone through yet.

01:47:31.702 --> 01:47:33.120
Had wardrobe whip this up.

01:47:33.203 --> 01:47:35.164
Got to pull teeth
to get anything done.

01:47:35.247 --> 01:47:37.458
Can understand
red tape in peacetime,

01:47:37.541 --> 01:47:39.626
but now it's all-out warfare
against theJaps.

01:47:39.710 --> 01:47:42.421
They'd love to see me
sit this one out.

01:47:42.463 --> 01:47:44.965
Yes, sir.
They, uh...

01:47:45.048 --> 01:47:48.677
Anyway, I had Lou
read your script for me.

01:47:48.760 --> 01:47:51.180
I got to tell you, Fink...

01:47:51.263 --> 01:47:52.890
it won't wash.

01:47:52.973 --> 01:47:54.056
With all due respect,

01:47:54.057 --> 01:47:56.310
I think it's
the best work I've done.

01:47:56.393 --> 01:47:57.685
Don't gas me, Fink.

01:47:57.686 --> 01:48:01.648
If your opinion mattered,
I'd let you run the studio.

01:48:01.732 --> 01:48:04.275
The lunatics aren't going to run
this particular asylum.

01:48:04.276 --> 01:48:07.029
Let's put a stop
to that rumor right now.

01:48:07.154 --> 01:48:09.281
Yes, sir.

01:48:09.323 --> 01:48:10.908
Had to call Beery this morning,

01:48:10.991 --> 01:48:13.660
tell him we were pushing
the picture back.

01:48:13.702 --> 01:48:15.621
After all I told him about quality,

01:48:15.662 --> 01:48:16.955
about that Barton Fink feeling,

01:48:17.039 --> 01:48:18.415
how disappointed we were.

01:48:18.499 --> 01:48:21.418
Wally was heartbroken.
The man was devastated.

01:48:21.502 --> 01:48:23.921
I didn't actually call him.
Lou did.

01:48:24.004 --> 01:48:26.715
That's a fair description,
isn't it, Lou?

01:48:26.799 --> 01:48:27.840
Yes, Colonel.

01:48:27.841 --> 01:48:31.303
I could take you
through it step-by-step,

01:48:31.345 --> 01:48:33.305
explaining why
your story stinks,

01:48:33.347 --> 01:48:35.766
but I won't insult
your intelligence.

01:48:35.849 --> 01:48:36.891
Well, all right.

01:48:36.892 --> 01:48:39.269
First of all,
this is a wrestling picture.

01:48:39.353 --> 01:48:42.606
The audience wants to see action,
adventure, wrestling.

01:48:42.689 --> 01:48:45.984
They don't want to see a guy
wrestling with his soul.

01:48:46.068 --> 01:48:47.611
All right, some for the critics.

01:48:47.694 --> 01:48:50.155
You make it the carrot
that wags the dog.

01:48:50.197 --> 01:48:52.032
Too much,
they head for the exits.

01:48:52.115 --> 01:48:55.035
There's plenty of poetry
inside that ring, Fink.

01:48:55.118 --> 01:48:57.329
Look at Hell 10 Feet Square.

01:48:57.371 --> 01:48:58.664
Blood, Sweat, and Canvas.

01:48:58.705 --> 01:48:59.956
Blood, Sweat, and Canvas.

01:48:59.957 --> 01:49:02.918
These are big movies,
Fink, about big men.

01:49:03.001 --> 01:49:03.877
In tights!

01:49:03.961 --> 01:49:06.380
Both physically
and mentally...

01:49:06.421 --> 01:49:08.173
especially physically.

01:49:08.215 --> 01:49:10.843
We don't put Wally Beery
in a fruity movie about suffering.

01:49:10.884 --> 01:49:13.762
I thought we were
together on that.

01:49:15.055 --> 01:49:17.391
I'm sorry if I let you down.

01:49:17.474 --> 01:49:19.518
You didn't let me down
or even Lou.

01:49:19.560 --> 01:49:22.354
We don't live or die
by what you scribble.

01:49:22.396 --> 01:49:23.689
You let Ben Geisler down.

01:49:23.730 --> 01:49:25.691
He liked you,
trusted you.

01:49:25.732 --> 01:49:27.734
That's why he's gone.
He's fired.

01:49:27.776 --> 01:49:29.695
That man had a big heart.

01:49:29.736 --> 01:49:31.028
You fucked him.

01:49:31.029 --> 01:49:33.198
He tried to convince me
to fire you, too,

01:49:33.240 --> 01:49:34.700
but that'd be too easy.

01:49:34.741 --> 01:49:36.702
You're under contract.
You'll stay that way.

01:49:36.743 --> 01:49:39.245
Anything you write is
property of Capitol Pictures.

01:49:39.246 --> 01:49:42.207
Capitol Pictures won't produce
anything you write...

01:49:42.249 --> 01:49:44.751
not until you
grow up a little.

01:49:44.835 --> 01:49:47.254
You ain't no writer, Fink.

01:49:47.296 --> 01:49:49.756
You're a goddamn write-off.

01:49:51.467 --> 01:49:54.761
I... I tried to show you...

01:49:54.803 --> 01:49:56.221
something beautiful.

01:49:58.265 --> 01:50:00.267
Something about all of us.

01:50:00.309 --> 01:50:01.393
I...

01:50:01.435 --> 01:50:05.230
You arrogant
son of a bitch.

01:50:05.272 --> 01:50:07.649
You think
you're the only writer

01:50:07.733 --> 01:50:10.194
that can give me
that Barton Fink feeling?

01:50:10.277 --> 01:50:12.779
I got 20 writers
under contract

01:50:12.863 --> 01:50:15.741
I can ask for
a Fink-type thing from!

01:50:15.782 --> 01:50:17.159
You swell-headed hypocrite.

01:50:17.242 --> 01:50:18.494
You don't get it.

01:50:18.577 --> 01:50:19.911
You think the whole world

01:50:19.912 --> 01:50:21.497
revolves around
whatever rattles

01:50:21.580 --> 01:50:24.666
inside that little
kike head of yours.

01:50:24.750 --> 01:50:27.336
Get him out of my sight, Lou!

01:50:27.419 --> 01:50:29.171
I want him in town, though.

01:50:29.254 --> 01:50:30.714
He's still under contract.

01:50:30.798 --> 01:50:34.968
I want you in town
and out of my sight.

01:50:35.010 --> 01:50:37.179
Now, get lost.

01:50:37.262 --> 01:50:38.847
There's a war on.

01:51:37.072 --> 01:51:39.491
It's a beautiful day.

01:51:39.533 --> 01:51:40.659
Huh?

01:51:46.874 --> 01:51:49.835
I said it's a beautiful day.

01:51:49.877 --> 01:51:51.211
Yes.

01:51:51.295 --> 01:51:53.046
It is.

01:51:55.716 --> 01:51:57.676
What's in the box?

01:51:59.595 --> 01:52:01.472
I don't know.

01:52:02.764 --> 01:52:04.558
Isn't it yours?

01:52:09.730 --> 01:52:11.815
I don't know.

01:52:17.738 --> 01:52:19.948
You're very beautiful.

01:52:24.745 --> 01:52:26.830
Are you in pictures?

01:52:28.081 --> 01:52:30.000
Don't be silly.

01:52:52.700 --> 01:52:55.703
