[electrical crackling]

00:09.300 --> 00:10.927
[humming]

00:11.010 --> 00:15.473
[upbeat rhythmic music plays]

00:16.057 --> 00:18.101
[engine roars]

00:20.520 --> 00:21.521
[tires squeal]

00:22.022 --> 00:25.942
[tense music plays]

00:26.526 --> 00:30.822
I can't believe someone made it look like
we robbed spy headquarters at my event!

00:30.905 --> 00:32.824
Talk about a party foul!

00:32.907 --> 00:35.410
If we can find the footage
from the night of the attack,

00:35.493 --> 00:38.788
I might be able to analyze it
and figure out what actually happened.

00:38.872 --> 00:41.124
We'll need to find a place to lay low.

00:41.207 --> 00:43.418
-Let's see what's around here!
-No! Don't.

00:44.127 --> 00:48.590
[sighs] I may have installed
agency tracking devices

00:48.673 --> 00:51.009
to keep tabs on your every move.

00:51.342 --> 00:53.219
So that means we can't use, like,

00:53.303 --> 00:55.597
half the hauler's equipment
without being tracked?

00:55.930 --> 00:58.391
Technically, more like 79.8%.

00:58.975 --> 01:00.769
-Cool.
-It could be worse.

01:00.852 --> 01:02.228
At least we're cloaked.

01:02.312 --> 01:04.981
[dramatic music plays]

01:07.400 --> 01:08.943
[Echo] Uh, I'll fix that.

01:09.736 --> 01:10.862
As far as I'm concerned,

01:10.945 --> 01:13.865
Uncle Tuco's the only X factor
in this whole equation.

01:13.948 --> 01:16.785
He wasn't invited to my party,
and I shouldn't have let him in.

01:17.285 --> 01:20.663
I was just so wrapped up
in that magical evening.

01:20.747 --> 01:25.168
The exploding food, the deadly games,
the redacted letters...

01:25.251 --> 01:26.336
It made me soft!

01:26.836 --> 01:30.590
Yeah. Also, Tuco did conveniently
disappear right before the attack,

01:30.673 --> 01:33.051
and he knows everything
thanks to Cisco's big mouth.

01:33.134 --> 01:35.512
Come on, Uncle Tuco
would never betray us like that.

01:35.929 --> 01:37.722
I'm sure he's back in Mexico City now,

01:37.806 --> 01:41.059
being a great family member
and not framing us.

01:41.142 --> 01:43.728
You willing to risk your life on that?

01:43.812 --> 01:44.979
Because I'm not.

01:45.063 --> 01:48.858
Then we know what we need to do.
Find Uncle Tuco and make him talk.

01:48.942 --> 01:50.860
By any means necessary.

01:50.944 --> 01:53.071
[whimpers]

01:53.321 --> 01:56.199
Easy, Gum Neck! I'm not a monster.

01:56.282 --> 02:00.662
We'll go find Tuco and
simply ask him to share what he knows.

02:01.329 --> 02:05.375
But if he doesn't budge,
we'll pump him so full of truth serum

02:05.458 --> 02:08.753
he'll tell us where
his grandma hides her insulin money!

02:09.045 --> 02:10.130
Nana?

02:10.421 --> 02:13.466
Uh, that sounds pretty similar
to Layla's thing.

02:13.550 --> 02:15.760
But first, we're gonna need
cash and supplies.

02:15.844 --> 02:19.472
What are you talking about? We got
our cars, the hauler, the helicopter...

02:19.556 --> 02:20.390
We're good.

02:20.473 --> 02:22.559
You gonna eat that helicopter, genius?

02:22.642 --> 02:25.645
Or trade it for gas
to run all these vehicles?

02:25.728 --> 02:28.731
Use your head! If we want to
stay on the run, we need cash money.

02:28.815 --> 02:31.693
-Can't we just sell the helicopter?
-[Ms. Nowhere] No!

02:32.193 --> 02:35.405
You never know when you'll need
a spare helicopter for added leverage.

02:35.738 --> 02:37.448
[Ms. Nowhere] That's basic training.

02:37.532 --> 02:38.366
True.

02:38.700 --> 02:41.327
And I know just where to get money.

02:41.786 --> 02:44.497
Along with a fresh stash of Paco's.

02:47.584 --> 02:49.919
[Palindrome] Ms. Nowhere
is the highest-value target

02:50.003 --> 02:52.255
I've had to chase down in a long time.

02:52.714 --> 02:55.049
Lucky for me, I've got you two.

02:55.133 --> 02:56.926
Her closest allies.

02:57.010 --> 02:59.721
The agents she's been nurturing for years.

02:59.804 --> 03:03.308
Actually, she wasn't really
the nurturing type.

03:03.391 --> 03:05.852
Yeah. She was more of
the barking orders type.

03:05.935 --> 03:07.228
[Palindrome grunts]

03:07.562 --> 03:10.273
[quietly] He did that for 45 minutes.

03:10.356 --> 03:11.232
[Palindrome] Guys.

03:11.316 --> 03:12.525
I know this is hard.

03:12.609 --> 03:15.904
Taking down the woman
who nourished you as spy seedlings,

03:15.987 --> 03:18.364
until you grew into mighty spy oaks.

03:18.448 --> 03:20.491
There was definitely none of that.

03:20.575 --> 03:24.537
Nowhere and her team are in the wind,
thanks to boy genius Frostee.

03:25.038 --> 03:28.458
I tried interrogating his associate,
but she just wouldn't crack.

03:29.208 --> 03:33.129
You said you'd talk
when we finished our tea.

03:33.212 --> 03:35.965
Mrs. Pepperpants hasn't finished her tea.

03:36.716 --> 03:40.887
Spoiler: Mrs. Pepperpants
never finished her tea.

03:40.970 --> 03:43.181
Now you two know
Ms. Nowhere better than anyone.

03:43.264 --> 03:46.809
-[tense music plays]
-Tell me everything.

03:47.227 --> 03:50.521
Well, she's a Sagittarius
but reads more Scorpio

03:50.605 --> 03:53.107
due to her resourceful
yet distrustful nature.

03:53.191 --> 03:57.195
-Her favorite color's khaki.
-It used to be khaki. Now it's black.

03:57.278 --> 04:00.198
Black isn't a color.
It's the absence of color.

04:00.281 --> 04:03.701
-[Gary] That's why she likes it.
-I meant, where could she be?

04:03.785 --> 04:07.038
Oh... Yeah, we don't know that.

04:07.121 --> 04:08.873
Okay. You're Nowhere.

04:08.957 --> 04:12.335
You're a fugitive, and you need
a place to lay low and resupply.

04:12.418 --> 04:13.503
Where do you go?

04:13.586 --> 04:16.631
Friends? Family?
Any intimate relationships?

04:16.714 --> 04:21.052
Ms. Nowhere isn't really
a relationship kinda gal.

04:21.135 --> 04:22.303
[laughing] Yeah.

04:22.387 --> 04:24.264
[Gary] They tend to end badly.

04:24.347 --> 04:25.473
Badly how?

04:25.556 --> 04:28.476
She ends up burning pictures of
the guy who dumped her for days.

04:28.559 --> 04:30.395
Where would she get that many pictures?

04:30.478 --> 04:32.605
She has us doing surveillance
on her boyfriends

04:32.689 --> 04:34.399
before she even talks to them.

04:34.899 --> 04:38.236
To have a fire that size, you'd have to be
out in the middle of nowhere.

04:38.319 --> 04:42.615
Yeah. I followed her to
some nasty cabin in the desert one time.

04:42.699 --> 04:47.537
I brought her a blanket as she fell asleep
under the cold, uncaring moon.

04:47.870 --> 04:50.790
See? It was inside you the whole time.

04:50.873 --> 04:53.042
Let your light shine, Gary!

04:53.126 --> 04:54.836
Oh, so bright.

04:55.712 --> 04:58.548
[voice breaking]
I've never felt so appreciated.

04:58.881 --> 05:01.676
Now, let's shackle these convicts!

05:01.759 --> 05:04.846
[whirring]

05:06.139 --> 05:08.558
[sniffs] Smell that?

05:08.641 --> 05:10.685
No one for hundreds of miles.

05:13.563 --> 05:15.898
[clanking]

05:16.816 --> 05:19.402
Since when do you have
your own safe house?

05:19.485 --> 05:23.156
I started collecting them in high school.
You know, as a hobby.

05:23.656 --> 05:25.867
-[elevator whirs]
-[Cisco] Makes sense.

05:26.200 --> 05:28.619
Real estate is always a good investment.

05:29.996 --> 05:32.498
You sure no one knows about this place?

05:32.582 --> 05:35.001
-[computer whirs]
-Money. Food.

05:35.084 --> 05:37.920
[alarm sounds]

05:39.630 --> 05:40.923
Ms. Nowhere, we got trouble.

05:46.054 --> 05:48.556
Uh, who's the vending machine with arms?

05:48.639 --> 05:49.849
Palindrome...

05:50.224 --> 05:53.519
[Ms. Nowhere] He's the best of the best.
An unstoppable tracker.

05:53.978 --> 05:57.607
Like if a bloodhound and a cyborg
had puppies.

05:58.066 --> 06:00.777
[Ms. Nowhere] He once trailed
a team of armed commandos

06:00.860 --> 06:04.280
through the Amazon, down through
Patagonia and across Antarctica,

06:04.363 --> 06:07.992
back up Africa, and finally
caught them disguising themselves

06:08.076 --> 06:10.536
as mimes on the streets of Paris,

06:10.620 --> 06:14.749
and trapped them in real invisible boxes.

06:14.832 --> 06:17.293
Whoa. That's like poetry.

06:17.376 --> 06:21.172
They only send him when the game
to be chased is elusive and deadly,

06:21.255 --> 06:23.674
too dangerous for anyone else to handle.

06:23.758 --> 06:25.802
[chuckles]

06:25.885 --> 06:27.929
And now he's after me.

06:28.012 --> 06:29.388
He's after all of us.

06:29.680 --> 06:33.976
Aw, man! This isn't a safe house!
It's a death trap!

06:34.310 --> 06:36.270
I'll head outside and distract him.

06:36.354 --> 06:37.688
You all disable his transport

06:37.772 --> 06:41.192
and get those supply bags in the hauler
without making a peep.

06:41.275 --> 06:43.444
[ominous music plays]

06:43.778 --> 06:45.196
Palindrome.

06:45.279 --> 06:48.825
I see your bicep veins
are even bigger in person.

06:49.283 --> 06:52.078
Thank you. I like to get
my blood where it's going.

06:52.578 --> 06:55.957
Nice stink-eye. I can smell it from here.

06:56.249 --> 06:58.668
Well, smell this, Palindrome:

06:58.751 --> 07:00.044
I'm not going in.

07:00.628 --> 07:05.133
You got two choices, Nowhere:
going in, or going down.

07:05.883 --> 07:09.178
[Ms. Nowhere] How about a third choice:
going to your funeral.

07:09.887 --> 07:13.808
How about a fourth choice: going to yours!

07:13.891 --> 07:17.311
Isn't that the same as the second choice?
Going down?

07:17.395 --> 07:19.230
This is so intense.

07:20.314 --> 07:21.357
How are we doing?

07:21.441 --> 07:23.651
They're almost to Palindrome's car
with the EMPs.

07:23.734 --> 07:26.821
Once they disable it, we can
grab Ms. Nowhere and get out of here.

07:26.904 --> 07:29.240
You picked the wrong side, Gare-Bear!

07:29.323 --> 07:31.659
-Ms. Nowhere! This will not end well!
-[beeping]

07:31.742 --> 07:33.327
Please, just turn yourself in.

07:33.411 --> 07:35.663
[beeping]

07:36.247 --> 07:37.665
[car alarm sounds]

07:37.957 --> 07:39.750
EMPs? Really?

07:41.669 --> 07:44.464
-[electrical crackling]
-[atmospheric music plays]

07:47.341 --> 07:48.176
Give up!

07:48.468 --> 07:50.970
-It's the smart play.

-[music intensifies]
-[Palindrome roars]

08:02.482 --> 08:03.941
-[Echo] The cash!
-Leave it.

[grunting]

08:18.998 --> 08:19.999
[gasping]

08:20.458 --> 08:21.584
Gotcha.

08:22.084 --> 08:23.211
-[squelching]
-[yelps]

08:23.794 --> 08:26.631
[grunting]

08:26.714 --> 08:29.967
[laughs] Buh-bye!

08:30.384 --> 08:33.095
Time to let an outlaw
take over this operation.

08:33.179 --> 08:34.472
You get Gary's phone?

08:38.935 --> 08:41.229
[ominous music plays]

08:41.938 --> 08:46.067
[Layla] Now that Nowhere's safe house
is burnt and all we got was pork pies,

08:46.150 --> 08:48.903
we're gonna have to get our hands dirty
and earn some cash.

08:48.986 --> 08:51.072
Luckily, I still have connections.

08:51.155 --> 08:53.741
[hip-hop music plays]

08:53.824 --> 08:55.952
[grunting]

08:56.619 --> 08:58.287
Ooh, tiny umbrellas!

08:58.371 --> 09:01.249
Dang! You've really upped your game
since SH1FT3R split.

09:01.332 --> 09:03.501
Yeah, I was tired of
living that desk life.

09:03.584 --> 09:07.213
[sing-songy] Now I'm living
that deck life! [laughs]

09:07.296 --> 09:08.881
Once Shashi got arrested,

09:08.965 --> 09:12.760
I took over his racing empire,
and now I'm doing pretty well for myself.

09:12.843 --> 09:14.470
Well, congratulations.

09:14.554 --> 09:17.682
Look, I'm gonna cut to the chase.
We need to make some quick cash.

09:17.765 --> 09:18.599
Can you help us?

09:18.683 --> 09:21.894
First: love that you thought of me, Layla.
Second: I got you, girl.

09:21.978 --> 09:24.855
There's a circuit in Ensenada
run by a couple of my competitors.

09:24.939 --> 09:26.732
If you win, there's a cash prize.

09:26.816 --> 09:29.527
Oh, that’s nice of you
to recommend us to your competitors.

09:29.902 --> 09:32.572
Well, I want you to do something for me
when you're there.

09:32.655 --> 09:36.325
I need you to pull a heist
and get a list of racers' names.

09:36.409 --> 09:38.452
Some people I want running on my circuit.

09:38.744 --> 09:41.664
You keep the cash, I get the list.
It's a win-win.

09:41.747 --> 09:43.332
No problem. Where's this race?

09:43.416 --> 09:44.584
Uh, not so fast.

09:44.667 --> 09:48.170
I'm gonna need some assurances
that you're gonna give me what I want.

09:48.254 --> 09:51.507
Layla's got a bit of a reputation
as a double-crosser.

09:51.591 --> 09:52.592
[groans]

09:52.675 --> 09:53.593
We know.

09:54.176 --> 09:56.012
Text me that list in 48 hours,

09:56.095 --> 10:00.891
or I'll have to contact a certain agency
about some fugitives I saw. [laughs]

10:00.975 --> 10:05.062
And we wouldn't want that to happen.
Nuh-uh. That's a lose-lose.

10:05.146 --> 10:06.188
You'll get your list.

10:06.272 --> 10:11.027
And keep my reputation out of your mouth,
or you'll find out how far you can swim.

10:11.110 --> 10:13.529
[nervously] Hey, we're cool. Cool.

10:13.613 --> 10:15.573
I just sent you directions to the race.

10:15.656 --> 10:19.869
But, I got to warn you.
These guys... make their own rules.

10:20.453 --> 10:22.121
[cell phones beep]

10:22.580 --> 10:25.291
Now, who wants in
on the hot tub?! [laughs]

10:25.374 --> 10:28.919
It's actually more of a lukewarm tub,
because hot water hurts my tootsies.

10:31.339 --> 10:34.967
We win this race, we'll have enough money
to make the 1,700 miles to Mexico City

10:35.051 --> 10:36.552
and find out who framed us.

10:36.636 --> 10:39.847
Hey, I'm cool with a fugitive road trip
as much as the next guy,

10:39.930 --> 10:43.059
but I'm telling you, Tuco wasn't involved.

10:43.643 --> 10:44.852
You know what they say.

10:44.935 --> 10:48.439
Good detective work is as much about
clearing suspects as it is finding them.

10:48.939 --> 10:49.857
They say that?

10:50.149 --> 10:52.193
You know those are really spicy, right?

10:52.276 --> 10:55.196
Too many of those
can mess with the old plumbing.

10:55.279 --> 10:59.075
Ms. Nowhere, eating spicy food
is part of my heritage.

10:59.158 --> 11:02.119
I can handle. [chuckles, munches]

11:02.995 --> 11:05.373
-[gulps, whimpers]
-[stomach gurgles]

11:05.456 --> 11:06.415
[whispers] Hot?

11:07.416 --> 11:08.292
[falteringly] No...

11:08.376 --> 11:11.545
-[tense music plays]
-Really? Not even a little?

11:11.629 --> 11:13.005
[gasps] Not even a little.

11:13.506 --> 11:14.590
Well then, here.

11:14.674 --> 11:17.259
Why don't you have another?
Or have a few more.

11:18.010 --> 11:19.470
I would love to.

11:20.763 --> 11:23.849
-[groans]
-[stomach gurgles]

11:23.933 --> 11:26.852
I just, uh...
I just need to go... [retches]

11:26.936 --> 11:28.062
Go stretch!

11:28.729 --> 11:30.731
[roaring]

11:32.108 --> 11:34.819
[lively, rhythmic music plays]

11:35.986 --> 11:36.821
Oh, no.

11:37.238 --> 11:38.406
[Layla] Not these two.

11:39.532 --> 11:41.951
Nacho and Rollie!
How you been since SH1FT3R?

11:42.034 --> 11:44.495
I was passing through town
and dropped by for some fun.

11:44.578 --> 11:47.123
Look who it is! The snitch.

11:47.206 --> 11:48.874
Oh, so that's how it's gonna be?

11:48.958 --> 11:51.877
That's how you made it,
so that's how it is.

11:51.961 --> 11:54.380
I didn't come here to argue,
I came here to race.

11:54.463 --> 11:55.756
You got a spot available?

11:56.132 --> 11:58.759
Maybe. You got enough for the cash buy-in?

11:58.843 --> 12:02.430
And you're gonna need a food truck
for the demolition derby.

12:03.889 --> 12:05.891
No way! Is that a 'copter?

12:06.392 --> 12:09.061
[laughs] I always wanted one of those!

12:09.478 --> 12:13.482
Dude, no one calls a helicopter a 'copter.
They're choppers.

12:13.566 --> 12:15.818
Hey, look,
I call 'em whatever I want, okay?

12:16.569 --> 12:19.071
-Leverage.
-Hey, why don't we make a trade?

12:19.155 --> 12:21.991
Our 'copter-chopper
for the truck and the buy-in.

12:22.074 --> 12:24.243
[music intensifies]

12:24.326 --> 12:27.246
[banging, echoing]

12:27.663 --> 12:29.874
They stuck us with
the bottom of the barrel.

12:29.957 --> 12:31.667
Tires are bald, transmission's shot.

12:31.750 --> 12:32.960
The body's rotted through.

12:33.377 --> 12:36.297
-It looks like we need to-- [groans]
-[stomach gurgles]

12:36.380 --> 12:37.840
Chili problems?

12:38.257 --> 12:42.303
[scoffs] Opposite!
I'm just still really hungry.

12:42.386 --> 12:45.723
[Ms. Nowhere] Good thing
I have this left over from lunch.

12:45.806 --> 12:46.932
[groans]

12:47.016 --> 12:47.933
[crowd cheers]

12:48.017 --> 12:51.520
Listen up! It's race time,
which means it's rule time,

12:51.604 --> 12:54.148
which means it's listen time. [exclaims]

12:54.231 --> 12:58.194
We got five teams of four,
competing in three different races.

12:58.277 --> 13:00.029
Five, four, three.

13:00.112 --> 13:01.405
Pretty simple, right?

13:01.489 --> 13:04.700
[grunts] But now we gotta throw
an eight in there. A figure eight!

13:05.034 --> 13:06.827
Which is one of the races!

13:06.911 --> 13:09.955
[Nacho] The figure eight race
will have two cars from each team.

13:10.039 --> 13:13.334
There's also a quarter-mile sprint
with one car from each team.

13:13.417 --> 13:14.543
Hey, am I...

13:14.627 --> 13:15.961
Am I missing anything?

13:16.045 --> 13:18.881
Ay! The food truck demolition derby, fool!

13:18.964 --> 13:23.385
It's the last event, and the final driver
from each team will compete.

13:23.469 --> 13:26.138
[grunts] Each car
must be driven by a different driver.

13:26.472 --> 13:29.517
No switchies, no tag teamsies,
none of that stuff.

13:29.600 --> 13:33.395
The winning team of the whole event
gets the cash pot.

13:33.479 --> 13:37.858
But to keep things exciting,
we get every car that doesn't win.

13:37.942 --> 13:40.569
Did he say they take all our cars?

13:40.653 --> 13:41.487
Let's do this!

13:41.570 --> 13:42.863
[lights hum]

13:42.947 --> 13:45.866
-[crowd cheers]
-[engines roar]

13:47.159 --> 13:51.121
Uh... I don't think there's enough room
on this track for all the cars.

13:51.205 --> 13:52.039
[Cisco] Whoa.

13:52.122 --> 13:54.208
[engines rev]

13:59.129 --> 14:02.591
Nowhere and Frostee, you get that list
for Manny while the rest of us race.

14:02.675 --> 14:03.592
[Frostee] Copy that.

14:03.676 --> 14:06.178
-[Ms. Nowhere] Don't tell me what to do.
-[sighs]

14:06.262 --> 14:08.931
Don't worry, Toretto.
I'll give you a ride once you lose.

14:09.265 --> 14:11.642
No, you're gonna lose your car.

14:11.725 --> 14:14.103
[start signal beeps]

14:14.645 --> 14:15.729
[tires squeal]

14:16.772 --> 14:19.483
[rhythmic music plays]

14:25.781 --> 14:26.615
[grunting]

14:29.618 --> 14:30.870
[crowd roars]

14:35.916 --> 14:36.917
[Layla exclaims]

14:45.885 --> 14:46.844
Watch out!

14:54.101 --> 14:55.102
[grunts]

15:00.274 --> 15:02.818
Two cars out of the race
and it's just the first lap.

15:02.902 --> 15:03.861
That was a close one!

15:05.696 --> 15:08.282
[Ms. Nowhere] The list Manny wants
must be locked inside.

15:08.365 --> 15:10.576
It's the only secure location around.

15:10.951 --> 15:13.621
Are there any other security measures
we need to note?

15:13.704 --> 15:15.831
Uh... That guy.

15:15.915 --> 15:18.459
-[panting, sniffing]
-[tense music plays]

15:20.210 --> 15:22.546
A vicious killing machine.

15:22.630 --> 15:25.507
Why couldn't it be
a laser array or some ninjas?

15:26.008 --> 15:28.302
[yelps softly]

15:28.802 --> 15:31.805
-Seems pretty friendly to me.
-That's what he wants you to think.

15:31.889 --> 15:33.849
We have to scale the fence
and reach the van

15:33.933 --> 15:36.852
before that mangy beast
gets anywhere near us.

15:36.936 --> 15:39.104
[rhythmic music plays]

15:47.321 --> 15:49.615
Bro, if you and Layla both lose,

15:49.698 --> 15:52.034
we won't have your cars
or a shot at the pot,

15:52.117 --> 15:54.244
and we'll be stuck here
with Nacho and Rollie!

15:54.328 --> 15:56.497
-[stomach gurgles]
-[whimpers] Aw, man.

15:56.580 --> 15:58.499
[Cisco] We got any antacid in the hauler?

16:12.805 --> 16:14.765
[crowd roars]

16:14.848 --> 16:16.600
[Rollie] The winner!

16:17.309 --> 16:18.811
The winner!

16:18.894 --> 16:20.521
-[Tony yelps]
-Ay, it was Tony!

16:20.604 --> 16:22.064
No, Layla won.

16:22.147 --> 16:25.526
You just want Tony to win
because you're in love with him!

16:25.609 --> 16:26.443
[Tony gasps]

16:26.902 --> 16:29.530
You just want Layla to win
because you love her.

16:30.906 --> 16:34.118
Hey, you can't just flip my burn around
and use it on me!

16:34.201 --> 16:36.745
[sighs] Okay, I know.

16:36.829 --> 16:39.081
We can take both their cars.

16:39.164 --> 16:41.041
Or, how about this?

16:41.125 --> 16:45.212
If my team wins the whole race,
we keep all the cars and the cash pot.

16:45.295 --> 16:48.424
If not, we'll give up
all the cars and the hauler.

16:48.507 --> 16:49.967
Pfft. That's stupid.

16:50.050 --> 16:51.802
-We're in.
-[tense music plays]

16:51.885 --> 16:54.680
That is stupid!
How did you just make everything worse?

16:54.763 --> 16:58.183
The only way to win a race with crazies
is to out-crazy them!

16:58.267 --> 17:02.021
[groaning] Uh... I don't know
if I'll be able to drive, you guys.

17:02.104 --> 17:05.399
-[exclaims, groans]
-[stomach gurgles]

17:05.482 --> 17:06.984
So, in the next two hours,

17:07.067 --> 17:09.194
the gas master has to win
the food truck derby

17:09.278 --> 17:11.113
and we have to get the list to Manny,

17:11.196 --> 17:13.407
or we're busted
with no rides and no money.

17:13.490 --> 17:16.452
Hey! No problem. I trust my family to win.

17:16.535 --> 17:18.829
-[dog barks]
-[tense music plays]

17:18.912 --> 17:22.833
We just need to get over the fence
without agitating Cerberus.

17:22.916 --> 17:24.376
-Uh, Ms. Nowhere?
-[grunts]

17:24.960 --> 17:26.795
-[barking]
-He's attacking me!

17:26.879 --> 17:28.088
[shrieking]

17:28.172 --> 17:30.090
-Uh... [grunts]
-[Ms. Nowhere shrieks]

17:30.174 --> 17:31.175
[shrieking continues]

17:31.258 --> 17:33.260
He's attacking you with kisses.

17:33.343 --> 17:36.013
Get him off of me!

17:36.096 --> 17:37.639
[shrieking]

17:38.057 --> 17:39.558
Aw, he's harmless!

17:39.641 --> 17:41.852
-Look at his cute little face!
-[barks]

17:41.935 --> 17:46.607
[gasps] Aw! It says his name is Roscoe.

17:46.690 --> 17:48.609
-Roscoe!
-[sighs]

17:48.692 --> 17:51.862
It's a trap!
He's clearly there for protection.

17:51.945 --> 17:53.822
Or maybe he just wants to play.

17:53.906 --> 17:57.284
You wouldn't play with a security system,
would you?

17:57.367 --> 17:59.787
I guess you didn't grow up with pets.

17:59.870 --> 18:03.624
You handle that monstrosity while
I work on getting the list from the van.

18:04.124 --> 18:05.834
Uh, what are you doing?

18:05.918 --> 18:07.795
Checking for booby traps.

18:07.878 --> 18:10.506
[suspenseful music plays]

18:11.006 --> 18:13.801
Maybe Nacho and Rollie
are just as dumb as they seem.

18:13.884 --> 18:15.969
That's what they want you to think.

18:16.053 --> 18:18.597
I'm not sure people
want you to think things

18:18.680 --> 18:21.558
as much as you think
they want you to think things.

18:22.434 --> 18:26.188
Okay, who's ready for
the rules for race number two?

18:26.271 --> 18:28.565
Isn't it a sprint,
first to the finish line wins?

18:28.857 --> 18:31.151
[Rollie] First to the finish line wins!

18:31.235 --> 18:34.947
[laughs] Nice golf cart!

18:35.030 --> 18:38.826
Hope you got an extension cord
that reaches to the end of the track.

18:38.909 --> 18:40.494
-Woohoo!
-Yeah!

18:40.577 --> 18:42.204

[chuckles]

18:52.422 --> 18:54.007
[Echo] Yeah! Take that!

18:54.091 --> 18:55.717
Whoo! Yeah!

18:55.801 --> 18:56.802
Huh?

18:58.262 --> 19:01.557
Now we just need Cisco
to win the demolition derby. Easy.

19:04.101 --> 19:06.937
-[groaning] I don't think it's gonna hold.
-[stomach gurgles]

19:07.020 --> 19:08.647
This truck will be fine.

19:08.730 --> 19:11.400
-I was talking about my stomach!
-[gurgling continues]

19:11.483 --> 19:12.776
You got this, buddy.

19:12.860 --> 19:16.363
All you got to do is ram 'em,
then smash 'em, then ram 'em some more,

19:16.446 --> 19:18.157
until you're the last one standing.

19:18.240 --> 19:19.825
[Cisco] Aw...

19:21.910 --> 19:26.748
Ugh! Ew! Is that a jar
of toenail clippings labeled "lucky"?

19:26.832 --> 19:27.958
[coughs]

19:28.041 --> 19:30.335
I think Rollie and Nacho may live here.

19:32.087 --> 19:35.549

You're about to see a master at work.

but I'm afraid to let go!

I told you they were
smarter than they looked!

-[barks]
-[shrieks] I thought you were on lookout?

I think I see why
you didn't hear a lock clicking.

-Okay...

20:34.149 --> 20:35.484
[Ms. Nowhere] They're idiots.

20:36.151 --> 20:40.364
[sighs] Okay. We've done our part.
Now it's all up to Cisco.

20:40.864 --> 20:42.783
[Cisco groans] Okay, one truck left.

20:43.283 --> 20:46.245
One truck. Take this out,
then run to the bathroom.

we take all your cars!
