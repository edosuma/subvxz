WEBVTT

00:01.460 --> 00:03.799
<i>In May of 2009,
I was on the verge of scoring</i>

00:03.924 --> 00:06.580
<i>my first big client
as an independent architect.</i>

00:06.705 --> 00:08.790
<i>I was willing to do anything
to make it happen.</i>

00:09.143 --> 00:11.846
Here's what we want, son.
It's real simple.

00:12.108 --> 00:14.255
We're opening a restaurant
called Rib Town

00:14.667 --> 00:16.623
and we want it to be shaped

00:16.848 --> 00:18.475
like a cowboy hat.

00:19.503 --> 00:20.504
<i>Anything.</i>

00:20.776 --> 00:21.731
A cowboy hat?

00:22.818 --> 00:24.170
That's brilliant.

00:24.496 --> 00:25.356
I love it!

00:25.481 --> 00:28.661
I mean, nothing says delicious
like the inside of a cowboy hat, right?

00:29.019 --> 00:31.046
Look, I'm telling you, I'm your guy.

00:32.628 --> 00:35.150
I think I was born
to design this building.

00:35.275 --> 00:36.154
I just...

00:36.588 --> 00:37.481
I see it.

00:37.805 --> 00:40.852
I don't see it. I don't see it.
I don't see it.

00:41.981 --> 00:43.440
What's so good about it?

00:43.981 --> 00:44.859
Up all night?

00:45.028 --> 00:47.248
I told these guys
I have a vision for this thing.

00:47.373 --> 00:49.789
They want to see a pitch
in a week and I got nothing.

00:50.204 --> 00:51.999
- It's cute.
- Cute?

00:53.330 --> 00:56.507
I could be designing concert halls
and bridges.

00:56.675 --> 00:59.554
Bridges so beautiful
they could be in museums.

00:59.679 --> 01:02.059
And I could design those museums.

01:02.568 --> 01:05.588
But what am I designing instead?
What has my career come to?

01:05.714 --> 01:09.603
A two-story Stetson
with outdoor dining on the brim.

01:10.681 --> 01:12.650
It's a sick cosmic joke.

01:12.774 --> 01:14.626
The universe
is conspiring against me.

01:15.604 --> 01:18.569
You just need to get out of the house.
Take a walk. Get a bagel.

01:19.551 --> 01:21.250
Yeah, that'll solve everything.

01:21.375 --> 01:24.188
I haven't slept for 34 hours,
but a bagel is the answer.

01:24.313 --> 01:27.275
A cinnamon raisin bagel
with a little cream cheese.

01:28.066 --> 01:30.113
That sounds pretty good,
I'm going to get a bagel.

01:30.672 --> 01:32.451
Bring an umbrella.
It's supposed to rain,

01:32.577 --> 01:34.289
according to Galoshes,
our weather clown.

01:34.457 --> 01:36.799
Your show has a clown
who does the weather?

01:36.924 --> 01:38.389
That's a little cheesy, no?

01:39.299 --> 01:42.953
And what's that restaurant
you're designing shaped like, Hoss?

01:44.306 --> 01:45.973
Fine.
You want me out of the house,

01:46.098 --> 01:47.773
I'll get out of the house.

01:47.942 --> 01:51.796
Can't wait to see what the universe
has lined up for me out there.

01:56.248 --> 01:59.306
<i>Kids, I've been telling you
the story of how I met your mother.</i>

01:59.431 --> 02:01.799
<i>And while there's many things
to learn from this story,</i>

02:01.924 --> 02:03.625
<i>this may be the biggest.</i>

02:03.953 --> 02:07.395
<i>The great moments of your life
won't necessarily be the things you do.</i>

02:07.520 --> 02:10.199
<i>They'll also be the things
that happen to you.</i>

02:10.326 --> 02:13.407
<i>I'm not saying you can't take action
to affect the outcome of your life.</i>

02:14.075 --> 02:16.527
<i>You have to take action,
and you will.</i>

02:17.505 --> 02:19.670
<i>But never forget that, on any day,</i>

02:19.795 --> 02:23.287
<i>you could step out the front door
and your whole life can change forever.</i>

02:24.156 --> 02:26.486
<i>You see,
the universe has a plan, kids,</i>

02:26.611 --> 02:28.560
<i>and that plan is always in motion.</i>

02:29.659 --> 02:31.657
<i>A butterfly flaps its wings...</i>

02:32.499 --> 02:34.251
<i>and it starts to rain.</i>

02:34.876 --> 02:37.732
<i>It's a scary thought.
But it's also kind of wonderful.</i>

02:37.992 --> 02:40.995
<i>All these little parts of the machine
constantly working,</i>

02:41.120 --> 02:43.951
<i>making sure that you end up
exactly where you're supposed to be,</i>

02:44.077 --> 02:46.249
<i>exactly when you're supposed
to be there.</i>

02:46.524 --> 02:49.182
<i>The right place...
at the right time.</i>

<i>Kids, it's a miracle
that I ended up on that street corner.</i>

03:09.447 --> 03:12.396
<i>Especially when you consider how easy
it would have been not to end up there.</i>

03:13.050 --> 03:15.068
<i>I mean, when I first
stepped out of the apartment,</i>

03:15.236 --> 03:17.419
<i>I almost went right instead of left.</i>

03:17.544 --> 03:18.805
<i>Why didn't I go right?</i>

03:18.930 --> 03:20.871
<i>To answer that,
we have to go back a few days.</i>

03:21.512 --> 03:24.294
<i>As you know, back then,
your Aunt Robin hosted a morning show.</i>

03:24.744 --> 03:27.835
Now Eunice here
makes all of these purses herself.

03:28.195 --> 03:30.829
They're hand embroidered
with the world's finest silk.

03:30.955 --> 03:33.289
And each one takes months to make.

03:33.414 --> 03:36.505
I cannot emphasize
how much work goes into...

03:40.649 --> 03:42.120
Go to weather, you idiot.

03:44.265 --> 03:45.569
Hey, everybody.

03:45.694 --> 03:48.466
We got a high pressure system
coming in from the west and...

03:51.186 --> 03:54.450
On the plus side,
I bought the cutest purse today.

03:55.115 --> 03:56.815
So, wait, why did you throw up?

03:57.668 --> 03:59.821
- You don't want to know.
- Come on. Tell me.

04:01.250 --> 04:02.243
I'm pregnant.

04:02.836 --> 04:05.664
I will raise this child with you.
You are not alone in this.

04:05.789 --> 04:08.586
We can even get married if you want,
but I still want to see other girls,

04:08.712 --> 04:11.168
- it would've to be one of those kind...
- God, stop it.

04:11.293 --> 04:13.682
I'm not pregnant.
It's food poisoning.

04:15.352 --> 04:17.430
I ate something from this place,

04:17.555 --> 04:21.196
and three hours later,
I was spewing like an open hydrant.

04:21.462 --> 04:24.787
- God. From where?
- Well, that's a gross question.

04:24.955 --> 04:26.582
No, where was the food from?

04:28.485 --> 04:30.046
- I don't want to tell you.
- What?

04:30.623 --> 04:33.246
Go to YouTube. Put in
"Robin Scherbatsky morning show vomit"

04:33.371 --> 04:34.764
Robin, home so soon.

04:35.660 --> 04:37.436
Someone already put it on YouTube?

04:37.899 --> 04:39.461
Yeah... Someone.

04:41.570 --> 04:43.740
So...
Why you been throwing up? You pregnant?

04:43.908 --> 04:45.744
Yeah, Barney. I'm pregnant.

04:50.499 --> 04:52.841
So, wait, why won't you tell me
where you got food poisoning?

04:53.009 --> 04:56.097
You love this place.
If I tell you, it'll just ruin it.

04:57.878 --> 04:59.658
- That makes sense.
- Yeah.

04:59.783 --> 05:01.035
Don't tell me.

05:01.777 --> 05:04.113
Is it that Indian place where the cat
jumps on all the tables?

05:04.281 --> 05:05.244
I'm not saying.

05:05.369 --> 05:08.474
- That Spanish place with baby's crib?
- I'm not saying.

05:09.437 --> 05:10.292
God, no.

05:12.807 --> 05:15.134
Is it this place?
Tell me, damn you!

05:15.302 --> 05:17.504
- You really want to know?
- Yes!

05:17.966 --> 05:20.020
It's Schlegel's Bagels.

05:20.146 --> 05:21.897
Why did you tell me that?

05:22.450 --> 05:25.231
Schlegel's?
Thanks a lot, Robin.

05:25.711 --> 05:27.874
Now I'm gonna have to try to find
another place in NY

05:27.999 --> 05:29.537
that serves bagels.

05:31.668 --> 05:34.459
<i>So, you see, kids, if I had gone
to Schlegel's Bagels as usual,</i>

05:34.584 --> 05:36.216
<i>I would have taken a right.</i>

05:36.960 --> 05:38.755
<i>I would have gotten a bagel...</i>

05:38.880 --> 05:40.977
<i>gone home,
worked on the old hat building,</i>

05:41.473 --> 05:43.606
<i>and you kids
might never have been born.</i>

05:44.143 --> 05:47.997
<i>But I turned left instead, to go
to my second-favorite bagel place</i>

05:48.477 --> 05:50.179
<i>and the rest is history.</i>

05:50.431 --> 05:53.433
<i>Of course, I stopped
at that magazine stand on the way.</i>

05:53.650 --> 05:56.046
<i>Why did I stop there?
Here's why.</i>

06:02.226 --> 06:03.677
<i>Bro's Life magazine.</i>

06:04.447 --> 06:06.426
Page 83.
Check it.

06:08.080 --> 06:10.778
"What your paintball gun says
about your personality"?

06:10.904 --> 06:11.786
Below that.

06:12.363 --> 06:15.000
"That last five pounds:
How to get her to lose them."

06:15.168 --> 06:16.420
Above that.

06:17.106 --> 06:18.758
Petra Petrova.

06:20.861 --> 06:24.560
<i>Bro's Life magazine's
girl of the year for may.</i>

06:24.933 --> 06:27.831
A delicate flower in stiletto pumps
and leopard panties,

06:27.956 --> 06:29.277
straddling an ATV.

06:29.446 --> 06:32.451
These magazines are so lame. I mean,
she's probably airbrushed and enhanced.

06:32.619 --> 06:35.692
- I have a date with her.
- You are my hero! Are you serious?

06:35.817 --> 06:38.485
- How do you have a date with her?
- Not part of the story.

06:38.611 --> 06:41.610
Ted, I have been waiting
a long time to say this.

06:42.348 --> 06:44.370
This girl is the one.

06:44.685 --> 06:46.870
Of course she's the one.
You have to marry those.

06:46.996 --> 06:47.997
Her.

06:49.311 --> 06:50.312
Marry?

06:52.250 --> 06:55.580
I have something much,
much more special in mind.

06:56.255 --> 06:58.409
Petra here, if all goes well,

06:58.618 --> 07:00.805
will be my...
wait for it, two hundredth.

07:00.930 --> 07:02.676
Sorry, I couldn't wait.
It's all exciting.

07:03.015 --> 07:05.849
Your two hundredth,
as in "sex with"?

07:06.017 --> 07:07.539
As in "sex with."

07:07.664 --> 07:10.442
I request the highest of fives.

07:10.948 --> 07:13.322
Not if I was wearing a HazMat suit.

07:14.352 --> 07:15.840
200 is too many.

07:16.525 --> 07:20.511
Right, 'cause there can be
too many of something wonderful.

07:20.636 --> 07:23.634
"Babe Ruth, easy, big fella.
Let's not hit too many homers."

07:24.637 --> 07:27.752
"Steve Guttenberg, maybe just make
three Police Academy movies.

07:27.877 --> 07:29.520
"America's laughed enough."

07:29.757 --> 07:31.065
Who are these girls?

07:31.496 --> 07:33.444
That was rhetorical.
Don't show me the list.

07:33.612 --> 07:36.700
199 satisfied customers.

07:36.969 --> 07:39.205
Anyway, the big night is Thursday.

07:39.465 --> 07:42.252
I'm having a celebratory soirée
beforehand at MacLaren's.

07:42.959 --> 07:45.991
Prepare a toast.
Black tie optional, but preferred.

07:46.116 --> 07:49.454
Gifts are, look, I would say
unnecessary, but follow your heart.

07:49.937 --> 07:51.104
200's too many.

07:51.272 --> 07:53.108
- It's not too many.
- It's too many!

07:53.351 --> 07:55.404
- It's not too many.
- Thank you.

07:55.572 --> 07:56.817
No, don't get me wrong.

07:56.943 --> 08:00.539
You're disgusting, and the cops should
probably clamp a boot on your genitals,

08:00.707 --> 08:02.900
but that number should be higher.

08:03.025 --> 08:05.922
After Barney told me about all this,
I crunched the numbers and,

08:06.047 --> 08:07.048
well...

08:07.261 --> 08:08.638
I had some charts made up.

08:10.646 --> 08:13.147
Barney here
hits on roughly 20 girls a week.

08:13.634 --> 08:17.388
It's way more than 20.
And B. Smooth don't do nothing roughly.

08:18.533 --> 08:20.614
Let's say 20.
So, 20 girls a week means

08:20.739 --> 08:23.249
1,040 girls a year.

08:23.417 --> 08:26.094
In Barney's 16 years
of sexual activity,

08:26.220 --> 08:30.221
that means he's hit on 16,640 girls.

08:30.591 --> 08:33.270
Now, if he's bedded 199 of them,

08:33.395 --> 08:35.297
that is a success rate of...

08:37.052 --> 08:40.365
a little over one percent.

08:41.087 --> 08:43.205
That's a batting average of 12,

08:43.373 --> 08:46.717
eight times worse than
the career batting average of...

08:47.075 --> 08:49.255
one-handed pitcher, that's right,

08:49.785 --> 08:51.551
pitcher... Jim Abbott.

08:54.464 --> 08:55.228
Jealous.

08:55.761 --> 08:56.523
Jealous.

08:57.014 --> 08:57.900
Hero.

08:58.388 --> 09:00.443
Suspiciously quiet
during this conversation

09:00.568 --> 09:03.202
about number of sex partners. Hero.

09:03.555 --> 09:06.416
It's the grand total.
That's the only number that matters.

09:06.584 --> 09:08.636
- Says who?
- Matthew Panning,

09:09.206 --> 09:11.885
the stud of Port Richmond
Middle School.

09:12.263 --> 09:14.478
Stinson, you're such a dweeb-o.

09:14.604 --> 09:16.394
I bet you never
even done it with a girl.

09:16.562 --> 09:17.964
Neither have you.

09:18.089 --> 09:20.337
How many times do I have
to explain this?

09:20.462 --> 09:21.949
I've done it with 100 girls.

09:22.074 --> 09:24.578
They're seventh graders
at my cousin's school on Long Island.

09:25.004 --> 09:28.292
Well, you know what, Matthew?
Someday, I'm gonna do it with 200.

09:30.159 --> 09:32.091
Yeah.
Call me when that happens.

09:33.763 --> 09:35.843
And call him I will.

09:36.917 --> 09:39.230
I think he's gonna say it again
really slow.

09:39.944 --> 09:41.446
Call him...

09:42.600 --> 09:43.719
I will.

09:45.827 --> 09:49.296
You listed Gaby Allan twice,
as 78 and 162.

09:49.421 --> 09:51.244
What? Let me see.

09:51.369 --> 09:52.421
Seventy...

09:52.741 --> 09:54.262
Once. Oh, my God.

09:55.332 --> 09:57.511
Wait a...
I counted the same girl twice?

09:57.637 --> 09:59.938
That means I'm only at one 198?

10:00.106 --> 10:03.896
That only means that you're half
a percent less gross than we thought.

10:04.372 --> 10:07.202
I'm seducing
a Czech supermodel in two hours.

10:07.327 --> 10:09.620
I can't squander that on 199.

10:11.561 --> 10:13.768
Petra has to be 200.

10:14.049 --> 10:16.470
What are you gonna do? It's not
like you're gonna find someone new

10:16.595 --> 10:18.784
to have sex with
in the next two hours.

10:19.106 --> 10:21.249
Hi, millionaire astronaut.
Want to come back to my place

10:21.374 --> 10:22.995
- and see some moon shells?
- Go away.

10:23.120 --> 10:26.231
I just got back from my wife's grave.
Put her in the ground a year ago today.

10:26.356 --> 10:28.241
Man, I miss her.
I sure could use some comfort.

10:28.456 --> 10:29.577
You're creepy.

10:29.745 --> 10:32.462
Man, aren't you sick of all the games?
I just want to settle down

10:32.587 --> 10:34.775
and have a gaggle
of rug rats, like, right now.

10:34.900 --> 10:37.507
I have Mace, and I enjoy using it.

10:41.534 --> 10:44.664
Knowing how important this is to me,
do you think Lily would even consider...

10:44.789 --> 10:47.154
- By the way, I would do all the work...
- I will end your life.

10:47.323 --> 10:48.124
Right.

10:53.860 --> 10:55.920
Where'd Barney go?
It's been over an hour.

10:56.090 --> 10:58.301
You know,
looking over the names on this list,

10:58.427 --> 11:00.932
I'm not sensing a lot
of ethnic diversity.

11:01.057 --> 11:03.018
He should really look
at that in himself.

11:06.377 --> 11:07.443
All done.

11:07.816 --> 11:10.068
199 down, one more to go.

11:10.193 --> 11:11.814
You done with your drink?

11:14.304 --> 11:15.677
There's the stuff.

11:17.577 --> 11:19.329
What the hell happened to you?

11:19.454 --> 11:21.839
So, there's this girl at my gym...

11:22.109 --> 11:24.560
Pauline... she's been
after me for some time.

11:24.773 --> 11:27.732
- Why'd you wait until now?
- She's not exactly my type.

11:28.303 --> 11:30.154
Looking good, Pauline.

11:30.322 --> 11:31.591
You are gonna rip it up

11:31.716 --> 11:34.927
at the Women's Pumping Iron
Classic in Sarasota this fall.

11:40.496 --> 11:43.072
I was thinking about you and me

11:44.494 --> 11:47.022
and if you're still interested...

11:47.856 --> 11:51.446
- Okay, blondie, time for Mama's cardio!
- Geez! Mommy!

11:52.166 --> 11:53.243
Every inch of her

11:53.368 --> 11:55.542
tasted like roast beef and creatine.

11:57.960 --> 11:59.111
But I did it.

11:59.313 --> 12:02.565
I did it and I still have 30 minutes
before I'm supposed to meet Petra.

12:02.690 --> 12:04.547
Robin, do you have
any concealer handy?

12:04.672 --> 12:07.225
I'd really like to cover up
some bruises and razor burn.

12:10.036 --> 12:12.777
- I hate to break this to you, but...
- What?

12:13.205 --> 12:16.208
Well, you did count
Gaby Allan twice,

12:16.333 --> 12:20.324
but... you also went
from 138 to 138.

12:20.449 --> 12:21.837
You used the same number twice.

12:22.501 --> 12:23.760
Wait, so, that means...

12:24.352 --> 12:27.007
Pauline wasn't 199, Pauline was 200?

12:27.592 --> 12:28.726
Congratulations!

12:29.855 --> 12:32.052
No... That was supposed to be Petra!

12:32.178 --> 12:33.959
Petra was supposed to be 200!

12:34.363 --> 12:37.609
Gorgeous, feminine, "Doesn't wear
a weight belt in bed," Petra!

12:37.787 --> 12:40.434
Hey, come on.
You made it to 200.

12:40.875 --> 12:42.112
You should be proud.

12:42.365 --> 12:45.049
You should be tested,
but you should be proud.

12:45.554 --> 12:48.515
Who cares if Pauline doesn't
pose for bikini pictures in magazines?

12:48.931 --> 12:50.062
Actually, she does.

12:50.187 --> 12:53.023
<i>She's gonna be in next week's
issue of Muscle Sexxy.</i>

12:53.190 --> 12:55.440
And like many of the ladies
in that magazine,

12:55.565 --> 12:57.850
Sexxy has two X's and one Y.

13:00.636 --> 13:02.389
<i>And so, on my way to get a bagel,</i>

13:02.514 --> 13:04.516
<i>I stopped at a newsstand
for a full minute</i>

13:04.641 --> 13:06.904
<i>to check out a picture
of Barney's 200th.</i>

13:08.709 --> 13:09.848
<i>If I hadn't done that,</i>

13:10.020 --> 13:11.934
<i>I would've walked right
by the newsstand,</i>

13:12.103 --> 13:15.064
<i>cut down 77th and gotten to
that corner a minute early.</i>

13:15.340 --> 13:17.825
<i>I would've gotten the bagel,
done some work,</i>

13:18.449 --> 13:20.326
<i>and you kids might
never have been born.</i>

13:20.659 --> 13:22.333
<i>Now, why did I cut down 77th,</i>

13:22.623 --> 13:25.275
<i>and give a dollar to the homeless guy?
Here's why.</i>

13:25.415 --> 13:28.215
<i>Back when Marshall first started working
at Goliath National Bank...</i>

13:30.187 --> 13:33.483
Fran, I don't mean to bother you
but I have a big presentation tomorrow

13:33.608 --> 13:37.165
and it would really help if I could get
like some charts and graphs made up.

13:37.302 --> 13:40.256
- Could you help me with that?
- This is the graphics department.

13:40.381 --> 13:43.039
We can make as many graphs,
as many charts in as many colors

13:43.164 --> 13:45.029
on as many kinds
of paper as you want.

13:52.069 --> 13:53.921
We are gonna have some fun.

13:54.268 --> 13:57.732
I've ranked the Presidents
in order of how dirty their names sound.

13:58.221 --> 13:59.838
One: Johnson.

14:00.187 --> 14:01.739
Two: Bush.

14:02.130 --> 14:03.773
Three: Harding.

14:03.898 --> 14:05.497
Four: Polk.

14:06.995 --> 14:10.757
This circle represents
"People Who Are Breaking My Heart..."

14:11.415 --> 14:13.531
and this circle represents

14:13.657 --> 14:16.528
"People Who Are Shaking
My Confidence Daily."

14:17.162 --> 14:18.698
And where they overlap:

14:19.849 --> 14:20.850
Cecilia.

14:23.480 --> 14:26.662
This is a pie chart
describing my favorite bars.

14:29.921 --> 14:33.169
And this is a bar graph
describing my favorite pies.

14:40.500 --> 14:41.567
What's going on?

14:41.736 --> 14:43.007
Enough with the charts.

14:43.132 --> 14:44.383
And the graphs.

14:44.759 --> 14:47.662
Really any visual
representation of data.

14:49.135 --> 14:50.451
I'm not an idiot.

14:52.326 --> 14:55.371
I know how you guys feel
about my charts and my graphs.

14:55.895 --> 14:58.585
As a matter of fact, I've made a chart
of your reaction to my charts.

14:58.710 --> 15:01.258
Let's take a look.
Yes, it is true,

15:01.649 --> 15:03.665
since Cecelia,
your interest in my charts

15:03.790 --> 15:05.342
has been steadily dropping.

15:05.467 --> 15:07.451
But based on recent trends,

15:07.576 --> 15:08.972
I have also made...

15:09.827 --> 15:11.542
A projection chart!

15:11.711 --> 15:14.292
And look...
huge spike in interest coming!

15:14.418 --> 15:16.769
And this isn't just
some dead cat bounce.

15:16.893 --> 15:20.267
This is big sustainable growth
over the long term.

15:20.436 --> 15:22.312
You're a big sustainable growth.

15:25.653 --> 15:28.186
So, I have prepared a few charts

15:28.618 --> 15:32.222
to demonstrate how setting up
a shell corporation in Bermuda

15:32.347 --> 15:34.545
could help minimize
our second quarter losses.

15:36.028 --> 15:37.467
And save you all some jail time.

15:39.273 --> 15:40.686
To begin with...

15:45.843 --> 15:47.761
Could you just please excuse me?

15:52.901 --> 15:55.461
- Mosbius Designs.
- What the hell happened to my charts?

15:55.630 --> 15:57.464
- We threw them away.
- What?

15:57.716 --> 15:59.332
That's how an intervention works.

15:59.457 --> 16:02.098
You wouldn't stop using,
so, we flushed your stash.

16:02.267 --> 16:03.410
Come on, Ted!

16:03.536 --> 16:04.789
I need my charts, man!

16:04.914 --> 16:07.664
Just for today and then I promise
I will never ever use charts again.

16:07.789 --> 16:10.405
I'm under at lot of pressure here.
I need my charts, Jack!

16:10.862 --> 16:13.119
My God, you're doing charts at work?

16:13.485 --> 16:16.454
They're for work, you idiot!
I'm giving a big presentation right now

16:16.579 --> 16:18.630
and if I don't have
those charts I'm gonna get fired!

16:19.598 --> 16:20.600
Crap.

16:20.927 --> 16:22.806
Stay right there.
I'll bring them to you.

16:22.974 --> 16:25.474
Hurry up! I'll try to think
of a way to stall them.

16:28.670 --> 16:30.867
I'm sorry but there's been
a little delay with the charts.

16:30.992 --> 16:34.003
But we will get started
in just a minute.

16:40.455 --> 16:41.925
Fish are weird, right?

16:42.835 --> 16:44.936
I mean what's up with fish?

16:51.042 --> 16:52.947
Charts! Get your charts here!

16:56.640 --> 16:59.460
Excuse me, Milt?
I think those are my charts.

17:00.289 --> 17:02.306
These charts?
On my blanket?

17:02.969 --> 17:05.422
That's also my blanket.
We'll get to that later.

17:05.547 --> 17:08.737
- But I really need these charts.
- Good, 'cause they're for sale.

17:09.271 --> 17:10.482
Fine, how much?

17:11.973 --> 17:13.069
One million dollars.

17:14.181 --> 17:16.409
- I'll give you five bucks.
- A million dollars.

17:17.119 --> 17:19.582
No one's gonna pay
a million dollars for these charts!

17:20.751 --> 17:22.213
One million dollars.

17:22.382 --> 17:23.883
Okay, Milt, you win.

17:25.332 --> 17:27.262
I'm gonna give you
one million dollars.

17:28.226 --> 17:29.425
Urinating...

17:29.928 --> 17:31.605
The problem is, the ATM...

17:31.774 --> 17:33.275
The alien time machine.

17:33.641 --> 17:37.081
The alien time machine
has a withdrawal limit.

17:37.206 --> 17:40.232
So, here's what I'm gonna do.
I'm gonna give you one dollar

17:40.446 --> 17:41.447
a day

17:41.802 --> 17:43.607
for a million days.

17:45.055 --> 17:46.056
That's...

17:46.827 --> 17:48.513
That's 2700 years.

17:49.900 --> 17:50.767
Deal!

17:54.108 --> 17:55.110
Sucker.

17:55.863 --> 17:59.191
I'm sorry, is there a land bass
I don't know about?

18:03.256 --> 18:04.284
Let's get started.

18:04.409 --> 18:07.008
<i>And so, if I hadn't bought
those charts back for Marshall,</i>

18:07.177 --> 18:08.787
<i>I wouldn't have had to cut down 77th</i>

18:08.913 --> 18:10.417
<i>to give Milt his daily dollar</i>

18:10.542 --> 18:12.527
<i>and well, you know the rest.</i>

18:13.354 --> 18:15.630
<i>So, there you have it, kids.
There's a lot of little reasons</i>

18:15.755 --> 18:17.799
<i>why the big things
in our lives happen.</i>

18:17.924 --> 18:20.556
<i>If I had known then where
all those little things were leading me,</i>

18:20.681 --> 18:22.810
<i>and how grateful
I'd be to get there,</i>

18:22.935 --> 18:25.552
<i>well, I probably
would've done something</i>

18:26.189 --> 18:27.189
<i>like this.</i>

19:06.734 --> 19:10.171
<i>Because somehow, I ended up
in the right place at the right time.</i>

19:10.674 --> 19:12.025
<i>And, as a result,</i>

19:12.720 --> 19:14.430
<i>my life would never be the same.</i>

19:29.969 --> 19:32.867
<i>The next day, Uncle Barney
finally confronted Matthew Panning,</i>

19:32.992 --> 19:34.986
<i>the stud of Port Richmond
Middle School.</i>

19:35.111 --> 19:37.912
So, Barney, great to hear
from you after all this time.

19:38.038 --> 19:41.149
- What's been going on?
- I've had sex with 200 women.

19:43.839 --> 19:44.808
God!

19:44.934 --> 19:46.246
That's way too many.

19:46.371 --> 19:48.162
I mean, that's just gross.

19:48.554 --> 19:50.408
Have you sought counseling
for sex addiction?

19:50.533 --> 19:52.128
Because you're a prime candidate.

19:52.318 --> 19:54.590
Have you sought counseling
for I win you lose?

19:55.386 --> 19:57.053
Yeah, suddenly those 100 girls

19:57.178 --> 20:00.018
you nailed in the seventh grade
aren't so impressive.

20:00.326 --> 20:01.327
100 girls?

20:01.765 --> 20:04.194
Is that what this is about?
Barney, I lied.

20:04.768 --> 20:05.896
Sure you did.

20:06.240 --> 20:08.265
I was 12... of course I was lying.

20:08.768 --> 20:10.497
I didn't have a pet Ewok either.

20:10.838 --> 20:11.875
Sure you didn't.

20:12.779 --> 20:15.505
Your whole adult life
has been built around...

20:15.630 --> 20:18.263
something I lied about
when I was 12?

20:19.098 --> 20:19.974
Jealous?

20:20.504 --> 20:22.938
Look, I gotta go pick
my kids up at school.

20:23.352 --> 20:25.688
It sounds like you got
a lot of problems.

20:25.988 --> 20:27.484
Good luck, I guess.

20:29.627 --> 20:30.913
I'm awesome.

20:33.958 --> 20:35.059
Okay 200.

20:36.810 --> 20:37.821
Now what?
