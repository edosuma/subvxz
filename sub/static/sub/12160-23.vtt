00:03.089 --> 00:05.057
Hey, Mandy!
Guess whose eighth grade class

00:05.091 --> 00:08.494
is going to your high school
next week to get <i>oriented?</i>

00:08.528 --> 00:09.961
What!

00:09.980 --> 00:12.564
♪ Yeah, uh-huh ♪

00:12.599 --> 00:14.233
♪ yeah ♪

00:14.267 --> 00:16.285
No.

00:16.318 --> 00:18.570
- No. Stop. No. Stop. N-no.
- Mm-hmm.

00:18.605 --> 00:20.823
- ♪ Yep, yep, yep ♪
- Stop it.

00:20.857 --> 00:23.359
What's the problem?

00:23.410 --> 00:25.611
What if she talks to me?
What if she embarrasses me?

00:25.645 --> 00:28.530
Yeah, what if she doesn't
stop doing that?

00:30.083 --> 00:33.002
Please. I had to deal with
you being a dork around me.

00:33.036 --> 00:34.870
Do you remember when you
skated up to my locker

00:34.921 --> 00:36.505
wearing those stupid heelys?

00:37.841 --> 00:40.542
Yeah, I mean--
But look at me now, right?

00:40.593 --> 00:42.845
Wow.

00:42.879 --> 00:46.015
Ohh. I refuse to believe
you're going to high school,

00:46.099 --> 00:47.683
because you will always be

00:47.717 --> 00:50.552
my baby-waybee-
cutie-beauty-feauty!

00:50.603 --> 00:51.720
Mmm...

00:51.771 --> 00:53.222
Mom, those aren't words.

00:53.273 --> 00:55.841
Oh.

00:55.859 --> 00:58.227
Anyway, girls,
prepare to be impressed,

00:58.278 --> 01:01.313
because your mother--
<i>moi--</i>

01:01.347 --> 01:03.532
has been nominated for an award

01:03.566 --> 01:06.402
honoring the volunteer
parent of the year

01:06.453 --> 01:08.570
at Eve's school.

01:08.605 --> 01:10.188
No, no, wait, wait, wait, wait!

01:10.206 --> 01:12.157
Hold your applause, because
I just got off the phone

01:12.191 --> 01:14.526
with the principal, who told me
to prepare a few words,

01:14.544 --> 01:18.297
which means... there's
a good chance I'm gonna win.

01:18.364 --> 01:19.865
- That's great, mom.
- Yeah, mom.

01:19.899 --> 01:21.467
Yeah, we're really
excited for you.

01:21.501 --> 01:22.868
Yeah, thanks,
but I have to say,

01:22.886 --> 01:25.704
the best part is being able
to sit here with you girls

01:25.722 --> 01:26.889
and enjoy my moment...

01:26.923 --> 01:30.392
Peyton Manning showed up
at the store today!

01:30.427 --> 01:31.810
In the sun.

01:31.845 --> 01:32.961
- Listen!
- What?!

01:32.996 --> 01:34.430
He came down,

01:34.481 --> 01:36.214
he looked right at me
and said, "You're Outdoor Man!"

01:36.232 --> 01:37.633
- What?!
- Oh, my gosh!

01:37.667 --> 01:39.752
- Look at this. I got pictures.
- No way!

01:39.786 --> 01:42.604
He's carrying Ed like a football!

01:42.655 --> 01:46.742
Ed's smiling,
but he wasn't happy.

01:46.776 --> 01:50.746

01:50.780 --> 01:52.331
- Mike?
- Here.

01:52.365 --> 01:54.583
Oh, man, you are not
gonna believe this.

01:54.617 --> 01:56.568
- You know Gina Armstrong?
- Uh-huh.

01:56.586 --> 01:58.570
No, you don't.

01:58.638 --> 02:01.340
Then why did you ask me?

02:01.374 --> 02:04.460
Anyway, she got
her husband's landscaping firm

02:04.511 --> 02:07.596
to donate sod
for the new baseball field.

02:07.630 --> 02:09.298
That's good news.
Right field's like a swamp.

02:09.348 --> 02:11.049
We lost a couple kids there
last year

02:11.083 --> 02:13.185
'cause they didn't have
snorkels.

02:13.219 --> 02:15.554
Honey, it's-- it's like
she's trying to buy

02:15.588 --> 02:17.639
the volunteer parent award.

02:17.690 --> 02:19.808
Calm down. You're a shoo-in
for this award.

02:19.859 --> 02:21.860
Maybe they're just trying
to level the playing field

02:21.895 --> 02:24.196
by literally <i>leveling</i>
the playing field.

02:25.865 --> 02:27.983
You know, if she swoops in
and wins this thing

02:28.034 --> 02:30.702
after all my hard work--
the-- the carnivals,

02:30.737 --> 02:33.822
the bake sales,
the spaghetti dinners.

02:33.873 --> 02:35.440
Oh, you know what?

02:35.458 --> 02:37.993
I-I spent my birthday
in a dunk tank.

02:38.044 --> 02:41.580
It was 43 degrees,
and it smelled like urine.

02:43.333 --> 02:45.784
I thought you didn't care
about these awards.

02:45.802 --> 02:47.669
I don't. 15 years
of volunteering,

02:47.720 --> 02:49.721
and I never cared
about the recognition...

02:49.756 --> 02:52.508
And I just
want the world to know that!

02:56.429 --> 02:58.397
- Hey, boss, you rang?
- Yeah, come in, Mike.

02:58.431 --> 03:00.182
Have you looked at this market research?

03:00.233 --> 03:02.968
I did that market research.

03:02.986 --> 03:04.636
Well, then I don't need
to tell you

03:04.654 --> 03:06.655
that we have to increase
our-- our brand awareness

03:06.689 --> 03:08.023
among young males

03:08.074 --> 03:10.075
and reach the outdoor men
of tomorrow, right?

03:10.109 --> 03:12.310
Right. Unfortunately,
the Outdoor Man of tomorrow

03:12.328 --> 03:15.981
<i>tends to be</i>
the shoplifters of today.

03:15.999 --> 03:19.001
I've been kicking around
an idea. All right?

03:19.035 --> 03:21.336
- What do you think of this?
- All righty.

03:21.371 --> 03:23.288
Yeah, what if we released

03:23.322 --> 03:27.259
an Outdoor Man action figure
inspired by you?

03:27.293 --> 03:28.844
Look at that.

03:28.878 --> 03:31.513
Wow, like a superhero?
Huh?

03:31.548 --> 03:33.215
Who said anything
about a s--

03:33.266 --> 03:35.350
Y-you think you're
a superhero?

03:35.385 --> 03:37.302
You brought it up, Ed.

03:37.336 --> 03:39.688
I have a lead
with a Chinese toy company.

03:39.722 --> 03:41.240
- We'll get 'em cheap.
- I don't know.

03:41.274 --> 03:42.891
I don't want that kind
of recognition

03:42.942 --> 03:45.010
from the <i>communists.</i>

03:45.028 --> 03:47.062
You-- you just want
super powers?

03:47.113 --> 03:48.864
You brought it up!
- Okay.

03:48.898 --> 03:50.365
Who wants super powers?

03:50.400 --> 03:51.783
Mike does.

03:51.818 --> 03:53.702
If I could have one power,
it would be flight.

03:53.736 --> 03:55.120
How about you,
Mr. Alzate?

03:55.154 --> 03:59.691
The ability to digest
any food easily.

04:03.379 --> 04:05.747
If you could have one power,
that would be it?

04:05.798 --> 04:07.916
You have no idea
the kind of night that--

04:07.967 --> 04:10.002
That I had last night.

04:11.537 --> 04:14.022
- I think my power's way better than yours.
- Yeah.

04:14.057 --> 04:15.557
What, are you keeping score?

04:15.592 --> 04:17.226
Wait a second.

04:17.260 --> 04:19.094
Keeping score-- I think
I got an idea

04:19.144 --> 04:21.980
how we could bring in
the younger demographic.

04:22.015 --> 04:24.049
Can I change
my power to invisibility?

04:24.067 --> 04:26.585
I wish you would.

04:28.054 --> 04:29.438
Hey, honey.

04:31.441 --> 04:33.775
So how was orientation?

04:33.826 --> 04:35.577
Crazy. How did you make it
through high school?

04:35.612 --> 04:38.030
I had a baby
and finished online.

04:39.816 --> 04:42.334
Oh, right.

04:42.368 --> 04:44.836
Mom...

04:44.871 --> 04:46.455
High school is so different.

04:46.506 --> 04:48.540
Kids making out in the halls,
tattoos,

04:48.574 --> 04:50.125
and if there were any girls
without big boobs,

04:50.176 --> 04:52.077
they were hiding.

04:53.245 --> 04:55.881
Honey, I know it can be
overwhelming,

04:55.915 --> 04:57.866
but it doesn't start
until next fall.

04:57.900 --> 04:59.635
I promise you'll fit in.
You just--

04:59.686 --> 05:01.637
You just have to find
your... thing.

05:01.671 --> 05:02.921
What was your thing?

05:02.939 --> 05:04.473
Rainbow suspenders

05:04.524 --> 05:06.775
and a tube top.

05:11.698 --> 05:14.549
You know, it doesn't
sound hot, but it was.

05:16.903 --> 05:18.987
Do we have company,
or is it tiny dinner night?

05:19.038 --> 05:20.656
Oh...

05:20.707 --> 05:22.824
No, some parent volunteers
and I are arranging

05:22.875 --> 05:26.628
the displays for the auction
before the awards ceremony.

05:26.663 --> 05:27.946
The award you're gonna win?

05:27.964 --> 05:30.716
Shh! It's not official yet!

05:30.750 --> 05:32.501
- Hey, everybody!
- Hi!

05:32.552 --> 05:35.087
I have some rewards
for all your hard labor.

05:35.121 --> 05:37.506
- Oh, thank you.
- There you go.

05:37.557 --> 05:39.341
- Except for you, Mel.
- You were ten minutes late.

05:39.392 --> 05:41.226
I was!

05:41.260 --> 05:43.145
Vanessa, you're funny
because your jokes

05:43.179 --> 05:45.314
are based on true events.

05:45.348 --> 05:47.766
- Please, sit down. Take a break.
- Ohh...

05:47.800 --> 05:50.301
I mean, come on. You've
basically won the award already.

05:50.320 --> 05:52.804
Oh, please. No, there are a lot
of other candidates,

05:52.822 --> 05:54.823
and, uh, Gina Armstrong's
husband did donate sod

05:54.857 --> 05:56.408
for the new baseball field.

05:56.442 --> 05:58.327
She's right. Everybody's
talking about the sod.

05:58.361 --> 06:01.312
But Vanessa's been
an unsung hero for years.

06:01.331 --> 06:03.982
She painted the band room
with a 104-degree fever.

06:04.000 --> 06:07.119
Oh... Liz, we all
worked really hard that day.

06:07.153 --> 06:10.155
But my doctor did say I
could have died.

06:10.173 --> 06:11.990
Right. Right.

06:12.008 --> 06:15.377
<i>And</i> your husband donating
the scoreboard today.

06:15.428 --> 06:18.597
Exactly. Wait-- what?!
What scoreboard?

06:18.631 --> 06:20.582
For the baseball field.

06:20.616 --> 06:21.933
You didn't know?

06:21.968 --> 06:24.169
Oh, score-- scoreboard.

06:24.187 --> 06:26.221
Uh, yeah. Of course.
No. Yes.

06:26.272 --> 06:28.807
Everyone's talking
about the scoreboard.

06:30.026 --> 06:32.144
I thought they were
talking about the sod.

06:32.178 --> 06:34.012
The sod and the scoreboard.

06:37.567 --> 06:39.368
I don't know
what you're mad about.

06:39.402 --> 06:41.903
Gina's husband
leveled the playing field.

06:41.954 --> 06:43.855
I just tilted it back
in our direction.

06:43.873 --> 06:45.857
But, Mike, it looks like you're
trying to buy me the award.

06:45.875 --> 06:47.793
It doesn't mean as much
if you buy it.

06:47.827 --> 06:50.195
It doesn't mean anything
if you don't win it.

06:50.213 --> 06:52.247
So, what, so you think
I'm not gonna win it?

06:52.298 --> 06:53.865
I thought <i>you</i> didn't think
you were gonna win it.

06:53.883 --> 06:56.367
Why did you give me
that big <i>sod</i> story?

06:56.386 --> 06:59.304
Look, it was a good promotional
idea for Outdoor Man.

06:59.338 --> 07:00.806
It's a gift from you and I.

07:00.840 --> 07:03.175
Really? Well, wh-what does
the scoreboard say?

07:03.209 --> 07:04.476
Well, the score.

07:04.510 --> 07:05.844
And what else?

07:05.878 --> 07:07.846
We sponsored it,
so it says "Outdoor Man."

07:07.880 --> 07:09.598
Yeah, and-- and who is
Outdoor Man?

07:09.682 --> 07:12.734
In a way, aren't we all?

07:15.188 --> 07:17.489
You deal with him.

07:17.523 --> 07:20.826
She's mad about
the scoreboard thing, huh?

07:20.860 --> 07:23.361
I wasn't eavesdropping.
I was secretly listening.

07:23.395 --> 07:24.863
Usually when I annoy her,

07:24.897 --> 07:26.998
I know that I've done it
and I do it anyway.

07:27.066 --> 07:28.950
But this one
I didn't even see coming.

07:29.001 --> 07:31.286
Dad, you and I are a lot alike.

07:31.337 --> 07:33.138
No, we're not.

07:33.172 --> 07:35.907
We're both blessed with
a natural charisma, you know?

07:35.942 --> 07:39.094
You're Outdoor Man.
I'm Mandy Baxter.

07:39.128 --> 07:42.681
Sometimes that makes it
hard on those around us.

07:42.715 --> 07:45.650
What are you talking about?

07:46.652 --> 07:48.470
You tend to steal
the spotlight.

07:48.521 --> 07:49.771
You know, like, do you remember

07:49.806 --> 07:51.857
when mom got that big raise,
and then the same day

07:51.891 --> 07:54.476
you landed the cover
of "Colorado Wildlife"?

07:54.527 --> 07:56.478
I didn't plan that.
Sure. Okay.

07:56.529 --> 07:58.613
Or when she ran
the half-marathon.

07:58.648 --> 08:00.699
Oh, and the guy drops
from heat exhaustion?

08:00.733 --> 08:02.284
- I gave him CPR.
- Mm-hmm.

08:02.368 --> 08:03.819
But when she crossed
the finish line,

08:03.870 --> 08:05.603
everybody was back there
staring at you.

08:05.621 --> 08:07.372
And same thing
with the other day.

08:07.406 --> 08:08.790
Mom learned about
her boring award,

08:08.825 --> 08:11.126
and you met Peyton Manning.

08:11.160 --> 08:13.328
You steal the spotlight.
That's why she's mad.

08:13.379 --> 08:16.965
I don't steal the spotlight.
It just... finds me.

08:18.918 --> 08:20.669
But sometimes

08:20.720 --> 08:24.139
you know, you and I-- We've got to
dial down our natural charm

08:24.173 --> 08:28.727
so we fit in with
the rest of... the others.

08:28.761 --> 08:30.979
You know, I'm
sure buried underneath...

08:31.013 --> 08:34.466
All that is some
good advice, but...

08:34.500 --> 08:36.801
Remember, dad,
sometimes even the sun

08:36.818 --> 08:39.054
has to duck behind a cloud.

08:41.941 --> 08:43.491
Why are you crying?

08:43.525 --> 08:47.012
It's just sometimes I say
the most beautiful things.

08:55.390 --> 08:57.975
- Hey, kid.
- Oh, Mr. Alzate?

08:58.009 --> 08:59.643
- Yeah?
- Can I talk to you for a second?

08:59.677 --> 09:02.846
Kyle, you don't need to ask
permission to talk to me.

09:02.864 --> 09:05.315
But since you asked,
permission denied.

09:05.349 --> 09:06.984
- Uh, wait a second.
- Huh?

09:07.018 --> 09:08.569
I thought
you might like to know

09:08.620 --> 09:10.654
that a shipment arrived
this morning from Shanghai.

09:10.688 --> 09:13.073
- The action figures!
- I put them in your office.

09:13.124 --> 09:15.542
Right on schedule.
All right!

09:15.577 --> 09:17.377
So Mr. B finally
gave you the go-ahead?

09:17.412 --> 09:19.379
Uh, not exactly.
I'd already ordered them,

09:19.414 --> 09:21.164
but I'm sure
he's gonna love 'em.

09:21.215 --> 09:23.216
Uh...

09:26.137 --> 09:29.640
Uh, s-something's not right.

09:29.674 --> 09:31.541
I expected more action
in these figures,

09:31.559 --> 09:34.478
and less... bobble.

09:34.512 --> 09:37.514
Well, I specifically said
<i>"Jiaosewawa,"</i>

09:37.548 --> 09:39.399
not <i>"Yaotouwawa."</i>

09:40.551 --> 09:42.185
- It gets worse.
- Yeah?

09:42.219 --> 09:43.904
Turn it around.

09:47.158 --> 09:49.076
"Backdoor Man."

09:54.482 --> 09:56.533
That could be either
good or bad.

09:56.567 --> 09:57.901
You know...

09:57.919 --> 10:01.204
I'm quite sure
he'll think it's bad.

10:01.238 --> 10:02.706
Right, Mr. B?

10:04.342 --> 10:06.426
Don't let him see this.
All right?

10:06.461 --> 10:08.462
Thank God I only ordered five.

10:08.513 --> 10:10.931
You ordered 5,000.

10:10.965 --> 10:14.434
Okay, well, I have to brush up
on my mandarin, I guess.

10:21.142 --> 10:23.010
- Dad, you look really nice.
- Thank you.

10:23.044 --> 10:25.362
Although that tie
is a little subdued for you.

10:25.396 --> 10:28.565
Yeah. Honey, why didn't you wear
the tie I put out for you?

10:28.599 --> 10:29.933
Honey, this is <i>your</i> night.
I want <i>you</i> to shine.

10:29.951 --> 10:33.870
I'll change, but it just
makes my eyes sparkle.

10:33.905 --> 10:35.489
No, no.

10:35.540 --> 10:39.126
Dad, no. That tie's perfect.
It does nothing for you.

10:39.160 --> 10:41.912
Mandy, honey,
thanks for offering

10:41.946 --> 10:44.297
to drive Eve to the high school
orientation mixer.

10:44.332 --> 10:48.418
Oh, yeah, sure. No problem.
And, uh, I did her makeup, too.

10:48.452 --> 10:51.388
Ta-da!

10:53.091 --> 10:56.560
Hey, guys. What do--
What do you think?

10:56.594 --> 10:59.646
I'm... kinda conflicted.

11:03.401 --> 11:05.519
You look beautiful...

11:05.570 --> 11:07.637
and you're grounded.

11:11.526 --> 11:14.327
Is my little girl
somewhere under there?

11:14.362 --> 11:15.996
Come on. Be supportive.

11:16.030 --> 11:18.865
This is a big step for
our little Peppermint Patty.

11:20.818 --> 11:23.170
Mom, can I talk to you
real fast?

11:23.204 --> 11:24.838
Yeah. Yeah.

11:28.760 --> 11:31.595
What, uh...
What is it, honey?

11:31.629 --> 11:33.430
- Do I have to go?
- Oh...

11:33.464 --> 11:35.331
I don't fit in.
I don't have big boobs.

11:35.349 --> 11:37.050
I don't have a nose ring.

11:37.085 --> 11:39.352
I don't have a whale tail.

11:41.272 --> 11:43.673
What's a--
What's a whale tail?

11:43.691 --> 11:45.008
You know,
when your jeans ride down,

11:45.026 --> 11:47.227
- and your thong rides up.
- Okay-- All right, all right.

11:48.613 --> 11:52.015
You will never have
one of those.

11:52.033 --> 11:53.734
Honey, listen, just...

11:53.785 --> 11:55.535
High school is a little scary.

11:55.570 --> 11:57.821
Most new things are.

11:57.855 --> 11:59.322
But I like where I am.

11:59.356 --> 12:00.741
I just got junior high
all figured out.

12:00.792 --> 12:02.292
I know, but then that just
means you're ready

12:02.326 --> 12:03.960
to take the next step.

12:03.995 --> 12:05.662
Sweetie, sweetie, listen to me.

12:05.696 --> 12:08.198
There comes a point where
you need to say good-bye

12:08.216 --> 12:10.033
to one part of your life

12:10.051 --> 12:12.169
and say hello to something new.

12:12.203 --> 12:15.388
Like "R"-rated movies?

12:15.423 --> 12:17.707
Absolutely not.

12:20.762 --> 12:24.047
Those are just full of
curse words and violence.

12:24.065 --> 12:25.899
I just helped dad
change a tire last week.

12:25.933 --> 12:29.536
I'm pretty familiar
with curse words and violence.

12:32.573 --> 12:34.057
Oh.

12:34.075 --> 12:39.162
Wow, they did a pretty nice job
sprucing up this dump.

12:40.731 --> 12:44.734
What do you mean, "they"?
I was here at 6:00 AM.

12:44.752 --> 12:46.169
What is this?

12:46.204 --> 12:48.338
I give a Peyton Manning
signed NFL football,

12:48.372 --> 12:50.257
and the best this couple
could come up with

12:50.291 --> 12:55.578
was a-a semi-used DVD collection
of "Designing Women"?

12:55.596 --> 12:57.914
This is an auction.
It's not a landfill.

12:57.932 --> 13:00.684
All right, stop it.
I'm gonna start the bidding.

13:00.718 --> 13:02.602
Might as well just
put it in your purse.

13:02.637 --> 13:04.888
No one's gonna bid on this...

13:04.922 --> 13:06.056
Unless it's me.

13:06.090 --> 13:07.607
Well, what are you doing?
I just bid--

13:07.642 --> 13:09.425
Just outbid you
so it'll stay here.

13:12.396 --> 13:15.448
Here's some ni--
Oh, look at this!

13:15.483 --> 13:18.101
It's a whole collection.
"Scarface."

13:18.119 --> 13:20.153
Fake money,
a little machine gun, cigars--

13:20.204 --> 13:22.205
- <i>This</i> is worth something.
- All right, you know what?

13:22.240 --> 13:26.376
The only thing I like about
this basket <i>is</i> the basket.

13:26.410 --> 13:28.879
There's the principal.
I'm gonna go kiss his ring.

13:28.913 --> 13:30.780
There you go.

13:30.798 --> 13:35.335
Yeah.

13:36.420 --> 13:38.505
This is just--

13:40.000 --> 13:46.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

14:10.504 --> 14:11.538
Say hello

14:11.589 --> 14:13.540
to my little friend!

14:22.216 --> 14:24.684
All right, honey,
I think everything's set.

14:24.719 --> 14:26.052
Gosh, great turnout.

14:26.103 --> 14:28.688
- Vanessa!
- Mm. Yeah? Excuse me.

14:28.723 --> 14:31.274
- There's a problem with the salmon
hors d'oeuvres. - Oh. What is it?

14:31.309 --> 14:33.109
Everyone's eating them...
And then throwing up.

14:33.144 --> 14:35.345
Including Phil.

14:35.396 --> 14:37.564
Oh, no! No! Phil's our emcee.

14:37.615 --> 14:40.533
Well, not unless we're moving
this party to the bathroom.

14:40.568 --> 14:43.320
Stan, put the salmon down!

14:43.354 --> 14:44.454
Oh, no, honey.

14:44.488 --> 14:46.406
Looks like I'm gonna
have to emcee.

14:46.457 --> 14:47.908
You can't emcee this function.

14:47.959 --> 14:49.242
Why? Why not? I'm funny.

14:49.327 --> 14:52.362
- Yeah, you're hilarious, but, uh...
- Yeah.

14:52.380 --> 14:54.080
- Let's just say you win the award.
- Mm-hmm.

14:54.131 --> 14:55.198
You gonna give it to yourself?

14:55.216 --> 14:57.217
Oh. You're right.

14:57.251 --> 14:59.369
- You should do it.
- No.

14:59.387 --> 15:01.037
No, no, no, no, no.
It'll be just as bad.

15:01.055 --> 15:02.705
I open the envelope,
say your name,

15:02.723 --> 15:03.974
they're not gonna believe me.

15:04.008 --> 15:05.675
Honey, wait. First of all,
there's no envelope.

15:05.709 --> 15:07.727
It's not an awards show, okay?

15:07.762 --> 15:09.545
The-- the principal just whispers
in your ear. That's it.

15:09.563 --> 15:11.398
Honey, please.
Please, please, please.

15:11.432 --> 15:13.400
I just-- I need this
to be a success.

15:13.434 --> 15:15.018
All right. Let's be
very clear about this.

15:15.052 --> 15:17.720
You are <i>asking</i> me
to step into the spotlight

15:17.738 --> 15:20.607
- and do my best?
- Yes, that is-- That is the idea.

15:20.658 --> 15:21.741
- Yeah.
- Okay.

15:21.776 --> 15:23.076
Thank you, thank you,
thank you.

15:23.110 --> 15:25.028
- Good luck.
- All right. Good.

15:26.063 --> 15:28.064
Heh-heh-heh-heh-heh!

15:38.102 --> 15:39.185
So the bear comes over to me--

15:39.236 --> 15:40.637
We were camping, right?
And he says,

15:40.671 --> 15:42.372
"I heard what you said.
Of course we do it in the woods.

15:42.440 --> 15:45.442
We don't have outhouses!"

15:45.476 --> 15:47.544
Nah. No, I got a million
of these.

15:48.963 --> 15:51.781
Let's talk about our gym coach--
Steve Stifleman, huh?

15:51.815 --> 15:53.833
Great guy, great family man.

15:53.868 --> 15:55.585
What Steve doesn't know--

15:55.620 --> 15:57.987
If we don't get 30 grand
tonight,

15:58.005 --> 15:59.673
his position is gone.

15:59.707 --> 16:03.877
Going, going, gone--
There we go! Come on!

16:06.180 --> 16:09.516
Always the little lady
giving away the money, isn't it?

16:09.550 --> 16:12.852
Look at her. We got $1,500.
$1,500 for this lovely quilt.

16:12.887 --> 16:14.437
Do I have $1,600?
$1,600...

16:14.472 --> 16:15.722
You know, we're on pace to make

16:15.773 --> 16:17.107
twice as much money
as last year.

16:17.141 --> 16:19.025
Yeah, I know.
It's going great.

16:19.060 --> 16:21.194
I'm looking at you, Scott.

16:21.228 --> 16:23.697
Come on, Scott.
Eye contact.

16:23.731 --> 16:25.231
I don't think Jessica knows
how much money

16:25.282 --> 16:28.518
you've been making on those
Monday night poker games.

16:30.287 --> 16:33.957
Boy, kinda chilly
over here, isn't it?

16:33.991 --> 16:36.743
Hey, hey, come on.
2,500 bucks.

16:36.794 --> 16:38.528
It's for the quilt.
You're gonna need it,

16:38.546 --> 16:41.965
'cause you'll be sleeping
on the couch now, Scooter!

16:41.999 --> 16:44.300
Vanessa, congratulations.
I just heard!

16:44.335 --> 16:45.969
I know! We're really
raking this in.

16:46.003 --> 16:47.554
- Going once...
- No!

16:47.588 --> 16:49.872
I'm talking about getting
the volunteer parent award.

16:49.890 --> 16:52.642
- Going twice...
- Whoo!

16:52.677 --> 16:56.146
$2,500 to...
My wife over there.

17:02.353 --> 17:03.820
Hey!

17:03.854 --> 17:05.855
You won!

17:05.888 --> 17:07.607
Oh!

17:09.859 --> 17:12.228
And they gave you a quilt.

17:12.279 --> 17:14.230
Yeah. $2,500 later,

17:14.248 --> 17:18.284
a quilt with not a child
I recognize.

17:18.335 --> 17:20.920
It was very nice.
They gave me a standing ovation.

17:20.954 --> 17:22.338
- Really?
- Yeah.

17:22.373 --> 17:24.624
Oh, I actually thought I got
a standing ovation once at work,

17:24.675 --> 17:26.175
but it turned out
that it was a rat

17:26.210 --> 17:28.077
running across the restaurant!

17:29.680 --> 17:31.131
- Hey!
- Hey!

17:31.182 --> 17:33.416
Guess who was one of the last
people to leave the dance!

17:33.434 --> 17:35.018
Our little social butterfly.

17:35.052 --> 17:36.586
- That's great!
- ♪ Whoo, whoo ♪

17:36.604 --> 17:38.087
What's so great about it?

17:38.105 --> 17:41.424
This is not great.
Why did we beat them home?

17:41.442 --> 17:43.226
Well, mom, you were right.

17:43.260 --> 17:45.111
It was time for me to put away
part of my life

17:45.146 --> 17:47.614
and start something new.
Oh, my gosh, I'm so wired.

17:47.648 --> 17:49.365
I don't even know how
I'm gonna get to sleep.

17:49.400 --> 17:53.153
Hey, I got an idea.
Curl up with this quilt...

17:54.288 --> 17:56.456
- And "Scarface."
- Mike!

17:56.490 --> 17:59.442
An "R"-rated movie? Yes!
Thanks, dad!

17:59.460 --> 18:02.779
Turn the sound down
and shut your eyes!

18:02.797 --> 18:04.947
She'll be all right.
She's a big girl now.

18:04.965 --> 18:07.083
Yeah, she is.
She's a big girl.

18:08.252 --> 18:10.553
I guess I should take
some of my own advice.

18:10.588 --> 18:13.223
Yeah. Wow, that was
a great night, huh?

18:13.257 --> 18:14.808
Record amount raised.

18:14.842 --> 18:17.227
You got the volunteer award.

18:17.261 --> 18:18.978
You took it to Gina
and her husband

18:19.013 --> 18:21.297
with that long speech.
I loved that.

18:21.315 --> 18:22.849
It's funny
how you did that--

18:22.900 --> 18:25.318
What's the matter, honey?
I'm sorry.

18:25.352 --> 18:26.803
Look, you told me
to get on the stage

18:26.821 --> 18:28.271
and do that spotlight thing.

18:28.305 --> 18:29.906
I said-- The spotlight--
I just--

18:29.940 --> 18:31.691
- Oh, honey...
- I'm like a prisoner against the wall.

18:31.742 --> 18:34.244
The spotlight finds me.

18:34.278 --> 18:36.763
What the hell are you
talking about?

18:36.797 --> 18:39.415
Are you mad because I took--
I took the spotlight?

18:39.450 --> 18:41.984
No, no. It's just...

18:42.002 --> 18:45.338
Our last child
is going to high school.

18:48.158 --> 18:50.210
I'm just sad. I...

18:50.261 --> 18:52.796
- Yeah.
- Sad.

18:54.215 --> 18:55.849
Is there anything I can do?

18:55.883 --> 18:58.518
No.
No, nothing. Nothing.

18:58.552 --> 19:00.386
You can't stop the girls
from growing up.

19:00.437 --> 19:01.521
Yeah.

19:01.555 --> 19:02.856
You know, I just--

19:02.890 --> 19:05.024
I guess I need to
work through this myself.

19:05.059 --> 19:07.009
I need a little time.

19:07.027 --> 19:08.812
- Just be sad for a little while.
- I get it.

19:08.846 --> 19:10.647
- Yeah.
- Okay.

19:10.681 --> 19:12.198
Look. Where you going?

19:15.236 --> 19:18.037
You just said you wanted
to work this out.

19:18.072 --> 19:20.540
Not now!

19:22.126 --> 19:23.993
Oh, yeah.

19:27.381 --> 19:31.067
Ohh, boy.

19:35.589 --> 19:38.040
Yeah.

19:55.526 --> 19:57.994
Whoo!

20:02.616 --> 20:05.752
Oh...

20:13.125 --> 20:14.308
- All right.
- Mike, I don't know about this.

20:14.343 --> 20:15.593
- Come on. Come on.
- I feel ridiculous.

20:15.627 --> 20:16.894
It's your chance to be
in the spotlight.

20:16.929 --> 20:18.262
No, I'm not really
a spotlight person.

20:18.296 --> 20:19.664
- That's you. I don't--
- Okay, we'll just--

20:19.698 --> 20:20.815
We'll cancel everything.
We won't--

20:20.849 --> 20:21.966
No, no, no, no, no!
I'm gonna do it.

20:21.984 --> 20:22.917
Roll it. Roll it. Roll it.

20:22.951 --> 20:25.135
First off, you don't
"roll" this.

20:25.153 --> 20:27.021
And don't look there.
Look in the camera.

20:27.072 --> 20:28.639
- Talk to the camera.
- All right. All right, I got it.

20:28.657 --> 20:30.074
When you're ready to go,
just press the space bar.

20:30.108 --> 20:31.609
Okay. All right. Go.

20:33.445 --> 20:37.281
Hi. I'm Vanessa Baxter
for Outdoor Man.

20:37.315 --> 20:38.899
Men, take a five.

20:38.934 --> 20:41.669
Ladies, you know how
when your husband

20:41.703 --> 20:43.004
goes on those hunting trips,

20:43.038 --> 20:45.690
and they think they're
getting away with something?

20:45.724 --> 20:50.011
But the truth is,
we couldn't be happier.

20:50.045 --> 20:51.128
Really?

20:51.162 --> 20:54.515
Husbands are gone,
there's no snoring,

20:54.549 --> 20:57.001
no scratching, no gas.

20:57.019 --> 20:59.336
I mean, the whole place
smells 20% better.

20:59.354 --> 21:01.105
Right? See?

21:02.224 --> 21:03.724
So remember this--

21:03.775 --> 21:06.944
Every time you buy your man
a piece of camping equipment,

21:06.979 --> 21:10.765
you're really buying yourself
a day of peace and quiet.

21:10.799 --> 21:12.400
- Okay, I think you--
- Wait, I got more--

21:12.451 --> 21:13.985
- No, I think you've-- you've said enough.
- No, no. So, hey.

21:14.019 --> 21:15.620
Come on down to Outdoor Man

21:15.654 --> 21:19.123
and get your husbands
off your back...

21:19.157 --> 21:21.792
And off your front.

21:22.678 --> 21:24.495
Are you crazy?

21:24.529 --> 21:26.363
You know, our minister
watches this.

21:26.381 --> 21:28.082
Oh, please.
He's got eight kids.

21:28.133 --> 21:30.184
He knows
what I'm talking about.
