WEBVTT

00:55.800 --> 00:59.033
The owner of the voice meets Hyun-jun
and tells him about his parents.

00:59.667 --> 01:02.667
He convinces him to stop
the nuclear terrorist attack.

01:03.166 --> 01:06.133
Stopping the nuclear attack
and finding the one behind all of this

01:06.767 --> 01:09.033
is what you and I need to do, Hyun-jun.

01:10.300 --> 01:11.200
Sa-woo

01:11.533 --> 01:15.400
secretly disrupts the NSS's investigation
into the terrorists.

01:16.233 --> 01:17.200
But,

01:17.266 --> 01:21.200
Seung-hee, who located the terrorists
and raided their hideout alone,

01:21.600 --> 01:22.967
gets abducted by the terrorists.

01:25.900 --> 01:29.500
Hyun-jun, under Do-chul's orders,
interrogates Seung-hee.

01:29.567 --> 01:31.533
Remember that your choice
cannot be justified.

01:31.967 --> 01:33.233
Shut up and answer the question.

01:36.367 --> 01:37.266
San Baek and Sa-woo

01:37.633 --> 01:38.867
kill the owner of the voice,

01:40.367 --> 01:44.200
and the owner of the voice sends
live video feeds to Hyun-jun.

01:44.800 --> 01:46.467
"Whoever sheds human blood,

01:47.433 --> 01:49.367
by humans shall their blood be shed."

01:58.834 --> 02:00.433
EPISODE 14

02:15.367 --> 02:16.433
Don't think

02:17.333 --> 02:18.533
that this is the end.

02:20.533 --> 02:21.967
The person to finish the job

02:23.200 --> 02:24.367
wasn't going to be me anyway.

02:25.600 --> 02:28.133
Can you still say that
after what you've gone through?

02:29.166 --> 02:33.567
Whether it's a nation
or an individual like you,

02:34.533 --> 02:37.500
no force against Iris has survived.

02:39.066 --> 02:40.000
If...

02:41.100 --> 02:42.834
you've got Hyun-jun in mind,

02:44.533 --> 02:45.767
you should forget about him.

02:47.233 --> 02:48.166
We're only

02:49.000 --> 02:51.100
keeping him alive because we need him.

02:52.266 --> 02:55.133
If I want to, I'll end him any time.

02:58.633 --> 03:00.367
Is there anything else you'd like to say?

03:04.133 --> 03:05.867
"Whoever sheds human blood,

03:07.200 --> 03:09.233
by humans shall their blood be shed."

03:10.934 --> 03:13.600
It's from the Genesis,
chapter nine, verse six.

03:15.266 --> 03:17.667
I'll keep that in mind.

03:45.900 --> 03:46.867
No!

05:08.533 --> 05:09.567
I'll look around.

05:55.266 --> 05:56.734
I think they all got out. It's empty.

06:19.000 --> 06:20.734
Do you have anything else to say?

06:22.700 --> 06:24.400
"Whoever sheds human blood,

06:26.100 --> 06:28.166
by humans shall their blood be shed."

06:30.100 --> 06:32.533
t's from the Genesis,
chapter nine, verse six.

06:34.066 --> 06:36.734
I'll keep that in mind.

07:03.900 --> 07:04.800
GENESIS 9:16

07:07.500 --> 07:09.166
Whoever sheds human blood,

07:09.233 --> 07:10.967
by humans shall their blood be shed.

07:56.500 --> 08:00.967
Whether it's a nation
or an individual like you,

08:01.867 --> 08:04.967
no force against Iris has survived.

08:06.300 --> 08:08.900
If you've got Hyun-jun in mind...

08:09.000 --> 08:09.867
Father!

08:10.333 --> 08:12.300
If I want to, I'll end him any time.

08:30.200 --> 08:31.300
I'll drive.

08:31.533 --> 08:32.500
No, it's fine.

08:41.400 --> 08:43.734
The person next to San Baek
when he killed Professor Yoo...

08:44.767 --> 08:46.300
He's the person

08:47.367 --> 08:48.700
that was at the priest's grave

08:50.767 --> 08:51.800
with Seung-hee Choi, right?

08:54.200 --> 08:55.200
Who is he?

08:57.533 --> 08:58.567
Sa-woo Jin.

09:00.934 --> 09:01.967
He's my friend

09:03.367 --> 09:04.900
from before we became NSS agents.

09:05.934 --> 09:07.300
When I had no one,

09:09.233 --> 09:10.500
he was like a brother.

09:15.533 --> 09:16.400
Is he

09:17.533 --> 09:20.600
the person who aimed at you in Hungary?

09:30.900 --> 09:31.900
Since that day,

09:35.667 --> 09:37.200
I think about Sa-woo's eyes

09:39.467 --> 09:42.166
when he pointed the gun at me,
hundreds and thousands of times.

09:47.400 --> 09:48.600
He tried to kill me,

09:52.467 --> 09:54.033
but there's nothing he could have done.

09:56.400 --> 09:57.533
Both Sa-woo and I.

10:01.400 --> 10:02.533
We're destined to obey

10:03.367 --> 10:04.867
the organization's orders.

10:10.400 --> 10:12.033
Even if I got that order,

10:14.000 --> 10:15.300
it would have been the same.

10:18.767 --> 10:19.934
Perhaps Sa-woo, like me,

10:23.934 --> 10:25.800
was a sacrifice to San Baek's plot.

10:32.200 --> 10:33.533
I wanted to believe that.

10:38.900 --> 10:40.066
I never thought for a second

10:43.600 --> 10:44.700
that Sa-woo

10:48.000 --> 10:49.467
was a part of Iris.

11:01.800 --> 11:03.467
It's as if my biggest headache

11:03.800 --> 11:06.333
for the past decade is gone.

11:07.200 --> 11:09.367
Headquarters recognizes
your contributions,

11:10.000 --> 11:12.533
so you'll be rewarded appropriately.

11:16.066 --> 11:16.967
Should we

11:18.000 --> 11:19.700
take care of Hyun-jun, too?

11:20.834 --> 11:23.233
He may become a bigger liability.

11:24.133 --> 11:25.233
Leave it to me.

11:26.300 --> 11:27.633
I'll do it myself.

11:27.834 --> 11:29.066
Don't get ahead of yourself.

11:29.934 --> 11:31.867
You just need to do what I tell you to do.

11:34.100 --> 11:35.867
There's no more use for him,

11:36.633 --> 11:38.266
so they'll take care of it on their own.

11:38.734 --> 11:40.600
You don't need to worry about it.

12:17.433 --> 12:18.333
Honey!

12:19.867 --> 12:20.934
I'm late, right?

12:21.333 --> 12:22.900
I just got my hair done, how is it?

12:23.533 --> 12:24.433
Looks nice.

12:24.767 --> 12:25.800
What did you buy?

12:26.033 --> 12:26.934
Oh.

12:27.200 --> 12:28.800
The crab looked fresh, so I was thinking

12:29.066 --> 12:30.367
we'll have some seafood stew.

12:30.834 --> 12:31.767
Sounds great.

12:32.633 --> 12:33.934
It is really fresh.

12:35.300 --> 12:36.533
How much are the prawns?

12:37.066 --> 12:38.066
For 100 grams...

12:39.700 --> 12:40.533
Yes.

12:41.667 --> 12:42.600
It's completed.

12:43.734 --> 12:45.033
The center has gone down,

12:45.800 --> 12:47.600
so you won't need to worry about the rest.

12:50.066 --> 12:52.633
I'll take care of the other problem.

13:08.400 --> 13:09.300
Someone

13:09.800 --> 13:10.867
you know?

13:11.333 --> 13:12.200
Oh, no.

13:12.767 --> 13:14.867
Okay, let's go, then.

13:43.233 --> 13:44.500
YOU HAVE A MESSAGE

13:50.367 --> 13:51.367
Where are you going?

13:52.433 --> 13:53.300
Huh?

13:54.033 --> 13:56.600
I don't feel very well.
I'm just going to the medical office.

14:18.533 --> 14:21.200
I asked you not to come.

15:08.900 --> 15:10.100
What are you thinking about?

15:10.767 --> 15:11.767
Nothing.

15:12.667 --> 15:13.633
Coffee?

15:13.700 --> 15:14.767
Yes, thank you.

15:22.967 --> 15:23.800
What?

15:24.867 --> 15:26.734
I told you to leave Seoul quickly.

15:27.400 --> 15:28.300
You?

15:28.900 --> 15:31.000
I can't leave because of work.

15:34.467 --> 15:35.734
But you should leave soon.

15:38.133 --> 15:39.300
I won't go if you don't go.

16:02.133 --> 16:03.667
There was a shooting.

16:04.367 --> 16:06.967
The victim is an unidentified
sixty-year-old man,

16:07.100 --> 16:08.834
and 15 men who look like securities.

16:09.667 --> 16:10.967
Total of 16 people.

16:11.033 --> 16:12.333
All dead.

16:12.500 --> 16:13.934
We've controlled the media

16:14.433 --> 16:16.467
and took over the investigations.

16:17.033 --> 16:17.934
Why?

16:18.533 --> 16:20.834
Is there a relation
to the recent terrorist attempt?

16:22.100 --> 16:23.867
No signs of it yet,

16:24.233 --> 16:27.266
but it's a firearm related incident
at such a bad timing.

16:27.333 --> 16:29.734
Pass over the case to the Domestic Unit.

16:29.800 --> 16:30.667
Pardon me?

16:30.734 --> 16:33.433
The Counter-terrorism Division cannot
afford to investigate that as well.

16:33.667 --> 16:35.967
If the Domestic Unit can
find a relation to the terrorism,

16:36.834 --> 16:38.266
we can take it over then.

16:38.533 --> 16:41.533
The Counter-terrorism Division
will focus on locating the terrorists.

16:43.166 --> 16:44.200
Yes, sir.

16:53.500 --> 16:55.166
Hey, Secretary Park.

16:55.934 --> 16:56.767
Yes?

16:56.834 --> 16:59.200
About the recent shooting...

16:59.266 --> 17:00.700
I reviewed the bodies.

17:00.934 --> 17:03.767
You don't need to tell me.

17:04.100 --> 17:05.967
What? Why not?

17:07.567 --> 17:11.233
Director Baek ordered me
to pass this to the Domestic Unit.

17:11.800 --> 17:14.000
-Director Baek?
-Yes.

17:20.066 --> 17:21.300
Come here for a second.

17:30.000 --> 17:31.667
A little while ago, Sa-woo Jin

17:32.367 --> 17:34.133
came by to compare some body frames.

17:34.333 --> 17:35.266
Sa-woo Jin?

17:35.834 --> 17:38.100
I thought it was related
to the terrorist tracking

17:38.166 --> 17:39.734
and did it without thinking too much.

17:40.133 --> 17:41.033
And?

17:41.500 --> 17:44.567
I found a person who matches
with 92% likelihood

17:45.133 --> 17:47.734
to the person Sa-woo was looking for.

17:49.367 --> 17:50.300
Who is that?

17:50.800 --> 17:54.133
One of the bodies in our morgue.

17:58.900 --> 18:01.633
Are you trying to declare
a war against the South?

18:02.467 --> 18:03.533
The nuclear weapon

18:03.600 --> 18:04.700
must explode in Seoul.

18:06.233 --> 18:09.667
That way, our warriors
will be known for their heroic act.

18:10.533 --> 18:11.967
Many people...

18:12.367 --> 18:14.400
will suffer more than they do now.

18:14.767 --> 18:15.734
Of course,

18:16.700 --> 18:17.800
some

18:18.800 --> 18:20.133
will be sacrificed.

18:21.433 --> 18:22.433
Through this war,

18:22.500 --> 18:24.233
I'll build a much younger

18:26.700 --> 18:28.033
and stronger republic.

18:31.700 --> 18:33.100
Commissioner Yeon is looking for you.

18:42.200 --> 18:43.467
It's the last time

18:44.600 --> 18:45.967
to convince you.

18:47.133 --> 18:49.066
If you don't follow my orders,

18:49.934 --> 18:52.233
I will return you back to the North.

18:53.033 --> 18:55.533
You can probably imagine
what'll follow next.

18:57.066 --> 18:58.266
Don't you understand?

18:59.967 --> 19:00.934
This whole thing.

19:02.200 --> 19:04.633
It's outside of what you can do
through will power.

19:08.233 --> 19:09.266
You believe the Republic

19:09.834 --> 19:12.734
is going to get its strength back, right?

19:13.600 --> 19:14.734
Me, too.

19:15.800 --> 19:18.400
I've waited patiently for that day
more than anyone.

19:18.467 --> 19:21.333
Not just you and me,
thousands of people have.

19:22.567 --> 19:24.500
But what's the product of that patience?

19:25.400 --> 19:26.700
Just like you're suggesting,

19:27.266 --> 19:29.166
we're begging for a united nation.

19:32.000 --> 19:33.934
I did not betray the Republic.

19:34.100 --> 19:36.567
It's the President of the Supreme
People's Assembly Presidium.

19:36.633 --> 19:37.800
My decision

19:38.967 --> 19:40.233
isn't treason.

19:41.800 --> 19:43.433
It's a revolution.

19:47.333 --> 19:49.567
I believe that for the revolution
of the Republic,

19:50.800 --> 19:52.900
you are the man who can endure pain

19:53.266 --> 19:55.967
to get to the goal.

19:59.633 --> 20:00.834
Was I wrong?

20:07.734 --> 20:09.333
As you wish, sir.

20:13.834 --> 20:15.033
Thank you.

20:15.834 --> 20:17.633
When is the nuclear weapon set to go off?

20:18.667 --> 20:20.800
We can't stay in Seoul by then?

20:21.633 --> 20:22.734
In that moment,

20:23.934 --> 20:25.467
we will not be in Seoul.

20:25.934 --> 20:27.133
Don't worry.

20:36.900 --> 20:37.834
I'm afraid

20:37.900 --> 20:39.467
there's a mole in the organization.

20:40.367 --> 20:41.500
Do you have a suspect?

20:42.200 --> 20:43.233
Sa-woo Jin.

20:44.100 --> 20:45.166
Sa-woo Jin?

20:45.233 --> 20:46.166
Yes.

20:47.033 --> 20:48.066
How should we proceed?

20:48.500 --> 20:50.700
I'll order Internal Affairs
to look into it,

20:51.300 --> 20:52.533
so don't worry about it.

20:53.567 --> 20:54.500
You can leave now.

20:59.066 --> 21:00.066
What's going on?

21:00.233 --> 21:01.600
I wanted to ask you something.

21:03.767 --> 21:05.967
You run Internal Affairs, right?

21:06.266 --> 21:07.166
Yes.

21:07.233 --> 21:08.600
Did Director Baek ever

21:09.300 --> 21:10.467
ask you to look into

21:10.533 --> 21:13.200
Sa-woo Jin?

21:13.533 --> 21:15.734
No, I haven't heard anything yet.

21:15.800 --> 21:16.700
You're sure?

21:17.200 --> 21:19.467
Of course, if it came from Director Baek,

21:19.533 --> 21:21.400
it should have made its way up to me.

21:21.700 --> 21:23.000
I wouldn't have missed it.

21:38.533 --> 21:40.066
Is something wrong?

21:42.467 --> 21:44.834
Commissioner Gi-hoon Yeon
has other objectives.

21:45.233 --> 21:48.300
He plans on releasing
the nuclear weapon onto Seoul.

21:48.700 --> 21:49.600
Plus,

21:50.900 --> 21:53.433
he's planning on starting
a war between the North and South.

21:53.734 --> 21:55.900
Should we contact the headquarters

21:56.367 --> 21:58.400
to cancel the operation?

22:02.200 --> 22:04.233
Do-chul Kang betrayed me.

22:05.166 --> 22:07.800
He's following
Commissioner Gi-hoon Yeon's orders.

22:13.467 --> 22:15.333
Mr. Yeon is thinking of escaping Seoul

22:15.400 --> 22:17.500
before the nuclear weapon goes off.

22:18.400 --> 22:19.834
Gi-hoon Yeon's movement will mean

22:21.166 --> 22:23.166
that the weapon will go off soon.

22:25.367 --> 22:28.333
We'll have to monitor his movement
closely from now on.

22:29.300 --> 22:30.333
Yes, sir.

22:32.467 --> 22:35.066
What will you do about Do-chul Kang?

22:36.300 --> 22:37.967
I'll have to meet with Sun-hwa first.

22:39.300 --> 22:40.300
Contact her.

22:40.934 --> 22:41.967
Yes, sir.

22:49.467 --> 22:51.633
Did you find the cause
for the satellite connection failure?

22:52.200 --> 22:54.400
Yes, the IO station's gateway module

22:54.467 --> 22:55.667
were all burnt.

22:55.934 --> 22:58.467
That's impossible
with the three-step safety measure,

22:58.900 --> 22:59.900
so it's really strange.

23:01.533 --> 23:02.567
What's even stranger is that

23:02.800 --> 23:03.700
even if that happened,

23:03.767 --> 23:05.600
the satellite image data near the factory

23:05.734 --> 23:06.967
should remain in the server,

23:07.800 --> 23:08.867
but there's none.

23:10.867 --> 23:12.333
What about the nearby video surveillance?

23:12.433 --> 23:14.166
The warehouse is located near factories,

23:14.567 --> 23:16.333
so there are too many
similar type of vans,

23:17.467 --> 23:19.800
and the nearest camera is
seven kilometers outside the location.

23:20.633 --> 23:22.467
It'll be hard to find
through video surveillance.

23:59.200 --> 24:01.000
How's the summit camp?

24:02.467 --> 24:03.900
I don't plan on staying too long,

24:04.533 --> 24:05.900
so we only have the essentials.

24:07.333 --> 24:08.300
Where's your family?

24:09.200 --> 24:10.200
Oh, I've sent them

24:10.900 --> 24:12.834
on a trip somewhere for a while.

24:14.300 --> 24:15.633
When the nuclear weapon explodes,

24:16.467 --> 24:19.200
it'll be announced immediately that
the rebellious force within the Republic

24:19.266 --> 24:20.233
committed the act.

24:21.033 --> 24:23.433
Have you decided on the D-day?

24:25.400 --> 24:26.300
Yes.

24:30.000 --> 24:31.133
When is it?

24:39.667 --> 24:40.700
Before that,

24:41.200 --> 24:43.467
there's something
you need to take care of for me.

24:43.767 --> 24:44.700
Go ahead.

24:44.934 --> 24:47.133
Hyun-jun Kim is

24:48.734 --> 24:50.233
working on your spy team.

24:50.767 --> 24:51.633
I'm aware.

24:52.133 --> 24:54.867
Please take care of him before D-day.

25:11.767 --> 25:12.667
It's me.

25:14.033 --> 25:15.367
Hyun-jun Kim and Sun-hwa Kim,

25:16.667 --> 25:17.967
take care of them before D-day.

25:18.467 --> 25:19.467
Yes, sir.

25:23.533 --> 25:24.633
What is it?

25:27.066 --> 25:28.567
Hyun-jun Kim and Sun-hwa Kim.

25:30.333 --> 25:31.667
There's an order to take them out.

25:33.567 --> 25:34.700
When do we do it?

25:35.767 --> 25:36.900
I'll do it.

25:38.133 --> 25:39.200
Not yet.

25:40.800 --> 25:41.767
Gather everyone.

25:43.033 --> 25:44.066
Yes, sir.

25:58.066 --> 25:58.967
On D-day,

25:59.667 --> 26:02.066
make sure to know your routes and time

26:02.900 --> 26:04.667
so that we don't make any mistakes
on the job.

26:05.800 --> 26:06.800
Explosives?

26:07.333 --> 26:08.734
Almost complete.

26:09.033 --> 26:10.567
Make sure there are no defects.

26:10.834 --> 26:11.667
Yes, sir.

26:12.066 --> 26:14.900
Young-beom, double check the escape route,

26:15.567 --> 26:17.000
review the transport and report back.

26:17.633 --> 26:18.567
Yes, Captain.

26:19.367 --> 26:22.066
Kwang-su and Kang-seok,
prep for engagement.

26:22.700 --> 26:23.800
Double check the radio.

26:24.367 --> 26:25.333
Yes, sir.

26:36.000 --> 26:36.867
Move.

26:44.600 --> 26:45.633
What are you doing?

26:48.867 --> 26:50.033
You guys don't need to know.

26:51.433 --> 26:53.000
Captain has a different task for you.

26:53.567 --> 26:54.934
So just wait quietly.

27:02.667 --> 27:04.000
What do you think is going on?

27:07.367 --> 27:09.000
It means they'll release the bomb soon.

27:10.100 --> 27:11.000
What do we do?

27:11.800 --> 27:13.300
We don't know anything yet.

27:22.500 --> 27:24.166
The only thing we can rely on
is this for now.

27:51.166 --> 27:52.333
Sir, what's going on?

27:52.633 --> 27:53.834
Hurry up and open the door.

28:02.300 --> 28:03.700
Did you finish the summary report?

28:04.166 --> 28:05.266
Did you come by for that?

28:05.900 --> 28:06.767
No, well...

28:08.166 --> 28:09.367
I wanted to talk to you.

28:11.300 --> 28:12.367
Do you want some coffee?

28:12.600 --> 28:13.500
No, thank you.

28:14.400 --> 28:15.400
Sit.

28:23.500 --> 28:24.433
Did you

28:25.300 --> 28:26.600
see Hyun-jun

28:27.734 --> 28:29.000
when you were held captive?

28:32.100 --> 28:33.066
Yes.

28:33.433 --> 28:34.800
Did you hear anything

28:35.633 --> 28:37.166
why he became a terrorist?

28:38.400 --> 28:39.734
I didn't get a chance to.

28:41.300 --> 28:42.734
Why do you think they let you live?

28:43.467 --> 28:44.533
I'm not sure.

28:45.300 --> 28:47.467
They even injected truth serum into me

28:48.033 --> 28:50.033
to get the NSS security code.

28:50.533 --> 28:52.200
Why did they let me go all of a sudden?

28:58.333 --> 28:59.433
Since some time ago,

29:00.533 --> 29:02.166
all the things that are
happening around me

29:03.400 --> 29:06.033
aren't making any sense.

29:07.300 --> 29:08.667
I think there is a mole

29:10.100 --> 29:11.967
inside the NSS.

29:14.100 --> 29:15.433
And I think I found out who.

29:17.967 --> 29:19.033
Who is it?

29:19.867 --> 29:21.066
Sa-woo Jin

29:22.734 --> 29:23.934
and Director Baek.

29:42.266 --> 29:43.233
Welcome.

29:43.600 --> 29:44.600
How can I help you?

30:02.500 --> 30:03.667
Please show me the key.

30:19.133 --> 30:20.033
Come with me.

30:28.200 --> 30:29.433
It's 925.

31:26.633 --> 31:27.533
Take care.

31:37.367 --> 31:39.000
He just picked up the item.

35:27.066 --> 35:28.400
We'll have to inspect you.

35:40.300 --> 35:41.367
Come with us.

36:03.333 --> 36:04.233
Hello, sir.

36:05.533 --> 36:06.367
Come in.

38:38.166 --> 38:40.200
Do you remember who this is?

38:40.567 --> 38:44.200
Oh, he's the NSS agent who saved my life

38:44.266 --> 38:45.867
during the presidential campaign speech.

38:46.667 --> 38:47.567
Your name is...

38:48.133 --> 38:49.133
It's Hyun-jun Kim.

38:51.667 --> 38:53.800
The agent you visited the Blue House with,

38:54.166 --> 38:55.266
Sa-woo Jin, was it?

38:55.667 --> 38:58.000
I remember the name because it was unique.

38:59.900 --> 39:00.800
Yes, sir.

39:02.533 --> 39:05.100
Are you still a part of the NSS?

39:08.166 --> 39:10.567
No, sir. He has been charged
under espionage

39:11.433 --> 39:13.233
and has been recorded as deceased.

39:13.500 --> 39:14.900
What do you mean?

39:15.834 --> 39:18.000
How can a live person be
recorded as deceased?

39:19.200 --> 39:21.367
And espionage?

39:22.300 --> 39:23.233
I...

39:25.300 --> 39:27.333
I assassinated President Seong-cheol Yun.

39:30.667 --> 39:31.867
Whose orders

39:32.700 --> 39:33.867
did you act under?

39:34.767 --> 39:36.367
Director San Baek of the NSS.

39:40.700 --> 39:43.100
It's already been six hours
since we last tracked his location.

39:43.533 --> 39:44.567
What do you mean?

39:45.834 --> 39:46.900
What did Secret Service say?

39:47.333 --> 39:49.400
They're keeping it a secret.

39:50.500 --> 39:51.500
Who was with him?

39:52.066 --> 39:53.433
Secretary Hyung-jun Jung.

39:57.333 --> 39:58.200
Okay.

39:59.233 --> 40:00.233
Figure out where he is.

40:08.867 --> 40:09.767
It's me.

40:10.600 --> 40:11.467
The President

40:12.333 --> 40:14.800
has not been located for six hours.

40:17.934 --> 40:18.934
Yes.

40:21.333 --> 40:22.467
Yes, sir.

40:35.000 --> 40:36.934
There is a group called Iris.

40:38.734 --> 40:41.266
And there is a group against it.

40:42.900 --> 40:46.867
Iris influences both
the North and the South,

40:48.800 --> 40:52.433
and the NSS Director Baek,
is also taking their orders.

40:53.800 --> 40:54.734
Is that right?

40:55.900 --> 40:56.867
Yes, sir.

40:58.333 --> 41:01.333
I can't really believe it, but...

41:04.467 --> 41:06.433
Take a look at this.

41:14.233 --> 41:15.400
Who is this?

41:16.500 --> 41:17.600
In the past,

41:17.800 --> 41:20.500
he worked under President Chung-hee Park
for nuclear development.

41:21.000 --> 41:22.467
He's Professor Jeong-hoon Yoo.

41:23.200 --> 41:24.667
I met him

41:25.400 --> 41:27.667
when I worked
for Foreign Affairs in Paris.

41:28.233 --> 41:29.800
After the nuclear project was scrapped,

41:30.567 --> 41:32.333
Director Baek, under Iris's orders,

41:33.800 --> 41:35.800
killed my parents and other scientists,

41:36.800 --> 41:38.333
but Professor Yoo, who barely got away,

41:38.633 --> 41:39.767
escaped to a foreign country,

41:41.333 --> 41:44.300
built an anti-Iris organization,

41:44.367 --> 41:45.367
and stood against them.

41:47.200 --> 41:48.133
Is it true

41:48.800 --> 41:51.100
that you have the evidence and list

41:51.667 --> 41:54.100
to uncover San Baek and Iris?

41:54.700 --> 41:55.567
Yes.

41:55.767 --> 41:57.800
Well, then why don't we arrest San Baek

41:58.567 --> 42:00.100
and identify

42:00.734 --> 42:02.166
the active members?

42:02.500 --> 42:03.500
We can't do that.

42:04.633 --> 42:06.200
There are two reasons why.

42:06.834 --> 42:07.767
First.

42:08.667 --> 42:10.433
I don't have the complete list.

42:11.166 --> 42:13.533
There is someone above Director Baek,

42:13.600 --> 42:14.934
but I don't know who that is.

42:16.133 --> 42:17.333
If we don't pull out the root,

42:18.967 --> 42:21.734
it'll be difficult to uncover
the true nature of Iris.

42:22.433 --> 42:25.066
Then, what's the second reason?

42:25.900 --> 42:26.867
The nuclear terror attack.

42:28.166 --> 42:29.467
Is a nuclear attack

42:30.700 --> 42:32.066
Iris's plan?

42:32.467 --> 42:33.333
Yes.

42:36.266 --> 42:38.867
When we can't even believe
the NSS Director,

42:39.800 --> 42:42.000
how will we stop a nuclear attack?

42:43.000 --> 42:44.033
I am currently

42:44.100 --> 42:47.133
living with the terrorists
who have the nuclear weapon.

42:47.433 --> 42:49.367
They don't know my plan.

42:50.166 --> 42:52.066
They still think I'm on their side,

42:52.333 --> 42:54.000
so I can get close to the weapon.

42:54.633 --> 42:55.834
That nuclear weapon.

42:56.900 --> 42:57.934
Where is it?

42:58.400 --> 42:59.900
I'm not sure,

43:01.066 --> 43:03.333
but movements for the nuclear attack
have already begun.

43:04.600 --> 43:05.433
Soon,

43:06.000 --> 43:07.734
they'll release the bomb
in the middle of Seoul.

43:32.734 --> 43:34.900
GREAT GENERAL SUN-SIN YI

44:54.000 --> 44:57.567
SEJONG THE GREAT

44:58.367 --> 44:59.900
The Blue House's finest and brightest

45:00.767 --> 45:03.133
didn't even know the President's
whereabouts all day.

45:03.800 --> 45:05.500
How can this happen?

45:07.066 --> 45:09.934
Sir! Please say something.

45:10.900 --> 45:12.100
Where have you been?

45:13.734 --> 45:15.567
How many times has this been?

45:16.033 --> 45:17.800
He pushed for the summit abruptly,

45:18.700 --> 45:20.300
and we're dealing with nuclear terrorism.

45:20.500 --> 45:22.967
And now he's missing for hours.

45:24.934 --> 45:26.200
I almost think our President

45:27.433 --> 45:29.967
doesn't believe us anymore.

45:30.800 --> 45:31.767
We cannot

45:32.266 --> 45:34.033
run the country this way.

45:34.867 --> 45:37.767
This must be why situations like
the nuclear attack occur.

45:38.467 --> 45:40.066
I understand you're upset,

45:41.033 --> 45:43.100
but you need to watch your tone.

45:44.400 --> 45:45.367
To be honest,

45:46.000 --> 45:47.800
the recent decisions made by the President

45:48.567 --> 45:50.266
have troubled me, too.

45:50.333 --> 45:51.500
Not you, too!

45:55.700 --> 45:56.600
Everyone,

45:57.333 --> 45:58.867
I understand how you feel,

45:59.967 --> 46:01.867
but I cannot tell you now.

46:04.166 --> 46:06.200
You will find out when the time is right.

46:16.166 --> 46:18.367
Sorry, I'm a little late.

46:18.934 --> 46:21.734
Is there any progress
with locating the terrorists?

46:22.233 --> 46:23.600
We are still investigating.

46:23.667 --> 46:24.600
For how long?

46:25.266 --> 46:26.633
How long will you just investigate?

46:27.467 --> 46:28.533
Do you plan on finding them

46:29.133 --> 46:30.533
once the nuclear bomb detonates?

46:31.433 --> 46:34.000
We can no longer just rely on the NSS

46:34.433 --> 46:35.667
and leave this issue alone.

46:36.100 --> 46:38.000
The Head of National Security is right.

46:39.000 --> 46:41.400
We can no longer just wait.

46:42.066 --> 46:45.266
We need to declare state of emergency.

46:45.567 --> 46:46.467
Also,

46:47.166 --> 46:49.900
the President can no longer
stay here either.

46:50.400 --> 46:51.300
I think it's time

46:52.433 --> 46:53.734
we meet the President

46:54.433 --> 46:55.800
and tell him ourselves.

46:57.300 --> 46:59.533
Where is the President now?

47:00.066 --> 47:01.400
He's in his office,

47:02.000 --> 47:03.367
but asked not to let anyone in.

47:10.300 --> 47:11.166
Yes.

47:12.867 --> 47:14.166
He's here.

47:14.834 --> 47:15.934
Yes, sir.

47:17.333 --> 47:20.300
The President wants to see you.

47:27.367 --> 47:29.266
Do you know where he was?

47:30.133 --> 47:33.166
No, Secretary Jung is also keeping quiet.

47:34.100 --> 47:36.266
That means they're onto something.

47:37.133 --> 47:38.500
What did the superiors say?

47:38.967 --> 47:41.266
Everything will be as planned.

47:44.633 --> 47:46.266
I'm not sure if it was wise

47:47.400 --> 47:49.166
to tell the Blue House's Chief

47:50.133 --> 47:51.700
about the nuclear attack.

47:53.767 --> 47:55.600
"It's a summit with no benefits."

47:56.867 --> 47:59.934
"It'll harm the Korea-US alliance."

48:00.066 --> 48:01.433
There are lots of discussions.

48:03.033 --> 48:04.066
Director Baek.

48:04.433 --> 48:05.266
Yes.

48:05.800 --> 48:07.900
You've said that the NSS is an agency

48:08.700 --> 48:12.100
that protects the President's policies
without any political motive, right?

48:13.300 --> 48:14.300
Yes.

48:14.367 --> 48:15.967
I want your thoughts

48:17.800 --> 48:20.233
on the upcoming summit discussion.

48:22.233 --> 48:23.133
Pardon?

48:23.200 --> 48:24.700
Not as the NSS Director,

48:25.567 --> 48:29.033
but your personal opinion as San Baek.

48:33.200 --> 48:35.734
Without a doubt, the current attempt
for a nuclear attack is prepared

48:36.500 --> 48:40.033
by a group against the summit discussion.

48:40.867 --> 48:44.700
Your will to reunite the North and South
and the change in regime in North Korea...

48:45.367 --> 48:47.900
To those who don't want Korea to reunite,

48:48.667 --> 48:51.967
it's certain this is not a good scenario.

48:52.800 --> 48:54.033
Who are they?

48:54.600 --> 48:55.533
Pardon?

48:58.700 --> 49:01.133
The groups against
the summit discussion are--

49:01.200 --> 49:02.500
I said, who are they?

49:05.033 --> 49:05.967
Sorry.

49:06.767 --> 49:07.867
Perhaps...

49:08.734 --> 49:11.633
I misunderstood your question--

49:11.700 --> 49:12.900
Never mind.

49:13.266 --> 49:15.567
I will take any risks

49:16.567 --> 49:19.100
to make the summit discussion happen.

49:19.667 --> 49:22.066
Anything getting in the way of the summit

49:23.300 --> 49:25.400
will not be forgiven.

49:42.100 --> 49:45.800
-I was followed.
-Don't be suspicious and act normal.

49:57.700 --> 49:58.800
Like you said,

49:59.300 --> 50:01.166
if even Director Baek is a suspect,

50:01.367 --> 50:03.567
where do we start solving this puzzle?

50:03.900 --> 50:05.500
Hyun-jun saved you

50:06.033 --> 50:07.567
in the NSS secret archive, right?

50:07.667 --> 50:08.567
Yes.

50:08.633 --> 50:11.500
First, we need to figure out why

50:12.433 --> 50:13.633
Hyun-jun is with the terrorists.

50:13.967 --> 50:16.333
Then we'll know the true identity
of Director Baek and Sa-woo Jin

50:17.500 --> 50:20.500
and figure out who the spy is.

50:21.000 --> 50:23.800
How do we find Hyun-jun
if we're always being watched?

50:24.400 --> 50:26.934
Start over from the warehouse
in Seoksu, Anyang.

50:27.967 --> 50:29.233
I'll support you.

50:36.667 --> 50:37.533
Secretary Yang.

50:38.967 --> 50:40.533
I need some help.

50:42.367 --> 50:43.300
Come see me for a second.

51:15.934 --> 51:16.800
Is this the police?

51:40.767 --> 51:41.967
I need to run the license plate.

51:43.200 --> 51:46.834
It's 38D028...

51:46.900 --> 51:48.800
Excuse me,
can I please see your identification?

53:07.734 --> 53:08.767
We lost her.

53:09.600 --> 53:11.467
Find her and keep checking in.

53:11.533 --> 53:12.600
Yes, sir.

53:31.233 --> 53:32.767
It's me, how did it go?

53:32.834 --> 53:33.800
Yes, hold on.

53:33.867 --> 53:35.300
It's almost done.

53:35.900 --> 53:36.800
Here.

53:37.533 --> 53:38.834
There is only one route

53:38.900 --> 53:41.800
that drives over eight speed bumps
within 15 minutes from the warehouse.

53:41.867 --> 53:43.100
I'll transfer you the results now.

53:49.133 --> 53:50.066
It came through.

53:58.867 --> 54:00.734
The last three speed bumps were

54:00.800 --> 54:01.900
seven and five seconds apart.

54:06.667 --> 54:09.033
One, two, three,

54:09.533 --> 54:12.100
four, five, six,

54:13.266 --> 54:14.266
seven.

54:16.367 --> 54:17.867
-One, two,
-Next one is five seconds?

54:18.367 --> 54:20.166
three, four,

54:20.233 --> 54:21.266
five.

54:26.100 --> 54:27.100
We can only tell up to

54:27.166 --> 54:28.633
the split between

54:28.700 --> 54:30.800
the local road 332 and route 53.

54:34.500 --> 54:35.567
Stop the car here.

54:52.967 --> 54:55.533
We need the
video surveillance record of 1506-03.

54:56.734 --> 54:57.934
I know the time it took to pass,

54:58.000 --> 54:59.967
so we should be able
to identify the terrorists' car.

55:00.266 --> 55:02.767
It's the car that entered the highway
in three minutes from here.

55:02.934 --> 55:03.900
But

55:03.967 --> 55:04.967
even if you find the car,

55:05.533 --> 55:06.800
to find their route,

55:07.567 --> 55:09.333
we'll need a tracking system.

55:10.600 --> 55:11.633
Um,

55:12.400 --> 55:14.400
for now, contact the SWAT for help

55:15.500 --> 55:18.567
and expand the search radius
to the urban area.

55:21.967 --> 55:22.900
What's going on?

55:23.600 --> 55:26.800
Are you able to contact Ms. Choi?

55:27.600 --> 55:28.433
Why?

55:30.000 --> 55:31.266
Director Baek is looking for her.

55:32.266 --> 55:33.333
Isn't Seung-hee

55:34.000 --> 55:35.567
on standby at home?

55:36.100 --> 55:37.300
I never contacted her.

55:38.467 --> 55:39.367
You?

55:39.734 --> 55:40.800
Me, neither.

55:48.900 --> 55:50.400
The tracking system will

55:50.533 --> 55:52.033
require the situation room's server.

55:52.934 --> 55:54.166
That's outside of our authority.

55:55.066 --> 55:56.400
Maybe not Mr. Park.

56:00.233 --> 56:01.400
Go to the server room

56:01.734 --> 56:03.800
and activate the tracking system.

56:04.266 --> 56:05.900
I'm not allowed to go in there.

56:09.700 --> 56:10.667
Will it be okay?

56:11.166 --> 56:12.734
Don't worry,
I'll take full responsibility.

56:15.400 --> 56:16.367
Hurry up.

56:38.233 --> 56:39.367
We found the truck.

56:39.700 --> 56:41.100
Where was the last known location?

56:41.467 --> 56:43.300
Around Jongro.
I'll send you the results now.

56:50.700 --> 56:53.033
Okay, I'll call you when we arrive.

56:54.367 --> 56:55.433
Let's hurry.

57:14.233 --> 57:15.100
It's me.

57:15.533 --> 57:16.800
I found Ms. Choi.

57:17.934 --> 57:20.000
I think she found out
the location of the terrorists.

57:20.333 --> 57:21.600
Stop her before she gets close.

57:22.433 --> 57:23.333
Yes, sir.

57:45.734 --> 57:47.600
I haven't seen Tae-young since yesterday.

57:49.133 --> 57:50.266
If I'm right,

57:50.867 --> 57:54.200
she'll be putting together
the enriched uranium

57:54.266 --> 57:55.700
and the detonator we took from the NSS.

57:56.867 --> 57:59.100
They must have a different hideout
other than here.

58:00.133 --> 58:01.533
Before they install the nuclear device,

58:02.467 --> 58:04.033
we need to find that hideout.

58:24.600 --> 58:25.433
What?

58:25.667 --> 58:27.200
Chul-young Park will be contacting you.

58:28.033 --> 58:30.133
Captain is not supposed to know,
so be careful.

58:45.000 --> 58:45.967
It's me.

58:47.166 --> 58:48.000
Yes.

58:49.533 --> 58:50.800
Eighth street, Riverview...

58:52.633 --> 58:53.767
Yes, sir.

59:15.333 --> 59:16.266
I'm leaving now.

1:02:27.967 --> 1:02:29.266
I don't have time to waste.

1:02:29.433 --> 1:02:31.100
If you don't answer my question right now,

1:02:31.367 --> 1:02:32.333
you will die.

1:02:33.800 --> 1:02:35.433
The enriched uranium and the detonator,

1:02:36.800 --> 1:02:37.767
where are they?
