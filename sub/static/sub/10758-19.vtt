WEBVTT

00:09.176 --> 00:11.386
- Evening, Niles.
- Frasier. Everybody ready?

00:11.553 --> 00:12.971
Just about.

00:13.138 --> 00:14.890
Oh, new cufflinks.
Those are very smart.

00:15.057 --> 00:17.059
Yes, well, you've seen these
before, haven't you?

00:17.225 --> 00:19.061
- I always wear them with a tux.
- Of course.

00:19.269 --> 00:23.231
Well, still, nothing catches the eye
like a sharp pair of cufflinks.

00:25.025 --> 00:26.193
So those are very nice too.

00:26.359 --> 00:27.569
- Oh, these.
- Gold.

00:27.778 --> 00:29.821
I knew you'd wear silver.
I didn't want us to look alike.

00:30.030 --> 00:31.698
No.

00:32.198 --> 00:33.992
- Hello.
- Oh, hi, Roz.

00:34.159 --> 00:35.202
- Hi.
- Come on in.

00:35.368 --> 00:37.078
- Sorry I'm late.
- Well, that's all right.

00:37.245 --> 00:38.288
- Hey, Roz.
- Daphne.

00:38.455 --> 00:40.123
Thank you so much
for watching Alice.

00:40.290 --> 00:42.709
She's way overdue for her nap.
Maybe I can get her to sleep.

00:42.876 --> 00:45.962
Great. We'll set her up in my room.
Don't wanna be late for that auction.

00:46.129 --> 00:48.298
You know, I can't believe
that you donated another day

00:48.465 --> 00:50.634
<i>behind the scenes
of the Frasier Crane Show this year.</i>

00:50.800 --> 00:52.469
Well, why not, Roz?
It's for a good cause.

00:52.635 --> 00:54.888
The Kelly Ann Grunther Foundation
does excellent work.

00:55.096 --> 00:56.348
You weren't trapped in my booth

00:56.514 --> 00:58.641
with that mouth-breather
for three hours last year.

00:58.850 --> 01:01.352
Well, he wasn't that bad.
Some sort of an engineer, wasn't he?

01:01.519 --> 01:04.480
Well, he wasn't a dental hygienist,
that's for sure.

01:05.355 --> 01:08.109
Daphne, can you help me
with these cufflinks?

01:08.318 --> 01:09.611
Oh, all right.

01:09.777 --> 01:12.655
- What is this, Daphne?
- I'm chatting online with Donny.

01:12.822 --> 01:14.949
Oh, what's he saying?

01:15.158 --> 01:20.788
"I can't wait to come home
and see my wittle Engwish cwumpet."

01:21.372 --> 01:24.292
Apparently, he has some sort
of typing impediment.

01:24.751 --> 01:26.586
I don't want him to think
I've abandoned him.

01:26.753 --> 01:28.212
Would you mind taking over?

01:28.379 --> 01:30.214
Tell him I miss him too.

01:30.381 --> 01:32.091
All right.

01:32.258 --> 01:35.344
And I'm counting the days
till he comes home.

01:35.553 --> 01:38.848
And there's no one I love more
than my fuzzy-wuzzy...

01:39.015 --> 01:40.767
<i>Goodbye.</i>

01:41.893 --> 01:44.479
I'm sorry. I seem to have lost him.

01:44.687 --> 01:46.647
- Oh, maybe I can get him back.
- Thank you.

01:46.814 --> 01:48.983
Well, there we are.
Alice is all squared away.

01:49.150 --> 01:51.360
She went right to sleep. Shall we?

01:51.569 --> 01:53.154
Have a good time.
Don't spend too much.

01:53.321 --> 01:54.488
Oh, don't worry about that.

01:54.697 --> 01:56.073
I've got a whole system worked out

01:56.240 --> 01:58.492
where I can get anything I want
for the minimum bid.

01:58.659 --> 02:00.202
That's hardly in keeping
the spirit of the evening.

02:00.411 --> 02:02.747
We're raising money
for the Kelly Ann Grunther Foundation.

02:02.913 --> 02:05.916
Baloney, you just wanna go there so
you can hobnob with all your friends.

02:06.083 --> 02:07.418
- That is not true.
- Oh, yeah?

02:07.585 --> 02:10.795
Well, then answer me one question,
just who is Kelly Ann Grunther?

02:10.963 --> 02:14.008
Kelly Ann Grunther is the person

02:14.175 --> 02:17.303
responsible for
the Kelly Ann Grunther Foundation.

02:17.511 --> 02:18.888
Yes, but what does that mean?

02:19.054 --> 02:21.557
She's a very wealthy person
that put up a lot of money, right?

02:21.765 --> 02:23.309
I thought she had some kind
of disease.

02:23.476 --> 02:25.311
I thought she was a scientist
doing research.

02:25.478 --> 02:27.021
In other words,
it could've been called

02:27.188 --> 02:29.690
the Eddie Eddieman Foundation
as long as there was fancy food

02:29.857 --> 02:31.901
on silver platters.

02:39.199 --> 02:40.743
Do you see anything exciting
to bid on?

02:40.909 --> 02:43.787
Well, no, it's mostly
the same items as last year.

02:43.996 --> 02:46.749
"A day of beauty with
internationally known stylist Raphael."

02:46.915 --> 02:48.667
Yes, I see Missy Cromwell
put down for that.

02:48.834 --> 02:49.877
Well, can you blame her?

02:50.044 --> 02:53.172
Her last day of beauty was during
the Johnson administration.

02:55.132 --> 02:57.092
Actually, Niles,
this is rather interesting.

02:57.259 --> 02:59.052
"The Laureate Luncheon.

02:59.261 --> 03:01.972
Break bread
with three Nobel Prize winners,

03:02.139 --> 03:06.351
Doctors Alan Zafrin,
Jane Randall, and Terence Quinn."

03:06.518 --> 03:08.145
Oh, my.

03:08.353 --> 03:11.440
It's an opportunity to meet with three
of the greatest thinkers of our time.

03:11.607 --> 03:14.026
I'm amazed they even got them all
in the same room together.

03:14.192 --> 03:15.402
Zafrin is a legendary recluse.

03:15.569 --> 03:17.446
Yes, he'll be at Fiddlestix tomorrow
at noon.

03:17.654 --> 03:19.364
- I'll try that.
- Good luck to you, Niles.

03:19.531 --> 03:21.992
- Thank you.
- They say Quinn is quite witty.

03:22.159 --> 03:27.122
In nuclear physics circles, he's
referred to as the half-life of the party.

03:27.539 --> 03:29.499
Well, what do we have at this table?

03:29.666 --> 03:33.545
Oh, the Windsor Monarch 2000, huh?

03:33.754 --> 03:35.547
Isn't this the one they had to recall

03:35.714 --> 03:38.425
because the propane tanks
kept exploding?

03:38.633 --> 03:39.759
- They did?
- Yeah.

03:39.968 --> 03:42.429
I sure feel sorry
for this guy, Martin Crane.

03:42.596 --> 03:46.224
Better get himself an apron
that says "kiss the chef good-bye."

03:52.022 --> 03:53.398
Are you bidding on this one too?

03:53.565 --> 03:56.359
No, no, I'm Roz Doyle,
Frasier Crane's producer.

03:56.526 --> 03:59.195
If you win this, you'll be spending
the afternoon with me.

03:59.404 --> 04:02.615
Well, I hope I do.
I'm a big fan of the show.

04:03.700 --> 04:05.952
Hello there.

04:07.412 --> 04:09.456
Hi, Noel. What are you doing here?

04:09.622 --> 04:12.125
I came to bid
on my favourite auction item.

04:12.333 --> 04:14.752
I should warn you,
lady luck is on my side tonight.

04:14.919 --> 04:16.421
The last guy who rented this tux

04:16.588 --> 04:19.798
left a perfectly good comb
in the pocket.

04:20.341 --> 04:21.634
- May I?
- Oh, gosh.

04:21.801 --> 04:23.553
Oh, there's no pen. I'm sorry, Noel.

04:23.720 --> 04:25.555
No problemo.

04:26.097 --> 04:28.057
I wear one around my neck.

04:31.477 --> 04:33.730
- Oh, damn.
- What is it?

04:33.938 --> 04:36.190
It looks like I have some
competition for this luncheon.

04:36.357 --> 04:40.028
An Alistair Mowbray
doubled my bid to $500.

04:41.279 --> 04:42.864
I've heard that name before.

04:43.030 --> 04:45.199
Yes, you know,
it sounds familiar to me too.

04:45.408 --> 04:48.327
Wait a minute, isn't he that young,
ruthless software tycoon?

04:48.494 --> 04:49.620
- Oh, great.
- Yeah.

04:49.787 --> 04:51.873
There's no use competing
against those deep pockets.

04:52.081 --> 04:53.791
But this vase here deserves
a second look.

04:53.958 --> 04:55.877
Yes, but wait a minute.

04:56.210 --> 04:57.503
Mowbray?

04:57.712 --> 05:00.089
Wasn't that the nom de plume
you used in prep school

05:00.256 --> 05:02.383
for your society column?

05:03.884 --> 05:05.845
What a remarkable coincidence.

05:07.471 --> 05:09.056
You were secretly trying
to outbid me.

05:09.265 --> 05:12.435
All right. I thought if you were bidding
against a stranger, you'd go so high,

05:12.601 --> 05:15.396
but if it was me, then your
childish competitiveness would kick in.

05:15.604 --> 05:17.189
Well, that is nonsense.
Give me the pen.

05:17.356 --> 05:18.858
No, no, I'm saving you
from yourself.

05:19.024 --> 05:20.192
- Give me that.
- I will not.

05:20.359 --> 05:22.737
In the name of Kelly Ann Grunther
and everything she stands for...

05:22.945 --> 05:24.447
- She can't stand.
- How do you know?

05:24.613 --> 05:25.739
I asked.

05:28.617 --> 05:30.452
I can't believe I'm bidding this much.

05:30.619 --> 05:32.913
Don't worry.
We're gonna have so much fun.

05:33.080 --> 05:36.083
It'll be so great being
in that booth together, Roz.

05:36.292 --> 05:38.460
No need to get me
extra headphones.

05:38.627 --> 05:41.005
I'll just share yours.

05:41.171 --> 05:44.800
We are coming up on the final minute
of tonight's auction.

05:45.009 --> 05:48.887
No bids will be accepted
after the whistle blow.

05:49.054 --> 05:50.973
Listen, Jody, can I talk to you?

05:51.181 --> 05:55.769
I'd love to bid more,
but I'm really at my limit.

05:57.855 --> 06:01.817
I really want you to win this.
I really think we would hit it off.

06:02.025 --> 06:03.068
Oh, you too, huh?

06:03.235 --> 06:07.239
I thought I sensed a little spark
between us, Roz.

06:07.447 --> 06:09.324
A spark?

06:09.908 --> 06:13.662
Maybe after the show we could get
a drink or have some dinner?

06:21.378 --> 06:23.797
You like Italian?

06:24.006 --> 06:26.883
Well, I think it's time to separate
the men from the boys.

06:27.092 --> 06:30.220
You will never top this bid.

06:30.387 --> 06:32.180
You're right, Niles. I won't top it.

06:32.931 --> 06:35.600
I will double it.

06:36.977 --> 06:41.231
Then I'd like to see the look
on your face when I double your bid.

06:41.398 --> 06:43.066
What?

06:44.317 --> 06:47.571
You didn't double it.
You just added $50 to it.

06:47.737 --> 06:49.531
Yes!

06:50.031 --> 06:51.283
The geniuses are mine.

06:51.449 --> 06:54.286
Well, there certainly was
some spirited bidding

06:54.452 --> 06:55.954
over this luncheon, wasn't there?

06:56.913 --> 06:58.206
My goodness.

06:58.415 --> 07:02.168
Four thousand, 50 dollars.

07:02.335 --> 07:03.378
What have I done?

07:03.586 --> 07:06.631
You've let your competitiveness get
the better of you. It serves you right.

07:06.798 --> 07:09.843
Due to the overwhelming interest
in this luncheon,

07:10.051 --> 07:12.762
I propose adding another place
to the table.

07:12.971 --> 07:16.474
That is, if we can convince
our runner-up, Dr. Frasier Crane,

07:16.641 --> 07:19.018
to match his brother's generous bid.

07:22.689 --> 07:24.482
What do you say, Dr. Crane?

07:26.276 --> 07:28.403
All right.

07:32.407 --> 07:36.869
Dear God, we've just spent $8000
for a lunch.

07:37.078 --> 07:39.455
Frasier, just try to remember
it's for a very worthy cause.

07:39.622 --> 07:41.374
Thanks to the Doctors Crane,

07:41.541 --> 07:47.672
there will be a lot fewer homeless cats
on the streets of Seattle next year.

07:49.000 --> 07:55.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

07:58.558 --> 07:59.934
- Hey, Daph.
- Hey.

08:00.101 --> 08:01.978
- Have a good time at the auction?
- Oh, yeah.

08:02.144 --> 08:05.982
I got a great new barbecue,
Windsor Monarch 2000.

08:06.190 --> 08:09.277
I wonder if they named it that because
that's the one the royal family uses.

08:09.443 --> 08:10.695
Oh, I'm sure it is.

08:10.861 --> 08:13.114
That's actually the new postage stamp
in England.

08:13.281 --> 08:17.368
Her Majesty with a pair
of barbecue tongs and a sauce brush.

08:19.412 --> 08:22.540
Yes, well, at least Dad didn't have to
go into debt for his purchase.

08:22.748 --> 08:26.252
Oh, yes. Roz told me
about your lunch with the geniuses.

08:26.460 --> 08:29.505
- What? Roz beat us back here?
- Yeah, she was trying to ditch Noel.

08:29.672 --> 08:33.467
Apparently, he's not allowed
onto the highway with his moped.

08:36.095 --> 08:39.347
Frasier, do you ever wonder
why we do all this competition?

08:39.515 --> 08:41.558
Where did it even start?

08:42.809 --> 08:45.104
Well, that's a good question, Niles.

08:45.271 --> 08:47.231
Well, think back.

08:47.398 --> 08:50.025
What is the first thing
you can remember us competing over?

08:50.943 --> 08:52.820
Have to be Mom.

08:53.028 --> 08:55.280
We were always jockeying
for her time and attention.

08:55.447 --> 08:59.118
Yes, well, it was a lot more difficult
for me, actually.

08:59.284 --> 09:02.037
- You being her favourite.
- What?

09:02.246 --> 09:03.288
You were the favourite.

09:03.455 --> 09:05.374
Oh, don't be ridiculous, Niles.
She adored you.

09:05.582 --> 09:07.835
Don't you remember the time
that you lost your tricycle?

09:08.001 --> 09:10.254
She actually took mine away
from me, gave it to you.

09:10.462 --> 09:11.547
That was for your own good.

09:11.713 --> 09:14.716
No 8-year-old
should be riding a tricycle.

09:18.220 --> 09:22.516
I had a chronic ear infection
that affected my balance.

09:23.767 --> 09:26.019
Mom worshipped the ground
you walked on.

09:26.186 --> 09:28.689
Remember when we brought
those bowls home from pottery class,

09:28.855 --> 09:32.317
she used yours for cranberry sauce at
Thanksgiving and mine as a dog dish.

09:32.526 --> 09:35.445
What did you expect her to do?
You painted a little dog right on it.

09:35.946 --> 09:37.989
That was a turkey.

09:40.867 --> 09:44.204
Well, isn't this ironic?

09:44.371 --> 09:46.540
If both of us thinks the other one
was the favourite

09:46.706 --> 09:47.791
then neither of us was.

09:48.041 --> 09:49.709
Oh, so all our competition
was pointless.

09:49.876 --> 09:51.837
Oh, I wish we'd talked about this
years ago.

09:52.003 --> 09:53.046
Oh, Lord, yes.

09:53.213 --> 09:56.049
The angst we could
have spared ourselves.

09:56.258 --> 09:59.094
Do you remember those IQ tests
that we took?

09:59.302 --> 10:02.847
- I was sick waiting for the results.
- Which we never found out, of course.

10:03.014 --> 10:06.351
Mom refused to tell us anything
except that we were two points apart.

10:06.559 --> 10:10.105
- I knew you had the higher score.
- I was convinced you did.

10:10.605 --> 10:11.773
Well,

10:11.940 --> 10:13.483
Mom was certainly right
not to tell us.

10:13.650 --> 10:15.151
Yes, she certainly was.

10:15.360 --> 10:18.655
She knew back then
that we were both too childish

10:18.822 --> 10:21.407
and competitive to handle it.

10:27.747 --> 10:30.875
You know what would be a sign
of real growth, Niles?

10:31.834 --> 10:33.253
To find out those scores right now?

10:33.461 --> 10:35.797
Exactly. How often in life
are you afforded an opportunity

10:35.964 --> 10:38.049
to discover really how much
you've evolved?

10:38.258 --> 10:39.467
Exactly. Dad?

10:40.593 --> 10:42.512
Do you know what our IQs are?

10:42.679 --> 10:46.349
No, but I got a pretty good idea
at that auction tonight.

10:49.936 --> 10:52.271
No, Dad, the IQ tests that we took
when we were children.

10:52.438 --> 10:53.940
- Would you have saved those?
- Sure.

10:54.148 --> 10:57.985
Your mother and I saved all that stuff,
report cards, finger paintings, poems.

10:58.152 --> 11:00.988
It's in an old Ballantine's box
in my closet.

11:01.197 --> 11:02.698
Oh, Dad, why don't you just admit it?

11:02.865 --> 11:04.784
You're more of a sentimentalist
than you let on.

11:04.951 --> 11:06.202
Yeah, I guess I am.

11:06.369 --> 11:07.662
That was the first case of beer

11:07.829 --> 11:10.456
your mother and I
ever bought together.

11:12.792 --> 11:15.378
I still can't get over how much
they spent at that auction.

11:15.544 --> 11:17.713
Oh, they've always tried
to one-up each other.

11:17.880 --> 11:19.715
Yeah, I suppose all brothers
are like that.

11:19.882 --> 11:22.843
Mine certainly were.
Everything was a contest.

11:23.010 --> 11:25.763
Who could run the fastest,
jump the highest.

11:25.971 --> 11:28.891
They even had this strange one
where they'd take little brother Michael,

11:29.058 --> 11:32.186
put him in a potato sack and see
who could bowl him the farthest

11:32.353 --> 11:34.271
over the frozen lake out back.

11:36.232 --> 11:37.608
Oh, they loved that game.

11:37.817 --> 11:40.486
Until that year the spring thaw
set in early,

11:40.653 --> 11:43.447
and poor Michael went right
through the ice.

11:43.614 --> 11:46.408
Oh, they caught hell
for that one, they did.

11:46.575 --> 11:49.870
Caught it worse a week later
when Michael's toe finally fell off.

11:51.664 --> 11:54.250
Michael cried and cried,

11:54.458 --> 11:58.170
till they told him to put it
under his pillow for the Toe Fairy.

11:59.046 --> 12:00.589
Then when he got five quid
for it, why,

12:00.756 --> 12:03.592
it was all they could do to stop him
from sawing off the rest of them.

12:03.801 --> 12:06.678
God, what's keeping you guys
with that box?

12:06.845 --> 12:08.430
Here it is, Dad.

12:08.597 --> 12:11.809
Gosh, this is a virtual treasure trove
of memorabilia.

12:12.017 --> 12:15.562
Can't believe what's in this. Choir
ribbons, Most Improved Badminton.

12:15.729 --> 12:17.689
- Oh, yes.
- The tap dance certificate.

12:17.856 --> 12:20.609
Yeah, I remember going through
that box with your mother.

12:20.776 --> 12:23.278
She always knew just what to say
to cheer me up.

12:23.487 --> 12:28.533
"So what if the trophy says 'Baking'
instead of 'Baseball', Marty.

12:28.700 --> 12:32.996
Catcher's mitts or oven mitts,
they're our little champions."

12:36.708 --> 12:40.671
Now, wait, this is report cards.
This might be something.

12:40.837 --> 12:42.923
Well, here they are.

12:48.845 --> 12:50.764
Congratulations, Frasier.
One twenty-nine.

12:50.931 --> 12:52.265
Is that good?

12:52.432 --> 12:54.434
Oh, good? It's practically genius.
Bravo, Frasier.

12:54.601 --> 12:56.019
Listen up, Niles, now.

12:56.228 --> 12:57.521
Where are you? Higher or lower?

12:57.687 --> 13:00.482
I don't see mine yet. I am...

13:03.151 --> 13:04.736
...higher.

13:04.903 --> 13:09.074
Well, congratulations.
I doff my hat to you, Mr. 131.

13:10.575 --> 13:12.369
Higher.

13:15.163 --> 13:17.707
What do you mean, higher?
Mom told us we were two points apart.

13:17.916 --> 13:20.210
Well, apparently,
Mom was being tactful.

13:20.418 --> 13:21.461
How tactful?

13:21.628 --> 13:23.880
- Well...
- Give me that!

13:27.717 --> 13:31.012
One fifty-six. My God, that's...

13:31.221 --> 13:33.473
- Twenty-seven points.
- Yes, I know!

13:36.100 --> 13:38.019
I never should have told you guys
about the box.

13:38.186 --> 13:39.604
No, no, Dad, I'm fine with this.

13:39.771 --> 13:41.606
The entire point of this exercise
was to prove

13:41.773 --> 13:43.983
that Niles and I have moved
beyond our competitiveness.

13:44.192 --> 13:48.821
And we have.
I'm very proud of my little brother.

13:49.030 --> 13:50.114
Thank you. Thank you.

13:50.323 --> 13:52.909
And I am proud of how mature
you are being about all of this.

13:53.076 --> 13:56.245
In fact, if there were a test for maturity,
I think your score would be much...

13:56.454 --> 13:58.122
Niles, that's enough.

14:00.249 --> 14:04.128
You know what? I suggest that we
go ahead and call it a night, Niles.

14:04.295 --> 14:07.381
We want to be nice and refreshed
for our meeting

14:07.548 --> 14:09.592
with the three geniuses tomorrow.

14:09.759 --> 14:12.803
Or in my case, the four geniuses.

14:13.012 --> 14:15.306
Oh, now, you, well...

14:15.473 --> 14:18.059
Good night, Dad.
Well, I'll meet you at the restaurant.

14:18.226 --> 14:19.727
- Oh, good night, Niles.
- Yeah, okay.

14:19.894 --> 14:22.229
- Sleep tight.
- You too.

14:23.689 --> 14:26.984
Daphne, is that university library
open all night?

14:27.610 --> 14:29.320
I think so. Why do you ask?

14:29.487 --> 14:31.572
Do you think I'd let my little brother
humiliate me?

14:31.739 --> 14:34.575
- What the hell are you talking about?
- Dad, he is smarter than I am.

14:34.742 --> 14:37.787
Niles will be sitting there rambling on
with the geniuses about the cosmos,

14:37.953 --> 14:41.207
black holes, matter, anti-matter,
and I won't matter at all.

14:41.916 --> 14:44.418
I'm going to have to make myself
a nice thermos full of coffee

14:44.585 --> 14:45.753
and get down to that library.

14:45.920 --> 14:48.297
Frasier, what do you think
you're gonna learn in one night?

14:48.464 --> 14:50.716
Just enough to ask
some informed questions, Dad.

14:50.883 --> 14:54.136
I may not have a 156 IQ,
but I am a quick study.

14:54.303 --> 14:56.472
Daphne, is there something wrong
with this coffee pot?

14:56.680 --> 14:57.723
You have to plug it in.

14:57.890 --> 15:00.142
Well, there.
You won't have to tell me that again.

15:08.650 --> 15:09.735
Hello, Niles.

15:09.902 --> 15:12.237
Frasier. Sleep well last night?

15:12.404 --> 15:14.615
Oh, yes. Like a baby.

15:14.823 --> 15:17.868
Like a baby with library privileges.

15:19.620 --> 15:20.662
I know what you did.

15:20.871 --> 15:22.039
How?

15:22.206 --> 15:24.041
The way you rushed me out
of there last night.

15:24.208 --> 15:26.335
I sensed something was up
so I waited in my car,

15:26.502 --> 15:29.046
and sure enough, ten minutes later
you tore out of your garage.

15:29.213 --> 15:30.964
Oh, Niles, I'm so sorry.
It's just that...

15:31.131 --> 15:35.677
No, no, no, I don't wanna hear
any more of your facile excuses.

15:36.386 --> 15:37.429
<i>- Excuse me.
- Gesundheit.</i>

15:37.596 --> 15:41.224
I'm sorry, I think your competitiveness
has sunk to a new low.

15:41.391 --> 15:42.684
Please, I'm ashamed of you.

15:42.893 --> 15:43.977
Please, I'm terribly sorry.

15:44.144 --> 15:48.023
It's just I was so insecure about
even coming to this luncheon at all.

15:48.607 --> 15:49.858
Wait a minute.

15:50.067 --> 15:51.818
You just scratched your ear.

15:52.027 --> 15:53.528
You were at the library too.

15:53.695 --> 15:55.030
I most certainly was not.

15:55.197 --> 15:57.532
The only thing that makes you sneeze
and scratch your ear

15:57.699 --> 15:59.701
is your parchment-mite allergy!

16:01.745 --> 16:05.207
So that was you sneezing
from behind the stacks all night.

16:07.292 --> 16:08.710
Oh, I had to go.

16:08.877 --> 16:11.463
I knew you'd be racing through
those scientific journals faster

16:11.630 --> 16:13.924
than a proton
in a particle accelerator.

16:14.132 --> 16:15.926
Oh, stop showing off.

16:16.092 --> 16:19.137
Speaking of accelerating particles,
do something about that sneezing.

16:19.304 --> 16:22.057
I took some of these before,
but they're not as strong as I thought.

16:22.223 --> 16:24.476
I'm going to take a couple more.

16:33.735 --> 16:37.113
Niles, why don't you just go home
and go to bed?

16:37.322 --> 16:40.116
Oh, that is exactly what you'd like
for me to be happening.

16:41.701 --> 16:43.203
What did you just say?

16:43.703 --> 16:47.749
Well, you didn't repeat it the first time,
I'm not gonna listen to it.

16:48.124 --> 16:50.585
Niles, that medication,
it's affecting your speech.

16:50.752 --> 16:52.253
You've just taken
a second dose of it.

16:52.420 --> 16:54.172
You're gonna
make a fool out of yourself.

16:54.339 --> 16:55.381
Well, you should talk.

16:55.548 --> 16:58.217
Look at your shaking hands
and your twitchy eyes.

16:58.426 --> 17:01.095
You were up all night drinking coffee
all last night, weren't you?

17:01.304 --> 17:04.390
I am not twitching.
You will not psych me into twitching.

17:04.557 --> 17:07.977
Gentlemen, may I offer you a...?

17:08.144 --> 17:11.396
- Sir, is your eye bothering you?
- No, no, it's fine.

17:11.564 --> 17:12.898
Can I get you something to drink?

17:13.065 --> 17:16.402
No, thank you.
Well, yes, some coffee. Decaf.

17:16.611 --> 17:19.614
I'd like a cup of tea sounds nice.

17:21.406 --> 17:22.867
- Very good.
- You know what, Niles?

17:23.034 --> 17:25.744
You really should leave.
You're embarrassing yourself.

17:26.579 --> 17:27.788
For God's sakes.

17:27.997 --> 17:30.166
I'm never leaving
while you're still not leaving.

17:30.333 --> 17:34.045
You know you had the good bed.

17:34.503 --> 17:36.005
Well, now, you're just hallucinating.

17:36.172 --> 17:37.965
No, when we moved
to Wallace Lane,

17:38.174 --> 17:39.759
and we shared a room
and you got to pick

17:39.925 --> 17:42.845
where you would be having
your sleeping.

17:43.429 --> 17:45.890
Niles, the beds were identical.

17:46.098 --> 17:47.641
Why am I even bothering
to explain this

17:47.808 --> 17:50.102
to a man who has his elbow
in the butter?

17:51.145 --> 17:54.231
Well, who is hallucinationing now?

17:54.648 --> 17:56.692
Niles, have you ever taken
these pills before?

17:56.859 --> 17:59.486
No, but they fixed my nose.

17:59.695 --> 18:01.572
No, I just wish they wouldn't
make me so hyper.

18:01.739 --> 18:03.115
Yes. Oh, good Lord!

18:03.282 --> 18:06.368
For God's sakes, you spilled water
all over me, you jackass.

18:06.577 --> 18:08.579
- Here, just give me another napkin.
- Oh, napkin.

18:08.746 --> 18:11.999
- Give me, give me, give me that!
- Napkin, napkin, napkin.

18:12.624 --> 18:15.169
- Oh, Niles, wake up, wake up.
- Excuse me.

18:16.253 --> 18:18.047
Oh, Dr. Zafrin.

18:18.213 --> 18:20.507
Goodness, this is quite an honour.

18:20.674 --> 18:22.968
Here, allow me.

18:33.395 --> 18:36.398
Allow me to introduce
Dr. Niles Crane.

18:48.744 --> 18:51.413
Well, Niles,
I'm surprised to see you up so soon.

18:52.372 --> 18:53.457
You feel all right?

18:53.665 --> 18:56.418
I feel not bad. A little dry.

18:56.585 --> 18:58.253
When I blink,
it makes a scratching noise.

18:58.420 --> 19:00.172
Well, here.

19:00.380 --> 19:02.090
Let me get you a little water here.

19:02.257 --> 19:03.592
- Well, thank you.
- Here we are.

19:03.758 --> 19:07.596
So how long did we last
at the lunch?

19:07.762 --> 19:09.264
Well, not too long.

19:09.472 --> 19:14.185
Nine thousand dollars doesn't buy you
the leisurely lunch it used to.

19:15.145 --> 19:16.646
Wait a minute.
I thought it was 8000.

19:16.813 --> 19:19.482
No, no, no, you knocked
over the aquarium on the way out.

19:22.902 --> 19:25.864
You know, if ever I feel envy
about your IQ again,

19:26.031 --> 19:30.368
I'll just conjure up the image of you
sprawled out on a bed of live koi,

19:31.453 --> 19:35.915
weeping and desperately trying
to revive that little plastic diver.

19:39.252 --> 19:40.712
Oh, dear God.

19:40.920 --> 19:43.590
Hurry up with those patties.
I got five more pounds in the fridge.

19:43.756 --> 19:45.383
Right, Dad.

19:45.550 --> 19:48.094
Dad's having his poker chums over
to test out the new barbecue.

19:48.261 --> 19:49.512
You can give me a hand here.

19:49.721 --> 19:54.225
Is it gonna end, Frasier?
All this obsessive competitiveness.

19:54.434 --> 19:58.187
Oh, probably never, Niles.

19:58.396 --> 19:59.564
You know, whether it started

19:59.731 --> 20:01.899
with seeking Mom's approval
or some other insecurity,

20:02.066 --> 20:05.320
we're locked in a pattern now
that we'll probably never get out of.

20:05.486 --> 20:07.363
- That sounds bleak.
- No, no, not necessarily.

20:07.530 --> 20:09.949
- There have been some benefits to it.
- What?

20:10.158 --> 20:12.034
I probably wouldn't have done
so well in school

20:12.201 --> 20:14.412
if it hadn't been for my fear
that I'd be bested

20:14.579 --> 20:16.956
by my brainy little brother.

20:18.875 --> 20:22.503
Well, I was certainly spurred on
by your success as well.

20:22.712 --> 20:26.132
Why else would I have joined the chess
club, the drama club and the key club?

20:26.340 --> 20:28.426
And what other possible reason
would there be for me

20:28.593 --> 20:31.470
to spend an entire summer training
a seeing-eye dog?

20:31.637 --> 20:33.973
Aside from helping the blind.

20:34.724 --> 20:35.766
You know what?

20:35.975 --> 20:40.980
I might not have pushed myself on
to Harvard and Oxford.

20:41.897 --> 20:44.358
Well, I might not have been led
to psychiatry,

20:44.525 --> 20:47.319
which has been the saving grace
of my life.

20:48.070 --> 20:49.447
You see, Niles, frankly,

20:49.613 --> 20:51.866
we both have a lot to thank
each other for.

20:52.032 --> 20:53.951
We've come a long way
from those two little boys

20:54.160 --> 20:57.496
just starving for a parent's approval.

20:57.663 --> 20:59.707
- How are they coming?
- Oh, just great, Dad.

20:59.874 --> 21:01.709
- We're going as fast as we can.
- Here you are.

21:01.876 --> 21:04.712
- Nice job on those patties.
- Thank you.

21:04.920 --> 21:06.130
- Really? You think so?
- Yeah.

21:06.297 --> 21:10.217
Not too thick, not too thin,
tight enough to hold their shape.

21:10.384 --> 21:11.635
Perfect.

21:11.802 --> 21:13.262
Well, thank you, Dad.

21:13.429 --> 21:16.432
- Yeah, wait till you see the next batch.
- Yeah.

21:18.434 --> 21:20.978
You know, I'm surprised
you let him keep that out there.

21:21.145 --> 21:25.733
Oh, well, yeah. It's a bit of an eyesore
and, frankly, kind of a fire hazard,

21:25.899 --> 21:27.776
but what the hell,
it makes him happy.

21:27.985 --> 21:29.945
Lodged an anonymous complaint
with the building?

21:30.154 --> 21:32.197
- It'll be gone by Thursday.
- That's nice.
