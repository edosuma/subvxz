00:00.586 --> 00:02.442
<i>Previously on "Heartland":</i>

00:08.585 --> 00:09.451
<i>Hey, Scott?</i>

00:09.519 --> 00:10.519
- Hey.
- Hey.

00:10.587 --> 00:11.153
Great to have you on board.

00:11.221 --> 00:12.587
Good to be here.

00:12.655 --> 00:15.122
Our club vet moved east
and we've been struggling.

00:15.191 --> 00:17.559
And I found myself a star -
best jockey I've ever seen.

00:17.626 --> 00:19.360
Rode Lightning Dexter
to five wins in a row.

00:19.428 --> 00:21.329
So who knows?
Maybe it's the Derby next.

00:23.299 --> 00:24.699
Lou!

00:24.766 --> 00:26.301
<i>I don't believe it!</i>

00:26.368 --> 00:28.069
What are you doing here?!

00:30.000 --> 00:36.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:53.327 --> 00:54.627
Yeah!

00:56.996 --> 00:59.298
Good shot, Nick!

01:03.236 --> 01:03.935
Hey, guys.

01:04.001 --> 01:04.869
Hey.
Hey.

01:04.937 --> 01:06.037
Glad you could make it, Amy.

01:06.105 --> 01:07.171
Oh, no problem.
It's gotta be quick though,

01:07.240 --> 01:08.707
'cause I want to spend
some time with Lou.

01:08.774 --> 01:09.708
Lou's back?

01:09.775 --> 01:10.808
Yeah.

01:10.876 --> 01:11.710
Is everything okay?
Oh yeah.

01:11.777 --> 01:12.944
Yeah, she's great.

01:13.011 --> 01:13.945
She's just back
for a short visit.

01:14.012 --> 01:15.380
Oh, good.

01:15.448 --> 01:16.714
Well, hey, we're having
this welcome home dinner

01:16.781 --> 01:18.014
For her on Friday.

01:18.082 --> 01:21.652
You should come by.
Mmm. Yeah, maybe.

01:22.654 --> 01:23.554
That's the one.

01:23.622 --> 01:26.056
<i>Nick Harwell's horse.</i>

01:26.124 --> 01:27.558
He's cribbing?

01:27.626 --> 01:28.626
Yeah, and he hasn't just
been biting his stalls.

01:28.693 --> 01:30.728
He got my hand the other day.

01:30.795 --> 01:32.295
Well, those usually
aren't related.

01:32.363 --> 01:33.696
Yeah, that's why I wanted you
to check him out.

01:33.764 --> 01:35.365
He's usually a good horse,

01:35.432 --> 01:38.401
But all of a sudden he's having
all of these issues.

01:38.469 --> 01:40.035
Well, has anything changed
in his routine?

01:40.103 --> 01:41.671
They've been training him
pretty hard.

01:41.739 --> 01:42.739
They've got a bit match
this weekend

01:42.806 --> 01:44.540
<i>Against some hotshot team.</i>

01:44.608 --> 01:46.142
<i>Yeah, we've
been out here a lot.</i>

01:46.209 --> 01:48.010
Quite a few injuries.

01:51.481 --> 01:52.648
<i>- Hey, Nick.
- Hey.</i>

01:52.715 --> 01:54.716
Great practice.
They had real jump today,

01:54.784 --> 01:56.918
Especially Dusty here, huh?

01:56.986 --> 01:58.253
Hey, boy?

01:58.321 --> 02:00.155
We gonna kick some butt
this weekend?

02:00.222 --> 02:01.156
Yeah, absolutely.

02:27.648 --> 02:29.015
Morning, sweetie,

02:29.082 --> 02:31.351
Or evening for you I guess.

02:32.286 --> 02:36.055
You're probably still
at your business dinner.

02:36.123 --> 02:37.690
I miss you.

02:37.757 --> 02:40.659
Waking up without you
feels weird.

02:40.727 --> 02:42.294
Okay, give me a call
when you get in.

02:42.362 --> 02:43.429
I love you.

02:56.975 --> 02:57.875
Grampa.

02:57.943 --> 02:58.876
Hmm?

02:58.944 --> 03:01.245
That is not how we do it.

03:01.313 --> 03:03.013
Well, good morning to you too.

03:03.081 --> 03:04.849
I left you specific
instructions

03:04.916 --> 03:06.551
On how to use
the bookkeeping program

03:06.618 --> 03:07.985
On the computer.

03:08.053 --> 03:10.787
Come on, Lou.
You know that typing

03:10.855 --> 03:12.222
Is not my strong suit.

03:12.289 --> 03:14.791
Yeah, apparently neither
is penmanship.

03:15.893 --> 03:17.527
Oh, I sure did miss that fire,

03:17.595 --> 03:19.463
Even though I'm the one
getting burned.

03:19.530 --> 03:21.197
I missed you too.

03:22.132 --> 03:25.434
Your dad wants us at the track
by 10:00.

03:25.502 --> 03:26.702
Oh, all right.

03:26.770 --> 03:28.437
I'll hop in the shower.

03:31.274 --> 03:33.208
<i>Aw, Grampa,
could you rinse out the sink</i>

03:33.276 --> 03:35.644
<i>When you trim your moustache?</i>

03:40.416 --> 03:42.350
That's a lot of damage
to the wood.

03:42.418 --> 03:43.918
How long's he been
doing this for?

03:43.986 --> 03:45.086
A week.

03:46.021 --> 03:47.355
Amy Fleming.

03:47.423 --> 03:48.322
Hey, Nick.

03:48.391 --> 03:49.624
What're you doing here?

03:49.692 --> 03:51.225
Well, Scott asked me to come by

03:51.293 --> 03:53.327
<i>And check out Dusty.</i>

03:53.396 --> 03:54.662
Well, it's good of you
to come by,

03:54.730 --> 03:55.963
But I don't think
there's anything too serious.

03:57.532 --> 03:58.399
Easy, boy.

04:00.134 --> 04:01.368
<i>Watch his head!</i>

04:04.439 --> 04:05.672
<i>Ty!</i>

04:06.875 --> 04:08.442
<i>Easy now, boy.</i>

04:08.510 --> 04:09.676
You all right?

04:09.744 --> 04:10.811
I'm fine.

such a hot streak.

05:16.573 --> 05:18.807
Dad, your jockey, he's amazing!

05:18.875 --> 05:20.542
Oh yeah.

05:23.446 --> 05:25.681
Hey, meet my jockey.

05:26.683 --> 05:27.749
Janice Wayne.

05:30.119 --> 05:32.020
Hey, nice to meet you.

05:35.524 --> 05:38.125
Well, dad, thanks
for having us out.

05:38.193 --> 05:39.126
That was really cool.

05:39.194 --> 05:39.961
Well, thanks for coming.

05:40.028 --> 05:41.362
Yeah.

05:41.429 --> 05:42.363
I'm proud of you.

05:42.430 --> 05:43.831
Oh, good.

05:43.899 --> 05:45.299
Well, I'll see you two tonight
and we'll talk about it.

05:45.367 --> 05:46.333
Uh, nice to meet you.

05:46.401 --> 05:48.202
<i>See ya.</i>

05:56.978 --> 05:58.144
Wow.

05:58.212 --> 05:59.546
So, how'd you feel
on those turns?

05:59.614 --> 06:00.847
Good.
Really good.

06:00.915 --> 06:01.915
Well, you looked really good.

06:01.983 --> 06:02.883
Mmm... Did I?

06:02.950 --> 06:04.017
Mm-hmm.

06:05.719 --> 06:07.452
Come on, boy.

06:12.025 --> 06:14.359
Okay, uh, we have to stop
doing this at the track,

06:14.427 --> 06:15.661
And what was with
the cheering section?

06:15.729 --> 06:17.663
Oh, I just wanted my family
to come out,

06:17.731 --> 06:18.964
I don't know, see my new team.

06:19.032 --> 06:20.132
They were very impressed.

06:20.199 --> 06:21.432
And so they should be;

06:21.500 --> 06:23.067
That was one hell
of a training run.

06:23.135 --> 06:24.836
Mmm.

06:24.904 --> 06:26.905
I told them you'd come
for dinner tonight.

06:26.972 --> 06:28.305
No.

06:28.373 --> 06:29.641
It's too soon, Tim.
I told you this, okay?

06:29.708 --> 06:30.542
We've gotta be discreet
if we...

06:30.609 --> 06:31.676
Oh, come on.

06:32.745 --> 06:34.211
I'm serious, okay?!

06:34.279 --> 06:35.747
It's tough enough being
a female jockey.

06:35.814 --> 06:37.347
I don't need everyone knowing
I'm dating an owner.

06:37.415 --> 06:38.649
Okay.

06:38.716 --> 06:40.050
It could be a career killer.

06:40.117 --> 06:41.885
Okay, I get it.

06:41.953 --> 06:43.119
Good.

06:43.187 --> 06:45.187
Except I already told them
you're coming.

06:49.827 --> 06:52.262
So what was that all about?

06:52.329 --> 06:53.896
Dusty loves being
out in the field.

06:53.964 --> 06:55.665
I guess he wasn't ready
to come in.

06:55.732 --> 06:57.600
Well, has he ever done
anything like this before?

06:57.668 --> 07:00.169
He almost pulled my arm
out of my socket yesterday.

07:00.236 --> 07:02.438
I thought Amy might
have some ideas.

07:02.505 --> 07:03.839
Well, I'd love to take
a look at him.

07:03.907 --> 07:05.975
Uh... Not right now.

07:06.043 --> 07:07.610
Maybe after the tournament
in Florida.

07:07.678 --> 07:09.477
Won't it be tough
to trailer him like this?

07:09.545 --> 07:11.245
He'll be fine.

07:12.181 --> 07:13.081
Hey, Nick?

07:13.148 --> 07:15.116
Mm-hmm?
Um...

07:15.184 --> 07:16.818
You know, if you wanted
to bring him by tomorrow

07:16.886 --> 07:18.053
I cleared all my appointments

07:18.120 --> 07:19.320
So I could spend
the day with Lou,

07:19.388 --> 07:21.389
But I could take
a couple hours with him.

07:21.457 --> 07:22.423
Lou's back?

07:22.491 --> 07:23.858
Yeah, just for a visit.

07:23.926 --> 07:25.158
Ah, good.

07:26.094 --> 07:27.160
Well, maybe I could
bring Dusty by

07:27.228 --> 07:28.428
For a quick look.

07:28.496 --> 07:29.563
It couldn't hurt.

07:29.631 --> 07:31.932
Yeah. Okay, thanks.

07:33.334 --> 07:35.168
Caleb Odell!

07:35.236 --> 07:36.637
Lou! Hey, welcome home!

07:36.705 --> 07:38.338
Thanks.
Good to see ya.

07:38.406 --> 07:39.640
Hey, uh...

07:39.708 --> 07:41.975
I'm sorry I missed your wedding,
but...

07:42.042 --> 07:43.476
Well, I was kind of getting
married myself.

07:43.543 --> 07:45.277
So I heard.

07:45.345 --> 07:48.280
Congratulations.
You look like a happy man.

07:48.348 --> 07:49.782
Ah, yes I am.

07:49.850 --> 07:52.251
Well, I gotta go water
the horses.

07:59.926 --> 08:00.792
What?

08:00.860 --> 08:02.427
You know what.

08:02.495 --> 08:04.830
I thought we agreed to finally
to leave the stone age

08:04.897 --> 08:07.432
And install an automatic
watering system.

08:07.500 --> 08:09.835
Barn hose and pails have
been workin' just fine.

08:09.902 --> 08:12.170
Grampa, you are not getting
any younger.

08:12.238 --> 08:14.471
Do you really want to be
lugging around water buckets

08:14.539 --> 08:15.472
<i>In five years?</i>

08:15.540 --> 08:16.941
Thanks for your concern, Lou,

08:17.009 --> 08:19.010
But I'm not ready for
the home just yet.

08:19.077 --> 08:21.045
We agreed to put it in.

08:21.113 --> 08:22.747
We?
Yes!

08:22.814 --> 08:23.914
But since that "we"

08:23.982 --> 08:25.783
Turned into "me"
runnin' this place,

08:25.851 --> 08:28.619
I figure we could do things
the way I see fit.

08:28.686 --> 08:30.386
It would only be like $500

08:30.454 --> 08:32.054
And installing it
would only cost...

08:32.123 --> 08:35.558
We are not paying
for someone else to install it.

08:35.626 --> 08:36.626
If we do this,

08:36.693 --> 08:38.693
We'll be putting it in
ourselves.

08:38.761 --> 08:39.828
Good.

08:44.467 --> 08:46.401
<i>Where are the mixing bowls?</i>

08:46.469 --> 08:47.803
I don't know.

08:47.871 --> 08:49.437
And the loaf pans?

08:49.505 --> 08:50.706
Not sure.

08:50.774 --> 08:52.975
You know,
my kitchen used to have order.

08:53.043 --> 08:55.843
Now it's just stuffed
like Grampa's tackle box.

08:58.814 --> 09:00.014
What's going on?

09:00.082 --> 09:02.650
Lou's OCD is acting up again.

09:02.718 --> 09:03.918
How am I
supposed to cook anything

09:03.986 --> 09:05.486
When I don't know where
anything is.

09:05.554 --> 09:07.955
Relax, Lou, dinner's already
ready for tonight.

09:08.023 --> 09:09.123
Grampa's stew?

09:09.191 --> 09:10.791
You guys are going
all out for me.

09:10.858 --> 09:12.793
Yeah, well, your official
"welcome home dinner"

09:12.860 --> 09:13.894
Isn't for a couple days.

09:13.961 --> 09:15.862
Well, I will be cooking
that one.

09:17.231 --> 09:19.599
I've got a few new recipes
I want to try out.

09:19.667 --> 09:21.568
You're really embracing
the culture I see.

09:21.635 --> 09:22.803
Yeah.

09:22.870 --> 09:25.271
Dubai is so fascinating.
It's like...

09:25.339 --> 09:26.472
You wouldn't think it,

09:26.540 --> 09:28.373
But it's a really
romantic place.

09:28.441 --> 09:30.342
It's like we're on
this extended honeymoon.

09:30.410 --> 09:33.312
Isn't Peter working
like all the time?

09:33.379 --> 09:35.581
Not all the time.

09:35.648 --> 09:37.750
And when he does I hang out
with my women's club.

09:37.818 --> 09:39.752
So what kind of things
do you do?

09:39.820 --> 09:40.753
What don't we do?

09:40.821 --> 09:41.821
We um...

09:41.888 --> 09:44.889
Rent yachts, work out, shop,

09:44.957 --> 09:45.957
Go to the museum,

09:46.025 --> 09:47.992
Work out, shop,
hit the beach...

09:48.060 --> 09:50.962
Sounds like
a permanent vacation.

09:51.030 --> 09:53.932
I'm loving it.
It's awesome.

09:58.604 --> 09:59.770
<i>You said six feet.</i>

09:59.838 --> 10:01.138
You do know what a foot is?

10:01.206 --> 10:03.573
It looks like six, doesn't it?

10:03.641 --> 10:04.674
<i>Hey guys.</i>

10:04.743 --> 10:06.343
What's going on here?

10:06.410 --> 10:07.477
<i>Well, Lou,</i>

10:07.545 --> 10:10.214
Wants me to cut down
on manual labour

10:10.281 --> 10:11.982
by having me dig a ditch.

10:12.050 --> 10:13.683
It's the new horse
watering system.

10:13.752 --> 10:15.384
She's still on about that, huh?

10:16.820 --> 10:19.622
Did you guys dig this trench
with shovels?

10:19.689 --> 10:22.158
Well, I'm not gonna rent
a backhoe for $300 an hour!

10:23.227 --> 10:24.326
<i>I'm gonna need you
to help me run</i>

10:24.394 --> 10:26.629
That water line tomorrow.

10:26.696 --> 10:27.764
Uh, sorry, Jack,

10:27.831 --> 10:29.031
I'm working with Scott
tomorrow.

10:29.099 --> 10:31.767
It's okay.
I've got the day free, so...

10:31.834 --> 10:34.236
Yeah, that's a real comfort.

10:36.405 --> 10:38.539
Jack

10:41.043 --> 10:42.177
<i>- Hey!
- Hi girls!</i>

10:42.245 --> 10:43.611
Hi.

10:43.679 --> 10:45.113
Oh, it smells
like Grampa's stew.

10:45.181 --> 10:47.148
It's a good thing you brought
your vegetarian dish.

10:47.215 --> 10:48.482
Oh, you didn't have
to bring anything.

10:48.549 --> 10:49.984
I have a really strict
training diet

10:50.051 --> 10:51.285
So I always pack my own meal.

10:51.352 --> 10:54.255
Oh, wow, uh,
I'll put this on the table.

10:54.322 --> 10:55.656
Hi. Amy.

10:55.723 --> 10:56.456
Hey, Janice.
Nice to meet you.

10:56.524 --> 10:57.925
Hi.
Nice to meet you.

10:57.993 --> 10:59.459
- I'm Ty. Nice to meet you.
- Hey, what's up?

10:59.527 --> 11:02.996
Well, come on in.
I'll introduce to the others.

11:03.063 --> 11:04.230
Good grip for a 100 pounder.

11:04.298 --> 11:05.765
No kidding.

11:07.634 --> 11:09.368
So thanks so much
for the dinner invite.

11:09.436 --> 11:10.503
No problem.

11:10.570 --> 11:12.305
It was Tim's idea, actually,

11:12.372 --> 11:14.440
But nice to have you by.

11:15.742 --> 11:17.877
So that was an incredible
session this morning,

11:17.945 --> 11:19.611
I must say.

11:19.679 --> 11:22.781
Grampa were pretty shocked
when you took off your helmut.

11:22.849 --> 11:24.216
And why would it shock you

11:24.284 --> 11:25.650
That a woman could ride
like that?

11:26.585 --> 11:27.920
<i>Oh, um...</i>

11:27.987 --> 11:30.322
No, I didn't mean...
It's just...

11:30.389 --> 11:31.723
You don't see many
female jockeys,

11:31.791 --> 11:33.058
That's all.

11:33.126 --> 11:35.060
The track seems like
such a boy's club.

11:35.128 --> 11:36.894
Yeah, well you gain access
pretty quick

11:36.962 --> 11:38.697
When you start kicking
all the boy's butts.

11:41.967 --> 11:44.569
So, uh, where are you from?

11:44.637 --> 11:45.937
Vancouver,

11:46.004 --> 11:47.305
But I've been in California
for a long time now.

11:47.373 --> 11:50.074
You left the sun,
beach and palm trees

11:50.142 --> 11:51.842
To come to Hudson?

11:51.909 --> 11:54.511
Uh, well, I do miss
it a lot, but, um, you know,

11:54.579 --> 11:58.716
Dexter's a real good horse
and Tim's a great boss.

11:58.783 --> 12:00.617
Well, you're a great rider.

12:00.685 --> 12:03.354
You should have seen her ride
against Dexter in Monterey.

12:03.421 --> 12:05.088
I mean, she was on a real nag.

12:05.156 --> 12:07.957
She just buried my jockey.
We didn't stand a chance.

12:08.024 --> 12:11.193
That's when I knew
I had to have her.

12:11.261 --> 12:13.162
Riding Dexter.

12:13.230 --> 12:15.197
Uh, you know, there's a lot
of shady people in this racket,

12:15.265 --> 12:17.032
So it's just nice to be
working for someone

12:17.100 --> 12:19.502
Who isn't just looking
to make a quick buck.

12:19.570 --> 12:20.803
That right?

12:20.871 --> 12:22.037
<i>Oh my god.</i>

12:22.105 --> 12:24.138
I missed you guys,
you know that?

12:24.206 --> 12:27.442
Almost as much as I missed
the fresh mountain air.

12:27.510 --> 12:29.277
I cannot wait to go
for a run tomorrow.

12:29.345 --> 12:30.812
Guess who runs?

12:30.880 --> 12:32.113
<i>Janice.</i>

12:32.181 --> 12:33.815
You should run together,
tomorrow.

12:33.883 --> 12:35.283
<i>It's good to run with company.</i>

12:35.351 --> 12:36.284
Oh...

12:36.352 --> 12:37.786
Uh, yeah, sure.

12:41.122 --> 12:43.190
Um, let's meet here.

12:43.258 --> 12:44.658
I'm gonna run up
to the dude ranch.

12:44.726 --> 12:47.762
<i>Sure. Cool. Great.</i>

12:49.598 --> 12:50.664
I look forward to seeing
you on the track, Janice.

12:50.732 --> 12:51.899
Nice meeting you all.

12:51.966 --> 12:52.666
I'm gonna catch up to you.

12:52.734 --> 12:53.501
Okay.

12:56.804 --> 12:58.772
What do you think?

12:58.839 --> 13:00.407
About what?

13:00.474 --> 13:01.941
About Janice?

13:02.009 --> 13:05.244
Well, she seems driven
and tough.

13:06.414 --> 13:08.247
I guess that's good to have
in a jockey.

13:08.315 --> 13:10.750
Mm-hmm.
Well, I'm glad you like her.

13:10.818 --> 13:13.552
Since when do you care about
my opinion of your rider?

13:13.620 --> 13:16.388
I wouldn't ask you
if I didn't care, Jack.

13:16.456 --> 13:17.523
I'm just thinking about
keeping her around,

13:17.590 --> 13:19.057
That's all.

13:24.898 --> 13:26.565
Nice trail.

13:26.633 --> 13:30.067
Yeah, I've been running
here since I was a kid.

13:30.135 --> 13:33.070
This is where is started
training for cross country.

13:33.138 --> 13:34.739
Oh yeah? You ran cross country?

13:34.807 --> 13:37.742
Yeah.
Back in grade 8,

13:37.810 --> 13:40.311
I came in second
at the Hudson run

13:40.378 --> 13:41.512
But everyone knows

13:41.580 --> 13:43.680
Mary Jane Sutcliff
jumped the gun so...

13:45.950 --> 13:47.016
You?

13:47.084 --> 13:48.885
Yeah, I was an All-Canadian
at UBC

13:48.953 --> 13:51.020
Three years on a row.

13:51.088 --> 13:52.489
Oh.

13:52.557 --> 13:53.623
All-Canadian.

13:54.926 --> 13:55.992
Three years.

13:57.962 --> 14:01.296
So, you miss California?

14:02.231 --> 14:03.833
Of course,

14:03.900 --> 14:06.569
But Tim's made the move
a lot easier to take, you know?

14:06.636 --> 14:08.270
We're having a lot of fun
at the track

14:08.338 --> 14:10.873
And he just has such a great
head for business, you know?

14:10.941 --> 14:12.040
Oh yeah.

14:12.108 --> 14:13.342
Wait till you see
our dude ranch.

14:13.409 --> 14:14.743
It's uh...

14:14.811 --> 14:17.144
It's a got a country chic feel.

14:17.212 --> 14:18.847
Yeah, by the
sounds of this place,

14:18.914 --> 14:20.147
You must have been

14:20.215 --> 14:21.850
A really good
business woman before.

14:21.917 --> 14:23.150
Before?

14:23.218 --> 14:24.552
Well, yeah,
before you married into,

14:24.620 --> 14:26.087
You know,
different circumstances.

14:26.154 --> 14:27.689
I'm sure it's more
of a hobby now.

14:29.558 --> 14:31.459
Hey, you want me to drop
the pace a little?

14:31.526 --> 14:33.126
No, no, I'm good.

14:33.194 --> 14:34.995
Uh, it's just around
the bend there.

14:35.062 --> 14:36.930
All right, I'll race you there.

14:54.214 --> 14:55.381
Hmm...

14:55.448 --> 14:56.582
You know,
the cattle make it seem

14:56.650 --> 14:59.151
A little more country
than chic.

15:09.134 --> 15:10.200
<i>Hey!</i>

15:11.503 --> 15:12.737
Lou...

15:12.804 --> 15:14.739
Now before you say anything
it's temporary.

15:14.806 --> 15:17.107
Temporarily what?!

15:17.174 --> 15:18.875
After you left,
I decided to have it winterized

15:18.943 --> 15:20.010
For the winter.

15:20.077 --> 15:22.012
It's spring now, dad!

15:22.079 --> 15:24.213
You know, I'm just gonna...

15:25.449 --> 15:26.883
Well, it wasn't like we were
getting any bookings.

15:26.951 --> 15:28.985
For a boarded up cabin?
Big surprise!

15:29.053 --> 15:30.319
It didn't make sense.

15:30.387 --> 15:32.955
Dad, how can you just let it
sit here like this

15:33.023 --> 15:34.322
After all the work we did?!

15:34.390 --> 15:36.191
I mean, look at it!

15:36.259 --> 15:38.560
Well, when you took off
I just, I don't know.

15:38.628 --> 15:40.095
What am I supposed to do,
run it myself?

15:40.163 --> 15:41.697
I can help you from Dubai!

15:41.765 --> 15:43.632
There's this little thing
called the internet.

15:43.700 --> 15:44.767
They have that there?

15:44.834 --> 15:47.169
Dad...

15:47.236 --> 15:49.704
Look I've got a few days
before I go.

15:49.772 --> 15:52.006
I'm gonna get this place
cleaned up so we can open,

15:52.074 --> 15:54.042
But I need you to be
more hands on, okay?

15:54.109 --> 15:55.043
Yeah.

15:55.110 --> 15:56.044
Deal?
Deal.

15:56.111 --> 15:57.011
<i>Hey, Tim?</i>

15:57.079 --> 15:58.279
Yeah?

15:58.346 --> 15:59.547
Hey, we gotta get back
to the track.

15:59.614 --> 16:00.314
I'll pick up my truck
at the ranch later?

16:00.382 --> 16:01.448
Uh, okay.

16:01.516 --> 16:03.250
<i>Bye, Lou.</i>

16:04.185 --> 16:05.385
What do you think?
She's great, huh?

16:05.452 --> 16:07.420
Yeah, she's great.
Just ask her.

16:07.488 --> 16:09.156
Bossy! I like that.

16:09.223 --> 16:12.192
I guess a little arrogance
is a good thing in a jockey.

16:12.259 --> 16:14.427
Yeah. Um, I gotta run.

16:14.495 --> 16:16.697
Ach!

16:16.764 --> 16:17.664
You need a ride?

16:17.732 --> 16:19.732
Uh, no, I'm gonna run back.

16:19.800 --> 16:21.701
Okay, all right.

16:27.741 --> 16:28.908
Hey, Nick.

16:28.975 --> 16:30.442
How's Dusty this morning?

16:30.510 --> 16:31.610
Really good practice.

16:31.678 --> 16:33.645
Good.
How was he in the trailer?

16:33.714 --> 16:35.880
Not bad.
A little restless.

16:35.948 --> 16:37.949
Okay, well,
how long do I have with him?

16:38.017 --> 16:39.818
I have to get him back
for his afternoon exercise,

16:39.885 --> 16:40.852
So not long.

16:40.920 --> 16:42.721
Amy!

16:42.788 --> 16:44.622
Why didn't you
tell me about the dude ranch?

16:44.690 --> 16:45.623
Hey, Nick.

16:45.691 --> 16:46.825
Hey, Lou.

16:46.892 --> 16:48.059
Hey.
What are you doing here?

16:48.127 --> 16:50.595
Uh, Amy is just giving
my horse the once over.

16:50.662 --> 16:52.830
You know, why don't I exercise
him for ya?

16:52.897 --> 16:54.431
That'll give me a chance
to spend more time with him

16:54.498 --> 16:56.834
And maybe you guys
could grab a cofee?

16:56.901 --> 16:58.401
Coffee would be nice.

16:58.469 --> 16:59.937
Yeah, sure.

17:00.471 --> 17:02.806
- Okay.
- Yeah, just um...

17:02.874 --> 17:04.007
Give him a walk trot.

17:04.075 --> 17:05.876
Yeah, of course.

17:12.182 --> 17:13.648
Hey, Dusty.

17:21.358 --> 17:22.691
Good boy.

17:25.728 --> 17:28.663
You're okay.

17:49.517 --> 17:50.818
Good boy.

17:54.823 --> 17:56.956
Good boy.

18:06.867 --> 18:08.401
Hey, hey, easy, easy!

18:09.036 --> 18:11.137
Hey! Hey!

18:14.908 --> 18:16.275
Easy.

18:16.342 --> 18:17.276
Hey.

18:19.112 --> 18:20.179
Good boy.

18:24.250 --> 18:25.417
What are you doing?!

18:25.484 --> 18:27.585
You already filled
in the trench?

18:27.653 --> 18:29.987
Well, electrical
and water lines are sunk,

18:30.055 --> 18:32.389
So it kind of seems logical,
wouldn't you say?

18:32.457 --> 18:34.158
The unit is not hooked up yet.

18:34.226 --> 18:36.794
What if it doesn't work?

18:37.595 --> 18:38.930
I guess we're gonna have
to dig it back up?

18:38.997 --> 18:40.597
No.

18:40.665 --> 18:43.900
You will have
to dig it back up.

18:46.570 --> 18:49.739
Well, uh, everyday the
sun shines without fail.

18:49.807 --> 18:51.107
Mm-hmm.

18:51.175 --> 18:53.243
And at night everyone walks
along the waterfront

18:53.311 --> 18:55.712
And it's all lit up
and beautiful.

18:55.779 --> 18:57.613
It sounds like Dubai suits you.

18:57.681 --> 19:01.217
Yeah, yeah. You know,
there's a lot to do.

19:01.284 --> 19:02.952
I'm glad it's worked out
so well.

19:03.019 --> 19:04.253
Yeah.

19:04.321 --> 19:06.088
Well, what about you?

19:06.156 --> 19:07.089
How are things?

19:07.157 --> 19:08.790
Great.

19:08.859 --> 19:11.227
I'm managing a string
of polo ponies for Robert Worth.

19:11.294 --> 19:14.029
Really? The uh...
The rich guy?

19:14.097 --> 19:15.630
Everyone calls him
Robert Worth-A-Lot?

19:15.698 --> 19:17.598
Yeah, he's uh...

19:17.666 --> 19:19.800
He's pretty loaded
and he loves his polo,

19:19.869 --> 19:21.836
So he's got us the best ponies
in the country.

19:21.904 --> 19:23.304
Wow.

19:23.372 --> 19:24.906
We're going down to the World
Championships in Florida,

19:24.974 --> 19:27.541
So it's an amazing opportunity.

19:27.609 --> 19:28.776
Sounds like it.

19:28.844 --> 19:31.712
He even paid for
a top-notch american team

19:31.780 --> 19:32.880
To come up here

19:32.947 --> 19:34.882
For a private
exhibition match, so...

19:34.949 --> 19:36.583
Great.

19:36.650 --> 19:38.318
What else?

19:38.386 --> 19:41.188
Come on, I heard you married
Claire Watkins.

19:41.256 --> 19:44.224
Yeah, I did, but, uh, we split.

19:45.159 --> 19:46.760
It's been a few months now.

19:46.827 --> 19:49.195
Nick, I'm... I'm so sorry.
I had no idea.

19:49.263 --> 19:51.163
No, don't be.

19:52.099 --> 19:56.235
Sometimes these things
just don't work out.

20:03.343 --> 20:05.143
<i>Hey, Amy.</i>

20:05.211 --> 20:06.144
So, how'd it go?

20:06.212 --> 20:07.545
Not good.

20:07.613 --> 20:09.247
He just about threw me
during his exercise.

20:09.315 --> 20:11.349
That seems weird.
He's never done that before.

20:11.417 --> 20:13.451
<i>You okay?
Yeah, I'm fine.</i>

20:13.519 --> 20:14.786
But he's not, Nick.

20:14.853 --> 20:15.987
He seems fine now.

20:16.055 --> 20:18.189
Well, I gave him some thiamine.

20:18.257 --> 20:19.524
Okay, well,

20:19.591 --> 20:22.226
I'll add that into his
post-workout supplements.

20:22.294 --> 20:24.494
I just- I don't know
if that's a solution.

20:24.562 --> 20:25.796
I'd love to spend more time
with him, Nick.

20:25.863 --> 20:27.631
He just seems
really strung out.

20:27.698 --> 20:29.099
I just...

20:29.167 --> 20:31.936
I can't right now,
not with our schedule.

20:32.003 --> 20:33.837
Well, maybe you're workin' him
too hard.

20:33.905 --> 20:35.605
No, our horses are training
the same amount

20:35.673 --> 20:37.140
As all the other
top level teams.

20:37.207 --> 20:38.841
It's just, it's a lot
of pressure for a horse...

20:38.909 --> 20:40.977
<i>look, Amy,</i>

20:42.079 --> 20:44.213
I appreciate you
looking at him,

20:44.281 --> 20:46.316
But we're going
to the championships together

20:46.383 --> 20:48.284
And that's that.

20:49.386 --> 20:50.453
All right.

20:52.655 --> 20:53.655
Okay.

20:53.923 --> 20:56.091
I will try adding
in the thiamine

20:56.159 --> 20:57.659
To take the edge off.

20:57.726 --> 21:00.528
It's probably all he needs.

21:02.498 --> 21:03.631
Here goes.

21:03.699 --> 21:05.300
Fingers crossed.

21:07.270 --> 21:08.936
Yeah!

21:17.846 --> 21:19.546
Well, maybe there's a crack
in the water line.

21:19.614 --> 21:20.781
Not a chance.

21:20.849 --> 21:24.317
There'd still be some water
coming out.

21:26.220 --> 21:29.489
You connected the clamp
on that elbow to the riser?

21:29.556 --> 21:30.823
Yeah, uh, definitely.

21:30.891 --> 21:34.894
And you made sure
it was good and tight?

21:34.962 --> 21:37.097
How tight is tight?

21:39.033 --> 21:40.765
I'll get the shovel.

21:44.604 --> 21:45.604
All right, see you tomorrow.

21:45.671 --> 21:47.639
Okay.

21:47.707 --> 21:49.041
Hey, Janice.

21:49.109 --> 21:50.842
Hey, just came
to pick up my truck.

21:50.910 --> 21:51.843
Ah, long day.

21:51.911 --> 21:52.844
Yeah, I hear ya.

21:52.912 --> 21:54.179
Oh yeah?
What's going on?

21:54.247 --> 21:56.080
I'm working with this polo pony

21:56.148 --> 21:57.148
And I don't know.

21:57.216 --> 21:58.082
He used to be a perfect horse

21:58.150 --> 21:59.250
And now he's cribbin'

21:59.318 --> 22:00.618
And he won't go
in his stall and...

22:00.685 --> 22:02.153
He fights anyone who tries
to get him in there.

22:02.221 --> 22:03.921
<i>Yeah, and he just
about threw me today.</i>

22:03.989 --> 22:05.189
I don't know.
It must be...

22:05.257 --> 22:06.857
From his training or something.

22:06.925 --> 22:09.627
Listen, I know you probably want
to think that every problem

22:09.694 --> 22:11.595
Has to do with a horse's
delicate emotions.

22:11.663 --> 22:12.962
<i>Well, take it from a girl</i>

22:13.031 --> 22:14.431
<i>Who makes her living
at the track,</i>

22:14.499 --> 22:16.199
His problem's a hell of a lot
simpler than that.

22:16.267 --> 22:18.201
That horse is being doped.

22:20.971 --> 22:23.040
Well, that's just...

22:23.107 --> 22:24.574
So off the mark.

22:24.642 --> 22:28.044
No, I have to admit, Ty,
it's crossed my mind.

22:28.111 --> 22:29.478
What? Like steroids
or something?

22:29.546 --> 22:31.013
<i>Well, I don't know.</i>

22:31.081 --> 22:32.181
I just try not
to think about it,

22:32.249 --> 22:33.516
'cause I don't want to believe

22:33.583 --> 22:34.683
That Nick would do
something like that.

22:36.920 --> 22:39.855
Well, he seems pretty obsessed
with this tournament,

22:39.923 --> 22:41.257
And then there's the thing
with Dusty

22:41.324 --> 22:42.958
And all the other injuries.

22:43.026 --> 22:43.992
I'm going to the track tomorrow

22:44.060 --> 22:45.993
To look at another lame horse.

22:46.062 --> 22:47.228
It kind of makes you wonder.

22:47.296 --> 22:49.564
Hmm.
Maybe I'll tag along.

22:57.073 --> 22:59.874
You sure this is a babaganoush
kind of family?

22:59.942 --> 23:02.842
It's delicious, okay?
You'll see.

23:02.910 --> 23:05.512
I need you to steam the rice
for the kafta.

23:07.482 --> 23:08.915
It's meatballs.

23:08.983 --> 23:11.918
You sure this isn't
a bit too exotic?

23:11.986 --> 23:14.921
It's my meal
so it's my menu, okay?

23:14.989 --> 23:16.355
Can you please...

23:17.824 --> 23:19.225
Just steam the rice.

23:19.293 --> 23:21.727
Fine.
What's with you?

23:21.795 --> 23:23.262
It's just...

23:23.330 --> 23:24.497
Dad.

23:24.565 --> 23:26.999
Is this about him
dating that jockey?

23:27.067 --> 23:28.234
What?

23:28.302 --> 23:30.035
It's kind of obvious, isn't it?

23:30.104 --> 23:32.370
I mean, do you really think
she came all the way up here

23:32.438 --> 23:34.272
Because Tim's such a good boss?

23:34.340 --> 23:35.807
I don't think so.

23:35.874 --> 23:37.342
No way.

23:37.410 --> 23:39.911
I mean, dad has been
acting weird lately.

23:39.979 --> 23:42.981
But Janice?
I mean, she's...

23:43.048 --> 23:44.749
She totally reminds me
of somebody I know,

23:44.817 --> 23:47.552
But I can't put
my finger on who.

23:47.620 --> 23:49.086
No, there's no way
they're dating.

23:49.154 --> 23:50.321
<i>No way.</i>

23:50.388 --> 23:52.756
Okay, well, if not that
then what is it?

23:52.824 --> 23:54.525
It's just...

23:54.593 --> 23:55.993
The dude ranch.

23:56.060 --> 23:58.996
I mean, dad's not even
advertising it.

23:59.063 --> 24:00.331
Of course nobody's calling;

24:00.398 --> 24:01.999
They don't even know it exists!

24:02.066 --> 24:03.667
It's like...

24:03.735 --> 24:05.401
It just disappeared.

24:05.469 --> 24:07.270
Well, it kind of did,

24:07.338 --> 24:10.573
As in
when you just disappeared.

24:46.341 --> 24:48.476
Ty, check this out.

24:52.580 --> 24:54.681
<i>It's something you can do
when we get it on the horse.</i>

24:54.748 --> 24:56.316
<i>It'll be nice.</i>

24:56.384 --> 24:58.618
Are you using this
on your horses?

24:58.686 --> 24:59.752
Where'd you get that?

24:59.820 --> 25:01.353
The supplements room.

25:01.421 --> 25:02.988
Huh.

25:03.056 --> 25:04.723
It gives the horses some kick
during practice and games.

25:04.791 --> 25:06.024
It's a herb.

25:06.092 --> 25:09.127
No, it's not just a herb,
it's a stimulant.

25:09.196 --> 25:10.596
Ephedrasinica.

25:11.964 --> 25:13.131
I thought ephedrin was banned
from all sports.

25:13.200 --> 25:14.766
Hey, hey, hey, junior,
settle down, okay?

25:14.834 --> 25:16.234
We're not breaking
any rules here.

25:16.302 --> 25:17.602
<i>Actually, Mr. Worth,</i>

25:17.670 --> 25:19.170
They're gonna start doing
drug tests this year.

25:19.238 --> 25:22.073
Yeah, and they're still sorting
out what's on the banned list.

25:22.140 --> 25:24.309
Look, everyone knows there
won't be sanctions for years.

25:24.376 --> 25:26.511
That doesn't mean
it's right to use this.

25:26.579 --> 25:28.946
And with all these injuries
and with Dusty,

25:29.014 --> 25:30.481
I suggest you stop right away.

25:30.549 --> 25:32.449
Yeah, well, I suggest
you keep your help

25:32.517 --> 25:33.750
Out of our feed room

25:33.818 --> 25:35.819
Or we may need to look
for a new vet.

25:56.095 --> 25:57.195
<i>You can't just go
snooping around</i>

25:57.263 --> 25:58.496
In my client's stable.

25:58.565 --> 26:00.032
Scott, they're drugging
the horses.

26:00.099 --> 26:02.000
I don't agree with
what they're doing,

26:02.068 --> 26:03.969
But it's their horses.

26:04.037 --> 26:06.171
So we're gonna sit by
and do nothing about it?

26:06.238 --> 26:07.940
We'll monitor the horses
more carefully,

26:08.007 --> 26:10.474
But that's the best we can do
at this point.

26:10.542 --> 26:11.709
Seriously?

26:11.777 --> 26:14.211
What else do you want me to do?

26:14.279 --> 26:16.047
If I dropped every client
that didn't take my advice,

26:16.114 --> 26:18.583
I'd be out of business.

26:20.953 --> 26:24.388
Come on,
we've got a lot more calls.

26:25.322 --> 26:26.590
Actually, you know what?

26:26.657 --> 26:28.892
I'm gonna head back
to the ranch with Amy, so...

26:28.960 --> 26:30.326
Oh.

26:30.394 --> 26:33.229
Yeah, Jack needs help with
this horse watering thing.

26:35.666 --> 26:38.367
Well, I'll guess
I'll see you later then.

26:38.435 --> 26:40.503
Yeah, I'll see ya.

26:44.540 --> 26:46.508
You know, why didn't you tell me
about the ephedrin?

26:46.576 --> 26:50.079
Amy, look,
at this level of sport,

26:50.146 --> 26:51.080
You need to take
every advantage

26:51.147 --> 26:52.147
That you can get.

26:52.215 --> 26:54.182
Oh, come on.
No, seriously!

26:54.250 --> 26:55.918
If you're not boosting
your horse's performance,

26:55.986 --> 26:57.184
You might as well spot
the other team

26:57.252 --> 26:59.320
A couple of goals.

26:59.387 --> 27:02.356
That stuff just-
it can't be good for them.

27:02.424 --> 27:05.026
Rob used to own racehorses
and they used it all the time.

27:05.094 --> 27:07.095
There shouldn't be
any longterm side effects.

27:07.162 --> 27:08.596
You don't know that though.

27:08.664 --> 27:11.599
I mean, look at Dusty
and the other horses.

27:11.667 --> 27:15.401
Don't think that this
isn't weighing on me.

27:15.469 --> 27:18.038
I just don't see
the benefits, Nick.

27:18.106 --> 27:19.773
I keep decreasing the dose,

27:19.841 --> 27:22.109
But Worth is breathing
down my neck.

27:22.176 --> 27:23.376
He's convinced we need it.

27:23.444 --> 27:24.477
Do you really want to gamble

27:24.545 --> 27:26.013
With the health of your horses?

27:26.080 --> 27:28.348
This is my big shot,

27:28.415 --> 27:29.682
And you're asking me
to jeopardize

27:29.750 --> 27:33.085
Everything that
we've worked for.

27:35.388 --> 27:37.790
<i>See? It popped right off!</i>

27:38.725 --> 27:39.959
Well, I sure hope it works.

27:40.027 --> 27:42.194
I've got grand prarie rodeo
next week.

27:42.262 --> 27:44.530
Grand Prairie.
Yeah, I remember that one.

27:44.597 --> 27:48.232
Yeah? Did you see Tim take
all-around cowboy there?

27:48.300 --> 27:51.036
No, as it happens
I won it myself.

27:51.103 --> 27:52.771
No.

27:52.838 --> 27:54.605
Yes.

27:54.674 --> 27:55.606
Really?

27:55.675 --> 27:56.808
<i>Really.</i>

27:56.876 --> 27:58.109
Well, what was your best event?

27:58.177 --> 28:01.211
Oh, I always held my own
in the broncs, I guess.

28:01.279 --> 28:03.013
No kiddin', huh?

28:03.081 --> 28:04.514
That's pretty cool, Jack.

28:04.582 --> 28:06.349
Okay.

28:06.417 --> 28:07.885
<i>Turn it on.</i>

28:10.421 --> 28:11.388
<i>Yeah!</i>

28:11.455 --> 28:13.356
Oh yeah!
Look at that.

28:13.424 --> 28:15.025
Yup.
Yeah.

28:15.960 --> 28:17.794
There we go.
All right.

28:17.861 --> 28:20.429
Start backfillin' this trench.

28:22.966 --> 28:24.500
Need an extra pair of hands?

28:24.568 --> 28:26.836
I thought you were
working with Scott.

28:26.904 --> 28:28.104
Well, I was but, uh,

28:28.172 --> 28:30.239
I cut the day short
to help you guys out.

28:30.307 --> 28:33.875
Oh yeah.
What does that mean really?

28:35.812 --> 28:38.146
Scott and I had a difference
of opinion, that's all.

28:38.214 --> 28:39.514
Oh.

28:40.416 --> 28:41.717
I just think a vet
should always put the animals

28:41.784 --> 28:43.885
Before his business.

28:44.821 --> 28:46.421
Well, I don't know
what this is about,

28:46.488 --> 28:49.757
But I do know that
Scott's a damn good vet.

28:49.825 --> 28:51.291
Now, Marian gave him his start,

28:51.359 --> 28:54.261
So there is no question
he puts the animals first.

28:54.329 --> 28:55.996
You know, Ty...

28:58.033 --> 29:02.169
Not everything's always
so black and white.

29:06.673 --> 29:07.741
<i>Coming.</i>

29:14.581 --> 29:16.015
Hey stranger.

29:16.083 --> 29:17.984
Been a while.

29:18.052 --> 29:19.853
Yeah, it has.

29:19.920 --> 29:22.888
Like since before the wedding.

29:23.823 --> 29:26.792
Yeah, sorry I didn't make it.

29:26.860 --> 29:27.926
Animal emergency.

29:31.097 --> 29:32.497
So, um...

29:32.565 --> 29:34.466
How's life in Dubai?

29:35.401 --> 29:37.001
It's very good.

29:37.936 --> 29:39.003
Good.

29:40.405 --> 29:42.573
Are you here
for my welcome back dinner?

29:42.641 --> 29:44.242
No, I can't.

29:44.309 --> 29:46.410
I'm just here to see Ty.

29:46.478 --> 29:47.912
He wasn't in his loft.

29:47.980 --> 29:50.214
Oh, yeah,
I sent him on a grocery run.

29:50.282 --> 29:53.583
Well, just tell him
I stopped by.

29:54.752 --> 29:56.286
Okay.

29:56.353 --> 29:57.420
Bye.

30:00.158 --> 30:01.357
Okay...

30:02.393 --> 30:05.495
So there wasn't
an animal emergency.

30:06.430 --> 30:09.564
I should have been there
at your wedding.

30:09.632 --> 30:10.699
I'm sorry.

30:26.982 --> 30:28.917
Tell Peter I said hi.

30:28.984 --> 30:30.051
I will.

30:31.586 --> 30:33.788
Uh, is there, um...

30:33.856 --> 30:37.125
Is there anyone I should be
asking you to say hi to?

30:37.193 --> 30:38.259
Not yet.

30:46.534 --> 30:47.634
<i>Thank you.</i>

30:47.702 --> 30:49.369
<i>Lots of veggies.</i>

30:49.437 --> 30:51.071
Well, Janice,

30:51.139 --> 30:53.841
I'm hoping I can tempt you away
from your diet for one night.

30:53.908 --> 30:56.943
Ugh! I'm afraid it's just
chicken and rice for me tonight,

30:57.010 --> 30:58.410
But I made way too much

30:58.478 --> 31:00.179
So, if anyone wants to try any,
help yourself.

31:00.247 --> 31:01.647
Thank you,

31:01.715 --> 31:04.049
But I think they're gonna be
chowing down on my mesas.

31:04.116 --> 31:06.318
Wow, it looks great.

31:06.385 --> 31:09.654
<i>They're traditional
middle eastern appetizers.</i>

31:09.722 --> 31:10.788
<i>Dig in.</i>

31:14.526 --> 31:15.593
Mm-hmm.

31:16.963 --> 31:17.896
Minty.

31:17.964 --> 31:19.964
Mm-hmm.
This is tabouli.

31:20.031 --> 31:22.299
<i>It's the first time
I've tried making this one.</i>

31:25.837 --> 31:28.505
Looks like the chicken's a hit.

31:29.374 --> 31:32.042
So, Janice, do you
cook a lot back at home

31:32.110 --> 31:34.678
Like for a boyfriend
or something?

31:34.746 --> 31:36.645
Uh, yeah.
Yeah, I like to cook.

31:36.713 --> 31:38.748
But no boyfriend?

31:38.815 --> 31:40.083
No.

31:40.150 --> 31:42.085
Really?
A catch like you?

31:42.152 --> 31:44.487
<i>Okay, Mallory,
that's enough.</i>

31:44.554 --> 31:45.855
I'm sorry, Janice.

31:45.923 --> 31:48.992
<i>She has this crazy idea
in her head.</i>

31:49.059 --> 31:50.626
She thinks you two are dating.

31:50.694 --> 31:53.929
Actually,
she's very perceptive.

31:57.000 --> 31:58.066
What?

32:00.036 --> 32:01.569
Excuse me.

32:01.637 --> 32:02.704
What?

32:04.173 --> 32:06.241
I'm sorry.
I just... I um...

32:10.112 --> 32:11.178
Janice!

32:11.246 --> 32:12.846
Hey, hey, hey!
Hang on! Hang on!

32:12.915 --> 32:14.282
They were gonna
find out anyway.

32:14.349 --> 32:15.383
It's not my fault.

32:15.450 --> 32:16.583
Oh, yes it is!

32:16.651 --> 32:17.851
You just kept
forcing me on them

32:17.920 --> 32:19.053
Until they figured it out!

32:19.121 --> 32:20.421
Well, I'm sorry I want
to tell everybody

32:20.488 --> 32:21.755
What a great woman you are.

32:21.823 --> 32:24.090
Sometimes I really,
really hate you!

32:24.158 --> 32:25.225
Just stop it.

32:27.428 --> 32:28.895
Stop, stop...

32:37.638 --> 32:39.906
I don't get
what he sees in her.

32:39.973 --> 32:43.175
She's arrogant;
She's ultra-competitive;

32:43.243 --> 32:44.977
And she thinks she knows
everything about everything!

32:45.045 --> 32:46.979
It's like she always
has to one-up you and...

32:47.047 --> 32:48.447
Oh my god, she's dad!

32:49.816 --> 32:52.651
No, that's who
she reminds me of!

32:53.586 --> 32:55.654
Well, this is starting
to make some sense.

32:55.721 --> 32:56.787
Mm-hmm.

32:57.957 --> 32:59.190
Oh jeez.

32:59.258 --> 33:00.891
You gotta admit
they look happy.

33:10.202 --> 33:11.269
Come on, Hudson!

33:17.875 --> 33:19.242
Come on! Come on!
Get 'em up!

33:25.416 --> 33:27.951
Oh, come on! Come on!

33:30.454 --> 33:32.154
Man, they're really
gonna hand it to 'em.

33:32.222 --> 33:33.789
What's that, like 4 to 1 now?

33:38.061 --> 33:40.429
Thank god
for half-time.

33:40.497 --> 33:42.965
At least Dusty seems
under control out there.

33:43.033 --> 33:45.133
Yeah, but he's been slow
to the play.

33:45.201 --> 33:46.968
All the Hudson horses have.

33:47.036 --> 33:50.838
What the hell's wrong
with these horses?

33:50.906 --> 33:52.140
Did you decrease
their dose again?

33:52.208 --> 33:53.441
I don't think
it was really working.

33:53.509 --> 33:54.642
Are you nuts?!

33:54.710 --> 33:56.378
These horses were fine
during practice.

33:56.445 --> 33:57.712
There were adverse
side effects.

33:57.779 --> 33:59.414
So what?
You just cut them off

33:59.482 --> 34:00.847
Without telling me?

34:00.915 --> 34:01.882
Isn't that the sort of decision

34:01.949 --> 34:03.117
We should be making together?

34:03.184 --> 34:04.951
Oh, come on, rob,
we'll get back in this.

34:05.020 --> 34:06.153
Yeah, you're damn right
we will.

34:06.221 --> 34:09.556
Get those horses
their jump back.

34:21.766 --> 34:23.500
Come on! Let's go!

34:23.567 --> 34:26.036
Woo!

34:30.007 --> 34:31.306
Let's go, Hudson!
Tie it up!

34:38.447 --> 34:39.849
Yeah!

34:39.917 --> 34:41.217
Nick, yeah!

34:41.284 --> 34:42.217
Yeah! Woo!

34:46.056 --> 34:47.989
Dusty, whoa!

34:48.056 --> 34:48.924
Oh no.

34:48.991 --> 34:50.525
Whoa, Dusty!

34:50.592 --> 34:51.525
Dusty?

34:52.862 --> 34:53.829
Nick!

34:56.165 --> 34:57.732
Nick!

34:58.968 --> 35:00.035
Let's go!

35:01.804 --> 35:03.603
Easy!

35:03.671 --> 35:04.872
Whoa!

35:18.953 --> 35:20.419
Agh!

35:20.487 --> 35:22.455
Dusty?!

35:22.522 --> 35:24.324
Look out!

35:25.559 --> 35:26.860
<i>Easy, boy.</i>

35:26.927 --> 35:28.261
<i>Ty!</i>

35:28.329 --> 35:30.296
Take your jacket off!
Put it over his head!

35:31.631 --> 35:32.698
Easy, easy.

35:36.936 --> 35:38.003
Okay.

35:40.840 --> 35:41.907
Is he okay?

35:45.111 --> 35:46.111
Okay, we only get
a short break.

35:46.179 --> 35:48.480
Let's get another horse ready.

35:48.547 --> 35:49.614
Have they all had it?

35:49.682 --> 35:50.749
The ephedrin?

35:52.450 --> 35:53.684
Call the match.

35:53.752 --> 35:54.886
I want to examine
the rest of the horses.

35:54.953 --> 35:57.255
Hey, hey, the horses are fine!

35:57.322 --> 35:59.257
Just do your job.
You just take care of Dusty.

36:01.593 --> 36:04.428
<i>No, Robert, he's right.</i>

36:04.496 --> 36:05.897
The game's over.

36:20.577 --> 36:21.811
I don't know what happened.

36:21.879 --> 36:23.745
What is going on here?!

36:23.813 --> 36:26.782
The float probably got stuck.
It's been running all morning.

36:26.849 --> 36:29.551
The platform sunk,
busted the water line.

36:29.619 --> 36:30.685
Don't tell me.

36:32.122 --> 36:33.855
What? What are you gonna do?

36:33.924 --> 36:34.890
We're diggin' it up.

36:34.958 --> 36:35.991
Yeah.

36:36.059 --> 36:38.060
For the third time.

36:38.128 --> 36:39.460
Yeah, well, it'll
be the last time too.

36:39.528 --> 36:41.529
This piece of junk
is comin' out.

36:41.596 --> 36:43.231
Grampa.

36:43.299 --> 36:46.000
Does it look to you like this
is saving me any work at all?

36:47.869 --> 36:48.937
Fine.

36:52.041 --> 36:53.341
Go turn it off, Caleb.

36:58.879 --> 37:00.113
<i>Amy, what are you doing?</i>

37:00.181 --> 37:01.614
You can't use steel wool
in that pan.

37:01.682 --> 37:03.683
You'll ruin the coating.

37:03.751 --> 37:04.818
Here, you dry.

37:12.059 --> 37:14.860
I can't believe you're going
back in a couple of days.

37:14.928 --> 37:16.929
It almost seems like you miss
your big sister.

37:16.997 --> 37:18.497
Well, yeah,

37:18.565 --> 37:19.665
There's been no one
to tell me how to wash dishes.

37:19.732 --> 37:20.666
That's right.

37:49.395 --> 37:50.461
Hey.

37:52.797 --> 37:56.300
I just want to let you know
that Dusty's doing better.

37:56.368 --> 37:57.434
That's good.

37:58.370 --> 38:00.237
Look...

38:00.305 --> 38:01.872
I know that I screwed up

38:01.939 --> 38:06.976
And you probably don't even
want to look at me right now,

38:07.911 --> 38:10.079
But I'm hoping that
you'll come by

38:10.147 --> 38:12.615
To check on Dusty...

38:12.682 --> 38:13.883
For his sake.

38:14.818 --> 38:15.885
Okay.

38:16.820 --> 38:17.887
Thank you.

38:21.291 --> 38:22.357
Hey.

38:28.398 --> 38:30.132
Amy told me what happened.

38:31.067 --> 38:32.834
Are you gonna be okay?

38:32.902 --> 38:34.936
I don't know.

38:35.004 --> 38:38.105
Maybe this was the wake-up call
that I needed.

38:38.173 --> 38:42.543
My priorities
have been out of whack.

38:42.610 --> 38:44.512
I let this sport
ruin my marriage.

38:44.579 --> 38:45.712
Nick, don't go there.

38:45.780 --> 38:47.515
No, it's true.

38:49.284 --> 38:50.617
Claire was fine
with the polo career

38:50.685 --> 38:52.053
When I started,

38:52.120 --> 38:55.021
But the more that I dragged her
around the circuit...

38:55.089 --> 38:57.023
The more she felt like
she was giving up her life

38:57.091 --> 38:58.724
For your dreams?

38:59.660 --> 39:00.726
Yeah.

39:01.929 --> 39:03.896
Something like that.

39:04.831 --> 39:08.801
It's tough for a guy
to change though, right?

39:08.869 --> 39:10.936
I gotta try.

39:11.003 --> 39:13.004
I want Claire back.

39:13.940 --> 39:14.873
I want the two of us
to be happy

39:14.941 --> 39:17.076
Like you and Peter.

39:19.679 --> 39:22.081
Have a safe trip home.

39:53.145 --> 39:54.212
Lou?

39:55.046 --> 39:56.514
What's wrong?

39:59.117 --> 40:01.352
My life.

40:03.888 --> 40:06.490
Is everything okay with Peter?

40:07.426 --> 40:08.859
Yes.

40:08.927 --> 40:09.993
Honestly.

40:11.829 --> 40:13.730
We couldn't be better,

40:14.665 --> 40:17.133
Except that we live in Dubai.

40:18.402 --> 40:19.636
Lou, I thought you loved it.

40:19.704 --> 40:21.204
No, I hate it!

40:22.105 --> 40:25.975
All I do is go out on these,
these frivolous outings

40:26.043 --> 40:27.275
With a bunch of women

40:27.344 --> 40:29.878
That I have nothing
in common with.

40:32.215 --> 40:34.249
Mallory was right.

40:34.317 --> 40:36.885
It's like I'm on this
permanent vacation

40:36.953 --> 40:39.621
From my life.

40:43.925 --> 40:45.760
Have you told Peter all this?

40:45.828 --> 40:48.696
I've been lonely,

40:48.764 --> 40:51.098
But I didn't even know
how lonely

40:51.166 --> 40:53.067
Until I came home.

40:55.237 --> 40:56.604
It's like everywhere I look

40:56.672 --> 40:59.239
There's a reminder
of something I've given up

40:59.306 --> 41:02.442
To follow him off
to Dubai and...

41:03.644 --> 41:06.380
I feel like I've given up
a big piece of who I am...

41:08.750 --> 41:10.884
And I want it back.

41:13.287 --> 41:15.120
What are you gonna do?

41:15.188 --> 41:16.856
I don't know.

41:18.392 --> 41:20.860
I don't know.

41:23.062 --> 41:24.129
Come here.

41:28.234 --> 41:29.167
Ungh!

41:29.235 --> 41:31.770
♪ come away, come away ♪

41:31.837 --> 41:34.338
♪ to the lighting of the day ♪

41:35.274 --> 41:39.644
♪ all the truth will be saved

41:41.881 --> 41:45.583
♪ and the secrets unseen
when the lighthouse... ♪

41:46.518 --> 41:48.385
I'll catch up with you inside.

41:48.453 --> 41:52.823
♪ and the ships that still sail
when you do ♪

41:55.326 --> 41:59.029
Look, I'm sorry I bailed on you
the other day.

41:59.096 --> 42:01.932
I know being a vet can
get complicated sometimes,

42:01.999 --> 42:03.466
But I need you
to explain to me...

42:03.534 --> 42:06.135
Ty, you were right.

42:06.202 --> 42:10.039
I should have pushed them
harder to make them stop,

42:10.106 --> 42:11.507
And you sounded
exactly like I did

42:11.575 --> 42:15.645
When I was in vet school.

42:15.712 --> 42:19.180
So are you back on the job
or what?

42:20.316 --> 42:22.317
Absolutely, boss.

42:25.755 --> 42:26.822
All right.

42:31.494 --> 42:32.694
Hey.

42:32.762 --> 42:33.829
Hey.

42:36.431 --> 42:37.498
What?

42:39.233 --> 42:42.503
I got you a little
"Welcome to Alberta" gift.

42:42.571 --> 42:43.737
And I know it's not California,

42:43.805 --> 42:47.341
But it's a pretty
special place.

42:47.408 --> 42:48.509
And I just wanted to thank you

42:48.577 --> 42:51.978
For following this
old cowboy up here.

42:53.180 --> 42:55.047
So...

42:55.115 --> 42:56.248
Thanks.

42:56.984 --> 42:58.150
Come here, you.

42:58.218 --> 42:59.285
Come here.

43:03.691 --> 43:06.392
Hey, guys.

43:06.460 --> 43:07.926
Hey.

43:08.995 --> 43:11.697
<i>Uh, I was just gonna take Dex
for a run, so...</i>

43:11.764 --> 43:12.865
- Okay.
- Yeah, I'll see ya.

43:12.932 --> 43:15.000
<i>- See ya.
- Bye.</i>

43:16.636 --> 43:19.471
Um, we need to talk
about the dude ranch.

43:19.539 --> 43:20.706
Okay.

43:20.773 --> 43:23.374
You come up with
a succession plan?

43:23.441 --> 43:25.209
No...

43:25.276 --> 43:28.112
I'm not going anywhere,
not yet.

43:28.179 --> 43:29.179
No?

43:29.247 --> 43:30.715
No, I just, I want to...

43:30.782 --> 43:32.617
Think through what's best
for the dude ranch

43:32.684 --> 43:34.986
And, you know, figure out
how this is gonna work.

43:35.053 --> 43:36.453
Are you sure though
that this is the right place

43:36.522 --> 43:38.055
For you to be?

43:38.123 --> 43:39.523
Yes.

43:39.590 --> 43:41.591
Yeah, I'm sure.

43:41.659 --> 43:43.126
Well, I'm happy.

43:43.193 --> 43:45.027
Good.

43:45.962 --> 43:47.029
Me too.

43:52.602 --> 43:53.669
You know, it's awesome
that Scott's giving you

43:53.737 --> 43:55.638
All this hands-on
experience.

43:57.473 --> 43:59.241
I just... You know,

43:59.308 --> 44:00.542
I kind of miss working together

44:00.609 --> 44:01.743
Out at the ranch.

44:01.810 --> 44:02.944
Me too.

44:04.580 --> 44:05.847
But, you know,
the way I see it,

44:05.915 --> 44:09.250
If I work hard now,
become a vet,

44:09.317 --> 44:12.086
