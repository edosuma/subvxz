(MARQUESS HUMMING)

00:33.768 --> 00:35.300
MIKE: What the... (BLEEP)

00:36.369 --> 00:39.071
Michael! What on earth
are you doing?

00:39.073 --> 00:41.040
There's no pigeons
in the pigeon coop.

00:41.042 --> 00:44.109
Not one!
Not one (BLEEP) pigeon.

00:45.412 --> 00:48.180
Ugh, good riddance, right?
(CHUCKLES)

00:48.182 --> 00:51.950
I'm sorry. I mean,
I'm sorry, but pigeons
are disgusting.

00:51.952 --> 00:54.953
They're dirty, they're vile,
they're disease ridden.

00:54.955 --> 00:58.390
Oh, and they're ugly...
(GASPS)

00:58.392 --> 01:00.025
How long have you been
standing there?

01:00.027 --> 01:02.461
Did you hear what I said?
Because you heard it wrong.

01:02.463 --> 01:03.929
Yeah.
It's, it's not what you think.

01:03.931 --> 01:05.631
I was, um... (LAUGHS)

01:05.633 --> 01:08.333
Ah, I was joking!
It was a joke.

01:08.335 --> 01:10.969
I knew you were there,
that's why I said it. (LAUGHS)

01:10.971 --> 01:12.371
To be funny.

01:13.873 --> 01:16.141
Okay, I didn't know
you were there. I just...

01:16.143 --> 01:17.676
(EXHALES) I wanted, um...

01:17.678 --> 01:19.111
The reason
I said those things,

01:19.113 --> 01:21.280
those terrible things,

01:21.282 --> 01:25.551
was I just, um,
wanted to hear 'em, yeah.

01:25.553 --> 01:27.052
I wanted to hear
what they sound like

01:27.054 --> 01:28.420
coming out of my mouth,

01:28.422 --> 01:32.024
um, so that later...(SCOFFS)

01:32.026 --> 01:35.994
Okay, okay, okay. That doesn't
make any sense. Um...

01:35.996 --> 01:40.032
Okay, look, don't go making
this into something it's not.

01:40.034 --> 01:41.733
I didn't mean you.
I meant them.

01:41.735 --> 01:43.836
Not them, I don't mean them.
I'm not...

01:43.838 --> 01:45.237
-(DOOR OPENS)
-Making about...

01:45.239 --> 01:48.674
They're gone. The pigeons.
They're all gone.

01:48.676 --> 01:51.243
Yeah, I don't get
why you ever had them
in the first place.

01:51.245 --> 01:53.345
-They're disgusting.
-(GASPS)

01:53.347 --> 01:55.314
-Asshole.
-What could it mean?

01:55.316 --> 01:57.316
No one is sending messages
asking for help

01:57.318 --> 01:58.984
by carrier
pigeons anymore?

01:58.986 --> 02:01.320
It's kind of surprising that
anyone was sending messages

02:01.322 --> 02:03.055
by carrier pigeon ever.

02:03.057 --> 02:04.356
Hey, wait a minute.

02:04.358 --> 02:06.058
Maybe no one's
sending messages

02:06.060 --> 02:07.626
asking us to solve
their mysteries

02:07.628 --> 02:10.829
because there's no more
mysteries to be solved.

02:10.831 --> 02:12.331
We solved them all.

02:12.333 --> 02:14.867
Guys, our work is done.

02:14.869 --> 02:16.468
Turn in your tracksuits.

02:16.470 --> 02:21.673
The Mike Tyson mystery team
is official disband.

02:21.675 --> 02:24.276
-I never got a tracksuit.
-Me either.

02:24.278 --> 02:26.812
Yung, it's time for you to
follow your own dreams

02:26.814 --> 02:28.614
and go to college.

02:28.616 --> 02:31.150
Dad, I'm already enrolled.
I've been taking classes
at night.

02:31.152 --> 02:32.885
(BLEEPS) A.
Get that knowledge, girl.

02:32.887 --> 02:33.986
Get that knowledge.

02:33.988 --> 02:36.355
That's where you go, class?

02:36.357 --> 02:37.689
You know, I always thought

02:37.691 --> 02:39.892
you were one of those
good girls by day,

02:39.894 --> 02:42.060
bad girls by night types.

02:42.062 --> 02:43.695
You know,
like that movie <i> Angel.</i>

02:43.697 --> 02:46.098
-What?
-You never saw <i> Angel?</i>

02:46.100 --> 02:48.867
Come on, there were like
three of 'em.

02:48.869 --> 02:51.503
Early days of cable,
they showed it all the time.

02:51.505 --> 02:53.605
You'd keep watching
hoping to catch

02:53.607 --> 02:56.742
a little tit action
and you couldn't rewind.

02:56.744 --> 02:59.144
Yeah, they didn't have
rewind back then

02:59.146 --> 03:01.213
so you had to watch
the (BLEEP) thing again.

03:01.215 --> 03:03.215
(CHUCKLES) Yeah.

03:03.217 --> 03:05.951
Nothin'?
You never saw <i> Angel?</i>

03:06.486 --> 03:07.486
(BLEEP)

03:07.488 --> 03:09.288
When the (BLEEP)
were you born?

03:09.290 --> 03:12.324
-1998.
-Oh, my God, 1998.

03:12.326 --> 03:14.159
I am so much older than you.

03:14.161 --> 03:17.763
As a token of my gratitude
for all of your hard work

03:17.765 --> 03:20.132
as a Mike Tyson
Mystery Team member,

03:20.134 --> 03:22.734
please enjoy
this margarita machine.

03:22.736 --> 03:23.735
Oh, okay.

03:23.737 --> 03:25.337
Marquess, you came from
beyond the grave

03:25.339 --> 03:26.805
to save me from myself,

03:26.807 --> 03:30.008
and to give back to others
by solving mysteries.

03:30.010 --> 03:31.176
I have done that.

03:31.178 --> 03:33.111
I never said solve mysteries.

03:33.113 --> 03:36.281
Now you should go and save
another heavyweight champion
from himself.

03:36.283 --> 03:38.250
-Michael, I think...
-I suggest Larry Holmes.

03:38.252 --> 03:39.551
-Michael...
-Please, Marquess.

03:39.553 --> 03:42.020
Sometimes I worry about
Larry Holmes.

03:42.022 --> 03:43.555
Oh, my God.

03:43.557 --> 03:45.924
Ah, take the
margarita machine, Marquess.

03:46.259 --> 03:47.659
Ugh.

03:47.661 --> 03:48.794
YUNG: Hmm.

03:48.796 --> 03:51.630
Why do you have so many
margarita machines?

03:51.632 --> 03:55.834
Well, when you're a celebrity,
people just send (BLEEP)
over to you, you know.

03:55.836 --> 03:57.569
I got tons of 'em. Here.

03:57.571 --> 03:59.938
Well, thank you for this
incredibly personal

03:59.940 --> 04:01.173
and thoughtful gift, Mike.

04:01.175 --> 04:03.041
Dad, where're you going?

04:03.043 --> 04:04.443
I don't know.

04:08.781 --> 04:10.048
Damn.

04:10.050 --> 04:11.683
What am I going to do now?

04:12.986 --> 04:16.188
Maybe I should just
lay down and die.

04:16.190 --> 04:18.023
I've done all I could do
in this life.

04:18.025 --> 04:19.558
(HORN BLARES)

04:20.226 --> 04:21.627
It's my time.

04:25.031 --> 04:27.532
The light. Go to the light.

04:35.575 --> 04:37.843
Hey, wait a second.
That's pigeon shit.

04:40.213 --> 04:41.480
Where're you going,
little guy?

04:41.482 --> 04:42.981
My house is that way!

04:51.824 --> 04:53.058
Snoop Dogg?

04:54.494 --> 04:55.927
What up, Mike?

04:55.929 --> 04:57.896
I didn't know you had
a house here, brother.

04:57.898 --> 05:01.400
(BLEEP) Yeah, I got
a big (BLEEP) house
in St. Louis, too.

05:01.402 --> 05:03.302
Let me show you my succulents.

05:03.304 --> 05:04.903
Oh, no, no, thank you.
I'm into women.

05:04.905 --> 05:07.239
I'm talkin' about
desert fauna, fool.

05:07.241 --> 05:10.876
I got five kinds of aloes,
two types of burrow tails

05:10.878 --> 05:13.078
and a (BLEEP) load
of blue agave to play off

05:13.080 --> 05:15.213
the Moroccan blue of the pots.

05:15.215 --> 05:18.116
Hey, Mike, would you mind
turnin' off the water?

05:18.118 --> 05:19.818
Sure thing, brother.

05:19.820 --> 05:21.586
See, many people think
you don't got to
water this shit.

05:21.588 --> 05:23.989
But you do. See, that's the
(BLEEP) misconception.

05:23.991 --> 05:26.792
Yeah, I thought you didn't
have to water that (BLEEP)
at all, my man.

05:26.794 --> 05:28.994
For real? Well, now you know.

05:28.996 --> 05:30.295
Now, I know.

05:30.297 --> 05:31.730
So, what's going on?

05:31.732 --> 05:33.598
Man, I think I saw a pigeon
fly to your house.

05:33.600 --> 05:35.534
But I bet it was trying to
fly to my house.

05:35.536 --> 05:36.768
I bet it got lost.

05:36.770 --> 05:38.537
No, I don't think he got lost.

05:44.143 --> 05:45.677
That's a pigeon coop?

05:45.679 --> 05:48.280
SNOOP DOGG: As envisioned
by architect Frank Gehry.

05:48.282 --> 05:49.681
Pigeons love it.

05:49.683 --> 05:51.116
But they sometimes
have trouble

05:51.118 --> 05:52.517
with those Gehry curves.

05:52.519 --> 05:54.720
I didn't even know you was
into pigeons, man.

05:54.722 --> 05:56.722
-(BLEEP)
-Oh, yeah.

05:56.724 --> 05:59.057
They bring me messages
from people in need.

05:59.059 --> 06:01.827
And helping them, you know,
it makes me feel good
about myself.

06:01.829 --> 06:03.562
And it fills my life
with meaning.

06:03.564 --> 06:05.664
-Hey, but that's mine.
-But I don't just do it alone.

06:05.666 --> 06:07.299
I got a whole team.

06:07.301 --> 06:08.867
A child prodigy scientist,

06:08.869 --> 06:10.369
-a mountain lion...
-(PURRS)

06:10.371 --> 06:12.237
...and my main man
Ross Matthews.

06:12.239 --> 06:13.638
-Good to see you.
-Oh.

06:13.640 --> 06:15.607
And we got a Russian military
helicopter

06:15.609 --> 06:17.442
that takes us
where we want to go.

06:17.444 --> 06:19.378
Aren't those expensive, man?

06:19.380 --> 06:21.580
If you think 12 million
is expensive.

06:21.582 --> 06:23.548
Yeah, I think it is.

06:24.517 --> 06:26.485
(MUSIC PLAYING)

06:26.487 --> 06:30.555
I'm also in the process of
making an animated show
about my adventures

06:30.557 --> 06:33.525
called <i> Snoop Dogg's</i>
<i>Unsolved Situations.</i>

06:33.527 --> 06:35.727
You're gonna have a cartoon
made out of you.

06:35.729 --> 06:37.996
I always wanted to have
a cartoon out of me.

06:37.998 --> 06:40.999
Personally, I don't care
for cartoons.

06:41.001 --> 06:42.801
But I let my
business manager...

06:42.803 --> 06:45.637
Deezy, he handles
all of that kind of (BLEEP)

06:46.205 --> 06:47.339
(BLEEP) Deezy.

06:47.341 --> 06:49.508
<i>Hey, help, I'm in peril.</i>

06:50.576 --> 06:53.545
<i>Snoopy, help, I'm in peril.</i>

06:53.547 --> 06:55.747
Oh, Snoop, I don't know
how I'm gonna say this,

06:55.749 --> 06:57.149
but, man, solving mysteries

06:57.151 --> 06:59.684
is kinda like, um,
you know, my thing.

06:59.686 --> 07:02.354
That's cool.
I hear you, but...

07:02.356 --> 07:04.389
I solve unsolved situations.

07:04.391 --> 07:05.791
So that's totally different.

07:07.093 --> 07:09.027
Mike, we're cool, right?

07:09.029 --> 07:13.265
Yeah, uh, unsolved situations
is different than mysteries.

07:13.267 --> 07:14.966
Yeah, uh, we're cool.

07:14.968 --> 07:17.169
-We're cool, yeah, we're cool.
-Yoo-hoo, Snoopy!

07:17.171 --> 07:19.938
-(HELICOPTER BLADES WHIR)
-We have a new
unsolved situation.

07:25.845 --> 07:27.179
(CRYING)

07:34.487 --> 07:35.720
Why'd you tell him
you're cool?

07:35.722 --> 07:37.656
You're not cool.
You're crying.

07:37.658 --> 07:39.524
(SOBBING) I'm not crying.

07:39.526 --> 07:44.095
(STUTTERING)
My eyes are just sweatin'
a little bit, that's all.

07:44.097 --> 07:45.530
(CONTINUES CRYING)

07:50.069 --> 07:54.172
"I need your help.
Sincerizzle." Snoop Dogg?

07:54.174 --> 07:56.408
Whoa, you know
what this means?

07:56.410 --> 07:59.511
That "sincerely,"
not the best word

07:59.513 --> 08:01.079
to add "izzle" to.

08:01.081 --> 08:03.815
No, it means that we gotta get
the team back together.

08:03.817 --> 08:05.684
I don't think it
has to mean that.

08:05.686 --> 08:09.020
The sphere of influence
of the Han empire

08:09.022 --> 08:10.956
opened up the Silk Road

08:10.958 --> 08:13.658
-that connected China to...
-Yung!

08:13.660 --> 08:16.294
Where Yung Hee at?

08:16.296 --> 08:17.896
-Dad?
-Come on, Yung.

08:17.898 --> 08:19.664
We got us a mystery to solve.

08:19.666 --> 08:20.799
Dad, I'm kind of
in the middle of...

08:20.801 --> 08:22.367
You're Yung Hee Tyson?

08:22.369 --> 08:23.935
Oh, how come
you never say that?

08:23.937 --> 08:26.104
You are famous.
Get out of here.

08:26.106 --> 08:28.707
Go with your dad.
Go solve your mystery.

08:28.709 --> 08:31.243
Asian Studies.
(BLEEP) Damn, Yung.

08:31.245 --> 08:34.012
You are Asian.
You don't need to study it.

08:34.014 --> 08:35.747
1999?

08:35.749 --> 08:37.949
(CHUCKLES) You were
born in 1999?

08:37.951 --> 08:40.852
(BLEEP) I'm so (BLEEP) old.

08:42.622 --> 08:44.789
I'm sorry, I'm very confused.

08:44.791 --> 08:47.492
He sent you to come here
and live with me

08:47.494 --> 08:50.328
because he's worried about me?

08:50.330 --> 08:52.864
And you say you are a ghost?

08:52.866 --> 08:55.867
Um, yes. I mean, basically.

08:55.869 --> 08:57.736
What do you mean "basically"?

08:57.738 --> 08:59.271
What am I leavin' out?

08:59.273 --> 09:01.072
(SIGHS) Nothing.

09:01.074 --> 09:03.141
-Well, you tell Mike Tyson...
-(VEHICLE APPROACHING)

09:03.143 --> 09:05.143
...Larry Holmes
is doing just fine.

09:05.145 --> 09:07.312
And I think you should go
live with him,

09:07.314 --> 09:09.748
-because I'm worried
about him.
-(HONKS)

09:10.716 --> 09:12.751
Hey, Larry,
I need Marquess back!

09:12.753 --> 09:15.820
I know you probably
need him to save you
from all of your problems,

09:15.822 --> 09:17.789
but I need him more.

09:18.558 --> 09:19.891
Well, I should
probably just...

09:19.893 --> 09:21.459
Get the (BLEEP) out of here.

09:21.461 --> 09:22.827
Uh-huh.

09:26.198 --> 09:27.265
Thanks for comin', Mike.

09:27.267 --> 09:30.035
I got a big old (BLEEP)
mystery on my hands.

09:30.037 --> 09:32.370
Is it who ripped up
all your succulents?

09:32.372 --> 09:33.638
'Cause that was me.

09:33.640 --> 09:35.473
I did it after I left
your house.

09:35.475 --> 09:36.775
You said was I cool?

09:36.777 --> 09:38.109
And I should have
told you the truth.

09:38.111 --> 09:40.011
I was not cool.

09:40.013 --> 09:42.847
But now I'm cool again
'cause I'm back doin' what
I was put on this Earth to do.

09:42.849 --> 09:44.516
So what's the big
(BLEEP) mystery?

09:44.518 --> 09:45.884
I can't find Chin.

09:45.886 --> 09:47.719
Who the (BLEEP) is Chin?

09:47.721 --> 09:49.921
My little
child prodigy scientist.

09:49.923 --> 09:52.123
Where was the last place
you saw him?

09:52.125 --> 09:54.159
He was chillin'
with the mountain lion.

09:54.161 --> 09:58.263
Hmm. Well, then, let's go see
that mountain lion.

09:58.265 --> 10:00.231
Shit, you're good at this.

10:02.268 --> 10:03.702
This is his room.

10:03.704 --> 10:06.571
Yo, mountain lion. It's Snoop.

10:06.573 --> 10:08.406
I'm comin' in.

10:08.408 --> 10:10.475
(ALL EXCLAIM)

10:10.477 --> 10:12.510
You guys, what is going on?

10:12.512 --> 10:15.313
-Mountain lion ate Chin.
-Ah!

10:15.315 --> 10:16.548
-(GUNSHOT FIRED)
-(ALL EXCLAIM)

10:16.550 --> 10:18.216
(THUDS)

10:18.218 --> 10:19.918
Shame, noble creature.

10:19.920 --> 10:23.688
But once they get a taste
for human flesh, you gotta
put 'em down.

10:23.690 --> 10:26.124
Okay, I'm sorry,
this is crazy!

10:26.126 --> 10:29.227
-Lose my number, bitches!
-(DOOR CLOSES)

10:29.229 --> 10:31.830
Well, it looks like
I've lost my team.

10:31.832 --> 10:35.700
Mike, are you cool if I start
sending unsolved situations
your way from now on?

10:35.702 --> 10:37.202
Yeah, I'm cool with that.

10:37.204 --> 10:39.971
For real, though? 'Cause last
time you said that,

10:39.973 --> 10:42.841
-you were not cool.
-Yeah, for real.

10:42.843 --> 10:45.276
You also cool with contacting
Chin's parents?

10:54.854 --> 10:56.087
Man, you had a mountain lion?

10:56.089 --> 10:57.789
I had a mountain lion.
Sierra, yes.
