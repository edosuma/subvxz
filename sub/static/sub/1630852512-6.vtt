00:20.187 --> 00:22.388
hey, everyone
<i> and welcome to battlebots,</i>

00:22.390 --> 00:24.590
the sport that puts
the robot in,

00:24.592 --> 00:27.726
"hey, look at that robot
beat the crap out
of that other robot."

00:27.728 --> 00:30.029
I'm chris rose,
and I'm joined, as always,

00:30.031 --> 00:32.131
by ufc legend
and our fight analyst,

00:32.133 --> 00:34.500
say hello to kenny florian.

00:34.502 --> 00:37.403
[audience cheering]

00:39.373 --> 00:42.041
thanks, chris, we're in
the thick of the qualifiers
and I got to tell you,

00:42.043 --> 00:45.644
I am pumped
after last week's battles,
I got so hyped up,

00:45.646 --> 00:47.212
I ran out to my local best buy

00:47.214 --> 00:50.149
and challenged
a vacuum cleaner
to a fistfight.

00:50.151 --> 00:52.151
So how'd that go?

00:53.220 --> 00:54.853
I lost by decision.

00:54.855 --> 00:58.957
I'm guessing you mean
their decision to have you
removed by security.

00:58.959 --> 01:00.826
Suck master 5000.

01:00.828 --> 01:02.194
Don't get cocky,

01:02.196 --> 01:06.732
I own a lot of disguises
and I will be back
to finish what I started.

01:06.734 --> 01:09.101
[audience cheering]

01:10.805 --> 01:12.438
[chris] okay,
speaking of disguises,

01:12.440 --> 01:14.473
as we get further
into the qualifying rounds,

01:14.475 --> 01:17.810
we're starting to get an idea
of which bots are sheep
in wolves clothing

01:17.812 --> 01:21.914
and which might
actually have what it takes
to go the distance.

01:21.916 --> 01:25.984
<i>  And in a season</i>
<i> where each team gets a maximum</i>
<i>  of just three fights</i>

01:25.986 --> 01:27.319
<i>  to impress</i>
<i>  the selection committee,</i>

01:27.321 --> 01:30.389
<i>  you cannot take a day off.</i>

01:30.391 --> 01:34.193
<i>  And tonight's fight card</i>
<i>  features a handful</i>
<i>  of elite teams</i>

01:34.195 --> 01:38.297
<i>  desperate to prove</i>
<i>  they belong in the top 32.</i>

01:38.299 --> 01:41.400
<i>  That includes stars</i>
<i>  with their backs</i>
<i>  against the wall,</i>

01:41.402 --> 01:43.669
<i>  like the 0-1 minotaur.</i>

01:43.671 --> 01:47.439
<i>  Daniel freitas and the crew</i>
<i>  have traveled all the way</i>
<i>  from brazil</i>

01:47.441 --> 01:50.709
<i>  on a mission to hoist</i>
<i>  the giant nut this season.</i>

01:50.711 --> 01:56.415
<i>  Tonight, hungry rookie</i>
<i>  dragon slayer will look</i>
<i>  to stop them in their tracks.</i>

01:56.417 --> 01:59.585
<i> [kenny] and we'll see</i>
<i>  another mythical monster yeti</i>

01:59.587 --> 02:01.753
<i>  also try to secure</i>
<i>  its first win of the season.</i>

02:01.755 --> 02:04.256
<i>  Co-captains greg gibson</i>
<i>  and christian karlberg</i>

02:04.258 --> 02:06.959
<i>  know this could be win</i>
<i>  or go home,</i>

02:06.961 --> 02:11.630
<i>  as they take on a buck with</i>
<i>  a drum spinner even bigger</i>
<i>  than theirs, pain train.</i>

02:11.632 --> 02:14.900
<i> [chris] and at the top</i>
<i>  of the marquee tonight,</i>

02:14.902 --> 02:18.937
<i>  sit two of the most</i>
<i>  popular teams</i>
<i>  in all of robot combat.</i>

02:18.939 --> 02:20.706
<i>  After decimating</i>
<i>  their first opponent,</i>

02:20.708 --> 02:25.344
<i>  will bales at hypershock</i>
<i>  will look to put one of</i>
<i>  the greatest of all time,</i>

02:25.346 --> 02:31.150
<i>  donald hutson and lock-jaw</i>
<i>  into a serious 0-2 hole.</i>

02:31.152 --> 02:35.687
<i> [kenny] this is a must-win</i>
<i>  match for lock-jaw and for</i>
<i>  fan-favorite hypershock,</i>

02:35.689 --> 02:39.725
<i> a victory could mean that this</i>
<i>  season it's more than just</i>
<i>  a pretty face,</i>

02:39.727 --> 02:41.260
<i>  it's the contender.</i>

02:42.429 --> 02:44.663
<i> [chris] and speaking</i>
<i>  of contenders,</i>

02:44.665 --> 02:47.933
<i>  we kick off the night</i>
<i>  with a showdown between a bot</i>

02:47.935 --> 02:50.369
<i>  that could survive</i>
<i>  a nuclear bomb</i>

02:50.371 --> 02:53.405
<i>  and another that hits</i>
<i>  as hard as one.</i>

02:53.407 --> 02:57.843
<i>  Black dragon squares off</i>
<i>  with victor soto and rotator.</i>

02:57.845 --> 03:00.078
<i>  They're both 1-0,</i>

03:00.080 --> 03:02.981
<i>  get ready</i>
<i>  for some serious fireworks.</i>

03:04.118 --> 03:05.017
You ready?

03:05.019 --> 03:06.718
-I'm ready.
-I'm ready.

03:06.720 --> 03:07.719
You guys ready?

03:07.721 --> 03:09.354
[audience cheering]

03:11.625 --> 03:14.226
[chris] faruq, take it away.

03:16.163 --> 03:20.732
Ladies and gentlemen,
are you ready?

03:20.734 --> 03:24.002
It's robot fighting time.

03:24.004 --> 03:27.339
[audience cheering]

03:33.948 --> 03:38.350
[faruq] in the red square,
this bot might be golden,

03:38.352 --> 03:41.053
but it won't thank you
for being a friend,

03:41.055 --> 03:43.989
it'll straight up shake you
until you're meeting your end.

03:43.991 --> 03:45.757
It's not old, it's classic.

03:45.759 --> 03:47.826
It's ready to fight.

03:47.828 --> 03:50.996
It's straight up immortal,
just like betty white.

03:50.998 --> 03:53.465
It's rotator.

03:53.467 --> 03:55.968
[audience cheering]

03:58.639 --> 04:01.073
<i> [chris] hey, any time</i>
<i>  you can work betty white</i>
<i>  into the equation,</i>

04:01.075 --> 04:02.474
<i>  you're all right with me.</i>

04:02.476 --> 04:04.810
<i>  And here they come, rotator,</i>

04:04.812 --> 04:08.247
<i>  you know, kenny, rotator</i>
<i>  looked as destructive as ever</i>

04:08.249 --> 04:10.849
<i>  in its decision win</i>
<i>  over kraken.</i>

04:10.851 --> 04:14.586
<i>  But victor soto was happy</i>
<i>  about winning the control</i>
<i>  points in that one.</i>

04:14.588 --> 04:16.088
<i> [kenny] yeah, rotator</i>
<i>  has always had</i>

04:16.090 --> 04:18.657
<i>  one of the most devastating</i>
<i>  horizontal spinners,</i>

04:18.659 --> 04:23.428
<i>  but the wedge lets</i>
<i>  victor added to its backside</i>
<i> this season are game changers.</i>

04:23.430 --> 04:25.964
<i>  They really help him</i>
<i>  control the fight,</i>

04:25.966 --> 04:29.668
<i>  and tonight he'll use those</i>
<i>  to try and get</i>
<i>  under black dragon,</i>

04:29.670 --> 04:32.137
<i>  then whip around</i>
<i>  for a spin attack.</i>

04:34.408 --> 04:38.510
In the blue square,
this robot comes to us
from brazil.

04:38.512 --> 04:42.614
He has only two mottos,
to crush and to kill.

04:42.616 --> 04:45.917
So before you step in the box,
you better update your will.

04:45.919 --> 04:49.955
Introducing the tightest
feature high-speeding,
wire-eating, fire-breathing,

04:49.957 --> 04:53.558
entire reason
why you're bleeding,
black dragon.

04:53.560 --> 04:55.961
[audience cheering]

04:57.798 --> 05:00.565
<i> [chris] well, we've got two</i>
<i>  teams from brazil tonight,</i>

05:00.567 --> 05:03.468
<i>  but only one has</i>
<i>  the lucky duck,</i>

05:03.470 --> 05:07.172
<i> black dragon took down icewave</i>
<i>  in its first fight.</i>

05:07.174 --> 05:10.842
<i>  Kenny, this fire-breather</i>
<i>  is tough to kill.</i>

05:10.844 --> 05:12.678
<i> [kenny] yeah, it has</i>
<i>  a powerful egg-beater drum,</i>

05:12.680 --> 05:15.447
<i>  but their game</i>
<i>  is to outlast their opponent.</i>

05:15.449 --> 05:18.884
<i>  They've won fights completely</i>
<i>  engulfed in flames.</i>

05:18.886 --> 05:20.686
<i>  The key tonight, though,</i>
<i>  could be that wedge.</i>

05:20.688 --> 05:22.954
<i>  It has a slope and hardness</i>

05:22.956 --> 05:26.591
<i>  that were specifically</i>
<i>  designed to take a hit</i>
<i>  from rotator.</i>

05:26.593 --> 05:30.062
<i>  The brazilians are ready</i>
<i>  for this fight, chris.</i>

05:34.702 --> 05:36.635
Rotator is as ready
as it can be against
black dragon,

05:36.637 --> 05:38.570
one of the unique things
about rotator

05:38.572 --> 05:40.505
is that we use both the front
and the back of the robot,

05:40.507 --> 05:42.674
so we're going to have
these forks in the back.

05:42.676 --> 05:44.576
I'm going to start off
basically trying to get
underneath them to see

05:44.578 --> 05:47.412
if we can even get
underneath their plow.

05:47.414 --> 05:52.017
If not, attack with the front,
see if we can actually damage
some parts, bend them

05:52.019 --> 05:53.151
and then create
that clearance,

05:53.153 --> 05:54.953
so that we can get
underneath them
and control them.

05:54.955 --> 05:57.322
I want to get
all the points basically,
aggression, control, damage.

05:57.324 --> 05:58.857
I want to get it all.

05:58.859 --> 06:02.761
Over there is a really
reliable bot,
will be a three minutes fight.

06:02.763 --> 06:04.896
I want to go after
their weapons.

06:04.898 --> 06:07.332
I know that's where
I want to hit.

06:07.334 --> 06:10.635
I know that's where I
can handle the energy.

06:10.637 --> 06:15.374
So we will then just fight
because we have a special
wedge just made for rotator.

06:15.376 --> 06:18.610
And we'll try the most
to control the fights,

06:18.612 --> 06:22.781
counter their weapon
and push them
around the arena.

06:22.783 --> 06:26.051
We have a motto that you're
the best and destroy the rest.

06:26.053 --> 06:29.087
But now, rotator is the rest.

06:29.089 --> 06:32.090
[audience cheering]

06:33.994 --> 06:35.160
[robotic voice]
<i>  robots, activate.</i>

06:35.162 --> 06:38.997
[audience cheering]

06:38.999 --> 06:42.200
<i> [chris] for more on the crew</i>
<i>  that's from miami, florida,</i>
<i> we bring in our bot whisperer,</i>

06:42.202 --> 06:43.568
<i>  pete, what do you have?</i>

06:43.570 --> 06:47.706
Well, you know,
there's always some drama
that happens in the pits,

06:47.708 --> 06:52.043
and even a pro team
like victor's can sometimes
succumb to it.

06:52.045 --> 06:53.412
<i>  They're not immune.</i>

06:53.414 --> 06:54.880
<i>  Victor showed up here,</i>

06:54.882 --> 06:57.949
<i>  all of his</i>
<i>  lithium battery packs</i>
<i>  were puffed up,</i>

06:57.951 --> 06:59.184
<i> which means they were no good.</i>

06:59.186 --> 07:00.685
<i>  He couldn't use any.</i>

07:00.687 --> 07:03.622
<i>  He didn't have enough spares,</i>
<i>  because all of those</i>
<i>  were puffed.</i>

07:03.624 --> 07:06.725
<i>  So team mallis loaned them</i>
<i>  a complete set of packs,</i>

07:06.727 --> 07:08.493
<i>  which they ran</i>
<i>  in their last fight.</i>

07:08.495 --> 07:10.495
<i>  But the new packs</i>
<i>  have showed up,</i>

07:10.497 --> 07:13.999
<i>  they've put connectors on</i>
<i>  and they are ready to go.</i>

07:14.001 --> 07:16.401
[chris] so they'll be huffing
and puffing, perhaps...

07:16.403 --> 07:21.173
You don't want to puffing
with lithium battery packs,
really bad for you to puff.

07:25.012 --> 07:26.745
[robotic voice]
<i>  red team, ready?</i>

07:26.747 --> 07:28.914
<i>  Let's do it, man.</i>

07:28.916 --> 07:32.050
<i> [chris] do it,</i>
<i>  even the little guy</i>
<i>  packs a punch.</i>

07:34.822 --> 07:36.955
[robotic voice]
<i>  blue team, ready?</i>

07:39.026 --> 07:40.425
<i>  Let's go.</i>

07:40.427 --> 07:42.294
[audience cheering]

07:57.511 --> 08:01.780
<i> [chris] the brazilians versus</i>
<i>  the guy in gold,</i>

08:01.782 --> 08:05.250
<i>  the winner will move to 2-0</i>
<i>  on the season.</i>

08:09.990 --> 08:12.324
<i>  Let the bot battle begin.</i>

08:12.326 --> 08:14.860
<i>  Here comes that flame.</i>

08:14.862 --> 08:18.530
<i>  Oh-oh, rotator gets</i>
<i>  underneath, the brazilian's</i>
<i>  right out of the gate.</i>

08:18.532 --> 08:22.734
<i>  That is a bad news</i>
<i>  for black dragon, kenny.</i>

08:22.736 --> 08:25.303
<i> [kenny] we know victor</i>
<i>  was focused on winning</i>
<i>  the ground war,</i>

08:25.305 --> 08:28.640
<i>  and it looks like</i>
<i>  he's in great shape.</i>

08:28.642 --> 08:35.247
<i> [chris] oh, rotator lands and</i>
<i>  power shots to that custom</i>
<i>  front wedge of black dragon.</i>

08:36.617 --> 08:40.285
<i> [kenny] there goes victor</i>
<i>  with that forks</i>
<i>  first driving technique.</i>

08:40.287 --> 08:41.620
<i>  Let's see</i>
<i>  if he can do it again,</i>

08:41.922 --> 08:43.655
<i>  those forks are doing</i>
<i>  a great job</i>
<i>  of getting underneath.</i>

08:43.657 --> 08:45.524
<i> [chris] yeah.</i>

08:45.526 --> 08:48.360
<i>  Trying to work from the side</i>
<i>  and stay away from the mouth</i>
<i>  of that weapon and rotator,</i>

08:48.362 --> 08:52.030
<i>  oh, did a nice job</i>
<i>  getting under</i>
<i>  black dragon momentarily.</i>

08:52.032 --> 08:56.568
<i> [kenny] black dragon just</i>
<i> needs one good fight with that</i>
<i>  egg-beater weapon, chris.</i>

08:56.570 --> 09:00.705
<i> [chris] black dragon's got</i>
<i>  rotator against the rail,</i>
<i>  breaths a little fire.</i>

09:00.707 --> 09:05.243
<i>  Rotator lands a jab</i>
<i>  and gets itself out</i>
<i>  of a dangerous spot there.</i>

09:06.346 --> 09:10.649
<i>  Both drivers being</i>
<i>  very precise so far.</i>

09:10.651 --> 09:13.518
<i> [kenny] yeah, they both have</i>
<i>  a lot of respect for each</i>
<i>  other's primary weapons</i>

09:13.520 --> 09:15.120
<i>  and both trying to get...</i>

09:15.122 --> 09:17.622
<i>  Oh, black dragon,</i>
<i>  right back at it.</i>

09:17.624 --> 09:19.124
<i> [chris] that was some...</i>

09:19.126 --> 09:21.126
<i> [kenny] black dragon, now</i>
<i>  we got a ball of flame.</i>

09:21.128 --> 09:22.460
<i> [chris] wow.</i>

09:22.863 --> 09:25.230
<i>  Kenny, it's black dragon</i>
<i>  on fire</i>
<i>  on the right, right side.</i>

09:25.232 --> 09:26.398
<i> [kenny] yeah...</i>

09:26.400 --> 09:27.599
<i> [chris] we've seen him</i>
<i>  on flames before,</i>

09:27.601 --> 09:33.471
<i>  but this is not a good time</i>
<i>  to do it... Off rotator.</i>

09:33.473 --> 09:37.776
<i>  And rotator had to be</i>
<i>  working off at the side there</i>
<i>  for a segment now,</i>

09:37.778 --> 09:40.879
<i>  we've seen it before,</i>
<i>  we mentioned it</i>
<i>  in the pre-fight,</i>

09:40.881 --> 09:43.648
<i>  black dragon's been able</i>
<i>  to work while on fire.</i>

09:43.650 --> 09:44.950
<i> [kenny] oh.</i>

09:44.952 --> 09:47.686
<i> [chris] can they continue</i>
<i>  to do so here tonight?</i>

09:47.688 --> 09:51.389
<i> [kenny] well,</i>
<i>  we all know about</i>
<i>  the durability of rotator.</i>

09:51.391 --> 09:54.359
<i>  Can black dragon</i>
<i>  match it here?</i>

09:55.429 --> 09:57.996
<i> [chris] oh, big shot</i>
<i>  there by rotator.</i>

09:57.998 --> 10:02.000
<i>  Black dragon's weapon</i>
<i>  no longer spinning.</i>

10:02.002 --> 10:03.301
<i> [kenny] oh.</i>

10:03.303 --> 10:06.204
<i>  Can he make it another minute</i>
<i>  and force a judge's decision?</i>

10:06.206 --> 10:10.141
<i> [chris] now, it's become</i>
<i>  a bit of a pushing match</i>
<i>  here for black dragon.</i>

10:10.143 --> 10:13.645
<i>  Just follow the smoke</i>
<i>  if you can't find it,</i>
<i>  follow the smoke.</i>

10:13.647 --> 10:16.781
<i>  Black dragon</i>
<i>  shadowing rotator now,</i>

10:16.783 --> 10:21.019
<i>  preventing from doing</i>
<i>  any more damage</i>
<i>  with that undercutting blade.</i>

10:22.189 --> 10:24.389
<i> Closing in on a 45-second mark</i>

10:24.391 --> 10:28.727
<i>  and somehow black dragon</i>
<i>  had been able to do it again,</i>
<i>  kenny.</i>

10:28.729 --> 10:31.696
<i> [kenny] yeah, they're doing</i>
<i>  an amazing job</i>
<i>  with that wedge,</i>

10:31.698 --> 10:33.965
<i>  sticking it out here,</i>
<i>  staying alive.</i>

10:33.967 --> 10:35.734
<i> [chris] victor soto pinning</i>
<i>  black dragon,</i>

10:35.736 --> 10:39.004
<i>  showing excellent</i>
<i>  control here.</i>

10:39.006 --> 10:41.640
<i>  Look for victor to tail whip</i>
<i> the brazilians on the release.</i>

10:41.642 --> 10:43.575
<i> -[victor] release.</i>
<i>  -Release.</i>

10:43.577 --> 10:46.878
<i> [chris] there's the release</i>
<i>  and there's the tail whip,</i>

10:46.880 --> 10:48.613
<i>  20 seconds left to go</i>
<i>  in this one.</i>

10:48.615 --> 10:49.714
<i> [kenny] oh.</i>

10:49.716 --> 10:52.651
<i> [chris] black dragon getting</i>
<i>  underneath rotator,</i>

10:52.653 --> 10:55.353
<i>  but that undercutting blade</i>
<i>  won't stop spinning.</i>

10:55.355 --> 10:58.723
<i>  Rotator continuing</i>
<i>  to dish out the damage.</i>

10:58.725 --> 11:02.961
<i> [kenny] yeah. Rotator</i>
<i>  attacking from above</i>
<i>  like an attack helicopter.</i>

11:02.963 --> 11:03.928
<i> [chris] five seconds.</i>

11:03.930 --> 11:05.063
[loud thud]

11:05.065 --> 11:07.332
<i> [chris] oh, that's a big hit.</i>

11:07.901 --> 11:09.567
[audience cheering]

11:09.603 --> 11:16.408
<i> [chris] somehow black dragon</i>
<i>  made it the last 90 seconds</i>
<i>  once while on fire.</i>

11:16.410 --> 11:20.111
<i> [kenny] I know which team</i>
<i>  I'm inviting to my house</i>
<i>  for the barbecue,</i>

11:20.113 --> 11:24.049
<i>  because those guys</i>
<i>  can party it up</i>
<i> when there is smoke and flame.</i>

11:24.051 --> 11:25.150
<i>  Wow!</i>

11:25.152 --> 11:28.119
[audience cheering]

11:28.121 --> 11:32.490
<i> [chris] so this fire fest</i>
<i>  is now in the hands</i>
<i>  of the judges and, kenny,</i>

11:32.492 --> 11:34.426
<i>  don't tell ja rule,</i>

11:34.428 --> 11:36.961
<i>  but we're going</i>
<i>  to let the crew</i>
<i>  clean up this mess.</i>

11:36.963 --> 11:40.098
<i>  It will have the decision</i>
<i>  to this bot burner,</i>

11:40.100 --> 11:43.568
<i>  when we return on battlebots.</i>

11:43.570 --> 11:47.338
[audience cheering]

11:52.179 --> 11:53.812
<i> [chris] welcome back</i>
<i>  to battlebots,</i>

11:53.814 --> 11:58.550
<i> where rotator and black dragon</i>
<i>  are awaiting a decision</i>
<i>  after their insane fight</i>

11:58.552 --> 12:04.055
<i>  that saw the brazilians</i>
<i>  on fire for more than</i>
<i>  90 seconds.</i>

12:04.057 --> 12:07.425
<i> [kenny] the smoke is still</i>
<i>  getting cleared out,</i>
<i>  but we're being told</i>

12:07.427 --> 12:10.795
<i>  that the judges are close to</i>
<i>  handing out their scorecards.</i>

12:10.797 --> 12:13.898
<i> [chris] all three former</i>
<i> battlebots participants,</i>

12:13.900 --> 12:17.502
<i>  derek young, jason bardis,</i>
<i>  lisa winter,</i>

12:17.504 --> 12:19.738
<i> scoring on an 11-point system,</i>

12:19.740 --> 12:22.574
<i>  up to five points</i>
<i>  can be awarded</i>
<i>  for damage,</i>

12:22.576 --> 12:27.011
<i>  three for aggression</i>
<i>  and three for control.</i>

12:27.781 --> 12:31.382
<i>  You know kenny,</i>
<i>  here at battlebots,</i>
<i>  the lower bot usually wins,</i>

12:31.384 --> 12:36.821
<i>  and rotator proved</i>
<i>  it was the low man</i>
<i>  right out of the gate.</i>

12:36.823 --> 12:41.326
<i> [kenny] yeah, rotator using</i>
<i>  its ground scraping forks</i>
<i> to get underneath black dragon</i>

12:41.328 --> 12:43.394
<i>  and drive it</i>
<i>  into the pulverizer,</i>

12:43.396 --> 12:45.597
<i>  then start going to work</i>
<i>  with the undercutter</i>

12:45.599 --> 12:51.636
<i>  and that shot right there set</i>
<i>  the brazilians up in flames.</i>

12:51.638 --> 12:55.306
<i> [chris] and I feel like</i>
<i>  I've seen this movie</i>
<i>  somewhere before,</i>

12:55.308 --> 12:58.643
<i>  but black dragon managed</i>
<i> to put up one heck of a fight,</i>

12:58.645 --> 13:03.815
<i>  even though it was spewing</i>
<i>  smoke and flames</i>
<i>  for almost two minutes.</i>

13:03.817 --> 13:06.351
<i>  Now, this is probably</i>
<i> the crowning shot of the night</i>

13:06.353 --> 13:09.988
<i>  for black dragon</i>
<i>  to get rotator on its side.</i>

13:09.990 --> 13:15.860
<i>  But victor soto did regain</i>
<i>  control and he delivered</i>
<i>  down the stretch.</i>

13:15.862 --> 13:19.831
<i> [kenny] just an amazing</i>
<i>  all-around performance</i>
<i>  by the veteran here,</i>

13:19.833 --> 13:22.834
<i>  showing great control</i>
<i>  by pinning black dragon,</i>

13:22.836 --> 13:24.903
<i>  then attacking</i>
<i>  with the undercutter,</i>

13:24.905 --> 13:27.639
<i>  he managed to disable</i>
<i>  black dragon's weapon</i>

13:27.641 --> 13:30.008
<i>  and really dominate</i>
<i>  this fight.</i>

13:30.644 --> 13:33.511
<i> [chris] rotator looking</i>
<i>  to move to 2-0,</i>

13:33.513 --> 13:35.980
<i>  black dragon</i>
<i>  as tough as they come,</i>

13:35.982 --> 13:39.417
<i>  let's send it over to faruq</i>
<i>  with the decision.</i>

13:41.087 --> 13:44.055
The results
from the judges are in.

13:44.791 --> 13:47.091
[audience cheering]

13:48.929 --> 13:52.163
we have
a unanimous decision...

13:54.935 --> 13:57.368
And your winner is...

13:59.806 --> 14:00.972
Rotator.

14:00.974 --> 14:03.074
[audience cheering]

14:11.785 --> 14:12.984
[man] great play, guys.

14:12.986 --> 14:14.752
[man] thank you.

14:14.754 --> 14:16.020
Thank you.

14:16.022 --> 14:17.455
[chris] victor.

14:17.457 --> 14:18.723
-Hey.
-Hey.

14:18.725 --> 14:21.626
Congratulations,
usually when you
set your opponent on fire,

14:21.628 --> 14:24.028
you're like, "huh, okay,
this will be easy."

14:24.030 --> 14:27.832
for almost two minutes,
that thing ran
while there were smoke,

14:27.834 --> 14:28.733
how impressed were you?

14:28.735 --> 14:29.801
Very impressive.

14:29.803 --> 14:31.903
Black dragon
is a great machine,
very reliable.

14:31.905 --> 14:35.406
I was hoping for a knockout,
but couldn't get there.

14:35.408 --> 14:37.475
You know that was
to be expected.
Great machine.

14:37.477 --> 14:38.643
But we were able to get
some control,

14:38.645 --> 14:42.413
get underneath them
and I guess
we had some damage.

14:42.415 --> 14:45.516
I couldn't see really clear
between the smoke and all.

14:45.518 --> 14:48.553
All right.
So what is a 2-0 start
mean for you?

14:48.555 --> 14:52.123
It's huge.
We've never been 2-0 before,
so this is fantastic.

14:52.125 --> 14:53.057
Confidence is going through
the roof.

14:53.059 --> 14:54.792
We're trusting the robot more.

14:54.794 --> 14:55.927
We're learning more about it.

14:55.929 --> 14:57.896
We're going to keep improving.

14:57.898 --> 14:59.597
[chris] all right, victor.
Well, congratulations.

14:59.599 --> 15:00.999
We'll see you next time.

15:01.001 --> 15:02.400
-Thank you.
-Great fight.
Thank you.

15:02.402 --> 15:04.135
[victor] thank you.

15:08.775 --> 15:10.275
<i> [chris] okay.</i>

15:10.277 --> 15:14.779
<i>  Let's keep the carnage going</i>
<i>  and jump right into</i>
<i>  fight number two</i>

15:14.781 --> 15:17.415
<i>  and the international</i>
<i>  theme continues.</i>

15:17.417 --> 15:21.085
<i>  Canada and south korea</i>
<i>  take center stage this time.</i>

15:21.087 --> 15:25.957
<i>  That's where our</i>
<i>  next two teams, lucky</i>
<i>  and blade hail from.</i>

15:25.959 --> 15:29.460
Let's start with
mark demers and that
flipper known as lucky.

15:29.462 --> 15:30.995
<i>  In their first fight,</i>

15:31.698 --> 15:35.700
<i>  they went toe-to-toe</i>
<i>  with a semifinalist</i>
<i>  from last season, tantrum</i>

15:35.702 --> 15:37.468
<i>  and new driver matt olsen.</i>

15:37.470 --> 15:40.738
<i>  He looks like he may be</i>
<i>  the real deal.</i>

15:40.740 --> 15:45.743
<i> [kenny] yeah, there's a reason</i>
<i>  he's known as one of the top</i>
<i>  rc car drivers in the world.</i>

15:45.745 --> 15:49.747
<i>  This rookie came out</i>
<i>  the first 30 seconds</i>
<i>  of his battlebots career</i>

15:49.749 --> 15:51.549
<i>  and had a top tier opponent</i>
<i>  on the ropes.</i>

15:51.551 --> 15:54.385
<i>  He actually could have let</i>
<i>  tantrum get counted out,</i>

15:54.387 --> 15:58.556
<i>  but he kept the fight going</i>
<i>  and showed some</i>
<i>  serious competitive spirit.</i>

15:58.558 --> 16:02.126
<i>  I'm excited to see</i>
<i>  what this kid does</i>
<i>  in his second fight, chris.</i>

16:02.896 --> 16:04.595
<i> [chris] and when it comes</i>
<i>  to blade,</i>

16:04.597 --> 16:08.633
<i>  the bot known overseas</i>
<i>  as the korean tombstone</i>

16:08.635 --> 16:12.804
<i>  did go three minutes</i>
<i>  in a very tough matchup</i>
<i>  against scorpios,</i>

16:12.806 --> 16:15.406
<i>  but they did not live up</i>
<i>  to the hype, kenny.</i>

16:15.408 --> 16:16.541
<i> [kenny] yeah,</i>
<i>  captain cheog gyu hwang</i>

16:16.543 --> 16:19.677
<i>  needs to show us</i>
<i>  something in this fight.</i>

16:19.679 --> 16:22.580
<i>  I've seen them dish out</i>
<i>  tons of damage</i>
<i>  in international matches.</i>

16:22.582 --> 16:24.615
<i>  Maybe it was jet lag,</i>

16:24.617 --> 16:27.618
<i>  maybe it was just being</i>
<i>  under the battlebots lights</i>
<i>  for the first time.</i>

16:27.620 --> 16:29.887
<i>  Either way, we need to see</i>
<i>  that weapon spin up</i>

16:29.889 --> 16:32.323
<i>  and do some serious</i>
<i>  damage tonight.</i>

16:35.261 --> 16:37.562
Somebody's getting
win number one tonight.

16:37.564 --> 16:39.063
Faruq.

16:40.667 --> 16:44.902
In the red square
from ottawa, canada,

16:44.904 --> 16:47.805
here comes the canuck
with all the luck,

16:47.807 --> 16:49.540
it's lucky.

16:49.542 --> 16:52.310
[audience cheering]

16:53.680 --> 16:58.049
<i> [chris] team lucky,</i>
<i>  almost looking like</i>
<i>  the canadian flag kenny.</i>

16:58.051 --> 17:00.385
<i> [kenny] and going against</i>
<i>  the horizontal spinner</i>
<i>  tonight.</i>

17:00.387 --> 17:02.954
<i>  How do they match up?</i>

17:02.956 --> 17:07.058
<i> [chris] well, you can see</i>
<i>  they've got that ar-500 armor</i>
<i>  that goes all the way around,</i>

17:07.060 --> 17:08.426
<i>  lucky this time.</i>

17:08.428 --> 17:11.429
<i>  They've seen how powerful</i>
<i>  blade has been overseas,</i>

17:11.431 --> 17:13.865
<i>  but lucky should be able</i>
<i>  to get under them.</i>

17:13.867 --> 17:17.568
<i>  And if they can trap blade</i>
<i>  in a short corner</i>
<i>  and they spin up,</i>

17:17.570 --> 17:20.972
<i>  matt olsen could</i>
<i>  have a field day.</i>

17:23.943 --> 17:29.981
[faruq] in the blue square
from seoul, south korea,
ready to mash your unit.

17:29.983 --> 17:32.817
Give it up for blade.

17:32.819 --> 17:35.253
[audience cheering]

17:37.724 --> 17:40.792
<i> [chris] such a cool looking</i>
<i>  robot, and once again,</i>

17:40.794 --> 17:44.162
<i>  the driver is ju sangeun</i>
<i>  on the right there.</i>

17:44.164 --> 17:45.830
<i>  She's actually</i>
<i>  a professional violinist,</i>

17:45.832 --> 17:49.067
<i>  so she's used to performing</i>
<i>  under pressure, kenny.</i>

17:49.869 --> 17:51.636
<i> [kenny] well,</i>
<i>  all eyes are on her,</i>

17:51.638 --> 17:53.838
<i>  because they need a win</i>
<i>  here against scorpios,</i>

17:53.840 --> 17:56.040
<i>  she couldn't find space</i>
<i>  to spin up,</i>

17:56.042 --> 17:58.342
<i>  tonight they're using</i>
<i>  their longest bar,</i>

17:58.344 --> 18:01.612
<i>  it's three feet and 60 pounds</i>
<i>  of aluminum.</i>

18:01.614 --> 18:05.817
<i>  With that extra reach,</i>
<i>  they're hoping they can get</i>
<i>  in one big early shot</i>

18:05.819 --> 18:09.387
<i>  and end this fight before</i>
<i>  lucky can start the flipper.</i>

18:17.197 --> 18:18.830
Blade is a really
tough machine.

18:18.832 --> 18:21.532
It's going to be
a lot of large hits.

18:21.534 --> 18:24.902
We're hoping to deflect
blades blade.

18:24.904 --> 18:27.472
If we're going to win, I think
we're going to have to win
within three or four hits,

18:27.474 --> 18:29.640
hopefully get them
flipped over.

18:29.642 --> 18:32.343
If it goes to the full
three minutes, I'm pretty
sure we're taking damage.

18:32.345 --> 18:34.045
We're all in one right now,

18:34.047 --> 18:37.081
so that really puts
a lot of pressure on us
to win that next match.

18:37.083 --> 18:39.083

<i> [chris] oh, gosh.</i>

<i>  Blade just snapped</i>
<i>  its blade and left a piece</i>

19:32.338 --> 19:35.773

<i> [kenny] doesn't get</i>

<i>  the spin around,</i>

19:57.797 --> 19:59.597
<i>  flipper trying to knock</i>
<i>  the blade off,</i>

19:59.599 --> 20:03.768
<i>  but now,</i>
<i> just got to hang out up there.</i>

20:03.770 --> 20:09.407
<i>  That's it, it's just</i>
<i>  going to sit and chill</i>
<i> as lucky picks up the victory.</i>

20:09.409 --> 20:11.108

20:12.011 --> 20:13.377
<i> [kenny] what a knockout.</i>

20:15.982 --> 20:17.949
<i> [chris] wow.</i>

20:20.520 --> 20:24.822
<i>  Kenny, impressive, impressive</i>
<i>  run by lucky right there.</i>

20:24.824 --> 20:28.593
<i> [kenny] yeah, absolutely,</i>
<i>  and a great choice to go</i>
<i>  with that ar armor,</i>

20:28.595 --> 20:31.395
<i>  it caused blade</i>
<i>  to slam into the rail</i>

20:31.397 --> 20:33.764
<i>  and broke that three-foot</i>
<i>  aluminum bar off</i>

20:33.766 --> 20:35.399
<i>  into the side</i>
<i>  of the battle box.</i>

20:35.401 --> 20:38.436
<i>  -Look at that, crazy.</i>
<i> -[chris] yeah.</i>

20:38.438 --> 20:43.374
<i> Blade on its heels after that,</i>
<i>  a little flippage from lucky,</i>

20:43.376 --> 20:47.878
<i>  send it politely</i>
<i>  to the top of the side rail</i>
<i>  to be counted out.</i>

20:47.880 --> 20:51.816
<i>  Rookie driver, matt olsen,</i>
<i>  with yet another</i>
<i>  sensational performance,</i>

20:51.818 --> 20:55.119
<i>  as lucky moves to 1-1.</i>

20:56.990 --> 20:58.990
What are you feeling,
lucky, huh?

20:58.992 --> 21:00.424
[laughing]

21:02.428 --> 21:05.062
<i> kenny, I love battlebots,</i>

21:05.064 --> 21:07.431
'show and tell',
it's my favorite day
of the school year.

21:07.433 --> 21:09.233
It is.
I get to hold the prop here.

21:09.235 --> 21:10.801
-Oh my gosh.
-Do not touch the top of it.

21:10.803 --> 21:12.703
It is very sharp,

21:12.705 --> 21:16.807
but this is the tip
of the blade
that broke off of blade.

21:16.809 --> 21:18.576
-And stuck right
into the wall.
-[kenny] yes.

21:18.578 --> 21:21.812
-[chris] that is incredible
force.
-[kenny] crazy. Very heavy.

21:21.814 --> 21:25.049
If you didn't get your bi's
and tri's then you might
want to start lifting this.

21:25.051 --> 21:26.150
No, I'm good
with just the air.

21:26.152 --> 21:27.251
You're good. Okay.

21:27.253 --> 21:28.352
<i> [chris] coming up.</i>

21:28.354 --> 21:31.422
<i>  One of the most ferocious</i>
<i>  drivers in the sport.</i>

<i>  He's determined</i>
<i>  to will his team back</i>

<i>  Stop yelling at me,</i>

<i>  daniel freitas in minotaur</i>
<i>  facing the undefeated rookie,</i>
<i>  dragon slayer.</i>

21:42.001 --> 21:46.003
<i>  That's up next on battlebots.</i>

21:53.046 --> 21:55.079
[audience cheering]

21:56.549 --> 22:00.685
we are back
<i> on battlebots and guess</i>
<i> who's back inside the box.</i>

22:00.687 --> 22:03.587
<i>  It's brazilian bazooka,</i>
<i>  minotaur</i>

22:03.589 --> 22:08.826
<i>  in desperate need of a win</i>
<i>  here tonight against rookie,</i>
<i>  dragon slayer,</i>

22:08.828 --> 22:11.696
<i>  and let's start with</i>
<i>  the boys from texas.</i>

22:11.698 --> 22:16.901
<i>  A group of young machinists</i>
<i>  led by 22-year-old captain,</i>
<i>  jordan neal.</i>

22:16.903 --> 22:21.005
<i>  Kenny, dragon slayer beat up</i>
<i>  on respected veteran, duck</i>

22:21.007 --> 22:23.541
<i>  in its very first</i>
<i> battlebots fight ever.</i>

22:23.543 --> 22:25.142
<i> [kenny] that's right.</i>

22:25.144 --> 22:29.413
<i>  And while dragon slayers</i>
<i>  vertical disc may not pack</i>
<i>  a nuclear punch,</i>

22:29.415 --> 22:32.683
<i>  it was able to rip the beak</i>
<i>  right off of duck</i>
<i>  in its debut.</i>

22:32.685 --> 22:36.854
<i>  But minotaur is in quite</i>
<i> a different class offensively,</i>

22:36.856 --> 22:40.658
so this should be
a good indicator for them
to where they stand here,

22:40.660 --> 22:42.526
amongst all teams.

22:42.528 --> 22:44.528
<i> [chris] and when it comes</i>
<i>  to minotaur,</i>

22:44.530 --> 22:48.132
<i>  this is one of the most</i>
<i>  popular robots</i>
<i>  in the entire world.</i>

22:48.134 --> 22:52.570
<i>  Led this year by captain,</i>
<i> junior souza, they sit at 0-1.</i>

22:52.572 --> 22:58.409
<i> And even though that loss came</i>
<i> at the hands of one of the top</i>
<i> teams in the field, saw blaze,</i>

22:58.411 --> 23:01.612
<i>  these guys cannot afford</i>
<i>  to take another l tonight,</i>

23:01.614 --> 23:04.615
<i>  especially against</i>
<i>  the rookie robot.</i>

23:04.617 --> 23:07.785
<i> [kenny] no doubt, they are</i>
<i>  fired up and ready to go,</i>

23:07.787 --> 23:11.622
<i>  no one more so</i>
<i>  than their driver,</i>
<i>  daniel freitas,</i>

23:11.624 --> 23:13.924
<i>  his ferocity,</i>
<i>  nearly brought this team</i>

23:13.926 --> 23:17.728
<i>  to a battlebots championship</i>
<i>  in 2018.</i>

23:17.730 --> 23:20.765
<i>  But for minotaur</i>
<i>  spiritual leader,</i>

23:20.767 --> 23:24.034
<i>  this season is about</i>
<i>  something bigger than robots.</i>

23:29.742 --> 23:31.108
[daniel speaking]

25:18.484 --> 25:22.319
[audience cheering]

25:27.760 --> 25:30.261
<i> [chris] kenny, it's hard</i>
<i>  not to root for daniel</i>

25:30.263 --> 25:32.830
<i>  and these guys</i>
<i>  on team minotaur.</i>

25:32.832 --> 25:37.701
<i> [kenny] but he's here</i>
<i>  doing what he loves and he</i>
<i>  wants to win that nut.</i>

25:37.703 --> 25:40.104
All right,
let's get it going. Faruq.

25:42.775 --> 25:48.812
In the red square
from rio de janeiro, brazil,
the most ball-headed bot,

25:48.814 --> 25:53.317
the sport has ever seen,
it's minotaur.

25:53.319 --> 25:55.319
[audience cheering]

25:57.757 --> 26:02.760
<i> [chris] daniel freitas,</i>
<i>  the driver,</i>
<i>  always has his game face on,</i>

26:02.762 --> 26:05.996
<i>  ready to lead minotaur</i>
<i>  into battle.</i>

26:05.998 --> 26:07.464
<i>  That drum is so nasty, kenny.</i>

26:07.466 --> 26:09.066
<i> [kenny] it sure is.</i>

26:09.669 --> 26:15.606
<i>  That is a 55-pound drum</i>
<i> and it's wider than we've seen</i>
<i>  it in previous seasons.</i>

26:15.608 --> 26:17.441
<i>  We know daniel</i>
<i>  will be aggressive,</i>

26:17.443 --> 26:20.411
<i>  but with dragon slayer's,</i>
<i>  huge plow,</i>

26:20.413 --> 26:24.315
<i>  the key will be aggressively</i>
<i>  attacking from the side.</i>

26:25.985 --> 26:29.820
[faruq] in the blue square
from denton, texas,

26:29.822 --> 26:32.990
giving opponents
and khaleesi nightmares,

26:32.992 --> 26:36.026
it's dragon slayer.

26:36.028 --> 26:38.295
[audience cheering]

26:40.099 --> 26:42.833
<i> [chris] there is</i>
<i>  dragon slayer.</i>

26:42.835 --> 26:46.403
<i> Kenny, what do they have to do</i>
<i>  to take down the raging bull?</i>

26:46.405 --> 26:47.838
<i> [kenny] well, two things.</i>

26:48.307 --> 26:52.509
<i>  One, keep that plow</i>
<i>  square with minotaur's drum</i>
<i>  at all times</i>

26:52.511 --> 26:56.480
<i>  and two, get that weapon</i>
<i>  up to full speed.</i>

26:56.482 --> 27:00.584
<i>  Jordan said their disc</i>
<i>  wasn't functioning properly</i>
<i>  against duck.</i>

27:00.586 --> 27:02.886
<i>  They're going</i>
<i>  with a smaller disc tonight,</i>

27:02.888 --> 27:06.657
<i>  and they've also increased</i>
<i>  the battery power</i>
<i>  behind the weapon.</i>

27:06.659 --> 27:09.426
<i>  Let's see if those changes</i>
<i>  pay off.</i>

27:14.400 --> 27:16.967
For this next fight,
we're juicing it up a little.

27:16.969 --> 27:19.403
We're going from six-cell
to eight-cell in all systems.

27:19.405 --> 27:21.939
Hopefully, that's going
to give us enough punch
we need to fight minotaur.

27:21.941 --> 27:23.040
We switched our weapons.

27:23.042 --> 27:24.942
We actually went down
a little bit.

27:24.944 --> 27:26.243
We went with
our lighter weapon

27:26.245 --> 27:27.978
in order to compensate
for that extra juice
we're given to it.

27:27.980 --> 27:29.546
We're open for
a line of tip speed.

27:29.548 --> 27:31.382
This weapon's got
a little more reach.

27:31.384 --> 27:34.418
We switched our scoops,
they're a little more
heavily armored.

27:34.420 --> 27:37.454
Honestly, it's not
the worst fight
we could possibly have,

27:37.456 --> 27:39.023
but damn if it ain't scary,

27:39.025 --> 27:43.627
we could leave with another
victory chip in our hands
or a smoking wreck.

27:43.629 --> 27:45.062
Dragon slayer is a new bot.

27:45.064 --> 27:46.597
They did pretty well
against duck.

27:46.599 --> 27:49.933
They have a wedge
on the front,
so we have the old forks.

27:49.935 --> 27:55.372
We're really hoping to get
underneath their wedge
and just make it gone.

27:55.374 --> 27:57.408
We've got to avoid
the weapon as well,

27:57.410 --> 28:01.111
because it can be a really
powerful and damage minotaur.

28:01.113 --> 28:06.050
But we've got to go forward
and make sure that we hit them
strong as we can

28:06.052 --> 28:07.851
to try to go for a knockout.

28:07.853 --> 28:10.154

<i> [chris] minotaur's season</i>
<i>  may rest on the shoulders</i>

<i> [chris] we are right back</i>

<i>  here on battlebots,</i>

<i>  their outstanding driver,</i>
<i>  daniel freitas,</i>

<i> [chris] let the bot battle</i>
<i>  begin.</i>

<i>  Here comes dragon slayer,</i>
<i>  not afraid of minotaur</i>

29:39.912 --> 29:44.014
<i>  until you hear that drum</i>
<i>  spinning... And two bots</i>
<i>  go weapon on weapon.</i>

<i>  Minotaur still humming.</i>

<i>  Oh, oh, look at this.</i>

<i>  dragon slayer into the</i>
<i>  upper deck, didn't happen.</i>

29:54.593 --> 29:57.828
-You drive this on your
own money.
-Okay.

29:57.830 --> 30:00.764
<i> [chris] and it looks like</i>
<i>  minotaur has knocked</i>
<i>  dragon slayer's weapon</i>

30:00.766 --> 30:03.834
<i>  out of commission</i>
<i>  to start this fight.</i>

30:03.836 --> 30:06.203
<i>  But here's dragon</i>
<i>  slayer pushing back.</i>

30:06.205 --> 30:07.871
<i> Daniel freitas finds an angle.</i>

30:07.873 --> 30:11.275
<i>  Oh, starts chewing</i>
<i>  away at those tires.</i>

30:11.277 --> 30:13.744
<i> [kenny] yeah.</i>
<i>  He eats tires for breakfast.</i>

30:13.746 --> 30:18.048
<i> [chris] dragon slayer</i>
<i>  still has its wedge</i>
<i>  in play though, kenny.</i>

30:18.050 --> 30:21.585
<i> [kenny] that's right</i>
<i>  and jordan neal has to use</i>
<i>  that big wedge</i>

30:21.587 --> 30:24.254
<i>  to see if he can break</i>
<i>  minotaur's weapon.</i>

30:24.256 --> 30:26.924

<i>  good luck with that pal,</i>

<i>  for the count.</i>

30:39.405 --> 30:41.104
<i> [kenny] yeah.</i>
<i>  That might have been</i>
<i>  the knockout shot.</i>

30:41.106 --> 30:42.606
<i>  Him on the backside.</i>

<i>  daniel just lost his mom</i>

of athletes and competitors

33:59.905 --> 34:01.738
in whatever field you are in,

34:01.740 --> 34:07.878
if you come back to a place
where you know you are in love
<i> like battlebots,</i>

34:07.880 --> 34:12.215

the pain away entirely.

34:12.217 --> 34:13.483
Absolutely.

34:13.485 --> 34:17.587
But you said it best,
I mean, that is like
his second family.

34:17.589 --> 34:20.624
<i>  It's got to feel good,</i>
<i>  you know, after everything</i>
<i>  that he's dealt with</i>

<i>  to go out there</i>
<i>  and do what he loves</i>

34:21.927 --> 34:24.861
<i>  and to get a win</i>
<i>  for him and his team.</i>

out there.
-Yeah.

<i> and we talked with greg gibson</i>
<i>  earlier today.</i>

<i>  He said, listen,</i>
<i>  I have to admit</i>
<i>  I was nervous last month.</i>

35:13.145 --> 35:16.079
<i>  It was the first time</i>
<i> I was in the box in two years.</i>

35:16.081 --> 35:17.280
<i>  He said, guess what?</i>

35:17.282 --> 35:19.749
<i>  I'm going to let it roll</i>
<i> and we might see the old yeti,</i>

35:19.751 --> 35:20.617
<i>  I think,</i>
<i>  a little bit more tonight.</i>

35:20.619 --> 35:22.052
[kenny] I think so.

35:22.054 --> 35:24.387
Listen, he said,
he's always nervous
for that first fight.

35:24.389 --> 35:26.723
He said he's a complete wreck

35:26.725 --> 35:30.460
<i>  and again, this yeti</i>
<i> is very different from the bot</i>
<i>  we saw two years ago.</i>

35:30.462 --> 35:32.395
<i>  It's much smaller.</i>

35:32.397 --> 35:35.332
<i>  But both captains know</i>
<i>  when it comes</i>
<i>  to making the tournament,</i>

35:35.334 --> 35:38.969
<i>  tonight is a do</i>
<i>  or die situation.</i>

35:38.971 --> 35:41.605
All right, so with pain train,
they're captained
by evan arias,

35:41.607 --> 35:44.875
they had a rough rookie season
in 2020,

35:44.877 --> 35:48.979
<i>  high expectations,</i>
<i>  they end up getting ko'd</i>
<i>  in their first fight.</i>

35:48.981 --> 35:51.014
<i>  They got a start</i>
<i>  to turn it around</i>
<i>  a little bit.</i>

35:51.016 --> 35:52.849
<i> [kenny] yeah, that's right.</i>

35:52.851 --> 35:54.084
<i>  We talked about it.</i>

35:54.119 --> 35:55.418
<i>  But evan</i>
<i>  is one of the top drivers</i>
<i>  in the world,</i>

35:55.420 --> 35:57.420
<i>  when it comes</i>
<i>  to lower weight classes,</i>

35:57.422 --> 36:02.559
<i>  one of his robots</i>
<i>  actually just got put in</i>
<i> the beetleweight hall of fame.</i>

36:02.561 --> 36:07.597
<i>  He really wants to prove that</i>
<i>  he belongs in the big leagues</i>
<i>  and no better way to do that</i>

36:07.599 --> 36:11.134
<i>  than by taking down</i>
<i>  a legendary bot, like yeti.</i>

36:11.770 --> 36:13.803
Somebody's getting
a win number one.

36:13.805 --> 36:16.072
Will it be pain train
or will it be yeti?

36:16.074 --> 36:17.774
Let's find out. Faruq.

36:17.776 --> 36:20.410
[audience cheering]

36:22.381 --> 36:27.417
in the red square
from san luis obispo,
california,

36:27.419 --> 36:30.987
this ice monster
will leave you
shaking in your snow boots.

36:30.989 --> 36:32.923
It's yeti.

36:32.925 --> 36:35.358
[audience cheering]

36:39.565 --> 36:42.499
<i> [chris] a fan favorite, yeti,</i>

36:42.501 --> 36:48.271
<i>  about 80% of its size</i>
<i>  from 2019</i>
<i>  went on the old diet.</i>

36:48.273 --> 36:50.907
<i>  Is that [indistinct] at all,</i>
<i>  do you think?</i>

36:50.909 --> 36:53.643
<i> [kenny] you know,</i>
<i>  greg is still getting</i>
<i>  used to handling</i>

36:53.645 --> 36:55.845
<i>  this more compact version</i>
<i>  of yeti.</i>

36:55.847 --> 36:59.583
<i>  This fight is massive drum</i>
<i>  versus massive drum, though.</i>

36:59.585 --> 37:00.650
<i>  And yeti's got</i>
<i>  the smaller one,</i>

37:00.652 --> 37:04.721
<i>  so contrary to their</i>
<i>  typical game plan,</i>

37:04.723 --> 37:07.424
<i>  they want to be cautious</i>
<i>  and avoid going</i>
<i>  weapon to weapon here.</i>

37:07.426 --> 37:09.426
[audience cheering]

37:11.563 --> 37:16.933
in the blue square
from staten island, new york,
known as thomas, the train's

37:16.935 --> 37:21.204
terrifying older brother,
its pain train.

37:21.206 --> 37:24.040
[audience cheering]

37:28.880 --> 37:34.751
<i> [chris] pain train knocked out</i>
<i> by deep-6 in its season debut,</i>
<i>  there's evan arias,</i>

37:34.753 --> 37:36.886
<i>  wearing the shades,</i>
<i>  waving to the crowd.</i>

37:36.888 --> 37:39.556
<i>  That weapon looks great, man.</i>

37:39.558 --> 37:42.058
<i>  We just want to see it</i>
<i>  connect occasionally.</i>

37:42.060 --> 37:45.595
<i> [kenny] yeah, well,</i>
<i>  it was working perfectly</i>
<i> in the test box earlier today,</i>

37:45.597 --> 37:47.764
<i>  and at 75 pounds,</i>

37:47.766 --> 37:53.670
<i>  pain train's drum</i>
<i>  is more than 30, yes,</i>
<i> 30 pounds heavier than yeti's.</i>

37:53.672 --> 37:57.807
<i>  Because of that, evans says</i>
<i>  he does want to attack</i>
<i>  head on here,</i>

37:57.809 --> 38:00.277
<i>  so let's see</i>
<i>  if it can hold up tonight.</i>

38:02.414 --> 38:04.147
The yeti's been around
for a little bit.

38:04.149 --> 38:05.615
I was actually a fan
of it growing up.

38:05.617 --> 38:08.885
It has this nice seven-tooth
that I'm looking to rip
right off the weapon

38:08.887 --> 38:12.022
and I'm just going
to attack them, head on,
rip off their forks

38:12.024 --> 38:13.823
and have a few wheels
to have fun with.

38:13.825 --> 38:16.660
I'm more than confident
that I'm going to have
yeti on the heels today.

38:16.662 --> 38:17.961
Pain train has no brakes.

38:17.963 --> 38:20.030
I'm going to enjoy some
yeti spaghetti tonight.

38:20.032 --> 38:21.464
I can't win this fight
head to head.

38:21.466 --> 38:22.899
I have to keep my cool.

38:22.901 --> 38:26.036
I have to drive properly
and keep aiming
for their sides and back.

38:26.038 --> 38:27.537
Their drum is heavier
than ours.

38:27.539 --> 38:28.705
It probably spins faster.

38:28.707 --> 38:32.108
If I just throw caution
to the wind and go at them,

38:32.110 --> 38:36.346
we're going to lose this fight
and that's probably going
to be it for the season.

38:41.787 --> 38:44.287
[audience cheering]

39:01.073 --> 39:03.406
<i> [chris] let the bot battle</i>
<i>  begin.</i>

39:03.408 --> 39:07.944
<i>  Oh, oh, pain train passed</i>
<i>  out of the game, but just</i>
<i>  runs right into the rails.</i>

39:07.946 --> 39:09.412
<i> [kenny] yeah.</i>
<i>  He's trying to line it up.</i>

39:11.116 --> 39:12.916
<i>  A love tap there.</i>

39:12.918 --> 39:13.783
[loud thud]

39:13.785 --> 39:15.852
<i>  more than a a love tap there.</i>

39:15.854 --> 39:19.356
<i> [kenny] pain train doing</i>
<i>  a great job</i>
<i> of staying squared up to yeti.</i>

39:19.358 --> 39:21.958
<i> [chris] nice shot</i>
<i>  by pain train.</i>

39:21.960 --> 39:26.062
<i>  Yeti, though</i>
<i>  not taking the pain,</i>
<i>  looking for the right angle.</i>

39:26.064 --> 39:28.665
<i>  Sniffing around</i>
<i>  those tires now.</i>

39:28.667 --> 39:30.166
<i>  Dragging it out there.</i>

39:30.168 --> 39:32.035
<i> [kenny] oh, nice little flip.</i>

39:32.571 --> 39:35.939
<i>  Greg gibson driving</i>
<i>  a brilliant match so far,</i>

39:35.941 --> 39:39.242
<i>  showing a lot of patience</i>
<i>  in this opening stretch.</i>

39:40.712 --> 39:42.712
<i> [chris] big shot.</i>

39:42.714 --> 39:44.681
<i>  It's a massive drum</i>
<i>  on drum action.</i>

39:44.683 --> 39:46.750
<i>  Yeti working up a sweat now.</i>

39:46.752 --> 39:49.452
<i> [kenny] oh,</i>
<i>  this is a much better fight</i>

39:49.454 --> 39:51.955
<i>  from both yeti</i>
<i>  and pain train already.</i>

39:51.957 --> 39:55.558
<i> [chris] oh, big shot</i>
<i>  by pain train, knocks yeti...</i>

39:55.560 --> 39:58.828
[indistinct commentary]

39:58.830 --> 40:01.765
<i> [chris] oh, no, no a big part</i>
<i>  of pain train has come off.</i>

40:01.767 --> 40:04.734
<i> [kenny] yeti is about</i>
<i>  to take over,</i>
<i>  it looks like, chris.</i>

40:04.736 --> 40:07.837
<i> [chris] oh, no, pain train</i>
<i>  should motor on nicely.</i>

40:07.839 --> 40:10.807
<i> [kenny] it's exposed on</i>
<i>  the left side though.</i>

40:10.809 --> 40:12.375
<i> [chris] oh,</i>
<i>  that's got to hurt.</i>

40:12.377 --> 40:13.710
<i> [kenny] uh-oh.</i>

40:13.712 --> 40:16.746
<i> [chris] yeti flipping</i>
<i>  pain train</i>
<i>  like a pancake here.</i>

40:16.748 --> 40:18.415
<i>  Can it hang on?</i>

40:19.785 --> 40:21.584
<i>  Does pain train</i>
<i>  have any control.</i>

40:21.586 --> 40:23.620
<i> Yeti's trying to sniff it out.</i>

40:23.622 --> 40:25.688
<i>  Oh, he's grinding</i>
<i>  it into the rails.</i>

40:25.690 --> 40:27.357
<i> [kenny] un-oh, that's</i>
<i>  going to be it.</i>

40:28.660 --> 40:30.627
<i>  I don't see</i>
<i>  controlled movement.</i>

40:30.629 --> 40:32.162
<i> [chris] you saw</i>
<i>  a lot of wobbling right now</i>

40:32.164 --> 40:34.731
<i>  and pain train</i>
<i>  still might be...</i>

40:34.733 --> 40:36.099
<i> [kenny] oh, flip.</i>

40:36.101 --> 40:37.133
<i> [chris] that's it.</i>

<i>  there's battery spilled out,</i>

40:52.083 --> 40:56.653
<i>  the top armor is off</i>
<i>  and the countdown has started</i>
<i>  and yeti.</i>

40:56.655 --> 40:59.088
<i>  Evan arias,</i>
<i>  all he can do is smile,</i>

40:59.090 --> 41:02.926
<i>  because he has been done in</i>

[audience cheering]

41:14.673 --> 41:17.640
<i> [chris] kenny, you get</i>
<i>  two high energy</i>
<i>  drum spinners like this,</i>

41:17.642 --> 41:19.008
<i>  you'd never know</i>
<i>  what could happen.</i>

41:19.010 --> 41:21.511
<i> [kenny] oh, my goodness,</i>
<i>  this was an awesome fight.</i>

41:21.513 --> 41:22.579
<i>  Both robots</i>
<i>  really went for it,</i>

41:22.581 --> 41:24.214
<i>  a little bit cautious</i>
<i>  in the beginning,</i>

41:24.850 --> 41:28.952
<i>  and then all of a sudden</i>
<i>  they just started</i>
<i>  trading blows back and forth.</i>

41:28.954 --> 41:29.919
<i> [chris] I got to tell you,</i>
<i>  pain train, you know,</i>

41:29.921 --> 41:31.754
<i>  we talked about</i>
<i> at the beginning of this fight</i>

41:31.756 --> 41:33.690
<i>  that durability was going</i>
<i>  to be an issue for them</i>

41:33.692 --> 41:35.358
<i>  and things were going</i>
<i>  just fine.</i>

41:35.360 --> 41:37.460
<i>  They were exchanging</i>
<i>  blow for blow with yeti,</i>

41:37.462 --> 41:41.664
<i>  and then they ended up</i>
<i>  losing the top armor</i>
<i>  and things changed.</i>

41:41.666 --> 41:44.734
<i> [kenny] yeah, listen,</i>
<i> there were some serious energy</i>
<i>  in that battle box.</i>

41:44.736 --> 41:46.436
<i>  Both bots landed</i>
<i>  some great shots,</i>

41:46.438 --> 41:49.939
<i>  but in the end,</i>
<i>  it really did come down</i>
<i>  to the durability,</i>

41:49.941 --> 41:55.712
<i>  you see the shots from yeti</i>
<i>  just kind of tearing apart</i>
<i>  pain train little by little,</i>

41:55.714 --> 41:57.680
<i>  bot parts everywhere.</i>

41:57.682 --> 41:59.382
<i>  It was a very</i>
<i>  surgical approach</i>

41:59.384 --> 42:01.718
<i>  from greg gibson</i>
<i>  for the most part.</i>

42:01.720 --> 42:03.253
<i> [chris] and then</i>
<i>  finishing it up,</i>

42:03.255 --> 42:07.790
<i>  knocking batteries</i>
<i>  on the battle box floor</i>
<i>  and we'll call it a night.</i>

42:07.792 --> 42:10.059
[audience cheering]

42:10.595 --> 42:12.529
[chris] greg and christian,

42:12.531 --> 42:15.832
that's the way that
that machine
is supposed to run, right?

42:15.834 --> 42:18.101
Yeah. It worked out
a lot better than last time.

42:18.103 --> 42:19.269
[chris] uh-huh.

42:21.840 --> 42:24.874
Greg, could you
kind of smell it
once pain train

42:24.876 --> 42:26.442
lost its top armor
where you're like,

42:26.444 --> 42:28.845
oh, this is going to be tasty?

42:28.847 --> 42:31.681
Sort of.
The thing is their drum
is really, really nasty.

42:31.683 --> 42:32.649
It was still spinning.

42:32.651 --> 42:34.784
So as long as that
thing's going, it's scary.

42:34.786 --> 42:37.754
Greg, it seemed like
you were a cautious early on,

42:37.756 --> 42:40.189
and then it seemed
like the old yeti
kind of revealed itself.

42:40.191 --> 42:41.691
Was that the case?

42:41.693 --> 42:44.394
Well, I had kind of
promised the team I was going
to try to drive smart

42:44.396 --> 42:48.565
and not go weapon to weapon
that usually lasts
about 20 seconds.

42:48.567 --> 42:50.867
We'll have to look back
to see if I made it
to a full 20

42:50.869 --> 42:52.869
and then we started
going drum to drum.

42:52.871 --> 42:55.104
Well, congratulations
on getting that first win.

42:55.106 --> 42:56.472
Thanks very much, guys.

42:56.474 --> 42:58.975
[audience cheering]

43:03.615 --> 43:06.082
[chris] kenny, you heard it
out of the mouth
of greg gibson,

43:06.084 --> 43:08.952
sometimes you just
got to resort back
to what you know best, huh?

43:08.954 --> 43:10.386
Yeah, absolutely.

43:10.388 --> 43:12.221
You can't get too far
from who you are.

43:12.223 --> 43:16.559
<i>  But make no mistake,</i>
<i>  the first 60 seconds</i>
<i>  of that fight</i>

43:16.561 --> 43:20.830
<i>  was maybe the most</i>
<i>  strategic driving</i>
<i>  we've ever seen from greg</i>

43:20.832 --> 43:24.033
<i>  and it paid off</i>
<i>  for a much needed victory.</i>

43:25.637 --> 43:27.003
<i> [chris] after the break,</i>

43:27.739 --> 43:31.808
<i>  the devil from the deep</i>
<i>  clashes with a deadly</i>
<i>  bird of prey.</i>

43:31.810 --> 43:35.044
<i>  It's kraken versus hijinx.</i>

43:36.181 --> 43:40.016
<i>  And don't forget about</i>
<i> the main event of the evening,</i>

43:40.018 --> 43:45.622
<i>  where the legendary lock-jaw</i>
<i>  will go head to head</i>
<i>  with speed demon hypershock.</i>

43:45.624 --> 43:48.625
<i>  It's the o.G. Donald hutson</i>

43:48.627 --> 43:52.195
<i>  versus consummate showman</i>
<i>  will bales,</i>

43:52.197 --> 43:55.164
<i>  that's later tonight</i>
<i>  on battlebots.</i>

43:56.601 --> 43:58.201
[audience cheering]

44:02.941 --> 44:04.707
<i> [chris] and welcome back</i>
<i>  to las vegas,</i>

44:04.709 --> 44:08.978
<i>  where the battlebots</i>
<i>  championship qualifiers</i>
<i>  roll on.</i>

44:08.980 --> 44:11.648
<i>  At the top</i>
<i>  of the marquee tonight,</i>

44:11.650 --> 44:15.151
<i>  boy, do we have</i>
<i>  a fun matchup for you?</i>

44:15.153 --> 44:16.786
<i> The king of flash, will bales,</i>

44:16.788 --> 44:19.455
<i>  will roll hypershock</i>
<i>  into the arena</i>

44:19.457 --> 44:23.526
<i>  to face the legendary</i>
<i>  donald hutson and lock-jaw.</i>

44:23.528 --> 44:28.731
<i>  Our cameras caught</i>
<i>  the two teams sizing</i>
<i>  each other up a bit earlier.</i>

44:28.733 --> 44:32.402
How old were you
when I first
started competing?

44:32.404 --> 44:35.071
You were,
I guess you did '95, right?

44:35.073 --> 44:36.572
-'96.
-'96, I was 4.

44:36.574 --> 44:39.776
[laughing]

44:39.778 --> 44:43.880
<i> [chris] it's young hotshot</i>
<i>  versus grizzled veteran</i>
<i>  in tonight's main event,</i>

44:43.882 --> 44:49.519
<i>  so get your popcorn ready</i>
<i>  for what is sure to be</i>
<i>  an action packed fight.</i>

44:49.521 --> 44:52.555
<i>  But right now, it's a matchup</i>
<i>  between a pair of robots,</i>

44:52.557 --> 44:56.426
<i>  who both made it to the round</i>
<i>  of 32 a season ago.</i>

44:56.428 --> 44:59.996
<i>  But now,</i>
<i>  both find themselves</i>
<i>  in an 0-1 hole.</i>

44:59.998 --> 45:02.699
<i>  Kraken versus hijinx.</i>

45:02.701 --> 45:05.835
<i>  Let's start with kraken</i>
<i>  engineered by matt spurk,</i>

45:05.837 --> 45:07.804
<i>  and you just cannot</i>
<i>  kill this thing.</i>

45:07.806 --> 45:09.272
<i>  Go ask rotator,</i>

45:09.274 --> 45:12.542
<i>  because kraken</i>
<i>  lasted the distance,</i>
<i> even though it lost its teeth,</i>

45:12.544 --> 45:14.811
<i> basically the top of its head,</i>

45:14.813 --> 45:18.414
<i>  but not its ability to drive</i>
<i>  and it shows just</i>
<i>  how tough kraken is.</i>

45:18.416 --> 45:19.615
<i> [kenny] no doubt about it.</i>

45:19.651 --> 45:22.518
<i>  That really</i>
<i>  is their superpower,</i>
<i>  its unkillable,</i>

45:22.520 --> 45:23.953
and they do have
a lot of crushing force
as well.

45:23.955 --> 45:25.988
We didn't really see that
in their first fight,

45:25.990 --> 45:27.724
but they're going
to try to use it here.

45:27.726 --> 45:29.058
In the meantime,
jen herchenroeder,

45:29.060 --> 45:30.426
<i>  who's the captain of hijinx,</i>

45:30.462 --> 45:33.896
<i>  they had</i>
<i>  such high expectations</i>
<i>  coming into this season.</i>

45:33.898 --> 45:39.469
<i>  They spent the entire off</i>
<i>  season fixing what went wrong</i>
<i>  in 2020</i>

45:39.471 --> 45:41.237
<i>  and all of a sudden,</i>
<i>  they got popped</i>

45:41.239 --> 45:43.473
<i>  right in the grill</i>
<i>  by mammoth first time out,</i>

45:43.475 --> 45:46.409
<i>  a little bit</i>
<i>  of a jarring situation</i>
<i>  for hijinx.</i>

45:46.411 --> 45:48.544
<i> [kenny] for jen,</i>
<i>  she's the ultimate optimist.</i>

45:48.546 --> 45:50.346
<i>  She was really confident that</i>
<i>  she was going to come back</i>

45:50.348 --> 45:51.647
<i>  and bring</i>
<i>  the best bot possible.</i>

45:51.649 --> 45:54.784
The winner here,
I'm not going to say
they're sitting pretty,

45:54.786 --> 45:58.287
but they're going to be
in the thick of the race
to the round of 32.

45:58.289 --> 46:00.256
The loser is going
to fall to 0-2

46:00.258 --> 46:03.960
and is going to need
some serious help
to get to the postseason.

<i> [chris] kraken and matt spurk</i>
<i>  has brought his entire family</i>
<i>  with him.</i>

46:27.519 --> 46:33.689
<i> [kenny] well, you can't even</i>
<i>  tell that dragon head got</i>
<i>  screwed up last time out.</i>

46:33.691 --> 46:36.459
<i> [chris] yeah,</i>
<i>  they had to scrap the frame</i>
<i>  from the first fight,</i>

46:36.461 --> 46:38.728
<i>  it was damaged so badly,</i>

46:38.730 --> 46:41.397
<i>  and this frame</i>
<i>  is actually designed</i>
<i>  for vertical,</i>

46:41.399 --> 46:43.599
<i>  not horizontal spinners,</i>

46:43.601 --> 46:46.402
<i>  so they're already a little</i>
<i>  behind the eight ball.</i>

46:46.404 --> 46:48.471
<i>  But if matt spurk</i>
<i>  can corner hijinx</i>

46:48.473 --> 46:50.406
<i>  and prevent it</i>
<i>  from spinning up,</i>

46:50.408 --> 46:53.976
<i>  kraken is more than capable</i>
<i>  of winning this fight.</i>

47:10.595 --> 47:12.628
<i> [chris] hijinx's always</i>

<i>  The paint job is sensational,</i>

47:15.433 --> 47:19.535
<i>  the engineering</i>
<i>  needs a little working</i>
<i>  between fights one and two.</i>

47:19.537 --> 47:21.771
<i>  We'll see</i>
<i>  what jen herchenroeder</i>
<i>  and her right hand man,</i>

47:21.773 --> 47:24.540
<i>  orion beach</i>
<i>  have dialed up tonight.</i>

47:24.542 --> 47:27.109
<i> [kenny] well, what adjustment</i>
<i>  jen made to this fight</i>

47:27.111 --> 47:32.048
<i>  was to add s7</i>
<i>  tool steel teeth</i>
<i>  to that 68-pound bar.</i>

47:32.050 --> 47:33.683
<i>  S7 is a sharper metal.</i>

47:33.685 --> 47:34.851
<i>  It's better for cutting.</i>

47:34.853 --> 47:38.521
<i>  They know kraken is too tough</i>
<i>  to bludgeoned to death,</i>

47:38.523 --> 47:41.123
<i>  but if they could cut through</i>
<i>  the sea monsters head,</i>

47:41.125 --> 47:44.360
<i>  they might actually be able</i>
<i>  to get the knockout.</i>

47:44.362 --> 47:46.195
[audience cheering]

47:49.567 --> 47:52.301
the overall strategy
with kraken
is always the same.

47:52.303 --> 47:54.871
Close the distance on them
as fast as possible,

47:54.873 --> 47:56.572
light them up
and then just crush them.

47:56.574 --> 47:58.407
They've got such a long bar

47:58.409 --> 48:01.844
and it takes a long time
to get up to really
deadly speed.

48:01.846 --> 48:03.946
And I think
if we can get on them
and just stay on them,

48:03.948 --> 48:05.414
I think we'll be okay.

48:05.416 --> 48:08.084
But if we have to back off
or we get separated too much,

48:08.086 --> 48:11.621
then they're really going
to tear us up pretty bad.

48:11.623 --> 48:16.425
Matt spurk
is a fantastic builder
and made regular improvements.

48:16.427 --> 48:17.827
Kraken is fully able
to get their teeth

48:17.829 --> 48:20.963
around one of our wings
and controlled the fight.

48:20.965 --> 48:23.532
So we're going to do
everything we can
to stay out of the mouth

48:23.534 --> 48:26.602
and to knock the teeth out
as fast as we can.

48:26.604 --> 48:29.405
For both teams, this,
this is a mandatory win,

48:29.407 --> 48:31.407
something to be said
for strength schedule,

48:31.409 --> 48:34.310
you can have
really good fights
against really good robots,

48:34.312 --> 48:38.648
but I do think it's a much
larger uphill struggle

48:38.650 --> 48:42.018
to get into the round of 32
if you don't have
at least two wins.

<i> [kenny] wow!</i>

52:52.703 --> 52:55.404
<i> [chris] boy, was there</i>
<i>  a lot going on in this one,</i>
<i>  kenny.</i>

52:55.406 --> 52:59.508

<i>  Hijinx with a big shot</i>
<i>  right off the bat,</i>
<i>  kraken trying to control.</i>

53:03.748 --> 53:07.750
<i>  They just were never able</i>
<i>  to get that good</i>
<i>  fight down on hijinx.</i>

53:07.752 --> 53:09.652
<i> [chris] now,</i>
<i>  I got to give orion beach</i>

53:09.654 --> 53:12.588
<i>  a whole lot of credit</i>
<i>  for keeping hijinx active</i>

53:12.590 --> 53:17.726
<i>  and away from</i>
<i>  that bite of kraken,</i>
<i>  all while driving inverted.</i>

53:17.728 --> 53:21.931
<i> [kenny] no doubt,</i>
<i>  especially when you consider</i>
<i>  that his drive controls</i>

53:21.933 --> 53:24.400
<i>  were reversed</i>
<i>  once hijinx got flipped.</i>

53:24.402 --> 53:25.734
<i>  Great job by orion.</i>

53:25.736 --> 53:28.504
<i> [chris] man, this was</i>
<i>  a very close fight.</i>

53:28.506 --> 53:32.174
<i> So how do you think the judges</i>
<i>  will break this one down?</i>

53:32.176 --> 53:36.212
<i> [kenny] this is a tough call.</i>
<i>  To me, kraken was</i>
<i>  the more aggressive robot.</i>

53:36.214 --> 53:40.349
It should have the edge there,
and matt spurk will win
some control points

53:40.351 --> 53:42.851
<i>  for tossing hijinx</i>
<i>  onto the upper deck.</i>

53:42.853 --> 53:47.590
<i>  But in the end,</i>
<i> this could very well come down</i>
<i>  to the damage column.</i>

53:47.592 --> 53:49.925
<i>  Hijinx landed a bunch</i>
<i>  of heavy shots,</i>

53:49.927 --> 53:52.828
<i>  beat up on kraken</i>
<i>  and ripped one of</i>
<i>  its teeth out</i>

53:52.830 --> 53:55.664
<i>  advantage hijinx</i>
<i>  in that category,</i>

53:55.666 --> 53:58.767
<i>  going to be a fascinating</i>
<i>  decision either way.</i>

53:58.769 --> 54:01.103

<i>  with the results.</i>

54:24.528 --> 54:27.062
[audience cheering]

54:40.878 --> 54:46.015
jen herchenroeder,
is it fair to say that hijinx
probably doesn't win

54:46.017 --> 54:48.417
a fight like this
a season ago?

54:48.419 --> 54:51.120
I think that is probably true.

54:51.122 --> 54:54.556
We've done everything we can
to improve literally
everything on the robot.

54:54.558 --> 54:56.525
We made one mistake.

54:56.527 --> 55:00.596
We made one big mistake
in the pits before our
first fight, we fixed it.

55:00.598 --> 55:04.967
It'll never happen again,
and you're going to see more
of that from here on out.

55:04.969 --> 55:06.568
That was a back
and forth fight, jen.

55:06.570 --> 55:08.737
Yeah.

55:08.739 --> 55:12.007
At one point,
it seemed like you were stuck
there on the upper deck.

55:12.009 --> 55:12.641
Did that worry you?

55:12.643 --> 55:14.677
No.

55:14.679 --> 55:17.212
We consider that it was
a high probability
we'd be put upside down

55:17.214 --> 55:19.315
at some point
and we can drive inverted.

55:19.317 --> 55:21.884
It's not a problem,
but just to make it
a little bit easier on orion,

55:21.886 --> 55:26.955
I added some slippery uhmw
to the top of the head
to help us scoot off

55:26.957 --> 55:28.190
in the case we had
one wheel on,

55:28.192 --> 55:31.060
one wheel off some kind
of balance and he did
a great job.

55:31.062 --> 55:32.561
He sure did.

55:32.563 --> 55:34.830
Jen, congratulations.

55:34.832 --> 55:37.966
Hijinx evens its record
at 1-1 on the season.

55:57.321 --> 56:02.758
<i>  Looks like kraken did end up</i>
<i>  winning the aggression</i>
<i>  and control categories,</i>

56:02.760 --> 56:07.930
<i> but wow, the numbers that tell</i>
<i>  the story are</i>
<i>  in the damaged department.</i>

56:07.932 --> 56:10.566
<i>  You see there on jason</i>
<i>  and derek's cards,</i>

56:10.568 --> 56:14.903
<i>  both of them scoring damage</i>
<i>  4-1 in favor of hijinx.</i>

56:14.905 --> 56:18.240
<i>  Tough to win a fight</i>
<i>  if you don't come out on top</i>

56:18.242 --> 56:20.209
<i>  in the most heavily</i>
<i>  weighted category.</i>

56:20.211 --> 56:24.813
<i> [chris] destroy or disable</i>
<i>  your opponent,</i>
<i>  that is the mission.</i>

56:24.815 --> 56:29.485
<i>  So hijinx moves to 1-1,</i>
<i>  while fan favorite kraken</i>
<i>  now faces the challenge</i>

56:29.487 --> 56:32.388
<i>  of climbing out</i>
<i>  of an 0-2 hole.</i>

56:34.558 --> 56:37.559
<i>  Coming up,</i>
<i>  a showdown between</i>
<i>  two 20-year-olds,</i>

56:37.561 --> 56:40.696
<i>  and I'm not talking</i>
<i>  about a tik-tok battle.</i>

56:40.698 --> 56:44.900
<i>  Jason vasquez</i>
<i>  and his control bot defender</i>
<i>  square off</i>

56:44.902 --> 56:50.939
<i>  with ethan kurtz</i>
<i>  and the highly destructive</i>
<i>  drum spinner of riptide.</i>

56:50.941 --> 56:54.309
<i>  That's next on battlebots.</i>

56:58.883 --> 57:00.716
[audience cheering]

57:00.718 --> 57:03.752
we continue on here
<i> on battlebots and up next,</i>

57:03.754 --> 57:07.823
<i>  let's take a closer look</i>
<i>  at tonight's marquee matchup.</i>

57:07.825 --> 57:10.659
<i>  It's hypershock</i>
<i>  versus lock-jaw,</i>

57:10.661 --> 57:13.862
<i>  a main event featuring speed,</i>

57:13.864 --> 57:18.167
<i>  spinners and two</i>
<i>  of the biggest stars</i>
<i>  in this sport.</i>

57:20.571 --> 57:24.640
<i> [faruq] it's hypershock.</i>

57:24.642 --> 57:27.376
In years past,
we had great weapons,
we have great tech,

57:27.378 --> 57:30.846
we had good style
and we had good driving.

57:30.848 --> 57:35.984
<i> [kenny] that was a perfect</i>
<i>  bot crush chris, I've never</i>
<i>  seen anyone get out of this.</i>

57:36.320 --> 57:39.621
But for whatever reason,
it never quite came together.

57:39.623 --> 57:43.258
<i> [chris] I don't think</i>
<i>  there's anything hypershock</i>
<i>  can do kenny.</i>

57:45.262 --> 57:47.763
<i> [will] this year,</i>
<i>  we made a concerted effort</i>
<i>  to say, okay,</i>

57:47.765 --> 57:52.000
<i>  no more gimmicks,</i>
<i>  no more stupid little tricks,</i>
<i>  no more self-righter.</i>

57:52.002 --> 57:54.803
And in our fight
against slamo,

57:54.805 --> 57:55.437
basically everything
went right.

57:55.439 --> 57:57.406
<i> [kenny] oh!</i>

57:57.408 --> 58:01.310
<i> [chris] with that combination</i>
<i>  of speed and power slamo,</i>
<i>  doesn't stand a chance.</i>

58:01.312 --> 58:04.413
<i> [kenny] oh, what a shot</i>
<i>  by will bales.</i>

58:05.816 --> 58:09.818
We felt good,
the robot drove well,
the weapon worked great,

58:09.820 --> 58:11.386
and we've got it nailed.

58:11.388 --> 58:13.722
<i> [referee] that's a knock-out.</i>

58:13.724 --> 58:17.960
<i> [kenny] hypershock</i>
<i>  is back chris.</i>
<i>  Oh, man.</i>

58:18.896 --> 58:21.330
<i> [faruq] it's macho.</i>

58:23.901 --> 58:26.034
[donald] I have won
two championships

58:27.771 --> 58:29.371
and two's not enough.

58:30.274 --> 58:33.742
<i> [chris] oh, no mercy</i>
<i>  from lock-jaw.</i>

58:33.744 --> 58:38.881
These qualifying matches
are meant to kind of seat us
position us in a way to say

58:38.883 --> 58:40.582
we have a good chance
at a run for the nut.

58:40.584 --> 58:43.952
<i> [chris] oh, what a shot.</i>

58:43.954 --> 58:49.091
The last fight I had with
copperhead was a complete,
chaotic mess.

58:50.528 --> 58:52.794
<i> [chris] the left fork</i>
<i>  is bent backwards.</i>

58:52.796 --> 58:55.697
<i>  The left front wheel</i>
<i>  is hanging out for dear life</i>

58:55.699 --> 58:58.100
<i>  and lock-jaw is behind</i>
<i>  the eight ball now.</i>

58:58.102 --> 59:01.169
But I went all three minutes
with that beating.

59:04.975 --> 59:09.545
So that gave me just a little
bit of confidence about maybe
how I go into the next one.

59:09.547 --> 59:12.781
<i> [chris] whoa!</i>
<i>  Lock-jaw is going</i>
<i>  right at him.</i>

59:12.783 --> 59:15.784
Lock-jaw looks tough
as nails this year.
They're hard to beat.

59:15.786 --> 59:18.420
Donald has been here
since the beginning.

59:18.422 --> 59:21.123
<i> [chris] donald hutson,</i>
<i>  the legend.</i>

59:21.125 --> 59:23.358
And he's a very good driver.

59:23.360 --> 59:26.795
<i> [chris] unbelievable,</i>
<i>  the driving by donald hutson.</i>

59:26.797 --> 59:30.866
We have a good chance to win
if we can avoid
the hard impacts.

59:30.868 --> 59:33.035
That's pretty beefy weapon.

59:33.871 --> 59:37.839
<i> [chris] hypershock coated...</i>

59:37.841 --> 59:40.609
We have 25% more weapon mass
than we did before.

59:40.611 --> 59:44.546
<i>  We have 40% more weapon</i>
<i>  energy than before.</i>

59:44.548 --> 59:46.748
If we can get the weapon
to connect with lock-jaw,

59:46.750 --> 59:48.550
we're going to see some
wheels come off.

59:48.552 --> 59:51.019
<i>  We're going to see some</i>
<i>  extra holes in lock-jaw</i>

59:51.021 --> 59:52.554
<i>  that they didn't have</i>
<i>  at the beginning.</i>

59:52.556 --> 59:54.222
I want to mangle some metal.

59:54.692 --> 59:58.794
<i> [chris] will bales</i>
<i>  and his best friend chaos</i>
<i>  have entered the battle box.</i>

59:58.796 --> 1:00:01.196
It's going to be
a lot of back
and forth going on.

1:00:02.032 --> 1:00:04.833
<i>  I'm relentless.</i>
<i>  I'm not going to let up.</i>

1:00:04.835 --> 1:00:08.003
I need to win this match,
so here I come, will.

1:00:08.739 --> 1:00:12.007
<i> [chris] oh, unbelievable.</i>

1:00:12.676 --> 1:00:15.444
<i>  That one is going</i>
<i>  to be fun, kenny.</i>

1:00:15.446 --> 1:00:18.814
<i>  Now, when donald says</i>
<i>  he's won two championships,</i>

1:00:18.816 --> 1:00:20.616
<i>  he's referring to the super</i>
<i>  heavyweight titles</i>

1:00:20.618 --> 1:00:24.119
<i>  he won with his iconic</i>
<i>  robot dissector.</i>

1:00:24.121 --> 1:00:27.723
<i>  He, of course,</i>
<i>  is still looking</i>
<i>  for that elusive giant nut</i>

1:00:27.725 --> 1:00:29.992
<i>  here in the modern era.</i>

1:00:31.095 --> 1:00:32.628
<i>  But before we get you</i>
<i>  to that main event,</i>

1:00:32.630 --> 1:00:35.130
<i>  we got one more</i>
<i>  matchup for you,</i>

1:00:35.132 --> 1:00:37.366
<i>  featuring two</i>
<i>  of this season's top rookies</i>

1:00:37.368 --> 1:00:40.569
<i>  in the field,</i>
<i>  defender and riptide.</i>

1:00:40.571 --> 1:00:45.407
And let's start with riptide,
captained by a college
kid out of los angeles.

1:00:45.409 --> 1:00:49.311
<i>  Ethan kurtz, he was</i>
<i>  so excited just to be</i>
<i>  involved in battlebots.</i>

1:00:49.313 --> 1:00:51.647
<i>  Then, when he won</i>
<i>  his first match</i>

1:00:51.649 --> 1:00:55.651
<i>  against huge no less</i>
<i>  by a knockout</i>
<i>  in less than a minute,</i>

1:00:55.653 --> 1:00:58.553
<i>  the dude was basically</i>
<i>  running around here</i>
<i>  going crazy.</i>

1:00:58.555 --> 1:01:01.590
<i>  He couldn't catch his breath,</i>
<i>  guy's having the time</i>
<i>  of his life.</i>

1:01:01.592 --> 1:01:03.859
<i> [kenny] yeah,</i>
<i>  amazing performance</i>
<i>  in that first fight.</i>

1:01:03.861 --> 1:01:06.728
<i>  That weapon is devastating,</i>
<i>  so he's on his way.</i>

1:01:06.730 --> 1:01:09.665
Taking on another college kid
from the los angeles area,

1:01:09.667 --> 1:01:12.534
but the last name you
certainly know oh, so well.

1:01:12.536 --> 1:01:16.138
<i>  Jason vasquez,</i>
<i>  the younger brother</i>
<i>  of manny vasquez,</i>

1:01:16.140 --> 1:01:19.975
<i>  defender lost its opener,</i>
<i>  knocked out by ribot.</i>

1:01:19.977 --> 1:01:21.476
<i>  Jason said, listen,</i>
<i>  we worked on it.</i>

1:01:21.478 --> 1:01:23.945
<i>  My brother even came over</i>
<i>  and helped out a little bit</i>

1:01:23.947 --> 1:01:25.547
<i>  and he certainly hasn't lost</i>
<i>  any confidence.</i>

1:01:25.549 --> 1:01:27.549
<i> [kenny] no, not at all.</i>
<i>  He's been here before.</i>

1:01:27.551 --> 1:01:29.551
<i>  He has a lot of experience,</i>
<i>  of course, with whiplash,</i>

1:01:29.553 --> 1:01:32.521
<i>  and he believes he has</i>
<i>  his robot dialed in.</i>

1:01:32.523 --> 1:01:35.023
<i>  He loves this matchup</i>
<i>  against riptide as well.</i>

1:01:35.025 --> 1:01:39.194
Rookie versus rookie.
Should be a fun one. Faruq?

1:01:39.797 --> 1:01:42.464
[audience cheering]

1:01:42.466 --> 1:01:47.769
in the red square,
he's all plugged in
and turned up to 11,

1:01:47.771 --> 1:01:51.406
here to make his opponents
take the stairway to heaven

1:01:51.408 --> 1:01:53.542
like a hot guitar
solo on your face,

1:01:53.544 --> 1:01:56.945
he'll be wailing, tear you up
like a master.

1:01:56.947 --> 1:02:03.185
Call him shreddy van halen.
Crank it up for defender.

1:02:03.187 --> 1:02:06.688
[audience cheering]

1:02:06.690 --> 1:02:12.761
<i> [chris] all right, there's</i>
<i>  jason in front with his mom</i>
<i>  and pop and also rob,</i>

1:02:12.763 --> 1:02:14.162
<i>  guy that you bring</i>
<i>  in to help out,</i>

1:02:14.164 --> 1:02:18.400
<i>  he's great behind</i>
<i>  the scenes guy here,</i>
<i>  pushing in the bot.</i>

1:02:18.402 --> 1:02:21.670
<i> [kenny] rob mastic, of course,</i>
<i>  used to be on fight force.</i>

1:02:21.672 --> 1:02:25.040
<i>  Now they've gone from</i>
<i>  four forks to two</i>
<i>  on front of defender.</i>

1:02:25.042 --> 1:02:28.777
<i> Jason realized those were just</i>
<i>  going to get shredded against</i>
<i>  a vertical spinner</i>

1:02:28.779 --> 1:02:30.312
<i>  like riptide.</i>

1:02:30.848 --> 1:02:34.282
<i>  Now to win, he's going</i>
<i>  to have to smother</i>
<i>  wild driver ethan kurtz,</i>

1:02:34.284 --> 1:02:36.885
<i>  which is no easy task.</i>

1:02:36.887 --> 1:02:41.123
In the blue square,
when this riptide takes over
the battle box,

1:02:41.125 --> 1:02:42.691
no lifeguard can save you.

1:02:42.693 --> 1:02:44.459
Not even hasselhoff.

1:02:44.461 --> 1:02:48.430
No pam anderson
or carmen electra running
in slow motion,

1:02:48.432 --> 1:02:54.436
just you getting devoured
by a murderous ocean,
it's riptide.

1:02:54.438 --> 1:02:57.405
[audience cheering]

1:03:00.744 --> 1:03:04.412
<i> [chris] team riptide made up</i>
<i>  of a bunch of college</i>
<i>  and high school kids,</i>

1:03:04.414 --> 1:03:07.516
<i>  and ethan kurtz calls</i>
<i>  just a bunch of idiots.</i>

1:03:07.518 --> 1:03:10.819
<i>  But there's ethan in front.</i>
<i>  He's always having fun.</i>

1:03:10.821 --> 1:03:12.587
<i> [kenny] yeah, just kind</i>
<i>  of soaking it all in.</i>

1:03:12.589 --> 1:03:15.824
<i>  I thought this bot did</i>
<i>  a great job against huge.</i>

1:03:15.826 --> 1:03:19.027
<i> [chris] yeah.</i>
<i>  It doesn't get much better</i>
<i>  than that in its first fight.</i>

1:03:19.029 --> 1:03:20.262
<i>  It's a powerful bot,</i>

1:03:20.264 --> 1:03:23.231
<i>  and I think</i>
<i>  an underrated aspect</i>
<i>  is its wide base</i>

1:03:23.233 --> 1:03:25.634
<i>  and low center of mass.</i>

1:03:25.636 --> 1:03:29.671
<i>  This makes turning easier,</i>
<i>  which is going to be crucial</i>
<i>  against an opponent</i>

1:03:29.673 --> 1:03:32.974
<i>  that they want to avoid</i>
<i>  approaching face first.</i>

1:03:40.784 --> 1:03:42.784
Riptide's got a huge weapon,
and I mean,

1:03:42.786 --> 1:03:44.753
that's something
to always be concerned about.

1:03:44.755 --> 1:03:47.689
Ribot, they destroyed
our switches

1:03:47.691 --> 1:03:50.425
and we realized from that
that our electronics

1:03:50.427 --> 1:03:51.793
placement could
have been better.

1:03:51.795 --> 1:03:53.261
By moving around some
of the electronics,

1:03:53.263 --> 1:03:56.264
we really don't think
they're going to be able
to kill our drive.

1:03:56.266 --> 1:04:00.502
So if we could drive that
full three minutes and stay
aggressive and persistent,

1:04:00.504 --> 1:04:04.072
I think we could definitely
take the judge's decision,
if not a knockout.

1:04:04.074 --> 1:04:07.943
Our strategy for defender's
to approach them
at a slight angle

1:04:07.945 --> 1:04:09.144
and try to bite
into their ports

1:04:09.146 --> 1:04:12.380
or whatever we can
and get our weapon bar dig
into them.

1:04:12.382 --> 1:04:14.649
We need one hit on defender
to win the fight.

1:04:14.651 --> 1:04:17.419
As soon as we get one hit,
which pound them
and pound them

1:04:17.421 --> 1:04:19.554
and pound them
and pound them and it's over.

1:04:19.556 --> 1:04:22.858
We showed last fight
that we had the power
to knock anyone out.

1:04:22.860 --> 1:04:26.394
Doesn't matter who you are,
even if you're huge,
we knock you out.

1:04:26.396 --> 1:04:29.197
So now we just have
to sustain that.

1:04:31.001 --> 1:04:32.734
[robotic voice]
<i>  robots activate.</i>

<i> [chris] once again,</i>
<i>  both of these captains</i>
<i>  are only 20 years old.</i>

1:04:39.643 --> 1:04:43.411
<i>  We are looking at the future</i>
<i>  of this sport folks.</i>

1:04:45.048 --> 1:04:49.150
<i>  Can riptide start</i>
<i>  their battle box career 2-0?</i>

1:04:49.152 --> 1:04:53.221
<i>  Or will jason vasquez</i>
<i>  get his first win as</i>
<i>  captain of defender?</i>

1:04:53.223 --> 1:04:57.125
<i>  Find out when battlebots</i>
<i>  continues.</i>

<i> [chris] welcome back</i>
<i>  to battlebots,</i>

1:05:07.137 --> 1:05:09.905
<i>  where two rookie teams</i>
<i>  are inside the box</i>

1:05:09.907 --> 1:05:12.941
<i>  and ready to tear each other</i>
<i>  into pieces.</i>

1:05:13.777 --> 1:05:18.213
<i>  Its defender versus</i>

1:05:42.739 --> 1:05:44.773
<i> [chris] let the bot battle</i>
<i>  begin.</i>

1:05:44.775 --> 1:05:47.342
<i>  Oh, defender with a nice pop</i>
<i>  to riptide and...</i>

<i>  Running side.</i>

<i> [kenny] oh!</i>

1:05:51.348 --> 1:05:52.881
<i> [chris] ripped off</i>
<i>  another piece</i>
<i>  and then just...</i>

1:05:52.883 --> 1:05:56.785
<i>  Riptide cannot get over</i>
<i>  and can get defender</i>
<i>  get back off its butt?</i>

1:05:56.787 --> 1:05:59.387
<i> [kenny] defender went</i>
<i>  right at it, oh...</i>

1:05:59.389 --> 1:06:01.456
<i> The primary weapon of riptide.</i>

1:06:01.458 --> 1:06:03.158
<i> [chris] now,</i>
<i>  this is amazing kenny.</i>

1:06:03.160 --> 1:06:06.428
<i>  Riptide popped itself back</i>
<i>  over by hitting the rails,</i>

1:06:06.430 --> 1:06:07.729
<i>  but landed perfectly</i>
<i>  on its side.</i>

1:06:07.731 --> 1:06:10.565
[man] let's go.

1:06:10.567 --> 1:06:14.402
<i> [chris] let's see</i>
<i>  if defender lends a helping</i>
<i>  hand or just takes the win.</i>

1:06:15.906 --> 1:06:16.871
<i> [kenny] and there's</i>
<i>  your answer.</i>

1:06:16.873 --> 1:06:20.008
<i>  Jason vasquez tips</i>
<i>  riptide onto his head.</i>

1:06:20.010 --> 1:06:21.676
<i>  He wants to keep</i>
<i>  the fight going.</i>

1:06:21.678 --> 1:06:26.414
<i>  Let's see if riptide can</i>
<i>  right itself again here.</i>

1:06:26.416 --> 1:06:28.316
<i> [chris] see if defender</i>
<i>  can get a hold of him</i>
<i>  that's been able</i>

1:06:28.318 --> 1:06:31.052
<i>  to get that grabber</i>
<i>  going quite yet.</i>

1:06:31.054 --> 1:06:34.022
<i> [kenny] anytime riptide's</i>
<i>  trying to bounce itself</i>
<i>  off of the...</i>

1:06:35.125 --> 1:06:36.624
<i>  Oh!</i>

1:06:36.626 --> 1:06:37.592
<i>  Holy smokes.</i>

1:06:37.594 --> 1:06:38.960
<i> [chris] that's one way</i>
<i>  to do it.</i>

1:06:39.796 --> 1:06:41.763
<i>  And now he's trying</i>
<i>  to back off</i>
<i>  and here comes defender.</i>

1:06:41.765 --> 1:06:43.598
<i> [kenny] oh, boy!</i>

1:06:43.600 --> 1:06:46.801
<i> [chris] get right on</i>
<i>  and that was awesome.</i>

1:06:46.803 --> 1:06:48.670
<i> [kenny] that was</i>
<i>  tremendous driving</i>

1:06:48.672 --> 1:06:51.406
<i>  from both drivers there.</i>

1:06:51.408 --> 1:06:52.874
<i> [chris] remember,</i>
<i>  these are a couple</i>
<i>  of college kids</i>

1:06:52.876 --> 1:06:54.576
<i>  out of los angeles,</i>

1:06:54.578 --> 1:06:57.712
<i>  not a lot of stick time</i>
<i>  for either on these bots.</i>

1:06:57.714 --> 1:06:59.547
<i> [kenny] nice driving</i>
<i>  by jason vasquez,</i>

1:06:59.549 --> 1:07:02.283
<i>  keeping the pressure</i>
<i>  on riptide.</i>

1:07:02.285 --> 1:07:06.788
<i> [chris] oh, nice work on</i>
<i>  pulverizer, just a neck...</i>
<i>  Defender.</i>

1:07:06.790 --> 1:07:09.591
<i> [kenny] defender has</i>
<i>  been the lower bot</i>
<i>  so far, chris,</i>

1:07:09.593 --> 1:07:11.993
<i>  able to get underneath</i>
<i>  riptide.</i>

1:07:11.995 --> 1:07:14.562
<i> [chris] and it looks like</i>
<i>  riptide's primary weapon</i>

1:07:14.564 --> 1:07:18.233
<i>  may be slowing</i>
<i>  down now, kenny.</i>

1:07:18.235 --> 1:07:21.569
<i> [kenny] yeah.</i>
<i>  They are not able</i>
<i>  to get it up to full speed.</i>

1:07:21.571 --> 1:07:25.240
<i>  I think they damage it</i>
<i>  on that moon shot</i>
<i>  onto the upper deck.</i>

1:07:25.842 --> 1:07:28.243
<i> [chris] here's defender</i>
<i>  giving riptide</i>

1:07:28.245 --> 1:07:29.911
<i>  a nice little tour</i>
<i>  of the battle box,</i>

1:07:29.913 --> 1:07:34.215
<i>  now with no fear</i>
<i>  that dangerous</i>
<i>  egg beater weapon at all.</i>

1:07:34.918 --> 1:07:36.551
<i> [kenny] let's see</i>
<i>  if riptide can find a way</i>

1:07:36.553 --> 1:07:39.421
<i>  to even the score cards</i>
<i>  here, chris.</i>

1:07:39.423 --> 1:07:42.991
<i>  Defender looks like it may</i>
<i> be dealing with a drive issue.</i>

1:07:43.393 --> 1:07:44.726
<i> [chris] big question,</i>

1:07:44.728 --> 1:07:47.262
<i>  can these bots hang on</i>
<i>  and make it</i>
<i>  to the closing bell?</i>

1:07:47.264 --> 1:07:49.864
Get on him, get on him...

1:07:49.866 --> 1:07:51.800
<i> [kenny] and it looks</i>
<i>  like riptide starting</i>
<i>  to smoke right now, chris.</i>

1:07:51.802 --> 1:07:53.835
<i> [chris] absolutely, it is.</i>

1:07:53.837 --> 1:07:56.404
<i>  Primary weapon</i>
<i>  not working on either robot.</i>

1:07:56.406 --> 1:07:58.673
<i>  It is a driving competition.</i>

1:07:58.675 --> 1:08:00.608
<i>  Just about 20 seconds</i>
<i>  left to go.</i>

1:08:00.610 --> 1:08:03.678
<i>  Defender with a pin</i>
<i>  in the corner.</i>

1:08:03.680 --> 1:08:06.514
<i> [kenny] trying to get</i>
<i>  a lift going,</i>
<i>  not quite able to do it.</i>

1:08:06.516 --> 1:08:10.685
<i> [chris] have to let riptide go</i>
<i>  and does.</i>

1:08:10.687 --> 1:08:15.790
<i>  Smart play by jason vasquez,</i>
<i>  leaning on riptide</i>
<i>  like a boxer there,</i>

1:08:15.792 --> 1:08:18.893
<i>  as defender is now just crab</i>
<i>  walking around the box.</i>

1:08:18.895 --> 1:08:20.462
[audience cheering]

1:08:20.464 --> 1:08:23.398
<i> [chris] and there</i>
<i>  is the closing bell,</i>

1:08:23.400 --> 1:08:27.001
<i>  which means</i>
<i>  we will be going</i>
<i>  to the scorecards.</i>

1:08:27.904 --> 1:08:31.372
<i>  The judges are earning</i>
<i>  their paychecks tonight.</i>

1:08:33.610 --> 1:08:35.743
<i>  Kenny, riptide has</i>
<i>  a scary weapon,</i>

1:08:35.745 --> 1:08:38.847
<i>  but jason vasquez</i>
<i>  showed no fear.</i>

1:08:38.849 --> 1:08:42.383
<i>  He came out in all</i>
<i>  out attack mode.</i>

1:08:42.385 --> 1:08:45.753
<i> [kenny] yeah, defender went</i>
<i>  right at that primary weapon</i>

1:08:45.755 --> 1:08:49.424
<i>  and had team riptide on</i>
<i>  the ropes early.</i>

1:08:49.426 --> 1:08:52.093
<i>  But how about this move,</i>

1:08:52.095 --> 1:08:56.631
<i>  riptide launching themselves</i>
<i>  15 feet into the air</i>

1:08:56.633 --> 1:08:58.600
<i>  and onto the upper deck?</i>

1:08:58.602 --> 1:09:00.001
<i>  That's one way to self-right.</i>

1:09:00.003 --> 1:09:01.836
<i>  I mean, look how</i>
<i>  high they were.</i>

1:09:01.838 --> 1:09:04.939
<i>  That was insane.</i>
<i>  Craziness.</i>

1:09:04.941 --> 1:09:07.942
<i> [chris] both teams weapons</i>
<i>  eventually went down,</i>

1:09:07.944 --> 1:09:09.611
<i>  but as the control</i>
<i>  bot, defender</i>

1:09:09.613 --> 1:09:12.981
<i>  was better set up</i>
<i>  to take advantage.</i>

1:09:13.750 --> 1:09:16.151
<i> [kenny] exactly. Defender</i>
<i>  stayed aggressive,</i>

1:09:16.153 --> 1:09:17.485
<i>  it was the lower bot</i>
<i>  in this match,</i>

1:09:17.487 --> 1:09:20.788
<i>  which allowed it</i>
<i>  to get underneath riptide</i>

1:09:20.790 --> 1:09:25.860
<i>  and control the action,</i>
<i>  that should pay dividends</i>
<i>  on the scorecards.</i>

1:09:25.862 --> 1:09:29.063
<i> [chris] here's our man, faruq,</i>
<i>  with the results.</i>

1:09:30.600 --> 1:09:33.301
The results from
the judges are in.

1:09:38.041 --> 1:09:42.043
The winner by unanimous
decision is...

1:09:45.081 --> 1:09:46.881
Defender.

1:09:46.883 --> 1:09:49.083
[audience cheering]

1:09:58.128 --> 1:10:01.196
<i> [chris] all right, jason.</i>

1:10:01.198 --> 1:10:05.200
I don't know what was tougher,
getting that first win
as a captain or rob masek hug?

1:10:05.202 --> 1:10:06.401
Are you, did he break
a rib there?

1:10:06.403 --> 1:10:07.468
You okay?

1:10:07.470 --> 1:10:09.404
Yeah, no, I'm really excited
about that.

1:10:09.406 --> 1:10:11.072
I was pretty concerned
after knocking them back down,

1:10:11.074 --> 1:10:13.107
but I just wanted the fight
to keep going.

1:10:13.109 --> 1:10:14.442
But I mean, I'm happy I won.

1:10:14.444 --> 1:10:16.110
It was a pretty good,
close fight, so.

1:10:16.112 --> 1:10:19.314
Your first win here
<i> at battlebots, man,</i>
<i> how does that feel?</i>

1:10:19.316 --> 1:10:20.882
It feels really good.

1:10:20.884 --> 1:10:23.418
It feels so weird,
I feel like I've won
a thousand times at whiplash.

1:10:23.420 --> 1:10:24.986
But I guess this
is the real deal,

1:10:24.988 --> 1:10:29.123
this nobody could say
I didn't win,
so I'm pretty happy with that.

1:10:30.994 --> 1:10:33.394
Is your brother around there
or did you just have to go

1:10:33.396 --> 1:10:34.862
brag in his face now
that you got one?

1:10:34.864 --> 1:10:36.764
Oh, no.

1:10:36.766 --> 1:10:38.600
No, no, there are no hard
feelings between us.

1:10:38.602 --> 1:10:39.901
He's... He's kind
of in the shadows

1:10:39.903 --> 1:10:42.170
around here just kind
of helping me out,

1:10:42.172 --> 1:10:43.504
giving me good vibes
before the fight, so.

1:10:43.506 --> 1:10:44.939
Good deal.

1:10:44.941 --> 1:10:47.775
Well, congratulations
on getting your first win
as a team captain.

1:10:47.777 --> 1:10:48.743
-That's awesome, dude.
-[jason] thank you.

1:10:48.745 --> 1:10:51.212
[audience cheering]

1:10:54.551 --> 1:10:57.952
you know,
it's so interesting
jason vasquez has

1:10:57.954 --> 1:11:00.355
been a part of a team
that made it all the way
to the final a year ago,

1:11:00.357 --> 1:11:03.691
but, man, when you move up
a chair and it's your bot,

1:11:03.693 --> 1:11:05.793
you're making the decisions,
just getting
that first victory,

1:11:05.795 --> 1:11:06.728
it's got to feel great.

1:11:06.730 --> 1:11:07.662
<i> [kenny] it's totally</i>
<i>  different.</i>

1:11:07.664 --> 1:11:09.497
<i>  Listen, both these teams</i>
<i>  were young,</i>

1:11:09.499 --> 1:11:13.301
<i>  but, you know, to captain up</i>
<i>  your first squad is not easy.</i>

1:11:13.303 --> 1:11:15.136
<i>  There's so many more</i>
<i>  responsibilities.</i>

1:11:15.138 --> 1:11:19.040
I thought he did a great job,
by not only doing that,
but also driving as well.

1:11:19.042 --> 1:11:21.876
Yeah, both these teams are
certainly the future
<i> of battlebots and right now,</i>

1:11:21.878 --> 1:11:23.978
<i>  they are each 1-1.</i>

1:11:23.980 --> 1:11:25.913
<i>  All right, stay tuned</i>
<i>  because coming up,</i>

1:11:25.915 --> 1:11:27.582
<i>  we've got the battle</i>
<i>  of the beaches,</i>

1:11:27.584 --> 1:11:29.817
<i>  as miami's own</i>
<i>  hypershock tries</i>

1:11:29.819 --> 1:11:32.754
<i>  to kick sand in the face</i>
<i>  of san diego's lock-jaw.</i>

1:11:32.756 --> 1:11:34.589
<i>  It's the main event,</i>

1:11:34.591 --> 1:11:38.059
<i>  when we come back</i>
<i>  on battlebots.</i>

1:11:40.697 --> 1:11:44.065
<i> [donald] I've been fighting</i>
<i>  robots close to 25 years.</i>

1:11:44.067 --> 1:11:45.600
Everybody always looks
<i> at battlebots,</i>

1:11:45.602 --> 1:11:47.568
it's like, "oh, it's cool,
you're on the tv show."

1:11:47.570 --> 1:11:49.871
<i>  it takes a little time</i>
<i>  for them to get to,</i>

1:11:49.873 --> 1:11:52.040
<i>  you know,</i>
<i>  how'd you get into it?</i>

1:11:52.709 --> 1:11:53.841
<i>  I tell them all</i>
<i>  the same thing,</i>

1:11:53.843 --> 1:11:56.811
<i>  I started out building</i>
<i>  remote control planes</i>

1:11:56.813 --> 1:11:58.446
<i>  and gliders just</i>
<i>  like every other kid</i>

1:11:58.448 --> 1:12:00.315
<i>  that was a little different.</i>

1:12:00.884 --> 1:12:06.154
<i>  But really, we're just hungry</i>
<i>  or more complicated things</i>
<i>  to work on than regular kids.</i>

1:12:06.156 --> 1:12:09.757
<i>  Finding something</i>
<i>  you're passionate about</i>
<i> is important for your success.</i>

1:12:09.759 --> 1:12:13.161
<i>  And the only way to do</i>
<i>  that is introduce yourself</i>
<i>  to new technologies.</i>

1:12:13.163 --> 1:12:15.063
<i>  And I think battlebots</i>
<i>  does that.</i>

1:12:15.065 --> 1:12:15.630
<i>  Thing about battlebots,</i>

1:12:15.632 --> 1:12:17.198
<i>  it's been good for me</i>

1:12:17.600 --> 1:12:21.636
<i>  and my career all the way</i>
<i>  from day-one of just building</i>
<i>  garage robots,</i>

1:12:21.638 --> 1:12:25.740
I now have my
own company building
sophisticated drones,

1:12:25.742 --> 1:12:29.544
<i>  because what I was doing</i>
<i>  in my spare time</i>
<i>  just rolled into it.</i>

1:12:29.546 --> 1:12:30.812
That's what I think is great.

1:12:30.814 --> 1:12:35.116
All the skills you learn here,
including losing and winning,

1:12:35.118 --> 1:12:38.252
are keys to your success
in the outside world.

1:12:43.660 --> 1:12:44.792
[audience cheering]

1:12:44.794 --> 1:12:46.627
[chris] we are back on
<i>  battlebots, and boy,</i>

1:12:46.629 --> 1:12:48.863
do we have a good one cooking
for you right now.

1:12:48.865 --> 1:12:51.566
Let's start with lock-jaw,
which is 0-1 on the season,

1:12:51.568 --> 1:12:53.868
<i>  it lost a decision</i>
<i>  to copperhead</i>

1:12:53.870 --> 1:12:57.071
<i>  in a fight that lock-jaw</i>
<i>  captain donald hutson said,</i>

1:12:57.073 --> 1:12:58.406
<i>  we got thrown</i>
<i>  all over the box.</i>

1:12:58.408 --> 1:13:01.075
<i>  I mean,</i>
<i>  they really took it to us.</i>

1:13:01.077 --> 1:13:02.310
How does he rebound tonight?

1:13:02.312 --> 1:13:03.845
Well, when we talked to him,
he said,

1:13:03.847 --> 1:13:06.614
<i>  you know,</i>
<i>  this really had nothing to do</i>
<i>  with the bot itself.</i>

1:13:06.616 --> 1:13:09.016
<i>  It came down to me making</i>
<i>  mistakes out there.</i>

1:13:09.018 --> 1:13:10.451
<i>  Copperhead</i>
<i>  just fought better,</i>

1:13:10.453 --> 1:13:13.721
<i> he says, I just need to go out</i>
<i> there and outdrive will bales.</i>

1:13:13.723 --> 1:13:17.558
Now taking on one
of the most popular robots
around there,

1:13:17.560 --> 1:13:20.395
<i>  hypershock,</i>
<i>  you just mentioned</i>
<i>  about will bales.</i>

1:13:20.397 --> 1:13:21.963
<i>  I talked to will before</i>
<i>  the fight,</i>

1:13:21.965 --> 1:13:25.733
<i>  and he said, listen,</i>
<i>  donald is one of the reasons</i>
<i>  I got into this.</i>

1:13:25.735 --> 1:13:27.335
I got a happy
meal lock-jaw toy,

1:13:27.337 --> 1:13:29.837
when I was a little kid,

1:13:29.839 --> 1:13:33.941
and he is certainly happy
with the way that hypershock
has run so far this season.

1:13:33.943 --> 1:13:34.876
<i> [kenny] yeah, that's right</i>
<i>  and it's amazing.</i>

1:13:34.878 --> 1:13:36.677
<i>  These guys haven't</i>
<i>  fought each other,</i>

1:13:36.679 --> 1:13:40.615
<i>  but he feels he has</i>
<i>  a speed advantage here</i>
<i>  against lock-jaw.</i>

1:13:40.617 --> 1:13:42.717
<i>  Lock-jaw might have</i>
<i>  a better turning radius.</i>

1:13:42.719 --> 1:13:44.285
<i>  They can turn</i>
<i>  a little bit better.</i>

1:13:44.687 --> 1:13:46.220
<i>  I'm fascinated</i>
<i>  with this fight.</i>

1:13:46.222 --> 1:13:48.423
<i>  Two very similar</i>
<i>  platforms here. Can't wait.</i>

1:13:50.326 --> 1:13:54.128
Are you telling
me that will bale's robot
can improve to 2-0.

1:13:54.130 --> 1:13:58.065
Don't tell will, he's going
to get all crazy on us now.
Here we go.

1:13:58.067 --> 1:14:01.803
It's the first ever meeting
between hypershock
and lock-jaw.

1:14:01.805 --> 1:14:02.904
Faruq, take it away.

1:14:02.906 --> 1:14:05.306
[audience cheering]

1:14:07.877 --> 1:14:11.879
[faruq] ladies and gentlemen,
are you ready?

1:14:11.881 --> 1:14:14.182
[audience cheering]

1:14:18.054 --> 1:14:23.090
it's time for the main event.

1:14:23.092 --> 1:14:26.027
[audience cheering]

1:14:35.371 --> 1:14:36.971
[faruq] in the red square,

1:14:36.973 --> 1:14:38.973
matching raw combat power

1:14:38.975 --> 1:14:40.908
with some flair
and some grace.

1:14:40.910 --> 1:14:44.579
Call this robot rupaul
because, honey,
he'll beat your face,

1:14:44.581 --> 1:14:46.614
he'll drag you for filth,

1:14:46.616 --> 1:14:50.885
but he ain't wearing mascara
serving you carnage,
unstoppability,

1:14:50.887 --> 1:14:55.156
nightmares and terror,
sashay shante.

1:14:55.158 --> 1:14:57.225
It's hypershock.

<i>  leading the troops out.</i>

1:15:10.807 --> 1:15:13.241
<i>  Oh, there's the will bales,</i>

1:15:14.377 --> 1:15:15.843
<i> [kenny] that's great.</i>

1:15:15.845 --> 1:15:18.479
<i>  But as will said, they've</i>
<i>  removed the self-righter</i>

1:15:18.481 --> 1:15:20.414
<i>  and the way they save there,</i>

1:15:20.416 --> 1:15:23.084
<i>  they put into the weapons,</i>
<i>  so those are thicker,</i>

1:15:23.086 --> 1:15:27.955
<i>  more powerful s7 tool</i>
<i>  steel blades sharp enough</i>
<i>  to cut,</i>

1:15:27.957 --> 1:15:30.124

1:15:31.528 --> 1:15:33.594
[faruq] in the blue square,

1:15:33.596 --> 1:15:36.797
a mandibular murderer
is running loose
on the streets,

1:15:36.799 --> 1:15:39.734
jack the ripper,
ted bundy and dahmer agree

1:15:39.736 --> 1:15:43.137
you need the jaws of life
to escape death
from its teeth.

1:15:43.139 --> 1:15:47.041
You don't mess with lock-jaw
if you don't have the key.

1:15:47.043 --> 1:15:49.210
It's lock-jaw.

<i> [chris] donald hutson,</i>
<i>  one of the most popular</i>

<i>  but he is always pointing</i>
<i>  to his machine</i>
<i>  at his crew for the credit.</i>

1:16:05.028 --> 1:16:07.828
<i> [kenny] yeah, very humble guy,</i>
<i>  excellent driver.</i>

1:16:07.830 --> 1:16:11.399
<i>  And donald knows hypershock</i>
<i>  doesn't have a self-righter</i>
<i>  any more,</i>

1:16:11.401 --> 1:16:13.668
<i>  so he wants to pin them</i>
<i>  into a wall</i>

1:16:13.670 --> 1:16:16.671
<i>  and then flip wheel</i>
<i>  on his back now,</i>

1:16:16.673 --> 1:16:18.973
<i>  lock-jaw doesn't</i>
<i>  have his self-righter either,</i>

1:16:18.975 --> 1:16:21.075
<i>  but it can drive</i>
<i>  fully inverted,</i>

1:16:21.077 --> 1:16:23.044
<i>  so a little more versatile.</i>

1:16:25.982 --> 1:16:28.182
[audience cheering]

1:16:32.622 --> 1:16:36.657
<i> [chris] for more on this</i>
<i> esthetically pleasing matchup,</i>
<i> we bring in our bot whisperer,</i>

<i>  pete, who has more</i>
<i>  on will bale's bot.</i>

1:16:39.529 --> 1:16:43.631
<i> [pete] so having</i>
<i>  a conversation</i>
<i>  with will before this fight,</i>

1:16:43.633 --> 1:16:46.100
<i>  they've been studying</i>
<i> for this one pretty intensely.</i>

1:16:46.102 --> 1:16:47.969
They know donald
is a great driver,

1:16:47.971 --> 1:16:51.739
but one of the things
they've noticed is that
lock-jaw tends to oversteer.

1:16:51.741 --> 1:16:54.008
So what we are going
to probably see

1:16:54.010 --> 1:16:57.945
from hypershock
is quite a lot of drifting
with these tires,

1:16:57.947 --> 1:17:00.748
as they spin around
the outside of lock-jaw,

1:17:00.750 --> 1:17:05.920
circling in like a thresher
shark coming in on its prey
to come hidden from the side.

1:17:05.922 --> 1:17:07.855
<i> [chris] you have</i>
<i>  a favorite in this one?</i>

1:17:07.857 --> 1:17:08.889
<i> [pete] hypershock.</i>

1:17:08.891 --> 1:17:11.025
[chris] oh, okay.

1:17:11.027 --> 1:17:13.094
The bot whisperer is smoking.

1:17:13.096 --> 1:17:15.262
We'll keep it quiet,
we won't tell donald.

<i> -[chris] yeah.</i>

1:18:37.480 --> 1:18:40.047
<i>  Will bales' hypershock</i>
<i>  got little airtime there</i>

1:18:51.761 --> 1:18:54.729
<i> [kenny] yeah. And hypershock</i>

1:18:54.731 --> 1:18:58.099
[chris]
<i>  I'm impressed by hypershock.</i>

1:18:58.968 --> 1:19:00.735
<i>  Even with a bummed wheel...</i>

1:19:00.737 --> 1:19:02.002
<i> [kenny] uh-oh.</i>

1:19:02.004 --> 1:19:03.337
[chris] ...A few of 'em,

1:19:03.706 --> 1:19:05.272
<i>  Whoa!</i>

1:19:09.812 --> 1:19:11.912
<i>  That was hypershock's</i>
<i>  wheel again.</i>

1:19:11.914 --> 1:19:13.214
<i>  Lock-jaw...</i>

1:19:13.216 --> 1:19:14.882
<i> [kenny] yeah.</i>
<i>  Lock-jaw...</i>

<i>  Whoa!</i>

1:19:22.091 --> 1:19:23.424
<i> Nice work by hypershock there.</i>

1:19:23.426 --> 1:19:26.193
<i>  Lock-jaw in the corner</i>

1:19:26.195 --> 1:19:30.831
<i>  Hypershock, oh,</i>
<i>  are you kidding me?</i>

1:19:30.833 --> 1:19:32.566
And that's going to be it.

1:19:32.568 --> 1:19:36.704
What a fight.
He knocked him
out of the arena.

1:19:36.706 --> 1:19:40.307
-[chris]
<i>  will bales is shocked,</i>
<i> -...Eight, seven, six,</i>

1:19:40.309 --> 1:19:43.177
[chris]
<i>  ...Because the countdown</i>
<i>  has started.</i>

1:19:43.179 --> 1:19:48.349
<i>  That is indeed going</i>
<i>  to be a knock-out in favor</i>
<i>  of hypershock.</i>

1:19:48.351 --> 1:19:51.152
[audience cheering]

1:19:57.860 --> 1:20:04.265
<i> [chris] an unbelievable</i>
<i>  first ever meeting between</i>
<i>  hypershock and lock-jaw.</i>

1:20:09.272 --> 1:20:11.906
<i>  Kenny, this was</i>
<i>  non-stop action.</i>

1:20:11.908 --> 1:20:16.277
<i> [kenny] yeah, it really was,</i>
<i>  I mean, a ton of</i>
<i>  weapon on weapon hits,</i>

1:20:16.279 --> 1:20:19.280
<i>  both these guys really</i>
<i>  going for it.</i>

1:20:19.282 --> 1:20:21.749
<i>  You see the wheels</i>
<i>  come off pretty early</i>
<i>  there for hypershock.</i>

1:20:21.751 --> 1:20:23.150
<i>  He was having issues there.</i>

1:20:23.152 --> 1:20:24.285
<i>  Peter, if you have</i>
<i>  the extra wheel,</i>

1:20:24.287 --> 1:20:26.387
<i>  you might want</i>
<i>  to give that to will.</i>

1:20:26.389 --> 1:20:30.524
<i>  But it was amazing that</i>
<i>  hypershock still had</i>
<i>  that much power,</i>

1:20:30.526 --> 1:20:33.961
<i>  even with its two front tires</i>
<i>  basically incapacitated.</i>

1:20:33.963 --> 1:20:35.963
<i> [chris] you see tires</i>
<i>  flying everywhere.</i>

1:20:35.965 --> 1:20:37.498
<i>  They are still fighting.</i>

1:20:37.500 --> 1:20:38.899
<i>  I mean, that was crazy.</i>

1:20:38.901 --> 1:20:42.403
You know, in a nascar race,
if that happens,
you call their pit crew.

1:20:42.405 --> 1:20:44.605
<i>  You cannot do that inside</i>
<i>  of the battle box</i>

1:20:44.607 --> 1:20:46.907
<i>  and look at the crowning blow</i>
<i>  to finish it off</i>

1:20:46.909 --> 1:20:49.977
<i>  as donald hutson's</i>
<i>  lock-jaw flies</i>

1:20:49.979 --> 1:20:53.981
<i>  several feet behind</i>
<i>  the barrier for the ko.</i>

1:20:54.717 --> 1:20:55.883
Thank you.

1:20:55.885 --> 1:20:56.584
[audience cheering]

1:20:56.586 --> 1:20:58.652
<i> [chris] will bales.</i>

1:20:58.654 --> 1:21:03.924
Hey, will, explain to us
how you won to fight
with your tires all chewed up.

1:21:03.926 --> 1:21:04.758
Apparently,
we don't need most of them.

1:21:04.760 --> 1:21:06.694
[laughing]

1:21:06.696 --> 1:21:09.997
um, donald can have 'em back.
The robot drives really well.

1:21:09.999 --> 1:21:12.933
Two seasons ago, we managed
most of the fight against

1:21:12.935 --> 1:21:13.667
bite force
with one wheel left,

1:21:13.669 --> 1:21:16.770
so it tracks really well.

1:21:16.772 --> 1:21:19.707
I've luckily gotten enough
driving practice
with the last version

1:21:19.709 --> 1:21:22.409
to be able to kind
of just scoot around

1:21:22.411 --> 1:21:24.979
and we're just happy
that everything worked
the whole time.

1:21:24.981 --> 1:21:26.814
It's a miracle.

1:21:26.816 --> 1:21:30.718
Will, you went
against donald hutson,
a legend of the game.

1:21:30.720 --> 1:21:32.953
What has he meant
to your career?

1:21:33.789 --> 1:21:37.191
Donald, when I was a kid,

1:21:37.193 --> 1:21:38.726
donald was the guy
who kept winning

1:21:38.728 --> 1:21:42.029
and we all looked up to,
like you said, I had his --

1:21:42.565 --> 1:21:45.199
I had his happy meal toy,
I had his rc toy,

1:21:45.201 --> 1:21:47.768
I had everything dissector
or taz-bot.

1:21:47.770 --> 1:21:49.703
It was-- they were
the coolest robots to me.

1:21:49.705 --> 1:21:53.807
So when I grew up,
I wanted to build robots
as cool as his.

1:21:53.809 --> 1:21:56.744
So to be able to fight him
at all is a dream come true.

1:21:56.746 --> 1:21:59.146
To be able to win is a fluke.

1:22:00.216 --> 1:22:01.849
That I will take,
and you can't have it back.

1:22:01.851 --> 1:22:03.817
[laughs]

1:22:03.819 --> 1:22:06.720
will, congratulations
on your 2-0 start.

1:22:06.722 --> 1:22:07.988
Thanks, guys. Appreciate it.

1:22:07.990 --> 1:22:10.124
[audience cheering]

1:22:14.163 --> 1:22:15.296
thank you.

1:22:16.065 --> 1:22:17.331
You're the best.

1:22:19.602 --> 1:22:23.637
Year after year,
we joke with will bales,
one thing falls apart,

1:22:23.639 --> 1:22:26.907
and all of a sudden
his robot dies
on the floor there.

1:22:26.909 --> 1:22:29.977
I mean, how happy
do you think that team is?

1:22:29.979 --> 1:22:31.578
I mean, they've got
to be elated.

1:22:31.580 --> 1:22:33.580
<i>  This is the best</i>
<i>  they have ever looked.</i>

1:22:33.582 --> 1:22:36.717
<i>  I mean, the robot looked</i>
<i>  fantastic just aesthetically,</i>

1:22:36.719 --> 1:22:38.686
<i>  but then their driving</i>
<i>  is on point.</i>

1:22:38.688 --> 1:22:40.454
Their weapon is hitting hard.

1:22:40.456 --> 1:22:42.389
Everything is going perfectly
for them right now.

1:22:42.391 --> 1:22:44.658
<i> [chris] and what a great</i>
<i>  fight card we had tonight.</i>

1:22:44.660 --> 1:22:49.229
<i>  Rotator improved to 2-0</i>
<i>  in a blazing barbeque</i>

<i>  by minotaur,</i>

1:22:51.467 --> 1:22:56.837

<i>  the brazilians back</i>
<i>  to their winning ways.</i>

<i>  back with its first win</i>

1:23:04.413 --> 1:23:07.581

<i>  this year?</i>

1:23:14.857 --> 1:23:19.059
Well, this was a ton of fun,
as always, so for faruq,
