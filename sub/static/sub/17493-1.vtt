00:02.000 --> 00:04.080
- Sarah and Duck.
- QUACK!

00:04.080 --> 00:05.680
- Sarah and Duck.
- QUACK!

00:07.360 --> 00:09.280
- Sarah and Duck.
- QUACK!

00:11.280 --> 00:12.840
- Sarah and Duck.
- QUACK!

00:15.640 --> 00:20.240
Today, Sarah and Duck are in the living room, making paper planes.

00:21.240 --> 00:22.320
Mm. Ha!

00:23.360 --> 00:25.200
QUACK-QUACK-QUACK. QUACK.

00:25.200 --> 00:26.480
Ooh!

00:26.480 --> 00:28.040
It's good, Duck.

00:28.040 --> 00:31.000
Ready to see whose plane flies the furthest?

00:31.000 --> 00:32.040
Yes!

00:34.760 --> 00:36.520
Ready for takeoff.

00:36.520 --> 00:38.200
Chocks away!

00:38.200 --> 00:39.280
Huh?

00:39.280 --> 00:44.080
Oh. Er, it's just something pilots used to say before taking off.

00:44.080 --> 00:45.800
- Oh.
- QUACK-QUACK.

00:45.800 --> 00:47.360
Socks away!

00:48.880 --> 00:50.160
Humph!

00:50.160 --> 00:52.240
Maybe said it wrong.

00:52.240 --> 00:53.320
Your go, Duck.

00:55.480 --> 00:56.600
QUACK!

00:57.920 --> 01:00.000
- Good throw, Duck.
- QUACK!

01:00.000 --> 01:02.080
Yeah, good one.

01:03.320 --> 01:04.360
My go.

01:05.680 --> 01:07.320
Socks away!

01:08.360 --> 01:09.520
Huh?

01:09.520 --> 01:12.440
I guess that makes Duck the winner.

01:12.440 --> 01:14.360
QUACK! QUACK! QUACK! QUACK!

01:14.360 --> 01:15.600
Gah!

01:15.600 --> 01:18.200
You can always make a better plane.

01:18.200 --> 01:19.480
Ran out of paper.

01:19.480 --> 01:22.040
There must be more somewhere?

01:22.040 --> 01:23.120
Oh, yeah.

01:26.600 --> 01:28.760
Are you going to use your drawings?

01:28.760 --> 01:30.000
Uh-huh.

01:30.000 --> 01:31.080
I've got lots.

01:36.680 --> 01:37.920
Looks nice.

01:37.920 --> 01:39.040
See?

01:39.040 --> 01:41.240
Never hurts to recycle, I suppose.

01:41.240 --> 01:42.360
QUACK!

01:42.360 --> 01:43.840
Socks away!

01:44.880 --> 01:45.920
A-ha!

01:45.920 --> 01:47.040
Bravo!

01:49.560 --> 01:50.800
Huh?

01:53.080 --> 01:54.360
QUACK, QUACK!

01:54.360 --> 01:55.440
Wah!

01:58.480 --> 01:59.920
Well, I never!

02:06.040 --> 02:07.240
Wow.

02:08.280 --> 02:11.000
It's almost as if it knew where it was going.

02:12.560 --> 02:14.160
Hmmm?

02:14.160 --> 02:16.960
The plane found the lemons.

02:16.960 --> 02:19.360
Because they were drawn on the paper?

02:19.360 --> 02:21.320
Uh-huh. Let's do it again.

02:27.920 --> 02:28.960
QUACK!

02:28.960 --> 02:32.480
Flamingo and John? Aren't they a bit far away?

02:32.480 --> 02:33.640
Nope.

02:33.640 --> 02:34.800
Fair enough.

02:39.000 --> 02:41.680
How are the flying conditions, Duck?

02:41.680 --> 02:42.800
QUACK, QUACK!

02:42.800 --> 02:43.880
OK.

02:43.880 --> 02:46.840
One, two, three...

02:46.840 --> 02:48.720
Socks away!

02:54.920 --> 02:56.680
- Oh!
- Woo!
- Whoa!
- Ahh!

03:14.920 --> 03:16.080
Meargh!

03:17.280 --> 03:18.560
Urgh!

03:18.560 --> 03:20.480
You got the plane!

03:20.480 --> 03:21.760
I think it got me.

03:21.760 --> 03:22.800
SQUAWK!

03:24.080 --> 03:26.880
The picture showed it where to go.

03:26.880 --> 03:28.080
See?

03:28.080 --> 03:29.480
Wow!

03:29.480 --> 03:31.080
Coo.

03:31.080 --> 03:32.480
Coo-er.

03:32.480 --> 03:34.320
QUACK, QUACK!

03:35.480 --> 03:38.280
- How far can they fly?
- Hmm.

03:38.280 --> 03:40.600
You're the furthest we've tried.

03:40.600 --> 03:42.360
Hmm.

03:42.360 --> 03:48.400
How about we send one to the pyramids?

03:48.400 --> 03:49.520
Ooh.

03:49.520 --> 03:50.920
Sounds good to me.

03:50.920 --> 03:51.960
Yes!

04:08.920 --> 04:12.160
Well, this is as good a launchpad as you can get.

04:12.160 --> 04:13.360
Uh-huh.

04:13.360 --> 04:14.960
OK.

04:14.960 --> 04:16.560
Socks away!

04:21.520 --> 04:23.040
That can't be right.

04:24.960 --> 04:26.280
Oh.

04:26.280 --> 04:29.600
Your picture did look a bit like those hay bales.

04:29.600 --> 04:31.080
- QUACK!
- HEE-HAW!

04:31.080 --> 04:32.880
Hmm.

04:32.880 --> 04:34.800
Needs a better picture.

04:34.800 --> 04:36.240
And a new plane.

04:36.240 --> 04:37.480
Uh-huh.

04:50.040 --> 04:51.120
SQUAWK!

04:52.880 --> 04:53.960
QUACK!

04:56.640 --> 04:58.200
Wow.

04:58.200 --> 05:00.040
QUACK-QUACK!

05:00.040 --> 05:01.080
Look, Duck!

05:01.080 --> 05:02.640
We made a new one.

05:03.840 --> 05:05.000
QUACK!

05:07.600 --> 05:08.680
QUACK!

05:09.680 --> 05:11.640
Well then, let's get airborne.

05:11.640 --> 05:13.680
- Erm, wait a minute.
- SQUAWK!

05:13.680 --> 05:16.520
- Need a picture for the cockpit.
- Oh?

05:16.520 --> 05:19.280
Whoever gets it will know where it came from.

05:19.280 --> 05:20.480
Great idea!

05:20.480 --> 05:22.440
They might even send one back.

05:22.440 --> 05:23.640
Oh!

05:23.640 --> 05:25.040
- Come on, Duck.
- QUACK!

05:25.040 --> 05:27.160
CAMERA TIMER BEEPS

05:31.840 --> 05:33.200
Whoa!

05:34.960 --> 05:36.520
Ready to launch?

05:36.520 --> 05:37.960
Yes.

05:37.960 --> 05:39.600
Socks away!

05:48.000 --> 05:49.880
Do you think it will get there?

05:49.880 --> 05:51.120
Yes.

05:51.120 --> 05:52.200
Good.

05:55.320 --> 05:57.920
The pyramids are very far away.

05:57.920 --> 05:59.320
Mmm.

05:59.320 --> 06:00.840
Why not get some sleep?

06:01.800 --> 06:03.360
OK.

06:03.360 --> 06:05.040
Night-night.

06:05.040 --> 06:06.360
OWL HOOTS

06:06.360 --> 06:07.600
Goodnight.

06:10.840 --> 06:12.200
OWL HOOTS

06:23.840 --> 06:26.240
QUACK! QUACK! QUACK!

06:26.240 --> 06:27.280
SQUAWK!

06:27.280 --> 06:28.320
Plane.

06:28.320 --> 06:29.360
It made it.

06:30.360 --> 06:31.480
Oh!

06:31.480 --> 06:34.320
They must have found it and sent this one back.

06:36.040 --> 06:37.360
QUACK! QUACK!

06:38.680 --> 06:39.960
SQUAWK!

06:39.960 --> 06:41.560
Look.

06:41.560 --> 06:42.640
It's us.

06:45.440 --> 06:47.160
- Sarah and Duck.
- QUACK!

06:49.040 --> 06:51.040
- Sarah and Duck.
- QUACK!

06:52.440 --> 06:54.240
- Sarah and Duck.
- QUACK!

06:56.360 --> 06:58.000
- Sarah and Duck.
- QUACK!
