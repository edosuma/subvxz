WEBVTT

00:02.294 --> 00:03.754
I acknowledge that, henceforth,

00:03.836 --> 00:08.132
my access to my memories
will be spatially dictated.

00:09.218 --> 00:11.720
I will be unable to access
outside recollections

00:11.803 --> 00:14.848
whilst on Lumon's severed basement floor,

00:14.932 --> 00:17.351
nor retain work memories upon my ascent.

00:19.728 --> 00:22.898
I am aware that this alteration

00:22.981 --> 00:25.526
is comprehensive and irreversible.

00:27.569 --> 00:29.112
I make these statements freely.

00:30.656 --> 00:34.117
Okay, that's a wrap.

00:37.204 --> 00:38.205
Come with me, please.

00:44.920 --> 00:48.257
So your work personage will be waking
in a few hours on the severed floor.

00:48.340 --> 00:51.593
But the next time you yourself
will be sentient will be this evening,

00:51.677 --> 00:53.136
in the elevator back up.

00:53.220 --> 00:54.221
Okay.

00:54.763 --> 00:58.267
The elevator has a handrail at hip-level
if you feel dizzy.

00:58.350 --> 00:59.768
Oh, man.

01:02.437 --> 01:04.815
I love seeing the sunrise on his face.

01:06.483 --> 01:09.361
You know he used to drink three raw eggs
in milk each morning?

01:09.444 --> 01:10.445
I've heard.

01:10.946 --> 01:12.114
His favorite breakfast.

01:12.990 --> 01:14.533
We'll get you prepped in here.

01:15.576 --> 01:17.160
- Good morning, Lawrence.
- Good morning.

01:43.854 --> 01:45.189
They say it doesn't hurt.

01:50.068 --> 01:51.403
Just relax.

02:07.669 --> 02:09.378
Little vibration now.

02:47.501 --> 02:50.003
I'll be upstairs after
to let you know how it went.

02:51.964 --> 02:53.757
Sorry if I freak out on you a little.

02:55.509 --> 02:58.428
Don't worry. I'm very excited to meet you.

03:40.721 --> 03:41.805
Hey, Helly.

03:42.931 --> 03:43.932
What's happening?

03:44.016 --> 03:45.142
Great to see you.

03:46.310 --> 03:48.103
Your orientation's been so much fun.

03:51.231 --> 03:52.232
Where am I?

03:52.733 --> 03:57.404
Okay, so sometimes when a new hire
is adjusting to a severed space,

03:57.487 --> 03:59.698
we help by bringing them here
to the stairwell,

03:59.781 --> 04:01.658
to experience the transition viscerally.

04:01.742 --> 04:03.619
Oh, no. I'm trying to leave?

04:03.702 --> 04:04.912
No, no.

04:04.995 --> 04:06.455
It's all part of the process.

04:06.538 --> 04:08.957
If you wanna spin around
and head back in, that should be that.

04:13.837 --> 04:14.838
Hey, there.

04:17.757 --> 04:20.427
- What the hell?
- That's okay.

04:21.261 --> 04:22.262
Not a problem.

04:22.930 --> 04:24.640
Wanna give it another shot?

04:24.723 --> 04:26.141
Maybe with a little oomph?

04:31.480 --> 04:32.314
Hi.

04:32.898 --> 04:33.982
I'm at the stairwell.

04:35.234 --> 04:36.777
It's going fair.

04:38.028 --> 04:39.321
No, she's--

04:39.404 --> 04:40.405
Fuck!

04:41.907 --> 04:42.991
I'ma call you back.

04:45.244 --> 04:46.245
Wow.

04:49.081 --> 04:50.415
You're an inquisitive one.

04:51.166 --> 04:52.501
I don't wanna be in there, do I?

04:52.584 --> 04:53.794
You're learning that you do.

04:54.920 --> 04:58.882
Hey, when we heard you were coming here,
it was like a miracle.

04:59.550 --> 05:01.593
It's amazing what you're doing.

05:24.283 --> 05:25.367
Hey, old-timer!

05:25.868 --> 05:27.160
One day down.

08:42.231 --> 08:43.232
Hey.

08:44.232 --> 08:45.234
Hey.

08:45.317 --> 08:46.610
So it's tomorrow now?

08:47.903 --> 08:48.946
Yeah.

08:49.029 --> 08:50.822
Well, it's Monday.

08:51.615 --> 08:53.200
- A weekend just happened?
- Yeah.

08:53.283 --> 08:54.701
I don't even feel like I left.

08:54.785 --> 08:57.496
Yeah, that's how nights
and weekends feel here.

08:58.288 --> 08:59.289
Like nothing?

08:59.373 --> 09:00.499
Well, you get used to it.

09:00.582 --> 09:03.210
I mean, I find it helps to
focus on the effects of sleep

09:03.293 --> 09:05.629
since we don't actually
get to experience it.

09:05.712 --> 09:09.216
You may feel rejuvenated or happy.

09:09.299 --> 09:11.885
Less tense in the shoulders. Spry.

09:14.221 --> 09:15.931
So it's 09:05?

09:16.014 --> 09:19.268
Yeah, they stagger the entries too
so we don't meet on the outside.

09:19.351 --> 09:20.686
It's important apparently.

09:23.313 --> 09:24.940
So I guess we're not friends.

09:26.733 --> 09:27.901
Guess not.

09:32.072 --> 09:34.074
My current file's called "Tumwater"…

09:34.157 --> 09:36.368
which I started some 11 weeks back.

09:36.451 --> 09:37.786
"Tumwater." All one word.

09:37.870 --> 09:39.413
Should I be taking notes?

09:39.496 --> 09:41.832
- No.
- I've got it 96% sorted,

09:41.915 --> 09:44.585
which means I've earned
four of the five tier incentives,

09:44.668 --> 09:49.256
including the erasers and the finger traps
that you see displayed here.

09:49.840 --> 09:53.010
100% is tier five.
That gets you a caricature portrait.

09:53.802 --> 09:56.972
You'll note I've accrued
an embarrassment of wealth in that regard.

09:57.055 --> 09:58.515
- Wow.
- Correct.

09:58.599 --> 10:00.976
Each one of these?
Finished file in the can.

10:01.685 --> 10:03.312
So that's the highest award?

10:03.395 --> 10:04.521
Percentage-wise, yes.

10:04.605 --> 10:06.690
But if we hit our numbers
by quarter's end,

10:06.773 --> 10:08.817
one of us gets named
refiner of the quarter,

10:08.901 --> 10:11.195
and that shit gets you a waffle party.

10:11.278 --> 10:12.863
I'm sorry, a waffle party?

10:12.946 --> 10:14.364
Okay, hazards on, eager lemur.

10:14.448 --> 10:17.701
I'm a dead lock for that this quarter,
so don't get your hopes up.

10:20.621 --> 10:22.414
What about Mark's crystal head cube?

10:22.998 --> 10:25.417
That's not a prize,
that's just something they gave him.

10:25.501 --> 10:27.878
Helly, could you flip on this console?

10:44.144 --> 10:45.479
Okay.

10:48.065 --> 10:49.191
That's-- Excuse me.

10:56.406 --> 10:58.951
Mark, sorry to interrupt.
I know you're training Helly.

10:59.034 --> 11:02.246
I just noticed you've removed
the group photos from the desks.

11:02.329 --> 11:05.457
Yeah. We're gonna take the new ones
at Helly's party today.

11:08.669 --> 11:11.880
Okay, this is the Siena file.

11:11.964 --> 11:13.799
Now, all the data you see

11:13.882 --> 11:17.344
falls into one of four
essential categories.

11:17.427 --> 11:19.555
And we group each line of code,

11:19.638 --> 11:24.184
and then sort it evenly
between five digital buckets.

11:24.268 --> 11:25.269
Party.

11:25.352 --> 11:27.229
Just poke around first. Use the arrows.

11:27.855 --> 11:31.233
I do think the old photos are supposed
to stay on the desk

11:31.316 --> 11:32.943
until the new ones come in.

11:39.950 --> 11:40.951
Right.

11:41.535 --> 11:43.787
- Should this mean something to me?
- No.

11:43.871 --> 11:46.331
No, all the data
comes from upstairs fully encoded.

11:47.416 --> 11:48.917
Then how do I categorize it?

11:51.003 --> 11:52.045
What?

11:53.505 --> 11:58.677
Each category of numbers
presents in such an order as to elicit

11:58.760 --> 12:00.971
an emotional response in the refiner.

12:02.055 --> 12:07.477
So, Cat 1 numbers, for example,
feel a certain way on sight.

12:07.561 --> 12:10.731
They'll be sort of disconcerting, scary.

12:10.814 --> 12:11.815
Scary?

12:11.899 --> 12:13.108
I know.

12:13.192 --> 12:14.943
My job is to scroll
through this spreadsheet

12:15.027 --> 12:16.612
and look for numbers that are scary?

12:16.695 --> 12:18.697
It sounds dumb, and Mark said it dumb.

12:19.281 --> 12:21.950
Are the numbers bloody? Do they chant?

12:22.034 --> 12:24.912
It doesn't make sense till you see it,
and it takes a while to see.

12:24.995 --> 12:26.872
Hey, Mark. I just printed out

12:26.955 --> 12:29.333
the passage of the handbook
on changing out group photos.

12:29.416 --> 12:32.544
Just might be good to peruse
when you're between things.

12:32.628 --> 12:34.463
- Thank you.
- Sorry.

12:37.883 --> 12:38.967
Am I trapped here?

12:41.178 --> 12:42.638
In what way?

12:42.721 --> 12:46.433
Like if it turns out I hate this
and I want to quit, is that an option?

12:50.145 --> 12:51.188
Look.

12:52.523 --> 12:53.815
If you're really unhappy,

12:53.899 --> 12:58.111
you can submit a resignation request
with your outside self for review.

12:58.195 --> 13:00.072
And good luck getting that approved.

13:00.155 --> 13:03.867
Well, they do tend to be rejected.
Plus, you know…

13:05.452 --> 13:06.453
What?

13:07.329 --> 13:12.167
Well, since this perceptual version of you
only exists at Lumon,

13:13.001 --> 13:15.462
I mean, quitting
would effectively end your life.

13:15.546 --> 13:17.464
I mean, in so much
as you've come to know it.

13:19.508 --> 13:20.968
Hello, Refiners.

13:21.635 --> 13:23.136
Sweet. Melon bar.

13:23.220 --> 13:24.680
Hi, Mr. Milchick.

13:24.763 --> 13:27.099
Helly, welcome.

13:27.182 --> 13:30.686
I'm agog at how well I can tell
you're already fitting in.

13:31.728 --> 13:33.397
The office feels whole.

13:34.815 --> 13:38.527
Now, let's get this party started.

13:44.533 --> 13:47.870
Well, my name is Irving, as you all know.

13:47.953 --> 13:50.122
And I've worked here for three years,

13:50.205 --> 13:55.002
and something about me is that
I know all nine core Lumon principles.

13:55.085 --> 13:57.546
Awesome. What's your favorite?

14:00.549 --> 14:01.550
All nine.

14:02.426 --> 14:06.680
But today, I think I'd say, "cheer".

14:06.763 --> 14:07.764
Great.

14:12.769 --> 14:14.229
No trust fall today, Irv.

14:16.440 --> 14:17.441
Right.

14:26.158 --> 14:28.202
No. No.

14:35.918 --> 14:37.878
Hello, I'm Helly.

14:37.961 --> 14:39.671
I've been at Lumon for, like…

14:40.672 --> 14:41.840
ten hours total, and…

14:44.426 --> 14:46.553
I'm sorry,
I don't know anything about myself.

14:47.554 --> 14:48.847
Sure you do, Helly.

14:50.265 --> 14:51.308
I really don't.

14:52.684 --> 14:53.894
I guess I went home last night,

14:53.977 --> 14:56.063
but I don't know if home is a house,
or an apartment,

14:56.146 --> 14:57.231
or if I live with a family--

14:57.314 --> 14:59.983
I like to think my outie lives on,
like, a riverboat.

15:02.110 --> 15:03.612
I'm sorry, outies are--

15:03.695 --> 15:06.490
They're us on the outside.

15:06.573 --> 15:08.784
You saw yours yesterday in the video.

15:08.867 --> 15:12.120
Right. I actually have a few things to say
to her. Can I record something back?

15:14.248 --> 15:16.917
So what you'll find here is that
communication between selves

15:17.000 --> 15:18.377
is pretty curtailed.

15:18.877 --> 15:20.462
So what if I write her a note?

15:20.546 --> 15:24.591
Fortunately, the elevators are equipped
with something called "code detectors."

15:25.300 --> 15:26.969
So messages can't be passed through.

15:27.052 --> 15:30.472
Yeah-- They're like metal detectors
for written symbols.

15:30.556 --> 15:31.807
A Lumon original, apparently.

15:31.890 --> 15:32.975
That's right. Right.

15:33.058 --> 15:34.893
Sure. Okay, well what if I--

15:34.977 --> 15:37.688
I don't think you're quite
getting the game here, Helly.

15:38.856 --> 15:39.898
May I?

15:42.776 --> 15:44.027
Guys, this is Helly.

15:44.111 --> 15:47.447
She's 30 years old, she's allergic
to almonds and has weak enamel.

15:48.198 --> 15:51.243
At 5'6'', she's the fourth tallest person
in your office,

15:51.326 --> 15:54.496
and her hair
is what we call shoulder-length.

15:56.123 --> 16:00.419
And seeing her here with you all,
I'd say she most definitely has a family.

16:06.341 --> 16:09.094
Wow. Well, that's a lot to follow.

16:09.803 --> 16:12.514
So I'll just say that I'm Mark.

16:12.598 --> 16:18.312
Been with Lumon about two years,
and I absolutely love this game.

16:20.105 --> 16:23.567
Nice try, pal,
but you said that last time.

16:24.902 --> 16:26.361
Fair enough.

16:30.199 --> 16:31.200
Well, I…

16:36.788 --> 16:40.334
I broke protocol this morning.

16:43.921 --> 16:46.924
I was dusting the old group photos,
the ones with Petey,

16:47.007 --> 16:48.550
and it just…

16:49.843 --> 16:52.054
made me feel sad.

16:53.639 --> 16:55.265
And, I guess,

16:56.225 --> 17:00.103
worried that I won't be able to
run MDR like he did.

17:00.187 --> 17:02.231
That tracks. I have similar worries.

17:03.565 --> 17:04.775
So I…

17:05.776 --> 17:08.862
took 'em from the cubicles
and put 'em in the storage closet,

17:08.945 --> 17:11.156
which we're not supposed to do.

17:13.534 --> 17:15.702
I recall this. I objected.

17:19.455 --> 17:21.124
Thank you for telling me, Mark.

17:22.667 --> 17:25.253
I actually find your reaction sweet.

17:25.337 --> 17:29.383
Though, it is puzzling
you have an outburst like this for Petey,

17:29.466 --> 17:32.553
and not for, say, Carol D.

17:33.512 --> 17:36.557
But we knew
Carol D. was leaving beforehand.

17:36.640 --> 17:38.600
I mean, her outie filmed a thank-you.

17:39.560 --> 17:41.728
Petey was just gone.

17:43.105 --> 17:45.107
And I mean, I-- I don't know

17:45.190 --> 17:51.488
if he's at some new job
or drunk on a beach, or dead--

17:51.572 --> 17:53.031
That's enough, please.

18:02.916 --> 18:05.043
I think this is a good time
to remind ourselves

18:05.127 --> 18:08.255
that things like deaths
happen outside of here.

18:09.715 --> 18:10.716
Not here.

18:12.134 --> 18:15.179
A life at Lumon is protected
from such things.

18:16.305 --> 18:21.977
And I think a great potential response
to that from all of you is gratitude.

18:30.110 --> 18:33.614
I also think
that melon isn't getting any tastier.

19:08.732 --> 19:10.400
Hey, sorry I derailed your game.

19:11.443 --> 19:15.280
I thought I already had, but then, yeah,
you made it way worse.

19:18.492 --> 19:20.786
So how are you gonna figure out
if Petey's okay?

19:20.869 --> 19:23.372
I think Milchick was pretty clear.

19:24.289 --> 19:26.041
You're just done
asking about your best friend

19:26.124 --> 19:27.918
because our babysitter told you to stop?

19:30.045 --> 19:32.214
You know, Milchick's a nice man.

19:32.297 --> 19:35.175
When he says something,
it's best to listen.

19:35.259 --> 19:38.095
- I don't care.
- 'Cause he can't always be nice like that.

19:38.720 --> 19:40.097
Okay, Refiners!

19:40.180 --> 19:43.350
Let's get this new group photo
before the melon bloat sets in.

19:55.445 --> 19:56.488
At last.

19:59.324 --> 20:04.329
All right. Great big smiles. Remember,
you're gonna be looking at this every day.

20:06.164 --> 20:07.624
Say "gratitude."

20:08.333 --> 20:09.585
Gratitude!

20:12.754 --> 20:13.881
Say "cheer."

20:14.423 --> 20:15.883
Cheer!

20:20.262 --> 20:22.181
Helly? What are you doing?

20:22.264 --> 20:26.143
I just think
I'm not gonna work here anymore. Sorry.

20:26.226 --> 20:27.394
What do you mean?

20:27.978 --> 20:28.937
I quit.

20:29.021 --> 20:30.731
I don't wanna do the file-sorting thing

20:30.814 --> 20:33.150
or the never-seeing-the-sun-thing
or the disappearing-friends thing.

20:33.233 --> 20:35.694
- I just don't want any of it.
- We told you there's code detectors.

20:35.777 --> 20:39.489
Do you know that? Have you tried?
Because frankly, it sounds made-up.

20:47.581 --> 20:48.582
Helly!

20:52.127 --> 20:53.253
Helly!

21:04.890 --> 21:07.142
Please, you don't know--

21:09.061 --> 21:10.646
Oh, God. Come on.

21:20.989 --> 21:23.116
Shit. Mr. Graner?

21:26.703 --> 21:27.704
Come on out.

21:33.627 --> 21:35.045
What have we got here?

21:38.173 --> 21:39.675
Perhaps you'd better come with me.

21:39.758 --> 21:40.843
Mr. Graner.

21:43.554 --> 21:47.766
Hey. I see you've found
my wayward trainee.

21:48.892 --> 21:50.936
Appreciate your help, sir, as always.

21:53.981 --> 21:54.982
The note.

21:55.607 --> 21:59.403
So, this is embarrassing,
but it's my first time training,

21:59.486 --> 22:03.699
and I must've just forgotten to go over
data-smuggling rules with Helly.

22:05.158 --> 22:06.702
Sorry. This is Helly.

22:06.785 --> 22:07.786
Helly, Mr. Graner.

22:08.996 --> 22:09.997
Yeah.

22:12.165 --> 22:14.668
Yeah, so if Helly
tripped the code detectors,

22:14.751 --> 22:19.298
that one, it's on me
and I apologize for that, sir.

22:19.798 --> 22:20.799
Earnestly.

22:22.593 --> 22:24.303
Big department chief now, Mark S.?

22:24.970 --> 22:25.971
Well…

22:27.556 --> 22:30.517
On you, then. Let's go.

23:46.635 --> 23:47.886
Mark.

23:51.056 --> 23:52.933
So you're a doula?

23:53.016 --> 23:55.352
A midwife, actually.

23:57.688 --> 24:01.525
And how many deliveries have you,
I don't know, seen?

24:05.404 --> 24:06.822
Over 300?

24:07.447 --> 24:09.199
This is mostly back in Montana.

24:09.283 --> 24:11.743
- Wow. That's so cool.
- Yeah.

24:11.827 --> 24:14.162
That's such a high amount.

24:14.246 --> 24:17.749
Yeah. We get two a day.

24:18.876 --> 24:19.918
Depending.

24:30.012 --> 24:32.723
So, is that, like, ten a week?

24:32.806 --> 24:34.725
Like, in a five-day work week, or…

24:34.808 --> 24:36.435
- Yeah, or so.
- Yeah. Okay.

24:37.436 --> 24:41.106
- Are you vetting me for your sister?
- No. Oh, no. You seem great.

24:41.190 --> 24:42.733
- Yeah, I'm kidding.
- I know.

24:52.326 --> 24:53.410
Thank you.

24:53.493 --> 24:55.996
So, Lumon?

24:57.122 --> 24:58.957
- Yeah.
- Like half this town.

24:59.791 --> 25:01.835
And half of me. That was a joke.

25:02.961 --> 25:03.962
It was funny.

25:04.046 --> 25:09.885
Yeah. I'm in the archives division,
sort of a corporate historian, apparently.

25:10.802 --> 25:14.181
So a lot of sensitive material, hence the…

25:16.892 --> 25:18.310
So you don't know…

25:19.770 --> 25:23.148
who you work with, or what you do,
or-- or anything?

25:23.232 --> 25:24.942
Yeah, that's the idea.

25:25.025 --> 25:27.319
- What if you snuck in a note?
- You can't sneak notes.

25:27.903 --> 25:28.946
So…

25:30.030 --> 25:31.907
- you could have a girlfriend at Lumon…
- Thank you.

25:31.990 --> 25:32.991
…and not know it.

25:33.075 --> 25:35.702
And if you met someone out here,
you wouldn't know it in there.

25:36.286 --> 25:38.163
Like, you could get married and have kids,

25:38.247 --> 25:40.791
and just forget they exist
for eight hours every day,

25:40.874 --> 25:42.251
for your whole life.

25:42.835 --> 25:44.336
That doesn't mess with your head?

25:47.631 --> 25:50.384
I think for some people, it's the point.

25:55.305 --> 25:59.560
So, as a local, this just feels like
a reasonable temperature to you?

25:59.643 --> 26:01.603
Well, technically, I'm from Ganz.

26:01.687 --> 26:04.022
And you're one to talk.

26:04.106 --> 26:08.318
Isn't Minnesota, like,
crazy cold with the lakes?

26:08.402 --> 26:10.737
Yes. Minnesota was very cold

26:10.821 --> 26:14.908
the one time I visited
from my home in Montana.

26:15.868 --> 26:17.035
So those are different places.

26:20.414 --> 26:22.165
So do you live in Lumon housing?

26:23.500 --> 26:25.669
You make it sound like dorms or something.

26:26.420 --> 26:28.589
- No, I just meant that there's--
- I live in Baird Creek.

26:28.672 --> 26:33.343
And, yes, they happen to be subsidized
by the company that employs me.

26:33.427 --> 26:35.721
Excuse me, do you have a moment
for children's brain health?

26:35.804 --> 26:37.389
And legalized severance in the workplace?

26:38.974 --> 26:41.602
- Nice. The WMC's out and about.
- Who?

26:41.685 --> 26:44.313
Most severed workers don't see the sun
their whole lives.

26:44.396 --> 26:46.690
The Whole Mind Collective. They're great.

26:46.773 --> 26:49.443
Excuse me, do you have a moment
for children's brain health?

26:49.526 --> 26:50.527
We're all good.

26:50.611 --> 26:52.487
You folks have a moment
for children's brain health?

26:52.571 --> 26:53.447
- We do.
- Great!

26:53.530 --> 26:55.240
We're trying to get a measure
on the ballot

26:55.324 --> 26:58.076
to keep mega-corporations like Lumon
from continuing to force

26:58.160 --> 26:59.411
legalized severance on our state.

26:59.494 --> 27:00.871
They're forcing it now?

27:00.954 --> 27:03.749
That's what they're lobbying for.
And Jame Eagan is trying to sever kids--

27:03.832 --> 27:07.085
Okay, well, what about the self-mutilating
types who do it willingly?

27:07.169 --> 27:09.671
I mean, I heard that some of them
are so deluded

27:09.755 --> 27:11.507
they don't even know they're victims.

27:11.590 --> 27:14.176
I also heard that if you're severed,

27:14.259 --> 27:17.346
you go to two separate hells.
Is that true?

27:17.429 --> 27:19.848
Hey, man, you wanna benefit off
forced labor, that's up…

27:19.932 --> 27:22.142
- Hey, man. Forced labor?
- …then that's up to you.

27:22.226 --> 27:23.268
Fucking really?

27:23.352 --> 27:24.561
- Hey!
- Yeah.

27:24.645 --> 27:25.938
- Forced labor? Okay.
- Really.

27:26.021 --> 27:28.482
So people can just, like, self-imprison?

27:28.565 --> 27:30.067
Are you captive right now?

27:30.150 --> 27:34.363
No, seriously, because your past self
chose to walk you down here

27:34.446 --> 27:36.907
to be an infantilizing prick to people.

27:36.990 --> 27:39.785
Severance is subjugation, asshole.

27:40.786 --> 27:42.621
That's nice language for a--

27:42.704 --> 27:44.122
What-- What are you? Twelve?

27:44.206 --> 27:47.084
Are you 12 years old?
Are you even in high school yet?

27:49.753 --> 27:51.255
Okay. Come on.

28:21.952 --> 28:22.953
Mrs. Selvig.

28:23.453 --> 28:24.746
Peace offering.

28:25.789 --> 28:26.790
Are we fighting?

28:26.874 --> 28:30.002
I just keep thinking
about those damn bins.

28:30.961 --> 28:35.382
Well, that is so not necessary,
but very kind. Thank you.

28:38.760 --> 28:41.221
Here, why don't you come in? I have milk.

28:41.930 --> 28:43.682
- Why, thank you!
- Yeah.

28:46.018 --> 28:49.855
I'm experimenting with chamomile,
so no hard feelings if you gag.

28:49.938 --> 28:51.106
I'm sure I won't.

28:54.359 --> 28:58.030
Still waiting for that third bulb
to revive itself?

28:58.113 --> 29:01.158
Oh, yeah. Keep forgetting to change that.

29:01.950 --> 29:04.786
My, you smell nice. Were you on a date?

29:05.829 --> 29:12.753
Sort of. My sister set me up with,
like, her doula, or midwife.

29:12.836 --> 29:14.505
Didn't really feel like anything.

29:19.885 --> 29:22.262
Well, let's see here. I'll…

29:32.064 --> 29:33.190
Wow.

29:33.690 --> 29:35.150
This i-- These are magic.

29:39.446 --> 29:41.281
My late husband was a carpenter,

29:41.365 --> 29:42.824
and before he passed,

29:42.908 --> 29:47.788
he said he would start building us
a house in the hereafter.

29:48.830 --> 29:52.292
And there would be
a small guest apartment in the back,

29:52.376 --> 29:55.337
in case I found a new man
before I got there.

29:58.966 --> 30:00.843
That's… so sweet.

30:02.970 --> 30:07.516
Yes. He even drew blueprints,
which I keep in my purse.

30:13.063 --> 30:14.648
Well, come by the shop, okay?

30:14.731 --> 30:19.319
I'll give you a mugwort bath bomb
that'll make you sleep like a rag doll.

30:19.403 --> 30:20.863
I'll try to get down there.

30:21.947 --> 30:23.448
Good night, Mrs. Selvig.

31:19.922 --> 31:21.924
The nerve, my new partner's a woman.

31:22.007 --> 31:24.259
I just think
you could've mentioned it sooner.

31:24.343 --> 31:28.931
You'd better be on the stakeout
and not… out for a steak.

32:28.740 --> 32:30.868
Seth Milchick, Lumon Industries.

32:30.951 --> 32:33.036
Mr. Milchick, it's Mark Scout.

32:33.120 --> 32:36.081
I'm a severed worker.
Employee number 4502.

32:36.164 --> 32:39.168
Mr. Scout, what a pleasure.
How can I help you?

32:39.251 --> 32:41.712
I actually woke up
not feeling terribly well.

32:41.795 --> 32:43.380
I'm sorry I'm just now calling.

32:44.047 --> 32:47.176
Oh, no. May I ask how serious it is?

32:47.259 --> 32:51.930
Well, nothing bad,
just very minor stomach event.

32:52.014 --> 32:53.307
Should be back tomorrow.

32:54.391 --> 32:55.517
Well, I'm sorry.

32:55.601 --> 32:58.228
I know your innie will be sad
to have missed the day.

33:00.522 --> 33:02.983
You feel better. Okay, Mr. Scout?

33:07.946 --> 33:10.324
- Where's Mark?
- Missed you too.

33:10.407 --> 33:13.327
He should be coming down first now.
You don't think that--

33:13.410 --> 33:15.996
He's probably sick. They wouldn't
bounce him and Petey the same week.

33:16.079 --> 33:17.414
I certainly hope not.

33:17.497 --> 33:18.916
Quarterly deadline's coming up,

33:18.999 --> 33:21.502
and I'm not looking
to be department chief.

33:21.585 --> 33:25.422
Wow. Lot a confidence for a man
who once got disciplined for dozing.

33:27.841 --> 33:29.343
Sorry. That was--

33:32.137 --> 33:35.182
I can't help
that I was hired older than you.

33:37.976 --> 33:39.603
It just never stops, huh?

33:39.686 --> 33:40.938
Endless toil.

33:42.272 --> 33:43.398
Where's Mark?

33:43.482 --> 33:45.651
Sick or fired. Probably sick.

33:46.151 --> 33:48.237
They wouldn't have fired him
for my note thing, would they?

33:48.320 --> 33:51.031
No. No way. He did his stint
in the break room yesterday.

33:55.160 --> 33:56.370
He said he was ill.

33:56.954 --> 33:58.163
Did he sound ill?

33:58.247 --> 34:00.499
I don't know. He said it was abdominal.

34:02.042 --> 34:03.210
Funny timing.

34:44.877 --> 34:47.963
The erasers are mostly decorative,
since we don't have pencils.

34:48.045 --> 34:50.382
Finger trap is fun,
as long as you know how to use it safely.

34:50.465 --> 34:53.594
But it's really more about what they
represent, how far you got in the file.

34:54.261 --> 34:57.139
- But why don't we always finish the files?
- 'Cause they only keep so long.

34:57.806 --> 35:01.185
You know, we finish, on average,
one in five files before they expire.

35:01.268 --> 35:04.938
Which is better than it used to be
before Mark's freshman fluke.

35:05.022 --> 35:06.273
What's a freshman fluke?

36:05.332 --> 36:06.416
No!

36:07.251 --> 36:08.252
Irv?

36:11.129 --> 36:12.464
I'm-- I'm sorry.

36:13.257 --> 36:14.299
Irving?

37:17.404 --> 37:20.490
We'll deduct the time you spent dozing
from your outie's paycheck.

37:20.991 --> 37:24.661
What will be harder to fix, Irving,
is my and Ms. Cobel's trust in you.

37:25.204 --> 37:28.081
I'm so sorry, sir. I'm just so sorry.

37:28.165 --> 37:31.126
Well, no one is hankering
to throw you in the break room.

37:31.835 --> 37:34.922
We'll do a wellness check with Ms. Casey
and go from there, all right?

37:35.422 --> 37:36.840
Thank you, Mr. Milchick.

37:59.404 --> 38:00.656
Nothing scary yet.

38:09.957 --> 38:11.291
Oh, God! A four!

38:11.375 --> 38:12.543
Don't fuck around.

38:13.085 --> 38:16.338
I told you, you'll understand
when you see it, so just be patient.

38:16.964 --> 38:18.423
What even are these numbers?

38:18.507 --> 38:20.884
Like, do we even know
what we're supposedly cleaning?

38:23.262 --> 38:24.263
My theory?

38:25.973 --> 38:26.974
The sea.

38:29.268 --> 38:30.269
The sea?

38:30.978 --> 38:32.437
Yeah. Think about it.

38:32.521 --> 38:35.649
Okay, if our outies are up there
severing their brains,

38:35.732 --> 38:37.526
shit must have gotten pretty bad.

38:37.609 --> 38:40.279
Famine, plagues, et cetera.

38:40.362 --> 38:43.574
So what is a desperate humanity to do?

38:46.034 --> 38:47.035
Populate the sea?

38:47.119 --> 38:48.495
Populate the sea.

38:48.579 --> 38:52.332
But first, they gotta send probes
down to the sea to clean up

38:52.416 --> 38:55.878
all the deadly eels and shit,
'cause we can't cohabitate with that.

38:56.378 --> 38:59.882
So we send the probes down,
they send us the data coded,

38:59.965 --> 39:04.511
we sense what's eels, and then
we tell the probes what to blow up.

39:08.015 --> 39:09.266
This is the leading theory?

39:11.226 --> 39:14.313
Nah, Irv thinks we're cutting
swear words out of movies.

39:18.775 --> 39:22.362
But what is it? Like, what-- what
are we actually workin' on down there?

39:24.448 --> 39:25.449
I don't know.

39:26.742 --> 39:29.328
I thought without severance
it would make more sense, but…

39:31.163 --> 39:33.832
They separate us
from the other departments.

39:33.916 --> 39:35.751
We don't even know how many there are.

39:40.255 --> 39:42.508
But I've been reintegrated
for two weeks now.

39:45.135 --> 39:46.887
I've been mapping out the floor.

39:58.607 --> 40:00.984
I hid the original for you when I left.

40:20.963 --> 40:22.089
You okay?

40:30.222 --> 40:31.223
Sorry.

40:32.599 --> 40:33.892
Reintegration sickness.

40:36.520 --> 40:38.188
Never heard of that one.

40:38.981 --> 40:41.400
Because I'm the first dipshit
that's ever had it.

40:42.693 --> 40:46.530
Plus, living in a cold-ass greenhouse
doesn't help, but I can't go home.

40:49.658 --> 40:53.787
Okay, so what is it that happens
down there that's so bad?

40:57.666 --> 40:58.667
There's this room…

41:05.340 --> 41:07.759
We go in there when we don't act right.

41:15.517 --> 41:16.643
What is that?

41:23.358 --> 41:24.943
I'm afraid you're not sorry.

41:26.069 --> 41:30.282
Please. I truly am. I'm sorry.

41:30.365 --> 41:32.034
Please read the statement again.

41:33.994 --> 41:38.415
Forgive me for the harm
I have caused this world.

41:38.498 --> 41:44.338
None may atone for my actions but me,
and only in me shall their stain live on.

41:44.421 --> 41:46.632
I am thankful to have been caught,

41:46.715 --> 41:50.802
my fall cut short
by those with wizened hands.

41:51.678 --> 41:55.307
All I can be is sorry,
and that is all that I am.

41:56.475 --> 42:00.896
I'm afraid you don't mean it.
Again, please.

42:02.439 --> 42:07.069
Forgive me for the harm
I have caused this world.

42:08.570 --> 42:11.865
None may atone for my actions but me.

42:15.327 --> 42:16.662
The fuck is that?

42:19.081 --> 42:20.332
That's the break room.

42:53.448 --> 42:54.700
I'm-- I'm sorry.

42:54.783 --> 42:56.034
No, I'm sorry, sir.

42:56.118 --> 42:58.328
I didn't think anybody was out here.

42:58.412 --> 43:01.206
I'm coming out from my session.

43:01.290 --> 43:06.587
I was just going in.
I was admiring the art while I wait.

43:07.462 --> 43:11.133
That piece hung in the perpetuity wing
for many years.

43:11.216 --> 43:14.094
I know. And it broke my heart
when they took it down.

43:14.678 --> 43:16.972
It's better here. It's calming.

43:20.184 --> 43:22.895
I'm Irving. Macrodata Refinement.

43:23.478 --> 43:24.938
Are you a department head?

43:25.022 --> 43:26.940
Well, Optics and Design.

43:27.691 --> 43:30.152
A two-person department, so, barely.

43:30.235 --> 43:31.653
So this is your work?

43:32.446 --> 43:35.199
We don't paint them. We do hang them.

43:35.282 --> 43:40.495
I loved that you did the Ambrose cycle
in the team-building space last quarter.

43:41.038 --> 43:42.956
I'd never seen it.

43:43.457 --> 43:45.959
Well, it's rare to meet a sophisticate.

43:46.877 --> 43:50.881
Most people only think of O&D
when new handbook totes come in.

43:51.924 --> 43:53.717
Well, I love those too.

43:53.800 --> 43:55.177
Yeah?

43:55.260 --> 43:57.638
There's new ones coming next month.

43:58.597 --> 44:00.390
Best design yet, in my view.

44:01.433 --> 44:05.437
Wow! Well, that's all
I'll be thinking about until then.

44:06.063 --> 44:06.897
Irving?

44:45.352 --> 44:46.645
All right, Irving.

44:47.479 --> 44:51.400
What I'd like to do is share with you
some facts about your outie.

44:52.985 --> 44:58.991
Because your outie is an exemplary person,
these facts should be very pleasing.

45:00.659 --> 45:04.663
Just relax your body
and be open to the facts.

45:05.455 --> 45:08.584
Try to enjoy each equally.

45:09.918 --> 45:13.130
These facts are not to be shared
outside this room.

45:14.673 --> 45:17.885
But for now, they're yours to enjoy.

45:23.390 --> 45:25.350
Your outie is generous.

45:27.978 --> 45:31.899
Your outie is fond of music
and owns many records.

45:33.650 --> 45:39.448
Your outie is a friend to children
and to the elderly and the insane.

45:41.491 --> 45:45.704
Your outie is strong
and helped someone lift a heavy object.

45:47.748 --> 45:53.420
Your outie attends many dances
and is popular among the other attendees.

45:54.755 --> 46:01.720
Your outie likes films
and owns a machine that can play them.

46:03.430 --> 46:08.894
Your outie is splendid
and can swim gracefully and well.

46:10.395 --> 46:11.605
I'm sorry.

46:12.481 --> 46:15.067
Please try to enjoy each fact equally,

46:15.734 --> 46:18.403
and not show preference
for any over the others.

46:18.987 --> 46:21.990
That's ten points off.
You have 90 points remaining.

46:22.074 --> 46:24.284
- Points?
- Please don't speak.

46:32.042 --> 46:34.628
Your outie won a game two weeks ago.

46:36.046 --> 46:38.632
Your outie values water.

46:39.925 --> 46:44.638
A photo of your outie with a trophy
was once in a newspaper.

46:46.265 --> 46:50.602
Your outie has no fear
of muggers or knaves.

46:52.563 --> 46:55.607
Your outie likes the sound of radar.

46:58.193 --> 47:03.073
Your outie is skilled
at kissing and lovemaking.

47:05.909 --> 47:06.910
I'm sorry.

47:06.994 --> 47:09.913
Please don't respond to any specific fact.

47:09.997 --> 47:11.790
That's ten points off.

47:11.874 --> 47:14.084
- I was just--
- Please don't speak further,

47:14.168 --> 47:18.005
or all remaining points will be deducted
and the wellness session will end.

47:35.772 --> 47:36.815
Okay.

47:57.753 --> 47:59.254
- Is it just the elevators?
- What?

47:59.338 --> 48:01.673
With the code detectors.
Or is it the stairwells too?

48:01.757 --> 48:03.675
Jesus. Stairwells too. Why?

48:03.759 --> 48:05.969
If no one accepts the resignations,

48:06.053 --> 48:07.846
what makes you think
they're being delivered at all?

48:07.930 --> 48:10.224
You gotta let
the info-smuggling notion go.

48:10.307 --> 48:11.558
Okay, but how good are the scanners?

48:11.642 --> 48:14.811
Like, what if you wrote the letters funky,
like one of those robot tests?

48:14.895 --> 48:16.772
- Hi, kids. What's for dinner?
- Nope!

48:16.855 --> 48:18.106
How was wellness?

48:18.190 --> 48:20.067
Great. Very restorative.

48:20.150 --> 48:21.944
I met the O&D department head.

48:22.027 --> 48:26.198
Burt? I've met that guy. He's a fuck.
You didn't tell him where we are, did you?

48:26.281 --> 48:28.367
Burt's not a fuck. And no.

48:28.450 --> 48:30.577
I'm asking for the safety
of this department.

48:30.661 --> 48:32.120
- I don't need to tell you--
- That's a myth.

48:32.204 --> 48:34.039
And don't pretend you care
about this department.

48:34.122 --> 48:35.749
You just want your waffle party.

48:35.832 --> 48:38.794
Beg-fucking-pardon.
We're supposed to like the perks.

48:38.877 --> 48:42.881
"And all in Lumon's care shall revel
in the bounty of the incentives spur."

48:42.965 --> 48:45.676
Don't pervert a handbook passage
to me, okay?

48:45.759 --> 48:46.927
- Don't do it.
- Hey, guys?

48:47.010 --> 48:48.846
Lumon has been good to us,
and it is feckless to--

48:48.929 --> 48:49.930
Guys!

48:58.480 --> 48:59.731
That.

49:00.524 --> 49:01.525
Yep.

49:02.150 --> 49:03.694
Why is-- Why is it--

49:03.777 --> 49:06.488
You okay. Just fence off
the bad data like I showed you.

49:06.572 --> 49:08.448
Can you see the perimeter?

49:17.624 --> 49:19.042
And bin it.

49:31.263 --> 49:33.140
Boom. Fucking refined.

49:33.223 --> 49:35.392
All right, Helly. Hip, hip.

49:36.143 --> 49:39.146
They were scary. The numbers were scary.

49:56.997 --> 50:00.375
Here's the couch.
I'll find you a sleeping bag.

50:01.251 --> 50:04.671
And you can use the shower if you want.

50:05.422 --> 50:06.840
What are you trying to say?

50:11.845 --> 50:13.138
Thanks for doing this, Mark.

50:13.680 --> 50:16.517
Well, I, you know, figured my work self
would be pissed

50:16.600 --> 50:18.185
if I let you sleep in a greenhouse.

50:24.316 --> 50:25.317
Light's on the left.

50:53.011 --> 50:54.179
You okay in there?

50:54.263 --> 50:56.557
Yeah! Yeah, I'm good.

52:09.546 --> 52:10.672
Petey, are you okay?
