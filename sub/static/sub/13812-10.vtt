21:19.846 --> 21:22.246
OKAY, OKAY, I SEE IT.

21:22.248 --> 21:25.449
IT'S A KRABBY PATTY, OKAY?

21:25.451 --> 21:27.618
I COULDN'T HELP IT.

21:27.620 --> 21:29.687
BUT WE SANG
THE FUN SONG.

21:29.689 --> 21:32.590
I THINK I'M GOING
TO BE SICK.

21:32.592 --> 21:33.858
HOW LONG?

21:33.860 --> 21:35.092
HOW LONG WHAT?

21:35.094 --> 21:38.663
HOW LONG WERE YOU
PLANNING ON DOING THIS?!

21:40.166 --> 21:41.432
TELL ME!

21:41.434 --> 21:43.534
(<i> crying</i> )

21:43.536 --> 21:44.168
WHAT?!

21:44.170 --> 21:46.137
ALL RIGHT, IT'S TRUE!

21:46.139 --> 21:49.140
I TRICKED YOU
TO GET THE KRABBY PATTY!

21:49.142 --> 21:52.343
BUT THEN YOU SHOWED ME
FRIENDSHIP...

21:52.345 --> 21:56.447
AND NOW I REALIZE...

21:56.449 --> 21:58.582
THAT'S ALL I EVER
REALLY WANTED.

21:58.584 --> 22:00.651
REALLY?

22:00.653 --> 22:01.752
NO, NOT REALLY.

22:01.754 --> 22:03.020
BEING EVIL IS TOO MUCH FUN!

22:03.022 --> 22:06.924
Oh, darling, I knew
nothing would ever
tear us apart.

22:06.926 --> 22:08.392
(<i> ripping</i> )

22:10.129 --> 22:12.430
MR. KRABS, HE'S GONE.

22:12.432 --> 22:14.398
HE GOT THE PATTY.

22:14.400 --> 22:16.067
HE WON.

22:16.069 --> 22:18.402
HO-HO, NO,
HE DIDN'T, BOY!

22:18.404 --> 22:21.305
DON'T YOU KNOW WHAT'S
BEHIND THESE SCREENS?

22:21.307 --> 22:22.773
SOLID CONCRETE!

22:22.775 --> 22:24.442
(<i> laughing</i> )

22:24.444 --> 22:26.677
(<i> groaning</i> )

22:26.679 --> 22:28.979
I'M SORRY,
MR. KRABS

22:28.981 --> 22:31.215
I THOUGHT PLANKTON
HAD CHANGED.

22:31.217 --> 22:32.583
DON'T BLAME HIM, LAD.

22:32.585 --> 22:34.218
NO FRIENDSHIP
CAN WITHSTAND

22:34.220 --> 22:36.787
THE ALLURE OF
A KRABBY PATTY.

22:36.789 --> 22:39.657
NOW, LET'S GO BACK
TO THE KRUSTY KRAB

22:39.659 --> 22:41.892
AND HAVE A FRESH ONE,
ON ME!

22:41.894 --> 22:43.294
AYE, AYE, MR. KRABS.

22:43.296 --> 22:45.463
WELL, MAYBE
AT A DISCOUNT.

22:48.501 --> 22:49.867
HUH?

22:49.869 --> 22:53.971
