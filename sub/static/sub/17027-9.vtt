WEBVTT

00:01.602 --> 00:04.372
KARA: When I was a child,
my planet Krypton was dying.

00:04.405 --> 00:07.541
I was sent to Earth
to protect my cousin.

00:07.575 --> 00:09.510
But my pod got
knocked off-course

00:09.543 --> 00:11.412
and by the time I got here,

00:11.445 --> 00:14.682
my cousin had
already grown up
and become Superman.

00:17.185 --> 00:18.852
I hid who I really was

00:18.886 --> 00:23.157
until one day
when an accident forced me
to reveal myself to the world.

00:23.191 --> 00:26.527
To most people
I'm a reporter
at Catco Worldwide Media.

00:26.560 --> 00:30.131
But in secret, I work with my
adoptive sister for the DEO

00:30.164 --> 00:31.732
to protect my city
from alien life

00:31.765 --> 00:34.335
and anyone else
that means to cause it harm.

00:35.703 --> 00:39.207
I am Supergirl.

00:39.240 --> 00:41.142
KARA:
Previously on Supergirl...

00:41.175 --> 00:43.411
You're not gonna
go crazy on me, are you?

00:43.444 --> 00:44.445
Probably.

00:44.478 --> 00:45.679
I'm shutting you down.

00:45.713 --> 00:47.415
Roulette.

00:47.448 --> 00:49.083
Guardian has been hailed
as a hero.

00:49.117 --> 00:50.551
Yeah, I don't think the city
should be putting

00:50.584 --> 00:52.153
its trust in him so quickly.

00:52.186 --> 00:53.821
-What's wrong with us?
-JAMES: Nothing.

00:53.854 --> 00:55.456
We're heroes, man.

00:55.489 --> 00:57.458
I'm training you.
So that, one day,

00:57.491 --> 00:59.460
if you are so inclined
you can make a difference.

00:59.493 --> 01:01.329
Look, I never said
I wanted to save the world.

01:01.362 --> 01:03.264
You are so selfish.

01:05.766 --> 01:07.268
(TIRES SCREECHING)

01:14.208 --> 01:15.609
MAN: Do you see her?

01:34.895 --> 01:37.231
-Yeah! (LAUGHS)
-Yes! Yes!

01:39.367 --> 01:40.534
Faster. Faster!

01:53.781 --> 01:54.848
(MAN GROANS)

01:58.252 --> 01:59.520
Didn't you have friends?

02:03.524 --> 02:05.125
End of the line, fellas.

02:06.394 --> 02:07.528
(GRUNTING)

02:11.399 --> 02:13.133
(BOTH GRUNTING)

02:35.489 --> 02:36.857
He's coming to you.

02:36.890 --> 02:38.526
What am I supposed to...
Oh, there he is.

02:38.559 --> 02:39.560
GUARDIAN: Do something!

02:44.298 --> 02:46.267
(WINN LAUGHS)

02:46.300 --> 02:48.536
Oh, yeah baby. I did it!

02:48.569 --> 02:50.471
I did it! That was big.

02:51.239 --> 02:52.606
(GROANS)

02:53.574 --> 02:54.608
(GRUNTS)

02:56.444 --> 02:57.745
No, no, don't, no!

03:01.449 --> 03:03.451
Winn, you okay?

03:04.485 --> 03:06.454
(PANTING)

03:11.725 --> 03:13.327
(SIGHS)

03:13.361 --> 03:15.296
-Jewel thieves?
-Nabbed.

03:15.329 --> 03:16.497
I nabbed them.

03:16.530 --> 03:18.832
But, of course,
Guardian had to show up

03:18.866 --> 03:20.968
and pick up
some of the stragglers.

03:21.001 --> 03:22.836
That guy is really
starting to get on my nerves.

03:22.870 --> 03:24.238
But he did help.

03:24.272 --> 03:26.307
-That's something...
-Yeah, barely.

03:26.340 --> 03:27.841
I was the one
who had to dodge
the surface-to-air missiles.

03:27.875 --> 03:31.579
All he did
was slap cuffs on wrists.

03:31.612 --> 03:34.315
Okay, what's bothering you?
And it's not Guardian.

03:34.348 --> 03:35.716
Who says anything's
bothering me?

03:35.749 --> 03:37.718
-Crinkle.
-(GASPS) Crinkle.

03:37.751 --> 03:39.753
I'm gonna get Botox for that.

03:39.787 --> 03:40.988
If you can figure out a way
to get a needle

03:41.021 --> 03:43.324
-in my skin, I mean.
-Kara.

03:43.357 --> 03:45.393
I don't know, I just...

03:46.960 --> 03:48.629
I'm in a funk.

03:48.662 --> 03:50.331
I mean,
stopping jewel thieves?

03:50.364 --> 03:53.867
And that bank robbery
last week, it's just...

03:53.901 --> 03:55.336
It's easy.

03:55.369 --> 03:56.637
-So?
-So...

03:56.670 --> 03:59.507
So lately, I feel like
I'm protecting

03:59.540 --> 04:02.476
jewels and money
more than I'm
protecting people.

04:02.510 --> 04:06.013
You were a hero tonight,
so go home, celebrate.

04:06.046 --> 04:08.749
Do you wanna come over?
We could catch up on
The Night Of.

04:08.782 --> 04:11.385
I can't...

04:11.419 --> 04:13.487
I have plans.

04:13.521 --> 04:14.955
Unless you need me
to cancel though.

04:14.988 --> 04:16.990
No, no. I need you to go be
with your girlfriend.

04:18.726 --> 04:20.361
I can't have a...
I have a girlfriend.

04:20.394 --> 04:21.995
(LAUGHS) Go, honey.

04:34.675 --> 04:37.077
-(DOOR CLOSES)
-You're wearing my T-shirt.

04:37.110 --> 04:39.780
-Yeah, is that okay?
-That's amazing.

04:39.813 --> 04:42.049
I mean, like,
you're in my apartment

04:42.082 --> 04:45.085
and it's morning
and you slept in my apartment,

04:45.118 --> 04:46.920
and now you're wearing
my T-shirt

04:46.954 --> 04:48.789
and making coffee

04:48.822 --> 04:50.658
and I can't believe
this is happening

04:50.691 --> 04:52.660
and everything coming
out of my mouth
is very cliched.

04:52.693 --> 04:55.596
It's called being happy.
Get used to it, Danvers.

04:58.566 --> 05:00.834
I think I am
getting used to it.

05:02.570 --> 05:04.405
Oh, we're late for work.

05:04.438 --> 05:06.707
I don't care if I ever go
to work again.

05:06.740 --> 05:08.542
I mean, can't we just quit?

05:08.576 --> 05:11.679
And stay here
in this apartment forever?

05:11.712 --> 05:13.414
I don't know about forever,

05:13.447 --> 05:17.351
but maybe we can just settle
for the morning?

05:17.385 --> 05:18.952
We could call in sick...

05:18.986 --> 05:19.987
Maybe.

05:20.854 --> 05:22.456
I've got the black lung.

05:22.490 --> 05:23.924
-(ALEX COUGHS)
-The black lung.

05:30.864 --> 05:32.866
Hey, Chief,
have I got a story for you.

05:32.900 --> 05:34.568
I get five minutes to myself.

05:34.602 --> 05:36.103
Five minutes
for my coffee and Danish.

05:36.136 --> 05:37.571
It's a great story.

05:37.605 --> 05:39.106
It's actually an inside look

05:39.139 --> 05:42.843
on the jewel heist
Supergirl stopped last night.

05:42.876 --> 05:45.846
Actually, I heard the Guardian
was pretty instrumental
in stopping the heist.

05:45.879 --> 05:48.115
And I had some
free time this morning,
so I wrote a piece on it.

05:48.148 --> 05:49.883
Guardian?

05:49.917 --> 05:51.919
I mean, sure,
he picked up
Supergirl's scraps,

05:51.952 --> 05:55.656
but they were firing
missiles at Supergirl.

05:55.689 --> 05:59.760
I mean, I can't believe that
you're still team Guardian.

05:59.793 --> 06:01.862
-It's so weird.
-Why wouldn't I be?

06:01.895 --> 06:04.031
He's doing a great job.
And I...

06:04.064 --> 06:05.866
Am I wrong,
or didn't the Guardian

06:05.899 --> 06:07.134
actually catch the thieves?

06:07.167 --> 06:09.803
In the Venn diagram
of things I care about,

06:09.837 --> 06:12.039
there is coffee
and there is Danish

06:12.072 --> 06:13.674
the manna from heaven
that keeps me barely,

06:13.707 --> 06:16.577
just barely tethered
to the mortal coil.

06:26.454 --> 06:29.389
-I told you to leave me alone.
-Right, my desk is over here.

06:32.993 --> 06:35.395
-Who are you?
-I need your help.

06:39.800 --> 06:43.170
My daughter Izzy
disappeared three days ago.

06:43.203 --> 06:44.772
We had a fight.

06:44.805 --> 06:48.509
She told me that
I never trust her judgment.

06:48.542 --> 06:50.511
She slammed the door.

06:50.544 --> 06:51.845
She never came home.

06:57.718 --> 06:59.920
I put these up all over.

06:59.953 --> 07:01.589
I called her friends,
her father,

07:01.622 --> 07:03.123
no one's heard from her.

07:03.156 --> 07:06.794
The police just say that
she's a runaway.

07:06.827 --> 07:09.062
And they say there isn't
anything they can do.

07:09.096 --> 07:10.698
Your daughter ever
run away before?

07:15.235 --> 07:17.671
It was my birthday yesterday.

07:17.705 --> 07:19.439
She would've called me.

07:20.273 --> 07:22.109
I know something's wrong.

07:26.113 --> 07:29.016
We're going to get her story
out there, Ms. Williams.

07:29.049 --> 07:30.951
We're going to find
your daughter.

07:30.984 --> 07:32.886
Thank you.

07:32.920 --> 07:34.454
(MRS. WILLIAMS CRYING)

07:35.255 --> 07:36.590
Thank you.

07:39.927 --> 07:41.729
"We're going to find
your daughter"?

07:41.762 --> 07:43.831
Why would you tell her that?

07:43.864 --> 07:45.132
Because we're going
to help her.

07:47.601 --> 07:49.503
We are going
to help her, right?

07:49.537 --> 07:52.973
Teenage runaways are not news.
They are cliches.

07:53.006 --> 07:55.142
And we have
more important
stories to cover.

07:55.175 --> 07:56.977
More important...

07:57.010 --> 07:59.713
What's more important than
a mother finding her daughter?

07:59.747 --> 08:03.250
My coffee and my Danish,
and the five minutes of peace
and quiet you stole from me.

08:03.283 --> 08:04.752
(SIGHS)

08:12.893 --> 08:14.762
Excuse me?

08:14.795 --> 08:17.698
Oh, hi. Could I...
Could I just please
have a club soda?

08:20.100 --> 08:21.735
-Hey. Hi.
-Hi.

08:21.769 --> 08:22.903
Do you work here?

08:22.936 --> 08:24.037
I do.

08:24.071 --> 08:25.639
Yeah, you know
after the, um...

08:26.574 --> 08:28.609
Gosh, after the incident,

08:28.642 --> 08:31.879
they were
a little short-staffed,
so I took a job.

08:31.912 --> 08:34.281
-Mmm-hmm.
-And you know, I like alcohol.

08:34.314 --> 08:36.283
I've been known
to like alcohol.

08:36.316 --> 08:39.019
So I just really feel like
this is gonna be
a great job for me.

08:39.052 --> 08:42.289
Well, I'm glad
someone's feeling like
they fit in somewhere.

08:42.322 --> 08:44.057
Oh, that's a sad sound?

08:45.659 --> 08:48.161
You wanna tell me
what's going on? Huh?

08:48.195 --> 08:49.630
Come on, talk to me.

08:49.663 --> 08:52.766
I am a bartender now.

08:52.800 --> 08:56.904
I've just been feeling
betwixt and between of late.

08:56.937 --> 08:58.171
-Betwixt and between?
-Yes.

08:58.205 --> 09:01.308
But, a story came across
my desk today.

09:01.341 --> 09:03.310
A missing girl.

09:03.343 --> 09:05.779
I'm gonna find her.

09:05.813 --> 09:08.649
Can I offer you some
unsolicited advice?

09:08.682 --> 09:09.817
Do I?

09:09.850 --> 09:12.552
If you go looking
for trouble...

09:13.821 --> 09:14.822
Trouble...

09:16.824 --> 09:18.191
Ye shall find.

09:18.225 --> 09:22.095
Thank you for
the completely useless advice.

09:23.631 --> 09:24.998
Mmm.

09:25.032 --> 09:26.834
(EXCLAIMS IN DISGUST)
That's not club soda.

09:26.867 --> 09:29.136
Yeah, what exactly
is club soda?

09:30.170 --> 09:31.939
Not this.

09:31.972 --> 09:33.607
Thanks for meeting me.

09:33.641 --> 09:36.076
Always happy to help
a Danvers.

09:36.109 --> 09:40.080
Here is the missing persons
report on Izzy Williams
that we have,

09:40.113 --> 09:41.348
but unfortunately...

09:41.381 --> 09:42.983
-It's not that much.
-Well,

09:43.016 --> 09:44.351
any little bit helps.

09:44.384 --> 09:46.219
You know, it's funny
you asked for that.

09:46.253 --> 09:47.888
-Why?
-Well, we've just had

09:47.921 --> 09:50.390
a spike in missing persons
over the last few weeks.

09:50.423 --> 09:52.359
Do you have any theories?

09:52.392 --> 09:54.127
Serial killer? Kidnappings?

09:54.161 --> 09:57.230
Serial killers have patterns,
kidnappers have motive.

09:57.264 --> 09:58.899
But what's odd is that

09:58.932 --> 10:01.702
there's nothing to connect
these disappearances.

10:01.735 --> 10:03.771
There's Izzy Williams,
a father of four,

10:03.804 --> 10:05.739
a college student,
the list goes on.

10:05.773 --> 10:07.207
And they've all disappeared.

10:09.009 --> 10:10.277
Where are they?

10:13.814 --> 10:15.415
All righty.

10:15.448 --> 10:17.317
No problems
with your blood work?

10:17.350 --> 10:18.852
Okay.

10:18.886 --> 10:20.988
We just have
one last part of the test.

10:21.021 --> 10:22.890
All right.

10:22.923 --> 10:24.992
You stand right about here.

10:25.025 --> 10:26.393
-Right here?
-Yeah.

10:26.426 --> 10:27.627
Okay.

10:28.361 --> 10:29.863
What is that?

10:29.897 --> 10:31.131
Is that an MRI machine?

10:31.164 --> 10:32.299
Something like that.

10:33.901 --> 10:36.136
Must be a new model.

10:36.169 --> 10:39.072
What're you doing? No. No!

10:43.343 --> 10:44.778
Another perfect candidate.

10:50.183 --> 10:51.952
Always happy to help.

10:56.724 --> 10:59.359
KARA: Hey, Winn, I need you
to look at the people
on this flash drive.

10:59.392 --> 11:01.294
They're all missing.
Can you check for, uh,

11:01.328 --> 11:05.298
links between them,
their histories...

11:05.332 --> 11:07.434
Are you aware
that you're wearing
sunglasses...

11:07.467 --> 11:09.069
Indoors?

11:09.102 --> 11:12.072
The future is so very bright.

11:12.105 --> 11:14.975
-Hmm... (GASPS)
-Hey! No, no, no.

11:15.008 --> 11:18.311
-What happened to you?
-I got mugged.

11:18.345 --> 11:20.047
-It's fine.
-Why didn't you tell me?

11:20.080 --> 11:22.983
I will have that info
for you very shortly.

11:23.016 --> 11:24.818
-Hey.
-Hi.

11:25.753 --> 11:27.387
-Hi.
-Hi.

11:27.420 --> 11:29.189
-ALEX: What?
-Look at you.

11:29.222 --> 11:31.458
-What?
-Are you kidding?

11:31.491 --> 11:33.994
You look like you've been
shot with a love ray.

11:34.027 --> 11:35.829
Oh.

11:38.298 --> 11:41.134
Well, Maggie slept
over last night.

11:41.168 --> 11:42.202
Oh, my...

11:42.235 --> 11:43.837
Oh, my God!

11:43.871 --> 11:45.405
Do you think
everybody can tell?

11:45.438 --> 11:47.808
-Okay.
-Oh!

11:47.841 --> 11:49.743
Hey, what happened to you?

11:49.777 --> 11:51.845
I got mugged and I'm fine.

11:52.545 --> 11:54.281
And it hurts to smile.

11:54.314 --> 11:55.749
Okay, so there is a connection

11:55.783 --> 11:57.117
between those people
on your list.

11:57.150 --> 11:58.819
They all had blood work done

11:58.852 --> 12:00.353
a few days
before they disappeared.

12:00.387 --> 12:03.090
Blood work? That's weird.

12:03.123 --> 12:04.825
It's missing persons.
Do you want me
to come with you?

12:04.858 --> 12:06.994
No, no.
You just keep on glowing.

12:07.995 --> 12:08.996
Okay.

12:11.865 --> 12:14.167
You would not believe the size
of those mutton chops,
it was...

12:14.201 --> 12:16.369
-Hey, Kara.
-Hey...

12:16.403 --> 12:18.438
-Um...
-Wait...

12:18.471 --> 12:21.108
-What are you doing here?
-I took the day off.

12:21.141 --> 12:22.409
It's your second day.

12:22.442 --> 12:24.912
Yeah, didn't wanna overdo it.
So lunch?

12:24.945 --> 12:27.380
No, actually, I'm working.

12:27.414 --> 12:29.516
Oh, great. I'll come with you.

12:29.549 --> 12:31.852
-I... I don't think so.
-Oh, come on!

12:31.885 --> 12:33.153
Come on, it'll be fun.

12:33.186 --> 12:35.388
You wanna find
that missing girl, right?

12:35.422 --> 12:37.257
Hey, two heads are
always better than one, right?

12:37.290 --> 12:38.558
Except on the planet Barvex,

12:38.591 --> 12:39.993
because they have
two-headed cannibals.

12:40.027 --> 12:41.795
-Fine. Fine.
-Yes.

12:41.829 --> 12:44.197
Just keep your mouth shut.

12:44.231 --> 12:45.933
Have I told you
about the first time...

12:47.901 --> 12:50.037
(MIKE LAUGHS)

12:50.070 --> 12:51.538
Question, do you think
I'm more of a Goofus,

12:51.571 --> 12:53.206
-or more of a Gallant?
-Goofus.

12:56.043 --> 12:59.913
Well, well, well,
well, well. Hello.

13:00.447 --> 13:03.150
-Hi.
-Hello.

13:03.183 --> 13:06.286
They told me two strapping
young millennials
had dropped by,

13:06.319 --> 13:07.821
and here you are.

13:07.855 --> 13:12.225
Yes, we, uh,
we work out a lot.

13:12.259 --> 13:14.094
Yeah, we just wanted to, uh,

13:14.127 --> 13:15.963
get a better idea
of what you do here

13:15.996 --> 13:18.431
before jumping in.

13:18.465 --> 13:19.967
We looked at your website,

13:20.000 --> 13:22.035
it just said you can make
some quick cash.

13:22.069 --> 13:24.471
Yeah, and
we're trying to save up
for a trip to Paris city.

13:24.504 --> 13:26.306
-It's just Paris.
-Paris.

13:26.339 --> 13:28.175
Well, we're running
a clinical trial

13:28.208 --> 13:29.576
on a new-to-market supplement.

13:29.609 --> 13:32.045
-Oh!
-We're just looking to examine

13:32.079 --> 13:35.348
the effect of the supplement
on base metabolic rates.

13:35.382 --> 13:38.185
So, all we need to do is
some blood work,

13:38.218 --> 13:39.386
and we'll have you in and out,

13:39.419 --> 13:41.221
and off to Paris city
in no time.

13:41.254 --> 13:44.992
Um, well, actually,
we can't give blood.

13:45.025 --> 13:47.260
That is...
That's against our religion.

13:47.294 --> 13:50.063
Yes.
Yes, we are very religious.

13:50.097 --> 13:51.331
Very into our gods.

13:51.364 --> 13:53.133
-God.
-One God.

13:53.166 --> 13:56.203
We are madly monotheistic.

13:56.236 --> 13:59.606
Well, you both look young
and healthy enough.

13:59.639 --> 14:01.975
Let's give it
the old college try,
shall we?

14:06.246 --> 14:08.481
How did you hear
about our study?

14:08.515 --> 14:09.950
We have a recruiter,

14:09.983 --> 14:11.518
but she didn't tell me
to expect anyone today.

14:11.551 --> 14:15.622
Well, actually, a friend
of mine told us about it.

14:15.655 --> 14:19.226
It's weird, I haven't heard
from her since she came here.

14:19.259 --> 14:21.161
You, stand here.

14:21.194 --> 14:22.395
Okay. And you...

14:23.396 --> 14:25.298
Stand here.

14:25.332 --> 14:27.234
Well, maybe you remember her.

14:27.267 --> 14:28.435
Izzy Williams?

14:28.468 --> 14:30.137
Yeah, she did come
through here.

14:33.273 --> 14:34.407

14:59.299 --> 15:01.301
Go back to the DEO.

15:01.334 --> 15:02.535
I just...

15:02.569 --> 15:04.037
KARA: Tell Alex what happened

15:04.071 --> 15:05.338
and make sure a strike team
follows me.

15:05.372 --> 15:06.940
-I'm going in there.
-Right, um...

15:06.974 --> 15:07.674
We don't know
what's on the other side.

15:07.707 --> 15:09.276
Izzy's on the other side

15:09.309 --> 15:10.477
and that's all that matters.

Ahh!

15:32.332 --> 15:34.067
(GROANS) Ooh!

15:47.780 --> 15:49.582
What're you doing here?

15:49.616 --> 15:51.551
Uh, I thought you might
need my help.

15:53.220 --> 15:54.487
Hey, you're bleeding.

15:56.256 --> 15:59.459
That is a red sun.

15:59.492 --> 16:00.760
Like on Krypton and Daxam.

16:00.793 --> 16:02.362
And we get our powers
from the radiation

16:02.395 --> 16:04.464
of a yellow sun,
so that means...

16:04.497 --> 16:06.599
-No powers.
-No powers.

16:06.633 --> 16:09.169
We need to get out of here.

16:11.671 --> 16:13.373
Well, now who's gonna help us?

16:19.679 --> 16:22.615
We have to get it to work.
Nobody knows we're here!

16:22.649 --> 16:25.018
That's why I told you
to get my sister.

16:25.052 --> 16:26.353
You know what?
It doesn't matter
who's to blame.

16:26.386 --> 16:27.754
We just need to get back
to Earth.

16:27.787 --> 16:29.489
Aliens brought those people
to this planet,

16:29.522 --> 16:32.025
and we're gonna find out why
and save them.

16:32.059 --> 16:33.626
Um, could you maybe
just think about

16:33.660 --> 16:34.761
saving us for a second?

16:34.794 --> 16:36.229
No one told you to come here.

16:36.263 --> 16:39.099
In fact, I specifically
told you to not come.

16:39.132 --> 16:40.633
Okay, and let's say
we do find them.

16:40.667 --> 16:43.303
-The portal is closed.
-We'll figure something out.

16:43.336 --> 16:45.205
-(DISTANT WHIRRING)
-What's that?

16:46.573 --> 16:48.408
Sounds like
a short-range shuttle.

16:50.443 --> 16:52.379
That's a troop transport.

16:52.412 --> 16:54.581
-Where is it going?
-It's probably headed there.

16:57.584 --> 16:59.652
-Yeah, so we're going...
-After it.

16:59.686 --> 17:01.654
No. No, No, No.

17:01.688 --> 17:03.656
We are going away
from Murder Castle

17:03.690 --> 17:05.825
because we don't have
our powers anymore.

17:05.858 --> 17:07.060
And?

17:09.162 --> 17:10.163
Right.

17:13.700 --> 17:14.701
All right.

17:16.436 --> 17:17.570

17:22.342 --> 17:24.411
I got a real nice
and easy 10-37

17:24.444 --> 17:26.179
come over
the scanner last night,

17:26.213 --> 17:28.681
and the cops still haven't
found the suspicious vehicle.

17:28.715 --> 17:30.750
So I was, um...

17:30.783 --> 17:32.685
Just wondering
if you wanted to...

17:32.719 --> 17:34.354
I actually thought that

17:34.387 --> 17:36.556
just maybe you came
to check up on me.

17:36.589 --> 17:39.159
Dude, I came all the way
out here because

17:39.192 --> 17:42.229
-I knew you were upset.
-Yeah, yeah. I'm upset.

17:42.262 --> 17:43.563
You know, I almost got killed.

17:43.596 --> 17:45.098

their ass kicked.

17:45.132 --> 17:46.299
-Just stop.
-Winn, let me help...

17:46.333 --> 17:47.667
Just stop!

17:54.207 --> 17:55.475
I'm good here, maybe.

17:55.508 --> 17:57.577
Or you know, at a desk,
but I can't go out there

17:57.610 --> 17:59.379
with you again.
I can't, all right?

17:59.412 --> 18:01.214
-Just stop. I can't. I quit.

18:04.217 --> 18:05.318
Am I interrupting
something?

18:05.352 --> 18:07.620
No, no, we're good. Just um...

18:07.654 --> 18:09.256
-What's up?
-Have either of you

18:09.289 --> 18:10.757
heard from Kara?
She's not answering her phone.

18:10.790 --> 18:12.192
Isn't she's supposed
to be on a story?

18:12.225 --> 18:13.626
Yeah, missing persons.

18:13.660 --> 18:15.628
Okay, just text me
the details.

18:22.502 --> 18:25.372
You know how on Earth
they rate everything?

18:25.405 --> 18:28.375
One-star. This is a one-star.

18:28.408 --> 18:31.778
I used to love going to
other planets with my parents.

18:31.811 --> 18:33.780
They'd take me
to the pretty ones, though.

18:33.813 --> 18:35.482
Not like this.

18:35.515 --> 18:37.650
We'd spend solstices
on Sedenach...

18:37.684 --> 18:39.886
-Oh, yeah.
The Bismuth mountains?
-Yeah.

18:39.919 --> 18:42.355
Yeah, they'd grow
right underneath our feet.

18:42.389 --> 18:46.626
-Yeah.
-It's all those crystal
staircases raising us up.

-What?

18:54.801 --> 18:57.537
Oh, come on,
now you won't follow me?

18:57.570 --> 19:00.473
Um, I can't. My leg is stuck.

Oh, no. I know that tone.
That's a bad news tone.

her through portal.

to the Red Fortress

carbon forms like you.

them as slaves.

is a reporter and...

persuaded her to find out

22:18.070 --> 22:20.473
what happened to you.
And she told me,
that's why I'm here.

22:20.507 --> 22:22.475
You can save us.
You can just knock down

of the intergalactic

-Define worse.

22:58.911 --> 23:01.614
Arcturus is a red sun.

23:01.648 --> 23:03.049
So she won't have
any of her powers?

23:06.519 --> 23:08.488
I should have gone with her.
Why didn't I go with her?

23:08.521 --> 23:09.822
You didn't know this was
gonna happen, Alex.

23:09.856 --> 23:12.024
Hey, we have
the Martian Manhunter, right?

23:12.058 --> 23:14.160
He doesn't need a yellow sun.
He'll go in there,

23:14.193 --> 23:15.628
and he'll get her,
and everything be okay.

23:15.662 --> 23:17.029
I can't join
this rescue mission.

23:17.063 --> 23:19.899
Exactly. Wait, what?

23:19.932 --> 23:22.201
The air on Maaldoria
is toxic to Martians.

23:22.234 --> 23:24.070
Some kind of silicate
in the atmosphere.

23:25.572 --> 23:27.540
I can't help Kara, I'm sorry.

23:34.113 --> 23:35.982
Hey, what are you doing here?

23:36.015 --> 23:37.650
You weren't returning
my texts or calls.

23:37.684 --> 23:41.187
-I was worried.
-I've been busy. I'm sorry.

23:41.220 --> 23:44.924
-Is this a bad time?
-Yeah, it is, kind of.

23:44.957 --> 23:47.594
-Supergirl's missing.
-If anyone can find her,
it's you.

23:47.627 --> 23:49.862
I knew this was gonna happen.
I knew it.

23:49.896 --> 23:50.997
What are you talking about?

23:51.030 --> 23:53.132
I was happy
for, like, five minutes.

23:53.165 --> 23:54.667
-What?
-I'm sorry.

23:54.701 --> 23:55.968
This was a mistake.

23:56.002 --> 23:58.070
I'm sorry, you have to go.

23:58.104 --> 23:59.839
I'm sorry, I can't...

24:03.009 --> 24:04.443
Okay.

24:05.277 --> 24:06.613
Got it. See you, Danvers.

24:09.782 --> 24:12.552
Well, if this isn't deja vu.

24:12.585 --> 24:14.587
-Why are you here?
-Yeah.

24:15.788 --> 24:17.957
Wait, who is this?

24:17.990 --> 24:19.692
I'm here because of you.

24:19.726 --> 24:21.728
You dismantled my club.

24:21.761 --> 24:23.996
I had nowhere else to go.

24:24.030 --> 24:28.568
So imagine my excitement
when one of my fighters
told me about Slavers' Moon.

24:28.601 --> 24:31.137
I jumped at the opportunity
to help expand its market.

24:31.170 --> 24:32.905
You are treating this like...

24:34.140 --> 24:36.042
Like you're selling coffee!

24:36.075 --> 24:38.978
You are selling people!

24:39.011 --> 24:42.114
I've taken human trafficking
to the next level.

24:42.148 --> 24:43.850
These are prime specimens

24:43.883 --> 24:45.885
that can survive
a lifetime of labor.

24:45.918 --> 24:49.656
They're good stock.
And they'll sell
for top dollar.

24:49.689 --> 24:53.125
-Blood money.
-Blood diamonds, actually.

24:53.159 --> 24:54.727
This planet's lousy with them.

24:54.761 --> 24:57.229
They're like dirt
to these Maaldorians.

25:03.936 --> 25:06.005
Oh, man, I hate these guys.

25:06.038 --> 25:08.174
(SPEAKING ALIEN DIALECT)

25:09.776 --> 25:11.611
Good news, everybody.

25:11.644 --> 25:13.079
You've all been sold.

25:19.051 --> 25:21.287
We only had time
to fabricate the one.

25:21.320 --> 25:22.889
It won't last long.
So make it count.

25:22.922 --> 25:25.658
-I will.
-Bring our girl home.

25:27.193 --> 25:28.761
Winn.

25:28.795 --> 25:30.630
Okay, so this should open

25:30.663 --> 25:32.031
the transmat
on the other side.

25:32.064 --> 25:35.067
Yeah, well, keep it.
You're coming with me.

25:35.101 --> 25:37.904
No, um, yeah, this is,
it's pre-programed.

25:37.937 --> 25:39.639
Uh, so you just hit the button

25:39.672 --> 25:41.107
and you're thinking
with portals, right?

25:41.140 --> 25:42.909
-You don't need me.
-Yeah, no.

25:42.942 --> 25:44.777
I want your hands
at the controls.

25:44.811 --> 25:47.179
No, no.

25:47.213 --> 25:49.181
Agent Schott,
she wasn't asking you.

25:49.215 --> 25:51.951
-That's an order.
-I'm sorry...

25:55.722 --> 25:58.057
ALEX: Winn.

25:58.090 --> 26:00.593
I'm not gonna be of any help
to you out there.

26:00.627 --> 26:01.628
I mean...

26:03.129 --> 26:06.198
Okay fine, this,
I wasn't mugged.

26:06.232 --> 26:10.136
All right, I was trying
to help Guardian and I...

26:10.169 --> 26:12.071
If he'd showed up
two seconds later,
I don't...

26:12.104 --> 26:13.205
Hey,

26:13.239 --> 26:14.674
Kara needs you.

26:14.707 --> 26:18.377
-Okay? I need you
-I'm scared.

26:18.410 --> 26:21.280
You don't think
I was afraid the first time
I went out in the field?

26:22.281 --> 26:23.850
Dude, I was terrified.

26:25.718 --> 26:27.787
But nobody gets better
by running away.

26:32.058 --> 26:34.727
Okay, listen. I know that
you're all scared.

26:34.761 --> 26:37.830
But we're going to find
a way out of here.
Don't worry.

26:37.864 --> 26:38.865
MIKE: Psst!

26:40.032 --> 26:42.001
-Did you just "Psst"?
-Yeah.

26:42.869 --> 26:45.237
Come here.

26:45.271 --> 26:47.106
So, we're stuck
in the most dangerous planet

26:47.139 --> 26:48.841

26:48.875 --> 26:52.745
We don't have our powers,
and you're optimistic how?

26:52.779 --> 26:54.313
Because they need us to be.

26:54.346 --> 26:55.982
See, this is what I've been
telling you.

26:56.015 --> 26:57.717
Kara, you know,
if you go looking for trouble,

26:57.750 --> 26:59.051
you will always find it.

26:59.085 --> 27:01.053
And you do.
You're like the winner at it.

27:01.087 --> 27:04.256
That's what heroes do.
They fight.

27:04.290 --> 27:05.792
They don't sit
and hide in a bar

27:05.825 --> 27:07.259
because it's easier
than getting involved.

27:07.293 --> 27:10.129
I'm not hiding,
I'm being smart.

27:10.162 --> 27:12.031
It's a dangerous universe.

27:12.064 --> 27:13.265
And why do you have
to be the one

27:13.299 --> 27:14.667
who saves everyone every time?

27:14.701 --> 27:16.769
Because our worlds
may have been destroyed,

27:16.803 --> 27:18.671
but we were spared
for a reason.

27:18.705 --> 27:21.040
-Ah, luck.
-I refuse to believe that.

27:21.073 --> 27:23.876

on another world,

27:25.344 --> 27:27.013
whether or not
you have your powers,

27:27.046 --> 27:28.080
you never give in.

between you and me.

36:40.332 --> 36:41.633
I almost didn't.

36:43.602 --> 36:44.836
I just... I don't...

36:44.870 --> 36:45.971
I don't think
you're ready for this.

36:46.004 --> 36:47.639
No. No, no, no, I am.

36:47.673 --> 36:50.976
I am. Hey, I just...

36:51.009 --> 36:52.878
I just went kind of
went crazy and...

36:54.346 --> 36:55.847
I just...

36:55.881 --> 36:57.583
I feel like the universe

36:57.616 --> 37:00.619
is just magically smacking me
down from being happy.

37:01.887 --> 37:02.954
That's it?

37:04.390 --> 37:05.691
You gotta give me
more than that.

37:07.626 --> 37:10.996
I have always felt
so responsible.

37:11.029 --> 37:15.334
Like,
weight of the world
responsible.

37:15.367 --> 37:17.336
And my parents
always relied on me

37:17.369 --> 37:18.470
to watch over my sister,

37:18.504 --> 37:19.805
so the few times

37:19.838 --> 37:21.907
that I've ever did anything
for myself,

37:21.940 --> 37:24.576
it ended badly.

37:26.378 --> 37:27.746
And then Supergirl
went missing

37:27.779 --> 37:29.481
and I just,
I blew a gasket and...

37:29.515 --> 37:30.982
Because Supergirl's
your sister.

37:33.419 --> 37:34.786
What are you talking about?

37:35.687 --> 37:37.022
Come on.

37:37.055 --> 37:38.790
Look, I know you.

37:38.824 --> 37:41.560
The only person you get
that torn up over is Kara.

37:44.062 --> 37:45.631
Plus, the glasses don't help.

37:45.664 --> 37:48.334
I always said that too.
It's kind of ridiculous.

37:54.072 --> 37:58.410
I'm... I'm glad that you know.

37:58.444 --> 38:00.879
Because I don't, I don't want
there to be any secrets.

38:03.815 --> 38:05.817
Bad stuff happens.

38:05.851 --> 38:09.521
In our line of work,
it happens all the time.

38:09.555 --> 38:11.790
How do I know you're not
gonna run next time it does?

38:11.823 --> 38:13.291
I won't.

38:14.960 --> 38:16.428
I'm sorry.

38:18.029 --> 38:20.031
I just wanna be happy

38:20.766 --> 38:21.967
with you.

38:24.970 --> 38:27.005
You get one, Alex.

38:28.440 --> 38:29.708
Understood.

38:30.976 --> 38:32.310
(SIGHS)

38:33.579 --> 38:34.746
Thank you.

38:37.716 --> 38:38.917
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

38:41.453 --> 38:43.822
-Hi.
-Club soda?

38:43.855 --> 38:45.957
-I see, thank you.
-I found it.

38:45.991 --> 38:48.360
You look cozy and comfortable.

38:48.394 --> 38:49.695
Well, I am.

38:49.728 --> 38:51.697
So you still feeling
betwixt and between?

38:51.730 --> 38:54.566
-No, no, I feel amazing.
-Good, good.

38:54.600 --> 38:56.568
So what brings you by?

38:56.602 --> 39:00.338
Oh, you know, some shopping...

39:01.072 --> 39:03.709
A little evening stroll.

39:03.742 --> 39:05.844
No, I, um...

39:05.877 --> 39:07.613
(CLEARS THROAT) There we are.

39:09.481 --> 39:11.116
I was wrong.

39:11.149 --> 39:12.584
That's what I wanted to...

39:12.618 --> 39:14.052
About?

39:14.085 --> 39:16.121
Because the list of things
you were wrong about is,

39:16.154 --> 39:17.989
-is, it's long.
-Yes, long list.

39:18.023 --> 39:20.091
Um, I...

39:20.959 --> 39:22.994
About getting involved.

39:23.028 --> 39:25.363
And then I saw you
with those people and...

39:27.165 --> 39:29.601
There wasn't much
to inspire me on Daxam.

39:29.635 --> 39:32.103
-What about the Prince?
-He wasn't worth admiring.

39:33.439 --> 39:35.607
But I wanna be.

39:35.641 --> 39:37.909
So that's the next thing.

39:39.177 --> 39:41.146
I've made a decision...

39:41.179 --> 39:44.049
-Sounds decisive.
-It's very decisive.

39:47.653 --> 39:48.920
I wanna be a superhero.

39:49.921 --> 39:51.490
-Say what?
-Like you.

39:51.523 --> 39:54.893
With a name and an outfit,
maybe a cape.

39:54.926 --> 39:57.429
-You want the suit.
-No. No.

39:57.463 --> 39:58.897
I mean, yes.

39:58.930 --> 40:01.433
I want the suit, but no, no,
I wanna...

40:01.467 --> 40:03.201
I wanna get my hands dirty,
you know, like...

40:03.234 --> 40:04.703
I wanna do something.

40:06.071 --> 40:09.107
-You're serious?
-Yeah.

40:09.140 --> 40:11.176
If you take this road,
easy is over.

40:11.209 --> 40:12.911
Well, I don't want easy.

40:12.944 --> 40:14.480
-Cape can get heavy sometime.
-I want a heavy cape.

40:15.814 --> 40:17.549
Come on.

40:20.218 --> 40:21.587
I wanna help you

40:22.488 --> 40:23.822
keep the world spinning.

40:25.223 --> 40:27.092
To prove that
I was spared for a reason.

40:29.094 --> 40:30.862
You're gonna have
to listen to me...

40:31.763 --> 40:34.700
(TUTS) Pfft.

40:36.234 --> 40:38.670
I will listen to you.

40:38.704 --> 40:40.205
I will, I will.

40:40.238 --> 40:41.940
This time I will.

40:41.973 --> 40:44.209
Well, you got
me something,

40:44.242 --> 40:45.711
it's funny.

40:45.744 --> 40:46.945
I got you something, too.

40:46.978 --> 40:48.580
-You got me something?
-Yes.

40:52.117 --> 40:54.252
What's that?

40:54.285 --> 40:58.890
-Wow! For me? My very own?
-Mmm-hmm! Mmm-hmm.

41:00.759 --> 41:01.860
Can I ask why?

41:04.295 --> 41:06.097
Yesterday, you were

41:06.131 --> 41:09.000
a little less Goofus,

41:09.034 --> 41:10.869
and a little more Gallant.

41:12.638 --> 41:15.006
You noticed?
I'll take it.

41:21.012 --> 41:23.649
(MACHINES SPARKING)

41:35.661 --> 41:36.795
May I help you?

41:39.798 --> 41:41.667
He's not here. He left.

41:41.700 --> 41:43.535
Where?

41:43.569 --> 41:45.671
Where is Mon-El of Daxam?

41:45.704 --> 41:47.939
Earth. He's gone to Earth.

41:50.776 --> 41:51.710
No!
