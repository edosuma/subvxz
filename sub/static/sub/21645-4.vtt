WEBVTT

00:54.400 --> 00:56.915
Your Majesty!

00:58.200 --> 01:00.317
Your Majesty...

01:00.480 --> 01:02.199
Is that really necessary?

01:04.720 --> 01:06.757
- No! No!
- You'll be fine, you'll be fine...

01:06.920 --> 01:09.071
Victoria. Victoria, look at me. Look at me.

01:09.240 --> 01:12.517
Look at me. It will be
over soon, I promise.

01:12.680 --> 01:15.354
- I promise.
- You're going to be fine.

01:15.520 --> 01:17.113
You'll be fine.

01:26.520 --> 01:28.512
Gentlemen...

01:29.720 --> 01:31.712
.. we have a Prince of Wales.

01:39.360 --> 01:41.352
Isn't he beautiful?

01:46.840 --> 01:48.832
All babies look like frogs to me.

02:06.560 --> 02:09.711
Ah, guten Abend, meine Lieben.

02:12.600 --> 02:14.592
Liebchen...

04:12.000 --> 04:15.072
It's Her Majesty's senior dresser,
as I live and breathe.

04:15.240 --> 04:17.516
Welcome to our humble abode.

04:18.279 --> 04:20.954
I came as soon as I could.
You said it was urgent.

04:22.079 --> 04:23.958
It's not...?

04:24.120 --> 04:28.831
No, she's better now.
The doctor gave her some medicine.

04:29.000 --> 04:31.390
Thank God.

04:31.560 --> 04:33.836
Ssh. It's all right, Emily. It's all right.

04:36.480 --> 04:38.358
<i>This is my medicine.</i>

04:38.520 --> 04:40.512
Is that right?

04:44.920 --> 04:46.400
What is it that you want, Eliza?

04:47.960 --> 04:50.839
I wonder, when I have so much.

04:53.000 --> 04:55.117
The Prince has put up our wages.

04:56.840 --> 04:58.479
So...

04:59.480 --> 05:01.233
.. there's a bit more than usual.

05:03.880 --> 05:05.758
Aren't I the lucky one?

05:11.440 --> 05:15.275
What a strong face you have, my little man.

05:16.560 --> 05:18.552
You will be king one day, you know.

05:21.680 --> 05:23.672
Albert...

05:32.400 --> 05:36.235
As your dear father said about you,
plump as a partridge.

05:36.400 --> 05:37.629
Hm.

05:42.400 --> 05:44.278
The boy Jones.

05:44.440 --> 05:46.716
It's in the Morning Chronicle. Right there.

05:49.120 --> 05:51.396
He didn't go to the papers himself,
did he, Mr Penge?

05:51.560 --> 05:53.119
No, but someone else did.

05:53.280 --> 05:57.399
And whoever it was is a traitor
to Queen and country.

06:00.720 --> 06:02.951
The informant must be in the household.

06:03.120 --> 06:05.032
Why would anyone be doing that?

06:14.400 --> 06:17.711
See, now it has been
advertised to the entire world

06:17.880 --> 06:20.315
that the palace is not safe.

06:20.480 --> 06:22.472
Not safe?

06:23.920 --> 06:25.479
He was just a little boy, Albert.

06:25.640 --> 06:28.519
Our family is entitled to its privacy.

06:30.320 --> 06:32.551
From Coburg, Your Royal Highness.

07:06.520 --> 07:08.318
Albert?

07:14.280 --> 07:16.272
Your father?

07:22.640 --> 07:25.439
I have to make the necessary arrangements.

07:36.560 --> 07:38.438
Drummond.

07:38.600 --> 07:41.115
What brings you to this
corner of the palace?

07:43.920 --> 07:45.912
A dark day for the Prince.

07:46.920 --> 07:49.435
I wonder if the Queen might
accompany him to the funeral.

07:49.600 --> 07:54.038
I think not. The Queen has
been... out of sorts since the birth.

07:54.200 --> 07:57.113
I would have thought she'd be happy
to have secured an heir.

07:58.160 --> 08:01.836
I suppose we shall never understand
the fairer sex, will we?

08:05.400 --> 08:07.960
As I'm sure you know,
I leave for Coburg this afternoon.

08:08.680 --> 08:11.036
In my absence,
I am relying on you to find out

08:11.200 --> 08:14.034
who informed the Morning Chronicle
about the palace intruder.

08:14.200 --> 08:17.955
But it could have been
any of the palace staff.

08:18.120 --> 08:20.794
There are hundreds of them.
How could I possibly find out...

08:20.960 --> 08:24.510
I am relying on you, Baroness,
to find the culprit.

08:26.400 --> 08:29.757
Otherwise all of the staff here
will have to be replaced.

08:31.200 --> 08:35.352
You included. The Royal household
must be trustworthy.

08:36.360 --> 08:38.352
Yes, Your Royal Highness.

08:39.679 --> 08:44.152
One of you has sold this private
information to the public.

08:45.200 --> 08:48.398
I will find out who has
betrayed the Queen's trust.

08:49.000 --> 08:51.356
If you know anything
about who did this,

08:51.520 --> 08:53.955
it is your obligation to tell me.

08:55.280 --> 08:57.078
Immediately.

09:15.120 --> 09:16.998
Where have you been?

09:17.160 --> 09:19.311
Nowhere in particular.

09:21.080 --> 09:23.470
I've asked Lehzen to prepare
my trunks for Coburg.

09:24.640 --> 09:26.074
Oh, my love, I...

09:26.240 --> 09:28.232
I think I should travel alone.

09:28.960 --> 09:31.429
We've never spent a night apart
since we married.

09:31.600 --> 09:33.831
I fear it is too soon
after your confinement.

09:34.000 --> 09:35.832
But I want to be with you.

09:36.000 --> 09:39.835
Victoria, you have not quite been
yourself since the baby arrived.

09:41.200 --> 09:44.113
I do not want you to make
such a melancholy journey.

09:45.240 --> 09:47.232
Stay here with the children.

09:48.160 --> 09:49.753
Recover your strength.

10:13.320 --> 10:14.754
I wish I could go with him.

10:14.920 --> 10:17.310
He will manage without you, Majesty.

10:20.880 --> 10:22.872
I know he will.

10:33.560 --> 10:35.756
- Oh!
- I am sorry.

10:35.920 --> 10:38.435
No. No, no, no. My fault.

10:41.040 --> 10:43.953
You are looking prosperous
these days. Is that real gold?

10:44.120 --> 10:46.999
Well... do I seem like the kind of
man who'd wear pinchbeck?

10:48.400 --> 10:51.677
No. I think you'd prefer
the genuine article.

10:51.840 --> 10:54.036
You're right there, Nancy.

11:11.680 --> 11:13.797
I didn't know what to expect.

11:13.960 --> 11:16.111
He looks so calm.

11:16.280 --> 11:18.590
More than he ever did when he was alive.

11:21.680 --> 11:25.879
I- I received a letter
from him the day before.

11:26.040 --> 11:27.918
Was he asking for money?

11:28.080 --> 11:30.675
He was asking me to name
the baby after him.

11:32.520 --> 11:34.591
But it was too late.

11:34.760 --> 11:37.116
You chose the right name
for your son, Albert.

11:42.160 --> 11:44.152
I came as soon as I could.

11:48.720 --> 11:51.633
We are orphans now, you and I.

11:51.800 --> 11:54.918
Not quite orphans, my dear boys.

11:55.080 --> 11:56.878
Uncle Leopold.

12:13.720 --> 12:15.598
Vicky, why must you always be moving?

12:15.760 --> 12:18.594
Children of her age have little
understanding, ma'am.

12:20.000 --> 12:21.593
I know.

12:23.400 --> 12:26.120
Look, ma'am, little
Prince Albert is smiling.

12:31.320 --> 12:32.959
Lehzen.

12:33.120 --> 12:35.112
Has the mail arrived from Coburg?

12:36.280 --> 12:37.794
It usually takes a week, ma'am.

12:37.960 --> 12:40.919
Never mind, ma'am.
As my late husband used to say,

12:41.080 --> 12:42.912
absence makes the heart grow fonder.

12:46.040 --> 12:48.600
<i>Mysonisafinefellow.</i>

12:50.000 --> 12:54.870
Victoria, usually she wishes
to be a part of everything,

12:55.040 --> 12:58.556
but now it is as if she does
not care any more.

12:58.720 --> 13:00.598
You miss the fighting?

13:00.760 --> 13:02.752
I miss her spirit.

13:06.080 --> 13:08.072
That tree.

13:09.680 --> 13:11.558
This seems familiar.

13:11.720 --> 13:13.632
I dared you to climb up it.

13:13.800 --> 13:15.314
Did I?

13:15.480 --> 13:16.960
You took some persuading.

13:17.120 --> 13:19.510
Papa had forbidden it.

13:20.920 --> 13:23.594
The last time I spoke with him, Ernest...

13:24.880 --> 13:26.872
.. I was not kind.

13:29.480 --> 13:31.472
For that to be the last time...

13:33.520 --> 13:35.512
Did anyone tell you how he died?

13:35.680 --> 13:37.080
Seizure.

13:38.160 --> 13:41.597
It was more... interesting than that.

13:43.800 --> 13:47.953
You see, he was in the arms
of his dearest friend, Liesel.

13:50.720 --> 13:52.598
You should be pleased, Albert.

13:52.760 --> 13:55.070
He died doing what he loved.

14:04.680 --> 14:07.798
Mr Brunel's tunnel
has taken over 20 years to build.

14:07.960 --> 14:11.397
When opened, it will make crossing
the Thames infinitely quicker.

14:13.440 --> 14:17.514
I expect you would like to attend an event
of such national significance, ma'am?

14:17.680 --> 14:19.399
I...

14:22.240 --> 14:23.515
I can't.

14:26.520 --> 14:29.194
Perhaps you might take a look
at this, ma'am?

14:39.600 --> 14:41.671
What are all those people
doing down there?

14:43.680 --> 14:46.149
They are walking beneath the water, ma'am.

14:59.040 --> 15:00.269
Well!

15:01.280 --> 15:02.953
I shall keep it.

15:04.760 --> 15:08.151
Nonetheless, I... I cannot attend.

15:42.520 --> 15:45.638
So this is why you're always
too busy to see me.

15:47.720 --> 15:49.757
I'm surprised you're not in the nursery.

15:54.240 --> 15:57.597
When you were a child, I could
never bear to be apart from you.

16:00.800 --> 16:02.712
Babies are so easy to love.

17:17.680 --> 17:19.751
I told you in confidence, Eliza.

17:19.920 --> 17:21.718
No such thing, Nancy.

17:21.880 --> 17:23.439
No such thing.

17:24.880 --> 17:29.318
I care more about putting shoes on
her feet than keeping your secrets.

17:30.160 --> 17:32.516
If this is traced back to
me, I'll lose my place.

17:32.680 --> 17:35.514
Then you should have kept
your mouth shut, Nancy.

17:53.400 --> 17:55.437
Your mother was so young.

17:55.600 --> 17:57.319
So lovely.

17:59.320 --> 18:01.198
And so unhappy.

18:01.360 --> 18:02.760
Hm.

18:03.800 --> 18:06.599
Well, she would have to be,
to leave her children behind.

18:06.760 --> 18:09.400
My brother was not an
easy man to live with.

18:11.080 --> 18:16.235
And I... did my best to be a friend to her.

18:18.080 --> 18:21.437
A friend? What kind of friend?

18:23.880 --> 18:28.318
I... had just lost my beloved Charlotte.

18:30.040 --> 18:36.514
And your father left her all alone here
with your brother and so...

18:38.240 --> 18:40.232
.. we comforted one another.

18:42.360 --> 18:43.794
Comforted?

18:43.960 --> 18:47.271
Poor Louise needed love so badly.

18:49.320 --> 18:52.518
And then... after you were born...

18:53.960 --> 18:56.395
.. my destiny took me to Belgium

18:56.560 --> 19:01.351
and... your mother,
she went in a different direction.

19:08.240 --> 19:09.993
Good night.

19:10.880 --> 19:12.519
Good night, Uncle.

20:12.000 --> 20:15.152
Cousin Ferdinand has grown
out of all recognition.

20:15.320 --> 20:18.757
At least the pimples have abated,
thank goodness.

20:20.120 --> 20:23.397
Uncle Leopold is trying to marry him
off to the Spanish Queen.

20:25.720 --> 20:29.077
Well, I'm... I'm surprised he's not
tried to marry you off yet.

20:29.240 --> 20:32.119
Oh, you underestimate him.

20:32.280 --> 20:36.672
Princess Alda of Oldenburg
arrived this very afternoon.

20:42.520 --> 20:45.433
- Your Majesty.
- Welcome to Rosenau.

20:45.600 --> 20:48.195
I trust you had a pleasant journey?

20:48.360 --> 20:49.714
Not really.

20:49.880 --> 20:52.475
The roads in Coburg are most uncivilised.

21:14.200 --> 21:18.399
How do you find our Coburg wine, Princess?

21:18.560 --> 21:20.119
It is too strong for me.

21:20.280 --> 21:24.354
Perhaps you would like to play cards
after luncheon?

21:24.520 --> 21:26.159
I do not gamble.

21:28.480 --> 21:30.199
Would you like to go riding tomorrow?

21:30.360 --> 21:32.272
I will be at church.

21:33.480 --> 21:34.994
Ja.

21:55.560 --> 21:57.870
The Prime Minister and Mr Drummond,
Your Majesty.

21:58.040 --> 21:59.633
- Sir Robert.
- Ma'am.

22:01.560 --> 22:04.871
- I was not expecting you.
- Forgive the intrusion, Your Majesty.

22:05.960 --> 22:08.031
I'm afraid this is an urgent matter.

22:09.360 --> 22:13.036
There has been an explosion
at the Tower in the Armoury.

22:13.200 --> 22:15.351
Five men have lost their lives.

22:15.520 --> 22:17.398
Many others have been injured.

22:19.280 --> 22:21.272
I will send my condolences.

22:23.400 --> 22:24.959
Given the scale of the disaster,

22:25.120 --> 22:28.192
it would be better for you
to attend the hospital in person.

22:31.160 --> 22:32.958
In person?

22:34.240 --> 22:36.118
- I'm not sure that I...
- Ma'am.

22:38.480 --> 22:40.836
I strongly advise you to attend.

23:08.000 --> 23:10.390
I offer my sincere condolences.

23:31.560 --> 23:37.477
Your Majesty,
I called... my daughter after you.

23:42.160 --> 23:45.756
Then, she is lucky to have
such a brave father.

23:49.000 --> 23:51.196
May I escort you to your carriage, ma'am?

24:06.880 --> 24:09.031
That must have been distressing
for you, ma'am,

24:09.200 --> 24:13.035
but I know your presence made all
the difference to those poor souls.

24:23.240 --> 24:25.835
Mr Francatelli, I wanted to talk to you.

24:27.040 --> 24:28.520
Flattered, Baroness.

24:28.680 --> 24:31.718
I've noticed that since you have
returned to the palace,

24:31.880 --> 24:33.792
you have looked much smarter.

24:33.960 --> 24:35.758
I'm glad you approve.

24:37.520 --> 24:39.716
If that is all, I must
return to my soufflÃ©s.

24:39.880 --> 24:42.190
They wait for no one,
not even the Queen herself.

24:42.360 --> 24:45.512
I was wondering how you afford
these new items.

24:48.400 --> 24:50.676
Perhaps I have a fairy godmother, Baroness.

25:08.080 --> 25:10.675
Albert? Can it really be you?

25:10.840 --> 25:12.957
I had to get out of the palace.

25:13.120 --> 25:15.874
And you haven't even tried
talking to Princess Alda.

25:17.520 --> 25:19.557
- Ernest...
- Are you going to lecture me

25:19.720 --> 25:22.713
about the dangers of the demon drink?

25:25.800 --> 25:28.793
This is my tribute to Papa.

25:30.000 --> 25:32.071
One that he would have appreciated.

25:35.480 --> 25:36.630
You're right.

25:37.520 --> 25:40.638
Let's drink to Papa now.

25:48.840 --> 25:50.911
Before you retire, ma'am...

25:54.480 --> 25:58.554
.. I would like to congratulate you
on your conduct today.

26:00.520 --> 26:03.911
You want to congratulate me on my conduct?

26:04.080 --> 26:07.437
I thought the whole
occasion a great success.

26:07.600 --> 26:10.718
It was time you showed yourself in public.

26:11.320 --> 26:13.960
Yes. Yes, I suppose it was.

26:14.120 --> 26:16.430
And in the circumstances,

26:16.600 --> 26:20.355
your display of emotion
was entirely appropriate.

26:20.520 --> 26:23.035
I was crying for them, of course.

26:24.040 --> 26:25.713
But I was also crying for myself.

26:25.880 --> 26:27.633
I know.

26:29.760 --> 26:34.039
You're not the only woman who has felt herself
in low spirits after the birth of a child.

26:34.200 --> 26:37.989
I experienced something similar
after the birth of my daughter, Mary.

26:38.720 --> 26:43.237
And yet I only had an estate to oversee,
not a country.

26:45.440 --> 26:47.432
The birth...

26:50.120 --> 26:52.112
The birth was very distressing.

26:55.040 --> 26:56.793
Nothing has become easier since.

26:56.960 --> 26:58.474
But it will.

26:59.600 --> 27:02.479
I know how hard it was for you
to go out today.

27:02.640 --> 27:07.840
But I also know that tomorrow...
it will be easier.

27:09.080 --> 27:10.958
I hope you are right, Duchess.

27:11.120 --> 27:13.430
There can be no doubt about it, ma'am.

27:27.200 --> 27:28.919
Such a shame no one wanted to join us.

27:29.080 --> 27:32.073
What are we going to talk about?

27:37.880 --> 27:39.633
Oh, I'm sorry.

27:39.800 --> 27:41.792
I think I left my volume of Chopin in here.

27:41.960 --> 27:43.553
Oh, Miss Coke.

27:45.040 --> 27:47.032
Please, why don't you come and join us?

27:51.000 --> 27:52.957
- Any news from Coburg?
- No.

27:53.120 --> 27:57.080
I wonder how Prince Ernest is
finding his new life as the Duke.

27:57.240 --> 27:58.959
Hopefully better than his father.

28:00.120 --> 28:02.271
I suppose he will have to find a bride.

28:10.040 --> 28:13.351
But life is... it's all about balance.

28:14.640 --> 28:16.871
- Balance?
- That's correct.

28:19.280 --> 28:21.556
You can achieve anything...

28:22.760 --> 28:23.989
.. if you have...

28:25.800 --> 28:28.599
.. perfect... equilibrium.

28:36.320 --> 28:39.074
I believe that you are drunk, Albert.

28:41.560 --> 28:45.270
I believe I am. It's the
most peculiar sensation.

28:45.440 --> 28:48.831
- Mm-hm.
- It feels as if I have elves around my person.

28:49.000 --> 28:50.593
Elves or pixies?

28:50.760 --> 28:54.470
- One cannot be sure.
- It is important to be accurate, Albert.

28:54.640 --> 28:56.791
- We must always tell the truth.
- Yes, we must.

28:56.960 --> 28:58.633
No deception.

28:58.800 --> 29:03.352
I will tell you the truth. I am not
going to marry Princess Alda...

29:04.360 --> 29:06.716
.. because she is not a
woman, she is a thistle.

29:06.880 --> 29:09.600
Uncle Leopold would not marry a thistle.

29:09.760 --> 29:11.752
And I will not, either.

29:12.680 --> 29:14.273
I think I need another drink.

29:15.160 --> 29:16.753
So do I.

29:17.320 --> 29:18.993
Danke.

29:22.720 --> 29:24.712
- Ernest.
- Ja?

29:26.680 --> 29:28.194
Uncle Leopold told me...

29:28.360 --> 29:31.000
Nein. This is not a
moment for Uncle Leopold.

29:35.040 --> 29:38.829
It's... never a moment for Uncle Leopold.

30:22.360 --> 30:27.992
Albert? What on earth is the matter?
What are you doing with this armour?

30:28.800 --> 30:30.473
It's for my protection.

30:30.640 --> 30:33.758
Albert, you are upset, I understand that,

30:33.920 --> 30:35.991
but behaving like Ernest
is not going to help.

30:36.160 --> 30:38.356
At least Ernest knows who his father is.

30:39.960 --> 30:42.395
Albert, you must not speak like this.

30:42.560 --> 30:45.632
You know, I-I-I always felt something.

30:49.080 --> 30:51.117
Thank you for making it so clear to me.

30:52.160 --> 30:53.833
I'm so proud of you, Albert,

30:54.000 --> 30:57.311
and now that you are a father,
you must understand my feeling.

30:57.480 --> 30:59.233
Understand?

31:00.000 --> 31:01.753
Do you know what you have made me?

31:05.880 --> 31:07.360
- A sham.
- No.

31:07.520 --> 31:10.319
No? My entire life a lie.

31:10.480 --> 31:12.392
Victoria married to a bastard.

31:12.560 --> 31:14.153
My children illegitimate!

31:17.360 --> 31:18.999
Ruined.

31:20.560 --> 31:24.156
And everything I've done for the...
for the palace, for the monarchy.

31:24.320 --> 31:27.358
It all amounted to sheer hypocrisy
because of your behaviour!

31:29.320 --> 31:31.312
Your behaviour!

31:34.160 --> 31:36.516
The British press, they already
draw me as a sausage.

31:36.680 --> 31:38.637
Imagine what would happen
if they found out...

31:38.800 --> 31:41.315
No one must find out. Not even Victoria.

31:41.480 --> 31:43.790
This stays between us.

31:43.960 --> 31:46.600
And besides, it cannot be proven.

31:48.960 --> 31:50.360
Then why tell me?

31:51.280 --> 31:53.272
I wanted to bring you comfort.

32:05.040 --> 32:06.235
Oh...

32:17.400 --> 32:19.357
Good morning, Your Majesty.

32:21.080 --> 32:22.480
Good morning.

32:26.760 --> 32:28.752
Wilhelmina.

32:31.520 --> 32:34.797
The Sultan of Muscat wanted
to present you with a tiger cub,

32:34.960 --> 32:39.876
but I persuaded him that a puppy
would be more appropriate.

32:40.040 --> 32:41.713
Aw!

32:44.720 --> 32:46.712
So much more appropriate.

32:48.920 --> 32:50.593
Hello.

32:51.640 --> 32:55.759
But, ma'am, the bed is
no place for an animal.

32:55.920 --> 32:59.755
Well, I know how much you care
for tradition, Duchess,

32:59.920 --> 33:02.833
and so I will treat her
just as I treated Dash.

33:03.000 --> 33:05.469
But Dash, ma'am, was housetrained.

33:06.280 --> 33:10.194
And this creature... is not.

33:25.640 --> 33:28.280
Were you going to leave
without saying goodbye?

33:48.800 --> 33:50.757
Come to England soon, ja?

33:50.920 --> 33:52.149
Yah!

34:03.160 --> 34:04.992
Albert has left?

34:05.160 --> 34:08.710
Yes. I thought he was going
to stay longer, didn't you?

34:10.440 --> 34:13.159
I wonder what made him decide to leave.

34:14.520 --> 34:16.512
I wonder.

34:25.280 --> 34:27.556
Oh, Mrs Skerrett,
thank goodness I found you.

34:27.719 --> 34:30.996
- Whatever's the matter?
- There is a terrible to-do in the kitchens.

34:31.159 --> 34:33.800
They're saying that Mr
Francatelli's the one

34:33.960 --> 34:37.237
that sold the story about
the intruder to the newspaper.

34:38.040 --> 34:39.268
Francatelli?

34:40.719 --> 34:42.598
Why would anyone accuse him?

34:42.760 --> 34:46.719
The Baroness was after noticing
the ring and the pocket watch,

34:46.880 --> 34:49.270
so she told Mr Penge
to search his room.

34:51.120 --> 34:53.760
He found ten pounds in sovereigns.

34:53.920 --> 34:56.594
Do you really think he got all that
money from selling the story?

34:58.400 --> 35:00.551
No, Miss Cleary.

35:01.400 --> 35:02.595
I don't.

35:13.560 --> 35:15.552
Ah, Drummond.

35:16.560 --> 35:18.438
I didn't know you were a member.

35:18.600 --> 35:20.398
I'm not.

35:20.560 --> 35:22.597
I was meeting the Marquis of Lothian.

35:24.520 --> 35:26.034
Is he a friend of yours?

35:26.680 --> 35:28.353
He's going to be my father-in-law.

35:29.440 --> 35:30.920
You're engaged.

35:33.200 --> 35:35.840
May I offer my congratulations?

35:36.840 --> 35:38.832
Excuse me.

35:40.880 --> 35:43.679
Well, my cousin, she's
called Eliza Skerrett.

35:43.840 --> 35:45.718
Not me.

35:45.880 --> 35:48.349
It was her who was
at the Chiswick Institute.

35:48.520 --> 35:51.194
It was her who was meant to be
at this palace, but...

35:52.960 --> 35:56.032
.. she fell pregnant, so I took her place,

35:56.200 --> 35:58.556
so I could support her and the baby.

35:59.640 --> 36:00.835
And erm...

36:04.280 --> 36:07.114
Well, Eliza has always felt she was...

36:08.200 --> 36:11.113
.. hard done by, so when I told her
about the Boy Jones...

36:13.720 --> 36:15.712
.. she sold the story to the papers.

36:20.840 --> 36:22.877
I don't know what possessed her to do it.

36:28.480 --> 36:30.119
How old is the child?

36:30.720 --> 36:33.360
- Just four, ma'am.
- This is unbelievable.

36:37.160 --> 36:40.471
I am sorry for your
cousin and for the child.

36:40.640 --> 36:42.438
But, Majesty!

36:47.120 --> 36:49.680
But to deceive me like that
when I thought I could...

36:52.600 --> 36:54.831
We must be surrounded
by people we can trust.

36:58.000 --> 36:59.912
Perhaps I could forgive you.

37:01.600 --> 37:03.592
The Prince, I fear, will not.

38:08.360 --> 38:10.192
You look so tired.

38:10.360 --> 38:12.397
I have been travelling for four days.

38:13.560 --> 38:15.791
Oh, Eos!

38:15.960 --> 38:18.680
Good boy. Good boy.

38:22.320 --> 38:24.073
Who's this?

38:24.240 --> 38:27.153
Ah! Come on. Come on!

38:28.120 --> 38:30.794
Isn't she adorable?

38:30.960 --> 38:32.838
Her name is Isla.

38:33.000 --> 38:34.480
Isla.

38:37.720 --> 38:39.712
I'm so pleased you're back.

38:43.760 --> 38:47.117
All this time, she's been an impostor.

38:47.280 --> 38:49.875
Astonishing really, she
could stand the guilt.

38:51.760 --> 38:53.194
I had to dismiss her.

38:53.360 --> 38:56.990
But you always said that she was
the best dresser you have ever had.

38:57.160 --> 38:58.594
She is.

39:00.600 --> 39:04.116
Was. I thought you of, all people,
would understand.

39:05.160 --> 39:07.629
You always talk about
the importance of truth.

39:12.000 --> 39:13.992
The carriage is ready, Your Majesty.

39:16.040 --> 39:18.032
Albert, you must get ready.

39:19.080 --> 39:22.312
I am sorry, Victoria. I-I cannot attend.

39:23.680 --> 39:25.717
But it's the opening of the tunnel.

39:25.880 --> 39:28.873
The joining of one side of
the Thames to the other.

39:29.040 --> 39:31.032
I know.

39:32.120 --> 39:34.112
It's a big day, Victoria.

39:35.240 --> 39:38.119
Even so, I cannot attend.

39:41.320 --> 39:43.198
What is it?

39:43.360 --> 39:47.274
I just feel as though I am not
ready for people to look at me.

39:47.440 --> 39:51.514
I- I feel as if I have a skin missing.

40:09.880 --> 40:11.872
I thought that you did not need me.

40:14.640 --> 40:16.632
Liebes, I have never needed you so much.

40:43.120 --> 40:45.430
Mr Brunel is waiting for you, ma'am.

41:14.240 --> 41:16.436
Oh. Skerrett?

41:21.240 --> 41:23.232
Your Royal Highness.

41:24.320 --> 41:29.998
I believe it's time you were given a room
which reflects your new position.

41:30.160 --> 41:32.152
But I've been dismissed, sir.

41:33.120 --> 41:37.876
I think the Queen would find it
hard to manage without you. Don't you?

41:40.040 --> 41:42.635
I mean, yes, you pretended
to be someone you were not

41:42.800 --> 41:45.759
but... you have served the Queen
to the best of your ability.

41:45.920 --> 41:47.513
So...

41:49.120 --> 41:51.476
I don't deserve this, Your Royal Highness.

41:52.480 --> 41:55.234
Everyone deserves a second chance,
Mrs Skerrett.

41:58.960 --> 42:00.872
Good day.

42:05.240 --> 42:07.960
Fetch it, Isla! Come on...

42:09.760 --> 42:11.991
Oh, a new dog and a new child?

42:12.160 --> 42:14.470
I wonder how you manage your time, Drina.

42:14.640 --> 42:16.518
Very well.

42:16.680 --> 42:18.990
I'd like to see my grandson.

42:25.880 --> 42:28.714
- He has your eyes, Drina.
- No, he doesn't.

42:37.160 --> 42:39.152
Perhaps there is some similarity.

42:54.280 --> 42:56.078
Aw.

44:04.560 --> 44:07.120
I am too slow for you.

44:15.200 --> 44:17.396
I expect you'll want the
children to learn soon.

44:17.560 --> 44:19.438
The children...

44:19.600 --> 44:23.640
How was er... Bertie while I was away?

44:25.080 --> 44:26.992
Has he learned how to smile yet?

44:28.000 --> 44:29.878
I wouldn't know.

44:30.040 --> 44:32.635
- What do you mean?
- He never smiles for me.

44:34.240 --> 44:36.232
Liebes, I do not understand.

44:39.120 --> 44:40.600
No.

44:40.760 --> 44:44.231
No, you don't understand what
it's like to look at your child and...

44:45.640 --> 44:47.996
.. feel as though
you have nothing to offer it.

44:49.800 --> 44:51.792
That's how worthless I felt.

44:52.720 --> 44:54.518
Why did you not tell me?

44:56.920 --> 44:58.912
I shouldn't feel like that.

45:01.600 --> 45:03.592
Sometimes I feel...

45:04.920 --> 45:11.952
.. as though I'm just pretending to be a
mother and be a queen, but really...

45:13.960 --> 45:15.952
.. I'm an impostor.

45:16.960 --> 45:19.350
I'm just a little girl wearing a crown.

45:22.600 --> 45:24.592
No.

45:26.400 --> 45:28.517
No, I think you are honest.
