01:42.000 --> 01:44.871
? I try in vain

01:45.963 --> 01:49.167
? To disconnect my brain

01:50.511 --> 01:53.262
? I don't know if I can handle it...

01:53.347 --> 01:54.806
? I want you so bad.

01:54.890 --> 01:57.512
? Handle so much pain

02:16.332 --> 02:19.535
? I don't know what's left to gain

02:20.671 --> 02:24.040
? All the guilt and now the blame

02:24.800 --> 02:28.134
? I don't want to stop this game

02:29.138 --> 02:32.343
? I'm starting to enjoy the pain

02:50.497 --> 02:53.949
? I don't care what you claim

02:54.835 --> 02:58.536
? I still hear your voice replaying

02:58.924 --> 03:02.542
? The only thing that remains

03:03.220 --> 03:04.880
? Is to disconnect

03:05.765 --> 03:07.259
? Disconnect

03:07.808 --> 03:09.470
? Disconnect

03:09.562 --> 03:10.972
? My pain

04:04.834 --> 04:06.494
- Hey.
- Hi.

04:06.586 --> 04:09.541
- What is this place?
- I'm not too sure yet.

04:09.632 --> 04:12.503
- So, it's not your room?
- No, it is. It's my room.

04:12.593 --> 04:14.587
I just haven't decided.

04:14.679 --> 04:18.891
Chelsea Teens, exclamation mark.
Is this a joke?

04:18.975 --> 04:20.351
Well, how do you mean?

04:20.435 --> 04:21.764
- Is it yours?
- Yeah.

04:21.853 --> 04:25.638
- So what does it mean?
- I don't know yet.

04:25.775 --> 04:28.018
A room for Chelsea teens prone
to exclamation?

04:28.111 --> 04:30.317
Well, maybe.

04:30.405 --> 04:32.279
And that's you?

04:32.367 --> 04:34.324
Yeah, probably.

04:34.411 --> 04:36.070
Is it you?

04:36.162 --> 04:38.369
It probably is.

04:38.457 --> 04:40.284
Me too!

04:40.375 --> 04:42.203
I'm Emily.

04:42.295 --> 04:45.212
- William.
- I'm Jim.

04:45.298 --> 04:49.047
So what's the purpose of Chelsea Teens?

04:49.136 --> 04:52.422
It's a very big question. William?

04:53.766 --> 04:58.229
Er...I think it would be nice to talk
and make newfriends.

04:58.313 --> 05:00.520
We can define what the room is later.

05:00.607 --> 05:02.850
So how do we begin to talk?

05:02.986 --> 05:05.940
Choose someone you hate, share it,
and we talk shit from there.

05:06.031 --> 05:08.237
- Well, I'm Mo.
- Who do you hate, Mo?

05:08.325 --> 05:11.160
People who hate television.

05:11.245 --> 05:13.535
People who think those who watch it
are idiots.

05:13.623 --> 05:15.200
I hate those people.

05:15.291 --> 05:17.332
- Because television is so important.
- Yeah.

05:17.419 --> 05:19.412
- Do you watch a lot of television?
- Tons.

05:19.505 --> 05:22.423
- It's important to have a hobby.
- It's not a hobby.

05:22.508 --> 05:26.923
- Important to keep busy?
- It's important we study life, William.

05:27.013 --> 05:28.425
Right.

05:28.515 --> 05:31.267
- Who do you hate, William?
- Oh, God...

05:31.352 --> 05:33.642
I don't really hate anything.

05:33.730 --> 05:35.806
There must be
something that irritates you.

05:38.068 --> 05:39.397
Er...

05:43.866 --> 05:45.326
Grace Rollins.

05:45.410 --> 05:48.780
- I love her Ripley books!
- Irritates the shit out of me!

05:48.873 --> 05:50.996
- She's a wonderful writer.
- She's a fake.

05:51.083 --> 05:54.002
She's got children into history.
That's a positive thing.

05:54.086 --> 05:56.329
Ripley Goes To Pompeii. When I read it,

05:56.424 --> 05:59.958
I didn't feel any need to read any other
books about Pompeii or volcanoes.

06:00.052 --> 06:01.428
That's how good it was!

06:01.513 --> 06:04.679
Wow. That's one of the saddest things
I've ever heard, Mo.

06:04.766 --> 06:06.426
Really?

06:07.727 --> 06:12.022
Have you got a few minutes?
I'd really like to show you something.

06:13.359 --> 06:16.361
Boys and girls, it's the Black Plague...

06:16.447 --> 06:19.898
Grace Rollins stylee.

06:31.588 --> 06:35.504
So, here we have Ripley,
our spoilt, smug hero.

06:36.471 --> 06:37.751
Glorious, isn't it?

06:37.888 --> 06:41.258
Ah-ha. It's lute-playing Archibold!

06:45.314 --> 06:47.888
Those wretched rats.

06:49.027 --> 06:51.732
Agh! Argh!

07:18.728 --> 07:21.302
Somehow, he magically saves the day.

07:21.398 --> 07:24.400
Typical Grace Rollins.
Don't you just hate her?

07:24.485 --> 07:26.892
Great work.
I'm in a media club at Chelsea Tech

07:26.987 --> 07:29.277
and I've never seen work like that.
It's amazing.

07:29.366 --> 07:31.317
Besides taking the
piss out of Grace Rollins,

07:31.318 --> 07:32.901
do you have a wider point?

07:32.995 --> 07:36.411
How the lies we're told begin early
in childhood.

07:36.498 --> 07:39.073
- The suppression of teenagers.
- It's a good point.

07:39.168 --> 07:41.125
It's got to come back to our parents,
right?

07:41.212 --> 07:43.834
Do you think our parents
are scared of us?

07:43.966 --> 07:46.005
Yeah. And they have every right to be.

07:46.093 --> 07:49.462
We're better educated than they were.
We're more connected to the world.

07:49.555 --> 07:51.762
They don't see it that way.
They see the opposite.

07:51.850 --> 07:53.558
They think of us as an experiment.

07:53.643 --> 07:56.349
It's not clear what my parents
are trying to produce in me,

07:56.439 --> 07:58.728
but, regardless of that,
they're messing me up.

07:58.816 --> 08:00.644
- But not on purpose.
- Oh, no.

08:00.777 --> 08:03.232
It's often a conscious decision
to mess you up, Jim.

08:04.324 --> 08:07.028
I'm cleverer,
more adaptable than my parents.

08:07.118 --> 08:10.866
But you're still a child to them!

08:10.997 --> 08:12.872
- Oh, definitely.
- Well...

08:13.000 --> 08:14.792
take the power, Emily.

08:14.877 --> 08:17.546
- The power?
- Yeah, you know how the world works,

08:17.631 --> 08:20.251
what makes people tick.

08:20.341 --> 08:23.129
- Yeah.
- Let's have a bit more ambition.

08:23.220 --> 08:25.972
Seize the moment.
Make something of the world.

08:26.057 --> 08:27.634
Do, make or kill something?

08:27.725 --> 08:29.967
Yeah. I mean, how about all three?

08:30.062 --> 08:33.977
I mean, to make life count,
you've got to use life, right?

08:34.067 --> 08:37.684
So how about using these next
two months to arrive into the world?

08:37.821 --> 08:39.279
Wow.

08:39.364 --> 08:41.238
Creative and positive.

08:41.325 --> 08:44.907
You really are a teen exclamation mark.

08:47.665 --> 08:50.666
Oh...I'm sorry.
That turned into a lot of shit.

08:50.752 --> 08:52.912
- I think we should meet again.
- Definitely.

08:53.047 --> 08:55.800
I'd... I'd really like to chat
on a regular basis.

08:55.883 --> 08:58.256
- Me too.
- And me. Eva?

08:59.345 --> 09:00.889
Yeah. Yeah, why not.

09:00.972 --> 09:02.052
Great.

09:02.140 --> 09:03.932
What about you, William?

09:04.059 --> 09:06.432
Yeah, let's be friends.

09:06.521 --> 09:08.727
Yes!

10:01.836 --> 10:04.161
She's sitting inside. Are you ready?

10:15.851 --> 10:17.644
OK, then?

10:33.873 --> 10:35.368
Hey.

10:36.626 --> 10:39.035
Models 1 have taken on Ushi.

10:40.047 --> 10:42.835
- Seriously?
- Yeah. They called her this morning.

10:45.053 --> 10:46.761
Christ.

10:46.847 --> 10:48.472
Who are you with again?

10:48.557 --> 10:50.431
Models A La Mode.

10:50.518 --> 10:53.140
You should get your portfolio down
to Models 1.

10:53.229 --> 10:55.472
You're stunning.

10:55.566 --> 10:57.226
It's true. She is.

10:57.318 --> 11:00.272
- She scowls.
- She doesn't always scowl.

11:00.362 --> 11:03.150
I've known her since nursery.
It's her default expression.

11:03.241 --> 11:05.317
- Look at her face.
- Piss off.

11:05.410 --> 11:07.866
Modelling's more of a hobby for you.

11:07.996 --> 11:10.998
- You're too small.
- She's so cute.

11:11.083 --> 11:12.992
Little Polly Pocket!

11:33.235 --> 11:35.524
Ahh! Mo!

11:43.288 --> 11:45.115
I'm dying!

11:45.958 --> 11:47.702
Help me!

11:53.842 --> 11:55.420
I think that's our last session.

11:56.720 --> 11:59.342
Do we need to meet and talk again,
do you think?

12:00.725 --> 12:03.430
You're feeling good about things, right?

12:04.479 --> 12:06.555
Yeah, I feel great.

12:06.649 --> 12:08.688
And Paul?

12:08.776 --> 12:11.314
We've all benefitted, for sure.

12:11.405 --> 12:13.362
Thanks for everything.

12:13.490 --> 12:15.898
I feel like you're part of the family.

12:15.993 --> 12:19.612
Well, if you want to make up
the spare room...

12:19.706 --> 12:22.162
So, I wish you all the best.

12:22.292 --> 12:24.166
Keep talking.

12:25.629 --> 12:27.289
All right, William?

12:31.010 --> 12:32.837
Thank you.

13:42.261 --> 13:45.282
There comes a time when you see
your friends for the posh,

13:45.325 --> 13:47.090
vapid bitches they are.

13:47.225 --> 13:49.182
Well, it's shocking.

13:49.269 --> 13:51.475
Well, I really appreciate your time

13:51.562 --> 13:53.971
- in what seems to be a very...
- Let's make it short.

13:55.275 --> 13:56.438
Sure.

13:59.030 --> 14:01.070
Good afternoon, ladies.

14:01.158 --> 14:06.070
Welcome to this two-day course
in deportment and public speaking.

14:17.051 --> 14:18.463
This is your room?

14:19.554 --> 14:21.346
This is it.

14:24.685 --> 14:26.311
This is your personality?

14:26.395 --> 14:29.979
This is an aspect of my personality.

14:32.361 --> 14:34.900
Follow me.

14:39.077 --> 14:40.572
? Let it go...

14:40.704 --> 14:42.662
This is a room.

14:44.041 --> 14:45.785
Oh, wow.

14:48.504 --> 14:51.672
- Hello!
- Hey, William!

14:51.760 --> 14:53.799
- Great.
- Are you all right, Emily?

14:54.888 --> 14:57.924
Isn't this the most beautiful place
you've ever seen?

14:58.016 --> 14:59.391
I love it.

15:00.436 --> 15:01.680
It's great.

15:04.649 --> 15:05.929
Eva...

15:06.985 --> 15:09.393
I can't remember inviting you here.

15:10.406 --> 15:12.398
I mean, come on, look!

15:12.533 --> 15:14.490
I couldn't stay away!

15:14.577 --> 15:18.361
I'm sorry. You don't mind, do you?

15:19.417 --> 15:20.958
Do you want me to go?

15:21.043 --> 15:23.332
Oh, let him stay, Eva. Come on.

15:26.966 --> 15:29.090
Sure. Whatever.

15:29.971 --> 15:32.010
? Let it go

15:33.933 --> 15:38.014
? We've been stealing voices from throats

15:40.065 --> 15:42.556
? Somersault, let it go

15:42.651 --> 15:44.858
? Let it go

15:58.879 --> 16:00.788
No-one's sitting here, are they?

16:04.302 --> 16:06.010
What is that?

16:07.305 --> 16:09.049
It's a golden gourami.

16:10.517 --> 16:12.427
Yeah, I just bought it...now.

16:13.479 --> 16:15.637
You bought it dead?

16:22.114 --> 16:24.024
Shit.

16:28.872 --> 16:30.284
So, are you gonna talk, then?

16:36.214 --> 16:37.839
Er...

16:39.342 --> 16:40.837
She's an only child.

16:40.928 --> 16:44.878
It would have been nice to have
another one, but it just didn't happen.

16:44.975 --> 16:46.600
It's all so desperate,

16:46.685 --> 16:50.055
but they're turning us into
these unbelievably dull people.

16:50.148 --> 16:52.638
It's dull and tasteless.
It's a good combination.

16:52.733 --> 16:54.193
I know we could be happy

16:54.277 --> 16:56.602
if they respected themselves
for what they are.

16:56.696 --> 16:59.105
So I want to wake us all up.

16:59.868 --> 17:02.193
And I want their love.

17:02.286 --> 17:04.613
I really do.

17:04.705 --> 17:09.617
Well, the closest our family's ever been
was when my dad had prostate cancer.

17:09.712 --> 17:14.126
I mean, that malignant growth in his
arse was the happiest time of our lives.

17:15.510 --> 17:17.967
Do you think you could fake
a semi-terminal illness?

17:19.056 --> 17:20.634
I've never tried...

17:20.724 --> 17:22.848
Or violence, then?

17:22.935 --> 17:24.680
Seriously?

17:24.771 --> 17:28.105
Yeah, a family under attack
will always pull together.

17:28.191 --> 17:30.066
Is that true?

17:30.153 --> 17:32.822
A little fear and they'll stop
with the social climbing,

17:32.905 --> 17:35.148
get back to the basics
of loving their daughter.

17:35.242 --> 17:38.908
- You think so?
- It's a wake-up call for them, Emily.

17:38.997 --> 17:40.954
You'd just be doing them a favour.

17:41.040 --> 17:42.665
Right.

17:43.544 --> 17:46.664
So, for the purpose
of bringing you closer together,

17:46.756 --> 17:50.457
do you think you could do some
random violence on your parents?

17:51.303 --> 17:54.339
- I could try some random violence!
- Oh, fantastic.

17:54.431 --> 17:57.635
Of course,
I wouldn't know where to start.

17:57.727 --> 18:00.894
Oh, well, myself and William
can brainstorm ideas with you.

18:00.981 --> 18:05.192
Just small, petty things to begin with.
Right, William?

18:05.945 --> 18:08.186
Premeditated murder I disapprove of.

18:09.073 --> 18:11.695
- But random violence I can do.
- Good boy.

18:11.784 --> 18:15.237
- Oh...this is great.
- Let's get started!

18:46.408 --> 18:48.449
But who's Jim?

19:00.050 --> 19:01.235
Yeah, it's nice.

19:01.525 --> 19:03.716
It needs a bit of colour, though,
right?

19:04.764 --> 19:06.803
Er...

19:10.395 --> 19:12.305
You don't talk much.

19:12.398 --> 19:15.067
Is it that you're shy,
or don't you like people?

19:19.323 --> 19:21.480
Shy.

19:23.326 --> 19:25.403
Do you allow yourself to have friends?

19:29.250 --> 19:30.626
No.

19:37.760 --> 19:41.379
Do you think you'll be here
when I come back outside, Jim?

19:43.141 --> 19:44.969
I really hope so.

20:15.971 --> 20:17.929
Ta-da!

20:20.060 --> 20:22.551
Shit!

20:50.679 --> 20:52.637
Hi, Mum.

20:53.849 --> 20:55.510
Yeah, I'm OK. I'm fine.

21:47.078 --> 21:49.036
Is there anyone there?

21:52.210 --> 21:54.167
Where is everyone?

21:57.591 --> 22:00.509
And you can do that,
you'll have the time?

22:00.594 --> 22:02.630
I'm doing six months of publicity -

22:02.631 --> 22:04.178
they can give me a week or two.

22:04.266 --> 22:08.346
- It'd be fun to get away together.
- Yeah. It would.

22:08.437 --> 22:11.807
Do you remember our holidays
in Padstow, William, that house?

22:14.528 --> 22:16.187
Erm...no.

22:19.325 --> 22:20.903
Too young, maybe.

22:27.960 --> 22:30.286
Hello, there. Where are you?

22:30.379 --> 22:31.791
It's Ripley.

22:31.882 --> 22:33.708
Where'd you say, Moscow?

22:33.800 --> 22:36.718
- Let me put you on speakerphone.
- Can you hear me?

22:36.803 --> 22:38.596
- Hey, Ripley.
- Hey, Dad.

22:38.680 --> 22:41.172
- So nice you called.
- What are you doing in Moscow?

22:41.268 --> 22:45.135
Meeting potential investors.
A little exhausting.

22:45.230 --> 22:49.727
But listen, I really want to be there
for the book launch.

22:49.819 --> 22:52.773
What? You're too busy.

22:52.864 --> 22:56.233
I want to be there for you.
I miss you all.

22:56.326 --> 22:58.319
Where's William?

22:58.412 --> 23:00.405
William's here.

23:00.498 --> 23:03.167
We had our last session today.
We're finished now.

23:03.252 --> 23:06.170
- Oh, great!
- We're starting over.

23:06.255 --> 23:09.209
It's great, William.
I wish I was there to celebrate.

23:11.719 --> 23:14.637
William? Come back!

25:47.192 --> 25:49.186
Let's do it, Keisha, love.

25:49.279 --> 25:50.738
OK, Si.

25:58.039 --> 26:01.041
Keep it moving, keep it flowing.

26:01.836 --> 26:04.077
? My name is Tallulah

26:04.212 --> 26:06.170
? My first rule of thumb...

26:06.257 --> 26:09.093
Nice and strong! Good girl.

26:09.219 --> 26:11.840
?..or where I'm coming from...

26:11.930 --> 26:14.801
Nice tight knees. Go on, tight knees.

26:16.311 --> 26:21.222
? So if you really need to,
you know how to find me...

26:23.903 --> 26:27.097
What you said about your parents
treating you as an experiment,

26:27.099 --> 26:29.361
that was insightful.

26:29.451 --> 26:32.121
That was great, Mo.

26:32.247 --> 26:34.737
Yeah, yeah, but you know,
maybe they should.

26:34.832 --> 26:37.667
- I don't actually do anything.
- You're clever, aren't you?

26:37.752 --> 26:40.161
I can see that you're bright.

26:40.255 --> 26:43.008
- I can be, yeah. I can be.
- Yeah, of course you can.

26:43.092 --> 26:46.509
And you can do whatever you want,
anything at all.

26:47.430 --> 26:49.839
You're so positive, man. It's like...

26:49.933 --> 26:52.341
Is this for teenage girls?

26:58.902 --> 27:02.735
- Well, are you a teenage girl?
- Yeah, I'm Tina.

27:04.117 --> 27:05.825
Tina the teenage girl?

27:05.911 --> 27:08.581
Yeah, are you a teenage girl?

27:08.664 --> 27:13.576
Yeah, and at the moment
I'm touching myself.

27:13.670 --> 27:16.126
Really?

27:16.215 --> 27:19.749
- Are you good at it?
- I'm usually a lot better...

27:19.884 --> 27:22.554
when I'm not hacking into
Tony Layton's home computer

27:22.638 --> 27:25.260
and putting his name
on the sex offenders register.

27:26.977 --> 27:28.520
Paedo!

27:28.604 --> 27:30.892
You hacked him that fast?

27:30.981 --> 27:34.066
We've got to secure this room
so there's only five of us.

27:37.239 --> 27:40.739
Do you think at 17
you can be called a paedophile?

27:40.826 --> 27:43.697
Depends on the age of the girl,
doesn't it?

27:43.789 --> 27:45.365
- 11.
- Months or years?

27:45.456 --> 27:47.414
Years.

27:49.546 --> 27:51.503
Are we talking about you?

27:54.342 --> 27:56.880
Maybe.

27:58.806 --> 28:02.306
- Have you tried anything?
- No! I'm ashamed of myself.

28:02.394 --> 28:04.101
Well...OK.

28:04.187 --> 28:06.761
Why not practise on an older woman?

28:07.858 --> 28:09.935
Experience a woman with experience,

28:10.028 --> 28:12.863
and it might take your mind off
the younger ones.

28:12.947 --> 28:16.780
- I'll find you some addresses.
- Cheers, Will.

28:16.869 --> 28:21.947
What screws do you use?
I mean, they're good screws.

28:22.041 --> 28:25.458
And a good screwdriver.
I mean, I love the detail,

28:25.545 --> 28:27.503
the yellow and the black.

28:28.632 --> 28:31.124
They go right in there.

28:31.219 --> 28:32.926
Great, are we nearly decorated?

28:33.012 --> 28:35.930
I think all of you teens
will be overjoyed.

28:36.015 --> 28:37.475
Excellent. Will we exclaim?

28:37.560 --> 28:39.932
- You will exclaim.
- Oh, thank God for that!

28:40.020 --> 28:42.975
- What about the security?
- Paedos locked out.

28:43.066 --> 28:45.819
Well, most of them.

28:46.653 --> 28:48.694
I hope you boys like the new look.

28:48.781 --> 28:51.272
- Have you got the password?
- Of course I have.

28:52.326 --> 28:55.661
Dead Ripley.

29:02.297 --> 29:04.622
- Whoo!
? I left my heart in Tokyo

29:04.716 --> 29:06.792
? Down by the river, don't you know?

29:06.886 --> 29:08.713
? I had to let it go...

29:08.805 --> 29:12.008
- Isn't it fun!
? I left my heart in Tokyo

29:12.100 --> 29:14.472
? Down by the river, don't you know?

29:14.561 --> 29:15.806
? I had to let it go...

29:15.896 --> 29:17.770
William, you have to be with us.

29:19.900 --> 29:21.015
Mm.

29:21.111 --> 29:23.982
I can't do this again. Come downstairs.

29:25.698 --> 29:29.567
- I have friends.
- Online friends?

29:33.542 --> 29:34.573
Yeah.

29:37.046 --> 29:39.751
You're not going to get better
talking to strangers.

29:42.761 --> 29:46.296
You want to make sure that boy
you were doesn't come back, right?

29:51.772 --> 29:53.729
No, I don't wanna be like that again.

29:56.277 --> 29:58.946
Then come down and talk.

29:59.071 --> 30:02.323
- We just want to see you better...
- I just, just...

30:54.721 --> 30:58.714
So, Jim...you're up!

30:58.808 --> 31:00.089
What?

31:01.303 --> 31:05.980
Anything to share? Who do you hate?

31:06.066 --> 31:08.356
Well, I'm not too sure.

31:10.447 --> 31:13.947
- It's difficult.
- Come on! Come on, get personal.

31:14.994 --> 31:17.153
Who is it?

31:17.246 --> 31:19.453
Who does Jim hate?

31:19.583 --> 31:21.160
Me.

31:25.715 --> 31:27.126
Really, Jim?

31:27.217 --> 31:31.001
You hate yourself?

31:31.096 --> 31:33.054
So what?

31:34.183 --> 31:37.018
Do you have an OK family life?

31:37.103 --> 31:40.388
Yeah. Yeah.

31:40.482 --> 31:44.860
I don't have a father.
But my mum's really nice.

31:44.946 --> 31:48.446
Oh, so you hate yourself because...?

31:52.662 --> 31:55.237
I've been on anti-depressants
for two years.

31:56.835 --> 31:59.919
And do they help?

32:00.005 --> 32:02.045
Do you know whether they're helping?

32:03.426 --> 32:05.752
I don't know.

32:05.845 --> 32:08.171
- Maybe.
- Come off the medication.

32:11.143 --> 32:13.598
If you want to feel like a person again...

32:15.482 --> 32:17.107
..come off them.

32:18.318 --> 32:20.275
You do know that, don't you, Jim?

32:24.450 --> 32:25.696
Yeah.

32:26.119 --> 32:27.400
Yeah.

32:29.290 --> 32:31.247
We're your friends.

32:33.461 --> 32:39.132
If you're brave enough to come off
the pills... we'll be there for you.

32:41.469 --> 32:42.716
- Won't we?
- Definitely.

32:42.805 --> 32:44.963
Yeah, absolutely.

32:45.057 --> 32:49.138
- You'd do that?
- Yeah, we don't want you to be alone.

32:53.484 --> 32:58.479
Some people like to stay faceless in here.

33:01.077 --> 33:03.034
Do you think...

33:05.373 --> 33:07.331
..we could see what you look like?

33:10.754 --> 33:12.712
Jim?

33:19.140 --> 33:21.097
It would help.

33:28.609 --> 33:30.102
Yeah.

33:31.196 --> 33:32.855
Yeah, all right.

34:14.411 --> 34:17.746
You don't strike me
as a charitable sort of person.

34:22.422 --> 34:24.378
What are you going to do?

34:27.094 --> 34:29.051
Banish some demons.

34:31.391 --> 34:33.348
Give him some answers.

34:37.148 --> 34:39.105
We're playing around with Emily.

34:40.400 --> 34:43.355
Do you want to mess with Jim a little?

34:47.909 --> 34:49.237
Maybe.

34:52.998 --> 34:54.956
Just maybe?

34:57.462 --> 34:59.206
It's your birthday tomorrow, right?

35:00.842 --> 35:02.170
Yeah.

35:03.219 --> 35:05.461
Only right that I get you a present, then.

35:09.852 --> 35:12.309
Who do you hate?

38:06.434 --> 38:10.813
It's good you're coming.
I appreciate it.

38:10.898 --> 38:13.223
Well, I want to help, so...

38:53.907 --> 38:57.441
- Tell me where you're from.
- Tell me what you'd do to me.

38:57.536 --> 38:59.695
Do you like handcuffs?

39:06.755 --> 39:09.543
She's really lovely,
and she's into gymnastics.

39:09.633 --> 39:12.171
She's really clever. Erm...

39:12.261 --> 39:14.504
But I'm attracted to her,
and that's a bit weird.

39:14.597 --> 39:17.349
Would you like me to be Keisha?

39:17.434 --> 39:19.143
Nah, you're all right, thanks.

39:19.227 --> 39:22.098
What are you doing here
if you like Keisha so much?

39:22.189 --> 39:23.601
Well, a friend gave me the idea.

39:23.692 --> 39:26.812
To go online, you know,
see what the older lady likes.

39:26.945 --> 39:29.271
Get your mind off the kids?

39:29.365 --> 39:30.859
Yeah, that's the idea. Yeah.

39:30.951 --> 39:32.492
Unless you're a pervert.

39:32.577 --> 39:34.949
In which case,
you take it any way you can.

39:35.038 --> 39:38.407
I'm into rape scenarios.

39:40.795 --> 39:42.953
- You're what?
- Get up to Leeds.

39:43.047 --> 39:45.290
There's a piece ofwasteland behind me.

39:45.383 --> 39:47.957
- You could have me there.
- Jesus Christ!

39:48.052 --> 39:49.962
You sound dead sweet.

39:50.056 --> 39:54.101
Always wanted a sweet boy
to shag me in the mouth!

39:54.185 --> 39:55.348
Where are you going?

39:55.436 --> 39:58.688
It was a bit weird,

39:58.774 --> 40:01.266
and I was, like...
I felt like I was being raped.

40:01.402 --> 40:04.273
I swear to God, honestly.
It just felt a bit wrong.

40:04.406 --> 40:06.979
People abuse these dating rooms.
Don't worry about it.

40:07.075 --> 40:10.410
But it was creepy, mate.
It was just like... You know?

40:10.496 --> 40:12.655
Well, tell Si how you feel about Keisha.

40:14.417 --> 40:16.457
What?

40:16.545 --> 40:19.250
Friendship's all about
forgiveness and understanding.

40:19.340 --> 40:22.840
It's... It's not like
you've done anything wrong, Mo.

40:22.928 --> 40:27.222
- That's right.
- Yeah, the heart can't be controlled.

40:27.308 --> 40:30.428
Tell him, he'll understand.

40:30.519 --> 40:32.844
- OK, I'll try it.
- I have a present to deliver.

40:32.938 --> 40:35.726
Can you just take overfor a bit?
Do you mind?

40:37.444 --> 40:42.190
- See you later.
- Later. Laters.

40:43.744 --> 40:45.702
Dead Ripley.

40:52.754 --> 40:54.877
Whoa.

40:54.966 --> 40:57.337
You just can't stay away.

40:57.467 --> 40:59.425
It's impossible.

41:00.973 --> 41:02.929
Please.

41:06.978 --> 41:08.557
I'm controlling her discussions,

41:08.648 --> 41:11.353
her correspondence,
any information she puts out there.

41:12.486 --> 41:15.736
I've image-morphed her face
onto the bodies of these girls.

41:15.822 --> 41:19.441
It's like she's been in porn
for two years.

41:22.957 --> 41:25.079
I've broken into Models 1

41:25.167 --> 41:27.456
and I'm working more subtly
on her portfolio.

41:29.005 --> 41:32.256
I'm altering the length of her nose,
narrowing her lips,

41:32.343 --> 41:34.300
shortening the distance between her eyes.

41:34.386 --> 41:36.759
It's imperceptible but enough.

41:36.847 --> 41:38.425
Oh, my God.

41:38.516 --> 41:44.769
I know I said I hated her,
but you've...really killed her.

41:44.857 --> 41:47.977
I know. Isn't it great?

41:52.532 --> 41:54.490
Thank you, William.

41:56.037 --> 41:58.113
Happy birthday, Eva.

42:01.209 --> 42:04.045
- What do you wanna do?
- Whatever.

42:04.129 --> 42:07.546
- Maybe watch a DVD?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

42:07.634 --> 42:09.922
A Kate Winslet one.
Oh, I love that bitch.

42:11.054 --> 42:14.590
Erm...I need to talk to you
about something.

42:14.684 --> 42:16.759
Sounds draining. Make it short.

42:16.852 --> 42:20.222
You know when you was asking
whetherthere was...a girl?

42:20.357 --> 42:21.851
You're gay!

42:22.943 --> 42:25.399
No. No, erm...

42:25.487 --> 42:27.361
- There is a girl.
- Who is she?

42:27.448 --> 42:29.655
Come on, man, tell me. Who is she?

42:31.412 --> 42:32.870
Keisha.

42:36.417 --> 42:37.959
Keisha your sister.

42:39.254 --> 42:42.374
- You're joking.
- I'm not.

42:46.261 --> 42:48.219
She's 11.

42:49.517 --> 42:50.547
I know.

42:50.642 --> 42:52.351
- Have you touched her?
- No!

42:52.437 --> 42:55.009
- But you were going to touch her?
- I needed to talk to you.

42:55.105 --> 42:56.517
I'm not her pimp, Mo!

42:56.608 --> 42:59.893
There's nothing to talk about.
She's an 11-year-old girl.

42:59.987 --> 43:01.861
You paedo!

43:03.699 --> 43:06.155
Can we talk about this
without getting angry, OK?

43:06.244 --> 43:08.866
I haven't done anything.

43:08.955 --> 43:11.791
The heart can't be controlled, Si.

43:11.876 --> 43:13.833
- The heart can't be controlled?
- Yeah.

43:13.919 --> 43:15.580
What kind of gay shit...?

44:45.568 --> 44:47.525
Speak, Jim.

44:49.740 --> 44:51.364
We're all here for you.

44:59.543 --> 45:01.501
I'm seven years old.

45:02.672 --> 45:05.210
And erm...my mum's
gone away for the weekend.

45:05.341 --> 45:08.378
A break or something.

45:10.264 --> 45:12.553
My dad's staying behind to look after me.

45:14.227 --> 45:15.638
And...

45:15.770 --> 45:19.104
we're sat at the kitchen table,
just looking at each other.

45:21.986 --> 45:24.857
So, he asked me what do I want to do.

45:24.948 --> 45:29.527
And straightaway I say
I want to put on my cowboy costume

45:29.620 --> 45:31.577
and go and see the penguins in the zoo.

45:35.877 --> 45:38.333
Can't wait. It's going to be so good.

45:40.508 --> 45:42.335
Don't you think?

45:43.011 --> 45:46.178
Definitely the number one fan of penguins.

45:48.309 --> 45:50.266
So...

45:51.645 --> 45:54.731
..we're going...
We're inside the zoo now,

45:54.817 --> 45:57.688
and I go straight to the penguins.

45:59.489 --> 46:04.994
And I'm standing in my cowboy costume
looking at the penguins,

46:05.078 --> 46:09.373
and having such a great conversation
with my dad, you know?

46:09.458 --> 46:12.294
It was...like, a perfect childhood day.

46:26.979 --> 46:30.313
He lets go of my hand
and says he'll be back.

46:31.651 --> 46:33.608
And he goes.

46:34.989 --> 46:36.946
Gone.

46:39.536 --> 46:41.612
And I'm happy looking at the penguins.

46:43.332 --> 46:45.621
But...

46:45.710 --> 46:49.458
it's been, like, an hour since he left,

46:49.547 --> 46:55.052
so I start to walk around the zoo,
looking for him.

46:55.137 --> 46:58.589
And I'm not worried yet,
I don't talk to anyone or...

46:58.683 --> 47:00.890
I just go to the bus stop
we got off at earlier

47:00.977 --> 47:04.928
and I get on a bus
and I tell the bus driver my address.

47:05.023 --> 47:06.980
And he asks me where my parents are.

47:09.571 --> 47:13.735
And I say they're at home...
waiting for me.

47:17.747 --> 47:19.704
I get the key from under the mat.

47:23.044 --> 47:25.002
And I go inside.

47:26.799 --> 47:28.757
And I'm alone there.

47:31.512 --> 47:34.597
It being a Saturday night, I have a bath.

47:36.394 --> 47:38.350
And I get into my pyjamas.

47:41.066 --> 47:43.023
Because my dad would've liked that.

47:49.159 --> 47:51.117
Er...

47:51.828 --> 47:53.786
It's getting dark outside.

47:56.625 --> 47:58.582
And I start to worry.

48:01.089 --> 48:05.384
And I get the quilt and I go into
the bathroom and I lock the door.

48:11.226 --> 48:13.385
And it feels safer with the door locked.

48:27.077 --> 48:29.035
He's not coming back.

48:37.799 --> 48:39.757
He's never coming back.

49:41.456 --> 49:44.458
What your father did to you...

49:44.543 --> 49:49.918
leaving you like some dog,
is incredible, Jim.

49:51.927 --> 49:56.306
I don't know what it is,
but erm...I'm feeling better.

49:57.726 --> 50:00.300
Erm...maybe just sharing
that story with everyone...

50:00.396 --> 50:01.855
You're not getting better.

50:06.194 --> 50:08.733
- Don't say that.
- What do you want me to say?

50:10.491 --> 50:13.907
What, that you'll be happy
in two weeks' time?

50:16.164 --> 50:18.656
No, I just...

50:18.750 --> 50:21.871
I need some help, William.
I need to stay positive...

50:21.963 --> 50:25.296
Stay in the moment,
cos you're feeling down and panicked.

50:25.383 --> 50:29.677
- Know what you're dealing with, first.
- Are we going?

50:31.265 --> 50:33.092
Look...

50:33.183 --> 50:37.230
you need to talk to people who are
going through the same thing as you.

50:38.316 --> 50:40.771
I know this room.

50:40.860 --> 50:43.149
Called Dorfli Place,
I can get you in there.

50:43.237 --> 50:45.065
It will help.

50:45.157 --> 50:48.740
Jim. Jim, it helped me.

50:57.296 --> 50:58.624
Yeah.

51:01.259 --> 51:03.252
Yeah, OK.

51:06.181 --> 51:08.554
We're still friends, right?

51:08.643 --> 51:10.552
- Yeah.
- Yeah, I mean...

51:10.645 --> 51:13.599
Look, we're gonna have our disagreements.

51:13.690 --> 51:15.647
I'm not leaving you, Jim.

51:20.197 --> 51:22.191
I'll never do what your father did.

52:08.463 --> 52:10.419
What are you doing?

52:10.506 --> 52:12.250
Aren't you over this?

52:14.886 --> 52:16.927
Give it to me.

52:17.056 --> 52:18.598
This is sick.

52:20.768 --> 52:22.642
Get out.

52:23.688 --> 52:26.180
Get out!

52:26.274 --> 52:29.894
That's mine.
Just give it to me cos it's mine!

52:33.158 --> 52:35.400
Just get out! Will you get out!

52:55.726 --> 52:57.137
William?

52:57.227 --> 53:00.479
Please, sweetheart.

53:00.565 --> 53:02.688
Don't do anything.

53:51.291 --> 53:53.249
Open the door!

54:16.988 --> 54:19.658
I need to know
you're not going to hurt yourself.

54:23.495 --> 54:25.868
It's only a video on the internet.

54:25.998 --> 54:27.956
I'm over all that now.

54:31.671 --> 54:33.464
I love you.

54:34.550 --> 54:37.836
You can always come and talk to me,
William. You know that, right?

54:37.929 --> 54:39.887
Phone.

55:36.164 --> 55:38.121
I need to take you to this room.

55:38.208 --> 55:40.082
The whining that goes on in there!

55:40.169 --> 55:44.547
These kids,
you want to annihilate the lot of them.

55:45.842 --> 55:47.800
Can we talk about something else?

55:49.596 --> 55:51.554
Yeah, of course we can.

55:58.606 --> 56:00.564
Have you been flirting with me?

56:02.653 --> 56:07.281
I had to rescue you from
those appalling toffs you call friends.

56:14.042 --> 56:16.000
So...

56:16.879 --> 56:19.500
..are we boyfriend and girlfriend?

56:24.930 --> 56:27.088
Well, after I've crucified Jim...

56:31.604 --> 56:34.558
..I think it might be safe
to take it to the next stage.

56:35.858 --> 56:38.232
An actual physical encounter?

56:40.155 --> 56:42.149
Best not to rush these things.

56:43.577 --> 56:45.534
Difficult to know who you can trust.

56:47.080 --> 56:49.038
Cheeky bugger!

56:53.129 --> 56:55.087
Do you want me to call a doctor?

56:58.385 --> 56:59.583
No.

57:01.180 --> 57:02.759
I'll be fine.

57:06.311 --> 57:08.268
You ring me later. OK?

57:13.404 --> 57:15.361
I love you.

57:24.708 --> 57:26.997
He wasn't well enough to have a child.

57:28.045 --> 57:31.211
They'd have been better off
if it was just the two of them.

57:32.843 --> 57:35.299
So he hated you for being alive?

57:38.892 --> 57:40.137
Maybe.

57:42.520 --> 57:45.475
To blame a child for his shit life...

57:49.738 --> 57:51.694
I hope he shot himself.

58:09.259 --> 58:11.217
Have you ever held a gun, Jim?

58:12.765 --> 58:13.713
No.

58:26.572 --> 58:28.114
Frightening things.

58:32.412 --> 58:34.120
- It'll be fun!
- Watching tennis?

58:34.206 --> 58:37.373
Henry's dad's got a box.
There's gonna be a whole group of us.

58:37.460 --> 58:40.710
Another day with that type of person
and I'd chew my hands off!

58:40.797 --> 58:43.169
- Right. I'm coming round.
- No. Stay where you are.

58:43.258 --> 58:45.216
You live next door to me.

58:45.302 --> 58:47.046
Don't you hate us?

58:47.138 --> 58:49.177
What are you talking about?

58:50.224 --> 58:52.550
We are appalling bitches, Charlotte!

58:53.687 --> 58:55.097
Shut up!

58:55.188 --> 58:56.932
You know why you can't see that?

58:57.024 --> 59:00.891
Because your head is stuck up
your incredibly tight privileged arse!

59:00.987 --> 59:02.945
We are horrible people!

59:19.551 --> 59:21.342
We're going...

59:42.453 --> 59:43.912
You're late.

59:44.998 --> 59:46.954
What were you doing?

59:50.003 --> 59:52.210
Wiping out my past.

59:53.882 --> 59:54.832
Good.

01:00:17.911 --> 01:00:20.319
Don't you think you've let him down?

01:00:20.414 --> 01:00:22.158
You started it.

01:00:22.833 --> 01:00:26.998
You come here with a little problem
and she'll turn it into a nightmare.

01:00:28.924 --> 01:00:30.668
I didn't mean those things.

01:00:30.801 --> 01:00:34.336
But if you tease someone like that,
they've every right to hate you.

01:00:34.430 --> 01:00:35.841
I know.

01:00:36.641 --> 01:00:38.218
He's your brother.

01:00:38.936 --> 01:00:41.012
He's not gonna forgive you so easily.

01:00:43.441 --> 01:00:47.025
Right now, you don't feel like
you deserve forgiveness. Right?

01:00:48.072 --> 01:00:49.696
Does she think she's helping?

01:00:49.824 --> 01:00:51.781
Do you still feel like hurting yourself?

01:00:51.867 --> 01:00:54.073
- She doesn't care.
- I'm too tired to think.

01:01:00.961 --> 01:01:02.918
They're all going to beat you again.

01:01:04.257 --> 01:01:06.214
And when you think they've stopped,

01:01:06.301 --> 01:01:08.258
they're gonna start over.

01:01:09.972 --> 01:01:12.011
You take control of your destiny.

01:01:12.099 --> 01:01:13.808
Do you understand?

01:01:14.853 --> 01:01:17.178
- This is wrong.
- By ending your life...

01:01:17.272 --> 01:01:20.059
- What is?
-..you're fighting that shit.

01:01:20.150 --> 01:01:22.227
You're only taking the piss out of him.

01:01:24.531 --> 01:01:26.073
Of course I am.

01:02:24.017 --> 01:02:25.393
Jim?

01:02:25.477 --> 01:02:27.304
Who's going to be fastest?

01:02:28.189 --> 01:02:30.228
Definitely mine.

01:02:33.653 --> 01:02:35.195
Beautiful boys.

01:02:44.750 --> 01:02:49.045
I know the patterns of what may happen.
I advise as best I can.

01:02:50.214 --> 01:02:52.172
But why is the room hidden?

01:02:53.676 --> 01:02:57.971
Some kids arrive at a decision where
they feel they can't escape depression.

01:02:59.684 --> 01:03:01.226
It's a safe room.

01:03:02.395 --> 01:03:04.055
To commit suicide.

01:03:09.404 --> 01:03:11.562
Have you had suicidal feelings lately?

01:03:21.417 --> 01:03:22.616
Yeah.

01:03:25.130 --> 01:03:27.087
So what keeps you living?

01:03:30.761 --> 01:03:32.719
We cook him a few days.

01:03:33.848 --> 01:03:35.807
Let him wallow a little more.

01:03:39.147 --> 01:03:41.104
And then he'll fall apart.

01:03:42.275 --> 01:03:44.184
And that's all you're trying to do?

01:03:44.277 --> 01:03:45.855
Well, of course.

01:03:50.577 --> 01:03:52.036
But why?

01:04:03.676 --> 01:04:04.921
He...

01:04:07.388 --> 01:04:09.630
He just reminds me
of a boy I used to know.

01:04:12.977 --> 01:04:13.974
This...

01:04:15.940 --> 01:04:19.107
..lonely, nothing of a boy,
and I really hate that memory.

01:04:23.532 --> 01:04:25.109
Where are you?

01:04:27.202 --> 01:04:28.781
Right now?

01:04:30.706 --> 01:04:32.451
In my bedroom.

01:04:43.222 --> 01:04:45.179
You're lonely, aren't you?

01:04:49.521 --> 01:04:50.718
Yeah.

01:04:53.024 --> 01:04:54.484
And you?

01:04:58.239 --> 01:04:59.698
A little.

01:05:03.536 --> 01:05:05.494
Are you a happy person, William?

01:05:12.922 --> 01:05:14.880
I'm not a happy person, at all.

01:05:19.681 --> 01:05:21.223
But right now...

01:05:25.855 --> 01:05:27.813
Right at this moment with you...

01:05:34.198 --> 01:05:36.156
I've never been happier.

01:06:26.009 --> 01:06:27.967
Welcome. Welcome, everyone.

01:06:29.267 --> 01:06:31.241
The Ripley Time Traveller books

01:06:31.341 --> 01:06:34.472
are beloved by
so many people around the world.

01:06:34.510 --> 01:06:37.231
She really is an extraordinary writer.

01:06:37.980 --> 01:06:41.066
So, ladies and gentlemen,
the woman herself, my mother,

01:06:41.777 --> 01:06:43.520
Grace Rollins.

01:06:45.156 --> 01:06:46.948
Thanks, Ripley.

01:06:48.911 --> 01:06:51.069
This is the eighth and...

01:06:51.163 --> 01:06:53.286
final book in the series.

01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:58.038
I started writing these stories
to read to my boys

01:06:58.130 --> 01:07:01.546
and it just seems right
to have it here in our home.

01:07:02.677 --> 01:07:05.512
I'd like to thank our friends
for all your support,

01:07:05.596 --> 01:07:07.554
in the last year in particular.

01:07:09.350 --> 01:07:11.640
My family means everything to me.

01:07:12.897 --> 01:07:15.519
I'm so proud of the two boys.

01:07:16.693 --> 01:07:18.437
To have them healthy,

01:07:18.529 --> 01:07:20.735
to have them here with me today,

01:07:20.822 --> 01:07:22.567
it's a wonderful thing.

01:07:23.701 --> 01:07:26.488
They're completely embarrassed,
but still...

01:07:27.539 --> 01:07:29.578
To Paul, William and Ripley.

01:07:30.626 --> 01:07:32.037
Thank you.

01:07:39.093 --> 01:07:40.921
Well done.

01:08:05.375 --> 01:08:06.918
How are you?

01:08:11.966 --> 01:08:14.125
Can I introduce you to someone, Grace?

01:08:16.470 --> 01:08:18.429
It's fine. Go ahead. Really.

01:08:19.183 --> 01:08:20.594
I love you.

01:08:45.881 --> 01:08:47.340
No. Jim, stop!

01:08:49.635 --> 01:08:51.214
We need to talk.

01:08:52.264 --> 01:08:53.889
What is that?

01:08:56.810 --> 01:08:58.389
- What we said...
- No.

01:08:58.479 --> 01:09:00.685
- No, no, no.
- Give it to me. Do it!

01:09:00.814 --> 01:09:02.095
I need to...

01:09:02.192 --> 01:09:04.149
I need to talk to Mum. OK. Just...

01:09:05.279 --> 01:09:08.234
I need to go. I've got to stop
what I'm doing. OK. Where is she?

01:09:08.323 --> 01:09:10.399
You stay in your room and out of sight.

01:09:10.493 --> 01:09:12.154
You've been nothing but a fuck-up!

01:09:12.245 --> 01:09:13.407
No, no, no.

01:09:13.537 --> 01:09:14.487
No!

01:09:43.407 --> 01:09:44.403
Jim.

01:09:49.580 --> 01:09:51.620
Are you ready for your therapy now?

01:09:55.504 --> 01:09:57.461
We're all waiting for you.

01:10:02.262 --> 01:10:04.006
Yes, William.

01:10:09.062 --> 01:10:13.309
Born in the hope of shaking his father
from his unipolar depression.

01:10:13.400 --> 01:10:16.900
Born to a mother who dresses him up
as the perfect entertainment.

01:10:18.197 --> 01:10:20.154
The rugby. The fencing.

01:10:20.241 --> 01:10:22.199
The archery.

01:10:22.952 --> 01:10:24.910
Daddy, are you happy with me now?

01:10:26.039 --> 01:10:27.997
Are you happy now, Daddy?

01:10:29.502 --> 01:10:31.246
Oh, no, what have I done?

01:10:32.297 --> 01:10:36.166
He decides to stay indoors,
praying for a sibling to play with.

01:10:37.220 --> 01:10:39.461
But a fruitless year of shooting blanks

01:10:39.556 --> 01:10:44.264
and punctual periods sends his father
further into an unstoppable depression.

01:10:44.353 --> 01:10:46.560
Oh! Oh! Useless!

01:10:46.647 --> 01:10:48.226
Oh! Oh!

01:10:48.317 --> 01:10:52.314
But I don't want another child
like that miserable boy.

01:10:52.404 --> 01:10:55.571
He's making me worse.
I can't even look at him, I tell you.

01:10:56.442 --> 01:10:59.769
One terrible day,
his father left him in the zoo,

01:10:59.784 --> 01:11:01.869
leaving his family in the poo.

01:11:01.957 --> 01:11:04.911
You have pushed me over the edge, boy!
I'm out of here!

01:11:06.587 --> 01:11:09.921
On the day of the first anniversary
of his father's disappearance,

01:11:10.008 --> 01:11:11.751
the boy takes his very first Valium.

01:11:12.803 --> 01:11:14.297
He's aged eight.

01:11:14.388 --> 01:11:16.346
I'm eight and a half, actually.

01:11:16.432 --> 01:11:19.884
The pills go a little way to quietening
the voices in his head,

01:11:19.978 --> 01:11:23.811
but, in his soul, he knows that
he's to blame for his daddy's downfall,

01:11:23.899 --> 01:11:25.892
his daddy's disappearance,

01:11:25.985 --> 01:11:27.942
his daddy's probable death.

01:11:29.698 --> 01:11:32.569
Like every other sad,
misguided fool on the planet,

01:11:32.660 --> 01:11:36.444
he tries to find some answers
in the World Wide Web.

01:11:38.374 --> 01:11:40.533
Hey, man! Woo-hoo!

01:11:40.628 --> 01:11:43.379
Go, USA! Yeah, man, I'm gonna do it!

01:11:45.883 --> 01:11:47.841
Like others in the suicide club,

01:11:47.928 --> 01:11:49.885
he reaches a moment of clarity.

01:11:50.889 --> 01:11:53.345
Oh, maybe I should kill myself.

01:11:53.434 --> 01:11:56.470
I'm sorry I was born
and made you sicker, Daddy.

01:11:56.604 --> 01:11:58.562
It's all been my fault.

01:11:58.648 --> 01:12:01.186
And I'm sorry I drove you away, Daddy.

01:12:01.276 --> 01:12:03.566
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Daddy!

01:12:03.655 --> 01:12:05.065
I'm sorry!

01:12:14.959 --> 01:12:19.668
To see it condensed like that
is always gonna be difficult.

01:12:21.925 --> 01:12:24.382
Jim's got to turn his depression

01:12:24.469 --> 01:12:27.008
into an act with some sort of expression.

01:12:28.141 --> 01:12:29.885
I can see what you're doing.

01:12:31.103 --> 01:12:35.647
Only me and Jim have
any appreciation for what's going on.

01:12:36.986 --> 01:12:39.144
You have no idea what I'm doing.

01:12:39.947 --> 01:12:41.904
This is about Jim purging,

01:12:41.991 --> 01:12:43.700
about killing his past.

01:12:43.785 --> 01:12:45.362
That was so cruel.

01:12:45.453 --> 01:12:48.123
It's a well-documented psychotherapy, Emily.

01:12:48.207 --> 01:12:49.784
Yeah? It works.

01:12:49.875 --> 01:12:51.833
- What makes you the expert?
- Oh, shut up.

01:12:51.919 --> 01:12:53.828
What do you know about depression?

01:12:53.921 --> 01:12:56.247
You've written a book on mental illness?

01:12:56.341 --> 01:12:58.299
My mother killed herself, Mo.

01:13:03.725 --> 01:13:05.468
She was just like...

01:13:05.560 --> 01:13:06.759
Jim...

01:13:07.813 --> 01:13:09.557
..and his dad.

01:13:14.820 --> 01:13:16.896
I've lived with it
for the last two years.

01:13:19.953 --> 01:13:21.410
I know how...

01:13:21.495 --> 01:13:23.239
devastating it is.

01:13:32.467 --> 01:13:33.961
I imagine...

01:13:36.472 --> 01:13:38.428
..my mum coming into my room...

01:13:39.850 --> 01:13:41.014
..and...

01:13:41.144 --> 01:13:43.101
finding me lying there.

01:13:48.861 --> 01:13:50.819
Every day she must look at me...

01:13:52.615 --> 01:13:54.275
..and think of my dad.

01:14:00.499 --> 01:14:02.575
I need to do what's right
for both of us.

01:14:07.340 --> 01:14:09.133
I need to finish this.

01:14:42.465 --> 01:14:47.044
I think it's about time I met him.
Put him out of his misery.

01:14:54.855 --> 01:14:56.599
You're trying to kill him.

01:14:56.691 --> 01:14:58.434
"'Assist his suicide."

01:14:59.360 --> 01:15:01.400
It's a different thing entirely.

01:15:04.825 --> 01:15:06.568
And we're all implicated.

01:15:08.579 --> 01:15:10.536
That's why we're here.

01:15:11.666 --> 01:15:13.624
Why you've been friends with me.

01:15:15.629 --> 01:15:17.682
Oh, you didn't think I actually cared
about

01:15:17.683 --> 01:15:20.671
your little identity crisis, did you?

01:15:20.760 --> 01:15:23.252
I mean,
cos you've got such a difficult life.

01:15:30.271 --> 01:15:32.311
Trying to figure out a way
of stopping this?

01:15:34.527 --> 01:15:36.484
There are people I could call.

01:15:36.570 --> 01:15:37.815
Oh?

01:15:38.864 --> 01:15:40.276
No need to.

01:15:41.326 --> 01:15:43.283
Not when they're calling on you.

01:15:48.793 --> 01:15:50.870
Hello, Ushi. What's the matter?

01:15:50.963 --> 01:15:53.334
Why don't you ask that bitch
of a daughter?

01:15:56.802 --> 01:15:58.760
Is Eva in, sir?

01:16:02.142 --> 01:16:03.092
Eva?

01:16:03.977 --> 01:16:05.769
Come down now.

01:16:19.329 --> 01:16:21.368
Jim?

01:16:22.333 --> 01:16:24.290
Can you open the door?

01:16:28.465 --> 01:16:30.422
I'm worried. Come on.

01:16:33.470 --> 01:16:35.012
Are you OK?

01:16:37.476 --> 01:16:39.017
I'm fine.

01:16:40.061 --> 01:16:41.640
Just go.

01:16:56.038 --> 01:16:57.996
I've got something to give you.

01:16:58.083 --> 01:17:00.122
You choose where to meet.

01:17:05.841 --> 01:17:07.300
Dead Ripley.

01:17:13.558 --> 01:17:15.303
Stop this please, Jim.

01:17:15.394 --> 01:17:17.684
This isn't what you want. It can't be!

01:17:17.773 --> 01:17:20.525
William's been lying to you,
to all of us.

01:17:20.609 --> 01:17:24.109
What he said about his mother,
she never killed herself. Look!

01:17:26.699 --> 01:17:28.989
Look atyour own mother. Right?

01:17:29.078 --> 01:17:30.488
Yeah, I suppose.

01:17:31.538 --> 01:17:33.864
Mine's a spoilt cow, I swear.

01:17:38.087 --> 01:17:40.081
I don't know why he's doing it, but...

01:17:41.049 --> 01:17:43.007
..William wants you dead.

01:17:43.094 --> 01:17:44.837
I can see it.

01:17:46.055 --> 01:17:49.389
You think I'll take advice
from a wannabe-paedophile, Mo?

01:17:51.020 --> 01:17:54.555
If you had any conscience,
you'd take a gun to your own sick head.

01:18:01.281 --> 01:18:03.025
I'm here to help you, Jim.

01:18:04.744 --> 01:18:07.864
You'd better pray
that when William is finished with me

01:18:07.956 --> 01:18:12.868
he'll have the energy and dedication
to annihilate a prick like you.

01:18:16.925 --> 01:18:18.467
It's you, right?

01:18:23.600 --> 01:18:25.344
You get in my way...

01:18:26.478 --> 01:18:28.850
..and I'll make your life hell.

01:18:30.857 --> 01:18:32.401
I've gotta do something.

01:18:32.485 --> 01:18:35.320
- Like what?
- Find Jim. Tell him what's happening!

01:18:36.489 --> 01:18:38.613
You're not gonna be able to do that, Mo.

01:18:40.661 --> 01:18:42.036
Why not?

01:18:42.121 --> 01:18:44.079
Cos I'm in your system.

01:18:46.793 --> 01:18:48.537
And I'll wipe it out.

01:19:08.818 --> 01:19:10.563
Get out of here! Move! Quick!

01:19:14.159 --> 01:19:15.903
We need to get to Jim today.

01:19:15.994 --> 01:19:18.664
Where can we meet?
We have to get back to the city.

01:19:18.747 --> 01:19:21.369
- What's happening to my computer?
- It's William!

01:19:22.877 --> 01:19:23.707
Shit!

01:19:23.795 --> 01:19:25.753
Where can we meet? I need your help!

01:19:27.883 --> 01:19:29.840
Charing Cross Station. One o'clock.

01:20:29.497 --> 01:20:31.241
I need your help, Si.

01:21:03.328 --> 01:21:04.573
Hey.

01:21:04.664 --> 01:21:05.908
H-H-Hey.

01:21:05.998 --> 01:21:07.825
Hey, hey, hey. Erm...

01:21:09.586 --> 01:21:11.045
Who's he?

01:21:11.128 --> 01:21:13.086
The computer geek.

01:21:15.509 --> 01:21:18.261
- And how do we get to Jim?
- Take me to the room.

01:21:18.346 --> 01:21:21.300
Once we're inside his system,
we'll track Jim down.

01:21:22.517 --> 01:21:23.929
Dead Ripley.

01:21:36.033 --> 01:21:37.991
You choose where to meet.

01:21:41.331 --> 01:21:43.074
Where my dad left me.

01:21:45.544 --> 01:21:47.453
Hold it. Hold it. Two secs. Thank you.

01:21:47.547 --> 01:21:48.827
Let's go!

01:21:56.807 --> 01:21:59.133
William tried to do it before.

01:21:59.227 --> 01:22:03.855
He is surviving, in his own way,
but he'll respect Jim's wishes to die.

01:22:03.941 --> 01:22:05.483
Like I will.

01:22:05.568 --> 01:22:09.269
But this has nothing to do with
what Jim wants. William has broken him.

01:22:46.365 --> 01:22:47.777
Quick! Come on!

01:23:27.706 --> 01:23:29.664
- Let's get him online.
- Yeah.

01:23:58.325 --> 01:23:59.735
You got in somewhere?

01:23:59.869 --> 01:24:01.991
- You said you'd be with me.
- Well, I'm here now.

01:24:02.079 --> 01:24:04.119
- Open the envelope.
- Please don't do this.

01:24:04.207 --> 01:24:06.117
This is about me and Jim, Eva.

01:24:06.209 --> 01:24:07.787
You have no idea.

01:24:07.878 --> 01:24:09.420
Now get out!

01:24:42.752 --> 01:24:44.294
Your father.

01:24:44.379 --> 01:24:45.920
Your father...

01:24:47.049 --> 01:24:49.006
..leaving you, Jim.

01:24:52.555 --> 01:24:54.512
And what he thought of you.

01:24:58.020 --> 01:25:00.060
You can escape that.

01:25:19.086 --> 01:25:21.043
What you are about to do...

01:25:25.344 --> 01:25:26.541
Oh.

01:25:26.636 --> 01:25:28.594
You are a hero to me.

01:25:46.410 --> 01:25:47.359
Jim!

01:25:51.165 --> 01:25:53.622
- What is this place?
- He's killing you, Jim!

01:25:54.795 --> 01:25:56.419
- I'll do it in here. I'm ready.
- No!

01:25:56.504 --> 01:25:58.048
Please, please, Jim.

01:25:58.131 --> 01:26:01.335
You do it in this room and they'll
trace it back. It's not safe, Jim.

01:26:03.888 --> 01:26:05.846
You said you'd be here!

01:26:05.933 --> 01:26:07.391
You left me!

01:26:07.476 --> 01:26:08.578
Just stay where you are.

01:26:08.829 --> 01:26:10.810
Stay where you are
and I'll come and get you.

01:26:10.897 --> 01:26:14.645
This isn't right. I need to go home.
I need to be anywhere. I can't be here.

01:26:14.734 --> 01:26:16.775
- I need to leave.
- Run!

01:26:16.862 --> 01:26:18.486
Don't! Don't!

01:26:20.534 --> 01:26:21.992
Oh, you...

01:26:23.036 --> 01:26:24.614
No, you...

01:28:09.328 --> 01:28:10.276
Jim!

01:28:12.581 --> 01:28:14.538
Just leave me alone!

01:28:44.703 --> 01:28:45.651
Aah!

01:28:52.545 --> 01:28:54.870
Oi! You want some manners!

01:28:55.005 --> 01:28:56.500
Do you hear me?

01:29:03.515 --> 01:29:05.473
He's got a gun!

01:29:12.902 --> 01:29:14.859
Jim! What are you doing?

01:29:16.156 --> 01:29:18.694
Are you gonna do it?
You are gonna do this.

01:29:21.078 --> 01:29:25.077
Your father's hate for you, you're
never gonna be able to escape that.

01:29:25.167 --> 01:29:26.910
You pull that trigger...

01:29:27.044 --> 01:29:29.713
You pull this trigger,
you are killing him, Jim.

01:29:31.090 --> 01:29:32.632
Do it. Huh?

01:29:33.760 --> 01:29:35.420
Do it now. Do it.

01:29:35.512 --> 01:29:37.421
I know he didn't hate me, William.

01:29:37.514 --> 01:29:38.179
No.

01:29:38.265 --> 01:29:40.223
This isn't about me. It's about you.

01:29:40.309 --> 01:29:42.800
- It's about you.
- I'm trying to help you.

01:29:42.896 --> 01:29:44.555
I'm trying to help you.

01:29:44.647 --> 01:29:46.889
Oh, God, don't you understand?

01:29:48.985 --> 01:29:50.445
No.

01:29:55.117 --> 01:29:56.447
No, no.

01:30:01.417 --> 01:30:03.375
I really hope that hurt.

01:30:05.130 --> 01:30:06.839
Armed police! Get down!

01:30:06.923 --> 01:30:08.917
Get down! Get out of the way now!

01:30:09.009 --> 01:30:10.338
Clear the area!

01:30:12.930 --> 01:30:13.926
Shit.

01:30:16.726 --> 01:30:18.138
Clear the area!

01:30:20.398 --> 01:30:22.225
Armed police!

01:30:22.733 --> 01:30:24.726
Armed police! Stay where you are!

01:30:26.029 --> 01:30:27.986
Armed police! Stay where you are!

01:30:29.157 --> 01:30:30.701
Turn around.

01:30:30.785 --> 01:30:32.742
Now! Turn around.

01:30:33.996 --> 01:30:35.326
Do it!

01:30:35.416 --> 01:30:37.372
Turn around.

01:30:40.505 --> 01:30:42.461
Put the weapon down.
