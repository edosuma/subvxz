00:54.195 --> 00:55.315
Make way

00:55.391 --> 00:57.578
for the King of the Castle!

00:57.707 --> 01:00.281
Not if I get there first!

01:01.076 --> 01:03.176
I'm going to be King!

01:03.422 --> 01:04.569
Whoa!

01:06.036 --> 01:07.294
Guess what?

01:09.676 --> 01:12.301
I'm the Queen of the Castle!

01:12.325 --> 01:13.380
Milady.

01:17.128 --> 01:19.475
Attention.
Your princess is ready

01:19.514 --> 01:22.483
to show you
the new Throne of Barkingburg.

01:23.640 --> 01:26.218
I decorated it all by myself.

01:26.317 --> 01:27.858
Magnificent!

01:27.939 --> 01:29.709
Princess, your artistic touch

01:29.754 --> 01:31.850
Shines in every detail.

01:31.983 --> 01:34.624
Why, you've even adorned
the Throne's floor locks!

01:34.655 --> 01:35.686
Thank you.

01:35.796 --> 01:38.874
I've been working for
days to get it all just right.

01:39.022 --> 01:42.350
And one day, you shall
take your place on it as Queen,

01:42.452 --> 01:45.632
and everyone in
Barkingburg will listen to you.

01:45.843 --> 01:48.202
That Throne is
all I've ever wanted!

01:48.366 --> 01:51.647
Especially the part about
having everyone listen to me!

01:51.772 --> 01:54.772
Oh, I just can't stop myself!

01:57.245 --> 01:58.772
Silly Sweetie.

01:58.944 --> 02:01.179
You know you
don't belong up there.

02:01.288 --> 02:03.288
I'm sorry, my princess.

02:03.444 --> 02:05.366
It's so beautiful.

02:05.491 --> 02:07.350
I had to take a closer look.

02:07.507 --> 02:10.452
Can we at least
take a picture of it?

02:10.616 --> 02:12.530
What a lovely idea!

02:12.633 --> 02:14.163
I'll get the camera.

02:14.230 --> 02:17.030
I've already arranged for it.

02:18.694 --> 02:21.679
You are such a thoughtful pup.

02:23.077 --> 02:24.804
There.
I've got the Throne

02:24.890 --> 02:26.264
just the way I want it.

02:26.352 --> 02:27.538
Get ready, Busby.

02:27.624 --> 02:30.952
It's finally time to
put my plan into action.

02:31.077 --> 02:33.389
You may take the picture now.

02:36.024 --> 02:37.686
Dear! What happened?!

02:37.773 --> 02:39.733
Sweetie? Are you all right?

02:41.000 --> 02:47.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:48.991 --> 02:51.052
I can't see anything!

02:55.711 --> 02:57.654
We've done it, Busby!

02:57.917 --> 02:59.591
We've got the Royal Throne!

02:59.845 --> 03:03.013
If a pup like me
can't be Queen here,

03:03.161 --> 03:06.622
This Throne will
make me Queen somewhere else.

03:06.730 --> 03:08.841
Cheerio, crow!

03:12.393 --> 03:14.983
Hey!
Shoo, shoo!

03:17.261 --> 03:18.261
No!

03:18.350 --> 03:21.092
Now I'll have to find another
way to get my precious Throne

03:21.136 --> 03:22.553
out of Barkingburg.

03:24.108 --> 03:26.436
Sweetie!
Where are you?!

03:26.512 --> 03:29.406
My poor,
defenseless poochie is gone!

03:30.016 --> 03:32.030
As well as the Royal Throne!

03:33.104 --> 03:35.639
How can you become
Queen without the Throne?

03:35.693 --> 03:36.951
I can't!

03:37.021 --> 03:39.702
And I so liked the
way I decorated it, too.

03:39.782 --> 03:41.288
For something this important,

03:41.394 --> 03:43.639
There's only
one thing we can do.

03:43.845 --> 03:45.655
Call the Paw Patrol!

03:46.789 --> 03:47.819
Perfect.

03:47.902 --> 03:51.288
Now I know how
I'll move my Throne.

03:55.338 --> 03:56.478
Okay, pups.

03:56.517 --> 04:00.080
Who's ready for some...

04:01.652 --> 04:03.237
Guess you all are.

04:03.964 --> 04:05.361
The Earl of Barkingburg?

04:05.429 --> 04:07.126
Is everything
okay, your Earlness?

04:07.189 --> 04:08.783
<i>I'm afraid not, Ryder.</i>

04:08.891 --> 04:09.908
<i>Someone has taken</i>

04:09.939 --> 04:12.892
<i>the most important
treasure of Barkingburg!</i>

04:12.971 --> 04:14.658
<i>The Royal Throne!</i>

04:14.769 --> 04:16.774
<i>And my precious pup, Sweetie!</i>

04:16.855 --> 04:20.822
<i>If you can't find her,
I shall never smile again.</i>

04:21.015 --> 04:23.111
Don't worry!
We're on our way.

04:23.184 --> 04:25.744
No job is too big,
no pup is too small.

04:25.824 --> 04:26.954
Paw Patrol,

04:27.089 --> 04:28.791
to the Air Patroller!

04:29.120 --> 04:30.994
Ryder needs us!

04:31.096 --> 04:32.822
Wait for me!

04:32.980 --> 04:35.072
Whoa!

04:35.650 --> 04:37.588
Hey, this is fun!

04:37.816 --> 04:39.838
Whoo-hoo!

04:40.767 --> 04:43.533
Marshall, slow down!

04:43.775 --> 04:45.435
Whoa-oh-oh-oh!

04:47.544 --> 04:50.163
Now I'm King of the Castle!

04:56.855 --> 05:00.808
Paw Patrol, ready
for action, Ryder, sir.

05:00.894 --> 05:04.222
Jolly good pups because
we're heading to Barkingburg.

05:04.433 --> 05:07.714
Someone took the Royal
Throne and the Royal pup.

05:08.815 --> 05:10.097
An extraordinary mission

05:10.183 --> 05:12.659
like this calls
for extraordinary gear.

05:12.713 --> 05:14.675
Sounds like this is a...

05:14.776 --> 05:16.425
Mission Paw!

05:17.010 --> 05:19.800
Robo-dog,
put us in stealth mode.

05:43.194 --> 05:44.288
Whoo!

05:44.366 --> 05:47.210
This way to gear
up, Mission Paw style!

06:04.070 --> 06:05.438
Okay, pups.

06:06.149 --> 06:08.305
Our Mission Paw is
to find the missing Throne

06:08.422 --> 06:09.938
And the princess' pup.

06:10.016 --> 06:12.313
Sweetie's
always up to something.

06:12.477 --> 06:15.375
I bet if we find her,
we find the Throne, too.

06:15.524 --> 06:17.477
We won't know
until we start looking.

06:17.625 --> 06:20.406
So, for this
Mission Paw, I'll need Rocky.

06:20.492 --> 06:22.250
You'll use your radar scanner

06:22.321 --> 06:24.375
to look for any
clues in the Throne room.

06:24.500 --> 06:26.469
Green means go!

06:26.664 --> 06:30.227
Skye, use your sky cycle
to scout the Castle from above.

06:30.391 --> 06:32.805
This puppy's gotta fly!

06:32.977 --> 06:35.649

07:25.590 --> 07:26.817
Captain Busby,

07:26.918 --> 07:28.340
Prepare for take-off.

07:31.231 --> 07:32.301
Paw Patrol!

07:32.379 --> 07:33.614
Thank goodness you're here

07:33.676 --> 07:37.082
to find my Throne
and my missing Sweetie.

07:37.192 --> 07:40.489
Rocky, head inside and see what
you can find in the Throne room.

07:40.598 --> 07:41.754
On it!

07:41.856 --> 07:42.965
Radar scanner.

07:49.930 --> 07:52.953
Nothing suspicious yet.

07:55.781 --> 07:56.875
Hey!

07:56.914 --> 07:59.211
I found a secret
panel in the ceiling!

07:59.313 --> 08:01.469
Maybe the Throne
thief snuck out that way!

08:01.554 --> 08:02.797
Thanks, Rocky!

08:02.849 --> 08:04.867
Skye, time for aerial recon.

08:04.992 --> 08:06.297
Start with the Castle roof.

08:06.406 --> 08:09.383
<i>This pup's going up!</i>

08:12.756 --> 08:13.992
That's strange.

08:14.046 --> 08:17.305
My pup pad's telling me the
Air Patroller just took off.

08:17.484 --> 08:19.125
But who's flying it?

08:19.477 --> 08:21.969
I see the Throne!
It's on the roof!

08:22.094 --> 08:24.013
But no sign of Sweetie.

08:24.232 --> 08:25.530
Huh?!

08:25.944 --> 08:27.778
What's the
Air Patroller doing here?

08:27.872 --> 08:30.318
Whoa!

08:32.443 --> 08:35.561
Ryder, the Air Patroller
took the Throne!

08:35.662 --> 08:38.333
Stay on its tail until
we figure out what's going on!

08:38.467 --> 08:40.256
Roger that!

08:44.131 --> 08:46.695
Ryder!
The thief is Sweetie!

08:46.765 --> 08:51.523
Ahem, that's Queen
Sweetie because I now have

08:51.570 --> 08:53.593
The Throne of Barkingburg,

08:53.718 --> 08:55.617
And my autopilot, Busby,

08:55.734 --> 08:58.695
is going to fly me
to my very own kingdom.

08:58.788 --> 09:01.304
<i>I'll be the
Queen of wherever I land.</i>

09:02.960 --> 09:04.101
That pup!

09:04.202 --> 09:06.734
Someone's not getting
her belly rubbed tonight.

09:06.851 --> 09:09.351
Mission Paw is
on your tail, Sweetie!

09:09.460 --> 09:11.609
Skye, stay with
the Air Patroller!

09:11.687 --> 09:13.023
Trying my best,

09:13.070 --> 09:15.023
But it's super fast.

09:15.148 --> 09:17.952
Robo-dog, don't let
it out of your sight.

09:30.923 --> 09:32.228
She's behind us!

09:32.322 --> 09:33.431
Captain Busby!

09:33.540 --> 09:37.931
Let's lose that
Canine and her copter!

09:40.189 --> 09:42.329
Whoa, whoa!

09:42.511 --> 09:43.837
Whoa!

09:43.978 --> 09:45.189
Whew.

09:47.306 --> 09:48.509
Are you okay, Skye?

09:48.587 --> 09:50.572
<i>Yeah, but that was a close one.</i>

09:50.626 --> 09:52.423
Did you see which
direction she went?

09:52.540 --> 09:55.408
<i>It looks like
she headed southwest.</i>

09:57.095 --> 09:59.626
If she's going that way...

09:59.720 --> 10:02.587
She's taking the
Air Patroller to the jungle!

10:02.743 --> 10:04.009
Hit it, Robo-dog!

10:13.013 --> 10:16.224
I don't have a shovel,
Carlos, but I'll help you dig.

10:16.310 --> 10:20.365
Tracker, you could
be an archaeologist pup!

10:21.599 --> 10:24.021
I hear something.

10:25.854 --> 10:27.909
I don't hear any...

10:28.834 --> 10:30.545
Airplane, wow!

10:30.693 --> 10:32.638
Tracker, great ears!

10:32.717 --> 10:34.873
Isn't that the Air Patroller?

10:35.037 --> 10:38.029
Yeah, that's the
Paw badge on the back!

10:38.622 --> 10:39.661
Cool!

10:39.717 --> 10:42.287
It sounds like
they're landing Alli.

10:42.396 --> 10:44.084
Vamos!

10:51.868 --> 10:54.571
Greetings, loyal subjects.

10:54.728 --> 10:58.642
I am Queen Sweetie,
your new ruler!

11:00.150 --> 11:01.230
As your Queen,

11:01.275 --> 11:04.728
I command you to give me
all of your precious gems.

11:07.017 --> 11:09.486
Okay, I'll take bananas.

11:09.962 --> 11:13.165
Queen Sweetie deserves
the greatest banana collection

11:13.190 --> 11:14.294
in the world!

11:17.196 --> 11:18.713
That's not Ryder

11:18.829 --> 11:20.595
Or any of our Amigos.

11:20.759 --> 11:23.657
But that's definitely
the Air Patroller.

11:23.767 --> 11:25.712
Something's going on.

11:26.095 --> 11:27.657
I better pup tag Ryder.

11:27.814 --> 11:29.219
Ryder!

11:29.329 --> 11:31.282
<i>Soy yo tracker, where are you?</i>

11:31.307 --> 11:33.978
We're just
heading into the jungle.

11:34.157 --> 11:35.415
<i>Well, your Air Patroller's</i>

11:35.478 --> 11:37.595
<i>already here
at the monkey temple.</i>

11:37.682 --> 11:39.111
<i>With a pup we don't know!</i>

11:39.228 --> 11:40.376
Thanks for the tip.

11:40.446 --> 11:43.564
Please keep an eye on her, and
let us know what she's up to.

11:43.661 --> 11:46.798
We'll be there soon!

11:50.428 --> 11:52.029
Yuck!

11:52.255 --> 11:55.240
I guess I don't
really like bananas,

11:55.313 --> 11:58.537
But I do like having all of them

11:58.709 --> 12:01.108
Because I'm
Queen of the monkeys!

12:01.219 --> 12:03.873
Now, carry me into the temple!

12:11.639 --> 12:14.717
What do you mean
you're the monkey Queen?!

12:14.835 --> 12:16.335
You may have the crown,

12:16.671 --> 12:18.662
But I have the Throne!

12:18.990 --> 12:23.115
Now, move your
Sweetie into a new Castle.

12:28.308 --> 12:29.756
Oyoyoy!

12:29.867 --> 12:30.967
Los monos!

12:31.044 --> 12:32.537
They're taking sides!

12:32.635 --> 12:34.326
Monkey minions!

12:34.359 --> 12:35.626
Push harder!

12:54.618 --> 12:55.952
Monkeys, cuidado!

12:56.318 --> 12:57.717
Get away from those statues!

12:57.819 --> 13:00.686
Ryder, we have
to stop those statues

13:00.780 --> 13:02.084
from falling on the monkeys!

13:02.131 --> 13:03.155
We're on!

13:03.187 --> 13:04.256
The Paw Patrol?

13:04.319 --> 13:06.334
Time to abandon kingdom.

13:06.437 --> 13:09.248
Monkey subjects,
to the Air Patroller!

13:09.434 --> 13:10.760
Okay, tracker.

13:10.898 --> 13:12.635
Use your cables
to fly Chase's winch

13:12.677 --> 13:14.862
up to the top of that palm tree!

13:14.909 --> 13:16.932
Let's go, tracker!

13:18.268 --> 13:19.690
Cables!

13:21.853 --> 13:25.065
Winch!

13:32.242 --> 13:33.383
It's ready!

13:33.491 --> 13:35.790
Winch, retract!

13:41.478 --> 13:43.039
Thanks, Ryder.

13:43.220 --> 13:45.017
Hey, guys?

13:45.331 --> 13:47.588
Sweetie's getting away!

13:51.118 --> 13:54.072
Wow, I haven't
even tripped once!

13:55.036 --> 13:56.216
Whoa!

13:58.005 --> 13:59.959
I'm good!

14:01.669 --> 14:04.239
That sneaky
Sweetie got away again!

14:04.542 --> 14:05.700
Sorry, Ryder.

14:05.754 --> 14:06.919
It's okay, Marshall.

14:06.982 --> 14:08.382
We'll catch her next time.

14:08.431 --> 14:09.700
Let's ride!

14:10.001 --> 14:11.504
Good luck, Paw Patrol!

14:11.575 --> 14:14.356
<i>Buena Suerte, Amigos!</i>

14:17.106 --> 14:19.734
<i>Ryder, have you
found my Throne yet?</i>

14:19.911 --> 14:22.333
We did, but
Sweetie got away again.

14:22.439 --> 14:23.794
<i>Oh, that pup.</i>

14:23.903 --> 14:26.200
<i>No more handbag
of treats for her.</i>

14:26.296 --> 14:28.278
Don't worry.
We're still on her trail.

14:28.411 --> 14:30.340
I saw her flying
the Air Patroller south,

14:30.426 --> 14:32.997
And there's only one
thing in that direction.

14:39.457 --> 14:41.270
Greetings, loyal subjects.

14:41.431 --> 14:43.543
I'm Queen... whoa!

14:50.647 --> 14:51.676
Yuck!

14:51.740 --> 14:53.746
I can't stand fish!

14:53.864 --> 14:59.278
My first Royal rule
is never give your ruler fish.

15:00.074 --> 15:02.692
And now, for
my first Royal command.

15:02.840 --> 15:06.129
Build your beloved
Queen an ice Castle!

15:06.355 --> 15:09.082
The most magnificent
Castle ever seen

15:09.129 --> 15:10.153
in...

15:11.527 --> 15:14.239
the south Sweetie pole!

15:19.974 --> 15:22.326
This looks a little
too flat for snowboarding.

15:22.428 --> 15:25.809
Yeah, but it's
great for penguin watching!

15:26.474 --> 15:27.835
It looks like
there's a whole bunch

15:27.865 --> 15:29.826
of our flipper-y
friends over there!

15:29.851 --> 15:30.856
Oh, yeah!

15:30.881 --> 15:32.974
Over there,
by the Air Patroller!

15:33.253 --> 15:34.522
Air Patroller?!

15:34.766 --> 15:36.849
But where's Ryder
and the Paw Patrol?

15:36.935 --> 15:39.987
And look at those penguins
pushing ice around that pup!

15:40.162 --> 15:41.974
I'll pup tag
Ryder and see what's up.

15:42.028 --> 15:44.348
And I'll go say
hi to our new friend!

15:44.879 --> 15:46.838
Whoo-hoo!

15:48.586 --> 15:51.500
Oh, oh, oh!
Don't forget the drawbridge!

15:51.669 --> 15:53.719
Howdy.
Name's Jake.

15:53.797 --> 15:56.047
So, uh, where's Ryder?

15:56.203 --> 15:59.586
Oh, uh, he
let me have his plane.

15:59.664 --> 16:00.687
It's okay.

16:00.758 --> 16:01.828
I'm a Queen.

16:01.853 --> 16:02.883
See?

16:02.921 --> 16:05.078
This is my Royal ice Castle.

16:05.289 --> 16:09.000
And I command you, tall
person, to help finish it.

16:10.109 --> 16:11.891
You're a funny pup.

16:12.266 --> 16:14.750
Go on.
The work won't finish itself.

16:14.892 --> 16:16.078
Uh, okay.

16:16.151 --> 16:17.898
Always glad to help.

16:19.008 --> 16:21.945
So that's what the
Air Patroller is doing here.

16:22.063 --> 16:23.476
That pup took it!

16:23.585 --> 16:25.601
Along with the Throne of Barkingburg!

16:25.665 --> 16:27.875
She wants to use it
to set up her own kingdom.

16:28.086 --> 16:29.328
Can you help us get it back?

16:29.453 --> 16:31.820
Ice or snow, I'm ready to go!

16:31.905 --> 16:33.539
Great!
We're on our way.

16:33.711 --> 16:36.039
Just don't let Sweetie
take off until we get there.

16:36.226 --> 16:37.586
Jake and I won't let you down!

16:38.723 --> 16:40.101
Rocky, it's time for you

16:40.141 --> 16:42.539
to do some
extraordinary gadget making.

16:42.609 --> 16:45.359
We need a device that will take
control of the Air Patroller.

16:45.516 --> 16:48.930
Wow, good thing we travel
with a lot of spare parts!

16:49.060 --> 16:52.398
'cause I don't
lose it, I reuse it!

16:58.064 --> 16:59.423
Bigger!
Bigger!

16:59.509 --> 17:03.710
I want the biggest, most
magnificent ice Castle ever!

17:04.329 --> 17:05.720
Oh, hi, Everest!

17:05.789 --> 17:07.589
Wanna help us
make an ice Castle?

17:09.203 --> 17:11.273
I'm playing
along so I can figure out

17:11.342 --> 17:12.492
What she's up to!

17:12.587 --> 17:14.001
She's up to no good.

17:14.173 --> 17:17.892
Jake, that pup took the
Air Patroller and that Throne.

17:18.001 --> 17:20.884
We've got to stall her
till the Paw Patrol gets here!

17:20.953 --> 17:22.095
Hello!

17:22.134 --> 17:24.938
There are no breaks
in the South Sweetie Pole.

17:25.017 --> 17:26.134
Okey dokey, Sweetie.

17:26.182 --> 17:30.228
Queen Sweetie, or
your most gracious Majesty.

17:30.360 --> 17:33.040
Let's push this ice
chunk so it blocks her in!

17:33.106 --> 17:34.368
Good plan!

17:34.639 --> 17:36.636
Lend a flipper, penguins!

17:39.816 --> 17:41.667
Hey, I can't get out!

17:41.808 --> 17:44.566
I command you to
build a Castle back door!

17:44.698 --> 17:46.292
Sorry, meanie Queenie,

17:46.362 --> 17:49.183
You're staying there
till the Paw Patrol gets here!

17:49.278 --> 17:51.253
I don't think so.

17:52.644 --> 17:53.720
Claw!

17:53.745 --> 17:57.144
Fresh fish to the first
penguin who builds a staircase

17:57.212 --> 18:00.003
That helps your Queen get out!

18:04.247 --> 18:05.324
Whoa!

18:05.462 --> 18:06.769
She played the fish card!

18:06.811 --> 18:07.977
Uh-oh!

18:08.088 --> 18:11.207
That Castle is
getting too heavy for this ice!

18:11.334 --> 18:14.379
Penguins, no!
The ice is going to break!

18:14.477 --> 18:17.445
Get away from that Castle!

18:17.596 --> 18:18.796
Whoa!

18:18.954 --> 18:21.588
Penguins
should not build Castles!

18:23.380 --> 18:24.547
Come on, little fella!

18:24.608 --> 18:25.616
I'll save you!

18:26.742 --> 18:27.826
Whoa!

18:28.048 --> 18:30.022
my Throne!

18:30.202 --> 18:32.452
I'll get it back
with the Air Patroller!

18:32.639 --> 18:36.108
Jake, penguins can
swim in freezing cold water!

18:36.200 --> 18:37.584
You can't!

18:37.723 --> 18:38.723
Oh, yeah!

18:38.789 --> 18:40.038
Whoa!

18:40.473 --> 18:42.022
That was close!

18:42.123 --> 18:43.256
I'll get you!

18:43.281 --> 18:44.333
Everest!

18:44.358 --> 18:46.983
You've got to stop
Sweetie before she takes off!

18:47.077 --> 18:49.176
I'm okay.
You can get me later!

18:50.285 --> 18:52.405
Snowboard!

19:07.039 --> 19:08.326
Sorry, Ryder.

19:08.432 --> 19:10.391
We stalled her
as long as we could.

19:10.471 --> 19:12.068
It was a good try, Everest.

19:12.235 --> 19:14.547
And look, she left the Throne!

19:14.618 --> 19:15.735
Yeah!

19:15.845 --> 19:17.685
It's getting
a little small here.

19:17.914 --> 19:20.649
Zuma, use your
mini-sub to rescue Jake!

19:20.710 --> 19:23.297
Let's dive in!

19:29.854 --> 19:32.205
Scuba!

19:35.003 --> 19:38.641
Hang in there, Jake!

19:42.044 --> 19:43.450
Oh, thanks!

19:43.575 --> 19:47.325
Kinda like water-skiing
but a whole lot chillier.

19:48.165 --> 19:49.700
Way to go!

19:54.425 --> 19:56.667
Sweetie's going to
grab the Throne back!

19:56.769 --> 19:58.964
And take that
poor penguin with it!

19:59.089 --> 20:02.457
Everest, use your
snowboard to save that bird!

20:02.483 --> 20:05.623
Surf's up!

20:08.195 --> 20:11.568
Hurry, penguin! Come on!

20:13.050 --> 20:14.487
At least that little penguin

20:14.565 --> 20:16.534
won't be taking
a trip with Sweetie!

20:16.667 --> 20:20.807
Yeah, but that no-good pup
is getting away with the Throne!

20:20.962 --> 20:22.073
Not for long.

20:22.173 --> 20:24.245
Is your plane
controller ready, Rocky?

20:24.375 --> 20:26.042
Yup, it's ready!

20:26.174 --> 20:29.253
Marshall, use your hydro
launcher to blast Rocky's gadget

20:29.307 --> 20:30.576
onto the Air Patroller!

20:30.659 --> 20:33.821
Hydro launcher!

20:35.654 --> 20:38.130
Your serve, Marshall!

20:42.960 --> 20:44.162
Nice shot, pups!

20:44.209 --> 20:47.030
Rocky, get control of
our plane and bring it back!

20:47.198 --> 20:49.436
Roger that, Ryder!

20:52.936 --> 20:54.201
It's working!

20:54.351 --> 20:55.694
Captain Busby!

20:55.799 --> 20:57.483
You're flying the wrong way!

20:59.584 --> 21:01.756
The Paw Patrol
must have done something!

21:01.920 --> 21:04.780
Fine!
I'll fly this thing myself.

21:05.124 --> 21:06.905
Whoa!

21:07.098 --> 21:08.795
<i>I'm afraid not, Sweetie.</i>

21:08.912 --> 21:12.225
<i>Mission Paw is controlling
the Air Patroller now!</i>

21:15.342 --> 21:18.389
Okay, okay!
I give up!

21:18.499 --> 21:21.639
Just stop this awful ride!

21:24.561 --> 21:27.421
Think we're ready
to head back to Barkingburg!

21:30.184 --> 21:32.137
Still no sign of the Paw Patrol

21:32.311 --> 21:34.458
or my beautiful Throne.

21:37.844 --> 21:39.420
It's the Air Patroller!

21:39.779 --> 21:41.333
With my Throne!

21:41.731 --> 21:44.504
And here comes
the Mission Cruiser!

21:47.347 --> 21:50.957
Okay, Rocky.
Bring her in for a landing!

21:53.958 --> 21:55.392
Wha... whoa!

21:55.654 --> 21:59.136
Oops, I didn't mean to do that!

22:03.830 --> 22:06.471
Greetings, loyal subjects.

22:06.634 --> 22:08.936
I am Queen...

22:13.204 --> 22:16.385
I really can't stand fish.

22:16.580 --> 22:18.596
My poor soggy Sweetie!

22:18.686 --> 22:20.174
Come here.

22:21.150 --> 22:25.189
Now, that's a Royal
smile, your highness.

22:25.283 --> 22:27.744
Thank you, pups,
for saving the Royal Throne

22:27.900 --> 22:30.963
and giving the princess
a reason to smile again!

22:31.101 --> 22:32.752
No problem, your Earlness.

22:32.916 --> 22:34.713
Whenever you
have a Royal problem,

22:34.827 --> 22:37.057
Just say "Cheese" for help!

22:38.258 --> 22:40.534
Except for my naughty Sweetie!

22:40.635 --> 22:42.807
She says, "I'm sorry!"

22:42.990 --> 22:44.213
Cheese!

22:44.315 --> 22:46.103
I'm sorry!

22:46.267 --> 22:47.713
Sorta.
