-Thought we said 9:00.

02:04.158 --> 02:05.826
DONNY: Yeah.

02:05.859 --> 02:07.761
But new chief showed up early.

02:07.795 --> 02:10.531
Wants to gather the department
together first thing.

02:10.564 --> 02:12.200
So, since the department
is you and me,

02:12.233 --> 02:13.867
I figured
I'd come and get you.

02:13.901 --> 02:15.303
-Ooh, is that coffee?
-Mmm.

02:21.342 --> 02:22.543

02:22.576 --> 02:24.345
Is that the box
you took from Ennis'?

02:24.378 --> 02:25.379
GLORIA: Uh-huh.

02:27.248 --> 02:28.449
Nathan at his dad's?

02:28.482 --> 02:29.517
Hopefully.

02:32.586 --> 02:33.721
Oh.

02:35.423 --> 02:37.525
Do you think
this Thaddeus Mobley fella

02:37.558 --> 02:38.992
had something to
do with the murder?

02:40.027 --> 02:41.562
GLORIA: I should say so,

02:43.197 --> 02:45.032
seeing as how Ennis Stussy

02:45.065 --> 02:47.067
and this Thaddeus Mobley
are one and the same.

02:47.868 --> 02:49.069
Come again?

02:51.772 --> 02:53.541
How's it you're in
my kitchen again?

02:54.542 --> 02:56.577
Oh, the chief...
Well, the new chief.

02:57.211 --> 02:59.547
Oh, right. The department.

03:02.783 --> 03:04.084
Well... (EXHALES)

03:04.752 --> 03:06.720
Let's go see
if I still have a job.

the autopsy later?

03:33.814 --> 03:35.215
They glued
his nose and mouth shut.

03:35.249 --> 03:38.185
Are we thinking cause of death
is somehow a cliffhanger?

03:38.218 --> 03:39.587
Guess not.

03:40.454 --> 03:41.755
Did you canvass the local?

03:41.789 --> 03:44.091
Any reports of
strange customers?

03:44.124 --> 03:45.593
Well, Earl at the Gas N Go

03:45.626 --> 03:47.395
intimated he might
have had a weird one.

03:47.428 --> 03:48.462
Weird how?

-Ron? Can you hear me?

03:57.271 --> 03:59.740
I wanted to check on Nathan,
make sure he was getting...

Ah, I can't quite hear you.

Every time I make a call,

04:09.983 --> 04:11.852
it's like
I'm in a silent movie.

04:57.398 --> 04:58.966
Is that a trick question?

05:10.143 --> 05:11.311
IRV: "Keep it."

05:11.579 --> 05:13.213
SY: That's what he said.

05:13.246 --> 05:16.384
This V.M. Vargas?

05:16.417 --> 05:19.019
Yes. And we should have...

05:19.052 --> 05:20.688
At the time when
we needed the loan,

05:20.721 --> 05:22.490
we should have come to you.

05:23.424 --> 05:26.093
Any idea what the V.M.
stands for?

05:31.198 --> 05:33.701
You borrowed
$1,000,000 from a man

05:33.734 --> 05:34.968
without knowing
his first name.

05:35.002 --> 05:36.770
-I know how it...
-IRV: It's not a question.

05:37.170 --> 05:39.540
I'm just assessing
the level of stupidity.

05:39.573 --> 05:40.641
-Hey, hey.
-Irv, come on,

05:40.674 --> 05:41.975
we don't have to...

05:42.009 --> 05:43.677
You get a lot of
business from us.

05:43.711 --> 05:45.413
Which, boychik,
will stop the moment

05:45.446 --> 05:47.180
they arrest you
for money laundering.

05:47.214 --> 05:48.649
At which time,
all your business

05:48.682 --> 05:50.684
goes to a criminal attorney.

05:50.718 --> 05:52.586
And might I recommend
Bruce Lipshits

05:52.620 --> 05:53.887
in our Minneapolis office?

05:53.921 --> 05:56.790
-We're not asking for...
-Irv, stop screwing around.

05:57.858 --> 06:01.529
I need you to do some digging
on this guy, his outfit.

06:01.562 --> 06:03.096
Now, we gave you his card

06:03.130 --> 06:05.365
and the card
his reps gave to us last year.

06:05.399 --> 06:07.067
You have the loan document,

06:07.100 --> 06:09.102
on which is a phone number
and a mailing address.

06:09.136 --> 06:11.505
There's also
a corporate ID number!

06:11.539 --> 06:13.273
So unless you got
the brains of a monkey,

06:13.306 --> 06:14.608
you should be able to friend

06:14.642 --> 06:16.944
this cocksucker on Facebook,
and reel him in.

06:19.212 --> 06:20.280
And then?

06:21.882 --> 06:25.218
Then we get him to
take his money back

06:25.252 --> 06:26.820
and forget he ever met us.

07:16.504 --> 07:20.007
We talked about this.
It's for his own good.

07:20.508 --> 07:21.675
A man like that,

07:21.709 --> 07:23.310
used to blaming
others for his...

07:23.343 --> 07:25.145
Maybe I should just
give him the stamp.

07:25.178 --> 07:26.947
To what end?

07:28.649 --> 07:30.283
You think that'll fix it?

07:30.317 --> 07:33.120
Next thing he's going
to want is interest.

It's envy, the green monster.

you thought it'd be

a good investment long-term.

13:16.063 --> 13:17.764
Maybe turn it
into condos one day.

13:17.797 --> 13:19.032
Right.

13:19.066 --> 13:20.834
We should talk
to Stan Grossman about that.

Test the waters.

13:22.069 --> 13:24.637
Yeah. I'll make a note.

Well, okay. There's that, too.

13:34.181 --> 13:37.584
But more to the point,
what's in it?

And I'm a little troubled
by the escalation.

this fella has...

I don't even
wanna say it out loud.

don't you think?

14:13.553 --> 14:14.721
Just from the one meeting.

14:17.724 --> 14:20.527
We should probably
drive over there, take a look.

the other way to go, not.

I think we gotta wait
and see what Irv turns up.

14:57.097 --> 14:58.932
Then, whatever dirt, we use

ourselves overall.

Where are the computers?

15:27.160 --> 15:29.796
They're in the boxes.

Well, old chief. Sorry, Chief.

15:33.666 --> 15:34.834
Oh, you don't like them?

to be honest, a mystery.

Eden Valley in 1980.

38:00.879 --> 38:03.982

I was six.

38:04.483 --> 38:06.284

for four years.

38:06.318 --> 38:08.820
So, I mean, honestly,
we're not even family, really,

38:08.854 --> 38:10.088

Nathan should have

38:10.121 --> 38:11.490
the influence of
a male elder in his life,

38:11.523 --> 38:13.725
seeing as how his dad left.

38:16.562 --> 38:19.297

your mother, perhaps.

Ennis may have had, or...

44:50.088 --> 44:51.222
Come on!

44:52.223 --> 44:53.458
Stop!

44:53.859 --> 44:55.193
We have rights.

44:55.226 --> 44:56.527
Emmit. Emmit.

44:56.561 --> 44:59.664
You're making a scene,
all right?

44:59.697 --> 45:01.632
Now,
let's talk in your office.

45:13.044 --> 45:14.612
-What's...
-They just...

45:15.046 --> 45:17.783
I'm sorry, Mr. Feltz,
they just pushed their way in.

45:19.885 --> 45:21.286
Oh, good. They're here.

45:22.453 --> 45:25.456
Uh, nothing to worry about,
Madeline.

45:26.257 --> 45:28.259
Remember how I said
we were expanding

45:28.293 --> 45:29.560
our IT department?

45:29.961 --> 45:31.096
No.

45:31.963 --> 45:33.631
Well, we are. So...

45:36.968 --> 45:38.403
Sorry, I was
dealin' with the...

45:38.436 --> 45:39.470
What?

45:40.806 --> 45:41.873
Your...

45:41.907 --> 45:44.976
VARGAS: Did I tell you
what I like about this place,

45:45.010 --> 45:46.344
Minnesota?

45:47.345 --> 45:53.018
It's so perfectly,
sublimely bland.

45:55.653 --> 45:59.490
Have you been to the Danube?
Or Gansu?

46:00.425 --> 46:02.427
And the African continent...
Forget it.

46:02.460 --> 46:04.495
North and south. Anarchy.

46:04.963 --> 46:08.399
And, yes, you can still find
some relative stability

46:08.433 --> 46:12.804
in the brutal nation states,
North Korea...

46:13.104 --> 46:15.306
Putin's done some great things
with Russia.

46:15.340 --> 46:17.442
You just have to know
which palms to grease.

46:17.475 --> 46:19.811
But one wearies
of the constant

46:19.845 --> 46:22.948
remunerations and
the petty shakedowns...

46:23.648 --> 46:26.484
Meet the new boss,
same as the old boss.

46:26.784 --> 46:28.219
Am I right?

46:28.719 --> 46:30.021
Mr. Vargas?

46:30.055 --> 46:31.356
Please, Sy...

46:32.190 --> 46:34.525
Call me V.M.

46:34.960 --> 46:35.961
Eh?

46:36.527 --> 46:37.762
We're partners now.

46:37.795 --> 46:39.330
We are not partners.

46:39.364 --> 46:40.832
That... This...

46:40.866 --> 46:42.367
-You lent us some...
-Capital.

46:42.633 --> 46:43.768
Which we've told you,

46:43.801 --> 46:45.636
we're happy to pay back
with interest.

46:46.137 --> 46:48.373
(SPEAKING FRENCH)

46:52.477 --> 46:54.545
You see, that's the problem
with you Americans.

46:54.579 --> 46:56.214
You watch too many movies,
and you think

46:56.247 --> 46:58.683
the deal can always
be changed, and it can't.

46:58.716 --> 47:01.186
We're partners now,
and that's all there is to it.

47:01.219 --> 47:02.820
So, you might as
well just lie back,

47:02.854 --> 47:05.823
as they say,
and enjoy yourselves.

47:13.098 --> 47:15.533
Let me tell you what it is
that attracts me

47:15.566 --> 47:17.903
to the parking lot business,
yours in particular.

47:17.936 --> 47:19.270
It's three things.

47:20.071 --> 47:21.606
It runs on cash.

47:22.607 --> 47:24.709
You don't use technology.

47:24.742 --> 47:28.379
And that makes your income
impossible to verify.

47:28.413 --> 47:30.715
'Cause who's to
say how many cars

47:30.748 --> 47:33.851
parked in which spots
and for how long?

47:33.885 --> 47:37.889
Mr. Vargas, V.M., if I may...

47:38.289 --> 47:40.391
We show, in our books...

47:40.425 --> 47:43.761
We show a very consistent,
very steady,

47:43.794 --> 47:45.563
predictable income

47:45.596 --> 47:47.232
from lot to lot,

47:47.265 --> 47:50.068
consistent with
several urban volume factors.

47:51.236 --> 47:53.905
And if you start
goosing those numbers...

47:53.939 --> 47:58.776
Well, (SCOFFS)
so we buy more lots.

47:59.644 --> 48:02.547
Maybe branch out,
start developing

48:02.580 --> 48:06.351
some multi-function commercial
and residential properties,

48:06.384 --> 48:08.253
a new stadium, perhaps.

48:12.290 --> 48:13.458
There.

48:14.459 --> 48:16.594
There you go.
Now you're seeing it.

48:16.627 --> 48:18.964
The inescapable reality.

48:21.166 --> 48:22.767
You're trapped.

48:25.636 --> 48:27.438
Don't look so sad.

48:28.139 --> 48:31.309
By the time we're done,
you'll be billionaires.

48:33.311 --> 48:34.679
On paper, at least.

48:36.447 --> 48:38.783
Good. Well,
that's that out of the way.

48:38.816 --> 48:40.551
Now, you may not see
much of me

48:40.585 --> 48:41.953
for a couple of days,

48:41.987 --> 48:43.955
brutal nation states and all,

48:43.989 --> 48:45.623
but Yuri and Meemo
will be here

48:45.656 --> 48:47.792
to make sure
everything runs smoothly.

48:48.493 --> 48:52.297
And, oh, yes,
condolences on your attorney.

48:54.032 --> 48:57.768
What makes it so tragic
is how avoidable it was.

48:57.802 --> 48:59.204
But you understand,

49:00.038 --> 49:03.341
I can't have people out there
investigating things.

49:05.543 --> 49:08.013
