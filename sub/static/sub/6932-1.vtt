   - Have you guys seen Billy?
             - Nope.

00:38.671 --> 00:41.473
          (beatboxing)

00:44.377 --> 00:46.412
           - Natalie!

00:46.513 --> 00:48.347
      Where you been, girl?
           (laughing)

00:48.448 --> 00:51.383
  - Hey... Have you seen Billy?

00:51.484 --> 00:54.820
          - Uh... No. Come have
               a drink with me!

00:54.921 --> 00:58.257
    - You know I don't drink.
 - It's never too late to start.

00:58.358 --> 01:00.426
           You've got
     college to think about.

01:00.527 --> 01:03.962
- I've got sleep to think about.
- Come on! Summer's almost over.

01:04.063 --> 01:06.932
       I mean, this is our last
        high school party ever!

01:07.033 --> 01:09.468
         (all cheering)

01:22.949 --> 01:25.184
- Oh, my bad...

01:25.285 --> 01:28.420
...Billy?

01:28.521 --> 01:31.757
        - Natalie! Uh...

01:31.858 --> 01:34.326
  Natalie wait, I can explain!
            - Really?

01:34.427 --> 01:37.229
  - Well, no... I'm sorry, OK?
       - No, it's not OK.

01:37.330 --> 01:40.132
    It's the opposite of OK.
 - I didn't mean to, she just...

01:40.233 --> 01:42.734
- What, she assaulted you? Do
you want me to call the cops?

01:42.836 --> 01:44.870
    - Look, it just happened,
           all right?

01:44.971 --> 01:46.872
        - Why did you even want
                 to be with me?

01:46.973 --> 01:50.075
- I've never dated a smart girl
before, only hot ones.

01:50.176 --> 01:54.313
           - Good God!
    - I didn't mean to, I...

01:54.414 --> 01:57.249
         Can you just...

01:57.350 --> 02:01.086
            - Thanks.
    - I always got your back.

02:03.656 --> 02:06.792
     - (Alexa): That's her.

02:06.893 --> 02:08.994
         - Are you sure
      she's the right girl?

02:09.095 --> 02:11.530
              - She is perfect.

02:14.200 --> 02:16.101
        - She is pretty.

02:16.202 --> 02:18.637
         - Ms. Natalie Kellison
         is just the right bait

02:18.738 --> 02:21.073
      to catch our little fish.

02:28.014 --> 02:30.149
    - Oh, I thought you were
         going to call?

02:30.250 --> 02:33.118
 - Sorry, battery died...again.

02:33.219 --> 02:35.721
    - Oh. You need a new phone.

02:35.822 --> 02:37.856
      - I need a new life.

02:37.957 --> 02:43.061
 - You, uh, wanna talk about it?
            (sighing)

02:43.163 --> 02:47.599
         - Hey, Natalie.
        - Didn't realize
      it was a date night.

02:47.700 --> 02:51.303
  - No, no, we were just, uh...
 - I really don't need to know.

02:53.606 --> 02:56.708
                       - Nat...

03:18.331 --> 03:21.667
        (crying quietly)

03:33.646 --> 03:36.315
      - (Nikki): Did Billy
          call you yet?

03:36.416 --> 03:41.353
       - My phone's dead.
      Hopefully, so is he.

03:41.454 --> 03:43.755
        - Dude, that kid
      was training wheels.

03:43.856 --> 03:46.258
     You're going to be getting
     so much action in college.

03:46.359 --> 03:48.393
             Ivy League action.

03:48.494 --> 03:50.796
 - Hey, guys are the last thing
      on my mind right now.

03:50.897 --> 03:53.098
I just want to get
out of this town.

03:53.199 --> 03:55.601
            - I feel.

03:55.702 --> 03:57.736
            So, how's
     the old man taking it,

03:57.837 --> 04:01.073
      you leaving and all?
        - He'll be fine.

04:01.174 --> 04:03.442
    He's got his girlfriend.

04:03.543 --> 04:06.712
   - Jenny seems cool. Why you
     gotta be hating on her
          all the time?

04:06.813 --> 04:10.682
                - I don't know,
                  she's just...

04:10.783 --> 04:14.253
- ...Not your mom?

04:14.354 --> 04:17.089
          - I miss her so much.

04:17.190 --> 04:18.957
- I know.

04:19.058 --> 04:22.261
- She'd be so stoked
to see you right now,

04:22.362 --> 04:25.063
following in her footsteps.

04:25.164 --> 04:27.165
         - Speaking of which...

04:32.005 --> 04:35.774
         Check this out.
   - Dude, I don't read Latin.

04:35.875 --> 04:38.810
       - Dude, it's Greek.
         Delta Psi Beta.

04:38.911 --> 04:42.614
          - A sorority?
         - Only the most
 prestigious one in the country.

04:42.715 --> 04:46.251
 - Why would you wanna hang out
    with a bunch of whack-ass
         prepster girls?

04:46.352 --> 04:48.787
    - My mom was a Delta Psi.

04:48.888 --> 04:51.623
           - Still...
  - I mean, my mom used to say

04:51.724 --> 04:53.625
    that her sorority sisters
       were closer to her

04:53.726 --> 04:55.727

              they use on those
      dating sites. Here, look.

             They are both into

07:53.406 --> 07:55.540

09:01.674 --> 09:03.575
        We can do better.
       - What's wrong with

09:03.676 --> 09:05.577
a fraternity? I mean,
I'm pledging a sorority.

09:05.678 --> 09:07.579

          - Which one?

09:07.680 --> 09:09.581

            - Me too!

09:09.682 --> 09:12.250
            - Really?
   - Why are you so surprised?

09:12.351 --> 09:15.086
     - You just don't strike me
                   as the type.

09:15.187 --> 09:17.222
       - Well, what type?
          - You know...

09:17.323 --> 09:20.592
  Super status-conscious, over-
 privileged rich girl. Like me!

09:22.995 --> 09:25.096
- Same. My sister was Delta Psi.

09:25.197 --> 09:27.098
- My mom.

               roommate surveys
                     after all.

09:31.837 --> 09:34.039
- OK, so what was wrong
with the frat boys?

09:34.140 --> 09:36.474
               - It's all about
              which fraternity.

09:36.576 --> 09:38.877
           Omega Mu is strictly
                business class.

09:38.978 --> 09:41.246

         It's beautiful.

I'm talking
Founding Fathers old.

10:00.566 --> 10:02.567

       Come on! Let's go.

10:06.739 --> 10:09.174
                        - Hi...

10:09.275 --> 10:11.509
        - Hi! I'm Sophia.

10:14.947 --> 10:16.848
      - This dress feels weird.

10:16.949 --> 10:20.151
- It looks stunning on you.
I'm so glad it fit.

10:20.252 --> 10:22.721
 - I think the last time I wore
       one was my confirmation.

10:22.822 --> 10:24.823
        I think I was 12.
       - You're Catholic?

10:24.924 --> 10:27.626
                  - My mom was.

10:27.727 --> 10:29.527
- She's not anymore?

10:29.629 --> 10:31.630
         - She, actually, um...

10:31.731 --> 10:33.732
                ...passed away.

10:33.833 --> 10:36.401
- Oh, my God...
How long ago?

10:36.502 --> 10:39.771
     - I was in tenth grade.

10:39.872 --> 10:43.008
     - Good evening, ladies.
       I'm Leanna, head of
       the rush committee.

10:43.109 --> 10:46.011
         - Sophia Davis.

         My parents have
   a Frank Lloyd Wright home.

11:00.393 --> 11:02.460
  - Oh, wow! That's impressive.

11:02.561 --> 11:04.996
        I mean, I'm more
   of an I.M. Pei gal, but...

11:05.097 --> 11:08.700
       - Well... Have fun.

11:08.801 --> 11:10.669
      - Well, she hates me!

11:10.770 --> 11:13.304
   - (Sophia): Don't be silly.
        You're charming.

11:13.406 --> 11:15.807
  Awkward charming, but still.

11:15.908 --> 11:18.677
                      - Thanks.

11:18.778 --> 11:22.447
       - There's the girl
   we really need to impress.

       sorority president

11:25.017 --> 11:26.918
   Her father's a congressman.

11:27.019 --> 11:28.820
                - Well, I mean,
      should we go talk to her?

11:28.921 --> 11:32.257
   - You never approach Alexa!

11:32.358 --> 11:34.926
     OK? She approaches you.

11:40.499 --> 11:43.802
            - Mm-hmm... Oh, hi.

11:43.903 --> 11:46.604
         - Alexa Cooper.
     - I know. I mean, I...

11:46.706 --> 11:49.207
            Sorry. I'm Natalie.

11:49.308 --> 11:51.209
- Natalie Kellison. Freshman.

11:51.310 --> 11:54.946
School of Architecture.
2200 on your SATs.

11:55.047 --> 11:57.215
            - 2160...
     - Well, I was rounding.

11:57.316 --> 11:59.217
But either way,
rather impressive.

11:59.318 --> 12:02.687
   - I'm good at taking tests.
 - We'll have to see about that.

12:02.788 --> 12:07.058
       - What else do you
         know about me?
          - Everything!

12:07.159 --> 12:10.895
Everything to do with your
application, that is.

12:10.996 --> 12:14.933
I make it a point to review
legacies personally,

12:15.034 --> 12:19.237
and your mother
was a remarkable woman.

12:19.338 --> 12:23.875
Successful architect,
charity fundraiser...

12:23.976 --> 12:27.746
       Big shoes to fill.
        - Yeah, they are.

12:27.847 --> 12:29.848
- Enjoy the rest
of your evening.

12:29.949 --> 12:31.850
                      - Thanks.

12:31.951 --> 12:36.087
       - That was weird...

12:36.188 --> 12:39.424
      - Natalie, you've made it
             to the next round.

12:39.525 --> 12:42.727
      Tomorrow night, midnight.

12:52.238 --> 12:55.006
         - ♪ OK, girls ♪

12:55.107 --> 12:59.744
    ♪ Time to get down to our
      couture bad selves ♪

13:06.852 --> 13:09.954
             - Ouch!
 - Aw, it's perfect! Try it on.

13:10.055 --> 13:12.323
       - I couldn't afford
   to rent a dress like this.

13:12.424 --> 13:14.592
- Don't worry about it.
Today's little

13:14.693 --> 13:18.029
  shopping excursion is on me.
        - No, I couldn't.

13:18.130 --> 13:20.932
    - To be precise, it's on
     my evil ex-stepfather.

13:21.033 --> 13:24.102
     He hurt my mom so bad,
    he's still paying for it.

13:26.572 --> 13:28.573
             - OK...
          - Super cute.

13:31.877 --> 13:34.512
        You look amazing!
             - Yeah?

13:34.613 --> 13:37.348
          - Oh, my God!
     You have to wear that.

13:37.449 --> 13:39.450
          - You think?
             - Yes.

13:48.427 --> 13:50.728
- (Alexa): This sorority
is our family.

13:50.830 --> 13:53.631
That you are
standing here today

13:53.732 --> 13:56.835
means that we see
something in you.

13:56.936 --> 13:59.537
A certain potential.

13:59.638 --> 14:01.840
Few have it,

14:01.941 --> 14:05.143
and even fewer
are able to realize it.

14:07.146 --> 14:10.014
In order to become
one of our sisters,

14:10.115 --> 14:13.017
you will have to prove to us

14:13.118 --> 14:16.654
you have what it takes
to realize that potential.

14:19.158 --> 14:22.760
As you stand here
in the darkness,

14:22.862 --> 14:25.763
look deep into your heart,

14:25.865 --> 14:28.132
into your soul,

14:30.135 --> 14:32.036
and ask yourself:

14:32.137 --> 14:35.874
Do I have what it takes?

15:19.985 --> 15:24.122
  - ♪ I took you to the edge ♪

15:24.223 --> 15:27.125
 ♪ I told you to get undressed ♪

15:27.226 --> 15:30.295

           - Sit down.

16:13.605 --> 16:15.506
            Your time has come.

16:15.607 --> 16:17.742
          Are you ready
     to face your challenge?

16:17.843 --> 16:20.878
             - Uh...

16:20.980 --> 16:24.148
   - Yours is a quest, for you

16:24.249 --> 16:26.517
                 and you alone.

16:26.618 --> 16:29.087
        You may not share
   these details with anyone.

16:29.188 --> 16:32.123
        Not your friends,
        not your family.

16:32.224 --> 16:36.361
    No one. Do you so swear?

16:36.462 --> 16:38.863
        - Uh, yeah, I...

16:38.964 --> 16:41.566
      - You say, "I swear."
           - I swear.

16:41.667 --> 16:45.303
                 - Now, open it
             and read it aloud.

16:48.807 --> 16:52.143
- "I, Natalie Kellison, will..."

16:52.244 --> 16:54.445
           - Read it.

16:56.815 --> 16:59.984
  - "I, Natalie Kellison, will
       seduce a young man

17:00.085 --> 17:02.320
  of the sorority's choosing."

17:05.223 --> 17:07.224
   - I don't think I can do--
           - Silence.

17:07.326 --> 17:11.561
        You do not speak,
    you do not ask questions.

17:11.663 --> 17:14.799
  You have until noon tomorrow
      to accept this quest.

17:14.900 --> 17:18.935
      Do so, and you become
       one of our sisters.

17:19.038 --> 17:21.039
            Don't...

17:21.140 --> 17:24.275
   ...and you'll live forever
          in obscurity.

17:42.694 --> 17:46.464
(Sophia): Come on. Spill.
 - They said not to tell anyone.

17:46.565 --> 17:48.766
      - Mm. Anyone outside
        of the sorority.

17:53.906 --> 17:55.873
         - They want me
       to seduce someone.

17:55.974 --> 17:59.744
         - Oh, that's so
     much better than mine.
 - I don't know if I can do it.

17:59.845 --> 18:03.514
      - Of course you can.
 Who's the guy? Or is it a girl?

18:03.615 --> 18:06.217
    - It's a guy, but I don't
       know who it is yet.

18:06.318 --> 18:08.219
        - Doesn't matter.
     Guys are all the same.

18:08.320 --> 18:12.290
Little smile, little skin, boom!
           You're in.

18:12.391 --> 18:14.992
      - I don't know, it's just
           not really my style.

18:15.094 --> 18:17.095
  Besides, I don't know how far
            they want me to go.

18:17.196 --> 18:20.465
  Nat, hello! This is college.

18:20.566 --> 18:23.034
      You're bound to have
      some random hook-ups,

18:23.135 --> 18:25.136
     this one just gets you
       the golden ticket.

18:29.942 --> 18:32.210
               - Ready for your
               future to begin?

18:34.880 --> 18:38.015
        Sumner Williams.
 Sophomore, varsity track team.

18:38.117 --> 18:41.486
  Here, I'm sending it to you.
         - Ugh... My ex

18:41.587 --> 18:46.157
           was a jock.
 - You don't have to marry him.

18:46.258 --> 18:48.392
 - What exactly do I have to do?

18:48.494 --> 18:51.129
- Get him to notice you, get him
 to go out with you, and then...

18:51.230 --> 18:55.733
        - And then what?
       - Take him back to
  your room and rock his world.

18:55.834 --> 18:58.469
       - So you're saying
    I have to sleep with him?
- We're Delta Psi, not the Bunny

18:58.570 --> 19:00.872
Ranch. You do whatever you want,
  just make sure he's into you.

19:00.973 --> 19:04.509
         - Are we good?
          - We're good.

19:04.610 --> 19:06.711
   - Here's his class schedule.

19:06.812 --> 19:09.180
He'll be getting
out of econ soon.

19:09.281 --> 19:12.150
   Go get him, little sister.

19:19.992 --> 19:23.861
         (phone ringing)

19:23.962 --> 19:27.632
      - Well, look at you,
        all 21st-century!

19:27.733 --> 19:30.268
      <i> - Can you see me OK?</i>
     - Yeah, Dad. What's up?

19:30.369 --> 19:32.403
       - Oh, no, nothing,
   I just had to try this out.

19:32.504 --> 19:34.438
      <i> Pretty cool, right?</i>
          - It's cool.

19:34.540 --> 19:36.941
     <i> - I got Jenny one too,</i>
    <i> but she's not too crazy</i>

19:37.042 --> 19:40.511
 <i> about this whole video thing.</i>
    - Yeah, well, the picture
    isn't always flattering.

19:40.612 --> 19:43.848
   - Nat... You know, someday
     you're going to have to
       give her a chance.

19:45.617 --> 19:47.652
  - Hey, look, Dad, I gotta go.

19:47.753 --> 19:49.654
      <i> - I'll see you soon.</i>
             - Bye.

19:49.755 --> 19:53.057
       - Uh, excuse me...

19:53.158 --> 19:56.527
 - Can you help me? I'm looking
    for the Bregman Building.

19:56.628 --> 19:59.730
        Breg... Bregman,
      that's across campus.

19:59.831 --> 20:02.200
         So you go past
       the admin building,

20:02.301 --> 20:06.637
  you turn left, walk for about
  30, 40 yards, and it'll be...

20:06.738 --> 20:09.640
 - You know, I'm really bad with
  directions, do you think you
         could show me?

20:09.741 --> 20:14.345
      - I've got a class--
      - Please? I'd really
         appreciate it.

20:14.446 --> 20:18.282
    - Yeah... Yeah, I can...
            This way.

20:18.383 --> 20:21.452
            - Thanks.

20:35.000 --> 20:38.569
     - (Natalie): How do you
          like school?

20:38.670 --> 20:40.571
   - (Sumner): It's all right.

20:40.672 --> 20:43.107
      - What's your major?
    - Mechanical engineering.

20:43.208 --> 20:45.676
                      - Really?
           I'm in architecture.

20:45.777 --> 20:48.012
                  Got something
             in common already.

20:48.113 --> 20:52.149
- I'm actually more into the
industrial applications of
things, so...

20:52.251 --> 20:56.053
Anyway, that's Bregman up there,
I've really gotta go. I'm sorry.

20:56.154 --> 20:58.122
                    - Uh, wait.
   I didn't even get your name.

20:58.223 --> 21:00.958
        - Sumner. I'm...
     - Well, thanks, Sumner.

21:01.059 --> 21:04.128
             I'd have been lost
                   without you.

21:04.229 --> 21:06.931
                       But hey,
       can I make it up to you?

21:07.032 --> 21:09.467
            Maybe we can go out
        to coffee or something?

21:09.568 --> 21:12.036
- Uh, sure...

21:12.137 --> 21:15.273
            - Why don't you put
           your number in here?

21:15.374 --> 21:17.375
- OK...

21:22.414 --> 21:26.417
   - Ah, this'll do the trick!
     - That'll turn a trick.

21:26.518 --> 21:28.853
     - Isn't that the idea?

21:28.954 --> 21:31.856
  - Thanks for offering, but I
     think I'll just go with
          my own stuff.

21:31.957 --> 21:35.559
- OK. Um... Well, you have to at
least let me do your makeup.

21:35.661 --> 21:39.030
           - Oh, um...

21:39.131 --> 21:41.232
   - You never go into battle
       without war paint.

21:41.333 --> 21:44.669
- Ugh... I don't know if I can
go through with this.

21:44.770 --> 21:48.739
  - Look, it's not like they're
 gonna be in the room watching,

21:48.840 --> 21:52.743
OK? Just get the guy back here,
     and do as much as you feel
             comfortable doing.

21:52.844 --> 21:54.745
- None of this
feels comfortable.

21:54.846 --> 21:57.882
           - Just have fun, OK?

22:03.655 --> 22:05.690
       - (Sumner): I like
         to hike a lot.

22:05.791 --> 22:08.359
       - No way! I love hiking.

22:10.362 --> 22:12.763
      - You look different.

22:12.864 --> 22:15.199
 - I don't usually wear makeup.

22:15.300 --> 22:18.269
       - Hmm. You should.

22:18.370 --> 22:21.739
         You look good.

22:21.840 --> 22:25.376
  Not that you didn't look good
  before, it's just, what I'm--

22:25.477 --> 22:27.678
           - I get it.

22:27.779 --> 22:30.748
            - Thanks.

22:30.849 --> 22:34.218
        - So, do you have
    any brothers or sisters?

22:34.319 --> 22:37.421
       - No, just me. You?

22:37.522 --> 22:39.457
    - Yeah, sister. Danielle.

22:39.558 --> 22:42.927
      She actually works at
       the school. She's a
       career counsellor.

22:43.028 --> 22:44.929
         - Good person to know.

22:45.030 --> 22:47.031
- I wouldn't be going here
if it weren't for her.

22:47.132 --> 22:51.902
 - I get a big break on tuition.
      - Yeah, must be nice.

22:52.003 --> 22:55.139
              - So she's older?

22:55.240 --> 22:57.141
- She's 12 years older.

22:57.242 --> 23:00.044
     - That's a pretty big gap.
 Why'd your folks wait so long?

23:00.145 --> 23:03.481
- I don't know.

23:03.582 --> 23:06.150
     - You never asked them?

23:06.251 --> 23:10.121
- They, um... They died
when I was pretty young.

23:10.222 --> 23:12.957
It was a car accident.

23:13.058 --> 23:16.193
          - Oh... I'm so sorry.

23:16.294 --> 23:19.864
- Yeah, uh... Danielle
pretty much raised me.

23:25.771 --> 23:28.506
        - So this is you.
 - You don't live in the dorms?

23:28.607 --> 23:31.675
          - No, with my sister.

23:31.777 --> 23:35.513
     - This... This was fun.
    - We should do it again.

23:35.614 --> 23:38.649
              - Yeah, OK. Yeah.

23:41.453 --> 23:44.021
                 ...Good night.

23:44.122 --> 23:47.558
         - Uh... 'Night.

23:50.595 --> 23:53.297
          - Good night.

23:58.570 --> 24:01.105
     - You call that seduction?

24:01.206 --> 24:03.107
- What? It was a first date.

24:03.208 --> 24:05.509
                    - Ugh, God.
           It was like watching

24:05.610 --> 24:08.012
      <i> Lady and the Tramp.</i>
      - You were watching?

24:08.113 --> 24:11.682
- Of course we were watching!
The Delta Psis are fierce.

24:11.783 --> 24:14.452
We get what we want,
and we get it when we want it.

24:14.553 --> 24:16.320
You're going to have
to show us more.

24:16.421 --> 24:19.190
A lot more.

24:19.291 --> 24:21.492
                  - What do you
                 want me to do?

24:21.593 --> 24:24.261
- Whatever you have to do to
make him want you.

24:24.362 --> 24:27.898
Need you.
Lose sleep over you.

24:30.769 --> 24:33.771
You have one more chance
to prove yourself.

24:36.141 --> 24:38.642
                         One.

24:48.186 --> 24:50.788
- So, you actually like the guy?

24:50.889 --> 24:54.225
       - I mean, I didn't
        expect to, but...

24:54.326 --> 24:56.627
        Yeah, I kinda do.

24:56.728 --> 24:58.762
        - Is he into you?

24:58.864 --> 25:02.233
      - I mean, there were
      moments I thought so,

25:02.334 --> 25:04.535
           but then...

25:04.636 --> 25:06.871
          I don't know.
    - Look, you don't exactly

25:06.972 --> 25:09.640
    have the luxury of a long
        courtship, here.

25:09.741 --> 25:13.310
 OK? You need to close the deal.

25:13.411 --> 25:16.080
   - Well, I'm not just going
   to jump into bed with him.

25:16.181 --> 25:20.551
    I mean, even if I could.
   - You can, and you should.

25:20.652 --> 25:25.089
  Or at least some major making
   out. You need to show these
   girls what you're made of.

25:25.190 --> 25:27.157
      - What am I made of?

25:27.259 --> 25:31.228
 - Nat, you're, like, one of the
  coolest chicks I've ever met,

25:31.329 --> 25:33.931
      and I roll with some
       pretty cool peeps.

25:37.802 --> 25:42.139
  - I just can't imagine my mom
    doing anything like this.

25:42.240 --> 25:45.776
    She was so...respectable.

25:48.146 --> 25:50.047
      - She was also young.

25:50.148 --> 25:53.918
          - I guess...
           - You know,

25:54.019 --> 25:56.587
    it'd be a shame if I had
      to join without you.

25:56.688 --> 26:01.191
          - You got in?
      - Delta Psi forever!

26:01.293 --> 26:03.761
        (Sophia laughing)

26:17.809 --> 26:20.377
             - Hey.
        - Hi, little bro.

26:20.478 --> 26:23.647
        - How you doin'?
      - How was your date?

26:23.748 --> 26:26.650
     - Good enough to get me
      another one tonight.

26:26.751 --> 26:29.987
          Look at you!
            - Yeah...

26:30.088 --> 26:31.989
  - I hate to ask again, but--

26:32.090 --> 26:35.292
   - No, no, it's no problem.
          - Thank you.

26:40.165 --> 26:42.099
       Thank you so much.
      I will pay you back.

26:42.200 --> 26:44.635
    - Yeah, I know you will.

26:44.736 --> 26:47.204
            Have fun.
    - I will try to have fun.

26:47.305 --> 26:49.406
        Have a good day.
           - OK, bye!

         - I'm so sorry.

27:40.525 --> 27:43.293
     Sophia gave me her key.
    It's midnight movie night

27:43.395 --> 27:46.296
   at Delta Psi and she was on
      dessert duty. May I?

27:46.398 --> 27:49.900
             - Sure.

27:53.405 --> 27:56.106
          - Brownies...
    - Double chocolate fudge.

27:56.207 --> 27:58.575
         - I love fudge.
         - Who doesn't?

27:58.677 --> 28:02.079
      - Here, have another.
        - Oh, thank you!

28:02.180 --> 28:04.314
         - Oh, I'm good.
           - You sure?

28:04.416 --> 28:06.717
  Chocolate's a total turn-on.

28:08.687 --> 28:11.088
   - Well... You two have fun.

28:24.035 --> 28:26.303
           (muttering)

28:26.404 --> 28:29.139
   - Whoa... Did you see that?
           - See what?

28:29.240 --> 28:32.142
      - Oh, my God, they're
     everywhere. Oh, my God!

28:32.243 --> 28:34.645
             - What?
       - Get off! Get off!

28:34.746 --> 28:36.680
 - What are you... What's wrong?
       - Hey there, stud!

28:36.781 --> 28:38.849
         (all laughing)

28:38.950 --> 28:41.985
    - (sister #1): Sit down.
   - (sister #2): Have a seat.

28:42.087 --> 28:45.989
        (Sumner babbling)
       (distorted voices)

28:52.731 --> 28:55.332
   - What are you guys doing?

28:57.569 --> 28:59.770
     What's happening here?

29:03.775 --> 29:06.577
      - (sister): Where are
      you going, princess?

29:17.689 --> 29:19.590
   - (Leanna): You sexy beast!

29:19.691 --> 29:23.193
    - Stop it! What the hell
       is wrong with you?

29:23.294 --> 29:26.230
        - That is no way
    to talk to your sisters.

29:29.667 --> 29:31.668
             Sumner!

29:33.838 --> 29:35.806
             Sumner!
         (door shutting)

29:35.907 --> 29:39.276
   - His car's still there...

29:39.377 --> 29:42.446
    - (Nat): <i> Leave him alone!</i>
 - (sister): <i> All right, shut up.</i>

29:44.616 --> 29:46.517
         (door opening)
           - Natalie,

29:46.618 --> 29:48.886
      you have to see this.
       - I've seen enough.

29:48.987 --> 29:50.921
           - You have to admit,
             it's pretty funny.

29:51.022 --> 29:52.923
- It's pretty messed up,
is what it is.

29:53.024 --> 29:55.225
  - This'll go viral, for sure.

29:55.326 --> 29:58.228
 - You know what I think I might
     do? Edit a little bit,
        add some music...

29:58.329 --> 30:00.964
- The brownies.

30:01.065 --> 30:03.433
- You put something
in the brownies.

30:03.535 --> 30:06.503
    - She only did what she was
    asked to do. Just like you.

30:06.604 --> 30:08.572
       - If I had known--
       - Forget about him.

30:08.673 --> 30:10.574
       Now that you're with us,

30:10.675 --> 30:14.211
      you have your pick of the
         hottest guy on campus.

30:14.312 --> 30:16.547
               Congratulations,
              Natalie Kellison.

30:16.648 --> 30:18.549
             You are officially

30:18.650 --> 30:21.952
a sister of the Delta Psi Betas.
          (applauding)

30:22.053 --> 30:25.889
      - (sister): Go, girl!

30:49.414 --> 30:52.549
           - I didn't know what
     they had planned, I swear.

30:52.650 --> 30:56.119
       - I thought the brownies
     were just for us to party.

30:56.221 --> 30:58.689
- Some party.

30:58.790 --> 31:02.893
  - Come on, Natalie. Cheer up.
        You're a Delta Psi now.

31:02.994 --> 31:06.930
     Is it the guy? Is that
      what's bothering you?

31:07.031 --> 31:09.433
    - It doesn't bother you?

31:09.534 --> 31:12.469
 - Look, when my sister rushed,

31:12.570 --> 31:15.672
      she had to run naked
    across the football field

31:15.773 --> 31:18.242
        during the game.

31:21.412 --> 31:23.814
    It's all just stupid fun.

31:31.055 --> 31:33.590

         It's Sumner...
        - What about him?

33:05.750 --> 33:07.617
    - There was an accident.
           He's dead.

33:07.719 --> 33:10.787
          - What? How?
  - His car went off the road.

33:10.888 --> 33:12.756
    - He didn't have his car.
   I saw him leave without it.

33:12.857 --> 33:15.258
    - He must have come back.
         - Are you sure?

33:15.360 --> 33:17.427
    - The cops are just here
      talking to the dean.

33:17.528 --> 33:20.097
       He was already dead
      when they found him.

33:20.198 --> 33:24.234
          - Oh, my God!

33:28.439 --> 33:30.707
       - (Alexa): Natalie,
     I'm sorry about Sumner.

33:30.808 --> 33:32.776
      - (Natalie): I still
        can't believe it.

33:32.877 --> 33:37.047
        - It was supposed
     to be a harmless prank.

33:37.148 --> 33:40.784
I never imagined things
could go this wrong.

33:40.885 --> 33:44.454
       - You should have.
- Yeah, you're right. Of course.

33:44.555 --> 33:48.325
Look, I'm sick about it.

33:48.426 --> 33:51.995
    - Why did you even do it?
  - I don't know. It's just...

33:52.096 --> 33:54.765
         It was stupid.

33:56.467 --> 33:58.368
  Look, I hate to have to bring
       this up right now,

33:58.436 --> 34:00.470
     but it's important that
    our stories are straight.

34:00.571 --> 34:02.873
          - "Stories"?

34:02.974 --> 34:06.810
- If anyone asks, we were all at
      the house last night.
       - Why would I lie?

34:06.911 --> 34:10.080
  - As sisters, it's important
   that we protect each other.

34:10.181 --> 34:12.849
      - I didn't even know
    what you guys were doing!

34:12.949 --> 34:15.018
   - But you were the only one
     calling or texting him.

34:15.119 --> 34:18.522
    - Are you threatening me?
           - What? No!

34:18.623 --> 34:20.956
       No, of course not.
      But if this gets out,

34:21.059 --> 34:23.025
       I can't promise you
      that the other girls

34:23.127 --> 34:26.029
   won't blame you to protect
           themselves.

34:26.130 --> 34:29.866
    As far as anyone else is
concerned, this was an accident.

34:29.967 --> 34:31.868
       A tragic accident.

34:31.969 --> 34:34.737
        But if it becomes
    anything more than that,

34:34.839 --> 34:38.475
   we all have a lot to lose.

34:47.418 --> 34:50.454
  - Yeah, that's... That's him.

34:50.554 --> 34:52.755
          My parents...

34:52.857 --> 34:56.126
        My parents, um...

35:32.330 --> 35:35.332
  - (police officer): These are
your brother's personal effects.

35:38.870 --> 35:41.738
          - The, uh...

35:41.839 --> 35:44.474
 The coroner's report indicated
     that he had high levels

35:44.575 --> 35:47.444
         of THC and MDMA
       in his bloodstream.

35:47.545 --> 35:51.281
     - That's weed and ecstasy.

35:51.382 --> 35:54.151
- Do you know where he might
have gotten these drugs?

35:54.252 --> 35:57.921
   - Sumner ran long distance.
     He never touched drugs.

35:58.022 --> 36:00.257
                     - Danny...

36:00.358 --> 36:02.626
       Almost everyone tries it
               once in a while.

36:02.727 --> 36:05.629
          - No, you...
      You don't understand.

36:05.730 --> 36:08.732
        He always played
       everything so safe.

36:08.833 --> 36:10.834
     I was trying to get him
    to come out of his shell.

36:10.935 --> 36:14.171
     - Well... Maybe he did.

36:16.174 --> 36:20.944
      - No. Not like that.
            - Look...

36:21.045 --> 36:22.946
     Drugs are a big problem
           on campus,

36:23.047 --> 36:25.549
          even with all
      the ivy on the walls.

36:27.585 --> 36:30.420
      If you hear anything,
     please give me a call.

36:30.521 --> 36:32.556
       - Yeah, we will. Thanks.

36:32.657 --> 36:35.725
- I'm sorry for your loss.

36:44.802 --> 36:47.304
   - (Alexa): There are times
          in a sorority

36:47.405 --> 36:49.906
    where you're called upon
       to make sacrifices.

36:50.007 --> 36:52.309
       I'm afraid this is
       one of those times.

36:52.410 --> 36:54.311
  - What do you want me to do?

36:54.412 --> 36:56.313
       - I'm sorry, Maddy,

36:56.414 --> 36:58.481
but I'm going to have to ask you
    to move out of the house.

36:58.583 --> 37:00.817
   - You've gotta be kidding.
             Why me?

37:00.918 --> 37:04.487
       - Well, ours is not
         to reason why.

37:04.589 --> 37:08.458
 Caitlin will be joining you as
      well. I found a great
       2-bedroom apartment

37:08.559 --> 37:11.161
  right outside of campus. The
 truck will be here in one hour.

37:11.262 --> 37:13.797
      - This is ridiculous!
         I'm not moving!
          - Excuse me?

37:13.898 --> 37:16.866
    - I've done a lot for the
      sorority. I've earned
          living here.

37:16.968 --> 37:20.470
          - We've done
       a lot for you, too.

37:20.571 --> 37:22.672
  Or did you forget about that
     little sex tape that we

37:22.773 --> 37:26.710
   managed to squash before it
   circulated all over campus?

37:26.811 --> 37:31.047
   - I mean... It'd be a shame
        if it resurfaced.

37:31.148 --> 37:33.817
         - You wouldn't.
            - Please.

37:33.918 --> 37:37.487
  There's nothing I wouldn't do
       for the Delta Psis.

37:37.588 --> 37:40.257
       Absolutely nothing.

37:42.293 --> 37:45.829
               - There you are!
         I've been calling you.

37:45.930 --> 37:48.265
- I'm not feeling very social.

37:48.366 --> 37:50.934
             - Alexa texted us,
           she's got good news.

37:51.035 --> 37:54.271
          Come on! Get dressed.

37:54.372 --> 37:57.474
             - Hey!

38:02.647 --> 38:05.615
         - Hello, hello!
             - Hey!

38:09.287 --> 38:12.856
 - So, I know we didn't get off
       to the best start,

38:12.957 --> 38:16.293
 but a couple of the rooms have
     just become available,

38:16.394 --> 38:19.629
    and I nominated you both
          to get them.

38:21.966 --> 38:24.167
- I thought you had to be at
least a junior to get in here.

38:24.268 --> 38:26.736
- Seniors, mostly, and even then
     there's a waiting list.

38:26.837 --> 38:29.406
          - So why us?

38:29.507 --> 38:32.108
     - Well, I figured that

38:32.209 --> 38:35.445
         it must be hard
      living in the dorms,

38:35.546 --> 38:37.180
               after everything
               that's happened.

38:37.281 --> 38:39.182
            You both have shown
               such great poise

38:39.283 --> 38:42.619
        in dealing with it all.

38:42.720 --> 38:45.955
    - The vote was unanimous.
     You can move in today!

38:46.057 --> 38:49.059
   - But we had to sign a lease
                  at the dorms.

38:49.160 --> 38:51.461
        - Oh, I spoke to
      the Dean of Housing.

38:51.562 --> 38:54.331
     The Delta Psis do have
     some pull around here.

38:56.901 --> 39:00.036
  - Oh, that can go in my room.
             - Yes.

39:07.211 --> 39:09.746
- (Alexa): See? Told you.

39:09.847 --> 39:12.082
Everything's
under control.

39:12.183 --> 39:14.651
         - Guess you got
    a little more than even.

39:14.752 --> 39:18.655
- Yeah, I feel bad
for Sumner, but...

39:18.756 --> 39:22.425
That bitch
got what she deserved.

39:32.403 --> 39:33.970
- (Aiden): You should
take some time off work.

39:35.973 --> 39:38.274
         - I need to keep busy.

39:40.644 --> 39:43.446
- Is there anything I can...

39:43.547 --> 39:46.750
...do for you?

39:46.851 --> 39:49.185
You know, the funeral...

39:49.286 --> 39:51.855
              - No.

39:51.956 --> 39:54.958
         I'll handle it.

39:55.059 --> 39:57.660
  I just want something small.

40:00.965 --> 40:03.566
- I just wish there was
something I could do to help.

40:05.636 --> 40:08.938
       - You already have.

40:11.442 --> 40:13.343
             - Feels like home,
                    doesn't it?

40:13.444 --> 40:15.345
        - It's beautiful.
            - I know.

40:15.446 --> 40:18.782
    - I trust you're finding
   everything to your liking?

40:18.883 --> 40:22.152
        - It's beautiful.
         - Yeah, it is.

40:22.253 --> 40:24.854
     - Well, you guys should
      start getting ready.

40:24.955 --> 40:27.257
           - For what?
            - Hello!

40:27.358 --> 40:29.259
         Only the biggest party
                   of the year!

40:29.360 --> 40:31.261
 We co-host with the Alpha Rhos.

40:31.362 --> 40:34.597
 - No way! They have, like, some
 of the hottest guys on campus.

40:34.698 --> 40:37.734
      - Oh, they do indeed.
       - I think I'm just
         gonna lay low.

40:37.835 --> 40:39.869
                - Getting out's
         gonna be good for you.

40:39.970 --> 40:43.373
   I have a car coming here at
8:00. You guys can ride with me.

40:43.474 --> 40:46.843
     Get to know each other
        a little better.

41:03.727 --> 41:07.330
         Let's go, Nat!
        It's party time!

41:09.733 --> 41:12.735
   (loud dance music playing)

41:32.656 --> 41:36.926
         - That girl...
             - What?

41:37.027 --> 41:40.964
- I don't know
why I didn't think.

41:41.065 --> 41:42.932
Sumner was out with
that girl that night.

41:43.033 --> 41:45.201
Natalie. Here she is.

42:02.520 --> 42:04.420
       - So you think it's her?

42:04.522 --> 42:07.257
- I'm sure as hell
gonna find out.

42:07.358 --> 42:09.626
       - Mm-hmm. Danny...

42:09.727 --> 42:12.161
  Why don't you call the police
        and let them handle it?

42:12.263 --> 42:15.298
- You saw how the police reacted
after I told them about Sumner.

42:15.399 --> 42:18.401
            - Mm-hmm.
         - To them, he's
     just another statistic.

43:18.395 --> 43:21.564
-<i> Hi, this is Danielle Williams,</i>
        <i> Sumner's sister.</i>

43:21.665 --> 43:25.201
        <i> Could you please</i>
         <i> call me back?</i>

43:47.891 --> 43:49.592
            - I'm sorry, Danny.

43:49.693 --> 43:53.162
  - He's with Mom and Dad now.

44:04.341 --> 44:06.876
       - Hey, party girl!
         How's it going?

44:06.977 --> 44:10.279
         - Pretty rough.

44:10.381 --> 44:12.815
- You know you shouldn't
have gone.

44:12.916 --> 44:17.387
               - No-one saw me.
  How did you know I was there?

44:17.488 --> 44:20.556
- Sophia told me.
She's worried about you.

44:20.658 --> 44:23.960
We all are.

44:24.061 --> 44:26.262
               - She called me.

44:26.363 --> 44:29.098
        - Who called you?
       - Sumner's sister.

44:29.199 --> 44:32.735
     - Did you speak to her?
    - No, I didn't, I can't--

44:32.836 --> 44:35.238
 - No, you have to, or else it's
    going to look suspicious.

44:35.339 --> 44:38.107
           - What am I
      supposed to tell her?
    - As little as possible.

44:38.208 --> 44:40.076
  Say that you were helping him
 with his homework or something.

44:40.177 --> 44:43.379
        - We didn't have
      any classes together.

44:43.480 --> 44:45.982
        - Look, you'll...
   You'll think of something.

44:46.083 --> 44:49.786
 The most important thing right
     now is that if she asks

44:49.887 --> 44:53.256
  about the night that he died,
 we stick to the same story, OK?

44:53.357 --> 44:55.391
- And if she doesn't believe me?
       - It doesn't matter

44:55.492 --> 44:59.328
what she believes.
I mean, we have a house
full of sisters to back us up.

44:59.430 --> 45:02.165
               - Don't you feel
                 guilty at all?

45:02.266 --> 45:05.168
        - Of course I do.

45:05.269 --> 45:08.638
        Look, if I could
     take it back, I would.

45:08.739 --> 45:10.640
But I can't.

45:10.741 --> 45:13.276
None of us can.

45:15.913 --> 45:18.748
      - The best thing that
 we can do right now is move on.

45:39.002 --> 45:41.237
         (phone ringing)

45:41.338 --> 45:43.473
      - Hello? Who is this?

45:43.574 --> 45:46.876
   - Hi, uh, this is Natalie.
         You called me?

45:46.977 --> 45:49.345
   <i> - Uh, yeah, thank you for</i>
     <i> calling me back, um...</i>

45:49.446 --> 45:51.380
  How well did you know Sumner?

45:51.482 --> 45:54.383
         - ...Not very.

45:54.485 --> 45:57.386
         I mean, we met
     at the bookstore once,

45:57.488 --> 46:00.456
     he asked for my number,
    that was pretty much it.

46:00.557 --> 46:03.392
  - But you went out with him?

46:03.494 --> 46:05.528
       - Uh, no, I didn't.

46:05.629 --> 46:08.131
      - But he said he was
    starting to see someone,

46:08.232 --> 46:10.833
 and there are a bunch of calls
  between you two on his phone.

46:10.934 --> 46:13.202
      - Yeah, he called me
          a few times.

46:13.303 --> 46:15.738
 im II asn't interested.

46:15.839 --> 46:18.407
     - Why did you give him
          your number?

46:18.509 --> 46:22.111
   - I didn't want to be rude.

46:22.212 --> 46:25.414
      - So you have no idea
 where he was the night he died?

46:25.516 --> 46:30.453
          - I'm sorry,
      I wish I could help.

47:59.843 --> 48:01.944
           - Natalie!

48:02.045 --> 48:05.414
     I'm Danielle Williams.
   I was hoping that we could

48:05.515 --> 48:08.818
    finish our conversation.
   - Uh, how did you find me?

48:08.919 --> 48:13.022
         - I work here.
- I already told you everything.

48:13.123 --> 48:16.893
      - How about a coffee?
              - OK.

48:19.796 --> 48:22.164
  - You were seeing my brother.

48:22.266 --> 48:25.368
          - No. I mean,
      I already told you--

48:25.469 --> 48:27.904
         - But you guys
       talked that night.

48:28.005 --> 48:31.641
     He used his credit card
     for dinner. Over $100.

48:31.742 --> 48:36.212
You think if I show your picture
 around the restaurant, someone
       might remember you?

48:39.783 --> 48:41.684
      - OK, we had dinner.

48:41.785 --> 48:44.720
       - Why did you lie?

48:44.821 --> 48:46.722
         - I don't know.

48:46.823 --> 48:49.692
 I didn't want to get involved.
     We only went out twice.

48:49.793 --> 48:54.263
  What did you do after dinner?
   - Nothing, I mean, he just
         dropped me off.

48:54.364 --> 48:56.732
          - What time?

48:56.833 --> 49:00.636
      - Maybe 8:00, 8:30...
            - Really?

49:00.737 --> 49:03.506
    That's early for a date.

49:03.607 --> 49:06.976
          - I had class
      in the morning, so...

49:07.077 --> 49:10.413
    - It wasn't that long ago
     I was a freshman here.

49:10.514 --> 49:12.882
        I know the scene.

49:12.983 --> 49:15.384
     Parties. Party favours.

49:15.485 --> 49:19.188
- What are you
trying to say?

49:19.289 --> 49:23.292
  - Maybe you and Sumner wanted
    to heighten the experience?

49:23.393 --> 49:26.896
A little weed, little ecstasy...
         - No, I don't do drugs.

49:26.997 --> 49:28.898
   - Well, neither did Sumner.

49:28.999 --> 49:32.401
       Somehow he managed
         to do a bunch.

49:32.502 --> 49:35.938
    Enough to get him killed.
      - Well, he didn't do
      anything that I saw.

49:38.208 --> 49:40.209
   What did you do after that?

49:42.879 --> 49:45.348
- Just hung out at the sorority.
        - Which sorority?

49:45.449 --> 49:47.350
        - Delta Psi Beta.

49:47.451 --> 49:51.921
    - Oh, you're a Delta Psi?
 - Listen, I really have to go.

49:52.022 --> 49:54.056
       - Was Alexa there?
            - Sorry?

49:54.157 --> 49:57.059
         - Alexa Cooper.
      She's the president.

49:57.160 --> 50:00.496
   - I really have to go. I'm
really sorry about your brother.

50:06.837 --> 50:09.005
  Well, I did what you told me.
             I lied.

50:09.106 --> 50:11.607
- Good. I knew you
had it in you.

50:11.708 --> 50:13.609
    - Then she tracked me down!

50:13.710 --> 50:15.611
                    I mean, she
          caught me off guard--

50:15.712 --> 50:19.281
  - OK, calm down. What did you
      say to her, exactly?

50:19.383 --> 50:23.252
  - Nothing. I mean, I told her
  Sumner and I had dinner once,

50:23.353 --> 50:25.254
        but that I spent
   the rest of the night here.

50:25.355 --> 50:29.258
   - Good. Good, then we have
     nothing to worry about.

50:29.359 --> 50:32.728
       - Well, I'm pretty
   sure she didn't believe me.
- I told you, it doesn't matter.

50:32.829 --> 50:35.631
     - She asked about you.
           - She did?

50:35.732 --> 50:37.933
            - When I brought up
                     Delta Psi.

50:38.035 --> 50:40.403
     - That's sweet of her.

50:40.504 --> 50:44.640
   - You two know each other?
     - We've crossed paths.

50:44.741 --> 50:49.111
   - Wait, is she the reason--
       - Forget about her.
       This is about you.

50:49.212 --> 50:54.483
              Here.
         - What is this?

50:54.584 --> 50:57.486
- Greta Cummings.
The architect.

50:57.587 --> 51:01.190
  You have heard of her, right?
    - Yeah, of course, she's
          cutting-edge.

51:01.291 --> 51:03.292
   - Well, she's also an alum,

51:03.393 --> 51:06.729
 and there's a summer internship
     coming up at her firm,

51:06.830 --> 51:08.831
and she wants to see you for it.

51:08.932 --> 51:11.467
              - Me?
             - Yeah.

51:11.568 --> 51:15.738
   This is how it works, girl.
     You are one of us, now.

51:15.839 --> 51:18.174
        And a membership,

51:18.275 --> 51:20.776
        it does come with
         its privileges.

51:20.877 --> 51:23.679
     - (Danielle): She knows
         what happened.

51:23.780 --> 51:26.315
        I know she does.

51:26.416 --> 51:28.417
        - You're on shaky
      ground, here, Danny.

51:28.518 --> 51:31.187
    Using university records,
   interrogating a student...

51:31.288 --> 51:33.289
   - Do you think I care about
        my job right now?

51:33.390 --> 51:37.793
      - I think you should.
      - This has something
    to dwith Alexa Cooper.

51:37.894 --> 51:40.963
  - Wanna bring me up to speed?

51:41.064 --> 51:43.132
         - Alexa Cooper,
it's Harrison Cooper's daughter.

51:43.233 --> 51:45.167
    - What, the congressman?

51:45.268 --> 51:48.137
       - Yeah, that's him!
   She is daddy's little girl

51:48.238 --> 51:52.575
     in all the worst ways.
       - You really don't
         like this girl.

51:52.676 --> 51:56.112
 - I make it a point not to get
   personal with my students,
         but this one...

51:56.213 --> 51:58.347
 She was up for a big internship
          last summer,

51:58.448 --> 52:01.984
       and it was between
    her and another girl and
  I recommended the other girl,

52:02.085 --> 52:04.120
    who was better qualified,
           by the way.

52:04.221 --> 52:06.155
    And they listened to me.

52:06.256 --> 52:08.657
         - Let me guess,
      Daddy didn't approve?

52:08.758 --> 52:11.494
  - No, no, I didn't hear from
   him, but I heard from her.

52:11.595 --> 52:13.929
    She called me every name
         under the sun,

52:14.030 --> 52:16.699
      threatened to sue me,
   get me fired, you name it.

52:16.800 --> 52:18.801
   - So you think she drugged
      Sumner to get to you?

52:18.902 --> 52:23.272
  - I wouldn't put it past her.

52:29.713 --> 52:32.882
        - Greta Cummings.
       - Natalie Kellison.

52:32.983 --> 52:35.985
    - Is that your portfolio?
             - Yeah.

52:39.656 --> 52:41.557
     - I really love your work.

52:41.658 --> 52:43.893
I mean, the way you find beauty
      in asymmetrical design...

52:43.994 --> 52:47.229
- You've done your research.
That's good.

52:47.330 --> 52:49.231
Delta Psi sees potential in you.

52:49.332 --> 52:51.367
So do I.

52:51.468 --> 52:55.171
         - Wow, thanks.
         - Yes, well...

52:55.272 --> 52:57.306
How badly do you want
to be an architect?

52:57.407 --> 53:00.276
               - Very. It's all
              I've ever wanted.

53:00.377 --> 53:02.545
- Well, if that's true,
there may be

53:02.646 --> 53:05.414
      a place for you here.
       - Are you serious?

53:05.515 --> 53:08.851
- Work harder than everyone
else, be fearless in your design

53:08.952 --> 53:10.853
and come see me
in the spring.

53:10.954 --> 53:14.523
           - I will, thank you.

53:20.297 --> 53:22.298
            - Alexa.
         - Ms. Williams!

53:22.399 --> 53:24.967
      - Can I speak to you?
          - Of course.

53:25.068 --> 53:27.736
   I'll catch you guys later.

53:30.740 --> 53:33.542
    - Small world, isn't it?
            - How so?

53:33.643 --> 53:35.911
  - One of your new pledges was
           out with my brother,

53:36.012 --> 53:39.381
     the night that he died.
           - Was she?

53:42.719 --> 53:44.687
       - You're too smart
          to play dumb.

53:44.788 --> 53:47.723
             - Not smart enough
       for you to recommend me.

53:50.126 --> 53:52.361
          - It was you.

53:54.331 --> 53:58.701
   - My father pulled a lot of
     strings to get me that
          opportunity,

53:58.802 --> 54:01.303
     and you just cut them.

54:01.404 --> 54:03.706
     - Gutless little bitch!
          - Excuse me?

54:03.807 --> 54:06.709
        - You killed him!
      - I'm sorry, I don't
 know what you're talking about.

54:06.810 --> 54:09.845
 - You disappointed your daddy,
   and you killed my brother.

54:09.946 --> 54:11.847
- I'm sorry
for your loss,

54:11.948 --> 54:14.316
but you are way
out of line here.

54:14.417 --> 54:17.653
               - How can you...
                You killed him.

54:17.754 --> 54:20.122
You need help.

54:44.948 --> 54:47.082
      - ♪ I'm going down ♪

54:52.322 --> 54:55.958
     ♪ Can't see the light ♪

54:56.059 --> 55:00.462
   ♪ There's no turning back ♪

55:03.099 --> 55:06.435
     ♪ I'm losing my mind ♪

55:07.937 --> 55:09.938
                   - Thank you.

55:17.113 --> 55:20.082
         - Doctor Niroc.
      You wanted to see me.

55:20.183 --> 55:22.851
         - Have a seat.
              - OK.

55:25.488 --> 55:28.791
  - First, allow me to offer my
      sincerest condolences

55:28.892 --> 55:32.995
  for the loss of your brother.
       - Oh... Thank you.

55:33.096 --> 55:36.098
I got the flowers that you sent.
      They were beautiful.

55:36.199 --> 55:38.534
      - You've been with us
      almost 10 years now.

55:38.635 --> 55:41.470
           - Yes, sir.
    - I trust you understand

55:41.571 --> 55:45.207
 the various fiduciary duties we
      have as a university.

55:45.308 --> 55:47.343
          - Of course.
      - Someery wealthy,

55:47.444 --> 55:51.213
     very influential people
       have entrusted us,

55:51.314 --> 55:53.349
    not only with the higher
  education of their children,

55:53.450 --> 55:55.584
         but often with
     substantial endowments.

55:58.355 --> 56:00.122
- This is about Alexa, isn't it?

56:00.223 --> 56:04.259
- I can only imagine how
difficult this must be for you,

56:04.361 --> 56:06.795
        but we can't have
      a member of our staff

56:06.896 --> 56:11.700
  accosting students on campus.
     - She's responsible for
       my brother's death.

56:11.801 --> 56:14.436
 - And we certainly cannot make
    unsupported allegations.

56:14.537 --> 56:16.705
           - I get it.

56:16.806 --> 56:19.108
          Money talks.

56:19.209 --> 56:22.378
 - This isn't a matter of money.
It's a matter of proper conduct.

56:22.479 --> 56:25.247
   As one of the most esteemed
     schools in the country,

56:25.348 --> 56:28.150
     we must hold ourselves
  to the highest of standards.

56:35.392 --> 56:39.061
           (footsteps)

56:39.162 --> 56:41.397
       (knocking on door)
           - Come in.

56:41.498 --> 56:44.633
        - Hey, what's up?
         - Natalie left.

56:44.734 --> 56:47.636
  - What do you mean, she left?
    - Someone saw her leaving
            earlier.

56:47.737 --> 56:51.640
      She had a bag packed.

57:07.190 --> 57:10.359
       - Dad? I didn't see
      your truck out there.

57:10.460 --> 57:12.594
           - Natalie.
        - Where's my dad?

57:12.695 --> 57:15.431
       - There was an emergency
       at one of his buildings.

57:15.532 --> 57:17.466
                  We were right
    in the middle of <i> Chinatown.</i>

57:17.567 --> 57:19.501
- I'm going to go
grab some food.

57:19.602 --> 57:22.671
 - We made lasagna, let me heat
        some up for you.

57:25.074 --> 57:28.477
Your father does nothing but
rave about you, you know.

57:28.578 --> 57:30.979
He couldn't be more proud.

57:31.080 --> 57:32.981
        - He exaggerates.

57:33.082 --> 57:36.084
- I doubt that.

57:36.186 --> 57:39.988
I know we haven't talked much,

57:40.089 --> 57:42.658
but I want you to know that

57:42.759 --> 57:45.194
I care about your father
very much.

57:45.295 --> 57:49.498
He's the...kindest, sweetest,

57:49.599 --> 57:52.835
most honest man I've ever met.

57:52.936 --> 57:57.539
The way he talks about you, your
passion, your integrity...

57:57.640 --> 58:01.176
I would never do anything

58:01.277 --> 58:03.178
to hurt him, or you.

58:03.279 --> 58:05.581
Never.

58:11.888 --> 58:13.789
- I'm gonna go...

58:13.890 --> 58:17.493
- No... I mean,
you don't have to.

58:17.594 --> 58:19.995
He'd want you to stay.

58:25.468 --> 58:27.669
          (TV playing)

58:35.545 --> 58:37.646
              Dad?

58:37.747 --> 58:39.915
             - Hey.

58:40.016 --> 58:42.518
    - Got any hot chocolate?

58:42.619 --> 58:44.553
        - Yeah, come on.

58:44.654 --> 58:47.256
  So I take it you two talked.

58:47.357 --> 58:49.925
             - Yeah.

58:50.026 --> 58:51.927
    She's all right, I guess.

58:52.028 --> 58:56.131
     - I know, I'm just glad
        you think so too.

58:58.968 --> 59:02.037
 - I'm happy to see you and all,
  but what are you doing here?

59:02.138 --> 59:04.840
- I just needed
to clear my head.

59:04.941 --> 59:08.277
There's this boy I met...

59:08.378 --> 59:11.179
  - Uh-oh. Boy trouble already?

59:14.050 --> 59:17.853
- He... died.

59:17.954 --> 59:20.222
        - What happened?

59:20.323 --> 59:23.892
- There was an accident.
A car accident.

59:23.993 --> 59:26.161
   - Wait, I think I read about
             this in the paper.

59:26.262 --> 59:28.931
     Kid ran varsity track.
          You knew him?

59:29.032 --> 59:32.067
   - Not very well, but yeah.

59:32.168 --> 59:35.571
     - Said there were drugs
            involved.

59:35.672 --> 59:38.240
     - That's what I heard.

59:38.341 --> 59:41.043
- I'm afraid you're going to see
    a lot of that in college.

59:41.144 --> 59:44.079
       - Yeah, I saw a lot
     of that in high school.

59:47.283 --> 59:49.184
    - How long can you stay?

59:49.285 --> 59:51.753
  - Just 'til tomorrow, I have
     class in the afternoon.

59:51.854 --> 59:54.323
        - I'll drive you.

59:54.424 --> 59:57.025
         - Thanks, Dad.

01:00:03.399 --> 01:00:07.269
  So...that's the whole story.

01:00:07.370 --> 01:00:09.638
     - (Nikki): Ok, well...

01:00:09.739 --> 01:00:12.407
Like, say you do the right thing
       and tell the truth.

01:00:14.410 --> 01:00:17.679
          What's the worst case
                      scenario?

01:00:17.780 --> 01:00:20.682
- Some of the girls blame me.

01:00:20.783 --> 01:00:24.720
I get expelled,
maybe even go to jail.

01:00:26.723 --> 01:00:28.790
- Well, if you weren't involved,

01:00:28.891 --> 01:00:31.226
       then there's no evidence
          that you were, right?

01:00:31.327 --> 01:00:33.595
- We were out that night.
I mean, he called me.

01:00:33.696 --> 01:00:36.264
And I already lied
about knowing him.

01:00:36.366 --> 01:00:38.700
  - Well, you can't be the only
         one with a conscience.

01:00:38.801 --> 01:00:40.769
 Like, can't you get one of the
       other girls to back you?

01:00:40.870 --> 01:00:43.238
- No. I mean, they're all
either too loyal

01:00:43.339 --> 01:00:45.907
or too scared.

01:00:46.009 --> 01:00:47.976
I never should have gone along
with the whole thing.

01:00:48.077 --> 01:00:51.380
     - And you never should have
pledged to that stupid sorority.

01:00:51.481 --> 01:00:55.450
     But you're not responsible
          for this kid's death.

01:00:57.453 --> 01:01:00.288
- It's just all the stories my
mom used to tell me

01:01:00.390 --> 01:01:03.291
about Delta Psi, and how they
supported each other

01:01:03.393 --> 01:01:05.827
and helped each other...

01:01:05.928 --> 01:01:09.031
These bitches have
twisted it all around.

01:01:11.100 --> 01:01:13.402
                        - So...

01:01:13.503 --> 01:01:16.238
      What do we do about this?

01:01:21.644 --> 01:01:25.881
- Well,<i> déjà vu.</i>

01:01:25.982 --> 01:01:29.084
        - I know, right?

01:01:31.821 --> 01:01:34.656
- Nat, I get the feeling there's
something you're not telling me.

01:01:34.757 --> 01:01:38.560
       - It's complicated.

01:01:38.661 --> 01:01:41.630
      - Anything I can do?

01:01:41.731 --> 01:01:44.900
              - No.
 - Is there anything you can do?

01:01:45.001 --> 01:01:48.103
        - That's where it
        gets complicated.

01:01:50.106 --> 01:01:53.508
     - Well, when things get
       complicated, I like
        to simplify them.

01:01:53.609 --> 01:01:57.079
   - I wish it were that easy.

01:01:57.180 --> 01:01:59.881
   - I didn't say it was easy.

01:01:59.982 --> 01:02:02.584
 You know, doing the right thing
         rarely ever is.

01:02:02.685 --> 01:02:05.921
 - How did you know it was about
     doing the right thing?

01:02:06.022 --> 01:02:10.092
 - 'Cause I know you, and I know
     that look on your face.

01:02:10.193 --> 01:02:13.361
       Just like your mom
          used to get.

01:02:13.463 --> 01:02:17.666
      Look, just know that
        whatever you do,

01:02:17.767 --> 01:02:19.701
     I'll be there for you.

01:02:19.802 --> 01:02:23.538
         - Thanks, Dad.

01:02:31.114 --> 01:02:33.682
      (cell phone ringing)
            - Hello?

01:02:33.783 --> 01:02:35.784
         - Can we talk?

01:02:38.454 --> 01:02:41.556
             - Sure.

01:02:41.657 --> 01:02:43.959
- Then I guess he must have gone
back to his car,

01:02:44.060 --> 01:02:47.129
and by then, I mean,
there was nothing I could do.

01:02:47.230 --> 01:02:50.065
    -And you really didn't know
          what Alexa was up to?

01:02:50.166 --> 01:02:52.067
- I never would have been a part

01:02:52.168 --> 01:02:54.102
of something like
that on purpose,

01:02:54.203 --> 01:02:58.073
even if I hated the guy - and I
liked Sumner, I really did.

01:02:58.174 --> 01:03:00.408
- And you're going to tell this
             all to the police?

01:03:00.510 --> 01:03:04.846
- I will, but I think
it might be better if I can
find someone else to back me up.

01:03:04.947 --> 01:03:10.485
 - Those girls will never do it.
    - There's one that might.
      (cell phone ringing)

01:03:10.586 --> 01:03:15.457
   - (Leanna): <i> They're meeting</i>
   <i> again. Doesn't look good.</i>
            - I see.

01:03:15.558 --> 01:03:17.959
    Yeah, we're going to have
     to put an end to this.

01:03:18.060 --> 01:03:20.529
- Should we prepare the package?

01:03:20.630 --> 01:03:22.531
    - Yeah, I'll let you know
       when they're ready.

01:03:22.632 --> 01:03:25.433
       (Leanna hanging up)

01:03:28.404 --> 01:03:30.405
  - You can't go to the police.

01:03:30.506 --> 01:03:33.608
    - I have to. We have to!
            - No way.

01:03:33.709 --> 01:03:36.812
 - You said yourself, you didn't
   know what they had planned.
       - No one's going to

01:03:36.913 --> 01:03:39.748
believe me. Or you. OK?
These bitches mean business.

01:03:39.849 --> 01:03:43.451
           - So do I.
            - Look...

01:03:43.553 --> 01:03:46.521
When I was making the brownies,
Alexa had her camera.

01:03:46.622 --> 01:03:49.324
She'll make it look like you and
I set up Sumner together.

01:03:49.425 --> 01:03:52.227
         - Unbelievable.
      - It's what she does.

01:03:52.328 --> 01:03:56.331
Gets dirt on people and then
uses it as leverage to get
whatever she wants.

01:03:56.432 --> 01:04:00.202
       - Well, I'm sorry,
     but I have to do this.

01:04:02.605 --> 01:04:04.606
- I really thought
we were friends.

01:04:39.475 --> 01:04:43.445
- Orange jacket, burgundy bag.
That's her.

01:04:49.652 --> 01:04:52.087
       - Natalie Kellison?
             - Yes?

01:04:52.188 --> 01:04:54.623
    - We need to search you.
      - Search me for what?

01:04:54.724 --> 01:04:56.758
    - Hand over the bag, please.

01:04:56.859 --> 01:04:59.527
 Raise your arms for me, please.

01:04:59.629 --> 01:05:02.297
       - What's going on?

01:05:04.967 --> 01:05:08.503
         What are those?
         - You tell us.

01:05:08.604 --> 01:05:11.239
        - It's not mine.

01:05:11.340 --> 01:05:13.308
   Stop, it's not mine. Stop!

01:05:13.409 --> 01:05:15.377
 - (officer): Save your stories
         for the police.

01:05:15.478 --> 01:05:17.646
       - (student): Don't
         tase me, dude!

01:05:17.747 --> 01:05:19.948
       (students laughing)

01:05:30.326 --> 01:05:34.296
             - Dad?

01:05:46.108 --> 01:05:50.545
     - Case number 14539-2,
     Natalie Jean Kellison,

01:05:50.646 --> 01:05:54.115
    possession of controlled
           substances.

01:05:54.216 --> 01:05:56.017
    - (Solomon): Your honour,
           if I may...

01:05:56.118 --> 01:05:59.754
        Bryce Solomon, attorney
              for Ms. Kellison.

01:05:59.855 --> 01:06:01.890
  - You're the public defender?
           - God, no.

01:06:01.991 --> 01:06:05.961
   I represent Delta Psi Beta.
- Trial date will be January 24,

01:06:06.062 --> 01:06:10.131
     bail is set at $50,000.

01:06:10.232 --> 01:06:13.902
   - Your honour, please, I--
   - You'll get your chance to
   speak at trial, young lady.

01:06:14.003 --> 01:06:15.870
           Next case.

01:06:22.478 --> 01:06:24.980
- Thanks so much
for bailing me out.

01:06:25.081 --> 01:06:26.982
            - I didn't. He did.

01:06:27.083 --> 01:06:29.184
    - Actually, Alexa Cooper
         paid your bail.

01:06:29.285 --> 01:06:32.387
- Why would she do that? She's
the reason I'm here in
the first place.

01:06:32.488 --> 01:06:35.957
- This is perhaps not the best
place to discuss the details
of your case.

01:06:36.058 --> 01:06:38.326
Spend some time
with your family.

01:06:38.427 --> 01:06:41.262
        We'll talk soon.

01:06:46.902 --> 01:06:48.636
       - (Natalie): Great.
         Now, on top of

01:06:48.738 --> 01:06:52.107
 everything else, I'm suspended
  for the rest of the semester.

01:06:52.208 --> 01:06:55.510
        - The school has
     a zero-tolerance policy
     when it comes to drugs.

01:06:55.611 --> 01:06:58.146
   - Whatever happened to being
  innocent until proven guilty?

01:06:58.247 --> 01:07:01.750
      - Uh, that's our law.
   The university has its own.

01:07:03.886 --> 01:07:06.788
       - You know, I still
      don't understand why
  Alexa would bail Natalie out.

01:07:06.889 --> 01:07:08.957
      - (Aiden): Plausible
          deniability.

01:07:09.058 --> 01:07:11.493
Makes her look legit.

01:07:11.594 --> 01:07:13.795
              - You keep quiet,
       the lawyer gets you off.

01:07:13.896 --> 01:07:17.032
       - Gets her off how?
         - Bryce Solomon

01:07:17.133 --> 01:07:19.801
 is a master of technicalities.
The guy's got a flawless record.

01:07:19.902 --> 01:07:22.203
  - (Danielle): Natalie doesn't
           play along,

01:07:22.304 --> 01:07:25.140
he loses his first case in years
      and she goes to jail.

01:07:25.241 --> 01:07:29.544
        Either way, Alexa
       is above reproach.

01:07:29.645 --> 01:07:32.814
      - You know, there must be
       one of these other girls

01:07:32.915 --> 01:07:34.816
                  who's willing
            to stand up to her.

01:07:34.917 --> 01:07:38.753
  - She surrounds herself with
     people she can control.

01:07:38.854 --> 01:07:42.757
- Sophia told me she has dirt on
     everyone, holds it over
          their heads.

01:07:42.858 --> 01:07:44.859
  - I've heard that too, I just
  thought it was urban legend.

01:07:49.098 --> 01:07:51.099
 - ...So she would have kept it.

01:07:51.200 --> 01:07:53.668
   - She would have kept what?
       - The memory card.

01:07:53.769 --> 01:07:56.905
 She was filming Sumner and all
       the girls when they were
              messing with him.

01:07:57.006 --> 01:07:59.174
     She was going to put it
    on the internet before...

01:07:59.275 --> 01:08:02.043
        - Before he died.

01:08:02.144 --> 01:08:05.080
- I see where you're going with
this. Does she incriminate
herself?

01:08:05.181 --> 01:08:07.515
    - No, she was holding the
 camera, but the other girls do.

01:08:07.616 --> 01:08:10.351
- Yeah, but you can't just break
    into her room to get it.

01:08:10.453 --> 01:08:12.754
 - Well, she wouldn't keep it in
     her room, she has girls

01:08:12.855 --> 01:08:15.757
   in and out of there all the
     time. She doesn't even
         lock her doors.

01:08:15.858 --> 01:08:18.660
        - If she does keep this
        kind of dirt on people,

01:08:18.761 --> 01:08:21.129
      she must have accumulated
            quite a collection.

01:08:21.229 --> 01:08:24.466
      - Her father's house!
           She's there

01:08:24.567 --> 01:08:27.435
     at least once a month.
    - Well, you sure as hell

01:08:27.536 --> 01:08:30.371
        can't break into
      a congressman's home.

01:08:30.473 --> 01:08:33.041
    - Well, I won't have to.
         I was invited.

01:08:33.142 --> 01:08:35.410
        Alexa's birthday party.

01:08:35.511 --> 01:08:38.912
   She has it there every year.

01:08:41.149 --> 01:08:43.051
               - This is crazy.
                 If that lawyer

01:08:43.152 --> 01:08:46.386
      can get you off, I'll hire
another one who can do the same.

01:08:46.488 --> 01:08:48.456
     You can go back to school,

01:08:48.557 --> 01:08:50.825
get on with your life and forget
        all about this sorority.

01:08:50.926 --> 01:08:53.461
- It's not just about
these charges, Dad.

01:08:53.562 --> 01:08:57.365
Someone needs to stand up
to this girl. I need to.

01:08:57.466 --> 01:09:01.136
For Sumner. For myself.

01:09:03.706 --> 01:09:06.006
            - I'm not gonna lie
             and say I approve.

01:09:09.345 --> 01:09:12.380
               But I'd probably
        do the same damn thing.

01:09:12.481 --> 01:09:15.416
           Be careful.
    - (mouthing): Thank you.

01:09:18.821 --> 01:09:22.590
       (knocking on door)
             Alexa?

01:09:22.691 --> 01:09:27.428
             - My, you have had
               quite a weekend.

01:09:27.529 --> 01:09:31.198
- Um... Yeah, I just wanted to
thank you for bailing me out.

01:09:31.300 --> 01:09:34.169
       - Hey, no problem,
        it's what we do.

01:09:34.270 --> 01:09:37.471
      - I also just wanted
          to apologize.

01:09:37.573 --> 01:09:40.073
       I mean, I was about
     to make a big mistake.

01:09:40.176 --> 01:09:42.109
           - Were you?

01:09:42.211 --> 01:09:45.345
   - Let's just say, I've had
    a bit of a wake-up call.

01:09:45.447 --> 01:09:49.684
    - And...you're awake now?
          - Wide awake.

01:09:49.785 --> 01:09:52.554
             - Good.

01:09:52.654 --> 01:09:54.656
   It's good to have you back.

01:09:56.659 --> 01:09:59.394
       - All right, then.
        - See you later.

01:10:02.398 --> 01:10:06.968
          - Oh... Hey.
             - Hey.

01:10:07.069 --> 01:10:09.871
            - Look...

01:10:09.972 --> 01:10:12.440
        I'm really sorry.

01:10:12.541 --> 01:10:15.109
           - It's OK.

01:10:15.211 --> 01:10:17.645
            - Just--

01:10:20.149 --> 01:10:22.350
I just feel like I got you
into this whole mess.

01:10:22.451 --> 01:10:25.320
        - Don't worry about it.

01:10:25.421 --> 01:10:28.189
    We're good. We're all good.

01:10:28.290 --> 01:10:30.558
       So, luckily for us,

01:10:30.659 --> 01:10:33.494
the congressman is
a shameless self-promoter.

01:10:33.596 --> 01:10:35.730
He was featured in
<i>Architecture Monthly.</i>

01:10:35.831 --> 01:10:38.032
          There are 7 bedrooms,

01:10:38.133 --> 01:10:40.034
            2 on the main floor

01:10:40.135 --> 01:10:42.837
and 5 upstairs, including
the master suite.

01:10:42.938 --> 01:10:45.340
     - How do you know that?
 - I just extrapolated the data.

01:10:45.441 --> 01:10:47.342
         There were also
       some photos I used

01:10:47.443 --> 01:10:50.011
from the magazine
for reference.

01:10:54.250 --> 01:10:58.853
       - That is amazing!
   - That's Natalie - amazing.

01:10:58.954 --> 01:11:01.623
  - So, I'm going to make sure
       Alexa is occupied,

01:11:01.724 --> 01:11:03.725
while my lovely assistant Nikki
finds out which room is hers.

01:11:03.826 --> 01:11:06.094
        - I already know
       which room is hers.

01:11:06.195 --> 01:11:11.032
             - How?
         - Easy. The one
    with the biggest closet.

01:11:11.133 --> 01:11:13.568
  - How are you going to get in
            in the first place?

01:11:13.669 --> 01:11:16.604
       I mean, you don't really
     look like a sorority girl.

01:11:16.705 --> 01:11:18.606
- I'll take that
as a compliment.

01:11:18.707 --> 01:11:21.709
- The party's being catered,
so Nikki's gonna pose as
one of the waiters.

01:11:21.810 --> 01:11:23.978
     - Sadly, as an aspiring
            musician,

01:11:24.079 --> 01:11:26.381
 I've had plenty of experience.

01:11:26.482 --> 01:11:28.850
          - How does that work?
Wouldn't they have to hire you?

01:11:28.951 --> 01:11:31.853
   - These gigs are freelance.
   There are always, sort of,
    people coming in and out.

01:11:31.954 --> 01:11:34.856
   - OK, what about security?
    Her dad's a congressman.

01:11:34.957 --> 01:11:37.125
 It's bound to be pretty tight.

01:11:37.226 --> 01:11:39.560
- Well, it normally is, but her
parents are out of town

01:11:39.662 --> 01:11:41.863
for the weekend, so she has
the place all to herself.

01:11:41.964 --> 01:11:42.930
  - Her parents are out of town
               on her birthday?

01:11:43.032 --> 01:11:44.932
- I know, right?

01:11:45.034 --> 01:11:47.635
       - What if she has a safe
        or something like that?

01:11:47.736 --> 01:11:49.771
        - I'll crack it.

01:11:51.874 --> 01:11:55.243
- Just kidding! We'd be screwed.

01:11:55.344 --> 01:11:58.079
       - Thank you, girls,
         for doing this.

01:11:58.180 --> 01:12:02.784
    - Someone needs to bring
        this bitch down.
        - What she said.

01:12:02.885 --> 01:12:07.622
       - You really think
       she's come around?
      - So it would appear.

01:12:07.723 --> 01:12:10.358
   - I still don't trust her.
     - Like my daddy's fond

01:12:10.459 --> 01:12:13.494
      of saying, you don't
          trust people.

01:12:13.595 --> 01:12:15.596
            Own them.

01:12:15.698 --> 01:12:18.700
      (dance music playing)

01:12:37.286 --> 01:12:39.687
   (camera shutters clicking)

01:12:47.062 --> 01:12:50.198
    - Oh, my-- The invitation
         said no gifts!

01:12:50.299 --> 01:12:52.500
    - We can take them back.
         - Oh, shut up!

01:12:52.601 --> 01:12:54.936
       Put them over there
  and make yourselves at home.

01:12:55.037 --> 01:12:58.272
       Champagne, ladies?
             - Yeah!

01:13:20.295 --> 01:13:22.697
          - You ready?
 - Ready to put this tray down.

01:13:22.798 --> 01:13:24.832
    You know I hate seafood.

01:13:24.933 --> 01:13:41.015
- You're a rock star.

01:14:26.595 --> 01:14:28.830
- Hey, girl...

01:14:28.931 --> 01:14:30.932
        - (Natalie): Hey!

01:14:34.069 --> 01:14:36.804
  - (slurring words): You know
 what? You really are the best.

01:14:45.380 --> 01:14:47.381
      (cell phone dinging)

01:14:50.052 --> 01:14:53.821
            Sisters!
      - I'll be right back.

01:15:05.300 --> 01:15:08.302
           Uh, Alexa!

01:15:08.403 --> 01:15:10.605
 - I'll be right back, I'm just
  going to freshen up a little.

01:15:10.706 --> 01:15:13.341
- I saw a guy and a girl heading
  into one of the bedrooms down
           the hall...

01:15:13.442 --> 01:15:17.078
        - Oh, it's cool.
 - Uh, she looked pretty wasted.

01:15:17.179 --> 01:15:22.016
    Like she was gonna hurl.
     - OK, that's not cool.

01:15:22.117 --> 01:15:24.986
    I hate when that happens.

01:15:27.589 --> 01:15:29.757
      (cell phone ringing)

01:15:29.858 --> 01:15:32.126
             - Hey.
 - OK, you have to hurry, she's

01:15:32.227 --> 01:15:35.029
 gonna be upstairs in a minute.
     - OK, there's a locked

01:15:35.130 --> 01:15:37.698
  jewellery box in her closet,
       it's the only place
          left to look.

01:15:37.799 --> 01:15:40.201
     - Can you get it open?
  - If I had some tools, maybe.

01:15:42.204 --> 01:15:45.006
       - Never mind, just
        get out of there.

01:15:45.107 --> 01:15:47.808
       - There was no one
         in the bedroom.

01:15:47.910 --> 01:15:51.679
   - Oh! She must have been too
          drunk to, you know...

01:15:51.780 --> 01:15:54.115
       - Ha ha! Yeah, hate when
                  that happens.

01:16:02.558 --> 01:16:05.259
       - Oh! What are you
         doing up here?

01:16:05.360 --> 01:16:08.563
- I was just looking
for the bathroom.

01:16:08.664 --> 01:16:11.566
    Oh, we have 11 bathrooms,
    but the one for the help
      is right downstairs.

01:16:11.667 --> 01:16:15.236
         - Oh... My bad.
          - No worries.

01:16:25.847 --> 01:16:27.748
             - Hey.
        - Sure you looked

01:16:27.849 --> 01:16:31.385
       everywhere? ...OK.
      - Everywhere...except
     for that jewellery box.

01:16:31.486 --> 01:16:33.888
 - Ahem... We're not paying you
      to bother the guests.

01:16:33.989 --> 01:16:36.490
 - Oh... She's not bothering me.

01:16:36.592 --> 01:16:39.560
- Yes, well, she still has a job
 to do, so if you don't mind...

01:16:39.661 --> 01:16:43.364
             - OK...

01:17:14.796 --> 01:17:17.798
 - Hey! Just where do you think
          you're going?

01:17:17.899 --> 01:17:20.001
 - Um... Girl problems.

01:17:20.102 --> 01:17:23.170
       Trust me, you don't want
           to know the details.

01:17:32.381 --> 01:17:34.382
   - My grandmother's jewels.

01:17:34.483 --> 01:17:36.951
     Beautiful, aren't they?

01:17:40.389 --> 01:17:42.356
       I knew something was up.

01:17:42.457 --> 01:17:46.661
                    You gave in
        a little too willingly.

01:17:46.762 --> 01:17:49.563
       Tell me, what is it that
    you're hoping to find, hmm?

01:17:49.665 --> 01:17:51.999
     Wait, let me guess. Drugs?

01:17:52.100 --> 01:17:58.039
               No... The video?

01:17:58.140 --> 01:18:00.374
                     Of course!
   'Cause the video would prove

01:18:00.475 --> 01:18:02.376
             your little story,
                   wouldn't it?

01:18:02.477 --> 01:18:04.779
- It's not a story!
A guy is dead because of you!

01:18:04.880 --> 01:18:07.114
      - This is getting boring.

01:18:07.215 --> 01:18:10.217
You really think that I would be
           stupid enough to keep
            something like that?

01:18:10.318 --> 01:18:13.421
 - That's what you do, isn't it?
      Keep dirt on people?

01:18:13.522 --> 01:18:17.591
   - I thought you were smarter
         than the rest of them.

01:18:17.693 --> 01:18:19.593
             Guess I was wrong.

01:18:19.695 --> 01:18:23.130
  - What are you talking about?
 - I don't need to "keep dirt",

01:18:23.231 --> 01:18:26.534
   as you call it. I just make
    people believe I have it.

01:18:26.635 --> 01:18:30.037
     - But Sophia, I mean...
- Sophia is a needy little bitch

01:18:30.138 --> 01:18:32.740
that would sell crack to her
mother just so she could
be popular.

01:18:32.841 --> 01:18:37.745
All of these girls;
weak, entitled, pitiful.

01:18:37.846 --> 01:18:39.947
The reason why they join
a sorority in the first place

01:18:40.048 --> 01:18:43.884
is to fill some sad, miserable
little hole in their heart.

01:18:43.985 --> 01:18:46.721
But you can relate to that,
can't you? Right?

01:18:46.822 --> 01:18:48.889
Mommy's little girl.

01:18:48.990 --> 01:18:51.358
          - Go to hell!

01:18:51.460 --> 01:18:53.427
     - But I have to give it
         to you, though.

01:18:53.528 --> 01:18:57.131
You have some <i> cojones,</i> coming in
   here, going all <i> Ocean's 11.</i>

01:18:57.232 --> 01:19:00.134
  - You know what? I don't care
  what happens to me, I'm going
       to tell the truth.

01:19:00.235 --> 01:19:03.904
         To the police,
       to the university,
to anyone who will listen to me.

01:19:04.005 --> 01:19:07.708
  - No one is going to listen,
       not without proof.

01:19:07.809 --> 01:19:10.211
              - How do you live
                 with yourself?

01:19:13.582 --> 01:19:16.183
- When I was younger,
I used to spend

01:19:16.284 --> 01:19:18.652
a lot of time in this room.

01:19:18.754 --> 01:19:22.123
      Any time my dad would
       fight with my mom,

01:19:22.224 --> 01:19:24.992
       or his second wife,

01:19:25.093 --> 01:19:27.828
          or his third.

01:19:27.929 --> 01:19:30.865
      I would come in here,

01:19:30.966 --> 01:19:34.135
      and just lose myself

01:19:34.236 --> 01:19:36.137
  in all my beautiful clothes.

01:19:36.238 --> 01:19:38.606
       - Oh, I'm supposed
   to feel sorry for you, now?

01:19:38.707 --> 01:19:41.275
- But the most important thing
I learned,

01:19:41.376 --> 01:19:45.079
I learned right here
in this room:

01:19:45.180 --> 01:19:47.948
I'm the only person in the world

01:19:48.049 --> 01:19:51.952
   that gives a damn about me.
       - You're pathetic.

01:19:55.724 --> 01:19:57.625
- If you don't mind,

01:19:57.726 --> 01:20:00.694
I have a party to attend to.

01:20:00.796 --> 01:20:02.696
Can you find your way out?

01:20:02.798 --> 01:20:06.333
  Silly me. Of course you can.

01:20:06.434 --> 01:20:09.003
     You found your way in.

01:20:09.104 --> 01:20:11.205
                       - Ugh...

01:20:20.749 --> 01:20:22.883
  - (Nikki): Natalie! Hold up!
  - Let's just get out of here.

01:20:22.984 --> 01:20:25.286
    - Just hang on. Come on.
             - What?

01:20:33.094 --> 01:20:37.131
          (music stops)
    - Yo, how y'all feelin'?

01:20:37.232 --> 01:20:38.933
         (all cheering)

01:20:39.034 --> 01:20:42.369
I got a little something special
          for you guys,

01:20:42.470 --> 01:20:44.839
       a birthday surprise
      for your girl Alexa.

01:20:44.940 --> 01:20:47.641
    (cheering and applauding)

01:20:49.945 --> 01:20:52.580
           You ready?

01:20:52.681 --> 01:20:55.482
             Hit it.
- (over loudspeakers): <i> - I don't</i>

01:21:47.836 --> 01:21:50.237
  - (Niroc): Natalie Kellison;

01:21:50.338 --> 01:21:53.474
  upon review of your testimony
        and the testimony

01:21:53.575 --> 01:21:57.311
   of so many of your sorority
   sisters, it is the decision
        of this committee

01:21:57.412 --> 01:21:59.413
     that you be reinstated
          immediately.

01:21:59.514 --> 01:22:03.417
                   - Thank you.

01:22:03.518 --> 01:22:05.653
- What about Alexa?
What happens to her?

01:22:05.754 --> 01:22:07.655
    -<i> Ms. Cooper has elected</i>

      Dinner looks amazing.
        - Yeah, it does.

01:22:48.396 --> 01:22:50.364
